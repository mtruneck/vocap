9
0:0:36,64 --> 0:0:39,1

Now, my grandmother was a wonderful person.


20
0:1:10,32 --> 0:1:13,72
She taught me how to play the game Monopoly.


21
0:1:13,72 --> 0:1:17,56
She understood that the name of the game is to acquire.


22
0:1:17,56 --> 0:1:19,6
She would accumulate everything she could


23
0:1:19,6 --> 0:1:23,2
and eventually, she became the master of the board.


24
0:1:23,2 --> 0:1:25,5
And then she would always say the same thing to me.


25
0:1:25,5 --> 0:1:27,4
She would look at me and she would say:


26
0:1:27,4 --> 0:1:30,96
“One day, you'll learn to play the game.”


27
0:1:30,96 --> 0:1:34,32
One summer, I played Monopoly almost every day, all day long.


28
0:1:34,32 --> 0:1:37,4
And that summer, I learned to play the game.


29
0:1:37,4 --> 0:1:39,76
I came to understand the only way to win


30
0:1:39,76 --> 0:1:42,68
is to make a total commitment to acquisition.


31
0:1:42,68 --> 0:1:44,96
I came to understand that money and possessions-


32
0:1:44,96 --> 0:1:48,4
that's the way that you keep score.


33
0:1:48,4 --> 0:1:51,639
And by the end of that summer, I was more ruthless than my grandmother.


34
0:1:51,639 --> 0:1:51,64
.


35
0:1:51,64 --> 0:1:55,88
I was ready to bend the rules if I had to, to win that game.


36
0:1:55,88 --> 0:1:59,2
And I sat down with her to play that fall.


37
0:1:59,2 --> 0:2:0,75
I took everything she had.


38
0:2:0,75 --> 0:2:6,4
I watched her give her last dollar and quit in utter defeat.


39
0:2:6,4 --> 0:2:10,8
And then she had one more thing to teach me.


40
0:2:10,8 --> 0:2:14,44
Then she said:


41
0:2:14,44 --> 0:2:20,16
“Now it all goes back in the box.

None of it was really yours.


47
0:2:38,24 --> 0:2:41,56
You got all heated up about it for a while.


48
0:2:41,56 --> 0:2:45,64
But it was around a long time before you sat down at the board


49
0:2:45,64 --> 0:2:52,2
and it will be here after you're gone: players come, players go.

54
0:3:4,8 --> 0:3:7,84
is going to go back in the box and I'm going to lose it all.


55
0:3:7,84 --> 0:3:9,8

80

82
0:6:11,4 --> 0:6:13,8

83

but that doesn't make it so.'


85
0:6:18,248 --> 0:6:21,62
I explained that America owed everything it has


86
0:6:21,62 --> 0:6:24,559
to other cultures and other nations


87
0:6:24,559 --> 0:6:24,56

93

94

96
0:6:42,63 --> 0:6:46,369

100

was not exempt from these laws.


101

Then came the crash of 1929


102
0:6:56,93 --> 0:6:59,14
which began what we now call


103
0:6:59,14 --> 0:7:0,9
“The Great Depression”.


104
0:7:0,9 --> 0:7:4,19
I found it difficult to understand why millions


105
0:7:4,19 --> 0:7:7,38
were out of work, homeless, starving,


106
0:7:7,38 --> 0:7:10,38
while all the factories were sitting there;


107
0:7:10,38 --> 0:7:13,1
the resources were unchanged.


108
0:7:13,1 --> 0:7:15,21
It was then that I realized


109
0:7:15,21 --> 0:7:18,18
that the rules of the economic game


110
0:7:18,18 --> 0:7:21,11
were inherently invalid.


111
0:7:21,11 --> 0:7:24,0
Shortly after, came World War II


112
0:7:24,0 --> 0:7:26,79

113
0:7:26,79 --> 0:7:29,74
systematically destroying each other.


114

0:12:51,6 --> 0:12:55,3
And in fact it looks as if some of the early


217
0:12:55,3 --> 0:13:0,4
childhood influences and the kind of child rearing,


218
0:13:0,4 --> 0:13:1,68
affect gene expression:


219
0:13:1,68 --> 0:13:4,48
actually turning on or off different genes


220
0:13:4,48 --> 0:13:8,24
to put you on a different developmental track


221
0:13:8,24 --> 0:13:12,16
which may suit the kind of world you've got to deal with.


222
0:13:12,16 --> 0:13:13,7
So for example,


223
0:13:13,7 --> 0:13:18,34
a study done in Montreal with suicide victims


224
0:13:18,34 --> 0:13:21,76
looked at autopsies of the brains of these people.


225
0:13:21,76 --> 0:13:24,36
And it turned out that if a suicide victim


226
0:13:24,36 --> 0:13:26,28
(these are usually young adults)


227
0:13:26,28 --> 0:13:29,7
had been abused as children, the abuse actually


228
0:13:29,7 --> 0:13:32,8
caused a genetic change in the brain


229
0:13:32,8 --> 0:13:37,8
that was absent in the brains of people who had not been abused.


230
0:13:37,8 --> 0:13:38,84
That's an epigenetic effect.


231
0:13:38,84 --> 0:13:41,96
“Epi” means on top of, so that


232
0:13:41,96 --> 0:13:45,28
the epigenetic influence is what happens


233
0:13:45,28 --> 0:13:51,44
environmentally to either activate or deactivate certain genes.


234
0:13:51,44 --> 0:13:53,6
In New Zealand, there was a study


235
0:13:53,6 --> 0:13:56,6
that was done in a town called Dunedin,


236
0:13:56,6 --> 0:14:1,15
in which a few thousand individuals


237
0:14:1,15 --> 0:14:5,52
were studied from birth into their 20s.


238
0:14:5,52 --> 0:14:11,8
What they found was that they could identify


239
0:14:11,8 --> 0:14:14,56
a genetic mutation- an abnormal gene-


240
0:14:14,56 --> 0:14:17,91
which did have some relation to


241
0:14:17,91 --> 0:14:21,12
the predisposition to commit violence,


242
0:14:21,12 --> 0:14:24,92
but only if the individual had also


243
0:14:24,92 --> 0:14:28,8
been subjected to severe child abuse.


244
0:14:28,8 --> 0:14:31,8
In other words, children with this abnormal gene


245
0:14:31,8 --> 0:14:34,36
would be no more likely to be violent than anybody else,


246
0:14:34,36 --> 0:14:37,44
and in fact, they actually had a lower rate of violence


247
0:14:37,44 --> 0:14:39,36
than people with normal genes


248
0:14:39,36 --> 0:14:43,1
as long as they weren't abused as children.


249
0:14:43,1 --> 0:14:45,12
Great additional example of the ways


250
0:14:45,12 --> 0:14:47,2
in which genes are not “be all - end all.”


251
0:14:47,2 --> 0:14:49,72
A fancy technique where you can


252
0:14:49,72 --> 0:14:52,8
take a specific gene out of a mouse,


253
0:14:52,8 --> 0:14:54,8
that mouse and its descendants will not have that gene.


254
0:14:54,8 --> 0:14:56,45
You have ”knocked out” that gene.


255
0:14:56,45 --> 0:14:58,95
So there's this one gene that encodes for a protein


256
0:14:58,95 --> 0:15:1,65
that has something to do with learning and memory.


257
0:15:1,65 --> 0:15:5,28
And with this fabulous demonstration you “knock out” that gene


258
0:15:5,28 --> 0:15:5,3
.


259
0:15:5,3 --> 0:15:7,52
and you have a mouse that doesn't learn as well.


260
0:15:7,52 --> 0:15:10,44
“Ooh! A genetic basis for intelligence!”


261
0:15:10,44 --> 0:15:13,8
What was much less appreciated in that landmark study


262
0:15:13,8 --> 0:15:16,24
that got picked up by the media left and right,


263
0:15:16,24 --> 0:15:19,48
is take those genetically impaired mice


264
0:15:19,48 --> 0:15:21,68
and raise them in a much more enriched


265
0:15:21,68 --> 0:15:24,8
stimulating environment than your normal mice in a lab cage,


266
0:15:24,8 --> 0:15:28,2
and they completely overcame that deficit.


267
0:15:28,2 --> 0:15:32,28
So, when one says in a contemporary sense that


268
0:15:32,28 --> 0:15:35,17
“Oh, this behavior is genetic”


269
0:15:35,17 --> 0:15:38,47
to the extent that that's even a valid sort of phrase to use,


270
0:15:38,47 --> 0:15:41,5
what you're saying is: there is a


271
0:15:41,5 --> 0:15:45,99
genetic contribution to how this organism responds to environment;


272
0:15:45,99 --> 0:15:46,0
.


273
0:15:46,0 --> 0:15:50,0
genes may influence the readiness with which


274
0:15:50,0 --> 0:15:53,39
an organism will deal with a certain environmental challenge.


275
0:15:53,39 --> 0:15:53,4
.


276
0:15:53,4 --> 0:15:56,65
You know, that's not the version most people have in their minds.


277
0:15:56,65 --> 0:15:59,7
And not to be too 'soap-boxing'


278
0:15:59,7 --> 0:16:4,56
but run with the old version of “It's genetic!” and


279
0:16:4,56 --> 0:16:4,8
.


280
0:16:4,8 --> 0:16:9,27
it's not that far from the history of Eugenics and things of that sort.


281
0:16:9,27 --> 0:16:9,28
.


282
0:16:9,28 --> 0:16:11,4
It's a widespread misconception


283
0:16:11,4 --> 0:16:14,36
and it's a potentially fairly dangerous one.


284
0:16:14,36 --> 0:16:18,0
One reason that the


285
0:16:18,0 --> 0:16:20,82
biological explanation for violence,


286
0:16:20,82 --> 0:16:24,45
one reason that hypothesis is potentially dangerous-


287
0:16:24,45 --> 0:16:27,99
it's not just misleading it can really do harm-


288
0:16:27,99 --> 0:16:28,0
.


289
0:16:28,0 --> 0:16:32,94
is because if you believe that, you could very easily say:


290
0:16:32,94 --> 0:16:32,95
.


291
0:16:32,95 --> 0:16:35,13
“Well, there's nothing we can do


292
0:16:35,13 --> 0:16:39,7
to change the predisposition people have to becoming violent.


293
0:16:39,7 --> 0:16:42,37
All we can do, if somebody becomes violent is


294
0:16:42,37 --> 0:16:45,79
punish them- lock them up or execute them-


295
0:16:45,79 --> 0:16:45,8
.


296
0:16:45,8 --> 0:16:48,8
but we don't need to worry about changing the


297
0:16:48,8 --> 0:16:52,78
social environment or the social preconditions


298
0:16:52,78 --> 0:16:55,52
that may lead people to become violent


299
0:16:55,52 --> 0:16:58,36
because that's irrelevant.”


300
0:16:58,36 --> 0:17:2,9
The genetic argument allows us the luxury of ignoring


301
0:17:2,9 --> 0:17:5,84
past and present historical and social factors.


302
0:17:5,84 --> 0:17:8,14
And in the words of Louis Menand


303
0:17:8,14 --> 0:17:11,39
who wrote in the New Yorker, very astutely he said:


304
0:17:11,39 --> 0:17:11,4
.


305
0:17:11,4 --> 0:17:15,58
“It's all in the genes, an explanation for the way things are


306
0:17:15,58 --> 0:17:18,1
that does not threaten the way things are.


307
0:17:18,1 --> 0:17:21,2
Why should someone feel unhappy or


308
0:17:21,2 --> 0:17:24,899
engage in antisocial behavior when that person is living


309
0:17:24,899 --> 0:17:25,0
.


310
0:17:25,0 --> 0:17:28,69
in the freest and most prosperous nation on Earth?


311
0:17:28,69 --> 0:17:30,65
It can't be the system.


312
0:17:30,65 --> 0:17:33,84
There must be a flaw in the wiring somewhere.”


313
0:17:33,84 --> 0:17:35,6
Which is a good way of putting it.


314
0:17:35,6 --> 0:17:39,3
So, the genetic argument is simply a cop-out


315
0:17:39,3 --> 0:17:41,32
which allows us to ignore


316
0:17:41,32 --> 0:17:44,84
the social and economic and political factors


317
0:17:44,84 --> 0:17:51,8

[ Case Study: Addiction ]


320
0:17:55,68 --> 0:17:59,89
Addictions are usually considered to be a drug-related issue.


321
0:17:59,89 --> 0:17:59,9
.


322
0:17:59,9 --> 0:18:4,7
But looking at it more broadly, I define addiction as any behavior


323
0:18:4,7 --> 0:18:4,8
.


324
0:18:4,8 --> 0:18:9,7
that is associated with craving, with temporary relief

327
0:18:11,68 --> 0:18:14,99
along with an impairment of control over it, so that the person


328
0:18:14,99 --> 0:18:18,44
wishes to give it up or promises to do so


329
0:18:18,44 --> 0:18:20,56
but can't follow through.


330
0:18:20,56 --> 0:18:23,24
And when you understand that, you see that

0:18:23,24 --> 0:18:26,7
there are many more addictions than simply those related to drugs.

There's the addiction to power. People that have power but

they want more and more; nothing is ever enough for them.

are far more devastating in their social consequences

0:19:4,32 --> 0:19:8,2
Yet, they are rewarded! And considered to be respectable.

In the United States they kill 400,000 people a year.

To such a degree that they are addicted

0:19:42,0 --> 0:19:44,48
about the impact of their activities

0:19:44,48 --> 0:19:47,56
which is typical for addicts, is denial!

addicted to profit, no matter what the cost.

[ The Myth ]


368
0:20:7,96 --> 0:20:10,84
There is a general myth that drugs, in themselves, are addictive.


369
0:20:10,84 --> 0:20:14,0
In fact, the war on drugs is predicated on the idea


370
0:20:14,0 --> 0:20:16,8
that if you interdict the source of drugs


371
0:20:16,8 --> 0:20:18,32
you can deal with addiction that way.


372
0:20:18,32 --> 0:20:21,72
Now, if you understand addiction in the broader sense


373
0:20:21,72 --> 0:20:24,24
we see that nothing in itself is addictive.


374
0:20:24,24 --> 0:20:27,48
No substance, no drug is by itself addictive


375
0:20:27,48 --> 0:20:29,48
and no behavior is by itself addictive.


376
0:20:29,48 --> 0:20:32,48
Many people can go shopping without becoming shopaholics.


377
0:20:32,48 --> 0:20:34,34
Not everyone becomes a food addict.


378
0:20:34,34 --> 0:20:37,32
Not everyone who drinks a glass of wine becomes an alcoholic.


379
0:20:37,32 --> 0:20:40,46
So the real issue is: what makes people susceptible?


380
0:20:40,46 --> 0:20:44,1
Because it's the combination of a susceptible individual


381
0:20:44,1 --> 0:20:47,4
and the potentially addictive substance or behavior


382
0:20:47,4 --> 0:20:51,76
that makes for the full flowering of addiction.


383
0:20:51,76 --> 0:20:54,75
In short, it's not the drug that's addictive,


384
0:20:54,75 --> 0:20:57,41
it's the question of the susceptibility of the individual


385
0:20:57,41 --> 0:21:0,8
to being addicted to a particular substance or behavior.

0:21:25,77 --> 0:21:29,89

that if you stress mothers during pregnancy

0:21:48,52 --> 0:21:50,7
their children are more likely to have traits


403

0:22:30,92 --> 0:22:32,55
and divert it to Germany;


418
0:22:32,55 --> 0:22:34,56
for three months everybody there was starving.


419
0:22:34,56 --> 0:22:36,75
Tens of thousands of people starve to death.


420
0:22:36,75 --> 0:22:38,9
What the Dutch hunger winter effect is:


421
0:22:38,9 --> 0:22:43,72
if you were a second or third trimester fetus during the starvation


422
0:22:43,72 --> 0:22:47,76
your body 'learned' something very unique during that time.


423
0:22:47,76 --> 0:22:50,44
As it turns out, second and third trimester is when


424
0:22:50,44 --> 0:22:53,56
your body is going about trying to learn about the environment:


425
0:22:53,56 --> 0:22:57,4
How menacing of a place is it out there?


426
0:22:57,4 --> 0:23:0,2
How plentiful? How much nutrients am I getting


427
0:23:0,2 --> 0:23:2,3
by way of mom's circulation?


428
0:23:2,3 --> 0:23:5,7
Be a fetus who was starving during that time and


429
0:23:5,7 --> 0:23:9,4
your body programs forever after to be


430
0:23:9,4 --> 0:23:13,96
really, really stingy with your sugar and fat


431
0:23:13,96 --> 0:23:16,5
and what you do is you store every bit of it.


432
0:23:16,5 --> 0:23:20,4
Be a Dutch Hunger Winter fetus and half a century later,


433
0:23:20,4 --> 0:23:23,419
everything else being equal, you are more likely to have


434
0:23:23,419 --> 0:23:23,42
.


435
0:23:23,42 --> 0:23:26,56
high blood pressure, obesity or metabolic syndrome.


436
0:23:26,56 --> 0:23:30,76
That is environment coming in a very unexpected place.


437
0:23:30,76 --> 0:23:34,36
You can stress animals in the laboratory when they're pregnant


438
0:23:34,36 --> 0:23:36,3
and their offspring will be more likely to use


439
0:23:36,3 --> 0:23:38,44
cocaine and alcohol as adults.


440
0:23:38,44 --> 0:23:42,32
You can stress human mothers. For example, in a British study


441
0:23:42,32 --> 0:23:44,92
women who were abused in pregnancy


442
0:23:44,92 --> 0:23:46,7
will have higher levels of the


443
0:23:46,7 --> 0:23:49,92
stress hormone cortisol in their placenta at birth


444
0:23:49,92 --> 0:23:52,8
and their children are more likely to have conditions


445
0:23:52,8 --> 0:23:55,6
that predispose them to addictions by age 7 or 8.


446
0:23:55,6 --> 0:23:58,66
So in utero stress already prepares the gun


447
0:23:58,66 --> 0:24:0,66
for all kinds of mental health issues.


448
0:24:0,66 --> 0:24:4,44
An Israeli study done on children


449
0:24:4,44 --> 0:24:7,2
born to mothers who were pregnant


450
0:24:7,2 --> 0:24:12,26
prior to the onset of the 1967 war...


451
0:24:12,26 --> 0:24:14,22
These women, of course, were very stressed


452
0:24:14,22 --> 0:24:16,92
and their offspring have a higher incidence of schizophrenia


453
0:24:16,92 --> 0:24:18,84
than the average cohort.


454
0:24:18,84 --> 0:24:22,9
So, there is plenty of evidence now that prenatal effects


455
0:24:22,9 --> 0:24:28,1
have a huge impact on the developing human being.


456
0:24:28,1 --> 0:24:30,2
[ Infancy ]


457
0:24:30,2 --> 0:24:32,25
The point about human development and specifically


458
0:24:32,25 --> 0:24:34,0
human brain development is that it occurs mostly


459
0:24:34,0 --> 0:24:37,12
under the impact of the environment and mostly after birth.


460
0:24:37,12 --> 0:24:37,32
.


461
0:24:37,32 --> 0:24:39,96
Now, if you compare us to a horse


462
0:24:39,96 --> 0:24:41,9
which can run on the first day of life


463
0:24:41,9 --> 0:24:45,0
we see that we are very undeveloped.


464
0:24:45,0 --> 0:24:49,64
We can't muster that much neurological coordination


465
0:24:49,64 --> 0:24:52,32
balance, muscle strength, visual acuity


466
0:24:52,32 --> 0:24:54,16
until a year and a half, two years of age.


467
0:24:54,16 --> 0:24:56,8
That's because the brain development in the horse


468
0:24:56,8 --> 0:24:58,68
happens in the safety of the womb


469
0:24:58,68 --> 0:25:1,86
and in the human being, it has to happen after birth,


470
0:25:1,86 --> 0:25:4,338
and that has to do with simple evolutionary logic.


471
0:25:4,338 --> 0:25:7,975
As the head gets larger, which is what makes us into human beings-


472
0:25:7,975 --> 0:25:10,1
the burgeoning of the forebrain


473
0:25:10,1 --> 0:25:13,7
is what creates the human species, actually.


474
0:25:13,7 --> 0:25:16,61
At the same time we walk on two legs, so our pelvis narrows


475
0:25:16,61 --> 0:25:20,899
to accommodate that. So now we have a narrower pelvis, a larger head- ...


476
0:25:20,899 --> 0:25:20,9
.


477
0:25:20,9 --> 0:25:22,596
Bingo! We have to be born prematurely.


478
0:25:22,596 --> 0:25:25,9
And that means the brain development that in other animals


479
0:25:25,9 --> 0:25:28,399
occurs in utero, in us, occurs after birth


480
0:25:28,399 --> 0:25:28,4
.


481
0:25:28,4 --> 0:25:32,4
and much of that under the impact of the environment.


482
0:25:32,4 --> 0:25:35,1
The concept of Neural Darwinism simply means


483
0:25:35,1 --> 0:25:38,15
that the circuits that get the appropriate input from the environment


484
0:25:38,15 --> 0:25:41,0
will develop optimally and the ones that don't


485
0:25:41,0 --> 0:25:43,827
will either not develop optimally or perhaps not at all.


486
0:25:43,827 --> 0:25:46,54
If you take a child with perfectly good eyes at birth


487
0:25:46,54 --> 0:25:48,8
and you put him in a dark room for five years


488
0:25:48,8 --> 0:25:51,0
he will be blind thereafter for the rest of his life


489
0:25:51,0 --> 0:25:55,3
because the circuits of vision require light waves for their development,


490
0:25:55,3 --> 0:25:58,16
and without that even the rudimentary circuits


491
0:25:58,16 --> 0:26:0,3
present and active at birth


492
0:26:0,3 --> 0:26:5,4
will atrophy and die and new ones will not develop.


493
0:26:5,4 --> 0:26:7,98
[ Memory ]


494
0:26:7,98 --> 0:26:10,37
There is a significant way in which


495
0:26:10,37 --> 0:26:15,95
early experiences shape adult behavior,


496
0:26:15,95 --> 0:26:18,4
and even and especially


497
0:26:18,4 --> 0:26:21,72
early experiences for which there is no recall memory.


498
0:26:21,72 --> 0:26:24,2
It turns out that there are two kinds of memory:


499
0:26:24,2 --> 0:26:26,6
there is explicit memory which is recall;


500
0:26:26,6 --> 0:26:29,45
this is when you can call back facts,


501
0:26:29,45 --> 0:26:32,56
details, episodes, circumstances.


502
0:26:32,56 --> 0:26:35,55
But the structure in the brain which is called the hippocampus


503
0:26:35,55 --> 0:26:37,64
which encodes recall memory


504
0:26:37,64 --> 0:26:40,4
doesn't even begin to develop fully until a year and a half


505
0:26:40,4 --> 0:26:42,5
and it is not fully developed until much later.


506
0:26:42,5 --> 0:26:45,1
Which is why hardly anybody has any recall memory


507
0:26:45,1 --> 0:26:47,24
prior to 18 months.


508
0:26:47,24 --> 0:26:49,979
But there is another kind of memory which is called implicit memory


509
0:26:49,979 --> 0:26:49,98
.


510
0:26:49,98 --> 0:26:52,96
which is in fact, an emotional memory


511
0:26:52,96 --> 0:26:56,45
where the emotional impact and the interpretation the child makes


512
0:26:56,45 --> 0:26:59,85
of those emotional experiences are ingrained in the brain


513
0:26:59,85 --> 0:27:3,499
in the form of nerve circuits ready to fire without specific recall.


514
0:27:3,499 --> 0:27:3,5
.


515
0:27:3,5 --> 0:27:6,769
So to give you a clear example, people who are adopted


516
0:27:6,769 --> 0:27:6,77
.


517
0:27:6,77 --> 0:27:9,68
have a lifelong sense of rejection very often.


518
0:27:9,68 --> 0:27:11,26
They can't recall the adoption.


519
0:27:11,26 --> 0:27:13,24
They can't recall the separation of the birth mother


520
0:27:13,24 --> 0:27:15,3
because there's nothing there to recall with.


521
0:27:15,3 --> 0:27:18,8
But the emotional memory of separation and rejection


522
0:27:18,8 --> 0:27:21,0
is deeply embedded in their brains.


523
0:27:21,0 --> 0:27:24,199
Hence, they are much more likely to experience a sense of rejection


524
0:27:24,199 --> 0:27:24,2
.


525
0:27:24,2 --> 0:27:26,53
and a great emotional upset


526
0:27:26,53 --> 0:27:30,199
when they perceive themselves as being rejected by other people.


527
0:27:30,199 --> 0:27:30,3
.


528
0:27:30,3 --> 0:27:32,0
That's not unique to people who are adopted


529
0:27:32,0 --> 0:27:33,66
but it is particularly strong in them


530
0:27:33,66 --> 0:27:36,3
because of this function of implicit memory.


531
0:27:36,3 --> 0:27:39,9
People who are addicted, given ...


532
0:27:39,9 --> 0:27:42,74
all the research literature and in my experience,


533
0:27:42,74 --> 0:27:47,2
the hard-core addicts virtually were all


534
0:27:47,2 --> 0:27:49,44
significantly abused as children


535
0:27:49,44 --> 0:27:51,6
or suffered severe emotional loss.


536
0:27:51,6 --> 0:27:54,1
Their emotional or implicit memories


537
0:27:54,1 --> 0:27:57,4
are those of a world that's not safe


538
0:27:57,4 --> 0:28:0,4
and not helpful, caregivers who were not to be trusted


539
0:28:0,4 --> 0:28:4,117
and relationships that are not


540
0:28:4,117 --> 0:28:6,3
safe enough to open up to vulnerably.


541
0:28:6,3 --> 0:28:7,96
And hence their responses tend to be


542
0:28:7,96 --> 0:28:12,189
to keep themselves separate from really intimate relationships;


543
0:28:12,189 --> 0:28:12,19
.


544
0:28:12,19 --> 0:28:14,81
not to trust caregivers, doctors


545
0:28:14,81 --> 0:28:17,6
and other people who are trying to help them


546
0:28:17,6 --> 0:28:20,12
and generally see the world as an unsafe place.


547
0:28:20,12 --> 0:28:24,98
And that is strictly a function of implicit memory


548
0:28:24,98 --> 0:28:32,16
which sometimes has to do with incidents they don't even recall.


549
0:28:32,16 --> 0:28:34,4
[ Touch ]


550
0:28:34,4 --> 0:28:37,27
Infants who are born premature are often in incubators


551
0:28:37,27 --> 0:28:39,45
and various types of gadgetry and machinery


552
0:28:39,45 --> 0:28:42,3
for weeks and perhaps months.


553
0:28:42,3 --> 0:28:44,3
It's now known that if these children


554
0:28:44,3 --> 0:28:47,6
are touched and stroked on the back for just 10 minutes a day,


555
0:28:47,6 --> 0:28:49,74
that promotes their brain development.


556
0:28:49,74 --> 0:28:52,6
So, human touch is essential for development


557
0:28:52,6 --> 0:28:56,45
and in fact, infants who are never picked up will actually die.


558
0:28:56,45 --> 0:28:59,25
That is how much of a fundamental need


559
0:28:59,25 --> 0:29:1,58
being held is to human beings.


560
0:29:1,58 --> 0:29:4,34
In our society, there is an unfortunate tendency


561
0:29:4,34 --> 0:29:7,2
to tell parents not to pick up their kids, not to hold them,


562
0:29:7,2 --> 0:29:12,92
not to pick up babies who are crying for fear of spoiling them or


563
0:29:12,92 --> 0:29:16,199
to encourage them to sleep through the night- you don't pick them up-


564
0:29:16,199 --> 0:29:16,2
.


565
0:29:16,2 --> 0:29:18,74
which is just the opposite of what the child needs.


566
0:29:18,74 --> 0:29:22,1
And these children might go back to sleep because they give up


567
0:29:22,1 --> 0:29:25,0
and their brains just shut down as a way of


568
0:29:25,0 --> 0:29:27,2
defending against the vulnerability


569
0:29:27,2 --> 0:29:30,4
of being abandoned really by their parents.


570
0:29:30,4 --> 0:29:32,17
But their implicit memories will be


571
0:29:32,17 --> 0:29:35,72
that of the world that doesn't give a damn.


572
0:29:35,72 --> 0:29:37,84
[ Childhood ]


573
0:29:37,84 --> 0:29:43,45
A lot of these differences are structured very early in life.


574
0:29:43,45 --> 0:29:48,28
In a way, the parental experience of adversity-


575
0:29:48,28 --> 0:29:52,839
how tough life is or how easy it is- is passed on to children


576
0:29:52,839 --> 0:29:52,84
.


577
0:29:52,84 --> 0:29:55,2
whether through maternal depression


578
0:29:55,2 --> 0:29:58,39
or parents being bad tempered with their kids because they have


579
0:29:58,39 --> 0:29:58,4
.


580
0:29:58,4 --> 0:30:2,52
had a hard day or just being too tired at the end of the day.


581
0:30:2,52 --> 0:30:5,8
And these have very powerful effects


582
0:30:5,8 --> 0:30:9,88
programming children's development, which we know a lot about now.


583
0:30:9,88 --> 0:30:14,76
But that early sensitivity isn't just an evolutionary mistake.


584
0:30:14,76 --> 0:30:17,45
It exists again in many different species.


585
0:30:17,45 --> 0:30:20,57
Even in seedlings, there's an early adaptive process


586
0:30:20,57 --> 0:30:22,82
to the kind of environment they are growing up in.


587
0:30:22,82 --> 0:30:28,32
But for humans, the adaptation is to the quality of social relations.


588
0:30:28,32 --> 0:30:31,4
And so, early life:


589
0:30:31,4 --> 0:30:36,2
how nurturing, how much conflict, how much attention you get-


590
0:30:36,2 --> 0:30:40,24
is a taster of the kind of world you may be growing up in.


591
0:30:40,24 --> 0:30:42,8
Are you growing up in a world where you have to


592
0:30:42,8 --> 0:30:44,28
fight for what you can get, watch your back,


593
0:30:44,28 --> 0:30:47,4
fend for yourself, learn not to trust others?


594
0:30:47,4 --> 0:30:50,36
Or are you growing up in a society where you depend on


595
0:30:50,36 --> 0:30:55,24
reciprocity, mutuality, cooperation, where empathy is important,


596
0:30:55,24 --> 0:30:59,4
where your security depends on good relations with other people?


597
0:30:59,4 --> 0:31:3,629
And that needs a very different emotional and cognitive development.


598
0:31:3,629 --> 0:31:3,63
.


599
0:31:3,63 --> 0:31:6,73
And that's what the early sensitivity is about.


600
0:31:6,73 --> 0:31:10,69
And parenting is almost- quite unconsciously-


601
0:31:10,69 --> 0:31:14,2
a system for passing on that experience to children,


602
0:31:14,2 --> 0:31:16,66
of the kind of world they are in.


603
0:31:16,66 --> 0:31:20,32
The great British child psychiatrist, D.W. Winnicott, said


604
0:31:20,32 --> 0:31:23,4
that fundamentally, two things can go wrong in childhood.


605
0:31:23,4 --> 0:31:26,48
One is when things happen that shouldn't happen


606
0:31:26,48 --> 0:31:29,6
and then things that should happen but don't.


607
0:31:29,6 --> 0:31:33,66
In the first category, is the traumatic and abusive


608
0:31:33,66 --> 0:31:36,4
and abandonment experiences of my


609
0:31:36,4 --> 0:31:39,65
downtown Eastside patients and of many addicts.


610
0:31:39,65 --> 0:31:42,8
That's what shouldn't happen but did.


611
0:31:42,8 --> 0:31:46,72
But then there is the non-stressed, attuned,


612
0:31:46,72 --> 0:31:51,229
non-distracted attention of the parent that every child needs


613
0:31:51,229 --> 0:31:51,23
.


614
0:31:51,23 --> 0:31:53,25
that very often children don't get.


615
0:31:53,25 --> 0:31:55,68
They're not abused. They are not neglected


616
0:31:55,68 --> 0:31:58,0
and they're not traumatized.


617
0:31:58,0 --> 0:31:59,77
But what should happen-


618
0:31:59,77 --> 0:32:2,88
the presence of the emotionally available nurturing parent-


619
0:32:2,88 --> 0:32:4,9
just is not available to them because


620
0:32:4,9 --> 0:32:8,0
of the stresses in our society and the parenting environment.


621
0:32:8,0 --> 0:32:14,24
The psychologist Allan Schore calls that "Proximal Abandonment"


622
0:32:14,24 --> 0:32:19,5
when the parent is physically present but emotionally absent.


623
0:32:19,5 --> 0:32:20,44
.


624
0:32:20,44 --> 0:32:23,24
I have spent


625
0:32:23,24 --> 0:32:27,4
roughly the last 40 years of my life


626
0:32:27,4 --> 0:32:32,5
working with the most violent of people our society produces:


627
0:32:32,5 --> 0:32:34,3
murderers, rapists and so on.


628
0:32:34,3 --> 0:32:38,0
In an attempt to understand what causes this violence,


629
0:32:38,0 --> 0:32:42,48
I discovered that the most violent of the criminals in our prisons


630
0:32:42,48 --> 0:32:45,44
had themselves been victims


631
0:32:45,44 --> 0:32:48,28
of a degree of child abuse that was beyond the scale


632
0:32:48,28 --> 0:32:51,19
of what I ever thought of applying the term child abuse to.


633
0:32:51,19 --> 0:32:54,7
I had no idea of the depth


634
0:32:54,7 --> 0:32:58,64
of the depravity with which children in our society


635
0:32:58,64 --> 0:33:1,2
are all too often treated.


636
0:33:1,2 --> 0:33:4,69
The most violent people I saw were themselves the survivors


637
0:33:4,69 --> 0:33:7,9
of their own attempted murder often at the hands of their


638
0:33:7,9 --> 0:33:11,22
parents or other people in their social environment


639
0:33:11,22 --> 0:33:14,6
or were the survivors of family members who had been killed-


640
0:33:14,6 --> 0:33:19,28
their closest family members- by other people.


641
0:33:19,28 --> 0:33:23,84
The Buddha argued that everything depends on everything else.


642
0:33:23,84 --> 0:33:26,85
He says 'The one contains the many and the many contains the one.'


643
0:33:26,85 --> 0:33:30,45
That you can't understand anything in isolation from its environment.


644
0:33:30,45 --> 0:33:38,56
The leaf contains the sun, the sky and the earth, obviously.


645
0:33:38,56 --> 0:33:41,55
This has now been shown to be true, of course all around


646
0:33:41,55 --> 0:33:44,8
and specifically when it comes to human development.


647
0:33:44,8 --> 0:33:47,1
The modern scientific term for it


648
0:33:47,1 --> 0:33:49,85
is the "bio-psycho-social" nature of human development


649
0:33:49,85 --> 0:33:52,14
which says that the biology of human beings


650
0:33:52,14 --> 0:33:54,6
depends very much on their interaction with


651
0:33:54,6 --> 0:33:56,75
the social and psychological environment.


652
0:33:56,75 --> 0:34:2,36
And specifically, the psychiatrist and researcher


653
0:34:2,36 --> 0:34:6,9
Daniel Siegel at the University of California, Los Angeles, UCLA


654
0:34:6,9 --> 0:34:10,18
has coined a phrase “Interpersonal Neurobiology”


655
0:34:10,18 --> 0:34:14,719
which means to say that the way that our nervous system functions


656
0:34:14,719 --> 0:34:17,499
depends very much on our personal relationships:


657
0:34:17,499 --> 0:34:20,0
in the first place with the parenting caregivers,


658
0:34:20,0 --> 0:34:22,0
and in the second place with other important


659
0:34:22,0 --> 0:34:23,7
attachment figures in our lives


660
0:34:23,7 --> 0:34:26,6
and in the third place, with our entire culture.


661
0:34:26,6 --> 0:34:28,7
So that you can't separate the


662
0:34:28,7 --> 0:34:31,14
neurological functioning of a human being


663
0:34:31,14 --> 0:34:35,8
from the environment in which he or she grew up in


664
0:34:35,8 --> 0:34:37,56
and continues to exist in.


665
0:34:37,56 --> 0:34:40,32
And this is true throughout the life cycle.


666
0:34:40,32 --> 0:34:42,12
It's particularly true when you are


667
0:34:42,12 --> 0:34:44,97
dependent and helpless when your brain is developing


668
0:34:44,97 --> 0:34:51,25
but it's true even in adults and even at the end of life.


669
0:34:51,25 --> 0:34:53,24
[ Culture ]


670
0:34:53,24 --> 0:34:56,84
Human beings have lived in almost every kind of society,


671
0:34:56,84 --> 0:34:59,69
from the most egalitarian-


672
0:34:59,69 --> 0:35:3,56
hunting and gathering societies seem to have been very egalitarian-


673
0:35:3,56 --> 0:35:6,601
for instance based on food sharing, gift exchange...


674
0:35:6,601 --> 0:35:9,4
Small bands of people living


675
0:35:9,4 --> 0:35:13,16
predominately off of foraging and a little bit of hunting,


676
0:35:13,16 --> 0:35:15,24
predominantly among people you have


677
0:35:15,24 --> 0:35:17,28
at the least, known your entire life


678
0:35:17,28 --> 0:35:20,24
if not surrounded by third cousins or closer,


679
0:35:20,24 --> 0:35:22,2
in a world in which there is a great deal


680
0:35:22,2 --> 0:35:24,24
of fluidity between different groups,


681
0:35:24,24 --> 0:35:25,95
in a world which there is not


682
0:35:25,95 --> 0:35:28,12
a whole lot in terms of material culture...


683
0:35:28,12 --> 0:35:31,4
this is how humans have spent most of their hominid history.


684
0:35:31,4 --> 0:35:34,5
And, no surprise, that makes for a very different world.


685
0:35:34,5 --> 0:35:38,9
One of the things you get as a result of that is far less violence.


686
0:35:38,9 --> 0:35:41,8
Organized group violence is


687
0:35:41,8 --> 0:35:43,5
not something that occurred at that time


688
0:35:43,5 --> 0:35:46,89
of human history and that seems quite clear.


689
0:35:46,89 --> 0:35:50,24
So where did we go wrong?


690
0:35:50,24 --> 0:35:56,58
Violence is not universal. It is not symmetrically distributed


691
0:35:56,58 --> 0:36:0,45
throughout the human race. There is a huge variation


692
0:36:0,45 --> 0:36:3,4
in the amount of violence in different societies.


693
0:36:3,4 --> 0:36:7,28
There are some societies that have virtually no violence.


694
0:36:7,28 --> 0:36:10,84
There are others that destroy themselves!


695
0:36:10,84 --> 0:36:16,16
Some of the Anabaptist religious groups


696
0:36:16,16 --> 0:36:18,4
that are complete strict pacifists


697
0:36:18,4 --> 0:36:21,24
like the Amish, the Mennonites, the Hutterites...


698
0:36:21,24 --> 0:36:24,4
Among some of these groups, the Hutterites-


699
0:36:24,4 --> 0:36:29,85
there are no recorded cases of homicide.


700
0:36:29,85 --> 0:36:33,0
During our major wars, like World War II


701
0:36:33,0 --> 0:36:34,64
where people were being drafted


702
0:36:34,64 --> 0:36:36,9
they would refuse to serve in the military.


703
0:36:36,9 --> 0:36:40,3
They would go to prison rather than serve in the military.


704
0:36:40,3 --> 0:36:42,44
In the Kibbutzim in Israel


705
0:36:42,44 --> 0:36:45,92
the level of violence is so low that the criminal courts there


706
0:36:45,92 --> 0:36:48,95
will often send violent offenders


707
0:36:48,95 --> 0:36:51,4
-people who have committed crimes-


708
0:36:51,4 --> 0:36:54,12
to live on the Kibbutzim in order to


709
0:36:54,12 --> 0:36:56,2
learn how to live a non-violent life.


710
0:36:56,2 --> 0:36:58,52
Because that's the way people live there.


711
0:36:58,52 --> 0:37:2,24
So, we are amply shaped by society.


712
0:37:2,24 --> 0:37:7,52
Our societies, in the broader sense, including our theological,


713
0:37:7,52 --> 0:37:11,0
our metaphysical, our linguistic influences, etc.,


714
0:37:11,0 --> 0:37:14,84
our societies help shape us as to whether or not we think


715
0:37:14,84 --> 0:37:18,8
life is basically about sin or about beauty;


716
0:37:18,8 --> 0:37:20,75
whether the afterlife will carry a price


717
0:37:20,75 --> 0:37:23,65
for how we live our lives or if it's irrelevant.


718
0:37:23,65 --> 0:37:27,0
In a broad sort of way, different large societies


719
0:37:27,0 --> 0:37:30,6
could be termed as individualistic or collectivist, and


720
0:37:30,6 --> 0:37:33,399
you get very different people and different mindsets and


721
0:37:33,399 --> 0:37:33,4
.


722
0:37:33,4 --> 0:37:35,72
I suspect different brains coming along with that.


723
0:37:35,72 --> 0:37:41,0
We, in America, are in one of the most individualistic of societies,


724
0:37:41,0 --> 0:37:43,92
with capitalism being a system that allows you to go


725
0:37:43,92 --> 0:37:47,56
higher and higher up a potential pyramid and


726
0:37:47,56 --> 0:37:50,56
the deal is that it comes with fewer and fewer safety nets.


727
0:37:50,56 --> 0:37:54,1
By definition, the more stratified a society is,


728
0:37:54,1 --> 0:37:57,6
the fewer people you have as peers; the fewer people with whom


729
0:37:57,6 --> 0:38:0,88
you have symmetrical, reciprocal relationships


730
0:38:0,88 --> 0:38:5,7
and instead, all you have are differing spots and endless hierarchies.


731
0:38:5,7 --> 0:38:9,1
A world in which you have few reciprocal partners


732
0:38:9,1 --> 0:38:14,32
is a world with a lot less altruism.


733
0:38:14,32 --> 0:38:17,84
[Human Nature]


734
0:38:17,84 --> 0:38:22,2
So, this brings us to a total impossible juncture which is


735
0:38:22,2 --> 0:38:25,52
to try to make sense in perspective science


736
0:38:25,52 --> 0:38:28,2
as to what that nature is of human nature.


737
0:38:28,2 --> 0:38:30,68
You know, on a certain level


738
0:38:30,68 --> 0:38:33,24
the nature of our nature is not to be


739
0:38:33,24 --> 0:38:36,0
particularly constrained by our nature.


740
0:38:36,0 --> 0:38:37,84
We come up with more social


741
0:38:37,84 --> 0:38:40,44
variability than any species out there.


742
0:38:40,44 --> 0:38:44,76
More systems of belief, of styles, of family structures,


743
0:38:44,76 --> 0:38:47,76
of ways of raising children. The capacity


744
0:38:47,76 --> 0:38:52,0
for variety that we have is extraordinary.


745
0:38:52,0 --> 0:38:55,56
In a society which is predicated on competition


746
0:38:55,56 --> 0:39:1,4
and really, very often, the ruthless exploitation


747
0:39:1,4 --> 0:39:3,8
of one human being by another-


748
0:39:3,8 --> 0:39:6,28
the profiteering off of other people's problems


749
0:39:6,28 --> 0:39:8,95
and very often the creation of problems


750
0:39:8,95 --> 0:39:11,64
for the purpose of profiteering-


751
0:39:11,64 --> 0:39:14,92
the ruling ideology will very often justify that behavior


752
0:39:14,92 --> 0:39:19,0
by appeals to some fundamental and unalterable human nature.


753
0:39:19,0 --> 0:39:20,72
So the myth in our society


754
0:39:20,72 --> 0:39:22,92
is that people are competitive by nature


755
0:39:22,92 --> 0:39:27,12
and that they are individualistic and that they're selfish.


756
0:39:27,12 --> 0:39:30,1
The real reality is quite the opposite.


757
0:39:30,1 --> 0:39:31,72
We have certain human needs.


758
0:39:31,72 --> 0:39:34,52
The only way that you can talk about human nature concretely


759
0:39:34,52 --> 0:39:37,24
is by recognizing that there are certain human needs.


760
0:39:37,24 --> 0:39:40,4
We have a human need for companionship and for close contact,


761
0:39:40,4 --> 0:39:43,48
to be loved, to be attached to, to be accepted,


762
0:39:43,48 --> 0:39:47,52
to be seen, to be received for who we are.


763
0:39:47,52 --> 0:39:50,4
If those needs are met, we develop


764
0:39:50,4 --> 0:39:56,7
into people who are compassionate and cooperative and


765
0:39:56,7 --> 0:39:58,44
who have empathy for other people.


766
0:39:58,44 --> 0:40:1,2
So...


767
0:40:1,2 --> 0:40:3,82
the opposite, that we often see in our society,


768
0:40:3,82 --> 0:40:5,88
is in fact, a distortion of human nature


769
0:40:5,88 --> 0:40:9,4
precisely because so few people have their needs met.


770
0:40:9,4 --> 0:40:11,68
So, yes you can talk about human nature


771
0:40:11,68 --> 0:40:14,2
but only in the sense of basic human needs


772
0:40:14,2 --> 0:40:16,36
that are instinctively evoked


773
0:40:16,36 --> 0:40:18,72
or I should say, certain human needs


774
0:40:18,72 --> 0:40:21,64
that lead to certain traits if they are met


775
0:40:21,64 --> 0:40:27,2
and a different set of traits if they are denied.


776
0:40:27,2 --> 0:40:28,8
So...


777
0:40:28,8 --> 0:40:31,8
when we recognize the fact that the human organism,


778
0:40:31,8 --> 0:40:34,48
which has a great deal of adaptive flexibility


779
0:40:34,48 --> 0:40:37,84
allowing us to survive in many different conditions,


780
0:40:37,84 --> 0:40:42,12
is also rigidly programmed for certain environmental requirements


781
0:40:42,12 --> 0:40:44,52
or human needs,


782
0:40:44,52 --> 0:40:47,92
a social imperative begins to emerge.


783
0:40:47,92 --> 0:40:50,76
Just as our bodies require physical nutrients,


784
0:40:50,76 --> 0:40:55,16
the human brain demands positive forms of environmental stimulus


785
0:40:55,16 --> 0:40:57,64
at all stages of development,


786
0:40:57,64 --> 0:40:59,9
while also needing to be protected


787
0:40:59,9 --> 0:41:3,8
from other negative forms of stimulus.


788
0:41:3,8 --> 0:41:5,6
And if things that should happen, do not...


789
0:41:5,6 --> 0:41:8,16
or if things that shouldn't happen, do...


790
0:41:8,16 --> 0:41:11,48
it is now apparent that the door can be opened for not only


791
0:41:11,48 --> 0:41:14,64
a cascade of mental and physical diseases


792
0:41:14,64 --> 0:41:18,4
but many detrimental human behaviors as well.


793
0:41:18,4 --> 0:41:21,8
So, as we turn our perspective now outward


794
0:41:21,8 --> 0:41:23,92
and take account for the state of affairs today,


795
0:41:23,92 --> 0:41:26,16
we must ask the question:


796
0:41:26,16 --> 0:41:28,92
Is the condition we have created in the modern world


797
0:41:28,92 --> 0:41:31,8
actually supporting our health?


798
0:41:31,8 --> 0:41:35,5
Is the bedrock of our socioeconomic system


799
0:41:35,5 --> 0:41:36,78
acting as a positive force


800
0:41:36,78 --> 0:41:40,36
for human and social development and progress?


801
0:41:40,36 --> 0:41:44,4
Or, is the foundational gravitation of our society


802
0:41:44,4 --> 0:41:48,92
actually going against the core evolutionary requirements


803
0:41:48,92 --> 0:41:51,48
needed to create and maintain


804
0:41:51,48 --> 0:42:11,56
our personal and social well-being?

[Part II: Social Pathology]


806
0:42:17,96 --> 0:42:21,56
So, one might ask where did this all begin?


807
0:42:21,56 --> 0:42:24,94
what we have today... really a world in a state of


808
0:42:24,94 --> 0:42:27,88
cumulative collapse.

[The Market]


810
0:42:30,64 --> 0:42:33,36
You get it started with John Locke.


811
0:42:33,36 --> 0:42:36,8
And John Locke introduces property.


812
0:42:36,8 --> 0:42:40,88
He has three provisos for just private right and property.


813
0:42:40,88 --> 0:42:43,1
And the three provisos are:


814
0:42:43,1 --> 0:42:45,28
There must be enough left over for others


815
0:42:45,28 --> 0:42:47,32
and that you must not let it spoil

0:42:47,32 --> 0:42:51,8
and that you, most of all, must mix your labor with it.


817
0:42:51,8 --> 0:42:54,32
It seems justified- you mix your labor with the world


818
0:42:54,32 --> 0:42:56,48
then you are entitled to the product.


819
0:42:56,48 --> 0:42:59,28
And as long as there's enough left over for others


820
0:42:59,28 --> 0:43:1,66
and as long as it doesn't spoil


821
0:43:1,66 --> 0:43:4,8
and you don't allow anything to go to waste then that's okay.


822
0:43:4,8 --> 0:43:7,32
He spends a long time on his famous Treatises of Government


823
0:43:7,32 --> 0:43:10,24
and it's since been the canonical text


824
0:43:10,24 --> 0:43:13,62
for economic and political and legal understanding.


825
0:43:13,62 --> 0:43:16,88
It is still the classic text that's studied.


826
0:43:16,88 --> 0:43:20,12
Well, ... after he gives the provisos


827
0:43:20,12 --> 0:43:21,62
and you're almost thinking at the time


828
0:43:21,62 --> 0:43:23,52
whether you are for private property or not-


829
0:43:23,52 --> 0:43:28,0
he has given a very good and plausible and powerful defense


830
0:43:28,0 --> 0:43:29,72
of private property here-


831
0:43:29,72 --> 0:43:31,16
Well, he drops them!


832
0:43:31,16 --> 0:43:33,96
He drops them like that. Right in one sentence.


833
0:43:33,96 --> 0:43:35,96
He says, 'Well, once the introduction


834
0:43:35,96 --> 0:43:40,79
of money came in by men's tacit consent..." then it became-


835
0:43:40,79 --> 0:43:40,2
.


836
0:43:40,2 --> 0:43:43,92
and he doesn't say all the provisos are canceled or erased-


837
0:43:43,92 --> 0:43:46,12
but that's what happens.


838
0:43:46,12 --> 0:43:48,2
So, now we have not


839
0:43:48,2 --> 0:43:50,84
product and your property earned by your own labor-


840
0:43:50,84 --> 0:43:53,92
oh no- money buys labor now.


841
0:43:53,92 --> 0:43:55,44
There is no longer consideration


842
0:43:55,44 --> 0:43:57,84
whether there is enough left over for others;


843
0:43:57,84 --> 0:44:0,24
there is no longer consideration of whether it spoils-


844
0:44:0,24 --> 0:44:3,459
because he says money is like silver and gold and gold can't spoil-


845
0:44:3,459 --> 0:44:3,56
.


846
0:44:3,56 --> 0:44:7,8
and therefore money can't be responsible for waste...


847
0:44:7,8 --> 0:44:10,2
which is ridiculous. We are not talking about money and silver,


848
0:44:10,2 --> 0:44:11,92
we are talking about what its effects are.


849
0:44:11,92 --> 0:44:14,44
It's one non sequitur after another.


850
0:44:14,44 --> 0:44:17,64
Just the most startling


851
0:44:17,64 --> 0:44:21,4
logical legerdemain that he gets away with here.


852
0:44:21,4 --> 0:44:26,16
But it fits the interests of capital owners.


853
0:44:26,16 --> 0:44:28,3
Then Adam Smith comes along


854
0:44:28,3 --> 0:44:30,64
and what he adds is the religion to this...


855
0:44:30,64 --> 0:44:34,679
Locke started with 'God made it all this way- this is God's right...'


856
0:44:34,679 --> 0:44:34,8
.


857
0:44:34,8 --> 0:44:39,19
and now we get also with Smith saying 'it's not only God's...'


858
0:44:39,19 --> 0:44:39,2
.


859
0:44:39,2 --> 0:44:40,75
well, he's not actually saying this but this is


860
0:44:40,75 --> 0:44:43,48
what's happening philosophically, in principle-


861
0:44:43,48 --> 0:44:46,52
he's saying that 'it is not only a question of private property...'


862
0:44:46,52 --> 0:44:49,4
That's all now 'presupposed'- It's Given!


863
0:44:49,4 --> 0:44:51,96
And that there's 'money investors that buy labor' – Given!


864
0:44:51,96 --> 0:44:55,8
There's no limit to how much they can buy of other men's labor,


865
0:44:55,8 --> 0:44:57,44
how much they can accumulate, how much 'inequality'-


866
0:44:57,44 --> 0:44:59,42
that's all given now.


867
0:44:59,42 --> 0:45:2,72
And so he comes along and what his big idea is-


868
0:45:2,72 --> 0:45:7,52
and again it's just introduced in parentheses, in passing...


869
0:45:7,52 --> 0:45:12,5
You know, when people put out goods for sale- ... the supply-


870
0:45:12,5 --> 0:45:15,64
and other people buy them- the demand and so forth,


871
0:45:15,64 --> 0:45:21,59
how do we have supply equaling demand or demand equaling supply?


872
0:45:21,59 --> 0:45:21,16
.


873
0:45:21,16 --> 0:45:23,4
How can they come into equilibrium?


874
0:45:23,4 --> 0:45:25,88
And that is one of the central notions of economics,


875
0:45:25,88 --> 0:45:28,0
is how do they come into equilibrium.


876
0:45:28,0 --> 0:45:32,32
And he says: it's the “Invisible Hand of the Market”


877
0:45:32,32 --> 0:45:34,2
that brings them into equilibrium.


878
0:45:34,2 --> 0:45:37,12
So, now we have "God is actually imminent”.


879
0:45:37,12 --> 0:45:40,6
He just didn't give the rights to property


880
0:45:40,6 --> 0:45:45,76
and all its wherewithal and its "natural rights"


881
0:45:45,76 --> 0:45:47,28
regarding what Locke said...


882
0:45:47,28 --> 0:45:51,96
now we have the system itself AS "God".


883
0:45:51,96 --> 0:45:54,5
In fact, Smith says, when he talks


884
0:45:54,5 --> 0:45:57,5
and you'll never find this quote, and you have to read the whole of


885
0:45:57,5 --> 0:45:59,8
the Inquiry into the Wealth of Nations to find it.


886
0:45:59,8 --> 0:46:2,52
He says: 'the scantiness of subsistence


887
0:46:2,52 --> 0:46:6,84
sets limits to the reproduction of the poor


888
0:46:6,84 --> 0:46:11,8
and that nature can deal with this in no other way


889
0:46:11,8 --> 0:46:14,48
than elimination of their children.'


890
0:46:14,48 --> 0:46:19,12
So he anticipated evolutionary theory in the worst sense...


891
0:46:19,12 --> 0:46:20,88
this is well before Darwin.


892
0:46:20,88 --> 0:46:23,76
And so he called them the 'Race of Laborers'.


893
0:46:23,76 --> 0:46:27,8
So you can see: there was inherent racism built in here,


894
0:46:27,8 --> 0:46:34,779
there was an inherent life blindness to kill innumerable children.


895
0:46:34,779 --> 0:46:34,88
.


896
0:46:34,88 --> 0:46:37,96
And he thought: 'That's the Invisible Hand making supply


897
0:46:37,96 --> 0:46:40,8
meet demand and demand meet supply.'


898
0:46:40,8 --> 0:46:43,32
So, see- how wise "God" is?


899
0:46:43,32 --> 0:46:46,24
So you can see a lot of the really virulent


900
0:46:46,24 --> 0:46:50,92
life destructive, eco-genocidal things


901
0:46:50,92 --> 0:46:54,52
that are going on now have, in a way,


902
0:46:54,52 --> 0:47:0,4
a 'thought gene' back in Smith too.


903
0:47:0,4 --> 0:47:2,88
When we reflect on the original concept of


904
0:47:2,88 --> 0:47:5,44
the so-called free market capitalist system


905
0:47:5,44 --> 0:47:8,2
as initiated by early economic philosophers


906
0:47:8,2 --> 0:47:9,72
such as Adam Smith


907
0:47:9,72 --> 0:47:12,84
we see that the original intent of a “market”


908
0:47:12,84 --> 0:47:17,24
was based around real, tangible, life supporting goods for trade.


909
0:47:17,24 --> 0:47:19,72
Adam Smith never fathomed that the most


910
0:47:19,72 --> 0:47:22,16
profitable economic sector on the planet


911
0:47:22,16 --> 0:47:25,8
would eventually be in the arena of financial trading


912
0:47:25,8 --> 0:47:28,619
or so-called investment, where money itself is simply


913
0:47:28,619 --> 0:47:28,72
,


914
0:47:28,72 --> 0:47:31,899
gained by the movement of other money in an arbitrary game


915
0:47:31,899 --> 0:47:32,1
.


916
0:47:32,1 --> 0:47:35,92
which holds zero productive merit to society.


917
0:47:35,92 --> 0:47:38,16
Yet, regardless of Smith's intent


918
0:47:38,16 --> 0:47:40,88
the door for such seemingly anomalous advents


919
0:47:40,88 --> 0:47:45,76
was left wide open by one fundamental tenet of this theory:


920
0:47:45,76 --> 0:47:50,8
Money is treated as a Commodity, in and of itself.


921
0:47:50,8 --> 0:47:52,2
Today, in every economy of the world


922
0:47:52,2 --> 0:47:54,92
regardless of the social system they claim


923
0:47:54,92 --> 0:47:58,92
money is pursued for the sake of money and nothing else.


924
0:47:58,92 --> 0:48:1,96
The underlying idea, which was mysteriously qualified


925
0:48:1,96 --> 0:48:7,799
by Adam Smith with his religious declaration of the 'Invisible Hand'


926
0:48:7,799 --> 0:48:7,9
.


927
0:48:7,9 --> 0:48:10,48
is that the narrow, self-interested pursuit


928
0:48:10,48 --> 0:48:13,299
of this fictional commodity will somehow


929
0:48:13,299 --> 0:48:13,4
.


930
0:48:13,4 --> 0:48:18,56
magically manifest human and social well-being and progress.


931
0:48:18,56 --> 0:48:22,36
The reality is that the monetary incentive 'interest'


932
0:48:22,36 --> 0:48:26,8
or what some have termed the "Money Sequence of Value”


933
0:48:26,8 --> 0:48:29,28
has now completely decoupled from the foundational


934
0:48:29,28 --> 0:48:32,0
'life interest', which could be termed the


935
0:48:32,0 --> 0:48:34,56
"Life Sequence of Value".


936
0:48:34,56 --> 0:48:38,3
What has happened is that there is a complete confusion


937
0:48:38,3 --> 0:48:42,199
in economic doctrine between those two sequences.


938
0:48:42,199 --> 0:48:42,4
.


939
0:48:42,4 --> 0:48:44,88
They think that the Money Sequence of Value


940
0:48:44,88 --> 0:48:47,8
delivers the Life Sequence of Value.


941
0:48:47,8 --> 0:48:49,8
And that's why they say if more goods are sold,


942
0:48:49,8 --> 0:48:51,76
if GDPs rise and so forth...


943
0:48:51,76 --> 0:48:54,92
there would be more enhanced well-being


944
0:48:54,92 --> 0:48:58,499
and we could take the GDP as being our basic layer indicator


945
0:48:58,499 --> 0:48:58,6
.


946
0:48:58,6 --> 0:49:1,24
of social health. Well, there you see the confusion.


947
0:49:1,24 --> 0:49:3,36
It's talking about Money Sequences of Value-


948
0:49:3,36 --> 0:49:5,1
that is, all the receipts and all the revenues


949
0:49:5,1 --> 0:49:8,2
that are derived from selling goods-


950
0:49:8,2 --> 0:49:11,92
and they're confusing that with life reproduction.


951
0:49:11,92 --> 0:49:15,6
So, you have built right into this thing from the beginning


952
0:49:15,6 --> 0:49:18,52
a complete conflation of the money


953
0:49:18,52 --> 0:49:20,8
and life sequences of value. So,


954
0:49:20,8 --> 0:49:24,36
we are dealing with a kind of structured delusion


955
0:49:24,36 --> 0:49:26,6
which becomes more and more deadly


956
0:49:26,6 --> 0:49:29,32
as the money sequence decouples from producing


957
0:49:29,32 --> 0:49:33,178
anything at all. So it's a system disorder.


958
0:49:33,178 --> 0:49:33,28
.


959
0:49:33,28 --> 0:49:38,16
And the system disorder seems to be fatal.


960
0:49:38,16 --> 0:49:41,4
[Welcome to the Machine]


961
0:49:41,4 --> 0:49:44,8
In society today, you seldom hear anyone speak


962
0:49:44,8 --> 0:49:47,44
of the progress of their country or society


963
0:49:47,44 --> 0:49:51,0
in terms of their physical well-being, state of happiness,


964
0:49:51,0 --> 0:49:53,64
trust or social stability.


965
0:49:53,64 --> 0:49:55,86
Rather, the measures are presented to us


966
0:49:55,86 --> 0:49:57,92
through economic abstractions.


967
0:49:57,92 --> 0:50:1,44
We have the gross domestic product, the consumer price index,


968
0:50:1,44 --> 0:50:4,24
the value of the stock market, rates of inflation,


969
0:50:4,24 --> 0:50:5,76
and so on.


970
0:50:5,76 --> 0:50:8,24
But does this tell us anything of real value


971
0:50:8,24 --> 0:50:11,2
as to the quality of peoples' lives?


972
0:50:11,2 --> 0:50:13,58
No. All of these measures have to do with


973
0:50:13,58 --> 0:50:17,0
the money sequence itself and nothing more.


974
0:50:17,0 --> 0:50:20,18
For example, the Gross Domestic Product of a country


975
0:50:20,18 --> 0:50:23,52
is a measure of the value of goods and services sold.


976
0:50:23,52 --> 0:50:26,8
This measure is claimed to correlate to the


977
0:50:26,8 --> 0:50:29,0
“standard of living” of a country's people.


978
0:50:29,0 --> 0:50:31,35
In the United States health care accounted


979
0:50:31,35 --> 0:50:35,6
for over 17% of GDP in 2009


980
0:50:35,6 --> 0:50:38,4
amounting to over $2.5 trillion spent,


981
0:50:38,4 --> 0:50:41,94
hence creating a positive effect on this economic measure.


982
0:50:41,94 --> 0:50:45,639
And, based on this logic it would be even better for the US economy


983
0:50:45,639 --> 0:50:45,64
.


984
0:50:45,64 --> 0:50:48,2
if health care services increased more so...


985
0:50:48,2 --> 0:50:51,0
perhaps to $3 trillion or 5 trillion,


986
0:50:51,0 --> 0:50:53,6
since that would create more growth,


987
0:50:53,6 --> 0:50:55,78
more jobs and hence boasted by economists


988
0:50:55,78 --> 0:50:59,4
as a rise in their country's standard of living.


989
0:50:59,4 --> 0:51:0,92
But- ... wait a minute.


990
0:51:0,92 --> 0:51:4,12
What do health care services actually represent?


991
0:51:4,12 --> 0:51:7,44
Well, SICK AND DYING PEOPLE.


992
0:51:7,44 --> 0:51:11,1
That's right: the more unhealthy people there are in America


993
0:51:11,1 --> 0:51:13,33
the better the economy.


994
0:51:13,33 --> 0:51:17,2
Now, that is not an exaggeration or a cynical perspective.


995
0:51:17,2 --> 0:51:21,119
In fact, if we step back far enough you will realize that the GDP


996
0:51:21,119 --> 0:51:21,12
.


997
0:51:21,12 --> 0:51:24,4
not only doesn't reflect real public or social health


998
0:51:24,4 --> 0:51:25,94
on any tangible level,


999
0:51:25,94 --> 0:51:28,2
it is, in fact, mostly a measure


1000
0:51:28,2 --> 0:51:32,319
of industrial inefficiency and social degradation.


1001
0:51:32,319 --> 0:51:32,32
.


1002
0:51:32,32 --> 0:51:35,94
And the more you see it rise, the worse things are becoming


1003
0:51:35,94 --> 0:51:38,36
with respect to personal, social


1004
0:51:38,36 --> 0:51:40,9
and environmental integrity.


1005
0:51:40,9 --> 0:51:44,8
You have to create problems to create profit.


1006
0:51:44,8 --> 0:51:47,96
There is no profit under the current paradigm


1007
0:51:47,96 --> 0:51:50,86
in saving lives, putting balance on this planet,


1008
0:51:50,86 --> 0:51:53,3
having justice and peace or anything else.


1009
0:51:53,3 --> 0:51:56,44
There is just no profit there.


1010
0:51:56,44 --> 0:52:0,39
There's an old saying: 'Pass a law and create a business.'


1011
0:52:0,39 --> 0:52:0,4
.


1012
0:52:0,4 --> 0:52:2,66
Whether you are creating a business for a lawyer or whatever.


1013
0:52:2,66 --> 0:52:5,52
So, crime does create business


1014
0:52:5,52 --> 0:52:8,879
just like destruction creates business in Haiti.


1015
0:52:8,879 --> 0:52:8,88
.


1016
0:52:8,88 --> 0:52:12,8
We have now roughly 2 million people incarcerated


1017
0:52:12,8 --> 0:52:13,52
in this country (USA)


1018
0:52:13,52 --> 0:52:17,199
and of those many are in prisons run by private corporations:


1019
0:52:17,199 --> 0:52:17,2
.


1020
0:52:17,2 --> 0:52:19,4
Corrections Corporation of America, Wackenhut,


1021
0:52:19,4 --> 0:52:21,16
who trade their stock on Wall Street


1022
0:52:21,16 --> 0:52:24,12
based upon how many people are in jail.


1023
0:52:24,12 --> 0:52:26,14
Now that's sickness!


1024
0:52:26,14 --> 0:52:28,26
But that is a reflection


1025
0:52:28,26 --> 0:52:32,0
of what this economic paradigm calls for.


1026
0:52:32,0 --> 0:52:35,84
So what exactly does this economic paradigm call for?


1027
0:52:35,84 --> 0:52:39,28
What is it that keeps our economic system going?


1028
0:52:39,28 --> 0:52:40,86
Consumption.


1029
0:52:40,86 --> 0:52:44,28
Or more accurately- Cyclical Consumption.


1030
0:52:44,28 --> 0:52:47,799
When we break down the foundation of classic market economics


1031
0:52:47,799 --> 0:52:47,8
.


1032
0:52:47,8 --> 0:52:50,5
we are left with a pattern of monetary exchange


1033
0:52:50,5 --> 0:52:52,7
that simply cannot be allowed to stop


1034
0:52:52,7 --> 0:52:54,68
or even substantially slowed


1035
0:52:54,68 --> 0:52:58,359
if the society as we know it is to remain operational.


1036
0:52:58,359 --> 0:52:58,36
.


1037
0:52:58,36 --> 0:53:1,3
There are three main actors on the economic stage:


1038
0:53:1,3 --> 0:53:4,559
the employee, the employer and the consumer.


1039
0:53:4,559 --> 0:53:4,56
.


1040
0:53:4,56 --> 0:53:8,2
The employee sells labor to the employer for income.


1041
0:53:8,2 --> 0:53:11,1
The employer sells its production services and hence goods,


1042
0:53:11,1 --> 0:53:13,1
to the consumer for income.


1043
0:53:13,1 --> 0:53:15,66
And the consumer, of course, is simply another role


1044
0:53:15,66 --> 0:53:17,9
of the employer and employee,


1045
0:53:17,9 --> 0:53:19,84
spending back into the system


1046
0:53:19,84 --> 0:53:22,88
to enable the cyclical consumption to continue.


1047
0:53:22,88 --> 0:53:25,3
In other words, the global market system is based


1048
0:53:25,3 --> 0:53:27,6
on the assumption that there will always be enough


1049
0:53:27,6 --> 0:53:31,599
product demand in a society to move enough money around


1050
0:53:31,599 --> 0:53:31,6
.


1051
0:53:31,6 --> 0:53:35,17
at a rate which can keep the consumption process going.


1052
0:53:35,17 --> 0:53:36,93
And the faster the rate of consumption


1053
0:53:36,93 --> 0:53:39,54
the more so-called economic growth is assumed


1054
0:53:39,54 --> 0:53:42,12
and so the machine goes...


1055
0:53:42,12 --> 0:53:43,96
But, hold on-


1056
0:53:43,96 --> 0:53:46,84
I thought an economy was meant to, I don't know...


1057
0:53:46,84 --> 0:53:48,57
“Economize”?


1058
0:53:48,57 --> 0:53:51,3
Doesn't the very term have to do with preservation


1059
0:53:51,3 --> 0:53:54,8
and efficiency and a reduction of waste?


1060
0:53:54,8 --> 0:53:58,26
So how does our system, which demands consumption


1061
0:53:58,26 --> 0:54:0,78
and the more the better, efficiently preserve


1062
0:54:0,78 --> 0:54:3,0
or “Economize” at all?


1063
0:54:3,0 --> 0:54:5,12
Well... it doesn't.


1064
0:54:5,12 --> 0:54:8,98
The intent of the market system is, in fact, the exact opposite


1065
0:54:8,98 --> 0:54:11,39
of what a real economy is supposed to do,


1066
0:54:11,39 --> 0:54:13,46
which is efficiently and conservatively


1067
0:54:13,46 --> 0:54:15,9
orient the materials for production and distribution


1068
0:54:15,9 --> 0:54:18,24
of life supporting goods.


1069
0:54:18,24 --> 0:54:21,18
We live on a finite planet, with finite resources


1070
0:54:21,18 --> 0:54:23,3
where, for example, the oil we utilize


1071
0:54:23,3 --> 0:54:25,5
took millions of years to develop...


1072
0:54:25,5 --> 0:54:29,6
where the minerals we use took billions of years to develop.


1073
0:54:29,6 --> 0:54:33,0
So...having a system that deliberately promotes


1074
0:54:33,0 --> 0:54:35,8
the acceleration of consumption


1075
0:54:35,8 --> 0:54:38,28
for the sake of so-called “economic growth”


1076
0:54:38,28 --> 0:54:42,2
is pure ecocidal insanity.


1077
0:54:42,2 --> 0:54:45,2
Absence of waste, that's what efficiency is.


1078
0:54:45,2 --> 0:54:47,8
Absence of waste?


1079
0:54:47,8 --> 0:54:50,5
This system is more wasteful than all the other


1080
0:54:50,5 --> 0:54:52,86
existing systems in the history of the planet.


1081
0:54:52,86 --> 0:54:55,94
Every level of life organization and life system


1082
0:54:55,94 --> 0:54:58,22
is in a state of crisis and challenge


1083
0:54:58,22 --> 0:55:0,5
and decay or collapse.


1084
0:55:0,5 --> 0:55:3,58
No peer-reviewed journal in the last 30 years


1085
0:55:3,58 --> 0:55:5,76
will tell you anything different:


1086
0:55:5,76 --> 0:55:9,24
that is that every life system is in decline


1087
0:55:9,24 --> 0:55:13,279
as well as social programs... as well as our water access.


1088
0:55:13,279 --> 0:55:13,28
.


1089
0:55:13,28 --> 0:55:17,399
Try to name any means of life that isn't threatened and endangered.


1090
0:55:17,399 --> 0:55:17,4
.


1091
0:55:17,4 --> 0:55:19,2
You can't.


1092
0:55:19,2 --> 0:55:21,88
There really isn't one and that's very, very despairing.


1093
0:55:21,88 --> 0:55:24,9
But we haven't even figured out the causal mechanism.


1094
0:55:24,9 --> 0:55:26,89
We don't want to face the causal mechanism.


1095
0:55:26,89 --> 0:55:29,94
We just want to go on. You know that's where insanity is


1096
0:55:29,94 --> 0:55:32,47
where you keep doing the same thing over and over again


1097
0:55:32,47 --> 0:55:35,0
even though it clearly doesn't work.


1098
0:55:35,0 --> 0:55:37,5
So you're really


1099
0:55:37,5 --> 0:55:39,74
dealing with not an economic system


1100
0:55:39,74 --> 0:55:44,96
but I would go so far as to say an anti-economic system.


1101
0:55:44,96 --> 0:55:47,4
[The Anti-Economy]


1102
0:55:47,4 --> 0:55:51,439
There is an old saying that the competitive market model seeks to


1103
0:55:51,439 --> 0:55:51,44
.


1104
0:55:51,44 --> 0:55:55,68
“create the best possible goods at the lowest possible prices”.


1105
0:55:55,68 --> 0:55:58,56
This statement is essentially the incentive concept


1106
0:55:58,56 --> 0:56:2,189
which justifies market competition, based on the assumption


1107
0:56:2,189 --> 0:56:2,19
.


1108
0:56:2,19 --> 0:56:6,16
that the result is the production of higher quality goods.


1109
0:56:6,16 --> 0:56:9,6
If I was going to build myself a table from scratch


1110
0:56:9,6 --> 0:56:11,3
I would naturally build it out of the best


1111
0:56:11,3 --> 0:56:13,58
most durable materials possible, right?


1112
0:56:13,58 --> 0:56:16,56
With the intent for it to last as long as possible.


1113
0:56:16,56 --> 0:56:18,7
Why would I want to make something poor


1114
0:56:18,7 --> 0:56:20,96
knowing I would have to eventually do it again


1115
0:56:20,96 --> 0:56:24,56
and expend more materials and more energy?


1116
0:56:24,56 --> 0:56:28,4
Well, as rational as that may seem in the physical world,


1117
0:56:28,4 --> 0:56:29,98
when it comes to the market world


1118
0:56:29,98 --> 0:56:32,44
it is not only explicitly irrational


1119
0:56:32,44 --> 0:56:34,4
it is not even an option.


1120
0:56:34,4 --> 0:56:37,679
It is technically impossible to produce the best of anything


1121
0:56:37,679 --> 0:56:37,68
.


1122
0:56:37,68 --> 0:56:40,62
if a company is to maintain a competitive edge


1123
0:56:40,62 --> 0:56:43,24
and hence remain affordable to the consumer.


1124
0:56:43,24 --> 0:56:45,93
Literally everything created and set for sale


1125
0:56:45,93 --> 0:56:48,98
in the global economy is immediately inferior


1126
0:56:48,98 --> 0:56:50,74
the moment it is produced,


1127
0:56:50,74 --> 0:56:53,48
for it is a mathematical impossibility


1128
0:56:53,48 --> 0:56:55,75
to make the most scientifically advanced


1129
0:56:55,75 --> 0:56:59,12
efficient and strategically sustainable products.


1130
0:56:59,12 --> 0:57:1,39
This is due to the fact that the market system


1131
0:57:1,39 --> 0:57:3,9
requires that “cost efficiency”


1132
0:57:3,9 --> 0:57:5,88
or the need to reduce expenses


1133
0:57:5,88 --> 0:57:8,28
exists at every stage of production.


1134
0:57:8,28 --> 0:57:10,27
From the cost of labor, to the cost of


1135
0:57:10,27 --> 0:57:12,96
materials and packaging and so on.


1136
0:57:12,96 --> 0:57:15,32
This competitive strategy, of course,


1137
0:57:15,32 --> 0:57:18,34
is to make sure the public buys their goods


1138
0:57:18,34 --> 0:57:20,6
rather than from a competing producer


1139
0:57:20,6 --> 0:57:22,8
...which is doing the exact same thing


1140
0:57:22,8 --> 0:57:27,0
to also make their goods both competitive and affordable.


1141
0:57:27,0 --> 0:57:30,32
This immutably wasteful consequence of the system


1142
0:57:30,32 --> 0:57:34,12
could be termed "Intrinsic Obsolescence".


1143
0:57:34,12 --> 0:57:37,6
However, this is only one part of a larger problem.


1144
0:57:37,6 --> 0:57:40,64
A fundamental governing principle of market economics,


1145
0:57:40,64 --> 0:57:45,159
one you will not find in any textbook by the way, is the following:


1146
0:57:45,159 --> 0:57:45,16
.


1147
0:57:45,16 --> 0:57:49,2
“Nothing produced can be allowed to maintain a lifespan longer


1148
0:57:49,2 --> 0:57:53,759
than what can be endured in order to continue cyclical consumption.”


1149
0:57:53,759 --> 0:57:53,76
.


1150
0:57:53,76 --> 0:57:56,88
In other words, it is critical that stuff break down,


1151
0:57:56,88 --> 0:58:0,64
fail and expire within a certain amount of time.


1152
0:58:0,64 --> 0:58:4,0
This is termed - “Planned obsolescence”.


1153
0:58:4,0 --> 0:58:7,75
Planned obsolescence is the backbone of the underlying market strategy


1154
0:58:7,75 --> 0:58:11,2
of every goods producing corporation in existence.


1155
0:58:11,2 --> 0:58:14,879
While very few, of course would admit to such a strategy outright


1156
0:58:14,879 --> 0:58:14,88
.


1157
0:58:14,88 --> 0:58:16,72
what they do is mask it within the


1158
0:58:16,72 --> 0:58:20,29
Intrinsic Obsolescence phenomenon just discussed,


1159
0:58:20,29 --> 0:58:24,559
while often ignoring, or even suppressing new advents in technology


1160
0:58:24,559 --> 0:58:24,58
.


1161
0:58:24,58 --> 0:58:28,59
which might create a more sustainable, durable good.


1162
0:58:28,59 --> 0:58:30,76
So, if it wasn't wasteful enough


1163
0:58:30,76 --> 0:58:33,1
that the system inherently cannot allow


1164
0:58:33,1 --> 0:58:36,4
the most durable and efficient goods to be produced,


1165
0:58:36,4 --> 0:58:39,2
Planned Obsolescence deliberately recognizes


1166
0:58:39,2 --> 0:58:41,54
that the longer any good is in operation


1167
0:58:41,54 --> 0:58:44,82
the worse it is for sustaining cyclical consumption


1168
0:58:44,82 --> 0:58:47,68
and hence the market system itself.


1169
0:58:47,68 --> 0:58:50,26
In other words, product sustainability


1170
0:58:50,26 --> 0:58:53,72
is actually inverse to economic growth


1171
0:58:53,72 --> 0:58:57,16
and hence there is a direct, reinforced incentive


1172
0:58:57,16 --> 0:59:1,679
to make sure life spans are short of any given good produced.


1173
0:59:1,679 --> 0:59:1,68
.


1174
0:59:1,68 --> 0:59:6,24
And, in fact, the system cannot operate any other way.


1175
0:59:6,24 --> 0:59:10,14
One glance at the sea of landfills now spreading across the world


1176
0:59:10,14 --> 0:59:12,6
show the obsolescence reality.


1177
0:59:12,6 --> 0:59:15,28
There are now billions of cheaply made cell phones,


1178
0:59:15,28 --> 0:59:17,25
computers and other technology


1179
0:59:17,25 --> 0:59:20,25
each full of precious, difficult to mine materials


1180
0:59:20,25 --> 0:59:22,62
such as gold, coltan, copper,


1181
0:59:22,62 --> 0:59:24,68
now rotting in vast piles


1182
0:59:24,68 --> 0:59:27,6
usually due to the mere malfunction or obsolescence


1183
0:59:27,6 --> 0:59:31,36
of small parts which, in a conservative society


1184
0:59:31,36 --> 0:59:35,679
could likely be fixed or updated and the life of the good extended.


1185
0:59:35,679 --> 0:59:35,68
.


1186
0:59:35,68 --> 0:59:39,9
Unfortunately, as efficient as that may seem in our physical reality


1187
0:59:39,9 --> 0:59:43,79
living on a finite planet with finite resources,


1188
0:59:43,79 --> 0:59:43,8
.


1189
0:59:43,8 --> 0:59:48,0
it is explicitly inefficient with respect to the market.


1190
0:59:48,0 --> 0:59:49,54
To put it into a phrase:


1191
0:59:49,54 --> 0:59:52,71
“Efficiency, Sustainability, and Preservation


1192
0:59:52,71 --> 0:59:56,28
are the enemies of our economic system.”


1193
0:59:56,28 --> 0:59:59,8
Likewise, just as physical goods need to be constantly produced


1194
0:59:59,8 --> 1:0:3,559
and reproduced regardless of their environmental impact,


1195
1:0:3,559 --> 1:0:3,56
.


1196
1:0:3,56 --> 1:0:7,54
the service industry operates with an equal rationale.


1197
1:0:7,54 --> 1:0:10,24
The fact is, there is no monetary benefit


1198
1:0:10,24 --> 1:0:12,56
to resolving any problems


1199
1:0:12,56 --> 1:0:14,68
which are currently being serviced.


1200
1:0:14,68 --> 1:0:16,0
At the end of the day


1201
1:0:16,0 --> 1:0:19,4
the last thing the medical establishment really wants


1202
1:0:19,4 --> 1:0:22,4
is the curing of diseases such as cancer,


1203
1:0:22,4 --> 1:0:27,16
which would eliminate countless jobs and trillions in revenue.


1204
1:0:27,16 --> 1:0:28,76
And since we are on the subject,


1205
1:0:28,76 --> 1:0:32,32
crime and terrorism in this system are good!


1206
1:0:32,32 --> 1:0:34,32
Well, at least economically.


1207
1:0:34,32 --> 1:0:36,4
For it is employing police,


1208
1:0:36,4 --> 1:0:38,84
generating high-value commodities for security,


1209
1:0:38,84 --> 1:0:40,76
not to mention the value of prisons


1210
1:0:40,76 --> 1:0:43,92
that are privately owned- for profit.


1211
1:0:43,92 --> 1:0:45,52
And how about war?


1212
1:0:45,52 --> 1:0:49,44
The war industry in America is a huge driver of GDP-


1213
1:0:49,44 --> 1:0:51,84
one of the most profitable industries-


1214
1:0:51,84 --> 1:0:55,24
producing weapons of death and destruction.


1215
1:0:55,24 --> 1:0:58,44
The favorite game of this industry is to blow things up


1216
1:0:58,44 --> 1:1:1,8
and then go and rebuild them! For profit.


1217
1:1:1,8 --> 1:1:4,411
We saw this with the windfall billion dollar contracts


1218
1:1:4,411 --> 1:1:6,84
made from the Iraq war.


1219
1:1:6,84 --> 1:1:10,719
The bottom line is that socially negative attributes of society


1220
1:1:10,719 --> 1:1:10,76
.


1221
1:1:10,76 --> 1:1:14,16
have become positively rewarded ventures for industry.


1222
1:1:14,16 --> 1:1:16,96
And any interest in problem resolution


1223
1:1:16,96 --> 1:1:20,4
or environmental sustainability and conservation


1224
1:1:20,4 --> 1:1:25,6
is intrinsically counter to economic sustainability.


1225
1:1:25,6 --> 1:1:27,28
And this is why


1226
1:1:27,28 --> 1:1:30,64
every time you see the GDP rise in any country


1227
1:1:30,64 --> 1:1:33,4
you are witnessing an increase in necessity


1228
1:1:33,4 --> 1:1:35,44
whether real or contrived.


1229
1:1:35,44 --> 1:1:39,4
And by definition, a necessity is rooted in inefficiency.


1230
1:1:39,4 --> 1:1:44,84
Hence, increased necessity means increased inefficiency.


1231
1:1:44,84 --> 1:1:47,6
[ Value System Disorder ]


1232
1:1:47,6 --> 1:1:50,879
The American dream is based on rampant consumerism.


1233
1:1:50,879 --> 1:1:50,88
.


1234
1:1:50,88 --> 1:1:53,24
It is based upon the fact that


1235
1:1:53,24 --> 1:1:54,65
mainstream media and


1236
1:1:54,65 --> 1:1:57,1
especially commercial advertising-


1237
1:1:57,1 --> 1:2:0,8
all corporations who need this infinite growth-


1238
1:2:0,8 --> 1:2:2,74
have convinced us or brainwashed


1239
1:2:2,74 --> 1:2:6,0
most people in America and hence the world


1240
1:2:6,0 --> 1:2:8,96
that we have to have X number of material possessions


1241
1:2:8,96 --> 1:2:11,36
and the possibility of gaining infinitely more


1242
1:2:11,36 --> 1:2:14,4
material possessions, in order to be happy.


1243
1:2:14,4 --> 1:2:15,76
That's just not true.


1244
1:2:15,76 --> 1:2:19,6
So why do people continue to buy in this way


1245
1:2:19,6 --> 1:2:22,4
which is ultimately eco-genocidal


1246
1:2:22,4 --> 1:2:24,92
in its systemic effects cumulatively?


1247
1:2:24,92 --> 1:2:27,8
And it just is classical operand conditioning.


1248
1:2:27,8 --> 1:2:32,2
You simply put inputs of conditioning into the organism


1249
1:2:32,2 --> 1:2:35,68
and you have outputs of desired behaviors


1250
1:2:35,68 --> 1:2:38,4
or goals or objectives.


1251
1:2:38,4 --> 1:2:41,28
And it has all the resources of technology.


1252
1:2:41,28 --> 1:2:44,319
And they boast about how they get into the minds of infants;


1253
1:2:44,319 --> 1:2:44,32
.


1254
1:2:44,32 --> 1:2:47,48
what they hear is already making them


1255
1:2:47,48 --> 1:2:49,36
conditioned to the brand.


1256
1:2:49,36 --> 1:2:53,66
Then you see, that's how people have been such fools.


1257
1:2:53,66 --> 1:2:53,661
.


1258
1:2:53,661 --> 1:2:55,28
In a way, they have been taught to be fools.


1259
1:2:55,28 --> 1:2:59,28
It's a value system disorder.


1260
1:2:59,28 --> 1:3:1,1
You know, if there is any testament


1261
1:3:1,1 --> 1:3:3,48
to the plasticity of the human mind;


1262
1:3:3,48 --> 1:3:5,56
if there is any proof to how malleable


1263
1:3:5,56 --> 1:3:8,27
human thought is and how easily conditioned


1264
1:3:8,27 --> 1:3:10,14
and guided people can become


1265
1:3:10,14 --> 1:3:12,68
based on the nature of their environmental stimulus


1266
1:3:12,68 --> 1:3:14,68
and what it reinforces:


1267
1:3:14,68 --> 1:3:18,4
the world of commercial advertising is the proof.


1268
1:3:18,4 --> 1:3:21,12
You have to stand in awe


1269
1:3:21,12 --> 1:3:23,52
at the level of brainwashing


1270
1:3:23,52 --> 1:3:27,56
where these programmed robots known as "consumers"


1271
1:3:27,56 --> 1:3:29,36
wander the landscape


1272
1:3:29,36 --> 1:3:32,76
only to walk into a store and spend, say-


1273
1:3:32,76 --> 1:3:35,56
$4000 on a handbag


1274
1:3:35,56 --> 1:3:37,88
that likely cost $10 to make


1275
1:3:37,88 --> 1:3:40,4
in a sweatshop overseas.


1276
1:3:40,4 --> 1:3:44,4
Only for the brand status it supposedly represents


1277
1:3:44,4 --> 1:3:45,8
in the culture.


1278
1:3:45,8 --> 1:3:48,48
Or perhaps the ancient communal traditions


1279
1:3:48,48 --> 1:3:52,4
which increase trust and cohesiveness in society-


1280
1:3:52,4 --> 1:3:53,66
which have now been hijacked


1281
1:3:53,66 --> 1:3:57,36
by acquisitive, materialistic values where now annually


1282
1:3:57,36 --> 1:4:1,24
we exchange useless crap a few times a year.


1283
1:4:1,24 --> 1:4:3,46
And we might wonder why so many today


1284
1:4:3,46 --> 1:4:6,8
have a compulsion to shopping and acquisition,


1285
1:4:6,8 --> 1:4:9,28
when it is clear that they have been conditioned from childhood


1286
1:4:9,28 --> 1:4:11,16
to expect material goods


1287
1:4:11,16 --> 1:4:15,8
as a sign of their status with friends and family.


1288
1:4:15,8 --> 1:4:18,0
The fact is, the foundation of any society


1289
1:4:18,0 --> 1:4:20,32
are the values that support its operation.


1290
1:4:20,32 --> 1:4:22,76
And our society, as it exists


1291
1:4:22,76 --> 1:4:25,44
can only operate if our values support


1292
1:4:25,44 --> 1:4:27,1
the conspicuous consumption


1293
1:4:27,1 --> 1:4:31,4
it requires to continue the market system.


1294
1:4:31,4 --> 1:4:34,44
75 years ago consumption in America


1295
1:4:34,44 --> 1:4:36,56
and much of the first world was half


1296
1:4:36,56 --> 1:4:38,6
of what we see today, per person.


1297
1:4:38,6 --> 1:4:40,72
Today's new consumer culture


1298
1:4:40,72 --> 1:4:43,16
has been manufactured and imposed


1299
1:4:43,16 --> 1:4:45,25
due to the very real need


1300
1:4:45,25 --> 1:4:48,44
for higher and higher levels of consumption.


1301
1:4:48,44 --> 1:4:51,52
And this is why most corporations now spend


1302
1:4:51,52 --> 1:4:53,9
more money on advertising


1303
1:4:53,9 --> 1:4:57,24
than the actual process of product creation itself.


1304
1:4:57,24 --> 1:5:1,52
They work diligently to create a false need for you to fill.


1305
1:5:1,52 --> 1:5:5,4
And it happens to work.


1306
1:5:5,4 --> 1:5:7,72
[ The “Economists” ]


1307
1:5:7,72 --> 1:5:11,64
You know economists, in fact, are not economists at all.


1308
1:5:11,64 --> 1:5:14,1
They're propagandists of money value.


1309
1:5:14,1 --> 1:5:16,75
And you will find that all of their models basically


1310
1:5:16,75 --> 1:5:21,639
get down to token exchanges that are true to profit


1311
1:5:21,639 --> 1:5:21,64
.


1312
1:5:21,64 --> 1:5:23,92
of one side or both sides or whatever.


1313
1:5:23,92 --> 1:5:26,28
But they are completely disconnected from the actually


1314
1:5:26,28 --> 1:5:28,44
existing world of reproduction.


1315
1:5:28,44 --> 1:5:32,8
In Ohio, an old man failed to pay his electric bill;


1316
1:5:32,8 --> 1:5:34,83
you may be familiar with the case.


1317
1:5:34,83 --> 1:5:38,22
And the electric company turned off the electricity and he died.


1318
1:5:38,22 --> 1:5:39,99
The reason they turned it off was because


1319
1:5:39,99 --> 1:5:41,701
it wouldn't have been profitable for them


1320
1:5:41,701 --> 1:5:44,44
to keep it on because he didn't pay his bill.


1321
1:5:44,44 --> 1:5:46,24
Do you believe that was right?


1322
1:5:46,24 --> 1:5:48,22
The responsibility really lies not on


1323
1:5:48,22 --> 1:5:50,53
the electric company for turning it off


1324
1:5:50,53 --> 1:5:55,239
but on those of this man's neighbors and friends and associates

1:5:55,239 --> 1:5:55,24
.

1:5:55,24 --> 1:5:58,839

Did I hear that right?


1331
1:6:4,28 --> 1:6:7,719
Did he just say the death of a man caused by not having money


1332
1:6:7,719 --> 1:6:7,72
.


1333
1:6:7,72 --> 1:6:9,44
was the responsibility of...


1334
1:6:9,44 --> 1:6:11,28
other people...


1335
1:6:11,28 --> 1:6:13,68
or, in effect, charity?


1336
1:6:13,68 --> 1:6:17,15
Well then, I guess we're gonna need a whole lot of infomercials,


1337
1:6:17,15 --> 1:6:21,649
little miserable coin slot donations for bodega counters

it exists as a never ending, self-referring


1353
1:6:56,1 --> 1:6:59,35
self-rationalizing circle of discourse


1354
1:6:59,35 --> 1:7:3,32
where universal human need, natural resources


1355
1:7:3,32 --> 1:7:6,75
and any form of physical life supporting efficiency


1356
1:7:6,75 --> 1:7:8,9
is ruled out by default,


1357
1:7:8,9 --> 1:7:11,7
and replaced by the singular notion that humans


1358
1:7:11,7 --> 1:7:14,34
seeking advantage over each other for money alone,


1359
1:7:14,34 --> 1:7:17,4
motivated by their own, narrow self-interest,


1360
1:7:17,4 --> 1:7:22,16
will magically create a sustainable, healthy, balanced society.


1361
1:7:22,16 --> 1:7:26,509
There is no life coordinate in this whole theory, this whole doctrine.


1362
1:7:26,509 --> 1:7:26,51
.


1363
1:7:26,51 --> 1:7:29,9
What are they doing? What are they doing??


1364
1:7:29,9 --> 1:7:32,12
What they are doing is tracking the money sequences.


1365
1:7:32,12 --> 1:7:35,32
That's all it is, is tracking money sequences


1366
1:7:35,32 --> 1:7:38,67
presupposing everything that matters:


1367
1:7:38,67 --> 1:7:41,28
One: There is no life coordinates...


1368
1:7:41,28 --> 1:7:43,48
Whoa- ... no life coordinates!


1369
1:7:43,48 --> 1:7:49,39
Two: That all the agents are self-maximizing preferences seekers.


1370
1:7:49,39 --> 1:7:49,4
.


1371
1:7:49,4 --> 1:7:51,5
That is, they think of nothing other than themselves


1372
1:7:51,5 --> 1:7:53,36
and what they can get most for themselves.


1373
1:7:53,36 --> 1:7:59,2
That's the ruling notion of rationality: self-maximizing choice.


1374
1:7:59,2 --> 1:7:59,3
.


1375
1:7:59,3 --> 1:8:2,99
And the only thing that they are interested in self-maximizing


1376
1:8:2,99 --> 1:8:5,32
is money or commodities.


1377
1:8:5,32 --> 1:8:7,75
Well, where does social relations come in?


1378
1:8:7,75 --> 1:8:11,18
It doesn't, except in the exchange to self-maximize.


1379
1:8:11,18 --> 1:8:13,8
Where do our natural resources come in?


1380
1:8:13,8 --> 1:8:16,9
They don't, except to exploit.


1381
1:8:16,9 --> 1:8:21,86
Where does the family come in as being able to survive?


1382
1:8:21,86 --> 1:8:26,759
It doesn't. They have to have money in order to purchase any good.


1383
1:8:26,759 --> 1:8:26,76
.


1384
1:8:26,76 --> 1:8:29,959
Well, shouldn't an economy deal somewhere with human need?


1385
1:8:29,959 --> 1:8:29,96
.


1386
1:8:29,96 --> 1:8:35,199

1387
1:8:35,199 --> 1:8:35,2

1388
1:8:35,2 --> 1:8:38,4
Oh, "need" isn't even in your lexicon.


1389
1:8:38,4 --> 1:8:41,44
You dissolve it into "wants".


1390
1:8:41,44 --> 1:8:45,799
And what is a want? That means money demand that wants to buy.


1391
1:8:45,799 --> 1:8:45,8
.


1392
1:8:45,8 --> 1:8:48,4
Well, if it's money demand that wants to buy


1393
1:8:48,4 --> 1:8:49,995
it has nothing to do with need


1394
1:8:49,995 --> 1:8:52,16
because maybe the person has no money demand


1395
1:8:52,16 --> 1:8:55,2
and desperately needs, say, water supply.


1396
1:8:55,2 --> 1:8:59,0
Or, it may be money demand wants a gold toilet seat.


1397
1:8:59,0 --> 1:9:2,239
Well, where does it all go? To the gold toilet seat.


1398
1:9:2,239 --> 1:9:2,24

1399
1:9:2,24 --> 1:9:5,0
And you call this economics?


1400
1:9:5,0 --> 1:9:9,719
Really, when one thinks of it, it's got to be the most bizarre


1401
1:9:9,719 --> 1:9:10,0

1404
1:9:16,28 --> 1:9:20,4
Now- so far we have focused on the market system.


1405
1:9:20,4 --> 1:9:24,919
But this system is actually only half of the global economic paradigm.


1406
1:9:24,919 --> 1:9:24,92
.


1407
1:9:24,92 --> 1:9:28,2
The other half is the “Monetary System”.


1408
1:9:28,2 --> 1:9:31,41
While the Market System deals with the interaction of people

1411
1:9:36,44 --> 1:9:39,94
the Monetary System is an underlying set of policies

1:9:39,94 --> 1:9:41,98
set by financial institutions


1413
1:9:41,98 --> 1:9:46,79
which create conditions for the market system, among other things.


1414
1:9:46,79 --> 1:9:46,8

And while you might want to pull your hair out listening


1419
1:9:57,1 --> 1:10:0,1

1:10:0,1 --> 1:10:4,12
"Modest preemptive actions, can obviate the need

1:10:4,12 --> 1:10:7,96
of more drastic actions, at a later date."


1422
1:10:7,96 --> 1:10:10,12
... the nature and effect of this system


1423
1:10:10,12 --> 1:10:12,52
is actually quite simple:


1424
1:10:12,52 --> 1:10:16,301
Our economy has- or the global economy has-


1425
1:10:16,301 --> 1:10:16,4
.


1426
1:10:16,4 --> 1:10:19,399
three basic things that govern it. One is fractional reserve banking:


1427
1:10:19,399 --> 1:10:19,5
.


1428
1:10:19,5 --> 1:10:21,88
the banks printing money out of nothing.


1429
1:10:21,88 --> 1:10:24,12
[2nd] It's also based upon compound interest.


1430
1:10:24,12 --> 1:10:27,43
When you borrow money, you have to pay back more


1431
1:10:27,43 --> 1:10:30,3
than you borrowed which means that you, in effect,


1432
1:10:30,3 --> 1:10:33,0
create money out of thin air,


1433
1:10:33,0 --> 1:10:36,76
again which has to be serviced by creating still more money.


1434
1:10:36,76 --> 1:10:39,0
[3rd] We live in an infinite growth paradigm.


1435
1:10:39,0 --> 1:10:43,4
The economic paradigm we live in now is a Ponzi scheme.


1436
1:10:43,4 --> 1:10:46,699
Nothing grows forever. It's not possible.


1437
1:10:46,699 --> 1:10:46,8
.


1438
1:10:46,8 --> 1:10:49,5
As a great psychologist James Hillman wrote:


1439
1:10:49,5 --> 1:10:51,2
“The only thing that grows in the human body


1440
1:10:51,2 --> 1:10:53,56
after a certain age is cancer.”


1441
1:10:53,56 --> 1:10:56,18
It's not just the amount of money that has to keep growing


1442
1:10:56,18 --> 1:10:58,4
it's the amount of consumers. Consumers to


1443
1:10:58,4 --> 1:11:1,599
borrow money at interest to generate more money and obviously,


1444
1:11:1,599 --> 1:11:1,7
.


1445
1:11:1,7 --> 1:11:4,64
that's not possible on a finite planet.


1446
1:11:4,64 --> 1:11:8,4
People are basically vehicles to just create money,


1447
1:11:8,4 --> 1:11:10,32
which must create more money


1448
1:11:10,32 --> 1:11:12,2
to keep the whole thing from falling apart,


1449
1:11:12,2 --> 1:11:15,2
which is what's happening right now.


1450
1:11:15,2 --> 1:11:17,88
There are really only two things anyone needs to know


1451
1:11:17,88 --> 1:11:20,24
about the monetary system:


1452
1:11:20,24 --> 1:11:23,48
1: All money is created out of debt.


1453
1:11:23,48 --> 1:11:25,72
Money is monetized debt


1454
1:11:25,72 --> 1:11:28,24
whether it materialized from treasury bonds,


1455
1:11:28,24 --> 1:11:31,12
home loan contracts or credit cards.


1456
1:11:31,12 --> 1:11:33,38
In other words, if all outstanding debt


1457
1:11:33,38 --> 1:11:35,28
was to be repaid right now


1458
1:11:35,28 --> 1:11:38,64
there would not be one dollar in circulation.


1459
1:11:38,64 --> 1:11:43,72
And 2: Interest is charged on virtually all loans made,


1460
1:11:43,72 --> 1:11:46,24
and the money needed to pay back this interest


1461
1:11:46,24 --> 1:11:49,4
does not exist in the money supply outright.


1462
1:11:49,4 --> 1:11:52,12
Only the principal is created by the loans


1463
1:11:52,12 --> 1:11:54,8
and the principal is the money supply.


1464
1:11:54,8 --> 1:11:57,68
So, if all this debt was to be repaid right now,


1465
1:11:57,68 --> 1:12:0,88
not only would there not be one dollar left in circulation,


1466
1:12:0,88 --> 1:12:4,52
there would be a gigantic amount of money owed


1467
1:12:4,52 --> 1:12:10,64
that is literally impossible to pay back, for it does not exist.


1468
1:12:10,64 --> 1:12:14,84
The consequence of all of this is that two things are inevitable:


1469
1:12:14,84 --> 1:12:17,999
Inflation and Bankruptcy.


1470
1:12:17,999 --> 1:12:18,12
.


1471
1:12:18,12 --> 1:12:21,44
As far as inflation, this can be seen as a historical trend


1472
1:12:21,44 --> 1:12:23,48
in virtually every country today,


1473
1:12:23,48 --> 1:12:25,36
and easily tied to its cause,


1474
1:12:25,36 --> 1:12:28,52
which is the perpetual increase of the money supply


1475
1:12:28,52 --> 1:12:31,5
which is required to cover the interest charges


1476
1:12:31,5 --> 1:12:34,24
and keep the system going.


1477
1:12:34,24 --> 1:12:35,68
As far as Bankruptcy,


1478
1:12:35,68 --> 1:12:39,24
it comes in the form of debt collapse.


1479
1:12:39,24 --> 1:12:42,24
This collapse will inevitably occur with a person,


1480
1:12:42,24 --> 1:12:44,16
a business or a country


1481
1:12:44,16 --> 1:12:46,8
and typically happens when the interest payments


1482
1:12:46,8 --> 1:12:50,28
are no longer possible to make.


1483
1:12:50,28 --> 1:12:52,24
But there is a bright side to all of this...


1484
1:12:52,24 --> 1:12:56,0
well, at least in terms of the market system.


1485
1:12:56,0 --> 1:12:58,96
Because debt creates pressure.


1486
1:12:58,96 --> 1:13:1,28
Debt creates wage slaves.


1487
1:13:1,28 --> 1:13:4,12
A person in debt is much more likely to take a low wage


1488
1:13:4,12 --> 1:13:5,64
than a person who isn't,


1489
1:13:5,64 --> 1:13:8,28
hence becoming a cheap commodity.


1490
1:13:8,28 --> 1:13:10,63
So it's great for corporations to have a pool of people


1491
1:13:10,63 --> 1:13:13,92
that have no financial mobility.


1492
1:13:13,92 --> 1:13:18,4
But hey - that same idea also goes for entire countries.


1493
1:13:18,4 --> 1:13:21,0
The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund,


1494
1:13:21,0 --> 1:13:25,399
which mostly serve as proxies for transnational corporate interests,


1495
1:13:25,399 --> 1:13:25,52
.


1496
1:13:25,52 --> 1:13:28,0
give gigantic loans to troubled countries


1497
1:13:28,0 --> 1:13:30,88
at very high interest rates. And then,


1498
1:13:30,88 --> 1:13:33,819
once the countries are deeply in the hole and can't pay,


1499
1:13:33,819 --> 1:13:33,92
.


1500
1:13:33,92 --> 1:13:37,459
austerity measures are applied, the corporations swoop in,


1501
1:13:37,459 --> 1:13:37,56
.


1502
1:13:37,56 --> 1:13:41,48
set up sweatshops and take their natural resources.


1503
1:13:41,48 --> 1:13:45,0
Now that's market efficiency.


1504
1:13:45,0 --> 1:13:46,88
But wait – there's more:


1505
1:13:46,88 --> 1:13:48,74
You see, there's this unique hybrid


1506
1:13:48,74 --> 1:13:50,8
of the monetary and market system


1507
1:13:50,8 --> 1:13:52,72
called the stock market.


1508
1:13:52,72 --> 1:13:56,32
Which rather than, you know, actually produce anything real,


1509
1:13:56,32 --> 1:13:59,4
they just buy and sell money itself.


1510
1:13:59,4 --> 1:14:2,36
And when it comes to debt, you know what they do?


1511
1:14:2,36 --> 1:14:5,4
That's right- they trade it!


1512
1:14:5,4 --> 1:14:9,4
They actually buy and sell debt for profit.


1513
1:14:9,4 --> 1:14:10,8
From credit default swaps and


1514
1:14:10,8 --> 1:14:14,12
collateralized debt obligations for consumer debt,


1515
1:14:14,12 --> 1:14:16,44
to complex derivative schemes used


1516
1:14:16,44 --> 1:14:19,198
to mask the debt of entire countries,


1517
1:14:19,198 --> 1:14:19,2
.


1518
1:14:19,2 --> 1:14:22,88
such as the collusion of investment bank Goldman Sachs and Greece,


1519
1:14:22,88 --> 1:14:26,48
which nearly collapsed the entire European economy.


1520
1:14:26,48 --> 1:14:29,4
So when it comes to the stock market and Wall Street,


1521
1:14:29,4 --> 1:14:32,44
we have an entirely new level of insanity


1522
1:14:32,44 --> 1:14:35,72
born out of the Money Sequence of Value.


1523
1:14:35,72 --> 1:14:37,36
All you need to know about markets


1524
1:14:37,36 --> 1:14:40,56
was written in an editorial in the Wall Street Journal


1525
1:14:40,56 --> 1:14:42,45
a couple years ago. It was called


1526
1:14:42,45 --> 1:14:45,24
"Lessons of the Brain-Damaged Investor".


1527
1:14:45,24 --> 1:14:48,28
And in this editorial, they explained why


1528
1:14:48,28 --> 1:14:51,979
people with slight brain damage do better as investors


1529
1:14:51,979 --> 1:14:52,8
.


1530
1:14:52,8 --> 1:14:54,8
than people with normal brain functionality.


1531
1:14:54,8 --> 1:14:56,68
Why? Because the slightly


1532
1:14:56,68 --> 1:14:59,5
brain-damaged person has no empathy.


1533
1:14:59,5 --> 1:15:2,0
That's the key. If you don't have any empathy


1534
1:15:2,0 --> 1:15:4,0
you do well as an investor.


1535
1:15:4,0 --> 1:15:9,1
And so Wall Street breeds people who have no empathy.


1536
1:15:9,1 --> 1:15:11,27
To go in there and to make decisions


1537
1:15:11,27 --> 1:15:14,621
and to make trades they have no compunction about


1538
1:15:14,621 --> 1:15:17,261
and no thought whatsoever as to how what they are doing


1539
1:15:17,261 --> 1:15:19,0
might affect their fellow human being.


1540
1:15:19,0 --> 1:15:21,75
So they breed these robots.


1541
1:15:21,75 --> 1:15:24,4
These people who have no souls.


1542
1:15:24,4 --> 1:15:27,12
And since they don't even want to pay these people anymore-


1543
1:15:27,12 --> 1:15:29,25
they are now breeding robots – real robots –


1544
1:15:29,25 --> 1:15:31,12
real algorithmic traders.


1545
1:15:31,12 --> 1:15:33,7
Goldman Sachs in the high frequency trading scandal:


1546
1:15:33,7 --> 1:15:37,52
They put a computer next to the New York Stock Exchange.


1547
1:15:37,52 --> 1:15:40,575
This computer, this “co-located” computer, as they call it:


1548
1:15:40,575 --> 1:15:43,0
it front-runs all the trades on the exchange and


1549
1:15:43,0 --> 1:15:45,8
hits the exchange with volumes of orders


1550
1:15:45,8 --> 1:15:47,4
in ways that "scalp"


1551
1:15:47,4 --> 1:15:49,54
pennies and nickels away from the exchange.


1552
1:15:49,54 --> 1:15:52,15
It's like they're siphoning money all day long.


1553
1:15:52,15 --> 1:15:54,88
They went one quarter last year


1554
1:15:54,88 --> 1:15:57,86
30 or 60 straight days without a single down day


1555
1:15:57,86 --> 1:16:0,3
and made millions of dollars every single day?


1556
1:16:0,3 --> 1:16:4,29
That's statistically impossible!


1557
1:16:4,29 --> 1:16:6,33
When I worked on Wall Street, the way it works is


1558
1:16:6,33 --> 1:16:8,0
everyone kicks upstairs to bribes.


1559
1:16:8,0 --> 1:16:11,96
The brokers bribe to the office manager,


1560
1:16:11,96 --> 1:16:15,37
the office manager bribes to the regional sales manager,


1561
1:16:15,37 --> 1:16:16,91
the regional sales manager


1562
1:16:16,91 --> 1:16:18,99
bribes to the national sales manager.


1563
1:16:18,99 --> 1:16:20,56
It's a common understanding.


1564
1:16:20,56 --> 1:16:23,61
At Christmas, who gets the biggest bonus at Christmas


1565
1:16:23,61 --> 1:16:26,46
in an average broker job? The compliance officer.


1566
1:16:26,46 --> 1:16:28,95
The compliance officer sits there all day long; he's supposed


1567
1:16:28,95 --> 1:16:31,559
to be making sure you don't violate any of the margin rules


1568
1:16:31,559 --> 1:16:31,76
.


1569
1:16:31,76 --> 1:16:34,0
and you're "complying" with the law.


1570
1:16:34,0 --> 1:16:36,48
Of course, yeah, to the extent that


1571
1:16:36,48 --> 1:16:38,26
you can bribe the compliance officer-


1572
1:16:38,26 --> 1:16:40,7
yeah, that's right, you are complying with the law!


1573
1:16:40,7 --> 1:16:43,17
So how has fraud become the system?


1574
1:16:43,17 --> 1:16:44,67
It's no longer a byproduct.


1575
1:16:44,67 --> 1:16:46,14
It is the system.


1576
1:16:46,14 --> 1:16:49,6
It's like that old Woody Allen joke. He says:


1577
1:16:49,6 --> 1:16:51,63
“Doctor, my brother thinks he's a chicken.”


1578
1:16:51,63 --> 1:16:53,85
And the doctor says, “Take a pill


1579
1:16:53,85 --> 1:16:55,56
and that should cure the problem.”


1580
1:16:55,56 --> 1:16:57,32
And he says, “No doctor. You don't understand.


1581
1:16:57,32 --> 1:16:58,92
We need the eggs.”


1582
1:16:58,92 --> 1:17:0,7
Okay? So ...


1583
1:17:0,7 --> 1:17:3,42
the trading of fraudulent claims back and forth


1584
1:17:3,42 --> 1:17:7,448
between banks, to generate fees, to generate bonuses,


1585
1:17:7,448 --> 1:17:7,449
.


1586
1:17:7,449 --> 1:17:7,7
.


1587
1:17:7,7 --> 1:17:12,1
has become the GDP-producing


1588
1:17:12,1 --> 1:17:13,98
growth engine of the United States economy-


1589
1:17:13,98 --> 1:17:17,2
even though they are essentially trading fraudulent claims


1590
1:17:17,2 --> 1:17:19,72
that there is absolutely no hope of ever paying back.


1591
1:17:19,72 --> 1:17:22,92
They are processing, generating and re-securitizing nothing.


1592
1:17:22,92 --> 1:17:25,76
If I write $20 billion on a cocktail napkin


1593
1:17:25,76 --> 1:17:28,6
and I sell it to J.P. Morgan and J.P. Morgan writes


1594
1:17:28,6 --> 1:17:31,52
$20 billion on a cocktail napkin


1595
1:17:31,52 --> 1:17:34,14
and we swap those two cocktail napkins at a bar,


1596
1:17:34,14 --> 1:17:37,76
and we each pay ourselves a quarter of 1% in a fee,


1597
1:17:37,76 --> 1:17:39,88
we make a lot of money for our Christmas bonus.


1598
1:17:39,88 --> 1:17:43,4
We each have on our books a $20 billion cocktail napkin


1599
1:17:43,4 --> 1:17:47,0
which has no real value, until such time as


1600
1:17:47,0 --> 1:17:50,0
the system is no longer able to absorb


1601
1:17:50,0 --> 1:17:52,94
bogus cocktail napkins, in which case we go to the government


1602
1:17:52,94 --> 1:17:55,0
to get bailed out.


1603
1:17:55,0 --> 1:17:57,81
And because of Wall Street and the global stock market


1604
1:17:57,81 --> 1:18:1,37
there are now conservatively about 700 trillion dollars


1605
1:18:1,37 --> 1:18:3,88
of outstanding fraudulent claims,


1606
1:18:3,88 --> 1:18:5,7
known as derivatives,


1607
1:18:5,7 --> 1:18:7,96
still waiting to collapse.


1608
1:18:7,96 --> 1:18:9,56
A value amounting to over


1609
1:18:9,56 --> 1:18:11,72
10 times the gross domestic product


1610
1:18:11,72 --> 1:18:14,16
of the entire planet.


1611
1:18:14,16 --> 1:18:16,0
And while we have seen the bailouts of


1612
1:18:16,0 --> 1:18:18,68
corporations and banks by governments,


1613
1:18:18,68 --> 1:18:20,66
which, of course, comically borrow their money


1614
1:18:20,66 --> 1:18:22,72
from banks to begin with,


1615
1:18:22,72 --> 1:18:25,75
we are now seeing attempts to bailout whole countries


1616
1:18:25,75 --> 1:18:28,3
by conglomerates of other countries


1617
1:18:28,3 --> 1:18:30,72
through the International banks.


1618
1:18:30,72 --> 1:18:34,2
But how do you bailout a planet?


1619
1:18:34,2 --> 1:18:38,6
There is no country out there that isn't now saturated in debt.


1620
1:18:38,6 --> 1:18:41,71
The cascade of sovereign debt defaults we have seen


1621
1:18:41,71 --> 1:18:46,16
can only be the beginning, when the math is taken into account.


1622
1:18:46,16 --> 1:18:49,28
It has been estimated in the United States alone


1623
1:18:49,28 --> 1:18:53,73
that income tax would need to be raised to  65% per person


1624
1:18:53,73 --> 1:18:57,44
just to cover the interest in the near future.


1625
1:18:57,44 --> 1:19:0,57
Economists are now foreshadowing that within a few decades


1626
1:19:0,57 --> 1:19:5,96
60% of the countries on the planet will be bankrupt.


1627
1:19:5,96 --> 1:19:9,32
But hold on-- Let me get this straight.


1628
1:19:9,32 --> 1:19:12,12
The world is going "bankrupt"


1629
1:19:12,12 --> 1:19:13,73
whatever the hell that means


1630
1:19:13,73 --> 1:19:16,17
because of this idea called "debt"


1631
1:19:16,17 --> 1:19:19,52
which doesn't even exist in the physical reality.


1632
1:19:19,52 --> 1:19:22,4
It's only part of a game we've invented...


1633
1:19:22,4 --> 1:19:25,68
and yet the well being of billions of people


1634
1:19:25,68 --> 1:19:27,99
is now being compromised.


1635
1:19:27,99 --> 1:19:32,16
Extreme layoffs, tent cities, accelerating poverty,


1636
1:19:32,16 --> 1:19:35,89
austerity measures imposed, schools shutting down,


1637
1:19:35,89 --> 1:19:40,27
child hunger and other levels of familial deprivation- ...


1638
1:19:40,27 --> 1:19:44,16
all because of this elaborate fiction...


1639
1:19:44,16 --> 1:19:48,92
What are we, fucking stupid?!


1640
1:19:48,92 --> 1:19:50,795
Hey! Hey! Mars- my man!


1641
1:19:50,795 --> 1:19:55,5
Help a brother out, uh?


1642
1:19:55,5 --> 1:20:4,32
Grow up, kid!


1643
1:20:4,32 --> 1:20:6,6
Saturn! What's up man?


1644
1:20:6,6 --> 1:20:8,92
You remember that smokin' nebula I hooked you up with


1645
1:20:8,92 --> 1:20:11,94
a while back?


1646
1:20:11,94 --> 1:20:13,54
Uh- listen Earth.


1647
1:20:13,54 --> 1:20:15,6
We're getting really tired of you.


1648
1:20:15,6 --> 1:20:18,6
You've been given everything and yet you waste it all.


1649
1:20:18,6 --> 1:20:21,32
You've got plenty of resources and you know it.


1650
1:20:21,32 --> 1:20:24,699
Why don't you grow up and learn some responsibility for Christ's sake!


1651
1:20:24,699 --> 1:20:24,96
.


1652
1:20:24,96 --> 1:20:32,68
You're making your mother miserable.


1653
1:20:32,68 --> 1:20:34,52
You're on your own, pal.


1654
1:20:34,52 --> 1:20:42,96
Yeah, whatever.


1655
1:20:42,96 --> 1:20:45,56
[ Public Health ]


1656
1:20:45,56 --> 1:20:47,8
Now, all of this considered


1657
1:20:47,8 --> 1:20:50,6
from the waste machine known as the market system


1658
1:20:50,6 --> 1:20:53,84
to the debt machine known as the monetary system-


1659
1:20:53,84 --> 1:20:57,48
hence creating the monetary-market paradigm


1660
1:20:57,48 --> 1:21:0,48
which defines the global economy today-


1661
1:21:0,48 --> 1:21:3,4
there is one consequence that runs through


1662
1:21:3,4 --> 1:21:5,56
the entire machine:


1663
1:21:5,56 --> 1:21:7,92
Inequality.


1664
1:21:7,92 --> 1:21:10,5
Whether it is the market system which creates


1665
1:21:10,5 --> 1:21:14,72
a natural gravitation towards monopoly and power consolidation


1666
1:21:14,72 --> 1:21:17,92
while also generating pockets of wealthy industries


1667
1:21:17,92 --> 1:21:21,899
that tower over others regardless of utility-


1668
1:21:21,899 --> 1:21:22,0
.


1669
1:21:22,0 --> 1:21:25,339
such as the fact that top hedge fund managers on Wall Street


1670
1:21:25,339 --> 1:21:25,44
.


1671
1:21:25,44 --> 1:21:29,0
now take home over $300 million a year


1672
1:21:29,0 --> 1:21:31,96
for contributing literally nothing,


1673
1:21:31,96 --> 1:21:35,24
while a scientist looking for a cure for a disease


1674
1:21:35,24 --> 1:21:37,2
trying to help humanity


1675
1:21:37,2 --> 1:21:41,24
might make $60,000 a year if they're lucky-


1676
1:21:41,24 --> 1:21:43,72
or whether it is the monetary system,


1677
1:21:43,72 --> 1:21:47,43
which has class division built right into its structure.


1678
1:21:47,43 --> 1:21:50,599
For example: If I have $1 million to spare


1679
1:21:50,599 --> 1:21:50,7
.


1680
1:21:50,7 --> 1:21:53,76
and I put it into a CD at 4% interest,


1681
1:21:53,76 --> 1:21:55,88
I will make $40,000 a year.


1682
1:21:55,88 --> 1:21:59,16
No social contribution- no nothing.


1683
1:21:59,16 --> 1:22:2,8
However, if I'm a lower class person and have to take loans


1684
1:22:2,8 --> 1:22:4,4
to buy my car or home,


1685
1:22:4,4 --> 1:22:7,419
I am paying in interest which in abstraction


1686
1:22:7,419 --> 1:22:7,52
.


1687
1:22:7,52 --> 1:22:11,88
is going to pay that millionaire with the 4% CD.


1688
1:22:11,88 --> 1:22:14,6
This stealing from the poor to pay the rich


1689
1:22:14,6 --> 1:22:18,92
is a foundational, built-in aspect of the monetary system


1690
1:22:18,92 --> 1:22:23,36
and it could be labeled “Structural Classism”.


1691
1:22:23,36 --> 1:22:26,0
Of course, historically, social stratification


1692
1:22:26,0 --> 1:22:30,219
has always been deemed unfair, but obviously accepted overall,


1693
1:22:30,219 --> 1:22:30,32
.


1694
1:22:30,32 --> 1:22:35,64
as now 1% of the population owns 40% of the planet's wealth.


1695
1:22:35,64 --> 1:22:38,8
But material fairness aside


1696
1:22:38,8 --> 1:22:41,859
there is something else going on underneath the surface of inequality


1697
1:22:41,859 --> 1:22:41,96
.


1698
1:22:41,96 --> 1:22:46,72
causing an incredible deterioration in public health as a whole.


1699
1:22:46,72 --> 1:22:50,3
Well, I think people often are puzzled by the contrast


1700
1:22:50,3 --> 1:22:53,4
between the material success of our societies


1701
1:22:53,4 --> 1:22:56,2
- unprecedented levels of wealth -


1702
1:22:56,2 --> 1:22:59,2
and the many social failings.


1703
1:22:59,2 --> 1:23:2,12
If you look at the rates of


1704
1:23:2,12 --> 1:23:4,98
drug abuse or violence or self-harm


1705
1:23:4,98 --> 1:23:7,76
amongst kids or mental illness


1706
1:23:7,76 --> 1:23:11,4
there is clearly something going deeply wrong


1707
1:23:11,4 --> 1:23:12,64
with our societies.


1708
1:23:12,64 --> 1:23:16,6
The data I have been describing


1709
1:23:16,6 --> 1:23:20,2
simply shows that intuition that


1710
1:23:20,2 --> 1:23:21,9
people have had for hundreds of years:


1711
1:23:21,9 --> 1:23:24,96
that inequality is divisive and socially corrosive.


1712
1:23:24,96 --> 1:23:28,92
But that intuition is truer than I think we ever imagined.


1713
1:23:28,92 --> 1:23:32,32
There are very powerful psychological and social effects


1714
1:23:32,32 --> 1:23:35,5
of inequality. More to do I suppose with feelings


1715
1:23:35,5 --> 1:23:38,44
of superiority and inferiority.


1716
1:23:38,44 --> 1:23:40,36
That kind of division...


1717
1:23:40,36 --> 1:23:43,68
Maybe going with the respect or disrespect;


1718
1:23:43,68 --> 1:23:46,28
people feeling looked down on at the bottom.


1719
1:23:46,28 --> 1:23:47,9
Which, by the way, is why violence is


1720
1:23:47,9 --> 1:23:50,84
more common in more unequal societies-


1721
1:23:50,84 --> 1:23:53,8
the trigger to violence is so often people feeling


1722
1:23:53,8 --> 1:23:55,92
looked down upon and disrespected.


1723
1:23:55,92 --> 1:23:59,92
If there is one principle I could emphasize


1724
1:23:59,92 --> 1:24:4,15
that is, the most important principle


1725
1:24:4,15 --> 1:24:7,2
underlying the prevention of violence


1726
1:24:7,2 --> 1:24:10,28
it would be “Equality”.


1727
1:24:10,28 --> 1:24:13,619
The single most significant factor that affects the rate of violence


1728
1:24:13,619 --> 1:24:13,72
.


1729
1:24:13,72 --> 1:24:17,52
is the degree of equality versus the degree of inequality


1730
1:24:17,52 --> 1:24:20,75
in that society.


1731
1:24:20,75 --> 1:24:22,92
So, what we're looking at is a sort of


1732
1:24:22,92 --> 1:24:25,0
general social dysfunction.


1733
1:24:25,0 --> 1:24:27,6
It's not just one or two things that go wrong


1734
1:24:27,6 --> 1:24:29,8
as inequality increases.


1735
1:24:29,8 --> 1:24:31,99
It seems to be everything, whether we are talking about


1736
1:24:31,99 --> 1:24:34,96
crime or health or mental illness or whatever.


1737
1:24:34,96 --> 1:24:39,8
One of the really disturbing findings out there in public health is:


1738
1:24:39,8 --> 1:24:43,12
Never ever make the mistake of being poor.


1739
1:24:43,12 --> 1:24:44,8
Or being born poor.


1740
1:24:44,8 --> 1:24:47,72
Your health pays for it in endless sorts of ways:


1741
1:24:47,72 --> 1:24:51,65
something known as the 'health socioeconomic gradient'.


1742
1:24:51,65 --> 1:24:54,65
As you move down from the highest strata in society


1743
1:24:54,65 --> 1:24:58,35
in terms of socioeconomic status, every step down,


1744
1:24:58,35 --> 1:25:1,319
health gets worse for umpteen different diseases.


1745
1:25:1,319 --> 1:25:1,36
.


1746
1:25:1,36 --> 1:25:3,0
Life expectancy gets worse.


1747
1:25:3,0 --> 1:25:6,359
Infant mortality rate- everything you could look at.


1748
1:25:6,359 --> 1:25:6,36
.


1749
1:25:6,36 --> 1:25:9,15
So, a huge issue has been:


1750
1:25:9,15 --> 1:25:12,44
why is it that this gradient exists?


1751
1:25:12,44 --> 1:25:14,68
A totally simple obvious answer which is


1752
1:25:14,68 --> 1:25:17,72
'If you're chronically sick, you're not going to be very productive


1753
1:25:17,72 --> 1:25:17,85
.


1754
1:25:17,85 --> 1:25:21,86
so health causes drive socioeconomic differences.'


1755
1:25:21,86 --> 1:25:24,879
Not that in the slightest- on the very simple level that


1756
1:25:24,879 --> 1:25:24,88
.


1757
1:25:24,88 --> 1:25:28,319
you could look at the socioeconomic status of a 10-year-old


1758
1:25:28,319 --> 1:25:28,32
.


1759
1:25:28,32 --> 1:25:31,739
and that's going to predict something about their health decades later.


1760
1:25:31,739 --> 1:25:31,74
.


1761
1:25:31,74 --> 1:25:33,92
So, that's the direction of causality.


1762
1:25:33,92 --> 1:25:37,24
Next one- ... 'Oh, it's perfectly obvious:


1763
1:25:37,24 --> 1:25:40,839
poor people can't afford to go to the doctor; it's healthcare access.'


1764
1:25:40,839 --> 1:25:40,84
.


1765
1:25:40,84 --> 1:25:44,199
It's got nothing to do with that, because you see these same gradients


1766
1:25:44,199 --> 1:25:44,2
.


1767
1:25:44,2 --> 1:25:47,799
in countries with universal health care and socialized medicine.


1768
1:25:47,799 --> 1:25:47,801
.


1769
1:25:47,801 --> 1:25:49,65
Okay – next 'simple explanation':


1770
1:25:49,65 --> 1:25:53,39
'Oh -on the average- the poorer you are the more likely you are to


1771
1:25:53,39 --> 1:25:53,4
.


1772
1:25:53,4 --> 1:25:58,13
smoke, to drink and all sorts of lifestyle risk factors.'


1773
1:25:58,13 --> 1:26:1,67
Yeah, those contribute but careful studies have shown


1774
1:26:1,67 --> 1:26:4,46
that it explains maybe about a third of the variability.


1775
1:26:4,46 --> 1:26:6,6
So what's left?


1776
1:26:6,6 --> 1:26:11,319
What's left is having a ton to do with the stress of poverty.


1777
1:26:11,319 --> 1:26:11,32
.


1778
1:26:11,32 --> 1:26:15,2
So, the poorer you are- starting off being


1779
1:26:15,2 --> 1:26:18,18
the person who is one dollar of income behind Bill Gates-


1780
1:26:18,18 --> 1:26:19,88
the poorer you are in this country


1781
1:26:19,88 --> 1:26:21,7
on the average, the worse your health is.


1782
1:26:21,7 --> 1:26:24,34
This tells us something really important:


1783
1:26:24,34 --> 1:26:26,32
the health connection with poverty


1784
1:26:26,32 --> 1:26:30,26
it's not about being poor, it's about feeling poor.


1785
1:26:30,26 --> 1:26:34,63
Increasingly we recognize that


1786
1:26:34,63 --> 1:26:38,8
chronic stress is an important influence on health.


1787
1:26:38,8 --> 1:26:40,84
But the most important sources of stress


1788
1:26:40,84 --> 1:26:43,72
are the quality of social relations.


1789
1:26:43,72 --> 1:26:47,559
And if there is anything that lowers the quality of social relations,


1790
1:26:47,559 --> 1:26:47,56
.


1791
1:26:47,56 --> 1:26:51,44
it is the socioeconomic stratification of society.


1792
1:26:51,44 --> 1:26:55,439
What science has now shown is that regardless of material wealth


1793
1:26:55,439 --> 1:26:55,54
.


1794
1:26:55,54 --> 1:26:59,19
the stress of simply living in a stratified society


1795
1:26:59,19 --> 1:27:2,88
leads to a vast spectrum of public health problems.


1796
1:27:2,88 --> 1:27:7,8
And the greater the inequality, the worse they become.


1797
1:27:7,8 --> 1:27:11,52
Life expectancy: longer in more equal countries.


1798
1:27:11,52 --> 1:27:15,58
Drug Abuse: Less in more equal countries.


1799
1:27:15,58 --> 1:27:20,0
Mental Illness: Less in more equal countries.


1800
1:27:20,0 --> 1:27:24,639
Social Capital - meaning the ability of people to trust each other:


1801
1:27:24,639 --> 1:27:24,74
.


1802
1:27:24,74 --> 1:27:27,92
Naturally greater in more equal countries.


1803
1:27:27,92 --> 1:27:32,44
Educational Scores: Higher in more equal countries.


1804
1:27:32,44 --> 1:27:37,4
Homicide rates: less in more equal countries.


1805
1:27:37,4 --> 1:27:41,999
Crime and Rates of Imprisonment: Less in more equal countries.


1806
1:27:41,999 --> 1:27:42,0
.


1807
1:27:42,0 --> 1:27:44,42
It goes on and on:


1808
1:27:44,42 --> 1:27:48,0
Infant mortality – obesity - teen birth rate:


1809
1:27:48,0 --> 1:27:49,92
Less in more equal countries.


1810
1:27:49,92 --> 1:27:52,24
and perhaps most interesting:


1811
1:27:52,24 --> 1:27:56,44
Innovation: Greater in more equal countries.


1812
1:27:56,44 --> 1:27:59,84
which challenges the age old notion that a competitive


1813
1:27:59,84 --> 1:28:4,8
stratified society is somehow more creative and inventive.


1814
1:28:4,8 --> 1:28:8,599
Moreover, a study done in the UK called The WhiteHall Study


1815
1:28:8,599 --> 1:28:8,6
.


1816
1:28:8,6 --> 1:28:11,4
confirmed that there is a social distribution of disease


1817
1:28:11,4 --> 1:28:15,359
as you go from the top of the socioeconomic ladder to the bottom.


1818
1:28:15,359 --> 1:28:15,36
.


1819
1:28:15,36 --> 1:28:18,9
For example, it was found that the lowest rungs of the hierarchy


1820
1:28:18,9 --> 1:28:22,919
had a 4-fold increase of heart disease based mortality


1821
1:28:22,919 --> 1:28:22,92
.


1822
1:28:22,92 --> 1:28:24,84
compared to the highest rungs.


1823
1:28:24,84 --> 1:28:29,2
And this pattern exists, irrespective of access to health care.


1824
1:28:29,2 --> 1:28:32,72
Hence, the worse a person's relative financial status,


1825
1:28:32,72 --> 1:28:35,96
the worse their health is going to be on average.


1826
1:28:35,96 --> 1:28:39,0
This phenomenon is rooted in what could be termed


1827
1:28:39,0 --> 1:28:41,2
'Psychosocial Stress'


1828
1:28:41,2 --> 1:28:44,5
and it is at the foundation of the greatest social distortions


1829
1:28:44,5 --> 1:28:46,84
plaguing our society today.


1830
1:28:46,84 --> 1:28:48,24
Its cause?


1831
1:28:48,24 --> 1:28:51,68
The Monetary-Market System.


1832
1:28:51,68 --> 1:28:53,7
Make no mistake:


1833
1:28:53,7 --> 1:28:56,28
The greatest destroyer of ecology,


1834
1:28:56,28 --> 1:29:0,16
the greatest source of waste, depletion and pollution,


1835
1:29:0,16 --> 1:29:2,62
the greatest purveyor of violence-


1836
1:29:2,62 --> 1:29:7,28
war - crime - poverty - animal abuse and inhumanity,


1837
1:29:7,28 --> 1:29:10,92
the greatest generator of social and personal neurosis,


1838
1:29:10,92 --> 1:29:14,4
mental disorders - depression, anxiety,


1839
1:29:14,4 --> 1:29:18,4
not to mention, the greatest source of social paralysis


1840
1:29:18,4 --> 1:29:21,28
stopping us from moving into new methodologies


1841
1:29:21,28 --> 1:29:24,28
for personal health, global sustainability


1842
1:29:24,28 --> 1:29:27,0
and progress on this planet-


1843
1:29:27,0 --> 1:29:30,72
is not some corrupt government or legislation,


1844
1:29:30,72 --> 1:29:34,88
not some rogue corporation or banking cartel,


1845
1:29:34,88 --> 1:29:37,96
not some flaw of human nature,


1846
1:29:37,96 --> 1:29:42,36
and not some secret hidden cabal that controls the world.


1847
1:29:42,36 --> 1:29:42,55
.


1848
1:29:42,55 --> 1:29:46,63
It is, in fact: The Socio-Economic System itself


1849
1:29:46,63 --> 1:30:6,0
at its very foundation.


1850
1:30:6,0 --> 1:30:10,68
[ Part 3: Project Earth ]


1851
1:30:10,68 --> 1:30:13,1
Let's imagine for a moment we had the option


1852
1:30:13,1 --> 1:30:16,22
to redesign human civilization from the ground up.


1853
1:30:16,22 --> 1:30:18,3
What if- hypothetically speaking-


1854
1:30:18,3 --> 1:30:21,4
we discovered an exact replica of the planet Earth


1855
1:30:21,4 --> 1:30:24,799
and the only difference between this new planet and our current one


1856
1:30:24,799 --> 1:30:24,8
.


1857
1:30:24,8 --> 1:30:28,639
is that human evolution had not occurred. It was an open palette.


1858
1:30:28,639 --> 1:30:28,64
.


1859
1:30:28,64 --> 1:30:32,68
No countries, no cities, no pollution, no republicans...


1860
1:30:32,68 --> 1:30:35,64
just a pristine, open environment.


1861
1:30:35,64 --> 1:30:37,74
So- what would we do?


1862
1:30:37,74 --> 1:30:40,55
Well, first we need a “goal”, right?


1863
1:30:40,55 --> 1:30:44,14
And it's safe to say that goal would be to survive.


1864
1:30:44,14 --> 1:30:46,55
And not to just survive, but to do so


1865
1:30:46,55 --> 1:30:49,3
in an optimized, healthy, prosperous way.


1866
1:30:49,3 --> 1:30:51,5
Most people, indeed, desire to live


1867
1:30:51,5 --> 1:30:54,1
and they would prefer to do so without suffering.


1868
1:30:54,1 --> 1:30:57,1
Therefore, the basis of this civilization needs to be


1869
1:30:57,1 --> 1:31:1,599
as supportive and hence sustainable for human life as possible-


1870
1:31:1,599 --> 1:31:1,6
.


1871
1:31:1,6 --> 1:31:5,319
taking into account the material needs of all the world's people


1872
1:31:5,319 --> 1:31:5,32
.


1873
1:31:5,32 --> 1:31:7,1
while trying to remove anything


1874
1:31:7,1 --> 1:31:9,52
that can could hurt us in the long run.


1875
1:31:9,52 --> 1:31:13,86
With that goal of “Maximum Sustainability” understood


1876
1:31:13,86 --> 1:31:16,64
the next question regards our “method”.


1877
1:31:16,64 --> 1:31:18,96
What kind of approach do we take?


1878
1:31:18,96 --> 1:31:20,52
Well, let's see-


1879
1:31:20,52 --> 1:31:24,86
last I checked, politics was the method of social operation on Earth...


1880
1:31:24,86 --> 1:31:27,9
so what do the doctrines of the republicans, liberals,


1881
1:31:27,9 --> 1:31:32,64
conservatives or socialists have to say about societal design?


1882
1:31:32,64 --> 1:31:35,84
Hmmm... not a damn thing.


1883
1:31:35,84 --> 1:31:37,75
Okay then- what about religion?


1884
1:31:37,75 --> 1:31:41,92
Surely the great creator had to have left some blueprints somewhere...


1885
1:31:41,92 --> 1:31:44,59
Nope... nothing I can find.


1886
1:31:44,59 --> 1:31:46,84
Okay then- so what's left?


1887
1:31:46,84 --> 1:31:49,78
It appears something called “Science”.


1888
1:31:49,78 --> 1:31:53,21
Science is unique in that its methods demand not only


1889
1:31:53,21 --> 1:31:56,6
that ideas proposed be tested and replicated,


1890
1:31:56,6 --> 1:32:1,22
but everything science comes up with is also inherently falsifiable.


1891
1:32:1,22 --> 1:32:3,8
In other words, unlike religion and politics


1892
1:32:3,8 --> 1:32:5,55
science has no ego


1893
1:32:5,55 --> 1:32:8,54
and everything it suggests accepts the possibility


1894
1:32:8,54 --> 1:32:11,42
of being proven wrong eventually.


1895
1:32:11,42 --> 1:32:14,68
It holds on to nothing and evolves constantly.


1896
1:32:14,68 --> 1:32:17,35
Well, that sounds natural enough to me.


1897
1:32:17,35 --> 1:32:20,69
So then: based on the current state of scientific knowledge


1898
1:32:20,69 --> 1:32:22,65
in the early 21st century


1899
1:32:22,65 --> 1:32:25,31
along with our goal of “maximum sustainability”


1900
1:32:25,31 --> 1:32:27,6
for the human population,


1901
1:32:27,6 --> 1:32:30,6
how do we begin the actual process of construction?


1902
1:32:30,6 --> 1:32:32,68
Well, the first question to ask is:


1903
1:32:32,68 --> 1:32:35,2
What do we need to survive?


1904
1:32:35,2 --> 1:32:38,6
The answer, of course, are Planetary Resources.


1905
1:32:38,6 --> 1:32:41,82
Whether it is the water we drink, the energy we use


1906
1:32:41,82 --> 1:32:45,7
or the raw materials we utilize to create tools and shelter,


1907
1:32:45,7 --> 1:32:48,86
the planet hosts an inventory of resources-


1908
1:32:48,86 --> 1:32:52,48
many of which are demanded for our survival.


1909
1:32:52,48 --> 1:32:54,22
So, given that reality


1910
1:32:54,22 --> 1:32:58,84
it then becomes critical to figure out what we have and where it is.


1911
1:32:58,84 --> 1:33:1,29
This means we need to conduct a survey.


1912
1:33:1,29 --> 1:33:5,11
We simply locate and identify every physical resource on the planet


1913
1:33:5,11 --> 1:33:9,24
we can, along with the amount available at each location.


1914
1:33:9,24 --> 1:33:12,71
From the deposits of copper, to the most potent locations for


1915
1:33:12,71 --> 1:33:17,159
wind farms to produce energy, to the natural fresh water springs


1916
1:33:17,159 --> 1:33:17,16
.


1917
1:33:17,16 --> 1:33:19,88
to an assessment of the amount of fish in the ocean


1918
1:33:19,88 --> 1:33:24,96
to the most prime arable land for food cultivation, etc.


1919
1:33:24,96 --> 1:33:26,95
But, since we humans are going to be


1920
1:33:26,95 --> 1:33:29,48
consuming these resources over time


1921
1:33:29,48 --> 1:33:33,72
we then realize that not only do we need to locate and identify-


1922
1:33:33,72 --> 1:33:36,18
we also need to track.


1923
1:33:36,18 --> 1:33:37,73
We need to make sure we don't run out


1924
1:33:37,73 --> 1:33:40,16
of any of this stuff; that would be bad.


1925
1:33:40,16 --> 1:33:43,6
And this means not only tracking our rates of use


1926
1:33:43,6 --> 1:33:46,46
but the rates of earthly regeneration as well


1927
1:33:46,46 --> 1:33:48,5
such as how long it takes for say,


1928
1:33:48,5 --> 1:33:52,2
a tree to grow or a spring to replenish.


1929
1:33:52,2 --> 1:33:55,8
This is called “Dynamic Equilibrium”.


1930
1:33:55,8 --> 1:34:0,0
In other words, if we use up trees faster than they can be grown back,


1931
1:34:0,0 --> 1:34:3,96
we have a serious problem, for it is unsustainable.


1932
1:34:3,96 --> 1:34:6,76
So then, how do we track this inventory


1933
1:34:6,76 --> 1:34:8,7
especially when we recognize that


1934
1:34:8,7 --> 1:34:11,6
all of this stuff is scattered everywhere?


1935
1:34:11,6 --> 1:34:15,26
We have large mineral mines in what we call Africa,


1936
1:34:15,26 --> 1:34:17,66
energy concentrations in the Middle East,


1937
1:34:17,66 --> 1:34:21,7
huge tidal power possibilities on the Atlantic coast of North America,


1938
1:34:21,7 --> 1:34:25,88
the largest supply of fresh water in Brazil, etc.


1939
1:34:25,88 --> 1:34:29,88
Well, once again, good old science has a suggestion:


1940
1:34:29,88 --> 1:34:32,2
It's called “Systems theory”.


1941
1:34:32,2 --> 1:34:36,16
Systems theory recognizes that the fabric of the natural world,


1942
1:34:36,16 --> 1:34:39,46
from human biology to the earthly biosphere


1943
1:34:39,46 --> 1:34:42,7
to the gravitational pull of the solar system itself,


1944
1:34:42,7 --> 1:34:47,84
is one huge synergistically connected system - fully interlinked.


1945
1:34:47,84 --> 1:34:50,64
Just as human cells connect to form our organs


1946
1:34:50,64 --> 1:34:53,9
and the organs connect to form our bodies


1947
1:34:53,9 --> 1:34:56,38
and since our bodies cannot live without the earthy resources


1948
1:34:56,38 --> 1:35:1,1
of food, air and water, we are intrinsically connected to the earth.


1949
1:35:1,1 --> 1:35:2,88
And so on.


1950
1:35:2,88 --> 1:35:6,12
So, as nature suggests, we take all of this inventory


1951
1:35:6,12 --> 1:35:10,14
and tracking data, and create a “system” to manage it.


1952
1:35:10,14 --> 1:35:13,56
A “Global Resource Management System”, in fact,


1953
1:35:13,56 --> 1:35:17,0
to account for every relevant resource on the planet.


1954
1:35:17,0 --> 1:35:21,11
There is simply no logical alternative, if our goal as a species


1955
1:35:21,11 --> 1:35:26,28
is survival in the long run. We have to keep track as a whole.


1956
1:35:26,28 --> 1:35:29,58
That understood, we can now consider production.


1957
1:35:29,58 --> 1:35:31,32
How do we use all this stuff?


1958
1:35:31,32 --> 1:35:34,56
What will our process of production be, and what do we need


1959
1:35:34,56 --> 1:35:38,54
to consider to make sure it is as optimized as possible,


1960
1:35:38,54 --> 1:35:41,7
to maximize our sustainability?


1961
1:35:41,7 --> 1:35:44,55
Well, the first thing that jumps right out at us, is the fact


1962
1:35:44,55 --> 1:35:47,62
that we need to constantly try and preserve.


1963
1:35:47,62 --> 1:35:50,74
The planet's resources are essentially finite.


1964
1:35:50,74 --> 1:35:53,82
So it is important that we be “strategic”.


1965
1:35:53,82 --> 1:35:57,24
"Strategic Preservation" is key.


1966
1:35:57,24 --> 1:36:0,49
The second thing we recognize, is that some resources


1967
1:36:0,49 --> 1:36:3,28
are really not as good as others in their performance.


1968
1:36:3,28 --> 1:36:6,16
In fact, some of this stuff when put into use


1969
1:36:6,16 --> 1:36:8,28
has a terrible effect on the environment,


1970
1:36:8,28 --> 1:36:10,9
which invariably hinders our own health.


1971
1:36:10,9 --> 1:36:15,36
For example: oil and fossil fuels, no matter how you cut it,


1972
1:36:15,36 --> 1:36:18,84
release some pretty destructive agents into the environment.


1973
1:36:18,84 --> 1:36:22,35
Therefore, it is critical we do our best to use such things


1974
1:36:22,35 --> 1:36:25,92
only when we really have to- if at all.


1975
1:36:25,92 --> 1:36:30,82
Fortunately for us, we see a ton of solar – wind – tidal – wave –


1976
1:36:30,82 --> 1:36:35,4
heat differential and geothermal possibilities for energy production.


1977
1:36:35,4 --> 1:36:39,48
So we can strategize objectively, about what we use and where,


1978
1:36:39,48 --> 1:36:43,72
to avoid what could be called “negative retroactions”,


1979
1:36:43,72 --> 1:36:46,76
or anything that results from production or use


1980
1:36:46,76 --> 1:36:50,76
that damages the environment and hence, ourselves.


1981
1:36:50,76 --> 1:36:53,76
We will call this “Strategic Safety”


1982
1:36:53,76 --> 1:36:57,88
to couple in with our "Strategic Preservation”.


1983
1:36:57,88 --> 1:37:0,44
But production strategies do not stop there.


1984
1:37:0,44 --> 1:37:3,52
We are going to need an "Efficiency Strategy”,


1985
1:37:3,52 --> 1:37:6,72
for the actual mechanics of production itself.


1986
1:37:6,72 --> 1:37:8,52
And what we find is that there are roughly


1987
1:37:8,52 --> 1:37:12,12
three specific protocols we must adhere to:


1988
1:37:12,12 --> 1:37:15,5
1: Every good we produce must be designed


1989
1:37:15,5 --> 1:37:17,28
to last as long as possible.


1990
1:37:17,28 --> 1:37:19,48
Naturally, the more things break down,


1991
1:37:19,48 --> 1:37:22,48
the more resources we are going to need to replace them,


1992
1:37:22,48 --> 1:37:24,98
and the more waste produced.


1993
1:37:24,98 --> 1:37:27,44
2: When things do break down,


1994
1:37:27,44 --> 1:37:30,2
or are no longer usable for whatever reason,


1995
1:37:30,2 --> 1:37:32,8
it is critical that we harvest, or recycle


1996
1:37:32,8 --> 1:37:34,72
as much as we possibly can.


1997
1:37:34,72 --> 1:37:38,69
So the production design must take this into account directly


1998
1:37:38,69 --> 1:37:41,68
at the very earliest stages.


1999
1:37:41,68 --> 1:37:45,88
3: Quickly evolving technologies, such as electronics,


2000
1:37:45,88 --> 1:37:49,75
which are subject to the fastest rates of technological obsolescence,


2001
1:37:49,75 --> 1:37:52,8
would need to be designed to foreshadow


2002
1:37:52,8 --> 1:37:55,44
and accommodate physical updates.


2003
1:37:55,44 --> 1:37:59,45
The last thing we want to do is throw away an entire computer system


2004
1:37:59,45 --> 1:38:3,8
just because it has only one broken part, or is outdated.


2005
1:38:3,8 --> 1:38:6,88
So we simply design the components to be easily updated,


2006
1:38:6,88 --> 1:38:11,34
part by part, standardized and universally interchangeable,


2007
1:38:11,34 --> 1:38:15,68
foreshadowed by the current trend of technological change.


2008
1:38:15,68 --> 1:38:19,44
And when we realize that the mechanisms of "Strategic Preservation”,


2009
1:38:19,44 --> 1:38:23,1
“Strategic Safety” and “Strategic Efficiency”


2010
1:38:23,1 --> 1:38:25,68
are purely technical considerations


2011
1:38:25,68 --> 1:38:28,88
devoid of any human opinion or bias,


2012
1:38:28,88 --> 1:38:32,16
we simply program these strategies into a computer


2013
1:38:32,16 --> 1:38:35,0
which can weigh and calculate all the relevant variables,


2014
1:38:35,0 --> 1:38:37,24
allowing us to always arrive


2015
1:38:37,24 --> 1:38:40,8
at the absolute best method for sustainable production


2016
1:38:40,8 --> 1:38:43,56
based on current understandings.


2017
1:38:43,56 --> 1:38:46,4
And while that might sound complex


2018
1:38:46,4 --> 1:38:48,52
all it is, is a glorified calculator,


2019
1:38:48,52 --> 1:38:50,72
not to mention that such multi-varied


2020
1:38:50,72 --> 1:38:52,85
decision making and monitoring systems,


2021
1:38:52,85 --> 1:38:56,75
are already used across the world today for isolated purposes.


2022
1:38:56,75 --> 1:39:0,16
It is simply a process of scaling it out.


2023
1:39:0,16 --> 1:39:1,4
So...


2024
1:39:1,4 --> 1:39:4,72
Now, we not only have our Resource Management System,


2025
1:39:4,72 --> 1:39:7,8
but also a Production Management System,


2026
1:39:7,8 --> 1:39:10,43
both of which are easily computer automated


2027
1:39:10,43 --> 1:39:14,22
to maximize efficiency, preservation and safety.


2028
1:39:14,22 --> 1:39:17,42
The informational reality is that the human mind


2029
1:39:17,42 --> 1:39:21,42
or even a group of humans, cannot track what needs to be tracked.


2030
1:39:21,42 --> 1:39:25,84
It must be done by computers, and it can be.


2031
1:39:25,84 --> 1:39:29,4
And this bring us to the next level: Distribution.


2032
1:39:29,4 --> 1:39:32,48
What sustainability strategies make sense here?


2033
1:39:32,48 --> 1:39:34,75
Well, since we know that the shortest distance


2034
1:39:34,75 --> 1:39:37,9
between two points is a straight line,


2035
1:39:37,9 --> 1:39:40,64
and since energy is required to power transport machines,


2036
1:39:40,64 --> 1:39:44,16
the less transport distance, the more efficient.


2037
1:39:44,16 --> 1:39:48,6
Producing goods in one continent and shipping them over to another


2038
1:39:48,6 --> 1:39:51,0
only makes sense if the goods in question


2039
1:39:51,0 --> 1:39:54,0
simply cannot be produced in the target area.


2040
1:39:54,0 --> 1:39:56,72
Otherwise, it is nothing but wasteful.


2041
1:39:56,72 --> 1:40:0,4
We must localize production, so distribution is simple,


2042
1:40:0,4 --> 1:40:3,56
fast, and requires the least amount of energy.


2043
1:40:3,56 --> 1:40:6,48
We'll call this the “Proximity Strategy”,


2044
1:40:6,48 --> 1:40:8,0
which simply means we reduce


2045
1:40:8,0 --> 1:40:10,28
the travel of goods as much as possible


2046
1:40:10,28 --> 1:40:14,32
whether raw materials or finished consumer products.


2047
1:40:14,32 --> 1:40:16,67
Of course, it might also be important to know


2048
1:40:16,67 --> 1:40:19,52
what goods we are transporting and why.


2049
1:40:19,52 --> 1:40:22,76
And this falls under the category of Demand.


2050
1:40:22,76 --> 1:40:25,75
And demand is simply what people need to be healthy


2051
1:40:25,75 --> 1:40:28,0
and to have a high quality of life.


2052
1:40:28,0 --> 1:40:30,37
The spectrum of material human needs


2053
1:40:30,37 --> 1:40:33,36
range from core life supporting necessities


2054
1:40:33,36 --> 1:40:36,52
such as food, clean water and shelter,


2055
1:40:36,52 --> 1:40:40,28
to social and recreational goods which allow for relaxation


2056
1:40:40,28 --> 1:40:42,72
and personal, social enjoyment:


2057
1:40:42,72 --> 1:40:47,68
both important factors in human and social health overall.


2058
1:40:47,68 --> 1:40:50,48
So, very simply, we take another survey.


2059
1:40:50,48 --> 1:40:53,23
People describe their needs, demand is assessed,


2060
1:40:53,23 --> 1:40:56,2
and production begins based on that demand.


2061
1:40:56,2 --> 1:40:58,71
And since the level of demand of different goods


2062
1:40:58,71 --> 1:41:2,76
will naturally fluctuate and change around different regions,


2063
1:41:2,76 --> 1:41:6,68
we need to create a “Demand / Distribution Tracking System"


2064
1:41:6,68 --> 1:41:10,28
so to avoid overruns and shortages.


2065
1:41:10,28 --> 1:41:12,23
Of course, this idea is old news;


2066
1:41:12,23 --> 1:41:15,44
it is used in every major store chain today


2067
1:41:15,44 --> 1:41:18,16
to make sure they keep up with their inventory.


2068
1:41:18,16 --> 1:41:21,92
Only this time, we are tracking on a global scale.


2069
1:41:21,92 --> 1:41:25,86
But, wait a minute. We really can't fully understand demand


2070
1:41:25,86 --> 1:41:30,4
if we don't account for the actual usage of the good itself.


2071
1:41:30,4 --> 1:41:34,19
Is it logical and sustainable for every single human to say,


2072
1:41:34,19 --> 1:41:38,64
have one of everything made? Regardless of their usage?


2073
1:41:38,64 --> 1:41:43,0
No. That would be simply wasteful and inefficient.


2074
1:41:43,0 --> 1:41:46,93
If a person has a need for a good but that need is only for say,


2075
1:41:46,93 --> 1:41:50,699
45 minutes a day on average, it would be much more efficient


2076
1:41:50,699 --> 1:41:50,74
.


2077
1:41:50,74 --> 1:41:52,84
if that good was made available to them


2078
1:41:52,84 --> 1:41:56,0
and to others when needed.


2079
1:41:56,0 --> 1:41:58,7
Many forget that it isn't the good that they want,


2080
1:41:58,7 --> 1:42:0,98
it is the purpose of that good.


2081
1:42:0,98 --> 1:42:2,63
When we realize that the good itself


2082
1:42:2,63 --> 1:42:5,24
is only as important as its utility,


2083
1:42:5,24 --> 1:42:8,8
we see that “external restriction”,


2084
1:42:8,8 --> 1:42:10,84
or what we might call today “ownership”,


2085
1:42:10,84 --> 1:42:14,22
is extremely wasteful and environmentally illogical


2086
1:42:14,22 --> 1:42:17,6
in a fundamental, economic sense.


2087
1:42:17,6 --> 1:42:22,82
So, we need to devise a strategy called: “Strategic Access”.


2088
1:42:22,82 --> 1:42:24,52
This would be the foundation of our


2089
1:42:24,52 --> 1:42:26,92
"Demand / Distribution Tracking System”


2090
1:42:26,92 --> 1:42:28,32
which makes sure we can meet


2091
1:42:28,32 --> 1:42:30,36
the demand of the population's needs


2092
1:42:30,36 --> 1:42:34,84
for access of whatever they need, when they need it.


2093
1:42:34,84 --> 1:42:37,56
And as far as physically obtaining the goods,


2094
1:42:37,56 --> 1:42:40,12
centralized and regional access centers


2095
1:42:40,12 --> 1:42:42,48
all make sense for the most part,


2096
1:42:42,48 --> 1:42:45,68
placed in close proximity to the population


2097
1:42:45,68 --> 1:42:48,56
and a person would simply come in, take the item,


2098
1:42:48,56 --> 1:42:52,28
use it and when finished, return it when it is no longer needed...


2099
1:42:52,28 --> 1:42:54,68
sort of how a library works today.


2100
1:42:54,68 --> 1:42:57,47
In fact, these centers could not only exist in the community


2101
1:42:57,47 --> 1:43:0,14
in the way we see local stores today,


2102
1:43:0,14 --> 1:43:4,36
but specialized access centers would exist in specific areas


2103
1:43:4,36 --> 1:43:6,84
where often certain goods are utilized,


2104
1:43:6,84 --> 1:43:10,56
saving more energy with less repeat transport.


2105
1:43:10,56 --> 1:43:13,75
And once this Demand Tracking System is in order,


2106
1:43:13,75 --> 1:43:16,6
it is tied into our Production Management system,


2107
1:43:16,6 --> 1:43:20,4
and of course, into our Resource Management system.


2108
1:43:20,4 --> 1:43:23,8
Hence creating a unified, dynamically updating,


2109
1:43:23,8 --> 1:43:26,4
global economic management machine,


2110
1:43:26,4 --> 1:43:28,88
that simply makes sure we remain sustainable.


2111
1:43:28,88 --> 1:43:32,76
Starting with securing the integrity of our finite resources,


2112
1:43:32,76 --> 1:43:35,26
moving to make sure we only create the best,


2113
1:43:35,26 --> 1:43:37,6
most strategic goods possible,


2114
1:43:37,6 --> 1:43:39,15
while distributing everything


2115
1:43:39,15 --> 1:43:42,72
in the most intelligent and efficient way.


2116
1:43:42,72 --> 1:43:47,4
And the unique result of this preservation-based approach,


2117
1:43:47,4 --> 1:43:50,16
which is intuitively counter to many,


2118
1:43:50,16 --> 1:43:52,8
is that this logical, ground up


2119
1:43:52,8 --> 1:43:56,16
empirical process of preservation and efficiency


2120
1:43:56,16 --> 1:44:1,4
- which can only define true human sustainability on this planet -


2121
1:44:1,4 --> 1:44:5,72
would likely enable something never before seen in human history:


2122
1:44:5,72 --> 1:44:7,84
Access Abundance.


2123
1:44:7,84 --> 1:44:11,8
Not just for a percentage of the global population,


2124
1:44:11,8 --> 1:44:15,56
but the entire civilization.


2125
1:44:15,56 --> 1:44:18,28
This economic model, as was just generalized...


2126
1:44:18,28 --> 1:44:21,0
this responsible, systems approach


2127
1:44:21,0 --> 1:44:24,12
to total Earth resource management and processes,


2128
1:44:24,12 --> 1:44:26,7
designed, again, to do nothing less


2129
1:44:26,7 --> 1:44:28,2
than take care of humanity as a whole


2130
1:44:28,2 --> 1:44:31,4
in the most efficient and sustainable way,


2131
1:44:31,4 --> 1:44:32,36
could be termed:


2132
1:44:32,36 --> 1:44:35,48
a “RESOURCE-BASED ECONOMY”.


2133
1:44:35,48 --> 1:44:38,7
The idea was defined in the 1970s


2134
1:44:38,7 --> 1:44:41,12
by structural engineer Jacque Fresco.


2135
1:44:41,12 --> 1:44:44,38
He understood back then that society was on a collision course


2136
1:44:44,38 --> 1:44:48,64
with nature and itself, unsustainable on every level,


2137
1:44:48,64 --> 1:44:50,56
and if things didn't change,


2138
1:44:50,56 --> 1:44:54,0
we would destroy ourselves, one way or another.


2139
1:44:54,0 --> 1:44:56,7
Are all of these things you are saying Jacque,


2140
1:44:56,7 --> 1:44:58,84
could they be built with what we know today?


2141
1:44:58,84 --> 1:45:1,3
Or, ... are you guessing


2142
1:45:1,3 --> 1:45:2,54
based on what we know today?


2143
1:45:2,54 --> 1:45:6,38
No. All of these things can be built with what we know today.


2144
1:45:6,38 --> 1:45:9,64
It would take 10 years to change the surface of the earth.


2145
1:45:9,64 --> 1:45:12,2
To rebuild the world into a second Garden of Eden.


2146
1:45:12,2 --> 1:45:13,8
The choice lies with you.


2147
1:45:13,8 --> 1:45:16,34
The stupidity of a nuclear arms race,


2148
1:45:16,34 --> 1:45:17,94
the development of weapons,


2149
1:45:17,94 --> 1:45:20,1
trying to solve your problems politically


2150
1:45:20,1 --> 1:45:23,12
by electing this political party or that political party,


2151
1:45:23,12 --> 1:45:25,78
that all politics is immersed in corruption.


2152
1:45:25,78 --> 1:45:26,9
Let me say it again:


2153
1:45:26,9 --> 1:45:31,38
Communism, socialism, fascism, the Democrats, the liberals-


2154
1:45:31,38 --> 1:45:33,66
we want to absorb human beings ...


2155
1:45:33,66 --> 1:45:37,4
all organizations that believe in a better life for man!


2156
1:45:37,4 --> 1:45:40,26
There are no Negro problems or Polish problems


2157
1:45:40,26 --> 1:45:42,58
or Jewish problems or Greek problems


2158
1:45:42,58 --> 1:45:45,25
or women's problems – there are human problems!


2159
1:45:45,25 --> 1:45:47,98
I'm not afraid of anybody, I don't work for anyone;


2160
1:45:47,98 --> 1:45:49,58
no one can discharge me.


2161
1:45:49,58 --> 1:45:51,18
I have no boss.


2162
1:45:51,18 --> 1:45:54,14
I am afraid to live in the society we live in today.


2163
1:45:54,14 --> 1:45:57,94
Our society cannot be maintained by this type of incompetency.


2164
1:45:57,94 --> 1:46:0,6
It was great- the free enterprise system-


2165
1:46:0,6 --> 1:46:3,5
about 35 years ago. That was the last of its usefulness.


2166
1:46:3,5 --> 1:46:8,4
Now we have got to change our way of thinking or perish.


2167
1:46:8,4 --> 1:46:12,9
The horror movies of the future will be our society-


2168
1:46:12,9 --> 1:46:14,12
the way it didn't work-


2169
1:46:14,12 --> 1:46:15,84
and politics ...


2170
1:46:15,84 --> 1:46:19,8
would be part of a horror movie.


2171
1:46:19,8 --> 1:46:25,0
Well, lots of people today use the term 'cold science'


2172
1:46:25,0 --> 1:46:27,32
because it's analytical,


2173
1:46:27,32 --> 1:46:30,2
and they don't even know what analytical means.


2174
1:46:30,2 --> 1:46:32,86
Science means: closer approximations


2175
1:46:32,86 --> 1:46:35,61
to the way the world really works.


2176
1:46:35,61 --> 1:46:38,965
So, it's telling the truth- is what it is.


2177
1:46:38,965 --> 1:46:41,99
A scientist doesn't try to get along with people.


2178
1:46:41,99 --> 1:46:44,65
They tell them what their findings are.


2179
1:46:44,65 --> 1:46:47,2
They have to question all things.


2180
1:46:47,2 --> 1:46:50,2
And if some scientist comes up with an experiment


2181
1:46:50,2 --> 1:46:53,69
that shows certain materials have certain strengths,


2182
1:46:53,69 --> 1:46:57,2
other scientists have to be able to duplicate that experiment


2183
1:46:57,2 --> 1:46:59,26
and come up with the same results.


2184
1:46:59,26 --> 1:47:3,74
Even if a scientist feels that an airplane wing


2185
1:47:3,74 --> 1:47:5,62
due to mathematics or calculations


2186
1:47:5,62 --> 1:47:7,96
can hold up a given amount of weight


2187
1:47:7,96 --> 1:47:10,78
they still pile sandbags on it


2188
1:47:10,78 --> 1:47:13,12
to see when it breaks, and they say


2189
1:47:13,12 --> 1:47:16,8
'you know my calculations are right' or 'they are not correct.'


2190
1:47:16,8 --> 1:47:20,8
I love that system because it's free of bias


2191
1:47:20,8 --> 1:47:23,62
and free of thinking that math can solve all the problems.


2192
1:47:23,62 --> 1:47:26,3
You have to put your Math to test also.


2193
1:47:26,3 --> 1:47:30,1
I think that every system that can be put to test


2194
1:47:30,1 --> 1:47:31,94
should be put to test.


2195
1:47:31,94 --> 1:47:36,94
And that all decisions should be based upon research.


2196
1:47:36,94 --> 1:47:39,2
A Resource-Based Economy is simply


2197
1:47:39,2 --> 1:47:42,32
the scientific method applied to social concern-


2198
1:47:42,32 --> 1:47:45,32
an approach utterly absent in the world today.


2199
1:47:45,32 --> 1:47:47,68
Society is a technical invention.


2200
1:47:47,68 --> 1:47:50,78
And the most efficient methods of optimized human health,


2201
1:47:50,78 --> 1:47:55,25
physical production, distribution, city infrastructure and the like


2202
1:47:55,25 --> 1:47:57,84
reside in the field of science and technology-


2203
1:47:57,84 --> 1:48:1,0
not politics or monetary economics.


2204
1:48:1,0 --> 1:48:5,15
It operates in the same systematic way as, say an airplane


2205
1:48:5,15 --> 1:48:9,5
and there is no Republican or Liberal way to build an airplane.


2206
1:48:9,5 --> 1:48:13,1
Likewise, nature itself is the physical referent we use


2207
1:48:13,1 --> 1:48:16,179
to prove our science, and it is a set system-


2208
1:48:16,179 --> 1:48:16,32
.


2209
1:48:16,32 --> 1:48:19,57
emerging only from our increased understanding of it.


2210
1:48:19,57 --> 1:48:21,85
In fact, it has no regard for what you


2211
1:48:21,85 --> 1:48:24,77
subjectively think or believe to be true.


2212
1:48:24,77 --> 1:48:26,66
Rather, it gives you an option:


2213
1:48:26,66 --> 1:48:29,6
you can learn and fall in line with its natural laws


2214
1:48:29,6 --> 1:48:31,18
and conduct yourself accordingly-


2215
1:48:31,18 --> 1:48:34,6
invariably creating good health and sustainability,


2216
1:48:34,6 --> 1:48:37,77
or you can go against the current- to no avail.


2217
1:48:37,77 --> 1:48:39,85
It doesn't matter how much you believe you can just


2218
1:48:39,85 --> 1:48:42,52
stand up right now and walk on the wall next to you;


2219
1:48:42,52 --> 1:48:44,74
the law of gravity will not allow it.


2220
1:48:44,74 --> 1:48:46,72
If you do not eat- you will die.


2221
1:48:46,72 --> 1:48:49,72
If you are not touched as an infant- you will die.


2222
1:48:49,72 --> 1:48:53,66
As harsh as it may sound, nature is a dictatorship


2223
1:48:53,66 --> 1:48:57,1
and we can either listen to it and come in harmony with it


2224
1:48:57,1 --> 1:49:0,66
or suffer the inevitable adverse consequences.


2225
1:49:0,66 --> 1:49:2,48
So, a Resource-Based Economy


2226
1:49:2,48 --> 1:49:4,96
is nothing more than a set of proven,


2227
1:49:4,96 --> 1:49:6,875
life supporting understandings


2228
1:49:6,875 --> 1:49:9,12
where all decisions are based upon


2229
1:49:9,12 --> 1:49:12,92
optimized human and environmental sustainability.


2230
1:49:12,92 --> 1:49:16,22
It takes into account the empirical “Life Ground”


2231
1:49:16,22 --> 1:49:18,72
which every human being shares as a need


2232
1:49:18,72 --> 1:49:22,84
regardless, again, of their political or religious philosophy.


2233
1:49:22,84 --> 1:49:26,5
There is no cultural relativism to this approach.


2234
1:49:26,5 --> 1:49:28,8
It isn't a matter of o


2235
1:49:28,8 --> 1:49:30,96
Human needs are human needs.


2236
1:49:30,96 --> 1:49:34,685
And having access to the necessities of life, such as clean air,


2237
1:49:34,685 --> 1:49:37,165
nutritious food and clean water,


2238
1:49:37,165 --> 1:49:40,72
along with a positively reinforcing, stable,


2239
1:49:40,72 --> 1:49:43,67
nurturing, non-violent environment,


2240
1:49:43,67 --> 1:49:47,1
is demanded for our mental and physical health,


2241
1:49:47,1 --> 1:49:49,4
our evolutionary fitness,


2242
1:49:49,4 --> 1:49:52,6
and hence, the species' survival itself.


2243
1:49:52,6 --> 1:49:54,89
A Resource-Based Economy


2244
1:49:54,89 --> 1:49:58,31
would be based upon available resources.


2245
1:49:58,31 --> 1:50:1,51
You can't just bring a lot of people to an island


2246
1:50:1,51 --> 1:50:6,72
or build a city of 50,000 people without having access


2247
1:50:6,72 --> 1:50:8,8
to the necessities of life.


2248
1:50:8,8 --> 1:50:13,36
So, when I use the term 'a comprehensive systems approach'


2249
1:50:13,36 --> 1:50:17,62
I'm talking about doing an inventory of the area first


2250
1:50:17,62 --> 1:50:20,96
and determining what that area can supply-


2251
1:50:20,96 --> 1:50:23,48
not just architectural approach-


2252
1:50:23,48 --> 1:50:26,0
not just design approach-


2253
1:50:26,0 --> 1:50:29,6
but design must be based on all of the requirements


2254
1:50:29,6 --> 1:50:31,24
to enhance human life.


2255
1:50:31,24 --> 1:50:35,4
And that's what I mean by an integrated way of thinking.


2256
1:50:35,4 --> 1:50:37,88
Food, clothing, shelter, warmth, love-


2257
1:50:37,88 --> 1:50:40,92
all those things are necessary.


2258
1:50:40,92 --> 1:50:43,4
And if you deprive people of any of them


2259
1:50:43,4 --> 1:50:49,28
you have a lesser human being, less capable of functioning.


2260
1:50:49,28 --> 1:50:53,12
As previously outlined, a Resource-Based Economy's ground-up


2261
1:50:53,12 --> 1:50:57,82
global, systems approach to extraction, production and distribution


2262
1:50:57,82 --> 1:51:2,64
is based upon on a set of true economic mechanisms, or 'strategies'


2263
1:51:2,64 --> 1:51:5,8
which guarantee efficiency and sustainability


2264
1:51:5,8 --> 1:51:8,72
in every area of the economy.


2265
1:51:8,72 --> 1:51:12,54
So, continuing this train of thought regarding logical design,


2266
1:51:12,54 --> 1:51:14,32
what is next in our equation?


2267
1:51:14,32 --> 1:51:16,84
Where does all this materialize?


2268
1:51:16,84 --> 1:51:18,4
Cities.


2269
1:51:18,4 --> 1:51:22,36
The advent of the city is a defining feature of modern civilization.


2270
1:51:22,36 --> 1:51:26,2
Its role is to enable efficient access to the necessities of life


2271
1:51:26,2 --> 1:51:31,2
along with increased social support and community interaction.


2272
1:51:31,2 --> 1:51:34,16
So how would we go about designing an ideal city?


2273
1:51:34,16 --> 1:51:35,72
What shape should we make it?


2274
1:51:35,72 --> 1:51:38,16
Square? Trapezoid?


2275
1:51:38,16 --> 1:51:40,32
Well, given we are going to be moving around the thing


2276
1:51:40,32 --> 1:51:43,56
we might as well make it as equidistant as possible for ease,


2277
1:51:43,56 --> 1:51:45,92
hence the circle.


2278
1:51:45,92 --> 1:51:47,72
What should the city contain?


2279
1:51:47,72 --> 1:51:51,76
Well, naturally we need a residential area, a goods production area,


2280
1:51:51,76 --> 1:51:55,68
a power generation area, an agricultural area.


2281
1:51:55,68 --> 1:51:58,1
But we also need nurturing as human beings-


2282
1:51:58,1 --> 1:52:2,16
hence culture, nature, recreation and education.


2283
1:52:2,16 --> 1:52:4,2
So lets include a nice open park,


2284
1:52:4,2 --> 1:52:8,68
an entertainment/events area for cultural purposes and socializing


2285
1:52:8,68 --> 1:52:11,23
and educational and research facilities.


2286
1:52:11,23 --> 1:52:13,0
And since we are working with a circle


2287
1:52:13,0 --> 1:52:16,48
it seems rational to place these functions in belts


2288
1:52:16,48 --> 1:52:19,6
based on the amount of land required for each goal


2289
1:52:19,6 --> 1:52:21,9
along with ease of access.


2290
1:52:21,9 --> 1:52:23,56
Very good.


2291
1:52:23,56 --> 1:52:25,76
Now, let's get down to specifics:


2292
1:52:25,76 --> 1:52:28,38
First we need the consider the core infrastructure


2293
1:52:28,38 --> 1:52:31,16
or intestines of the city organism.


2294
1:52:31,16 --> 1:52:33,28
These would be the water, goods,


2295
1:52:33,28 --> 1:52:35,68
waste and energy transport channels.


2296
1:52:35,68 --> 1:52:39,52
Just as we have water and sewage systems under our cities today,


2297
1:52:39,52 --> 1:52:41,5
we would extend this channeling concept


2298
1:52:41,5 --> 1:52:45,2
to integrate waste recycling and delivery itself.


2299
1:52:45,2 --> 1:52:47,66
No more mailmen or garbage men.


2300
1:52:47,66 --> 1:52:49,82
It is built right in. We could even use


2301
1:52:49,82 --> 1:52:53,56
automated pneumatic tubes and similar technologies.


2302
1:52:53,56 --> 1:52:55,48
Same goes for transport.


2303
1:52:55,48 --> 1:52:58,64
It needs to be integrated and strategically designed to reduce


2304
1:52:58,64 --> 1:53:2,76
or even remove the need for wasteful, independent automobiles.


2305
1:53:2,76 --> 1:53:5,68
Electric trams, conveyors, transveyors


2306
1:53:5,68 --> 1:53:7,45
and maglevs- which can take you virtually


2307
1:53:7,45 --> 1:53:10,44
anywhere in the city, even up and down,


2308
1:53:10,44 --> 1:53:13,56
along with connecting you to other cities as well.


2309
1:53:13,56 --> 1:53:16,54
And of course, in the event a car is required,


2310
1:53:16,54 --> 1:53:20,32
it is automated by satellite for safety and integrity.


2311
1:53:20,32 --> 1:53:24,16
In fact, this automation technology is in working order right now.


2312
1:53:24,16 --> 1:53:29,8
Automobile accidents kill about 1.2 million people every single year,


2313
1:53:29,8 --> 1:53:31,3
injuring about 50 million.


2314
1:53:31,3 --> 1:53:34,16
This is absurd and doesn't have to occur.


2315
1:53:34,16 --> 1:53:37,92
Between efficient city design and automated, driverless cars


2316
1:53:37,92 --> 1:53:41,14
this death toll can be virtually eliminated.


2317
1:53:41,14 --> 1:53:42,72
Agriculture.


2318
1:53:42,72 --> 1:53:46,24
Today, through our haphazard, cost-cutting industrial methods-


2319
1:53:46,24 --> 1:53:50,44
using pesticides, excessive fertilizers and other means-


2320
1:53:50,44 --> 1:53:52,45
we have successfully destroyed


2321
1:53:52,45 --> 1:53:54,38
much of the the arable land on this planet,


2322
1:53:54,38 --> 1:53:57,84
not to mention also extensively poisoning our bodies.


2323
1:53:57,84 --> 1:54:1,16
In fact, industrial and agricultural chemical toxins


2324
1:54:1,16 --> 1:54:7,2
now show up in virtually every human being tested, including infants.


2325
1:54:7,2 --> 1:54:9,89
Fortunately, there is a glaring alternative:


2326
1:54:9,89 --> 1:54:13,64
the soil-less mediums of hydroponics and aeroponics,


2327
1:54:13,64 --> 1:54:16,815
which also reduce nutrient and water requirements


2328
1:54:16,815 --> 1:54:20,48
by up to 75% of our current usage.


2329
1:54:20,48 --> 1:54:24,16
Food can now be organically grown on an industrial scale


2330
1:54:24,16 --> 1:54:26,72
in enclosed vertical farms,


2331
1:54:26,72 --> 1:54:29,68
such as in 50-story 1-acre plots,


2332
1:54:29,68 --> 1:54:31,42
virtually eliminating the need


2333
1:54:31,42 --> 1:54:34,68
for pesticides and hydrocarbons in general.


2334
1:54:34,68 --> 1:54:37,64
This is the future of industrial food cultivation:


2335
1:54:37,64 --> 1:54:40,36
efficient, clean and abundant.


2336
1:54:40,36 --> 1:54:43,44
So, such advanced systems would be, in part,


2337
1:54:43,44 --> 1:54:46,0
what comprise our agricultural belt,


2338
1:54:46,0 --> 1:54:49,68
producing all the food required for the entire city's population


2339
1:54:49,68 --> 1:54:52,68
with no need to import anything from the outside,


2340
1:54:52,68 --> 1:54:56,44
saving time, waste and energy.


2341
1:54:56,44 --> 1:54:58,42
And speaking of Energy,


2342
1:54:58,42 --> 1:55:0,77
the Energy Belt would work in a systems approach


2343
1:55:0,77 --> 1:55:4,44
to extract electricity from our abundant renewable mediums-


2344
1:55:4,44 --> 1:55:8,9
specifically wind, solar, geothermal and heat differentials-


2345
1:55:8,9 --> 1:55:12,68
and if near water potentials- tidal and wave power.


2346
1:55:12,68 --> 1:55:14,86
To avoid intermittency and make sure


2347
1:55:14,86 --> 1:55:17,28
a positive net energy return occurs,


2348
1:55:17,28 --> 1:55:20,28
these mediums would operate in an integrated system


2349
1:55:20,28 --> 1:55:22,35
powering each other when needed,


2350
1:55:22,35 --> 1:55:26,5
while storing excessive energy to large super capacitors


2351
1:55:26,5 --> 1:55:29,99
under the ground, so nothing can go to waste.


2352
1:55:29,99 --> 1:55:29,24
.


2353
1:55:29,24 --> 1:55:31,64
And not only does the city power itself,


2354
1:55:31,64 --> 1:55:34,94
particular structures will also power independently


2355
1:55:34,94 --> 1:55:38,6
and generate electricity through photovoltaic paints,


2356
1:55:38,6 --> 1:55:41,65
structural pressure transducers, the thermocouple effect,


2357
1:55:41,65 --> 1:55:45,56
and other current but underutilized technologies.


2358
1:55:45,56 --> 1:55:47,68
But of course, this begs the question:


2359
1:55:47,68 --> 1:55:50,15
How does this technology, and goods in general,


2360
1:55:50,15 --> 1:55:52,12
get created in the first place?


2361
1:55:52,12 --> 1:55:54,4
This bring us to Production:


2362
1:55:54,4 --> 1:55:57,45
The Industrial Belt, apart from having hospitals and the like,


2363
1:55:57,45 --> 1:55:59,64
would be the hub of factory production.


2364
1:55:59,64 --> 1:56:1,72
Completely localized overall,


2365
1:56:1,72 --> 1:56:3,55
it would, of course, obtain raw materials


2366
1:56:3,55 --> 1:56:7,52
by way of the global resource management system just discussed,


2367
1:56:7,52 --> 1:56:12,12
with demand being generated by the population of the city itself.


2368
1:56:12,12 --> 1:56:14,28
As far as the mechanics of production,


2369
1:56:14,28 --> 1:56:17,36
we need to discuss a new, powerful phenomenon


2370
1:56:17,36 --> 1:56:20,2
which was sparked very recently in human history


2371
1:56:20,2 --> 1:56:23,52
and is on pace to changing everything.


2372
1:56:23,52 --> 1:56:25,56
It's called Mechanization


2373
1:56:25,56 --> 1:56:28,15
or the automation of labor.


2374
1:56:28,15 --> 1:56:30,9
Well, if you look around, you'll notice that


2375
1:56:30,9 --> 1:56:36,939
almost everything that we use today is built automatically.


2376
1:56:36,939 --> 1:56:37,4
.


2377
1:56:37,4 --> 1:56:42,36
Your shoes, your clothes, your home appliances, your car and so on...


2378
1:56:42,36 --> 1:56:48,76
they are all built by machines in an automatic way.


2379
1:56:48,76 --> 1:56:52,3
Can we say that the society has not been influenced


2380
1:56:52,3 --> 1:56:56,24
by these major technological advancements?


2381
1:56:56,24 --> 1:56:57,72
Of course not.


2382
1:56:57,72 --> 1:57:2,44
These systems really dictate new structures


2383
1:57:2,44 --> 1:57:7,88
and new needs and they make a lot of other things obsolete.


2384
1:57:7,88 --> 1:57:12,7
So, we have been going up in the development


2385
1:57:12,7 --> 1:57:16,32
and use of technology in an exponential way.


2386
1:57:16,32 --> 1:57:20,0
So, definitely automation is going to continue.


2387
1:57:20,0 --> 1:57:24,28
You cannot stop technologies that just make sense.


2388
1:57:24,28 --> 1:57:27,72
Labor automation through technology is at the bottom


2389
1:57:27,72 --> 1:57:31,16
of every major social transformation in human history.


2390
1:57:31,16 --> 1:57:34,57
From the agricultural revolution and the invention of the plow,


2391
1:57:34,57 --> 1:57:38,0
to the industrial revolution and the invention of the powered machine,


2392
1:57:38,0 --> 1:57:40,92
to the information age we live in now,


2393
1:57:40,92 --> 1:57:42,32
through essentially the invention


2394
1:57:42,32 --> 1:57:45,0
of advanced electronics and computers.


2395
1:57:45,0 --> 1:57:48,12
And with regard to advanced production methods today


2396
1:57:48,12 --> 1:57:51,8
mechanization is now evolving on its own:


2397
1:57:51,8 --> 1:57:53,52
moving away from the traditional method


2398
1:57:53,52 --> 1:57:56,56
of assembling component parts into a configuration,


2399
1:57:56,56 --> 1:57:58,95
into an advanced method of creating


2400
1:57:58,95 --> 1:58:2,2
entire products in one single process.


2401
1:58:2,2 --> 1:58:5,92
Like most engineers, I'm fascinated by biology because it is


2402
1:58:5,92 --> 1:58:11,9
so full of examples of extraordinary pieces of engineering.


2403
1:58:11,9 --> 1:58:16,32
What biology is - is the study of things that copy themselves.


2404
1:58:16,32 --> 1:58:18,6
As good a definition of life as we've got.


2405
1:58:18,6 --> 1:58:20,35
Again, as an engineer, I have always been intrigued


2406
1:58:20,35 --> 1:58:23,16
by the idea of machines copying themselves.


2407
1:58:23,16 --> 1:58:25,8
RepRap is a three-dimensional printer -


2408
1:58:25,8 --> 1:58:29,24
that's to say it is a printer that you plug into your computer and


2409
1:58:29,24 --> 1:58:32,5
instead of making 2-dimensional sheets of paper with patterns on,


2410
1:58:32,5 --> 1:58:35,69
it makes real, physical, 3-dimensional objects.


2411
1:58:35,69 --> 1:58:37,58
Now there's nothing new about that.


2412
1:58:37,58 --> 1:58:40,3
3D printers have been around for about 30 years.


2413
1:58:40,3 --> 1:58:45,12
The big thing about RepRap is that it prints most of its own parts.


2414
1:58:45,12 --> 1:58:47,83
So, if you've got one, you could make another one


2415
1:58:47,83 --> 1:58:50,0
and give it to a friend as well as being able to print


2416
1:58:50,0 --> 1:58:51,6
lots of useful things.


2417
1:58:51,6 --> 1:58:55,23
From the simple printing of basic household goods in your home


2418
1:58:55,23 --> 1:58:58,96
to the printing of an entire automobile body in one swoop,


2419
1:58:58,96 --> 1:59:1,85
advanced, automated 3D printing now has the potential


2420
1:59:1,85 --> 1:59:5,3
to transform virtually every field of production,


2421
1:59:5,3 --> 1:59:7,56
including home construction.


2422
1:59:7,56 --> 1:59:13,199
Contour Crafting is actually a fabrication technology-


2423
1:59:13,199 --> 1:59:13,2
.


2424
1:59:13,2 --> 1:59:16,89
the so-called 3D printing- when you directly build


2425
1:59:16,89 --> 1:59:20,68
3D objects from a computer model.


2426
1:59:20,68 --> 1:59:23,85
Using Contour Crafting, it will be possible


2427
1:59:23,85 --> 1:59:26,93
to build a 2000 square-foot home


2428
1:59:26,93 --> 1:59:31,2
entirely by the machine, in one day.


2429
1:59:31,2 --> 1:59:36,5
The reason that people are interested in automating construction


2430
1:59:36,5 --> 1:59:39,6
is that it really brings a lot of benefits.


2431
1:59:39,6 --> 1:59:43,6
For example, construction is pretty labor-intensive.


2432
1:59:43,6 --> 1:59:49,64
And although it provides jobs for a sector of the society


2433
1:59:49,64 --> 1:59:54,95
it also has issues and complications.


2434
1:59:54,95 --> 1:59:59,68
For example, construction is the most dangerous job that there is.


2435
1:59:59,68 --> 2:0:2,9
It is worse than mining and agriculture,


2436
2:0:2,9 --> 2:0:7,52
that has the highest level of fatality in almost every country.


2437
2:0:7,52 --> 2:0:10,24
Another issue is the waste.


2438
2:0:10,24 --> 2:0:15,52
An average home in the United States has 3 to 7 tons of waste.


2439
2:0:15,52 --> 2:0:21,36
So this is huge if we look at the impact of construction,


2440
2:0:21,36 --> 2:0:24,765
and knowing about 40% of all materials in the world


2441
2:0:24,765 --> 2:0:27,88
are used in construction.


2442
2:0:27,88 --> 2:0:31,52
So, a big waste of energy and resources


2443
2:0:31,52 --> 2:0:34,44
and big damage to the environment as well.


2444
2:0:34,44 --> 2:0:39,4
Making homes using hammers and nails and wood


2445
2:0:39,4 --> 2:0:43,8
with the state of our technology today, is really absurd


2446
2:0:43,8 --> 2:0:47,0
and will go the way of our labor class


2447
2:0:47,0 --> 2:0:50,52
in regards to manufacturing in the United States.


2448
2:0:50,52 --> 2:0:56,38
Recently, there was a study by economist David Autor of MIT,


2449
2:0:56,38 --> 2:1:0,295
that states that our middle class is obsolete


2450
2:1:0,295 --> 2:1:3,68
and being replaced by automation.


2451
2:1:3,68 --> 2:1:6,98
Quite simply, Mechanization is more productive,


2452
2:1:6,98 --> 2:1:9,88
efficient and sustainable than human labor


2453
2:1:9,88 --> 2:1:13,0
in virtually every sector of the economy today.


2454
2:1:13,0 --> 2:1:16,6
Machines do not need vacations, breaks, insurance, pensions,


2455
2:1:16,6 --> 2:1:19,6
and they can work 24 hours a day, everyday.


2456
2:1:19,6 --> 2:1:22,2
The output potential and accuracy


2457
2:1:22,2 --> 2:1:25,6
compared to human labor, is unmatched.


2458
2:1:25,6 --> 2:1:29,5
The bottom line: repetitive human labor is becoming obsolete


2459
2:1:29,5 --> 2:1:31,68
and impractical across the world.


2460
2:1:31,68 --> 2:1:35,45
And the unemployment you see around you today is fundamentally


2461
2:1:35,45 --> 2:1:39,899
the result of this evolution of efficiency in technology.


2462
2:1:39,899 --> 2:1:40,5
.


2463
2:1:40,5 --> 2:1:43,96
For years, market economists have dismissed this growing pattern


2464
2:1:43,96 --> 2:1:47,2
which could be called “Technological Unemployment”,


2465
2:1:47,2 --> 2:1:49,72
because of the fact that new sectors always seemed


2466
2:1:49,72 --> 2:1:52,88
to emerge to re-absorb the displaced workers.


2467
2:1:52,88 --> 2:1:56,12
Today, the service sector is the only real hub left


2468
2:1:56,12 --> 2:1:59,86
and currently employs over 80% of the American workforce


2469
2:1:59,86 --> 2:2:4,15
with most industrialized countries maintaining a similar proportion.


2470
2:2:4,15 --> 2:2:7,8
However, this sector is now being challenged increasingly


2471
2:2:7,8 --> 2:2:11,0
by automated kiosks, automated restaurants,


2472
2:2:11,0 --> 2:2:13,12
and even automated stores.


2473
2:2:13,12 --> 2:2:15,35
Economists today are finally acknowledging


2474
2:2:15,35 --> 2:2:17,6
what they had been denying for years:


2475
2:2:17,6 --> 2:2:20,92
Not only is technological unemployment exacerbating


2476
2:2:20,92 --> 2:2:23,65
the current labor crisis we see across the world


2477
2:2:23,65 --> 2:2:26,35
due to the global economic downturn,


2478
2:2:26,35 --> 2:2:28,6
but the more the recession deepens


2479
2:2:28,6 --> 2:2:31,16
the faster the industries are mechanizing.


2480
2:2:31,16 --> 2:2:33,12
The catch, which is not realized,


2481
2:2:33,12 --> 2:2:36,0
is that the faster they mechanize to save money-


2482
2:2:36,0 --> 2:2:37,76
the more they displace people-


2483
2:2:37,76 --> 2:2:41,0
the more they reduce public purchasing power.


2484
2:2:41,0 --> 2:2:43,0
This means that, while the corporation


2485
2:2:43,0 --> 2:2:44,9
can produce everything more cheaply,


2486
2:2:44,9 --> 2:2:48,6
fewer and fewer people will actually have money to buy anything


2487
2:2:48,6 --> 2:2:51,4
regardless of how cheap they become.


2488
2:2:51,4 --> 2:2:54,45
The bottom line is that the “labor for income” game


2489
2:2:54,45 --> 2:2:56,9
is slowly coming to an end.


2490
2:2:56,9 --> 2:2:59,28
In fact, if you take a moment to reflect


2491
2:2:59,28 --> 2:3:1,68
on the jobs which are in existence today


2492
2:3:1,68 --> 2:3:5,52
which automation could take over right now if applied,


2493
2:3:5,52 --> 2:3:7,98
75% of the global workforce


2494
2:3:7,98 --> 2:3:11,56
could be replaced by mechanization tomorrow.


2495
2:3:11,56 --> 2:3:14,88
And this is why, in a Resource-Based Economy,


2496
2:3:14,88 --> 2:3:17,64
there is no Monetary-Market system.


2497
2:3:17,64 --> 2:3:19,8
No money at all...


2498
2:3:19,8 --> 2:3:21,4
for there is no need.


2499
2:3:21,4 --> 2:3:22,88
A Resource-Based Economy


2500
2:3:22,88 --> 2:3:26,5
recognizes the efficiency of mechanization


2501
2:3:26,5 --> 2:3:27,8
and accepts it for what it offers.


2502
2:3:27,8 --> 2:3:30,56
It doesn't fight it, like we do today.


2503
2:3:30,56 --> 2:3:33,12
Why? Because it is irresponsible not to,


2504
2:3:33,12 --> 2:3:38,24
given any interest in efficiency and sustainability.


2505
2:3:38,24 --> 2:3:41,16
And this brings us back to our city system.


2506
2:3:41,16 --> 2:3:44,1
In the center is the Central Dome, which not only houses


2507
2:3:44,1 --> 2:3:44,25
.


2508
2:3:44,25 --> 2:3:47,64
the educational facilities and transportation hub,


2509
2:3:47,64 --> 2:3:49,5
it also hosts the mainframe


2510
2:3:49,5 --> 2:3:52,4
that runs the cities technical operations.


2511
2:3:52,4 --> 2:3:56,0
The city is, in fact, one big automated machine.


2512
2:3:56,0 --> 2:3:58,0
It has sensors in all technical belts


2513
2:3:58,0 --> 2:3:59,88
to track the progress of agriculture,


2514
2:3:59,88 --> 2:4:4,12
energy gathering, production, distribution and the like.


2515
2:4:4,12 --> 2:4:7,0
Now, would people be needed to oversee these operations


2516
2:4:7,0 --> 2:4:9,6
in the event of a malfunction or the like?


2517
2:4:9,6 --> 2:4:11,3
Most probably: yes.


2518
2:4:11,3 --> 2:4:15,99
But that number would decrease over time as improvements continue.


2519
2:4:15,99 --> 2:4:15,24
.


2520
2:4:15,24 --> 2:4:19,2
However, as of today, maybe 3% of the city population


2521
2:4:19,2 --> 2:4:21,999
would be needed for this job when you break it down.


2522
2:4:21,999 --> 2:4:22,0
.


2523
2:4:22,0 --> 2:4:26,49
And I can assure you: that in an economic system


2524
2:4:26,49 --> 2:4:26,5
.


2525
2:4:26,5 --> 2:4:28,52
which is actually designed to take care of you


2526
2:4:28,52 --> 2:4:31,951
and secure your well being, without you having to submit


2527
2:4:31,951 --> 2:4:32,1
.


2528
2:4:32,1 --> 2:4:35,32
to a private dictatorship on a daily basis


2529
2:4:35,32 --> 2:4:38,42
usually to a job that is either technically unnecessary


2530
2:4:38,42 --> 2:4:40,6
or socially pointless,


2531
2:4:40,6 --> 2:4:43,85
while often struggling with debt that doesn't exist


2532
2:4:43,85 --> 2:4:45,8
just to make ends meet...


2533
2:4:45,8 --> 2:4:50,44
I guarantee you: people will volunteer their time left and right


2534
2:4:50,44 --> 2:4:57,79
to maintain and improve a system that actually takes care of them.


2535
2:4:57,79 --> 2:4:57,8
.


2536
2:4:57,8 --> 2:5:0,28
And coupled with this issue of 'Incentive'


2537
2:5:0,28 --> 2:5:2,1
comes the common assumption


2538
2:5:2,1 --> 2:5:4,34
that if there isn't some external pressure


2539
2:5:4,34 --> 2:5:6,8
for one to “work for a living”


2540
2:5:6,8 --> 2:5:9,42
people would just sit around, do nothing


2541
2:5:9,42 --> 2:5:12,18
and turn into fat lazy blobs.


2542
2:5:12,18 --> 2:5:14,495
This is nonsense.


2543
2:5:14,495 --> 2:5:16,5
The labor system we have today


2544
2:5:16,5 --> 2:5:22,39
is in fact the generator of laziness, not a resolver of it.


2545
2:5:22,39 --> 2:5:22,12
.


2546
2:5:22,12 --> 2:5:24,38
If you think back to when you were a child-


2547
2:5:24,38 --> 2:5:27,6
full of life, interested in new things to understand,


2548
2:5:27,6 --> 2:5:29,84
likely creating and exploring...


2549
2:5:29,84 --> 2:5:32,2
But as time went on, the system pushed you


2550
2:5:32,2 --> 2:5:36,28
into the focus of figuring out how to make money.


2551
2:5:36,28 --> 2:5:38,4
And from early education,


2552
2:5:38,4 --> 2:5:41,1
to study at a university, you are narrowed.


2553
2:5:41,1 --> 2:5:45,189
Only to emerge as a creature which serves as a cog in a wheel


2554
2:5:45,189 --> 2:5:45,19
.


2555
2:5:45,19 --> 2:5:49,24
in a model that sends all the fruits to the upper 1%.


2556
2:5:49,24 --> 2:5:52,58
Scientific Studies have now shown that people are, in fact,


2557
2:5:52,58 --> 2:5:55,1
not motivated by monetary reward


2558
2:5:55,1 --> 2:5:57,8
when it comes to ingenuity and creation.


2559
2:5:57,8 --> 2:6:0,98
The creation itself is the reward.


2560
2:6:0,98 --> 2:6:3,74
Money, in fact, appears only to serve as an incentive


2561
2:6:3,74 --> 2:6:6,24
for repetitive, mundane actions


2562
2:6:6,24 --> 2:6:10,7
a role we have just now shown can be replaced by machine.


2563
2:6:10,7 --> 2:6:14,998
So when it comes to innovation- the actual use of the human mind-


2564
2:6:14,998 --> 2:6:15,0
.


2565
2:6:15,0 --> 2:6:17,7
the monetary incentive has proven to be a hindrance,


2566
2:6:17,7 --> 2:6:21,26
interfering and detracting from creative thought.


2567
2:6:21,26 --> 2:6:24,43
And this might explain why Nikola Tesla, the Wright Brothers,


2568
2:6:24,43 --> 2:6:28,249
and other inventors who contributed massively to our current world


2569
2:6:28,249 --> 2:6:28,35
.


2570
2:6:28,35 --> 2:6:31,7
never showed a monetary incentive to do so.


2571
2:6:31,7 --> 2:6:35,36
Money is, in fact, a false incentive


2572
2:6:35,36 --> 2:6:42,99
and causes 100 times more distortion than it does contribution.


2573
2:6:42,99 --> 2:6:42,12
.


2574
2:6:42,12 --> 2:6:44,9
Good morning class. Please settle down.


2575
2:6:44,9 --> 2:6:48,6
The first thing I would like to do is go around the room


2576
2:6:48,6 --> 2:6:51,82
and ask what everyone would like to be when they grow up.


2577
2:6:51,82 --> 2:6:54,14
Who would like to go first?


2578
2:6:54,14 --> 2:6:56,4
Okay, how about you Sarah?


2579
2:6:56,4 --> 2:7:0,98
When I grow up I want to work at McDonald's like my mom!


2580
2:7:0,98 --> 2:7:3,68
Oh, family tradition, eh?


2581
2:7:3,68 --> 2:7:5,66
How about you, Linda?


2582
2:7:5,66 --> 2:7:8,2
When I grow up, I'm going to be a prostitute


2583
2:7:8,2 --> 2:7:11,24
on the streets of New York City!


2584
2:7:11,24 --> 2:7:15,0
Oh! glamour girl, huh? Very ambitious.


2585
2:7:15,0 --> 2:7:15,12
.


2586
2:7:15,12 --> 2:7:16,94
How about you, Tommy?


2587
2:7:16,94 --> 2:7:20,52
When I grow up, I'm going to be a rich, elitist businessman


2588
2:7:20,52 --> 2:7:22,5
who works on Wall Street and profits


2589
2:7:22,5 --> 2:7:22,6
.


2590
2:7:22,6 --> 2:7:25,3
off of the collapse of foreign economies.


2591
2:7:25,3 --> 2:7:30,999
Enterprising... and great to see some multicultural interest!


2592
2:7:30,999 --> 2:7:31,6
.


2593
2:7:31,6 --> 2:7:33,7
[Victims of Culture]


2594
2:7:33,7 --> 2:7:36,39
As stated before, a Resource-Based Economy


2595
2:7:36,39 --> 2:7:40,14
applies the Scientific Method to social concern


2596
2:7:40,14 --> 2:7:43,52
and this isn't limited to simply technical efficiency.


2597
2:7:43,52 --> 2:7:45,75
It also has the consideration of human


2598
2:7:45,75 --> 2:7:49,62
and social well-being directly and what comprises it.


2599
2:7:49,62 --> 2:7:52,14
What good is a social system if, in the end,


2600
2:7:52,14 --> 2:7:56,2
it doesn't produce happiness and peaceful coexistence?


2601
2:7:56,2 --> 2:7:58,16
So, it is important to point out


2602
2:7:58,16 --> 2:8:0,3
that with the removal of the money system


2603
2:8:0,3 --> 2:8:2,62
and the necessities of life provided


2604
2:8:2,62 --> 2:8:5,4
we would see a global reduction in crime


2605
2:8:5,4 --> 2:8:8,3
by about 95% almost immediately-


2606
2:8:8,3 --> 2:8:12,1
for there is nothing to steal, embezzle, scam, or the like.


2607
2:8:12,1 --> 2:8:14,96
95% of all people in prisons today are there


2608
2:8:14,96 --> 2:8:18,4
due to some monetary related crime or drug abuse


2609
2:8:18,4 --> 2:8:23,32
and drug abuse is a disorder- not a crime.


2610
2:8:23,32 --> 2:8:26,939
So what about the other 5%?, the truly violent...


2611
2:8:26,939 --> 2:8:27,0
.


2612
2:8:27,0 --> 2:8:29,45
often seeming to some as being violent


2613
2:8:29,45 --> 2:8:31,24
for the sake of being violent...


2614
2:8:31,24 --> 2:8:35,8
are they just “evil” people?


2615
2:8:35,8 --> 2:8:40,42
The reason that I frankly think it's a waste of time


2616
2:8:40,42 --> 2:8:46,3
to engage in moral value judgments about people's violence


2617
2:8:46,3 --> 2:8:46,301
.


2618
2:8:46,301 --> 2:8:50,46
is because it doesn't advance by one iota


2619
2:8:50,46 --> 2:8:53,7
our understanding of either the causes


2620
2:8:53,7 --> 2:8:57,76
or the prevention of the violent behavior.


2621
2:8:57,76 --> 2:9:2,36
People sometimes ask if I believe in “forgiving” criminals.


2622
2:9:2,36 --> 2:9:4,32
My answer to that is


2623
2:9:4,32 --> 2:9:7,34
“No, I don't believe in forgiveness


2624
2:9:7,34 --> 2:9:10,28
anymore than I believe in condemnation.”


2625
2:9:10,28 --> 2:9:13,0
It's only if we, as a society,


2626
2:9:13,0 --> 2:9:16,2
can take the same attitude of treating violence


2627
2:9:16,2 --> 2:9:19,82
as a problem in public health and preventive medicine


2628
2:9:19,82 --> 2:9:23,0
rather than as a moral "evil"...


2629
2:9:23,0 --> 2:9:25,2
It's only when we make that change


2630
2:9:25,2 --> 2:9:28,25
in our own attitudes and assumptions and values


2631
2:9:28,25 --> 2:9:32,8
that we will actually succeed in reducing the level of violence


2632
2:9:32,8 --> 2:9:36,759
rather than stimulating it, which is what we do now.


2633
2:9:36,759 --> 2:9:36,76
.


2634
2:9:36,76 --> 2:9:39,96
The more justice you seek, the more hurt you become


2635
2:9:39,96 --> 2:9:41,9
because there's no such thing as justice.


2636
2:9:41,9 --> 2:9:46,16
There is whatever there is out there. That's it.


2637
2:9:46,16 --> 2:9:50,8
In other words, if people are conditioned to be racist bigots-


2638
2:9:50,8 --> 2:9:53,2
if they are brought up in an environment that advocates that-


2639
2:9:53,2 --> 2:9:55,2
why do you blame the person for it?


2640
2:9:55,2 --> 2:9:58,24
They are a victim of a subculture.


2641
2:9:58,24 --> 2:10:0,4
Therefore they have to be helped.


2642
2:10:0,4 --> 2:10:3,8
The point is, we have to redesign the environment


2643
2:10:3,8 --> 2:10:7,579
that produces aberrant behavior. That's the problem.


2644
2:10:7,579 --> 2:10:7,58
.

2:10:7,58 --> 2:10:9,7
Not putting a person in jail.


2646
2:10:9,7 --> 2:10:13,8
That's why judges, lawyers, “freedom of choice”-


2647
2:10:13,8 --> 2:10:16,8
such concepts are dangerous!


2648
2:10:16,8 --> 2:10:19,75
Because it gives you mis-information


2649
2:10:19,75 --> 2:10:23,48
that the person is “bad”, or that person is a “serial killer”.


2650
2:10:23,48 --> 2:10:25,5
Serial killers are made


2651
2:10:25,5 --> 2:10:30,28
just like soldiers become serial killers with a machine gun.


2652
2:10:30,28 --> 2:10:32,1
They become killing machines,


2653
2:10:32,1 --> 2:10:35,38
but nobody looks at them as murderers or assassins


2654
2:10:35,38 --> 2:10:37,32
because that's “natural”.


2655
2:10:37,32 --> 2:10:39,24
So we blame people.


2656
2:10:39,24 --> 2:10:42,32
We say, “Well, this guy was a Nazi- he tortured Jews.”


2657
2:10:42,32 --> 2:10:45,4
No, he was brought up to torture Jews.


2658
2:10:45,4 --> 2:10:49,9
Once you accept the fact that people have individual choices


2659
2:10:49,9 --> 2:10:52,3
and they are free to make those choices- ...


2660
2:10:52,3 --> 2:10:55,919
Free to make choices means without being influenced.


2661
2:10:55,919 --> 2:10:55,92
.


2662
2:10:55,92 --> 2:10:58,24
And I can't understand that at all.


2663
2:10:58,24 --> 2:11:2,22
All of us are influenced in all of our choices


2664
2:11:2,22 --> 2:11:5,12
by the culture we live in, by our parents


2665
2:11:5,12 --> 2:11:7,4
and by the values that dominate.


2666
2:11:7,4 --> 2:11:11,1
So we're influenced- so there can't be “free” choices.


2667
2:11:11,1 --> 2:11:13,78
'What's the greatest country in the world?' - the true answer:

'I haven't been all over the world and I don't know enough


2669

And why do you think that those are the only options?


2715
2:13:43,0 --> 2:13:46,2
All of those political constructs were created by writers

that the dominant intellectual culture


2740
2:14:48,77 --> 2:14:51,65

2:17:19,7 --> 2:17:23,34
blocking maximization of turning money


2795
2:17:23,34 --> 2:17:27,62
into more money for private money possessors.


2796
2:17:27,62 --> 2:17:29,75
That's it. Every other thing they'll say:


2797
2:17:29,75 --> 2:17:31,48
'Oh, we need more commodities for people';


2798
2:17:31,48 --> 2:17:35,64
'Oh, this is freedom against tyranny' and so forth,


2799
2:17:35,64 --> 2:17:38,8
every time you see it, you can decode it down to that.


2800
2:17:38,8 --> 2:17:41,14
And I think you'll find a one-to-one correlation


2801
2:17:41,14 --> 2:17:42,78
with every time they use it.


2802
2:17:42,78 --> 2:17:45,68
And this, in a sense, in which we might call- ...


2803
2:17:45,68 --> 2:17:50,82
It's a Syntax. A governing syntax of understanding and of value.


2804
2:17:50,82 --> 2:17:53,8
So it governs beneath their own recognition of it.


2805
2:17:53,8 --> 2:17:56,24
So they might say: 'Oh, I didn't mean that at all!'


2806
2:17:56,24 --> 2:17:58,16
but in fact, that's what they do.


2807
2:17:58,16 --> 2:18:0,2
Just like you may speak a grammar


2808
2:18:0,2 --> 2:18:1,86
and you have rules of grammar you follow


2809
2:18:1,86 --> 2:18:4,36
without recognizing what the rules are...


2810
2:18:4,36 --> 2:18:8,44
and so what we have is what I call the “Ruling Value Syntax”


2811
2:18:8,44 --> 2:18:11,72
that underlies this. So, every time they use these words:


2812
2:18:11,72 --> 2:18:15,2
'government interference'; 'lack of freedom' or 'freedom'


2813
2:18:15,2 --> 2:18:17,8
or 'progress' or 'development'


2814
2:18:17,8 --> 2:18:22,9
you can decode them all to come back to mean that.


2815
2:18:22,9 --> 2:18:25,64
Of course, when you hear the word 'freedom'


2816
2:18:25,64 --> 2:18:30,199
it tends to be in same sentence with something called 'democracy'.


2817
2:18:30,199 --> 2:18:30,24
.


2818
2:18:30,24 --> 2:18:33,16
It's fascinating how people today seem to believe


2819
2:18:33,16 --> 2:18:35,35
that they actually have a relevant influence


2820
2:18:35,35 --> 2:18:37,599
on what their government does,


2821
2:18:37,599 --> 2:18:40,4
forgetting that the very nature of our system


2822
2:18:40,4 --> 2:18:42,88
offers everything for sale.


2823
2:18:42,88 --> 2:18:45,68
The only vote that counts is the monetary vote


2824
2:18:45,68 --> 2:18:47,75
and it doesn't matter how much any activist


2825
2:18:47,75 --> 2:18:50,68
yells about ethics and accountability.


2826
2:18:50,68 --> 2:18:54,6
In a market system, every politician, every legislation


2827
2:18:54,6 --> 2:18:58,0
and hence, every government- is for sale.


2828
2:18:58,0 --> 2:19:3,52
And even with the $20 trillion bank bailouts starting in 2007-


2829
2:19:3,52 --> 2:19:3,64
.


2830
2:19:3,64 --> 2:19:6,25
an amount of money which could have changed say,


2831
2:19:6,25 --> 2:19:10,399
the global energy infrastructure to fully renewable methods-


2832
2:19:10,399 --> 2:19:10,44
.


2833
2:19:10,44 --> 2:19:12,4
instead going to a series of institutions


2834
2:19:12,4 --> 2:19:15,0
that literally do nothing to help society,


2835
2:19:15,0 --> 2:19:19,599
institutions that could be removed tomorrow with no recourse...


2836
2:19:19,599 --> 2:19:19,6
.


2837
2:19:19,6 --> 2:19:23,38
the blind conditioning that politics and politicians


2838
2:19:23,38 --> 2:19:28,0
exist for the public well-being still continues.


2839
2:19:28,0 --> 2:19:31,12
The fact is, politics is a business,


2840
2:19:31,12 --> 2:19:34,8
no different than any other in a market system,


2841
2:19:34,8 --> 2:19:38,4
and they care about their self-interest before anything else.


2842
2:19:38,4 --> 2:19:42,68
I don't really, honestly, deep down believe in political action.


2843
2:19:42,68 --> 2:19:45,85
I think the system contracts and expands as it wants to.


2844
2:19:45,85 --> 2:19:47,72
It accommodates these changes.


2845
2:19:47,72 --> 2:19:50,0
I think the civil rights movement was an accommodation


2846
2:19:50,0 --> 2:19:52,28
on the part of those who own the country.


2847
2:19:52,28 --> 2:19:55,12
I think they see where their self-interest lies;


2848
2:19:55,12 --> 2:19:57,88
they see a certain amount of freedom seems good


2849
2:19:57,88 --> 2:20:1,1
-an illusion of liberty- give these people a voting day every year


2850
2:20:1,1 --> 2:20:4,2
so that they will have the illusion of meaningless choice.


2851
2:20:4,2 --> 2:20:7,6
Meaningless choice- that we go, like slaves and say


2852
2:20:7,6 --> 2:20:10,5
“Oh, I Voted.” The limits of debate in this country


2853
2:20:10,5 --> 2:20:12,45
are established before the debate even begins


2854
2:20:12,45 --> 2:20:14,8
and everyone else is marginalized and made to seem


2855
2:20:14,8 --> 2:20:17,76
either to be communist or some sort of disloyal person-


2856
2:20:17,76 --> 2:20:19,56
a “kook- there's a word...


2857
2:20:19,56 --> 2:20:21,98
and now it's “conspiracy”. See- they made that


2858
2:20:21,98 --> 2:20:24,99
something that should not be even entertained for a minute:


2859
2:20:24,99 --> 2:20:27,85
that powerful people might get together and have a plan!


2860
2:20:27,85 --> 2:20:33,64
Doesn't happen! You're a “kook”! You're a “conspiracy buff”!


2861
2:20:33,64 --> 2:20:37,12
And of all the mechanisms of defense of this system


2862
2:20:37,12 --> 2:20:40,12
there are two that repeatedly come up.


2863
2:20:40,12 --> 2:20:43,78
The first is this idea that the system has been the “cause”


2864
2:20:43,78 --> 2:20:47,15
of the material progress we have seen on this planet.


2865
2:20:47,15 --> 2:20:49,16
Well...No.


2866
2:20:49,16 --> 2:20:51,3
There are basically two root causes


2867
2:20:51,3 --> 2:20:54,75
which have created the increased so-called “wealth”


2868
2:20:54,75 --> 2:20:57,6
and population growth we see today.


2869
2:20:57,6 --> 2:21:1,5
One: the exponential advancement of production technology;


2870
2:21:1,5 --> 2:21:4,7
hence scientific ingenuity.


2871
2:21:4,7 --> 2:21:8,84
And Two: the initial discovery of abundant hydrocarbon energy-


2872
2:21:8,84 --> 2:21:13,48
which is currently the foundation of the entire socio-economic system.


2873
2:21:13,48 --> 2:21:16,42
The free-market / capitalist / monetary market system


2874
2:21:16,42 --> 2:21:17,66
- whatever you want to call it -


2875
2:21:17,66 --> 2:21:21,34
has done nothing but ride the wave of these advents


2876
2:21:21,34 --> 2:21:24,85
with a distorted incentive system and a haphazard


2877
2:21:24,85 --> 2:21:30,44
grossly unequal method of utilizing and distributing those fruits.


2878
2:21:30,44 --> 2:21:33,95
The second defense is a belligerent social bias


2879
2:21:33,95 --> 2:21:36,27
generated from years of propaganda


2880
2:21:36,27 --> 2:21:38,7
which sees any other social system


2881
2:21:38,7 --> 2:21:41,34
as a route to so called "tyranny”


2882
2:21:41,34 --> 2:21:45,0
with various name droppings of Stalin, Mao, Hitler,


2883
2:21:45,0 --> 2:21:47,2
and the death tolls they generated.


2884
2:21:47,2 --> 2:21:50,3
Well, as despotic as these men might have been


2885
2:21:50,3 --> 2:21:53,7
along with the societal approaches they perpetuated,


2886
2:21:53,7 --> 2:21:55,9
when it comes to the game of death-


2887
2:21:55,9 --> 2:21:57,71
when comes to the systematic


2888
2:21:57,71 --> 2:22:0,4
daily mass murder of human beings-


2889
2:22:0,4 --> 2:22:4,92
nothing in history compares to what we have today.


2890
2:22:4,92 --> 2:22:10,38
Famines- throughout at least the last century of our history-


2891
2:22:10,38 --> 2:22:12,92
have not been caused by a lack of food.


2892
2:22:12,92 --> 2:22:16,12
They have been caused by relative poverty.


2893
2:22:16,12 --> 2:22:20,48
The economic resources were so inequitably distributed


2894
2:22:20,48 --> 2:22:23,76
that the poor simply didn't have enough money


2895
2:22:23,76 --> 2:22:26,3
with which to buy the food that would've been


2896
2:22:26,3 --> 2:22:29,56
available if they could have afforded to pay for it.


2897
2:22:29,56 --> 2:22:32,36
That would be an example of Structural Violence.


2898
2:22:32,36 --> 2:22:37,16
Another example: in Africa and other areas-


2899
2:22:37,16 --> 2:22:39,76
I'll particularly focus on Africa-


2900
2:22:39,76 --> 2:22:42,8
tens of millions of people are dying of AIDS.


2901
2:22:42,8 --> 2:22:44,68
Why are they dying?


2902
2:22:44,68 --> 2:22:47,35
It's not because we don't know how to treat AIDS.


2903
2:22:47,35 --> 2:22:51,28
We have millions of people in the wealthy countries


2904
2:22:51,28 --> 2:22:54,0
getting along remarkably well


2905
2:22:54,0 --> 2:22:57,35
because they have the medicines that will treat it.


2906
2:22:57,35 --> 2:22:59,36
The people in Africa who are dying of AIDS


2907
2:22:59,36 --> 2:23:3,2
are not dying because of the HIV virus.


2908
2:23:3,2 --> 2:23:5,44
They are dying because they don't have the money


2909
2:23:5,44 --> 2:23:7,3
with which to pay for the drugs


2910
2:23:7,3 --> 2:23:9,13
that would keep them alive.


2911
2:23:9,13 --> 2:23:11,6
Gandhi saw this. He said:


2912
2:23:11,6 --> 2:23:16,24
“The deadliest form of violence is poverty.”


2913
2:23:16,24 --> 2:23:18,8
And that's absolutely right.


2914
2:23:18,8 --> 2:23:23,8
Poverty kills far more people than all the wars in history,


2915
2:23:23,8 --> 2:23:25,64
more people than all the murderers in history,


2916
2:23:25,64 --> 2:23:28,68
more than all the suicides in history.


2917
2:23:28,68 --> 2:23:32,18
Not only does Structural Violence kill more people


2918
2:23:32,18 --> 2:23:35,36
than all the Behavioral Violence put together,


2919
2:23:35,36 --> 2:23:40,299
Structural Violence is also the main cause of Behavioral Violence.


2920
2:23:40,299 --> 2:23:42,84
.


2921
2:23:42,84 --> 2:23:46,64
[ Beyond the Peak ]


2922
2:23:46,64 --> 2:23:50,65
Oil is the foundation of


2923
2:23:50,65 --> 2:23:55,6
and is present throughout, the edifice of human civilization.


2924
2:23:55,6 --> 2:23:58,91
There are 10 calories of hydrocarbon energy– oil and natural gas–


2925
2:23:58,91 --> 2:24:3,95
in every calorie of food you and I eat in the industrialized world.


2926
2:24:3,95 --> 2:24:6,7
Fertilizers are made from natural gas.


2927
2:24:6,7 --> 2:24:8,76
Pesticides are made from oil.


2928
2:24:8,76 --> 2:24:10,56
You drive oil-powered machines to plant, plow,


2929
2:24:10,56 --> 2:24:13,4
irrigate, harvest, transport, package.


2930
2:24:13,4 --> 2:24:16,82
You wrap the food in plastic– that's oil. All plastic is oil.


2931
2:24:16,82 --> 2:24:19,5
There are 7 gallons of oil in every tire.


2932
2:24:19,5 --> 2:24:23,24
Oil is everywhere; it's ubiquitous. And it's only because of oil


2933
2:24:23,24 --> 2:24:25,0
that there are 7 billion people or almost


2934
2:24:25,0 --> 2:24:27,92
7 billion people on this planet right now.


2935
2:24:27,92 --> 2:24:30,4
The arrival of this cheap and easy energy


2936
2:24:30,4 --> 2:24:32,0
which is equivalent, by the way,


2937
2:24:32,0 --> 2:24:36,2
to billions of slaves working around the clock,


2938
2:24:36,2 --> 2:24:40,6
changed the world in such a radical way over the last century


2939
2:24:40,6 --> 2:24:43,5
and the population has gone up 10 times.


2940
2:24:43,5 --> 2:24:48,4
But by 2050, oil supply is able to support


2941
2:24:48,4 --> 2:24:50,7
less than half the present world's population


2942
2:24:50,7 --> 2:24:52,2
in their present way of life.


2943
2:24:52,2 --> 2:24:57,54
So, the scale of adjustment to live differently is just enormous.


2944
2:24:57,54 --> 2:25:1,4
The world is now using 6 barrels of oil for every barrel it finds.


2945
2:25:1,4 --> 2:25:3,8
Five years ago it was using 4 barrels of oil


2946
2:25:3,8 --> 2:25:5,42
for every barrel it finds.


2947
2:25:5,42 --> 2:25:7,9
A year from now it is going to be using 8 barrels of oil


2948
2:25:7,9 --> 2:25:9,52
for every barrel of oil it finds.


2949
2:25:9,52 --> 2:25:13,59
What's disturbing to me is the lack of any real effort


2950
2:25:13,59 --> 2:25:16,14
from governments worldwide


2951
2:25:16,14 --> 2:25:20,0
and industry leaders worldwide to do something different.


2952
2:25:20,0 --> 2:25:24,26
We have these, sort of, attempts to build more wind power


2953
2:25:24,26 --> 2:25:26,72
and to maybe do something with Tide...


2954
2:25:26,72 --> 2:25:31,2
we've got attempts to make our cars a little bit more efficient.


2955
2:25:31,2 --> 2:25:34,51
But there's nothing which really looks like a revolution coming along;


2956
2:25:34,51 --> 2:25:38,399
these are all pretty minor, and that I think is pretty frightening.


2957
2:25:38,399 --> 2:25:38,4
.


2958
2:25:38,4 --> 2:25:42,24
And the governments who are driven by these economists


2959
2:25:42,24 --> 2:25:45,27
who don't really appreciate what we're talking about


2960
2:25:45,27 --> 2:25:50,4
are trying to stimulate consumerism to restore past prosperity


2961
2:25:50,4 --> 2:25:52,76
in the hope that they can restore the past.


2962
2:25:52,76 --> 2:25:56,72
They're printing yet more money lacking any collateral at all.


2963
2:25:56,72 --> 2:25:59,85
So, if the economy improves and recovers


2964
2:25:59,85 --> 2:26:2,85
and the famous growth comes back, it will only be short-lived


2965
2:26:2,85 --> 2:26:6,45
because within a short period of time,


2966
2:26:6,45 --> 2:26:8,7
counted in months rather than years,


2967
2:26:8,7 --> 2:26:11,12
it will hit the supply barrier again;


2968
2:26:11,12 --> 2:26:13,95
there will be another price shock and a deeper recession.


2969
2:26:13,95 --> 2:26:16,749
So I think we go into a series of vicious circles.


2970
2:26:16,749 --> 2:26:16,85
.


2971
2:26:16,85 --> 2:26:18,3
So you have the economic growth going up


2972
2:26:18,3 --> 2:26:21,2
-price spike- everything shuts down. That's where we are now.


2973
2:26:21,2 --> 2:26:25,33
Then it starts to come up again but what we have now is this area


2974
2:26:25,33 --> 2:26:28,47
where there's no more ability to produce cheap energy.


2975
2:26:28,47 --> 2:26:31,72
We're at the peak- we're on the down slope of oil production.


2976
2:26:31,72 --> 2:26:35,48
No way you're going to get any more out of the ground any faster


2977
2:26:35,48 --> 2:26:39,35
which means that things shut down, the price of oil drops


2978
2:26:39,35 --> 2:26:45,2
which it did in early 2009 but then as you have a “recovery”


2979
2:26:45,2 --> 2:26:47,12
the price of oil starts to come back.


2980
2:26:47,12 --> 2:26:49,85
It's recently been hovering at about $80 a barrel


2981
2:26:49,85 --> 2:26:52,38
and what we see is that at even at $80 a barrel now,


2982
2:26:52,38 --> 2:26:54,2
with the financial and economic collapse,


2983
2:26:54,2 --> 2:26:56,2
people are having a hard time affording that.


2984
2:26:56,2 --> 2:27:0,84
World oil production right now is about 86 million barrels a day.


2985
2:27:0,84 --> 2:27:6,96
Over 10 years, you're looking at roughly 14 million barrels a day


2986
2:27:6,96 --> 2:27:8,82
having to be replaced.


2987
2:27:8,82 --> 2:27:12,5
There's nothing around which can come even


2988
2:27:12,5 --> 2:27:15,3
within 1% of meeting that sort of demand.


2989
2:27:15,3 --> 2:27:17,52
If we don't do something pretty quickly


2990
2:27:17,52 --> 2:27:20,92
there's going to be a huge energy deficiency.


2991
2:27:20,92 --> 2:27:26,49
I think the big mistake is in not recognizing a decade or so ago


2992
2:27:26,49 --> 2:27:29,7
that a concerted effort needed to be made


2993
2:27:29,7 --> 2:27:31,721
to develop these sustainable forms of energy.


2994
2:27:31,721 --> 2:27:31,87

2995
2:27:31,87 --> 2:27:33,55

2996
2:27:33,55 --> 2:27:37,64

2997

3000
2:27:49,0 --> 2:27:51,12
For the first time in human history


3001
2:27:51,12 --> 2:27:55,1
the species is now faced with the depletion of a core resource


3002
2:27:55,1 --> 2:27:57,39
central to our current system of survival.


3003
2:27:57,39 --> 2:27:59,1
And the punchline of the whole thing


3004
2:27:59,1 --> 2:28:2,4
is that even with oil becoming more scarce


3005
2:28:2,4 --> 2:28:5,51
the economic system will still blindly push


3006
2:28:5,51 --> 2:28:7,51
its cancerous growth model,


3007
2:28:7,51 --> 2:28:10,72
so people can go out and buy more oil powered cars


3008
2:28:10,72 --> 2:28:16,8
to generate GDP and jobs, exacerbating the decline.


3009
2:28:16,8 --> 2:28:18,6
Are there solutions to replace the edifice


3010
2:28:18,6 --> 2:28:21,349
of the hydrocarbon economy? Of course.


3011
2:28:21,349 --> 2:28:21,5
.


3012
2:28:21,5 --> 2:28:24,12
But the path needed to accomplish these changes


3013
2:28:24,12 --> 2:28:28,6
will not manifest through the Market System Protocols required


3014
2:28:28,6 --> 2:28:31,8
since new solutions can only be implemented


3015
2:28:31,8 --> 2:28:33,96
through the Profit Mechanism.


3016
2:28:33,96 --> 2:28:35,9
People are not investing in renewable energies


3017
2:28:35,9 --> 2:28:39,74
because there is no money in it in both long and short term.


3018
2:28:39,74 --> 2:28:42,4
And the commitment needed to make it happen


3019
2:28:42,4 --> 2:28:45,72
can only occur at a severe financial loss.


3020
2:28:45,72 --> 2:28:49,18
Therefore, there is no monetary incentive and in this system,


3021
2:28:49,18 --> 2:28:53,64
if there is no monetary incentive, things do not happen.


3022
2:28:53,64 --> 2:28:54,71
And on top of it all,


3023
2:28:54,71 --> 2:28:58,29
Peak Oil is just one of many surfacing consequences


3024
2:28:58,29 --> 2:29:3,12
of the environmental-social train wreck gaining speed today.


3025
2:29:3,12 --> 2:29:4,86
Other declines include fresh water


3026

3028
2:29:11,251 --> 2:29:11,4
.


3029
2:29:11,4 --> 2:29:16,36
and those shortages are on pace to reach 4 billion by 2030.


3030
2:29:16,36 --> 2:29:17,97
Food Production:


3031
2:29:17,97 --> 2:29:19,81
The destruction of arable crop land,


3032
2:29:19,81 --> 2:29:24,58
from which 99.7% of all human food comes from today


3033
2:29:24,58 --> 2:29:29,4
is occurring up to 40 times faster than it is being replenished.


3034
2:29:29,4 --> 2:29:32,52
And over the last 40 years, 30% of the arable land


3035
2:29:32,52 --> 2:29:34,52
has become unproductive.


3036
2:29:34,52 --> 2:29:36,25
Not to mention that hydrocarbons


3037
2:29:36,25 --> 2:29:38,96
are the backbone of agriculture today


3038
2:29:38,96 --> 2:29:42,68
and, as it declines, so will the food supply.


3039
2:29:42,68 --> 2:29:44,52
As far as resources in general,


3040
2:29:44,52 --> 2:29:46,4
at our current patterns of consumption,


3041
2:29:46,4 --> 2:29:51,27
by 2030 we will need 2 planets to continue our rates.

3046
2:30:0,75 --> 2:30:2,64
And with all of these declines


3047
2:30:2,64 --> 2:30:5,34
we have the near exponential population growth


3048

where by 2030 there might be over 8 billion people on this planet.

2:30:10,639 --> 2:30:10,8
.


3050
2:30:10,8 --> 2:30:14,92
Energy production alone would need to increase 44%


3051
2:30:14,92 --> 2:30:17,9
by 2030 to meet such demand.


3052
2:30:17,9 --> 2:30:21,89
And again- since money is the only initiator of action,


3053
2:30:21,89 --> 2:30:24,6
are we to expect that any country on the planet


3054
2:30:24,6 --> 2:30:27,5
