0:0:59,9 --> 0:1:5,22
n the last lecture we were talking about some
mathematical models for facility location.


2
0:1:5,22 --> 0:1:14,8
Today we are going to be talking about the
problem of layout planning. If you recall,


3
0:1:14,8 --> 0:1:19,9
the hierarchy of location problems is the
next important problem where the objective


4
0:1:19,9 --> 0:1:27,41
is to determine the related positioning of
different departments. In this lecture we


5
0:1:27,41 --> 0:1:35,28
look at the basic issues that are involved
in the layout planning exercise. We shall


6
0:1:35,28 --> 0:1:48,96
look at a generic procedure known as systematic
layout planning to develop a layout of a plant.


7
0:1:48,96 --> 0:1:55,95
What are the objectives in plant layout? When
you develop a layout for a manufacturing plant,


8
0:1:55,95 --> 0:1:57,91
what are the typical objectives?


9
0:1:57,91 --> 0:2:5,569
There could be many objectives some of them
are listed on this slide for instance one


10
0:2:5,569 --> 0:2:12,5
objective could be to minimize the investment
and equipment. Somebody might say how layout


11
0:2:12,5 --> 0:2:17,18
will influence the investment in equipment?


12
0:2:17,18 --> 0:2:22,28
Obviously if you do not duplicate equipment
and you have a streamline layout then you


13
0:2:22,28 --> 0:2:27,78
could minimize the investment and equipment.
The layout has considerable effect on the


14
0:2:27,78 --> 0:2:38,9
investment in equipment. It also helps you
to minimize the overall production time. You


15
0:2:38,9 --> 0:2:48,349
can utilize the existing space most effectively
with proper layout. A proper layout should


16
0:2:48,349 --> 0:2:58,68
provide for employee convenience safety and
comfort. You should try to maintain flexibility


17
0:2:58,68 --> 0:3:11,64
of arrangement. Layout generally tries to
minimize the material handling cost. It also


18
0:3:11,64 --> 0:3:18,569
tries to minimize the variation in types of
material handling equipment for instance a


19
0:3:18,569 --> 0:3:25,11
good layout could try to standardize the kind
of material handling equipment that it uses,


20
0:3:25,11 --> 0:3:30,719
for instance you do not expect forklift trolleys
of very different sizes to operate in the


21
0:3:30,719 --> 0:3:40,68
same shop floor, you could expect standardize
equipment. Generally the plant layout could


22
0:3:40,68 --> 0:3:49,67
facilitate the manufacturing process and it
could also facilitate the organizational structure,


23
0:3:49,67 --> 0:3:55,459
because what could happen is that you are
trying to place different kinds of equipment


24
0:3:55,459 --> 0:4:2,629
and trying to segregate different types of
operations. Therefore it will tend to facilitate


25
0:4:2,629 --> 0:4:11,26
the organization structure as well. Let us
have a brief idea about different types of


26
0:4:11,26 --> 0:4:14,54
layouts.


27
0:4:14,54 --> 0:4:23,14
Brightly speaking we can talk about the product
layout, a process layout or mix of these two,


28
0:4:23,14 --> 0:4:30,87
which is called a mixed layout or the layout
by fixed position. Let us see for instance


29
0:4:30,87 --> 0:4:37,59
as to what are the features of each of these
different types of layouts. The product layout


30
0:4:37,59 --> 0:4:46,99
is essentially one where a product enters
the line and one side and you keep on performing


31
0:4:46,99 --> 0:4:51,94
different operations on the product. Finally
finished products come out in the outside.


32
0:4:51,94 --> 0:4:58,31
So, all assembly lines for instance are typically
examples of product layouts. The idea here


33
0:4:58,31 --> 0:5:5,98
is that the layout is dictated by the product.
Whatever operations are required on the product,


34
0:5:5,98 --> 0:5:12,77
they are laid out in either straight line
or in U mode or in serpentine time mode or


35
0:5:12,77 --> 0:5:18,49
in any other mode but the essential thing
are that all the operations are to be performed


36
0:5:18,49 --> 0:5:24,65
on the product or performed in sequence. From
the raw material you ultimately get the final


37
0:5:24,65 --> 0:5:31,11
product. This is the typical feature of a
product layout. In fact when you are talking


38
0:5:31,11 --> 0:5:36,889
about product layouts you tend to generally
resort to products layouts when the volume


39
0:5:36,889 --> 0:5:47,11
of production is large and for instance and
you have a dedicated product, you are not


40
0:5:47,11 --> 0:5:56,28
changing the product design that frequently.
Another kind of layout is a process layout.


41
0:5:56,28 --> 0:6:0,509
Essentially a process layout is something
where you have different departments that


42
0:6:0,509 --> 0:6:9,52
are A B C D E F. Each of these departments
houses machine which are similar in character


43
0:6:9,52 --> 0:6:17,25
though these machines are not identical. For
instance A could be all the lathes. So lathes


44
0:6:17,25 --> 0:6:21,889
with different features are in the lathe shop,
this could be a milling shop, this could be


45
0:6:21,889 --> 0:6:28,72
a grinding shop and so on. Each shop has different
types of machines clubbed together and what


46
0:6:28,72 --> 0:6:36,16
happens is that a particular product depending
upon it is requirement will move from one


47
0:6:36,16 --> 0:6:44,41
department to another to another till finally
the product is produced. The major advantage


48
0:6:44,41 --> 0:6:50,9
of this type of layout is the product variety
that it can handle unlike the product layout


49
0:6:50,9 --> 0:6:55,69
which typically handles the single type of
product. You can make a variety of products


50
0:6:55,69 --> 0:7:3,68
in this particular layout and of course what
will be the major problem here? The major


51
0:7:3,68 --> 0:7:8,97
problem obviously is B is large number of
products moving here and there. So there will


52
0:7:8,97 --> 0:7:12,139
be a lot of confusion in terms of movement.


53
0:7:12,139 --> 0:7:19,33
There will be lot of delays as product weight
and move to different departments therefore


54
0:7:19,33 --> 0:7:26,569
the production time generally tend to be large
in such situations. So you could try to have


55
0:7:26,569 --> 0:7:32,84
the situation where you have both the product
and the process layouts mixed, so it is a


56
0:7:32,84 --> 0:7:38,86
mixed layout. Mixed layout is a very common
layout in industry, for instance what could


57
0:7:38,86 --> 0:7:46,3
happen is if you go to a factory like Maruthi
ute for instance, you could find that the


58
0:7:46,3 --> 0:7:53,86
final product is being produced as an assembly
line. So it is a product layout. But the various


59
0:7:53,86 --> 0:7:59,11
components which go into the product are actually
being produced in a process layout in different


60
0:7:59,11 --> 0:8:6,83
shops. So you invariably have a mixture of
both the product and the process layout in


61
0:8:6,83 --> 0:8:15,289
various organizations. Of course one can also
talk about a cellular layout or a group layout


62
0:8:15,289 --> 0:8:22,99
which is something that is generally suited
to a situation where you have a predictable


63
0:8:22,99 --> 0:8:31,96
variety of products to make and the idea is
that you try to group products into product


64
0:8:31,96 --> 0:8:38,909
families, part into part families and these
individual parts are part family is then subjected


65
0:8:38,909 --> 0:8:49,0
to processing in individual cells. The basic
idea is that in a cell, the processing sequences


66
0:8:49,0 --> 0:8:55,5
are almost uniform, so the modification behind
the cellular layout is that we try to get


67
0:8:55,5 --> 0:9:4,49
advantages of both product layout and process
layouts, that means you get the variety of


68
0:9:4,49 --> 0:9:10,83
the process layout and you try to get the
speeds by this grouping of parts which are


69
0:9:10,83 --> 0:9:16,75
all then processed in various kinds of cell.


70
0:9:16,75 --> 0:9:22,48
Then we talk about layout by fixed position.
In a layout by fixed position what happens


71
0:9:22,48 --> 0:9:29,18
is that the layout is determined by the size
of the product, for instance this is true


72
0:9:29,18 --> 0:9:34,98
for special structures of a ship building
or for assembly of an aircraft depending upon


73
0:9:34,98 --> 0:9:40,63
the type of the aircraft, you have different
machines, different pupil keep coming and


74
0:9:40,63 --> 0:9:47,48
moving. In all these cases what was happening
was that the job was moving and the machines


75
0:9:47,48 --> 0:9:53,5
was stationary here. The job is stationary
and the machines are moving. There is really


76
0:9:53,5 --> 0:9:57,6
not much to choose as far as the layout is
concerned, this is governed by the shape of


77
0:9:57,6 --> 0:10:3,69
the product itself. If you are building a
ship, the shape of the ship it itself will


78
0:10:3,69 --> 0:10:7,71
dictate the layout and machines will come
do the welding operations of the riveting


79
0:10:7,71 --> 0:10:18,54
operations and go back. Then somebody else
will do the painting and this is what it is.


80
0:10:18,54 --> 0:10:26,44
We are looking at this layout design problem.
It is important to note how this problem is


81
0:10:26,44 --> 0:10:33,6
actually affected by other decisions pertaining
to the product, the schedule and the process.


82
0:10:33,6 --> 0:10:38,95
You see that the layout design problem which
we are trying to a address is governed by


83
0:10:38,95 --> 0:10:45,93
the product design, the process design and
the schedule design. The product design means


84
0:10:45,93 --> 0:10:54,68
what you have to make that determines the
layout. How you have to make it means the


85
0:10:54,68 --> 0:10:59,49
process that you have selected for making
the product. So this will term in the various


86
0:10:59,49 --> 0:11:6,5
machines and equipment that you need. Schedule
design which talks about how much you need


87
0:11:6,5 --> 0:11:11,9
to make. So this is essentially a decision
that comes from marketing forecasting of the


88
0:11:11,9 --> 0:11:18,7
man which tells you how much how many pieces
you need per day. The product process and


89
0:11:18,7 --> 0:11:27,84
schedule constitutes the basic information
that you need for layout design. Mind you


90
0:11:27,84 --> 0:11:31,96
it is not only layout design which is linked
to this but these decisions in and sales are


91
0:11:31,96 --> 0:11:36,62
also related to each other. To call the choice
of the product will also determine what process


92
0:11:36,62 --> 0:11:44,56
to take. Choice of the process will also determine
the schedule that you have to follow and so


93
0:11:44,56 --> 0:11:52,31
on. So in the layout design process, we are
here primarily talking about the layout of


94
0:11:52,31 --> 0:12:0,0
process layout. In the layout design process,
you need inputs from the product, the process


95
0:12:0,0 --> 0:12:12,82
and the schedule that is the important thing.
If you try to compare for instance what could


96
0:12:12,82 --> 0:12:18,81
be the features of a product layout in this
category? You find what is the product layout?


97
0:12:18,81 --> 0:12:24,59
Product layout is a situation where the input
is some raw material and it is being processed


98
0:12:24,59 --> 0:12:31,29
in different works station and sequence till
finally the final product comes out here.


99
0:12:31,29 --> 0:12:37,85
So in a situation like this you have smooth
and logical flow lines. You need to have very


100
0:12:37,85 --> 0:12:43,4
small in process inventories because the part
which is processed here will immediately go


101
0:12:43,4 --> 0:12:48,5
to the next machine, so there has to be very
little in process inventory here.


102
0:12:48,5 --> 0:12:55,39
Total production time per unit is short. There
is a reduced material handling because the


103
0:12:55,39 --> 0:12:59,55
parts directly move from one workstation to
the other. So it does not have to be transported


104
0:12:59,55 --> 0:13:6,12
in trolleys and tracks to other departments.
There is little operator skill and the training


105
0:13:6,12 --> 0:13:15,0
is therefore simple production, planning and
control and there is less space for work in


106
0:13:15,0 --> 0:13:27,15
transit and temporary storage. These are some
of the features of a product layout.


107
0:13:27,15 --> 0:13:33,43
Let us look at the process layout. Now what
is our basic concern in this particular session?


108
0:13:33,43 --> 0:13:42,96
A process layout is a collection of departments
A B C D E F which are housed in maybe different


109
0:13:42,96 --> 0:13:51,13
rooms or different buildings. Therefore the
advantages are there is better utilization


110
0:13:51,13 --> 0:13:58,67
of machines, hence fewer machines and needed.
Why this is happening is because here you


111
0:13:58,67 --> 0:14:4,64
have a lathe that is a special purpose lathe.
So all jobs which require processing on that


112
0:14:4,64 --> 0:14:9,86
special purpose lathe will come here and get
the processing done and go away. Whereas if


113
0:14:9,86 --> 0:14:15,5
the same thing was to be done in a product
layout, you will have to duplicate the machine


114
0:14:15,5 --> 0:14:17,8
at whatever operation it came.


115
0:14:17,8 --> 0:14:21,86
If you need a lathe here, after ten operations
you require the same lathe, you duplicate.


116
0:14:21,86 --> 0:14:26,96
So generally, better utilization of machines
and fewer machines are needed in a process


117
0:14:26,96 --> 0:14:34,27
layout. There is a high degree of flexibility
with regard to equipment or manpower allocation


118
0:14:34,27 --> 0:14:41,45
for specific tasks. What this means is if
a job comes to a department of the milling


119
0:14:41,45 --> 0:14:45,98
machine, there is often a choice. It can be
put in either machine 1 or machine 2 or machine


120
0:14:45,98 --> 0:14:51,21
3 because they are all capable of doing the
operation. It can be given to definitive operators


121
0:14:51,21 --> 0:14:56,63
depending upon their skills. You have this
flexibility with regard to both equipment


122
0:14:56,63 --> 0:15:3,8
and manpower allocation for specific tasks.
Comparatively low investment in machine is


123
0:15:3,8 --> 0:15:10,12
required, this follows from one. There is
greater job satisfaction for the operator.


124
0:15:10,12 --> 0:15:16,6
Why is there a greater job satisfaction for
the operator because the operator who is working


125
0:15:16,6 --> 0:15:22,22
in a particular department during the day
handles variety of jobs, different types of


126
0:15:22,22 --> 0:15:28,8
jobs unlike an operator who is working on
a product layout, who could be sitting on


127
0:15:28,8 --> 0:15:35,69
a machine and operating a pedal. So you operate
a pedal maybe 250 times a day and that is


128
0:15:35,69 --> 0:15:39,11
the end it is life.


129
0:15:39,11 --> 0:15:43,69
Here there is greater job satisfaction for
the operator and specialized supervision is


130
0:15:43,69 --> 0:15:50,38
also possible here. Why specialized supervision?
because the supervisor for the lathe section


131
0:15:50,38 --> 0:15:55,3
nearly spent 10 years in the lathe section
and become a supervisor and in our knows the


132
0:15:55,3 --> 0:16:0,79
ins and outs of all the machines which are
there in this particular shop. If you talk


133
0:16:0,79 --> 0:16:7,94
about the product layout on a line there are
different machines manufactured by different


134
0:16:7,94 --> 0:16:12,51
manufactures and having different features.
It is impossible for one particular individual


135
0:16:12,51 --> 0:16:16,69
to be an expert of all those machines. The
kind of supervision that he will be able to


136
0:16:16,69 --> 0:16:36,28
give is only general and not specialized.
However the process layout has some limitations


137
0:16:36,28 --> 0:16:43,55
and we should be aware of those limitations.
Since longer flow lines usually result, material


138
0:16:43,55 --> 0:16:48,23
handling is more expensive. Obviously a part
has to go from here to here. It has the first


139
0:16:48,23 --> 0:16:52,12
weight then somebody has to load it on to
a trolley and then the trolley has to go.


140
0:16:52,12 --> 0:16:55,76
The trolley may weigh in that department;
somebody unloads it and so on.


141
0:16:55,76 --> 0:17:4,14
So longer flow line used result material handling
is more expensive. In fact the general objective


142
0:17:4,14 --> 0:17:10,669
function in designing a layout of this type
is one of the major objectives to minimize


143
0:17:10,669 --> 0:17:18,47
the material handling cost. Production planning
and control systems are more involved in such


144
0:17:18,47 --> 0:17:24,559
systems. Total production time is usually
longer. Large in process inventories take


145
0:17:24,559 --> 0:17:32,19
place because material might be stored up
in different departments without being processed.


146
0:17:32,19 --> 0:17:40,559
Space and capital are tied up by work in processes
and because of the diversity of jobs in specialized


147
0:17:40,559 --> 0:17:47,2
departments, higher grades of skill are required.
This is also another feature because quite


148
0:17:47,2 --> 0:17:52,77
often if you need somebody to operate a grinding
machine, you could at least expect that he


149
0:17:52,77 --> 0:18:1,419
has done an ITI diploma and has put in three
years therefore he can undertake to operate


150
0:18:1,419 --> 0:18:7,96
such machines. All these operators operating
this machine would generally be pupil who


151
0:18:7,96 --> 0:18:16,659
have higher grades of skill unlike an operator
on a product line because on a product line,


152
0:18:16,659 --> 0:18:23,409
if you even select a man from the street,
all you has to do is to press a pedal 250


153
0:18:23,409 --> 0:18:29,779
times and that practice can be given to him
in half a day and therefore training people


154
0:18:29,779 --> 0:18:34,21
and product for operating product layout is
generally much easier whereas here it will


155
0:18:34,21 --> 0:18:47,1
be much more difficult. Let us look at this
chart which is called a P-Q chart and essentially


156
0:18:47,1 --> 0:18:50,44
what we have said is consider a situation
where we have to make a large number of products,


157
0:18:50,44 --> 0:18:59,24
P is the product variety and we arrange these
products in the descending order of the quantity


158
0:18:59,24 --> 0:19:5,59
that you need. What really happens is that
this product is the first one to be made in


159
0:19:5,59 --> 0:19:11,49
large quantity. This product is to be made
in lesser quantity and so on. So we have products


160
0:19:11,49 --> 0:19:17,409
which are arranged in the descending order
of the air quantity. Now this chart which


161
0:19:17,409 --> 0:19:25,679
was suggested by Muether, gives an idea of
the situation under which you should use different


162
0:19:25,679 --> 0:19:31,559
types layouts. For instance what you said
is once you got these products lined like


163
0:19:31,559 --> 0:19:40,61
these, the products which are here, that means
for products for which the varieties low but


164
0:19:40,61 --> 0:19:46,259
the quantities are high, those are the products
for which product layout is more suitable.


165
0:19:46,259 --> 0:19:53,45
I mean you set up assembly line, and on this
end here where you have a large number of


166
0:19:53,45 --> 0:19:59,46
products but the quantities are electively
smaller. So it is a large amount of variety


167
0:19:59,46 --> 0:20:7,1
but low production quantities. This is the
situation where a process layout is recommended


168
0:20:7,1 --> 0:20:12,6
and in between these two categories when you
have intermediate variety and intermediate


169
0:20:12,6 --> 0:20:17,129
production quantity, generally you could use
a combination layout which is the product


170
0:20:17,129 --> 0:20:27,5
of these. The idea here is only to give you
an overall intuitive feel when a product layout


171
0:20:27,5 --> 0:20:34,789
and process layout should be selected. Product
layout is most appropriate when you are having


172
0:20:34,789 --> 0:20:39,74
less number of products to produce in large
quantities and the process layout is used


173
0:20:39,74 --> 0:20:48,8
when you have large variety but to be produced
in small quantities. This summarizes the features


174
0:20:48,8 --> 0:20:58,36
of product and process layouts in that sense.
Let us now look at the process of designing


175
0:20:58,36 --> 0:21:4,679
a process layout. Normally when you talk about
layout planning we are generally talking only


176
0:21:4,679 --> 0:21:10,999
about process layouts because product layout
is generally fixed by the sequence of operation.


177
0:21:10,999 --> 0:21:15,749
So, there is nothing much to design except
to ensure that you have the space to layout


178
0:21:15,749 --> 0:21:17,45
those machines.


179
0:21:17,45 --> 0:21:25,499
There is a procedure which is called systematic
layout planning SLP. SLP procedure of Muether


180
0:21:25,499 --> 0:21:35,57
was proposed way back in 1961 where we gave
a general framework for how these process


181
0:21:35,57 --> 0:21:43,74
layouts are to be designed. You might wonder
as to why a procedure developed so long ago


182
0:21:43,74 --> 0:21:52,21
is still being talk about. You talk about
something when it is still useful. The zero


183
0:21:52,21 --> 0:22:1,49
invented so many years ago is still useful.
But the point here is that the systematic


184
0:22:1,49 --> 0:22:8,889
layout planning procedure of Muether has suddenly
become important because this has now become


185
0:22:8,889 --> 0:22:16,45
the basis for many of the computerized layout
planning algorithms which are available. In


186
0:22:16,45 --> 0:22:25,1
the next class we shall be talking about some
computerized layout planning procedures. Those


187
0:22:25,1 --> 0:22:33,36
procedures are actually base their inputs
and operations on the SLP procedure. We look


188
0:22:33,36 --> 0:22:41,8
at the SLP procedure in this class to understand
what all is required. The first in that required


189
0:22:41,8 --> 0:22:49,47
is to input data and activities. What is the
kind of data or activity that you have to


190
0:22:49,47 --> 0:22:51,649
input for this particular problem?


191
0:22:51,649 --> 0:22:59,49
There are three kinds of data that you need
to input, the product data, the process data


192
0:22:59,49 --> 0:23:10,82
and the scheduled data. The input to the process
of planning a process layout is essentially


193
0:23:10,82 --> 0:23:17,73
inputting this kind of data about the product
the process and schedule and from this input


194
0:23:17,73 --> 0:23:28,149
data the first step that is done is to identify
the flow of material. The second step is to


195
0:23:28,149 --> 0:23:37,159
identify the activity relationship based on
step one and step two. We develop what is


196
0:23:37,159 --> 0:23:48,889
called a relationship diagram and then this
relationship diagram is converted into what


197
0:23:48,889 --> 0:23:54,98
is called as space relationship diagram. In
order to develop the space relationship diagram,


198
0:23:54,98 --> 0:24:1,73
you have to compute in step 4, the space required,
match it with the space available, that means


199
0:24:1,73 --> 0:24:6,96
if you find that the space required is 4000
square feet you must make sure that 4000 square


200
0:24:6,96 --> 0:24:12,82
feet of space is available. So it is just
to check in that direction and then you develop


201
0:24:12,82 --> 0:24:19,889
the space relationship diagram in step six.
This space relationship diagram is then subjected


202
0:24:19,889 --> 0:24:25,87
to modifying considerations and practical
limitations which you may not have considered


203
0:24:25,87 --> 0:24:35,129
in the entire process so for. On the basis
of space to develop the layout alternatives,


204
0:24:35,129 --> 0:24:39,69
you evaluate these alternatives and pickup
the best layout alternative that you have.


205
0:24:39,69 --> 0:24:45,6
So this is the brad framework and it is a
very systematic framework for a problem like


206
0:24:45,6 --> 0:24:52,169
designing a layout. You can see that you can
divide this framework into three different


207
0:24:52,169 --> 0:25:0,99
phases. Up to here is the phase of analysis,
up to step five is the phase of analysis,


208
0:25:0,99 --> 0:25:7,169
where your analyzing your data, finding out
the flow of material activity relationships,


209
0:25:7,169 --> 0:25:15,59
depending upon the activity relationship diagram,
the space required and the space available.


210
0:25:15,59 --> 0:25:23,9
Once the analysis part is over you search
for the solutions. So from the space relationship


211
0:25:23,9 --> 0:25:29,85
diagram, you are developing layout alternatives,
so you are searching for alternatives solution


212
0:25:29,85 --> 0:25:34,929
and then once you have searched you have developed
these solutions, you have to identify which


213
0:25:34,929 --> 0:25:43,269
is the best so it is the selection of the
solution. Search followed by selection, preceded


214
0:25:43,269 --> 0:25:51,35
by analysis is the general order of this particular
algorithm. The one reason why it is popular


215
0:25:51,35 --> 0:25:57,619
is that it provides a framework for intensive
exactly what is to be done. When you are developing


216
0:25:57,619 --> 0:26:1,6
computer program you must tell the computer
exactly what is to be done and that is why


217
0:26:1,6 --> 0:26:9,289
this framework has been used in layout planning
exercise. This is the SLP procedure of muether.


218
0:26:9,289 --> 0:26:15,7
We will try to illustrate this procedure to
a sample problem so that you get an idea of


219
0:26:15,7 --> 0:26:31,11
what exact or how the layout operations can
be done. Just to give you a feel if we are


220
0:26:31,11 --> 0:26:37,659
to organize production as a product layout
essentially what it means is that you have


221
0:26:37,659 --> 0:26:39,679
to start from the raw materials stage.


222
0:26:39,679 --> 0:26:46,8
You have different types of products. You
go to the saw department, you go to the milling


223
0:26:46,8 --> 0:26:52,279
department, you come to inspection one and
then do this operation here and then final


224
0:26:52,279 --> 0:26:58,8
operation here and you come out and similarly
what we are trying to say is every departments


225
0:26:58,8 --> 0:27:4,21
which are laid out core also be laid out so
that you are trying to facilitate a product


226
0:27:4,21 --> 0:27:18,22
layout for three different product. Now we
in this particular scheme of things have essentially


227
0:27:18,22 --> 0:27:20,57
used these three symbols.


228
0:27:20,57 --> 0:27:25,909
The circle represents an operation being done
like machining operation or mettle removal


229
0:27:25,909 --> 0:27:34,159
or grinding whatever a square represents and
inspection and a inverted triangle of this


230
0:27:34,159 --> 0:27:42,97
nature represents storage. This is a convenient
way of representing the types of operations


231
0:27:42,97 --> 0:27:49,769
which are required here. Let us assume that
we have a process layout for the same thing,


232
0:27:49,769 --> 0:27:55,11
so what we have is, we have these different
departments, raw materials, storage, saw department,


233
0:27:55,11 --> 0:28:2,9
where saw is done of the material, the lathe
department, the drilling department, the milling


234
0:28:2,9 --> 0:28:6,33
department, the inspection the packing and
finish goods and here again we have different


235
0:28:6,33 --> 0:28:11,279
products which we try to move. So these products
move according to their needs. There is a


236
0:28:11,279 --> 0:28:15,269
lot of criss crossing so typically this is
the kind of thing it happens in a process


237
0:28:15,269 --> 0:28:26,19
layout.


238
0:28:26,19 --> 0:28:30,49
These crosses I think are supposed to be the
centralized of these individual departments,


239
0:28:30,49 --> 0:28:37,1
if your raw material stored, this is the center.
If this is the one, these are the centers.


240
0:28:37,1 --> 0:28:43,369
We need them later. Let us suppose that we
are trying to work on this particular process


241
0:28:43,369 --> 0:28:48,629
layout and we are maybe trying to evaluate
this process layout. We are trying to find


242
0:28:48,629 --> 0:28:57,389
a better layout by using SLP. We will see
how we can do that. So the operation could


243
0:28:57,389 --> 0:29:4,139
be something like this. This is out input
data for the problem. We are saying essentially


244
0:29:4,139 --> 0:29:12,649
that they are three products A, B and C which
we want to manufacture and the processing


245
0:29:12,649 --> 0:29:19,32
sequence of these products is this first goes
to saw, then mill then inspect then turn,


246
0:29:19,32 --> 0:29:26,59
then mill, then drill then inspect then package
and similarly for this and similarly for this


247
0:29:26,59 --> 0:29:31,249
that means we know for each product the processing
sequenc


248
0:29:31,249 --> 0:29:35,179
We know the information pertaining to the
product, what is the product and how it is


249
0:29:35,179 --> 0:29:41,57
going to be processed? Product and the process
information is available to us for these three


250
0:29:41,57 --> 0:29:52,119
products, then we would also like to know
the schedule information to how much is the


251
0:29:52,119 --> 0:30:0,71
demand for each of these products. What my
happen is that these products may be considerable


252
0:30:0,71 --> 0:30:6,739
in size, this maybe a small costing, this
maybe a much bigger thing, this maybe a smaller


253
0:30:6,739 --> 0:30:8,29
thing and so on.


254
0:30:8,29 --> 0:30:16,35
In order to take care of that aspect we are
simply standardizing the material flow required


255
0:30:16,35 --> 0:30:21,419
in the plant to pallet loads per day, that
means how many trolley loads per day will


256
0:30:21,419 --> 0:30:26,309
be needed? What we are saying is that as far
as product is concerned we required eight


257
0:30:26,309 --> 0:30:35,549
pallet loads per day in terms of production.
This might be something like 160 products


258
0:30:35,549 --> 0:30:41,149
or whatever it is. We are talking in terms
of pallet loads. Similarly B requires 3 pallet


259
0:30:41,149 --> 0:30:46,499
loads which maybe 300 components so whatever
could be different and C could be five pallet


260
0:30:46,499 --> 0:30:52,57
loads per day, so we are using a common unit
for measuring the material handling of these


261
0:30:52,57 --> 0:30:59,279
products throughout the plant. This is essentially
our schedule requirement. Firstly, how many


262
0:30:59,279 --> 0:31:7,39
trolley loads of A, B, C must be produce per
day in the factory? We need information about


263
0:31:7,39 --> 0:31:19,379
the processing the products the processing
and the quantities. This is the input to it.


264
0:31:19,379 --> 0:31:23,399
What we are going to do is we are going to
actually construct what is called a from-to


265
0:31:23,399 --> 0:31:38,769
chart 
and from-to chart is actually a convenient
means of reducing a large volume of data into


266
0:31:38,769 --> 0:31:42,619
a workable form.


267
0:31:42,619 --> 0:31:49,159
By inspecting the data displayed in the from-to
chart the layout analyst can identify the


268
0:31:49,159 --> 0:32:1,919
departments having large volumes of movement.
So let us try to do it for our example,


269
0:32:1,919 --> 0:32:15,96
What we find here is let us say we construct
this information, from-to chart is actually


270
0:32:15,96 --> 0:32:24,749
a square matrix. In the matrix we have listed
all the departments, raw materials, saw lathe,


271
0:32:24,749 --> 0:32:30,59
drill mill inspection packaging and finish
goods, and same departments here and so on.


272
0:32:30,59 --> 0:32:35,619
What we are trying to basically find out is
what is the total movement from this to this


273
0:32:35,619 --> 0:32:41,739
so it is a from-to chart it is very much like
a distance chart, which is say what are the


274
0:32:41,739 --> 0:32:48,49
distances from one pair of cities to another
pair of cities? For instance what you find


275
0:32:48,49 --> 0:32:56,97
is everything begins from the raw materials
stage, so you have the total movement which


276
0:32:56,97 --> 0:33:1,83
will take place form raw material to saw.


277
0:33:1,83 --> 0:33:9,69
What you are saying is let us look at this
requirement. This product A will go from raw


278
0:33:9,69 --> 0:33:15,809
material to saw C, will also go from raw material
to saw, but B will go from raw material to


279
0:33:15,809 --> 0:33:21,549
drill, it does not go to saw, so as far as
this is concerned product A and C will make


280
0:33:21,549 --> 0:33:26,659
a movement from raw material to saw and you
can easily find out what is the total movement


281
0:33:26,659 --> 0:33:33,559
of raw materials of product A and C. So A
trolleys are moving and C is five trolley


282
0:33:33,559 --> 0:33:39,679
loads are moving, so 8 + 5 is 13, that how
you get this figure of 13 and similarly for


283
0:33:39,679 --> 0:33:45,739
the other entries in this particular chart.
So it shows that the total movement which


284
0:33:45,739 --> 0:33:52,59
takes place from raw material to saw, 13 daily
they will be 13 trolley loads moving from


285
0:33:52,59 --> 0:33:58,999
raw material to saw and from raw material
to drill 3 will be moving and as far as this


286
0:33:58,999 --> 0:34:5,39
movement is concerned from milling to inspection
16 will be moving and so on. This from- to


287
0:34:5,39 --> 0:34:11,21
charts shows the number of materials handling
trips per day between all the departments.


288
0:34:11,21 --> 0:34:21,669
Now what is the idea? The idea is that those
departments which have a large amount of movement,


289
0:34:21,669 --> 0:34:28,159
especially these departments should be as
close to each other, the layout is possible.


290
0:34:28,159 --> 0:34:33,71
They should be as much as possible, close
to each other and for those departments which


291
0:34:33,71 --> 0:34:44,8
do not have any movement, need not be that
close. So from this from-to chart we can we


292
0:34:44,8 --> 0:34:50,409
can make a common like this. Normally the
from-to chart is used to analyze the flow


293
0:34:50,409 --> 0:34:58,48
in process layouts. The item movement that
occurs over some specified period of time


294
0:34:58,48 --> 0:35:3,88
is totaled for all products and entered in
the from-to chart as shown in the next figure.


295
0:35:3,88 --> 0:35:12,21
What do you like to simply show is this information?


296
0:35:12,21 --> 0:35:23,28
In this figure which is also from-to chart,
the previous chart was total flow or material


297
0:35:23,28 --> 0:35:31,9
handling material flow taking place between
all pairs of departments. This particular


298
0:35:31,9 --> 0:35:39,82
chart is the information pertaining to the
distances between the various departments.


299
0:35:39,82 --> 0:35:44,9
You are asking me about the centers in that
layouts, so if you are now talking about this


300
0:35:44,9 --> 0:35:50,61
layout, we look at the centralized of each
department and find out what is the distance


301
0:35:50,61 --> 0:35:55,52
from the centroid of one department to the
centroid the other departments. On that basis


302
0:35:55,52 --> 0:36:3,2
we can construct a diagram of this nature,
which should show that the raw material to


303
0:36:3,2 --> 0:36:13,98
drill department is 72. Note that the various
distances between all pairs of departments


304
0:36:13,98 --> 0:36:21,12
are listed here. This particular matrix could
be either symmetric but it is not necessary


305
0:36:21,12 --> 0:36:25,75
that it be a symmetric. The distance from
one department to another need not be the


306
0:36:25,75 --> 0:36:30,4
same as the distance from the same department
back to cell if there are unidirectional flows


307
0:36:30,4 --> 0:36:38,42
and so on. If you are permitting all kind
of flows, then this maybe the same. Whatever


308
0:36:38,42 --> 0:36:43,74
be the distances they can be accommodated
and this is the distance matrix, so we have


309
0:36:43,74 --> 0:36:49,52
a flow matrix and we have a distance matrix
which we have constructed. An important thing


310
0:36:49,52 --> 0:36:55,47
to note here is that the distance matrix can
be constructed only if you have a tentative


311
0:36:55,47 --> 0:36:56,59
layout.


312
0:36:56,59 --> 0:37:3,45
So it is for that tentative layout that we
have made the distances, so then what we do


313
0:37:3,45 --> 0:37:12,68
is we multiply the two matrices element by
element. Now we have the total material handling


314
0:37:12,68 --> 0:37:18,49
effect. This is the total loads multiplied
with distance which we had in the previous


315
0:37:18,49 --> 0:37:24,66
matrix. We have two matrices; we multiply
that so this is the total material handling


316
0:37:24,66 --> 0:37:32,38
effect. You will have these entrances here.
We can sum up the rows; you will get 424 which


317
0:37:32,38 --> 0:37:40,34
is the material handling effort. Total material
handling movement from the raw material is


318
0:37:40,34 --> 0:37:49,54
424 units and total material handling movement
to the saw is 208. So this is the to and this


319
0:37:49,54 --> 0:37:59,39
is the from, in terms of total material handling
effort and a zero in a particular column shows


320
0:37:59,39 --> 0:38:6,32
that this is a source and a zero in a particular
row shows that this is the sink, obviously


321
0:38:6,32 --> 0:38:11,15
because what is happening is that everything
flows from the raw materials store. It is


322
0:38:11,15 --> 0:38:17,48
a source, there is nothing coming to it and
the finish goods is last operation. So that


323
0:38:17,48 --> 0:38:24,68
is where you have, and nothing goes out of
it. If you sum up these values, this column


324
0:38:24,68 --> 0:38:35,42
or this row, the total value is 4032. So it
shows that the process layout which we are


325
0:38:35,42 --> 0:38:44,56
at the movement investigating has a total
material handling effort of 4032, this is


326
0:38:44,56 --> 0:38:51,41
significant a development because what have
we done? We have been able to quantify the


327
0:38:51,41 --> 0:38:56,3
material handling movement for a layout and
this is the likely objective function for


328
0:38:56,3 --> 0:39:2,72
that particular layout. We are able to say
that the total material handling effort for


329
0:39:2,72 --> 0:39:10,86
this layout is so much. Clearly we could use
this information to evaluate different layouts.


330
0:39:10,86 --> 0:39:17,55
Plant one, plant two, plant three, each one
we can calculate the distance matrix will


331
0:39:17,55 --> 0:39:24,3
be different the load matrix will be the same.
You will get different material handling figures


332
0:39:24,3 --> 0:39:29,21
which is like the objective function values
and you can choose a particular layout which


333
0:39:29,21 --> 0:39:35,1
in fact has the minimum material handling
effect and in fact this is one of the basic


334
0:39:35,1 --> 0:39:42,71
logic that is provided in the development
of craft which is a computerized relative


335
0:39:42,71 --> 0:39:57,46
allocation of facilities technique which we
can talk about in the next class.


336
0:39:57,46 --> 0:40:5,64
We can plant a layout by following these steps
is something like this. Suppose these are


337
0:40:5,64 --> 0:40:11,64
the departments which are to be placed in
a layout, the foreman office, the conference


338
0:40:11,64 --> 0:40:16,64
room, the parcel post parts, shipment repair
and service area, servile area receiving testing


339
0:40:16,64 --> 0:40:23,51
and general storage, first thing that you
can do is apart from the material handling


340
0:40:23,51 --> 0:40:29,54
effect, we were initially talking about box
number one in the SLP procedure, i.e., development


341
0:40:29,54 --> 0:40:34,0
of the flow of materialism in the various
types. We are not talking about box number


342
0:40:34,0 --> 0:40:39,63
two, where you are trying to develop activity
relationships for these things. What you can


343
0:40:39,63 --> 0:40:45,79
say is for each pair for instance you can
say that as far as repair and service parts


344
0:40:45,79 --> 0:40:54,54
is concerned its proximity two, for instance
the conference room is unimportant, so we


345
0:40:54,54 --> 0:41:3,54
give a U rating here so this is the significant
of the U. You have various ratings. Normally


346
0:41:3,54 --> 0:41:18,12
what we give is we give typically the ratings
A E I O U and X. A means it is absolutely


347
0:41:18,12 --> 0:41:25,77
essential to locate the departments close
to each other for instance, this is A, it


348
0:41:25,77 --> 0:41:31,27
is shows that parts shipment and general storage
is absolutely essential to have them close


349
0:41:31,27 --> 0:41:37,26
to each other so you have an A rating. E means
that is essential but not absolutely essential,


350
0:41:37,26 --> 0:41:43,93
so for instance service area and testing is
essential to have them close to each other.


351
0:41:43,93 --> 0:41:51,98
I is important so for instance here the conference
room in the foreman room is important to have


352
0:41:51,98 --> 0:42:0,9
them close to each other because you can call
them for conference, O ordinary close nesses.


353
0:42:0,9 --> 0:42:4,87
You have an overrating between the repair
and service department and the parcel post


354
0:42:4,87 --> 0:42:12,4
and U is unimportant that they be close to
each other, for instance conference room it


355
0:42:12,4 --> 0:42:19,3
is unimportant that it is close to parcel
post or parts shipment and so on. X means


356
0:42:19,3 --> 0:42:23,46
it is highly undesirable to have these two
departments close to each other. You do not


357
0:42:23,46 --> 0:42:33,34
see that here. What may happen is for instance
you might have a boundary; you might not want


358
0:42:33,34 --> 0:42:40,57
that to be close to your air condition metrology
shop. You can give X rating; it is highly


359
0:42:40,57 --> 0:42:46,39
undesirable to have these things there. What
is really important is given this ratings


360
0:42:46,39 --> 0:42:54,2
for these are giving the general preferences
that you may have for locating certain department


361
0:42:54,2 --> 0:42:59,27
close to each other or not. You accommodate
those priorities that you have in the form


362
0:42:59,27 --> 0:43:10,8
of these ratings, these are called activity
relationships. The numbers are normally given


363
0:43:10,8 --> 0:43:19,23
because a factor say E might, you might have
a number of reasons 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 which you


364
0:43:19,23 --> 0:43:20,89
document.
(Refer Slide Time: 43:18)


365
0:43:20,89 --> 0:43:37,73
‘Might’ refers to for what reason we identify
E. When you are documenting this, the numbers


366
0:43:37,73 --> 0:43:43,89
are also clear here.
We talk about these ratings:


367
0:43:43,89 --> 0:43:46,37
Absolutely essential
Especially important


368
0:43:46,37 --> 0:43:48,51
Important
Ordinary closeness OK


369
0:43:48,51 --> 0:43:51,63
unimportant
and X is undesirable.


370
0:43:51,63 --> 0:43:57,23
When you are giving any rating it could be
for various reasons for which you get a code


371
0:43:57,23 --> 0:44:2,49
like flow of materials, ease of supervision,
common personnel, and contact necessary and


372
0:44:2,49 --> 0:44:7,68
convenience or something else. When you give
a rating you might see whether it is for this


373
0:44:7,68 --> 0:44:13,17
reason or that reason whatever that is the
idea. On the basis of this information we


374
0:44:13,17 --> 0:44:26,87
can develop what is called an activity relationship
chart. This is what an activity relationship


375
0:44:26,87 --> 0:44:34,5
chart looks like. We have these departments
from 1 to 10 which you can talk about, so


376
0:44:34,5 --> 0:44:45,78
each square represents a department 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. After being represented


377
0:44:45,78 --> 0:44:53,36
by a square, you identify what kind of a rating
you want to get between these departments.


378
0:44:53,36 --> 0:44:58,28
Mind you the rating can also consider the
material handling effort which you computed


379
0:44:58,28 --> 0:45:8,91
in step one. You can have various types of
situation. It should be one line here, two


380
0:45:8,91 --> 0:45:16,0
lines here, three lines here and four lines
here that is it and X U is no relationship


381
0:45:16,0 --> 0:45:21,37
and X rating could be wave V diagram. What
will happen is for instance between one and


382
0:45:21,37 --> 0:45:27,24
three there are three lines. It means that
there is an E rating between 1 and 3.


383
0:45:27,24 --> 0:45:33,47
Similarly for the others what will happen
is that the number of lines between a department


384
0:45:33,47 --> 0:45:38,58
actually shows the a affinity between these
departments that is the related desirability


385
0:45:38,58 --> 0:45:43,35
of different departments to be close to each
other is stronger if the bond is stronger


386
0:45:43,35 --> 0:45:48,49
and the number of lines show the bond. You
are basically getting an idea of which department


387
0:45:48,49 --> 0:45:58,58
should get close to each other to this. This
is called an activity relationship diagram.


388
0:45:58,58 --> 0:46:3,34
Here we assumed that the same size was there
for department particular to calculate the


389
0:46:3,34 --> 0:46:8,75
requirements of each department. So what will
happen is typically how we will be able to


390
0:46:8,75 --> 0:46:13,3
do that for different departments? say if
this is the saw department you know that this


391
0:46:13,3 --> 0:46:20,22
houses the equipment, the Amstrong hack saw
and there are 3 of these the machine center


392
0:46:20,22 --> 0:46:28,23
dimension for each of these in feet in 10/9.
The total machine area requirement is 190


393
0:46:28,23 --> 0:46:37,63
per machine and the total process area required
is because there are 3 machines 570 square


394
0:46:37,63 --> 0:46:38,91
feet.


395
0:46:38,91 --> 0:46:44,7
You can find out immediately the amount of
machine area that you need for this department


396
0:46:44,7 --> 0:46:49,41
called saw, similarly in the mill you might
have different types of machines. You have


397
0:46:49,41 --> 0:46:54,19
a plain mill - 5 of them, vertical mill - 7
of them, hand mill- 4 of them. You know the


398
0:46:54,19 --> 0:47:1,27
department sizes of the machines center requirements,
area of which department and the total area


399
0:47:1,27 --> 0:47:8,39
corresponding to each of these machines. This
exercise can be done for the calculation of


400
0:47:8,39 --> 0:47:11,7
the production space.


401
0:47:11,7 --> 0:47:27,31
We do it for each department in the same manner
and at the end of it we have been able to


402
0:47:27,31 --> 0:47:34,17
find out the total at that mean, the final
area requirements the total square feet required


403
0:47:34,17 --> 0:47:42,47
is now 3931. This is the space required only
for the machines, so normal practice in factory


404
0:47:42,47 --> 0:47:48,4
design is to add 40 percent space for aisle
that is movement within the department. 40


405
0:47:48,4 --> 0:47:55,93
percent aisle space of this is 1572. The total
production space required is 5503 that is


406
0:47:55,93 --> 0:48:1,24
how we calculated this space and we also know
the space requirement of individual departments


407
0:48:1,24 --> 0:48:12,95
as a consequence. We have so far not considered
non productive activity space, this is only


408
0:48:12,95 --> 0:48:13,57
protection space.


409
0:48:13,57 --> 0:48:18,69
You will have to add the requirements of the
non production activity space for storage,


410
0:48:18,69 --> 0:48:23,81
office, locker rooms, foreman maintenance,
and tool crib and so on. This total area comes


411
0:48:23,81 --> 0:48:33,7
out to 1448 square feet in addition to that
you already had. We have to add to the earlier


412
0:48:33,7 --> 0:48:41,91
area production area 5503, this additional
space 1448 and get the total requirement of


413
0:48:41,91 --> 0:48:46,55
6951 square feet of floor space required in
total.


414
0:48:46,55 --> 0:48:51,4
This is the activity involved in calculating
the space from the production requirements


415
0:48:51,4 --> 0:48:58,8
and the non production requirements. What
is then finally done is we have the activity


416
0:48:58,8 --> 0:49:5,66
relationship diagram. The activity relationship
diagram of each department was shown as a


417
0:49:5,66 --> 0:49:12,4
square; this is called a space relationship
diagram. We did the calculations for the space;


418
0:49:12,4 --> 0:49:18,6
each department is shown propositional to
its size. This department has a size of so


419
0:49:18,6 --> 0:49:19,6
much.


420
0:49:19,6 --> 0:49:23,69
This department has a size of so much and
so on. This was a bigger department and it


421
0:49:23,69 --> 0:49:31,63
has a size of 1750 and so on. You represent
these departments in terms of sizes propositional


422
0:49:31,63 --> 0:49:38,21
to the areas. What is the problem now? If
you can imagine that these individual blocks


423
0:49:38,21 --> 0:49:47,49
are cut out of card board with various things,
you could shift them around and try to range


424
0:49:47,49 --> 0:49:54,89
them in the form of a layout and you could
then ultimately get a layout. This is basically


425
0:49:54,89 --> 0:50:4,77
what may of the computer programs do. They
begin with this diagram as an input and then


426
0:50:4,77 --> 0:50:9,97
by shuffling around these departments, generate
a layout. Obviously there are infinite possible


427
0:50:9,97 --> 0:50:15,46
combinations. You have to look for a best
combination and best means. What is your objective?


428
0:50:15,46 --> 0:50:21,18
The objective could be anything; generally
the objective is a material handling effort.


429
0:50:21,18 --> 0:50:27,12
If you are using activity relationships, you
are trying to maximize the material handling


430
0:50:27,12 --> 0:50:33,9
and other factors also. What you do is you
can give some weightages to A E I O U X, some


431
0:50:33,9 --> 0:50:41,11
marks and ultimately develop a layout for
those particular boxes.


432
0:50:41,11 --> 0:50:48,1
Finally what we do is we can develop a plant
layout by shuffling these departments. Ultimately


433
0:50:48,1 --> 0:50:53,41
this shuffling leads to what is called a block
plan. So this is the block plan. We show department


434
0:50:53,41 --> 0:50:55,54
1 should be here, 2, 3, 4, 5


435
0:50:55,54 --> 0:51:0,12
We actually solved the plant layout problem
for this particular case by developing a block


436
0:51:0,12 --> 0:51:8,23
plant which looks like this. Finally when
we look at what we have tried to do in this


437
0:51:8,23 --> 0:51:13,65
particular lecture, we have seen that the
objectives in different types of layouts whether


438
0:51:13,65 --> 0:51:18,76
you talking about process layout, product
layout or mixed layout or even cellular layouts,


439
0:51:18,76 --> 0:51:25,68
the objectives are different. Therefore the
ways of handling these layouts are all different.


440
0:51:25,68 --> 0:51:32,54
Systematic layout planning is a systematic
procedure for designing process layouts and


441
0:51:32,54 --> 0:51:40,21
basically we looked at this procedure in this
particular class to identify how systematic


442
0:51:40,21 --> 0:51:43,69
layout planning can be done for process layouts.


443
0:51:43,69 --> 0:51:50,81
From-to charts measure material handling effort.
A step by step procedure for a sample layout


444
0:51:50,81 --> 0:51:56,63
was done and the major advantage of this particular
systematic layout planning procedure is that


445
0:51:56,63 --> 0:52:5,13
it is a precursor to computerized layout planning.
Therefore in the next class we will try to


446
0:52:5,13 --> 0:52:11,5
look at some of the computerized layout planning
procedures that are available for handling


447
0:52:11,5 --> 0:52:28,12
the layout planning problem course. This will
constitute a basis for doing the exercise.


448
0:52:28,12 --> 0:54:28,12
Thank you
