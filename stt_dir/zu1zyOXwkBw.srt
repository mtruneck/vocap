0:0:1,0 --> 0:1:22,887



2
0:1:22,887 --> 0:1:37,444
- Jah Rastafari!


3
0:1:37,444 --> 0:1:39,279



4
0:1:39,279 --> 0:1:41,31
Exodus


5
0:1:41,31 --> 0:1:44,492



6
0:1:44,492 --> 0:1:53,126
Movement of Jah people yeah


7
0:1:53,126 --> 0:1:56,713
Jah come to break the oppression

Wipe away transgression

Set your captives free


11
0:2:7,223 --> 0:2:11,61
Jah


12
0:2:11,61 --> 0:2:14,814
Rastafari


13
0:2:14,814 --> 0:2:17,901
Jah


14
0:2:17,901 --> 0:2:24,616
Rastafari


15
0:2:24,616 --> 0:2:38,213



16
0:2:38,213 --> 0:2:41,299
 He used to love singing.


17
0:2:41,299 --> 0:2:43,927
I used to teach him little jingles,


18
0:2:43,927 --> 0:2:46,137
and he used to love them.


19
0:2:46,137 --> 0:2:48,807
And the chief one that he used
to know was...


20
0:2:48,807 --> 0:2:53,561
I had a little donkey that's grey


21
0:2:53,561 --> 0:2:57,607
I feed him in a barn every day


22
0:2:57,607 --> 0:3:3,655
And when he hears me whistle
he knows I have a thistle


23
0:3:3,655 --> 0:3:8,243
He'd rather eat a thistle than hay


24
0:3:8,243 --> 0:3:11,621
Hee-haw hee-haw


25
0:3:11,621 --> 0:3:15,41
Hee-haw hee-haw


26
0:3:15,41 --> 0:3:18,86
And that is all my donkey can say


27
0:3:18,86 --> 0:3:22,549
And then you would see him,
you know, keeping time.


28
0:3:22,549 --> 0:3:28,513
And you would see
that he was enjoying it.


29
0:3:28,513 --> 0:3:29,889
 How did it all start?


30
0:3:29,889 --> 0:3:39,399
Had music always been a part of your life
from when you were a little boy?


31
0:3:39,399 --> 0:3:44,696
What part of Jamaica?


32
0:3:44,696 --> 0:3:55,457
- Yeah?


33
0:3:55,457 --> 0:4:35,246
 Well, you see,
Bob Marley is my cousin, you know?


34
0:4:35,246 --> 0:4:38,5
- Bob liked to ride the donkey
and, you know,


35
0:4:38,5 --> 0:4:43,4
go to the field with his grandfather
and things like that.


36
0:4:43,4 --> 0:4:46,883
Because he's a country boy, you know.


37
0:4:46,883 --> 0:4:49,427
 Nine Mile was a place that...


38
0:4:49,427 --> 0:4:53,89
there wasn't a lot of civilized activity.


39
0:4:53,89 --> 0:4:57,602
Electricity was not available
in those areas,


40
0:4:57,602 --> 0:5:2,19
so you see a lot of "peeny wallies"...
you know, those little fireflies.


41
0:5:2,19 --> 0:5:5,193
And that's the only light at night...


42
0:5:5,193 --> 0:5:7,153
other than the moon
and the stars, you know.


43
0:5:7,153 --> 0:5:10,156
So, as a youth
coming out of Kingston...


44
0:5:10,156 --> 0:5:13,91
that was accustomed
to jukebox and sound system,


45
0:5:13,91 --> 0:5:20,834
it was really something
to get accustomed to.


46
0:5:20,834 --> 0:5:23,2
 And do you remember
when you first met Robert?


47
0:5:23,2 --> 0:5:27,215
- Yes. First time I saw him,
I saw this little youth...


48
0:5:27,215 --> 0:5:28,842
cutting up this big chunk of wood


49
0:5:28,842 --> 0:5:31,845
and putting it on his head bit by bit
and taking it away...


50
0:5:31,845 --> 0:5:34,18
I say, that's...
You know, and then...


51
0:5:34,18 --> 0:5:37,225
He was the only little,
what you call it,


52
0:5:37,225 --> 0:5:39,978
red "pickney" in the place,


53
0:5:39,978 --> 0:5:44,566
because everybody else
was black people.


54
0:5:44,566 --> 0:5:46,651
 Who was Bob's dad?


55
0:5:46,651 --> 0:5:59,664



56
0:5:59,664 --> 0:6:2,5
 He liked
when you call him "Captain."


57
0:6:2,5 --> 0:6:5,795
Yes, but his...
his name is Norval.


58
0:6:5,795 --> 0:6:9,465
I met him right there in Nine Mile,


59
0:6:9,465 --> 0:6:11,593
and then as a white man in the district,


60
0:6:11,593 --> 0:6:14,762
you know, always ride
his horse and things like that.


61
0:6:14,762 --> 0:6:17,307
He and my father
becomes good friends.


62
0:6:17,307 --> 0:6:23,187
Then at that time he see this little girl
and I guess he liked her, and, um,


63
0:6:23,187 --> 0:6:26,983
we finally get together
and that's how it...


64
0:6:26,983 --> 0:6:29,402
that's how it happened.


65
0:6:29,402 --> 0:6:32,53
 How old was your sister
when she met the Captain?


66
0:6:32,53 --> 0:6:35,366
- She was, what, 16.


67
0:6:35,366 --> 0:6:40,58
Captain was...
He was about in his 60s.


68
0:6:40,58 --> 0:6:59,98
- So he was an old man?
- Yes.


69
0:6:59,98 --> 0:7:4,103
- My name is Peter Marley.
Bob Marley is my second cousin.


70
0:7:4,103 --> 0:7:7,398
 What did you know about
Bob Marley's father?


71
0:7:7,398 --> 0:7:10,652
 He rode a horse most of the time.


72
0:7:10,652 --> 0:7:12,153
He was in the British army.


73
0:7:12,153 --> 0:7:14,989
I think he was stationed somewhere
in India in World War II...


74
0:7:14,989 --> 0:7:20,411
when he got shell shock.


75
0:7:20,411 --> 0:7:23,831
I understand he drank
and that he lived a...


76
0:7:23,831 --> 0:7:26,918
What should I say?


77
0:7:26,918 --> 0:7:56,447
A full life.


78
0:7:56,447 --> 0:7:59,45
 Did he get teased
for being mixed?


79
0:7:59,45 --> 0:8:2,954
Yeah, sure.
Worse than teased.


80
0:8:2,954 --> 0:8:7,0
Teased is not the word
You call it rejected.


81
0:8:7,0 --> 0:8:10,336
He did everything that
his bigger uncles should be doing...


82
0:8:10,336 --> 0:8:13,715
because it was
their duty to move horses...


83
0:8:13,715 --> 0:8:16,384
and to make sure
that the pigs were fed,


84
0:8:16,384 --> 0:8:20,513
and they left
all of that work for Robert.


85
0:8:20,513 --> 0:8:24,851
He had to earn his every meal.


86
0:8:24,851 --> 0:8:48,166



87
0:8:48,166 --> 0:8:50,334
We went to the same school.


88
0:8:50,334 --> 0:8:52,295
And he had me teaching me the stuff...


89
0:8:52,295 --> 0:8:55,214
of what takes place in the country...
how to ride a donkey, how to ride a horse.


90
0:8:55,214 --> 0:8:58,51
How to do all of this kind of stuff.


91
0:8:58,51 --> 0:9:0,428
And I taught him about music,
'cause...


92
0:9:0,428 --> 0:9:4,599
that was what I was exposed
to prior coming to Saint Ann.


93
0:9:4,599 --> 0:9:10,813



94
0:9:10,813 --> 0:9:13,941
 I was accustomed to
building bamboo guitars...


95
0:9:13,941 --> 0:9:15,485
and sardine tin guitars.


96
0:9:15,485 --> 0:9:18,154
Cutting the wire...
the electric wire...


97
0:9:18,154 --> 0:9:25,87
opening it up, taking out those little
fine wires and making our strings.


98
0:9:25,87 --> 0:10:8,788



99
0:10:8,788 --> 0:10:12,166
In a little district on a little island


100
0:10:12,166 --> 0:10:15,128
Where men and pretty gal run wild


101
0:10:15,128 --> 0:10:17,964
Well there's one old crazy
who went much wider


102
0:10:17,964 --> 0:10:20,633
So they call her rider
Rough rider


103
0:10:20,633 --> 0:10:25,555
- Outta that, Robert Marley saw...


104
0:10:25,555 --> 0:10:28,349
a way out.


105
0:10:28,349 --> 0:10:31,269
His guitar.


106
0:10:31,269 --> 0:10:36,65
In high seas or in low seas


107
0:10:36,65 --> 0:10:42,29
I'm gonna be your friend


108
0:10:42,29 --> 0:10:52,707
I'm gonna be your friend


109
0:10:52,707 --> 0:10:59,213
I heard her praying praying praying


110
0:10:59,213 --> 0:11:2,884
I said I heard my mother


111
0:11:2,884 --> 0:11:9,64
She was praying in the night


112
0:11:9,64 --> 0:11:14,729
And the words that she said
The words that she said


113
0:11:14,729 --> 0:11:19,66
They still lingers in my head
Lingers in my head


114
0:11:19,66 --> 0:11:23,738
She said a child is born in this world


115
0:11:23,738 --> 0:11:27,33
He needs protection


116
0:11:27,33 --> 0:11:30,828
Whoa mmm


117
0:11:30,828 --> 0:11:34,165
God guide and protect us


118
0:11:34,165 --> 0:11:41,839



119
0:11:41,839 --> 0:11:44,508
One good thing about music


120
0:11:44,508 --> 0:11:47,94
When it hits
You feel no pain


121
0:11:47,94 --> 0:11:51,14
I say one good thing about music


122
0:11:51,14 --> 0:11:54,227
When it hits
You feel no pain


123
0:11:54,227 --> 0:11:56,938
Hit me with music


124
0:11:56,938 --> 0:12:0,191
Hit me with music now


125
0:12:0,191 --> 0:12:2,318
This is
Trenchtown rock


126
0:12:2,318 --> 0:12:4,278
Don't what's that


127
0:12:4,278 --> 0:12:7,782
 We grew up in Trench Town.
We were exposed to everything.


128
0:12:7,782 --> 0:12:9,492
'Cause you have the bad guys there


129
0:12:9,492 --> 0:12:11,702
who eventually turn out
to be the con men.


130
0:12:11,702 --> 0:12:16,29
You have the musicians.
And you have the sportsmen.


131
0:12:16,29 --> 0:12:20,753
Everybody lived just like a block away
from each other.


132
0:12:20,753 --> 0:12:23,13
It's like a melting pot.


133
0:12:23,13 --> 0:12:26,634
- Well, living in Trench Town,
you know, um,


134
0:12:26,634 --> 0:12:29,887
as a young man, surviving was easy.


135
0:12:29,887 --> 0:12:33,99
The only thing that you have to really
look out for was the police, you know,


136
0:12:33,99 --> 0:12:36,6
'cause the police can just get ya,
frame ya.


137
0:12:36,6 --> 0:12:37,687
You go to prison and...


138
0:12:37,687 --> 0:12:40,898
"Look, I come from Trench Town."
Trench Town's that...


139
0:12:40,898 --> 0:12:42,608
Find them say, "Where you from?"


140
0:12:42,608 --> 0:12:45,27
You say, "Trench Town."
You're gone.


141
0:12:45,27 --> 0:12:46,487
You know what I mean?


142
0:12:46,487 --> 0:12:49,282
- No, it was tough.
All of Kingston is like that, you know?


143
0:12:49,282 --> 0:12:52,785
Everybody.
A lot of people don't know, but Bob, me,


144
0:12:52,785 --> 0:12:55,454
all of we, went to bed hungry a lot.


145
0:12:55,454 --> 0:12:56,831
I mean real hungry.


146
0:12:56,831 --> 0:12:58,833
I don't mean like, "Oh, he had some,
a little piece of this."


147
0:12:58,833 --> 0:13:1,502
Nothing.
One of the famous lines was,


148
0:13:1,502 --> 0:13:4,797
"Drink some water and go to bed."
You know?


149
0:13:4,797 --> 0:13:7,3
In those days you never have...
You might have one pair of shoes.


150
0:13:7,3 --> 0:13:10,469
One suit of clothes.
So you walk bare feet all the time.


151
0:13:10,469 --> 0:13:13,681
Bob too, you know?
A lot of people don't know that.


152
0:13:13,681 --> 0:13:16,767
That kind of sufferation and struggle...


153
0:13:16,767 --> 0:13:20,521
can make you either go bad or good.


154
0:13:20,521 --> 0:13:22,231
And I guess
that's what he did, you know?


155
0:13:22,231 --> 0:13:24,483
He figured the music would get him out,


156
0:13:24,483 --> 0:13:31,949
so he stuck to it and focused,
you know?


157
0:13:31,949 --> 0:13:35,995
 You know, as an individual
they're forced to be creative.


158
0:13:35,995 --> 0:13:38,956
Because that's where
your reggae music born, Trench Town.


159
0:13:38,956 --> 0:13:51,177



160
0:13:51,177 --> 0:13:54,805
Dread natty dread now


161
0:13:54,805 --> 0:13:56,515
Natty dread


162
0:13:56,515 --> 0:14:0,186
Dreadlock Congo bongo I


163
0:14:0,186 --> 0:14:1,729
Natty dread


164
0:14:1,729 --> 0:14:4,23
Natty dreadlock


165
0:14:4,23 --> 0:14:5,775
 In Trench Town
we have First Street.


166
0:14:5,775 --> 0:14:7,401
All the way up to 13th Street.


167
0:14:7,401 --> 0:14:8,861
First, Second, Third,
Fourth, Fifth, Sixth,


168
0:14:8,861 --> 0:14:10,613
and so on and so forth.


169
0:14:10,613 --> 0:14:12,865
Him sing about it in "Natty Dread."


170
0:14:12,865 --> 0:14:16,577
Then I walk up the First Street


171
0:14:16,577 --> 0:14:18,204
Natty dread


172
0:14:18,204 --> 0:14:22,333
And then I walk up
the Second Street to see


173
0:14:22,333 --> 0:14:24,126
Natty dread


174
0:14:24,126 --> 0:14:36,639



175
0:14:36,639 --> 0:14:39,934
- He was different, mon.
He was different.


176
0:14:39,934 --> 0:14:43,979
He just loved music.


177
0:14:43,979 --> 0:14:46,857
Music and cricket and football.


178
0:14:46,857 --> 0:14:49,68
Natty Congo I


179
0:14:49,68 --> 0:14:50,569
Natty dread


180
0:14:50,569 --> 0:14:54,532
Oh


181
0:14:54,532 --> 0:14:56,742
- One day he just come home
and give me the books and say,


182
0:14:56,742 --> 0:14:58,494
"I'm not going back to school."


183
0:14:58,494 --> 0:15:3,249
And, um, him say have a friend
that he can give these books to.


184
0:15:3,249 --> 0:15:6,43
And he did that,
and then he turned to his music.


185
0:15:6,43 --> 0:15:10,464
I'm a rebel


186
0:15:10,464 --> 0:15:15,1
Soul rebel


187
0:15:15,1 --> 0:15:17,763
I'm a capturer


188
0:15:17,763 --> 0:15:18,973
That's right


189
0:15:18,973 --> 0:15:21,809
Soul adventurer


190
0:15:21,809 --> 0:15:24,19
Yeah mon


191
0:15:24,19 --> 0:15:28,566
I'm a rebel


192
0:15:28,566 --> 0:15:30,693
Soul rebel


193
0:15:30,693 --> 0:15:34,697
 Robert keep pounding,
keep pounding, keep pounding.


194
0:15:34,697 --> 0:15:38,75
Telling me that
this is what it should be and, uh...


195
0:15:38,75 --> 0:15:40,77
And I'm saying, "No,
I'm gonna get ready to go to college.


196
0:15:40,77 --> 0:15:42,705
I can't be no music."
He say, "No, it's music."


197
0:15:42,705 --> 0:15:45,416
 When did you begin
to get involved in music?


198
0:15:45,416 --> 0:15:47,1
- Well, I was always interested
in music,


199
0:15:47,1 --> 0:15:49,545
but at that time I was learning
a trade, you know,


200
0:15:49,545 --> 0:15:52,59
and meet up
some guys who can sing.


201
0:15:52,59 --> 0:15:55,926
One named Desmond Dekker.


202
0:15:55,926 --> 0:16:1,182
- Desmond Dekker and Bob
used to work as welders...


203
0:16:1,182 --> 0:16:2,808
at the same place.


204
0:16:2,808 --> 0:16:6,729
Desmond Dekker came down,
and I auditioned him.


205
0:16:6,729 --> 0:16:9,44
And we recorded his song.


206
0:16:9,44 --> 0:16:14,528
 And after he did that song,
Robert wanted now to record.


207
0:16:14,528 --> 0:16:16,53
So Desmond take him Beverley's.


208
0:16:16,53 --> 0:16:18,616
And he went away
and recorded a song...


209
0:16:18,616 --> 0:16:24,163
to prove to me that if he
could record a song, I could.


210
0:16:24,163 --> 0:16:28,918
 Don't you look at me
so smug now


211
0:16:28,918 --> 0:16:32,546
And say I'm going bad


212
0:16:32,546 --> 0:16:36,842
Who are you to judge me


213
0:16:36,842 --> 0:16:40,221
And the life that I live


214
0:16:40,221 --> 0:16:43,933
- I noticed his use of words
in the songs.


215
0:16:43,933 --> 0:16:47,436
"Judge Not"...
it was a revolutionary song...


216
0:16:47,436 --> 0:16:51,565
defending his rights as an individual.


217
0:16:51,565 --> 0:16:55,986
It occurred to me,
"Wow, this guy's really a good poet."


218
0:16:55,986 --> 0:16:58,739
Judge not


219
0:16:58,739 --> 0:17:1,283
Before you judge yourself


220
0:17:1,283 --> 0:17:2,743
- After the recording,


221
0:17:2,743 --> 0:17:4,995
Leslie Kong wanted
to change Bob's name,


222
0:17:4,995 --> 0:17:8,999
because Robert Marley
didn't sound so catchy and easy.


223
0:17:8,999 --> 0:17:12,628
So he wanted to call Bob "Adam."


224
0:17:12,628 --> 0:17:15,47
Adam Marley.


225
0:17:15,47 --> 0:17:21,22
Bob wouldn't have it.


226
0:17:21,22 --> 0:17:25,182
 He realizes that a group
would be maybe the appropriate thing,


227
0:17:25,182 --> 0:17:28,602
other than being individual,
solo artists.


228
0:17:28,602 --> 0:17:32,106
We used to listen to groups
like Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers,


229
0:17:32,106 --> 0:17:34,858
The Drifters, The Platters.


230
0:17:34,858 --> 0:17:38,654
So there was a recruitment
process taking place.


231
0:17:38,654 --> 0:17:43,325
Myself and Robert started
to put the group together.


232
0:17:43,325 --> 0:17:46,829
And then here comes this tall, dark,


233
0:17:46,829 --> 0:17:49,498
as they would say,
handsome dude named Peter,


234
0:17:49,498 --> 0:17:51,917
and he has
this guitar knowledge.


235
0:17:51,917 --> 0:17:55,296
And from Robert, you hear Robert say,
"Play guitar? You serious?"


236
0:17:55,296 --> 0:17:57,172
So he goes give him
the guitar right away.


237
0:17:57,172 --> 0:18:1,802
So it's four-string steel,
but Peter tune the four-string,


238
0:18:1,802 --> 0:18:5,806
and he's just like that.


239
0:18:5,806 --> 0:18:7,433
 On First Street
is a music street.


240
0:18:7,433 --> 0:18:11,478
We had three or four places
on First Street that we rehearse,


241
0:18:11,478 --> 0:18:13,981
and they were rehearsing
like every day.


242
0:18:13,981 --> 0:18:17,192
At the time,
it was Bob, Peter, Bunny.


243
0:18:17,192 --> 0:18:21,572
 We used to call ourselves
"Juveniles." "Brothers in the Ghetto."


244
0:18:21,572 --> 0:18:23,907
Where we used to go to rehearse,
they'd say,


245
0:18:23,907 --> 0:18:27,286
"You come from a wailing environment
where people always bawling.


246
0:18:27,286 --> 0:18:29,58
And, well,
you should be named the Wailers."


247
0:18:29,58 --> 0:18:33,709
This train it is bound to glory


248
0:18:33,709 --> 0:18:39,423
This train


249
0:18:39,423 --> 0:18:43,594
This train is bound to glory


250
0:18:43,594 --> 0:18:49,391
This train


251
0:18:49,391 --> 0:18:54,521
This train is bound to glory


252
0:18:54,521 --> 0:18:56,649
This train don't carry


253
0:18:56,649 --> 0:19:2,196
- As far as the Wailers' harmony,
and the building of the Wailers musically,


254
0:19:2,196 --> 0:19:6,283
Joe Higgs is the responsible person.


255
0:19:6,283 --> 0:19:8,702
Having his own career,


256
0:19:8,702 --> 0:19:42,152
he decided to take the group up
as a project.


257
0:19:42,152 --> 0:19:46,448
His policy was that great stars
sometimes get messed up...


258
0:19:46,448 --> 0:19:50,35
when they get afraid, you know,
when they get nervous on stage.


259
0:19:50,35 --> 0:19:51,954
So he said that...


260
0:19:51,954 --> 0:19:56,83
if we went to the cemetery
at, say, 2:00 in the morning...


261
0:19:56,83 --> 0:19:58,46
and sang for those people,


262
0:19:58,46 --> 0:20:1,839
then we can't be afraid
when we hit the stage.


263
0:20:1,839 --> 0:20:5,968
And we went with Joe,
sat on the graves, played.


264
0:20:5,968 --> 0:20:10,347
Several times we do it until he thought
we were brave enough now.


265
0:20:10,347 --> 0:20:16,895



266
0:20:16,895 --> 0:20:20,607
Gather together
Be brothers and sisters


267
0:20:20,607 --> 0:20:23,819
We're independent
We're independent


268
0:20:23,819 --> 0:20:26,613
 Just about the time
of the independence,


269
0:20:26,613 --> 0:20:29,45
the Jamaican musicians
wanted to have a music...


270
0:20:29,45 --> 0:20:31,744
that they can call Jamaican music.


271
0:20:31,744 --> 0:20:34,163
- Well, Jamaica came up
with a unique rhythm.


272
0:20:34,163 --> 0:20:36,123
I didn't think it was deliberately done.


273
0:20:36,123 --> 0:20:40,335
I think it was an attempt to play
something, and it came out that way.


274
0:20:40,335 --> 0:20:43,338
It became known as reggae,
but it started off as ska,


275
0:20:43,338 --> 0:20:45,966
which was putting all the accent...


276
0:20:45,966 --> 0:20:49,52
on a different beat than what is normally
where the accent is.


277
0:20:49,52 --> 0:20:51,972
It would be on the off beat
instead of the on beat.


278
0:20:51,972 --> 0:20:55,476



279
0:20:55,476 --> 0:20:59,646
 Ska developed out of American
music that we were exposed to...


280
0:20:59,646 --> 0:21:2,733
on top of our Jamaican
indigenous music,


281
0:21:2,733 --> 0:21:7,571
such as mento, calypso, Kumina.


282
0:21:7,571 --> 0:21:9,573
Simmer down


283
0:21:9,573 --> 0:21:11,533
You lickin' too hot


284
0:21:11,533 --> 0:21:14,953
So simmer down
Soon you'll get dropped


285
0:21:14,953 --> 0:21:18,707
- We were at a bar one evening.


286
0:21:18,707 --> 0:21:21,46
And one of the guys, them says to us,
"Listen to this group."


287
0:21:21,46 --> 0:21:24,254
And they punched the jukebox.


288
0:21:24,254 --> 0:21:28,175
And the song was called "Simmer Down."


289
0:21:28,175 --> 0:21:31,178
And no more other tune
play on that box...


290
0:21:31,178 --> 0:21:34,681
the whole time we were there
but "Simmer Down," I tell you.


291
0:21:34,681 --> 0:21:38,769
Oh simmer down
Oh control your temper


292
0:21:38,769 --> 0:21:42,105
Simmer down
For the battle will be hotter


293
0:21:42,105 --> 0:21:45,484
- "Simmer Down" went straight
into the number-one position,


294
0:21:45,484 --> 0:21:48,612
and the Wailers were launched.


295
0:21:48,612 --> 0:21:54,409
...that I'm leaving you today
Simmer down


296
0:21:54,409 --> 0:21:57,538
- What was it like working at Studio 1,
where you started, in those days?


297
0:21:57,538 --> 0:22:0,666
 Yeah, it was good,
you know, 'cause, you know,


298
0:22:0,666 --> 0:22:2,84
first experience within music.


299
0:22:2,84 --> 0:22:3,627
Working with some good musician


300
0:22:3,627 --> 0:22:6,922
and trying to get the harmonies
and everything. It was great.


301
0:22:6,922 --> 0:22:9,883
 I heard you actually...
you personally lived in the studio.


302
0:22:9,883 --> 0:22:11,26
 Sometime.


303
0:22:11,26 --> 0:22:13,72
 You had Coxsone made you
a room out the back.


304
0:22:13,72 --> 0:22:15,97
 Yes.


305
0:22:15,97 --> 0:22:19,59
 Well, Coxsone was,
um, a smart guy,


306
0:22:19,59 --> 0:22:21,562
in that he has an ear
for music, good music.


307
0:22:21,562 --> 0:22:23,522
- He might not have been
an instrument player.


308
0:22:23,522 --> 0:22:25,941
He might not even know
if the guitar is tuned,


309
0:22:25,941 --> 0:22:29,278
but he knows when the sound is right.


310
0:22:29,278 --> 0:22:31,655
- He has his own program on the radio.


311
0:22:31,655 --> 0:22:33,282
Has his own record shop.


312
0:22:33,282 --> 0:22:36,159
Has his own sound system.
Has his own studio.


313
0:22:36,159 --> 0:22:37,703
So he's obviously a leader.


314
0:22:37,703 --> 0:22:41,29
- Coxsone was like a father to us,
you know, to be honest with you.


315
0:22:41,29 --> 0:22:42,749
Coxsone was like a father to us.


316
0:22:42,749 --> 0:22:48,755
He cared for us.


317
0:22:48,755 --> 0:22:53,135
Coxsone gave Robbie a little room
round the back of the premises.


318
0:22:53,135 --> 0:22:55,178
I didn't have anywhere
to live neither.


319
0:22:55,178 --> 0:22:58,56
So Robbie and me lived there.
Both of us lived there.


320
0:22:58,56 --> 0:23:0,934
So we became intimate good friends.


321
0:23:0,934 --> 0:23:6,732
He gave Robbie a record player
and a lot of foreign records.


322
0:23:6,732 --> 0:23:9,693
Robbie was a fanatic
in listening to these people...


323
0:23:9,693 --> 0:23:12,112
because he was a serious,
focused man.


324
0:23:12,112 --> 0:23:14,156
Even as a youth.


325
0:23:14,156 --> 0:23:20,245
- Jamaican music developed from
what we call "do overs,"


326
0:23:20,245 --> 0:23:23,874
a version of somebody's song
in America.


327
0:23:23,874 --> 0:23:30,88
Each night
I ask the stars up above


328
0:23:30,88 --> 0:23:36,178
Why must I be a teenager in love


329
0:23:36,178 --> 0:23:39,222
Put me in your milling machine


330
0:23:39,222 --> 0:23:44,19
I never thought you could act so mean


331
0:23:44,19 --> 0:23:48,65
Now I'm wondering what to do


332
0:23:48,65 --> 0:23:52,69
To see if you could love me too


333
0:23:52,69 --> 0:23:55,28
 Bob had a good sound
'cause he's singing lead.


334
0:23:55,28 --> 0:23:56,907
And the harmony was tight.


335
0:23:56,907 --> 0:24:1,954
- The harmony Bunny carried,
and Peter was fantastic.


336
0:24:1,954 --> 0:24:9,711
Why must I be a teenager in love


337
0:24:9,711 --> 0:24:14,7
 Peter and Bunny was
the most vocal one to say hi,


338
0:24:14,7 --> 0:24:18,303
but Bob was very reserved
and just look.


339
0:24:18,303 --> 0:24:22,99
As he would say, just "cotch and look."


340
0:24:22,99 --> 0:24:26,19
- As much as there was this obvious
love and admiration...


341
0:24:26,19 --> 0:24:28,146
for each other and of each other,


342
0:24:28,146 --> 0:24:31,108
there was always
a deep underlying tension...


343
0:24:31,108 --> 0:24:35,696
that none would be
a "yes man" to the other.


344
0:24:35,696 --> 0:24:40,33
I think the music was the glue
that held them together.


345
0:24:40,33 --> 0:24:43,745
Feel them spirit


346
0:24:43,745 --> 0:24:47,416
Feel them spirit


347
0:24:47,416 --> 0:24:51,878
Feel them spirit


348
0:24:51,878 --> 0:24:55,7
Lord, I thank you


349
0:24:55,7 --> 0:24:59,94
Lord, I thank you


350
0:24:59,94 --> 0:25:2,931
I'm gonna put it on


351
0:25:2,931 --> 0:25:13,66
I'm gonna put it on


352
0:25:13,66 --> 0:25:19,364
- By then he was admiring me.


353
0:25:19,364 --> 0:25:21,783
I got a letter from Bunny,
bringing a letter.


354
0:25:21,783 --> 0:25:25,537
It was him sending his letter
through his friend. Not by himself.


355
0:25:25,537 --> 0:25:29,332
And to say yes, he likes me
and want to talk to me.


356
0:25:29,332 --> 0:25:31,543
I say, "Come over and talk."


357
0:25:31,543 --> 0:25:34,504
And he would stay
on the other side of the road and...


358
0:25:34,504 --> 0:25:38,717
He was very shy. He was very shy.
He was a shy guy.


359
0:25:38,717 --> 0:25:44,14
I'll play your favorite song darling


360
0:25:44,14 --> 0:25:46,516
He had a seriousness,
and he was one


361
0:25:46,516 --> 0:25:57,11
that you could say
was reaching out for love.


362
0:25:57,11 --> 0:26:0,155
- I didn't think,
I liked brown-skin men.


363
0:26:0,155 --> 0:26:5,77
I always dream of a guy...
tall, black, handsome.


364
0:26:5,77 --> 0:26:10,415
Every young girl's dream in Jamaica
is to have a tall, black boyfriend.


365
0:26:10,415 --> 0:26:12,501
They would call Bob an outcast...


366
0:26:12,501 --> 0:26:15,212
because he really don't belong to no...
you're in-between.


367
0:26:15,212 --> 0:26:19,8
You're black and white, so they're...
"You're not even black."


368
0:26:19,8 --> 0:26:22,385
 I think he always felt
like an outsider...


369
0:26:22,385 --> 0:26:24,679
because he was a half breed.


370
0:26:24,679 --> 0:26:27,599
And when Mortimer Planno took him in,


371
0:26:27,599 --> 0:26:32,354
well, that automatically
gave him acceptance.


372
0:26:32,354 --> 0:26:37,859
 Mortimer Planno was
a Rasta spiritual leader who taught Bob.


373
0:26:37,859 --> 0:26:41,738
- He was like a preacher.
He preached Rastafarianism,


374
0:26:41,738 --> 0:26:43,448
and he had a following.


375
0:26:43,448 --> 0:26:48,411



376
0:26:48,411 --> 0:26:51,832
 He hooked up
with Bob as a young boy.


377
0:26:51,832 --> 0:26:54,292
I think that they gelled together.


378
0:26:54,292 --> 0:26:58,255
 Bob looked up to him?
- Oh, yes.


379
0:26:58,255 --> 0:27:25,407



380
0:27:25,407 --> 0:27:31,204
 Rastafarian were
the only true Afrocentric black people.


381
0:27:31,204 --> 0:27:35,876
Who preached self-reliance,
who preached self-confidence.


382
0:27:35,876 --> 0:27:38,753
 But we interpret
the Bible a different way.


383
0:27:38,753 --> 0:27:42,465
Most of these places that they're telling
you about in the Bible is in Africa.


384
0:27:42,465 --> 0:27:45,218
The Garden of Eden is in Africa.


385
0:27:45,218 --> 0:27:48,43
The teaching that we get
from the elders then...


386
0:27:48,43 --> 0:27:52,17
is that we always have to look upon
a black man as God.


387
0:27:52,17 --> 0:27:56,938
For we, somebody
that we can identify with.


388
0:27:56,938 --> 0:28:16,124



389
0:28:16,124 --> 0:28:21,63
 Emperor Haile Selassie I
is the reincarnation of Jesus Christ.


390
0:28:21,63 --> 0:28:25,133
He's our God. Rasta God.


391
0:28:25,133 --> 0:28:29,221
Rasta said the purpose of life
is to be happy.


392
0:28:29,221 --> 0:28:32,15
Everybody's supposed to be happy...


393
0:28:32,15 --> 0:28:34,809
and live in peace, love and unity.


394
0:28:34,809 --> 0:28:38,23
Yeah, mon.


395
0:28:38,23 --> 0:28:41,775
I think when him start take it serious
now as a Rastaman...


396
0:28:41,775 --> 0:28:44,527
was when him start growing dreadlocks.


397
0:28:44,527 --> 0:28:49,32
- Locks meant that you were a Rastafarian
and you've taken a vow...


398
0:28:49,32 --> 0:28:52,577
Nazarite vow not to cut or comb
your hair for a certain length of time,


399
0:28:52,577 --> 0:28:56,39
and it has a significance
and is not to be taken lightly.


400
0:28:56,39 --> 0:28:58,291
- How important are the dreadlocks?


401
0:28:58,291 --> 0:29:2,3
- This? This is my identity, mon.
- Is that part of being a Rasta?


402
0:29:2,3 --> 0:29:3,588
- Yeah, this is my identity.


403
0:29:3,588 --> 0:29:8,51
- Then you go through
all the various rules...


404
0:29:8,51 --> 0:29:10,22
for living as set out by the Bible.


405
0:29:10,22 --> 0:29:14,99
How you eat, how you live,
how you treat other people.


406
0:29:14,99 --> 0:29:15,642
And he believed that, um,


407
0:29:15,642 --> 0:29:18,186
if you practice these things,
well, life will be better.


408
0:29:18,186 --> 0:29:21,231
Not only for you,
but for everyone else.


409
0:29:21,231 --> 0:29:25,944
Got to have kaya now


410
0:29:25,944 --> 0:29:30,448
Got to have kaya now


411
0:29:30,448 --> 0:29:34,661
Got to have kaya now


412
0:29:34,661 --> 0:29:37,706
For the rain is falling


413
0:29:37,706 --> 0:29:40,166
 Marijuana's illegal in Jamaica,


414
0:29:40,166 --> 0:29:44,462
but the Rastas say they smoke it
because the Bible tells them to.


415
0:29:44,462 --> 0:29:49,9
The Book of Revelations
says to "partake of the herb."


416
0:29:49,9 --> 0:29:52,53
- The herb was like
a sacramental food to us.


417
0:29:52,53 --> 0:29:56,599
We take it for reasons,
not just to get high.


418
0:29:56,599 --> 0:29:59,269
It put us in a holy, peaceful,


419
0:29:59,269 --> 0:30:2,564
happy, inspirational mood.


420
0:30:2,564 --> 0:30:5,358
 Were you born as a Rasta?


421
0:30:5,358 --> 0:30:8,153
When I was born, you know,
and growing,


422
0:30:8,153 --> 0:30:12,449
there was a certain amount
of consciousness...


423
0:30:12,449 --> 0:30:14,409
in the higher self...


424
0:30:14,409 --> 0:30:17,203
that, you know,


425
0:30:17,203 --> 0:30:18,872
it was always a lonely world,


426
0:30:18,872 --> 0:30:24,85
not finding people who might
think like me, you know?


427
0:30:24,85 --> 0:30:25,962
So off I'm going on, and going on


428
0:30:25,962 --> 0:30:29,215
and I come to Kingston,
meet some more people.


429
0:30:29,215 --> 0:30:30,925
Them people is Rasta.


430
0:30:30,925 --> 0:30:35,13
It's after that I find out
it's the same thing I have inside.


431
0:30:35,13 --> 0:30:36,431
It's the same thing.


432
0:30:36,431 --> 0:30:38,308
- How old were you
when this started to happen?


433
0:30:38,308 --> 0:30:41,728
- This is about 17, 18, you know?
- Ah.


434
0:30:41,728 --> 0:30:46,107
- I think in the belief or knowledge...


435
0:30:46,107 --> 0:30:53,31
of Haile Selassie,
Bob found his real father,


436
0:30:53,31 --> 0:30:55,408
which he'd never really knew.


437
0:30:55,408 --> 0:30:57,619
- I think he saw himself now.


438
0:30:57,619 --> 0:30:59,704
This is where he found himself, yes.


439
0:30:59,704 --> 0:31:2,499
No more about being
half white or half black.


440
0:31:2,499 --> 0:31:5,293
It's just one... one love.


441
0:31:5,293 --> 0:31:9,172
One love
One heart


442
0:31:9,172 --> 0:31:13,551
Let's join together
and I'll feel all right


443
0:31:13,551 --> 0:31:17,722
One love
One heart


444
0:31:17,722 --> 0:31:21,142
Let's join together
and I will feel all right


445
0:31:21,142 --> 0:31:24,562
 Undaunted by the driving rain,
a sea of faces awaited...


446
0:31:24,562 --> 0:31:27,816
at the Palisadoes Airport
the arrival of a living legend.


447
0:31:27,816 --> 0:31:30,318
For some,
he was the King of Kings.


448
0:31:30,318 --> 0:31:32,237
The Lion of Judah...


449
0:31:32,237 --> 0:31:33,321
even a god.


450
0:31:33,321 --> 0:31:36,408
Members of a local cult,
the Rastafarians,


451
0:31:36,408 --> 0:31:43,873
who worship this figure as a deity,
were present in full force.


452
0:31:43,873 --> 0:31:46,793
His Imperial Majesty,
Haile Selassie I,


453
0:31:46,793 --> 0:31:49,212
Emperor of Ethiopia, arrived.


454
0:31:49,212 --> 0:31:54,592
 When the plane landed,
thousands ran out and surrounded the plane.


455
0:31:54,592 --> 0:31:57,929
Some of them smoking.
Our police were powerless.


456
0:31:57,929 --> 0:32:1,975
And Selassie came to the door
of the plane, I remember,


457
0:32:1,975 --> 0:32:6,354
and after about 20 minutes
and he just looked and went back in.


458
0:32:6,354 --> 0:32:10,358
It took a long time
to get him off the plane.


459
0:32:10,358 --> 0:32:13,945
 So he came off the plane
and he greet, and I say...


460
0:32:13,945 --> 0:32:15,905
I say, "Wait, but this is a little man.


461
0:32:15,905 --> 0:32:19,951
There is this little man they say is God.
Them crazy."


462
0:32:19,951 --> 0:32:23,705
- I sit there on my bicycle,
waiting on him.


463
0:32:23,705 --> 0:32:26,499
And when him come up,
he look right in my face.


464
0:32:26,499 --> 0:32:30,628
It was like him look
into everybody face.


465
0:32:30,628 --> 0:32:33,256
But he look upon everyone.


466
0:32:33,256 --> 0:32:35,175
I remember, I see that.


467
0:32:35,175 --> 0:32:37,802
 And he just
turn his head around...


468
0:32:37,802 --> 0:32:39,721
and he was looking straight at me.


469
0:32:39,721 --> 0:32:42,974
And he did like this.


470
0:32:42,974 --> 0:32:44,225
And I look and I look,


471
0:32:44,225 --> 0:32:48,771
and I saw his hand,
and I saw a mark in his hand.


472
0:32:48,771 --> 0:32:53,67
And believe you, my brother,
when I saw that I went crazy.


473
0:32:53,67 --> 0:32:56,154
I run all the way back
to Trench Town.


474
0:32:56,154 --> 0:33:13,546
Take your troubles to Selassie


475
0:33:13,546 --> 0:33:21,387
He is the only King of Kings


476
0:33:21,387 --> 0:33:24,682
King of Kings


477
0:33:24,682 --> 0:33:31,689
King of Kings Selassie


478
0:33:31,689 --> 0:33:35,527
 The deeper Bob got
into the faith... the Rastafarian faith...


479
0:33:35,527 --> 0:33:41,324
the more his music
became entwined.


480
0:33:41,324 --> 0:33:45,662
- He was very into the social
commentary side of the music.


481
0:33:45,662 --> 0:33:49,82
Mr. Dodd didn't like that because
it wasn't commercial enough.


482
0:33:49,82 --> 0:33:52,252
So he was a little frustrated
because he couldn't do the music...


483
0:33:52,252 --> 0:33:55,296
the way he really wanted it to be done.


484
0:33:55,296 --> 0:33:59,926
 And also at that time,
money was a problem.


485
0:33:59,926 --> 0:34:4,597
Coxsone wasn't the kind of person
at the time to argue money with,


486
0:34:4,597 --> 0:34:7,58
unless you were willing
to go to war.


487
0:34:7,58 --> 0:34:9,686
 When you go
and ask him for your money,


488
0:34:9,686 --> 0:34:12,772
he usually like to bring off
some bad boy style.


489
0:34:12,772 --> 0:34:15,316
'Cause he has his thugs around him.


490
0:34:15,316 --> 0:34:18,236
You know what I mean?
Enforcer type of guys.


491
0:34:18,236 --> 0:34:21,447
- It was traditional in those days...


492
0:34:21,447 --> 0:34:25,368
that artists who recorded
never made money...


493
0:34:25,368 --> 0:34:28,204
because the record company
who collected the money...


494
0:34:28,204 --> 0:34:29,914
never gave the artist any money.


495
0:34:29,914 --> 0:34:32,375
- Yeah, we got paid
like minimum wage.


496
0:34:32,375 --> 0:34:35,587
Three pounds a week, that's it.
Each.


497
0:34:35,587 --> 0:34:37,589
- You couldn't live off it.


498
0:34:37,589 --> 0:34:39,757
 Could Bob live off it?
- Nah, mon.


499
0:34:39,757 --> 0:34:43,928
That's why Bob had to leave
and start doing his own thing.


500
0:34:43,928 --> 0:34:47,348
 So Robert left the group
to go to Delaware,


501
0:34:47,348 --> 0:34:48,516
to the United States.


502
0:34:48,516 --> 0:34:52,77
To migrate.


503
0:34:52,77 --> 0:35:0,528



504
0:35:0,528 --> 0:35:3,364
Gotta hold on to
this feeling we got


505
0:35:3,364 --> 0:35:5,491
We gonna blow blow blow


506
0:35:5,491 --> 0:35:8,87
'Cause we love love love you now


507
0:35:8,87 --> 0:35:13,499
- Yeah, well that was a marriage
that I wasn't invited to, nor Peter.


508
0:35:13,499 --> 0:35:19,5
But because he's our brother
we lived with it.


509
0:35:19,5 --> 0:35:21,174
 We got married, like,
on the 11th.


510
0:35:21,174 --> 0:35:25,386
And he left on the 12th of February.


511
0:35:25,386 --> 0:35:30,892



512
0:35:30,892 --> 0:35:33,561
Run for cover


513
0:35:33,561 --> 0:35:35,563
Run for cover


514
0:35:35,563 --> 0:35:37,148
Rain is taking over


515
0:35:37,148 --> 0:35:38,816



516
0:35:38,816 --> 0:35:41,694
Taking over


517
0:35:41,694 --> 0:35:43,529
 He came here...
his mother wants him here.


518
0:35:43,529 --> 0:35:47,33
Bob loved his mother.


519
0:35:47,33 --> 0:35:51,37
 He got a job at the du Pont Hotel
vacuuming the floor.


520
0:35:51,37 --> 0:35:53,831
Then he got a job at Chrysler.


521
0:35:53,831 --> 0:35:56,751
- When he was working there,
he used to...


522
0:35:56,751 --> 0:36:0,4
I think he used to drive
one of the forklift.


523
0:36:0,4 --> 0:36:4,884
I think he have a song out
of that driving the forklift all night.


524
0:36:4,884 --> 0:36:7,804
I'm working all night


525
0:36:7,804 --> 0:36:10,181
Got to be all right


526
0:36:10,181 --> 0:36:13,393
See I work for my bread


527
0:36:13,393 --> 0:36:15,103
All right


528
0:36:15,103 --> 0:36:17,63
Night and day
All night


529
0:36:17,63 --> 0:36:18,69
Work for my pay


530
0:36:18,69 --> 0:36:22,11
All right
Night and day


531
0:36:22,11 --> 0:36:27,73
No no no no no no


532
0:36:27,73 --> 0:36:31,119
No no no no no no


533
0:36:31,119 --> 0:36:34,414
Can you feel it
No no no no no no


534
0:36:34,414 --> 0:36:37,41
- Well, he was just very humble,
very loving,


535
0:36:37,41 --> 0:36:40,128
and he was very quiet, really.


536
0:36:40,128 --> 0:36:42,46
 Was he smoking
a lot of ganja then?


537
0:36:42,46 --> 0:36:45,883
- Yeah, he was growing it too,
man, in his backyard,


538
0:36:45,883 --> 0:36:49,137
and he had a row of herb plants,


539
0:36:49,137 --> 0:36:52,14
I mean towering in the air,
and I couldn't believe it.


540
0:36:52,14 --> 0:36:54,308
'Cause at that time
in Wilmington, Delaware,


541
0:36:54,308 --> 0:36:58,604
man, they were kicking
people's doors in for a little joint.


542
0:36:58,604 --> 0:37:0,523
- I used to go up to his house
and we'd go in the basement.


543
0:37:0,523 --> 0:37:3,484
He'd play his guitar, and I would play
my congas. I played congas.


544
0:37:3,484 --> 0:37:4,736
And we would just jam.


545
0:37:4,736 --> 0:37:9,24
And I didn't really realize
he was such a great musician.


546
0:37:9,24 --> 0:37:11,534
 But he never gave up music,


547
0:37:11,534 --> 0:37:14,245
'cause his mummy,
she would write me to say,


548
0:37:14,245 --> 0:37:17,832
"All Nesta does
is stay in the basement...


549
0:37:17,832 --> 0:37:19,792
and play his guitar."


550
0:37:19,792 --> 0:37:24,797
 Well, I couldn't stand it.
I wasn't doing what I wanted to do.


551
0:37:24,797 --> 0:37:28,259
So I went back to Jamaica,
where I must get more freedom.


552
0:37:28,259 --> 0:37:32,388
Bend down low


553
0:37:32,388 --> 0:37:37,643
Let me tell you what I know yeah


554
0:37:37,643 --> 0:37:42,982
Bend down low


555
0:37:42,982 --> 0:37:45,151
 When Robbie came back
from the U.S.,


556
0:37:45,151 --> 0:37:50,782
we decided to start our own independent
label, "Wail'n Soul'm."


557
0:37:50,782 --> 0:37:54,66
So we went in and did
"Bend Down Low."


558
0:37:54,66 --> 0:37:57,663
"Bend Down Low" was a number one.


559
0:37:57,663 --> 0:38:0,458
We started to build our own economy.


560
0:38:0,458 --> 0:38:4,295
We used to ride with our bicycles
and distribute the records to jukeboxes,


561
0:38:4,295 --> 0:38:8,174
sound systems, record stores,
with our bicycles.


562
0:38:8,174 --> 0:38:10,843
- The Wailers' music
dominated the dance halls.


563
0:38:10,843 --> 0:38:17,16
But it was hardly played
on our Jamaican radio stations.


564
0:38:17,16 --> 0:38:19,852
 In the music business,
they were just prejudiced.


565
0:38:19,852 --> 0:38:22,188
The first problem is being a Rasta.


566
0:38:22,188 --> 0:38:25,733
And the next problem is that
you're not with the big companies.


567
0:38:25,733 --> 0:38:27,985
So that's a...
that's a heavy load to carry.


568
0:38:27,985 --> 0:38:31,155
 These disc jockeys,
when they went on air,


569
0:38:31,155 --> 0:38:32,49
they had their own program sometime.


570
0:38:32,49 --> 0:38:35,326
They had their own
sorts of records from these...


571
0:38:35,326 --> 0:38:38,162
these different companies
that they would have to play.


572
0:38:38,162 --> 0:38:42,41
Sometimes we were not included.
So to be included in that,


573
0:38:42,41 --> 0:38:44,418
we had to get real tough sometimes.


574
0:38:44,418 --> 0:38:47,338
- I used to drive Bob with "Skill" Cole...


575
0:38:47,338 --> 0:38:48,631
- Yeah.


576
0:38:48,631 --> 0:38:50,383
- And Frowser and Tek-Life.


577
0:38:50,383 --> 0:38:52,885
Do you remember them,
these two little gangsters?


578
0:38:52,885 --> 0:38:54,262
- Yeah. Right.


579
0:38:54,262 --> 0:38:56,222
Yeah.


580
0:38:56,222 --> 0:38:59,183
- I used to drive to the radio
station, right? - Right.


581
0:38:59,183 --> 0:39:2,103
- And they'd leave me in the car.
Right?


582
0:39:2,103 --> 0:39:4,272
And they'd go in.
Skill Cole had a baseball bat.


583
0:39:4,272 --> 0:39:6,65
You know they don't play baseball
in Jamaica.


584
0:39:6,65 --> 0:39:8,25
I don't know where
he got a baseball bat.


585
0:39:8,25 --> 0:39:10,236
And Skill Cole was big... A big guy.
- Yeah.


586
0:39:10,236 --> 0:39:12,697
- Right?
They'd go in the radio station.


587
0:39:12,697 --> 0:39:16,784
They'd have me listen
to the radio...


588
0:39:16,784 --> 0:39:19,78
to make sure that they're really


589
0:39:19,78 --> 0:39:23,291
playing the record.
- Right.


590
0:39:23,291 --> 0:39:26,752
And then Coxsone, Studio 1,


591
0:39:26,752 --> 0:39:30,923
Dualcreed, Trojan
and Prince Buster...


592
0:39:30,923 --> 0:39:35,94
decide to form an organization
called "The Big Tree."


593
0:39:35,94 --> 0:39:38,556
Then the Wailers pulled the ax.


594
0:39:38,556 --> 0:39:42,518
If you are a big tree


595
0:39:42,518 --> 0:39:46,188
We are the small ax


596
0:39:46,188 --> 0:39:49,483
Sharpened to cut you down


597
0:39:49,483 --> 0:39:51,11
Well sharp


598
0:39:51,11 --> 0:40:24,268
To cut you down


599
0:40:24,268 --> 0:40:28,689
 Lee Perry used to work
with Coxsone.


600
0:40:28,689 --> 0:40:32,276
So when he started doing
his independent business,


601
0:40:32,276 --> 0:40:41,452
we admired him, because he follow
our footstep out of Coxsone.


602
0:40:41,452 --> 0:40:43,454
 My experience of "Scratch" is that,


603
0:40:43,454 --> 0:40:46,832
number one,
he's a very innovative producer.


604
0:40:46,832 --> 0:40:48,793
Very creative.


605
0:40:48,793 --> 0:40:51,671
I mean, to the point
that it became an excitement...


606
0:40:51,671 --> 0:40:55,591
to see him come into the studio
with a half flask of white rum...


607
0:40:55,591 --> 0:40:58,761
and sprinkle the four corners
of the studio with it.


608
0:40:58,761 --> 0:41:0,137
Flash.


609
0:41:0,137 --> 0:41:2,848
And then he would go into his little...


610
0:41:2,848 --> 0:41:5,351
You know, he would, like, dance.


611
0:41:5,351 --> 0:41:8,2
He didn't write music scores.
He would say, you know,


612
0:41:8,2 --> 0:41:9,563
"Snap, I want you to play this,"
you know?


613
0:41:9,563 --> 0:41:12,66
And he would just hop
through the music, you know?


614
0:41:12,66 --> 0:41:15,277
And they...
they would follow him.


615
0:41:15,277 --> 0:41:18,3
I would believe that his early
recordings with the Wailers


616
0:41:18,3 --> 0:41:20,491
were the best to my knowledge.


617
0:41:20,491 --> 0:41:32,211
Perry had a lot of influence
on Bob's, uh, career.


618
0:41:32,211 --> 0:41:39,343
These are the words of my master


619
0:41:39,343 --> 0:41:50,62



620
0:41:50,62 --> 0:41:52,898
 Why do people like his music
so much though?


621
0:41:52,898 --> 0:42:37,151



622
0:42:37,151 --> 0:42:38,819
- It is mentioned often in the Bible...


623
0:42:38,819 --> 0:42:43,199
that there shall be a music
that all people of all global concerns...


624
0:42:43,199 --> 0:42:45,701
shall play and dance
and sing this music.


625
0:42:45,701 --> 0:42:47,536
It's in the Revelation.


626
0:42:47,536 --> 0:42:50,664
What other music could that be?


627
0:42:50,664 --> 0:42:53,542
Reggae.


628
0:42:53,542 --> 0:42:57,171
- What really changed it to reggae...


629
0:42:57,171 --> 0:43:0,91
was the riff actually with the guitar.


630
0:43:0,91 --> 0:43:2,384
It just basically a rhythm change...


631
0:43:2,384 --> 0:43:4,762
in terms of what the guitar...


632
0:43:4,762 --> 0:43:7,306
the guitar used to play
like cha, cha, cha.


633
0:43:7,306 --> 0:43:20,736
And then it start playing
chaka, chaka, chaka, chaka.


634
0:43:20,736 --> 0:43:25,991
Yes my friend


635
0:43:25,991 --> 0:43:30,121
We're in the streets again


636
0:43:30,121 --> 0:43:33,791
Sometimes some of these things happen
out of just maybe an accident.


637
0:43:33,791 --> 0:43:37,503
Somebody was doing something
and the producer went, "Hey, I like that."


638
0:43:37,503 --> 0:43:40,339
Can set me free again


639
0:43:40,339 --> 0:43:45,219
 Coxsone had bought a piece
of equipment from the United States.


640
0:43:45,219 --> 0:43:48,347
And it was in the studio for a long time
and no one knew what to do with it.


641
0:43:48,347 --> 0:43:50,391
They decided to hook it up.


642
0:43:50,391 --> 0:43:53,811
And when it was hooked up,
they realized it was a tape delay.


643
0:43:53,811 --> 0:43:55,479
So when you make one strum,


644
0:43:55,479 --> 0:43:58,566
it comes back at you
at the same time. "Chicka."


645
0:43:58,566 --> 0:44:2,403
And the other studios heard "Chicka"...


646
0:44:2,403 --> 0:44:4,446
and thought it was a guitar
making more sounds.


647
0:44:4,446 --> 0:44:10,369
So reggae, to my mind, actually
developed out of an illusion.


648
0:44:10,369 --> 0:44:13,38
So if you a bullbucka


649
0:44:13,38 --> 0:44:15,583
Let me tell you this


650
0:44:15,583 --> 0:44:20,963
I'm a duppy conqueror


651
0:44:20,963 --> 0:44:22,89
Conqueror


652
0:44:22,89 --> 0:44:24,425
 The beats are
bam, bam, bam, bam.


653
0:44:24,425 --> 0:44:27,428
With reggae you got three beats
out of four beats,


654
0:44:27,428 --> 0:44:29,138
and you imagine the next beat.


655
0:44:29,138 --> 0:44:31,599
Feel the next beat.
That's reggae.


656
0:44:31,599 --> 0:44:33,934
Feel. Heartbeat. Feel.


657
0:44:33,934 --> 0:44:37,521



658
0:44:37,521 --> 0:44:43,36



659
0:44:43,36 --> 0:44:45,863
Yeah.


660
0:44:45,863 --> 0:44:48,616
Heartbeats.


661
0:44:48,616 --> 0:44:50,117
Real deal.


662
0:44:50,117 --> 0:44:56,4
- The basic parts of the music
were the drum and the bass.


663
0:44:56,4 --> 0:45:5,132
Because, you know, drums are
the first instruments in music.


664
0:45:5,132 --> 0:45:7,718
So the drum is the heartbeat,


665
0:45:7,718 --> 0:45:10,304
and the bass, it is the backbone.


666
0:45:10,304 --> 0:45:13,307
 Well, I think
the drum and bass...


667
0:45:13,307 --> 0:45:15,559
play a very important part
in Bob's music.


668
0:45:15,559 --> 0:45:18,562
It was, you know, "Family Man"
and Carlton... two brothers.


669
0:45:18,562 --> 0:45:20,898
They have their own style.


670
0:45:20,898 --> 0:45:24,86
Stir it up


671
0:45:24,86 --> 0:45:27,71
Little darlin'


672
0:45:27,71 --> 0:45:29,782
Stir it up


673
0:45:29,782 --> 0:45:31,992
Come on baby


674
0:45:31,992 --> 0:45:36,58
 Reggae is a concept
of all different type of music.


675
0:45:36,58 --> 0:45:40,459
You got funk.
You got rhythm and blues.


676
0:45:40,459 --> 0:45:42,962
You got soul.


677
0:45:42,962 --> 0:45:46,298
And then very jazzy when it's ready.


678
0:45:46,298 --> 0:45:50,219
It's been a long long time


679
0:45:50,219 --> 0:45:55,724
Since I've got you on my mind


680
0:45:55,724 --> 0:45:58,31
Whoa whoa whoo yeah


681
0:45:58,31 --> 0:46:1,355
And now you are here


682
0:46:1,355 --> 0:46:5,234
I say it's so clear


683
0:46:5,234 --> 0:46:9,29
To see what we could do baby


684
0:46:9,29 --> 0:46:10,99
Just me and you


685
0:46:10,99 --> 0:46:15,536
Come on and stir it up


686
0:46:15,536 --> 0:46:20,708
Little darlin'
Stir it up


687
0:46:20,708 --> 0:46:24,3
Come on baby


688
0:46:24,3 --> 0:46:28,882
Come on and stir it up


689
0:46:28,882 --> 0:46:37,308
Little darlin'
Stir it up


690
0:46:37,308 --> 0:46:40,811
- I was working with a company
called National Dry Cleaners.


691
0:46:40,811 --> 0:46:43,397
And I was in charge of a branch.


692
0:46:43,397 --> 0:46:46,358
And Rita came in one day
with some clothes to,


693
0:46:46,358 --> 0:46:48,235
you know, to be dry-cleaned.


694
0:46:48,235 --> 0:46:51,947
She gave out the clothes
and she said, "Rita Marley."


695
0:46:51,947 --> 0:46:54,116
So I was quite surprised,


696
0:46:54,116 --> 0:46:57,244
because, I mean, the only Marley I know
was the white Marleys.


697
0:46:57,244 --> 0:46:59,33
I call them the white Marleys.


698
0:46:59,33 --> 0:47:2,583
And, uh, so I said, "Who is Marley?"


699
0:47:2,583 --> 0:47:5,2
She said, "Well, that's my husband."


700
0:47:5,2 --> 0:47:6,962
And I said, "Who is his father?"


701
0:47:6,962 --> 0:47:10,799
She said she don't know much about him,
but she know they call him Captain Marley.


702
0:47:10,799 --> 0:47:15,22
And then I said, "That's my father."


703
0:47:15,22 --> 0:47:18,57
My mother used to work
in a boardinghouse,


704
0:47:18,57 --> 0:47:20,976
and my dad would stay there
when he comes from...


705
0:47:20,976 --> 0:47:25,23
from sea or wherever he goes,
and that's how she met him.


706
0:47:25,23 --> 0:47:28,192
 And did they have a long
relationship or was it very brief?


707
0:47:28,192 --> 0:47:31,236
- I think it was very brief.


708
0:47:31,236 --> 0:47:37,409
My mother didn't really know
what happened to him.


709
0:47:37,409 --> 0:47:40,287
 In Jamaica,
used to have a big company.


710
0:47:40,287 --> 0:47:43,4
Established company
named Marley and Plant.


711
0:47:43,4 --> 0:47:45,376
They did construction,
Marley and Plant.


712
0:47:45,376 --> 0:47:49,213
Most of the construction jobs
in and around the country.


713
0:47:49,213 --> 0:47:52,216
That was the company who did it.


714
0:47:52,216 --> 0:47:54,802
And he always said
those were his family.


715
0:47:54,802 --> 0:47:57,12
- Yeah, I remember one time, I think,


716
0:47:57,12 --> 0:48:0,391
him go to them to try borrow
some money to buy a car,


717
0:48:0,391 --> 0:48:4,728
you know, so they can
deliver the records.


718
0:48:4,728 --> 0:48:7,106
And the story goes,
when he walked in the office,


719
0:48:7,106 --> 0:48:10,943
like the whole staff turned around
'cause he looked so much like them.


720
0:48:10,943 --> 0:48:13,153



721
0:48:13,153 --> 0:48:15,364
- They told us to go away.


722
0:48:15,364 --> 0:48:19,76
They know nothing
about Norval having a baby.


723
0:48:19,76 --> 0:48:22,871
- Knowing my father, as I do, um,


724
0:48:22,871 --> 0:48:25,541
I don't know how strong
the word rejected is.


725
0:48:25,541 --> 0:48:29,545
But he might have
been rejected, for sure,


726
0:48:29,545 --> 0:48:34,925
because, um, a different era
and my father was a disciplinarian,


727
0:48:34,925 --> 0:48:37,886
and he was quite
a stern man in his own way.


728
0:48:37,886 --> 0:48:44,601
In those days Rastafarians weren't
as socially accepted as they are now.


729
0:48:44,601 --> 0:48:48,272
- He said to me, "When all this happened,
it gave me more strength...


730
0:48:48,272 --> 0:48:50,399
because I went to write a song."


731
0:48:50,399 --> 0:48:52,818
You know, write a song.
I said "What song?"


732
0:48:52,818 --> 0:48:55,404
He said, "Try to pick it up."
He said, "The stone the builder refuse.


733
0:48:55,404 --> 0:48:57,531
I'm the stone. I'm the one."


734
0:48:57,531 --> 0:49:2,77
 I just wanted to play you a song...
which we were told, Bob,


735
0:49:2,77 --> 0:49:5,747
after he went to see your father
and he felt rejected,


736
0:49:5,747 --> 0:49:8,83
he wrote this song
about that experience.


737
0:49:8,83 --> 0:49:10,335
I'm just very curious to know
what you think of it.


738
0:49:10,335 --> 0:49:14,631
- Oh, really? I'd be interested.
I'd be interested to hear it.


739
0:49:14,631 --> 0:49:26,435



740
0:49:26,435 --> 0:49:30,355
The stone that the builder refused


741
0:49:30,355 --> 0:49:33,984
Will always be the head cornerstone


742
0:49:33,984 --> 0:49:44,411
Sing it brother


743
0:49:44,411 --> 0:49:46,872
- Nice song.


744
0:49:46,872 --> 0:49:50,292
You're a builder baby


745
0:49:50,292 --> 0:49:55,214
Here I am a stone


746
0:49:55,214 --> 0:49:59,551
Don't you pick and refuse me


747
0:49:59,551 --> 0:50:1,97
'Cause the things people refuse


748
0:50:1,97 --> 0:50:4,515
Are the things they should use


749
0:50:4,515 --> 0:50:6,85
Do you hear me


750
0:50:6,85 --> 0:50:9,645
Hear what I say


751
0:50:9,645 --> 0:50:14,149
- I've heard this song before,
but I never placed any significance in it.


752
0:50:14,149 --> 0:50:18,612
But I can see where
what you're saying could be so.


753
0:50:18,612 --> 0:50:21,365
Mm-hmm.


754
0:50:21,365 --> 0:50:24,34
- Am I allowed to talk?
- Mm-hmm.


755
0:50:24,34 --> 0:50:27,371
- Yeah, how true that is.


756
0:50:27,371 --> 0:50:32,96
'Cause Bob put the Marley name
in the world, you know?


757
0:50:32,96 --> 0:50:38,966
He filled the world with the Marleys
by all his music and his children's.


758
0:50:38,966 --> 0:50:42,678
And he now becomes the Marley.


759
0:50:42,678 --> 0:50:45,222
You know what I mean?
He now becomes the Marley,


760
0:50:45,222 --> 0:50:51,103
and nobody knows what happened
to the rest that used to be so...


761
0:50:51,103 --> 0:50:53,272
adored and wonderful.


762
0:50:53,272 --> 0:50:56,66
They're in the background now,
and he's in the forefront.


763
0:50:56,66 --> 0:51:2,489
Isn't that amazing?
Yes. Yes. Truly.


764
0:51:2,489 --> 0:51:6,535
The stone that the builder refused


765
0:51:6,535 --> 0:51:12,124
Will always be the head cornerstone


766
0:51:12,124 --> 0:51:14,876
- I think what happened to him...
that rejection...


767
0:51:14,876 --> 0:51:18,255
that is why he was able
to reach the world.


768
0:51:18,255 --> 0:51:21,675
And I think there are so many people
out there that are hurting.


769
0:51:21,675 --> 0:51:24,928
So many people out there that have felt
what I have been through,


770
0:51:24,928 --> 0:51:41,236
and I have a message that can bring change
and transformation.


771
0:51:41,236 --> 0:51:45,782
No woman no cry


772
0:51:45,782 --> 0:51:50,912
No woman no cry


773
0:51:50,912 --> 0:51:55,792
No woman no cry


774
0:51:55,792 --> 0:51:59,671
No woman no cry


775
0:51:59,671 --> 0:52:1,89
'Cause 'cause


776
0:52:1,89 --> 0:52:5,927
'Cause I remember
when we used to sit


777
0:52:5,927 --> 0:52:10,849
In the government yard
in Trench Town


778
0:52:10,849 --> 0:52:15,52
Oba observing
the hypocrites yeah


779
0:52:15,52 --> 0:52:20,233
Mingle with the good people
we meet yeah


780
0:52:20,233 --> 0:52:25,489
Good friends we have
Oh good friends we've lost


781
0:52:25,489 --> 0:52:29,868
Along the way yeah


782
0:52:29,868 --> 0:52:34,831
In this great future
you can't forget your past


783
0:52:34,831 --> 0:52:38,502
So dry your tears I say


784
0:52:38,502 --> 0:52:39,836
Yeah


785
0:52:39,836 --> 0:52:42,673
Everything's gonna be all right


786
0:52:42,673 --> 0:52:44,716
Everything's gonna be all right


787
0:52:44,716 --> 0:52:47,52
Everything's gonna be all right


788
0:52:47,52 --> 0:52:49,513
Everything's gonna be all right


789
0:52:49,513 --> 0:52:51,973
Everything's gonna be all right


790
0:52:51,973 --> 0:52:54,101
Everything's gonna be all right


791
0:52:54,101 --> 0:52:57,62
Everything's gonna be all right


792
0:52:57,62 --> 0:52:59,773
Everything's gonna be all right


793
0:52:59,773 --> 0:53:1,9
Everything's gonna be all right


794
0:53:1,9 --> 0:53:4,152
Everything's gonna be all right


795
0:53:4,152 --> 0:53:6,78
Everything's gonna be all right


796
0:53:6,78 --> 0:53:9,157
Everything's gonna be all right


797
0:53:9,157 --> 0:53:15,622
Everything's gonna be all right


798
0:53:15,622 --> 0:53:17,999



799
0:53:17,999 --> 0:53:21,169



800
0:53:21,169 --> 0:53:23,588
 Somebody rang me and said,
"Oh, by the way,


801
0:53:23,588 --> 0:53:27,259
Bob Marley and the Wailers are in London.
Would you like to meet them?"


802
0:53:27,259 --> 0:53:29,72
I was intrigued to meet them
because, you know,


803
0:53:29,72 --> 0:53:35,934
you'd heard a lot about them by now.


804
0:53:35,934 --> 0:53:39,479
When they came in the office,
they were just really impressive.


805
0:53:39,479 --> 0:53:42,607
Very charismatic.


806
0:53:42,607 --> 0:53:46,319
I just said to go make an album
and asked them how much they thought.


807
0:53:46,319 --> 0:53:51,908
They told me, and I gave them
the money to do that.


808
0:53:51,908 --> 0:53:56,663
We took 4,000 pounds and
did the Catch a Fire album.


809
0:53:56,663 --> 0:53:59,4
 I was trying to get across
that this is a black rock act.


810
0:53:59,4 --> 0:54:1,418
That's how I wanted it
to be perceived.


811
0:54:1,418 --> 0:54:3,795
Get up stand up


812
0:54:3,795 --> 0:54:6,798
Stand up for your rights


813
0:54:6,798 --> 0:54:9,926
Get up stand up


814
0:54:9,926 --> 0:54:12,637
Stand up for your rights


815
0:54:12,637 --> 0:54:14,973
Get up stand up


816
0:54:14,973 --> 0:54:22,22
And don't give up the fight


817
0:54:22,22 --> 0:54:26,109
My sense is that Bob
was ready to give it a try,


818
0:54:26,109 --> 0:54:31,198
and that the others weren't that keen.


819
0:54:31,198 --> 0:54:34,868
 The frame of mind that Bob was in,
he didn't mind it.


820
0:54:34,868 --> 0:54:37,329
He said, "I had to start somewhere."


821
0:54:37,329 --> 0:54:38,622
He always said it.


822
0:54:38,622 --> 0:54:40,832
"If you don't start somewhere,
you're not gonna get nowhere."


823
0:54:40,832 --> 0:54:43,877
Get up stand up


824
0:54:43,877 --> 0:54:46,838
Stand up for your rights


825
0:54:46,838 --> 0:54:50,5
Get up stand up


826
0:54:50,5 --> 0:54:52,844
 Bob wanted it to reach
not just the Jamaicans...


827
0:54:52,844 --> 0:54:55,722
Bob wanted it to reach
the American market.


828
0:54:55,722 --> 0:54:58,141
He wanted it to reach
the European market.


829
0:54:58,141 --> 0:55:1,52
And in order to do that,
you had to flavor it that way.


830
0:55:1,52 --> 0:55:4,231
Stand up for your rights


831
0:55:4,231 --> 0:55:7,67
Get up stand up


832
0:55:7,67 --> 0:55:15,534
And don't give up the fight


833
0:55:15,534 --> 0:55:17,494
Ital.


834
0:55:17,494 --> 0:55:21,331
Irie.


835
0:55:21,331 --> 0:55:23,959
 The first record
is easily the most,


836
0:55:23,959 --> 0:55:26,67
for want of a better word, pasteurized.


837
0:55:26,67 --> 0:55:29,13
I added sort of different things into it.


838
0:55:29,13 --> 0:55:42,978
- All those guitars and the keyboards
are all overdubs.


839
0:55:42,978 --> 0:55:49,15
No sun will shine in my day today


840
0:55:49,15 --> 0:55:52,904
No sun will shine


841
0:55:52,904 --> 0:55:57,993
The high yellow moon
won't come out to play


842
0:55:57,993 --> 0:56:1,413
Won't come out to play


843
0:56:1,413 --> 0:56:8,3
I said darkness
has covered my light


844
0:56:8,3 --> 0:56:13,3
And has changed my day
into night yeah


845
0:56:13,3 --> 0:56:19,55
Where is the love to be found


846
0:56:19,55 --> 0:56:21,808
Won't someone tell me


847
0:56:21,808 --> 0:56:24,102
 I had no doubt
that it would succeed.


848
0:56:24,102 --> 0:56:26,146
I had no doubt.


849
0:56:26,146 --> 0:56:28,481
The only thing that
could stop it succeeding...


850
0:56:28,481 --> 0:56:30,525
is if I couldn't get them to tour.


851
0:56:30,525 --> 0:56:32,11
That was my only fear.


852
0:56:32,11 --> 0:56:34,29
Concrete jungle


853
0:56:34,29 --> 0:56:38,116
I say where the living is hardest


854
0:56:38,116 --> 0:56:39,576
 They went on this famous tour,


855
0:56:39,576 --> 0:56:41,661
and things went wrong.


856
0:56:41,661 --> 0:56:43,413
Things went sour.


857
0:56:43,413 --> 0:56:47,417
- We did a tour of England
of the Catch a Fire album,


858
0:56:47,417 --> 0:56:51,4
but no one told us that
it was a promotional tour,


859
0:56:51,4 --> 0:56:54,9
so we wouldn't be getting any money.


860
0:56:54,9 --> 0:56:56,217
 You're top group in Jamaica now,


861
0:56:56,217 --> 0:57:0,764
and you probably think that going
to England is going to be the same.


862
0:57:0,764 --> 0:57:2,432
Bob was more real.


863
0:57:2,432 --> 0:57:5,518
'Cause he said to me,
"Eh, nobody know the Wailers."


864
0:57:5,518 --> 0:57:8,855
- I think Bob recognized he needed
to get out there and do it,


865
0:57:8,855 --> 0:57:10,941
and I think the others were not sure.


866
0:57:10,941 --> 0:57:13,234
It's like grassroots, you know?


867
0:57:13,234 --> 0:57:16,947
You're on a bus all night,
schlepping up and down the motorway,


868
0:57:16,947 --> 0:57:18,99
eating terrible food.


869
0:57:18,99 --> 0:57:20,909
You know, it's rough.


870
0:57:20,909 --> 0:57:25,246
In the case of Bunny, I think he just
didn't want to be in the cold and the snow.


871
0:57:25,246 --> 0:57:31,378
He just... it just wasn't worth it to him.


872
0:57:31,378 --> 0:57:34,214
 Bob wanted success.


873
0:57:34,214 --> 0:57:36,633
Bunny and Peter were more militant.


874
0:57:36,633 --> 0:57:39,26
People wanted to separate them...


875
0:57:39,26 --> 0:57:43,64
because they didn't want
to deal with Bunny and Peter.


876
0:57:43,64 --> 0:57:46,59
- When you say people,
do you mean Island Records?


877
0:57:46,59 --> 0:57:47,56
- Of course.


878
0:57:47,56 --> 0:57:50,23
- The American leg was next.


879
0:57:50,23 --> 0:57:53,817
So I said, "Are we going to get
some money out of this leg?"


880
0:57:53,817 --> 0:57:58,989
Chris Blackwell said, no, because
you're gonna be doing freak clubs.


881
0:57:58,989 --> 0:58:3,535
You know, a place where
all kinds of immoral, mix-up things.


882
0:58:3,535 --> 0:58:7,38
I say, "Chris
you know that we are Rastas.


883
0:58:7,38 --> 0:58:10,458
Why are you exposing us
to them kind of situations there?"


884
0:58:10,458 --> 0:58:14,212
"Well, if the Wailers don't do those clubs,
they're nobody."


885
0:58:14,212 --> 0:58:18,466
So I said, "Yeah?
So I'm not going on this tour.


886
0:58:18,466 --> 0:58:21,553
This leg, I'm coming off."


887
0:58:21,553 --> 0:58:23,763
And my brothers, I thought,
would have done the same...


888
0:58:23,763 --> 0:58:26,683
as the conversation affected them both.


889
0:58:26,683 --> 0:58:31,938
But I was left to look as if
I was the only cold front.


890
0:58:31,938 --> 0:58:38,319
So I hold my position anyway,
and still holds my position.


891
0:58:38,319 --> 0:58:49,998



892
0:58:49,998 --> 0:58:55,962
Stop that train I'm leaving


893
0:58:55,962 --> 0:59:2,177
Stop that train I'm leaving


894
0:59:2,177 --> 0:59:4,679
 Peter was
a militant type of guy.


895
0:59:4,679 --> 0:59:7,891
And I think he didn't like
Chris Blackwell too much.


896
0:59:7,891 --> 0:59:12,479
He figured Chris Blackwell
was ripping them off.


897
0:59:12,479 --> 0:59:15,65
- Well, the time came about '74...


898
0:59:15,65 --> 0:59:18,68
when we did two L.P.'s
with Chris "Whitewell."


899
0:59:18,68 --> 0:59:21,196
And the way he intend to handle us...


900
0:59:21,196 --> 0:59:25,75
was like we were unprofessional,
or we were just beginners,


901
0:59:25,75 --> 0:59:27,41
which I did not appreciate.


902
0:59:27,41 --> 0:59:31,748
But after 12 years of being
a background vocalist with the Wailers,


903
0:59:31,748 --> 0:59:34,25
I didn't get much access of saying,


904
0:59:34,25 --> 0:59:36,961
or materializing what was in me.


905
0:59:36,961 --> 0:59:39,422
And that was totally
depreciating my ability.


906
0:59:39,422 --> 0:59:42,926
So I left because I need recognition


907
0:59:42,926 --> 1:0:2,153
and respect.


908
1:0:2,153 --> 1:0:6,241
 For us as his children
he wasn't like a lovey-dovey daddy.


909
1:0:6,241 --> 1:0:9,16
Uh, you know,
a daddy who would, you know...


910
1:0:9,16 --> 1:0:13,873
"Oh, be careful, Son."


911
1:0:13,873 --> 1:0:15,416
Him was a rough man.


912
1:0:15,416 --> 1:0:19,712
Him was rough, you know?
Rough, rough, rough.


913
1:0:19,712 --> 1:0:28,12



914
1:0:28,12 --> 1:0:30,807
 We were always active.
You know, like, we're on the beach.


915
1:0:30,807 --> 1:0:33,81
We're running.
We're racing each other.


916
1:0:33,81 --> 1:0:37,23
It was always about racing
to see who could beat him.


917
1:0:37,23 --> 1:0:39,107
 I mean, there was
no let-up in him.


918
1:0:39,107 --> 1:0:42,318
There was no, like, "It's children.
Let me run slow."


919
1:0:42,318 --> 1:0:45,572



920
1:0:45,572 --> 1:0:49,2
The fastest he could run
against us he would.


921
1:0:49,2 --> 1:0:54,747
- And then he would find it hilarious,
and we didn't find it so funny.


922
1:0:54,747 --> 1:0:57,333
Yeah, nobody wanted
their children around...


923
1:0:57,333 --> 1:1:1,379
...us.


924
1:1:1,379 --> 1:1:4,382
"Nasty. Drug heads.


925
1:1:4,382 --> 1:1:8,928
All your parents do
is smoke weed and play music.


926
1:1:8,928 --> 1:1:12,599
And therefore
my kid cannot play with you."


927
1:1:12,599 --> 1:1:15,393
So it wasn't a positive thing.


928
1:1:15,393 --> 1:1:18,62
I would have friends who, like,
basically if they want to sleep over,


929
1:1:18,62 --> 1:1:21,691
they would have to tell their parents
they were sleeping somewhere else.


930
1:1:21,691 --> 1:1:24,194
He said, "You don't need friends.


931
1:1:24,194 --> 1:1:26,404
You have your brothers and your sisters.


932
1:1:26,404 --> 1:1:29,866
And that's all you need.


933
1:1:29,866 --> 1:1:34,12
Don't ever think
you'd need friends."


934
1:1:34,12 --> 1:1:37,665
- I feel Bob worked through
so many different experiences in life...


935
1:1:37,665 --> 1:1:41,794
that I don't think him
trust people so easy.


936
1:1:41,794 --> 1:1:47,634
So it's like, "Who really love me?"


937
1:1:47,634 --> 1:1:50,929
Play I some music


938
1:1:50,929 --> 1:1:54,182
Reggae music


939
1:1:54,182 --> 1:2:1,272
Play I some music
Dis a reggae music


940
1:2:1,272 --> 1:2:3,983
Roots rock reggae


941
1:2:3,983 --> 1:2:7,946
Dis a reggae music


942
1:2:7,946 --> 1:2:11,282
Roots rock reggae


943
1:2:11,282 --> 1:2:13,409
Dis a reggae music


944
1:2:13,409 --> 1:2:18,414
- Well, the harmony didn't change because
then Bob took hold of The I-Threes.


945
1:2:18,414 --> 1:2:22,252
Because he still wanted
to maintain that sound.


946
1:2:22,252 --> 1:2:25,588
I can't refuse it


947
1:2:25,588 --> 1:2:29,968
- And Bob invited us
to do the Natty Dread tour.


948
1:2:29,968 --> 1:2:32,53
Feel like dancing


949
1:2:32,53 --> 1:2:34,305
- From the very first show
it was just...


950
1:2:34,305 --> 1:2:36,683



951
1:2:36,683 --> 1:2:38,476
dynamite.


952
1:2:38,476 --> 1:2:44,65
I


953
1:2:44,65 --> 1:2:45,984
Rebel music


954
1:2:45,984 --> 1:2:49,279
- We sold out everything.
We're just doing clubs.


955
1:2:49,279 --> 1:2:52,31
But like the Paul's Mall in Boston...


956
1:2:52,31 --> 1:2:55,827
we did like something
like six nights straight.


957
1:2:55,827 --> 1:3:2,292
Rebel music


958
1:3:2,292 --> 1:3:7,964
It's that experience in a 400-seater,
500-seater at the Roxy.


959
1:3:7,964 --> 1:3:11,134
The Quiet Knight in Chicago,
another 500.


960
1:3:11,134 --> 1:3:13,303
That was the time to see Bob Marley,


961
1:3:13,303 --> 1:3:18,766
'cause you were as close to him
as I am to you now.


962
1:3:18,766 --> 1:3:20,852
 All the way from
Trench Town, Jamaica,


963
1:3:20,852 --> 1:3:22,312
Bob Marley and the Wailers.


964
1:3:22,312 --> 1:3:29,819
Come on!


965
1:3:29,819 --> 1:3:33,656
 This concert they did
in London in 1975... the Lyceum...


966
1:3:33,656 --> 1:3:35,575
that was the tipping point.


967
1:3:35,575 --> 1:3:38,703
After that, everybody knew his name.


968
1:3:38,703 --> 1:3:48,546
There was that sense
that he's about to be massive.


969
1:3:48,546 --> 1:3:54,93
Firstly, it was packed.
Over packed.


970
1:3:54,93 --> 1:3:57,55
When you're at a concert
and you've managed to get in,


971
1:3:57,55 --> 1:3:59,849
and there are X hundred people
outside who can't get in,


972
1:3:59,849 --> 1:4:1,184
you already feel great.


973
1:4:1,184 --> 1:4:3,186
And that energy you have


974
1:4:3,186 --> 1:4:5,355
spreads to the band
when they come on stage.


975
1:4:5,355 --> 1:4:8,24
And so they feel something.
And it was one of those things.


976
1:4:8,24 --> 1:4:11,194
It was just... just explosive.


977
1:4:11,194 --> 1:4:15,239
- When he walked on stage and he felt
the crowd moving the theater,


978
1:4:15,239 --> 1:4:18,701
it was like, "Yes."
You know, finally.


979
1:4:18,701 --> 1:4:24,707
No woman no cry


980
1:4:24,707 --> 1:4:31,464
No woman no cry


981
1:4:31,464 --> 1:4:37,95
No woman no cry


982
1:4:37,95 --> 1:4:41,391
No woman no cry


983
1:4:41,391 --> 1:4:43,726
Said said


984
1:4:43,726 --> 1:4:49,148
Said I remember
when we used to sit


985
1:4:49,148 --> 1:4:55,738
In the government yard
in Trench Town


986
1:4:55,738 --> 1:5:0,243
Oba observing the hypocrites


987
1:5:0,243 --> 1:5:3,246
- This was owned by Chris Blackwell.


988
1:5:3,246 --> 1:5:4,914
It was called Island House.


989
1:5:4,914 --> 1:5:8,96
And he had several of his friends
and associates who really lived here.


990
1:5:8,96 --> 1:5:11,963
Not like an apartment building,
but people who knew each other.


991
1:5:11,963 --> 1:5:15,383
You know, they're occupied
downstairs and upstairs.


992
1:5:15,383 --> 1:5:19,137
Chris made this available
for Bob to rehearse.


993
1:5:19,137 --> 1:5:21,514
And eventually, over time,


994
1:5:21,514 --> 1:5:23,808
Bob bought it from Chris.


995
1:5:23,808 --> 1:5:26,811
- Well, Rastas weren't allowed uptown,


996
1:5:26,811 --> 1:5:31,482
and, until Bob moved in,
there were no dreadlocks there.


997
1:5:31,482 --> 1:5:33,276
- A woman said to Bob,


998
1:5:33,276 --> 1:5:35,945
"How come you live at 56 Hope Road,


999
1:5:35,945 --> 1:5:40,533
which is two doors up from King's House
where the governor lives,


1000
1:5:40,533 --> 1:5:44,829
and three doors up from Jamaica House
where the prime minister lives?"


1001
1:5:44,829 --> 1:5:54,63
And Bob just said,
"Sister, I bring the ghetto uptown."


1002
1:5:54,63 --> 1:5:59,969
One of the people who live here
prior to Bob was Cindy Breakspeare.


1003
1:5:59,969 --> 1:6:3,556
And she lived there
with her brother Reds.


1004
1:6:3,556 --> 1:6:7,81
- I loved the accommodation because I loved
the old house with the wooden floors,


1005
1:6:7,81 --> 1:6:10,271
and, you know, it was just lovely.


1006
1:6:10,271 --> 1:6:18,279
Cool and breezy, and it was great.


1007
1:6:18,279 --> 1:6:21,73
There's always a stream
of people up and down,


1008
1:6:21,73 --> 1:6:26,621
and shouting and laughter
and just general carrying on.


1009
1:6:26,621 --> 1:6:28,873
You were right in the mix.


1010
1:6:28,873 --> 1:6:32,668
The most important thing culturally that
was happening in Jamaica at that time...


1011
1:6:32,668 --> 1:6:35,463
was happening right there.


1012
1:6:35,463 --> 1:6:38,758
That was the headquarters.
That was the center of it all.


1013
1:6:38,758 --> 1:6:41,552
Bob never left 56 Hope Road.


1014
1:6:41,552 --> 1:6:45,723
People come from
all over the world to see him.


1015
1:6:45,723 --> 1:6:48,559
 Did you live at Hope Road
with your dad?


1016
1:6:48,559 --> 1:6:50,895
No, we lived probably a couple
of miles from Hope Road.


1017
1:6:50,895 --> 1:6:55,107
- Right.
- 'Cause Hope Road was really...


1018
1:6:55,107 --> 1:6:58,778
I don't know. It was a spot.


1019
1:6:58,778 --> 1:7:0,988
 Rasta is an open-door thing.


1020
1:7:0,988 --> 1:7:3,533
Nobody not checking your credentials.


1021
1:7:3,533 --> 1:7:5,785
So all kinds of people
come in to Hope Road.


1022
1:7:5,785 --> 1:7:8,621
Good, bad and indifferent.


1023
1:7:8,621 --> 1:7:11,707
 Every time you go to
56 Hope Road,


1024
1:7:11,707 --> 1:7:14,544
you would see a lot of people
gather with Bob... reasoning,


1025
1:7:14,544 --> 1:7:16,546
talking about politics,


1026
1:7:16,546 --> 1:7:18,214
talking about God,


1027
1:7:18,214 --> 1:7:20,8
talking about history.


1028
1:7:20,8 --> 1:7:23,261
You know, talking about everything.


1029
1:7:23,261 --> 1:7:27,223
- Bob was very strict.
Him run this thing like an army.


1030
1:7:27,223 --> 1:7:29,392
We call him "Skipper."


1031
1:7:29,392 --> 1:7:33,646
You see, the thing is, we had
certain strict rules at that time.


1032
1:7:33,646 --> 1:7:37,4
Woman supposed to wear dress,
not pants.


1033
1:7:37,4 --> 1:7:38,734
So you had those kind...


1034
1:7:38,734 --> 1:7:41,7
Don't come in with
what we call war paint.


1035
1:7:41,7 --> 1:7:45,116
Lipstick and eye shadow.
And this is a roots saying kinda,


1036
1:7:45,116 --> 1:7:46,742
if you wanna come round Rasta,


1037
1:7:46,742 --> 1:7:50,162
then you have to throw away
those Babylonian things.


1038
1:7:50,162 --> 1:7:53,791
 It was a camp
with rules and doctrines...


1039
1:7:53,791 --> 1:7:58,546
and tenets to live by,
and it was serious.


1040
1:7:58,546 --> 1:8:2,174
 Bob was very, like,
health conscious with him foods.


1041
1:8:2,174 --> 1:8:6,762
 The blender would always be
going with excellent juices.


1042
1:8:6,762 --> 1:8:9,515
Irish moss on the fire.
Fish tea going.


1043
1:8:9,515 --> 1:8:17,23
You know, everything
to make you strong.


1044
1:8:17,23 --> 1:8:19,942
- When I met him,
we started a routine.


1045
1:8:19,942 --> 1:8:23,195
My routine was getting up
in the mornings, training,


1046
1:8:23,195 --> 1:8:25,448
do a lot of running,
exercise, go to the beach.


1047
1:8:25,448 --> 1:8:28,2
So it became an integral part
of our lifestyle.


1048
1:8:28,2 --> 1:8:31,954
- The whole Rasta thing
is based on eternal life


1049
1:8:31,954 --> 1:8:33,789
and taking care of your body.


1050
1:8:33,789 --> 1:8:36,125
It's the temple of the Lord.


1051
1:8:36,125 --> 1:8:38,544
And we'd run on the beach
and then up this mountain


1052
1:8:38,544 --> 1:8:41,964
to a place called Cane River Falls.
Incredible waterfalls.


1053
1:8:41,964 --> 1:8:43,716
I shot some video up there.


1054
1:8:43,716 --> 1:8:48,304
'Cause every day we pay the price
with a little sacrifice


1055
1:8:48,304 --> 1:8:52,141
Jammin' till the jam is through


1056
1:8:52,141 --> 1:8:55,227
We're jammin'


1057
1:8:55,227 --> 1:8:58,147
 Cane River,
we went up there, really,


1058
1:8:58,147 --> 1:9:1,817
to get the waterfall
beat on your back.


1059
1:9:1,817 --> 1:9:7,531
It was like the best massage
you can get.


1060
1:9:7,531 --> 1:9:11,41
This spot we're standing on now
was a stadium.


1061
1:9:11,41 --> 1:9:18,167
This was a football field.


1062
1:9:18,167 --> 1:9:20,378
So we had like two goal posts.


1063
1:9:20,378 --> 1:9:22,546
You know, like small scrimmage.


1064
1:9:22,546 --> 1:9:25,91
The most we ever played
was five-a-side scrimmage.


1065
1:9:25,91 --> 1:9:26,55
So you had one there.


1066
1:9:26,55 --> 1:9:28,844
Then we had one down the back here.


1067
1:9:28,844 --> 1:9:30,179
So, I'd say maybe...


1068
1:9:30,179 --> 1:9:33,99
"Wow, that's a small field
when you look at it."


1069
1:9:33,99 --> 1:9:37,978
Probably was what, 40 yards?


1070
1:9:37,978 --> 1:9:42,66
In everything that Bob does,
very competitive.


1071
1:9:42,66 --> 1:9:53,119
So, you know, everything
he really gave it 110%.


1072
1:9:53,119 --> 1:9:54,954
- He had a passion.


1073
1:9:54,954 --> 1:10:0,876
Everything I did with a ball,
he would try to do it.


1074
1:10:0,876 --> 1:10:2,795
 He just didn't play
for the fun of it.


1075
1:10:2,795 --> 1:10:4,964
This was always part
of the process, you know?


1076
1:10:4,964 --> 1:10:7,425
Before he writes a song
he'd burn a spliff.


1077
1:10:7,425 --> 1:10:11,95
Then you go run,
so you can lively up yourself.


1078
1:10:11,95 --> 1:10:18,144
And then you get more inspired
so the lyrics can come out.


1079
1:10:18,144 --> 1:10:21,605
 I play everywhere.


1080
1:10:21,605 --> 1:10:23,607
Anywhere it is possible, you know?


1081
1:10:23,607 --> 1:10:35,703



1082
1:10:35,703 --> 1:10:38,33
 He began to come and visit.


1083
1:10:38,33 --> 1:10:41,333
You just hear these footsteps come
running up the steps in the evening,


1084
1:10:41,333 --> 1:10:45,171
always when the football was over
and place kind of quiet down, you know?


1085
1:10:45,171 --> 1:10:48,9
And there's nobody to really see
the little moves that you're making.


1086
1:10:48,9 --> 1:10:50,259
'Cause in the day the place
is teeming with people,


1087
1:10:50,259 --> 1:10:56,182
so you can't be too overt
because you'd be outed instantly.


1088
1:10:56,182 --> 1:10:58,225



1089
1:10:58,225 --> 1:11:15,367



1090
1:11:15,367 --> 1:11:19,538



1091
1:11:19,538 --> 1:11:22,917
I went downtown
I went downtown


1092
1:11:22,917 --> 1:11:26,17
I saw Miss Brown
Said I saw Miss Brown


1093
1:11:26,17 --> 1:11:29,673
She had brown sugar
Had brown sugar


1094
1:11:29,673 --> 1:11:33,135
All over her booga-wooga
Over her booga-wooga


1095
1:11:33,135 --> 1:11:36,597
Think I might join the fun
Think I might join the fun


1096
1:11:36,597 --> 1:11:39,642
But I had to hit and run
But I had to hit and run


1097
1:11:39,642 --> 1:11:43,2
See I just can't settle down


1098
1:11:43,2 --> 1:11:45,689
In a kinky part of town


1099
1:11:45,689 --> 1:11:47,24
Ride on


1100
1:11:47,24 --> 1:11:48,484
 When did you first meet Bob?


1101
1:11:48,484 --> 1:11:49,944
- I see Bob every day.


1102
1:11:49,944 --> 1:11:52,78
Bob live on Second Street.
I live on First Street.


1103
1:11:52,78 --> 1:11:55,825
Ride on
See I just won't settle down


1104
1:11:55,825 --> 1:11:57,701
Ride on
Everybody


1105
1:11:57,701 --> 1:12:0,329
I would take no notice of him...


1106
1:12:0,329 --> 1:12:4,83
because he would bother me,
and I would go and tell my mother.


1107
1:12:4,83 --> 1:12:6,585
 How old were you?
- Sixteen.


1108
1:12:6,585 --> 1:12:8,587
Take me away


1109
1:12:8,587 --> 1:12:10,881
Kinky reggae now


1110
1:12:10,881 --> 1:12:13,5
 What did he do
when he paid you attention?


1111
1:12:13,5 --> 1:12:17,263
 Like stuff like,
"Don't give it away. I'm growing you."


1112
1:12:17,263 --> 1:12:18,722
"Remember, don't have
any boyfriend before me."


1113
1:12:18,722 --> 1:12:21,308
Stuff like that.


1114
1:12:21,308 --> 1:12:27,147
 Was he charming?
- Oh, yes.


1115
1:12:27,147 --> 1:12:30,317



1116
1:12:30,317 --> 1:12:32,236
- Why were so many girls attracted to him?


1117
1:12:32,236 --> 1:12:35,322
- Oh, my God.


1118
1:12:35,322 --> 1:12:38,284
You don't know Bob.


1119
1:12:38,284 --> 1:12:39,702
That's a handsome guy.


1120
1:12:39,702 --> 1:12:43,747
I went down to Piccadilly Circus


1121
1:12:43,747 --> 1:12:48,168
- People have visions of women
beating down the door to get at Bob Marley.


1122
1:12:48,168 --> 1:12:51,88
- Je... 
- Grabbing clothes.


1123
1:12:51,88 --> 1:12:54,133
- Is it like that?
- No.


1124
1:12:54,133 --> 1:12:57,136
 Why was he so successful
with women?


1125
1:12:57,136 --> 1:13:0,431
- Because he was shy.


1126
1:13:0,431 --> 1:13:2,766
Bob is not the womanizer...


1127
1:13:2,766 --> 1:13:5,978
that people make him out to be.


1128
1:13:5,978 --> 1:13:8,397
I think more, the women came at him.


1129
1:13:8,397 --> 1:13:11,108
That why they say
Nice one


1130
1:13:11,108 --> 1:13:13,11
Was he faithful?
 To whom? God?


1131
1:13:13,11 --> 1:13:15,613
To Jah? Yes, he was faithful to Jah.


1132
1:13:15,613 --> 1:13:18,741
Faithful to any one woman?
No.


1133
1:13:18,741 --> 1:13:22,578
Why? Somebody own him?


1134
1:13:22,578 --> 1:13:25,331
What is fidelity?
Western ideology, you know.


1135
1:13:25,331 --> 1:13:27,625
A ring on your finger,
a ring through your nose?


1136
1:13:27,625 --> 1:13:30,377
That's for Western men, man.


1137
1:13:30,377 --> 1:13:32,296
They can only handle
one woman at a time.


1138
1:13:32,296 --> 1:13:38,427
Bob could handle more.


1139
1:13:38,427 --> 1:13:41,764
 One day a lady
came to me and she said,


1140
1:13:41,764 --> 1:13:44,58
"Didn't anyone tell you
that Bob was married?"


1141
1:13:44,58 --> 1:13:46,268
And I didn't know.


1142
1:13:46,268 --> 1:13:49,813
- For a time there I never knew
that he was legally married.


1143
1:13:49,813 --> 1:13:53,108
I did come to know.
Eventually, his mom told me.


1144
1:13:53,108 --> 1:13:55,277
 Did he see Rita
at all at that time?


1145
1:13:55,277 --> 1:13:57,738
- Sure. I mean,
they worked together, you know.


1146
1:13:57,738 --> 1:14:0,699
Toured the world together.


1147
1:14:0,699 --> 1:14:4,161
- When we were on tour,
Rita had her own room.


1148
1:14:4,161 --> 1:14:7,206
She was not with Bob.


1149
1:14:7,206 --> 1:14:8,958
She would see everything that goes on.


1150
1:14:8,958 --> 1:14:16,131
But she had maximum respect
for the work.


1151
1:14:16,131 --> 1:14:17,967
- How did you cope
through all the years


1152
1:14:17,967 --> 1:14:19,593
that you were married together,


1153
1:14:19,593 --> 1:14:22,805
and Bob was having these relationships
with other women?


1154
1:14:22,805 --> 1:14:25,933
- I became his... his guardian angel.


1155
1:14:25,933 --> 1:14:28,143
And then by that time,


1156
1:14:28,143 --> 1:14:32,22
I was past the surface
of being just a wife.


1157
1:14:32,22 --> 1:14:37,403
Because of the importance
of who I knew Bob is.


1158
1:14:37,403 --> 1:14:40,72
I didn't see it as a fun trip.
We were on a mission.


1159
1:14:40,72 --> 1:14:43,534
It was like an evangelist campaign...


1160
1:14:43,534 --> 1:14:47,663
to bring people closer to Jah.


1161
1:14:47,663 --> 1:14:51,125
 They had this...
this bond, you know?


1162
1:14:51,125 --> 1:14:54,837
I wouldn't...
I mean, you know,


1163
1:14:54,837 --> 1:14:59,49
if that was my husband,
I wouldn't.


1164
1:14:59,49 --> 1:15:3,387
 We never fought about women.
We would never get into that.


1165
1:15:3,387 --> 1:15:5,222
He would come and say to me,


1166
1:15:5,222 --> 1:15:8,809
"Rita, I did this,"
or "This is what happened."


1167
1:15:8,809 --> 1:15:12,438
I was the one that he would call
to get women out of his dressing room...


1168
1:15:12,438 --> 1:15:14,273
when it get to that stage.


1169
1:15:14,273 --> 1:15:17,86
"Come up for my room.
Come and get these people out for me."


1170
1:15:17,86 --> 1:15:20,29
And I would do that gracefully.


1171
1:15:20,29 --> 1:15:21,905
"Come on, ladies. It's bedtime.


1172
1:15:21,905 --> 1:15:24,533
We have a show tomorrow, so..."


1173
1:15:24,533 --> 1:15:27,536
- She wouldn't get upset, you know,


1174
1:15:27,536 --> 1:15:30,33
but...


1175
1:15:30,33 --> 1:15:32,624
there were times when, you know,


1176
1:15:32,624 --> 1:15:35,252
you knew she was hurting.


1177
1:15:35,252 --> 1:15:38,172
Hurt all of us.


1178
1:15:38,172 --> 1:15:40,758
And that's what he didn't like.


1179
1:15:40,758 --> 1:15:43,761
He didn't like it when, like,
we knew that she was hurt,


1180
1:15:43,761 --> 1:15:46,18
and it showed on us.


1181
1:15:46,18 --> 1:15:48,223
That's when, "Okay,
we're going for ice cream.


1182
1:15:48,223 --> 1:15:50,976
We're going for burgers.
What do you want?"


1183
1:15:50,976 --> 1:15:53,562
 Do you think
that he was being selfish?


1184
1:15:53,562 --> 1:15:57,9
- Yes. It's not fair to no woman.


1185
1:15:57,9 --> 1:15:59,818
That is not fair at all,


1186
1:15:59,818 --> 1:16:3,363
but we still couldn't hate him for it.


1187
1:16:3,363 --> 1:16:8,452



1188
1:16:8,452 --> 1:16:20,714



1189
1:16:20,714 --> 1:16:24,468
 In the capital of Kingston
there are rival shantytown ghettos...


1190
1:16:24,468 --> 1:16:28,138
where whole communities
are divided along sectarian lines.


1191
1:16:28,138 --> 1:16:29,723
These zones are controlled


1192
1:16:29,723 --> 1:16:32,476
by the prime minister's
People's National Party,


1193
1:16:32,476 --> 1:16:34,895
who are accused
of being communists,


1194
1:16:34,895 --> 1:16:36,98
or by the opposition
Jamaica Labour Party,


1195
1:16:36,98 --> 1:16:40,317
who are accused of being fascists.


1196
1:16:40,317 --> 1:16:43,195
- Politics in Jamaica at that time...


1197
1:16:43,195 --> 1:16:47,991
was like an East-West confrontation,
which was scary.


1198
1:16:47,991 --> 1:16:53,122
You have one side which is kind
of more ultra-conservative, right wing,


1199
1:16:53,122 --> 1:16:55,82
which is Seaga,


1200
1:16:55,82 --> 1:16:57,668
who was like Reagan's man
in the Caribbean.


1201
1:16:57,668 --> 1:17:1,13
And then Manley
was trying to work a system...


1202
1:17:1,13 --> 1:17:4,49
called democratic socialism,


1203
1:17:4,49 --> 1:17:5,843
which other parties say,


1204
1:17:5,843 --> 1:17:9,12
"That's just a disguise for
saying you are a communist."


1205
1:17:9,12 --> 1:17:12,182
 Sometimes it's only insults
or stones and bottles...


1206
1:17:12,182 --> 1:17:13,851
thrown from one side to the other.


1207
1:17:13,851 --> 1:17:16,103
But often it's bombs and bullets,


1208
1:17:16,103 --> 1:17:19,231
and almost every day the newspapers
carry fresh reports...


1209
1:17:19,231 --> 1:17:21,9
of the previous day's killings in Kingston.


1210
1:17:21,9 --> 1:17:25,988
 The whole thing became
like a gangster thing.


1211
1:17:25,988 --> 1:17:28,31
Political gangster.


1212
1:17:28,31 --> 1:17:30,868
- These were the guys
who kept things in line


1213
1:17:30,868 --> 1:17:33,162
for the M.P.s, you know.


1214
1:17:33,162 --> 1:17:39,1
So you find that in some areas,
the real power is enforcers.


1215
1:17:39,1 --> 1:17:41,837
- You like this girl...
that's both of us.


1216
1:17:41,837 --> 1:17:44,506
You like her, and I like her.
We start to fight over her.


1217
1:17:44,506 --> 1:17:49,261
It's like that.
He like P.N.P. You like J.L.P.


1218
1:17:49,261 --> 1:17:52,514
You wanna fight for your P.N.P.


1219
1:17:52,514 --> 1:17:55,142
- Bob was friends
with all of those guys.


1220
1:17:55,142 --> 1:17:59,188
All of the bad guys from
the Labour Party was Bob friend.


1221
1:17:59,188 --> 1:18:3,275
Likewise, all the bad guys
from the P.N.P.


1222
1:18:3,275 --> 1:18:5,11
 These are guys
that come from...


1223
1:18:5,11 --> 1:18:7,487
the same neighborhood
he grew up with.


1224
1:18:7,487 --> 1:18:10,199
These are really bad guys.


1225
1:18:10,199 --> 1:18:12,34
'Cause you might see some guys, yeah,


1226
1:18:12,34 --> 1:18:16,121
and then tomorrow you'd take up
the Jamaican paper,


1227
1:18:16,121 --> 1:18:17,873
you'd see the 10-most-wanted list...


1228
1:18:17,873 --> 1:18:20,626
four of the guys that were on it
are already dead.


1229
1:18:20,626 --> 1:18:23,545
There are now five.


1230
1:18:23,545 --> 1:18:26,6
Some of them actually
love the music, you know,


1231
1:18:26,6 --> 1:18:28,759
but their main thing is, you know...


1232
1:18:28,759 --> 1:18:32,387
warfare and badness, you know.


1233
1:18:32,387 --> 1:18:48,237



1234
1:18:48,237 --> 1:18:54,243
- Bob did a concert
with Stevie Wonder in Jamaica,


1235
1:18:54,243 --> 1:18:58,372
and they actually performed
two songs together.


1236
1:18:58,372 --> 1:19:1,25
I think very "Superstitious,"
which Bob knew,


1237
1:19:1,25 --> 1:19:5,128
and "I Shot the Sheriff."


1238
1:19:5,128 --> 1:19:9,258
I shot the sheriff


1239
1:19:9,258 --> 1:19:15,305
But I did not shoot the deputy


1240
1:19:15,305 --> 1:19:18,141
 Stevie made a gesture
by giving, I think,


1241
1:19:18,141 --> 1:19:20,31
half of his pay for the show...


1242
1:19:20,31 --> 1:19:23,647
to the Salvation Army
blind school in Jamaica,


1243
1:19:23,647 --> 1:19:27,15
and I think Bob
was moved by that.


1244
1:19:27,15 --> 1:19:31,53
And Bob said,
"Well, we'll give a free concert."


1245
1:19:31,53 --> 1:19:34,199
They took that idea


1246
1:19:34,199 --> 1:19:35,534
to Michael Manley,


1247
1:19:35,534 --> 1:19:38,578
who was just down the road...
the prime minister...


1248
1:19:38,578 --> 1:19:41,373
and they were, like,
enthused about it.


1249
1:19:41,373 --> 1:19:45,585
 Bob Marley, the world's
leading exponent of reggae music,


1250
1:19:45,585 --> 1:19:49,381
has agreed to appear in a major
free concert to be held for the benefit...


1251
1:19:49,381 --> 1:19:52,217
of the Jamaican people in Kingston
on Sunday, December 5.


1252
1:19:52,217 --> 1:19:55,887
The announcement was made at
a press conference held at Jamaica House...


1253
1:19:55,887 --> 1:19:58,14
by Marley, his manager Don Taylor...


1254
1:19:58,14 --> 1:20:0,475
and the parliamentary secretary
in charge of cultural information,


1255
1:20:0,475 --> 1:20:2,311
Arnold Bertram.


1256
1:20:2,311 --> 1:20:4,396
 Well, I think
he got tricked into it,


1257
1:20:4,396 --> 1:20:7,274
'cause he rang me and asked me
if I thought he should do the concert.


1258
1:20:7,274 --> 1:20:12,29
I said, "Well, if it's the prime minister,
then you're doing it for the country.


1259
1:20:12,29 --> 1:20:14,114
But if there's going to be
an election soon,


1260
1:20:14,114 --> 1:20:17,826
then you're doing it for him
rather than the country."


1261
1:20:17,826 --> 1:20:21,163
 Two weeks following
that announcement on November 22,


1262
1:20:21,163 --> 1:20:23,206
Jamaica's prime minister,
Michael Manley,


1263
1:20:23,206 --> 1:20:26,71
called new general elections
for December 15.


1264
1:20:26,71 --> 1:20:30,922
- If we knew that election was going
to happen in that space of time,


1265
1:20:30,922 --> 1:20:33,925
we'd have never done that concert.


1266
1:20:33,925 --> 1:20:39,598



1267
1:20:39,598 --> 1:20:41,558
 So with the upcoming election,


1268
1:20:41,558 --> 1:20:44,978
you don't really want to think about
or care who wins?


1269
1:20:44,978 --> 1:20:49,858



1270
1:20:49,858 --> 1:20:52,819
- Remember, Bob is becoming
very popular,


1271
1:20:52,819 --> 1:20:55,238
and whoever side Bob seems to be on,


1272
1:20:55,238 --> 1:20:57,449
that's the side people gonna be on.


1273
1:20:57,449 --> 1:20:59,368
- Hell, Bob had a lot of control


1274
1:20:59,368 --> 1:21:1,328
down there in Jamaica, man,
you know?


1275
1:21:1,328 --> 1:21:3,622
And them politicians didn't like that.


1276
1:21:3,622 --> 1:21:8,46
- Bob, I think, had overexposed
himself on the political side,


1277
1:21:8,46 --> 1:21:12,47
and that was bound to draw
the anger of some others...


1278
1:21:12,47 --> 1:21:13,715
because he had friends
on both sides.


1279
1:21:13,715 --> 1:21:16,927
- The thing was, like,
you have to be on one side.


1280
1:21:16,927 --> 1:21:18,845
You have to be on some side.


1281
1:21:18,845 --> 1:21:26,52
You can't be in the middle,
or you can get hurt.


1282
1:21:26,52 --> 1:21:29,231
 We'd feel a little kind
of tension,


1283
1:21:29,231 --> 1:21:33,11
but, you know,
the politics kind of getting hot.


1284
1:21:33,11 --> 1:21:36,113
 There were people saying
that they heard...


1285
1:21:36,113 --> 1:21:39,74
that they were gonna
shoot up the concert.


1286
1:21:39,74 --> 1:21:44,663
 People in the group, you know,
the musicians and The I-Threes...


1287
1:21:44,663 --> 1:21:49,209
every day, as it would get closer
to this day of the concert...


1288
1:21:49,209 --> 1:21:52,587
...people was feeling hesitant
about doing it.


1289
1:21:52,587 --> 1:21:58,468
They had a fear for it.


1290
1:21:58,468 --> 1:22:1,596
 Every night there would be
rehearsal at 56 Hope Road...


1291
1:22:1,596 --> 1:22:5,725
for the concert.


1292
1:22:5,725 --> 1:22:8,27
 We usually had two guys...


1293
1:22:8,27 --> 1:22:10,772
from equivalent to the Secret Service.


1294
1:22:10,772 --> 1:22:12,649
They call them the Protective Service.


1295
1:22:12,649 --> 1:22:15,986
They, like, protect the prime minister
and stuff.


1296
1:22:15,986 --> 1:22:21,32
And they used to come every night,
but they never came that night.


1297
1:22:21,32 --> 1:22:25,78
- We had took a break, so everybody
was kind of floating around.


1298
1:22:25,78 --> 1:22:29,124
Don Taylor, Bob and myself...


1299
1:22:29,124 --> 1:22:32,836
was in the kitchen.


1300
1:22:32,836 --> 1:22:36,214
- I was in the car, you know,
getting ready to come out.


1301
1:22:36,214 --> 1:22:39,176
I see some men going up the steps.


1302
1:22:39,176 --> 1:22:44,97
- The gunman approached
from the side here...


1303
1:22:44,97 --> 1:22:47,517
and kind of pushed his gun
through here.


1304
1:22:47,517 --> 1:22:50,896
- Well, you see a black glove
with a gun in it pointing up,


1305
1:22:50,896 --> 1:22:54,24
you know... there was nowhere else
to go in the kitchen...


1306
1:22:54,24 --> 1:22:57,944
'cause we just, like, at the wall.


1307
1:22:57,944 --> 1:23:2,115
- And then I heard the gunshots.


1308
1:23:2,115 --> 1:23:8,79



1309
1:23:8,79 --> 1:23:11,833
- Then they turned the gun on the car.


1310
1:23:11,833 --> 1:23:14,711
I felt the warmest of blood running down,


1311
1:23:14,711 --> 1:23:17,47
and then I realized I was shot.


1312
1:23:17,47 --> 1:23:20,926
- The cat just kept on shooting, man,
till he ran out of bullets.


1313
1:23:20,926 --> 1:23:22,677
- The one hold a gun to my head,


1314
1:23:22,677 --> 1:23:24,93
and one said to the other one,
"Everybody dead?"


1315
1:23:24,93 --> 1:23:27,641
And the other said, "Yeah, man,
everybody dead. Everybody dead."


1316
1:23:27,641 --> 1:23:30,185
- Next thing I see
Don Taylor come out, man,


1317
1:23:30,185 --> 1:23:33,396
and, like, blood pouring out of him
like ketchup, man.


1318
1:23:33,396 --> 1:23:35,649
And then he finally collapsed
right there on the floor.


1319
1:23:35,649 --> 1:23:37,359
I'm, like, "Man!"


1320
1:23:37,359 --> 1:23:40,153
- And I'm shouting out for Bob,
and then I heard a voice...


1321
1:23:40,153 --> 1:23:43,448
who I recognized as Carly Barrett...
coming from.


1322
1:23:43,448 --> 1:23:46,159
He said, "Bob is all right.


1323
1:23:46,159 --> 1:23:49,996
Bob is all right."


1324
1:23:49,996 --> 1:23:52,29
He had a burn right...


1325
1:23:52,29 --> 1:23:55,43
the bullet traveled right here...


1326
1:23:55,43 --> 1:23:59,5
and actually lodged in his arm.


1327
1:23:59,5 --> 1:24:3,134
- It's just a miracle, man,
that nobody died from that, man.


1328
1:24:3,134 --> 1:24:5,595
 So, it wasn't really
a professional hit?


1329
1:24:5,595 --> 1:24:7,973
- Well, as professional as Jamaica is.


1330
1:24:7,973 --> 1:24:10,475
They watch a lot of movies.


1331
1:24:10,475 --> 1:24:13,186



1332
1:24:13,186 --> 1:24:15,897
 Here now is
a special item of news.


1333
1:24:15,897 --> 1:24:18,9
Entertainer and reggae star,
Bob Marley,


1334
1:24:18,9 --> 1:24:22,7
Rita Marley and the manager
of The Wailers, Don Taylor,


1335
1:24:22,7 --> 1:24:24,239
are now patients
in the University Hospital


1336
1:24:24,239 --> 1:24:26,157
after receiving gunshot wounds...


1337
1:24:26,157 --> 1:24:35,83
during a shooting incident tonight.


1338
1:24:35,83 --> 1:24:49,18



1339
1:24:49,18 --> 1:24:51,308
- That's one thing for sure...


1340
1:24:51,308 --> 1:24:54,603
that they was trying to stop
that concert from happening.


1341
1:24:54,603 --> 1:24:57,522
- The whole thing about whether
the concert was gonna happen or not,


1342
1:24:57,522 --> 1:25:0,65
there was so much pressure,
there was pressure from everywhere.


1343
1:25:0,65 --> 1:25:7,282
- I was just scared Bob
would get assassinated.


1344
1:25:7,282 --> 1:25:9,159
 In the twilight
inside the arena,


1345
1:25:9,159 --> 1:25:11,119
the crowd is fenced off...


1346
1:25:11,119 --> 1:25:14,539
and armed police are positioned
all around the park.


1347
1:25:14,539 --> 1:25:16,541
Five hours after the concert
was due to begin,


1348
1:25:16,541 --> 1:25:20,754
the star, Bob Marley,
is still not there.


1349
1:25:20,754 --> 1:25:23,548
 Some were trying to say,
"Bob, don't go.


1350
1:25:23,548 --> 1:25:26,801
They didn't get you.
They may try for you again."


1351
1:25:26,801 --> 1:25:30,138
- Everyone saying,
"You really wanna do it, boss?"


1352
1:25:30,138 --> 1:25:32,265
And he was saying... he said, "Yes."


1353
1:25:32,265 --> 1:25:34,351
- I said, "Hey, you know,
I'm with you, man.


1354
1:25:34,351 --> 1:25:36,561
If you wanna do it, let's do it."


1355
1:25:36,561 --> 1:25:39,356
 The police came for him
and took him down,


1356
1:25:39,356 --> 1:25:42,651
and we were in the car
right behind the police vehicle.


1357
1:25:42,651 --> 1:25:48,281



1358
1:25:48,281 --> 1:25:53,662
- When I got there, I couldn't
believe the situation, man.


1359
1:25:53,662 --> 1:25:56,39
This is at night in Kingston.


1360
1:25:56,39 --> 1:25:59,501
You got, like, 80,000 people, man.
You know what I mean?


1361
1:25:59,501 --> 1:26:3,797
If somebody wanted to try to get you,
here's, like, a perfect situation.


1362
1:26:3,797 --> 1:26:11,846



1363
1:26:11,846 --> 1:26:14,891
But it was a special night, man.
It was a special moment, man.


1364
1:26:14,891 --> 1:26:20,105
 Come on, people!
We got a band to see play tonight.


1365
1:26:20,105 --> 1:26:22,44
Come on!


1366
1:26:22,44 --> 1:26:25,902



1367
1:26:25,902 --> 1:26:31,95
- Whoo!


1368
1:26:31,95 --> 1:26:34,369
 Yeah.


1369
1:26:34,369 --> 1:26:36,413



1370
1:26:36,413 --> 1:26:38,373
 Bob was not afraid.


1371
1:26:38,373 --> 1:26:43,753
Bob knew that if anything happens
while he's doing his work,


1372
1:26:43,753 --> 1:26:47,48
he know that the almighty God
is protect him.


1373
1:26:47,48 --> 1:26:49,8
Oh children


1374
1:26:49,8 --> 1:26:52,762
In Jamaica


1375
1:26:52,762 --> 1:26:56,599
In Jamaica yow


1376
1:26:56,599 --> 1:27:0,228
- If you lacked faith before then,


1377
1:27:0,228 --> 1:27:3,189
you could not deny it after that, man.


1378
1:27:3,189 --> 1:27:5,442
Almighty


1379
1:27:5,442 --> 1:27:7,402
Almighty


1380
1:27:7,402 --> 1:27:11,114
Oh, Lord, help us
Tonight


1381
1:27:11,114 --> 1:27:14,826
Cast away evil
The evil spell


1382
1:27:14,826 --> 1:27:17,62
Throw some water in the well


1383
1:27:17,62 --> 1:27:23,84
And smile in Jamaica


1384
1:27:23,84 --> 1:27:26,88
In Jamaica, yow


1385
1:27:26,88 --> 1:27:30,467
In Jamaica


1386
1:27:30,467 --> 1:27:49,527
In Jamaica yow


1387
1:27:49,527 --> 1:27:53,281
In Jamaica


1388
1:27:53,281 --> 1:27:57,76
In Jamaica yow


1389
1:27:57,76 --> 1:28:1,8
In Jamaica


1390
1:28:1,8 --> 1:28:19,182
In Jamaica yow


1391
1:28:19,182 --> 1:28:22,852



1392
1:28:22,852 --> 1:28:36,449



1393
1:28:36,449 --> 1:28:42,372



1394
1:28:42,372 --> 1:28:44,29



1395
1:28:44,29 --> 1:28:45,667



1396
1:28:45,667 --> 1:28:51,714



1397
1:28:51,714 --> 1:28:56,177
- After the shooting, he was...
I wouldn't say scared, but just hurt.


1398
1:28:56,177 --> 1:28:58,93
Too hurt to face Jamaica.


1399
1:28:58,93 --> 1:29:2,934
- I was the one who escaped with him
out of Jamaica after the shooting.


1400
1:29:2,934 --> 1:29:4,602
Yeah... me and him.


1401
1:29:4,602 --> 1:29:9,23
He didn't say a word
the whole way through.


1402
1:29:9,23 --> 1:29:13,278
 We went to Nassau first,
and then he went on to London.


1403
1:29:13,278 --> 1:29:16,155
Don't worry


1404
1:29:16,155 --> 1:29:20,285
About a thing


1405
1:29:20,285 --> 1:29:22,537
'Cause every little thing


1406
1:29:22,537 --> 1:29:26,541
Gonna be all right


1407
1:29:26,541 --> 1:29:29,627
Singing don't worry


1408
1:29:29,627 --> 1:29:33,506
About a thing


1409
1:29:33,506 --> 1:29:35,592
'Cause every little thing


1410
1:29:35,592 --> 1:29:37,969
Gonna be all right


1411
1:29:37,969 --> 1:29:41,14
 I think he just wanted
to take a break.


1412
1:29:41,14 --> 1:29:43,141
He wanted to not be
looking over his shoulder.


1413
1:29:43,141 --> 1:29:44,893
He wanted not to be dealing
with the problem,


1414
1:29:44,893 --> 1:29:47,729
not dealing with the controversy.


1415
1:29:47,729 --> 1:29:50,189
He just wanted some
free head space to work,


1416
1:29:50,189 --> 1:29:52,15
to make music, to tour.


1417
1:29:52,15 --> 1:29:55,69
Singing sweet songs


1418
1:29:55,69 --> 1:29:58,72
- We moved immediately
into Chelsea area.


1419
1:29:58,72 --> 1:29:59,407
Oakley Street.


1420
1:29:59,407 --> 1:30:3,161
It was a great experience because


1421
1:30:3,161 --> 1:30:4,829
we're all together...


1422
1:30:4,829 --> 1:30:6,915
in this house.


1423
1:30:6,915 --> 1:30:9,417
- Well, on each floor
there was a different musician.


1424
1:30:9,417 --> 1:30:11,753
There was, uh, Tyrone Downie
on one floor,


1425
1:30:11,753 --> 1:30:13,588
Carlton Barrett on another floor,


1426
1:30:13,588 --> 1:30:15,798
"Family Man" Barrett on another floor,


1427
1:30:15,798 --> 1:30:18,301
Alvin "Seeco" Patterson on another floor.


1428
1:30:18,301 --> 1:30:22,18
Neville Garrick, I think,
was in the basement sharing with somebody.


1429
1:30:22,18 --> 1:30:25,975
- We were a stone's throw
from Battersea Park Bridge.


1430
1:30:25,975 --> 1:30:30,188
Once we went over the bridge,
then you had a football field.


1431
1:30:30,188 --> 1:30:33,399
We even played against
some National Front guys.


1432
1:30:33,399 --> 1:30:36,402
We whupped them a couple of times.


1433
1:30:36,402 --> 1:30:38,71



1434
1:30:38,71 --> 1:30:39,656
 Did he feel like
he was in exile?


1435
1:30:39,656 --> 1:30:41,115
- Yeah, man.


1436
1:30:41,115 --> 1:30:45,578
But Bob was, like, deeply
into creation of music.


1437
1:30:45,578 --> 1:30:50,41
That's how I think
he satisfied his soul.


1438
1:30:50,41 --> 1:30:53,92
 Bob's life was spared,
and he was very happy to be alive.


1439
1:30:53,92 --> 1:30:57,256
See, Jah gave him another chance.


1440
1:30:57,256 --> 1:31:0,718
 He was also confronted
by his mortality.


1441
1:31:0,718 --> 1:31:5,39
And when you think that these might be
your last opportunities to do anything,


1442
1:31:5,39 --> 1:31:9,394
you place a greater value
on every moment,


1443
1:31:9,394 --> 1:31:11,604
every second of every moment
of every day.


1444
1:31:11,604 --> 1:31:16,192
There is no time.
We've got no time to lose.


1445
1:31:16,192 --> 1:31:19,32
 He slept basically
about four hours a day.


1446
1:31:19,32 --> 1:31:21,406
And he was always writing a song.


1447
1:31:21,406 --> 1:31:24,2
You know, you'd be up all night writing,
and then he'd go...


1448
1:31:24,2 --> 1:31:26,16
I'd say, "Oh, Bob.
I've gotta go get some sleep now."


1449
1:31:26,16 --> 1:31:27,787
He'd go, "Just half an hour more."


1450
1:31:27,787 --> 1:31:29,872
Half an hour would turn into
four hours, you know.


1451
1:31:29,872 --> 1:31:31,624



1452
1:31:31,624 --> 1:31:35,253
 Bob liked to write
early in the morning.


1453
1:31:35,253 --> 1:31:38,339
Come the morning,
him have this gravelly voice, you know,


1454
1:31:38,339 --> 1:31:40,842
like kind of Rod Stewart-ish
kind of thing.


1455
1:31:40,842 --> 1:31:49,767



1456
1:31:49,767 --> 1:31:52,437
 He would be working out
the melody, working out the melody,


1457
1:31:52,437 --> 1:31:56,65
and then the lyrics
would come after.


1458
1:31:56,65 --> 1:32:0,236
Would that leave you there


1459
1:32:0,236 --> 1:32:3,865
There's something I have to play


1460
1:32:3,865 --> 1:32:8,244
It's that way every day


1461
1:32:8,244 --> 1:32:11,289
Children mark my word


1462
1:32:11,289 --> 1:32:17,336
It's what the Bible say


1463
1:32:17,336 --> 1:32:22,842



1464
1:32:22,842 --> 1:32:26,429
And Miss World 1976...


1465
1:32:26,429 --> 1:32:28,347
is Miss Jamaica!


1466
1:32:28,347 --> 1:32:29,64



1467
1:32:29,64 --> 1:32:33,352
 And the Royal Albert Hall
is in uproar.


1468
1:32:33,352 --> 1:32:35,48
Incredible! Cindy Breakspeare.


1469
1:32:35,48 --> 1:32:38,274
The 21 -year-old health club operator
gets the sash.


1470
1:32:38,274 --> 1:32:40,443
I think she's as overwhelmed as anyone.


1471
1:32:40,443 --> 1:32:42,195
- At the time I won Miss World,


1472
1:32:42,195 --> 1:32:44,53
Bob was not yet
a household name in England.


1473
1:32:44,53 --> 1:32:46,657
But because he was now tied to me,


1474
1:32:46,657 --> 1:32:50,286
and Miss World was
definitely a household name,


1475
1:32:50,286 --> 1:32:53,748
we kind of... we complemented
each other very nicely.


1476
1:32:53,748 --> 1:32:56,584
 Cindy completely overwhelmed
by the emotion of the moment.


1477
1:32:56,584 --> 1:33:3,257
And Wilnelia Merced
crowns the new Miss World 1976.


1478
1:33:3,257 --> 1:33:7,386
 It was considered quite...


1479
1:33:7,386 --> 1:33:9,514
 Outrageous?
- Yeah, that's a good word.


1480
1:33:9,514 --> 1:33:11,432
"Outrageous" works.


1481
1:33:11,432 --> 1:33:15,895
But Bob loved the achievement, you know?
He loved the achievement.


1482
1:33:15,895 --> 1:33:19,774
I don't think there's a man alive
who doesn't want to get "the girl."


1483
1:33:19,774 --> 1:33:21,317
And so...


1484
1:33:21,317 --> 1:33:26,948



1485
1:33:26,948 --> 1:33:30,576
 Would he have liked it
if you had become a Rasta?


1486
1:33:30,576 --> 1:33:33,913
Um, yes, I think
he would have liked it.


1487
1:33:33,913 --> 1:33:37,41
Things would always come up.


1488
1:33:37,41 --> 1:33:39,43
Uh, how you present yourself
as a woman.


1489
1:33:39,43 --> 1:33:41,963
What's appropriate wear,
cover your hair, this, that.


1490
1:33:41,963 --> 1:33:46,259
Here I am on the train coming in
from all parts out of London,


1491
1:33:46,259 --> 1:33:49,11
and, you know, they've got
this tiny little triangular sink


1492
1:33:49,11 --> 1:33:54,58
in the bathroom on the train,
and I'm washing all the make-up off.


1493
1:33:54,58 --> 1:33:57,19
Anyway, one night
I wasn't able to do that,


1494
1:33:57,19 --> 1:33:59,188
and I came home in full regalia...


1495
1:33:59,188 --> 1:34:2,859
red nails, fur coat, fully made up.


1496
1:34:2,859 --> 1:34:5,987
And no sooner than I walked
through the front door and closed it,


1497
1:34:5,987 --> 1:34:8,156
he walked in behind.


1498
1:34:8,156 --> 1:34:21,43
I turned around, he looked at me and said,
"Ah, I catch you."


1499
1:34:21,43 --> 1:34:24,63
I wanna love you


1500
1:34:24,63 --> 1:34:26,841
And treat you right


1501
1:34:26,841 --> 1:34:31,262
I wanna love you


1502
1:34:31,262 --> 1:34:34,307
Every day and every night


1503
1:34:34,307 --> 1:34:39,61
We'll be together


1504
1:34:39,61 --> 1:34:42,231
With a roof right over our heads


1505
1:34:42,231 --> 1:34:47,612
We'll share the shelter


1506
1:34:47,612 --> 1:34:50,364
Of my single bed


1507
1:34:50,364 --> 1:34:55,786
We'll share the same room
Yeah


1508
1:34:55,786 --> 1:34:59,4
For Jah provide the bread


1509
1:34:59,4 --> 1:35:2,84
Is this love is this love is this love


1510
1:35:2,84 --> 1:35:7,89
Is this love that I'm feelin'


1511
1:35:7,89 --> 1:35:10,218
Is this love is this love is this love


1512
1:35:10,218 --> 1:35:16,807
Is this love that I'm feelin'


1513
1:35:16,807 --> 1:35:18,684
 Exodus was huge.


1514
1:35:18,684 --> 1:35:20,811
That was our biggest album
ever there.


1515
1:35:20,811 --> 1:35:24,148
Just mash up Europe,
and it's tearing down America.


1516
1:35:24,148 --> 1:35:25,816
They're waiting for us.


1517
1:35:25,816 --> 1:35:28,194
- And then the American tour
was canceled...


1518
1:35:28,194 --> 1:35:31,447
because Bob was having
problems with his toe.


1519
1:35:31,447 --> 1:35:36,16
- Somebody stepped on it
with their spike boots.


1520
1:35:36,16 --> 1:35:39,205
And then it started to get infected...


1521
1:35:39,205 --> 1:35:42,25
because Bob would still play football
the next day on it...


1522
1:35:42,25 --> 1:35:43,793
and the next day.


1523
1:35:43,793 --> 1:35:47,171
- And that went on for some time...


1524
1:35:47,171 --> 1:35:50,91
before they realized what it really was.


1525
1:35:50,91 --> 1:35:56,597
- They came up with a definitive
diagnosis of melanoma.


1526
1:35:56,597 --> 1:35:59,517
- And they tested
and they found out that...


1527
1:35:59,517 --> 1:36:3,229
that was more like
a white person sort of sickness.


1528
1:36:3,229 --> 1:36:5,439
It wasn't coming from a black source.


1529
1:36:5,439 --> 1:36:11,821
It was the whiteness in him
that allowed it to get this bad.


1530
1:36:11,821 --> 1:36:13,781
 What did they recommend
he should do about it?


1531
1:36:13,781 --> 1:36:17,326
- They recommended
disarticulation at the hip.


1532
1:36:17,326 --> 1:36:20,121
In other words,
remove the entire leg.


1533
1:36:20,121 --> 1:36:24,83
 The doctor in England
told him he had to cut his whole leg off.


1534
1:36:24,83 --> 1:36:25,626
Was that...
Do you remember that?


1535
1:36:25,626 --> 1:36:27,128
- No.


1536
1:36:27,128 --> 1:36:31,9
Had to cut off his... his toe.


1537
1:36:31,9 --> 1:36:33,9
It was definitely not his leg.


1538
1:36:33,9 --> 1:36:37,221
- A lot of people told Bob
that once you cut your toe off...


1539
1:36:37,221 --> 1:36:38,681
your big toe especially...


1540
1:36:38,681 --> 1:36:40,516
you won't be able to dance anymore.


1541
1:36:40,516 --> 1:36:44,77
- He loved football, so...


1542
1:36:44,77 --> 1:36:47,356
I think the thought
of having his toe amputated


1543
1:36:47,356 --> 1:36:48,899
was just unacceptable to him.


1544
1:36:48,899 --> 1:36:52,945
- So, this other doctor
we saw in Miami said,


1545
1:36:52,945 --> 1:36:55,281
"No, it's not necessary.


1546
1:36:55,281 --> 1:36:58,159
We can just take off a portion of it.


1547
1:36:58,159 --> 1:37:0,161
We don't have to remove the whole toe.


1548
1:37:0,161 --> 1:37:3,372
You can just take off the whole nail bed,
and you know,


1549
1:37:3,372 --> 1:37:6,917
it wouldn't be necessary."


1550
1:37:6,917 --> 1:37:26,187
 He got very bad advice
from the people that was around him.


1551
1:37:26,187 --> 1:37:30,983



1552
1:37:30,983 --> 1:37:33,486
Until the philosophy


1553
1:37:33,486 --> 1:37:36,3
Which hold one race superior


1554
1:37:36,3 --> 1:37:39,575
And another


1555
1:37:39,575 --> 1:37:42,411
Inferior


1556
1:37:42,411 --> 1:37:45,414
Is finally


1557
1:37:45,414 --> 1:37:48,376
And permanently


1558
1:37:48,376 --> 1:37:51,87
Discredited


1559
1:37:51,87 --> 1:37:53,255
And abandoned


1560
1:37:53,255 --> 1:37:56,967
Well everywhere is war


1561
1:37:56,967 --> 1:38:0,54
Me say war


1562
1:38:0,54 --> 1:38:2,556
And until there's no longer


1563
1:38:2,556 --> 1:38:5,518
First-class nor second-class citizens


1564
1:38:5,518 --> 1:38:8,396
Of any nation


1565
1:38:8,396 --> 1:38:11,44
Until the color of a man's skin


1566
1:38:11,44 --> 1:38:13,734
Is of no more significance


1567
1:38:13,734 --> 1:38:16,278
Than the color of his eyes


1568
1:38:16,278 --> 1:38:19,698
I've got to say war


1569
1:38:19,698 --> 1:38:22,785
War in the east


1570
1:38:22,785 --> 1:38:25,246
War in the west


1571
1:38:25,246 --> 1:38:27,998
War up north


1572
1:38:27,998 --> 1:38:30,96
War down south


1573
1:38:30,96 --> 1:38:34,713
This a war


1574
1:38:34,713 --> 1:38:36,632
War


1575
1:38:36,632 --> 1:38:39,343
War


1576
1:38:39,343 --> 1:38:40,678
War


1577
1:38:40,678 --> 1:38:44,56



1578
1:38:44,56 --> 1:38:46,559
 There was a movement
to bring Bob back...


1579
1:38:46,559 --> 1:38:48,769
because it was felt
that he had the potential...


1580
1:38:48,769 --> 1:38:53,65
to heal the very strong
division that existed.


1581
1:38:53,65 --> 1:38:54,984



1582
1:38:54,984 --> 1:38:56,819
- The government was begging...


1583
1:38:56,819 --> 1:38:59,613
because they said Jamaica
is lost without Bob Marley.


1584
1:38:59,613 --> 1:39:1,866
We can't say, "Bob is in exile."


1585
1:39:1,866 --> 1:39:5,911
So they got one of their main leader,
Claudie Massop,


1586
1:39:5,911 --> 1:39:8,914
to speak to Bob.


1587
1:39:8,914 --> 1:39:11,75
- This guy, he was from
the other side of the party...


1588
1:39:11,75 --> 1:39:13,127
Claudie Massop.


1589
1:39:13,127 --> 1:39:15,421
And the next one named Tek-Life.


1590
1:39:15,421 --> 1:39:18,132
I don't remember his right name,
but we call him Tek-Life.


1591
1:39:18,132 --> 1:39:23,804
They went up to England to pursue Bob
to come down, back to Jamaica.


1592
1:39:23,804 --> 1:39:26,223
- Bob sent for them, in a way,


1593
1:39:26,223 --> 1:39:30,311
to come up, and so they would be on...
away from Jamaica,


1594
1:39:30,311 --> 1:39:32,48
away from that political influence,


1595
1:39:32,48 --> 1:39:35,524
and they could reason
among themselves.


1596
1:39:35,524 --> 1:39:39,28
 The two guys who went up there
for him was on the opposition.


1597
1:39:39,28 --> 1:39:41,53
So I would represent the other side,


1598
1:39:41,53 --> 1:39:43,782
so if he say "I don't come,"


1599
1:39:43,782 --> 1:39:46,535
then he ain't coming back to Jamaica.


1600
1:39:46,535 --> 1:39:51,749
So I have to go to England.


1601
1:39:51,749 --> 1:39:56,962
 Of those people,
how many are still alive?


1602
1:39:56,962 --> 1:39:59,59
- One.


1603
1:39:59,59 --> 1:40:3,26
The one you're speaking to.


1604
1:40:3,26 --> 1:40:5,888
We Jah people


1605
1:40:5,888 --> 1:40:10,17
Can make it work


1606
1:40:10,17 --> 1:40:13,562
Come together


1607
1:40:13,562 --> 1:40:17,483
And make it work yeah


1608
1:40:17,483 --> 1:40:20,528
I'm singing that we


1609
1:40:20,528 --> 1:40:23,28
Can make it work


1610
1:40:23,28 --> 1:40:25,241
 Bob started doing that song
which is,


1611
1:40:25,241 --> 1:40:27,868
"We, Jah people, shall come together
and make it work."


1612
1:40:27,868 --> 1:40:31,872
Then they decided to have a concert,
they'd just have a peace concert.


1613
1:40:31,872 --> 1:40:33,415
- Last month a truce was arranged...


1614
1:40:33,415 --> 1:40:36,961
between the rival political factions
in Kingston, Jamaica.


1615
1:40:36,961 --> 1:40:40,714
A peace conference was arranged,
to be preceded by a peace concert...


1616
1:40:40,714 --> 1:40:42,55
for the people in a very large park.


1617
1:40:42,55 --> 1:40:45,177
They expect over
a hundred thousand people there.


1618
1:40:45,177 --> 1:40:49,139
Bob Marley was invited to headline
this peace concert.


1619
1:40:49,139 --> 1:40:51,183
Marley has accepted...


1620
1:40:51,183 --> 1:40:53,894
and will return to Kingston, Jamaica.


1621
1:40:53,894 --> 1:40:56,63
Bob, why are you
returning to Jamaica?


1622
1:40:56,63 --> 1:40:58,65
- Well, my life not important to me.


1623
1:40:58,65 --> 1:41:0,109
Other people life important.


1624
1:41:0,109 --> 1:41:2,987
My life is only important
if me can help plenty people.


1625
1:41:2,987 --> 1:41:6,282
If my life is just me and my own security,
then me don't want it.


1626
1:41:6,282 --> 1:41:18,377
My life is for people, as many is.


1627
1:41:18,377 --> 1:41:22,798



1628
1:41:22,798 --> 1:41:26,51
 Busloads of people
went out to the airport.


1629
1:41:26,51 --> 1:41:27,886
They stormed the runway.


1630
1:41:27,886 --> 1:41:30,139
 When the plane landed,


1631
1:41:30,139 --> 1:41:32,6
they jumped over the barriers
and ran towards the plane,


1632
1:41:32,6 --> 1:41:42,943
which was similar to what happened
when Haile Selassie came to Jamaica.


1633
1:41:42,943 --> 1:41:47,781



1634
1:41:47,781 --> 1:41:51,785
 It was amazing to see
this stadium of 30,000 people.


1635
1:41:51,785 --> 1:41:54,246
People who were opposed politically...


1636
1:41:54,246 --> 1:41:56,373
were sitting beside each other.


1637
1:41:56,373 --> 1:42:9,637



1638
1:42:9,637 --> 1:42:12,973
I wanna jam with you


1639
1:42:12,973 --> 1:42:17,144
I really wanna jam it with you


1640
1:42:17,144 --> 1:42:20,481
I wanna jam with you


1641
1:42:20,481 --> 1:42:22,483
I really wanna jam it


1642
1:42:22,483 --> 1:42:24,234
I really wanna jam


1643
1:42:24,234 --> 1:42:27,863
I wanna jam with you


1644
1:42:27,863 --> 1:42:30,991
Whoa
I hope you like jammin' too


1645
1:42:30,991 --> 1:42:34,662
Well, oh, well-well
Oh, well


1646
1:42:34,662 --> 1:42:36,955



1647
1:42:36,955 --> 1:42:39,208
I wanna jam it with you
Yeah


1648
1:42:39,208 --> 1:42:42,169
Ooh. Just let me
tell you something else.


1649
1:42:42,169 --> 1:42:45,47
Yeah.
Hope you like jammin' too


1650
1:42:45,47 --> 1:42:49,218
To make everything come true,
we got to be together.


1651
1:42:49,218 --> 1:42:52,12
Yeah. Yeah.
I wanna jam it with you


1652
1:42:52,12 --> 1:42:54,973
And to the spirit of the most high,


1653
1:42:54,973 --> 1:42:58,977
His Imperial Majesty,
Emperor Haile Selassie I,


1654
1:42:58,977 --> 1:43:2,231
from writing to...


1655
1:43:2,231 --> 1:43:4,65
leading people...


1656
1:43:4,65 --> 1:43:6,902
of the slavery to be here...


1657
1:43:6,902 --> 1:43:8,57
to shake hands.


1658
1:43:8,57 --> 1:43:11,573
Show the people that you love them right


1659
1:43:11,573 --> 1:43:15,911
Show the people that you gonna unite


1660
1:43:15,911 --> 1:43:19,39
Show the people that we're all right


1661
1:43:19,39 --> 1:43:22,167
Show the people
that everything is all right


1662
1:43:22,167 --> 1:43:24,128
 I actually played
a wrong note.


1663
1:43:24,128 --> 1:43:25,671



1664
1:43:25,671 --> 1:43:27,881
He started singing,
"Whoa, watch what you're doing."


1665
1:43:27,881 --> 1:43:30,801
Watch watch watch
watch watch watch watch


1666
1:43:30,801 --> 1:43:32,594
Watch what you're doing


1667
1:43:32,594 --> 1:43:34,513
- Everybody thought he was trying
to tell the people out there,


1668
1:43:34,513 --> 1:43:41,895
"Watch what you're doing."
But he was really talking to me.


1669
1:43:41,895 --> 1:43:43,564
- He was very spiritual.


1670
1:43:43,564 --> 1:43:49,111
This was like, "Hey."


1671
1:43:49,111 --> 1:43:51,905
I'm trying to say


1672
1:43:51,905 --> 1:43:53,574
Could we have...


1673
1:43:53,574 --> 1:43:56,994
Could we have up here, on stage here,


1674
1:43:56,994 --> 1:44:1,957
the presence of Mr. Michael Manley
and Mr. Edward Seaga?


1675
1:44:1,957 --> 1:44:5,127
Whoa


1676
1:44:5,127 --> 1:44:7,629
I just want to shake hands
and show the people...


1677
1:44:7,629 --> 1:44:10,9
that we gonna be all right.


1678
1:44:10,9 --> 1:44:11,967
We gonna unite


1679
1:44:11,967 --> 1:44:14,136
We're gonna make them right


1680
1:44:14,136 --> 1:44:15,637
We got to unite


1681
1:44:15,637 --> 1:44:20,309



1682
1:44:20,309 --> 1:44:25,606
 He didn't plan it at all.
It was spontaneous.


1683
1:44:25,606 --> 1:44:28,275
- I'm waiting.
I'm waiting.


1684
1:44:28,275 --> 1:44:31,28
Oh Lord oh Lord


1685
1:44:31,28 --> 1:44:37,34
Help us out I pray


1686
1:44:37,34 --> 1:44:39,119
 Anything could have
happened at that point.


1687
1:44:39,119 --> 1:44:47,336
I was just praying that the people didn't
get foolish and start shooting again.


1688
1:44:47,336 --> 1:44:49,88
 There were no preachment
or anything like that.


1689
1:44:49,88 --> 1:44:55,52
He just took our hands and said
a few words, held it up above his head.


1690
1:44:55,52 --> 1:44:58,889
And at that moment,
everybody was one.


1691
1:44:58,889 --> 1:45:0,39
- Love.


1692
1:45:0,39 --> 1:45:2,1
Prosperity.


1693
1:45:2,1 --> 1:45:5,2
Be with us all. Jah.


1694
1:45:5,2 --> 1:45:7,856
Rastafari. Selassie.


1695
1:45:7,856 --> 1:45:14,321



1696
1:45:14,321 --> 1:45:16,74
 He was able to do that.


1697
1:45:16,74 --> 1:45:19,785
He was able to bring people
together in that way.


1698
1:45:19,785 --> 1:45:23,413
The same half uptown, half downtown,
half black, half white.


1699
1:45:23,413 --> 1:45:25,624
It's that marriage of everything.


1700
1:45:25,624 --> 1:45:42,224
He just embodied it
all in one person.


1701
1:45:42,224 --> 1:45:45,269
 As his career grows,
so grew a better education,


1702
1:45:45,269 --> 1:45:49,64
and a better car,
and a bigger house with more rooms.


1703
1:45:49,64 --> 1:45:53,986
But my father would always
take us back to Trench Town.


1704
1:45:53,986 --> 1:45:56,238
 Sometime Bob would go
down the ghetto and, you know,


1705
1:45:56,238 --> 1:46:0,868
pass through and thing like that
and would never lock his car up.


1706
1:46:0,868 --> 1:46:4,121
'Cause that's like saying
you don't trust people.


1707
1:46:4,121 --> 1:46:6,79
 Have you made a lot of money
out of your music?


1708
1:46:6,79 --> 1:46:9,1
- Money.


1709
1:46:9,1 --> 1:46:10,711
I mean, what is a...
How much is...


1710
1:46:10,711 --> 1:46:12,254
How much is a lot of money to you?


1711
1:46:12,254 --> 1:46:16,967
- That's a good question.
Have you made, say, millions of dollars?


1712
1:46:16,967 --> 1:46:18,385
- No.


1713
1:46:18,385 --> 1:46:20,345
- Are you a rich man?


1714
1:46:20,345 --> 1:46:22,347
- When you mean rich, what you mean?


1715
1:46:22,347 --> 1:46:25,392
- Do you have a lot of possessions,
a lot of money in the bank?


1716
1:46:25,392 --> 1:46:26,935
- Possession make you rich?


1717
1:46:26,935 --> 1:46:32,149
I don't have that type of riches.
My riches is life forever.


1718
1:46:32,149 --> 1:46:34,61
 Hope Road
was always swarming with people,


1719
1:46:34,61 --> 1:46:36,278
and for the same reason...


1720
1:46:36,278 --> 1:46:39,156
looking for an opportunity,
looking for some money,


1721
1:46:39,156 --> 1:46:41,158
looking for a handout, need a job...


1722
1:46:41,158 --> 1:46:43,535
"My children's school fees,"
on and on and on.


1723
1:46:43,535 --> 1:46:46,538
 You have lines every day
at Hope Road.


1724
1:46:46,538 --> 1:46:50,751
People from all walks...
They bring the baby, they bring the kids.


1725
1:46:50,751 --> 1:46:54,212
You have long lines,
and he just hand out...


1726
1:46:54,212 --> 1:46:56,214
He doesn't just give, like, pittance,
you know.


1727
1:46:56,214 --> 1:47:0,385
He give you enough that
you can start something, you know.


1728
1:47:0,385 --> 1:47:4,222
 A couple of years ago,
no one would have believed...


1729
1:47:4,222 --> 1:47:7,267
that this raggle-taggle
tribe of Jamaican musicians...


1730
1:47:7,267 --> 1:47:10,27
would be packing
Toronto's Maple Leaf Gardens.


1731
1:47:10,27 --> 1:47:12,481
It's a sign of reggae's
growing acceptance...


1732
1:47:12,481 --> 1:47:15,25
in the international pop music scene.


1733
1:47:15,25 --> 1:47:21,323
And it's also catapulted this man,
Bob Marley, to superstardom.


1734
1:47:21,323 --> 1:47:23,33
We don't need no trouble


1735
1:47:23,33 --> 1:47:25,16
No no no no


1736
1:47:25,16 --> 1:47:27,955
- Bob once made a statement.
He said they ask him,


1737
1:47:27,955 --> 1:47:30,165
"How big you think this music will get?"


1738
1:47:30,165 --> 1:47:34,753
Bob says, "You know, this music
will get bigger and bigger and bigger...


1739
1:47:34,753 --> 1:47:37,631
till it reaches right people."


1740
1:47:37,631 --> 1:47:40,342
Which, to me, is the whole world.


1741
1:47:40,342 --> 1:47:46,515



1742
1:47:46,515 --> 1:47:49,851



1743
1:47:49,851 --> 1:48:7,744
- Yes, you know, come a long way.


1744
1:48:7,744 --> 1:48:9,538
Lively up yourself


1745
1:48:9,538 --> 1:48:13,875
And don't be no drag


1746
1:48:13,875 --> 1:48:16,42
Lively up yourself


1747
1:48:16,42 --> 1:48:20,257
For reggae is another bag


1748
1:48:20,257 --> 1:48:22,801
I watched from 200-seaters...


1749
1:48:22,801 --> 1:48:26,93
to a thousand, and then I saw 80,000.


1750
1:48:26,93 --> 1:48:29,99
I saw a hundred thousand.


1751
1:48:29,99 --> 1:48:31,852
'Cause I said so


1752
1:48:31,852 --> 1:48:36,356
What you gonna do
You rock so you rock so


1753
1:48:36,356 --> 1:48:37,816
 We tore up Europe.


1754
1:48:37,816 --> 1:48:41,903
We played to, like, maybe
two million people in six weeks.


1755
1:48:41,903 --> 1:48:45,699
We broke everybody's record over there.
The Rolling Stones...


1756
1:48:45,699 --> 1:48:49,244
You skank so
You skank so


1757
1:48:49,244 --> 1:48:52,456
Oh yeah


1758
1:48:52,456 --> 1:48:55,125
You come so
You come so


1759
1:48:55,125 --> 1:48:58,837
Come alive today yeah


1760
1:48:58,837 --> 1:49:1,173
And lively up yourself


1761
1:49:1,173 --> 1:49:3,467



1762
1:49:3,467 --> 1:49:5,469
- Yeah!


1763
1:49:5,469 --> 1:49:9,806
 He did a concert in Tokyo...
4,000 people.


1764
1:49:9,806 --> 1:49:11,558
Everybody's totally Japanese.


1765
1:49:11,558 --> 1:49:15,103
Singing every song word for word.


1766
1:49:15,103 --> 1:49:18,69
 Most of them could not
even understand.


1767
1:49:18,69 --> 1:49:20,15
They spoke a different language.


1768
1:49:20,15 --> 1:49:24,571
But they felt the music and
they knew what he was saying.


1769
1:49:24,571 --> 1:49:26,698
Lively up yourself


1770
1:49:26,698 --> 1:49:30,368
In the morning time Lord


1771
1:49:30,368 --> 1:49:37,417
 The media lied and said
that Bob smoke a pound a day.


1772
1:49:37,417 --> 1:49:40,962
And so everywhere we went,
the police was on our heels,


1773
1:49:40,962 --> 1:49:47,177
and they would search our belongings
with a fine-toothed comb.


1774
1:49:47,177 --> 1:49:51,98
You would see police
with dogs on the bus, searching.


1775
1:49:51,98 --> 1:49:54,267
But every time they searched,
they never found anything.


1776
1:49:54,267 --> 1:50:0,107
So, they didn't bother with us again.


1777
1:50:0,107 --> 1:50:3,68
 Towards the latter years,
they're more, like,


1778
1:50:3,68 --> 1:50:5,779
"You have any posters?" like.


1779
1:50:5,779 --> 1:50:9,449
So we basically just came out
with the passports,


1780
1:50:9,449 --> 1:50:12,119
a whole bunch of records and posters,


1781
1:50:12,119 --> 1:50:36,393
and they didn't even look,
they just stamped.


1782
1:50:36,393 --> 1:50:41,64



1783
1:50:41,64 --> 1:50:46,236
- One of his main concern was
that he wasn't reaching the black people.


1784
1:50:46,236 --> 1:50:49,573
You know, he's noticed all his shows
are all white, all white, every show,


1785
1:50:49,573 --> 1:50:51,408
so that kind of was puzzling to him.


1786
1:50:51,408 --> 1:50:55,12
- I was in Nigeria and came back
and told him about the response...


1787
1:50:55,12 --> 1:50:56,788
of the people to him in Nigeria,


1788
1:50:56,788 --> 1:50:59,249
who had never seen him,
but just the music.


1789
1:50:59,249 --> 1:51:2,46
And he couldn't believe it.
I said, "Yes, I'm serious."


1790
1:51:2,46 --> 1:51:5,338
I said, "Africa is really waiting for you.


1791
1:51:5,338 --> 1:51:10,385
As a matter of fact, if you go to Africa,
you really might not come back."


1792
1:51:10,385 --> 1:51:43,251



1793
1:51:43,251 --> 1:51:47,5
Check out the real situation


1794
1:51:47,5 --> 1:51:50,759
Nation war against nation


1795
1:51:50,759 --> 1:51:53,261
Where did it all begin


1796
1:51:53,261 --> 1:51:56,14
 Her father was
the president of Gabon.


1797
1:51:56,14 --> 1:51:58,225
 We didn't know he was a dictator
when we went, but we found out.


1798
1:51:58,225 --> 1:52:6,566
It was, like, "Okay, we're here.
It's too late. Let's just play."


1799
1:52:6,566 --> 1:52:10,237
And his daughter
was in love with Bob.


1800
1:52:10,237 --> 1:52:23,708



1801
1:52:23,708 --> 1:52:26,127
 To Bob, Africa is
the motherland, you know,


1802
1:52:26,127 --> 1:52:28,755
and he loved Jamaica,
but he was in transit.


1803
1:52:28,755 --> 1:52:31,508
Africa was his destination.


1804
1:52:31,508 --> 1:52:34,1
And everything is just for a while


1805
1:52:34,1 --> 1:52:37,514
It seems like total destruction


1806
1:52:37,514 --> 1:52:38,765
The only solution


1807
1:52:38,765 --> 1:52:42,519
 You don't die and go to heaven.
You have to live in heaven.


1808
1:52:42,519 --> 1:52:49,776
Africa is our heaven because
that's where we come from.


1809
1:52:49,776 --> 1:53:29,524



1810
1:53:29,524 --> 1:53:33,403
- Everywhere we went, the kids
were running beside the bus...


1811
1:53:33,403 --> 1:53:35,488
and waving and hollering,


1812
1:53:35,488 --> 1:53:38,241
"Bob Marley! Bob Marley!
Ganja! Ganja!"


1813
1:53:38,241 --> 1:53:42,495
We said, "Uh-oh."


1814
1:53:42,495 --> 1:54:1,89



1815
1:54:1,89 --> 1:54:4,726
- Bob asked me to find out
from Pascaline...


1816
1:54:4,726 --> 1:54:7,604
how much money
we were actually paid.


1817
1:54:7,604 --> 1:54:14,152
And what she told me was a lot more money
than what Bob was told by Don.


1818
1:54:14,152 --> 1:54:26,873



1819
1:54:26,873 --> 1:54:29,334
- He kick him down.


1820
1:54:29,334 --> 1:54:32,587
Leapt across the room
and kick him down.


1821
1:54:32,587 --> 1:54:35,6
- Yeah, I saw him kick his ass.


1822
1:54:35,6 --> 1:54:39,886
In fact, we questioned him
for almost three hours that night on tape.


1823
1:54:39,886 --> 1:54:41,763
- We were on the 23rd floor,


1824
1:54:41,763 --> 1:54:45,433
and they kind of held Don
outside the window for a minute.


1825
1:54:45,433 --> 1:54:48,77
- Bob would ask him the same question,
like, maybe half an hour later,


1826
1:54:48,77 --> 1:54:50,814
and he answered different,


1827
1:54:50,814 --> 1:54:53,775
and Bob said, "Garrick, rewind."


1828
1:54:53,775 --> 1:54:55,819
Ding! Play.


1829
1:54:55,819 --> 1:54:58,113
And then, "Wasn't you said that, boy?"


1830
1:54:58,113 --> 1:55:1,408
Slap him couple of times.
Shit!


1831
1:55:1,408 --> 1:55:5,328
Hey!


1832
1:55:5,328 --> 1:55:9,833
 It was the policy
of keeping Africans in their place,


1833
1:55:9,833 --> 1:55:11,709
which, by 1965,


1834
1:55:11,709 --> 1:55:15,922
made Rhodesia illegal
in the eyes of the world.


1835
1:55:15,922 --> 1:55:20,51
- I don't believe in black majority rule
ever in Rhodesia.


1836
1:55:20,51 --> 1:55:29,894
Not in a thousand years.


1837
1:55:29,894 --> 1:55:31,896
 Bob wrote a song
called "Zimbabwe."


1838
1:55:31,896 --> 1:55:34,149
"Natty mash it in-a Zimbabwe.


1839
1:55:34,149 --> 1:55:36,484
I 'n' I liberate Zimbabwe."


1840
1:55:36,484 --> 1:55:38,445
And when the song got to Zimbabwe,


1841
1:55:38,445 --> 1:55:41,656
the freedom fighters
embraced that as their anthem.


1842
1:55:41,656 --> 1:55:43,741
- They got their independence.


1843
1:55:43,741 --> 1:55:46,369
Finally, they got their independence,


1844
1:55:46,369 --> 1:55:49,914
and they sent representatives
here to Jamaica...


1845
1:55:49,914 --> 1:55:52,125
to ask Bob to perform.


1846
1:55:52,125 --> 1:55:55,587
- They wanted him to come,
and when they saw the cost,


1847
1:55:55,587 --> 1:55:57,38
they said they couldn't afford it.


1848
1:55:57,38 --> 1:56:1,5
- And so Bob Marley used his own money...


1849
1:56:1,5 --> 1:56:9,267
and shipped equipment, I think,
from London to Zimbabwe.


1850
1:56:9,267 --> 1:56:10,727
Zimbabwe


1851
1:56:10,727 --> 1:56:14,898
Africans a-liberate Zimbabwe


1852
1:56:14,898 --> 1:56:18,443
 You had dignitaries
from all over the world.


1853
1:56:18,443 --> 1:56:23,72
You're right you're right
you're right you're


1854
1:56:23,72 --> 1:56:29,37



1855
1:56:29,37 --> 1:56:32,582
- I, Robert Gabriel Mugabe,


1856
1:56:32,582 --> 1:56:37,795
do swear that I will well
and truly serve Zimbabwe...


1857
1:56:37,795 --> 1:56:41,257
in the office of minister
of the government,


1858
1:56:41,257 --> 1:56:43,343
so help me God.


1859
1:56:43,343 --> 1:56:47,639



1860
1:56:47,639 --> 1:56:51,59
 Midnight, the exact moment
of independence.


1861
1:56:51,59 --> 1:56:52,727
As Prince Charles, Governor Soames


1862
1:56:52,727 --> 1:56:55,63
and hundreds of visiting
heads of government...


1863
1:56:55,63 --> 1:56:57,607
and V.I.P.s from around
the world watched,


1864
1:56:57,607 --> 1:57:1,736
the new flag was raised,
Robert Mugabe's government assumed power,


1865
1:57:1,736 --> 1:57:9,786
and Zimbabwe was born.


1866
1:57:9,786 --> 1:57:12,497
Exodus


1867
1:57:12,497 --> 1:57:14,29
Oh Lord


1868
1:57:14,29 --> 1:57:20,755
Movement of Jah people


1869
1:57:20,755 --> 1:57:23,8
 It was the first time
anybody in Zimbabwe...


1870
1:57:23,8 --> 1:57:25,718
had heard anything like this.


1871
1:57:25,718 --> 1:57:28,555
But when the first song started,


1872
1:57:28,555 --> 1:57:30,223
the 90,000 people outside,


1873
1:57:30,223 --> 1:57:33,768
who couldn't get in,
decided to come in.


1874
1:57:33,768 --> 1:57:36,229
Men and people will fight you down


1875
1:57:36,229 --> 1:57:39,399
When you see Jah light


1876
1:57:39,399 --> 1:57:41,359
Let me tell you if you're not wrong


1877
1:57:41,359 --> 1:57:43,403
 It was the freedom fighters...


1878
1:57:43,403 --> 1:57:45,613
heard Bob Marley inside the stadium,


1879
1:57:45,613 --> 1:57:49,2
and they are locked out,
not being able to go in,


1880
1:57:49,2 --> 1:57:51,869
and they just flattened the fence.


1881
1:57:51,869 --> 1:57:54,664
So, being there, on stage,


1882
1:57:54,664 --> 1:57:56,416
I remember I was the first person


1883
1:57:56,416 --> 1:57:58,96
to smell something unusual.


1884
1:57:58,96 --> 1:58:1,546
It was tear gas.


1885
1:58:1,546 --> 1:58:6,134
 There was this strange sensation
that was burning our throats,


1886
1:58:6,134 --> 1:58:8,761
and it felt as if we were gonna die.


1887
1:58:8,761 --> 1:58:12,515
We didn't know what it was,
and we felt that we're gonna leave Jamaica,


1888
1:58:12,515 --> 1:58:16,561
and come all the way to Zimbabwe
to leave our kids and just die here.


1889
1:58:16,561 --> 1:58:19,355
So, Rita, Marcie and I,


1890
1:58:19,355 --> 1:58:21,316
we ran off the stage,


1891
1:58:21,316 --> 1:58:23,86
and the musicians
were coming off one by one.


1892
1:58:23,86 --> 1:58:26,529
But Bob was still
in his element, and he...


1893
1:58:26,529 --> 1:58:34,329
I guess he didn't even realize
what was happening.


1894
1:58:34,329 --> 1:58:36,39
- That just open my eyes to know


1895
1:58:36,39 --> 1:58:39,709
that this man was ready
to go down with his people.


1896
1:58:39,709 --> 1:58:44,464
Whatever the reason was,
Bob didn't run nowhere.


1897
1:58:44,464 --> 1:58:45,673



1898
1:58:45,673 --> 1:58:48,134
So when we got back on stage with Bob,


1899
1:58:48,134 --> 1:58:50,303
this is what Bob said to us:


1900
1:58:50,303 --> 1:58:54,766
"Now I know who are
the true revolutionaries."


1901
1:58:54,766 --> 1:58:58,686
Well well well well
Jah come to break oppression


1902
1:58:58,686 --> 1:59:2,273
Rule equality yeah


1903
1:59:2,273 --> 1:59:5,26
Wipe away transgression


1904
1:59:5,26 --> 1:59:7,82
Set the captives free


1905
1:59:7,82 --> 1:59:10,865
Set the captives free now


1906
1:59:10,865 --> 1:59:14,77
Set


1907
1:59:14,77 --> 1:59:19,624
Set the captives free yeah


1908
1:59:19,624 --> 1:59:24,545
 And I think that was
one of his highlights of a dream.


1909
1:59:24,545 --> 1:59:31,803
He was at home.


1910
1:59:31,803 --> 1:59:34,263
Thank you very much. Zimbabwe!


1911
1:59:34,263 --> 1:59:38,851
Freedom!


1912
1:59:38,851 --> 1:59:41,688



1913
1:59:41,688 --> 1:59:44,273
 Did Bob want to reach
a black audience in America?


1914
1:59:44,273 --> 1:59:45,942
- Of course he did.


1915
1:59:45,942 --> 1:59:47,777
Bob, until he died, he did.


1916
1:59:47,777 --> 1:59:51,823
The last concert in New York
was to try to get...


1917
1:59:51,823 --> 1:59:56,577
African American,
R & B airplay in America.


1918
1:59:56,577 --> 2:0:0,707
Bob had a cult following in America,


1919
2:0:0,707 --> 2:0:3,668
and when you go to a Bob Marley concert,
it was sold out,


1920
2:0:3,668 --> 2:0:10,883
but it was white.


1921
2:0:10,883 --> 2:0:13,386
 Yeah, the black people
in America were not responding.


1922
2:0:13,386 --> 2:0:14,846
It was always a big thing.


1923
2:0:14,846 --> 2:0:18,975
We always talked about it.
We always wondered why.


1924
2:0:18,975 --> 2:0:22,311
 So, Frankie Crocker,
the number-one jock in the country...


1925
2:0:22,311 --> 2:0:25,69
said that I got a concert
with The Commodores.


1926
2:0:25,69 --> 2:0:28,568
"We'll guarantee you
three months of airplay...


1927
2:0:28,568 --> 2:0:31,404
if Bob would open
for the Commodores."


1928
2:0:31,404 --> 2:0:33,322
We said, "You gotta be crazy.


1929
2:0:33,322 --> 2:0:36,909
The Commodores should be opening
the show for Bob Marley, not in reverse."


1930
2:0:36,909 --> 2:0:39,912
I went back to Bob,
and Bob said, "No problem."


1931
2:0:39,912 --> 2:1:0,391



1932
2:1:0,391 --> 2:1:5,48
Could you be loved


1933
2:1:5,48 --> 2:1:10,443
And be loved


1934
2:1:10,443 --> 2:1:15,698
Could you be loved


1935
2:1:15,698 --> 2:1:20,411
And be loved


1936
2:1:20,411 --> 2:1:23,289
Don't let them fool ya


1937
2:1:23,289 --> 2:1:29,17
Oh, no


1938
2:1:29,17 --> 2:1:32,799
Or even try to school ya


1939
2:1:32,799 --> 2:1:37,678
Oh, no


1940
2:1:37,678 --> 2:1:41,307
 When we did
the Madison Square Garden show,


1941
2:1:41,307 --> 2:1:44,6
that night was history.


1942
2:1:44,6 --> 2:1:48,314
If what you're thinking is not right


1943
2:1:48,314 --> 2:1:51,609
Love will never leave us alone


1944
2:1:51,609 --> 2:1:54,195
Every single one
that was in the audience...


1945
2:1:54,195 --> 2:1:58,115
stood on their feet
to acknowledge this man.


1946
2:1:58,115 --> 2:2:0,326
Whoa-ho


1947
2:2:0,326 --> 2:2:5,164
Could you be loved


1948
2:2:5,164 --> 2:2:10,169
And be loved


1949
2:2:10,169 --> 2:2:14,966
Could you be loved


1950
2:2:14,966 --> 2:2:17,718
And be loved


1951
2:2:17,718 --> 2:2:19,262
Oh


1952
2:2:19,262 --> 2:2:22,56
Could you be loved
Could you be could you be loved


1953
2:2:22,56 --> 2:2:28,813
 I think the doors of America
was opened to Bob right there.


1954
2:2:28,813 --> 2:2:40,199



1955
2:2:40,199 --> 2:2:42,535
Marley! Marley! Marley!


1956
2:2:42,535 --> 2:2:46,747
Marley! Marley! Marley!
Marley! Marley!


1957
2:2:46,747 --> 2:2:52,67
Marley! Marley! Marley!
Marley! Marley! Marley!


1958
2:2:52,67 --> 2:2:57,466



1959
2:2:57,466 --> 2:3:0,553
 The next day,
we were out in Central Park jogging,


1960
2:3:0,553 --> 2:3:5,433
and we was going up this hill,
and all of a sudden he...


1961
2:3:5,433 --> 2:3:7,31
he stumbled,


1962
2:3:7,31 --> 2:3:10,938
and we went and we laid him down
on the side of the trail,


1963
2:3:10,938 --> 2:3:15,234
and he... he started shaking,
and he had foaming at the mouth.


1964
2:3:15,234 --> 2:3:18,863
And I said... when I looked at him,
he looked real strange.


1965
2:3:18,863 --> 2:3:23,159
And the guys gathered around him,
they said something in patois.


1966
2:3:23,159 --> 2:3:26,12
And he hollered "Rastafari"
and jumped up off the ground.


1967
2:3:26,12 --> 2:3:29,373
Scared me to death. I mean,
he was there, shaking and foaming.


1968
2:3:29,373 --> 2:3:34,67
Next thing I know, he done...
he just jumped up.


1969
2:3:34,67 --> 2:3:39,133
 We took him to the hospital
next door to my house.


1970
2:3:39,133 --> 2:3:42,94
The doctor told Alan and me...


1971
2:3:42,94 --> 2:3:46,432
that Bob Marley had cancer
and that it had spread.


1972
2:3:46,432 --> 2:3:50,186
- He had cancer all over his body...


1973
2:3:50,186 --> 2:3:53,606
lungs, brain, all over the place.


1974
2:3:53,606 --> 2:3:57,86
It was incredible that
he was able to keep working.


1975
2:3:57,86 --> 2:4:3,32
 But the doctor told us
that we shouldn't do anything,


1976
2:4:3,32 --> 2:4:6,661
that we should just let him
stay on the concert tour,


1977
2:4:6,661 --> 2:4:8,788
that he was so strong and powerful,


1978
2:4:8,788 --> 2:4:13,876
that one day he was gonna walk out on stage
and he was gonna fall dead.


1979
2:4:13,876 --> 2:4:16,462
But that he could not be treated...


1980
2:4:16,462 --> 2:4:20,49
and he could not be helped.


1981
2:4:20,49 --> 2:4:21,634
How did he take the news?


1982
2:4:21,634 --> 2:4:28,182
- Bad.
He took the news bad.


1983
2:4:28,182 --> 2:4:31,143
 I knew he'd had a problem
with his toe before that,


1984
2:4:31,143 --> 2:4:32,853
but...


1985
2:4:32,853 --> 2:4:35,731
I'd forgotten about it.


1986
2:4:35,731 --> 2:4:38,25
I think everybody seemed
to have forgotten about it...


1987
2:4:38,25 --> 2:4:42,29
because if he'd been going
to regular checkups,


1988
2:4:42,29 --> 2:4:45,825
you know, he might...
he might be around today.


1989
2:4:45,825 --> 2:4:48,452
But...
- He just didn't go to his checkups?


1990
2:4:48,452 --> 2:4:58,629
- No.


1991
2:4:58,629 --> 2:5:2,174
 The next stop was Pittsburgh,


1992
2:5:2,174 --> 2:5:6,95
and we were waiting for Bob
to come on the bus...


1993
2:5:6,95 --> 2:5:8,639
for all of us
to drive to Pittsburgh.


1994
2:5:8,639 --> 2:5:13,853
And we never saw Bob.


1995
2:5:13,853 --> 2:5:15,98
- Finally, he arrived,


1996
2:5:15,98 --> 2:5:19,108
and he was looking very,
very stressed, I remember,


1997
2:5:19,108 --> 2:5:22,82
and we went to do a sound check,


1998
2:5:22,82 --> 2:5:26,866
and I remember
we did the sound check...


1999
2:5:26,866 --> 2:5:28,951
with one song...


2000
2:5:28,951 --> 2:5:32,371
and we did that song
for maybe two or three hours.


2001
2:5:32,371 --> 2:5:36,167
"I'm Hurting Inside."


2002
2:5:36,167 --> 2:5:39,879
 It's the longest sound check
we have ever had.


2003
2:5:39,879 --> 2:5:49,221
It just felt like, "Why?"
We didn't understand.


2004
2:5:49,221 --> 2:5:52,16
- We had a meeting before the show,
half an hour before the show,


2005
2:5:52,16 --> 2:5:57,48
and we were told by Alan Cole that this was
gonna be our last concert.


2006
2:5:57,48 --> 2:6:0,983
And, of course,
we were all, like, in shock.


2007
2:6:0,983 --> 2:6:3,277
 Before we went on stage,
he said to me,


2008
2:6:3,277 --> 2:6:6,697
"I want you to stay pretty close
in case anything should happen."


2009
2:6:6,697 --> 2:6:9,492
I'm saying, "Nothing's gonna happen to you.
Everything's gonna be all right."


2010
2:6:9,492 --> 2:6:13,788
But he just said, "Stay close, in case."
Just in case he got a seizure.


2011
2:6:13,788 --> 2:6:16,707
I wanna love you


2012
2:6:16,707 --> 2:6:19,43
I wanna love and treat


2013
2:6:19,43 --> 2:6:21,295
Love and treat you right


2014
2:6:21,295 --> 2:6:24,298
 He put on the show,
but it wasn't the same.


2015
2:6:24,298 --> 2:6:26,675
He didn't have the same energy.


2016
2:6:26,675 --> 2:6:29,97
But the people kept him
pumped up 'cause this...


2017
2:6:29,97 --> 2:6:36,185
so many people in the audience,
and they were, "Bob! Bob!"


2018
2:6:36,185 --> 2:6:38,479
 They called for an encore,
and we were saying,


2019
2:6:38,479 --> 2:6:40,481
"Lord, I wonder if he can do it."


2020
2:6:40,481 --> 2:6:47,905
And he went out, and he did
the encore. He did about four songs.


2021
2:6:47,905 --> 2:6:51,325
And they called for another encore,
and I'm saying,


2022
2:6:51,325 --> 2:6:54,912
"Jesus, I wonder if he's gonna fall out
on this one."


2023
2:6:54,912 --> 2:6:56,664
But he did it.


2024
2:6:56,664 --> 2:6:58,582
He did it.


2025
2:6:58,582 --> 2:7:9,385
And that was the last time
we performed on stage together.


2026
2:7:9,385 --> 2:7:11,387



2027
2:7:11,387 --> 2:7:14,473
 Thank you very much,
Pittsburgh! Yeah.


2028
2:7:14,473 --> 2:7:17,852



2029
2:7:17,852 --> 2:7:21,689
If you keep jumping like this,
we'll have to come here every year!


2030
2:7:21,689 --> 2:7:25,651
Every week, every month!


2031
2:7:25,651 --> 2:7:31,866
Thank you.


2032
2:7:31,866 --> 2:7:34,201
 I was with him the whole time
in New York...


2033
2:7:34,201 --> 2:7:35,953
when he was being treated
at Sloan-Kettering.


2034
2:7:35,953 --> 2:7:37,413
I was with him every day.


2035
2:7:37,413 --> 2:7:46,46
I was with him when he was getting chemo,
and his locks fell out.


2036
2:7:46,46 --> 2:7:48,507
 The weight of the locks
was just too heavy.


2037
2:7:48,507 --> 2:7:52,94
The few hairs that were still holding
was beginning to be really uncomfortable,


2038
2:7:52,94 --> 2:7:54,96
and he decided to cut it.


2039
2:7:54,96 --> 2:7:58,434
That was quite a night.


2040
2:7:58,434 --> 2:8:2,396
It was myself, Rita...
a group of us women.


2041
2:8:2,396 --> 2:8:5,983
We lit candles, and we were reading
from the Bible.


2042
2:8:5,983 --> 2:8:8,444
We were reading the Book of Job,


2043
2:8:8,444 --> 2:8:11,947
and, uh, we cut.


2044
2:8:11,947 --> 2:8:16,535
- I said to him, um,


2045
2:8:16,535 --> 2:8:18,954
"You going for the Rude Boy look?"


2046
2:8:18,954 --> 2:8:23,25
And he laughed. It was funny.
But it was really, really sad.


2047
2:8:23,25 --> 2:8:27,671
About the saddest thing
I can ever remember.


2048
2:8:27,671 --> 2:8:32,635
- That was the first time I saw him,


2049
2:8:32,635 --> 2:8:34,887
like, without his hair.


2050
2:8:34,887 --> 2:8:57,785
You know, he looked, like, so tiny.


2051
2:8:57,785 --> 2:9:0,913
 Him say, "Listen,
we're gonna fight it. All right?


2052
2:9:0,913 --> 2:9:4,792
Regardless of what the doctors might say
or what they might do,


2053
2:9:4,792 --> 2:9:7,169
we're gonna fight it.


2054
2:9:7,169 --> 2:9:9,88
'Cause a Rasta never give up."


2055
2:9:9,88 --> 2:9:11,882
- Left to me, I would have said,


2056
2:9:11,882 --> 2:9:13,425
"Bob, come home to Saint Ann


2057
2:9:13,425 --> 2:9:15,94
and come eat roast fish
and callaloo every day.


2058
2:9:15,94 --> 2:9:17,137
Smoke the biggest spliff if you like,


2059
2:9:17,137 --> 2:9:21,58
drink fish tea, just do what you want.


2060
2:9:21,58 --> 2:9:24,353
And if you end up in the same place
at the end of it all,


2061
2:9:24,353 --> 2:9:27,606
at least you will have had some comfort


2062
2:9:27,606 --> 2:9:30,192
in your last months on this earth...


2063
2:9:30,192 --> 2:9:33,529
and being in a place that you really,
really wanted to be in."


2064
2:9:33,529 --> 2:9:36,31
But we girls didn't have much talk
in those days, you know.


2065
2:9:36,31 --> 2:9:38,909
The men made the decisions.


2066
2:9:38,909 --> 2:9:47,293



2067
2:9:47,293 --> 2:9:51,964
Old pirates yes they rob I


2068
2:9:51,964 --> 2:9:56,802
Sold I to the merchant ships


2069
2:9:56,802 --> 2:10:0,973
Minutes after they took I


2070
2:10:0,973 --> 2:10:4,101
From the bottomless pit


2071
2:10:4,101 --> 2:10:9,315
But my hand was made strong


2072
2:10:9,315 --> 2:10:12,651
By the hand of the Almighty


2073
2:10:12,651 --> 2:10:18,324
We forward in this generation


2074
2:10:18,324 --> 2:10:21,827
Triumphantly


2075
2:10:21,827 --> 2:10:26,749
Won't you help to sing


2076
2:10:26,749 --> 2:10:29,96
These songs of freedom


2077
2:10:29,96 --> 2:10:35,215
'Cause all I ever have


2078
2:10:35,215 --> 2:10:39,219
Redemption songs


2079
2:10:39,219 --> 2:10:43,182
Redemption songs


2080
2:10:43,182 --> 2:10:45,768
 He was living
in a house just down the road.


2081
2:10:45,768 --> 2:10:48,604
It was actually in walking distance
from the clinic.


2082
2:10:48,604 --> 2:10:53,4
But I mean, you had to put boots on halfway
up your thigh to get through the snow.


2083
2:10:53,4 --> 2:10:58,572
 I'm telling you, I had to wear
dark glasses because it was so white.


2084
2:10:58,572 --> 2:11:1,283
The lake was frozen three feet deep.


2085
2:11:1,283 --> 2:11:4,78
You could drive a car over it.


2086
2:11:4,78 --> 2:11:8,29
I said, "This is a fridge
where they keep people alive."


2087
2:11:8,29 --> 2:11:12,795
No, Rottach-Egern...
I'll never forget that.


2088
2:11:12,795 --> 2:11:16,6
 Dr. Josef Issels
was the ultimate...


2089
2:11:16,6 --> 2:11:17,966
in holistic therapy at that time.


2090
2:11:17,966 --> 2:11:20,302
But what made him more interesting,
he was the only doctor...


2091
2:11:20,302 --> 2:11:26,35
who had actually cured
a melanoma on the planet Earth.


2092
2:11:26,35 --> 2:12:7,349



2093
2:12:7,349 --> 2:12:12,563
- I went to Germany for his, uh,
36th birthday.


2094
2:12:12,563 --> 2:12:15,899
Rita was there.
Cindy was there.


2095
2:12:15,899 --> 2:12:19,236
His mom was there.


2096
2:12:19,236 --> 2:12:21,655
It was kind of frustrating in a sense...


2097
2:12:21,655 --> 2:12:25,284
because I know the type of person Bob is.


2098
2:12:25,284 --> 2:12:31,248
Him didn't want us
to see him in that state.


2099
2:12:31,248 --> 2:12:34,835
Bob had a stroke,
I think, on the left side.


2100
2:12:34,835 --> 2:12:39,548
So he was frustrated
he couldn't finger a guitar.


2101
2:12:39,548 --> 2:12:42,468
 So when you left him,
you thought he might get better?


2102
2:12:42,468 --> 2:12:44,678
- Yeah.
I was definitely hoping...


2103
2:12:44,678 --> 2:12:48,265
Well, he was trying to tell me that...
that he's gonna beat this thing.


2104
2:12:48,265 --> 2:12:49,933
You know?


2105
2:12:49,933 --> 2:12:53,353
Gonna beat this thing.


2106
2:12:53,353 --> 2:13:17,169



2107
2:13:17,169 --> 2:13:34,686



2108
2:13:34,686 --> 2:13:38,19
 I think people then started
going after his wealth.


2109
2:13:38,19 --> 2:13:41,235
I think that it was...
it had become...


2110
2:13:41,235 --> 2:13:44,279
a bloodthirsty-type situation,


2111
2:13:44,279 --> 2:13:48,33
where people knew he was gonna die,


2112
2:13:48,33 --> 2:13:55,582
and they was just...
they just surrounded him.


2113
2:13:55,582 --> 2:13:59,253
- That's why Bob never write a will,
I feel.


2114
2:13:59,253 --> 2:14:1,713
Bob will never want to give up.


2115
2:14:1,713 --> 2:14:4,7
It seems like when you write a will,
it's like you say,


2116
2:14:4,7 --> 2:14:9,221
"Well, you know, I'm checking in."


2117
2:14:9,221 --> 2:14:10,722
So I think that was
one of the reasons.


2118
2:14:10,722 --> 2:14:12,224
I think one of the reasons, too,


2119
2:14:12,224 --> 2:14:14,434
is he's not the type of person
who would say,


2120
2:14:14,434 --> 2:14:18,188
"Now, okay.
I leave this for Ziggy, Cedella."


2121
2:14:18,188 --> 2:14:21,984
You know, like, divide up.
And "Okay, what should I leave for Seeco...


2122
2:14:21,984 --> 2:14:25,153
and Neville and Carly and..."


2123
2:14:25,153 --> 2:14:27,72
That's not Bob.


2124
2:14:27,72 --> 2:14:30,45
Where the Bob I know,
by leaving it open like that,


2125
2:14:30,45 --> 2:14:34,371
everybody reveal
who they really were.


2126
2:14:34,371 --> 2:14:37,4
You get me?
- Hmm.


2127
2:14:37,4 --> 2:14:40,335
- Who really did love him,
who fighting over the money.


2128
2:14:40,335 --> 2:14:48,218
Yeah, man. Him does say,
but that's how he is. Bob left it open.


2129
2:14:48,218 --> 2:14:53,223
 The doctor said that
he couldn't do anything more for Bob,


2130
2:14:53,223 --> 2:14:54,933
and if we were going to leave,


2131
2:14:54,933 --> 2:14:59,271
we'd have to do it within 48 hours.


2132
2:14:59,271 --> 2:15:3,734
- So I said, "I'm on my way back.
I'm coming back to Germany this week."


2133
2:15:3,734 --> 2:15:6,194
And he said, "No, don't come."


2134
2:15:6,194 --> 2:15:8,3
He's coming to Miami.


2135
2:15:8,3 --> 2:15:10,866
- We decided, you know, that...


2136
2:15:10,866 --> 2:15:15,78
we'd just rent a plane, you know.


2137
2:15:15,78 --> 2:15:17,372
Bob wanted to know if it's a Concorde.


2138
2:15:17,372 --> 2:15:20,167
I said, "No.


2139
2:15:20,167 --> 2:15:34,389
No Concorde."


2140
2:15:34,389 --> 2:15:37,643
 So I brought up all the kids
from... who was in Jamaica.


2141
2:15:37,643 --> 2:15:41,73
Some of them my kids.
Some from other mothers.


2142
2:15:41,73 --> 2:15:44,983
So I gathered everyone and said,
"Come. Daddy want to see you all."


2143
2:15:44,983 --> 2:15:48,195
- I remember me and Ziggy
were sitting outside,


2144
2:15:48,195 --> 2:15:51,406
and some preacher guy
came from Jamaica,


2145
2:15:51,406 --> 2:15:55,118
another one came from
the Ethiopian Church,


2146
2:15:55,118 --> 2:15:58,33
and I'm telling Ziggy, "Ziggy,
he's gonna be all right, you know?


2147
2:15:58,33 --> 2:16:0,707
'Cause, I mean, look...
look how many people are praying."


2148
2:16:0,707 --> 2:16:5,253
- My memory was going to
the intensive care unit,


2149
2:16:5,253 --> 2:16:7,214
doing "peep," going like this,


2150
2:16:7,214 --> 2:16:10,509
looking through the window,
you know, like, going...


2151
2:16:10,509 --> 2:16:13,512
And him lay down there,
and him kind of see me, and him go...


2152
2:16:13,512 --> 2:16:15,472
him go, "Come."


2153
2:16:15,472 --> 2:16:19,434
So I went in, I went beside him,
and him say, you know,


2154
2:16:19,434 --> 2:16:22,896
"What up, young Bob?"
You know, "What's up, young Bob?"


2155
2:16:22,896 --> 2:16:26,233
And, um, "I've a song for you."


2156
2:16:26,233 --> 2:16:29,152
You know, him say,
"I have a song for you."


2157
2:16:29,152 --> 2:16:31,613
And him... him sing a couple
of lines of the song,


2158
2:16:31,613 --> 2:16:37,77
"On your way up, take me up.
On your way down, don't let me down."


2159
2:16:37,77 --> 2:16:40,414
- You know, like the one time
you're kinda hoping...


2160
2:16:40,414 --> 2:16:46,44
you can have him for yourself...


2161
2:16:46,44 --> 2:16:48,505



2162
2:16:48,505 --> 2:17:6,69
And it wasn't supposed
to happen again, you know?


2163
2:17:6,69 --> 2:17:10,36
Haile Selassie


2164
2:17:10,36 --> 2:17:18,452
Is the chapel


2165
2:17:18,452 --> 2:17:28,336



2166
2:17:28,336 --> 2:17:37,596
Power of the Trinity


2167
2:17:37,596 --> 2:17:40,474
Trinity


2168
2:17:40,474 --> 2:17:48,23
Trinity


2169
2:17:48,23 --> 2:17:50,942
Build your mind


2170
2:17:50,942 --> 2:17:56,281
On this direction


2171
2:17:56,281 --> 2:18:5,54



2172
2:18:5,54 --> 2:18:9,711
Serve the living God


2173
2:18:9,711 --> 2:18:13,757
And live


2174
2:18:13,757 --> 2:18:17,886
Livin' God
Livin' God


2175
2:18:17,886 --> 2:18:23,558
And live


2176
2:18:23,558 --> 2:18:27,145
Take your troubles


2177
2:18:27,145 --> 2:18:32,567
To Selassie


2178
2:18:32,567 --> 2:18:41,159



2179
2:18:41,159 --> 2:18:44,79
He is the only


2180
2:18:44,79 --> 2:18:49,376
King of Kings


2181
2:18:49,376 --> 2:18:52,87
King of Kings


2182
2:18:52,87 --> 2:18:59,94
King of Kings is he


2183
2:18:59,94 --> 2:19:3,98
Conquering lion


2184
2:19:3,98 --> 2:19:7,936
Of Judah


2185
2:19:7,936 --> 2:19:16,278



2186
2:19:16,278 --> 2:19:19,155
Triumphantly


2187
2:19:19,155 --> 2:19:24,536
We all must sing


2188
2:19:24,536 --> 2:19:27,539
All must sing


2189
2:19:27,539 --> 2:19:32,335
All must sing


2190
2:19:32,335 --> 2:19:39,509
I search and I search


2191
2:19:39,509 --> 2:19:45,98
Splendid book of man


2192
2:19:45,98 --> 2:19:51,354
In the Revelations


2193
2:19:51,354 --> 2:19:57,527
Look what I find


2194
2:19:57,527 --> 2:20:0,739
Haile Selassie


2195
2:20:0,739 --> 2:20:6,244
Is the chapel


2196
2:20:6,244 --> 2:20:10,498



2197
2:20:10,498 --> 2:20:28,141



2198
2:20:28,141 --> 2:20:30,602



2199
2:20:30,602 --> 2:20:42,489



2200
2:20:42,489 --> 2:20:45,2
Get up stand up


2201
2:20:45,2 --> 2:20:47,994
Stand up for your right


2202
2:20:47,994 --> 2:20:50,83
Get up stand up


2203
2:20:50,83 --> 2:20:54,292
Don't give up the fight


2204
2:20:54,292 --> 2:20:57,462
Get up stand up
Get up stand up now


2205
2:20:57,462 --> 2:21:0,298
Stand up for your rights
Ooh-ooh


2206
2:21:0,298 --> 2:21:2,968
Get up stand up
Get up stand up now


2207
2:21:2,968 --> 2:21:7,55
Don't give up the fight


2208
2:21:7,55 --> 2:21:10,58
Get up stand up
Oh whoa whoa whoa


2209
2:21:10,58 --> 2:21:13,144
Stand up for your right
One more time


2210
2:21:13,144 --> 2:21:15,647
 Get up stand up


2211
2:21:15,647 --> 2:21:18,566
Don't give up the fight


2212
2:21:18,566 --> 2:21:21,945
Don't give up the fight


2213
2:21:21,945 --> 2:21:24,531
Don't give up the fight


2214
2:21:24,531 --> 2:21:27,2
Don't give up the fight
Why


2215
2:21:27,2 --> 2:21:29,869
'Cause I never give up the fight


2216
2:21:29,869 --> 2:21:32,372
'Cause I never give up the fight


2217
2:21:32,372 --> 2:21:37,127
'Cause I never give up the fight


2218
2:21:37,127 --> 2:21:39,379
'Cause I never give up the fight


2219
2:21:39,379 --> 2:21:41,548
Don't give up the fight

Don't give up the fight

Children don't give up the fight

2:21:46,803 --> 2:21:48,179
Jah Jah children


2223
2:21:48,179 --> 2:21:51,182
Don't give up the fight

2:21:51,182 --> 2:21:54,185
One love


2225
2:21:54,185 --> 2:21:56,896
One heart


2226
2:21:56,896 --> 2:22:3,69
Let's get together and feel all right


2227
2:22:3,69 --> 2:22:7,949
Hear the children crying
One love


2228
2:22:7,949 --> 2:22:9,909
One heart

And I will feel all right


2231

Let's get together and feel all right

Whoa yo-yo-yo

2:22:23,506 --> 2:22:27,635
 Let them all pass
all their dirty remarks


2235
2:22:27,635 --> 2:22:30,13
One love


2236
2:22:30,13 --> 2:22:34,392
There is one question
I'd really love to ask


2237
2:22:34,392 --> 2:22:36,102
One heart


2238
2:22:36,102 --> 2:22:37,729
Is there a place


2239
2:22:37,729 --> 2:22:40,982
For the hopeless sinner


2240
2:22:40,982 --> 2:22:44,194
Who has hurt all mankind


2241
2:22:44,194 --> 2:22:46,78
Just to save his own


2242
2:22:46,78 --> 2:22:48,239
Believe me


2243
2:22:48,239 --> 2:22:51,618
One love
What about one

So shall it be in the end
One heart

All right
