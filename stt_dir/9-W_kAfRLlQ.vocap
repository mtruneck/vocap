###18 SUROOSH ALVI: We're in Islamabad,
###20 the capital of Pakistan.
###22 We're just two hours south of Abbottabad, where Osama bin
###25 Laden was killed recently.
###27 And we wanted to see what life was like here post Osama bin
###30 Laden, how people are reacting to the fact that he was living
###33 here for five years.
###35 [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING]
###39 PRESIDENT OBAMA (OFFSCREEN): Tonight, I can report to the
###42 American people and to the world that the United States
###45 has conducted an operation that killed Osama bin Laden,
###48 the leader of al-Qaeda and the terrorist who's responsible
###52 for the murder of thousands of innocent
###55 men, women, and children.
###58 And on nights like this one, we can say to those families
###61 who have lost loved ones to al-Qaeda's terror,
###65 justice has been done.

###90 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###96 SUROOSH ALVI: So we're on our way to Abbottabad right now.
###100 We're about 70 kilometers away.
###102 And it's an army place.
###105 The town itself, military
###106 garrisons, a huge army presence.
###109 It's considered to be the safest city in Pakistan, which
###113 is the irony of the fact that bin Laden was found there.
###116 What we've been told is that the house itself, bin Laden's
###119 compound, there is a perimeter of army guys around it.
###122 So we're going to try to get as close as we can to it.
###124 
###127 We'll see how much success we have.
###129 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###140 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###141 
###155 SUROOSH ALVI: So the police stopped us, and
###156 they turned us around.
###157 So we're going to try a different route.
###159 Go around the block and see if we can access the compound
###161 from another way.
###165 So we're walking around the back side now.
###168 See how far we can get.
###171 Probably not very far because there's guys with guns
###174 not far from us.
###176 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###177 
###218 SUROOSH ALVI: So this is kind of ridiculous.
###221 After bin Laden was killed, the compound was apparently
###225 open for a few days.
###226 The journalists were showing up, and people were picnicking
###228 around there.
###230 And now there's a perimeter of cops and army so you can't
###234 even get close to the house.
###236 We still managed to steal some shots anyway.
###238 But we wanted to find the guy who actually broke the story.
###242 His name is Abrar Rasheed.
###243 He lives in Abbottabad.
###244 And he works for a Pakistani Network, Geo Television.
###247 So you were basically one of the first
###249 reporters on the scene?
###251 ABRAR RASHEED: Yeah.
###252 I was the first reporter who was at the scene.
###256 And I am the first person who broke that story at that
###261 particular night.
###262 Although I didn't know who was the high-value target until
###266 and unless the President Obama claimed next morning.
###269 It was morning time Pakistan that Osama bin Laden was
###272 killed in Abbottabad.
###274 SUROOSH ALVI: So since I've arrived in Pakistan, I've
###276 heard a lot of people say that it was highly unlikely that
###279 bin Laden lived in that house in this town.
###282 What is your view on that?
###285 ABRAR RASHEED: To tell you frankly, still I am unable to
###289 believe that Osama bin Laden was here in the first place.
###292 Like so many other Pakistanis, it's very hard for me to
###297 believe that he was here.
###298 And especially the people of Abbottabad.
###300 I mean, if you go around and interview a common man on the
###303 street, and if you go around and interview certain
###307 officials, you know, businessmen, traders, or
###310 journalists, nobody would tell you that he believes that
###313 Osama bin Laden was here living in Abbottabad, which is
###316 a garrison town.
###318 And his compound was hardly a kilometer away from Pakistan's
###323 military academy.
###324 And I'm sure his family members were there, but Osama
###328 bin Laden wasn't there.
###330 I think it's a very mysterious kind of circumstances.
###333 And unfortunately, government of Pakistan, and Pakistani
###336 military authorities have added more into this mystery.
###343 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###348 SUROOSH ALVI: Zarar Amjad, there's an 11-year-old boy who
###350 lived across the street from the bin Laden compound.
###352 He was the boy who played cricket.
###354 And when his ball would go across over the wall into the
###357 compound, they wouldn't give him the ball back, but a man
###359 would give him 50 rupees.
###361 After May 2 when bin Laden was killed, he
###364 became a bit of a celebrity.
###367 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###368 
###373 Can you tell me about living across from the house?
###378 Did you see the people that lived inside?

###481 SUROOSH ALVI: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###482 ZARAR AMJAD: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###484 SUROOSH ALVI: He was saying, for five years I lived across
###487 the street from this house.
###488 I played with the kids in the compound.
###490 I went into the house.
###492 He said the kids spoke different languages.
###493 They spoke Arabic or Pashto.
###495 He saw one guy, Uncle Nadeem, who was the guy who took care
###499 of the wives in the compound.
###501 He would get all the supplies.
###503 He said he never saw a tall man that looked
###505 like Osama bin Laden.
###507 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###510 SUROOSH ALVI: We're on the campus of
###511 Ayub Medical College.
###512 We're going to walk around and try and find some students,
###514 see if they'll talk to us, give us some dirt.
###517 See if they're believing the hype, or if they think it's a
###520 conspiracy like everyone else in this country.

###532

###595 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###599 SUROOSH ALVI: If bin Laden lived here, and Pakistan knew,
###603 then Pakistan is a rogue state.
###607 If bin Laden lived here, and Pakistan didn't know, then
###611 Pakistan's a failed state.
###612 You know that's one way to look at it.
###615 The average Pakistani would probably not agree because
###618 most people are saying, how do we even know for
###621 sure that he was here?
###623 Where is the proof?
###624 Where was the body?
###625 And when you go to Abbottabad and you see the house where he
###629 lived, it's like really?
###631 He lived in there?
###632 That house Is a piece of shit.
###635 It doesn't change history.
###636 In the annals of history, Osama bin Laden died in
###639 Abbottabad on May 2, 2011.
###642 And that's fine.
###643 Ultimately, bin Laden was dead.
###644 That's all that matters.
###646 But that's just bin Laden.
###648 This country as a whole is having some serious
###652 problems right now.
###653 Since May 2, the number of drone attacks have escalated.
###658 There seems to be something happening every day.
###660 And also the response from the Taliban has increased.
###664 There are suicide bombers attacking everywhere, all over
###668 the country.
###670 We are back in Peshawar.
###672 And we are on our way to a bomb site, a suicide bomb
###677 attacked the police station.
###679 Every day there's something that's happening in Peshawar.
###681 The terrorists are definitely stirring up the pot.
###683 [SIRENS SOUNDING]
###688 
###691 SUROOSH ALVI: Yesterday, the Pakistani Taliban, the TTP,
###694 they sent a suicide bomber in to the CID.
###697 It's the crime and investigation department.
###700 This happened yesterday morning.
###702 Eight people died.
###703 And they were avenging May 2, Osama bin Laden assassination.
###709 They pulled out two police officers from the basement who
###712 were still alive.
###714 And they're looking for bodies and trying to clear the
###718 wreckage right now.
###721 ABRAR RASHEED: Since 9/11, at least 35,000 people lost their
###728 lives in this so-called war against terror.
###731 And being American ally in this war, 5,300 military
###738 personnel lost their life.
###740 $68 billion to $69 billion, Pakistan suffered this loss.
###745 And against that amount, Pakistan got $20 billion, out
###750 of which I think $13 billion were paid to the Pakistan
###754 military and $7-8 billion to the civilian government.
###759 Pakistan has sacrificed a lot, and in return,
###762 what we have got?
###765 Humiliation, taunts, and demands of do more, do more.
###773 Americans and the Western world should realize
###776 Pakistan's sacrifices.
###777 And now they should be aware of another thing, that there
###782 are very, very strong anti-American
###785 sentiments in Pakistan.
###787 Not only in the general public, not only in the common
###790 masses, but now even in the media.
###793 Even no political leaders, even the popular political
###796 parties can't publicly praise America anymore.
###800 Because they know that they can face the backlash.
###803 
###806 SUROOSH ALVI: There's another smaller bomb site.
###808 A convoy of cars from the US consulate drove by
###811 here a few days ago.
###812 And there was a car situated right here.
###815 It exploded when the Americans drove by.
###818 It was a Taliban attack.
###820 And yet another example of how the Osama bin Laden
###825 assassination has affected this country.
###827 Now we have to try and track down someone from the Taliban,
###830 get on the phone with these fucking assholes and find out
###832 what they're thinking.
###833 I'd been trying to interview the Taliban for over six
###835 months but had no luck in tracking them down.
###838 On this trip I met two journalists
###840 for the tribal areas.
###841 The kind of guys that the Taliban call after a suicide
###843 bomb to claim responsibility.
###845 I wrote down some questions for them to ask on my behalf.
###848 Well, I would love to get on the phone with the Taliban.
###850 Can we try to call them and see if we could speak to them?
###854 RAFITULLAH ORAKZAI: We can see.
###855 We'll check if there is any possibility.
###858 SUROOSH ALVI: OK.
###858 Thank you very much.
###859 
###862 We were trying to call the spokesperson for the Taliban
###864 on the land line from the office.
###866 We were getting a busy signal.
###867 Then two minutes after that, the other guy's cell phone
###870 rings, and it's him.

###965 SUROOSH ALVI: According to the spokesperson for the Pakistani
###967 Taliban, their party line is that they're only after
###970 government institutions.
###971 But the reality is very different.
###973 In the communities, people have been terrorized,
###976 kidnapped, and killed by the Taliban.
###978 And because the army and the police have failed to help
###981 these people, a lot of them have formed their own militias
###984 called lashkars.
###984 And they've taken matters into their own hands.
###987 
###989 I'm standing outside of Faheem Khan's place.
###991 He's the head of the lashkar, which is a militia that
###995 protects the neighborhood, the village, and the
###997 people that live here.
###998 We're right on the edge of the Khyber tribal agency.
###1002 And these guys had to pick up arms when the government and
###1004 the police failed to beat the Taliban down.
###1007 He's agreed to meet us.
###1008 He normally doesn't do interviews with anyone.
###1009 So we're going to go in.

###1106 
###1111 SUROOSH ALVI: They basically are saying, we don't want to
###1113 live the life that the Taliban wants to force on us.
###1116 And they're protecting themselves, and they're doing
###1120 a good job.
###1121 I like them.
###1122 They're a good vibe.
###1124 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1125 FAHEEM KHAN: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1128 SUROOSH ALVI: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1131 Pakistan is in a very, very critical time
###1135 period right now.
###1138 Probably the most dangerous and unstable time in its short
###1142 history as a country.
###1144 As we saw, you have the lashkars, who've picked up
###1147 arms and are fighting the Taliban.
###1149 Then there's the Taliban and the 30 splinter groups within
###1152 it, who are attacking police stations and government
###1154 offices with suicide bombers and bomb blasts
###1156 all over the country.
###1158 And then there's the Americans who are sending in drone
###1160 planes to target the militants in the tribal areas.
###1163 This multi-front battle is playing out in real time in
###1166 the media which has exploded in Pakistan
###1168 in the last 10 years.
###1169 Right now there's almost 70 TV channels.
###1171 And 26 of them broadcast news 24 hours a day.
###1175 It feels like the entire population of the country are
###1177 news junkies with a morbid fascination for all the bad
###1180 events happening in Pakistan right now.
###1182 
###1187 The first time we came to this region was in 2006 when we
###1191 shot a documentary called The Gun Markets of Pakistan in a
###1193 town called Dara Adamkhel.
###1195 At the time, it was the largest illegal gun
###1198 market in the world.
###1198 [GUNSHOTS]
###1202 SUROOSH ALVI: It was one of the very first things that
###1204 Vice ever filmed.
###1205 We tried to go back when we filmed the follow-up to it
###1207 called The Taliban in Pakistan, but it was
###1209 impossible at that time.
###1211 Just four kilometers that way is the gun market where we
###1214 filmed four years ago.
###1216 That area has been taken over by the Taliban.
###1219 So before we left the country on this trip, we wanted to
###1221 give it another try to see what the impact of the Taliban
###1224 has been on this town.
###1226 Taliban are still coming in.
###1228 They're still fighting them.
###1230 But my driver, Muhammad Khan, he's from there originally.
###1233 So he is going to get us in.
###1235 We're going to do a quick drive-by and see what it looks
###1237 like in there.
###1238 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###1246 SUROOSH ALVI: We're going into the Dara Adamkhel bazaar.
###1249 So let's see what we find.
###1251 
###1256 A bomb blast there?
###1257 MALE SPEAKER: Yes.
###1259 
###1266 SUROOSH ALVI: It's very, very different than it used to be.
###1270 A few shops open and garbage strewn everywhere.
###1280 80% of the shops are closed.
###1285 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1286 
###1317 SUROOSH ALVI: It's creepy and spooky here.
###1319 So we're going to get the hell out of this town.
###1323 This is the end of six years of covering this place.
###1328 And, you know, it's a microcosm of
###1332 Pakistan as a whole.
###1333 You could take any place in the city, in Karachi, Lahore,
###1337 Islamabad, Peshawar, or you could take the Dara Adamkhel
###1341 market, and you see the decline.
###1343 And this is a small example of the
###1346 disintegration of this country.
###1348 And I hope that it's going to hit bottom soon, because after
###1350 that the only place to go is up.
###1354 It's pretty bleak.
