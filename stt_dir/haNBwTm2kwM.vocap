###33 THOMAS MORTON: OK.
###35 
###39 THOMAS MORTON: Let's fall back on our
###41 survival training from--
###43 DON WHITE: I'll see you all out in the field somewhere.
###46 THOMAS MORTON: All right, thank you sir.
###46 DON WHITE: Good luck guys.
###48 THOMAS MORTON: OK, so, let's just cross real low.
###53 
###96 THOMAS MORTON: Maybe we should just make a
###97 fucking run for it.
###100 What we hope right now is that the Americans still control
###103 the fire base, and that we can hole up there
###106 for a little bit.
###109 Should we yell, don't shoot, reporters?
###111 I'm kind of holding my hands out in a surrender gesture,
###114 which I figure is definitely in keeping with the kind of
###117 craven in nature of the role I've chosen for myself.
###123 Maybe if we report a little louder they can hear our
###125 voices, and I'll call out--
###126 [GUN SHOTS]
###126 THOMAS MORTON: Whoa!
###127 Don't shoot!
###128 Reporters!
###130 Lets go this way.
###132 
###135 Well, this is definitely the base.
###137 NARRATOR: The fire base was still under American control,
###140 but barely.
###140 The infantry unit had been whittled down to a skeleton
###144 crew of one GI, and the only girl we'd seen without
###147 a rice paddy hat.
###148 
###152 THOMAS MORTON: Were you the one who shot at us.
###153 ANNA TOMIC: Yes.
###154 THOMAS MORTON: OK, that's all right.
###155 I would have done it to.
###156 
###174 DON WHITE: There's a leg infantry unit
###177 working its way up here.
###178 
###181 DON WHITE: That's another American unit working their
###182 way up here.
###182 They should be coming from that direction.
###184 ANNA TOMIC: OK.
###185 
###224 |
###225 THOMAS MORTON: So the soldiers we were waiting on the
###226 infantry division just rolled up cool as day.
###230 BILL BURGESS: There's another patrol out there.
###231 This place is infested.
###232 
###235 BILL BURGESS: I'm 4th ID, 4th Infantry.
###239 THOMAS MORTON: What occurred to your unit tonight?
###240 BILL BURGESS: Well, think mainly what we've
###242 got is light VC probe.
###246 They're just trying to find out how many we've got in
###248 here, and how many are holding the position.
###250 THOMAS MORTON: Does this happen often?
###252 BILL BURGESS: Every night, yeah Charlie owns the night.
###256 All we can do is hunker down and try to keep the body count
###263 to a minimum.
###264 What's going on back in the world?
###268 THOMAS MORTON: Not much, there's a new Doors album
###270 that's pretty decent if you like that kind of stuff.
###274 How was Korea compared to here?
###276 BILL BURGESS: The same, fighting communism, the
###283 insidious evil, love to travel to distant lands and meet
###289 exotic people and kill them.
###293 THOMAS MORTON: Well thank you soldier.
###294 I hope this goes well.
###295 
###298 Excuse me, we're looking for a Sergeant Wilkes.
###299 SERGEANT WILKES: That would be me.
###300 THOMAS MORTON: Is there going to be another patrol tonight?
###303 SERGEANT WILKES: We're going to do what's called a RON,
###304 remain over night.
###305 We're basically going to go find a spot, a hiding hole,
###309 and hide, and lay out in the field all night.
###311 THOMAS MORTON: Could we accompany you on this patrol?
###314 SERGEANT WILKES: Are you gonna talk?
###315 THOMAS MORTON: Huh?
###316 SERGEANT WILKES: Are you gonna talk?
###317 THOMAS MORTON: Can I talk?
###318 SERGEANT WILKES: No.
###319 THOMAS MORTON: Can I whisper?
###320 SERGEANT WILKES: No.
###320 THOMAS MORTON: So there's no talking whatsoever?
###321 SERGEANT WILKES: When we leave here there won't be a single
###322 word, except for a radio check every hour.
###325 
###328 [ROCKET LAUNCHING]
###329 -That's a rocket!
###330 [EXPLOSIONS]
###331 [GUN SHOTS]
###336 THOMAS MORTON: So VC right at the perimeter of the base.
###340 There's rockets on the other side too.
###342 [GUN SHOTS]
###345 -It's a fire [INAUDIBLE].
###346 
###350 THOMAS MORTON: Charlie's fucking everywhere.
###353 Our fire base is under attack.
###355 -Come on you fucking gooks!
###358 [GUN SHOTS]
###366 THOMAS MORTON: This fox hole right here.
###368 [GUN SHOTS]
###370 THOMAS MORTON: It's kind of weird because you struggle to,
###373 like, remember to keep in character, and to, like, make
###377 sure you pretend it's 1968.
###379 And then when the actual fire fight happens it's as if it is
###382 1968
###387 -Get down on your knees.
###389 Down.
###390 THOMAS MORTON: So we've basically been under fire for
###391 the last 30 minutes.
###393 And I've kind of had this suspicion it was four dudes.
###396 We just killed two of them and then captured two.
###398 And the fire fight has stopped.
###400 Let's see what happens to them.
###402 SERGEANT WILKES: The skinny one's a smart ass.
###404 BILL BURGESS: Oh yeah?
###405 SERGEANT WILKES: Yeah, he's definitely a troublemaker.
###409 And the other one looks like he'll talk.
###412 BILL BURGESS: Well, do it the old way.
###415 Just rub a butt out on their nut.
###416 They'll tell you how their mama wipes their ass.
###418 -How many of there are you?
###419 -Two squads?
###421 -Two squads of four?
###422 Two squads of 12?
###425 Two squads of what?
###426 -VC [INAUDIBLE].
###427 -Look, fuck with me once, I kill you.
###429 BILL BURGESS: OK, I guess it's time to get
###431 something going here.
###433 Here, take this.
###435 All right you little shit.
###436 You going to start telling me something.
###438 Want a cigarette?
###440 [SCREAMING]
###443 BILL BURGESS: Talk to me!
###445 THOMAS MORTON: One other thing that's tricky about Vietnam,
###448 is to make the war accurate, you have to
###449 make the racism accurate.
###451 This may be true for other wars, but Kraut and Jerry just
###454 don't carry the same weight these days as
###456 gook and slant eye.
###458 BILL BURGESS: You been around.
###459 You speak English.
###460 You want another cigarette?
###461 -Fuck a you, GI!
###462 BILL BURGESS: How about you ear there.
###463 How about that?
###464 [SCREAMING]
###465 THOMAS MORTON: It's a little bit grizzly.
###469 It looks like two VC soldiers are coming out of the grass.
###472 Holy shit, no, it's like four or five, God.
###476 NARRATOR: Actually, this ties back to a much larger Nam
###478 problem, of whether or not to re-enact soldier misconduct.
###483 Nobody behaves exceptionally well in war.
###485 That's the point.
###486 But while it's natural to let the heroics of, say, Antietam
###489 or the Battle of the Bulge take center stage over the
###492 concurrent rapes and field burnings.
###494 The public impression of the Vietnam War is colored by
###496 things like my Malai and the Zippo Raids, not exactly the
###500 US Army's proudest moments.
###502 
###504 BILL BURGESS: Grab another one of those grunts over there.
###506 Tell him to come over here and stand on
###508 this side with a rifle.
###510 This mama-san here's got NVA equipment on.
###515 THOMAS MORTON: What's going to happen
###516 with all these prisoners?
###518 SERGEANT WILKES: Well, if they make a push on it, they become
###521 a liability to us.
###522 So we're going to whack them.
###526 -Speak Vietnamese?
###527 -Speak English?
###528 Speak English?
###529 Speak French?
###531 THOMAS MORTON: Why did you guys all surrender?
###534 -No ammo.
###536 THOMAS MORTON: Oh, you ran out of ammunition.
###539 SERGEANT WILKES: Time for you to go now.
###540 Really sorry, it's been fun.
###542 Get up.
###544 This is where bad things happen.
###548 Turn around.
###548 Turn around.
###549 
###552 BILL BURGESS: I ain't got time for no courtroom out here.
###554 [GUN SHOT]
###557 BILL BURGESS: You've still got your little friends out there
###558 popping at us from the damn trees.
###560 You're going to tell me something.
###561 I want something.
###562 Give me something.
###564 All right, that's fine.
###567 You got exactly 60 seconds to let me know something.
###572 If not, I'm going to give you a little
###573 taste of American steel.
###575 
###581 THOMAS MORTON: We've got a lot of prisoners
###582 kind of lined up here.
###583 They've been sort of taunting them for a little while.
###586 And now appear to be ready to execute them,
###589 summarily, which does not--
###591 not really in fitting with, like, the best of image of US
###595 soldiers in Vietnam.
###598 BILL BURGESS: Cut the camera off.
###601 Cut the camera off.
###601 THOMAS MORTON: Why do we need to cut the camera off?
###603 BILL BURGESS: Cut the camera off?
###604 THOMAS MORTON: Why do we need to cut the camera off?
###605 We're here of our own volition.
###608 We're Americans trying to cover this war.
###612 Keep rolling.
###613 
###618 -I tell you what.
###618 You see this?
###619 How about this?
###620 [GUN SHOT]
###621 -Next!
###623 -Anybody want to say anything?
###625 THOMAS MORTON: Did they just murder someone?
###627 [GUN SHOTS]
###629 THOMAS MORTON: The soldiers we've been with this whole
###630 time are summarily executing their VC.
###633 Excuse me, excuse me, we're filming.
###636 -Ah!
###637 We asked to turn the camera off.
###640 THOMAS MORTON: What's going on here?
###641 Shouldn't these people be turned over to army
###643 intelligence?
###644 -They are being turned over to army intelligence.
###646 THOMAS MORTON: How do you figure?
###648 -See, we've got this nice piece of intelligence right
###649 here-- this SKS.
###651 That's all the Army needs to see.
###655 THOMAS MORTON: Wouldn't these prisoners be more valuable to
###657 the army alive?
###658 -I don't see any prisoners.
###659 I just see NVA shooting at us.
###664 THOMAS MORTON: Do you worry about the effect that these
###666 images will have on the broadcast back to America?
###670 -I think we're doing everything we
###672 need to over here.
###673 Doing good work over here.
###674 -Good night, sweeties.
###674 Did you see all those fucking gooks trying
###676 to get up and leave?
###677 Wow, just running out of here.
###680 
###683 THOMAS MORTON: So we just witnessed a war crime.
###685 You can see there are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, VC
###697 soldiers who had surrendered.
###701 Or just-- no, I'm sorry, 12, summarily executed by American
###710 soldiers out here in the field with an
###713 utter sense of impunity.
###716 Kind of not a great look for the American Army, you know?
###720 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###729 THOMAS MORTON: I'm trying to unpack everything we've just
###731 been through in the last day.
###733 I feel like the reenactment may have been effective in
###736 really blurring the lines between doing this for play
###740 and trying to fully recreate the historical reality of Nam.
###746 On the one hand, it's a hobby, a way to hang out your buddies
###749 and have a good weekend.
###751 On the other hand, the whole point of that hobby is to
###753 immerse yourself in the most awful experience most men will
###755 ever live through, which kind of hits home at the
###759 fundamental paradox of war itself.
###761 That is to say, in the words of William Tecumseh
###764 Sherman, it's hell.
###766 Although, in the words of Spacemen Three, I think I'll
###769 be in good company down there with all my friends.
###772 All this reporter knows is that the things I've seen here
###775 will stay with me until the end of my days, and forever
###778 haunt my dreams.
###780 From Vietnam in North Carolina, it's Thomas Morton
###783 signing off.
