###24 JAKE BURGHART: Starting to have a bit of a breakdown.
###26 Let's see.
###27 I'm going to take this tape out, put it in my pocket after
###31 I shoot it, and--
###33 I don't even know why I'm shooting it right now.
###35 It's sort of a--
###38 I just kind of really need someone to talk to.
###42 I don't know where to start.
###44 I came into this trip with a--
###46 really excited about it.
###48 Just nothing more than getting to be on the
###50 ocean for three weeks.
###52 Now I don't have any idea what's going on.
###55 I can't sleep at night.
###56 I'm, like, feeling sick, feeling really sort of trapped
###62 on this boat.
###63 There's nowhere to go.
###64 It's a 50-foot boat, you know?
###66 It's like, if you want to take a walk around the block, it
###68 doesn't happen.
###70 You want to like run or do anything to sort of forget
###74 about what's going on, and it's just not there.
###76 We're all here, all on this boat.
###80 There's no getting away from each other.
###81 
###84 We have two watches a day, and I don't think I've slept in
###87 three days.
###88 
###95 This is my first time I've ever gone night diving, or
###100 diving in the ocean, or diving this far away from anything,
###107 or diving with a camera, or diving with a knife, or diving
###112 with a captain.
###114 
###117 MEREDITH DANLUCK: It was like going into outer space.
###119 
###127 Like, the point of something being so crazy and scary that
###133 it's really fun.
###135 [LAUGHING]
###154 THOMAS MORTON: Jake and Meredith are under
###155 the boat right now.
###157 I'm still on watch, apparently, which I guess was
###162 never factored into the schedule.
###165 I puked pretty ferociously at around eight or so, and then
###169 had kind of a long drying off spell where I probably would
###175 have preferred to get a little bit of sleep.
###178 JAKE BURGHART: That was pretty insane.
###179 
###182 [LAUGHING]
###184 CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE: All right.
###185 This was quite a wonderful test.
###187 I'm quite pleased.
###188 The creatures you saw tonight will pale by comparison.
###191 
###195 THOMAS MORTON: So watch just ended.
###199 It gets really, really boring up there with absolutely
###204 nothing going on.
###206 So I'm going to make my own little log entry here, and
###211 then call it a night.
###215 Good luck with your watch.
###218 JAKE BURGHART: So once every hour, we have to do the log
###222 and check the engine rooms to make sure that they're not
###224 flooded with water.
###226 Before you know it, it's 3:00.
###228 It's time for your second log and engine check.
###230 From there it gets really slow.
###234 This made us all kind of start doing really nerdy things.
###239 I'm wearing a turtleneck and learning about the stars.
###241 
###250 Oh shit, I think I just deleted the course.
###253 MEREDITH DANLUCK: What?
###255 JAKE BURGHART: I think I just deleted the whole course.
###257 I was just--
###258 I was just clicking on these things, and I don't know.
###261 The whole course disappeared.
###262 There's no Undo.
###263 This program is stupid.
###266 Fuck.
###268 Goddamn it.
###270 Captain, we're going off course.
###271 
###275 We're dropping below 190.
###280 MEREDITH DANLUCK: [LAUGHING]
###284 THOMAS MORTON: No, you shouldn't have done that.
###288 You should have put a sad face there, perhaps.
###294 
###334 So it is day five.
###337 I'm on watch with Joe now, and we are working out.
###342 That's right, keep our strength up.
###346 Kind of realized this, uh, this boat's almost like--
###352 it's like being in prison but without, like--
###354 I don't know-- like the punishment and the
###356 gang rape and all.
###358 You don't have shit to do.
###360 You can either read, or as we decided, you
###363 can try to work out.
###365 Shit, fuck.
###366 Here they come.
###367 Oh, man.
###368 This is fucking exciting.
###369 
###371 Dolphins.
###374 [SINGING]
###374 Dolphin party, USA.
###376 Dolphin party, coming here to play with dolphins.
###379 Jesus Christ, there's, like, 20.
###382 They're still coming from the distance.
###383 [LAUGHING]
###385 There are so many fucking dolphins.
###386 
###390 Dude.
###392 This is great.
###392 You get so bored out here.
###394 And then all of a sudden, you got fucking
###396 dolphins and trash.
###397 It's amazing.
###399 Like, this is the highlight of our day.
###402 It's kind of getting ominous out here.
###404 For the past, like, two or three days, we've been kind of
###406 occasionally seeing shit and kind of picking and choosing
###408 what we want to pull out.
###410 I'm still holding out hope for, like, half a kewpie doll
###414 with, like, a fish coming out of its other arm.
###419 MEREDITH DANLUCK: Hey, what's going on?
###420 
###424 JAKE BURGHART: Probably kelp.
###426 
###435 JOE: Good show then, mate.
###437 You see the other two that came close?
###440 Right there, look at that.
###442 THOMAS MORTON: So what are you doing there?
###443 Are you severing its gills?
###445 JOE: Yes, its gill.
###446 It's a gill artery.
###447 THOMAS MORTON: OK, yeah.
###448 So you're cutting that so it'll bleed out the right way.
###453 I'm kind of glad I was on watch for that.
###455 I'm not too squeamish, but I just don't like fish when
###458 they're put together.
###460 So it's kind of a double doozy when they're coming apart, or
###464 when you're taking them apart.
###467 [LAUGHING NERVOUSLY]
###470 He was saying we're safer to eat smaller fish, even when
###472 we're out towards the gyre.
###474 They've had less time to accumulate all the toxins in
###477 their system, so--
###478 
###487 I feel kind of bad that we've been eating fish that have
###489 been swimming in this fucking water.
###492 I don't even want to think of all the--
###494 just looking at the big particles--
###495 all the shit we're probably ingesting.
###498 But at this point, I'm sure it's too late.
###500 CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE: These compounds are lypophilic,
###502 meaning fat loving.
###504 So they stick in fat.
###506 A million plankton, a thousand sardines, a hundred mackerel,
###511 eaten by, say, a mahi-mahi or a tuna.
###515 And then the higher cetaceans, they accumulate this whole
###520 chain of accumulation of these chemicals.
###525 Polycarbonate has Bisphenol-A in it, which leaches into the
###528 water and can cause reproductive
###530 harm and other defects.
###533 For instance, one out of four male swordfish in the
###536 Mediterranean are producing female egg yolk hormone that
###539 you wouldn't expect a male fish to make.
###541 THOMAS MORTON: It's screwing with their genetics.
###543 CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE: It's screwing with their genetics.
###544 So that's an indication of disruption of the hormone
###548 system, probably caused by industrial chemicals.
###551 I mean, we're starting to see problems like when we talk
###555 about how the Eskimo women have toxic milk for their
###558 babies and are being asked to use formula instead to feed
###561 their babies.
###561 THOMAS MORTON: Are they particularly
###562 susceptible to them?
###563 CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE: Yeah, because they eat high off the
###565 food chain.
###565 They eat marine mammals that have high fat content when
###570 this stuff is stored in the fat.
###573 And they're producing fewer males and smaller males.
###578 It's conceivable that there could be population crashes in
###582 many sexually reproducing species that loses its males.
###585 
###592 JAKE BURGHART: Was that your first swim?
###594 THOMAS MORTON: Ever, in the ocean.
###597 It's as terrifying as I fucking thought.
###600 
###612 MEREDITH DANLUCK: What?
###614 THOMAS MORTON: Getting out of the water, there was a little
###616 chunk of, like, yellow debris that was kind of caught on the
###621 corner of my lip.
###622 And then later, Jake got out of the water, and it just
###624 like-- it looked like he had body glitter on part of him.
###627 There was just little particulate waste.
###631 I've been like eating shit with my hands all day, too.
###634 There's fucking plastic in my mouth.
###637 I guess I can properly empathize with the fish and
###641 filter feeders now.
###642 But still, that's fucking gross.
###646 I was in the water for all of, like, 10 minutes with a
###650 snorkel in my mouth.
###650 And somehow a piece of plastic fucking worked its way in.
###653 
###676 I don't think we ever showed--
###679 we ever did a little tour of the boat.
###682 This is where all of us have pissed and shit.
###686 What happens when you use it is it is empty.
###694 It's basically, you fill it up with water, or if you're
###696 peeing, you just fill it with that.
###699 And then you stand here with your face about--
###702 what, a foot and a half--
###703 from your own fucking excrement.
###705 The best part is when the boat's rocking and things
###709 start to slosh around.
###712 This is also our shower, too.
###713 
###716 A lot of stuff gets done in this room.
###719 I don't know.
###720 There's been so much of that, like, this isn't cool to you,
###724 but I've been in a boat for seven days.
###726 And it's really neat that we can see a bird.
###728 MEREDITH DANLUCK: [LAUGHING]
###732 THOMAS MORTON: The days just kind of melt into
###733 the nights and shit.
###734 And it's just kind of like one big long hunk of walking
###737 around a boat and doing stuff.
###739 I don't know.
###740 It sounds like I'm retarded, but I've just never looked at
###743 the sky so much out of pure boredom.
###746 MEREDITH DANLUCK: [LAUGHING]
###748 Trash at starboard.
###749 You got it?
###751 That's good trash.
###753 What is it?
###756 Piece of something?
###758 MEREDITH DANLUCK: Looks like a flowerpot.
###760 JAKE BURGHART: There's a really big problem with
###761 flowerpots in the Pacific Ocean right now.
###765 So stop throwing them in here.
###769 THOMAS MORTON: Garbage island is less a physical place than
###771 really a state of mind.
###774 At some point, we all find our garbage island, whether it's
###777 out here in the Pacific or at home, comfortable, surrounded
###781 by people you care about and enjoy interacting with on a
###785 regular basis.
###786 CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE: I showed you--
###788 stop, stop, stop.
###790 JOE: Charlie.
###791 CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE: I gave you an example--
###792 JOE: Charlie.
###792 Charlie.
###792 Charlie.
###792 CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE: And you totally ignored it.
###794 JOE: Charlie.
###794 Charlie.
###795 Charlie.
###795 CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE: Don't tell me Charlie, Charlie,
###796 Charlie, Charlie.
###797 Then Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe.
###800 Joe, it's-- look, it's so easy--
###801 JOE: Hey, hey, hey, hey.
###802 CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE: Hey, you're making
###803 more trouble for yourself.
###804 You're cutting it smaller than it has to be.
###806 JOE: Hey, respect, Charlie.
###808 I've respected you.
###809 You need to respect me.
###811 CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE: Respect the way you're doing it wrong?
###813 JOE: If this isn't done right, then say
###814 something at the start.
###815 CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE: That's what I'm saying.
###816 JOE: You looked at me two minutes ago, and I
###817 was doing it fine.
###818 CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE: No, I didn't--
###819 JOE: No, you need to have respect.
###820 I'm respecting you as a man.
###822 CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE: [LAUGHING]
###822 JOE: Respect me, or we'll have further words.
###825 Do we understand ourselves?
###826 CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE: OK, I'm sorry.
###827 JOE: Thank you.
###828 Now how would you like it?
###829 CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE: Like this.
###830 Bigger.
###830 THOMAS MORTON: Want to go catch the sunset?
###832 
###835 Oh, my god.
###836 I am totally having a "Joe-berdose" as of today.
###841 I'm kind of lightening back up to it-- to the humor--
###844 the humor that is Joe.
###846 I don't know.
###847 I was having a bad--
###848 a bad time with it today.
###850 Just like, being around a guy who's living
###853 through the riff Holocaust.
###854 I've heard every statement
###857 I've made, basically--
###858 I wouldn't even limit it to jokes--
###861 repeated back to me.
###863 The one thing I will never grow tired of is his politics.
###868 He's one of those real just
###870 garden-variety California liberals.
###874 He's just like baffled by any other sort of worldview.
###877 He called 19th-century whalers idiots.
###880 [LAUGHING]
###885 We've gotten a little bit of a radio signal.
###888 We know the outside world still exists, basically.
###891 We don't have, like--
###893 we don't have any idea what exactly is going on there.
###898 I like these weird towers, or dicks--
###901 dicks of cloud.
###902 One thing that's been killing me, horniness.
###906 It's--
###909 first few days I was fine.
###910 But it's slowly waxing.
###912 I'm starting to, like, really fucking pore through the
###917 memory card up here in my--
###920 I'm not even trying to.
###921 I'm just catching myself in off hours.
###924 Our minds are just folding in on themselves.
###927 Oh, as far as trajectory, if this hand is California, and
###933 we started here in Long Beach, we kind of did this.
###935 And now we're plunking our way down into the gyre, which is
###939 right there.
###941 I think the current estimate is, like, two or three days,
###943 when we're right in the fucking thick of it.
###945 And then we can get down to business.
###946 It'll be good to get out to the patch because
###949 A, it'll give us--
###950 I mean, we'll be working out there, as opposed to just,
###953 like, sitting around and talking about
###955 how fast it's going.
###957 Also, it can serve as a scapegoat for any tension
###960 that's building up, you know?
###962 You can just redirect your anger towards the garbage.
###966 And also, I think it being a bummer will help kind of level
###969 everybody's moods.
###970 
###989 Thar she blows!
###990 
###997 MEREDITH DANLUCK: Oh, god.
###998 
###1001 The only thing that exists is, like, this boat, and the
###1004 people on it, and whatever this leviathan we're searching
###1009 for, this Captain Ahab, Moby Dick situation we have going
###1013 on here for this trash island, which I'm starting to get--
###1017 If We don't fucking find something--
###1022 MEREDITH DANLUCK: --I'll really lose my mind.
###1023 
###1027 MEREDITH DANLUCK: That's what's freaking me out, man.
###1029 
###1038 Captain, how far now until the garbage patch?
###1041 CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE: Yeah, we're a day away.
###1044 We're just penetrating into the second cell right now.
###1049 JAKE BURGHART: This is where we expect to find the--
###1051 CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE: That's where we'd expect to find the
###1052 highest concentrations, yeah.
###1056 JAKE BURGHART: We just officially passed
###1057 the 1,500 mile mark.
###1059 We got 1,500 miles to go, so we're halfway, which is
###1063 insane, because we've been here for so fucking long.
###1067 Thomas is up spotting pieces of trash.
###1072 We've been seeing pieces of trash every day, just, you
###1076 know, here and there.
###1078 I think in my mind-- and probably
###1082 Meredith's and Thomas--
###1084 we were eventually going to arrive somewhere.
###1087 We're going to get to the place where this is where all
###1089 the trash is.
###1091 CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE: Everybody says, show me a
###1092 picture of the garbage.
###1094 OK, well, it's spread out.
###1096 It's diffuse.
###1097 This is an enormous ocean.
###1098 So you're not going to find--
###1099 THOMAS MORTON: I understand that.
###1100 CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE: You're not going to find a dump.
###1102 There's no trash dump down here.
###1104 JAKE BURGHART: I was sort of under the impression that
###1106 there was going to be a visible patch somewhere, where
###1109 it's like--
###1110 where you could walk out on the deck and just be like--
###1111 CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE: Well, there's a windrow.
###1112 JAKE BURGHART: --there's garbage, garbage, garbage,
###1113 everywhere.
###1114 Yeah, like you were saying--
###1114 CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE: A windrow of garbage.
###1115 --patterns in the garbage.
###1115 CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE: But it's a line
###1115 and it's not a pattern.
###1117 JAKE BURGHART: We just need, like, for the big--
###1121 we've got everything we need, so much good stuff, so much
###1124 good information.
###1124 And I'm really happy, I think it's a really good piece.
###1126 But we need the big--
###1128 CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE: Well, I think that it's your job to
###1131 stay on deck.
###1132 MEREDITH DANLUCK: Yeah, but we also have to sleep for at
###1134 least a few hours every day.
###1138 JAKE BURGHART: We're all on the same team, we just need to
###1140 get something that--
###1141 CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE: Well, we're ready
###1142 to move to any location.
###1143 It's not so important where you look.
###1146 It's looking at the calmest part of the ocean.
###1149 Because that's when the stuff floats up to the top.
###1151 The crap is everywhere.
###1153 But it floats up to the top in the calm.
###1155 Well, that's where I've brought you.
###1156 I've brought you to the calm.
###1157 This is the calmest part of the ocean.
###1159 
###1184 JAKE BURGHART: Woo!
###1186 Fuck you!
###1189 Spring break, the gyre, 2007!
###1193 Woo!
###1194 
###1197 Boo-ya!
###1198 MEREDITH DANLUCK: Another buoy?
###1199 THOMAS MORTON: That's a-- or is it a helmet?
###1201 MEREDITH DANLUCK: It's a helmet.
###1201 THOMAS MORTON: Dude, that's creepy.
###1203 MEREDITH DANLUCK: That is so creepy.
###1205 THOMAS MORTON: Creepy as shit.
###1207 MEREDITH DANLUCK: With a big chunk out of it.
###1210 JAKE BURGHART: Put it on.
###1212 [LAUGHING]
###1212 THOMAS MORTON: That shit's alive, asshole.
###1214 
###1217 Ew, it's fucking moving.
###1219 [LAUGHING]
###1219 THOMAS MORTON: That wasn't worth it.
###1222 What kind of shot was that?
###1223 Hang on.
###1224 Should I be saying something?
###1228 It's hard to believe, looking at this.
###1230 I mean, this water is, like, beyond Crayola blue.
###1234 JAKE BURGHART: We got some fucking--
###1236 MEREDITH DANLUCK: Ew!
###1237 THOMAS MORTON: Ew!
###1239 MEREDITH DANLUCK: I don't want that one.
###1240 [LAUGHING]
###1242 THOMAS MORTON: That's glass though, right?
###1244 So that's not as bad?
###1245 Or--
###1246 JAKE BURGHART: That's not so much of a concern.
###1247 [ENGINE REVVING]
###1249 MEREDITH DANLUCK: Wait, wait, wait.
###1250 Whoa, whoa, whoa.
###1251 Jake.
###1252 [LAUGHING]
