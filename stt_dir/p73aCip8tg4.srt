0:0:19,0 --> 0:0:23,0
It was an incredible thing to see. 
We are going to tell you how it all turned out.


2
0:0:23,0 --> 0:0:28,68
I`m Carl Azuz. 
Welcome to a new week of CNN STUDENT NEWS.


3
0:0:28,68 --> 0:0:33,94
Last week we reported on Malala Yousafzai.
She`s a blogger and an activist for education


4
0:0:33,94 --> 0:0:39,129
and women`s rights. She`s 14 years old. Last
Tuesday, Malala was targeted and shot by the


5
0:0:39,129 --> 0:0:43,569
Taliban. That`s a militant group that has
a strong presence in the part of Pakistan


6
0:0:43,569 --> 0:0:48,329
where Malala lives. Lot of her country has
rallied behind her. Thousands of people turning


7
0:0:48,329 --> 0:0:52,969
out to be part of a demonstration in the city
of Karachi this weekend. They were showing


8
0:0:52,969 --> 0:0:58,329
their support for Malala and speaking out
against the Taliban and its strict policies.


9
0:0:58,329 --> 0:1:3,59
Those include denying girls the chance to
get an education, and that`s something that


10
0:1:3,59 --> 0:1:8,43
Malala spoke out against. Pakistani officials
say doctors are keeping a close watch on Malala.


11
0:1:8,43 --> 0:1:13,28
As of yesterday afternoon, she was unconscious
and using a breathing machine, but authorities


12
0:1:13,28 --> 0:1:15,83
said she is making slow and steady progress.


13
0:1:15,83 --> 0:1:17,72
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


14
0:1:17,72 --> 0:1:24,15
See if you can I.D. me.
I am an organization that was established


15
0:1:24,15 --> 0:1:30,61
after World War II. I currently have 27 member
countries. A continent is a part of my name,


16
0:1:30,61 --> 0:1:35,22
and my currency is the Euro.


17
0:1:35,22 --> 0:1:42,72
I`m the European Union. And I`m responsible
for my members` economic, social and security policies


18
0:1:42,72 --> 0:1:45,6
(END VIDEO CLIP)


19
0:1:45,6 --> 0:1:50,83
The Nobel Committee says the European
Union`s efforts to advance peace, democracy


20
0:1:50,83 --> 0:1:55,8
and human rights are why that organization,
the European Union is this year`s winner of


21
0:1:55,8 --> 0:1:59,8
the Nobel Peace Prize. The award was announced
last Friday. It`s not the first time that


22
0:1:59,8 --> 0:2:4,35
an organization has won the Peace Prize instead
of an individual person. The committee says


23
0:2:4,35 --> 0:2:9,64
the E.U.`s win is a message to the whole world
about finding ways to solve conflicts. 


24
0:2:9,64 --> 0:2:11,909
For more, we turn to Jonathan Mann.


25
0:2:11,909 --> 0:2:13,68
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


26
0:2:13,68 --> 0:2:20,17
Look past all the protests 
in the streets of Spain and Greece.


27
0:2:20,17 --> 0:2:26,42
Look past all the high level talks
and tangled finances. Look back to the centuries


28
0:2:26,42 --> 0:2:32,23
of war in Europe, a place where nowadays dozens
of countries are so completely at peace that


29
0:2:32,23 --> 0:2:38,34
virtually no one notices. The Norwegian Nobel
Committee awarded the Peace Prize for 2012


30
0:2:38,34 --> 0:2:43,34
to the European Union. Because born out of
the ashes of World War II as a way to unify


31
0:2:43,34 --> 0:2:49,129
the continent and keep it from fighting again,
the Nobel Committee says the European Union has worked.


32
0:2:49,129 --> 0:2:52,409
THORBJORN JAGLAND, CHAIR OF THE NORWEGIAN
NOBEL COMMITTEE: Over a 70 year period, Germany


33
0:2:52,409 --> 0:3:0,769
and France had fought three wars. Today, war
between Germany and France had -- is unthinkable.


34
0:3:0,769 --> 0:3:9,9
This shows of true well aimed efforts and
while building mutual confidence, 


35
0:3:9,9 --> 0:3:11,439
historic enemies can become close parties.


36
0:3:11,439 --> 0:3:18,4
The partnership now includes 27 nations,
with more waiting to join. 500 million people


37
0:3:18,4 --> 0:3:23,519
grappling with their own national politics
evolving European institutions, and its still


38
0:3:23,519 --> 0:3:28,849
experimental common currency mired in crisis.
Everything from interest rates to austerity


39
0:3:28,849 --> 0:3:34,34
measures and unemployment eventually leads
back to the E.U. In the streets of Spain,


40
0:3:34,34 --> 0:3:39,709
where the economy went from boom to bust,
the E.U. is both credited and criticized,


41
0:3:39,709 --> 0:3:42,519
and its Nobel Prize got a mixed reaction.


42
0:3:42,519 --> 0:3:47,1
All right. We are wrapping up out Hispanic
heritage month coverage today with a tasty


43
0:3:47,1 --> 0:3:52,319
segment for you. Here is some food for thought:
did you know the names of some of the things


44
0:3:52,319 --> 0:3:59,68
we eat and drink have Spanish ties. Like the
chocolate in my hot chocolate. It`s pronounced


45
0:3:59,68 --> 0:4:5,26
chocolate, the word comes from Nahuatl,, which
is a group of languages from parts of Mexico


46
0:4:5,26 --> 0:4:11,239
and Central America. Another tasty word with
Spanish routs is tomato, the name of this fruit


47
0:4:11,239 --> 0:4:16,709
yes, this is technically a fruit, comes
from Nahuatl, too. In Spanish, it`s tomate.


48
0:4:16,709 --> 0:4:21,109
We can`t give you fruit and dessert without
a main course. Tuna, like the fish, comes


49
0:4:21,109 --> 0:4:26,0
from the Spanish word, atun.


50
0:4:26,0 --> 0:4:30,17
I think it`s a pretty amazing event, 
that`s why I`m here with my daughter,


51
0:4:30,17 --> 0:4:33,34
to make sure that she sees it 
and is a part of it.


52
0:4:33,34 --> 0:4:36,56
Also, once in a lifetime thing to see a special, 
all going down the street,


53
0:4:36,56 --> 0:4:45,42
especially at the streets of L.A.,
so I had to see it.


54
0:4:45,42 --> 0:4:50,56
You heard it right, and it was a sight
to see. A space shuttle rolling down the streets


55
0:4:50,56 --> 0:4:56,85
of Los Angeles, not part of a movie, it`s
the final act for NASA`s shuttle program.


56
0:4:56,85 --> 0:5:3,35
That is Endeavour. It flew 123 million miles
in space cruising along at supersonic speed.


57
0:5:3,35 --> 0:5:9,35
This weekend, it was crawling, just crawling
along the roads of California. It`s not because


58
0:5:9,35 --> 0:5:13,87
of traffic. Endeavour had the streets to itself,
as it`s slowly made its way to the California


59
0:5:13,87 --> 0:5:19,35
Science Center where it`s going on display.
It turns out, this last journey had some holdups.


60
0:5:19,35 --> 0:5:24,67
Streets, no surprise aren`t designed for shuttles
that are nearly 80 feet wide and more than


61
0:5:24,67 --> 0:5:30,53
120 feet long. So some road signs had to be
taken down, some trees, some of them very


62
0:5:30,53 --> 0:5:34,81
old, had to be cut down. But officials said
aside from that, there were no reports of


63
0:5:34,81 --> 0:5:38,86
damage to or by the shuttle.


64
0:5:38,86 --> 0:5:44,93
This was more like a space dive than a sky
dive. Yesterday afternoon, Felix Baumgartner


65
0:5:44,93 --> 0:5:51,87
was trying to set the record for the highest
jump, from 120,000 feet above the Earth. Not


66
0:5:51,87 --> 0:5:57,8
exactly, how it went down. He stepped out
from his capsule at 128,000 feet. That is


67
0:5:57,8 --> 0:6:3,99
more than 24 miles up. Scientists say, he
broke the speed of sound as he hurdled toward


68
0:6:3,99 --> 0:6:8,87
earth. You can imagine what that must have
felt like. It took ten minutes for the 43-year


69
0:6:8,87 --> 0:6:15,12
old Austrian daredevil known as Fearless Felix
to be back on solid ground. Max Foster spoke


70
0:6:15,12 --> 0:6:18,6
to him before his record shattering skydive.


71
0:6:18,6 --> 0:6:23,42
What no man has ever done before: jump from a capsule


72
0:6:23,42 --> 0:6:30,28
attached to a giant balloon from 120,000 feet
where the view looks like this.


73
0:6:30,28 --> 0:6:34,24
I`m going to slide the door open, bail out


74
0:6:34,24 --> 0:6:39,12
and then going to be the first human person
in freefall, who`s breaking the speed of sound.


75
0:6:39,12 --> 0:6:44,15
FOSTER: He makes it sound simple enough, but
Felix Baumgartner`s attempt to jump from the


76
0:6:44,15 --> 0:6:50,92
edge of space comes after five years of exhaustive
testing, development and even a legal hatch.


77
0:6:50,92 --> 0:6:56,6
What`s the biggest challenge here, 
why have - has no one tried it before


78
0:6:56,6 --> 0:6:59,96
and what`s the challenge that you`ve managed
to overcome to make it possible?


79
0:6:59,96 --> 0:7:5,99
It needs a lot of research, 
it`s not just you lock yourself in a pressure capsule


80
0:7:5,99 --> 0:7:9,38
and you go up, you need a lot of research.
You need to find the right people to work with.


81
0:7:9,38 --> 0:7:14,68
Explain a bit more about the suit, how it works, 
and what sort of technology is in there.


82
0:7:14,68 --> 0:7:19,3
So the suit is protecting you.
It provides you with oxygen, it keeps temperature,


83
0:7:19,3 --> 0:7:24,81
the cold temperature out. It also -- you also
need the pressure suit, because if you reach


84
0:7:24,81 --> 0:7:29,89
65,000 feet, which is called the Armstrong
Line, your blood starts boiling. And that


85
0:7:29,89 --> 0:7:31,78
suit keeps you alive.


86
0:7:31,78 --> 0:7:35,49
It`s beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.


87
0:7:35,49 --> 0:7:41,92
Baumgartner is no stranger to death-defying
stunts. He has based- jumped from the world`s tallest buildings,


88
0:7:41,92 --> 0:7:48,0
set a record for the lowest such jump of 
Rio`s Christ the Redeemer statue


89
0:7:48,0 --> 0:7:53,22
and completed the first crossing of the English
Channel with a specially made fiber wing.


90
0:7:53,22 --> 0:7:56,72
But freefalling from the edge of space is
a whole new ball game.


91
0:7:56,72 --> 0:8:1,29
The big problem that we faced
here, is at 120,000 feet you have no supportive air. 


92
0:8:1,29 --> 0:8:6,71
So the first 30 seconds, you cannot use
the air, and that requires a really stable


93
0:8:6,71 --> 0:8:12,389
exit, that`s the reason why we 
practiced a lot of bungee jumps.


94
0:8:12,389 --> 0:8:13,67
Perfect.


95
0:8:13,67 --> 0:8:17,85
You had a chance to meet Neil Armstrong. 
I just wanted to ask you about


96
0:8:17,85 --> 0:8:21,4
it, in 2010, didn`t you? 
So, what advice did he give you?


97
0:8:21,4 --> 0:8:25,35
Well, he said, go for it, you`ve
got the right team behind you, you are prepared,


98
0:8:25,35 --> 0:8:32,81
you have the skills, so he definitely thinks
it`s possible.


99
0:8:32,81 --> 0:8:38,44
Halloween still a couple of weeks away,
but we are giving you a spooky showcase for


100
0:8:38,44 --> 0:8:41,6
your creative pumpkin projects right now.


101
0:8:41,6 --> 0:8:45,34
We are talking about Halloween I-reports.
You`ve got to be at least 13, send us your


102
0:8:45,34 --> 0:8:51,26
best by October, 26th, and your pumpkin, which
doesn`t have to have my face on it, could


103
0:8:51,26 --> 0:8:55,16
pop up on cnn/studentnews. Boo-ya!


104
0:8:55,16 --> 0:9:0,41
Before we go, maybe you don`t agree with one
contestant in this cook-off, who said it`s


105
0:9:0,41 --> 0:9:4,57
what nature intended for people to eat. But
if you are looking to make your taste buds


106
0:9:4,57 --> 0:9:10,93
really jump, you might go nuts for squirrel,
and not just run off the fence grilled squirrel.


107
0:9:10,93 --> 0:9:15,94
We are talking about jalapeno squirrel poppers.
Squirrel burgers and sliders, bacon wraps


108
0:9:15,94 --> 0:9:21,4
squirrel wings, not sure how they pulled off
that last recipe, since squirrels don`t have


109
0:9:21,4 --> 0:9:24,61
wings, but there is no way we are going to
squirrel out of having a little pun with this.


110
0:9:24,61 --> 0:9:28,49
Of course, it might sound a little nutty,
some of you think all of our pans are acorny,


111
0:9:28,49 --> 0:9:32,72
but we always hop at the chance to put them
to the nest, and frankly, I see nutting wrong


112
0:9:32,72 --> 0:9:35,95
with that. Thanks to our Facebook and Twitter
followers for helping out with those, 


113
0:9:35,95 --> 0:11:35,95
CNN STUDENT NEWS, we`ll tree you tomorrow.
