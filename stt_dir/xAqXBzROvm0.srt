2
0:0:17,82 --> 0:0:20,12
ELLIOT BAMBROUGH: We're here in
Soweto at one of the many


3
0:0:20,12 --> 0:0:22,1
taxi ranks that dot
the landscape.


4
0:0:22,1 --> 0:0:23,65
That's because they're the
most popular form of


5
0:0:23,65 --> 0:0:26,5
transportation in the townships
because most people


6
0:0:26,5 --> 0:0:28,16
don't have the money to buy
a vehicle themselves.


7
0:0:28,16 --> 0:0:30,16
And it gives them accessibility
to places all


8
0:0:30,16 --> 0:0:30,9
over Johannesburg.


9
0:0:30,9 --> 0:0:34,1
The taxi drivers themselves have
played a key and evolving


10
0:0:34,1 --> 0:0:36,79
role in shaping the music
scene here in Soweto.


11
0:0:36,79 --> 0:0:39,26
But joining me for this
mission is Krishna.


12
0:0:39,26 --> 0:0:40,905
Krishna is from Brooklyn.


13
0:0:40,905 --> 0:0:41,28
How ya doing?


14
0:0:41,28 --> 0:0:42,28
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Hey, doing
great, how about you?


15
0:0:42,28 --> 0:0:43,4
ELLIOT BAMBROUGH: I'm doing
really well, thanks.


16
0:0:43,4 --> 0:0:45,645
So we're going to go now and
find out a little bit more


17
0:0:45,645 --> 0:0:48,63
about how these guys actually
fit into the music scene.


18
0:0:48,63 --> 0:0:50,93
So tell me, what is Krishna?


19
0:0:50,93 --> 0:0:53,8
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Well, I'm a
writer and an editor for an


20
0:0:53,8 --> 0:0:56,26
online-only magazine that's
about death and dying.


21
0:0:56,26 --> 0:0:57,18
ELLIOT BAMBROUGH: An
online magazine


22
0:0:57,18 --> 0:0:58,79
about death and dying?


23
0:0:58,79 --> 0:0:59,31
How big is your audience?


24
0:0:59,31 --> 0:1:0,842
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Well, they're
all dying, so they


25
0:1:0,842 --> 0:1:1,18
don't even count.


26
0:1:1,18 --> 0:1:1,63
ELLIOT BAMBROUGH: [LAUGH]


27
0:1:1,63 --> 0:1:2,198
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: We
don't even know, we


28
0:1:2,198 --> 0:1:3,87
can't even keep track.


29
0:1:3,87 --> 0:1:6,6
So what do you know about the
music scene in Johannesburg.


30
0:1:6,6 --> 0:1:9,18
ELLIOT BAMBROUGH: It was born
out of the townships and at


31
0:1:9,18 --> 0:1:10,2
the end of apartheid.


32
0:1:10,2 --> 0:1:13,55
So we're talking
about '93, '94.


33
0:1:13,55 --> 0:1:15,58
The music that sprung up


34
0:1:15,58 --> 0:1:17,825
instantaneously was called kwaito.


35
0:1:17,825 --> 0:1:19,84
So to get the music to the
people, and to get these


36
0:1:19,84 --> 0:1:22,9
people hearing this new kwaito
music, the artists found the


37
0:1:22,9 --> 0:1:26,95
best way of doing it was
by using taxi drivers.


38
0:1:26,95 --> 0:1:30,54
So the artists would give
their demos to the taxi


39
0:1:30,54 --> 0:1:33,14
drivers to play in
their taxis.


40
0:1:33,14 --> 0:1:37,45
And that's how these musicians
and kwaito stars broke into


41
0:1:37,45 --> 0:1:41,67
the bigtime in the '90s,
was via taxi drivers.


42
0:1:41,67 --> 0:1:42,5
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU:
That's amazing.


43
0:1:42,5 --> 0:1:44,55
ELLIOT BAMBROUGH: So rather than
me going on and on about


44
0:1:44,55 --> 0:1:46,632
my definition of kwaito,
do you actually


45
0:1:46,632 --> 0:1:47,56
want to hear some?


46
0:1:47,56 --> 0:1:48,45
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Yeah,
absolutely.


47
0:1:48,45 --> 0:1:50,11
ELLIOT BAMBROUGH: OK, hang
on, let me sync up.

[MUSIC PLAYING - KWAITO]


49
0:1:53,87 --> 0:1:56,9
ELLIOT BAMBROUGH: So
this is kwaito.


50
0:1:56,9 --> 0:1:59,2
And this is one of the biggest
stars in kwaito.


51
0:1:59,2 --> 0:2:0,86
This guy's called Brickz.


52
0:2:0,86 --> 0:2:1,55
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Wow.


53
0:2:1,55 --> 0:2:2,62
ELLIOT BAMBROUGH:
What do think?


54
0:2:2,62 --> 0:2:3,61
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: I think
it's awesome.


55
0:2:3,61 --> 0:2:7,74
ELLIOT BAMBROUGH: Well, we are
actually on our way now to go


56
0:2:7,74 --> 0:2:8,52
and meet Brickz.


57
0:2:8,52 --> 0:2:9,82
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Man,
that's exciting.


58
0:2:9,82 --> 0:2:11,295
ELLIOT BAMBROUGH: A
star of the music.


59
0:2:11,295 --> 0:2:12,966
So we're on our way now.

[MUSIC PLAYING - KWAITO]


61
0:2:39,61 --> 0:2:40,72
ELLIOT BAMBROUGH: Brickz,
first off, awesome


62
0:2:40,72 --> 0:2:40,985
performance.


63
0:2:40,985 --> 0:2:41,99
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Yeah,
that was amazing.


64
0:2:41,99 --> 0:2:43,91
ELLIOT BAMBROUGH: You put a
whole lot of energy into that.


65
0:2:43,91 --> 0:2:44,81
BRICKZ: Thanks guys,
thanks guys.


66
0:2:44,81 --> 0:2:47,54
I try to make sure that
I bring personal


67
0:2:47,54 --> 0:2:49,61
experiences in my music.


68
0:2:49,61 --> 0:2:50,48

0:2:50,48 --> 0:2:52,75
And everything that's happens
in the streets.


70
0:2:52,75 --> 0:2:54,1
It's more like hip-hop.


71
0:2:54,1 --> 0:2:57,6
People who listen to kwaito,
they are mostly people who


72
0:2:57,6 --> 0:2:58,93
understand ghetto life.


73
0:2:58,93 --> 0:3:1,64
ELLIOT BAMBROUGH: And am I right
in thinking that taxi


74
0:3:1,64 --> 0:3:4,453
drivers were the way that
everyone got their music out


75
0:3:4,453 --> 0:3:5,29
to the people?


76
0:3:5,29 --> 0:3:8,1
BRICKZ: Yes, because most
taxi drivers, they


77
0:3:8,1 --> 0:3:9,48
come from the township.


78
0:3:9,48 --> 0:3:12,19
And taxi drivers know
how to pump a song.


79
0:3:12,19 --> 0:3:15,84
And each and every one who goes
in and out the taxi gets


80
0:3:15,84 --> 0:3:18,5
to hear your song,
which is good.


81
0:3:18,5 --> 0:3:21,47
When someone gets out of
the car, he wants to go


82
0:3:21,47 --> 0:3:22,355
and buy that CD.


83
0:3:22,355 --> 0:3:23,63
And that's what you want.

KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Could you
teach us that Mandela dance


85

before we go?

0:3:43,94 --> 0:3:45,88
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: We're at

92
0:3:45,88 --> 0:3:49,275
It's one of the largest taxi
stands in the city.

turn up the music at

ELLIOT BAMBROUGH: Are there

100
0:4:24,425 --> 0:4:27,65
I have to go in his taxi because
I know that I'll hear


101
0:4:27,65 --> 0:4:29,21

102
0:4:29,21 --> 0:4:30,46

0:4:39,53 --> 0:4:40,55
probably, right?


107

So you probably have
a big soundsystem.

Let's do this.

in the back here.

KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Yeah,
this is good.


117
0:5:4,9 --> 0:5:6,38
ELLIOT BAMBROUGH: I think you
actually have to be in there


118
0:5:6,38 --> 0:5:8,125
to really appreciate the power
of the subwoofer sitting in


119
0:5:8,125 --> 0:5:10,5
the back and it reverberating
through your entire body.


120
0:5:10,5 --> 0:5:11,71
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU:
It felt great.

ever in Soweto and you're

124
0:5:17,53 --> 0:5:21,246
A mundane thing like getting in
a cab, anywhere else in the

world, is just that.


126
0:5:22,63 --> 0:5:25,12
But here, it's almost just
like you're immersed in a


127
0:5:25,12 --> 0:5:26,37
cultural activity.


128
0:5:26,37 --> 0:5:27,771
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: When I was
expecting to come here, I


129
0:5:27,771 --> 0:5:31,855
thought, you know, taxi stands
in New York are shit holes.


130
0:5:31,855 --> 0:5:34,846
But this is like, it's kind of
nice here, and the taxis


131
0:5:34,846 --> 0:5:36,286
themselves are just
immaculate.

the music that you

play in your taxi?

ELLIOT BAMBROUGH: House music.

you think it's an


139
0:6:29,65 --> 0:6:30,9
evolution of the sound?


140
0:6:30,9 --> 0:6:42,34



141
0:6:42,34 --> 0:6:45,525
ELLIOT BAMBROUGH: In America and
in Europe, you get into a


142
0:6:45,525 --> 0:6:47,68
taxi, you don't talk
to the taxi driver.


143
0:6:47,68 --> 0:6:48,86
You don't want to
hear his music.


144
0:6:48,86 --> 0:6:49,81
You turn it down.


145
0:6:49,81 --> 0:6:52,41
And here it's a totally
different lifestyle and


146
0:6:52,41 --> 0:6:55,4
acceptance of, you get into it
because you want to have a


147
0:6:55,4 --> 0:6:55,65
conversation.


148
0:6:55,65 --> 0:6:56,52
You want to hear the music.


149
0:6:56,52 --> 0:6:59,9

promoter, in that respect?

0:7:6,71 --> 0:7:8,77
called DJ Qness.

an authority on house music

the taxi drivers have played

of making it.

has changed.

linked with music and giving
