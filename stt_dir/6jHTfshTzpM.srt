2
0:0:9,92 --> 0:0:10,7
ANGIE SULLIVAN: Hi.


3
0:0:10,7 --> 0:0:11,79
I'm Angie Sullivan.


4
0:0:11,79 --> 0:0:13,18
And this is my friend Rufus.


5
0:0:13,18 --> 0:0:15,81
We're here today in Southport,
Connecticut, to meet with


6
0:0:15,81 --> 0:0:18,855
Kendall Crolius and learn all
about knitting with dog hair.


7
0:0:18,855 --> 0:0:20,84
Come on, Rufus.


8
0:0:20,84 --> 0:0:23,98
We recently did a piece in
"Vice" with photographer Erwin


9
0:0:23,98 --> 0:0:24,52
[INAUDIBLE]


10
0:0:24,52 --> 0:0:26,35
on dog hair garments.


11
0:0:26,35 --> 0:0:28,24
And we're here today
to find out how the


12
0:0:28,24 --> 0:0:29,905
whole process is done.


13
0:0:29,905 --> 0:0:33,4
KENDALL CROLUIS: I have been
knitting with dog hair for


14
0:0:33,4 --> 0:0:34,925
about 25 years now.


15
0:0:34,925 --> 0:0:36,14
Hey, Rufus.


16
0:0:36,14 --> 0:0:38,72
So this has been a very
important part of my life.


17
0:0:38,72 --> 0:0:39,765
I'm Kendall Crolius.


18
0:0:39,765 --> 0:0:43,21
I'm a co-author of "Knitting
with Dog Hair." And I'm


19
0:0:43,21 --> 0:0:45,97
delighted to have you
here with us today.


20
0:0:45,97 --> 0:0:49,42
I have always loved needlework
of all kinds.


21
0:0:49,42 --> 0:0:50,71
Knitting, all of that.


22
0:0:50,71 --> 0:0:52,67
And I'd always wanted to
learn how to spin.


23
0:0:52,67 --> 0:0:54,74
I thought that would be
a fun thing to know.


24
0:0:54,74 --> 0:0:58,35
And many years ago I was able to
take a spinning course at a


25
0:0:58,35 --> 0:1:0,16
local fiber arts store.


26
0:1:0,16 --> 0:1:3,68
And one of the things that the
teacher said to us was, by the


27
0:1:3,68 --> 0:1:5,96
way, you don't have to
limit yourself to


28
0:1:5,96 --> 0:1:7,54
wool, to sheep wool.


29
0:1:7,54 --> 0:1:8,96
You can spin anything.


30
0:1:8,96 --> 0:1:10,87
You could even spin dog hair.


31
0:1:10,87 --> 0:1:12,88
And I thought, well,
that's interesting.


32
0:1:12,88 --> 0:1:16,61
Because we had a golden
retriever who shed like crazy.


33
0:1:16,61 --> 0:1:17,74
And I thought, well, let
me see whether I can do


34
0:1:17,74 --> 0:1:20,51
something with that.


35
0:1:20,51 --> 0:1:24,89
This is one of the sweaters
that we made for the book.


36
0:1:24,89 --> 0:1:29,77
This is actually a dog sweater
with a dog on it.


37
0:1:29,77 --> 0:1:32,94
The white part is
Great Pyrenees.


38
0:1:32,94 --> 0:1:34,54
Very soft and nice.


39
0:1:34,54 --> 0:1:39,97
The brown dog is actually made
from Newfoundland yarn.


40
0:1:39,97 --> 0:1:40,69
But I love that.


41
0:1:40,69 --> 0:1:43,71
My son wore that and
was on the cover


42
0:1:43,71 --> 0:1:45,81
of the first edition.


43
0:1:45,81 --> 0:1:46,93
ANGIE SULLIVAN: OK, Kendall.


44
0:1:46,93 --> 0:1:49,98
Can you start with showing us
what the first step is to


45
0:1:49,98 --> 0:1:51,1
knitting with dog hair?


46
0:1:51,1 --> 0:1:53,93
KENDALL CROLUIS: Well, the first
step is getting a dog.


47
0:1:53,93 --> 0:1:56,18
And we have Rufus here
with us today.


48
0:1:56,18 --> 0:1:59,39
He's a fabulous candidate
for dog hair knitting.


49
0:1:59,39 --> 0:2:0,1
Right?


50
0:2:0,1 --> 0:2:1,87
Because you've got
a fabulous coat.


51
0:2:1,87 --> 0:2:5,6
And we're going to brush you to
get some of the stuff off


52
0:2:5,6 --> 0:2:5,83
you that we need.


53
0:2:5,83 --> 0:2:7,43
We're not going to shave you.


54
0:2:7,43 --> 0:2:8,985
We're not going to shear you.


55
0:2:8,985 --> 0:2:11,9
And we're not going
to cut your hair.


56
0:2:11,9 --> 0:2:13,52
See whether you can get some
good fuzz off of Rufus.


57
0:2:13,52 --> 0:2:14,4
ANGIE SULLIVAN: Yeah.


58
0:2:14,4 --> 0:2:15,266
KENDALL CROLUIS: Oh, yeah.


59
0:2:15,266 --> 0:2:17,91
Oh, he likes this.


60
0:2:17,91 --> 0:2:21,8
So we do this over a period of
weeks or months till we've got


61
0:2:21,8 --> 0:2:24,49
a nice big bag of dog hair.


62
0:2:24,49 --> 0:2:26,705
And you can see, I can
pull those off.


63
0:2:26,705 --> 0:2:29,23
And it's almost like cotton.


64
0:2:29,23 --> 0:2:32,88
Part of the appeal is that this
garment that you've made


65
0:2:32,88 --> 0:2:35,82
is a memento of a pet that
you've loved who maybe has


66
0:2:35,82 --> 0:2:37,73
gone on to dog heaven.


67
0:2:37,73 --> 0:2:41,28
Or the fashion statement of I'm
walking down the street,


68
0:2:41,28 --> 0:2:43,17
and look, my scarf
matches my golden


69
0:2:43,17 --> 0:2:46,42
retriever who I'm walking.


70
0:2:46,42 --> 0:2:49,37
Now we've collected all
of this from the dog.


71
0:2:49,37 --> 0:2:52,14
And it's a little stinky.


72
0:2:52,14 --> 0:2:55,13
And we'd like to start the
process of getting it clean.


73
0:2:55,13 --> 0:2:55,8
It's a little doggy.


74
0:2:55,8 --> 0:2:57,15
A little gamy.


75
0:2:57,15 --> 0:2:59,48
So we're gonna wash it.


76
0:2:59,48 --> 0:3:1,46
I tend to use dog shampoo.


77
0:3:1,46 --> 0:3:3,67
Just kind of mix it up.


78
0:3:3,67 --> 0:3:6,9
And then we're going
to dump that.


79
0:3:6,9 --> 0:3:6,665
ANGIE SULLIVAN: Just
throw it all in?


80
0:3:6,665 --> 0:3:7,235
KENDALL CROLUIS: Ew.


81
0:3:7,235 --> 0:3:7,96
Dog hair in the sink.


82
0:3:7,96 --> 0:3:10,42
So I'm gonna let that sit
for five minutes.


83
0:3:10,42 --> 0:3:12,99



84
0:3:12,99 --> 0:3:16,5
Well, there's really a wide
range of reactions.


85
0:3:16,5 --> 0:3:17,11
ANGIE SULLIVAN: It's
like cleaning out


86
0:3:17,11 --> 0:3:17,54
my drain in my shower.


87
0:3:17,54 --> 0:3:18,62
KENDALL CROLUIS: Exactly.


88
0:3:18,62 --> 0:3:19,55
Ew.


89
0:3:19,55 --> 0:3:22,62
I mean, there's some people,
primarily dog lovers, who just


90
0:3:22,62 --> 0:3:25,51
think, this is the greatest
thing since sliced bread.


91
0:3:25,51 --> 0:3:27,12
What a fantastic idea.


92
0:3:27,12 --> 0:3:29,9
And immediately see all of the
wonderful possibilities


93
0:3:29,9 --> 0:3:32,4
inherent in dog knitting.


94
0:3:32,4 --> 0:3:35,7
There are other people who are
completely grossed out.


95
0:3:35,7 --> 0:3:38,47
It's like, oh, that's
disgusting.


96
0:3:38,47 --> 0:3:40,6
Why would you want to do that?


97
0:3:40,6 --> 0:3:42,65
And doesn't it smell
like a wet dog?


98
0:3:42,65 --> 0:3:44,7
But the point is that
you wash the fiber.


99
0:3:44,7 --> 0:3:47,5
So it actually doesn't smell
like anything at all.


100
0:3:47,5 --> 0:3:50,2
Just as your wool sweaters don't
smell, neither does a


101
0:3:50,2 --> 0:3:52,8
dog hair sweater.


102
0:3:52,8 --> 0:3:52,76
Give a sniff.


103
0:3:52,76 --> 0:3:53,716
ANGIE SULLIVAN: Yep.


104
0:3:53,716 --> 0:3:55,15
KENDALL CROLUIS: You know?


105
0:3:55,15 --> 0:3:55,68
No worries, right?


106
0:3:55,68 --> 0:3:56,24
ANGIE SULLIVAN: Yeah, yeah.


107
0:3:56,24 --> 0:3:58,5
KENDALL CROLUIS: So just like
a sweater, I'm going to want


108
0:3:58,5 --> 0:4:0,24
to take some of that
moisture out of it.


109
0:4:0,24 --> 0:4:2,49
Kind of roll it up in a towel,
and that's a good way to get


110
0:4:2,49 --> 0:4:5,59
the moisture out without sort
of wringing the sweater or


111
0:4:5,59 --> 0:4:6,86
wringing the dog hair.


112
0:4:6,86 --> 0:4:10,5
And so we just kind of spread
those out so that there are no


113
0:4:10,5 --> 0:4:12,29
big, wet clumps sticking
together.


114
0:4:12,29 --> 0:4:15,6
The next thing we're going to
do is card it, which is kind


115
0:4:15,6 --> 0:4:18,525
of like brushing it so that we
get all the fibers pointed in


116
0:4:18,525 --> 0:4:19,775
the same direction.


117
0:4:19,775 --> 0:4:25,37



118
0:4:25,37 --> 0:4:26,17
ANGIE SULLIVAN: All right.


119
0:4:26,17 --> 0:4:28,36
So we brush the dog.


120
0:4:28,36 --> 0:4:29,446
KENDALL CROLUIS: We
brush the dog.


121
0:4:29,446 --> 0:4:30,66
And we have the fuzz.


122
0:4:30,66 --> 0:4:33,1
And the next step is
called carding.


123
0:4:33,1 --> 0:4:36,5
So what you do is you take
some of your clean fuzz.


124
0:4:36,5 --> 0:4:39,58
And you're just gonna kind
of stick it on there.


125
0:4:39,58 --> 0:4:45,12
And you're just gonna draw the
combs across each other.


126
0:4:45,12 --> 0:4:48,26
And all this is doing is
straightening out the fibers.


127
0:4:48,26 --> 0:4:50,47
Yep.


128
0:4:50,47 --> 0:4:51,46
See?


129
0:4:51,46 --> 0:4:53,66
Way to go?


130
0:4:53,66 --> 0:4:53,91
ANGIE SULLIVAN: And
then what's the


131
0:4:53,91 --> 0:4:54,41
next step after that?


132
0:4:54,41 --> 0:4:56,82
KENDALL CROLUIS: The next step
is actually to spin it.


133
0:4:56,82 --> 0:4:58,72
So I'm just going to kind
of get that kicked


134
0:4:58,72 --> 0:5:0,7
in the right direction.


135
0:5:0,7 --> 0:5:1,3
I'm spinning that along.


136
0:5:1,3 --> 0:5:2,75
And I'm pulling out fibers.


137
0:5:2,75 --> 0:5:4,68
And I let go and let it twist.


138
0:5:4,68 --> 0:5:7,86
The spinning motion, the other
wonderful thing, is it also


139
0:5:7,86 --> 0:5:11,43
then draws the finished yarn
up on to this bobbin.


140
0:5:11,43 --> 0:5:12,86
There are two steps that
you're going to


141
0:5:12,86 --> 0:5:14,15
do with your hand.


142
0:5:14,15 --> 0:5:16,11
You're going to pinch
with your left hand.


143
0:5:16,11 --> 0:5:16,89
ANGIE SULLIVAN: OK.


144
0:5:16,89 --> 0:5:19,22
KENDALL CROLUIS: So nothing's
twisting down here because


145
0:5:19,22 --> 0:5:20,39
you're pinching.


146
0:5:20,39 --> 0:5:24,18
And with your right hand, you're
going to pull back a


147
0:5:24,18 --> 0:5:25,32
little bit on this yarn.


148
0:5:25,32 --> 0:5:26,73
See, let go a little bit.


149
0:5:26,73 --> 0:5:26,99
See?


150
0:5:26,99 --> 0:5:27,51
It twists.


151
0:5:27,51 --> 0:5:28,3
ANGIE SULLIVAN: Oh.


152
0:5:28,3 --> 0:5:30,275
KENDALL CROLUIS: And then you
move your hand down here and


153
0:5:30,275 --> 0:5:31,11
do it again.


154
0:5:31,11 --> 0:5:31,4
ANGIE SULLIVAN: Oh.


155
0:5:31,4 --> 0:5:32,635
And this will be spinning
it tighter.


156
0:5:32,635 --> 0:5:33,6
KENDALL CROLUIS: Yeah.


157
0:5:33,6 --> 0:5:34,88
So I'm going to start
treadling real slow.


158
0:5:34,88 --> 0:5:35,19
OK.


159
0:5:35,19 --> 0:5:35,65
ANGIE SULLIVAN: All right.


160
0:5:35,65 --> 0:5:36,6
I'm just holding this?


161
0:5:36,6 --> 0:5:37,543
KENDALL CROLUIS: Now let
go a little bit.


162
0:5:37,543 --> 0:5:38,469
Yep, yep.


163
0:5:38,469 --> 0:5:39,395
ANGIE SULLIVAN: Oh,
I'm doing it.


164
0:5:39,395 --> 0:5:40,26
KENDALL CROLUIS: See?


165
0:5:40,26 --> 0:5:40,47
Look at you.


166
0:5:40,47 --> 0:5:41,245
You're a natural.


167
0:5:41,245 --> 0:5:43,295
You're a natural spinner.


168
0:5:43,295 --> 0:5:44,33
ANGIE SULLIVAN: So then
I grab some more?


169
0:5:44,33 --> 0:5:44,89
KENDALL CROLUIS: Rapunzel.


170
0:5:44,89 --> 0:5:45,9
Way to go.


171
0:5:45,9 --> 0:5:45,56
Yep.


172
0:5:45,56 --> 0:5:47,2
Don't let go.


173
0:5:47,2 --> 0:5:47,56
OK.


174
0:5:47,56 --> 0:5:49,17
Now I'm going to slow
down for a second.


175
0:5:49,17 --> 0:5:51,65
Now just glom some on there.


176
0:5:51,65 --> 0:5:52,24
ANGIE SULLIVAN: All right.


177
0:5:52,24 --> 0:5:52,89
KENDALL CROLUIS: Yep.


178
0:5:52,89 --> 0:5:54,0
Now you're getting a
lot of twist there.


179
0:5:54,0 --> 0:5:54,9
Let it go.


180
0:5:54,9 --> 0:5:55,5
Let it go.


181
0:5:55,5 --> 0:5:57,196
ANGIE SULLIVAN: Uh oh.


182
0:5:57,196 --> 0:5:57,69
KENDALL CROLUIS: Yeah.


183
0:5:57,69 --> 0:5:58,48
So you're a little lumpy.


184
0:5:58,48 --> 0:6:0,71
But not bad.


185
0:6:0,71 --> 0:6:3,35
This is stuff that was just
gonna clog up your vacuum


186
0:6:3,35 --> 0:6:5,91
cleaner, and here you can
put it to good use.


187
0:6:5,91 --> 0:6:10,3
So it's economical and it's
ecologically correct and


188
0:6:10,3 --> 0:6:11,28
environmentally sound.


189
0:6:11,28 --> 0:6:14,23
Very much an on-trend
craft, I think.


190
0:6:14,23 --> 0:6:16,65
People often ask, I'm not really
into dogs but I love my


191
0:6:16,65 --> 0:6:18,4
cats and can you
spin cat hair?


192
0:6:18,4 --> 0:6:19,57
And the answer is absolutely.


193
0:6:19,57 --> 0:6:22,4
Anything you can do with dog
hair you can do with cat hair.


194
0:6:22,4 --> 0:6:24,63
It's a little bit harder to
work with because it has a


195
0:6:24,63 --> 0:6:26,18
tendency to mat.


196
0:6:26,18 --> 0:6:28,99
But I have done some gloves
that's actually a Peaceable


197
0:6:28,99 --> 0:6:31,63
Kingdom Collection in that
it's got both dog


198
0:6:31,63 --> 0:6:33,76
and cat yarn in it.


199
0:6:33,76 --> 0:6:36,53
I don't actually remember
whose pets are


200
0:6:36,53 --> 0:6:38,19
which in all of this.


201
0:6:38,19 --> 0:6:42,34
But I do remember that the
thumbs are cat hair.


202
0:6:42,34 --> 0:6:43,47
Let's start you with this.


203
0:6:43,47 --> 0:6:45,633
This is a golden retriever
scarf.


204
0:6:45,633 --> 0:6:46,4
ANGIE SULLIVAN: All right.


205
0:6:46,4 --> 0:6:46,64
What was it's name.


206
0:6:46,64 --> 0:6:47,22
KENDALL CROLUIS: From Abigail.


207
0:6:47,22 --> 0:6:47,565
Abigail.


208
0:6:47,565 --> 0:6:48,6
ANGIE SULLIVAN: Abigail.


209
0:6:48,6 --> 0:6:50,2
KENDALL CROLUIS: And this
looks great with a


210
0:6:50,2 --> 0:6:51,91
camel's hair coat.


211
0:6:51,91 --> 0:6:54,84
Just really a perfect
match there.


212
0:6:54,84 --> 0:6:56,11
We'll give you two scarves.


213
0:6:56,11 --> 0:6:58,4
This is a woven scarf
which is wool.


214
0:6:58,4 --> 0:6:59,61
ANGIE SULLIVAN: Is this
also Abigail?


215
0:6:59,61 --> 0:7:0,59
KENDALL CROLUIS: That's
also Abigail.


216
0:7:0,59 --> 0:7:1,16
Yep.


217
0:7:1,16 --> 0:7:3,85
She was very prolific
in this department.


218
0:7:3,85 --> 0:7:5,83
This is a nice hat for you.


219
0:7:5,83 --> 0:7:6,477
It was a Newfoundland.


220
0:7:6,477 --> 0:7:7,87
I can't even remember
who it came from.


221
0:7:7,87 --> 0:7:9,71
Now I think, it is a cold day.


222
0:7:9,71 --> 0:7:12,54
So let's give you the
sweater as well.


223
0:7:12,54 --> 0:7:14,94
Now this is Great Pyrenees,
this is from Ollie.


224
0:7:14,94 --> 0:7:16,55
Oh, you look great.


225
0:7:16,55 --> 0:7:17,354
I'll tell you.


226
0:7:17,354 --> 0:7:18,16
ANGIE SULLIVAN: All right.


227
0:7:18,16 --> 0:7:19,99
KENDALL CROLUIS: And then your
hands must feel cold.


228
0:7:19,99 --> 0:7:20,65
ANGIE SULLIVAN: I feel
like a polar bear.


229
0:7:20,65 --> 0:7:23,755
KENDALL CROLUIS: So you're
gonna have dog and cat.


230
0:7:23,755 --> 0:7:26,3



231
0:7:26,3 --> 0:7:28,835
Now you don't have the urge
to go find a fire hydrant.


232
0:7:28,835 --> 0:7:31,39



233
0:7:31,39 --> 0:7:32,25
Nothing like that?


234
0:7:32,25 --> 0:7:32,81
ANGIE SULLIVAN: No.


235
0:7:32,81 --> 0:7:33,535
Maybe bark at the neighbors
or something.


236
0:7:33,535 --> 0:7:34,4
KENDALL CROLUIS: Yeah,
that's good.


237
0:7:34,4 --> 0:7:35,43
Howl at the moon.


238
0:7:35,43 --> 0:7:36,28
Something like that.


239
0:7:36,28 --> 0:7:39,79
If you were allergic to
dogs, no worries.


240
0:7:39,79 --> 0:7:40,21
Because--


241
0:7:40,21 --> 0:7:40,72
ANGIE SULLIVAN: Yeah.


242
0:7:40,72 --> 0:7:41,15
KENDALL CROLUIS: No,
it's interesting.


243
0:7:41,15 --> 0:7:43,56
Because when you're allergic to
dogs, you're actually not


244
0:7:43,56 --> 0:7:45,46
allergic to the fiber.


245
0:7:45,46 --> 0:7:47,21
You're allergic to the dander.


246
0:7:47,21 --> 0:7:49,42
ANGIE SULLIVAN: Oh, so once it's
all clean [INAUDIBLE].


247
0:7:49,42 --> 0:7:50,8
KENDALL CROLUIS: So once it's
washed and clean, there isn't


248
0:7:50,8 --> 0:7:51,95
any of that in there.


249
0:7:51,95 --> 0:7:55,4
And so even if you're allergic
to dogs you can quite happily


250
0:7:55,4 --> 0:7:55,75
wear dog hair.


251
0:7:55,75 --> 0:7:57,25
ANGIE SULLIVAN: Anyone
can wear this?


252
0:7:57,25 --> 0:7:57,72
KENDALL CROLUIS: Yeah.


253
0:7:57,72 --> 0:8:1,31
After we wrote the book and
people kind of got into it,


254
0:8:1,31 --> 0:8:3,79
more people found out about it,
I can't tell you how many


255
0:8:3,79 --> 0:8:5,83
letters I've received
for people who said,


256
0:8:5,83 --> 0:8:7,27
oh, I got your book.


257
0:8:7,27 --> 0:8:8,67
And I made a scarf.


258
0:8:8,67 --> 0:8:13,49
And now Fluffy is gone and I
can't tell you how grateful I


259
0:8:13,49 --> 0:8:15,93
am to have the scarf
made from Fluffy.


260
0:8:15,93 --> 0:8:19,12
And I really have dozens of
letters that say exactly that.


261
0:8:19,12 --> 0:8:21,24
So that's an important
emotional


262
0:8:21,24 --> 0:8:22,745
connection to all of this.


263
0:8:22,745 --> 0:8:24,62
ANGIE SULLIVAN: Thanks, Kendall,
for teaching us how


264
0:8:24,62 --> 0:8:26,33
to make dog hair yarn.


265
0:8:26,33 --> 0:8:27,7
KENDALL CROLUIS: Well,
you're very welcome.


266
0:8:27,7 --> 0:8:28,6
ANGIE SULLIVAN: And to make
sweaters out of it.


267
0:8:28,6 --> 0:8:29,94
KENDALL CROLUIS: And I'm
delighted that you're wearing


268
0:8:29,94 --> 0:8:33,74
a dog hair sweater home whether
you like it or not.


269
0:8:33,74 --> 0:8:34,7
Look at you.


270
0:8:34,7 --> 0:8:35,32
You're covered.


271
0:8:35,32 --> 0:10:35,32
