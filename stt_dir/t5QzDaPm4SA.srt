TOMMY ANDRES, CNN GUEST STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR:
I`m Tommy Andres from CNN Radio, and I`m filling


2
0:0:15,349 --> 0:0:18,88
in from Carl as we start a new week of CNN
STUDENT NEWS.


3
0:0:18,88 --> 0:0:22,91
First up, we are heading to Kenya, it has
the largest economy in East Africa. It`s a


4
0:0:22,91 --> 0:0:27,5
relatively stable country in the region that
isn`t always stable. And it`s a major U.S.


5
0:0:27,5 --> 0:0:31,349
Ally in the war against terrorism. So, what
happens in Kenya, can have a big impact on


6
0:0:31,349 --> 0:0:33,85
other countries. Here is what happened there
this weekend.

0:0:33,85 --> 0:0:34,79

8
0:0:34,79 --> 0:0:40,199
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I therefore declare Uhuru
Kenyatta the newly elected president ...


9
0:0:40,199 --> 0:0:42,239
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)


10
0:0:42,239 --> 0:0:44,679
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: ... of the Republic of
Kenya.


11
0:0:44,679 --> 0:0:50,7
RAILA ODINGA: Now, it is clear that the constitutionally
sanctioned process of electing a new set of


12
0:0:50,7 --> 0:0:56,359
leaders to take us to the next level has been
thwarted by another tainted election.


13
0:0:56,359 --> 0:0:57,629
(END VIDEO CLIP)


14
0:0:57,629 --> 0:1:2,289
ANDRES: Uhuru Kenyatta, the son of Kenya`s
first president, is said to become its youngest


15
0:1:2,289 --> 0:1:6,25
president. He`s also facing charges from the
International Criminal Court. The charges


16
0:1:6,25 --> 0:1:10,43
against Kenyatta involve his alleged role
in violence after Kenya`s last presidential


17
0:1:10,43 --> 0:1:16,409
election in 2007, when he was not a candidate.
Kenyatta denies those charges. Raila Odinga


18
0:1:16,409 --> 0:1:21,81
was Kenyatta`s main challenger in this election.
He is the one who said it was tainted. Kenya`s


19
0:1:21,81 --> 0:1:25,439
constitution says the candidate has to earn
just more than 50 percent in order to win.


20
0:1:25,439 --> 0:1:31,719
Kenyatta got 50.07 percent. Odinga said he`ll
challenge the election results in court.

22
0:1:33,329 --> 0:1:39,159
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Is this legit? Vatican
City is the smallest country in the world.


23
0:1:39,159 --> 0:1:46,7
It`s true. Vatican City, which is also called
The Holy See is smaller than the National


24
0:1:46,7 --> 0:1:48,39
Mall in Washington D.C.


25
0:1:48,39 --> 0:1:51,3
(END VIDEO CLIP)


26
0:1:51,3 --> 0:1:55,96
ANDRES: Vatican City is also the headquarters
of the Roman Catholic Church. The pope is


27
0:1:55,96 --> 0:2:0,99
the head of that church, but right now, there
is no pope. Pope Benedict XVI resigned last


28
0:2:0,99 --> 0:2:5,21
month. Tomorrow, cardinals, leaders in the
Catholic Church will start the process of


29
0:2:5,21 --> 0:2:10,52
electing a new pope during a conclave. Jonathan
Mann explains what that is and how it works.


30
0:2:10,52 --> 0:2:11,2
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


31
0:2:11,2 --> 0:2:15,47
JONATHAN MANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It`s the
oldest enduring electoral system in the world.


32
0:2:15,47 --> 0:2:20,78
And many of its traditions have been unchanged
for centuries. The conclave, which literally


33
0:2:20,78 --> 0:2:25,9
means locked with a key dates back to a time
when cardinals were locked in until they chose


34
0:2:25,9 --> 0:2:31,19
a new pope. Now, it`s the world that`s locked
out, figuratively speaking, as much of the


35
0:2:31,19 --> 0:2:36,54
conclave will take place behind closed doors.
The gathering begins with a morning mass in


36
0:2:36,54 --> 0:2:43,37
St. Peter`s Basilica. In the afternoon the
115 voting cardinals, those under 80 years


37
0:2:43,37 --> 0:2:48,86
old, enter the Sistine Chapel where each will
take an oath of secrecy. The penalty, automatic


38
0:2:48,86 --> 0:2:54,31
excommunication. After the oath, preparations
are made for the election taken by secret


39
0:2:54,31 --> 0:2:58,9
ballot. Lots are drawn to select three cardinals
who will help collect ballots, three more


40
0:2:58,9 --> 0:3:4,26
cardinals to count the votes, and three others
to review the results. Printed on the ballots,


41
0:3:4,26 --> 0:3:11,45
the words "Eligo in Summum Pontifecem," meaning
I elect as Supreme Pontiff. Each elector writes


42
0:3:11,45 --> 0:3:16,25
the name of one candidate on the lower half
of the ballot and folds it in half. Cardinals


43
0:3:16,25 --> 0:3:20,82
are not allowed to vote for themselves. Then
in order of seniority, the cardinals take


44
0:3:20,82 --> 0:3:25,81
their ballots to the altar. Each places a
folded ballot onto a small desk and then the


45
0:3:25,81 --> 0:3:28,43
ballot is dropped into a chalice.


46
0:3:28,43 --> 0:3:32,94
Once all the votes are cast, the ballots are
tallied, and the results are read aloud. More


47
0:3:32,94 --> 0:3:38,47
than a two thirds majority is needed to declare
a winner, in this case, 77 votes. If there


48
0:3:38,47 --> 0:3:43,0
is no winner, there is another vote. If there
is still no winner, two more votes are scheduled


49
0:3:43,0 --> 0:3:50,2
for the afternoon. Voting continues up to
four ballots each day until there is a winner.


50
0:3:50,2 --> 0:3:55,45
The ballots are burned after each session
in an incinerator inside the chapel. If there`s


51
0:3:55,45 --> 0:3:59,94
no winner, they are burned with the chemical
that gives off black smoke telling the crowd


52
0:3:59,94 --> 0:4:5,4
waiting in St. Peter`s Square that a new pope
has not yet been selected. When there is a


53
0:4:5,4 --> 0:4:11,34
winner, white smoke, a sign from the cardinals
that they have chosen a new pope to lead the


54
0:4:11,34 --> 0:4:14,59
church. Jonathan Mann, CNN, Atlanta.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Today`s "Shoutout" goes
out to Mr. Bredehoeff`s history class at the


58
0:4:21,97 --> 0:4:28,99
Tina-Avalon school in Tina, Missouri. The
USS Monitor was a naval ship involved in what


59
0:4:28,99 --> 0:4:37,52
war? Here we go, was it the War of 1812, Civil
War, Spanish-American War or World War I?


60
0:4:37,52 --> 0:4:45,56
You`ve got three seconds, go!


61
0:4:45,56 --> 0:4:52,53
The Monitor was an iron-clad union ship used
during the U.S. Civil War. That`s your answer


62
0:4:52,53 --> 0:4:54,639
and that`s your Shoutout


63
0:4:54,639 --> 0:4:56,689
(END VIDEO CLIP)


64
0:4:56,689 --> 0:5:1,199
ANDRES: The Monitor helped change the face
of naval warfare, with the ship from wooden


65
0:5:1,199 --> 0:5:5,889
ships to iron ones. It sank around 150 years
ago, but that wasn`t the end of the ship`s


66
0:5:5,889 --> 0:5:11,379
story. In 1973, the wreckage of the Monitor
was found. 2002, remains of two crew members


67
0:5:11,379 --> 0:5:16,409
were discovered. And just this past Friday,
those remains were laid to rest. Barbara Starr


68
0:5:16,409 --> 0:5:17,249
fills in the details.


69
0:5:17,249 --> 0:5:18,69
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


70
0:5:18,69 --> 0:5:24,46
BARBARA STARR, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Shoes worn
by sailor 150 years ago, perhaps in the final


71
0:5:24,46 --> 0:5:29,979
moments of his life on board the USS Monitor,
a renowned Civil War battleship.


72
0:5:29,979 --> 0:5:36,84
(on camera): This is extraordinary. We are
looking mismatched, put a pair of shoes that


73
0:5:36,84 --> 0:5:37,819
one of the sailors wore.


74
0:5:37,819 --> 0:5:41,27
DAVID KROP, MARINER`S MUSEUM: He had a different
shoe on his left foot than he did on his right.


75
0:5:41,27 --> 0:5:46,53
And it`s hard to explain why that is. One
of the possible options is that as these guys


76
0:5:46,53 --> 0:5:49,3
were leaving the ship the night of the sinking,
it was chaotic, it was dark.


77
0:5:49,3 --> 0:5:55,479
STARR (voice over): The shoes, just one clue
in the detective story that started 240 feet


78
0:5:55,479 --> 0:6:1,159
below the surface of the sea. Who were the
two men whose skeletons were found in the


79
0:6:1,159 --> 0:6:8,219
ship`s turret in 2002? The Navy is burying
them with full honors at Arlington National


80
0:6:8,219 --> 0:6:12,389
Cemetery, not knowing the answer yet.


81
0:6:12,389 --> 0:6:19,59
STARR: This is the 120 ton turret of the USS
Monitor. It`s seating in this water preservation


82
0:6:19,59 --> 0:6:27,36
tank right now. This is the precise spot were
they found the remains of the two Navy sailors.


83
0:6:27,36 --> 0:6:34,379
More clues, buttons from a uniform, a gold
ring, a comb, some coins. The Monitor itself


84
0:6:34,379 --> 0:6:41,56
made history as the first iron-clad ship,
caught in the storm of December 30th 1862


85
0:6:41,56 --> 0:6:48,159
off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, it flipped
over and sank. 16 sailors were lost.


86
0:6:48,159 --> 0:6:51,5
Captain Bobbie Scholley led Navy dives to
the wreckage.


87
0:6:51,5 --> 0:6:53,909
CAPT. BOBBIE SCHOLLEY (RET.), NAVY DIVE TEAM
COMMANDER: We needed to take all the appropriate


88
0:6:53,909 --> 0:6:59,52
steps necessary to recover those sailors with
all the honors and dignities.


89
0:6:59,52 --> 0:7:6,4
STARR: A military lab analyzed the bones.
DNA samples were taken, facial reconstructions


90
0:7:6,4 --> 0:7:13,159
were made. African-American sailors and officers
were eliminated. The remains were Caucasian.


91
0:7:13,159 --> 0:7:20,31
The buttons - not from officer`s coats. The
list is now down to five or six men, two possibilities


92
0:7:20,31 --> 0:7:25,749
- Robert Williams (ph) and William Ryan (ph).
Back at the water`s edge at Virginia, where


93
0:7:25,749 --> 0:7:32,449
the Monitor battled the Confederacy, the official
who oversees the ship`s legacy says it`s more


94
0:7:32,449 --> 0:7:33,199
than just history.


95
0:7:33,199 --> 0:7:38,539
DAVID ALBERG, NOAA: Whether it was 150 years
ago, or two weeks ago in Afghanistan, the


96
0:7:38,539 --> 0:7:43,349
nation`s commitment to bring her fallen home,
laying them to rest and returning them to


97
0:7:43,349 --> 0:7:49,8
the families stays as strong today as it ever
was. Barbara Starr, CNN, Newport News, Virginia.

99
0:7:50,37 --> 0:7:53,939
ANDRES: Teachers, don`t forget to tell us
what you think about today`s show- the feedback


100
0:7:53,939 --> 0:7:58,43
link is on our homepage. That`s also where
some students reply to our latest blog. We


101
0:7:58,43 --> 0:8:3,219
asked what you thought about women competing
in male-dominated sports. Bobby is all for


102
0:8:3,219 --> 0:8:7,46
it. "Women should have a chance to try and
show their talents." Claire thinks, "Girls


103
0:8:7,46 --> 0:8:12,99
competing in sports is OK, if the girls are
physically able to play them." But Scott says,


104
0:8:12,99 --> 0:8:16,529
"In sports like wrestling, with physical contact,
girls should have their own division."


105
0:8:16,529 --> 0:8:20,349
Scott might think differently when he hears
Danielle Coughlin`s story. She is a high school


106
0:8:20,349 --> 0:8:24,759
senior who loves to wrestle. When reporter
asked her about her competitive spirit, Danielle


107
0:8:24,759 --> 0:8:25,849
had a very humble response.


108

109
0:8:27,12 --> 0:8:32,82
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Would you rather be described
as like tough or intimidating or something


110
0:8:32,82 --> 0:8:33,5
like that?


111
0:8:33,5 --> 0:8:34,71
DANIELLE COUGHLIN, HIGH SCHOOL WRESTLING CHAMPION:
Just a hard worker, that`s all.


112
0:8:34,71 --> 0:8:38,76
ANDRES: Her hard work paid off, because Danielle
is a high school wrestling champ, and she


113
0:8:38,76 --> 0:8:43,1
didn`t get the title by competing against
other girls, she beat her all male opponents


114
0:8:43,1 --> 0:8:47,73
on the Massachusetts division Tuesday tournament,
Danielle is the first girl in the state`s


115
0:8:47,73 --> 0:8:52,3
history to win a wrestling title. Here is
how she described the moment.


116
0:8:52,3 --> 0:8:57,37
COUGHLIN: Definitely say it was probably the
moment in my life. And I`ll get my hand raised


117
0:8:57,37 --> 0:9:0,96
after that match and thinking that eight years
worth of hard work got me there.


118
0:9:0,96 --> 0:9:1,62
(END VIDEO CLIP)


119
0:9:1,62 --> 0:9:5,58
ANDRES: If you want to talk to Danielle about
her huge accomplishment, do you have a question


120
0:9:5,58 --> 0:9:11,12
you want to ask her? If so, you can tell us
on our Facebook or a blog or send us an iReport.


121
0:9:11,12 --> 0:9:15,23
Ever wished someone else could do your chores
for you? Apparently, it just takes some training.


122
0:9:15,23 --> 0:9:19,1
Jessie here can be an alarm clock, she can
fetch her owner a towel for the shower. She


123
0:9:19,1 --> 0:9:24,39
even does house work. Maybe not the most thorough
dusting, but still impressive. Youtube videos


124
0:9:24,39 --> 0:9:28,97
like this one have made Jessie a big hit.
She is eight years old, and I feel pretty


125
0:9:28,97 --> 0:9:32,29
sure she didn`t know how to do any of this
stuff as a puppy. So I guess you can teach


126
0:9:32,29 --> 0:9:36,62
an old dog new tricks. But don`t expect her
to do them right when you ask. After all,


127
0:9:36,62 --> 0:9:37,91
Jessie is a terrier.


128
0:9:37,91 --> 0:11:37,91
That`s where we pause for today. I`m Tommy
Andres. Have a great day.
