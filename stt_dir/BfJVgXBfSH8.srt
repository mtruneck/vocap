Mayday, this is UNSC FFG 201 Forward Unto Dawn requesting immediate evac.


3
0:0:27,0 --> 0:0:35,0
Survivors aboard, prioritization code Victor 05-3-00


4
0:0:35,0 --> 0:0:47,0
Mayday, this is UNSC FFG 201 Forward Unto Dawn requesting immediate evac. Survivors aboard…


5
0:0:47,0 --> 0:0:56,5
Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn Part I


6
0:0:56,5 --> 0:1:5,833
Mayday, this is UNSC FFG 201 Forward Unto Dawn requesting immediate evac. Survivors aboard…


7
0:1:5,833 --> 0:1:7,833
Locking onto frequency, tracking the coordinates.


8
0:1:7,833 --> 0:1:13,667



9
0:1:13,667 --> 0:1:15,0
Play it again, please.


10
0:1:15,0 --> 0:1:21,333
Mayday mayday mayday. This is UNSC FFG 201 Forward Unto Dawn requesting immediate evac. Survivors aboard…


11
0:1:21,333 --> 0:1:23,0
We have a lock.


12
0:1:23,0 --> 0:1:26,5
It's him! -Initiating protocol 117-alpha. All stations on deck!


13
0:1:26,5 --> 0:1:32,833



14
0:1:32,833 --> 0:1:33,667
Shall I play it again, sir?


15
0:1:33,667 --> 0:1:36,167



16
0:1:36,167 --> 0:1:37,0
Sir?


17
0:1:37,0 --> 0:1:39,167



18
0:1:39,167 --> 0:1:40,0
Commander Lasky?


19
0:1:40,0 --> 0:1:47,5



20
0:1:47,5 --> 0:1:49,5
Cryopods opening.


21
0:1:49,5 --> 0:1:57,0



22
0:1:57,0 --> 0:1:57,833
Lasky? You okay?


23
0:1:57,833 --> 0:2:2,5



24
0:2:2,5 --> 0:2:2,5
Are you alright?


25
0:2:2,5 --> 0:2:5,833



26
0:2:5,833 --> 0:2:7,5
Lasky, let's go!


27
0:2:7,5 --> 0:2:10,5



28
0:2:10,5 --> 0:2:12,5
Hastati Squad, four minutes to the rendezvous point.


29
0:2:12,5 --> 0:2:15,5
Copy, Vickers. Timer four minutes.


30
0:2:15,5 --> 0:2:17,5
Will you be able to shoot with those hands?


31
0:2:17,5 --> 0:2:19,5
We'll find out.


32
0:2:19,5 --> 0:2:20,833
Come on! -Axios!


33
0:2:20,833 --> 0:2:50,5



34
0:2:50,5 --> 0:2:56,0
Move it!


35
0:2:56,0 --> 0:2:58,167
Tchatkova, checkpoint.


36
0:2:58,167 --> 0:2:59,5
Chen, checkpoint.


37
0:2:59,5 --> 0:3:1,5
50 seconds


38
0:3:1,5 --> 0:3:2,5
Go!


39
0:3:2,5 --> 0:3:6,5



40
0:3:6,5 --> 0:3:7,167
Where are you guys?


41
0:3:7,167 --> 0:3:8,667
RV in 15 seconds.


42
0:3:8,667 --> 0:3:10,833
Ready?


43
0:3:10,833 --> 0:3:11,833
I'll see you at the party.


44
0:3:11,833 --> 0:3:19,0



45
0:3:19,0 --> 0:3:20,0
Sully!


46
0:3:20,0 --> 0:3:20,667
We have to leave him!


47
0:3:20,667 --> 0:3:21,5
Lasky, what the hell? -Come on!


48
0:3:21,5 --> 0:3:24,0
Lasky!


49
0:3:24,0 --> 0:3:26,5
Ten seconds!


50
0:3:26,5 --> 0:3:29,5



51
0:3:29,5 --> 0:3:30,5
Lasky, hurry it up!


52
0:3:30,5 --> 0:3:34,5
Landing in 3-2-1


53
0:3:34,5 --> 0:3:37,5
Enemy inbound. They'll be on us in 35 seconds.


54
0:3:37,5 --> 0:3:40,167
Fresh mags in your weapons, prepare to attack.


55
0:3:40,167 --> 0:3:40,667
Whst?


56
0:3:40,667 --> 0:3:47,0
Our objective is to neutralise the insurrectionists and acquire the target. We move on my mark.


57
0:3:47,0 --> 0:3:48,5
30 seconds.


58
0:3:48,5 --> 0:3:50,167
We should flank them a force a surrender.


59
0:3:50,167 --> 0:3:52,0
They're too close to flank! Innies never surrender.


60
0:3:52,0 --> 0:3:55,0
Dimah and I could circle around, there's still time.


61
0:3:55,0 --> 0:3:55,667
We can make it.


62
0:3:55,667 --> 0:3:56,5
25 seconds


63
0:3:56,5 --> 0:3:59,167
Guys.


64
0:3:59,167 --> 0:4:1,167
It's our best move.


65
0:4:1,167 --> 0:4:2,5
20 seconds


66
0:4:2,5 --> 0:4:5,0
No, we're sticking to my plan. ON MY MARK.


67
0:4:5,0 --> 0:4:5,5
It won't work.


68
0:4:5,5 --> 0:4:6,833
You're not in charge anymore, Lasky.


69
0:4:6,833 --> 0:4:8,5
Tom, just do what he says.


70
0:4:8,5 --> 0:4:10,5
15 seconds.


71
0:4:10,5 --> 0:4:11,667
Those are my orders.


72
0:4:11,667 --> 0:4:12,5
I don't care.


73
0:4:12,5 --> 0:4:13,5
10 seconds


74
0:4:13,5 --> 0:4:15,5



75
0:4:15,5 --> 0:4:17,833
5 seconds


76
0:4:17,833 --> 0:4:19,167
Axios!


77
0:4:19,167 --> 0:4:19,833
Lasky!


78
0:4:19,833 --> 0:4:45,5



79
0:4:45,5 --> 0:4:53,833
Hastati Squad leader on the field. Exercise paused.


80
0:4:53,833 --> 0:4:55,667
Let me guess, Lasky. You ignored orders.


81
0:4:55,667 --> 0:5:0,0
Just another strategic casualty, sir.


82
0:5:0,0 --> 0:5:2,5
Unacceptable.


83
0:5:2,5 --> 0:5:5,167



84
0:5:5,167 --> 0:5:6,0
Game over.


85
0:5:6,0 --> 0:5:12,5
Shoulder your weapon, cadet. Your little escapade kept Hastati Squad from achieving its objective.


86
0:5:12,5 --> 0:5:14,333



87
0:5:14,333 --> 0:5:15,5
Again.


88
0:5:15,5 --> 0:5:30,5



89
0:5:30,5 --> 0:5:36,5
Exercise complete. Zero wins, Hastati defaults.


90
0:5:36,5 --> 0:5:39,0



91
0:5:39,0 --> 0:5:40,0
Shit.


92
0:5:40,0 --> 0:5:54,5



93
0:5:54,5 --> 0:5:59,5
Robot tagged you?


94
0:5:59,5 --> 0:6:3,5
Once with two meters. Twice from one.


95
0:6:3,5 --> 0:6:6,5
I'm still numb from all the stun rounds.


96
0:6:6,5 --> 0:6:8,333
I'm always numb


97
0:6:8,333 --> 0:6:19,167



98
0:6:19,167 --> 0:6:25,167
Hastati, hold arms!


99
0:6:25,167 --> 0:6:31,167



100
0:6:31,167 --> 0:6:32,5
General Black, sir!


101
0:6:32,5 --> 0:6:37,167



102
0:6:37,167 --> 0:6:47,5
Let me remind you cadets: This academy bears the name of the Roman general Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo.


103
0:6:47,5 --> 0:6:54,5
Because he represents honour, valour, allegiance.


104
0:6:54,5 --> 0:7:1,5
General Corbulo was to take his own life in the name of the empire.


105
0:7:1,5 --> 0:7:5,5
Corbulo did not hesitate nor question.


106
0:7:5,5 --> 0:7:11,5
He loyally obeyed, screaming "Axios!" as he fell upon his own sword.


107
0:7:11,5 --> 0:7:21,167
Axios. I AM WORTHY.


108
0:7:21,167 --> 0:7:25,5
But I'm afraid, cadets, today you have proven to be anything but.


109
0:7:25,5 --> 0:7:33,0
We are at war with insurrectionists. Terrorists who would like nothing more than to see all of us dead.


110
0:7:33,0 --> 0:7:39,167
Had this been an actual Firefight the rebels would have likely killed every member of Hastati Squad.


111
0:7:39,167 --> 0:7:45,167



112
0:7:45,167 --> 0:7:54,5
Every single one of you at this academy was sent here because your parents are the upper eschelon of the United Nations Space Command.


113
0:7:54,5 --> 0:8:1,167
Because all of you are its future, and I expect you to act like it.


114
0:8:1,167 --> 0:8:4,0
Understood, sir!


115
0:8:4,0 --> 0:8:8,5
Well what are you waiting for? Lead them on tour, Orenski.


116
0:8:8,5 --> 0:8:12,5



117
0:8:12,5 --> 0:8:13,667
Axios!


118
0:8:13,667 --> 0:8:15,5
Axios!


119
0:8:15,5 --> 0:8:21,5
Hastati, right turn!


120
0:8:21,5 --> 0:8:23,5
Double ???


121
0:8:23,5 --> 0:8:47,5



122
0:8:47,5 --> 0:8:53,5
Corbulo Academy of Military Science Circinus-IV


123
0:8:53,5 --> 0:9:37,0



124
0:9:37,0 --> 0:9:40,5
Sully, do you ever stop talking?


125
0:9:40,5 --> 0:9:44,0
No, seriously. I'm on to something, here.


126
0:9:44,0 --> 0:9:48,5
The comms are messed up and I'm decoding something kick-ass.


127
0:9:48,5 --> 0:9:53,333
ONI's hiding stuff from us, I'm positive. They've got secrets, man.


128
0:9:53,333 --> 0:9:55,167
Stop stepping on our dicks, Lasky.


129
0:9:55,167 --> 0:9:57,0
Hey, ease up, Gingerbread.


130
0:9:57,0 --> 0:10:2,167
No, Sully. Vickers is right. My combat score sucked because of you.


131
0:10:2,167 --> 0:10:6,167
Don't bother, JJ. He's gone soft. He's an Innie-lover now.


132
0:10:6,167 --> 0:10:9,833
Dimah, that order didn't make any sense.


133
0:10:9,833 --> 0:10:12,5
Doesn't have to make sense. Just follow it.


134
0:10:12,5 --> 0:10:27,167



135
0:10:27,167 --> 0:10:29,5
I'm trying to survive here, okay?


136
0:10:29,5 --> 0:10:35,167
You need to respect the chain of command. The UNSC isn't the enemy. The Innies are.


137
0:10:35,167 --> 0:10:38,5
Spoken like a true believer.


138
0:10:38,5 --> 0:10:40,5
Yeah, well. At least I believe in something these days.


139
0:10:40,5 --> 0:10:43,667



140
0:10:43,667 --> 0:10:49,5
Cadet Thomas Lasky report to Colonel Mehaffey's office immediately.


141
0:10:49,5 --> 0:11:23,0



142
0:11:23,0 --> 0:11:25,167
No, we're sticking to my plan. ON MY MARK.


143
0:11:25,167 --> 0:0:2,5
It won't work.


144
0:0:2,5 --> 0:11:26,167
You're not in charge anymore, Lasky.


145
0:11:26,167 --> 0:0:2,5
Tom, just do what he says.


146
0:0:2,5 --> 0:11:28,167
15 seconds


147
0:11:28,167 --> 0:11:29,0
They're my orders.


148
0:11:29,0 --> 0:11:30,5
I don't care.


149
0:11:30,5 --> 0:11:31,5
Pause.


150
0:11:31,5 --> 0:11:34,333



151
0:11:34,333 --> 0:11:38,5
You don't care? You do realise your helmets transmit everything.


152
0:11:38,5 --> 0:11:40,167
No excuse, sir.


153
0:11:40,167 --> 0:11:44,167
You continue pulling down your squad, you're going to end up with a lot of enemies.


154
0:11:44,167 --> 0:11:44,5
Yes, sir!


155
0:11:44,5 --> 0:11:47,0



156
0:11:47,0 --> 0:11:53,833
I served under your mother and I know what she's like. And I sure as hell don't need to tell you that Colonel Lasky's not going to


157
0:11:53,833 --> 0:11:58,5
allow a son of hers to leave this academy without a diploma.


158
0:11:58,5 --> 0:12:4,167
I wouldn't know what my mother thinks, sir. I never see her.


159
0:12:4,167 --> 0:12:10,5
It's been a long war. Your mother holds a lot of hands.


160
0:12:10,5 --> 0:12:12,167
So I'm told, sir.


161
0:12:12,167 --> 0:12:17,5



162
0:12:17,5 --> 0:12:26,5
You know, Thomas, I've seen a lot of cadets come through here. Many have suffered like you.


163
0:12:26,5 --> 0:12:32,5
Pain like that can't be forgotten. But you can learn how to tolerate it.


164
0:12:32,5 --> 0:12:33,667
I'll do my best, sir.


165
0:12:33,667 --> 0:12:34,833
That will be all.


166
0:12:34,833 --> 0:12:43,833



167
0:12:43,833 --> 0:12:47,5
How long have you had those blisters?


168
0:12:47,5 --> 0:12:52,5
It's been on and off for a few weeks, but these are from yesterday.


169
0:12:52,5 --> 0:12:54,5
Any other symptoms?


170
0:12:54,5 --> 0:12:56,333
It's getting hard to breathe.


171
0:12:56,333 --> 0:12:59,5
Okay. Let's keep an eye on it. Cryo training can take its toll.


172
0:12:59,5 --> 0:13:59,5



173
0:13:59,5 --> 0:14:1,667
You really shouldn't be looking at that stuff, Sully.


174
0:14:1,667 --> 0:14:4,333



175
0:14:4,333 --> 0:14:5,167
Score.


176
0:14:5,167 --> 0:14:16,833



177
0:14:16,833 --> 0:14:28,5
"Your academic performance is exemplary. But your combat scores are disappointing."


178
0:14:28,5 --> 0:14:59,167



179
0:14:59,167 --> 0:15:5,5
Hey, little bro. Hello from Jericho 7. It's day 131 of deployment. So, I gotta show you something.


180
0:15:5,5 --> 0:15:7,5
Mom's gonna flip when she sees this. But whatever.


181
0:15:7,5 --> 0:15:14,833



182
0:15:14,833 --> 0:15:24,5
It's still a little raw. But we got a big drop on an innie stronghold next week, wanted to get it done before then. Anyways--


183
0:15:24,5 --> 0:15:26,5
So you haven't been court-marshalled yet, then?


184
0:15:26,5 --> 0:15:42,333



185
0:15:42,333 --> 0:15:43,333
I'm not apologizing.


186
0:15:43,333 --> 0:15:44,5
yes you are.


187
0:15:44,5 --> 0:15:46,0
At least I believe in something.


188
0:15:46,0 --> 0:15:47,167
I do believe in something.


189
0:15:47,167 --> 0:15:48,167
Yeah, so do I.


190
0:15:48,167 --> 0:15:50,5
Like what?


191
0:15:50,5 --> 0:15:55,167
Just not in stupid orders that lead to needless violence.


192
0:15:55,167 --> 0:15:57,333
Negotiating isn't an option anymore, Tom.


193
0:15:57,333 --> 0:16:3,333
So we're brainwashing kids and then sending them in to exterminate a bunch of overtaxed farmers.


194
0:16:3,333 --> 0:16:7,5
Farmers? That's who you think they are? You have no idea what the innies are like.


195
0:16:7,5 --> 0:16:11,0



196
0:16:11,0 --> 0:16:12,0
I have a pretty good idea.


197
0:16:12,0 --> 0:16:14,5



198
0:16:14,5 --> 0:16:23,833
Well then, you should know how much they hate us and that they're not going to stop fighting until we're all dead.


199
0:16:23,833 --> 0:16:27,0
Can you blame them?


200
0:16:27,0 --> 0:16:32,5
Yeah. I can. I blame them for a lot of things.


201
0:16:32,5 --> 0:16:36,5



202
0:16:36,5 --> 0:16:37,5
And you should, too.


203
0:16:37,5 --> 0:16:53,0



204
0:16:53,0 --> 0:17:1,833
I'm staying safe, doing my job. I just want you to do your job.


205
0:17:1,833 --> 0:17:6,833
Oh, an by the way, nice check mate, bro.


206
0:17:6,833 --> 0:17:9,0
Yet again.


207
0:17:9,0 --> 0:17:14,5
Okay. New game. It's your move.


208
0:17:14,5 --> 0:17:23,667
And hang in there. I know it's tough with mom being gone all the time. Being alone.


209
0:17:23,667 --> 0:17:27,0
She loves you, so do I.


210
0:17:27,0 --> 0:17:28,5
Miss you, buddy.


211
0:17:28,5 --> 0:17:35,167



212
0:17:35,167 --> 0:17:36,5
I miss you, too.


213
0:17:36,5 --> 0:17:40,0



214
0:17:40,0 --> 0:17:43,5
Lights out, doors closing.


215
0:17:43,5 --> 0:19:43,5
