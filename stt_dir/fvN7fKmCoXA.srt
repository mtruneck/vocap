RYAN: So we first met Nims
a few months ago.


8
0:1:13,15 --> 0:1:15,96
And after earning his trust for
a little while, he agreed


9
0:1:15,96 --> 0:1:17,52
to let us hang out with him.


10
0:1:17,52 --> 0:1:19,98
But for really obvious reasons,
a lot of the names


11
0:1:19,98 --> 0:1:21,52

see in this piece

hour of twists and turns down


15
0:2:3,73 --> 0:2:5,95
a whole bunch of streets we
didn't recognize, we finally


16
0:2:5,95 --> 0:2:8,0
arrived Nims' apartment.


17
0:2:8,0 --> 0:2:10,62
The walls are mostly bare, and
besides a bed and dresser and


18
0:2:10,62 --> 0:2:12,9
a big screen TV, it didn't
look like anyone actually


19
0:2:12,9 --> 0:2:14,15

NIMS: I could just
do it myself.


24
0:3:22,47 --> 0:4:10,33



25
0:4:10,33 --> 0:4:12,96
RYAN: At the age of 17, Nims
was arrested with a felony


26
0:4:12,96 --> 0:4:14,49
weight of cocaine.


27
0:4:14,49 --> 0:4:17,17
Just months before his 18th
birthday, he faced the


28
0:4:17,17 --> 0:4:19,38
possibility of a 20 year
prison sentence.


29
0:4:19,38 --> 0:5:0,36

31
0:5:1,286 --> 0:5:15,867



32
0:5:15,867 --> 0:5:17,22
NIMS: It was three
years in jail or


33
0:5:17,22 --> 0:5:18,22
take the SHOCK program.

They tell you when to eat.

0:5:42,41 --> 0:5:43,84
They tell you how to
do everything.


39
0:5:43,84 --> 0:5:46,39
Probably worse than a
military boot camp.


40
0:5:46,39 --> 0:5:57,54



41
0:5:57,54 --> 0:5:58,83
I wound up doing four months.

before you do, you're going to

You got to sacrifice.

the volume of calls is Nims


53
0:9:59,82 --> 0:10:2,7
receives each day has
grown exponentially.

0:10:2,7 --> 0:10:5,58
After months of working 12 to
15 hour shifts, seven days a


55
0:10:5,58 --> 0:10:8,36
week, and with numerous failed
attempts, he eventually put


56
0:10:8,36 --> 0:10:10,35
together a reliable crew.


57
0:10:10,35 --> 0:10:13,2
After a quick call, he invited
us back to the stash house to


58
0:10:13,2 --> 0:10:14,42
meet one of them.

0:10:14,42 --> 0:10:26,76

0:10:26,76 --> 0:10:28,97
RYAN: When we arrived at Nims'
stash house, we were surprised


61
0:10:28,97 --> 0:10:30,4
to find Mild.


62
0:10:30,4 --> 0:10:32,27
He was a crew member that we had
met on a previous shoot,


63
0:10:32,27 --> 0:10:34,15
but we knew he had just
been arrested.


64
0:10:34,15 --> 0:10:37,26
He told us all about how Nims
had covered his bail, and even


65
0:10:37,26 --> 0:10:39,51
brought in his own very
expensive lawyer to get Mild's

0:10:39,51 --> 0:10:40,77

believe that the volume of

product that Nims was
distributing each week could


73
0:11:21,38 --> 0:11:23,57

the nose of the NYPD.

$2,400 to make a

erupt into a full on beef
