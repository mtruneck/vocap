1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:7,59



2
0:0:7,59 --> 0:0:10,28
JF MUSIAL: McLaren is a brand
synonymous with motor racing.


3
0:0:10,28 --> 0:0:12,26
Formula One is the most
obvious connection.


4
0:0:12,26 --> 0:0:14,6
But McLaren was also involved
with Can-Am


5
0:0:14,6 --> 0:0:16,9
racing as well as IndyCar.


6
0:0:16,9 --> 0:0:19,6
Founded in 1963 by Bruce
McLaren, a former racer


7
0:0:19,6 --> 0:0:22,24
himself, it's one of the few
brands in the world that


8
0:0:22,24 --> 0:0:25,237
invests itself so heavily
into racing.


9
0:0:25,237 --> 0:1:19,49



10
0:1:19,49 --> 0:1:21,32
JOHN ALLERT: It wouldn't
surprise you to know when you


11
0:1:21,32 --> 0:1:25,26
come to a building like this
that everything we do is about


12
0:1:25,26 --> 0:1:26,44
attention to detail.


13
0:1:26,44 --> 0:1:29,95
But it's not just attention to
detail for detail's sake.


14
0:1:29,95 --> 0:1:32,64
It's always with an
objective in mind.


15
0:1:32,64 --> 0:1:36,28
And 9 times out of 10, that
objective is winning.


16
0:1:36,28 --> 0:1:39,67
We have other businesses where
winning isn't necessarily


17
0:1:39,67 --> 0:1:42,12
being first across the line--
it's about being the best.


18
0:1:42,12 --> 0:1:45,3
But at the end of the day,
everything we do is about


19
0:1:45,3 --> 0:1:48,506
being better than our peers,
better than our competitors.


20
0:1:48,506 --> 0:1:49,84
JF MUSIAL: I have
to ask though.


21
0:1:49,84 --> 0:1:52,95
You look at Bruce McLaren's
vision and


22
0:1:52,95 --> 0:1:55,19
actually what Ron Dennis--


23
0:1:55,19 --> 0:1:58,97
how has McLaren transpired at
after all these years to be


24
0:1:58,97 --> 0:2:2,2
what it is, from those
initial idea?


25
0:2:2,2 --> 0:2:4,41
JOHN ALLERT: I think it's
because it's the shared value


26
0:2:4,41 --> 0:2:7,58
systems that Bruce had
and that Bruce


27
0:2:7,58 --> 0:2:9,6
imparted on his team.


28
0:2:9,6 --> 0:2:12,51
And then when Ron took over,
he had very much those same


29
0:2:12,51 --> 0:2:14,9
values, but then just took them
to a whole new level, was


30
0:2:14,9 --> 0:2:18,43
able to bring in greater
finance.


31
0:2:18,43 --> 0:2:21,58
And that gave us the muscle to
then develop that vision and


32
0:2:21,58 --> 0:2:23,6
take it into other areas.


33
0:2:23,6 --> 0:2:25,64
JF MUSIAL: What I love, though,
is that you stay close


34
0:2:25,64 --> 0:2:27,75
to your racing history.


35
0:2:27,75 --> 0:2:28,34
This is incredible.


36
0:2:28,34 --> 0:2:29,516
JOHN ALLERT: Well, how
can we not stay close


37
0:2:29,516 --> 0:2:30,2
to our racing history?


38
0:2:30,2 --> 0:2:32,94
I mean, our racing history
is phenomenal.


39
0:2:32,94 --> 0:2:37,81
And we've won 1 in 4 of every
Formula One race we've ever


40
0:2:37,81 --> 0:2:38,33
competed in.


41
0:2:38,33 --> 0:2:39,3
JF MUSIAL: Unheard of.


42
0:2:39,3 --> 0:2:42,14
JOHN ALLERT: We've been on the
podium for 50% of every race


43
0:2:42,14 --> 0:2:43,14
we've ever competed in.


44
0:2:43,14 --> 0:2:46,65
So it's a pedigree and a
heritage that we are obviously


45
0:2:46,65 --> 0:2:47,74
very proud of.


46
0:2:47,74 --> 0:2:50,4
We're not an extrovert business,
but we feel very,


47
0:2:50,4 --> 0:2:54,14
very proud inwardly
of that success.


48
0:2:54,14 --> 0:2:57,24
And it's that success that
inspires the current


49
0:2:57,24 --> 0:3:0,255
generation of people at McLaren
to try and take it to


50
0:3:0,255 --> 0:3:0,96
another level.


51
0:3:0,96 --> 0:3:3,21
How do people feel about
all of this heritage?


52
0:3:3,21 --> 0:3:4,33
JF MUSIAL: Yeah.


53
0:3:4,33 --> 0:3:5,43
JOHN ALLERT: They feel
enriched by it.


54
0:3:5,43 --> 0:3:7,17
You can't help but feel
inspired by it.


55
0:3:7,17 --> 0:3:8,77
And it's one of the key
reasons that we


56
0:3:8,77 --> 0:3:11,27
have it all on display.


57
0:3:11,27 --> 0:3:13,55
Your reaction when you walked
in here is no different than


58
0:3:13,55 --> 0:3:14,47
anybody's reaction.


59
0:3:14,47 --> 0:3:17,41
Which is, wow, there's a Senna
car, or there's a Prost car,


60
0:3:17,41 --> 0:3:18,55
or whatever it is.


61
0:3:18,55 --> 0:3:20,76
Everybody has their particular
era that


62
0:3:20,76 --> 0:3:23,17
they get excited about.


63
0:3:23,17 --> 0:3:26,61
And for me just as one person,
to actually see some of the


64
0:3:26,61 --> 0:3:29,43
cars here every day that I've
actually stood on the other


65
0:3:29,43 --> 0:3:32,22
side of the wire from
when I was 12 or 13


66
0:3:32,22 --> 0:3:35,6
years old, I get tingles.


67
0:3:35,6 --> 0:3:37,29
I get goosebumps just
thinking about it.


68
0:3:37,29 --> 0:3:40,335
We've had people break down in
tears seeing some of the cars


69
0:3:40,335 --> 0:3:42,4
that you've walked past today.


70
0:3:42,4 --> 0:3:45,14
JF MUSIAL: Walking into the MTC,
it's as if you're walking


71
0:3:45,14 --> 0:3:47,64
into a science fiction movie--


72
0:3:47,64 --> 0:3:50,73
long corridors with highly
metallic surfaces.


73
0:3:50,73 --> 0:3:53,18
You walk through hallways
thinking Trent Reznor should


74
0:3:53,18 --> 0:3:56,0
score a soundtrack for all the
guests to listen to as they


75
0:3:56,0 --> 0:3:58,6
enter the place for
the first time.


76
0:3:58,6 --> 0:3:59,52
Everything is spotless.


77
0:3:59,52 --> 0:4:0,45
Everything is clean.


78
0:4:0,45 --> 0:4:2,74
You can tell everything is
designed obsessively.


79
0:4:2,74 --> 0:4:5,4
And I'm not saying that
in a cold way.


80
0:4:5,4 --> 0:4:8,18
In fact, the architecture allows
for so much natural


81
0:4:8,18 --> 0:4:12,37
light into the work spaces it
makes you feel awake, alive.


82
0:4:12,37 --> 0:4:15,26
JOHN ALLERT: This building was a
vision conceived in the kind


83
0:4:15,26 --> 0:4:16,16
of mid to late '90s.


84
0:4:16,16 --> 0:4:17,64
JF MUSIAL: OK.


85
0:4:17,64 --> 0:4:20,899
JOHN ALLERT: Ron Dennis always
wanted to bring the kind of


86
0:4:20,899 --> 0:4:23,67
the federation of companies
together under one roof.


87
0:4:23,67 --> 0:4:28,6
We'd grown exponentially over
a period of 20, 25 years.


88
0:4:28,6 --> 0:4:32,81
And we really were wanting the
benefits of being back as one


89
0:4:32,81 --> 0:4:33,4
kind of collective.


90
0:4:33,4 --> 0:4:34,57
JF MUSIAL: Mm-hmm.


91
0:4:34,57 --> 0:4:38,17
JOHN ALLERT: We then wanted a
showpiece both for commercial


92
0:4:38,17 --> 0:4:40,91
reasons, so that we could
explain to people the vision


93
0:4:40,91 --> 0:4:44,1
of what we're all about and
hopefully elicit their


94
0:4:44,1 --> 0:4:47,72
investment in us either as
sponsors, or partners, or in


95
0:4:47,72 --> 0:4:50,55
some cases, investors, but
also to make sure that we


96
0:4:50,55 --> 0:4:53,56
could recruit the best people,
and get the best people to


97
0:4:53,56 --> 0:4:55,9
come and share in what it was
that we were trying to build.


98
0:4:55,9 --> 0:4:58,91
And this facility really
does inspire the


99
0:4:58,91 --> 0:5:0,53
people who work here.


100
0:5:0,53 --> 0:5:3,85
And I think that Ron really was
ahead of time in creating


101
0:5:3,85 --> 0:5:6,9
something that people would just
want to be in, want to be


102
0:5:6,9 --> 0:5:9,97
part of, as well as well
as the success of


103
0:5:9,97 --> 0:5:11,38
the business itself.


104
0:5:11,38 --> 0:5:13,81
To actually come to a
place like this is--


105
0:5:13,81 --> 0:5:16,77
it's an awe-inspiring
environment in which to work.


106
0:5:16,77 --> 0:5:19,18
And it's a little like
going on stage.


107
0:5:19,18 --> 0:5:21,53
You really feel like you have
to up your game when you


108
0:5:21,53 --> 0:5:23,14
arrive here every morning.


109
0:5:23,14 --> 0:5:26,5
JF MUSIAL: It is an inviting
experience, which makes sense.


110
0:5:26,5 --> 0:5:28,24
The MTC opened in 2003.


111
0:5:28,24 --> 0:5:31,44
And Ron Dennis was very
influential in its design.


112
0:5:31,44 --> 0:5:33,9
Inside, you not only have
McLaren Racing but also


113
0:5:33,9 --> 0:5:36,85
McLaren Automotive and the
not so well known McLaren


114
0:5:36,85 --> 0:5:38,62
Electronics.


115
0:5:38,62 --> 0:5:42,43
Walking in here, you look at
this, this is not what I was


116
0:5:42,43 --> 0:5:43,42
expecting at all.


117
0:5:43,42 --> 0:5:44,105
JOHN ALLERT: No, this looks--


118
0:5:44,105 --> 0:5:44,82
JF MUSIAL: This looks like
a scientific laboratory.


119
0:5:44,82 --> 0:5:45,89
JOHN ALLERT: I was just going
to say it looks like a


120
0:5:45,89 --> 0:5:46,2
laboratory.


121
0:5:46,2 --> 0:5:47,18
But it's not.


122
0:5:47,18 --> 0:5:48,99
This is part of McLaren
Electronics.


123
0:5:48,99 --> 0:5:49,36
JF MUSIAL: Got it.


124
0:5:49,36 --> 0:5:52,28
JOHN ALLERT: So this is where
ECUs are actually being


125
0:5:52,28 --> 0:5:53,895
physically created.


126
0:5:53,895 --> 0:5:56,94
I mean, we're printing circuit
boards in there.


127
0:5:56,94 --> 0:5:58,49
That's high-end stuff.


128
0:5:58,49 --> 0:5:59,82
It's not the sexy end
of the business.


129
0:5:59,82 --> 0:6:1,7
But it's very high-end.


130
0:6:1,7 --> 0:6:3,49
JF MUSIAL: Ron Dennis wanted
the building to attract the


131
0:6:3,49 --> 0:6:4,97
best engineers and designers.


132
0:6:4,97 --> 0:6:8,4
But more importantly, he wanted
to keep them there.


133
0:6:8,4 --> 0:6:10,68
Walking the hallways, you can
tell everyone who works there


134
0:6:10,68 --> 0:6:14,45
has a sense of pride to be
working within those walls.


135
0:6:14,45 --> 0:6:16,96
JOHN ALLERT: It's actually--
it's a very selfless culture.


136
0:6:16,96 --> 0:6:20,69
I think we attract like-minded
people here who ultimately


137
0:6:20,69 --> 0:6:23,94
want to win and what to do the
best they can possibly do in


138
0:6:23,94 --> 0:6:25,22
whatever role they have.


139
0:6:25,22 --> 0:6:27,4
But they're selfless people
who want to come


140
0:6:27,4 --> 0:6:28,76
together as a team.


141
0:6:28,76 --> 0:6:32,37
And understand that actually
the old cliche of 1 plus 1


142
0:6:32,37 --> 0:6:35,19
equals 3, that if they can all
come together and be the best


143
0:6:35,19 --> 0:6:37,37
in their particular discipline,
chances are that


144
0:6:37,37 --> 0:6:39,485
we're more likely to
succeed or to win.


145
0:6:39,485 --> 0:6:41,19
And we have a lot
to live up to.


146
0:6:41,19 --> 0:6:44,24
We have 49 years of success.


147
0:6:44,24 --> 0:6:46,51
In the time that we've been in
Formula One, for example,


148
0:6:46,51 --> 0:6:48,7
there have been over
100 Formula


149
0:6:48,7 --> 0:6:49,7
One teams have failed--


150
0:6:49,7 --> 0:6:52,11
have come and gone,
left Formula One.


151
0:6:52,11 --> 0:6:55,47
So this is no place for
the weak or the meek.


152
0:6:55,47 --> 0:6:59,59
And we're reminded of those
sorts of statistics every year


153
0:6:59,59 --> 0:7:2,76
when people either leave the
automotive sector or they


154
0:7:2,76 --> 0:7:5,2
leave Formula One.


155
0:7:5,2 --> 0:7:8,46
And that's part of that pressure
to make sure that


156
0:7:8,46 --> 0:7:9,91
we're being the best.


157
0:7:9,91 --> 0:7:11,61
Because it's a slippery pole.


158
0:7:11,61 --> 0:7:13,5
Either in supercars
or in Formula One,


159
0:7:13,5 --> 0:7:14,18
it's a slippery pole.


160
0:7:14,18 --> 0:7:16,96
And those that aren't near the
top have a real struggle.


161
0:7:16,96 --> 0:7:18,22
[INAUDIBLE]


162
0:7:18,22 --> 0:7:20,91
JF MUSIAL: Now, past the wind
tunnel and the Formula One


163
0:7:20,91 --> 0:7:24,82
work bays, we walk down a long
hallway, all underground, very


164
0:7:24,82 --> 0:7:26,9
James Bond-like.


165
0:7:26,9 --> 0:7:28,35
You then hit a set of stairs.


166
0:7:28,35 --> 0:7:29,4
You go up.


167
0:7:29,4 --> 0:7:31,24
And then you walk into
what is called the


168
0:7:31,24 --> 0:7:33,5
McLaren Production Center.


169
0:7:33,5 --> 0:7:35,14
This is McLaren Automotive.


170
0:7:35,14 --> 0:7:37,4
This is the future of McLaren.


171
0:7:37,4 --> 0:7:41,3
LEE BOYCE: So right now, this
is the north end of the MPC.


172
0:7:41,3 --> 0:7:42,6
This is a VIP area.


173
0:7:42,6 --> 0:7:43,19
This is a hosting suite.


174
0:7:43,19 --> 0:7:45,24
So this is basically where
potential customers, or


175
0:7:45,24 --> 0:7:48,87
dignitaries, or any type of
VIP can come to this area.


176
0:7:48,87 --> 0:7:52,7
And from this area, we lead
directly out onto the


177
0:7:52,7 --> 0:7:54,155
production facility, just
around this corner here.


178
0:7:54,155 --> 0:7:54,48
JF MUSIAL: OK.


179
0:7:54,48 --> 0:7:55,435
LEE BOYCE: And I think
you need to see that.


180
0:7:55,435 --> 0:7:56,942
JF MUSIAL: Let's go
check it out.


181
0:7:56,942 --> 0:7:58,75
So how old is this place?


182
0:7:58,75 --> 0:8:0,975
LEE BOYCE: So we've been
operating in here now for--


183
0:8:0,975 --> 0:8:1,14
JF MUSIAL: Whoa!


184
0:8:1,14 --> 0:8:1,31
Look at this!


185
0:8:1,31 --> 0:8:2,56
LEE BOYCE: --eight months.


186
0:8:2,56 --> 0:8:25,608



187
0:8:25,608 --> 0:8:27,81
JF MUSIAL: And you're in full
production at this point.


188
0:8:27,81 --> 0:8:27,96
That is incredible.


189
0:8:27,96 --> 0:8:29,51
LEE BOYCE: We are flat-out
production.


190
0:8:29,51 --> 0:8:34,179
And we have been now since
the turn of the year.


191
0:8:34,179 --> 0:8:37,549
We have been at full capacity
in terms of our planning


192
0:8:37,549 --> 0:8:38,951
requirements for this year.


193
0:8:38,951 --> 0:8:43,265
And for sure, everything, from
a production point of view is


194
0:8:43,265 --> 0:8:44,207
going absolutely beautifully
at this moment.


195
0:8:44,207 --> 0:8:45,73
JF MUSIAL: This is surreal.


196
0:8:45,73 --> 0:8:46,25
LEE BOYCE: Yes.


197
0:8:46,25 --> 0:8:46,73
JF MUSIAL: It's almost
a [INAUDIBLE] room.


198
0:8:46,73 --> 0:8:50,16
And it mimics the MTC but
on a different level.


199
0:8:50,16 --> 0:8:53,67
Prior to the MP4-12C, McLaren
built my favorite hypercar,


200
0:8:53,67 --> 0:8:57,16
the F1, then after that, the
SLR, which was built right


201
0:8:57,16 --> 0:8:58,39
alongside the F1 cars.


202
0:8:58,39 --> 0:9:3,22
But now, for the new MP4-12C,
it's an entirely new building.


203
0:9:3,22 --> 0:9:5,31
The first thing I noticed there
was that there was a lot


204
0:9:5,31 --> 0:9:6,17
of unused space.


205
0:9:6,17 --> 0:9:8,14
McLaren has been around
for about 50 years.


206
0:9:8,14 --> 0:9:10,31
But McLaren Automotive
is essentially an


207
0:9:10,31 --> 0:9:11,88
entirely new company.


208
0:9:11,88 --> 0:9:14,51
They built the McLaren
Production Center knowing they


209
0:9:14,51 --> 0:9:18,48
would be building other models
besides the MP4-12C.


210
0:9:18,48 --> 0:9:20,95
LEE BOYCE: Actually, what you're
looking at now is the


211
0:9:20,95 --> 0:9:25,25
best part of 20,000 square
meters of floor space on which


212
0:9:25,25 --> 0:9:26,72
we want to produce
the vehicle.


213
0:9:26,72 --> 0:9:29,41
We worked really hard to make
sure that we could integrate


214
0:9:29,41 --> 0:9:32,38
all of the processes that were
absolutely critical to


215
0:9:32,38 --> 0:9:37,2
ensuring that the assembly of
this vehicle was felt on


216
0:9:37,2 --> 0:9:39,52
absolute personal level from an
operator's point of view,


217
0:9:39,52 --> 0:9:41,81
but also gave the customer a
really good feeling that


218
0:9:41,81 --> 0:9:43,98
actually, his ownership
experience didn't start when


219
0:9:43,98 --> 0:9:44,775
he took the car.


220
0:9:44,775 --> 0:9:47,1
It actually started at the
placement of order.


221
0:9:47,1 --> 0:9:48,93
And therefore, if he wanted to
visit this facility, he could


222
0:9:48,93 --> 0:9:50,94
actually come and see his
vehicle being birthed.


223
0:9:50,94 --> 0:9:53,0
All of the technicians feel as
though they're involved in


224
0:9:53,0 --> 0:9:54,36
making that person's car.


225
0:9:54,36 --> 0:9:56,3
So it's not just a vehicle.


226
0:9:56,3 --> 0:9:59,27
They accept that there behind
that is a customer, and a


227
0:9:59,27 --> 0:10:0,29
valued customer.


228
0:10:0,29 --> 0:10:3,4
And we wanted to make sure that
his ownership experience


229
0:10:3,4 --> 0:10:6,3
started right here from the
moment we first loaded any


230
0:10:6,3 --> 0:10:7,76
components into the facility.


231
0:10:7,76 --> 0:10:9,28
If we keep taking a
look down here--


232
0:10:9,28 --> 0:10:10,94
JF MUSIAL: So this is
Phase 1 right here.


233
0:10:10,94 --> 0:10:12,15
LEE BOYCE: So this
is absolutely the


234
0:10:12,15 --> 0:10:12,8
start of the process.


235
0:10:12,8 --> 0:10:13,8
JF MUSIAL: OK.


236
0:10:13,8 --> 0:10:16,8
So this is the MP4-12C
monococque right here.


237
0:10:16,8 --> 0:10:18,32
LEE BOYCE: We didn't want any
feel of industrialization in


238
0:10:18,32 --> 0:10:20,89
the facility.


239
0:10:20,89 --> 0:10:22,36
We wanted it to be a theater.


240
0:10:22,36 --> 0:10:23,13
JF MUSIAL: [CHUCKLES]


241
0:10:23,13 --> 0:10:24,875
LEE BOYCE: It was really
important to us that we create


242
0:10:24,875 --> 0:10:28,29
an environment where everything
felt special and


243
0:10:28,29 --> 0:10:29,745
everything felt personal.


244
0:10:29,745 --> 0:10:31,3
And I think we've
achieved that.


245
0:10:31,3 --> 0:10:33,94
So what you don't see is you
don't see any significant


246
0:10:33,94 --> 0:10:34,89
levels of automation.


247
0:10:34,89 --> 0:10:36,15
You don't see clunking--


248
0:10:36,15 --> 0:10:36,75
JF MUSIAL: You almost
see none.


249
0:10:36,75 --> 0:10:37,11
LEE BOYCE: --chains.


250
0:10:37,11 --> 0:10:38,57
You don't see any conveyors.


251
0:10:38,57 --> 0:10:40,71
You won't see air lines
or anything like this.


252
0:10:40,71 --> 0:10:42,355
It's all very quiet.


253
0:10:42,355 --> 0:10:44,85
It's all very composed.


254
0:10:44,85 --> 0:10:46,77
And it's all very simple
in its execution.


255
0:10:46,77 --> 0:10:49,98
If we take a look at some of the
racking and what have you,


256
0:10:49,98 --> 0:10:51,61
there are a number of components
such as fastenings


257
0:10:51,61 --> 0:10:53,47
and such as brackets and that
where we can clearly hold


258
0:10:53,47 --> 0:10:56,12
quite a decent level of stock
holding lineside.


259
0:10:56,12 --> 0:10:59,205
And as you can see with things
like these front long


260
0:10:59,205 --> 0:11:2,7
[INAUDIBLE], we've designed
some bespoke stillaging to


261
0:11:2,7 --> 0:11:2,31
allow us to--


262
0:11:2,31 --> 0:11:3,28
JF MUSIAL: Just for
these parts?


263
0:11:3,28 --> 0:11:4,51
LEE BOYCE: Just for these
particular parts.


264
0:11:4,51 --> 0:11:6,925
And we have bespoke stillaging
all around the facility.


265
0:11:6,925 --> 0:11:11,46
But I think what's a really
good, tactile thing about what


266
0:11:11,46 --> 0:11:15,62
you're looking at right now is
if you look at the diameter


267
0:11:15,62 --> 0:11:19,86
and the radius of the bespoke
stillaging, it's absolutely


268
0:11:19,86 --> 0:11:24,28
the same as the radius and the
diameter of the racking.


269
0:11:24,28 --> 0:11:26,86
As you could see, this is where
the vehicle's being more


270
0:11:26,86 --> 0:11:29,17
and more progressed through
its build assembly phase.


271
0:11:29,17 --> 0:11:30,856
So the windscreen surround
is going on there.


272
0:11:30,856 --> 0:11:32,93
And the B-pillar carting
is going on here.


273
0:11:32,93 --> 0:11:37,36
So even though we have 100%
confidence in the facilities,


274
0:11:37,36 --> 0:11:38,99
and the equipment,
and the whole


275
0:11:38,99 --> 0:11:41,126
process with these guys--


276
0:11:41,126 --> 0:11:42,93
and we are 100% confident--


277
0:11:42,93 --> 0:11:46,3
that doesn't stop us taking
every single body, and it is


278
0:11:46,3 --> 0:11:50,28
every single body, and
processing them into the


279
0:11:50,28 --> 0:11:53,622
Geometric and Surface
Validation station.


280
0:11:53,622 --> 0:12:7,76



281
0:12:7,76 --> 0:12:10,29
So this is Geometric and
Surface Validation.


282
0:12:10,29 --> 0:12:12,9
So basically, every
single body--


283
0:12:12,9 --> 0:12:15,0
even though we're 100% confident
it's in a good


284
0:12:15,0 --> 0:12:18,5
place, we still want to measure
it just to ensure that


285
0:12:18,5 --> 0:12:23,76
we don't get any quality drift
in the overall body's vehicle


286
0:12:23,76 --> 0:12:25,8
assembly status.


287
0:12:25,8 --> 0:12:27,12
JF MUSIAL: So this whole rig
here is just for measurement.


288
0:12:27,12 --> 0:12:29,5
LEE BOYCE: So everything that
you're seeing here is


289
0:12:29,5 --> 0:12:30,31
absolutely for measurement.


290
0:12:30,31 --> 0:12:32,21
So if we take a lot
of surface points.


291
0:12:32,21 --> 0:12:33,23
We take hundreds of
surface points.


292
0:12:33,23 --> 0:12:36,69
We take hundreds of geometric
points on the vehicle to


293
0:12:36,69 --> 0:12:39,6
ensure that we know that the car
is in a really good place


294
0:12:39,6 --> 0:12:40,926
dimensionally.


295
0:12:40,926 --> 0:12:43,18
The body would exit these
double doors here.


296
0:12:43,18 --> 0:12:43,88
JF MUSIAL: Got it.


297
0:12:43,88 --> 0:12:45,176
LEE BOYCE: Which are closed
at the moment.


298
0:12:45,176 --> 0:12:49,37
Then it will go into-- this
is the paint facility now.


299
0:12:49,37 --> 0:12:51,68
In essence, the vehicle through
this paint facility is


300
0:12:51,68 --> 0:12:53,36
processed across two skids.


301
0:12:53,36 --> 0:12:55,93
The body goes on one particular
skid and all of the


302
0:12:55,93 --> 0:12:59,32
other supplementary panels
go onto another.


303
0:12:59,32 --> 0:13:2,94
This is the single biggest piece
of investment in terms


304
0:13:2,94 --> 0:13:5,262
of equipment in the
whole of MPC.


305
0:13:5,262 --> 0:13:8,852
And so we've pushed all of
the potential suppliers--


306
0:13:8,852 --> 0:13:10,1
with regard to paint
facilities--


307
0:13:10,1 --> 0:13:13,23
hard in terms of making sure
that in their thinking,


308
0:13:13,23 --> 0:13:15,662
they've got absolutely what we
were all about in terms of an


309
0:13:15,662 --> 0:13:16,9
installation.


310
0:13:16,9 --> 0:13:17,98
So whilst all of them could
have satisfied us


311
0:13:17,98 --> 0:13:18,7
technically--


312
0:13:18,7 --> 0:13:19,87
that's not a problem--


313
0:13:19,87 --> 0:13:22,43
we wanted to make sure that
this was right as well.


314
0:13:22,43 --> 0:13:24,41
This was really important for
us to make sure that they


315
0:13:24,41 --> 0:13:28,27
understood our philosophies,
our methodologies, and they


316
0:13:28,27 --> 0:13:31,3
clearly understand that from a
brand augmentation point of


317
0:13:31,3 --> 0:13:34,13
view, whatever they install
absolutely complemented them.


318
0:13:34,13 --> 0:13:36,97
Because what it creates is it
creates a completely different


319
0:13:36,97 --> 0:13:39,37
mindset of thinking for
the technician.


320
0:13:39,37 --> 0:13:41,42
What it demonstrates to the
technician is that we've


321
0:13:41,42 --> 0:13:44,52
thought about their working
environment as much as we have


322
0:13:44,52 --> 0:13:46,25
the product and the customer.


323
0:13:46,25 --> 0:13:48,3
Because if we create a perfect
work environment for them,


324
0:13:48,3 --> 0:13:51,59
they can only ever give their
best of themselves.


325
0:13:51,59 --> 0:13:54,54
And I actually think you get
that natural transfer into the


326
0:13:54,54 --> 0:13:54,9
vehicle there.


327
0:13:54,9 --> 0:13:56,61
And you get an uplift
of in-built


328
0:13:56,61 --> 0:13:58,15
vehicle processing quality.


329
0:13:58,15 --> 0:14:0,21
I'm absolutely convinced
of that.


330
0:14:0,21 --> 0:14:2,605
So what you're seeing here
now is worth seeing.


331
0:14:2,605 --> 0:14:5,26



332
0:14:5,26 --> 0:14:7,0
This is what we call Skid 2.


333
0:14:7,0 --> 0:14:8,81
And it's just had its
base coat applied.


334
0:14:8,81 --> 0:14:12,31
That won't go forward until
they put the clear coat on


335
0:14:12,31 --> 0:14:13,63
those particular booths here.


336
0:14:13,63 --> 0:14:16,79
The whole facility-- even
though we designed the


337
0:14:16,79 --> 0:14:19,15
facility such that if
we wanted to put


338
0:14:19,15 --> 0:14:21,15
robots in here, we could.


339
0:14:21,15 --> 0:14:23,83
And whilst robots have
got great dexterity--


340
0:14:23,83 --> 0:14:25,93
and they have-- and you can put
all sorts of convoluted


341
0:14:25,93 --> 0:14:29,35
and complicated programs into
them, there's nothing more


342
0:14:29,35 --> 0:14:30,92
dexterous than the human.


343
0:14:30,92 --> 0:14:33,66
And what a robot doesn't have
as well, he doesn't have the


344
0:14:33,66 --> 0:14:36,1
eye as well.


345
0:14:36,1 --> 0:14:37,75
It's an application process.


346
0:14:37,75 --> 0:14:39,29
There's nothing emotional
about it.


347
0:14:39,29 --> 0:14:40,555
It's very clinical.


348
0:14:40,555 --> 0:14:43,8
It's just application.


349
0:14:43,8 --> 0:14:46,99
Here, these guys can take a
view on when they think


350
0:14:46,99 --> 0:14:48,15
they've done something
absolutely the


351
0:14:48,15 --> 0:14:48,885
right way or not.


352
0:14:48,885 --> 0:14:52,9
And they've got an opportunity
to do a level of reparation in


353
0:14:52,9 --> 0:14:54,3
the booth should a mistake have
been made or should they


354
0:14:54,3 --> 0:14:56,812
see something on the vehicle,
then they think, oh, that


355
0:14:56,812 --> 0:14:59,8
doesn't look quite right,
there's an opportunity here to


356
0:14:59,8 --> 0:15:0,44
do that reparation.


357
0:15:0,44 --> 0:15:1,17
So [INAUDIBLE]


358
0:15:1,17 --> 0:15:2,64
this is an audit line.


359
0:15:2,64 --> 0:15:5,46
And so basically, when the
vehicle has had its clear coat


360
0:15:5,46 --> 0:15:7,6
put on, it goes into
the oven through


361
0:15:7,6 --> 0:15:7,78
those glass doors there.


362
0:15:7,78 --> 0:15:9,1
There's exits here.


363
0:15:9,1 --> 0:15:11,12
And this is the first point
we do some inspection.


364
0:15:11,12 --> 0:15:13,95
Every single vehicle gets
a full surface quality


365
0:15:13,95 --> 0:15:14,69
inspection.


366
0:15:14,69 --> 0:15:16,85
The great thing about this
facility is we have enough


367
0:15:16,85 --> 0:15:19,99
flexibility in here to always
do a fix the same day such


368
0:15:19,99 --> 0:15:21,62
that it doesn't disrupt
our output


369
0:15:21,62 --> 0:15:24,8
requirements for the process.


370
0:15:24,8 --> 0:15:26,68
So it comes all the way down
this particular facility here,


371
0:15:26,68 --> 0:15:28,65
shuffles across again, and then
goes into the polishing


372
0:15:28,65 --> 0:15:30,2
and final finishing site.


373
0:15:30,2 --> 0:15:33,5
Every single car gets a full
flat and polish so that we


374
0:15:33,5 --> 0:15:36,17
raise the optical aspect
of the vehicle.


375
0:15:36,17 --> 0:15:39,97
So we create a far greater
level of depth


376
0:15:39,97 --> 0:15:40,75
on the color itself.


377
0:15:40,75 --> 0:15:42,395
So you can actually look
into the color.


378
0:15:42,395 --> 0:15:43,86
And you're not just looking
at surface.


379
0:15:43,86 --> 0:15:46,226
You're actually looking
into the color.


380
0:15:46,226 --> 0:16:5,946



381
0:16:5,946 --> 0:16:8,3
FRANK STEPHENSON: Everything you
see on the car, we like to


382
0:16:8,3 --> 0:16:9,34
say it is done for a reason.


383
0:16:9,34 --> 0:16:11,96
Which means that everything that
you see has an effect on


384
0:16:11,96 --> 0:16:13,71
the overall performance
of the car.


385
0:16:13,71 --> 0:16:18,18
And more so also, when they do
say form follows function,


386
0:16:18,18 --> 0:16:20,29
that sounds nice
and everything.


387
0:16:20,29 --> 0:16:21,7
But with this car, pretty much,


388
0:16:21,7 --> 0:16:23,0
it's form equals function.


389
0:16:23,0 --> 0:16:24,48
What looks right works.


390
0:16:24,48 --> 0:16:27,68
What we've done is, of course,
you have the two main intakes


391
0:16:27,68 --> 0:16:29,62
on the front which are for
your inner coolers.


392
0:16:29,62 --> 0:16:32,1
They specifically have to get
a lot of very air in there


393
0:16:32,1 --> 0:16:35,81
very efficiently and do
the job of cooling.


394
0:16:35,81 --> 0:16:37,66
But also, we have what
we call a splitter


395
0:16:37,66 --> 0:16:38,35
right here in the front.


396
0:16:38,35 --> 0:16:42,7
And that creates a lot of
downforce, creates the right


397
0:16:42,7 --> 0:16:45,43
feel for the road
with the car.


398
0:16:45,43 --> 0:16:47,38
This area is very critical
underneath.


399
0:16:47,38 --> 0:16:50,4
If you rub your hand underneath,
you'll feel some,


400
0:16:50,4 --> 0:16:50,69
what we call diblets.


401
0:16:50,69 --> 0:16:51,8
They're little--


402
0:16:51,8 --> 0:16:52,9
JF MUSIAL: Oh, yeah.


403
0:16:52,9 --> 0:16:53,59
FRANK STEPHENSON: --pumps that
actually straighten out the


404
0:16:53,59 --> 0:16:56,24
airflow underneath, things that
you don't even see, but


405
0:16:56,24 --> 0:16:57,1
they're on the car.


406
0:16:57,1 --> 0:17:0,66
I mean, every detail is really
taken to the max on this car.


407
0:17:0,66 --> 0:17:2,8
This is what we called
biomimicry.


408
0:17:2,8 --> 0:17:4,63
There's a lot of influence
from what really works.


409
0:17:4,63 --> 0:17:8,39
Some organisms in the world
use this type of design


410
0:17:8,39 --> 0:17:11,0
feature for purpose basically.


411
0:17:11,0 --> 0:17:13,579
We have had a little bit of
freedom with the headlights.


412
0:17:13,579 --> 0:17:15,881
This is where you can really
start to give the car a little


413
0:17:15,881 --> 0:17:17,49
bit of a unique look.


414
0:17:17,49 --> 0:17:20,69
It's almost as if it's the
eyes of the person.


415
0:17:20,69 --> 0:17:22,77
Eyes do give people a
lot of character.


416
0:17:22,77 --> 0:17:26,69
So we're not really influencing
too much


417
0:17:26,69 --> 0:17:27,5
technology here.


418
0:17:27,5 --> 0:17:29,48
We are using high-tech
Xenon lamps.


419
0:17:29,48 --> 0:17:32,64
But you can see that the actual
form of your daytime


420
0:17:32,64 --> 0:17:35,57
running lamps sort of creates
the feel of the McLaren logo.


421
0:17:35,57 --> 0:17:36,21
JF MUSIAL: Uh-huh.


422
0:17:36,21 --> 0:17:38,2
FRANK STEPHENSON: We let the
light bleed through these


423
0:17:38,2 --> 0:17:40,47
three little slots here
which are almost


424
0:17:40,47 --> 0:17:41,82
like fins or gills--


425
0:17:41,82 --> 0:17:42,656
JF MUSIAL: Gills-- that's
exactly what I was going to--


426
0:17:42,656 --> 0:17:43,74
FRANK STEPHENSON:
--of a shark.


427
0:17:43,74 --> 0:17:44,33
JF MUSIAL: --going to
describe as gills.


428
0:17:44,33 --> 0:17:45,58
FRANK STEPHENSON: And that sort
of-- when you're in the


429
0:17:45,58 --> 0:17:47,61
front, you look back and you see
that, it really gives the


430
0:17:47,61 --> 0:17:49,98
car its own unique look to it.


431
0:17:49,98 --> 0:17:51,86
Another thing that we've really
concentrated on is


432
0:17:51,86 --> 0:17:55,305
keeping the cowl, the back of
the hood, as low as we can for


433
0:17:55,305 --> 0:17:58,15
full optimal forward
visibility.


434
0:17:58,15 --> 0:17:59,95
So we pushed it quite
far down.


435
0:17:59,95 --> 0:18:2,875
That gives us a great
viewing angle from


436
0:18:2,875 --> 0:18:4,66
the driver's position.


437
0:18:4,66 --> 0:18:7,61
And one of the funny things
that you would not really


438
0:18:7,61 --> 0:18:9,633
notice unless you're actually
sitting in the car-- it's very


439
0:18:9,633 --> 0:18:12,4
interesting-- is that the center
point of the wheel is


440
0:18:12,4 --> 0:18:16,98
directly under the highest
point of the fender.


441
0:18:16,98 --> 0:18:19,315
Which means when you're actually
sitting down, you


442
0:18:19,315 --> 0:18:21,62
know where your wheels are
placed to hit the apex.


443
0:18:21,62 --> 0:18:22,55
JF MUSIAL: Because you see it.


444
0:18:22,55 --> 0:18:23,8
FRANK STEPHENSON: Because you
know that the farthest point


445
0:18:23,8 --> 0:18:26,2
you're looking-- or the highest
point-- is actually


446
0:18:26,2 --> 0:18:26,76
the center of the wheel.


447
0:18:26,76 --> 0:18:28,205
So you can really place it--


448
0:18:28,205 --> 0:18:28,68
JF MUSIAL: Interesting.


449
0:18:28,68 --> 0:18:30,52
FRANK STEPHENSON: --precisely
that way.


450
0:18:30,52 --> 0:18:32,865
Really important is actually
this blade that we have here


451
0:18:32,865 --> 0:18:33,38
on the side.


452
0:18:33,38 --> 0:18:35,7
And although it looks kind of
like an element that we sat


453
0:18:35,7 --> 0:18:39,21
down and designed and had fun
with, it really came out of


454
0:18:39,21 --> 0:18:42,59
the computer, out of
what we call CFD,


455
0:18:42,59 --> 0:18:44,43
Computational Fluid Dynamics.


456
0:18:44,43 --> 0:18:48,0
And in our intent to make the
car as small as possible and


457
0:18:48,0 --> 0:18:50,43
center all the weight towards
the center of the car, we've


458
0:18:50,43 --> 0:18:54,3
actually turned the radiators
parallel to the direction of


459
0:18:54,3 --> 0:18:57,96
the car to get the weight, the
mass, all towards the middle.


460
0:18:57,96 --> 0:19:1,4
This blade here has been done
on the computer such that it


461
0:19:1,4 --> 0:19:4,19
generates or actually keeps
the air attached to it.


462
0:19:4,19 --> 0:19:6,78
And it throws it in on
an accelerated curve.


463
0:19:6,78 --> 0:19:10,115
So you get plenty of
coin that way.


464
0:19:10,115 --> 0:19:11,407
So this blade is
[INTERPOSING VOICES]


465
0:19:11,407 --> 0:19:13,16
very necessary.


466
0:19:13,16 --> 0:19:14,51
Of course, it adds flavor
to the car and


467
0:19:14,51 --> 0:19:15,62
makes it more unique.


468
0:19:15,62 --> 0:19:18,15
But it's there for a
reason, as I said.


469
0:19:18,15 --> 0:19:20,7
Another element that I really
like on the car is what we


470
0:19:20,7 --> 0:19:22,91
call the air brake on
the back of the car.


471
0:19:22,91 --> 0:19:26,29
And we don't consider
it a spoiler.


472
0:19:26,29 --> 0:19:28,18
It's not even used
as a spoiler.


473
0:19:28,18 --> 0:19:31,84
It's basically a way
of adjusting the


474
0:19:31,84 --> 0:19:32,64
braking on the car.


475
0:19:32,64 --> 0:19:34,822
So anytime you break
in anger--


476
0:19:34,822 --> 0:19:35,65
JF MUSIAL: In anger--


477
0:19:35,65 --> 0:19:35,89
I like that.


478
0:19:35,89 --> 0:19:35,97
[LAUGHTER]


479
0:19:35,97 --> 0:19:39,8
FRANK STEPHENSON: Well, with
intent to break, I guess, to


480
0:19:39,8 --> 0:19:40,42
slow down--


481
0:19:40,42 --> 0:19:41,66
it goes 90 degrees.


482
0:19:41,66 --> 0:19:46,66
And what happens then is that
the center of gravity actually


483
0:19:46,66 --> 0:19:50,1
moves back towards the back of
the car and puts more weight


484
0:19:50,1 --> 0:19:52,412
on the back wheels so that you
can actually use the breaks in


485
0:19:52,412 --> 0:19:53,515
the rear a little bit more.


486
0:19:53,515 --> 0:19:55,46
A lot of the action is actually
done by the wind


487
0:19:55,46 --> 0:19:58,29
itself, not by pushing it
up but releasing it.


488
0:19:58,29 --> 0:20:1,19
And then lift-- go
up on its own.


489
0:20:1,19 --> 0:20:5,52
One of the design words that we
use a lot on the car is to


490
0:20:5,52 --> 0:20:6,82
actually-- for the language--


491
0:20:6,82 --> 0:20:9,64
is actually to almost, like,
shrink-wrap the surface.


492
0:20:9,64 --> 0:20:14,85
Whereas a lot of cars add
volume, what we're trying here


493
0:20:14,85 --> 0:20:16,33
to do is take away volume.


494
0:20:16,33 --> 0:20:18,36
So you're almost, like,
shrink-wrapping the metal over


495
0:20:18,36 --> 0:20:21,12
the hard points, which are
suspension mounts, or vision


496
0:20:21,12 --> 0:20:24,59
angles, or head clearance
angles, whatever.


497
0:20:24,59 --> 0:20:26,95
So we're trying to minimize,
take weight out of the car, by


498
0:20:26,95 --> 0:20:29,534
reducing the amount of surface
area we have running.


499
0:20:29,534 --> 0:20:30,32
JF MUSIAL: Got it.


500
0:20:30,32 --> 0:20:32,38
LEE BOYCE: So this is basically
the start of the


501
0:20:32,38 --> 0:20:34,19
trim and final part
of the process.


502
0:20:34,19 --> 0:20:36,15
This is where we start
layering the car and


503
0:20:36,15 --> 0:20:38,86
installing it ready for us to
take it to a point of--


504
0:20:38,86 --> 0:20:39,78
JF MUSIAL: No wiring harness?


505
0:20:39,78 --> 0:20:40,19
Wiring harness?


506
0:20:40,19 --> 0:20:40,51
LEE BOYCE: Wiring harness--it's


507
0:20:40,51 --> 0:20:41,62
as simple as that.


508
0:20:41,62 --> 0:20:42,18
JF MUSIAL: Yeah.


509
0:20:42,18 --> 0:20:44,4
LEE BOYCE: So we have the
opportunity of being able to


510
0:20:44,4 --> 0:20:48,4
produce the same amount of cars
in this facility as any


511
0:20:48,4 --> 0:20:52,135
of our competitors with their
levels of industrialization.


512
0:20:52,135 --> 0:20:53,76
You don't actually need that.


513
0:20:53,76 --> 0:20:57,7
And we wanted to create a
different blueprint for how to


514
0:20:57,7 --> 0:20:58,39
build cars.


515
0:20:58,39 --> 0:21:2,2
And if we take a look at these
vehicle ramps here, these are


516
0:21:2,2 --> 0:21:3,56
a standard vehicle ramp.


517
0:21:3,56 --> 0:21:5,43
But we wanted to make sure
that we put some nice


518
0:21:5,43 --> 0:21:6,74
architectural cladding
around it.


519
0:21:6,74 --> 0:21:9,56
And we made sure that we set all
of the services underneath


520
0:21:9,56 --> 0:21:10,35
the tiles as well.


521
0:21:10,35 --> 0:21:13,9
So you do not see any lines.


522
0:21:13,9 --> 0:21:15,135
And that's why everything
is really clean.


523
0:21:15,135 --> 0:21:18,35
And it was really important to
us that we didn't trailing air


524
0:21:18,35 --> 0:21:20,48
lines, and we didn't see
trailing cables.


525
0:21:20,48 --> 0:21:24,3
This is a really interesting
feature in the facility.


526
0:21:24,3 --> 0:21:26,58
Again, same diameter, same
radius, but what's really


527
0:21:26,58 --> 0:21:28,71
interesting here is that all
of the services are in a


528
0:21:28,71 --> 0:21:30,15
trench here.


529
0:21:30,15 --> 0:21:30,47
JF MUSIAL: Got it.


530
0:21:30,47 --> 0:21:32,32
LEE BOYCE: So we have this
trench that runs the full


531
0:21:32,32 --> 0:21:32,66
length of the building.


532
0:21:32,66 --> 0:21:36,39
We have those in three or four
places across the building.


533
0:21:36,39 --> 0:21:39,28
All of the services actually go
feed up through the back of


534
0:21:39,28 --> 0:21:42,53
these tool cabinets there,
so that all of the IT


535
0:21:42,53 --> 0:21:45,96
functionality is fed up
through here as well.


536
0:21:45,96 --> 0:21:47,4
So you don't see any
cables here.


537
0:21:47,4 --> 0:21:48,82
And if you need to use
compressed air or you need to


538
0:21:48,82 --> 0:21:50,83
use single phase electrics,
it's all


539
0:21:50,83 --> 0:21:52,4
embedded within the facility.


540
0:21:52,4 --> 0:21:55,56
And you just don't
see any cabling.


541
0:21:55,56 --> 0:21:59,89
Every single operator is
accountable for his work.


542
0:21:59,89 --> 0:22:1,2
They work with what we call--


543
0:22:1,2 --> 0:22:3,12
we have this little access
swipe system.


544
0:22:3,12 --> 0:22:5,72
So when the car comes into the
facility, every single


545
0:22:5,72 --> 0:22:8,73
operator has to swipe
his card.


546
0:22:8,73 --> 0:22:10,3
If we take a look here--


547
0:22:10,3 --> 0:22:12,27
I won't do it because it means
I'll have to start assembling


548
0:22:12,27 --> 0:22:12,96
parts of the car.


549
0:22:12,96 --> 0:22:15,63
But he would swipe his card
across the reader there.


550
0:22:15,63 --> 0:22:17,38
And then that locks him
personally into that


551
0:22:17,38 --> 0:22:19,72
particular vehicle to undertake
a certain amount of


552
0:22:19,72 --> 0:22:20,5
work on that particular car.


553
0:22:20,5 --> 0:22:20,885
JF MUSIAL: He's responsible.


554
0:22:20,885 --> 0:22:23,15
LEE BOYCE: He's absolutely
100% responsible.


555
0:22:23,15 --> 0:22:25,221
Now, we're getting into
the final stages of--


556
0:22:25,221 --> 0:22:26,768
JF MUSIAL: I'm seeing a bunch
of grease pen on here.


557
0:22:26,768 --> 0:22:29,78
So 248, 248-- so that's how
you identify [INAUDIBLE]


558
0:22:29,78 --> 0:22:30,615
LEE BOYCE: That's how
we identify--


559
0:22:30,615 --> 0:22:31,14
JF MUSIAL: [INAUDIBLE]


560
0:22:31,14 --> 0:22:31,67
LEE BOYCE: Absolutely.


561
0:22:31,67 --> 0:22:33,5
So this particular panel
was painted with


562
0:22:33,5 --> 0:22:33,84
this particular body.


563
0:22:33,84 --> 0:22:36,74
So that we absolutely make
sure we don't get any


564
0:22:36,74 --> 0:22:38,43
inconsistencies with
color matching or


565
0:22:38,43 --> 0:22:38,88
anything like this.


566
0:22:38,88 --> 0:22:40,3
JF MUSIAL: Got it.


567
0:22:40,3 --> 0:22:41,51
LEE BOYCE: And not only that--


568
0:22:41,51 --> 0:22:44,88
we want to make sure that this
particular component is going


569
0:22:44,88 --> 0:22:47,5
to be reset with this particular
door, so we get a


570
0:22:47,5 --> 0:22:49,44
really good fit and finish from
a gap and profile point


571
0:22:49,44 --> 0:22:50,5
of view as well.


572
0:22:50,5 --> 0:22:51,5
LEE BOYCE: JF MUSIAL: Got it.


573
0:22:51,5 --> 0:22:52,73
So what we're doing here now on
this particular station--


574
0:22:52,73 --> 0:22:54,73
this is the geometry
setup lift.


575
0:22:54,73 --> 0:22:58,3
This is basically where we do
toe, camber, ride heights, and


576
0:22:58,3 --> 0:23:0,37
all of that sort of thing in
readiness for when we go into


577
0:23:0,37 --> 0:23:3,555
the dynamic rig.


578
0:23:3,555 --> 0:23:4,52
JF MUSIAL: Cool.


579
0:23:4,52 --> 0:23:4,55
LEE BOYCE: [INAUDIBLE]


580
0:23:4,55 --> 0:23:6,65
This is where we put the
car through its first


581
0:23:6,65 --> 0:23:7,59
real dynamic load.


582
0:23:7,59 --> 0:23:9,73
So we do an engine
fire-up further


583
0:23:9,73 --> 0:23:10,95
upstream in the process.


584
0:23:10,95 --> 0:23:12,27
And this is where we put
the car through some


585
0:23:12,27 --> 0:23:13,3
dynamic load here now.


586
0:23:13,3 --> 0:23:15,96
So basically, we bring the car
up to temperature, check most


587
0:23:15,96 --> 0:23:19,88
of the electrical systems are
working, and all of the brains


588
0:23:19,88 --> 0:23:23,11
in the vehicle are communicating
with each other.


589
0:23:23,11 --> 0:23:25,925
We do some brake activity.


590
0:23:25,925 --> 0:23:28,15
We do some acceleration,
deceleration.


591
0:23:28,15 --> 0:23:30,4
But just generally, put the
car through some immediate


592
0:23:30,4 --> 0:23:31,21
dynamic loads.


593
0:23:31,21 --> 0:23:31,7
JF MUSIAL: Yeah.


594
0:23:31,7 --> 0:23:33,64
LEE BOYCE: So in essence,
vehicle goes through a dynamic


595
0:23:33,64 --> 0:23:35,95
rig into the Monsoon where
we give it a full


596
0:23:35,95 --> 0:23:36,685
saturation of water.


597
0:23:36,685 --> 0:23:36,91
I don't know--


598
0:23:36,91 --> 0:23:39,55
16,000 liters in about 6
or 7 minutes-- it's a


599
0:23:39,55 --> 0:23:41,91
huge amount of water.


600
0:23:41,91 --> 0:23:42,92
Car exits there.


601
0:23:42,92 --> 0:23:46,15
It then gets prepared, ready for
external drive appraisal.


602
0:23:46,15 --> 0:23:47,59
They all leave through
that door there.


603
0:23:47,59 --> 0:23:48,3
JF MUSIAL: OK.


604
0:23:48,3 --> 0:23:49,785
LEE BOYCE: Goes out on its
external drive appraisal where


605
0:23:49,785 --> 0:23:52,5
we put it through some more
aggressive loads.


606
0:23:52,5 --> 0:23:54,28
One of things-- when we were
landscaping the whole


607
0:23:54,28 --> 0:23:57,59
exterior, the outside of the
facility, what was really


608
0:23:57,59 --> 0:24:0,46
important to us was to try
and optimize the land


609
0:24:0,46 --> 0:24:1,1
around us as well.


610
0:24:1,1 --> 0:24:5,16
So we've got cobbled sections
of roadway out there which


611
0:24:5,16 --> 0:24:7,315
allow us to shake and rattle the
car a little bit just to


612
0:24:7,315 --> 0:24:7,8
loosen anything.


613
0:24:7,8 --> 0:24:10,8
Go before we actually take it
on the highways and byways.


614
0:24:10,8 --> 0:24:10,51
JF MUSIAL: Ah.


615
0:24:10,51 --> 0:24:13,11
LEE BOYCE: Obviously, during
the wetter seasons in the


616
0:24:13,11 --> 0:24:15,7
year, the car could come back
with some muck and what have


617
0:24:15,7 --> 0:24:15,92
you on them.


618
0:24:15,92 --> 0:24:18,1
And that's why we just have this
wash down rig here now.


619
0:24:18,1 --> 0:24:20,31
So we just give the underside
a quick wash down and just


620
0:24:20,31 --> 0:24:23,4
make sure that the vehicle
is fully cleaned


621
0:24:23,4 --> 0:24:24,47
before it exits here.


622
0:24:24,47 --> 0:24:27,59
It would sit normally on here
for 45 minutes, just to have a


623
0:24:27,59 --> 0:24:28,68
final drip-dry.


624
0:24:28,68 --> 0:24:30,68
We take a look at the vehicle
after its been out on an


625
0:24:30,68 --> 0:24:32,33
external drive.


626
0:24:32,33 --> 0:24:34,9
And what we do is we're
basically checking to make


627
0:24:34,9 --> 0:24:37,77
sure that nothing has worked
loose, there are no weeps, or


628
0:24:37,77 --> 0:24:39,36
leaks, or anything like that
from any of the joints.


629
0:24:39,36 --> 0:24:41,61
JF MUSIAL: Yeah.


630
0:24:41,61 --> 0:24:43,27
LEE BOYCE: There's been no
displacement of any harness


631
0:24:43,27 --> 0:24:44,52
clips or anything like this.


632
0:24:44,52 --> 0:24:46,66
And everything [INAUDIBLE] is
absolutely how we want it to


633
0:24:46,66 --> 0:24:49,17
be-- a very, very critical
station.


634
0:24:49,17 --> 0:24:52,94
We're getting ourselves ready
to hand the car over to the


635
0:24:52,94 --> 0:24:57,42
auditors with what we perceive
to be a car that is acceptable


636
0:24:57,42 --> 0:24:59,246
for the customer.


637
0:24:59,246 --> 0:25:3,55
The auditors then give it a
really thorough investigation,


638
0:25:3,55 --> 0:25:4,51
an interrogation.


639
0:25:4,51 --> 0:25:9,92
And again, they go to the nth
degree of checking service


640
0:25:9,92 --> 0:25:13,5
quality, checking fit and
finish, checking functionality


641
0:25:13,5 --> 0:25:14,63
of all of the systems.


642
0:25:14,63 --> 0:25:17,14
JF MUSIAL: So that's it.


643
0:25:17,14 --> 0:25:19,45
These cars go to the
customers, right?


644
0:25:19,45 --> 0:25:21,65
LEE BOYCE: These cars are ready
to go to the customer.


645
0:25:21,65 --> 0:25:22,21
JF MUSIAL: So where's--


646
0:25:22,21 --> 0:25:22,75
LEE BOYCE: [INAUDIBLE]


647
0:25:22,75 --> 0:25:23,73
JF MUSIAL: Where's the
car I'm driving?


648
0:25:23,73 --> 0:25:24,99
LEE BOYCE: Unfortunately,
it's not one of these.


649
0:25:24,99 --> 0:25:28,18
But just for you, we have
one back at the base.


650
0:25:28,18 --> 0:25:28,78
JF MUSIAL: Cool.


651
0:25:28,78 --> 0:25:29,8
LEE BOYCE: OK.


652
0:25:29,8 --> 0:25:30,33
JF MUSIAL: Thank you.


653
0:25:30,33 --> 0:27:30,33
