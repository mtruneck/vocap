###0 In the last video we learned a little bit about
###2 photosynthesis.
###4 And we know in very general terms, it's the process where
###6 we start off with photons and water and carbon dioxide, and
###12 we use that energy in the photons to fix the carbon.
###16 And now, this idea of carbon fixation is essentially taking
###20 carbon in the gaseous form, in this case carbon dioxide, and
###24 fixing it into a solid structure.
###26 And that solid structure we fix it into is a carbohydrate.
###30 The first end-product of photosynthesis was this
###33 3-carbon chain, this glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.
###36 But then you can use that to build up glucose or any other
###40 carbohydrate.
###42 So, with that said, let's try to dig a little bit deeper and
###45 understand what's actually going on in these stages of
###48 photosynthesis.
###49 Remember, we said there's two stages.
###50 The light-dependent reactions and then you have the light
###54 independent reactions.
###55 I don't like using the word dark reaction because it
###57 actually occurs while the sun is outside.
###59 It's actually occurring simultaneously
###61 with the light reactions.
###62 It just doesn't need the photons from the sun.
###65 But let's focus first on the light-dependent reactions.
###68 The part that actually uses photons from the sun.
###72 Or actually, I guess, even photons from the heat lamp
###76 that you might have in your greenhouse.
###79 And uses those photons in conjunction with water to
###83 produce ATP and reduce NADP plus to NADPH.
###95 Remember, reduction is gaining electrons or hydrogen atoms.
###100 And it's the same thing, because when you gain a
###102 hydrogen atom, including its electron, since hydrogen is
###105 not too electronegative, you get to hog its electron.
###108 So this is both gaining a hydrogen and gaining electron.
###111 But let's study it a little bit more.
###113 So before we dig a little deeper, I think it's good to
###116 know a little bit about the anatomy of a plant.
###119 So let me draw some plant cells.
###123 So plant cells actually have cell walls, so I can draw them
###126 a little bit rigid.
###128 So let's say that these are plant cells right here.
###131 Each of these squares, each of these quadrilaterals is a
###135 plant cell.
###137 And then in these plant cells you have these organelles
###139 called chloroplasts.
###140 Remember organelles are like organs of a cell.
###142 They are subunits,
###144 membrane-bound subunits of cells.
###147 And of course, these cells have nucleuses and DNA and all
###150 of the other things you normally associate with cells.
###152 But I'm not going to draw them here.
###153 I'm just going to draw the chloroplasts.
###155 And your average plant cell-- and there are other types of
###160 living organisms that perform photosynthesis, but we'll
###163 focus on plants.
###164 Because that's what we tend to associate it with.
###167 Each plant cell will contain 10 to 50 chloroplasts.
###173 I make them green on purpose because the chloroplasts
###176 contain chlorophyll.
###177 Which to our eyes, appear green.
###179 But remember, they're green because they reflect green
###181 light and they absorb red and blue and other
###185 wavelengths of light.
###186 That's why it looks green.
###186 Because it's reflecting.
###187 But it's absorbing all the other wavelengths.
###189 But anyway, we'll talk more about that in detail.
###191 But you'll have 10 to 50 of these chloroplasts right here.
###196 And then let's zoom in on one chloroplast. So if we zoom in
###199 on one chloroplast. So let me be very clear.
###203 This thing right here is a plant cell.
###206 That is a plant cell.
###209 And then each of these green things right here is an
###212 organelle called the chloroplast. And let's zoom in
###218 on the chloroplast itself.
###221 If we zoom in on one chloroplast, it has a
###226 membrane like that.
###228 
###232 And then the fluid inside of the chloroplast, inside of its
###237 membrane, so this fluid right here.
###239 All of this fluid.
###240 That's called the stroma.
###242 The stroma of the chloroplast. And then within the
###246 chloroplast itself, you have these little stacks of these
###249 folded membranes, These little folded stacks.
###253 Let me see if I can do justice here.
###256 So maybe that's one, two, doing these stacks.
###262 Each of these membrane-bound-- you can almost view them as
###265 pancakes-- let me draw a couple more.
###268 Maybe we have some over here, just so you-- maybe you have
###271 some over here, maybe some over here.
###275 So each of these flattish looking pancakes right here,
###278 these are called thylakoids.
###280 So this right here is a thylakoid.
###283 That is a thylakoid.
###284 
###288 The thylakoid has a membrane.
###290 And this membrane is especially important.
###291 We're going to zoom in on that in a second.
###293 So it has a membrane, I'll color that in a little bit.
###297 The inside of the thylakoid, so the space, the fluid inside
###301 of the thylakoid, right there that area.
###304 This light green color right there.
###306 That's called the thylakoid space or the thylakoid lumen.
###310 
###312 And just to get all of our terminology out of the way, a
###316 stack of several thylakoids just like that,
###322 that is called a grana.
###324 That's a stack of thylakoids.
###327 That is a grana.
###329 And this is an organelle.
###331 And evolutionary biologists, they believe that organelles
###335 were once independent organisms that then,
###338 essentially, teamed up with other organisms and started
###341 living inside of their cells.
###342 So there's actually, they have their own DNA.
###345 So mitochondria is another example of an organelle that
###348 people believe that one time mitochondria, or the ancestors
###351 of mitochondria, were independent organisms. That
###353 then teamed up with other cells and said, hey, if I
###356 produce your energy maybe you'll give me
###358 some food or whatnot.
###360 And so they started evolving together.
###362 And they turned into one organism.
###363 Which makes you wonder what we might evolve-- well anyway,
###366 that's a separate thing.
###367 So there's actually ribosomes out here.
###369 That's good to think about.
###370 Just realize that at one point in the evolutionary past, this
###376 organelle's ancestor might have been
###378 an independent organism.
###380 But anyway, enough about that speculation.
###382 Let's zoom in again on one of these thylakoid membranes.
###389 So I'm going to zoom in.
###391 Let me make a box.
###392 
###394 Let me zoom in right there.
###397 So that's going to be my zoom-in box.
###398 So let me make it really big.
###401 Just like this.
###402 So this is my zoom-in box.
###405 So that little box is the same thing as this whole box.
###409 So we're zoomed in on the thylakoid membrane.
###413 So this is the thylakoid membrane right there.
###417 That's actually a phospho-bilipd layer.
###419 It has your hydrophilic, hydrophobic tails.
###424 I mean, I could draw it like that if you like.
###425 The important thing from the photosynthesis point of view
###427 is that it's this membrane.
###429 And on the outside of the membrane, right here on the
###433 outside, you have the fluid that fills up the entire
###436 chloroplast. So here you have the stroma.
###440 And then this space right here, this is the inside of
###443 your thylakoid.
###444 So this is the lumen.
###445 So if I were to color it pink, right there.
###447 This is your lumen.
###449 Your thylakoid space.
###450 And in this membrane, and this might look a little bit
###453 familiar if you think about mitochondria and the electron
###456 transport chain.
###457 What I'm going to describe in this video actually is an
###459 electron transport chain.
###461 Many people might not consider it the electron transport
###464 chain, but it's the same idea.
###466 Same general idea.
###468 So on this membrane you have these proteins and these
###471 complexes of proteins and molecules
###473 that span this membrane.
###475 So let me draw a couple of them.
###478 So maybe I'll call this one, photosystem II.
###481 And I'm calling it that because that's what it is.
###484 Photosystem II.
###485 You have maybe another complex.
###487 And these are hugely complicated.
###488 I'll do a sneak peek of what photosystem II
###491 actually looks like.
###492 This is actually what photosystem II looks like.
###495 So, as you can see, it truly is a complex.
###497 These cylindrical things, these are proteins.
###500 These green things are chlorophyll molecules.
###503 I mean, there's all sorts of things going here.
###505 And they're all jumbled together.
###507 I think a complex probably is the best word.
###509 It's a bunch of proteins, a bunch of molecules just
###512 jumbled together to perform a very particular function.
###515 We're going to describe that in a few seconds.
###518 So that's what photosystem II looks like.
###520 Then you also have photosystem I.
###523 And then you have other molecules, other complexes.
###527 You have the cytochrome B6F complex and I'll draw this in
###532 a different color right here.
###535 I don't want to get too much into the weeds.
###537 Because the most important thing is just to understand.
###539 So you have other protein complexes, protein molecular
###542 complexes here that also span the membrane.
###546 But the general idea-- I'll tell you the general idea and
###548 then we'll go into the specifics-- of what happens
###551 during the light reaction, or the light dependent reaction,
###563 is you have some photons.
###565 Photons from the sun.
###567 They've traveled 93 million miles.
###569 so you have some photons that go here and they excite
###574 electrons in a chlorophyll molecule, in a
###577 chlorophyll A molecule.
###579 And actually in photosystem II-- well, I won't go into the
###582 details just yet-- but they excite a chlorophyll molecule
###585 so those electrons enter into a high energy state.
###589 Maybe I shouldn't draw it like that.
###590 They enter into a high energy state.
###591 And then as they go from molecule to molecule they keep
###596 going down in energy state.
###597 But as they go down in energy state, you have hydrogen
###601 atoms, or actually I should say hydrogen protons without
###604 the electrons.
###605 So you have all of these hydrogen protons.
###608 Hydrogen protons get pumped into the lumen.
###612 They get pumped into the lumen and so you might remember this
###615 from the electron transport chain.
###617 In the electron transport chain, as electrons went from
###619 a high potential, a high energy state, to a low energy
###624 state, that energy was used to pump
###627 hydrogens through a membrane.
###629 And in that case it was in the mitochondria, here the
###633 membrane is the thylakoid membrane.
###635 But either case, you're creating this gradient where--
###639 because of the energy from, essentially the photons-- the
###643 electrons enter a high energy state, they keep going into a
###646 lower energy state.
###647 And then they actually go to photosystem I and they get hit
###649 by another photon.
###650 Well, that's a simplification, but that's how you
###652 can think of it.
###653 Enter another high energy state, then they go to a
###655 lower, lower and lower energy state.
###656 But the whole time, that energy from the electrons
###659 going from a high energy state to a low energy state is used
###662 to pump hydrogen protons into the lumen.
###667 So you have this huge
###668 concentration of hydrogen protons.
###671 And just like what we saw in the electron transport chain,
###677 that concentration is then-- of hydrogen protons-- is then
###681 used to drive ATP synthase.
###684 So the exact same-- let me see if I can draw that ATP
###688 synthase here.
###689 You might remember ATP synthase looks
###690 something like this.
###693 Where literally, so here you have a huge concentration of
###696 hydrogen protons.
###697 So they'll want to go back into the
###701 stroma from the lumen.
###702 And they do.
###702 And they go through the ATP synthase.
###705 Let me do it in a new color.
###707 So these hydrogen protons are going to make their way back.
###711 Go back down the gradient.
###713 And as they go down the gradient, they literally--
###715 it's like an engine.
###716 And I go into detail on this when I talk about respiration.
###719 And that turns, literally mechanically turns, this top
###724 part-- the way I drew it-- of the ATP synthase.
###726 And it puts ADP and phosphate groups together.
###731 It puts ADP plus phosphate groups
###735 together to produce ATP.
###740 So that's the general, very high overview.
###742 And I'm going to go into more detail in a second.
###745 But this process that I just described is called
###749 photophosphorylation.
###752 Let me do it in a nice color.
###753 
###760 Why is it called that?
###761 Well, because we're using photons.
###763 That's the photo part.
###764 We're using light.
###765 We're using photons to excite electrons in chlorophyll.
###769 As those electrons get passed from one molecule, from one
###772 electron acceptor to another, they enter into lower and
###775 lower energy states.
###777 As they go into lower energy states, that's used to drive,
###781 literally, pumps that allow hydrogen protons to go from
###785 the stroma to the lumen.
###787 Then the hydrogen protons want to go back.
###789 They want to-- I guess you could call it-- chemiosmosis.
###793 They want to go back into the stroma and then that drives
###796 ATP synthase.
###799 Right here, this is ATP synthase.
###801 ATP synthase to essentially jam together ADPs and
###806 phosphate groups to produce ATP.
###809 Now, when I originally talked about the light reactions and
###814 dark reactions I said, well the light reactions have two
###817 byproducts.
###818 It has ATP and it also has-- actually it has three.
###822 It has ATP, and it also has NADPH.
###826 NADP is reduced.
###829 It gains these electrons and these hydrogens.
###831 So where does that show up?
###833 Well, if we're talking about non-cyclic oxidative
###836 photophosphorylation, or non-cyclic light reactions,
###840 the final electron acceptor.
###841 So after that electron keeps entering lower and lower
###845 energy states, the final electron
###847 acceptor is NADP plus.
###852 So once it accepts the electrons and a hydrogen
###854 proton with it, it becomes NADPH.
###857 
###860 Now, I also said that part of this process, water-- and this
###865 is actually a very interesting thing-- water gets oxidized to
###870 molecular oxygen.
###871 So where does that happen?
###872 So when I said, up here in photosystem I, that we have a
###877 chlorophyll molecule that has an electron excited, and it
###883 goes into a higher energy state.
###884 And then that electron essentially gets passed from
###886 one guy to the next, that begs the question, what can we use
###890 to replace that electron?
###892 And it turns out that we use, we literally use, the
###896 electrons in water.
###897 So over here you literally have H2O.
###903 And H2O donates the hydrogens and the electrons with it.
###908 So you can kind of imagine it donates two hydrogen protons
###910 and two electrons to replace the electron that got excited
###914 by the photons.
###915 Because that electron got passed all the way over to
###917 photosystem I and eventually ends up in NADPH.
###921 So, you're literally stripping electrons off of water.
###926 And when you strip off the electrons and the hydrogens,
###928 you're just left with molecular oxygen.
###930 Now, the reason why I want to really focus on this is that
###933 there's something profound happening here.
###934 Or at least on a chemistry level,
###936 something profound is happening.
###937 You're oxidizing water.
###943 And in the entire biological kingdom, the only place where
###946 we know something that is strong enough of an oxidizing
###949 agent to oxidize water, to literally take away electrons
###952 from water.
###953 Which means you're really taking
###954 electrons away from oxygen.
###956 So you're oxidizing oxygen.
###958 The only place that we know that an oxidation agent is
###962 strong enough to do this is in photosystem II.
###966 So it's a very profound idea, that normally electrons are
###969 very happy in water.
###970 They're very happy circulating around oxygens.
###974 Oxygen is a very electronegative atom.
###977 That's why we even call it oxidizing, because oxygen is
###980 very good at oxidizing things.
###983 But all of a sudden we've found something that can
###985 oxidize oxygen, that can strip electrons off of oxygen and
###989 then give those electrons to the chlorophyll.
###992 The electron gets excited by photons.
###995 Then those photons enter lower and lower and
###996 lower energy states.
###997 Get excited again in photosystem I by another set
###1000 of photons and then enter lower and lower and lower
###1002 energy states.
###1003 And then finally, end up at NADPH.
###1007 And the whole time it entered lower and lower energy states,
###1010 that energy was being used to pump hydrogen across this
###1014 membrane from the stroma to lumen.
###1016 And then that gradient is used to actually produce ATP.
###1021 So in the next video I'm going to give a little bit more
###1023 context about what this means in terms of energy states of
###1027 electrons and what's at a higher or lower energy state.
###1031 But this is essentially all that's happening.
###1033 Electrons get excited.
###1034 
###1037 Those electrons eventually end up at NADPH.
###1039 And as the electron gets excited and goes into lower
###1043 and lower energy states, it pumps
###1045 hydrogen across the gradient.
###1047 And then that gradient is used to drive ATP synthase, to
###1050 generate ATP.
###1052 And then that original electron that got excited, it
###1054 had to be replaced.
###1055 And that replaced electron is actually stripped off of H2O.
###1059 So the hydrogen protons and the electrons of H2O are
###1062 stripped away and you're just left with molecular oxygen.
###1066 And just to get a nice appreciation of the complexity
###1069 of all of this-- I showed you this earlier in the video--
###1071 but this is literally a-- I mean this isn't a picture of
###1075 photosystem II.
###1076 You actually don't have cylinders like this.
###1077 But these cylinders represent proteins.
###1081 Right here, these green kind of scaffold-like molecules,
###1087 that's chlorophyll A.
###1089 And what literally happens, is you have photons hitting--
###1095 actually it doesn't always have to hit chlorophyll A.
###1097 It can also hit what's called antenna molecules.
###1100 So antenna molecules are other types of chlorophyll, and
###1102 actually other types of molecules.
###1104 And so a photon, or a set of photons, comes here and maybe
###1111 it excites some electrons, it doesn't have to be in
###1115 chlorophyll A.
###1115 It could be in some of these other types of chlorophyll.
###1118 Or in some of these other I guess you could call them,
###1121 pigment molecules that will absorb these photons.
###1124 And then their electrons get excited.
###1126 And you can almost imagine it as a vibration.
###1128 But when you're talking about things on the quantum level,
###1130 vibrations really don't make sense.
###1132 But it's a good analogy.
###1133 They kind of vibrate their way to chlorophyll A.
###1135 And this is called resonance energy.
###1138 
###1144 They vibrate their way, eventually, to chlorophyll A.
###1147 And then in chlorophyll A, you have the electron get excited.
###1151 The primary electron acceptor is actually this molecule
###1155 right here.
###1156 Pheophytin.
###1157 Some people call it pheo.
###1159 And then from there, it keeps getting passed on from one
###1162 molecule to another.
###1163 I'll talk a little bit more about that in the next video.
###1165 But this is fascinating.
###1166 Look how complicated this is.
###1168 In order to essentially excite electrons and then use those
###1172 electrons to start the process of pumping
###1176 hydrogens across a membrane.
###1177 And this is an interesting place right here.
###1179 This is the water oxidation site.
###1180 So I got very excited about the idea of oxidizing water.
###1184 And so this is actually where it occurs in the photosystem
###1188 II complex.
###1189 And you actually have this very complicated mechanism.
###1191 Because it's no joke to actually strip away electrons
###1194 and hydrogens from an actual water molecule.
###1198 I'll leave you there.
###1199 And in the next video I'll talk a little bit more about
###1201 these energy states.
###1202 And I'll fill in a little bit of the gaps about what some of
###1205 these other molecules that act as hydrogen acceptors.
###1210 Or you can also view them as electron
###1212 acceptors along the way.
###1215
