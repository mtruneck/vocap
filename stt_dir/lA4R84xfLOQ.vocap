###17 MALE SPEAKER : Whoa, [INAUDIBLE]
###20 [LAUGHTER]
###22 
###27 TONY SALES: My name's Tony Sales.
###29 I'm 37 years of age.
###32 It's been said that I'm one of Britain's biggest fraudsters.
###36 In my time as a fraudster, I accumulated between 10 to 30
###41 million pounds.
###42 I spent six years of my life on the run, of which at the
###46 end I served a prison sentence.
###48 I've now set up a company called RID Fraud Ltd., which
###53 combats the sort of frauds that I used to do to help this
###58 growing epidemic that's happening throughout the UK.
###62 I could sell rice to the Chinese.
###63 Committing fraud was as easy as that for me.
###65 
###69 The London fraud network is huge, starting with young
###73 fraudsters--
###74 MALE SPEAKER: The police couldn't give two flying pigs
###77 about fraud.
###78 I've only had one encounter, and I managed to fraud that.
###82 TONY SALES: --To major organized criminal gangs
###87 stealing multi-million pounds through
###91 elaborate frauds and scams.
###92 MALE SPEAKER: People don't want to appear silly.
###95 That's why they don't ask questions.
###97 MALE SPEAKER: All your name has to do is just pop up on
###99 one of our computers, and it's done.
###101 That's you.
###102 MALE SPEAKER: Money means nothing.
###103 Buy now, pay never.
###104 
###125 TONY SALES: I'd put this telephone number down for a
###127 number for my nan to contact from the school.
###130 So if I decided to hop the wag or play truant, she could ring
###135 this number, and I would answer the phone and say,
###138 "Hello, Halstow School, can I help you?" I was 11, 12 when I
###145 was doing that.
###146 We'd go to every single one of those flats that were up in
###148 there and get people to sign our
###150 sponsorship form for a pound.
###152 They'd phone a number, and they'd say, "Hello, is the
###154 sponsorship form real?" And again, we'd say, "Yes, the
###158 sponsorship form's real.
###159 It's from Halstow School."
###161 But when your belly's hungry, and you need to eat, and you
###164 want to buy yourself a nice pair of trainers that all the
###166 other kids have got on, they're the only
###168 things you can do.
###169 And that's how you learn the trade.
###171 
###180 YOUNG CEE: This isn't really the life.
###182 You're not making as much money as you
###184 possibly can, legally.
###187 As soon as you apply for a job, you have to wait forever.
###190 And while waiting, you're on the streets, doing nothing.
###195 If you're not doing nothing, then you're doing the daily
###198 grind, which is shotting a little weed.
###200 CALLEY: You have to commit these offenses in order to eat
###203 your food for the day.
###205 Obviously, there are risks involved in doing them things.
###208 I've been shot at, and someone tried to stab me.
###213 In my opinion, violence ain't the answer.
###216 I would prefer to do the fraud scams.
###218 
###222 ALIAS: I'm just going to try and find a nice pair of
###223 trainers for myself.
###225 Yeah, these are bad, innit?
###229 You can get card details from hotels.
###231 You can get them from secret fraternities online.
###235 Getting hold of it is easy.
###237 First got into it when I was a teenager in secondary school--
###240 16, I would say.
###242 EBay scam.
###244 And I got some wrestling figures.
###246 I mean, people would just ring me up and say, mate, can you
###249 order me some Indian, please, or a pizza?
###251 I'm fucking starving.
###253 I've done stuff for people, and they haven't looked after
###256 me in return.
###257 With that being done, I know everything about them.
###260 I'll just go and take a credit card out in their name.
###262 I've even done it to a girl.
###263 She deleted me off of Facebook and I put her arse into debt
###266 for doing that.
###267 [LAUGHS]
###269 That's what happens when you delete me off Facebook.
###271 [LAUGHS]
###275 Top websites to completely annihilate if you're low on
###279 money, need clothes, want food.
###281 At number two is Harrods.
###284 The security in Harrods is actually a pile of poo.
###286 I remember me and my Slovenian boys, we raped it every single
###291 day for a month.
###292 They just went back to Slovenia with all
###294 state of the art stuff.
###296 And out there, they were getting top
###297 dollar for it, as well.
###300 At number one is Tesco, it's my favorite.
###304 This is what we help the neighborhood out with.
###307 For the single mums that don't have as much money as they
###311 would like to, they give us a bell and we just order them
###315 shopping to their house.
###317 The security on Tesco's is rubbish.
###319 But I'm happy that it's rubbish, because it's helped a
###322 lot of people.
###323 So I bought myself shitloads of DVDs because I want to
###327 start a little pirate industry.
###330 Give the little youngers something to do.
###332 This is just pleasurable.
###333 Warhammers, I love this stuff.
###336 Limited edition Warhammers.
###339 Wicked.
###340 
###342 I mean, this is just this week alone.
###345 Welcome to the life of fraud.
###346 
###353 TONY SALES: London's full and diverse of all different types
###356 of frauds going on continuously.
###358 I think the most bizarre one I ever heard of and know about
###362 is the Nigerian 419 scam of what they call black money.
###366 The black money scam just basically cons people into
###369 believing that there's a pot of gold at
###372 the end of the rainbow.
###373 
###387 MR. GOLD: My name is Mr. Gold, and I'm here to talk to you
###391 about what we call Wash Wash.
###394 And basically, what I want to show you now is how we can
###397 turn $300 into maybe $300,000.
###403 Sometimes we've targeted underworld people because,
###407 number one, they're the only people who will have a
###410 substantial amount of money sitting down at home,
###412 unaccounted for.
###414 Yes, we have taken money from the IRA.
###417 We're not intimidated by them at all.
###421 Maybe I'll say I'm the assistant to bin Laden.
###424 I have exclusive access to his hoard of money.
###429 The job now is to move the money from where it is to the
###432 West, where it can be dealt with properly.
###436 But then when I tell them that, unfortunately, the money
###439 has come defaced.
###441 But it's not an issue, because this is how security services
###445 normally move the money.
###446 And there are chemicals available in
###449 order to wash the money.
###452 The idea now is for him to buy enough chemical so that we can
###456 do his wash by the end of the week.
###460 We can never tell him what the secret chemical is.
###463 It's not really expensive, but we will tell him it's very,
###467 very expensive.
###468 It's only available to governments, and whatnot.
###471 Magic.
###473 So you give them this.
###474 So, there you go, Mr. Client.
###477 Go down the road, go buy yourself McDonald's.
###481 By the time they come back, the chest will be gone,
###484 everything will be gone, everything will be clean.
###486 
###493 Do people actually believe it?
###494 Yes they do.
###495 They believe it.
###496 To be honest with you, I could not be in the room because I
###499 would laugh.
###500 I've got a nice house, yeah, and the cars, the women, the
###504 whole shebang.
###505 And it's a lifestyle that has been bought with
###507 this kind of business.
###510 Cut.
###511 
###532 TONY SALES: Key still works.
###535 Let's have a look.
###536 
###542 This is just bank statements, a couple of wage slips,
###549 couples of passports.
###552 Absolutely everything in there.
###555 Mortgage offers.
###557 A lot of this stuff would have been given to people at a
###561 proper company to disperse of it.
###565 You know?
###566 And maybe the guy who drove the van or works in the
###569 company, who don't get the wages that he should be
###571 getting for the job that he's doing, thinks, well, I can
###575 have a little tickle, here.
###576 And he sells it to the wrong person who then would try and
###579 get hold of someone like me.
###580 This is a mortgage application in here.
###583 We got a copy of someone's passport.
###585 
###587 We got a copy of someone's P60, so now we've got a
###590 national insurance number.
###592 We've got Barclay's bank statements with the account
###596 number, sort code, everything else on it.
###601 This is how easy it is, yeah?
###602 You make a utility bill.
###604 You can make a national insurance card, because you
###606 got the national insurance number.
###608 All these things are really easy to make once you've got
###611 the right equipment.
###611 So you go into the bank, with all the stuff that you've made
###615 up now, and you just draw the money out over the counter.
###618 Once you knew how to do all this stuff, we was instant
###621 millionaires.
###621 We could have whatever we wanted, whenever we wanted it.
###624 A4 pieces of paper are cash if you know how to
###627 make them into money.
###628 
###630 The final piece of the jigsaw is ID.
###634 The best possible form of ID you can get
###636 is a British passport.
###638 People die on boats and stuff for this passport.
###641 And they climb over mountains, and they go everywhere to try
###644 and get this passport right here.
###646 With this ID, people will give you anything.
###649 They don't even question it.
###650 And They just look at it.
###651 They'll give you whatever you want, there and then.
###653 Because as far as they're
###654 concerned, it's a real passport.
###656 If you make it good enough, no one's
###658 going to question nothing.
###659 So that's the most important part, is the photo ID.
###663 So that bit's done now.
###665 So now we just need to make the rest of the utility bills
###668 and the bank statement.
###669 And that's it.
###671 We're going to make a complete bill with numbers on the back.
###675 Everything it's meant to have, it's gonna have.
###677 So when people look at it, they turn it over, it's going
###679 to have all the numbers there.
###681 Everything's in place.
###682 Even the direct debit card slip is perfect to
###685 how it should be.
###686 There is no difference whatsoever.
###688 It's absolutely perfect.
###689 
###699 People would say it's hard work, but it's not.
###700 It's an easy thing to do.
###702 Whereas most people walk past the shop, and they don't see
###704 anything, we're walking past the shop and thinking, oh,
###708 let's have a little look in there and just
###709 see what we can do.
###710 SIMMER: She's green.
###711 [INAUDIBLE]
###712 TONY SALES: Look how young that girl is.
###713 What, she's 20.
###714 What's she going to know?
###715 There's so much [INAUDIBLE]
###717 coming to play.
###718 Do you do finance?
###719 My wife said you do, yeah?
###720 FEMALE SPEAKER: It takes about 15, 20 minutes
###722 to do on the system.
###724 I just need some form of identification, preferably
###727 like a debit card.
###728 TONY SALES: Yeah, now these people are not trained in any
###732 type of financial background at all.
###736 You can go to them and say, I'd like to open a store card
###738 today in your store, please.
###740 And they'll say, OK, thank you.
###742 Could you fill this form out, sir?
###744 The House of Fraser store card.
###745 Do you do a House of Fraser store card?
###747 You do, yeah?
###747 And do I have to have any ID with me?
###750 FEMALE SPEAKER: We do need a form of ID,
###751 like a credit card.
###752 TONY SALES : All right, I've got that, yeah.
###753 Yeah, that's fine.
###754 That's fine, yeah?
###755 All right.
###757 Thank you very much!
###758 SIMMER: They want you to take it more than they think you
###760 want to take it.
###761 So just let them sell it to you.
###762 TONY SALES : Hello.
###764 I was just making some inquiries, really.
###765 I see you do up to three years' interest-free credit.
###768 FEMALE SPEAKER: Yes.
###769 TONY SALES : I'm looking to get my wife a 10 year
###771 anniversary present.
###772 Yeah, that looks all right.
###774 FEMALE SPEAKER: That's a nice-looking watch, isn't it?
###776 TONY SALES : Yeah.
###777 FEMALE SPEAKER: Marital status?
###779 You're married, yeah?
###780 10 years, was it?
###781 TONY SALES : 10 years, yeah.
###782 FEMALE SPEAKER: Same as me, this year.
###783 TONY SALES : Oh yeah?
###784 Well you don't look old enough to be married 10 years.
###786 FEMALE SPEAKER: 10 years, July.
###787 TONY SALES : Wow.
###787 FEMALE SPEAKER: Do you have any proof of
###789 residence at all with you?
###793 Driving license or utility bill?
###794 TONY SALES : I've got a utility bill.
###796 Yeah.
###797 I've left one bit in the car.
###799 [LAUGHS]
###799 Here you go.
###800 Thanks.
###802 They haven't got a clue what they're looking at, what ID
###804 they're looking at, how to check to see if the
###806 ID is real or not.
###807 They don't have a clue.
###809 And that person could issue you up to 5,000 pound credit
###813 on the spot, there and then.
###814 MALE SPEAKER: Right, you have six autographs in total, sir.
###818 Signature there.
###819 Signature and dates on that one.
###821 And there's three copies of it, basically.
###823 One for me, one for [INAUDIBLE], and one for us.
###824 TONY SALES : OK, sir.
###825 I'll go and get the card.
###826 I've got to do a couple little bits just down there, yeah.
###830 MALE SPEAKER: We'll have the watch ready, we'll have all
###831 this done, all the paperwork sorted.
###832 TONY SALES : Thank you, sir.
###834 Thank you very much.
###835 
###838 See you later, bye bye.
###840 On one day, it could be that there might be 20 of us out.
###844 And that girl does 20 applications in one day.
###848 That poor girl is going to get in trouble.
###853 SIMMER: Before I met Tony, I used to do robberies.
###856 I was robbing doorstep collection people.
###859 I was getting in so much trouble.
###861 Prison, police stations, [INAUDIBLE].
###864 It just got progressively worse.
###868 It was wearing a bit thin.
###870 I could see a long prison sentence coming out of
###871 something like that.
###871 I just met Hott.
###872 And he just showed me a different way where I wasn't
###875 getting into trouble so much.
###876 He just brought me in like it was just an old
###879 family sort of thing.
###880 It was just an easy way of life.
###882 I didn't worry about nothing.
###883 I didn't have to worry about money.
###884 Nice clothes, whatever I wanted.
###887 Growing up, I never used to have nothing like that.
###889 When I stopped robbing and started doing the fraud, it
###892 was taking the face away from the crime, if you like.
###896 Wasn't hurting nobody indirectly.
###898 It's luck of the draw.
###899 Because what you do is you're picking people.
###901 You don't know the people you're picking.
###902 You might have a million people, and all you're doing
###905 is just picking the best name that suits yourself.
###907 It's already happened to my mother.
###909 She was the victim of identification fraud, as well.
###912 Not saying that come from none of us, because it never come
###915 from none of us.
###916 But she was.
###917 My family didn't want me to go the way I did.
###919 But you take your own path in life, don't you?
###921 
###924 TONY SALES: Like in a football team, the
###926 striker scores the goal.
###927 Fraud works in exactly the same way where at the end,
###930 sometimes you build everything up, and you just need the last
###933 part of the jigsaw puzzle to put it together.
###936 9 times out of 10, that'll be someone like Kelly.
###938 
###941 Men are men.
###942 They will look at a gorgeous young girl, and they go weak
###945 at the knees.
###947 I can go in and corrupt the girls behind the counter.
###950 But there's a lot more men working stores, and it's
###953 easier for her to go in, flash her boobs, wink--
###957 make the guy feel that he's special.
###959 So she'll come out with 10 times more than what I can
###961 come out with.
###962 KELLY: Listen, I'll go out some little Geary.
###964 He must be about eighteen.
###966 And I'll mug him right off.
###970 
###972 I will use my, what's the word, femininity.
###976 TONY SALES: Femininity.
###977 KELLY: [LAUGHS]
###978 How do you say it?
###979 TONY SALES: Femininity.
###980 KELLY: Femininity.
###981 
###983 I will use that.
###984 Oh, please.
###985 At the end of the day, love, I've
###987 never, ever robbed anybody.
###991 If I could get 50 grand off some silly bank, because I've
###997 got a bit of paperwork, whatever,
###1001 I'm happy to do that.
###1002 I won't get out of my bed for 5,000.
###1007 Would I?
###1007 [LAUGHS]
###1008 TONY SALES: No, you wouldn't.
###1010 You love money too much, man.
###1011 KELLY: (LAUGHING) I wouldn't get out of my bed for it.
###1014 TONY SALES: You know, in that game sometimes people, when
###1017 they get a bit nervous, they turn to drink or drugs to just
###1019 sort of calm their nerves a little bit.
###1021 I think sometimes, a lot of what happens with these people
###1023 is that they've earned so much money in the past, and they've
###1025 had such a good life, that things start to
###1029 spiral out of control.
###1031 Before you know it, the party lifestyle is trying to
###1035 happen every day.
###1036 
###1049 Dave?
###1049 DAVE: Goddamn!
###1051 Tony, come here.
###1052 TONY SALES: Hey, how you doing, mate?
###1053 You all right?
###1054 Yeah, mate, I'm all right.
###1055 You all right?
###1055 This is Dave.
###1056 DAVE COURTNEY: I do apologize about him.
###1058 I was right from the start.
###1059 I blame the parent.
###1062 I've known him a long time.
###1062 When I first met him, I had a fringe.
###1065 This is one of the local heroes of our little block.
###1069 Right?
###1071 He was always, and I mean this most sincerely, a little bit
###1075 smarter than your average bear, Boo-Boo, right?
###1077 He was a little bit above his years.
###1080 TONY SALES: Thank you.
###1080 DAVE COURTNEY: No, I don't mean it nice.
###1081 I looked at you as a threat.
###1082 I hated him.
###1083 I hated him.
###1084 [INAUDIBLE] talking to him [INAUDIBLE] a fancy smile.
###1086 
###1089 Come on, you mastermind.
###1092 Now, I don't have to be the best fraudster.
###1094 'Cause I know him.
###1095 And he don't have to be the best fighter,
###1097 because he can ring me.
###1098 Each to his own.
###1099 Horses for courses, right peg in the right hole.
###1101 I'm a completely different era.
###1103 And the only way to be against the law, or criminal, in them
###1106 days, you all had the same haircut, you all had the flat
###1108 nose, and you was a gangster, you understand what I mean?
###1112 Now, as the world has evolved, everyone's got a little bit
###1114 more sharper.
###1115 You couldn't rob a bank.
###1117 It wouldn't be worth it.
###1118 Because everyone's paying with a check.
###1119 And when I used to do it, some old woman used to give you 200
###1122 grand, and we'd run off down the road.
###1123 And if you was unlucky, a cop would
###1124 chase you with a whistle.
###1126 It was fucking mental.
###1127 Their criminal mind is so sharp.
###1131 They'll crucifying and slaughtering these failsafe
###1132 things that they're doing within hours.
###1136 How could I get away with fraud?
###1137 Look at me.
###1139 Stop it.
###1140 Criminals spend their money very, very fast, because they
###1142 do not understand the concept of saving.
###1146 And when you run out of money, you just then go out
###1149 and nick some more.
###1150 So you don't have to do the saving.
###1151 You know what I mean?
###1153 Although you might not want to be squanderous and slap-happy
###1157 with your money, you can't help it.
###1158 Because it's easy come, easy go.
###1160 And I hate to say that, but it is like that.
###1162 Very much so in Tony's case, with the fraud thing.
###1166 He never, ever believed that that was ever going to stop.
###1169 Otherwise he wouldn't have wasted the money he did on
###1172 what he did.
###1173 He must have thought this would go on forever.
###1175 
###1178 TONY SALES: [INAUDIBLE]
###1179 
###1184 [MAKING GUN NOISES]
###1187 DAVE COURTNEY: Come then.
###1188 Next!
###1189 Yeah, but I can't make a passport.
###1191 I couldn't walk out of a fucking [INAUDIBLE] in
###1193 [INAUDIBLE].
###1194 Unless I went like that, give me the fucking, give me the
###1197 fucking [INAUDIBLE].
###1197 Know what I mean?
###1198 How's that for a fraud?
###1199 Boom.
###1200 
###1211 I'm rubbing my cock on her ankle.
###1213 I'm rubbing my cock on her ankle.
###1215 The illusion that anyone that's on the wrong side of
###1217 the law is more exciting is an illusion, but it definitely is
###1221 an aphrodisiac.
###1222 These little creatures, here, that look like they walked off
###1224 the front of a magazine wouldn't be sitting in my back
###1227 garden, letting me molest her ankle if I was a milkman.
###1231 They make me feel like I'm 25, about 6'8", and Jamaican.
###1235 
###1238 Step this way.
###1239 Look.
###1240 After you.
###1241 Listen, God didn't give you a bum like that
###1243 to walk behind me.
###1244 Fucking hell.
###1245 
###1256 I'm loving the way your legs bend, blondie.
###1259 I'm liking that little bend you do.
###1262 FLORA: I can tell the difference between gangsters
###1266 and them sort of straight guys, just even down to the
###1271 way they talk a lot of the time, and the words they use.
###1274 DAVE COURTNEY: Oh, your fucking legs!
###1277 [LAUGHS]
###1278 FLORA: I just have that side to me that finds it attractive
###1282 or feels excited by them.
###1285 It's not like I were used to that.
###1287 Like when I was a teenager, when I was a kid, I was
###1289 completely innocent.
###1292 I didn't think, oh, I want to hang around gangsters.
###1294 It was just something that happened, really.
###1296 I prefer the fraud side of crime, more than anything
###1303 else, like violence and drugs.
###1305 It is more clever.
###1306 It's finding loopholes in today's society.
###1309 Because on both sides you've got people that are making a
###1312 lot of money.
###1314 And if everyday people can use their brain enough to find a
###1317 way to look after their kids lovely, their girlfriend
###1320 lovely, make a nice house, sometimes I do think, well,
###1324 good on to you.
###1324 You've put enough brain power into it, you've made things
###1328 happen out of nothing.
###1329 And it might be bad to say, but I guess I don't
###1333 mind that too much.
###1334 I know that I've had friends that have had their identity
###1337 stolen and their banks cleared.
###1340 So they will probably hate me for that.
###1343 And I know that's really bad.
###1344 But fraud is more commendable?
###1349 DAVE COURTNEY: It's our duty as a criminal, as soon as
###1353 you're doing something that the rest of the world don't
###1355 like, which is crime, you should at least do it with as
###1358 much dignity, honor, respect, class, quality,
###1363 professionalism, as possible.
###1365 Because what you're doing is scummy, so at
###1367 least do it with honor.
###1370 That'll be a nice one.
###1372 
###1374 Alright, thanks a lot, ladies and gentlemen,
###1375 thank you very much.
###1376 The Courtney Show is over.
###1378 
###1381 TONY SALES: I did tell you that.
###1382 You don't listen to me.
###1383 I told you the other day.
###1384 MINDY: You didn't tell me.
###1384 TONY SALES: I'm not arguing with you.
###1385 MINDY: You were out last Saturday.
###1386 TONY SALES: What are you, my mum?
###1389 MINDY: No, I'm your fucking wife that's sitting here
###1391 looking after your children.
###1393 That's what.
###1394 TONY SALES: Yeah, please, babe, can you do
###1395 that for me, yeah?
###1396 
###1399 Mindy?
###1400 I think she's gone now.
###1401 [LAUGHTER]
###1403 TONY SALES: There's my son, there.
###1406 There's my little boy.
###1407 
###1413 This is where I live now.
###1414 I've obviously moved on from the big houses and the big
###1417 cars and stuff.
###1419 Now I'm trying to change my life around and go legit.
###1422 It's a lot harder than when you're just
###1424 taking stuff for free.
###1426 The thought of going and getting it for financial gain
###1429 doesn't bother me in the slightest.
###1432 But actually deceiving my wife and my family is the one thing
###1437 that got to me more than anything.
###1440 Born on the same day as me.
###1441 
###1444 He's a good boy, though.
###1445 He's not going to be a naughty one.
###1446 Aren't you?
###1447 Hey.
###1448 Go on.
###1450 
###1452 I've started a company now to prevent fraud.
###1455 KELLY: [LAUGHS]
###1464 TONY SALES: I have.
###1465 I've gone straight, Kel.
###1466 And now I've got my own company called RID Fraud.
###1469 KELLY: [LAUGHS]
###1472 TONY SALES: And it specializes in dealing
###1474 with identity theft.
###1477 And we're going to teach companies that we used to
###1480 whack how to stop it.
###1483 For real.
###1484 KELLY: Can I have a job?
