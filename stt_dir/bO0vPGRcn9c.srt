Yeah, we all know Greece
is messed up, but how


8
0:0:37,33 --> 0:0:39,29
did it get this bad?


9
0:0:39,29 --> 0:0:42,68
In 2009, national debt
threateners turned Greece into


10
0:0:42,68 --> 0:0:44,19
a failed state.


11
0:0:44,19 --> 0:0:47,19
Decades of endemic economic
corruption had finally caught

0:0:47,19 --> 0:0:48,47
up with the place.

volatile, it threatened the

0:0:50,89 --> 0:0:53,47
entire future of the Euro.


15
0:0:53,47 --> 0:0:56,18
Europe scrabbled together
billion-dollar bailouts, but


16
0:0:56,18 --> 0:0:59,0
they came with orders of
austerity, demands of huge


17
0:0:59,0 --> 0:1:1,81
cutbacks in public spending and

A two-day general strike
was called.


25

So we flew to Athens, bought
a bunch of gas masks, and


26
0:1:38,81 --> 0:1:42,43
wandered into a fight at the
center of a European tragedy.

who asked us not to identify


31

him due to his history of
violent clashes with police.

This is Syntagma Square, where
Greek Parliament stands.


34

In June 2011, as Greece face
bankruptcy, violent battles


35
0:2:28,37 --> 0:2:31,56
took place here between police
and protesters, as the prime


36
0:2:31,56 --> 0:2:34,33
minister, George Papandreou
forced an austerity bill


37
0:2:34,33 --> 0:2:37,54

Between the Square and the
Parliament, the desperadoes


39
0:2:40,35 --> 0:2:41,55
would be standing.


40

They're the normal people,
protesting for the first time.


41
0:2:44,29 --> 0:2:46,49
The more militant members of
the march kind of dismissed


42
0:2:46,49 --> 0:2:47,81
them as moobs.


43
0:2:47,81 --> 0:2:50,4
The students will be marching
from the university library,


44
0:2:50,4 --> 0:2:53,4
presumably with a hilarious
banner or two.

0:2:53,4 --> 0:2:55,27
The Communists will be
starting from here.

There are loads of
indistinguishable Communist


47

subgroups called things like
PAME, but no one really


48
0:3:0,27 --> 0:3:2,53
understands the difference
between them.


49

This is Exarcheia,
which the media


50
0:3:4,7 --> 0:3:5,37
describes as a rebel lair.


51
0:3:5,37 --> 0:3:8,42
It's from this sector of squats
and occupied buildings


52
0:3:8,42 --> 0:3:10,82
that the anarchists will
start their day.


53
0:3:10,82 --> 0:3:12,82
The union workers will
begin from here,


54
0:3:12,82 --> 0:3:14,38
marching through Exarcheia.


55

there'll probability be a

Everybody's heading for Syntagma
Square, where the


58
0:3:20,34 --> 0:3:22,95

defending Parliament with

On the other side of Syntagma
Square, a van had been


65
0:4:52,1 --> 0:4:54,42
trundling along the streets with
megaphones blaring the


66
0:4:54,42 --> 0:4:58,21

the workers' militant front.

really don't like.

They did it to Mussolini
in 1940.


73
0:5:48,29 --> 0:5:50,8
Then there was a coup
d'etat in 1967 and a


74
0:5:50,8 --> 0:5:55,56
student uprising in 1973.


75
0:5:55,56 --> 0:5:57,88
You can see why the Greek
authorities might be nervous


76
0:5:57,88 --> 0:5:59,11
of their people.


77
0:5:59,11 --> 0:6:1,66
Maybe that's why they employ one
of the most hated police


78

forces in all of Europe, one
with a reputation for


79
0:6:4,14 --> 0:6:7,4

connections to the local


80
0:6:7,4 --> 0:6:9,16

Depending on who you ask,
Greece's tradition of violent


82
0:6:11,89 --> 0:6:14,99

cause of police brutality


83
0:6:14,99 --> 0:6:17,88
or a natural revolutionary
reaction to authoritarian
