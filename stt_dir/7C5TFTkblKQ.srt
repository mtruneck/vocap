Could a strange substance found by a southwest

That's the question at the heart of a phenomenon

That's interesting Dale and Christina, this
is of interest not only in this country but


16

it.

Well, Dave, you mentioned that climatologists


19
0:1:41,45 --> 0:1:46,509
and others who study the atmosphere believe
that they would be able to surely spot any


20
0:1:46,509 --> 0:1:48,81
kinds of signs of an ominous plot.

Narrator – Michael J. Murphy
Our journey started in San Diego, California


22
0:1:51,45 --> 0:1:55,59
where thousands of scientists, engineers,
policy-makers, and journalists gathered for


23
0:1:55,59 --> 0:1:59,759
The American Association for the Advancement
of Science Conference. One of the topics was


24
0:1:59,759 --> 0:2:3,97
the artificial manipulation of the Earth's
climate, also called geoengineering. During


25
0:2:3,97 --> 0:2:9,819
the meeting, scientists spoke about he plausibility
of implementing geoengineering campaigns throughout


26
0:2:9,819 --> 0:2:14,28
the world, under the guise of preventing global
warming. One widely accepted theory was to


27
0:2:14,28 --> 0:2:19,0
block the sun by spraying something into the
atmosphere. When they were asked about existing


28
0:2:19,0 --> 0:2:23,78
aerosol programs they stated clearly that
no such programs had ever been implemented.


29
0:2:23,78 --> 0:2:28,79
But strangely, these proposals sounded exactly
like what people around the world are claiming


30
0:2:28,79 --> 0:2:29,64
is already happening.


31
0:2:29,64 --> 0:2:33,489
Stewart Howe – Journalist
When I found out that the American Association


32
0:2:33,489 --> 0:2:38,92
for the Advancement of Science was going to
be held down here and the main body of topics


33
0:2:38,92 --> 0:2:44,9
would be on geoengineering, I had to come.
I had to be in on this. I had to hear what


34
0:2:44,9 --> 0:2:47,879
these top climate change scientists had to
say.


35
0:2:47,879 --> 0:2:52,37
AAAS Conference Panelist
As to the other question about chemtrails


36
0:2:52,37 --> 0:3:2,519
and whether geoengineering would be deployed
right now with or without our knowledge, I


37
0:3:2,519 --> 0:3:7,67
think, it's my personal insight that, other
than to say I work in government at pretty


38
0:3:7,67 --> 0:3:11,9
high levels, at the White House and in state
government and I am personally skeptical of


39
0:3:11,9 --> 0:3:14,1
that. But honestly, you never know with government.


40
0:3:14,1 --> 0:3:16,69

Chemtrails. On the internet they are cited


41
0:3:16,69 --> 0:3:19,249
as proof of the government creating clouds
to combat global warming.

43
0:3:20,209 --> 0:3:25,49
They claim the American government with the
secret approval of the national government


44
0:3:25,49 --> 0:3:32,4
is covertly using jet aircraft to spray population
centers with aluminum, with barium, and with


45
0:3:32,4 --> 0:3:37,62
strontium so as to reduce people's humility
and to reduce the global population.


46

Yes, I'm always a little bit suspicious because


47
0:3:40,659 --> 0:3:45,23
the government doesn't seem that capable to
do something on such a large scale, you know?


48

Weather Webcast Channel 10 (location unknown)
That is not rain, that is not snow. Believe


49
0:3:47,889 --> 0:3:53,209
it or not military aircraft flying through
the region is dropping chaff, small bits of


50
0:3:53,209 --> 0:3:58,76
aluminum, sometimes it's made of plastic or
even metalicized [sic] paper products, but


51
0:3:58,76 --> 0:4:2,879
its use is an antiradar issue and obviously
they're up there practicing. Now they won't


52
0:4:2,879 --> 0:4:6,189
confirm that but I was in the marine corp
for many years, and I'll tell you right now.


53
0:4:6,189 --> 0:4:6,519
That's what it is.


54
0:4:6,519 --> 0:4:8,4

Now what happens here is military jets come


55
0:4:8,4 --> 0:4:13,569
out of Key West Air Force Base and move off
into the atmosphere and drop mylar strips.


56
0:4:13,569 --> 0:4:18,75
Some could be a little wider, some are small
glass fibers that are coated in aluminum.


57
0:4:18,75 --> 0:4:22,78
What the Air Force does is they take their
military jets and they dump these out of the


58
0:4:22,78 --> 0:4:26,52
aircraft and they fall into the atmosphere,
and some take as much as a day to fall down.

This is inevitably military or something going


60
0:4:30,84 --> 0:4:34,97
on. The government, the Air Force. When you
see this kind of pattern like this you can


61
0:4:34,97 --> 0:4:39,419
rest assured there's something going on. They're
actually little bitty magnetic, little bitty

While it's a nuisance to you and I, to determine

it's a lifesaving operation by the military.

Order, order, I cannot hear.


68
0:4:55,389 --> 0:4:59,11

Mr. Speaker, I want to assure the House, that


69
0:4:59,11 --> 0:5:3,86
both my ministry and my colleague, the Minister
of Health who have received correspondence


70
0:5:3,86 --> 0:5:10,76
on this issue, that this conspiracy theory
does not have an iota of truth and that the


71
0:5:10,76 --> 0:5:15,33
trails observed from aircraft simply come
from jet engines. [laughing]


72

Speaker
Number Nine, order.


73
0:5:18,729 --> 0:5:21,9

And I think what an appalling example it is


74
0:5:21,9 --> 0:5:26,319
of the new Thoroughfare Spokesperson for the
Labor Party that she's spreading conspiracy


75
0:5:26,319 --> 0:5:27,86
theories about the United States government.


76
0:5:27,86 --> 0:5:31,21

I think this House has heard sufficient.

Webcast explanation of geoengineering
Narrator


78
0:5:33,419 --> 0:5:38,8
It is called geoengineering, fighting global
warming by putting chemical dust in the atmosphere


79
0:5:38,8 --> 0:5:41,56
and reflecting harmful radiation back into
space.


80
0:5:41,56 --> 0:5:44,97
New speaker
We take geoengineering to mean deliberate


81
0:5:44,97 --> 0:5:46,259
large scale intervention in Earth's system.


82

Online video of John Holdren – Advisor to
President Barack Obama in Science and Technology


83
0:5:47,349 --> 0:5:53,8
There are a variety of schemes that have been
discussed for geoengineering. A classic example


84
0:5:53,8 --> 0:5:57,479
is injecting reflecting particles into Earth
orbit.


85
0:5:57,479 --> 0:5:58,46
Web video featuring David Keith, University
of Calgary Geoengineer


86
0:5:58,46 --> 0:6:0,759
Nevertheless there might be good reason to
be thinking about aluminum. It turns out there's


87
0:6:0,759 --> 0:6:4,569
been a lot of work on the environmental consequences
of aluminum in the stratosphere. The big deal


88
0:6:4,569 --> 0:6:9,56
really is that aluminum has four times the
volumetric rate for forcing in the small particles


89
0:6:9,56 --> 0:6:11,59
as does sulfur and that
David Keith


90
0:6:11,59 --> 0:6:15,68
means you have four times the surface area
for the same radial forcing. And this is a


91
0:6:15,68 --> 0:6:20,9
much bigger deal, that you have roughly sixteen
times less the coagulation rate. That's the


92
0:6:20,9 --> 0:6:23,879
thing that really drives removal so you can
get away, we think, with much smaller mass


93
0:6:23,879 --> 0:6:24,139
levels.


94
0:6:24,139 --> 0:6:27,479
Stewart Howe
So that's why we see things like in the Hughes


95
0:6:27,479 --> 0:6:32,789
Aircraft patent from '89, they talked about
aluminum so that's why we're seeing in the


96
0:6:32,789 --> 0:6:37,59
surface water samples aluminum, and here's
David Keith saying that aluminum has four


97
0:6:37,59 --> 0:6:45,3
times the reflective volume surface area.
So they'd like us to think that we're talking


98
0:6:45,3 --> 0:6:50,199
about sulfur, and here they slipped up and
let it out that aluminum is four times better


99
0:6:50,199 --> 0:6:55,74
to achieving their ends and it sounds like
it's the one thing they don't want us to know


100
0:6:55,74 --> 0:6:56,539
the effects of.


101
0:6:56,539 --> 0:6:59,15
David Keith
The little picture is from a nanofabrication


102
0:6:59,15 --> 0:7:3,169
study which shows that you could make very
high quality, do this with a jet in just a


103
0:7:3,169 --> 0:7:7,75
very simple way, to make aluminum particles
by spraying aluminum vapor out which oxidizes


104
0:7:7,75 --> 0:7:10,669
so it's certainly, in principle, possible
to do that so there's a big literature that's


105
0:7:10,669 --> 0:7:15,6
already looked at that. And you could do that
by either building new versions of these aircraft


106
0:7:15,6 --> 0:7:18,849
or even re-engineering existing aircraft.
So there's some ideas about, you go to an


107
0:7:18,849 --> 0:7:23,9
engineering firm and you want this done, they
don't say it's hard or unusual they say, okay,


108
0:7:23,9 --> 0:7:28,889
yes, we could do it. Aerosol geoengineering
looks like it's so cheap that cost is basically


109
0:7:28,889 --> 0:7:32,599
not going to be an issue. That means that
implementation decisions will be risk to risk


110
0:7:32,599 --> 0:7:36,77
decisions. The risk of doing it against the
risk of not doing it. It makes the problem


111
0:7:36,77 --> 0:7:41,659
of how we govern it fundamentally harder and
different and um. So I've told you that it's


112
0:7:41,659 --> 0:7:44,229
cheap to deliver materials to the stratosphere
and I'm convinced that's true, I don't think


113
0:7:44,229 --> 0:7:48,86
that will change. But I think the more we
do research the less easy this will look,


114
0:7:48,86 --> 0:7:53,0
the more complicated the environmental effects
will look and that's a good thing because


115
0:7:53,0 --> 0:7:58,219
right now, it looks too easy. So I think if
we do more research we're likely to find out


116
0:7:58,219 --> 0:8:2,229
that it's harder and more complicated than
we thought and side effects are harder to


117
0:8:2,229 --> 0:8:7,71
manage and that's a healthy outcome that will
make it easier to do the management. Of course


118
0:8:7,71 --> 0:8:11,669
the opposite reaction is possible. It's an
empirical question how people will actually


119
0:8:11,669 --> 0:8:15,419
react to knowledge about this. And if their
reaction is to say these crazy scientists


120
0:8:15,419 --> 0:8:18,229
are so concerned about putting CO2 in the
atmosphere they want to think about these


121
0:8:18,229 --> 0:8:22,52
things and that might actually mean we ought
to be more serious about the risk of CO2 in


122
0:8:22,52 --> 0:8:25,699
the atmosphere. And by the way it's not really
a moral hazard it's more like free riding


123
0:8:25,699 --> 0:8:28,2
on our grandkids.


124
0:8:28,2 --> 0:8:36,7
Dane Wigington
Recent air quality studies including CARB


125
0:8:36,7 --> 0:8:41,11
California Air Quality Resource Board have
named submicron-sized particulates as being


126
0:8:41,11 --> 0:8:44,72
particularly harmful for human respiration.
Through all the


127
0:8:44,72 --> 0:8:48,29
Dane Wigington
discussions today I have not heard any mention


128
0:8:48,29 --> 0:8:53,85
of this fallout, and has this been studied
and also the effects of a highly reactive


129
0:8:53,85 --> 0:8:57,53
metal like aluminum on toxifying soils and
waters?


130
0:8:57,53 --> 0:8:59,64
Alan Robock – Geoengineer
The question is what would be the effects


131
0:8:59,64 --> 0:9:7,6
of these materials on human health if they
come on down into the stratosphere in particular,


132
0:9:7,6 --> 0:9:8,37
small particles of aluminum?


133
0:9:8,37 --> 0:9:10,74
David Keith
So that the collaborators of mine working


134
0:9:10,74 --> 0:9:14,37
on the aerosol scheme are actually folks from
Carnegie Mellon who've focused on human health


135
0:9:14,37 --> 0:9:17,87
impacts and while we haven't published it
that was the very first thing we did was to


136
0:9:17,87 --> 0:9:22,8
do the order of magnitude calculation not
with pencil and paper but with an expert on


137
0:9:22,8 --> 0:9:27,17
human health impacts on whether there could
be a human health issue and for aluminum and


138
0:9:27,17 --> 0:9:30,389
a lot of other particles there are a lot of
toxicological things that they need to get


139
0:9:30,389 --> 0:9:33,829
looked at seriously. But if you're thinking
just about the sheer number of particles,


140
0:9:33,829 --> 0:9:38,43
the human health impact, the answer is while
we haven't published I, that was the first


141
0:9:38,43 --> 0:9:43,17
thing we looked at with some of the leading
experts who do epidemiological research on


142
0:9:43,17 --> 0:9:45,66
human health impacts and it's not even close
to an issue.


143
0:9:45,66 --> 0:9:47,57
Dane Wigington
So let me clarify, so ten megatons of aluminum


144
0:9:47,57 --> 0:9:51,7
dumped into the atmosphere would have no human
health impacts?


145
0:9:51,7 --> 0:9:56,279
David Keith
So let me be more careful here. Let's separate


146
0:9:56,279 --> 0:10:1,829
out the toxicological. The alumina we've only
begun to research and published nothing.


147
0:10:1,829 --> 0:10:12,57
Mike Murphy to Stewart Howe
Dane looked at him and said, so you're telling


148
0:10:12,57 --> 0:10:18,36
me that spraying ten to twenty megatons of
aluminum as you said, would have no human


149
0:10:18,36 --> 0:10:22,75
health effects? He took a deep breath and
he swallowed and said, 'Let me be more careful


150
0:10:22,75 --> 0:10:23,4
here.'


151
0:10:23,4 --> 0:10:25,97
David Keith
We haven't done anything serious on alumina


152
0:10:25,97 --> 0:10:29,839
and so there could be something terrible that
we'll find tomorrow that we haven't looked


153
0:10:29,839 --> 0:10:29,839
at.


154
0:10:29,839 --> 0:10:34,399
Mike Murphy
And that, for me was the whole main point


155
0:10:34,399 --> 0:10:40,12
of what's going to be coming out to the public.
It's the damaging effects of aluminum that's


156
0:10:40,12 --> 0:10:45,7
being found around the world in massive amounts,
and here's David Keith, confronted on this


157
0:10:45,7 --> 0:10:50,54
very issue and he looked, at that point, like
they just let the cat out of the bag.


158
0:10:50,54 --> 0:10:53,399
Reiterating David Keith
We haven't done anything serious on alumina


159
0:10:53,399 --> 0:10:57,25
and so there could be something terrible that
we find tomorrow that we haven't looked at.


160
0:10:57,25 --> 0:11:0,399
Stewart Howe to Mike Murphy
They're proceeding because they have an agenda


161
0:11:0,399 --> 0:11:5,68
that's separate from trying to thwart this
crisis of global warming. You know there's


162
0:11:5,68 --> 0:11:12,94
obviously several other objectives whether
it's depopulation, control, weapons aspects,


163
0:11:12,94 --> 0:11:16,51
communications aspects, it's all kinds of
things, you know, wild cards that we know


164
0:11:16,51 --> 0:11:21,62
nothing about. We don't really know and I'm
not going to attempt to speculate on exactly


165
0:11:21,62 --> 0:11:31,4
what the agendas are but we can see clearly
the agendas are not benefiting mankind. It's


166
0:11:31,4 --> 0:11:32,68
benefiting the agenda of the elite.


167
0:11:32,68 --> 0:11:34,959
Ken Caldeira – Geoengineer
And so I think the question is how do you


168
0:11:34,959 --> 0:11:41,47
draw the line between some activity that is
allowed and doesn't need global governance


169
0:11:41,47 --> 0:11:44,829
and activities that do require global governance?


170

0:11:57,8 --> 0:12:0,97
Dr. John Holdren
My personal opinion is that we have to keep


174
0:12:0,97 --> 0:12:4,779
geoengineering on the table. We have to look
at it very carefully because we might get


175
0:12:4,779 --> 0:12:7,25
desperate enough to want to use it.


176
0:12:7,25 --> 0:12:12,26
“FORA tv” Webcast
So what would we do if in the year 2040 or


177
0:12:12,26 --> 0:12:18,24
2060 there's a severe climate crisis, say
widespread famines or Greenland's sliding,


178
0:12:18,24 --> 0:12:25,529
suddenly into the ocean that the only plausible
way in which we could start the Earth cooling


179
0:12:25,529 --> 0:12:31,5
this century is to directly intervene in the
climate system, say by putting particles in


180
0:12:31,5 --> 0:12:31,69
the stratosphere.


181
0:12:31,69 --> 0:12:32,579
M. Granger Morgan, Department of Engineering
and Public Policy, Carnegie Mellon University


182
0:12:32,579 --> 0:12:37,11
We do stuff in the stratosphere all the time
of course, and so it's not as though the stratosphere


183
0:12:37,11 --> 0:12:42,31
is absolutely pristine. But you don't want
to have people going off and doing things


184
0:12:42,31 --> 0:12:47,73
that involve large radiative forcings or go
on for extended periods, or for that matter


185
0:12:47,73 --> 0:12:52,279
that provide lots of reactive surfaces that
could result in significant ozone destruction.


186
0:12:52,279 --> 0:12:55,25
“FORA tv” webcast
You know, maybe I'm putting a particle into


187
0:12:55,25 --> 0:13:0,16
the atmosphere because I'm trying to make
money, or maybe I'm putting a particle into


188
0:13:0,16 --> 0:13:5,19
the atmosphere because I'm engaging in scientific
research, trying to understand cloud physics


189
0:13:5,19 --> 0:13:9,44
or maybe I'm putting this particle into the
atmosphere because I'm trying to make it rain


190
0:13:9,44 --> 0:13:17,3
locally, to seed a cloud and get more snow
on our ski slopes. And this obviously raises


191
0:13:17,3 --> 0:13:24,209
all kinds of questions. It's usually risky.
It will likely negatively impact some people,


192
0:13:24,209 --> 0:13:30,269
but we might find ourselves in a situation
where those risks seem worth taking.


193
0:13:30,269 --> 0:13:31,459
Mike Murphy talking to Stewart Howe and Jeremy
Rothe-Kushel


194
0:13:31,459 --> 0:13:37,259
One of the things that really shocked me was
in one of the breakouts they had the benefits


195
0:13:37,259 --> 0:13:41,73
of these programs and then the risks. Now,
of the benefits, the one thing that was stated


196
0:13:41,73 --> 0:13:48,47
was the, just cooling the planet. Some of
the risks were ozone depletion, droughts in


197
0:13:48,47 --> 0:13:49,79
Africa and Asia.


198
0:13:49,79 --> 0:13:54,35
Stewart Howe
I gotta tell ya, I came away from this experience


199
0:13:54,35 --> 0:14:3,35
after listening to these scientists for four
days of symposiums really concerned because


200
0:14:3,35 --> 0:14:14,459
it's clear now that they are justifying, rationalizing,
and looking to legitimize some really really


201
0:14:14,459 --> 0:14:22,259
horrible impacts, further impacts on our environment,
and they're basically formulating the sales


202
0:14:22,259 --> 0:14:27,709
strategy and the implementation and oversight
strategy and the funding strategy.


203
0:14:27,709 --> 0:14:30,97
Mike Murphy
After San Diego, I was shocked by the programs


204
0:14:30,97 --> 0:14:35,69
that had been proposed so I decided to write
about it and that night when I finished I


205
0:14:35,69 --> 0:14:39,74
sent the article to an online publication
with my email address attached. When I woke


206
0:14:39,74 --> 0:14:44,62
up the next morning, my inbox was flooded
with responses from around the world. Why?


207
0:14:44,62 --> 0:14:49,22
Because I had just broken the story on aluminum
in geoengineering models, which I had no clue


208
0:14:49,22 --> 0:14:54,79
at the time that very few people knew about.
Now this metal aluminum is being found in


209
0:14:54,79 --> 0:15:0,399
massive quantities, way above normal levels
all over in rain, in soil, and in snow. After


210
0:15:0,399 --> 0:15:5,19
that, the calls came pouring in from people
who were desperate for someone to investigate.


211
0:15:5,19 --> 0:15:9,87
That was the fuel that started the film. Before
we started filming we had the opportunity


212
0:15:9,87 --> 0:15:14,43
to sit down with one of our favorite authors
and documentarians, G. Edward Griffin, to


213
0:15:14,43 --> 0:15:17,54
find out what he knew about the subject.


214
0:15:17,54 --> 0:15:22,759
Mike Murphy
I'd like to talk for a minute about an issue


215
0:15:22,759 --> 0:15:26,54
that's getting more and more attention and
that's the issue which scientifically is called


216
0:15:26,54 --> 0:15:31,79
“stratospheric aerosol geoengineering”
also called the chemtrail issue.


217
0:15:31,79 --> 0:15:33,86
G. Edward Griffin
I am very well aware of the chemtrail versus


218
0:15:33,86 --> 0:15:41,0
contrail controversy. As far as I am concerned,
it's an open and shut case. I have been watching


219
0:15:41,0 --> 0:15:46,89
the development of jet travel from its very
beginning. I used to live near the Los Angeles


220
0:15:46,89 --> 0:15:51,8
airport and remember when the first jets came
in and landed, and man! They make a big noise!


221
0:15:51,8 --> 0:15:56,18
We'd never heard a noise like that before.
And we used to go down and sit at the end


222
0:15:56,18 --> 0:16:2,38
of the runway and watch these jets come in
and take off because it was a novel experience.


223
0:16:2,38 --> 0:16:9,94
I've been watching jets all my life and I
know about jet contrails. I've watched them.


224
0:16:9,94 --> 0:16:16,759
They're vaporized moisture, ice crystals,
and they get out there in the atmosphere and


225
0:16:16,759 --> 0:16:22,5
they effervesce and evaporate and then they
disappear, and you can see them. The plane


226
0:16:22,5 --> 0:16:27,24
moves along and the little white trail follows
along right behind it, usually about ten to


227
0:16:27,24 --> 0:16:31,769
twenty lengths behind the plane or thereabouts
and then it's gone. And you can still see


228
0:16:31,769 --> 0:16:35,62
them that way, by the way, once in awhile,
and it's “there goes a contrail”. These


229
0:16:35,62 --> 0:16:39,97
other things we're talking about are not at
all the same phenomena, at all. These planes


230
0:16:39,97 --> 0:16:46,449
go by and they billow out this white smoke
and it covers the sky from horizon to horizon


231
0:16:46,449 --> 0:16:51,92
and it doesn't dissipate at all. And they
criss cross each other, and you see this thing


232
0:16:51,92 --> 0:16:54,61
cover the sky and turn it milky G. Edward
Griffin


233
0:16:54,61 --> 0:17:0,139
and people start to have trouble breathing
and then you hear the stories about the aluminum


234
0:17:0,139 --> 0:17:4,1
and barium deposits that they're picking up
in the residue and you put it all together


235
0:17:4,1 --> 0:17:11,17
and I don't see how anybody who's got their
eyes open and their mind open can come to


236
0:17:11,17 --> 0:17:17,31
any other conclusion but that somebody is
spending a lot of money and effort to spray


237
0:17:17,31 --> 0:17:22,4
the planet. And my question is why? I've got
my own theories but I hope that there will


238
0:17:22,4 --> 0:17:28,569
be some good investigative reporters go out
there and get us the answer. I know that whenever


239
0:17:28,569 --> 0:17:33,0
it's finally discovered, and it will be, the
people who are doing it will undoubtedly say


240
0:17:33,0 --> 0:17:38,71
“Oh, we did it for you folks, for the greater
good of the greater number. It's for society.”


241
0:17:38,71 --> 0:17:44,25
It's probably to prevent global warming or
maybe it's to inoculate the people against


242
0:17:44,25 --> 0:17:48,29
a dreaded biological attack. “We can't go
around shooting everybody in the arm but we


243
0:17:48,29 --> 0:17:54,26
can spray them and save their lives. You see
how good we are? We're doing it for the benefit


244
0:17:54,26 --> 0:17:57,9
of society.” I know they're going to, whatever
it is, they're going to say it was for your


245
0:17:57,9 --> 0:17:58,39
good and mine.


246

Photos from Webcasts sources unclear at AAAS
Conference, featuring Ken Caldeira, Geoengineer


247
0:17:59,62 --> 0:18:4,419
Think of this, if we had the ability to steer
hurricanes, and a hurricane was going to slam


248
0:18:4,419 --> 0:18:14,419
into New Orleans. And let's say you could
steer it so that it would hit Mississippi


249
0:18:14,419 --> 0:18:20,24
instead where for a hundred, that means I
would be willing to more or less kill say


250
0:18:20,24 --> 0:18:27,95
eighteen Mississippians to save eighteen hundred
New Orleanians. And if you do that deliberately,


251
0:18:27,95 --> 0:18:33,11
you know, are you murdering those hundred
people, and there's all kinds of equity issues


252
0:18:33,11 --> 0:18:33,27
there.


253
0:18:33,27 --> 0:18:36,57
“FORA tv” Webcast
Now also, we might be wrong about our steering


254
0:18:36,57 --> 0:18:42,64
and if we didn't do the research right, maybe
our steering would intensify Katrina, and


255
0:18:42,64 --> 0:18:48,75
kill even more people in New Orleans and so
this question of how you develop the confidence


256
0:18:48,75 --> 0:18:55,53
so you know your intervention will reduce
overall damage and then how do you deal with


257
0:18:55,53 --> 0:19:0,0
the understanding that that you have damaged
more people who wouldn't have been damaged


258
0:19:0,0 --> 0:19:3,159
before while saving people overall?


259
0:19:3,159 --> 0:19:4,45
G. Edward Griffin – in discussion again
with Mike Murphy


260
0:19:4,45 --> 0:19:8,89
The spraying appears to be mostly in NATO
countries. I've seen it here in the United


261
0:19:8,89 --> 0:19:14,87
States, I've seen it in England, I've seen
it in Scotland, I've seen it in Canada and


262
0:19:14,87 --> 0:19:20,7
I've had reports from people who live in France.
There's a grouping. There's a political grouping


263
0:19:20,7 --> 0:19:27,24
here of some sort and it's international in
scope. It's not just a national phenomena


264
0:19:27,24 --> 0:19:32,159
and anyone who wants to investigate that,
I think, has to take that fact into consideration.


265
0:19:32,159 --> 0:19:37,38
They're going to find a political grouping
and a political motive here. But in my humble


266
0:19:37,38 --> 0:19:44,12
opinion, it's not for your good or mine at
all. But whatever it is, we'll soon find out.


267
0:19:44,12 --> 0:19:54,179
I'm sure if you follow the old advice, which
is to follow the money, you'll come to the


268
0:19:54,179 --> 0:19:55,909
answer sooner or later.


269
0:19:55,909 --> 0:19:59,26
Mike Murphy
Soon we realized that we all shared the same


270
0:19:59,26 --> 0:20:3,22
need to get this information out there, to
share with the public, to let people know


271
0:20:3,22 --> 0:20:8,33
what's being done. Ed felt so passionately
about this issue, he offered to help us.


272
0:20:8,33 --> 0:20:10,2
G. Edward Griffin
Well, the main thing now, since it looks like


273
0:20:10,2 --> 0:20:17,289
the budget is going to be met, is to get it
done well. We don't come off the tree knowing


274
0:20:17,289 --> 0:20:18,19
any answers at all.


275
0:20:18,19 --> 0:20:19,23
Mike Murphy
Yeah, we're not scientists. We're just asking


276
0:20:19,23 --> 0:20:19,47
questions. Exactly.


277
0:20:19,47 --> 0:20:25,21
G. Edward Griffin
And we're very skeptical about the answers.


278
0:20:25,21 --> 0:20:33,49
That's being totally accurate, totally honest.
Why can't people see this? They're not hearing


279
0:20:33,49 --> 0:20:34,36
it. They don't know. The facts are not being
presented to them. We're very lucky, do you


280
0:20:34,36 --> 0:20:43,11
know that? Look at this opportunity that's
been dumped on us.


281
0:20:43,11 --> 0:20:44,95
Mike Murphy
I know.


282
0:20:44,95 --> 0:20:47,25
G. Edward Griffin
[laughs] Opportunity.


283
0:20:47,25 --> 0:20:49,59
Mike Murphy
It's going to be a battle, I know that.


284
0:20:49,59 --> 0:20:51,75
G. Edward Griffin
A challenge and a battle, I know that. And


285
0:20:51,75 --> 0:20:54,7
why are we here if it's not for them?

DJ to Mike Murphy and audience


287
0:21:0,63 --> 0:21:9,22
I've seen the sky criss-crossed with chemtrails
and I don't remember if it was in LA or on


288
0:21:9,22 --> 0:21:15,38
the road, but I looked up one day and I thought,
look at that! That's not the flight path man!


289
0:21:15,38 --> 0:21:20,58
It was a grid, a grid, a regular grid over
the city and I couldn't believe my eyes!

Milky white clouds.


291
0:21:21,45 --> 0:21:23,82
Caller
And you know it all seems so obvious and the


292
0:21:23,82 --> 0:21:27,89
evidence of what we have on the ground with
the aluminum, the barium, and the strontium,


293
0:21:27,89 --> 0:21:32,46
and with what we see in the patents and what
the geoengineers say are going to happen and


294
0:21:32,46 --> 0:21:35,11
for the everyday Joe, this is a slam dunk.


295
0:21:35,11 --> 0:21:37,59
Mauro Oliveira Geoengineeringwatch.org
This is a very delicate moment for the powers


296
0:21:37,59 --> 0:21:44,45
that be because they're taking a very covered-up
operation like the tropospheric aerosol program


297
0:21:44,45 --> 0:21:49,789
or chemtrails, Project Icharius or however
many names it's had over the years and they're


298
0:21:49,789 --> 0:22:0,45
making overt into a geoengineering scientific
shield to deflect sunlight because global


299
0:22:0,45 --> 0:22:4,9
warming is out of hand. So, at this very moment,
the belly of the beast is right above us with


300
0:22:4,9 --> 0:22:14,429
no armor. Whether people believe in chemtrails
or not, the geoengineering should be scary


301
0:22:14,429 --> 0:22:19,85
enough and when people learn about geoengineering,
the chemtrails will then become apparent because,


302
0:22:19,85 --> 0:22:20,14
they're the same.

Mike Murphy Narrating


308
0:22:23,87 --> 0:22:28,7
We're off to Redding, California. This is
the second step after the AAAS meeting and


309
0:22:28,7 --> 0:22:42,4
we'll see what we find. We're out here in
Northern California at Dane Wigington's house


310
0:22:42,4 --> 0:22:48,279
he owns over 2000 acres overlooking Lake Shasta
and he told me about some of the challenges


311
0:22:48,279 --> 0:22:54,11
that they're having up here. Let's go talk
to Dane and see what's going on on his property.


312
0:22:54,11 --> 0:22:58,76
We'll see what he's going through and also
what action he's taking based on the test


313
0:22:58,76 --> 0:23:1,51
results that he has.


314
0:23:1,51 --> 0:23:8,919
Dane Wigington
You know I have a background in the energy


315
0:23:8,919 --> 0:23:14,789
fields. I worked in the first solar plants
in the continental US in the early 80s. My


316
0:23:14,789 --> 0:23:19,46
home was on the cover of the world's largest
renewable energy magazine so this is my background.


317
0:23:19,46 --> 0:23:25,82
My goal has been to alert the public. There's
a mountain of toxic material falling on us,


318
0:23:25,82 --> 0:23:31,299
period. Four or five years ago, our skies
were typically blue but now you see it's covered


319
0:23:31,299 --> 0:23:36,94
with lines and haze and virtually nothing
you see on the horizon, nothing you see in


320
0:23:36,94 --> 0:23:42,679
the sky above us is a natural cloud. I mean
it is virtually all the remnants of these


321
0:23:42,679 --> 0:23:49,539
aircraft lines that you see fanning out, spreading
into clouds, artificial clouds, but the sky


322
0:23:49,539 --> 0:23:55,89
has a very dirty look to it. It is not the
white clouds blue sky that we had only a few


323
0:23:55,89 --> 0:24:1,299
years ago, but it looks like we had some sort
of massive industrial activity or forest fires


324
0:24:1,299 --> 0:24:5,669
burning over there and we see that, typically,
every night. You see even down to ground level


325
0:24:5,669 --> 0:24:14,27
the clarity drops off significantly and we
don't see that except for the days when we


326
0:24:14,27 --> 0:24:21,51
have these long lingering trails that spread
and cover the whole sky and on certain days


327
0:24:21,51 --> 0:24:27,679
you can see these trails dropping vertically
like a veil. We assume the particulates are


328
0:24:27,679 --> 0:24:34,38
descending and we have the tests to prove
we are being inundated with levels of aluminum


329
0:24:34,38 --> 0:24:37,86
in particulates that are literally tens of
thousands of times what would already be considered


330
0:24:37,86 --> 0:24:46,52
high. So we're not talking about exposure
to a slight percentage higher of these toxic


331
0:24:46,52 --> 0:24:51,9
materials. We're talking about quantities
for example off the side of Mt. Shasta. If


332
0:24:51,9 --> 0:24:55,23
you could pan back [motioning off to the distance].
That's a landmark in Northern California,


333
0:24:55,23 --> 0:25:1,7
considered to be a pristine water source.
A snow sample off the side of Mt. Shasta tested


334
0:25:1,7 --> 0:25:3,32
61,000 parts per billion.


335
0:25:3,32 --> 0:25:4,6
Enter Francis Mangels – USDA Biologist with
document of test results dating 07/09/08


336
0:25:4,6 --> 0:25:8,36
[Pointing to document of Mt Shasta snow tested]
This is just ordinary snow water and people


337
0:25:8,36 --> 0:25:12,909
are drinking this stuff when they're hiking
on the mountain. And remember, government


338
0:25:12,909 --> 0:25:20,559
action is required at 1000. This is 61 times
over the government limit and our hikers are


339
0:25:20,559 --> 0:25:29,86
drinking this poisonous water on Mt. Shasta
mountain itself. Barium 83, strontium 383.


340
0:25:29,86 --> 0:25:35,8
Mike Murphy
So this summer, the people climbing are drinking


341
0:25:35,8 --> 0:25:35,62
poison.


342
0:25:35,62 --> 0:25:38,539
Francis Mangels
Basically. I certainly wouldn't want to drink


343
0:25:38,539 --> 0:25:40,85
61,000 micrograms per liter of aluminum.


344
0:25:40,85 --> 0:25:44,59
Dane Wigington
And again, we've already seen in 5 years soil


345
0:25:44,59 --> 0:25:50,2
pHs in this area that have escalated ten to
twelve times and we can prove that conclusively.


346
0:25:50,2 --> 0:25:56,2
It is not speculation. We can prove conclusively
that these metals have been in the rain. We


347
0:25:56,2 --> 0:25:57,179
have duplicate samples.


348
0:25:57,179 --> 0:25:59,86

350
0:26:6,429 --> 0:26:13,659
with the Forest Service as a wildlife biologist
and before that several years with the USDA


351
0:26:13,659 --> 0:26:21,899
Soil Conservation Service as a soil conservationist.
Also have run the botany programs, range and


352
0:26:21,899 --> 0:26:28,809
grazing programs and I continue that. Today
I do a lot of Master Gardener consultation


353
0:26:28,809 --> 0:26:34,7
work. [walking out to garden]
When I started this garden back in about 2005


354
0:26:34,7 --> 0:26:43,57
or so the pH here was about 5.5 to 5.6. This
is the old soil survey of the county. You


355
0:26:43,57 --> 0:26:50,659
can look at the page right here, this is my
soil right here. It's at deeds 125, 126 and


356
0:26:50,659 --> 0:27:0,63
it's right here at my house and here the soil
reaction, pH should be between 4.5 and 6.0


357
0:27:0,63 --> 0:27:4,99
and over there in the pure mud it's even a
little darker. It's 6.8 right there.


358
0:27:4,99 --> 0:27:10,659
Mike Murphy
And what can this do to plant life and ecosystems?


359
0:27:10,659 --> 0:27:15,39
Francis Mangels
Well, you hollow one of these things out and


360
0:27:15,39 --> 0:27:19,419
you start looking at the little things that
are crawling around in the soil and a lot


361
0:27:19,419 --> 0:27:24,679
of times, they aren't there any more. The
little soil arthropods that you can barely


362
0:27:24,679 --> 0:27:30,789
see on a microscope, you can actually see
movement with this, little tiny tiny microscopic.


363
0:27:30,789 --> 0:27:37,809
They look like little pieces of dust. Those
start to go away. They're not entirely gone


364
0:27:37,809 --> 0:27:47,809
but they start to go away. This is black oak
acorns. This is pieces of cedar wood. You


365
0:27:47,809 --> 0:27:55,29
know, come on folks. This should be very acid
and I'm getting ten times higher than expected?


366
0:27:55,29 --> 0:27:58,419
There's something really wrong here.
[back in house now]


367
0:27:58,419 --> 0:28:1,429
You can see all those reports, lots of them.


368
0:28:1,429 --> 0:28:3,409
Mike Murphy
You have over twenty reports here.


369
0:28:3,409 --> 0:28:6,899
Francis Mangels
Well at least twenty, I'd say closer to thirty.


370
0:28:6,899 --> 0:28:12,44
Mike Murphy
All revealing dangerous amounts of aluminum


371
0:28:12,44 --> 0:28:12,77
and barium.


372
0:28:12,77 --> 0:28:15,12
Francis Mangels
Well, you know, the science is there to say


373
0:28:15,12 --> 0:28:22,13
that something funny is happening and the
naysayers say “Well, so what? Isn't neutral


374
0:28:22,13 --> 0:28:27,82
good?” Well no, neutral is not good. Neutral
is not good. If your soil is supposed to be


375
0:28:27,82 --> 0:28:33,37
5.6 then it should stay 5.6 if you want the
forest to stay healthy and if you want to


376
0:28:33,37 --> 0:28:37,73
grow a good garden, you have to keep your
pH around 6.0 to 6.5.


377
0:28:37,73 --> 0:28:44,87
Mahaia Sol – student
I think that we just need to wake up and just


378
0:28:44,87 --> 0:28:53,88
look at what's happening because we just can't
ignore it because it gets worse and worse


379
0:28:53,88 --> 0:28:55,11
if we just keep ignoring it and pushing it
away like oh, that's nothing. There was Mason


380
0:28:55,11 --> 0:29:0,919
jars and they were brand new, sterilized,
and that's what we catch the rain in and there


381
0:29:0,919 --> 0:29:1,2
was a HEPA filter that we tested the air with.


382
0:29:1,2 --> 0:29:2,88
Mike Murphy
Okay, so you caught rain and you basically


383
0:29:2,88 --> 0:29:4,649
filtered air. What did you find?


384
0:29:4,649 --> 0:29:5,83
Mahaia Sol
Aluminum, barium.


385
0:29:5,83 --> 0:29:7,89
Mike Murphy [inside residence with Francis
Mangels]


386
0:29:7,89 --> 0:29:17,69
Here's another test that's revealing 375,000
parts per billion aluminum. Barium at 3090,


387
0:29:17,69 --> 0:29:18,88
strontium at 345.


388
0:29:18,88 --> 0:29:21,45
Francis Mangels
Yeah, that's from a lined pond.


389
0:29:21,45 --> 0:29:25,72
Dane Wigington [outdoors]
With EPDM fish safe pond liner there is no


390
0:29:25,72 --> 0:29:31,13
chemicals, manufacturing materials at all
in that pond liner that's available to the


391
0:29:31,13 --> 0:29:36,2
aquatic life. It's designed for that purpose.
The well that feeds this pond has been tested


392
0:29:36,2 --> 0:29:42,87
and retested and indeed no detectable aluminum,
zero. The only other place this pond can receive


393
0:29:42,87 --> 0:29:48,49
water is rainfall and we're located on a filtered
forested hilltop miles and miles and miles


394
0:29:48,49 --> 0:29:53,86
away from any industry, highway, and so forth.
After several heavy spray days there was a


395
0:29:53,86 --> 0:29:58,74
film that we would see form on the surface
of the water so we tested that crust and it


396
0:29:58,74 --> 0:30:6,519
was aluminum and barium. But after a year
and a half's accumulation we had 375,000 parts


397
0:30:6,519 --> 0:30:13,9
per billion of aluminum in it. It's literally
toxic. We can say conclusively that what we


398
0:30:13,9 --> 0:30:19,46
see in the sky matches expressly what's outlined
in the numerous patents and the materials


399
0:30:19,46 --> 0:30:24,279
in the ground match those patents and this
material was not there five years ago. It's


400
0:30:24,279 --> 0:30:30,9
a recent phenomenon in the quantities it's
in. It has escalated in some cases 50,000


401
0:30:30,9 --> 0:30:35,48
percent in five years in the case of aluminum
from original baseline reading of 7 parts


402
0:30:35,48 --> 0:30:39,96
per billion which was already high, it has
escalated up to 50,000 percent in five years.


403
0:30:39,96 --> 0:30:42,46
We have seen profound changes in that time.


404
0:30:42,46 --> 0:30:46,549
Francis Mangels
Dr. Leonard Thyme, PhD in Chemistry, I cross-checked


405
0:30:46,549 --> 0:30:55,679
with him and he said the oxides of aluminum,
barium, and strontium will drive your pH from


406
0:30:55,679 --> 0:30:59,549
an acid soil like this up into the neutral.
There is no question about it.


407
0:30:59,549 --> 0:31:2,48
Mike Murphy
And that's exactly what you see happened.


408
0:31:2,48 --> 0:31:7,32
Dr. Lenny Thyme PhD
I have a Doctorate in Inorganic Chemistry


409
0:31:7,32 --> 0:31:12,779
from Oregon State University in which I was
working with different metals and oxidation


410
0:31:12,779 --> 0:31:21,919
states and then did post-doctorate work at
Brandeis where I was working stabilizing off-oxidation


411
0:31:21,919 --> 0:31:28,36
states of different metals. The goal is to
sort of figure out how everything fits in


412
0:31:28,36 --> 0:31:36,64
the dynamic equilibrium of life.. I was working
with Francis in Mt. Shasta and he showed me


413
0:31:36,64 --> 0:31:42,39
some rain water analyses that had to do with
levels of aluminum, strontium, and barium


414
0:31:42,39 --> 0:31:50,94
in the atmosphere so I feel the knee jerk
toxin in these chemtrails is the aluminum.


415
0:31:50,94 --> 0:31:56,38
From the levels we were looking at in Mt.
Shasta this is totally, totally unacceptable.


416
0:31:56,38 --> 0:32:0,0
When you get to metals and biological systems
you're


417
0:32:0,0 --> 0:32:2,48
Dr. Lenny Thyme PhD
no longer talking about the bulk aluminum


418
0:32:2,48 --> 0:32:8,549
that most people think about when they're
using, drinking from soda pop cans and that.


419
0:32:8,549 --> 0:32:13,76
So once it gets to the aluminum oxide stage
it just forms a plaque within your arteries


420
0:32:13,76 --> 0:32:23,19
and shuts down life. When you take elements
that normally aren't out in the environment


421
0:32:23,19 --> 0:32:32,149
and you start putting them in the environment,
it raises some serious red flags. Aluminum


422
0:32:32,149 --> 0:32:39,2
is a very specific nasty to biological systems.
It takes that site and it never lets go and


423
0:32:39,2 --> 0:32:45,659
it shuts down the site and that's it. And
so, as you accumulate aluminum over time,


424
0:32:45,659 --> 0:32:53,59
it causes major neurological damage because
it ends up as aluminum oxide that's essentially


425
0:32:53,59 --> 0:32:56,659
stuck in place and can't be flushed out by
normal systems.


426
0:32:56,659 --> 0:32:57,409
Tammy L. Born, DO [showing Toxicological Profile
4 book]


427
0:32:57,409 --> 0:33:3,419
At the core of everyone's condition there's
always some level of toxins and aluminum is


428
0:33:3,419 --> 0:33:11,84
known to have cancer causing effects. The
half life is decades. I think we should be


429
0:33:11,84 --> 0:33:16,149
working on taking more of these toxins out
of our environment rather than taking more


430
0:33:16,149 --> 0:33:20,1
toxins in. It's very concerning that if we
add more toxins to our environment that we'll


431
0:33:20,1 --> 0:33:26,75
be increasing the rates and risks of cancers.
Even one patient is not worth it. It is so


432
0:33:26,75 --> 0:33:34,98
sad that they would consider putting aluminum
in our environment to affect something when


433
0:33:34,98 --> 0:33:37,279
they could be causing so much more damage.


434
0:33:37,279 --> 0:33:40,639
Dane Wigington
Wherever that material is coming from it is


435
0:33:40,639 --> 0:33:46,299
there. The amount of metal falling on us cannot
be disputed. Absolutely this is not speculation.


436
0:33:46,299 --> 0:33:51,49
The amount of metal, as I have said, over
the last four years has increased to a degree


437
0:33:51,49 --> 0:33:58,82
of thousands of times and California Air Quality
Resources Board has studied the aerosols from


438
0:33:58,82 --> 0:34:5,73
China, these metals are not amongst them.
Mike, the reason I've chosen to focus so primarily


439
0:34:5,73 --> 0:34:12,669
on this issue is that I feel, all other issues
are secondary. What could be a greater priority


440
0:34:12,669 --> 0:34:16,81
than not being able to take a walk out your
door and taking a breath of air without sucking


441
0:34:16,81 --> 0:34:24,429
up heavy metals? If our land base is being
poisoned, if our waters are being toxified,


442
0:34:24,429 --> 0:34:29,21
what will we have left to work with? Whatever
we choose to focus our time and energy on,


443
0:34:29,21 --> 0:34:33,85
whatever our political beliefs, that this
is a common ground for all of us. We must


444
0:34:33,85 --> 0:34:38,53
have air that we can breathe that's not full
of toxic chemicals and metals. We must have


445
0:34:38,53 --> 0:34:45,48
water that's not completely laden with whatever
is being emitted from these aircraft and if


446
0:34:45,48 --> 0:34:53,389
people stopped to consider that the atmosphere
is as thin as a layer of paint on a basketball.


447
0:34:53,389 --> 0:34:57,67
It is an extremely thin layer that allows
life to exist on this planet. It shouldn't


448
0:34:57,67 --> 0:35:4,93
be treated as a physics lab and experimented
with until it's broken beyond repair. It is


449
0:35:4,93 --> 0:35:11,2
folly of unbelievable proportion and if people
understood that this kind of experimentation


450
0:35:11,2 --> 0:35:13,37
not only IS going on but HAS BEEN [emphasis
added commensurate with veracity of speaker


451
0:35:13,37 --> 0:35:21,32
here] going on for a very long time, going
back 50 years there has been countless climate


452
0:35:21,32 --> 0:35:25,1
weather modification programs that the vast
majority of the public is completely unaware


453
0:35:25,1 --> 0:35:29,79
of. If they think that this is simply not
true, that somehow they would have known that


454
0:35:29,79 --> 0:35:35,29
it was occurring I would ask them to look
at things like Agent Orange and things that


455
0:35:35,29 --> 0:35:40,12
governments do because they can, because there's
no one to stop them, because they have Dane


456
0:35:40,12 --> 0:35:45,43
Wigington
these huge military machines that want to


457
0:35:45,43 --> 0:35:49,82
control everything and that in fact the government's
own document, perhaps you may have seen that


458
0:35:49,82 --> 0:35:54,78
is available to many online that's called
“Owning the Weather”, an expressed goal


459
0:35:54,78 --> 0:35:56,63
of our government and not just our government.


460
0:35:56,63 --> 0:35:57,77
Webcast of Congressional proceeding speaker
unknown


461
0:35:57,77 --> 0:36:0,42
We are told by the Associated Press that the
American government has created weather-tampering


462
0:36:0,42 --> 0:36:5,62
techniques so that the New World Order will
be able to starve millions of Americans and


463
0:36:5,62 --> 0:36:6,66
to control the rest.


464
0:36:6,66 --> 0:36:8,2
Same webcast, different, also unidentified
speaker


465
0:36:8,2 --> 0:36:10,79
There is weather control techniques number
one that there are entire patents on the equipment


466
0:36:10,79 --> 0:36:11,15
and number two that Senator Claiborne tells
in a complete statement and story of his own


467
0:36:11,15 --> 0:36:26,44
that not only does it exist but that we have
utilized it as far back as the Viet Nam War.


468
0:36:26,44 --> 0:36:29,5
Mike Murphy
We're Americans, we'll do what we can.


469
0:36:29,5 --> 0:36:31,59
Francis Mangels
We'll do what we can do, you've got the scientists


470
0:36:31,59 --> 0:36:38,3
behind you. The scientists are with you. At
least this scientist is with you. I may not


471
0:36:38,3 --> 0:36:44,17
have a million dollar budget but I have enough
to show that something is dreadfully wrong.


472
0:36:44,17 --> 0:36:45,9
Inside residence
Mike Murphy


473
0:36:45,9 --> 0:36:52,8
We'll be in Arizona this Monday the 21st with
Senator Johnson up in Show Low so we will


474
0:36:52,8 --> 0:36:54,56
be in the car for a long time.


475
0:36:54,56 --> 0:37:9,87
Getting out of car at the residence of former
Arizona Senator Karen Johnson


476
0:37:9,87 --> 0:37:15,93
Karen Johnson
My name is Karen Johnson. I served in the


477
0:37:15,93 --> 0:37:23,26
Arizona State Legislature for 12 years and
in the Senate for four of those years. When


478
0:37:23,26 --> 0:37:30,48
you see a plane fly overhead and you see a
trail that leaves the end of the plane and


479
0:37:30,48 --> 0:37:35,1
it goes from one horizon all the way to the
other as the plane flies across and it begins


480
0:37:35,1 --> 0:37:41,81
to filter out and cover more and more of the
sky then it kind of ripples. It widens out


481
0:37:41,81 --> 0:37:48,36
and fills the whole sky. I mean it. How could
anybody think that that was the case? And


482
0:37:48,36 --> 0:37:54,67
then to live, to be underneath that and know
that whatever is in that is falling down upon


483
0:37:54,67 --> 0:38:2,78
you and upon your animals and upon the Earth.
It's frightening to me and if people don't


484
0:38:2,78 --> 0:38:8,27
start really waking up and facing the fact
that we've got people that are doing terrible


485
0:38:8,27 --> 0:38:13,99
things to us and we had better wake up and
fight back now. I mean, I'm the mom of eleven


486
0:38:13,99 --> 0:38:18,96
kids. I've got thirty five grandkids. I mean
I've got a stake in this. I care about what


487
0:38:18,96 --> 0:38:24,9
is going to be left for my grandchildren.
I care about it and I'm extremely worried


488
0:38:24,9 --> 0:38:27,19
about what is going to be left to them.


489
0:38:27,19 --> 0:38:35,54
Dr. James Rota DDS [in his office]
Aluminum is toxic and we know that it's accumulative.


490
0:38:35,54 --> 0:38:39,4
We know we're getting more. We're absorbing
it in our air, we're drinking it in our water


491
0:38:39,4 --> 0:38:46,32
so we are accumulating more. So the thought
of more aluminum being disbursed in our environment


492
0:38:46,32 --> 0:38:51,14
in the way that you mention is very frightening
to us, very disturbing to us and those of


493
0:38:51,14 --> 0:38:56,21
us who have done any research on this are
really quite concerned that we are ill-informed


494
0:38:56,21 --> 0:39:3,9
about this issue and mostly that it's being
done. Aluminum is toxic. We know that it is


495
0:39:3,9 --> 0:39:9,51
and we can debate about the amount of toxicity
that is going to be disturbing the body, but


496
0:39:9,51 --> 0:39:15,51
as far as really accepting the fact that it
is accumulative, it's synergistic then we


497
0:39:15,51 --> 0:39:20,51
have to conclude that it's just not a good
idea to put it in our atmosphere especially


498
0:39:20,51 --> 0:39:25,22
when we know we're getting increased amounts
and especially when we know the scientific


499
0:39:25,22 --> 0:39:31,25
communities around the world are pointing
a finger at the heavy metal toxicities, at


500
0:39:31,25 --> 0:39:36,53
the levels that we're absorbing in the day
to day food that we eat and the air that we


501
0:39:36,53 --> 0:39:36,65
breathe.


502
0:39:36,65 --> 0:39:40,97
Karen Johnson
So the concern is off the charts about why


503
0:39:40,97 --> 0:39:47,27
is this happening? Why is this being allowed
to be continually sprayed all over the United


504
0:39:47,27 --> 0:39:55,35
States, all over the world? Who is paying
for this? I mean the incidence of Alzheimer’s


505
0:39:55,35 --> 0:40:1,38
has just sky-rocketed which evidently has
to do with an accumulation of aluminum in


506
0:40:1,38 --> 0:40:8,51
the brain cells. I mean almost every family
has been touched by a member, as they get


507
0:40:8,51 --> 0:40:17,22
older, having Alzheimer’s And it's a horrible
disease and to say that this just came because


508
0:40:17,22 --> 0:40:22,91
people drank soda pop out of aluminum cans.
You know, when my father passed away with


509
0:40:22,91 --> 0:40:27,86
Alzheimer’s and he didn't ever drink soda
pop, you know, and so that explanation doesn't


510
0:40:27,86 --> 0:40:34,68
ring true with me and so I'm wondering how
much did this chemtrails spraying, back in


511
0:40:34,68 --> 0:40:37,2
the Illinois area affect him?


512
0:40:37,2 --> 0:40:44,63
[back at home with Karen Johnson and her husband]
Mr. Johnson


513
0:40:44,63 --> 0:40:51,17
A firefighter up in Pine, Arizona says the
wildfires now that they're fighting are way


514
0:40:51,17 --> 0:40:57,29
beyond anything that they've4 seen before
in intensity. And when you look at the air


515
0:40:57,29 --> 0:41:1,6
samples and you see the fine particles of
aluminum, which is very flammable, and you


516
0:41:1,6 --> 0:41:10,75
see magnesium that is settling on the trees,
this is causing unprecedented savage wildfires.


517
0:41:10,75 --> 0:41:14,83
Karen Johnson
But if you look at this you can see that these


518
0:41:14,83 --> 0:41:20,28
are parts per billion. They just sent this
to me and I found it to be extremely interesting


519
0:41:20,28 --> 0:41:27,64
because we should have two parts per billion
of aluminum in our air and this is saying


520
0:41:27,64 --> 0:41:32,58
that there's 39,000 parts per billion. [reference
to pictured document titled “Phoenix - Air


521
0:41:32,58 --> 0:41:37,13
Particulates – 7/21/2009] of aluminum. That's
astronomical. Barium is high. I mean, these


522
0:41:37,13 --> 0:41:43,56
are way off the charts of what people should
be breathing, of what's coming down on them.


523
0:41:43,56 --> 0:41:49,56
And you know, people wonder why their health
is deteriorating, why they have to go to emergency


524
0:41:49,56 --> 0:41:55,63
rooms, why they can't breathe, why they're
getting Alzheimer’s This has been planned!


525
0:41:55,63 --> 0:42:0,56
We have a leech. I don't know what you want
to call them, one-worlders, Illuminati, I


526
0:42:0,56 --> 0:42:5,2
don't know what you want to call them. But
in with these people that don't care about


527
0:42:5,2 --> 0:42:12,3
the average person. They only care about themselves,
their greed, their power, and if they eliminate,


528
0:42:12,3 --> 0:42:17,18
you know, two-thirds or three-fourths of us
from the planet, so much the better for them.


529
0:42:17,18 --> 0:42:23,13
Then they don't have as much people to herd
around and worry about. So this is a lot what


530
0:42:23,13 --> 0:42:29,76
this is about and it's very very alarming
and scary. I mean, where is this stuff coming


531
0:42:29,76 --> 0:42:34,82
from, and why? I mean why is some of this
stuff [looking at toxicity reports] being


532
0:42:34,82 --> 0:42:42,66
put out there? You know, I've heard different
explanations about “Oh we need to cool the


533
0:42:42,66 --> 0:42:47,96
planet”, all this and that, but if people
are up there trying to coll the planet, why


534
0:42:47,96 --> 0:42:56,1
do we need all this kind of stuff in it? The
explanations just never have really rang very


535
0:42:56,1 --> 0:42:56,22
true.


536
0:42:56,22 --> 0:42:58,39
Deborah Whitman
And as I'm setting up equipment, she looked


537
0:42:58,39 --> 0:43:6,2
at me and said “Oh, these trees here are
dying.” So I thought,m well then, I'm going


538
0:43:6,2 --> 0:43:10,39
to test for aluminum, because that's one of
the key things in the programs that we're


539
0:43:10,39 --> 0:43:16,3
talking about, and titanium. So I took a bark
sample and tested it and it came back positive


540
0:43:16,3 --> 0:43:21,65
for aluminum and titanium. So then I started
traveling around California and noticing the


541
0:43:21,65 --> 0:43:26,96
same thing. In Lake Tahoe there was a lot
of the same type of bark and all through the


542
0:43:26,96 --> 0:43:33,5
Sacramento area and Davis, just about everywhere
I went. I was noticing this silver white bark.


543
0:43:33,5 --> 0:43:39,46
What I think is happening is that these chemicals
are getting down and destroying the roots


544
0:43:39,46 --> 0:43:42,8
and then as they come up, they're going into
the bark.


545
0:43:42,8 --> 0:43:49,1
Karen Johnson
Now those two right there. It just hurts so


546
0:43:49,1 --> 0:43:56,7
much to see these two, look at how old they
are. We probably lost forty trees on ten acres.


547
0:43:56,7 --> 0:44:1,74
About every other weekend we'd see another
tree that was beginning to die and it's just


548
0:44:1,74 --> 0:44:7,17
so sad, we'd just cry and to think that that
may have something to do with, along with


549
0:44:7,17 --> 0:44:14,82
other explanations, would really really frost
me. Every time we lose a tree, it's not good,


550
0:44:14,82 --> 0:44:19,24
it's just sad. You know there's another one
over here in this group of trees here. Don't


551
0:44:19,24 --> 0:44:23,34
you feel better when you stand up and fight
than when you crawl down into a little hole


552
0:44:23,34 --> 0:44:30,44
and go to sleep? I mean, my gosh people! Your
families are out there. Children are out there,


553
0:44:30,44 --> 0:44:35,13
your grandchildren! I mean, you've got to
do something to help!


554
0:44:35,13 --> 0:44:48,55
Mike Murphy [on road in car]
My greatest hope is to get people to question


555
0:44:48,55 --> 0:44:52,0
and hey, if they don't wake up while we're
there, I'm hoping to plant some seeds. We're


556
0:44:52,0 --> 0:45:8,57
going to the most beautiful place on the planet,
Hawaii, to see what's going on and collect


557
0:45:8,57 --> 0:45:12,47
some data.


558
0:45:12,47 --> 0:45:30,2
[Arriving at organic farm on remote side of
Maui]


559
0:45:30,2 --> 0:45:41,72
Unknown speaker
Look at this, Man!


560
0:45:41,72 --> 0:45:55,5
Mike Murphy
Yeah, the mind can't even conceive of a dream


561
0:45:55,5 --> 0:45:58,78
like this here.


562
0:45:58,78 --> 0:46:4,51
Unknown speaker
Yeah, even coming here, one would never think


563
0:46:4,51 --> 0:46:13,7
that here in paradise that it's getting destroyed.
And they're doing it island style. They're


564
0:46:13,7 --> 0:46:17,91
doing it off the island so you don't see the
chemtrail airplane.


565
0:46:17,91 --> 0:46:21,95
Mike Murphy
The theory is that they're spraying off-shore


566
0:46:21,95 --> 0:46:23,9
and it's coming in.


567
0:46:23,9 --> 0:46:25,81
Resident
Now these are coming from the west. They're


568
0:46:25,81 --> 0:46:32,1
also spraying on both sides today. A lot of
this stuff is actually chemtrails coming in


569
0:46:32,1 --> 0:46:37,72
this direction. The material is blocking.
We should be able to see to the horizon where


570
0:46:37,72 --> 0:46:42,75
the Earth curves. We're high enough and we
have the ocean, right? So we should be able


571
0:46:42,75 --> 0:46:44,54
to see the Big Island, it's only thirty miles
away.


572
0:46:44,54 --> 0:46:47,73
Resident
And you can see it's not a blue sky behind


573
0:46:47,73 --> 0:46:55,33
it. That's the key. So it's all, you know,
it has that weird looking blue, like silver-blue,


574
0:46:55,33 --> 0:47:1,13
I call it. And this is a nice day. You know,
there's no more blue sky. We're going to look


575
0:47:1,13 --> 0:47:5,6
at the stars tonight and it's like, you'll
see it. You can count them, there's so few


576
0:47:5,6 --> 0:47:10,26
stars at night now. There should be hundreds
of thousands of stars and I can count the


577
0:47:10,26 --> 0:47:15,3
stars. There's like one here and one here
and one planet here [pointing up] and it's


578
0:47:15,3 --> 0:47:18,1
like some nights you'll see a hundred and
some nights ten.


579
0:47:18,1 --> 0:47:20,84
Resident [walking over to two trees]
Now this is what concerns me, this kind of


580
0:47:20,84 --> 0:47:24,98
stuff right here [patting bark]. It's just
soft.


581
0:47:24,98 --> 0:47:27,11
Mike Murphy
Okay.


582
0:47:27,11 --> 0:47:29,84
Resident
This just comes right off [demonstrates, bark


583
0:47:29,84 --> 0:47:36,9
shreds]. It's not natural. I've seen hundreds
of thousands of coconuts and I've never seen


584
0:47:36,9 --> 0:47:40,66
it falling apart like that. Look at this you
guys [shredding bark]. I've never seen anything


585
0:47:40,66 --> 0:47:47,76
like this. I used to trim trees all the time
on the Big Island. I've never seen anything


586
0:47:47,76 --> 0:47:49,73
like that.. That's why I'm concerned.


587
0:47:49,73 --> 0:47:52,67
Mike Murphy
It's not an easy task that you have, here


588
0:47:52,67 --> 0:47:58,37
on the island. I can see the skepticism because
it's so far beyond anybody's reality.


589
0:47:58,37 --> 0:48:2,49
Resident
It's amazing. It's amazing to not try to look


590
0:48:2,49 --> 0:48:7,65
through somebody else's eyes. Through my eyes
this is like night and day. And for other


591
0:48:7,65 --> 0:48:11,72
people the illusion is just so deep.


592
0:48:11,72 --> 0:48:15,84
Mike Murphy
What do you think would happen if everybody


593
0:48:15,84 --> 0:48:30,37
awakened to what was going on and what the
plans were with the geoengineers?


594
0:48:30,37 --> 0:48:43,63
Resident
Well, that 
we won't be able to live here and grow our


595
0:48:43,63 --> 0:48:49,4
own food, and that our health is going to
be compromised.


596
0:48:49,4 --> 0:48:52,35
Mike Murphy
Do you think it already has been?


597
0:48:52,35 --> 0:48:54,21
Resident
Yes. The thing is that they're doing it every


598
0:48:54,21 --> 0:48:59,7
day here, every day. So it's hammering and
hammering, hammering, hammering, micro-doses


599
0:48:59,7 --> 0:49:3,94
every day and of course it's getting into
the environment and of course it's weakening


600
0:49:3,94 --> 0:49:10,23
the plants and it takes a couple of years
to weaken the plants so we're asking for GMO


601
0:49:10,23 --> 0:49:16,45
taro and we're asking for GMO papaya because
we can't grow our natural seeds. We can't


602
0:49:16,45 --> 0:49:21,42
be sustainable. We can't truly be here as
God created us to be.


603
0:49:21,42 --> 0:49:26,39
Maui organic farm resident
And so my friend convinced me to do a hair


604
0:49:26,39 --> 0:49:32,42
analysis on my daughter. So I went ahead and
cut close to her scalp and got some really


605
0:49:32,42 --> 0:49:36,79
recently grown hair and sent it in. I was
just sure that my daughter's hair was going


606
0:49:36,79 --> 0:49:41,97
to be so clean with this lifestyle that we
live. And lo and behold it came back and her


607
0:49:41,97 --> 0:49:49,1
levels were really high in aluminum. This
is the chart here. This is the reference range


608
0:49:49,1 --> 0:49:58,8
and this is where my daughter is. 23.1 aluminum
and the skies are covered with a white mist.


609
0:49:58,8 --> 0:50:2,31
I look up at night and anymore I don't see
the deep dense stars that I used to and I


610
0:50:2,31 --> 0:50:9,56
can't help but think that this has something
to do with my daughter's health. I don't know


611
0:50:9,56 --> 0:50:10,88
where else the heavy metals are coming from.


612
0:50:10,88 --> 0:50:11,94
Resident
I mean, look how old she is [appears to be


613
0:50:11,94 --> 0:50:19,7
about 8] and she's been isolated here. Anybody
looking at the situation would be like this


614
0:50:19,7 --> 0:50:23,53
is paradise. This child should be like super
human, an organic farm. And here you are getting


615
0:50:23,53 --> 0:50:30,5
all this heavy metal stuff. She has the highest
level of aluminum on the chart and has never


616
0:50:30,5 --> 0:50:31,92
had a vaccine either.


617
0:50:31,92 --> 0:50:35,41
Mike Murphy
Folks, these people are playing God. They're


618
0:50:35,41 --> 0:50:39,77
playing God; they're manipulating the weather
and they are spraying stuff into the sky.


619
0:50:39,77 --> 0:50:45,38
They are trying to geoengineer everything
including your plants and trees and even your


620
0:50:45,38 --> 0:50:50,87
ocean. Well tonight we're really hoping that
instead of not looking at it, you'll really


621
0:50:50,87 --> 0:50:56,7
look into it. Because I really believe, from
the bottom of my heart that we are in a real


622
0:50:56,7 --> 0:50:58,62
crisis. I really do.


623

Earthday Maui 2010
Mike Murphy


624
0:51:2,23 --> 0:51:9,79
They are proposing dumping ten to twenty million
tons of aluminum into the upper atmosphere.


625
0:51:9,79 --> 0:51:17,41
What does aluminum do? It changes the pH of
soils which is toxic to plant life. Also,


626
0:51:17,41 --> 0:51:24,4
it's very toxic to human health. Are they
doing it? Well let me tell you what we've


627
0:51:24,4 --> 0:51:29,97
found. We have much evidence that not only
suggests, but, I believe proves that they


628
0:51:29,97 --> 0:51:34,56
are happening.
The Jeff Farias Show


629
0:51:34,56 --> 0:51:38,21
Jeff Farias
Well, as I promised we are joined now by a


630
0:51:38,21 --> 0:51:42,98
very special guest, Michael J. Murphy, who
is currently on location in Hawaii, doing


631
0:51:42,98 --> 0:51:48,21
a documentary film called “What in the World
are They Spraying?”. Michael, welcome to


632
0:51:48,21 --> 0:51:51,49
the program. It's great to speak with you
today.


633
0:51:51,49 --> 0:51:57,78
On beach with Bobby Williams and Mariel Hemingway
Bobby Williams


634
0:51:57,78 --> 0:52:4,39
I have a friend who recently, he's always
been looking at things from a different perspective.


635
0:52:4,39 --> 0:52:11,77
He's a bit of a conspiracy theorist you know,
and he says that whenever the president comes


636
0:52:11,77 --> 0:52:13,5
to L.A., there's no spraying that week.


637
0:52:13,5 --> 0:52:16,67
Mike Murphy [at picnic table on beach]
Could you have a better place for an interview?


638
0:52:16,67 --> 0:52:19,7
I mean, look.
Mariel Hemingway


639
0:52:19,7 --> 0:52:25,99
This is being done over our farms and over
our things so basically they want to eliminate


640
0:52:25,99 --> 0:52:33,2
our ability to eat organic food, clean food,
have clean water, and so in some ways it sounds


641
0:52:33,2 --> 0:52:37,31
to me like, and again, this is a projection
but it sounds to me like this is control.


642
0:52:37,31 --> 0:52:40,45
How to control the masses. How can aluminum
be good for you?


643
0:52:40,45 --> 0:52:42,87
Bobby Williams
And what was the second metal you mentioned?


644
0:52:42,87 --> 0:52:43,93
Mike Murphy
It's barium.


645
0:52:43,93 --> 0:52:46,85
Bobby Williams
Barium and aluminum. Obviously it's toxic


646
0:52:46,85 --> 0:52:47,34
to everything.


647
0:52:47,34 --> 0:52:49,12
Mike Murphy
To human health.


648
0:52:49,12 --> 0:52:52,78
Mariel Hemingway
To human health, to farms, to animals, to


649
0:52:52,78 --> 0:52:53,4
everything!


650
0:52:53,4 --> 0:52:55,91
Mike Murphy
61,000 parts per billion.


651
0:52:55,91 --> 0:52:58,43
Mariel Hemingway
And there should be a government alert at


652
0:52:58,43 --> 0:52:58,94
1,000?


653
0:52:58,94 --> 0:53:2,2
Mike Murphy
At 1,000. People are drinking this [Mt. Shasta


654
0:53:2,2 --> 0:53:5,7
pictured] that climb the mountain. They're
drinking the snow. It's poison.


655
0:53:5,7 --> 0:53:8,87
Mariel Hemingway
Oh my God, that is so disgusting!


656
0:53:8,87 --> 0:53:11,87
Bobby Williams
That's 60,000 times above regulation.


657
0:53:11,87 --> 0:53:15,41
Mike Murphy
Exactly. 60,000 times above regulation. And


658
0:53:15,41 --> 0:53:19,69
I've talked to friends in L.A. And was told,
“well, that's just condensation.” Well


659
0:53:19,69 --> 0:53:23,91
you can talk to a second-grader ice doesn't
float in the sky and spread out that way,


660
0:53:23,91 --> 0:53:24,35
you know.
Mariel Hemingway


661
0:53:24,35 --> 0:53:29,0
You're not an expert, but you're a concerned
citizen who said, “Wait a minute.” You're


662
0:53:29,0 --> 0:53:32,81
doing the research and that's what we need
to do as Americans and say “you know what?


663
0:53:32,81 --> 0:53:36,28
I want to know what's going on. I want to
know what the FDA is doing to my food. I want


664
0:53:36,28 --> 0:53:41,42
to know what the government's doing with my
air and my water and the soil.” And it's


665
0:53:41,42 --> 0:53:46,81
just great what you're doing and my kudos
to you for bringing to light this subject.


666
0:53:46,81 --> 0:53:49,42
Mike Murphy
Put all of the theories aside and just what


667
0:53:49,42 --> 0:53:56,53
geoengineers are proposing and what's being
found is scary enough so we can just address


668
0:53:56,53 --> 0:53:57,9
that.


669
0:53:57,9 --> 0:54:0,88
Mariel Hemingway
You know I encourage more people to just step


670
0:54:0,88 --> 0:54:5,43
up and ask questions and do what he's doing.
So thank you, Michael, very much.


671
0:54:5,43 --> 0:54:9,17
Mike Murphy
Aerosol spraying of aluminum affects everywhere


672
0:54:9,17 --> 0:54:15,86
and we have a beautiful tropical climate which
I believe might be in jeopardy so we wanted


673
0:54:15,86 --> 0:54:20,71
to not only comment and bring the message
of what people were finding around the world,


674
0:54:20,71 --> 0:54:26,58
but encourage people to test for the aluminum,
strontium, barium. Essentially I thought it


675
0:54:26,58 --> 0:54:31,19
was a very successful trip. I saw a lot of
people here in Hawaii, in Maui, awake and


676
0:54:31,19 --> 0:54:34,76
not only curious, but willing to look into
this deeper and that's my only hope.


677
0:54:34,76 --> 0:54:35,98
Jack Blood Radio Show Interview
Jack Blood


678
0:54:35,98 --> 0:54:42,48
This is one of the boldest moves I think,
from Ed Griffin yet. This is the taboo topic


679
0:54:42,48 --> 0:54:47,69
that nobody's supposed to talk about and that
is aerosol spraying. Now we've gotten tons


680
0:54:47,69 --> 0:54:55,56
of documented proof of errant aerosol spraying.
It just blows my mind that the whole essence


681
0:54:55,56 --> 0:55:1,37
of humanity has always been to look up into
the sky and ask “why?” No, there are no


682
0:55:1,37 --> 0:55:7,9
limitations. There is endless space and endless
universe and now, in the 21st Century we're


683
0:55:7,9 --> 0:55:13,8
not allowed to do that. Anyone who looks up
and sees the giant grids and the Xs in the


684
0:55:13,8 --> 0:55:19,1
sky that weren't part of our existence until
just a decade or two ago is just suddenly


685
0:55:19,1 --> 0:55:24,28
now called a kook, and the people that are
the best ad biggest proponents for the revolution


686
0:55:24,28 --> 0:55:27,96
of liberty, they don't want you to talk about
it because you could discredit them.


687
0:55:27,96 --> 0:55:30,99
G. Edward Griffin
It seems to be an industry that's built up


688
0:55:30,99 --> 0:55:38,52
to milk the taxpayers by undergoing some kind
of giant spraying, global spraying program


689
0:55:38,52 --> 0:55:43,46
to make all kinds of money on the project
and they don't seem to care really what effect


690
0:55:43,46 --> 0:55:48,28
it has. They're not trying to experiment to
see if humans can survive it or anything like


691
0:55:48,28 --> 0:55:53,15
that. They just want to get this stuff up.
THEN we discover, as we're going further down


692
0:55:53,15 --> 0:55:58,89
the link that there are companies generating
genetically modified organisms, the seeds,


693
0:55:58,89 --> 0:56:8,25
modified seed crops that are being engineered
to resist the aluminum in the soil. A lot


694
0:56:8,25 --> 0:56:13,16
of crops won't grow in that and so now, after
they've messed up the soil, the farmers are


695
0:56:13,16 --> 0:56:18,98
going to have to go back and buy seeds that
have been genetically engineered to resist


696
0:56:18,98 --> 0:56:24,33
the aluminum that has been put into the soil
and all of a sudden mankind is completely


697
0:56:24,33 --> 0:56:30,48
dependent on these companies like Monsanto
and these giant agricultural firms. You can't


698
0:56:30,48 --> 0:56:36,69
even grow natural seeds any more. We're looking
at that, and it's a shocking thing. I hope


699
0:56:36,69 --> 0:56:40,93
we don't find that it's true, but all the
arrows right now are pointing in that direction.


700
0:56:40,93 --> 0:56:44,9
Jack Blood
We get into a cost/benefit analysis here because


701
0:56:44,9 --> 0:56:48,69
also HAARP could be involved in this, geoengineering,
as you guys mentioned, which is documented


702
0:56:48,69 --> 0:56:53,76
heavily in Dennis Kucinich's bill that is
the Space Preservation Act, which, by the


703
0:56:53,76 --> 0:56:58,12
way, I don't thing got through congress. And
then Kay Bailout as we call her here, Kay


704
0:56:58,12 --> 0:57:4,63
Bailey Hutchinson also put together some legislation
in order to qualify geoengineering, which


705
0:57:4,63 --> 0:57:9,41
is supposed to save us all from global warming.
But it is cost/benefit analysis because it


706
0:57:9,41 --> 0:57:12,23
can benefit on so many different levels, Ed.
I mean that's how they do everything, isn't


707
0:57:12,23 --> 0:57:12,26
it?


708
0:57:12,26 --> 0:57:13,2
G. Edward Griffin
That's right. And there's an old adage that


709
0:57:13,2 --> 0:57:20,27
if you just follow the dollar, follow the
buck, you usually get to the source of the


710
0:57:20,27 --> 0:57:27,53
problem and it looks to me like there's a
tremendously profitable industry being built


711
0:57:27,53 --> 0:57:34,26
up right now around this concept of geoengineering,
or weather modification or reducing global


712
0:57:34,26 --> 0:57:39,61
warming, and all of these other things that
can be sold fairly easily to an unsuspecting


713
0:57:39,61 --> 0:57:44,2
public “Oh, that's good, we don't want global
warming,” you know and so they put up with


714
0:57:44,2 --> 0:57:49,65
this and they don't question and criticize.
But behind the scenes, you see a whole industry


715
0:57:49,65 --> 0:57:55,27
being built up, which is, as I say, tremendously
profitable and the money for all of that is


716
0:57:55,27 --> 0:58:2,4
coming from the taxpayers. And it's a scam
is basically what it is. We're just focusing


717
0:58:2,4 --> 0:58:8,35
on the one area that is really easy to prove.
There's no speculation in the area that we're


718
0:58:8,35 --> 0:58:15,27
going into. They definitely are doing this
geoengineering. They definitely are talking


719
0:58:15,27 --> 0:58:20,46
about it. They're working up formulas for
it. They've got strategies for it. They've


720
0:58:20,46 --> 0:58:24,76
got funding for it. It's already in place.
We don't even have to go into those other


721
0:58:24,76 --> 0:58:31,96
areas to make the case. Okay, let them believe
that but at least let them understand that


722
0:58:31,96 --> 0:58:37,75
they're talking about it and planning to do
it and so shouldn't they be equally alarmed


723
0:58:37,75 --> 0:58:42,67
about what they're going to do if it can be
shown that barium and aluminum and some of


724
0:58:42,67 --> 0:58:47,38
these other toxic metals are very destructive
to the planet and destructive to human health?


725
0:58:47,38 --> 0:58:53,56
Isn't that enough? I mean, how many issues
do we need to crank into this? And so if you're


726
0:58:53,56 --> 0:58:58,31
going to kill the planet, and kill the population
do we need any other reason to be alarmed?


727
0:58:58,31 --> 0:59:1,84
Jack Blood
“What in the World Are They Spraying?”


728
0:59:1,84 --> 0:59:5,95
Thank God people are asking this question.
That's all we want. We want to be able to


729
0:59:5,95 --> 0:59:11,36
ask these questions. Our good friend G. Edward
Griffin. All these here, Michael J. Murphy


730
0:59:11,36 --> 0:59:15,93
and Paul Wittenberg are doing this great effort.
With your help this is a community effort


731
0:59:15,93 --> 0:59:19,48
to get people real information. “What in
the World Are They Spraying?” Any final


732
0:59:19,48 --> 0:59:20,88
quick comments before we're out of time?


733
0:59:20,88 --> 0:59:23,25
G. Edward Griffin
Then my only final thought is that we ask


734
0:59:23,25 --> 0:59:28,77
the question “What in the world are they
spraying?” And we now know what it is and


735
0:59:28,77 --> 0:59:35,84
folks, you're not going to like it.


736
0:59:35,84 --> 0:59:45,7
Arriving in Belgium to interview in his residence
Peter Vereeke, former mayor of Evergem, Belgium.


737
0:59:45,7 --> 0:59:48,75
Peter Vereeke
I'm Peter Vereeke, I'm 54 years old, I can't


738
0:59:48,75 --> 0:59:51,43
believe it myself. I'm a very happy person.


739
0:59:51,43 --> 0:59:51,65
In car now, Peter Vereeke driving
Peter Vereeke


740
0:59:51,65 --> 1:0:12,67
We are doing the job of the police, the Justice
Department, or the Environmental Department


741
1:0:12,67 --> 1:0:14,8
should have been doing. And it's really essential
that it's going to be a grass-roots revolution.


742
1:0:14,8 --> 1:0:14,73
Mike Murphy
I think so.


743
1:0:14,73 --> 1:0:16,2
Peter Vereeke
Because we are not fighting against but for.


744
1:0:16,2 --> 1:0:22,3
I was in the council for about 25 years and
also a period as the mayor. So from that moment


745
1:0:22,3 --> 1:0:27,97
on 10 years ago everything started to change.
I started to get a picture of what is really


746
1:0:27,97 --> 1:0:38,14
going on and it became crystal clear to me
that we humankind, have been manipulated and


747
1:0:38,14 --> 1:0:47,51
dominated and exploited for centuries and
this chemtrail phenomenon made me angry because


748
1:0:47,51 --> 1:0:56,73
I was so helpless. You can decide what food
you're going to eat, what you're going to


749
1:0:56,73 --> 1:1:0,58
smoke, what you're going to drink, what kind
of life you're going to lead but not with


750
1:1:0,58 --> 1:1:7,34
this phenomenon. You are just a victim. It's
only a game. And there have to be good guys


751
1:1:7,34 --> 1:1:14,51
and there have to be bad guys. And fortunately
we are in a position to be able to play the


752
1:1:14,51 --> 1:1:19,74
role of a good guy who has the chance, and
the opportunity to overcome.


753
1:1:19,74 --> 1:1:22,92
Mike Murphy
The three days that we shared with them my


754
1:1:22,92 --> 1:1:31,4
heart just dropped because it was such a beautiful
way to live and such a peaceful way to live.


755
1:1:31,4 --> 1:1:36,31
I left wondering what's this place going to
be like in ten years? Is everything going


756
1:1:36,31 --> 1:1:42,29
to be killed off on the property? And if it
is, how are they going to get their food source?


757
1:1:42,29 --> 1:1:48,39
Are they going to have to take a class and
get certified by company XYZ? And what are


758
1:1:48,39 --> 1:1:53,1
the requirements for that? And that is the
end for freedom. I really am concerned about


759
1:1:53,1 --> 1:1:55,87
that. I definitely . . . I really am.


760
1:1:55,87 --> 1:1:59,93
Peter Vereeke
I've learned to say everything is now how


761
1:1:59,93 --> 1:2:2,64
it has to be now and everything is going to
be okay.


762
1:2:2,64 --> 1:2:3,74
Mike Murphy
It's going to be alright.


763
1:2:3,74 --> 1:2:4,99
Peter Vereeke
It's going to be okay.


764
1:2:4,99 --> 1:2:5,53
Mike Murphy
Yes.


765
1:2:5,53 --> 1:2:9,94
Peter Vereeke
I have this deep feeling that in the end we


766
1:2:9,94 --> 1:2:19,21
will prevail because we have the right on
our side. The cosmos is helping us and I have


767
1:2:19,21 --> 1:2:29,27
this strong feeling that we are being supported
by entities and by forces that we can't even


768
1:2:29,27 --> 1:2:45,75
imagine. Here for the first time we have this
scientific proof that we are being sprayed.


769
1:2:45,75 --> 1:2:51,56
We are being sprayed, and it's incredible,
it's hard to believe but we are being sprayed


770
1:2:51,56 --> 1:2:59,47
and I think that at this moment to stop is
not an option. Once you know it and once you


771
1:2:59,47 --> 1:3:8,11
have a tool like this and an opportunity like
this that the issue of chemtrails or persistent


772
1:3:8,11 --> 1:3:16,82
jet contrails or whatever name you use for
it, that this phenomenon is recognized as


773
1:3:16,82 --> 1:3:26,86
being real, publicly debated on and the context
of geoengineering. I think it's high noon


774
1:3:26,86 --> 1:3:28,37
to bring this subject to the public.


775
1:3:28,37 --> 1:3:32,24
Desiree Rover, Medical Research Journalist
This is what the sky is supposed to look like,


776
1:3:32,24 --> 1:3:39,36
these are old paintings, we've forgotten this
I'm afraid. In the years that I have been


777
1:3:39,36 --> 1:3:46,81
a medical research journalist, I have looked
at many many things and I've found the same


778
1:3:46,81 --> 1:3:56,3
three issues in whatever I'm looking at. And
that is that we are being dumbed down, we


779
1:3:56,3 --> 1:4:2,11
are being made sicker, and we are being made
infertile.


780
1:4:2,11 --> 1:4:5,9
Mike Murphy
Citizens gathered from all around the world


781
1:4:5,9 --> 1:4:10,13
in Belgium for this first ever international
chemtrails symposium. The event attracted


782
1:4:10,13 --> 1:4:14,6
the leading professionals, politicians, and
activists to discuss the health, environmental,


783
1:4:14,6 --> 1:4:16,79
and social implications of these programs.


784
1:4:16,79 --> 1:4:18,73
At the Belfort Group International Symposium
Host


785
1:4:18,73 --> 1:4:22,95
Today is only going to be about facts, documents,
figures, patents, licenses, and everything


786
1:4:22,95 --> 1:4:26,79
that brings us to the truth.


787
1:4:26,79 --> 1:4:30,97
Chris and Ansgard Priem
We have no other weapon against this vast


788
1:4:30,97 --> 1:4:38,1
complex than exposing and bringing the dark
works in the light of the truth. We have to


789
1:4:38,1 --> 1:4:46,43
hope that by our efforts more and more people
will become aware of the fact that we are


790
1:4:46,43 --> 1:4:54,76
deceived by our leaders. So today we, as a
family, join forces with the people who come


791
1:4:54,76 --> 1:4:59,96
to make it known to the world that chemtrails
are not a conspiracy theory but a conspiracy


792
1:4:59,96 --> 1:5:0,8
fact.


793
1:5:0,8 --> 1:5:2,0
Eric Cornand
From the Techniche University at Delft in


794
1:5:2,0 --> 1:5:8,35
the Netherlands, ladies and gentlemen, please
welcome Coen Vermeeren.


795
1:5:8,35 --> 1:5:16,18
Coen Vermeeren
I'm Coen Vermeeren, I'm a university professor


796
1:5:16,18 --> 1:5:20,52
of Delft University of Technology. Usually
people are with their heads to the ground


797
1:5:20,52 --> 1:5:24,94
in their own two dimensional space and they
don't look up. If you do you see more and


798
1:5:24,94 --> 1:5:30,9
more space like this. And it worried me too.
I have no explanations for our students about


799
1:5:30,9 --> 1:5:35,3
this phenomenon. I studied it myself and I
found that I couldn't get them the answers


800
1:5:35,3 --> 1:5:40,23
that they wanted but that the phenomenon is
not natural. It's not natural what is happening,


801
1:5:40,23 --> 1:5:48,68
and the explanations that are given to us
are not enough for me. If you look at it from


802
1:5:48,68 --> 1:5:52,21
a scientific point of view the first thing
a scientist does is trying to explain something.


803
1:5:52,21 --> 1:5:58,75
He goes “I'm smart and my students are not
as smart yet so I have to give them the answers


804
1:5:58,75 --> 1:6:3,9
to questions. But if you ask most scientists,
honestly, they can't answer all your questions.


805
1:6:3,9 --> 1:6:9,36
If people are using climate control over our
heads I want to know about it. The consequences


806
1:6:9,36 --> 1:6:14,8
I want to know. The health impacts, I want
to know everything. I need, as a teacher at


807
1:6:14,8 --> 1:6:20,33
my university, to give answers to my students.
And they have good questions, and I don't


808
1:6:20,33 --> 1:6:21,7
have the answers and I want to know.


809
1:6:21,7 --> 1:6:22,2
Mike Murphy
Excellent.


810
1:6:22,2 --> 1:6:23,77
Coen Vermeeren
And we should discuss this.


811
1:6:23,77 --> 1:6:27,38
Host
Ladies and gentlemen for all of you in the


812
1:6:27,38 --> 1:6:43,75
auditorium and for those in the world, Michael
Murphy.


813
1:6:43,75 --> 1:6:54,67
Mike Murphy
Well thank you very much. It's definitely


814
1:6:54,67 --> 1:6:59,46
an honor to be here in Belgium. The people
who are in power control everything. They


815
1:6:59,46 --> 1:7:4,58
control the markets, they control us, now
they're even controlling the weather, and


816
1:7:4,58 --> 1:7:9,39
they can use that for warfare applications.
The one thing they cannot control is what


817
1:7:9,39 --> 1:7:15,37
God had originally made and that's natural
organic seeds. This is called the Hegelian


818
1:7:15,37 --> 1:7:23,76
Dialect. It's problem, reaction, solution.
The problem here is massive amounts of aluminum,


819
1:7:23,76 --> 1:7:29,19
things starting to die. The solution is company
X that says “Hey man! You're not getting


820
1:7:29,19 --> 1:7:35,6
yields on your crop. Everything's dying. But
I've got the solution. I've got a seed that


821
1:7:35,6 --> 1:7:40,65
will grow in this environment. The only problem
is now you have to start buying from me.”


822
1:7:40,65 --> 1:7:44,54
We're a little concerned that maybe part of
this agenda could be to kill off anything


823
1:7:44,54 --> 1:7:51,74
that's natural and organic and to re-engineer
it with aluminum resistant GMO seeds. Many


824
1:7:51,74 --> 1:7:58,63
may know we just got back from a week of filming
in Hawaii and it was an incredible trip. A


825
1:7:58,63 --> 1:8:5,26
bit concern for the people there is they're
beginning to see softening of the coconut


826
1:8:5,26 --> 1:8:11,98
trees but their concern that these programs
may again be part of a broader agenda to destroy


827
1:8:11,98 --> 1:8:17,2
anything that's natural and organic so that
the corporate redesigned GMO foods might be


828
1:8:17,2 --> 1:8:21,109
the only thing, the only source of food for
people.


829
1:8:21,109 --> 1:8:25,21
Unknown speaker
I didn't anticipate so many people, young


830
1:8:25,21 --> 1:8:31,4
and old, who are interested in this phenomenon
are concerned about it, and I especially liked


831
1:8:31,4 --> 1:8:36,27
the address that the young girl gave today.
Only 17 and already giving an address to the


832
1:8:36,27 --> 1:8:36,489
audience is, wow, incredible.


833
1:8:36,489 --> 1:8:37,25
Sofia Xenedis [at symposium]
My name is Sofia Xenedis, I am 17 years old.


834
1:8:37,25 --> 1:8:52,179
It is quite scary to know that the air we
breathe is not what it is supposed to be,


835
1:8:52,179 --> 1:8:59,23
that the food we eat and the water we drink
may contain traces of those substances which


836
1:8:59,23 --> 1:9:1,62
are sprayed out over all of us as though we
are being poisoned like insects. The feeling


837
1:9:1,62 --> 1:9:2,88
that this is causing me are feelings of deep
anger and rage. I don't want to be infected


838
1:9:2,88 --> 1:9:8,0
with cancer and I'm just so angry that this
global poisoning can be going on on such a


839
1:9:8,0 --> 1:9:12,6
massive scale and not enough is being done
to stop this crime.


840
1:9:12,6 --> 1:9:18,21
Host
Let me ask you one question. Are we being


841
1:9:18,21 --> 1:9:27,69
sprayed? Have we been sprayed? And it is their
intention to spray again and again? What are


842
1:9:27,69 --> 1:9:44,85
we going to do about it? How are we going
to deal with it? How are we going to stop


843
1:9:44,85 --> 1:10:1,65
it? I know the answer. There is only one person
who can stop it and you know him. You are.


844
1:10:1,65 --> 1:10:6,43
You are. You are the person you have been
waiting for. We are magnificent, beautiful,


845
1:10:6,43 --> 1:10:15,62
god-like divine human beings. Ladies and gentlemen,
sisters and brothers in this auditorium and


846
1:10:15,62 --> 1:10:22,21
ion the whole world, thank you so very much
for being present with us and for now please


847
1:10:22,21 --> 1:10:28,13
enjoy this anthem.


848
1:10:28,13 --> 1:10:52,31
Arriving at G. Edward Griffin's house
G. Edward Griffin


849
1:10:52,31 --> 1:10:57,29
So uh, I'm glad that the weather's been good
for you fellows, so far. Just think if we


850
1:10:57,29 --> 1:11:1,87
were doing this in the wintertime. If you're
going to Washington DC you might run into


851
1:11:1,87 --> 1:11:2,48
snow.


852
1:11:2,48 --> 1:11:7,4
Mike Murphy
Thank God or not. You know, it's interesting


853
1:11:7,4 --> 1:11:16,38
that of the different weather modification
programs there's something like 32 in the


854
1:11:16,38 --> 1:11:23,6
continental US alone going on so the theory
is that geoengineering is, in part, weather


855
1:11:23,6 --> 1:11:23,89
modification.


856
1:11:23,89 --> 1:11:26,59
G. Edward Griffin
You know, Mike, that's a very good point.


857
1:11:26,59 --> 1:11:33,43
There are so many subsets connected with this
issue of geoengineering. People are writing


858
1:11:33,43 --> 1:11:38,15
to us all the time with information about
the connection to global warming, the connection


859
1:11:38,15 --> 1:11:44,5
to weather modification. Some people think
there's a connection with Morgellon's disease


860
1:11:44,5 --> 1:11:53,43
and some people think it's a means of transmitting
electrical impulses from the HAARP antenna


861
1:11:53,43 --> 1:11:59,51
system up in Alaska and Siberia. It gets your
head spinning and each area, I think, is worthy


862
1:11:59,51 --> 1:12:5,8
of investigation, but we have so little time,
it's wise for us to stay focused on just the


863
1:12:5,8 --> 1:12:11,32
air spraying and the toxic effect of these
chemicals and the destruction of the planet


864
1:12:11,32 --> 1:12:15,81
and the damage to human health. What more
do you need than that to convince people we


865
1:12:15,81 --> 1:12:21,65
have to put a stop to it? To stay focused,
I think, is our mission on this one.


866
1:12:21,65 --> 1:12:28,33
Mike Murphy Narrating
We had an idea.


867
1:12:28,33 --> 1:12:31,49
Mike Murphy
We know that you know the political system


868
1:12:31,49 --> 1:12:37,53
real well and our idea was this: We have a
ton of data and information that we've collected


869
1:12:37,53 --> 1:12:43,4
throughout our travels and we really think
a good way to end the film would be addressing


870
1:12:43,4 --> 1:12:48,43
this to elected officials, some of the senators.
So we were thinking this: If you might be


871
1:12:48,43 --> 1:12:53,72
able to come and help us out and perhaps show
us the way in, how to get this done politically.


872
1:12:53,72 --> 1:12:57,2
Jeremy Rothe-Kushel
It sounds like a really good idea and I'll


873
1:12:57,2 --> 1:13:8,23
also see who to get to in terms of researching
who we should really be talking to about this.


874
1:13:8,23 --> 1:13:14,21
At the very least if we can make it impossible
for them to claim that they don't know anything


875
1:13:14,21 --> 1:13:14,37
about this, strip away their plausible deniability
that they haven't heard of the data that points


876
1:13:14,37 --> 1:13:29,83
to a geoengineering stratospheric aerosol
operation already going on. And at the very


877
1:13:29,83 --> 1:13:30,3
least it should be very interesting to the
District of Criminality, put some people on


878
1:13:30,3 --> 1:13:30,5
alert.


879
1:13:30,5 --> 1:13:31,82
G. Edward Griffin
Yeah, you have a lot of enemies in Washington.


880
1:13:31,82 --> 1:13:36,76
That's where all the power comes together
and the money, you know. So there are people


881
1:13:36,76 --> 1:13:44,2
there I'm sure, that just don't want us to
do this job, but I'm glad you're going and


882
1:13:44,2 --> 1:13:45,51
you'll find out.


883
1:13:45,51 --> 1:13:52,6
Mike Murphy Narrating
We took the data to Washington DC. There we


884
1:13:52,6 --> 1:13:58,34
presented our elected officials with the following
letter: According to the Fifth Article of


885
1:13:58,34 --> 1:14:3,99
the Bill of Rights amending the Constitution
of the United States of America, no person


886
1:14:3,99 --> 1:14:10,9
shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property
without due process of law. But the daily


887
1:14:10,9 --> 1:14:17,54
spraying is depriving all persons within the
United States of life, health, liberty and


888
1:14:17,54 --> 1:14:23,74
integrity of our common and private property
without due process of law. As a representative


889
1:14:23,74 --> 1:14:29,2
of the people of the United States of America,
we insist that you do everything in your power


890
1:14:29,2 --> 1:14:35,26
to protect us and immediately put a stop to
geoengineering spraying at once. There exists


891
1:14:35,26 --> 1:14:41,1
no justification, legal or otherwise, to poison
the planet and its inhabitants.


892
1:14:41,1 --> 1:14:46,4
David Keith – Geoengineer
Now supposing that space aliens arrived, maybe


893
1:14:46,4 --> 1:14:50,2
they're going to land at the UN headquarters
down the road here or maybe they'll pick a


894
1:14:50,2 --> 1:14:57,14
smarter spot. But suppose they arrive and
they give you a box and the box has two knobs.


895
1:14:57,14 --> 1:15:2,79
One knob is for controlling global temperature.
Maybe another knob is for controlling CO2


896
1:15:2,79 --> 1:15:6,36
concentrations. You might imagine that we
would fight wars over that box because we


897
1:15:6,36 --> 1:15:11,75
have no way to agree on where to set the knobs,
no global governance, and different people


898
1:15:11,75 --> 1:15:13,3
have different places they want it set.


899
1:15:13,3 --> 1:15:17,18
Male speaker on a webcast
Solar engineering is like chemotherapy. No


900
1:15:17,18 --> 1:15:24,2
one wants it, but we all want the ability
to do chemo and to understand its risks, should


901
1:15:24,2 --> 1:15:25,45
we find ourselves with dangerous cancer.


902
1:15:25,45 --> 1:15:27,59
Unknown questioner
How long does it last up there?


903
1:15:27,59 --> 1:15:29,47
Original panel speaker
The lifetimes or years?


904
1:15:29,47 --> 1:15:30,38
Questioner
In years.


905
1:15:30,38 --> 1:15:33,2
Original panel speaker
It lasts for a couple of years.


906
1:15:33,2 --> 1:15:33,53
Questioner
And then what, precipitates out?


907
1:15:33,53 --> 1:15:34,5
Original panel speaker
Yeah, that's correct.


908
1:15:34,5 --> 1:15:36,44
Questioner
And no toxic side effects that you know of?


909
1:15:36,44 --> 1:15:38,68
Original panel speaker
The thing we always wonder about is the unknown


910
1:15:38,68 --> 1:15:42,75
in that. So if you're thinking about saving
acidification, it's clear that's not a problem


911
1:15:42,75 --> 1:15:46,97
in several studies that showed that. Of course,
the concern here is that with so little research,


912
1:15:46,97 --> 1:15:50,17
there may be some unknown unknown that comes
out of left field that bites us.


913
1:15:50,17 --> 1:15:52,55
Mike Murphy [approaching Paul E. Kanjorski,
Democrat in Congress Pennsylvania]


914
1:15:52,55 --> 1:15:56,61
My name's Mike Murphy, I'm a film-maker in
from Los Angeles, we're covering an issue


915
1:15:56,61 --> 1:15:57,11
called geoengineering.


916
1:15:57,11 --> 1:15:59,37
Mike Murphy [talking with Dianne Feinstein,
Democratic Senator California]


917
1:15:59,37 --> 1:16:2,2
We have a very quick question about the issue
of geoengineering.


918
1:16:2,2 --> 1:16:5,19
Dianne Feinstein
I'm afraid I don't know what you're talking


919
1:16:5,19 --> 1:16:5,39
about.


920
1:16:5,39 --> 1:16:9,29
Mike Murphy [after cut back to Paul E. Kanjorski]
We're wondering if you're supportive of geoengineers'


921
1:16:9,29 --> 1:16:13,17
proposals of spraying 10 to 20 million tons
of aluminum into the atmosphere?


922
1:16:13,17 --> 1:16:16,84
Paul E. Kanjorski
I should really get a briefing paper on it


923
1:16:16,84 --> 1:16:17,79
before I issue an opinion.


924
1:16:17,79 --> 1:16:19,55
Mike Murphy
Not a problem. Are you aware of the issue?


925
1:16:19,55 --> 1:16:20,82
Paul E. Kanjorski
Not completely.


926
1:16:20,82 --> 1:16:21,65
Mike Murphy
At all?


927
1:16:21,65 --> 1:16:22,63
Paul E. Kanjorski
No.


928
1:16:22,63 --> 1:16:25,54
Mike Murphy
Okay, we have a letter from constituents and


929
1:16:25,54 --> 1:16:26,37
people have concerns.


930
1:16:26,37 --> 1:16:29,22
Paul E. Kanjorski [pointing to camera and
crew]


931
1:16:29,22 --> 1:16:30,29
What are you?


932
1:16:30,29 --> 1:16:33,34
Unknown crew member
We're making a documentary about the proceedings.


933
1:16:33,34 --> 1:16:33,79
Paul E. Kanjorski
I don't know. Do you guys have credentials


934
1:16:33,79 --> 1:16:33,91
to be here?


935
1:16:33,91 --> 1:16:34,35
Mike Murphy
Yes we do. We passed through security as well.


936
1:16:34,35 --> 1:16:34,5
Jeremy Rothe-Kushel
We are endowed by our creator . . .


937
1:16:34,5 --> 1:16:34,54
Paul E. Kanjowski [reaching for recording
equipment Rothe-Kushel holds]


938
1:16:34,54 --> 1:16:34,55
Please don't.


939
1:16:34,55 --> 1:16:34,58
Jeremy Rothe-Kushel
Please don't touch that. It's our property.


940
1:16:34,58 --> 1:16:34,61
Paul E. Kanjowski
You're lying.


941
1:16:34,61 --> 1:16:37,91
Jeremy Rothe-Kushel
No I'm not. What did I, what did we lie about?


942
1:16:37,91 --> 1:16:44,29
Paul E. Kanjowski
[mumbles]


943
1:16:44,29 --> 1:16:56,72
Jeremy Rothe-Kushel
What did we, what did we lie about? Sir, what


944
1:16:56,72 --> 1:16:57,99
are we lying about?


945
1:16:57,99 --> 1:16:59,9
Paul E. Kanjowski
[Walking away] mumbles


946
1:16:59,9 --> 1:17:1,66
Mike Murphy
That was a little unusual, huh?


947
1:17:1,66 --> 1:17:3,27
Saxby Chambliss Republican Senator Georgia
I haven't heard of that, no.


948
1:17:3,27 --> 1:17:3,42
Barbara Mikulski Democratic Senator Maryland

949
1:17:3,42 --> 1:17:3,61
Mike Murphy to Donna Edwards Democratic Representative
Maryland


950
1:17:3,61 --> 1:17:5,7
And it appears that these programs have already
been deployed . . .


951
1:17:5,7 --> 1:17:6,79
Randy Neugebauer Republican Representative
Texas


952
1:17:6,79 --> 1:17:10,5
You know I haven't looked at that proposal
and well, why don't you let me review it?


953
1:17:10,5 --> 1:17:12,22
Mike Murphy
I can do that, Sir. Actually, are you aware


954
1:17:12,22 --> 1:17:12,4
of . . . ?


955
1:17:12,4 --> 1:17:13,49
Randy Neugebauer
Actually, I'm going to . . . [walks away]


956
1:17:13,49 --> 1:17:14,58
Mike Murphy to Cliff Stearns Republican Representative
Florida


957
1:17:14,58 --> 1:17:15,27
Can we talk to you?


958
1:17:15,27 --> 1:17:15,95
Cliff Stearns
Yeah. [Walks away]


959
1:17:15,95 --> 1:17:17,85
Hank Johnson Democratic Representative Georgia
Let me go ahead and get that. [speaking to


960
1:17:17,85 --> 1:17:20,65
someone off to side then looking at Mike Murphy]
I will take a look at this and I will act


961
1:17:20,65 --> 1:17:20,67
accordingly.


962
1:17:20,67 --> 1:17:23,8
Mike Murphy to Lieutenant General James R.
Clapper Jr., Director of National Intelligence


963
1:17:23,8 --> 1:17:33,37
General, this openly covert program of aerosol
spraying, stratospheric aerosol spraying,


964
1:17:33,37 --> 1:17:37,41
geoengineering using tons of aluminum, spraying
it up in the sky . . .


965
1:17:37,41 --> 1:17:41,14
James R. Clapper Jr.
I have no idea what you're talking about.


966
1:17:41,14 --> 1:17:43,32
Jeremy Rothe-Kushel
It's commonly called chemtrails, Sir.


967
1:17:43,32 --> 1:17:45,33
Mike Murphy
When you were the head of NIMA did you see


968
1:17:45,33 --> 1:17:46,31
the aerosol trails?


969
1:17:46,31 --> 1:17:48,93
James R. Clapper Jr [Walks away]


970
1:17:48,93 --> 1:17:52,42
Mike Murphy to David Scott Democratic Representative
Georgia


971
1:17:52,42 --> 1:17:54,43
Mike Murphy, Sir, I'm here from Los Angeles.


972
1:17:54,43 --> 1:17:54,62
David Scott
Hi.


973
1:17:54,62 --> 1:17:55,26
Mike Murphy
Sir, we're here covering an issue called geoengineering


974
1:17:55,26 --> 1:17:58,1
and wanted to know if you're supportive of
geoengineers' proposals?


975
1:17:58,1 --> 1:18:0,42
David Scott [walks away]


976
1:18:0,42 --> 1:18:4,47
Mike Murphy to Tim Holden Democratic Representative
Pennsylvania


977
1:18:4,47 --> 1:18:11,77
Congressman . . . Are you supportive of geoengineers'
proposals which is dumping 10 to 20 million


978
1:18:11,77 --> 1:18:13,51
tons of aluminum into the atmosphere?


979
1:18:13,51 --> 1:18:18,25
Tim Holden
I'm not familiar with that.


980
1:18:18,25 --> 1:18:20,28
Mike Murphy
What?


981
1:18:20,28 --> 1:18:25,14
Tim Holden
I'm not familiar with what you're talking


982
1:18:25,14 --> 1:18:25,32
about. [walks away]


983
1:18:25,32 --> 1:18:26,5
Mark Schauer Democratic Representative Michigan
I'm not familiar with what you're talking


984
1:18:26,5 --> 1:18:26,72
about. Could you make an appointment with
my office? [walks away]


985
1:18:26,72 --> 1:18:27,51
Dale Kildee Democratic Representative Michigan
I'm not supportive, uh, I haven't looked at


986
1:18:27,51 --> 1:18:29,19
it so I don't . . .


987
1:18:29,19 --> 1:18:33,44
Mike Murphy
Have you heard of the issue? It's becoming


988
1:18:33,44 --> 1:18:37,75
mainstream and public and there are actually
congressional committees which are being formed


989
1:18:37,75 --> 1:18:39,15
to talk about the programs.


990
1:18:39,15 --> 1:18:42,35
Dale Kildee
Yeah, well, I think when you drop anything


991
1:18:42,35 --> 1:18:47,18
into the atmosphere you should know prior
to, the effect of that, right?


992
1:18:47,18 --> 1:18:48,19
Mike Murphy
Yes.


993
1:18:48,19 --> 1:18:51,27
Dale Kildee
And if you don't have the knowledge as to


994
1:18:51,27 --> 1:18:53,78
what the effect would be that we shouldn't
do it.


995
1:18:53,78 --> 1:18:56,94
Dr. Barrett [in Congress]
I think there are four different options for


996
1:18:56,94 --> 1:19:0,97
thinking about deployment of geoengineering.
The first one would be we just ban it.


997
1:19:0,97 --> 1:19:4,16
Dr. Morgan [in Congress]
I would argue that one does not want to get


998
1:19:4,16 --> 1:19:11,37
too firm a restriction in place on small scale
studies early on because it will tie the science's


999
1:19:11,37 --> 1:19:16,4
hands. I think what the science community
ought to be trying to do is say do small scale


1000
1:19:16,4 --> 1:19:21,9
stuff inside this space and it's a scientific
question what that space ought to be. And


1001
1:19:21,9 --> 1:19:24,45
there shouldn't be a lot of oversight and
restriction.


1002
1:19:24,45 --> 1:19:27,62
Mike Murphy to Harry Mitchell Democratic Representative
Arizona


1003
1:19:27,62 --> 1:19:31,53
Congressman . . . Hi, I'm Mike Murphy from
Los Angeles covering an issue called geoengineering.


1004
1:19:31,53 --> 1:19:33,1
Harry Mitchell [walks away]


1005
1:19:33,1 --> 1:19:36,35
Mike Murphy
These guys are running from the geoengineering


1006
1:19:36,35 --> 1:19:37,25
issue, I wonder why?


1007
1:19:37,25 --> 1:19:40,62
Charlie Wilson Democratic Representative Ohio
I'd have to talk to my staff. I don't know


1008
1:19:40,62 --> 1:19:41,42
what the details are.


1009
1:19:41,42 --> 1:19:43,51
Mike Murphy
Has anyone made you aware of the issue or?


1010
1:19:43,51 --> 1:19:43,77
Sir?


1011
1:19:43,77 --> 1:19:44,8
Charlie Wilson [walks away]


1012
1:19:44,8 --> 1:19:47,63
Jeremy Rothe-Kushel approaching Ralph Hall
and Michael T. McCaul Representatives Texas


1013
1:19:47,63 --> 1:19:51,63
Congressmen, did anyone talk to you about
the issue of geoengineering last November?


1014
1:19:51,63 --> 1:19:56,11
Are you supportive of these proposals? We
would love to give you a paper.


1015
1:19:56,11 --> 1:19:57,55
[Both representatives walk away]


1016
1:19:57,55 --> 1:19:59,7
Barney Frank Democratic Representative Massachusetts
Which?


1017
1:19:59,7 --> 1:20:2,42
Mike Murphy
Geoengineering, do you know anything about


1018
1:20:2,42 --> 1:20:3,15
the geoengineering issue?


1019
1:20:3,15 --> 1:20:5,16
Barney Frank
Never heard of it.


1020
1:20:5,16 --> 1:20:7,4
Jeremy Rothe-Kushel
They call it geoengineering but . . .


1021
1:20:7,4 --> 1:20:9,37
Barney Frank
Yeah and I've never heard of it. It's nothing


1022
1:20:9,37 --> 1:20:10,43
I've ever heard anything about.


1023
1:20:10,43 --> 1:20:15,39
Jeremy Rothe-Kushel
When we looked up in the air today outside,


1024
1:20:15,39 --> 1:20:19,97
you see, we saw this stuff going on.


1025
1:20:19,97 --> 1:20:19,97
Barney Frank [Walks away]


1026
1:20:19,97 --> 1:20:19,97
Jeremy Rothe-Kushel to Maxine Waters Democratic
Representative California


1027
1:20:19,97 --> 1:20:20,46
[Something unclear] Have you heard of geoengineering?


1028
1:20:20,46 --> 1:20:20,75
Maxine Waters
No.


1029
1:20:20,75 --> 1:20:21,81
Jeremy Rothe-Kushel
The proposal is to shoot 10 million tons of


1030
1:20:21,81 --> 1:20:25,68
metals into the air. This committee in science
and technology covered it and so we're here


1031
1:20:25,68 --> 1:20:25,68
. . .


1032
1:20:25,68 --> 1:20:26,89
Maxine Waters
No, I've never heard of it.


1033
1:20:26,89 --> 1:20:27,79
Jeremy Rothe-Kushel
So we're very concerned.


1034
1:20:27,79 --> 1:20:28,99
Maxine Waters [to someone farther away, ignoring
question]


1035
1:20:28,99 --> 1:20:30,3
Hey! How are you doing? I'm fine.


1036
1:20:30,3 --> 1:20:31,8
Maxine Waters [to documentary crew]
So, what?


1037
1:20:31,8 --> 1:20:33,86
Jeremy Rothe-Kushel
Well w spoke with congresswoman Watson's office


1038
1:20:33,86 --> 1:20:40,18
and her press secretary Ms. White, is familiar
with Representative Kucinich's Space Preservation


1039
1:20:40,18 --> 1:20:45,19
Act which mentioned chemtrails and the weaponization
of the atmosphere and space and then it was


1040
1:20:45,19 --> 1:20:53,83
pressured to be taken off of the bill. Did
you see the aerosol spraying going on today


1041
1:20:53,83 --> 1:20:54,52
over the capitol?


1042
1:20:54,52 --> 1:20:55,76
Maxine Waters [Walks away]


1043
1:20:55,76 --> 1:20:58,23
Mike Murphy to Bob Latta Republican Representative
Ohio


1044
1:20:58,23 --> 1:20:58,54
Congressman?


1045
1:20:58,54 --> 1:21:0,7
Bob Latta
I'll get you. [Walks away]


1046
1:21:0,7 --> 1:21:3,47
Bart Gordon Democratic Representative Tennessee
– in session in Congress


1047
1:21:3,47 --> 1:21:8,33
Geoengineering carries with it a tremendous
range of uncertainties, ethical and political


1048
1:21:8,33 --> 1:21:12,12
concerns, and potential for catastrophic environmental
side effects.


1049
1:21:12,12 --> 1:21:17,85
Staff Person [in Bart Gordon's office]
He is not one to do interviews very often,


1050
1:21:17,85 --> 1:21:23,32
not usually unless we pressure him into it,
so don't hold your breath.


1051
1:21:23,32 --> 1:21:27,98
Bart Gordon – in session in Congress
As chairman of the Committee of Jurisdiction


1052
1:21:27,98 --> 1:21:32,85
I feel a responsibility to begin a public
dialogue and begin a record on geoengineering.


1053
1:21:32,85 --> 1:21:37,4
Mike Murphy [to Bart Gordon in the hall]
We want to know if you're supportive of spraying


1054
1:21:37,4 --> 1:21:39,82
of 10 to 20 million tons of aluminum into
the atmosphere?


1055
1:21:39,82 --> 1:21:41,79
Bart Gordon
No. No, we need to have more research.


1056
1:21:41,79 --> 1:21:44,65
Mike Murphy
Okay. And about the issue of current deployment,


1057
1:21:44,65 --> 1:21:50,8
there's literally a mountain of evidence that
many people believe proves deployment of these


1058
1:21:50,8 --> 1:21:52,42
programs. Any knowledge of that?


1059
1:21:52,42 --> 1:21:55,32
Bart Gordon
No. No, there's not a mountain of evidence.


1060
1:21:55,32 --> 1:22:2,17
But I do support research into geoengineering
and I also support looking into the issue


1061
1:22:2,17 --> 1:22:5,21
of international governance on that. I hope
anybody that's studied it knows that I think


1062
1:22:5,21 --> 1:22:11,7
it's a radical proposal and I hope we don't
have to use it but there may come that point


1063
1:22:11,7 --> 1:22:12,17
in time where we do.
Mike Murphy


1064
1:22:12,17 --> 1:22:17,96
Now, if we could provide you with evidence
that these programs are and have been ongoing,


1065
1:22:17,96 --> 1:22:19,74
would you be willing to address this publicly?


1066
1:22:19,74 --> 1:22:20,65
Bart Gordon
We've had three or four hearings on it. We


1067
1:22:20,65 --> 1:22:24,96
have addressed it publicly.


1068
1:22:24,96 --> 1:22:27,6
Mike Murphy
Well, not about the proposals, but about the


1069
1:22:27,6 --> 1:22:29,77
current deployment of these programs. Citizens
. . .


1070
1:22:29,77 --> 1:22:31,82
Bart Gordon
Well, I don't support current deployment.


1071
1:22:31,82 --> 1:22:36,67
We need to have more research and they have
consequences that go beyond one nation then


1072
1:22:36,67 --> 1:22:40,27
I think we need to look into the governance
of that.


1073
1:22:40,27 --> 1:22:40,27
Catherine Redgwell – Professor of International
Law


1074
1:22:40,27 --> 1:22:45,73
Governance is not simply an issue of deployment
but governance before deployment in terms


1075
1:22:45,73 --> 1:22:49,47
of particularly of large scale scientific
field work.


1076
1:22:49,47 --> 1:22:53,92
Webcast – speaker unknown
I concede that on this subject and in general


1077
1:22:53,92 --> 1:22:55,76
it's not popular to talk about global rules.


1078
1:22:55,76 --> 1:22:57,27
Stewart Howe – in discussion with Mike Murphy
and Jeremy Rothe-Kushel


1079
1:22:57,27 --> 1:23:2,42
And when those people started talking about
the need for UN Security Council oversight,


1080
1:23:2,42 --> 1:23:9,79
a supranational environmental security enforcement
with a strong mandate by the UN, you know.


1081
1:23:9,79 --> 1:23:16,61
It really is clear that they're looking for
a global power behind the manipulation of


1082
1:23:16,61 --> 1:23:17,0
the environment.


1083
1:23:17,0 --> 1:23:21,21
“FORA tv” Webcast – host unknown
But I do think it needs to be an international


1084
1:23:21,21 --> 1:23:26,25
kind of treaty that does tie and bind all
nations into a common fate. It is a common


1085
1:23:26,25 --> 1:23:26,35
fate.


1086

Webcast of Council of Foreign Relations – speaker
unknown


1087
1:23:27,8 --> 1:23:32,39
And unfortunately, it's not just big governments
that could do this. It is small governments.


1088
1:23:32,39 --> 1:23:37,66
It is billionaires probably who will go “I'm
going to save the world all by myself and


1089
1:23:37,66 --> 1:23:38,9
I won't bother to mention it.”


1090
1:23:38,9 --> 1:23:41,5
Online Newscast TVO Speaker unknown
How do we decide when there's a planetary


1091
1:23:41,5 --> 1:23:47,21
emergency? Whose hand is on the thermostat?
How do we decide when to start? There's no


1092
1:23:47,21 --> 1:23:53,75
way to do that right now. And what if we do
start doing it and then by some problem with


1093
1:23:53,75 --> 1:24:0,84
the technology or with the will we can no
longer do it? And in a year or two the aerosols


1094
1:24:0,84 --> 1:24:5,94
will come out of the atmosphere and temperatures
will shoot up at a rate much faster than it's


1095
1:24:5,94 --> 1:24:10,29
going up now. And it's that rate of change
that's hard for us to adapt to. And so once


1096
1:24:10,29 --> 1:24:14,87
we start it, we'll be sort of locked into
doing it for a long long time. And with no


1097
1:24:14,87 --> 1:24:15,53
end in sight.

Webcast “Geoengineering: Salvation or Ruin?”
on “FORA tv” - speaker unknown


1099
1:24:17,75 --> 1:24:21,54
Boeing would pursue this to make a profit,
right? And has financial motivation to do


1100
1:24:21,54 --> 1:24:21,85
this.


1101
1:24:21,85 --> 1:24:25,96
“FORA tv” webcast – Second unknown speaker
And so, let me not speak for Boeing.


1102
1:24:25,96 --> 1:24:28,18
“FORA tv” webcast – First speaker
Is that allowed?


1103
1:24:28,18 --> 1:24:31,98
“FORA tv” webcast – Second speaker
Well, it is what it is.


1104
1:24:31,98 --> 1:24:33,84
“FORA tv” webcast – First speaker
But if some day the US is going to decide


1105
1:24:33,84 --> 1:24:39,7
to do this stuff, they're going to look to
a company that can do it and you would want


1106
1:24:39,7 --> 1:24:43,13
to be positioned . . . Boeing would rather
get it than Lockheed Martin.


1107
1:24:43,13 --> 1:24:44,23
[Clip to website with an article titled: “Who
Gets Rich in a Geoengineering World?”]


1108
1:24:44,23 --> 1:24:46,88
“FORA tv” webcast – Second speaker
So certainly we have an industrial base that


1109
1:24:46,88 --> 1:24:53,56
helps the country take on technologies and
large scale challenges like national defense


1110
1:24:53,56 --> 1:25:0,98
and we do that both for a profit motive as
well as, I think, a national service.

Webcast of Council on Foreign Relations – speaker
unknown


1112
1:25:2,15 --> 1:25:8,81
I think it would be truly disastrous if you
know, if we discovered there was a black program


1113
1:25:8,81 --> 1:25:14,9
that some government had stood up to sort
of learn on the quiet how to do this.

TVO Webcast entitled “Geoengineering: Plan
B?” - Speakers in Calgary, and Paris, France


1115
1:25:14,59 --> 1:25:16,1
Calgary speaker – unknown
It's pretty clear you can cool the planet


1116
1:25:16,1 --> 1:25:20,5
but you will not and cannot bring it back
to the exact same climate state you started


1117
1:25:20,5 --> 1:25:24,79
with. So you may or may not, I suspect, have
a lot of back and forth about how useful it


1118
1:25:24,79 --> 1:25:28,47
is to ameliorate the risks of climate change.
I think there's probably good evidence that


1119
1:25:28,47 --> 1:25:33,45
it is useful but I don't know. But it certainly
can't get you back to the climate you started


1120
1:25:33,45 --> 1:25:34,7
with. Everybody agrees with that.

Webcast of “FORA tv” Panel discussion

1122
1:25:35,5 --> 1:25:36,93

1123
1:25:36,93 --> 1:25:39,3

Let me say I hope not.

1126
1:25:42,35 --> 1:25:45,51
I would agree. I hope not.


1127
1:25:45,51 --> 1:25:50,4
Other new speaker
I would see this as something like an evacuation


1128
1:25:50,4 --> 1:25:57,3
plan, you know, that you build big dikes and
emissions reduction to try to keep the flood


1129
1:25:57,3 --> 1:26:4,69
from wiping you out, but if that flood should
come you'd like to have a back up plan for


1130
1:26:4,69 --> 1:26:9,65
what to do in the event of that catastrophe
so I can see those options more as a catastrophic


1131
1:26:9,65 --> 1:26:15,94
response option and not as a way to reduce
risk of everyday climate change.

of North Carolina speaking


1133
1:26:16,57 --> 1:26:23,19
You would advocate mitigating consumption

1134
1:26:23,19 --> 1:26:25,52
Speaker in front row
Uh, yes.


1135
1:26:25,52 --> 1:26:28,2
Mr. Smith
How would you suggest going about that?


1136
1:26:28,2 --> 1:26:32,61
Speaker in front row
You can't uh, I can't uh . . . It's your job


1137
1:26:32,61 --> 1:26:37,0
to decide what to tax and what not to tax,
obviously, if you wanted to, people do behave


1138
1:26:37,0 --> 1:26:39,89
differently, you'd give them incentives and
disincentives for behavior.


1139
1:26:39,89 --> 1:26:41,96
Another speaker
I'm sure that's the answer you wanted to hear,


1140

Mr. Smith.


1141
1:26:42,4 --> 1:26:46,52

Jeremy Rothe-Kushel
Like today over the Capitol it looks like


1148
1:26:54,7 --> 1:26:56,24
maybe they're deploying some sort of aerosol,
did you see it?


1149
1:26:56,24 --> 1:26:58,11
Bart Gordon
No I didn't. [The rest is unclear]


1150
1:26:58,11 --> 1:27:3,17
Mr. Bard speaking in Congress in session
In a James Bond scenario some sort of rogue


1151
1:27:3,17 --> 1:27:6,53
rich guy puts some planes in the air and seeds
the clouds. What is to prevent that?


1152
1:27:6,53 --> 1:27:9,47
Ron Wyden Democratic Senator Oregon
[Something unclear] I'll be glad to talk to


1153
1:27:9,47 --> 1:27:10,6
you, just call my office.


1154
1:27:10,6 --> 1:27:12,5
Mike Murphy
Are you aware of the issue?


1155
1:27:12,5 --> 1:27:14,73
Ron Wyden
As I said, I do it through the office.


1156
1:27:14,73 --> 1:27:16,69
Mike Murphy to Bobby Rush Democratic Representative
Illinois


1157
1:27:16,69 --> 1:27:21,2
Are you in support of those proposals? What
is your take?


1158
1:27:21,2 --> 1:27:24,83
Bobby Rush
I don't know anything about it and I'm running


1159
1:27:24,83 --> 1:27:24,96
late. I have to chair a hearing.


1160
1:27:24,96 --> 1:27:25,9
Mike Murphy
Okay, we'll give you a letter on this. Okay,


1161
1:27:25,9 --> 1:27:31,72
this is a letter from constituents and many
people believe that these programs have already


1162
1:27:31,72 --> 1:27:34,8
been deployed because massive contamination
has been found.


1163
1:27:34,8 --> 1:27:37,78
[Bobby Rush's Aide takes the letter for him]
Aide


1164
1:27:37,78 --> 1:27:39,56
I have no idea what you mean by “these programs”,
one word or two . . .


1165
1:27:39,56 --> 1:27:40,4
Mike Murphy
Geoengineering programs.


1166
1:27:40,4 --> 1:27:41,1
Aide
Geoengineering. Got it. Glad you brought it


1167
1:27:41,1 --> 1:27:41,13
up.


1168
1:27:41,13 --> 1:27:42,79
Mike Murphy
Yes, spraying from airplanes, so what is happening


1169
1:27:42,79 --> 1:27:44,85
is people from around the world are finding
contamination.


1170
1:27:44,85 --> 1:27:48,24
Aide
Let me take care of this and I'll talk with


1171
1:27:48,24 --> 1:27:48,31
you when I come back.


1172
1:27:48,31 --> 1:27:48,84
Mike Murphy
Thank you very much!


1173
1:27:48,84 --> 1:27:50,26
Webcast on Geoengineering II: The Scientific
Basis and Engineering Challenges


1174
1:27:50,26 --> 1:27:53,94
We see that even though we might make the
average temperature of the planet about right


1175
1:27:53,94 --> 1:27:58,68
the rainfall patterns change some from today
and some places become a little warmer and


1176
1:27:58,68 --> 1:28:6,13
some cooler so there are going to be winners
and losers in this geoengineering activity


1177
1:28:6,13 --> 1:28:12,82
if we were to do it, but nevertheless as David
has said, there are reasons why we might consider


1178
1:28:12,82 --> 1:28:13,48
doing it.


1179
1:28:13,48 --> 1:28:16,73
Mike Murphy speaking with Carolyn Maloney
Democratic Representative New York


1180
1:28:16,73 --> 1:28:20,51
Many people are deeply concerned about it
because of the toxicity of aluminum, and it


1181
1:28:20,51 --> 1:28:26,67
has been addressed to Congress in various
committees. Would you take a look at a letter


1182
1:28:26,67 --> 1:28:29,0
from some of your constituents addressing
the concerns?


1183
1:28:29,0 --> 1:28:29,8
[Carolyn Maloney walks away]


1184
1:28:29,8 --> 1:28:29,79
John Barrow Democratic Representative Georgia
Please excuse me if I go . . .


1185
1:28:29,79 --> 1:28:34,18
Mike Murphy
Can I give you a letter from constituents?


1186
1:28:34,18 --> 1:28:36,5
Are you aware of their proposals of dumping
. . .


1187
1:28:36,5 --> 1:28:36,9
John Barrow [while reaching for letter]
I'm running a little bit late.


1188
1:28:36,9 --> 1:28:38,12
Mike Murphy
Got you. Thanks.


1189
1:28:38,12 --> 1:28:43,46
Gene Green Democratic Representative Texas
Well, I'm not familiar with it so I don't


1190
1:28:43,46 --> 1:28:44,99
know what to do.


1191
1:28:44,99 --> 1:28:48,11
Mike Murphy
Okay well, geoengineers are proposing just


1192
1:28:48,11 --> 1:28:50,98
that, dumping aluminum and barium into the
atmosphere . . .


1193
1:28:50,98 --> 1:28:52,99
Gene Green
Well, aluminum is a precious metal we could


1194
1:28:52,99 --> 1:28:53,19
use.


1195
1:28:53,19 --> 1:28:56,38
Mike Murphy
Well the stated goal is to actually cool the


1196
1:28:56,38 --> 1:28:57,49
planet however . . .


1197
1:28:57,49 --> 1:29:0,37
Gene Green
It sounds strange.


1198
1:29:0,37 --> 1:29:3,4
Mike Murphy
Exactly, so they're proposing dumping these


1199
1:29:3,4 --> 1:29:9,72
metals into the air to block the sun essentially.
So we're just here to find out what members


1200
1:29:9,72 --> 1:29:10,55
of Congress are . . .


1201
1:29:10,55 --> 1:29:12,7
Gene Green
Well, I hope we have a strong hearing on that


1202
1:29:12,7 --> 1:29:13,55
before they do anything.


1203
1:29:13,55 --> 1:29:16,5
Mike Murphy
I hope so. And there's evidence that suggests


1204
1:29:16,5 --> 1:29:21,7
that not only have these programs been deployed
because we're finding contamination of aluminum


1205
1:29:21,7 --> 1:29:22,94
and barium in the rains, snow, and soil.


1206
1:29:22,94 --> 1:29:24,99
Gene Green
Okay, thank you. [walks away taking letter]


1207
1:29:24,99 --> 1:29:25,9
Mike Murphy
Thank you.


1208
1:29:25,9 --> 1:29:27,72
Jeremy Rothe-Kushel speaking to Senator Dianne
Feinstein California


1209
1:29:27,72 --> 1:29:37,36
L.A. County has seen a two hundred percent
increase in Alzheimer’s in the last decade


1210
1:29:37,36 --> 1:29:38,58
and tons of ground water samples showing high
levels of aluminum all around our state.


1211
1:29:38,58 --> 1:29:40,82
Dianne Feinstein
Why don't you give me all the information


1212
1:29:40,82 --> 1:29:49,19
you have? I have some very good people I will
assign it to and if you get it to Mr. Lavelle.


1213
1:29:49,19 --> 1:29:54,64
Mr. Lavelle
Just scan my card and send me an email and


1214
1:29:54,64 --> 1:29:54,72
we'll . . .


1215
1:29:54,72 --> 1:29:55,53
Mike Murphy
We'll be in touch, we are investigating this


1216
1:29:55,53 --> 1:29:58,74
and there is literally a mountain of evidence
that suggests these programs are going on.


1217
1:29:58,74 --> 1:30:3,27
Dianne Feinstein
Okay, move that mountain over to us and we'll


1218
1:30:3,27 --> 1:30:3,45
look at it.


1219
1:30:3,45 --> 1:30:5,16
Jeremy Rothe-Kushel
And look up, just looking up into the sky


1220
1:30:5,16 --> 1:30:5,82
you will see some . . .
Dianne Feinstein


1221
1:30:5,82 --> 1:30:5,97
Okay.


1222
1:30:5,97 --> 1:30:8,86
Mike Murphy
You will, you can see aerosols being sprayed


1223
1:30:8,86 --> 1:30:13,89
out of airplanes quite a bit so thank you,
yeah, the future of humanity is definitely


1224
1:30:13,89 --> 1:30:19,93
dependent on it so we're counting on people
like yourself to take some proactive steps,


1225
1:30:19,93 --> 1:30:21,86
so thank you very much guys.


1226
1:30:21,86 --> 1:30:26,22
Dianne Feinstein
Very well. You're welcome.


1227
1:30:26,22 --> 1:30:32,35
Jeremy Rothe-Kushel now outside
A lot of Congress was running down the hallways


1228
1:30:32,35 --> 1:30:39,82
to avoid answering any questions, looking
for doors in the hallways so apparently the


1229
1:30:39,82 --> 1:30:47,18
war is against all of us. And we're all in
a hostage crisis. People who took an oath


1230
1:30:47,18 --> 1:30:51,92
to uphold and defend the Constitution not
only know this is happening, but are participating


1231
1:30:51,92 --> 1:30:58,45
in this and all of us have a duty to stand
up and speak out about it. Why is the water


1232
1:30:58,45 --> 1:31:3,33
being contaminated? Why is the soil being
contaminated? Why are aluminum-related diseases


1233
1:31:3,33 --> 1:31:9,3
going up and it affecting all of us? And thus
we all have the duty to stand up and speak


1234
1:31:9,3 --> 1:31:14,9
out and get educated and stop this for our
own sake, for our children's sake. It is a


1235
1:31:14,9 --> 1:31:21,7
crucial moment in history right now. As human
beings we need to decide whether to live on


1236
1:31:21,7 --> 1:31:29,9
our knees while being sprayed and poisoned
every day under continual threat or whether


1237
1:31:29,9 --> 1:31:36,74
we are going to stand up and live as free
human beings and seek truth, justice, peace


1238
1:31:36,74 --> 1:31:39,8
and freedom for all of God's children.


1239
1:31:39,8 --> 1:31:42,75
Mike Murphy
So as you can see we are ending our film here


1240
1:31:42,75 --> 1:31:48,4
in Washington DC, we've made many public officials
aware of this, most of them either denied


1241
1:31:48,4 --> 1:31:54,58
any knowledge of this or they simply were
unwilling to address the situation with us.


1242
1:31:54,58 --> 1:31:59,52
So as you can see right here behind us you
can see aerosols behind us, the spraying has


1243
1:31:59,52 --> 1:32:5,3
continued. So what is the solution? Is the
solution here in Washington DC ? Clearly this


1244
1:32:5,3 --> 1:32:10,65
is one of the solutions, but the solution
is not only here, the solution is within you.


1245
1:32:10,65 --> 1:32:16,87
This issue affects all of us so deeply so
you need to decide. Get active, get involved.


1246
1:32:16,87 --> 1:32:21,88
Start spreading the word with growing awareness
about 90 percent of the population, we believe,


1247
1:32:21,88 --> 1:32:26,43
is unaware of this issue which means that
90 percent of the people who would normally


1248
1:32:26,43 --> 1:32:31,16
do something if they knew are not doing anything
because they aren't aware. So please look


1249
1:32:31,16 --> 1:32:36,5
into your heart, use any skill you have to
get the word out. The future of humanity is


1250
1:32:36,5 --> 1:32:37,19
dependent upon it.


1251
1:32:37,19 --> 1:34:37,19
