1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:8,109



2
0:0:8,109 --> 0:0:9,59
PATRICK O'DELL: Oh,
what's this photo?


3
0:0:9,59 --> 0:0:10,8
JAMES KELCH: Oh, damn.


4
0:0:10,8 --> 0:0:13,81
That's 1987.


5
0:0:13,81 --> 0:0:16,87
Backside smith stall.


6
0:0:16,87 --> 0:0:18,79
Could be '88, it's
probably '88.


7
0:0:18,79 --> 0:0:21,14
But anyway, it's a backside
smith stall in the big block


8
0:0:21,14 --> 0:0:21,87
at Embarcadero.


9
0:0:21,87 --> 0:0:22,99
PATRICK O'DELL: With
sweatpants?


10
0:0:22,99 --> 0:0:25,93
JAMES KELCH: Yeah, sweatpants
and a generic indie shirt my


11
0:0:25,93 --> 0:0:31,45
mom got at the flea market, And
that one is 1986 with the


12
0:0:31,45 --> 0:0:34,7
SMA shirt, olleying a bum that's
sleeping on the way.


13
0:0:34,7 --> 0:0:35,61
PATRICK O'DELL: Hi, what's up?


14
0:0:35,61 --> 0:0:37,55
Welcome back to the Epicly
Later'd show.


15
0:0:37,55 --> 0:0:41,9
This episode is about
James Kelch.


16
0:0:41,9 --> 0:0:43,11
When I first moved to San
Francisco and I wanted to be a


17
0:0:43,11 --> 0:0:46,94
skate photographer, he was
probably the first pro that I


18
0:0:46,94 --> 0:0:48,54
got to shoot pictures with.


19
0:0:48,54 --> 0:0:52,92
James Kelch in the early '90s
was known as the Mayor of EMB.


20
0:0:52,92 --> 0:0:55,945
People always have stories about
people being jerks down


21
0:0:55,945 --> 0:0:58,83
at EMB, but James being
really cool.


22
0:0:58,83 --> 0:1:0,84
But he did definitely
run some scams.


23
0:1:0,84 --> 0:1:5,129
We asked James some questions,
and then I'll run it by Maza


24
0:1:5,129 --> 0:1:7,49
or Mike Carroll and they'll
say that what he's


25
0:1:7,49 --> 0:1:8,87
saying's not true.


26
0:1:8,87 --> 0:1:10,55
But then there were some things
he told me that I


27
0:1:10,55 --> 0:1:14,2
didn't think were true, and
then they were true.


28
0:1:14,2 --> 0:1:16,47
I don't know, I think he's just
a really good storyteller


29
0:1:16,47 --> 0:1:19,8
and he likes to embellish
a little bit maybe.


30
0:1:19,8 --> 0:1:22,515
People talk about James like
he's a super amazing skater.


31
0:1:22,515 --> 0:1:25,14
So in the course of making this
episode, Maza sent us


32
0:1:25,14 --> 0:1:28,73
lost Kelch tapes that I think
are really awesome and really


33
0:1:28,73 --> 0:1:32,175
show why he was pro.


34
0:1:32,175 --> 0:1:34,7
And here it is, James
Kelch episode.


35
0:1:34,7 --> 0:1:36,71



36
0:1:36,71 --> 0:1:39,196
How long did you live
in Ohio for?


37
0:1:39,196 --> 0:1:41,37
JAMES KELCH: Before I went
to San Francisco?


38
0:1:41,37 --> 0:1:42,15
Hardly at all.


39
0:1:42,15 --> 0:1:44,614
I was born here and we were in
a military family, we moved


40
0:1:44,614 --> 0:1:45,65
around a lot.


41
0:1:45,65 --> 0:1:47,92
So hardly at all, ever.


42
0:1:47,92 --> 0:1:49,65
Just come to visit and
stuff like that.


43
0:1:49,65 --> 0:1:52,54
I moved to San Francisco from
Shreveport, Louisiana.


44
0:1:52,54 --> 0:1:54,9
PATRICK O'DELL: You went to high
school in San Francisco?


45
0:1:54,9 --> 0:1:56,63
JAMES KELCH: Yeah, I went to
middle school and high school.


46
0:1:56,63 --> 0:1:59,45
Trail Hill Middle School,
Galileo High School.


47
0:1:59,45 --> 0:2:1,56
PATRICK O'DELL: Galileo,
the one in--


48
0:2:1,56 --> 0:2:2,49
JAMES KELCH: OJ went
to school.


49
0:2:2,49 --> 0:2:6,29
It's on Van Ness down
by the wharf.


50
0:2:6,29 --> 0:2:8,19
It's a pretty gnarly,
rugged school, man.


51
0:2:8,19 --> 0:2:9,69
Sure changed the way
I look at stuff.


52
0:2:9,69 --> 0:2:11,515
PATRICK O'DELL: Then how'd
you start skating?


53
0:2:11,515 --> 0:2:13,58
JAMES KELCH: I lived
on [INAUDIBLE]


54
0:2:13,58 --> 0:2:15,52
Island and I was just cruising
around on my bike one day and


55
0:2:15,52 --> 0:2:19,255
I seen this kid skating down in
one of the little squares.


56
0:2:19,255 --> 0:2:20,84
I don't know what they're
called, cul-de-sacs or


57
0:2:20,84 --> 0:2:22,6
something like that?


58
0:2:22,6 --> 0:2:23,38
Just some kid back
there skating.


59
0:2:23,38 --> 0:2:25,12
He did a little bonus off a
bumper of a car, all these


60
0:2:25,12 --> 0:2:27,7
people were around
all fired up.


61
0:2:27,7 --> 0:2:28,1
And I was like wow,
that's dope.


62
0:2:28,1 --> 0:2:29,85
PATRICK O'DELL: Do when'd
you first go to EMB?


63
0:2:29,85 --> 0:2:32,27
JAMES KELCH: I went to EMB the
first time around in the


64
0:2:32,27 --> 0:2:34,18
middle of '85 or so.


65
0:2:34,18 --> 0:2:37,24
I took the bus into the city,
got off just to skate around,


66
0:2:37,24 --> 0:2:38,25
first time skating
in the city.


67
0:2:38,25 --> 0:2:40,2
And I asked some random kid with
a skateboard, where do


68
0:2:40,2 --> 0:2:40,56
people skate?


69
0:2:40,56 --> 0:2:42,23
And he's like, well, there's
this plaza down the street.


70
0:2:42,23 --> 0:2:43,34
I see skaters there every
once in a while.


71
0:2:43,34 --> 0:2:46,49
I just skated down there
and never left.


72
0:2:46,49 --> 0:2:48,44
PATRICK O'DELL: So it wasn't
a spot that people skated


73
0:2:48,44 --> 0:2:49,97
regularly then?


74
0:2:49,97 --> 0:2:51,5
JAMES KELCH: Not at all.


75
0:2:51,5 --> 0:2:52,92
I'd go there all the time,
there'd be no one


76
0:2:52,92 --> 0:2:54,45
ever, all day long.


77
0:2:54,45 --> 0:2:56,1
Me and someone I might
have come with.


78
0:2:56,1 --> 0:2:58,12
And then randomly though,
you'd see maybe Tommy or


79
0:2:58,12 --> 0:3:0,69
someone would skate through,
do a few tricks and leave.


80
0:3:0,69 --> 0:3:3,27
But mostly you would see Ken
McGuire doing hand plants.


81
0:3:3,27 --> 0:3:5,89



82
0:3:5,89 --> 0:3:7,42
I used to get heckled
for sitting down


83
0:3:7,42 --> 0:3:8,3
there all the time.


84
0:3:8,3 --> 0:3:10,21
I used to tell them I wasn't
a real skater.


85
0:3:10,21 --> 0:3:13,44
Until I'd blow their spots and
show them that if you learn to


86
0:3:13,44 --> 0:3:16,34
skate one place, you can skate
anywhere, you dummies.


87
0:3:16,34 --> 0:3:21,33
SAM SMYTH: Back then if I'm
11-years-old, this is '87.


88
0:3:21,33 --> 0:3:24,46
If you skated in '87 and you
bumped into a kid in San


89
0:3:24,46 --> 0:3:27,15
Francisco, told him you skated,
he'd ask you how high


90
0:3:27,15 --> 0:3:27,99
could you ollie.


91
0:3:27,99 --> 0:3:29,81
If you could ollie the highest,
then you was the best


92
0:3:29,81 --> 0:3:30,84
skater out there.


93
0:3:30,84 --> 0:3:33,66
And Kelch, for sure, could
ollie the highest in


94
0:3:33,66 --> 0:3:34,91
Embarcadero.


95
0:3:34,91 --> 0:3:49,919



96
0:3:49,919 --> 0:3:52,5
AARON MEZA: At the time I'd been
going to Embarcadero for


97
0:3:52,5 --> 0:3:54,61
a long time just randomly.


98
0:3:54,61 --> 0:3:57,56
Because I lived just
outside SF.


99
0:3:57,56 --> 0:4:0,45
And he's somebody I seen there
throughout the years.


100
0:4:0,45 --> 0:4:4,346
One day I was just filming my
friend and he was like hey, do


101
0:4:4,346 --> 0:4:5,16
you want to film some stuff?


102
0:4:5,16 --> 0:4:6,893
And we filmed a couple
lines of lines


103
0:4:6,893 --> 0:4:7,942
and a couple of tricks.


104
0:4:7,942 --> 0:4:11,0
So I would just go film with him
and that dude Jake Vogel.


105
0:4:11,0 --> 0:4:12,79
He was trying to get on
one-on-one with Jake.


106
0:4:12,79 --> 0:4:15,11
We'd come this one line, like he
seriously skated the whole


107
0:4:15,11 --> 0:4:16,68
place, it was super sick.


108
0:4:16,68 --> 0:4:39,47



109
0:4:39,47 --> 0:4:41,8
He had been sponsored, but I
think Dogtown might have went


110
0:4:41,8 --> 0:4:42,81
out of business.


111
0:4:42,81 --> 0:4:46,18
Maybe a week later, it was
funny, he was like there's


112
0:4:46,18 --> 0:4:48,81
this company, all these dudes
are going to quit H-Street,


113
0:4:48,81 --> 0:4:50,64
Mike Churnowski's leaving.


114
0:4:50,64 --> 0:4:51,31
It's going to be called--


115
0:4:51,31 --> 0:4:52,77
I don't know if he
knew the name.


116
0:4:52,77 --> 0:4:53,35
I guess he knew the name.


117
0:4:53,35 --> 0:4:54,73
It was going to be
called Plan B.


118
0:4:54,73 --> 0:4:57,58
He named off all the dudes, he
was like it's going to be


119
0:4:57,58 --> 0:5:1,28
Carroll, Hensley, Sheffy,
Rick Howard, Danny Way.


120
0:5:1,28 --> 0:5:2,72
He's like they maybe
want me to be the


121
0:5:2,72 --> 0:5:4,24
AN like Jason Carney.


122
0:5:4,24 --> 0:5:6,5
I remember that was
another AN.


123
0:5:6,5 --> 0:5:8,88
He might have said Eric Coston,
too, but he definitely


124
0:5:8,88 --> 0:5:10,29
said Jason Carney.


125
0:5:10,29 --> 0:5:12,15
Was going to be the
AN with him.


126
0:5:12,15 --> 0:5:15,15
So that's what we were filming
for, his Plan B sponsor video.


127
0:5:15,15 --> 0:5:17,8
But then I think later I got to
know Mike and he was more


128
0:5:17,8 --> 0:5:21,19
like yeah, I think it was just
me being like yeah, you should


129
0:5:21,19 --> 0:5:22,28
try to get on.


130
0:5:22,28 --> 0:5:25,6
And at that time, I was like
James was so good, it made


131
0:5:25,6 --> 0:5:26,21
sense to me.


132
0:5:26,21 --> 0:5:28,22
I was like that's sick, dude,
that'd be so rad.


133
0:5:28,22 --> 0:5:30,23
PATRICK O'DELL: Did the footage
you filmed with James,


134
0:5:30,23 --> 0:5:31,585
the early footage,
end up anywhere?


135
0:5:31,585 --> 0:5:32,835
AARON MEZA: No, none of it.


136
0:5:32,835 --> 0:5:37,666



137
0:5:37,666 --> 0:5:40,97
-You know, he was a little bit
older, he could fight, he can


138
0:5:40,97 --> 0:5:42,145
hook up with chicks.


139
0:5:42,145 --> 0:5:45,82
So he was like a cool dude to
all those dudes, so they all


140
0:5:45,82 --> 0:5:46,97
looked up to him.


141
0:5:46,97 --> 0:5:49,64
As many people like maybe he
was mean to, which I don't


142
0:5:49,64 --> 0:5:51,47
think was that many, he probably
would be the one dude


143
0:5:51,47 --> 0:5:55,155
who would say hi to a random
guy out of town, you know?


144
0:5:55,155 --> 0:5:58,24
SAM SMYTH: People came to him
because they knew he was going


145
0:5:58,24 --> 0:6:4,98
to be the bodyguard, the big
brother, just the whole


146
0:6:4,98 --> 0:6:7,38
Embarcadero regulator.


147
0:6:7,38 --> 0:6:10,77
I can remember something
going down.


148
0:6:10,77 --> 0:6:14,19
My buddy was trying to
sell some weed, got


149
0:6:14,19 --> 0:6:15,57
punched in the face.


150
0:6:15,57 --> 0:6:19,49
And I ran to get James like
I was getting the fucking


151
0:6:19,49 --> 0:6:20,84
cavalry, you know?


152
0:6:20,84 --> 0:6:33,68



153
0:6:33,68 --> 0:6:35,24
PATRICK O'DELL: Tell me
about stealing boards.


154
0:6:35,24 --> 0:6:36,74
I've heard rumors of that.


155
0:6:36,74 --> 0:6:38,37
JAMES KELCH: If you came through
and it was one of them


156
0:6:38,37 --> 0:6:40,34
hectic winters and no
one had a new board.


157
0:6:40,34 --> 0:6:42,362
And you had all brand new shit,
and you just got out of


158
0:6:42,362 --> 0:6:43,66
your mom's Lexus or whatnot.


159
0:6:43,66 --> 0:6:45,12
Yeah, you're probably going
to get your board stolen.


160
0:6:45,12 --> 0:6:47,9
It's the same as if you wear a
big ass huge gold chain and go


161
0:6:47,9 --> 0:6:48,75
hang out in Oakland
real quick.


162
0:6:48,75 --> 0:6:50,41
I mean nothing's different.


163
0:6:50,41 --> 0:6:51,92
Everyone thinks oh, just because
they were skaters.


164
0:6:51,92 --> 0:6:53,91
We were still just city kids.


165
0:6:53,91 --> 0:6:56,98
But it wasn't an everyday crazy
out of hand, you go


166
0:6:56,98 --> 0:6:58,12
there, you get your
board stolen.


167
0:6:58,12 --> 0:6:59,89
It gets exaggerated
way out of hand.


168
0:6:59,89 --> 0:7:3,4
SAM SMYTH: I mean, he's always
been that personality, man.


169
0:7:3,4 --> 0:7:8,26
Cool as the Fonz, young
Burt Reynolds face.


170
0:7:8,26 --> 0:7:13,0
He always had that charisma,
ever since he was young.


171
0:7:13,0 --> 0:7:15,314
I guess when you got
it, you got it.


172
0:7:15,314 --> 0:7:16,79
-This is James' car.


173
0:7:16,79 --> 0:7:21,531



174
0:7:21,531 --> 0:7:22,998
Here goes the front panel.


175
0:7:22,998 --> 0:7:25,932



176
0:7:25,932 --> 0:7:28,26
Let me see what I can do
with this wheel here.


177
0:7:28,26 --> 0:7:29,18
Hey, let's see if
we can start it!


178
0:7:29,18 --> 0:7:30,43
Look out, everybody,
it might blow up!


179
0:7:30,43 --> 0:7:33,68



180
0:7:33,68 --> 0:7:34,95
-What's the scene
with this car?


181
0:7:34,95 --> 0:7:36,24
Why's it all fucked up, dude?


182
0:7:36,24 --> 0:7:38,62
-Because fucking dumb ass Billy
took it and ruined it,


183
0:7:38,62 --> 0:7:40,13
and him and Jeff and Dune.


184
0:7:40,13 --> 0:7:44,82



185
0:7:44,82 --> 0:7:48,86
JAMES KELCH: Come on,
P. Out of the way,


186
0:7:48,86 --> 0:7:50,11
Gotto, we got company.


187
0:7:50,11 --> 0:7:53,13



188
0:7:53,13 --> 0:7:53,65
[INAUDIBLE]


189
0:7:53,65 --> 0:7:57,99
blah, blah, blah, I swear I seen
it just lying right here.


190
0:7:57,99 --> 0:7:59,17
Yeah, film the whole shit.


191
0:7:59,17 --> 0:8:3,7
This is the real life,
no Ferraris, no


192
0:8:3,7 --> 0:8:7,532
motorcycles, no nothing.


193
0:8:7,532 --> 0:8:10,4
PATRICK O'DELL: So when this
video came out, what year was


194
0:8:10,4 --> 0:8:11,5
this video made?


195
0:8:11,5 --> 0:8:13,142
JAMES KELCH: The video
came out in '93.


196
0:8:13,142 --> 0:8:15,62
PATRICK O'DELL: When the real
video was made you were


197
0:8:15,62 --> 0:8:16,6
already pro?


198
0:8:16,6 --> 0:8:17,435
JAMES KELCH: Yeah.


199
0:8:17,435 --> 0:8:19,26
PATRICK O'DELL: How did
you first get on Real?


200
0:8:19,26 --> 0:8:20,97
JAMES KELCH: I had knew Jim
Thebo and he was giving me


201
0:8:20,97 --> 0:8:22,46
wheels every once in awhile.


202
0:8:22,46 --> 0:8:29,107
And then one day I seen him
and Givanti and a bunch of


203
0:8:29,107 --> 0:8:31,13
heads skating brown
model benches.


204
0:8:31,13 --> 0:8:33,12
I just started skating the
benches like a maniac, man,


205
0:8:33,12 --> 0:8:34,169
just trying to show off.


206
0:8:34,169 --> 0:8:36,179
And then Thebo called me that
night and was like look, I


207
0:8:36,179 --> 0:8:37,179
can't do pressure flips.


208
0:8:37,179 --> 0:8:38,28
And it was a joke, of course.


209
0:8:38,28 --> 0:8:39,36
And I was like, yeah,
me neither, really.


210
0:8:39,36 --> 0:8:40,5
And he was like well,
we need a new pro.


211
0:8:40,5 --> 0:8:41,179
You want to skate for us?


212
0:8:41,179 --> 0:8:42,12
And I was like, yes,
of course.


213
0:8:42,12 --> 0:8:43,98
PATRICK O'DELL: So he just
saw you skate one time?


214
0:8:43,98 --> 0:8:44,72
JAMES KELCH: Oh, no.


215
0:8:44,72 --> 0:8:47,355
He had seen me skate a million
times, but I hadn't seen him


216
0:8:47,355 --> 0:8:48,21
in a while.


217
0:8:48,21 --> 0:8:51,26
I was AN for other companies
before I got on Real.


218
0:8:51,26 --> 0:8:55,3
Like Dogtown, H-Street, 101
for a little bit, rode for


219
0:8:55,3 --> 0:8:57,44
Plan B for a little while.


220
0:8:57,44 --> 0:8:58,73
I watched this video
the other day.


221
0:8:58,73 --> 0:9:0,55
It's pretty gnarly that
we even put a


222
0:9:0,55 --> 0:9:1,5
video out like that.


223
0:9:1,5 --> 0:9:2,865
Yeah, that's that girl, Molly.


224
0:9:2,865 --> 0:9:5,42



225
0:9:5,42 --> 0:9:7,9
Every time I [INAUDIBLE], she
always something to say.


226
0:9:7,9 --> 0:9:10,39
That bitch, blah, blah, blah.


227
0:9:10,39 --> 0:9:12,0
PATRICK O'DELL: They're
doing the wave?


228
0:9:12,0 --> 0:9:15,26
JAMES KELCH: Yeah, they
were doing the wave.


229
0:9:15,26 --> 0:9:16,52
I'm a gymnast.


230
0:9:16,52 --> 0:9:18,41
Ollie [INAUDIBLE] flip, the
only time I ever did it


231
0:9:18,41 --> 0:9:20,68
outside of a skate park,
I had no wheels.


232
0:9:20,68 --> 0:9:24,138
I was just rolling on bearings
right there.


233
0:9:24,138 --> 0:9:27,7
I was actually really proud
of that [INAUDIBLE].


234
0:9:27,7 --> 0:9:29,62
It always used to
feel real good.


235
0:9:29,62 --> 0:9:31,24
I was actually pleased I
even worked a part out.


236
0:9:31,24 --> 0:9:33,13
I wasn't even barely skating
when we filmed all this shit.


237
0:9:33,13 --> 0:9:35,196
When they came to me and were
like oh, the video's done, I


238
0:9:35,196 --> 0:9:36,89
was like but hold on,
I didn't even film.


239
0:9:36,89 --> 0:9:37,96
PATRICK O'DELL: You
weren't skating a


240
0:9:37,96 --> 0:9:38,81
lot because of drugs?


241
0:9:38,81 --> 0:9:40,69
JAMES KELCH: Actually, no.


242
0:9:40,69 --> 0:9:41,99
It was mostly injuries
at first.


243
0:9:41,99 --> 0:9:44,19
And then the drugs came with me
just sitting around doing


244
0:9:44,19 --> 0:9:45,43
nothing because of my ankles.


245
0:9:45,43 --> 0:9:47,44
Because I had childhood
arthritis growing up,


246
0:9:47,44 --> 0:9:48,225
rheumatoid arthritis.


247
0:9:48,225 --> 0:9:51,56
And so I got all these
crushed-up, clicking bones and


248
0:9:51,56 --> 0:9:53,615
all this bullshit, and I just
would go around it.


249
0:9:53,615 --> 0:9:55,37
And then it started getting
worse and worse until


250
0:9:55,37 --> 0:9:56,96
eventually I was just,
I'm not even going to


251
0:9:56,96 --> 0:9:58,6
try to skate anymore.


252
0:9:58,6 --> 0:10:1,48
But then I was still pro, and
doing drugs, trying to skate


253
0:10:1,48 --> 0:10:2,19
here and there.


254
0:10:2,19 --> 0:10:4,71
Dude, I would be just standing
there all drugged out and Jim


255
0:10:4,71 --> 0:10:5,72
would just be like
do something.


256
0:10:5,72 --> 0:10:7,465
I'd be like just tell
me what to do, man.


257
0:10:7,465 --> 0:10:9,4
They he would just bring
up a random trick he


258
0:10:9,4 --> 0:10:10,2
saw me do one time.


259
0:10:10,2 --> 0:10:10,76
I'd be like all right.


260
0:10:10,76 --> 0:10:11,38
PATRICK O'DELL: Who
filmed it, Maza?


261
0:10:11,38 --> 0:10:14,43
JAMES KELCH: Most of the real
video was filmed by, I would


262
0:10:14,43 --> 0:10:16,11
go with Thebo.


263
0:10:16,11 --> 0:10:17,72
Because he knew if it
wasn't him, that I


264
0:10:17,72 --> 0:10:18,48
wouldn't even come out.


265
0:10:18,48 --> 0:10:20,7
Like, all those other dudes
would show up to get me and I


266
0:10:20,7 --> 0:10:20,795
wouldn't even go outside.


267
0:10:20,795 --> 0:10:21,57
I'd be like, well, fuck off.


268
0:10:21,57 --> 0:10:24,34
But then Jim would come and
I'd have to get up.


269
0:10:24,34 --> 0:10:25,66
I'd be like all right,
Jim, let's go.


270
0:10:25,66 --> 0:10:29,345
He'd put me the shower
and said come on.


271
0:10:29,345 --> 0:10:31,81
It's very, very weird
when I watch it.


272
0:10:31,81 --> 0:10:33,59
A lot of those tricks, toes are


273
0:10:33,59 --> 0:10:35,42
dragging, no one's rolling.


274
0:10:35,42 --> 0:10:36,87
You might as well just
stop and pick your


275
0:10:36,87 --> 0:10:38,2
board up and walk away.


276
0:10:38,2 --> 0:10:39,62
Except for Solomon's part.


277
0:10:39,62 --> 0:10:41,6
All I know is I was chilling on
Oak Street one day at the


278
0:10:41,6 --> 0:10:42,155
party palace.


279
0:10:42,155 --> 0:10:43,99
And there's a knock at the door
like 7:00 in the morning.


280
0:10:43,99 --> 0:10:45,4
I open it, it's like Gonzo.


281
0:10:45,4 --> 0:10:47,2
He's like dude, I just saw
your part, I love it.


282
0:10:47,2 --> 0:10:48,2
It's one of my favorites.


283
0:10:48,2 --> 0:10:50,37
You want to go skate?


284
0:10:50,37 --> 0:10:52,46
I was like oh, I didn't go to
sleep all night and I kind of


285
0:10:52,46 --> 0:10:53,6
just shut the door
in his face.


286
0:10:53,6 --> 0:10:54,6
PATRICK O'DELL: On Gonz?


287
0:10:54,6 --> 0:10:56,31
JAMES KELCH: Yeah, I just
went back in the house.


288
0:10:56,31 --> 0:10:57,82
I was too embarrassed to
hang out with him.


289
0:10:57,82 --> 0:10:59,8
I was up all night
doing drugs.


290
0:10:59,8 --> 0:11:3,63
I didn't want to hangout with
Gonzo, he's like my idol.


291
0:11:3,63 --> 0:11:5,745
As you could tell, the house is
a tad bit cluttered so it


292
0:11:5,745 --> 0:11:8,2
took me a while to find it.


293
0:11:8,2 --> 0:11:9,78
My girl put this
shit together.


294
0:11:9,78 --> 0:11:11,27
I don't know if that plastic's
going to be


295
0:11:11,27 --> 0:11:12,9
reflecting on you or not.


296
0:11:12,9 --> 0:11:15,34
This one, this is how
skateboarding actually works.


297
0:11:15,34 --> 0:11:18,58
Whether they, not now maybe, but
I know these guys always


298
0:11:18,58 --> 0:11:20,42
cared about me and everything,
but listen to this story.


299
0:11:20,42 --> 0:11:22,6
It's a light brown coat,
and you see all the


300
0:11:22,6 --> 0:11:22,96
dark spots on it?


301
0:11:22,96 --> 0:11:26,1
That's all blood, and spray
matter, and people bleeding


302
0:11:26,1 --> 0:11:26,73
and shit like that.


303
0:11:26,73 --> 0:11:28,9
Well, I got into a big bar fight
with these bikers and I


304
0:11:28,9 --> 0:11:29,85
just beat their faces in.


305
0:11:29,85 --> 0:11:31,3
They beat me up, too,
as you can tell.


306
0:11:31,3 --> 0:11:33,19
So the next day I go down to
the Deluxe to get maybe


307
0:11:33,19 --> 0:11:35,65
cleaned up, some money, see if
my eye's all right, it's all


308
0:11:35,65 --> 0:11:37,21
swollen, and get some
clothes or whatnot.


309
0:11:37,21 --> 0:11:39,36
But instead as soon as I walked
in, no one cared about


310
0:11:39,36 --> 0:11:39,59
any of that.


311
0:11:39,59 --> 0:11:42,78
They were like dude, just
go take pictures.


312
0:11:42,78 --> 0:11:45,24
I couldn't walk, nothing, I
couldn't get no new clothes.


313
0:11:45,24 --> 0:11:46,805
They were like, you got to
get photos of this shit.


314
0:11:46,805 --> 0:11:49,24
They just drug me out to these
abandoned projects behind Real


315
0:11:49,24 --> 0:11:49,66
and took this photo.


316
0:11:49,66 --> 0:11:52,54
PATRICK O'DELL: How much longer
did you write for Real


317
0:11:52,54 --> 0:11:52,935
after this?


318
0:11:52,935 --> 0:11:54,32
JAMES KELCH: After the
video came out?


319
0:11:54,32 --> 0:11:59,8
So if the video came out '93,
'94 I moved to [INAUDIBLE] and


320
0:11:59,8 --> 0:12:0,91
lived with Kelly Bird
and Diedrich.


321
0:12:0,91 --> 0:12:4,16
And then we were going to go on
tour, so I came to Ohio to


322
0:12:4,16 --> 0:12:5,6
hang out for a little bit.


323
0:12:5,6 --> 0:12:8,76
Went on the tour, left early,
they wrecked the van.


324
0:12:8,76 --> 0:12:11,43
So I'm figuring right before '95
started they called me and


325
0:12:11,43 --> 0:12:13,0
asked me if I was skating
and all that shit.


326
0:12:13,0 --> 0:12:15,4
And I didn't like the tone
of whoever's voice


327
0:12:15,4 --> 0:12:15,68
I was talking to.


328
0:12:15,68 --> 0:12:17,38
So I told them no, I don't
skate no more, I quit.


329
0:12:17,38 --> 0:12:18,29
PATRICK O'DELL: You were
talking to Tommy?


330
0:12:18,29 --> 0:12:19,8
JAMES KELCH: It was
Tommy, yeah.


331
0:12:19,8 --> 0:12:21,6
He wasn't being a dick or
nothing, but I could tell he


332
0:12:21,6 --> 0:12:22,0
wasn't happy with me.


333
0:12:22,0 --> 0:12:24,29
PATRICK O'DELL: Here's a photo
I took, it was really bad.


334
0:12:24,29 --> 0:12:24,78
Sorry.


335
0:12:24,78 --> 0:12:26,67
JAMES KELCH: It is the
photo you took.


336
0:12:26,67 --> 0:12:29,94
I remember that day.


337
0:12:29,94 --> 0:12:32,56
Those are some tight pants
on my butt, man.


338
0:12:32,56 --> 0:12:32,82
Gross.


339
0:12:32,82 --> 0:12:34,7
You should have told me.


340
0:12:34,7 --> 0:12:36,55
PATRICK O'DELL: No,
I'm not retiring?


341
0:12:36,55 --> 0:12:38,75
JAMES KELCH: Yeah, this is an ad
I got like a month after I


342
0:12:38,75 --> 0:12:40,3
told Real I was retiring.


343
0:12:40,3 --> 0:12:42,52
PATRICK O'DELL: Who is God?


344
0:12:42,52 --> 0:12:44,47
JAMES KELCH: Yeah, I got in
"Big Brother" one time.


345
0:12:44,47 --> 0:12:45,9
It was the "Who is God" thing.


346
0:12:45,9 --> 0:12:48,8
They asked me a question, what
do I think about God, and took


347
0:12:48,8 --> 0:12:49,0
a picture of me doing
a smith grind.


348
0:12:49,0 --> 0:12:50,26
PATRICK O'DELL: What's
you say?


349
0:12:50,26 --> 0:12:52,2
JAMES KELCH: I said, here,
want me to read it?


350
0:12:52,2 --> 0:12:54,15
I don't even remember.


351
0:12:54,15 --> 0:12:56,4
"I believe in religion because
I believe there's a greater


352
0:12:56,4 --> 0:12:57,5
force than ours.


353
0:12:57,5 --> 0:12:59,58
I think when people die their
souls leave to some spiritual


354
0:12:59,58 --> 0:13:0,71
place, whether that's
good or bad.


355
0:13:0,71 --> 0:13:2,73
I'm not religious, because the
way people go about their


356
0:13:2,73 --> 0:13:3,6
religions is weird.


357
0:13:3,6 --> 0:13:5,63
I don't tend to judge
others' religions,


358
0:13:5,63 --> 0:13:7,2
because I don't care.


359
0:13:7,2 --> 0:13:8,14
The world's really
a better place


360
0:13:8,14 --> 0:13:9,2
when people are religious.


361
0:13:9,2 --> 0:13:10,14
It keeps a lot of people nice.


362
0:13:10,14 --> 0:13:12,75
It changes psychos into somewhat
normal peoples.


363
0:13:12,75 --> 0:13:14,91
I think most of the Earth is
evil, because this is Satan's


364
0:13:14,91 --> 0:13:16,98
land to do with as he pleases.


365
0:13:16,98 --> 0:13:18,39
Most good things must
be somewhere else.


366
0:13:18,39 --> 0:13:20,3
The only way religion has
affected my life is when it's


367
0:13:20,3 --> 0:13:22,632
helped change some of my friends
into better people."


368
0:13:22,632 --> 0:13:25,6
And that's that.


369
0:13:25,6 --> 0:13:27,83
I'm going to give a Solomon
secret out real quick.


370
0:13:27,83 --> 0:13:30,16
You know for like a year and a
half, almost two years, he


371
0:13:30,16 --> 0:13:32,2
used to skate the other way?


372
0:13:32,2 --> 0:13:32,985
And then he pushed mongo.


373
0:13:32,985 --> 0:13:33,915
PATRICK O'DELL: What
do you mean?


374
0:13:33,915 --> 0:13:36,85
JAMES KELCH: He skated
goofy-footed


375
0:13:36,85 --> 0:13:38,31
and he pushed mongo.


376
0:13:38,31 --> 0:13:40,65
And people told him like
yo, you're whack.


377
0:13:40,65 --> 0:13:42,11
Unless I'm just making
it all up.


378
0:13:42,11 --> 0:13:43,1
You never know, my
brain's confused.


379
0:13:43,1 --> 0:13:44,53
But I remember all
the stories.


380
0:13:44,53 --> 0:13:46,64
Yeah, dude skated goofy-footed
and pushed mongo, and they


381
0:13:46,64 --> 0:13:48,1
told him yo, you're a bum.


382
0:13:48,1 --> 0:15:48,1
