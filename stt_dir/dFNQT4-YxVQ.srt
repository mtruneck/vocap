0:0:9,23 --> 0:0:15,889
SECRETARY KERRY: Well, it's my pleasure to
follow the comedian from New Zealand. (Laughter.)


2
0:0:15,889 --> 0:0:21,579
I'm happy to follow two guys who speak kind
of funny. (Laughter.)


3
0:0:21,579 --> 0:0:26,589
What a pleasure to be here with Ambassador
Mike Moore, former prime minister, who is


4
0:0:26,589 --> 0:0:34,36
a great person and a terrific leader. And
I am so grateful to him for the leadership


5
0:0:34,36 --> 0:0:40,55
of New Zealand, a country I've had a chance
to visit several times beginning way back


6
0:0:40,55 --> 0:0:47,3
when I was in the United States Navy; and
also my friend Bob Carr, and thank you, Mr.


7
0:0:47,3 --> 0:0:51,829
Minister, for being here with us. I told him
today I have not yet been lucky enough to


8
0:0:51,829 --> 0:0:59,23
get down under, but I am sure to get there
very, very soon and I look forward to it.


9
0:0:59,23 --> 0:1:5,179
Really privileged to have these two gentlemen
supporting this endeavor, and I'm particularly


10
0:1:5,179 --> 0:1:10,86
grateful to the Pew Charitable Trust and to
National Geographic. Terry, thank you so much


11
0:1:10,86 --> 0:1:18,56
for making this available tonight. Everybody's
favorite magazine; I think we all grew up


12
0:1:18,56 --> 0:1:26,13
with it and it just stays extraordinary. And
tonight you'll share in a film which will


13
0:1:26,13 --> 0:1:32,7
really underscore the importance of everything
that that magazine tries to impart to all


14
0:1:32,7 --> 0:1:39,869
of us and has stood for all of these years.


15
0:1:39,869 --> 0:1:47,9
I am a child of the ocean in many ways. From
the first moment when I was a kid up at Cape


16
0:1:47,9 --> 0:1:55,31
Cod dipping my toes into Buzzards Bay looking
for clams, literally a three or four year-old


17
0:1:55,31 --> 0:2:1,539
being shown the wonders of the ocean, shrimping
and other things, to a time when we used to


18
0:2:1,539 --> 0:2:9,989
gather mussels in the evening and an hour
later cook them and enjoy an incredible meal.


19
0:2:9,989 --> 0:2:15,87
Today, very difficult to find mussels anywhere
in that area.


20
0:2:15,87 --> 0:2:22,79
So I've watched the transition. I've seen
it. As a senator I was privileged to bring


21
0:2:22,79 --> 0:2:30,549
efforts before the United Nations with Ted
Stevens to end driftnet fishing, and also


22
0:2:30,549 --> 0:2:36,459
to try to work hard to preserve through a
number of fisheries bills - I think I rewrote


23
0:2:36,459 --> 0:2:42,34
the Magnuson Fisheries Act at least three
or four times - as we tried to get the balance


24
0:2:42,34 --> 0:2:45,62
right and protect our fisheries.


25
0:2:45,62 --> 0:2:53,43
I've seen the struggle with respect to invasive
species and I have seen this fragile ecosystem


26
0:2:53,43 --> 0:3:0,81
change before our very eyes, whether it's
a problem of acidification, a problem of pollution


27
0:3:0,81 --> 0:3:8,549
and development, a problem of ice melt and
potential ecosystem collapse, to the rise


28
0:3:8,549 --> 0:3:14,15
of the sea levels, which is happening in various
parts of the world more so than elsewhere,


29
0:3:14,15 --> 0:3:21,37
to the overfishing that takes place in almost
every single fishery on the face of the planet.


30
0:3:21,37 --> 0:3:28,15
We call this beautiful planet that we are
privileged to inhabit for a short period of


31
0:3:28,15 --> 0:3:35,389
time, we call it Earth, but it could well
have been called Ocean because three-quarters


32
0:3:35,389 --> 0:3:43,1
of it is ocean. And the oceans are responsible
in many ways for life because of the cycle


33
0:3:43,1 --> 0:3:49,769
of rain and humidity and all of the protein
and life that comes from the ocean. So we


34
0:3:49,769 --> 0:3:58,6
can't be casual about it. We can't be casual
about it. And it is clear that we have an


35
0:3:58,6 --> 0:4:7,49
enormous challenge ahead of us as we face
the extraordinary excess that we see with


36
0:4:7,49 --> 0:4:12,879
respect to each of those issues that I talked
about: energy policy that results in acidification,


37
0:4:12,879 --> 0:4:17,32
the bleaching of coral, the destruction of
species, the change in the Arctic because


38
0:4:17,32 --> 0:4:23,79
of the ice melt, and the change in the krill,
the population of whales. The entire system


39
0:4:23,79 --> 0:4:30,2
is interdependent, and we toy with that at
our peril.


40
0:4:30,2 --> 0:4:36,72
So it is vital that we've come to this moment
where we begin to see that this is not just


41
0:4:36,72 --> 0:4:43,51
an environmental issue. This is a security
issue. It's an economic security issue. It's


42
0:4:43,51 --> 0:4:53,81
a national security issue. And it is in many
ways a challenge with respect to energy security


43
0:4:53,81 --> 0:5:2,48
and our approach to energy policy, and ultimately
it is a challenge to our commitment to science


44
0:5:2,48 --> 0:5:11,82
and facts and ultimately our basic sense of
faith and what we believe in and our responsibility


45
0:5:11,82 --> 0:5:14,72
as human beings on this planet.


46
0:5:14,72 --> 0:5:24,2
So climate change is coming back in a sense
as a serious international issue because people


47
0:5:24,2 --> 0:5:32,72
are experiencing it firsthand. The science
is screaming at us, literally, demanding that


48
0:5:32,72 --> 0:5:39,6
people in positions of public responsibility
at least exercise the so-called "precautionary


49
0:5:39,6 --> 0:5:46,4
principle" to balance the equities and not
knowing completely the outcomes at least understand


50
0:5:46,4 --> 0:5:53,51
what is happening and take steps to prevent
potential disaster. I've often said to people,


51
0:5:53,51 --> 0:5:59,32
"What is the worst that could happen to you
if you make a decision to put good energy


52
0:5:59,32 --> 0:6:3,54
policy in place and respond to what the science
and the facts are telling us?" Well, the worst


53
0:6:3,54 --> 0:6:7,81
that can happen to you if you would employ
a lot of people in alternative and renewable


54
0:6:7,81 --> 0:6:15,41
and clean energy; you would have less hospitalizations,
cleaner air, more children with less asthma;


55
0:6:15,41 --> 0:6:22,4
and you would create an enormous number of
jobs by moving to those new energy possibilities


56
0:6:22,4 --> 0:6:27,94
and policies and infrastructure. That's the
worst that can happen to you.


57
0:6:27,94 --> 0:6:34,3
What if the other people are wrong and we
are right; what's the worst that can happen?


58
0:6:34,3 --> 0:6:41,22
The destruction of the ecosystem as we live
with it today. So that's really what's on


59
0:6:41,22 --> 0:6:48,74
the line, and I'm here to tell you that, proudly,
President Obama has put this agenda back on


60
0:6:48,74 --> 0:6:53,69
the front burner where it belongs, that he
has in his Inauguration Address and in his


61
0:6:53,69 --> 0:6:59,47
State of the Union Address and in the policies
he's working on now said we are going to try


62
0:6:59,47 --> 0:7:3,44
to exercise leadership because of its imperatives.


63
0:7:3,44 --> 0:7:10,78
So I want to thank the Pew Foundation and
National Geographic for joining in this imperative.


64
0:7:10,78 --> 0:7:16,78
We need to try to pass the Law of the Sea.
We attempted to do that earlier and we will


65
0:7:16,78 --> 0:7:22,69
continue to try to press for that. But most
important when it comes to the Ross Sea and


66
0:7:22,69 --> 0:7:28,55
Antarctica, we're not going to wait for a
crisis before we take action. I think we're


67
0:7:28,55 --> 0:7:33,64
making a smart choice now. We're proud to
join with New Zealand and Australia, two countries


68
0:7:33,64 --> 0:7:38,25
that have an extraordinary understanding of
the sea and commitment to protecting it and


69
0:7:38,25 --> 0:7:40,53
who have been great stewards.


70
0:7:40,53 --> 0:7:46,98
The Ross Sea, as we heard from Karen earlier,
is a natural laboratory. And we disrespect


71
0:7:46,98 --> 0:7:53,5
it at our peril, as we do the rest of the
ocean. The environment there is so extreme,


72
0:7:53,5 --> 0:7:59,37
as we know, that it's difficult to live as
a penguin or a killer whale or a seal, but


73
0:7:59,37 --> 0:8:5,94
they've adapted. And in their adaptation,
we've learned what a remarkably diverse and


74
0:8:5,94 --> 0:8:12,26
productive ecosystem it is. We've learned
from the scientists who go down there at McMurdo


75
0:8:12,26 --> 0:8:16,58
Station and spend those critical months trying
to research it and understand it.


76
0:8:16,58 --> 0:8:21,33
Now, you've probably never asked a waiter
- any of you - for a nice Antarctic tooth


77
0:8:21,33 --> 0:8:28,1
fish, I suspect. You're probably more used
to ordering it as a Chilean sea bass. But


78
0:8:28,1 --> 0:8:33,51
American researchers working in the Ross Sea
have actually discovered that the tooth fish


79
0:8:33,51 --> 0:8:42,289
produces a special antifreeze protein, and
whenever ice crystals form in the fish's cells,


80
0:8:42,289 --> 0:8:49,509
these proteins latch onto them and actually
ferry the ice out of the body. That discovery


81
0:8:49,509 --> 0:8:55,319
has launched a whole new scientific field
of structural biology, and it's helping us


82
0:8:55,319 --> 0:9:2,589
to think now about other adaptations to extreme
environment in new ways. It also has commercial


83
0:9:2,589 --> 0:9:8,73
applications. Think about perhaps fluffier
bread or ice cream that stays frozen without


84
0:9:8,73 --> 0:9:13,43
ice crystals in it. These are real possibilities.


85
0:9:13,43 --> 0:9:17,41
Another group of researchers from my home
state of Massachusetts have done remarkable


86
0:9:17,41 --> 0:9:24,889
work studying the physiology of seals as they
dive in the Ross Sea. And they've actually


87
0:9:24,889 --> 0:9:32,67
learned - they've helped unlock our understanding
of hypoxia, which is a condition that develops


88
0:9:32,67 --> 0:9:37,73
when the body is deprived of oxygen. As a
result of that, they have actually developed


89
0:9:37,73 --> 0:9:48,31
a treatment that has dealt with hypoxic newborns
and saved more than 10,000 babies a year.


90
0:9:48,31 --> 0:9:52,85
That's what we can learn, as well as many,
many other things that we could talk about.


91
0:9:52,85 --> 0:10:1,11
So imagine the possibilities of these discoveries
that await us if we can encourage our innovators


92
0:10:1,11 --> 0:10:6,329
and our inventors to put our shoulder to the
wheel and have the maximum preservation of


93
0:10:6,329 --> 0:10:9,149
the opportunity of that laboratory.


94
0:10:9,149 --> 0:10:14,559
That's why it is so important for the Commission
for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living


95
0:10:14,559 --> 0:10:21,559
Resources to approve our proposals to establish
this Marine Protected Area - and you've heard


96
0:10:21,559 --> 0:10:30,11
all the comparisons from Ambassador Mike Moore
about roughly the size of this, that, several


97
0:10:30,11 --> 0:10:37,319
Californias, Alaska. It's extraordinary. It
will be quite simply the largest protected


98
0:10:37,319 --> 0:10:38,779
area in the world.


99
0:10:38,779 --> 0:10:44,129
Now, I know the value of that, and the reason
I know the value of that is I was the author


100
0:10:44,129 --> 0:10:50,499
in the Senate of the Marine Sanctuary called
Stellwagen Bank off our cape. And we have


101
0:10:50,499 --> 0:10:55,809
seen what that preservation has been able
to do. Imagine what this would do as a baseline


102
0:10:55,809 --> 0:11:3,74
study for what happens to the species that
assemble in that area as we preserve a component


103
0:11:3,74 --> 0:11:10,639
of it as a managed fishery and the rest of
it as a baseline laboratory for all of this


104
0:11:10,639 --> 0:11:11,509
research.


105
0:11:11,509 --> 0:11:16,569
We also support the important proposal of
Australia, the EU, and France that they have


106
0:11:16,569 --> 0:11:20,55
developed for protection of East Antarctica.


107
0:11:20,55 --> 0:11:28,269
So my friends, I'd just summarize by saying
this to you: Antarctica is a collection of


108
0:11:28,269 --> 0:11:35,48
superlatives. It is the highest, the coldest,
the windiest, the driest, the most pristine,


109
0:11:35,48 --> 0:11:43,889
and the most remote place on Earth. And it
has beguiled humankind for centuries as people


110
0:11:43,889 --> 0:11:50,11
have sought to understand it. Starting in
the 1700s, explorers struggled to chart its


111
0:11:50,11 --> 0:11:57,9
contours and to cross its desolation without
any guarantee ever of a safe return. And still


112
0:11:57,9 --> 0:12:3,379
today, curiosity and sheer doggedness are
what draw people from all around the world


113
0:12:3,379 --> 0:12:6,689
to explore its southernmost shore.


114
0:12:6,689 --> 0:12:15,529
So we signed the Antarctic Treaty in 1959.
For those who doubt the benefit of treaties,


115
0:12:15,529 --> 0:12:21,35
go look at what we have achieved there, not
to mention so many others. The world has shown


116
0:12:21,35 --> 0:12:29,4
that we can work together to ensure that Antarctica
remains a place devoted to peace and devoted


117
0:12:29,4 --> 0:12:34,569
to expanding the human understanding of this
fragile planet that we live on. This is one


118
0:12:34,569 --> 0:12:40,55
of the last places we could do this, and I
think we owe it to ourselves to make it happen.


119
0:12:40,55 --> 0:12:45,23
So I thank you for coming here tonight. I
noticed coming in here there were a number


120
0:12:45,23 --> 0:12:50,69
of empty wine glasses on the tables, so I
know you didn't waste your time completely


121
0:12:50,69 --> 0:12:56,139
before I got here. (Laughter.) But I hope
this movie will inspire you. I hope the support


122
0:12:56,139 --> 0:13:4,19
of our wonderful friends who understand the
ocean as well as any people on this planet


123
0:13:4,19 --> 0:13:8,72
and who have worked to preserve it, I hope
that will inspire all of you to connect to


124
0:13:8,72 --> 0:13:15,66
the rest of America and the rest of the world
to apply our human responsibility during this


125
0:13:15,66 --> 0:13:19,379
time of stewardship that we have on this fragile
planet.


126
0:13:19,379 --> 0:13:22,499
Thank you for being here tonight. Thank you
most of all for what you're going to do. I'd


127
0:13:22,499 --> 0:13:34,91
just remind you, in the 1970s there wasn't
really an environment movement in America.


128
0:13:34,91 --> 0:13:41,43
We didn't have an EPA. Just think of that.
We had no EPA. And it wasn't until Rachel


129
0:13:41,43 --> 0:13:47,809
Carson wrote her Silent Spring and inspired
people to become activists that people became


130
0:13:47,809 --> 0:13:56,999
aware of Love Canal and Woburn dump and places
which give people cancer and kill citizens.


131
0:13:56,999 --> 0:14:0,629
And all of a sudden, people decided we don't
want to live next to these places, we think


132
0:14:0,629 --> 0:14:5,929
there's a different choice. And 20 million
people came out of their homes on one single


133
0:14:5,929 --> 0:14:13,48
day. April 21st, 1970 was the first Earth
Day. And those 20 million people didn't stop


134
0:14:13,48 --> 0:14:20,74
on that day. They translated that day's action
into political action. They targeted the 12


135
0:14:20,74 --> 0:14:26,929
worst votes in the United States Congress,
labeled them the Dirty Dozen, and kicked seven


136
0:14:26,929 --> 0:14:34,149
of them out of Congress in the 1972 election.
You know what happened? It unleashed a torrent


137
0:14:34,149 --> 0:14:39,24
of activity so that we passed the Clean Air
Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, Marine Mammal


138
0:14:39,24 --> 0:14:44,559
Protection Act, Coastal Zone Management Act,
Safe Drinking Water Act, and even created


139
0:14:44,559 --> 0:14:52,569
the EPA, which Richard Nixon, whose idea it
was not, signed it into law. (Laughter and


140
0:14:52,569 --> 0:14:53,279
applause.)


141
0:14:53,279 --> 0:15:0,29
So folks, that's what being here is all about.
That's what tonight's inspiration is all about.


142
0:15:0,29 --> 0:15:5,69
We can change everybody's attitude about this
because it matters to all of us. Thank you


143
0:15:5,69 --> 0:17:5,69
and God bless. (Applause.)
