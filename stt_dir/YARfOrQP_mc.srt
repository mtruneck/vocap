1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:0,415



2
0:0:0,415 --> 0:0:1,77
HARMONY KORINE: All right, so
we're going to look at some


3
0:0:1,77 --> 0:0:4,89
pictures today from the set
of Spring Breakers.


4
0:0:4,89 --> 0:0:6,15
Behind the scenes shit.


5
0:0:6,15 --> 0:0:13,14



6
0:0:13,14 --> 0:0:16,72
In between takes, the girls
would blast, like, pop music,


7
0:0:16,72 --> 0:0:19,71
and Drake and stuff,
and dance.


8
0:0:19,71 --> 0:0:22,35
They would be doing that mostly
to keep themselves up


9
0:0:22,35 --> 0:0:24,45
and keep themselves in character
and the momentum.


10
0:0:24,45 --> 0:0:27,33



11
0:0:27,33 --> 0:0:28,54
Selena's character
is a little more


12
0:0:28,54 --> 0:0:30,71
naive, and more religious.


13
0:0:30,71 --> 0:0:32,18
The other girls are
super hardcore.


14
0:0:32,18 --> 0:0:36,78



15
0:0:36,78 --> 0:0:39,96
I mostly knew her at that point
from just peripherally,


16
0:0:39,96 --> 0:0:42,57
and from her show on Disney.


17
0:0:42,57 --> 0:0:46,57
But it seems to have built over
the course of the making


18
0:0:46,57 --> 0:0:52,8
of this film into something
approaching mania.


19
0:0:52,8 --> 0:0:54,1
I think she was nervous to do
this sequence, because it


20
0:0:54,1 --> 0:0:56,53
required a lot of dudes
rubbing up on her.


21
0:0:56,53 --> 0:0:58,58
I don't think she'd ever
had that happen, so


22
0:0:58,58 --> 0:0:59,85
it was pretty intense.


23
0:0:59,85 --> 0:1:2,34
I remember there were a lot of
dudes wanting to hump her, but


24
0:1:2,34 --> 0:1:5,39
she was a trooper.


25
0:1:5,39 --> 0:1:8,2
Looks like Vanessa and
Ashley in ski masks.


26
0:1:8,2 --> 0:1:10,52
The pink ski masks with the
unicorn patches was their


27
0:1:10,52 --> 0:1:11,23
robbing mode.


28
0:1:11,23 --> 0:1:14,38
Kind of [INAUDIBLE] gangster.


29
0:1:14,38 --> 0:1:17,7
The real robbery scene, where
they're robbing tourists and


30
0:1:17,7 --> 0:1:19,48
stuff, they were pretty
amped up.


31
0:1:19,48 --> 0:1:22,6
I usually shoot the scene from
beginning to end, and just let


32
0:1:22,6 --> 0:1:23,94
them go through it
all in real time.


33
0:1:23,94 --> 0:1:26,67
And so it was really like
they were doing it.


34
0:1:26,67 --> 0:1:29,27



35
0:1:29,27 --> 0:1:30,98
This is the girls getting
arrested, the


36
0:1:30,98 --> 0:1:32,3
party at the motel.


37
0:1:32,3 --> 0:1:34,235
And this was hard, because there
was paparazzi around,


38
0:1:34,235 --> 0:1:35,51
and sometimes there would
be more people


39
0:1:35,51 --> 0:1:36,76
around than crew members.


40
0:1:36,76 --> 0:1:42,77



41
0:1:42,77 --> 0:1:44,65
There's Selena and Rachel.


42
0:1:44,65 --> 0:1:47,62
Rachel was kind of trying to
protect her, I think, in real


43
0:1:47,62 --> 0:1:51,11
life and it even just became a
character trait in the film.


44
0:1:51,11 --> 0:1:53,45
They kind of became
close friends.


45
0:1:53,45 --> 0:1:56,13
-[INAUDIBLE] miss something
out there.


46
0:1:56,13 --> 0:1:58,6
HARMONY KORINE: Selena is crying
in this sequence, and


47
0:1:58,6 --> 0:2:0,56
she was freaked out
in real life.


48
0:2:0,56 --> 0:2:2,94
I didn't tell her about what
was going to happen.


49
0:2:2,94 --> 0:2:5,83
This was something that I'd
been saving in my mind for


50
0:2:5,83 --> 0:2:7,62
about three or four
months before.


51
0:2:7,62 --> 0:2:9,59
I didn't want her to
be prepared for it.


52
0:2:9,59 --> 0:2:11,64
I didn't want her to be thinking
about it, so we just


53
0:2:11,64 --> 0:2:13,11
kind of threw it on her.


54
0:2:13,11 --> 0:2:16,3
And she was pretty freaked to
do the sequence, but I think


55
0:2:16,3 --> 0:2:17,57
it's her best scene
in the movie.


56
0:2:17,57 --> 0:4:17,57
