2
0:0:15,906 --> 0:0:17,81
JEFFREY BUSSOLINI: My name's
Jeffrey Bussolini.


3
0:0:17,81 --> 0:0:21,28
And by training, I'm a
sociologist and a philosopher.


4
0:0:21,28 --> 0:0:26,6
My main area of interest
is to study cats--


5
0:0:26,6 --> 0:0:30,13
feline-feline interactions and
feline-human interactions.


6
0:0:30,13 --> 0:0:32,119
Here's was one of my favorite
shirts here.


7
0:0:32,119 --> 0:0:34,3
This is probably my single
favorite shirt here.


8
0:0:34,3 --> 0:0:35,62
Hi.


9
0:0:35,62 --> 0:0:36,98
You're soft.


10
0:0:36,98 --> 0:0:40,2
I've lived with cats for a long
time-- since I was about


11
0:0:40,2 --> 0:0:42,5
10 or so or maybe 9.


12
0:0:42,5 --> 0:0:44,29
We've done our best in the
Center for Feline Studies to


13
0:0:44,29 --> 0:0:47,7
pay heed to the way that cats
interact with one another--


14
0:0:47,7 --> 0:0:49,44
the way that humans interact
with cats.


15
0:0:49,44 --> 0:0:52,4
And we spent a lot of time
meticulously observing and


16
0:0:52,4 --> 0:0:55,3
trying to make sense of some
of their behavior--


17
0:0:55,3 --> 0:0:58,52
some of their communication
repertoires.


18
0:0:58,52 --> 0:1:0,52
The other thing that I study--


19
0:1:0,52 --> 0:1:2,62
because I grew up in Los
Alamos, New Mexico--


20
0:1:2,62 --> 0:1:5,17
is the history of nuclear
weapons development.


21
0:1:5,17 --> 0:1:7,4
And one of my teachers told me,
you can't just be thinking


22
0:1:7,4 --> 0:1:8,64
about nuclear war
all the time.


23
0:1:8,64 --> 0:1:10,71
You've got to have something
else to occupy your thoughts


24
0:1:10,71 --> 0:1:14,25
that's less bleak-- that's
funnier and more engaging.


25
0:1:14,25 --> 0:1:17,978



26
0:1:17,978 --> 0:1:19,85
AMY KELLNER: I get
emails whenever


27
0:1:19,85 --> 0:1:21,53
there's a new Mario video.


28
0:1:21,53 --> 0:1:24,37
And as soon as I get one, I'm
like, stop everything.


29
0:1:24,37 --> 0:1:27,67
I need to see what
Mario's up to.


30
0:1:27,67 --> 0:1:28,67
It really is like a drug.


31
0:1:28,67 --> 0:1:30,66
It just makes you feel good.


32
0:1:30,66 --> 0:1:35,2
Just give me the cuteness
unadulterated.


33
0:1:35,2 --> 0:1:36,45
I don't want to hear anything.


34
0:1:36,45 --> 0:1:37,67
I don't want to see anything.


35
0:1:37,67 --> 0:1:41,53
I just want the cute stuff
concentrated in my face.


36
0:1:41,53 --> 0:1:43,79
My name is Amy Kellner.


37
0:1:43,79 --> 0:1:47,29
I'm a photo editor at the "New
York Times Magazine." Before


38
0:1:47,29 --> 0:1:49,24
that, I worked at
"Vice" magazine.


39
0:1:49,24 --> 0:1:57,58
And when I was there, I invented
"The Cute Show."


40
0:1:57,58 --> 0:1:59,19
I don't even think you should
be shooting me for this.


41
0:1:59,19 --> 0:2:1,4
You should just hear my
voice and just show a


42
0:2:1,4 --> 0:2:3,1
close-up of a kitten.


43
0:2:3,1 --> 0:2:4,767
That's all you really
want to see.


44
0:2:4,767 --> 0:2:6,955
My favorite episodes of
"The Cute Show"--


45
0:2:6,955 --> 0:2:10,4
"Cat Prin" was back in
the days of Myspace.


46
0:2:10,4 --> 0:2:12,69
People would use them as their
profile picture on


47
0:2:12,69 --> 0:2:13,7
Myspace all the time.


48
0:2:13,7 --> 0:2:17,942
The popular ones were in a frog
hat or the bunny hat.


49
0:2:17,942 --> 0:2:19,735
I would just always see those.


50
0:2:19,735 --> 0:2:21,99
And it was always
the same cats.


51
0:2:21,99 --> 0:2:23,79
And so I did some internet
sleuthing.


52
0:2:23,79 --> 0:2:27,825
And I saw that it was this
Japanese woman in Japan who is


53
0:2:27,825 --> 0:2:29,86
a cat tailor.


54
0:2:29,86 --> 0:2:31,42
JEFFREY BUSSOLINI:
Many animals--


55
0:2:31,42 --> 0:2:34,51
especially younger members
of animal species--


56
0:2:34,51 --> 0:2:38,15
have resemblances to
young humans--


57
0:2:38,15 --> 0:2:41,94
so these things like larger
eyes-- a particular kind of


58
0:2:41,94 --> 0:2:44,52
facial structure-- kind of
round facial structure.


59
0:2:44,52 --> 0:2:47,82
And that humans have an
evolutionarily developed


60
0:2:47,82 --> 0:2:51,72
capacity to sympathize with
and protect young humans.


61
0:2:51,72 --> 0:2:54,41
So the theory is that many
animals-- they trigger the


62
0:2:54,41 --> 0:2:55,31
same reaction for us.


63
0:2:55,31 --> 0:2:57,88
AMY KELLNER: She says that she
started making clothes for


64
0:2:57,88 --> 0:3:0,39
cats because God told her to.


65
0:3:0,39 --> 0:3:2,464
I want a message from
God like that.


66
0:3:2,464 --> 0:3:5,698



67
0:3:5,698 --> 0:3:6,72
JEFFREY BUSSOLINI:
Hello, Juliette.


68
0:3:6,72 --> 0:3:8,74
And welcome to the Center
for Feline Studies.


69
0:3:8,74 --> 0:3:10,94
Please come in.


70
0:3:10,94 --> 0:3:13,25
This is where we study
interactions between the cats


71
0:3:13,25 --> 0:3:15,5
and between cats and humans.


72
0:3:15,5 --> 0:3:16,73
They spend a lot of their time
hanging out here in the


73
0:3:16,73 --> 0:3:18,1
different areas of the center.


74
0:3:18,1 --> 0:3:20,48
We've got our workstations where
we can take notes about


75
0:3:20,48 --> 0:3:22,27
what they're doing and
transfer those


76
0:3:22,27 --> 0:3:23,9
notes to the computers.


77
0:3:23,9 --> 0:3:26,19
So this is from April
11, 2008.


78
0:3:26,19 --> 0:3:28,74
We see two cardboard boxes
of cats and four


79
0:3:28,74 --> 0:3:30,51
people standing around.


80
0:3:30,51 --> 0:3:32,96
Two tourists from Denmark are
talking to the cats, trying to


81
0:3:32,96 --> 0:3:35,89
calm them down, saying that if
they weren't so far from home


82
0:3:35,89 --> 0:3:38,93
and on vacation, they would
take the cats in.


83
0:3:38,93 --> 0:3:40,72
We have two different
sites of the center.


84
0:3:40,72 --> 0:3:41,6
This is the main site.


85
0:3:41,6 --> 0:3:43,58
And there are four cats
who are usually here.


86
0:3:43,58 --> 0:3:46,81
We have another site--a two cat
site-- where two sisters


87
0:3:46,81 --> 0:3:49,6
named Esmeralda and Mimi live.


88
0:3:49,6 --> 0:3:50,75
We also have a lot of photos.


89
0:3:50,75 --> 0:3:52,34
And we have some videos.


90
0:3:52,34 --> 0:3:55,43
But it's invaluable to have
thousands or millions of


91
0:3:55,43 --> 0:3:58,16
different vignettes
of cat behavior


92
0:3:58,16 --> 0:4:0,19
going on on the internet.


93
0:4:0,19 --> 0:4:3,48
AMY KELLNER: It's a subculture
of cuteness and humor.


94
0:4:3,48 --> 0:4:6,6



95
0:4:6,6 --> 0:4:7,81
JEFFREY BUSSOLINI: There's this
underground notion that


96
0:4:7,81 --> 0:4:8,986
the internet is made of cats.


97
0:4:8,986 --> 0:4:10,375
Maybe you've seen that video.


98
0:4:10,375 --> 0:4:16,855
[MUSIC PLAYING]


99
0:4:16,855 --> 0:4:19,37
JEFFREY BUSSOLINI: And that's
a fairly persuasive notion.


100
0:4:19,37 --> 0:4:21,279
Obviously, it doesn't hold
any water technically.


101
0:4:21,279 --> 0:4:23,77
AMY KELLNER: Maybe we've gotten
so jaded from all the


102
0:4:23,77 --> 0:4:25,903
sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll
that's there's nothing left


103
0:4:25,903 --> 0:4:27,827
except for just cats.


104
0:4:27,827 --> 0:4:36,485



105
0:4:36,485 --> 0:4:37,34
AMY KELLNER: You know what?


106
0:4:37,34 --> 0:4:40,18
I will say the one downside to
all the cute cat videos is


107
0:4:40,18 --> 0:4:44,5
it's kind of raised the cute
bar so high that now when I


108
0:4:44,5 --> 0:4:47,517
see a regular cat, I'm
like, you're OK--


109
0:4:47,517 --> 0:4:48,331
you know?


110
0:4:48,331 --> 0:4:50,29
JEFFREY BUSSOLINI: We as humans
are formed by our


111
0:4:50,29 --> 0:4:52,8
interactions with cats,
with dogs, with


112
0:4:52,8 --> 0:4:53,3
other kind of animals.


113
0:4:53,3 --> 0:4:55,26
That's something that's obvious
to everyone who


114
0:4:55,26 --> 0:4:56,72
actually lives with
animals, I think.


115
0:4:56,72 --> 0:5:1,45
Human culture is extensively
indebted to animal references


116
0:5:1,45 --> 0:5:4,192
and animal interactions.


117
0:5:4,192 --> 0:5:6,11
AMY KELLNER: There is
no deep thing to it.


118
0:5:6,11 --> 0:5:7,21
That's the beauty of it.


119
0:5:7,21 --> 0:5:8,0
There is no--


120
0:5:8,0 --> 0:5:8,6
I don't know.


121
0:5:8,6 --> 0:5:10,15
I just like it.


122
0:5:10,15 --> 0:5:14,14
I don't have to think
too hard about it.


123
0:5:14,14 --> 0:5:15,514
I sound dumb.


124
0:5:15,514 --> 0:5:17,69
JEFFREY BUSSOLINI: One of the
things we work on in the


125
0:5:17,69 --> 0:5:21,43
Center for Feline Studies
is cat yoga.


126
0:5:21,43 --> 0:5:29,89



127
0:5:29,89 --> 0:5:31,86
JEFFREY BUSSOLINI: We're trying
to systematically look


128
0:5:31,86 --> 0:5:33,23
at yoga with cats.


129
0:5:33,23 --> 0:5:35,65
So the way in which a lot of
their movements are basically


130
0:5:35,65 --> 0:5:37,96
a form of yoga because
they're very limber.


131
0:5:37,96 --> 0:5:40,46
But then beyond that, how
they'll join in yoga with us


132
0:5:40,46 --> 0:5:44,8
is a kind of intersubjective
communicative experience.


133
0:5:44,8 --> 0:5:46,32
Hey, Prima.


134
0:5:46,32 --> 0:5:47,17
Come on.


135
0:5:47,17 --> 0:5:48,42
Come on.


136
0:5:48,42 --> 0:5:50,25



137
0:5:50,25 --> 0:5:54,56
It seems like a very likely
story that yoga and a number


138
0:5:54,56 --> 0:5:57,56
of martial arts were developed
based on a really careful


139
0:5:57,56 --> 0:6:1,8
observation of the way that
animals behaved and then


140
0:6:1,8 --> 0:6:3,71
trying to imitate
that for humans.


141
0:6:3,71 --> 0:6:5,63
I'll try another kind of
breathing exercise.


142
0:6:5,63 --> 0:6:7,18
During this one, if we're
lucky, [INAUDIBLE]


143
0:6:7,18 --> 0:6:8,43
might hop up here.


144
0:6:8,43 --> 0:6:20,1



145
0:6:20,1 --> 0:6:22,11
The thing that got me interested
in cat yoga in the


146
0:6:22,11 --> 0:6:24,6
first place is that
I would just be


147
0:6:24,6 --> 0:6:25,26
doing yoga at my house.


148
0:6:25,26 --> 0:6:28,77
Or we would be doing yoga there
in the context of the


149
0:6:28,77 --> 0:6:30,36
Center for Feline Studies.


150
0:6:30,36 --> 0:6:31,74
And they started to join in.


151
0:6:31,74 --> 0:6:34,81
They started to show an interest
in taking part,


152
0:6:34,81 --> 0:6:37,52
either by imitating some of the
poses or by joining in--


153
0:6:37,52 --> 0:6:40,8
by getting on your stomach or
getting on your back in


154
0:6:40,8 --> 0:6:43,524
different poses.


155
0:6:43,524 --> 0:6:46,452
Hey, [INAUDIBLE],
come over here.


156
0:6:46,452 --> 0:6:48,892
[INAUDIBLE], oh, hey.


157
0:6:48,892 --> 0:6:50,142
[INAUDIBLE].


158
0:6:50,142 --> 0:6:54,26



159
0:6:54,26 --> 0:6:56,48
They're all doing their
own thing I guess.


160
0:6:56,48 --> 0:7:0,68



161
0:7:0,68 --> 0:7:1,93
Sorry.


162
0:7:1,93 --> 0:9:1,93
