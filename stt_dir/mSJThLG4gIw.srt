[Guitar music plays]


2
0:0:9,459 --> 0:0:12,451
They're coming after


3
0:0:12,451 --> 0:0:15,232
All of us at Echo Base


4
0:0:15,232 --> 0:0:18,49
They'll never capture us


5
0:0:18,49 --> 0:0:20,858
Make the jump to hyperspace


6
0:0:20,858 --> 0:0:23,559
We've got to make it


7
0:0:23,559 --> 0:0:26,138
The transport's out


8
0:0:26,138 --> 0:0:29,113
The rebels, safe


9
0:0:29,113 --> 0:0:32,76
The walker's down


10
0:0:32,76 --> 0:0:34,294
We've made our escape


11
0:0:34,294 --> 0:0:39,95
It's a dark time for the rebellion


12
0:0:39,95 --> 0:0:45,641
It's a dark time for the light side


13
0:0:45,641 --> 0:0:48,243
We've gotta save our friends


14
0:0:48,243 --> 0:0:51,493
So I jump in the X-Wing


15
0:0:51,493 --> 0:0:53,157
Say to R2


16
0:0:53,157 --> 0:0:56,73
We're going to Dagobah


17
0:0:56,73 --> 0:1:7,655
To find Master Yoda


18
0:1:7,655 --> 0:1:10,265
There's an astroid field


19
0:1:10,265 --> 0:1:13,17
They'd be crazy to follow us


20
0:1:13,17 --> 0:1:15,737
The deflector shield


21
0:1:15,737 --> 0:1:18,626
Holding strong but not enough


22
0:1:18,626 --> 0:1:21,755
We gotta make it


23
0:1:21,755 --> 0:1:24,37
Head right for


24
0:1:24,37 --> 0:1:27,461
The Star Destroyer


25
0:1:27,461 --> 0:1:29,907
This is war


26
0:1:29,907 --> 0:1:32,333
Now, punch it, Chewie!


27
0:1:32,333 --> 0:1:37,723
It's a dark time for the rebellion


28
0:1:37,723 --> 0:1:43,733
It's a dark time for the light side


29
0:1:43,733 --> 0:1:46,175
Never tell me the odds


30
0:1:46,175 --> 0:1:49,203
Can't catch the Falcon


31
0:1:49,203 --> 0:1:51,241
We're not being followed


32
0:1:51,241 --> 0:1:53,995
This isn't over yet


33
0:1:53,995 --> 0:1:57,576
Got caught by Boba Fett

35
0:2:8,374 --> 0:2:12,202
Lando's not a system, he's a man


36
0:2:12,202 --> 0:2:14,484
He's a man
- He's a man


37
0:2:14,484 --> 0:2:16,632
They're not gonna get me


38
0:2:16,632 --> 0:2:19,742
Without a fight 


39
0:2:19,742 --> 0:2:23,245
Vader arrives before them with a plan


40
0:2:23,245 --> 0:2:25,617
With a plan
- With a plan


41
0:2:25,617 --> 0:2:31,466
And Han ends up frozen in carbonite


42
0:2:31,466 --> 0:2:37,484
Mind what you've learned, save you it can


43
0:2:37,484 --> 0:2:43,25
Darth Vader, I'll never join you


44
0:2:43,25 --> 0:2:48,445
I'll never turn to the dark side


45
0:2:48,445 --> 0:2:51,413
Obi-Wan never told you


46
0:2:51,413 --> 0:2:54,171
That I am your father


47
0:2:54,171 --> 0:2:56,124
You know it to be true


48
0:2:56,124 --> 0:2:58,987
No, that's impossible


49
0:2:58,987 --> 0:4:58,987
The Empire must fall
