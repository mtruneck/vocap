1
0:0:3,344 --> 0:0:5,279
I got the afternoon free.


2
0:0:5,279 --> 0:0:7,192
You want to watch
some of that doubleheader?


3
0:0:7,192 --> 0:0:8,531
Actually, I'd love to,


4
0:0:8,531 --> 0:0:12,93
but I'm going downtown
to watch it with the guys.


5
0:0:12,93 --> 0:0:16,16
Um, why wasn't I invited?


6
0:0:16,16 --> 0:0:18,591
For the same reason we didn't
invite Bernie Madoff,


7
0:0:18,591 --> 0:0:20,413
because we knew
you were unavailable.


8
0:0:20,413 --> 0:0:22,257
Listen, man,
you just got married.


9
0:0:22,257 --> 0:0:23,908
The other guys have been married
for years,


10
0:0:23,908 --> 0:0:26,124
and they still have to lie
about where they're going.


11
0:0:26,124 --> 0:0:27,132
Oh, yeah?


12
0:0:27,132 --> 0:0:28,68
Well, I can go if I want to,


13
0:0:28,68 --> 0:0:30,66
and I don't have to lie
about it.


14
0:0:30,66 --> 0:0:32,134
So you're going to tell
Suzanne


15
0:0:32,134 --> 0:0:35,66
that you're gonna spend six
hours on a Sunday in a bar,


16
0:0:35,66 --> 0:0:38,809
drinking beer and watching
baseball with a bunch of dudes?


17
0:0:38,809 --> 0:0:42,63
$50 says that's exactly
what I'm gonna say.


18
0:0:42,63 --> 0:0:44,303
Exactly?


19
0:0:44,303 --> 0:0:46,784
Exactly-exactly.


20
0:0:46,784 --> 0:0:47,889
Come on, mom.


21
0:0:47,889 --> 0:0:48,994
That isn't fair.


22
0:0:48,994 --> 0:0:50,434
That's like t.I.
Going to jail


23
0:0:50,434 --> 0:0:52,244
for killing Patrick Swayze.


24
0:0:52,244 --> 0:0:54,22
Lindsey, that makes no sense.


25
0:0:54,22 --> 0:0:56,657
Exactly.


26
0:0:56,657 --> 0:0:58,29
What's going on?


27
0:0:58,29 --> 0:1:1,275
Oh, well, the kids are asking
me about their allowance,


28
0:1:1,275 --> 0:1:3,618
but they haven't done any work
around the house all week.


29
0:1:3,618 --> 0:1:6,661
Now, I pay you guys an allowance
to be nice;


30
0:1:6,661 --> 0:1:9,638
I'm not gonna pay y'all
just to live here anymore.


31
0:1:9,638 --> 0:1:11,913
Come on,
your mother is right.


32
0:1:11,913 --> 0:1:14,187
You kids know an allowance
is payment for work,


33
0:1:14,187 --> 0:1:15,49
just like a job.


34
0:1:15,49 --> 0:1:17,597
If you don't do your job,
you don't get paid.


35
0:1:17,597 --> 0:1:19,36
Thank you, Nick.


36
0:1:19,36 --> 0:1:21,143
We promise to do more work
this week.


37
0:1:21,143 --> 0:1:22,513
Yeah, we promise.


38
0:1:22,513 --> 0:1:26,158
And I promise to pay you
when you do the work.


39
0:1:26,158 --> 0:1:27,996
What about this week?


40
0:1:27,996 --> 0:1:30,503
You should've thought about
this week last week.


41
0:1:30,503 --> 0:1:32,877
If you don't start thinking
about next week this week,


42
0:1:32,877 --> 0:1:34,783
you're going to have
the same problem next week


43
0:1:34,783 --> 0:1:35,886
that you're having this week,


44
0:1:35,886 --> 0:1:37,824
when you could've solved it
last week.


45
0:1:37,824 --> 0:1:39,729
So we're not gonna get
our money from last week


46
0:1:39,729 --> 0:1:41,32
until next week?


47
0:1:41,32 --> 0:1:42,269
What about this week?


48
0:1:42,269 --> 0:1:44,274
There is no "this week."


49
0:1:44,274 --> 0:1:46,345
Now, I don't understand
what you're worried about.


50
0:1:46,345 --> 0:1:47,581
You have everything you need.


51
0:1:47,581 --> 0:1:49,821
But it's summer.
We need disposable income.


52
0:1:49,821 --> 0:1:53,663
Well, by being lazy, you threw
away last week's allowance.


53
0:1:53,663 --> 0:1:55,167
So I suggest,


54
0:1:55,167 --> 0:1:57,84
unless you want to dispose
of this week's allowance,


55
0:1:57,84 --> 0:1:58,876
you get to work.


56
0:1:58,876 --> 0:1:59,845
Got it?


57
0:1:59,845 --> 0:2:3,85
Got it.


58
0:2:3,85 --> 0:2:5,792
Oh, hello, Martin.


59
0:2:5,792 --> 0:2:6,694
Hi, Suzanne.


60
0:2:6,694 --> 0:2:8,663
What are you guys
up to today?


61
0:2:8,663 --> 0:2:9,632
Hmm.


62
0:2:9,632 --> 0:2:11,37
What are we up to, Nick?


63
0:2:11,37 --> 0:2:13,876
Today I am going to
a sports bar, on a Sunday,


64
0:2:13,876 --> 0:2:16,47
for six hours,
to drink beer and watch baseball


65
0:2:16,47 --> 0:2:17,784
with a bunch of dudes.


66
0:2:17,784 --> 0:2:21,558
Great.
Good for you.


67
0:2:21,558 --> 0:2:22,861
See?


68
0:2:22,861 --> 0:2:24,663
A real man doesn't have to lie
to his wife.


69
0:2:24,663 --> 0:2:26,501
Now pay up.


70
0:2:26,501 --> 0:2:30,209
Next week.

hi, there.


76
0:2:50,316 --> 0:2:52,219
Hi, there.
Welcome to Booty.


77
0:2:52,219 --> 0:2:54,19
Hello.


78
0:2:54,19 --> 0:2:56,527
Man, I thought we were going
to a regular sports bar.


79
0:2:56,527 --> 0:2:58,464
You didn't tell me
we were going to Booty.


80
0:2:58,464 --> 0:2:59,867
What's wrong with Booty?


81
0:2:59,867 --> 0:3:2,471
It's a pirate-themed sports bar,
hence the name "booty,"


82
0:3:2,471 --> 0:3:3,808
like treasure.


83
0:3:3,808 --> 0:3:5,243
Hmm, hi, guys.


84
0:3:5,243 --> 0:3:6,847
That's treasure.


85
0:3:6,847 --> 0:3:8,82
Man, I gotta get out of here.


86
0:3:8,82 --> 0:3:10,486
How am I gonna explain this
to Suzanne?


87
0:3:10,486 --> 0:3:11,755
Oh, aren't you the real man


88
0:3:11,755 --> 0:3:13,592
who doesn't have to lie
to his wife?


89
0:3:13,592 --> 0:3:15,528
We're doing exactly what you
said we were gonna do:


90
0:3:15,528 --> 0:3:17,966
We're at the bar, drinking beer,
watching the game.


91
0:3:17,966 --> 0:3:19,402
Yeah, but she's gonna
want to know


92
0:3:19,402 --> 0:3:20,905
why I had to watch the game
here.


93
0:3:20,905 --> 0:3:23,81
Because Booty has
such amazing...


94
0:3:23,81 --> 0:3:25,98
Wings.


95
0:3:25,98 --> 0:3:27,917
Ah, there are the guys.


96
0:3:27,917 --> 0:3:30,321
Aha.
Ahoy, mateys.


97
0:3:30,321 --> 0:3:34,862
Arrr.


98
0:3:34,862 --> 0:3:38,601
Ah, these wings
are disgusting.


99
0:3:38,601 --> 0:3:40,37
What's the score of the game?


100
0:3:40,37 --> 0:3:42,408
Uh, 36 to 24


101
0:3:42,408 --> 0:3:44,511
to 40.


102
0:3:44,511 --> 0:3:49,552
Wow, this is
a high-scoring game.


103
0:3:49,552 --> 0:3:51,789
So what did you tell Suzanne
to get out of the house?


104
0:3:51,789 --> 0:3:53,459
I told her I was coming
to watch the game.


105
0:3:53,459 --> 0:3:54,794
Huh, I didn't.


106
0:3:54,794 --> 0:3:56,798
I told my wife I was going
to the grocery store.


107
0:3:56,798 --> 0:4:1,37
And on my way home, I'll be sure
to stop at the grocery store.


108
0:4:1,37 --> 0:4:4,141
Yeah, I told my wife
I was going to a strip club,


109
0:4:4,141 --> 0:4:7,709
but instead I came here.


110
0:4:7,709 --> 0:4:9,909
What is wrong with you, man?


111
0:4:9,909 --> 0:4:11,31
I got an idea.


112
0:4:11,31 --> 0:4:13,312
Let's tell treasure
that it's Nick's birthday,


113
0:4:13,312 --> 0:4:14,48
and we'll get them to give him


114
0:4:14,48 --> 0:4:16,281
one of their special
birthday celebrations.


115
0:4:16,281 --> 0:4:17,715
Ugh.
Love that.


116
0:4:17,715 --> 0:4:20,84
What special
birthday celebration?


117
0:4:20,84 --> 0:4:20,985
Come on, man.


118
0:4:20,985 --> 0:4:22,52
You never had
a Booty birthday?


119
0:4:22,52 --> 0:4:24,555
No, and I don't want
a Booty birthday.


120
0:4:24,555 --> 0:4:26,256
I didn't know it was
your birthday, Nick.


121
0:4:26,256 --> 0:4:27,29
How old are you?


122
0:4:27,29 --> 0:4:29,192
Dude, I'm not...
Oh, treasure.


123
0:4:29,192 --> 0:4:31,61
This scallywag be having
a birthday.


124
0:4:31,61 --> 0:4:32,696
Hey.


125
0:4:32,696 --> 0:4:34,497
Someone has a birthday?


126
0:4:34,497 --> 0:4:35,632
Ladies, come on over here.


127
0:4:35,632 --> 0:4:36,633
We got a birthday.


128
0:4:36,633 --> 0:4:37,801
Happy Birthday.


129

We finished all our chores.


145
0:5:15,61 --> 0:5:16,744
I cleaned up my room,


146
0:5:16,744 --> 0:5:18,546
and I took all the clothes
out of my hamper.


147
0:5:18,546 --> 0:5:22,649
Yup, and I made my bed
and unclogged the toilet.


148
0:5:22,649 --> 0:5:25,17
Kevin, aren't you the one
who clogged the toilet?


149
0:5:25,17 --> 0:5:28,519
Yeah, it was a good one.


150
0:5:28,519 --> 0:5:32,223
So do we get
our allowances now?


151
0:5:32,223 --> 0:5:34,86
Guys, I'm really proud of you
for doing those things,


152
0:5:34,86 --> 0:5:35,894
but no.


153
0:5:35,894 --> 0:5:39,364
So I unclogged the toilet
for nothing?


154
0:5:39,364 --> 0:5:41,766
No, you unclogged the toilet
'cause that's nasty.


155
0:5:41,766 --> 0:5:45,437
So what exactly do we need
to do to get our allowance?


156
0:5:45,437 --> 0:5:46,939
You need to show
some initiative,


157
0:5:46,939 --> 0:5:48,874
and I'll pay you
for what it's worth.


158
0:5:48,874 --> 0:5:51,31
We are showing initiative.
How?


159
0:5:51,31 --> 0:6:5,655
By trying to convince you
to give us money.


160
0:6:5,655 --> 0:6:8,523
I'm so glad you had a good
time today with your friends.


161
0:6:8,523 --> 0:6:10,224
Where'd you guys go, anyway?


162
0:6:10,224 --> 0:6:12,257
No-hitter?


163
0:6:12,257 --> 0:6:13,892
No, I don't think so.


164
0:6:13,892 --> 0:6:16,356
It was some other place.


165
0:6:16,356 --> 0:6:19,224
Was it the scoreboard?


166
0:6:19,224 --> 0:6:21,526
No, I don't think so.


167
0:6:21,526 --> 0:6:23,694
Well, there's only a few
sports bars.


168
0:6:23,694 --> 0:6:26,863
You guys were downtown,
right?


169
0:6:26,863 --> 0:6:30,165
Yeah, I think so.


170
0:6:30,165 --> 0:6:32,1
You think so?


171
0:6:32,1 --> 0:6:35,569
Were you, or weren't you?


172
0:6:35,569 --> 0:6:36,604
I don't know.


173
0:6:36,604 --> 0:6:37,705
You know, Martin was driving.


174
0:6:37,705 --> 0:6:41,709
I was just out having
a good time.


175
0:6:41,709 --> 0:6:43,11
Nick.


176
0:6:43,11 --> 0:6:45,714
Were you or weren't you
downtown at a sports bar,


177
0:6:45,714 --> 0:6:48,951
watching the baseball game?


178
0:6:48,951 --> 0:6:51,92
I was.


179
0:6:51,92 --> 0:6:54,956
Well...


180
0:6:54,956 --> 0:6:57,359
You weren't at the scoreboard.


181
0:6:57,359 --> 0:6:59,194
You weren't at no-hitter.


182
0:6:59,194 --> 0:7:2,3
So where were you?


183
0:7:2,3 --> 0:7:4,865
Dang, I don't remember
the name of it.


184
0:7:4,865 --> 0:7:9,102
Well, the only other place
that's open on Sundays is Booty,


185
0:7:9,102 --> 0:7:12,705
and I know you weren't at Booty.


186
0:7:12,705 --> 0:7:14,707
Hmm.


187
0:7:14,707 --> 0:7:16,942
Which one was that again?


188
0:7:16,942 --> 0:7:20,178
The one with all the girls
with the big booties


189
0:7:20,178 --> 0:7:23,714
dressed in pirate outfits.


190
0:7:23,714 --> 0:7:26,717
Hmm.


191
0:7:26,717 --> 0:7:28,885
Come to think of it,


192
0:7:28,885 --> 0:7:31,387
yeah, I think
that's where we were.


193
0:7:31,387 --> 0:7:36,524
You spent
six hours drinking,


194
0:7:36,524 --> 0:7:40,58
watching the game
with your friends at Booty?


195
0:7:40,58 --> 0:7:42,58
Baby, you told me to go out
and have a good time.


196
0:7:42,58 --> 0:7:43,859
Not when it's at Booty!


197
0:7:43,859 --> 0:7:45,293
Baby, it's not what you think.


198
0:7:45,293 --> 0:7:48,62
Look, they just have the most
tvs, the cheapest beer,


199
0:7:48,62 --> 0:7:49,163
and the best wings.


200
0:7:49,163 --> 0:7:50,265
You lied to me.


201
0:7:50,265 --> 0:7:51,8
No, I didn't.


202
0:7:51,8 --> 0:7:54,1
Look, baby, I didn't even know
that's where we were going


203
0:7:54,1 --> 0:7:55,568
until we got there.


204
0:7:55,568 --> 0:7:57,804
Okay, so why didn't you tell
me that's where you were


205
0:7:57,804 --> 0:7:59,172
when you got home?


206
0:7:59,172 --> 0:8:0,34
Because it didn't come up.


207
0:8:0,34 --> 0:8:2,108
And when it did, I told you.


208
0:8:2,108 --> 0:8:4,43
So what's the problem?


209
0:8:4,43 --> 0:8:6,845
You really don't know
what the problem is?


210
0:8:6,845 --> 0:8:9,413
No, I don't.


211
0:8:9,413 --> 0:8:29,231
Well, you are about
to find out.


212
0:8:29,231 --> 0:8:31,2
Here's some more orange juice
for you, mom.


213
0:8:31,2 --> 0:8:32,601
Thank you, Lindsey.


214
0:8:32,601 --> 0:8:35,303
Yeah, let me get that
for you, mom.


215
0:8:35,303 --> 0:8:36,57
Thank you, Kevin.


216
0:8:36,57 --> 0:8:38,71
And we also got up
extra early


217
0:8:38,71 --> 0:8:40,839
and washed your car
and swept up the front yard.


218
0:8:40,839 --> 0:8:43,273
So can we have
our allowances now?


219
0:8:43,273 --> 0:8:44,674
No.


220
0:8:44,674 --> 0:8:46,377
What?
How come?


221
0:8:46,377 --> 0:8:48,812
Well, because I noticed
that your beds aren't made,


222
0:8:48,812 --> 0:8:50,747
and, Lindsey, you have clothes
all over the floor,


223
0:8:50,747 --> 0:8:54,55
and, Kevin,
the toilet is backed up again.


224
0:8:54,55 --> 0:8:56,985
Just because you wake up early
and wash my car


225
0:8:56,985 --> 0:8:58,386
and clean the front yard


226
0:8:58,386 --> 0:9:1,622
doesn't mean you get to neglect
your everyday chores.


227
0:9:1,622 --> 0:9:3,723
So I washed your car
for nothing?


228
0:9:3,723 --> 0:9:5,658
You didn't wash my car
for nothing.


229
0:9:5,658 --> 0:9:8,728
Now both of you go upstairs
and clean your rooms.


230
0:9:8,728 --> 0:9:9,763
Hi, Nick.


231
0:9:9,763 --> 0:9:13,699
Hey.


232
0:9:13,699 --> 0:9:17,402
Where's my breakfast?


233
0:9:17,402 --> 0:9:18,703
Why don't you eat at Booty,


234
0:9:18,703 --> 0:9:22,772
since you love their food
so much?


235
0:9:22,772 --> 0:9:26,176
Where's your breakfast?


236
0:9:26,176 --> 0:9:27,277
That's ridiculous.


237
0:9:27,277 --> 0:9:39,153
They don't even
serve breakfast.


238
0:9:39,153 --> 0:9:41,888
Let me ask you something,
Gigi.


239
0:9:41,888 --> 0:9:43,489
What do you do
when you find out


240
0:9:43,489 --> 0:9:46,725
a man's been withholding
information from you?


241
0:9:46,725 --> 0:9:51,61
Well, it depends
on two things:


242
0:9:51,61 --> 0:9:53,998
The kind of information
and how I found out.


243
0:9:53,998 --> 0:9:55,366
Like, this one time I found out


244
0:9:55,366 --> 0:9:57,168
not only was this guy
cheating on me,


245
0:9:57,168 --> 0:9:59,35
but he was lying
about his money.


246
0:9:59,35 --> 0:10:0,237
How'd you find out?


247
0:10:0,237 --> 0:10:1,871
The other woman told me.


248
0:10:1,871 --> 0:10:3,54
He and I had just come back
from Aruba,


249
0:10:3,54 --> 0:10:7,8
and she said he had just
taken <i>her</i> to Aruba.


250
0:10:7,8 --> 0:10:8,31
And I was gonna stay with him,


251
0:10:8,31 --> 0:10:11,214
until I found out where
he was getting his money from.


252
0:10:11,214 --> 0:10:13,284
Where?
From her.


253
0:10:13,284 --> 0:10:15,289
If I'd known that, I would have
gone to Aruba with her,


254
0:10:15,289 --> 0:10:17,724
and we both could have got
a man.


255
0:10:17,724 --> 0:10:19,59
Does that help?


256
0:10:19,59 --> 0:10:20,59
Not really.


257
0:10:20,59 --> 0:10:22,428
Oh.


258
0:10:22,428 --> 0:10:25,397
Is Nick hiding something
from you?


259
0:10:25,397 --> 0:10:27,966
Well, yesterday, he went to
watch baseball for six hours


260
0:10:27,966 --> 0:10:29,701
with his friends at Booty.


261
0:10:29,701 --> 0:10:30,702
Booty?


262
0:10:30,702 --> 0:10:32,403
I love Booty.


263
0:10:32,403 --> 0:10:33,537
You do?
I do.


264
0:10:33,537 --> 0:10:34,972
It's so much fun.


265
0:10:34,972 --> 0:10:36,64
How'd you find out?


266
0:10:36,64 --> 0:10:40,176
I asked him,
and he admitted he went.


267
0:10:40,176 --> 0:10:42,411
You--you asked him a question,


268
0:10:42,411 --> 0:10:45,13
and he could've lied,
but he told you the truth,


269
0:10:45,13 --> 0:10:46,381
and now you're mad at him?


270
0:10:46,381 --> 0:10:47,415
Yes.


271
0:10:47,415 --> 0:10:51,318
I can see that.


272
0:10:51,318 --> 0:10:55,123

0:11:4,62 --> 0:11:6,565
We need to talk about Booty.


276
0:11:6,565 --> 0:11:9,633
Suzanne, I still don't know
what the big deal is.


277
0:11:9,633 --> 0:11:13,36
Look, it's just a fun place
where guys go to watch games.


278
0:11:13,36 --> 0:11:15,905
Mm-hmm.
So who won the game?


279
0:11:15,905 --> 0:11:19,575
The, um...


280
0:11:19,575 --> 0:11:21,477
And that's why
it's a big deal.


281
0:11:21,477 --> 0:11:23,446
Oh, so now I got to tell you
about every place I go


282
0:11:23,446 --> 0:11:24,881
to do everything I do?


283
0:11:24,881 --> 0:11:28,151
When you go grocery shopping, I
don't know exactly where you go.


284
0:11:28,151 --> 0:11:30,22
Because the guys bagging
my groceries


285
0:11:30,22 --> 0:11:32,455
aren't walking around
with oily pecs,


286
0:11:32,455 --> 0:11:36,693
in jockstraps,
talking about paper or plastic.

289
0:11:46,301 --> 0:11:48,602
Look, Suzanne,
it's not like that.


290
0:11:48,602 --> 0:11:49,936
Okay, you're overreacting.


291
0:11:49,936 --> 0:11:52,372
I told you,
they have the best wings.


292
0:11:52,372 --> 0:11:54,775
All right?
All kinds of people go there.


293
0:11:54,775 --> 0:11:55,709
Families, everybody.


294
0:11:55,709 --> 0:11:57,71
Really?
Really.


295
0:11:57,71 --> 0:11:58,978
Okay, fine.


296
0:11:58,978 --> 0:12:0,112
I believe you.


297
0:12:0,112 --> 0:12:1,513
Thank you.


298
0:12:1,513 --> 0:12:4,382
So tonight you, me and the
kids are going to eat at Booty.


299
0:12:4,382 --> 0:12:5,85
Excuse me?


300
0:12:5,85 --> 0:12:8,519
We're gonna order the wings.


301
0:12:8,519 --> 0:12:16,756
And you can turn your music
back on.


302
0:12:16,756 --> 0:12:18,691
 so you sure
you want to do this?


303
0:12:18,691 --> 0:12:26,598
Yep, I really want to taste
those wings.


304
0:12:26,598 --> 0:12:28,467
I can't believe we're really
going to eat there.


305
0:12:28,467 --> 0:12:29,935
Me neither.
This is awesome.


306
0:12:29,935 --> 0:12:31,503
I've always wanted to go there.


307
0:12:31,503 --> 0:12:32,571
For what?


308
0:12:32,571 --> 0:12:35,4
It's food served by pirates.


309
0:12:35,4 --> 0:12:36,675
Yeah,


310
0:12:36,675 --> 0:12:49,687
in Booty shorts.


311
0:12:49,687 --> 0:12:50,789
Well, here we are,


312
0:12:50,789 --> 0:12:52,99
just like you wanted.


313
0:12:52,99 --> 0:12:55,493
Whoa, look at the size
of those jugs.


314
0:12:55,493 --> 0:12:58,128
Kevin, that is no way to talk
about a woman.


315
0:12:58,128 --> 0:13:1,23
He's talking about
the pitchers of beer.


316
0:13:1,23 --> 0:13:2,197
Oh.


317
0:13:2,197 --> 0:13:6,435
Whoa.
Look how big that Booty is.


318
0:13:6,435 --> 0:13:8,87
He's talking about
the treasure chest by the door.


319
0:13:8,87 --> 0:13:10,405
No, I'm not.


320
0:13:10,405 --> 0:13:12,73
This place is tacky.


321
0:13:12,73 --> 0:13:13,574
Are we really
gonna eat here?


322
0:13:13,574 --> 0:13:14,775
Yes, we are.


323
0:13:14,775 --> 0:13:17,177
I'm doing this to prove a point
to your father.


324
0:13:17,177 --> 0:13:18,345
What point?


325
0:13:18,345 --> 0:13:20,914
That he has no taste in food?


326
0:13:20,914 --> 0:13:23,83
Oh, hey, Nick.
How you doing?


327
0:13:23,83 --> 0:13:24,5
How's it going?


328
0:13:24,5 --> 0:13:25,84
Treasure?


329
0:13:25,84 --> 0:13:26,619
I'm Suzanne.
I'm Nick's wife.


330
0:13:26,619 --> 0:13:27,82
Oh, Suzanne.


331
0:13:27,82 --> 0:13:28,888
Beautiful.


332
0:13:28,888 --> 0:13:30,389
I didn't know
you were married, Nick.


333
0:13:30,389 --> 0:13:31,557
That's great.


334
0:13:31,557 --> 0:13:33,358
Wow, and you have your beautiful
kids with you.


335
0:13:33,358 --> 0:13:34,426
Thank you.


336
0:13:34,426 --> 0:13:35,894
Okay, so what can I get you
to order?


337
0:13:35,894 --> 0:13:38,562
We have heard so much
about those wings.


338
0:13:38,562 --> 0:13:39,629
Ah, those wings.


339
0:13:39,629 --> 0:13:41,13
So how about I bring you
some over?


340
0:13:41,13 --> 0:13:42,598
Great.
All right, birthday boy.


341
0:13:42,598 --> 0:13:44,633
I'll be right back.


342
0:13:44,633 --> 0:13:47,202
Birthday boy?


343
0:13:47,202 --> 0:13:50,37
Oh, I almost forgot.


344
0:13:50,37 --> 0:13:51,704
Martin and the guys
thought it'd be funny


345
0:13:51,704 --> 0:13:53,839
if they told the waitresses
it was my birthday.


346
0:13:53,839 --> 0:13:58,309
Oh, and what type
of celebration do they do?


347
0:13:58,309 --> 0:13:59,71
Oh...


348
0:13:59,71 --> 0:14:2,111
You just get some free wings,
and they sing <i>happy birthday.</i>


349
0:14:2,111 --> 0:14:3,679
It's no big deal.


350
0:14:3,679 --> 0:14:5,113
All right, ladies.
Listen up.


351
0:14:5,113 --> 0:14:6,713
We got another birthday.


352
0:14:6,713 --> 0:14:8,815

Uh-uh!


359
0:14:36,539 --> 0:14:37,507
Sorry, buddy.


360
0:14:37,507 --> 0:14:39,675
You got yourself
into this one.


361
0:14:39,675 --> 0:14:41,109
What are you talking about?


362
0:14:41,109 --> 0:14:42,944
You're the one that dragged me
down there.


363
0:14:42,944 --> 0:14:44,12
Yeah, but I didn't tell you


364
0:14:44,12 --> 0:14:46,82
to turn it into
a family field trip.


365
0:14:46,82 --> 0:14:47,25
It doesn't matter.


366
0:14:47,25 --> 0:14:49,418
She would've gotten mad
anyway.


367
0:14:49,418 --> 0:14:50,92
Yes, but if
you had told her,


368
0:14:50,92 --> 0:14:52,522
she would've gotten mad
ahead of time,


369
0:14:52,522 --> 0:14:54,9
which is a lot better.


370
0:14:54,9 --> 0:14:55,526
None of this
would have happened


371
0:14:55,526 --> 0:14:59,593
if she hadn't seen that stupid
birthday celebration.


372
0:14:59,593 --> 0:15:4,63
Nick, please tell me she did
not witness a Booty birthday.


373
0:15:4,63 --> 0:15:6,364
She witnessed
a Booty birthday.


374
0:15:6,364 --> 0:15:8,666
Oh, come on, man.


375
0:15:8,666 --> 0:15:10,301
Listen,
you say you want my help,


376
0:15:10,301 --> 0:15:12,935
but then you won't even tell me
everything that happened.


377
0:15:12,935 --> 0:15:14,203
You're like Keyser Soze,


378
0:15:14,203 --> 0:15:16,938
just dolling out little pieces
of information,


379
0:15:16,938 --> 0:15:19,64
hoping I'll figure it out like
I'm the closer or something.


380
0:15:19,64 --> 0:15:22,476
Do I look like Kyra Sedgwick
to you?


381
0:15:22,476 --> 0:15:24,611
You want my advice?
Here it is:


382
0:15:24,611 --> 0:15:26,146
Be Nick.
Okay?


383
0:15:26,146 --> 0:15:27,748
Don't be
some phony-acting Nick


384
0:15:27,748 --> 0:15:29,349
who thinks he can do
whatever he wants,


385
0:15:29,349 --> 0:15:30,317
even though he's married,


386
0:15:30,317 --> 0:15:31,985
because if your wife
is mad at you


387
0:15:31,985 --> 0:15:34,2
and you were with me,
it's only a matter of time


388
0:15:34,2 --> 0:15:35,721
before I start catching heat.


389
0:15:35,721 --> 0:15:37,255
And if I wanted some wife
to be mad at me,


390
0:15:37,255 --> 0:15:49,866
I'd go to Russia
and I'd buy one of my own.


391
0:15:49,866 --> 0:15:52,135
Okay, mom,
we finished everything.


392
0:15:52,135 --> 0:15:54,77
So can we have
our allowances now?


393
0:15:54,77 --> 0:15:56,638
Well, I guess you guys
have earned it.


394
0:15:56,638 --> 0:15:58,24
Yes.
Yes.


395
0:15:58,24 --> 0:16:6,18
All right, Kevin,
go get my purse, please.


396
0:16:6,18 --> 0:16:7,281
Thank you.


397
0:16:7,281 --> 0:16:8,95
$50.


398
0:16:8,95 --> 0:16:9,984
Okay, here you go.


399
0:16:9,984 --> 0:16:12,719
$5 each.


400
0:16:12,719 --> 0:16:14,155
$5?


401
0:16:14,155 --> 0:16:15,556
That's it?


402
0:16:15,556 --> 0:16:17,658
If would've known we were only
going to get paid $5,


403
0:16:17,658 --> 0:16:19,826
we would have never did
any of this stuff.


404
0:16:19,826 --> 0:16:21,961
Which is exactly why
I didn't tell you


405
0:16:21,961 --> 0:16:23,695
I was giving you $5.


406
0:16:23,695 --> 0:16:25,73
Okay.
I'm gonna go back upstairs,


407
0:16:25,73 --> 0:16:27,165
take all my clothes
out of my hamper,


408
0:16:27,165 --> 0:16:28,632
and throw them back down
on the floor.


409
0:16:28,632 --> 0:16:30,868
I'm gonna go reclog
the toilet.


410
0:16:30,868 --> 0:16:33,136
Freeze.


411
0:16:33,136 --> 0:16:36,339
So just because I don't give in
to your demands,


412
0:16:36,339 --> 0:16:38,908
you're going to go destroy
my house?


413
0:16:38,908 --> 0:16:40,75
Who are you, the Taliban?


414
0:16:40,75 --> 0:16:42,143
I do not negotiate
with terrorists.


415
0:16:42,143 --> 0:16:43,544
So here is the deal:


416
0:16:43,544 --> 0:16:46,18
You're either going to take
the $5,


417
0:16:46,18 --> 0:16:48,516
or you're going to take nothing.


418
0:16:48,516 --> 0:16:50,45
We'll take it.


419
0:16:50,45 --> 0:16:52,651
And you'll be happy about it.


420
0:16:52,651 --> 0:16:58,791
Thank you.


421
0:16:58,791 --> 0:17:9,27
Ya'll better not mess up
my house.

426
0:17:29,779 --> 0:17:32,314
Nick, can we have, like,
20 bucks each?


427
0:17:32,314 --> 0:17:33,481
Like, no.


428
0:17:33,481 --> 0:17:35,249
Didn't your mother give you
your allowance?


429
0:17:35,249 --> 0:17:36,716
Yeah, but it was only
5 bucks.


430
0:17:36,716 --> 0:17:39,383
And a full day at the mall is
gonna cost me at least a 20.


431
0:17:39,383 --> 0:17:40,985
Well, why don't you take
that 5 bucks


432
0:17:40,985 --> 0:17:42,453
and spend a quarter day
at the mall?


433
0:17:42,453 --> 0:17:43,787
Or you can save that 5 bucks,


434
0:17:43,787 --> 0:17:45,921
keep doing work until
you have the money you need.


435
0:17:45,921 --> 0:17:47,923
That's the lesson your mom's
trying to teach you.


436
0:17:47,923 --> 0:17:49,558
We don't want lessons.


437
0:17:49,558 --> 0:17:50,992
We want money.


438
0:17:50,992 --> 0:17:53,327
Do you want to live
to spend it?


439
0:17:53,327 --> 0:17:54,295
Sorry.


440
0:17:54,295 --> 0:17:55,796
What do you need
the money for?


441
0:17:55,796 --> 0:17:56,763
I don't know.


442
0:17:56,763 --> 0:17:57,764
Stuff.


443
0:17:57,764 --> 0:17:59,198
Stuff?


444
0:17:59,198 --> 0:18:1,4
You guys are pulling your hair
out because you want money,


445
0:18:1,4 --> 0:18:2,734
and you don't even know
what you want it for?


446
0:18:2,734 --> 0:18:4,236
We want mad money.


447
0:18:4,236 --> 0:18:6,337
I'm not giving you guys money
just so you can have it.


448
0:18:6,337 --> 0:18:7,438
I'm sorry.


449
0:18:7,438 --> 0:18:9,7
We forgive you.


450
0:18:9,7 --> 0:18:11,209
<i>Now</i> can we have some money?


451
0:18:11,209 --> 0:18:13,311
No.
Do some work.


452
0:18:13,311 --> 0:18:14,712
Fine.


453
0:18:14,712 --> 0:18:27,489
Maybe I'll get a job at Booty.


454
0:18:27,489 --> 0:18:29,924
Suzanne,
what are you afraid of?


455
0:18:29,924 --> 0:18:32,26
That he's gonna leave you
for a girl with a big Booty


456
0:18:32,26 --> 0:18:33,494
and a bucket of wings?


457
0:18:33,494 --> 0:18:35,396
I don't know.


458
0:18:35,396 --> 0:18:36,73
Let me tell you this:


459
0:18:36,73 --> 0:18:39,332
Big Booty is unavoidable.


460
0:18:39,332 --> 0:18:40,767
It's at the park.


461
0:18:40,767 --> 0:18:42,768
It's at the grocery store.


462
0:18:42,768 --> 0:18:44,403
It's even at church.


463
0:18:44,403 --> 0:18:47,205
You can't hide from big Booty.


464
0:18:47,205 --> 0:18:50,441
Big booty--it's everywhere.


465
0:18:50,441 --> 0:18:53,109
I know that Booty
is everywhere.


466
0:18:53,109 --> 0:18:55,11
I don't need him
to pretend it's not.


467
0:18:55,11 --> 0:18:57,612
But if he's gonna go there,
I just want to know about it.


468
0:18:57,612 --> 0:18:59,13
That's all.


469
0:18:59,13 --> 0:19:3,16
Well, have you tried
telling him that?


470
0:19:3,16 --> 0:19:3,983
I mean, come on.


471
0:19:3,983 --> 0:19:15,558
You're good.
Thank you.


472
0:19:15,558 --> 0:19:18,127
Man, I don't know
how you do it.


473
0:19:18,127 --> 0:19:19,996
I wish I was more like you.


474
0:19:19,996 --> 0:19:23,601
Every time you get in trouble,
you just blurt out the truth.


475
0:19:23,601 --> 0:19:29,473
They always say the cover-up
is worse than the crime.


476
0:19:29,473 --> 0:19:31,407
Hey, baby.
Hey.


477
0:19:31,407 --> 0:19:34,42
I just ran into the kids.


478
0:19:34,42 --> 0:19:36,609
Thank you for backing me up.


479
0:19:36,609 --> 0:19:37,71
Well, you're right.


480
0:19:37,71 --> 0:19:39,946
You're teaching them
a valuable lesson.


481
0:19:39,946 --> 0:19:41,747
I'm trying to.


482
0:19:41,747 --> 0:19:45,117
You know you could've just
told me you were at Booty.


483
0:19:45,117 --> 0:19:46,851
I was afraid
you would have gotten mad.


484
0:19:46,851 --> 0:19:48,785
That's right.
I would have.


485
0:19:48,785 --> 0:19:50,253
Then what am I
supposed to do?


486
0:19:50,253 --> 0:19:52,521
You're supposed to get used
to me getting mad at things.


487
0:19:52,521 --> 0:19:53,522
Great.


488
0:19:53,522 --> 0:19:55,23
No, but I would've gotten
over it.


489
0:19:55,23 --> 0:19:57,592
You know, I don't understand why
you even want to go there.


490
0:19:57,592 --> 0:19:58,927
Okay, I understand...


491
0:19:58,927 --> 0:20:1,596
Look, it's not even
that I want to go to Booty.


492
0:20:1,596 --> 0:20:3,864
It's just that I don't like
knowing there are places


493
0:20:3,864 --> 0:20:5,698
I might want to go and can't.


494
0:20:5,698 --> 0:20:8,99
Nick, I don't care
where you go.


495
0:20:8,99 --> 0:20:10,134
I just care
about what you do.


496
0:20:10,134 --> 0:20:11,837
I'll tell you what:


497
0:20:11,837 --> 0:20:14,173
You tell me beforehand,
and you can go to Booty


498
0:20:14,173 --> 0:20:15,64
any time you want--


499
0:20:15,64 --> 0:20:18,41
except your actual birthday.


500
0:20:18,41 --> 0:20:19,377
Why?


501
0:20:19,377 --> 0:20:20,445
What do you think I might do?


502
0:20:20,445 --> 0:20:21,746
End up in the hospital


503
0:20:21,746 --> 0:20:26,683
if I even think you did
something besides eat wings.


504
0:20:26,683 --> 0:20:30,719
I have all the wings I need
right here.


505
0:20:30,719 --> 0:20:31,954
Oh.
I forgot.


506
0:20:31,954 --> 0:20:33,488
I got you something.


507
0:20:33,488 --> 0:20:34,556
You got me something?


508
0:20:34,556 --> 0:20:37,591
Yeah;
I mean, it's for me,


509
0:20:37,591 --> 0:20:42,494
but it's mostly for you.


510
0:20:42,494 --> 0:20:44,162
Oh.


511
0:20:44,162 --> 0:20:46,76
Well, first we'll dive
into these,


512
0:20:46,76 --> 0:20:48,259
and then we'll dive into those.
