He lives in an area called the

with a little assistance from

Heimo Korth moved to Alaska when
he was 19 to get as far

0:2:52,48 --> 0:2:55,52
away as possible from
human civilization.


58
0:2:55,52 --> 0:2:58,26
He met his wife Edna while
living in an Eskimo whaling


59
0:2:58,26 --> 0:3:1,53
village on St. Lawrence Island
in the Bering Sea.


60
0:3:1,53 --> 0:3:3,78

move with him to the harsh

150 miles above the Arctic

71

The Korths migrate annually
between three separate cabins.

Rotating cabins keeps them from
depleting the resources

there should always be


76
0:3:42,8 --> 0:3:44,89

just saw off the horns and

the eyeballs out and then

And this way, a bear
can't get into it.

We have an extra satellite
phone, and it goes in there.


211
0:9:20,64 --> 0:9:23,36
And that is in case the
cabin burns down.

you had this cabin?


213

HEIMO KORTH: Oh, we built
this one in 1984.

0:9:27,98 --> 0:9:29,68
And this pole here, this
is a tree that


215
0:9:29,68 --> 0:9:30,81
was here and it died.


216
0:9:30,81 --> 0:9:35,34
But I attached the satellite
phone antenna to it.


217
0:9:35,34 --> 0:9:37,77
And then this other antenna,
right straight up, that's for


218
0:9:37,77 --> 0:9:39,82
the aircraft radio so I
can talk to airplanes.

dressing and the guns?

the shotgun in


221
0:9:43,17 --> 0:9:44,6
case there's a bear.


222
0:9:44,6 --> 0:9:45,56
There's a rifle here for
the caribou, and


223
0:9:45,56 --> 0:9:47,7
this .22 for grouse.


224
0:9:47,7 --> 0:9:50,482

a lot of them.

go nuts, more likely or not

through those Outdoor

want to be a survivalist.

366
0:14:23,96 --> 0:14:25,21
I shot--


367
0:14:25,21 --> 0:14:27,45

And the good pile is over
there, you see?

0:14:30,35 --> 0:14:33,8
And when I came out here just
now, I looked over there and I


370
0:14:33,8 --> 0:14:36,53
saw a pair of eyes
looking at us.


371
0:14:36,53 --> 0:14:38,84
I don't know what it was.


372
0:14:38,84 --> 0:14:39,77

0:14:46,2 --> 0:14:47,508
OK, nobody talk.

0:14:47,508 --> 0:14:49,988
Let's all go over there
and get water.

0:14:49,988 --> 0:14:56,114
And if that starts swimming
across the river, then--


380
0:14:56,114 --> 0:14:57,9
tell me.

summer camp vibe going by the

end of night one, but the
monster eyes across the river


388
0:15:21,81 --> 0:15:24,35
served as a good reminder that
we had a lot more to fear out

here than constricted bowels
and shitty cocoa.

eyes, besides me?

You might as well take
it, anyways.


396
0:15:36,59 --> 0:15:38,4
THOMAS MORTON: Being told to
sleep with a loaded shotgun


397
0:15:38,4 --> 0:15:39,65
also didn't help.


398
0:15:39,65 --> 0:15:49,81

of snow last night.

up to a gunshot.

0:15:57,675 --> 0:15:59,66
[GUNSHOT]


403
0:15:59,66 --> 0:16:0,78
THOMAS MORTON: That
was evidently


404
0:16:0,78 --> 0:16:2,68
Heimo popping a squirrel.


405
0:16:2,68 --> 0:16:5,19
I just want to check on the
temperature before we go in.


406
0:16:5,19 --> 0:16:6,21
It's 20 degrees.


407
0:16:6,21 --> 0:16:8,6
I think it's good to point
out how far down these


408
0:16:8,6 --> 0:16:10,96
thermometers go, and that
is to negative 80.


409
0:16:10,96 --> 0:16:13,15
But that shit hopefully
happens months


410
0:16:13,15 --> 0:16:14,58
from now, not tomorrow.


411
0:16:14,58 --> 0:16:17,135



412
0:16:17,135 --> 0:16:19,49
EDNA KORTH: There's a
chair over there.


413
0:16:19,49 --> 0:16:20,432
HEIMO KORTH: Oatmeal?


414
0:16:20,432 --> 0:16:21,99
How's oatmeal today?


415
0:16:21,99 --> 0:16:24,368
THOMAS MORTON: Oatmeal's
great.


416
0:16:24,368 --> 0:16:25,68
[GUNSHOT]


417
0:16:25,68 --> 0:16:26,16
HEIMO KORTH: There you go.


418
0:16:26,16 --> 0:16:28,135
The .22 for grouse and that.


419
0:16:28,135 --> 0:16:28,6
THOMAS MORTON: Yeah.


420
0:16:28,6 --> 0:16:29,22
HEIMO KORTH: You know,
so we can have--


421
0:16:29,22 --> 0:16:29,72
THOMAS MORTON: Shoot
some dinner.


422
0:16:29,72 --> 0:16:30,98
HEIMO KORTH: Yeah,
there you go.


423
0:16:30,98 --> 0:16:31,43
There you go.


424
0:16:31,43 --> 0:16:34,1
Right on.


425
0:16:34,1 --> 0:16:36,89
EDNA KORTH: We do
this every year.


426
0:16:36,89 --> 0:16:41,2
This time of the year, we go
fishing, Arctic grayling, so


427
0:16:41,2 --> 0:16:43,5
we could eat them at
the wintertime.


428
0:16:43,5 --> 0:16:46,47
I went fishing a lot
with my dad.


429
0:16:46,47 --> 0:16:50,21
I'd hunt and trap with him
because I was the oldest.


430
0:16:50,21 --> 0:16:51,89
JOHN MARTIN: Where
did you grow up?


431
0:16:51,89 --> 0:16:53,853
EDNA KORTH: Savoonga,
St. Lawrence Island.


432
0:16:53,853 --> 0:16:56,87



433
0:16:56,87 --> 0:16:59,27
THOMAS MORTON: I mean, you're
following the same route you


434
0:16:59,27 --> 0:17:1,1
normally take?


435
0:17:1,1 --> 0:17:4,196
HEIMO KORTH: After living out
here for 35 years, you just--


436
0:17:4,196 --> 0:17:5,4
you just know.


437
0:17:5,4 --> 0:17:6,939
It's just in you.


438
0:17:6,939 --> 0:17:9,17
A person just has
a sense in him.


439
0:17:9,17 --> 0:17:11,0
You just know where
you're going.


440
0:17:11,0 --> 0:17:12,609
Look at this.


441
0:17:12,609 --> 0:17:15,63
See these big slivers like
that, and this, and that?


442
0:17:15,63 --> 0:17:19,5
This was cut down with a stone
ax, prior to the white man


443
0:17:19,5 --> 0:17:19,97
coming here.


444
0:17:19,97 --> 0:17:23,17
Because there's still stuff
out here like that.


445
0:17:23,17 --> 0:17:25,69
THOMAS MORTON: When'd you
first come to the bush?


446
0:17:25,69 --> 0:17:30,9
EDNA KORTH: In 1982 we got
to the lower cabin.


447
0:17:30,9 --> 0:17:33,11
Heimo has a little tiny
cabin that you could


448
0:17:33,11 --> 0:17:34,76
walk around like this.


449
0:17:34,76 --> 0:17:39,88
I thought to myself, what
am I getting into?


450
0:17:39,88 --> 0:17:44,16
And then, two days later,
I told him, we gotta do


451
0:17:44,16 --> 0:17:48,74
something about the roof because
I'm walking around.


452
0:17:48,74 --> 0:17:51,84
You hold the line, flip it back,
and then as you cast,


453
0:17:51,84 --> 0:17:54,2
you leave go of the line.


454
0:17:54,2 --> 0:17:54,95
THOMAS MORTON: Oh, did I--


455
0:17:54,95 --> 0:17:55,42
shoot.


456
0:17:55,42 --> 0:17:56,3
EDNA KORTH: What?


457
0:17:56,3 --> 0:17:59,87
THOMAS MORTON: I think
I put it in the tree.


458
0:17:59,87 --> 0:18:7,49
[SIGH]


459
0:18:7,49 --> 0:18:7,87
Yeah.


460
0:18:7,87 --> 0:18:10,3
I've been having a
real hard time.


461
0:18:10,3 --> 0:18:13,41
And then you got to remember
it's this again, and again,


462
0:18:13,41 --> 0:18:16,61
and again, and again,
times 50 to 100.


463
0:18:16,61 --> 0:18:18,24
Which is huge.


464
0:18:18,24 --> 0:18:19,49
It's mind-boggling.


465
0:18:19,49 --> 0:18:24,71



466
0:18:24,71 --> 0:18:26,71
HEIMO KORTH: Little smaller
than an Arctic grayling.


467
0:18:26,71 --> 0:18:27,708
Ooh, jeez.


468
0:18:27,708 --> 0:18:28,644
There you go.


469
0:18:28,644 --> 0:18:30,48
Let me get a stick and--


470
0:18:30,48 --> 0:18:32,856



471
0:18:32,856 --> 0:18:34,2
Look how pretty they are.


472
0:18:34,2 --> 0:18:35,88
See the spots on
them like that?


473
0:18:35,88 --> 0:18:37,345
Yellow underneath
there like that?


474
0:18:37,345 --> 0:18:38,59
THOMAS MORTON: Yeah.


475
0:18:38,59 --> 0:18:40,15
Fuck, yeah.


476
0:18:40,15 --> 0:18:41,46
There we go.


477
0:18:41,46 --> 0:18:41,73
Yeah.


478
0:18:41,73 --> 0:18:43,263
EDNA KORTH: All right,
you caught one.


479
0:18:43,263 --> 0:18:44,53
Yay.


480
0:18:44,53 --> 0:18:45,68
HEIMO KORTH: That's
a nice one.


481
0:18:45,68 --> 0:18:46,675
That's a good-sized one, yeah.


482
0:18:46,675 --> 0:18:48,83
Shake it hard.


483
0:18:48,83 --> 0:18:49,895
THOMAS MORTON: Oh, and it
just comes right out.


484
0:18:49,895 --> 0:18:50,35
HEIMO KORTH: Yeah.


485
0:18:50,35 --> 0:18:52,36
THOMAS MORTON: OK.


486
0:18:52,36 --> 0:18:54,45
HEIMO KORTH: Just hold him
like-- no, you're going to


487
0:18:54,45 --> 0:18:55,415
hold him, in case you miss.


488
0:18:55,415 --> 0:18:58,84
I don't want get my
fingers smushed.


489
0:18:58,84 --> 0:19:0,4
Don't hit your fingers,
but hit him hard.


490
0:19:0,4 --> 0:19:1,42
Hard.


491
0:19:1,42 --> 0:19:2,33
Hard, hard, hard.


492
0:19:2,33 --> 0:19:3,33
THOMAS MORTON: Oh, I feel bad.


493
0:19:3,33 --> 0:19:5,235
I feel like I've-- wait,
that did it, right?


494
0:19:5,235 --> 0:19:5,66
HEIMO KORTH: Yeah.


495
0:19:5,66 --> 0:19:6,51
THOMAS MORTON: OK.


496
0:19:6,51 --> 0:19:8,95
HEIMO KORTH: There, see, we've
got a stringer of fish.


497
0:19:8,95 --> 0:19:10,2
Supper tonight.


498
0:19:10,2 --> 0:19:12,25



499
0:19:12,25 --> 0:19:15,9
Fry him up with rice
and salad?


500
0:19:15,9 --> 0:19:15,94
How does that sound?


501
0:19:15,94 --> 0:19:17,19
THOMAS MORTON: Sounds
very good right now.


502
0:19:17,19 --> 0:19:28,0



503
0:19:28,0 --> 0:19:29,41
EDNA KORTH: Well, dig
in, you boys.


504
0:19:29,41 --> 0:19:35,194



505
0:19:35,194 --> 0:19:36,158
HEIMO KORTH: Good fish?


506
0:19:36,158 --> 0:19:37,65
THOMAS MORTON: Oh, it's great.


507
0:19:37,65 --> 0:19:38,9
Hats off.


508
0:19:38,9 --> 0:19:52,85



509
0:19:52,85 --> 0:19:54,6
HEIMO KORTH: We're going
to go hunt caribou.


510
0:19:54,6 --> 0:19:57,17
We're gonna go climb up to a
ridge and we're going to look


511
0:19:57,17 --> 0:19:57,75
for caribou.


512
0:19:57,75 --> 0:19:59,65
And hopefully there'll
be caribou.


513
0:19:59,65 --> 0:20:1,81
And if there are, then we're
shoot a young bull


514
0:20:1,81 --> 0:20:4,39
or else a lone cow.


515
0:20:4,39 --> 0:20:5,701
Then we'll have some
fresh meat.


516
0:20:5,701 --> 0:20:14,48



517
0:20:14,48 --> 0:20:15,4
THOMAS MORTON: Oh, OK.


518
0:20:15,4 --> 0:20:16,34
We're gonna-- this is where
we're gonna hunt from?


519
0:20:16,34 --> 0:20:18,37
HEIMO KORTH: Yeah, this
is a little rock


520
0:20:18,37 --> 0:20:19,59
outcropping right here.


521
0:20:19,59 --> 0:20:20,46
We've got a good view.


522
0:20:20,46 --> 0:20:21,95
You see all the trails
down there?


523
0:20:21,95 --> 0:20:22,18
THOMAS MORTON: Yeah.


524
0:20:22,18 --> 0:20:23,79
HEIMO KORTH: You just keep an
eye on the trail, see if


525
0:20:23,79 --> 0:20:24,85
anything follows them.


526
0:20:24,85 --> 0:20:27,51
If they do, then we go after
them, and that's it.


527
0:20:27,51 --> 0:20:28,76
Then we'll be at it.


528
0:20:28,76 --> 0:20:42,11



529
0:20:42,11 --> 0:20:44,326
This is the my theory
about mankind.


530
0:20:44,326 --> 0:20:46,27
THOMAS MORTON: Mmhm.


531
0:20:46,27 --> 0:20:50,33
HEIMO KORTH: Mankind was much
better off a nomadic hunter.


532
0:20:50,33 --> 0:20:52,71
Once he starts farming,


533
0:20:52,71 --> 0:20:54,91
civilization, it didn't improve.


534
0:20:54,91 --> 0:20:57,466
It went downhill from there.


535
0:20:57,466 --> 0:21:0,79
I mean, when you look at human
beings, how long they've been


536
0:21:0,79 --> 0:21:3,79
on Earth, there were far more
hunters and gatherers than


537
0:21:3,79 --> 0:21:5,4
what they were farmers.


538
0:21:5,4 --> 0:21:9,4



539
0:21:9,4 --> 0:21:12,6
We're out to set some snowshoe
hare snares.


540
0:21:12,6 --> 0:21:14,8
Tomorrow we're going to check
them and hopefully


541
0:21:14,8 --> 0:21:16,946
we'll have a meal.


542
0:21:16,946 --> 0:21:19,7
They used the Earth's
resources too much.


543
0:21:19,7 --> 0:21:20,53
It drained--


544
0:21:20,53 --> 0:21:23,73
I mean, crime increased,
diseases increased.


545
0:21:23,73 --> 0:21:24,98
Life was too easy.


546
0:21:24,98 --> 0:21:29,33



547
0:21:29,33 --> 0:21:30,152
THOMAS MORTON: This
is the snare.


548
0:21:30,152 --> 0:21:31,388
HEIMO KORTH: Yeah.


549
0:21:31,388 --> 0:21:33,3
I kind of blame, like, Europe.


550
0:21:33,3 --> 0:21:35,49
I mean, because everybody in
Europe was a nomadic hunter.


551
0:21:35,49 --> 0:21:39,52
Except I blame the Romans for
coming there and trying to


552
0:21:39,52 --> 0:21:42,88
make people into farmers,
just like them.


553
0:21:42,88 --> 0:21:44,94
There's his tracks underneath
the snare.


554
0:21:44,94 --> 0:21:48,5
You want the snare
right there.


555
0:21:48,5 --> 0:21:50,87
Like in France, the Gauls,
they did that.


556
0:21:50,87 --> 0:21:53,71
And then in Britain, to him,
they conquered them.


557
0:21:53,71 --> 0:21:57,87
And they were all just little
tribes living off the land,


558
0:21:57,87 --> 0:21:59,12
like hunting.


559
0:21:59,12 --> 0:22:1,67
Food was semi-reliable,
so then you bred


560
0:22:1,67 --> 0:22:2,86
more, had more children.


561
0:22:2,86 --> 0:22:6,36
So then the more children,
the more mouths to feed.


562
0:22:6,36 --> 0:22:12,17
People lived closer together,
so in turn, disease came.


563
0:22:12,17 --> 0:22:15,31
See, I'd like it if you
guys catch some, too.


564
0:22:15,31 --> 0:22:17,28
Because then when we eat
it, you'll feel better.


565
0:22:17,28 --> 0:22:17,99
It's a good feeling.


566
0:22:17,99 --> 0:22:20,5
It's better than going to the
store and buying some.


567
0:22:20,5 --> 0:22:22,965
That doesn't give you the same
feeling, you know, if you go


568
0:22:22,965 --> 0:22:24,81
out and hunt it or something.


569
0:22:24,81 --> 0:22:29,74
And now, and now what happened
to the Roman civilization?


570
0:22:29,74 --> 0:22:31,44
THOMAS MORTON: They all
got lead poisoning.


571
0:22:31,44 --> 0:22:33,8
HEIMO KORTH: Yeah, that's
right, they did.


572
0:22:33,8 --> 0:22:37,15



573
0:22:37,15 --> 0:22:39,505
I mean, there is only X amount
of resources on this Earth,


574
0:22:39,505 --> 0:22:43,71
and we're using them up at
an unbelievable rate.


575
0:22:43,71 --> 0:22:46,1
THOMAS MORTON: What
about drilling?


576
0:22:46,1 --> 0:22:46,72
HEIMO KORTH: Oh, I'm not--


577
0:22:46,72 --> 0:22:46,96
THOMAS MORTON: You aren't
really for that, right?


578
0:22:46,96 --> 0:22:48,18
HEIMO KORTH: No, not really.


579
0:22:48,18 --> 0:22:49,38
No, I'm not for that.


580
0:22:49,38 --> 0:22:50,955
THOMAS MORTON: If there was as
much oil in there as there is


581
0:22:50,955 --> 0:22:52,99
in Saudi Arabia, would
you, would you


582
0:22:52,99 --> 0:22:54,89
think it was OK for--?


583
0:22:54,89 --> 0:22:56,62
HEIMO KORTH: If, yeah, but
it isn't like that.


584
0:22:56,62 --> 0:22:58,1
So it's not even
close to that.


585
0:22:58,1 --> 0:22:59,6
It ain't there.


586
0:22:59,6 --> 0:23:2,6
It just ain't there.


587
0:23:2,6 --> 0:23:4,685
So I mean, what are we gonna do
in another 5,000 years, if


588
0:23:4,685 --> 0:23:6,3
we're here?


589
0:23:6,3 --> 0:23:11,14
How much oil is there, if
they're going to be using oil?


590
0:23:11,14 --> 0:23:14,3
And then how many more people
can this Earth feed?


591
0:23:14,3 --> 0:23:15,6
That's another issue.


592
0:23:15,6 --> 0:23:18,72



593
0:23:18,72 --> 0:23:21,7
State opened the beaver season
early now, because there's so


594
0:23:21,7 --> 0:23:23,65
many beaver and hardly anybody's
trapping them.


595
0:23:23,65 --> 0:23:26,23
So we're going to go trap
us some beaver.


596
0:23:26,23 --> 0:23:29,31



597
0:23:29,31 --> 0:23:33,1
I mean, things got really,
really bad in the world over.


598
0:23:33,1 --> 0:23:36,885
Not just in one country,
but the world over.


599
0:23:36,885 --> 0:23:39,19
It's the suburbanites
and the urbanites


600
0:23:39,19 --> 0:23:40,93
that's going to suffer.


601
0:23:40,93 --> 0:23:43,495
The rural people, they're
going to have the food.


602
0:23:43,495 --> 0:23:46,102
And they're going to know
how to get the food.


603
0:23:46,102 --> 0:23:47,352
Not just planting,
but hunting.


604
0:23:47,352 --> 0:23:51,48



605
0:23:51,48 --> 0:23:52,73
THOMAS MORTON: What's
that tree for?


606
0:23:52,73 --> 0:23:56,51



607
0:23:56,51 --> 0:23:57,245
Whoa.


608
0:23:57,245 --> 0:23:58,2
747.


609
0:23:58,2 --> 0:23:59,896
HEIMO KORTH: It has to be.


610
0:23:59,896 --> 0:24:1,784
JOHN MARTIN: Do you like
seeing the planes?


611
0:24:1,784 --> 0:24:2,99
HEIMO KORTH: In some
way, yeah.


612
0:24:2,99 --> 0:24:3,72
Because it's--


613
0:24:3,72 --> 0:24:6,88
even though we got radio, it's
still, it's like, there are


614
0:24:6,88 --> 0:24:7,74
people out there.


615
0:24:7,74 --> 0:24:9,226
You know what I mean?


616
0:24:9,226 --> 0:24:10,92
THOMAS MORTON: It's nice to
have a little contact.


617
0:24:10,92 --> 0:24:11,95
HEIMO KORTH: Yeah.


618
0:24:11,95 --> 0:24:14,8
Like when 9/11 was there, you
know, remember they stopped


619
0:24:14,8 --> 0:24:17,73
all air traffic for a while?


620
0:24:17,73 --> 0:24:20,0
And there was no jets.


621
0:24:20,0 --> 0:24:21,2
Zero.


622
0:24:21,2 --> 0:24:23,2
Nothing.


623
0:24:23,2 --> 0:24:24,82
Almost felt kind of
lonely, you know?


624
0:24:24,82 --> 0:24:27,38
THOMAS MORTON: Did you hear
about 9/11 on the radio?


625
0:24:27,38 --> 0:24:29,3
HEIMO KORTH: Well, I
heard on the radio.


626
0:24:29,3 --> 0:24:31,19
I was like, what?


627
0:24:31,19 --> 0:24:35,7
So you know, but I never have
seen actual footage of the jet


628
0:24:35,7 --> 0:24:35,73
hitting the towers.


629
0:24:35,73 --> 0:24:36,2
THOMAS MORTON: No?


630
0:24:36,2 --> 0:24:38,4
HEIMO KORTH: I've never
seen that in my life.


631
0:24:38,4 --> 0:24:38,51
Never.


632
0:24:38,51 --> 0:24:40,65
Because we were out here,
there's no TV.


633
0:24:40,65 --> 0:24:43,73



634
0:24:43,73 --> 0:24:44,98
OK, first one.


635
0:24:44,98 --> 0:24:46,7
Now watch.


636
0:24:46,7 --> 0:24:48,65
You see the bottom there
and everything?


637
0:24:48,65 --> 0:24:54,572
Just set this down like this,
and push it into the mud good.


638
0:24:54,572 --> 0:24:56,48
OK, that's the first one.


639
0:24:56,48 --> 0:24:58,4
Now we put one more with a bunch
of sticks like this.


640
0:24:58,4 --> 0:25:5,63



641
0:25:5,63 --> 0:25:8,2
That's it.


642
0:25:8,2 --> 0:25:9,66
It's just so vast, huh?


643
0:25:9,66 --> 0:25:12,14
It just goes forever
and ever and ever.


644
0:25:12,14 --> 0:25:16,314
No roads, no trails,
no people, nothing.


645
0:25:16,314 --> 0:25:19,16



646
0:25:19,16 --> 0:25:20,49
THOMAS MORTON: I don't know
whether that's comforting or


647
0:25:20,49 --> 0:25:22,5
terrifying.


648
0:25:22,5 --> 0:25:23,81
HEIMO KORTH: It's comforting
to me, but it


649
0:25:23,81 --> 0:25:25,52
depends the way you're--


650
0:25:25,52 --> 0:25:29,81
everybody feels different
about that, you know?


651
0:25:29,81 --> 0:25:32,98
I feel safe that way.


652
0:25:32,98 --> 0:25:34,23
I feel safe.


653
0:25:34,23 --> 0:25:51,606



654
0:25:51,606 --> 0:25:55,4
Have you checked [INAUDIBLE]
mountain?


655
0:25:55,4 --> 0:25:57,76
Goroy Mountain?


656
0:25:57,76 --> 0:25:58,27
Let me have the binoculars.


657
0:25:58,27 --> 0:26:0,824
Let me look over there
on them mountains.


658
0:26:0,824 --> 0:26:8,41



659
0:26:8,41 --> 0:26:11,2
THOMAS MORTON: Heimo just saw a
bunch of caribou coming down


660
0:26:11,2 --> 0:26:14,74
off the ridge, so we're going to
go up on the tundra and try


661
0:26:14,74 --> 0:26:16,19
to head them off.


662
0:26:16,19 --> 0:26:19,1
This is the Korths' last chance
to get some meat.


663
0:26:19,1 --> 0:26:21,2
They're well stocked.


664
0:26:21,2 --> 0:26:24,63
They could survive without it,
but you know, it would be nice


665
0:26:24,63 --> 0:26:27,41
for them before the herd
heads off, if they


666
0:26:27,41 --> 0:26:28,66
could take one more.


667
0:26:28,66 --> 0:26:31,6



668
0:26:31,6 --> 0:26:33,24
HEIMO KORTH (WHISPERING): If
something scared them, yeah.


669
0:26:33,24 --> 0:26:38,16
If they ran into
a wolf or bear.


670
0:26:38,16 --> 0:26:39,97
Shit.


671
0:26:39,97 --> 0:26:41,8
Yeah, oh, yeah.


672
0:26:41,8 --> 0:26:41,976
Oh yes.


673
0:26:41,976 --> 0:26:44,22
Damn.


674
0:26:44,22 --> 0:26:47,94
Well, when they came out,
they cut that way.


675
0:26:47,94 --> 0:26:48,9
That's--


676
0:26:48,9 --> 0:26:50,66
no caribou today yet.


677
0:26:50,66 --> 0:26:51,59
Maybe on the way home.


678
0:26:51,59 --> 0:26:52,28
Who knows?


679
0:26:52,28 --> 0:26:54,416
We'll find out.


680
0:26:54,416 --> 0:26:55,666
Just keep trudging along.


681
0:26:55,666 --> 0:27:3,27



682
0:27:3,27 --> 0:27:5,15
Something killed a calf
caribou here.


683
0:27:5,15 --> 0:27:6,85
Either wolf-- wolverine--
or bear.


684
0:27:6,85 --> 0:27:7,71
One of the two.


685
0:27:7,71 --> 0:27:11,0
THOMAS MORTON: Oh, yeah,
look at all that fur.


686
0:27:11,0 --> 0:27:13,67
HEIMO KORTH: The bones, see the
pelvis bone, the back one?


687
0:27:13,67 --> 0:27:14,63
THOMAS MORTON: How long
ago, do you think?


688
0:27:14,63 --> 0:27:15,44
HEIMO KORTH: Oh, I don't know.


689
0:27:15,44 --> 0:27:16,745
That was probably when we--


690
0:27:16,745 --> 0:27:18,41
when all them caribou
came through


691
0:27:18,41 --> 0:27:20,386
in the end of September.


692
0:27:20,386 --> 0:27:21,16
THOMAS MORTON: Ooh.


693
0:27:21,16 --> 0:27:22,41
Grisly.


694
0:27:22,41 --> 0:27:26,25



695
0:27:26,25 --> 0:27:28,97
[DOG BARKING]


696
0:27:28,97 --> 0:27:30,22
HEIMO KORTH: Let
me get the saw.


697
0:27:30,22 --> 0:27:38,42



698
0:27:38,42 --> 0:27:40,245
See all the eggs in there?


699
0:27:40,245 --> 0:27:41,495
Full of eggs.


700
0:27:41,495 --> 0:27:47,458

0:27:47,458 --> 0:28:11,81
[GENERATOR MOTOR]


702
0:28:11,81 --> 0:28:14,61
HEIMO KORTH: Oh, that's out
here, east somewhere.


703
0:28:14,61 --> 0:28:16,79
I'm into movies somewhat,
you know?


704
0:28:16,79 --> 0:28:19,67
I like the sci-fi movies,
you know, like aliens


705
0:28:19,67 --> 0:28:20,52
and stuff like that.


706
0:28:20,52 --> 0:28:23,1
I like stuff like that.


707
0:28:23,1 --> 0:28:26,185
Transporter, Born in East
LA, Addams Family.


708
0:28:26,185 --> 0:28:27,57
Munich takes a long time.


709
0:28:27,57 --> 0:28:30,6
That's like almost a
three-hour movie.


710
0:28:30,6 --> 0:28:31,35
JOHN MARTIN: Predator
or whatever.


711
0:28:31,35 --> 0:28:32,92
THOMAS MORTON: That night after
looking through family


712
0:28:32,92 --> 0:28:34,58
photos on Edna's gas-powered
laptop--


713
0:28:34,58 --> 0:28:35,66
HEIMO KORTH: We'll
watch this one.


714
0:28:35,66 --> 0:28:37,8
THOMAS MORTON: Heimo treated
us to a special


715
0:28:37,8 --> 0:28:39,79
screening of Predator.


716
0:28:39,79 --> 0:28:42,64
The irony of watching Major Alan
"Dutch" Schaefer try to


717
0:28:42,64 --> 0:28:45,53
trap and kill Predator in the
company of a fur trapper did


718
0:28:45,53 --> 0:28:47,43
not escape us.


719
0:28:47,43 --> 0:28:50,5
Nor did Heimo waste any
opportunity to point out when


720
0:28:50,5 --> 0:28:52,69
and how Schwarzenegger's various
Predator traps were


721
0:28:52,69 --> 0:28:54,8
total bullshit.


722
0:28:54,8 --> 0:28:57,0
At this point, it was very easy
to forget that we were on


723
0:28:57,0 --> 0:28:59,71
the furthest brink of human
civilization and not just


724
0:28:59,71 --> 0:29:2,5
sprawled out on a friend's
couch, basking in the glow of


725
0:29:2,5 --> 0:29:3,3
a TBS staple.


726
0:29:3,3 --> 0:29:15,82



727
0:29:15,82 --> 0:29:18,696
Apparently there were bear
tracks near where the outhouse


728
0:29:18,696 --> 0:29:21,27
is. (SOFTLY) What the
fuck are they doing?


729
0:29:21,27 --> 0:29:23,65
The next morning, our feelings
of suburban safety and


730
0:29:23,65 --> 0:29:26,28
contentment were vanquished for
good by the discovery of


731
0:29:26,28 --> 0:29:27,75
bear tracks near the cabin.


732
0:29:27,75 --> 0:29:31,26
JOHN MARTIN: Here
they come again.


733
0:29:31,26 --> 0:29:32,37
HEIMO KORTH: Good morning.


734
0:29:32,37 --> 0:29:33,64
THOMAS MORTON: Good morning?


735
0:29:33,64 --> 0:29:35,23
HEIMO KORTH: We'll show you.


736
0:29:35,23 --> 0:29:37,32
JOHN MARTIN: See, you went
to find the tracks?


737
0:29:37,32 --> 0:29:37,736
HEIMO KORTH: Yeah.


738
0:29:37,736 --> 0:29:38,568
We'll--


739
0:29:38,568 --> 0:29:39,86
we'll have to show you.


740
0:29:39,86 --> 0:29:40,61
We gotta get rid of him.


741
0:29:40,61 --> 0:29:43,3
Because otherwise he's going
to wreck your tents and


742
0:29:43,3 --> 0:29:44,253
everything.


743
0:29:44,253 --> 0:29:49,406



744
0:29:49,406 --> 0:29:51,56
HEIMO KORTH (WHISPERING):
He came to right there.


745
0:29:51,56 --> 0:29:54,458
That's the track, yeah.


746
0:29:54,458 --> 0:29:58,36
Those paws are enormous.


747
0:29:58,36 --> 0:29:59,64
THOMAS MORTON: This is the time
of year that bears are


748
0:29:59,64 --> 0:30:1,74
putting on their last few
pounds before going into


749
0:30:1,74 --> 0:30:3,3
hibernation.


750
0:30:3,3 --> 0:30:5,44
And Heimo guaranteed us that
our nocturnal visitor would


751
0:30:5,44 --> 0:30:8,8
not only be returning soon but
would continue to do so until


752
0:30:8,8 --> 0:30:11,23
either it was dead or we were.


753
0:30:11,23 --> 0:30:12,89
HEIMO KORTH: See where he
scraped the ground to cover


754
0:30:12,89 --> 0:30:14,5
the carcass?


755
0:30:14,5 --> 0:30:15,14
THOMAS MORTON (WHISPERING):
Where's the carcass?


756
0:30:15,14 --> 0:30:16,4
HEIMO KORTH (WHISPERING):
Under all that.


757
0:30:16,4 --> 0:30:16,92
He covers it.


758
0:30:16,92 --> 0:30:18,321
THOMAS MORTON (WHISPERING):
He's probably nearby?


759
0:30:18,321 --> 0:30:21,123
HEIMO KORTH: Mmhm.


760
0:30:21,123 --> 0:30:23,162
And guaranteed to attack us.


761
0:30:23,162 --> 0:30:25,13
If he comes behind us,
I want you to duck


762
0:30:25,13 --> 0:30:26,7
down like that, so--


763
0:30:26,7 --> 0:30:28,91
'cause I'm going to
shoot over you.


764
0:30:28,91 --> 0:30:29,67
[WHISTLE]


765
0:30:29,67 --> 0:30:31,534
Hey, bear.


766
0:30:31,534 --> 0:30:32,52
Hey.


767
0:30:32,52 --> 0:30:33,77

0:30:33,77 --> 0:30:44,8



769
0:30:44,8 --> 0:30:46,285
HEIMO KORTH: Pretty spooky
back there, huh?


770
0:30:46,285 --> 0:30:47,6
THOMAS MORTON: Yeah.


771
0:30:47,6 --> 0:30:48,58
Just with the carcass, and--


772
0:30:48,58 --> 0:30:50,38
so is he eating the other
bear carcass?


773
0:30:50,38 --> 0:30:51,18
HEIMO KORTH: Oh, yeah.


774
0:30:51,18 --> 0:30:52,3
They do that all the time.


775
0:30:52,3 --> 0:30:54,11
One bear'll eat another
bear carcass.


776
0:30:54,11 --> 0:30:55,47
THOMAS MORTON: No manners
amongst bears.


777
0:30:55,47 --> 0:30:58,13
HEIMO KORTH: Well, remember he
raked it all in and covered


778
0:30:58,13 --> 0:30:58,88
the carcass like that?


779
0:30:58,88 --> 0:31:0,39
THOMAS MORTON: Oh, you got
to see the carcass.


780
0:31:0,39 --> 0:31:2,715
All our farcical bear alarm
jokes from earlier in the week


781
0:31:2,715 --> 0:31:6,61
were revisited, but this
time in deadly earnest.


782
0:31:6,61 --> 0:31:9,35
If we so much as needed to shit,
we had to take a shotgun


783
0:31:9,35 --> 0:31:11,29
with us and establish that
we were in clear shouting


784
0:31:11,29 --> 0:31:12,905
distance of someone else.


785
0:31:12,905 --> 0:31:15,16
JOHN MCSHANE: Apparently there
were bear tracks near where


786
0:31:15,16 --> 0:31:16,5
the outhouse is.


787
0:31:16,5 --> 0:31:17,72
I've been told to carry
this with me.


788
0:31:17,72 --> 0:31:19,55
EDNA KORTH: Don't
shoot this way.


789
0:31:19,55 --> 0:31:20,3
JOHN MCSHANE: Right.


790
0:31:20,3 --> 0:31:21,284
EDNA KORTH: If you see
him on that side,


791
0:31:21,284 --> 0:31:22,54
shoot at him that way.


792
0:31:22,54 --> 0:31:23,19
JOHN MCSHANE: Right.


793
0:31:23,19 --> 0:31:24,47
And a killing shot is where?


794
0:31:24,47 --> 0:31:25,51
Like head or the heart?


795
0:31:25,51 --> 0:31:26,2
EDNA KORTH: In the chest.


796
0:31:26,2 --> 0:31:26,76
JOHN MCSHANE: Chest?


797
0:31:26,76 --> 0:31:28,1
EDNA KORTH: Yeah.


798
0:31:28,1 --> 0:31:36,11



799
0:31:36,11 --> 0:31:37,14
JOHN MARTIN: Good luck.


800
0:31:37,14 --> 0:31:38,39
JOHN MCSHANE: Thanks.


801
0:31:38,39 --> 0:31:41,8



802
0:31:41,8 --> 0:31:44,6
THOMAS MORTON: So we're eating
moose tacos tonight?


803
0:31:44,6 --> 0:31:45,86
EDNA KORTH: Yeah.


804
0:31:45,86 --> 0:31:47,11
THOMAS MORTON: Taco night.


805
0:31:47,11 --> 0:31:50,6
EDNA KORTH: Heimo's favorite.


806
0:31:50,6 --> 0:31:53,42
Usually I'll just have two
taco shells tonight, and


807
0:31:53,42 --> 0:31:56,45
there's 10 or 12 in a box.


808
0:31:56,45 --> 0:31:57,693
He'll eat the rest.


809
0:31:57,693 --> 0:31:59,874
THOMAS MORTON: Do your
daughters eat a lot?


810
0:31:59,874 --> 0:32:0,306
EDNA KORTH: Yeah.


811
0:32:0,306 --> 0:32:1,7
THOMAS MORTON: Were you worried
when they were little


812
0:32:1,7 --> 0:32:3,59
about bringing them
up out here?


813
0:32:3,59 --> 0:32:4,8
EDNA KORTH: Oh, no.


814
0:32:4,8 --> 0:32:4,56
THOMAS MORTON: No?


815
0:32:4,56 --> 0:32:6,96
EDNA KORTH: Uh-uh.


816
0:32:6,96 --> 0:32:10,954
I taught them from since
they were five.


817
0:32:10,954 --> 0:32:13,14
THOMAS MORTON: Heimo told me
they went to boarding school


818
0:32:13,14 --> 0:32:14,58
for a couple years.


819
0:32:14,58 --> 0:32:15,2
EDNA KORTH: Yeah.


820
0:32:15,2 --> 0:32:18,11
Both of the girls did,
because I think it's


821
0:32:18,11 --> 0:32:20,7
time for them to move.


822
0:32:20,7 --> 0:32:21,58
I didn't want--


823
0:32:21,58 --> 0:32:25,2
I told him I didn't want to
teach them anymore because I


824
0:32:25,2 --> 0:32:30,54
don't want to do high
school again.


825
0:32:30,54 --> 0:32:32,4
There.


826
0:32:32,4 --> 0:32:33,89
We just opened it.


827
0:32:33,89 --> 0:32:35,84
It's too hot.


828
0:32:35,84 --> 0:32:37,72
HEIMO KORTH: It's too cold.


829
0:32:37,72 --> 0:32:40,25
The first taco I ever had,
it's like, I fell


830
0:32:40,25 --> 0:32:41,15
in love with it.


831
0:32:41,15 --> 0:32:43,56
Man, what have I been missing
all these years?


832
0:32:43,56 --> 0:32:44,51
Oh, it was good.


833
0:32:44,51 --> 0:32:45,77
Ooh, I loved it.


834
0:32:45,77 --> 0:32:47,702
Any kind of Mexican food,
I had to come to


835
0:32:47,702 --> 0:32:49,2
Alaska to have it first.


836
0:32:49,2 --> 0:32:51,52
Alaska.


837
0:32:51,52 --> 0:32:52,75
This year's exceptionally
weird.


838
0:32:52,75 --> 0:32:54,4
It really is.


839
0:32:54,4 --> 0:32:56,12
This is the third time
a neighbor come in.


840
0:32:56,12 --> 0:32:57,2
THOMAS MORTON: I
think that is.


841
0:32:57,2 --> 0:32:58,565
There more of them?


842
0:32:58,565 --> 0:32:59,265
HEIMO KORTH: I think so.


843
0:32:59,265 --> 0:33:0,92
I think so.


844
0:33:0,92 --> 0:33:2,5
Until everything's resolved,
we're going to


845
0:33:2,5 --> 0:33:5,54
have to stick close.


846
0:33:5,54 --> 0:33:7,27
THOMAS MORTON: What'll
it sound like?


847
0:33:7,27 --> 0:33:11,77
HEIMO KORTH: The dog'll tell
us in a heartbeat.


848
0:33:11,77 --> 0:33:18,55
Me and Edna, and you and you,
we're gonna have to boogie out


849
0:33:18,55 --> 0:33:21,851
real quick and take
care of it.


850
0:33:21,851 --> 0:33:24,532
EDNA KORTH: I'll be
the last person.


851
0:33:24,532 --> 0:33:26,58
HEIMO KORTH: You're gonna
be right with us.


852
0:33:26,58 --> 0:33:29,13
'Cause you and me'll
be in the lead.


853
0:33:29,13 --> 0:33:31,84
Especially you.


854
0:33:31,84 --> 0:33:33,9
You'll be--


855
0:33:33,9 --> 0:33:39,13



856
0:33:39,13 --> 0:33:40,754
THOMAS MORTON: Heimo just
heard the dog bark.

0:33:42,23 --> 0:33:46,61

have gotten our visitor.

861
0:33:50,894 --> 0:33:51,7
This is serious.


862
0:33:51,7 --> 0:33:52,907
He's there.


863
0:33:52,907 --> 0:33:54,4
EDNA KORTH: Somebody else--


864
0:33:54,4 --> 0:33:55,44
HEIMO KORTH: No, I
need you, Mom.


865
0:33:55,44 --> 0:33:56,2
Let's go.


866
0:33:56,2 --> 0:33:56,44
Come on, let's go.

0:33:56,44 --> 0:33:58,41

868
0:33:58,41 --> 0:33:59,57
Extra shells.


869
0:33:59,57 --> 0:34:2,81
Hey, John, in that box
up there, wooden box.


870
0:34:2,81 --> 0:34:4,11
Reach for some--


871
0:34:4,11 --> 0:34:5,22
pack of shotgun shells.


872
0:34:5,22 --> 0:34:7,6
There are five in there.


873
0:34:7,6 --> 0:34:7,45
OK?


874
0:34:7,45 --> 0:34:9,38
When we walk up there, quiet.


875
0:34:9,38 --> 0:34:10,59
Nobody talk.

me, Mr. Korth.


879
0:34:21,34 --> 0:34:23,621
HEIMO KORTH: Don't get upset.


880
0:34:23,621 --> 0:34:25,585

just got dark.

0:34:25,585 --> 0:34:29,513

like the bear's moving.

HEIMO KORTH: Hey, you guys--


906
0:35:15,94 --> 0:35:16,1
THOMAS MORTON: He's dead?


907
0:35:16,1 --> 0:35:16,76
Can we come?


908
0:35:16,76 --> 0:35:18,1
JOHN MCSHANE: We're good?

0:35:18,1 --> 0:35:20,555



910
0:35:20,555 --> 0:35:22,52
THOMAS MORTON: We can
shit in peace.


911
0:35:22,52 --> 0:35:25,8
The uh, the bear is dead.


912
0:35:25,8 --> 0:35:27,7
HEIMO KORTH: Imagine if you
got attacked by that.


913
0:35:27,7 --> 0:35:28,29
JOHN MARTIN: Fuck.


914
0:35:28,29 --> 0:35:30,28
THOMAS MORTON: Was he on all
fours, or was he up high?


915
0:35:30,28 --> 0:35:31,78
HEIMO KORTH: He was all fours.


916
0:35:31,78 --> 0:35:32,51
THOMAS MORTON: OK.


917
0:35:32,51 --> 0:35:33,81
HEIMO KORTH: All fours,
and then--


918
0:35:33,81 --> 0:35:34,867
THOMAS MORTON: That makes
it harder to shoot


919
0:35:34,867 --> 0:35:35,43
him, doesn't it?


920
0:35:35,43 --> 0:35:37,23
HEIMO KORTH: Once he was hit, he
was rolling around all over


921
0:35:37,23 --> 0:35:39,38
just like a ball, and
that was even worse.


922
0:35:39,38 --> 0:35:40,4
THOMAS MORTON: That's
terrifying.


923
0:35:40,4 --> 0:35:41,74
HEIMO KORTH: To try
to shoot him.


924
0:35:41,74 --> 0:35:43,56
THOMAS MORTON (SHIVERING)
Ayyyy, hey, hey.


925
0:35:43,56 --> 0:35:44,92
HEIMO KORTH: That could
take a chunk


926
0:35:44,92 --> 0:35:45,54
out of you in a heartbeat.


927
0:35:45,54 --> 0:35:46,63
THOMAS MORTON: Yes.


928
0:35:46,63 --> 0:35:49,43
HEIMO KORTH: It was so dark
that we kept shooting and


929
0:35:49,43 --> 0:35:50,3
shooting and shooting.


930
0:35:50,3 --> 0:35:53,43
And I know I missed a bunch
because I couldn't see the


931
0:35:53,43 --> 0:35:55,6
bear in the sights of my gun.


932
0:35:55,6 --> 0:35:58,65
The dog knew there was something
amiss, and then I


933
0:35:58,65 --> 0:36:1,81
could hear the bear
back in there.


934
0:36:1,81 --> 0:36:3,52
And that's when I ran
in the house and


935
0:36:3,52 --> 0:36:5,11
got Edna and everybody.


936
0:36:5,11 --> 0:36:6,32
Come on, we gotta go.


937
0:36:6,32 --> 0:36:9,64
I couldn't see the bear in
the sights of my gun.


938
0:36:9,64 --> 0:36:11,215
And as you saw, it
was a big bear.


939
0:36:11,215 --> 0:36:12,48
It was a really big bear.


940
0:36:12,48 --> 0:36:16,22
And he's gone, and--


941
0:36:16,22 --> 0:36:18,14
HEIMO KORTH: And we
protected our--


942
0:36:18,14 --> 0:36:19,15
I mean, us.


943
0:36:19,15 --> 0:36:19,73
And property.


944
0:36:19,73 --> 0:36:21,7
Otherwise he might have
killed the dog.


945
0:36:21,7 --> 0:36:23,19
So we lost a dog already.


946
0:36:23,19 --> 0:36:26,44
A bear came in the yard and ate
the dog alive, you know?


947
0:36:26,44 --> 0:36:27,84
And that was pretty sad.


948
0:36:27,84 --> 0:36:29,485
That's, you know, that's
life in the Arctic.


949
0:36:29,485 --> 0:36:30,4

950
0:36:30,4 --> 0:36:32,836

the way it goes.

be sleeping good tonight.

0:36:43,12 --> 0:36:44,1

956
0:36:44,1 --> 0:36:51,41

uncertain which one.

0:36:51,41 --> 0:36:53,36
I've got--


958
0:36:53,36 --> 0:36:55,45
I've got no clue what day
of the week it is,


959
0:36:55,45 --> 0:36:58,96
either, I just realized.


960
0:36:58,96 --> 0:37:0,94
HEIMO KORTH: Don't
fall on 'em.


961
0:37:0,94 --> 0:37:2,373
Lot of air bubbles, huh?


962
0:37:2,373 --> 0:37:8,3

0:37:8,3 --> 0:37:10,88
THOMAS MORTON: How
are we looking?


964
0:37:10,88 --> 0:37:12,48
HEIMO KORTH: Situation
looks quite bleak.


965
0:37:12,48 --> 0:37:15,19
THOMAS MORTON: Oh.


966
0:37:15,19 --> 0:37:18,36
HEIMO KORTH: Maybe
in the morning.


967
0:37:18,36 --> 0:37:21,172
We'll just come here in the
morning and see what's there.


968
0:37:21,172 --> 0:37:22,46
Just have to do that.


969
0:37:22,46 --> 0:37:25,21



970
0:37:25,21 --> 0:37:27,6
THOMAS MORTON: Gotta go deal
with that bear right now.


971
0:37:27,6 --> 0:37:28,8
It's just, like, lying there
in the middle of the trail.


972
0:37:28,8 --> 0:37:34,8
We're gonna have to skin it,
de-skull it, and do something


973
0:37:34,8 --> 0:37:38,65
with the meat that doesn't
involve leaving it for another


974
0:37:38,65 --> 0:37:41,192
bear to come and try to eat.


975
0:37:41,192 --> 0:37:42,97
There's the bear.


976
0:37:42,97 --> 0:37:44,29
Still dead?


977
0:37:44,29 --> 0:37:46,58
HEIMO KORTH (WHISPERING):
Oh, yeah.


978
0:37:46,58 --> 0:37:49,64
I wouldn't want to fool
with a bear like this.


979
0:37:49,64 --> 0:37:51,74
Because you'd be in
deep doo-doo.


980
0:37:51,74 --> 0:37:52,17
Stinks.


981
0:37:52,17 --> 0:37:54,66
Whew.


982
0:37:54,66 --> 0:37:55,85
His belly was full.


983
0:37:55,85 --> 0:37:56,94
So he stinks pretty bad.

He-- ho, ho. (GAGGING)
Ho, oh, oh, huh, ho.


990
0:38:9,91 --> 0:38:10,89
Oh, no.


991
0:38:10,89 --> 0:38:11,88
Oh, god.


992
0:38:11,88 --> 0:38:13,5
Oh, that's-- oh.


993
0:38:13,5 --> 0:38:14,23
HEIMO KORTH: Terrible, huh?


994
0:38:14,23 --> 0:38:15,36
You get a good whiff
of that, huh?


995
0:38:15,36 --> 0:38:17,6
THOMAS MORTON: Oh,
I got plenty.


996
0:38:17,6 --> 0:38:19,89
He basically just deflated.


997
0:38:19,89 --> 0:38:21,57
And that air.


998
0:38:21,57 --> 0:38:22,3
Oh my god.


999
0:38:22,3 --> 0:38:23,63
HEIMO KORTH: Pretty rank, huh?


1000
0:38:23,63 --> 0:38:24,263
THOMAS MORTON: That was--
that was some, that


1001
0:38:24,263 --> 0:38:25,4
was some rank air.


1002
0:38:25,4 --> 0:38:25,98
That was--


1003
0:38:25,98 --> 0:38:26,265
HEIMO KORTH: OK.


1004
0:38:26,265 --> 0:38:27,73
THOMAS MORTON: That was worse
than anything I'm going to do


1005
0:38:27,73 --> 0:38:29,11
on this trip.


1006
0:38:29,11 --> 0:38:31,31
Is this gonna happen
again, now?


1007
0:38:31,31 --> 0:38:32,59
HEIMO KORTH: Yeah, he's
kind of, kind of


1008
0:38:32,59 --> 0:38:33,43
rigor mortis in here.


1009
0:38:33,43 --> 0:38:34,68
THOMAS MORTON: Ohh.


1010
0:38:34,68 --> 0:38:37,624



1011
0:38:37,624 --> 0:38:39,35
Ohh.


1012
0:38:39,35 --> 0:38:40,396
HEIMO KORTH: You smell?


1013
0:38:40,396 --> 0:38:40,872
THOMAS MORTON: Yeah.


1014
0:38:40,872 --> 0:38:42,3
Oh, oh.


1015
0:38:42,3 --> 0:38:44,48
HEIMO KORTH: I could use
somebody else to help, too.


1016
0:38:44,48 --> 0:38:46,7
You guys spread the arms, OK?


1017
0:38:46,7 --> 0:38:47,95
Watch your fingers.


1018
0:38:47,95 --> 0:38:50,1



1019
0:38:50,1 --> 0:38:53,13
I learned this from a hunting
guy that I worked for.


1020
0:38:53,13 --> 0:38:55,37
He taught me how
to skin bears.


1021
0:38:55,37 --> 0:38:56,68
Without him, I wouldn't
be up here.


1022
0:38:56,68 --> 0:39:1,65
He's the one that offered me the
job, so I moved up here.


1023
0:39:1,65 --> 0:39:4,29



1024
0:39:4,29 --> 0:39:4,79
OK.


1025
0:39:4,79 --> 0:39:5,48
Now.


1026
0:39:5,48 --> 0:39:7,13
Bend down hard, hard.


1027
0:39:7,13 --> 0:39:7,46
Real hard.

[SNAPPING BONE]

0:39:7,93 --> 0:39:10,29
HEIMO KORTH: There you go,
that's what we needed.


1030
0:39:10,29 --> 0:39:14,31
Now, put on a pair of rubber
gloves because you're going to


1031
0:39:14,31 --> 0:39:15,61
grab the meat now.


1032
0:39:15,61 --> 0:39:17,435
I mean, this is more
than one slug.


1033
0:39:17,435 --> 0:39:20,23
And right here, look at that.


1034
0:39:20,23 --> 0:39:23,3
You see what I'm saying?


1035
0:39:23,3 --> 0:39:26,23
Like I feel like a lot of people
would see this and just


1036
0:39:26,23 --> 0:39:28,29
automatically be like, this
guy must hate animals.


1037
0:39:28,29 --> 0:39:29,84
HEIMO KORTH: No, I don't
hate animals.


1038
0:39:29,84 --> 0:39:31,42
Not in the least.


1039
0:39:31,42 --> 0:39:33,6
Because I want to see them
here all the time.


1040
0:39:33,6 --> 0:39:34,67
I do.


1041
0:39:34,67 --> 0:39:35,95

live among them.

0:39:40,97 --> 0:39:47,62



1046
0:39:47,62 --> 0:39:49,52
Hold that leg, grab this one.


1047
0:39:49,52 --> 0:39:50,61
You and me--


1048
0:39:50,61 --> 0:39:52,55
you and me, Thomas,
pull this one.


1049
0:39:52,55 --> 0:39:53,27
You gotta lift it up.


1050
0:39:53,27 --> 0:39:54,18
It's gonna be hard.


1051
0:39:54,18 --> 0:39:55,3
One, two, three.

0:39:55,3 --> 0:39:57,65
There we go, there we
go, there we go.


1053
0:39:57,65 --> 0:40:0,9
Just like this.


1054
0:40:0,9 --> 0:40:0,62
OK.


1055
0:40:0,62 --> 0:40:1,55
Tell you what.


1056
0:40:1,55 --> 0:40:4,24
To keep that clean, fold
that there like that.


1057
0:40:4,24 --> 0:40:4,85
That's good.


1058
0:40:4,85 --> 0:40:5,92
There we go.


1059
0:40:5,92 --> 0:40:7,445

the nose and--


1060
0:40:7,445 --> 0:40:8,1
no, really.


1061
0:40:8,1 --> 0:40:9,8
Can you do it?


1062
0:40:9,8 --> 0:40:9,533
THOMAS MORTON: Yeah.


1063
0:40:9,533 --> 0:40:11,8
Oh, that feels kind of odd.


1064
0:40:11,8 --> 0:40:12,625
HEIMO KORTH: Now, OK.


1065
0:40:12,625 --> 0:40:13,875
Now.


1066
0:40:13,875 --> 0:40:17,9



1067
0:40:17,9 --> 0:40:18,26
THOMAS MORTON: Oh,
there's the ears.


1068
0:40:18,26 --> 0:40:18,9
There's the eye holes.


1069
0:40:18,9 --> 0:40:20,32
HEIMO KORTH: There you go.


1070
0:40:20,32 --> 0:40:21,95
THOMAS MORTON: There's
our bear.


1071
0:40:21,95 --> 0:40:22,97
HEIMO KORTH: I gotta
cut that skull off.


1072
0:40:22,97 --> 0:40:25,27
The skull has to be brought
to the Alaska

0:40:25,27 --> 0:40:26,55
Department of Fish and Game.


1074
0:40:26,55 --> 0:40:29,2
I mushed up the skull bad.


1075
0:40:29,2 --> 0:40:29,55
Ooh.


1076
0:40:29,55 --> 0:40:32,77

shots that are gonna give me


1077
0:40:32,77 --> 0:40:34,2

HEIMO KORTH: It's not
so bloody this way,


1080
0:40:41,75 --> 0:40:43,0
you know what I mean?


1081
0:40:43,0 --> 0:40:47,63



1082
0:40:47,63 --> 0:40:48,88
OK, push it down like this.


1083
0:40:48,88 --> 0:40:52,54



1084
0:40:52,54 --> 0:40:52,99
OK.


1085
0:40:52,99 --> 0:40:53,75
There.


1086
0:40:53,75 --> 0:40:57,79
One, two, three.


1087
0:40:57,79 --> 0:41:1,25
Once we get on the snow,
it'll be easier.


1088
0:41:1,25 --> 0:41:3,5

HEIMO KORTH: To there.


1092
0:41:12,2 --> 0:41:14,23



1093
0:41:14,23 --> 0:41:16,905
That's good.


1094
0:41:16,905 --> 0:41:18,155
OK.


1095
0:41:18,155 --> 0:41:20,79



1096
0:41:20,79 --> 0:41:24,86
Well, let's go check snares.


1097
0:41:24,86 --> 0:41:26,4

getting really busy with


1098
0:41:26,4 --> 0:41:26,83
the trapping?


1099
0:41:26,83 --> 0:41:27,99
Like when does that kick in?


1100
0:41:27,99 --> 0:41:28,65
HEIMO KORTH: November.


1101
0:41:28,65 --> 0:41:29,596
THOMAS MORTON: November?


1102
0:41:29,596 --> 0:41:31,66
And how long does it last?


1103
0:41:31,66 --> 0:41:33,78
HEIMO KORTH: Until March,
I'll be really busy,


1104
0:41:33,78 --> 0:41:35,99
trapping every day.


1105
0:41:35,99 --> 0:41:37,41
Nothing?


1106
0:41:37,41 --> 0:41:38,59
First one empty.


1107
0:41:38,59 --> 0:41:38,85
See it?


1108
0:41:38,85 --> 0:41:40,8
Right down here.


1109
0:41:40,8 --> 0:41:42,68
See the snare you set there?


1110
0:41:42,68 --> 0:41:43,93
David's is empty.


1111
0:41:43,93 --> 0:41:47,458



1112
0:41:47,458 --> 0:41:48,4
Ooh.


1113
0:41:48,4 --> 0:41:51,72
Too much fox and wolverine
hanging around.


1114
0:41:51,72 --> 0:41:52,57
THOMAS MORTON: So that's
why we don't have--


1115
0:41:52,57 --> 0:41:54,4
HEIMO KORTH: That's why the
bunnies-- you know, they


1116
0:41:54,4 --> 0:41:56,99
either killed 'em, or else the
bunnies took off to Timbuktu.


1117
0:41:56,99 --> 0:41:58,6
Because they ain't gonna stand
around with all these


1118
0:41:58,6 --> 0:42:1,36
wolverines and foxes around.


1119
0:42:1,36 --> 0:42:2,63
Who set this one?


1120
0:42:2,63 --> 0:42:4,88
THOMAS MORTON: Um, maybe me?


1121
0:42:4,88 --> 0:42:6,29
HEIMO KORTH: You got a bunny.


1122
0:42:6,29 --> 0:42:7,845
There's part of supper.


1123
0:42:7,845 --> 0:42:9,35

1124
0:42:9,35 --> 0:42:12,39
These things are really big.


1125
0:42:12,39 --> 0:42:13,26
Wow.


1126
0:42:13,26 --> 0:42:15,9
I snared my first bunny.


1127
0:42:15,9 --> 0:42:16,56
HEIMO KORTH: Yeah.


1128
0:42:16,56 --> 0:42:18,7
THOMAS MORTON: Oh, I'm sorry
it was a struggle, but I'm


1129
0:42:18,7 --> 0:42:19,88
happy we have food.


1130
0:42:19,88 --> 0:42:23,43
HEIMO KORTH: Christ, see, this
guy, he caught a fish, and he


1131
0:42:23,43 --> 0:42:25,38
got a bunny.


1132
0:42:25,38 --> 0:42:27,14

bunny, but it's alive.


1133
0:42:27,14 --> 0:42:30,58



1134
0:42:30,58 --> 0:42:31,8
How are--


1135
0:42:31,8 --> 0:42:33,78
how are you going to dispatch
this bunny?


1136
0:42:33,78 --> 0:42:52,8



1137
0:42:52,8 --> 0:42:53,79
Is that the--


1138
0:42:53,79 --> 0:42:57,7
is that the final--?


1139
0:42:57,7 --> 0:42:58,98
I got to admit, that was
a little bit rough.


1140
0:42:58,98 --> 0:42:59,36
HEIMO KORTH: What's up?


1141
0:42:59,36 --> 0:43:0,28
What was?


1142
0:43:0,28 --> 0:43:1,89
THOMAS MORTON: You know, it's
kind of like, buying it at the


1143
0:43:1,89 --> 0:43:5,4
supermarket, was the first time
that we just-- we found


1144
0:43:5,4 --> 0:43:7,64
it and it was, the deed
had already been done.


1145
0:43:7,64 --> 0:43:8,8
HEIMO KORTH: And this
time I had to do it?


1146
0:43:8,8 --> 0:43:10,65
THOMAS MORTON: And this time,
you had to do it, yeah.


1147
0:43:10,65 --> 0:43:11,175
So you have to--


1148
0:43:11,175 --> 0:43:12,71
I'd have to get used to that.


1149
0:43:12,71 --> 0:43:13,74
HEIMO KORTH: Well, I
grew up like that.


1150
0:43:13,74 --> 0:43:14,86
THOMAS MORTON: Does it ever--


1151
0:43:14,86 --> 0:43:15,89
does it ever affect you?


1152
0:43:15,89 --> 0:43:16,56
HEIMO KORTH: Bother me?


1153
0:43:16,56 --> 0:43:18,11
THOMAS MORTON: Yeah.


1154
0:43:18,11 --> 0:43:20,636
You ever feel bad for--


1155
0:43:20,636 --> 0:43:21,82
you ever feel bad
for the bunny?


1156
0:43:21,82 --> 0:43:22,95
HEIMO KORTH: Well,
it didn't suffer.


1157
0:43:22,95 --> 0:43:24,3
I mean--


1158
0:43:24,3 --> 0:43:25,81
THOMAS MORTON: No more than
it would in the wild.


1159
0:43:25,81 --> 0:43:26,642
HEIMO KORTH: Oh, god, no.


1160
0:43:26,642 --> 0:43:29,12
THOMAS MORTON: I mean, I
order rabbit on menus.


1161
0:43:29,12 --> 0:43:31,3
Just because I don't see it
happening doesn't mean it's


1162
0:43:31,3 --> 0:43:31,83
not happening.


1163
0:43:31,83 --> 0:43:33,92
And it's probably happening a
lot worse than what you did.


1164
0:43:33,92 --> 0:43:35,27
HEIMO KORTH: You're
darn right, it is.


1165
0:43:35,27 --> 0:43:36,8
Hey, I'll show you once.


1166
0:43:36,8 --> 0:43:38,67
And then the next
one, you do, OK?


1167
0:43:38,67 --> 0:43:39,55
THOMAS MORTON: I
do myself, OK.


1168
0:43:39,55 --> 0:43:40,4
HEIMO KORTH: OK.


1169
0:43:40,4 --> 0:43:42,48
Wet your hands a little bit.


1170
0:43:42,48 --> 0:43:44,82
Right where this joint
is, there, just--


1171
0:43:44,82 --> 0:43:47,71
just in that joint area,
pull it like this


1172
0:43:47,71 --> 0:43:48,2
and the skin'll pop.


1173
0:43:48,2 --> 0:43:48,92
THOMAS MORTON: Wow.


1174
0:43:48,92 --> 0:43:50,21
No knife cuts.


1175
0:43:50,21 --> 0:43:51,15
HEIMO KORTH: No knife cuts.


1176
0:43:51,15 --> 0:43:56,172
Stick your finger right here, go
right to the butthole area,


1177
0:43:56,172 --> 0:43:58,51
and come up and around.


1178
0:43:58,51 --> 0:44:0,91
You grab the whole tail part and
everything, the poop chute


1179
0:44:0,91 --> 0:44:4,192
and all that, pull
it like this.


1180
0:44:4,192 --> 0:44:6,7
THOMAS MORTON: You know, there
wasn't a time when, like, all


1181
0:44:6,7 --> 0:44:9,38
us animals hung out together.


1182
0:44:9,38 --> 0:44:9,89
We treat them--


1183
0:44:9,89 --> 0:44:11,23
HEIMO KORTH: All animals
are not people.


1184
0:44:11,23 --> 0:44:12,3
That's a Disney world.


1185
0:44:12,3 --> 0:44:15,97
I mean, people that say, my cat,
or else my dog, that's my


1186
0:44:15,97 --> 0:44:18,76
kid, that's my child-- that's
a bunch of baloney.


1187
0:44:18,76 --> 0:44:19,59
It's not even close.


1188
0:44:19,59 --> 0:44:20,2
There.


1189
0:44:20,2 --> 0:44:21,16
OK, just cut up, now.


1190
0:44:21,16 --> 0:44:21,61
Cut up.


1191
0:44:21,61 --> 0:44:22,74
Up.


1192
0:44:22,74 --> 0:44:24,48
They can have their
dogs and pets, you


1193
0:44:24,48 --> 0:44:25,4
know what I'm saying?


1194
0:44:25,4 --> 0:44:27,28
I mean, that's not going
to come close to


1195
0:44:27,28 --> 0:44:28,985
another human being.


1196
0:44:28,985 --> 0:44:30,96
You can't rate an animal
with a human.


1197
0:44:30,96 --> 0:44:32,853
That's not right.


1198
0:44:32,853 --> 0:44:34,3
There.


1199
0:44:34,3 --> 0:44:35,86
Skinned and gutted
your first bunny.


1200
0:44:35,86 --> 0:44:37,11
THOMAS MORTON: Yeah.


1201
0:44:37,11 --> 0:44:53,81



1202
0:44:53,81 --> 0:44:56,34
HEIMO KORTH: You guys ready?


1203
0:44:56,34 --> 0:44:57,12
Ready?


1204
0:44:57,12 --> 0:45:0,19
Of we go into the wild
blue yonder.


1205
0:45:0,19 --> 0:45:0,98
THOMAS MORTON: Can you
tell me where we're


1206
0:45:0,98 --> 0:45:2,35
walking to right now?


1207
0:45:2,35 --> 0:45:5,59
HEIMO KORTH: Oh, we're going to
go up in the ridge, by our


1208
0:45:5,59 --> 0:45:7,73
daughter's cross up there.


1209
0:45:7,73 --> 0:45:9,4
The daughter we lost
out here, we put


1210
0:45:9,4 --> 0:45:11,26
flowers there every year.


1211
0:45:11,26 --> 0:45:15,49
So that's what we're going
up there for now.


1212
0:45:15,49 --> 0:45:17,42
THOMAS MORTON: Heimo and Edna's
daughters, Krin and


1213
0:45:17,42 --> 0:45:20,49
Rhonda, are grown and live
in Fairbanks now.


1214
0:45:20,49 --> 0:45:23,17
Heimo and Edna, however, had
another daughter named Coleen


1215
0:45:23,17 --> 0:45:25,206
before either of
them was born.


1216
0:45:25,206 --> 0:45:27,77
When Coleen was two, she and her
parents were crossing the


1217
0:45:27,77 --> 0:45:30,545
Coleen river in a canoe when
it tipped over and she was


1218
0:45:30,545 --> 0:45:32,25
swept away by the current.


1219
0:45:32,25 --> 0:45:35,55
EDNA KORTH: We were floating
down to the lower cabin.


1220
0:45:35,55 --> 0:45:39,736
We had that sweeper
on the bank.


1221
0:45:39,736 --> 0:45:41,89
It tip us over.


1222
0:45:41,89 --> 0:45:43,91
She drowned and floated.


1223
0:45:43,91 --> 0:45:48,13
We couldn't reach her in time.


1224
0:45:48,13 --> 0:45:50,78
The only thing we found from
her was her little boot.


1225
0:45:50,78 --> 0:45:54,42



1226
0:45:54,42 --> 0:45:56,88
We call it Goroy Mountain.


1227
0:45:56,88 --> 0:46:0,39
We named it after
our daughter.


1228
0:46:0,39 --> 0:46:4,43
We used to call her, in Eskimo,
little pigs that eat a


1229
0:46:4,43 --> 0:46:8,813
lot, we say, goroys.


1230
0:46:8,813 --> 0:46:17,85



1231
0:46:17,85 --> 0:46:20,13
THOMAS MORTON: Did you try to
have this hill renamed?


1232
0:46:20,13 --> 0:46:20,56
HEIMO KORTH: Yeah.


1233
0:46:20,56 --> 0:46:22,39
You gotta go through a
couple committees.


1234
0:46:22,39 --> 0:46:26,64
The state said that she didn't
do anything significant.


1235
0:46:26,64 --> 0:46:27,13
THOMAS MORTON: That's awful.


1236
0:46:27,13 --> 0:46:28,38
HEIMO KORTH: They said.


1237
0:46:28,38 --> 0:46:30,8



1238
0:46:30,8 --> 0:46:44,4
EDNA KORTH: She would have been
27, 28 years this year.


1239
0:46:44,4 --> 0:46:45,52
HEIMO KORTH: [ESKIMO]


1240
0:46:45,52 --> 0:46:51,28
That's the Eskimo word
for "come." [ESKIMO]


1241
0:46:51,28 --> 0:46:52,6
HEIMO KORTH: Say it, Mom.


1242
0:46:52,6 --> 0:46:53,44
EDNA KORTH: [ESKIMO]


1243
0:46:53,44 --> 0:46:56,36
THOMAS MORTON: Sounds a lot
nicer when she says it.


1244
0:46:56,36 --> 0:46:59,9
EDNA KORTH: I told you,
you make things yours.


1245
0:46:59,9 --> 0:47:1,18
HEIMO KORTH: Oh, come on.


1246
0:47:1,18 --> 0:47:3,69
Well, this is something we were
going to do whether you


1247
0:47:3,69 --> 0:47:5,19
guys were here or not.


1248
0:47:5,19 --> 0:47:8,91
We had to do it before the
snow got too deep.


1249
0:47:8,91 --> 0:47:11,438
And it's a beautiful
day for it.


1250
0:47:11,438 --> 0:47:34,42



1251
0:47:34,42 --> 0:47:35,71
HEIMO KORTH: I don't know how
to use one of these things.


1252
0:47:35,71 --> 0:47:36,706
EDNA KORTH: Just press.


1253
0:47:36,706 --> 0:47:37,956
HEIMO KORTH: Oh, there.


1254
0:47:37,956 --> 0:48:31,984



1255
0:48:31,984 --> 0:48:34,16
HEIMO KORTH: You want this?


1256
0:48:34,16 --> 0:48:34,82
Yeah.


1257
0:48:34,82 --> 0:48:35,65
You want this?


1258
0:48:35,65 --> 0:48:39,38
There, there you go.


1259
0:48:39,38 --> 0:48:42,24
She's a real picky eater in the
beginning, but once she


1260
0:48:42,24 --> 0:48:45,42
starts, she won't stop.


1261
0:48:45,42 --> 0:48:47,57
THOMAS MORTON: Does it bum you
out that there aren't a new


1262
0:48:47,57 --> 0:48:52,39
generation of Heimos and
Ednas to come out here?


1263
0:48:52,39 --> 0:48:54,82
That once you guys are gone,
there probably won't be--


1264
0:48:54,82 --> 0:48:57,72
in ANWR, there won't
be another--


1265
0:48:57,72 --> 0:48:58,49
another set of people.


1266
0:48:58,49 --> 0:48:59,79
HEIMO KORTH: Another
final frontiersman?


1267
0:48:59,79 --> 0:49:0,62
THOMAS MORTON: Yeah.


1268
0:49:0,62 --> 0:49:2,97
HEIMO KORTH: I mean, the youth
nowadays, very few are


1269
0:49:2,97 --> 0:49:4,91
interested in the outdoors.


1270
0:49:4,91 --> 0:49:10,4
And a lot of them don't know
survival skills, which is sad.


1271
0:49:10,4 --> 0:49:12,53
Because they could run into a
situation where they need that


1272
0:49:12,53 --> 0:49:14,37
to save their life, you know?


1273
0:49:14,37 --> 0:49:16,41
Because you never know what's
going to happen in life.


1274
0:49:16,41 --> 0:49:29,89



1275
0:49:29,89 --> 0:49:31,15
THOMAS MORTON: Last
day of camp.


1276
0:49:31,15 --> 0:49:33,35
We got little gifts from Edna.


1277
0:49:33,35 --> 0:49:34,51
She made us--


1278
0:49:34,51 --> 0:49:37,57
mine is a fox skin chain toggle,
which I'm pretty


1279
0:49:37,57 --> 0:49:38,6
excited about.


1280
0:49:38,6 --> 0:49:40,76
Gonna miss this old cabin.


1281
0:49:40,76 --> 0:49:42,44
All right, this is it.


1282
0:49:42,44 --> 0:49:45,6
Supposed to be snow coming in
tonight, and the seasons are


1283
0:49:45,6 --> 0:49:47,2
about to change in a
really major way.


1284
0:49:47,2 --> 0:49:49,3
It's going to get a lot
colder than it's been


1285
0:49:49,3 --> 0:49:50,75
when we've been here.


1286
0:49:50,75 --> 0:49:53,28
And hunting season's going to
give way to trapping season.


1287
0:49:53,28 --> 0:50:8,71



1288
0:50:8,71 --> 0:50:11,15
Folks like Heimo and Edna, and
the bush pilots out here,


1289
0:50:11,15 --> 0:50:15,11
they're some of the last people
from whom you can learn


1290
0:50:15,11 --> 0:50:17,11
this dying skill set.


1291
0:50:17,11 --> 0:50:18,35
They ain't supermen.


1292
0:50:18,35 --> 0:50:22,52
They're ordinary people who
learned how to do it and then


1293
0:50:22,52 --> 0:50:23,97
went out and did it.


1294
0:50:23,97 --> 0:50:29,12
I'm now capable of feasting off
rabbit that I have caught.


1295
0:50:29,12 --> 0:50:32,18
These are all, you know--


1296
0:50:32,18 --> 0:50:34,955
these are all skills
we can rediscover.


1297
0:50:34,955 --> 0:50:41,1



1298
0:50:41,1 --> 0:50:42,54
HEIMO KORTH: All right, guys.


1299
0:50:42,54 --> 0:50:42,7
THOMAS MORTON: Bye.


1300
0:50:42,7 --> 0:50:43,54
HEIMO KORTH: Take care.


1301
0:50:43,54 --> 0:50:44,195
THOMAS MORTON: Have
a good winter.


1302
0:50:44,195 --> 0:50:44,958
HEIMO KORTH: Yeah, you too.


1303
0:50:44,958 --> 0:50:45,934
THOMAS MORTON: We will.


1304
0:50:45,934 --> 0:50:47,184
HEIMO KORTH: All right, bye.


1305
0:50:47,184 --> 0:51:11,34



1306
0:51:11,34 --> 0:51:15,47
Me and Edna, we got our-- when
we go, you know, I told her if


1307
0:51:15,47 --> 0:51:17,69
I go first, where to put me.


1308
0:51:17,69 --> 0:51:19,75
I mean, if they find
me out here.


1309
0:51:19,75 --> 0:51:20,34
That's the thing.


1310
0:51:20,34 --> 0:51:21,47
If they find me.


1311
0:51:21,47 --> 0:51:25,29
And then my ashes are going
to be way up in there.


1312
0:51:25,29 --> 0:51:26,41
That's where I wanted them.


1313
0:51:26,41 --> 0:51:29,4
And then Edna said she wants
to be here, you know.


1314
0:51:29,4 --> 0:53:29,4
