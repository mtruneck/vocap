###1 VICTORIA: Hello, everybody.
###2 Thanks so much for coming to this talk
###5 by my wonderful friend James who is also a first time author.
###10 I want to tell you three quick things about James.
###13 The first is that James' book is about the importance
###17 of experience.
###18 And I want to vouch for the fact that this guy doesn't just
###21 talk the talk, he walks the walk.
###23 James and I met 14 years-- ago almost to this day--
###28 on an overnight bus going from Delhi to Rishikesh in India.
###33 For those of you who don't know Rishikesh,
###35 it's supposed to be sort of the yoga capital of the world,
###38 the Beatles went there to see the Maharishi Mahesh,
###40 Jerry's ashes are there, et cetera.
###43 And I was, of course, there to go and check myself
###45 into an ashram to continue to do the yoga that I
###48 was in love with.
###49 And James was there to learn about this thing called yoga
###52 that he'd heard about but didn't really know what it was.
###56 He said he was going to be there for three days.
###58 And after we went into this ashram,
###60 he sort of fell in love with the Ashtanga,
###63 and the macrobiotic diet, and the meditation,
###66 and the aura reading, and even the homemade colonics,
###68 and basically, decided to stay there
###70 for 30 days with me, which is where
###72 we became such great friends.
###74 So this guy is the real deal.
###76 The second thing is that when we were in India,
###79 James and I were absolutely love struck.
###83 Not with each other.
###84 We actually both had partners-- him in London
###87 and me in the States, and we're no longer with these people--
###90 but we were so bored in the ashram at night--
###92 absolutely nothing goes on in an ashram at night--
###95 that we would write these incredible love
###97 letters to our significant others,
###98 and we would read them to each other.
###100 That's how bored we were.
###101 And I can just tell you that he is the most beautiful writer.
###104 So I'm so happy that 14 years later, he has written a book.
###108 And the third thing to tell you--
###111 just because it will endear him to you--
###113 is that James is about to become a father for the second time.
###116 He didn't know if he would be able to make it out here
###118 in time before his wife gives birth.
###119 So I'm very happy that he's here.
###121 Welcome, James.
###122 
###128 JAMES WALLMAN: Thank you, Victoria.
###130 That's pretty funny because I haven't
###132 heard that story for some time.
###134 Especially, the bit about writing the love letters
###136 and reading them to each other.
###138 Because I've actually found some I never got around to sending.
###141 And they are-- you know those really embarrassing letters
###143 that you never sent for good reason?
###146 So I'm touched that you say I was a good writer,
###148 but I think I wasn't back then.
###150 But anyway, I appreciate that very much.
###152 It's great to be back in Mountain View.
###154 And I say back because I lived in Palo Alto in 1997.
###159 And I have a strong connection to Mountain View--
###161 a strong experiential connection to Mountain View,
###163 actually-- because when I was here,
###166 I learned how to scuba dive with the Bayview Divers.
###171 Anyone learn to scuba dive in Mountain View?
###174 I have the card.
###175 It's the card I've been using on this trip to the States
###177 as my ID.
###179 So every time I was in New York before,
###180 and I was going to buildings like the Hearst Building,
###182 the Conde Nast Building, the Time & Life Building,
###184 and they want to see ID.
###185 And I gave them the ID of this scuba diving card
###189 I have from when I was in my early 20s--
###192 I mean I look completely different, obviously-- Anyway,
###195 and that was-- I checked this out-- it
###197 was before Google started.
###198 It was a year before Google started,
###200 so I was here first, all right.
###201 
###204 Thank you for coming, first of all.
###205 I really appreciate it.
###208 For those of you that don't have a copy,
###209 the book is called "Stuffication."
###211 And what I'd like to do is give you
###213 an introduction to that, where it came from for me.
###216 And the best place, I think, to begin a story of "Stuffication"
###222 in a talk like this, is a place where
###225 I think a lot of great stories begin.
###228 In a time of war with the young couple in love.
###232 So about 70 years ago-- on January 27, 1940--
###238 war was raging in some parts of Europe.
###241 But in London, it was still quite.
###243 It was a quiet night in London.
###244 There was snow falling gently.
###247 And just out of a busy, bustling, noisy dance
###252 hall, a man by the name of Jack, wearing
###255 a dark suit, a white shirt, and a Dickey bow tie
###259 stepped outside with his new bride, Pam.
###263 And he turned to Pam, and he said to her, "Come on.
###267 Let's go home."
###268 And they tramped through snow to their first home.
###272 They had two rooms.
###274 They had a living room and they had a bedroom.
###276 The kitchen and the bathroom was shared
###279 with the other people who lived in the building.
###281 A few years later, they had a son, Allen.
###284 And when Allen grew too big to share the bedroom with them,
###287 they gave him the bedroom.
###289 So every night, after Allen had gone to bed,
###292 they would make up one of those camp beds.
###295 You know those camp beds?
###296 They would make up a camp bed in the living room,
###298 and they would sleep there.
###299 And every morning, before Allen left for his paper route,
###303 he would wake to the sound of sizzling
###306 and the smell of bacon, and eggs, and sausages,
###310 and something that English people used
###312 to eat called fried bread.
###314 And Jack would get up every morning, early,
###317 and make that for Allen.
###318 And he did that every day until the day Allen
###321 left for university-- for Liverpool University-- in 1962.
###327 Allen was the first person in his family
###329 ever to go to university.
###331 He made the most of it.
###332 He played for the university soccer team.
###336 Notice I said soccer.
###339 He saw bands that were hugely famous,
###342 but he saw them before they were famous.
###344 So of course, he saw the Beatles and the Rolling Stones.
###347 And if you ever meet him, he'll tell you
###348 that within five minutes of meeting him.
###352 And then he did what most of us do after university.
###355 He settled down, he got a job, he got married, he had kids,
###359 and I'm one of them.
###361 Allen is my father.
###363 Jack is my grandfather.
###366 This is my back story.
###369 Why am I telling you this?
###372 Because in the story of our everyday, workaday family,
###380 you can see the story of stuffication.
###382 In the story of our very typical family,
###384 you can see the shift in circumstances
###389 from scarcity to abundance.
###391 And you can see the change, as well,
###393 in terms of what that means for our attitudes, our aspirations,
###397 and our values.
###399 You see my grandparents, Jack and Pam, they were typical.
###404 They lived not so very far from survival mode
###408 as most people did back then.
###410 And as 99% of humans had always done since the dawn of time.
###416 And my father was typical, too.
###418 He was a typical, materialistic baby boomer.
###422 And as a typical, materialistic baby boomer--
###426 one of the key things he did was that-- he measured his life--
###429 in many ways-- in material terms.
###431 Like the homes he lived in and the cars he drove.
###434 And I remember them all.
###436 From in the '70s, kind of boxy, sky blue Triumph Toledo.
###443 Anyone know what a Triumph Toledo is?
###445 But you can picture it.
###446 British built.
###448 It was OK.
###448 And in the '80s, he moved on to much slicker,
###451 sportier, kind of curvier, more imported cars.
###455 And he ended the decade in a red Porsche 911.
###459 And he was typical, too-- I think
###462 for his time-- in that he grew up
###464 believing in the counterintuitive idea,
###468 we should gain ground in the early 20th century, which
###471 was at the very heart of materialism.
###473 And was sometimes called the American paradox.
###476 And that was the idea.
###477 That if we wanted to have more, we had to spend more.
###482 A virtuous circle of materialism that changed circumstances.
###486 Now do you remember the last time
###488 you called someone materialistic?
###492 Have you done that in the last month?
###495 I ask people this, and most people say nothing.
###497 Then, this one.
###498 Have you thought someone's materialistic
###501 in the last month?
###503 OK.
###504 And it's quite an insulting thing to think isn't it right?
###506 You're kind of putting someone down.
###508 And that makes sense today.
###510 But back then, saying someone was
###513 materialistic-- materialism-- wasn't such a bad idea.
###518 In fact, it made perfect sense because it offered
###521 my father, Alan, and the rest of the baby boomers
###524 the straightest route-- the straightest road--
###527 from the scarcity they'd been born into to the abundance
###531 that they were helping to create.
###533 The abundance and the better world
###535 they were making for themselves, for the society
###538 around them, and for their children.
###542 So I grew up the benefactor of that to a large extent.
###548 And I also grew up believing in that idea.
###552 And I grew up thinking I would be just like my dad.
###554 I would be materialistic.
###556 But then something happened.
###558 And I think lots of things have happened.
###560 And they've all added up to this situation I call stuffication
###566 So stuffication is that feeling you
###568 get when you open up the closet, and it's full of clothes,
###575 but you can't find a single thing to wear.
###577 It's that feeling you get when you root around
###580 inside a cupboard-- whatever it might be-- to find the one
###584 thing you need through a pile of stuff that you don't use.
###588 Instead of thinking of more-- the way
###590 we used to-- as a good thing, we now
###592 think more means more hassle, more to store,
###596 more to manage, more to think about.
###599 More isn't better anymore, it's worse.
###601 I think overwhelmed, suffocating from stuff,
###604 we're feeling stuffication.
###607 Why isn't materialism working anymore?
###611 Now, as with anything as-- I think--
###614 seismic of stuffication, there are loads of different answers.
###617 If you ask a different expert, you'll
###619 get a different emphasis.
###621 So a philosopher might say that it's to do with status anxiety.
###625 We've had enough of stuff because we
###626 had enough of the status anxiety that
###629 comes with materialistic consumerism.
###631 A psychologist like Oliver James might say it's affluenza.
###635 We've had enough of stuff because it's
###638 giving us affluenza.
###639 Mass consumption is leading to mass depression.
###643 And a political scientist, might say it's
###647 because of the stable society.
###649 We're just not so bothered about stuff
###651 anymore because we know that we're
###653 going to have a roof over our heads tonight,
###656 and there's going to be food on the table tomorrow.
###658 We're just not so bothered about the basic materialistic
###662 concerns anymore.
###663 We've climbed that first stage of Maslow's hierarchy of needs.
###667 An anthropologist might say-- I'm
###670 going to quote here from the Center
###672 on the Everyday Lives of people, based in Los Angeles, which
###675 has just completed the most comprehensive report ever
###678 conducted into how people are living today.
###682 And they said-- that we have more material
###688 things than any preceding society.
###690 They use the term "light-years more possessions than any
###693 preceding society in human history."
###695 That we're struggling under material saturation,
###699 there we're coping with extraordinary clutter,
###702 and that we're in the middle of a clutter crisis.
###705 And a technologist might-- I think-- smile
###708 at all of these ideas.
###709 Ya sure, status anxiety, affluenza, the stable society,
###713 clutter crisis.
###714 This is all relevant as to why we've had enough of stuff.
###717 But the real reason that we're moving on from material things
###721 is because we can.
###723 Why have a room full of Encyclopedia Britannicas when
###727 you can search for the answer you're
###729 looking for through-- as a search angle-- Google,
###732 you can use.
###734 Worth a try, that joke, right?
###737 That's why I'm a writer, not a comedian.
###739 Anyway, but thanks.
###741 But why have a car, why have a second car, when
###744 you can use Zipcar or you can use Uber?
###747 Why have a suitcase full of books
###749 when you go on holiday-- for those of you
###750 that went on holiday in the '70s and '80s--
###752 it was a real challenge about which
###754 books were you going to take with you.
###755 But why do that when you have a Kindle?
###760 I think you know what it looks like anyway right?
###762 But that-- thousands of books-- why have a room full of books?
###765 
###768 I think all of these reasons is partly
###770 responsible for stuffication.
###773 But if you think about them-- I think
###774 what's really interesting about them is none of them are blips.
###778 None of them are blips that are here
###779 one year and likely to be gone the next.
###782 I think they're all observable, observed, long-term trends.
###787 And that's why I think stuffication
###789 is going to be the defining problem of the 21st century.
###794 So how do you solve a problem like stuffication?
###799 Now my job-- the job of a trend forecaster, not comedian
###802 as we've already established-- is fascinating.
###807 It gives me really interesting insight,
###811 gives me a really unique viewpoint,
###813 and it opens me up to a lot of ridicule.
###817 As Yogi Berra said, "It's hard to make predictions,
###820 particularly about the future.
###822 And the thing is, if you're going to make a prediction,
###825 if you're going to say something's
###826 going to happen in the future, at the very least,
###828 you'd better have a decent methodology.
###831 So I don't look into a crystal ball.
###836 And I don't read tea leaves, and I've tried.
###840 Maybe in Rishikesh.
###842 And I don't breath in vapors by the Oracle at Delphi.
###847 The method I use is far less ancient,
###850 but I think it's far more robust.
###853 It's inspired by something a futurist--
###856 called William Gibson-- once said,
###858 that "The future is already here,
###860 it's just not very evenly distributed. "
###863 And it's informed by a way of reading cultural change,
###866 which has been applied more than 5,000 times since it was first
###871 codified by a sociologist called Everett Rogers,
###874 Iowa State University in 1962.
###878 Some of you will have heard of it.
###879 It's the diffusion of innovations.
###881 And it's a way of reading cultural change that works out
###884 how ideas, innovations, new ways of living,
###888 working, cooking, whatever it might be,
###890 spread from the innovators-- the few innovators
###893 to the early adopters, the early majority, late majority,
###897 and [INAUDIBLE].
###898 So my job is to spot the future here in the present.
###905 It's to identify the innovators in the innovations,
###909 the big ideas that are going to catch on and spread
###912 from these few people to the many in the mainstream.
###918 So I've looked all around the world looking for the answer,
###922 looking to understand this problem better
###925 and to find an idea-- which I think-- has the power,
###929 has the legs, has the ability to move from these few
###933 to these many.
###935 And as you can imagine, I've run up many blind alleys.
###938 I've kind of come to lots of dead ends
###940 and all kinds of things that I thought were the answer.
###944 Minimalism is a great example.
###947 But of all the things I've looked at--
###949 and the book is, to a large extent,
###950 a kind of process of me going through this one,
###953 does this work?
###954 This one, does it work?-- I've come across one idea, which
###958 I think is going to catch on and become dominant.
###961 I call it experientialism.
###963 And the people who live this way, experientialists.
###968 So the experientialists, instead of looking for status,
###972 identity, happiness, and meaning in material things--
###977 like materialists did-- experientialists
###979 are finding status, identity, happiness,
###983 and meaning, and experiences instead.
###987 Experientialism-- and I've said it a lot of times--
###992 I think can solve a problem like stuffication.
###997 More importantly, experientialism, I believe,
###999 will solve stuffication.
###1002 And I say that because firstly, it's better.
###1006 It's just better the materialism.
###1008 Giving us status, giving us identity,
###1011 giving us meaning in our lives, and making us happy.
###1015 But more important than that-- more important
###1017 than being better-- I've seen the signs.
###1020 I've seen the evidence.
###1021 Even if it's still unevenly distributed,
###1026 that we are moving away from materialism,
###1029 and the experientialism is making the leap
###1032 from the innovative few to the many in the mainstream.
###1037 So first up, there's the evidence
###1039 that shows that our attitudes are changing.
###1041 There's a guy called Ron Inglehart-- he's
###1043 a political scientist at the University of Michigan--
###1046 and based on a hunch that Ron had back in 1969,
###1052 he started studying our attitudes.
###1053 And in 1970, he found that 80% of people
###1057 were materialistic in Western countries.
###1060 Now-- in today's world-- it's 50%.
###1064 So you can see very clear, there is long-term decline
###1067 in how materialistic we are.
###1071 And I think where it's really interesting is that, as well
###1073 as our attitudes changing, there is now evidence
###1076 that our behavior is changing, as well.
###1079 There's a guy called Chris Goodall-- he's a Cambridge
###1081 grad, he was a McKinsey consultant,
###1084 he taught economics at Harvard for a time--
###1087 he has analyzed the material flows-- the flow of materials--
###1092 through Western economies, so looking
###1095 at the States and the UK, for example.
###1097 And he's discovered that we are consuming less stuff.
###1101 Less paper, concrete, cars, steel, fertilizers,
###1105 electricity.
###1107 He's happy having seen all this evidence
###1111 to conclude that we've reached the point of peak stuff,
###1115 and that we're now passing that point.
###1117 Now besides those there's technology.
###1120 And I mean, technology in terms of wearable tech.
###1124 For example, the quantified self movement, life logging,
###1128 and social media.
###1129 All of these things make our lives
###1132 much more connected, much more trackable, and much more
###1136 sharable.
###1137 I imagine you're aware of this, right?
###1141 What's really interesting for me about all these technologies--
###1146 in particular, I think the social aspect of it,
###1148 social media-- is they're fundamentally
###1150 changing how we express our identities and we get status.
###1155 So go back to the 20th century.
###1157 The best way to get status and express your identity
###1159 in the 20th century, was through the stuff
###1162 you owned-- handbag, car, shoes, whatever
###1165 it might be-- not from what you did.
###1167 Because back then, who knew that you'd
###1171 been to Utah or Tahoe skiing for the weekend?
###1177 Who knew you'd been to Marrakech on your vacation?
###1181 Who knew you'd been to a really great talk from a trend
###1184 forecaster at lunch time?
###1187 Thank you for staying with me there.
###1188 I appreciate that.
###1191 My wife says that was a funny joke, but they you go.
###1194 But the thing is, in today's world,
###1196 with all your followers on Twitter, Instagram, Google+,
###1199 and Facebook-- your friends, fans, followers-- they do.
###1205 So now if you take a picture from the chair
###1208 lift in Squaw Valley or Park City,
###1211 or if you take a picture of the sun setting behind the Atlas
###1214 mountains from the rooftop of your riad in Marrakech,
###1218 or you even tweet a quote from something
###1220 you heard a talk at lunch time.
###1223 And this matters.
###1224 This matters because it matters for how
###1226 we express our identities and we get our status.
###1228 And that matters for people because status and identity
###1232 matters, right?
###1233 And social media and this technology
###1235 matters for the rise of experientialism
###1238 because this isn't the innovative few anymore.
###1242 There are hundreds of millions of people using Instagram,
###1246 Twitter, and Google+.
###1247 There's 1.2 billion people on Facebook--
###1250 that's as many people as are in the Catholic Church-- who
###1254 are expressing their identities and getting their status,
###1259 not from what they have, but from what they do.
###1263 And this matters-- I believe-- for you, for me,
###1266 and for all of us.
###1267 The question is, I guess, how?
###1271 About 12 years ago-- on January 27, 2002--
###1276 my father brought my grandparents--
###1278 Jack and Pam-- over for lunch to my new apartment.
###1283 It was my first home.
###1284 It was in Brixton, in south London
###1286 and it had three bedrooms.
###1289 I had a living room, I had a separate dining room,
###1291 a separate kitchen, had this great, big, west facing garden.
###1295 It was awesome for parties.
###1297 It was a great first home.
###1299 And they come over for lunch.
###1300 And I had a job in advertising at the time.
###1303 I think I was a bit gung-ho, talking
###1304 quite big about how successful I was and was going to be.
###1308 And just before they left, my grandfather
###1311 handed me an envelope.
###1313 And just after they left, I opened it, as you can imagine.
###1318 And it had a note in it.
###1319 And it had on it 27/1/2002-- he wrote the date the British way
###1324 with the day and then the month-- "On this day in 1940,
###1331 Nana and I tramped through snow to our first home.
###1334 Memories live longer than dreams.
###1337 Good luck."
###1340 A little bit later-- probably 20 to 25 minutes later-- my father
###1344 was just driving back starting to cross the river Thames--
###1348 it was a black 5 Series BMW, if you're keep up
###1350 with the cars of my father-- and my grandfather choked.
###1356 And he kind of collapsed in his seat.
###1358 My father obviously stopped.
###1359 And then he drove as fast as he could.
###1363 He jumped lights.
###1364 He actually got pulled over and got a police escort.
###1367 He did everything he could to get my grandfather
###1369 to a hospital as quickly as possible.
###1371 
###1376 He did what he could, but my grandfather died that day.
###1379 And obviously, I thought about the note
###1383 that he gave me quite a lot since then.
###1388 First of all, did he know that he
###1392 was going to die that day when he gave me that note?
###1395 And what did he mean by memories live longer than dreams?
###1401 Did he mean that the past is not as good as the future?
###1407 Or did he mean-- as I've come to believe-- that the material
###1412 dreams are all well and good, but life
###1415 is made of up memories, which come from experiences?
###1420 Now whatever he meant, it was quite a passing shot.
###1425 In those final moments, to address
###1430 the most important question a person can ask.
###1432 The question that Aristotle asked in the Nicomachean
###1435 Ethics, almost 2 and 1/2 thousand years ago.
###1437 The question every one of us should ask-- as individuals,
###1442 as parents, as influential people
###1445 who market stuff and change the world, being citizens or where
###1449 we work, whatever it might be.
###1451 And the question is-- I think you know the question, right?
###1456 How should we live in order to be happy?
###1460 And in the 20th century, I think the answer
###1463 to that, in many ways, was clear.
###1466 You should be materialistic because that
###1469 was creating abundance for everybody.
###1472 And I think in the 21st century, when our problem isn't
###1476 scarcity, our problem is abundance-- I think so much
###1480 abundance that there's time of stuffication-- I think
###1483 that quite the answer has fundamentally changed.
###1485 
###1488 So the story of stuffication ends with you.
###1493 
###1496 What are you going to do about the most pressing problem
###1500 of our time?
###1503 There are 3 things you can do to try out experientialism.
###1509 Three steps.
###1509 First step, destufficate.
###1512 Step two, don't restufficate.
###1515 Once you've gone through the bother of getting
###1517 rid of all that stuff you don't wear, you don't need,
###1520 you don't use.
###1521 And it's so easy to go out when you've
###1523 created space in your closet on your shelf,
###1525 because we've been trained to be consumers, to do that.
###1528 But it's really important not to go out and buy
###1531 more stuff you don't need, you don't use, you don't wear.
###1535 But for me, step 3 is the best bet.
###1538 Because 1 and 2 are just hygiene factors.
###1539 They're just starting points.
###1541 Step 3 is a game.
###1543 And it's a game I like to think of as the Brewster's Millions
###1546 game.
###1548 Some of you probably won't have read the 1902 novel
###1551 or seen the 1985 movie.
###1554 Anyone got no idea what Brewsters Millions is?
###1557 All right.
###1557 Oh, a few of you.
###1558 OK.
###1559 It only got 6.4 out of 10 on IMDB, which is a crying shame
###1565 and it's wrong.
###1565 It's a great movie.
###1566 Anyway.
###1567 So Brewster's Millions, the movie,
###1569 is about this guy who has to spend $30 million in a month
###1573 and have nothing physical, tangible to show for it.
###1579 Now to play the game properly, you
###1581 don't have to spend $30 million in a month, unless you have it,
###1586 that's obviously your choice.
###1589 But what you do have to do-- to play the game properly
###1592 and to really experience the benefits-- is
###1594 to spend the same amount of money
###1596 that you'd spend in a normal month,
###1599 but have nothing physical, tangible
###1602 to show for it at the end.
###1604 And that's all you have to do to join the experientialists.
###1608 
###1610 And if you do that-- I promise you-- you'll have more stories,
###1615 you'll have more status, you'll be happier,
###1619 life will feel like it has a lot more meaning.
###1623 But more than that, I think you'll be one of the pioneers.
###1626 I think you'll be one of the pioneers leading
###1628 the rest of society out of the storm of stuffication
###1632 on the straightest, most positive, most aspirational,
###1636 most fun route to a better world.
###1639 I think you'll be one of the pioneers leading
###1642 the rest of America, the rest of the West,
###1644 the rest of the world from the old age of materialism
###1649 to this new era of experientialism.
###1653 And more than that even, I think you'll
###1655 understand what my grandfather, Jack, meant
###1658 that memories live longer than dreams.
###1660 
###1663 Thank you.
###1664 
###1673 Questions, if anyone has any.
###1674 AUDIENCE: So if we take this to the end, and everybody becomes
###1679 destuffified, and we are so good at it
###1683 that everybody around the world becomes destuffified--
###1688 JAMES WALLMAN: Destufficated, but I like your version.
###1690 AUDIENCE: That's right.
###1692 So then what happens to Google?
###1694 JAMES WALLMAN: Great question, I think.
###1695 OK.
###1696 So I'm just going to repeat that back to you.
###1698 If everyone becomes destuffified,
###1704 what happens to Google?
###1705 Can you be a little more specific?
###1706 I think I know what you're saying.
###1708 
###1709 If you take it to its purest end,
###1713 like we need to go to the grocery store.
###1714 We need stuff, certain stuff.
###1717 
###1720 I guess what I'm confused about in implementing
###1722 this in my own life is, what do you spend money
###1726 on-- it's kind of a riddle-- what do you spend money
###1729 on and have nothing to show for it?
###1732 You know what I mean?
###1733 JAMES WALLMAN: OK.
###1733 That's a great question.
###1734 So how do you spend money and not
###1737 end up with something at the end?
###1740 When did you last go holiday?
###1743 AUDIENCE: Friday.
###1744 JAMES WALLMAN: Oh, great.
###1745 Friday.
###1747 Please give the man a mic.
###1749 Where did you go?
###1750 AUDIENCE: I went and bought a new car.
###1752 
###1755 JAMES WALLMAN: OK.
###1756 Can I-- just to get a little bit of clarity here,
###1759 that's not playing the game.
###1762 A holiday is not buying a car.
###1765 You've actually picked up on two very brilliant examples
###1768 of different purchases.
###1769 I have a car and I take holidays.
###1771 I would conceive one of those-- don't get me wrong,
###1774 it gives me experiences-- but one is quite a material
###1776 purchase.
###1777 The thing about not having anything
###1779 at the end of it, a great example is a holiday.
###1781 That's why I wanted to follow it down that route.
###1783 I didn't know you were going to play nasty.
###1787 So let's say you go skiing for a week.
###1792 What do you have, physically, at the end of it?
###1794 You might have some pictures on your telephone,
###1796 but, really what you've had, is a great time.
###1798 Or let's say you go on a stag party, which
###1800 is a-- what do you call it over here?
###1803 Bachelor Party.
###1804 You don't take any pictures, right?
###1807 But you have an amazing time.
###1810 It gives you [INAUDIBLE] and identity are quite closely
###1813 connected, gives you real identity,
###1816 it gives you, hopefully, some happiness.
###1817 You've had a good time, if you can remember any of it.
###1820 And it gives life a sense of meaning.
###1823 But you don't come back from it with a whole bunch of stuff,
###1826 do you?
###1827 Hopefully, you've lost stuff.
###1828 Anyway, so just to be really clear.
###1830 So in terms of what I mean by experiences,
###1833 is that which is something where you're doing something
###1837 rather than having something.
###1839 That's the kind of classic distinction.
###1841 There's two psychologists-- called [INAUDIBLE]
###1845 and Tom Gilovich-- and they had a paper they published in 2003
###1850 called, "To Do or To Have?
###1851 That Is the Question."
###1853 And it was-- it is-- considered to be
###1855 the kind of classic moment in research.
###1859 To find, for the first time, whether material goods
###1862 or experiential goods gave people more happiness.
###1864 And they proved, for the first time,
###1865 that experiential goods gave people more happiness.
###1868 But to begin that piece of research,
###1870 they started by saying, what's a material good?
###1873 What's an experiential good?
###1874 Because for some people, a TV is experiential, and some people,
###1878 it's material.
###1880 Just to be really clear, this is not anti-consumerist,
###1882 it's not anti-capitalists, it's not even anti stuff.
###1886 It's totally pro consumers, pro capitalist,
###1890 and it's not anti stuff.
###1891 It's having stuff.
###1893 We bought a bread maker a couple of weeks ago.
###1895 Now that has got the potential to be a waste of money.
###1898 But my wife insists that we will use it--
###1900 and we fully intend to-- in which case,
###1902 it's got use, right?
###1904 So it's not anti having stuff, it's
###1905 anti having too much stuff.
###1909 Does that answer your question?
###1910 AUDIENCE: That does.
###1911 Yeah.
###1911 I now know how to implement your three principles.
###1913 JAMES WALLMAN: Great.
###1914 Thank you.
###1914 Good.
###1914 AUDIENCE: Hi.
###1915 I think you make some very interesting points.
###1917 I mean, I can relate to what you say in terms of my parents
###1920 lived a simpler life than me.
###1923 My grandparents lived a simpler life.
###1925 And they were happier.
###1926 They were more social.
###1928 They interacted with more people.
###1929 They had fewer things.
###1931 Another trend I've seen in my generation
###1936 is not just materialism, but it's also boredom.
###1938 People are just bored.
###1939 If we have so many things to do.
###1941 We have more to do, we are always bored.
###1943 I've never heard that word from my previous generations.
###1946 So do you see a correlation between the two?
###1950 JAMES WALLMAN: That's a great question
###1952 that no one has asked me in any presentation I've given.
###1956 So you-- can I just say back to you-- saying there are so
###1959 many things to do, we're bored.
###1960 AUDIENCE: People get bored with their job.
###1963 They have more opportunity, but every type of person
###1966 you talk to, their like, I'm so bored with my job.
###1968 Whereas, if I look at my uncle-- who worked at the same place
###1971 for 30 years-- he never used the term bored.
###1974 They were just happy doing what they did.
###1977 JAMES WALLMAN: I'd really like to give a good answer generally
###1981 but I don't know if I have an answer
###1982 because I think having loads of possibilities-- I mean, boredom
###1987 is your own responsibility, right?
###1988 It comes to the weekend and you've got a choice
###1990 of-- especially where you guys live, right?--
###1993 there's so many outdoor activities you can do.
###1996 Or you can go to San Francisco.
###1999 I mean, the world's, kind of, here.
###2000 There's so many things we can do now.
###2002 I think being bored is terrible.
###2004 And if you're bored of your job, you should do a different job.
###2007 I, personally, am infused by my job.
###2009 And it's been my experience of the people
###2011 that I-- I was in New York for a few days,
###2014 I've now been here in California for a few days,
###2016 and everyone-- I've talked to seems to be really fired up.
###2021 We went to a great Super Bowl party
###2023 and no one seemed bored at all.
###2027 I don't know, is this just a general malaise?
###2031 OK.
###2031 Because I would have thought, if you've got more things to do,
###2033 it's just a question of having-- there
###2035 are challenges with attention.
###2037 Absolutely no doubt about it.
###2038 There are challenges with sticking with something
###2040 long enough to enjoy it.
###2043 But I don't know if I can answer that better than that.
###2045 AUDIENCE: It's probably related to lack of attention span.
###2048 Over time, we've lost attention span
###2050 with so many things around us.
###2053 Kind of like you said, we open our closet,
###2056 but we don't like anything.
###2058 And it's like, what is it that we're looking for?
###2060 We have lost that, to some extent.
###2063 JAMES WALLMAN: Well you can become
###2064 a kind of zombie consumer.
###2065 You just buy more stuff because you
###2067 think it's going to solve problems.
###2069 You're going to turn to retail therapy.
###2071 But that's the truth about retail therapy,
###2073 in terms of buying stuff, it won't make you any happier.
###2075 But if you buy an experiential good,
###2077 like going on a rock climbing course,
###2080 you'll be so scared you won't be able to be bored.
###2084 So if you're bored, go rock climbing, or skiing,
###2086 or surfing.
###2087 That's frightening, too.
###2089 AUDIENCE: What's different with social media
###2092 now replacing some of the materialistic aspects of that
###2099 is different from coming back with a bunch of slides
###2103 or coming back with some videos that I took on my camcorder?
###2107 JAMES WALLMAN: Great question.
###2108 Thank you.
###2108 I think this comes to the heart why social media is important.
###2112 If you-- I'm going to guess you're in your 20s, right?
###2116 AUDIENCE: Just left them.
###2117 JAMES WALLMAN: OK.
###2119 So if you went on holiday in the '90s, or your friends--
###2123 you ever remember going to a friend's house in the '90s,
###2126 and they-- would pull out their holiday snaps.
###2128 And there was that that awful moment where you think,
###2130 Oh, God.
###2131 And they'd show you a picture Jean at the Acropolis
###2134 and then Jean eats souvlaki and then Jean doing something else.
###2138 How painfully dull was that, right?
###2141 And it took them-- if you think about it--
###2143 how long did it take them to share
###2145 their holiday with people?
###2147 Because they would have had to have, not just you around,
###2150 all their other friends.
###2151 So let's say it's the '90s, and you
###2154 go on a really incredible holiday.
###2156 Let's say you go to Greece, and you're really excited about it,
###2157 and you go see the ruins, et cetera.
###2159 And you want to tell 100 of your best friends
###2161 about your holiday.
###2163 And let's say-- it's hard to do it at a party--
###2166 so you need to see them at dinner or at personal drinks,
###2168 right?
###2169 So let's say you can manage 6 people at a time.
###2172 Stay with me here for the math.
###2173 So you've got to have 10, 15 different arrangements
###2177 to see people.
###2179 That takes a long time-- takes like a couple of months--
###2182 to share with people your experiences.
###2185 Whereas today, you could post it on Facebook,
###2188 and you've got your 500, 600 friends that
###2190 are right there that can see it.
###2192 So what social media has done has catalyzed that opportunity
###2196 to share what you're doing.
###2198 So if you'd just run a Tough Mudder
###2199 course-- I think this is one of the reasons why Tough Mudder is
###2202 increasing so quickly-- you can instantly
###2206 share that with people.
###2207 And that has a real impact on how you see yourself.
###2211 It has a real impact on how you present yourselves to others.
###2216 So that's what social media has done.
###2219 I constantly hear about Facebook,
###2221 it'll be something else next.
###2223 It doesn't matter which platform it is that people are using.
###2226 We now are used to the idea of social media.
###2229 It will stay with us.
###2231 Now that means there's been a fundamental shift
###2233 from having things to doing things
###2235 in terms of expressing our identities.
###2237 AUDIENCE: So I'm a Millennial, a group about whom our consumer
###2242 behavior as much has been speculated.
###2243 We are the group least likely to buy a car now, least
###2246 likely to buy a house.
###2247 And I always get a little weary when
###2250 I hear about how people are like,
###2251 oh, your generation just values Instagram and social media
###2255 and you like experiences more than things because you just
###2258 like sharing your every thought on Facebook.
###2261 Mostly, it's actually because I think
###2263 were less likely to buy cars because-- like me instead--
###2266 you're spending the equivalent of a brand new BMW S
###2269 series on your education.
###2271 And so it's not so much that I like Instagraming photos
###2274 from my bike ride more, as I feel like I have actually less
###2278 money to spend on stuff.
###2280 And so I'm wondering what the recession you feel
###2284 might play into this movement away from stuff, how you think
###2287 it's maybe going to be different for people for my generation,
###2289 for whom, things are just going to become
###2292 less part of the picture because of the rising
###2294 cost of other things, like healthcare, like education.
###2297 And whether or not you think then
###2299 that some of your advice on how you would implement those three
###2302 steps would be different.
###2305 JAMES WALLMAN: Good questions.
###2307 I think you've asked me quite a lot of things there.
###2308 I'm going to try to say back to you.
###2309 No, it's fine.
###2310 It's really interesting. , Especially since you are
###2312 a Millennial, it's very easy for me stand here and say,
###2314 Millennial's are doing this, but you are a Millennial.
###2317 So you're asking me, how should a Millennial
###2321 implement those three steps?
###2324 That was your final part, but before that you were saying,
###2329 what do I think about education?
###2331 Where does education fit into this?
###2333 And the economy.
###2334 Education, economy, and how does that
###2336 affect Millennials and this shift from materialism
###2338 to experientialism.
###2339 AUDIENCE: Yeah, I'm wondering how you see the recession
###2343 and rising costs of education is factoring into people's choice
###2345 not to buy things.
###2347 JAMES WALLMAN: All right.
###2348 So the economy is a really complicated one--
###2352 to be frank with you-- because it's certainly
###2355 something I would never try and forecast.
###2357 Because there's so much.
###2358 
###2361 In terms of how it affects people--
###2363 I think is really interesting because-- there's
###2365 a particular time of your life and if there is a recession--
###2368 or there's a lack of money in your family around that time--
###2372 you become much more materialistic
###2374 than other people.
###2375 So this kind of broad brush approach,
###2376 that the boomers were this, and the Millennials are this,
###2379 and Gen X are like this, it's quite broad brush
###2383 over-- generalizations.
###2384 And there will be different people within that.
###2385 My brother and I are two years apart,
###2387 and he is far more materialistic than me.
###2389 Because not long after my father having that Porsche,
###2392 his company disappeared.
###2393 And therefore, all the money did as well.
###2395 Therefore, my brother went through a crucial period
###2397 where we had no money.
###2399 And therefore, he's much more materialistic than I am.
###2401 So the economy will affect this is an interesting way.
###2404 And some people will feel less stable
###2406 and therefore, become more materialistic.
###2409 But we've also had recessions before.
###2411 That kind of comes and goes.
###2413 I don't know if you Nate Silver's
###2414 "The Signal and the Noise" but if you consider how forecasting
###2417 works, and the way that trends work,
###2419 you may consider the idea that 80% of people that
###2423 were materialistic, and now it's 50%.
###2425 Within that time, it will go down a bit.
###2429 So I think there's still a long term trend.
###2431 In terms of education, I would say
###2432 education is a great example of an experiential good.
###2436 It's not tangible.
###2438 I don't know what your educational situation is,
###2441 but for those of us that have a degree of the first level,
###2445 the next level, or a doctorate, how many of us have the--
###2450 do you get certificates over here?
###2452 Do you keep them?
###2453 I have no idea where my certificates are.
###2457 I don't think my mom has them even.
###2460 It's very much an experiential good.
###2462 It's not a material good.
###2463 It's not a kind of solid thing.
###2466 And as a Millennial, in terms of those three ideas,
###2470 I don't actually think it makes a difference what age
###2473 or who you are.
###2475 The simple aspect of it is, if you want to be happier--
###2479 And the research is fascinating.
###2480 If you look at the research that experiential
###2482 versus material goods.
###2483 There's one great example.
###2485 People are happier, if they talk about experiences.
###2489 And we enjoy listening to people that
###2491 talk about experiences more.
###2493 So on that basis, if you've got a choice,
###2496 you're feeling bored on a Saturday morning,
###2498 go spend your money and time doing an experience.
###2500 You'll be happier because you'll be doing it.
###2502 You'll be happier because when you talk to people about it,
###2505 you'll be happier.
###2506 And you'll have more friends because people
###2508 will want to listen to you more.
###2509 So an experiential good is so much more positive.
###2511 The other aspects about a experiential good-- as opposed
###2515 a material good-- have you ever bought
###2516 a pair of shoes that squeak when you walk in them?
###2519 Or those trousers that seem to swish?
###2521 Or a coat.
###2522 What do you do with those shoes, or those things?
###2525 You wear them but they annoy you.
###2526 You never want to wear them.
###2528 Eventually, you throw them away or do you just squeak?
###2531 Maybe you do.
###2532 The thing about a material good, if you buy a material good,
###2534 and it's not very good, there's nothing you can do about it.
###2537 You bought a bad good.
###2538 That's it.
###2539 If you have an experience that goes wrong.
###2542 The bus trip across-- I was going
###2544 to say a bus trip across India [INAUDIBLE],
###2546 but since that was a fun bus trip.
###2547 But the bus trip across India-- or Peru, or Columbia,
###2551 or Thailand where it all goes wrong.
###2554 Have you all been on one of those?
###2556 The person next to you was sick, or some other unpleasant thing
###2559 was happening, the windows wouldn't shut
###2561 or they wouldn't open, it was too hot, too
###2563 cold, you were sick.
###2565 It all went wrong.
###2565 It was supposed to take 2 hours, it took 3 days.
###2568 Have you all been one of those trips?
###2570 And how bad was it at the time?
###2573 And how amazing is it now?
###2575 And that's the funny thing about experiences.
###2578 If you buy an experience, and it's really bad,
###2581 it's actually brilliant.
###2583 So my advice to you would be shift from material things
###2586 to experiences.
###2588 It has a lot of other knock on effects as well.
###2590 The environment, for example.
###2593 But yeah, those are reasons.
###2594 AUDIENCE: I'm wondering how you not
###2596 get stufficated by the stuff of experience.
###2598 So for example, if you go skiing, you have the skis.
###2600 You might have the scuba gear.
###2602 You have the bread maker.
###2603 You have all that stuff, right?
###2605 Maybe you go to Thailand, and you
###2606 buy that beautiful painting, but you went to Peru,
###2608 and you bought this other thing.
###2609 All of a sudden, your house is full of stuff,
###2611 but it's all related to experience.
###2613 So how do you not get stufficated?
###2614 JAMES WALLMAN: That is a great question.
###2616 It's funny, there's a bit in the book where
###2618 I, kind of, really take that on.
###2620 There's a guy in the book called Ben Howe.
###2623 He's an Australian.
###2624 If you go to his house in Adelaide in South Australia,
###2628 he's got a really regular house.
###2629 If anything, it's not messy, but it's not completed.
###2633 You know, you walk into your friend's house
###2635 and sometimes think, how long have you lived here?
###2637 And you think they've been a month,
###2638 but they've been there years.
###2639 It's kinda that.
###2642 But you go to the garage, and you put up the, kind of,
###2645 rickety door, it's full of stuff.
###2648 He's got his motorbike in there, he's got his kite surfing kit,
###2650 he's got his wind surfing kit, he's got his rock climbing kit,
###2653 he's got his skiing kit.
###2654 I'm not anti stuff.
###2656 The message of stuffication is not anti stuff,
###2658 it's anti too much stuff.
###2660 It's anti focus on stuff.
###2662 I wish I mentioned the bread maker because that really
###2664 is stuff.
###2665 But anyway, the smell of fresh bread, it's a lovely thing.
###2668 But if you want to ski, you have to have things to do that.
###2673 At the same time, a walk in the park
###2675 is an experience you can have and don't need a lot of stuff
###2678 apart from feet.
###2679 And if you look at statistics, if you live near a park,
###2682 you will be happier.
###2684 It's just one of those facts.
###2686 So and you mentioned going to Peru and buying the painting,
###2689 you don't have to buy that painting.
###2690 AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].
###2693 JAMES WALLMAN: Well I've been to Peru, I have no paintings.
###2696 [INAUDIBLE] No paintings from Peru.
###2699 I have a couple of paintings.
###2700 But I remember it really well-- I heard a howler monkey,
###2704 for example-- and this was certainly in an era
###2708 before I had a telephone that could record sounds--
###2710 but I can remember the sound of that surreal howler monkey
###2715 to this day.
###2717 I hadn't talked about that howler monkey
###2718 for about a decade, so thank you for bringing that back to me.
###2721 But you don't need to have stuff to have an experience.
###2724 Although, the two sometimes come together.
###2727 AUDIENCE: Could there be too many experiences?
###2729 To the point where the value of them
###2732 is lessened because you're doing so many things?
###2734 I think my life has shifted in that way.
###2736 I don't have a car, I've lived in so many different places,
###2739 so I could always purge.
###2740 And I'm always Tahoe or Europe or whatever.
###2743 But maybe you're searching for something big,
###2747 like bigger the next time.
###2748 Could it dull what's important and what makes you happy?
###2751 JAMES WALLMAN: Thank you.
###2752 It's a really good question as well.
###2754 And its really interesting talking to people that move
###2756 country a lot.
###2756 They get this so quickly because they do the country move
###2760 purge all the time.
###2762 And by definition of moving from one country to another,
###2765 they're appreciating the experience
###2767 of going to another country.
###2767 They tend to be more interested in this kind of thing.
###2769 
###2772 And I've spent a couple ski seasons in the mountains.
###2775 At the end of five months of being at a ski resort--
###2778 I have to be honest-- it sort of loses some of its fizz,
###2781 compared to right at the beginning.
###2783 And for someone who's got so many experiences,
###2789 that your signs get dulled by experiences,
###2792 that is a great problem to have.
###2794 Let's be really clear here.
###2795 Stuffication is a fantastic problem to have.
###2800 Scarcity-- not having enough-- is a horrible problem to have,
###2803 actually.
###2804 And I'm not saying this for everyone in the world.
###2807 This is for rich, Western countries.
###2809 Other countries don't have nearly the abundance
###2812 that we have per capita, but as a whole country.
###2816 So stuffication is a great problem to have.
###2818 If you get to the point where you've done wind walking,
###2823 you've flown in helicopters, you've been skiing in Kashmir,
###2828 you've spent time with monkeys, whatever it might be, right?
###2830 If you've got to the point where you're stufficated
###2832 with experience, are you saying you're at that point now?
###2836 Because I'd say that is an amazing problem to have.
###2839 
###2846 The thing is as well here, is that there's
###2848 an element of the material versus the experiential choice,
###2851 being a first level heuristic-- a kind
###2854 of simple way of making the right choice-- because one
###2857 of the key things about this actually is, is it extrinsic
###2861 or is it intrinsic?
###2862 In terms of how you make the decision.
###2864 So if you buy material good for yourself--
###2869 So I'm not trying to show off to you about my break maker.
###2871 I really mean that-- I'm buying the bread maker because we
###2874 discussed it and we think we will
###2876 enjoy having that experience.
###2878 And fresh bread is really expensive in London,
###2880 by the way.
###2881 I don't want to fixate on this bread maker.
###2883 But we the decision for us.
###2885 We're not doing as an extrinsic thing to say, hey, look at us,
###2888 we bought a bread maker.
###2889 And it can be the with same with experiences.
###2891 You know those people who will go
###2893 to the place to go on holiday.
###2895 They'll read a magazine and go that's the place I have
###2897 to go on holiday because then I can
###2899 tell people I've been there.
###2900 You know these people?
###2901 You all have friends like that, or acquaintances?
###2904 You don't get as much pleasure if you
###2906 buy that experiential good for an extrinsic reason,
###2910 than if you buy it for an intrinsic reason.
###2913 But-- and this is why I like the distinction between material
###2917 and experiential decisions-- even if you
###2919 buy that experiential good to show off to other people--
###2924 to tell people who you are other than doing it for yourself--
###2927 you'll still be doing that thing.
###2929 Let's say you decided that you have
###2932 to ski in Squaw Valley-- for the sake of argument--
###2934 now there's snow there, you've decided
###2935 that you have to do that so you can tell your friends
###2937 you've done it.
###2938 You'll still be skiing in Squaw Valley.
###2941 Do you see what I mean?
###2942 So that's why I think that distinction works.
###2944 But if you get to that point the stufficate with experiences,
###2947 let's definitely talk.
###2948 AUDIENCE: Isn't the risk that we are replacing
###2952 one problem with just another?
###2954 With stuffing our lives with experiences and actually,
###2960 our time is much more limited than this pace we have.
###2964 So is it a better way to live your life actually,
###2970 or should we actually look for even another answer.
###2974 Make time to think and not just to get our experiences
###2979 going for holidays, new restaurants, and so on.
###2983 JAMES WALLMAN: It's a really good question.
###2985 Thank you.
###2987 Often when I'm explaining this-- and I
###2989 give a talk on this-- I tend to talk about things that you do,
###2995 actively do.
###2996 Because probably, it's easier to visualize,
###2998 and it makes it a bit more interesting to listen to.
###3000 But sitting, thinking is an experience,
###3005 as far as I'm concerned.
###3006 And I don't think that we're replacing
###3009 one problem with another.
###3011 I think we're replacing one problem with something that
###3013 is exponentially better.
###3015 And I agree with you that we only have so much time.
###3019 Experiences take time.
###3022 But that's life.
###3024 And the choice of experiences that you do
###3026 are the choice of what you do with your time, that's
###3028 what you do with your life, right?
###3029 As opposed to you're saying that there's more space for stuff
###3035 and therefore, we should spend money on stuff
###3038 because we've got lots of space.
###3041 If you look at demographics and the urbanization of the world,
###3044 we have less space.
###3045 There's seven billion people now, it might be nine billion
###3048 by 2050.
###3051 More people living in cities, less space.
###3053 So I think we have less space, but I
###3055 think the most important part of your question was about time.
###3059 The other thing about experientialism
###3060 is a focus on what you do with your time.
###3064 It's about your experiences.
###3065 And what could be more important than what
###3067 you do with your time, as opposed to the stuff you buy?
###3070 So in terms of the refocus from material things to experiences,
###3076 I think there's a refocus on life and what matters.
###3078 AUDIENCE: My question is about how
###3080 do you with people becoming less and less materialistic--
###3085 compared to even 40 years ago, as Mr. Inglehart said--
###3091 how do you think it's going to influence job market?
###3094 Because not all of us can make a living
###3097 writing programs or writing books.
###3099 Some of us, for example, enjoy creating stuff.
###3104 Sewing or something like that.
###3105 So if we're going to be less materialistic,
###3107 is that going to become a problem for people
###3109 who are making their living producing stuff
###3113 and selling stuff?
###3117 JAMES WALLMAN: It's a very interesting aspect
###3119 of the problem of materialism and the defining problem
###3124 stuffication.
###3125 The shift from the material to experiential economy
###3128 is what's going to happen to some industries.
###3131 With any change, there are winners and there are losers.
###3135 You ever heard of a guy called Ned Ludd, who led the Luddites?
###3138 Ever heard the phrase, the Luddites?
###3140 So when the Industrial Revolution got going in the UK,
###3143 this guy in the north of England smashed some of the machines.
###3147 He may have just been drunk-- it turns out
###3148 he may have not been protesting at all.
###3150 Apparently, if you look into it, it's really odd--
###3152 but he became their hero and they and they
###3154 called themselves Luddites because those machines were
###3157 taking away their jobs, and they were hugely concerned.
###3161 Did that stop the Industrial Revolution?
###3162 No.
###3163 Should it have stopped the Industrial Revolution?
###3165 Not at all.
###3165 Because it was the Industrial Revolution that
###3167 led to the consumer evolution that gave us abundance,
###3171 that gave us everything that we have today.
###3174 So there will definitely be changes in the job market.
###3176 And definitely be changes in terms of what we value.
###3180 And I think it will change for the better.
###3182 You think about 3D printing, what's
###3183 3D printing going to do for all those people who make stuff?
###3188 When you can 3D print it at home,
###3191 it's going to completely change that market, isn't it?
###3193 Why you going to have loads of factories of people producing
###3196 plastic goods, when you can print it at home?
###3199 So the world is changing, anyway.
###3202 And what I'm hoping-- this is my belief-- what materialism
###3208 did for standards of living in the 20th century, which
###3211 was just revolutionized them in a way that just had never
###3214 happened in the whole of human existence.
###3216 I think experientialism could do that for quality of life
###3220 in the 21st century.
###3221 We could end up in this age of leisure,
###3223 which [INAUDIBLE] talked about back in the '30s.
###3226 That's what I hope.
###3227 SPEAKER: OK.
###3228 Why don't we thank our speaker today.
###3231
