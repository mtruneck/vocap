0:0:34,231 --> 0:0:36,267
- You know, high school to college,


2
0:0:36,267 --> 0:0:37,576
it can be a big transition,


3
0:0:37,576 --> 0:0:39,57
especially if you're not from the city,


4
0:0:39,57 --> 0:0:42,239
so-- so we try to help out
with that transition


5
0:0:42,239 --> 0:0:43,741
in a number of ways.


6
0:0:43,741 --> 0:0:45,415
Wow, that's a real accomplishment.


7
0:0:45,415 --> 0:0:46,744
Congratulations.


8
0:0:46,744 --> 0:0:48,913
I mean, you're not in yet, but...


9
0:0:48,913 --> 0:0:50,393
no, things are looking pretty good.


10
0:0:50,393 --> 0:0:52,65
We dc an all-campus picnic,
which is a nice way


11
0:0:52,65 --> 0:0:56,82
for the incoming students
to acclimate themselves


12
0:0:56,82 --> 0:0:58,355
to the college.


13
0:0:58,355 --> 0:1:1,258
For me, the mos! exciting thing
about this place is the classes'


14
0:1:1,258 --> 0:1:2,932
So you don'! want to go
lo college?


15
0:1:2,932 --> 0:1:7,765
You know, I'm not up to date
on the course catalog.


16
0:1:7,765 --> 0:1:10,601
One of the great things
about this school is, you know,


17
0:1:10,601 --> 0:1:13,37
you have a campus called New York City.


18
0:1:13,37 --> 0:1:14,949
Greatest city in the world, they say.


19
0:1:14,949 --> 0:1:17,274
I thought your nay was-
was interesting.


20
0:1:17,274 --> 0:1:19,877
A spell-check might be nice
on than essays.


21
0:1:19,877 --> 0:1:21,448
Planning on taking your boards again?


22
0:1:21,448 --> 0:1:22,891
Love those extracurriculars.


23
0:1:22,891 --> 0:1:25,449
Have you heard about the meal plan?


24
0:1:25,449 --> 0:1:26,884
Fantastic'


25
0:1:26,884 --> 0:1:28,455
Where do you see things going, you know,


26
0:1:28,455 --> 0:2:32,349
after-after college?


27
0:2:32,349 --> 0:2:33,784
Hey!


28
0:2:33,784 --> 0:2:37,955
# Mm, mm, mm-hmm #


29
0:2:37,955 --> 0:2:41,558

# Look at how life has gone today #

0:2:43,861 --> 0:2:45,996
# My sweet love is gone away #


32
0:2:45,996 --> 0:2:48,165
# My sweet love is gone today #


33
0:2:48,165 --> 0:2:53,804
# My sweet love is gone away now #


34
0:2:53,804 --> 0:2:58,308
# Mm, mm! #


35
0:2:58,308 --> 0:3:0,118
# Look at how life has gone away #

0:3:0,118 --> 0:3:2,346
# My sweet love is gone away #


37
0:3:2,346 --> 0:3:4,214
# My sweet love is gone today #


38
0:3:4,214 --> 0:3:8,118
# My sweet love is gone away now #


39
0:3:8,118 --> 0:3:14,525
# Mm-hmm, mm-hmm #


40
0:3:14,525 --> 0:3:24,68
# Mm-hmm, mm-hmm #


41
0:3:24,68 --> 0:3:26,904
- Yours or mine?


42
0:3:26,904 --> 0:3:27,905
- Mine.


43
0:3:27,905 --> 0:3:32,876
You can have it if you want, though.


44
0:3:32,876 --> 0:3:34,445
- Is that a new shirt?


45
0:3:34,445 --> 0:3:36,513
- Uh, yeah, it is.


46
0:3:36,513 --> 0:3:37,754
Do you like it?


47
0:3:37,754 --> 0:3:39,183
- Don'! ask me that.


48
0:3:39,183 --> 0:3:40,417
- WM?


49
0:3:40,417 --> 0:3:41,852
- Because ifs not my job


50
0:3:41,852 --> 0:3:44,288
to make you feel good about yourself anymore.


51
0:3:44,288 --> 0:3:46,924
# Mm-hmm #


52
0:3:46,924 --> 0:3:48,905
# Look at how life has drived away #


53
0:3:48,905 --> 0:3:50,728
# My sweet love is gone away #


54
0:3:50,728 --> 0:3:52,93
# My sweet love is gone today #


55
0:3:52,93 --> 0:3:56,767
# My sweet love is gone away now #


56
0:3:56,767 --> 0:3:57,835
# Mm-hmm #


57
0:3:57,835 --> 0:3:58,837
- That'll be all for you?


58
0:3:58,837 --> 0:4:0,771
- Hmm?
- Anything else?


59
0:4:0,771 --> 0:4:7,111

60
0:4:7,111 --> 0:4:9,747
- That's a nice shirt.


61
0:4:9,747 --> 0:4:11,215
- Thanks'


62
0:4:11,215 --> 0:4:13,617
# Oh, my baby #

# Oh, my love #


64
0:4:15,619 --> 0:4:19,389

0:4:39,81 --> 0:4:44,47
# Mm-hmm, mm-hmm #


71
0:4:44,47 --> 0:4:47,117
# Mm-hmm,
mm-hmm #


72
0:4:47,117 --> 0:4:48,318
- Hello?


73
0:4:48,318 --> 0:4:49,593
- Jesse Fisher'?


74
0:4:49,593 --> 0:4:50,654
- Yeah?


75
0:4:50,654 --> 0:4:51,998
- It's your favorite Communist.


76
0:4:51,998 --> 0:4:53,367
- Professor Peter Hoberg?


77
0:4:53,367 --> 0:4:55,225
- Screw you.
I'm not a Communist


78
0:4:55,225 --> 0:4:56,326
How you doing?


79
0:4:56,326 --> 0:4:57,828
- Oh, you know.


80
0:4:57,828 --> 0:5:0,898
- Listen, I don't want in
lake up too much of your time,


81
0:5:0,898 --> 0:5:2,173
but here's why I'm calling.


82
0:5:2,173 --> 0:5:4,1
Ever since I announced that I was packing it in,


83
0:5:4,1 --> 0:5:6,236
funny, but this whole place has finally decided


84
0:5:6,236 --> 0:5:7,91
that they don'! really hate me
after all.


85
0:5:7,91 --> 0:5:10,607
Now, I know Ohio is not
as glamorous as New York,


86
0:5:10,607 --> 0:5:12,952
but they're throwing me
a retirement dinner thing


87
0:5:12,952 --> 0:5:14,252
at the end of the month,


88
0:5:14,252 --> 0:5:16,547
and they asked me to invite any former students


89
0:5:16,547 --> 0:5:18,858
that might want to lie and say
some nice things about me.


90
0:5:18,858 --> 0:5:21,552
And since you're one of
the great liars that I know...


91
0:5:21,552 --> 0:5:22,719
- When is it?


92
0:5:22,719 --> 0:5:23,858
- Weekend of the 25th.


93
0:5:23,858 --> 0:5:25,622
You know, check your schedule.


94
0:5:25,622 --> 0:5:27,624
- OK!!-


95
0:5:27,624 --> 0:5:30,394
Checking now.


96
0:5:30,394 --> 0:5:37,167
Uh, looks like I'd have to shift
some things around, but yeah.


97
0:5:37,167 --> 0:6:12,736
I'll be there.


98
0:6:12,736 --> 0:6:16,874
- Hi.


99
0:6:16,874 --> 0:6:18,41
Look at this.


100
0:6:18,41 --> 0:6:30,754
Haw are you?


101
0:6:30,754 --> 0:7:4,554
Ah.


102
0:7:4,554 --> 0:7:6,89
- Jesse.
- Yeah, hi.


103
0:7:6,89 --> 0:7:7,724
- Hi, I'm David.
This is Susan.


104
0:7:7,724 --> 0:7:8,825
- Hi.
- Hey.


105
0:7:8,825 --> 0:7:10,294
- Peter warned you that we'd be here?


106
0:7:10,294 --> 0:7:12,763
- He did.
He did, yeah.


107
0:7:12,763 --> 0:7:14,731
We're making him take care
of us while we're here.


108
0:7:14,731 --> 0:7:15,972
How was your drive?


109
0:7:15,972 --> 0:7:17,674
- It was good, yeah.
Pleasant, actually,


110
0:7:17,674 --> 0:7:19,403
- Peter, Jesse's here!


111
0:7:19,403 --> 0:7:20,61
- So it's good to be back?


112
0:7:20,61 --> 0:7:21,845
- Yeah.
Yeah, ifs weird.


113
0:7:21,845 --> 0:7:22,977
I drove up the hill.


114
0:7:22,977 --> 0:7:24,408
I suddenly felt like I was seeing


115
0:7:24,408 --> 0:7:25,752
an ex-girlfriend
or something.


116
0:7:25,752 --> 0:7:28,45
- The one that got away.
- Exactly.


117
0:7:28,45 --> 0:7:29,78
- Zibby loves it here so much,


118
0:7:29,78 --> 0:7:31,158
she get sad to come home on breaks.


119
0:7:31,158 --> 0:7:32,249
- Zibby?


120
0:7:32,249 --> 0:7:33,65
- Sorry.
Elizabeth, our daughter.


121
0:7:33,65 --> 0:7:34,789
a sophomore.
- Ah.


122
0:7:34,789 --> 0:7:35,856
- She's in the improv group.


123
0:7:35,856 --> 0:7:37,332
We came up to see one of her shows.


124
0:7:37,332 --> 0:7:38,956
- How was it?
- Hilarious.


125
0:7:38,956 --> 0:7:41,458
- Uh, filthy but hilarious.


126
0:7:41,458 --> 0:7:42,96
- Sc how do you guys know Peter?


127
0:7:42,96 --> 0:7:44,695
- He was my camp counselor.


128
0:7:44,695 --> 0:7:46,229
- No way.


129
0:7:46,229 --> 0:7:49,433
- He made us sing pro-union
songs around the campfire.


130
0:7:49,433 --> 0:7:51,501
# You mus! stand up
for your brother #


131
0:7:51,501 --> 0:7:54,4
# So you won't die for the man #


132
0:7:54,4 --> 0:7:56,707
# Stand up for your brother
so you won't die for- #


133
0:7:56,707 --> 0:7:58,508
He never writes.
He never calls,


134
0:7:58,508 --> 0:8:0,277
- Oh, hey.


135
0:8:0,277 --> 0:8:2,12
- Let me look at you.


136
0:8:2,12 --> 0:8:3,513
Not bad.


137
0:8:3,513 --> 0:8:5,248
Who's hungry?


138
0:8:5,248 --> 0:8:6,95
- I'm hungry-
- okay, let's go.


139
0:8:6,95 --> 0:8:10,554
We've got reservations.


140
0:8:10,554 --> 0:8:12,322
Oh, man, 37 years.


141
0:8:12,322 --> 0:8:13,69
Can you believe it?


142
0:8:13,69 --> 0:8:18,161
Native New Yorker spends 37 years in a county


143
0:8:18,161 --> 0:8:20,497
where the tallest building's nine stories.


144
0:8:20,497 --> 0:8:23,367
Oh, my.


145
0:8:23,367 --> 0:8:25,211
- How are you feeling about it all'!


146
0:8:25,211 --> 0:8:26,341
- The retirement?
- Yeah.


147
0:8:26,341 --> 0:8:28,138
- Oh, I don't know.


148
0:8:28,138 --> 0:8:30,7
Another year of faculty meetings,


149
0:8:30,7 --> 0:8:33,21
I'd throw myself
off that nine-story building.


150
0:8:33,21 --> 0:8:37,447
the admissions game, buddy?


151
0:8:37,447 --> 0:8:41,451
- "How's
the admissions game, buddy?"


152
0:8:41,451 --> 0:8:43,22
Whoa, is that Professor Fairfield?


153
0:8:43,22 --> 0:8:44,54
- Yeah.


154
0:8:44,54 --> 0:8:46,56
- Wow, she looks fantastic!


155
0:8:46,56 --> 0:8:47,457
Professor!


156
0:8:47,457 --> 0:8:49,359
What is she like?
Is she cool?


157
0:8:49,359 --> 0:8:50,927
- She's definitely not warm.


158
0:8:50,927 --> 0:8:54,131
- I loved her British Romantic lit class.


159
0:8:54,131 --> 0:8:56,466
She was, like, the belt teacher I had here.


160
0:8:56,466 --> 0:9:1,571
She was, like, the second best
teacher I had here.


161
0:9:1,571 --> 0:9:3,24
- Unbelievable.


162
0:9:3,24 --> 0:9:4,941
You are unbelievable.


163
0:9:4,941 --> 0:9:15,852
- What?


164
0:9:15,852 --> 0:9:21,24
- Tell her how you feel,


165
0:9:21,24 --> 0:9:22,504
- Jesse, this is my daughter, Zibby.


166
0:9:22,504 --> 0:9:23,56
. HO)'-


167
0:9:23,56 --> 0:9:25,429
- Hi.
Hello.


168
0:9:25,429 --> 0:9:26,909
- Peter, should we follow you?


169
0:9:26,909 --> 0:9:32,235
- If you think that's wise.


170
0:9:32,235 --> 0:9:35,238
- And he's like, "I had it
up to here with America


171
0:9:35,238 --> 0:9:37,412
and its repressive, regressive,
fascist, ?whatever.


172
0:9:37,412 --> 0:9:38,944
- I sound like that'?
That's how I sound?


173
0:9:38,944 --> 0:9:40,115
- You do.
You sound like that


174
0:9:40,115 --> 0:9:41,511
And he gets up in front of the class.


175
0:9:41,511 --> 0:9:43,287
He says, 'I just-l couldn't
take it anymore,


176
0:9:43,287 --> 0:9:47,284
so I picked up my life,
and I moved to France."


177
0:9:47,284 --> 0:9:49,458
- This is being ludicrously
misreported, by the way.


178
0:9:49,458 --> 0:9:50,787
- So I raised my hand.


179
0:9:50,787 --> 0:9:52,631
I said, 'Wait, wail, wait, wait, wail, Peter.


180
0:9:52,631 --> 0:9:55,425
"You're telling us you got
so angry at this country


181
0:9:55,425 --> 0:9:58,295
that you moved to France?"


182
0:9:58,295 --> 0:10:1,131
And Peter says, "Yeah.


183
0:10:1,131 --> 0:10:3,967
Well, I had a Fulbright."


184
0:10:3,967 --> 0:10:5,311
- Yeah, well, yeah, if I told you


185
0:10:5,311 --> 0:10:6,941
what this putz was like when he was here,


186
0:10:6,941 --> 0:10:8,144
he'd run out of the room crying.


187
0:10:8,144 --> 0:10:9,413
- That's probably true.


188
0:10:9,413 --> 0:10:11,318
- Well, what were you like when you were here?


189
0:10:11,318 --> 0:10:14,544
- I wan very handsome, wasn't I?


190
0:10:14,544 --> 0:10:15,853
Am I remembering that correctly?


191
0:10:15,853 --> 0:10:17,121
- No, I don't remember that.


192
0:10:17,121 --> 0:10:19,316
But what I do remember is you being a real jerk


193
0:10:19,316 --> 0:10:21,318
in your parents on graduation weekend.


194
0:10:21,318 --> 0:10:22,686
He didn't want to leave.


195
0:10:22,686 --> 0:10:23,954
- Ifs true.


196
0:10:23,954 --> 0:10:26,823
And I blamed my parents,
weirdly, all four of them.


197
0:10:26,823 --> 0:10:28,792
Like it was their fault college was ending.


198
0:10:28,792 --> 0:10:29,931
- Don'! do that to us.


199
0:10:29,931 --> 0:10:32,95
- No, I won't.
- She says that now.


200
0:10:32,95 --> 0:10:35,465
- So your parents told me
you're in the improv group?


201
0:10:35,465 --> 0:10:36,633
- Yeah.


202
0:10:36,633 --> 0:10:37,701
- How's that?


203
0:10:37,701 --> 0:10:39,469
- We the best I love it


204
0:10:39,469 --> 0:10:40,778
- What do you love about it'?


205
0:10:40,778 --> 0:10:45,342
- Um, I think I love how terrifying it is


206
0:10:45,342 --> 0:10:48,678
and haw you have in say "yes" to everything.


207
0:10:48,678 --> 0:10:50,68
- Uh, sorry, what does that moan?


208
0:10:50,68 --> 0:10:52,319
- Ifs, like, the only rule of improv.


209
0:10:52,319 --> 0:10:53,624
You can never say "no."


210
0:10:53,624 --> 0:10:56,686
You have to say "yes" and then add something.


211
0:10:56,686 --> 0:10:59,256
Like, uh-like, look.


212
0:10:59,256 --> 0:11:1,791
Um, okay, Mom, you and I


213
0:11:1,791 --> 0:11:4,127
have been wandering in the desert for days,


214
0:11:4,127 --> 0:11:6,29
and we're about to die, okay'?


215
0:11:6,29 --> 0:11:7,264
- OK!!-


216
0:11:7,264 --> 0:11:14,704
- Okay, and I say, "Hand me that lemonade, ?


217
0:11:14,704 --> 0:11:19,543
So hand me that lemonade.


218
0:11:19,543 --> 0:11:22,78
- Jesus, Susan, hand her the goddamn lemonade.


219
0:11:22,78 --> 0:11:23,213
- Never mind.


220
0:11:23,213 --> 0:11:27,217
Jesse, hand me that lemonade.


221
0:11:27,217 --> 0:11:30,52
Thank you.


222
0:11:30,52 --> 0:11:32,222
M mm-


223
0:11:32,222 --> 0:11:33,566
Sweet, just the way I like it.


224
0:11:33,566 --> 0:11:39,162
- I nailed this.


225
0:11:39,162 --> 0:11:40,233
- It doesn't make sense.


226
0:11:40,233 --> 0:11:41,565
We're in the desert


227
0:11:41,565 --> 0:11:46,937
I mean, where would we get lemonade?


228
0:11:46,937 --> 0:11:48,212
- It's great seeing you guys.


229
0:11:48,212 --> 0:11:49,583
- So what was your major'?


230
0:11:49,583 --> 0:11:52,42
- I was English with a minor in history,


231
0:11:52,42 --> 0:11:53,954
just to make sure I was fully unemployable.


232
0:11:53,954 --> 0:11:55,424
- Right.
- What about you?


233
0:11:55,424 --> 0:11:56,513
- Drama.


234
0:11:56,513 --> 0:11:57,914
I mean, not officially yet,


235
0:11:57,914 --> 0:12:0,2
'cause my dad's not totally
thrilled with the idea,


236
0:12:0,2 --> 0:12:2,752
so maybe also art history?


237
0:12:2,752 --> 0:12:4,921
- I'm just happy you go to clan occasionally.


238
0:12:4,921 --> 0:12:7,27
I thought maybe you just
improvised all day long.


239
0:12:7,27 --> 0:12:8,425
- Nope.


240
0:12:8,425 --> 0:12:9,793
I mean, I do, I guess.


241
0:12:9,793 --> 0:12:11,239
Have you ever thought about that'!


242
0:12:11,239 --> 0:12:12,395
- About what?


243
0:12:12,395 --> 0:12:15,31
- How everything in life
is basically improvised?


244
0:12:15,31 --> 0:12:16,333
There's no script.


245
0:12:16,333 --> 0:12:19,369
We're just making this up as we go.


246
0:12:19,369 --> 0:12:20,704
- That's true.


247
0:12:20,704 --> 0:12:21,805
- So yeah.


248
0:12:21,805 --> 0:12:24,241
Well, improv is deep, man.


249
0:12:24,241 --> 0:12:25,709
- Well, we're about in head out
- Oh.


250
0:12:25,709 --> 0:12:27,781
- Pleasure to meet you, Jesse.
- Yeah. yeah. you too.


251
0:12:27,781 --> 0:12:29,81
- Take care.
Bye.


252
0:12:29,81 --> 0:12:30,684
- So I'll-
I'll see you around, I guess.


253
0:12:30,684 --> 0:12:32,749
- Yeah, yeah, see you around.
- Okay.


254
0:12:32,749 --> 0:12:33,888
- It was nice to meet you.


255
0:12:33,888 --> 0:12:35,452
- Yeah, you too.


256
0:12:35,452 --> 0:12:41,258
- See you later.
- Okay, bye.


257
0:12:41,258 --> 0:12:50,1
. Enjoy college.


258
0:12:50,1 --> 0:12:53,77
- You wearing a tie tonight'?


259
0:12:53,77 --> 0:12:57,107
' Huh?


260
0:12:57,107 --> 0:13:0,41
- What can you say, really?


261
0:13:0,41 --> 0:13:3,58
People get up and say
all this great stuff about you.


262
0:13:3,58 --> 0:13:4,981
You know, I'm thinking,


263
0:13:4,981 --> 0:13:13,99
'Who in the hell
are they talking about?"


264
0:13:13,99 --> 0:13:16,793
We just, where does the lime go?


265
0:13:16,793 --> 0:13:18,0
This seems impossible.


266
0:13:18,0 --> 0:13:19,429
37 years.


267
0:13:19,429 --> 0:13:23,667
37.


268
0:13:23,667 --> 0:13:25,341
There comes a time in a man's life


269
0:13:25,341 --> 0:13:34,844
when it hurts to do the math.


270
0:13:34,844 --> 0:13:38,181
You know, I worry that I've been hero so long


271
0:13:38,181 --> 0:13:43,353
that I'll be lousy being anyplace else.


272
0:13:43,353 --> 0:13:59,369
Oh, well, I guess I'll find out very shortly.


273
0:13:59,369 --> 0:14:2,806
Um, hey, thanks for the chicken.


274
0:14:2,806 --> 0:14:8,144
It was a little cold, but still I...


275
0:14:8,144 --> 0:14:10,98
Think nice thoughts about me when I'm gone,


276
0:14:10,98 --> 0:14:19,656
if you can.


277
0:14:19,656 --> 0:14:22,25
- No, they did it at Macalester.


278
0:14:22,25 --> 0:14:23,403
I really think it could work here.


279
0:14:23,403 --> 0:14:24,828
- Well, it sounds great.


280
0:14:24,828 --> 0:14:27,33
I tell you, talk about it on Monday.


281
0:14:27,33 --> 0:14:29,499
- Oh, sure.


282
0:14:29,499 --> 0:14:30,8
Night, Jesse'


283
0:14:30,8 --> 0:14:34,637
- Yeah, good night.


284
0:14:34,637 --> 0:14:37,374
- It's a good idea, though.


285
0:14:37,374 --> 0:14:42,245
a terrible idea.


286
0:14:42,245 --> 0:14:45,14
Oh, what a disaster.


287
0:14:45,14 --> 0:14:47,517
- What-no, it was nice


288
0:14:47,517 --> 0:14:53,59
- You're not half the liar you used to be.


289
0:14:53,59 --> 0:14:55,925
You know, it really means a lot to me


290
0:14:55,925 --> 0:14:57,132
that you came out for this.


291
0:14:57,132 --> 0:14:58,432
- How could I miss it'?


292
0:14:58,432 --> 0:15:0,136
You're the second best teacher I had here.


293
0:15:0,136 --> 0:15:6,903
- I'm serious.


294
0:15:6,903 --> 0:15:8,438
I'm gonna take off.


295
0:15:8,438 --> 0:15:9,611
- Well, I'll come with you.


296
0:15:9,611 --> 0:15:11,441
- Oh, no, no, no, you slay.


297
0:15:11,441 --> 0:15:40,3
I want to be alone for a bit.


298
0:15:40,3 --> 0:15:42,238
- I feel you, man.


299
0:15:42,238 --> 0:15:47,71
A lot of information in trees.


300
0:15:47,71 --> 0:15:50,246
- Uh...


301
0:15:50,246 --> 0:15:52,315
- How's your night going?


302
0:15:52,315 --> 0:15:53,416
- Fine.


303
0:15:53,416 --> 0:15:56,653
- Is your name.


304
0:15:56,653 --> 0:15:58,788
Ethan?


305
0:15:58,788 --> 0:16:1,324
- No.
WW!


306
0:16:1,324 --> 0:16:2,826
- You look like an Ethan to me.


307
0:16:2,826 --> 0:16:4,661
- My name's not Ethan.


308
0:16:4,661 --> 0:16:6,835
- How cool would that have been
if that was your name


309
0:16:6,835 --> 0:16:8,364
and l just, like...


310
0:16:8,364 --> 0:16:11,0
Knew it?


311
0:16:11,0 --> 0:16:12,735
Are you a student here?


312
0:16:12,735 --> 0:16:15,738
- Uh, no, but thank you tor thinking that.


313
0:16:15,738 --> 0:16:16,806
You?


314
0:16:16,806 --> 0:16:18,41
- Nah, man.


315
0:16:18,41 --> 0:16:20,176
I'm just here visiting a buddy of mine.


316
0:16:20,176 --> 0:16:23,746
But it's not a bad place
to kill a little time, huh?


317
0:16:23,746 --> 0:16:25,582
I'm Nat.


318
0:16:25,582 --> 0:16:27,684
- I'm Jesse.


319
0:16:27,684 --> 0:16:30,19
- Do you hear that music, Ethan?


320
0:16:30,19 --> 0:16:32,655
It sounds like a celebration.


321
0:16:32,655 --> 0:16:34,924
I say we do a little sherlocking,


322
0:16:34,924 --> 0:16:37,126
find out where ifs coming from going on.


323
0:16:37,126 --> 0:16:39,529
- No-
- Don't say no.


324
0:16:39,529 --> 0:16:47,604
Fortune never smiles on those who say no.


325
0:16:47,604 --> 0:16:50,39
# Everybody get on the floor #


326
0:16:50,39 --> 0:16:52,208
# Everybody wanna uh-uh-uh #


327
0:16:52,208 --> 0:16:54,711
# Everybody get on the floor #


328
0:16:54,711 --> 0:16:56,679
# Everybody wanna uh-uh-uh #


329
0:16:56,679 --> 0:16:58,181
# Everybody 901-" #


330
0:16:58,181 --> 0:17:1,417
- I would get you a beer,
but alcohol's for suckers, man.


331
0:17:1,417 --> 0:17:2,819
- Uh, yeah.


332
0:17:2,819 --> 0:17:4,888
Listen, Nat, this isn't really my scene anymore.


333
0:17:4,888 --> 0:17:6,356
I'm gonna-


334
0:17:6,356 --> 0:17:8,496
- Give yourself five minutes
to adapt, my brother.


335
0:17:8,496 --> 0:17:19,903
Change is never easy.


336
0:17:19,903 --> 0:17:22,71
Tell me this.


337
0:17:22,71 --> 0:17:25,241
What are your thoughts on crop circles?


338
0:17:25,241 --> 0:17:27,343
- Uh, I don't have any.


339
0:17:27,343 --> 0:17:31,114
some seriously weird shit going on, bro.


340
0:17:31,114 --> 0:17:33,117
You think it's just a bunch
of drunk English guys


341
0:17:33,117 --> 0:17:34,45
with planks and rope?


342
0:17:34,45 --> 0:17:36,286
You're a fool.
- Mm-hmm.


343
0:17:36,286 --> 0:17:39,222
- Spend some time with those patterns.


344
0:17:39,222 --> 0:17:41,9
You can feel it.


345
0:17:41,9 --> 0:17:44,26
Somethings trying to communicate with us.


346
0:17:44,26 --> 0:17:48,698
It should be on the front page
of every paper every day.


347
0:17:48,698 --> 0:17:51,2
- Okay.
Thanks.


348
0:17:51,2 --> 0:17:52,302
- Ha?


349
0:17:52,302 --> 0:17:54,103
I thought that was you,


350
0:17:54,103 --> 0:17:56,272
- Hi.
- How'd you and up here?


351
0:17:56,272 --> 0:17:57,547
- He made a friend.


352
0:17:57,547 --> 0:17:59,776
- Yeah, yeah, I-yeah


353
0:17:59,776 --> 0:18:1,21
- Look at you.


354
0:18:1,21 --> 0:18:3,78
You're, like, back in college.


355
0:18:3,78 --> 0:18:4,881
- Whee!


356
0:18:4,881 --> 0:18:7,25
- How does it feel?


357
0:18:7,25 --> 0:18:8,685
- Oh, this is Vanessa.


358
0:18:8,685 --> 0:18:10,219
- Hey.
- Hi.


359
0:18:10,219 --> 0:18:11,46
- Tm Nat

360
0:18:11,46 --> 0:18:12,49
- Jesse's an alum.


361
0:18:12,49 --> 0:18:13,797
We had brunch this morning.


362
0:18:13,797 --> 0:18:15,959
I think my mom has a little crush on him.


363
0:18:15,959 --> 0:18:17,166
- You went here?


364
0:18:17,166 --> 0:18:18,227
- I did, yeah


365
0:18:18,227 --> 0:18:19,629
- When'd you graduate?


366
0:18:19,629 --> 0:18:23,6
- Oh, man, it was, uh, -.


367
0:18:23,6 --> 0:18:26,636
That was when we were born.


368
0:18:26,636 --> 0:18:28,771
- Yeah, yeah


369
0:18:28,771 --> 0:18:30,473
I'm old.


370
0:18:30,473 --> 0:18:34,77
- But you look good.


371
0:18:34,77 --> 0:18:48,291
And you're overdressed.


372
0:18:48,291 --> 0:18:51,294
# Hotter, sweeter, taller... #


373
0:18:51,294 --> 0:18:53,62
- That's better.


374
0:18:53,62 --> 0:18:54,998
# Hotter, sweeter #


375
0:18:54,998 --> 0:18:57,433
- Why do I like this guy so much?


376
0:18:57,433 --> 0:19:0,97
- Because he's likable.


377
0:19:0,97 --> 0:19:2,805

378
0:19:2,805 --> 0:19:5,116

0:19:39,142 --> 0:19:40,343
- Hi.


396
0:19:40,343 --> 0:19:41,711
- Can we talk'?


397
0:19:41,711 --> 0:19:44,13
- Yeah.
Yeah, sure, okay.


398
0:19:44,13 --> 0:19:45,648
See you tomorrow'?


399
0:19:45,648 --> 0:19:47,383
- Yeah, yeah.
See you then.


400
0:19:47,383 --> 0:19:49,485
- OK!!-


401
0:19:49,485 --> 0:19:54,724
- Hey, Vanessa.


402
0:19:54,724 --> 0:19:57,86
- Don'! sweat that guy.


403
0:19:57,86 --> 0:20:1,3
She only had eyes for you.


404
0:20:1,3 --> 0:20:2,899
- OK!!-


405
0:20:2,899 --> 0:20:4,4
Good night, Nat


406
0:20:4,4 --> 0:20:57,954
- Good night, Ethan.


407
0:20:57,954 --> 0:21:0,89
- Can I help you?


408
0:21:0,89 --> 0:21:1,424
. Surf!-


409
0:21:1,424 --> 0:21:3,126
I just-


410
0:21:3,126 --> 0:21:4,794
just the best book of all time.


411
0:21:4,794 --> 0:21:8,131
I just like holding it, I guess


412
0:21:8,131 --> 0:21:9,866
- Best book of all time?


413
0:21:9,866 --> 0:21:11,334
- Well, one of them, sure.


414
0:21:11,334 --> 0:21:13,315
- Have you ever noticed how everyone around here


415
0:21:13,315 --> 0:21:15,271
speaks in wild hyperbole?


416
0:21:15,271 --> 0:21:16,606
Everything's the best.


417
0:21:16,606 --> 0:21:18,808
Like, 'He's the best professor ever, '


418
0:21:18,808 --> 0:21:21,444
or, "This is the best patty" melt
on the planet, ?


419
0:21:21,444 --> 0:21:23,288
as if they've sampled every possible variety


420
0:21:23,288 --> 0:21:24,981
of professor and patty melt,


421
0:21:24,981 --> 0:21:33,322
which is, as we know, logistically impossible.


422
0:21:33,322 --> 0:21:37,76
- ORGY-


423
0:21:37,76 --> 0:21:43,833
- All right, do we have enough time for that'?


424
0:21:43,833 --> 0:21:45,168
- Hey.
- Hey.


425
0:21:45,168 --> 0:21:46,17
- Am I super lab?


426
0:21:46,17 --> 0:21:47,67
- Uh, no.
You wan! a coffee?


427
0:21:47,67 --> 0:21:50,673
- No, I'll just drink yours.


428
0:21:50,673 --> 0:21:52,108
- You okay?


429
0:21:52,108 --> 0:21:58,848
- I don't know yet


430
0:21:58,848 --> 0:22:3,386
I smell like beer.
Do you smell that'?


431
0:22:3,386 --> 0:22:8,157
- Yeah, actually, you do.


432
0:22:8,157 --> 0:22:12,28
- I-I need to excuse myself
just-


433
0:22:12,28 --> 0:22:25,808
just for a-


434
0:22:25,808 --> 0:22:27,71
- Sorry about that.


435
0:22:27,71 --> 0:22:29,946
Back there.


436
0:22:29,946 --> 0:22:31,722
You walked away, and I was just wondering


437
0:22:31,722 --> 0:22:36,152
why I was being rude to someone
who loves the same writer I do.


438
0:22:36,152 --> 0:22:39,222
And I don'! have an answer
for that


439
0:22:39,222 --> 0:22:41,557
- OK!!-


440
0:22:41,557 --> 0:22:43,726
- Okay, so yeah, um,


441
0:22:43,726 --> 0:22:44,861
I'll just-


442
0:22:44,861 --> 0:22:47,33
- My grades tanked senior year.


443
0:22:47,33 --> 0:22:50,66
That book was the only thing I wanted to read.


444
0:22:50,66 --> 0:22:51,367
You liking it?


445
0:22:51,367 --> 0:22:54,604
- Uh, yeah.


446
0:22:54,604 --> 0:22:56,516
It's my second time reading it, actually.


447
0:22:56,516 --> 0:22:57,673
- WWI.


448
0:22:57,673 --> 0:22:58,709
That's impressive.


449
0:22:58,709 --> 0:22:59,842
Ifs not short.


450
0:22:59,842 --> 0:23:1,49
- Yeah, I know.


451
0:23:1,49 --> 0:23:2,682
- You know, he said the purpose of fiction


452
0:23:2,682 --> 0:23:4,247
was to combat loneliness.


453
0:23:4,247 --> 0:23:5,915
good.


454
0:23:5,915 --> 0:23:7,316
I never heard that.


455
0:23:7,316 --> 0:23:8,384
- Yeah.


456
0:23:8,384 --> 0:23:9,919
Well, on the other hand,


457
0:23:9,919 --> 0:23:12,161
spending most of your time
with an 1,100-page book


458
0:23:12,161 --> 0:23:14,101
tends to put a dent in your social life.


459
0:23:14,101 --> 0:23:16,192
- Yeah.


460
0:23:16,192 --> 0:23:20,696
Loneliness simultaneously
increased and decreased.


461
0:23:20,696 --> 0:23:22,531
. HO)'-


462
0:23:22,531 --> 0:23:24,467
- What, you guys know each other?


463
0:23:24,467 --> 0:23:27,27
- Yeah, we had Symbolic Logic first semester.


464
0:23:27,27 --> 0:23:28,771
Zibby.


465
0:23:28,771 --> 0:23:30,873
- Right.
Dean, hi.


466
0:23:30,873 --> 0:23:32,608
- Hey.
- I'm Joan, by the way.


467
0:23:32,608 --> 0:23:36,479
- OK!!-


468
0:23:36,479 --> 0:23:38,114
- Hmm.


469
0:23:38,114 --> 0:23:39,615
Interesting guy.


470
0:23:39,615 --> 0:23:40,783
- Yeah.


471
0:23:40,783 --> 0:23:43,19
I can'! believe
he's even back here.


472
0:23:43,19 --> 0:23:44,787
- Why?
What do you moan?


473
0:23:44,787 --> 0:23:47,623
- He had a manic episode last year.


474
0:23:47,623 --> 0:23:49,926
Eventually, they look him lo a hospital


475
0:23:49,926 --> 0:23:52,795
and, I don't know, calmed him down, I guess.


476
0:23:52,795 --> 0:23:57,466
He's supposed to be, like,
the smartest guy ever.


477
0:23:57,466 --> 0:23:58,639
- Everything okay?


478
0:23:58,639 --> 0:24:1,103
- Yeah, everything's great.


479
0:24:1,103 --> 0:24:2,605
I puked.


480
0:24:2,605 --> 0:24:3,973
- On.


481
0:24:3,973 --> 0:24:5,146
- That's gross.


482
0:24:5,146 --> 0:24:6,621
Sorry, you did not need to hear that


483
0:24:6,621 --> 0:24:13,149
Come on, let's-let's walk.


484
0:24:13,149 --> 0:24:14,629
My parents really liked you.


485
0:24:14,629 --> 0:24:15,918
- Oh.
nice.


486
0:24:15,918 --> 0:24:18,54
I like them.


487
0:24:18,54 --> 0:24:20,589
You're really lucky to have parents like that.


488
0:24:20,589 --> 0:24:22,124
- Like what?


489
0:24:22,124 --> 0:24:23,826
- Like, I don't know.


490
0:24:23,826 --> 0:24:25,995
Around, first of all.


491
0:24:25,995 --> 0:24:28,764
Still together so they
can fret over you as a team.


492
0:24:28,764 --> 0:24:30,333
- Yeah, I guess.


493
0:24:30,333 --> 0:24:33,2
I like them best when they're
not being so parental,


494
0:24:33,2 --> 0:24:36,772
which is, like, 1% of the time.


495
0:24:36,772 --> 0:24:39,442
Oh, I thought of this great trick


496
0:24:39,442 --> 0:24:40,683
for having them annoy me less.


497
0:24:40,683 --> 0:24:41,849
Want to hear if?
- Okay.


498
0:24:41,849 --> 0:24:43,688
- Okay, I decided to treat my parents


499
0:24:43,688 --> 0:24:45,159
like they're always drunk.


500
0:24:45,159 --> 0:24:47,116
No, really, it works.


501
0:24:47,116 --> 0:24:49,719
Any time they say something
irritating or offensive,


502
0:24:49,719 --> 0:24:52,355
I'm just like, "Oh, I can't get mad at them.


503
0:24:52,355 --> 0:24:54,357
They're drunk.
It's not their fault."


504
0:24:54,357 --> 0:24:56,634
And why should I take advice
from drunk people seriously?


505
0:24:56,634 --> 0:24:58,527
- That's great.


506
0:24:58,527 --> 0:25:0,463
- Do you like classical music?


507
0:25:0,463 --> 0:25:2,31
- Yeah, sure.


508
0:25:2,31 --> 0:25:5,201
- Okay, I took this music survey claw last year.


509
0:25:5,201 --> 0:25:7,36
Oh, my God!


510
0:25:7,36 --> 0:25:12,41
It totally changed my life.


511
0:25:12,41 --> 0:25:14,977
I'm really happy I ran into you last night


512
0:25:14,977 --> 0:25:16,746
- Yeah, yeah, mo too.


513
0:25:16,746 --> 0:25:20,383
Ifs random.


514
0:25:20,383 --> 0:25:23,185
Who was that guy?


515
0:25:23,185 --> 0:25:24,72
- What guy?


516
0:25:24,72 --> 0:25:26,288
- The-last night, that guy.


517
0:25:26,288 --> 0:25:31,227
- Oh, his name is Eric.


518
0:25:31,227 --> 0:25:33,496
- Erie


519
0:25:33,496 --> 0:25:36,65
ls Eric your fella?


520
0:25:36,65 --> 0:25:39,35
- No.


521
0:25:39,35 --> 0:25:42,304
No.


522
0:25:42,304 --> 0:25:46,842
You know, I think I like almost
everything about this place


523
0:25:46,842 --> 0:25:49,612
but the dude situation.


524
0:25:49,612 --> 0:25:51,47
- Not great?


525
0:25:51,47 --> 0:25:52,748
- No one, like, dates.


526
0:25:52,748 --> 0:25:57,386
so casual about it all.


527
0:25:57,386 --> 0:25:59,755
- Same as when I was here.


528
0:25:59,755 --> 0:26:2,892
- Yeah.


529
0:26:2,892 --> 0:26:12,802
I guess there's part of me
that's a little old-fashioned.


530
0:26:12,802 --> 0:26:14,97
- Well, on behalf


531
0:26:14,97 --> 0:26:19,608
of all current and former
18- to 22-year-olds,


532
0:26:19,608 --> 0:26:22,278
I'd like to apologize.


533
0:26:22,278 --> 0:26:24,46
Forgive us.


534
0:26:24,46 --> 0:26:25,881
Seriously.


535
0:26:25,881 --> 0:26:33,923
We know not what we do.


536
0:26:33,923 --> 0:26:35,13
- I think one of the things


537
0:26:35,13 --> 0:26:37,359
I loved the most about being here


538
0:26:37,359 --> 0:26:40,62
was the feeling that anything was possible.


539
0:26:40,62 --> 0:26:43,299
It's just infinite choices ahead of you.


540
0:26:43,299 --> 0:26:47,269
You'd get out of school,
and anything could happen.


541
0:26:47,269 --> 0:26:50,673
And then you do get out, and...


542
0:26:50,673 --> 0:26:51,948
life happens, you know'?


543
0:26:51,948 --> 0:26:53,409
Decisions gel made.


544
0:26:53,409 --> 0:26:56,445
And then all those many choices
you had in from of you


545
0:26:56,445 --> 0:26:58,314
are no longer really there.


546
0:26:58,314 --> 0:26:59,919
At a certain point, you just got to go,


547
0:26:59,919 --> 0:27:2,485
"Oh, I guess this is new its going down.


548
0:27:2,485 --> 0:27:7,156
And there's just something
a little depressing about that.


549
0:27:7,156 --> 0:27:11,46
- Well, don't you think you're
romanticizing youth a bit much?


550
0:27:11,46 --> 0:27:14,163
You know, 'cause it's just as hard and annoying


551
0:27:14,163 --> 0:27:17,7
lo be young an it is to be old, I'm assuming.


552
0:27:17,7 --> 0:27:20,147
Nut that you're old,
'cause, you know, you're not


553
0:27:20,147 --> 0:27:24,673
- Look, I get the whole
努e're all equal" argument,


554
0:27:24,673 --> 0:27:27,443
and it's kind of true,
but it's also kind of not true.


555
0:27:27,443 --> 0:27:32,348
Like, okay, I feel different now
than I felt when I was here,


556
0:27:32,348 --> 0:27:36,318
and I hate to break this lo you,
but so will you.


557
0:27:36,318 --> 0:27:38,187
- So you're saying things suck?


558
0:27:38,187 --> 0:27:40,289
I should prepare myself for suckiness?


559
0:27:40,289 --> 0:27:43,626
- No, a liberal arts education
solves all your problems.


560
0:27:43,626 --> 0:27:44,96
- Thank God!


561
0:27:44,96 --> 0:27:50,533
- Worth every penny.


562
0:27:50,533 --> 0:27:53,2
- We should hug.


563
0:27:53,2 --> 0:27:54,436
- What?


564
0:27:54,436 --> 0:27:56,305
- I mean, we could keep talking,


565
0:27:56,305 --> 0:28:1,31
but I think it would be better if we hugged.


566
0:28:1,31 --> 0:28:3,512
Come on.


567
0:28:3,512 --> 0:28:7,816
- Okay.


568
0:28:7,816 --> 0:28:9,385
Who slam'!
- I do.


569
0:28:9,385 --> 0:28:23,732
- Okay.
- Here we go.


570
0:28:23,732 --> 0:28:25,768
God, so you were here a long time ago.


571
0:28:25,768 --> 0:28:27,336
- Whoa, okay.


572
0:28:27,336 --> 0:28:33,742
- I mean-
- Enough, enough.


573
0:28:33,742 --> 0:28:36,78
That's-l mean, l just mean
because I thought,


574
0:28:36,78 --> 0:28:38,18
with the greenhouses?


575
0:28:38,18 --> 0:28:42,418
- Hey, before you go, I thought
you might like these,


576
0:28:42,418 --> 0:28:44,865
'cause I don't really need 'em
anymore and, uh, here.


577
0:28:44,865 --> 0:28:50,92
Ooh.
Look at this one.


578
0:28:50,92 --> 0:28:51,961
Huh?
No?


579
0:28:51,961 --> 0:28:53,329
- Nah.


580
0:28:53,329 --> 0:28:54,763
- Oh, please, that's a great shirt


581
0:28:54,763 --> 0:28:56,699
You know the trouble I unused in this shirt'!


582
0:28:56,699 --> 0:28:57,906
- I can only imagine,


583
0:28:57,906 --> 0:29:0,102
- You gut no taste on top of everything else.


584
0:29:0,102 --> 0:29:1,972
Oh, my God, what a beautiful shirt


585
0:29:1,972 --> 0:29:3,61
Not giving it to you anyway.
- All right


586
0:29:3,61 --> 0:29:9,345
- Oh, it feels great!


587
0:29:9,345 --> 0:29:10,946
Hello?


588
0:29:10,946 --> 0:29:13,249
Oh, hi.


589
0:29:13,249 --> 0:29:16,785
No, no, he's-he's still here,


590
0:29:16,785 --> 0:29:21,123
Yeah, hold on.


591
0:29:21,123 --> 0:29:24,393
Zibby.


592
0:29:24,393 --> 0:29:25,427
- Hello?


593
0:29:25,427 --> 0:29:26,6
- You haven'! left yet.


594
0:29:26,6 --> 0:29:27,963
- Uh, no.
- Good.


595
0:29:27,963 --> 0:29:30,466
I need to see you before you go.


596
0:29:30,466 --> 0:29:34,47
Will you meet me at the bookstore?


597
0:29:34,47 --> 0:29:35,571
Say yes'


598
0:29:35,571 --> 0:29:38,14
- Yea.


599
0:29:38,14 --> 0:29:40,409
ORGY


600
0:29:40,409 --> 0:29:42,151
asking about a book I recommended.


601
0:29:42,151 --> 0:29:43,178
- Hmm.


602
0:29:43,178 --> 0:29:44,385
- All right, I'm off.
- Okay.


603
0:29:44,385 --> 0:29:45,792
- Be a gentleman.
Walk me to my car.


604
0:29:45,792 --> 0:29:47,149
- All right, all right.


605
0:29:47,149 --> 0:29:49,323
- Thanks for the shirts.
I'll gel them next time, okay?


606
0:29:49,323 --> 0:29:51,39
- Yeah, you'll be an the road,
and you'll be saying,


607
0:29:51,39 --> 0:29:59,962
"Oh, maybe I'll call him up.?


608
0:29:59,962 --> 0:30:1,597
- Hey.
- Hey.


609
0:30:1,597 --> 0:30:3,509
- Sorry, I don't want
to hold you up or anything,


610
0:30:3,509 --> 0:30:5,634
but I, um-


611
0:30:5,634 --> 0:30:6,935
I made this for you.


612
0:30:6,935 --> 0:30:9,104
Burned it, whatever,


613
0:30:9,104 --> 0:30:11,34
Um, ifs music from the survey class


614
0:30:11,34 --> 0:30:12,513
I was telling you about.


615
0:30:12,513 --> 0:30:15,1
- Oh.
- Classical, baroque, opera.


616
0:30:15,1 --> 0:30:17,46
- WWI.


617
0:30:17,46 --> 0:30:18,48
This is great.


618
0:30:18,48 --> 0:30:20,215
I know none of this.


619
0:30:20,215 --> 0:30:22,418
Who says we always have to be listening


620
0:30:22,418 --> 0:30:23,83
to obscure indie bands, right'?


621
0:30:23,83 --> 0:30:25,354
- Right.


622
0:30:25,354 --> 0:30:27,589
So, um, yeah, I don't know.


623
0:30:27,589 --> 0:30:31,694
This is all music I never
thought I'd like or care about,


624
0:30:31,694 --> 0:30:33,696
and this class just-


625
0:30:33,696 --> 0:30:36,177
well, you know how you can be
told something so many limes


626
0:30:36,177 --> 0:30:38,133
and it's like, 'Whatever,"


627
0:30:38,133 --> 0:30:39,702
and then you have a great teacher


628
0:30:39,702 --> 0:30:40,977
take you through it,


629
0:30:40,977 --> 0:30:46,8
and suddenly it's like,
"Beethoven, whoa."


630
0:30:46,8 --> 0:30:47,976
- Yeah.


631
0:30:47,976 --> 0:30:49,478
Thin is really great Thank you.


632
0:30:49,478 --> 0:30:53,148
I wish I had come with something for you.


633
0:30:53,148 --> 0:30:56,518
- Well, you know what you could do?


634
0:30:56,518 --> 0:31:0,456
You could write me a letter.


635
0:31:0,456 --> 0:31:1,561
- I could do that.


636
0:31:1,561 --> 0:31:2,891
- Handwritten, I mean,


637
0:31:2,891 --> 0:31:4,269
like with a pen or something.


638
0:31:4,269 --> 0:31:6,829
- Ooh.
- Yeah, paper.


639
0:31:6,829 --> 0:31:9,64
Maybe seal it with some red wax.


640
0:31:9,64 --> 0:31:10,84
- I could listen to this while I'm writing.


641
0:31:10,84 --> 0:31:13,469
- Right, it'll be like
full-on 17th century.


642
0:31:13,469 --> 0:31:15,671
- Right, right.


643
0:31:15,671 --> 0:31:18,107
So, um, I don't have your address.


644
0:31:18,107 --> 0:31:19,708
- Oh, 108 it my P.O. box.


645
0:31:19,708 --> 0:31:21,245
And you can figure out the rest, right?


646
0:31:21,245 --> 0:31:22,689
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.


647
0:31:22,689 --> 0:31:27,182
- I also-l put my number
on the inside of the case.


648
0:31:27,182 --> 0:31:28,951
- Yes, you did.


649
0:31:28,951 --> 0:31:30,586
- You know, in can you ever-


650
0:31:30,586 --> 0:31:31,687
whatever.


651
0:31:31,687 --> 0:31:34,49
- Yeah, right.


652
0:31:34,49 --> 0:31:35,657
Okay-


653
0:31:35,657 --> 0:31:39,294
- Well...
- Well...


654
0:31:39,294 --> 0:31:40,429
- Yeah.


655
0:31:40,429 --> 0:31:51,44
Bye.
- Bye.


656
0:31:51,44 --> 0:31:54,109
- Professor Fairfield.


657
0:31:54,109 --> 0:31:57,45
Uh, Jesse Fisher.


658
0:31:57,45 --> 0:31:59,47
I, um-


659
0:31:59,47 --> 0:32:1,116
I took your British Romantic literature class


660
0:32:1,116 --> 0:32:4,42
when I was here as a student.


661
0:32:4,42 --> 0:32:7,289
. And?


662
0:32:7,289 --> 0:32:19,1
- And I loved it.


663
0:32:19,1 --> 0:32:30,712
Great.


664
0:32:30,712 --> 0:32:35,284
Hey, Dean.


665
0:32:35,284 --> 0:32:36,985
- I know ifs bad for you.


666
0:32:36,985 --> 0:32:40,355
- Just quit when you graduate,
like everyone else.


667
0:32:40,355 --> 0:32:42,24
- Sweet ride.


668
0:32:42,24 --> 0:32:43,492
- You jerk


669
0:32:43,492 --> 0:32:45,16
It's a rental.


670
0:32:45,16 --> 0:32:48,497
I'm not the best at flying.


671
0:32:48,497 --> 0:32:49,738
- I can understand that


672
0:32:49,738 --> 0:32:50,767
- Where you headed?


673
0:32:50,767 --> 0:32:51,973
- Back to my dorm.


674
0:32:51,973 --> 0:33:5,147
- Get in.
I'll give you a lift.


675
0:33:5,147 --> 0:33:6,949
- So you went here, right'?


676
0:33:6,949 --> 0:33:8,16
- I did.


677
0:33:8,16 --> 0:33:9,52
- You liked it'?


678
0:33:9,52 --> 0:33:10,686
- Am.


679
0:33:10,686 --> 0:33:12,855
I mean, you block out
the bad memories-


680
0:33:12,855 --> 0:33:15,824
writing a senior thesis, February.


681
0:33:15,824 --> 0:33:17,593
- Yeah, February here sucks.


682
0:33:17,593 --> 0:33:19,228
- Yeah, it's horrible.


683
0:33:19,228 --> 0:33:24,32
So other than February,
things are good for you here?


684
0:33:24,32 --> 0:33:27,302
- I wouldn't say that.


685
0:33:27,302 --> 0:33:34,142
- You want to-you can tell me
about it if you want.


686
0:33:34,142 --> 0:33:37,546
Well, um, ifs nut exactly a secret.


687
0:33:37,546 --> 0:33:44,52
Last year, I kind of, um lost my mind a bit.


688
0:33:44,52 --> 0:33:45,555
I don'! really remember
much of it,


689
0:33:45,555 --> 0:33:50,359
but apparently I got up to
some pretty amusing antics.


690
0:33:50,359 --> 0:33:55,23
So now they've got me
on this pretty heavy stuff,


691
0:33:55,23 --> 0:33:58,233
which I guess allows me to function


692
0:33:58,233 --> 0:34:1,737
but it also makes everything seem underwater,


693
0:34:1,737 --> 0:34:4,806
which is not an pleasant as it sounds.


694
0:34:4,806 --> 0:34:7,509
- Why'd you come back?


695
0:34:7,509 --> 0:34:10,812
a nurse.


696
0:34:10,812 --> 0:34:12,981
She raised me on her own.


697
0:34:12,981 --> 0:34:15,417
I got a full ride.


698
0:34:15,417 --> 0:34:18,987
She's...


699
0:34:18,987 --> 0:34:27,429
so proud I'm here.


700
0:34:27,429 --> 0:35:43,5
Thanks for the lift.


701
0:35:43,5 --> 0:35:45,841
- 'Dear Zibby, I can't thank you enough

isn't being written today.

were expressing things musically

our current psychic state...'

819
0:43:44,219 --> 0:43:46,588
- So, Bob, um,


820
0:43:46,588 --> 0:43:50,658
I've been asking myself
a lot of tough questions lately.


821
0:43:50,658 --> 0:43:52,76
Everybody knows I made a whole stink


822
0:43:52,76 --> 0:43:54,968
about leaving this place,
you know, how it's time-


823
0:43:54,968 --> 0:43:56,34
- How if you'd look back,


824
0:43:56,34 --> 0:43:58,433
you'd tum into a pillar of salt


825
0:43:58,433 --> 0:44:2,971
- Yeah, all that-


826
0:44:2,971 --> 0:44:9,1
- I think I may have spoken too soon.


827
0:44:9,1 --> 0:44:12,28
I think-l think I still got
a little gas in the tank is all.


828
0:44:12,28 --> 0:44:13,681
I just-


829
0:44:13,681 --> 0:44:16,417
- Well, Peter, you have no
bigger fan around here than me.


830
0:44:16,417 --> 0:44:18,786
- Thank you.


831
0:44:18,786 --> 0:44:22,19
- When you announced your plans,
we were all sad to see you go,


832
0:44:22,19 --> 0:44:23,693
but you insisted that it was time.


833
0:44:23,693 --> 0:44:26,294
- Right, which I thought it was.


834
0:44:26,294 --> 0:44:29,364
- We hired someone,


835
0:44:29,364 --> 0:44:31,666
young guy out of UVA.


836
0:44:31,666 --> 0:44:34,68
Very impressive candidate.


837
0:44:34,68 --> 0:44:36,371
He was our first choice, actually.


838
0:44:36,371 --> 0:44:39,374
We didn't think we would get him, but we did.


839
0:44:39,374 --> 0:44:42,877
You said you wanted
nothing to do with the search.


840
0:44:42,877 --> 0:44:45,446
- Right, right
No, I-


841
0:44:45,446 --> 0:44:48,55
I just-


842
0:44:48,55 --> 0:44:50,685
I just didn't think it would move so fast.


843
0:44:50,685 --> 0:44:54,656
- Well, there was unanimous
enthusiasm for the candidate,


844
0:44:54,656 --> 0:45:0,295
so things just moved along faster than normal.


845
0:45:0,295 --> 0:45:2,397
- Bob.


846
0:45:2,397 --> 0:45:3,536
Give me this one,


847
0:45:3,536 --> 0:45:7,502
- Polar, we can't.


848
0:45:7,502 --> 0:45:9,47
The department has spent thousands of dollars


849
0:45:9,47 --> 0:45:10,575
on this search.


850
0:45:10,575 --> 0:45:12,34
He's turned down other offers.


851
0:45:12,34 --> 0:45:14,252
You know what goes into this sort of thing.


852
0:45:14,252 --> 0:45:17,312
- I hired you, Bob.


853
0:45:17,312 --> 0:45:21,382
You don't have to tell me
how this w-


854
0:45:21,382 --> 0:45:23,117
And let me tell you,


855
0:45:23,117 --> 0:45:27,422
there was not unanimous
enthusiasm for you back then.


856
0:45:27,422 --> 0:45:29,96
It took a lat of arm-Misting
on my part


857
0:45:29,96 --> 0:45:31,526
to gel people to come around.


858
0:45:31,526 --> 0:45:35,763
And now, 20 years later, the only reason


859
0:45:35,763 --> 0:45:37,937
that you're the chairman
of this goddamn department


860
0:45:37,937 --> 0:45:39,601
is 'cause I loathe politics!


861
0:45:39,601 --> 0:45:45,506
And you, for reasons
which I cannot fathom, do not


862
0:45:45,506 --> 0:45:55,45
In fact, you seem to have a real taste for it.


863
0:45:55,45 --> 0:46:1,689
Wow'


864
0:46:1,689 --> 0:46:7,629
I'm asking-


865
0:46:7,629 --> 0:46:9,397
I'm asking a favor.


866
0:46:9,397 --> 0:46:10,632
Listen'


867
0:46:10,632 --> 0:46:13,835
Just give me this one, Bob, okay?


868
0:46:13,835 --> 0:46:19,14
I need three more years.


869
0:46:19,14 --> 0:46:21,809
- I'm luff!-


870
0:46:21,809 --> 0:46:36,457
There's nothing I can do.


871
0:46:36,457 --> 0:46:37,492
- Hey-


872
0:46:37,492 --> 0:46:39,794
- Hi.


873
0:46:39,794 --> 0:46:40,995
- Oh, hey.


874
0:46:40,995 --> 0:46:42,6
- Jesse, you remember Vanessa, right?


875
0:46:42,6 --> 0:46:45,333
- Uh, yeah, hi.
- You're back'


876
0:46:45,333 --> 0:46:49,57
- Yeah.


877
0:46:49,57 --> 0:46:51,606
- So I should-


878
0:46:51,606 --> 0:47:0,848
uh, yeah, I got some stuff to do.


879
0:47:0,848 --> 0:47:2,95
- So this is your room.


880
0:47:2,95 --> 0:47:4,55
- Yeah.
Fancy, huh?


881
0:47:4,55 --> 0:47:5,186
- Yeah.


882
0:47:5,186 --> 0:47:7,155
Forgot how small these are.


883
0:47:7,155 --> 0:47:10,858
Good training for living in New York


884
0:47:10,858 --> 0:47:12,894
- So are you gonna see Professor Hoberg


885
0:47:12,894 --> 0:47:14,696
while you're here?


886
0:47:14,696 --> 0:47:16,364
- You know, probably not


887
0:47:16,364 --> 0:47:17,799
Um...


888
0:47:17,799 --> 0:47:20,468
and, you know, if you-
if you run into him,


889
0:47:20,468 --> 0:47:22,21
maybe don't mention that I'm here.


890
0:47:22,21 --> 0:47:26,4
. ORGY-
- OK!!-


891
0:47:26,4 --> 0:47:29,477
- Do you want to sit?


892
0:47:29,477 --> 0:47:38,786
- Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.


893
0:47:38,786 --> 0:47:40,221
So I should tell you,


894
0:47:40,221 --> 0:47:42,557
I feel a little weird about being here.


895
0:47:42,557 --> 0:47:43,991
- Why?
Don't.


896
0:47:43,991 --> 0:47:45,903
- Well, I don't know if you know this,


897
0:47:45,903 --> 0:47:49,63
but, uh, I'm a few years older than you.


898
0:47:49,63 --> 0:47:50,531
- You are?


899
0:47:50,531 --> 0:47:52,66
- Just a few, yeah,


900
0:47:52,66 --> 0:47:53,801
and I'm not necessarily
saying-


901
0:47:53,801 --> 0:47:55,406
I don't want to get ahead of myself here.


902
0:47:55,406 --> 0:47:56,537
Ifs just-


903
0:47:56,537 --> 0:47:57,872
- Oh, Wail. 30"'!-


904
0:47:57,872 --> 0:48:5,246
You-did you think this was,
like, a romantic thing?


905
0:48:5,246 --> 0:48:7,915
Just kidding.


906
0:48:7,915 --> 0:48:9,283
- Oh, my--


907
0:48:9,283 --> 0:48:18,426
- Come here.


908
0:48:18,426 --> 0:48:21,829
Try not to overthink things, okay?


909
0:48:21,829 --> 0:48:23,275
- You're talking to the wrong guy.


910
0:48:23,275 --> 0:48:26,567
- Well, look


911
0:48:26,567 --> 0:48:28,603
We connect really well,
don! you think?


912
0:48:28,603 --> 0:48:31,406
- We do, yeah.


913
0:48:31,406 --> 0:48:33,751
I just can't figure out
if ifs because you're advanced


914
0:48:33,751 --> 0:48:35,843
or because I'm stunted,


915
0:48:35,843 --> 0:48:38,312
- It's because I'm advanced.


916
0:48:38,312 --> 0:48:40,114
. Maybe.


917
0:48:40,114 --> 0:48:45,953
But I'm also a little stunted.


918
0:48:45,953 --> 0:48:48,856
- Look, I want lo like things slowly, okay?


919
0:48:48,856 --> 0:48:50,591
- Yeah, okay.


920
0:48:50,591 --> 0:48:53,127
Me too.
Me too.


921
0:48:53,127 --> 0:48:55,797
- But I would like to kiss you


922
0:48:55,797 --> 0:48:59,3
on your forehead.


923
0:48:59,3 --> 0:49:2,437
Can I kiss you on your forehead?


924
0:49:2,437 --> 0:49:3,538
Say yes'


925
0:49:3,538 --> 0:49:12,413
- Yea.


926
0:49:12,413 --> 0:49:14,248
- And your chin'!


927
0:49:14,248 --> 0:49:34,1
May I kiss your chin?


928
0:49:34,1 --> 0:49:35,14
- Sorry.
Hi, sorry.


929
0:49:35,14 --> 0:49:44,11
Just need to grab something.


930
0:49:44,11 --> 0:49:45,913
- Roommates.


931
0:49:45,913 --> 0:49:48,749
- Can we-are you hungry'!


932
0:49:48,749 --> 0:49:50,17
- I could eat.


933
0:49:50,17 --> 0:49:51,352
- Yeah?


934
0:49:51,352 --> 0:49:53,988
Maybe we could go into town and grab something?


935
0:49:53,988 --> 0:49:55,59
- That'll take too long.


936
0:49:55,59 --> 0:49:57,225
I have class at 2:00.


937
0:49:57,225 --> 0:49:58,593
- On.


938
0:49:58,593 --> 0:50:34,795
good and even closer.


939
0:50:34,795 --> 0:50:39,333
- Hey, Dean.


940
0:50:39,333 --> 0:50:41,202
- You get a job here?


941
0:50:41,202 --> 0:50:42,27
- I wish.


942
0:50:42,27 --> 0:50:44,272
Hey, I seem to have lost my friend.


943
0:50:44,272 --> 0:50:50,11
You mind if I...


944
0:50:50,11 --> 0:50:52,113
What are you working on?


945
0:50:52,113 --> 0:50:56,5
- Yeah, ifs this...


946
0:50:56,5 --> 0:50:57,752
novel.


947
0:50:57,752 --> 0:50:59,86
- Good for you.


948
0:50:59,86 --> 0:51:0,187
- I fill!!!


949
0:51:0,187 --> 0:51:1,258
- You happy with if?


950
0:51:1,258 --> 0:51:6,427
- Not really.


951
0:51:6,427 --> 0:51:7,771
- Haw you been?
Any batter?


952
0:51:7,771 --> 0:51:10,264
- No.


953
0:51:10,264 --> 0:51:12,6
I kind of just wish this would all be over


954
0:51:12,6 --> 0:51:17,238
as soon as possible.


955
0:51:17,238 --> 0:51:24,612
Why did you lave it here so much'!


956
0:51:24,612 --> 0:51:28,149
- It's the only time you get
to do this, you know?


957
0:51:28,149 --> 0:51:30,451
You get to sit around and read books all day,


958
0:51:30,451 --> 0:51:33,621
have really great conversations about idea;


959
0:51:33,621 --> 0:51:37,892
People out in the world,
they're not really doing that.


960
0:51:37,892 --> 0:51:39,26
Think about it.


961
0:51:39,26 --> 0:51:41,434
You could go up to everyone here
and say, 'I'm a poet,"


962
0:51:41,434 --> 0:51:44,332
and no one will punch you in the face.


963
0:51:44,332 --> 0:51:46,801
I mean, that's something.


964
0:51:46,801 --> 0:51:48,402
- Yeah.


965
0:51:48,402 --> 0:51:51,806
I get that.


966
0:51:51,806 --> 0:51:54,241
I just can't get around the fact


967
0:51:54,241 --> 0:51:58,412
that I'm, like, aggressively unhappy here.


968
0:51:58,412 --> 0:52:0,47
- Jesse.


969
0:52:0,47 --> 0:52:10,891
Jesse!


970
0:52:10,891 --> 0:52:38,552
- That's my number, if you ever want to talk,


971
0:52:38,552 --> 0:52:42,323
. HEY-
. HO)'-


972
0:52:42,323 --> 0:52:44,325
- Please tell me this is Vanessa's.


973
0:52:44,325 --> 0:52:46,46
- Nope, that's mine.


974
0:52:46,46 --> 0:52:47,701
- Wait, you actually read this'?


975
0:52:47,701 --> 0:52:48,829
- Yeah.


976
0:52:48,829 --> 0:52:50,131
- All of it?


977
0:52:50,131 --> 0:52:51,365
- YUP-


978
0:52:51,365 --> 0:52:54,101
- Unironically?


979
0:52:54,101 --> 0:52:57,204
- Very sincerely'


980
0:52:57,204 --> 0:53:1,375
- What is it with you girls and vampires?


981
0:53:1,375 --> 0:53:2,877
What's it about'?


982
0:53:2,877 --> 0:53:4,178
- Vampires.


983
0:53:4,178 --> 0:53:6,881
- No, what's it about?


984
0:53:6,881 --> 0:53:8,49
Vampires.


985
0:53:8,49 --> 0:53:10,51
- I don't understand.
Is it good?


986
0:53:10,51 --> 0:53:11,118
- No.


987
0:53:11,118 --> 0:53:13,387
I mean, yeah.
But no.


988
0:53:13,387 --> 0:53:14,389
- Well, then why read it'?


989
0:53:14,389 --> 0:53:15,723
- 'Cause I like it.


990
0:53:15,723 --> 0:53:18,359
- That's no reason to read something.


991
0:53:18,359 --> 0:53:20,695
- Why else would you read something?


992
0:53:20,695 --> 0:53:21,862
- Seriously.


993
0:53:21,862 --> 0:53:24,198
Many amazing books in the world.


994
0:53:24,198 --> 0:53:25,599
Why would you read this?


995
0:53:25,599 --> 0:53:28,69
- Okay, I hate this conversation.


996
0:53:28,69 --> 0:53:29,57
Can we stop?


997
0:53:29,57 --> 0:53:30,914
- Wait, this is a trilogy, right?


998
0:53:30,914 --> 0:53:33,674
- I'm afraid to answer that.


999
0:53:33,674 --> 0:53:35,509
- You've read three of these?


1000
0:53:35,509 --> 0:53:36,818
- Have you ever read one of them?


1001
0:53:36,818 --> 0:53:38,212
What do you think?


1002
0:53:38,212 --> 0:53:41,148
- How can you hate something
if you've never read it?


1003
0:53:41,148 --> 0:53:44,685
I mean, isn't that like
what repressive regimes do?


1004
0:53:44,685 --> 0:53:46,754
You want to bum books you don't like?


1005
0:53:46,754 --> 0:53:49,19
- You're right.
You know what l'm gonna do?


1006
0:53:49,19 --> 0:53:51,102
Rm gonna read thin book, all of it


1007
0:53:51,102 --> 0:53:53,16
And then we can discuss it.


1008
0:53:53,16 --> 0:53:55,229
- Right now?
- Yeah, why not')


1009
0:53:55,229 --> 0:53:57,231
I mean, how long can it take, really?


1010
0:53:57,231 --> 0:54:2,203
This is great, a little book club.


1011
0:54:2,203 --> 0:54:3,704
- Seriously?


1012
0:54:3,704 --> 0:54:5,539
- YUP-


1013
0:54:5,539 --> 0:54:42,943
See ya soon.


1014
0:54:42,943 --> 0:54:45,78
Oh, no, this isn't what it-


1015
0:54:45,78 --> 0:54:47,648
I'm reading it as a dare.


1016
0:54:47,648 --> 0:54:52,82
It's a bet, actually.


1017
0:54:52,82 --> 0:55:25,82
I loved your class!


1018
0:55:25,82 --> 0:55:27,188
- Should I start'?


1019
0:55:27,188 --> 0:55:29,23
- Please.


1020
0:55:29,23 --> 0:55:31,125
- OK!!-


1021
0:55:31,125 --> 0:55:33,494
I liked it.


1022
0:55:33,494 --> 0:55:35,863
It was fun and stupid.
- Mm-hmm


1023
0:55:35,863 --> 0:55:37,498
- And it passed the time.


1024
0:55:37,498 --> 0:55:40,835
And it's not Tolstoy,
but it's also not television.


1025
0:55:40,835 --> 0:55:43,971
And it made me happy.


1026
0:55:43,971 --> 0:55:47,541
Now you.


1027
0:55:47,541 --> 0:55:52,112
- Thank you.
- Mm.


1028
0:55:52,112 --> 0:55:54,181
- This...


1029
0:55:54,181 --> 0:55:56,383
is the worst book


1030
0:55:56,383 --> 0:55:59,153
ever written


1031
0:55:59,153 --> 0:56:1,422
in English.


1032
0:56:1,422 --> 0:56:5,993
- So there are worse books
written in other languages?


1033
0:56:5,993 --> 0:56:7,661
- Probably not


1034
0:56:7,661 --> 0:56:10,231
unless this book is translated
into other languages.


1035
0:56:10,231 --> 0:56:11,899
- Okay, we really-


1036
0:56:11,899 --> 0:56:13,38
we don't need to do this.


1037
0:56:13,38 --> 0:56:14,602
- No, please, let's.


1038
0:56:14,602 --> 0:56:17,771
I need to know
haw you read these-


1039
0:56:17,771 --> 0:56:20,441
whew, l guess
you call them sentences-


1040
0:56:20,441 --> 0:56:22,743
close the book, and feel anything


1041
0:56:22,743 --> 0:56:23,882
other than offended and sad?


1042
0:56:23,882 --> 0:56:25,256
- Well, millions of people like it.


1043
0:56:25,256 --> 0:56:27,56
- So when millions of people like something,


1044
0:56:27,56 --> 0:56:28,22
that means it's good?


1045
0:56:28,22 --> 0:56:29,854
- No, it means millions of people like it


1046
0:56:29,854 --> 0:56:33,153
These books make people happy.


1047
0:56:33,153 --> 0:56:35,464
We don't always have to be
thinking about poli-sci


1048
0:56:35,464 --> 0:56:37,758
or reading Chaucer, which, by the way, I hated.


1049
0:56:37,758 --> 0:56:39,627
- You're not supposed to like it.


1050
0:56:39,627 --> 0:56:42,363
- But then why read if?


1051
0:56:42,363 --> 0:56:43,764
You love college so much, right?


1052
0:56:43,764 --> 0:56:46,2
Isn't it all about understanding
different points of view'?


1053
0:56:46,2 --> 0:56:47,942
- It's also about developing taste.


1054
0:56:47,942 --> 0:56:49,77
- That was snobby.
You're a snob.


1055
0:56:49,77 --> 0:56:50,938
- No, I'm not


1056
0:56:50,938 --> 0:56:52,111
- Yea, you are.


1057
0:56:52,111 --> 0:56:53,609
You think it's cool to hale things.


1058
0:56:53,609 --> 0:56:55,442
And it's not.
It's boring.


1059
0:56:55,442 --> 0:56:56,717
Talk about what you love,


1060
0:56:56,717 --> 0:56:58,622
and keep quiet about what you don't


1061
0:56:58,622 --> 0:57:0,748
- Look, I know how this sounds, but trust me.


1062
0:57:0,748 --> 0:57:2,449
This is a big deal, okay'?


1063
0:57:2,449 --> 0:57:3,929
This country is in bad shape,


1064
0:57:3,929 --> 0:57:6,487
and it has to do, in large part, I think,


1065
0:57:6,487 --> 0:57:9,556
with people liking things
that are very, very bad.


1066
0:57:9,556 --> 0:57:11,392
- But according to you,


1067
0:57:11,392 --> 0:57:13,771
Why are you the one who gets
to decide what's good and bad?


1068
0:57:13,771 --> 0:57:15,469
And do you only want to surround yourself


1069
0:57:15,469 --> 0:57:17,409
with people who've read the same books as you?


1070
0:57:17,409 --> 0:57:23,37
- I guess we're gonna have to
move on to a specific example-


1071
0:57:23,37 --> 0:57:24,838
- Where are you?


1072
0:57:24,838 --> 0:57:26,14
- What do you mean?


1073
0:57:26,14 --> 0:57:28,142
- I mean, you are somewhere,


1074
0:57:28,142 --> 0:57:29,476
but it's not here.


1075
0:57:29,476 --> 0:57:32,212
- No, I'm-l'm here.


1076
0:57:32,212 --> 0:57:34,481
- So why are we spending all our time


1077
0:57:34,481 --> 0:57:49,964
having a stupid argument about a book?


1078
0:57:49,964 --> 0:57:50,998
- Hey, Peter.


1079
0:57:50,998 --> 0:58:5,12
- Zibby


1080
0:58:5,12 --> 0:58:6,547
- Peter.


1081
0:58:6,547 --> 0:58:9,183
Peter.


1082
0:58:9,183 --> 0:58:13,32
- What the hell are you doing here?


1083
0:58:13,32 --> 0:58:20,894
I don't know'


1084
0:58:20,894 --> 0:58:23,664
- You know how old I am?


1085
0:58:23,664 --> 0:58:24,999
- No, how old are you?


1086
0:58:24,999 --> 0:58:27,34
none of your goddamn business.


1087
0:58:27,34 --> 0:58:31,171
Do you know how old I feel like I am?


1088
0:58:31,171 --> 0:58:33,874
19.


1089
0:58:33,874 --> 0:58:38,212
Since I was 19, I have never felt not 19.


1090
0:58:38,212 --> 0:58:42,49
But I shave my face, and I look in the mirror,


1091
0:58:42,49 --> 0:58:43,384
and I'm forced to say,


1092
0:58:43,384 --> 0:58:48,989
"This is not a 19-year-old
staring back at me, ?


1093
0:58:48,989 --> 0:58:51,925
Teaching here all these years,


1094
0:58:51,925 --> 0:58:55,229
I've had to be very clear with myself


1095
0:58:55,229 --> 0:58:57,531
that even though I'm surrounded
by 19-year-old:


1096
0:58:57,531 --> 0:59:0,67
and I may have felt 19,


1097
0:59:0,67 --> 0:59:2,369
I'm not 19 anymore.


1098
0:59:2,369 --> 0:59:6,14
You follow me?


1099
0:59:6,14 --> 0:59:9,9
- Yeah.


1100
0:59:9,9 --> 0:59:13,147
- Nobody feels like an adult.


1101
0:59:13,147 --> 0:59:27,428
It's the world's dirty secret.


1102
0:59:27,428 --> 0:59:30,931
- How perfect is the universe?


1103
0:59:30,931 --> 0:59:33,367
- You're still here?


1104
0:59:33,367 --> 0:59:35,202
- Lucky for you,


1105
0:59:35,202 --> 0:59:43,444
'cause you look like you could use a friend.


1106
0:59:43,444 --> 0:59:46,18
Did you know there's so many
preservatives in the food we eat


1107
0:59:46,18 --> 0:59:47,888
that they're finding it's taking longer


1108
0:59:47,888 --> 0:59:51,985
for our bodies to decompose once we die?


1109
0:59:51,985 --> 0:59:53,287
- No way.
Really?


1110
0:59:53,287 --> 0:59:59,827
- Preservatives, man.
messed up.


1111
0:59:59,827 --> 1:0:1,295
Want some good news?


1112
1:0:1,295 --> 1:0:3,797
- Please.


1113
1:0:3,797 --> 1:0:6,934
- Caterpillars-
give me my hat.


1114
1:0:6,934 --> 1:0:9,736
They're just scouting along, right,


1115
1:0:9,736 --> 1:0:11,672
being caterpillars.


1116
1:0:11,672 --> 1:0:14,775
At some point, these cells
show up called imaginal cells.


1117
1:0:14,775 --> 1:0:16,483
Scientists don't know where they come from


1118
1:0:16,483 --> 1:0:17,811
or why they appear,


1119
1:0:17,811 --> 1:0:21,215
but these imaginal cells show up
inside the caterpillar


1120
1:0:21,215 --> 1:0:23,162
and say, 'Get psyched, caterpillar!


1121
1:0:23,162 --> 1:0:25,652
It's butterfly-turning-into
time."


1122
1:0:25,652 --> 1:0:26,987
- Mm-hmm.


1123
1:0:26,987 --> 1:0:28,968
- And whit do all the other caterpillar calla do


1124
1:0:28,968 --> 1:0:30,958
when these imaginal cells show up?


1125
1:0:30,958 --> 1:0:32,559
- I have no idea.


1126
1:0:32,559 --> 1:0:33,664
- They attack 'em!


1127
1:0:33,664 --> 1:0:35,329
Try to kill 'em!


1128
1:0:35,329 --> 1:0:38,332
They're like, 'Screw you, imaginal cells.


1129
1:0:38,332 --> 1:0:40,134
'We're happy being a caterpillar.


1130
1:0:40,134 --> 1:0:41,869
Gel lost!?


1131
1:0:41,869 --> 1:0:45,973
Bu! eventually,
the imaginal cells keep growling


1132
1:0:45,973 --> 1:0:48,842
and overtake the destiny of the caterpillar


1133
1:0:48,842 --> 1:0:51,178
and will it into this cocoon.


1134
1:0:51,178 --> 1:0:53,46
And then guess what happens next.


1135
1:0:53,46 --> 1:0:56,16
into a butterfly.


1136
1:0:56,16 --> 1:0:59,19
- The caterpillar turns into a butterfly.


1137
1:0:59,19 --> 1:1:0,192
- That's awesome.


1138
1:1:0,192 --> 1:1:1,522
- I know it is!


1139
1:1:1,522 --> 1:1:3,257
- Yeah, that's good.


1140
1:1:3,257 --> 1:1:7,728
- And that is why there is
no reason to be afraid,


1141
1:1:7,728 --> 1:1:11,732
because everything is okay.


1142
1:1:11,732 --> 1:1:15,669
- Yeah, I don't know if I believe that.


1143
1:1:15,669 --> 1:1:19,973
- It has to be true.


1144
1:1:19,973 --> 1:1:26,48
There can be no other way.


1145
1:1:26,48 --> 1:1:29,16
- You know, I'm not even sure if you're real.


1146
1:1:29,16 --> 1:1:30,817
I mean, seriously.


1147
1:1:30,817 --> 1:1:33,82
- Ifs all true, brother.


1148
1:1:33,82 --> 1:1:37,324
Whatever you believe.


1149
1:1:37,324 --> 1:1:38,565
- What is that?


1150
1:1:38,565 --> 1:1:39,63
What are you drinking?


1151
1:1:39,63 --> 1:1:42,95
- H to the 2 to the O.


1152
1:1:42,95 --> 1:1:43,664
You should have some.


1153
1:1:43,664 --> 1:1:47,534
Got to stay hydrated.


1154
1:1:47,534 --> 1:1:57,177
- All right.


1155
1:1:57,177 --> 1:2:12,192
Oh, thanks.


1156
1:2:12,192 --> 1:2:17,13
Ooh!


1157
1:2:17,13 --> 1:2:21,34
You with me, bro?


1158
1:2:21,34 --> 1:2:24,504
Yeah.


1159
1:2:24,504 --> 1:2:28,575
I like you, Nat'


1160
1:2:28,575 --> 1:2:31,812
Thanks for being my friend.


1161
1:2:31,812 --> 1:2:34,114
- Easiest thing in the world.


1162
1:2:34,114 --> 1:2:37,451
- I enjoyed this.


1163
1:2:37,451 --> 1:2:42,556
I'm off.


1164
1:2:42,556 --> 1:2:45,726
- You go get her, man.


1165
1:2:45,726 --> 1:2:49,396
- Huh


1166
1:2:49,396 --> 1:2:54,1
Okay-


1167
1:2:54,1 --> 1:2:58,138
- Be love, man.


1168
1:2:58,138 --> 1:3:11,285
Be love!


1169
1:3:11,285 --> 1:3:13,2
You seem happy.


1170
1:3:13,2 --> 1:3:15,155
- I am.


1171
1:3:15,155 --> 1:3:17,491
- What happened?


1172
1:3:17,491 --> 1:3:19,593
- I don't know.


1173
1:3:19,593 --> 1:3:21,962
Something.


1174
1:3:21,962 --> 1:3:24,97
- Can I tell you some things?


1175
1:3:24,97 --> 1:3:25,432
- Yeah, yeah, sure.


1176
1:3:25,432 --> 1:3:29,436
- Okay, well, except for the book thing,


1177
1:3:29,436 --> 1:3:33,273
which was genuinely super annoying,


1178
1:3:33,273 --> 1:3:38,845
I-I feel really good about you.


1179
1:3:38,845 --> 1:3:44,685
It's been a while since I fell
that way about someone.


1180
1:3:44,685 --> 1:3:48,322
And I like it.


1181
1:3:48,322 --> 1:3:50,791
- Yeah, me too.


1182
1:3:50,791 --> 1:3:55,796
- I want you lo slay here with me tonight


1183
1:3:55,796 --> 1:3:58,31
- You have a roommate,


1184
1:3:58,31 --> 1:4:3,36
- She's sleeping elsewhere.


1185
1:4:3,36 --> 1:4:4,971
- Ah.


1186
1:4:4,971 --> 1:4:9,176
- So will you stay here?


1187
1:4:9,176 --> 1:4:10,877
- Yea.


1188
1:4:10,877 --> 1:4:13,613
- Good.


1189
1:4:13,613 --> 1:4:15,382
But I have in tell you something.


1190
1:4:15,382 --> 1:4:19,72
Um...


1191
1:4:19,72 --> 1:4:23,724
this-it would be my, um...


1192
1:4:23,724 --> 1:4:29,629
first time.


1193
1:4:29,629 --> 1:4:32,566
But I want to.


1194
1:4:32,566 --> 1:4:37,404
With you.


1195
1:4:37,404 --> 1:4:41,174
- Okay, um...


1196
1:4:41,174 --> 1:4:42,943
I have to-


1197
1:4:42,943 --> 1:4:44,244
hold on.


1198
1:4:44,244 --> 1:4:46,947
I'll-l'll be back
in a second, okay'?


1199
1:4:46,947 --> 1:5:16,743
- OK!!-


1200
1:5:16,743 --> 1:5:18,155
- I should never have told you that


1201
1:5:18,155 --> 1:5:19,746
good.


1202
1:5:19,746 --> 1:5:24,551
I'm-l'm glad you did.


1203
1:5:24,551 --> 1:5:26,92
- So is that a problem?


1204
1:5:26,92 --> 1:5:30,39
- Well, yeah, it is.


1205
1:5:30,39 --> 1:5:33,693
- WM?


1206
1:5:33,693 --> 1:5:36,696
Okay, well, first of all, I'm 35.


1207
1:5:36,696 --> 1:5:38,598
- You don'! look it
- Thank you.


1208
1:5:38,598 --> 1:5:39,805
- Plus, it doesn't bother me.


1209
1:5:39,805 --> 1:5:41,134
- Well, it bothers me.


1210
1:5:41,134 --> 1:5:42,307
- Well, it shouldn't.


1211
1:5:42,307 --> 1:5:45,405
Age is a stupid thing to obsess over.


1212
1:5:45,405 --> 1:5:47,874
What if reincarnation is real, huh?


1213
1:5:47,874 --> 1:5:49,342
Think about that.


1214
1:5:49,342 --> 1:5:52,813
What if I'm, like, thousands
of years older than you?


1215
1:5:52,813 --> 1:5:55,482
- Okay, that's not really a sound argument.


1216
1:5:55,482 --> 1:5:56,817
- Why not')


1217
1:5:56,817 --> 1:5:58,618
- Because ifs like saying,


1218
1:5:58,618 --> 1:6:1,354
'What if reality is all
an illusion?"


1219
1:6:1,354 --> 1:6:3,356
Then there are no consequences to anything.


1220
1:6:3,356 --> 1:6:5,258
We're completely off the hook,


1221
1:6:5,258 --> 1:6:8,361
And I believe in consequences.


1222
1:6:8,361 --> 1:6:10,497
- No, you believe in guilt.


1223
1:6:10,497 --> 1:6:12,833
- Maybe.


1224
1:6:12,833 --> 1:6:23,443
But guilt before we act is called morality.


1225
1:6:23,443 --> 1:6:25,679
Why did you come back here?


1226
1:6:25,679 --> 1:6:28,14
- To see you,
but I didn't know that you-


1227
1:6:28,14 --> 1:6:29,358
- Why should that matter'!


1228
1:6:29,358 --> 1:6:31,952
I mean, inn'! it,
I don't know, flattering?


1229
1:6:31,952 --> 1:6:34,54
- Listen.


1230
1:6:34,54 --> 1:6:37,858
Elizabeth.


1231
1:6:37,858 --> 1:6:41,528
Sex is really complicated, okay?


1232
1:6:41,528 --> 1:6:44,865
I didn't quite understand that
when I was younger,


1233
1:6:44,865 --> 1:6:46,333
but I do now.


1234
1:6:46,333 --> 1:6:48,61
- Okay, look, I didn't sign
one of those contracts


1235
1:6:48,61 --> 1:6:50,47
when I was in high school, okay?


1236
1:6:50,47 --> 1:6:53,306
I'm not a prude or whatever.


1237
1:6:53,306 --> 1:6:57,711
just, I never met anyone that I trusted


1238
1:6:57,711 --> 1:7:2,82
or even liked enough


1239
1:7:2,82 --> 1:7:7,354
until now.


1240
1:7:7,354 --> 1:7:13,26
- I can't.


1241
1:7:13,26 --> 1:7:17,397
- Are you not attracted to me?


1242
1:7:17,397 --> 1:7:19,633
- Na.
I mean, yea, I am.


1243
1:7:19,633 --> 1:7:22,68
It's just.


1244
1:7:22,68 --> 1:7:28,341
I also care about you a lat already, somehow.


1245
1:7:28,341 --> 1:7:31,912
- So, um, essentially,


1246
1:7:31,912 --> 1:7:33,256
you don't want to sleep with me


1247
1:7:33,256 --> 1:7:40,186
because you like and respect me too much.


1248
1:7:40,186 --> 1:7:42,389
- Basically.


1249
1:7:42,389 --> 1:7:44,858
Yeah.


1250
1:7:44,858 --> 1:7:47,26
- That's, like, the saddest thing over.


1251
1:7:47,26 --> 1:7:48,706
- Look, I want to be in your life.


1252
1:7:48,706 --> 1:7:49,896
I do.


1253
1:7:49,896 --> 1:7:52,699
- Yeah, I already have an older brother, okay'?


1254
1:7:52,699 --> 1:7:59,105
And I don't need some mentor.


1255
1:7:59,105 --> 1:8:5,211
- I can'! just say yes
to everything.


1256
1:8:5,211 --> 1:8:7,414
Elizabeth.


1257
1:8:7,414 --> 1:8:9,316
- Slop calling me that.


1258
1:8:9,316 --> 1:8:10,417
- What?


1259
1:8:10,417 --> 1:8:11,624
- No one calls me that


1260
1:8:11,624 --> 1:8:13,98
You need to leave right now.


1261
1:8:13,98 --> 1:8:15,322
I'm really upset, and you need to go.


1262
1:8:15,322 --> 1:8:20,894
- OK!!-


1263
1:8:20,894 --> 1:8:32,806
- Get out!


1264
1:8:32,806 --> 1:8:40,513
# I've got a right to lose my mind #


1265
1:8:40,513 --> 1:8:41,581
# Since... #


1266
1:8:41,581 --> 1:8:43,75
- Well, well, well.


1267
1:8:43,75 --> 1:8:47,454
# Since you left me here #


1268
1:8:47,454 --> 1:8:50,757
- Now I remember you.


1269
1:8:50,757 --> 1:8:53,426
- You do?


1270
1:8:53,426 --> 1:8:56,63
- Not really.


1271
1:8:56,63 --> 1:9:0,5
# I stumbled! #


1272
1:9:0,5 --> 1:9:2,68
# On a new world #


1273
1:9:2,68 --> 1:9:4,437
- Rough day?


1274
1:9:4,437 --> 1:9:9,175
- Yeah.


1275
1:9:9,175 --> 1:9:12,112
- "Mock on.
Mock on.


1276
1:9:12,112 --> 1:9:15,81
"'Tis all in vain.


1277
1:9:15,81 --> 1:9:17,751
"You throw the sand against the wind,


1278
1:9:17,751 --> 1:9:22,122
and the wind
blows it back again."


1279
1:9:22,122 --> 1:9:25,358
- Blake.


1280
1:9:25,358 --> 1:9:28,361
. A-plus.


1281
1:9:28,361 --> 1:9:32,399
- # And the life #


1282
1:9:32,399 --> 1:9:33,64
# And the life I'm living #


1283
1:9:33,64 --> 1:9:37,47
- French fries.


1284
1:9:37,47 --> 1:9:41,7
I wan jun about in order a basket.


1285
1:9:41,7 --> 1:9:42,876
# To lose my mind #


1286
1:9:42,876 --> 1:9:54,954
# I've got a right to lose my mind #


1287
1:9:54,954 --> 1:9:57,59
. HO)'-


1288
1:9:57,59 --> 1:9:59,492
Can you get me a beer'?


1289
1:9:59,492 --> 1:10:2,228
- Yeah, have mine.


1290
1:10:2,228 --> 1:10:4,531
- Of course, I'm thrilled.


1291
1:10:4,531 --> 1:10:6,433
Newly minted PhD.


1292
1:10:6,433 --> 1:10:8,1
I'm feeling very fancy


1293
1:10:8,1 --> 1:10:11,671
and officially teaching Ode on a Grecian Um


1294
1:10:11,671 --> 1:10:13,39
for the first time.


1295
1:10:13,39 --> 1:10:14,374
It's like heaven, right?


1296
1:10:14,374 --> 1:10:15,615
- - Right.
Right. right. right.


1297
1:10:15,615 --> 1:10:17,452
- And I decide to be a little dramatic.


1298
1:10:17,452 --> 1:10:18,719
I'm really gonna go for it


1299
1:10:18,719 --> 1:10:20,386
and just recite the whole thing out loud.


1300
1:10:20,386 --> 1:10:21,416
What the hell, right'?


1301
1:10:21,416 --> 1:10:22,849
- Sure.


1302
1:10:22,849 --> 1:10:26,986
- And it's going very well,
if I do say so myself.


1303
1:10:26,986 --> 1:10:30,623
And as I reach the immortal final lines


1304
1:10:30,623 --> 1:10:34,94
of one of the great poems
ever written in English,


1305
1:10:34,94 --> 1:10:37,564
I hear myself say the following:


1306
1:10:37,564 --> 1:10:42,736
"Beauth is trudy, trudy beauth."


1307
1:10:42,736 --> 1:10:44,774
- "That is all ye know on Earth
and all ye need know."


1308
1:10:44,774 --> 1:10:46,473
- That is great


1309
1:10:46,473 --> 1:10:48,775
Great story.


1310
1:10:48,775 --> 1:10:50,653
When did you fall for the Romantics?


1311
1:10:50,653 --> 1:10:52,178
Was it, like-
I'm just curious,


1312
1:10:52,178 --> 1:10:54,481
but was it in college or grad school?


1313
1:10:54,481 --> 1:10:56,462
'Cause I knew almost nothing about those guys


1314
1:10:56,462 --> 1:10:58,284
before your class.


1315
1:10:58,284 --> 1:10:59,619
Your class.


1316
1:10:59,619 --> 1:11:1,721
Och, I can gush, right'?


1317
1:11:1,721 --> 1:11:3,323
I mean, I still think about it.


1318
1:11:3,323 --> 1:11:7,26
Ifs just-


1319
1:11:7,26 --> 1:11:9,229
What?


1320
1:11:9,229 --> 1:11:13,299
- You're very enthusiastic.


1321
1:11:13,299 --> 1:11:27,313
- I guess.


1322
1:11:27,313 --> 1:11:32,318
- I have a car.


1323
1:11:32,318 --> 1:11:33,586
- ORGY-


1324
1:11:33,586 --> 1:11:40,794
- I would like for you to get in it with me,


1325
1:11:40,794 --> 1:11:47,333
and I would like to drive us somewhere.


1326
1:11:47,333 --> 1:11:57,51
- Where?


1327
1:11:57,51 --> 1:11:59,379
- Don't worry about the fries,


1328
1:11:59,379 --> 1:12:8,87
They know me here.


1329
1:12:8,87 --> 1:12:9,689
up?


1330
1:12:9,689 --> 1:12:33,213
- Oh, hey, man.


1331
1:12:33,213 --> 1:12:35,148
Okay, you got to go.


1332
1:12:35,148 --> 1:12:36,983
- What?


1333
1:12:36,983 --> 1:12:39,319
- Out.
Go, now.


1334
1:12:39,319 --> 1:12:41,387
- Owl Are you serious?


1335
1:12:41,387 --> 1:12:42,956
- YUP-


1336
1:12:42,956 --> 1:12:47,193
- Yeah, I don't have to, uh,
stay the night or anything,


1337
1:12:47,193 --> 1:12:49,562
but could I-could I at least
catch my breath?


1338
1:12:49,562 --> 1:12:52,65
- Sure.


1339
1:12:52,65 --> 1:12:57,403
How long do you think that'll be?


1340
1:12:57,403 --> 1:12:58,678
- What?
- No, no.


1341
1:12:58,678 --> 1:13:1,174
It's just funny to me all of a sudden.


1342
1:13:1,174 --> 1:13:4,21
- What about it is amusing to you'?


1343
1:13:4,21 --> 1:13:8,581
- Your post-coital cigarette,
for one, is amusing to me.


1344
1:13:8,581 --> 1:13:10,183
- What, you never smoked?


1345
1:13:10,183 --> 1:13:12,185
- No, I did.
- But you quit


1346
1:13:12,185 --> 1:13:15,321
- Yeah.
- Pussy.


1347
1:13:15,321 --> 1:13:17,63
- Okay, you are the same Judith Fairfield


1348
1:13:17,63 --> 1:13:18,934
I took British Romantic literature from?


1349
1:13:18,934 --> 1:13:21,338
- "From whom I took
British Romantic literature,"


1350
1:13:21,338 --> 1:13:23,29
and yes, that's me.


1351
1:13:23,29 --> 1:13:25,442
But just because we screwed,
don't assume we're suddenly-


1352
1:13:25,442 --> 1:13:27,767
what is it you kids say nowadays?


1353
1:13:27,767 --> 1:13:29,168
BFFs?


1354
1:13:29,168 --> 1:13:30,443
- Yeah, that's not really-


1355
1:13:30,443 --> 1:13:32,372
- I mean, what do we really know
about each other?


1356
1:13:32,372 --> 1:13:34,46
You're a nonsmoker.
Congratulations.


1357
1:13:34,46 --> 1:13:35,714
You're going to live to be a hundred.


1358
1:13:35,714 --> 1:13:37,777
But what does it matter if your life is joyless?


1359
1:13:37,777 --> 1:13:40,38
And it will be.
Trust me.


1360
1:13:40,38 --> 1:13:41,948
- What's happening here?


1361
1:13:41,948 --> 1:13:44,2
- You're gelling your clothes
and you're leaving,


1362
1:13:44,2 --> 1:13:45,952
and I'm going to take an Ambien.


1363
1:13:45,952 --> 1:13:47,57
- No, I meant, what is hap-


1364
1:13:47,57 --> 1:13:48,294
- I mean, seriously.


1365
1:13:48,294 --> 1:13:50,3
You weren't thinking we were gonna cuddle


1366
1:13:50,3 --> 1:13:52,892
the rest of the night as I read you Wordsworth?


1367
1:13:52,892 --> 1:13:54,894
- Not anymore.


1368
1:13:54,894 --> 1:13:56,629
- Good.


1369
1:13:56,629 --> 1:13:58,765
I've taught at this school for over 20 years.


1370
1:13:58,765 --> 1:14:2,35
I've seen the emergence of
your kind like an infection-


1371
1:14:2,35 --> 1:14:5,138
all these effete,
overarticulate man-boys


1372
1:14:5,138 --> 1:14:6,94
who never learned to toughen up.


1373
1:14:6,94 --> 1:14:8,474
Don't be one of them,


1374
1:14:8,474 --> 1:14:9,613
Go work with your hands.


1375
1:14:9,613 --> 1:14:10,645
Build something.


1376
1:14:10,645 --> 1:14:12,478
Punch someone in the face.


1377
1:14:12,478 --> 1:14:13,98
- WWI.


1378
1:14:13,98 --> 1:14:15,255
Too bad Norman Mailer's dead.


1379
1:14:15,255 --> 1:14:17,16
would have been perfect for each other.


1380
1:14:17,16 --> 1:14:18,323
- Shall I count to ten?


1381
1:14:18,323 --> 1:14:19,32
- Wail, just, can-


1382
1:14:19,32 --> 1:14:26,225
hold on just one second, okay?


1383
1:14:26,225 --> 1:14:30,129
You don't seem very happy.


1384
1:14:30,129 --> 1:14:32,498
Your powers of deduction are stunning.


1385
1:14:32,498 --> 1:14:34,934
You must have gone to a very good college.


1386
1:14:34,934 --> 1:14:37,303
- I'm just confused how-


1387
1:14:37,303 --> 1:14:38,942
I mean, you're a tenured professor


1388
1:14:38,942 --> 1:14:41,674
in one of the most prestigious
English departments


1389
1:14:41,674 --> 1:14:42,71
in the country.


1390
1:14:42,71 --> 1:14:44,544
That's not fulfilling?


1391
1:14:44,544 --> 1:14:46,855
- Sit through a faculty meeting
at a liberal arts college,


1392
1:14:46,855 --> 1:14:48,314
Mr. Young Person.


1393
1:14:48,314 --> 1:14:50,659
I assure you, you will lose
all faith in humanity.


1394
1:14:50,659 --> 1:14:52,885
- Okay, but what about the classroom?


1395
1:14:52,885 --> 1:14:54,729
There had lo have been some joy there


1396
1:14:54,729 --> 1:14:57,123
I mean, you were such a good teacher.


1397
1:14:57,123 --> 1:14:59,192
- Thank you.


1398
1:14:59,192 --> 1:15:1,16
I like to teach.


1399
1:15:1,16 --> 1:15:2,829
I used to love it.


1400
1:15:2,829 --> 1:15:4,364
- What happened?


1401
1:15:4,364 --> 1:15:8,301
- Life happened.


1402
1:15:8,301 --> 1:15:10,67
- Okay, I'm gonna need a little bit more'


1403
1:15:10,67 --> 1:15:12,275
- Well, that's all you're gonna get.


1404
1:15:12,275 --> 1:15:15,375
Unlike you, I'm not from the 'let me tell you


1405
1:15:15,375 --> 1:15:18,111
every sick, sordid detail
of my life" generation.


1406
1:15:18,111 --> 1:15:19,712
I value discretion.


1407
1:15:19,712 --> 1:15:21,748
I loathe self-pity.


1408
1:15:21,748 --> 1:15:23,683
So let's just leave it at this:


1409
1:15:23,683 --> 1:15:27,653
people are disappointing.


1410
1:15:27,653 --> 1:15:29,389
- Yeah, it's just,
I would think-


1411
1:15:29,389 --> 1:15:30,923
- Don't get comfortable.
- Sorry.


1412
1:15:30,923 --> 1:15:32,164
I would just think


1413
1:15:32,164 --> 1:15:34,56
that spending so much time with those poems


1414
1:15:34,56 --> 1:15:38,231
would make you more, you know,
optimistic and hopeful.


1415
1:15:38,231 --> 1:15:39,599
- Nonsense.


1416
1:15:39,599 --> 1:15:40,933
They were miserable men


1417
1:15:40,933 --> 1:15:42,902
who were granted a few moments of transcendence,


1418
1:15:42,902 --> 1:15:44,405
and they had the talent and foresight


1419
1:15:44,405 --> 1:15:46,572
to grab pen and paper and write it down.


1420
1:15:46,572 --> 1:15:48,741
Byron was probably the happiest of the lot,


1421
1:15:48,741 --> 1:15:51,911
only because he put his dick in everything.


1422
1:15:51,911 --> 1:15:54,781
- This is the saddest evening of my life


1423
1:15:54,781 --> 1:15:56,82
- Get used to it.


1424
1:15:56,82 --> 1:15:59,719
My advice to you is this:


1425
1:15:59,719 --> 1:16:9,595
put some armor around that gooey
little heart of yours.


1426
1:16:9,595 --> 1:16:14,534
- Well, at least I appreciate the irony.


1427
1:16:14,534 --> 1:16:16,803
I just had the least romantic night of my life


1428
1:16:16,803 --> 1:16:34,72
with a Romantics professor.


1429
1:16:34,72 --> 1:16:37,457
For what it's worth,


1430
1:16:37,457 --> 1:16:40,626
I meant everything I said about your class.


1431
1:16:40,626 --> 1:16:45,798
It opened something in me,


1432
1:16:45,798 --> 1:16:48,801
and I'm grateful for it.


1433
1:16:48,801 --> 1:16:51,904
And if my heart is gooey,


1434
1:16:51,904 --> 1:17:16,329
you're at least partially responsible for that.


1435
1:17:16,329 --> 1:17:18,931
- So you're still uninspired by admissions.


1436
1:17:18,931 --> 1:17:20,8
- Yeah, pretty much.


1437
1:17:20,8 --> 1:17:23,136
- No little Jesse Fishers out there?


1438
1:17:23,136 --> 1:17:25,705
- Well, if there are, I'm not meeting them,


1439
1:17:25,705 --> 1:17:29,675
- Well, maybe you're just not recognizing them.


1440
1:17:29,675 --> 1:17:31,811
Anyway,


1441
1:17:31,811 --> 1:17:34,28
I do appreciate you coming by.


1442
1:17:34,28 --> 1:17:35,681
I really do.


1443
1:17:35,681 --> 1:17:37,161
It's great to see you one last time


1444
1:17:37,161 --> 1:17:39,952
before I get the hell out of here.


1445
1:17:39,952 --> 1:17:42,355
- You feeling any better about things?


1446
1:17:42,355 --> 1:17:44,457
- Well,


1447
1:17:44,457 --> 1:17:46,492
I tried to turn the clock back.


1448
1:17:46,492 --> 1:17:49,862
it doesn't work.


1449
1:17:49,862 --> 1:17:52,698
- No, it doesn't.


1450
1:17:52,698 --> 1:17:55,902
- Now I just-


1451
1:17:55,902 --> 1:18:1,34
I keep waiting to feel more resolve somehow.


1452
1:18:1,34 --> 1:18:2,877
What if I'm like one of those prisoners


1453
1:18:2,877 --> 1:18:4,377
that gets paroled


1454
1:18:4,377 --> 1:18:6,221
and finds he can't handle life on the outside


1455
1:18:6,221 --> 1:18:7,88
so he commits a petty crime


1456
1:18:7,88 --> 1:18:12,919
so he can go back to what he knows?


1457
1:18:12,919 --> 1:18:18,324
- You think this place is a prison?


1458
1:18:18,324 --> 1:18:25,231
- Well, any place you don't leave is a prison.


1459
1:18:25,231 --> 1:18:28,568
Well, whatever.


1460
1:18:28,568 --> 1:18:32,738
OKAY-
- OK!!-


1461
1:18:32,738 --> 1:18:36,542
Hey.


1462
1:18:36,542 --> 1:18:39,23
You know why you're my second
favorite professor of all time?


1463
1:18:39,23 --> 1:18:40,58
- I have no idea.


1464
1:18:40,58 --> 1:18:46,552
by authors you hated.


1465
1:18:46,552 --> 1:18:52,525
Feel good about what you did here.


1466
1:18:52,525 --> 1:19:2,201
- Thank you.


1467
1:19:2,201 --> 1:19:23,222
Gel in your car now, and leave me be.


1468
1:19:23,222 --> 1:19:26,359
- "Dear Zibby, oven alter all these months,


1469
1:19:26,359 --> 1:19:28,306
"I'm still half-expecting
a letter from you


1470
1:19:28,306 --> 1:19:30,73
"to be sitting in my mailbox.


1471
1:19:30,73 --> 1:19:33,143
"I'm sure you have little left
to say to me at this point,


1472
1:19:33,143 --> 1:19:36,102
'bu! your letters
are very much missed.


1473
1:19:36,102 --> 1:19:39,372
"I know I hurt you, and I'm sorry.


1474
1:19:39,372 --> 1:19:40,94
鄭ny bone-headed moves I made


1475
1:19:40,94 --> 1:19:44,243
'were born of confusion and not malice.


1476
1:19:44,243 --> 1:19:46,812
"That said, I've been feeling
lately the stirring:


1477
1:19:46,812 --> 1:19:49,582
"of something I can only call growth


1478
1:19:49,582 --> 1:19:53,119
"It's a tribute of sorts to say
that someone 16 years my junior


1479
1:19:53,119 --> 1:19:56,622
'helped me finally start acting my age.


1480
1:19:56,622 --> 1:19:59,292
"A wise man in a red hat once told me,


1481
1:19:59,292 --> 1:20:1,827
摘verything is okay.'


1482
1:20:1,827 --> 1:20:4,263
"I didn't believe him then,


1483
1:20:4,263 --> 1:20:15,107
but for some reason,
I'm starting to.'


1484
1:20:15,107 --> 1:20:17,9
- Sorry, we're closed!


1485
1:20:17,9 --> 1:20:18,844
Oh,


1486
1:20:18,844 --> 1:20:19,979
Hey.


1487
1:20:19,979 --> 1:20:26,152
- Hi.


1488
1:20:26,152 --> 1:20:30,189
- Are you here for this?


1489
1:20:30,189 --> 1:20:33,859
I always notice you reading it
when you're in here.


1490
1:20:33,859 --> 1:20:36,28
- Yeah.


1491
1:20:36,28 --> 1:20:37,804
Any bookstore I'm in, I have to read then.


1492
1:20:37,804 --> 1:20:38,97
Last three pages.


1493
1:20:38,97 --> 1:20:42,234
- I know.
They're devastating.


1494
1:20:42,234 --> 1:20:48,708
- Yeah.


1495
1:20:48,708 --> 1:20:49,709
I'm Jesse.


1496
1:20:49,709 --> 1:20:50,876
- I'm Ana.


1497
1:20:50,876 --> 1:20:55,147
- Hi.
- Hi.


1498
1:20:55,147 --> 1:20:57,216
I love books.


1499
1:20:57,216 --> 1:20:59,852
I do in, like, the dorkiest way possible.


1500
1:20:59,852 --> 1:21:0,986
- Oh, me too.


1501
1:21:0,986 --> 1:21:2,355
It's a problem.


1502
1:21:2,355 --> 1:21:6,459
- Like, I love trees cause they give us books.


1503
1:21:6,459 --> 1:21:9,462
super cool of the trees to do that, light'!


1504
1:21:9,462 --> 1:21:11,564
- I'm actually-


1505
1:21:11,564 --> 1:21:13,32
this is weird.


1506
1:21:13,32 --> 1:21:15,267
I'm actually trying to read less.


1507
1:21:15,267 --> 1:21:16,635
- WM?


1508
1:21:16,635 --> 1:21:20,406
- I felt like I wasn't watching
enough television.


1509
1:21:20,406 --> 1:21:23,843
- No, l just-I started to feel
like reading about life


1510
1:21:23,843 --> 1:21:26,912
was taking time away from actually living life,


1511
1:21:26,912 --> 1:21:30,416
so I'm trying to, like,
accept invitations to things,


1512
1:21:30,416 --> 1:21:32,26
say "hi" to the world a little more.


1513
1:21:32,26 --> 1:21:35,254
- That sounds scary.


1514
1:21:35,254 --> 1:21:36,589
It's going well?


1515
1:21:36,589 --> 1:21:38,758
- It's..okay.


1516
1:21:38,758 --> 1:21:40,102
Most of the time when I'm out,


1517
1:21:40,102 --> 1:21:41,663
I keep thinking I'd be so much happier


1518
1:21:41,663 --> 1:21:43,362
in bed with a book,


1519
1:21:43,362 --> 1:21:48,267
and that makes me feel not super cool.


1520
1:21:48,267 --> 1:21:50,503
I still read tons.


1521
1:21:50,503 --> 1:21:54,106
I just feel like I'm more aware
of a book's limitations.


1522
1:21:54,106 --> 1:21:55,941
Does that make sense?


1523
1:21:55,941 --> 1:21:59,211
- Yeah, totally.


1524
1:21:59,211 --> 1:22:0,546
- How am I doing here?


1525
1:22:0,546 --> 1:22:2,424
- What?
Here in this conversation?


1526
1:22:2,424 --> 1:22:3,516
- Yeah.


1527
1:22:3,516 --> 1:22:10,289
- Very well.
You are doing great


1528
1:22:10,289 --> 1:22:14,794
So you maybe want to gel away from these books


1529
1:22:14,794 --> 1:22:17,129
and walk somewhere?


1530
1:22:17,129 --> 1:22:18,597
- Yeah, okay.


1531
1:22:18,597 --> 1:22:20,966
- Really?
do it


1532
1:22:20,966 --> 1:22:23,2
- Great.
Great.


1533
1:22:23,2 --> 1:22:25,404
And feel free to invite
your husband or boyfriend.


1534
1:22:25,404 --> 1:22:27,316
- They're both pretty busy right now, so...


1535
1:22:27,316 --> 1:22:28,65
- Probably just be us, then.


1536
1:22:28,65 --> 1:23:2,7
- Yeah.
Just us.


1537
1:23:2,7 --> 1:23:3,8
- Hello.


1538
1:23:3,8 --> 1:23:5,811
- Oh, hi.


1539
1:23:5,811 --> 1:23:7,847
It's Dean


1540
1:23:7,847 --> 1:23:10,516
Franzen?
We like the same writer.


1541
1:23:10,516 --> 1:23:12,918
- Right, hey.
up?


1542
1:23:12,918 --> 1:23:16,956
- Uh, you gave me your number,
and you told me to call you.


1543
1:23:16,956 --> 1:23:19,492
- Uh, yeah.
No, ifs good to hear from you.


1544
1:23:19,492 --> 1:23:20,86
How are you doing?


1545
1:23:20,86 --> 1:23:25,297
- Uh, I'm pretty good, yeah.


1546
1:23:25,297 --> 1:23:27,166
Things, um-


1547
1:23:27,166 --> 1:23:32,338
I've been-


1548
1:23:32,338 --> 1:23:35,341
- Dean?


1549
1:23:35,341 --> 1:23:38,143
- I just took a bunch of pills.


1550
1:23:38,143 --> 1:23:40,779
- What?


1551
1:23:40,779 --> 1:23:45,5
- I just took a lot of pills.


1552
1:23:45,5 --> 1:23:46,352
- How many'?


1553
1:23:46,352 --> 1:23:52,558
- I don't know.
Um...


1554
1:23:52,558 --> 1:23:53,731
I'm really scared.


1555
1:23:53,731 --> 1:23:55,361
- Where are you'!
- In my dorm.


1556
1:23:55,361 --> 1:23:57,329
- Stay-stay there, okay?


1557
1:23:57,329 --> 1:23:58,998
Stay right there.


1558
1:23:58,998 --> 1:24:0,91
Okay, yeah, just stay ri-
I'm gonna make a call,


1559
1:24:0,91 --> 1:24:2,234
and I'm gonna call-


1560
1:24:2,234 --> 1:24:4,44
I need you lo stay by the phone, though, okay?


1561
1:24:4,44 --> 1:24:7,673
Dean?


1562
1:24:7,673 --> 1:24:10,42
- Miss Hanson to reception area, please


1563
1:24:10,42 --> 1:24:24,924
Miss Hanson.


1564
1:24:24,924 --> 1:24:28,227
- Hey-


1565
1:24:28,227 --> 1:24:31,764
- Hey, man.


1566
1:24:31,764 --> 1:24:34,733
How you feeling?


1567
1:24:34,733 --> 1:24:38,27
- Kind of ridiculous.


1568
1:24:38,27 --> 1:24:40,839
You didn't have to drive all the way out here.


1569
1:24:40,839 --> 1:24:44,143
- I flaw, you bastard.


1570
1:24:44,143 --> 1:24:46,946
- Thanks'


1571
1:24:46,946 --> 1:24:51,283
For picking up the phone.


1572
1:24:51,283 --> 1:24:57,456
I didn't know who else to call.


1573
1:24:57,456 --> 1:24:59,625
- Can I make a suggestion?


1574
1:24:59,625 --> 1:25:0,96
- Yeah.


1575
1:25:0,96 --> 1:25:2,561
- Stop reading this.


1576
1:25:2,561 --> 1:25:4,129
- WM?


1577
1:25:4,129 --> 1:25:8,133
- Because he killed himself,
and you're not gonna do that.


1578
1:25:8,133 --> 1:25:11,7
You need to read something else.


1579
1:25:11,7 --> 1:25:14,473
Listen, don'! be a genius
who dies young.


1580
1:25:14,473 --> 1:25:15,975
Be one who dies old.


1581
1:25:15,975 --> 1:25:17,977
Being old is cool.


1582
1:25:17,977 --> 1:25:20,312
Grow old and die old.


1583
1:25:20,312 --> 1:25:22,615
It's a better arc.


1584
1:25:22,615 --> 1:25:24,316
Listen to me, man.


1585
1:25:24,316 --> 1:25:29,655
This right now, all this stuff you're feeling,


1586
1:25:29,655 --> 1:25:31,924
this is a footnote, okay'?


1587
1:25:31,924 --> 1:25:33,792
You're gonna graduate,


1588
1:25:33,792 --> 1:25:36,61
and you're gonna get out in the world


1589
1:25:36,61 --> 1:25:38,497
and stumble into something like contentment.


1590
1:25:38,497 --> 1:25:41,767
I know it.


1591
1:25:41,767 --> 1:25:43,836
- In that how ifs been for you?


1592
1:25:43,836 --> 1:25:47,84
- Hell, no.


1593
1:25:47,84 --> 1:25:51,343
But some days are all right, you know?


1594
1:25:51,343 --> 1:25:54,613
Some days are like a gift,


1595
1:25:54,613 --> 1:25:56,949
and some days suck.


1596
1:25:56,949 --> 1:26:2,788
But all of that's okay.


1597
1:26:2,788 --> 1:26:6,859
So I'm taking you
off post-modernists.


1598
1:26:6,859 --> 1:26:9,628
What are you prescribing?


1599
1:26:9,628 --> 1:26:13,32
- There are these vampire books.


1600
1:26:13,32 --> 1:26:15,334
The kids love 'em.


1601
1:26:15,334 --> 1:26:24,209
Trust me, they will empty your mind completely.


1602
1:26:24,209 --> 1:26:29,181
- Why are you being so nice to me?


1603
1:26:29,181 --> 1:26:31,383
You flew all the way beck here to see me,


1604
1:26:31,383 --> 1:26:34,586
and we had, like, two conversations.


1605
1:26:34,586 --> 1:26:38,49
- I have a soft spot for good readers.


1606
1:26:38,49 --> 1:27:1,246
They're hard to find these days'


1607
1:27:1,246 --> 1:27:4,983
- I really did miss you.


1608
1:27:4,983 --> 1:27:7,52
You know, we had this thing happening,


1609
1:27:7,52 --> 1:27:13,892
and it was so exciting,
and then you were just gone.


1610
1:27:13,892 --> 1:27:15,928
But it's okay now.


1611
1:27:15,928 --> 1:27:23,102
I get it.


1612
1:27:23,102 --> 1:27:28,207
I sometimes feel like
I'm looking down on myself,


1613
1:27:28,207 --> 1:27:32,878
this older, wiser mu


1614
1:27:32,878 --> 1:27:36,882
watching over
this 19-year-old rough draft


1615
1:27:36,882 --> 1:27:40,953
who's full of all this potential


1616
1:27:40,953 --> 1:27:44,289
but has to live more


1617
1:27:44,289 --> 1:27:48,761
to catch up with that other self somehow.


1618
1:27:48,761 --> 1:27:51,764
And...


1619
1:27:51,764 --> 1:27:53,132
I know I'll get there.


1620
1:27:53,132 --> 1:27:56,135
It's just sometimes I think


1621
1:27:56,135 --> 1:28:0,773
I want to rush the process, you know?


1622
1:28:0,773 --> 1:28:2,341
And I don't know.


1623
1:28:2,341 --> 1:28:12,317
Maybe-maybe I thought
you were some sort of shortcut.


1624
1:28:12,317 --> 1:28:18,824
Does that make any sense?


1625
1:28:18,824 --> 1:28:22,961
- If I wrote you, I would be like


1626
1:28:22,961 --> 1:28:34,139
"This is
the but rough draft ever.'


1627
1:28:34,139 --> 1:28:39,511
- Seriously?


1628
1:28:39,511 --> 1:28:44,683
- Roommates.


1629
1:28:44,683 --> 1:28:49,955
- Well, I should gel back lo adulthood.


1630
1:28:49,955 --> 1:28:51,156
- Yeah.


1631
1:28:51,156 --> 1:28:57,696
See you there soon, I guess.


1632
1:28:57,696 --> 1:28:59,865
. Bye, Zibby.


1633
1:28:59,865 --> 1:29:56,255
- Bye, Jesse


1634
1:29:56,255 --> 1:30:0,859
- You're so beautiful and fascinating


1635
1:30:0,859 --> 1:30:1,998
and age-appropriate.


1636
1:30:1,998 --> 1:30:3,61
- What?


1637
1:30:3,61 --> 1:30:5,43
- Oh, nothing.


1638
1:30:5,43 --> 1:30:7,99
# Toma #
# Toma #


1639
1:30:7,99 --> 1:30:9,468
# Zefiro #
# Toma, toma #


1640
1:30:9,468 --> 1:30:11,3
# Toma, zefiro #


1641
1:30:11,3 --> 1:30:14,273
# Ze... #


1642
1:30:14,273 --> 1:30:21,78
# Firo toma #


1643
1:30:21,78 --> 1:30:24,917
# E di soavi accenti #


1644
1:30:24,917 --> 1:30:28,253
# L'aer fa grato #


1645
1:30:28,253 --> 1:30:46,138
# E di soavi accenti... #


1646
1:30:46,138 --> 1:30:48,473
- Look, you're getting wise.


1647
1:30:48,473 --> 1:30:50,642
- I'm getting old.


1648
1:30:50,642 --> 1:30:54,98
- Not the same thing.
I say you're getting wise.


1649
1:30:54,98 --> 1:30:59,51
You worry about getting old?


1650
1:30:59,51 --> 1:31:1,453
- I think being old's gonna be okay.


1651
1:31:1,453 --> 1:31:4,156
It's just the getting there
that kicks your ass, you know?


1652
1:31:4,156 --> 1:31:6,458
- You're gonna be a great old guy.


1653
1:31:6,458 --> 1:31:7,759
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.


1654
1:31:7,759 --> 1:31:9,227
- I feel like the nicest thing


1655
1:31:9,227 --> 1:31:10,639
anyone's ever said to me.


1656
1:31:10,639 --> 1:31:12,297
Unless it's a criticism,


1657
1:31:12,297 --> 1:31:14,8
like, "You're already judgmental and racist.


1658
1:31:14,8 --> 1:31:16,668
You're gonna be
a great old guy."


1659
1:31:16,668 --> 1:31:20,138
- No, I mean you'll wear baggy pants,


1660
1:31:20,138 --> 1:31:22,7
and you'll have a little belly,


1661
1:31:22,7 --> 1:31:24,977
And when you want more coffee,
you'll say to the waitress,


1662
1:31:24,977 --> 1:31:27,346
"Could you warm this up
for me, dear?'


1663
1:31:27,346 --> 1:31:29,181
- You're right.


1664
1:31:29,181 --> 1:31:31,683
I will say that.


1665
1:31:31,683 --> 1:31:34,252
I think you're gonna be a great old person too.


1666
1:31:34,252 --> 1:31:38,523
- Thanks'


1667
1:31:38,523 --> 1:31:43,195
I want to be an old lady with
long, gray hair in a ponytail.


1668
1:31:43,195 --> 1:31:45,97
- I can see it.


1669
1:31:45,97 --> 1:31:46,873
You're still foxy.
You still got it.


1670
1:31:46,873 --> 1:31:48,539
That's what they're gonna 85?'
about you.


1671
1:31:48,539 --> 1:31:49,569
"She's still got it.?


1672
1:31:49,569 --> 1:31:53,205
- They're saying it now.


1673
1:31:53,205 --> 1:31:58,577
And I want a really, really wrinkly face.


1674
1:31:58,577 --> 1:32:12,324
A small house, maybe by some water.


1675
1:32:12,324 --> 1:32:33,345
I think getting old could be really nice.


1676
1:32:33,345 --> 1:32:38,316
# End of the day #
# on the subway #


1677
1:32:38,316 --> 1:32:40,485
# In my ear! #


1678
1:32:40,485 --> 1:32:45,424

1712
1:34:45,51 --> 1:34:47,646

1713
1:34:47,646 --> 1:34:52,184

1714
1:34:52,184 --> 1:34:57,722
# To a really Kenyon man #


1715
1:34:57,722 --> 1:35:0,192
# I want a Kenyon man #


1716
1:35:0,192 --> 1:35:2,6
# Just a Kenyon man #


1717
1:35:2,6 --> 1:35:4,362
# You can't beat a Kenyon man #


1718
1:35:4,362 --> 1:35:6,31
# You can't beat a Kenyon man #

1:35:6,31 --> 1:35:7,999
