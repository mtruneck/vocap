1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:0,61



2
0:0:0,61 --> 0:0:3,93
ANTHONY BOURDAIN: I was in
Bangkok, and I try to get on


3
0:0:3,93 --> 0:0:4,38
the elevator on the
15th floor.


4
0:0:4,38 --> 0:0:5,1
The doors open.


5
0:0:5,1 --> 0:0:7,95
There's Steven Seagal in a
little Nancy Kwan outfit with


6
0:0:7,95 --> 0:0:10,32
a prayer rug holding his
massive girth and 2


7
0:0:10,32 --> 0:0:10,87
bodyguards.


8
0:0:10,87 --> 0:0:12,78
It was like, next elevator.


9
0:0:12,78 --> 0:0:16,59
It's like, what the fuck?


10
0:0:16,59 --> 0:0:18,53
Is it direct-to-video,
motherfucker?


11
0:0:18,53 --> 0:0:21,19
I can't take the same
elevator as this


12
0:0:21,19 --> 0:0:22,7
jowly fucking hairball?


13
0:0:22,7 --> 0:0:25,82
What the fuck?


14
0:0:25,82 --> 0:0:27,465
Yeah, but I've talked a lot of
shit about Steven Seagal


15
0:0:27,465 --> 0:0:30,51
lately, so if you see
him tonight, that's


16
0:0:30,51 --> 0:0:31,39
what those are for.


17
0:0:31,39 --> 0:0:32,17
He's got a reach.


18
0:0:32,17 --> 0:0:32,82
HELEN CHO: Next elevator.


19
0:0:32,82 --> 0:0:34,242
ANTHONY BOURDAIN: Get
under his reach.


20
0:0:34,242 --> 0:0:35,19
Get under his reach.


21
0:0:35,19 --> 0:0:36,73
DIANE SCHUTZ: --On the street.


22
0:0:36,73 --> 0:0:37,56
Just on the street.


23
0:0:37,56 --> 0:0:38,81
HELEN CHO: Next elevator,
motherfucker.


24
0:0:38,81 --> 0:0:49,876



25
0:0:49,876 --> 0:0:54,52
ANTHONY BOURDAIN: My name's
Anthony Bourdain, and I work


26
0:0:54,52 --> 0:0:57,5
with Zero Point Zero Production
making a television


27
0:0:57,5 --> 0:0:58,875
show called No Reservations.


28
0:0:58,875 --> 0:1:1,55
I travel around the world eating
and drinking and making


29
0:1:1,55 --> 0:1:3,34
self-indulgent television.


30
0:1:3,34 --> 0:1:5,58
We have a core road crew.


31
0:1:5,58 --> 0:1:7,82
Diane Schutz, segment
producer.


32
0:1:7,82 --> 0:1:11,7
Helen Cho, the director
of social media.


33
0:1:11,7 --> 0:1:13,28
Zach Zamboni is a


34
0:1:13,28 --> 0:1:15,27
cinematographer and a shooter--


35
0:1:15,27 --> 0:1:16,44
camera person.


36
0:1:16,44 --> 0:1:20,49
Then, of course, Tom Vitale,
my go-to producer.


37
0:1:20,49 --> 0:1:23,75
Basically, these are my partners
in telling stories


38
0:1:23,75 --> 0:1:25,1
all over the world.


39
0:1:25,1 --> 0:1:26,6
These are the people who
I spend most of my


40
0:1:26,6 --> 0:1:27,725
waking hours with.


41
0:1:27,725 --> 0:1:30,84
They're my closest associates
and friends.


42
0:1:30,84 --> 0:1:32,695
I have something to present
to you tonight.


43
0:1:32,695 --> 0:1:33,24
HELEN CHO: Oh, no.


44
0:1:33,24 --> 0:1:36,11
ANTHONY BOURDAIN:
This is for you.


45
0:1:36,11 --> 0:1:37,59
You might need this later.


46
0:1:37,59 --> 0:1:39,75
HELEN CHO: Oh, I will.


47
0:1:39,75 --> 0:1:39,91
That's sick.


48
0:1:39,91 --> 0:1:40,97
DIANE SCHUTZ: That's
pretty awesome.


49
0:1:40,97 --> 0:1:42,25
ZACH ZAMBONI: Let's go eat.


50
0:1:42,25 --> 0:1:43,97
ANTHONY BOURDAIN: I had
no life outside of


51
0:1:43,97 --> 0:1:44,73
the restaurant business.


52
0:1:44,73 --> 0:1:47,47
I was at work all day, and at
night, I would go out with


53
0:1:47,47 --> 0:1:50,24
other chefs and talk
about business.


54
0:1:50,24 --> 0:1:53,72
So the transition to television,
in that regard,


55
0:1:53,72 --> 0:1:54,8
isn't that much of a leap.


56
0:1:54,8 --> 0:1:55,35
What do I do?


57
0:1:55,35 --> 0:1:56,31
I work all day.


58
0:1:56,31 --> 0:1:57,97
I'm friends with the
people I work with.


59
0:1:57,97 --> 0:2:0,31
And when we're not working, when
the cameras are off, we


60
0:2:0,31 --> 0:2:2,78
continue to eat and drink
and talk about work.


61
0:2:2,78 --> 0:2:3,58
So--


62
0:2:3,58 --> 0:2:6,292
there it is.


63
0:2:6,292 --> 0:2:8,736
ZACH ZAMBONI: We're going
to Salumeria Rosi.


64
0:2:8,736 --> 0:2:10,72
ANTHONY BOURDAIN: Every once in
a while, like special treat


65
0:2:10,72 --> 0:2:14,96
at the Bourdain household, I'll
run over there and buy a


66
0:2:14,96 --> 0:2:17,56
big pile of meat.


67
0:2:17,56 --> 0:2:19,6
We're going to see the wizard.


68
0:2:19,6 --> 0:2:20,85
The wonderful wizard of meat.


69
0:2:20,85 --> 0:2:31,155



70
0:2:31,155 --> 0:2:32,145
Thank you for hosting us.


71
0:2:32,145 --> 0:2:32,985
ZACH ZAMBONI: Hey, Cesare.


72
0:2:32,985 --> 0:2:33,76
CESARE CASELLA: Hey,
how are you?


73
0:2:33,76 --> 0:2:33,893
ANTHONY BOURDAIN: Cesare's
an old friend.


74
0:2:33,893 --> 0:2:35,43
He's made a bunch of
shows with us.


75
0:2:35,43 --> 0:2:37,656
Cesare, like a lot of the chefs
I've come to know and


76
0:2:37,656 --> 0:2:40,6
who I've come to be close
friends with--


77
0:2:40,6 --> 0:2:44,95
as is so often the case in my
fucked-up, dysfunctional, but


78
0:2:44,95 --> 0:2:45,97
wonderful life--


79
0:2:45,97 --> 0:2:48,852
we started out as TV friends
and became real friends.


80
0:2:48,852 --> 0:2:51,618
SERVER: Are you--
you order, or--


81
0:2:51,618 --> 0:2:54,925
ANTHONY BOURDAIN: I think what
we'd like is a selection of


82
0:2:54,925 --> 0:2:55,69
cured meat.


83
0:2:55,69 --> 0:2:56,22
CESARE CASELLA: OK.


84
0:2:56,22 --> 0:2:56,98
ZACH ZAMBONI: A little
bit of cheese.


85
0:2:56,98 --> 0:2:58,408
ANTHONY BOURDAIN: Just split.


86
0:2:58,408 --> 0:2:59,36
CESARE CASELLA: Fantastic.


87
0:2:59,36 --> 0:3:1,27
ANTHONY BOURDAIN: Beautiful.


88
0:3:1,27 --> 0:3:4,83
Good cured meat is something
that's always good.


89
0:3:4,83 --> 0:3:6,68
It won't be too punishing
early on.


90
0:3:6,68 --> 0:3:7,9
We're going for the
long haul, here.


91
0:3:7,9 --> 0:3:10,9
Experience has taught me that it
would have been a bad idea


92
0:3:10,9 --> 0:3:14,56
to start off with a pasta
tasting earlier in the meal,


93
0:3:14,56 --> 0:3:17,1
followed by meat
and more drink.


94
0:3:17,1 --> 0:3:18,186
I couldn't do that
to my friends.


95
0:3:18,186 --> 0:3:19,33
ZACH ZAMBONI: Whoa!


96
0:3:19,33 --> 0:3:21,9
DIANE SCHUTZ: OK, that's
tweetworthy.


97
0:3:21,9 --> 0:3:22,97
ANTHONY BOURDAIN:
Look at that.


98
0:3:22,97 --> 0:3:25,86
It's a low-impact place to grab
really good food, and one


99
0:3:25,86 --> 0:3:28,787
of those places that I think,
just by existing, are


100
0:3:28,787 --> 0:3:29,685
good for the world.


101
0:3:29,685 --> 0:3:33,59
I mean, he makes and sells
products there that other


102
0:3:33,59 --> 0:3:35,88
people either don't
do, wouldn't do,


103
0:3:35,88 --> 0:3:38,4
or can't do as well.


104
0:3:38,4 --> 0:3:41,83
And I think it's just a person
and a place that I feel really


105
0:3:41,83 --> 0:3:43,84
connected to.


106
0:3:43,84 --> 0:3:46,94
It's a happy day for me when
I can go there [INAUDIBLE].


107
0:3:46,94 --> 0:3:47,87
Delicious.


108
0:3:47,87 --> 0:3:48,42
HELEN CHO: Amazing.


109
0:3:48,42 --> 0:3:51,418
CESARE CASELLA: So this is
the fagioli [INAUDIBLE].


110
0:3:51,418 --> 0:3:52,386
DIANE SCHUTZ: Nice.


111
0:3:52,386 --> 0:3:54,806
ANTHONY BOURDAIN:
I love that man.


112
0:3:54,806 --> 0:3:58,6
See, this is something that's
just irresistible to me.


113
0:3:58,6 --> 0:4:0,4
I'm happy now.


114
0:4:0,4 --> 0:4:2,16
This is exactly how
I like to eat.


115
0:4:2,16 --> 0:4:4,95



116
0:4:4,95 --> 0:4:7,955
Part of the process of making
the show is tweeting about it


117
0:4:7,955 --> 0:4:9,24
and engaging the fans.


118
0:4:9,24 --> 0:4:10,48
We're all serial tweeters.


119
0:4:10,48 --> 0:4:12,78
It's at the pathetic point.


120
0:4:12,78 --> 0:4:14,27
We are some sad motherfuckers
here.


121
0:4:14,27 --> 0:4:16,89
Look at us.


122
0:4:16,89 --> 0:4:17,59
ZACH ZAMBONI: Like a
bunch of tweens.


123
0:4:17,59 --> 0:4:20,74
ANTHONY BOURDAIN: Right.


124
0:4:20,74 --> 0:4:24,195
So, the question I had in my
mind tonight was, if any of


125
0:4:24,195 --> 0:4:28,2
you got like some big hunk of
sauce or mashed bean hanging


126
0:4:28,2 --> 0:4:31,405
off your cheek, would
I tell you?


127
0:4:31,405 --> 0:4:32,47
HELEN CHO: Yeah, would you?


128
0:4:32,47 --> 0:4:33,84
ANTHONY BOURDAIN: You know,
revenge for season 2.


129
0:4:33,84 --> 0:4:36,97
There was one episode where I
had a nostril hair like this


130
0:4:36,97 --> 0:4:38,9
long hanging out--
a crusty one.


131
0:4:38,9 --> 0:4:40,12
DIANE SCHUTZ: Oh, you
mean New Zealand?


132
0:4:40,12 --> 0:4:41,8
ZACH ZAMBONI: That
was Uzbekistan.


133
0:4:41,8 --> 0:4:42,44
ANTHONY BOURDAIN: Excellent.


134
0:4:42,44 --> 0:4:46,74
I mean, everybody on TV has to
live with the likelihood that


135
0:4:46,74 --> 0:4:52,55
if they hit their head, shit
their pants, get arrested--


136
0:4:52,55 --> 0:4:56,29
that they will themselves
end up on camera.


137
0:4:56,29 --> 0:4:59,62
But for a sustained night
out with a camera


138
0:4:59,62 --> 0:5:1,9
relentlessly on them--


139
0:5:1,9 --> 0:5:3,46
were they uncomfortable?


140
0:5:3,46 --> 0:5:4,35
Who cares.


141
0:5:4,35 --> 0:5:6,195
I wallowed in their
discomfort.


142
0:5:6,195 --> 0:5:9,655
ZACH ZAMBONI: We usually drink
when we shoot, so feel free.


143
0:5:9,655 --> 0:5:12,4
ANTHONY BOURDAIN: Everybody we
got with is like, such an old


144
0:5:12,4 --> 0:5:13,18
whore, productionwise.


145
0:5:13,18 --> 0:5:15,411
CAMERAMAN: Zach, you can't be
shooting this show, either.


146
0:5:15,411 --> 0:5:17,666
ZACH ZAMBONI: OK, here.


147
0:5:17,666 --> 0:5:21,3
ANTHONY BOURDAIN: Zach's
thinking about the lighting.


148
0:5:21,3 --> 0:5:23,12
Diane's bussing the table.


149
0:5:23,12 --> 0:5:26,3
And I'm thinking, well,
did you pay?


150
0:5:26,3 --> 0:5:28,46
Because there is really now
lower person in this world


151
0:5:28,46 --> 0:5:30,86
than somebody who ends
up stiffing waiters.


152
0:5:30,86 --> 0:5:34,822
There is a 10th circle of
hell just for them.


153
0:5:34,822 --> 0:5:35,77
So that guy's paying?


154
0:5:35,77 --> 0:5:36,244
[INTERPOSING VOICES]


155
0:5:36,244 --> 0:5:37,666
ANTHONY BOURDAIN: OK, good.


156
0:5:37,666 --> 0:5:38,62
Tack on--


157
0:5:38,62 --> 0:5:39,18
DIANE SCHUTZ: Thank you.


158
0:5:39,18 --> 0:5:39,865
SERVER: You're very welcome.


159
0:5:39,865 --> 0:5:40,18
Have fun tonight.


160
0:5:40,18 --> 0:5:41,115
ANTHONY BOURDAIN:
Did he tip well?


161
0:5:41,115 --> 0:5:42,116
ZACH ZAMBONI: 30%.


162
0:5:42,116 --> 0:5:45,123
ANTHONY BOURDAIN: 30%.


163
0:5:45,123 --> 0:5:46,45
OK.


164
0:5:46,45 --> 0:5:46,51
Damn.


165
0:5:46,51 --> 0:5:47,14
HELEN CHO: Damn.


166
0:5:47,14 --> 0:5:49,653
ANTHONY BOURDAIN: We don't
tip that well.


167
0:5:49,653 --> 0:5:51,54
Let's pretend you were producing
this segment.


168
0:5:51,54 --> 0:5:53,32
How would we deal with
this transition here?


169
0:5:53,32 --> 0:5:54,944
Did you risk [INAUDIBLE]?


170
0:5:54,944 --> 0:5:56,52
Did you say, ask them where
we're going now?


171
0:5:56,52 --> 0:5:59,16
HELEN CHO: Damn, he's onto us.


172
0:5:59,16 --> 0:6:0,385
DIANE SCHUTZ: Shit.


173
0:6:0,385 --> 0:6:2,71
ANTHONY BOURDAIN: Apparently
we'll be moving on to The


174
0:6:2,71 --> 0:6:3,35
Distinguished Wakamba Lounge.


175
0:6:3,35 --> 0:6:5,9
Do you like a little
Latin flavor?


176
0:6:5,9 --> 0:6:8,437
Do you like 8th Avenue
in the '30s?


177
0:6:8,437 --> 0:6:10,433
DIANE SCHUTZ: That's my
[INTERPOSING VOICES].


178
0:6:10,433 --> 0:6:17,918



179
0:6:17,918 --> 0:6:19,33
ANTHONY BOURDAIN: I've never
puked in front of


180
0:6:19,33 --> 0:6:20,14
witnesses in my life.


181
0:6:20,14 --> 0:6:20,992
DIANE SCHUTZ: Ever?


182
0:6:20,992 --> 0:6:22,508
ANTHONY BOURDAIN: And I'm
not going to start now.


183
0:6:22,508 --> 0:6:23,105
DIANE SCHUTZ: Really?


184
0:6:23,105 --> 0:6:23,225
Ever?


185
0:6:23,225 --> 0:6:23,464
Come on.


186
0:6:23,464 --> 0:6:24,898
HELEN CHO: Tonight is
the night, Tony.


187
0:6:24,898 --> 0:6:27,505
Tonight is the night.


188
0:6:27,505 --> 0:6:29,47
ANTHONY BOURDAIN: When I was a
junkie, I would throw up in


189
0:6:29,47 --> 0:6:30,35
the great outdoors.


190
0:6:30,35 --> 0:6:35,97
But outside of the heroin
experience, no.


191
0:6:35,97 --> 0:6:38,315
I still remember the girl who
threw up next to me in second


192
0:6:38,315 --> 0:6:41,53
grade, so that was an important
experience.


193
0:6:41,53 --> 0:6:42,94
Terry Jones--


194
0:6:42,94 --> 0:6:46,74
lifted up her desk and blew
chunks into her desk.


195
0:6:46,74 --> 0:6:47,27
OK?


196
0:6:47,27 --> 0:6:48,88
And that made a big
impression on me.


197
0:6:48,88 --> 0:6:50,93
And I was like, that's
not going to be me.


198
0:6:50,93 --> 0:6:53,64
So I'm pretty good at holding
onto my shit.


199
0:6:53,64 --> 0:6:56,67
Thank you.


200
0:6:56,67 --> 0:6:58,59
I know a bar with a pool.


201
0:6:58,59 --> 0:7:1,33
It's right behind the bar,
the swimming pool is.


202
0:7:1,33 --> 0:7:4,57
Last time I was there, I
got fucking buck naked.


203
0:7:4,57 --> 0:7:7,448
That was quite some
time ago, but--


204
0:7:7,448 --> 0:7:8,44
yeah.


205
0:7:8,44 --> 0:7:9,52
Pre-fatherhood.


206
0:7:9,52 --> 0:7:11,263
I'm a distinguished
motherfucker now.


207
0:7:11,263 --> 0:7:12,8
ZACH ZAMBONI: Yeah, it's true.


208
0:7:12,8 --> 0:7:14,57
ANTHONY BOURDAIN: Hence The
Distinguished Wakamba Lounge.


209
0:7:14,57 --> 0:7:15,82
ZACH ZAMBONI: Yes.


210
0:7:15,82 --> 0:7:18,634



211
0:7:18,634 --> 0:7:20,38
ANTHONY BOURDAIN: We're all
thinking the same thing when


212
0:7:20,38 --> 0:7:22,73
we go into a restaurant
or a bar.


213
0:7:22,73 --> 0:7:24,19
First thing we're thinking
is music.


214
0:7:24,19 --> 0:7:24,93
You can't afford that music.


215
0:7:24,93 --> 0:7:25,878
ZACH ZAMBONI: Uh-oh.


216
0:7:25,878 --> 0:7:26,826
Unplug the jukebox.


217
0:7:26,826 --> 0:7:30,618
DIANE SCHUTZ: Stop producing
the show.


218
0:7:30,618 --> 0:7:33,48
ANTHONY BOURDAIN: The
Distinguished Wakamba Lounge--


219
0:7:33,48 --> 0:7:36,12
one of the last dive
bars of its kind.


220
0:7:36,12 --> 0:7:39,401
There are plenty of Irish dive
bars around, but this is


221
0:7:39,401 --> 0:7:41,942
really something unique
to Manhattan.


222
0:7:41,942 --> 0:7:42,92
ANTHONY BOURDAIN: Presidente?


223
0:7:42,92 --> 0:7:46,45
Definitely you want to be
drinking the Presidente--


224
0:7:46,45 --> 0:7:47,57
good stuff there.


225
0:7:47,57 --> 0:7:50,21
They keep it properly cold,
as any proud Dominican


226
0:7:50,21 --> 0:7:51,494
[INAUDIBLE] should be.


227
0:7:51,494 --> 0:7:56,404



228
0:7:56,404 --> 0:7:58,859
All right, so who's
been here before?


229
0:7:58,859 --> 0:7:59,841
ZACH ZAMBONI: No one?


230
0:7:59,841 --> 0:8:1,314
DIANE SCHUTZ: No, never.


231
0:8:1,314 --> 0:8:2,296
ANTHONY BOURDAIN: Why?


232
0:8:2,296 --> 0:8:2,787
It's enchanting?


233
0:8:2,787 --> 0:8:4,26
ZACH ZAMBONI: How come
we haven't shot here?


234
0:8:4,26 --> 0:8:5,242
HELEN CHO: No, we were going
to shoot for the holiday.


235
0:8:5,242 --> 0:8:6,224
ANTHONY BOURDAIN: This one's
my special place.


236
0:8:6,224 --> 0:8:7,71
ZACH ZAMBONI: Aw, you didn't
want to fuck it up.


237
0:8:7,71 --> 0:8:9,76
ANTHONY BOURDAIN: The Wakamba
Lounge has remained unchanged,


238
0:8:9,76 --> 0:8:12,35
unapologetically and
unironically.


239
0:8:12,35 --> 0:8:13,91
That's important.


240
0:8:13,91 --> 0:8:16,43
There's nothing hipster about
the Wakamba Lounge.


241
0:8:16,43 --> 0:8:17,96
It is what it is.


242
0:8:17,96 --> 0:8:20,474
Anyone who's just compelled to
go there after having seen


243
0:8:20,474 --> 0:8:21,73
this-- please don't
fuck it up.


244
0:8:21,73 --> 0:8:23,17
So what are we drinking
shots of?


245
0:8:23,17 --> 0:8:24,66
Because we're drinking
shots of something.


246
0:8:24,66 --> 0:8:25,59
Definitely not tequila.


247
0:8:25,59 --> 0:8:27,2
HELEN CHO: No, let's
do whiskey.


248
0:8:27,2 --> 0:8:28,3
ANTHONY BOURDAIN: Whiskey.


249
0:8:28,3 --> 0:8:28,9
I think Jameson.


250
0:8:28,9 --> 0:8:29,535
HELEN CHO: Jame-o?


251
0:8:29,535 --> 0:8:30,898
ANTHONY BOURDAIN: A good
Catholic whiskey.


252
0:8:30,898 --> 0:8:31,896
HELEN CHO: Let's just
drink Jame-o.


253
0:8:31,896 --> 0:8:32,894
ANTHONY BOURDAIN: Jame-o.


254
0:8:32,894 --> 0:8:33,892
DIANE SCHUTZ: You sound
so Williamsburg.


255
0:8:33,892 --> 0:8:34,89
HELEN CHO: What?


256
0:8:34,89 --> 0:8:36,387
I am not from Williamsburg,
Diane.


257
0:8:36,387 --> 0:8:37,884
DIANE SCHUTZ: I'm just
saying it sounded--


258
0:8:37,884 --> 0:8:39,88
HELEN CHO: I'm from Brooklyn.


259
0:8:39,88 --> 0:8:40,919
Oh, sorry.


260
0:8:40,919 --> 0:8:42,25
ZACH ZAMBONI: Come
here, buddy.


261
0:8:42,25 --> 0:8:43,0
Come on, pal.


262
0:8:43,0 --> 0:8:43,37
Yeah.


263
0:8:43,37 --> 0:8:46,49
ANTHONY BOURDAIN: In order to
be on this show, if you want


264
0:8:46,49 --> 0:8:48,2
the shot, you take the shot.


265
0:8:48,2 --> 0:8:48,847
ZACH ZAMBONI: Yeah.


266
0:8:48,847 --> 0:8:52,96
ANTHONY BOURDAIN: That's
the way it works.


267
0:8:52,96 --> 0:8:54,37
Yeah, there's no getting in and
out of there without doing


268
0:8:54,37 --> 0:8:56,15
a few shots.


269
0:8:56,15 --> 0:8:58,28
I just love that place.


270
0:8:58,28 --> 0:9:0,528
It's politically incorrect.


271
0:9:0,528 --> 0:9:3,5
So, Helen.


272
0:9:3,5 --> 0:9:4,29
I pledge to you now.


273
0:9:4,29 --> 0:9:6,218
HELEN CHO: And this
is not drunk talk.


274
0:9:6,218 --> 0:9:6,965
This is real talk.


275
0:9:6,965 --> 0:9:9,182
ANTHONY BOURDAIN: I will sing
Mark Lanegan's "Wedding Dress"


276
0:9:9,182 --> 0:9:10,655
at your wedding.


277
0:9:10,655 --> 0:9:12,62
HELEN CHO: You fucking
pinky-swear me, dude!


278
0:9:12,62 --> 0:9:13,74
ANTHONY BOURDAIN: Nice
Korean boy, though.


279
0:9:13,74 --> 0:9:17,979
HELEN CHO: He has
to be Korean?


280
0:9:17,979 --> 0:9:21,136
ANTHONY BOURDAIN: I've been
talking to your mom, yo.


281
0:9:21,136 --> 0:9:23,128
HELEN CHO: And a Christian--


282
0:9:23,128 --> 0:9:24,622
ANTHONY BOURDAIN: Mazel tov.


283
0:9:24,622 --> 0:9:26,116
HELEN CHO: Mazel tov.


284
0:9:26,116 --> 0:9:27,61
DIANE SCHUTZ: Mazel tov!


285
0:9:27,61 --> 0:9:38,68



286
0:9:38,68 --> 0:9:39,64
HELEN CHO: Oh my God.


287
0:9:39,64 --> 0:9:41,554
I'm going to get
so fired, man.


288
0:9:41,554 --> 0:9:43,546
What do you think
of [INAUDIBLE]?


289
0:9:43,546 --> 0:9:44,9
ANTHONY BOURDAIN:
What the fuck?


290
0:9:44,9 --> 0:9:45,824
I entrusted you with
this terrible--


291
0:9:45,824 --> 0:9:47,155
HELEN CHO: I won't care.


292
0:9:47,155 --> 0:9:47,81
I'll put it away.


293
0:9:47,81 --> 0:9:48,3
ANTHONY BOURDAIN: --Power.


294
0:9:48,3 --> 0:9:49,5
You keep it in the
fucking silo.


295
0:9:49,5 --> 0:9:50,78
Get in there, yo.


296
0:9:50,78 --> 0:9:52,3
Jesus.


297
0:9:52,3 --> 0:9:53,73



298
0:9:53,73 --> 0:9:55,64
I mean, late night, you want
to keep it simple.


299
0:9:55,64 --> 0:9:58,765
You're going to be beyond your
powers to evaluate a fine


300
0:9:58,765 --> 0:9:59,52
dining experience.


301
0:9:59,52 --> 0:10:2,5
Your ability to be a good
customer is certainly


302
0:10:2,5 --> 0:10:2,78
diminishing.


303
0:10:2,78 --> 0:10:4,49
Some of us get a little
rowdy late at night.


304
0:10:4,49 --> 0:10:6,54
So I figured it would
be a good idea to


305
0:10:6,54 --> 0:10:8,29
keep it close to home.


306
0:10:8,29 --> 0:10:11,7
So that means my old base of
operations, Les Halles, where


307
0:10:11,7 --> 0:10:13,21
it all started for me.


308
0:10:13,21 --> 0:10:15,288
We'll be having a classic
French meal.


309
0:10:15,288 --> 0:10:17,16
HELEN CHO: What are
you making for us?


310
0:10:17,16 --> 0:10:18,67
ANTHONY BOURDAIN:
It's a surprise.


311
0:10:18,67 --> 0:10:20,28
HELEN CHO: It's a surprise?


312
0:10:20,28 --> 0:10:23,16
ZACH ZAMBONI: Let me guess--
does it involve beef?


313
0:10:23,16 --> 0:10:23,79
Beef surprise.


314
0:10:23,79 --> 0:10:24,68
ANTHONY BOURDAIN: No, no.


315
0:10:24,68 --> 0:10:25,54
HELEN CHO: That sounds boring.


316
0:10:25,54 --> 0:10:26,83
What kind of surprise?


317
0:10:26,83 --> 0:10:27,59
ANTHONY BOURDAIN:
It's a vegetable


318
0:10:27,59 --> 0:10:28,57
medley of locally sourced--


319
0:10:28,57 --> 0:10:29,79
HELEN CHO: Vegetables?


320
0:10:29,79 --> 0:10:30,67
ANTHONY BOURDAIN: Artisanally
produced--


321
0:10:30,67 --> 0:10:33,25
HELEN CHO: Vegetable,
fuck that, man!


322
0:10:33,25 --> 0:10:34,82
You going to break my heart?


323
0:10:34,82 --> 0:10:35,382
ZACH ZAMBONI: Anthony.


324
0:10:35,382 --> 0:10:37,6
HELEN CHO: You going
to make us tofu?


325
0:10:37,6 --> 0:10:39,52
ZACH ZAMBONI: People
will see this.


326
0:10:39,52 --> 0:10:40,4
HELEN CHO: Anthony, right.


327
0:10:40,4 --> 0:10:40,99
Because we always call
him Anthony.


328
0:10:40,99 --> 0:10:42,125
ANTHONY BOURDAIN: It's
a whole new me.


329
0:10:42,125 --> 0:10:44,795
HELEN CHO: Um, hello,
Mr. Anthony.


330
0:10:44,795 --> 0:10:47,83
ANTHONY BOURDAIN: He's back, and
this time, it's for real.


331
0:10:47,83 --> 0:10:52,24



332
0:10:52,24 --> 0:10:55,67
RESTAURANT PATRON
1: Oh my god!


333
0:10:55,67 --> 0:10:58,61
Oh my god!


334
0:10:58,61 --> 0:11:0,958
RESTAURANT PATRON 2: We're
huge fans of your show.


335
0:11:0,958 --> 0:11:1,956
That's why we came here.


336
0:11:1,956 --> 0:11:3,153
RESTAURANT PATRON 3:
You're the best.


337
0:11:3,153 --> 0:11:3,952
I love you.


338
0:11:3,952 --> 0:11:5,324
RESTAURANT PATRON
4: Can we take a


339
0:11:5,324 --> 0:11:6,574
picture with you, please?


340
0:11:6,574 --> 0:11:10,439



341
0:11:10,439 --> 0:11:11,936
RESTAURANT PATRON
5: Hey, man--


342
0:11:11,936 --> 0:11:13,932
ANTHONY BOURDAIN: I've
got to go to work!


343
0:11:13,932 --> 0:11:16,177
RESTAURANT PATRON 5: But I got
engaged to my first wife here,


344
0:11:16,177 --> 0:11:16,427
in this restaurant.


345
0:11:16,427 --> 0:11:17,425
ANTHONY BOURDAIN: Oh, yeah?


346
0:11:17,425 --> 0:11:18,423
RESTAURANT PATRON 5: This is
my soon to be second wife.


347
0:11:18,423 --> 0:11:19,72
ANTHONY BOURDAIN: Well,
I'm sorry about


348
0:11:19,72 --> 0:11:20,419
the first time around.


349
0:11:20,419 --> 0:11:21,417
RESTAURANT PATRON 5:
But it worked out.


350
0:11:21,417 --> 0:11:22,914
RESTAURANT PATRON 6: You
brought me luck.


351
0:11:22,914 --> 0:11:26,407
Thank you.


352
0:11:26,407 --> 0:11:27,657
ANTHONY BOURDAIN:
That was weird.


353
0:11:27,657 --> 0:11:29,93



354
0:11:29,93 --> 0:11:33,56
I was a chef there when Kitchen
Confidential hit, and


355
0:11:33,56 --> 0:11:35,97
Carlos, who worked with
me then, is now


356
0:11:35,97 --> 0:11:37,86
the executive chef.


357
0:11:37,86 --> 0:11:38,41
Carlos!


358
0:11:38,41 --> 0:11:39,15
CARLOS: Chef.


359
0:11:39,15 --> 0:11:40,9
ANTHONY BOURDAIN: How
you doing, brother?


360
0:11:40,9 --> 0:11:44,14
OK, I'd like to throw a couple
of cote du boeuf on the grill.


361
0:11:44,14 --> 0:11:44,88
CARLOS: OK.


362
0:11:44,88 --> 0:11:46,828
ANTHONY BOURDAIN: Cook up some
cote du boeuf for my friends.


363
0:11:46,828 --> 0:11:47,422
Can you trust me with that?


364
0:11:47,422 --> 0:11:48,67
Think I'm good enough?


365
0:11:48,67 --> 0:11:52,276
What's great about Les Halles
is they were completely


366
0:11:52,276 --> 0:11:55,6
unimpressed with me in the
kitchen from the get-go.


367
0:11:55,6 --> 0:11:57,15
Carlos is a good friend,
of course.


368
0:11:57,15 --> 0:11:58,96
Also, he's been on the
show many times.


369
0:11:58,96 --> 0:12:0,82
But I think what they
see first when I


370
0:12:0,82 --> 0:12:1,82
walk into the kitchen--


371
0:12:1,82 --> 0:12:3,89
I think they're all privately
hoping, oh, God, please don't


372
0:12:3,89 --> 0:12:5,42
let him cook.


373
0:12:5,42 --> 0:12:8,5
I'm seen as a liability to the
smooth operations of the


374
0:12:8,5 --> 0:12:10,49
kitchen, not as famoso.


375
0:12:10,49 --> 0:12:13,35
If anything, they bust my balls
somewhat worse than they


376
0:12:13,35 --> 0:12:14,82
did when I was working
on the line.


377
0:12:14,82 --> 0:12:19,275
CARLOS: Don't fuck it up, OK?


378
0:12:19,275 --> 0:12:21,8
ANTHONY BOURDAIN: I don't
get to cook much.


379
0:12:21,8 --> 0:12:24,56
People ask me a lot--
do you miss cooking?


380
0:12:24,56 --> 0:12:27,39
Well, I don't miss standing in
the kitchen for 16 hours a


381
0:12:27,39 --> 0:12:29,12
day, and I'm at an age where
I wouldn't be good at that


382
0:12:29,12 --> 0:12:31,5
anymore, anyway.


383
0:12:31,5 --> 0:12:33,68
You'll get an opportunity
to cook at home.


384
0:12:33,68 --> 0:12:36,16
On the road, I'm eating
most of the time.


385
0:12:36,16 --> 0:12:38,57
So when I get to cook for
my crew, that's a deeply


386
0:12:38,57 --> 0:12:40,14
satisfying thing.


387
0:12:40,14 --> 0:12:41,44
An all too rare thing.


388
0:12:41,44 --> 0:12:43,98
There's a Martha Stewart
side of me, honestly.


389
0:12:43,98 --> 0:12:47,68
Throwing together a little
meal for a few friends--


390
0:12:47,68 --> 0:12:51,14
I like doing it.


391
0:12:51,14 --> 0:12:51,48
What?


392
0:12:51,48 --> 0:12:53,565
HELEN CHO: Are you making
food for us, or what?


393
0:12:53,565 --> 0:12:54,59
ANTHONY BOURDAIN:
I'm making food.


394
0:12:54,59 --> 0:12:55,75
It's going to take some-- look
at that piece of meat.


395
0:12:55,75 --> 0:12:58,43
It's a big fucking piece
of meat, OK?


396
0:12:58,43 --> 0:12:59,826
HELEN CHO: Let me see.


397
0:12:59,826 --> 0:13:1,1
ANTHONY BOURDAIN: It's going
to take some time.


398
0:13:1,1 --> 0:13:1,57
All right.


399
0:13:1,57 --> 0:13:2,51
Could you watch that for
me for a little bit?


400
0:13:2,51 --> 0:13:3,92
CARLOS: Don't worry.


401
0:13:3,92 --> 0:13:4,25
[INAUDIBLE].


402
0:13:4,25 --> 0:13:5,54
ANTHONY BOURDAIN:
As always, yeah.


403
0:13:5,54 --> 0:13:7,655
HELEN CHO: We need to do shots.


404
0:13:7,655 --> 0:13:8,14
Carlos--


405
0:13:8,14 --> 0:13:9,152
Carlos--


406
0:13:9,152 --> 0:13:9,916
shot.


407
0:13:9,916 --> 0:13:10,86
We want a shot.


408
0:13:10,86 --> 0:13:14,636
CARLOS: I'm still working.


409
0:13:14,636 --> 0:13:17,0
ANTHONY BOURDAIN: I'm lame.


410
0:13:17,0 --> 0:13:20,91
I can't even maintain the
illusion that I cook anymore.


411
0:13:20,91 --> 0:13:22,677
I don't even have the energy
for that shit.


412
0:13:22,677 --> 0:13:26,667
CARLOS: We worked for almost
a year and a half.


413
0:13:26,667 --> 0:13:27,601
He's fun, man.


414
0:13:27,601 --> 0:13:29,47
That guy is fucking fun.


415
0:13:29,47 --> 0:13:33,35
He likes hardcore, like
Slipknot, Deftones, Pantera--


416
0:13:33,35 --> 0:13:34,51
all that.


417
0:13:34,51 --> 0:13:37,5
He was a fun guy to work with.


418
0:13:37,5 --> 0:13:39,73
All the other guys like when
they come here, because they


419
0:13:39,73 --> 0:13:41,349
want to be part of the
show, obviously.


420
0:13:41,349 --> 0:13:43,69
He's a big fucking star now.


421
0:13:43,69 --> 0:13:45,33
When he comes around,
people freak out.


422
0:13:45,33 --> 0:13:49,479



423
0:13:49,479 --> 0:13:52,602
ANTHONY BOURDAIN: Here we go.


424
0:13:52,602 --> 0:13:56,775
The difference between him and
me is that he gets pussy off


425
0:13:56,775 --> 0:13:57,512
this fucking show.


426
0:13:57,512 --> 0:13:58,494
I don't.


427
0:13:58,494 --> 0:14:0,949
CARLOS: You know what, I really
thank you for that,


428
0:14:0,949 --> 0:14:4,386
because I've been getting
laid so much.


429
0:14:4,386 --> 0:14:5,859
HELEN CHO: Yeah, Carlos!


430
0:14:5,859 --> 0:14:6,86
ANTHONY BOURDAIN: Me?


431
0:14:6,86 --> 0:14:7,7
No.


432
0:14:7,7 --> 0:14:9,535
CARLOS: Seriously, it's
like Captain Morgan.


433
0:14:9,535 --> 0:14:11,14
I can't even count them.


434
0:14:11,14 --> 0:14:12,986
DIANE SCHUTZ: Aw,
I'm so proud.


435
0:14:12,986 --> 0:14:14,465
HELEN CHO: I know.


436
0:14:14,465 --> 0:14:15,451
We are so proud.


437
0:14:15,451 --> 0:14:16,437
We're so happy for
you, Carlos.


438
0:14:16,437 --> 0:14:17,62
ANTHONY BOURDAIN: Yeah, I'm
flying to Burgundy tomorrow to


439
0:14:17,62 --> 0:14:20,874
make love to Mr. [INAUDIBLE],
and he's getting fucking laid.


440
0:14:20,874 --> 0:14:22,846
Oh, I'm so happy for you.


441
0:14:22,846 --> 0:14:23,74
DIANE SCHUTZ: Wow.


442
0:14:23,74 --> 0:14:25,914
ANTHONY BOURDAIN:
This is amazing.


443
0:14:25,914 --> 0:14:26,816
So happy.


444
0:14:26,816 --> 0:14:27,27
Very good.


445
0:14:27,27 --> 0:14:28,57
You'll notice it's a constant.


446
0:14:28,57 --> 0:14:30,63
Everybody in my life will
get on my show.


447
0:14:30,63 --> 0:14:33,3
Where does reality end
and television begin?


448
0:14:33,3 --> 0:14:35,38
Where does work end
and fun begin?


449
0:14:35,38 --> 0:14:37,4
It's such a permeable line.


450
0:14:37,4 --> 0:14:38,15
I can't tell.


451
0:14:38,15 --> 0:14:43,14
I'm in this very weird place
where I get paid to be myself.


452
0:14:43,14 --> 0:14:44,52
Is this a reality show?


453
0:14:44,52 --> 0:14:46,45
I don't even [INAUDIBLE]


454
0:14:46,45 --> 0:14:48,59
I don't even know
what reality is.


455
0:14:48,59 --> 0:14:51,445
I just know what we do, and it's
a lot of fun, and it's


456
0:14:51,445 --> 0:14:51,65
interesting.


457
0:14:51,65 --> 0:14:53,99
And I work with them.
