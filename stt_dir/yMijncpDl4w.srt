2
0:0:11,616 --> 0:0:15,325
GRADO: I remember when I was
about 12 years old, I used to


3
0:0:15,325 --> 0:0:18,41
speak to these wrestling
on the internet.


4
0:0:18,41 --> 0:0:20,39
And I would tell them that I
was a wrestling journalist.


5
0:0:20,39 --> 0:0:22,14
And say, oh, I'm a Scottish
wrestling journalist.


6
0:0:22,14 --> 0:0:25,44
I'm 30 years old, and give me a
wrestler's phone number, and


7
0:0:25,44 --> 0:0:26,7
I'll phone them.


8
0:0:26,7 --> 0:0:28,56
I would take my pocket money,
right, change it into pound


9
0:0:28,56 --> 0:0:30,72
coins, and go to a phonebox,
and I would phone these


10
0:0:30,72 --> 0:0:31,91
wrestlers in America.


11
0:0:31,91 --> 0:0:35,405
The phone rang, and I was like
hi, this Graeme from Scotland.


12
0:0:35,405 --> 0:0:36,37
I would like to do
an interview with


13
0:0:36,37 --> 0:0:37,203
you, is that OK?


14
0:0:37,203 --> 0:0:40,194
How did you get my
number, bro?


15
0:0:40,194 --> 0:0:41,28
Uh, I'm--


16
0:0:41,28 --> 0:0:41,735
I'm--


17
0:0:41,735 --> 0:0:42,54
a wrestling journalist.


18
0:0:42,54 --> 0:0:43,77
I'm just looking to
get a few words.


19
0:0:43,77 --> 0:0:43,98
Is that OK?


20
0:0:43,98 --> 0:0:44,33
[GRUFF VOICE]


21
0:0:44,33 --> 0:0:46,444
Dude, don't you phone
here again.


22
0:0:46,444 --> 0:0:47,33
How'd you get my number?


23
0:0:47,33 --> 0:0:48,96
I shat myself and hung up.


24
0:0:48,96 --> 0:0:51,45
The reason why I've never ever
been booked on big shows is


25
0:0:51,45 --> 0:0:52,64
because of my physique.


26
0:0:52,64 --> 0:0:55,0
I mean, I've not exactly
got the best


27
0:0:55,0 --> 0:0:56,79
wrestling body there is.


28
0:0:56,79 --> 0:0:58,81
Which kind of annoys me, because
I hate seeing other


29
0:0:58,81 --> 0:1:0,65
wrestlers that look like
a bag of shite.


30
0:1:0,65 --> 0:1:3,715
My first ever training session
was when I was 14 years old,


31
0:1:3,715 --> 0:1:5,43
which was about 10 years
ago this year.


32
0:1:5,43 --> 0:1:6,98
But you would never believe
I've had 10 years


33
0:1:6,98 --> 0:1:8,26
of wrestling training.


34
0:1:8,26 --> 0:1:10,17
If you see me wrestle now, you'd
probably think I've been


35
0:1:10,17 --> 0:1:11,177
wrestling for about
six months, do


36
0:1:11,177 --> 0:1:12,195
you know what I mean?


37
0:1:12,195 --> 0:1:15,77
I would stop wrestling every now
and again, just because I


38
0:1:15,77 --> 0:1:18,91
had a bad match and thought
I've stunk that ring out.


39
0:1:18,91 --> 0:1:20,12
I never want to do that again.


40
0:1:20,12 --> 0:1:21,3
It was embarrassing.


41
0:1:21,3 --> 0:1:23,67
And when I was at school,
obviously, a lot of people


42
0:1:23,67 --> 0:1:25,69
heard that I was training
to be a wrestler.


43
0:1:25,69 --> 0:1:27,55
And there were some people who
thought that was really cool.


44
0:1:27,55 --> 0:1:29,9
But there was always other
folk that thought


45
0:1:29,9 --> 0:1:30,125
that's a lot of shite.


46
0:1:30,125 --> 0:1:31,31
That's fake.


47
0:1:31,31 --> 0:1:32,22
That is gay.


48
0:1:32,22 --> 0:1:33,83
And to be honest with you, you
just keep your head up and


49
0:1:33,83 --> 0:1:35,84
think to yourself, get
yourself to fuck.


50
0:1:35,84 --> 0:1:38,48
All people really need to do is
go on the internet and find


51
0:1:38,48 --> 0:1:41,62
a respectable training school
out there that will train you


52
0:1:41,62 --> 0:1:42,87
to the highest standard.


53
0:1:42,87 --> 0:1:45,35



54
0:1:45,35 --> 0:1:47,16
UK DOMINATOR: My real name
is Dominic Hepburn.


55
0:1:47,16 --> 0:1:49,19
My alias is the UK Dominator.


56
0:1:49,19 --> 0:1:52,3
Now, anybody can get in the
ring, anybody can wrestle.


57
0:1:52,3 --> 0:1:54,1
But that doesn't make
a wrestler, does it?


58
0:1:54,1 --> 0:1:56,84
What makes a wrestle is people
hating you, people loving you.


59
0:1:56,84 --> 0:1:58,15
So face shows, do you
know what I mean?


60
0:1:58,15 --> 0:1:59,54
If you want a really evil look,
it's like you want to


61
0:1:59,54 --> 0:2:2,4
look at somebody, you want to
make them hate you for that


62
0:2:2,4 --> 0:2:3,5
look, or you want to make them
love you for that look.


63
0:2:3,5 --> 0:2:6,61
Because if you go out to a ring
and you don't give the


64
0:2:6,61 --> 0:2:9,21
right persona out there, who's
going to take to me?


65
0:2:9,21 --> 0:2:9,87
Who's going to boo me?


66
0:2:9,87 --> 0:2:10,789
Who's going to really
look at me?


67
0:2:10,789 --> 0:2:11,42
Nobody.


68
0:2:11,42 --> 0:2:14,3
FEMALE SPEAKER: I am one of
the wrestler's mums--


69
0:2:14,3 --> 0:2:15,874
Johnny Sicko.


70
0:2:15,874 --> 0:2:17,65
I'm looking forward to it.


71
0:2:17,65 --> 0:2:19,91
DANGER DAN: I'm PWA trainee
Danger Dan.


72
0:2:19,91 --> 0:2:25,24
And you have entered
the Danger Zone.


73
0:2:25,24 --> 0:2:27,16
That's it.


74
0:2:27,16 --> 0:2:31,96
ANNOUNCER: It's showtime!


75
0:2:31,96 --> 0:2:35,34
[CHEERS]


76
0:2:35,34 --> 0:2:36,86
UK DOMINATOR: Look at
the child, you go,


77
0:2:36,86 --> 0:2:37,43
is this your mum?


78
0:2:37,43 --> 0:2:38,89
Child goes, yeah.


79
0:2:38,89 --> 0:2:40,56
And she's as ugly
as you, mate.


80
0:2:40,56 --> 0:2:43,74
You go on the mic, and you turn
around and you say, I've


81
0:2:43,74 --> 0:2:44,605
wrestled all over the world.


82
0:2:44,605 --> 0:2:48,59
But I've never seen so many fat,
overweight people in one


83
0:2:48,59 --> 0:2:51,662
place at one time.


84
0:2:51,662 --> 0:2:54,506
You, you, you and all you!


85
0:2:54,506 --> 0:2:55,454
Your worst enemy!


86
0:2:55,454 --> 0:2:57,35
Your worst enemy!


87
0:2:57,35 --> 0:2:59,88
You see, I have three rules
before I start wrestling.


88
0:2:59,88 --> 0:3:2,61
The first rule-- when I
tell you to sit down,


89
0:3:2,61 --> 0:3:4,8
you will sit down.


90
0:3:4,8 --> 0:3:4,49
What do they do?


91
0:3:4,49 --> 0:3:5,64
They get up.


92
0:3:5,64 --> 0:3:7,33
MALE SPEAKER: Hammer him!


93
0:3:7,33 --> 0:3:10,4
UK DOMINATOR: Second rule-- when
I tell you to shut up,


94
0:3:10,4 --> 0:3:11,13
you will shut up.


95
0:3:11,13 --> 0:3:12,722
What do they do?


96
0:3:12,722 --> 0:3:13,206
They shout.


97
0:3:13,206 --> 0:3:15,23
MALE SPEAKER: Boo!


98
0:3:15,23 --> 0:3:17,75
UK DOMINATOR: My third
and my final rule--


99
0:3:17,75 --> 0:3:21,9
you will show me respect, the
respect that I deserve.


100
0:3:21,9 --> 0:3:23,93
And if you don't, I don't care
if you're a six-year-old kid,


101
0:3:23,93 --> 0:3:27,15
or I don't care if you're
a 66-year-old old man.


102
0:3:27,15 --> 0:3:30,47
I'll come out of this ring, and
I'll smash every one of


103
0:3:30,47 --> 0:3:31,26
your faces in.


104
0:3:31,26 --> 0:3:34,17
I'll come out of this ring
and smash your faces in!


105
0:3:34,17 --> 0:3:37,25
And by that time, you've got
them shouting, and you've got


106
0:3:37,25 --> 0:3:37,705
them screaming.


107
0:3:37,705 --> 0:3:40,75
And if that don't work, mate,
get out of the business.


108
0:3:40,75 --> 0:3:42,105
It's as simple as that.


109
0:3:42,105 --> 0:3:49,715



110
0:3:49,715 --> 0:3:52,21
DAN WALSH: So I call myself Dan
"The Pretty Boy" Walsh,


111
0:3:52,21 --> 0:3:53,795
all the ladies love
me kind of thing.


112
0:3:53,795 --> 0:3:56,94
Whereas my fitness is probably
not as good as most people, I


113
0:3:56,94 --> 0:3:58,33
make it up with my character.


114
0:3:58,33 --> 0:3:59,98
My character's a lot better
than most people's.


115
0:3:59,98 --> 0:4:2,46
I can go out there and change,
and I'm that guy.


116
0:4:2,46 --> 0:4:4,384
Yeah, baby!


117
0:4:4,384 --> 0:4:7,27
You want some of this
in your mouth, huh?


118
0:4:7,27 --> 0:4:8,713
Get out of my face now.


119
0:4:8,713 --> 0:4:11,807
This one here, he claims
job seeker's allowance.


120
0:4:11,807 --> 0:4:13,298
MALE SPEAKER: Well, then,
I'm a security guard.


121
0:4:13,298 --> 0:4:15,286
And I could beat you up,
you fucking prick.


122
0:4:15,286 --> 0:4:18,268
DAN WALSH: Where I come from,
Kensington, London, we don't


123
0:4:18,268 --> 0:4:22,452
look inbred like each and
every one of you.


124
0:4:22,452 --> 0:4:25,868
You're looking at the
future of WWE.


125
0:4:25,868 --> 0:4:28,632
I'm going to get paid loads of
money, get all the girls to be


126
0:4:28,632 --> 0:4:30,26
kissing some of this.


127
0:4:30,26 --> 0:4:33,676
And then I won't have to see
your faces ever again.


128
0:4:33,676 --> 0:4:35,1
I think I could be
a WWE superstar.


129
0:4:35,1 --> 0:4:36,48
I think I've got the gimmick.


130
0:4:36,48 --> 0:4:40,1
I've got the aura about me,
and I want that lifestyle.


131
0:4:40,1 --> 0:4:43,3
I grew up watching wrestling,
and I was watching them, and I


132
0:4:43,3 --> 0:4:43,81
want to be like them.


133
0:4:43,81 --> 0:4:46,356
And so from the age of like,
say four, I was mesmerized.


134
0:4:46,356 --> 0:4:50,73



135
0:4:50,73 --> 0:4:52,412
Most people say that
you should grow out


136
0:4:52,412 --> 0:4:52,62
of it kind of thing.


137
0:4:52,62 --> 0:4:54,0
But I looked at it more from
the business point of view,


138
0:4:54,0 --> 0:4:55,76
saying I want to do that
to make money.


139
0:4:55,76 --> 0:4:58,4
You know, these guys
are celebrities.


140
0:4:58,4 --> 0:5:0,19
I've always wanted to
be a celebrity.


141
0:5:0,19 --> 0:5:2,7
My whole life I've felt like I'm
never going to fit in to a


142
0:5:2,7 --> 0:5:4,25
normal 9:00 to 5:00 style.


143
0:5:4,25 --> 0:5:8,55
And that's my motivation and
drive to get out of these kind


144
0:5:8,55 --> 0:5:10,14
of shows and get up
to the next stage.


145
0:5:10,14 --> 0:5:11,44
And there's nothing wrong with
them, don't get me wrong.


146
0:5:11,44 --> 0:5:13,39
I've learnt my trade, and I'll
never forget my roots.


147
0:5:13,39 --> 0:5:16,79
But there comes a point when you
turn around and say this


148
0:5:16,79 --> 0:5:17,86
ain't for me anymore.


149
0:5:17,86 --> 0:5:19,305
I don't want to do
the lifestyle


150
0:5:19,305 --> 0:5:20,76
of most normal people.


151
0:5:20,76 --> 0:5:23,31
I want to leave a legacy, that's
what I've always said.


152
0:5:23,31 --> 0:5:26,65
I want to be in books that
people read in 2,000 years,


153
0:5:26,65 --> 0:5:28,895
saying this was a professional
wrestler back in 2000.


154
0:5:28,895 --> 0:5:31,402
You know, that's kind
of cool to me--


155
0:5:31,402 --> 0:5:32,652
hopefully.


156
0:5:32,652 --> 0:5:35,135



157
0:5:35,135 --> 0:5:37,26
I don't know if you've seen
The Wrestler, the movie?


158
0:5:37,26 --> 0:5:39,58
I sometimes feel that's going
to be me if I fail.


159
0:5:39,58 --> 0:5:40,96
And it scares me, mate.


160
0:5:40,96 --> 0:5:42,326
Seeing him living in the
trailer, and doing


161
0:5:42,326 --> 0:5:43,75
drugs kind of thing.


162
0:5:43,75 --> 0:5:46,74
Still living the dream
in a sports hall


163
0:5:46,74 --> 0:5:49,76
with like 20 people.


164
0:5:49,76 --> 0:5:52,83
MALE SPEAKER: I watched The
Wrestler up until maybe


165
0:5:52,83 --> 0:5:54,31
two-thirds of the way through.


166
0:5:54,31 --> 0:5:56,4
I'm just like, yeah,
I can't watch this.


167
0:5:56,4 --> 0:5:57,365
It's kind of awkward.


168
0:5:57,365 --> 0:6:0,26
I'd got the long, blonde hair
at the time and stuff.


169
0:6:0,26 --> 0:6:1,84
And I was in the gym, and
some guy walked in.


170
0:6:1,84 --> 0:6:5,185
He goes, you look like Mickey
Rourke out of The Wrestler.


171
0:6:5,185 --> 0:6:7,51
Should I really take that
as a compliment?


172
0:6:7,51 --> 0:6:11,33
This is a guy who's had a
botched face lift, and you're


173
0:6:11,33 --> 0:6:12,45
telling me I look like him.


174
0:6:12,45 --> 0:6:13,195
It's like, cheers!


175
0:6:13,195 --> 0:6:15,5
It looks like I've
had a stroke on


176
0:6:15,5 --> 0:6:17,88
both sides of my face.


177
0:6:17,88 --> 0:6:22,39
When I was doing 350 shows a
year, me and the persona


178
0:6:22,39 --> 0:6:26,7
starting getting a little bit
blurred at times, and I was a


179
0:6:26,7 --> 0:6:27,6
complete and utter arsehole.


180
0:6:27,6 --> 0:6:29,765
And I can be honest with that,
like, people hated my guts.


181
0:6:29,765 --> 0:6:32,24
When you've talked to the other
guys, they'll probably


182
0:6:32,24 --> 0:6:35,78
say a similar thing like the
wrestler is just an extension


183
0:6:35,78 --> 0:6:38,133
of their personality.


184
0:6:38,133 --> 0:6:40,2
Well, obviously, I'm
not a transvestite.


185
0:6:40,2 --> 0:6:43,114



186
0:6:43,114 --> 0:6:45,5
GRADO: I want some of this
promo on the beach.


187
0:6:45,5 --> 0:6:46,6
This is my pal Jordan.


188
0:6:46,6 --> 0:6:47,21
JORDAN: Hi.


189
0:6:47,21 --> 0:6:50,44
GRADO: He films all my promos
and edits them and puts them


190
0:6:50,44 --> 0:6:52,165
together before I put
them on YouTube.


191
0:6:52,165 --> 0:6:55,69
JORDAN: I just use my camera
phone and some software we got


192
0:6:55,69 --> 0:6:56,92
for free on the internet.


193
0:6:56,92 --> 0:6:59,894
GRADO: So get the fucking
phone out and film me.


194
0:6:59,894 --> 0:7:1,3
It's yourself!


195
0:7:1,3 --> 0:7:1,78
Sports--


196
0:7:1,78 --> 0:7:2,865
sport-- blah, la, la.


197
0:7:2,865 --> 0:7:4,412
Just keep going.


198
0:7:4,412 --> 0:7:6,77
Maybe with my bumbag as
if it's like my belt.


199
0:7:6,77 --> 0:7:7,552
JORDAN: A belt?


200
0:7:7,552 --> 0:7:7,71
Aye.


201
0:7:7,71 --> 0:7:8,18
GRADO: Aye.


202
0:7:8,18 --> 0:7:10,27
You remember when you were a
wean, and you wanted to grow


203
0:7:10,27 --> 0:7:12,565
up and be the biggest sports
star in the world?


204
0:7:12,565 --> 0:7:15,63
Boxing fans would grow up as
fanatics, wanting to fight for


205
0:7:15,63 --> 0:7:18,3
the heavyweight title in
Las Vegas, Nevada?


206
0:7:18,3 --> 0:7:20,5
Tennis, you wanted to verse
every cunt in Wimbledon?


207
0:7:20,5 --> 0:7:21,6
I'm telling you.


208
0:7:21,6 --> 0:7:21,5
JORDAN: You can't say cunt.


209
0:7:21,5 --> 0:7:22,2
It's a PG thing.


210
0:7:22,2 --> 0:7:24,33
GRADO: Oh, PG, fuck.


211
0:7:24,33 --> 0:7:35,51



212
0:7:35,51 --> 0:7:36,926
That do?


213
0:7:36,926 --> 0:7:38,885
JORDAN: Obviously, it looks
better with music over the top


214
0:7:38,885 --> 0:7:39,49
of it and edit it.


215
0:7:39,49 --> 0:7:42,12
GRADO: All right, once we get
music in, it will look better.


216
0:7:42,12 --> 0:7:43,37
Fuck, I'm cunted.


217
0:7:43,37 --> 0:7:46,37



218
0:7:46,37 --> 0:7:49,32
There's a speedboat.


219
0:7:49,32 --> 0:7:50,66
It's yourself!


220
0:7:50,66 --> 0:7:52,91
I didn't really decide to
make it my catchphrase.


221
0:7:52,91 --> 0:7:54,515
People just kind of
clicked onto it.


222
0:7:54,515 --> 0:7:56,62
It's just a kind of quick way
of saying, it's yourself.


223
0:7:56,62 --> 0:7:58,92
How are you doing?


224
0:7:58,92 --> 0:7:59,37
Hi!


225
0:7:59,37 --> 0:8:0,37
There's old Jeanie.


226
0:8:0,37 --> 0:8:1,635
It's yourself, old Jeanie.


227
0:8:1,635 --> 0:8:2,17
How are you doing?


228
0:8:2,17 --> 0:8:5,57
I don't know when I shout it's
yourself, it's just like


229
0:8:5,57 --> 0:8:6,91
something that they can
relate to Grado.


230
0:8:6,91 --> 0:8:11,54
It's just like The Rock, where
The Rock says if you smell


231
0:8:11,54 --> 0:8:12,56
what The Rock's cooking.


232
0:8:12,56 --> 0:8:18,47
ANNOUNCER: If you smell what
The Rock is cooking!


233
0:8:18,47 --> 0:8:21,72
GRADO: It doesn't actually
mean The Rock is actually


234
0:8:21,72 --> 0:8:22,56
making something for
you to smell it,


235
0:8:22,56 --> 0:8:23,58
you know what I mean?


236
0:8:23,58 --> 0:8:24,58
It's just he's saying it.


237
0:8:24,58 --> 0:8:26,5
It's just his catchphrase.


238
0:8:26,5 --> 0:8:27,8
It's just like me.


239
0:8:27,8 --> 0:8:28,33
It's yourself!


240
0:8:28,33 --> 0:8:31,454



241
0:8:31,454 --> 0:8:34,856
ANNOUNCER: Good evening
Sudbury!


242
0:8:34,856 --> 0:8:39,716
Welcome to Pro Wrestling Eve!


243
0:8:39,716 --> 0:8:43,15



244
0:8:43,15 --> 0:8:46,92
Before we start I just need
to check one thing.


245
0:8:46,92 --> 0:8:49,36
And that's are you ready?


246
0:8:49,36 --> 0:8:51,304
[CHEERS]


247
0:8:51,304 --> 0:8:54,4
HANNAH: First time ever in
wrestling history, twins


248
0:8:54,4 --> 0:8:54,71
versus twins.


249
0:8:54,71 --> 0:8:56,667
It's Blossoms versus
the Owens.


250
0:8:56,667 --> 0:8:59,102
Obviously, they have all the
cool twin poses and stuff.


251
0:8:59,102 --> 0:9:2,51
We like baking and cupcakes
and British things.


252
0:9:2,51 --> 0:9:2,87
Hanna, Holly.


253
0:9:2,87 --> 0:9:3,67
HOLLY: Yes.


254
0:9:3,67 --> 0:9:4,855
HANNAH: The Blossom Twins.


255
0:9:4,855 --> 0:9:5,67
HOLLY: Yes.


256
0:9:5,67 --> 0:9:8,12
HANNAH: We spent five years
around the UK, and we've just


257
0:9:8,12 --> 0:9:9,85
come back from two years in
America, in Kentucky.


258
0:9:9,85 --> 0:9:12,3
MALE SPEAKER: Whoa, you're
tagging with the Blossoms?


259
0:9:12,3 --> 0:9:13,39
MALE SPEAKER: You better
believe that I am.


260
0:9:13,39 --> 0:9:15,21
MALE SPEAKER: Hey,
I want a cupcake.


261
0:9:15,21 --> 0:9:15,8
MALE SPEAKER: Get away!


262
0:9:15,8 --> 0:9:17,33
That's for Team Cupcake only.


263
0:9:17,33 --> 0:9:18,9
And tonight, that's us.


264
0:9:18,9 --> 0:9:20,21
Ain't that right, ladies?


265
0:9:20,21 --> 0:9:20,72
HOLLY: Yes.


266
0:9:20,72 --> 0:9:21,11
MALE SPEAKER: What do
you say we go get


267
0:9:21,11 --> 0:9:21,71
ready for this match?


268
0:9:21,71 --> 0:9:22,24
What do you say?


269
0:9:22,24 --> 0:9:23,224
Woohoo!


270
0:9:23,224 --> 0:9:25,684
HANNAH: We've had a few
different outfits.


271
0:9:25,684 --> 0:9:28,415
I think when we went over to
America we decided it would be


272
0:9:28,415 --> 0:9:29,99
fun to sort of do more
of the British thing.


273
0:9:29,99 --> 0:9:32,25
I know people are going to tell
you're British as soon as


274
0:9:32,25 --> 0:9:33,73
you open your mouth, but it was
just something as a way of


275
0:9:33,73 --> 0:9:35,88
saying this is where I'm
from and this is us.


276
0:9:35,88 --> 0:9:36,97
HOLLY: First time rocking
this gear.


277
0:9:36,97 --> 0:9:40,44
HANNAH: New for this show.


278
0:9:40,44 --> 0:9:43,644
MALE SPEAKER: Touch me, and I'll
punch you in the face,


279
0:9:43,644 --> 0:9:44,463
you dirty old git.


280
0:9:44,463 --> 0:9:44,954
MALE SPEAKER: Dick!


281
0:9:44,954 --> 0:9:45,936
MALE SPEAKER: What?


282
0:9:45,936 --> 0:9:46,918
What?


283
0:9:46,918 --> 0:9:47,9
MALE SPEAKER: Rubbish.


284
0:9:47,9 --> 0:9:48,391
MALE SPEAKER: What?


285
0:9:48,391 --> 0:9:49,373
FEMALE SPEAKER: Go home!


286
0:9:49,373 --> 0:9:50,355
Go home!


287
0:9:50,355 --> 0:9:50,846
Go home!


288
0:9:50,846 --> 0:9:52,81
FEMALE SPEAKER: Fuck off!


289
0:9:52,81 --> 0:9:55,265
MALE SPEAKER: Rockstar!


290
0:9:55,265 --> 0:9:56,738
FEMALE SPEAKER: Go home!


291
0:9:56,738 --> 0:9:58,211
MALE SPEAKER: You suck!


292
0:9:58,211 --> 0:10:1,157
MALE SPEAKER: Nice
clothes, nob.


293
0:10:1,157 --> 0:10:4,466
If you were that important, the
audience would be facing


294
0:10:4,466 --> 0:10:5,716
you, you ugly nob!


295
0:10:5,716 --> 0:10:8,246



296
0:10:8,246 --> 0:10:10,29
MALE SPEAKER: Wrestling fans are
probably the most unique


297
0:10:10,29 --> 0:10:11,2
fans in the world.


298
0:10:11,2 --> 0:10:13,98
There's no question about it.


299
0:10:13,98 --> 0:10:15,42
MALE SPEAKER: Come
on, wrestle!


300
0:10:15,42 --> 0:10:21,66



301
0:10:21,66 --> 0:10:24,4
MALE SPEAKER: It's what I
call a physical theatre.


302
0:10:24,4 --> 0:10:25,36
That is, a performance sport.


303
0:10:25,36 --> 0:10:29,16
It is entertaining through the
medium of getting hurt almost.


304
0:10:29,16 --> 0:10:40,522



305
0:10:40,522 --> 0:10:42,425
MALE SPEAKER: That's what I
love about professional


306
0:10:42,425 --> 0:10:43,32
wrestling, you know?


307
0:10:43,32 --> 0:10:45,935
Because this is going back to
the days of Shakespeare when


308
0:10:45,935 --> 0:10:47,42
people would come
and see this.


309
0:10:47,42 --> 0:10:49,91
We just hit people with
car doors instead.


310
0:10:49,91 --> 0:10:52,41
FEMALE SPEAKER: You want the
fucking outcome, ref?


311
0:10:52,41 --> 0:10:56,91



312
0:10:56,91 --> 0:10:58,56
GRADO: When I was younger, there
used to be a promotion


313
0:10:58,56 --> 0:11:1,16
that came to Irvine, which
was along the road.


314
0:11:1,16 --> 0:11:2,98
And there was a woman wrestler
on that show


315
0:11:2,98 --> 0:11:4,8
called Klondyke Kate.


316
0:11:4,8 --> 0:11:7,54
And I tell you, she was probably
ten times scarier


317
0:11:7,54 --> 0:11:9,12
than any of the men wrestlers
that were there.


318
0:11:9,12 --> 0:11:12,99
And I remember I was watching
the wrestling in the crowd


319
0:11:12,99 --> 0:11:15,345
with my friends and had
a bag of popcorn.


320
0:11:15,345 --> 0:11:17,65
And I took one bite of
popcorn and launched


321
0:11:17,65 --> 0:11:19,8
it at Klondyke Kate.


322
0:11:19,8 --> 0:11:21,59
And the look she gave me
haunted me for years.


323
0:11:21,59 --> 0:11:22,88
HANNAH: We're teaching
assistants,


324
0:11:22,88 --> 0:11:24,305
we're nursery nurses.


325
0:11:24,305 --> 0:11:26,29
But it's the contrast at first
when people think oh, you're


326
0:11:26,29 --> 0:11:27,365
sweet and you're cute.


327
0:11:27,365 --> 0:11:29,82
And then you go and wrestle and
it's like-- but their kids


328
0:11:29,82 --> 0:11:30,56
absolutely love it.


329
0:11:30,56 --> 0:11:33,2
And for the kids at school who
go, my teacher's a wrestler.


330
0:11:33,2 --> 0:11:34,439
It's kind of fun for them.


331
0:11:34,439 --> 0:11:38,696



332
0:11:38,696 --> 0:11:39,98
MALE SPEAKER: Heartbreak
Twins.


333
0:11:39,98 --> 0:11:41,595
That's what they need
to be called.


334
0:11:41,595 --> 0:11:42,94
They're lovely, aren't they?


335
0:11:42,94 --> 0:11:53,31



336
0:11:53,31 --> 0:11:55,62
GRADO: This is Molly, she's
my biggest supporter.


337
0:11:55,62 --> 0:11:57,84
She watches all my matches.


338
0:11:57,84 --> 0:11:59,55
She's got all my DVDs.


339
0:11:59,55 --> 0:12:1,6
My dog, she's the biggest fan.


340
0:12:1,6 --> 0:12:2,55
Aren't you, hun?


341
0:12:2,55 --> 0:12:3,55
My hands are stinking, man.


342
0:12:3,55 --> 0:12:5,32
I thought I used to get
called Grado in


343
0:12:5,32 --> 0:12:6,46
primary school, right?


344
0:12:6,46 --> 0:12:8,605
And then I never, ever
get called it


345
0:12:8,605 --> 0:12:9,56
through secondary school.


346
0:12:9,56 --> 0:12:12,25
Then I went on a boy's holiday
to Magaluf one year.


347
0:12:12,25 --> 0:12:15,33
And on the last night, me and my
best mate ended up getting


348
0:12:15,33 --> 0:12:16,43
chucked out of the hotel.


349
0:12:16,43 --> 0:12:19,17
So we thought, come on, we'll
go and get tattoos.


350
0:12:19,17 --> 0:12:21,39
So when I went to the tattoo
parlor, I said


351
0:12:21,39 --> 0:12:23,3
put Grado on my arm.


352
0:12:23,3 --> 0:12:23,6
Put Grado on my arm.


353
0:12:23,6 --> 0:12:26,6
The next morning I woke up,
I couldn't believe it.


354
0:12:26,6 --> 0:12:27,5
I tried to scratch it off.


355
0:12:27,5 --> 0:12:29,12
I thought, nobody even
calls me Grado.


356
0:12:29,12 --> 0:12:32,13
There's nothing worse than
somebody having a name


357
0:12:32,13 --> 0:12:34,77
tattooed on their arm that
nobody even calls them.


358
0:12:34,77 --> 0:12:37,185
So I was telling everybody,
you better start


359
0:12:37,185 --> 0:12:37,96
calling me Grado now.


360
0:12:37,96 --> 0:12:39,5
And it just kind of clicked
on and everybody


361
0:12:39,5 --> 0:12:40,38
kind of calls Grado.


362
0:12:40,38 --> 0:12:41,67
And it's just worked its
way into my wrestling


363
0:12:41,67 --> 0:12:42,54
character as well.


364
0:12:42,54 --> 0:12:45,54
So a stupid night in Magaluf
getting a daft tattoo's


365
0:12:45,54 --> 0:12:47,0
actually worked out
quite well for me.


366
0:12:47,0 --> 0:12:50,56
FEMALE SPEAKER: My son has been
into wrestling since ever


367
0:12:50,56 --> 0:12:51,45
I can remember.


368
0:12:51,45 --> 0:12:54,21
Just recently we went
to the Civic Centre.


369
0:12:54,21 --> 0:12:58,34
We went to that and it was a
good night although I wasn't


370
0:12:58,34 --> 0:13:1,14
too pleased because he got a
chair over his head and he


371
0:13:1,14 --> 0:13:4,3
ended in A&E.


372
0:13:4,3 --> 0:13:7,538
GRADO: Somehow I managed to
hit him with my finishing


373
0:13:7,538 --> 0:13:9,71
maneuver, "the Wee Boot."
We started trending.


374
0:13:9,71 --> 0:13:12,3
With the click of a button,
three towns wide, we starting


375
0:13:12,3 --> 0:13:17,47
trending hashtag, Wee Boots to
Asses, Wee Boots to Asses.


376
0:13:17,47 --> 0:13:19,59
FEMALE SPEAKER: He's just
always been like that.


377
0:13:19,59 --> 0:13:21,97
We've always said he's going
to be on the stage one day.


378
0:13:21,97 --> 0:13:24,75
So there he is, he has to
get his own wee stage.


379
0:13:24,75 --> 0:13:26,6
GRADO: Just getting my gear.


380
0:13:26,6 --> 0:13:28,7
That's my wrestling singlet.


381
0:13:28,7 --> 0:13:30,87
I've got my toothbrush in there
as well, because there's


382
0:13:30,87 --> 0:13:32,74
nothing worse than wrestling
somebody with bad breath.


383
0:13:32,74 --> 0:13:34,8
And I've got my deodorant
as well.


384
0:13:34,8 --> 0:13:35,33
Aye, spray and all.


385
0:13:35,33 --> 0:13:36,11
There's nothing worse.


386
0:13:36,11 --> 0:13:37,9
That's one of the reasons you
don't like it and all, because


387
0:13:37,9 --> 0:13:38,8
sometimes you can smell
the wrestlers, man.


388
0:13:38,8 --> 0:13:41,43
Some of them are stinking
men, honestly.


389
0:13:41,43 --> 0:13:43,66
Some of them you just want
to say get a wash.


390
0:13:43,66 --> 0:13:43,94
FEMALE SPEAKER: Exactly.


391
0:13:43,94 --> 0:13:46,27
GRADO: Honestly, some of the
hygiene in British wrestling


392
0:13:46,27 --> 0:13:47,44
man, gives you the boke.


393
0:13:47,44 --> 0:13:48,315
Let's do this!


394
0:13:48,315 --> 0:13:49,16
Come on!


395
0:13:49,16 --> 0:13:50,32
MALE SPEAKER: Go Grado!


396
0:13:50,32 --> 0:13:50,904
