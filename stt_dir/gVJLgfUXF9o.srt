Jenny: Hi I'm Jenny from the Missouri Star
Quilt Company and I'm here with Vanessa Christenson


2
0:0:12,36 --> 0:0:13,11
Vanessa: Hi!


3
0:0:13,11 --> 0:0:18,44
J: and we at the Missouri Star Quilt Company
went on the road and we came to Iowa to meet


4
0:0:18,44 --> 0:0:23,51
Vanessa. We're here in her kitchen, this is
so much fun! Vanessa has a wonderful blog


5
0:0:23,51 --> 0:0:27,6
called V & Co. Is that right?


6
0:0:27,6 --> 0:0:28,66
V: Mmhmm


7
0:0:28,66 --> 0:0:33,979
J: Jacob happened to go on the blog one day
and see this awesome pleated pillow and wanted


8
0:0:33,979 --> 0:0:37,53
to reproduce that. So tell us about how you
came up with this.


9
0:0:37,53 --> 0:0:43,8
V: Well as you know, I have three boys before
I have my little girl and it's really easy


10
0:0:43,8 --> 0:0:48,999
to sew ruffles and whatever for little girls.
So my boys always feel like they get jipped


11
0:0:48,999 --> 0:0:54,639
out of getting things made for them. So, I
tried to come up with something that was still


12
0:0:54,639 --> 0:0:59,85
along the lines of what I really like, which
is texture, and something more manly. So,


13
0:0:59,85 --> 0:1:3,1
I figured pleating would probably be the best
thing to do.


14
0:1:3,1 --> 0:1:4,25
J: It's a great idea.


15
0:1:4,25 --> 0:1:11,33
V: and I came up with using this the Silent
Film by Kona Solids and it's just a Jelly


16
0:1:11,33 --> 0:1:17,89
Roll. It's actually not even using a full
Jelly Roll. So, you can actually make multiple


17
0:1:17,89 --> 0:1:19,1
pillows just from one Jelly Roll.


18
0:1:19,1 --> 0:1:22,3
J: Did you tell me or I read somewhere that
you can make three of them?


19
0:1:22,3 --> 0:1:22,39
V: Yes.


20
0:1:22,39 --> 0:1:24,29
J: From a Jelly Roll. That's awesome! Three
pillows!


21
0:1:24,29 --> 0:1:24,87
V: Yes.


22
0:1:24,87 --> 0:1:30,8
J: Let's show a couple of other ones that
we put together. We've got down here, we've


23
0:1:30,8 --> 0:1:36,31
got this cute little one that we did with
patterns and some grays and whites. It's really


24
0:1:36,31 --> 0:1:41,42
cute. Then this one is just a kaleidoscope
of colors.


25
0:1:41,42 --> 0:1:48,11
V: Yeah, actually on my Flickr group there's
been a lot of people showing, just using all


26
0:1:48,11 --> 0:1:53,21
different colors of fabrics. It's amazing
what one idea,


27
0:1:53,21 --> 0:1:53,73
J: Oh that's so fun!


28
0:1:53,73 --> 0:1:56,87
V: when you use different colorways it turns
out really cool.


29
0:1:56,87 --> 0:2:0,3
J: So, what you're going to need to make this
pillow is, you're going to need a piece of


30
0:2:0,3 --> 0:2:6,83
background fabric. I cut mine to 18”x20”
but really these pillows can be made any size


31
0:2:6,83 --> 0:2:12,76
you want. It's really a scrap, a fat quarter,
any size you want to do. Actually, a fat quarter


32
0:2:12,76 --> 0:2:15,54
is the perfect size because that's about the
right size isn't it.


33
0:2:15,54 --> 0:2:15,689
V:Yup.


34
0:2:15,689 --> 0:2:19,599
J: You'll need a jelly roll. You're gonna
need a ruler and a pen. We're using these


35
0:2:19,599 --> 0:2:23,879
friXion pens because if you make a mistake
with your lines like I did yesterday you can


36
0:2:23,879 --> 0:2:31,349
just quickly iron them off. You'll also need
a scissor and a rotary cutter so that you


37
0:2:31,349 --> 0:2:35,819
can cut your, well, our strips are cut, but
you'll cut the ends of them and trim up the


38
0:2:35,819 --> 0:2:36,49
sides.


39
0:2:36,49 --> 0:2:40,599
So, we're going to open up this Jelly Roll
and I most of you who know me know that color


40
0:2:40,599 --> 0:2:45,599
I am not very good at picking colors so I
let a designer do that. Hence we got her!


41
0:2:45,599 --> 0:2:48,219
She's good at color so she's gonna go through
this.


42
0:2:48,219 --> 0:2:53,609
This is one of those Bella Solids Warm Jelly
Roll it's called. She's gonna go through and


43
0:2:53,609 --> 0:2:54,849
pick some colors that she likes.


44
0:2:54,849 --> 0:3:3,1
V: I just think that the blue and the green
look so beautiful together and if we do maybe


45
0:3:3,1 --> 0:3:4,98
the white along with it.


46
0:3:4,98 --> 0:3:6,529
J: Oh gosh, that is gonna be pretty.


47
0:3:6,529 --> 0:3:9,37
V: I think it reminds me of the beach.


48
0:3:9,37 --> 0:3:11,12
J: Yeah, that's gonna be really pretty.


49
0:3:11,12 --> 0:3:20,81
V: So, I think if we use the blues, greens,
and whites in that. If we need more strips


50
0:3:20,81 --> 0:3:25,349
then we can always add a little bit of a splash
of color as well, but I think.


51
0:3:25,349 --> 0:3:29,469
J: there's a couple more blues and greens
in there too. It's hiding.


52
0:3:29,469 --> 0:3:30,34
V: Perfect.


53
0:3:30,34 --> 0:3:33,4
J: It doesn't take really very many.


54
0:3:33,4 --> 0:3:39,639
V: No, you only need three strips for the
pillow that I have on my website. You only


55
0:3:39,639 --> 0:3:51,209
need three strips of each colorway, and you'll
need five, let's see. One, two, three, four,


56
0:3:51,209 --> 0:3:56,799
five different colors, but if we're doing,
let's say, three colors then you would just


57
0:3:56,799 --> 0:4:3,569
need more strips of each color. So, I think
that would look really beautiful.


58
0:4:3,569 --> 0:4:8,699
J: That is going to be really pretty. It's
so nice to have somebody make that choice


59
0:4:8,699 --> 0:4:16,95
for me! OK so, we have to get this cloth ready
to do it. So what is it we're going to do


60
0:4:16,95 --> 0:4:17,19
here.


61
0:4:17,19 --> 0:4:22,44
V: OK so, I started off with drawing lines.
The first one, the bottom one is going to


62
0:4:22,44 --> 0:4:26,4
be 1 ¼” from the bottom edge.


63
0:4:26,4 --> 0:4:36,48
So, draw your line, your first one 1 ¼”
up. Now to overlap your pleats and so that


64
0:4:36,48 --> 0:4:45,88
it doesn't show your sewing, your stitch.
You'll want to only go ¾ of aline up from


65
0:4:45,88 --> 0:4:46,39
your first.


66
0:4:46,39 --> 0:4:51,29
J: Oh, OK, so the first one is 1 ¼” and
from then on we are going to do ¾”.


67
0:4:51,29 --> 0:4:52,31
V: Yeah.


68
0:4:52,31 --> 0:5:5,97
J: OK, let me see here. Get that all nice
and straight there we go. I love these FriXion


69
0:5:5,97 --> 0:5:12,19
pens I was trying to get one ready to do and
I read the 1 ¼” and so I marked the whole


70
0:5:12,19 --> 0:5:17,92
thing 1 ¼” and it wasn't what I was supposed
to do but because this pen when you use it


71
0:5:17,92 --> 0:5:25,19
you can just, it's removable with heat, and
so you can just erase that with an iron. So,


72
0:5:25,19 --> 0:5:27,1
I was very fortunate with that.


73
0:5:27,1 --> 0:5:30,28
V: Yeah I'm really excited to use that pen!
*laughter*


74
0:5:30,28 --> 0:5:34,65
J: I think every two year old should have
one of these pens so that when they color


75
0:5:34,65 --> 0:5:39,78
on the walls you can just *laughter* iron
them off or blow dry them off! The heat takes


76
0:5:39,78 --> 0:5:40,2
it off!


77
0:5:40,2 --> 0:5:41,12
V: That'll be great.


78
0:5:41,12 --> 0:5:48,42
J: It's very, very fun! OK, so, then what
you do is, you just want to do ¾” lines


79
0:5:48,42 --> 0:5:53,77
all the way up till you get to the top of
your fabric. Whatever size it is you just


80
0:5:53,77 --> 0:5:57,99
need those ¾” lines. So, I'll keep doing
that and we'll get back to you in just a sec.


81
0:5:57,99 --> 0:6:5,56
OK, so now I've drawn all my lines on here
and I'm up to the very last one, and it looks


82
0:6:5,56 --> 0:6:7,61
like I have about ¼” left. Is that right?


83
0:6:7,61 --> 0:6:13,85
V: Yes, because when you do your seam then
you'll actually not grab the last pleat


84
0:6:13,85 --> 0:6:22,22
J: Perfect! Alright, so now here's what this
looks like. See, I have my lines drawn on


85
0:6:22,22 --> 0:6:26,31
and that is what we're going to lay these
pleats on. Correct.


86
0:6:26,31 --> 0:6:33,0
V: Yes, So, I've separated these into five
colors. So, and you can't actually really


87
0:6:33,0 --> 0:6:36,46
tell that there's to much of a difference
but there really is. I think that will be


88
0:6:36,46 --> 0:6:42,61
a very beautiful subtle change in color to
the very last one. It really reminds me of


89
0:6:42,61 --> 0:6:45,85
sea grass. What I'm going to do is I'm going
to take scissors.


90
0:6:45,85 --> 0:6:46,24
J: Uh huh.


91
0:6:46,24 --> 0:6:53,31
V: I'm just going to really easily, the line
is already there, cut it and each strip will


92
0:6:53,31 --> 0:6:54,86
make two pleats.


93
0:6:54,86 --> 0:6:56,94
J: OK, then you want me to?


94
0:6:56,94 --> 0:6:59,29
V: Go ahead and fold it in half lengthwise.


95
0:6:59,29 --> 0:7:1,14
J: OK, and iron it.


96
0:7:1,14 --> 0:7:2,59
V: Uh huh.


97
0:7:2,59 --> 0:7:3,56
J: Alright.


98
0:7:3,56 --> 0:7:5,75
V: And we'll do that to all of these strips.


99
0:7:5,75 --> 0:7:11,14
J: OK, so will you cut and I will iron. There
we go.


100
0:7:11,14 --> 0:7:16,72
V: As a matter of fact, can you just come
and hang out with me every so often.


101
0:7:16,72 --> 0:7:19,74
J: I know! I was just thinking that! It's
so nice to have a cutter.


102
0:7:19,74 --> 0:7:25,23
V: It's really nice to have someone else do
the other part of it! So, we'll just go through


103
0:7:25,23 --> 0:7:33,56
each individual strip. Each individual strip
becomes a pleat when you fold it in half and


104
0:7:33,56 --> 0:7:42,2
iron it. While she's ironing I'll show you,
this is your bottom right here. Your bottom


105
0:7:42,2 --> 0:7:47,49
is the 1 ¼” and the top is just the ¼”,
the leftover on the top.


106
0:7:47,49 --> 0:7:54,25
So, what we're going to do is, we're going
to start off by placing your first strip,


107
0:7:54,25 --> 0:8:2,31
just right up to your drawn on line. We've
already ironed all of them up and so now we


108
0:8:2,31 --> 0:8:6,6
need to decide how we want them to lay on
the pillow.


109
0:8:6,6 --> 0:8:10,83
I think a really good way of doing it, kind
of like the other one that I had done, is


110
0:8:10,83 --> 0:8:16,92
go from the darker on the bottom and go, lead
up to the lighter. So, if you can see this,


111
0:8:16,92 --> 0:8:21,76
there's actually just a slight variation in
these two greens, and then there's a slight


112
0:8:21,76 --> 0:8:30,35
variation on these two kind of like aqua-y
blue. Then we'll lead up to the white.


113
0:8:30,35 --> 0:8:31,69
J: The cream.


114
0:8:31,69 --> 0:8:33,11
V: The cream sorry


115
0:8:33,11 --> 0:8:34,37
J: *giggles*


116
0:8:34,37 --> 0:8:39,31
V: Cream. I don't think this is that one I
think it goes there. OK, so I'm going to start


117
0:8:39,31 --> 0:8:47,279
off first with this kind of bluish aqua, sea
glassy looking one, and we're going to do


118
0:8:47,279 --> 0:8:48,45
the five of them.


119
0:8:48,45 --> 0:8:50,98
J: OK, so we'll have one left?


120
0:8:50,98 --> 0:8:59,2
V: *counting* Yes, we have one left always.
Wow, sorry about that. OK so we're going to


121
0:8:59,2 --> 0:9:5,84
do five and then the next group we're going
to do the same color but then we'll go with


122
0:9:5,84 --> 0:9:13,1
the lighter shade. Then what I think would
be fun to do is the darker color of the green,


123
0:9:13,1 --> 0:9:18,27
right here, and then we'll go with the lighter
green and next. I think that's going to look


124
0:9:18,27 --> 0:9:23,89
really pretty. Then we'll end with the cream
on the top. You think that's?


125
0:9:23,89 --> 0:9:25,45
J: I think that's going to be beautiful!


126
0:9:25,45 --> 0:9:34,36
V: I think that'll be pretty. OK, so let's
go and start with, keep these separated. We've


127
0:9:34,36 --> 0:9:39,15
cut six but we only need five so if you don't
mind grabbing one from each pile.


128
0:9:39,15 --> 0:9:40,13
J: Oh, I don't


129
0:9:40,13 --> 0:9:41,11
V: That'll be great.


130
0:9:41,11 --> 0:9:44,34
J: OK, so we'll sew these on and we'll see
you back here.


131
0:9:44,34 --> 0:9:52,13
V: Alright, so, we've sewn on our first strip.
Now for the second strip, we're going to line


132
0:9:52,13 --> 0:10:3,63
it up again to the next line. Again, it's
longer but there is no salvage on this one


133
0:10:3,63 --> 0:10:7,33
so it really doesn't matter where you start
on that one. I just want it to kind of butt


134
0:10:7,33 --> 0:10:8,75
up against the first.


135
0:10:8,75 --> 0:10:26,1
So, I've set it up that we're going to do
the next one and we're going to do ¼”.


136
0:10:26,1 --> 0:10:39,48
I just always guide the strip as I move along.
So that I make sure it's up next to the line.


137
0:10:39,48 --> 0:10:45,96
J: And you use five strips of each color to
get this look.


138
0:10:45,96 --> 0:10:46,43
V: Yes


139
0:10:46,43 --> 0:10:51,46
J: That's so fun. Really you can do anything.
It's up to your...


140
0:10:51,46 --> 0:10:51,46
V: taste.


141
0:10:51,46 --> 0:10:56,2
J: Yeah, your taste and your artistic, leeway.


142
0:10:56,2 --> 0:11:5,67
V: You can do all one solid color. You can
do all different patterned fabrics. I tend


143
0:11:5,67 --> 0:11:13,7
to be much more on the simplistic side of
things. So, I always tend to play more with


144
0:11:13,7 --> 0:11:19,0
color than I do with pattern, but pattern
is a lot of fun. It'd be a great thing to


145
0:11:19,0 --> 0:11:24,18
use a pattern that ties the colors on your
front for the back.


146
0:11:24,18 --> 0:11:30,589
J: Oh that's a great idea.


147
0:11:30,589 --> 0:11:48,8
V: There we have the next one just done. So,
that's your ¼” seam. Versus the just kind


148
0:11:48,8 --> 0:11:55,36
of closer to the edge. Really there's no big
difference, I just like to do it closer to


149
0:11:55,36 --> 0:12:0,91
the edge. Now we're going to continue to do
all of the rest of the strips. At least these


150
0:12:0,91 --> 0:12:4,66
next five ones. We'll move to the next color
after that.


151
0:12:4,66 --> 0:12:9,92
J: OK, so, we've finished sewing on all these
pleats and it's beautiful, but I'm just not


152
0:12:9,92 --> 0:12:11,16
sure about this right here.


153
0:12:11,16 --> 0:12:15,3
V: Yeah, I'm having a little bit of a hard
time with the cream. I don't really think


154
0:12:15,3 --> 0:12:22,37
it flows with the rest of the pillow. So,
I think what we've decided is that we're going


155
0:12:22,37 --> 0:12:27,85
to not use the white and we're going to actually
end the pillow with the top green. With the


156
0:12:27,85 --> 0:12:32,3
light green that we have on the top. So what
we've already done is we've cut off...


157
0:12:32,3 --> 0:12:36,2
J: The rest of the pillow! We've just cut
it off!


158
0:12:36,2 --> 0:12:40,94
V: We did! We cut off the rest of the pillow.
Which is what's great. There's no real set


159
0:12:40,94 --> 0:12:46,26
dimension on This one that we started. We
were just going with the flow and so we've


160
0:12:46,26 --> 0:12:53,43
decided to cut, what we need to do is cut
¼” above the last line.


161
0:12:53,43 --> 0:12:56,2
J: That's for your seam.


162
0:12:56,2 --> 0:12:59,57
V: Yes. OK, now what we're going to do, you
can take those.


163
0:12:59,57 --> 0:13:1,17
J: OK, we'll get rid of that white.


164
0:13:1,17 --> 0:13:7,48
V: So, what we're going to do is we're going
to use this last green strip which is the


165
0:13:7,48 --> 0:13:13,93
fifth one. Because we were doing five along
the way. We're going to do ¼” seam along


166
0:13:13,93 --> 0:13:16,46
the edge. Then we're going to open it up and
press it.


167
0:13:16,46 --> 0:13:18,31
J: And this is going to be like the cap strip.


168
0:13:18,31 --> 0:13:24,69
V: Yes the last one. You don't want this last
edge to be raw. So, we're going to make it


169
0:13:24,69 --> 0:13:26,67
look really nice and solid.


170
0:13:26,67 --> 0:13:29,339
J: Nice and finished.


171
0:13:29,339 --> 0:13:37,19
V: Finished. I see you.


172
0:13:37,19 --> 0:13:42,98
J: *laughter* This is so gorgeous! I love
how this looks.


173
0:13:42,98 --> 0:13:55,29
V: I think it's turned out really nice. OK,
so we have a ¼” seam, and now what I need


174
0:13:55,29 --> 0:13:57,0
you to do is press it open.


175
0:13:57,0 --> 0:13:57,959
J: OK.


176
0:13:57,959 --> 0:14:3,2
V: Press it like this so that we have a nice
little edge there.


177
0:14:3,2 --> 0:14:9,14
J: A little cap. Alright, so you want me to
open up this seam then?


178
0:14:9,14 --> 0:14:9,54
V: Yes.


179
0:14:9,54 --> 0:14:9,93
J: Alright.


180
0:14:9,93 --> 0:14:11,87
V: So it will lay flat better.


181
0:14:11,87 --> 0:14:19,3
J: OK, so we're going to iron this open. Sometimes
easier said than done, but our little point


182
0:14:19,3 --> 0:14:30,839
of the iron is braving the way. Alright there
we go. Keep it in the middle. The reason we're


183
0:14:30,839 --> 0:14:33,97
opening this is just so that it will lay flatter,
is that right?


184
0:14:33,97 --> 0:14:42,44
V: Yes so that it will lay flatter and so
that it gives you the nice flat seam if that


185
0:14:42,44 --> 0:14:43,76
makes sense.


186
0:14:43,76 --> 0:14:53,41
J: It does make sense. My seam's wanting to
wander. Let me see here if I can get this


187
0:14:53,41 --> 0:15:1,959
end. There we go. Pull that toward the middle
a little bit. Well it's a good thing this


188
0:15:1,959 --> 0:15:4,23
seams going to be hidden. *laughter*


189
0:15:4,23 --> 0:15:13,2
V: It's OK. So, now we have this right here
and we want to make sure that we cover that


190
0:15:13,2 --> 0:15:21,38
last seam. You can because we haven't really
been sticking to too much of a measurement


191
0:15:21,38 --> 0:15:28,779
with our lines. We're going to, even though
we're not butting upright against that line,


192
0:15:28,779 --> 0:15:34,31
we're going to just make sure the main thing
that we're focusing on is to cover that seam.


193
0:15:34,31 --> 0:15:36,459
J: Do you want me to draw another line?


194
0:15:36,459 --> 0:15:37,92
V: Yeah that might be good.


195
0:15:37,92 --> 0:15:40,73
J: OK so we can put a line that's ¼” in.


196
0:15:40,73 --> 0:15:41,47
V: Yeah.


197
0:15:41,47 --> 0:15:46,7
J: because it might have just been that my
lines were off. This is what's cool about


198
0:15:46,7 --> 0:15:54,3
these projects. You just make it work and
for instance, you may want to make it to fit


199
0:15:54,3 --> 0:15:59,18
a certain sized spot you're putting it in.
If you have a chair that you want it to fit


200
0:15:59,18 --> 0:16:5,66
in exactly then you could make the pillow
fit the area you want it to go.


201
0:16:5,66 --> 0:16:6,66
V: Right, right.


202
0:16:6,66 --> 0:16:10,92
J: So, now we have a line. It's always easier,
I think, to sew with a line. Don't you?


203
0:16:10,92 --> 0:16:17,75
V: Right, and here, this one I like to do
a smaller seam allowance, because it gives


204
0:16:17,75 --> 0:16:25,29
it a very nice clean finish when we sew it
on. This one will be the scant stitch.


205
0:16:25,29 --> 0:16:29,55
J: So, you're going to top stitch this basically,
right along this edge.


206
0:16:29,55 --> 0:16:30,22
V: Yup.


207
0:16:30,22 --> 0:16:31,22
J: OK, perfect.


208
0:16:31,22 --> 0:16:36,709
V: Here we go top-stitch it. Let's move this
over real quickly there you go. I'm going


209
0:16:36,709 --> 0:16:38,4
to top-stitch.


210
0:16:38,4 --> 0:16:43,19
J: And people just love to top-stitch on camera
don't they?!


211
0:16:43,19 --> 0:16:44,459
V: Yeah.


212
0:16:44,459 --> 0:16:45,899
J: *laughter*


213
0:16:45,899 --> 0:16:50,39
V: Yeah, whatever. I'll figure out where you
live!


214
0:16:50,39 --> 0:16:58,959
J: That's right! Aaah!


215
0:16:58,959 --> 0:17:8,439
V: I like to line it right inside that little
dip on my foot.


216
0:17:8,439 --> 0:17:10,61
J: Right it gives you a little guide.


217
0:17:10,61 --> 0:17:17,4
V: That way it gives you a little bit of a
line there to follow.


218
0:17:17,4 --> 0:17:25,829
J: And you can match your thread for your
color as well.


219
0:17:25,829 --> 0:17:33,13
V: Yes. Actually in my tutorial on my site
I do actually change threads throughout the


220
0:17:33,13 --> 0:17:42,11
project. So, that the lighter threads go with
the lighter fabrics and of course the darker


221
0:17:42,11 --> 0:17:48,48
ones have the really dark strips. That way
it also will make sure that you don't see


222
0:17:48,48 --> 0:17:51,95
your stitch very easily.


223
0:17:51,95 --> 0:18:3,61
J: You did a very good job! That's really
beautiful!


224
0:18:3,61 --> 0:18:6,27
V: Surprised it turned out that good! *laughter*


225
0:18:6,27 --> 0:18:8,11
J: You just never know.


226
0:18:8,11 --> 0:18:10,86
V: So, there we have the top-stitch


227
0:18:10,86 --> 0:18:13,38
J: A finished top! Look at that! It's beautiful!


228
0:18:13,38 --> 0:18:18,16
V: But it looks kind of wonky because were
still not completely done. So, what we're


229
0:18:18,16 --> 0:18:24,63
gonna do next is we're going to turn it over
and with our rotary cutter, and our ruler,


230
0:18:24,63 --> 0:18:26,65
we're going to cut off the excess.


231
0:18:26,65 --> 0:18:31,5
J: So, we're just going to line it up with
our fabric edge, because from the back you


232
0:18:31,5 --> 0:18:33,58
can see that very easily.


233
0:18:33,58 --> 0:18:35,58
V: Yes.


234
0:18:35,58 --> 0:18:45,62
J: Then to finish this because we now have
an undetermined size. We can use this as a


235
0:18:45,62 --> 0:18:46,73
pattern for the back as well.


236
0:18:46,73 --> 0:18:47,63
V: Perfect.


237
0:18:47,63 --> 0:18:51,4
J: I'm going to move all these threads out
here so they all get trimmed off at the same


238
0:18:51,4 --> 0:18:51,23
time.


239
0:18:51,23 --> 0:18:52,72
V: Yeah there's a lot of threads there.


240
0:18:52,72 --> 0:19:10,66
J: That's how we do it. Alright, so we do
those. Lay that down. We'll have to do a little


241
0:19:10,66 --> 0:19:23,53
bit of trimming. There we go. Alrighty, so
let's just trim that off. Collect these a


242
0:19:23,53 --> 0:19:27,13
little bit. Be very careful doing that. There
we go.


243
0:19:27,13 --> 0:19:34,92
V: So, when we turn it around you get a really
pretty idea of what your pillow is going to


244
0:19:34,92 --> 0:19:35,87
be like.


245
0:19:35,87 --> 0:19:43,9
J: So now we have our finished pillow here,
and because we trimmed it it's a different


246
0:19:43,9 --> 0:19:47,51
size than our back and we've got this yellow
piece here so that you can see the contrast


247
0:19:47,51 --> 0:19:52,0
all the way around. What we're going to do
then is we're going to put right sides together,


248
0:19:52,0 --> 0:19:59,179
like this. We're going to go ahead and trim
right around this pillow so that they're exactly


249
0:19:59,179 --> 0:20:6,46
the same size. So let's go ahead and do that.
I have this little mat so it'll just take


250
0:20:6,46 --> 0:20:10,74
a minute longer, but basically what I'm doing
is on this side is I'm cutting the salvage


251
0:20:10,74 --> 0:20:17,47
off and I'm cutting right up to the edge where
the pillow is. A piece right there.


252
0:20:17,47 --> 0:20:24,0
Then, I'm going to turn this and I think what
I'm going to do is scoot this right down to


253
0:20:24,0 --> 0:20:30,84
the edge so that I have one less side to cut
because that cut is straight. Then I'll move


254
0:20:30,84 --> 0:20:39,97
this over here and trim this off. So, to attach
your top to your back you're going to go ahead


255
0:20:39,97 --> 0:20:44,22
and stitch ¼” across the top and town the
sides and Then you're going to come right


256
0:20:44,22 --> 0:20:47,69
across here and leave what a 6” opening,
you think?


257
0:20:47,69 --> 0:20:53,53
V: Right. For the bottom one I just want to
make sure that if you don't want your pleat


258
0:20:53,53 --> 0:20:59,799
to be sewn in. It'll be fine if it is sewn
in I just personally left it un-sewn. I wanted


259
0:20:59,799 --> 0:21:0,46
it to be free.


260
0:21:0,46 --> 0:21:0,69
J: OK.


261
0:21:0,69 --> 0:21:7,69
V: So, I actually pushed in my pleat just
ever so slightly So that when I did do my


262
0:21:7,69 --> 0:21:9,87
¼” seam it did not get caught in it.


263
0:21:9,87 --> 0:21:14,22
J: Oh OK! Perfect. OK, so let's look at the
one you've got there. So, we can look at the


264
0:21:14,22 --> 0:21:15,169
bottom of that pleat.


265
0:21:15,169 --> 0:21:18,8
V: And then here's the pleat. So, you can
see how...


266
0:21:18,8 --> 0:21:21,88
J: Oh yeah, it's a little bit on the edge
and then in the middle.


267
0:21:21,88 --> 0:21:23,12
V: And then this is free.


268
0:21:23,12 --> 0:21:26,75
J: Then this is her hand-sewing right here
where you're going to put all the fluff.


269
0:21:26,75 --> 0:21:27,46
V: Yes.


270
0:21:27,46 --> 0:21:31,63
J: and fill it out to the size that you want
it and then hand-stitch it closed.


271
0:21:31,63 --> 0:21:32,78
V: Yup, hand-stitch it closed.


272
0:21:32,78 --> 0:21:34,74
J: and then finished it looks like this.


273
0:21:34,74 --> 0:21:38,41
V: And I think the green one is going to look
really pretty too.


274
0:21:38,41 --> 0:21:42,22
J: Oh, it's going to be beautiful. I can hardly
wait to get it all together and get the back


275
0:21:42,22 --> 0:21:48,38
on it. So, this is the final pillow I think
this is just gorgeous. The green one is beautiful


276
0:21:48,38 --> 0:21:54,9
also so let's take another look at that. This
is how our green one is going to look. I'm


277
0:21:54,9 --> 0:21:58,38
just going to go ahead and scoot this out
of the way. So this is how our green one is


278
0:21:58,38 --> 0:21:59,9
going to look.


279
0:21:59,9 --> 0:22:4,419
So, we hope you enjoyed this tutorial on how
to make a pleated pillow with Vanessa Christenson


280
0:22:4,419 --> 0:24:4,419
