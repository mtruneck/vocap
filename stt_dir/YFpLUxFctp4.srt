1
0:0:0,8 --> 0:0:3,21
grandpa has been in the east side of it
being the and i think it's pretty


2
0:0:3,21 --> 0:0:6,54
obvious winemakers you know arrive forty
sixteen


3
0:0:6,54 --> 0:0:11,629
and he's a native ron on the platform
the a libertarian who


4
0:0:11,629 --> 0:0:15,729
who uh... respects people's individual
rights that's why did you know outfits


5
0:0:15,729 --> 0:0:16,359
from now


6
0:0:16,359 --> 0:0:20,31
on the rights of a number of issues and
uh... one of the main issue based on the


7
0:0:20,31 --> 0:0:24,39
come on the right side is civil
liberties of course that film strikes at


8
0:0:24,39 --> 0:0:27,48
as opposition to the confirmation of
uh... of bread


9
0:0:27,48 --> 0:0:30,4
uh... in arizona talk about sal


10
0:0:30,4 --> 0:0:31,409
the about


11
0:0:31,409 --> 0:0:34,77
the g_o_p_ an evangelical being to deter


12
0:0:34,77 --> 0:0:36,67
to go to war


13
0:0:36,67 --> 0:0:37,739
i'd like to hear


14
0:0:37,739 --> 0:0:42,31
i think that it is important that what
we talk about war


15
0:0:42,31 --> 0:0:46,32
that i think part of republicans
problems and frankly it a true some in


16
0:0:46,32 --> 0:0:50,79
the evangelical christian movement i
think it appeared to be here for war


17
0:0:50,79 --> 0:0:54,73
i tell them you know when i read the new
testament and when i read about jesus i


18
0:0:54,73 --> 0:0:58,33
don't see men being involved he was
really involved with the war of his days


19
0:0:58,33 --> 0:1:2,4
in fact people rebuked him for not being
the king they wanted they wanted


20
0:1:2,4 --> 0:1:4,409
somebody stand up to the romans


21
0:1:4,409 --> 0:1:8,47
blessed are the peacemakers not listed
on the war makers


22
0:1:8,47 --> 0:1:10,3
that is about four hours


23
0:1:10,3 --> 0:1:12,94
i did not see that coming did you think
you're going to do that i was gonna be


24
0:1:12,94 --> 0:1:16,95
some lip service he but right at them
and use their own uh... bible against


25
0:1:16,95 --> 0:1:20,57
them it sounds just rational enough to
eliminate any chance he has a huge


26
0:1:20,57 --> 0:1:23,249
kicking out and


27
0:1:23,249 --> 0:1:27,229
yes that's the only reason tracklisting
do you start going its own writings


28
0:1:27,229 --> 0:1:31,229
chances those rationale is he doing that
financial reports did when he was in the


29
0:1:31,229 --> 0:1:31,99
dates


30
0:1:31,99 --> 0:1:36,2
and i remember watching it missed before
i get really political river him saying


31
0:1:36,2 --> 0:1:39,26
line against nation building outside
what is even talking about


32
0:1:39,26 --> 0:1:42,45
take a look it up but that meant and of
course as soon as he became president he


33
0:1:42,45 --> 0:1:44,7
started nation building so is this that


34
0:1:44,7 --> 0:1:48,509
i'm going to make uh... plead to the
moderates on the libertarians out there


35
0:1:48,509 --> 0:1:51,329
to make them think i'm not a war monger
then as soon as he becomes president of


36
0:1:51,329 --> 0:1:52,65
a war monger


37
0:1:52,65 --> 0:1:54,39
added up the estate


38
0:1:54,39 --> 0:1:58,75
aramony's seems to me that catalyst your
desire to lose the magellan also their


39
0:1:58,75 --> 0:2:2,35
vote for it offered as opposed to the
reporting


40
0:2:2,35 --> 0:2:5,63
soul maybe he's doing that they will
restrain you get the middle to come


41
0:2:5,63 --> 0:2:10,99
what regarding the presidency has
captured by military vessel


42
0:2:10,99 --> 0:2:11,799
yeah it was as a democrat


43
0:2:11,799 --> 0:2:12,909
republican


44
0:2:12,909 --> 0:2:15,78
or maybe even a bit the libertarian i
don't know uh...


45
0:2:15,78 --> 0:2:19,65
they're good war monger hazardous so
much money the


46
0:2:19,65 --> 0:2:20,949
today


47
0:2:20,949 --> 0:2:22,929
yes uh... with escaping it


48
0:2:22,929 --> 0:2:26,4
uh... with with ron paul on this issue


49
0:2:26,4 --> 0:2:29,869
uh... at least easily get allot of
sympathy


50
0:2:29,869 --> 0:2:34,449
everyone because who is really fear of
the warranty other that those were were


51
0:2:34,449 --> 0:2:36,709
permitted to making money on that


52
0:2:36,709 --> 0:2:41,93
and how still he's approx removes cell


53
0:2:41,93 --> 0:2:44,729
dollars so maybe you want to the
campaign contributions


54
0:2:44,729 --> 0:2:47,949
but he would get uh... support from
republicans issue


55
0:2:47,949 --> 0:2:49,169
and i think


56
0:2:49,169 --> 0:2:50,89
uh... he's reposition himself


57
0:2:50,89 --> 0:2:52,599
pretty well because


58
0:2:52,599 --> 0:2:56,9
just in terms of style as appearance


59
0:2:56,9 --> 0:2:59,599
his dad kar raha seemed a little bit


60
0:2:59,599 --> 0:3:5,67
uh... means losing presidential directly
since he was a small blouses for us to


61
0:3:5,67 --> 0:3:9,53
package whatever it is the susie you
happiest of people into some of them


62
0:3:9,53 --> 0:3:11,6
program policies


63
0:3:11,6 --> 0:3:15,83
livermore livermore brother prosperity
and if you can't just say about saint


64
0:3:15,83 --> 0:3:17,239
james' steam yet


65
0:3:17,239 --> 0:3:18,329
perhaps the middle


66
0:3:18,329 --> 0:3:20,4
to cometh inside


67
0:3:20,4 --> 0:3:22,99
had a remarkable work there is a
franchise with the government could like


68
0:3:22,99 --> 0:3:25,51
people like me compensate for the
government


69
0:3:25,51 --> 0:3:28,499
i'm sick of uh... the democrats


70
0:3:28,499 --> 0:3:30,41
increase you mean this plot


71
0:3:30,41 --> 0:3:34,43
government that we have whatever the
problem and and samson yes


72
0:3:34,43 --> 0:3:37,519
uh... that we can't even on an issue
where ninety percent of the american


73
0:3:37,519 --> 0:3:39,169
people are for like backwards


74
0:3:39,169 --> 0:3:43,37
we're not gonna get a because reno we
live in a blue talk with the right this


75
0:3:43,37 --> 0:3:46,439
is one of the talk was it looks like
ladies and gentlemen one the american


76
0:3:46,439 --> 0:3:50,129
people overwhelmingly want something and
they don't get why because


77
0:3:50,129 --> 0:3:54,89
there's a handful of people with money
you don't want a and that's it


78
0:3:54,89 --> 0:3:56,579
philosophically manholes


79
0:3:56,579 --> 0:3:59,2
striking the right time to reposition
himself well


80
0:3:59,2 --> 0:4:2,87
now is a reading stories playing i think
in twenty sixteen an


81
0:4:2,87 --> 0:4:5,199
who knows practical


82
0:4:5,199 --> 0:4:7,919
pride when that battle anyway


83
0:4:7,919 --> 0:4:8,95
i think he's


84
0:4:8,95 --> 0:4:10,129
the smart about it


85
0:4:10,129 --> 0:4:13,329
i'd like to strike at the center you
know if i can assure disrespect in


86
0:4:13,329 --> 0:4:16,789
tennessee but i think that you might be
interesting to groups their think that


87
0:4:16,789 --> 0:4:17,729
fishery that he


88
0:4:17,729 --> 0:4:22,19
would in some my pathetic will sense get
the support it but one i think that you


89
0:4:22,19 --> 0:4:24,919
might be addressing the willingness of
the republican base to be whipped up


90
0:4:24,919 --> 0:4:29,279
into a frenzy of fear over say iran may
be in the next couple of years like they


91
0:4:29,279 --> 0:4:32,779
gathered or war now but i think that
they can be convinced like a war in the


92
0:4:32,779 --> 0:4:36,659
next couple of years and also he will
lose but he said the donors but he's


93
0:4:36,659 --> 0:4:39,719
also been a lose the media lately has
already and from what i've seen a lot


94
0:4:39,719 --> 0:4:42,189
like krauthammer bill kristol things
like that i think he's already lost


95
0:4:42,189 --> 0:4:47,629
foxnews and i think that in america for
the most part another people support the


96
0:4:47,629 --> 0:4:50,759
people there told the support let me or
twelve year old girl you like to pop


97
0:4:50,759 --> 0:4:54,56
stars are told like and when you are
voting a republican nominating contest i


98
0:4:54,56 --> 0:4:56,759
think that you support the people you
told the support


99
0:4:56,759 --> 0:5:0,949
i think that it'll be too easy for them
the cast him as just as crazy as from


100
0:5:0,949 --> 0:5:4,989
paul in fox news over the course of next
two years nude howard dean


101
0:5:4,989 --> 0:5:8,379
lot of people love them but they cast
his grades aren't many losses on a


102
0:5:8,379 --> 0:5:12,199
supporter i was very easy when it is the
military industrial complex and they got


103
0:5:12,199 --> 0:5:13,51
rid of them right away


104
0:5:13,51 --> 0:5:17,23
saying wait a bigotry eliot spitzer he
went against wall street they got rid of


105
0:5:17,23 --> 0:5:20,8
him right away and he has every
nefarious waiting given be they were


106
0:5:20,8 --> 0:5:25,0
using of the patriot act to get him for
being in a person's unbelievable that is


107
0:5:25,0 --> 0:5:27,63
crazy will see it


108
0:5:27,63 --> 0:5:30,12
forty agree with the u_n_ and we'll see


109
0:5:30,12 --> 0:5:34,63
and i think what brand policy try to do
is write you know circumvent all of that


110
0:5:34,63 --> 0:5:38,27
but directly to the people are saying


111
0:5:38,27 --> 0:5:42,399
that'll be democracy inaction but will
see i but i think


112
0:5:42,399 --> 0:5:44,789
your largely correct that


113
0:5:44,789 --> 0:5:47,56
he doesn't have the donors he doesn't
have fox news


114
0:5:47,56 --> 0:7:47,56
he can't win the nomination
