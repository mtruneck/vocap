###56 FRANKIE GILLIM: Most of the kids' real close friends were,
###58 I mean, their best friends were racers.
###60 
###63 HAYDEN GILLIM: This race, me and Mathew qualified crap.
###68 Together, he qualified 19th, I qualified 22nd.
###70 MATHEW SCHOLTZ: I mean, we all come out to race, so we all
###74 love the same thing.
###75 So everything's good.
###77 We're all mates.
###79 HAYDEN GILLIM: Him and Sturla and Jake, we're all buds and
###82 we're all pretty close off the track.
###83 And we can all cheer each other up and make jokes and
###88 everything all day long, and then once we get onto the
###89 racetrack, we're kind of like a team.
###92 
###97 HAYDEN GILLIM: As in, Pen Islands?
###100 MATHEW SCHOLTZ: Pen Islands.
###102 [SPEAKING JAPANESE]
###104 
###116 MARC GAGNE: He's not here to make friends.
###118 He's said that for years.
###119 I don't come to races to make friends.
###121 I can make friends any time.
###122 I come here to do my job and try to win a race.
###125 So considering where we are, we don't know the tracks, we
###129 know very few people over here, we don't know the
###131 language, so he's got to grasp every little bit of
###135 information he can gather and then try to apply it in a very
###138 short amount of time.
###139 
###145 PETER CLIFFORD: The Rookies Cup is simple and all race
###147 weekends are pretty much the same.
###150 We start with a free non-qualifying session, where
###153 the guys can just go out, get the feel of the bike.
###156 And then we have two qualifying periods, both half
###158 an hour each, and it's their best lap time from either of
###162 those two sessions that gives them their grid position.
###164 
###169 HAYDEN GILLIM: I went faster, I don't know if I did better.
###171 
###174 As soon as my dad gets in here, he'll tell me.
###176 
###187 JAKE GAGNE: Felt pretty good.
###188 The bike was working good.
###189 It was a bit windy.
###190 I think I ended up sixth on the grid for tomorrow's race
###193 so I'm happy.
###196 Hayden Gillim was 22nd and Benny Solis was 23rd.
###202 BENNY SOLIS: I don't know, Jake's been doing really good.
###205 But I feel like I should be up there with him. 'Cause last
###207 year, I was always with him.
###209 Most of the time, I was in front, and towards the end he
###212 was right there with me.
###215 HAYDEN GILLIM: Last year I raced some of these guys, and
###218 I was up front with them, and then this year just haven't
###222 been able to get the bike put together, and haven't been
###225 able to put together any results.
###227 And I've only got, like, 10 points out of possible 75.
###234 KEVIN SCHWANTZ: One of the most difficult things as a
###236 rider is coming here and trying to stay focused without
###238 getting frustrated with yourself.
###240 You look at your lap time, you're 2 seconds or 3 seconds
###243 behind the leaders, that seems like an eternity as a rider.
###247 You're working with 13- to 16-year-old kids.
###249 It's another scenario that throws a big curve ball into
###253 everything, 'cause some kids mentally are really strong,
###256 and some kids, just the slightest little excuse they
###259 can think of, then their attitude goes out the window
###262 and their focus is gone and they don't even really want to
###264 go riding anymore.
###267 DANNY WALKER: You don't make excuses.
###268 Everybody from second on down has excuses
###271 on why I'm not winning.
###273 First guy, you got none.
###274 I'm good.
###275 From second, oh I've got a ton of excuses
###277 on why I'm not there.
###278 But Hayden realistically is just too
###280 big, he grew too much.
###282 FRANKIE GILLIM: At 125, it's about like in America.
###284 You've got to be jockey size.
###286 And Hayden's not a jockey.
###287 They know he has ability from last year, and AMA, and then
###291 when he came over here during the rider's club.
###293 He had the pole at Valencia.
###295 GUSTL AUINGER: It's very hard for the boys.
###299 I can understand this very much because
###301 they want to win races.
###303 But every result have some reason.
###305 
###381 FRANKIE GILLIM: The only thing I ever really say to him
###383 before a race is that I love him, and to go have fun.
###387 Fire it up.
###388 [MOTORCYCLE ENGINES REVVING]

###408 PETER CLIFFORD: So Fagerhaug goes for the lead.
###410 Beautiful move from the [INAUDIBLE].
###411 And absolutely superb stuff, totally unhurried.
###414 Just slides past there.
###416 That [INAUDIBLE]
###417 coming down to the [INAUDIBLE].
###418 It's Fagerhaug that leads, it's Marino that
###419 is in second place.
###421 Absolutely superb stuff.
###422 There's what?
###423 There's eight, 10 guys there crossing the line together.
###426 And this time it's Gagne that leads from Kent, Fagerhaug,
###429 Marino, Kristiansson, Hiura, Hook, and Kornfeil.
###431 
###440 Fagerhaug is making his escape.
###444 He started the lap with 8/10 of a second advantage.
###447 It's already, I think, gone out of effect, and once it
###449 gets past a second, it is really hard to pull back.
###453 Kornfeil goes up the inside of Gagne.
###456 But the advantage now that Fagerhaug has
###459 over Kent is 1 second.
###460 
###465 Fagerhaug thrashes across the line.
###467 Well, what an absolutely superb race.
###469 And there is Daijiro Hiura, the Japanese
###471 who finished second.
###472 Brilliant ride from him.
###474 And what a good ride from Jake Gagne.
###476 MARC GAGNE: He just did well, man.
###477 He's running right where he should be, led for a few laps,
###479 so he did awesome, more than I could expect.
###483 JAKE GAGNE: Towards the end, it came down
###484 just to the last corner.
###485 And I just made some mistakes in the middle of the race, and
###488 it kind of caught me, but happy to be on the podium.
###491 PETER CLIFFORD: Daijiro Hiura in second place.
###496 [BAND PLAYING]
###505 DAIJIRO HIURA: Yes.
###506 
###509 Maybe shoes.
###512 
###515 Second.
###517 Yes.
###519 Thank you.
###520 
###542 DANNY WALKER: Seen so many parents where the kid's not
###543 having a good day and they jump on them and they're
###545 yelling at them.
###546 I'm like, dude, there's guys making $2, $3, $4 million a
###549 year that have bad days.
###551 Have you never, as a professional,
###552 ever had a bad day?
###553 If he doesn't have that inner, burning, driving desire to
###558 pass the guy or be better or go faster, then you can't
###561 develop that.
###562 FRANKIE GILLIM: 12th.
###565 You did good.
###566 We dropped, again.
###567 HAYDEN GILLIM: I was braking, then, like, 30 seconds later,
###570 they brake and just freaking hit everybody
###573 and run off the track.
###574 And then, freaking, they wouldn't slow down.
###576 Finished 12th, so it was OK.
###580 It wasn't amazing, but starting from 22nd it was
###584 pretty good.
###585 For some reason, I am horrible in qualifying and then come
###589 back and get OK positions.
###592 FRANKIE GILLIM: We're just a day late and a dollar short
###597 every time so far.
###598 We just gotta get up to pace quicker.
###601 This'll be the last time you'll see me.
###603 -Really?
###603 FRANKIE GILLIM: I'm out.
###604 I don't have no time left to get off.
###606 -That was good stuff.
###607 FRANKIE GILLIM: Yeah, it was.
###609 I mean, We improved a whole bunch.
###613 -Hot out there.
###614 
###625 MARC GAGNE: It's not about the money or the fame necessarily.
###628 In my eyes, and I'm sure his, it's about going and doing the
###631 best you possibly can.
###632 And if the best you can takes you to the top, then more
###636 power to you 'cause you did a great job.
###638 You know, as a dad, I knew he could be there all the time,
###641 so I say hail to the Americans.
###644 Podium--
###645 it's all good.
###646 
###650 HAYDEN GILLIM: At first it was just about having fun, and
###653 travel around the world, and make lot of friends.
###656 Now it's gotten more about money and everything else.
###660 But I try and focus on just having fun.
###664 FRANKIE GILLIM: I guess this year, he's having to persevere
###668 through struggling on the bike.
###671 He's never had to before.
###673 It's always been natural.
###674 And here, natural ability's only going to get you so far.
###678 And then from there, you've got to have knowledge,
###682 maturity in what you're trying to do.
###684 On the track, off the track, try to put it all together to
###687 become one whole.
###688
