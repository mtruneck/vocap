CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: It`s a new month, but
millions of Americans are starting November


2
0:0:15,58 --> 0:0:21,8
in the same situation as how they ended October.
In the aftermath of the so called Super storm


3
0:0:21,8 --> 0:0:29,97
Sandy. It leads off today`s program.


4
0:0:29,97 --> 0:0:34,5
One meteorologist called Sandy a storm that
will be talked about for generations. The


5
0:0:34,5 --> 0:0:39,5
numbers tell part of the story. At least 50
deaths in the U.S., millions of people still


6
0:0:39,5 --> 0:0:45,52
without power on Wednesday, 10 to $20 billion
in estimated property damage and lost business.


7
0:0:45,52 --> 0:0:50,85
But the images, the snapshots of the devastation,
that`s what really make it hit home. Head


8
0:0:50,85 --> 0:0:56,26
up to the Jersey shore to Seaside Heights,
the boardwalk, the amusement pier. This is


9
0:0:56,26 --> 0:1:1,489
what it looks like now, the park still there.
Some of the pier was washed out to sea, the


10
0:1:1,489 --> 0:1:6,329
rollercoaster is still standing, but now it`s
out in the ocean. Getting around parts of


11
0:1:6,329 --> 0:1:12,43
New York and New Jersey means riding in a
yellow cab, but these won`t be stopping to


12
0:1:12,43 --> 0:1:17,479
pick up passengers any time soon: Flooding
caused damage to rail lines all across New


13
0:1:17,479 --> 0:1:19,219
Jersey as well.


14
0:1:19,219 --> 0:1:24,9
Two airports in the New York area were planning
to start limited service yesterday, but not


15
0:1:24,9 --> 0:1:28,969
LaGuardia Airport. It`s runways and concourses
remained empty because of significant storm


16
0:1:28,969 --> 0:1:32,42
damage although it is scheduled to reopen
today.


17
0:1:32,42 --> 0:1:36,85
Getting around underground was limited, too.
Most New York Subway tunnels were still flooded


18
0:1:36,85 --> 0:1:40,319
yesterday with no estimate for when they might
reopen.


19
0:1:40,319 --> 0:1:45,259
Of course, those aren`t the only images from
the past few days, this was a massive storm,


20
0:1:45,259 --> 0:1:48,81
it brought scenes of disaster and it brought
scenes of heroism, too.

VOICE OF MAYOR BILL AKERS, SEASIDE HEIGHTS,
NEW JERSEY: We`re riding around, it`s two


23
0:1:52,2 --> 0:1:56,329
o`clock in the morning, and we are pulling
people out of the water. You see these people


24
0:1:56,329 --> 0:2:0,539
and these cars load down the street, and these
guys do this -- they do this with no regards


25
0:2:0,539 --> 0:2:5,63
to anything other than they want to do the
right thing and help. And you get inspired


26
0:2:5,63 --> 0:2:10,289
by things like that, and I just don`t know
where it comes from in individuals like this.


27
0:2:10,289 --> 0:2:16,26
VOICE OF SEN. ROBERT MENENDEZ, NEW JERSEY:
You have National Guard now, thank God, helping


28
0:2:16,26 --> 0:2:20,62
rescue people out of their homes, but there
is nowhere to go. There is a very thick stench


29
0:2:20,62 --> 0:2:27,17
of gasoline in the water as well. So you have
a real challenge to the (inaudible) here.


30
0:2:27,17 --> 0:2:30,78
VOICE OF GOV. ANDREW CUOMO, NEW YORK: First,
once again, I want to congratulate all the


31
0:2:30,78 --> 0:2:35,51
first responders who were still out there,
and still doing a magnificent job under difficult


32
0:2:35,51 --> 0:2:37,549
circumstances. We should all be very proud.

That`s something the presidential candidates
did as Governor Romney and President Obama


38
0:2:54,599 --> 0:3:0,0
stopped campaigning for a few days. Romney
turned his campaign rallies in the storm relief


39
0:3:0,0 --> 0:3:3,42
events. And people were encouraged to bring
canned goods to help victims.

MITT ROMNEY, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:
We have heavy hearts, as you know, with all


42
0:3:7,28 --> 0:3:11,549
the suffering going on in a major part of
our country, a lot of people hurt in this


43
0:3:11,549 --> 0:3:14,34
morning, they were hurting last night, and
the storm goes on.


44
0:3:14,34 --> 0:3:18,67
I appreciate the fact that people right here
in Dayton got up this morning, some went to


45
0:3:18,67 --> 0:3:23,48
the grocery store, I see and purchased some
things that these families will need. And


46
0:3:23,48 --> 0:3:25,19
I appreciate you generosity.

48
0:3:26,129 --> 0:3:29,95
AZUZ: President Obama and Governor Romney
have been encouraging donations to the Red


49
0:3:29,95 --> 0:3:34,12
Cross, and yesterday, the president went to
New Jersey to see some of the damage caused


50
0:3:34,12 --> 0:3:37,959
by Sandy and to extend his thoughts to the
families affected by the storm.

0:3:37,959 --> 0:3:38,4
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


52
0:3:38,4 --> 0:3:41,78
BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA: Our hearts go out to the families


53
0:3:41,78 --> 0:3:47,9
who have lost loved ones. It`s true that because
of some good preparation, the loss of life


54
0:3:47,9 --> 0:3:54,56
was kept lower than it might have been, but
for those individual families, obviously,


55
0:3:54,56 --> 0:3:59,59
their world has been torn apart. The sooner
we can get our kids back into school, the


56
0:3:59,59 --> 0:4:3,909
sooner they are back in the routine, that
obviously helps the families and helps the


57
0:4:3,909 --> 0:4:5,12
kids as well.


58
0:4:5,12 --> 0:4:11,599
GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE, (R ), NEW JERSEY: Right
now, I`m much more concerned about preventing


59
0:4:11,599 --> 0:4:15,79
any other loss of life, getting people to
safe places, and then we`ll worry about the


60
0:4:15,79 --> 0:4:18,92
election. The election will take care of itself.


61
0:4:18,92 --> 0:4:20,78
(END VIDEO CLIP)


62
0:4:20,78 --> 0:4:25,6
AZUZ: OK, Governor Christie understandably
says he`s focused on people over politics


63
0:4:25,6 --> 0:4:29,95
now. But some folks are thinking about next
Tuesday`s election, and one thing they`ve


64
0:4:29,95 --> 0:4:34,72
been wondering is whether Sandy will have
an effect. Remember, power is out in parts


65
0:4:34,72 --> 0:4:39,47
of several states, places where people vote
may had been flooded or damaged, but officials


66
0:4:39,47 --> 0:4:43,7
in most of these states still expect things
to go smoothly on election day.


67
0:4:43,7 --> 0:4:47,97
As for the candidates, they took a break for
the campaign trail for a few days, but things


68
0:4:47,97 --> 0:4:50,47
started to pick up again on Wednesday.


69
0:4:50,47 --> 0:4:54,6
Governor Romney was attending a campaign event
in Florida, President Obama is scheduled to


70
0:4:54,6 --> 0:4:59,98
be out on the campaign trail again today.
One difference, thought: the tone of the campaigns,


71
0:4:59,98 --> 0:5:3,58
which have gotten kind of harsh at times,
is more positive.


72
0:5:3,58 --> 0:5:8,9
We`ve been looking this week where President
Obama and Governor Romney stand on some of


73
0:5:8,9 --> 0:5:12,7
the issues. Today, we are focusing on healthcare.
For both candidates, a lot of the focus on


74
0:5:12,7 --> 0:5:18,41
this issue involves the Affordable Care Act,
also known as Obamacare. A lot of political


75
0:5:18,41 --> 0:5:23,7
experts consider it President Obama`s biggest
accomplishment. It says that insurance companies


76
0:5:23,7 --> 0:5:28,26
cannot deny someone coverage, if they have
a preexisting condition. And it requires most


77
0:5:28,26 --> 0:5:34,57
Americans to have some kind of health insurance
by 2014, or face a fine. There were some law


78
0:5:34,57 --> 0:5:41,16
suits about whether that requirement was constitutional.
The U.S. Supreme Court eventually said" "Yes."


79
0:5:41,16 --> 0:5:45,81
Governor Romney says, if he`s elected, he`ll
work to get the health care law overturned.


80
0:5:45,81 --> 0:5:49,52
When he was governor of Massachusetts, Romney
helped create a health care plan that was


81
0:5:49,52 --> 0:5:55,38
similar to President Obama`s. One difference,
he says, is that it was limited to one state.


82
0:5:55,38 --> 0:5:59,61
Governor Romney says health care solutions
should come from individual states rather


83
0:5:59,61 --> 0:6:1,7
than from the federal government.

J.P. Knapp Early College High School in Currituck,
North Carolina.


87
0:6:12,63 --> 0:6:19,13
Which country has the largest population in
the European Union? Here we go, is it Germany,


88
0:6:19,13 --> 0:6:26,59
France, United Kingdom or Spain? You`ve got
three seconds, go!


89
0:6:26,59 --> 0:6:34,16
With more than 80 million residents, Germany
has the European Union`s largest population.


90
0:6:34,16 --> 0:6:38,75
That`s your answer and that`s your "Shoutout."

92
0:6:40,71 --> 0:6:45,84
AZUZ: Germany is also where you find the largest
American military community outside of the


93
0:6:45,84 --> 0:6:50,34
United States. And part of the reason for
that is what happened after World War II,


94
0:6:50,34 --> 0:6:54,71
Germany was divided into two countries, you
had East Germany and West Germany. The West


95
0:6:54,71 --> 0:6:59,8
was established in part by the United States,
the East was controlled by the Soviet Union,


96
0:6:59,8 --> 0:7:5,49
a rival of the U.S. And Germany reunified
in 1990, near the end of the cold war. But


97
0:7:5,49 --> 0:7:10,34
George Howell shows us how history has a hold
on those raised between different nations.

GEORGE HOWELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: This year
marched the 25th anniversary of that famous


102
0:7:19,9 --> 0:7:24,5
phrase, but the impact of the U.S. military
build-up in Germany during the Cold War is


103
0:7:24,5 --> 0:7:32,14
still being felt today, in an unlikely place:
the soccer field. A half dozen sons of American


104
0:7:32,14 --> 0:7:37,92
soldiers, stationed in Germany, born to German
mothers, have elected to play for the U.S.


105
0:7:37,92 --> 0:7:41,67
national soccer team rather than Germany`s
in the last few years.


106
0:7:41,67 --> 0:7:47,42
For some, this decision relates to their racial
identity: Danny Williams and the other five


107
0:7:47,42 --> 0:7:49,72
players all have African American fathers.


108
0:7:49,72 --> 0:7:57,6
(on camera): What does it mean to be biracial
in Germany versus being biracial here in the


109
0:7:57,6 --> 0:7:57,6
United States.


110
0:7:57,6 --> 0:8:0,5
DANNY WILLIAMS, UNITED STATES MIDFIELDER:
When people are looking at me in Germany,


111
0:8:0,5 --> 0:8:5,83
they know that I`m not 100 percent German.
I told my parents that it isn`t -- I feel


112
0:8:5,83 --> 0:8:7,43
more American than German.


113
0:8:7,43 --> 0:8:11,55
HOWELL (voice over): Jermaine Jones was the
first of this recent wave from Germany to


114
0:8:11,55 --> 0:8:13,6
join the American soccer team.


115
0:8:13,6 --> 0:8:16,64
JERMAINE JONES, UNITED STATES SOLDIER: I`m
different, when you see me, to German people.


116
0:8:16,64 --> 0:8:18,52
I`m a different guy. I`m mixed.


117
0:8:18,52 --> 0:8:23,58
HOWELL: Unlike Williams, whose American father
raised him in Germany, Jones grew up in a


118
0:8:23,58 --> 0:8:24,98
single parent household.


119
0:8:24,98 --> 0:8:31,0
JONES: My mom and him goes when I was young,
separate ways, and for me it was hard, too,


120
0:8:31,0 --> 0:8:32,51
to grow up with no dad.


121
0:8:32,51 --> 0:8:37,339
HOWELL: But since electing to play for the
U.S., Jones had rekindled his relationship


122
0:8:37,339 --> 0:8:43,31
with his father. After scoring his first goal
for the Starts and Stripes, Jones performed


123
0:8:43,31 --> 0:8:46,56
a simple, but poignant tribute to his soldier
father.


124
0:8:46,56 --> 0:8:49,5
(on camera): You gave a salute to your dad.


125
0:8:49,5 --> 0:8:56,28
JONES: Yeah, he called me after game, he`s
like -- God, thank you all, my mom, my brother,


126
0:8:56,28 --> 0:8:59,68
everybody sees it, and everybody`s proud of
you.


127
0:8:59,68 --> 0:9:5,3
HOWELL: A simple gesture of pride, but one
rooted in history.

spirit. HLN asked college marching bands to


131
0:9:13,79 --> 0:9:19,8
send an I-Report to their best work, and X
marks the spot for Bethune Cookman (ph). Marching,


132
0:9:19,8 --> 0:9:22,27
playing and not running into each other -- truly
extraordinarily.


133
0:9:22,27 --> 0:9:27,3
Now, for the University of Iowa. They are
paying tribute to an old school Michael Jackson


134
0:9:27,3 --> 0:9:31,39
hit, giving the hawk-eye audience a "Thriller."
And while the term "horseplay: indicates you


135
0:9:31,39 --> 0:9:36,98
are not taking something seriously, look at
this -- Ohio State`s band, seriously awesome.


136
0:9:36,98 --> 0:9:40,33
Some would say these buckeyes are nuts.


137
0:9:40,33 --> 0:9:46,5
It`s amazing what can happen when people band
together. They get so attuned to what`s playing


138
0:9:46,5 --> 0:9:50,4
out around them, that after getting their
marching orders, the result is band to the


139
0:9:50,4 --> 0:9:53,78
trombone. All right. Saying a lot of puns
a little bit at a time can leave me kind of


140
0:9:53,78 --> 0:11:53,78
winded. But take note -- we`ll be fielding
more headlines tomorrow, on CNN STUDENT NEWS.
