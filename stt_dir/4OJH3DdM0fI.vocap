###31 Reading something ahead, Commander.
###32 Looks to be a nebula
###34 Slow to Warp Factor 1, Lieutenant Jenson
###36 Sensor scans, Mr Bernstein
###41 BERNSTEIN: It's not a nebula
###42 I'm picking up several different kinds of energy--
###45 Radiation readings of a kind I've never seen before.
###48 Put it on the main viewer.
###52 We're heading right for it.
###55 [MYSTERIOUS MUSIC]
###73 Should we wake the Captain, sir?
###79 Not necessary...
###80 Radiation and Electromagnetic readings are well within their tolerance limits
###83 But doesn't the Captain like to be notified...
###85 ...whenever we come across something that might be considered unusual.
###88 SULU: This poses no threat, Ensign
###91 Take us through it at Warp 1
###93 Survey and map it.
###95 The Captain can review the computer logs over his morning coffee

###251 KIRK: Going for a morning swim, Lieutenant?`
###253 You know there are green ladies at the pool, right
###259 Oh. Good morning, Ensign Isel
###267 Deltans.
###289 [DOORS OPEN]
###291 MCCOY: Ah. Good morning, Ensign.
###292 Well if you can call turning the lights up at 0700 hours "morning"
###296 ISEL: I don't understand it.
###298 I have not broken my vow.
###301 Yet I can feel it inside me.
###305 What's wrong, Isel?
###309 I'm pregnant, Doctor.
###310 [DRAMATIC STING]
###314 [MAIN THEME]
###320 Space,
###322 The Final Frontier...
###328 These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise
###332 It's Five Year Mission...
###333 To Explore Strange New Worlds
###336 To Seek Out New Life and New Civilizations
###340 To Boldly Go...
###341 Where No Man Has Gone Before.
###377 MCCOY: Medical Log, Supplemental:
###380 After a pregnancy of only three days...
###382 Rather than the normal ten month Deltan gestation period...
###385 Ensign Isel is about to give birth.
###390 The strange circumstances surrounding her pregnancy
###392 have raised deep concerns as to the nature of the infant.
###396 Contractions are spaced at two minutes and regular, Doctor.
###401 Dilation is at 9 cm.
###403 The baby's heartbeat is normal.
###406 I don't know how she's doing this.
###408 The strain on her body to adjust so quicklyâ€¦
###412 If she wasn't a Deltan...
###413 There is nothing to worry about, Doctor.
###415 She'll be out in a moment.
###417 Are you having any pain?
###421 Deltan women experience childbirth as another kind of orgasm.
###425 We feel far more pleasure in it than pain.
###428 Lucky you.
###429 Indeed.
###431 [DOOR OPENS]
###435 MCCOY: What the hell are you doing here?
###437 Captain's orders, sir.
###442 McCoy to Kirk.
###443 [over com]: Kirk here.
###445 Damn it, Jim, can't we let this women have her child in peace?
###448 A security officer's presence is normal procedure--
###451 --under these abnormal circumstances, Bones.
###453 Now you can't tell me that a new born infant--
###455 --seriously poses any kind of danger to the security of this vessel.
###459 Bones....
###459 MCCOY: I won't have it.
###461 This is my Sickbay and I won't have this baby born--
###463 --with a phaser pointed at its head!
###465 Nobody is pointing any phasers, Doctor.
###467 It's unwarranted, Captain.
###468 And it compromises the best care I can provide to my patients.
###472 KIRK: Ensign Kirk---
###473 Please take up your position in the corridor outside of Sickbay.
###476 Aye, sir.
###481 Thank you, Doctor.
###491 KIRK: Mr Chekov...
###493 Can you monitor this baby from here, once it's been born?
###497 Captain, given the bond between a Deltan mother and child...
###500 I feel that Ensign Isel would notice.
###503 Just the same--
###504 I'd like you to monitor this as an intruder around the clock.
###507 Sir, it's a baby!
###509 Well unless we can determine otherwise...
###510 This is an intruder masquerading as a baby.
###513 Indeed, considering the human instinct to trust and nurture an infant--
###517 --An intruder could not choose a more perfect form.
###519 It's not just human nature we are talking about here--
###522 --It's Deltan nature as well.
###524 Deltan mothers are the most fiercely protective in the galaxy.
###527 I'm pretty sure that's why this entity chose her.
###530 Captain, any species selecting a surrogate mother--
###532 --would naturally select the most protective one.
###534 The choice does not necessarily mean the entity is malevolent.
###538 Well, it doesn't guarantee that it's not, either.
###541 What it does guarantee is that--
###542 I'm going to be making some pretty unpopular decisions on this ship,
###546 Until we can determine whether or not this really is a threat.
###552 She's coming now, Doctor.
###573 [MAGICAL STING]
###599 MCCOY: Well, you were right...
###600 ...It was an easy delivery.
###602 Deltans always know. You needn't have worried...
###606 Now don't patronize me young lady.
###608 You know this was no ordinary delivery.
###610 She never pretended it was, Doctor.
###616 Have you thought of a name?
###618 Irska.
###619 After the baby's father.
###622 After it's father?!
###624 Her father.
###625 Irska means 'pure light' in Deltan.
###632 [SINGING]
###645 Sir, it's just a baby.
###650 I wouldn't call immaculate conception, after a three day pregnancy, "normal".
###655 Then what's to become of it?
###664 [BOSUN WHISTLE]
###666 Kirk here.
###667 MCCOY: Jim, I just did a complete scan of Isel's baby...
###672 You'd better get down here.
###673 I'm on my way, Doctor.
###674 Mr Spock, you have the conn.
###684 What do you have for me, Bones?
###687 Well, the child checks out as human in almost every respect.
###690 No Deltan characteristics?
###692 None that I can detect.
###694 Well how the hell can that be?
###695 I don't know.
###696 What's even more incredible is how fast she's growing--
###699 --even faster now than in Isel's womb.
###701 By human standards, she's growing a little more than a year per day.
###706 Her metabolism is normal which, in theory, means she can't possibly be processing--
###710 --enough food to account for the rate of growth we're observing.
###713 What would happen if I had them separated now?
###715 No you can't do that, Jim.
###717 For one thing, Isel would stop at nothing to get her back.
###720 That child could pose a threat to this ship
###722 in ways that we can't even imagine.
###724 No matter how much Isel loves that child,
###726 That child was put inside her by an unknown alien
###728 For an unknown reason.
###730 Well it may be unusual, but it's not altogether unheard of for species--
###734 --to reproduce by depositing their eggs in an unsuspecting host.
###737 Exactly--
###738 And in almost every case--
###740 That life form it's reproducing is almost always a parasite.
###744 Let me see if I can set your mind at ease.
###746 There's something else I haven't told you about Isel's baby...
###750 I don't think she's going to live out the week.
###752 Why not?
###753 She was born with an abnormally high white blood cell count--
###755 --and it's steadily increasing...
###757 She has leukaemia.
###759 And from all my studies--
###760 --I don't believe she is going to respond to any known form of treatment.
###764 [SPOCK OVER INTERCOM] Captain Kirk, please report to the bridge.,
###766 We have an alien object approaching
###769 2500 Km and closing.
###771 Acknowledged, Mr Spock. I'll be there momentarily.
###773 Go to yellow alert.
###778 Does Isel know?
###780 Not yet.
###782 Use your discretion, Bones.
###795 Any sign of hostility, Mr Chekov?
###798 No, sir.
###800 Sensor readings, Mr Spock?
###802 No known life forms.
###807 You're hedging your bets, Spock.
###808 You think there's something inside that thing?
###810 Sensors indicate only a hollow tri-tritanium shell--
###813 --surrounding a field of what could be "Dark Light".
###816 "Dark Light"?
###817 Analogous to "Dark Matter", Captain.
###819 It seems to possess the energy of photons--
###821 --but without the detectable wavelengths.
###823 There appeared to be some in that cloud that we encountered four nights ago.
###827 The night Isel's child was conceived...
###828 Precisely.
###829 But it is far more concentrated inside the cylinder.
###833 The shell exactly duplicates the alloy of our hull.
###835 Well that's no coincidence, Spock--
###837 Somebody's making a point about our technology.
###839 Perhaps.
###840 Sensors show no signs of machinery on board of any kind--
###843 --Yet it appears to have no difficulty paralleling our course.
###846 Well how can that be?
###847 It cannot be.
###848 Logic dictates there is a controlling lifeform that our sensors are failing to detect.
###853 Lieutenant, hailing frequencies open.
###856 Hailing frequencies open, Sir.
###858 This is Captain James T. Kirk of the Starship Enterprise.
###861 Identify yourself and your intentions.
###867 No response, sir.
###869 It seems safe to assume there's a connection--
###871 --between the object and Isel's child, Captain.
###874 Well, we still don't know who's behind all this, Spock.
###877 For all we know, it could be Isel's child causing this.
###879 It has made no hostile gestures, sir.
###881 Scan it again Mr Spock.
###883 This time a little more aggressively.
###885 If it thinks we are trying to scan it, maybe it'll take the time to contact us.
###889 I want to know what the hell I'm dealing with
###893 Before I have to do anything about it.
###897 Mother.
###902 Irska.
###911 Mother.
###915 Irska.
###921 [ECHOING] Mother.
###925 [ECHOING] Irska.
###930 [DRAMATIC FANFARE]
###934 KIRK: Captain's Log, Stardate 9717.7
###937 A week has passed since the birth of Isel's child
###940 and the appearance of the strange alien cylinder.
###942 Despite an ever increasing white blood cell count,
###945 Irska remains healthy.
###946 Her stage of development is now roughly that of a ten-year-old child.
###950 We remain unable to make contact with the alien cylinder
###954 or to determine why, or even how, it is following us.
###959 Today I resume my duties.
###961 That means we'll be apart for a time.
###964 Can't I work with you?
###965 No. My work is my work.
###968 It's important now for you to spend time alone
###970 To become what you are to be.
###972 But, what will I do?
###974 Whatever you want. Learn. Discover joyfulness alone.
###978 Once you achieve that, you need never fear rejection.
###987 [DOOR BUZZ]
###989 Come.
###994 I would like permission to resume my duties, Captain.
###997 And what about your daughter?
###999 She's busy learning to have a good relationship.
###1002 With whom?
###1004 Herself.
###1006 She must be alone and get to know herself before sharing herself with others.
###1010 Isel, have you made any plans for you and your daughter?
###1013 Plans?
###1016 I must love her.
###1017 Teach her what I can.
###1019 --and let her go.
###1020 Go? Go where?
###1022 To do what?
###1024 Appearances to the contrary, she's not human--
###1027 and she's not Deltan - nor is she any other race that we're familiar with.
###1032 Do you really think she can adjust to that kind of aloneness?
###1036 Captain, she is my child.
###1037 Even if we are physically separated--
###1040 the bond between us is inseparable.
###1043 Where she goes and what she does must be left up to her.
###1047 And what if she were to pose some kind of danger?
###1048 She does not - could not pose danger to anyone.
###1052 Do you have any idea whether or not she's connected to that cylinder out there?
###1057 No. None at all. I'm sorry.
###1061 Very well, Ensign, thank you.
###1064 You can return to duty now.
###1066 Thank you, sir.
###1079 ISEL: You are relieved, Mr Chekov.
###1080 Thanks for taking over for me.
###1082 It was my pleasure.
###1086 And how is the beautiful Irska today?
###1089 She's just marvellous.
###1095 Something is being beamed aboard from the alien cylinder.
###1098 It's roughly one cubic centimetre of "dark light" atmosphere--
###1103 --contained in the cylinder
###1105 Find it and isolate it.
###1111 It is in our number ten filter--
###1114 --of our atmospheric purification system.
###1121 We've isolated the filter and are redirecting the air flow.
###1132 What's the problem, Spock?
###1134 A small quantity of "dark light" was beamed into our filtration system.
###1137 Lt Chekov contained it as quickly as possible.
###1140 However, it is an extreme biotoxin and--
###1144 we were exposed to a lethal dose 2.3 seconds after it arrived.
###1148 Unless Dr. McCoy can counteract it within 6.2 hours, it will kill us all.
###1158 [TELEPATHIC SIGNAL]
###1164 KIRK: Captain's log, supplemental.
###1166 It has now been more than four hours--
###1168 --Since the alien craft beamed a deadly--
###1170 portion of its atmosphere into our ship.
###1172 So far, Dr. McCoy has made little progress
###1174 toward finding a cure for its effects.
###1178 The crew is already displaying symptoms of the "dark light" toxin
###1181  and though they continue to maintain the ship's routine--
###1184 Many of them have become despondent--
###1186 --hopeless.
###1192 Which one is this?
###1193 NK-one-seven platelets with monocyte serum.
###1200 Any luck?
###1203 Worthless.
###1205 Next.
###1207 [BAGPIPE MUSIC PLAYS]
###1218 I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you...
###1220 It's all right, lass.
###1222 Aren't you with your mother?
###1224 She's at the bridge and Captain Kirk doesn't like me to be there.
###1228 So you came to see old Mr Scott?
###1231 You know, you're the only wee lass I've ever known--
###1235 --who could see the beauty in engineering schematics.
###1239 I see beauty in almost everything, Mr Scott.
###1242 I've got a present for you.
###1244 It's like your mother's.
###1248 Oh, Mr Scott.
###1249 It's beautiful.
###1251 Thank you!
###1262 Is it possible that they are being remotely controlled, somehow?
###1265 If that is the case, then it is being done from a greater distance--
###1268 --than our long range scanners can detect.
###1271 Well, something moved the "Dark Light" into our air supply.
###1275 There must be an intelligent life form behind all of this.
###1278 I'm convinced that they know what they are doing to us.
###1281 Possibly. Or, it could be studying us, learning how the toxins affects us.
###1286 If it simply wanted to kill us--
###1287 --I suspect it could do so far more efficiently.
###1292 That's comforting.
###1293 Really?
###1294 No, Mr Xon. Not really.
###1304 Bones, progress report?
###1306 MCCOY: None. The toxin makes changes to the proteins in our cells that I can't begin to understand.
###1311 I'm just flying blind, hoping to get lucky, Jim.
###1313 We've got less than two hours.
###1316 Doctor, when was the last time you examined Irska?
###1318 Damn it, Spock! I don't have time to do a complete physical.
###1321 I'm trying to create a vaccine.
###1323 If she and the object are, in fact, connected--
###1325 --then Irska could provide a key to counteracting the toxin.
###1328 Fine. Then send her down.
###1330 I can't do any worse than I'm doing now.
###1333 Captain, if this is absolutely necessary, I'd like to be with her for the examination.
###1338 I don't want her to be frightened or to think she's done something wrong.
###1341 You can't interfere with what the doctor has planned.
###1343 I understand.
###1345 Get her to sickbay. Fast.
###1352 [DOORS OPEN]
###1358 [MCCOY COUGHS]
###1359 Bring her here.
###1386 [DOOR BUZZ]
###1396 [DOOR BUZZ TWICE]
###1398 Come.
###1404 I thought you wanted to stay with your daughter.
###1411 She knew I would feel any pain that she felt--
###1413 --and that my pain would be greater than hers.
###1415 Won't you feel it just as much here?
###1417 Only if I focus on it, and she asked me not to.
###1421 She felt it would make the process more difficult for her.
###1425 I'm sorry that all this was necessary.
###1439 Why did you do that?
###1440 To make a connection.
###1442 A sexual connection?
###1445 I'm Deltan.
###1446 Any meaningful contact between us will feel sexual to you.
###1450 And you think you can use that to influence me.
###1453 Captain, do you know why Deltans agree to take oaths of celibacy?
###1457 Because Starfleet requires you to.
###1459 Beyond that.
###1461 We live to connect as deeply as possible with other beings.
###1464 Putting a limit on our ability to do so--
###1466 --heightens all our senses to compensate for what we're missing.
###1470 So, the process of being less Deltan makes us even more Deltan.
###1474 So what's your point, Ensign?
###1476 The only bond stronger than that between Deltan lovers
###1479 is the bond between a Deltan mother and her child.
###1483 You felt a powerful connection when I touched you
###1486 --but my bond with Irska is infinitely deeper.
###1489 I can sense all her feelings...
###1491 even the difference between how a food tastes to me--
###1493 --and how it tastes to her.
###1496 I hoped that my touch would help you to understand--
###1498 --how I can know that my daughter is no threat to this ship.
###1503 Well, that cylinder attacked this ship and poisoned our air--
###1506 --and you know they are connected somehow.
###1508 She feels a connection, but has no sense of its nature.
###1513 Attacking that cylinder could harm Irska.
###1516 That's why you're here...
###1520 My daughter is innocent.
###1521 I would know if she were not.
###1524 She is not responsible for what the cylinder does.
###1528 Well the evidence suggests that, she may not be directing it--
###1532 --but it probably wouldn't be here otherwise.
###1535 [DOOR BUZZ]
###1537 Come.
###1540 Well, I've deployed medics to all decks dispensing injections.
###1543 I thought you'd like yours as soon as possible.
###1546 Bones!  You found a cure!
###1548 Dr. McCoy taught me all about life and death.
###1553 Well, Thank my young assistant here.
###1555 She had the cure inside of her a week before we needed it.
###1558 Those strange white corpuscles of hers adapted to the toxin and neutralized it.
###1563 Has she been affected in any other way?
###1565 Just her miraculous blood adaptation.
###1567 [KLAXON & BOSUN WHISTLE]
###1569 SPOCK: Captain, our hull is being penetrated by an energy beam of unknown nature--
###1573 from the alien cylinder. Shields are ineffective.
###1575 I'm on my way.
###1581 [DRAMATIC STING]
###1595 KIRK: Damage report, Mr Sulu.
###1597 Alien energy beam is focused on impulse engine
###1599 --plasma cooling unit 2, the coil and shutdown servos.
###1603 Evasive manoeuvres.
###1604 ISEL: Impulse engine plasma is overheating, Captain.
###1606 Lock phasers on target.
###1608 Locked on target, sir.
###1614 Captain, the alien has disengaged its energy beam.
###1618 Hold your fire, Mr Sulu.
###1620 Why did they stop?
###1621 I believe the attack was disengaged because it has completed its goal
###1625 Our impulse engine plasma cooling coil has ruptured.
###1628 The attack was broken off at the exact instant the rupture occurred.
###1632 Why would they do that, Mr Spock?
###1633 What point does it serve?
###1635 Unknown, Captain.
###1636 [BOSUN WHISTLE]
###1637 SCOTTY: We've got a mess down here, Captain.
###1639 The impulse engines are spewing out plasma and we can't shut them down.
###1643 Ensign Hemmings is in there, trying to get a better look.
###1645 Keep me posted, Mr Scott.
###1658 Well as always, that green blood of yours proved--
###1661 --to be a particular pain in my posterior.
###1670 IRSKA: Look, there's a leak in the number 2 cooling coil.
###1673 Yes, we know.
###1675 You have to fix it or the impulse engine will explode.
###1678 [DRAMATIC STING]
###1681 How did you know that?
###1682 Mr Scott showed me all the technical manuals.
###1694 Medical team to engineering!
###1695 Lt Ross has taken a massive dose of theta radiation.
###1699 Captain, the automatic systems failed.
###1701 I've sealed the tube manually for now
###1703 But the leak is releasing pure theta ionized plasma.
###1706 Can you stop it?
###1707 Our only hope is to patch the coil.
###1709 One man could weld the patch in about 15 minutes.
###1712 Captain, theta radiation in the access tube is too intense.
###1716 Even with a protective suit--
###1717 No one could remain conscious in there for more than a few minutes.
###1720 Get down there. See if you can lend a hand.
###1722 Sulu, How much time do we have?
###1724 89 minutes.
###1725 She's right, Captain.
###1726 Stay on it, Mr Scott.
###1729 Young lady, you'll have to come with me.
###1731 But can't I-- --Oww!
###1735 I'm sorry.
###1737 I need you to come with me, please.
###1742 You too, Mr Spock.
###1750 The theta plasma levels are in red zone proximity.
###1753 Keep the exhaust manifolds on full or I'm a dead man.
###1756 Aye, sir.
###1765 I'm considering a mind meld.
###1767 I don't think it would work, Captain.
###1769 Isel would sense it instantly--
###1771 --and I would be flooded with her feelings as well.
###1775 What's a "mind meld"?
###1779 Great.  Deltan sensitivity and ears like a Vulcan.
###1789 A mind meld is a technique that would let us share each other's thoughts.
###1792 I'd like that.
###1793 Yes, I'd like that, too.
###1795 But now is not the time.
###1797 Your mother has the ability to sense aspects of things--
###1800 --that she can't see or touch. Can you do this, as well?
###1802 Yes, I think so.
###1804 Can you try for me?
###1805 Can you try very hard?
###1807 Are you able to sense anything about this cylinder that's following this ship?
###1813 [COUGHING]
###1819 Mr Scott is dying! I have to help him!
###1822 ISEL: No!!!
###1823 Isel... What's wrong?
###1825 [BOSUN WHISTLE]
###1826 KIRK: Dr. McCoy to the briefing room.
###1833 MILLER: Send a medical team, Mr Scott is down.
###1840 Jim, I should see to Scotty.
###1842 In a minute, Bones.
###1845 I need to know if Irska's blood will adapt to the theta radiation.
###1849 It's possible...
###1850 It can.  I know it can!
###1853 You cannot allow this! I won't allow it.
###1856 She's just a child!
###1860 I want to. I can save the ship and Mr Scott!
###1863 That's not your job.
###1865 Yes, it is!
###1865 If I fix the leak my blood will adapt to the theta radiation--
###1868 --and Dr. McCoy can use it to save Mr Scott, just like last time.
###1873 Sweetheart, we don't know that your blood will adapt again.
###1876 She's right, we can't know for sure.
###1879 However, Ensign--
###1880 I believe it's highly likely her blood will adapt as needed.
###1884 You may be willing to risk my daughter's life on "highly likely"
###1887 --But I am not.
###1888 Ensign, the impulse engines will explode, inside of an hour, if we don't fix that leak.
###1892 All of our lives are at risk,
###1895 Your daughter is the only person capable of staying conscious--
###1898 --long enough inside that tube to fix it.
###1900 You don't know she can stay conscious in there.
###1902 We know that nobody else can.
###1904 Mommy, Mr Scott is my friend. I don't want him to die. Please.
###1914 We need to get that suit off him.
###1916 Get Dr. McCoy down here now.
###1920 Decker to Captain.
###1921 Kirk here, how's Scotty?
###1923 Critical.
###1924 McCoy is on his way. I'll be on the bridge.
###1928 I should be going.
###1931 Despite my fear--
###1933 I cherish that you have learned to love others--
###1936 --so much that you want to do this.
###1938 I'll be alright, mother, really.
###1958 Any activity from the cylinder, Mr Sulu?
###1960 None, sir.
###1962 How long until impulse engine meltdown?
###1964 Twenty minutes, sir.
###1975 Mr Scott already applied the patch to the leak,
###1977 so all you have to do is use this torch--
###1979 --along the edges of the patch to seal it.
###1982 It's operated by...
###1983 Mr Scott showed me yesterday. You just press this button.
###1986 The edges of the seal will change colour from red to blue as it seals--
###1991 --and the gas should stop escaping.
###1993 Don't worry. I can do it.
###1994 Alright, let's go.
###2003 Well, there's nothing more we can do.
###2006 We can only hope that Irska's blood will adapt to the theta radiation.
###2010 I can start preparing a medium for the serum right now, Doctor.
###2013 We might as well be ready.
###2016 Do it. I'll be on the bridge.
###2024 [COMM CHIRP]
###2026 PETER: We're ready.
###2027 [FORCEFIELD DEACTIVATES]
###2049 I'm here. I see the patch.
###2075 Remember to keep the torch in place until the red line turns blue--
###2078 --then move it to the next bit of red.
###2081 I will.
###2097 How long has she been in there?
###2099 3.2 minutes longer than Mr Scott
###2102 Well, that's a good sign
###2103 The pattern of recent events indicates she will succeed in her task--
###2107 --and suffer no ill effects from the radiation, Doctor.
###2110 However, the same pattern dictates a new crisis--
###2114 --will follow swiftly upon resolution of this one.
###2117 No life form in the galaxy--
###2119 --can spoil good news faster than your average Vulcan.
###2124 I may as well head back to sickbay and start getting ready.
###2129 Captain, I suggest a mind meld with Irska.
###2133 Her subconscious may well hold the reason for these consecutive crises.
###2137 I mentioned that earlier to Spock and he thought--
###2138 --the child's connection to her mother would make it unlikely to succeed.
###2141 For him, perhaps.
###2144 Mr Spock has struggled his entire life to suppress emotion.
###2146 For me, it is effortless. I would have less chance of being overwhelmed.
###2150 Are you saying this could be more dangerous than usual?
###2152 Undoubtedly, but I suspect the risk will be necessary.
###2156 Let's hope not.
###2157 For now, we have more pressing matters to deal with.
###2160 How much time do we have, Mr Chekov?
###2161 Four minutes, Captain.
###2167 Engineering, stand by to recharge impulse engine coolers on my command.
###2170 Aye, Captain.
###2172 You have to work quickly, Irska.
###2177 One minute to impulse engine meltdown.
###2188 Engineering! Recharge impulse engine coolers now!
###2191 Recharging, sir. Plasma levels are returning to nominal.
###2193 Impulse engine temperature is coming down, Captain.
###2196 Ensign Kirk, escort Irska to sickbay on the double.
###2199 Captain, I think the alien object is attacking us again.
###2203 You think? What's it doing?
###2205 I don't know, Captain, but--
###2207 --something is affecting the integrity of our hull.
###2209 On screen, now.
###2216 There is no apparent energy being applied to us--
###2218 --but somehow the atoms of our hull
###2220 are being manipulated below the quantum level.
###2222 Is the object causing it?
###2223 Unknown, sir.
###2224 But the object is experiencing the same effect.
###2226 Evasive manoeuvres, Mr Sulu. Take us away from it.
###2245 Anti-matter imbalance, Captain. Warp drive engines shutting down!
###2249 What the hell is going on?
###2251 I can only estimate--
###2253 --but if the manipulation continues at the present rate--
###2255 --our ship's hull will cease to exist in something less than 14 minutes.
###2259 Mr Spock, take the conn. Mr Xon, you're with me.
###2267 You, my dear, have the most amazing blood any doctor has ever encountered.
###2272 With you around, I could cure just about anything.
###2275 I have the medium all ready. I will have the serum in no time.
###2286 I need Mr Xon to mind meld with your daughter. Now.
###2288 Is that wise? Melding with her melds with me and everyone close to me.
###2292 Wise or not, it's the only way I'm going to understand the threat to this ship.
###2296 Irska?
###2298 I'd be happy to join minds with Mr Xon.
###2300 Wouldn't it be funny if we taught him how to laugh?
###2304 Very funny, darling.
###2309 My mind to your mind...
###2313 Your thoughts to my thoughts...
###2332 [DRAMATIC STING]
###2337 KIRK: Captain's log, supplemental. An unknown entity--
###2339 --believed connected to Isel's mysterious daughter--
###2342 is poised to destroy our ship in less than 12 minutes.
###2345 Lt Xon, our best chance to understand this entity's motives--
###2349 --lies unconscious in sickbay.
###2351 MCCOY: I can try but it could just as easily kill him.
###2356 SPOCK: There is another way.
###2357 KIRK: No, Spock!
###2359 I can't risk losing you both.
###2361 Lt Xon is no longer in contact with Isel and Irska.
###2364 Whatever shock resulting from that contact, has already processed.
###2369 I would be melding Vulcan to Vulcan, which essentially should be safe.
###2374 Bones?
###2375 Well, "should be safe" isn't the same as "safe"--
###2378 --and there's no way I can predict the risk.
###2381 I mean, I consider it a small miracle if I can cure a Vulcan of a headache.
###2384 Vulcans do not get headaches, Doctor.
###2388 I rest my case.
###2393 Do it, Spock.
###2397 [MEDICAL TRICORDER OPERATING]
###2408 Spock! ... Spock!
###2411 Bones, give him a shot. Get him out of it.
###2416 Spock--
###2417 What happened?
###2420 I was overwhelmed with a sensation--
###2425 A sense of connection--
###2428 --unlike any I've known.
###2433 It was intoxicating.
###2437 Perhaps it was Deltan love--
###2439 --Perhaps it was from the alien entity.
###2448 I do not know.
###2450 Did you find any connection between Irska and the entity?
###2455 Only one word, sir--
###2457 "Cryontha"
###2458 "Cryontha" [ECHOING IN SPACE]
###2462 "Cryontha"? What does it mean?
###2466 Unknown, sir.
###2475 Mr Spock--
###2476 -- use the ship's computer and run a search for the word "cryontha"
###2479 Acknowledged.
###2480 Lieutenant, broadcast "cryontha" to the alien cylinder on all frequencies.
###2484 Broadcasting....
###2485 Mr Kirk, lock phasers on the alien cylinder.
###2488 Arming phasers. Locking on target.
###2491 No response, sir.
###2493 If they won't respond to one kind of communication--
###2496 --Maybe they'll respond to another.
###2499 Fire.
###2501 [PHASERS FIRE]
###2506 [IRSKA CRIES]
###2507 ISEL: Stop it, Captain! Stop it, now!
###2509 Cease fire.
###2514 I'm sorry.
###2516 I didn't want to hurt you.
###2525 You realize this proves the connection between your daughter and the entity.
###2528 What do you intend to do, Captain?
###2530 I don't know--
###2532 --but I am not going to let this ship be destroyed without a fight.
###2535 SPOCK: Captain. I've found a reference to "cryontha".
###2539 It was prominent in hieroglyphs found in ruins of an advanced civilization
###2543 on a planet abandoned by its inhabitants--
###2546 --over 100 million years ago.
###2548 What does it mean, Spock?
###2549 The translation is believed to be--
###2552 "Unnecessary Shell"
###2554 "Unnecessary shell"?
###2556 There may be a connection, Captain, as the planet is located--
###2559 --not far from where Isel was impregnated.
###2565 Irska?
###2566 Does "unnecessary shell" mean anything to you?
###2569 No, sir.
###2571 Think hard.
###2573 Think very hard.
###2574 "Cryontha"
###2576 "Unnecessary shell."
###2583 Did you think of something?
###2586 I don't know.
###2588 I don't think so.
###2590 Ensign Isel, hold your daughter.
###2592 What are you going to do?
###2593 Look! The phasers didn't do anything!
###2595 They sent a message. I have no choice but to send it back.
###2599 Mr Kirk, fire phasers.
###2601 NO!!
###2607 Mommy!!!
###2609 Mommy!!!
###2612 Security team to the bridge.
###2615 Your mother's going to be all right.
###2620 COMPUTER: Hull integrity compromised.
###2622 Total hull failure will occur in seven minutes.
###2624 Shut that damn thing off!
###2631 Take Ensign Isel and her daughter to their quarters--
###2633 --and see to it that they stay there.
###2650 Phaser and photon torpedo controls are both out, Captain.
###2653 Go to auxiliary.
###2655 Captain, Isel was right. Despite the pain to the child--
###2658 --the alien cylinder experienced no damage.
###2661 I believe additional firing will only hurt only the child.
###2691 No need to be frightened. You've only felt pain.
###2695 Why must anyone feel pain?
###2698 It's part of life. Sometimes it's how we understand.
###2702 Can you make me understand... what "cryontha" is?
###2706 It's inside your mind. Only you can find it.
###2709 And if I don't, everyone will die?
###2711 Don't use your mind to feel guilt.
###2714 Ask yourself what cryontha is, and just let the answer come...
###2719 But Mr Spock said it meant "unnecessary shell".
###2723 That's what it means to him. Discover what it means to you.
###2735 Mr Spock, how much time?
###2737 Approximately 5 minutes, Captain.
###2740 Metallurgy, report.
###2741 No progress on a catalysing agent, Captain.
###2745 Physics lab, report.
###2746 We've tried reverse gravity and a battery of magnetic field generators. No effect, sir.
###2751 Bones, what's your status?
###2752 All theta radiation patients have responded to treatment, Jim
###2755 and Nurse Natal is on her way to the bridge with Mr Xon.
###2762 The minute he regained consciousness he insisted on coming up here.
###2774 Are you alright, Mr Xon?
###2776 The Deltan impressions were stronger than I anticipated, but I will recover.
###2781 What you must know is that each of the calamities that befell our ship--
###2784 --was intended to teach Irska something about life, death,
###2787 and emotions I could not comprehend.
###2790 Irska feels incomplete, but does not know why.
###2794 Well, what about cryontha? What is cryontha?
###2797 I do not know--
###2799 --but I believe it to be the key to her next stage of development.
###2809 NO! I'm not ready to lose you.
###2813 You can never lose me. That's why you were chosen.
###2817 But I will lose this...
###2821 And this...
###2824 We will touch in other ways.
###2827 I know.  We must hurry...
###2838 Spock, what's going on?
###2840 Unknown, Captain, but quantum manipulation of the atoms--
###2842 --in our hull is no longer synchronized with those of the cylinder.
###2845 [BOSUN WHISTLE]
###2846 All decks!  This is security.
###2848 Ensign Isel and her daughter have escaped from their quarters.
###2850 Scanning all decks, Captain.
###2852 I have them.
###2854 Ensign Kirk, get to the transporter room on the double and detain them.
###2857 Spock, your with me.
###2862 IRSKA: Let her go!
###2863 The "unnecessary shell" is my body!
###2872 Captain...
###2877 No!
###2878 [PHASER FIRE]
###2881 [ENERGISING]
###2883 [TRANSPORTER DEMATERILIZATION]
###2893 Forgive me, Jim.
###2895 There was no time to explain.
###2901 Where did you send her?
###2904 She sent Irska into the cylinder.
###2909 You killed her?
###2911 No, Captain--
###2915 --Her body was the "unnecessary shell".
###2919 She learned to let it go.
###2920 [BOSUN WHISTLE]
###2921 CHEKOV: The alien cylinder has vanished, Captain.
###2924 Our hull has returned to normal.
###2927 Stand down from red alert, Mr Chekov.
###2932 You're all right with this?
###2935 Thousands of centuries ago, Irska's race existed in human form.
###2940 Just as humans pass through all evolutionary stages--
###2942 --from single cell to human being within the mother's womb.
###2947 Irska had to experience all stages of her race's prior development.
###2952 So what you are saying is that, Irska, hasn't even really been born, yet?
###2956 Until she had experienced all joys and pains of living in a body
###2961 and was ready to shed the 'unnecessary shell'--
###2963 --it represented to her, she was still in an embryonic state for her race.
###2968 I was her first womb.
###2970 The Enterprise was her second.
###3028 I wish her life with you could have been longer,
###3032 and wish there was some way I could have made it easier for both of you.
###3036 Thank you, Captain.
###3038 I appreciate your sentiments, but only our physical connection has been broken.
###3044 Besides--
###3046 I hardly expect you to make improvements on a miracle.
