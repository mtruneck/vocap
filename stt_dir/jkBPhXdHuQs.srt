0:0:4,92 --> 0:0:7,342
CHARLET DUBOC: Welcome to
"Fashion Week Internationale,"


3
0:0:7,342 --> 0:0:10,41
the show that reports on the
most fabulous fashion weeks in


4
0:0:10,41 --> 0:0:14,47
the world, and the culture
and politics behind them.


5
0:0:14,47 --> 0:0:17,847
This time, we take you down
south to Atlanta, Georgia.


6
0:0:17,847 --> 0:0:25,4



7
0:0:25,4 --> 0:0:27,9
-What a coincidence that you're
here for Urban Fashion


8
0:0:27,9 --> 0:0:30,565
Week, and all I know
is fashion.


9
0:0:30,565 --> 0:0:33,45
Every day I wake up it's like
a fashion statement.


10
0:0:33,45 --> 0:0:35,79
I wear army fatigue pants.


11
0:0:35,79 --> 0:0:38,4
That's because I'm a soldier,
you hear me?


12
0:0:38,4 --> 0:0:40,35
CHARLET DUBOC: When you say
"soldier," I know you don't


13
0:0:40,35 --> 0:0:41,72
mean it in a military sense.


14
0:0:41,72 --> 0:0:43,38
You're not in the army, right?


15
0:0:43,38 --> 0:0:45,56
-It's not necessarily
a war, like I'm


16
0:0:45,56 --> 0:0:47,4
going to kill somebody.


17
0:0:47,4 --> 0:0:50,26
But it's a war against trying
to better myself every day.


18
0:0:50,26 --> 0:0:53,65
So at the end of the day, I'm
struggling, and I'm fighting a


19
0:0:53,65 --> 0:0:57,474
war against my haters and my
doubters, to show them that


20
0:0:57,474 --> 0:0:59,919
they ain't going to
stop me, never.


21
0:0:59,919 --> 0:1:4,33
[MUSIC PLAYING]


22
0:1:4,33 --> 0:1:7,0
CHARLET DUBOC: In the last few
years, the city of Atlanta has


23
0:1:7,0 --> 0:1:8,9
reinvented itself as one of the


24
0:1:8,9 --> 0:1:10,658
entertainment capitals of America.


25
0:1:10,658 --> 0:1:13,183



26
0:1:13,183 --> 0:1:16,35
With massive home-grown artists
such as Outkast,


27
0:1:16,35 --> 0:1:20,716
Ludacris, Waka Flocka Flame,
and Gucci Mane, all paying


28
0:1:20,716 --> 0:1:23,96
homage to their city's
inimitable southern charm and


29
0:1:23,96 --> 0:1:26,46
titillating nightlife.


30
0:1:26,46 --> 0:1:29,97
We had come here to meet a man
called Billy Bad Ass as he


31
0:1:29,97 --> 0:1:33,21
prepared to bring his Urban
Fashion Week franchise to


32
0:1:33,21 --> 0:1:36,4
London, bringing some
Atlanta style to the


33
0:1:36,4 --> 0:1:37,29
prim English streets.


34
0:1:37,29 --> 0:1:44,9



35
0:1:44,9 --> 0:1:47,55
[MUSIC PLAYING]


36
0:1:47,55 --> 0:1:50,2
CHARLET DUBOC: Billy had lined
up a week of urban fashion


37
0:1:50,2 --> 0:1:53,25
delights in Atlanta, and I
couldn't wait to live out my


38
0:1:53,25 --> 0:1:58,175
music video fantasies with
Billy as my guide.


39
0:1:58,175 --> 0:2:1,91
We met Billy at a casting call
to select some aspiring models


40
0:2:1,91 --> 0:2:4,4
to take to London, some
of whom had flown in


41
0:2:4,4 --> 0:2:8,1
from as far as Kansas.


42
0:2:8,1 --> 0:2:8,59
Billy.


43
0:2:8,59 --> 0:2:9,8
BILLY BAD ASS: Yeah.


44
0:2:9,8 --> 0:2:10,6
CHARLET DUBOC: Thanks
for having us.


45
0:2:10,6 --> 0:2:12,4
BILLY BAD ASS: You're right
here at the spot.


46
0:2:12,4 --> 0:2:16,67
First time we've started out our
interviews for the models.


47
0:2:16,67 --> 0:2:18,4
We're trying to select one
model to go to London.


48
0:2:18,4 --> 0:2:21,285
So we getting it going.


49
0:2:21,285 --> 0:2:22,98
Let me tell you a little bit
about what's going on.


50
0:2:22,98 --> 0:2:26,45
We're going to actually select
probably one, or maybe two


51
0:2:26,45 --> 0:2:28,24
models, to go to London.


52
0:2:28,24 --> 0:2:31,34
We take care of your hotel,
your partying.


53
0:2:31,34 --> 0:2:33,682
White party, black party,
whatever parties you're going


54
0:2:33,682 --> 0:2:35,7
to have up there.


55
0:2:35,7 --> 0:2:38,19
You'll be able to eat for
free and just kind of


56
0:2:38,19 --> 0:2:41,85
hang out, on me.


57
0:2:41,85 --> 0:2:44,8
CHARLET DUBOC: Before getting
down to the casting process,


58
0:2:44,8 --> 0:2:45,83
Billy wanted to introduce
me to some of


59
0:2:45,83 --> 0:2:48,11
his assembled entourage.


60
0:2:48,11 --> 0:2:51,5
He'd invited along the
first and only black


61
0:2:51,5 --> 0:2:53,59
female NASCAR driver.


62
0:2:53,59 --> 0:2:54,19
BILLY BAD ASS: This is Tia.


63
0:2:54,19 --> 0:2:56,63
She's a NASCAR driver.


64
0:2:56,63 --> 0:3:0,2
I think she's going to be very
instrumental in helping a lot


65
0:3:0,2 --> 0:3:2,31
of young ladies get out
of the stereotype


66
0:3:2,31 --> 0:3:5,49
that they can't drive.


67
0:3:5,49 --> 0:3:8,54
CHARLET DUBOC: Then there was
the African business investor.


68
0:3:8,54 --> 0:3:10,48
KENNY: What I love about him
is his thinking and his


69
0:3:10,48 --> 0:3:12,41
innovative capability.


70
0:3:12,41 --> 0:3:14,87
He thinks of things outside
of the box.


71
0:3:14,87 --> 0:3:16,183
BILLY BAD ASS: I'm actually
trying to build


72
0:3:16,183 --> 0:3:17,68
my own fashion car.


73
0:3:17,68 --> 0:3:23,15
Body make, engine, tires,
everything is fashion.


74
0:3:23,15 --> 0:3:24,5
And that's not being done yet.


75
0:3:24,5 --> 0:3:27,233
CHARLET DUBOC: And an
environmental officer from Fox


76
0:3:27,233 --> 0:3:28,2
Entertainment.


77
0:3:28,2 --> 0:3:30,33
BILLY BAD ASS: I think urban and
eco needs to get together.


78
0:3:30,33 --> 0:3:31,57
FELICIA PHILLIPS: That's
exactly right.


79
0:3:31,57 --> 0:3:33,5
BILLY BAD ASS: I look like a
fool, but I'm the only one in


80
0:3:33,5 --> 0:3:35,7
my neighborhood with the blue
box out in front of my house


81
0:3:35,7 --> 0:3:36,39
on Fridays.


82
0:3:36,39 --> 0:3:37,89
I'm going to put my
cool shades on.


83
0:3:37,89 --> 0:3:39,9
See, I'm fashion.


84
0:3:39,9 --> 0:3:43,39
I've got to get the Rick
Ross going on, see.


85
0:3:43,39 --> 0:3:45,35
CHARLET DUBOC: Finally, he
got round to directing a


86
0:3:45,35 --> 0:3:46,445
photoshoot.


87
0:3:46,445 --> 0:3:48,73
BILLY BAD ASS: I'm looking for
a girl with a little bit more


88
0:3:48,73 --> 0:3:52,69
booty than a couture model, a
little rump in the trunk.


89
0:3:52,69 --> 0:3:54,8
Mess with that hair.


90
0:3:54,8 --> 0:3:55,19
You've got it all out, now.


91
0:3:55,19 --> 0:3:56,59
You've got to let them see it.


92
0:3:56,59 --> 0:3:57,11
Throw a kiss.


93
0:3:57,11 --> 0:3:57,89
Throw a kiss.


94
0:3:57,89 --> 0:3:58,85
No, no, no.


95
0:3:58,85 --> 0:4:0,41
Throw a kiss like you would
give your boyfriend.


96
0:4:0,41 --> 0:4:1,426
[LAUGHTER]


97
0:4:1,426 --> 0:4:2,78
BILLY BAD ASS: You're throwing
me a kiss like you


98
0:4:2,78 --> 0:4:4,5
would give a wall.


99
0:4:4,5 --> 0:4:5,155
Come one, throw a kiss
like you'd give


100
0:4:5,155 --> 0:4:7,55
your boyfriend a kiss.


101
0:4:7,55 --> 0:4:8,742
Be sincere with something
like aaah.


102
0:4:8,742 --> 0:4:12,19



103
0:4:12,19 --> 0:4:14,17
-That's how you kiss
your boyfriend.


104
0:4:14,17 --> 0:4:16,74
CHARLET DUBOC: Then he got down
to a Tyra Banks-style


105
0:4:16,74 --> 0:4:17,99
interview session.


106
0:4:17,99 --> 0:4:23,49



107
0:4:23,49 --> 0:4:25,55
ARLENE: My name's
Arlene White.


108
0:4:25,55 --> 0:4:29,4
I am born and raised here
in Atlanta, Georgia.


109
0:4:29,4 --> 0:4:31,646
JANAE BROOKS: Janae Brooks,
and I'm 19.


110
0:4:31,646 --> 0:4:32,138
STINA DIAS: Stina Dias.


111
0:4:32,138 --> 0:4:34,106
I'm from Kansas City as well.


112
0:4:34,106 --> 0:4:35,9
BILLY BAD ASS: What
sign are you?


113
0:4:35,9 --> 0:4:36,8
-Capricorn.


114
0:4:36,8 --> 0:4:37,2
-I'm a Libra.


115
0:4:37,2 --> 0:4:37,99
-Water sign.


116
0:4:37,99 --> 0:4:39,52
JANAE BROOKS: I'm an Aries.


117
0:4:39,52 --> 0:4:40,49
STINA DIAS: Really?


118
0:4:40,49 --> 0:4:41,46
I am too!


119
0:4:41,46 --> 0:4:41,945
JANAE BROOKS: Really?


120
0:4:41,945 --> 0:4:42,43
STINA DIAS: Yeah.


121
0:4:42,43 --> 0:4:44,37
[GIGGLING]


122
0:4:44,37 --> 0:4:45,55
CHARLET DUBOC: And the
questioning got


123
0:4:45,55 --> 0:4:47,23
increasingly awkward.


124
0:4:47,23 --> 0:4:49,782
BILLY BAD ASS: Let's say, for
example, we're at a club, and


125
0:4:49,782 --> 0:4:53,465
we wanted to party, and you
were ready to go, and we


126
0:4:53,465 --> 0:4:54,57
weren't ready to go.


127
0:4:54,57 --> 0:4:55,82
-Um.


128
0:4:55,82 --> 0:4:57,58



129
0:4:57,58 --> 0:4:58,81
BILLY BAD ASS: What if you were
waiting for your flight


130
0:4:58,81 --> 0:5:1,18
and you were waiting and you
couldn't get on the flight,


131
0:5:1,18 --> 0:5:1,92
and you got bumped.


132
0:5:1,92 --> 0:5:2,52
What would you do?


133
0:5:2,52 --> 0:5:4,732
JANAE BROOKS: I don't
really know.


134
0:5:4,732 --> 0:5:5,982
Um.


135
0:5:5,982 --> 0:5:8,989



136
0:5:8,989 --> 0:5:10,41
I'm not sure, really.


137
0:5:10,41 --> 0:5:11,83
BILLY BAD ASS: There's
a reason you're here.


138
0:5:11,83 --> 0:5:15,0
What reason should I bring you
that you would stand out?


139
0:5:15,0 --> 0:5:18,175
What is it about you as a person
that's going to make me


140
0:5:18,175 --> 0:5:19,58
want to bring you to London?


141
0:5:19,58 --> 0:5:20,55
What's in your heart?


142
0:5:20,55 --> 0:5:23,36
What's the passion you have
that's going to make you do


143
0:5:23,36 --> 0:5:24,9
something in London?


144
0:5:24,9 --> 0:5:27,576
JANAE BROOKS: That I'm just
really determined.


145
0:5:27,576 --> 0:5:31,56
It's pretty much my
determination.


146
0:5:31,56 --> 0:5:35,46
Going for it, pretty much.


147
0:5:35,46 --> 0:5:40,62
He says the question, why
should we pick you?


148
0:5:40,62 --> 0:5:43,68
Me, at the time, I was thinking,
well, shoot, I don't


149
0:5:43,68 --> 0:5:43,984
really know.


150
0:5:43,984 --> 0:5:45,36
I'm just here.


151
0:5:45,36 --> 0:5:48,96
So he was like, well, I picked
you because of something


152
0:5:48,96 --> 0:5:50,79
really deep down.


153
0:5:50,79 --> 0:5:56,65
Maybe I didn't know what the
answer was, but he knew it was


154
0:5:56,65 --> 0:5:58,52
something else.


155
0:5:58,52 --> 0:5:59,45
I with I knew.


156
0:5:59,45 --> 0:6:1,29
STINA DIAS: And at the end of
the day, we ended up spending


157
0:6:1,29 --> 0:6:4,2
close to $1,000 just
to get down here.


158
0:6:4,2 --> 0:6:5,86
It's a lot of money.


159
0:6:5,86 --> 0:6:9,18
CHARLET DUBOC: And why is it
worth that much money?


160
0:6:9,18 --> 0:6:9,98
STINA DIAS: It'll never
come again.


161
0:6:9,98 --> 0:6:12,5
JANAE BROOKS: Nothing like this
will ever come again.


162
0:6:12,5 --> 0:6:15,51
Just the fact that we came to
Atlanta, a lot models in


163
0:6:15,51 --> 0:6:19,38
Kansas City have never even
been out of the city, let


164
0:6:19,38 --> 0:6:22,36
alone out of the state.


165
0:6:22,36 --> 0:6:24,63
CHARLET DUBOC: I wasn't sure of
the reason behind Billy's


166
0:6:24,63 --> 0:6:27,91
tough love approach, and
wondered how much of this was


167
0:6:27,91 --> 0:6:30,5
for the benefit of the camera.


168
0:6:30,5 --> 0:6:32,55
BILLY BAD ASS: Sometimes people
don't, they don't


169
0:6:32,55 --> 0:6:33,61
prepare themselves.


170
0:6:33,61 --> 0:6:36,16
Like, that girl came all the
way from Kansas City.


171
0:6:36,16 --> 0:6:38,7
She could have practiced her
photos, she could have


172
0:6:38,7 --> 0:6:40,62
practiced her attitude.


173
0:6:40,62 --> 0:6:42,38
In the next time, they're
going to be a lot more


174
0:6:42,38 --> 0:6:44,28
prepared, especially if they're
dealing with me.


175
0:6:44,28 --> 0:6:46,93
Because you don't know what
you're going to get with me.


176
0:6:46,93 --> 0:6:49,2
I know a lot of people.


177
0:6:49,2 --> 0:6:51,64
I'm going out to Vegas
and hanging out with


178
0:6:51,64 --> 0:6:52,61
Mayweather's people.


179
0:6:52,61 --> 0:6:56,44
Mayweather just got out of jail,
but I'm friends with


180
0:6:56,44 --> 0:6:58,12
some of those people that
he hangs out with.


181
0:6:58,12 --> 0:7:0,87
So I'm going out there, and
they're going to show me a


182
0:7:0,87 --> 0:7:3,59
good time, and I'm going to
be prepared for that.


183
0:7:3,59 --> 0:7:5,52
My gear's going to be right.


184
0:7:5,52 --> 0:7:6,85
My swag is going to be up.


185
0:7:6,85 --> 0:7:10,37
I'm going to be like, yeah, I
can hang out with Mayweather,


186
0:7:10,37 --> 0:7:11,65
with his 30 cars.


187
0:7:11,65 --> 0:7:12,77
I can hang out with him.


188
0:7:12,77 --> 0:7:14,35
So that's what it's about.


189
0:7:14,35 --> 0:7:14,944
You've got to be prepared.


190
0:7:14,944 --> 0:7:17,67
[MUSIC PLAYING]


191
0:7:17,67 --> 0:7:19,56
CHARLET DUBOC: Billy had
organized an afterparty of


192
0:7:19,56 --> 0:7:22,2
sorts at a club.


193
0:7:22,2 --> 0:7:25,17
However, only two of his friends
and the lady NASCAR


194
0:7:25,17 --> 0:7:26,92
driver showed up.


195
0:7:26,92 --> 0:7:30,0
But Billy implored us to keep
the camera rolling.


196
0:7:30,0 --> 0:7:32,83
So I sat and talked nicely with
his friends about their


197
0:7:32,83 --> 0:7:35,18
cool idea for a zombie movie.


198
0:7:35,18 --> 0:7:38,82
This wasn't quite the Atlanta
experience I'd imagined, but


199
0:7:38,82 --> 0:7:40,41
then it was only our
first night.


200
0:7:40,41 --> 0:9:40,41
