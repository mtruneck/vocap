1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:12,45



2
0:0:12,45 --> 0:0:14,26
CHRIS KOUTSIS: What's
up, buddy?


3
0:0:14,26 --> 0:0:15,125
MIKE RUBENDALL: How
you doing, pal?


4
0:0:15,125 --> 0:0:16,236
CHRIS KOUTSIS: It's
going [INAUDIBLE].


5
0:0:16,236 --> 0:0:16,654
What's going on?


6
0:0:16,654 --> 0:0:17,49
MIKE RUBENDALL: How's
everything, all right?


7
0:0:17,49 --> 0:0:18,32
CHRIS KOUTSIS: What's
up, guys?


8
0:0:18,32 --> 0:0:19,292
How you doing?


9
0:0:19,292 --> 0:0:20,264
Hanging in there.


10
0:0:20,264 --> 0:0:21,99
MIKE RUBENDALL: We have
to give them the tour.


11
0:0:21,99 --> 0:0:24,206
CHRIS KOUTSIS: Cool, yeah.


12
0:0:24,206 --> 0:0:26,8
MIKE RUBENDALL: They spent three
and a half hours with


13
0:0:26,8 --> 0:0:27,2
Frank today.


14
0:0:27,2 --> 0:0:28,34
CHRIS KOUTSIS: Got some
good stories?


15
0:0:28,34 --> 0:0:29,99
MIKE RUBENDALL: Yeah.


16
0:0:29,99 --> 0:0:32,94
I was just always intrigued
and fascinated by tattoos.


17
0:0:32,94 --> 0:0:35,73
And it just suddenly popped
into my head, and


18
0:0:35,73 --> 0:0:37,18
I had tunnel vision.


19
0:0:37,18 --> 0:0:38,44
That's all I wanted
to do, that's all


20
0:0:38,44 --> 0:0:39,68
I could think about.


21
0:0:39,68 --> 0:0:43,72
And I called different tattoo
shops and tried to figure out


22
0:0:43,72 --> 0:0:46,66
what approach I would take, or
what avenue I would take, in


23
0:0:46,66 --> 0:0:49,56
order to learn the craft.


24
0:0:49,56 --> 0:0:55,53
And that's when I went into
Da Vinci's and met Frank.


25
0:0:55,53 --> 0:0:59,99
This was Franks' first tattoo
when he was 16 years old.


26
0:0:59,99 --> 0:1:2,11
He nailed it on that one.


27
0:1:2,11 --> 0:1:6,62
FRANK: He always carried
himself very well.


28
0:1:6,62 --> 0:1:10,5
He was never a snot-nosed
kid or disrespectful.


29
0:1:10,5 --> 0:1:12,12
He always introduces
me as the guy that


30
0:1:12,12 --> 0:1:13,85
taught him how to tattoo.


31
0:1:13,85 --> 0:1:15,49
This is Frank, this is the
guy that taught me


32
0:1:15,49 --> 0:1:18,51
everything I know.


33
0:1:18,51 --> 0:1:20,79
Shit.


34
0:1:20,79 --> 0:1:23,44
I'm one of the most important
people on the planet.


35
0:1:23,44 --> 0:1:25,93
Seriously, think about it,
you know what I mean?


36
0:1:25,93 --> 0:1:28,56
I taught one of the greatest
tattooers of


37
0:1:28,56 --> 0:1:32,8
all time how to tattoo.


38
0:1:32,8 --> 0:1:33,71
Not too many people
can say that.


39
0:1:33,71 --> 0:1:40,84



40
0:1:40,84 --> 0:1:43,63
And he just walked in with his
brother one day, it's like, he


41
0:1:43,63 --> 0:1:44,78
wants to get into this.


42
0:1:44,78 --> 0:1:48,52
And right away in my mind I'm
like, OK, I got to get rid of


43
0:1:48,52 --> 0:1:50,23
this fucking brat.


44
0:1:50,23 --> 0:1:53,52
And I had gotten rid of people
in the past by handing them a


45
0:1:53,52 --> 0:1:56,16
tattoo magazine and
saying draw 20


46
0:1:56,16 --> 0:1:57,25
things out of this magazine.


47
0:1:57,25 --> 0:1:58,934
But this kid--


48
0:1:58,934 --> 0:2:1,202
if you know anything
about Mike, you


49
0:2:1,202 --> 0:2:2,452
know he ain't a quitter.


50
0:2:2,452 --> 0:2:5,96



51
0:2:5,96 --> 0:2:9,38
And that's the thing, like
he just kept coming back.


52
0:2:9,38 --> 0:2:11,97
Maybe it was just easier to
teach the guy than it was to


53
0:2:11,97 --> 0:2:14,61
get rid of him, you know?


54
0:2:14,61 --> 0:2:16,5
MIKE RUBENDALL: I went there,
and he kind of blew me off.


55
0:2:16,5 --> 0:2:19,57
I came back, he's like, OK,
you want to learn how to


56
0:2:19,57 --> 0:2:22,64
tattoo, take 10 drawings out
of a tattoo magazine.


57
0:2:22,64 --> 0:2:24,14
Don't trace them, draw
them, copy them,


58
0:2:24,14 --> 0:2:25,16
and bring them back.


59
0:2:25,16 --> 0:2:27,42
I guess it took me about a
month to do 10 drawings.


60
0:2:27,42 --> 0:2:31,18
Brought those 10 back,
and he made me do


61
0:2:31,18 --> 0:2:32,54
another 25 after that.


62
0:2:32,54 --> 0:2:33,58
He's like, all right--


63
0:2:33,58 --> 0:2:36,978
just kind of just
pushing me off.


64
0:2:36,978 --> 0:2:39,4
JOE PAPPALARDO, JR.: The first
time I remember him bringing


65
0:2:39,4 --> 0:2:40,67
up tattooing, I think
we were in 11th or


66
0:2:40,67 --> 0:2:41,59
12th grade art class.


67
0:2:41,59 --> 0:2:44,46
He asked the teacher, I want
to apprentice at the shop,


68
0:2:44,46 --> 0:2:46,54
they want me to draw 20 of
these, can I spend my time in


69
0:2:46,54 --> 0:2:48,48
class redrawing these?


70
0:2:48,48 --> 0:2:49,45
And she was fine with
it, she said yes.


71
0:2:49,45 --> 0:2:51,135
And I think that's
how he started.


72
0:2:51,135 --> 0:2:54,1
FRANK: Nobody's very good
when they first come in.


73
0:2:54,1 --> 0:2:58,61
What he had that was apparent
was tenacity.


74
0:2:58,61 --> 0:3:2,15
That's probably more important
than being a good artist.


75
0:3:2,15 --> 0:3:4,94
In fact, if he was too good I
might have felt threatened and


76
0:3:4,94 --> 0:3:7,86
told him you don't have
what it takes.


77
0:3:7,86 --> 0:3:10,72
You should probably go home
and stay home, or somebody


78
0:3:10,72 --> 0:3:12,44
might beat the fucking
shit out of you.


79
0:3:12,44 --> 0:3:16,248



80
0:3:16,248 --> 0:3:18,52
MIKE RUBENDALL: This was all
the flash I had to trace.


81
0:3:18,52 --> 0:3:20,328
MALE SPEAKER: Did you
trace that sheet?


82
0:3:20,328 --> 0:3:21,6
MIKE RUBENDALL: I traced that
sheet a couple times.


83
0:3:21,6 --> 0:3:23,785
Some Mr. Miyagi shit.


84
0:3:23,785 --> 0:3:27,6
FRANK: The guy had an uphill
battle from Jump Street.


85
0:3:27,6 --> 0:3:33,22
I wasn't going to be convinced
that he really wanted it until


86
0:3:33,22 --> 0:3:34,345
I couldn't shake him.


87
0:3:34,345 --> 0:3:37,67
I just kept putting more and
more hurdles in front of him,


88
0:3:37,67 --> 0:3:41,0
making the hurdles higher,
making them closer together,


89
0:3:41,0 --> 0:3:43,42
making it harder and
harder for him.


90
0:3:43,42 --> 0:3:47,32
Because really all of that, all
of the beginning part of


91
0:3:47,32 --> 0:3:51,36
the apprenticeship, is not
to teach him anything--


92
0:3:51,36 --> 0:3:54,85
it's to teach me something.


93
0:3:54,85 --> 0:3:58,54
How far can I push this guy away
and have him still come


94
0:3:58,54 --> 0:4:2,63
back, because that tells
me he really wants it.


95
0:4:2,63 --> 0:4:7,13
MIKE RUBENDALL: I think that
was Frank's '55, but it's


96
0:4:7,13 --> 0:4:7,97
souped up there.


97
0:4:7,97 --> 0:4:10,23
That's the one I was
in the trunk.


98
0:4:10,23 --> 0:4:12,46
That's the one we would
take to Coney


99
0:4:12,46 --> 0:4:13,88
Island High on St. Mark's.


100
0:4:13,88 --> 0:4:16,51



101
0:4:16,51 --> 0:4:19,519
He would make me wash his car
in the back, and he had like


102
0:4:19,519 --> 0:4:20,779
nine cars at one time.


103
0:4:20,779 --> 0:4:23,4
And then I would finish one
and then he would bring


104
0:4:23,4 --> 0:4:24,34
another one by.


105
0:4:24,34 --> 0:4:27,84
Because he lived locally, so he
would go, grab another car,


106
0:4:27,84 --> 0:4:30,97
bring it back, I would
wash it and wax it.


107
0:4:30,97 --> 0:4:33,59
Oh man, what does this have
to do with tattooing?


108
0:4:33,59 --> 0:4:35,84
MALE SPEAKER: What were some of
your favorite activities to


109
0:4:35,84 --> 0:4:37,65
have Mike as an apprentice do?


110
0:4:37,65 --> 0:4:39,64
FRANK: Anything that
would humiliate him


111
0:4:39,64 --> 0:4:41,36
and break him down.


112
0:4:41,36 --> 0:4:44,23
I don't remember laying
a hand on him.


113
0:4:44,23 --> 0:4:45,125
I really don't.


114
0:4:45,125 --> 0:4:47,406
MALE SPEAKER: He said one time
you guys were just going punch


115
0:4:47,406 --> 0:4:47,892
for punch, I think.


116
0:4:47,892 --> 0:4:48,94
FRANK: Me and him?


117
0:4:48,94 --> 0:4:49,53
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.


118
0:4:49,53 --> 0:4:53,1
FRANK: I mean, I definitely
remember people getting


119
0:4:53,1 --> 0:4:56,74
hog-tied with lamp
cords and stuff.


120
0:4:56,74 --> 0:4:58,6
That I clearly remember.


121
0:4:58,6 --> 0:5:0,97
I don't know who did it, but I
do remember that happening.


122
0:5:0,97 --> 0:5:4,25
I remember people being put
in the trunk of cars--


123
0:5:4,25 --> 0:5:5,93
people got broken down.


124
0:5:5,93 --> 0:5:9,72
It's the same theory that the
military uses, break them down


125
0:5:9,72 --> 0:5:11,11
and build them up.


126
0:5:11,11 --> 0:5:14,47
Strip them down, strip
them down to nothing.


127
0:5:14,47 --> 0:5:16,44
And then build a
better machine.


128
0:5:16,44 --> 0:5:20,324



129
0:5:20,324 --> 0:5:23,4
MIKE RUBENDALL: I just accepted
this is how you get


130
0:5:23,4 --> 0:5:26,1
into it, you just keep dealing
with the bullshit.


131
0:5:26,1 --> 0:5:27,47
I didn't really think
much about it.


132
0:5:27,47 --> 0:5:30,61
I just accepted the fact that
this is what I need to do to


133
0:5:30,61 --> 0:5:33,35
get my foot in the door and
learn how to tattoo.


134
0:5:33,35 --> 0:5:36,69



135
0:5:36,69 --> 0:5:41,37
His mentality was tough love, so
he put me through a pretty


136
0:5:41,37 --> 0:5:43,61
rigorous process.


137
0:5:43,61 --> 0:5:47,55
At times I didn't think I was
going to make it, and I


138
0:5:47,55 --> 0:5:49,43
thought I would have a
nervous breakdown.


139
0:5:49,43 --> 0:5:52,31
I was 17 years old,
so I was a kid.


140
0:5:52,31 --> 0:5:54,53
I didn't know anything
about life, I


141
0:5:54,53 --> 0:5:56,49
hadn't traveled anywhere.


142
0:5:56,49 --> 0:6:2,5
And then I meet this maniac,
and he's leading the way.


143
0:6:2,5 --> 0:6:7,59
He grew up tattooing,
fighting, drinking.


144
0:6:7,59 --> 0:6:12,46
He was like the epitome of
an old-school tattooer.


145
0:6:12,46 --> 0:6:14,43
He was around when it counted.


146
0:6:14,43 --> 0:6:17,88
He's one of those guys that when
you meet him, you're like


147
0:6:17,88 --> 0:6:20,9
wow, they don't make guys
like this anymore.


148
0:6:20,9 --> 0:6:23,47
And you're just happy to have
the experience with him.


149
0:6:23,47 --> 0:6:26,84
FRANK: And he's like young, and
he's full of energy, and


150
0:6:26,84 --> 0:6:28,34
buying tattoo magazines.


151
0:6:28,34 --> 0:6:32,46
He's a sponge, and I'm from
a whole different thing.


152
0:6:32,46 --> 0:6:36,65
It's like if you're an old
school Italian and somebody's


153
0:6:36,65 --> 0:6:40,83
trying to teach you French
cooking, it's a hard thing,


154
0:6:40,83 --> 0:6:43,3
I'm sure, to do.


155
0:6:43,3 --> 0:6:46,9
At the time, he's looking at
all this stuff, and he's


156
0:6:46,9 --> 0:6:48,84
asking me a million questions.


157
0:6:48,84 --> 0:6:54,1
And it's probably very difficult
for me to be into


158
0:6:54,1 --> 0:6:55,12
talking about that shit.


159
0:6:55,12 --> 0:6:57,82
Because I'm like fuck him, and
fuck him, and this guy sucks,


160
0:6:57,82 --> 0:6:58,85
look at that thing.


161
0:6:58,85 --> 0:7:7,87
And then bingo, he sees Filip
Leu's work, and it's like he's


162
0:7:7,87 --> 0:7:9,84
stepping over my clipboard,
can't get out


163
0:7:9,84 --> 0:7:10,76
the door fast enough.


164
0:7:10,76 --> 0:7:14,78
Like, I need to see
more of this.


165
0:7:14,78 --> 0:7:18,2
And then he's telling me, he's
like I want to go to


166
0:7:18,2 --> 0:7:19,985
Switzerland.


167
0:7:19,985 --> 0:7:23,25
That was mind blowing.


168
0:7:23,25 --> 0:7:26,62
I think I was like, I don't
know if you can go to


169
0:7:26,62 --> 0:7:27,273
Switzerland, you know?


170
0:7:27,273 --> 0:7:30,7
JOE PAPPALARDO, JR.: Give us
the guided tour, why not?


171
0:7:30,7 --> 0:7:34,381
This is the best part right
here, this window.


172
0:7:34,381 --> 0:7:35,631
Here on the third floor.


173
0:7:35,631 --> 0:7:39,1



174
0:7:39,1 --> 0:7:41,11
So Mike always knew I was
interested in traveling, and


175
0:7:41,11 --> 0:7:44,31
when he made his appointment
with Filip he just asked me if


176
0:7:44,31 --> 0:7:44,99
I wanted to go.


177
0:7:44,99 --> 0:7:47,58
And I think we went there for
four days or five days.


178
0:7:47,58 --> 0:7:50,125
I just went for a good time,
and that's what we had.


179
0:7:50,125 --> 0:7:54,29
MIKE RUBENDALL: Filip is a
tattooer from Switzerland.


180
0:7:54,29 --> 0:7:57,9
And at the time I had to contact
him, but he didn't


181
0:7:57,9 --> 0:7:59,6
have a telephone, and there
was no email back than.


182
0:7:59,6 --> 0:8:1,96
So I would write him letters,
trying to get an appointment.


183
0:8:1,96 --> 0:8:5,93
And I would receive these
beautiful handwritten letters


184
0:8:5,93 --> 0:8:8,25
back from his wife Titine.


185
0:8:8,25 --> 0:8:11,2
And she explained what I would
have to do as far as deposits,


186
0:8:11,2 --> 0:8:14,6
and how far he was booked
out in advance.


187
0:8:14,6 --> 0:8:18,46
And it just opened my eyes up
to a whole new world of how


188
0:8:18,46 --> 0:8:21,68
tattooing could be.


189
0:8:21,68 --> 0:8:29,45
Da Vinci's was like war, and
fucking motorcycles, hot rods,


190
0:8:29,45 --> 0:8:32,429
ass-kickings, drinking,
fighting.


191
0:8:32,429 --> 0:8:34,694
And this was like peace,
love, happiness.


192
0:8:34,694 --> 0:8:37,6



193
0:8:37,6 --> 0:8:41,85
Between staying at his house
and being at the studio, he


194
0:8:41,85 --> 0:8:45,38
just breathed and lived
tattooing and art, and the


195
0:8:45,38 --> 0:8:47,78
whole family was involved.


196
0:8:47,78 --> 0:8:49,42
He took a very smart approach.


197
0:8:49,42 --> 0:8:51,63
Like everything was very
well prepared.


198
0:8:51,63 --> 0:8:55,13
His color study, his
composition, just everything


199
0:8:55,13 --> 0:8:58,29
had a really particular look
that I was always drawn to.


200
0:8:58,29 --> 0:9:2,26
He had this ability to work
with the human body.


201
0:9:2,26 --> 0:9:4,98
And every tattoo he did it
seemed to look like people


202
0:9:4,98 --> 0:9:6,68
were born with the tattoos,
like they


203
0:9:6,68 --> 0:9:7,93
were meant to be there.


204
0:9:7,93 --> 0:9:12,322



205
0:9:12,322 --> 0:9:14,35
JOE PAPPALARDO, JR.: It was like
the weirdest thing ever,


206
0:9:14,35 --> 0:9:15,65
but it was awesome, it
was so much fun.


207
0:9:15,65 --> 0:9:19,28
Felix's dad was there, walking
around, smoking joints,


208
0:9:19,28 --> 0:9:20,94
talking to Filip's
wife, Titine.


209
0:9:20,94 --> 0:9:22,726
She was doing all these
portraits and paintings that


210
0:9:22,726 --> 0:9:23,92
she was showing us.


211
0:9:23,92 --> 0:9:27,142
Mike got tattooed, I think,
and then we'd go out.


212
0:9:27,142 --> 0:9:29,955
Tonight is Saturday night,
and viva la Switzerland.


213
0:9:29,955 --> 0:9:32,346
And we're going to what they
like to call here as a


214
0:9:32,346 --> 0:9:34,636
discotheque.


215
0:9:34,636 --> 0:9:38,85
And it was like Filip wouldn't
come out, he's very low-key,


216
0:9:38,85 --> 0:9:40,545
and Titine would come
out with us.


217
0:9:40,545 --> 0:9:42,52
We would just go out, it was
like a club or a disco.


218
0:9:42,52 --> 0:9:44,4
And we were just drinking
and having a good time.


219
0:9:44,4 --> 0:9:46,544
MIKE RUBENDALL: You think you
have that suit downstairs?


220
0:9:46,544 --> 0:9:49,4
You could throw it on and still
roll around Long Island?


221
0:9:49,4 --> 0:9:51,96



222
0:9:51,96 --> 0:9:52,85
Oh, man.


223
0:9:52,85 --> 0:9:55,81
CHRIS O'DONNELL: Mike was very
young, and he hadn't been in


224
0:9:55,81 --> 0:9:59,13
the tattoo industry for any
really length of time before


225
0:9:59,13 --> 0:10:0,75
he went to Filip Leu
to get tattooed.


226
0:10:0,75 --> 0:10:1,7
But that was pretty unique.


227
0:10:1,7 --> 0:10:5,17
Most people don't fly to
Switzerland to get tattooed


228
0:10:5,17 --> 0:10:6,95
when they're, whatever, 18.


229
0:10:6,95 --> 0:10:10,48
And that was a good indicator
that he had a understanding of


230
0:10:10,48 --> 0:10:12,11
what was going on,
what was good, by


231
0:10:12,11 --> 0:10:13,36
going to Filip so young.


232
0:10:13,36 --> 0:10:16,962



233
0:10:16,962 --> 0:10:20,33
FRANK: The exposure to Filip
took him to another level,


234
0:10:20,33 --> 0:10:24,43
both desire-wise and
knowledge-wise.


235
0:10:24,43 --> 0:10:27,77
I'm sure he was watching
Filip like a hawk.


236
0:10:27,77 --> 0:10:31,37
I'm sure he didn't feel 90% of
that tattoo until spots were


237
0:10:31,37 --> 0:10:34,695
really bad, because he was
just watching every move.


238
0:10:34,695 --> 0:10:37,1
MIKE RUBENDALL: The short time
you stay there, it's almost


239
0:10:37,1 --> 0:10:38,59
like a Harvard education.


240
0:10:38,59 --> 0:10:40,61
You learn so much about
tattooing in a


241
0:10:40,61 --> 0:10:41,72
short period of time.


242
0:10:41,72 --> 0:10:45,63
Filip has such an influence on
and rubs off on you so easily.


243
0:10:45,63 --> 0:10:50,44
And constructs the ideas of
tattooing in a very simplistic


244
0:10:50,44 --> 0:10:56,661
way that it makes an amateur
tattooer understand it easily.


245
0:10:56,661 --> 0:10:59,96
CHRIS O'DONNELL: He was just
hell-bent on getting good.


246
0:10:59,96 --> 0:11:3,15
I don't know how much of that
was Frank, or the guys he


247
0:11:3,15 --> 0:11:6,83
worked with, or getting tattooed
by people like Filip.


248
0:11:6,83 --> 0:11:10,78
But he was just really able to
nail the whole technical side


249
0:11:10,78 --> 0:11:11,935
of it pretty quickly.


250
0:11:11,935 --> 0:11:14,66
MIKE RUBENDALL: That was a
pinnacle moment for me.


251
0:11:14,66 --> 0:11:16,53
That changed my whole outlook.


252
0:11:16,53 --> 0:11:20,71
Even like technical aspects of
it, I came back and tattooed


253
0:11:20,71 --> 0:11:21,54
completely different.


254
0:11:21,54 --> 0:11:24,33
Used different needles that
I didn't know existed.


255
0:11:24,33 --> 0:11:29,655
It was a lot of shit that
changed my life.


256
0:11:29,655 --> 0:11:33,49
FRANK: Filip brought Mike's
ability to another level, his


257
0:11:33,49 --> 0:11:34,87
desire to do better.


258
0:11:34,87 --> 0:11:39,56
At that point, he's exhausted
my capabilities.


259
0:11:39,56 --> 0:11:42,9
He's taking everything that I
could have taught him, and


260
0:11:42,9 --> 0:11:43,13
he's maximized it.


261
0:11:43,13 --> 0:11:46,708
And now he needs to take another
block and stack it on.


262
0:11:46,708 --> 0:11:51,468



263
0:11:51,468 --> 0:11:54,63
MIKE RUBENDALL: It took the best
of Frank, and took the


264
0:11:54,63 --> 0:11:57,446
best of me traveling the
world, and kind of


265
0:11:57,446 --> 0:11:59,12
integrated each one.


266
0:11:59,12 --> 0:12:2,86
Both worlds collided, they
contradicted each other.


267
0:12:2,86 --> 0:12:5,5
And some aspects of this
style tattooing


268
0:12:5,5 --> 0:12:6,51
Frank would frown upon.


269
0:12:6,51 --> 0:12:7,76
He's like oh, that's
pussy shit.


270
0:12:7,76 --> 0:12:15,84



271
0:12:15,84 --> 0:12:18,325
But then--


272
0:12:18,325 --> 0:12:20,49
I don't know, we'll
go back to that.


273
0:12:20,49 --> 0:12:21,74
MALE SPEAKER: That was awesome.


274
0:12:21,74 --> 0:14:21,74
