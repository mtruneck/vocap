###29 Fuck me. He must be desperate.
###34 Anyone watching, thinking we know fuck all about knowing fuck all
###38 about owt, needs to watch their back! Oooh!
###40 So you've had your Labour, reclassifying skunk,
###44 sending prices sky-high. Literally taking the grass from its own roots!
###50 And now you've got your ConDemNation,
###52 Liberals noshing Tories like altar boys picking dimps up!
###56 Have we had a national fucking stroke, or what?
###59 Is revolution a word, or was it never?
###64 Anybody watching needs to know, we cope better than average
###67 with irony in Chatsworth.
###69 Well for fuck's sake, we live in Manchester
###72 and they charge us for water?!
###76 I wandered lonely as a clown, necking mushrooms rarely found.

###198 Knock, knock! Still allowed in my own house!
###202 Haven't moved in a newer model yet, have you?
###204 Someone more socially acceptable?
###206 Don't be soft.
###208 Frank Gallagher's looking for digs, is he more your type?
###212 I'm OK to get some clothes, aren't I? They are my clothes.
###215 Dad...
###223 Baby, I'm so sorry.
###241 I'm so sorry.
###247 You look like a Lennon man to me. "Power To The People"... don't shoot!
###251 Fuck's sake, Marty!
###253 Just trying to make a living! Yoko!
###255 It'll cheer them up at the shelter. Nowhere to live,
###258 but at least they've got some decent knocked-off tunes!
###261 Best of luck, mate.
###262 Keep positive. It might be the best thing that ever happened.
###266 Where you heading to?
###267 Runcorn.
###270 You'll love this... Snoopy Dog... ear worm!
###273 Only dicks pay for music nowadays. It's not Victorian times!
###279 Bad day at the office?
###281 Fucking recession.
###282 No-one's got disposable income. Disgraceful.
###284 What you up to?
###286 Not much. Why?
###287 Going cruising with Madam.
###289 Fuck it.
###298 Late start this morning.
###301 They can afford it. They're winning.
###304 They've won.
###306 It's not over yet, Karen. It's all about hearts and minds.
###310 Thought it was about houses?
###314 Well, yeah.
###316 Thank you, ladies. See you next session.
###326 Partner couldn't make it again?
###329 Really bad weather up in Aberdeen. Force nine.
###332 Couldn't get off the rig. I'll make sure he's up to speed.
###336 Fingers crossed he makes it for the birth. Has he booked time off?
###341 Not sure. Let me look.
###345 Ah, here it is, filed under "Mind Your Own Fucking Business".
###351 You're clouding me chakra, man.
###359 It's like The Sopranos, this!
###361 Hanging outside the club, drinking, talking, cruising the bitches.
###367 What, with our changing bags, and nappies, extra rice cakes,
###370 in case she gets cranky? Yeah, dead like The Sopranos(!)
###377 Your future flashing before your eyes?
###379 Eh? Look, what happened, it wasn't your fault.
###383 It fucking was! Totally stole Kelly off Shane like that.
###387 Bullshit, man, it goes against the code.
###389 I'm talking about his wife and kids frying in a fire in Spain, you twat!
###394 Ah! And there is no code. She's more Mafioso than you!
###401 Fucking gangster, mate! Pow, pow, pow, pow!
###405 BABY CRIES

###410 I've got a flat screen there...
###412 You'll be a good dad, you.
###414 I won't!
###415 Don't listen to that prick!
###417 If it doesn't involve acne or MILFs, he's got no experience.
###421 I'm a fucking jinx, all right?
###423 Everything I care about, everyone I love, get damaged.
###426 There's no such thing as jinxed.
###428 Who's been in my life long-term? Cum-Bucket!
###432 Look, £10, take it or leave it.
###434 Fucking thief!
###435 Oi!
###440 Guy's going off his nut cos I won't give him £50
###442 for a two year old portable.
###444 Can't fucking move in there with shit folk are selling.
###447 I used to think it was "prawn" shop.
###448 I always thought me granddad was taking his wedding ring
###452 down to the "prawn" shop!
###456 You better have a good reason for dragging me out of my pit.
###459 Oh, yeah.
###462 Sorry I'm late. Fucking yoga stresses me out.
###467 Bob upstairs?
###468 Never showed.
###470 Bob? He hasn't missed in... ever.
###472 Had an accident, something to do with a truck and a Pelican.
###475 Poor bugger!
###479 He's got no-one.
###480 Mmm.
###482 He was a gentleman, you know. Always asked after me.
###484 "How are we today, Kelly?"
###486 And he'd actually wait for an answer.
###488 Then you'd toss him off.
###491 I'm going to go see him.
###492 Hospital's no place for you in your condition!
###495 You might catch something.
###496 Maybe it's the hormones.
###497 Fuck knows, I could bottle and sell them at the minute,
###500 but I'm going in.
###506 You missed a bit.
###513 Bastard!
###514 Fucking blood, I've just scratched myself now!
###517 We're not robbing cars! We'll never shift them!
###520 It's not the cars we're after. Watch and learn.
###527 Stop fucking hitting me! I'm 26-years-old!
###530 Fucking explain yourself!
###535 All those fuckers that are evicting people from the estate, yeah,
###537 the Gestapo, they've got to leave their motors somewhere, don't they?
###542 Can't bring them to the Chatsworth, there's thieves knocking about.
###553 It's not about the cars, it's about the booty in the boot.
###557 Have you seen the gear that that lot carry?
###560 Phones, laptops, tablets, scanners. Got to keep it somewhere.
###563 So you're taking pictures of it?
###565 If I wanted to connect my printer to my computer,
###567 how do I do it if I don't want wires everywhere?
###570 You know I don't believe in computers, don't you?
###577 Bluetooth! It detects another wireless device
###579 and asks you if you want to make a connection.
###582 To which you reply?
###585 You clever bastard!
###589 ALARM PEALS
###617 Mortgage or not...
###621 Job or no job...
###624 I will always be with you.
###628 This makes you a very lucky man, because I am a catch.
###632 Say "Thank you, Avril".
###636 I wanted more.
###637 I didn't.
###639 The whole world is fucked up because people want more.
###642 I want us, 'Tish.
###646 Everything else is just...
###649 stuff.
###659 There are people round here far worse off than us.
###663 You can say that again.
###676 What are you doing?
###678 Evicted. We've been living under here three days.
###681 Listen to your missus, mate. She talks sense.
###704 Want one? Pig in a blanket? (SNORTS)
###711 Unacceptable!
###713 Oh, yeah? Didn't takeyoulong to revert to type.
###715 I am still the same lad. I am Carl fucking Gallagher,
###719 except now I've got a job.
###721 It's not a job... it's a Faustian deal.
###724 You sold your soul to Beelzebub, you fucking
###726 muppet, and you don't even know it!
###727 Oh, yeah... what, cos of your father or your grandfather,
###731 or some fucking Irish bloke we knew 200 years ago.
###734 They're as much my blood as they are yours.
###736 Cos you come from here. Have some dignity, change your name.
###740 Fuck the past! Katie, Stella, little Cilla...
###744 that's why I'm doing it,
###745 to make this place less of a shit-hole for them to grow up in.
###748 They've sucked out your soul.
###751 Bollocks.
###752 Well, prove it, then.
###756 Yeah, go on.
###759 Yeah, thought so.
###770 (SLURRED) We were brought up... to be suspicious of the police.
###776 The oppressive arm of the state, charging demonstrators on horseback,
###780 and all that.
###782 They got my motor back once, after some little Welsh prick robbed it.
###786 Me grandad was in Cork. You know... Black and Tans.
###790 We can't have a Gallagher in the police.
###793 It's a good pension.
###794 I mean, he's a bright lad. Not academic bright, mind...
###798 he takes after his mother in that respect but he can turn his hand to...
###801 And he's a looker.
###804 What? I always thought it looked like he'd got his finger in a socket
###808 or something, you know?
###809 No. The teens, the MILFS, the GILFS...
###812 they'd all ride him, given half the chance.
###815 What the fuck is wrong with you?!
###817 Was in here last night, had one too many.
###820 Someone fingered me in the snug.
###825 Well, it wasn't me.
###828 You can smell if you want.
###833 I'll need reimbursing.
###835 After all the business he's given you over the years?
###838 True. He was a lovely customer.
###841 Isa lovely customer. He's not dead yet.
###845 He knowsyou'rehere.
###849 Every time I saw him lately, I kept complaining about my feet killing me.
###853 Used to give me a foot massage.
###855 Had a thing about feet, didn't he?
###857 He had a briefcase full of all kinds of books on feet.
###861 He's a chiropodist.
###863 Wouldn't put it past him.
###865 Back to work, soon as. Profit in that bump.
###894 For old time's sake, eh, pal?
###914 Do I look like a man with 100 quid to spare?
###916 It's quality gear, that... shifted the other two already.
###920 You could ask Jonesy. Oh no, he won't be able to
###922 take it, on account he's got no house to live in.
###925 How much?
###931 That's all I've got.
###935 How do you sleep at night?
###937 (WHISTLES)
###945 Right, I don't care who did it. I even admire your cheek a little,
###948 but... I want my computer back.
###952 It's not a work computer, it's my personal property,
###955 material of sentimental value.
###958 Pictures of my children, Christmas, birthdays, holidays.
###961 Things I can't replicate or replace. And I stupidly have no back-up.
###966 I'm sorry you've lost your mementos.
###968 Thanks to you, these people have lost their homes.
###972 They've still got photographs.
###974 They just don't have anywhere to put them.
###977 This is a step too far. Personal items are not part of the game.
###981 The game?!
###982 Yeah, the fucking game.
###985 You people... think you're so clever.
###988 What you do is not a victimless crime.
###992 You're a mad cow.
###994 All your cheating and scamming and benefit fraud...
###998 - Good people, like me... - And me.
###999 Have our lives impacted upon
###1002 by your scavenging lives. We bear the cost.
###1005 No, you fucking don't. What you mean is, the rules are rigged in your favour.
###1010 Everything's rigged in your favour,
###1012 and the moment one of us bite back, you kick and scratch and scream,
###1017 "I want mine! What about mine?!"
###1020 That's my man.
###1021 Look, come on, Miss...
###1023 Fuck off, you leech! Leave me alone.
###1025 Upset by a couple of evictions, are you?
###1027 Yeah.
###1028 (IN AMERICAN ACCENT) Getting all "Spartacus" on my ass?
###1031 Progress is coming, like it or not. Five years from now, maybe seven,
###1035 this place won't even be here. None of you will be here.
###1040 The rest of society are not funding the underbelly any more.
###1044 We're not doing it. So it won't be 30 evictions, or 40, or even 100.
###1051 Ten years from now, this place will be wasteland!
###1056 And that's not opinion...
###1058 that's policy.
###1060 (MAN) Go on, fuck off!
###1077 If I'd wanted misery, I could have stayed at home.
###1080 What sort of shop are you running here anyway?
###1083 This place is fucked.
###1085 It's always been fucked... it's a vital part of its appeal.
###1088 People don't know what the future holds... they're upset.
###1091 The future is what you fucking make it!
###1093 Come on, where's the spirit of '68?
###1099 Oh, what the fuck?! Student riots? Paris? Prague Spring?
###1104 Tune in, drop out,
###1106 shag a skank because she'll let you?
###1109 Civil... disobedience.
###1113 Huh? You don't have to play by their
###1115 fucking rules... make some up of your own.
###1117 Seize the fucking day.
###1119 It's like the French, but they blockade the motorways.
###1122 And burn sheep. They do.
###1124 Thank you. You have to admire the Gauls for their gall,
###1130 despite their cheese-eating surrender-monkey tendencies.
###1134 What more can we do?
###1135 Why does it matter to you anyway?
###1137 Because all this misery
###1140 is ruining my fucking pint.
###1148 I'm hanging up my crotchless when this little bundle drops.
###1152 Can't have your mam on the game, can you?
###1159 I've got to be responsible. I mean...
###1166 If me and Marty go tits up like me and Shane... cos these things happen...
###1170 it'll just be me and a kid.
###1180 I want this...
###1182 more than I've ever wanted anything, Bob.
###1184 The fella, the kid, flat,
###1187 nice little job where I don't have to wear a gum-shield.
###1195 I want the dream.
###1199 Reckon him upstairs will let me have it?
###1201 Have what?
###1205 Sorry. Who are you?
###1208 His wife. Who are you?
###1216 Ta.
###1218 Not a typical hospital visitor, if you don't mind me saying so.
###1223 I'm just aware that some folk don't have anyone.
###1226 I mean, I had no idea Bob were married.
###1229 You missed his wedding ring?
###1230 He never wore it.
###1232 Sorry, my dad never wore a wedding ring.
###1236 I just don't even think to look.
###1244 That must've been a real shock. I'm sorry.
###1248 The doctor said I should prepare myself for the worst.
###1252 The damage to his brain's extensive, and if he did make a recovery...
###1256 Look, you don't know what'll happen, nor do the doctors,
###1259 they're just giving you a worst-case scenario.
###1270 Have a look in "My Photos". You know she'll
###1272 have some homemade porn on there, don't you?
###1275 She's a businesswoman.
###1276 She is filth, I can tell, mate. "This place will be wasteland!"
###1280 I almost come in me pants!
###1282 Hey, we could stick up a couple of barricades,
###1284 block the roads, like Derry in the old days.
###1286 Oh, that's all we need... rubber bullets and petrol bombs.
###1289 Could enlist Marty Fisher, he burns stuff.
###1292 Oh, that's opening a can of worms.
###1294 He's imbalanced, he wouldn't know when tostop.
###1297 That's what Kelly says!
###1299 Sorry.
###1301 Maybe we take the fight toher.
###1303 Why is the Chatsworth the battleground? Take it to hergaff.
###1306 It's nice, hergaff. She tried to seduce me there, you know.
###1308 (MIMI) Ha!
###1310 She's got a meeting tomorrow at her hotel.
###1312 Council, Work and Pensions, they're all coming.
###1314 Dress the girl up as a chambermaid, bug the room.
###1316 I'd look brilliant as a chambermaid.
###1318 Good idea, Jason Bourne! Should I get my bag of listening devices?
###1321 I resisted, if anyone's interested.
###1325 I think she craves the furry chalice.
###1327 Oh, fuck me, I would pay to see that.
###1329 We won't need to bug the room.
###1331 How so?
###1332 You'll see.
###1335 Right, everyone, this is Jodie.
###1337 She's got a rather unique talent.
###1340 If you can just stand aside.
###1346 The old one is saying, "Dress you up like a chambermaid at my place,
###1349 "we could charge a ton an hour.
###1352 " The young one says, "I will have tuition fees to pay."
###1354 What the fuck?!
###1355 She can read minds?!
###1357 Lips, dickhead! She lip-reads. Jodie is going to be our secret weapon.
###1361 Well done.
###1372 (LAUGHS)
###1375 DISTANT PLAYGROUND NOISES
###1379 # You stepped out of a cloud
###1384 # I want to take you away
###1389 # Away from the crowd... #
###1393 I don't understand.
###1396 This can't be happening.
###1399 # Alone and apart
###1403 # Out of a dream... #
###1407 Breaking and entering, damage to property.
###1410 You said yourselves yesterday, we make the rules.
###1413 Every time you break them, you're giving us more ammunition.
###1416 You're damaging yourselves.
###1418 That's clever.
###1420 We'll just evict all over again, only this time,
###1423 the penalties will be stiffer. Custodial.
###1426 But no-one's back in the same house.
###1429 What?
###1431 No-one's returned to the same properties.
###1433 All have got new occupants.
###1435 So, your info, work and pensions, Inland Revenue, council tax.
###1439 Immigration.
###1440 Useless.
###1442 You don't know who's who, or where.
###1446 You don't seriously think this will stop it?
###1449 (LAUGHS) Yeah.
###1453 I seriously do.
###1455 (LAUGHS)
###1461 We're so screwed.
###1464 They'll be back. Only next time, they'll hit twice as hard.
###1467 Dogs, PSCs, alarm systems
###1470 and custody for anyone who doesn't comply.
###1472 I love my job.
###1474 MOBILE PHONE RINGS
###1478 Two, three, four
###1481 and out. Arrows of light!
###1483 Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, haaah!
###1488 Camel toe!
###1489 Bless you!
###1490 What's wi' twitches?
###1492 You know I still get it with you, when I've got the horn.
###1495 You've got the horn?
###1496 Yeah.
###1499 Fucking brilliant. Now I've got the horn!
###1505 Great. OK, up we get, mums. Thank you very much.
###1511 This is better than being on a rig off Aberdeen, eh?
###1515 What?
###1516 Have you booked time off for the birth?
###1518 Oi! "One-Born-Every-Minute." Back off.
###1521 No, it's all right. How can I be negative about this? We'll be good.
###1525 THEY GRUNT
###1528 You'll have to excuse us, but you know what hormones are like.
###1531 I really need to go ride my boy.
###1534 Have you had any thoughts on breast-feeding?
###1537 Unleash the beast.
###1538 Tit wank, nipple rash, areola! Udders, puppies, milky mountains!
###1546 Tell me again!
###1548 I want our baby! I love our baby.
###1551 Oh, baby!
###1555 The welfare state is over. Housing, health, education.
###1558 It just got bloated and unaffordable.
###1561 It's a direct consequence of everyone living longer.
###1565 Blah, blah, blah. That's what you sound like to me, do you know that?
###1569 We can beat them. We're better than them.
###1571 It's not about them and us.
###1574 We're no fucking different.
###1576 What, you think they don't love their kids as much as we love ours?
###1580 I have rejected 20 calls today, from my estranged, alcoholic husband,
###1586 who presently is fucking a girl barely scraping legality.
###1592 And yet, at some point, at some point,
###1597 I will let him come back...
###1600 and rip the heart out of me again and pay for the privilege.
###1603 How is that better?
###1606 My husband wets the bed.
###1610 Look, it's about the system, and getting it to work for YOU.
###1614 That's all that counts.
###1615 It's time to grow some balls, Feeney.
###1619 You don't sound like yourself.
###1622 Be very clear...
###1625 There are no lengths I won't go to.
###1630 What, you think I'm going to let 10 lazy bastards
###1632 keep me from my salary?
###1640 Well, that's all right. You're the middle of the sandwich...
###1643 I want one up there...
###1647 I might have fucking known.
###1648 I was tricked down here, all right?
###1651 She said she'd give me a blow...
###1653 Only to lure him in.
###1654 I tried the trail of bread crumbs, but he didn't pick up on it.
###1658 Right, that door stays locked until you sort it out.
###1662 Any stock he drinks, you pay for it.
###1667 Shouldn't have to prove myself. You're my dad.
###1670 Hundred million sperm, and me best swimmer turns out to be a Judas.
###1674 What are the chances?
###1677 When are you due?
###1680 I'm five months gone.
###1683 Your first?
###1685 We only had the one. Unplanned.
###1688 This one took me a little bit by surprise.
###1691 Scared?
###1693 I'm fuckin' terrified.
###1694 You'll be a great mum.
###1696 Look at the kindness you've shown me.
###1698 Look at how you care for Bob, someone you don't even know.
###1702 I think you're remarkable.
###1711 I love a man who's in touch with his feminine side.
###1714 Got your moisturiser on my forehead too.
###1716 The Christmas present, or the good one?
###1717 Green bottle.
###1720 Can't read any more of this.
###1722 It's all spreadsheets and proposals. Going snow-blind.
###1725 You did good.
###1726 I won't let it go to my head.
###1731 Have you seen this?
###1732 Her contract is on here. It's totally gold-plated.
###1736 We've got to get this to Karen and Jamie.
###1738 Here's the interesting stuff.
###1740 Her contract of employment. Terms and conditions.
###1743 150 grand? What, that's her salary?
###1746 That's her bonus, if she manages to permanently board up 120 houses.
###1750 That's horrible.
###1752 You can see why she'd be pissed off at us.
###1754 Is it wrong, right?
###1756 That she gives me a full-on stiffy every single time I see her?
###1761 D'you mind if I ask you a question?
###1764 How do you do it?
###1766 I mean, the whole wife thing?
###1770 All those years and you're still in love.
###1773 We haven't been in love in a long time.
###1775 We've been married 45 years. People change.
###1779 But you change together.
###1780 The love we have now is...
###1783 It's nothing like the love we used to have.
###1785 That's normal, isn't it?
###1787 I suppose.
###1789 Bob was never the most physical of men.
###1792 He never...
###1794 He wasn't a sexual man.
###1796 Eh?
###1799 I know it must seem odd to a woman of your age,
###1801 but, I need that attention. The satisfaction.
###1804 So, I looked for it and I found it with other men, other lovers.
###1810 Truth be told, I'm very much in love with someone.
###1814 I was going to tell Bob, but then this happened.
###1817 You were leaving him?
###1818 He's an old man. Inside as well as out.
###1821 Maybe you weren't trying hard enough.
###1824 Excuse me?
###1826 Never had any trouble when he were with me.
###1830 Worked out well for you, hasn't it?
###1832 Bit of luck, he'll pop his clogs and you won't have to tell him.
###1834 What do you mean, "with you"?
###1836 I'm a prostitute, love. A hooker, lady of the night, Irma la Douce.
###1841 Bob was one of my regulars.
###1843 Probably saw me when you were at your lover's.
###1845 You slut.
###1848 You're no better.
###1850 Get out!
###1853 No, Hannah, stop it!
###1855 Get off me!
###1859 Oh... (GASPS)
###1861 HEART MONITOR BEEPS
###1880 (RADIO) "Moving on, and a Moss Side man has been arrested

###1907 # SEX PISTOLS: Anarchy In The UK
###1915 # I am an anti-Christ
###1918 # I am an anarchist
###1922 # Don't know what I want, but I know how to get it
###1926 # I want to destroy the passer by
###1929 # Cos I...
###1931 # Wanna be... #
###1935 What's happened?!
###1938 Now get in! Come on!
###1944 # And I wanna be...
###1949 # ..an anarchist
###1954 # I get pissed, destroy. #
###1961 Right, let's go.
###1976 She has destroyed people's lives, she's caused total mayhem.
###1979 How's hurting her going to benefit us?
###1981 I enjoy violence as much as the next man.
###1984 We need to keep a cool head.
###1985 I want her to suffer.
###1987 Seen this film once where a cowboy cuts off the squaw's tits.
###1991 Jesus, no! When did you become so tough?
###1995 You've lost your bottle.
###1997 Your reverse psychology has fooled me...
###2000 I'm off to take a chainsaw to the woman(!)
###2003 Very funny.
###2006 What do you want?
###2015 I will not be intimidated.
###2018 I'm not trying to intimidate you.
###2021 You're going to get chopped up and thrown in the Manchester Ship Canal.
###2029 I'm not so shocked. You're not the first.
###2032 I knew a hundred lads like you when I was growing up.
###2036 You don't have to be like this.
###2039 Don't be scared.
###2041 It's not that messy...
###2043 once all the blood drains from your corpse.
###2047 The only question remaining for you,
###2049 is do you want to pass up this, literally,
###2054 once-in-a-lifetime opportunity
###2058 and deliver me a blow-job, before it's too late?
###2061 DNA, Shane!
###2063 Fuck off! I was just asking.
###2072 It's like the old days round here...
###2074 one in the bathroom, two in the dungeon. Grub's up!
###2076 (FRANK) About fucking time.
###2078 Of course, the kidnapee upstairs is worth a few bob.
###2081 150 grand bonus for kicking people out their houses?
###2084 Horrific, that.
###2086 It's the poetry of the free market.
###2088 Shut up.
###2089 Insured up to the hilt, as well.
###2091 She so much as trips over a stiletto and she's minted for life.
###2094 Can't lose for winning.
###2096 See what your lot are about?
###2097 My lot?
###2098 These are the ranks you've joined.
###2101 You are DIRECTLY responsible for the death of this community.
###2104 It's not fucking funny, it's tragic.
###2106 You miserable arsehole.
###2108 This community'll never die. Look how they're fighting back.
###2111 Kicked out their homes and still refusing to lie
###2113 down, no matter what that blonde bint does to them.
###2115 You are still spreading her gospel.
###2117 If you clobbered her over the head for the insurance,
###2120 she'd be delighted.
###2121 What fucking side are you on?
###2123 I'm on my own side.
###2124 Shut up, shut up, shut up.
###2126 Shut up, yeah? Shut up... thought forming.
###2129 Carl, Carl, Carl, Carl, Carl, Carl.
###2133 - Are you in there, son? - What?
###2136 My boy.
###2140 That is the best idea I have ever...
###2144 What is?
###2145 Do her in for the insurance money.
###2148 Let her take her black, black soul off somewhere else.
###2153 I never said that.
###2154 Yes, you fucking did and I have never been prouder.
###2159 Under those layers and layers of piggery,
###2165 a Gallagher heart still beats.
###2175 No. Under no circumstances.
###2177 You're covered by a gold-plated insurance scheme
###2180 while on Agency business.
###2182 Absolutely not.
###2184 You'd get a six figure pay out.
###2186 That doesn't make it any more palatable.
###2187 It's the "injured" bit that leaves me cold.
###2191 You will NOT empty this place. People won't just lie down.
###2195 We can arrange for you to be hurt. In a controlled manner.
###2199 And in return, you erase all databases, spreadsheets,
###2202 original copies... mainframe and backup,
###2205 on every person on the Chatsworth Estate.
###2208 You're not asking for much, are you?
###2210 Can you do it?
###2211 Yeah, it only takes a password.
###2213 I have remote access to all the systems, I can delete them.
###2217 Permanently? Including backup?
###2220 Permanently and irrevocably... if I have a mind to.
###2223 Which I don't.
###2225 Why are you so nasty?
###2228 I'm not nasty, I'm focused.
###2231 I think a woman needs to be.
###2234 Excuse me.
###2236 I have to visit the little boy's room.
###2240 How old are you?
###2242 40? 45?
###2244 Fuck off. Scrape the cement away, that one'll never see 50 again.
###2248 Your point being?
###2250 Is this how you want to spend the next two years?
###2253 Are you really that committed on getting one over on us?
###2256 But she's not committed, though, are you?
###2260 It's not political. It's not an agenda.
###2264 It's about being strong, being in control.
###2272 I bet your husband's a right prick.
###2274 (LAUGHS)
###2277 You don't hide it well.
###2279 I believe in what I'm doing. It's necessary.
###2295 But I'm so sick of all this unpleasantness.
###2300 I am. I'm so tired.
###2304 I'm exhausted.
###2310 What safeguards would I have?
###2315 Trust us, violence is our thing.
###2323 Do you need me to get you a nurse?
###2325 You should be due some pain killers.
###2328 How's Bob?
###2330 Same.
###2331 I'm sorry. The baby, you... I told you I was jinxed.
###2335 I don't need this.
###2336 Everything I touch turns to shit. Everything.
###2338 I don't have the strength for this to be about you, Marty.
###2350 Can't leave Bob on his own.
###2352 Will you forget about fucking Bob?
###2354 He has no-one...
###2358 and he could be stuck inside that injury for years.
###2361 I'll take care of Bob... worry not.
###2363 You take care of her or you've got me to answer to.
###2371 I'm sorry.
###2377 KNOCKING ON DOOR
###2379 Private meeting... fuck off!
###2381 Take one each and don't let anyone else see it.
###2385 Everyone's volunteered, but only one of us can do the deed.
###2387 "There can be only one."
###2389 Behave.
###2390 If anyone gets fingered, they'll be looking at a long stretch.
###2393 Assault on someone on government business.
###2395 What the fuck? Am I holding the coats, or what?
###2399 She knows you. We don't want her to be able to ID the attackers.
###2402 You're hardly inconspicuous.
###2404 GASPING
###2406 Firstly, Enoch, we're not the only blacks in the village.
###2410 Secondly...
###2411 (GROANS)
###2413 Besides, Dad, you couldn't beat eggs.
###2416 It's the principle.
###2417 Right, whoever's got it, wear the mask...
###2419 "Wear the mask".
###2421 Right.
###2423 And exercise some restraint. Beat her enough to get compensation,
###2427 not enough to piss her off.
###2428 Crack her on the nose.
###2430 What about, er, knee-caps? They're always good, aren't they?
###2433 Definitely no knee-caps. Too far.
###2435 Yeah, she wouldn't walk for months.
###2437 I've heard nothing.
###2439 A targeted beating. Just enough to fool a loss adjustor.
###2463 There you go, love.
###2467 Good boy.
###2471 You're DNR now, love. You've already gone, haven't you?
###2484 Good night, sweetheart. God bless.
###2488 BEEPING
###2490 # You
###2495 # Stepped out of a dream
###2501 # You are too wonderful
###2506 # To be what you seem
###2512 # Could there be eyes like yours... #
###2518 (SCREAMS)
###2520 (KAREN) Forgot your flowers.
###2522 Ate your grapes.
###2524 Can you can move your hand?
###2528 Yeah, that's the correct account.
###2532 I just wanted to check how much we have outstanding on our Council Tax?
###2547 Done.
###2548 You better not be winding us up,
###2550 cos there is still time to plant you under a fly-over.
###2556 What, they've all crashed?
###2560 And when will they be back up and running?
###2564 Everyone's system went down at the same time.
###2567 Congratulations... you're a wealthy woman.
###2570 Nice doing business with you.
###2591 (ALL) While I continue to be a police officer,
###2594 I will, to the best of my skill and knowledge,
###2597 discharge all the duties thereof, faithfully according to law.
###2602 Can you eat that, after?
###2604 The Fondant Fancy?
###2606 APPLAUSE
###2624 # He's gonna step on you again
###2629 # He's gonna step on
###2638 # Hey, rainmaker, come away from that man you know
###2643 # He's gonna take away your promised land... #
###2648 Let's get you a drink, eh?
###2651 Fuck off.
###2653 Give the lady a beer before I stick my toe up your arse,
###2656 and not in a nice way.
###2657 She's our guest. Treat her like one. Mingle, Mrs Feeney.
###2666 # Gonna stamp out your fire He can change your desire... #
###2669 No, can't make it out.
###2670 They're Polish... cheaper.
###2674 Cos that's what you're looking for in a condom...
###2676 cheapness. Forget condoms, son.
###2679 Bareback is best, first and always.
###2688 Sorry for your loss.
###2711 Are you a fucking animal?
###2713 What?
###2714 Guy's just lost a baby.
###2716 Fuck off!
###2720 (MIMI) Can I have a cold one?
###2731 Why are you all being so nice to me?
###2734 You're losing your religion as we speak.
###2737 We've all been there at one point.
###2740 You know, I never really thought of you people as people before.
###2745 LAUGHTER
###2756 You're a curious one.
###2765 You've really achieved something. I'm proud.
###2771 These people here, every one of them,
###2775 has a bar tab as long as a bride's train.
###2780 Licence to sell alcohol... reinstated.
###2784 But you said everybody's drinks were on the house.
###2789 You didn't believe that, did you?
###2790 Hearts and minds, Karen. Hearts and minds.
###2803 Technique?
###2804 Rough.
###2805 Six out of ten.
###2808 Stamina?
###2809 I've flushed myself twice just watching him.
###2812 Why am I sitting with you two?
###2815 Oh, I'm so confused.
###2821 (KELLY) 'So, when it seems you can't take any more,
###2825 'looks like there's no way out, no solution to your problems,
###2829 'just remember this... there's always tomorrow.
###2834 'It's easy to give in, to give up.
###2837 'It's much harder to look for the silver lining.
###2840 'But it's worth looking for.
###2846 'It's really worth looking for.'
###2849 Anything wrong with this picture?
###2851 Jesus, babe, we're different.
###2853 Different doesn't last. I want an open relationship.
###2857 Is it him? Are you doing him?
###2859 Calm yourself, fella.
###2861 It's the shortest mass in Manchester.
###2863 The funeral crashers. You're like fucking vultures, you two.
###2866 It's a social responsibility.
###2868 Any more sherry, I'll be shitting doilies.
###2870 Would you say a few words?
###2872 And then, of course, there was Woodstock.
###2875 I want you to take your stepfather out and get him laid.
###2878 You're shagging someone. So, who do you want to ride?
###2880 I want to ride your mum.
