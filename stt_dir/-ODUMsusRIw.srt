1
0:0:4,263 --> 0:0:7,933
...it's life and death, but once you
leave, it all becomes nice memories.


2
0:0:7,933 --> 0:0:10,336
I guess you can't be nostalgic for
something you've never loved.


3
0:0:10,336 --> 0:0:12,671
<i>Evan and Cappie got into a fight that
night that ended their friendship.</i>


4
0:0:12,671 --> 0:0:14,44
We were all friends again,
why'd you have to screw it up?


5
0:0:14,44 --> 0:0:16,108
Hey, you screwed it up!


6
0:0:16,108 --> 0:0:17,576
<i>Why are Cappie and Evan</i>
<i>still fighting?</i>


7
0:0:17,576 --> 0:0:24,467
Because of you.
They both fell for the same girl.


8
0:0:24,467 --> 0:0:26,299
Picking something I hate
just to pick.


9
0:0:26,299 --> 0:0:28,67
Welcome, truthseekers.
Why are we here?


10
0:0:28,67 --> 0:0:30,302
<i>There's nothing</i>
<i>happening between us.</i>


11
0:0:30,302 --> 0:0:34,273
So if I did anything to make you think
otherwise, then I'm really, really sorry.


12
0:0:34,273 --> 0:0:37,476
<i>She's not going to declare
our house a historical landmark.</i>


13
0:0:37,476 --> 0:0:39,445
It either has to be fixed up
or it'll have to be torn down.


14
0:0:39,445 --> 0:0:41,247
- Lasker's buying the house.
- We're saved!


15
0:0:41,247 --> 0:0:43,683
The attacks on KT, it
all started rush night, right?


16
0:0:43,683 --> 0:0:46,752
Maybe young Mr. Parkes
is our Villain X.


17
0:0:46,752 --> 0:0:49,21
- What's that?
- It's nothing.


18
0:0:49,21 --> 0:0:52,458
Our house was built
in the Spring of 1916


19
0:0:52,458 --> 0:0:54,193
and originally held 20 members


20
0:0:54,193 --> 0:0:56,929
and cost $36,000 to construct.


21
0:0:56,929 --> 0:0:59,799
It has seen over 15 changes
to its structure,


22
0:0:59,799 --> 0:1:2,34
twelve of which were
intentional.


23
0:1:2,34 --> 0:1:5,4
And now it's about to see
its most extensive one to date.


24
0:1:5,4 --> 0:1:10,776
Yep, thanks to my dad,
Mr. Saving the Day... Man.


25
0:1:10,776 --> 0:1:13,279
I need to work on my insults.


26
0:1:13,279 --> 0:1:15,181
Hey, Cap.
Good luck on your finals!


27
0:1:15,181 --> 0:1:21,22
Gee, thanks, Peter!


28
0:1:21,22 --> 0:1:22,822
I don't trust that kid.


29
0:1:22,822 --> 0:1:24,99
And it's not just because
of his shifty eyes.


30
0:1:24,99 --> 0:1:27,493
Well it's a little bit
his shifty eyes.


31
0:1:27,493 --> 0:1:29,228
I really don't think
Peter is Villain X.


32
0:1:29,228 --> 0:1:30,629
He just has family issues.


33
0:1:30,629 --> 0:1:31,997
And shifty eyes.


34
0:1:31,997 --> 0:1:34,7
Regardless, we have
more pressing matters.


35
0:1:34,7 --> 0:1:36,335
We have to be out of here
by tomorrow night


36
0:1:36,335 --> 0:1:38,337
so Lasker's guys
can start the renovations.


37
0:1:38,337 --> 0:1:40,39
And get our house GPA
up to a 2.0.


38
0:1:40,39 --> 0:1:41,674
Which is something I want
to talk to you about.


39
0:1:41,674 --> 0:1:43,309
I have one more final left.


40
0:1:43,309 --> 0:1:46,112
Well, it's not so much
a final as it is a


41
0:1:46,112 --> 0:1:49,548
philosophical rumination and
oration on life and the history of


42
0:1:49,548 --> 0:1:51,951
the universal perception.


43
0:1:51,951 --> 0:1:53,319
How do we not have a 2.0?


44
0:1:53,319 --> 0:1:55,54
And since you're done
with your finals,


45
0:1:55,54 --> 0:1:57,49
I was thinking maybe while I'm
preparing to orate,


46
0:1:57,49 --> 0:2:0,92
you could be
substitute president.


47
0:2:0,92 --> 0:2:4,697
We have a lot to do around here,
I could really use the help.


48
0:2:4,697 --> 0:2:6,732
- Yes, Yeah, Yes.
- Yeah?


49
0:2:6,732 --> 0:2:17,9
President Russell Alan
Cartwright. Substitute.


50
0:2:17,9 --> 0:2:19,411
Hey, Case.


51
0:2:19,411 --> 0:2:20,579
What's up with your arm?


52
0:2:20,579 --> 0:2:22,114
Nothing.


53
0:2:22,114 --> 0:2:24,917
Look at this, I found
an article on the razing


54
0:2:24,917 --> 0:2:26,786
of a historic pre-World War I
building.


55
0:2:26,786 --> 0:2:28,387
I know Segal's
going to want that.


56
0:2:28,387 --> 0:2:30,389
- Evan.
- Yeah?


57
0:2:30,389 --> 0:2:34,26
I'm sorry he asked me to be his
research assistant and not you.


58
0:2:34,26 --> 0:2:36,529
OK, well, he wants me
to help too.


59
0:2:36,529 --> 0:2:39,331
He's telling the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth, Miss Cartwright.


60
0:2:39,331 --> 0:2:40,9
I need you both.
What happened to your arm?


61
0:2:40,9 --> 0:2:42,34
Oh, it's nothing.


62
0:2:42,34 --> 0:2:43,702
- Uh-huh.
- What's going on?


63
0:2:43,702 --> 0:2:45,738
Well, the university
has been developing


64
0:2:45,738 --> 0:2:47,74
some expansion plans
for some time now


65
0:2:47,74 --> 0:2:51,544
and they want to break ground as early as
next semester on a new athletic center.


66
0:2:51,544 --> 0:2:54,513
Are they expanding
into a puppy shop?


67
0:2:54,513 --> 0:2:57,116
Sort of. See, your mock trial
case was never that mock.


68
0:2:57,116 --> 0:3:1,654
CRU is acquiring some properties,
a few vacated residences


69
0:3:1,654 --> 0:3:5,724
and a blighted fraternity house, which
they plan to tear down in two days.


70
0:3:5,724 --> 0:3:8,627
- A blighted fraternity house?
- Yeah, Lambda Sigma.


71
0:3:8,627 --> 0:3:10,162
Oh, thank God.


72
0:3:10,162 --> 0:3:12,598
Wait, nope, that's the safe
one. It's Kappa Tau Gamma.


73
0:3:12,598 --> 0:3:13,999
- What?
- Uh...


74
0:3:13,999 --> 0:3:16,802
I think what she means is,
what would you like us to do?


75
0:3:16,802 --> 0:3:20,72
You're both so good forecasting
opposing strategy during the mock trial,


76
0:3:20,72 --> 0:3:23,275
I want you to put yourselves
in this fraternity's shoes.


77
0:3:23,275 --> 0:3:26,145
Think about what they might try
to pull to prevent the university


78
0:3:26,145 --> 0:3:27,479
from tearing their house down.


79
0:3:27,479 --> 0:3:32,218
But, Professor Segal, that is
my boyfriend's fraternity.


80
0:3:32,218 --> 0:3:35,487
And my brother's.
I don't think I can do this.


81
0:3:35,487 --> 0:3:37,156
Don't think you can
do your job?


82
0:3:37,156 --> 0:3:39,992
How do you think your colleagues and
future professors are going to react


83
0:3:39,992 --> 0:3:43,295
to you no longer being my assistant
because of your boyfriend's fraternity?


84
0:3:43,295 --> 0:3:44,296
You'd fire me?


85
0:3:44,296 --> 0:3:46,131
The choice is yours.


86
0:3:46,131 --> 0:3:49,201
This is important to
the university and to me.


87
0:3:49,201 --> 0:3:57,254
If you want to be successful, it needs
to be important to you too. Both of you.


88
0:3:57,254 --> 0:4:7,18
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>


89
0:4:7,18 --> 0:4:8,948
OK, you know what?
This is insane.


90
0:4:8,948 --> 0:4:12,752
I mean, we can't be a part of the research
team that destroys Kappa Tau, right?


91
0:4:12,752 --> 0:4:16,723
Why not? I mean, look, it sounds like it's
going to happen with or without us, right?


92
0:4:16,723 --> 0:4:18,558
And KT's a sinking
ship, it's inevitable.


93
0:4:18,558 --> 0:4:20,793
OK, but KT means
so much to Cappie.


94
0:4:20,793 --> 0:4:22,28
Not to mention Rusty.


95
0:4:22,28 --> 0:4:25,198
OK, well, how much does
your future mean to you?


96
0:4:25,198 --> 0:4:28,768
But they'd never forgive me.
I'm going to tell them.


97
0:4:28,768 --> 0:4:31,371
All right, well do what you
want. Just lea6e me out of it.


98
0:4:31,371 --> 0:4:33,439
Come on, Evan. There isn't there
some small part of you


99
0:4:33,439 --> 0:4:35,208
that still cares about Cappie?


100
0:4:35,208 --> 0:4:41,414
Why can't you just let it go?


101
0:4:41,414 --> 0:4:43,516
Because I'm not interested
in pissing off Segal,


102
0:4:43,516 --> 0:4:45,652
or the university
for some stupid fraternity.


103
0:4:45,652 --> 0:4:48,321
You pledged that
stupid fraternity.


104
0:4:48,321 --> 0:4:50,557
Yeah, and that was in the past.


105
0:4:50,557 --> 0:4:59,265
Since when did Casey Cartwright
stop thinking about her future?


106
0:4:59,265 --> 0:5:2,902
<i>Peter mentioned his dad was investing
in more land around the KT house.</i>


107
0:5:2,902 --> 0:5:5,538
Now why would Lasker Parkes
Incorporated buy up all these lots?


108
0:5:5,538 --> 0:5:7,774
Maybe it's not just renovation,
but expansion.


109
0:5:7,774 --> 0:5:9,309
Maybe you guys
are getting a pool!


110
0:5:9,309 --> 0:5:11,44
Hey, working girl.


111
0:5:11,44 --> 0:5:12,946
Hello, boys.
Sorry I can't dawdle,


112
0:5:12,946 --> 0:5:15,982
but Clarissa and I are
checking out our new offices,


113
0:5:15,982 --> 0:5:18,451
so I better start my commute,
maybe get a latte on the way


114
0:5:18,451 --> 0:5:20,32
in my on-the-go to-go mug.


115
0:5:20,32 --> 0:5:22,55
Well, I'm psyched for you.


116
0:5:22,55 --> 0:5:24,424
Thanks. It feels good. I was
kinda adrift there for a while.


117
0:5:24,424 --> 0:5:27,393
Me, too. But... hey, big news.


118
0:5:27,393 --> 0:5:28,828
I've finally
picked out a major.


119
0:5:28,828 --> 0:5:29,896
- What is it?
- Really?


120
0:5:29,896 --> 0:5:32,398
Yeah. Uh, accounting!


121
0:5:32,398 --> 0:5:33,399
Oh.


122
0:5:33,399 --> 0:5:34,5
Oh.


123
0:5:34,5 --> 0:5:37,7
No, it's good.
It's practical, you know?


124
0:5:37,7 --> 0:5:39,973
The business sector is robust.
Not recession-proof but...


125
0:5:39,973 --> 0:5:41,941
And you love it. Right?


126
0:5:41,941 --> 0:5:46,379
Yeah, I mean, yeah, you know,
I will. I do.


127
0:5:46,379 --> 0:5:48,615
- Yeah!
- OK. So, yay!


128
0:5:48,615 --> 0:5:53,486
Ashleigh, before you leave,
I got you a little something.


129
0:5:53,486 --> 0:6:1,828
It's for your office,
so everybody knows your name.


130
0:6:1,828 --> 0:6:2,795
You hate it?


131
0:6:2,795 --> 0:6:6,332
No, I love it.
It's just so...


132
0:6:6,332 --> 0:6:10,37
...grown-up serious.


133
0:6:10,37 --> 0:6:17,176
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.


134
0:6:17,176 --> 0:6:22,115
- OK, bye.
- Bye.


135
0:6:22,115 --> 0:6:23,383
You still like her.


136
0:6:23,383 --> 0:6:25,652
I like giving her presents.
Big deal.


137
0:6:25,652 --> 0:6:27,387
Oh my gosh, wait,


138
0:6:27,387 --> 0:6:30,69
you gave her that taxicab not-rape whistle
when she went to New York, right?


139
0:6:30,69 --> 0:6:32,659
How long have you had
these feelings for Ashleigh?


140
0:6:32,659 --> 0:6:35,862
Well, it doesn't matter 'cause
nothing's ever gonna happen.


141
0:6:35,862 --> 0:6:37,664
I'm sorry, man.


142
0:6:37,664 --> 0:6:40,333
Whatever. It's just...
you know, it's stupid.


143
0:6:40,333 --> 0:6:42,135
I'm stupid.


144
0:6:42,135 --> 0:6:45,438
To even think...
whoa, wait, oh my God.


145
0:6:45,438 --> 0:6:50,43
- What?
- I don't think KT's getting a pool.


146
0:6:50,43 --> 0:6:51,644
Vince lavaliered Betsy
last night!


147
0:6:51,644 --> 0:6:52,912
He hid it in her chili dog!


148
0:6:52,912 --> 0:6:55,882
I almost choked and died.
It was so worth it!


149
0:6:55,882 --> 0:6:58,251
What a waste of
a perfectly good chili dog.


150
0:6:58,251 --> 0:7:0,286
Hey!


151
0:7:0,286 --> 0:7:1,421
Happy couples make me sick.


152
0:7:1,421 --> 0:7:2,689
True dat.


153
0:7:2,689 --> 0:7:4,824
My second cousin Barry
got married last weekend.


154
0:7:4,824 --> 0:7:6,559
He hadn't left the house
in five years.


155
0:7:6,559 --> 0:7:8,428
So why am I hard up right now?


156
0:7:8,428 --> 0:7:10,43
If he can find
Mrs. Barry Kettlewell...


157
0:7:10,43 --> 0:7:13,199
Well, look at me.
An extremely hot ZBZ president,


158
0:7:13,199 --> 0:7:14,6
and I'm totally dateless.


159
0:7:14,6 --> 0:7:17,804
I couldn't make it last with
Cappie or Evan. Or a girl.


160
0:7:17,804 --> 0:7:18,971
Girls aren't any easier.


161
0:7:18,971 --> 0:7:22,342
I've been dumped
by a landlord and Laura.


162
0:7:22,342 --> 0:7:23,976
You don't think we're
the problem, do you?


163
0:7:23,976 --> 0:7:27,146
Hey. Remember that terrible
Matthew McConaughey film?


164
0:7:27,146 --> 0:7:31,5
<i>Sahara</i> ? <i>Ed TV</i>?
<i>The Wedding Planner</i>?


165
0:7:31,5 --> 0:7:34,387
<i>Failure to Launch</i>?
<i>How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days</i>?


166
0:7:34,387 --> 0:7:37,557
- <i>Fool's Gold</i>?
- No.


167
0:7:37,557 --> 0:7:39,125
<i>Ghosts of Girlfriends Past.</i>


168
0:7:39,125 --> 0:7:41,527
He revisited his exes
and learned what went wrong.


169
0:7:41,527 --> 0:7:51,437
Forget it.


170
0:7:51,437 --> 0:8:3,349
Fine.


171
0:8:3,349 --> 0:8:5,17
Ooh!


172
0:8:5,17 --> 0:8:7,86
Oh Crap! Hey, sorry.


173
0:8:7,86 --> 0:8:9,956
Better tell Lasker we're
gonna need a new TV.


174
0:8:9,956 --> 0:8:12,492
Hey, Cap, I got really bad news.


175
0:8:12,492 --> 0:8:13,793
You broke the flat screen?


176
0:8:13,793 --> 0:8:17,663
Plug that in,
it might still work.


177
0:8:17,663 --> 0:8:19,866
- Oh!
- Sorry.


178
0:8:19,866 --> 0:8:22,368
This is gonna be
the easiest move ever.


179
0:8:22,368 --> 0:8:23,87
OK, um...


180
0:8:23,87 --> 0:8:25,805
Hey, guys, I have
really bad news.


181
0:8:25,805 --> 0:8:28,107
- You broke the bottle tank?
- Well my news is a lot worse.


182
0:8:28,107 --> 0:8:30,81
Trust me it pales in comparison
to what I'm going to say to you.


183
0:8:30,81 --> 0:8:33,579
- You can't just walk in here...
- Do not shoot the messenger...


184
0:8:33,579 --> 0:8:35,47
Kids!


185
0:8:35,47 --> 0:8:36,949
This is why daddy drinks.


186
0:8:36,949 --> 0:8:39,919
OK, I was researching Lasker
Parkes Incorporated


187
0:8:39,919 --> 0:8:43,222
and I found some geological
surveys of our area


188
0:8:43,222 --> 0:8:45,258
and I think he's buying up
land around us


189
0:8:45,258 --> 0:8:47,46
because we're sitting on oil.


190
0:8:47,46 --> 0:8:49,328
Lasker Parkes
is buying up land?


191
0:8:49,328 --> 0:8:51,998
- For oil.
- No, it's not for oil.


192
0:8:51,998 --> 0:8:56,68
He's donating the land to the university,
because they want to build an athletic center.


193
0:8:56,68 --> 0:8:59,972
And... they're going to tear
down your house to do it.


194
0:8:59,972 --> 0:9:1,841
They're going to tear us down?


195
0:9:1,841 --> 0:9:3,81
- Lasker?
- Yeah.


196
0:9:3,81 --> 0:9:7,58
Well, he... He knew about
our secret rush party,


197
0:9:7,58 --> 0:9:9,15
and our fake philanthropy.


198
0:9:9,15 --> 0:9:11,984
Hell, he created Joshua Whopper.


199
0:9:11,984 --> 0:9:16,656
- Lasker is Villain X.
- Are you sure about this?


200
0:9:16,656 --> 0:9:19,859
Segal put Evan and me on the
university's legal research team.


201
0:9:19,859 --> 0:9:24,3
Oh. Well, are you staying on?


202
0:9:24,3 --> 0:9:28,134
Cap, this is my future.
It's just research.


203
0:9:28,134 --> 0:9:31,571
Research that they're using to
help tear down our house.


204
0:9:31,571 --> 0:9:34,907
I'm so sorry. I...


205
0:9:34,907 --> 0:9:43,282
I get it. I'll handle
our side of things.


206
0:9:43,282 --> 0:9:45,17
Hey, what are you going to do,
Spitter?


207
0:9:45,17 --> 0:9:46,752
- Good one, Cap.
- No, I'm serious.


208
0:9:46,752 --> 0:9:50,22
I have my philosophy final to worry about
and you're acting president, so...


209
0:9:50,22 --> 0:9:53,192
So what? First of all, it's
an oration, it's not a final.


210
0:9:53,192 --> 0:9:55,127
Second, since when
do you care about grades?


211
0:9:55,127 --> 0:9:57,864
I'm gonna worry about
the house GPA, I'm the nerd.


212
0:9:57,864 --> 0:10:0,766
But you've been wanting to take the reigns
since the beginning of the semester.


213
0:10:0,766 --> 0:10:4,3
But this isn't saving parties
or stealing goats.


214
0:10:4,3 --> 0:10:6,739
If we lose our house, Nationals
said they'll shut us down.


215
0:10:6,739 --> 0:10:9,976
You're the president.
You are KT.


216
0:10:9,976 --> 0:10:12,411
You're the only one
who can do this.


217
0:10:12,411 --> 0:10:17,783
Cap...


218
0:10:17,783 --> 0:10:24,497
Well, I guess I'm the only one.


219
0:10:24,497 --> 0:10:27,266
We should get,
like a million balloons,


220
0:10:27,266 --> 0:10:29,835
and tie them to the house,
and move it.


221
0:10:29,835 --> 0:10:31,337
I think I saw it on <i>20/20</i> once.


222
0:10:31,337 --> 0:10:33,372
Yeah, I saw that episode.
It totally worked.


223
0:10:33,372 --> 0:10:37,643
What did old <i>90210</i> do
to save the Peach Pit?


224
0:10:37,643 --> 0:10:40,346
Maybe we should try something
a little more in the box.


225
0:10:40,346 --> 0:10:51,223
The house is a box...


226
0:10:51,223 --> 0:10:54,927
I'm so sorry, guys.
I had no idea. I swear.


227
0:10:54,927 --> 0:10:58,864
We believe you. Right, Cap?


228
0:10:58,864 --> 0:11:2,34
You can't blame Luke Skywalker
for being Darth Vader's son.


229
0:11:2,34 --> 0:11:5,237
- Spoiler alert.
- Hey, maybe you can talk to your dad?


230
0:11:5,237 --> 0:11:6,238
Change his mind?


231
0:11:6,238 --> 0:11:8,874
About business? No way.


232
0:11:8,874 --> 0:11:11,911
I don't get it. All I heard growing
up was how awesome KT was.


233
0:11:11,911 --> 0:11:13,579
Clearly, he doesn't
feel that way anymore.


234
0:11:13,579 --> 0:11:17,45
That's it! What if Lasker Parkes
forgot what it's like to be a KT?


235
0:11:17,45 --> 0:11:19,618
Yeah, like, he has
amnesia or something.


236
0:11:19,618 --> 0:11:23,422
Maybe he hit his head a long time ago, and
we just need to hit him on the head again!


237
0:11:23,422 --> 0:11:26,325
Or... maybe he just forgot
what brotherhood means.


238
0:11:26,325 --> 0:11:28,894
And we need to remind him.


239
0:11:28,894 --> 0:11:31,63
Nostalgia is a powerful thing.


240
0:11:31,63 --> 0:11:33,933
So, did your dad keep
any of his old KT stuff?


241
0:11:33,933 --> 0:11:36,602
Pictures, pledge paddles...
inflatable dolls?


242
0:11:36,602 --> 0:11:38,904
The only fraternity stuff of his
I've ever seen are in his office.


243
0:11:38,904 --> 0:11:41,607
- We're going to need 'em.
- I can't go in without him noticing.


244
0:11:41,607 --> 0:11:42,875
There's serious security.


245
0:11:42,875 --> 0:11:44,844
Corporate spying,
tech theft's a big issue.


246
0:11:44,844 --> 0:11:47,58
Well, it's about to
get even bigger...


247
0:11:47,58 --> 0:11:50,649
Pledge Spidey, bring
me the action figures...


248
0:11:50,649 --> 0:11:53,119
...and the Barbies, too!


249
0:11:53,119 --> 0:11:57,189
We're gonna need 'em all.


250
0:11:57,189 --> 0:12:0,76
After you.


251
0:12:0,76 --> 0:12:2,294
Not bad.


252
0:12:2,294 --> 0:12:6,832
Yeah, it looks like all fun and games...
bought with blood money.


253
0:12:6,832 --> 0:12:8,667
Relax. Nobody's dying.


254
0:12:8,667 --> 0:12:12,772
And how would you feel if it was the Omega
Chi house being torn down, Evan Bacon?


255
0:12:12,772 --> 0:12:14,173
What?


256
0:12:14,173 --> 0:12:17,176
It's like Kevin Bacon, but like
Ev... you know how... Yeah.


257
0:12:17,176 --> 0:12:18,577
My two star pupils.


258
0:12:18,577 --> 0:12:21,68
- A pleasure to meet you both.
- We are ready to get to work.


259
0:12:21,68 --> 0:12:24,884
Have you had lunch?
I thought we'd hit one of our organic cafes.


260
0:12:24,884 --> 0:12:26,786
Ooh. Sorry about your arm.
What happened?


261
0:12:26,786 --> 0:12:28,888
- Ah, nothing.
- This way.


262
0:12:28,888 --> 0:12:31,824
Welcome to Laskerplex.


263
0:12:31,824 --> 0:12:42,101
This enchanting world of productivity
and technological advancement...


264
0:12:42,101 --> 0:12:43,869
Oh, you know who should work
here? Rusty!


265
0:12:43,869 --> 0:12:47,106
Ah, you know who should move out
of his apartment? You.


266
0:12:47,106 --> 0:12:49,208
He really likes you. He has
apparently for some time.


267
0:12:49,208 --> 0:12:50,876
Yeah, well, I like him too.


268
0:12:50,876 --> 0:12:52,778
Then why don't you just go
out with him?


269
0:12:52,778 --> 0:12:55,848
Casey made me promise that I
wouldn't unless I was a 100% sure.


270
0:12:55,848 --> 0:12:57,483
Maybe I'm just gonna hurt him.


271
0:12:57,483 --> 0:12:59,685
Being in his life so much
might be hurting him more.


272
0:12:59,685 --> 0:13:1,62
Happy to be at Laskey.


273
0:13:1,62 --> 0:13:2,888
Woo-woo!


274
0:13:2,888 --> 0:13:5,925
With over 300 beanbags
company-wide.


275
0:13:5,925 --> 0:13:9,762
- I gotta go to the bathroom.
- I have to go, too.


276
0:13:9,762 --> 0:13:12,531
We'll just wait here.


277
0:13:12,531 --> 0:13:21,273
Do not go in there. Somebody's
got IBS and real bad aim.


278
0:13:21,273 --> 0:13:24,41
I'm afraid you'll have to hold
it 'til we reach the lap pools.


279
0:13:24,41 --> 0:13:27,913
- It's lady business.
- I might explode.


280
0:13:27,913 --> 0:13:30,216
Fine, the executive wing is
this way.


281
0:13:30,216 --> 0:13:32,585
You'll find the restroom
on your left.


282
0:13:32,585 --> 0:13:34,753
Don't talk.
Or make eye contact.


283
0:13:34,753 --> 0:13:38,457
Please be a sweetie
and wipe the seatie.


284
0:13:38,457 --> 0:13:50,2
Have I told you about our
house rabbit adoption center?


285
0:13:50,2 --> 0:13:53,305
This coffee is so good, but
how do you know that it's organic?


286
0:13:53,305 --> 0:13:55,374
Well, I picked these beans
myself.


287
0:13:55,374 --> 0:13:56,876
Oh!


288
0:13:56,876 --> 0:14:1,213
It's just, how do
you find the time?


289
0:14:1,213 --> 0:14:9,154
- That was a joke.
- It's a joke.


290
0:14:9,154 --> 0:14:12,91
- Ready to save the day?
- I think Cappie is the hero here.


291
0:14:12,91 --> 0:14:13,659
You could've handled all this,
Rus.


292
0:14:13,659 --> 0:14:17,963
I don't see why you
gave up the presidency.


293
0:14:17,963 --> 0:14:21,3
Hey, If I get caught with this ID, your
dad's going to be pretty pissed at you.


294
0:14:21,3 --> 0:14:33,812
- You sure you're good with that?
- It's my house too.


295
0:14:33,812 --> 0:14:36,248
- Uh, could you take o picture?
- Oh, of course, sir.


296
0:14:36,248 --> 0:14:38,584
- Photos aren't allowed.
- Thanks.


297
0:14:38,584 --> 0:14:40,586
Oh, wow.


298
0:14:40,586 --> 0:14:43,556
Perfect.


299
0:14:43,556 --> 0:14:47,726
Lost a contact. Sorry.


300
0:14:47,726 --> 0:14:49,995
Is that the same girl
that you went in there with?


301
0:14:49,995 --> 0:14:53,132
- Of course she is.
- What?


302
0:14:53,132 --> 0:14:58,103
That's definitely the same girl
whom I've never met before.


303
0:14:58,103 --> 0:15:0,105
Quickly this way people.


304
0:15:0,105 --> 0:15:2,808
Like baby birds.
I'm the momma let's do this.


305
0:15:2,808 --> 0:15:6,345
I'm totally serious. I was told Mr. Parkes
is screaming for you in Conference Room Fauna.


306
0:15:6,345 --> 0:15:8,347
And I'm supposed to
cover your phones.


307
0:15:8,347 --> 0:15:16,155
Not again.
I'll be right back.


308
0:15:16,155 --> 0:15:29,835
- Well done.
- Oh, Thanks. Go, I'll sit guard.


309
0:15:29,835 --> 0:15:31,604
Well, It should be smooth
sailing, Mr. Parkes.


310
0:15:31,604 --> 0:15:34,173
You own the property, you have
all the necessary permits.


311
0:15:34,173 --> 0:15:35,374
The law's completely
on your side.


312
0:15:35,374 --> 0:15:38,11
But I'm more concerned
about unlawful activists.


313
0:15:38,11 --> 0:15:40,312
<i>What are we up against?</i>


314
0:15:40,312 --> 0:15:45,618
Knowing KT, they'll probably try tying a million
balloons to the house and float it away.


315
0:15:45,618 --> 0:15:48,42
What about you, Miss
Cartwright? What do you think?


316
0:15:48,42 --> 0:15:53,792
Well, I'd imagine there will be
some kind of protest rally.


317
0:15:53,792 --> 0:15:56,895
They could contact the school
paper, or local news stations.


318
0:15:56,895 --> 0:16:1,333
However, per Rardin v. O'Toole,
they'd be trespassing.


319
0:16:1,333 --> 0:16:4,97
You know you own that land, you
could have them forcibly removed.


320
0:16:4,97 --> 0:16:7,973
Sorry, my assistant is not
at her desk, which is strange.


321
0:16:7,973 --> 0:16:15,914
And a little unacceptable. I'm gonna
run up to the office. Excuse me, guys.


322
0:16:15,914 --> 0:16:20,486
God, he's going to
be up here any second.


323
0:16:20,486 --> 0:16:23,956
- Bingo.
- Yes!


324
0:16:23,956 --> 0:16:25,457
Hillary?


325
0:16:25,457 --> 0:16:32,765
Oh my God, go!


326
0:16:32,765 --> 0:16:35,868
Yeah, It's Lasker, where is my
assistant? Lasker.


327
0:16:35,868 --> 0:16:45,426
Lasker Parkes,
how many Lasker's are there?


328
0:16:45,426 --> 0:16:47,361
They're like robots,
or Terminators,


329
0:16:47,361 --> 0:16:51,666
sent from the future to destroy
our house without any remorse.


330
0:16:51,666 --> 0:16:53,901
- I'm one of 'they'.
- But you are 'you',


331
0:16:53,901 --> 0:16:56,404
Even though you're part of
'they', they're the 'they'.


332
0:16:56,404 --> 0:16:57,738
I hate helping 'they'.


333
0:16:57,738 --> 0:16:59,874
Well, you're pretty good at it.
Maybe a little too good.


334
0:16:59,874 --> 0:17:1,609
I don't want to be good at
something like this,


335
0:17:1,609 --> 0:17:3,644
that I don't agree with
or believe in.


336
0:17:3,644 --> 0:17:9,884
I know how much
the house means to you.


337
0:17:9,884 --> 0:17:13,2
There's something else
we need to talk about.


338
0:17:13,2 --> 0:17:15,69
What's this?


339
0:17:15,69 --> 0:17:18,259
Over the past five years I took
so many different classes


340
0:17:18,259 --> 0:17:22,163
and had so many different
majors. I kinda lost track.


341
0:17:22,163 --> 0:17:26,67
And, this letter explains
that, um...


342
0:17:26,67 --> 0:17:28,936
...I can graduate.


343
0:17:28,936 --> 0:17:31,238
This semester.


344
0:17:31,238 --> 0:17:38,212
You accidentally graduated?
That's great!


345
0:17:38,212 --> 0:17:39,58
Or is it?


346
0:17:39,58 --> 0:17:44,218
Well, I was waiting to surprise
you, and to see if I passed


347
0:17:44,218 --> 0:17:47,354
but now, I'm not so sure
if I can.


348
0:17:47,354 --> 0:17:48,823
Because of the fraternity.


349
0:17:48,823 --> 0:17:50,958
I thought Rusty could
take over. I don't get it.


350
0:17:50,958 --> 0:17:52,593
- I think he's scared.
- So am I,


351
0:17:52,593 --> 0:17:54,729
but that's not going to save KT.


352
0:17:54,729 --> 0:17:59,5
I mean, that house...
it's kinda where I grew up.


353
0:17:59,5 --> 0:18:2,103
You have grown-up.


354
0:18:2,103 --> 0:18:5,906
Right now I feel like the only
person who can save it.


355
0:18:5,906 --> 0:18:10,211
If I go, so does Kappa Tau.


356
0:18:10,211 --> 0:18:14,115
It's funny. I've spent
most of college


357
0:18:14,115 --> 0:18:16,851
feeling like the KT house
was the 'other woman',


358
0:18:16,851 --> 0:18:19,386
knowing I'd have to share you.


359
0:18:19,386 --> 0:18:22,923
If this doesn't work out
tomorrow...


360
0:18:22,923 --> 0:18:25,726
...tonight's her last night.


361
0:18:25,726 --> 0:18:29,463
I get it.


362
0:18:29,463 --> 0:18:38,706
Go to her.


363
0:18:38,706 --> 0:18:44,545
Thank you.


364
0:18:44,545 --> 0:18:46,781
So, I got an e-mail from Robin.


365
0:18:46,781 --> 0:18:49,216
She claims we didn't work out
because I'm not a lesbian.


366
0:18:49,216 --> 0:18:51,552
Despite your masculine energy.


367
0:18:51,552 --> 0:18:54,555
Which leaves me with Cappie,
who's way busy with Kappa Tau.


368
0:18:54,555 --> 0:18:56,49
And Evan, who I'm
saving for last.


369
0:18:56,49 --> 0:18:58,726
Kind of dreading that one.


370
0:18:58,726 --> 0:19:7,668
Yeah, I'm saving Laura for last.


371
0:19:7,668 --> 0:19:10,604
Or you could rip off the
Band-Aid.


372
0:19:10,604 --> 0:19:13,374
OK. All right here we go.


373
0:19:13,374 --> 0:19:15,609
- A little privacy?
- Right.


374
0:19:15,609 --> 0:19:22,416
Ladies, could you excuse us?


375
0:19:22,416 --> 0:19:26,287
OK.


376
0:19:26,287 --> 0:19:28,255
What?


377
0:19:28,255 --> 0:19:30,191
Why didn't we ever work out?


378
0:19:30,191 --> 0:19:32,393
You don't like to sweat.


379
0:19:32,393 --> 0:19:40,534
No, I mean...
like our relationship.


380
0:19:40,534 --> 0:19:43,137
Did we even have a relationship?


381
0:19:43,137 --> 0:19:49,9
- Never mind.
- Because I wish we did.


382
0:19:49,9 --> 0:19:53,214
You do?


383
0:19:53,214 --> 0:20:19,94
Oh, come on!


384
0:20:19,94 --> 0:20:25,713
Spitter?


385
0:20:25,713 --> 0:20:27,414
What are you doing here?


386
0:20:27,414 --> 0:20:34,255
Probably the same
thing you are.


387
0:20:34,255 --> 0:20:41,528
So I'm guessing you'll confront Lasker
tomorrow morning, at the protest.


388
0:20:41,528 --> 0:20:44,531
You know, I'm not very proud
of the way that I backed out


389
0:20:44,531 --> 0:20:46,767
as interim president.


390
0:20:46,767 --> 0:20:50,404
I thought you wanted
to lead the house.


391
0:20:50,404 --> 0:20:54,108
When I came to CRU, I didn't
know how to have fun.


392
0:20:54,108 --> 0:21:2,349
Having Kappa Tau in my life
changed all that.


393
0:21:2,349 --> 0:21:5,252
But without it, I'm just gonna
go back to being same old


394
0:21:5,252 --> 0:21:9,323
nerdy Crusty Cartwright.


395
0:21:9,323 --> 0:21:17,298
This house is way too important
for me to take over.


396
0:21:17,298 --> 0:21:26,24
It's a good thing we're not
going to lose it then.


397
0:21:26,24 --> 0:21:35,616
Guys?


398
0:21:35,616 --> 0:21:38,319
We just thought it'd be fun to
get trashed here one more time.


399
0:21:38,319 --> 0:22:2,109
One last round.


400
0:22:2,109 --> 0:22:6,947
So, is this it?


401
0:22:6,947 --> 0:22:9,683
We're coming to you live
from Cyprus-Rhodes University's


402
0:22:9,683 --> 0:22:15,622
infamous Greek row, where a student
rally is taking place to save...


403
0:22:15,622 --> 0:22:19,893
I'm disgusted by what they're trying
to do to you guys, Mr. Cappie.


404
0:22:19,893 --> 0:22:22,296
Back up, knucklehead!


405
0:22:22,296 --> 0:22:24,498
- Wade!
- What are you doing here?


406
0:22:24,498 --> 0:22:25,899
KT forever!


407
0:22:25,899 --> 0:22:28,335
And my parents finally kicked me
out of their basement,


408
0:22:28,335 --> 0:22:31,238
so I'm looking for a place
to crash for a few weeks.


409
0:22:31,238 --> 0:22:33,173
- So let's save this house!
- You got it, bud.


410
0:22:33,173 --> 0:22:37,277
- So good to see you, buddy.
- Yeah, you too!


411
0:22:37,277 --> 0:22:39,179
Whoa, check, here we go.


412
0:22:39,179 --> 0:22:47,921
Hi, I'm Cappie.
President of Kappa Tau Gamma.


413
0:22:47,921 --> 0:22:51,492
I just want to thank
every one of you for coming out


414
0:22:51,492 --> 0:22:59,4
to support the preservation
of our beloved home.


415
0:22:59,4 --> 0:23:4,271
Now this house is a time
capsule for many, many...


416
0:23:4,271 --> 0:23:7,808
...many parties and personal
college stories.


417
0:23:7,808 --> 0:23:14,14
Now, does anyone want to share
a KT story with us?


418
0:23:14,14 --> 0:23:16,16
- Great, thank you.
- All right.


419
0:23:16,16 --> 0:23:20,721
Hi, my name is Katherine Parker, I am former
Pan-Hellenic President and Gamma Psi alum.


420
0:23:20,721 --> 0:23:23,624
Thank you. Thank you.


421
0:23:23,624 --> 0:23:32,633
This house is especially important to me
because this is where I lost my virginity.


422
0:23:32,633 --> 0:23:36,17
It was like two months ago!


423
0:23:36,17 --> 0:23:41,942
So, how many of you guys lost
your virginity at this house?


424
0:23:41,942 --> 0:23:44,178
Ok.


425
0:23:44,178 --> 0:23:45,779
Does it matter which virginity
you lost?


426
0:23:45,779 --> 0:23:49,55
Anyone else? Yes?


427
0:23:49,55 --> 0:23:50,951
- Lisa Lawson.
- Hi.


428
0:23:50,951 --> 0:23:57,524
OK. And how many of you
lost it to me?


429
0:23:57,524 --> 0:24:0,194
Oh, my word.


430
0:24:0,194 --> 0:24:2,83
- Ok.
- Thanks. Anyone else?


431
0:24:2,83 --> 0:24:5,632
Oh all right, yes.


432
0:24:5,632 --> 0:24:10,37
Hi. I'm Jennifer Kenney, Editor in Chief of
the <i>Cyprus-Rhodes Courier.</i>


433
0:24:10,37 --> 0:24:12,306
Oh, you'll be happy to know
I took your advice.


434
0:24:12,306 --> 0:24:15,175
Finally. Wow, Rus
is a really lucky guy.


435
0:24:15,175 --> 0:24:17,878
Oh no, not that advice.
The moving out part.


436
0:24:17,878 --> 0:24:20,481
I put down a deposit on an
apartment last night.


437
0:24:20,481 --> 0:24:22,983
Oh, taking the safe road.


438
0:24:22,983 --> 0:24:25,519
Uh, you should know.
Accounting.


439
0:24:25,519 --> 0:24:29,389
When I was a freshman, I wrote
a scathing yet award-winning


440
0:24:29,389 --> 0:24:32,292
indictment on the Greek system
that I have now come to regret.


441
0:24:32,292 --> 0:24:40,367
In my article, I attacked the common practices
of this two- century-old tradition.


442
0:24:40,367 --> 0:24:42,436
Hey, everyone. My name
is Lasker Parkes,


443
0:24:42,436 --> 0:24:49,376
and I guess you could say I'm the
one responsible for all this.


444
0:24:49,376 --> 0:24:56,35
All right, all right.


445
0:24:56,35 --> 0:25:5,559
All children grow up.


446
0:25:5,559 --> 0:25:10,23
Dad, please don't do this.


447
0:25:10,23 --> 0:25:12,599
Son, it is just a house.


448
0:25:12,599 --> 0:25:15,936
But it was your house, too.


449
0:25:15,936 --> 0:25:19,206
Remember this?


450
0:25:19,206 --> 0:25:21,341
Brother Falken?


451
0:25:21,341 --> 0:25:24,11
Falken? Pretty big <i>WarGames</i> fan,
right?


452
0:25:24,11 --> 0:25:25,212
You were in my office?


453
0:25:25,212 --> 0:25:28,15
In <i>WarGames,</i> the nerd
got to be the hero.


454
0:25:28,15 --> 0:25:30,117
Which isn't always the case.


455
0:25:30,117 --> 0:25:33,587
- That's very informative, Rusty.
- The name's Spitter.


456
0:25:33,587 --> 0:25:35,389
I'm a nerd, just like you.


457
0:25:35,389 --> 0:25:39,26
And KT's accepted me,
just like they accepted you.


458
0:25:39,26 --> 0:25:40,961
You can still be the hero here.


459
0:25:40,961 --> 0:25:45,98
Doesn't the spirit of KT
mean anything to you?


460
0:25:45,98 --> 0:25:46,967
Is this how you
want to be remembered?


461
0:25:46,967 --> 0:25:50,304
Rusty, when you leave college,


462
0:25:50,304 --> 0:25:53,907
this stuff doesn't go with you.


463
0:25:53,907 --> 0:25:57,444
None of this matters.
This athletic center though...


464
0:25:57,444 --> 0:26:2,716
...this will be my legacy.


465
0:26:2,716 --> 0:26:6,62
Now, we're all going to miss
the KT house, including me.


466
0:26:6,62 --> 0:26:10,857
But this is in the name of
making a better CRU, with a gym,


467
0:26:10,857 --> 0:26:13,86
racquetball courts, an
Olympic sized swimming pool.


468
0:26:13,86 --> 0:26:16,163
Oh really? Oh sweet!


469
0:26:16,163 --> 0:26:19,266
So, not everyone is
opposed to this idea.


470
0:26:19,266 --> 0:26:23,3
Now, I even have with me
two recent CRU grads,


471
0:26:23,3 --> 0:26:25,939
the former presidents
of ZBZ and Omega Chi,


472
0:26:25,939 --> 0:26:28,809
and they will explain to you why
this is a really good idea.


473
0:26:28,809 --> 0:26:38,385
Miss Cartwright? You're up.


474
0:26:38,385 --> 0:26:45,392
Say something.


475
0:26:45,392 --> 0:26:56,737
No.


476
0:26:56,737 --> 0:27:0,274
Casey, your legal career
hangs in the balance right now.


477
0:27:0,274 --> 0:27:1,742
Look, I'm sorry, Professor.


478
0:27:1,742 --> 0:27:3,443
But I don't want to be
remembered as the girl


479
0:27:3,443 --> 0:27:18,659
who helped tear down
the Kappa Tau house.


480
0:27:18,659 --> 0:27:19,96
It's all on you, Chambers.


481
0:27:19,96 --> 0:27:25,532
Are you going to choose your
future or your friends?


482
0:27:25,532 --> 0:27:35,242
Well, when you put it
like that...


483
0:27:35,242 --> 0:27:47,888
Thanks.


484
0:27:47,888 --> 0:27:51,291
OK.


485
0:27:51,291 --> 0:28:2,903
Tear it down, guys.


486
0:28:2,903 --> 0:28:8,608

You know, you did
all you could.


496
0:29:29,7 --> 0:29:32,36
Then why can't I help feeling
like I let the whole house down?


497
0:29:32,36 --> 0:29:34,762
And after all we went through to
get that stupid paddle.


498
0:29:34,762 --> 0:29:37,365
You were amazing, Rus.


499
0:29:37,365 --> 0:29:40,167
Seeing you stand up
to Lasker like that?


500
0:29:40,167 --> 0:29:44,305
You're not my geeky little brother who got
beat up by a sixth grader in high school.


501
0:29:44,305 --> 0:29:45,539
She was an eighth grader.


502
0:29:45,539 --> 0:29:47,441
And you heard Parkes.


503
0:29:47,441 --> 0:29:51,479
Without Kappa Tau, I'm
basically back to geeky Rusty.


504
0:29:51,479 --> 0:29:52,647
I don't believe that.


505
0:29:52,647 --> 0:29:55,816
You've changed.


506
0:29:55,816 --> 0:29:58,653
That old Rusty is gone for good.


507
0:29:58,653 --> 0:30:0,955
You know...


508
0:30:0,955 --> 0:30:8,429
You don't need me or anyone
to protect you anymore.


509
0:30:8,429 --> 0:30:12,633
You can handle yourself.


510
0:30:12,633 --> 0:30:15,903
I get that from you.


511
0:30:15,903 --> 0:30:19,307
The way you stood up to your professor,
that was pretty incredible.


512
0:30:19,307 --> 0:30:21,75
What?


513
0:30:21,75 --> 0:30:24,578
So, what are you going to do
about law school now?


514
0:30:24,578 --> 0:30:26,681
I have no idea.


515
0:30:26,681 --> 0:30:28,849
But I did the right thing.


516
0:30:28,849 --> 0:30:31,218
That's from you...


517
0:30:31,218 --> 0:30:32,52
...Jiminy Cricket.


518
0:30:32,52 --> 0:30:44,665
Come here.


519
0:30:44,665 --> 0:30:49,236
That was pretty impressive, what
you did at the Kappa Tau rally.


520
0:30:49,236 --> 0:30:50,538
You came here to tell me that?


521
0:30:50,538 --> 0:31:2,316
No. I came here
to ask you a question.


522
0:31:2,316 --> 0:31:7,421
Dale and I are doing this dumb
thing, so, I just wanted to ask:


523
0:31:7,421 --> 0:31:16,997
Why exactly did you and I
not work out?


524
0:31:16,997 --> 0:31:20,601
We couldn't work out
because I blew it.


525
0:31:20,601 --> 0:31:25,773
You know, I screwed up,
putting law school ahead of you.


526
0:31:25,773 --> 0:31:32,79
That's been something that's been
really hard for me to accept.


527
0:31:32,79 --> 0:31:34,315
What do you think
happened to my hand?


528
0:31:34,315 --> 0:31:39,92
- You got in a fight?
- With a wall.


529
0:31:39,92 --> 0:31:52,633
For what it's worth,
it's a really tough wall.


530
0:31:52,633 --> 0:31:55,436
It's Professor Segal.


531
0:31:55,436 --> 0:31:57,638
You better get that.


532
0:31:57,638 --> 0:31:59,774
Yeah.


533
0:31:59,774 --> 0:32:19,827
Good luck.


534
0:32:19,827 --> 0:32:23,197
Adios, KT.


535
0:32:23,197 --> 0:32:27,668
It was good knowing you.


536
0:32:27,668 --> 0:32:29,97
I see a lot of frowny faces!


537
0:32:29,97 --> 0:32:32,206
Spitter, we're standing in
Greek ruins. Literally.


538
0:32:32,206 --> 0:32:33,641
But you're still the president
of this house.


539
0:32:33,641 --> 0:32:35,142
Not if there's no house
to be president of.


540
0:32:35,142 --> 0:32:37,912
I'm so sorry, again, guys.


541
0:32:37,912 --> 0:32:40,381
I'm sensing a lot more family
therapy after all this.


542
0:32:40,381 --> 0:32:48,722
So Lasker grew into a bitter
nerd. So what?


543
0:32:48,722 --> 0:32:50,791
But it doesn't have
to be that way.


544
0:32:50,791 --> 0:32:53,194
He's a relic of the '80s.


545
0:32:53,194 --> 0:32:56,664
It's his generation who
tells us the real world sucks


546
0:32:56,664 --> 0:32:58,365
because they make it sucky.


547
0:32:58,365 --> 0:33:0,668
But he was right
about one thing.


548
0:33:0,668 --> 0:33:2,403
This was just a house.


549
0:33:2,403 --> 0:33:4,171
Kappa Tau isn't one person.


550
0:33:4,171 --> 0:33:8,75
Kappa tau isn't wood, it isn't
dry-rot, it isn't moldy wallpaper,


551
0:33:8,75 --> 0:33:9,743
it isn't beer-soaked carpets.


552
0:33:9,743 --> 0:33:13,514
It's living for the fun of life.
And that's what bonds us.


553
0:33:13,514 --> 0:33:18,486
As long as we remember that,
Kappa Tau lives on,


554
0:33:18,486 --> 0:33:24,158
past houses, past college.


555
0:33:24,158 --> 0:33:25,559
So, what do we do now, Spitter?


556
0:33:25,559 --> 0:33:29,163
Anybody who still has finals
to take... go study now.


557
0:33:29,163 --> 0:33:31,765
We're gonna have to get our
GPA up going into next semester.


558
0:33:31,765 --> 0:33:33,534
But where are we
gonna live then?


559
0:33:33,534 --> 0:33:35,135
We can't sleep in tents
all winter.


560
0:33:35,135 --> 0:33:37,4
In case you forgot,
this is Ohio.


561
0:33:37,4 --> 0:33:40,941
I'm gonna find a new house over break.
A better one. With working toilets.


562
0:33:40,941 --> 0:33:44,879
- Can I crash there?
- Absolutely!


563
0:33:44,879 --> 0:33:48,48
No more moping around. Get up!


564
0:33:48,48 --> 0:33:49,183
Let's go!


565
0:33:49,183 --> 0:34:6,0
Spit-ter!
Spit-ter! Spit-ter!


566
0:34:6,0 --> 0:34:9,236
Hey, what are you doing?


567
0:34:9,236 --> 0:34:12,439
I haven't been in here
since I left for New York.


568
0:34:12,439 --> 0:34:15,75
You know, this room
is crazy big.


569
0:34:15,75 --> 0:34:16,577
Yeah.


570
0:34:16,577 --> 0:34:20,314
I'm meeting Cappie at Dobler's,
if you want to come.


571
0:34:20,314 --> 0:34:21,882
Nah, I'm good.


572
0:34:21,882 --> 0:34:26,754
But, um, tell him
I'm sorry for his loss.


573
0:34:26,754 --> 0:34:29,189
Oh, and when you see Rusty,


574
0:34:29,189 --> 0:34:34,128
let him know that I thought it was pretty
cool how he stood up to Lasker like that.


575
0:34:34,128 --> 0:34:36,43
It was, huh?


576
0:34:36,43 --> 0:34:43,37
Um, I'll tell him you said so.


577
0:34:43,37 --> 0:34:47,508
You know... I was wrong.


578
0:34:47,508 --> 0:34:52,813
When I told you to be
careful with Rusty.


579
0:34:52,813 --> 0:35:7,895
He's a lot stronger than I gave
him credit for.


580
0:35:7,895 --> 0:35:9,863
You should've seen Rusty today.
You would've been proud.


581
0:35:9,863 --> 0:35:12,866
I already am.


582
0:35:12,866 --> 0:35:15,469
Hey, Crappie.


583
0:35:15,469 --> 0:35:19,6
The name's Cappie.


584
0:35:19,6 --> 0:35:21,809
And thanks for
your support today.


585
0:35:21,809 --> 0:35:25,479
Yeah, well... you know, seeing
Casey make that choice.


586
0:35:25,479 --> 0:35:27,47
And join you on the other side?


587
0:35:27,47 --> 0:35:29,149
It helped me realize
what really matters.


588
0:35:29,149 --> 0:35:31,352
Segal looked pissed, huh?


589
0:35:31,352 --> 0:35:32,519
Oh, he wants to see us both.


590
0:35:32,519 --> 0:35:34,21
I bet he does.


591
0:35:34,21 --> 0:35:37,424
I guess it's time
to start groveling.


592
0:35:37,424 --> 0:35:41,161
I'm not going to.


593
0:35:41,161 --> 0:35:43,664
I don't want to have to
compromise what I believe in.


594
0:35:43,664 --> 0:35:48,168
Law school, or defending Evil Corp
or Lasker Parkes, or whomever.


595
0:35:48,168 --> 0:35:50,571
It's not me.


596
0:35:50,571 --> 0:35:52,74
What am I supposed to do now?


597
0:35:52,74 --> 0:35:59,98
Go to Washington,
no law degree? No plan?


598
0:35:59,98 --> 0:36:5,886
Why the hell not?


599
0:36:5,886 --> 0:36:10,858
Yeah... why the hell not?
I'll go with you.


600
0:36:10,858 --> 0:36:13,93
I got one more final to pass,
then I can graduate.


601
0:36:13,93 --> 0:36:15,29
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You can graduate?


602
0:36:15,29 --> 0:36:17,564
- Accidentally.
- What?


603
0:36:17,564 --> 0:36:21,902
- What about KT? - After today, I'm pretty
sure Rusty can handle it.


604
0:36:21,902 --> 0:36:36,55
We'll figure it out together.


605
0:36:36,55 --> 0:36:38,719
As it should be.


606
0:36:38,719 --> 0:36:40,621
There's just one problem.


607
0:36:40,621 --> 0:36:42,523
I've barely studied
for my last class.


608
0:36:42,523 --> 0:36:43,957
- Then we should get going!
- Go!


609
0:36:43,957 --> 0:36:47,227
- Are you...
- Yeah, yeah, go.


610
0:36:47,227 --> 0:36:53,1
Bye!

615
0:37:8,682 --> 0:37:9,983
So, you're moving out.


616
0:37:9,983 --> 0:37:12,686
Couldn't live on the futon
forever, huh?


617
0:37:12,686 --> 0:37:15,222
Yeah.


618
0:37:15,222 --> 0:37:17,858
Well, I have a rule that
I don't date roommates.


619
0:37:17,858 --> 0:37:22,596
It's kind of a new rule, since
I've only ever lived with girls.


620
0:37:22,596 --> 0:37:26,333
Mostly your sister, and this
really big rat in New York.


621
0:37:26,333 --> 0:37:29,503
Neither of whom I
wanted to date. But...


622
0:37:29,503 --> 0:37:32,539
...now.


623
0:37:32,539 --> 0:37:37,745
You want to date me?


624
0:37:37,745 --> 0:37:57,249
<i>♪ We are always living</i>
<i>in twilight ♪</i>


625
0:37:57,249 --> 0:38:0,352
Can you just wait two more minutes?
I know Cappie will be here any second.


626
0:38:0,352 --> 0:38:3,889
'The only true wisdom is in knowing
you know nothing.' Socrates.


627
0:38:3,889 --> 0:38:7,593
OK, well, Socrates didn't text.


628
0:38:7,593 --> 0:38:9,61
I'm here! I'm here!
I'm sorry!


629
0:38:9,61 --> 0:38:14,399
I overslept because
I was up all night preparing,


630
0:38:14,399 --> 0:38:17,503
and then my house was torn down,


631
0:38:17,503 --> 0:38:20,639
and I, I just, I need this
credit to graduate.


632
0:38:20,639 --> 0:38:27,646
Class is over. I'm afraid
you have no more time.


633
0:38:27,646 --> 0:38:33,819
But what is time?


634
0:38:33,819 --> 0:38:37,156
I see you've been
paying attention.


635
0:38:37,156 --> 0:38:41,393
OK... you can present.


636
0:38:41,393 --> 0:38:44,363
For your final,
I just have one question.


637
0:38:44,363 --> 0:38:45,497
Why?


638
0:38:45,497 --> 0:38:52,771
Because you're lazy?
I'm just joking.


639
0:38:52,771 --> 0:38:56,608
Well, the first thing you asked us at
the beginning of the semester was,


640
0:38:56,608 --> 0:38:57,643
'Why are we here?'


641
0:38:57,643 --> 0:38:59,778
Well, I thought about that.
A lot.


642
0:38:59,778 --> 0:39:2,14
We all have a purpose.


643
0:39:2,14 --> 0:39:5,117
And our purpose is to
figure out our purpose.


644
0:39:5,117 --> 0:39:6,385
That's what college is.


645
0:39:6,385 --> 0:39:10,222
<i>So why college? Why CRU?</i>


646
0:39:10,222 --> 0:39:14,56
<i>The truth is, I chose CRU because a
friend of mine from camp was going here.</i>


647
0:39:14,56 --> 0:39:17,296
<i>Then I chose to rush a fraternity,
and I made new friends,</i>


648
0:39:17,296 --> 0:39:22,34
<i>and college has been everything</i> <i>I
could've ever imagined it to be...</i>


649
0:39:22,34 --> 0:39:23,202
<i>so I kept thinking,</i>


650
0:39:23,202 --> 0:39:25,7
<i>why would I ever</i>
<i>want to leave this place?</i>


651
0:39:25,7 --> 0:39:28,14
<i>But then I realized...</i>


652
0:39:28,14 --> 0:39:30,943
...that there's so much left
to learn, and experience,


653
0:39:30,943 --> 0:39:32,177
<i>and look forward to.</i>


654
0:39:32,177 --> 0:39:36,648
<i>And now I'm graduating...</i>
<i>hopefully...</i>


655
0:39:36,648 --> 0:39:39,51
<i>...and heading out into the real
world with the love of my life,</i>


656
0:39:39,51 --> 0:39:40,586
<i>who was my purpose.</i>


657
0:39:40,586 --> 0:39:44,223
So, today, I'm here to graduate.


658
0:39:44,223 --> 0:39:46,425
<i>And tomorrow?</i>
<i>Well, that's har$ to say,</i>


659
0:39:46,425 --> 0:39:49,828
<i>because I have no idea</i>
<i>where I'll be.</i>


660
0:39:49,828 --> 0:39:54,499
Nice hat.


661
0:39:54,499 --> 0:39:56,668
This is your real name?


662
0:39:56,668 --> 0:40:0,305
"Captain John Paul Jones"?


663
0:40:0,305 --> 0:40:1,74
How did we never know that?


664
0:40:1,74 --> 0:40:4,476
Congratulations, Cappie. This is
an emotional day for all of us.


665
0:40:4,476 --> 0:40:8,647
I guess we should drink
to KT's newest alum.


666
0:40:8,647 --> 0:40:10,649
Oh.


667
0:40:10,649 --> 0:40:12,84
And to Calvin!


668
0:40:12,84 --> 0:40:14,82
We're gonna miss you
next semester.


669
0:40:14,82 --> 0:40:17,623
You're going abroad, right?
Going to help people.


670
0:40:17,623 --> 0:40:19,791
Yeah, we leave for India the
first week of the new year.


671
0:40:19,791 --> 0:40:21,159
Not playing it safe.


672
0:40:21,159 --> 0:40:22,16
Hey.


673
0:40:22,16 --> 0:40:23,729
Best way to play.


674
0:40:23,729 --> 0:40:28,934
Dale lavaliered me!


675
0:40:28,934 --> 0:40:30,235
I brought this here as well.


676
0:40:30,235 --> 0:40:32,704
Oh, you didn't.


677
0:40:32,704 --> 0:40:38,777
- And this!
- Oh my God!


678
0:40:38,777 --> 0:40:41,246
They say that that if you sit
in it and it fits,


679
0:40:41,246 --> 0:40:43,348
you're KT president.


680
0:40:43,348 --> 0:40:46,418
Go ahead, try it out.


681
0:40:46,418 --> 0:40:48,32
Do a test drive there.


682
0:40:48,32 --> 0:40:51,189
Test it out.


683
0:40:51,189 --> 0:40:53,58
Oh!


684
0:40:53,58 --> 0:40:56,261
And the transfer of power
is complete!


685
0:40:56,261 --> 0:40:59,965
You are my legacy, Spitter.


686
0:40:59,965 --> 0:41:5,804
Here's to the new KT president.


687
0:41:5,804 --> 0:41:7,739
Shots! Shots! Shots!


688
0:41:7,739 --> 0:41:14,513
And to Cappie! The best...


689
0:41:14,513 --> 0:41:19,918
Long live KT!


690
0:41:19,918 --> 0:41:21,787
- Cheers.
- Cheers.


691
0:41:21,787 --> 0:41:28,393
Yeah!


692
0:41:28,393 --> 0:41:31,763
I'm sorry I'm leaving again.


693
0:41:31,763 --> 0:41:33,665
Well, I'm not
following you this time.


694
0:41:33,665 --> 0:41:38,103
I have my own apartment,
my own job.


695
0:41:38,103 --> 0:41:40,439
And a new relationship.


696
0:41:40,439 --> 0:41:46,211
Take care of each other.


697
0:41:46,211 --> 0:41:48,747
I can't believe you're
making me hire a new house mom.


698
0:41:48,747 --> 0:41:55,22
Oh, I will miss the sorority.


699
0:41:55,22 --> 0:41:57,356
And you.


700
0:41:57,356 --> 0:42:6,665
I know.

at Christmas.


706
0:42:30,956 --> 0:42:34,359
Love you.


707
0:42:34,359 --> 0:42:40,65
- Bye.
- Bye.


708
0:42:40,65 --> 0:42:43,101
- Hey, keep in touch, man.
- You too.


709
0:42:43,101 --> 0:42:44,469
Thanks.


710
0:42:44,469 --> 0:42:51,977
Case.


711
0:42:51,977 --> 0:42:56,548
It arrived this morning.


712
0:42:56,548 --> 0:42:59,818
And, since you were such an integral
part of us winning the Golden Lily,


713
0:42:59,818 --> 0:43:1,19
I'd like to give it to you.


714
0:43:1,19 --> 0:43:3,188
Oh my God, I couldn't possibly.


715
0:43:3,188 --> 0:43:8,6
I said I'd like to,
not that I was going to.


716
0:43:8,6 --> 0:43:9,94
Have a safe trip.


717
0:43:9,94 --> 0:43:14,866
- Bye.
- Bye.


718
0:43:14,866 --> 0:43:18,77
Well, Dale, this is it.


719
0:43:18,77 --> 0:43:21,84
You could've been the
future Mrs. Dale Kettlewell.


720
0:43:21,84 --> 0:43:30,148
- Never forget that.
- I won't.


721
0:43:30,148 --> 0:43:33,118
Don't forget that either.


722
0:43:33,118 --> 0:43:39,858
- Dale?
- Bye, buddy.


723
0:43:39,858 --> 0:43:42,494
Take care of my sister for me,
OK?


724
0:43:42,494 --> 0:43:50,969
I promise.


725
0:43:50,969 --> 0:43:53,238
I love you, Casey.


726
0:43:53,238 --> 0:44:3,315
