###3 BRIAN ANDERSON: Oh, you know what?
###4 I almost forgot to get you a water, and I was in line, so I
###7 got you Gatorade.
###8 And there's M&Ms if you guys want some M&Ms or gum.
###11 JERRY HSU: You could do a trick to land there, maybe.
###14 BRIAN ANDERSON: I bet you could land
###15 in it anyway, still.
###18 Seems like it.
###19 Maybe it's because I have soft wheels.
###20 I'm not sure.
###23 JERRY HSU: That'd be sex with your trick
###23 and land in it anyway.
###25 BRIAN ANDERSON: I know.
###26 JERRY HSU: Because it's not skate stop.
###28 Does anyone skate it, you think?
###30 BRIAN ANDERSON: I don't know.
###30 I don't feel like people do.
###32 
###36 [GRUNTING]
###39 BRIAN ANDERSON: Shit.
###41 I'd like to roll away.
###44 JERRY HSU: That's my board.
###46 He better not break it.
###48 
###51 BRIAN ANDERSON: Oh, that fucking hurts.
###54 JERRY HSU: Oh well.
###55 
###58 BRIAN ANDERSON: That kitty litter doesn't
###58 let you land in it.
###60 
###63 BRAD STABA: We used to skate that thing every single day.
###65 We would take the BART from [INAUDIBLE]
###67 straight to [INAUDIBLE].
###69 And we would like buy a boombox and bring a fucking
###73 whatever mixtape and just push play and skate that thing like
###77 all day, smoke weed.
###80 We didn't go there with cameras, you know?
###82 PATRICK O'DELL: You would just go to session it?
###83 BRAD STABA: We would go there every single day, seriously.
###87 The thing is like he didn't go into skateboarding like, I'm
###90 going to be a pro.
###91 I'm going to get sponsored.
###92 I'm going to make this tape, and I'm going to send it to
###94 this guy and they're going to give me free shit.
###96 It just happened, you know?
###97 And if it didn't happen, he would be doing like--
###100 he'd be work for the city.
###101 He'd be work for the park.
###102 He'd be doing a normal job.
###104 Just living, you know?
###107 Now he's one of the best skateboarders ever.
###109 
###111 [GRUNTING]
###113 BRIAN ANDERSON: That's a make.
###115 I don't care.
###116 
###118 I think that's a make.
###119 PATRICK O'DELL: We'll run the photo.
###121 Did you get the photo?
###122 JERRY HSU: Yeah.
###124 It's already--
###126 I'm sending it out virally.
###129 BRIAN ANDERSON: Those rocks.
###131 
###133 Fuck.
###134 
###137 PATRICK O'DELL: What's up?
###137 Welcome back to the show.
###139 This week's about Brian Anderson.
###141 Brian is probably a little bit different than some pro
###143 skaters in that he's worked in his life full-time jobs as
###147 like a cook and all these different things.
###149 So I think he's one of those skaters that really
###151 appreciates probably being pro, because he knows what he
###154 has to go back to if he doesn't skate.
###159 The first video I remember him in was the "Welcome to Hell"
###162 Toy Machine video.
###163 He had like shaved head.
###165 This big, beastly guy who's got a lot of pop.
###170 He's really gnarly.
###171 My favorite trick Brian Anderson does is 360 flips.
###175 I wanted to do this episode to kind of get an insight into
###179 who he is as a person.
###181 So after the Beauty and the Beast tour, I went up to San
###183 Francisco to meet up with him and see what his life's like.
###187 And I don't know, I just wanted to get in his head.
###189 He seems like a really intriguing
###192 subject for the show.
###193 And so this is it, the Brian Anderson episode.
###196 Hope you like it.
###197 
###203 FEMALE SPEAKER: OK, what can I get for you?
###205 DONNY BARLEY: Yeah, I want to get the
###206 western omelette, please.
###208 FEMALE SPEAKER: OK, white, wheat, or rye?
###210 DONNY BARLEY: Wheat, please.
###212 Does that come with home fries?
###214 FEMALE SPEAKER: It does.
###215 DONNY BARLEY: Can I add bacon to the omelette?
###217 FEMALE SPEAKER: Inside it?
###217 DONNY BARLEY: Yeah.
###218 FEMALE SPEAKER: Sure.
###218 DONNY BARLEY: Thank you.
###219 FEMALE SPEAKER: You're welcome.
###221 PATRICK O'DELL: Do you come back to Carlton a lot?
###223 DONNY BARLEY: Yeah, I come back like
###225 almost every weekend.
###226 It's funny.
###227 This place is all remodeled.
###230 It looks good, but it's not the same.
###232 Me and Brian used to come here all the time late night.
###237 Just get coffees sometimes, and then get fired up and go
###241 on late-night missions and stuff.
###243 Skating, or coming back from like a punk rock show.
###246 This is where all the freaks would hang out late night, so
###248 it was fun.
###251 And then, Brian--
###252 I think he might have been like 11 or 12, and I remember
###257 one day we were skating my friend Jason's halfpipe.
###260 And these two kids just kind of walked up the driveway with
###263 their knee pads around their ankles.
###265 And it was Brian and his friend Joe.
###268 Brian just jumped right on the ramp and started doing
###271 everything.
###272 Like, we were pretty amazed.
###275 BRIAN ANDERSON: I probably met Donny when I was in like sixth
###278 grade or seventh grade or something like that.
###280 I was on Donny and Jason's team--
###282 Team 911.
###283 And they made me do all these different slappies in
###286 order to get on.
###287 They're like, all right, you've got to do backside to
###289 fakie or whatever and an Ollie Smith.
###292 And I did all these things, and they let me
###295 ride for Team 911.
###297 You get the little sticker that's the 911 emergency call
###300 that parents put on their home phone.
###301 And you put it right underneath your front truck.
###305 So I was psyched, dude.
###307 DONNY BARLEY: So there's a monument right here on the
###309 right hand side.
###310 We used to skate it all the time.
###312 And it's like a Vietnam memorial or something.
###315 See those little slants right there?
###318 We used to skate those all the time.
###320 The veterans would come by and be like, ready to murder us
###323 for skating a monument that represented these lives that
###328 have been lost fighting this war.
###331 I guess it is pretty disrespectful, but when you're
###334 young, you don't comprehend it.
###338 Brian's house is over here.
###342 This is it, yeah.
###343 That's the house right there, the gray one.
###345 Brian's room at one point was in the three
###347 windows on the top.
###349 I remember like ollieing down the stairs all the time when
###352 I'd come hang with Brian.
###355 So this little side street--
###357 we had like all these little ramps and boxes and little
###360 rails and stuff.
###362 And Brian would just to keep them underneath this weeping
###364 willow tree, and we'd just drag them out.
###368 But Brian's parents were like super, super
###371 mellow and super nice.
###373 I think Brian's parents were like maybe somewhat strict
###376 with his older siblings, but by the time Brain was a
###380 teenager, they were probably like, eh.
###385 BRIAN ANDERSON: The whole story is--
###387 I think my art teacher in high school was telling me that if
###392 you you do a portrait, you can check it in the mirror.
###396 And if it still looks proportionate, then you did
###400 all right or whatever.
###401 It'll help your art.
###402 And then so I realized that's a way to watch my favorite--
###406 because I'm regular footed, so I could watch all my favorite
###409 goofy footers skate regular footed.
###412 So you could put your favorite skater on TV.
###418 And then you chill out here with the mirror, and you can
###421 like see your favorite skater skate switch, on
###424 the opposite foot.
###424 So that's pretty cool.
###426 So this is the only ghetto-ass mirror I have.
###430 Look at it, it's regular footage of Keith Heath.
###432 This is so tight.
###433 
###439 Whoa, dude, so cool, man.
###443 DONNY BARLEY: And he's just always had this artistic
###447 approach, as opposed to athletic approach.
###449 And that's the difference between certain like amazing,
###454 talented skaters, you know?
###457 I feel like maybe I have an athletic edge, but Brian--
###463 he's always got his flow on, man.
###465 Even when he's just like getting warmed up and stuff.
###468 And when he was a kid, it was all about like loose shots and
###473 slapping curves and just cruising.
###476 Just his own world man--
###478 that's the way it's supposed to be.
###480 It's like, you can watch the videos and get things out of
###483 the skate videos, and a lot of the kids kind of mimic the
###485 skate videos.
###486 Brian--
###488 I feel like he was smart enough to take a little bit
###491 from all the videos that he liked and incorporate that
###494 into his own little melting pot or whatever, you know?
###498 
###513 CHAD MUSKA: Just doing it, man.
###514 Like, needed a change in life so here I am in
###517 New York City, Soho.
###519 Lights, camera, action.
###524 The early '90s--
###525 whenever that was-- or mid '90s, late '90s, something--
###528 somewhere in the '90s, it all began.
###531 And I started hanging around with Jamie
###533 Thomas, got on Toy Machine--
###536 then a little group kind of started to form.
###538 It was like Satva, me, Jamie, Panama Dan, and Ed Templeton,
###544 of course, and Donny Barley.
###546 And I think that was kind of like the main
###548 clique right there.
###550 DONNY BARLEY: All of a sudden, we're in our early '20s, and
###553 I'm in California, and I'm getting hooked up, and it's
###556 unbelievable.
###557 And then coming home and telling Brian about the
###559 success that I found and begging him to come out West
###564 to give it a shot--
###565 because if anybody could have made it, Brian could have done
###569 it all day, any day.
###572 CHAD MUSKA: Donny Barley was like, oh man, you guys gotta
###574 meet my homie Brian.
###575 He's crazy.
###575 He's like this crazy skater.
###577 He's insane.
###578 And we're all like, yeah, you always hear that.
###580 It's like everybody gots their homie from back in the day
###583 that's a crazy good skater, you know.
###585 So he's talking about him for a while, and then one day, oh,
###588 my friend Brian's in town, BA.
###593 ED TEMPLETON: We were on a filming trip during the
###595 "Welcome to Hell" days.
###596 I think Donny gets off the phone with somebody and says,
###600 hey, my friend back from Groton, Connecticut's in town.
###604 Is it cool if he comes skate with us today?
###607 DONNY BARLEY: I called him from Huntington Beach-- like,
###611 me and Ed and Muska and Jamie are going to come up to Frisco
###614 to film-- and you have to.
###616 You have to get to San Francisco.
###618 I will pick you up.
###619 I'll pay you back for your bus ticket--
###622 anything.
###623 I just begged.
###624 And I had already spent like six hours in the van telling
###628 these guys, when we get to Frisco, my friend Brian's
###630 going to come us.
###631 You guys are going to trip your balls off.
###633 This kid's the best skater ever, ever.
###635 It's so corny thinking back, but I think I did say
###638 something like, hey man, if you really want to make
###641 something now's the day.
###645 I just didn't know if this opportunity was going to come
###647 around again, you know.
###648 BRIAN ANDERSON: I wasn't concerned of fanning out on
###650 them or nothing.
###650 I didn't even know who Jamie Thomas was.
###652 Ed Templeton was like my idol when I was little.
###655 So Jamie Thomas was news to me, and Chad Muska--
###660 I didn't know who he was, either.
###661 And he wasn't "The Muska" yet.
###664 CHAD MUSKA: We went skating, and all of a sudden, I was
###665 like, damn, this dude's doing some crazy tricks.
###668 He's got like ill [INAUDIBLE].
###670 And he's messing around.
###671 He's just like rolling and just does like a 540 flip on
###674 flat ground or something like out of nowhere.
###675 And you're just like, what the hell.
###678 And then all of a sudden, he just started going around us
###681 in and just started busting and busting and busting and
###684 like crazy, crazy ass shit that like none of the pros
###687 were doing.
###687 And we're like this dude's not even sponsored.
###689 He hadn't even skated in two years, and all of a sudden, I
###692 was just so psyched on him.
###694 I remember being like, this guy's insane.
###696 He can do any trick he wants to do, anything.
###700 ED TEMPLETON: He starts killing it.
###701 Real sketchy, though.
###702 You could tell he doesn't skate all the time.
###705 But he ollied over the rail to boardslide--
###708 and it's in the video-- he boardslides down the long rail
###711 and comes off.
###712 And he's just flapping all over the place
###714 when he does it.
###715 And I think at that moment, we were just all like-- here's
###718 the whole Toy Machine team.
###719 We're supposed to be these dudes who slaughter stuff.
###722 Everyone gets to these rails, and no one's feeling anything,
###724 and we're all being wusses.
###725 And then this dude from Connecticut just
###728 manhandles this rail.
###729 DONNY BARLEY: I think he did it first try, or he slid half
###732 of it first try.
###734 And they were just like, what the fuck.
###736 Chad's like, Danny, go get the camera!
###739 And Jamie's running to the van and going up to Brian like,
###742 hey Brian, can you do this again?
###744 BRIAN ANDERSON: I didn't know that it was
###745 OK to refilm something.
###749 Like, I would land it and be like, ah, I landed it.
###753 I didn't know that it probably looked kind of gross and I
###755 should do a smoother one.
###756 
###768 Muska got hurt that day we skated in San Francisco.
###770 He tried to tailslide the [INAUDIBLE] ledge.
###772 
###774 I don't know if it ever came out, but he
###776 slammed really hard.
###779 He was in the van, I remember, after that.
###780 He was like, I just want to fucking smoke this bowl.
###784 And I was like, whoa, this dude's bumming.
###788 I passed the lighter through the window to
###790 Chad, like, here dude.
###792 I know you need to get stoned right now.
###793 You're so hurt.
###794 DONNY BARLEY: Right when Chad and Brian connected, I knew
###797 that that was half the battle.
###800 And then it was just a matter of convincing Ed and Jamie to
###804 put them on.
###806 CHAD MUSKA: It took everybody else a minute.
###807 Everybody was kind of like, I don't know, I don't know.
###809 And me and Donny were like, yeah.
###811 And I remember Ed was like, oh my god, this guy's dope.
###813 I think Ed liked him because he was tall and lanky, kind of
###815 like Ed was.
###816 So Ed was like, oh, I like this guy.
###820 ED TEMPLETON: I think all of us--
###821 especially me and Muska, because Muska's there-- and
###824 we're all like, holy crap, this guy's amazing.
###826 Let's put him on the team.
###827 And Jamie was just like, no way.
###829 What're you guys thinking?
###830 I don't know what Jamie will say to this, but at the time,
###833 he was not for it.
###834 Obviously, we're not just going to throw a guy on right
###837 there on the spot.
###838 So we told him, hey, we're really interested
###842 in you a real way.
###843 Do you have any footage?
###844 BRIAN ANDERSON: Those guys said, make me
###846 a sponsor me tape.
###846 So I skated around in Sac and got some cool
###849 stuff with Mike Rafter.
###851 And then we went to SF one day, I was like, I want to
###854 front side blunt side Hubba Hideout.
###855 I think I can do it.
###858 And I did it.
###859 So we put that in sponsor me tape.
###862 I shaved--
###862 bicced-- my head.
###864 So Jamie and Ed, once they saw the front side blunt side with
###867 the bicced head, they were like, oh, this dude looks like
###869 he just got out of fucking jail.
###872 Cool.
###873 ED TEMPLETON: And we were just blown away that we were
###875 getting a sponsor me video from a dude--
###877 Donny's bro from Connecticut--
###878 and he just bicced his head and front-blunts Hubba
###881 Hideout, which was just completely ludicrous.
###883 And I mean it was like, chill-giving, almost.
###886 The team watch and they're like, holy fuck.
###888 And that just submitted him on.
###889 I think Jamie was instantly, definitely on.
###893 Chad and I were already like, we love the guy.
###894 And I think everybody else on the team was just like, yeah,
###896 no-brainer.
###898 Front-blunt Hubba Hideout like a man.
###901 Yeah, I put him on.
###903 That was definitely the one push-over thing that he did,
###907 and he just looks so bad-ass doing it.
###910 MALE SPEAKER 1: In the Toy Machine video when he shrinks
###911 hubba with that look.
###912 I'm like, who the hell is this dude?
###915 Like 6 foot fucking 9.
###918 MALE SPEAKER 2: He took hubba down a foot or two with those
###919 fucking eyes.
###922 PATRICK O'DELL: He had a shaved head.
###923 MALE SPEAKER 2: Yeah, and just looking so beast
###924 rolling up to it.
###925 MALE SPEAKER 1: Comes around and he just stares right at it
###929 and he's just like oh, it got scared and was all [INAUDIBLE]
###932 and shrank a little.
###933 Brother's going to fuck me up.
###935 
###937 DONNY BARLEY: Brian Anderson--
###939 he's from Connecticut.
###940 We grew up skateboarding together.
###942 He's the best.
###944 CHAD MUSKA: All of a sudden, he had a part in a video and
###946 he went literally overnight from being like nobody, to
###950 giving up skateboarding, to coming in on a random visit--
###955 he became sponsored and started off to his career
###958 pretty much like that, unexpectedly.
###961 So I think that was really cool to see that all go down.
###966 BRIAN ANDERSON: Jamie Thomas and Templeton called me, and
###969 they're like, all right well, we're going to
###970 make this video soon.
###972 We want you to fly to San Diego and work on it.
###974 So I said OK, great.
###975 I think that was the first time I
###977 ever flew on an airplane.
###978 And I was taking off in [INAUDIBLE]
###980 like, whoa my head.
###981 This feels crazy.
###983 And I landed in San Diego.
###985 Jamie picked me up in his Honda Passport, and he said,
###988 this is Elissa Steamer.
###990 ELISSA STEAMER: I think I remember that day, too.
###993 BRIAN ANDERSON: I didn't know that you were going to be on
###995 Toy Machine, and I didn't know much about it either.
###997 And I didn't know anything about you.
###999 ELISSA STEAMER: I think I had seen your footage it in the
###1001 computer, maybe.
###1002 BRIAN ANDERSON: OK.
###1003 And then we just stayed at Jamie's house in Pacific Beach
###1006 and went out filming.
###1009 ELISSA STEAMER: I have this bad reaction when somebody
###1011 wins a trick, I'll scream, right.
###1013 And I'll always happen to be around the
###1015 camera for some reason.
###1016 And I remember that kinker--
###1018 BRIAN ANDERSON: It was my last trick and you went, whoa.
###1020 ELISSA STEAMER: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
###1022 PATRICK O'DELL: You know, it's funny--
###1022 I always thought that was a kid yelling.
###1024 ELISSA STEAMER: That was me.
###1025 I was a little kid.
###1026 Not really.
###1028 20-year-old.
###1031 BRIAN ANDERSON: It was awesome because I was psyched to just
###1032 be skating with people that ripped
###1034 constantly, all day long.
###1036 CHAD MUSKA: I remember the process for filming for
###1037 "Welcome To Hell." It was a crazy process, man.
###1040 So every once in a while, I got to stay on Jamie's couch.
###1042 And that was a privilege and a curse at the
###1044 same time, I guess.
###1045 Because I'd wake up at like 6:00 in the morning to Jamie
###1049 blasting Slayer and getting a pan and a tin and banging them
###1053 to my head and wake up with this dick on my shoulder or
###1057 something like that, crazy-like.
###1058 Jamie was crazy, man.
###1059 I woke up to a lot of crazy shit at Jamie's house.
###1062 Jamie had an agenda all the time.
###1064 He was like, OK, we're going to wake up today, and I got
###1067 this new angle I'm thinking about filming of you on the
###1069 handrail, and you're going to bust it today.
###1071 BRIAN ANDERSON: In my part there's a line.
###1072 Jamie's like, you should half-cab up this curb, and
###1074 then-- but he didn't command me.
###1076 He's like, Brian, maybe think about--
###1078 but it's helpful.
###1079 I like that about Jamie.
###1081 CHAD MUSKA: Brian started filming the illest video part
###1083 that was competing with all of our parts.
###1085 And we're like, oh shit, this dude's kiling it.
###1087 We have to step up our game to keep up
###1089 with his part, I remember.
###1090 ED TEMPLETON: For sure when that name came on the screen,
###1094 the collective skate audience must have been like, Brian
###1097 Anderson, what?
###1099 But then he just proceeded to slaughter everything and skate
###1104 super big hubbas and have this kind of groove.
###1107 You can see it in his lines.
###1109 He does a trick and does a couple swerves.
###1113 He's just got this jazz to the way he skated in that video.
###1115 And all of us were just super-psyched on it.
###1120 CHAD MUSKA: And it was like the video's coming out, we've
###1122 got to finish it.
###1124 And we worked it so hard in the video--
###1126 at the premiere it kind of all just fell apart that night.
###1130 DONNY BARLEY: Sure enough, Jamie tried his ass off, but
###1133 for some reason the computer crashed.
###1135 CHAD MUSKA: And it was, this was the reason, and that was a
###1137 reason, and people were drinking, and I was drinking,
###1141 and the kids were upset.
###1146 The kids wanted the videos so there's a lot of crazy energy
###1150 that all came out in one night.
###1153 I quit the team.
###1154 They kind of put me back on.
###1155 And then I quit again.
###1156 And then they kicked me off and it was like this whole
###1159 thing, and it just was time for me to move on.
###1164 DONNY BARLEY: The video was supposed to be--
###1166 Chad, I think, was supposed to have the last part.
###1168 Once Chad was gone, I think we went back in rearranged it.
###1172 And so we hit the road.
###1174 And we brought the video with us.
###1176 And every demo we'd show up and get out of the van and try
###1180 to rip as hard as we could for the kids.
###1182 Usually, we'd end up back in the skate shop.
###1185 The kids would watch the video and it was really, really nice
###1190 to see the reception of the video.
###1192 It was so positive.
###1193 Kids would watch it and just walk out of the skate shop
###1196 speechless.
###1197 BRIAN ANDERSON: I didn't know how gnarly people were going
###1199 to look at "Welcome to Hell." And at that time in
###1202 skateboarding--
###1204 obviously after amazing, amazing Plan B
###1206 videos, and all that--
###1207 I feel like maybe there wasn't anything huge besides
###1211 "Indecent Exposure" or something.
###1212 So I think Jamie blew lot of kids' minds with "Welcome to
###1216 Hell."
###1218 ELISSA STEAMER: I had no idea what I was
###1219 getting myself into.
###1220 You know what I mean?
###1221 I had no idea it was going to be so heavy of a video.
###1223 
###1226 Because of the Toy Machine video--
###1227 I had never even seen a Toy Machine video before.
###1230 BRIAN ANDERSON: After that video came out, because people
###1232 didn't know who I was, I went on this tour and I had an easy
###1235 time doing demos.
###1236 Because they were watching Jamie and Ed and Maldonado and
###1241 Satva, so I would just kind of skate around, and that
###1245 introduced me to doing demos.
###1247 Because otherwise, I probably would have been
###1248 like, uh, this is weird.
###1250 ED TEMPLETON: The rad times about that era for me was just
###1254 tour, as a general.
###1255 I was just, like some of the funnest tours ever.
###1257 For me, shooting photos I guess is what I'm saying.
###1259 Like I was documenting this whole like--
###1263 just those guys, just the team.
###1265 I guess you can kind of equate it to some people have this
###1269 like, I was the high school captain of the football team
###1272 and the king of the prom, or something.
###1274 And they live their whole life looking back on those one
###1277 achievements in high school.
###1278 It's like, for me, that era is one of those things I look
###1282 back on, and just be like, man, those were
###1283 the best times ever.
###1284 Those are the times of our lives.
###1285 That was right before the era where it was real important to
###1288 be filming all the time.
###1289 So demos and fun were the main focus, not let's go use every
###1296 spare minute at a spot and trying to get footage.
###1298 It was literally like, let's go buy a raft and go rafting
###1305 for the hell of it.
###1305 Or eat good food, skate spots when you feel like it, show up
###1310 at the demo and kill it, that kind of stuff.
###1312 BRIAN ANDERSON: Skating for Ed was great.
###1314 Ed had never messed with you.
###1315 We could smoke all the weed we wanted and drink beer, and
###1318 that was fine.
###1319 because he knew we were all down to skate.
###1320 And we all would wake up and go do the best demo we could.
###1324 ELISSA STEAMER: Like friends are friends, right?
###1326 But it's almost like you form a different special bond with
###1330 like a teammate or somebody that you travel with
###1332 all the time for--
###1334 you know?
###1334 BRIAN ANDERSON: When we were partying and stuff, I was kind
###1337 of her personal bodyguard.
###1338 ELISSA STEAMER: Yeah.
###1340 Where were we before we came here, Donny?
###1343 I've still got to make a book of people's stories of
###1345 dragging or something.
###1347 But, yeah, he's protected me a lot.
###1349 PATRICK O'DELL: Tell me about that.
###1350 BRIAN ANDERSON: Love protecting her.
###1352 ELISSA STEAMER: Oh, just like get in between some angry
###1356 person and me, or carry me home, or find me on the side
###1362 of the road, or something.
###1364 BRIAN ANDERSON: Sometimes somebody would be saying some
###1365 inappropriate things.
###1366 ELISSA STEAMER: Inappropriate, that's the word.
###1367 BRIAN ANDERSON: Just like, come on.
###1369 And I'm not a fighter but I certainly
###1372 have a lot of sisters.
###1374 I feel this need to protect her.
###1378 ED TEMPLETON: This was just funny because Elissa had
###1381 dranken way too much the night before and was just completely
###1385 fucked in the morning.
###1386 She had already barfed there on the curb,
###1388 right where she's sitting.
###1389 Mike had some porn mag, and it was just funny.
###1393 I wanted to kind of get a shot of like the stuff Alissa has
###1395 to put up with, driving on tour with a bunch of guys.
###1398 Constant porn mags everywhere, and girls walking by the van
###1403 definitely get commented on in pretty rude ways, and
###1407 obviously Elissa just like laughs at all that stuff and
###1409 thinks it's funny.
###1411 ELISSA STEAMER: It really wasn't difficult.
###1412 It was kind of like the funnest thing ever.
###1414 Because, I mean, I had to skate all the time in order to
###1419 get into the position to go on tour, so therefore all I hung
###1422 out with was guys all day, every day.
###1424 So it was just like the same thing.
###1427 It was just like switching from one pack of wolves to
###1430 another pack of wolves.
###1433 PATRICK O'DELL: Yeah.
###1434 
###1445 BRAD STABA: Brian's great, man.
###1446 I had to get him to come out here.
###1447 Like, he usually denies me for most everything.
###1450 PATRICK O'DELL: When we were filming this, he'd be like,
###1452 ah, I'm super busy, but OK, let's just
###1453 try to make it work.
###1454 Then I'd be like, so what do you have to do that you're so
###1457 busy today?
###1458 Oh, I gotta go to the grocery store.
###1460 And it was like really [INAUDIBLE] stuff.
###1462 BRAD STABA: Stuff that he could just do in two seconds.
###1464 And you know he lives right next to the
###1465 grocery store, right?
###1467 PATRICK O'DELL: Yeah, that's what he'd do.
###1468 He's right next to the Safeway.
###1472 BRAD STABA: Dude, he could hop his back fence, and literally
###1475 he's in the Safeway.
###1476 So he doesn't use the going to the grocery store one on me
###1480 because I'll call him out in a second.
###1481 But yeah, he'll whip out some fucked up excuses, man.
###1487 Pull.
###1488 
###1490 I met Brian in 1997.
###1495 And then we went on this Europe trip.
###1498 It was Donny Barley, me, Brian, and Josh Spiegel.
###1502 DONNY BARLEY: Brian and Brad totally were like
###1505 instant best friends.
###1507 And I think they've just been homies ever since.
###1510 Just weird personalities that kind of click
###1515 for whatever reason.
###1516 
###1520 PATRICK O'DELL: So then "Jump Off A Building"
###1521 was the next video?
###1522 BRIAN ANDERSON: Oh, that's right, yeah, "Jump Off A
###1523 Building."
###1524 PATRICK O'DELL: Is Donny Barley in that, or had he
###1525 already left?
###1526 BRIAN ANDERSON: Nope, Donny left.
###1528 He just didn't jive with Ed for a little bit there.
###1531 ED TEMPLETON: "Jump Off A Building" era was kind of like
###1533 a great era but also a strange one at the same time.
###1536 Jamie had departed to do Zero on his own.
###1540 Up until that point, Jamie's took Toy Machine from--
###1544 obviously "Welcome to Hell" and that whole era was a lot
###1547 of Jamie influence.
###1549 Me being lazy and having someone who was super eager to
###1554 make the team rad and do all this-- make the video awesome.
###1557 I was just like, that's great--
###1558 do that.
###1559 When he left it was like, oh, it's back to me.
###1561 I've got to do this up to the same standard
###1563 that we just set.
###1564 So without Jamie, it was kind of like
###1566 independent-contractor style.
###1568 I expected the team to go out and film their own stuff.
###1571 Like go out and film-- give me the footage.
###1574 That was that era.
###1576 BRIAN ANDERSON: Skating was just so easy to go film then.
###1579 I was going out with Brad and Moreford every day.
###1581 And Brad would film me.
###1582 Brad filmed tons of my tricks in that video.
###1585 BRAD STABA: Dude, he did this gnarly tailslide down this
###1587 hubba ledge.
###1588 I videod it.
###1591 That stood out only because I was behind the lens.
###1593 I really only pay attention to stuff that involves myself.
###1598 ED TEMPLETON: At one point, the pressure starts coming.
###1600 It's like, hey, we want you to do this and that.
###1602 We want you get a photo for an ad, or there's another video
###1605 we're working on.
###1606 Let's film.
###1606 And if your main focus is just like, I could just as soon be
###1609 a chef than skateboard, then obviously you're not going to
###1612 give your sponsor exactly what he wants.
###1613 I remember like just philosophizing with him,
###1615 saying something like, you can do all that stuff.
###1618 You can still become a chef if you want.
###1620 But you have this talent at skateboarding.
###1622 And you can just do this for a couple of years and
###1624 potentially make a lot of money.
###1626 And I feel like he just switched in his head.
###1630 He just decided, yeah, I'm just going to slaughter
###1632 skateboarding, and easily did it.
###1634 He just won the Moonster contests when he wanted to,
###1638 and the world championship--
###1641 won it back-to-back, I think.
###1643 And started just killing contests and making big
###1647 contest money and pretty much put himself on the map just by
###1651 deciding to.
###1652 PATRICK O'DELL: How'd you find out that you were going to be
###1653 Skater of the Year?
###1655 BRIAN ANDERSON: Well, Gabe said he wanted to work on an
###1656 article with me to get me shooting photos for it.
###1660 And then towards the end of the year, I kind of realized
###1662 what those photos were probably for.
###1664 I think around November it was like--
###1667 somebody told me, or--
###1670 oh, and then I had to shoot the cover.
###1671 So I knew.
###1673 The cover was me in a chair with like a cigar and a fake
###1678 Toy Machine diamond medallion.
###1680 There's like wheels everywhere and trucks.
###1682 It was supposed to look like a No Limit
###1683 album cover, basically.
###1685 BRAD STABA: When he got Skater of the Year,
###1686 it was pretty cool.
###1687 PATRICK O'DELL: I remember I went to that party.
###1689 I remember it was like Donny and Maldonado
###1692 and all those people.
###1693 BRAD STABA: Yeah.
###1694 Alls I remember is I saw him for a while.
###1696 We hung out, and then I guess I had his check.
###1701 You know they give those guys the big checks, you know?
###1703 So I was in charge of his check and somebody
###1704 responsible, like Ed or somebody, was in charge of the
###1707 trophy, I think.
###1709 Brian was just in charge of blacking out.
###1711 BRIAN ANDERSON: During Skater of the Year--
###1712 I'm shooting photos for Skater of the Year--
###1715 Monty Carol calls me and is like, hey dude, I heard you're
###1717 [INAUDIBLE] at Toy Machine.
###1718 I just wanted you to know, we could help you out
###1719 over here at Girl.
###1721 I'm like, wow man, that's so nice.
###1724 I was blown away.
###1725 And I said, no man, I'm not doing it.
###1729 So I didn't do it, obviously, and I stayed.
###1731 But I was really sick of Toy Machine.
###1732 And I knew dudes were over it.
###1734 We went on a tour, and Maldonado was bummed, Kerry
###1737 was bummed on Ed.
###1738 At the end of that, I called Rick and I was like, hey dude,
###1742 I was wondering if that the thing that Mike said--
###1744 that offer--
###1745 is still there, because I'm kind of over this thing.
###1747 And Rick was very concerned.
###1748 He said, what about Ed Templeton, dude?
###1751 I don't want to be that guy that takes you from Ed.
###1754 And I was like, well dude, I'll deal with Ed.
###1758 I care about him--
###1759 I love him, but this is my progression in life.
###1764 ED TEMPLETON: Kerry left, Bam left, Mike left, Elissa left,
###1769 so Brian's call was I'm going to quit, because we have to
###1775 rebuild Toy Machine from where we are.
###1778 And I don't want to do that.
###1782 But what am I going to do?
###1784 I based all my relationships with the riders on the team on
###1788 friendship.
###1789 So none of these quittings was like me flipping out or being
###1791 pissed at anybody.
###1792 It was always just like OK, are you sure?
###1794 OK, go for it, you know, what can I do?
###1796 It was sad, for sure.
###1798 I was fully bumming.
###1799 I've had these periods where people have quit, and it
###1802 leaves me no choice but to try to get in this rebuild mode
###1805 and try to be optimistic.
###1806 But I can't lie when I say there's like tearful nights
###1811 when that stuff happens and self-doubt
###1816 comes into the picture.
###1817 Am I blowing it somehow?
###1819 Am I not not making Toy Machine not what it can be?
###1821 Is Girl that much better?
###1824 How do we run stuff that makes everyone want to quit?
###1827 I don't know, I just start freaking out.
###1830 I feel good about it on the fact that I base it on
###1833 friendship and that I care about Brian's career more than
###1837 I care about my Toy Machine business.
###1840 So if he's going to be happy, then I'm happy.
###1842 Brian went on to Girl and continued his destruction,
###1847 basically, without Toy Machine.
###1850 
###1852 BRIAN ANDERSON: Me and Jake Phelps found this on the river
###1855 in China in Beijing, I think?
###1858 Wait, is Beijing the one where they cut down all the forest
###1862 and now it's really windy there?
###1864 Right?
###1865 JERRY HSU: I don't know.
###1865 BRIAN ANDERSON: What's the other major city there?
###1867 JERRY HSU: Shanghai.
###1868 BRIAN ANDERSON: Shanghai.
###1870 What's the one with the river going through it?
###1872 JERRY HSU: Shanghai's got the spots.
###1874 PATRICK O'DELL: Jerry knows everything about China.
###1877 JERRY HSU: Anything else you want to know about China, you
###1879 could just ask me.
###1881 BRIAN ANDERSON: This is where I go grab my boards.
###1882 
###1887 This is the first in the quiver.
###1889 I'm really proud of my quiver, lately.
###1892 We screwed my shoes in here.
###1896 And I thought I was going to be able to boardslide a
###1898 handrail with them on.
###1899 Just rollerskate up--
###1903 I'm regular footed, so I thought I could front board
###1905 [INAUDIBLE] handrail.
###1906 What I did was I was actually standing on the handrail, and
###1909 I had Frank [INAUDIBLE]
###1910 he held me up and I balanced on the rail, and then he ran
###1913 away and I jumped off the handrail in the air and he
###1915 took the picture.
###1916 It was pretty scary, actually.
###1919 This is one board right now.
###1921 This is a tapered tail.
###1922 It's got a really good tail for 360 flips.
###1925 So I call this my three-flip board.
###1929 I'll ride my own pro board.
###1931 Sometimes I put some stickers kind of close to my name or
###1933 almost over it.
###1935 I've done that before.
###1936 And then there are times when like--
###1938 what the hell, man, I should ride my board, you know?
###1942 This board totally sucks to skate but I
###1945 put it together recently.
###1946 It's a Steve Alba, obviously.
###1949 I spent a lot of time on the sticker job on the top.
###1953 Probably some serious Buddha involved with that one.
###1958 Yeah, Efil4zaggin, man--
###1960 I forgot all about Efil4zaggin.
###1963 PATRICK O'DELL: What's Efil4zaggin?
###1964 BRIAN ANDERSON: I think it's the NWA record.
###1966 It's Niggaz4Life backwards.
###1968 This is my real Steve Olsen.
###1970 And that's it.
###1972 This one's really fun.
###1972 So my quiver is up to--
###1975 these don't count--
###1976 
###1980 seven.
###1981 That's pretty cool.
###1982 And I skate them all, like all week long.
###1984 That's it.
###1986 PATRICK O'DELL: What skaters are out now or that you know
###1988 that really inspire you?
###1990 BRIAN ANDERSON: Well, my favorite skater is probably
###1991 Nick Trapasso.
###1992 And oh, you know my all-time favorite
###1994 skater ever is Ben Schroeder.
###1996 He inspired me.
###1998 Even the guys in my neighborhood I grew up with
###2000 were always like man, Schroeder-- that guy's just
###2003 kind of a beast.
###2005 And I think as I got older I got taller.
###2008 So when I actually see him live now, I'm
###2009 like whoa, I get it.
###2011 That's why I understand what he does, because it's like
###2014 he's bigger than me, for sure.
###2016 But he's pretty oafy, and it's like the best.
###2018 I love it.
###2021 PATRICK O'DELL: What about--
###2022 you were telling Jake that you didn't read the magazines.
###2024 BRIAN ANDERSON: Oh, yeah, just a long time ago.
###2026 It was like--
###2027 well, I'll be 33 this summer--
###2029 so it must have been three years ago or something.
###2034 I don't remember the situation.
###2037 He asked me something and I was like, dude, I'm
###2039 30 years old, man.
###2041 I don't read the mags.
###2043 And he just loved that for some reason.
###2047 I wasn't trying to be funny.
###2049 I was like, I don't know dude, I'm trying to not look at
###2051 those things.
###2052 JAKE PHELPS: You had that same shirt in
###2053 the Jerry Hsu episode.
###2055 PATRICK O'DELL: Yeah.
###2056 I wear it a lot.
###2057 
###2060 You got anything to say about Brian?
###2062 Can you--
###2064 JAKE PHELPS: Encapsulate it?
###2065 PATRICK O'DELL: Yeah.
###2067 JAKE PHELPS: He's just a good, solid boarder.
###2069 He's easy on the eyes.
###2071 I hate to say it, but a lot of people try wicked hard and
###2074 they end up missing it.
###2076 But Brian--
###2077 he comes in the park-- he does a full line
###2079 when he comes in here.
###2082 BRIAN ANDERSON: OK.
###2082 JAKE PHELPS: What are you going to make?
###2084 Is it possible?
###2084 BRIAN ANDERSON: Change it up.
###2085 JAKE PHELPS: Spice it up a little bit?
###2087 BRIAN ANDERSON: Switch, slappy, half-gallon--
###2090 JAKE PHELPS: Oh, this is sick.
###2091 This is my favorite line.
###2092 This switch slappie on that wall of doom is gnarly.
###2094 Watch this.
###2095 Go get them, B. Yeah!
###2112 
###2116 Are you okay?
###2117 BRIAN ANDERSON: Shit, I'm going slow.
###2120 JAKE PHELPS: Black socks and shit, that's hard.
###2124 Back tail-- oh, here it comes.
###2126 15 seconds, world cup.
###2129 Yes, and that's time.
###2130 Did you see it?
###2132 15 seconds, Daniel and Bostic where's my wine?
###2135 Fucking bitch.
###2137 
###2141 PATRICK O'DELL: Is that why you gave him
###2142 Skater of the Year?
###2142 JAKE PHELPS: Why I gave him Skater of the Year?
###2143 PATRICK O'DELL: Or why he won Skater of the Year?
###2145 JAKE PHELPS: Well, he was Skater of the Year because
###2149 he's just a solid dude.
###2150 He repps the mag and people that are good.
###2155 I mean, it's a pretty illustrious crew.
###2159 Some people win, some people don't.
###2160 Chad Muska never got it, fuck.
###2162 
###2164 BRIAN ANDERSON: It's going to be mad rewarding, son.
###2166 
###2173 I was watching like a baseball game, and you see the coach
###2176 out there, and he's like 65 years old.
###2178 I kind of realized he's coaching because he loves
###2181 baseball, obviously.
###2183 So that made me feel better about the future of
###2185 skateboarding.
###2185 Like well, it wouldn't be strange if I stayed and worked
###2190 in skateboarding, I guess, because it's something I
###2192 really like.
###2194 You know, like how somebody would like baseball or
###2196 basketball.
###2198 Because sometimes you think like, dude, this
###2200 skateboarding thing.
###2201 You see some bozos skating down the street and
###2202 you're like, ugh.
###2204 But for us it's different.
###2206 We really, really like it.
###2207 So fuck--
###2208 I mean, why not?
###2209 I should be proud of that and enjoy that, so--
###2212 it was kind of like something I just told myself, or had a
###2215 realization that everything's okay.
###2218 JAKE PHELPS: Ta-da!
###2221 BRIAN ANDERSON: I like that switch grip.
###2221 It was the one I wanted to do.
###2223 
###2225 Thanks, Pat.
###2225 It was fun.
###2226 PATRICK O'DELL: Thank you, Brian.
###2227
