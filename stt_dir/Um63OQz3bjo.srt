1
0:0:0,21 --> 0:0:1,609
What is Bitcoin?


2
0:0:1,609 --> 0:0:2,902
Bitcoin is the first


3
0:0:2,902 --> 0:0:5,0
decentralized digital currency.


4
0:0:5,0 --> 0:0:6,138
Bitcoins are digital coins


5
0:0:6,138 --> 0:0:7,951
you can send
through the Internet.


6
0:0:7,951 --> 0:0:9,333
Compared to other
alternatives,


7
0:0:9,333 --> 0:0:11,492
Bitcoins have a number
of advantages.


8
0:0:11,492 --> 0:0:12,545
Bitcoins are transferred


9
0:0:12,545 --> 0:0:13,312
directly from person


10
0:0:13,312 --> 0:0:13,992
to person


11
0:0:13,992 --> 0:0:14,759
via the net


12
0:0:14,759 --> 0:0:15,798
without going
through a bank


13
0:0:15,798 --> 0:0:17,145
or clearinghouse.


14
0:0:17,145 --> 0:0:18,831
This means that the fees
are much lower,


15
0:0:18,831 --> 0:0:20,339
you can use them
in every country,


16
0:0:20,339 --> 0:0:21,792
your account cannot
be frozen


17
0:0:21,792 --> 0:0:22,933
and there are no
prerequisites


18
0:0:22,933 --> 0:0:25,952
or arbitrary limits.


19
0:0:25,952 --> 0:0:27,795
Let's look at how it works!


20
0:0:27,795 --> 0:0:29,935
Bitcoins are generated
all over the Internet


21
0:0:29,935 --> 0:0:31,513
by anybody running
a free application


22
0:0:31,513 --> 0:0:33,445
called a Bitcoin miner.


23
0:0:33,445 --> 0:0:35,239
Mining requires a certain
amount of work


24
0:0:35,239 --> 0:0:36,968
for each block of coins.


25
0:0:36,968 --> 0:0:38,273
This amount is
automatically adjusted


26
0:0:38,273 --> 0:0:39,273
 by the network


27
0:0:39,273 --> 0:0:40,74
such that Bitcoins
are always created


28
0:0:40,74 --> 0:0:44,146
at a predictable
and limited rate.


29
0:0:44,146 --> 0:0:46,503
Your Bitcoins are stored
in your digital wallet


30
0:0:46,503 --> 0:0:49,222
which might look familiar
if you use online banking.


31
0:0:49,222 --> 0:0:50,456
When you transfer Bitcoins,


32
0:0:50,456 --> 0:0:52,55
an electronic signature
is added.


33
0:0:52,55 --> 0:0:53,446
After a few minutes


34
0:0:53,446 --> 0:0:55,566
the transaction is
verified by a miner


35
0:0:55,566 --> 0:0:57,72
and permanently and
anonymously stored


36
0:0:57,72 --> 0:0:58,301
in the network.


37
0:0:58,301 --> 0:1:0,704
The Bitcoin software is
completely open source


38
0:1:0,704 --> 0:1:2,924
and anybody can
review the code.


39
0:1:2,924 --> 0:1:4,564
Bitcoin is
changing finance


40
0:1:4,564 --> 0:1:6,818
the same way the web
changed publishing.


41
0:1:6,818 --> 0:1:8,15
When everyone
has access


42
0:1:8,15 --> 0:1:9,146
to a global market,


43
0:1:9,146 --> 0:1:11,624
great ideas flourish.


44
0:1:11,624 --> 0:1:13,206
Let's look at
some examples


45
0:1:13,206 --> 0:1:15,201
of how Bitcoins are
already used today:


46
0:1:15,201 --> 0:1:16,913
You can purchase
video games,


47
0:1:16,913 --> 0:1:17,811
gifts,


48
0:1:17,811 --> 0:1:18,685
books,


49
0:1:18,685 --> 0:1:19,623
servers


50
0:1:19,623 --> 0:1:21,498
and alpaca socks.


51
0:1:21,498 --> 0:1:23,208
Several currency exchanges exist


52
0:1:23,208 --> 0:1:24,427
where you can trade
your Bitcoins


53
0:1:24,427 --> 0:1:24,997
for dollars,


54
0:1:24,997 --> 0:1:25,49
euros


55
0:1:25,49 --> 0:1:26,295
and more.


56
0:1:26,295 --> 0:1:27,41
Bitcoins are
a great way


57
0:1:27,41 --> 0:1:29,5
for small businesses
and freelancers


58
0:1:29,5 --> 0:1:30,388
to get noticed.


59
0:1:30,388 --> 0:1:32,378
It doesn't cost anything to
start accepting them,


60
0:1:32,378 --> 0:1:33,745
there are no chargebacks or fees


61
0:1:33,745 --> 0:1:35,42
and you'll get
additional business


62
0:1:35,42 --> 0:1:36,985
from the Bitcoin economy.

0:1:36,985 --> 0:1:39,312
