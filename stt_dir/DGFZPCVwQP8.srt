0:1:6,566 --> 0:1:8,802
How long does it take
to make a taco?


3
0:1:8,802 --> 0:1:11,69
Two minutes. But it takes 20
to convince them


4
0:1:11,69 --> 0:1:15,241
I'm not Immigration to get
the cook up from the basement. Here.


5
0:1:15,241 --> 0:1:18,344
Call it.


6
0:1:18,344 --> 0:1:20,513
- Uhh, ex-con.
- No way.


7
0:1:20,513 --> 0:1:22,148
- What?
- Wannabe cop.


8
0:1:22,148 --> 0:1:24,238
Got "police academy reject"
written all over.


9
0:1:24,238 --> 0:1:26,886
Hey, pal!
Hey, buddy!


10
0:1:26,886 --> 0:1:30,59
- Try "dude".
- Hey, dude!


11
0:1:30,59 --> 0:1:35,228
- You did time in Chino, right?
- No, Lompoc.


12
0:1:35,228 --> 0:1:39,854
I told you. Ex-con. It's the only job
the poor bastards can get. Thank you.


13
0:1:39,854 --> 0:1:42,249
<i>13-A-6-7, you have a 4-59</i>


14
0:1:42,249 --> 0:1:47,807
<i>silent alarm at Centurion
Storage, Alvarado and Marathon. </i>


15
0:1:47,807 --> 0:1:49,476
A-6-7, roger.


16
0:1:49,476 --> 0:1:52,378
<i>13-A-6-7,
cancel that pre-alarm company. </i>


17
0:1:52,378 --> 0:1:55,849
<i>- Must've been a power glitch.
- Wanna take a peek anyway?</i>


18
0:1:55,849 --> 0:1:59,504
Why is it that on these nice
quiet nights you get so restless?


19
0:1:59,504 --> 0:2:3,656
I mean, this is a great opportunity
for us to connect, you know?


20
0:2:3,656 --> 0:2:8,761
We can open up with one another
and really kinda talk. You need a hug?


21
0:2:8,761 --> 0:2:20,44
Shut up.


22
0:2:20,44 --> 0:2:23,81
Uh, you called it.


23
0:2:23,81 --> 0:2:26,93
A-6-7, door open,
Centurion Storage,


24
0:2:26,93 --> 0:2:30,483
Alameda 22nd. Requesting backup.
- Roger, A-6-7.


25
0:2:30,483 --> 0:2:38,429
- Let's go.
- 3-1 en route.


26
0:2:38,429 --> 0:2:41,528
Hey, Charlie, you ever hear
that word, "stealth"?


27
0:2:41,528 --> 0:2:44,697
Shut up.


28
0:2:44,697 --> 0:2:49,469
At least they don't know we're here.
The element of surprise.


29
0:2:49,469 --> 0:2:51,371
- Ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready.


30
0:2:51,371 --> 0:3:11,991
- Go on.
- You're unbelievable.


31
0:3:11,991 --> 0:3:43,964
- Let's split up.
- Okay.


32
0:3:43,964 --> 0:3:45,91
<i>Hank! </i>


33
0:3:45,91 --> 0:3:51,799
A-6-7, shots fired!
Shots fired! Officer needs help!


34
0:3:51,799 --> 0:3:58,338
<i>Hank, taking fire, four to five
suspects on my side. </i>


35
0:3:58,338 --> 0:4:21,227
<i>Hank! </i>


36
0:4:21,227 --> 0:4:23,371
Come in!
Where you at?


37
0:4:23,371 --> 0:4:25,765
<i>I'm in the big room,
off the office.</i>


38
0:4:25,765 --> 0:4:31,862
<i>- Hank!
- I got you!</i>


39
0:4:31,862 --> 0:4:41,614
<i>- Hank!
- It's bulletproof! I'm comin' in!</i>


40
0:4:41,614 --> 0:4:44,584
Charlie! Your six!


41
0:4:44,584 --> 0:4:54,861
- What?
- Your six!


42
0:4:54,861 --> 0:4:59,743
A-6-7,
my partner's down!


43
0:4:59,743 --> 0:5:5,305
Request paramedics.
I have four suspects, armed!


44
0:5:5,305 --> 0:5:8,96
My partner has been hit!


45
0:5:8,96 --> 0:5:39,739
<i>All units, all units, all L.A. units.
Officer down. Officer down. </i>


46
0:5:39,739 --> 0:5:41,926
Impressive shooting,
Montgomery.


47
0:5:41,926 --> 0:5:47,18
You realize, though, you missed
the target in the middle.


48
0:5:47,18 --> 0:5:50,16
Who, the brother?
I wasn't shootin' at him.


49
0:5:50,16 --> 0:5:54,29
- You mind telling me why not?
- He don't look suspicious to me.


50
0:5:54,29 --> 0:5:58,958
Look at 'im. One lone brother,
surrounded by four white guys with guns?


51
0:5:58,958 --> 0:6:0,56
The man is terrified.


52
0:6:0,56 --> 0:6:2,628
What do you want him do?
Tap-dance?


53
0:6:2,628 --> 0:6:6,65
It's all right, brother.
Okay? I got you.


54
0:6:6,65 --> 0:6:9,102
Don't be afraid to call 911.


55
0:6:9,102 --> 0:6:12,939
I keeps it clean, when Herb
Montgomery's on the scene.


56
0:6:12,939 --> 0:6:27,153
What the problem is?


57
0:6:27,153 --> 0:6:29,989
On behalf of the citizens
of Los Angeles,


58
0:6:29,989 --> 0:6:36,896
I present to you
our nation's flag.


59
0:6:36,896 --> 0:6:39,398
McDuff.


60
0:6:39,398 --> 0:6:41,655
Sorry about Charlie, Hank.
He was a good man.


61
0:6:41,655 --> 0:6:43,836
I want in
on the investigation.


62
0:6:43,836 --> 0:6:45,75
Hank, I think it's best
if we let McDuff handle this


63
0:6:45,75 --> 0:6:48,702
in his own way.
It's a complicated situation.


64
0:6:48,702 --> 0:6:50,41
Wh-what's so complicated
about it?


65
0:6:50,41 --> 0:6:53,613
My partner's dead and I just want
the son of a bitch who pulled the trigger.


66
0:6:53,613 --> 0:6:56,582
There was over 800,000 dollars of
stolen computer chips in that storage


67
0:6:56,582 --> 0:6:58,217
and a police warrant
to seize it.


68
0:6:58,217 --> 0:6:59,942
The night before the raid,
somebody blew in there


69
0:6:59,942 --> 0:7:0,606
and cleared it out.


70
0:7:0,606 --> 0:7:2,902
Look, I don't care about
any goddamn computer chips.


71
0:7:2,902 --> 0:7:4,566
I just want the guy
who killed Charlie.


72
0:7:4,566 --> 0:7:8,122
You're a uniform, not a detective.
Stick to your job.


73
0:7:8,122 --> 0:7:8,834
Fine.


74
0:7:8,834 --> 0:7:10,56
You interfere with
an ongoing investigation,


75
0:7:10,56 --> 0:7:11,712
you won't have a job.
Am I clear?


76
0:7:11,712 --> 0:7:12,615
Yeah, fine.


77
0:7:12,615 --> 0:7:15,668
- Hank. They're gonna find 'im.
- Yeah.


78
0:7:15,668 --> 0:7:17,38
When chasing a suspect,


79
0:7:17,38 --> 0:7:19,36
the goal is simply
to maintain visual contact


80
0:7:19,36 --> 0:7:25,465
until a backup force of sufficient size
can arrive to assist in the arrest.


81
0:7:25,465 --> 0:7:26,612
Time!


82
0:7:26,612 --> 0:7:31,517
Nice job, Taylor.


83
0:7:31,517 --> 0:7:33,92
Did you say something,
Montgomery?


84
0:7:33,92 --> 0:7:39,192
Well, you said "Nice job, Taylor",
and I just said:


85
0:7:39,192 --> 0:7:43,83
- You think you can do it better?
- Let me think.


86
0:7:43,83 --> 0:7:46,341
Check me out.


87
0:7:46,341 --> 0:7:48,667
Hey, Taylor,
you think he ready?


88
0:7:48,667 --> 0:7:50,203
- I'll take this one.
- All yours.


89
0:7:50,203 --> 0:8:2,81
Show this boy how it's done.


90
0:8:2,81 --> 0:8:4,817
So you the suspect, man?
What you do?


91
0:8:4,817 --> 0:8:6,152
Doesn't matter.


92
0:8:6,152 --> 0:8:9,388
Oh, so, you could've robbed a bank,
mugged an old lady...


93
0:8:9,388 --> 0:8:11,39
said somethin'
about my mama?


94
0:8:11,39 --> 0:8:13,426
Just chase me,
smartmouth.


95
0:8:13,426 --> 0:9:12,952
Okay,
Mr. White Bank Robber.


96
0:9:12,952 --> 0:9:14,654
You're insane!


97
0:9:14,654 --> 0:9:23,95
And you're resisting arrest.


98
0:9:23,95 --> 0:9:27,567
Don't you run from me.
Don't you run from me.


99
0:9:27,567 --> 0:9:32,171
I'm insane? I'm insane when
it comes to old-lady muggers, huh?


100
0:9:32,171 --> 0:9:36,475
You like robbin' banks, huh?
You said somethin' about my mama?


101
0:9:36,475 --> 0:9:40,846
And I heard you
call me "boy".


102
0:9:40,846 --> 0:9:43,683
That's cowboy to you.


103
0:9:43,683 --> 0:9:51,424
Time!


104
0:9:51,424 --> 0:9:52,792
I see how this works.


105
0:9:52,792 --> 0:9:57,96
The system can't tolerate a black man
who master clear police skills.


106
0:9:57,96 --> 0:9:59,432
I'm the future law enforcement,
and it scares you


107
0:9:59,432 --> 0:10:1,267
cause you're gonna be
out of work, right?


108
0:10:1,267 --> 0:10:3,989
Look, I remember when the
NBA was all white.


109
0:10:3,989 --> 0:10:5,471
You know...


110
0:10:5,471 --> 0:10:8,674
That's a'it. That's a'it.
I'm fine, I'm cool.


111
0:10:8,674 --> 0:10:10,518
Cause y'all losin'
somebody good, yo.


112
0:10:10,518 --> 0:10:17,202
I'm a virtual one-man,
kung-fu SWAT team.


113
0:10:17,202 --> 0:10:27,609
That's a'it.
I got skills! You, bitches!


114
0:10:27,609 --> 0:10:28,809
Hank.


115
0:10:28,809 --> 0:10:32,963
- Don't have to be back up there so soon.
- No, I'm better off.


116
0:10:32,963 --> 0:11:19,597
- Want somebody to ride with you?
- No. It's okay.


117
0:11:19,597 --> 0:11:21,28
Need some help?


118
0:11:21,28 --> 0:11:25,951
You askin' me if I need some help,
or... if I'm stealin' this car?


119
0:11:25,951 --> 0:11:27,353
Okay, fine.


120
0:11:27,353 --> 0:11:30,89
Are you stealin' this car?


121
0:11:30,89 --> 0:11:33,292
Does it look like
I'm stealin' this damn car?


122
0:11:33,292 --> 0:11:36,502
- Little bit.
- Why? Because I'm black?


123
0:11:36,502 --> 0:11:38,33
White man has his hand
in the car,


124
0:11:38,33 --> 0:11:40,881
you probably give him
a good samaritan award, huh?


125
0:11:40,881 --> 0:11:43,649
Figure he's just goin' around
turn off people's lights.


126
0:11:43,649 --> 0:11:46,766
Yeah. All right, could I see
your license and registration, please?


127
0:11:46,766 --> 0:11:51,453
I ain't showin' you
a damn thing, you Nazi.


128
0:11:51,453 --> 0:11:53,446
- Excuse me?
- Hey, man!


129
0:11:53,446 --> 0:11:55,74
This here? This is my car.


130
0:11:55,74 --> 0:11:58,413
Hey, now, I ain't done
nothing wrong.


131
0:11:58,413 --> 0:11:59,785
Now, the way I see it,


132
0:11:59,785 --> 0:12:2,755
- you owe me an apology.
- What did you just call me?


133
0:12:2,755 --> 0:12:6,536
You ain't listening, baby.
We ain't got nothin' to talk about.


134
0:12:6,536 --> 0:12:8,959
Unless it starts
with you saying, "I'm sorry".


135
0:12:8,959 --> 0:12:10,996
You're on
dangerous grounds here, Bob.


136
0:12:10,996 --> 0:12:13,765
I'd be very careful what
comes outta your mouth next.


137
0:12:13,765 --> 0:12:17,492
Oh... You wanna hear what...
what comes outta my mouth next?


138
0:12:17,492 --> 0:12:19,405
You're...


139
0:12:19,405 --> 0:12:20,886
a...


140
0:12:20,886 --> 0:12:22,624
fucking...


141
0:12:22,624 --> 0:12:25,745
pig.


142
0:12:25,745 --> 0:12:28,414
- You're under arrest.
- Oh, no.


143
0:12:28,414 --> 0:12:31,751
I ain't under arrest. You're
under arrest. I'm arresting your ass.


144
0:12:31,751 --> 0:12:35,521
Citizen's arrest. You're under
arrest for legal false arrest.


145
0:12:35,521 --> 0:12:37,823
Now, get your hands up on the car!
And give me those cuffs.


146
0:12:37,823 --> 0:12:39,859
Back off!
I'm warning you.


147
0:12:39,859 --> 0:12:43,429
You're warnin' me? Uh-ha.
You have the right to shut the hell up.


148
0:12:43,429 --> 0:12:45,531
All right, that's it.
Get up against the car!


149
0:12:45,531 --> 0:12:47,533
Don't make me add "resisting arrest"
to the charges.


150
0:12:47,533 --> 0:12:50,136
Now! Up against the car!


151
0:12:50,136 --> 0:12:52,689
Hey, watch my car, okay?
I just had it detailed.


152
0:12:52,689 --> 0:12:56,809
- Just settle down! You understand?
- This is police brutality!


153
0:12:56,809 --> 0:12:59,929
Okay? And you ain't doing nothin'
but compounding your problem.


154
0:12:59,929 --> 0:13:4,528
- I've had enough of your crap!
- I've told you, man. Get off me.


155
0:13:4,528 --> 0:13:6,243
Whoa! Whoa!


156
0:13:6,243 --> 0:13:9,23
- What?
- There's a big-ass bumblebee behind you!


157
0:13:9,23 --> 0:13:12,24
You don't think
I'm gonna fall for that crap, do you?


158
0:13:12,24 --> 0:13:14,984
I'm allergic to bees.
If I get stung...


159
0:13:14,984 --> 0:13:18,13
I'm-a seize up
and die.


160
0:13:18,13 --> 0:13:22,134
What? Just ignore him
and he won't touch you.


161
0:13:22,134 --> 0:13:26,272
- Yeah. All right.
- Look! Right there.


162
0:13:26,272 --> 0:13:30,609
I'm-a tell you...


163
0:13:30,609 --> 0:13:32,845
Help! Help! He's tryin'...
he's tryin' to kill me!


164
0:13:32,845 --> 0:13:37,16
- Help! Help! He's tryin' to kill me!
- Get down! I got him!


165
0:13:37,16 --> 0:13:39,451
Don't kill me!


166
0:13:39,451 --> 0:13:44,79
I got him!


167
0:13:44,79 --> 0:13:46,225
He's tryin' to kill me!


168
0:13:46,225 --> 0:13:48,427
<i>What you are seeing

Los Angeles police officer, Hank Rafferty,</i>

unidentified black male. </i>


171

<i>taken after the beating, his face

vicious beating of a black suspect</i>

0:14:30,35 --> 0:14:33,272
<i>please, be patient and
trust us to do our jobs. </i>


182
0:14:33,272 --> 0:14:41,614
<i>Clearly, this is
an isolated incident. </i>


183
0:14:41,614 --> 0:14:49,588
- It was a bee.
- Get the hell outta here.


184
0:14:49,588 --> 0:14:52,925
Mr. Montgomery, this
is detective McDuff,


185
0:14:52,925 --> 0:14:56,962
lieutenant Washington and
District Attorney Robert Barton.


186
0:14:56,962 --> 0:15:0,699
- Morning.
- Good morning. Call me.


187
0:15:0,699 --> 0:15:3,666
I'm serious.
Giggler. All right.


188
0:15:3,666 --> 0:15:8,307
Weren't you on TV last night?
Oh, snap, that is you.


189
0:15:8,307 --> 0:15:11,477
- What's up, man?
- What happened to your face?


190
0:15:11,477 --> 0:15:13,726
I was attacked by one
of your deranged officers.


191
0:15:13,726 --> 0:15:14,783
What you think happened?


192
0:15:14,783 --> 0:15:17,349
No, I mean, what happened
to the swelling and the bruises?


193
0:15:17,349 --> 0:15:20,986
Oh, that. That ain't nothin'
but allergies. You know, bee stings.


194
0:15:20,986 --> 0:15:22,254
Come again?


195
0:15:22,254 --> 0:15:25,424
Y'all mind
if I have a seat? Cool.


196
0:15:25,424 --> 0:15:27,963
I mean, y'all gonna
ask a brother all these questions,


197
0:15:27,963 --> 0:15:29,358
you don't even
offer me the seat.


198
0:15:29,358 --> 0:15:31,33
What's happenin'?


199
0:15:31,33 --> 0:15:32,665
All right. Well, um...


200
0:15:32,665 --> 0:15:37,469
While I was being slammed into the car,
having... billy clubs jammed into my neck,


201
0:15:37,469 --> 0:15:40,306
that psychotic storm trooper
y'all call a cop


202
0:15:40,306 --> 0:15:44,91
also allowed this big-ass bumblebee
to nearly sting me to death.


203
0:15:44,91 --> 0:15:48,814
You know what? I'm not even sure
that that bee wasn't one o' his own.


204
0:15:48,814 --> 0:15:54,845
You know, like some anti-Africanized
attack bee, trained to hate black people.


205
0:15:54,845 --> 0:15:57,95
But, you know what?
That's the sort of thing that, uh,


206
0:15:57,95 --> 0:16:0,299
y'all gonna uncover in the course
of your... your-your investigation,


207
0:16:0,299 --> 0:16:2,784
so, ptss, I ain't trippin'.


208
0:16:2,784 --> 0:16:6,332
- Would you excuse us for just a moment?
- Ptss, do your thing, man.


209
0:16:6,332 --> 0:16:12,71
Thank you.


210
0:16:12,71 --> 0:16:14,673
We can't put this guy
on the stand.


211
0:16:14,673 --> 0:16:19,778
- He's unstable. Not to mention that he...
- Yo.


212
0:16:19,778 --> 0:16:24,65
Who's the Planet-of-the-Apes-lookin'
lady in the dress?


213
0:16:24,65 --> 0:16:29,555
- That's my father.
- Handsome man.


214
0:16:29,555 --> 0:16:31,9
I don't believe this.


215
0:16:31,9 --> 0:16:33,42
I don't either. I'm calling off
the pull-am. This is crazy...


216
0:16:33,42 --> 0:16:33,947
Hold, it, hold it.


217
0:16:33,947 --> 0:16:37,283
Look. You like this guy or not,
Hank Rafferty violated his rights


218
0:16:37,283 --> 0:16:39,231
and people of this city
are not gonna look the other way.


219
0:16:39,231 --> 0:16:41,2
We can't go
through this again.


220
0:16:41,2 --> 0:16:42,383
You can drop
the prosecution,


221
0:16:42,383 --> 0:16:47,873
I guarantee you
you got a riot on your hands.


222
0:16:47,873 --> 0:16:50,895
Earl, do you, uh...
you work?


223
0:16:50,895 --> 0:16:53,209
I mean, do you have
a... steady job?


224
0:16:53,209 --> 0:16:55,914
Yes, I work.
I work in security, man.


225
0:16:55,914 --> 0:16:56,621
Ah.


226
0:16:56,621 --> 0:16:58,701
That's just until
I get back in the academy.


227
0:16:58,701 --> 0:17:1,97
- I see.
- Speakin' o' which, you know what?


228
0:17:1,97 --> 0:17:4,59
- Y'all need to investigate them...
- Mr. Montgomery...


229
0:17:4,59 --> 0:17:9,94
all allergies aside,
did officer Rafferty assault you or not?


230
0:17:9,94 --> 0:17:11,782
How many times
I gotta say it?


231
0:17:11,782 --> 0:17:16,612
All right.
Let's get down to business.


232
0:17:16,612 --> 0:17:19,59
Superior Court of the County
of Los Angeles is now in session.


233
0:17:19,59 --> 0:17:21,65
Please be seated.


234
0:17:21,65 --> 0:17:24,43
People of the state of California
versus Henry Rafferty.


235
0:17:24,43 --> 0:17:30,516
Case no. CV-34259.
Honorable Marsha Gailey presiding.


236
0:17:30,516 --> 0:17:35,954
Okay. It's at this time that the bee appeared.
Right here. There it is. It's coming in.


237
0:17:35,954 --> 0:17:37,79
You can't...


238
0:17:37,79 --> 0:17:43,432
You can't really see it
on... the tape, but it... it's there.


239
0:17:43,432 --> 0:17:44,496
Okay.


240
0:17:44,496 --> 0:17:48,434
I'm swatting it
with my... stick.


241
0:17:48,434 --> 0:17:54,306
There I am, stomping on it,
with the heel of my boot.


242
0:17:54,306 --> 0:17:57,335
Kept missin' it.


243
0:17:57,335 --> 0:17:59,78
Not a good angle.


244
0:17:59,78 --> 0:18:0,592
So, Mr. Montgomery,
are you claiming


245
0:18:0,592 --> 0:18:4,274
there was no bumblebee present
at the time of the incident?


246
0:18:4,274 --> 0:18:5,897
No, I'm not.


247
0:18:5,897 --> 0:18:10,402
- There was a bumblebee present, man.
- Oh, good.


248
0:18:10,402 --> 0:18:14,159
And there were birds chirpin'...
There were dogs barking...


249
0:18:14,159 --> 0:18:20,432
Hell, for all I know, there was a chipmunk
in the bushes, humpin' a turtle.


250
0:18:20,432 --> 0:18:22,385
You know, you gotta be careful
with them chipmunks.


251
0:18:22,385 --> 0:18:27,573
They'll-they'll hump anythin'.


252
0:18:27,573 --> 0:18:30,811
This is no laughing matter,
Mr. Montgomery.


253
0:18:30,811 --> 0:18:34,729
Look, man, I came here for justice.
Okay, that man right there?


254
0:18:34,729 --> 0:18:37,335
That man harassed
and choked me.


255
0:18:37,335 --> 0:18:39,51
He used excessive violence


256
0:18:39,51 --> 0:18:45,891
way before there was or
was not a bumblebee, sir.


257
0:18:45,891 --> 0:18:47,508
I know the score.


258
0:18:47,508 --> 0:18:51,33
It's not the first time
I been pulled over for DWB.


259
0:18:51,33 --> 0:18:54,633
- DWB?
- Driving While Black.


260
0:18:54,633 --> 0:19:0,472
- Move to strike!
- Kiss my ass.


261
0:19:0,472 --> 0:19:4,676
Will the defendant
please rise?


262
0:19:4,676 --> 0:19:10,983
The jury has found you
guilty as charged.


263
0:19:10,983 --> 0:19:17,723
You are hereby sentenced to serve
six months in a state penitentiary.


264
0:19:17,723 --> 0:19:21,927
- Murphy.
- Okay, move along.


265
0:19:21,927 --> 0:19:27,966
- Keep it moving.
- Rafferty.


266
0:19:27,966 --> 0:19:31,303
You must be that white cop, huh?
Beat up the black guy.


267
0:19:31,303 --> 0:19:39,845
- What makes you say that?
- Them.


268
0:19:39,845 --> 0:19:52,991
Oh, man.


269
0:19:52,991 --> 0:19:54,293
Hey, ase.


270
0:19:54,293 --> 0:19:57,663
Save your strength.
You're gonna need it.


271
0:19:57,663 --> 0:20:0,632
- You look cute, baby.
- Get goin'.


272
0:20:0,632 --> 0:20:15,881
Look, don't mess with me
or I'll throw your ass in solitary.


273
0:20:15,881 --> 0:20:20,519
All right, let's go.
You're out of the hole.


274
0:20:20,519 --> 0:20:38,804
- Hey, how long have I been in here?
- Three months.


275
0:20:38,804 --> 0:20:40,439
Congratulations.


276
0:20:40,439 --> 0:20:44,509
You are the graduating class
of this third week of August.


277
0:20:44,509 --> 0:20:48,513
Many people don't make it through
both days of intense training.


278
0:20:48,513 --> 0:20:50,616
You are the elite.


279
0:20:50,616 --> 0:20:54,386
Wherever you go, you'll be
part of this special fraternity.


280
0:20:54,386 --> 0:20:57,623
You're equipped with everything
you'll need to do your job:


281
0:20:57,623 --> 0:20:59,424
flashlight...


282
0:20:59,424 --> 0:21:1,426
pepper spray...


283
0:21:1,426 --> 0:21:4,696
and if things get
really nasty...


284
0:21:4,696 --> 0:21:8,333
a coin holster full of quarters,
so you can call the police.


285
0:21:8,333 --> 0:21:18,122
Congratulations.


286
0:21:18,122 --> 0:21:19,894
What do you mean,
you got nothin'?


287
0:21:19,894 --> 0:21:22,214
You had a crime scene,
physical evidence.


288
0:21:22,214 --> 0:21:25,183
- I gave you a goddamn tattoo.
- Which was a ghost.


289
0:21:25,183 --> 0:21:27,413
We couldn't find
anything on it in the database.


290
0:21:27,413 --> 0:21:29,571
Look,
these things take time, Hank.


291
0:21:29,571 --> 0:21:33,292
- Oh, please...
- Holy cow, check it out. Hank Rafferty...


292
0:21:33,292 --> 0:21:34,96
a security guard.


293
0:21:34,96 --> 0:21:48,307
Yeah, nobody throw gum on the ground,
okay? We'd get, like, a... a warning.


294
0:21:48,307 --> 0:21:52,544
<i>District 21 units, additional
on the ADW in progress. </i>


295
0:21:52,544 --> 0:21:55,681
<i>Suspect, male white,
blue jacket, brown pants. </i>


296
0:21:55,681 --> 0:22:16,335
<i>Male black, green shirt, brown pants.
Fled eastbound on foot. </i>


297
0:22:16,335 --> 0:22:21,773
Excuse me.
You ever see that?


298
0:22:21,773 --> 0:22:26,478
<i>4-59. Silent alarm, A & L
Beverages, 18th and Main. </i>


299
0:22:26,478 --> 0:22:29,614
<i>Cancel that. Must have
been a power glitch. </i>


300
0:22:29,614 --> 0:22:59,177
Gotcha.


301
0:22:59,177 --> 0:23:6,184
Where's security?


302
0:23:6,184 --> 0:23:8,32
Freeze!


303
0:23:8,32 --> 0:23:10,222
What are you doin'?


304
0:23:10,222 --> 0:23:14,159
The lights went out,
and I couldn't find a switch.


305
0:23:14,159 --> 0:23:16,228
So I was filing
in the dark.


306
0:23:16,228 --> 0:23:19,3
That's why
I called you here.


307
0:23:19,3 --> 0:23:20,465
Lola...


308
0:23:20,465 --> 0:23:25,404
filing in the dark is a serious offense.
You're in a lot of trouble.


309
0:23:25,404 --> 0:23:27,43
Get up against that wall.


310
0:23:27,43 --> 0:23:29,74
What are you gonna
do to me?


311
0:23:29,74 --> 0:23:37,382
Search you. Make sure you
ain't carrying any concealed weapons.


312
0:23:37,382 --> 0:23:39,418
You finding anything?


313
0:23:39,418 --> 0:23:41,453
- Is this a thong?
- What?


314
0:23:41,453 --> 0:23:49,628
Is this a thong?!


315
0:23:49,628 --> 0:23:51,83
Are you gonna
strip-search me?


316
0:23:51,83 --> 0:23:53,765
No.


317
0:23:53,765 --> 0:23:55,6
I'm-a put on some music.


318
0:23:55,6 --> 0:24:2,707
You gonna
strip-search yourself.


319
0:24:2,707 --> 0:24:11,783
Whoa, whoa, slow it up for me.
Nice and easy. Yeah.


320
0:24:11,783 --> 0:24:14,986
Can't get enough
of your love, babe!


321
0:24:14,986 --> 0:24:17,522
Yo, pass those two.


322
0:24:17,522 --> 0:24:20,525
- Get the motherboard.
- Check those boxes, man.


323
0:24:20,525 --> 0:24:23,28
Got it. Load them up.
Get them out of here.


324
0:24:23,28 --> 0:24:25,96
We have to check the load.


325
0:24:25,96 --> 0:24:27,287
Oh, yeah, Earl.


326
0:24:27,287 --> 0:24:32,3
No. Don't call me Earl.
Call me "officer".


327
0:24:32,3 --> 0:24:34,573
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah, yeah.


328
0:24:34,573 --> 0:24:39,211
Are you gonna give it
to me now, officer?


329
0:24:39,211 --> 0:24:41,847
Hell, yeah.


330
0:24:41,847 --> 0:24:46,518
I'm-a incarcerate you.


331
0:24:46,518 --> 0:24:50,822
You know my style.
I like it wild.


332
0:24:50,822 --> 0:24:57,562
- All right, pass that over here.
- No, I got it.


333
0:24:57,562 --> 0:25:0,932
Freeze!


334
0:25:0,932 --> 0:25:6,938
Hands up!


335
0:25:6,938 --> 0:25:12,277
What was that?


336
0:25:12,277 --> 0:25:14,412
I said "freeze"!


337
0:25:14,412 --> 0:25:16,248
You, behind there!


338
0:25:16,248 --> 0:25:19,217
Wait here. Might get
a little dangerous.


339
0:25:19,217 --> 0:25:22,187
You really playin' this thing
out, aren't you, baby?


340
0:25:22,187 --> 0:25:22,32
Talk to me about a hit
six months ago. Centurion Storage!


341
0:25:22,32 --> 0:25:25,49
Talk to me about a hit six
months ago, Centurion Storage!


342
0:25:25,49 --> 0:25:30,864
- Go to hell.
- We wondered where security was.


343
0:25:30,864 --> 0:25:33,732
Drop the weapon.


344
0:25:33,732 --> 0:25:37,644
You should have run when
you had the chance.


345
0:25:37,644 --> 0:25:41,891
Now you got no chance.


346
0:25:41,891 --> 0:25:58,39
Over there!
There he is! Get 'im!


347
0:25:58,39 --> 0:26:1,393
Somebody shoot them!


348
0:26:1,393 --> 0:26:4,93
- Thanks.
- No sweat.


349
0:26:4,93 --> 0:26:6,557
What the hell
are you doin' here?


350
0:26:6,557 --> 0:26:8,106
I work here!
What the hell you doin' here?


351
0:26:8,106 --> 0:26:11,102
You little punk! I spent six months
in prison because o' you!


352
0:26:11,102 --> 0:26:21,98
Six months? That's all they
gave you, six months?


353
0:26:21,98 --> 0:26:27,552
Damn it, Earl! This
ain't turnin' me on!


354
0:26:27,552 --> 0:26:30,722
- What the hell is that?
- Earl Junior.


355
0:26:30,722 --> 0:26:35,126
Likes to hang out with daddy.
Precious, ain't it?


356
0:26:35,126 --> 0:26:39,197
Get the goods!
Load them up! Now!


357
0:26:39,197 --> 0:26:42,0
- Cover me!
- Hey, man, you ain't my boss.


358
0:26:42,0 --> 0:26:44,2
Well, I say, we work
for the same company.


359
0:26:44,2 --> 0:26:50,875
Since I got seniority,
you cover me.


360
0:26:50,875 --> 0:27:20,763
- Okay, I cover you.
- Go!


361
0:27:20,763 --> 0:27:24,711
No! My car!


362
0:27:24,711 --> 0:27:29,396
No, not my car!


363
0:27:29,396 --> 0:27:31,85
Somebody shoot that monkey!


364
0:27:31,85 --> 0:27:40,659
What did you call me?


365
0:27:40,659 --> 0:27:56,174
Let's go. Now!


366
0:27:56,174 --> 0:27:57,942
Get them in here!


367
0:27:57,942 --> 0:28:27,672
Go, go, go, go!


368
0:28:27,672 --> 0:28:30,3
- Get outta my car!
- Why, cause I'm a black man?


369
0:28:30,3 --> 0:28:32,711
Look, this has nothing to do
with you. It's personal!


370
0:28:32,711 --> 0:28:37,215
You damn right it's personal. White boy
back there called me "monkey". Drive!


371
0:28:37,215 --> 0:28:39,818
- Get out, now!
- Look, man.


372
0:28:39,818 --> 0:28:43,565
I been waiting my whole life
for shit like this to go down. Okay?


373
0:28:43,565 --> 0:28:45,273
If you gonna shoot me,
shoot me.


374
0:28:45,273 --> 0:28:49,861
That's the only way
I'm gettin' out outta this car.


375
0:28:49,861 --> 0:28:59,738
They getting away, man!
Come on! Get, go!


376
0:28:59,738 --> 0:29:5,43
Earl?


377
0:29:5,43 --> 0:29:8,947
Man, this slow-ass...
damn... Flintstone car, man,


378
0:29:8,947 --> 0:29:11,716
we might as well be...
pedaling with our damn feet.


379
0:29:11,716 --> 0:29:13,827
What the hell is wrong
with this piece of junk?


380
0:29:13,827 --> 0:29:14,819
Yeah, I don't know.


381
0:29:14,819 --> 0:29:17,238
You know, I was gonna take it in
for a regular scheduled maintenance,


382
0:29:17,238 --> 0:29:20,391
but, uh, for the past six months
I've been in prison!


383
0:29:20,391 --> 0:29:22,115
Hey, man,
you should've got more time.


384
0:29:22,115 --> 0:29:25,663
Pushin' me into cars and.. and-and
puttin' me in satanic chokeholds.


385
0:29:25,663 --> 0:29:28,707
You were resisting arrest! I was
authorized to use any force...


386
0:29:28,707 --> 0:29:29,985
Hey, hey, look, man! Look.


387
0:29:29,985 --> 0:29:33,286
We could go back and
forth on this all night long, man.


388
0:29:33,286 --> 0:29:35,84
Fortunately, there are courts
to handle this matter.


389
0:29:35,84 --> 0:29:37,375
And according
to the courts,


390
0:29:37,375 --> 0:29:42,714
you were assaulting and battering
me like a hillbilly on his wife.


391
0:29:42,714 --> 0:29:55,236
Yo, yo, yo!


392
0:29:55,236 --> 0:30:4,569
Oh, oh, oh. Shit. This is how
I'm gonna conceal the weapon.


393
0:30:4,569 --> 0:30:6,504
Pull over! Pull over!


394
0:30:6,504 --> 0:30:9,307
Get the van!


395
0:30:9,307 --> 0:30:14,829
- You pull over, buddy!
- No, get the van!


396
0:30:14,829 --> 0:30:16,681
- Drop the gun!
- The van!


397
0:30:16,681 --> 0:30:20,618
- Drop it!
- Get the v... Get...


398
0:30:20,618 --> 0:30:21,886
Damn!


399
0:30:21,886 --> 0:30:24,722
If I would've gotten out
with a wallet in my hand


400
0:30:24,722 --> 0:30:26,925
I'd have bullets
all in my ass!


401
0:30:26,925 --> 0:30:33,398
That's some bullshit, man.


402
0:30:33,398 --> 0:30:37,1
Security guard, huh, Hank?


403
0:30:37,1 --> 0:30:38,269
That's a shame.


404
0:30:38,269 --> 0:30:41,448
- Hey, Washington, how are you doing?
- Better than you.


405
0:30:41,448 --> 0:30:44,632
- You okay, man?
- You know how it is, my brother.


406
0:30:44,632 --> 0:30:47,946
Just a little shaken up,
that's all.


407
0:30:47,946 --> 0:30:50,991
Let me see...
if I got this figured out.


408
0:30:50,991 --> 0:30:53,818
You get out of prison,
pissed with your life,


409
0:30:53,818 --> 0:30:57,655
you decide to pay your old buddy Earl
here a little visit. Things got out of hand,


410
0:30:57,655 --> 0:31:2,604
shots are fired, police respond just
in time to catch Hank trying to get away


411
0:31:2,604 --> 0:31:6,927
with you in his car, probably
holding you at gunpoint. Am I correct?


412
0:31:6,927 --> 0:31:11,665
Amazing.
You are very, very good.


413
0:31:11,665 --> 0:31:15,64
Oh, wait a second. This is crazy.
I di... I wasn't out for revenge.


414
0:31:15,64 --> 0:31:18,628
Shut the hell up, Hank!
Just shut the hell up.


415
0:31:18,628 --> 0:31:20,511
I'm tired of
your goddamn lies.


416
0:31:20,511 --> 0:31:22,589
I got a restraining order
that says


417
0:31:22,589 --> 0:31:25,374
you cannot get within
100 feet of this guy, okay?


418
0:31:25,374 --> 0:31:29,153
So, I don't really give a damn what
you have to say. All I need from you...


419
0:31:29,153 --> 0:31:35,827
is your testimony and his ass
goes back to prison. Tomorrow.


420
0:31:35,827 --> 0:31:41,499
Nothing would make me happier...
than to see this man go back to prison.


421
0:31:41,499 --> 0:31:43,534
Good.


422
0:31:43,534 --> 0:31:49,269
For... for the heartache...
and the trauma.


423
0:31:49,269 --> 0:31:52,43
One time he took the club
and he switched it around


424
0:31:52,43 --> 0:31:55,871
with the handle sticking out
and bop, right there.


425
0:31:55,871 --> 0:32:0,402
Can you see that little cut,
right there? Anyway...


426
0:32:0,402 --> 0:32:5,256
What happens is it makes
me start saying inco-herent...


427
0:32:5,256 --> 0:32:10,328
You know, I'm liable to spurt that out.
Just incoherent shit. Bitch!


428
0:32:10,328 --> 0:32:12,931
I-I-I apologize.


429
0:32:12,931 --> 0:32:17,34
My doctor said that I'm not gettin'
the proper oxygen up through here.


430
0:32:17,34 --> 0:32:20,538
They said pump it and...
and breathe.


431
0:32:20,538 --> 0:32:25,43
And... it's sort of
like that sneaker.


432
0:32:25,43 --> 0:32:26,711
It's a weird exercise.


433
0:32:26,711 --> 0:32:30,715
Anyway, nothing would make me
happier than to see him go back to prison.


434
0:32:30,715 --> 0:32:33,184
- Wait a second here!
- Get back, bitch!


435
0:32:33,184 --> 0:32:40,491
- Shut the hell up, Hank, and I mean it!
- You... The violence.


436
0:32:40,491 --> 0:32:42,36
Let me calm myself.


437
0:32:42,36 --> 0:32:47,966
Unfortunately, certain details
of your story are slightly skewed.


438
0:32:47,966 --> 0:32:50,635
What do you mean,
skewed?


439
0:32:50,635 --> 0:32:55,506
Hank...
did not come back for revenge.


440
0:32:55,506 --> 0:33:1,713
- Thank you.
- He came back to apologize.


441
0:33:1,713 --> 0:33:5,717
- What?
- You went there to apologize?


442
0:33:5,717 --> 0:33:10,722
The man's talking to you.


443
0:33:10,722 --> 0:33:12,724
Yep.


444
0:33:12,724 --> 0:33:16,627
- And you were saying?
- I was...


445
0:33:16,627 --> 0:33:20,565
saying I was sorry.


446
0:33:20,565 --> 0:33:27,438
- For what?
- Beatin' you.


447
0:33:27,438 --> 0:33:34,12
Yeah. My dog. Ooh-ooh-ooh!
That's what I'm talkin' about, man.


448
0:33:34,12 --> 0:33:39,951
Hank was right in the middle
of this very touching apology...


449
0:33:39,951 --> 0:33:43,221
when I discovered that
my warehouse was being robbed.


450
0:33:43,221 --> 0:33:47,625
So Hank and I, we banded together
to apprehend these outlaws.


451
0:33:47,625 --> 0:33:51,963
And we would've had them,
had not your boys come along.


452
0:33:51,963 --> 0:33:53,631
Excuse me?


453
0:33:53,631 --> 0:33:57,657
Deputy Droop-a-long.
Man, they stopped the wrong car.


454
0:33:57,657 --> 0:34:0,805
- You better watch your mouth.
- What you gonna do?


455
0:34:0,805 --> 0:34:4,842
Beat the hell outta me?
Probably blame it on a damn spider.


456
0:34:4,842 --> 0:34:6,978
- What you got?
- The updated report.


457
0:34:6,978 --> 0:34:9,902
We got a 4-59 at the warehouse,
but nothing on a van.


458
0:34:9,902 --> 0:34:11,716
Coroner has two bodies.


459
0:34:11,716 --> 0:34:15,553
D.A. says self-defense,
so, uh, we kick 'em loose.


460
0:34:15,553 --> 0:34:21,563
- The C & L warehouse on 18th?
- Yeah.


461
0:34:21,563 --> 0:34:24,362
Not a cop anymore, Hank,
so stop acting like one.


462
0:34:24,362 --> 0:34:29,33
I'm all too happy to find any reason
to lock your ass up. You understand?


463
0:34:29,33 --> 0:34:33,371
Go find McDuff, tell him
I wanna see him right away.


464
0:34:33,371 --> 0:34:36,58
Oh, yeah, we also encountered
a naked girl upstairs,


465
0:34:36,58 --> 0:34:41,189
- handcuffed to a light fixture.
- Oh, Lola. Lola.


466
0:34:41,189 --> 0:34:45,85
Uh, you think you could hook a brother
up with another restraining order?


467
0:34:45,85 --> 0:34:50,588
Right there, cause I recognize them.
Great.


468
0:34:50,588 --> 0:34:55,326
All my stuff should be
in here too.


469
0:34:55,326 --> 0:34:57,795
What's up?


470
0:34:57,795 --> 0:35:2,333
Right.


471
0:35:2,333 --> 0:35:5,169
I don't believe this.
Where's my bullets?


472
0:35:5,169 --> 0:35:7,872
We don't return
live ammunition.


473
0:35:7,872 --> 0:35:11,175
Well, if you wanna keep the bullets,
why don't you just keep the gun?


474
0:35:11,175 --> 0:35:14,345
- All right.
- Give me my gun, man.


475
0:35:14,345 --> 0:35:16,347
Where's my car?


476
0:35:16,347 --> 0:35:22,22
Impound lot. Twenty blocks up,
seven blocks over.


477
0:35:22,22 --> 0:35:24,789
You expect that man
to walk...


478
0:35:24,789 --> 0:35:28,25
Y'all got a shuttle bus?
You know what?


479
0:35:28,25 --> 0:35:32,563
You upset my partner.
I should set it off up in this...


480
0:35:32,563 --> 0:35:36,267
But you got your boys.


481
0:35:36,267 --> 0:35:39,704
Hank, you believe
his attitude, man?


482
0:35:39,704 --> 0:35:44,175
Man, they probably gonna give you
your car back with no tires.


483
0:35:44,175 --> 0:35:46,498
I like the way you played it
back there, Hank.


484
0:35:46,498 --> 0:35:49,514
Yeah, not lettin' 'em in on our case.
That was smooth.


485
0:35:49,514 --> 0:35:52,35
- This is our bust, right, partner?
- Get the hell away from me!


486
0:35:52,35 --> 0:35:54,519
Hey, Hank!
You know what?


487
0:35:54,519 --> 0:35:57,389
Sooner or later,
your hostility is officially


488
0:35:57,389 --> 0:35:58,829
gonna start
affecting our work.


489
0:35:58,829 --> 0:36:1,325
Now, look, man.
All you got to do is kind of...


490
0:36:1,325 --> 0:36:3,981
What is you running for?
I'm tryin' to talk to you.


491
0:36:3,981 --> 0:36:7,131
Look! I am trying
to remain calm,


492
0:36:7,131 --> 0:36:10,401
because I know that if I hit you,
I will never see the light of day again,


493
0:36:10,401 --> 0:36:14,772
which right now seems
almost worth it. So don't push it!


494
0:36:14,772 --> 0:36:20,444
- You threatenin' me?
- Yeah! Yeah, I'm threatenin' ya!


495
0:36:20,444 --> 0:36:22,48
Well, bring it on.


496
0:36:22,48 --> 0:36:24,94
Bring it on, Hank.
I could have went pro.


497
0:36:24,94 --> 0:36:27,385
I drop bombs on 'em,
drop bombs on 'em.


498
0:36:27,385 --> 0:36:30,51
What? What? Right here,
slip, move, slide...


499
0:36:30,51 --> 0:36:32,86
Can't redial
without a signal.


500
0:36:32,86 --> 0:36:33,891
Oh, bang 'em outta there.


501
0:36:33,891 --> 0:36:37,128
Hey, where you goin',
man?


502
0:36:37,128 --> 0:36:39,197
- Shut up!
- Big Red Truck and Trailer.


503
0:36:39,197 --> 0:36:42,833
Truck and trailer. Yeah, look,
you guys got a call...


504
0:36:42,833 --> 0:36:46,3
uh, yesterday, I think it was, regarding
a white van that you rented out.


505
0:36:46,3 --> 0:36:47,484
<i>We only rent big rigs. </i>


506
0:36:47,484 --> 0:36:50,257
Oh. Yeah, well, maybe
you can help me out.


507
0:36:50,257 --> 0:36:51,788
I'm tryin' to find
a couple of my buddies.


508
0:36:51,788 --> 0:36:56,145
Uh... Uh... I think they rented
a truck from you... yesterday.


509
0:36:56,145 --> 0:36:58,716
<i>- What name is it under?
- No, I don't know their names.</i>


510
0:36:58,716 --> 0:37:2,22
<i>- Listen, pal, we get a lot of people here.
- No, I...</i>


511
0:37:2,22 --> 0:37:6,224
- You listen.
- Give me the phone.


512
0:37:6,224 --> 0:37:8,593
- Where you located?
- Downtown, on Normandie.


513
0:37:8,593 --> 0:37:11,362
South Central?
These were white folks.


514
0:37:11,362 --> 0:37:14,198
<i>Oh, they just left.
Bought extra insurance for Baja. </i>


515
0:37:14,198 --> 0:37:15,8
- Headin' to Mexico?
- I guess.


516
0:37:15,8 --> 0:37:18,502
Thank you.


517
0:37:18,502 --> 0:37:20,319
You're welcome.


518
0:37:20,319 --> 0:37:23,507
The way I see it,
they got a 20-minute head start.


519
0:37:23,507 --> 0:37:26,644
They're probably
headin' down the 405.


520
0:37:26,644 --> 0:37:28,546
What are you doin'?


521
0:37:28,546 --> 0:37:33,684
Stop the car!
National Security!


522
0:37:33,684 --> 0:37:37,54
Stop the damn car!


523
0:37:37,54 --> 0:37:39,991
National Security.
I'm commandeering this vehicle.


524
0:37:39,991 --> 0:37:44,895
- What did I do?
- Oh, student driver, huh?


525
0:37:44,895 --> 0:37:51,2
Well, lesson 12: Man with gun,
get your ass up out the car.


526
0:37:51,2 --> 0:37:52,837
- Go!
- Okay, okay, don't shoot.


527
0:37:52,837 --> 0:37:57,108
And do your homework!


528
0:37:57,108 --> 0:38:2,78
What the problem is?


529
0:38:2,78 --> 0:38:9,387
Hey, man. Do I gotta solve
this crime by myself?


530
0:38:9,387 --> 0:38:22,566
Unbelievable.


531
0:38:22,566 --> 0:38:26,437
Big, red truck.
It's gonna be easy to find.


532
0:38:26,437 --> 0:38:30,574
It's probably gonna say "Big Red"
all along the side of... the truck...


533
0:38:30,574 --> 0:38:33,179
in big, red letters.


534
0:38:33,179 --> 0:38:36,387
Hey, Hank, you know that file
back at Washington's office?


535
0:38:36,387 --> 0:38:41,52
Well, I used my acute peripheral vision
to get a upside-down read.


536
0:38:41,52 --> 0:38:43,821
- Wanna know what I saw?
- What?


537
0:38:43,821 --> 0:38:49,62
On one of them papers
it said "CIA heist".


538
0:38:49,62 --> 0:38:50,428
And?


539
0:38:50,428 --> 0:38:52,942
- That's all I saw, "CIA".
- That's it?


540
0:38:52,942 --> 0:38:57,735
Hey, look, man, I said I got peripheral
vision, not X-ray vision, man. All right?


541
0:38:57,735 --> 0:39:0,574
Now, apparently, we are
caught up in some real live


542
0:39:0,574 --> 0:39:5,109
complex-ass, espionage shit.


543
0:39:5,109 --> 0:39:7,345
This is great,
man, ain't it?


544
0:39:7,345 --> 0:39:12,45
Me and you, man, we're security guards
out here acting like real cops.


545
0:39:12,45 --> 0:39:16,62
- I was a real cop, Earl.
- Well, you must've loved it, huh?


546
0:39:16,62 --> 0:39:21,659
I can't believe
you gave that up.


547
0:39:21,659 --> 0:39:24,895
Yeah. There's Route 1.


548
0:39:24,895 --> 0:39:27,233
Now, just stay on the freeway,
it's a lot faster.


549
0:39:27,233 --> 0:39:30,101
No. No, they wanna keep a low profile.
They're gonna go Route 1.


550
0:39:30,101 --> 0:39:34,205
Stay on the freeway.
No, on the freeway, come on.


551
0:39:34,205 --> 0:39:37,41
- Don't!
- Oh, shit!


552
0:39:37,41 --> 0:39:39,877
- Hey, come on!
- Freeway traffic, man.


553
0:39:39,877 --> 0:39:42,646
- Stay on the freeway.
- We're in the middle of the street.


554
0:39:42,646 --> 0:39:45,349
What are you doing?!


555
0:39:45,349 --> 0:39:47,418
- Let go of the wheel!
- Freeway!


556
0:39:47,418 --> 0:39:50,554
What are you doin',
Hank?!


557
0:39:50,554 --> 0:40:9,473
Oh, shit!


558
0:40:9,473 --> 0:40:12,156
- God! Are you okay?
- Yeah.


559
0:40:12,156 --> 0:40:14,745
- Shit.
- Hey!


560
0:40:14,745 --> 0:40:18,416
Sorry.


561
0:40:18,416 --> 0:40:20,771
Look like somebody was right
about the freeway.


562
0:40:20,771 --> 0:40:21,552
What?


563
0:40:21,552 --> 0:40:25,256
Look at that. You can't tell me
that ain't a big, red truck.


564
0:40:25,256 --> 0:40:34,632
Yeah, yeah.


565
0:40:34,632 --> 0:40:39,103
Gun. Under the seat.


566
0:40:39,103 --> 0:40:41,183
Hank! Hank!


567
0:40:41,183 --> 0:40:44,708
Hank! Hank!


568
0:40:44,708 --> 0:40:47,311
Get off me!


569
0:40:47,311 --> 0:40:49,513
- Hey!
- Shoot 'er, Hank.


570
0:40:49,513 --> 0:40:52,82
Shoot this big bitch, man.
Hank's about to shoot you.


571
0:40:52,82 --> 0:40:54,819
No, I ain't gonna shoot anybody.
Put him down...


572
0:40:54,819 --> 0:40:57,455
in a minute or two.
No hurry.


573
0:40:57,455 --> 0:40:59,764
I don't like nobody
messin' with my rig.


574
0:40:59,764 --> 0:41:6,597
Don't be a pussy, Hank.
Shoot 'er!


575
0:41:6,597 --> 0:41:11,902
You oversized, big-boot,
thick-ass, Jerry Springer-reject ass...


576
0:41:11,902 --> 0:41:14,338
- Earl, come on. Let's go.
- No, man.


577
0:41:14,338 --> 0:41:18,943
Shaq here
owes me an apology.


578
0:41:18,943 --> 0:41:20,911
But then again...


579
0:41:20,911 --> 0:41:24,59
- what your name is?
- Brittany.


580
0:41:24,59 --> 0:41:30,154
Yeah?


581
0:41:30,154 --> 0:41:33,924
Got a ring on every finger
except that lockdown one, huh?


582
0:41:33,924 --> 0:41:44,768
You like to wrestle?
Cause that's my thing. I like to wrestle.


583
0:41:44,768 --> 0:41:49,39
Earl. Earl, come on,
let's go.


584
0:41:49,39 --> 0:41:50,975
Why don't you
give me your number?


585
0:41:50,975 --> 0:41:57,848
And if you're nice, I'll show you
what a real big rig looks like.


586
0:41:57,848 --> 0:42:0,15
Earl, come on!


587
0:42:0,15 --> 0:42:2,72
- I'll call you.
- Let's go, let's go! The truck's leaving.


588
0:42:2,72 --> 0:42:13,697
- I'm with you. Hold on, hold on.
- Come on!


589
0:42:13,697 --> 0:42:18,869
- Think these are our guys?
- How the hell am I supposed to know?


590
0:42:18,869 --> 0:42:21,472
No, wait. Wait.
Oh, wait. No, no.


591
0:42:21,472 --> 0:42:24,208
Sorry.


592
0:42:24,208 --> 0:42:25,709
Earl!


593
0:42:25,709 --> 0:42:27,63
Earl, come on!


594
0:42:27,63 --> 0:42:32,583
Come on, come on!


595
0:42:32,583 --> 0:42:36,72
Swing around!


596
0:42:36,72 --> 0:42:43,46
Oh, my knee!


597
0:42:43,46 --> 0:42:45,296
Oh, shit.


598
0:42:45,296 --> 0:42:57,641
Hey, come on!
Come on, come on.


599
0:42:57,641 --> 0:43:0,11
- You did that on purpose.
- Look.


600
0:43:0,11 --> 0:43:5,649
So that's why the cops
couldn't find the van.


601
0:43:5,649 --> 0:43:8,185
Hey, do you know how
to hot-wire a car?


602
0:43:8,185 --> 0:43:13,958
Oh, cause I'm black, I... automatically
know how to hot-wire a car?


603
0:43:13,958 --> 0:43:16,99
- Hey, look. Do you know how or don't you?
- Yeah.


604
0:43:16,99 --> 0:43:22,533
- But not cause I'm black.
- Do it.


605
0:43:22,533 --> 0:43:26,971
- Move your leg, man. Close your legs.
- Get in there.


606
0:43:26,971 --> 0:43:29,414
- See that?
- All right. Go, go, go, go.


607
0:43:29,414 --> 0:43:30,674
Okay.


608
0:43:30,674 --> 0:43:33,41
See... see how that spark went when
one o' them bumped into each other?


609
0:43:33,41 --> 0:43:36,747
That's cause that red wire
is what gives off all that energy.


610
0:43:36,747 --> 0:43:39,65
- I don't care.
- See how that's sparking there?


611
0:43:39,65 --> 0:43:41,51
Got it?


612
0:43:41,51 --> 0:43:45,623
- How's that? What's that doin'?
- Earl, the windshield wipers are on.


613
0:43:45,623 --> 0:43:49,827
Must be a '94.
Touched the wrong one.


614
0:43:49,827 --> 0:43:52,563
How's that?


615
0:43:52,563 --> 0:43:56,133
- What's that?
- What the hell?


616
0:43:56,133 --> 0:44:0,4
- Turn it off. Turn it off!
- Oh, come on.


617
0:44:0,4 --> 0:44:15,686
Somebody's back in that trailer.
Let's take a look.


618
0:44:15,686 --> 0:44:32,169
Eddie, look out!


619
0:44:32,169 --> 0:44:39,443
- Do it. Come on, come on, come on.
- Yeah.


620
0:44:39,443 --> 0:45:4,635
Go!


621
0:45:4,635 --> 0:45:17,414
Oh, shit! Ooh!


622
0:45:17,414 --> 0:45:19,249
Thanks, Hank.


623
0:45:19,249 --> 0:45:27,191
That's the second time in 20 minutes
you landed us in some shit.


624
0:45:27,191 --> 0:45:31,295
Hey, you messin'
with Earl and Hank!


625
0:45:31,295 --> 0:45:33,831
What the problem is?


626
0:45:33,831 --> 0:45:36,2
You know? What the hell
is in these boxes.


627
0:45:36,2 --> 0:45:39,403
Oh, Hank!


628
0:45:39,403 --> 0:45:44,641
Oh, it stinks.


629
0:45:44,641 --> 0:45:49,413
- Oh, damn!
- Sorry.


630
0:45:49,413 --> 0:45:52,883
Damn, it looks
like Christmas.


631
0:45:52,883 --> 0:45:56,667
Except for these fish guts
and... orange peels.


632
0:45:56,667 --> 0:45:59,823
Please be guns.
Please be guns.


633
0:45:59,823 --> 0:46:4,94
What the hell is that?


634
0:46:4,94 --> 0:46:8,687
This is a beer keg.


635
0:46:8,687 --> 0:46:9,967
Doesn't make any sense.


636
0:46:9,967 --> 0:46:12,803
Makes a lot o' sense
when you put together all the pieces.


637
0:46:12,803 --> 0:46:15,639
What pieces?


638
0:46:15,639 --> 0:46:17,4
It's obvious.


639
0:46:17,4 --> 0:46:19,209
The CIA,
they're smuggling alcohol...


640
0:46:19,209 --> 0:46:23,171
into the inner city in an effort
to further subjugate the black man.


641
0:46:23,171 --> 0:46:28,111
Hey, do you actually believe the crap
that comes outta your mouth?


642
0:46:28,111 --> 0:46:33,557
Oh, I'm never really sure
till I'm finished talkin'.


643
0:46:33,557 --> 0:46:38,325
Think they all kegs?


644
0:46:38,325 --> 0:46:43,1
Yeah. Nash.
We got a problem.


645
0:46:43,1 --> 0:46:45,869
Well, what we have here
appears to be


646
0:46:45,869 --> 0:46:49,773
your average, garden-variety,
22-dollars-deposit beer keg


647
0:46:49,773 --> 0:46:51,608
but it's way too light.


648
0:46:51,608 --> 0:46:54,545
- It must be light beer.
- Yeah, way too light.


649
0:46:54,545 --> 0:46:59,817
Couldn't be a pound and a half.
Let's take a peek inside, huh?


650
0:46:59,817 --> 0:47:3,954
Yeah, she's empty all right.


651
0:47:3,954 --> 0:47:7,515
You think maybe there's a double wall?
Something stashed in between, hmm?


652
0:47:7,515 --> 0:47:9,726
Happy to take a look.


653
0:47:9,726 --> 0:47:19,2
Put on the glasses, boys,
or you will go blind.


654
0:47:19,2 --> 0:47:23,44
This torch burns
at 4000 degrees Fahrenheit...


655
0:47:23,44 --> 0:47:27,644
so let's slice open
this can o' peaches.


656
0:47:27,644 --> 0:47:37,354
Incredible.
She's cold as ice.


657
0:47:37,354 --> 0:47:38,922
Gorgeous.


658
0:47:38,922 --> 0:47:42,192
Why don't you
and the keg get a room?


659
0:47:42,192 --> 0:47:44,428
Gentlemen,
what we have here


660
0:47:44,428 --> 0:47:47,798
is an Area 51, high-tech,
aerospace alloy.


661
0:47:47,798 --> 0:47:51,268
Weighs next to nothing,
disperses heat instantaneously


662
0:47:51,268 --> 0:47:54,605
and is resistant to almost
any force in man or nature.


663
0:47:54,605 --> 0:47:56,84
Well, is it worth anything?


664
0:47:56,84 --> 0:47:59,71
Yeah, millions!


665
0:47:59,71 --> 0:48:1,934
Which is exactly why...


666
0:48:1,934 --> 0:48:6,35
I want you two to take this thing
and get the hell out of my shop.


667
0:48:6,35 --> 0:48:8,752
Personally, I don't feel
like dying right now...


668
0:48:8,752 --> 0:48:15,993
and this is exactly the kind o' shit
people get killed over.


669
0:48:15,993 --> 0:48:28,438
Thanks.


670
0:48:28,438 --> 0:48:31,684
We'll stash the van here
till we find out what's what.


671
0:48:31,684 --> 0:48:34,978
- Whose garage is this?
- This guy I know. It doesn't matter.


672
0:48:34,978 --> 0:48:39,483
Nah, nah. This ain't no guy garage.
There ain't a power tool in here.


673
0:48:39,483 --> 0:48:40,903
Let's go.


674
0:48:40,903 --> 0:48:44,21
Hank, this box up here
got your name on it.


675
0:48:44,21 --> 0:48:46,43
This wouldn't happen to be
your girlfriend's house, would it?


676
0:48:46,43 --> 0:48:49,526
Hey, Earl. Could you do me a favor?
Could you stay outta my business?


677
0:48:49,526 --> 0:48:54,704
Oh, well, lookie, lookie, lookie.
Looks like somebody got dissed, huh?


678
0:48:54,704 --> 0:48:56,742
A'it, let me guess, Hank.


679
0:48:56,742 --> 0:49:0,804
Uhh, your girl left because
you beat the shit out of her.


680
0:49:0,804 --> 0:49:3,74
No. Ironically, she left me


681
0:49:3,74 --> 0:49:8,178
because, uh, I was convicted
of beating the shit outta somebody else.


682
0:49:8,178 --> 0:49:10,147
Oh, me? Moi?


683
0:49:10,147 --> 0:49:14,84
Man, go ahead with that, man.
Look, Hank, I'm just saying, man...


684
0:49:14,84 --> 0:49:17,487
I suppose that's what
your attitude is all about? Huh?


685
0:49:17,487 --> 0:49:19,719
Hanky ain't gettin'
no lovin'.


686
0:49:19,719 --> 0:49:21,558
Hey, man, I'll be happy
to go back in there


687
0:49:21,558 --> 0:49:23,46
and straighten this
whole mess out for you.


688
0:49:23,46 --> 0:49:25,145
No, thanks, I think
you've done enough.


689
0:49:25,145 --> 0:49:27,664
Nah, nah, serious, Hank.
I wanna do it, man.


690
0:49:27,664 --> 0:49:31,168
Earl Montgomery is a love-maker,
not a love-taker.


691
0:49:31,168 --> 0:49:33,837
Wait a second.
Let me get this straight.


692
0:49:33,837 --> 0:49:36,573
You-you're telling me you'd go
in there and tell Denise


693
0:49:36,573 --> 0:49:39,676
that I never harassed you,
and I went to jail for no reason?


694
0:49:39,676 --> 0:49:41,812
Absolutely.


695
0:49:41,812 --> 0:49:46,683
But you and I both know
you got exactly what you deserve.


696
0:49:46,683 --> 0:49:49,553
Denise.


697
0:49:49,553 --> 0:49:52,823
I hope they don't think
we're breakin' in.


698
0:49:52,823 --> 0:49:57,16
She's not home.


699
0:49:57,16 --> 0:50:1,98
Damn. Denise got
one fine-looking maid.


700
0:50:1,98 --> 0:50:4,334
- Excuse me?
- Earl...


701
0:50:4,334 --> 0:50:9,773
that is Denise. Hey.


702
0:50:9,773 --> 0:50:12,542
- What do you want, Hank?
- I only wanna talk.


703
0:50:12,542 --> 0:50:13,977
- Oh, you wanna talk?
- Yeah.


704
0:50:13,977 --> 0:50:16,556
Or you wanna lie? Because
there's a difference, you know.


705
0:50:16,556 --> 0:50:18,92
I-I've always been honest
with you, Denise.


706
0:50:18,92 --> 0:50:19,547
Course you were.


707
0:50:19,547 --> 0:50:23,353
You just... forgot to tell me you were
beating up black men on your lunch hour.


708
0:50:23,353 --> 0:50:26,23
Oh, snap. She's witty.


709
0:50:26,23 --> 0:50:28,425
Yeah, yeah. She most definitely
got the upper hand.


710
0:50:28,425 --> 0:50:31,661
Hey, could you be quiet
for a minute? Thanks.


711
0:50:31,661 --> 0:50:34,731
- Look, I told you how...
- I know, I know, the bumblebee did it.


712
0:50:34,731 --> 0:50:36,8
- Yeah.
- You lied to me, Henry.


713
0:50:36,8 --> 0:50:40,604
Lies, lies.
Lies just compound lies.


714
0:50:40,604 --> 0:50:43,54
You know? But you sayin'
the same thing. Do your thing.


715
0:50:43,54 --> 0:50:46,943
I didn't beat anybody, okay?
And I can prove it.


716
0:50:46,943 --> 0:50:52,816
This is the man that I was accused
of assaulting. Okay, Earl.


717
0:50:52,816 --> 0:50:55,952
- Hi.
- You got somethin' you wanna say?


718
0:50:55,952 --> 0:50:58,488
Oh, yeah.


719
0:50:58,488 --> 0:51:1,792
She's black.
You never told me she was black.


720
0:51:1,792 --> 0:51:5,729
Did I or did I not
assault you?


721
0:51:5,729 --> 0:51:8,98
Oh, he beat the hell
outta me, ma'am.


722
0:51:8,98 --> 0:51:10,267
- What?
- Look, I'm not gonna lie to the sister.


723
0:51:10,267 --> 0:51:14,71
No, you're... You son of a bitch!
I'm not gonna take this!


724
0:51:14,71 --> 0:51:16,673
Hey! Get your hands off him.
Stop it. Get out.


725
0:51:16,673 --> 0:51:18,442
- Get out!
- Get out! Just get out!


726
0:51:18,442 --> 0:51:20,877
- Henry, get out!
- You too. Get out! Get!


727
0:51:20,877 --> 0:51:23,246
- But...
- Get!


728
0:51:23,246 --> 0:51:26,283
I think the violence
might kick off out there.


729
0:51:26,283 --> 0:51:29,453
Get out.


730
0:51:29,453 --> 0:51:33,457
Listen, man. Wait.
Why you all salty at me, man?


731
0:51:33,457 --> 0:51:38,628
Look, Hank, kill that noise, man.
Listen, it's not my fault. Okay?


732
0:51:38,628 --> 0:51:40,897
- You told me she was white.
- I did not.


733
0:51:40,897 --> 0:51:43,133
Well, you didn't tell me she was black,
so that's the same thing.


734
0:51:43,133 --> 0:51:45,669
- What difference does it make?
- Makes a big difference.


735
0:51:45,669 --> 0:51:48,905
Look, if I had lied and told her
that you didn't beat me up,


736
0:51:48,905 --> 0:51:51,575
I'd be condoning
interracial relationships.


737
0:51:51,575 --> 0:51:53,643
Which is somethin'
I do not condone.


738
0:51:53,643 --> 0:51:56,91
Okay, that's it. If you're not outta
my face in three seconds...


739
0:51:56,91 --> 0:52:0,517
Whoa! Now, you don't wanna be...
be threatenin' your partner.


740
0:52:0,517 --> 0:52:3,153
I am not your partner!


741
0:52:3,153 --> 0:52:6,456
I had a partner!
I would have taken a bullet for him!


742
0:52:6,456 --> 0:52:9,526
You, I'm having a hard time
not shooting!


743
0:52:9,526 --> 0:52:12,896
All right, hold on! Now, that's it.
Now I'm upset.


744
0:52:12,896 --> 0:52:16,233
You try to leave, I'm-a put
your ass under citizen's arrest.


745
0:52:16,233 --> 0:52:19,336
Okay? And you and I both
know you are in direct violation


746
0:52:19,336 --> 0:52:21,505
of a legal, binding
restraining order.


747
0:52:21,505 --> 0:52:27,21
- You have something in your teeth.
- Where? Here, or here?


748
0:52:27,21 --> 0:52:47,831
Now you can tell people
I hit you.


749
0:52:47,831 --> 0:52:50,279
- Hi.
- Hi, '78 Plymouth Volare, tan.


750
0:52:50,279 --> 0:53:2,679
- Can I have your driver's license?
- Yep.


751
0:53:2,679 --> 0:53:5,315
You... Are you kiddin' me?


752
0:53:5,315 --> 0:53:7,58
I got somethin'
in my teeth?


753
0:53:7,58 --> 0:53:10,554
I'll tell you what it was, Hank.
Trust. And now it's gone.


754
0:53:10,554 --> 0:53:13,223
Earl, what do I have
to do, huh?


755
0:53:13,223 --> 0:53:15,742
Hey, I just came here
to get Earl Jr. Okay?


756
0:53:15,742 --> 0:53:17,601
I don't go nowhere
without my baby.


757
0:53:17,601 --> 0:53:20,797
So why don't you get your jalopy,
and we both go our separate ways.


758
0:53:20,797 --> 0:53:22,506
Hey, that's my car
right over there.


759
0:53:22,506 --> 0:53:24,219
Do you think I could
just have the keys and...?


760
0:53:24,219 --> 0:53:26,903
We're just trying to locate
your paperwork, sir.


761
0:53:26,903 --> 0:53:30,64
Lookie, lookie, lookie.
What do we have here?


762
0:53:30,64 --> 0:53:33,9
How you doin', Miss Doll?


763
0:53:33,9 --> 0:53:37,447
- Fine.
- Oh, yes, you are.


764
0:53:37,447 --> 0:53:39,583
You got a pair of handcuffs
on you I can borrow?


765
0:53:39,583 --> 0:53:42,786
- You hittin' on her?
- Uh, yeah.


766
0:53:42,786 --> 0:53:46,783
What was all that crap
about interracial... couples?


767
0:53:46,783 --> 0:53:56,533
Oh. I am firmly and belligerently
against any interracial coupling...


768
0:53:56,533 --> 0:54:1,471
when the man is white.


769
0:54:1,471 --> 0:54:7,677
Darlin'... can I interest you
in a stick o' gum?


770
0:54:7,677 --> 0:54:13,183
You know, they say five outta five
dentists recommend this shit.


771
0:54:13,183 --> 0:54:14,851
Thanks.


772
0:54:14,851 --> 0:54:28,164
Get your stuff outta my car
and get the hell outta here!


773
0:54:28,164 --> 0:54:32,102
Miss Darling, what do I have
to do to get my car outta here?!


774
0:54:32,102 --> 0:54:38,441
Would you please
just be patient?


775
0:54:38,441 --> 0:54:45,548
Patient.


776
0:54:45,548 --> 0:54:50,186
- Freeze!
- On the ground, now!


777
0:54:50,186 --> 0:54:58,61
Goddamn it. God.


778
0:54:58,61 --> 0:55:0,864
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I gave up!


779
0:55:0,864 --> 0:55:2,699
Yeah, yeah, yeah!


780
0:55:2,699 --> 0:55:6,87
No, don't give up. Get in.


781
0:55:6,87 --> 0:55:15,145
- Hank, freeze!
- Get in the back.


782
0:55:15,145 --> 0:55:18,281
- Know what I'm doin'?
- Stealing a police car.


783
0:55:18,281 --> 0:55:23,753
I'm saving your ass, yet again,
despite the fact that you struck me


784
0:55:23,753 --> 0:55:27,357
- yet again.
- Okay. Sorry. Thank you.


785
0:55:27,357 --> 0:55:29,59
God!


786
0:55:29,59 --> 0:55:33,63
- Apology accepted.
- Okay, we're even. Go, go, go!


787
0:55:33,63 --> 0:55:39,836
- Don't hit me no damn more.
- Go, go, go!


788
0:55:39,836 --> 0:55:45,8
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Car!


789
0:55:45,8 --> 0:55:47,143
Forklift.
Forklift, my side.


790
0:55:47,143 --> 0:55:48,778
Forklift!


791
0:55:48,778 --> 0:55:50,88
I got it!


792
0:55:50,88 --> 0:56:4,494
- Yep... you got it.
- Watch out!


793
0:56:4,494 --> 0:56:6,229
Dead end!
Dead end, dead end!


794
0:56:6,229 --> 0:56:17,874
- Hey!
- I see it.


795
0:56:17,874 --> 0:56:22,78
Come to think of it,
you hit me and I didn't kill you?


796
0:56:22,78 --> 0:56:25,14
I'm lettin' you live,
savin' your ass...


797
0:56:25,14 --> 0:56:27,35
- Oh, I'm going straight to heaven.
- Fence!


798
0:56:27,35 --> 0:56:40,96
Chill, Hank. I'm blessed.


799
0:56:40,96 --> 0:56:41,964
What'd you do
this time, Hank?


800
0:56:41,964 --> 0:56:43,87
I don't know.
I'll find out.


801
0:56:43,87 --> 0:56:47,27
You know, for a cop, you sure
get in a hell of a lot of trouble.


802
0:56:47,27 --> 0:56:50,6
Yeah, yeah.


803
0:56:50,6 --> 0:56:55,912
Turn. Turn, turn, turn!


804
0:56:55,912 --> 0:56:58,515
Hey, chopper.
Turn here, turn here!


805
0:56:58,515 --> 0:57:5,555
Turn!


806
0:57:5,555 --> 0:57:7,991
Always loved
the car wash, man.


807
0:57:7,991 --> 0:57:13,73
White, foamy water over you...
Brushes waving in the breeze...


808
0:57:13,73 --> 0:57:17,5
When you a kid in the ghetto,
that's like goin' to Hawaii.


809
0:57:17,5 --> 0:57:21,337
- Hey, they got an APB out on both of us.
- Both of us? What the hell did I do?


810
0:57:21,337 --> 0:57:24,674
Well, we're both wanted for the shootout
on the Vincent Thomas Bridge.


811
0:57:24,674 --> 0:57:27,777
- Yeah, well, that's fair.
- No, it doesn't make any sense.


812
0:57:27,777 --> 0:57:30,447
I mean, how'd the cops know
we were on the bridge?


813
0:57:30,447 --> 0:57:32,796
The only people who could have ID'd us
were the guys in the truck,


814
0:57:32,796 --> 0:57:34,35
none of them called it in.


815
0:57:34,35 --> 0:57:38,855
Maybe someone on the inside
put out a APB to locate us.


816
0:57:38,855 --> 0:57:43,693
Now we're talking
about dirty cops.


817
0:57:43,693 --> 0:57:48,198
- What you doin'?
- Runnin' the numbers on the van.


818
0:57:48,198 --> 0:57:50,679
No, plates are phony.
Damn it!


819
0:57:50,679 --> 0:57:52,769
- Check the VAN.
- What?


820
0:57:52,769 --> 0:57:55,772
- I thought they were all scratched off.
- Not underneath.


821
0:57:55,772 --> 0:57:59,976
I pulled it when
I was wirin' the van.


822
0:57:59,976 --> 0:58:3,379
<i>- All units, 5-0-3, stolen police vehicle.
- Bingo. Address. Okay.</i>


823
0:58:3,379 --> 0:58:6,249
<i>- Car wash at Venice and Crenshaw.
- They tracked us.</i>


824
0:58:6,249 --> 0:58:17,494
Let's ditch the car!


825
0:58:17,494 --> 0:58:20,83
- We need a car.
- Yeah, yeah.


826
0:58:20,83 --> 0:58:23,233
Hey, hey! Hey, hey!


827
0:58:23,233 --> 0:58:26,669
Hey, could you pull over here?


828
0:58:26,669 --> 0:58:28,37
- God!
- Use the badge.


829
0:58:28,37 --> 0:58:29,284
- What?
- Use the badge.


830
0:58:29,284 --> 0:58:30,974
Yeah.


831
0:58:30,974 --> 0:58:35,311
Stop! National Security!


832
0:58:35,311 --> 0:58:38,14
- I'm commandeering this vehicle!
- Lemme see that badge.


833
0:58:38,14 --> 0:58:42,51
- Right, just step out of the car, ma'am.
- Don't you raise your voice at me.


834
0:58:42,51 --> 0:58:43,82
Get out of the damn car!


835
0:58:43,82 --> 0:58:45,989
Didn't your mama
teach you any manners?


836
0:58:45,989 --> 0:58:52,929
At least you could
ask me nicely.


837
0:58:52,929 --> 0:58:55,714
You call this
commandeering a car?


838
0:58:55,714 --> 0:58:59,569
- You wanna shut the hell up?
- Don't be using that language in my car.


839
0:58:59,569 --> 0:59:2,138
Sorry.


840
0:59:2,138 --> 0:59:4,841
Now, I got no problem
giving you boys a ride.


841
0:59:4,841 --> 0:59:7,877
But I don't take kindly to
being told to get outta my car.


842
0:59:7,877 --> 0:59:11,247
No, sir.
I surely do not.


843
0:59:11,247 --> 0:59:14,984
Warrant.
A warrant.


844
0:59:14,984 --> 0:59:17,887
Look, they must've had
a warrant to raid the warehouse.


845
0:59:17,887 --> 0:59:21,561
The dirty cop had to have access
to it to send his boys in first.


846
0:59:21,561 --> 0:59:23,993
Same thing must've happened
at the storage place.


847
0:59:23,993 --> 0:59:26,129
- So who's the leak?
- I don't know.


848
0:59:26,129 --> 0:59:29,65
APB's go through
watch commander.


849
0:59:29,65 --> 0:59:31,734
Washington?
Ain't that how it always is?


850
0:59:31,734 --> 0:59:34,27
- What?
- You have absolutely nothin' to go on,


851
0:59:34,27 --> 0:59:36,306
and already
you blaming the black man.


852
0:59:36,306 --> 0:59:40,832
- I'm just throwing names out.
- I'll tell you how to find a dirty cop.


853
0:59:40,832 --> 0:59:43,146
Pick up the phone
and call the police station.


854
0:59:43,146 --> 0:59:58,928
Don't really matter
who answers.


855
0:59:58,928 --> 1:0:0,43
What you gonna say?


856
1:0:0,43 --> 1:0:1,965
- Thanks.
- Thank you.


857
1:0:1,965 --> 1:0:6,869
- Okay, you boys behave now.
- No question.


858
1:0:6,869 --> 1:0:10,373
- Take care.
- Should I have gotten her number?


859
1:0:10,373 --> 1:0:15,712
- Definitely. She's very nice.
- I thought so too.


860
1:0:15,712 --> 1:0:17,88
Is this the place?


861
1:0:17,88 --> 1:0:22,251
Stay cool.


862
1:0:22,251 --> 1:0:24,253
Can you pick this?


863
1:0:24,253 --> 1:0:29,926
What? "Just because I'm
a black man... What?"


864
1:0:29,926 --> 1:0:32,929
You were doin' good.
But why you said like this:


865
1:0:32,929 --> 1:0:36,466
All black people don't do that.
Look, man, just let it flow...


866
1:0:36,466 --> 1:0:39,202
Can you
pick the lock or not?


867
1:0:39,202 --> 1:0:45,375
- Not without my tools.
- Hey, hey. Come on.


868
1:0:45,375 --> 1:0:49,512
This is great.
A real stakeout.


869
1:0:49,512 --> 1:0:51,981
My whole life, man,
I wanted to be a cop.


870
1:0:51,981 --> 1:0:54,851
Ever since I was a kid,
watching "Quincy" on TV.


871
1:0:54,851 --> 1:0:57,2
Quincy was a medical examiner.


872
1:0:57,2 --> 1:1:5,361
Oh. I guess in the projects
we didn't get real good reception.


873
1:1:5,361 --> 1:1:12,935
Hey, man. This is boring.
How long we been here?


874
1:1:12,935 --> 1:1:17,507
- Comin' up on 12 minutes.
- Where the hell are these people?


875
1:1:17,507 --> 1:1:21,411
Earl, this is a stakeout.
We could be sitting here for hours.


876
1:1:21,411 --> 1:1:26,34
No wonder cops are so fat.


877
1:1:26,34 --> 1:1:28,518
Ah, shoot.


878
1:1:28,518 --> 1:1:35,892
Hey, whatever happened
to Charlie?


879
1:1:35,892 --> 1:1:40,363
If you don't mind, I'd just ra...
I'd rather... not talk about it.


880
1:1:40,363 --> 1:1:43,477
You sure?


881
1:1:43,477 --> 1:1:51,607
Yeah.


882
1:1:51,607 --> 1:2:1,17
You know, they shot him
right in front of me, man.


883
1:2:1,17 --> 1:2:7,19
I couldn't do
a damn thing about it.


884
1:2:7,19 --> 1:2:11,661
I'm sorry to hear that, man.
Who did it?


885
1:2:11,661 --> 1:2:17,33
The guys we're looking for.


886
1:2:17,33 --> 1:2:20,47
So that's why
this is personal.


887
1:2:20,47 --> 1:2:24,373
Let me get this straight.
Your partner got killed...


888
1:2:24,373 --> 1:2:30,179
you lost your job, you got thrown
in jail, your girlfriend walked...


889
1:2:30,179 --> 1:2:36,222
and now you're a security guard
making 182 dollars a week?


890
1:2:36,222 --> 1:2:44,16
Know what you are, Hank?
You're a black man.


891
1:2:44,16 --> 1:2:49,31
Now, though, you gotta
think about it, though, right?


892
1:2:49,31 --> 1:2:52,935
Glad to see you laugh,
man.


893
1:2:52,935 --> 1:2:56,873
- Now, how long we been here?
- Oh, come on.


894
1:2:56,873 --> 1:3:25,635
- Coming up on 13 minutes.
- I got to get somethin' to eat, man.


895
1:3:25,635 --> 1:3:27,69
Earl.


896
1:3:27,69 --> 1:3:33,9
Hey! Earl.


897
1:3:33,9 --> 1:3:37,547
What are you doing?


898
1:3:37,547 --> 1:3:45,822
No! Earl!


899
1:3:45,822 --> 1:3:52,161
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.


900
1:3:52,161 --> 1:4:8,744
Earl, hey. Earl.


901
1:4:8,744 --> 1:4:14,15
We're always early.
He's always late.


902
1:4:14,15 --> 1:4:20,723
Damn it!


903
1:4:20,723 --> 1:4:26,796
<i>Call me back. They were spotted
at the police impound yard. </i>


904
1:4:26,796 --> 1:4:36,739
Get down and
get the goods. 


905
1:4:36,739 --> 1:5:9,405
Pain in the ass!


906
1:5:9,405 --> 1:5:10,573
Are you okay?


907
1:5:10,573 --> 1:5:15,77
Hell, no, I ain't okay, man.
I been shot!


908
1:5:15,77 --> 1:5:18,14
Shit.


909
1:5:18,14 --> 1:5:19,982
- It's him!
- How do you know?


910
1:5:19,982 --> 1:5:23,853
Tattoo!


911
1:5:23,853 --> 1:5:29,525
- Son of a bitch!
- Partner.


912
1:5:29,525 --> 1:5:49,312
Go get 'im.


913
1:5:49,312 --> 1:5:51,614
- Hank.
- Yeah?


914
1:5:51,614 --> 1:5:54,517
You get 'im?


915
1:5:54,517 --> 1:5:57,42
No.


916
1:5:57,42 --> 1:6:0,523
- Come on.
- I ain't gonna make it, Hank.


917
1:6:0,523 --> 1:6:5,394
I'm cold, man.
I'm cold all over.


918
1:6:5,394 --> 1:6:8,64
I'm startin' to see
white light.


919
1:6:8,64 --> 1:6:11,233
Ah, damn.
Even the light is white.


920
1:6:11,233 --> 1:6:14,837
Come on. You hit
in the leg, Sally. Let's go!


921
1:6:14,837 --> 1:6:18,7
- Don't bounce. Don't bounce!
- You gotta help me a little.


922
1:6:18,7 --> 1:6:24,246
- You're bouncing!
- Your other leg.


923
1:6:24,246 --> 1:6:29,372
Denise! Denise!
It's Hank. Hank.


924
1:6:29,372 --> 1:6:31,821
- I thought I told you. It's over.
- I been shot!


925
1:6:31,821 --> 1:6:33,489
You shot him now?


926
1:6:33,489 --> 1:6:34,824
- No.
- What happened?


927
1:6:34,824 --> 1:6:37,93
Look, it's a long story,
but... you gotta trust us.


928
1:6:37,93 --> 1:6:38,535
We didn't do anything
wrong or illegal.


929
1:6:38,535 --> 1:6:39,762
Then take him to a hospital.


930
1:6:39,762 --> 1:6:42,965
No, no! We can't, cause
the cops are looking for us.


931
1:6:42,965 --> 1:6:45,34
- What?
- It's complicated!


932
1:6:45,34 --> 1:6:47,336
Look, Denise, I understand
you're a nurse, right?


933
1:6:47,336 --> 1:6:50,206
I'm bleeding out here.
Now, y'all can bicker later. Come on.


934
1:6:50,206 --> 1:6:52,808
- Please, please.
- Let me come in?


935
1:6:52,808 --> 1:6:55,177
- All right.
- Yeah, go.


936
1:6:55,177 --> 1:7:0,216
- Hey.
- Sorry.


937
1:7:0,216 --> 1:7:1,851
- Take off your pants.
- Huh?


938
1:7:1,851 --> 1:7:7,39
Take off your pants.


939
1:7:7,39 --> 1:7:10,659
Earl? You're not wearing
any underwear.


940
1:7:10,659 --> 1:7:14,63
I don't like to wear drawers, okay?
Makes me feel constricted.


941
1:7:14,63 --> 1:7:17,333
So does dying. Now, hurry up,
Hank! Come on!


942
1:7:17,333 --> 1:7:20,403
- I'll get you a towel.
- Better make it a beach towel.


943
1:7:20,403 --> 1:7:23,406
- It's not that big.
- It ain't small.


944
1:7:23,406 --> 1:7:28,577
Thank you, Denise.
That was very sweet of you.


945
1:7:28,577 --> 1:7:31,814
All right, I'm gonna need you
to keep pressure on the wound.


946
1:7:31,814 --> 1:7:35,284
Right. Okay, bend over the chair
and hike up the towel.


947
1:7:35,284 --> 1:7:38,687
- What? I'm not like that, man!
- Do it!


948
1:7:38,687 --> 1:7:41,357
Oh, oh. Well,
just say that, Hank.


949
1:7:41,357 --> 1:7:44,56
Thought you was trying
to get a free ass shot.


950
1:7:44,56 --> 1:7:46,829
Come on, Denise, now. Come on,
tell me the truth.


951
1:7:46,829 --> 1:7:49,598
Earl, there's no bullet in you.


952
1:7:49,598 --> 1:7:52,268
It went through... through
the bone, out the other side?


953
1:7:52,268 --> 1:7:56,639
It barely touched you.
It's a scratch.


954
1:7:56,639 --> 1:7:58,59
Denise, you think
I'm gonna need stitches?


955
1:7:58,59 --> 1:8:3,312
- Yes.
- I knew it.


956
1:8:3,312 --> 1:8:8,484
- Well, just...
- Oh! Whoa. You know what?


957
1:8:8,484 --> 1:8:10,519
- What?
- I'll let it heal naturally.


958
1:8:10,519 --> 1:8:13,923
- Oh...
- Yeah, yeah, that's right.


959
1:8:13,923 --> 1:8:15,724
Oh, no!


960
1:8:15,724 --> 1:8:17,259
- It's a bee...
- Calm down!


961
1:8:17,259 --> 1:8:20,262
- A bumblebee! No!
- Don't move. Don't move!


962
1:8:20,262 --> 1:8:25,334
Death from above!
No! Swish it out.


963
1:8:25,334 --> 1:8:32,875
Death from above, man.


964
1:8:32,875 --> 1:8:37,88
- Is it safe?
- Not for you, it ain't!


965
1:8:37,88 --> 1:8:40,583
I can't believe your girl
can go off like that.


966
1:8:40,583 --> 1:8:44,653
- She hits harder than you do.
- Yeah, this is it.


967
1:8:44,653 --> 1:8:47,623
Marina Yacht Club.
This is where the call came from.


968
1:8:47,623 --> 1:9:2,505
How we gonna get in?


969
1:9:2,505 --> 1:9:11,213
- Split up.
- Excuse me, I want the big fat one.


970
1:9:11,213 --> 1:9:13,749
Oh, that looks interesting.
What is it?


971
1:9:13,749 --> 1:9:22,258
I don't know,
but it smells like ass.


972
1:9:22,258 --> 1:9:24,306
You recognize anyone?


973
1:9:24,306 --> 1:9:28,264
Man, it's so damn white in here,
my pupils haven't adjusted yet.


974
1:9:28,264 --> 1:9:31,4
Hey. Hey, look.


975
1:9:31,4 --> 1:9:41,944
- That's him.
- Son of a bitch.


976
1:9:41,944 --> 1:9:45,214
What do you know?
It's the white guy.


977
1:9:45,214 --> 1:10:9,138
A sad day
in Caucasian history.


978
1:10:9,138 --> 1:10:17,379
- Where the hell the two of you been?
- Jimmy Buffet's in town. Come on.


979
1:10:17,379 --> 1:10:19,682
You got five minutes.
It better be good.


980
1:10:19,682 --> 1:10:21,517
- Can I get a chip?
- No.


981
1:10:21,517 --> 1:10:23,752
You got a leak
and we know who it is.


982
1:10:23,752 --> 1:10:26,188
- Now can I get a chip?
- No.


983
1:10:26,188 --> 1:10:29,491
It's McDuff.


984
1:10:29,491 --> 1:10:32,127
- I assume you have some proof.
- Yeah.


985
1:10:32,127 --> 1:10:34,83
We been trackin' them knuckleheads
who hit my warehouse.


986
1:10:34,83 --> 1:10:38,1
- The same guys who killed Charlie.
- Led us right to McDuff.


987
1:10:38,1 --> 1:10:41,144
That's all very interesting,
but do you have actual evidence?


988
1:10:41,144 --> 1:10:43,962
- No.
- No. But we got what he wants.


989
1:10:43,962 --> 1:10:46,809
- What is that?
- The goods from the CIA heist.


990
1:10:46,809 --> 1:10:51,78
- You got the CIA goods?
- Wait a minute. It was really CIA?


991
1:10:51,78 --> 1:10:54,717
Crupps International Aerospace?


992
1:10:54,717 --> 1:10:57,786
What CIA did you think
I was talking about?


993
1:10:57,786 --> 1:10:59,755
Would you tell 'im,
please?


994
1:10:59,755 --> 1:11:1,929
A year ago,
over 7 million dollars


995
1:11:1,929 --> 1:11:6,187
in iovian coded atomic alloy
was stolen out of Crupps.


996
1:11:6,187 --> 1:11:7,453
And to smuggle it
out of the country,


997
1:11:7,453 --> 1:11:10,385
they had to melt it down
and recast it as beer kegs.


998
1:11:10,385 --> 1:11:13,2
Feds tipped us off.
Our leak beat us to the punch.


999
1:11:13,2 --> 1:11:17,539
That's right. McDuff. Offer to sell 'im
back his stuff. Oh, he'll bite.


1000
1:11:17,539 --> 1:11:20,542
- If he's dirty.
- Oh, he's dirty.


1001
1:11:20,542 --> 1:11:32,454
Now,
give the man a chip.


1002
1:11:32,454 --> 1:11:35,124
I appreciate you tryin'
to get me a chip.


1003
1:11:35,124 --> 1:11:38,794
But thinkin' that I was
talkin' about the actual CIA...


1004
1:11:38,794 --> 1:11:41,363
Yeah. I don't know
what I was thinking.


1005
1:11:41,363 --> 1:11:44,933
Hey, McDuff.
It's your buddies, Hank and Earl.


1006
1:11:44,933 --> 1:11:46,221
What's up, Duff?


1007
1:11:46,221 --> 1:11:48,19
Look, uh, we get
somethin' that you want.


1008
1:11:48,19 --> 1:11:50,506
<i>I don't know what
you're talking about. </i>


1009
1:11:50,506 --> 1:11:53,509
We're talking
beer kegs, bitch!


1010
1:11:53,509 --> 1:11:55,52
<i>You two
are wanted felons.</i>


1011
1:11:55,52 --> 1:11:57,218
Look, Frank, save it.
We know you're dirty.


1012
1:11:57,218 --> 1:11:59,505
<i>- Listen to me...
- No, you listen to me.</i>


1013
1:11:59,505 --> 1:12:1,307
Look, I don't know who
you're selling these things to.


1014
1:12:1,307 --> 1:12:2,393
I don't really care.


1015
1:12:2,393 --> 1:12:6,695
All we want is a piece of the pie.
Say, uh, 1 million dollars worth.


1016
1:12:6,695 --> 1:12:10,159
<i>- We're talking six zeros, chump.
- So, what's your plan? </i>


1017
1:12:10,159 --> 1:12:34,516
Meet us tomorrow morning, 7 a.m.
Uh, the old fort, Luna Point.


1018
1:12:34,516 --> 1:12:36,651
How'd you
find this place?


1019
1:12:36,651 --> 1:12:41,69
Uhh, I did a couple nights of security
watching some... construction equipment.


1020
1:12:41,69 --> 1:12:45,427
- It's perfect for us, though.
- How many boys Washington got?


1021
1:12:45,427 --> 1:12:58,874
I don't know. Uh...
I see... five or so.


1022
1:12:58,874 --> 1:13:7,249
- I'm startin' to feel all tingly and shit.
- Yeah.


1023
1:13:7,249 --> 1:13:13,789
I thought I shot you once already.
You're a tough little monkey, aren't you?


1024
1:13:13,789 --> 1:13:16,58
You into monkey jokes, right?


1025
1:13:16,58 --> 1:13:17,474
Didn't your mama
teach you some manners


1026
1:13:17,474 --> 1:13:20,195
when you were humpin' 'er?


1027
1:13:20,195 --> 1:13:23,766
- Did you bring the metal, Hank?
- You bring the money, Frank?


1028
1:13:23,766 --> 1:13:26,1
We'll see about that
when I see the kegs.


1029
1:13:26,1 --> 1:13:27,52
You know what? Let's just
forget about the money.


1030
1:13:27,52 --> 1:13:37,446
I think we already got
what we came for.


1031
1:13:37,446 --> 1:13:42,217
I don't think you'll find them
as helpful as you thought they'd be.


1032
1:13:42,217 --> 1:13:46,54
You see, my men aren't actually
members of the L.A. SWAT team.


1033
1:13:46,54 --> 1:13:48,23
- Where's Washington?
- I don't know.


1034
1:13:48,23 --> 1:13:56,598
Excellent question.


1035
1:13:56,598 --> 1:13:59,201
- Shit.
- Oh, man.


1036
1:13:59,201 --> 1:14:1,837
The brother's in on it?


1037
1:14:1,837 --> 1:14:4,74
He must've grew up
in a white neighborhood.


1038
1:14:4,74 --> 1:14:7,91
Gun. Scratch that.


1039
1:14:7,91 --> 1:14:11,713
He's a real brother, gettin'
messed over just like the rest of us.


1040
1:14:11,713 --> 1:14:20,422
Guns, gentlemen.


1041
1:14:20,422 --> 1:14:22,391
Look, I... No. Look!


1042
1:14:22,391 --> 1:14:38,574
Sorry. No, no. Look, look.
No, no, no, no! Go!


1043
1:14:38,574 --> 1:14:46,482
Washington,
get over here!


1044
1:14:46,482 --> 1:14:49,485
Get in! Get in! Get in!


1045
1:14:49,485 --> 1:14:53,622
I know a way out!


1046
1:14:53,622 --> 1:14:56,191
There's a tunnel
at the other end.


1047
1:14:56,191 --> 1:14:59,127
Down! Down!
What the hell happened?


1048
1:14:59,127 --> 1:15:2,164
I don't know.
They grabbed me after we talked.


1049
1:15:2,164 --> 1:15:12,4
Take a right! Come on!


1050
1:15:12,4 --> 1:15:29,758
Get through the other end!


1051
1:15:29,758 --> 1:15:33,762
Earl!


1052
1:15:33,762 --> 1:15:38,667
Come on! The tunnel!


1053
1:15:38,667 --> 1:15:47,876
Go, go!


1054
1:15:47,876 --> 1:16:8,96
Hank, come on!


1055
1:16:8,96 --> 1:16:10,432
Earl.


1056
1:16:10,432 --> 1:16:13,302
What? Where's Hank?


1057
1:16:13,302 --> 1:16:16,471
- I don't know.
- Hank!


1058
1:16:16,471 --> 1:16:20,375
Hank! Shit.
I gotta go find him.


1059
1:16:20,375 --> 1:16:26,715
- Okay, go ahead. My foot's busted up.
- You gonna be okay?


1060
1:16:26,715 --> 1:17:11,56
I'll be fine. Go!


1061
1:17:11,56 --> 1:17:25,34
Damn it!


1062
1:17:25,34 --> 1:17:29,244
Earl!


1063
1:17:29,244 --> 1:17:38,987
No!


1064
1:17:38,987 --> 1:17:54,336
Busted!


1065
1:17:54,336 --> 1:18:23,765
Son of a bitch.


1066
1:18:23,765 --> 1:18:53,962
Yeah!


1067
1:18:53,962 --> 1:19:4,172
Hey, Nash! Catch!


1068
1:19:4,172 --> 1:19:7,809
Yeah!


1069
1:19:7,809 --> 1:19:14,95
Who's a monkey now?
Monkey!


1070
1:19:14,95 --> 1:19:24,292
- Ah, shit. Hank!
- Hold on!


1071
1:19:24,292 --> 1:19:31,199
Whoops! Sorry!


1072
1:19:31,199 --> 1:19:35,303
- Hank!
- Hold on!


1073
1:19:35,303 --> 1:19:49,751
Good, good, good, good!


1074
1:19:49,751 --> 1:19:53,955
Whoa!


1075
1:19:53,955 --> 1:19:58,827
- Yes!
- Yeah!


1076
1:19:58,827 --> 1:20:3,331
- You the man!
- No, you are the man!


1077
1:20:3,331 --> 1:20:8,97
- You the man!
- Okay, I am the man!


1078
1:20:8,97 --> 1:20:13,475
Yeah, yeah!


1079
1:20:13,475 --> 1:20:16,344
Six months ago,
these two men were locked


1080
1:20:16,344 --> 1:20:18,847
in a conflict
that shook our city. 


1081
1:20:18,847 --> 1:20:21,65
Today they stand together
as heroes. 


1082
1:20:21,65 --> 1:20:27,189
Gentlemen, thank you for your
bravery and your selflessness.


1083
1:20:27,189 --> 1:20:38,567
Hank, welcome back
to the force.


1084
1:20:38,567 --> 1:20:43,939
Thanks.


1085
1:20:43,939 --> 1:20:52,347
- Earl, welcome to the L.A.P.D.
- You serious?


1086
1:20:52,347 --> 1:21:5,126
- Congratulations, Earl.
- Yeah. Thank you.


1087
1:21:5,126 --> 1:21:12,334
- Earl! That's enough.
- Oh.


1088
1:21:12,334 --> 1:21:15,7
Hey, check it out,
10:00 o'clock.


1089
1:21:15,7 --> 1:21:20,208
Pull over.


1090
1:21:20,208 --> 1:21:21,592
Excuse me.


1091
1:21:21,592 --> 1:21:23,712
Hey, uh, you wanna step away
from the vehicle, please?


1092
1:21:23,712 --> 1:21:25,914
Hank. Please, man.


1093
1:21:25,914 --> 1:21:30,85
Lemme show you how this type
of situation is properly handled.


1094
1:21:30,85 --> 1:21:32,854
Excuse me, Mr. Civilian,
who has rights.


1095
1:21:32,854 --> 1:21:35,457
Did you perhaps lock your keys
in your vehicle?


1096
1:21:35,457 --> 1:21:38,56
Yeah, I do it all the time.
They're right there in the visor.


1097
1:21:38,56 --> 1:21:43,465
Yeah, yeah.
Right there in the visor.


1098
1:21:43,465 --> 1:21:45,433
Well, for my partner's
peace of mind,


1099
1:21:45,433 --> 1:21:48,3
would you tell us
the numbers on your license plate?


1100
1:21:48,3 --> 1:21:53,608
- Sure, 2CQN654.
- Is he right?


1101
1:21:53,608 --> 1:21:56,278
Yeah.


1102
1:21:56,278 --> 1:21:58,146
Allow me to assist you,


1103
1:21:58,146 --> 1:22:5,12
instead of beat you senseless,
like some cops would.


1104
1:22:5,12 --> 1:22:7,289
- Thank you, officer
- You're very welcome.


1105
1:22:7,289 --> 1:22:9,824
- Have a good day, all right?
- I will. Thanks.


1106
1:22:9,824 --> 1:22:12,394
Hey, listen, man. Not everyone's
a criminal. Remember that.


1107
1:22:12,394 --> 1:22:15,43
My car! No, wait!
That's my car!


1108
1:22:15,43 --> 1:22:25,674
Course, it's always good
to have a backup plan.


1109
1:22:25,674 --> 1:22:28,71
I give up!


1110
1:22:28,71 --> 1:22:37,585
Ma'am, you may re-procure
your vehicle.


1111
1:22:37,585 --> 1:22:44,225
You idiot!


1112
1:22:44,225 --> 1:24:44,225
What the problem is?
