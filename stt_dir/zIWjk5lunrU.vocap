###1816 I told Patty the score, she threw down the gauntlet.
###1820 This is war.
###1822 So much for peace and goodwill, eh?
###1825 Me and my Brendan was involved in an explosion once. 1972.
###1829 We were on a cruise, celebrating us anniversary.
###1833 Having dinner at the Captains' table,
###1835 when suddenly, this God almighty bang...
###1837 and the ship tipped. Felt it... wham.
###1841 And within an hour, the whole vessel were upside down.
###1844 We were trapped.
###1849 That was the Poseidon Adventure.
###1852 Did it not happen?
###1855 So we're just going to sit here, let 'em get away with it?
###1858 Would you be doing this if I'd have been blown to fuckin' pieces?
###1862 No.
###1863 So what do we do?
###1865 Go round there and we nail them.
###1866 What? You mean kill them? Kill Jesus?
###1869 Kill 'em all.
###1870 We tried the gentle approach,
###1872 and they wouldn't listen.
###1874 Your answer to everything that, isn't it?
###1876 What do you suggest?
###1877 I dunno. Anything but that.
###1880 It's just wrong.
###1881 It's all wrong.
###1883 This time tomorrow, our problem will no longer be our problem.
###1897 Kel, Kel! Are you OK? He didn't hit you?
###1900 He wouldn't fucking dare.
###1902 Don't come round again, Marty.
###1909 Why?
###1911 He'll kill you.
###1912 I can't just stop seeing you.
###1914 You're going to have to.
###1914 I can't!
###1915 Why the fuck not?
###1917 Because I love ya.
###1926 I love ya!
###1935 You sure you're OK?
###1936 Fine, thanks, Auntie.
###1938 If you're agreeable, you could stay with us.
###1941 Come with us. Join our Crusade.
###1945 You mean it?
###1948 Indeed we do.
###1953 Where's Grace?
###1954 Upstairs, having a lie down.
###1957 I'm off on a few messages.
###1961 If you need anything, just call for Jesus.
###1964 I'll be in the office.
###1968 THUNDER
###1986 What you doing?
###1988 What's it look like?
###2010 It's upside down.
###2015 Hey. Jesus?
###2036 If you hadn't dragged my husband off,
###2039 he'd have killed that poor bastard and be looking at a life stretch.
###2042 So I owe you.
###2043 My lot have had enough
###2045 and they plan to make sure you don't cause no more problems.
###2047 When they realise we pose no threat...
###2050 Look, Jesus...
###2051 What's your real name? I can't keep calling you that.
###2054 That is my real name.
###2056 What did your mam call you?
###2059 Fuck's sake, I'm trying to have a serious conversation.
###2067 Eric.
###2068 Eric.
###2071 Eric.
###2073 Some folk respond well to kindness, a soft touch.
###2078 Jamie isn't the type of man you want to be messing with.
###2080 When the Romans came for Christ...
###2083 You want to finish up in the foundations for a flyover...
###2085 Sit tight.
###2091 There's something I don't understand.
###2093 You're a...
###2097 good looking bloke.
###2098 Kind, considerate, passionate.
###2102 Your love for God tells me that much.
###2105 You never been tempted?
###2106 You never been tempted?
###2107 I pray to God to keep me pure.
###2109 You never longed for that touch?
###2111 That euphoria.
###2114 Him.
###2116 His need.
###2117 My need.
###2120 When we make love...
###2123 I could almost believe in God.
###2126 It's that good.
###2127 It's that good.
###2132 Don't be here.
###2133 They're coming.
###2139 See ya.
###2140 Bye.
###2144 Nice shoes, Grace.
###2150 You'd better go.
###2187 Arghh! What?!
###2189 Have you heard from Libby?
###2191 I'm the last one she'd get in touch with!
###2193 Where is she?
###2194 I don't know!
###2199 Why are you so intent on seeing her anyway?
###2204 She didn't say where she was going,
###2206 or who she was going with?
###2207 Why would she tell me?
###2209 She didn't leave a note for me?
###2212 What, for her jailer?
###2213 Her tormentor?
###2215 I'm her mother.
###2216 Just because you've seen the light,
###2219 doesn't mean to say everyone else has too.
###2233 Go seek comfort in Jesus.
###2235 Not the real one, obviously.
###2237 I'm not suggesting you should top yourself,
###2239 but, you know, the himbo on the bus.
###2244 I'm sure he can rustle up a few words of comfort
###2249 from some Epistle or another.
###2250 You know, rattle his tambourine.
###2261 Fuck me.
###2263 The ice maiden melteth.
###2293 I shed a few tears for her.
###2295 Mostly of regret.
###2296 You treated her like shite.
###2299 Regret that I ever met her,
###2301 that we ever picked up where we left off,
###2304 cos truth be told, there was nothing left to pick up.
###2307 But, I got me tea made. Me washing done...
###2310 A good nosh now and again.
###2312 You bastard!
###2315 All she needed to hear was, "I love you", and she was on her knees.
###2319 I've had better sex but my shirts have never been whiter.
###2325 I wondered when the real Patty would resurface.
###2329 And here she is.
###2339 So, this is goodbye then, is it?
###2344 I can't see any reason to stay.
###2346 Where did you go when you left here?
###2348 What turned you from the godless old crone we knew
###2351 into the God-fearing crone now before us?
###2354 Much like yourself, I lived a selfish life,
###2357 attending to my needs before even considering the needs of others.
###2362 And then I went back to Ireland and, while there,
###2365 had what I can only describe as my Road To Damascus experience.
###2371 Oh, so God just popped up and showed you the error of your ways?
###2375 Yeah? Well, I don't believe a word.
###2377 I think little Patty clocked the Jesus freaks and thought,
###2380 "Bingo! Free meals and a roof over me head for the rest of me life."
###2384 I wouldn't expect you to believe.
###2386 I was a lost sheep and God saved me.
###2390 Liar.
###2391 May He strike me down here and now
###2395 if I tell a word of a lie.
###2453 Matty?
###2455 I'm going.
###2456 Good.
###2457 No. I mean, I'm leaving this.
###2459 You don't have to leave this. Just here.
###2461 My head's full of everything I've been missing.
###2464 You can have it all, you know. I think God would let you.
###2467 How can I preach purity when all I want to be is impure?
###2470 Preach goodness, when all I want to do is bad?
###2474 I'm not worthy. They deserve better than me.
###2480 What you want to do, it's normal.
###2483 It's not bad.
###2484 But I want it to be bad.
###2486 I want to bite the apple, Kelly.
###2495 Thank you.
###2534 Anyone?
###2535 Nothing.
###2553 See you got my present, then?
###2555 I won't ask where it came from.
###2557 'No, don't.'
###2558 You got my present?
###2559 I got it.
###2561 Listen, next time you're saving souls round here, come save mine.
###2566 Bye.
###2572 They say the damage to my spine is irreparable.
###2575 I'll never walk again.
###2577 You've taken it very well, I'll give you that.
###2579 I've got my life back, Frank.
###2581 What could be better?
###2582 I don't understand.
###2584 The police will be here any minute.
###2586 And what I tell them depends very much on you.
###2590 How do you mean?
###2592 Everyone on the estate knows how much you hated me.
###2595 Everyone knows how much you wanted me out the picture.
###2600 If you agree to have me move back,
###2603 then I agree not to tell the police
###2605 you pushed me down the stairs - that you did this.
###2608 Well, that's just gonna be my word against... Who's gonna believe..?
###2611 Ah! Oh, nurse!
###2613 Oh! Nurse!
###2615 Pain, oh!
###2616 Oh!
###2618 We'll have to increase your morphine.
###2620 I'm just going to check with the doctor. Hang on there, Patty.
###2623 Oh! Oh!
###2630 Wouldn't you be better off back on the bus,
###2633 amongst your own kind?
###2635 With those Bible bashing bastards? I can't stand the feckin' sight of them!
###2639 I want to be amongst folk I know.
###2641 Familiar faces, surroundings.
###2644 I want to come home.
###2645 And I wanted to make your life a feckin' misery, Frank.
###2664 'I ran into that old boyfriend a few years ago.
###2668 'I was out with the girls in town,
###2670 'turned a corner and bang, there he was.
###2672 'No longer a possible replacement for Robbie or Gary.
###2676 'His face was etched with all the wrong he'd done.
###2678 'All the pain he'd caused.'
###2680 Oh, they're here!
###2681 'And, if I believed in God,
###2683 'I'd like to think he'd had every sin that he'd ever committed
###2687 'scratched into his face as a warning to others
###2691 'to keep their distance - to beware.
###2699 'That's if I believed in God.'
###2701 What are you going on about? It's a scratch card!
###2704 (REPORTER) Tonight, a pensioner was brutally assaulted
###2707 in her home in Belvedere Road...
###2709 If it gets any clearer, I'll be topping meself.
###2713 It's Frank's name on the line.
###2715 Yeah, and his head.
###2718 Don't know how you missed him!
###2720 What the fuck?
###2721 Forensics rustled a few new words up for you, Frank.
###2724 DNA.
###2725 Positive match.
###2726 If it was you, that'd be us finished.
###2729 I need Kev! Where is he?
