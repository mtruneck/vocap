###35 HARVEY FOSTER: You have to believe in traveling.
###37 
###41 You've got to go out and do stuff.
###44 Of course I've had fun.
###45 I have fun everywhere, man.
###47 Every single spot we went to there's something to remember.
###51 Like when my bike broke down.
###54 The roughest moments you remember a lot.
###58 Well, at least my fucking bike broke down on the Baja and not
###62 in Victoria.
###64 The day before though, I knew my bike was running hard.
###69 I need that wrench.
###70 It's too loose.
###71 We rode for half an hour, people started passing me
###75 because I wanted to slow down and just enjoy it.
###78 So I got all that out of me.
###79 And fucking, the Canadians are behind me--
###82 Ky and Keegan.
###83 He pulls up beside me and I was smoking man.
###85 I was smoking.
###87 KYNAN TAIT: I don't know.
###89 He was ahead of us and we pulled over and there was just
###91 oil everywhere.
###91 He was leaking oil last night, and then it just looked it
###95 blew up today.
###96 
###100 HARVEY FOSTER: A man's always got to push his bike.
###104 That's sick, hey?
###105 That was dope.
###107 I don't know, I wanted to push my bike.
###109 I got a moment with her right now.
###110 And he knows I don't have many possessions in life except for
###115 my motorcycle.
###116 And he makes fun of me for being a free spirit-- yeah,
###119 I'll go whatever, do whatever.
###121 But I'm going to sound like a total typical Harley Davidson
###126 dude, but my bike is my life.
###129 When my bike broke down, Keegan handed me the machete.
###133 All right, cool.
###135 It's not like all my anger and all my shit is gone.
###140 But it was like, whatever, make
###141 the best of the situation.
###143 I like the way this guy thinks.
###144 
###148 Got my fucking captain right there, with me.
###152 Actually, I like that you were there a lot.
###156 I was really fucking stoked.
###159 I don't know if that's like a teary moment or something for
###162 people who don't know me and this guy.
###164 But we kind of do a lot of shit together.
###167 So when it broke down I was like, who else would I want to
###170 be beside me other than the guy I'd go
###172 across the country with?
###173 KYNAN TAIT: Good riding with you, Harvey!
###175 
###189 HARVEY FOSTER: I didn't get to do this trip.
###192 Like, I did the trip a different way.
###193 
###196 That's all I think about in the truck is like, oh man, I
###199 hope we pull over somewhere where they need gas and we can
###202 skate some.
###204 
###206 Yes!
###207 
###219 That thing was really tight.
###222 And it sucks, too, because there was like professional
###225 skateboarders there and I couldn't do it.
###227 When they could have done a really good trick.
###229 [SCREAMS]
###232 Heath and Keegan placed a bet whether I'd do it or not.
###234 Heath said no one could do it.
###236 Keegan said I could do it.
###237 So then when I heard about that, too, I was like I'm
###240 letting Canada down.
###242 Because we're used to stupid spots that are really fucking
###245 stupid to skate and we have to work to skate them.
###248 So I was kind of like fuck, I blew it there.
###251 But I don't have patience for things like that.
###253 I don't have patience at all.
###256 If I didn't do it in ten tries, I was over it.
###258 [INAUDIBLE]?
###258 No way.
###260 It was hot, that's my excuse.
###265 No, I'm over this.
###269 But, I don't know, I think the next two days are going to be
###273 a lot of fun.
###274 I can even feel it in the group, too.
###276 Because I think it's been hard on them riding a lot in hot
###283 weather, bugs, windy roads.
###286 But I think the next few days are going to be a lot of fun.
###289 This is good to think about, too.
###291 
###302 BILL BRYANT: We're coming out of Mulege.
###303 It's about 15 miles south and we rounded a
###306 corner up on a hill.
###307 And looking down onto that bay, I think everybody's
###310 stoked meter just went through the roof.
###312 That's what everybody expects from Baja.
###314 You want to see some crystal clear water, you want to see a
###317 big, white beach and hardly anybody there.
###319 And we rode down there and stripped off our clothes and
###322 ran out in the water in our underwear.
###324 I think that was an epic point of the trip, it was just fun.
###327 
###330 ARTO SAARI: Sorry about it.
###331 Floating in paradise with a beer.
###334 I'm sorry.
###336 I'm sorry.
###337 I rode a motorcycle here.
###340 HIME HERBERT: That was insane.
###341 That was like a postcard.
###343 Fuck, man, this is what I signed up for.
###349 KEEGAN SAUDER: I honestly can't think of one high point.
###353 Like, it just kind of blends in.
###354 The whole thing is pretty magical.
###356 Just the fact that we're all doing this, the whole thing is
###362 just amazing.
###363 This is like, this is living right here.
###366 This is how it should be.
###370 I know one day it's going to end, so I'm definitely trying
###372 to take full advantage of it and just appreciate the hell
###375 out of it right now.
###376
