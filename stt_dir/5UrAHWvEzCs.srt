But, still think I've got
a pretty good shot.

KEVIN SCHWANTZ: Sturla's had a
great season up to the last


203
0:12:51,5 --> 0:12:51,54
couple rounds.


204
0:12:51,54 --> 0:12:54,92
And he's made a few critical
mistakes, and given a large


205
0:12:54,92 --> 0:12:56,2
chunk of points away.


206
0:12:56,2 --> 0:12:57,99
Coming into the last round,
know that they


207
0:12:57,99 --> 0:12:59,34
Jakub Kornfeil has--


208
0:12:59,34 --> 0:13:1,28
this is home track--
he's got that home


209
0:13:1,28 --> 0:13:2,13
field advantage here.


210
0:13:2,13 --> 0:13:5,16
And with that Sturla, I'm sure
is, of the two of them,


211
0:13:5,16 --> 0:13:7,27
feeling more tension
than the other.


212
0:13:7,27 --> 0:13:13,745



213
0:13:13,745 --> 0:13:14,995
- Perfect, thanks.

GUSTL AUINGER: Everyone can get
passed during the race,


216
0:13:34,14 --> 0:13:37,65
for many do a little mistake.


217
0:13:37,65 --> 0:13:39,81
Accept this mistake.


218
0:13:39,81 --> 0:13:43,13
OK, it was a little mistake,
I don't do this anymore.


219
0:13:43,13 --> 0:13:45,2
Next lap I do it better.


220
0:13:45,2 --> 0:13:46,93
I carry on.


221
0:13:46,93 --> 0:13:50,84
I am part of the Rookie Cup.


222
0:13:50,84 --> 0:13:55,85
I am part of the team, and
I am strong enough


223
0:13:55,85 --> 0:13:58,8
to be in this team.


224
0:13:58,8 --> 0:14:0,55
It's the last weekend
for this season.


225
0:14:0,55 --> 0:14:3,77
Don't think about results
in the past,


226
0:14:3,77 --> 0:14:5,88
think about the moment.


227
0:14:5,88 --> 0:14:9,21
And take care of you
all, and I wish to


228
0:14:9,21 --> 0:14:14,97
see 27 smiling faces.

KEVIN SCHWANTZ: Going into the
file round here in Bruno, the


230
0:14:17,2 --> 0:14:20,7
excitement and the tension in
the tent is pretty amazing.


231
0:14:20,7 --> 0:14:22,7
There's certain sides, like some
of the guys are going to


232
0:14:22,7 --> 0:14:25,53
try and work together
off the front.


233
0:14:25,53 --> 0:14:28,38
And this track's big enough,
and wide enough, and fast


234
0:14:28,38 --> 0:14:30,25
enough that I think we're going
to see a pretty good


235
0:14:30,25 --> 0:14:31,9
group at the front.


236
0:14:31,9 --> 0:16:31,9
