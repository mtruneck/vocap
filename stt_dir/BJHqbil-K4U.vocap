###0 HARRY CHEADLE: There's this line that Woody Allen uses to
###3 open "Annie Hall." He says, "I'd never join a club that
###5 would have someone like me as a member." And that's how I
###7 feel about women, you know?
###9 Like if there's a beautiful girl, who's into me, a real
###11 dish, I think there's something wrong with her.
###14 That's what dating is.
###15 It's figuring out what's wrong with the other person and
###17 going into each other's neuroses.
###20 But how else are you supposed to find love?
###23 My name is Harry, and I have been a loser
###24 for most of my life.
###26 I thought I was done with my awkward phase when "Vice"
###28 hired me to write about politics, culture, and other
###30 important world affairs, which should make me
###32 cool, but it doesn't.
###34 I'm still just a weird kid who creeps people out.
###36 This is "All Around Losing with Harry Cheadle."
###45 I don't know what's wrong with me exactly.
###46 But lately--
###48 and by lately, I mean the past few years--
###50 I've been having trouble meeting women.
###51 I mean, I can meet women OK.
###53 I just have trouble going from the hi, my name is Harry
###56 stage, to the let me get a condom stage.
###59 So I'm on my way to talk to Blake Eastman, who teaches
###63 people who are afraid of other people, like me, to figure out
###66 how to date.
###68 
###70 Hey, Blake.
###71 BLAKE EASTMAN: Hey, Harry.
###71 How are you?
###71 Nice to meet you.
###72 HARRY CHEADLE: Nice to meet you.
###73 Are you ready to teach me how to use my body so I don't come
###75 off like a weirdo?
###76 BLAKE EASTMAN: Yeah.
###77 All right, let's go.
###78 HARRY CHEADLE: All right.
###79 I mean, more broadly, I just want to know how to talk to
###83 girls I've just met.
###84 I go on a lot of online dates, you know?
###86 So there's that moment, where you meet someone.
###90 And you're trying to figure out do I want to have sex with
###92 this person?
###93 Do they want to have sex with me?
###94 And, you know, I feel like they can pick up on my
###97 nervousness.
###97 BLAKE EASTMAN: I think it's an indication of anxiety for the
###100 most part, or what's called soothing gestures, or
###102 pacifying gestures, or self-rubbing.
###105 Basically, they rub themselves to calm themselves down.
###106 HARRY CHEADLE: OK.
###107 BLAKE EASTMAN: The biggest one men do on a
###108 first date is this.
###109 HARRY CHEADLE: Oh, this.
###109 BLAKE EASTMAN: I guarantee you do this.
###110 HARRY CHEADLE: This.
###111 Yeah.
###112 BLAKE EASTMAN: Do you go out on dates with anxious people?
###114 HARRY CHEADLE: Sometimes, you know, because I go on online
###116 dates, so the people who are online dates can get kind of
###119 weird sometimes.
###119 BLAKE EASTMAN: You know the online pool is
###120 contaminated, right?
###120 HARRY CHEADLE: Ha, ha, ha.
###121 Yeah, that's a good idea.
###122 BLAKE EASTMAN: I would challenge you to get the hell
###124 off online dating, man.
###125 HARRY CHEADLE: I'm thinking about doing this
###126 speed dating event.
###127 It's like three-minute interactions.
###128 It's going to be like 20--
###130 BLAKE EASTMAN: --how many?
###131 20 three-minute interactions?
###131 HARRY CHEADLE: Yeah, like in an hour.
###132 I think that's what it is.
###133 It's something like that.
###135 So what kind of advice do you want to give
###137 me to, like, make--
###138 BLAKE EASTMAN: OK, so movement really works.
###140 If you go, literally, like five or six
###143 minutes before a date--
###144 I mean, get there like 10 minutes early--
###146 and go to the bathroom, or go wherever, and just start
###148 throwing as many punches or jumping up and down--
###150 HARRY CHEADLE: Like literally, like--
###151 BLAKE EASTMAN: You know, I have no idea.
###152 Literally, it will lower cortisol levels and increase
###154 testosterone levels as you move.
###155 So for example, get on the floor.
###157 HARRY CHEADLE: What do you mean?
###158 BLAKE EASTMAN: Push ups.
###159 HARRY CHEADLE: Push ups?
###159 BLAKE EASTMAN: Yeah, do push ups.
###160 HARRY CHEADLE: OK.
###161 All right, I'll do some push ups.
###164 How many push ups do you want me to do?
###165 BLAKE EASTMAN: Your push ups are bad.
###166 HARRY CHEADLE: My push ups?
###166 Well, I haven't done push ups that much.
###167 BLAKE EASTMAN: Chest up.
###168 Chest up.
###168 HARRY CHEADLE: Chest up?
###168 BLAKE EASTMAN: Yeah.
###169 All right, good.
###170 Get up now.
###170 Now jump up and down.
###171 HARRY CHEADLE: Just like this?
###173 BLAKE EASTMAN: Yeah, but see, even your
###174 jumping's not confident.
###175 Like if you're gonna jump, start jumping.
###176 Get excited about it, or something like--
###178 HARRY CHEADLE: --like I'm excited about jumping, right?
###179 BLAKE EASTMAN: Yeah, I still feel that you're
###181 awkward right now.
###181 HARRY CHEADLE: Yeah, I feel that I'm awkward--
###183 BLAKE EASTMAN: --because you feel awkward.
###183 HARRY CHEADLE: Yeah.
###184 BLAKE EASTMAN: Right.
###185 HARRY CHEADLE: Blake filmed me to demonstrate just how bad I
###188 was at standing around, then showed me some videos of his
###191 body language students.
###192 Some of it was too subtle for me to understand, but I did
###195 like his technique.
###196 I'm going to start videotaping my friends for later analysis.
###199 BLAKE EASTMAN: Have a go at it.
###199 HARRY CHEADLE: Yeah.
###200 Thanks to you.
###200 BLAKE EASTMAN: No problem.
###201 HARRY CHEADLE: Thanks for doing this.
###202 
###206 So I feel I learned a lot from Blake about communicating and
###209 using my hands to get my point across and
###211 interact with people.
###212 But I want to try it out in the field.
###214 So I'm here in The Watering Hole, a bar and restaurant in
###216 Manhattan, where I'm going to go on some speed dating.
###219 And I'm going to meet 15 girls in about 45 minutes.
###222 And that just seems like a bad idea.
###225 But I need to try this out.
###226 And I need to figure out if girls like
###229 me, if I like girls--
###230 I know I like girls--
###232 and I'm going to deal with my nervousness in two ways.
###236 I'm going to do those exercises Blake taught me.
###239 And I'm going to get drunk.
###240 
###247 MAYRA PERDOMO: Hi.
###247 How are you?
###247 HARRY CHEADLE: Hi.
###248 I'm good.
###249 I'm Harry.
###249 I'm here for the speed dating thing, the On Speed Dating.
###252 MAYRA PERDOMO: Yes, Harry.
###253 HARRY CHEADLE: Yeah.
###254 MAYRA PERDOMO: Is this your first time
###255 speed dating with us?
###255 HARRY CHEADLE: It is, yeah.
###256 I have no idea of how this works.
###257 MAYRA PERDOMO: You're going to have fun.
###258 Don't worry about it.
###258 HARRY CHEADLE: OK.
###258 All right.
###259 MAYRA PERDOMO: But if you'd like, we're just having
###261 everybody hang out at the bar.
###262 
###267 HARRY CHEADLE: I didn't remember exactly why Blake
###270 told me to exercise before going on a date.
###272 Something to do with the hormones?
###274 Maybe women are naturally drawn to men who are a little
###276 out of breath?
###278 In any case, punching the air in front of a mirror does make
###280 you feel like a cool, tough guy who is ready to throw down
###283 at a moment's notice.
###284 
###292 This looks like the kind of place where you
###293 fall in love, right?
###294 I'm sure plenty of people have started relationships here.
###297 Christ.
###298 [BELL RINGING]
###302 MAYRA PERDOMO: So for all of you that haven't done this
###304 before, it's very, very simple.
###306 What we're going to do is everybody's going to have a
###308 three-minute date.
###309 I hope you guys all find love.
###311 And thank you, again, for coming.
###312 [BELL RINGING]
###314 HARRY CHEADLE: Hey.
###315 MICHELLE: Hi.
###315 HARRY CHEADLE: Hey.
###316 Hey.
###317 GERALDINE: Hi.
###317 - Hi.
###318 HARRY CHEADLE: How are you doing?
###319 I'm Harry.
###319 I'm Harry.
###320 ISABEL: I'm Isabel.
###320 HARRY CHEADLE: Hey, I'm Harry.
###321 NICKEE: Harry--
###322 - How are you?
###323 HARRY CHEADLE: How are you?
###323 I'm Harry.
###323 - How are you?
###323 HARRY CHEADLE: I'm good, I'm Harry.
###325 - Eric, nice to meet you.
###326 HARRY CHEADLE: No, no, Harry.
###327 Yeah.
###327 - Oh, Harry.
###328 HARRY CHEADLE: Yeah.
###329 No.
###329 It's a confusing name.
###331 I'm Harry.
###332 KAITLIN: Kaitlin, nice to meet you.
###332 HARRY CHEADLE: Kaitlin, nice to meet you.
###334 AGNES: Hi, I'm Agnes.
###335 Nice to meet you.
###335 HARRY CHEADLE: Nice to meet you.
###336 I'm Harry.
###337 AGNES: How are you?
###337 HARRY CHEADLE: I'm good.
###338 AGNES: How's it going?
###339 HARRY CHEADLE: Good, good.
###340 Yeah.
###340 AGNES: Good.
###341 HARRY CHEADLE: How are you?
###342 AGNES: I'm good, fantastic.
###343 HARRY CHEADLE: I'm a shy guy naturally.
###346 Yeah, is that coming across?
###347 I feel like this is like everyone's New Year's
###349 resolution.
###349 - Ha, ha, ha.
###350 Totally.
###350 Totally.
###350 HARRY CHEADLE: It's like they're either at the gym, or
###353 they're here.
###354 I like your earrings.
###354 They're very nice.
###355 But they're very big and round.
###357 ANGELIQUE: Basically.
###358 HARRY CHEADLE: You work with Chris Brown.
###359 ANGELIQUE: I'm doing a Rihanna impression.
###360 HARRY CHEADLE: Oh, yeah, yeah.
###361 That's like representing--
###362 GERALDINE: --yeah--
###363 HARRY CHEADLE: --Stalin or something.
###364 GERALDINE: Yeah.
###365 - Are you looking for a relationship?
###367 Are you looking for marriage?
###368 HARRY CHEADLE: Oh, God, no.
###370 Not marriage.
###370 Well, yeah, maybe divorce.
###372 You're not looking to get married and have kids?
###374 - Well, not tomorrow.
###375 HARRY CHEADLE: OK, good.
###376 Look, thank God.
###377 Because I'm not up for anything like that.
###379 You love surgery.
###380 - Yes.
###381 HARRY CHEADLE: And you love cutting dogs open, basically.
###384 - Yeah, I like to.
###384 HARRY CHEADLE: I like your earrings.
###386 They're very dangly and big.
###388 NICKEE: Thank you.
###388 [BELL RINGING]
###389 HARRY CHEADLE: Well, that bell, it's very nervewracking,
###392 isn't it?
###392 - It is.
###393 Meeting new people is sometimes nervous for me.
###395 And then, like, the bell goes off.
###398 And like, oh, God, what's happening?
###398 NICKEE: Oh, it's over.
###399 HARRY CHEADLE: Fuck meeting new people.
###400 I don't need this.
###401 I could be more enthusiastic, I guess.
###404 
###407 By the end of the speed dates, I felt like a slightly drunk,
###410 squeezed-out dishrag.
###412 I'd be surprised if any of my dates liked me, because I sure
###415 hated myself.
###417 Well, that wears you out.
###418 Jesus.
###419 
###426 So it turns out that meeting 15 people for three minutes
###429 each in 45 minutes is kind of stressful and
###433 kind of not that helpful.
###434 I was trying to do everything Blake taught me.
###437 I was trying to be positive with my body language.
###439 But the truth is that when you're meeting people, you
###441 think about where your feet are or where their feet are,
###444 or where your hands are supposed to be, or if they're
###445 supposed to be waving around.
###446 You're thinking about the person.
###448 Sometimes it just doesn't work out.
###450 You're just not compatible.
###451 But I think that's OK.
###452 You know, it's OK, actually, not to like that many people
###456 and to wait around for the people that you like.
