0:0:0,988 --> 0:0:2,47
JOHN MCAFEE: I need a lawyer.


3
0:0:2,47 --> 0:0:6,422
And Sam tells me you
are a good lawyer.


4
0:0:6,422 --> 0:0:11,37



5
0:0:11,37 --> 0:0:15,37
Trust me, sir, every newspaper
in the world will fly here


6
0:0:15,37 --> 0:0:16,84
instantly to talk to me.


7
0:0:16,84 --> 0:0:17,19
Yes.


8
0:0:17,19 --> 0:0:19,67
Will you please forgive
my appearance?


9
0:0:19,67 --> 0:0:24,59
I need a tailor that can
very quickly, sir,


10
0:0:24,59 --> 0:0:27,93
make a suit, a shirt.


11
0:0:27,93 --> 0:0:30,56
Because I cannot speak
like this.


12
0:0:30,56 --> 0:0:31,28
Thanks, [INAUDIBLE]


13
0:0:31,28 --> 0:0:33,68
SAM VANEGAS: I forgot!


14
0:0:33,68 --> 0:0:34,93
[INAUDIBLE]


15
0:0:34,93 --> 0:0:44,17



16
0:0:44,17 --> 0:0:46,64
JOHN MCAFEE: So I
need to do it?


17
0:0:46,64 --> 0:0:47,79
I need my suit.

19
0:0:50,47 --> 0:0:52,65
JOHN MCAFEE: Do you have the
power, sir, to make this man


20
0:0:52,65 --> 0:0:54,22
sew a little faster?


21
0:0:54,22 --> 0:0:55,25
TELESFORO GUERRA: Of course.


22
0:0:55,25 --> 0:0:56,395
JOHN MCAFEE: Okay, good.

[INTERPOSING VOICES]


24
0:0:56,73 --> 0:0:57,98
TELESFORO GUERRA: Of course.


25
0:0:57,98 --> 0:1:2,98



26
0:1:2,98 --> 0:1:4,83
JOHN MCAFEE: I think there's
nothing to prove.


27
0:1:4,83 --> 0:1:5,533
I was not there.


28
0:1:5,533 --> 0:1:7,505
I was with Sam the
entire night.


29
0:1:7,505 --> 0:1:12,52
I have more than half a dozen
witnesses to the fact.


30
0:1:12,52 --> 0:1:15,15
I had no motive.


31
0:1:15,15 --> 0:1:18,8
I had no access to
a 9-millimeter.


32
0:1:18,8 --> 0:1:20,5
I don't what there is
to prove, really.


33
0:1:20,5 --> 0:1:22,34
Whatever it is they want to talk
to me about, I think, has


34
0:1:22,34 --> 0:1:24,81
very little to do with the
murder of Mr. Faull.


35
0:1:24,81 --> 0:1:28,67
And very much to do with their
collecting me on any charge


36
0:1:28,67 --> 0:1:31,18
whatsoever.


37
0:1:31,18 --> 0:1:32,24
Where do we have to go?


38
0:1:32,24 --> 0:1:32,94
We'll do it right now.


39
0:1:32,94 --> 0:1:33,47
Just do it now.


40
0:1:33,47 --> 0:1:35,11
Come on.


41
0:1:35,11 --> 0:1:36,41
Right now.


42
0:1:36,41 --> 0:1:37,35
You've never seen this
before, have you.


43
0:1:37,35 --> 0:1:39,7
SAM VANEGAS: No, never
in my life.


44
0:1:39,7 --> 0:1:41,415
JOHN MCAFEE: This is my life
in America, sweetie.


45
0:1:41,415 --> 0:1:44,78
So you'll see that I am quite
comfortable with this.


46
0:1:44,78 --> 0:1:49,24
I have for five years lived
in Belize peacefully.


47
0:1:49,24 --> 0:1:52,92
Seven months ago, the Belizean
government sent 42 armed


48
0:1:52,92 --> 0:1:55,32
soldiers into my property.


49
0:1:55,32 --> 0:1:57,26
They killed one of my dogs.


50
0:1:57,26 --> 0:1:59,7
They broke into all
of my houses.


51
0:1:59,7 --> 0:2:0,18
They stole.


52
0:2:0,18 --> 0:2:2,0
They arrested me and kept
me handcuffed in


53
0:2:2,0 --> 0:2:4,8
the sun for 14 hours.


54
0:2:4,8 --> 0:2:7,35
I was taken to jail, and it was
only the intervention of


55
0:2:7,35 --> 0:2:9,919
the US embassy that got
me out of jail.


56
0:2:9,919 --> 0:2:12,98
Since that time, I have been
continually harassed by the


57
0:2:12,98 --> 0:2:13,91
government.


58
0:2:13,91 --> 0:2:17,32
They have attempted to charge
me with every crime, ranging


59
0:2:17,32 --> 0:2:21,11
from running an antibiotics
laboratory without a license,


60
0:2:21,11 --> 0:2:24,3
to hiring security guards
without a license, to having


61
0:2:24,3 --> 0:2:26,66
improper paperworks
for my company.


62
0:2:26,66 --> 0:2:29,59
And most recently, the murder
of my neighbor.


63
0:2:29,59 --> 0:2:32,48
I had to leave, but the
story has to get out.


64
0:2:32,48 --> 0:2:36,635
I have documentation that proves
the intense corruption


65
0:2:36,635 --> 0:2:39,0
at all levels of the Belizean
government.


66
0:2:39,0 --> 0:2:41,96
Now that I am in a safe place,
I can speak freely.


67
0:2:41,96 --> 0:2:46,38
I will be talking on my blog,
whoismcafee.com, starting


68
0:2:46,38 --> 0:2:48,71
tonight, revealing the
truth about Belize.


69
0:2:48,71 --> 0:2:49,96
And thank you very much.
