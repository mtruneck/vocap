1
0:0:3,449 --> 0:0:12,12
The sun has shed light on our home for over
4 billion years.


2
0:0:12,12 --> 0:0:17,33
It will continue to do so for another 4.


3
0:0:17,33 --> 0:0:21,45
It is massive almost beyond comprehension.


4
0:0:21,45 --> 0:0:29,809
Constant, yet ever changing.


5
0:0:29,809 --> 0:0:35,47
Born from a swirling cloud of dust and gas,
it is a giant fusion engine that drives the


6
0:0:35,47 --> 0:0:35,89
solar system.


7
0:0:35,89 --> 0:0:42,37
It seethes and boils like a living thing.


8
0:0:42,37 --> 0:0:50,94
Loops of plasma rise up, so large they would
dwarf Earth.


9
0:0:50,94 --> 0:1:3,829
Explosions flash on its surface.


10
0:1:3,829 --> 0:3:3,829
And yet the sun also gives us warmth. And
life. And beauty.
