###11 >> Right now it is my pleasure
###13 to introduce our luncheon speaker today George P. Bush.
###17 George is a partner in Pennybacker Capital.
###19 I can give you a little bit of his background
###20 and I'm sure he'll fill you in with some more.
###22 He received his bachelor's degree from Rice University
###26 and then he's also a UT Alum.
###28 He graduated from the law school
###30 with his JD here at, from UT Austin.
###33 Prior to joining Pennybacker, he practiced law with Akin, Gump,
###37 Strauss, Hauer and Feld doing corporate and securities law,
###40 and before that he clerked in Dallas
###43 for federal district Judge Sidney Fitzwater
###46 who I also clerked for so we know each other that way.
###49 It's my pleasure to introduce George P. Bush.
###51 As you all know, he comes from a family with a long
###53 and storied tradition of public service and he continues
###56 that as a naval reserves intelligence officer
###59 and he recently was mobilized to Afghanistan
###62 and I'm sure he'll tell us a little bit about that as well.
###64 So please join in welcoming George P. Bush.
###65 [applause]
###65 >> Thank you Ronnie [assumed spelling], I appreciate it.
###71 Thank you Ronnie and thank you for what you do for Subiendo.
###76 The very little that I know
###77 about the organization I've been blown away
###79 with what you guys are accomplishing this week.
###81 I wouldn't be surprised if there's a future president in,
###85 in this room and I'm I'm really delighted to to get
###87 to know y'all and my hope is that you guys can think
###91 of any questions that you might have for me,
###94 any comments you might have about the Bush family that you'd
###98 like to share, and any any kind of stories you'd like me to kind
###102 of focus on because I really wanted this to be interactive
###105 and about you guys and maximizing the time
###108 that you guys have here
###109 on the beautiful campus University of Texas in Austin.
###112 When I was asked to talk a little bit about leadership,
###115 I I wanted to talk a little bit about my personal experiences
###119 and I want to first say at the outset
###121 that I'm a truly blessed kid
###124 to be born into, into the Bush family.
###127 When I was 12 years old,
###129 my grandfather was first elected president
###132 after Ronald Reagan left office.
###135 But right before he was sworn in as president
###138 of the United States I was asked to join with a,
###141 a group called Americares which is one
###144 of the largest non-for profit organizations in the world,
###146 and they deliver needed supplies
###148 to to disaster recovery efforts throughout the world.
###152 And I don't know if you recall but in 1992 there was one
###156 of the largest earthquakes recorded in human history
###158 in Armenia which was a former soviet republic or a republic
###163 within kind of the shield of the sov- former Soviet Union.
###166 And I was asked at the age of 12 years to fly in a cargo plane
###171 with the first supplies to to Armenia
###173 to deliver much needed supplies to kids of of that were victims
###179 of the earthquake and I was totally blown away
###181 by the experience.
###182 This was a very desolate area of the world.
###185 50,000 people died, most of whom died
###188 under the rubble while they were waiting for supplies
###191 that we were attempting to deliver.
###193 The Soviets themselves were unable to deliver these supplies
###196 to to their own people and yet we at Americans at the height
###200 of the cold war we were the first ones delivering
###203 these supplies.
###204 And I'll never forget going to a children's hospital
###208 where a 5th grade class was,
###210 was sitting in class learning their their cl-
###214 learning their their instruction for the day
###216 and the earthquake taking place
###218 and over half of the students died.
###220 And one kid that I met survived that rubble,
###223 survived during his time in the rumble after the earthquake.
###226 He had lost several limbs and I delivered him a bible
###231 because this was a religious school.
###234 And the kid cried and he told me this is the best Christmas he
###236 ever had.
###237 And to me at a young age, at the age of 12 to to have
###241 that perspective of what the true meaning
###243 of Christmas was all about was, was mind-blowing.
###247 Following that, when my grandfather was in office,
###249 I had a chance to live in the white house
###250 which was pretty cool.
###252 You know Dwight D. [inaudible] President Eisenhower built a
###255 bowling alley in the in the basement of the white house.
###258 There's also the rose garden where you know some
###261 of my favorite professional athletes,
###263 you know when they win the championship they always go
###264 and say hello to the president, deliver a jersey,
###267 so that was pretty cool getting getting
###269 to know professional athletes and getting their autographs.
###272 But my grandmother, for those of you
###274 who may not know Barbara Bush, kind of the silver fox
###277 of the Bush family, wears the pants if you will [laughter].
###281 She's kind of the boss.
###283 She made sure that none of us as grandkids were spoiled
###286 so she wanted us to go work at a at a soup kitchen
###290 which I did during the time that I lived in the white house.
###293 And again, at the young age of 14, learned tremendous amount
###297 about about those that are less fortunate in one
###301 of the poorest areas of our country.
###302 When my uncle was elected to office from 2000 and and served
###309 until 2008, I had the chance
###310 to join three American delegations throughout the world
###315 and I had a chance to see more perspectives, more perspectives
###319 than most kids my age.
###321 Probably the most powerful experience was getting to go
###324 to Nicaragua, Nicaragua for those that are,
###328 for a different accent,
###329 but during the first peaceful transfer of power
###333 in that country's history following a president
###337 by the name of Chamorro where during her swearing in,
###340 the inauguration had to be called off
###342 because of violence basically,
###344 threats of of of her assassination.
###347 And so we, the the new president that was sworn
###350 in was President Bolanos and being in a foreign country
###354 and following the American flag to the podium
###357 in which the American delegation sat
###359 down behind the newly sworn president
###361 in the first peaceful transfer of power was an amazing moment,
###366 especially when half the crowd was booing the US.
###368 It really puts things in perspective in terms of,
###372 in terms of of being patriotic and supporting your country.
###376 The point of all these stories that I wanted
###379 to convey is is the importance of giving back, the importance
###382 of volunteering, of being thoughtful
###385 of others in your community.
###387 That's the best way to become a leader I think
###390 and understanding those that need help,
###394 those that need support.
###395 When I was in high school I had the opportunity
###398 to teach inner city kids in Havana,
###400 in little Havana, baseball.
###403 I was, the only reason why I got into Rice basically was
###407 because of my ability to play baseball.
###408 I had a chance to play with Alex Rodriguez in high school
###411 which is kinda cool, and Lance Berkman
###413 and a few other pros at Rice.
###416 But but working with with inner city kids and baseball
###419 and teaching them the life skills of of basically stepping
###425 up and being leaders in their own homes,
###427 in their own right was was also an important experience.
###431 In, in Houston when I was at Rice I also had the chance
###434 to to work for a Catholic charity on the weekend with,
###438 with kids, also in inner city schools in Houston.
###441 And there, once again,
###442 had an incredible experience teaching English to the child
###446 of an undocumented immigrant
###448 who was illiterate even, even in Spanish.
###450 And so we worked, he was a very unruly child, I was assigned
###454 by one of his teachers who had difficulties with him,
###458 and we worked over the course of two years.
###461 Eventually he learned English.
###462 He graduated from junior high, was the first in his family
###465 to graduate from high school and and being patient and working
###469 with him, again, was a transformational experience,
###473 and I think I grew as a person in terms
###476 of learning what what's important in life.
###478 And to this day I'm involved with Big Brothers, Big Sisters.
###481 I'm sure some of you in the room have heard of this organization.
###485 There's an interesting program that we're working
###488 at Big Brothers, Big Sisters where over 90% of kids
###492 of of felons do not go on to graduate from high school.
###496 And when you look at our state of Texas,
###498 even within the Latino population in many areas
###501 of our great state, we have a dropout rate of over 50%.
###505 This to me is one of the, the the largest crisis that we face
###509 and that your, our generation collectively will face
###512 as future educators, future leaders
###514 in our state and our country.
###516 And so I look forward to working with you on, on these issues.
###520 The importance of public service can't be denied.
###524 You know it's very easy when you when you look
###526 at the voting participation rates in our country,
###529 you know whether you're looking
###530 at the last presidential election cycle, less than 25%
###533 of 18 to 29 year olds bothered to show up at the polls.
###537 Many of you will be voting for the first time
###540 in the next election cycle and I encourage you to register
###543 to vote, to to get involved in that way and get involved
###546 in the political campaign.
###548 That's the best way to to to learn
###550 about the issues of the day.
###551 There's other w- forms of public service as well.
###554 My, another experience that I had was serving in the military
###558 and seeing firsthand in Afghanistan,
###560 the fifth poorest country in the world,
###562 the importance of public service.
###564 We spend $2 billion a week in in this country rebuilding
###569 and creating a democracy in an area of the country
###573 where not a lot of people want democracy,
###575 where self-identification is more defined by tribe
###579 as opposed to country.
###580 You ask the average Afghan whether they consider themselves
###584 Afghan, they consider themselves Pashtun or Gerudo or
###587 or some other ethnic tribe as opposed to Afghan.
###591 And so even though we as Americans are doing so much
###595 in Iraq and Afghanistan, part of public service has to come from,
###599 from the community, from people like all of y'all.
###603 And so I I look forward to to further talking
###606 about the importance of that.
###608 Here in the U.S. I I can't help but think
###611 about when people complain about politics and they complain
###614 about government, that at the same time they don't get
###617 involved and run for office or help out political campaigns or
###621 or or do, or volunteer in their communities.
###624 And I can't help but think of a quote from Plato where he says
###627 that the consequence of of not being involved
###630 in your government and not being involved in public service is
###633 that you end up being governed by your inferiors.
###635 And that's not to say that our current political leaders,
###638 republican or democrat, are inferior or a cast
###641 of of inferiors, but it is to say that if
###644 if our generation doesn't step up, then we face a huge crisis,
###649 a huge deficit where people choose not to get involved
###652 in public service and leadership positions.
###655 There's so many different ways
###656 to get involved outside of politics.
###658 As a member of a Bush family it's,
###660 it's easy to say you know go out and run for office,
###663 but there's non-for-profit organizations
###665 that I know y'all are already involved in in your high schools
###668 and that you will be involved in in college.
###671 There's also non-for-profit organizations that affect issues
###676 that that you feel passionately about.
###678 And it doesn't necessarily have to be education or mentoring,
###681 but there's so many different special interest groups
###685 that you can get involved in and I would just encourage you all
###688 to volunteer time and your effort.
###689 You know the extra moments that you spend with,
###693 with others makes a difference.
###695 One person at a time.
###696 I remember being an inner city high school teacher and starting
###700 out the year with 150 students and by the end
###703 of the year I was left with about 90 students.
###705 I had several, several kids drop out due to possession
###710 of narcotics, possession of weapons,
###713 and what I learned is instead of looking at, you know,
###717 the macro issue sometimes,
###718 sometimes your victories are one kid at a time,
###720 one student at a time.
###721 And so I I encourage you to look at issues that way as well.
###725 So with that I want to turn it back to you guys
###728 to offer any kind of, any kind
###731 of commentary that you might have.
###732 I'm I'm, I want to open a dialogue
###734 to any questions you might have 'cause otherwise I could be
###737 up here all all night long, all afternoon long talking to you
###741 so I'd encourage any questions you might have.
###745 >> All right.
###746 Hello. So you know I think
###748 that everything the United States does
###749 for other countries is amazing, you know with Americare,
###752 with giving back, you know helping Afghanistan rebuild
###755 themselves, Iraq, but you know while all that is happening,
###758 in the U.S. we have our own crisis.
###761 27,000 high school students, you know, are gonna be without 70%
###765 of funding because of the education budget cuts.
###767 So what is your stance on the education budget cuts?
###770 >> Well thankfully I'm not in elected politics so I don't ,
###774 I don't have a committed position on the issue but,
###777 you're absolutely right.
###778 I mean we have, we're spending billions of dollars a week
###782 if not every month on both the conflicts in Afghanistan, Iraq,
###787 now Libya, and we're looking at other, other conflicts
###792 that arising with the spring, the Arab spring
###796 if you will call it that, and Syria and Yemen.
###801 And it's it's a generational change
###802 that many people never thought that they would see
###804 in the middle east and so what, not only rhetorically
###808 as Americans in terms
###809 of our foreign policy is it important what we do,
###811 but in terms of how we commit our existing assets
###814 and resources is going to be vital.
###817 I am one to to believe that we are still the most powerful
###822 country in the world and that that our matter,
###826 that our actions matter.
###829 And so you know I commend our current leaders
###832 to their thoughtful approach
###834 to what's happening in the middle east.
###836 In terms of what's happening here in the state of Texas,
###838 absolutely, we face an education crisis.
###841 The stats speak to themselves whether you're talking
###843 about high school dropout rates in the valley
###847 within the Hispanic population.
###849 When you look at the state budget, education is roughly 60%
###854 of the overall budget.
###855 We had, come heading into this legislative session we had
###859 about a 20 to $30 billion shortfall
###863 which is a pretty large, large deficit to make up.
###866 And so when you're, when you're talking about closing that gap,
###869 if you're serious about it, for better or worse you have
###872 to look at cuts in education.
###875 So since we're doing that, unless you want to raise taxes
###878 which is not always the most politically popular thing to do.
###881 So when doing that you have to balance where, where do we cut?
###886 And one of the, I haven't been following it as closely as most,
###890 but in terms of what we're seeing right now is is allowing
###893 for more tenured teachers and you know teachers
###897 that are closer to retirement to retire early and
###900 and basically you know younger teachers that are going
###903 into the profession are paid a little bit less than the
###906 than the more experienced and and veteran teachers.
###909 There's also you know looks
###912 of accounting you know gimmicks basically
###914 to to basically instead of have it go with inflation,
###918 keep it fairly flat lined for the next two years so that,
###922 so that revenues will catch up with spending.
###925 So, long winded way of saying that we're gonna have
###929 to make some tough decisions.
###930 It's not gonna please everybody.
###931 There will probably be some teachers that are let go,
###935 but if we're gonna be serious about, you know,
###938 balancing our budget, you know you and if you're serious
###942 about doing it, you look at a majority
###944 of the budget, it's in education.
###946 And so, so what I would also advocate is looking
###949 at maximizing, you know, the dollars to make sure
###952 that every dollar that we're spending
###953 in education is doing what it's intended to do.
###957 So I would put everything on the table,
###959 how do we reform education to make it such that
###962 when you guys are graduating from college,
###964 you you are paid accordingly for for results.
###968 So that if you are working in an inner city school
###971 and you are taking a class of, in in a failing school from,
###976 you know mediocre test results to to above mediocre
###980 or above average, you should be rewarded for that.
###983 And so, implementing some types
###986 of reforms I think would go a long way as well.
###989 Excellent question by the way.
###992 >> You spoke of high dropout rates,
###994 what would you propose to lower those?
###998 >> To me, you know when I was in an inner city high school school
###1003 and in Miami when I was teaching, I was actually
###1006 in the dropout prevention program.
###1008 So a lot of the kids in the state of Florida,
###1011 and I believe it's the case in Texas
###1015 that when you turn 16 you can legally drop out.
###1017 So most of the kids at my class, this is freshman year,
###1020 9th grade, that were already 16,
###1024 well a lot of my young women were were pregnant
###1027 and I already had, you know many young men
###1030 that had a prison record or, you know, had been in and out
###1033 of of juvenile institutions.
###1036 So without sounding sarcastic, there's gonna be a percentage
###1041 of students that we're gonna be,
###1043 that that's gonna be very difficult
###1045 to reach out to and change.
###1047 We we can't rescue every kid,
###1049 but what we can do is create a curriculum that's more relevant
###1052 to the lives of those that are thinking
###1054 about a different path in life.
###1057 As a p-, not every kid is gonna go to, to Harvard and Yale
###1061 or great schools like UT.
###1063 What can we do in our curriculum to make, make it more relevant
###1068 so that if kids have an interest in, you know, technology,
###1071 or an interest in auto repair, that they can do so immediately
###1075 in high school when they're not learning about, you know,
###1078 16th century, you know, art.
###1081 You know and and it's just not not as relevant in terms
###1084 of what they're gonna see in terms
###1085 of a tangible job out there.
###1086 We're blessed to be in a state where we've created,
###1089 in in the last since the beginning
###1091 of the recession almost a third of every job created in the U.S.
###1095 which is unbelievable to think about.
###1096 So, you hit on a very important issue, how do we get that kid
###1100 who is in 9th grade thinking about dropout,
###1103 just to hold on until 12th grade?
###1106 There's been measures proposed to to to pay students to get
###1110 through high-- I I'm not an advocate of that.
###1112 I do believe that if we incentivize teachers, the best
###1116 and the brightest that come out of our universities,
###1119 that want to take on a career in education that they go
###1122 into the inner city like Teach for America
###1124 which is a great program, to go out and take
###1127 on these huge challenges.
###1129 'Cause I think with passionate teaching
###1130 and passionate administ- you guys know,
###1132 you're in high school.
###1134 You you learn more with teachers that are engaged and passionate
###1137 about your, your own life.
###1139 And so if we can incentivize and create a structure for teachers
###1143 to do that, I think that would go, go a much longer way.
###1147 >> Hi my name is Stephen Dominguez.
###1150 I'm from here in Austin, Texas and well first of all thank you
###1155 so much for sharing your story, it was very inspiring,
###1158 and for being here today.
###1161 We have this proposal project going on that we're supposed
###1164 to find a problem maybe within our community and how to fix it,
###1169 my question is maybe what do you think
###1173 that we could do right now, the coming rising seniors going back
###1177 to our senior year in high school
###1179 to maybe improve our community in any way since you have
###1182 such great experience?
###1184 >> Absolutely.
###1186 There there's a there's a lot of different issues.
###1188 I think mentoring is is a big one.
###1193 You know Big Brothers, Big Sisters is a,
###1195 I'm a huge advocate for it.
###1197 There's so many different non-for-profit organizations
###1199 that, that get involved in the community.
###1202 There's recycling programs, environmental programs
###1206 that I think you can build the leadership, build a board
###1209 of advisors if you will
###1211 that would guide you towards you know raising a certain amount
###1214 of money to-- I would consider being an entrepreneur
###1218 in non-for-profits you know because you're,
###1221 after having visited with you you're obviously, you know,
###1225 a bright kid and a huge future.
###1227 Why not create your own non-for-profit
###1230 and you know create a business.
###1231 You know there's a cool industry that's developing here in Austin
###1235 in terms of social entrepreneurship
###1237 where you take small business principles,
###1239 go out create a non-for-profit, write a business plan,
###1242 go out and raise money and then impact an issue
###1245 that you personally feel passionate about.
###1247 Rally other people around the cause.
###1249 Get a board of advisors of people that have experience
###1252 in that area to allow you to go out
###1254 and build it, build the dream.
###1257 Here at UT, I can't tell you how many great non-for-profits have
###1261 stemmed from UT students that were here during college
###1265 and created these wonderful business plans while they were,
###1267 while they were studying because they felt passionate about it.
###1270 They found time and prioritized time in their own schedule
###1273 to do it which is pretty amazing.
###1275 In fact one that I'm involved with here
###1278 in Austin is called East Side Community Connection
###1281 where we feed predominantly transient families
###1286 that that are either seeking political asylum in our country
###1290 or are undocumented immigrants.
###1293 And you know the poverty rate is fairly high,
###1296 and while they stabilize their lives,
###1298 you know we help them get educated, we help feed them,
###1301 we provide financial literacy
###1304 as they get acclimated to to Austin.
###1306 The the organization was founded just six years ago.
###1310 It was kind of a, it's almost like starting a small business;
###1313 it's kind of a risky venture at first but we were able
###1316 to get a good board of advisors, we got great speakers.
###1319 We had Colt McCoy come one year which is cool,
###1322 and and raised a lot of money
###1324 and the rest had kind of taken off.
###1325 So I would, I wouldn't rule that out as well as kind
###1329 of joining an existing, you know, non-for-profit.
###1333 >> Hello [inaudible] George Garcia from Brownsville, Texas.
###1337 And okay so aside from funding issues and dropout rates,
###1340 I know that compared to other leading nations
###1344 in the education system, the states score lower than 50%
###1350 in some of the tests, and in fact Washington D.C.,
###1354 the nation's capitol, scores about 6%, the lowest in fact
###1358 of the whole United States and it's just proven
###1362 that our education system is not as effective
###1365 as other nations, leading nations.
###1366 I wanted to ask you what do you think is setting us back
###1370 and what we can do to improve it?
###1372 >> That's a very good question.
###1373 I think, you know, to further add to your question,
###1377 one of the most startling aspects
###1379 where we're behind is math and science.
###1381 When you c- when you look at the totality of it,
###1383 we are you know roughly 50 percentile, but when you look
###1387 at science and math we're we're at the bottom
###1389 of industrialized nations
###1390 and so that's problematic for our future.
###1395 The tiny country, the tiny country
###1397 of Taiwan is producing roughly, roughly 10 times the amount
###1401 of patents, intellectual property,
###1403 that we are producing as Americans.
###1406 Here at UT it's one of the few areas, we're blessed
###1409 to be surrounded by brilliant scientists and engineers
###1412 that are putting out, you know, intellectual property,
###1415 you know, on a daily basis.
###1417 But there's not enough of that.
###1418 So what I would propose is, again going back to the point
###1422 of designing a curriculum that's more germane to the lives
###1426 of people in terms of finding a job.
###1429 'Cause I think there's this huge gap
###1430 between high school and the real world.
###1433 And you know there's, one of the first investors in Facebook,
###1437 Peter Thiel, I don't know if you've heard of that name,
###1439 he's he's a radical on this issue.
###1442 He says that much of what we're learning
###1444 in in high school is really irrelevant to to what kind
###1448 of jobs you're gonna take on.
###1450 And so what I would propose for those
###1452 that demonstrate an interest in math and science in junior high
###1456 that there's there's a feeder system for you to go on and
###1459 and work in a laboratory early on, and you're working side
###1462 by side by engineers,
###1464 and so there's an apprenticeship approach where you're learning
###1467 with people in the field and you have an ability to get a job
###1470 at say Exxon or Shell or a huge publicly held company
###1475 that are dying for engineering and and science talent.
###1480 Another thing that's happening is is that, using the example
###1483 of Rice at grad school,
###1485 in the computer sciences school I think there was roughly
###1489 over 100 students, 90% were Chinese nationals
###1493 and they graduated at the top of the class.
###1496 And what we did is that most of them went back to China.
###1500 They, because they saw more opportunity and and not only
###1503 that but you know we we have reduced the amount
###1506 of H1 visas that, H1B visas which we provide to those
###1511 that want to learn in math and science, the ability to stay
###1513 in our country to take on jobs.
###1516 Why not r- I mean, the U.S. univers- post-secondary,
###1519 including UT in the analysis is still the number one choice
###1523 in the world.
###1524 You you travel across the the world and you still see
###1528 that the the influential,
###1529 and their societies are still sending their kids here.
###1531 Why not tap that talent and and create incentives for them,
###1534 for them to stay as well as change the organic structure
###1537 of our own country
###1539 to get involved more in math and science?
###1543 The second point that I wanted to make with respect
###1545 to your question is just overall wholesale reform.
###1548 Right now our approach to education
###1550 in the 20th century is a factory, is a one size fits all.
###1555 So, in my opinion, the structure of what a school
###1558 in Highland Park is the same as what you see in Brownsville
###1562 and that's not, I don't think that matches with reality.
###1565 I think you have, we need to go back to a little red schoolhouse
###1568 on the on the block approach to education
###1570 where the teachers know the students, there's open lines
###1574 of communication, there's parent teacher interaction
###1578 and we've reduced the size of classes.
###1581 I remember when I was a teacher and I had over 40 students
###1584 in my class, you guys know what it's like;
###1586 it's it's just pandemonium.
###1588 When you have, and when you go to great schools you'll see
###1592 that you're you're going to,
###1594 the learning experience is gonna be enhanced
###1596 when you have more one on one interactions
###1598 with teachers as well.
###1600 So reducing class sizes I think would go a long way and
###1604 and making schools more relevant to the communities
###1607 in which they're reliant as opposed to a,
###1609 a factory sized approach to, to education.
###1612 >> Hi my name is Alexa Edwards and I'm from Dallas and,
###1617 once again, thank you for being here.
###1618 And I just wanted to point out obviously we are the generation
###1622 of technology and I really just wanted to know your stance
###1625 on technology in schools 'cause I know
###1627 that it has its advantages and disadvantages,
###1630 advantages being you know it's easier to use, it's faster,
###1633 you know it's most relevant to what's going on in our society,
###1636 but the disadvantages that our skills in writing
###1640 and math obviously are decreasing.
###1643 So I just wanted to know how, do you think it's better
###1646 that technology is becoming such an important factor in schools
###1650 or do you think that we should pay attention more
###1652 to the basics and the fundamentals?
###1654 >> Well I I think that's a very good question and it's one that,
###1658 you know, as as educators we constantly have
###1660 to think about honestly.
###1662 I I personally would advocate that we embrace technology.
###1665 You know the, the scale by which technology is improving our
###1669 lives is dramatic.
###1670 There's definitely downside.
###1671 I mean taking the experience of being a high school teacher,
###1675 most of my students you know basically write in short,
###1679 truncated sentences as opposed to well thought out paragraphs.
###1682 That's certainly a downside.
###1683 But the upside is that you're you're catching a huge
###1686 tidal wave.
###1687 You know companies like Apple, Facebook, Google,
###1691 really were created by entrepreneurship and creativity
###1696 and I think if we are embracing technology in a
###1700 in a secondary education environment,
###1702 we're giving young Americans a chance to,
###1705 to think about how we can further innovate and
###1709 and further think of ways to make, you know,
###1711 technology more interesting and relevant
###1713 to the lives of of the world.
###1715 That's one of the advantages that we have I think
###1717 as Americans is that we have Silicon Valley.
###1720 Silicon Valley is now exporting more than just
###1724 about any other region of our country because,
###1728 you know you you read their articles in India and China
###1731 about the latest Apple products that are released,
###1733 you see lines going out the door.
###1735 We've traditionally as Americans have exported, you know, Chevy's
###1740 and cars and I think those days are are gone.
###1743 But everybody around the world has got a Facebook account,
###1747 and so I think to the extent
###1748 that we can dovetail technology with, with high school education
###1753 and make it, make it relevant, and apply business models to,
###1758 to what's out there I think that it's an exciting thing.
###1762 Without losing grasp of of fundamental education, the X's
###1765 and O's that that that kids need before, you know, graduating.
###1770 >> Hello, I'm [inaudible] a deaf student from [inaudible]
###1774 and I aspire to be a surgeon.
###1777 I want to know what is your, what is your opinion of the,
###1783 what, what do you think is a growing problem
###1788 in the medical community, a growing problem
###1792 in the medical community
###1793 that requires the attention of everybody here?
###1797 >> Do do you mind restating please?
###1802 Sorry.
###1803 >> Sorry I'm--
###1805 >> No no no.
###1807 >> What is your opinion, what do you think is a growing problem
###1815 in the medical community?
###1819 >> In the, which commun- medical community?
###1822 >> Yeah.
###1824 >> What do you think is a, is the growing problem
###1831 of the medical community?
###1833 >> Very good question.
###1836 It's a- it's definitely at the center of everybody's mind
###1840 in terms of, you know, the recent proposal
###1843 that has come from, from the white house in terms
###1846 of what the future of healthcare looks like in our country.
###1849 Not only that but applications
###1852 to medical schools are are down significantly.
###1856 It's no longer viewed as as the profession
###1859 in many respects as as it once was.
###1861 Unfortunately there are too many lawyers, and the,
###1863 and I can say that as a lawyer.
###1866 And and I would not discourage you to to
###1869 to not look at medicine.
###1870 I think it's a wonderful profession
###1872 and you know it's obviously been beneficial to our country.
###1877 But in my opinion, in my humble opinion, I think there needs
###1881 to be, similar to my thoughts on education,
###1884 there needs to be reform with respect to, to healthcare.
###1888 One of the great things
###1889 about our country is is having optionality whether it's,
###1893 you know, going down the street to to get McDonald's as opposed
###1897 to Burger King or hopefully choosing the school
###1901 that you want to send your kids to as opposed to another school
###1904 that the same would apply to healthcare, that you would get
###1907 to choose basically what doctor you see for what purposes
###1912 and at what time, as opposed to having mandates that kind
###1916 of dictate how healthcare should look like.
###1919 I'm I'm a bel- I believe in decentralized government
###1922 where whether you're talking about, you know, education,
###1925 healthcare, that power basically flows to, to local communities
###1931 because people have different needs
###1933 in different parts of our country.
###1936 So there's obviously a looming crisis.
###1938 You look at, as a percentage of our national budget,
###1941 and this has been the discussion of the Medicare
###1943 and Medicaid discussion, entitlements are roughly 60%
###1948 of our of our total budget and healthcare represents
###1951 about a third of that.
###1952 And so again it's similar to the question about,
###1956 you know, Texas education.
###1957 You know you really can't talk about reducing the size
###1961 of our debt without talking about healthcare,
###1962 so you know we really have a lot
###1965 of important decisions ahead of us.
###1968 Thankfully I'm not in politics so I don't have to worry,
###1970 worry as much about it.
###1972 >> Hi my name's Jennifer.
###1974 Actually I will be moving to Baltimore after this
###1976 and doing Teach for America.
###1977 So I'm really excited about that--
###1978 >> Congratulations.
###1979 That's awesome.
###1979 >> Thank you.
###1980 Thank you.
###1980 But my question, you were talking
###1982 about I guess training different schools
###1987 to do I guess vocational opportunities for students,
###1989 but I think my concern with that would be getting teachers
###1993 or counselors who automatically assume minorities would
###1997 eventually go that route and not give them the opportunity
###2000 for them to actually excel in their studies.
###2002 >> Yeah.
###2002 >> So my question for you would be, how would you prevent
###2005 that from happening for students?
###2007 Instead of, you know, giving them a chance to succeed
###2009 in school in their studies versus, you know,
###2011 just automatically assuming a vocational route for them?
###2015 >> Absolutely.
###2015 That's a great, a great point
###2017 and a great question 'cause it can't be a self-selecting
###2021 criteria mainly because of your background as a student
###2024 and what community you reside in.
###2026 It would be an opt in program where basically teachers
###2031 and the students, basically would have to make
###2033 that that decision together as a joint decision as opposed
###2037 to you know some higher power from Austin,
###2040 Texas or Washington, D.C. deeming you
###2042 to be a kid who's going on a certain, certain track
###2045 as opposed to one that you desire.
###2047 So I I probably should clarify that in terms of,
###2051 in terms of having a curriculum that's more relevant to the
###2054 to the to the lives of those.
###2057 I I just think that there's a wonderful opportunity
###2059 to to re-approach education in a way that there's an open canvas
###2063 in which we really delve into the interests of of students and
###2068 and creating the bridge between growing up in the community
###2072 and going off to a job of the future.
###2075 Because even though we have more 4 to 500 companies in this state
###2079 than any other state in the country,
###2082 in other words there's a lot of opportunity out there, we still,
###2086 in my opinion have not created a pipeline by which dir-
###2089 where where these students can go on and get those jobs
###2093 of the future that, for companies that are innovative
###2095 and going out and creating.
###2097 I mean Facebook for example, they're,
###2098 they've just moved a large office here to Austin
###2101 which is really exciting
###2101 and they're they're gonna bring I think roughly 1,500 employees.
###2105 Legalzoom.com, Zynga, and so what's happening here in Austin
###2110 on the tech side of things is really exciting back to your,
###2114 your question earlier about whether,
###2117 whether we can embrace technology and if a kid early
###2119 on demonstrates an interest in saying that's the company I want
###2122 to work for, I want to work for Facebook and I want
###2124 to be CEO one day, creating a curriculum
###2127 that would allow a kid, instead of learning about, you know,
###2129 medieval, and I'm a history major, medieval military history
###2133 or something wouldn't be the most relevant
###2136 to getting that job.
###2136 So, so creating a structure I think that's flexible would be,
###2141 would be ideal.
###2143 >> Hi my name is Perla Roman, I'm from Houston, Texas.
###2146 I have a question about immigration and education.
###2150 As I personally have friends who have dropped
###2152 out of high school claiming that they can't pursue a career or go
###2154 to college because of their legal status,
###2156 so I would like to know what's your stand
###2158 on granting illegal immigrant students citizenship?
###2163 >> Well there's been a proposal that was pending
###2165 in congress called the the dream act
###2168 which would allow the children
###2171 of undocumented immigrants the ability to obtain state citizen,
###2178 state citizens, same tuition as as state kids basically,
###2182 in state tuition is what I'm trying to say.
###2186 And that was recently,
###2187 it's basically scuttled in the senate.
###2190 I think there's ways, there's there's a middle ground 'cause
###2193 obviously it's a very competitive education
###2195 environment and there are families here in Texas
###2198 who feel slighted that children
###2200 of undocumented immigrants get the same pay in price point as,
###2205 as an in state person.
###2208 I I think there's litmus, there's a litmus test.
###2210 Instead of looking at it as you know black and white
###2213 that there's a spectrum there.
###2214 So if if, if an undocumented family, if let's say,
###2219 and I'm just talking out loud here 'cause, you know,
###2222 this is UT and we think creatively, is that,
###2224 is that you know if the parents demonstrate an ability
###2228 to pay back taxes, have taxes with withheld
###2232 on a going forward basis so they're paying into the system,
###2235 so there's less kind of concern
###2237 about where you know public funding stands in terms of,
###2242 where the kid stands and what they're what they're taking
###2245 from the system, and they demonstrate
###2247 over a certain amount of years a,
###2248 a kind of a continuous occupation
###2253 and you know there's fluency in English and that there's,
###2256 you know, no commission of felony, felonies during
###2261 that time, that we're beginning to move in a direction
###2264 where I think we should allow for in state tuition
###2266 because again it goes back to the issue
###2268 about how we make changes to to our education system
###2274 and creating incentives by which we have very talented people
###2278 that were, had no control over where they're,
###2282 where they were born and where they were educated
###2284 and what their legal status is.
###2286 So there's, there's a,
###2287 many people in immigration unfortunately view it as a black
###2291 and white issues and republicans are just as guilty as democrats
###2294 in that issue for being not constructive in this debate.
###2298 There are 20 million undocumented immigrants
###2301 that live in our country today.
###2302 This is another issue that we as a ge-
###2303 as our generation will face and how do, and they're having kids,
###2307 they're having a lot of kids.
###2309 You know in the Anglo community,
###2311 the average child per family is is less than 2.1
###2316 which is roughly the amount you need to you know keep your pa-
###2320 your population growing.
###2321 And among the Hispanic community it's,
###2323 it's it's above that, which is great.
###2326 We need to embrace, you know,
###2328 we need to embrace a vibrant immigrant community,
###2331 that's what our country was built on and,
###2334 and you I think there's there's gotta be incentives there
###2337 for the kids that want to get a higher education.
###2341 So I'm, again I'm glad I don't have to deal
###2344 with that issue 'cause I think it's a complicated one but,
###2347 because when people talk about immigration it touch- touches
###2350 on every issue indirectly -- education, healthcare,
###2353 national security, drug trafficking.
###2357 So, but I'm I'm for proposals like the dream act.
###2362 I think it's it's a wonderful incentive to make sure
###2365 that there are incentives there
###2368 to get a higher education we shouldn't be dis- discouraging.
###2371 >> Join me in thanking [inaudible] [applause]
