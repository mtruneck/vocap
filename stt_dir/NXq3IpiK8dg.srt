CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: Fridays are awesome
on CNN STUDENT NEWS. We`ve been hearing from


2
0:0:4,8 --> 0:0:8,38
some of you looking for more global headlines,
we`ve got them, plus a report on Veterans


3
0:0:8,38 --> 0:0:12,55
Days. We are going to let Ms. Colvin`s (ph)
students kick things off for us.

0:0:12,55 --> 0:0:15,44
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


5
0:0:15,44 --> 0:0:28,949
UNIDENTIFIED MALES AND FEMALES: Hi. This is
Ms. Colvin`s sixth grade advanced study class


6
0:0:28,949 --> 0:0:37,629
at East Hamilton Middle School. Take it away,
Carl!


7
0:0:37,629 --> 0:0:40,519
(END VIDEO CLIP)


8
0:0:40,519 --> 0:0:46,729
AZUZ: First up, a new economic record in Greece
and not a good one. In August, the country`s


9
0:0:46,729 --> 0:0:52,999
unemployment rate hit 25.4 percent. That means,
a quarter of the entire country is out of


10
0:0:52,999 --> 0:0:58,399
work, and if you are 24 or younger, that unemployment
rate jumps 260 percent.


11
0:0:58,399 --> 0:1:3,139
Greece has been struggling through a recession
for five years. The country has massive debt.


12
0:1:3,139 --> 0:1:8,39
It`s getting a bailout, money to help out
with this debt. But in order to get that money,


13
0:1:8,39 --> 0:1:12,63
the Greek government has to find ways to get
its debt under control. What it`s been trying


14
0:1:12,63 --> 0:1:18,329
so far is austerity, spending cuts to things
like workers` salaries and pensions. Many


15
0:1:18,329 --> 0:1:22,59
Greeks obviously not happy about this. While
the country`s parliament was getting ready


16
0:1:22,59 --> 0:1:27,34
to approve a new round of cuts this week,
thousands of protesters were fighting with


17
0:1:27,34 --> 0:1:30,439
police outside the parliament building.


18
0:1:30,439 --> 0:1:34,179
From Greece, we are going to move across the
Atlantic Ocean to Guatemala. Parts of that


19
0:1:34,179 --> 0:1:38,539
Central American nation are recovering after
it was hit by a powerful earthquake earlier


20
0:1:38,539 --> 0:1:44,78
this week. The quake had a magnitude of 7.4.
That made it the strongest quake to hit Guatemala


21
0:1:44,78 --> 0:1:49,78
in more than 35 years. According to the country`s
president, at least 52 people were killed


22
0:1:49,78 --> 0:1:55,109
in the quake, hundreds of others were treated
for injuries, thousands of homes were damaged,


23
0:1:55,109 --> 0:2:0,85
and roads collapsed with rubble crushing cars
all over Guatemala. The president said the


24
0:2:0,85 --> 0:2:3,929
damage of devastation could have been worse.


25
0:2:3,929 --> 0:2:9,429
Finally, we are heading over to Japan. In
March of 2011, you might remember, the country`s


26
0:2:9,429 --> 0:2:15,4
suffered its worst earthquake ever: triggered
a tsunami and giant ocean wave, and that led


27
0:2:15,4 --> 0:2:18,58
to a meltdown at the Japanese nuclear facility.


28
0:2:18,58 --> 0:2:23,4
We`ve reported on debris from that disaster
washing ashore in Hawaii and in Alaska. But


29
0:2:23,4 --> 0:2:29,6
Japanese officials still have tons of it to
deal with there, in Japan, and as Alex Zolbert


30
0:2:29,6 --> 0:2:31,569
explains, you can`t just throw it away.


31
0:2:31,569 --> 0:2:32,4
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


32
0:2:32,4 --> 0:2:37,4
ALEX ZOLBERT, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It`s been
more than a year and a half since the devastating


33
0:2:37,4 --> 0:2:43,53
tsunami in Japan`s Tohoko region. And while
substantial progress has been made, the country


34
0:2:43,53 --> 0:2:49,25
is still grappling with more than 13 million
tons of debris.


35
0:2:49,25 --> 0:2:54,53
About 20 percent of what remains is said to
be destroyed in other parts of the country.


36
0:2:54,53 --> 0:3:0,579
Today, trucks arrive at this incineration
plan in Shizuoka, several hours drive south


37
0:3:0,579 --> 0:3:7,0
of Tokyo. Officials say, these debris is the
shredded remnants of people`s homes, about


38
0:3:7,0 --> 0:3:14,819
250 kilometers or 150 miles from the crippled
Fukushima nuclear plant. But with concerns


39
0:3:14,819 --> 0:3:20,22
over possible fallouts still running high,
officials here measure radiation levels, before


40
0:3:20,22 --> 0:3:28,799
a small crowd of onlookers. It`s a well choreographed,
very deliberate routine. According to officials,


41
0:3:28,799 --> 0:3:35,0
this debris fails to trigger any elevated
readings. The shipment is cleared. The truck


42
0:3:35,0 --> 0:3:40,719
pulls in and dumps its load, which is then
hoisted into the incinerator.


43
0:3:40,719 --> 0:3:44,379
Once concerned citizens are pleased with what
they`ve seen today.


44
0:3:44,379 --> 0:3:48,879
There are the critics here in Shizuoka, some
who question the logic in transporting these


45
0:3:48,879 --> 0:3:55,239
debris more than 700 kilometers, or about
430 miles across the country. Than there are


46
0:3:55,239 --> 0:3:59,42
those who said a government should have been
more transparent.


47
0:3:59,42 --> 0:4:5,39
Masahiro Kasyua (ph) says the affected area
is using all of its incineration resources,


48
0:4:5,39 --> 0:4:10,87
they need our help, but we will continue to
make our case as we`ve been doing. Carefully


49
0:4:10,87 --> 0:4:11,89
and tenaciously.


50
0:4:11,89 --> 0:4:18,53
A long and tedious project that is not short
on controversy.


51
0:4:18,53 --> 0:4:20,25
Alex Zolbert, CNN, Shizuoka, Japan.


52
0:4:20,25 --> 0:4:21,11

54
0:4:22,4 --> 0:4:28,26
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Today`s "Shoutout" goes
out to Ms. Flax`s social studies classes at


55
0:4:28,26 --> 0:4:33,67
Ness City Junior Senior High School in Ness
City, Kansas.


56
0:4:33,67 --> 0:4:39,89
Armistice Day celebrate the end of what conflict?
Here we go, was it American Revolution, World


57
0:4:39,89 --> 0:4:50,53
War I, Crimean War or World War II? You`ve
got three seconds, go!


58
0:4:50,53 --> 0:4:56,67
Armistice Day marked the end of World War
I. That`s your answer and that`s your "Shoutout",


59
0:4:56,67 --> 0:5:0,69
but that`s not what the holiday is called
anymore in the U.S.


60
0:5:0,69 --> 0:5:2,82
(END VIDEO CLIP)


61
0:5:2,82 --> 0:5:8,96
AZUZ: No, it`s not. Armistice Day originally
marked the 11th hour of the 11th day of the


62
0:5:8,96 --> 0:5:14,38
11th month in 1918. That`s when the armistice
went into effect ending the fighting in World


63
0:5:14,38 --> 0:5:20,79
War I. But in 1954, President Eisenhower changed
the name to Veterans Day in honor of everyone


64
0:5:20,79 --> 0:5:24,9
who`s ever served in the U.S. armed forces.
So, whether that was during the Iraq war,


65
0:5:24,9 --> 0:5:29,83
for instance, in a humvee like this one beside
me, or during a time of peace, Veterans Day


66
0:5:29,83 --> 0:5:34,5
occurs every year on November 11th. There
are services like the traditional reed playing


67
0:5:34,5 --> 0:5:38,66
at the Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington National
Cemetery, and for Americans nationwide, it`s


68
0:5:38,66 --> 0:5:44,33
a chance to honor one of the country`s 21.5
million veterans, even if that`s simply by


69
0:5:44,33 --> 0:5:46,14
saying, thank you for your service.


70
0:5:46,14 --> 0:5:47,8
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


71
0:5:47,8 --> 0:5:52,7
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Is this legit? A document
that`s faked or designed to be misleading


72
0:5:52,7 --> 0:6:0,79
is a forgery. This is true. Forged document
are ones that have been made or altered falsely.


73
0:6:0,79 --> 0:6:2,34
(END VIDEO CLIP)


74
0:6:2,34 --> 0:6:8,62
AZUZ: Well, you might think that as students
would forge a document in order to get out


75
0:6:8,62 --> 0:6:13,56
of school. There is a 21-year old in Michigan
who recently forged a transcript and birth


76
0:6:13,56 --> 0:6:18,72
certificate in order to go to school. He went
to class, played on a high school football


77
0:6:18,72 --> 0:6:24,23
team. James Felton of affiliate WNEM tells
us what happened after the truth came out.


78
0:6:24,23 --> 0:6:24,8
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


79
0:6:24,8 --> 0:6:28,72
JIM CONWAY, MOUNT PLEASURE H.S. ATHLETIC DIR.:
Any time you are duped to -- or, you know,


80
0:6:28,72 --> 0:6:32,58
lied to, if you will, there is some frustration
that comes with that.


81
0:6:32,58 --> 0:6:35,27
JAMES FELTON, WNEM CORRESPONDENT: Mount Pleasant
High School athletic director, Jim Conway,


82
0:6:35,27 --> 0:6:39,86
is in shock. He is still trying to figure
out why a 21-year old would lie his way back


83
0:6:39,86 --> 0:6:44,51
to high school and play for the football team.
That`s exactly what happened to his Oiler


84
0:6:44,51 --> 0:6:45,95
ball club this season.


85
0:6:45,95 --> 0:6:50,15
CONWAY: When it comes to something like this,
and integrity issue becomes difficult to swallow.


86
0:6:50,15 --> 0:6:54,81
FELTON: 21-year old used false documents to
attend a school under the alias Javier Jones


87
0:6:54,81 --> 0:6:59,63
(ph). He played five games for the football
team. Here you see him, he`s wearing number


88
0:6:59,63 --> 0:7:3,89
one. After the school received the tip from
a concerned parent, Nash`s (ph) true identity


89
0:7:3,89 --> 0:7:7,38
was discovered. He was immediately removed
from the district.


90
0:7:7,38 --> 0:7:10,7
Now, two Oiler victories may be forfeited.


91
0:7:10,7 --> 0:7:13,89
CONWAY: He just fit in with all the other
high school kids, with the 16-17-18 year old


92
0:7:13,89 --> 0:7:16,94
kids who belong there, there were really no
red flags.


93
0:7:16,94 --> 0:7:21,3
FELTON: Meanwhile, Conway says the students
athletes are angry their hard work may be


94
0:7:21,3 --> 0:7:22,91
tarnished by one individual.


95
0:7:22,91 --> 0:7:27,7
CONWAY: They are frustrated, or if not more
frustrated than the adults in this situation,


96
0:7:27,7 --> 0:7:31,12
which was good to see. I think the kids have
learned a valuable lesson, they are asking


97
0:7:31,12 --> 0:7:33,51
the questions why and now just like we are
as adults.


98
0:7:33,51 --> 0:7:34,7
(END VIDEOTAPE)


99
0:7:34,7 --> 0:7:39,24
AZUZ: Right now for a positive story from
the football field. From a football faker


100
0:7:39,24 --> 0:7:44,5
to one that certainly looks like the real
thing. Watch this. The pee wee player tearing


101
0:7:44,5 --> 0:7:50,86
up the field in this Youtube video, definitely
deserves a highlight reel. 35 touchdowns,


102
0:7:50,86 --> 0:7:57,51
65 tackles, nearly 2000 rushing yards. It`s
amazing. She is dominating the league.


103
0:7:57,51 --> 0:8:3,53
Yeah, I said, she. Samantha Gordon, she prefers
the name "Sam," nine years old, she plays


104
0:8:3,53 --> 0:8:10,15
offence and defense in a mostly boys league
in Utah. And she is amazing. During tryouts


105
0:8:10,15 --> 0:8:15,36
before the season started, Sam was tops in
almost every drill. What`s crazy is that she


106
0:8:15,36 --> 0:8:20,43
just started playing football this year, it`s
not even her favorite sport. She likes soccer


107
0:8:20,43 --> 0:8:20,93
better.


108
0:8:20,93 --> 0:8:26,4
The nearly 2 million people -- yeah, 2 million
people have seen her play football, they might


109
0:8:26,4 --> 0:8:28,56
disagree with that.


110
0:8:28,56 --> 0:8:33,1
Rosalie Reimer is a little bit older than
Sam Gordon, she is 15. That means she doesn`t


111
0:8:33,1 --> 0:8:37,219
have her driver`s license yet. But if you
think that`s kept her from getting behind


112
0:8:37,219 --> 0:8:43,879
the wheel -- it hasn`t. Of course, Rosalie
doesn`t drive regular cars, she drives this.


113
0:8:43,879 --> 0:8:47,879
Monster truck. She showed off her skills at
the Arizona State Fair last weekend. When


114
0:8:47,879 --> 0:8:53,79
she is not in school, Rosalie is part of a
monster truck competition circuit. She actually


115
0:8:53,79 --> 0:8:58,25
worked with her dad to build this behemoth,
which is named detour. She is planning to


116
0:8:58,25 --> 0:9:3,259
go to college, get a degree in engineering,
go to work designing racers, but she`ll probably


117
0:9:3,259 --> 0:9:7,889
still be connected to monster trucks. Rosalie
says this is kind of thing you just never


118
0:9:7,889 --> 0:9:9,43
get tired of.


119
0:9:9,43 --> 0:9:14,579
Finally, getting a caravan together might
be kind of a tall order. But that`s what you


120
0:9:14,579 --> 0:9:19,329
are dealing with when you are transporting
a giraffe. You see its head? There it is.


121
0:9:19,329 --> 0:9:24,17
Two-year old giraffe in Australia is moving
from one zoo to another, keeper said she was


122
0:9:24,17 --> 0:9:28,75
old enough to start mixing with other giraffes.
Besides, she was about to outgrow her old


123
0:9:28,75 --> 0:9:33,1
home. It might sound like a risky proposition
to move an exotic animal, but I`m sure they


124
0:9:33,1 --> 0:9:36,75
are used to this kind of thing, they probably
didn`t have to stick their necks out. And


125
0:9:36,75 --> 0:9:41,25
how do you decide which drivers get to be
in the convoy? They probably used a giraffal


126
0:9:41,25 --> 0:9:46,279
(ph) system. And afterwards, they could tell
their friends, a tall tale. Yeah, that`s right.


127
0:9:46,279 --> 0:9:49,75
Giraffe puns. Head and shoulders above the
rest. It`s time for us to hit the road, have


128
0:9:49,75 --> 0:11:49,75
a great weekend, we`ll see you again on Monday,
by now.
