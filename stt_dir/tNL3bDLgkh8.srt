1
0:0:3,621 --> 0:0:6,822
Steve Jobs was
a genius of the modern age.


2
0:0:6,822 --> 0:0:8,969
He gave us tools
to change our lives


3
0:0:8,969 --> 0:0:12,32
and the way we communicate.


4
0:0:12,32 --> 0:0:14,582
Here comes a device
that comes with no manual,


5
0:0:14,582 --> 0:0:19,205
and everybody knows
how to use it... amazing.


6
0:0:19,205 --> 0:0:21,4
They weren't just hits in
the sense that they sold well,


7
0:0:21,4 --> 0:0:24,711
but they actually changed
the whole nature of technology


8
0:0:24,711 --> 0:0:27,213
and caused everyone else
to follow them.


9
0:0:27,213 --> 0:0:30,381
This intimate portrait
is a revealing insight


10
0:0:30,381 --> 0:0:32,25
into Steve Jobs' life...


11
0:0:32,25 --> 0:0:35,819
Andy Warhol gets
down on his hands and knees,


12
0:0:35,819 --> 0:0:37,89
Steve showing him
how to use the mouse.


13
0:0:37,89 --> 0:0:40,242
His career...


14
0:0:40,242 --> 0:0:42,258
He shook up
a whole industry.


15
0:0:42,258 --> 0:0:43,47
His character...


16
0:0:43,47 --> 0:0:45,402
Steve loved
those creative ideas.


17
0:0:45,402 --> 0:0:47,8
His faults...


18
0:0:47,8 --> 0:0:48,412
Steve ultimately
betrayed everyone.


19
0:0:48,412 --> 0:0:50,274
His artistry...


20
0:0:50,274 --> 0:0:52,77
Just the smooth
lines of it.


21
0:0:52,77 --> 0:0:54,438
And his achievements...


22
0:0:54,438 --> 0:0:56,81
He is going to inspire
a whole new generation.


23
0:0:56,81 --> 0:0:59,876
By the people
who knew him best.


24
0:0:59,876 --> 0:1:2,851
I'd give a lot to have
Steve's taste.


25
0:1:2,851 --> 0:1:4,599
If he needed You,
he was your best friend,


26
0:1:4,599 --> 0:1:5,99
and he would seduce you.


27
0:1:5,99 --> 0:1:7,693
When I was having a hard time,
he would be on the phone,


28
0:1:7,693 --> 0:1:9,851
he'd drive up
from silicon valley,


29
0:1:9,851 --> 0:1:13,829
take me out for dinner,
hang out and take walks with me.


30
0:1:13,829 --> 0:1:16,43
He turned on me,
total street bully,


31
0:1:16,43 --> 0:1:19,4
in my face, screa...
We were... and I went crazy.


32
0:1:19,4 --> 0:1:20,21
I'd never been there.


33
0:1:20,21 --> 0:1:21,944
I don't ever want
to be there again.


34
0:1:21,944 --> 0:1:24,983
How much fun we had... ohh...


35
0:1:24,983 --> 0:1:27,421
How much fun we had in those
days doing things together,


36
0:1:27,421 --> 0:1:32,112
you know, but you lose it,
you can't ever go back,


37
0:1:32,112 --> 0:1:37,624
and just to have those conversations
that make us both smile.


38
0:1:37,624 --> 0:1:40,271
Through their eyes,
we reveal what made him


39
0:1:40,271 --> 0:1:42,457
the man who always gave us...


40
0:1:42,457 --> 0:1:45,59
Now there's
one more thing.


41
0:1:45,59 --> 0:1:47,756
Steve Jobs


42
0:1:47,756 --> 0:2:10,361
Steve Jobs
"One Last Thing"


43
0:2:10,361 --> 0:2:14,27
Steven Paul Jobs died
on October 5, 2011,


44
0:2:14,27 --> 0:2:17,401
at the age of 56,


45
0:2:17,401 --> 0:2:25,141
a life cut short
in its creative prime by cancer.


46
0:2:25,141 --> 0:2:28,109
His death was
not a surprise,


47
0:2:28,109 --> 0:2:38,886
and yet its impact
reverberated around the world.


48
0:2:38,886 --> 0:2:42,563
The news had spread,
and the tributes were created


49
0:2:42,563 --> 0:2:47,972
on the new iDevices that
his visionary genius had made.


50
0:2:47,972 --> 0:2:51,646
His is a success story that
could only have happened


51
0:2:51,646 --> 0:2:53,238
in the U.S.A.


52
0:2:53,238 --> 0:2:55,442
I don't mean to say
that there aren't geniuses


53
0:2:55,442 --> 0:2:58,743
and world-changing people
everywhere... there are...


54
0:2:58,743 --> 0:3:1,22
But I think in Jobs' case,


55
0:3:1,22 --> 0:3:3,124
the particular path
of his career,


56
0:3:3,124 --> 0:3:5,32
this could only have
happened in America.


57
0:3:5,32 --> 0:3:8,2
Steve Jobs'
world-class salesmanship found


58
0:3:8,2 --> 0:3:12,96
a global audience in his famous
Apple product presentations.


59
0:3:12,96 --> 0:3:15,223
He always had
"one more thing" to announce.


60
0:3:15,223 --> 0:3:17,195
Everyone thinks, "wow.
That's... that's so much,"


61
0:3:17,195 --> 0:3:18,369
and, "well, we got
one more thing,"


62
0:3:18,369 --> 0:3:20,16
and then you put
your biggest thing at the end


63
0:3:20,16 --> 0:3:21,899
because it'll tip it.


64
0:3:21,899 --> 0:3:26,339
It's good, uh... it's
good showmanship really.


65
0:3:26,339 --> 0:3:28,908
Tragically
that "one more thing"


66
0:3:28,908 --> 0:3:34,111
has now become "one last thing."


67
0:3:34,111 --> 0:3:37,751
The news that Steve Jobs
had finally logged out


68
0:3:37,751 --> 0:3:40,861
made headlines everywhere.


69
0:3:40,861 --> 0:3:47,561
This man really had
changed the world.


70
0:3:47,561 --> 0:3:50,227
When you grow up,
you tend to get told


71
0:3:50,227 --> 0:3:52,526
that the world
is the way it is,


72
0:3:52,526 --> 0:3:56,964
and your... your life is just to
live your life inside the world,


73
0:3:56,964 --> 0:3:59,939
try not to bash
into the walls too much,


74
0:3:59,939 --> 0:4:2,178
try to have
a nice family life,


75
0:4:2,178 --> 0:4:4,976
have fun, save a little money.


76
0:4:4,976 --> 0:4:8,249
In this exclusive,
never before seen interview,


77
0:4:8,249 --> 0:4:13,88
Steve Jobs gave a rare glimpse
of his vision of the world.


78
0:4:13,88 --> 0:4:14,718
That's a very limited life.


79
0:4:14,718 --> 0:4:16,22
Life can be much broader


80
0:4:16,22 --> 0:4:18,424
once you discover
one simple fact,


81
0:4:18,424 --> 0:4:21,568
and that is everything
around you that you call life


82
0:4:21,568 --> 0:4:25,731
was made up by people that
were no smarter than you,


83
0:4:25,731 --> 0:4:28,201
and you can change it,
you can influence it,


84
0:4:28,201 --> 0:4:33,272
you can build your own things
that other people can use.


85
0:4:33,272 --> 0:4:40,81
Um, once you learn that,
you'll never be the same again.


86
0:4:40,81 --> 0:4:42,31
In the Los altos suburb


87
0:4:42,31 --> 0:4:44,845
of San Francisco, California,


88
0:4:44,845 --> 0:4:47,453
just about everybody
was an engineer


89
0:4:47,453 --> 0:4:50,323
or worked in electronics


90
0:4:50,323 --> 0:4:54,292
a childhood spent here
in the future silicon valley


91
0:4:54,292 --> 0:5:0,37
was the first key lucky break
in Steve Jobs' young life.


92
0:5:0,37 --> 0:5:7,359
His closest childhood
friend was Bill Fernandez.


93
0:5:7,359 --> 0:5:9,409
In about eighth grade,
halfway through,


94
0:5:9,409 --> 0:5:11,582
this new guy came
into the school,


95
0:5:11,582 --> 0:5:15,446
who was Steve Jobs,
and we were both introverted,


96
0:5:15,446 --> 0:5:18,447
intellectual,
kind of socially inept,


97
0:5:18,447 --> 0:5:21,282
and we gravitated
towards each other.


98
0:5:21,282 --> 0:5:24,385
The two boys shared
the same hobby.


99
0:5:24,385 --> 0:5:26,155
We started taking long walks
and talking


100
0:5:26,155 --> 0:5:30,859
about the meaning of life
and what is this all about,


101
0:5:30,859 --> 0:5:32,462
and after a while
we started doing...


102
0:5:32,462 --> 0:5:33,896
In addition to walking
and talking...


103
0:5:33,896 --> 0:5:36,434
Doing electronics
projects together.


104
0:5:36,434 --> 0:5:39,702
Fernandez also knew
another electronics geek,


105
0:5:39,702 --> 0:5:42,798
his neighbors' son
Steve Wozniak,


106
0:5:42,798 --> 0:5:45,641
universally known as Woz.


107
0:5:45,641 --> 0:5:48,544
So one day, Steve Jobs bicycled
over to hang out with me


108
0:5:48,544 --> 0:5:50,614
and do electronics projects
in the garage,


109
0:5:50,614 --> 0:5:54,23
and out in front was Wozniak
washing his car.


110
0:5:54,23 --> 0:5:57,9
So I thought to myself,
"ok. This Steve is


111
0:5:57,9 --> 0:5:59,698
"an electronics buddy,
he's an electronics buddy.


112
0:5:59,698 --> 0:6:2,67
They'd probably like to
meet each other."


113
0:6:2,67 --> 0:6:5,157
Fernandez
had no idea at the time


114
0:6:5,157 --> 0:6:7,743
that the meeting
between his two friends


115
0:6:7,743 --> 0:6:9,754
would change our world.


116
0:6:9,754 --> 0:6:13,166
Jobs and Woz were soon to
start a business together.


117
0:6:13,166 --> 0:6:15,766
Its name was Apple.


118
0:6:15,766 --> 0:6:17,488
If Woz and Jobs
had never met,


119
0:6:17,488 --> 0:6:19,417
there never would have been
an Apple computer.


120
0:6:19,417 --> 0:6:21,247
There would have
been computers,


121
0:6:21,247 --> 0:6:23,461
and there would have
been personal computers,


122
0:6:23,461 --> 0:6:26,719
but we probably wouldn't have
the kind of


123
0:6:26,719 --> 0:6:28,592
wonderful empowering
things that people


124
0:6:28,592 --> 0:6:31,921
fall into if Woz
and Jobs hadn't met.


125
0:6:31,921 --> 0:6:33,954
This neighborhood
we grew up in had


126
0:6:33,954 --> 0:6:36,257
a lot of
lockheed engineers in it,


127
0:6:36,257 --> 0:6:39,36
and I would go up
and down the street


128
0:6:39,36 --> 0:6:40,702
to the various dads
on the street


129
0:6:40,702 --> 0:6:42,466
and get mentored
in electronics,


130
0:6:42,466 --> 0:6:44,966
and Steve Wozniak's father
was one of the people


131
0:6:44,966 --> 0:6:46,573
who mentored me.


132
0:6:46,573 --> 0:6:47,974
As Jobs and I were
walking over,


133
0:6:47,974 --> 0:6:49,842
I noticed Woz out
washing his car,


134
0:6:49,842 --> 0:6:53,71
and I said, "hey, Woz.
Um, come over and meet Steve."


135
0:6:53,71 --> 0:6:55,846
So, "Steve, meet Steve."


136
0:6:55,846 --> 0:6:57,257
And this is where
it happened,


137
0:6:57,257 --> 0:7:0,21
basically right here.


138
0:7:0,21 --> 0:7:3,254
Woz and Jobs became
inseparable friends,


139
0:7:3,254 --> 0:7:6,454
but their first venture was not
a computer.


140
0:7:6,454 --> 0:7:8,896
The pair developed
an electronics Kit


141
0:7:8,896 --> 0:7:10,926
mimicking telephone
router codes


142
0:7:10,926 --> 0:7:13,365
to make free calls
around the world.


143
0:7:13,365 --> 0:7:14,698
You know, when you make
a long distance phone call


144
0:7:14,698 --> 0:7:16,972
in the background you hear,
"do do do do do"?


145
0:7:16,972 --> 0:7:19,939
Those are the telephone computers
actually signing each other,


146
0:7:19,939 --> 0:7:23,872
sending information to each
other to set up your call.


147
0:7:23,872 --> 0:7:26,742
And there used to be
a way to fool


148
0:7:26,742 --> 0:7:28,51
the entire telephone system
into thinking


149
0:7:28,51 --> 0:7:31,748
you were
a telephone computer.


150
0:7:31,748 --> 0:7:34,626
You could, you know,
call from a pay phone,


151
0:7:34,626 --> 0:7:37,89
go to white plains, new York,
take a satellite to Europe


152
0:7:37,89 --> 0:7:41,13
take a cable to turkey,
um, come back to Los Angeles,


153
0:7:41,13 --> 0:7:42,656
and you'd go around the world
3 or 4 times and call


154
0:7:42,656 --> 0:7:45,233
the payphone next door,
shout in the phone,


155
0:7:45,233 --> 0:7:48,408
and be about 30 seconds, it
would come out the other phone.


156
0:7:48,408 --> 0:7:50,765
The pair quickly moved
on from phone-jacking for fun


157
0:7:50,765 --> 0:7:54,471
to creating computers,
building the prototype


158
0:7:54,471 --> 0:7:57,748
of the very first Apple.


159
0:7:57,748 --> 0:8:1,258
It's a fond memory
for Steve Wozniak.


160
0:8:1,258 --> 0:8:4,48
He was always thinking
about certain technology,


161
0:8:4,48 --> 0:8:7,188
the early products that got
developed, the building parts,


162
0:8:7,188 --> 0:8:9,391
what those might lead to
in our future,


163
0:8:9,391 --> 0:8:11,12
and he was a always pushing
me as an engineer...


164
0:8:11,12 --> 0:8:12,793
"Could you possibly
add this someday,


165
0:8:12,793 --> 0:8:14,164
could you possibly add
that someday?"


166
0:8:14,164 --> 0:8:15,332
Yes, yes, yes, I could,"


167
0:8:15,332 --> 0:8:17,94
thinking, "no.
It's way, way off,"


168
0:8:17,94 --> 0:8:19,27
but eventually we all did.


169
0:8:19,27 --> 0:8:22,82
In those early days,
Woz and Jobs took their creation


170
0:8:22,82 --> 0:8:25,246
to the home-brew computer club,
an early computer club,


171
0:8:25,246 --> 0:8:28,477
an early computer users' group
in silicon valley,


172
0:8:28,477 --> 0:8:35,333
where it quickly attracted
attention from their peers.


173
0:8:35,333 --> 0:8:39,556
I met both Steves,
Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak


174
0:8:39,556 --> 0:8:42,265
at a meeting
of the home-brew computer club


175
0:8:42,265 --> 0:8:44,463
in Palo Alto.


176
0:8:44,463 --> 0:8:45,764
Our first meeting
was really simple.


177
0:8:45,764 --> 0:8:47,521
It was in the parking lot,


178
0:8:47,521 --> 0:8:50,909
and I helped them
unload Woz's FIAT


179
0:8:50,909 --> 0:8:55,282
and carried in what
I guess was the first Apple I


180
0:8:55,282 --> 0:8:58,9
to show it off
to the assembled multitudes.


181
0:8:58,9 --> 0:9:2,912
When that same first
Apple I was auctioned in 2010,


182
0:9:2,912 --> 0:9:5,283
it attracted
even more attention.


183
0:9:5,283 --> 0:9:8,475
It heralds
the home computing revolution.


184
0:9:8,475 --> 0:9:10,946
This is the first computer
where you use a keyboard


185
0:9:10,946 --> 0:9:14,386
and a screen
to enter and read data.


186
0:9:14,386 --> 0:9:19,821
Selling
for £110,000.


187
0:9:19,821 --> 0:9:23,859
From the hippie days
of 1970s California,


188
0:9:23,859 --> 0:9:26,648
a handful of teenage geeks
emerged to change


189
0:9:26,648 --> 0:9:32,109
how we work, play,
and communicate with each other.


190
0:9:32,109 --> 0:9:34,317
Founders can be
divided into two camps.


191
0:9:34,317 --> 0:9:35,945
There are hippies,
and there are nerds,


192
0:9:35,945 --> 0:9:37,447
and Jobs was definitely
the hippie,


193
0:9:37,447 --> 0:9:38,98
and Woz was the nerd.


194
0:9:38,98 --> 0:9:41,29
And the hippie has
the grand vision,


195
0:9:41,29 --> 0:9:43,461
and the nerd is able
to realize the vision.


196
0:9:43,461 --> 0:9:45,337
The nerd knows everything
about women


197
0:9:45,337 --> 0:9:46,613
but doesn't know any women.


198
0:9:46,613 --> 0:9:49,218
You know,
Steve knew women.


199
0:9:49,218 --> 0:9:51,299
So there's that distinction.


200
0:9:51,299 --> 0:9:53,506
So they really
needed each other.


201
0:9:53,506 --> 0:9:55,7
He knew how to beat it
out of Woz,


202
0:9:55,7 --> 0:9:56,372
and he would do that,


203
0:9:56,372 --> 0:9:59,107
and his contributions
at that time were saying,


204
0:9:59,107 --> 0:10:1,47
"gosh. We could
sell these things."


205
0:10:1,47 --> 0:10:3,54
I mean, which doesn't
sound like much,


206
0:10:3,54 --> 0:10:6,2
but it's huge when you're
dealing with a guy in Woz


207
0:10:6,2 --> 0:10:7,954
who never thought
about selling anything.


208
0:10:7,954 --> 0:10:9,977
I wanted it to happen
so badly,


209
0:10:9,977 --> 0:10:11,519
I gave this computer away.


210
0:10:11,519 --> 0:10:14,188
I gave away the listings,
no copyright notices,


211
0:10:14,188 --> 0:10:16,23
no nothing,
and then Steve Jobs came


212
0:10:16,23 --> 0:10:17,655
and saw the interest,
and he said


213
0:10:17,655 --> 0:10:20,114
"why don't we start
a company to make some money?"


214
0:10:20,114 --> 0:10:21,25
And I said, "fine."


215
0:10:21,25 --> 0:10:23,165
They did want
to start a business.


216
0:10:23,165 --> 0:10:25,432
They raised money to
start a business.


217
0:10:25,432 --> 0:10:27,859
They knew that they couldn't
do it on their own.


218
0:10:27,859 --> 0:10:31,106
They sought out
older people to help,


219
0:10:31,106 --> 0:10:39,8
and Steve Jobs in particular
was quite persuasive.


220
0:10:39,8 --> 0:10:42,617
In Apple's earliest
days, the two Steves,


221
0:10:42,617 --> 0:10:48,51
Jobs and Woz, took on an older
and more experienced partner.


222
0:10:48,51 --> 0:10:52,685
Ronald Wayne now lives
and works near Las Vegas,


223
0:10:52,685 --> 0:10:55,455
a fitting location for
a man who walked away


224
0:10:55,455 --> 0:11:6,893
with nothing from
a $37 billion no-lose bet.


225
0:11:6,893 --> 0:11:9,777
Wayne was invited to discuss
a business proposal


226
0:11:9,777 --> 0:11:12,6
with Jobs and Woz.


227
0:11:12,6 --> 0:11:14,283
That was the first time
I had met Steve Wozniak,


228
0:11:14,283 --> 0:11:17,646
a fascinating guy
a fun guy to be with,


229
0:11:17,646 --> 0:11:20,74
very... not only a fun guy
to be with,


230
0:11:20,74 --> 0:11:22,476
the most gracious man
I've ever met in my life.


231
0:11:22,476 --> 0:11:24,146
As far as Wozniak
was concerned,


232
0:11:24,146 --> 0:11:25,758
the world was
a great big sand box


233
0:11:25,758 --> 0:11:27,955
with a lot of toys
to play with.


234
0:11:27,955 --> 0:11:32,93
But Ron's opinion
of Steve Jobs was not so hot.


235
0:11:32,93 --> 0:11:34,426
I wouldn't put gracious
in his description.


236
0:11:34,426 --> 0:11:39,132
He had the kind of manner,
the kind of approach to people


237
0:11:39,132 --> 0:11:44,3
and environments that
were business directed, ok?


238
0:11:44,3 --> 0:11:48,573
He was extremely serious.


239
0:11:48,573 --> 0:11:51,841
Wayne acted as referee
in a minor difference of opinion


240
0:11:51,841 --> 0:11:55,546
between the two equal partners.


241
0:11:55,546 --> 0:11:58,186
Well, Steve Jobs was
so impressed


242
0:11:58,186 --> 0:12:1,387
with my diplomacy
in that particular situation


243
0:12:1,387 --> 0:12:3,155
that he immediately
came back and said,


244
0:12:3,155 --> 0:12:6,263
"ok. What we're going
to do is form a company,"


245
0:12:6,263 --> 0:12:9,733
with Woz and Jobs
getting 45% each,


246
0:12:9,733 --> 0:12:14,332
and I would get 10%
as a tiebreaker


247
0:12:14,332 --> 0:12:16,505
in the event
of any philosophical disputes


248
0:12:16,505 --> 0:12:18,769
that might occur
in the future.


249
0:12:18,769 --> 0:12:21,743
10% of Apple
today would be worth


250
0:12:21,743 --> 0:12:31,787
$37,631,420,312.42,


251
0:12:31,787 --> 0:12:34,8
but despite his share
in the company,


252
0:12:34,8 --> 0:12:36,852
Ron was worried
that working with Jobs and Woz


253
0:12:36,852 --> 0:12:39,399
might prove to be
too stressful.


254
0:12:39,399 --> 0:12:43,327
At 40, I thought I was getting
a little old for that.


255
0:12:43,327 --> 0:12:45,66
They were absolute whirlwinds.


256
0:12:45,66 --> 0:12:47,665
It was like having
a tiger by the tail.


257
0:12:47,665 --> 0:12:50,274
So Ron decided
to hand back his share


258
0:12:50,274 --> 0:12:55,108
for nothing and walk
away with no regrets.


259
0:12:55,108 --> 0:12:56,848
A lot of people
have the impression


260
0:12:56,848 --> 0:12:58,984
that somehow or other I got
diddled out of something.


261
0:12:58,984 --> 0:13:7,219
Well, I did not.
Nobody diddled me out of anything.


262
0:13:7,219 --> 0:13:8,832
Wayne may not be bitter,


263
0:13:8,832 --> 0:13:11,495
but he wasn't the only
early Apple employee


264
0:13:11,495 --> 0:13:15,29
who made a life decision
most of us would regret.


265
0:13:15,29 --> 0:13:17,939
The funny thing is that
Steve Jobs hired me,


266
0:13:17,939 --> 0:13:23,801
and he said... he had hair just
down to his waist at the time,


267
0:13:23,801 --> 0:13:26,849
and as I recall
he only ate fruit,


268
0:13:26,849 --> 0:13:31,553
and he said,
"we don't have very much loot,


269
0:13:31,553 --> 0:13:35,381
so we'd like to
pay you in stock."


270
0:13:35,381 --> 0:13:41,519
I held out for the cash.


271
0:13:41,519 --> 0:13:44,24
When Steve Jobs
first launched Apple,


272
0:13:44,24 --> 0:13:47,821
the computer industry meant
mainframes and minicomputers.


273
0:13:47,821 --> 0:13:50,631
Huge devices sat
in air conditioned rooms,


274
0:13:50,631 --> 0:13:53,302
and users worked
on terminals.


275
0:13:53,302 --> 0:13:55,963
It wasn't
a personal experience.


276
0:13:55,963 --> 0:13:57,533
The Apple II was
the first computer


277
0:13:57,533 --> 0:14:1,235
that looked like
a consumer electronic device.


278
0:14:1,235 --> 0:14:3,679
It was actually designed,
and they thought


279
0:14:3,679 --> 0:14:4,94
about the user experience


280
0:14:4,94 --> 0:14:7,53
and that it was intended
really to be used


281
0:14:7,53 --> 0:14:10,119
by a single person
in some interactive way


282
0:14:10,119 --> 0:14:15,751
that was enjoyable
to the user, different.


283
0:14:15,751 --> 0:14:18,21
Steve always
thought much more broadly


284
0:14:18,21 --> 0:14:20,55
than just technology.


285
0:14:20,55 --> 0:14:21,922
He was certainly
a techno-visionary,


286
0:14:21,922 --> 0:14:25,604
but the key to his greatness is
to see how broad he thought.


287
0:14:25,604 --> 0:14:29,829
He was obsessed with design,
with elegant design,


288
0:14:29,829 --> 0:14:33,309
and he was obsessed
with the overall experience


289
0:14:33,309 --> 0:14:37,788
of technology and the idea
of creativity generally.


290
0:14:37,788 --> 0:14:41,58
So somehow he was able
to bring these things together


291
0:14:41,58 --> 0:14:45,38
and create technology that
made peoples' eyes light up.


292
0:14:45,38 --> 0:14:49,517
And I wait 8 hours
in a line,


293
0:14:49,517 --> 0:14:54,487
and I'm hungry,
I am everything you imagine,


294
0:14:54,487 --> 0:14:55,56
but I'm happy.


295
0:14:55,56 --> 0:14:57,59
I wait for my iPad


296
0:14:57,59 --> 0:15:0,799
and really, really,
really happy now.


297
0:15:0,799 --> 0:15:3,739
Jobs drew on a diverse
range of influences to feed


298
0:15:3,739 --> 0:15:7,111
his creativity, including
a class he dropped into


299
0:15:7,111 --> 0:15:11,522
at college in Portland, Oregon,
in the early seventies.


300
0:15:11,522 --> 0:15:14,319
Reed college has one
of the best calligraphy courses


301
0:15:14,319 --> 0:15:15,828
in the U.S.


302
0:15:15,828 --> 0:15:18,881
His teacher had a major impact
on his aesthetic


303
0:15:18,881 --> 0:15:26,73
and the clean lines
of his products.


304
0:15:26,73 --> 0:15:28,849
We had many very bright
students here,


305
0:15:28,849 --> 0:15:30,846
d we had bright thinkers


306
0:15:30,846 --> 0:15:32,88
and people that wanted
to change things


307
0:15:32,88 --> 0:15:34,835
and improve the world.


308
0:15:34,835 --> 0:15:36,98
But Palladino
witnessed first hand


309
0:15:36,98 --> 0:15:39,578
the impact Jobs
had on his peers.


310
0:15:39,578 --> 0:15:41,383
The other
students brought him to me


311
0:15:41,383 --> 0:15:45,291
like they were bringing me
someone very special.


312
0:15:45,291 --> 0:15:48,229
They really had
a high regard for him.


313
0:15:48,229 --> 0:15:51,26
I guess they could see
the dynamics


314
0:15:51,26 --> 0:15:55,421
already forming
in his thinking.


315
0:15:55,421 --> 0:15:58,56
Jobs completed
the course in 1974


316
0:15:58,56 --> 0:16:1,75
but returned to palladino
just two years later.


317
0:16:1,75 --> 0:16:3,1
He was enthusing
about a machine he


318
0:16:3,1 --> 0:16:8,62
had created in his garage
and seeking advice on a font.


319
0:16:8,62 --> 0:16:10,573
He was interested in telling
me what he was doing


320
0:16:10,573 --> 0:16:12,709
and how he was using
what he had learned in class,


321
0:16:12,709 --> 0:16:16,821
but he wanted some help
with Greek letters


322
0:16:16,821 --> 0:16:20,116
because he wanted
a Greek font,


323
0:16:20,116 --> 0:16:24,617
and he couldn't find
satisfactory models to go from.


324
0:16:24,617 --> 0:16:28,733
Before Steve started working
on computer typefaces,


325
0:16:28,733 --> 0:16:32,764
they were in very bad condition,
and any improvement


326
0:16:32,764 --> 0:16:35,962
would be a step forward.


327
0:16:35,962 --> 0:16:39,216
The resulting fonts
appeared not just on Macs


328
0:16:39,216 --> 0:16:41,398
but ultimately PCs, too,


329
0:16:41,398 --> 0:16:44,664
dramatically improving
the user experience


330
0:16:44,664 --> 0:16:46,548
but not for Robert.


331
0:16:46,548 --> 0:16:48,11
I never touch computers.


332
0:16:48,11 --> 0:16:51,512
I write everything by hand.


333
0:16:51,512 --> 0:17:3,419
Getting letters in the mail
is getting to be very rare.


334
0:17:3,419 --> 0:17:5,125
Dropping out of college,


335
0:17:5,125 --> 0:17:7,99
Jobs went on the hippie trail,


336
0:17:7,99 --> 0:17:10,6
traveling to India
and studying Buddhism,


337
0:17:10,6 --> 0:17:14,944
this also had an impact
on his work at Apple.


338
0:17:14,944 --> 0:17:18,578
I first met Steve in 1975.


339
0:17:18,578 --> 0:17:20,794
He had recently returned
from India.


340
0:17:20,794 --> 0:17:22,812
He's way ahead of his time.


341
0:17:22,812 --> 0:17:24,821
He wasn't
the typical teenager.


342
0:17:24,821 --> 0:17:28,588
He asked questions that t re
a lot more serious


343
0:17:28,588 --> 0:17:31,425
than the normal 20-year-old.


344
0:17:31,425 --> 0:17:34,333
He was looking to understand
the true nature of things,


345
0:17:34,333 --> 0:17:36,19
and I think he came
to the zen center


346
0:17:36,19 --> 0:17:39,497
Toto continue his search.


347
0:17:39,497 --> 0:17:44,134
Steve was very much taken
with Zen, Zen Buddhism.


348
0:17:44,134 --> 0:17:47,469
Zen represents
the relationship between things,


349
0:17:47,469 --> 0:17:49,135
things of the world.


350
0:17:49,135 --> 0:17:51,517
In zen, it's expressed
in the art.


351
0:17:51,517 --> 0:17:54,12
You see it in flower
arranging, Ikebana,


352
0:17:54,12 --> 0:17:57,86
you see it calligraphy,
you see it in in artworks.


353
0:17:57,86 --> 0:18:0,226
Steve was very much taken
with that


354
0:18:0,226 --> 0:18:1,933
and especially calligraphy.


355
0:18:1,933 --> 0:18:7,45
He noticed the way the lines and
the spaces had a relationship.


356
0:18:7,45 --> 0:18:11,223
I think his genius was being
able to take the principles


357
0:18:11,223 --> 0:18:14,16
of zen and incorporate it
into the products


358
0:18:14,16 --> 0:18:19,548
that came out of Apple.


359
0:18:19,548 --> 0:18:22,832
Jobs freely acknowledged how
these outside influences


360
0:18:22,832 --> 0:18:24,167
had affected him.


361
0:18:24,167 --> 0:18:27,839
He was always trying
to look for external references


362
0:18:27,839 --> 0:18:29,775
and external influences,


363
0:18:29,775 --> 0:18:32,484
and he'd talk about, you know, his
Mercedes was beautifully designed


364
0:18:32,484 --> 0:18:35,519
because those German guys were
thinking beautiful thoughts, I guess.


365
0:18:35,519 --> 0:18:36,681
He loved aphorisms.


366
0:18:36,681 --> 0:18:40,254
You know, Picasso said,
"good artists copy,


367
0:18:40,254 --> 0:18:41,453
great artists steal,"


368
0:18:41,453 --> 0:18:43,294
and he loved to say that.


369
0:18:43,294 --> 0:18:44,527
He was the guy
who came with


370
0:18:44,527 --> 0:18:46,93
"something would be
insanely great."


371
0:18:46,93 --> 0:18:48,762
What does that mean?


372
0:18:48,762 --> 0:18:50,595
Much of what Apple did was built


373
0:18:50,595 --> 0:18:52,761
on the efforts of others.


374
0:18:52,761 --> 0:18:57,667
A 1979 deal gave him access
to Xerox technology,


375
0:18:57,667 --> 0:19:1,711
one thing blew him away,
a prototype mouse.


376
0:19:1,711 --> 0:19:9,974
He gave his own team orders
to make one, only better.


377
0:19:9,974 --> 0:19:12,897
"You got to build it
for less than 15 bucks,


378
0:19:12,897 --> 0:19:15,192
"it's got to last two years,


379
0:19:15,192 --> 0:19:16,958
"I want it to work
on the desktop,


380
0:19:16,958 --> 0:19:19,342
"a normal formica desktop,


381
0:19:19,342 --> 0:19:27,3
and I also want to be able
to use it on my jeans."


382
0:19:27,3 --> 0:19:29,487
As I left the meeting
headed out to my car,


383
0:19:29,487 --> 0:19:32,586
I was thinking,
"does this really make sense?


384
0:19:32,586 --> 0:19:35,904
Is Steve crazy
or is there something here?"


385
0:19:35,904 --> 0:19:37,715
If Steve
wanted something,


386
0:19:37,715 --> 0:19:40,578
his team just had to innovate,


387
0:19:40,578 --> 0:19:43,586
so for dean n at meant a trip
to the drug store.


388
0:19:43,586 --> 0:19:44,752
As I entered Walgreens,


389
0:19:44,752 --> 0:19:47,436
I had in my mind
most importantly was,


390
0:19:47,436 --> 0:19:49,55
"where do I find
these spheres,


391
0:19:49,55 --> 0:19:54,9
these balls to be a part
of the mouse?"


392
0:19:54,9 --> 0:19:56,333
And I had thought
about the underarm deodorant


393
0:19:56,333 --> 0:19:58,261
as the right solution.


394
0:19:58,261 --> 0:20:0,7
And I emerged with some
roll-on deodorant


395
0:20:0,7 --> 0:20:1,408
and a butter dish.


396
0:20:1,408 --> 0:20:3,743
And as you can see here,
there are of course


397
0:20:3,743 --> 0:20:5,468
different sized balls,


398
0:20:5,468 --> 0:20:9,642
depending upon how
it is applied.


399
0:20:9,642 --> 0:20:12,387
Not only that,
but then, once I had the balls,


400
0:20:12,387 --> 0:20:14,488
I said, that's a quick
way to have a structure


401
0:20:14,488 --> 0:20:17,753
to put around the ball so that I
can start interacting with it?"


402
0:20:17,753 --> 0:20:20,932
I remember going to
the house wares area,


403
0:20:20,932 --> 0:20:26,571
and I found a butter dish
which was about this big,


404
0:20:26,571 --> 0:20:28,923
and that became
the beginning part


405
0:20:28,923 --> 0:20:31,507
for the mouse, as I felt it.


406
0:20:31,507 --> 0:20:33,717
So I used the butter dish,
the roll-on ball


407
0:20:33,717 --> 0:20:37,898
and was able to create
a prototype.


408
0:20:37,898 --> 0:20:40,947
It's hard to believe
that in a design so small


409
0:20:40,947 --> 0:20:42,674
as something that fits
in your hand


410
0:20:42,674 --> 0:20:45,242
there could be much
controversy around it,


411
0:20:45,242 --> 0:20:48,378
but it turns out there
was one major controversy,


412
0:20:48,378 --> 0:20:51,311
which was how
many buttons should there be?


413
0:20:51,311 --> 0:20:54,817
The original Xerox PARC
had 3 buttons,


414
0:20:54,817 --> 0:20:57,83
and there was a great debate about
how many buttons were right,


415
0:20:57,83 --> 0:21:3,623
and Steve always had
the notion of simplicity.


416
0:21:3,623 --> 0:21:6,877
The magic of Apple products
is simple.


417
0:21:6,877 --> 0:21:11,197
There was one button,
and it's magic.


418
0:21:11,197 --> 0:21:14,873
From the early days,
one man influenced Steve Jobs


419
0:21:14,873 --> 0:21:24,46
more than any other,
his friend and rival Bill Gates.


420
0:21:24,46 --> 0:21:27,988
Apple's history interweaves
with Microsoft's.


421
0:21:27,988 --> 0:21:30,149
Their CEOs gave
a unique interview


422
0:21:30,149 --> 0:21:32,321
to journalist
Walter Mossberg.


423
0:21:32,321 --> 0:21:34,657
It was
to my knowledge the only time


424
0:21:34,657 --> 0:21:38,13
they ever got onstage
together to submit themselves


425
0:21:38,13 --> 0:21:41,568
to an extended interview
with journalists.


426
0:21:41,568 --> 0:21:44,404
Their interview gave
Walt unparalleled insights


427
0:21:44,404 --> 0:21:47,573
into the dynamics
of their relationship.


428
0:21:47,573 --> 0:21:48,94
But then there was
a floating...


429
0:21:48,94 --> 0:21:50,846
From the start,
Gates was overshadowed


430
0:21:50,846 --> 0:21:54,18
by the more polished,
confident Jobs.


431
0:21:54,18 --> 0:21:55,212
I made... I...


432
0:21:55,212 --> 0:21:59,851
Let me tell the story.
So Woz...


433
0:21:59,851 --> 0:22:5,752
I'm not
fake Steve Jobs.


434
0:22:5,752 --> 0:22:10,123
If you saw them together, Steve
always dominated the conversation.


435
0:22:10,123 --> 0:22:15,341
In part that's because I think Bill
was always fascinated by Steve.


436
0:22:15,341 --> 0:22:20,36
He was a real observer, and he would
just look at this guy and say,


437
0:22:20,36 --> 0:22:21,811
"what the heck
is going on here?"


438
0:22:21,811 --> 0:22:30,25
We've kept our marriage
secret for over a decade now.


439
0:22:30,25 --> 0:22:35,633
He admired Steve for his ability
to interface with people,


440
0:22:35,633 --> 0:22:38,233
connect with them,
you know, affect them.


441
0:22:38,233 --> 0:22:40,76
They were partners,
you know, for a long time.


442
0:22:40,76 --> 0:22:45,467
The very first Apple II computers
had Microsoft software in them.


443
0:22:45,467 --> 0:22:47,933
But while
the banter was good-natured,


444
0:22:47,933 --> 0:22:50,999
the rivalry between the two
was deep-rooted.


445
0:22:50,999 --> 0:22:53,976
I personally can
attest to having heard


446
0:22:53,976 --> 0:22:57,571
each of them say very nasty
things about the other


447
0:22:57,571 --> 0:23:1,252
off the record in private
over the years.


448
0:23:1,252 --> 0:23:5,945
I think the antipathy partly
grew out of two things.


449
0:23:5,945 --> 0:23:10,456
On Jobs' side,
he believed that Microsoft


450
0:23:10,456 --> 0:23:14,205
had stolen
the basic ideas in the Mac.


451
0:23:14,205 --> 0:23:16,123
From the point of view
of Gates, I think,


452
0:23:16,123 --> 0:23:18,359
he found Jobs difficult
to deal with.


453
0:23:18,359 --> 0:23:22,436
Steve is so know
for his restraint.


454
0:23:22,436 --> 0:23:27,168
I think Gates felt
that Jobs got more credit


455
0:23:27,168 --> 0:23:30,74
than he might have deserved
as being the great technologist.


456
0:23:30,74 --> 0:23:34,318
Neither person is
hugely likable.


457
0:23:34,318 --> 0:23:36,459
Certainly Steve Jobs is
an acquired taste,


458
0:23:36,459 --> 0:23:38,45
and so is Bill Gates
for that matter.


459
0:23:38,45 --> 0:23:41,254
Um, they both have
their moments.


460
0:23:41,254 --> 0:23:44,835
Bill Gates is a a better friend
than Steve Jobs,


461
0:23:44,835 --> 0:23:48,67
but Steve Jobs is more
fun than Bill Gates.


462
0:23:48,67 --> 0:23:51,696
Jobs had
glamour and dynamism.


463
0:23:51,696 --> 0:23:54,262
By the mid 1980s,
he was one of the richest


464
0:23:54,262 --> 0:23:56,568
self-made men in America.


465
0:23:56,568 --> 0:23:58,472
He was just 29.


466
0:23:58,472 --> 0:24:0,69
People are going to bring
them home over the weekend


467
0:24:0,69 --> 0:24:2,295
to work on something
Sunday morning.


468
0:24:2,295 --> 0:24:4,44
They're not going to be able to
get their kids away from them,


469
0:24:4,44 --> 0:24:5,749
and maybe someday
they'll even buy a second one


470
0:24:5,749 --> 0:24:7,874
to leave at home.


471
0:24:7,874 --> 0:24:13,717
Which made him
a natural subject for "playboy."


472
0:24:13,717 --> 0:24:15,983
Interviewing Jobs was
a unique experience


473
0:24:15,983 --> 0:24:18,129
for writer David Sheff.


474
0:24:18,129 --> 0:24:19,562
The phone rung one day,


475
0:24:19,562 --> 0:24:21,153
and it was not
a PR person who called,


476
0:24:21,153 --> 0:24:24,728
but it was Jobs himself,
and it really was


477
0:24:24,728 --> 0:24:26,893
an indication of the way
that he did business


478
0:24:26,893 --> 0:24:29,63
and really continued
to do business.


479
0:24:29,63 --> 0:24:31,402
Apple was very different.
The second you walked in the door,


480
0:24:31,402 --> 0:24:34,504
you felt like you were
in a completely new environment.


481
0:24:34,504 --> 0:24:36,574
The conference rooms
instead of, you know,


482
0:24:36,574 --> 0:24:40,342
of number 103c were called
Da Vinci and Michelangelo


483
0:24:40,342 --> 0:24:44,313
and Picasso,
and indeed it was Picasso


484
0:24:44,313 --> 0:24:49,359
that I was escorted to
to see Jobs for the first time.


485
0:24:49,359 --> 0:24:51,291
As the two got
Toto know each other,


486
0:24:51,291 --> 0:24:53,764
Sheff realized he had
a front row seat


487
0:24:53,764 --> 0:24:57,837
on what was then an unimaginable
technological future.


488
0:24:57,837 --> 0:25:0,28
Steve started
drawing on a place mat.


489
0:25:0,28 --> 0:25:2,195
We went back and forth,
and basically by the end


490
0:25:2,195 --> 0:25:6,174
of that constructed what looks
exactly like an iPad.


491
0:25:6,174 --> 0:25:7,811
Steve said this machine,


492
0:25:7,811 --> 0:25:10,481
this small device
as big as a book,


493
0:25:10,481 --> 0:25:13,946
would allow us to keep
in touch with one another,


494
0:25:13,946 --> 0:25:18,45
it will replace the telephone
and would replace bookstores.


495
0:25:18,45 --> 0:25:21,447
He saw it as a reader
on this very small device


496
0:25:21,447 --> 0:25:25,54
and read it with editing
capacity, note-taking capacity.


497
0:25:25,54 --> 0:25:28,27
I mean, he really envisioned
the iPad almost 30 years ago.


498
0:25:28,27 --> 0:25:32,68
Jobs and sheff quickly
became close friends.


499
0:25:32,68 --> 0:25:34,836
Through the late sixties
and seventies


500
0:25:34,836 --> 0:25:38,77
in very similar ways, gong through
some of the counter culture,


501
0:25:38,77 --> 0:25:42,66
you know being, influenced by
some of the eastern mysticism,


502
0:25:42,66 --> 0:25:45,344
buddhism, the LSD culture,
Timothy leary.


503
0:25:45,344 --> 0:25:50,799
Turn on, tune in, rock out.


504
0:25:50,799 --> 0:25:53,381
He was always so excited
about everything,


505
0:25:53,381 --> 0:25:54,448
and we went to movies together,


506
0:25:54,448 --> 0:25:55,62
and we went
to the opera together,


507
0:25:55,62 --> 0:25:56,894
and he could talk
about everything,


508
0:25:56,894 --> 0:26:0,493
and he was this incredibly
giving, loyal friend.


509
0:26:0,493 --> 0:26:2,197
When I was having a hard time,
we'd be on the phone,


510
0:26:2,197 --> 0:26:4,58
he'd drive up
from silicon valley,


511
0:26:4,58 --> 0:26:6,3
take me out to dinner,
hang out,


512
0:26:6,3 --> 0:26:11,971
and take walks with me,
and, um, that's pretty rare.


513
0:26:11,971 --> 0:26:15,809
In 1984, they visited
the home of Yoko Ono


514
0:26:15,809 --> 0:26:18,109
for the ninth birthday party
of Sean,


515
0:26:18,109 --> 0:26:20,448
her son with John Lennon.


516
0:26:20,448 --> 0:26:23,479
Jobs took along a birthday
gift that fascinated


517
0:26:23,479 --> 0:26:28,119
not only Sean but the whole
star-studded guest list.


518
0:26:28,119 --> 0:26:31,118
Steve opened it up,
pulled out what was


519
0:26:31,118 --> 0:26:35,31
one of those first Macintoshes
off the assembly line,


520
0:26:35,31 --> 0:26:36,961
set it up on the floor.


521
0:26:36,961 --> 0:26:39,809
Sean was down on the floor
with him, Steve turned it on,


522
0:26:39,809 --> 0:26:41,43
put macpaint in there.


523
0:26:41,43 --> 0:26:44,74
It took him about two seconds to
show Sean how to deal with it,


524
0:26:44,74 --> 0:26:47,271
and Sean pretty soon
was drawing pictures.


525
0:26:47,271 --> 0:26:49,244
Later Steve told me it was one
of the first times


526
0:26:49,244 --> 0:26:53,484
he'd watched a child
with a Mac.


527
0:26:53,484 --> 0:26:56,415
Eventually I sort of became aware
that there were some people who'd


528
0:26:56,415 --> 0:26:58,144
come in to the room,
and I looked over my shoulder,


529
0:26:58,144 --> 0:27:0,252
and there was Andy warhol.


530
0:27:0,252 --> 0:27:2,764
So there was this great moment
that I'll never forget.


531
0:27:2,764 --> 0:27:6,156
Andy warhol gets down
on his hands and knees


532
0:27:6,156 --> 0:27:8,998
with Sean on one side
and Steve on the other side.


533
0:27:8,998 --> 0:27:11,199
I member that warhol
would pick up the mouse,


534
0:27:11,199 --> 0:27:12,961
and instead of gliding it
along the floor,


535
0:27:12,961 --> 0:27:14,967
the tiled floor
in Sean's bedroom,


536
0:27:14,967 --> 0:27:17,34
he would sort of pick it up
and was trying to figure out


537
0:27:17,34 --> 0:27:19,71
how to make it work,
and Steve very patiently


538
0:27:19,71 --> 0:27:20,467
would sort of lower
his hand down and say,


539
0:27:20,467 --> 0:27:22,8
"no. You kind of push it along."


540
0:27:22,8 --> 0:27:23,784
So Andy sort of
fooled around with it,


541
0:27:23,784 --> 0:27:24,976
and he was
completely mesmerized.


542
0:27:24,976 --> 0:27:26,576
I mean, when he zoned in
on something,


543
0:27:26,576 --> 0:27:27,785
the rest
of the world disappeared,


544
0:27:27,785 --> 0:27:30,387
and that was what it was like
watching warhol


545
0:27:30,387 --> 0:27:32,66
in front of a macintosh
for the first time.


546
0:27:32,66 --> 0:27:35,72
And then he got this big smile
on his face, and he looked up.


547
0:27:35,72 --> 0:27:38,297
He said, "I drew a circle."


548
0:27:38,297 --> 0:27:39,57
And it was great.


549
0:27:39,57 --> 0:27:42,39
Life had been good
for Steve Jobs.


550
0:27:42,39 --> 0:27:44,573
He was worth a million dollars
when he was 21.


551
0:27:44,573 --> 0:27:46,307
He was worth $10 million
when he was 22.


552
0:27:46,307 --> 0:27:49,245
He was worth $100 million
when he was 23 years old.


553
0:27:49,245 --> 0:27:52,251
So he knew nothing but success,
and when you're 23 years old,


554
0:27:52,251 --> 0:27:53,899
you're worth $100 million,


555
0:27:53,899 --> 0:27:56,345
you are pretty damn
full of yourself,


556
0:27:56,345 --> 0:28:4,414
and that's what Steve became,
and so he had huge ambition.


557
0:28:4,414 --> 0:28:7,318
But in 1985
at the age of 30,


558
0:28:7,318 --> 0:28:13,194
his charmed run of luck was
about to come to an abrupt halt.


559
0:28:13,194 --> 0:28:16,689
Seeking someone to help run his
rapidly expanding business,


560
0:28:16,689 --> 0:28:21,307
he hired in Pepsi executive
John Sculley.


561
0:28:21,307 --> 0:28:23,399
President John Sculley
admits Apple will be


562
0:28:23,399 --> 0:28:26,607
just another personal computer
company unless macintosh


563
0:28:26,607 --> 0:28:33,245
becomes an industry milestone
in the n nt 100 days.


564
0:28:33,245 --> 0:28:35,956
There was kind of
a love affair at the beginning.


565
0:28:35,956 --> 0:28:37,848
I mean, Steve
really trusted him


566
0:28:37,848 --> 0:28:40,522
and really saw
a kindred spirit,


567
0:28:40,522 --> 0:28:43,321
someone who would help him
build Apple.


568
0:28:43,321 --> 0:28:44,794
His love was Apple.


569
0:28:44,794 --> 0:28:48,155
He envisioned being
with Apple for his life.


570
0:28:48,155 --> 0:28:50,561
He said, "but that doesn't
mean there won't be periods


571
0:28:50,561 --> 0:28:52,425
"when I will leave
and I will do other things


572
0:28:52,425 --> 0:28:55,531
and my life will
weave in and out of Apple."


573
0:28:55,531 --> 0:28:58,544
Once again,
Jobs' foresight was spot on.


574
0:28:58,544 --> 0:29:1,81
Two years after Sculley
arrived at Apple,


575
0:29:1,81 --> 0:29:5,384
the love affair turned sour
as company profits faltered.


576
0:29:5,384 --> 0:29:8,388
Steve was never
fired from Apple,


577
0:29:8,388 --> 0:29:12,149
but he was ostracized
and demoted


578
0:29:12,149 --> 0:29:16,897
and put in an office
in an empty building,


579
0:29:16,897 --> 0:29:21,124
and after that he...
He resigned in 1985


580
0:29:21,124 --> 0:29:24,207
and then immediately sold his
more than 6 million shares...


581
0:29:24,207 --> 0:29:26,368
He was the largest single
shareholder of Apple at the time,


582
0:29:26,368 --> 0:29:30,619
and sold his stock
at a bad price


583
0:29:30,619 --> 0:29:33,141
and didn't get as much money
as he should have


584
0:29:33,141 --> 0:29:36,174
or could have had he done it
smartly, but he was angry.


585
0:29:36,174 --> 0:29:40,723
He felt so betrayed,
so angry, so disillusioned


586
0:29:40,723 --> 0:29:45,923
that Sculley was, in his mind,
at least part of


587
0:29:45,923 --> 0:29:48,676
if not the ringleader in what
he viewed as a coup


588
0:29:48,676 --> 0:29:52,986
to remove him,
and Steve was pissed off,


589
0:29:52,986 --> 0:29:56,233
and he was really pissed off
about Sculley


590
0:29:56,233 --> 0:29:59,471
because he brought Sculley
in and trusted him


591
0:29:59,471 --> 0:30:2,505
and then felt betrayed by him.


592
0:30:2,505 --> 0:30:6,223
So he sold his stock
and he went off,


593
0:30:6,223 --> 0:30:7,376
took his tens of millions
of dollars


594
0:30:7,376 --> 0:30:9,507
but not hundreds
of millions of dollars


595
0:30:9,507 --> 0:30:12,608
and started a new life.


596
0:30:12,608 --> 0:30:14,644
But there were still
people willing to back him


597
0:30:14,644 --> 0:30:16,311
with hard cash.


598
0:30:16,311 --> 0:30:18,789
One of them was self-made
texan billionaire


599
0:30:18,789 --> 0:30:22,156
and former presidential
candidate Ross Perot.


600
0:30:22,156 --> 0:30:26,163
He saw how wounded Jobs
had been by Apple.


601
0:30:26,163 --> 0:30:30,373
I think at first it was
a tremendous disappointment,


602
0:30:30,373 --> 0:30:32,442
which I can
certainly understand.


603
0:30:32,442 --> 0:30:37,385
Secondly, he picked himself up,
dusted himself off,


604
0:30:37,385 --> 0:30:40,881
and started all over again
with very little hesitation,


605
0:30:40,881 --> 0:30:43,187
and I really admired that.


606
0:30:43,187 --> 0:30:45,659
You know, otherwise you could
sit around in a dark room


607
0:30:45,659 --> 0:30:51,45
and sulk about it,
but that's not Steve.


608
0:30:51,45 --> 0:30:53,801
Steve started
a company called NeXT


609
0:30:53,801 --> 0:30:56,753
to do a computer that was
gonna be what he thought


610
0:30:56,753 --> 0:30:58,603
Apple should have been.


611
0:30:58,603 --> 0:31:1,8
Uh, to aim it at the education
market because they...


612
0:31:1,8 --> 0:31:4,56
Apple had had conspicuous
success in education.


613
0:31:4,56 --> 0:31:5,687
There were some people
he could steal from Apple


614
0:31:5,687 --> 0:31:7,332
to market to that segment,


615
0:31:7,332 --> 0:31:10,501
and he thought
starting small made sense.


616
0:31:10,501 --> 0:31:14,623
But even starting
small needs big money.


617
0:31:14,623 --> 0:31:16,819
I invested $20 millions in NeXT.


618
0:31:16,819 --> 0:31:19,547
He contacted me, asked me
to be a principal investor


619
0:31:19,547 --> 0:31:21,413
and to serve
on the board with him,


620
0:31:21,413 --> 0:31:25,75
and I agreed to do it just
because of my support for him,


621
0:31:25,75 --> 0:31:28,456
and there was no question
in my mind that if he...


622
0:31:28,456 --> 0:31:32,134
If he wanted to do it,
it would get done.


623
0:31:32,134 --> 0:31:34,496
He's great with attracting
and motivating


624
0:31:34,496 --> 0:31:36,105
the best of the best people.


625
0:31:36,105 --> 0:31:39,972
He's great at encouraging
men to be creative


626
0:31:39,972 --> 0:31:43,31
and come up with new ideas
and not just be little robots,


627
0:31:43,31 --> 0:31:46,846
which many big companies just
want you to be a little robot


628
0:31:46,846 --> 0:31:48,751
and do what you're told to do,


629
0:31:48,751 --> 0:31:52,257
and the last thing they want to
hear from you is a creative idea.


630
0:31:52,257 --> 0:31:54,621
Steve loved those
creative ideas,


631
0:31:54,621 --> 0:31:58,495
and that was a magic part
of the success of NeXT.


632
0:31:58,495 --> 0:32:1,631
A new Steve Jobs was
rising out of the ashes


633
0:32:1,631 --> 0:32:3,998
of the boardroom battle
at Apple,


634
0:32:3,998 --> 0:32:9,23
and this time he was ruthless.


635
0:32:9,23 --> 0:32:18,154
He invested $5 million capital
in a corporation called Pixar,


636
0:32:18,154 --> 0:32:23,545
and he took 70% of the company,
and the employees took 30%.


637
0:32:23,545 --> 0:32:28,279
Steve kept investing because
we would run out of money


638
0:32:28,279 --> 0:32:32,657
and he did not want to be
embarrassed by failure


639
0:32:32,657 --> 0:32:34,64
after having been
booted out of Apple,


640
0:32:34,64 --> 0:32:37,294
so he would put more money in


641
0:32:37,294 --> 0:32:39,462
and take more equity away
from the employees.


642
0:32:39,462 --> 0:32:41,491
So over the course
of about 4 or 5 years,


643
0:32:41,491 --> 0:32:43,956
he owned it all.


644
0:32:43,956 --> 0:32:46,114
Alvy quickly
felt he was losing control


645
0:32:46,114 --> 0:32:47,37
to the new master.


646
0:32:47,37 --> 0:32:49,879
I would look at my employees
looking at Steve,


647
0:32:49,879 --> 0:32:51,911
and I realized they're in love.


648
0:32:51,911 --> 0:32:57,85
They're just looking up
at him with big Doe eyes


649
0:32:57,85 --> 0:32:59,826
just soaking in
everything he's saying


650
0:32:59,826 --> 0:33:2,178
as if it was true,
and it wasn't.


651
0:33:2,178 --> 0:33:3,845
So you can see that
it was very disruptive.


652
0:33:3,845 --> 0:33:7,179
Our management style was
to be two hours away from him,


653
0:33:7,179 --> 0:33:11,644
try not to have him come
into the building.


654
0:33:11,644 --> 0:33:14,396
Standing up to Jobs
could be a painful experience,


655
0:33:14,396 --> 0:33:17,825
as Alvy found out in one
memorable boardroom meeting.


656
0:33:17,825 --> 0:33:21,6
He turned on me,
total street bully,


657
0:33:21,6 --> 0:33:23,639
in my face, scream...
We wer... and I went crazy.


658
0:33:23,639 --> 0:33:24,813
I'd never been there.


659
0:33:24,813 --> 0:33:26,77
I don't ever want
to be there again.


660
0:33:26,77 --> 0:33:28,675
That's the reason
I got away from him.


661
0:33:28,675 --> 0:33:31,781
We were screaming
at each other in full bull rage


662
0:33:31,781 --> 0:33:33,849
with our faces
about that far apart,


663
0:33:33,849 --> 0:33:36,2
and during that...
So he was insulting


664
0:33:36,2 --> 0:33:39,23
my southwestern accent.


665
0:33:39,23 --> 0:33:40,691
It was just
street bully stuff.


666
0:33:40,691 --> 0:33:42,656
I ill don't know
what happened.


667
0:33:42,656 --> 0:33:48,761
Something broke.
And during this face-off...


668
0:33:48,761 --> 0:33:50,628
Literally a face-off...


669
0:33:50,628 --> 0:33:53,672
I marched past him
and wrote on the whiteboard.


670
0:33:53,672 --> 0:33:55,341
Now it was
unspoken rule...


671
0:33:55,341 --> 0:33:58,71
Which I hate,
unspoken rules...


672
0:33:58,71 --> 0:34:0,109
That only he could sit
in front of the whiteboard


673
0:34:0,109 --> 0:34:2,51
and only he could use it.


674
0:34:2,51 --> 0:34:4,12
Nobody had ever tested it,


675
0:34:4,12 --> 0:34:6,844
but at this point,
I tested it.


676
0:34:6,844 --> 0:34:8,411
I marched past him
and I wrote on the whiteboard,


677
0:34:8,411 --> 0:34:10,215
and he said,
"y-y-you can't do that.


678
0:34:10,215 --> 0:34:13,121
And I said,
"what? Write on a whiteboard?"


679
0:34:13,121 --> 0:34:15,585
And he stormed out
of the room,


680
0:34:15,585 --> 0:34:18,73
and then I was in shock
for the next week or moths.


681
0:34:18,73 --> 0:34:20,196
I just didn't know
what had happened.


682
0:34:20,196 --> 0:34:23,215
Everyone in Steve Jobs' life
went through 3 phases...


683
0:34:23,215 --> 0:34:28,694
They were either being
seduced, ignored, or scourged,


684
0:34:28,694 --> 0:34:31,612
and it all depended upon
whether he needed you or not.


685
0:34:31,612 --> 0:34:33,617
If he needed you,
he was your best friend,


686
0:34:33,617 --> 0:34:34,982
and he would seduce you,


687
0:34:34,982 --> 0:34:36,581
and then you would work
like a dog,


688
0:34:36,581 --> 0:34:38,722
and if you weren't working hard
enough, he would scourge you,


689
0:34:38,722 --> 0:34:40,259
and ultimately he would
throw you away.


690
0:34:40,259 --> 0:34:42,834
On the personal level,
it was not fun,


691
0:34:42,834 --> 0:34:45,884
it was not the way I want to be
treated by another human being.


692
0:34:45,884 --> 0:34:48,484
Steve ultimately
betrayed everyone.


693
0:34:48,484 --> 0:34:51,283
And some said
the new Steve Jobs wasn't afraid


694
0:34:51,283 --> 0:34:53,519
of claiming
l the credit, too.


695
0:34:53,519 --> 0:34:56,58
Disney took "toy story"
and another one


696
0:34:56,58 --> 0:34:59,362
of their movies to new York
for the critics to see,


697
0:34:59,362 --> 0:35:1,796
and the critics just...
They didn't even look at the other movie.


698
0:35:1,796 --> 0:35:4,508
They just went nuts
when they saw "toy story,"


699
0:35:4,508 --> 0:35:6,539
and they came back
and basically told Steve


700
0:35:6,539 --> 0:35:8,1
that it was going to be
a huge success,


701
0:35:8,1 --> 0:35:11,905
and that's when he... that's
the point his ability to see


702
0:35:11,905 --> 0:35:13,608
something spectacular
is about to happen.


703
0:35:13,608 --> 0:35:16,77
He just moved just in and
exploited that right to the hilt,


704
0:35:16,77 --> 0:35:17,42
and I must say he did
a great job.


705
0:35:17,42 --> 0:35:19,86
He became
a billionaire from it.


706
0:35:19,86 --> 0:35:22,185
Awesome.


707
0:35:22,185 --> 0:35:25,252
So Steve's genius is to move
when he has a good idea.


708
0:35:25,252 --> 0:35:27,588
I don't think they're
necessarily his ideas,


709
0:35:27,588 --> 0:35:28,627
but, boy, does he know
how to move


710
0:35:28,627 --> 0:35:30,22
and market them like crazy.


711
0:35:30,22 --> 0:35:32,699
He the world's
genius marketeer,


712
0:35:32,699 --> 0:35:36,175
including of his own self-image.


713
0:35:36,175 --> 0:35:39,54
But the best
was yet to come for Jobs.


714
0:35:39,54 --> 0:35:41,269
Apple was in trouble.


715
0:35:41,269 --> 0:35:43,236
They wanted him back.


716
0:35:43,236 --> 0:35:45,606
They were begging
him to come back


717
0:35:45,606 --> 0:35:47,653
because they knew
he could fix it,


718
0:35:47,653 --> 0:35:51,727
and he did come back,
and he fixed it,


719
0:35:51,727 --> 0:35:55,802
and the rest is history.


720
0:35:55,802 --> 0:35:58,753
One man who witnessed
Jobs' return to Apple


721
0:35:58,753 --> 0:36:1,42
was friend Walt Mossberg.


722
0:36:1,42 --> 0:36:4,863
He came back to Apple,
and the company was almost dead.


723
0:36:4,863 --> 0:36:8,634
Literally. It was 90 days
from going bankrupt.


724
0:36:8,634 --> 0:36:13,367
He said to the people
at this very demoralized,


725
0:36:13,367 --> 0:36:15,269
almost out of business company,


726
0:36:15,269 --> 0:36:16,837
"we're not looking backward.


727
0:36:16,837 --> 0:36:19,752
"I don't really care
that we once had


728
0:36:19,752 --> 0:36:21,94
"the first successful
personal computer.


729
0:36:21,94 --> 0:36:25,29
"I really don't care that we
were famous and successful.


730
0:36:25,29 --> 0:36:30,416
"We're not anymore, and this
is where we're starting from,


731
0:36:30,416 --> 0:36:31,926
and this is where
we're moving."


732
0:36:31,926 --> 0:36:35,14
And so when you see the second
coming of Steve Jobs and Apple,


733
0:36:35,14 --> 0:36:39,627
Apple went from being
a wide-open and wacky company


734
0:36:39,627 --> 0:36:43,679
to be a very
disciplined company


735
0:36:43,679 --> 0:36:45,45
that understood
its financials


736
0:36:45,45 --> 0:36:47,98
at a level that
few companies do.


737
0:36:47,98 --> 0:36:50,252
That's because Steve thought
of every dollar


738
0:36:50,252 --> 0:36:51,956
as being his every dollar.


739
0:36:51,956 --> 0:36:55,52
They have resolved these
differences in a very, very...


740
0:36:55,52 --> 0:36:57,421
It was an investment
from Bill Gates


741
0:36:57,421 --> 0:36:59,945
that ultimately helped
to save Apple,


742
0:36:59,945 --> 0:37:2,18
but when Gates made
a a live appearance with Jobs


743
0:37:2,18 --> 0:37:4,992
to explain the deal,
it didn't go down well


744
0:37:4,992 --> 0:37:11,261
with the loyal
Apple audience.


745
0:37:11,261 --> 0:37:17,71
Bill Gates was actually onstage
rescuing Apple, rescuing Apple.


746
0:37:17,71 --> 0:37:18,768
He did two things.


747
0:37:18,768 --> 0:37:22,314
He gave them $150 million
for which he got


748
0:37:22,314 --> 0:37:24,915
nonvoting stock
that expired


749
0:37:24,915 --> 0:37:27,98
after a certain
number of years,


750
0:37:27,98 --> 0:37:31,917
and he promised to
keep producing Microsoft office,


751
0:37:31,917 --> 0:37:36,384
the macintosh version,
for, I think, 5 years,


752
0:37:36,384 --> 0:37:39,586
and so he was onstage
rescuing Apple,


753
0:37:39,586 --> 0:37:45,499
and yet the acolytes
who were filling the room


754
0:37:45,499 --> 0:37:46,901
had learned to hate him.


755
0:37:46,901 --> 0:37:50,113
They treated him as,
you know the, devil,


756
0:37:50,113 --> 0:37:56,139
the antichrist,
and they booed him.


757
0:37:56,139 --> 0:37:58,549
But Jobs with his eye
ever on the bottom line,


758
0:37:58,549 --> 0:37:59,98
had a different view.


759
0:37:59,98 --> 0:38:1,606
There were too many
people at Apple


760
0:38:1,606 --> 0:38:3,883
and in the Apple ecosystem
playing the game of


761
0:38:3,883 --> 0:38:6,489
"for Apple to win,
Microsoft has to lose,"


762
0:38:6,489 --> 0:38:10,484
and it was clear that you
didn't have to play that game


763
0:38:10,484 --> 0:38:12,194
because Apple wasn't
going to beat Microsoft.


764
0:38:12,194 --> 0:38:13,518
Apple didn't have
to beat Microsoft.


765
0:38:13,518 --> 0:38:16,602
Apple had to remember
who Apple was.


766
0:38:16,602 --> 0:38:18,632
It was just crazy what
was happening that time,


767
0:38:18,632 --> 0:38:22,561
and Apple as very weak,
and so I called Bill up


768
0:38:22,561 --> 0:38:24,203
and we tried
to patch things up.


769
0:38:24,203 --> 0:38:27,14
I think he learned to be
a better businessman.


770
0:38:27,14 --> 0:38:29,575
I think he learned
a little more humility.


771
0:38:29,575 --> 0:38:31,61
Steve really changed
in a number of ways,


772
0:38:31,61 --> 0:38:36,414
and he changed primarily
because of failure.


773
0:38:36,414 --> 0:38:38,881
Failure affected him,
and he learned from.


774
0:38:38,881 --> 0:38:43,72
Jobs created a brand-new
product at Apple, the iMac.


775
0:38:43,72 --> 0:38:46,427
I think there was
a decision to look different.


776
0:38:46,427 --> 0:38:51,9
Remember, their motto immediately after
his return was "think different,"


777
0:38:51,9 --> 0:38:55,667
and he didn't say that
because he didn't believe it.


778
0:38:55,667 --> 0:38:57,164
He really did want
to think different,


779
0:38:57,164 --> 0:38:59,15
and they would have to
appear different


780
0:38:59,15 --> 0:39:1,643
to show that they
were thinking different.


781
0:39:1,643 --> 0:39:3,837
The pair joked about
the relationship


782
0:39:3,837 --> 0:39:11,545
between "Mac Man" Jobs
and "PC Man" Bill Gates.


783
0:39:11,545 --> 0:39:17,857
PC guy is great
but not a big heart.


784
0:39:17,857 --> 0:39:19,26
His mother
loves him.


785
0:39:19,26 --> 0:39:22,793
His mother
loves him.


786
0:39:22,793 --> 0:39:26,432
PC guy is what makes it
all work actually.


787
0:39:26,432 --> 0:39:29,161
All right.


788
0:39:29,161 --> 0:39:30,503
It's worth
thinking about.


789
0:39:30,503 --> 0:39:34,551
The truth about Bill Gates
is a brilliant man


790
0:39:34,551 --> 0:39:40,517
who you could... and I did talk to
for long periods about the future.


791
0:39:40,517 --> 0:39:42,992
He could think
quite intelligently


792
0:39:42,992 --> 0:39:45,756
about the future,
but the way Microsoft worked


793
0:39:45,756 --> 0:39:49,725
as a business was far more
incremental than Apple.


794
0:39:49,725 --> 0:39:53,39
All the while, they were
working on some big leap,


795
0:39:53,39 --> 0:39:57,194
and Microsoft tended
to do the incremental stuff


796
0:39:57,194 --> 0:39:58,595
almost all the time.


797
0:39:58,595 --> 0:40:1,294
What's Steve's done
is quite phenomenal.


798
0:40:1,294 --> 0:40:4,34
His ability to
always come around


799
0:40:4,34 --> 0:40:7,5
and figure out where
that next bet should be


800
0:40:7,5 --> 0:40:8,902
has been phenomenal.


801
0:40:8,902 --> 0:40:11,27
Apple literally
was failing


802
0:40:11,27 --> 0:40:13,278
when Steve went back
and re-infused


803
0:40:13,278 --> 0:40:17,677
the innovation
and risk-taking


804
0:40:17,677 --> 0:40:19,317
that have been
phenomenal.


805
0:40:19,317 --> 0:40:23,559
So the industry has benefited
immensely from his work.


806
0:40:23,559 --> 0:40:26,567
We've both been lucky
to be part of it,


807
0:40:26,567 --> 0:40:29,592
but I'd say he's contributed
as much as anyone.


808
0:40:29,592 --> 0:40:30,967
I think he built the
first software company


809
0:40:30,967 --> 0:40:33,792
before anybody
really in our industry


810
0:40:33,792 --> 0:40:35,535
knew what
a software company was


811
0:40:35,535 --> 0:40:38,841
except for these guys
and that was huge.


812
0:40:38,841 --> 0:40:41,16
Bill Gates is a brilliant man.


813
0:40:41,16 --> 0:40:44,218
He did a lot
for the world in technology.


814
0:40:44,218 --> 0:40:46,779
And he is now doing a lot
for the world in philanthropy,


815
0:40:46,779 --> 0:40:49,723
and I think highly
of Bill Gates,


816
0:40:49,723 --> 0:40:54,387
but...Of the two of them,


817
0:40:54,387 --> 0:40:57,859
the one that took
the bigger risks


818
0:40:57,859 --> 0:41:0,97
and changed the game more often,
it was Steve...


819
0:41:0,97 --> 0:41:2,26
It was Steve Jobs.


820
0:41:2,26 --> 0:41:6,358
I'd give a lot to have
Steve Jobs' taste.


821
0:41:6,358 --> 0:41:9,239
He has natural...


822
0:41:9,239 --> 0:41:10,862
It's not a joke
at all.


823
0:41:10,862 --> 0:41:12,505
I think in terms
of intuitive taste


824
0:41:12,505 --> 0:41:14,609
both for people
and products,


825
0:41:14,609 --> 0:41:17,479
the way he does things
is just different,


826
0:41:17,479 --> 0:41:20,52
and I think
it's magical.


827
0:41:20,52 --> 0:41:23,551
Despite their rivalry,
in this joint appearance


828
0:41:23,551 --> 0:41:26,51
after Jobs had been
diagnosed with cancer,


829
0:41:26,51 --> 0:41:27,951
they displayed
a healthy respect


830
0:41:27,951 --> 0:41:31,154
and even affection
for one another.


831
0:41:31,154 --> 0:41:33,461
I think of most things
in life as either


832
0:41:33,461 --> 0:41:35,287
a Bob Dylan
or Beatles song,


833
0:41:35,287 --> 0:41:38,958
but there's that one line
in that one Beatles song,


834
0:41:38,958 --> 0:41:40,901
"you and I have memories
longer than the road


835
0:41:40,901 --> 0:41:42,36
that stretches out ahead,"


836
0:41:42,36 --> 0:41:45,701
and that's clearly
true here.


837
0:41:45,701 --> 0:41:46,91
That's sweet


838
0:41:46,91 --> 0:41:48,478
I think we should
end it there.


839
0:41:48,478 --> 0:41:50,452
It was one of the highlights


840
0:41:50,452 --> 0:41:53,306
of my journalistic career
to be there.


841
0:41:53,306 --> 0:41:54,414
Thank you very much


842
0:41:54,414 --> 0:41:58,784
Thank you
so much.


843
0:41:58,784 --> 0:42:0,917
In fact,
we were quite taken aback


844
0:42:0,917 --> 0:42:4,12
by the standing ovation
and seeing some of the people


845
0:42:4,12 --> 0:42:7,554
from where we were sitting
onstage actually shedding tears.


846
0:42:7,554 --> 0:42:11,1
It sounds strange, but it was
actually an emotional thing.


847
0:42:11,1 --> 0:42:16,535
So I can move this with just
a touch anywhere I want.


848
0:42:16,535 --> 0:42:19,976
Steve Jobs, now at the peak
of his creative genius,


849
0:42:19,976 --> 0:42:25,676
was leading Apple to the peak
of its creative success.


850
0:42:25,676 --> 0:42:27,379
The key to the success
of the company


851
0:42:27,379 --> 0:42:29,893
was in moving
beyond the computer,


852
0:42:29,893 --> 0:42:33,288
was in seeing how
the microprocessor


853
0:42:33,288 --> 0:42:35,317
was getting so cheap
that it could be applied


854
0:42:35,317 --> 0:42:40,562
to other consumer
electronic devices.


855
0:42:40,562 --> 0:42:42,361
Innovative
new products poured


856
0:42:42,361 --> 0:42:44,94
in a seemingly endless stream


857
0:42:44,94 --> 0:42:47,393
from Apple's
development laboratories,


858
0:42:47,393 --> 0:42:51,169
pouring a stream of cash
into Apple's coffers.


859
0:42:51,169 --> 0:42:55,48
250 million or a billion or
however many iPods are out there


860
0:42:55,48 --> 0:42:59,542
are what built
the Apple of today, not the Mac.


861
0:42:59,542 --> 0:43:1,245
Approaching
the age of 50,


862
0:43:1,245 --> 0:43:3,555
barely a quarter
of a century after making


863
0:43:3,555 --> 0:43:11,756
his first million greenbacks,
Jobs was worth $2.3 billion.


864
0:43:11,756 --> 0:43:15,79
Now he picked up the pace
of Apple's evolution.


865
0:43:15,79 --> 0:43:19,496
Computers?
They were yesterday's news.


866
0:43:19,496 --> 0:43:22,595
He was conquering
the world of music.


867
0:43:22,595 --> 0:43:24,299
Great new products.


868
0:43:24,299 --> 0:43:28,136
Jobs was hurting
his competitors.


869
0:43:28,136 --> 0:43:32,918
iTunes pretty well killed off
the music store,


870
0:43:32,918 --> 0:43:35,919
and virgin mega-stores,
you know, have slowly


871
0:43:35,919 --> 0:43:40,718
been disappearing
around the world.


872
0:43:40,718 --> 0:43:43,51
Half a million songs
are downloaded


873
0:43:43,51 --> 0:43:46,419
on iTunes every day,


874
0:43:46,419 --> 0:43:52,16
in many cases
changing artists' lives.


875
0:43:52,16 --> 0:43:54,994
Hip-hop group
the black eyed peas were asked


876
0:43:54,994 --> 0:43:58,34
to star
in an iTunes commercial.


877
0:43:58,34 --> 0:44:2,977
They later became the most
downloaded band on iTunes,


878
0:44:2,977 --> 0:44:5,478
but at the time,
they didn't understand


879
0:44:5,478 --> 0:44:7,515
this new cultural phenomenon.


880
0:44:7,515 --> 0:44:10,621
They said, "hey. They want to
use a black eyed peas song


881
0:44:10,621 --> 0:44:13,816
for an iTunes commercial,"


882
0:44:13,816 --> 0:44:16,916
and I said what's iTunes?"


883
0:44:16,916 --> 0:44:20,77
And they said,
"they're not paying much,


884
0:44:20,77 --> 0:44:23,759
but they're going to
give you guys iPods."


885
0:44:23,759 --> 0:44:24,802
"What's an iPod?"


886
0:44:24,802 --> 0:44:29,807
This is the new iPod Nano.


887
0:44:29,807 --> 0:44:32,38
But Jobs' influence
on the music industry


888
0:44:32,38 --> 0:44:35,349
went far beyond
simple star making.


889
0:44:35,349 --> 0:44:38,816
Way before iTunes,
Steve Jobs has been


890
0:44:38,816 --> 0:44:41,982
a part of music because
every major studio


891
0:44:41,982 --> 0:44:45,146
has a Mac computer in it.


892
0:44:45,146 --> 0:44:49,52
I mean, the Mac computer is
an artist's computer.


893
0:44:49,52 --> 0:44:51,519
Musicians
are still important,


894
0:44:51,519 --> 0:44:53,486
but people like Steve Jobs
are uber, uberimportant.


895
0:44:53,486 --> 0:44:56,326
They bought CDs,
and they want to buy downloads.


896
0:44:56,326 --> 0:44:58,859
People don't want
to rent their music


897
0:44:58,859 --> 0:45:0,897
Life in Apple's orchard


898
0:45:0,897 --> 0:45:5,599
had never been more fruitful.


899
0:45:5,599 --> 0:45:16,18
Then Steve Jobs
learned he had cancer.


900
0:45:16,18 --> 0:45:19,266
A standing ovation
for Apple ceo Steve Jobs


901
0:45:19,266 --> 0:45:21,89
as he greeted the public
for the first time


902
0:45:21,89 --> 0:45:22,896
in more than a year.


903
0:45:22,896 --> 0:45:27,125
He carried on working,
but the years that followed


904
0:45:27,125 --> 0:45:31,62
were a roller coaster
of hope and despair.


905
0:45:31,62 --> 0:45:33,302
Most poignantly he
was asked


906
0:45:33,302 --> 0:45:37,64
what the next few years
might hold.


907
0:45:37,64 --> 0:45:38,834
The future is long.


908
0:45:38,834 --> 0:45:42,768
Ha ha ha!


909
0:45:42,768 --> 0:45:50,75
The last few years have reminded
me that life is fragile


910
0:45:50,75 --> 0:45:56,114
um, you know...


911
0:45:56,114 --> 0:45:59,994
Finally he
withdrew from public life.


912
0:45:59,994 --> 0:46:2,697
Only his closest friends saw
how he was coping


913
0:46:2,697 --> 0:46:11,963
with the threat
of an early death.


914
0:46:11,963 --> 0:46:13,732
Steve Jobs loved
to take walks.


915
0:46:13,732 --> 0:46:15,906
He did a lot of his thinking
and his talking


916
0:46:15,906 --> 0:46:19,779
with his close friends
like Larry Ellison


917
0:46:19,779 --> 0:46:22,16
and a number of other people
that he was friendly with


918
0:46:22,16 --> 0:46:23,55
in silicon valley,
and he would go


919
0:46:23,55 --> 0:46:27,515
on these long walks sometimes
around Palo Alto,


920
0:46:27,515 --> 0:46:31,23
where he lived,
and sometimes in other places.


921
0:46:31,23 --> 0:46:34,292
It just was his preferred
method of thinking


922
0:46:34,292 --> 0:46:37,705
and daydreaming ideas
with people.


923
0:46:37,705 --> 0:46:41,363
One day I was out
in silicon valley.


924
0:46:41,363 --> 0:46:44,697
He found out about it,
and he conveyed to me


925
0:46:44,697 --> 0:46:47,5
that he would like me
to come over to his house,


926
0:46:47,5 --> 0:46:51,107
and this was just after
his liver transplant,


927
0:46:51,107 --> 0:46:53,41
which as we all know is
a very serious kind of thing


928
0:46:53,41 --> 0:46:54,675
that takes
a lot of recovery,


929
0:46:54,675 --> 0:46:55,79
and he wanted me to come over


930
0:46:55,79 --> 0:46:59,494
and just talk
about industry gossip


931
0:46:59,494 --> 0:47:2,214
in a way or events
that had gone on


932
0:47:2,214 --> 0:47:5,217
since he'd been
kind of out of action.


933
0:47:5,217 --> 0:47:6,689
He was very frail.


934
0:47:6,689 --> 0:47:9,191
We talked about his health,


935
0:47:9,191 --> 0:47:12,164
and he talked about how
he felt he was recovering,


936
0:47:12,164 --> 0:47:16,1
and in the middle of this,
he said, "let's go for a walk,"


937
0:47:16,1 --> 0:47:19,732
and I said, "really? Really?
You're sure you want


938
0:47:19,732 --> 0:47:21,766
to go for a walk?"


939
0:47:21,766 --> 0:47:24,669
We're about halfway
to the neighborhood park,


940
0:47:24,669 --> 0:47:25,809
and he stops, you kn..


941
0:47:25,809 --> 0:47:28,775
He wasn't gasping for air
or anything,


942
0:47:28,775 --> 0:47:30,475
but he was not
well-looking man,


943
0:47:30,475 --> 0:47:35,93
and I said, "Steve, why don't
we go back to the house?"


944
0:47:35,93 --> 0:47:38,925
And he smiled or chuckled,
and he said,


945
0:47:38,925 --> 0:47:41,25
"no. We're not going
back to the house.


946
0:47:41,25 --> 0:47:43,637
"I just need a minute and then
we're gonna go on to the park


947
0:47:43,637 --> 0:47:45,196
"because that's my goal.


948
0:47:45,196 --> 0:47:47,337
"I set a goal every day,
and my goal now


949
0:47:47,337 --> 0:47:49,427
is to get to this park."


950
0:47:49,427 --> 0:47:51,865
I said, "you're sure?"
And he said, "yeah."


951
0:47:51,865 --> 0:47:55,402
So we walked to the park,
and, you know, he was fine.


952
0:47:55,402 --> 0:47:56,904
We talked by the way
the whole way.


953
0:47:56,904 --> 0:47:58,872
We were dog
what he does on walks,


954
0:47:58,872 --> 0:48:1,207
which is we were talking
about different things,


955
0:48:1,207 --> 0:48:4,588
and we got to the park,
and we sat on a bench,


956
0:48:4,588 --> 0:48:7,219
and we talked about...
In the park,


957
0:48:7,219 --> 0:48:9,12
if I remember correctly,
we actually talked


958
0:48:9,12 --> 0:48:12,217
more about life and health
and... you know,


959
0:48:12,217 --> 0:48:14,829
I had had a heart attack
some years before,


960
0:48:14,829 --> 0:48:17,597
and he was lecturing me
about that,


961
0:48:17,597 --> 0:48:20,1
and I was sort of
lecturing him, as well,


962
0:48:20,1 --> 0:48:22,567
about work/life balance
and all these things,


963
0:48:22,567 --> 0:48:24,305
and then we got up
and walked back


964
0:48:24,305 --> 0:48:28,338
and talked some more.


965
0:48:28,338 --> 0:48:33,112
And the last thing
he said to me was


966
0:48:33,112 --> 0:48:34,492
"you know, Walt,
you and I have been


967
0:48:34,492 --> 0:48:38,821
"through lots of adventures
over the last 15 years,


968
0:48:38,821 --> 0:48:42,986
and we're going to have some
more adventures to come."


969
0:48:42,986 --> 0:48:50,921
We never did.


970
0:48:50,921 --> 0:48:58,132
On October 5, 2011,
Steve Jobs died.


971
0:48:58,132 --> 0:49:0,734
The next day, his closest
friend and colleague


972
0:49:0,734 --> 0:49:4,674
Steve Wozniak paid
his own tribute.


973
0:49:4,674 --> 0:49:7,38
I'm going to miss
the chance to go to him


974
0:49:7,38 --> 0:49:14,624
and just sit down and share
just person to person.


975
0:49:14,624 --> 0:49:17,822
How much fun we had... ohh...


976
0:49:17,822 --> 0:49:19,518
How much fun we had
in those days


977
0:49:19,518 --> 0:49:21,593
doing things together.


978
0:49:21,593 --> 0:49:24,7
You lose it,
you can't ever go back


979
0:49:24,7 --> 0:49:27,964
and just have those
conversations


980
0:49:27,964 --> 0:49:42,142
that make us both smile.


981
0:49:42,142 --> 0:49:45,364
As the world mourned,
the most fitting tribute


982
0:49:45,364 --> 0:49:48,482
came from one
of Steve Jobs' young fans.


983
0:49:48,482 --> 0:49:51,717
19-year-old Hong Kong-based
design student


984
0:49:51,717 --> 0:49:53,752
Jonathan Mak Long
created an image


985
0:49:53,752 --> 0:49:59,877
on his Mac that went viral
around the world.


986
0:49:59,877 --> 0:50:1,606
There was no real
research behind it.


987
0:50:1,606 --> 0:50:3,597
I just messed around
on my computer,


988
0:50:3,597 --> 0:50:5,497
and it just happened.


989
0:50:5,497 --> 0:50:7,93
It made sense to incorporate
his silhouette,


990
0:50:7,93 --> 0:50:10,735
his profile into the logo.


991
0:50:10,735 --> 0:50:14,542
It's gotten around
200,000 responses on my blog.


992
0:50:14,542 --> 0:50:16,68
Some people have said to me
that the logo actually


993
0:50:16,68 --> 0:50:18,613
made them cry,
and I thought it was


994
0:50:18,613 --> 0:50:20,118
a really strong
reaction to have,


995
0:50:20,118 --> 0:50:22,563
but it made sense
because Steve Jobs


996
0:50:22,563 --> 0:50:28,29
had such a great impact
on our world.


997
0:50:28,29 --> 0:50:31,231
He wasn't just this person who
made all these great gadgets.


998
0:50:31,231 --> 0:50:38,97
He actually changed
the that way we communicate.


999
0:50:38,97 --> 0:50:40,866
When you grow up,
you tend to get told


1000
0:50:40,866 --> 0:50:45,51
that the world is the way it is
and your life


1001
0:50:45,51 --> 0:50:47,675
is just to live
your life inside the world,


1002
0:50:47,675 --> 0:50:50,543
try not to bash into
the walls too much,


1003
0:50:50,543 --> 0:50:53,385
try to have a nice
family life, have fun,


1004
0:50:53,385 --> 0:50:56,887
save a little money.


1005
0:50:56,887 --> 0:51:0,596
How amazing is it that we live
in an era where his legacy


1006
0:51:0,596 --> 0:51:5,607
will transform people's lives
and experiences of technology


1007
0:51:5,607 --> 0:51:7,741
for the foreseeable future?


1008
0:51:7,741 --> 0:51:12,13
This single individual
gave us the original Apple,


1009
0:51:12,13 --> 0:51:14,245
the macintosh, and Pixar


1010
0:51:14,245 --> 0:51:18,275
and the iPod
and the iPhone, iPad.


1011
0:51:18,275 --> 0:51:23,982
That is astonishing.


1012
0:51:23,982 --> 0:51:28,232
Steve Jobs created the most
respected brand in the world


1013
0:51:28,232 --> 0:51:31,887
and shook up
a whole industry,


1014
0:51:31,887 --> 0:51:37,36
and he did it with a lot
of panache and style,


1015
0:51:37,36 --> 0:51:42,93
and, you know, great respect
for him for it.


1016
0:51:42,93 --> 0:51:44,234
Life can be much broader


1017
0:51:44,234 --> 0:51:46,64
once you discover
one simple fact,


1018
0:51:46,64 --> 0:51:49,779
and that is everything
around you that you call life


1019
0:51:49,779 --> 0:51:54,75
was made up by people that
were no smarter than you.


1020
0:51:54,75 --> 0:51:56,78
The facts are
the story of his life,


1021
0:51:56,78 --> 0:51:57,962
the story of his successes,
the story of his achievements,


1022
0:51:57,962 --> 0:52:1,658
the stories
of the great things he did


1023
0:52:1,658 --> 0:52:6,172
for other people
continue to go on because


1024
0:52:6,172 --> 0:52:7,925
that's good
for our country,


1025
0:52:7,925 --> 0:52:10,433
it's good for the nation,
it's good for the world,


1026
0:52:10,433 --> 0:52:12,795
and it's also good
for the people.


1027
0:52:12,795 --> 0:52:14,262
Of course, that's
what it's all about.


1028
0:52:14,262 --> 0:52:16,938
I think the world
will miss Steve Jobs.


1029
0:52:16,938 --> 0:52:18,896
He took stuff
to a new place,


1030
0:52:18,896 --> 0:52:20,302
and I do identify with that.


1031
0:52:20,302 --> 0:52:21,432
It's exciting when you do that,


1032
0:52:21,432 --> 0:52:23,8
so I do find
the excitement of that,


1033
0:52:23,8 --> 0:52:25,272
and he also made things
that were beautiful,


1034
0:52:25,272 --> 0:52:27,91
great to touch, great to hold,
good to look at,


1035
0:52:27,91 --> 0:52:29,74
and different colors.


1036
0:52:29,74 --> 0:52:31,616
The minute you understand
that you can poke life


1037
0:52:31,616 --> 0:52:33,114
and actually something will...


1038
0:52:33,114 --> 0:52:34,679
You know, if you push in,
something will pop out


1039
0:52:34,679 --> 0:52:37,322
the other side,
you can you can change it,


1040
0:52:37,322 --> 0:52:38,916
you can mold it,


1041
0:52:38,916 --> 0:52:48,696
um, that's the most
important thing.


1042
0:52:48,696 --> 0:52:52,28
There's one thing
on which everyone agrees...


1043
0:52:52,28 --> 0:52:57,56
Steve Jobs left a legacy
that has changed the world.


1044
0:52:57,56 --> 0:52:59,802
He had the ability
to think up new ways


1045
0:52:59,802 --> 0:53:2,329
of doing things,
not just improve what we have,


1046
0:53:2,329 --> 0:53:3,623
do a better version
of something,


1047
0:53:3,623 --> 0:53:5,73
but do it in a totally
different way


1048
0:53:5,73 --> 0:53:14,138
that the world would
swing towards.


1049
0:53:14,138 --> 0:53:18,16
And so we fall in love
with Steve because he gave us


1050
0:53:18,16 --> 0:53:28,434
these toys that were not only
fun but really useful. Wow!


1051
0:53:28,434 --> 0:53:31,613
It's upended industry
after industry,


1052
0:53:31,613 --> 0:53:36,576
it's forced everyone
else to follow in his path,


1053
0:53:36,576 --> 0:53:40,13
and it has touched
billions of people.


1054
0:53:40,13 --> 0:53:43,597
He will be regarded
as the person who unlocked


1055
0:53:43,597 --> 0:53:47,161
the creativity
of a whole generation.


1056
0:53:47,161 --> 0:53:53,1
He's changed the way we look
at computers, phones,


1057
0:53:53,1 --> 0:53:54,636
how we share, interact.


1058
0:53:54,636 --> 0:53:57,808
He's going to inspire
a whole new generation.


1059
0:53:57,808 --> 0:54:2,373
A 5-year-old 20 years from now
is going to create and design


1060
0:54:2,373 --> 0:54:6,55
and invent and define a world
totally different


1061
0:54:6,55 --> 0:54:8,683
than the way we see it now,


1062
0:54:8,683 --> 0:54:11,756
and it's going to be
because of Steve Jobs.


1063
0:54:11,756 --> 0:54:13,803
Even then he had
this ability to bridge


1064
0:54:13,803 --> 0:54:16,982
a very intellectual world
of high technology


1065
0:54:16,982 --> 0:54:30,442
with something
that everyone could relate to.


1066
0:54:30,442 --> 0:54:34,306
Here's a guy who revolutionized
the computer industry,


1067
0:54:34,306 --> 0:54:39,743
the music industry,
the motion picture industry,


1068
0:54:39,743 --> 0:54:43,545
the telephone industry...
There's 4...


1069
0:54:43,545 --> 0:54:45,317
And maybe more,
I don't know,


1070
0:54:45,317 --> 0:54:47,749
but certainly those 4,


1071
0:54:47,749 --> 0:54:52,659
and if you compare him
with Edison,


1072
0:54:52,659 --> 0:54:56,92
well, there was
the electric power industry,


1073
0:54:56,92 --> 0:54:59,463
the motion picture industry,
and the music industry.


1074
0:54:59,463 --> 0:55:3,768
Edison only had 3.


1075
0:55:3,768 --> 0:55:12,16
That's impact.
