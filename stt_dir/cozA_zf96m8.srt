1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:5,6



2
0:0:5,6 --> 0:0:7,37
MALE SPEAKER 1: I'm pretty
excited about the Olympics.


3
0:0:7,37 --> 0:0:8,5
MALE SPEAKER 2: A moment
in history which


4
0:0:8,5 --> 0:0:9,21
will never be repeated.


5
0:0:9,21 --> 0:0:11,145
FEMALE SPEAKER 1: There's
nowhere else in the world that


6
0:0:11,145 --> 0:0:11,995
could do it justice.


7
0:0:11,995 --> 0:0:13,98
FEMALE SPEAKER 2: I'm not sure
that people who are angry


8
0:0:13,98 --> 0:0:16,15
about the Olympics would
be very patriotic.


9
0:0:16,15 --> 0:0:17,1
MALE SPEAKER 3: I think
there's a lot of


10
0:0:17,1 --> 0:0:17,792
dissatisfaction.


11
0:0:17,792 --> 0:0:19,63
MALE SPEAKER 4: It's a complete
overkill for what is


12
0:0:19,63 --> 0:0:20,56
a sporting event.


13
0:0:20,56 --> 0:0:22,68
FEMALE SPEAKER 2: The Olympics
is not about politics.


14
0:0:22,68 --> 0:0:25,97



15
0:0:25,97 --> 0:0:28,61
MALE SPEAKER 5: We're seeing
the biggest mobilization of


16
0:0:28,61 --> 0:0:31,17
troops in the UK since the
end of World War II.


17
0:0:31,17 --> 0:0:32,97
FEMALE SPEAKER 3: Do Londoners
feel safer?


18
0:0:32,97 --> 0:0:35,3
We've now got drones coming
in over the sky.


19
0:0:35,3 --> 0:0:37,61
MALE SPEAKER 6: I'm not afraid
of the army or the police.


20
0:0:37,61 --> 0:0:39,6
The longer you're out,
the better it is.


21
0:0:39,6 --> 0:0:40,24
MALE SPEAKER 7: There's
going to be a


22
0:0:40,24 --> 0:0:42,61
threat of an alien invasion.


23
0:0:42,61 --> 0:0:44,75
The whole area could be sealed
off in a heartbeat.


24
0:0:44,75 --> 0:0:46,96
And then effectively it becomes
a concentration camp.


25
0:0:46,96 --> 0:0:49,42
MALE SPEAKER 4: The security's
predominantly about defending


26
0:0:49,42 --> 0:0:50,41
the interests of the sponsors.


27
0:0:50,41 --> 0:0:52,76
MALE SPEAKER 8: Instead of a
park for the people, we've


28
0:0:52,76 --> 0:0:56,8
actually created a toxic
wilderness for a corporate


29
0:0:56,8 --> 0:0:56,77
sports day.


30
0:0:56,77 --> 0:0:58,22
MALE SPEAKER 9: We should
have a right to


31
0:0:58,22 --> 0:0:59,45
hang around our area.


32
0:0:59,45 --> 0:1:1,16
FEMALE SPEAKER 4: We're
a community.


33
0:1:1,16 --> 0:1:2,17
This is my home.


34
0:1:2,17 --> 0:1:4,519
And I don't see why we should
be kicked out of it.


35
0:1:4,519 --> 0:1:5,79
MALE SPEAKER 10: We're going
to have a lot of rather


36
0:1:5,79 --> 0:1:8,34
useless, rather empty buildings
left in Stratford.


37
0:1:8,34 --> 0:1:10,485
MALE SPEAKER 11: The London I
knew really is dead and gone.


38
0:1:10,485 --> 0:1:11,735
MALE SPEAKER 12: That's
a bit extreme.


39
0:1:11,735 --> 0:3:11,735
