1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:3,592



2
0:0:3,592 --> 0:0:5,72
THOMAS: It's the gift
booth, right?


3
0:0:5,72 --> 0:0:7,435
Or the accessories booth?


4
0:0:7,435 --> 0:0:9,19
CHRISTOPHE: The leatherman
booth.


5
0:0:9,19 --> 0:0:11,694
THOMAS: It's a working elevator


6
0:0:11,694 --> 0:0:13,512
here inside The Eagle.


7
0:0:13,512 --> 0:0:14,762
Oh, wow.


8
0:0:14,762 --> 0:0:26,28



9
0:0:26,28 --> 0:0:28,3
Leathermen used to be the
deepest, darkest mystery that


10
0:0:28,3 --> 0:0:30,43
the gay subculture had.


11
0:0:30,43 --> 0:0:33,7
The sex lives and drug intake of
these tough homos made even


12
0:0:33,7 --> 0:0:35,78
the rowdiest, straight Hell's
Angels look like pussies.


13
0:0:35,78 --> 0:0:38,157
They were like a gang of
butt-fucking werewolves.


14
0:0:38,157 --> 0:0:41,2
CHRISTOPHE: Splits your balls,
your left and your right.


15
0:0:41,2 --> 0:0:42,75
THOMAS: When AIDS came on the
scene, the leathermen were


16
0:0:42,75 --> 0:0:44,35
right on the firing line.


17
0:0:44,35 --> 0:0:46,83
Today, catching one in full
regalia outside the small


18
0:0:46,83 --> 0:0:49,19
handful of leather clubs that
remain is like spotting a


19
0:0:49,19 --> 0:0:50,47
leprechaun.


20
0:0:50,47 --> 0:0:52,99
Fearing that they may soon be
totally extinct, I decided to


21
0:0:52,99 --> 0:0:55,27
dive head first into
their world.


22
0:0:55,27 --> 0:0:57,58
The last of the great New York
leather bars is The Eagle, so


23
0:0:57,58 --> 0:0:59,8
I started my quest there.


24
0:0:59,8 --> 0:1:2,12
Luckily, I soon met the best
guy I could have hoped for.


25
0:1:2,12 --> 0:1:3,88
Christophe Andre is a long-time
leatherman.


26
0:1:3,88 --> 0:1:5,53
And he was the winner
of last year's Mr.


27
0:1:5,53 --> 0:1:6,61
Eagle beauty pageant.


28
0:1:6,61 --> 0:1:8,78
He also sells handcuffs
and dildos in an


29
0:1:8,78 --> 0:1:10,76
elevator at the bar.


30
0:1:10,76 --> 0:1:15,605
CHRISTOPHE: So that's $287.74.


31
0:1:15,605 --> 0:1:18,4
Do you want a bag for this?


32
0:1:18,4 --> 0:1:23,52
Now what happens tonight is
tonight we call Code on


33
0:1:23,52 --> 0:1:24,664
Thursdays at The Eagle.


34
0:1:24,664 --> 0:1:25,66
THOMAS: OK.


35
0:1:25,66 --> 0:1:26,224
I think I saw that sign.


36
0:1:26,224 --> 0:1:29,662
CHRISTOPHE: And basically what
we try to encourage here is


37
0:1:29,662 --> 0:1:33,49
for men to come in in leather
gear, all leather gear, as


38
0:1:33,49 --> 0:1:34,89
much as possible.


39
0:1:34,89 --> 0:1:37,95
We encourage no running shoes.


40
0:1:37,95 --> 0:1:42,59
We encourage no dress shoes or
suits, ties, dress shirts,


41
0:1:42,59 --> 0:1:46,69
polo shirts, and definitely
no cologne.


42
0:1:46,69 --> 0:1:47,2
THOMAS: Why?


43
0:1:47,2 --> 0:1:47,89
CHRISTOPHE: Gay men do
not like cologne.


44
0:1:47,89 --> 0:1:48,45
THOMAS: No?


45
0:1:48,45 --> 0:1:50,97
CHRISTOPHE: No, we like the
natural smell of a man.


46
0:1:50,97 --> 0:1:56,76
THOMAS: Is that enforced under
punishment of expulsion if you


47
0:1:56,76 --> 0:1:59,62
catch somebody with cologne
who sneaks in?


48
0:1:59,62 --> 0:2:0,83
They're out.


49
0:2:0,83 --> 0:2:2,949
CHRISTOPHE: So the only thing
that I will do for you is just


50
0:2:2,949 --> 0:2:5,66
give you that leatherman
look, a little crease.


51
0:2:5,66 --> 0:2:9,34
Just kind of fold you up
here a little bit.


52
0:2:9,34 --> 0:2:10,39
THOMAS: Nice and flabby.


53
0:2:10,39 --> 0:2:11,367
CHRISTOPHE: Make you look
a little more relaxed.


54
0:2:11,367 --> 0:2:12,617
THOMAS: Nice [INAUDIBLE].


55
0:2:12,617 --> 0:2:15,352



56
0:2:15,352 --> 0:2:16,81
CHRISTOPHE: There you go.


57
0:2:16,81 --> 0:2:18,79
THOMAS: The leather scene
supposedly started with guys


58
0:2:18,79 --> 0:2:20,72
coming home from World War
II who missed all the


59
0:2:20,72 --> 0:2:24,2
freewheeling sex and bro-ing
down the army provided.


60
0:2:24,2 --> 0:2:26,18
As a result, a big military
vibe runs


61
0:2:26,18 --> 0:2:28,2
through the whole scene.


62
0:2:28,2 --> 0:2:30,8
That baker hat they all wear was
swiped from the Nazis, as


63
0:2:30,8 --> 0:2:34,48
was a lot of other gear, like
jack boots and riding crops.


64
0:2:34,48 --> 0:2:36,78
On my first night in The Eagle,
I saw a couple dressed


65
0:2:36,78 --> 0:2:38,97
completely like biker cops.


66
0:2:38,97 --> 0:2:41,45
CHRISTOPHE: I spoke to you
guys about this before.


67
0:2:41,45 --> 0:2:42,893
This is the current Mr. Eagle.


68
0:2:42,893 --> 0:2:44,336
This is Rick Weber.


69
0:2:44,336 --> 0:2:47,703
So he's Mr. Eagle,
the year 2007.


70
0:2:47,703 --> 0:2:50,98
This is Thomas from
Vice magazine.


71
0:2:50,98 --> 0:2:51,96
THOMAS: Pleasure to meet you.


72
0:2:51,96 --> 0:2:52,94
RICK: Nice meeting you.


73
0:2:52,94 --> 0:2:54,9
CHRISTOPHE: And the
camera man.


74
0:2:54,9 --> 0:2:57,35
This is Matthew.


75
0:2:57,35 --> 0:2:58,33
This is Rick Weber.


76
0:2:58,33 --> 0:3:1,29
[LAUGHTER]


77
0:3:1,29 --> 0:3:3,64
THOMAS: Since grooming is so
vital, a lot a leather bars


78
0:3:3,64 --> 0:3:5,96
have their own house barbers.


79
0:3:5,96 --> 0:3:8,54
This is Jake, The
Eagle's barber.


80
0:3:8,54 --> 0:3:11,63
The second he saw me he said,
I can't wait to get rid of


81
0:3:11,63 --> 0:3:14,68
that little Harry Potter
thing you've got going.


82
0:3:14,68 --> 0:3:16,98
He was hands down the scariest
fag I'd never met.


83
0:3:16,98 --> 0:3:18,4
So I said all right.


84
0:3:18,4 --> 0:3:21,78
I have to hold this mic up to my
mouth because it's loud as


85
0:3:21,78 --> 0:3:23,78
shit in here.


86
0:3:23,78 --> 0:3:26,35
So we're over in the
barber's corner.


87
0:3:26,35 --> 0:3:32,88
There's some pretty heavy guy
on guy on harness with guys


88
0:3:32,88 --> 0:3:37,22
around him action going on on
a screen above the bar.


89
0:3:37,22 --> 0:3:39,14
I've been watching, people
have got wrist


90
0:3:39,14 --> 0:3:42,19
and arm bands on.


91
0:3:42,19 --> 0:3:45,695
And I'm going to ask Christophe
in a little while


92
0:3:45,695 --> 0:3:47,78
if this stuff about left
and right arm is


93
0:3:47,78 --> 0:3:49,48
really adhered to.


94
0:3:49,48 --> 0:3:51,31
They fetishized the living
shit out of the


95
0:3:51,31 --> 0:3:53,9
whole haircut process.


96
0:3:53,9 --> 0:3:54,96
They've got an actual barber's
chair in one


97
0:3:54,96 --> 0:3:56,61
corner of the room.


98
0:3:56,61 --> 0:3:59,95
All the products they use are
these 1950s era old man


99
0:3:59,95 --> 0:4:2,26
things, like pomade
and talcum powder.


100
0:4:2,26 --> 0:4:3,76
And they keep the chair
facing the dick


101
0:4:3,76 --> 0:4:5,21
porn to keep you hard.


102
0:4:5,21 --> 0:4:6,77
The whole thing's
a production.


103
0:4:6,77 --> 0:4:9,47
Over the course of my shave,
I was slapped in the head,


104
0:4:9,47 --> 0:4:11,55
kissed on the neck, and
gingerly humped.


105
0:4:11,55 --> 0:4:14,95
All while Jake assured me that
he was taking it easy on me.


106
0:4:14,95 --> 0:4:16,97
I guess this is the leather
equivalent of watching the big


107
0:4:16,97 --> 0:4:20,22
game in a La-Z-Boy while being
serviced by Hooters girls.


108
0:4:20,22 --> 0:4:21,94
CHRISTOPHE: Look at you!


109
0:4:21,94 --> 0:4:22,64
THOMAS: New person.


110
0:4:22,64 --> 0:4:23,52
MALE SPEAKER: My god!


111
0:4:23,52 --> 0:4:24,33
CHRISTOPHE: Look at you.


112
0:4:24,33 --> 0:4:27,144
THOMAS: I'm now getting showered
with adulation for


113
0:4:27,144 --> 0:4:28,626
having sat through a haircut.


114
0:4:28,626 --> 0:4:30,108
MALE SPEAKER: It's beautiful!


115
0:4:30,108 --> 0:4:31,96
CHRISTOPHE: You're a new man.


116
0:4:31,96 --> 0:4:33,72
MALE SPEAKER: Jake is
a great barber.


117
0:4:33,72 --> 0:4:36,54
CHRISTOPHE: Have you
looked in a mirror?


118
0:4:36,54 --> 0:4:38,93
This new hair will get you
a lot of attention.


119
0:4:38,93 --> 0:4:39,265
THOMAS: Oh, yeah?


120
0:4:39,265 --> 0:4:41,27
CHRISTOPHE: Yeah, I think so.


121
0:4:41,27 --> 0:4:44,256
THOMAS: Getting back to my
question about the arm bands.


122
0:4:44,256 --> 0:4:46,5
CHRISTOPHE: You know, flagging
is not done as much anymore.


123
0:4:46,5 --> 0:4:48,15
And it's something that
you see very little


124
0:4:48,15 --> 0:4:49,54
of now in New York.


125
0:4:49,54 --> 0:4:53,19
You see, it started out, I
believe, in San Francisco.


126
0:4:53,19 --> 0:4:55,11
But you really don't see
it as much in New York.


127
0:4:55,11 --> 0:4:57,14
So anyone that wants
to flag whatever


128
0:4:57,14 --> 0:4:58,94
they're in the mood for.


129
0:4:58,94 --> 0:5:4,3
So anything that's on the left
pocket, or the arm, or the


130
0:5:4,3 --> 0:5:7,13
wrist indicates usually
that you're a top.


131
0:5:7,13 --> 0:5:8,85
You're the dominant
of the two.


132
0:5:8,85 --> 0:5:9,81
THOMAS: You're giving it.


133
0:5:9,81 --> 0:5:10,302
CHRISTOPHE: Right.


134
0:5:10,302 --> 0:5:13,28
Anyone that has it on the
right means they want to


135
0:5:13,28 --> 0:5:14,6
receive it.


136
0:5:14,6 --> 0:5:16,28
Some of them are very
common sense.


137
0:5:16,28 --> 0:5:18,94
Yellow, you kind of know
what that means.


138
0:5:18,94 --> 0:5:20,204
It's piss.


139
0:5:20,204 --> 0:5:22,561
Red is fisting.


140
0:5:22,561 --> 0:5:27,255
The light blue here is
cocksucker or cock-suckee.


141
0:5:27,255 --> 0:5:29,29
THOMAS: Can I ask what
the other colors are?


142
0:5:29,29 --> 0:5:30,114
CHRISTOPHE: OK, sure.


143
0:5:30,114 --> 0:5:30,526
THOMAS: [INAUDIBLE].


144
0:5:30,526 --> 0:5:33,1
What's after light blue,
if it's cocksucker?


145
0:5:33,1 --> 0:5:33,76
CHRISTOPHE: So we did these.


146
0:5:33,76 --> 0:5:36,91
So that's fisting,
piss, cocksucker.


147
0:5:36,91 --> 0:5:40,18
There is the navy blue, which
is just basic fucking.


148
0:5:40,18 --> 0:5:44,9
Black is S&M. Pink--


149
0:5:44,9 --> 0:5:47,586
what do you think
pink might be?


150
0:5:47,586 --> 0:5:48,77
THOMAS: Dresses?


151
0:5:48,77 --> 0:5:50,532
I don't know, transvestites?


152
0:5:50,532 --> 0:5:51,8
CHRISTOPHE: No, toys.


153
0:5:51,8 --> 0:5:52,2
THOMAS: Toys!


154
0:5:52,2 --> 0:5:53,644
OK, that makes sense.


155
0:5:53,644 --> 0:5:55,4
CHRISTOPHE: Toys.


156
0:5:55,4 --> 0:5:55,64
Brown--


157
0:5:55,64 --> 0:5:57,76
I don't even think I want
to even discuss brown.


158
0:5:57,76 --> 0:5:59,1
THOMAS: That's fine.


159
0:5:59,1 --> 0:6:1,688



160
0:6:1,688 --> 0:6:3,66
CHRISTOPHE: Oh, we
got a cab, yes!


161
0:6:3,66 --> 0:6:4,31
And a big one.


162
0:6:4,31 --> 0:6:6,7
Just the ones I like.


163
0:6:6,7 --> 0:6:7,9
THOMAS: We went home and got
a couple hours of sleep.


164
0:6:7,9 --> 0:6:10,4
Then I had to go help Christophe
move his bike for


165
0:6:10,4 --> 0:6:11,88
the street sweeper.


166
0:6:11,88 --> 0:6:14,6
So we're back in Christophe's
apartment.


167
0:6:14,6 --> 0:6:16,67
So far the leather community
doesn't seem too bad.


168
0:6:16,67 --> 0:6:20,8
Due to fair warning, I didn't
venture into the upstairs


169
0:6:20,8 --> 0:6:23,8
bathrooms, where supposedly
a lot of the action is.


170
0:6:23,8 --> 0:6:28,62
The one thing everybody bought
and, like, one after the other


171
0:6:28,62 --> 0:6:32,96
sliding in was the amyl
nitrate poppers.


172
0:6:32,96 --> 0:6:38,6
I think it's just, like, kind
of a concentrated stimulant,


173
0:6:38,6 --> 0:6:38,81
or something.


174
0:6:38,81 --> 0:6:41,84
I thought it was supposed
to relax your ass.


175
0:6:41,84 --> 0:6:45,1
But he was saying that most
commonly use it just right


176
0:6:45,1 --> 0:6:46,9
before getting in the sack.


177
0:6:46,9 --> 0:6:48,72
Or I don't know if
they have a sack.


178
0:6:48,72 --> 0:6:50,49
I'm really not sure what
it does, actually.


179
0:6:50,49 --> 0:6:55,95
We'll give that a shot when
the mood is right.


180
0:6:55,95 --> 0:7:0,93
Eager to see what that
scene's all about.


181
0:7:0,93 --> 0:7:2,37
We're back at Code
night again.


182
0:7:2,37 --> 0:7:4,77
I'm actually dressed
to code tonight.


183
0:7:4,77 --> 0:7:6,9
The shirt's a little blousie.


184
0:7:6,9 --> 0:7:8,765
Now that we've been introduced
to the scene, I think we'll


185
0:7:8,765 --> 0:7:10,193
just cut back and enjoy the--


186
0:7:10,193 --> 0:7:13,9



187
0:7:13,9 --> 0:7:15,14
I don't know what it would be
called, the fringe benefits?


188
0:7:15,14 --> 0:7:16,24
It's not even that.


189
0:7:16,24 --> 0:7:17,26
CHRISTOPHE: [LAUGHS].


190
0:7:17,26 --> 0:7:18,642
Enjoy some things.


191
0:7:18,642 --> 0:7:20,55
Well, this is a collar.


192
0:7:20,55 --> 0:7:22,89
You know, basically
what a collar can


193
0:7:22,89 --> 0:7:24,38
stand for, many things.


194
0:7:24,38 --> 0:7:29,18
Someone gets collared, they're
a boy, they're a slave.


195
0:7:29,18 --> 0:7:34,0
It really identifies with
being more submissive, a


196
0:7:34,0 --> 0:7:36,892
bottom, maybe [INAUDIBLE]
a submissive boy.


197
0:7:36,892 --> 0:7:39,98
These are what we call
a ball stretcher.


198
0:7:39,98 --> 0:7:41,3
Your balls come through.


199
0:7:41,3 --> 0:7:42,295
THOMAS: They go through that?


200
0:7:42,295 --> 0:7:44,5
How much are those?


201
0:7:44,5 --> 0:7:46,201
CHRISTOPHE: It's a range
from $12 and up.


202
0:7:46,201 --> 0:7:47,404
THOMAS: Can I try that one on?


203
0:7:47,404 --> 0:7:50,29
I guess I'd have to figure
out my size, wouldn't I?


204
0:7:50,29 --> 0:7:52,214
CHRISTOPHE: Well, we
start at one inch.


205
0:7:52,214 --> 0:7:53,657
THOMAS: Oh, OK.


206
0:7:53,657 --> 0:7:55,581
CHRISTOPHE: And they're
not easy to get on.


207
0:7:55,581 --> 0:7:57,14
Some guys can get them
on really quickly.


208
0:7:57,14 --> 0:7:59,82
Some guys you need to
really struggle.


209
0:7:59,82 --> 0:8:2,802
So it's a matter of just
taking this like this.


210
0:8:2,802 --> 0:8:4,79
And just kind of--


211
0:8:4,79 --> 0:8:5,287
THOMAS: Dropping them in.


212
0:8:5,287 --> 0:8:6,281
CHRISTOPHE: --popping them in.


213
0:8:6,281 --> 0:8:9,263
As soon as you've got them in,
you're able just to pull out


214
0:8:9,263 --> 0:8:11,251
and push this up that way.


215
0:8:11,251 --> 0:8:16,221



216
0:8:16,221 --> 0:8:17,215
I may have to help you.


217
0:8:17,215 --> 0:8:18,706
[INTERPOSING VOICES]


218
0:8:18,706 --> 0:8:22,682
THOMAS: Oh, and now I'll
drop in like that?


219
0:8:22,682 --> 0:8:24,67
OK, and then you let go?


220
0:8:24,67 --> 0:8:25,664
Wow!


221
0:8:25,664 --> 0:8:27,652
Oh, that's funny.


222
0:8:27,652 --> 0:8:28,646
CHRISTOPHE: It can hurt.


223
0:8:28,646 --> 0:8:30,137
THOMAS: It's not bad, though.


224
0:8:30,137 --> 0:8:33,119
Do you want a shot of my
disgusting looking balls in


225
0:8:33,119 --> 0:8:35,604
this thing?


226
0:8:35,604 --> 0:8:36,349
MATTHEW: [INAUDIBLE]


227
0:8:36,349 --> 0:8:37,95
new frontiers here.


228
0:8:37,95 --> 0:8:39,935
THOMAS: I don't know if you
can show that or not.


229
0:8:39,935 --> 0:8:41,74
And so you just wear
this around?


230
0:8:41,74 --> 0:8:45,435
CHRISTOPHE: You can wear this
around the entire day.


231
0:8:45,435 --> 0:8:47,91
So let's say you're
going to be--


232
0:8:47,91 --> 0:8:53,85



233
0:8:53,85 --> 0:8:55,335
you choose your pocket.


234
0:8:55,335 --> 0:8:56,82
THOMAS: All right.


235
0:8:56,82 --> 0:8:58,34
Christophe helped me get
fully geared up.


236
0:8:58,34 --> 0:9:1,6
And finally, I was ready to
experience the leather world


237
0:9:1,6 --> 0:9:2,8
as a leatherman.


238
0:9:2,8 --> 0:9:6,16
First stop, the fabled
upstairs bathroom.


239
0:9:6,16 --> 0:9:8,46
I'll see how it turns out.


240
0:9:8,46 --> 0:9:10,65
How do I get there?


241
0:9:10,65 --> 0:9:11,9
CHRISTOPHE: That way.


242
0:9:11,9 --> 0:9:15,463



243
0:9:15,463 --> 0:9:16,713
THOMAS: [WHISTLES].


244
0:9:16,713 --> 0:9:18,956



245
0:9:18,956 --> 0:9:25,443
So it's an intense scene
in that bathroom.


246
0:9:25,443 --> 0:9:28,437



247
0:9:28,437 --> 0:9:32,262
Jake had previously told me
[INAUDIBLE] urinals, kind of


248
0:9:32,262 --> 0:9:34,425
with a wall in between them.


249
0:9:34,425 --> 0:9:39,415
And then once the wall stopped
around here, like chest level,


250
0:9:39,415 --> 0:9:40,662
it was chain-linked fence.


251
0:9:40,662 --> 0:9:44,3
And you were standing across
from people kind of pissing at


252
0:9:44,3 --> 0:9:44,405
the same time.


253
0:9:44,405 --> 0:9:47,648
What they didn't tell me is that
pissing here usually may


254
0:9:47,648 --> 0:9:51,391
mean having some guy go down
on you while another guy's


255
0:9:51,391 --> 0:9:53,387
getting butt-fucked
right next to you.


256
0:9:53,387 --> 0:9:55,882
But it's pretty Roman.


257
0:9:55,882 --> 0:9:59,375
And it smelled genuinely
unique.


258
0:9:59,375 --> 0:10:2,369



259
0:10:2,369 --> 0:10:5,862
I couldn't begin to describe
the elements I assume are


260
0:10:5,862 --> 0:10:8,856
going into that aroma.


261
0:10:8,856 --> 0:10:14,2
Shit, piss, and tile cleaner
being only three of many.


262
0:10:14,2 --> 0:10:16,27
I decided to go up to the roof
to cool off and get a


263
0:10:16,27 --> 0:10:18,25
little fresh air.


264
0:10:18,25 --> 0:10:21,17
We just came up to the
roof, which is kind


265
0:10:21,17 --> 0:10:22,77
of the cigar lounge.


266
0:10:22,77 --> 0:10:27,44
And there's some dudes, like,
maybe 10 yards that way.


267
0:10:27,44 --> 0:10:30,52
When we got up here and walked
down, one of them was going


268
0:10:30,52 --> 0:10:31,26
down on the other.


269
0:10:31,26 --> 0:10:32,48
And now they're just fucking.


270
0:10:32,48 --> 0:10:34,6
[CHUCKLES].


271
0:10:34,6 --> 0:10:35,4
It's kind of empty otherwise.


272
0:10:35,4 --> 0:10:39,9
It's like a nice little smoker's
lounge, or whatever,


273
0:10:39,9 --> 0:10:40,45
cigar area.


274
0:10:40,45 --> 0:10:44,13
And they're just totally
going at it.


275
0:10:44,13 --> 0:10:47,32
You know, I really had a lot
of fun with the leathermen.


276
0:10:47,32 --> 0:10:50,62
All the weird rules, the fancy
clothes, the butt grabbing and


277
0:10:50,62 --> 0:10:53,25
close contact and camaraderie.


278
0:10:53,25 --> 0:10:55,91
It was like being in a secret
club for tough guys.


279
0:10:55,91 --> 0:10:59,181
At the same time, though, it
never got me hard or made me


280
0:10:59,181 --> 0:11:2,29
want to fuck any of the guys
I was hanging out with.


281
0:11:2,29 --> 0:11:5,9
So I guess there's this sort of
disconnect there between me


282
0:11:5,9 --> 0:11:9,36
and the folks who are really
into it and get off on being


283
0:11:9,36 --> 0:11:11,96
tied up, whipped.


284
0:11:11,96 --> 0:11:15,76
In any case, dudes know
how to party.


285
0:11:15,76 --> 0:11:15,539
Ah!


286
0:11:15,539 --> 0:11:16,465
[LAUGHS].


287
0:11:16,465 --> 0:11:16,928
Oh, no, no.


288
0:11:16,928 --> 0:11:18,317
[INAUDIBLE].


289
0:11:18,317 --> 0:11:19,65
CHRISTOPHE: He's a wimp!


290
0:11:19,65 --> 0:11:22,16
THOMAS: I've got
sensitive nips.


291
0:11:22,16 --> 0:11:23,41
There we go.


292
0:11:23,41 --> 0:13:23,41
