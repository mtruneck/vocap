0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:0,99
[MUSIC PLAYING]


2
0:0:0,99 --> 0:0:3,96
I have this propensity to
want to crush things.


3
0:0:3,96 --> 0:0:5,445
So I want to show you what this
demonstration looks like.


4
0:0:5,445 --> 0:0:6,8
[POPPING SOUNDS]


5
0:0:6,8 --> 0:0:9,13
Let's do the same thing that we
just did, but this time the


6
0:0:9,13 --> 0:0:9,81
can is a little bit bigger.


7
0:0:9,81 --> 0:0:11,284
[EXPLODING SOUND]


8
0:0:11,284 --> 0:0:12,19
Bam!


9
0:0:12,19 --> 0:0:14,237
So I bet you think this is the
part of the show where I'm


10
0:0:14,237 --> 0:0:16,8
going to say, don't try these
experiments at home.


11
0:0:16,8 --> 0:0:17,69
And you're right.


12
0:0:17,69 --> 0:0:20,57
Except there is one experiment
we want you to try.


13
0:0:20,57 --> 0:0:21,7
Just look for the graphic
that's right here


14
0:0:21,7 --> 0:0:22,86
that says, Try It.


15
0:0:22,86 --> 0:0:24,75
That's your signal that
you can try that


16
0:0:24,75 --> 0:0:25,76
experiment at home.


17
0:0:25,76 --> 0:0:27,395
Everything else, off limits.


18
0:0:27,395 --> 0:0:29,51
Look, I've already given you
homework, and the show hasn't


19
0:0:29,51 --> 0:0:30,76
even started.


20
0:0:30,76 --> 0:0:33,9



21
0:0:33,9 --> 0:0:37,23
Well, this is the answer to the
age-old question, what do


22
0:0:37,23 --> 0:0:38,41
you do to crush that can?


23
0:0:38,41 --> 0:0:40,313
Because of course, you
don't want to just


24
0:0:40,313 --> 0:0:42,31
sit here and do this.


25
0:0:42,31 --> 0:0:43,96
Expends so much energy.


26
0:0:43,96 --> 0:0:47,36
Why wouldn't you want to have
this entire set up here just


27
0:0:47,36 --> 0:0:49,85
to accomplish the same thing.


28
0:0:49,85 --> 0:0:51,32
But there's nothing really
cool about that.


29
0:0:51,32 --> 0:0:54,77
All right, so let's see if we
can do it a different way.


30
0:0:54,77 --> 0:0:57,35
So here's what we have, is
we have three cans here.


31
0:0:57,35 --> 0:1:0,2
In each of the cans, I have
a small amount of water.


32
0:1:0,2 --> 0:1:2,45
Now, you could do this on a
burner if you wanted to.


33
0:1:2,45 --> 0:1:4,56
In this particular case, because
we're portable, we


34
0:1:4,56 --> 0:1:6,96
have this little camping
stove thing.


35
0:1:6,96 --> 0:1:8,21
And so now, let's
turn this on.


36
0:1:8,21 --> 0:1:10,82



37
0:1:10,82 --> 0:1:14,19
So the object here is this, is
we want to boil that water.


38
0:1:14,19 --> 0:1:17,54
So when you boil the water in
the can, water when it boils,


39
0:1:17,54 --> 0:1:19,5
goes from a liquid into a gas.


40
0:1:19,5 --> 0:1:21,62
And when it does that, those
little water molecules move


41
0:1:21,62 --> 0:1:24,69
about 1,700 times farther
away from each other


42
0:1:24,69 --> 0:1:25,89
than they were before.


43
0:1:25,89 --> 0:1:28,14
In essence, we're turning
it into water vapor.


44
0:1:28,14 --> 0:1:29,62
And you can see a little
of the water vapor


45
0:1:29,62 --> 0:1:31,27
starting out here.


46
0:1:31,27 --> 0:1:33,26
What we're really trying
to do is to push the


47
0:1:33,26 --> 0:1:34,28
air out of the can.


48
0:1:34,28 --> 0:1:36,72
This is a demonstration
in air pressure.


49
0:1:36,72 --> 0:1:38,88
There's air pushing all
around the can.


50
0:1:38,88 --> 0:1:42,94
If we're at sea level, it's 14.7
pounds per square inch.


51
0:1:42,94 --> 0:1:44,26
It's pushing all over the can.


52
0:1:44,26 --> 0:1:47,79
What we want, is we want to
evacuate the can from the air,


53
0:1:47,79 --> 0:1:50,11
just leaving the water vapor.


54
0:1:50,11 --> 0:1:51,59
This is hot now, it's a gas.


55
0:1:51,59 --> 0:1:54,26
If we could cool it down very
quickly by turning it upside


56
0:1:54,26 --> 0:1:56,8
down and putting it into water
there, we might be able to


57
0:1:56,8 --> 0:1:58,67
allow the air pressure
to crush the can.


58
0:1:58,67 --> 0:2:0,21
So, here's what happens.


59
0:2:0,21 --> 0:2:2,6
I'm going to grab my gloves so
I can just kind of pick it up


60
0:2:2,6 --> 0:2:4,24
and hold onto it.


61
0:2:4,24 --> 0:2:7,6
You want a really, really good
burn on these, so we really


62
0:2:7,6 --> 0:2:10,3
want to see a lot of the water
vapor coming out so we get a


63
0:2:10,3 --> 0:2:11,3
good crush.


64
0:2:11,3 --> 0:2:11,67
All right.


65
0:2:11,67 --> 0:2:14,28
This is looking like it's got
a pretty good burn on it.


66
0:2:14,28 --> 0:2:15,67
We've got water vapor
coming out.


67
0:2:15,67 --> 0:2:17,29
Let's try this first
one right here.


68
0:2:17,29 --> 0:2:18,15
So hold onto the can.


69
0:2:18,15 --> 0:2:18,45
Watch.


70
0:2:18,45 --> 0:2:20,79
Upside down.


71
0:2:20,79 --> 0:2:21,66
Nice.


72
0:2:21,66 --> 0:2:25,4
It's just the pressure of the
air on the outside pushing


73
0:2:25,4 --> 0:2:25,93
against the can.


74
0:2:25,93 --> 0:2:26,61
Watch this one.


75
0:2:26,61 --> 0:2:29,288
Ready, watch.


76
0:2:29,288 --> 0:2:31,6
Bam.


77
0:2:31,6 --> 0:2:31,81
Finally, the last one here.


78
0:2:31,81 --> 0:2:32,82
Here's our tea.


79
0:2:32,82 --> 0:2:35,57
Look at this.


80
0:2:35,57 --> 0:2:37,5
Now when it happens, watch
when we pick it up here.


81
0:2:37,5 --> 0:2:40,69
Look at how much water got
pulled up inside of the can.


82
0:2:40,69 --> 0:2:42,67
No really, I should say how much
water was pushed from the


83
0:2:42,67 --> 0:2:45,27
atmosphere down, and
up inside the can.


84
0:2:45,27 --> 0:2:48,49
See, it's a much better
way to crush a can.


85
0:2:48,49 --> 0:2:51,411
And it's so much easier,
don't you think?


86
0:2:51,411 --> 0:2:53,75
I'm an idiot.


87
0:2:53,75 --> 0:2:57,19
I remember doing this years
ago in a chemistry class.


88
0:2:57,19 --> 0:2:58,65
They had ditto fluid.


89
0:2:58,65 --> 0:3:0,48
So this was a metal can.


90
0:3:0,48 --> 0:3:3,7
So I've kept some of those cans
over the years, it's just


91
0:3:3,7 --> 0:3:5,15
a matter of finding
an empty can.


92
0:3:5,15 --> 0:3:7,43
The trick is not to use a can
that had solvent in it because


93
0:3:7,43 --> 0:3:8,78
you don't want to cook
the solvent.


94
0:3:8,78 --> 0:3:10,3
That could be a whole different
experiment.


95
0:3:10,3 --> 0:3:16,66



96
0:3:16,66 --> 0:3:18,95
I'm not a hoarder.


97
0:3:18,95 --> 0:3:22,48
Look, I just happen to have
this from 20 years ago.


98
0:3:22,48 --> 0:3:24,59
This is perfect.


99
0:3:24,59 --> 0:3:27,57
It's exactly the can that
we're looking for.


100
0:3:27,57 --> 0:3:28,84
So, we'll do the same thing.


101
0:3:28,84 --> 0:3:31,32
We'll put the water inside, then
we'll cap the whole thing


102
0:3:31,32 --> 0:3:35,67
off and see if we can crush this
can using that same kind


103
0:3:35,67 --> 0:3:37,22
of science style.


104
0:3:37,22 --> 0:3:40,16



105
0:3:40,16 --> 0:3:41,44
See the boil that
we have here.


106
0:3:41,44 --> 0:3:42,8
That's we want.


107
0:3:42,8 --> 0:3:47,27
We're pushing all of that air
out, filling the space with


108
0:3:47,27 --> 0:3:48,92
water vapor.


109
0:3:48,92 --> 0:3:50,17
And we should just--


110
0:3:50,17 --> 0:3:51,89
it should be perfect.


111
0:3:51,89 --> 0:3:52,96
Ready?


112
0:3:52,96 --> 0:3:54,4
I think we're good.


113
0:3:54,4 --> 0:3:56,47
Let's turn it off.


114
0:3:56,47 --> 0:4:0,43
Cap this off like this.


115
0:4:0,43 --> 0:4:1,2
Set it here.


116
0:4:1,2 --> 0:4:2,45
And now watch.


117
0:4:2,45 --> 0:4:5,26



118
0:4:5,26 --> 0:4:7,16
You can hear it actually
talking to you.


119
0:4:7,16 --> 0:4:9,755
So unlike the soda can, it takes
a little bit longer.


120
0:4:9,755 --> 0:4:15,87



121
0:4:15,87 --> 0:4:18,97
Imagine all of that air and that
surface area that's there


122
0:4:18,97 --> 0:4:22,18
with that air pressure
pushing on the can.


123
0:4:22,18 --> 0:4:23,73
Let's see what happens if
we cool it down just


124
0:4:23,73 --> 0:4:24,38
a little bit more.


125
0:4:24,38 --> 0:4:25,63
Watch.


126
0:4:25,63 --> 0:4:28,66



127
0:4:28,66 --> 0:4:31,45
Perfect.


128
0:4:31,45 --> 0:4:34,5
This is good, but it's not the
impact that I'm looking for.


129
0:4:34,5 --> 0:4:36,71
And now that we know
how to crush it,


130
0:4:36,71 --> 0:4:37,96
let's just go bigger.


131
0:4:37,96 --> 0:4:40,23



132
0:4:40,23 --> 0:4:43,25
I'm supposed to do TV this
afternoon, so I have a regular


133
0:4:43,25 --> 0:4:46,2
nine news spot this afternoon,
and instead of going down and


134
0:4:46,2 --> 0:4:48,16
doing an experiment, I convinced
my producer to send


135
0:4:48,16 --> 0:4:49,73
a live truck to us.


136
0:4:49,73 --> 0:4:51,53
Since we're practicing it
anyway, I think this looks


137
0:4:51,53 --> 0:4:53,92
totally cool and kind of a
behind-the-scenes of getting


138
0:4:53,92 --> 0:4:55,52
ready to go do the Ellen show.


139
0:4:55,52 --> 0:4:58,19
So it just puts a little bit
more pressure on making sure


140
0:4:58,19 --> 0:4:59,42
this dumb thing works.


141
0:4:59,42 --> 0:5:1,41
And I've got two hours
to make this happen.


142
0:5:1,41 --> 0:5:3,7
With live TV, I mean,
there's no editing.


143
0:5:3,7 --> 0:5:7,38
So I've got to have it crush
in under 60 seconds because


144
0:5:7,38 --> 0:5:9,59
there's just not too much that I
can do to sit there and talk


145
0:5:9,59 --> 0:5:10,0
it through.


146
0:5:10,0 --> 0:5:14,4
So, cross your fingers.


147
0:5:14,4 --> 0:5:15,72
This will be much better.


148
0:5:15,72 --> 0:5:17,35
It's a 55 gallon drum.


149
0:5:17,35 --> 0:5:19,46
We got six of them just to
practice with today because we


150
0:5:19,46 --> 0:5:22,67
just got to make sure that we've
got the timing down.


151
0:5:22,67 --> 0:5:24,17
Take a look at the construction
of the drum, this


152
0:5:24,17 --> 0:5:25,42
is really important.


153
0:5:25,42 --> 0:5:27,943
Notice it's sealed all the way
around, so it's not one that


154
0:5:27,943 --> 0:5:29,13
has a clamp down.


155
0:5:29,13 --> 0:5:33,28
And there's two little places
that could open up.


156
0:5:33,28 --> 0:5:35,115
This one here is going
to remain closed.


157
0:5:35,115 --> 0:5:36,41
We put the water in this one.


158
0:5:36,41 --> 0:5:39,17
So from practice, we know
about 4 liters--


159
0:5:39,17 --> 0:5:40,77
close to a gallon of water--


160
0:5:40,77 --> 0:5:41,56
will go in.


161
0:5:41,56 --> 0:5:45,52
That's going to go up on a
great big, huge turkey--


162
0:5:45,52 --> 0:5:47,9
I don't know, a turkey oven,
you know what I'm talking


163
0:5:47,9 --> 0:5:50,65
about, that you boil the oil for
a turkey at Thanksgiving.


164
0:5:50,65 --> 0:5:52,51
So that's going to boil
this pretty fast.


165
0:5:52,51 --> 0:5:54,54
So we've got a propane
tank off to the side.


166
0:5:54,54 --> 0:5:57,39
Once we have that boiling, that
should be pretty good.


167
0:5:57,39 --> 0:5:59,61
And we can do that kind of ahead
of time and then kind of


168
0:5:59,61 --> 0:6:2,38
wheel that out when we
have to on stage.


169
0:6:2,38 --> 0:6:5,64
The real problem is, I know
this is going to work--


170
0:6:5,64 --> 0:6:8,5
I mean look at this, it's
going to crush--


171
0:6:8,5 --> 0:6:9,18
but I need to do this.


172
0:6:9,18 --> 0:6:13,5
I need to have maximum
implosion, and also I have to


173
0:6:13,5 --> 0:6:15,56
do it within a certain period
of time because they can't


174
0:6:15,56 --> 0:6:16,97
wait like for four
or five minutes.


175
0:6:16,97 --> 0:6:19,6
So that's where these
kind of come in.


176
0:6:19,6 --> 0:6:21,41
I think what we'll do is we'll
take ice water and fill the


177
0:6:21,41 --> 0:6:22,69
four buckets with ice water.


178
0:6:22,69 --> 0:6:26,14
So slowly, we can kind of pour
those over them like this.


179
0:6:26,14 --> 0:6:27,9
Hopefully we can
cool it faster.


180
0:6:27,9 --> 0:6:32,2
We've got to catch everything,
so follow me over here.


181
0:6:32,2 --> 0:6:35,68
A handy dandy kids swimming
pool should be perfect.


182
0:6:35,68 --> 0:6:37,37
So the set up will look
something like this.


183
0:6:37,37 --> 0:6:39,3
We'll throw the swimming
pool here.


184
0:6:39,3 --> 0:6:39,96
Got it.


185
0:6:39,96 --> 0:6:43,57
We'll fill that with three,
four inches of water.


186
0:6:43,57 --> 0:6:45,92
We'll put ice in there so
it's nice and cold.


187
0:6:45,92 --> 0:6:48,81
Then we'll heat this up, boil
it away, we'll find a couple


188
0:6:48,81 --> 0:6:51,51
rods here like this.


189
0:6:51,51 --> 0:6:54,21
Jeff and I will grab it on
either end, we'll pick this


190
0:6:54,21 --> 0:6:56,87
up, set it in there, and then
the stopwatch starts.


191
0:6:56,87 --> 0:6:58,78
I need a crush within
60 seconds.


192
0:6:58,78 --> 0:7:0,85
We really just can't edit
around 60 seconds.


193
0:7:0,85 --> 0:7:4,18
So if I can do it within 60
seconds, it'll be perfect.


194
0:7:4,18 --> 0:7:5,43
We'll see if it happens.


195
0:7:5,43 --> 0:7:9,1



196
0:7:9,1 --> 0:7:11,81
This will give us more than
enough to boil away, and


197
0:7:11,81 --> 0:7:14,76
again, the entire trick here
is to be able to get it to


198
0:7:14,76 --> 0:7:17,38
boil, and to get all that water
vapor kind of coming


199
0:7:17,38 --> 0:7:18,87
out, push all the air out.


200
0:7:18,87 --> 0:7:21,38
We've got to get a really
good, rapid boil on it.


201
0:7:21,38 --> 0:7:23,6
We can do all that backstage or
kind of behind the scenes,


202
0:7:23,6 --> 0:7:24,88
so I'm not worried about that.


203
0:7:24,88 --> 0:7:27,31
It's from the moment that we cap
off the lid and go, that's


204
0:7:27,31 --> 0:7:29,22
when the clock starts ticking.


205
0:7:29,22 --> 0:7:30,43
See, and the situation
is this.


206
0:7:30,43 --> 0:7:33,3
If you need some water, why
wouldn't you just go and get a


207
0:7:33,3 --> 0:7:34,17
forklift first.


208
0:7:34,17 --> 0:7:35,77
So if you want to try
this at home, get a


209
0:7:35,77 --> 0:7:37,38
forklift, number one.


210
0:7:37,38 --> 0:7:39,95
Number two, get a great big
huge pool like this.


211
0:7:39,95 --> 0:7:41,84
Don't use this empty one that's
here and just like a


212
0:7:41,84 --> 0:7:43,9
hose that you could
put into it.


213
0:7:43,9 --> 0:7:43,59
No.


214
0:7:43,59 --> 0:7:44,84
Move it in with a forklift.


215
0:7:44,84 --> 0:7:48,15



216
0:7:48,15 --> 0:7:51,96
And then, hire a union guy like
this to go ahead and just


217
0:7:51,96 --> 0:7:53,63
kind of put it in place.


218
0:7:53,63 --> 0:7:54,42
This is perfect.


219
0:7:54,42 --> 0:7:56,67
Why couldn't you recreate
this at home.


220
0:7:56,67 --> 0:7:58,277
And I would expect that you
would be doing that.


221
0:7:58,277 --> 0:8:6,23



222
0:8:6,23 --> 0:8:7,71
Nice.


223
0:8:7,71 --> 0:8:9,67
All right, see the water
vapor coming up here.


224
0:8:9,67 --> 0:8:10,3
You know, the steam.


225
0:8:10,3 --> 0:8:13,11
You can't be fooled by that
small amount that's coming up.


226
0:8:13,11 --> 0:8:16,54
We need, for this 55 gallon
drum, a great rumble inside.


227
0:8:16,54 --> 0:8:18,18
So we need a lot coming out.


228
0:8:18,18 --> 0:8:19,69
So, we'll see this increase.


229
0:8:19,69 --> 0:8:23,405
Again, it's pushing all the air
out, and it'll be perfect


230
0:8:23,405 --> 0:8:24,64
when we cap it off.


231
0:8:24,64 --> 0:8:25,89
We got to get it burning more.


232
0:8:25,89 --> 0:8:31,62



233
0:8:31,62 --> 0:8:32,52
See the rumble that
we have here?


234
0:8:32,52 --> 0:8:34,71
That's kind of the volume
that we're looking for,


235
0:8:34,71 --> 0:8:36,35
consistently coming out.


236
0:8:36,35 --> 0:8:38,2
I think we're right there.


237
0:8:38,2 --> 0:8:40,7
So we're going to turn the
burner off, then we're going


238
0:8:40,7 --> 0:8:42,75
to put the cap on, and get
it over onto the side.


239
0:8:42,75 --> 0:8:45,61
He's got the tight cap because
we don't want any of that air


240
0:8:45,61 --> 0:8:47,31
coming back in again.


241
0:8:47,31 --> 0:8:49,4
Just going to grab the edges
here, we're going to pick it


242
0:8:49,4 --> 0:8:54,5
up, ready, put it in.


243
0:8:54,5 --> 0:8:55,33
Good.


244
0:8:55,33 --> 0:8:56,64
Now it's starting
to cool down.


245
0:8:56,64 --> 0:8:57,89
Somebody needs to
start the timer.


246
0:8:57,89 --> 0:9:2,1



247
0:9:2,1 --> 0:9:3,26
Let's tip it over.


248
0:9:3,26 --> 0:9:16,14



249
0:9:16,14 --> 0:9:18,34
See, this should do it with
no problem at all.


250
0:9:18,34 --> 0:9:22,48



251
0:9:22,48 --> 0:9:23,77
I think we try another drum.


252
0:9:23,77 --> 0:9:27,82
We'll pull this out, we'll
try another drum.


253
0:9:27,82 --> 0:9:28,332
OK.


254
0:9:28,332 --> 0:9:31,7



255
0:9:31,7 --> 0:9:32,32
I don't know.

0:9:45,46 --> 0:9:45,86
All right.


260
0:9:45,86 --> 0:9:48,55
Well, that worked.


261
0:9:48,55 --> 0:9:53,27
It just took a little baseball
bat hit, we crushed the can.


262
0:9:53,27 --> 0:9:57,2
Unfortunately, we
can't do that.


263
0:9:57,2 --> 0:10:0,9
That's not the whole idea here,
but maybe it's just--


264
0:10:0,9 --> 0:10:2,55
oh my gosh, look at this.


265
0:10:2,55 --> 0:10:4,314
God, that's amazing,
look at that.


266
0:10:4,314 --> 0:10:10,48



267
0:10:10,48 --> 0:10:27,57
Now it's my job to start the
55 gallon drum graveyard.


268
0:10:27,57 --> 0:10:29,18
One down, six to go.


269
0:10:29,18 --> 0:10:32,3



270
0:10:32,3 --> 0:10:33,31
All right, so here's
where we are now.


271
0:10:33,31 --> 0:10:36,31
We're at 200 degrees with this
thermometer, that's just


272
0:10:36,31 --> 0:10:37,29
surface temperature.


273
0:10:37,29 --> 0:10:39,5
We started with two gallons of
water, we're getting a really


274
0:10:39,5 --> 0:10:40,93
good roll here.


275
0:10:40,93 --> 0:10:44,55
Let's use this as a benchmark
and see if it works.


276
0:10:44,55 --> 0:10:45,8
Start the clock.


277
0:10:45,8 --> 0:10:50,76



278
0:10:50,76 --> 0:10:52,28
Yes, let's do it.


279
0:10:52,28 --> 0:10:54,84
OK, so the trick here
is to cool it down


280
0:10:54,84 --> 0:10:58,34
as much as we can.


281
0:10:58,34 --> 0:10:59,59
Hear it talking?


282
0:10:59,59 --> 0:11:5,36



283
0:11:5,36 --> 0:11:8,7
That's not the implosion that
I wanted, so it's a happy


284
0:11:8,7 --> 0:11:8,63
in-between.


285
0:11:8,63 --> 0:11:11,6
So it's either we cooled
it too fast.


286
0:11:11,6 --> 0:11:12,93
And we want that implosion.


287
0:11:12,93 --> 0:11:16,94
So the next one I think we do,
is pour a little bit of water


288
0:11:16,94 --> 0:11:18,91
on it, but just let it
sit and see what


289
0:11:18,91 --> 0:11:20,65
happens with the implosion.


290
0:11:20,65 --> 0:11:22,13
Put it in.


291
0:11:22,13 --> 0:11:23,38
Start the clock.


292

293
0:11:37,8 --> 0:11:37,86

295
0:11:39,7 --> 0:11:41,61
40 seconds.


296
0:11:41,61 --> 0:11:44,65
Even when you were that
close, it was OK.


297
0:11:44,65 --> 0:11:47,15
All right, we're going for
maximum implosion this time,


298
0:11:47,15 --> 0:11:49,55
and so we've cooked this off.


299
0:11:49,55 --> 0:11:50,76
It's sitting here at about
the 10 minute mark


300
0:11:50,76 --> 0:11:51,87
where we were before.


301
0:11:51,87 --> 0:11:53,2
Same amount of water.


302
0:11:53,2 --> 0:11:56,12
This time we're going to put it
in the ice bath, we're not


303
0:11:56,12 --> 0:11:58,34
going to pour anything on top of
it and see if it will crush


304
0:11:58,34 --> 0:11:59,545
within the first 60 seconds.


305
0:11:59,545 --> 0:12:3,4
If not, then we're going to
pour slightly and see--


306
0:12:3,4 --> 0:12:4,97
right now, I know that it will
crush, I just want a good


307
0:12:4,97 --> 0:12:7,83
implosion to scare
the audience.


308
0:12:7,83 --> 0:12:9,89
I mean to get them excited
about the whole process.


309
0:12:9,89 --> 0:12:11,37
Who am I kidding, I want to
scare the crap out of them.

starting to crinkle just a

little bit.


314
0:12:23,31 --> 0:12:24,34

[EXPLODING SOUND]

0:12:47,923 --> 0:12:50,44
That's how to crush a can.


329
0:12:50,44 --> 0:12:53,45
All right, so with this
particular can, here's what we


330
0:12:53,45 --> 0:12:54,48
could have figured out.


331
0:12:54,48 --> 0:12:55,95
We had too much water
to start with.


332
0:12:55,95 --> 0:12:58,78
We weren't getting the boil
that we really needed, so


333
0:12:58,78 --> 0:13:0,45
fixed that problem.


334
0:13:0,45 --> 0:13:3,2
No problem with capping it off,
that wasn't a problem.


335
0:13:3,2 --> 0:13:5,18
We thought maybe we had to have
the water colder, that


336
0:13:5,18 --> 0:13:6,2
wasn't a problem.


337
0:13:6,2 --> 0:13:7,9
We just have to trust that
it's going to happen.


338
0:13:7,9 --> 0:13:10,4
So, pouring just a little bit
of water on the top starts


339
0:13:10,4 --> 0:13:11,95
that whole process of cooling.


340
0:13:11,95 --> 0:13:15,35
Those molecules are 1,700 times
further away from each
