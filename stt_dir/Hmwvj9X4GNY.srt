1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:0,4



2
0:0:0,4 --> 0:0:3,67
Let's talk a little bit about
the structure of the cell.


3
0:0:3,67 --> 0:0:6,48
I've done a lot of videos where
we deal with things that


4
0:0:6,48 --> 0:0:8,56
go on inside of them, but I
haven't done one where we just


5
0:0:8,56 --> 0:0:10,87
talk about the entire
structure of them.


6
0:0:10,87 --> 0:0:14,5
So a good place to start is--
let me just draw the membrane.


7
0:0:14,5 --> 0:0:17,85
And the cellular membrane is a
good place to start because


8
0:0:17,85 --> 0:0:20,78
this is what separates the cell
from the outside world,


9
0:0:20,78 --> 0:0:24,2
and to a large degree, it kind
of defines the cell.


10
0:0:24,2 --> 0:0:27,2
It defines it as this very,
very small compartment.


11
0:0:27,2 --> 0:0:29,22
That's where the word,
"cell" came from.


12
0:0:29,22 --> 0:0:30,87
So let me label that.


13
0:0:30,87 --> 0:0:35,39
Cellular membrane.


14
0:0:35,39 --> 0:0:39,57
And all cells have a
cellular membrane.


15
0:0:39,57 --> 0:0:45,49
Now if we think about maybe the
most important thing that


16
0:0:45,49 --> 0:0:48,59
defines a cell, you've probably
seen in the DNA


17
0:0:48,59 --> 0:0:50,68
videos and we're going to talk
about translation and


18
0:0:50,68 --> 0:0:53,3
transcription and all of that,
that what defines what a


19
0:0:53,3 --> 0:0:55,44
living organism is,
is its DNA.


20
0:0:55,44 --> 0:0:57,57
So all cells have DNA
inside of it.


21
0:0:57,57 --> 0:1:0,27
And I won't go into the details
of how DNA defines


22
0:1:0,27 --> 0:1:1,15
what an organism is.


23
0:1:1,15 --> 0:1:3,58
I've done that in some detail
on the DNA videos.


24
0:1:3,58 --> 0:1:5,19
But all cells have DNA.


25
0:1:5,19 --> 0:1:9,15
This is more of an anatomy of a
cell video than necessarily


26
0:1:9,15 --> 0:1:11,2
the function, but we'll go into
the function because we


27
0:1:11,2 --> 0:1:12,78
need to know what these
different parts do.


28
0:1:12,78 --> 0:1:16,61
So this is, right here,
this is the DNA.


29
0:1:16,61 --> 0:1:18,39
And it's in its chromatin
form here.


30
0:1:18,39 --> 0:1:21,19
There's also little
proteins here.


31
0:1:21,19 --> 0:1:23,17
Not in all organisms, but
we're going to stick to


32
0:1:23,17 --> 0:1:25,0
eukaryotes, and I'll talk
a little bit about the


33
0:1:25,0 --> 0:1:28,635
difference between eukaryotes
and prokaryotes in a second.


34
0:1:28,635 --> 0:1:29,94
But we have DNA.


35
0:1:29,94 --> 0:1:33,39
As I've drawn this cell right
now, this is pretty much any


36
0:1:33,39 --> 0:1:37,81
cell, and any animal or plant
or whatever kingdom


37
0:1:37,81 --> 0:1:38,84
could look like this.


38
0:1:38,84 --> 0:1:40,3
I haven't drawn a lot
of the details.


39
0:1:40,3 --> 0:1:43,27
I've just drawn the DNA and
the cellular membrane.


40
0:1:43,27 --> 0:1:47,46
Now here's kind of the first
major division in the living


41
0:1:47,46 --> 0:1:52,43
world, or at least from our
point of view, or it seemed


42
0:1:52,43 --> 0:1:54,56
obvious, is that some
cells have a


43
0:1:54,56 --> 0:1:58,33
membrane around the DNA.


44
0:1:58,33 --> 0:2:1,97
So they'll have a membrane
around the DNA that separates


45
0:2:1,97 --> 0:2:5,1
the DNA and the chromatin and
everything that makes up the


46
0:2:5,1 --> 0:2:8,9
stuff within the DNA, separates
that from the rest


47
0:2:8,9 --> 0:2:11,13
of the cell, and this
is called a nucleus.


48
0:2:11,13 --> 0:2:14,92
This is called a nucleus.


49
0:2:14,92 --> 0:2:17,67
And I said that's a major
division because when some


50
0:2:17,67 --> 0:2:19,77
people looked at some cells
and they saw a nucleus and


51
0:2:19,77 --> 0:2:21,78
other cells and they didn't see
a nucleus, they said, hey,


52
0:2:21,78 --> 0:2:25,21
this is a good way to classify
organisms. So they called the


53
0:2:25,21 --> 0:2:27,48
things that had nucleuses,
eukaryotes.


54
0:2:27,48 --> 0:2:30,47



55
0:2:30,47 --> 0:2:32,15
These have a nucleus.


56
0:2:32,15 --> 0:2:36,95
So as I've drawn this cell right
here, it is a eukaryote.


57
0:2:36,95 --> 0:2:40,35
Now, if you do not have a
nucleus, you are dealing with


58
0:2:40,35 --> 0:2:41,6
a prokaryote.


59
0:2:41,6 --> 0:2:44,18



60
0:2:44,18 --> 0:2:48,44
No nucleus.


61
0:2:48,44 --> 0:2:52,32
And examples of prokaryotes,
the two big groups of them,


62
0:2:52,32 --> 0:2:57,11
are bacteria and Archaea.


63
0:2:57,11 --> 0:2:58,2
Now, Archaea are really
interesting.


64
0:2:58,2 --> 0:3:0,9
We know very little
about them.


65
0:3:0,9 --> 0:3:4,19
They were originally thought to
be types of bacteria, but


66
0:3:4,19 --> 0:3:6,77
now people are realizing that
they're this whole completely


67
0:3:6,77 --> 0:3:10,87
other group, and we've actually
observed a very small


68
0:3:10,87 --> 0:3:13,5
subset of them, so it's a
very fascinating group.


69
0:3:13,5 --> 0:3:16,4
And it actually turns out that,
evolutionarily speaking,


70
0:3:16,4 --> 0:3:18,3
you shouldn't make this division
first. It actually


71
0:3:18,3 --> 0:3:21,8
makes more sense to divide
things into eukaryotes, I'll


72
0:3:21,8 --> 0:3:27,1
just write that Euk, bacteria
and Archaea.


73
0:3:27,1 --> 0:3:29,23
You don't want to do this
division first. There are


74
0:3:29,23 --> 0:3:31,37
actually three separate
groups that you want


75
0:3:31,37 --> 0:3:33,79
to start off with.


76
0:3:33,79 --> 0:3:35,84
We'll talk more about this
in future videos.


77
0:3:35,84 --> 0:3:37,28
But if you want to say
who has a nucleus?


78
0:3:37,28 --> 0:3:40,11
Well, eukaryotes have a
nucleus by definition.


79
0:3:40,11 --> 0:3:41,67
Who does not have a nucleus?


80
0:3:41,67 --> 0:3:46,11
Well, the bacteria and the
Archaea do not have nuclei,


81
0:3:46,11 --> 0:3:46,74
just like that.


82
0:3:46,74 --> 0:3:49,78
But I'm going to focus on
eukaryotes because they tend


83
0:3:49,78 --> 0:3:51,5
to be a little bit
more complex.


84
0:3:51,5 --> 0:3:53,7
They tend to be larger.


85
0:3:53,7 --> 0:3:55,72
And most of what we talk about,
at least in the videos


86
0:3:55,72 --> 0:3:57,81
so far, are dealing
with eukaryotes.


87
0:3:57,81 --> 0:4:2,84
Eukaryotes include plants,
animals-- we're animals, at


88
0:4:2,84 --> 0:4:8,68
least I am-- animals and fungi,
and there are other


89
0:4:8,68 --> 0:4:11,2
groups within eukaryotes, but
these are the ones that we


90
0:4:11,2 --> 0:4:14,29
normally deal with in
our everyday world.


91
0:4:14,29 --> 0:4:16,829
But let's go back to looking
at the anatomy of the cell.


92
0:4:16,829 --> 0:4:18,0
So we have our DNA.


93
0:4:18,0 --> 0:4:21,839
We know that it gets transcribed
into mRNA, That


94
0:4:21,839 --> 0:4:29,54
mRNA leaves the nucleus, and
it gets translated into


95
0:4:29,54 --> 0:4:32,39
proteins at the ribosomes.


96
0:4:32,39 --> 0:4:36,53
So the ribosomes are these
little complexes that could be


97
0:4:36,53 --> 0:4:38,78
floating all over the cell, and
we'll see in a second that


98
0:4:38,78 --> 0:4:41,43
they can also be attached
to these other membrane


99
0:4:41,43 --> 0:4:42,28
structures.


100
0:4:42,28 --> 0:4:43,53
So this is a ribosome.


101
0:4:43,53 --> 0:4:47,56



102
0:4:47,56 --> 0:4:51,59
And if all this talk of DNA
transcription into mRNA and


103
0:4:51,59 --> 0:4:55,0
mRNA leaving the nucleus and
traveling to the ribosome to


104
0:4:55,0 --> 0:4:58,71
be translated into proteins
makes no sense to you, there


105
0:4:58,71 --> 0:5:0,72
are several videos where I
go into that in detail.


106
0:5:0,72 --> 0:5:2,66
But what I want to do is just
focus on all of the different


107
0:5:2,66 --> 0:5:4,82
parts to kind of give a
big picture of things.


108
0:5:4,82 --> 0:5:11,59
So ribosomes are where mRNA that
gets transcribed inside


109
0:5:11,59 --> 0:5:18,75
the nucleus from DNA, where it
gets translated into proteins.


110
0:5:18,75 --> 0:5:21,58
So you can kind of view them as
the place where information


111
0:5:21,58 --> 0:5:24,72
actually turns into proteins,
which then can be used


112
0:5:24,72 --> 0:5:27,5
anywhere else in the cell.


113
0:5:27,5 --> 0:5:30,16
And these ribosomes, they're
made up of proteins, and


114
0:5:30,16 --> 0:5:33,3
actually they're made up RNA.


115
0:5:33,3 --> 0:5:36,0
And so one question is, well,
where are the pieces of the


116
0:5:36,0 --> 0:5:37,8
ribosomes made?


117
0:5:37,8 --> 0:5:39,19
Well, some are made by proteins,
which might be made


118
0:5:39,19 --> 0:5:40,6
in other ribosomes.


119
0:5:40,6 --> 0:5:43,36
But some of it, the mRNA,
ribosomes, you can kind of


120
0:5:43,36 --> 0:5:46,77
view them as this big
mess, if you were to


121
0:5:46,77 --> 0:5:47,98
look at it in detail.


122
0:5:47,98 --> 0:5:49,9
There's some protein there.


123
0:5:49,9 --> 0:5:51,72
And I'm not drawing it that
realistically, but then you


124
0:5:51,72 --> 0:5:55,13
have some mRNA tied in with
the protein, and the mRNA


125
0:5:55,13 --> 0:5:58,49
isn't used for actual
information purposes like it


126
0:5:58,49 --> 0:6:1,6
normally is when it goes from
DNA to the ribosome.


127
0:6:1,6 --> 0:6:5,77
Within the ribosome itself,
ribosomal RNA is actually used


128
0:6:5,77 --> 0:6:6,89
as part of the structure.


129
0:6:6,89 --> 0:6:10,48
It actually helps the ribosome
function as a ribosome.


130
0:6:10,48 --> 0:6:12,42
So it's actually part
of the ribosome.


131
0:6:12,42 --> 0:6:20,6
And all of that gets built in
a part of the nucleus called


132
0:6:20,6 --> 0:6:22,96
the nucleolus or the nucleole.


133
0:6:22,96 --> 0:6:26,7
Let me write that down.


134
0:6:26,7 --> 0:6:28,97
So this right here, this is
interesting right here.


135
0:6:28,97 --> 0:6:34,68
This is the nucleolus
or the nucleole.


136
0:6:34,68 --> 0:6:36,86
And it isn't a separate
organelle, and it's not


137
0:6:36,86 --> 0:6:39,55
separated by a membrane, but it
shows up in a microscope.


138
0:6:39,55 --> 0:6:41,13
So when people first saw it,
they said, hey, there's like a


139
0:6:41,13 --> 0:6:41,98
bundle there.


140
0:6:41,98 --> 0:6:45,21
That must be like the core of
the nucleus or something.


141
0:6:45,21 --> 0:6:47,92
But it turns out what it is,
it's the densely packed--


142
0:6:47,92 --> 0:6:50,19
you've got DNA and RNA, and
that's actually where the


143
0:6:50,19 --> 0:6:54,24
ribosomal RNA, the stuff that
makes up the ribosomes, is


144
0:6:54,24 --> 0:6:55,2
actually produced.


145
0:6:55,2 --> 0:6:57,82
But it's so dense that it shows
up on a microscope, and


146
0:6:57,82 --> 0:7:0,8
that's why people decided to
name it something different.


147
0:7:0,8 --> 0:7:1,51
But it is not membrane bound.


148
0:7:1,51 --> 0:7:3,96
It's not an organelle
within an organelle.


149
0:7:3,96 --> 0:7:8,9
It's just densely packed
proteins and ribosomal RNA,


150
0:7:8,9 --> 0:7:11,55
and it's where ribosomal
RNA gets produced.


151
0:7:11,55 --> 0:7:13,62
So anyway, we're at
the ribosome.


152
0:7:13,62 --> 0:7:15,4
That's where proteins
get produced.


153
0:7:15,4 --> 0:7:18,3
But if the ribosomes are just
floating around, if they're


154
0:7:18,3 --> 0:7:21,34
free ribosomes, then those
proteins will just-- once


155
0:7:21,34 --> 0:7:23,43
they're produced at the
ribosome, they'll just float


156
0:7:23,43 --> 0:7:25,59
around here in the fluid
inside the cell


157
0:7:25,59 --> 0:7:26,84
that we call cytosol.


158
0:7:26,84 --> 0:7:29,19



159
0:7:29,19 --> 0:7:32,83
But what if we wanted to produce
proteins that are


160
0:7:32,83 --> 0:7:36,95
supposed to end up, maybe in the
membrane of the cell, or


161
0:7:36,95 --> 0:7:39,85
maybe outside of the
cell itself?


162
0:7:39,85 --> 0:7:41,97
Cells produce things that are
used by other cells, that are


163
0:7:41,97 --> 0:7:43,45
used by the rest of the body.


164
0:7:43,45 --> 0:7:47,44
And here we have to go to
proteins that are attached to


165
0:7:47,44 --> 0:7:48,22
this membrane.


166
0:7:48,22 --> 0:7:50,58
You can kind of view it
as a bunch of tunnels.


167
0:7:50,58 --> 0:7:52,88
Let me see how well
I can draw that.


168
0:7:52,88 --> 0:7:55,13
I'm going to draw
it very roughly.


169
0:7:55,13 --> 0:7:58,67
You have this thing called the
endoplasmic reticulum.


170
0:7:58,67 --> 0:7:59,92
Endoplasmic reticulum.


171
0:7:59,92 --> 0:8:1,99



172
0:8:1,99 --> 0:8:6,21
You can just view it as a bunch
of tunnels like that.


173
0:8:6,21 --> 0:8:7,46
Endoplasmic reticulum.


174
0:8:7,46 --> 0:8:9,47



175
0:8:9,47 --> 0:8:13,14
And they eventually lead to
something called Golgi bodies,


176
0:8:13,14 --> 0:8:15,73
named after Mr. Golgi himself.


177
0:8:15,73 --> 0:8:18,11
So I'll do the endoplasmic
reticulum in yellow and I'll


178
0:8:18,11 --> 0:8:23,52
do the Golgi bodies in green
maybe, just like that.


179
0:8:23,52 --> 0:8:25,34
I'll tell you in a second
what they are.


180
0:8:25,34 --> 0:8:26,17
So what's going on?


181
0:8:26,17 --> 0:8:30,2
This is kind of a big kind of
stack, or you can kind of view


182
0:8:30,2 --> 0:8:32,25
it as a bunch of folded
membranes together.


183
0:8:32,25 --> 0:8:36,39
And some ribosomes are actually
attached to this


184
0:8:36,39 --> 0:8:38,84
part, which I call the
endoplasmic reticulum.


185
0:8:38,84 --> 0:8:42,88
So we have ribosomes attached.


186
0:8:42,88 --> 0:8:45,4
Some of them are free, some
of them are attached.


187
0:8:45,4 --> 0:8:47,6
And let me write
my labels down.


188
0:8:47,6 --> 0:8:51,54
So this right here, and we use
the space over here, this big


189
0:8:51,54 --> 0:8:55,43
flap of convoluted
membrane, that's


190
0:8:55,43 --> 0:8:56,68
the endoplasmic reticulum.


191
0:8:56,68 --> 0:9:2,206



192
0:9:2,206 --> 0:9:4,2
It's fun to say.


193
0:9:4,2 --> 0:9:5,66
Endoplasmic reticulum.


194
0:9:5,66 --> 0:9:8,51
Maybe a good name for a band.


195
0:9:8,51 --> 0:9:11,78
Endoplasmic reticulum, and the
parts that have ribosomes


196
0:9:11,78 --> 0:9:14,86
attached to it are called the
rough endoplasmic reticulum.


197
0:9:14,86 --> 0:9:17,14
Maybe even a better
name for a band.


198
0:9:17,14 --> 0:9:21,75
So right here, where I have
attached ribosomes, so these


199
0:9:21,75 --> 0:9:24,77
ribosomes are attached right
here, this is the rough


200
0:9:24,77 --> 0:9:28,64
endoplasmic reticulum, or
maybe the rough ER.


201
0:9:28,64 --> 0:9:35,41
The rough ER, ER standing for
endoplasmic reticulum.


202
0:9:35,41 --> 0:9:38,21
And then where we don't have any
ribosomes attached, that's


203
0:9:38,21 --> 0:9:41,53
the smooth endoplasmic
reticulum.


204
0:9:41,53 --> 0:9:48,7
So right here, that is this
smooth endoplasmic reticulum.


205
0:9:48,7 --> 0:9:50,34
And I'm going to tell you in a
second what this is, but we


206
0:9:50,34 --> 0:9:51,87
can keep following
the membranes.


207
0:9:51,87 --> 0:9:53,49
Eventually we get the
Golgi bodies.


208
0:9:53,49 --> 0:9:57,65



209
0:9:57,65 --> 0:9:59,5
And what happens is,
I gave you a hint.


210
0:9:59,5 --> 0:10:2,43
In our free ribosomes, mRNA gets
there, gets translated


211
0:10:2,43 --> 0:10:4,61
into proteins, and the proteins
then just float


212
0:10:4,61 --> 0:10:6,36
around in the cytosol.


213
0:10:6,36 --> 0:10:8,93
But what if we want proteins
that should end up in


214
0:10:8,93 --> 0:10:11,19
membranes or that end up
outside of the cell?


215
0:10:11,19 --> 0:10:14,0
And that's where the endoplasmic
reticulum and the


216
0:10:14,0 --> 0:10:15,89
Golgi bodies come into play.


217
0:10:15,89 --> 0:10:20,68
Because now what we can do is,
we have mRNA coming outside of


218
0:10:20,68 --> 0:10:24,56
the nucleus, and it can attach
to the ribosomes or it can be


219
0:10:24,56 --> 0:10:27,69
translated by the ribosomes
in the rough ER.


220
0:10:27,69 --> 0:10:30,19
And what happens here is your
mRNA comes here and it's


221
0:10:30,19 --> 0:10:32,24
getting-- and I drew that
arrow very small-- it's


222
0:10:32,24 --> 0:10:34,725
getting translated on the
outside of the endoplasmic


223
0:10:34,725 --> 0:10:38,94
reticulum, but as the protein
gets produced, it's getting


224
0:10:38,94 --> 0:10:42,66
pushed into the inside of the
endoplasmic reticulum.


225
0:10:42,66 --> 0:10:44,95
And when I say the inside of the
endoplasmic reticulum, I'm


226
0:10:44,95 --> 0:10:46,59
talking about this area.


227
0:10:46,59 --> 0:10:47,47
I'm coloring it in.


228
0:10:47,47 --> 0:10:51,3
This is the inside of the
endoplasmic reticulum.


229
0:10:51,3 --> 0:10:53,7
And so the proteins will
get pushed into


230
0:10:53,7 --> 0:10:54,44
the endoplasmic reticulum.


231
0:10:54,44 --> 0:10:57,4
The ones that are to be used
outside of the cytosol,


232
0:10:57,4 --> 0:10:59,4
outside of the cell or maybe
in the cell's membrane.


233
0:10:59,4 --> 0:11:1,35
So proteins will end up here.


234
0:11:1,35 --> 0:11:4,12
That's why those ribosomes are
on the membrane, because they


235
0:11:4,12 --> 0:11:6,315
can translate things that are
outside of the endoplasmic


236
0:11:6,315 --> 0:11:11,8
reticulum, but as the proteins
get produced, the amino acid


237
0:11:11,8 --> 0:11:13,43
chain ends up inside of it.


238
0:11:13,43 --> 0:11:16,63
Let me make a blow-up
of that because I


239
0:11:16,63 --> 0:11:18,93
think that'll be useful.


240
0:11:18,93 --> 0:11:23,43
So let me draw-- let's say this
is the membrane of the


241
0:11:23,43 --> 0:11:26,45
endoplasmic reticulum
and then you have


242
0:11:26,45 --> 0:11:29,8
ribosomes attached to it.


243
0:11:29,8 --> 0:11:32,9
Let's say that's a ribosome on
the endoplasmic reticulum.


244
0:11:32,9 --> 0:11:35,86
And is this is going to be the
rough endoplasmic reticulum.


245
0:11:35,86 --> 0:11:39,79
And what you can have is mRNA
coming into one side of it.


246
0:11:39,79 --> 0:11:43,82



247
0:11:43,82 --> 0:11:46,86
mRNA can kind of come
in through here.


248
0:11:46,86 --> 0:11:48,5
Maybe it's going in
that direction.


249
0:11:48,5 --> 0:11:51,43
It's getting translated
into the proteins.


250
0:11:51,43 --> 0:11:54,81
But then the protein, as the
amino acid chain is built up,


251
0:11:54,81 --> 0:11:57,71
will pop out on this end
of the membrane.


252
0:11:57,71 --> 0:12:0,3
Remember, this is our membrane
of our endoplasmic reticulum.


253
0:12:0,3 --> 0:12:3,7
So even though the mRNA is on
the outside, because the


254
0:12:3,7 --> 0:12:5,71
ribosome is attached to
it, the protein can


255
0:12:5,71 --> 0:12:6,79
show up on the inside.


256
0:12:6,79 --> 0:12:9,51
So once the protein is built,
maybe then it folds all up,


257
0:12:9,51 --> 0:12:13,9
you know, a protein is just a
folded chain of amino acids,


258
0:12:13,9 --> 0:12:16,375
it can travel through the
endoplasmic reticulum.


259
0:12:16,375 --> 0:12:17,92
And it travels through it.


260
0:12:17,92 --> 0:12:21,14
It travels through the smooth
endoplasmic reticulum all the


261
0:12:21,14 --> 0:12:22,59
way until it gets to
the Golgi bodies.


262
0:12:22,59 --> 0:12:23,87
And all sorts of other
things happen.


263
0:12:23,87 --> 0:12:26,223
I'm oversimplifying things, but
I just want to give you a


264
0:12:26,223 --> 0:12:28,58
sense of what everything
in the cell does.


265
0:12:28,58 --> 0:12:31,39
And once the protein travels to
the Golgi bodies and they


266
0:12:31,39 --> 0:12:35,23
get ready for traveling outside
of the cell, or maybe


267
0:12:35,23 --> 0:12:38,71
traveling to the cell's
membrane, they'll actually bud


268
0:12:38,71 --> 0:12:39,77
out of the Golgi bodies.


269
0:12:39,77 --> 0:12:42,53
So let's say this same protein,
when it gets to the


270
0:12:42,53 --> 0:12:45,225
Golgi bodies-- remember it's
inside of the Golgi body, so


271
0:12:45,225 --> 0:12:48,8
let me draw the membrane of the
Golgi body right there.


272
0:12:48,8 --> 0:12:50,52
The protein might
end up there.


273
0:12:50,52 --> 0:12:52,83
It's just a big chain
of amino acids.


274
0:12:52,83 --> 0:12:54,88
And then it will bud out.


275
0:12:54,88 --> 0:12:56,78
So let's say it looks like that,
and then maybe the next


276
0:12:56,78 --> 0:12:59,63
step it will look
something like.


277
0:12:59,63 --> 0:13:0,88
It will look like that.


278
0:13:0,88 --> 0:13:7,18



279
0:13:7,18 --> 0:13:9,31
And the very next step, you
could imagine, will look


280
0:13:9,31 --> 0:13:11,87
something like this, where
it's actually completely


281
0:13:11,87 --> 0:13:12,42
budded out.


282
0:13:12,42 --> 0:13:15,85
It's popped out a little
of the membrane of the


283
0:13:15,85 --> 0:13:18,7
Golgi body with it.


284
0:13:18,7 --> 0:13:20,1
So now the protein
is surrounded by


285
0:13:20,1 --> 0:13:22,76
its own little membrane.


286
0:13:22,76 --> 0:13:24,59
So let's think about
what happened.


287
0:13:24,59 --> 0:13:27,26
We had DNA transcribed
into mRNA.


288
0:13:27,26 --> 0:13:30,98
mRNA goes to a ribosome
that's attached to


289
0:13:30,98 --> 0:13:32,74
the endoplasmic reticulum.


290
0:13:32,74 --> 0:13:35,74
It is translated into a protein
that travels through


291
0:13:35,74 --> 0:13:37,32
the endoplasmic reticulum.


292
0:13:37,32 --> 0:13:39,15
First, the rough, where
all the ribosomes


293
0:13:39,15 --> 0:13:40,41
are, then this smooth.


294
0:13:40,41 --> 0:13:41,74
The smooth has other
functions.


295
0:13:41,74 --> 0:13:48,52
It also helps produce hormones
and other fatty compounds, but


296
0:13:48,52 --> 0:13:49,85
I won't go into detail there.


297
0:13:49,85 --> 0:13:50,94
But it just travels.


298
0:13:50,94 --> 0:13:53,7
It connects to the
Golgi bodies.


299
0:13:53,7 --> 0:13:56,48
Then the Golgi bodies, the
proteins can bud off and take


300
0:13:56,48 --> 0:13:58,34
a little bit of the
membrane with it.


301
0:13:58,34 --> 0:14:1,9
And this idea of something being
surrounded by a membrane


302
0:14:1,9 --> 0:14:4,4
and just traveling in the cell,
so maybe the protein now


303
0:14:4,4 --> 0:14:6,1
looks like this.


304
0:14:6,1 --> 0:14:6,93
I'm enlarging it.


305
0:14:6,93 --> 0:14:9,38
Maybe the protein is there and
then it took a little bit of


306
0:14:9,38 --> 0:14:12,2
the Golgi body membrane
with it.


307
0:14:12,2 --> 0:14:14,78
This is called a vesicle.


308
0:14:14,78 --> 0:14:17,75
And this right here, let's add
another one right here.


309
0:14:17,75 --> 0:14:19,98
I'm just doing that
to label it.


310
0:14:19,98 --> 0:14:23,16
That's called a vesicle.


311
0:14:23,16 --> 0:14:26,11
And a vesicle is really just
a very general term for


312
0:14:26,11 --> 0:14:30,28
anything, little small things,
mostly proteins, in the cell


313
0:14:30,28 --> 0:14:32,43
that are just floating around,
that are surrounded by their


314
0:14:32,43 --> 0:14:34,32
own little mini-membranes.


315
0:14:34,32 --> 0:14:36,78
And the reason why this
mini-membrane is useful is now


316
0:14:36,78 --> 0:14:39,43
this protein can now
float to the outer


317
0:14:39,43 --> 0:14:40,43
membrane of the cell.


318
0:14:40,43 --> 0:14:42,13
It can also float to other
parts of the cell.


319
0:14:42,13 --> 0:14:43,78
I'm doing a simplification.


320
0:14:43,78 --> 0:14:47,1
And then it can merge either
with the membrane of the cell,


321
0:14:47,1 --> 0:14:50,95
or it can use this membrane,
this little vesicle membrane


322
0:14:50,95 --> 0:14:54,24
it has, to facilitate it getting
out of the cell.


323
0:14:54,24 --> 0:14:56,81
You can imagine that it
eventually, you know this


324
0:14:56,81 --> 0:15:0,43
thing-- let's say this is the
outer membrane of the cell.


325
0:15:0,43 --> 0:15:2,47
And I'm doing a gross
oversimplification.


326
0:15:2,47 --> 0:15:4,23
I'm not even drawing
the bilipid layer.


327
0:15:4,23 --> 0:15:7,58
But just to have a visual
impression of what it might


328
0:15:7,58 --> 0:15:11,88
look like, that's the vesicle
there, the little protein


329
0:15:11,88 --> 0:15:14,68
inside of it, and it gets
closer and closer to the


330
0:15:14,68 --> 0:15:18,53
membrane, and then it can
merge with the membrane


331
0:15:18,53 --> 0:15:20,3
because it's made up
of the same stuff.


332
0:15:20,3 --> 0:15:24,6
It merges with the membrane,
your protein inside.


333
0:15:24,6 --> 0:15:26,25
I switched colors arbitrarily.


334
0:15:26,25 --> 0:15:28,14
But now, all of a sudden, once
it merges with the membrane,


335
0:15:28,14 --> 0:15:31,92
then the protein can exit the
actual cell, or maybe it can


336
0:15:31,92 --> 0:15:35,21
actually embed itself within
this membrane, within the


337
0:15:35,21 --> 0:15:39,2
outer cellular membrane, which
I drew very thin, but it has


338
0:15:39,2 --> 0:15:39,96
two layers to it.


339
0:15:39,96 --> 0:15:40,97
And we'll talk more
about that.


340
0:15:40,97 --> 0:15:44,13
And I could probably make
a whole video on it.


341
0:15:44,13 --> 0:15:47,97
So those are-- we've already
made pretty good progress on


342
0:15:47,97 --> 0:15:49,4
showing the anatomy
of the cell.


343
0:15:49,4 --> 0:15:52,36
There are a few other things
we can throw in there.


344
0:15:52,36 --> 0:15:58,86
There are things called
lysosomes, which exist in


345
0:15:58,86 --> 0:16:3,84
animal cells that contain
enzymes in them that help


346
0:16:3,84 --> 0:16:5,155
dissolve other things.


347
0:16:5,155 --> 0:16:8,72



348
0:16:8,72 --> 0:16:12,5
So if a lysosome attaches to
something else and is able to


349
0:16:12,5 --> 0:16:14,95
spew its enzymes into it,
it usually kills it.


350
0:16:14,95 --> 0:16:16,14
It usually digests it.


351
0:16:16,14 --> 0:16:18,1
So that's what a
lysosome does.


352
0:16:18,1 --> 0:16:23,31
In plants, you have things
called lytic vacuoles, and


353
0:16:23,31 --> 0:16:25,6
those are really the same thing
as a lysosome in terms


354
0:16:25,6 --> 0:16:28,28
of their function in that
they're really big vesicles.


355
0:16:28,28 --> 0:16:31,59
In fact, in general, a vacuole
is just a big vesicle.


356
0:16:31,59 --> 0:16:36,63
It's just a general term for a
big membrane-bound organelle.


357
0:16:36,63 --> 0:16:38,43
Vacuole.


358
0:16:38,43 --> 0:16:40,28
And once again, what's
an organelle?


359
0:16:40,28 --> 0:16:42,0
Let me write down that word.


360
0:16:42,0 --> 0:16:44,73
Organelle.


361
0:16:44,73 --> 0:16:48,78
It's just a membrane-bound
subunit of a cell.


362
0:16:48,78 --> 0:16:51,43
Just like my liver is a subunit
of Sal and it's an


363
0:16:51,43 --> 0:16:55,48
organ, an organelle is
a subunit of a cell.


364
0:16:55,48 --> 0:16:59,2
So a vacuole is just a general
term for a membrane-bound


365
0:16:59,2 --> 0:17:2,29
organelle that stores stuff
inside of our cells.


366
0:17:2,29 --> 0:17:5,79



367
0:17:5,79 --> 0:17:8,4
So a lytic vacuole would be a
vacuole in a plant cell that


368
0:17:8,4 --> 0:17:10,44
stores a bunch of enzymes, and
if it were attached to


369
0:17:10,44 --> 0:17:12,619
something else it would dissolve
it if it were able to


370
0:17:12,619 --> 0:17:16,69
spew its enzymes into
the other thing.


371
0:17:16,69 --> 0:17:19,5
Now, there's several organelles
that we've talked


372
0:17:19,5 --> 0:17:21,23
about within the context
of respiration and


373
0:17:21,23 --> 0:17:24,619
photosynthesis, and I go into
detail in those videos.


374
0:17:24,619 --> 0:17:28,39
But we have things called
mitochondria.


375
0:17:28,39 --> 0:17:30,7
Mitochondrion cells.


376
0:17:30,7 --> 0:17:33,61
And they have inner and outer
membranes, and this is where


377
0:17:33,61 --> 0:17:38,47
we produce our energy, where
sugars are turned into ATP.


378
0:17:38,47 --> 0:17:40,27
I've done detailed
videos on this.


379
0:17:40,27 --> 0:17:43,35
These actually contain their own
DNA, and they can actually


380
0:17:43,35 --> 0:17:50,7
reproduce on their own, which
makes people believe that they


381
0:17:50,7 --> 0:17:54,78
exist-- that their ancestors
once existed as independent


382
0:17:54,78 --> 0:17:59,91
prokaryotic organisms, that at
some point they just kind of


383
0:17:59,91 --> 0:18:3,715
stumbled upon the notion of,
hey, why don't I live inside


384
0:18:3,715 --> 0:18:6,65
of other organisms and kind
of live in symbiosis?


385
0:18:6,65 --> 0:18:11,2
So mitochondria, these are
organelles that at one time


386
0:18:11,2 --> 0:18:13,14
their ancestors might have been
independent prokaryotes.


387
0:18:13,14 --> 0:18:17,39



388
0:18:17,39 --> 0:18:19,4
Mitochondria.


389
0:18:19,4 --> 0:18:22,81
That's where cellular
respiration takes part, and we


390
0:18:22,81 --> 0:18:23,75
go into detail on that.


391
0:18:23,75 --> 0:18:26,64
And then on the plant cells,
this is only in-- well,


392
0:18:26,64 --> 0:18:29,83
definitely not in animal cells--
you have chloroplasts,


393
0:18:29,83 --> 0:18:31,9
which are a subset of things
called plastids, but


394
0:18:31,9 --> 0:18:33,99
chloroplasts are the
most famous.


395
0:18:33,99 --> 0:18:37,13
Maybe I should do that in
especially green, green.


396
0:18:37,13 --> 0:18:38,32
So we have chloroplasts.


397
0:18:38,32 --> 0:18:39,98
And we know they have little
thylakoids in there.


398
0:18:39,98 --> 0:18:41,75
This is where photosynthesis
takes place.


399
0:18:41,75 --> 0:18:43,27
You have your grana
and all of that.


400
0:18:43,27 --> 0:18:45,84
And I do go into detail in the
photosynthesis videos, but


401
0:18:45,84 --> 0:18:46,28
it's good to know.


402
0:18:46,28 --> 0:18:48,68
These are other organelles.


403
0:18:48,68 --> 0:18:51,95
And just like mitochondria, they
have their own DNA and


404
0:18:51,95 --> 0:18:53,44
their own ribosomes.


405
0:18:53,44 --> 0:18:56,78
And so the belief is that they
were once independent


406
0:18:56,78 --> 0:19:1,21
prokaryotes that learned to live
in symbiosis inside of


407
0:19:1,21 --> 0:19:4,9
larger eukaryotic cells.


408
0:19:4,9 --> 0:19:6,36
So we're almost done, really,
with the structure cells.


409
0:19:6,36 --> 0:19:8,62
There's other things we
can throw on here.


410
0:19:8,62 --> 0:19:12,8
If we're dealing with plant
cells or non-animal cells,


411
0:19:12,8 --> 0:19:15,8
we'll have something called a
cell wall, which will give


412
0:19:15,8 --> 0:19:17,38
some strength to the
outer membrane.


413
0:19:17,38 --> 0:19:19,9
You can kind of view
it that way, or it


414
0:19:19,9 --> 0:19:21,68
gives it some rigidity.


415
0:19:21,68 --> 0:19:23,48
So you have things called cell
walls, although they're not


416
0:19:23,48 --> 0:19:25,43
necessarily completely rigid.


417
0:19:25,43 --> 0:19:27,46
You can almost view them as
balloons that provide just a


418
0:19:27,46 --> 0:19:29,33
little bit more rigidity.


419
0:19:29,33 --> 0:19:32,53
Things like wood actually have
double cell walls for really


420
0:19:32,53 --> 0:19:33,4
hard-core rigidity.


421
0:19:33,4 --> 0:19:37,16
So this is a cell wall.


422
0:19:37,16 --> 0:19:39,17
This is in non-animals.


423
0:19:39,17 --> 0:19:43,81
And in plants it's made out of
cellulose, not cellulite.


424
0:19:43,81 --> 0:19:44,71
That used to confuse me.


425
0:19:44,71 --> 0:19:47,84
So this gives extra rigidity
or form to


426
0:19:47,84 --> 0:19:49,51
the cellular membrane.


427
0:19:49,51 --> 0:19:53,71
And then to actually give the
cell its actual structure, you


428
0:19:53,71 --> 0:19:56,45
have these things called
microfilaments, or sometimes


429
0:19:56,45 --> 0:19:58,89
actin filaments, and these are
these little pipes that go


430
0:19:58,89 --> 0:20:0,17
throughout the cell.


431
0:20:0,17 --> 0:20:3,81
These actually help give the
cell its actual structure in


432
0:20:3,81 --> 0:20:5,88
three dimensions, and actually,
they can participate


433
0:20:5,88 --> 0:20:8,15
in things moving around within
the cell or even the cell


434
0:20:8,15 --> 0:20:9,91
moving around itself.


435
0:20:9,91 --> 0:20:11,78
And just to be complete and
make sure we're covering


436
0:20:11,78 --> 0:20:15,62
everything, if you watch the
mitosis and meiosis videos,


437
0:20:15,62 --> 0:20:18,8
you have these things
called centrioles.


438
0:20:18,8 --> 0:20:19,94
I go into detail there.


439
0:20:19,94 --> 0:20:24,66
Centrioles that are right
outside of the nucleus.


440
0:20:24,66 --> 0:20:28,15
Two centrioles that are at right
angles to each other


441
0:20:28,15 --> 0:20:32,8
make up a centrosome, and they
kind of coordinate the


442
0:20:32,8 --> 0:20:36,87
microtubules when we start
splitting the cells in mitosis


443
0:20:36,87 --> 0:20:37,76
and meiosis.


444
0:20:37,76 --> 0:20:38,71
I won't go into detail there.


445
0:20:38,71 --> 0:20:40,49
I've done many videos
on that as well.


446
0:20:40,49 --> 0:20:42,93
But so far, this is pretty much
everything you need to


447
0:20:42,93 --> 0:20:46,86
know-- or at least a first
overview-- of the


448
0:20:46,86 --> 0:20:48,7
structure of the cell.


449
0:20:48,7 --> 0:20:50,96
And in one video, we finally
got it all in one place.


450
0:20:50,96 --> 0:20:54,6
This is pretty much-- I haven't
delved into detail on


451
0:20:54,6 --> 0:20:57,17
everything-- on all of the
major pieces of the cell.


452
0:20:57,17 --> 0:21:0,82
So hopefully, you have a better
big-picture view of how


453
0:21:0,82 --> 0:23:0,82
things are organized
inside of it.
