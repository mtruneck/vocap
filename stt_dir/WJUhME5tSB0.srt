1
0:0:0,166 --> 0:0:1,0
Speaker:
Welcome, everyone.


2
0:0:1,0 --> 0:0:7,4
(applause)


3
0:0:7,4 --> 0:0:11,734
I want to start to frame
the day a little bit,


4
0:0:11,734 --> 0:0:17,467
so that you know how we approach
this work and how we approach


5
0:0:17,467 --> 0:0:18,7
our partnership with you.


6
0:0:18,7 --> 0:0:24,967
First of all, no one gets
anywhere on their own.


7
0:0:24,967 --> 0:0:27,9
We have all had mentors.


8
0:0:27,9 --> 0:0:33,7
And I have been really blessed
to have two terrific mentors


9
0:0:33,7 --> 0:0:36,2
in my life among many others.


10
0:0:36,2 --> 0:0:38,767
But two very special ones.


11
0:0:38,767 --> 0:0:43,433
When I was a young college
student thinking about going to


12
0:0:43,433 --> 0:0:48,633
law school, I talked my way into
a job as a paralegal in this


13
0:0:48,633 --> 0:0:51,3
big law firm in Chicago.


14
0:0:51,3 --> 0:0:55,133
And anyone who was foolish
enough to make eye contact with


15
0:0:55,133 --> 0:0:57,767
me, I asked them what they did.


16
0:0:57,767 --> 0:1:4,166
And there was a young attorney
who spent some time with me.


17
0:1:4,166 --> 0:1:7,834
And invited me into her office.


18
0:1:7,834 --> 0:1:10,7
Told me what she
did for a living.


19
0:1:10,7 --> 0:1:14,433
Gave me an opportunity to
ask her some questions.


20
0:1:14,433 --> 0:1:17,0
Basically, she invested in me.


21
0:1:17,0 --> 0:1:24,2
And, and she saw something in
me that I didn't see in myself.


22
0:1:24,2 --> 0:1:27,33
She later introduced
me to her fiance,


23
0:1:27,33 --> 0:1:34,367
this hot shot young
lawyer named Barack Obama.


24
0:1:34,367 --> 0:1:39,834
And I really can say that
having known the two of them as


25
0:1:39,834 --> 0:1:47,3
long as I have, I am a better
professional, a better husband,


26
0:1:47,3 --> 0:1:51,133
a better father from
their example and from


27
0:1:51,133 --> 0:1:52,133
their mentorship.


28
0:1:52,133 --> 0:1:59,1
And so I really try to go out
of my way personally to mentor


29
0:1:59,1 --> 0:2:1,9
anyone that I have had
the opportunity to do so.


30
0:2:1,9 --> 0:2:7,266
And I am surrounded by people
here at the White House who


31
0:2:7,266 --> 0:2:11,3
have the same ethic and
who feel the same way.


32
0:2:11,3 --> 0:2:16,8
And at a time of such
turmoil, such volatility,


33
0:2:16,8 --> 0:2:21,467
such economic hardship,
mentoring is even more


34
0:2:21,467 --> 0:2:23,266
important.


35
0:2:23,266 --> 0:2:27,6
And, and you know that taking a
little bit of time in someone's


36
0:2:27,6 --> 0:2:30,767
life, it doesn't just do
something for the person


37
0:2:30,767 --> 0:2:34,433
that you have the
opportunity to mentor.


38
0:2:34,433 --> 0:2:37,367
It does something for yourself.


39
0:2:37,367 --> 0:2:40,367
Participating in your community,
making your community a better


40
0:2:40,367 --> 0:2:43,9
place to live, it
helps all of us.


41
0:2:43,9 --> 0:2:47,4
And so we have brought that
work into the White House.


42
0:2:47,4 --> 0:2:50,7
We have had a great partnership
with you, Big Brothers,


43
0:2:50,7 --> 0:2:52,734
Big Sisters.


44
0:2:52,734 --> 0:2:57,166
We have started our own
mentoring program here.


45
0:2:57,166 --> 0:3:2,367
The Boys Mentoring Program
about 20 young men,


46
0:3:2,367 --> 0:3:5,734
high school age from the
Washington, D.C. area,


47
0:3:5,734 --> 0:3:10,166
that are hooked up with White
House staffers as mentors.


48
0:3:10,166 --> 0:3:14,2
They have done amazing things.


49
0:3:14,2 --> 0:3:17,7
20 young women who are
from the Washington,


50
0:3:17,7 --> 0:3:21,333
D.C. area participated in the
White House Mentoring Program.


51
0:3:21,333 --> 0:3:24,5
I keep hearing from staffers
what a great opportunity


52
0:3:24,5 --> 0:3:26,934
it is for them.


53
0:3:26,934 --> 0:3:29,233
Mentor, mentees have got
a chance to do a couple


54
0:3:29,233 --> 0:3:30,233
of cool things.


55
0:3:30,233 --> 0:3:31,767
They have visited
the Supreme Court.


56
0:3:31,767 --> 0:3:34,7
They have had a chance
to visit Air Force One.


57
0:3:34,7 --> 0:3:36,0
They have hung out with Bo.


58
0:3:36,0 --> 0:3:37,9
(laughter)


59
0:3:37,9 --> 0:3:40,0
And they have met the
President and the First Lady


60
0:3:40,0 --> 0:3:41,633
of the United States.


61
0:3:41,633 --> 0:3:43,567
We just had a graduation
ceremony for those


62
0:3:43,567 --> 0:3:44,567
who graduated.


63
0:3:44,567 --> 0:3:47,8
And for, for the entire
program that graduated just


64
0:3:47,8 --> 0:3:48,8
this past weekend.


65
0:3:48,8 --> 0:3:52,667
We are about to bring on
another 40 young men and


66
0:3:52,667 --> 0:3:53,6
women into the White House.


67
0:3:53,6 --> 0:3:58,433
So we have, we have done this
ourselves because we know what,


68
0:3:58,433 --> 0:4:0,734
what a privilege
it is to be here.


69
0:4:0,734 --> 0:4:5,433
And our responsibility to
reach out and help others.


70
0:4:5,433 --> 0:4:11,1
And so we have a lot of groups
that come into the White House


71
0:4:11,1 --> 0:4:13,1
and sit down, and,
and, and talk with us.


72
0:4:13,1 --> 0:4:16,0
And we are going to have a
parade of senior officials who


73
0:4:16,0 --> 0:4:19,533
want to come in and meet
you and share a little bit


74
0:4:19,533 --> 0:4:20,533
about what we are doing.


75
0:4:20,533 --> 0:4:23,1
Because we know something else.


76
0:4:23,1 --> 0:4:26,533
You all are leaders
in your community.


77
0:4:26,533 --> 0:4:28,533
People follow you.


78
0:4:28,533 --> 0:4:30,1
People listen to you.


79
0:4:30,1 --> 0:4:31,8
You have credibility.


80
0:4:31,8 --> 0:4:34,166
And so when you go
back home and just,


81
0:4:34,166 --> 0:4:35,8
just tell them a
little bit about us.


82
0:4:35,8 --> 0:4:38,4
You know, sometimes people
can get a bit cynical


83
0:4:38,4 --> 0:4:39,4
about government.


84
0:4:39,4 --> 0:4:41,834
Tell them what you saw.


85
0:4:41,834 --> 0:4:43,467
Tell them what you learned.


86
0:4:43,467 --> 0:4:45,33
Tell them what you
thought was great.


87
0:4:45,33 --> 0:4:48,867
Tell them what you thought was
full of beans and all of that.


88
0:4:48,867 --> 0:4:50,734
But just the fact that
you are engaging with us


89
0:4:50,734 --> 0:4:51,834
I think is important.


90
0:4:51,834 --> 0:4:53,467
It is important to us.


91
0:4:53,467 --> 0:4:54,667
I hope it is important to you.


92
0:4:54,667 --> 0:4:59,233
And it will be important
to, to the people back home.


93
0:4:59,233 --> 0:5:4,33
So with that, I want to
turn this over to a, a,


94
0:5:4,33 --> 0:5:9,166
a young attorney, who I first
met when he was a college


95
0:5:9,166 --> 0:5:10,9
student at the
University of Illinois.


96
0:5:10,9 --> 0:5:14,333
He graduated and went
on to the law school,


97
0:5:14,333 --> 0:5:15,467
started his own practice.


98
0:5:15,467 --> 0:5:17,266
He was doing pretty
well until I told him,


99
0:5:17,266 --> 0:5:18,6
forget about all of that.


100
0:5:18,6 --> 0:5:20,166
I need you to come
to Washington,


101
0:5:20,166 --> 0:5:22,467
D.C. and take a
gigantic pay cut.


102
0:5:22,467 --> 0:5:25,8
And, and come work with me.


103
0:5:25,8 --> 0:5:29,8
He is the leader of
Disability Outreach.


104
0:5:29,8 --> 0:5:33,433
And the leader of Disability
Policy for the Domestic Policy


105
0:5:33,433 --> 0:5:35,133
Council, Kareem Dale.


106
0:5:35,133 --> 0:5:35,967
Thanks, Kareem.


107
0:5:35,967 --> 0:5:42,8
(applause)


108
0:5:42,8 --> 0:5:44,2
I was going to give you
a different introduction.


109
0:5:44,2 --> 0:5:45,633
But then I saw you
standing there.


110
0:5:45,633 --> 0:5:47,3
So I knew you could hear me.


111
0:5:47,3 --> 0:5:48,3
Thanks, everyone.


112
0:5:48,3 --> 0:5:49,233
See you later.


113
0:5:49,233 --> 0:5:53,567
(applause)


114
0:5:53,567 --> 0:5:54,2
Kareem Dale:
All right.


115
0:5:54,2 --> 0:5:54,667
Thanks.


116
0:5:54,667 --> 0:5:55,5
Thanks, Mike.


117
0:5:55,5 --> 0:5:58,367
And welcome to the White
House to everybody.


118
0:5:58,367 --> 0:6:1,433
And we are certainly thrilled
to have all of you all here.


119
0:6:1,433 --> 0:6:5,66
And for those who may be
watching on line on the live


120
0:6:5,66 --> 0:6:9,767
stream, we are certainly pleased
to have all of you all watching


121
0:6:9,767 --> 0:6:10,934
on line as well.


122
0:6:10,934 --> 0:6:13,767
So we have a good agenda
for you all today.


123
0:6:13,767 --> 0:6:16,433
Hopefully, everybody
has picked up the agenda


124
0:6:16,433 --> 0:6:17,867
when you walked in.


125
0:6:17,867 --> 0:6:22,33
I will kind of be back and forth
periodically to bridge the gap


126
0:6:22,33 --> 0:6:24,567
between different folks and
to give you some additional


127
0:6:24,567 --> 0:6:25,934
information about
what we are doing,


128
0:6:25,934 --> 0:6:29,6
things we are doing here at the
White House that we think are,


129
0:6:29,6 --> 0:6:31,533
we think was very
interesting to you all.


130
0:6:31,533 --> 0:6:33,633
We think it is beneficial
for you all to know.


131
0:6:33,633 --> 0:6:37,1
But we also think it is
beneficial from our stand point


132
0:6:37,1 --> 0:6:39,934
to make sure that you know
what the President is doing,


133
0:6:39,934 --> 0:6:42,5
what the President is up to,
what our administration is up


134
0:6:42,5 --> 0:6:46,5
to, and what the White
House at large is up to.


135
0:6:46,5 --> 0:6:51,5
So we obviously have coming up
next Tina Tchen who is the


136
0:6:51,5 --> 0:6:52,9
First Lady's Chief of Staff.


137
0:6:52,9 --> 0:6:55,4
And Tina will be here
in a few minutes.


138
0:6:55,4 --> 0:7:1,633
And then we have George
Sheldon from the -- sorry.


139
0:7:1,633 --> 0:7:4,734
Next after Tina
is Joshua DuBois.


140
0:7:4,734 --> 0:7:8,233
Who is the head of our faith
office and then we also


141
0:7:8,233 --> 0:7:9,7
have George Sheldon.


142
0:7:9,7 --> 0:7:12,1
Then to be concluded by
the Attorney General.


143
0:7:12,1 --> 0:7:15,4
So we have a good line-up
for you all today.


144
0:7:15,4 --> 0:7:18,8
And so let me just talk about
a few things while we wait for


145
0:7:18,8 --> 0:7:21,7
Tina to arrive in
the next few minutes.


146
0:7:21,7 --> 0:7:24,467
As Mike said, I have
two, two roles here.


147
0:7:24,467 --> 0:7:27,734
Well, actually I have
three roles here.


148
0:7:27,734 --> 0:7:30,533
You have three roles plus
whatever else might come up


149
0:7:30,533 --> 0:7:33,333
in the interim that
the administration,


150
0:7:33,333 --> 0:7:36,66
that the President, or Valerie
or anybody else needs you to do.


151
0:7:36,66 --> 0:7:38,2
So we have you know
some designed roles,


152
0:7:38,2 --> 0:7:40,367
but we are the
jack of all trades,


153
0:7:40,367 --> 0:7:42,1
particularly in the Office
of Public Engagement.


154
0:7:42,1 --> 0:7:44,9
So as Mike said, I do
Disability Policy in the


155
0:7:44,9 --> 0:7:46,166
Domestic Policy Council.


156
0:7:46,166 --> 0:7:48,9
I also do in the Office of
Public Engagement which is


157
0:7:48,9 --> 0:7:51,9
Valerie Jarrett, one of Valerie
Jarrett's offices I do outreach


158
0:7:51,9 --> 0:7:53,2
to the disability community.


159
0:7:53,2 --> 0:7:56,633
But I also do outreach
to lawyers and the


160
0:7:56,633 --> 0:7:58,1
civil rights community.


161
0:7:58,1 --> 0:7:59,333
I think I got stuck with that.


162
0:7:59,333 --> 0:8:2,734
Actually, Tina is my former
boss in the Office of Public


163
0:8:2,734 --> 0:8:5,0
Engagement before she went over
to the First Lady's office.


164
0:8:5,0 --> 0:8:7,4
And she is a lawyer
from Chicago as well.


165
0:8:7,4 --> 0:8:10,533
And so I think when she saw that
I was coming, she just decided,


166
0:8:10,533 --> 0:8:12,8
well, I know you, you are
a lawyer from Chicago.


167
0:8:12,8 --> 0:8:13,8
I am a lawyer from Chicago.


168
0:8:13,8 --> 0:8:14,8
So you do lawyers.


169
0:8:14,8 --> 0:8:17,533
So that is, that is how
I got stuck with that.


170
0:8:17,533 --> 0:8:20,7
But, but it has been a good gig.


171
0:8:20,7 --> 0:8:25,33
So within the Office
of Public Engagement,


172
0:8:25,33 --> 0:8:27,233
we do a number of things.


173
0:8:27,233 --> 0:8:30,467
And we are the front
door to the White House.


174
0:8:30,467 --> 0:8:35,467
So it is our job to make sure
that you all know what is going


175
0:8:35,467 --> 0:8:38,33
on here at the White House,
what the President is up to.


176
0:8:38,33 --> 0:8:42,166
It is our job to make sure that
we are communicating to you all


177
0:8:42,166 --> 0:8:45,734
as constituents about things
that are important to you,


178
0:8:45,734 --> 0:8:48,233
and to your communities
across the country.


179
0:8:48,233 --> 0:8:50,767
It is also our job
to listen to you.


180
0:8:50,767 --> 0:8:54,734
And to bring you to events like
this and briefings so you can


181
0:8:54,734 --> 0:8:57,934
hear from us, but that
also we can hear from you.


182
0:8:57,934 --> 0:9:0,433
And you will, you will have a
chance to ask questions to


183
0:9:0,433 --> 0:9:2,867
some of our, some of
our briefers today.


184
0:9:2,867 --> 0:9:5,734
We want to have a
chance to hear from you.


185
0:9:5,734 --> 0:9:7,467
And to make sure that we
understand where you


186
0:9:7,467 --> 0:9:8,467
are coming from.


187
0:9:8,467 --> 0:9:11,333
And this is something that we,
we do quite a bit here in the


188
0:9:11,333 --> 0:9:14,2
Office of Public Engagement
bringing in constituents really


189
0:9:14,2 --> 0:9:16,533
from around the country,
Democrats, Republican,


190
0:9:16,533 --> 0:9:17,533
Independents.


191
0:9:17,533 --> 0:9:18,533
It doesn't matter to us.


192
0:9:18,533 --> 0:9:21,367
We want to hear from all
Americans to make sure that that


193
0:9:21,367 --> 0:9:25,8
is, that you all are advising
us on what you think our policy


194
0:9:25,8 --> 0:9:28,767
should be related to,
to your communities.


195
0:9:28,767 --> 0:9:32,533
And so we have developed a
number of different tools


196
0:9:32,533 --> 0:9:33,967
and so that we can do that.


197
0:9:33,967 --> 0:9:36,166
And so that we
can hear from you.


198
0:9:36,166 --> 0:9:38,166
And so that we can understand
where you are coming from.


199
0:9:38,166 --> 0:9:40,867
But also so that, so that
you can hear from us.


200
0:9:40,867 --> 0:9:43,33
Our new director,
our new director,


201
0:9:43,33 --> 0:9:44,266
I guess he is no longer new.


202
0:9:44,266 --> 0:9:47,0
I know he has been
here for maybe, gosh,


203
0:9:47,0 --> 0:9:50,233
I think John has been here
since December or November now.


204
0:9:50,233 --> 0:9:51,233
I lose track.


205
0:9:51,233 --> 0:9:54,233
I have been here
since day one, so it,


206
0:9:54,233 --> 0:9:56,633
it gets a little -- things
get a little run together.


207
0:9:56,633 --> 0:9:58,3
But john has been
here several months,


208
0:9:58,3 --> 0:10:2,233
John Carson is our Director of
the Office of Public Engagement


209
0:10:2,233 --> 0:10:6,66
and so he has developed a number
of tools for us to communicate


210
0:10:6,66 --> 0:10:7,8
with everybody
throughout the country.


211
0:10:7,8 --> 0:10:11,33
And so let me just tell you
about -- let me make sure --


212
0:10:11,33 --> 0:10:14,333
Catherine, Tina is
not here yet, right?


213
0:10:14,333 --> 0:10:15,834
Catherine?


214
0:10:15,834 --> 0:10:17,467
Catherine:
No, she is not.


215
0:10:17,467 --> 0:10:17,934
Kareem Dale:
Okay.


216
0:10:17,934 --> 0:10:17,467
All right. She is all right.


217
0:10:17,467 --> 0:10:20,33
While we are, I am going to
tell you about a couple of these


218
0:10:20,33 --> 0:10:22,9
tools that I think are
beneficial to you all,


219
0:10:22,9 --> 0:10:24,333
that you all should know about.


220
0:10:24,333 --> 0:10:27,233
One of those tools
is what is called a


221
0:10:27,233 --> 0:10:29,233
Community Leaders Briefing.


222
0:10:29,233 --> 0:10:32,8
And the Community
Leaders Briefing is,


223
0:10:32,8 --> 0:10:36,834
it is actually not that much
different than what we are doing


224
0:10:36,834 --> 0:10:38,266
today with you all.


225
0:10:38,266 --> 0:10:40,8
What we do is we
bring in leaders,


226
0:10:40,8 --> 0:10:44,266
community leaders from a
particular constituency or a


227
0:10:44,266 --> 0:10:47,8
particular place in the country
or particular group of people


228
0:10:47,8 --> 0:10:50,1
that are leaders in
their local communities.


229
0:10:50,1 --> 0:10:52,667
That are doing great things,
that are leading their


230
0:10:52,667 --> 0:10:55,433
communities across the country.


231
0:10:55,433 --> 0:10:59,1
And we bring those community
leaders in and we have a


232
0:10:59,1 --> 0:11:2,433
dialogue with White House
administration officials.


233
0:11:2,433 --> 0:11:6,66
And while house officials and
administration officials from


234
0:11:6,66 --> 0:11:7,367
particular agencies.


235
0:11:7,367 --> 0:11:11,0
So we'll bring in those
community or we'll bring in 100


236
0:11:11,0 --> 0:11:16,266
to 150 leaders, they will have
a chance to come here and hear


237
0:11:16,266 --> 0:11:18,967
from administration officials
which is the part that is very


238
0:11:18,967 --> 0:11:21,6
similar to what we
are doing here today.


239
0:11:21,6 --> 0:11:23,467
You will have a
chance to hear from,


240
0:11:23,467 --> 0:11:25,1
hear from administration
officials in


241
0:11:25,1 --> 0:11:26,133
their relevant areas.


242
0:11:26,133 --> 0:11:27,5
We'll do a briefing.


243
0:11:27,5 --> 0:11:28,5
We'll do that here.


244
0:11:28,5 --> 0:11:30,8
They will have a chance to ask
questions and then we'll have


245
0:11:30,8 --> 0:11:34,8
break out sessions in the
afternoon where those,


246
0:11:34,8 --> 0:11:38,33
those leaders break up into
you know four or five, six,


247
0:11:38,33 --> 0:11:41,133
different break out groups and
have a chance to ask questions


248
0:11:41,133 --> 0:11:44,467
of administration officials and
really kind of dig down deep


249
0:11:44,467 --> 0:11:46,9
into some of the issues
that are concerning them in


250
0:11:46,9 --> 0:11:48,166
their local communities.


251
0:11:48,166 --> 0:11:50,567
And it is just another way
for us to reach out to


252
0:11:50,567 --> 0:11:51,567
local communities.


253
0:11:51,567 --> 0:11:54,834
Because, you know, we get kind
of tied up here in Washington


254
0:11:54,834 --> 0:11:57,5
and we think the world
only exists in Washington.


255
0:11:57,5 --> 0:12:0,8
But we realize we need to be
communicating and talking to


256
0:12:0,8 --> 0:12:2,533
communities across the country.


257
0:12:2,533 --> 0:12:4,8
So that is one way
that we do that.


258
0:12:4,8 --> 0:12:8,867
So I say that to say that you
should go out and check out our


259
0:12:8,867 --> 0:12:11,433
website, the Office of Public
Engagement website on the White


260
0:12:11,433 --> 0:12:14,4
House website and you know
if you think that there is an


261
0:12:14,4 --> 0:12:16,633
opportunity that community
leaders briefing,


262
0:12:16,633 --> 0:12:22,2
that you think oh, these set
of or group of persons or a


263
0:12:22,2 --> 0:12:25,6
particular constituency, might
be interested in having a


264
0:12:25,6 --> 0:12:27,166
community, community
leaders briefing,


265
0:12:27,166 --> 0:12:30,633
then you can email me and we'll,
we'll, we'll take a look at it.


266
0:12:30,633 --> 0:12:31,633
And we'll consider it.


267
0:12:31,633 --> 0:12:35,9
And we'll figure out if
there is a way to do it.


268
0:12:35,9 --> 0:12:38,33
Obviously, we are doing this
already for Big Brothers,


269
0:12:38,33 --> 0:12:39,33
Big Sisters.


270
0:12:39,33 --> 0:12:40,2
So it will be
something different.


271
0:12:40,2 --> 0:12:42,0
But that you might
be, I am sure you all,


272
0:12:42,0 --> 0:12:44,667
all of you are involved in other
organizations and other groups


273
0:12:44,667 --> 0:12:45,667
and things of that nature.


274
0:12:45,667 --> 0:12:47,667
So that is one, one idea.


275
0:12:47,667 --> 0:12:50,6
The second thing, second tool
that we have done in order to


276
0:12:50,6 --> 0:12:54,1
highlight people that are doing
great things around the country,


277
0:12:54,1 --> 0:12:55,767
we have created
Champions Of Change.


278
0:12:55,767 --> 0:12:59,633
Let me ask, how many people
have actually heard of community


279
0:12:59,633 --> 0:13:1,734
leaders briefing or
Champions Of Change?


280
0:13:1,734 --> 0:13:3,367
Have any of you
all heard of that?


281
0:13:3,367 --> 0:13:4,734
If you raise your
hands, I am blind,


282
0:13:4,734 --> 0:13:6,0
if you didn't see the cane.


283
0:13:6,0 --> 0:13:8,233
Please don't, don't
raise your hand you know.


284
0:13:8,233 --> 0:13:9,967
You all are the ones
that look crazy, not me.


285
0:13:9,967 --> 0:13:11,133
(laughter)


286
0:13:11,133 --> 0:13:14,734
Because I know I am blind, so
if you all didn't see the cane,


287
0:13:14,734 --> 0:13:18,0
you all want to look like oh,
duh, why did I raise my hand?


288
0:13:18,0 --> 0:13:19,433
He can't see me.


289
0:13:19,433 --> 0:13:23,33
So maybe just clap for
any of those that have,


290
0:13:23,33 --> 0:13:25,33
that have heard of Community
Leaders Briefing or


291
0:13:25,33 --> 0:13:26,433
Champions Of Change.


292
0:13:26,433 --> 0:13:27,433
Okay.


293
0:13:27,433 --> 0:13:28,4
A few of you all.


294
0:13:28,4 --> 0:13:29,4
A few of you all.


295
0:13:29,4 --> 0:13:30,4
All right.


296
0:13:30,4 --> 0:13:31,4
Not nearly enough, though.


297
0:13:31,4 --> 0:13:34,934
So Champions Of Change was
something that we developed to


298
0:13:34,934 --> 0:13:37,8
really highlight people
that are really doing great


299
0:13:37,8 --> 0:13:38,8
things around the country.


300
0:13:38,8 --> 0:13:40,2
I will give you an example.


301
0:13:40,2 --> 0:13:42,934
We did a Champions Of Change
in my disability role.


302
0:13:42,934 --> 0:13:46,367
We did a Champions Of Change
for those persons who are doing


303
0:13:46,367 --> 0:13:49,967
great things in STEM, science,
technology, engineering,


304
0:13:49,967 --> 0:13:51,967
and math for people
with disabilities.


305
0:13:51,967 --> 0:13:53,567
And we had some you
know great people.


306
0:13:53,567 --> 0:13:56,967
Actually it was --
we had some really,


307
0:13:56,967 --> 0:14:0,467
really great people and
there were stories done.


308
0:14:0,467 --> 0:14:3,9
In various news outlets
or really across the country,


309
0:14:3,9 --> 0:14:5,5
a lot of good publicity.


310
0:14:5,5 --> 0:14:9,6
And we highlight generally about
12 to 14 people and we bring


311
0:14:9,6 --> 0:14:11,934
them into the White
House, we highlight them,


312
0:14:11,934 --> 0:14:14,834
we do a blog about
it, we tweet about it,


313
0:14:14,834 --> 0:14:19,266
and we do a couple of
different panel discussions.


314
0:14:19,266 --> 0:14:21,934
We do panel discussions with
the different champions to talk


315
0:14:21,934 --> 0:14:22,33
about the issues.


316
0:14:22,33 --> 0:14:25,233
And we invite you know a
hundred or so people to come in.


317
0:14:25,233 --> 0:14:28,4
Their guests as well as
different people from that


318
0:14:28,4 --> 0:14:30,767
particular community
to come in and listen to the


319
0:14:30,767 --> 0:14:31,767
panel discussions.


320
0:14:31,767 --> 0:14:34,33
We also give the champions
a tour of the White House,


321
0:14:34,33 --> 0:14:39,266
and it is just a great way
to really signal that our,


322
0:14:39,266 --> 0:14:42,533
our belief that it is not
only about government.


323
0:14:42,533 --> 0:14:45,934
It is not government alone that
is going to make a difference


324
0:14:45,934 --> 0:14:48,3
in our communities, but it is
people like you all that


325
0:14:48,3 --> 0:14:50,166
are going to make a
difference everyday.


326
0:14:50,166 --> 0:14:52,834
And it is a chance for us
to highlight some of those


327
0:14:52,834 --> 0:14:55,533
champions that are really
doing phenomenal things.


328
0:14:55,533 --> 0:14:57,4
If you take a look at
our Champions website,


329
0:14:57,4 --> 0:15:0,367
you will see we have had
champions in business,


330
0:15:0,367 --> 0:15:1,433
in environment.


331
0:15:1,433 --> 0:15:6,2
We have had champions in, in,
I think teachers and just all


332
0:15:6,2 --> 0:15:9,3
sorts of different areas where
we have had Champions Of Change.


333
0:15:9,3 --> 0:15:11,667
And so if you take a look
at that and you think, wow,


334
0:15:11,667 --> 0:15:14,834
I have an idea for a
Champions Of Change program.


335
0:15:14,834 --> 0:15:16,467
You know, let us know.


336
0:15:16,467 --> 0:15:18,967
And we will, we will
also consider that.


337
0:15:18,967 --> 0:15:22,467
So to really those are
two really great tools for


338
0:15:22,467 --> 0:15:23,467
us to get involved.


339
0:15:23,467 --> 0:15:26,734
Let me, let me stop for a
second and take a few questions.


340
0:15:26,734 --> 0:15:29,166
If anybody has questions that
they would want to ask about,


341
0:15:29,166 --> 0:15:32,133
generally the Office of Public
Engagement, the work I do,


342
0:15:32,133 --> 0:15:35,133
while, and then we'll just
have, we'll move into Tina as


343
0:15:35,133 --> 0:15:36,467
soon as Tina gets here.


344
0:15:36,467 --> 0:15:39,734
I have some other stuff I am
going to download for you all as


345
0:15:39,734 --> 0:15:41,567
the briefing progresses.


346
0:15:41,567 --> 0:15:45,166
So any questions right now?


347
0:15:45,166 --> 0:15:48,1
If you have questions, just
you can just shout out.


348
0:15:48,1 --> 0:15:50,2
I don't mind.


349
0:15:50,2 --> 0:15:50,834
Any questions?


350
0:15:50,834 --> 0:15:53,333
Audience Member:
Over here. Just quick question.


351
0:15:53,333 --> 0:15:55,1
Big Brothers and Big
Sisters is pleased to have


352
0:15:55,1 --> 0:15:55,9
the chance to be here.


353
0:15:55,9 --> 0:15:58,533
Thank you very much
for hosting us.


354
0:15:58,533 --> 0:16:0,4
Our local agencies
around the country,


355
0:16:0,4 --> 0:16:4,66
are obviously consider
themselves and have been for


356
0:16:4,66 --> 0:16:6,433
many years, for decades,
leaders in child safety and


357
0:16:6,433 --> 0:16:8,0
in youth outcomes.


358
0:16:8,0 --> 0:16:10,367
One of the things we need in
addition to resources


359
0:16:10,367 --> 0:16:11,967
are more volunteers.


360
0:16:11,967 --> 0:16:14,333
And as, through the Office
of Public Engagement,


361
0:16:14,333 --> 0:16:17,166
are there ways that the White
House can encourage different


362
0:16:17,166 --> 0:16:19,266
constituent groups to come
forward and serve as Big


363
0:16:19,266 --> 0:16:21,667
Brothers, Big Sisters
around the country?


364
0:16:21,667 --> 0:16:24,233
Kareem Dale:
Well, I think, I think
what we have tried to do


365
0:16:24,233 --> 0:16:28,367
is while you know it is, it
gets a little complicated if you


366
0:16:28,367 --> 0:16:30,834
start talking about you know
asking people to volunteer


367
0:16:30,834 --> 0:16:32,834
for specific organizations.


368
0:16:32,834 --> 0:16:35,1
I think what we have tried to do
is the President and the First


369
0:16:35,1 --> 0:16:38,5
Lady have really highlighted
volunteerism and we have put


370
0:16:38,5 --> 0:16:39,533
a big emphasis on that.


371
0:16:39,533 --> 0:16:41,433
And the main emphasis
that has been through,


372
0:16:41,433 --> 0:16:45,333
is through the Corporation For
National Community Service.


373
0:16:45,333 --> 0:16:49,967
And really encouraging people
to get out and volunteer in


374
0:16:49,967 --> 0:16:53,0
your local communities and
organizations that you


375
0:16:53,0 --> 0:16:56,133
appreciate and that
you want to help out.


376
0:16:56,133 --> 0:16:58,7
Now, obviously Big Brothers, Big
Sisters would be one of those


377
0:16:58,7 --> 0:17:3,0
organizations where folks can
volunteer and do mentoring.


378
0:17:3,0 --> 0:17:6,467
But there are obviously many
other organizations as well.


379
0:17:6,467 --> 0:17:10,7
And so obviously I would, I
would encourage I think you all,


380
0:17:10,7 --> 0:17:13,433
I assume you all probably have
a partnership in some capacity


381
0:17:13,433 --> 0:17:16,333
with Corporation for
National Community Service.


382
0:17:16,333 --> 0:17:19,633
If not, we can certainly
help facilitate that,


383
0:17:19,633 --> 0:17:23,33
additional conversations
with the corporation.


384
0:17:23,33 --> 0:17:26,233
But we, we, we believe as
you heard Mike talk about,


385
0:17:26,233 --> 0:17:30,233
we certainly believe in
community service and we are


386
0:17:30,233 --> 0:17:33,767
pushing individuals to volunteer
and get involved in their


387
0:17:33,767 --> 0:17:37,266
communities because the
President and First Lady really


388
0:17:37,266 --> 0:17:39,567
believe in that as well.


389
0:17:39,567 --> 0:17:42,767
So we'll, you know, we can
certainly work on that.


390
0:17:42,767 --> 0:17:44,7
Yup.


391
0:17:44,7 --> 0:17:47,767
Other questions at this point?


392
0:17:47,767 --> 0:17:48,767
Okay.


393
0:17:48,767 --> 0:17:49,166
All right.


394
0:17:49,166 --> 0:17:52,767
So let's, we'll give me a
couple of minutes and we'll


395
0:17:52,767 --> 0:17:54,6
wait for Tina to arrive.


396
0:17:54,6 --> 0:17:56,133
Oh, Tina is here.


397
0:17:56,133 --> 0:17:57,667
Perfect timing.


398
0:17:57,667 --> 0:17:58,967
Perfect timing.


399
0:17:58,967 --> 0:18:2,133
You know, they have been raising
their hands and I told them I


400
0:18:2,133 --> 0:18:4,166
couldn't see them, Tina.


401
0:18:4,166 --> 0:18:4,667
Right at home.


402
0:18:4,667 --> 0:18:9,166
So you heard me talk a little
bit about Tina earlier.


403
0:18:9,166 --> 0:18:12,166
So without further adieu, the
First Lady's Chief Of Staff and


404
0:18:12,166 --> 0:18:14,2
my former boss, Tina Tchen.


405
0:18:14,2 --> 0:18:23,467
(applause)


406
0:18:23,467 --> 0:18:25,433
Tina Tchen:
Thank you, Kareem.


407
0:18:25,433 --> 0:18:30,66
Kareem is you have already
seen sort of one of our best


408
0:18:30,66 --> 0:18:35,734
spokespersons and role models
and is just out you know on all


409
0:18:35,734 --> 0:18:36,934
sorts of issues.


410
0:18:36,934 --> 0:18:39,867
So he has been such a terrific
leader around the country.


411
0:18:39,867 --> 0:18:41,433
And for young people.


412
0:18:41,433 --> 0:18:43,2
I am delighted to be here.


413
0:18:43,2 --> 0:18:45,734
I actually wear two hats
here at the White House.


414
0:18:45,734 --> 0:18:48,867
I am Mrs. Obama's
Chief Of Staff.


415
0:18:48,867 --> 0:18:50,934
And after having served
the first two years of the


416
0:18:50,934 --> 0:18:52,7
administration as the Director
of the Office Of Public


417
0:18:52,7 --> 0:18:55,433
engagement, so that
in former capacity,


418
0:18:55,433 --> 0:18:58,1
I spent a lot of time with Big
Brothers Big Sisters as part of


419
0:18:58,1 --> 0:18:59,166
our outreach efforts.


420
0:18:59,166 --> 0:19:1,767
So I am a great admirer
of the all of the work


421
0:19:1,767 --> 0:19:3,3
that all of you do.


422
0:19:3,3 --> 0:19:6,166
My second hat is I am also the
Executive Director of the White


423
0:19:6,166 --> 0:19:9,6
House Council on Women and
Girls which is chaired by


424
0:19:9,6 --> 0:19:10,533
Valerie Jarrett.


425
0:19:10,533 --> 0:19:13,934
And it is our council consisting
all of the agencies in the


426
0:19:13,934 --> 0:19:17,433
federal government and all of
the major White House offices.


427
0:19:17,433 --> 0:19:20,934
That really promotes pursuant to
the President's directive in the


428
0:19:20,934 --> 0:19:25,6
executive order that he signed
when he created the council back


429
0:19:25,6 --> 0:19:28,367
in March of '09 to make sure
that every part of the federal


430
0:19:28,367 --> 0:19:31,33
government pays attention to
the needs of women and girls in


431
0:19:31,33 --> 0:19:33,567
everything that we do.


432
0:19:33,567 --> 0:19:38,533
And, certainly, making sure that
young women and girls really


433
0:19:38,533 --> 0:19:42,934
reach their full potential in
things like STEM education,


434
0:19:42,934 --> 0:19:46,7
in leadership capacities, in
much of what we all of you do I


435
0:19:46,7 --> 0:19:52,934
know as, as mentors is part of
our mission here and what we do.


436
0:19:52,934 --> 0:19:55,967
For the First Lady's office, as
many of you know from her own


437
0:19:55,967 --> 0:20:1,233
personal history, mentorship
is a concept that she feels


438
0:20:1,233 --> 0:20:3,533
quite strongly about.


439
0:20:3,533 --> 0:20:6,0
Very often times when she
speaks to young people,


440
0:20:6,0 --> 0:20:8,4
not just here in
the United States,


441
0:20:8,4 --> 0:20:12,433
but a key part of many of her
foreign speeches when she,


442
0:20:12,433 --> 0:20:17,66
whether it is in Brazil or in
India or more recently last


443
0:20:17,66 --> 0:20:22,567
summer in South Africa she talks
to young people about her own


444
0:20:22,567 --> 0:20:26,4
personal narrative and
about how, you know,


445
0:20:26,4 --> 0:20:30,7
you can be anything you want
to be and how her own life


446
0:20:30,7 --> 0:20:31,8
story demonstrates that.


447
0:20:31,8 --> 0:20:35,166
And the importance then of
paying it forward and


448
0:20:35,166 --> 0:20:36,367
of mentorship.


449
0:20:36,367 --> 0:20:41,734
Her own personal story as you
all know, one where she after,


450
0:20:41,734 --> 0:20:43,967
you know, graduating from
Princeton, Harvard Law School,


451
0:20:43,967 --> 0:20:48,333
going to work at Sidley Austin
a big national law firm based in


452
0:20:48,333 --> 0:20:53,867
Chicago, then made the decision
to leave that and you know to


453
0:20:53,867 --> 0:20:56,867
work both in city government,
but importantly to work for


454
0:20:56,867 --> 0:20:58,133
public allies.


455
0:20:58,133 --> 0:21:2,33
To really be at the ground level
of that organization that really


456
0:21:2,33 --> 0:21:8,467
promotes young adults working in
inner cities and on programs and


457
0:21:8,467 --> 0:21:11,667
with disconnected youth and
providing that kind of up growth


458
0:21:11,667 --> 0:21:12,367
and mentorship.


459
0:21:12,367 --> 0:21:15,967
And she has seen herself very
much as a mentor to many of


460
0:21:15,967 --> 0:21:18,166
those public allies folks.


461
0:21:18,166 --> 0:21:21,0
And I now see it as we
travel around the country,


462
0:21:21,0 --> 0:21:22,734
more often than not
when we are in a,


463
0:21:22,734 --> 0:21:26,2
in an event and holding some
sort of grass roots rally or


464
0:21:26,2 --> 0:21:29,2
something else, people will
come up having been high school


465
0:21:29,2 --> 0:21:32,4
students that she mentored or
college students who are now


466
0:21:32,4 --> 0:21:34,9
people who are administrators
or executives or work


467
0:21:34,9 --> 0:21:36,4
for state government.


468
0:21:36,4 --> 0:21:39,667
And we have tried to replicate
and model mentorship


469
0:21:39,667 --> 0:21:41,133
here at the White House.


470
0:21:41,133 --> 0:21:44,6
So from early on as many of
you may know, we have had the,


471
0:21:44,6 --> 0:21:47,867
the First Lady started a White
House Mentorship Program.


472
0:21:47,867 --> 0:21:51,266
We will in fact tomorrow hold
a graduation ceremony for our


473
0:21:51,266 --> 0:21:53,934
second group of graduates
who will be graduating


474
0:21:53,934 --> 0:21:55,467
from high school.


475
0:21:55,467 --> 0:21:58,934
We, we started it when we first
got here and had a group of,


476
0:21:58,934 --> 0:22:1,633
of at that point,
sophomores and juniors.


477
0:22:1,633 --> 0:22:4,433
And we graduated that
first group that became


478
0:22:4,433 --> 0:22:5,5
seniors last year.


479
0:22:5,5 --> 0:22:7,3
And our second group this
year, and we have had a


480
0:22:7,3 --> 0:22:8,533
new group come in.


481
0:22:8,533 --> 0:22:11,834
And this year, we had
one for the girls,


482
0:22:11,834 --> 0:22:13,633
because we organized
that from the East Wing.


483
0:22:13,633 --> 0:22:16,266
This year, we told the West
Wing we'll let the boys come in


484
0:22:16,266 --> 0:22:18,867
too and be part of the
graduation ceremony.


485
0:22:18,867 --> 0:22:22,433
The President runs, his staff
runs a mentorship program for


486
0:22:22,433 --> 0:22:24,533
boys as well.


487
0:22:24,533 --> 0:22:26,0
And it is, it has been terrific.


488
0:22:26,0 --> 0:22:27,7
It has been a labor of love
for many of us here


489
0:22:27,7 --> 0:22:29,367
in the White House.


490
0:22:29,367 --> 0:22:33,367
The mentors are a collection
of White House staffers.


491
0:22:33,367 --> 0:22:37,533
And we also do then organize
group events for all of them.


492
0:22:37,533 --> 0:22:40,667
We have had great participation
from places like George


493
0:22:40,667 --> 0:22:44,367
Washington University who has
sent over many of their staff to


494
0:22:44,367 --> 0:22:47,8
do Saturday morning writing
seminars for these kids and


495
0:22:47,8 --> 0:22:48,967
career counseling.


496
0:22:48,967 --> 0:22:52,367
And, you know, we have been able
to take them on visits to Air


497
0:22:52,367 --> 0:22:55,367
Force One and to, to
the Capitol building.


498
0:22:55,367 --> 0:22:58,867
And every year they come with us
to the Women Of Courage Awards


499
0:22:58,867 --> 0:23:2,166
event that Secretary
Clinton gives, gives out.


500
0:23:2,166 --> 0:23:4,367
We have been able to give them
previews of State Dinners.


501
0:23:4,367 --> 0:23:7,9
So it has been, I hope
exciting for them.


502
0:23:7,9 --> 0:23:10,8
It has been tremendously
rewarding for all of us.


503
0:23:10,8 --> 0:23:14,133
Because as -- I don't have
to tell all of you, you know,


504
0:23:14,133 --> 0:23:15,867
mentorship is a two way street.


505
0:23:15,867 --> 0:23:20,3
You know, you get as much out of
it as a mentor as you give and


506
0:23:20,3 --> 0:23:22,4
put in for these young people.


507
0:23:22,4 --> 0:23:25,567
So that has been you know really
a constant theme that I think


508
0:23:25,567 --> 0:23:29,867
the President and the First Lady
have promoted as part of their


509
0:23:29,867 --> 0:23:34,3
overall message in support
of public service as a whole.


510
0:23:34,3 --> 0:23:37,9
It is a theme that carried
through the recent report of


511
0:23:37,9 --> 0:23:40,1
the Commission On Community
Solutions that just finished


512
0:23:40,1 --> 0:23:42,934
it's work last week and
submitted a report to the


513
0:23:42,934 --> 0:23:47,633
President on recommendations
for carrying the work forward to


514
0:23:47,633 --> 0:23:50,233
stay involved with
disconnected youth.


515
0:23:50,233 --> 0:23:53,834
You know, especially our older
youth who are not in school,


516
0:23:53,834 --> 0:23:57,9
not employed, and how
we, we reach those kids.


517
0:23:57,9 --> 0:24:1,166
And in our work that we
recently did in Chicago,


518
0:24:1,166 --> 0:24:6,66
when we hosted the NATO Summit
there about three weeks ago and


519
0:24:6,66 --> 0:24:7,567
what the First Lady
was able to do.


520
0:24:7,567 --> 0:24:10,567
Every part of the summit has
a spousal program where the


521
0:24:10,567 --> 0:24:14,133
spouses of the visiting
leaders participate in


522
0:24:14,133 --> 0:24:15,166
a separate program.


523
0:24:15,166 --> 0:24:20,133
And what we were able to do for
that event was to take those


524
0:24:20,133 --> 0:24:23,734
spouses to the Gary Comer Youth
Center which is a youth center


525
0:24:23,734 --> 0:24:28,867
that Gary Comer, the
founder of Lands End,


526
0:24:28,867 --> 0:24:32,166
created in his old neighborhood
on the south side of Chicago


527
0:24:32,166 --> 0:24:35,66
which is just a few blocks from
where the First Lady grew up.


528
0:24:35,66 --> 0:24:38,333
And it is now a full service
center for youth both after


529
0:24:38,333 --> 0:24:40,5
school and before school
and they started a


530
0:24:40,5 --> 0:24:42,333
charter high school.


531
0:24:42,333 --> 0:24:46,1
And really it is an embodiment
of how people in our community


532
0:24:46,1 --> 0:24:48,433
can be engaged with youth.


533
0:24:48,433 --> 0:24:52,834
And we were able to show that
to the NATO leader spouses.


534
0:24:52,834 --> 0:24:57,734
The First Lady of Norway who is
quite an expert in these having


535
0:24:57,734 --> 0:25:0,6
been to several summits actually
told me it was the best spousal


536
0:25:0,6 --> 0:25:2,233
program they had ever had.


537
0:25:2,233 --> 0:25:4,7
Because they are used to seeing
a lot of museums and lovely


538
0:25:4,7 --> 0:25:9,1
places that are shown off
usually by, by Heads Of State.


539
0:25:9,1 --> 0:25:12,2
They don't often get to see
actually really having an


540
0:25:12,2 --> 0:25:13,7
engagement with the community.


541
0:25:13,7 --> 0:25:17,0
And it is, it is a terrific
center and the kids were really


542
0:25:17,0 --> 0:25:19,7
our tour directors you
know all throughout,


543
0:25:19,7 --> 0:25:21,4
who were terrific spokes people.


544
0:25:21,4 --> 0:25:25,467
And real examples of what
mentorship and what you all do


545
0:25:25,467 --> 0:25:27,3
with Big Brothers
and Big Sisters.


546
0:25:27,3 --> 0:25:31,133
The kinds of molding of
young lives that you,


547
0:25:31,133 --> 0:25:32,767
you all do everyday.


548
0:25:32,767 --> 0:25:35,433
So my message is I guess
you know just really very


549
0:25:35,433 --> 0:25:36,9
brief and two fold.


550
0:25:36,9 --> 0:25:40,934
And that is to thank you for
the work that I know all of


551
0:25:40,934 --> 0:25:46,133
you do across the country
everyday with your mentors,


552
0:25:46,133 --> 0:25:49,3
supporting them and recruiting
them with your mentees.


553
0:25:49,3 --> 0:25:51,967
Supporting them in their lives.


554
0:25:51,967 --> 0:25:56,433
And to make sure that you know
that you have great supporters


555
0:25:56,433 --> 0:25:59,133
and partners in both the East
Wing and the West Wing of


556
0:25:59,133 --> 0:26:0,333
the White House.


557
0:26:0,333 --> 0:26:3,5
And really people throughout
the administration who know


558
0:26:3,5 --> 0:26:7,33
what important work
it is that you do,


559
0:26:7,33 --> 0:26:10,4
who are great supporters
of the work that you do.


560
0:26:10,4 --> 0:26:13,934
And that, you know, we look
forward to continuing to expand


561
0:26:13,934 --> 0:26:17,133
that work and to figure out
ways on which we can you know,


562
0:26:17,133 --> 0:26:19,834
send along and continue
to promote the message of


563
0:26:19,834 --> 0:26:23,2
mentorship throughout
everything that we do.


564
0:26:23,2 --> 0:26:24,8
So thank you again.


565
0:26:24,8 --> 0:26:28,33
With that, I am, you know, I can
take a couple of questions if


566
0:26:28,33 --> 0:26:29,4
people have got some.


567
0:26:29,4 --> 0:26:29,734
Yes.


568
0:26:29,734 --> 0:26:31,6
Paul Bliss:
Yes, I am Paul bliss,


569
0:26:31,6 --> 0:26:35,133
CEO of Big Brothers Big
Sisters in Washington, D.C.


570
0:26:35,133 --> 0:26:38,7
and we have had the
privilege of hosting the Obama


571
0:26:38,7 --> 0:26:42,667
family for approximately two
hours painting the school


572
0:26:42,667 --> 0:26:44,266
for Martin Luther King Day.


573
0:26:44,266 --> 0:26:47,133
And I know there is an
awful lot of Big Brother,


574
0:26:47,133 --> 0:26:50,767
Big Sister agencies across
the country that would love to


575
0:26:50,767 --> 0:26:55,834
be able to host the
President or the First Lady.


576
0:26:55,834 --> 0:26:57,567
How would they go
about doing that?


577
0:26:57,567 --> 0:27:1,467
Obviously, there is re-elections
and there is traveling


578
0:27:1,467 --> 0:27:3,667
throughout the country.


579
0:27:3,667 --> 0:27:6,8
I am certain that there
would be opportunities for us


580
0:27:6,8 --> 0:27:10,867
to host the First Family.


581
0:27:10,867 --> 0:27:14,66
Tina Tchen:
Well, and we have had a 
wonderful time here in,


582
0:27:14,66 --> 0:27:16,133
in the DC community.


583
0:27:16,133 --> 0:27:17,33
Sure.


584
0:27:17,33 --> 0:27:19,233
It is -- travel is always
a little challenging.


585
0:27:19,233 --> 0:27:21,567
It is going to be particularly
challenging this year with the


586
0:27:21,567 --> 0:27:26,6
remaining 149 days I gather that
there are now between now and


587
0:27:26,6 --> 0:27:32,5
Novemeber 6 just to pick
a day off the calendar.


588
0:27:32,5 --> 0:27:35,934
But, you know, we are certainly
you know in -- and Kareem you


589
0:27:35,934 --> 0:27:39,633
know can be your contact at
public engagement if there are


590
0:27:39,633 --> 0:27:40,9
particular invites
that you all have or


591
0:27:40,9 --> 0:27:44,233
particular ideas for things.


592
0:27:44,233 --> 0:27:47,233
Feel free to send them in and
send them along you know through


593
0:27:47,233 --> 0:27:50,6
Kareem and his team and they
will get them over to us to,


594
0:27:50,6 --> 0:27:51,533
to consider.


595
0:27:51,533 --> 0:27:54,5
You know, we are happy,
happy to consider those.


596
0:27:54,5 --> 0:27:59,734
But I will beg your indulgence
and your patience as we


597
0:27:59,734 --> 0:28:3,4
work our ways through what
are, what are lots of requests.


598
0:28:3,4 --> 0:28:6,667
But as I said, these are, these
are important issues to the


599
0:28:6,667 --> 0:28:11,233
President and First Lady,
so we welcome any ideas.


600
0:28:11,233 --> 0:28:11,867
Speaker:
Hi Tina.


601
0:28:11,867 --> 0:28:12,934
Remember me.


602
0:28:12,934 --> 0:28:13,834
Tina Tchen:
I do.


603
0:28:13,834 --> 0:28:15,5
Speaker:
How are you?


604
0:28:15,5 --> 0:28:16,567
Tina Tchen:
Okay. How are you?


605
0:28:16,567 --> 0:28:18,633
Speaker:
We spent many years
together in Chicago at the


606
0:28:18,633 --> 0:28:20,934
Department of Children and
Family Services and we won't


607
0:28:20,934 --> 0:28:22,66
talk about that anymore.


608
0:28:22,66 --> 0:28:23,667
(laughter)


609
0:28:23,667 --> 0:28:26,66
It is one, it is just
great to see you.


610
0:28:26,66 --> 0:28:30,7
And the second thing is
connecting with your office and


611
0:28:30,7 --> 0:28:34,533
helping Big Brothers, Big
Sisters expose more of the


612
0:28:34,533 --> 0:28:35,767
work that it is doing.


613
0:28:35,767 --> 0:28:38,533
Particularly, I was very
interested in what Kareem


614
0:28:38,533 --> 0:28:44,333
talked about, highlighting
some of the matches,


615
0:28:44,333 --> 0:28:46,2
the longevity of those matches.


616
0:28:46,2 --> 0:28:50,4
We just had a match that lasted
four children had 24 years of


617
0:28:50,4 --> 0:28:52,33
mentoring from us.


618
0:28:52,33 --> 0:28:53,567
All four went to college.


619
0:28:53,567 --> 0:28:57,2
Two have graduated and two are
on their way to graduating.


620
0:28:57,2 --> 0:28:59,667
That is the kind of community
story I would like to see on


621
0:28:59,667 --> 0:29:2,567
the website or some way
that we can do that.


622
0:29:2,567 --> 0:29:4,6
So if you don't
mind, may I call you?


623
0:29:4,6 --> 0:29:6,433
Tina Tchen:
Of course, you can do that.


624
0:29:6,433 --> 0:29:10,567
And Kareem really is, you
know, we rely on him


625
0:29:10,567 --> 0:29:11,934
also as a contact.


626
0:29:11,934 --> 0:29:16,33
But, you know, he can
get you through to me.


627
0:29:16,33 --> 0:29:20,1
And, and I think, you know,
trying to really pass that word


628
0:29:20,1 --> 0:29:22,367
along and highlight stories.


629
0:29:22,367 --> 0:29:24,667
We are always looking
for, you know,


630
0:29:24,667 --> 0:29:27,1
we call them real
person stories.


631
0:29:27,1 --> 0:29:30,433
But those, those things
that really convey.


632
0:29:30,433 --> 0:29:33,233
You know, we have found telling
an individual's story is


633
0:29:33,233 --> 0:29:35,266
sometimes you know, the
most powerful thing.


634
0:29:35,266 --> 0:29:37,233
You know, I should mention
one of the things I wanted in


635
0:29:37,233 --> 0:29:40,133
particular to mention from the
First Lady's office that we have


636
0:29:40,133 --> 0:29:43,467
spent the last year working on
and I know I think many of


637
0:29:43,467 --> 0:29:46,4
your chapters have as
well, and that is our


638
0:29:46,4 --> 0:29:47,867
Joining Forces Initiative.


639
0:29:47,867 --> 0:29:51,233
So a year ago April the First
Lady started the second


640
0:29:51,233 --> 0:29:52,66
of her initiatives.


641
0:29:52,66 --> 0:29:54,734
The first one is our Let's Move
Initiative on childhood obesity.


642
0:29:54,734 --> 0:29:58,333
But the second one is Joining
Forces which really works to


643
0:29:58,333 --> 0:30:1,6
address the issues concerning
our military families,


644
0:30:1,6 --> 0:30:7,5
our veterans, our active duty
reserve, our military families.


645
0:30:7,5 --> 0:30:10,934
And in particular not just
the service member themselves,


646
0:30:10,934 --> 0:30:13,66
but also their spouse
and their children.


647
0:30:13,66 --> 0:30:16,233
And this is something the First
Lady you know really learned


648
0:30:16,233 --> 0:30:19,934
about on the campaign trail in
talking to many of these


649
0:30:19,934 --> 0:30:23,567
spouses and realizing the
tremendous challenges that


650
0:30:23,567 --> 0:30:25,3
these families have.


651
0:30:25,3 --> 0:30:27,967
They have you know after
ten years of war with an all


652
0:30:27,967 --> 0:30:31,3
volunteer force, we really have
one percent of the country that


653
0:30:31,3 --> 0:30:34,66
is serving to protect
the 99 percent of us.


654
0:30:34,66 --> 0:30:36,33
And I count myself
in that 99 percent,


655
0:30:36,33 --> 0:30:38,66
not coming from a
military family.


656
0:30:38,66 --> 0:30:39,633
But I have now had
the privilege of meeting


657
0:30:39,633 --> 0:30:41,66
these incredible families.


658
0:30:41,66 --> 0:30:43,567
These are folks
whose kids, you know,


659
0:30:43,567 --> 0:30:46,7
probably went to ten schools
before they graduated high


660
0:30:46,7 --> 0:30:48,533
school, because
their parent is deployed and


661
0:30:48,533 --> 0:30:50,166
moved so many times.


662
0:30:50,166 --> 0:30:54,633
They are families who have
endured having their military


663
0:30:54,633 --> 0:30:58,33
family members sometimes it is
actually both parents, you know,


664
0:30:58,33 --> 0:30:59,367
serve multiple deployments.


665
0:30:59,367 --> 0:31:1,333
You know, not just you once.


666
0:31:1,333 --> 0:31:4,633
Usually two, three,
four, five, six times deployed


667
0:31:4,633 --> 0:31:6,33
into a war zone.


668
0:31:6,33 --> 0:31:11,767
And these are kids who are
incredibly resilient and like


669
0:31:11,767 --> 0:31:16,6
their families are pretty
stoic and incredibly patriotic.


670
0:31:16,6 --> 0:31:20,1
But kids who really
deserve our help.


671
0:31:20,1 --> 0:31:24,6
And you know, I know, you know
mentoring and providing you know


672
0:31:24,6 --> 0:31:27,734
that kind of guidance that you
all do so well for our military


673
0:31:27,734 --> 0:31:30,734
kids, would be, you
know, a terrific service.


674
0:31:30,734 --> 0:31:33,4
And it is not just the kids who
are near a military base because


675
0:31:33,4 --> 0:31:36,834
in many ways those communities
are pretty visible and


676
0:31:36,834 --> 0:31:38,66
have stepped up.


677
0:31:38,66 --> 0:31:40,0
Our reserves in
Illinois, you know,


678
0:31:40,0 --> 0:31:43,934
we really have Illinois guard
units that have deployed.


679
0:31:43,934 --> 0:31:46,767
And then those, those, those
folks are spread out to our


680
0:31:46,767 --> 0:31:47,233
communities.


681
0:31:47,233 --> 0:31:48,2
They are not near a base.


682
0:31:48,2 --> 0:31:51,8
So you may have a kid you know
who is the only kid in their


683
0:31:51,8 --> 0:31:54,9
school who is going
through a deployment.


684
0:31:54,9 --> 0:31:58,2
And finding those kids and
finding ways to connect and


685
0:31:58,2 --> 0:32:1,266
support those kids
is something that we,


686
0:32:1,266 --> 0:32:3,166
is I think a really
important service.


687
0:32:3,166 --> 0:32:9,934
And something that you all
can uniquely provide to them.


688
0:32:9,934 --> 0:32:11,433
Okay.


689
0:32:11,433 --> 0:32:12,7
One more.


690
0:32:12,7 --> 0:32:13,333
No.


691
0:32:13,333 --> 0:32:13,9
No more.


692
0:32:13,9 --> 0:32:14,9
I think we answered it all.


693
0:32:14,9 --> 0:32:16,9
Well, thank you again for
all of the work that you do.


694
0:32:16,9 --> 0:32:18,266
Oh, wait one more.


695
0:32:18,266 --> 0:32:19,767
Speaker:
Can you comment on how
you think Big Brothers,


696
0:32:19,767 --> 0:32:24,3
Big Sisters could be relevant
in helping the Council


697
0:32:24,3 --> 0:32:25,7
On Women And Girls?


698
0:32:25,7 --> 0:32:27,266
Tina Tchen:
Well, absolutely.


699
0:32:27,266 --> 0:32:30,5
You know, we would, you know,
again I think that what you do,


700
0:32:30,5 --> 0:32:33,767
you know mentorship and
providing role models for young


701
0:32:33,767 --> 0:32:36,166
girls is, is very important.


702
0:32:36,166 --> 0:32:39,4
And one area that we have been
able to spend a lot of time on


703
0:32:39,4 --> 0:32:42,1
here, at the White House and
through the council has been in


704
0:32:42,1 --> 0:32:43,233
the area of STEM education.


705
0:32:43,233 --> 0:32:45,9
In fact, I just came from a,
from a bilateral session this


706
0:32:45,9 --> 0:32:49,133
morning with a delegation from
India where we were trying to


707
0:32:49,133 --> 0:32:52,166
find ways to support women
and girls in the science,


708
0:32:52,166 --> 0:32:54,433
technology, engineering,
and math fields.


709
0:32:54,433 --> 0:32:56,467
But we have tried to do
that across the board.


710
0:32:56,467 --> 0:33:0,266
We know that we lose
starting after the 4th grade,


711
0:33:0,266 --> 0:33:3,567
girls where they are, girls and
boys interest are about the same


712
0:33:3,567 --> 0:33:6,0
in math and science, that
it starts to fall off pretty


713
0:33:6,0 --> 0:33:8,567
precipitously, you
know, past that point.


714
0:33:8,567 --> 0:33:10,533
And these are the
jobs of the future.


715
0:33:10,533 --> 0:33:12,633
Even though women are
half of the work force,


716
0:33:12,633 --> 0:33:15,967
they are only 25 percent of
the careers in the STEM fields.


717
0:33:15,967 --> 0:33:20,533
And we are not only losing our
girls and our girls are losing


718
0:33:20,533 --> 0:33:23,734
the ability to
access those careers,


719
0:33:23,734 --> 0:33:26,934
which are both where the jobs
are going to be and the economy


720
0:33:26,934 --> 0:33:29,266
of the future and where
the higher paying jobs


721
0:33:29,266 --> 0:33:30,367
are going to be.


722
0:33:30,367 --> 0:33:33,133
We as a country are
losing out on that talent.


723
0:33:33,133 --> 0:33:36,567
And so getting, you know, doing,
providing mentorship at a young


724
0:33:36,567 --> 0:33:40,4
age for these young girls
is going to be pretty key.


725
0:33:40,4 --> 0:33:44,467
So recruiting, we have tried to
actually tap into our federal


726
0:33:44,467 --> 0:33:47,767
scientists in our work force
to provide that mentorship


727
0:33:47,767 --> 0:33:48,533
opportunity.


728
0:33:48,533 --> 0:33:51,4
I think Big Brothers and Big
Sisters could do that as well.


729
0:33:51,4 --> 0:33:53,3
But that is not just
in the STEM area.


730
0:33:53,3 --> 0:33:56,0
We have the next area we
would like to do more in,


731
0:33:56,0 --> 0:33:59,567
I will you know, be quite candid
to say we haven't spend enough


732
0:33:59,567 --> 0:34:2,867
time on but would like to do
some more on is the more general


733
0:34:2,867 --> 0:34:6,667
area of girl's self esteem.


734
0:34:6,667 --> 0:34:11,266
I mean I think building the self
esteem of our young girls and


735
0:34:11,266 --> 0:34:14,133
women and I say this as the
mom of a 15 year old daughter,


736
0:34:14,133 --> 0:34:16,8
is so important with all
of the other counter messaging


737
0:34:16,8 --> 0:34:19,433
that they are exposed to
that is out there.


738
0:34:19,433 --> 0:34:24,467
Again, I think mentors
provide that sounding board,


739
0:34:24,467 --> 0:34:29,867
an alternative role model, an
alternative ear and support to


740
0:34:29,867 --> 0:34:33,266
these young girls who are
fighting against a lot of


741
0:34:33,266 --> 0:34:35,2
cultural messaging
that is different.


742
0:34:35,2 --> 0:34:38,7
And in many cases, you
know, even worse kinds of


743
0:34:38,7 --> 0:34:41,834
vulnerabilities and dangers,
whether it is dangers at home,


744
0:34:41,834 --> 0:34:44,533
and vulnerabilities at
home, or externally.


745
0:34:44,533 --> 0:34:48,467
And I think making sure
that we are connected to


746
0:34:48,467 --> 0:34:49,6
those young girls.


747
0:34:49,6 --> 0:34:53,0
And we would welcome you
know greater partnership.


748
0:34:53,0 --> 0:34:56,333
We have a Deputy Director Avra
Siegel who works with me and


749
0:34:56,333 --> 0:34:57,433
Haley Schneier (phonetic)


750
0:34:57,433 --> 0:34:59,2
who is one of Kareem's
colleagues in the Office of


751
0:34:59,2 --> 0:35:3,0
Public Engagement who is devoted
to women and girls outreach.


752
0:35:3,0 --> 0:35:5,734
And again Kareem can get you
in touch you know with a more


753
0:35:5,734 --> 0:35:8,266
specifically if there is
specific things that you want


754
0:35:8,266 --> 0:35:10,133
to connect with the Council
on Women and Girls on.


755
0:35:10,133 --> 0:35:12,0
We would again
welcome that as well.


756
0:35:12,0 --> 0:35:13,233
So again, thank you.


757
0:35:13,233 --> 0:35:15,867
We hope you enjoyed your day at
the White House and we thank you


758
0:35:15,867 --> 0:35:18,66
again for all of the work
that you do everyday.


759
0:35:18,66 --> 0:35:29,6
(applause)


760
0:35:29,6 --> 0:35:30,1
Kareem Dale:
All right.


761
0:35:30,1 --> 0:35:32,4
Thank you very much, Tina.


762
0:35:32,4 --> 0:35:35,467
It is always, you
know, there is,


763
0:35:35,467 --> 0:35:37,4
there is a few of us around
here that have been around


764
0:35:37,4 --> 0:35:39,3
here since day one.


765
0:35:39,3 --> 0:35:40,6
And go back to the transition.


766
0:35:40,6 --> 0:35:45,533
Tina is one of those, one of my
colleagues here who we came in


767
0:35:45,533 --> 0:35:49,66
on day one, when it was
a little -- you know,


768
0:35:49,66 --> 0:35:51,7
we didn't quite know where all
of the bathrooms were and where


769
0:35:51,7 --> 0:35:53,1
everything was going on.


770
0:35:53,1 --> 0:35:58,834
So we spent a long time here
and it has been a great journey.


771
0:35:58,834 --> 0:36:1,133
So while we wait
for Joshua, a couple of


772
0:36:1,133 --> 0:36:4,2
other things I want to do.


773
0:36:4,2 --> 0:36:7,934
The first thing is when we, you
know, we talk about, you hear,


774
0:36:7,934 --> 0:36:10,533
you have heard Tina and you
heard Mike say it, if you,


775
0:36:10,533 --> 0:36:13,1
questions you have about
participating in events or


776
0:36:13,1 --> 0:36:16,2
getting in contact with Tina or
the Council for Women and Girls,


777
0:36:16,2 --> 0:36:18,2
we actually, we are
very serious about that.


778
0:36:18,2 --> 0:36:21,4
So if you do want to
make those connections,


779
0:36:21,4 --> 0:36:23,66
I am happy to help
make those connections.


780
0:36:23,66 --> 0:36:24,367
Particularly
because it won't go,


781
0:36:24,367 --> 0:36:25,967
it won't be me having
to do the work.


782
0:36:25,967 --> 0:36:27,633
I will be able to put
it off on my colleagues.


783
0:36:27,633 --> 0:36:30,8
I am always happy to give
my colleagues more work.


784
0:36:30,8 --> 0:36:34,4
And so but if you, if
you make that contact,


785
0:36:34,4 --> 0:36:38,567
Kelly your government relations
person has my email address


786
0:36:38,567 --> 0:36:39,567
and contact information.


787
0:36:39,567 --> 0:36:41,834
Kelly, you are free to give it
to any of these folks and


788
0:36:41,834 --> 0:36:44,33
we will make those
connections with you.


789
0:36:44,33 --> 0:36:48,266
And that reminds me, I want to
thank Kelly for all of her work


790
0:36:48,266 --> 0:36:50,5
in getting this done.


791
0:36:50,5 --> 0:36:52,333
She did a phenomenal job, and --


792
0:36:52,333 --> 0:36:56,5
(applause)


793
0:36:56,5 --> 0:36:59,734
-- believe you me, doing
something here at the White


794
0:36:59,734 --> 0:37:3,834
House like this, we put a lot of
demands on her to get us all of


795
0:37:3,834 --> 0:37:7,266
the information, get it right,
get it by a specific time,


796
0:37:7,266 --> 0:37:8,633
and this, that, and the other.


797
0:37:8,633 --> 0:37:9,633
So she did a great job.


798
0:37:9,633 --> 0:37:12,6
So we appreciate all of her
efforts in making the


799
0:37:12,6 --> 0:37:16,433
event easy for us.


800
0:37:16,433 --> 0:37:18,567
Is Joshua here?


801
0:37:18,567 --> 0:37:21,567
He usually just like yells
out at me or something crazy.


802
0:37:21,567 --> 0:37:26,7
So, so just if you have, if
you really do want to connect,


803
0:37:26,7 --> 0:37:30,433
you know, I will second what
Tina said about the young man


804
0:37:30,433 --> 0:37:32,767
who asked about the events, I
mean the schedule is incredibly


805
0:37:32,767 --> 0:37:34,667
tight for the President
and the First Lady.


806
0:37:34,667 --> 0:37:35,667
So it is very difficult.


807
0:37:35,667 --> 0:37:38,834
And a lot of times it is maybe
we get an opportunity for some


808
0:37:38,834 --> 0:37:41,6
sort of off the record
thing at the last minute.


809
0:37:41,6 --> 0:37:44,9
But it is incredibly difficult
to get things on the schedule.


810
0:37:44,9 --> 0:37:47,834
So just bear with us
and keep that in mind.


811
0:37:47,834 --> 0:37:51,233
But the First Lady's office is
really great about connecting


812
0:37:51,233 --> 0:37:53,967
particularly about
her core initiatives,


813
0:37:53,967 --> 0:37:59,266
whether it be Joining Forces, or
Childhood Obesity, Let's Move,


814
0:37:59,266 --> 0:38:1,633
those are her two
core initiatives.


815
0:38:1,633 --> 0:38:4,934
The Council on Women and Girls
would go through the two young


816
0:38:4,934 --> 0:38:6,5
ladies that Tina mentioned.


817
0:38:6,5 --> 0:38:9,1
So I am happy to make those
connections and our team is


818
0:38:9,1 --> 0:38:11,5
always looking for really
great opportunities.


819
0:38:11,5 --> 0:38:12,767
So I have more to say to you.


820
0:38:12,767 --> 0:38:15,33
But I don't want
Joshua yelling at me.


821
0:38:15,33 --> 0:38:19,2
So without further adieu, let me
introduce you to the head of our


822
0:38:19,2 --> 0:38:22,166
faith based office and another
one of my colleagues that has


823
0:38:22,166 --> 0:38:23,7
been here since day one.


824
0:38:23,7 --> 0:38:26,967
And is a long time friend and
worked for the President's


825
0:38:26,967 --> 0:38:28,5
Senate office as well.


826
0:38:28,5 --> 0:38:30,166
Joshua DuBois.


827
0:38:30,166 --> 0:38:32,0
(applause)


828
0:38:32,0 --> 0:38:32,867
Joshua DuBois:
Thank you.


829
0:38:32,867 --> 0:38:35,133
I appreciate it.


830
0:38:35,133 --> 0:38:36,633
Good afternoon everyone.


831
0:38:36,633 --> 0:38:37,533
Audience:
Good afternoon.


832
0:38:37,533 --> 0:38:38,967
Joshua DuBois:
It is such a pleasure to
be here and to bring


833
0:38:38,967 --> 0:38:41,33
you greetings on behalf
the President and the


834
0:38:41,33 --> 0:38:42,2
entire White House.


835
0:38:42,2 --> 0:38:46,734
And also on behalf of a
fellow Big Brother myself.


836
0:38:46,734 --> 0:38:50,7
(applause)


837
0:38:50,7 --> 0:38:51,7
This is my crowd here.


838
0:38:51,7 --> 0:38:55,66
I, I was, when I was walking
over here and I was recalling


839
0:38:55,66 --> 0:38:59,967
the first moment that I met my
little, I was at the top floor.


840
0:38:59,967 --> 0:39:2,8
Anybody been to Big Brothers
of Mass Bay by any chance?


841
0:39:2,8 --> 0:39:3,8
There we go.


842
0:39:3,8 --> 0:39:5,533
Hi, guys.


843
0:39:5,533 --> 0:39:7,333
So any way, and it is
in a high-rise building.


844
0:39:7,333 --> 0:39:9,767
At least it was at the time.


845
0:39:9,767 --> 0:39:11,934
We were in this conference
room on the top floor.


846
0:39:11,934 --> 0:39:15,5
And the dread and fear that
filled my soul when I thought


847
0:39:15,5 --> 0:39:19,734
about the, this responsibility
that I was entering into.


848
0:39:19,734 --> 0:39:22,934
And then I saw this little kid
with these huge eyes looking up


849
0:39:22,934 --> 0:39:25,934
at me, and I had no idea
what I was going to do.


850
0:39:25,934 --> 0:39:27,433
But I knew it was going
to be a good thing.


851
0:39:27,433 --> 0:39:30,533
And that was, gosh,
13 or 14 years ago.


852
0:39:30,533 --> 0:39:32,0
We have been hanging
out ever since.


853
0:39:32,0 --> 0:39:33,2
(applause)


854
0:39:33,2 --> 0:39:36,6
Thank you.


855
0:39:36,6 --> 0:39:40,633
I, I knew it was much more
than you know just kind of a


856
0:39:40,633 --> 0:39:43,934
programmatic connection when he
went on his Facebook page and,


857
0:39:43,934 --> 0:39:45,934
you know, you add your
siblings on there.


858
0:39:45,934 --> 0:39:49,834
And he added me as a brother
onto his, to his Facebook page.


859
0:39:49,834 --> 0:39:53,266
And I almost got emotional
when I saw that, that happen.


860
0:39:53,266 --> 0:39:57,633
So Adid, he is now, he
was a wonderful kid then,


861
0:39:57,633 --> 0:39:59,33
facing a number of
challenges in his life.


862
0:39:59,33 --> 0:39:59,967
His father was incarcerated.


863
0:39:59,967 --> 0:40:1,8
But I am happy to say he just
find up his freshman year


864
0:40:1,8 --> 0:40:2,8
at Morehouse College.


865
0:40:2,8 --> 0:40:6,7
And so we are delighted
by his progress.


866
0:40:6,7 --> 0:40:7,4
(applause)


867
0:40:7,4 --> 0:40:10,4
And it's just a wonderful
example of what you all do


868
0:40:10,4 --> 0:40:12,266
every single day.


869
0:40:12,266 --> 0:40:14,4
And it's the small
things that matter.


870
0:40:14,4 --> 0:40:16,767
It's the Match Support folks
reaching out to us and making


871
0:40:16,767 --> 0:40:19,567
sure things are on track,
even when we ignore them,


872
0:40:19,567 --> 0:40:20,734
and I'm sorry, guys.


873
0:40:20,734 --> 0:40:23,0
(laughter)


874
0:40:23,0 --> 0:40:24,5
I was quite delinquent.


875
0:40:24,5 --> 0:40:26,5
But I was still, Adid and
I were still connecting.


876
0:40:26,5 --> 0:40:29,567
But it took me a couple
weeks to return phone calls.


877
0:40:29,567 --> 0:40:32,233
But -- or, you know, the
opportunities that we went to


878
0:40:32,233 --> 0:40:36,133
baseball games at Fenway and ice
skating and all sorts of things.


879
0:40:36,133 --> 0:40:40,7
You know, years later these
stick with us and they matter.


880
0:40:40,7 --> 0:40:42,934
And, you know,
Adid, I'm positive,


881
0:40:42,934 --> 0:40:45,2
is going to be a future
leader in this country.


882
0:40:45,2 --> 0:40:48,567
He is going to finish up at
Morehouse and maybe run for


883
0:40:48,567 --> 0:40:50,6
office or impact
kids in other ways.


884
0:40:50,6 --> 0:40:54,233
And I was excited to talk to him
a couple weeks ago and he said


885
0:40:54,233 --> 0:40:56,734
he's going to reach out to
his own local Big Brothers,


886
0:40:56,734 --> 0:40:59,233
and when the time is right
become a Big Brother himself.


887
0:40:59,233 --> 0:41:1,834
And so you know that
your work matters,


888
0:41:1,834 --> 0:41:4,433
but on behalf of the President
I want to affirm that it matters


889
0:41:4,433 --> 0:41:7,7
so much for so many young
men and women all around,


890
0:41:7,7 --> 0:41:9,333
all across our country.


891
0:41:9,333 --> 0:41:11,2
So I lead the Office of
Faith-Based and Neighborhood


892
0:41:11,2 --> 0:41:15,767
Partnerships, and my job is to
work through our offices at 13


893
0:41:15,767 --> 0:41:18,834
federal agencies to connect
the Administration to local


894
0:41:18,834 --> 0:41:21,767
nonprofits, both
faith-based and secular.


895
0:41:21,767 --> 0:41:24,1
For example, we have an office
at the Department of Labor that


896
0:41:24,1 --> 0:41:27,333
works with local congregations
and nonprofits on job training


897
0:41:27,333 --> 0:41:28,967
programs, getting them
set up and running.


898
0:41:28,967 --> 0:41:32,567
We have an office at the
Department of Agriculture that


899
0:41:32,567 --> 0:41:35,633
works on food and nutrition
issues with local congregations


900
0:41:35,633 --> 0:41:37,934
and nonprofits at the Department
of Justice and Education,


901
0:41:37,934 --> 0:41:39,33
and on, and on.


902
0:41:39,33 --> 0:41:41,4
We've managed the government's
relationship with local groups


903
0:41:41,4 --> 0:41:42,433
around the country.


904
0:41:42,433 --> 0:41:45,9
And we're also one of several
advocates for mentoring


905
0:41:45,9 --> 0:41:47,767
in the Administration.


906
0:41:47,767 --> 0:41:50,867
I have been particularly pleased
to work with my colleagues at


907
0:41:50,867 --> 0:41:53,5
the Department of Justice on
making sure that the funding


908
0:41:53,5 --> 0:41:56,734
for mentoring programs like
Big Brothers continues and


909
0:41:56,734 --> 0:41:58,66
strengthens in some ways.


910
0:41:58,66 --> 0:42:0,867
I was very delighted last
year we were able to support,


911
0:42:0,867 --> 0:42:8,0
in somewhat of a new way,
mentoring of juvenile offenders


912
0:42:8,0 --> 0:42:11,367
to the tune of about $13
million in an impactful way.


913
0:42:11,367 --> 0:42:12,834
Thank you.


914
0:42:12,834 --> 0:42:13,266
(applause)


915
0:42:13,266 --> 0:42:17,4
And what we're trying to do is
kind of weave mentoring into


916
0:42:17,4 --> 0:42:19,4
federal programs that may
be distinct from mentoring.


917
0:42:19,4 --> 0:42:21,867
For example, workforce
development, you know, well,


918
0:42:21,867 --> 0:42:23,633
if you're thinking
about, you know,


919
0:42:23,633 --> 0:42:27,367
how to make sure that young
people are connected to jobs,


920
0:42:27,367 --> 0:42:29,433
well, one thing they need is a
good mentor in their life that


921
0:42:29,433 --> 0:42:33,567
reminds them about, you know,
the importance of going to


922
0:42:33,567 --> 0:42:35,734
work and finding employment.


923
0:42:35,734 --> 0:42:39,7
If you're looking at ex-offender
reentry, which we talked about,


924
0:42:39,7 --> 0:42:42,967
or substance abuse, well, one
thing that would be great for


925
0:42:42,967 --> 0:42:44,967
folks who are receiving
counseling and support for


926
0:42:44,967 --> 0:42:47,6
substance problems is to have a
mentor that comes alongside them


927
0:42:47,6 --> 0:42:48,6
and supports them as well.


928
0:42:48,6 --> 0:42:50,867
So we're trying to
cross-pollinate mentoring


929
0:42:50,867 --> 0:42:54,3
across other federal programs
and federal agencies,


930
0:42:54,3 --> 0:42:57,967
and our office does a lot
of that work advocating for


931
0:42:57,967 --> 0:42:59,834
mentoring across
the Administration.


932
0:42:59,834 --> 0:43:1,5
We are open to new ideas.


933
0:43:1,5 --> 0:43:3,533
For example, we've been
participating in some


934
0:43:3,533 --> 0:43:7,767
conversations recently about
how in light of the cuts to


935
0:43:7,767 --> 0:43:9,166
the Mentoring Children
of Prisoners program,


936
0:43:9,166 --> 0:43:11,567
how potentially the Department
of Justice can partner with


937
0:43:11,567 --> 0:43:13,8
HHS to support some
of that good work.


938
0:43:13,8 --> 0:43:16,567
If there are other ideas, in
fact I was talking with one of


939
0:43:16,567 --> 0:43:19,8
our other mentoring leads
at DOJ on the way over here,


940
0:43:19,8 --> 0:43:21,2
we want to hear from you.


941
0:43:21,2 --> 0:43:24,0
We don't want this to be
a one-way conversation.


942
0:43:24,0 --> 0:43:25,834
There's a lot going on
at any given moment.


943
0:43:25,834 --> 0:43:28,367
I have 13 agency
offices I'm running,


944
0:43:28,367 --> 0:43:29,734
and other folks are
doing a lot of work,


945
0:43:29,734 --> 0:43:34,533
and so don't assume that we have
all the ideas and info we need


946
0:43:34,533 --> 0:43:35,433
to support mentoring.


947
0:43:35,433 --> 0:43:37,1
We don't, we need your feedback.


948
0:43:37,1 --> 0:43:40,66
We need to be in conversation
and dialogue with you.


949
0:43:40,66 --> 0:43:41,934
I'll give everyone my e-mail
address so we can keep the


950
0:43:41,934 --> 0:43:44,266
conversation going from here.


951
0:43:44,266 --> 0:43:46,867
For any tweeters in the room,
any folks on Twitter in here?


952
0:43:46,867 --> 0:43:49,367
I'm also @JoshuaDuBois as well.


953
0:43:49,367 --> 0:43:52,533
And I respond to
those frequently.


954
0:43:52,533 --> 0:44:7,133
My e-mail address is JDuBois,
J-D-U-B-O-I-S @WHO.EOP.gov.


955
0:44:7,133 --> 0:44:7,6
I'll give that again.


956
0:44:7,6 --> 0:44:13,233
J DuBois, JDUBOIS at WHO,
as in White House Office,


957
0:44:13,233 --> 0:44:17,0
EOP, Executive Office
of the President, .gov.


958
0:44:17,0 --> 0:44:19,2
And I'd love to continue the
conversation with you all.


959
0:44:19,2 --> 0:44:21,266
But, you know, most
importantly, thank you for


960
0:44:21,266 --> 0:44:22,266
all the good work you do.


961
0:44:22,266 --> 0:44:25,7
I am just one of thousands of
Big Brothers and Big Sisters


962
0:44:25,7 --> 0:44:29,6
who's deeply appreciative of
this wonderful organization.


963
0:44:29,6 --> 0:44:31,7
You're changing lives
every single day.


964
0:44:31,7 --> 0:44:33,233
People say that a
lot, but, you know,


965
0:44:33,233 --> 0:44:36,2
I've seen it in my own life
and in Adid's life as well,


966
0:44:36,2 --> 0:44:37,934
and on behalf of the
President I want to appreciate


967
0:44:37,934 --> 0:44:39,33
your good work.


968
0:44:39,33 --> 0:44:39,8
Thank you all so much.


969
0:44:39,8 --> 0:44:42,266
(applause)


970
0:44:42,266 --> 0:44:55,333
Thank you.


971
0:44:55,333 --> 0:44:57,767
Kareem Dale:
All right.


972
0:44:57,767 --> 0:44:58,934
Thank you very much to Joshua.


973
0:44:58,934 --> 0:45:3,1
So our next speaker, as
you see from your agenda,


974
0:45:3,1 --> 0:45:6,967
is from Department of Health and
Human Services Administration on


975
0:45:6,967 --> 0:45:8,633
Children and Families.


976
0:45:8,633 --> 0:45:11,233
Please give a warm
welcome to George Sheldon.


977
0:45:11,233 --> 0:45:17,767
(applause)


978
0:45:17,767 --> 0:45:18,3
George Sheldon:
Thank you.


979
0:45:18,3 --> 0:45:19,734
Welcome.


980
0:45:19,734 --> 0:45:21,633
Do we have any Floridians here?


981
0:45:21,633 --> 0:45:22,433
(cheering)


982
0:45:22,433 --> 0:45:23,2
All right.


983
0:45:23,2 --> 0:45:24,633
I just want to make sure.


984
0:45:24,633 --> 0:45:26,7
I've only been with the
federal government for


985
0:45:26,7 --> 0:45:28,1
the last 12 months.


986
0:45:28,1 --> 0:45:31,6
I had this nice, quiet job in
Florida running the Florida


987
0:45:31,6 --> 0:45:33,533
Department of
Children and Families,


988
0:45:33,533 --> 0:45:37,433
and so they decided to open me
up to the federal government,


989
0:45:37,433 --> 0:45:41,7
and I'm really trying to
learn how this process works.


990
0:45:41,7 --> 0:45:44,967
My Deputy in Florida when
I came here said that


991
0:45:44,967 --> 0:45:49,667
Washington is 76 square
miles surrounded by reality.


992
0:45:49,667 --> 0:45:50,767
(laughter)


993
0:45:50,767 --> 0:45:55,0
But I -- and I think that Joshua
made this point -- is that all


994
0:45:55,0 --> 0:45:57,633
knowledge doesn't reside
here, it really is out in the


995
0:45:57,633 --> 0:46:0,66
communities, and I've
learned that so much.


996
0:46:0,66 --> 0:46:4,3
I would also say that there
have been better times to be the


997
0:46:4,3 --> 0:46:6,767
Assistant Secretary
of the Administration for


998
0:46:6,767 --> 0:46:8,166
Children and Families.


999
0:46:8,166 --> 0:46:11,5
I would love to have been
Assistant Secretary in the '90s,


1000
0:46:11,5 --> 0:46:14,333
when the federal government was
flush with dollars and we were


1001
0:46:14,333 --> 0:46:17,66
expanding, but these
are different times.


1002
0:46:17,66 --> 0:46:20,2
I mean, you know that.


1003
0:46:20,2 --> 0:46:23,3
You've seen the recent poverty
numbers among children,


1004
0:46:23,3 --> 0:46:28,4
one in every five children in
this country live in poverty.


1005
0:46:28,4 --> 0:46:31,734
It's even worse for African
Americans, about 38 percent,


1006
0:46:31,734 --> 0:46:34,367
35 percent for Hispanics.


1007
0:46:34,367 --> 0:46:38,233
It's upwards to almost 50
percent with children


1008
0:46:38,233 --> 0:46:41,8
who are growing up in
single-parent families.


1009
0:46:41,8 --> 0:46:47,934
And that's four times the
rate of poverty among kids in


1010
0:46:47,934 --> 0:46:49,333
two-parent families.


1011
0:46:49,333 --> 0:46:53,133
And so children are
much more at risk today than


1012
0:46:53,133 --> 0:46:54,433
probably ever before.


1013
0:46:54,433 --> 0:46:56,433
And a lot of things add to that.


1014
0:46:56,433 --> 0:47:1,8
I was in San Diego just
this last Thursday,


1015
0:47:1,8 --> 0:47:8,533
and met with the Federal Task
Force on Human Trafficking at


1016
0:47:8,533 --> 0:47:14,934
the high school, Glenmont
Unified School District,


1017
0:47:14,934 --> 0:47:23,1
and came, you know, stark in
the face of active recruiting in


1018
0:47:23,1 --> 0:47:27,533
that high school and other
high schools for children


1019
0:47:27,533 --> 0:47:29,5
to be trafficked.


1020
0:47:29,5 --> 0:47:34,867
It is a whole new phenomenon,
and these are children who are


1021
0:47:34,867 --> 0:47:40,2
disaffected, who may not have
the best of all home life.


1022
0:47:40,2 --> 0:47:43,967
And that's, and that combined
with everything is a real,


1023
0:47:43,967 --> 0:47:48,567
is the reason the partnerships
with entities like Big Brothers


1024
0:47:48,567 --> 0:47:50,3
and Big Sisters is so important.


1025
0:47:50,3 --> 0:47:53,367
And I'm not saying
that, that's a reality.


1026
0:47:53,367 --> 0:47:56,633
When I first got to the
Department in Florida,


1027
0:47:56,633 --> 0:48:1,367
I sat down with about 15 young
kids who aged out of foster


1028
0:48:1,367 --> 0:48:6,767
care, and these were kids in
their, you know, 20, 21, 25.


1029
0:48:6,767 --> 0:48:9,7
And, you know, it was one of
those kind of things you do when


1030
0:48:9,7 --> 0:48:11,9
you just become an agency
head and you think, well,


1031
0:48:11,9 --> 0:48:14,7
I've got to go by this, so
I'll spend about 20 minutes,


1032
0:48:14,7 --> 0:48:16,533
make a few comments.


1033
0:48:16,533 --> 0:48:19,2
Well, two and a
half hours later,


1034
0:48:19,2 --> 0:48:22,867
I think I learned more from
those 15 kids about foster care


1035
0:48:22,867 --> 0:48:24,333
than I ever learned from
all the professionals.


1036
0:48:24,333 --> 0:48:27,367
And I'm not taking anything
away from professionals.


1037
0:48:27,367 --> 0:48:30,6
But we designed really a whole
child welfare system in this


1038
0:48:30,6 --> 0:48:32,633
country, and we never
talked to the kids.


1039
0:48:32,633 --> 0:48:37,4
(applause)


1040
0:48:37,4 --> 0:48:38,867
And I think that's, I mean,
I think that's so -- what I


1041
0:48:38,867 --> 0:48:44,166
learned from those kids was
almost to a child they said I


1042
0:48:44,166 --> 0:48:47,6
would have rather stayed at
home and dealt with some of the


1043
0:48:47,6 --> 0:48:51,667
issues out of my home than to
go in to a child welfare system


1044
0:48:51,667 --> 0:48:55,33
where I was passed from home
to home, school to school.


1045
0:48:55,33 --> 0:49:3,367
And I don't care if you're
in ten good foster homes,


1046
0:49:3,367 --> 0:49:5,2
that if you're in
that many homes,


1047
0:49:5,2 --> 0:49:9,66
you begin to believe as a child
you don't belong anywhere.


1048
0:49:9,66 --> 0:49:13,233
And that is so important, that
is the reason that mentors are


1049
0:49:13,233 --> 0:49:14,967
so important.


1050
0:49:14,967 --> 0:49:18,9
Whether a brother figure or
sister figure or father figure


1051
0:49:18,9 --> 0:49:21,934
or mother figure is so
important to these kids,


1052
0:49:21,934 --> 0:49:24,667
whether it's children in
the child welfare system,


1053
0:49:24,667 --> 0:49:28,166
those children who are
susceptible to human trafficking


1054
0:49:28,166 --> 0:49:32,734
in Glenmont High School, it
is so important to


1055
0:49:32,734 --> 0:49:34,0
have that connection.


1056
0:49:34,0 --> 0:49:37,367
The other thing I learned from
those kids was how important one


1057
0:49:37,367 --> 0:49:38,667
human being was in their life.


1058
0:49:38,667 --> 0:49:43,233
It may have been
another foster child,


1059
0:49:43,233 --> 0:49:44,8
it may have been
a foster parent,


1060
0:49:44,8 --> 0:49:46,266
it may have been
their caseworker,


1061
0:49:46,266 --> 0:49:48,333
but in many cases
it was a mentor.


1062
0:49:48,333 --> 0:49:53,333
Somebody who took the time to
do something with them that they


1063
0:49:53,333 --> 0:49:54,567
looked for every week.


1064
0:49:54,567 --> 0:50:0,734
The third thing I really learned
is how important being normal is


1065
0:50:0,734 --> 0:50:3,967
to them and doing normal things.


1066
0:50:3,967 --> 0:50:6,567
And if you look at
child welfare systems,


1067
0:50:6,567 --> 0:50:8,834
they're really designed
to be risk adverse.


1068
0:50:8,834 --> 0:50:12,934
You know, let's not allow
something to happen because


1069
0:50:12,934 --> 0:50:16,1
we're going to be sued
as a result of it.


1070
0:50:16,1 --> 0:50:20,5
So we, you know, when I was --
I was speaking to a group of


1071
0:50:20,5 --> 0:50:23,133
foster parents in
Clearwater, actually,


1072
0:50:23,133 --> 0:50:27,233
and afterwards some of these
foster parents came over to me


1073
0:50:27,233 --> 0:50:32,6
and said that we had a dangerous
activity czar in the department.


1074
0:50:32,6 --> 0:50:34,3
I said no, we don't.


1075
0:50:34,3 --> 0:50:35,233
(laughter)


1076
0:50:35,233 --> 0:50:36,633
She said, yes, you do.


1077
0:50:36,633 --> 0:50:37,633
Well, we did.


1078
0:50:37,633 --> 0:50:40,934
We had the this woman who
approved what foster


1079
0:50:40,934 --> 0:50:43,133
children could do.


1080
0:50:43,133 --> 0:50:45,166
Well, you can be
part of Boy Scouts,


1081
0:50:45,166 --> 0:50:48,4
but you can't
participate in archery.


1082
0:50:48,4 --> 0:50:50,834
I mean, I'm serious about this.


1083
0:50:50,834 --> 0:50:54,5
And so I basically
said, you know,


1084
0:50:54,5 --> 0:50:55,834
you can do something
else in the department,


1085
0:50:55,834 --> 0:50:57,0
and we created what we call --


1086
0:50:57,0 --> 0:50:59,333
(laughter)


1087
0:50:59,333 --> 0:51:2,767
We created what I
called a normalcy czar.


1088
0:51:2,767 --> 0:51:5,66
Because that's what
kids want to be.


1089
0:51:5,66 --> 0:51:10,533
They want to go, they don't want
the latest Wii game or iPad,


1090
0:51:10,533 --> 0:51:14,0
most of them want to go
to the prom or they want


1091
0:51:14,0 --> 0:51:15,367
to learn how to drive.


1092
0:51:15,367 --> 0:51:17,834
Ninety percent of the kids in
the foster care system age out


1093
0:51:17,834 --> 0:51:19,367
without a driver's license.


1094
0:51:19,367 --> 0:51:23,266
My god daughter, when she was
old enough to get her learner's


1095
0:51:23,266 --> 0:51:27,867
permit, she had
dad up at 7:00 a.m.


1096
0:51:27,867 --> 0:51:29,767
You know what I'm talking about.


1097
0:51:29,767 --> 0:51:33,967
We also use all these nonnormal
words at child welfare.


1098
0:51:33,967 --> 0:51:39,0
You know, foster kids are
in multiple placements.


1099
0:51:39,0 --> 0:51:41,333
Regular kids grow up in
several different homes.


1100
0:51:41,333 --> 0:51:45,4
You know, foster parents
need respite care.


1101
0:51:45,4 --> 0:51:47,433
Regular parents need a vacation.


1102
0:51:47,433 --> 0:51:48,767
(laughter)


1103
0:51:48,767 --> 0:51:52,8
I mean, it's, and I think it's
a mindset we really kind of have


1104
0:51:52,8 --> 0:51:54,433
to get out to.


1105
0:51:54,433 --> 0:51:56,867
The -- but I do think that I've
been mentoring a young man


1106
0:51:56,867 --> 0:52:6,133
for several years, and I
just got an opportunity,


1107
0:52:6,133 --> 0:52:8,367
he was in foster
care for 11 years,


1108
0:52:8,367 --> 0:52:13,9
and I just had an opportunity
to robe him at his


1109
0:52:13,9 --> 0:52:15,867
graduation from law school.


1110
0:52:15,867 --> 0:52:16,3
(applause)


1111
0:52:16,3 --> 0:52:23,533
Which is -- and, because a
lot of these kids who have,


1112
0:52:23,533 --> 0:52:27,66
who are disaffected, who have,
whether it's foster care or


1113
0:52:27,66 --> 0:52:32,333
whether it's poverty or
whether -- these are good kids.


1114
0:52:32,333 --> 0:52:37,166
And generally pretty bright if
they're given that opportunity


1115
0:52:37,166 --> 0:52:39,967
to dream and to think
beyond themselves.


1116
0:52:39,967 --> 0:52:43,266
And I think that's the reason
the partnerships -- I will tell


1117
0:52:43,266 --> 0:52:46,8
you that having been now at
state government now in the


1118
0:52:46,8 --> 0:52:50,133
federal government,
government cannot do it all.


1119
0:52:50,133 --> 0:52:54,166
We can provide some resources,
and that's becoming


1120
0:52:54,166 --> 0:52:55,433
more and more limited.


1121
0:52:55,433 --> 0:52:57,5
We can provide some
overall direction,


1122
0:52:57,5 --> 0:53:0,367
but in reality communities have
to take it upon themselves.


1123
0:53:0,367 --> 0:53:4,4
And that's the reason that I
think Big brothers Big Sisters


1124
0:53:4,4 --> 0:53:5,5
are so important.


1125
0:53:5,5 --> 0:53:8,4
I'm also a strong
proponent of Best Buddies,


1126
0:53:8,4 --> 0:53:13,333
because I think they've had this
issue working with kids with


1127
0:53:13,333 --> 0:53:14,5
disabilities.


1128
0:53:14,5 --> 0:53:17,333
So the extent to which
we can work with you,


1129
0:53:17,333 --> 0:53:20,266
I know that these are
particularly tough times to get


1130
0:53:20,266 --> 0:53:24,8
in the door of a state agency,
with the limited budgets that


1131
0:53:24,8 --> 0:53:30,467
they are constricting,
but we have sent out,


1132
0:53:30,467 --> 0:53:33,567
with my counterpart at
the Department of Labor,


1133
0:53:33,567 --> 0:53:39,66
a letter to commissioners around
the country pointing out the use


1134
0:53:39,66 --> 0:53:45,767
of TANF funds and that TANF in
use for summer jobs for young


1135
0:53:45,767 --> 0:53:48,767
kids is an allowable expense
to count against their


1136
0:53:48,767 --> 0:53:49,767
maintenance of effort.


1137
0:53:49,767 --> 0:53:52,9
And that they really ought to
be thinking in those terms.


1138
0:53:52,9 --> 0:53:56,8
I think when you're trying to
access those kind of supports


1139
0:53:56,8 --> 0:53:59,333
from government, it is
important to be a little


1140
0:53:59,333 --> 0:54:2,1
innovative in doing that.


1141
0:54:2,1 --> 0:54:6,66
So I just wanted to take
a few minutes and come by.


1142
0:54:6,66 --> 0:54:8,333
I don't want to take up
too much of your time,


1143
0:54:8,333 --> 0:54:10,0
but I appreciate what you do.


1144
0:54:10,0 --> 0:54:13,8
I'm coming back to Florida
for a day this week, actually.


1145
0:54:13,8 --> 0:54:20,367
I miss Florida, but I like the
rest of the 49 states as well.


1146
0:54:20,367 --> 0:54:21,0
(laughter)


1147
0:54:21,0 --> 0:54:22,333
This is a big country.


1148
0:54:22,333 --> 0:54:26,9
I'd be happy to take a
question or two if I have the


1149
0:54:26,9 --> 0:54:29,1
authorization to do that.


1150
0:54:29,1 --> 0:54:29,9
Yes, ma'am.


1151
0:54:29,9 --> 0:54:34,2
Audience member:
Most TANF funds
are directed to states.


1152
0:54:34,2 --> 0:54:38,0
How can you help us or help
the states understand that TANF


1153
0:54:38,0 --> 0:54:43,734
funds can be used quite
appropriately by an organization


1154
0:54:43,734 --> 0:54:45,9
such as Big Brothers
Big Sisters?


1155
0:54:45,9 --> 0:54:50,633
They really do fit the category
of many of the children --


1156
0:54:50,633 --> 0:54:51,533
George Sheldon:
They do.


1157
0:54:51,533 --> 0:54:54,5
And some that -- are there other
Big Brothers Big Sisters around


1158
0:54:54,5 --> 0:54:57,734
the country who have
access to TANF funds?


1159
0:54:57,734 --> 0:55:0,333
It really, to what
states are you from?


1160
0:55:0,333 --> 0:55:2,0
Audience member:
I'm from Pennsylvania.


1161
0:55:2,0 --> 0:55:2,767
Audience member:
Mississippi.


1162
0:55:2,767 --> 0:55:3,6
Audience member:
I'm from Minnesota.


1163
0:55:3,6 --> 0:55:4,8
Audience member:
Texas.


1164
0:55:4,8 --> 0:55:7,2
George Sheldon:
Has Minnesota accessed --


1165
0:55:7,2 --> 0:55:11,3
Audience member:
We just accessed
TANF funds this year.


1166
0:55:11,3 --> 0:55:13,0
George Sheldon:
The letter that we
sent out -- and I'll


1167
0:55:13,0 --> 0:55:17,3
take another look at it in terms
of guidance to state agencies --


1168
0:55:17,3 --> 0:55:23,433
with Labor, was really
focused on summer jobs,


1169
0:55:23,433 --> 0:55:28,734
but it was also articulating
using local community


1170
0:55:28,734 --> 0:55:30,266
agencies to do that.


1171
0:55:30,266 --> 0:55:34,266
But let me do that, we've had
the same issue with states with


1172
0:55:34,266 --> 0:55:39,1
Boys Clubs Girls Clubs, who have
also attempted to access TANF.


1173
0:55:39,1 --> 0:55:44,767
I would also point out that TANF
used to be almost two-thirds


1174
0:55:44,767 --> 0:55:48,8
direct cash assistance,
and it's now reversed.


1175
0:55:48,8 --> 0:55:53,33
And I believe in
flexibility for the states.


1176
0:55:53,33 --> 0:55:56,7
I mean, coming from the
State, I believe in that.


1177
0:55:56,7 --> 0:55:59,867
But the extent to which we
can give greater guidance,


1178
0:55:59,867 --> 0:56:2,1
I clearly am willing to do that.


1179
0:56:2,1 --> 0:56:3,7
I think they've got to
be innovative with it.


1180
0:56:3,7 --> 0:56:7,633
I also think you all have to be
aggressive, because, you know,


1181
0:56:7,633 --> 0:56:10,734
because they get a lot of asks.


1182
0:56:10,734 --> 0:56:11,834
Yes, sir.


1183
0:56:11,834 --> 0:56:14,5
Audience member:
Thank you for pointing
out the poverty


1184
0:56:14,5 --> 0:56:17,867
statistics, that 50 percent
of children with single-parent


1185
0:56:17,867 --> 0:56:20,834
families are living in poverty.


1186
0:56:20,834 --> 0:56:22,9
Over 80 percent
of the over 200,000


1187
0:56:22,9 --> 0:56:25,533
children in Big Brothers Big
Sisters are from single-parent


1188
0:56:25,533 --> 0:56:26,266
families.


1189
0:56:26,266 --> 0:56:30,166
So we are in that sweet spot.


1190
0:56:30,166 --> 0:56:34,867
In terms of working together,
Big Brothers Big Sisters


1191
0:56:34,867 --> 0:56:38,3
relative to many other mentoring
organizations and youth serving


1192
0:56:38,3 --> 0:56:40,533
organizations has a
tremendous capacity.


1193
0:56:40,533 --> 0:56:42,333
It's been doing research
on youth outcomes,


1194
0:56:42,333 --> 0:56:45,333
continuous research for quality
improvement on match strength


1195
0:56:45,333 --> 0:56:48,767
and match length, and we'd like
to continue to share that with


1196
0:56:48,767 --> 0:56:50,0
the Department of Health
and Human Services.


1197
0:56:50,0 --> 0:56:52,4
It may help you all
as you're informed,


1198
0:56:52,4 --> 0:56:54,3
and inform you as you're
designing and


1199
0:56:54,3 --> 0:56:56,66
developing programs.


1200
0:56:56,66 --> 0:56:58,33
George Sheldon:
I would be very
interested in that because,


1201
0:56:58,33 --> 0:57:1,4
you know, this Administration
has put a heavy emphasis on


1202
0:57:1,4 --> 0:57:4,567
evidence-based research, and
a lot of what we're doing,


1203
0:57:4,567 --> 0:57:6,967
particularly in the
child welfare area,


1204
0:57:6,967 --> 0:57:10,7
is now real
evidence-based practices.


1205
0:57:10,7 --> 0:57:17,8
We've made a major commitment
to trying to deal with trauma


1206
0:57:17,8 --> 0:57:20,567
as an underlying element
in child welfare,


1207
0:57:20,567 --> 0:57:24,66
and I think that same thing is
true with a lot of the kids


1208
0:57:24,66 --> 0:57:27,3
who grew up in poverty,
is the, you know,


1209
0:57:27,3 --> 0:57:29,333
there are some who
call it toxic stress,


1210
0:57:29,333 --> 0:57:33,667
and that toxic stress has
a long-term impact on the


1211
0:57:33,667 --> 0:57:36,433
development of that child.


1212
0:57:36,433 --> 0:57:39,33
So any research you
can share with us,


1213
0:57:39,33 --> 0:57:43,567
I would be very interested in.


1214
0:57:43,567 --> 0:57:48,734
And any of our programs that you
feel like you might be able to


1215
0:57:48,734 --> 0:57:53,7
have some additional insights
in, be aggressive in doing that.


1216
0:57:53,7 --> 0:57:59,0
I learned a new motto in
Texas, I think, which was,


1217
0:57:59,0 --> 0:58:0,9
"In God we trust.


1218
0:58:0,9 --> 0:58:2,633
All others must bring data."


1219
0:58:2,633 --> 0:58:5,433
(laughter)


1220
0:58:5,433 --> 0:58:7,233
And I think we've got
to recognize that.


1221
0:58:7,233 --> 0:58:11,967
The one thing I do, as, the one
thing that I really do -- and I


1222
0:58:11,967 --> 0:58:17,934
am very committed to using
data and analyzing it in an


1223
0:58:17,934 --> 0:58:21,66
evidence-based research fashion,
but I also think it is very


1224
0:58:21,66 --> 0:58:23,433
important to not lose
sight that there are real


1225
0:58:23,433 --> 0:58:29,166
faces behind that data.


1226
0:58:29,166 --> 0:58:34,367
And these kids are as diverse
as they are individuals.


1227
0:58:34,367 --> 0:58:38,5
And I think that's the real
value of this one-on-one


1228
0:58:38,5 --> 0:58:41,133
mentoring program that
you all are talking about,


1229
0:58:41,133 --> 0:58:43,467
is there's a real
recognition of that.


1230
0:58:43,467 --> 0:58:43,9
Yes, ma'am.


1231
0:58:43,9 --> 0:58:45,0
Audience member:
I think you will
be proud to know our


1232
0:58:45,0 --> 0:58:47,5
Big Brother of the Year and our
Big Sister of the Year and their


1233
0:58:47,5 --> 0:58:50,33
Littles, and there's something
special you want to know about


1234
0:58:50,33 --> 0:58:53,1
our Big Brother of the Year and
his Little Brother -- why don't


1235
0:58:53,1 --> 0:58:54,967
you guy stand up --
our Bigs of the Year,


1236
0:58:54,967 --> 0:58:56,5
and tell them where you're from.


1237
0:58:56,5 --> 0:58:58,6
George Sheldon:
Which one's the big one
and which one's the little one?


1238
0:58:58,6 --> 0:58:59,633
(laughter)


1239
0:58:59,633 --> 0:59:2,367
Audience member:
I'm older, and we
live in Tallahassee.


1240
0:59:2,367 --> 0:59:3,834
George Sheldon:
Oh, welcome.


1241
0:59:3,834 --> 0:59:5,166
(applause)


1242
0:59:5,166 --> 0:59:9,166
Audience member:
Born and raised in Tallahassee.


1243
0:59:9,166 --> 0:59:11,33
Lived there all our lives,
so we're Floridians


1244
0:59:11,33 --> 0:59:13,2
through and through.


1245
0:59:13,2 --> 0:59:14,333
It's quite an honor to be here.


1246
0:59:14,333 --> 0:59:15,333
George Sheldon:
Well, thank you.


1247
0:59:15,333 --> 0:59:22,7
I did stay up last night and
watched Florida State


1248
0:59:22,7 --> 0:59:24,0
beat Stanford --


1249
0:59:24,0 --> 0:59:25,166
(laughter)


1250
0:59:25,166 --> 0:59:26,3
-- 18 to 7.


1251
0:59:26,3 --> 0:59:27,2
It was close.


1252
0:59:27,2 --> 0:59:31,6
(laughter)


1253
0:59:31,6 --> 0:59:32,2
Audience member:
Thank you very much.


1254
0:59:32,2 --> 0:59:33,6
Audience member -- (inaudible)


1255
0:59:33,6 --> 0:59:35,8
a year behind --


1256
0:59:35,8 --> 0:59:37,6
George Sheldon:
Stand up.


1257
0:59:37,6 --> 0:59:45,467
(applause)


1258
0:59:45,467 --> 0:59:46,767
Yes, ma'am.


1259
0:59:46,767 --> 0:59:48,867
Audience member:
Thank you very much
for pointing out the


1260
0:59:48,867 --> 0:59:52,767
importance of listening to
the children, and the voices,


1261
0:59:52,767 --> 0:59:55,7
and the impact of
their statements.


1262
0:59:55,7 --> 1:0:0,0
Many of our agencies have
waiting lists where children,


1263
1:0:0,0 --> 1:0:2,367
the parents themselves
have called in.


1264
1:0:2,367 --> 1:0:6,133
They're almost equal the number
of children that we're serving.


1265
1:0:6,133 --> 1:0:10,7
So talk about a groundswell of
support and yearning for the


1266
1:0:10,7 --> 1:0:12,1
kinds of services that we offer.


1267
1:0:12,1 --> 1:0:17,66
How can DHHS either through
policy or resources help us


1268
1:0:17,66 --> 1:0:22,3
address this groundswell, this
massive need that is out there


1269
1:0:22,3 --> 1:0:24,5
for children who
need our service?


1270
1:0:24,5 --> 1:0:26,633
George Sheldon:
Well, and I'll
be honest with you,


1271
1:0:26,633 --> 1:0:30,734
I don't have all the
answers to that question,


1272
1:0:30,734 --> 1:0:35,734
because you've been
reading the newspaper,


1273
1:0:35,734 --> 1:0:38,33
we're dealing with
constricting budgets,


1274
1:0:38,33 --> 1:0:42,333
and that constricting budget
at the federal level is


1275
1:0:42,333 --> 1:0:46,4
impacting state and local's
disproportionately, even,


1276
1:0:46,4 --> 1:0:48,1
if you look at it.


1277
1:0:48,1 --> 1:0:51,1
So I think we've got to be a
little more innovative and a


1278
1:0:51,1 --> 1:0:56,834
little more -- we've got to
do a lot more to integrate our


1279
1:0:56,834 --> 1:1:3,633
programs together, and recognize
that we can no longer afford the


1280
1:1:3,633 --> 1:1:6,266
inefficiency of various
streams of funding.


1281
1:1:6,266 --> 1:1:11,6
And that means, the extent
to which we can -- and we're


1282
1:1:11,6 --> 1:1:13,934
desperately trying to
break the silos down.


1283
1:1:13,934 --> 1:1:16,333
The extent to which we can
integrate what's happening to


1284
1:1:16,333 --> 1:1:21,867
child support around a child,
and that those child support


1285
1:1:21,867 --> 1:1:25,0
dollars are really focused
on going to the child,


1286
1:1:25,0 --> 1:1:28,467
and we've got some policies
forthcoming to do that.


1287
1:1:28,467 --> 1:1:31,5
And the extent to which we
can also leverage


1288
1:1:31,5 --> 1:1:34,667
TANF in that family.


1289
1:1:34,667 --> 1:1:37,367
So I think part of
that is how we do it.


1290
1:1:37,367 --> 1:1:44,4
I think that I would be all ears
for any suggestions that you


1291
1:1:44,4 --> 1:1:48,333
might have as to how efforts
that we have at the federal


1292
1:1:48,333 --> 1:1:50,934
government can greater impact
the ability to do that


1293
1:1:50,934 --> 1:1:52,867
at the local level.


1294
1:1:52,867 --> 1:1:55,834
States are very important
to this process.


1295
1:1:55,834 --> 1:1:59,467
And so I think it is important
to work with your local


1296
1:1:59,467 --> 1:2:4,934
commissioners, in the
children and families area.


1297
1:2:4,934 --> 1:2:11,66
I think TANF is one of the most
flexible that -- I think you do


1298
1:2:11,66 --> 1:2:15,2
need to keep reminding
state agencies, as we will,


1299
1:2:15,2 --> 1:2:19,7
about the flexible use of TANF.


1300
1:2:19,7 --> 1:2:20,667
Yes, sir.


1301
1:2:20,667 --> 1:2:21,633
And then I'll come --


1302
1:2:21,633 --> 1:2:24,166
Audience member:
(inaudible)


1303
1:2:24,166 --> 1:2:28,33
-- receive TANF dollars, would
you be interested or willing


1304
1:2:28,33 --> 1:2:34,66
before you send a letter out to
your states to learn what the 20


1305
1:2:34,66 --> 1:2:38,867
or so Big Brother Big Sister
agencies are doing with creative


1306
1:2:38,867 --> 1:2:40,467
programs and maybe --


1307
1:2:40,467 --> 1:2:41,934
George Sheldon:
You're here in D.C., right?


1308
1:2:41,934 --> 1:2:42,533
Audience member:
Yes.


1309
1:2:42,533 --> 1:2:43,6
George Sheldon:
Yeah, I'd be happy,


1310
1:2:43,6 --> 1:2:47,767
I'd be happy to sit down with
some folks and explore what kind


1311
1:2:47,767 --> 1:2:53,166
of guidance would be helpful,
recognizing the constraints on


1312
1:2:53,166 --> 1:2:57,1
our budget, but I would
be very open to that,


1313
1:2:57,1 --> 1:3:0,934
because I -- as I indicated,
all the knowledge


1314
1:3:0,934 --> 1:3:2,5
doesn't reside here.


1315
1:3:2,5 --> 1:3:3,734
Definitely here.


1316
1:3:3,734 --> 1:3:5,834
But here in D.C.


1317
1:3:5,834 --> 1:3:8,33
Audience member:
Because I'm sure a
lot of other agencies


1318
1:3:8,33 --> 1:3:11,2
across the country are using
TANF dollars, creatively.


1319
1:3:11,2 --> 1:3:14,867
George Sheldon:
Yeah, I think states can
learn from each other.


1320
1:3:14,867 --> 1:3:19,166
And I think one thing
is to get the APHSA,


1321
1:3:19,166 --> 1:3:23,567
the American Public Human
Service Association.


1322
1:3:23,567 --> 1:3:26,0
And I don't mind
engaging with them.


1323
1:3:26,0 --> 1:3:29,0
We also just hired someone away
from the National Governors'


1324
1:3:29,0 --> 1:3:32,9
Association who probably knows
TANF as well as anybody in the


1325
1:3:32,9 --> 1:3:36,0
country, so maybe I
can sit down with her.


1326
1:3:36,0 --> 1:3:39,967
And I promised one and I know
I'm violating a rule --


1327
1:3:39,967 --> 1:3:42,333
Audience member:
(inaudible)


1328
1:3:42,333 --> 1:3:44,967
I think one of the things that
we've been looking at is how we


1329
1:3:44,967 --> 1:3:49,233
can collaborate better
with different agencies,


1330
1:3:49,233 --> 1:3:53,0
and the more that I think the
government and you all who are


1331
1:3:53,0 --> 1:3:58,934
providing us resources can
encourage that collaboration and


1332
1:3:58,934 --> 1:4:2,934
incent those agencies that work
together and get rid of the


1333
1:4:2,934 --> 1:4:6,333
redundancies would
be useful as well.


1334
1:4:6,333 --> 1:4:9,633
George Sheldon:
I appreciate that, and we will. 
Let's get together.


1335
1:4:9,633 --> 1:4:13,8
One thing that we are doing
under the Affordable Care Act,


1336
1:4:13,8 --> 1:4:17,3
the Affordable Care Act,
among other things, you know,


1337
1:4:17,3 --> 1:4:18,8
you can say whatever
you want about it,


1338
1:4:18,8 --> 1:4:21,233
there are a lot of
amazing things about it.


1339
1:4:21,233 --> 1:4:25,533
But what it basically did is it
gave 100 percent federal money


1340
1:4:25,533 --> 1:4:28,0
to develop the information
system for the insurance


1341
1:4:28,0 --> 1:4:32,33
exchanges, 90 percent,
90-10 for Medicaid.


1342
1:4:32,33 --> 1:4:37,633
OMB about six, eight months ago
gave us a waiver so that states


1343
1:4:37,633 --> 1:4:43,7
can now plan that large
technology system and bring


1344
1:4:43,7 --> 1:4:47,233
Human Services in to it, and
Human Services doesn't have to


1345
1:4:47,233 --> 1:4:49,6
share in the cost of
development of the big system.


1346
1:4:49,6 --> 1:4:53,767
So information
sharing is important.


1347
1:4:53,767 --> 1:4:56,6
And I think, frankly,
and a lot of states,


1348
1:4:56,6 --> 1:4:59,133
in their advance
planning documents,


1349
1:4:59,133 --> 1:5:1,734
have really indicated a
willingness to go after those


1350
1:5:1,734 --> 1:5:3,6
dollars and bring
Human Services in.


1351
1:5:3,6 --> 1:5:8,133
I think that is a major step in
breaking down some of the silos.


1352
1:5:8,133 --> 1:5:12,3
In Florida, for instance, I had
real difficulties, for instance,


1353
1:5:12,3 --> 1:5:15,333
getting my agency to talk
to the Medicaid agency.


1354
1:5:15,333 --> 1:5:20,266
And yet Medicaid funded a lot of
services to the people that we


1355
1:5:20,266 --> 1:5:21,266
served.


1356
1:5:21,266 --> 1:5:24,166
And breaking down, and -- I
think this technology


1357
1:5:24,166 --> 1:5:25,166
thing can do that.


1358
1:5:25,166 --> 1:5:28,166
Thank you very much and
come back to Washington.


1359
1:5:28,166 --> 1:5:35,6
(applause)


1360
1:5:35,6 --> 1:5:37,633
Kareem Dale:
All right, thank
you very much to George for


1361
1:5:37,633 --> 1:5:39,8
that valuable information.


1362
1:5:39,8 --> 1:5:42,33
So, as we prepare
to wrap up here,


1363
1:5:42,33 --> 1:5:49,333
our final speaker for today is
a man who needs no introduction,


1364
1:5:49,333 --> 1:5:53,567
a man who actually in my role as
disability policy leader for the


1365
1:5:53,567 --> 1:5:58,9
Administration, is -- the
Department of Justice has done


1366
1:5:58,9 --> 1:6:2,6
an unbelievable job on civil
rights for all Americans,


1367
1:6:2,6 --> 1:6:5,66
including Americans
with disabilities,


1368
1:6:5,66 --> 1:6:9,8
and also whose man is a very
staunch advocate for mentoring


1369
1:6:9,8 --> 1:6:10,934
and the benefits of that.


1370
1:6:10,934 --> 1:6:13,166
I think you're going to hear
a little bit of that


1371
1:6:13,166 --> 1:6:14,166
from him today.


1372
1:6:14,166 --> 1:6:17,8
So without further ado, let
me introduce to you the


1373
1:6:17,8 --> 1:6:21,3
Attorney General of the United
States, Eric H. Holder.


1374
1:6:21,3 --> 1:6:30,367
(applause)


1375
1:6:30,367 --> 1:6:31,834
Attorney General Eric Holder: 
Good afternoon.


1376
1:6:31,834 --> 1:6:33,33
Good afternoon.


1377
1:6:33,33 --> 1:6:33,734
Audience members:
Good afternoon.


1378
1:6:33,734 --> 1:6:35,467
Attorney General Eric Holder:
So I'm the last speaker, huh?


1379
1:6:35,467 --> 1:6:35,967
Audience members:
Yes.


1380
1:6:35,967 --> 1:6:37,166
Attorney General Eric Holder:
I'm all that separates you from


1381
1:6:37,166 --> 1:6:39,3
whatever you're
going to do next.


1382
1:6:39,3 --> 1:6:40,66
Did someone say cocktails?


1383
1:6:40,66 --> 1:6:45,66
Ooh, ooh, ooh, we've
got a live crew here.


1384
1:6:45,66 --> 1:6:46,9
I was told as I
walked in, though,


1385
1:6:46,9 --> 1:6:48,834
this is being live streamed,
which means like, you know,


1386
1:6:48,834 --> 1:6:51,0
my fun quotient went
way down, folks.


1387
1:6:51,0 --> 1:6:51,6
(laughter)


1388
1:6:51,6 --> 1:6:53,4
If it was just
going to be us here,


1389
1:6:53,4 --> 1:6:55,6
we could have some good times,
some jokes, talk about Congress,


1390
1:6:55,6 --> 1:6:57,333
but, you know, I
can't do that now. So.


1391
1:6:57,333 --> 1:7:0,834
(laughter)


1392
1:7:0,834 --> 1:7:1,834
I promise, I promise, I promise.


1393
1:7:1,834 --> 1:7:3,66
I want to thank Kareem
for those kind words,


1394
1:7:3,66 --> 1:7:7,0
and for all that he and his
colleagues at the White House


1395
1:7:7,0 --> 1:7:9,33
Office of Public Engagement
have done to bring us all


1396
1:7:9,33 --> 1:7:10,8
together here today.


1397
1:7:10,8 --> 1:7:12,834
This is something that
for me is a real treat.


1398
1:7:12,834 --> 1:7:14,9
I started out this morning
talking to the League of women


1399
1:7:14,9 --> 1:7:19,33
voters about a whole variety of
things that have been kind of in


1400
1:7:19,33 --> 1:7:22,4
the news lately, and, you know,
voting rights and things like


1401
1:7:22,4 --> 1:7:24,8
that, and this is I think a
good way to bookend what


1402
1:7:24,8 --> 1:7:27,533
otherwise has been a not
really enjoyable day.


1403
1:7:27,533 --> 1:7:30,667
But so I'm glad to
end it with you all.


1404
1:7:30,667 --> 1:7:31,2
(laughter)


1405
1:7:31,2 --> 1:7:32,667
It is really a pleasure
for me to be here with you,


1406
1:7:32,667 --> 1:7:36,767
and a privilege to join
so many advocates, allies,


1407
1:7:36,767 --> 1:7:39,7
and partners in calling
attention to this critical and


1408
1:7:39,7 --> 1:7:42,734
really growing need for
mentors in neighborhoods


1409
1:7:42,734 --> 1:7:43,767
across this country.


1410
1:7:43,767 --> 1:7:48,133
Now for more than a century
Big Brothers and Big Sisters of


1411
1:7:48,133 --> 1:7:51,233
America has led the way in
encouraging community leaders to


1412
1:7:51,233 --> 1:7:55,3
give of their time and talents
to support America's young


1413
1:7:55,3 --> 1:7:57,767
people, especially those
who are at risk and those


1414
1:7:57,767 --> 1:7:59,734
who are in need.


1415
1:7:59,734 --> 1:8:1,6
Last year alone, these
are really pretty amazing


1416
1:8:1,6 --> 1:8:4,934
statistics, more than 350
local Big Brothers Big Sisters


1417
1:8:4,934 --> 1:8:8,5
agencies served over
200,000 children nationwide.


1418
1:8:8,5 --> 1:8:10,166
That is very significant.


1419
1:8:10,166 --> 1:8:12,967
Their ongoing efforts have
raised awareness about the


1420
1:8:12,967 --> 1:8:16,7
importance of positive role
models and demonstrated the


1421
1:8:16,7 --> 1:8:19,934
enduring impact that
each mentor can have.


1422
1:8:19,934 --> 1:8:22,3
So this afternoon I'm
proud to stand with so many


1423
1:8:22,3 --> 1:8:25,433
administration leaders, many
of whom have come by here,


1424
1:8:25,433 --> 1:8:27,8
and understand that at least
some of you had a chance to meet


1425
1:8:27,8 --> 1:8:29,6
the big guy today,
is that right?


1426
1:8:29,6 --> 1:8:32,133
Who got to see the President?


1427
1:8:32,133 --> 1:8:33,367
Don't hate him, don't hate him.


1428
1:8:33,367 --> 1:8:35,166
(laughter)


1429
1:8:35,166 --> 1:8:36,166
All right.


1430
1:8:36,166 --> 1:8:39,133
How was that selection
determination made?


1431
1:8:39,133 --> 1:8:41,9
Audience member:
Big Brother of the year,
2011 and 2012 --


1432
1:8:41,9 --> 1:8:44,166
(inaudible)


1433
1:8:44,166 --> 1:8:45,3
Attorney General Eric Holder: Okay.


1434
1:8:45,3 --> 1:8:47,3
And how was it decided
who would meet with me?


1435
1:8:47,3 --> 1:8:49,767
(laughter)


1436
1:8:49,767 --> 1:8:51,7
Everybody, right?


1437
1:8:51,7 --> 1:8:52,3
Audience member:
Everybody --


1438
1:8:52,3 --> 1:8:53,433
(inaudible)


1439
1:8:53,433 --> 1:8:54,433
Attorney General Eric Holder:
That's all right, no, no,


1440
1:8:54,433 --> 1:8:56,166
don't try to clean it up, don't
try to clean it up, that's okay.


1441
1:8:56,166 --> 1:8:58,667
All right.


1442
1:8:58,667 --> 1:9:0,767
But I am really proud to stand
with so many people from the


1443
1:9:0,767 --> 1:9:4,433
Administration in celebrating
this organization's


1444
1:9:4,433 --> 1:9:7,834
accomplishments, and commending
you on yet really another


1445
1:9:7,834 --> 1:9:9,467
extraordinary year.


1446
1:9:9,467 --> 1:9:12,5
But I also recognize that this
leadership summit is much more


1447
1:9:12,5 --> 1:9:15,767
than an occasion for reflecting
on the record of success that


1448
1:9:15,767 --> 1:9:17,133
you have helped to establish.


1449
1:9:17,133 --> 1:9:21,0
It also presents an opportunity
to recommit ourselves to


1450
1:9:21,0 --> 1:9:24,66
building on this progress and to
continuing the unfinished work


1451
1:9:24,66 --> 1:9:26,5
that still stands before us.


1452
1:9:26,5 --> 1:9:29,734
Today, again some other
startling statistics: More than


1453
1:9:29,734 --> 1:9:32,734
a million students drop out
of high school every year,


1454
1:9:32,734 --> 1:9:35,567
and many of those kids
start down the wrong path,


1455
1:9:35,567 --> 1:9:39,33
turning to violence, criminal
behavior, substance abuse,


1456
1:9:39,33 --> 1:9:42,333
and just over 2 million
kids per year are arrested.


1457
1:9:42,333 --> 1:9:44,734
A third of all children
and half of all low-income


1458
1:9:44,734 --> 1:9:48,3
youth fail to graduate
from high school on time.


1459
1:9:48,3 --> 1:9:51,233
Nearly a third of those between
the ages of 12 and 17 have


1460
1:9:51,233 --> 1:9:54,8
recently reported using
alcohol or marijuana,


1461
1:9:54,8 --> 1:9:57,166
and today one in four violent
crime victims known to law


1462
1:9:57,166 --> 1:10:0,333
enforcement -- children, think
about that -- one in four


1463
1:10:0,333 --> 1:10:3,633
violent crime victims known to
law enforcement are children.


1464
1:10:3,633 --> 1:10:6,734
Now you've heard, you know,
these alarming statistics.


1465
1:10:6,734 --> 1:10:8,433
You're familiar with the
heartbreaking stories and


1466
1:10:8,433 --> 1:10:12,0
probably have seen some of
this harsh reality firsthand.


1467
1:10:12,0 --> 1:10:15,433
You also understand that we have
a responsibility to confront


1468
1:10:15,433 --> 1:10:18,133
this problem, and you've led
the way in responding to this


1469
1:10:18,133 --> 1:10:22,9
crisis, not with despair,
but with resolve.


1470
1:10:22,9 --> 1:10:25,734
By serving as the role models
that so many children lack,


1471
1:10:25,734 --> 1:10:28,834
you've shown how mentors can
teach really invaluable lessons,


1472
1:10:28,834 --> 1:10:31,7
help young people develop the
skills they need for future


1473
1:10:31,7 --> 1:10:36,233
success, and instill a sense
of self worth and self respect.


1474
1:10:36,233 --> 1:10:38,734
You have proven that
mentors can fill a void,


1475
1:10:38,734 --> 1:10:42,533
helping to guide and encourage
children as they set and achieve


1476
1:10:42,533 --> 1:10:45,66
goals and develop the
confidence necessary to


1477
1:10:45,66 --> 1:10:46,8
fulfill their potential.


1478
1:10:46,8 --> 1:10:49,567
Now, studies have really
consistently shown that through


1479
1:10:49,567 --> 1:10:53,533
stable and consistent,
consistent personal engagement,


1480
1:10:53,533 --> 1:10:56,8
mentored children are more
likely to grow and mature


1481
1:10:56,8 --> 1:11:0,433
into confident and
responsible young adults.


1482
1:11:0,433 --> 1:11:2,633
Now one report found that
children matched with a Big


1483
1:11:2,633 --> 1:11:6,4
Brother or a Big Sister were
nearly 50 percent less likely to


1484
1:11:6,4 --> 1:11:9,834
begin using illegal drugs and
more than 50 percent less


1485
1:11:9,834 --> 1:11:11,5
likely to skip school.


1486
1:11:11,5 --> 1:11:12,9
Great statistics.


1487
1:11:12,9 --> 1:11:15,633
Over the years we've also seen
that investing in mentoring


1488
1:11:15,633 --> 1:11:17,934
programs makes basic
economic sense.


1489
1:11:17,934 --> 1:11:20,7
This is a time of, you know,
great economic problems we've


1490
1:11:20,7 --> 1:11:23,667
had in terms of budgets and
things like that nature.


1491
1:11:23,667 --> 1:11:26,133
In fact if we were to increase
the high school graduation rate


1492
1:11:26,133 --> 1:11:28,7
among male students
by just 5 percent,


1493
1:11:28,7 --> 1:11:31,66
estimates suggest that our
country would save close to $8


1494
1:11:31,66 --> 1:11:33,734
billion in criminal
justice spending.


1495
1:11:33,734 --> 1:11:36,467
So there's a direct correlation
between those things.


1496
1:11:36,467 --> 1:11:40,5
But as I'm sure we can all
say from personal experience,


1497
1:11:40,5 --> 1:11:42,934
one of the greatest joys of
mentoring is that the benefits


1498
1:11:42,934 --> 1:11:43,967
really run both ways.


1499
1:11:43,967 --> 1:11:46,633
It doesn't just go to the kids.


1500
1:11:46,633 --> 1:11:49,1
During my time as United States
Attorney for the District of


1501
1:11:49,1 --> 1:11:51,633
Columbia during the
Clinton Administration,


1502
1:11:51,633 --> 1:11:54,4
my staff and I adopted
an elementary school in a


1503
1:11:54,4 --> 1:11:57,133
low-income, predominantly
African-American part of


1504
1:11:57,133 --> 1:11:58,2
Washington, D.C.


1505
1:11:58,2 --> 1:12:1,633
I was really thrilled to have a
chance to work with these kids


1506
1:12:1,633 --> 1:12:4,433
on a regular basis,
getting to know them,


1507
1:12:4,433 --> 1:12:6,367
becoming invested
in their futures,


1508
1:12:6,367 --> 1:12:9,667
and finding a remarkable and
rewarding sense of purpose in


1509
1:12:9,667 --> 1:12:12,967
the relationships that we
developed in my office and


1510
1:12:12,967 --> 1:12:14,367
with that school.


1511
1:12:14,367 --> 1:12:17,166
As a result, I'm really proud
to say that I know well and have


1512
1:12:17,166 --> 1:12:20,1
seen firsthand that
mentoring changes lives,


1513
1:12:20,1 --> 1:12:22,66
and not just for the students.


1514
1:12:22,66 --> 1:12:25,467
The prosecutors in my office,
hard-boiled, you know,


1515
1:12:25,467 --> 1:12:29,33
long-time prosecutors, were
changed as a result of their


1516
1:12:29,33 --> 1:12:32,266
interaction with these kids
at Amidon Elementary School.


1517
1:12:32,266 --> 1:12:34,433
And that's one of the many
reasons why I've been honored


1518
1:12:34,433 --> 1:12:37,266
to join the President,
the First Lady,


1519
1:12:37,266 --> 1:12:39,867
and others throughout the
Administration in supporting


1520
1:12:39,867 --> 1:12:40,934
mentoring programs.


1521
1:12:40,934 --> 1:12:43,734
We've made great strides
in bringing stakeholders,


1522
1:12:43,734 --> 1:12:46,633
including federal officials,
state and local partners,


1523
1:12:46,633 --> 1:12:49,9
community organizations, and
leaders like yourselves together


1524
1:12:49,9 --> 1:12:53,967
to discuss how mentors can
improve educational outcomes and


1525
1:12:53,967 --> 1:12:56,0
to reduce juvenile delinquency.


1526
1:12:56,0 --> 1:12:59,7
And I believe that there's good
reason to be optimistic about


1527
1:12:59,7 --> 1:13:1,767
the continued progress
that we'll achieve through


1528
1:13:1,767 --> 1:13:4,567
initiatives like the First
Lady's Corporate Mentoring


1529
1:13:4,567 --> 1:13:8,133
Challenge, as additional
partners rally to this effort,


1530
1:13:8,133 --> 1:13:11,934
and in the robust, ongoing work
of today's Justice Department.


1531
1:13:11,934 --> 1:13:14,3
Over the last three years my
colleagues and I have made a


1532
1:13:14,3 --> 1:13:17,367
strong and in some cases really
unprecedented commitment to


1533
1:13:17,367 --> 1:13:20,7
expanding federal assistance
for mentoring initiatives and


1534
1:13:20,7 --> 1:13:24,233
exploring evidence-based
strategies for reducing


1535
1:13:24,233 --> 1:13:26,2
children's exposure to violence.


1536
1:13:26,2 --> 1:13:30,6
Since 1994, the Department's
Office of Juvenile Justice and


1537
1:13:30,6 --> 1:13:34,233
Delinquency Prevention has
awarded more than $480 million


1538
1:13:34,233 --> 1:13:36,567
to support mentoring programs.


1539
1:13:36,567 --> 1:13:40,767
(applause)


1540
1:13:40,767 --> 1:13:44,3
And there was a direct
connection between great


1541
1:13:44,3 --> 1:13:46,8
mentoring and good
anti-crime efforts.


1542
1:13:46,8 --> 1:13:49,467
People sometimes don't
see that connection,


1543
1:13:49,467 --> 1:13:51,633
but we certainly realize
that that exists in this


1544
1:13:51,633 --> 1:13:52,633
Justice Department.


1545
1:13:52,633 --> 1:13:56,3
This past March we announced a
$20 million grant solicitation


1546
1:13:56,3 --> 1:13:59,367
for research proposals that can
give us a better sense of


1547
1:13:59,367 --> 1:14:2,467
which of these programs
are most effective.


1548
1:14:2,467 --> 1:14:5,5
Now, these investments will
help to strengthen the progress


1549
1:14:5,5 --> 1:14:8,367
that's been made through the
Department's Defending Childhood


1550
1:14:8,367 --> 1:14:12,266
Initiative, which was launched
in 2010 as part of an effort to


1551
1:14:12,266 --> 1:14:15,0
help us better understand
and more effectively


1552
1:14:15,0 --> 1:14:17,133
combat youth violence.


1553
1:14:17,133 --> 1:14:19,867
And it will build upon a
critical work that's under way


1554
1:14:19,867 --> 1:14:23,367
in ten cities nationwide
as part of the National Forum on


1555
1:14:23,367 --> 1:14:24,467
Youth Violence Prevention.


1556
1:14:24,467 --> 1:14:27,5
Now as a result of these really
broad-based collaborative


1557
1:14:27,5 --> 1:14:30,333
efforts, I think that we're
making meaningful, measurable,


1558
1:14:30,333 --> 1:14:33,433
measurable progress in
assisting the young people who


1559
1:14:33,433 --> 1:14:35,5
need our help the most.


1560
1:14:35,5 --> 1:14:38,667
But as you all know, this
work is far from over.


1561
1:14:38,667 --> 1:14:41,8
Countless at-risk
youth, foster kids,


1562
1:14:41,8 --> 1:14:45,33
young people in tribal lands
and juvenile offenders rejoining


1563
1:14:45,33 --> 1:14:48,6
their communities are really
still in desperate need of our


1564
1:14:48,6 --> 1:14:52,66
help, and every last one of
them must continue to be the top


1565
1:14:52,66 --> 1:14:55,2
priority for each
and every one of us.


1566
1:14:55,2 --> 1:14:57,633
Now it's no exaggeration to say
that our nation's future will be


1567
1:14:57,633 --> 1:15:1,9
defined and its progress
determined by the support that


1568
1:15:1,9 --> 1:15:6,2
we offer and the doors that
we open for our young people.


1569
1:15:6,2 --> 1:15:8,6
But as I look out
over this crowd today,


1570
1:15:8,6 --> 1:15:12,1
I cannot help but feel confident
in our ability to rise to this


1571
1:15:12,1 --> 1:15:14,433
challenge and to bring
about the change that our


1572
1:15:14,433 --> 1:15:16,4
young people deserve.


1573
1:15:16,4 --> 1:15:19,266
Never forget that they
are depending on us.


1574
1:15:19,266 --> 1:15:21,6
These kids are depending on us.


1575
1:15:21,6 --> 1:15:23,533
And know that
President Obama and I,


1576
1:15:23,533 --> 1:15:25,8
along with so many others
in this Administration,


1577
1:15:25,8 --> 1:15:28,967
are counting on each of you to
keep up your outstanding work


1578
1:15:28,967 --> 1:15:31,7
and to continue driving
these efforts forward.


1579
1:15:31,7 --> 1:15:34,2
I look forward to working with
you all in the coming months


1580
1:15:34,2 --> 1:15:37,233
and years to make
America what it should be for


1581
1:15:37,233 --> 1:15:38,7
all of our children.


1582
1:15:38,7 --> 1:15:39,4
Thank you so much.


1583
1:15:39,4 --> 1:15:56,567
(applause)


1584
1:15:56,567 --> 1:15:56,1
Kareem Dale:
All right.


1585
1:15:56,1 --> 1:16:1,1
Well, I guess that brings
us to the conclusion of


1586
1:16:1,1 --> 1:16:2,867
our event today.


1587
1:16:2,867 --> 1:16:6,567
A few things that I
want to touch on before we


1588
1:16:6,567 --> 1:16:10,2
let you all depart.


1589
1:16:10,2 --> 1:16:12,8
One encouragement or two
encouragements, maybe,


1590
1:16:12,8 --> 1:16:15,834
and then one announcement
of something you all


1591
1:16:15,834 --> 1:16:17,66
can take with you.


1592
1:16:17,66 --> 1:16:20,33
The two encouragements
are, number one,


1593
1:16:20,33 --> 1:16:22,233
we need you all to get involved.


1594
1:16:22,233 --> 1:16:25,467
And we need you all to get
involved for yourselves,


1595
1:16:25,467 --> 1:16:27,834
for your communities, but
for your young people,


1596
1:16:27,834 --> 1:16:30,767
and not just only on mentoring.


1597
1:16:30,767 --> 1:16:33,834
You've heard a lot today about
mentoring and the things that


1598
1:16:33,834 --> 1:16:36,5
are great about Big
Brothers Big Sisters,


1599
1:16:36,5 --> 1:16:39,3
but there's a lot that this
President is fighting for that


1600
1:16:39,3 --> 1:16:43,5
benefits you all, but that even
more importantly benefits


1601
1:16:43,5 --> 1:16:44,633
the future of our country.


1602
1:16:44,633 --> 1:16:46,467
And that's the young
people that you all mentor.


1603
1:16:46,467 --> 1:16:48,633
So we need you all
to get involved.


1604
1:16:48,633 --> 1:16:51,567
We believe that the President,
the Attorney General,


1605
1:16:51,567 --> 1:16:56,33
and so many others in our
Administration are fighting for


1606
1:16:56,33 --> 1:17:1,133
Americans, fighting for
Americans to be able to achieve.


1607
1:17:1,133 --> 1:17:5,2
And so we need you all
involved in that effort.


1608
1:17:5,2 --> 1:17:8,667
The second encouragement really
relates to getting involved.


1609
1:17:8,667 --> 1:17:10,4
And I'll give you an
example of, you know,


1610
1:17:10,4 --> 1:17:12,8
things that you can
do to get involved.


1611
1:17:12,8 --> 1:17:15,967
We need you to be aware of
what we're doing and the fights


1612
1:17:15,967 --> 1:17:18,767
that are going on in our
country right now.


1613
1:17:18,767 --> 1:17:23,1
One that I think should be near
and dear to your heart is the


1614
1:17:23,1 --> 1:17:25,934
fight that's going on right
now regarding student loans.


1615
1:17:25,934 --> 1:17:28,333
And I don't know if all of
you all have heard about that,


1616
1:17:28,333 --> 1:17:31,567
but the rates for
college students,


1617
1:17:31,567 --> 1:17:36,4
some of whom are here today,
just some college students,


1618
1:17:36,4 --> 1:17:40,433
the rates on college student
loans are going to double if


1619
1:17:40,433 --> 1:17:44,3
Congress doesn't pass
action to stop those rates


1620
1:17:44,3 --> 1:17:46,4
from doubling by July.


1621
1:17:46,4 --> 1:17:52,533
And so the President has been
vocal in his support for not


1622
1:17:52,533 --> 1:17:56,8
doubling student loan rates and
for making sure that students


1623
1:17:56,8 --> 1:17:59,33
don't have that happen to them.


1624
1:17:59,33 --> 1:18:1,66
They are the future
of our country,


1625
1:18:1,66 --> 1:18:4,333
and the President has been
pushing for that effort.


1626
1:18:4,333 --> 1:18:7,6
We need you all to get involved
and support that effort for the


1627
1:18:7,6 --> 1:18:10,6
student loans, the student
loan rates not to double.


1628
1:18:10,6 --> 1:18:13,934
There are all types
of Twitter, hashtags,


1629
1:18:13,934 --> 1:18:15,633
if you will -- they've told
me that's what it's called,


1630
1:18:15,633 --> 1:18:18,133
I'm not a Twitter guy myself.


1631
1:18:18,133 --> 1:18:21,567
But there are hashtags involved,
I'm sure there's stuff on


1632
1:18:21,567 --> 1:18:24,133
Facebook, I'm sure the
students have heard about it,


1633
1:18:24,133 --> 1:18:26,734
I'm sure that many of you all in
this room have heard about it,


1634
1:18:26,734 --> 1:18:30,633
but this is impacting the
students that you are mentoring


1635
1:18:30,633 --> 1:18:33,8
now, for those who are in
college or who are maybe getting


1636
1:18:33,8 --> 1:18:35,967
ready to graduate from college,
and those who are coming up in


1637
1:18:35,967 --> 1:18:38,667
the future who are
preparing to go to college.


1638
1:18:38,667 --> 1:18:41,1
And this is an important
fight, and so we need you


1639
1:18:41,1 --> 1:18:43,3
all's voices to be heard.


1640
1:18:43,3 --> 1:18:45,734
And for you all to get engaged
and know what's going on in your


1641
1:18:45,734 --> 1:18:48,7
community and support
the effort for student loan


1642
1:18:48,7 --> 1:18:49,7
rates to not double.


1643
1:18:49,7 --> 1:18:52,633
That's just one example of the
many things that are going on


1644
1:18:52,633 --> 1:18:54,934
in this country and that are
going to be going on over the


1645
1:18:54,934 --> 1:18:56,934
next five or six months.


1646
1:18:56,934 --> 1:19:1,433
So I strongly encourage you all
to pay attention to what's going


1647
1:19:1,433 --> 1:19:6,2
on, get involved on behalf
of yourselves, your families,


1648
1:19:6,2 --> 1:19:10,66
and the students who represent
the future of this country.


1649
1:19:10,66 --> 1:19:12,667
So thank you all very, very
much for joining us today.


1650
1:19:12,667 --> 1:19:14,33
We're delighted to have you all.


1651
1:19:14,33 --> 1:19:16,233
Please stay in touch, please
check out our White House


1652
1:19:16,233 --> 1:19:19,867
website, as I talked
about, and stay involved.


1653
1:19:19,867 --> 1:19:23,7
And then as you depart here
to my left and your right,


1654
1:19:23,7 --> 1:19:29,8
we do have copies of President
Obama's proclamation from


1655
1:19:29,8 --> 1:19:31,533
last year on mentoring.


1656
1:19:31,533 --> 1:19:34,967
I forgot the month that it was
--it's national mentoring month


1657
1:19:34,967 --> 1:19:35,7
Audience members:
January.


1658
1:19:35,7 --> 1:19:37,533
Kareem Dale:
Yeah. So everybody knows that.


1659
1:19:37,533 --> 1:19:38,834
(laughter)


1660
