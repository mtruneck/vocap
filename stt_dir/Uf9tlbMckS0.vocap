###13 Professor Paul Bloom: This class today is about
###16 language. And language is,
###18 to a large extent, where the action is.
###23 The study of human language has been the battleground over
###26 different theories of human nature.
###28 So, every philosopher or psychologist or humanist or
###32 neuroscientist who has ever thought about people has had to
###36 make some claim about the nature of language and how it works.
###40 I'm including here people like Aristotle and Plato,
###43 Hume, Locke, Freud and Skinner.
###45 I'm also including modern-day approaches to computational
###49 theory, cognitive neuroscience, evolutionary theory and
###53 cultural psychology. If you hope to make it with a
###56 theory of what people are and how people work,
###60 you have to explain and talk about language.
###63 In fact, language is sufficiently interesting that,
###66 unlike most other things I'll talk about in this class,
###70 there is an entire field devoted to its study,
###73 the field of linguistics that is entirely devoted to studying
###77 the nuances and structures of different languages.
###81 Now, I'll first, before getting into details,
###83 make a definitional point. When I'm talking about language
###87 I'm meaning systems like English and Dutch and Warlpiri and
###92 Italian and Turkish and Urdu and what we've seen and heard right
###96 now in class in the demonstration that preceded the
###100 formal lecture. Now, you could use language in
###104 a different sense. You could use the term
###107 "language" to describe what dogs do, or what chimpanzees do,
###111 or birds. You could use language to
###113 describe music, talk about the--a musical
###116 language or art, or any communicative system,
###119 and there's actually nothing wrong with that.
###122 There's no rule about how you're supposed to use the word
###125 "language." But the problem is if you use
###127 the word "language" impossibly, incredibly broadly,
###130 then from a scientific point of view it becomes useless to ask
###134 interesting questions about it. If language can refer to just
###137 about everything from English to traffic signals,
###141 then we're not going to be able to find interesting
###143 generalizations or do good science about it.
###146 So, what I want to do is, I want to discuss the
###148 scientific notion of language, at first restricting myself to
###152 systems like English and Dutch and American sign language and
###157 Navajo and so on. Once we've made some
###160 generalizations about language in this narrow sense,
###163 we could then ask, and we will ask,
###166 to what extent do other systems such as animal communication
###171 systems relate to this narrower definition.
###174 So we could ask, in this narrow sense,
###176 what properties do languages have and then go on to ask,
###179 in a broader sense, what other communicative
###181 systems also possess those properties.
###184 Well, some things are obvious about language so here are some;
###189 here are the questions we will ask.
###191 This will frame our discussion today.
###193 We'll first go over some basic facts about language.
###195 We'll talk about what languages share, we'll talk about how
###198 language develops, and we'll talk about language
###201 and communication in nonhumans. I began this class with a
###205 demonstration of--that illustrates two very important
###210 facts about language. One is that languages all share
###215 some deep and intricate universals.
###219 In particular, all languages,
###221 at minimum, are powerful enough to convey an abstract notion
###225 like this; abstract in the sense that it
###227 talks about thoughts and it talks about a proposition and
###231 spatial relations in objects. There's no language in the
###235 world that you just cannot talk about abstract things with.
###239 Every language can do this. But the demonstration also
###242 illustrated another fact about language, which is how different
###246 languages are. They sound different.
###248 If you know one language, you don't necessarily know
###251 another. It's not merely that you can't
###254 understand it. It could sound strange or look
###257 unusual in the case of a sign language.
###260 And so, any adequate theory of language has to allow for both
###265 the commonalities and the differences across languages.
###270 And this is the puzzle faced by the psychology and cognitive
###273 science of language. Well, let's start with an
###277 interesting claim about language made by Charles Darwin.
###281 So, Darwin writes, "Man has an instinctive
###283 tendency to speak, as we see in the babble of our
###287 young children, while no child has an
###290 instinctive tendency to bake, brew or write."
###293 And what Darwin is claiming here, and it's a controversial
###297 and interesting claim, is that language is special in
###300 that there's some sort of propensity or capacity or
###304 instinct for language unlike the other examples he gives.
###309 Not everything comes natural to us but Darwin suggests that
###313 language does. Well, why should we believe
###315 this? Well, there are some basic
###318 facts that support Darwin's claim.
###322 For one thing, every normal--every human
###325 society has language. In the course of traveling,
###329 cultures encounter other cultures and they often
###332 encounter cultures that are very different from their own.
###336 But through the course of human history, nobody has ever
###339 encountered another group of humans that did not have a
###342 language. Does this show that it's built
###345 in? Well, not necessarily.
###348 It could be a cultural innovation.
###351 It could be, for instance,
###352 that language is such a good idea that every culture comes
###356 across it and develops it. Just about every culture uses
###361 some sort of utensils to eat food with, a knife and a fork,
###365 chopsticks, a spoon. This probably is not because
###369 use of eating utensils is human nature, but rather,
###373 it's because it's just a very useful thing that cultures
###376 discover over and over again. Well, we know that this
###380 probably is not true with regard to language.
###383 And one reason we know this is because of the demonstrated case
###389 studies where a language is created within a single
###394 generation. And these case studies have
###398 happened over history. The standard example is people
###403 involved in the slave trade. The slave trade revolving
###408 around tobacco or cotton or coffee or sugar would tend to
###411 mix slaves and laborers from different language backgrounds,
###415 in part deliberately, so as to avoid the possibility
###419 of revolt. What would happen is these
###421 people who were enslaved from different cultures would develop
###424 a makeshift communication system so they could talk to one
###427 another. And this is called a "pidgin,"
###431 p-i-d-g-i-n, a pidgin. And this pidgin was how they
###435 would talk. And this pidgin was not a
###437 language. It was strings of words
###439 borrowed from the different languages around them and put
###442 together in sort of haphazard ways.
###445 The question is what happens to the children who are raised in
###449 this society. And you might expect it that
###452 they would come to speak a pidgin, but they don't.
###456 What happens is, in the course of a single
###459 generation, they develop their own language.
###462 They create a language with rich syntax and morphology and
###466 phonology, terms that we'll understand in a few minutes.
###470 And this language that they create is called a "creole."
###474 And languages that we know now as creoles, the word refers back
###479 to their history. That means that they were
###481 developed from pidgins. And this is interesting because
###485 this suggests that to some extent the ability to use and
###488 understand and learn language is part of human nature.
###492 It doesn't require an extensive cultural history.
###494 Rather, just about any normal child, even when not exposed to
###498 a full-fledged language, can create a language.
###501 And more recently, there's been case studies of
###505 children who acquire sign language.
###507 There's a wonderful case in Nicaragua in sign language where
###511 they acquire sign language from adults who themselves are not
###516 versed in sign language. They're sort of second-language
###519 learners struggling along. What you might have expected
###522 would be the children would then use whatever system their adults
###525 use, but they don't. They "creolized" it.
###528 They take this makeshift communication system developed
###531 by adults and, again,
###532 they turn it into a full-blown language, suggesting that to
###536 some extent it's part of our human nature to create
###540 languages. Also, every normal human has
###546 language. Not everybody in this room can
###549 ride a bicycle. Not everybody in this room can
###552 play chess. But everybody possesses at
###555 least one language. And everybody started to
###559 possess at least one language when they were a child.
###562 There are exceptions, but the exceptions come about
###566 due to some sort of brain damage.
###568 Any neurologically normal human will come to possess a language.
###573 What else do we know? Well, the claim that language
###578 is part of human nature is supported by neurological
###582 studies, some of which were referred to
###585 in the chapters on the brain that you read earlier that talk
###589 about dedicated parts of the brain that work for language.
###592 And if parts of these brains--if parts--if these parts
###596 of the brain are damaged you get language deficits or aphasias
###600 where you might lose the ability to understand or create
###604 language. More speculatively,
###606 there has been some fairly recent work studying the genetic
###611 basis of language, looking at the genes that are
###616 directly responsible for the capacity to learn and use
###620 language. And one bit of evidence that
###623 these genes are implicated is that some unfortunate people
###627 have point mutations in these genes.
###629 And such people are unable to learn and use language.
###633 So, in general, there is some support,
###635 at least at a very broad level, for the claim that language is
###639 in some sense part of human nature.
###642 Well, what do we mean by language?
###644 What are we talking about when we talk about language?
###646 We don't want to restrict ourselves, for instance,
###648 to English or French. What do all languages share?
###653 Well, all languages are creative and this means a couple
###660 of things. One meaning is the meaning
###664 emphasized by Rene Descartes. When Rene Descartes argued that
###669 we are more than merely machines, his best piece of
###672 evidence for him was the human capacity for language.
###675 No machine could do this because our capacity for
###679 language is unbounded and free. We could say anything we choose
###683 to say. We have free will.
###685 And in fact, language allows us to produce a
###689 virtual infinity of sentences. So, we could create and
###693 understand sentences that we never heard before.
###695 And there are a lot of sentences.
###698 So, if you want to estimate how many grammatical sentences under
###704 twenty words in English, the answer is,
###709 "a lot." And what this means is that any
###713 theory of language use and language comprehension cannot
###718 simply appeal to a list. When you understand a sentence
###722 I said you have to have the capacity to understand a
###725 sentence even if you've never heard it before.
###727 And this is because we could effortlessly produce and
###731 understand sentences that no human has ever said before on
###736 earth. Would anybody volunteer to say
###738 a sentence, non obscene, non derogatory,
###741 that has never been spoken before on earth,
###744 ever?
###744 
###749 Here. I'll start.
###755 "It's surprisingly easy to get a purple tie on eBay if you
###759 don't care much about quality." I could imagine no one else in
###763 the world has said this before. "I am upset that one cannot
###767 easily download 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' through iTunes."
###772 Now, it's possible somebody said both these sentences
###776 before, but you probably have not heard them.
###780 But you understand them immediately.
###783 So, how do you do it? Well, you have rules in your
###788 head. You've learnt what the words
###791 mean, but you have abstract and unconscious rules that take
###795 these words, figure out the order,
###798 and in a fraction of a second, give rise to understanding.
###802 And that's the sort of thing linguists study.
###804 So, take some standard examples from the linguistic study of
###810 English. And bear in mind the rules
###812 we're talking about here are not rules you explicitly know.
###816 They're automatic rules of the same sort we're going to talk
###820 about in the context of visual perception in that they're
###824 implicit and unconscious and not accessible to explicit
###827 understanding. So for instance,
###830 immediately you read "The pig is eager to eat" versus "The pig
###835 is easy to eat" and in a fraction of a second you know
###839 there's an important difference. "The pig is eager to eat" means
###844 the state of affairs that we're talking about is when the pig
###847 does the eating. "The pig is easy to eat" is
###850 when the pig is being eaten. You would see a sentence like
###854 "Bill knew that John liked him" and you know,
###857 without even knowing how you know,
###859 that this could mean that Bill knew that John liked Bill or it
###864 could mean that Bill knew that John liked Fred.
###868 But it can't mean that Bill knew that John liked John.
###872 The natural interpretation, in fact, is that Bill knew that
###875 John liked Bill. The two words co-refer.
###879 Contrast that with "Bill knew that John liked himself," which
###882 only has the meaning Bill knew that John liked John.
###886 And this is what linguists do for a living so if you hear me
###889 talking about this and say, "I want to spend the next forty
###892 years of my life studying that," you should become a linguist.
###896 But that's the sort of--those are the sort of phenomena that
###899 we're interested in. Now, it gets more complicated.
###902 Those are examples from syntax, but language has many
###905 structures. Language has structures going
###908 from the bottom to the top. All languages--All human
###912 languages have phonology, which is the system of sounds
###917 or signs; morphology, which is the system
###921 of words or morphemes, basic units of meaning;
###926 and syntax, which refer to rules and principles that put
###930 together words and phrases into meaningful utterances.
###934 And I want to talk briefly about each of these three parts
###938 of language before looking at some other issues.
###942 I'm indebted here to Steven Pinker's excellent book The
###945 Language Instinct which provides, I think,
###947 a superb discussion of these phenomena.
###949 And I'm going to steal some of my examples from Pinker.
###953 So, phonology. Phonology is the system of
###959 sounds that languages have.
###961 
###968 There's a subset. There's a list,
###971 a finite list, of possible sounds that
###973 language can use. I'm going to put aside for the
###975 moment the question of sign languages and how they work.
###978 I'm going to talk about them in a little bit.
###980 The idea is that English has about forty of these phonemes.
###985 So, if you're a native monolingual speaker of English
###989 you hear speech and each sound you hear is categorized as
###993 falling into one of those forty morphemes--sorry,
###997 phonemes. So, for example,
###999 English has a phoneme of "lu," "l," and a phoneme of "r."
###1006 And so, an English speaker can hear the difference between
###1010 "lip" and "rip" and that corresponds to two different
###1013 words in English. Other languages don't have that
###1017 distinction and so those distinctions are very difficult
###1021 for non-native English speakers to learn.
###1024 So, part of what goes on when you learn, is you have to learn
###1029 the language--the phonemes that your language has.
###1032 Another part of the problem of learning language is you have to
###1037 figure out what the boundaries are between the words.
###1040 You have to use sound signals to figure out the boundaries
###1043 between the words. Now that--If the only language
###1046 you've ever heard is English, that's going to seem like a
###1049 really weird example of a problem because you're listening
###1053 to me speak and in between each of my words you're hearing a
###1056 pause. You don't have to be very smart
###1058 to figure out where one word begins and one word ends.
###1061 But the pause is a psychological illusion.
###1065 If you were to just talk into an oscilloscope that measured
###1069 your sound vibrations, there are no pauses between the
###1072 words. Rather, the pauses are inserted
###1075 by your mind as you already know where one word begins and
###1079 another one ends. And you insert a pause at that
###1083 point. You could see this when you
###1085 hear a language you don't already know.
###1089 So, for those of you who have never heard French before,
###1092 when you hear somebody say, "Je ne sais pas" you could say,
###1095 "Remarkable! French has no pauses between
###1098 words." And you-- And now a French
###1101 speaker, of course, hears "Je ne sais pas."
###1104 For Hebrew, I know one sentence in Hebrew: "Sleecha,
###1108 eypho ha-sheeruteem" which I think is a request for the
###1111 bathroom. But if you don't know Hebrew
###1115 there's no pauses. And the truth is,
###1117 when you each gave your demonstrations,
###1120 nobody spoke properly because nobody spoke--Here's the
###1124 sentence: "Glorp fendel smug wuggle."
###1127 Rather, you all sounded like, "blublublublublub" without any
###1131 pauses because I don't know your languages.
###1134 Children come into the world without knowing any specific
###1139 language and so they have to learn pauses.
###1143 They have to learn to interpret sounds in context and sometimes
###1148 they make mistakes. They get problems of
###1151 segmentation. And there are some
###1153 illustrations. You could see their mistakes if
###1156 they're trying to repeat back something that's already known
###1159 within a society. So, songs are a good example.
###1162 These are excerpts from children.
###1164 "I'll never be your pizza burnin'."
###1167 Anybody know--figure out what that corresponds to?
###1169 Student: Beast of burden? Professor Paul Bloom:
###1171 "Beast of burden." Very good.
###1173 "A girl with colitis goes by." Somebody?
###1178 Student: "A girl with kaleidoscope eyes."
###1181 Professor Paul Bloom: "The ants are my friends;
###1182 they're blowin' in the wind." And [laughter]
###1188 this is a religious one. "Our father with Bart in heaven;
###1194 Harold be they name… Lead us not into Penn Station…" Now,
###1199 phonological understanding illustrates all sorts of aspects
###1204 of language processing and, in fact, of consciousness.
###1208 Because remember I said that, typically, when you hear a
###1213 sentence you make--you manufacture in your mind gaps
###1217 between the words. Typically, when there's
###1221 something which is unclear you'll fill in the gap and
###1225 figure out what the word is. And you'll hear it that way.
###1229 So, the few examples--The best examples, again,
###1232 are for when it goes wrong. So, a classic example is from
###1237 the song "Super Freak" by Rick James.
###1241 I got a big lecture about copyright laws and this is going
###1246 to violate most of them. Rick James is going to be
###1249 sitting on the--at--staring at the web two years from now
###1251 saying, "Hey. That's my thing."
###1253 Okay. So, I want you to listen to
###1255 this line. I'm sure most of you have heard
###1259 this before but I want you to listen closely.
###1264 What was that last line?
###1266 
###1275 [laughter] "The kind of girl you read
###1277 about--" Well, it turns out that nobody really
###1280 knows. And it sounds to many people
###1283 who do top-down interpretation as--to me as well,
###1288 that "she's the kind of girl you read about in
###1290 Newsweek magazine." But that makes no sense at all
###1294 given that you don't want to "bring home to Mama."
###1299 And she's--and it's not the--and in fact,
###1302 if you check the notes on the song, she's in fact,
###1306 "the kind of girl you read about in new wave magazines."
###1310 Now, when you listen to it then, again, knowing that,
###1317 you hear it that way. Now, this top-down--This is
###1322 known as "top-down" processing. Top-down processing is an
###1326 example of when you know what something is you hear it that
###1332 way. And this is extremely useful
###1336 when it comes to filling in gaps in sounds.
###1341 In normal conversation, if I'm to say "s-- entence" you
###1346 won't hear that as "s-- entence."
###1349 Rather, you hear "sentence." You fill in the gap.
###1352 This can lead to problems. The problem it's led to in my
###1356 life revolves around the song "Get Crunk" [laughter]
###1361 because I've heard "Get Crunk" and my children asked me if I
###1365 would buy them "Get Crunk" from iTunes.
###1369 My children are eight and ten. And now "Get Crunk," as I was
###1373 aware from having heard it before, involves the consistent
###1377 refrain of "get crunk" extremely bad word,
###1380 "get crunk" extremely bad word, and so I said "no."
###1384 And then they said, "Well, there's a clean version
###1386 of it." So, I downloaded the clean
###1389 version. Unfortunately,
###1390 knowing what the clean version--knowing what the word
###1394 is means to me the clean version is not very clean.
###1398 Now, I will add, [laughter]
###1401 before people write letters and stuff, this is the clean
###1408 version. [laughter]
###1411 Thank goodness they took away that obscene word.
###1417 [laughter] Okay. So, top-down processing affects
###1422 how we hear things, usually, almost always,
###1425 for the better. And in fact,
###1427 this is a theme we're going to return to next class when we
###1430 talk about vision because the same thing is going to happen
###1434 there. How we see the world is often
###1437 confusing and befuddled but what we know can clear things up.
###1443 Same with sound.
###1444 
###1448 Morphology is the next level up. Phonology is sounds.
###1451 Morphology is words. And human language uses this
###1456 amazing trick described by Ferdinand de Saussure,
###1459 the great linguist, as "the arbitrariness of the
###1463 sign." And what this means is we can
###1466 use--take any arbitrary idea in the world, the idea of a chair
###1471 or a story or a country, and make a sound or a sign to
###1476 connect to it. And the link is arbitrary.
###1480 You might choose to use a word for "dog" as "woof woof" because
###1484 it sounds like a dog but you can't use a word for "country"
###1489 that sounds like a country. You could use a sign language
###1493 thing for "drink" that looks sort of like the act of drinking
###1496 but you can't use a sign language word for "country" that
###1500 looks like a country, or for "idea" that looks like
###1503 an idea. So, the way languages work is
###1506 it allows for arbitrary naming. It allows for this map between
###1511 a symbol, say a spoken word, and any sort of thought we want
###1517 to use. And those arbitrary mappings,
###1520 as we come to learn them, make up the vocabulary of a
###1525 language. I'm talking about words but the
###1528 more technical term is "morpheme."
###1531 And what a morpheme is is the smallest meaningful unit in a
###1535 language. Now often, this is the same
###1538 thing as a word. So, "dog" is a word.
###1540 And "dog" is also a morpheme, but not always because there
###1543 are single morphemes and then there are words that are
###1546 composed of many morphemes. So, "dogs" and "complained" are
###1551 one word, but two morphemes and what this means is that you make
###1557 the word by putting together two morphemes.
###1561 To put it differently, in order to know what "dogs"
###1564 means, you never had to learn the word "dogs."
###1567 All you had to know is the word "dog" and the plural morpheme
###1571 's' and you could put them together to create a word.
###1575 How many morphemes does the average speaker know?
###1580 The answer is fairly startling. The average speaker knows,
###1585 as a low-ball estimate, about 60,000 words.
###1588 I think the proper estimate is closer to 80,000 or 100,000.
###1594 What this means, if you average it out,
###1597 is that since children start learning their first words at
###1600 about their first year of life, they learn about nine new words
###1604 a day. And it's not a continuous nine
###1609 words every day. It goes up and down depending
###1614 on the age. But still, the amount of words
###1616 we know is staggering. How many of you know more than
###1620 one language pretty fluently? Those of you who know other
###1624 languages might have in your heads 200,000 words or 300,000
###1628 words and you're accessing them in a fraction of a second.
###1632 It is--could legitimately be seen as one of the most
###1638 astonishing things that people do.
###1642 Finally, syntax. So, we have the sound system of
###1646 a language, the phonology. We have the words of a
###1649 language, the morphology, but all that gives you is
###1653 "dog," "cup," "chair," "house," "story," "idea."
###1657 That won't allow us to communicate complicated ideas.
###1661 So, the final step in the story is syntax.
###1665 And syntax refers to those rules and principles that allow
###1669 us to combine words into phrases and phrases into sentences.
###1674 And syntax uses another neat trick and this is defined by
###1679 Wilhelm von Humboldt as the "infinite use of finite media."
###1685 So, here's the question. Your vocabulary is finite.
###1689 There are just so many words. You have to learn them one by
###1692 one, but you could produce a virtual infinity of sentences.
###1696 How can you do that? How can you go from a finite
###1700 list of symbols to an infinite number of sentences?
###1705 And the answer is you have a combinatorial system.
###1710 Now, language is not the only thing in culture or nature that
###1714 has this sort of combinatorial system.
###1717 Music also has a combinatorial system.
###1720 There's a finite number of notes but a limitless number of
###1723 musical compositions. DNA also has this sort of
###1727 combinatorial system where you have a finite number of,
###1733 I guess, bases or amino acids that could combine to a possible
###1737 infinity of strings, of DNA strings.
###1740 
###1743 So, how does this happen? Well, the infinity mechanism,
###1748 and many of you will be familiar with this from
###1751 mathematics or computer science, is recursion.
###1754 And there's a lot to be said about this but it could be
###1757 pretty simply illustrated in language.
###1760 So, here's an example of a simple language.
###1762 It's not--It's actually close to how linguists describe normal
###1767 languages, but it's very simple. It has three nouns,
###1771 "Fred," "Barney" and "Wilma," and two verbs,
###1774 "thinks" and "likes." A very simple language.
###1778 And one rule. And the way to read this rule
###1782 is you make a sentence by taking a noun, any noun,
###1787 putting a verb after it, and then following that verb
###1791 with a noun. Now, when you do this,
###1794 how many--And then so, for instance,
###1797 you get the sentence "Fred likes Wilma."
###1801 When you do this, how many possible sentences are
###1804 there? Let me just take a second.
###1806 Okay. Any guesses?
###1812 Eighteen. The sentences are "Fred likes
###1816 Fred," "Fred likes Barney," "Fred likes Wilma,"
###1819 "Fred thinks Fred," "Fred thinks Barney," "Fred thinks
###1821 Wilma," and so on. The three nouns followed by any
###1825 of the two verbs followed by any of the three nouns.
###1828 That is not a very interesting language.
###1830 But now, take a more complicated language--same
###1834 vocabulary, the same three nouns, the same two verbs,
###1839 the same sentence, but now one other sentence.
###1843 This sentence expands to a noun followed by a verb followed by a
###1848 sentence and there you get recursion.
###1851 You have one rule invoking another rule and then you can
###1857 get a sentence like "Fred thinks Barney likes Wilma."
###1864 And here you get a potential infinity of sentences.
###1869 And this is obviously a toy example but you could see the
###1874 use of recursion in everyday life and in everyday use of
###1879 language. You could say,
###1881 "John hates cheese," "My roommate heard a rumor that John
###1884 hates cheese," "It disturbed Mary when I told
###1886 her that my roommate heard a rumor that John hates cheese,"
###1889 "I was amazed that it disturbed Mary when I told her that my
###1891 roommate heard a rumor that John hates cheese,"
###1893 "Professor Bloom had devoted way too much of his lecture
###1894 talking about how I was amazed [laughter]
###1896 that it disturbed Mary when I told her that my roommate heard
###1898 a rumor that John hates cheese," "It really bothered me that--"
###1902 and there's no limit. There's no longest sentence.
###1906 You could keep producing a sentence deeper and deeper
###1909 embedded until you die. And this is part of the power
###1912 of language. Now, the syntactic rules are
###1916 complicated. And one of the puzzles of
###1919 syntactic rules, or one of the issues of them,
###1922 is that different rules can conspire to create the same
###1926 sentence. So, you take a sentence
###1928 like--This is a classic line from Groucho Marx:
###1932 "I once shot an elephant in my pajamas.
###1935 How it got into my pajamas I'll never know."
###1937 And the humor, such that it is,
###1940 revolves around the ambiguity of rules that generate it,
###1944 like this versus like this. Often, to illustrate the issues
###1949 of ambiguity, people have collected poorly
###1953 thought-out headlines in newspaper reports that play
###1958 on--that inadvertently have ambiguity.
###1962 "Complaints about NBA referees growing ugly."
###1965 So, that's the beauty of that structure.
###1968 "Kids make nutritious snacks." "No one was injured in a blast
###1974 which was attributed to the buildup of gas by one town
###1978 official." Last summer I was in Seoul
###1981 visiting the--visiting Korea University and the big headline
###1987 there on the front page was "General arrested for fondling
###1993 privates." [laughter]
###1995 Now, there actually is--The ambiguity is actually quite
###2000 difficult to avoid in the construction and understanding
###2004 of sentences. It's one of the ways in which
###2008 it's often difficult to write clearly, and in fact,
###2011 there's a whole sub-field of the law involving the use of
###2016 linguistic theory to disambiguate sentences both in
###2020 the Constitution, in legislation,
###2024 as well as in some criminal cases.
###2028 And there was, several years ago,
###2031 a very serious criminal case that rested on a sentence.
###2037 And here's what happened. There were two brothers,
###2040 one of them retarded, and they get into a robbery.
###2043 And a police officer sees them and points the gun at them.
###2049 And one of the brothers points a gun at the police officer.
###2055 The police officer shouts for the brother, the non-retarded
###2059 brother, to drop the gun. Actually, he said,
###2063 "Give me the gun." The retarded brother shouted,
###2067 "Let him have it," whereupon the brother shot and killed the
###2072 police officer. Now, the brother who did the
###2075 shooting was plainly a murderer. What about that brother who
###2079 shouted, "Let him have it"? Well, it depends on what he--on
###2083 how you interpret that sentence because the sentence is
###2087 beautifully ambiguous. It could mean "shoot him,
###2092 let him have it," or it could mean "give him the gun,
###2096 let him have it." And in fact,
###2099 the trial, which I think somebody could--If people out
###2101 there know about this, please send me an e-mail.
###2104 My understanding was he was found guilty but a lot to turn
###2108 on the ambiguity of a sentence. I want to shift now and talk
###2113 about where does all this knowledge come from but I'll
###2117 stop and answer any questions about the material so far.
###2122 What are your questions? Yes.
###2124 Student: How does syntax differ from grammar or are they
###2127 exactly the same? Professor Paul Bloom:
###2129 Syntax--The question is, "How is syntax different from
###2130 grammar?" They're exactly the same.
###2133 Syntax is a more technical term but it means the same thing as
###2139 grammar. Yes.
###2141 Student: You said that every normal human being that's
###2144 born uses at some point or another some kind of language.
###2147 Aren't there people who weren't born within a culture and grew
###2152 up and who never really spoke a language though they were
###2157 physically normal? Professor Paul Bloom:
###2159 Yes. I'm glad you actually asked me
###2161 about that because, as I said it,
###2162 I realized it wasn't quite right.
###2164 The point that was just raised here is I had said before that
###2167 everybody who's neurologically normal comes to acquire and
###2171 learn a language. But what about people who are
###2174 neurologically normal but they don't have language around them?
###2178 And in fact, there have been,
###2180 historically, some cases of this.
###2182 There's been, probably apocryphal,
###2184 stories about children who are raised by wolves or by dogs.
###2189 There are stories, horrible stories,
###2191 some in the twentieth century, about children who are locked
###2195 away by insane or evil parents and have never learned to speak.
###2200 There are stories of deaf people who are within certain
###2203 societies where nobody signs to them, and so they're what's
###2207 known as linguistic isolates. And they themselves never learn
###2210 to speak. And those cases are the
###2213 dramatic exception and they do tell you something.
###2217 They tell you that it's not enough to have a brain for
###2219 language. Somebody does have to use it
###2222 with you. Interestingly,
###2224 it doesn't have to be that many people.
###2227 So, Susan Goldin-Meadow has studied deaf children that
###2231 nobody signed to but what she studies is deaf children with
###2235 deaf siblings and these children don't just sit there.
###2239 They create their own language. It's not a full-blown language
###2243 like American sign-language or langue des signes
###2245 quebecoise but it's a language nonetheless,
###2248 with words and syntax and phonology.
###2251 It's an interesting question. Any other questions?
###2259 Yes. Student: Could it be
###2266 argued that there are inherent limits to grammar?
###2276 Professor Paul Bloom: It's a good question.
###2278 The question is, "Are there inherent limits in
###2280 our abilities to come up with grammars?"
###2283 And most linguists would argue "yes," that languages are highly
###2287 constrained in how they do things.
###2289 So, for instance, one example is there's no
###2292 language in the world that ever constructs a question by
###2297 switching the order of words around in a sentence.
###2301 There's no language in the world that has a rule that says
###2305 the fifth word has to be a verb. And linguists have all of these
###2309 conditions they say, "no language in the world works
###2311 this way." Now this is--;So,
###2313 these are constraints on grammar and they're really
###2316 interesting because they tell us what's a humanly natural
###2319 language versus what's not a humanly natural language.
###2323 But notice, even if there is incredible constraints on
###2326 grammars, still--we could still produce an infinite number of
###2330 sentences. It's just like if you restrict
###2333 me to only a subset of numbers, only the odd numbers,
###2337 still there's an infinity of odd numbers.
###2340 So, grammar can be restricted but still give rise to an
###2347 infinity of possible sentences. Well, there's a radical claim
###2353 about the origin of language associated with the guy who we
###2357 met when we talked about behaviorism who wrote A
###2360 Review of Verbal Behavior,  the linguist Noam Chomsky.
###2364 And Chomsky makes this radical claim.
###2368 And this is that we shouldn't view language learning as
###2371 learning at all. Instead, we should view it as
###2374 something similar to growth. So he says,
###2377 No one would take seriously the proposal that a
###2379 human organism learns through experience to have arms rather
###2382 than wings, or that the basic structure of
###2385 particular organs results from accidental experience.
###2387 [Language] proves to be no less marvelous
###2389 and intricate than these physical structures.
###2391 Why, then, should we not study the acquisition of a cognitive
###2395 structure like language more or less as we study some complex
###2398 bodily organ? So, you might learn to play
###2401 baseball, you might learn about the American Civil War,
###2405 but if Chomsky is right you didn't learn to speak English.
###2409 Rather, what happened is you heard English and--but the
###2412 capacity grew in your head and something a lot more similar to
###2417 the development of arms or legs or a visual system.
###2420 Well, should we believe this? We know there has to be some
###2425 effect of the environment shaping language,
###2428 obviously, because in order to know
###2431 English you have to have heard English, in order to know Dutch
###2434 you have had to heard, to--had to have learned and
###2437 heard Dutch. And in fact,
###2439 languages differ in all the ways that we were talking about.
###2442 Some languages like English has a--have a distinction between
###2446 ‘l' and ‘r.' Other languages do not.
###2449 For a language like English, that creature there is referred
###2453 to with the morpheme "dog." That's a historical accident of
###2457 English. In French it's chien and
###2461 in Greek it's something else. And each of those 6,000
###2466 languages and people in the room who know another language would
###2469 say, "Yeah, in Vietnamese it's
###2471 this," "In Urdu it's this," "In Czech it's that."
###2474 Finally, there is syntax. So, English is what's known as
###2479 a subject-verb-object language. That means if you want to
###2484 convey the idea that Bill hit John, you would say,
###2488 "Bill hit John." But not all languages work that
###2492 way. In fact, the majority of
###2494 languages, more languages, are actually
###2496 subject-object-verb languages. So, you would say,
###2500 if you wanted to convey that Bill was the hitter and John was
###2504 hit, "Bill John hit." All of this has to be learned.
###2508 And all of this has to be learned through exposure to
###2511 language users. On the other hand,
###2514 there is considerable evidence that the development of these
###2519 language skills, in some way,
###2522 is similar to growth in the way that Chomsky suggests.
###2529 So, here are some basic facts about language development.
###2532 One is something which I had mentioned before.
###2535 All normal children learn language.
###2541 There can be specific impairments of language.
###2545 Now, again, we spoke about them before when talking about the
###2548 brain. Some of these impairments could
###2550 be due to trauma, the aphasias.
###2553 Trauma, a blow to the head, a stroke can rid you of your
###2558 language. But, also, there are genetic
###2560 disorders, some falling under the rubric of what's known as
###2564 "specific language impairment," where children are born without
###2569 the same ability as the rest of us to learn to speak.
###2575 And these are interesting in many ways.
###2578 One reason that they're interesting is that they
###2581 illustrate something about human language.
###2584 It is not--It would not be unreasonable for you to think
###2588 before listening to his lecture, "Look.
###2590 All you need to have to learn a language is to be smart" or "All
###2594 you need to have to learn a language is to want to
###2598 communicate" or "All you need to have to learn a language is to
###2602 be a social person wanting to--having the ability to
###2605 understand others and deal with others."
###2608 But the cases of specific language impairments suggest
###2612 that all of that is wrong, because there are children in
###2616 this world right now who are plenty smart,
###2619 who really want to communicate, and who are entirely social
###2624 creatures but they can't learn language.
###2628 And this suggests that the ability to learn language and
###2632 understand language is to some extent separate from these other
###2636 aspects of mental life. Continuing on this theme,
###2640 we also know that language is learnt without any sort of
###2645 feedback or training. There are many Americans who
###2648 believe that they need to teach their children language.
###2652 And there's a huge industry with DVDs and flash cards and
###2656 all sorts of things designed to teach your children language.
###2659 And I think many parents believe that if they didn't
###2662 persist in using these things their children would never learn
###2665 to speak. But we know that that's not
###2668 true. We know that this isn't true
###2670 because there are communities where they don't speak to their
###2675 kids. They don't speak to their kids
###2677 because they don't believe it's important to speak to their
###2680 kids. Some linguists would
###2682 interview--Linguists would interview adults in these
###2685 communities and say, "Why don't you speak to your
###2688 babies?" And these adults would respond,
###2691 "It'd be ridiculous to speak to a baby.
###2694 The baby has nothing to say. You might as well just speak to
###2698 your dog." And then the American linguist
###2700 would say, "Yeah. We speak to our dogs."
###2705 [laughter] Americans and Europeans speak
###2707 to everything and everybody. Other cultures are more picky
###2710 and they don't talk to their children until their children
###2714 themselves are talking. This doesn't seem to make much
###2717 of a difference in language learning.
###2720 Some studies have, motivated by Chomsky's work in
###2724 expressed--sorry, motivated by Chomsky's critique
###2728 of Skinner's Verbal Behavior,  have asked even in-- "What
###2733 if we just looked at children within the United States?
###2736 Don't these children get feedback?"
###2739 And the answer is yes and no. So your average highly educated
###2745 Western parent does give their children feedback--do give their
###2750 children feedback based on what they say.
###2753 But they don't typically give feedback based on the syntax or
###2758 grammaticality of what they say. The example given by Brown and
###2763 Hanlon in the classic study in the 1970s is they did all of
###2767 these studies looking at what children say and how parents
###2770 responded, and it turns out parents
###2773 respond not to the grammatical correctness but to the affect or
###2779 cuteness or sociability of the utterance.
###2783 So for instance, if a child says to his mother,
###2786 "I loves you, Mommy," it's a very unusual
###2788 parent who would say, "Oh, no.
###2790 The verb agreement is mistaken. [laughter]
###2794 You've added a redundant ‘s.' It's not appropriate."
###2798 Similarly, if a child is to say, "I hate your guts,
###2802 Mother," it's an unusual mother, "That's wonderful.
###2805 There's a subject, verb, object. The whole thing's structurally
###2808 fine." We respond to our kids like we
###2811 respond to each other based on the message that's conveyed,
###2814 not the grammaticality of the utterances.
###2816 Children make grammatical mistakes all the time but then
###2820 they go away and they go away without correction.
###2824 So those are some basic facts. What do we know about the time
###2829 course of language? Well, early on children start
###2833 off and they prefer the melody of their own language.
###2838 These studies were done in France with four-day-old babies.
###2843 And what they did was they used a sucking method.
###2846 Remember, there's a limited number of things babies can do.
###2848 One of the things they can do is suck, and these babies would
###2852 suck on a pacifier to hear French.
###2854 And they would prefer to hear French than to hear Russian.
###2861 And these investigators claimed this is because they had been
###2865 exposed to French in the first four days of their lives.
###2869 Reviewers, mostly from France, objected and said,
###2873 "No. Maybe French just sounds better.
###2875 Everybody's going to like French."
###2877 So, they re-did the study in Russia.
###2880 Russian kids sucked harder to hear Russian than they did to
###2883 French. And what they're listening to
###2886 isn't the words. They don't know words yet.
###2888 They don't know of syntax yet. It's the rhythm of the language.
###2891 For you, French and Russian sound different.
###2894 Even if you're like me and you don't know a word of either
###2897 language, they still sound different.
###2898 They sound different to babies too.
###2902 And a baby being raised in France or a baby being raised in
###2907 Russia knows enough to tell what's his language and what
###2912 isn't. Early on, children are
###2915 sensitive to every phoneme there is.
###2920 So, English-speaking children, for instance,
###2922 can--English-speaking babies – babies who are born in the
###2926 United States – can distinguish between English
###2929 phonemes like "lip" and "rip" but they could also distinguish
###2933 between phonemic contrasts that are not exemplified in English,
###2938 such as phonemic contrasts in Czech or Hindi.
###2940 Yes. Student:
###2942 I'm wondering if you can say the wrong things to them--to
###2946 infants based on what you were saying before.
###2949 Because I was in France one summer and I had some neighbors
###2951 there. I hated these neighbors,
###2953 I thought they were stupid. Not because they were French,
###2958 but they had a baby and it would gaggle and coo and they
###2965 would respond in similar terms. Professor Paul Bloom:
###2970 They would gaggle and coo back at the baby.
###2971 Student: [inaudible] And I hate these people.
###2974 [inaudible] So I don't know if it--Does it
###2980 matter what you say to babies as long as you say something.
###2990 Professor Paul Bloom: There's a lot going on in your
###2994 question. [laughter]
###2995 Some raising--Well, there's a lot going on in your
###2997 question. The answer to the question--
###3000 The question was, "your baby's going to coo and
###3003 'ga ga, goo goo,' does it matter if you coo and 'ga ga,
###3006 goo goo' back?" No, it doesn't make a
###3008 difference. Your hatred towards them was
###3011 unmotivated. You can be relieved of that
###3015 debt, or now you know you feel bad now, I guess.
###3018 [laughter] If you speak to your children
###3022 in perfect English, it's very strange.
###3025 Nobody speaks to their babies in, "Hello, Son.
###3028 It's time--Oh. You want to change your diaper
###3031 right now so stay still." That's bad parenting.
###3034 It sounds kind of silly. More--What most people do is,
###3036 "Oh. You're such a cute little baby."
###3038 And it probably--One--T here's--Evolutionary
###3041 psychologists debate the function of why we talk funny to
###3046 babies. And some people have argued
###3048 that it does help their language learning.
###3051 And some people have argued instead that what it does is it
###3055 calms them. They like to hear the music of
###3057 a smooth voice and so on. But whether or not you do so
###3061 doesn't seem to make a big difference.
###3063 It is very difficult to find any effect of how parents talk
###3067 to their kids on how their kids learn language,
###3070 particularly when it comes to babies.
###3073 So, early on babies can--are sensitive to all phonemes and
###3079 then that goes away. Around twelve months of age it
###3083 goes away. This is one thing you were much
###3086 better at when you were a baby than you are now.
###3089 When you were a baby you were a multilingual fool.
###3093 You could understand the sound differences of every language on
###3098 earth. Now, if you're like me,
###3101 you could barely understand English.
###3103 [laughter] You narrow down until you're
###3106 sensitive just to the language you hear.
###3109 And this narrowing down is largely in place by about twelve
###3115 months of age. Around seven months is babbling.
###3119 And I want to stop at this point to go back to the issue--I
###3124 promised you I would turn a bit to sign language and I want to
###3129 describe now a very elegant--I want to show a little film now
###3134 of a very elegant series of experiments looking at the
###3138 question of whether babies who are exposed to a sign language,
###3143 babble. One of the real surprising
###3146 findings in my field over the last ten/twenty years has been
###3151 that the acquisition of sign languages has turned out to be
###3156 almost exactly the same; in fact, as far as we know,
###3160 exactly the same as the acquisition of spoken languages.
###3163 It didn't have to be that way. It could have been just as
###3166 reasonable to expect that there'd be an advantage for
###3170 speech over sign. That sign languages may be
###3173 full-blown languages but they just take--they're just harder
###3176 to learn because the brain and the body have adapted for
###3180 speech. It turns out that this just
###3182 isn't the case. It turns out that sign and--the
###3185 developmental milestones of sign languages and the developmental
###3189 milestones of spoken languages are precisely the same.
###3192 They start babbling at the same point.
###3194 They start using first words, first sentences,
###3197 first complicated constructions.
###3199 There seems to be no interesting difference between
###3203 how the brain comes to acquire and use the spoken language
###3207 versus a sign language. Around twelve months of age,
###3211 children start using their first words.
###3215 These are words for objects and actions like "dog" and "up" and
###3221 "milk." They start showing some
###3224 sensitivity to the order of words.
###3227 So they know that "dog bites cat" is different from "cat
###3233 bites dog." Around eighteen months of age,
###3236 they start learning words faster.
###3238 They start producing little, miniature sentences like "Want
###3242 cookie" or "Milk spill" and the function morphemes,
###3247 the little words, "in," "of," "a," "the," and so
###3250 on start to gradually appear.
###3252 
###3255 Then the--Then there's the bad news.
###3257 Around seven years of age going up through puberty,
###3262 the ability to learn language starts to go away.
###3266 The best work on this has been done by Elissa Newport and Sam
###3271 Supalla who have studied people who have been in the United
###3276 States for many, many years – 30,40 years –
###3280 and seeing how well they have come to speak English.
###3284 And it turns out the big determinant of how well you
###3287 speak English as an immigrant isn't how smart you are.
###3290 It's not how many family members you have when you're
###3293 here. It's not your motivation.
###3295 It's how old you were when you started.
###3298 It turns out that if you start learning a language – a second
###3302 language is where most of the work's been done – within the
###3306 first few years of life you're fine.
###3308 You'll speak like a native. But then it starts getting
###3313 worse and worse. And once you hit puberty,
###3316 suddenly there's huge variation in the abilities you have to
###3320 learn language. It is very rare,
###3322 for instance, for somebody who has learned
###3325 English past puberty to speak without an accent.
###3328 An accent is very hard to shake and it's not just an accent.
###3331 It's also other aspects of phonology, syntax,
###3335 and morphology. It's like the part of the brain
###3339 that's responsible for language learning is only around early in
###3344 development and if you don't get your language by then it'll just
###3348 run out. I want to begin next class with
###3353 this question, the question of animals.
###3358 And that will shut down the language learning part.
###3361 But one thing I'll put up here is your second reading response.
###3370 So, I'll also put this up on Wednesday, and by Wednesday you
