0:0:4,0 --> 0:0:8,79
So I've got the most beautiful chicken and
mushroom pie. Absolute comfort food. With


2
0:0:8,79 --> 0:0:14,26
a little bit of spring onion and mustard.
Delicious!


3
0:0:14,26 --> 0:0:21,519
Get yourself a little knife. So these chicken
breasts here, I'm gonna slice these into centimetre


4
0:0:21,519 --> 0:0:28,419
slices. I've got a little enamel metal tin.
Whack it on to a high a heat. Couple of lugs


5
0:0:28,419 --> 0:0:33,58
of olive oil in there. Get your chicken, put
it into your olive oil. Of course we wanna


6
0:0:33,58 --> 0:0:40,57
hit that with some sea salt, little bit of
cracked black pepper. Knob of butter in the


7
0:0:40,57 --> 0:0:47,49
chicken. I've got some spring onions here.
Slice up the spring onions as best as you


8
0:0:47,49 --> 0:0:52,62
can. I'm not bothered. You know the great
thing about these 30 minute meals recipes


9
0:0:52,62 --> 0:0:59,24
- if you're rubbish with a knife, it's alright,
if you're brilliant, it's alright. It don't


10
0:0:59,24 --> 0:1:2,87
matter. Get yourself a little box grater,
the fine attachment on one of these little


11
0:1:2,87 --> 0:1:9,96
graters and you just want, you know, quarter
of a nutmeg. One or two bay leaves. Just gonna


12
0:1:9,96 --> 0:1:15,69
tear the stalk of these bay leaves and a little
bit of thyme. And then we want mushrooms.


13
0:1:15,69 --> 0:1:22,99
I've got about 150 grams or a kinda big handful
of button mushrooms. You know, pick these


14
0:1:22,99 --> 0:1:31,9
bad boys up. Get a slicer attachment on your
processor and put them in.


15
0:1:31,9 --> 0:1:32,53
Do you know what I mean?


16
0:1:32,53 --> 0:1:39,729
So, mushrooms go in. I'm gonna now
turn this into like a pie filling. One heaped


17
0:1:39,729 --> 0:1:46,34
tablespoon on crÃ¨me fraiche. In at this point
is a heaped teaspoon of flour and then attitude,


18
0:1:46,34 --> 0:1:51,729
a heaped teaspoon of mustard. And then one
of these little tubs of pre-done chicken stock


19
0:1:51,729 --> 0:1:55,549
if you haven't got any of your own of course.
Or a stock cube and a bit of water. This is


20
0:1:55,549 --> 0:2:3,9
about 300ml of stock and we just mix it up.
And you've already got a beautiful, creamy


21
0:2:3,9 --> 0:2:9,259
sauce. So, I'm gonna turn it down to low because
I've got no rush now, I'm happy. Some puff


22
0:2:9,259 --> 0:2:14,89
pastry. Buy it pre-done and then you just
put that pastry on here. And tuck it into


23
0:2:14,89 --> 0:2:19,78
bed and fold the pastry sort of back in on
itself. I want it to glaze and look beautiful


24
0:2:19,78 --> 0:2:27,44
so you can use milk or one egg. Just lightly
brush this pastry on top. All looks very nice!


25
0:2:27,44 --> 0:2:33,12
Let's get a bit of rosemary, stick it right
in there. Right, in the oven that is cooked


26
0:2:33,12 --> 0:2:35,5
when it looks cooked.


27
0:2:35,5 --> 0:2:43,94
The pie I can see is done. Let's just move that over. Look at that.


28
0:2:43,94 --> 0:4:43,94
Beautiful! I want that for dinner.
