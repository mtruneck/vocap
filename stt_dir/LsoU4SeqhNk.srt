0:0:45,767 --> 0:0:48,4
>> Dr. Wafeek Wahby:
Well, before we start, I want to


3
0:0:48,4 --> 0:0:51,8
tell you we are taping so we
can capture Marty McIntyre's


4
0:0:51,8 --> 0:0:55,5
presentation for any of you or
for anybody else who missed


5
0:0:55,5 --> 0:0:59,67
this class so we can have it
on DVD if anybody would like


6
0:0:59,67 --> 0:1:1,733
to have it, and leave it
in the library as well.


7
0:1:1,733 --> 0:1:6,467
So, now we start officially,
it's 5 o'clock, so good evening,


8
0:1:6,467 --> 0:1:8,0
or good afternoon if you like.


9
0:1:8,0 --> 0:1:12,0
My name is Wafeek Wahby, and
I am thankful to Dr. Mori Toosi


10
0:1:12,0 --> 0:1:15,6
to give us his class,
your students.


11
0:1:15,6 --> 0:1:18,667
And let me see by a show of
hands how many of you have been


12
0:1:18,667 --> 0:1:22,8
to Marty McIntyre's
class last week.


13
0:1:22,8 --> 0:1:24,133
Okay, very good.


14
0:1:24,133 --> 0:1:25,5
>> Ms. Marty McIntyre:
Or last year.


15
0:1:25,5 --> 0:1:26,933
>> Dr. Wahby:
Last year, last year, very good.


16
0:1:26,933 --> 0:1:30,0
How many of you have been to
the plant in Alsip in Chicago?


17
0:1:30,0 --> 0:1:32,167
Very good, okay.


18
0:1:32,167 --> 0:1:34,467
Now the plan would be like this.


19
0:1:34,467 --> 0:1:36,433
Today we will get the
theoretical background and


20
0:1:36,433 --> 0:1:39,333
the fun here on the screen and
from Marty, and then on the


21
0:1:39,333 --> 0:1:43,5
15th of October we will take
two vans or three vans and go


22
0:1:43,5 --> 0:1:47,233
and visit the plant, and we
will talk about this later


23
0:1:47,233 --> 0:1:49,467
and Dr. Toosi will
give you the details.


24
0:1:49,467 --> 0:1:52,767
So we can see how things
are done in the plant,


25
0:1:52,767 --> 0:1:54,933
and maybe we can
visit some projects.


26
0:1:54,933 --> 0:1:57,433
So without much ado,
Marty McIntyre, and


27
0:1:57,433 --> 0:1:59,33
she will introduce herself.


28
0:1:59,33 --> 0:2:1,333
>> Ms. McIntyre:
Okay, hi.


29
0:2:1,333 --> 0:2:4,333
I thought I recognized a
couple of you from last year,


30
0:2:4,333 --> 0:2:8,1
but I work with PCI,
which is the Precast


31
0:2:8,1 --> 0:2:11,0
Prestressed Concrete Institute.


32
0:2:11,0 --> 0:2:16,267
It's kind of a combination of a
trade association, so we have


33
0:2:16,267 --> 0:2:22,567
about 235 member companies who
manufacture precast products.


34
0:2:22,567 --> 0:2:26,667
Anything from bridge beams,
hollowcore, double tees, any of


35
0:2:26,667 --> 0:2:30,333
the large structural type pieces
of concrete that you would see


36
0:2:30,333 --> 0:2:32,633
coming to a job site
on a truck.


37
0:2:32,633 --> 0:2:37,67
So no small lentils and
nothing that goes underground.


38
0:2:37,67 --> 0:2:41,5
We're also an institute, which
means we do a lot of work with


39
0:2:41,5 --> 0:2:49,567
universities doing research,
product development, and kind of


40
0:2:49,567 --> 0:2:55,333
state-of-the-industry work to
kind of keep things up to speed.


41
0:2:55,333 --> 0:2:59,533
So this is going to be a review
for some of you who have seen


42
0:2:59,533 --> 0:3:2,467
this already, but I just have a
little bit of information for


43
0:3:2,467 --> 0:3:7,0
you that gives you kind of a
nice introduction to Precast.


44
0:3:7,0 --> 0:3:11,2
We're going to talk a little
bit about what are the products


45
0:3:11,2 --> 0:3:13,633
that are manufactured,
where are they used, and


46
0:3:13,633 --> 0:3:16,7
how are they manufactured.


47
0:3:16,7 --> 0:3:20,67
So feel free to stop me at any
point if you have any questions


48
0:3:20,67 --> 0:3:24,433
and I'd be happy to answer your
questions for you.


49
0:3:24,433 --> 0:3:27,1
I always think when I'm
starting to talk about precast


50
0:3:27,1 --> 0:3:31,33
that in some ways it's kind
of fun to look at kind of


51
0:3:31,33 --> 0:3:35,367
the biggest or the best or the
most interesting projects


52
0:3:35,367 --> 0:3:37,0
that have been done.


53
0:3:37,0 --> 0:3:40,667
So over the last year I kind of
put together, this is my own


54
0:3:40,667 --> 0:3:44,0
personal list of what I call the
"Seven Wonders of Precast",


55
0:3:44,0 --> 0:3:45,833
some of the projects that
I think are some of the


56
0:3:45,833 --> 0:3:49,733
coolest precast projects
that are out there.


57
0:3:49,733 --> 0:3:53,5
And that's kind of a nice way
for me to get started.


58
0:3:53,5 --> 0:3:55,933
So you can see that they're all
over the world, but of course


59
0:3:55,933 --> 0:3:58,767
I know more projects in the
US than anywhere else,


60
0:3:58,767 --> 0:4:2,967
so a lot of them are right
here in our own back door.


61
0:4:2,967 --> 0:4:7,733
Oops, oh, it didn't like getting
transferred, I apologize.


62
0:4:7,733 --> 0:4:11,6
So this is supposed to show
you the Bahai Temple.


63
0:4:11,6 --> 0:4:14,7
I can show you another
picture of it, it's up


64
0:4:14,7 --> 0:4:16,467
here in the corner.


65
0:4:16,467 --> 0:4:21,633
Sorry about that, I don't know
why it didn't transfer.


66
0:4:21,633 --> 0:4:26,6
So the Bahai Temple is in
Glencoe, Illinois, up north of


67
0:4:26,6 --> 0:4:31,933
Chicago, kind of near the
lakefront on Lake Michigan.


68
0:4:31,933 --> 0:4:36,267
And it was actually done in
the 1920s through the 1930s,


69
0:4:36,267 --> 0:4:38,67
it took quite a while to build.


70
0:4:38,67 --> 0:4:41,8
And the entire skin of it is
actually architectural precast.


71
0:4:41,8 --> 0:4:44,967
It was manufactured in
New York and then shipped,


72
0:4:44,967 --> 0:4:48,533
piece by piece, to Glencoe.


73
0:4:48,533 --> 0:4:52,733
And you can see on the dome and
in some of the other areas,


74
0:4:52,733 --> 0:4:54,9
and if you could see the
pictures that I had put on my


75
0:4:54,9 --> 0:4:58,167
slide you'd be able to see that,
some of the intricate detail


76
0:4:58,167 --> 0:5:2,633
that you can actually get out
of architectural Precast.


77
0:5:2,633 --> 0:5:5,833
Then those are all put together
and it can really withstand the


78
0:5:5,833 --> 0:5:10,9
test of time, so it does
a nice job doing that.


79
0:5:10,9 --> 0:5:13,933
In some ways
manufacturing--yes?


80
0:5:13,933 --> 0:5:15,167
>> Dr. Wahby:
Would you please give us


81
0:5:15,167 --> 0:5:18,67
your definition of precast?


82
0:5:18,67 --> 0:5:20,767
>> Ms. McIntyre:
The definition of precast?


83
0:5:20,767 --> 0:5:22,3
>> Dr. Wahby:
What precast means.


84
0:5:22,3 --> 0:5:24,5
>> Ms. McIntyre:
You know, precast is anything


85
0:5:24,5 --> 0:5:28,0
that's cast in a plant and then
brought to the site.


86
0:5:28,0 --> 0:5:33,167
So it's cast out of concrete,
and usually it's manufactured


87
0:5:33,167 --> 0:5:35,3
in some kind of formwork.


88
0:5:35,3 --> 0:5:39,233
In the case of the Bahai Temple,
it's specially designed formwork


89
0:5:39,233 --> 0:5:41,9
with all of those
intricate details.


90
0:5:41,9 --> 0:5:45,667
Actually, all of these would
be specialty things.


91
0:5:45,667 --> 0:5:50,3
But it can also be kind of
more mundane--double T's,


92
0:5:50,3 --> 0:5:53,533
hollow core, different pieces
like that, that are cast


93
0:5:53,533 --> 0:5:57,567
in steel beds where you repeat
the same pattern or the


94
0:5:57,567 --> 0:6:0,233
same piece over and
over again.


95
0:6:0,233 --> 0:6:3,667
So precast is really
manufactured at the plant


96
0:6:3,667 --> 0:6:7,767
and then brought
to the job site.


97
0:6:7,767 --> 0:6:10,833
So, in some ways, with
architectural precast and


98
0:6:10,833 --> 0:6:13,333
what happened with the
Bahai Temple, precast has


99
0:6:13,333 --> 0:6:15,333
not changed a whole lot.


100
0:6:15,333 --> 0:6:19,0
If you had a client who was
willing to pay that much money,


101
0:6:19,0 --> 0:6:21,933
put that much money into it,
you could still get that kind


102
0:6:21,933 --> 0:6:25,433
of architectural precast and
that same level of detail.


103
0:6:25,433 --> 0:6:28,433
I don't see a whole lot of
clients looking for that,


104
0:6:28,433 --> 0:6:30,167
but that could happen.


105
0:6:30,167 --> 0:6:32,433
The things that have really
changed in our industry since


106
0:6:32,433 --> 0:6:36,467
that was done in the 1920s
and 1930s was really the


107
0:6:36,467 --> 0:6:39,467
quality of the concrete
that's being used.


108
0:6:39,467 --> 0:6:42,567
There's add mixtures
now that allow a much


109
0:6:42,567 --> 0:6:46,67
higher strength
concrete to be used.


110
0:6:46,67 --> 0:6:49,0
There's self-compacting
concrete, which allows the


111
0:6:49,0 --> 0:6:53,233
concrete to flow and get into
a lot of nooks and crannies


112
0:6:53,233 --> 0:6:56,4
a little bit better, and
just the whole idea of


113
0:6:56,4 --> 0:6:58,333
repetition in the industry.


114
0:6:58,333 --> 0:7:1,867
That's one of the first examples
of architectural precast.


115
0:7:1,867 --> 0:7:8,867
And now, you know, 50, 75 years
later it's become an industry


116
0:7:8,867 --> 0:7:11,9
and, you know, it's just a
much more common product


117
0:7:11,9 --> 0:7:15,3
than it was then.


118
0:7:15,3 --> 0:7:20,967
I don't know why it doesn't
like my pictures.


119
0:7:20,967 --> 0:7:30,667
The second project that I like
to talk about is the Chunnel.


120
0:7:30,667 --> 0:7:35,833
In a lot of ways this is
just as interesting.


121
0:7:35,833 --> 0:7:39,4
It might not be as beautiful to
look at as the Bahai Temple,


122
0:7:39,4 --> 0:7:43,1
but just the scope of the
project and the magnitude


123
0:7:43,1 --> 0:7:45,4
of what they were able
to do with the precast


124
0:7:45,4 --> 0:7:47,567
is really remarkable.


125
0:7:47,567 --> 0:7:51,633
The entire tunnel, or Chunnel,
underneath the English Channel


126
0:7:51,633 --> 0:7:53,867
is lined in precast.


127
0:7:53,867 --> 0:7:56,567
And they actually had to use
two different designs for the


128
0:7:56,567 --> 0:7:59,4
precast on the two different
sides of the Chunnel


129
0:7:59,4 --> 0:8:1,533
because of the soil conditions.


130
0:8:1,533 --> 0:8:3,9
And so they really had to look
at the soil conditions and


131
0:8:3,9 --> 0:8:6,367
design the precast around it.


132
0:8:6,367 --> 0:8:12,167
So all of the liner components,
they've augured all of the dirt


133
0:8:12,167 --> 0:8:16,667
out of it and then placed the
liners in there and created the


134
0:8:16,667 --> 0:8:20,67
Chunnel underneath the Channel.


135
0:8:20,67 --> 0:8:23,2
So the Sunshine Skyway Bridge
is kind of interesting because


136
0:8:23,2 --> 0:8:28,67
it's a five-mile-long bridge,
and it was really an


137
0:8:28,67 --> 0:8:30,767
engineering feat that kind of
combines the two things that


138
0:8:30,767 --> 0:8:32,8
we were looking at earlier.


139
0:8:32,8 --> 0:8:37,533
It's the engineering of the
Chunnel and the magnitude of


140
0:8:37,533 --> 0:8:41,2
that project, but it's got some
of the same beauty, I think,


141
0:8:41,2 --> 0:8:43,7
that the Bahai Temple has.


142
0:8:43,7 --> 0:8:47,533
It really was able to kind of
take the product and use it


143
0:8:47,533 --> 0:8:52,0
in a very organic way to make
it beautiful and functional


144
0:8:52,0 --> 0:8:54,0
at the same time.


145
0:8:54,0 --> 0:8:58,0
So that was done in the 1980s,
and at that time it was the


146
0:8:58,0 --> 0:9:3,8
longest bridge and the
first of its type.


147
0:9:3,8 --> 0:9:6,367
The Jubilee Church is in Rome.


148
0:9:6,367 --> 0:9:9,867
Richard Meier was the
architect, he is actually


149
0:9:9,867 --> 0:9:11,733
a New York architect.


150
0:9:11,733 --> 0:9:16,567
This is a Catholic church in
Rome, and Richard Meier loves


151
0:9:16,567 --> 0:9:21,133
very bright white,
clean spaces.


152
0:9:21,133 --> 0:9:27,167
And the Jubilee Church really
reflects his love of that kind


153
0:9:27,167 --> 0:9:30,333
of starkness and the whiteness.


154
0:9:30,333 --> 0:9:33,967
The interesting thing about it,
I think, is really where you are


155
0:9:33,967 --> 0:9:38,833
able to take the precast and
use it as a curved product, a


156
0:9:38,833 --> 0:9:43,133
molded product, a
very flowable look.


157
0:9:43,133 --> 0:9:45,667
Unfortunately, you can't see
the picture of the inside of


158
0:9:45,667 --> 0:9:48,0
the church, but the inside
of the church is also


159
0:9:48,0 --> 0:9:50,8
very bright and white.


160
0:9:50,8 --> 0:9:53,533
Some of the things that make
this one of my seven wonders


161
0:9:53,533 --> 0:9:58,8
include that look of the church
that looks kind of like a sail


162
0:9:58,8 --> 0:10:2,867
and that it has that ability
to come in different shapes,


163
0:10:2,867 --> 0:10:6,67
but they've still managed to
use some repetition here.


164
0:10:6,67 --> 0:10:8,733
You'll see that they've repeated
the same shapes in the


165
0:10:8,733 --> 0:10:12,633
three sails or three surfaces.


166
0:10:12,633 --> 0:10:14,9
And the other thing that's
really interesting about


167
0:10:14,9 --> 0:10:19,5
this project is the bright
whiteness of the concrete.


168
0:10:19,5 --> 0:10:22,7
They actually used an add
mixture that's available


169
0:10:22,7 --> 0:10:28,267
from an Italian company that
is a self-cleaning concrete.


170
0:10:28,267 --> 0:10:32,533
So now they won't have to go
back and clean this material


171
0:10:32,533 --> 0:10:36,3
over and over again, it'll stay
bright and white like this.


172
0:10:36,3 --> 0:10:39,767
The other thing that that
add mixture does is allow


173
0:10:39,767 --> 0:10:44,0
the concrete to absorb CO2.


174
0:10:44,0 --> 0:10:47,8
So it actually cleans
the air around it.


175
0:10:47,8 --> 0:10:51,6
We've only seen it used in
one project so far in the US.


176
0:10:51,6 --> 0:10:53,6
I think it's still kind
of expensive, but I think


177
0:10:53,6 --> 0:10:56,467
it's one of the ways
that we'll see concrete


178
0:10:56,467 --> 0:10:58,2
changing in the future.


179
0:10:58,2 --> 0:11:0,733
It's not something that's
just used for precast,


180
0:11:0,733 --> 0:11:3,133
you can use it really for
any kind of concrete.


181
0:11:3,133 --> 0:11:5,6
But, you know, I think that's
just a really beautiful example


182
0:11:5,6 --> 0:11:7,933
of new technology.


183
0:11:7,933 --> 0:11:9,367
>> Dr. Wafeek Wahby:
I have a question.


184
0:11:9,367 --> 0:11:11,833
In the back, please,
back one slide.


185
0:11:11,833 --> 0:11:18,7
Any idea if these three bending
parts are hollow or kind of a


186
0:11:18,7 --> 0:11:21,567
shell of some sort?


187
0:11:21,567 --> 0:11:24,267
>> Ms. McIntyre:
I believe, no, they are not.


188
0:11:24,267 --> 0:11:28,2
They are about, I think they
are about 8 inches thick.


189
0:11:28,2 --> 0:11:32,33
>> Dr. Wahby:
Okay, just one solid thing?


190
0:11:32,33 --> 0:11:36,0
>> Ms. McIntyre:
They are solid panels.


191
0:11:36,0 --> 0:11:39,467
I believe they are structural
as well as being radius.


192
0:11:39,467 --> 0:11:41,33
>> Dr. Wahby:
Okay, thanks.


193
0:11:41,33 --> 0:11:45,7
>> Ms McIntyre:
I'm going to go back so we can


194
0:11:45,7 --> 0:11:47,733
look at the
Sidney Opera House.


195
0:11:47,733 --> 0:11:49,9
I always think that it's kind
of interesting to look at this,


196
0:11:49,9 --> 0:11:53,5
which is a very modern example
of precast concrete.


197
0:11:53,5 --> 0:11:57,2
And really, you can look back
at the Sidney Opera House


198
0:11:57,2 --> 0:12:1,6
up on the top, all of the
white components that


199
0:12:1,6 --> 0:12:5,1
look like sails, those are
all precast concrete,


200
0:12:5,1 --> 0:12:8,267
it's on a steel frame.


201
0:12:8,267 --> 0:12:13,7
Jørn Utzon was the name of the
architect on that project,


202
0:12:13,7 --> 0:12:17,867
and he designed this, it
was a design competition.


203
0:12:17,867 --> 0:12:23,0
He kind of snuck the design in
at the last minute and they had


204
0:12:23,0 --> 0:12:25,633
picked something else, but
then when they saw this


205
0:12:25,633 --> 0:12:28,533
they said, "No, we have to
have this opera house".


206
0:12:28,533 --> 0:12:31,9
And that's really great, but the
technology was not there at the


207
0:12:31,9 --> 0:12:35,867
time to build it, so then there
were all sorts of delays.


208
0:12:35,867 --> 0:12:39,433
And what he finally figured out
was he was going to be able to


209
0:12:39,433 --> 0:12:43,167
make it affordable and make it
happen by keeping that radius


210
0:12:43,167 --> 0:12:47,233
exactly the same for all of
those different panels and to


211
0:12:47,233 --> 0:12:52,667
create a lot of repetition even
without having one piece be


212
0:12:52,667 --> 0:12:55,367
exactly the same as the others.


213
0:12:55,367 --> 0:12:59,267
So he kind of played on
the radius to create


214
0:12:59,267 --> 0:13:1,433
those different sails.


215
0:13:1,433 --> 0:13:3,933
It was one of the first
projects to really use


216
0:13:3,933 --> 0:13:8,1
building information
modeling and computers,


217
0:13:8,1 --> 0:13:10,233
computer aided design.


218
0:13:10,233 --> 0:13:13,3
And it was very controversial
because it kept having delay


219
0:13:13,3 --> 0:13:18,5
after delay after delay, and
finally the architect got


220
0:13:18,5 --> 0:13:25,1
kicked off the project and he
never saw the finished project.


221
0:13:25,1 --> 0:13:28,833
It's such an interesting story,
you could make a movie out of


222
0:13:28,833 --> 0:13:33,1
the creation of the
Sidney Opera House.


223
0:13:33,1 --> 0:13:38,967
But again, this is one of the
Seven Wonders because it really


224
0:13:38,967 --> 0:13:43,533
kind of did something completely
new with precast concrete.


225
0:13:43,533 --> 0:13:49,6
The TransAmerica Tower is in San
Francisco, and it's the tallest


226
0:13:49,6 --> 0:13:55,667
architecturally precast-clad
building in the US.


227
0:13:55,667 --> 0:13:58,6
And some of the things that
make it really interesting


228
0:13:58,6 --> 0:14:4,0
include that they had to be able
to, you know, put it up with


229
0:14:4,0 --> 0:14:8,33
architectural precast and clad
the exterior in some place that,


230
0:14:8,33 --> 0:14:10,267
you know, is going to have
to have high seismic,


231
0:14:10,267 --> 0:14:13,967
in a high-seismic zone.


232
0:14:13,967 --> 0:14:16,7
So that was kind of
interesting as well.


233
0:14:16,7 --> 0:14:20,133
They wanted something that, you
know, they could keep clean and


234
0:14:20,133 --> 0:14:26,167
neat and did it with
precast concrete.


235
0:14:26,167 --> 0:14:30,533
Another early example of
architectural precast.


236
0:14:30,533 --> 0:14:33,833
COSI is a little bit
closer to home.


237
0:14:33,833 --> 0:14:40,9
It's in Columbus, and
it's the Columbus Museum


238
0:14:40,9 --> 0:14:44,2
of Science and Industry.


239
0:14:44,2 --> 0:14:50,67
Arata Isozaki is a Japanese
architect, he was the one


240
0:14:50,67 --> 0:14:52,67
who designed it.


241
0:14:52,67 --> 0:14:56,467
And again, very organic in the
way that he used concrete as a


242
0:14:56,467 --> 0:15:0,967
very flowable material and
actually used that ability


243
0:15:0,967 --> 0:15:3,267
to curve and shape it.


244
0:15:3,267 --> 0:15:5,9
Each one of these pieces, you
can kind of see the people are


245
0:15:5,9 --> 0:15:9,967
right here, so each one of
these pieces is 60 feet tall


246
0:15:9,967 --> 0:15:13,6
and about 10 feet wide.


247
0:15:13,6 --> 0:15:18,567
It was cast all in one piece in
specialty forms and then the


248
0:15:18,567 --> 0:15:22,767
precaster who did it had to
create specialty trucks to cart


249
0:15:22,767 --> 0:15:25,67
it to the job site.


250
0:15:25,67 --> 0:15:29,133
They had to create specialty
forms for it and had to be


251
0:15:29,133 --> 0:15:32,9
very careful with all of the
handling and erection of this


252
0:15:32,9 --> 0:15:36,567
piece because, you know, you
can't pick up a piece of


253
0:15:36,567 --> 0:15:40,4
precast in the middle because
it's actually more fragile than


254
0:15:40,4 --> 0:15:44,33
you think it would be, it
can just break into two.


255
0:15:44,33 --> 0:15:47,0
So they had to be very
careful about handling


256
0:15:47,0 --> 0:15:51,9
and erecting this project.


257
0:15:51,9 --> 0:15:55,633
And there's some, just some
examples of what it looked like


258
0:15:55,633 --> 0:16:3,67
when they were handling it.


259
0:16:3,67 --> 0:16:6,933
So that's kind of my fun part,
and I apologize that the


260
0:16:6,933 --> 0:16:9,4
pictures didn't translate.


261
0:16:9,4 --> 0:16:15,333
Anybody got any questions about
anything you've seen so far?


262
0:16:15,333 --> 0:16:17,67
No?


263
0:16:17,67 --> 0:16:21,0
Alright, well, let's get
down to the nitty gritty.


264
0:16:21,0 --> 0:16:24,3
When I talk about precast
products, sometimes I like to


265
0:16:24,3 --> 0:16:26,7
think about music as well.


266
0:16:26,7 --> 0:16:30,333
So here I've got my George
Handel, who's one of my


267
0:16:30,333 --> 0:16:33,833
favorites, and Metallica,
who I also like.


268
0:16:33,833 --> 0:16:37,933
And I love thinking about
precast the same way I think


269
0:16:37,933 --> 0:16:40,967
about music because you
are taking these two very


270
0:16:40,967 --> 0:16:44,767
diverse types of music.


271
0:16:44,767 --> 0:16:48,867
You probably, in a lot of ways,
wouldn't think of those two


272
0:16:48,867 --> 0:16:53,3
groups, or a composer and that
group in the same light, but


273
0:16:53,3 --> 0:16:57,0
when you think about it, they're
using all of the same notes.


274
0:16:57,0 --> 0:17:1,2
They are creating the music
using the same scale, the same


275
0:17:1,2 --> 0:17:5,3
12 notes, the same keys on a
piano, and that's the same thing


276
0:17:5,3 --> 0:17:7,933
that's happening with
precast concrete.


277
0:17:7,933 --> 0:17:11,33
So I always like to think
about it that way.


278
0:17:11,33 --> 0:19:2,633
♪ [music playing--
no dialogue] ♪♪.


279
0:19:2,633 --> 0:19:6,133
Really, what that shows is all
of the different pieces of


280
0:19:6,133 --> 0:19:9,33
precast flying in and
coming together.


281
0:19:9,33 --> 0:19:10,733
It's all cool stuff.


282
0:19:10,733 --> 0:19:14,3
I wanted to kind of take you
through the notes on the scale


283
0:19:14,3 --> 0:19:17,767
or the keys on the piano
in terms of what happens


284
0:19:17,767 --> 0:19:20,767
in the precast industry.


285
0:19:20,767 --> 0:19:24,33
And that would be what common,
what the products are


286
0:19:24,33 --> 0:19:26,0
that are commonly used.


287
0:19:26,0 --> 0:19:28,167
So probably the most common
product that you're going


288
0:19:28,167 --> 0:19:30,833
to see is hollowcore.


289
0:19:30,833 --> 0:19:35,433
Hollowcore comes in widths of
2 feet, 4 feet, and 8 feet,


290
0:19:35,433 --> 0:19:39,2
but it's typically going to
be 4 feet long, and it can be


291
0:19:39,2 --> 0:19:42,933
anywhere from 6 inches deep
to 16 inches deep.


292
0:19:42,933 --> 0:19:46,6
But usually you're going to see
a piece of hollowcore that is


293
0:19:46,6 --> 0:19:51,933
4 feet wide and 10 to 12 inches
deep, and then it's got these


294
0:19:51,933 --> 0:19:55,3
cores that are cast
in the middle of it.


295
0:19:55,3 --> 0:19:58,767
So who can tell me why they
think the cores are cast


296
0:19:58,767 --> 0:20:1,7
in the middle of it?


297
0:20:1,7 --> 0:20:3,33
Yeah?


298
0:20:3,33 --> 0:20:4,7
>> male speaker:
[unclear audio].


299
0:20:4,7 --> 0:20:6,3
>> Ms. McIntyre:
Absolutely, yeah.


300
0:20:6,3 --> 0:20:8,33
That's it exactly.


301
0:20:8,33 --> 0:20:11,167
Because you get the strength of
the concrete and you can combine


302
0:20:11,167 --> 0:20:16,67
that with the strength of
steel that you are doing the


303
0:20:16,67 --> 0:20:19,333
prestressing with and you don't
need all that extra weight.


304
0:20:19,333 --> 0:20:22,667
Weight is going to be one of the
downfalls for precast concrete.


305
0:20:22,667 --> 0:20:23,833
Yeah?


306
0:20:23,833 --> 0:20:25,3
>> male speaker:
[unclear audio].


307
0:20:25,3 --> 0:20:26,567
>> Ms. McIntyre:
Oh, yes.


308
0:20:26,567 --> 0:20:30,333
He said to decrease the
weight of the pieces,


309
0:20:30,333 --> 0:20:33,33
which was exactly right.


310
0:20:33,33 --> 0:20:35,4
>> male speaker:
[unclear audio].


311
0:20:35,4 --> 0:20:36,933
>> Ms. McIntyre:
It is also the saving of


312
0:20:36,933 --> 0:20:41,133
materials, but for the most
part it's the weight, because


313
0:20:41,133 --> 0:20:45,167
weight is going to be your
one thing that you want to


314
0:20:45,167 --> 0:20:47,4
watch out for with, or
one of the things that


315
0:20:47,4 --> 0:20:51,8
you're going to want to watch
out for with precast concrete.


316
0:20:51,8 --> 0:20:54,933
You can manufacture it in a
couple of different ways.


317
0:20:54,933 --> 0:20:57,633
One is a wet cast method,
where you have a pretty


318
0:20:57,633 --> 0:21:1,33
typical wet mix of concrete.


319
0:21:1,33 --> 0:21:6,9
You put hoses in the forms that
kind of look like fire hoses.


320
0:21:6,9 --> 0:21:9,6
You place the concrete
on top of it.


321
0:21:9,6 --> 0:21:14,267
As the concrete cures, you
pull those hoses out of it


322
0:21:14,267 --> 0:21:16,333
and you end up
with those cores.


323
0:21:16,333 --> 0:21:19,867
The other way is you can use an
extruded method, and with that


324
0:21:19,867 --> 0:21:26,767
the concrete is very dry and it
actually comes out of a machine.


325
0:21:26,767 --> 0:21:30,0
I always liken it to a tube of
toothpaste, where you're kind of


326
0:21:30,0 --> 0:21:32,833
pushing the concrete out.


327
0:21:32,833 --> 0:21:35,167
The concrete might be about
the same consistency


328
0:21:35,167 --> 0:21:37,33
of toothpaste as well.


329
0:21:37,33 --> 0:21:39,4
And you might have augurs
working in there, and


330
0:21:39,4 --> 0:21:42,267
that's going to create
the openings in it.


331
0:21:42,267 --> 0:21:46,833
And with that dry mix you can
almost walk on it immediately.


332
0:21:46,833 --> 0:21:49,233
So that's the couple of
different areas that you


333
0:21:49,233 --> 0:21:51,167
can manufacture it in.


334
0:21:51,167 --> 0:21:54,6
Hollowcore, usually, is going
to be about 30 feet long.


335
0:21:54,6 --> 0:21:58,233
And we see a lot of it
used for hotels, motels,


336
0:21:58,233 --> 0:22:5,667
single-family condominiums,
schools, any place where you


337
0:22:5,667 --> 0:22:10,433
want to get a nice long span
and any place that fire safety


338
0:22:10,433 --> 0:22:12,167
is going to be an issue.


339
0:22:12,167 --> 0:22:17,67
It can be a really good product
in any of those cases.


340
0:22:17,67 --> 0:22:18,767
Double tees.


341
0:22:18,767 --> 0:22:20,867
They're called double tees
because that's what they


342
0:22:20,867 --> 0:22:23,567
look like, two T's right
next to each other.


343
0:22:23,567 --> 0:22:27,433
Double tees have two parts
of the product.


344
0:22:27,433 --> 0:22:30,833
The first part is your top
surface that goes across the


345
0:22:30,833 --> 0:22:34,467
top of the tees, and that's
going to be called your flange.


346
0:22:34,467 --> 0:22:38,7
Your flange is usually going
to be about 12 feet wide.


347
0:22:38,7 --> 0:22:42,4
Sometimes we have 15 feet
wide, but usually it's going


348
0:22:42,4 --> 0:22:44,267
to be about 12 feet wide.


349
0:22:44,267 --> 0:22:47,133
And then you'll have the
two stems coming down,


350
0:22:47,133 --> 0:22:52,367
the two stems of the tee, and
those are usually going to be


351
0:22:52,367 --> 0:22:54,833
about 18 inches deep.


352
0:22:54,833 --> 0:22:57,667
And then you're going to
have a piece of precast


353
0:22:57,667 --> 0:23:3,1
that's generally 60 feet
long and 12 feet wide, but


354
0:23:3,1 --> 0:23:7,433
you can go up to about
110 feet long with this.


355
0:23:7,433 --> 0:23:11,233
So, we see this used a lot for
parking decks, that's really


356
0:23:11,233 --> 0:23:13,767
the number one thing that
you see it used in.


357
0:23:13,767 --> 0:23:17,6
You also see it used for, the
other building that I have down


358
0:23:17,6 --> 0:23:22,33
there is a convention center,
where you might have heavier


359
0:23:22,33 --> 0:23:29,1
loads on the floor, swimming
pools, some condominium


360
0:23:29,1 --> 0:23:32,7
buildings will use them where
you need longer spans.


361
0:23:32,7 --> 0:23:36,67
So, this is generally longer
spans and a little bit heavier


362
0:23:36,67 --> 0:23:43,5
duty floor product than you
would get with the hollowcore.


363
0:23:43,5 --> 0:23:46,767
Architectural precast, this
is what you're going to see


364
0:23:46,767 --> 0:23:49,2
when you visit Alsip.


365
0:23:49,2 --> 0:23:53,167
And architectural precast really
starts to be where you have


366
0:23:53,167 --> 0:23:57,367
a lot more color, texture.


367
0:23:57,367 --> 0:24:1,8
Usually it's a cladding product
on the exterior of the building.


368
0:24:1,8 --> 0:24:5,867
You can have color integrated
right into it.


369
0:24:5,867 --> 0:24:8,8
You're going to start to
have your curved pieces.


370
0:24:8,8 --> 0:24:11,267
You're going to start to
have more decorative


371
0:24:11,267 --> 0:24:13,467
detail added to it.


372
0:24:13,467 --> 0:24:15,767
And these are usually
cast in wooden forms


373
0:24:15,767 --> 0:24:17,867
rather than in steel forms.


374
0:24:17,867 --> 0:24:22,9
So you will have some repetition
with them, but usually you're


375
0:24:22,9 --> 0:24:26,767
going to have formwork
that's built specifically


376
0:24:26,767 --> 0:24:30,433
for that particular building.


377
0:24:30,433 --> 0:24:33,233
Then you can also
have wall panels.


378
0:24:33,233 --> 0:24:41,3
Wall panels can still have a
little bit of decorative pieces


379
0:24:41,3 --> 0:24:45,233
to them, but in most
cases rather than having


380
0:24:45,233 --> 0:24:47,9
the color integrated right
into it you're going to


381
0:24:47,9 --> 0:24:51,233
stain over the concrete,
so both the yellow and


382
0:24:51,233 --> 0:24:54,4
the blue are stained
right into there.


383
0:24:54,4 --> 0:24:57,733
Sometimes we see people just
leave the concrete exposed


384
0:24:57,733 --> 0:25:0,3
like you see here.


385
0:25:0,3 --> 0:25:3,3
But these are usually cast
in what our industry calls


386
0:25:3,3 --> 0:25:5,267
long line beds.


387
0:25:5,267 --> 0:25:9,767
And so those beds can be
150 feet long, and they


388
0:25:9,767 --> 0:25:14,633
cast multiple pieces all at
the same time, so usually


389
0:25:14,633 --> 0:25:21,0
not as much decorative
detail added to those.


390
0:25:21,0 --> 0:25:23,7
Then you can also have
structural products.


391
0:25:23,7 --> 0:25:30,67
Those would be columns, beams,
inverted T-beams, any kind of


392
0:25:30,67 --> 0:25:34,6
structural wall panel, things
like that, and that can be


393
0:25:34,6 --> 0:25:37,467
the entire structure and
frame of a building.


394
0:25:37,467 --> 0:25:41,933
Typically when you're using
precast as the structural


395
0:25:41,933 --> 0:25:45,967
system, we see it usually
used anywhere from 2 stories


396
0:25:45,967 --> 0:25:50,6
to about 11 or 12 stories,
would be typical.


397
0:25:50,6 --> 0:25:54,7
There is a project in California
that goes 22 stories, that's


398
0:25:54,7 --> 0:25:59,5
about as high as it's gone
but, you know, we see a lot of


399
0:25:59,5 --> 0:26:8,267
8- to 12-story structures
done in structural precast.


400
0:26:8,267 --> 0:26:11,133
We also have modular
construction,


401
0:26:11,133 --> 0:26:13,8
in this case it's a prison.


402
0:26:13,8 --> 0:26:16,333
That's probably the most
popular use for it where


403
0:26:16,333 --> 0:26:18,133
we've got the prison cells.


404
0:26:18,133 --> 0:26:22,3
And one of the reasons that this
is so popular for the prisons is


405
0:26:22,3 --> 0:26:24,733
it can all be done off-site.


406
0:26:24,733 --> 0:26:28,233
So they add the furniture,
the communications equipment,


407
0:26:28,233 --> 0:26:32,367
the safety equipment, all
at the precaster's site.


408
0:26:32,367 --> 0:26:36,67
They bring it out to the job
site, they stack them, one right


409
0:26:36,67 --> 0:26:39,967
on top of the other, and in this
case they've got the two prison


410
0:26:39,967 --> 0:26:44,167
cells and then they've got a
lip coming out for a walkway.


411
0:26:44,167 --> 0:26:47,4
We don't see a whole lot of
prisons being built in Illinois


412
0:26:47,4 --> 0:26:50,733
right now considering we
have one sitting empty,


413
0:26:50,733 --> 0:26:55,5
but for awhile that
was being done.


414
0:26:55,5 --> 0:26:58,833
The interesting thing about
these is the whole idea of


415
0:26:58,833 --> 0:27:2,1
modularity is really being
carried into a lot of different


416
0:27:2,1 --> 0:27:7,7
products as well, the wall
panels and floor systems.


417
0:27:7,7 --> 0:27:11,0
I'm starting to see more
things being added


418
0:27:11,0 --> 0:27:13,67
at the precast plant.


419
0:27:13,67 --> 0:27:17,733
So the electrical conduit and
boxes are being cast right in,


420
0:27:17,733 --> 0:27:20,567
holes for the plumbing
being cast right in.


421
0:27:20,567 --> 0:27:24,333
So a lot of that is happening
at the manufacturer's site


422
0:27:24,333 --> 0:27:27,367
rather than happening
at the job site.


423
0:27:27,367 --> 0:27:30,3
And that's something that a lot
of insurance companies like


424
0:27:30,3 --> 0:27:35,567
because they feel it's a more
controlled environment.


425
0:27:35,567 --> 0:27:39,567
And then we also do a lot of
transportation products.


426
0:27:39,567 --> 0:27:42,733
In Illinois, the three biggest
transportation products,


427
0:27:42,733 --> 0:27:44,667
well, four really.


428
0:27:44,667 --> 0:27:48,9
Bulb tees, like you see
going across.


429
0:27:48,9 --> 0:27:52,967
Box beams--those are usually
for shorter bridges, they're


430
0:27:52,967 --> 0:27:58,167
hollow boxes, usually they have
like a styrofoam piece in the


431
0:27:58,167 --> 0:28:1,9
middle with four sides
of concrete around it.


432
0:28:1,9 --> 0:28:4,267
The bulb tees are shaped
kind of like this with


433
0:28:4,267 --> 0:28:7,333
a bulb on the bottom.


434
0:28:7,333 --> 0:28:11,467
Sound wall--up in the
Chicago area, there's quite


435
0:28:11,467 --> 0:28:13,5
a bit of sound wall.


436
0:28:13,5 --> 0:28:16,533
And then also
retaining wall systems.


437
0:28:16,533 --> 0:28:18,633
So those are the biggest
transportation products


438
0:28:18,633 --> 0:28:19,933
that we see.


439
0:28:19,933 --> 0:28:21,267
Yes?


440
0:28:21,267 --> 0:28:22,6
>> male speaker:
[unclear audio].


441
0:28:22,6 --> 0:28:23,733
>> Ms. McIntyre:
He was asking what


442
0:28:23,733 --> 0:28:25,1
sound wall is.


443
0:28:25,1 --> 0:28:28,167
Sound wall is a wall
system that you would see


444
0:28:28,167 --> 0:28:29,9
on the side of a highway.


445
0:28:29,9 --> 0:28:33,267
So usually it's some kind of
decorative concrete piece


446
0:28:33,267 --> 0:28:37,567
about 8 inches thick.


447
0:28:37,567 --> 0:28:40,867
You see it in more densely
populated urban areas where


448
0:28:40,867 --> 0:28:43,333
they don't want the sound of
the highway going to the homes


449
0:28:43,333 --> 0:28:46,467
on either side, or the
businesses on either side.


450
0:28:46,467 --> 0:28:52,467
So we see a lot of that up
north, not so much down here.


451
0:28:52,467 --> 0:28:56,267
So that's kind of the typical
products that you see


452
0:28:56,267 --> 0:28:57,967
with precast concrete.


453
0:28:57,967 --> 0:28:59,6
Does anybody have any
questions about any of


454
0:28:59,6 --> 0:29:5,8
the products that you've seen?


455
0:29:5,8 --> 0:29:7,667
>> male speaker:
I've got a quick question.


456
0:29:7,667 --> 0:29:8,867
>> Ms. McInyre:
Oh, yeah.


457
0:29:8,867 --> 0:29:10,833
>> male speaker:
On several of the buildings,


458
0:29:10,833 --> 0:29:13,6
like when they were
talking about buildings,


459
0:29:13,6 --> 0:29:16,0
I'm assuming that some of
that is hollowcore with


460
0:29:16,0 --> 0:29:20,9
some kind of insulation
[unclear audio] unit?


461
0:29:20,9 --> 0:29:22,433
>> Ms. McIntyre:
For the walls or for the floors?


462
0:29:22,433 --> 0:29:24,867
>> male speaker:
Yes, for the exterior,


463
0:29:24,867 --> 0:29:26,967
primarily for the
exterior walls.


464
0:29:26,967 --> 0:29:28,5
>> Ms. McIntyre:
Yeah, some of them, not so they


465
0:29:28,5 --> 0:29:31,4
don't use, in this part of the
country we don't see a whole lot


466
0:29:31,4 --> 0:29:34,4
of hollowcore being used
for the wall systems.


467
0:29:34,4 --> 0:29:37,233
In Wisconsin, we do
see that sometimes.


468
0:29:37,233 --> 0:29:40,4
So it's really a matter of
what's available locally.


469
0:29:40,4 --> 0:29:46,5
But yeah, you can put insulation
right into the wall panels.


470
0:29:46,5 --> 0:29:49,833
It depends on what you're using
it for that starts to make it


471
0:29:49,833 --> 0:29:51,433
a little bit more expensive.


472
0:29:51,433 --> 0:29:54,3
So a lot of times you'll put up
the concrete system and then


473
0:29:54,3 --> 0:29:57,733
put the insulaion and then
put the dry wall over it if


474
0:29:57,733 --> 0:29:59,433
you're going to dry wall it.


475
0:29:59,433 --> 0:30:2,2
But if you're not going to
dry wall over it, you can


476
0:30:2,2 --> 0:30:7,467
put the insulation right
in the middle of it.


477
0:30:7,467 --> 0:30:9,6
Anything else?


478
0:30:9,6 --> 0:30:11,767
Well, I thought I would just
show you some projects just so


479
0:30:11,767 --> 0:30:16,3
you can see what typical
projects look like with precast.


480
0:30:16,3 --> 0:30:21,133
We do a lot of athletic
facilities--the risers, beams,


481
0:30:21,133 --> 0:30:24,567
raker beams, the
exterior systems.


482
0:30:24,567 --> 0:30:28,1
We see a lot of this thin brick
being added right to the


483
0:30:28,1 --> 0:30:31,667
precast wall panels so you get
a lot of decorative finishes


484
0:30:31,667 --> 0:30:35,2
that way, but we see
a lot of those.


485
0:30:35,2 --> 0:30:39,933
And a lot of schools are using
precast these days, whether


486
0:30:39,933 --> 0:30:45,33
they be just the gymnasium
with the steel form or the


487
0:30:45,33 --> 0:30:49,6
steel structure on the interior
with precast wall panels


488
0:30:49,6 --> 0:30:53,2
around it or decorative pieces.


489
0:30:53,2 --> 0:30:56,867
Centralia High School just did
a really nice high school


490
0:30:56,867 --> 0:30:59,467
out of precast.


491
0:30:59,467 --> 0:31:1,6
A lot of healh care facilities.


492
0:31:1,6 --> 0:31:8,2
In the healthcare market we see
more of the exterior skin on the


493
0:31:8,2 --> 0:31:11,7
cladding products being used.


494
0:31:11,7 --> 0:31:15,3
Some designers feel like
there's vibration issues that


495
0:31:15,3 --> 0:31:19,667
they want to stay away from
with the structural system.


496
0:31:19,667 --> 0:31:24,567
Although I have seen it used
successfully, structural systems


497
0:31:24,567 --> 0:31:28,767
used successfully in
healthcare as well.


498
0:31:28,767 --> 0:31:35,467
Industrial faciliies.


499
0:31:35,467 --> 0:31:40,367
Industrial facilities, a lot of
warehouses, food facilities,


500
0:31:40,367 --> 0:31:42,967
things like that, we see
a lot of those used.


501
0:31:42,967 --> 0:31:45,567
I don't even remember what
that picture looked like.


502
0:31:45,567 --> 0:31:47,433
Municipal buildings.


503
0:31:47,433 --> 0:31:51,933
We see a lot of every, well
lately, half of my members seem


504
0:31:51,933 --> 0:31:57,733
to be working on water systems,
water reclamation projects.


505
0:31:57,733 --> 0:32:0,6
That seems to be one of
the few building types


506
0:32:0,6 --> 0:32:3,0
that's still going
up these days.


507
0:32:3,0 --> 0:32:5,4
But a lot of municipal
buildings, anywhere where


508
0:32:5,4 --> 0:32:7,533
the tenant is going to be
there for a long time and


509
0:32:7,533 --> 0:32:11,633
starts to really look at the
long-term cost-effectiveness


510
0:32:11,633 --> 0:32:16,9
of using insulated wall
panels, for instance.


511
0:32:16,9 --> 0:32:18,1
>> Dr. Wahby:
I have a question.


512
0:32:18,1 --> 0:32:19,467
>> Ms. McIntyre:
Yes?


513
0:32:19,467 --> 0:32:20,633
>> Dr. Wahby:
The previous screen, the


514
0:32:20,633 --> 0:32:23,33
building to the right,
these walls are structural


515
0:32:23,33 --> 0:32:25,367
or pure architectural?


516
0:32:25,367 --> 0:32:26,467
>> Ms. McIntyre:
Right here?


517
0:32:26,467 --> 0:32:27,733
>> Dr. Wahby:
Yes, and the shell.


518
0:32:27,733 --> 0:32:28,867
>> Ms. McIntyre:
Yes, those are actually


519
0:32:28,867 --> 0:32:30,333
structural wall panels.


520
0:32:30,333 --> 0:32:35,7
It's what our industry likes to
call a total precast building,


521
0:32:35,7 --> 0:32:39,733
which means that it's got
precast columns and beams.


522
0:32:39,733 --> 0:32:42,667
You can see the double tee
floors, and then the exterior


523
0:32:42,667 --> 0:32:47,9
wall panels are also structural,
so they have eliminated all the


524
0:32:47,9 --> 0:32:54,267
perimeter structural framing.


525
0:32:54,267 --> 0:32:56,667
Office buildings.


526
0:32:56,667 --> 0:32:59,767
This is the FBI building
in Chicago.


527
0:32:59,767 --> 0:33:2,3
One of the interesting things
that we've been doing a lot of


528
0:33:2,3 --> 0:33:6,233
research on recently is
blast-resistant design.


529
0:33:6,233 --> 0:33:10,467
We've been working with the US
Airforce on blast-resistant,


530
0:33:10,467 --> 0:33:12,633
and that seems to be a
hot topic with a lot of


531
0:33:12,633 --> 0:33:15,933
government buildings ever
since Oklahoma City.


532
0:33:15,933 --> 0:33:19,633
That seems to be
a key element.


533
0:33:19,633 --> 0:33:22,0
One of the other interesting
things, this is a building


534
0:33:22,0 --> 0:33:25,8
actually in Milwaukee, where
they took all the cladding off


535
0:33:25,8 --> 0:33:29,233
and they wanted to save the
office building so they re-clad


536
0:33:29,233 --> 0:33:32,8
it in architectural precast,
and that's another trend that


537
0:33:32,8 --> 0:33:36,433
I've seen quite a bit of.


538
0:33:36,433 --> 0:33:41,233
And then a lot of residential,
multi-family housing.


539
0:33:41,233 --> 0:33:45,233
Not a lot of people are building
that this year, but in


540
0:33:45,233 --> 0:33:50,433
past years we've seen precast
used for that quite a bit.


541
0:33:50,433 --> 0:33:52,833
And then transportation
products.


542
0:33:52,833 --> 0:33:55,133
This is kind of interesting.


543
0:33:55,133 --> 0:33:59,633
This bridge here is going over
the Dust Plains River on the


544
0:33:59,633 --> 0:34:7,1
new leg of I-355, and the
beams going across there


545
0:34:7,1 --> 0:34:10,567
were 176 feet long.


546
0:34:10,567 --> 0:34:14,2
So one of the great things about
that is it really shows you


547
0:34:14,2 --> 0:34:17,933
how long you can get
with precast concrete.


548
0:34:17,933 --> 0:34:22,1
They really were trying to be
very careful about putting


549
0:34:22,1 --> 0:34:26,733
anything into the river and
disturbing the habitat of a


550
0:34:26,733 --> 0:34:30,133
dragonfly that was there,
so they had to have these


551
0:34:30,133 --> 0:34:34,33
long beams and not
disturb the habitat.


552
0:34:34,33 --> 0:34:36,9
And they went to a lot of
expense and trouble to


553
0:34:36,9 --> 0:34:40,867
create this bridge, and then
it turns out that where the


554
0:34:40,867 --> 0:34:44,267
bridge casts a shadow the
dragonflies won't fly there


555
0:34:44,267 --> 0:34:50,67
anyway, so it ended
up being for naught.


556
0:34:50,67 --> 0:34:52,967
But it did prove that
you can go 176 feet


557
0:34:52,967 --> 0:34:56,7
with precast bridge beams.


558
0:34:56,7 --> 0:34:59,8
And then probably one of the
most common types of projects


559
0:34:59,8 --> 0:35:7,67
that you're going to see
with precast products are


560
0:35:7,67 --> 0:35:9,867
going to be parking decks.


561
0:35:9,867 --> 0:35:14,4
You know, that 60-foot-long
double tee that'll give you,


562
0:35:14,4 --> 0:35:18,667
you know, a couple of bays
of parking and you can do


563
0:35:18,667 --> 0:35:21,967
decorative finishes on the
exterior, you can do simple


564
0:35:21,967 --> 0:35:24,0
finishes on the exterior.


565
0:35:24,0 --> 0:35:25,933
I just did a seminar
yesterday on the history


566
0:35:25,933 --> 0:35:28,733
of the parking deck.


567
0:35:28,733 --> 0:35:33,333
And it's kind of interesting
to see, it's kind of turning,


568
0:35:33,333 --> 0:35:37,167
they used to look a lot like
buildings, and then for awhile


569
0:35:37,167 --> 0:35:40,633
they were very kind of simple
gray boxes and now it's kind of


570
0:35:40,633 --> 0:35:43,8
turning back and now they're all
looking like buildings again,


571
0:35:43,8 --> 0:35:47,167
so that's kind of interesting.


572
0:35:47,167 --> 0:35:53,7
So that's really typically where
we see the products being used.


573
0:35:53,7 --> 0:35:59,4
You guys have any questions
about the projects?


574
0:35:59,4 --> 0:36:1,667
Okay, well, I thought
I would finish up by


575
0:36:1,667 --> 0:36:5,333
showing you a plant tour.


576
0:36:5,333 --> 0:36:8,8
 >> narrator:
 This video will explain the


577
0:36:8,8 --> 0:36:12,3
 entire process of producing
 a prestressed concrete unit


578
0:36:12,3 --> 0:36:14,167
 at a prestressing plant.


579
0:36:14,167 --> 0:36:17,267
 In this case, a double tee.


580
0:36:17,267 --> 0:36:20,767
 A double tee is used primarily
 in parking structures but can


581
0:36:20,767 --> 0:36:24,33
be used in virtually any type
of building, including office


582
0:36:24,33 --> 0:36:28,4
buildings, industrial buildings,
 and schools, to name a few.


583
0:36:28,4 --> 0:36:32,0
Double tees are kind of a unique
product, having a capability


584
0:36:32,0 --> 0:36:33,967
 of having a very long span.


585
0:36:33,967 --> 0:36:36,267
 And when we start talking
 long spans, you're talking


586
0:36:36,267 --> 0:36:41,767
 60 feet plus, and sometimes
 goes as high as 120 feet.


587
0:36:41,767 --> 0:36:43,133
 >> narrator:
 The typical day of a


588
0:36:43,133 --> 0:36:45,0
 prestressing plant usually
 starts very early


589
0:36:45,0 --> 0:36:47,0
 in the morning.


590
0:36:47,0 --> 0:36:50,567
 The product from the previous
 day's casting has cured by now


591
0:36:50,567 --> 0:36:53,2
 and the pieces need to be
 stripped from the form to


592
0:36:53,2 --> 0:36:56,5
 get ready for today's casting.


593
0:36:56,5 --> 0:36:59,133
 For any prestressing plant,
 it is very important to


594
0:36:59,133 --> 0:37:1,233
 maintain a clean plant.


595
0:37:1,233 --> 0:37:4,167
 Maintaining neatness is not
 only positive from an image


596
0:37:4,167 --> 0:37:7,267
 standpoint but also from a
 safety standpoint, since any


597
0:37:7,267 --> 0:37:10,1
debris that might be left over
from the day before could create


598
0:37:10,1 --> 0:37:14,67
 a tripping hazard or
 other safety problem.


599
0:37:14,67 --> 0:37:19,33
 The first part of the process
 is setting up of the form.


600
0:37:19,33 --> 0:37:22,2
 A thorough cleaning of the
 entire form is done with basic


601
0:37:22,2 --> 0:37:25,233
 labor and appropriate
 cleaning equipment.


602
0:37:25,233 --> 0:37:27,633
 Setting the side forms, or
 in the case of a typical


603
0:37:27,633 --> 0:37:30,9
 double tee, the forms may
 be fixed forms with an


604
0:37:30,9 --> 0:37:35,33
 appropriate draft to allow
 for easy stripping.


605
0:37:35,33 --> 0:37:37,0
 Once the bed is clean,
 it's ready for


606
0:37:37,0 --> 0:37:41,3
 setting up today's cast.


607
0:37:41,3 --> 0:37:44,9
 This particular bed is set
 up for five double tees,


608
0:37:44,9 --> 0:37:47,267
 each about 60 feet long.


609
0:37:47,267 --> 0:37:51,433
 The bed has a total
 length of 400 feet.


610
0:37:51,433 --> 0:37:54,9
 This is a self-stressing form,
 where the form itself is


611
0:37:54,9 --> 0:37:57,533
 designed to take the total
 prestressed force and


612
0:37:57,533 --> 0:38:3,2
compression, and also to handle
the eccentricity of the strands.


613
0:38:3,2 --> 0:38:6,367
 Sometimes the producer may use
 a form that is set between


614
0:38:6,367 --> 0:38:9,833
 bulkheads that are built
 right into the ground.


615
0:38:9,833 --> 0:38:13,167
 The prestressing force is then
 resisted entirely by the


616
0:38:13,167 --> 0:38:16,567
bulkheads and their foundations.


617
0:38:16,567 --> 0:38:18,967
 Next, the strands are
 placed in the form and


618
0:38:18,967 --> 0:38:22,2
 extended from end to end.


619
0:38:22,2 --> 0:38:25,1
Crew members thread the strands
 through each of the dividers


620
0:38:25,1 --> 0:38:29,233
 and then run them through the
 stressing plates at each end.


621
0:38:29,233 --> 0:38:31,2
 The typical spacing
 of the strands is


622
0:38:31,2 --> 0:38:35,3
 approximately 2 inches.


623
0:38:35,3 --> 0:38:38,7
 This divider is a steel device
 that separates the individual


624
0:38:38,7 --> 0:38:41,9
 double tee units from
 one another.


625
0:38:41,9 --> 0:38:44,5
 A gap of about a foot is
 typical between the ends


626
0:38:44,5 --> 0:38:46,6
 of the adjacent pieces.


627
0:38:46,6 --> 0:38:50,367
This gap is required so the
strands can be accessed and cut


628
0:38:50,367 --> 0:38:55,833
 and that each double tee can
 be stripped from the forms.


629
0:38:55,833 --> 0:38:59,0
 The next step is the
 tensioning of the strands.


630
0:38:59,0 --> 0:39:2,3
 In this case, we have a strand
 pattern with straight strands


631
0:39:2,3 --> 0:39:6,67
 of six strands in each
 stem, as shown here.


632
0:39:6,67 --> 0:39:10,67
The strands are first tensioned
 to about two to five kips,


633
0:39:10,67 --> 0:39:14,0
 based on the gauge
 pressure reading.


634
0:39:14,0 --> 0:39:17,2
 In this case, a mark is
 made on the strand after


635
0:39:17,2 --> 0:39:19,933
 the preload is applied.


636
0:39:19,933 --> 0:39:23,67
The strand is then tensioned
to the specified level and


637
0:39:23,67 --> 0:39:27,3
is measured using the gauge
pressure on the hydraulic pump.


638
0:39:27,3 --> 0:39:30,5
 The QC technician then checks
 the elongation against


639
0:39:30,5 --> 0:39:33,7
 the theoretical elongation.


640
0:39:33,7 --> 0:39:36,533
 The requirement that is the
 force on the gauge and the


641
0:39:36,533 --> 0:39:40,533
 elongation must match
 within 5 percent.


642
0:39:40,533 --> 0:39:43,167
 If that tolerance is not
 achieved, the reason must


643
0:39:43,167 --> 0:39:45,533
 be established and the
 strand may have to be


644
0:39:45,533 --> 0:39:49,633
 de-tensioned and re-tensioned.


645
0:39:49,633 --> 0:39:52,5
 After the strands of this
 double tee are all stressed,


646
0:39:52,5 --> 0:39:55,5
 the remaining embeds
 are set in place.


647
0:39:55,5 --> 0:40:0,767
These include stem reinforcing,
 lifting devices that will be


648
0:40:0,767 --> 0:40:6,433
 used to strip and handle the
 piece, forms for block outs


649
0:40:6,433 --> 0:40:11,167
 in the flange and forms for
 blockouts in the stems,


650
0:40:11,167 --> 0:40:16,133
 flange reinforcing, and flange
 connectors, or vectors,


651
0:40:16,133 --> 0:40:18,4
 along the edges.


652
0:40:18,4 --> 0:40:21,3
In this case, one of the double
 tees in the bed has typical


653
0:40:21,3 --> 0:40:26,1
flange connectors applied along
one edge and special flat plate


654
0:40:26,1 --> 0:40:29,133
 connectors applied along the
 other edge to accommodate


655
0:40:29,133 --> 0:40:33,4
 connections across an
 expansion joint.


656
0:40:33,4 --> 0:40:36,733
 The form is now ready to have
concrete poured, but only after


657
0:40:36,733 --> 0:40:40,0
 a pre-pour quality control
 check has been made and the


658
0:40:40,0 --> 0:40:43,267
 QC person signs off on it.


659
0:40:43,267 --> 0:40:46,967
 This QC check can also be done
 by the bed superintendant and


660
0:40:46,967 --> 0:40:49,967
 depends on the particular
 plant's practices.


661
0:40:49,967 --> 0:40:52,633
 Either way, the check
 is critical to ensure an


662
0:40:52,633 --> 0:40:54,933
 end product with the
 highest quality.


663
0:40:54,933 --> 0:40:57,467
 There's all these things you
look for, the mesh, you look for


664
0:40:57,467 --> 0:41:0,133
anything that could be touching
 the stems on the bottom,


665
0:41:0,133 --> 0:41:2,9
 wire ties that might have fell
 in there, because that would


666
0:41:2,9 --> 0:41:5,0
 develop some type
 of a rough spot.


667
0:41:5,0 --> 0:41:6,233
 You check the length.


668
0:41:6,233 --> 0:41:8,867
 You want to make sure that
 the damps are correct.


669
0:41:8,867 --> 0:41:12,567
 Do we have the strand
 stripped properly?


670
0:41:12,567 --> 0:41:17,33
So, there are a lot of critical
 areas that you need to verify.


671
0:41:17,33 --> 0:41:18,5
 >> narrator:
 Concrete is mixed at the


672
0:41:18,5 --> 0:41:21,233
 batch plant under tightly
 controlled conditions.


673
0:41:21,233 --> 0:41:24,1
 The cement is supplied
 using tanker trucks.


674
0:41:24,1 --> 0:41:27,33
 Here the cement is being blown
 from the tanker through piping


675
0:41:27,33 --> 0:41:29,733
 to the cement silos.


676
0:41:29,733 --> 0:41:32,5
 When needed, aggregates
 are delivered to bins


677
0:41:32,5 --> 0:41:34,333
 in the batch plant.


678
0:41:34,333 --> 0:41:36,933
 The aggregates are stored
 outside of the batch plant


679
0:41:36,933 --> 0:41:38,8
 in separate bins.


680
0:41:38,8 --> 0:41:43,0
 In this case, an enclosed
vertical bin system is utilized.


681
0:41:43,0 --> 0:41:47,167
 During winter in northern
 climates, the aggregates must


682
0:41:47,167 --> 0:41:50,4
 be heated to get them to flow
 properly through the batching


683
0:41:50,4 --> 0:41:55,333
 system and to maintain proper
 concrete mix temperatures.


684
0:41:55,333 --> 0:41:57,233
 Payloaders are used to
 shuffle the materials


685
0:41:57,233 --> 0:41:59,433
 to the conveyor belt.


686
0:41:59,433 --> 0:42:3,1
Computers are used to
proportion the materials


687
0:42:3,1 --> 0:42:5,167
 for the desired concrete mix.


688
0:42:5,167 --> 0:42:9,967
Cement, sand, stone, water, and
 add-mixtures are measured


689
0:42:9,967 --> 0:42:13,1
 according to signals
 from the computer.


690
0:42:13,1 --> 0:42:16,0
 After the concrete is
 mixed, it is discharged


691
0:42:16,0 --> 0:42:18,0
 into a delivery device.


692
0:42:18,0 --> 0:42:20,133
 It's imperative that the
 concrete mix be delivered


693
0:42:20,133 --> 0:42:23,33
 to the form as
 soon as possible.


694
0:42:23,33 --> 0:42:25,967
 These vehicles are called
 tuckers, and they are used


695
0:42:25,967 --> 0:42:29,533
 to deliver the concrete
 to the bed in the yard.


696
0:42:29,533 --> 0:42:32,267
 A soft, consolidating
 concrete is being used


697
0:42:32,267 --> 0:42:35,2
 to cast these particular
 double tees.


698
0:42:35,2 --> 0:42:37,933
 With this type of concrete,
 vibration is not required


699
0:42:37,933 --> 0:42:40,233
 to consolidate the concrete.


700
0:42:40,233 --> 0:42:43,33
 However, minor controlled
 vibration is used in the


701
0:42:43,33 --> 0:42:46,2
 double tee stems to help
 remove air from the sides of


702
0:42:46,2 --> 0:42:49,9
 the form, reducing bug
 holes in the stems.


703
0:42:49,9 --> 0:42:53,167
 There are many advantages in
 using this type of concrete.


704
0:42:53,167 --> 0:42:56,967
 We do use self-consolidating
 concrete for our double tees.


705
0:42:56,967 --> 0:43:0,67
 We feel that it gives
 us a better finish.


706
0:43:0,67 --> 0:43:3,7
 We feel that it's easier to
 place, takes less labor,


707
0:43:3,7 --> 0:43:7,7
 less strain on the laborer
 to place that concrete.


708
0:43:7,7 --> 0:43:9,367
 >> narrator:
The QC Department will make the


709
0:43:9,367 --> 0:43:12,6
 necessary tests at this time,
 including a temperature check


710
0:43:12,6 --> 0:43:14,767
 of the concrete.


711
0:43:14,767 --> 0:43:18,767
 Since SCC is being used here,
 a spread test is done to check


712
0:43:18,767 --> 0:43:22,567
 the concrete flow in
 lieu of a slump test.


713
0:43:22,567 --> 0:43:24,9
 The spread is measured
 to assure conformance


714
0:43:24,9 --> 0:43:27,167
 to the planned spread.


715
0:43:27,167 --> 0:43:30,133
 The edges of the circle of
 concrete are also inspected


716
0:43:30,133 --> 0:43:32,5
 to check for segregation.


717
0:43:32,5 --> 0:43:37,0
The appearance is translated to
a visual stability index number.


718
0:43:37,0 --> 0:43:40,633
 There is a check
 for air content.


719
0:43:40,633 --> 0:43:43,5
 Cylinders are filled and
 will be used later for


720
0:43:43,5 --> 0:43:46,633
 strength tests of
 the cured concrete.


721
0:43:46,633 --> 0:43:50,133
 Back at the bed, the concrete
 placement continues.


722
0:43:50,133 --> 0:43:54,633
 A vibrating screed is used
 to level the surface evenly.


723
0:43:54,633 --> 0:43:57,933
 A bullfloat is used to
 finish the surface.


724
0:43:57,933 --> 0:44:0,767
 An evaporation-reducing
 spray is also being applied


725
0:44:0,767 --> 0:44:2,8
 to the surface to
 minimize the potential


726
0:44:2,8 --> 0:44:5,433
for plastic shrinkage cracking.


727
0:44:5,433 --> 0:44:8,0
 The final finish will vary
 depending on the use


728
0:44:8,0 --> 0:44:10,67
 of the double tee.


729
0:44:10,67 --> 0:44:13,467
 If a cast-in-place topping is
 necessary, the surface will be


730
0:44:13,467 --> 0:44:17,7
 made very rough so that a
 good bond will be achieved.


731
0:44:17,7 --> 0:44:20,567
 If it is a roof, the finish
 will be relatively smooth,


732
0:44:20,567 --> 0:44:22,933
 but not necessarily perfect.


733
0:44:22,933 --> 0:44:25,967
 In this case the surface is
 broomed, as these double tees


734
0:44:25,967 --> 0:44:29,1
 are being used in a
 parking structure.


735
0:44:29,1 --> 0:44:31,567
 Different patterns can be
 applied depending on the


736
0:44:31,567 --> 0:44:34,867
 needs of the project.


737
0:44:34,867 --> 0:44:37,667
 The bed is now in
 its curing stage.


738
0:44:37,667 --> 0:44:41,33
 Sometimes, particularly in
 cold climates, the double tee


739
0:44:41,33 --> 0:44:43,267
 may be covered with tarps.


740
0:44:43,267 --> 0:44:45,8
 In other areas,
 they may be open.


741
0:44:45,8 --> 0:44:50,0
Accelerated curing is often done
using live steam or radiant heat


742
0:44:50,0 --> 0:44:53,133
 from heaters attached
 to the form itself.


743
0:44:53,133 --> 0:44:57,1
 Double tees for parking
 garages really need to be


744
0:44:57,1 --> 0:44:59,233
 held to a high standard.


745
0:44:59,233 --> 0:45:1,433
 When they're assembled
 in a garage, they make


746
0:45:1,433 --> 0:45:3,5
 the finished surface.


747
0:45:3,5 --> 0:45:6,7
 There are tolerances for
 putting these pieces together,


748
0:45:6,7 --> 0:45:9,567
 offsets in the surfaces.


749
0:45:9,567 --> 0:45:12,4
 All of the connections are
 very sensitive as well.


750
0:45:12,4 --> 0:45:15,4
 To be executed properly, the
 embedments in the double tee


751
0:45:15,4 --> 0:45:17,667
 have to be placed properly.


752
0:45:17,667 --> 0:45:22,1
 So there are, again, a lot
 of critical issues that you


753
0:45:22,1 --> 0:45:24,667
 have to be concerned with
 to get proper performance


754
0:45:24,667 --> 0:45:28,233
 out of that simple double tee.


755
0:45:28,233 --> 0:45:31,733
 After 12 to 16 hours of
 curing, the tees are


756
0:45:31,733 --> 0:45:34,33
 ready to be stripped.


757
0:45:34,33 --> 0:45:37,333
 The QC Department first tests
 the concrete to be sure it has


758
0:45:37,333 --> 0:45:40,933
 achieved the strength required
 to de-tension the strands,


759
0:45:40,933 --> 0:45:43,967
 typically 3500 psi.


760
0:45:43,967 --> 0:45:47,567
 This is a typical test
 being conducted.


761
0:45:47,567 --> 0:45:51,2
The strands are de-tensioned in
a specific sequence established


762
0:45:51,2 --> 0:45:54,9
 by the QC Department or
 the plant engineer.


763
0:45:54,9 --> 0:45:58,233
 Here, personnel are positioned
 at each end of the bed and at


764
0:45:58,233 --> 0:46:1,6
 some of the intermediate
 bulkhead locations.


765
0:46:1,6 --> 0:46:5,933
 On a signal, they burn
 the strand at each end.


766
0:46:5,933 --> 0:46:9,267
 After all the strands are cut
and block-out formwork has been


767
0:46:9,267 --> 0:46:12,967
 removed, the tees are
 stripped from the form.


768
0:46:12,967 --> 0:46:15,933
 Cables are attached to the
 lifting devices and each piece


769
0:46:15,933 --> 0:46:19,233
 is removed and transported
 to a detailing area for any


770
0:46:19,233 --> 0:46:22,233
 minor cosmetic touch-ups.


771
0:46:22,233 --> 0:46:25,2
 Also at this time, the QC
 Department does a post-pour


772
0:46:25,2 --> 0:46:30,2
 QC check on each piece that is
 brought to the detailing area.


773
0:46:30,2 --> 0:46:32,8
 When I first get back there,
 I go and check the length


774
0:46:32,8 --> 0:46:36,167
 of the piece and verify that
 within, oh there's a tolerance


775
0:46:36,167 --> 0:46:38,633
 of a quarter inch or so.


776
0:46:38,633 --> 0:46:41,2
 Check the width, we check
 the vectors, we check the


777
0:46:41,2 --> 0:46:43,2
 electrical block-outs.


778
0:46:43,2 --> 0:46:46,833
 I do a visual for any type of
 discoloration in the stems


779
0:46:46,833 --> 0:46:51,367
 underneath the piece, any type
 of surface cracks, bug holes,


780
0:46:51,367 --> 0:46:54,0
 just do a complete visual.


781
0:46:54,0 --> 0:46:55,533
 >> narrator:
 Any defects are noted so that


782
0:46:55,533 --> 0:47:0,67
 repairs can be done
 before shipping the tee.


783
0:47:0,67 --> 0:47:2,9
After all the work is completed,
 the double tees are moved into


784
0:47:2,9 --> 0:47:5,433
the storage area where they are
 typically stacked using


785
0:47:5,433 --> 0:47:10,333
 appropriate dunage,
 located near the ends.


786
0:47:10,333 --> 0:47:13,33
 When the job site requires
 the tee to be shipped, it is


787
0:47:13,33 --> 0:47:17,833
 loaded on a trailer and
 transported to the job site.


788
0:47:17,833 --> 0:47:20,667
 What you have just observed
 is the process for making


789
0:47:20,667 --> 0:47:23,567
 one type of
 prestressed product.


790
0:47:23,567 --> 0:47:27,6
These other types are made using
 essentially the same process.


791
0:47:27,6 --> 0:47:30,8
 Hollow-core plank, which are
 used for floor and roof


792
0:47:30,8 --> 0:47:34,5
 components in multi-family
 housing, schools, hotels,


793
0:47:34,5 --> 0:47:36,5
 and many other buildings.


794
0:47:36,5 --> 0:47:39,467
 Inverted tee beams, which
 can be used in any total


795
0:47:39,467 --> 0:47:42,667
 precast concrete build system.


796
0:47:42,667 --> 0:47:46,433
 Columns, which are cast
 horizontally and then rotated


797
0:47:46,433 --> 0:47:48,867
 in the air at the job site.


798
0:47:48,867 --> 0:47:53,467
 They are often designed as
 prestressed components.


799
0:47:53,467 --> 0:47:56,9
Architectural spandrels, used in
 office buildings and parking


800
0:47:56,9 --> 0:48:1,1
 structures, can be made using
 the prestressing process.


801
0:48:1,1 --> 0:48:4,733
 Deck slabs and box beams,
 which are used primarily in


802
0:48:4,733 --> 0:48:8,133
 short-span bridge
 construction.


803
0:48:8,133 --> 0:48:10,8
 Standard AASHTO girders,
 which are used in


804
0:48:10,8 --> 0:48:14,133
 long-span bridge
 construction.


805
0:48:14,133 --> 0:48:16,967
 Standard bulb tees
 are also used in


806
0:48:16,967 --> 0:48:20,733
 long-span bridge
 construction.


807
0:48:20,733 --> 0:48:24,67
 Prestressed piles that support
 any type of building in areas


808
0:48:24,67 --> 0:48:28,433
 that have unfavorable
 soil conditions.


809
0:48:28,433 --> 0:48:30,1
 As you can see, there
 are many types of


810
0:48:30,1 --> 0:48:32,333
 prestressed products
 available.


811
0:48:32,333 --> 0:48:34,9
 The variety of products that
 can be prestressed in a


812
0:48:34,9 --> 0:48:38,267
 long line operation is almost
 unlimited and is up to the


813
0:48:38,267 --> 0:48:41,867
 imagination of the
 design professional.


814
0:48:41,867 --> 0:48:45,4
 We really do encourage our
 customers and architects and


815
0:48:45,4 --> 0:48:50,3
 engineers to get to our
 plants to really understand


816
0:48:50,3 --> 0:48:52,7
 how precast concrete is made.


817
0:48:52,7 --> 0:48:56,33
 They need an understanding of
 the high quality that they can


818
0:48:56,33 --> 0:49:0,4
get out of precast concrete, as
 opposed to the random quality


819
0:49:0,4 --> 0:49:3,67
 that you might get out of
 cast-in-place concrete.


820
0:49:3,67 --> 0:49:7,4
Well, it's important that we do
things as efficiently as we can


821
0:49:7,4 --> 0:49:11,433
 and as cost-effectively as we
can, but also as well as we can.


822
0:49:11,433 --> 0:49:14,267
 And it's not only my
 responsibility, but the


823
0:49:14,267 --> 0:49:16,9
 responsibility of everybody
 here--management, labor,


824
0:49:16,9 --> 0:49:20,33
 everybody included--to do the
 best job that they can to,


825
0:49:20,33 --> 0:49:23,233
 at the end of the day, make a
 little bit of money, but also


826
0:49:23,233 --> 0:49:26,967
 have a customer that is very
 happy and will possibly want


827
0:49:26,967 --> 0:49:30,533
 to have some return work
 coming back our way.


828
0:49:30,533 --> 0:49:40,767
[no dialogue].


829
0:49:40,767 --> 0:49:42,2
>> Ms. McIntyre:
You'll see a very different


830
0:49:42,2 --> 0:49:46,8
plant when you go to see
Lombard Architectual, but


831
0:49:46,8 --> 0:49:51,6
that gives you an idea of the
process that you go through.


832
0:49:51,6 --> 0:49:54,0
One of the things that you saw
there was the prestressing


833
0:49:54,0 --> 0:49:57,33
operation, and I just
thought I'd show you some


834
0:49:57,33 --> 0:49:59,7
samples of prestressing steel.


835
0:49:59,7 --> 0:50:3,1
So, you know, like they
mentioned, they'll pull this


836
0:50:3,1 --> 0:50:7,733
at three or four kips with
40,000, 50,000 psi, and it


837
0:50:7,733 --> 0:50:11,633
does have that ability
to stretch and give.


838
0:50:11,633 --> 0:50:14,1
They place the concrete
in, the concrete then


839
0:50:14,1 --> 0:50:16,867
adheres to that strand.


840
0:50:16,867 --> 0:50:20,967
After it cures they'll cut
either end, and then you'll


841
0:50:20,967 --> 0:50:27,833
have an arch or a camber in the
beam or wall that you have, and


842
0:50:27,833 --> 0:50:32,0
that's going to help counteract
any loads that are placed on it.


843
0:50:32,0 --> 0:50:33,9
>> Dr. Wahby:
[unclear audio].


844
0:50:33,9 --> 0:50:35,633
>> Ms. McIntyre:
Oh, okay, you've got a--


845
0:50:35,633 --> 0:50:37,233
>> Dr. Wahby:
[unclear audio].


846
0:50:37,233 --> 0:50:39,0
>> Ms. McIntyre:
Okay, here's a typical rebar so


847
0:50:39,0 --> 0:50:43,7
you can see the difference,
you know, that doesn't have


848
0:50:43,7 --> 0:50:46,467
that same ability.


849
0:50:46,467 --> 0:50:49,767
>> Dr. Wahby:
[unlcear audio].


850
0:50:49,767 --> 0:50:51,433
>> Ms. McIntyre:
Yeah.


851
0:50:51,433 --> 0:51:2,867
[no dialogue].


852
0:51:2,867 --> 0:51:4,733
>> male speaker:
Yeah, I was just curious what


853
0:51:4,733 --> 0:51:7,333
you do with the piece of
concrete deemed unusable,


854
0:51:7,333 --> 0:51:9,433
like after it's already made?


855
0:51:9,433 --> 0:51:11,467
>> Ms. McIntyre:
Well, most of the time they


856
0:51:11,467 --> 0:51:15,7
try not to have it
be unusable.


857
0:51:15,7 --> 0:51:18,633
Every once in awhile a bridge
beam or something like that


858
0:51:18,633 --> 0:51:21,8
will be rejected by the DOT,
and usually then it's just


859
0:51:21,8 --> 0:51:25,633
crushed and used as road base
or something like that.


860
0:51:25,633 --> 0:51:31,3
But by that point, they've got
$30,000 or $40,000, you know,


861
0:51:31,3 --> 0:51:35,0
for some of those bridge beams
especially, invested in it.


862
0:51:35,0 --> 0:51:38,667
So, they really try to
do everything right or


863
0:51:38,667 --> 0:51:48,367
fix it in some manner.


864
0:51:48,367 --> 0:51:50,2
>> male speaker:
I was just looking at your


865
0:51:50,2 --> 0:51:52,533
prestressed wires, it's
seven cords in it,


866
0:51:52,533 --> 0:51:54,3
does that ever change?


867
0:51:54,3 --> 0:51:56,767
>> Ms. McIntyre:
No, the size might change.


868
0:51:56,767 --> 0:52:3,633
You might go anywhere from 3/8
of an inch to 3/4 of an inch,


869
0:52:3,633 --> 0:52:9,367
but you always have the
seven wires still in it.


870
0:52:9,367 --> 0:52:10,467
>> male speaker:
Okay, all right.


871
0:52:10,467 --> 0:52:11,767
>> Ms. McIntyre:
And I have no idea


872
0:52:11,767 --> 0:52:13,0
why it's seven.


873
0:52:13,0 --> 0:52:14,3
>> male speaker:
That's, I just, okay, I didn't


874
0:52:14,3 --> 0:52:16,167
know if it was, they
don't add more wire,


875
0:52:16,167 --> 0:52:18,0
they just change
the size?


876
0:52:18,0 --> 0:52:19,933
>> Ms. McIntyre:
They just make it bigger, yeah.


877
0:52:19,933 --> 0:52:21,233
>> Dr. Wahby:
Typically you have the


878
0:52:21,233 --> 0:52:23,633
middle one and then the
others braid around it.


879
0:52:23,633 --> 0:52:25,5
>> Ms. McIntyre:
The six wrap around it, yeah.


880
0:52:25,5 --> 0:52:26,733
>> Dr. Wahby:
But tell us something about


881
0:52:26,733 --> 0:52:29,233
the material, it's different
material than the rebars.


882
0:52:29,233 --> 0:52:34,567
The feel itself is different,
it has higher inside strength


883
0:52:34,567 --> 0:52:37,167
and higher [unclear audio].


884
0:52:37,167 --> 0:52:41,9
So it's really different
material, kind of steel,


885
0:52:41,9 --> 0:52:43,4
different type of steel.


886
0:52:43,4 --> 0:52:46,7
You cannot take the rebar
and stretch it like this.


887
0:52:46,7 --> 0:52:50,133
>> Ms. McIntyre:
Yeah.


888
0:52:50,133 --> 0:52:55,0
Any other questions?


889
0:52:55,0 --> 0:52:56,6
>> Dr. Wahby:
I have a question for you


890
0:52:56,6 --> 0:53:3,367
regarding the magic formula for
holding one piece, big or small.


891
0:53:3,367 --> 0:53:7,833
There's a formula for per piece
thing, if you use your trucks.


892
0:53:7,833 --> 0:53:9,633
>> Ms. McIntyre:
Oh, how much you can


893
0:53:9,633 --> 0:53:11,0
put on a truck?


894
0:53:11,0 --> 0:53:13,0
>> Dr. Wahby:
No, I mean if you have a


895
0:53:13,0 --> 0:53:15,0
small piece or large piece.


896
0:53:15,0 --> 0:53:16,667
>> Ms. McIntyre:
Oh, yeah.


897
0:53:16,667 --> 0:53:20,533
I talk about that a lot with
designers because every time


898
0:53:20,533 --> 0:53:24,433
you pick up, to get precast on
a building, you have to have


899
0:53:24,433 --> 0:53:26,967
one key thing and
that's a crane.


900
0:53:26,967 --> 0:53:29,9
And you have to have a crane
that's going to be able to lift


901
0:53:29,9 --> 0:53:33,6
the lagest piece of precast
that you have on that job.


902
0:53:33,6 --> 0:53:38,367
So that's kind of going to be
the crane that you're going to


903
0:53:38,367 --> 0:53:40,433
go with for the whole project.


904
0:53:40,433 --> 0:53:44,133
So then every time you pick up a
piece off a truck and put it on


905
0:53:44,133 --> 0:53:48,67
a building, you're going to pay
what we call the "pick price".


906
0:53:48,67 --> 0:53:51,367
And the pick price is going to
be for the use of that crane.


907
0:53:51,367 --> 0:53:55,33
So the crane doesn't really
care what size it is,


908
0:53:55,33 --> 0:53:56,933
you're still going
to have to pay.


909
0:53:56,933 --> 0:54:2,167
If you're in downtown Chicago,
it might be $1500 every time


910
0:54:2,167 --> 0:54:4,433
you pick up a piece and
put it on a building.


911
0:54:4,433 --> 0:54:8,1
So if you have a one-by-ten
column cover, you've now added


912
0:54:8,1 --> 0:54:13,67
$150 per square foot to
put it on the building.


913
0:54:13,67 --> 0:54:17,933
So, in general, larger pieces
are going to be less expensive.


914
0:54:17,933 --> 0:54:21,733
You don't want to have a
building full of small pieces


915
0:54:21,733 --> 0:54:25,267
of precast because you're going
to have to pay that pick price.


916
0:54:25,267 --> 0:54:29,233
And it would also take longer
to erect the building as well.


917
0:54:29,233 --> 0:54:31,733
>> Dr. Wahby:
So these two advices you give,


918
0:54:31,733 --> 0:54:34,667
the repetition of the piece.


919
0:54:34,667 --> 0:54:35,867
>> Ms. McIntyre:
Right.


920
0:54:35,867 --> 0:54:37,33
>> Dr. Wahby:
You make many of it.


921
0:54:37,33 --> 0:54:38,267
>> Ms. McIntyre:
Right.


922
0:54:38,267 --> 0:54:39,333
>> Dr. Wahby:
And as large as possible.


923
0:54:39,333 --> 0:54:40,7
>> Ms. McIntyre:
Right.


924
0:54:40,7 --> 0:54:42,567
In general, larger is going
to be less expensive, and


925
0:54:42,567 --> 0:54:44,933
then the repetition is
going to be important.


926
0:54:44,933 --> 0:54:47,5
You saw how everything's
cast in a long line bed.


927
0:54:47,5 --> 0:54:50,933
You want all of your strands
lined up the same way so


928
0:54:50,933 --> 0:54:54,233
piece after piece the strand
pattern will be the same,


929
0:54:54,233 --> 0:54:56,933
because every piece has to
be engineered for that


930
0:54:56,933 --> 0:54:59,33
specific project
that you're doing.


931
0:54:59,33 --> 0:55:2,67
Even though you're using
the same, you know, notes


932
0:55:2,67 --> 0:55:6,733
on the keyboard, you still
have to engineer it or


933
0:55:6,733 --> 0:55:9,167
compose it in a different way.


934
0:55:9,167 --> 0:55:12,6
So absolutely, you want to
create as much repetition


935
0:55:12,6 --> 0:55:15,5
and use the same pieces
over and over again.


936
0:55:15,5 --> 0:55:19,6
And then, those are going to
be the two biggest factors


937
0:55:19,6 --> 0:55:21,8
in the cost of the precast.


938
0:55:21,8 --> 0:55:24,0
One is the size of the pieces.


939
0:55:24,0 --> 0:55:29,0
The other is the amount of
repetition that you have.


940
0:55:29,0 --> 0:55:31,7
>> Dr. Wahby:
Any other questions?


941
0:55:31,7 --> 0:55:34,6
I have a question regarding
some tips or tricks of trade


942
0:55:34,6 --> 0:55:38,1
that they would do for an
extremely long piece, the


943
0:55:38,1 --> 0:55:41,833
longest piece they can have,
how do they transport it?


944
0:55:41,833 --> 0:55:46,567
Or, if it is tall, how
do they manipulate it?


945
0:55:46,567 --> 0:55:48,933
>> Ms. McIntyre:
Well, with the longer pieces,


946
0:55:48,933 --> 0:55:51,33
like with that, I was
talking about that bridge


947
0:55:51,33 --> 0:55:53,6
where it was 176 feet.


948
0:55:53,6 --> 0:55:58,933
You really start using the
piece of precast as kind of


949
0:55:58,933 --> 0:56:0,567
the bed of the truck.


950
0:56:0,567 --> 0:56:3,8
Then you don't actually have a
truck bed, you'll have wheels


951
0:56:3,8 --> 0:56:7,133
on the front and then another
column of wheels on the back


952
0:56:7,133 --> 0:56:12,0
and then usually, the driver
will have a steering component


953
0:56:12,0 --> 0:56:15,6
to actually steer the back
wheels from the truck or


954
0:56:15,6 --> 0:56:17,867
the cab of the truck.


955
0:56:17,867 --> 0:56:22,3
So, you know, then you'll get
it to the ground that way.


956
0:56:22,3 --> 0:56:25,5
And then, also, as I mentioned,
when you're erecting precast


957
0:56:25,5 --> 0:56:28,9
you always want to handle
it from the two ends.


958
0:56:28,9 --> 0:56:30,967
You never really want to
handle it from the middle


959
0:56:30,967 --> 0:56:33,33
because it can snap.


960
0:56:33,33 --> 0:56:41,2
So, the precaster will do all of
the engineering for the pieces


961
0:56:41,2 --> 0:56:46,5
of precast because when you
handle it, that's going to be


962
0:56:46,5 --> 0:56:49,1
when the most pressure is
actually going to be applied


963
0:56:49,1 --> 0:56:54,33
to a piece of precast, not when
it's in place in the building.


964
0:56:54,33 --> 0:56:56,5
It's all of the handling
that goes into it.


965
0:56:56,5 --> 0:56:59,333
So the precaster likes to do
all of the engineering of


966
0:56:59,333 --> 0:57:2,8
his own pieces and all of
the connection details.


967
0:57:2,8 --> 0:57:3,833
>> Dr. Wahby:
Thanks.


968
0:57:3,833 --> 0:57:6,733
Now, you gave us your
definition for precast.


969
0:57:6,733 --> 0:57:9,4
What is the definition
for prestressed?


970
0:57:9,4 --> 0:57:11,6
Pre- to what?


971
0:57:11,6 --> 0:57:13,767
>> Ms. McIntyre:
The prestressed is what uses


972
0:57:13,767 --> 0:57:18,33
those prestressing steel
and you've got that steel


973
0:57:18,33 --> 0:57:19,6
within the piece.


974
0:57:19,6 --> 0:57:23,333
So precast is any kind,
prestressed concrete is


975
0:57:23,333 --> 0:57:26,567
also precast concrete,
but precast concrete is


976
0:57:26,567 --> 0:57:28,9
not necessarily prestressed.


977
0:57:28,9 --> 0:57:32,667
Usually, prestressed concrete
are pieces that are longer,


978
0:57:32,667 --> 0:57:37,0
that require more load
placed on them, or maybe


979
0:57:37,0 --> 0:57:39,1
they'are structural pieces.


980
0:57:39,1 --> 0:57:43,133
But the prestressing is what
allows you to actually use


981
0:57:43,133 --> 0:57:48,567
less of the concrete material
without losing any strength


982
0:57:48,567 --> 0:57:50,767
or by gaining strength.


983
0:57:50,767 --> 0:57:53,3
>> Dr. Wahby:
And the "pre" term time-wise


984
0:57:53,3 --> 0:57:57,6
reflects to the pouring of
concrete, so you are actually


985
0:57:57,6 --> 0:58:0,9
stressing the steel of
the strands before.


986
0:58:0,9 --> 0:58:2,233
>> Ms. McIntyre:
Before you place the concrete


987
0:58:2,233 --> 0:58:3,5
in the form.


988
0:58:3,5 --> 0:58:4,667
>> Dr Wahby:
So hence, the term "pre-"


989
0:58:4,667 --> 0:58:5,867
for stressing.


990
0:58:5,867 --> 0:58:7,267
>> Ms. McIntyre:
Well, you could also do


991
0:58:7,267 --> 0:58:11,167
post-tensioning which is,
sometimes you see precast


992
0:58:11,167 --> 0:58:12,433
done with that.


993
0:58:12,433 --> 0:58:14,167
You don't see a whole lot
of it done in this area,


994
0:58:14,167 --> 0:58:17,267
and they would create a
sleeve, the precaster would


995
0:58:17,267 --> 0:58:20,6
create a sleeve within
the precast product.


996
0:58:20,6 --> 0:58:24,167
Then it would go out to the
job site and be stressed


997
0:58:24,167 --> 0:58:27,433
at the job site and then
grouted into place there.


998
0:58:27,433 --> 0:58:30,667
You could get your
tension that way without


999
0:58:30,667 --> 0:58:33,167
stressing it at the plant.


1000
0:58:33,167 --> 0:58:36,5
So really, it's a function of
stressing it at the plant versus


1001
0:58:36,5 --> 0:58:40,67
stressing it at the job site.


1002
0:58:40,67 --> 0:58:43,167
>> Dr. Wahby:
What would make an owner


1003
0:58:43,167 --> 0:58:48,7
or engineer or architect choose
prestressed or precast over


1004
0:58:48,7 --> 0:58:51,9
other post-tension
or other types?


1005
0:58:51,9 --> 0:58:54,333
>> Ms. McIntyre:
Well, one of it is what's


1006
0:58:54,333 --> 0:58:59,633
commonly used in your area,
but we usually can provide


1007
0:58:59,633 --> 0:59:3,933
something much faster than
other types of products if


1008
0:59:3,933 --> 0:59:6,133
you were casting
something in place.


1009
0:59:6,133 --> 0:59:13,467
Sometimes it's fire
prevention, fire ratings


1010
0:59:13,467 --> 0:59:15,4
are going to be important.


1011
0:59:15,4 --> 0:59:18,0
The city of Chicago loves
concrete because they're


1012
0:59:18,0 --> 0:59:20,33
real funny about fire.


1013
0:59:20,33 --> 0:59:26,3
So, you know, sometimes it's
the needs of the project.


1014
0:59:26,3 --> 0:59:30,7
Sometimes it's how fast is it
going to go up, sometimes it's


1015
0:59:30,7 --> 0:59:33,367
what does it look like.


1016
0:59:33,367 --> 0:59:37,633
But usually it's faster,
cheaper, better, you know,


1017
0:59:37,633 --> 0:59:40,867
the quality of the concrete
is going to be a little bit


1018
0:59:40,867 --> 0:59:44,467
better, too, because they're
using very low water-cement


1019
0:59:44,467 --> 0:59:47,7
ratio because they want to
turn those beds over and


1020
0:59:47,7 --> 0:59:50,567
start casting the beds
again the next day.


1021
0:59:50,567 --> 0:59:55,33
So, you know, that's going to
be, that's going to be key.


1022
0:59:55,33 --> 0:59:57,2
>> Dr. Wahby:
Talk about money and jobs.


1023
0:59:57,2 --> 0:59:58,8
>> Ms. McIntyre:
Okay.


1024
0:59:58,8 --> 1:0:1,567
>> Dr. Wahby:
In a normal economic situation,


1025
1:0:1,567 --> 1:0:4,5
not now, normal situation.


1026
1:0:4,5 --> 1:0:7,4
What is average salary,
what are the jobs,


1027
1:0:7,4 --> 1:0:9,8
what would our graduates do?


1028
1:0:9,8 --> 1:0:13,4
Would be working in concreting,
or managers, or what?


1029
1:0:13,4 --> 1:0:15,7
>> Ms. McIntyre:
Yeah, we have, our industry


1030
1:0:15,7 --> 1:0:20,933
does a few things where
they see graduates.


1031
1:0:20,933 --> 1:0:25,133
Sometimes they're project
managers, where they come in


1032
1:0:25,133 --> 1:0:27,767
and they'll supervise the
drawings and kind of,


1033
1:0:27,767 --> 1:0:32,367
after the salesman gets the
project in, you would supervise


1034
1:0:32,367 --> 1:0:36,3
getting the drawings done,
communicating with the client,


1035
1:0:36,3 --> 1:0:39,933
making sure that the product
gets to where it needs to be


1036
1:0:39,933 --> 1:0:46,233
when it needs to be there,
making sure that the materials


1037
1:0:46,233 --> 1:0:51,1
are ordered for the products
that you're going to make,


1038
1:0:51,1 --> 1:0:53,467
when they need to happen.


1039
1:0:53,467 --> 1:0:58,1
So that could be a job.


1040
1:0:58,1 --> 1:1:2,833
We also work with a lot of
erectors, companies that erect


1041
1:1:2,833 --> 1:1:5,4
both steel and pre-cast, and
you could be a certified


1042
1:1:5,4 --> 1:1:11,33
pre-cast erector and again,
project manager-type jobs


1043
1:1:11,33 --> 1:1:16,967
and, you know, supervising
work like that.


1044
1:1:16,967 --> 1:1:21,433
Marketing, I know a lot of
people who've gone into sales


1045
1:1:21,433 --> 1:1:25,33
and marketing with a good
construction background and,


1046
1:1:25,33 --> 1:1:29,167
you know, then work selling
the pre-cast products.


1047
1:1:29,167 --> 1:1:32,933
But usually you work
your way up through a


1048
1:1:32,933 --> 1:1:35,7
pre-stressing plant
to a sales job.


1049
1:1:35,7 --> 1:1:38,67
Those are usually some of the
better-paying jobs, so I think


1050
1:1:38,67 --> 1:1:42,333
a lot of people like to
work their way into those.


1051
1:1:42,333 --> 1:1:46,833
And, you know, some of our
plants are union plants and


1052
1:1:46,833 --> 1:1:52,767
some are not, so salaries
really vary different places.


1053
1:1:52,767 --> 1:2:0,333
But there's also, you saw
the quality assurance guy


1054
1:2:0,333 --> 1:2:5,567
doing that, and sometimes they
come up through the ranks or


1055
1:2:5,567 --> 1:2:9,5
sometimes they'll bring
people in to do that.


1056
1:2:9,5 --> 1:2:13,467
Engineering firms, there's a
lot of drafting that goes on


1057
1:2:13,467 --> 1:2:19,367
using, usually, some kind of
computer-aided design system.


1058
1:2:19,367 --> 1:2:25,733
So we have drafters that draft
all the different pieces


1059
1:2:25,733 --> 1:2:28,3
after the engineers
design them.


1060
1:2:28,3 --> 1:2:29,967
>> Dr. Wahby:
Now, if somebody is lucky to


1061
1:2:29,967 --> 1:2:33,4
end up working for a plant,
what is the magic number


1062
1:2:33,4 --> 1:2:35,1
for average salary?


1063
1:2:35,1 --> 1:2:37,633
>> Ms. McIntyre:
You know what, I have no idea.


1064
1:2:37,633 --> 1:2:38,9
>> Dr. Wahby:
Okay.


1065
1:2:38,9 --> 1:2:41,67
>> Ms. McIntyre:
I don't know.


1066
1:2:41,67 --> 1:2:43,133
>> Dr. Wahby:
I'll get you another question,


1067
1:2:43,133 --> 1:2:44,533
easy one.


1068
1:2:44,533 --> 1:2:47,433
What is relationship between the
PCI that you mentioned earlier


1069
1:2:47,433 --> 1:2:49,367
and whatever you said now.


1070
1:2:49,367 --> 1:2:51,367
PCI, what is PCI?


1071
1:2:51,367 --> 1:2:52,633
>> Ms. McIntyre:
PCI is the Pre-cast


1072
1:2:52,633 --> 1:2:56,467
Pre-stressed Concrete
Institute, and I work for


1073
1:2:56,467 --> 1:2:58,6
the Illinois-Wisconsin region.


1074
1:2:58,6 --> 1:3:0,5
So, is that what you
were asking?


1075
1:3:0,5 --> 1:3:2,4
>> Dr. Wahby:
They inspect the plants?


1076
1:3:2,4 --> 1:3:3,733
>> Ms. McIntyre:
Oh, yes.


1077
1:3:3,733 --> 1:3:7,633
They have, I'm sorry, the
plants that are members of PCI


1078
1:3:7,633 --> 1:3:10,733
have to be PCI-certified plants,
and that means that twice


1079
1:3:10,733 --> 1:3:14,6
a year an inspector comes to
the plant and checks all


1080
1:3:14,6 --> 1:3:16,833
of the quality
assurance manuals.


1081
1:3:16,833 --> 1:3:20,467
He makes sure that all of the
equipment's calibrated, how do


1082
1:3:20,467 --> 1:3:23,833
you store your materials, how
do you train your workers,


1083
1:3:23,833 --> 1:3:26,33
how do you deal with
your customers.


1084
1:3:26,33 --> 1:3:30,0
And twice a year he spends two
days at the plant ensuring that


1085
1:3:30,0 --> 1:3:33,933
they meet all of those
quality issues.


1086
1:3:33,933 --> 1:3:35,633
>> Dr. Wahby:
Unannounced, unannounced.


1087
1:3:35,633 --> 1:3:38,67
>> Ms. McIntyre:
Unannounced, yes, yes.


1088
1:3:38,67 --> 1:3:39,667
>> Dr. Wahby:
Okay, very good.


1089
1:3:39,667 --> 1:3:42,333
I think I'll stop asking here
questions, but I'll ask the


1090
1:3:42,333 --> 1:3:46,633
audience the last question, and
whoever answers this question,


1091
1:3:46,633 --> 1:3:50,9
I'll give him a chocolate,
how about that?


1092
1:3:50,9 --> 1:3:55,633
If you can guess, what is the
major of Marty McIntyre?


1093
1:3:55,633 --> 1:3:59,633
You saw how professional she is
in concrete and so forth.


1094
1:3:59,633 --> 1:4:1,233
What do you think?


1095
1:4:1,233 --> 1:4:3,0
Please, if you know
it from before,


1096
1:4:3,0 --> 1:4:5,167
you don't qualify for that.


1097
1:4:5,167 --> 1:4:8,0
But guess what was her major
when she was undergrad.


1098
1:4:8,0 --> 1:4:11,3
Any guess?
Chocolate?


1099
1:4:11,3 --> 1:4:12,733
>> male speaker:
Speech communication.


1100
1:4:12,733 --> 1:4:13,867
>> Dr. Wahby:
Speech communication,


1101
1:4:13,867 --> 1:4:15,3
she is good with that,
very good.


1102
1:4:15,3 --> 1:4:16,733
>> Ms. McIntyre:
No, it wasn't that.


1103
1:4:16,733 --> 1:4:18,0
>> Dr. Wahby:
She is talented.


1104
1:4:18,0 --> 1:4:22,0
Now, I tell Marty, I tell Marty
that she is a role model


1105
1:4:22,0 --> 1:4:24,33
for a successful person.


1106
1:4:24,33 --> 1:4:27,633
She will tell you where she
started and where she is now,


1107
1:4:27,633 --> 1:4:32,733
and this is a story of success
and it's inspired many students


1108
1:4:32,733 --> 1:4:36,9
in the past to change careers,
drastically, and be successful


1109
1:4:36,9 --> 1:4:38,233
wherever they are.


1110
1:4:38,233 --> 1:4:39,7
So bloom wherever you are.


1111
1:4:39,7 --> 1:4:41,67
So what is your major?


1112
1:4:41,67 --> 1:4:43,167
>> Ms. McIntyre:
My major was English literature


1113
1:4:43,167 --> 1:4:46,2
with an emphasis in
journalism.


1114
1:4:46,2 --> 1:4:49,1
>> Dr. Wahby:
Okay, so you speak English.


1115
1:4:49,1 --> 1:4:51,0
>> Ms. McIntyre:
And then I got out of school


1116
1:4:51,0 --> 1:4:54,0
and I was doing marketing
for architecture firms,


1117
1:4:54,0 --> 1:4:56,333
or for an architecture firm.


1118
1:4:56,333 --> 1:4:59,833
And I decided I wanted to write
more, so I went and worked for


1119
1:4:59,833 --> 1:5:2,267
"Roads and Bridges" magazine.


1120
1:5:2,267 --> 1:5:5,733
And then I worked for the
"Concrete Producer" magazine.


1121
1:5:5,733 --> 1:5:9,367
And then I worked for the
Portland Cement Association.


1122
1:5:9,367 --> 1:5:11,8
And now I work for PCI.


1123
1:5:11,8 --> 1:7:11,8
[no dialogue].
