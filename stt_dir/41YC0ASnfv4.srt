0:0:9,3 --> 0:0:11,82
NARRATOR: In February of 2012,
university and college


5
0:0:11,82 --> 0:0:14,8
students in Quebec began
striking against the 75%


6
0:0:14,8 --> 0:0:17,49
proposed tuition hike.


7
0:0:17,49 --> 0:0:20,23
Since the Quiet Revolution in
the '60s, low tuition rates


8
0:0:20,23 --> 0:0:21,93
have been part of the socialist
package deal


9
0:0:21,93 --> 0:0:23,26
promised to Quebecers.


10
0:0:23,26 --> 0:0:26,2
For student protesters, a
doubling of current rates


11
0:0:26,2 --> 0:0:27,93
represents a complete
abandonment of the fundamental


12
0:0:27,93 --> 0:0:30,22
ideals of their education
system.


13
0:0:30,22 --> 0:0:32,685
To make matters worse, critics
see the increase as being more


14
0:0:32,685 --> 0:0:35,18
to do with corruption than the
spending within government,


15
0:0:35,18 --> 0:0:37,706
especially since Quebec has the
highest income taxes in


16
0:0:37,706 --> 0:0:39,33
the country.


17
0:0:39,33 --> 0:0:41,29
Instead of balancing the books
by attacking pensions and


18
0:0:41,29 --> 0:0:44,35
corporations, the government
has seemingly attacked the


19
0:0:44,35 --> 0:0:46,53
weakest demographic
in the province.


20
0:0:46,53 --> 0:0:49,14
Alienation and apathy has made
the movement a rallying point


21
0:0:49,14 --> 0:0:51,24
for youth to rebel against
a mostly non-responsive


22
0:0:51,24 --> 0:0:53,455
government, led by their
Premier, Jean Charest.

24
0:0:54,705 --> 0:1:12,31



25
0:1:12,31 --> 0:1:14,76
NARRATOR: Faced with fewer jobs,
mounting personal debt,


26
0:1:14,76 --> 0:1:17,9
and the prospect of an aging
boomer generation sucking


27
0:1:17,9 --> 0:1:18,81
public coffers dry,
and you have a


28
0:1:18,81 --> 0:1:21,88
recipe for civil unrest.


29
0:1:21,88 --> 0:1:24,163
Some romantic types are even
calling this Quebec's Spring.


30
0:1:24,163 --> 0:1:27,38



31
0:1:27,38 --> 0:1:29,96
Things seemed destined to come
to a head on May Day, as


32
0:1:29,96 --> 0:1:32,17
student unions were set to join
other workers groups and


33
0:1:32,17 --> 0:1:34,75
the infamous anarchist black
bloc in a crowd of close to


34
0:1:34,75 --> 0:1:36,61
10,000 behind Montreal
City Hall.


35
0:1:36,61 --> 0:1:40,12



36
0:1:40,12 --> 0:1:42,9
MARIE: May Day has a long
revolutionary tradition.


37
0:1:42,9 --> 0:1:45,16
And we want to remind that
to our [INAUDIBLE].


38
0:1:45,16 --> 0:1:49,315
It's about decent housing,
decent lives, decent jobs.


39
0:1:49,315 --> 0:1:52,12
And it's about having people
before profits.

42
0:2:7,93 --> 0:2:9,56
NARRATOR: Once the spirited
crowd took off, French


43
0:2:9,56 --> 0:2:11,75
anti-capitalists and "fuck
the police" chants were


44
0:2:11,75 --> 0:2:14,136
everywhere, while some talked
of riot squads.

0:2:35,72 --> 0:2:37,245
NARRATOR: Eventually, they
made their way to Saint


47
0:2:37,245 --> 0:2:39,84
Catherine Street, the heart of
downtown Montreal, where after


48
0:2:39,84 --> 0:2:42,54
one window was broken,
everything completely devolved


49
0:2:42,54 --> 0:2:43,823
into chaos.

58
0:4:17,508 --> 0:4:22,98



59
0:4:22,98 --> 0:4:24,92
NARRATOR: After an hour-long
skirmish between cops and


60
0:4:24,92 --> 0:4:28,13
protesters, everyone regrouped
in a downtown park to prepare


61
0:4:28,13 --> 0:4:29,735
for a night march.


62
0:4:29,735 --> 0:4:32,96
STUDENT: It turned
pretty violent.


63
0:4:32,96 --> 0:4:34,311
People throwing rocks
and stuff.


64
0:4:34,311 --> 0:4:36,99
It was predictable, kind of.


65
0:4:36,99 --> 0:4:38,78
Tonight, I don't know.


66
0:4:38,78 --> 0:4:40,3
So far, it's been
pretty peaceful.


67
0:4:40,3 --> 0:4:43,119
I've been to a lot of
demonstration at night, and it


68
0:4:43,119 --> 0:4:44,369
was peaceful.


69
0:4:44,369 --> 0:4:49,78



70
0:4:49,78 --> 0:4:51,51
STUDENT: Every week, I think
the end is here.


71
0:4:51,51 --> 0:4:55,948
Because every week, I see that
the movement is very strong.


72
0:4:55,948 --> 0:4:58,43
But now I'm not sure.


73
0:4:58,43 --> 0:4:58,965
It's long.


74
0:4:58,965 --> 0:5:0,7
It's hard.


75
0:5:0,7 --> 0:5:3,4
But like you can see,
it's not over.


76
0:5:3,4 --> 0:5:3,94
It's not over.


77
0:5:3,94 --> 0:5:7,54
So there's no reason that
we're going to stop now.


78
0:5:7,54 --> 0:5:8,67
There's just no reason.


79
0:5:8,67 --> 0:5:10,946
You have to fight if
you want something.


80
0:5:10,946 --> 0:5:13,23
You have to fight.


81
0:5:13,23 --> 0:5:15,4
NARRATOR: By the end of the
day, over 100 people were


82
0:5:15,4 --> 0:5:18,12
arrested, with almost as
many hospitalized.


83
0:5:18,12 --> 0:5:20,37
And since May Day, things
have only gotten worse.


84
0:5:20,37 --> 0:5:24,8



85
0:5:24,8 --> 0:5:26,28
Small towns have turned into
temporary war zones.


86
0:5:26,28 --> 0:5:28,37
There's been smoke bombs in
the Montreal metro system.


87
0:5:28,37 --> 0:5:30,2
And clashes between
riot squads and


88
0:5:30,2 --> 0:5:33,32
protesters are daily.


89
0:5:33,32 --> 0:5:35,8
MAYOR TREMBLAY: What do
you want me to do?


90
0:5:35,8 --> 0:5:37,12
Are we going to stop living?


91
0:5:37,12 --> 0:5:38,29
NARRATOR: The Quebec government
even enacted a


92
0:5:38,29 --> 0:5:40,79
draconian anti-protest
law, Bill 78.


93
0:5:40,79 --> 0:5:42,69
Which has only served to
galvanize movement, and


94
0:5:42,69 --> 0:5:45,22
attract even more followers
from all over the world,


95
0:5:45,22 --> 0:5:47,975
including the vigilante hacker
group, Anonymous.


96
0:5:47,975 --> 0:5:50,85
The protest shows no signs
of slowing down.


97
0:5:50,85 --> 0:5:53,77
In fact, at this point, Quebec
is bracing itself for what may


98
0:5:53,77 --> 0:5:57,27
be the longest summer
in its history.
