0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:4,19
MALE SPEAKER: Thanks for
being here this afternoon.


2
0:0:4,19 --> 0:0:6,33
And today we're
pleased to welcome


3
0:0:6,33 --> 0:0:11,82
Dr. T, a very special
guest from Minneapolis.


4
0:0:11,82 --> 0:0:15,64
Dr. T was born in
Jerusalem, Israel.


5
0:0:15,64 --> 0:0:18,11
He has two doctorate degrees.


6
0:0:18,11 --> 0:0:24,7
One, in Chiropractic, and the
other one, in General Medicine.


7
0:0:24,7 --> 0:0:30,66
Dr. T's specialties is in
health, medicine, nutrition,


8
0:0:30,66 --> 0:0:33,61
and sustainability.


9
0:0:33,61 --> 0:0:37,67
Dr. T had been traveling
extensively, offering


10
0:0:37,67 --> 0:0:42,66
medical care and studying
nutrition practices


11
0:0:42,66 --> 0:0:44,68
around the world.


12
0:0:44,68 --> 0:0:48,2
In the West, we are dealing
with all kinds of stress,


13
0:0:48,2 --> 0:0:51,31
mostly related to work.


14
0:0:51,31 --> 0:0:56,41
Even Google, being the best
company to work for in 2014


15
0:0:56,41 --> 0:1:0,34
according to the "Fortune"
magazine-- we still


16
0:1:0,34 --> 0:1:3,3
feel the stress,
with a smiley face.


17
0:1:3,3 --> 0:1:7,69



18
0:1:7,69 --> 0:1:10,36
On the other hand,
the people in Nepal,


19
0:1:10,36 --> 0:1:12,95
they have a different
type of stress in life,


20
0:1:12,95 --> 0:1:17,9
and that's what I call
everyday life stress.


21
0:1:17,9 --> 0:1:22,5
And, for example, they have
one of the slowest internet


22
0:1:22,5 --> 0:1:26,41
services in the world,
and the internet


23
0:1:26,41 --> 0:1:30,7
was introduced to Nepal in 1994.


24
0:1:30,7 --> 0:1:36,96
And even as of today,
yet their internet speed


25
0:1:36,96 --> 0:1:42,97
is the second slowest in the
world, just behind Libya.


26
0:1:42,97 --> 0:1:43,68
And then, the second
problem they have


27
0:1:43,68 --> 0:1:48,76
is, on average,
most people only get


28
0:1:48,76 --> 0:1:53,25
about 9 to 12 hours of
electricity per day.


29
0:1:53,25 --> 0:1:56,99
So, you can imagine living in
that type of an environment,


30
0:1:56,99 --> 0:2:1,28
and even before these
challenges in life.


31
0:2:1,28 --> 0:2:3,36
But the people in
Nepal are still


32
0:2:3,36 --> 0:2:7,51
pretty happy and
extremely friendly.


33
0:2:7,51 --> 0:2:14,99
And you can find, in
their greeting tradition,


34
0:2:14,99 --> 0:2:19,23
for example, they do
not shake hands or hug.


35
0:2:19,23 --> 0:2:22,12
What they would do is
they close their palm,


36
0:2:22,12 --> 0:2:26,84
and then bow their
head, and say Namaste.


37
0:2:26,84 --> 0:2:32,19
So today, we're lucky to have
Dr. T to share his childhood


38
0:2:32,19 --> 0:2:35,72
experience in
Nepal and then what


39
0:2:35,72 --> 0:2:40,38
we can learn from these people
about the health and also


40
0:2:40,38 --> 0:2:42,34
the stress issue.


41
0:2:42,34 --> 0:2:46,89
And then with that, I would
like to welcome Dr. T to Google.


42
0:2:46,89 --> 0:2:51,822



43
0:2:51,822 --> 0:2:52,822
DR. TEL-OREN: Thank you.


44
0:2:52,822 --> 0:2:54,712
I know that you're
here for many reasons.


45
0:2:54,712 --> 0:2:57,17
Some of you are here because
you want to know about stress,


46
0:2:57,17 --> 0:2:58,586
and some are here
because you want


47
0:2:58,586 --> 0:3:0,33
to know about the
Himalayas, and some


48
0:3:0,33 --> 0:3:3,53
want to know about
the skin, and some


49
0:3:3,53 --> 0:3:6,16
want to know about vitality.


50
0:3:6,16 --> 0:3:8,65
So, how do we weave all
those things together


51
0:3:8,65 --> 0:3:11,29
in just a short talk?


52
0:3:11,29 --> 0:3:13,32
Normally, each one of them
could be a two or three hour


53
0:3:13,32 --> 0:3:14,66
discussion.


54
0:3:14,66 --> 0:3:17,16
So, we have to be a
little more concise


55
0:3:17,16 --> 0:3:19,675
and be rapid in
our presentation.


56
0:3:19,675 --> 0:3:23,13
And we need to realize what's
truly important in life.


57
0:3:23,13 --> 0:3:25,95
What is it makes
people really stressed?


58
0:3:25,95 --> 0:3:27,37
Why are we stressed?


59
0:3:27,37 --> 0:3:30,47
Because we take on more
than we can handle.


60
0:3:30,47 --> 0:3:32,39
Because we have a
lot of expectations


61
0:3:32,39 --> 0:3:36,27
that are put upon us or
that we decide to adopt.


62
0:3:36,27 --> 0:3:37,62
Because we want to Excel.


63
0:3:37,62 --> 0:3:39,69
Because we want to
get appreciation.


64
0:3:39,69 --> 0:3:43,17
Because today people would love
us for what we manufacture,


65
0:3:43,17 --> 0:3:44,38
what we produce.


66
0:3:44,38 --> 0:3:46,12
So, we have to get results.


67
0:3:46,12 --> 0:3:48,97
We are very result
oriented in our society


68
0:3:48,97 --> 0:3:51,8
and if we don't
perform according


69
0:3:51,8 --> 0:3:54,4
to expectation, distress.


70
0:3:54,4 --> 0:3:57,11
Even if we have the best food
in the world and the places


71
0:3:57,11 --> 0:4:1,46
to get suntan, it's not enough.


72
0:4:1,46 --> 0:4:3,51
So, we need to start
thinking about what's


73
0:4:3,51 --> 0:4:10,7
really important to engage in
and to adopt above and beyond


74
0:4:10,7 --> 0:4:15,25
the day-to-day routine of taking
more and more responsibilities


75
0:4:15,25 --> 0:4:20,82
upon ourselves, which is the
main cause for stress in people


76
0:4:20,82 --> 0:4:25,97
who are productive, and
young, and relatively healthy.


77
0:4:25,97 --> 0:4:28,48
Of course, when you
have stress, you


78
0:4:28,48 --> 0:4:32,83
have the physiological and
psychological consequence.


79
0:4:32,83 --> 0:4:36,88
Many people have back
problems and insomnia.


80
0:4:36,88 --> 0:4:40,38
Many people have stomach
upset and headaches.


81
0:4:40,38 --> 0:4:43,84
A lot of people have
palpitation anxiety attack.


82
0:4:43,84 --> 0:4:46,28
A lot of young
people that I see are


83
0:4:46,28 --> 0:4:49,39
suffering from mood disorders.


84
0:4:49,39 --> 0:4:53,29
They simply can't handle the
pressure of the daily life.


85
0:4:53,29 --> 0:4:54,99
And that's not their fault.


86
0:4:54,99 --> 0:4:57,7
It's the fault of
our physiology.


87
0:4:57,7 --> 0:4:58,95
We're not made for that.


88
0:4:58,95 --> 0:5:2,83
We are hardwired, in
our brain, to handle


89
0:5:2,83 --> 0:5:9,7
quick and severe or
extensive stress, that


90
0:5:9,7 --> 0:5:11,64
then abates and disappears.


91
0:5:11,64 --> 0:5:14,29
That's what we are
designed to have in nature.


92
0:5:14,29 --> 0:5:17,65
And we all came from
nature, like it or not.


93
0:5:17,65 --> 0:5:21,84
We came from a place where
we had severe risk of death,


94
0:5:21,84 --> 0:5:26,97
instantly, and then 10 minutes
later that risk passes away.


95
0:5:26,97 --> 0:5:31,65
And if we survived
it, we can relax.


96
0:5:31,65 --> 0:5:34,41
Today we don't have
that opportunity.


97
0:5:34,41 --> 0:5:38,57
If the stress lasts too
long and it is too severe,


98
0:5:38,57 --> 0:5:41,31
the results are extreme.


99
0:5:41,31 --> 0:5:44,38
They've done studies
with mice and they


100
0:5:44,38 --> 0:5:48,6
saw that when the mice are under
severe stress for too long,


101
0:5:48,6 --> 0:5:53,37
after just several
hours of extreme threat,


102
0:5:53,37 --> 0:5:58,8
those mice had three
severe anatomical changes.


103
0:5:58,8 --> 0:6:0,8
In volution of the
reticuloendothelial system,


104
0:6:0,8 --> 0:6:3,85
meaning everything shrinks
in the immune system organs.


105
0:6:3,85 --> 0:6:10,4
Like the thymus, shrinks
rapidly and you could see it.


106
0:6:10,4 --> 0:6:13,48
The adrenal glands, which
are associated with stress,


107
0:6:13,48 --> 0:6:18,36
with the output of stress
hormones, starts swelling


108
0:6:18,36 --> 0:6:25,43
and you see it rapidly, visibly,
anatomical growth, hypertrophy,


109
0:6:25,43 --> 0:6:26,94
of the adrenals.


110
0:6:26,94 --> 0:6:33,9
And the last of the visible
signs, is wounds and open sores


111
0:6:33,9 --> 0:6:37,16
and bleeding ulcers in
the digestive system.


112
0:6:37,16 --> 0:6:38,87
Now this is visible.


113
0:6:38,87 --> 0:6:41,16
Imagine what is not visible.


114
0:6:41,16 --> 0:6:43,54
Imagine all the little
things, the changes,


115
0:6:43,54 --> 0:6:47,22
that happen in the body with our
circulation, with our hormones,


116
0:6:47,22 --> 0:6:49,7
with our neurology.


117
0:6:49,7 --> 0:6:52,25
All those things that happen
that are not visible in mice


118
0:6:52,25 --> 0:6:55,33
within just a few
hours of severe stress.


119
0:6:55,33 --> 0:6:58,12
And this is what we are
enduring in our society


120
0:6:58,12 --> 0:7:1,75
because our stress
is interminable.


121
0:7:1,75 --> 0:7:5,47
It continues, unabated.


122
0:7:5,47 --> 0:7:6,98
We don't know when
to shut it down


123
0:7:6,98 --> 0:7:10,52
because our responsibilities
and the tasks


124
0:7:10,52 --> 0:7:14,59
we have to engage in on
a daily basis don't end.


125
0:7:14,59 --> 0:7:17,86
On the contrary, we keep adding
on and on and on because we


126
0:7:17,86 --> 0:7:20,41
want to excel, we want to
get respect and appreciation


127
0:7:20,41 --> 0:7:23,5
from the jobs, from the
peers, from our friends,


128
0:7:23,5 --> 0:7:24,8
from our family.


129
0:7:24,8 --> 0:7:27,62
Everybody expects
something out of us.


130
0:7:27,62 --> 0:7:32,31
We just don't know where to
let go and how to let go.


131
0:7:32,31 --> 0:7:36,1
So, we go to all of those
methods of stress management


132
0:7:36,1 --> 0:7:37,42
because we have those symptoms.


133
0:7:37,42 --> 0:7:39,926
We can't sleep at night,
we need stimulants


134
0:7:39,926 --> 0:7:41,55
to stay up during
the day because we're


135
0:7:41,55 --> 0:7:43,31
so tired when we wake up.


136
0:7:43,31 --> 0:7:48,62
If we wake up from
a night of no sleep


137
0:7:48,62 --> 0:7:53,54
If you need to drink coffee
or take any stimulants to feel


138
0:7:53,54 --> 0:7:56,46
that you can go
through the day, you're


139
0:7:56,46 --> 0:7:59,75
not getting enough sleep
or poor quality of sleep.


140
0:7:59,75 --> 0:8:2,9
And most people today
need stimulants every day,


141
0:8:2,9 --> 0:8:5,37
whether it's caffeine,
coffee, chocolate,


142
0:8:5,37 --> 0:8:7,13
or other such stimulants.


143
0:8:7,13 --> 0:8:8,75
What are they doing?


144
0:8:8,75 --> 0:8:13,73
They're pressing on the gas
pedal when the tank is empty.


145
0:8:13,73 --> 0:8:16,99
They're forcing us into
the stimulation that


146
0:8:16,99 --> 0:8:21,56
resembles a stress
response, which tells us


147
0:8:21,56 --> 0:8:23,56
that we have a
little more energy.


148
0:8:23,56 --> 0:8:26,54
Our blood supply is
slightly richer in glucose,


149
0:8:26,54 --> 0:8:29,2
so we can bring more
energy to the muscles


150
0:8:29,2 --> 0:8:33,2
for the fight-or-flight
that doesn't exist.


151
0:8:33,2 --> 0:8:35,62
And that is the
stimulant that we always


152
0:8:35,62 --> 0:8:39,94
take thinking it's good for us
because it makes us feel high,


153
0:8:39,94 --> 0:8:44,8
but it's only necessary
because without it we plummet,


154
0:8:44,8 --> 0:8:48,82
and we get tired, we
crash throughout each day.


155
0:8:48,82 --> 0:8:51,89
Sounds familiar to some
of you, doesn't it?


156
0:8:51,89 --> 0:8:55,75
That is not where you want
to be because over time all


157
0:8:55,75 --> 0:9:0,1
of these conditions associated
with the physiological and


158
0:9:0,1 --> 0:9:4,3
emotional stress are
going to simply make


159
0:9:4,3 --> 0:9:9,56
you either fat, or tired,
chronically fatigued,


160
0:9:9,56 --> 0:9:14,22
or having chronically suppressed
immune system resulting


161
0:9:14,22 --> 0:9:16,41
in cancer.


162
0:9:16,41 --> 0:9:18,64
People always go through
these three phases


163
0:9:18,64 --> 0:9:20,48
of general adaptation syndrome.


164
0:9:20,48 --> 0:9:22,68
The first phase is
just being under stress


165
0:9:22,68 --> 0:9:24,11
but not knowing it.


166
0:9:24,11 --> 0:9:27,26
The second, is having the
stress and having those symptoms


167
0:9:27,26 --> 0:9:29,77
of fatigue, and
aches, and pains,


168
0:9:29,77 --> 0:9:33,3
and digestive
complaints, et cetera.


169
0:9:33,3 --> 0:9:38,5
The third phase is when there's
complete systematic break down.


170
0:9:38,5 --> 0:9:40,24
The adrenals are overwhelmed.


171
0:9:40,24 --> 0:9:44,31
They cannot create more of these
hormonal outputs of stress.


172
0:9:44,31 --> 0:9:46,86
At that point,
people either develop


173
0:9:46,86 --> 0:9:48,97
chronic fatigue syndrome
or fybromyalgia,


174
0:9:48,97 --> 0:9:50,87
they become bedridden,
they totally


175
0:9:50,87 --> 0:9:53,34
lose their
functionality, or they


176
0:9:53,34 --> 0:9:57,46
have other severe chronic
condition, or they get cancer.


177
0:9:57,46 --> 0:9:58,55
That's the third phase.


178
0:9:58,55 --> 0:10:1,96
Most people today who are
under significant stress,


179
0:10:1,96 --> 0:10:4,86
are already high
on the second phase


180
0:10:4,86 --> 0:10:10,61
of this general adaptation
syndrome, also known as GAS,


181
0:10:10,61 --> 0:10:14,21
and they are very dangerously
close to phase three.


182
0:10:14,21 --> 0:10:18,85
I see today a lot of young
people in their '20s and '30s


183
0:10:18,85 --> 0:10:22,0
who already are coming
into phase three


184
0:10:22,0 --> 0:10:23,46
and wondering
where it came from.


185
0:10:23,46 --> 0:10:27,8
Not realizing how much of
it is related to the stress


186
0:10:27,8 --> 0:10:28,87
that they're suffering from.


187
0:10:28,87 --> 0:10:30,9
And this is the stress
that is typically


188
0:10:30,9 --> 0:10:33,18
in affluent countries.


189
0:10:33,18 --> 0:10:34,68
We are all suffering
from affluenza.


190
0:10:34,68 --> 0:10:37,19



191
0:10:37,19 --> 0:10:39,8
And we really want
to change that.


192
0:10:39,8 --> 0:10:43,69
We want to start moving
towards simplicity.


193
0:10:43,69 --> 0:10:47,24
It's not always easy when we
have everything available right


194
0:10:47,24 --> 0:10:50,13
in front of us to
just pick and choose.


195
0:10:50,13 --> 0:10:53,63
Sometimes too many choices
is a stressful thing.


196
0:10:53,63 --> 0:10:55,61
You want to just
be told, do this.


197
0:10:55,61 --> 0:10:57,83
You don't want to know
too much information.


198
0:10:57,83 --> 0:11:0,37
Just give me what I need.


199
0:11:0,37 --> 0:11:2,326
But you have too many options.


200
0:11:2,326 --> 0:11:4,58
That is a stress
because you want


201
0:11:4,58 --> 0:11:6,46
to live life to the fullest.


202
0:11:6,46 --> 0:11:8,981
You want to
experience everything.


203
0:11:8,981 --> 0:11:12,21
While people in other countries
don't have that opportunity.


204
0:11:12,21 --> 0:11:17,1
People in Nepal are always
having very few options


205
0:11:17,1 --> 0:11:19,31
to eat, to see.


206
0:11:19,31 --> 0:11:20,55
They never travel much.


207
0:11:20,55 --> 0:11:24,2
They never go on an airplane,
they can't afford it.


208
0:11:24,2 --> 0:11:27,759
So, they stay in one village
in the remote rural Nepal


209
0:11:27,759 --> 0:11:29,55
and they never get out
of that environment.


210
0:11:29,55 --> 0:11:32,83
Maybe once or twice a year
they would travel all the way


211
0:11:32,83 --> 0:11:36,54
to Kathmandu, the
capital of Nepal.


212
0:11:36,54 --> 0:11:38,56
And that's about it.


213
0:11:38,56 --> 0:11:41,55
Those people are always
seeing the same trees,


214
0:11:41,55 --> 0:11:44,4
the same houses,
the same mountains.


215
0:11:44,4 --> 0:11:47,69
They wake up and
everything is predictable.


216
0:11:47,69 --> 0:11:50,48
Now you would say-- and you'd
be correct-- is predictability


217
0:11:50,48 --> 0:11:52,32
always a good thing?


218
0:11:52,32 --> 0:11:54,6
Is nature predictable?


219
0:11:54,6 --> 0:11:58,84
And you'd be right to ask
that because the answer is no.


220
0:11:58,84 --> 0:12:0,42
And I've never said
that their life


221
0:12:0,42 --> 0:12:2,87
is perfect out there in Nepal.


222
0:12:2,87 --> 0:12:5,945
They have a lot of
their own challenges.


223
0:12:5,945 --> 0:12:11,3
But their existence appears
to you to be predictable.


224
0:12:11,3 --> 0:12:13,49
In reality, it's not.


225
0:12:13,49 --> 0:12:16,19
They have constant
change in their life.


226
0:12:16,19 --> 0:12:20,62
Every day brings numerous,
unpredictable events.


227
0:12:20,62 --> 0:12:25,7
They never know if the food will
be good, if there will be food.


228
0:12:25,7 --> 0:12:27,55
They never know
who they're going


229
0:12:27,55 --> 0:12:29,42
to meet coming to
visit their village.


230
0:12:29,42 --> 0:12:32,21
They have a lot of changes
in their environment.


231
0:12:32,21 --> 0:12:35,99
Not just with the seasons,
but with survival.


232
0:12:35,99 --> 0:12:38,85
Every time they walk on the
trail, something happens.


233
0:12:38,85 --> 0:12:41,49
They might have to
confront a mule or a cow


234
0:12:41,49 --> 0:12:46,1
or water Buffalo that might
push them off the trail.


235
0:12:46,1 --> 0:12:51,64
Or they may just have a
landslide that will take down


236
0:12:51,64 --> 0:12:54,93
a whole village and they
would have to somehow make do.


237
0:12:54,93 --> 0:12:59,17
They're always on the survival
mode without even knowing it.


238
0:12:59,17 --> 0:13:1,33
But it's a different
type of survival mode.


239
0:13:1,33 --> 0:13:5,25
It's the kind that brings
change continuously,


240
0:13:5,25 --> 0:13:11,94
where change is expected where
the unpredictable is expected.


241
0:13:11,94 --> 0:13:13,96
Therefore, it is
not so stressful


242
0:13:13,96 --> 0:13:15,78
when you see new things.


243
0:13:15,78 --> 0:13:18,37
Let's contrast
that with Americans


244
0:13:18,37 --> 0:13:20,274
who are accustomed
to their routine.


245
0:13:20,274 --> 0:13:21,94
Every day they have
to get in their car,


246
0:13:21,94 --> 0:13:24,8
drive, go from 9:00
to 5:00, drive back,


247
0:13:24,8 --> 0:13:28,28
stop on the way in the coffee
shop, go to get some bagels.


248
0:13:28,28 --> 0:13:31,7
Those people are doing exactly
the same thing every day.


249
0:13:31,7 --> 0:13:33,65
They are creatures of habit.


250
0:13:33,65 --> 0:13:36,7
But as soon as something
happens that is different,


251
0:13:36,7 --> 0:13:39,91
they can't handle the stress.


252
0:13:39,91 --> 0:13:41,46
They go berserk.


253
0:13:41,46 --> 0:13:45,6
So, they need to drink
alcohol or take some pot.


254
0:13:45,6 --> 0:13:48,37
Drink, smoke some pot
to feel more relaxed


255
0:13:48,37 --> 0:13:51,31
because they can't
handle change.


256
0:13:51,31 --> 0:13:53,44
In nature, we have
to handle change


257
0:13:53,44 --> 0:13:58,77
because from every bush might
be an animal jumping out


258
0:13:58,77 --> 0:14:1,22
at us-- under every tree.


259
0:14:1,22 --> 0:14:4,56
Or every time we have to run
away we have to be prepared,


260
0:14:4,56 --> 0:14:8,8
have to be alert, all the time.


261
0:14:8,8 --> 0:14:10,73
When you get used to
that constant change,


262
0:14:10,73 --> 0:14:13,37
you stop being stressed.


263
0:14:13,37 --> 0:14:17,3
So, this is one thing
I like to teach people,


264
0:14:17,3 --> 0:14:20,31
to keep making your life varied.


265
0:14:20,31 --> 0:14:24,8
Increase variety,
complexity, in your life.


266
0:14:24,8 --> 0:14:27,93
Allow things not to be simple,
while you live a simpler


267
0:14:27,93 --> 0:14:29,59
lifestyle.


268
0:14:29,59 --> 0:14:33,86
Sounds like a contradiction,
but it's the truth.


269
0:14:33,86 --> 0:14:40,15
Simplify your life in what
you take on, but increase


270
0:14:40,15 --> 0:14:42,64
the variety so that
you are accustomed


271
0:14:42,64 --> 0:14:44,89
to the unpredictable.


272
0:14:44,89 --> 0:14:47,39
Go outdoors into nature.


273
0:14:47,39 --> 0:14:50,2
Many people will tell
you that to reduce stress


274
0:14:50,2 --> 0:14:53,79
you have to either
meditate, or do mindfulness,


275
0:14:53,79 --> 0:15:1,11
or hypnotherapy, or guided
imagery, or Tai Chi.


276
0:15:1,11 --> 0:15:2,88
There are so many
techniques that


277
0:15:2,88 --> 0:15:8,21
are being told to you that are
great to manage your stress.


278
0:15:8,21 --> 0:15:10,78
They don't treat the
underlying cause of stress,


279
0:15:10,78 --> 0:15:12,63
but they help you manage it.


280
0:15:12,63 --> 0:15:18,77
And they're good, but one thing
on the list is go to nature.


281
0:15:18,77 --> 0:15:21,17
Learn from nature.


282
0:15:21,17 --> 0:15:24,0
Your body,
physiologically, is adapted


283
0:15:24,0 --> 0:15:27,31
through tens of thousands of
years and hundreds of thousands


284
0:15:27,31 --> 0:15:32,43
of years to the natural
environment from which we came.


285
0:15:32,43 --> 0:15:35,36
Eat according to
nature because any time


286
0:15:35,36 --> 0:15:37,79
you have a slight
disorder, anytime you


287
0:15:37,79 --> 0:15:39,75
have a slight
nutritional deficiency,


288
0:15:39,75 --> 0:15:43,185
anytime you're exposed
to toxins, all of those


289
0:15:43,185 --> 0:15:48,15
are related to our departure
from what's natural.


290
0:15:48,15 --> 0:15:51,1
We need to try to correct that.


291
0:15:51,1 --> 0:15:53,51
And in nature we
have extreme variety


292
0:15:53,51 --> 0:15:57,13
of foods that are
made by nature that we


293
0:15:57,13 --> 0:16:1,62
would have had in nature in
their natural pristine state.


294
0:16:1,62 --> 0:16:5,51
Today, how much of a
variety do we have in food?


295
0:16:5,51 --> 0:16:7,98
You could go to all
of Google cafeterias,


296
0:16:7,98 --> 0:16:12,6
you would still not have more
than 50 foods covering just


297
0:16:12,6 --> 0:16:14,62
about the whole gamut.


298
0:16:14,62 --> 0:16:18,1
50 vegetables, and spices,
and grains, and legumes,


299
0:16:18,1 --> 0:16:20,97
and few other things
Not that much.


300
0:16:20,97 --> 0:16:23,87
But if you go
foraging in nature,


301
0:16:23,87 --> 0:16:27,32
as our predecessors did--
our ancestors foraged


302
0:16:27,32 --> 0:16:30,17
all the time before
agricultural age--


303
0:16:30,17 --> 0:16:33,66
you would have unlimited
number of foods


304
0:16:33,66 --> 0:16:36,31
to choose from all the time.


305
0:16:36,31 --> 0:16:38,6
And you would have
the unpredictability


306
0:16:38,6 --> 0:16:41,87
of what would be
available, which keeps you


307
0:16:41,87 --> 0:16:44,31
on your toes in a healthy way.


308
0:16:44,31 --> 0:16:46,59
It keeps you excited about life.


309
0:16:46,59 --> 0:16:50,3
So, please bring variety
into your life and please


310
0:16:50,3 --> 0:16:54,33
go to nature to learn
from her, and not


311
0:16:54,33 --> 0:16:58,12
just to use her as a
shelter from stress.


312
0:16:58,12 --> 0:17:1,17
And if you do go
into nature, then you


313
0:17:1,17 --> 0:17:3,6
start learning other
things because you


314
0:17:3,6 --> 0:17:9,27
will see the different animals
and people that co-inhabit


315
0:17:9,27 --> 0:17:12,69
that natural environment,
and you see what they do


316
0:17:12,69 --> 0:17:13,829
and what they don't do.


317
0:17:13,829 --> 0:17:15,9
That is true for learning
from other people.


318
0:17:15,9 --> 0:17:16,88
What do they do?


319
0:17:16,88 --> 0:17:18,55
What do they not do?


320
0:17:18,55 --> 0:17:21,31
And what makes them
healthier than us,


321
0:17:21,31 --> 0:17:23,829
is always an important question.


322
0:17:23,829 --> 0:17:28,375
You know that 79 million
Americans have pre-diabetes.


323
0:17:28,375 --> 0:17:30,99



324
0:17:30,99 --> 0:17:32,75
That's a huge number.


325
0:17:32,75 --> 0:17:35,84
You know that hundreds
of thousands of children


326
0:17:35,84 --> 0:17:41,91
are being diagnosed,
before age 10, with cancer.


327
0:17:41,91 --> 0:17:45,62
Pediatric cancer is
a fast growing trend


328
0:17:45,62 --> 0:17:50,5
and most hospitals are
building special wings


329
0:17:50,5 --> 0:17:53,33
for childhood cancer.


330
0:17:53,33 --> 0:17:57,37
And we have one out of three
or four children on drugs


331
0:17:57,37 --> 0:18:0,57
or diagnosed with a disease.


332
0:18:0,57 --> 0:18:2,71
And almost all
the children today


333
0:18:2,71 --> 0:18:6,4
have some allergies, or
asthma, autoimmune disease,


334
0:18:6,4 --> 0:18:10,94
or immune suppression condition
that will never [INAUDIBLE]


335
0:18:10,94 --> 0:18:11,44
of children.


336
0:18:11,44 --> 0:18:15,17



337
0:18:15,17 --> 0:18:17,68
So, many children are
diagnosed with learning


338
0:18:17,68 --> 0:18:22,32
disorders, and autism,
and other conditions that


339
0:18:22,32 --> 0:18:24,9
didn't used to be so popular.


340
0:18:24,9 --> 0:18:27,0
Once, it was 1 in
10,000 children--


341
0:18:27,0 --> 0:18:30,2
not too long ago, a
few decades-- and now


342
0:18:30,2 --> 0:18:34,99
1 out of 49 children are
diagnosed as having autism.


343
0:18:34,99 --> 0:18:37,346
What's happening to
the next generation?


344
0:18:37,346 --> 0:18:38,97
Many of you are going
to have children,


345
0:18:38,97 --> 0:18:40,96
if you don't have them already.


346
0:18:40,96 --> 0:18:44,4
What's happening to our children
that makes them suddenly


347
0:18:44,4 --> 0:18:46,74
the sickest children
have ever been?


348
0:18:46,74 --> 0:18:49,65
Shouldn't we learn
something about what


349
0:18:49,65 --> 0:18:54,57
is happening in other countries
to compare and contrast and see


350
0:18:54,57 --> 0:18:57,69
what we can learn to save a
whole generation of children


351
0:18:57,69 --> 0:18:59,47
in this country?


352
0:18:59,47 --> 0:19:1,21
How do we do that?


353
0:19:1,21 --> 0:19:3,8
How do we learn about the
health of our children


354
0:19:3,8 --> 0:19:8,22
when they're all exposed
to the same factors,


355
0:19:8,22 --> 0:19:9,99
such as we don't
have a control group.


356
0:19:9,99 --> 0:19:12,25
If we want to do a
scientific study.


357
0:19:12,25 --> 0:19:14,58
We can't.


358
0:19:14,58 --> 0:19:18,71
We have to go somewhere else
where the children have not


359
0:19:18,71 --> 0:19:22,559
been exposed to what children
here have been exposed to.


360
0:19:22,559 --> 0:19:24,1
There have been
studies with children


361
0:19:24,1 --> 0:19:27,6
who have moved from
one country to another,


362
0:19:27,6 --> 0:19:29,81
and they saw
clearly, the children


363
0:19:29,81 --> 0:19:34,28
who moved to an
affluent Western nation


364
0:19:34,28 --> 0:19:38,33
to a more primitive,
more developing nation,


365
0:19:38,33 --> 0:19:43,15
the earlier they move to
the newer place, the newer


366
0:19:43,15 --> 0:19:47,9
residence, the more they
adopted the same diseases


367
0:19:47,9 --> 0:19:50,52
and disorders, including
mental diseases,


368
0:19:50,52 --> 0:19:55,8
of the new adoptive country
that they've joined.


369
0:19:55,8 --> 0:19:58,61
That is a very
important observation.


370
0:19:58,61 --> 0:20:3,18
So, if a child comes to the
United States from Ethiopia


371
0:20:3,18 --> 0:20:6,84
when he or she is
only 6 years old,


372
0:20:6,84 --> 0:20:11,38
they're going to be a lot
healthier than the local kids


373
0:20:11,38 --> 0:20:16,72
because they had 6 years
in a primitive environment.


374
0:20:16,72 --> 0:20:21,27
But if they come here at age
2 or age 1, or worse yet,


375
0:20:21,27 --> 0:20:26,72
at age 6 months, they develop
all the medical, and mental,


376
0:20:26,72 --> 0:20:29,82
and behavioral conditions
that are typically


377
0:20:29,82 --> 0:20:32,91
in the modern country
that they've joined.


378
0:20:32,91 --> 0:20:35,31
Shouldn't we try to ask
ourselves the question,


379
0:20:35,31 --> 0:20:36,67
why is that the case.


380
0:20:36,67 --> 0:20:40,53
What are we doing to children
that makes them so sick?


381
0:20:40,53 --> 0:20:44,31
How do we study that
when in our country


382
0:20:44,31 --> 0:20:47,761
all the children are
exposed to the same things?


383
0:20:47,761 --> 0:20:49,76
So, if we asked ourselves,
is it because they're


384
0:20:49,76 --> 0:20:52,49
exposed to too many
electromagnetic radiation


385
0:20:52,49 --> 0:20:53,93
sources?


386
0:20:53,93 --> 0:20:57,23
Is because they had
too many vaccines?


387
0:20:57,23 --> 0:21:0,37
Is it because they eat
genetically modified organisms?


388
0:21:0,37 --> 0:21:2,27
Is it because of something else?


389
0:21:2,27 --> 0:21:4,83
Too much stress, perhaps?


390
0:21:4,83 --> 0:21:7,22
They know when they are 2
years old that one day they


391
0:21:7,22 --> 0:21:8,725
will work in Google.


392
0:21:8,725 --> 0:21:12,3
They already are stressed out.


393
0:21:12,3 --> 0:21:14,0
Who knows.


394
0:21:14,0 --> 0:21:15,57
We don't have the answers.


395
0:21:15,57 --> 0:21:20,3
But the only way to find out is
to start asking the questions


396
0:21:20,3 --> 0:21:21,82
and doing some studies.


397
0:21:21,82 --> 0:21:25,6
For that we need
a control group.


398
0:21:25,6 --> 0:21:29,15
It just so happens that you
can create a control group


399
0:21:29,15 --> 0:21:32,51
in a place that is far away
from the United States.


400
0:21:32,51 --> 0:21:36,78
A place that is so
pristine, and so primitive,


401
0:21:36,78 --> 0:21:41,98
so underdeveloped, that
most of the young children


402
0:21:41,98 --> 0:21:44,58
have not been exposed to
what our children have


403
0:21:44,58 --> 0:21:46,15
been exposed to.


404
0:21:46,15 --> 0:21:49,26
If we can have a good
number of children


405
0:21:49,26 --> 0:21:55,17
that we could study how
healthy they really are,


406
0:21:55,17 --> 0:21:58,46
how lacking they are in mental
and behavioral disorders when


407
0:21:58,46 --> 0:22:2,41
they go to school, how easy it
is to teach them, how excited


408
0:22:2,41 --> 0:22:3,5
they are to go to school.


409
0:22:3,5 --> 0:22:5,9
And they are
beautifully behaved.


410
0:22:5,9 --> 0:22:11,0
They always are excited to
study, to learn new things.


411
0:22:11,0 --> 0:22:15,19
When you see those children
and you fall in love with them,


412
0:22:15,19 --> 0:22:16,94
you think, what a
great thing we can


413
0:22:16,94 --> 0:22:21,69
do to impart some of their
health to other people


414
0:22:21,69 --> 0:22:24,4
in developing countries
who are suffering


415
0:22:24,4 --> 0:22:26,53
from all those modern diseases
of children that have never


416
0:22:26,53 --> 0:22:32,31
been a part of our life until
just the last few decades.


417
0:22:32,31 --> 0:22:34,29
Instead of just
worrying about it


418
0:22:34,29 --> 0:22:36,32
and getting more
and more hospitals


419
0:22:36,32 --> 0:22:38,64
to build more and
more cancer wings,


420
0:22:38,64 --> 0:22:42,0
shouldn't we find the
causes and treat them


421
0:22:42,0 --> 0:22:44,51
or avoid them or prevent them.


422
0:22:44,51 --> 0:22:48,73
Preventive medicine
is not so heroic.


423
0:22:48,73 --> 0:22:52,14
It's exactly the
same as preventing


424
0:22:52,14 --> 0:22:56,87
suffering in children in
Nepal because while we create


425
0:22:56,87 --> 0:22:59,66
the control group of
thousands and thousands


426
0:22:59,66 --> 0:23:3,26
of children that can show
us the way, can guide us


427
0:23:3,26 --> 0:23:8,56
into the light of health and
vitality, at the same time,


428
0:23:8,56 --> 0:23:12,9
we can help them avoid the
horrific tragedy of childhood


429
0:23:12,9 --> 0:23:15,14
trafficking.


430
0:23:15,14 --> 0:23:21,23
15,000 children,
in Nepal alone, are


431
0:23:21,23 --> 0:23:23,5
used in trafficking,
prostitution,


432
0:23:23,5 --> 0:23:27,93
slavery every year, even now.


433
0:23:27,93 --> 0:23:29,98
15,000 for a small country.


434
0:23:29,98 --> 0:23:31,39
That's a huge tragedy.


435
0:23:31,39 --> 0:23:34,29



436
0:23:34,29 --> 0:23:38,63
Some of them are ending up as
domestic workers and slaves.


437
0:23:38,63 --> 0:23:41,62
But most of them
end up in India,


438
0:23:41,62 --> 0:23:46,68
where they're sold for
prostitution or slavery


439
0:23:46,68 --> 0:23:51,63
and it's because their
environment is so poor, so


440
0:23:51,63 --> 0:23:55,84
destitute, that they have
no capability of organizing.


441
0:23:55,84 --> 0:23:58,3
Their communities
are fragmented.


442
0:23:58,3 --> 0:24:0,83
Their families have
fallen apart, not just


443
0:24:0,83 --> 0:24:3,45
because of a 10
year civil war that


444
0:24:3,45 --> 0:24:7,93
left the country in
a desperate state,


445
0:24:7,93 --> 0:24:11,3
but also because there
are no opportunities


446
0:24:11,3 --> 0:24:13,34
in the rural areas of Nepal.


447
0:24:13,34 --> 0:24:16,29
No socioeconomic
opportunity, no health


448
0:24:16,29 --> 0:24:19,66
care available, no
educational opportunities,


449
0:24:19,66 --> 0:24:23,43
so the children end up in
the fields all the time


450
0:24:23,43 --> 0:24:26,47
and they are simple
and easy to pick.


451
0:24:26,47 --> 0:24:29,1
And their parents are
totally illiterate,


452
0:24:29,1 --> 0:24:31,6
so it's easy to come to
a parent and say we're


453
0:24:31,6 --> 0:24:33,18
going to take your
child and give her


454
0:24:33,18 --> 0:24:37,33
a great education in India and
put her in some boarding school


455
0:24:37,33 --> 0:24:39,75
where she will learn
English and learn a vocation


456
0:24:39,75 --> 0:24:41,63
and have a great
successful life.


457
0:24:41,63 --> 0:24:44,88
If you are a parent that can't
offer anything to your child,


458
0:24:44,88 --> 0:24:46,37
you'd fall for that.


459
0:24:46,37 --> 0:24:50,49
And that child ends up
trafficked and suffering


460
0:24:50,49 --> 0:24:54,15
horribly for the
rest of her life.


461
0:24:54,15 --> 0:24:59,21
That can be easily prevented
with very little money


462
0:24:59,21 --> 0:25:2,71
because prevention is
1,000 to 10,000 times more


463
0:25:2,71 --> 0:25:6,86
effective than heroic
salvation after the fact.


464
0:25:6,86 --> 0:25:10,89
So, instead of the expensive
emergency room medicine,


465
0:25:10,89 --> 0:25:16,5
we're engaging in lifestyle,
nutritional, stress reduction


466
0:25:16,5 --> 0:25:19,54
type of medicine, which
prevents the disease


467
0:25:19,54 --> 0:25:22,46
at a tiny, tiny
fraction of the cost.


468
0:25:22,46 --> 0:25:28,15
As I said, it's not heroic,
it's not so attractive and sexy,


469
0:25:28,15 --> 0:25:30,52
because you can't
pinpoint those children


470
0:25:30,52 --> 0:25:31,51
that you've saved
from trafficking.


471
0:25:31,51 --> 0:25:34,19



472
0:25:34,19 --> 0:25:36,97
But you make a real
impact, especially


473
0:25:36,97 --> 0:25:40,13
if you go through
those societies,


474
0:25:40,13 --> 0:25:43,21
in those remote areas,
and you help them organize


475
0:25:43,21 --> 0:25:45,29
and then you make
them participate,


476
0:25:45,29 --> 0:25:47,39
so it is more sustainable.


477
0:25:47,39 --> 0:25:49,82
And you help rebuild
their communities


478
0:25:49,82 --> 0:25:51,91
and build for them a
community center that


479
0:25:51,91 --> 0:25:54,98
could take care of their
health and hygiene.


480
0:25:54,98 --> 0:25:57,7
And start doing adult
literacy program


481
0:25:57,7 --> 0:25:58,81
that teach the
parents some skills


482
0:25:58,81 --> 0:26:0,31
and how to read and write.


483
0:26:0,31 --> 0:26:2,51
And organize the women
in mother's groups


484
0:26:2,51 --> 0:26:7,1
because the mother is really the
beginning and end of the family


485
0:26:7,1 --> 0:26:10,44
caretaker, the educator.


486
0:26:10,44 --> 0:26:13,56
Take care of those
in a sustainable way


487
0:26:13,56 --> 0:26:15,92
and you don't need much money.


488
0:26:15,92 --> 0:26:22,3
For only 8 and 1/2
dollars a month per child,


489
0:26:22,3 --> 0:26:26,62
I can, by myself,
sustain 5,000 children


490
0:26:26,62 --> 0:26:29,77
with Everest Learning
Academy-- which I really


491
0:26:29,77 --> 0:26:32,7
want to applaud Google
because Google now


492
0:26:32,7 --> 0:26:36,41
has its own matching program,
so people could contribute money


493
0:26:36,41 --> 0:26:39,68
to the Ecopolitan
Eco-Health Community, which


494
0:26:39,68 --> 0:26:41,9
supports the Everest Academy.


495
0:26:41,9 --> 0:26:44,32
And I have some great news--
you're the first group


496
0:26:44,32 --> 0:26:48,16
to hear about it-- that
we are now, finally,


497
0:26:48,16 --> 0:26:51,7
recognized by the Nepali
Social Welfare Council


498
0:26:51,7 --> 0:26:57,99
as an international NGO,
similar to the Peace Corps.


499
0:26:57,99 --> 0:27:0,99
And we are just a few
people, not a government.


500
0:27:0,99 --> 0:27:4,96



501
0:27:4,96 --> 0:27:8,4
So, I invite you
to start thinking


502
0:27:8,4 --> 0:27:10,77
about things bigger
than yourself.


503
0:27:10,77 --> 0:27:15,8
That might be the thinking
person's stress relief.


504
0:27:15,8 --> 0:27:19,11
Start thinking about what you
can do to make life better


505
0:27:19,11 --> 0:27:22,68
on earth, not just for
yourself, but for others.


506
0:27:22,68 --> 0:27:24,48
When you do that,
suddenly the stress


507
0:27:24,48 --> 0:27:27,59
will melt way because
now you have a vision


508
0:27:27,59 --> 0:27:29,88
and you have a purpose.


509
0:27:29,88 --> 0:27:31,53
Think about it.


510
0:27:31,53 --> 0:27:34,4
They've done studies with
people who are stressed,


511
0:27:34,4 --> 0:27:37,72
and they said, yes,
stress will kill you.


512
0:27:37,72 --> 0:27:41,33
But for some reason, some people
have the highest stress level


513
0:27:41,33 --> 0:27:43,59
and they live the longest.


514
0:27:43,59 --> 0:27:44,91
Studies have shown that.


515
0:27:44,91 --> 0:27:46,32
It's a Paradox.


516
0:27:46,32 --> 0:27:49,84
So, you have to start
looking, who are those people


517
0:27:49,84 --> 0:27:52,76
because we want to
be like them, right?


518
0:27:52,76 --> 0:27:55,97
And we find out that those
who live the longest,


519
0:27:55,97 --> 0:27:59,51
despite severe stress,
are the ones who


520
0:27:59,51 --> 0:28:2,9
are in charge of
their own destiny.


521
0:28:2,9 --> 0:28:6,94
The ones who are not pushed
to a nine to five job,


522
0:28:6,94 --> 0:28:10,42
but feel like they
create their own reality.


523
0:28:10,42 --> 0:28:15,14
They manifest their own
dreams, visions, and missions.


524
0:28:15,14 --> 0:28:17,18
Does it mean that the only
people who are the bosses


525
0:28:17,18 --> 0:28:19,17
can live long?


526
0:28:19,17 --> 0:28:20,96
Not necessarily.


527
0:28:20,96 --> 0:28:23,81
Even people who
work a 9 to 5 job


528
0:28:23,81 --> 0:28:26,36
can create a purpose
for themselves.


529
0:28:26,36 --> 0:28:28,63
Can become the heroes
of their community


530
0:28:28,63 --> 0:28:31,83
and of remote countries.


531
0:28:31,83 --> 0:28:37,86
Can venture into new lands
where they can do some good.


532
0:28:37,86 --> 0:28:41,14
And while doing that,
they think every day,


533
0:28:41,14 --> 0:28:44,39
what am I doing today
that meets or gets me


534
0:28:44,39 --> 0:28:47,16
a step closer to that purpose?


535
0:28:47,16 --> 0:28:49,29
How do I make earth
a better place


536
0:28:49,29 --> 0:28:52,15
from me, and for my children,
and for my friends' children


537
0:28:52,15 --> 0:28:54,63
and great grandchildren?


538
0:28:54,63 --> 0:28:56,66
How do we make this
a better place?


539
0:28:56,66 --> 0:29:0,89
If you take a purpose to your
heart and start implementing,


540
0:29:0,89 --> 0:29:4,93
on a daily basis,
whatever it is,


541
0:29:4,93 --> 0:29:8,68
it will simply
overshadow the stress


542
0:29:8,68 --> 0:29:13,15
of trying to simply preserve
your own ego in a society that


543
0:29:13,15 --> 0:29:14,74
expects so much of you.


544
0:29:14,74 --> 0:29:17,29
Where your responsibility
that you adopt


545
0:29:17,29 --> 0:29:20,7
are so numerous just
because you need


546
0:29:20,7 --> 0:29:24,45
to have affirmation
and acceptance


547
0:29:24,45 --> 0:29:27,54
from your peers and
your family members.


548
0:29:27,54 --> 0:29:30,7
Do something that's outside
of yourself and people


549
0:29:30,7 --> 0:29:33,7
will leave you alone and they
will not expect much of you


550
0:29:33,7 --> 0:29:36,6
because you'll be
doing something good.


551
0:29:36,6 --> 0:29:39,61
Not just for yourself, not
just for your own pocket.


552
0:29:39,61 --> 0:29:44,31
People who just work for
money have a lot of stress


553
0:29:44,31 --> 0:29:47,3
because they always worry,
will they have enough money


554
0:29:47,3 --> 0:29:51,24
to meet their next
consumerism goal.


555
0:29:51,24 --> 0:29:54,81
What are they going to buy
next that they won't to use.


556
0:29:54,81 --> 0:29:57,42
That will rot in their
garage-- three car


557
0:29:57,42 --> 0:30:3,37
garage, which has
four cars in it.


558
0:30:3,37 --> 0:30:5,7
What are those
people going to do?


559
0:30:5,7 --> 0:30:6,92
Nothing.


560
0:30:6,92 --> 0:30:9,31
They just have to keep
showing off to other people


561
0:30:9,31 --> 0:30:11,97
how much they have.


562
0:30:11,97 --> 0:30:14,42
So, instead you have
various options.


563
0:30:14,42 --> 0:30:16,54
You can contribute to
worthwhile causes--


564
0:30:16,54 --> 0:30:18,146
we're going to match you.


565
0:30:18,146 --> 0:30:22,61
You work here-- or you
could decide to join.


566
0:30:22,61 --> 0:30:26,24
You can start getting
into the activism mode.


567
0:30:26,24 --> 0:30:28,68
We already have 5,000
children in our network


568
0:30:28,68 --> 0:30:32,29
of 65 projects of schools,
and childcare centers,


569
0:30:32,29 --> 0:30:35,82
and orphanages, and
community care centers


570
0:30:35,82 --> 0:30:38,45
and we're growing rapidly.


571
0:30:38,45 --> 0:30:42,68
We need somebody to be
creative and think and help


572
0:30:42,68 --> 0:30:46,37
us create a technological system
that will allow us to collect


573
0:30:46,37 --> 0:30:50,4
all the data we need to
collect about the health of all


574
0:30:50,4 --> 0:30:51,89
the children in our network.


575
0:30:51,89 --> 0:30:55,8
My goal is to get
to 100,000 children.


576
0:30:55,8 --> 0:31:1,49
If you participate, as creative
individuals, and help us


577
0:31:1,49 --> 0:31:4,11
find a system, a
method, that allows


578
0:31:4,11 --> 0:31:8,15
us to collect all the
information that we need


579
0:31:8,15 --> 0:31:15,12
to truly tabulate the mental,
emotional, social, and physical


580
0:31:15,12 --> 0:31:20,9
health of our thousands
and thousands of children.


581
0:31:20,9 --> 0:31:24,27
That would help us take better
care of our children in Nepal,


582
0:31:24,27 --> 0:31:27,6
but it will also help
us create the data


583
0:31:27,6 --> 0:31:31,29
that will allow us to start
implementing some changes that


584
0:31:31,29 --> 0:31:35,3
are necessary so that the
hospitals will stop building


585
0:31:35,3 --> 0:31:38,62
those cancer wings for children,
so that the pediatrician will


586
0:31:38,62 --> 0:31:42,3
not have to treat so
many children with drugs,


587
0:31:42,3 --> 0:31:45,24
so the children will not
be diagnosed with autism


588
0:31:45,24 --> 0:31:51,4
and have to take various
drugs for ADD and ADHD.


589
0:31:51,4 --> 0:31:52,9
That's not necessary.


590
0:31:52,9 --> 0:31:54,76
We just need to
understand why is it


591
0:31:54,76 --> 0:31:58,61
that 100,000
children-- God willing,


592
0:31:58,61 --> 0:32:3,23
if we get 200,000 children
with the support of populations


593
0:32:3,23 --> 0:32:8,11
that care, that have
the ability to care,


594
0:32:8,11 --> 0:32:9,86
then we can really
help the whole world


595
0:32:9,86 --> 0:32:12,8
because the modern
civilization is


596
0:32:12,8 --> 0:32:16,22
where we have more problems
than we have over there.


597
0:32:16,22 --> 0:32:17,87
As soon as they're
organized, as soon


598
0:32:17,87 --> 0:32:19,71
they can take care
of themselves,


599
0:32:19,71 --> 0:32:23,57
as soon as they have schools and
child care centers so that they


600
0:32:23,57 --> 0:32:26,56
can get to work, as soon as
they learn to read and write.


601
0:32:26,56 --> 0:32:29,7
We give them the
opportunity to acquire


602
0:32:29,7 --> 0:32:32,33
a skill that will make
their life in rural Nepal


603
0:32:32,33 --> 0:32:34,6
a lot better, a lot easier.


604
0:32:34,6 --> 0:32:38,17
We can preserve their
culture, their ethnicity.


605
0:32:38,17 --> 0:32:40,23
And you're welcome to visit.


606
0:32:40,23 --> 0:32:42,2
You can come and check with us.


607
0:32:42,2 --> 0:32:44,29
In March, we have some
people from Google


608
0:32:44,29 --> 0:32:47,12
coming to represent Google.


609
0:32:47,12 --> 0:32:51,8
And we will have other
people coming in October.


610
0:32:51,8 --> 0:32:52,76
We do it twice a year.


611
0:32:52,76 --> 0:32:55,112
You can come and join our
treks and see for yourself


612
0:32:55,112 --> 0:32:56,32
what we do with the children.


613
0:32:56,32 --> 0:33:1,0
You can volunteer or you could
just do it from your own home.


614
0:33:1,0 --> 0:33:2,92
Help us create a system.


615
0:33:2,92 --> 0:33:6,6
Let's design something
that allows technology


616
0:33:6,6 --> 0:33:8,71
to collect the
information we need


617
0:33:8,71 --> 0:33:11,235
to make this earth
a better place.


618
0:33:11,235 --> 0:33:16,17
And In the meantime, we just
need to support it financially.


619
0:33:16,17 --> 0:33:20,77
Financially we do the support
through the skin clinics,


620
0:33:20,77 --> 0:33:24,27
which is something that I
created many, many years ago.


621
0:33:24,27 --> 0:33:28,97
A way to eliminate and
prevent skin cancer, which


622
0:33:28,97 --> 0:33:31,64
is the most common
cancer there is.


623
0:33:31,64 --> 0:33:33,67
It is so easy to
prevent melanomas,


624
0:33:33,67 --> 0:33:36,98
which kills tens of thousands
of Americans every year.


625
0:33:36,98 --> 0:33:41,46
So easy, you just have to
eliminate the lesions that


626
0:33:41,46 --> 0:33:45,94
might become cancer five years
from now or 10 years from now.


627
0:33:45,94 --> 0:33:47,79
It's true prevention.


628
0:33:47,79 --> 0:33:53,65
If you have 100 lesions on your
body-- little dark spots, flat,


629
0:33:53,65 --> 0:33:57,52
where the sun won't
shine-- be aware.


630
0:33:57,52 --> 0:34:1,34
Melanoma, the lethal skin
cancer everybody is afraid of,


631
0:34:1,34 --> 0:34:4,87
always always
develops in the places


632
0:34:4,87 --> 0:34:8,59
that have not been
exposed to the sun.


633
0:34:8,59 --> 0:34:10,59
Surprising.


634
0:34:10,59 --> 0:34:13,205
But it's not surprising,
we've known it for many years.


635
0:34:13,205 --> 0:34:16,44
The information you're
getting from the establishment


636
0:34:16,44 --> 0:34:18,13
is not accurate.


637
0:34:18,13 --> 0:34:20,21
You have to open the
textbook yourself


638
0:34:20,21 --> 0:34:23,59
and find out where
those melanomas occur.


639
0:34:23,59 --> 0:34:25,37
And you'll be
surprised that they


640
0:34:25,37 --> 0:34:27,38
occur on the scalp
under the hair,


641
0:34:27,38 --> 0:34:29,51
behind your neck where
there's no sun exposure,


642
0:34:29,51 --> 0:34:33,57
on your torso, and your
armpits, under your bikini line,


643
0:34:33,57 --> 0:34:37,659
in the white spots that
have never seen the sun.


644
0:34:37,659 --> 0:34:40,679
You better start
mooning the sun,


645
0:34:40,679 --> 0:34:45,4
so the sun will shine where
it normally doesn't shine.


646
0:34:45,4 --> 0:34:47,679
Get some sun exposure
in the various places,


647
0:34:47,679 --> 0:34:50,42
but you have to do it regularly.


648
0:34:50,42 --> 0:34:53,32
Because if you don't,
those white areas


649
0:34:53,32 --> 0:34:57,84
that are irregularly exposed
once every six months,


650
0:34:57,84 --> 0:35:0,17
that's where you will
develop your melanomas


651
0:35:0,17 --> 0:35:4,16
and they start from little dark
spots that can gradually grow.


652
0:35:4,16 --> 0:35:5,67
Catch all of those dark spots.


653
0:35:5,67 --> 0:35:7,97
Eliminate them now.


654
0:35:7,97 --> 0:35:9,255
It's so easy.


655
0:35:9,255 --> 0:35:11,2
No surgery necessary.


656
0:35:11,2 --> 0:35:13,49
No medical treatment necessary.


657
0:35:13,49 --> 0:35:17,63
You can get rid of a hundred
of them in just one sitting.


658
0:35:17,63 --> 0:35:20,37
And by doing that--
with any of the doctors


659
0:35:20,37 --> 0:35:24,9
that I have trained, in
various places in the world,


660
0:35:24,9 --> 0:35:29,52
to do this using my method--
by removing those skin lesions,


661
0:35:29,52 --> 0:35:32,52
you prevent yourself from
developing skin cancer.


662
0:35:32,52 --> 0:35:34,92
Also, the carcinomas
are very easy to treat--


663
0:35:34,92 --> 0:35:36,72
that's a different
type of skin cancer.


664
0:35:36,72 --> 0:35:40,21
Very easy to work with
those type of skin lesion


665
0:35:40,21 --> 0:35:43,16
and catch them early.


666
0:35:43,16 --> 0:35:46,44
Very good to remove
protrusions and growths,


667
0:35:46,44 --> 0:35:50,61
which could develop as a
result of hormonal imbalance


668
0:35:50,61 --> 0:35:54,62
or the result of
unhealthy nutrition.


669
0:35:54,62 --> 0:35:57,41
And remember, if you get sick
because of unhealthy nutrition


670
0:35:57,41 --> 0:36:1,22
or lack of sleep or
other types of exposures


671
0:36:1,22 --> 0:36:4,45
or toxic exposures, the stress
that you have in your life


672
0:36:4,45 --> 0:36:6,13
becomes far worse.


673
0:36:6,13 --> 0:36:9,75
It's makes every
disease magnified.


674
0:36:9,75 --> 0:36:14,31
So, you do want to eat really
well according to nature.


675
0:36:14,31 --> 0:36:17,85
If you want to know
what I mean by nature,


676
0:36:17,85 --> 0:36:22,515
go to the website
thetruthaboutyourfood.com


677
0:36:22,515 --> 0:36:25,85
where I give 12 hours
of free information.


678
0:36:25,85 --> 0:36:27,58
12 hours of lectures
that you get


679
0:36:27,58 --> 0:36:30,31
for free--
thetruthaboutyourfood.com.


680
0:36:30,31 --> 0:36:34,1
Then, you'll learn about healthy
nutrition according to nature


681
0:36:34,1 --> 0:36:37,28
and according to science.


682
0:36:37,28 --> 0:36:40,29
You do that, you
reduce your skin aging.


683
0:36:40,29 --> 0:36:42,9



684
0:36:42,9 --> 0:36:46,73
You make sure that you have
all the nutrients necessary,


685
0:36:46,73 --> 0:36:50,64
like sulfur, which is a crucial
nutrient for the skin health


686
0:36:50,64 --> 0:36:52,25
and for your hair health.


687
0:36:52,25 --> 0:36:54,66
When you have not sufficient
sulfur in your body,


688
0:36:54,66 --> 0:36:59,4
your hair starts falling and
becomes fragile and brittle.


689
0:36:59,4 --> 0:37:0,93
And your skin starts
aging because it


690
0:37:0,93 --> 0:37:5,43
loses its cytoskeletal
structure, that's


691
0:37:5,43 --> 0:37:9,6
supported and makes
it plump and gives it


692
0:37:9,6 --> 0:37:12,8
a body-- just like
when you were born


693
0:37:12,8 --> 0:37:16,87
and had a plump face and
plump skin everywhere.


694
0:37:16,87 --> 0:37:21,25
You want to retain that,
you have to eat really


695
0:37:21,25 --> 0:37:24,92
food rich, rich,
rich, in antioxidants.


696
0:37:24,92 --> 0:37:27,74
Every meal should be
rich in antioxidants


697
0:37:27,74 --> 0:37:30,42
because today you're
exposed to so many toxins


698
0:37:30,42 --> 0:37:33,35
that they increase the
[INAUDIBLE] damage.


699
0:37:33,35 --> 0:37:36,11
It's not just the sun
that we blame on aging.


700
0:37:36,11 --> 0:37:39,63
The sun is one source of
[INAUDIBLE] in our skin,


701
0:37:39,63 --> 0:37:42,26
but our diet is
another big source.


702
0:37:42,26 --> 0:37:44,84
Whenever you eat
rancid fats, you


703
0:37:44,84 --> 0:37:48,29
damage your subcutaneous
fat under the skin,


704
0:37:48,29 --> 0:37:52,1
and your skin ages prematurely.


705
0:37:52,1 --> 0:37:55,47
If you want to remove
protrusion and growths


706
0:37:55,47 --> 0:37:58,29
that occur as a
result of your diet


707
0:37:58,29 --> 0:38:1,87
or if you want to improve
the hormonal balance,


708
0:38:1,87 --> 0:38:4,28
so that you don't develop
tons and tons of skin tags


709
0:38:4,28 --> 0:38:5,75
on your neck and
under your breast


710
0:38:5,75 --> 0:38:11,39
and on your face, which you see
a lot of people suffering from.


711
0:38:11,39 --> 0:38:17,53
And if you don't want to have a
rough spots and dark areas that


712
0:38:17,53 --> 0:38:20,22
are caused by excessive
free radicals,


713
0:38:20,22 --> 0:38:21,85
you have to make changes.


714
0:38:21,85 --> 0:38:25,9
And then your body will be able
to handle stress a lot more.


715
0:38:25,9 --> 0:38:29,32
You can take some
adaptogenic herbs,


716
0:38:29,32 --> 0:38:32,72
which also help you handle
stress more effectively.


717
0:38:32,72 --> 0:38:34,4
But again, they're
not addressing


718
0:38:34,4 --> 0:38:36,26
the underlying problem.


719
0:38:36,26 --> 0:38:41,47
So, I truly recommend
to go back to nature,


720
0:38:41,47 --> 0:38:45,51
to learn from nature,
to come to the Himalayas


721
0:38:45,51 --> 0:38:48,24
to see what we're
doing out there,


722
0:38:48,24 --> 0:38:52,78
and get your stress level
down just by being in nature


723
0:38:52,78 --> 0:38:56,58
and by adapting a
purposeful life.


724
0:38:56,58 --> 0:38:59,11
That would make
your skin healthier,


725
0:38:59,11 --> 0:39:3,34
your skin lesions less likely
to appear, you can easily


726
0:39:3,34 --> 0:39:6,616
remove them and reduce the
stress of bad image problem


727
0:39:6,616 --> 0:39:7,99
when you look in
the mirror, when


728
0:39:7,99 --> 0:39:11,24
you have those huge
things on your nose.


729
0:39:11,24 --> 0:39:12,43
They can easily be removed.


730
0:39:12,43 --> 0:39:15,51
Don't tell me that you were born
with it; therefore, it's OK.


731
0:39:15,51 --> 0:39:17,1
Because if you're
born with it, it's


732
0:39:17,1 --> 0:39:18,635
been on you for a
longer amount of time


733
0:39:18,635 --> 0:39:20,55
and it's been exposed
more to the elements.


734
0:39:20,55 --> 0:39:22,73
It's even more risk.


735
0:39:22,73 --> 0:39:25,76
And if it's caused by the
neurological imbalance that


736
0:39:25,76 --> 0:39:28,6
makes some of those
protrusion occur,


737
0:39:28,6 --> 0:39:30,85
you can improve your
neurological state


738
0:39:30,85 --> 0:39:32,14
by removing them.


739
0:39:32,14 --> 0:39:33,88
Improving the
balance of your body.


740
0:39:33,88 --> 0:39:36,84
Your symmetry of
information that comes,


741
0:39:36,84 --> 0:39:39,77
sensory information that
comes into your brain.


742
0:39:39,77 --> 0:39:43,91
There are many reasons to
improve the skin appearance.


743
0:39:43,91 --> 0:39:46,39
Not just your image.


744
0:39:46,39 --> 0:39:48,44
Your skin is the
mirror off your health.


745
0:39:48,44 --> 0:39:52,2
The integrity of this barrier
between the inside of our body


746
0:39:52,2 --> 0:39:53,99
and the environment
outside of us.


747
0:39:53,99 --> 0:39:57,47
That integrity is
crucial and it tells us


748
0:39:57,47 --> 0:40:0,28
a lot about the integrity
of your entire body, which


749
0:40:0,28 --> 0:40:2,14
is made of barriers.


750
0:40:2,14 --> 0:40:5,78
The blood brain barrier,
the digestive barrier,


751
0:40:5,78 --> 0:40:7,86
the cellular membrane,
as a barrier.


752
0:40:7,86 --> 0:40:12,8
All of those barriers must be
healthy for you to be alive.


753
0:40:12,8 --> 0:40:14,8
And of course, they have
to be healthy in order


754
0:40:14,8 --> 0:40:16,88
for you to be healthy.


755
0:40:16,88 --> 0:40:20,9
If the, skin as a barrier,
has lost its integrity,


756
0:40:20,9 --> 0:40:24,97
also other barriers, which share
the same type of nutrition,


757
0:40:24,97 --> 0:40:26,8
are going to lose
their integrity,


758
0:40:26,8 --> 0:40:30,71
and you lose your health
on so many levels.


759
0:40:30,71 --> 0:40:37,84
Keep your integrity of the
barriers, of your life,


760
0:40:37,84 --> 0:40:43,32
of the purpose, of the
participation in making


761
0:40:43,32 --> 0:40:47,63
this world, this earth,
a better place, and then,


762
0:40:47,63 --> 0:40:49,57
your stress level will
go down because you


763
0:40:49,57 --> 0:40:52,52
will learn what's really
important in life.


764
0:40:52,52 --> 0:40:56,96
And you will truly stop
sweating the small stuff


765
0:40:56,96 --> 0:41:0,21
that makes you worried
and stressed all the time.


766
0:41:0,21 --> 0:41:4,12
You can do your work and
be happy with the results


767
0:41:4,12 --> 0:41:6,87
because you know that
ultimately there's


768
0:41:6,87 --> 0:41:9,35
something greater,
something bigger,


769
0:41:9,35 --> 0:41:13,58
that you participate in to
leave a much better world


770
0:41:13,58 --> 0:41:17,22
for future generation so that
the legacy that each one of you


771
0:41:17,22 --> 0:41:23,33
has is a legacy worth having for
prosperity for many generations


772
0:41:23,33 --> 0:41:24,687
into the future.


773
0:41:24,687 --> 0:41:25,52
Thank you very much.


774
0:41:25,52 --> 0:41:34,249
AUDIENCE: Are you working
with other organizations


775
0:41:34,249 --> 0:41:36,4
like Soroptimist
International and the U.N.


776
0:41:36,4 --> 0:41:38,2
with the children's issue?


777
0:41:38,2 --> 0:41:40,16
And, if so, what companies?


778
0:41:40,16 --> 0:41:42,77
Soroptimist has been around
since the 1920s, was founded


779
0:41:42,77 --> 0:41:45,92
in Oakland by women that
weren't allowed into rotary.


780
0:41:45,92 --> 0:41:47,48
And trafficking
of women and girls


781
0:41:47,48 --> 0:41:48,854
has always been
something they've


782
0:41:48,854 --> 0:41:51,76
worked on both internationally,
nationally, and locally.


783
0:41:51,76 --> 0:41:53,1
They help women and children.


784
0:41:53,1 --> 0:41:58,19
DR. TEL-OREN: At the
moment we are fairly young.


785
0:41:58,19 --> 0:42:1,55
We've only been around
for 3 and 1/2 years.


786
0:42:1,55 --> 0:42:6,44
And it's been so far
sort of a one man show.


787
0:42:6,44 --> 0:42:10,36
And I have no time,
really, to get involved


788
0:42:10,36 --> 0:42:13,63
with other organizations but
I wish I did have that time.


789
0:42:13,63 --> 0:42:15,29
And I need more
people to help me


790
0:42:15,29 --> 0:42:17,89
make the connection
because I'm limited.


791
0:42:17,89 --> 0:42:22,76
I'm just one person who's seeing
patients nonstop and giving


792
0:42:22,76 --> 0:42:27,28
lectures 250 times a year
in several continents.


793
0:42:27,28 --> 0:42:32,47
I travel all the time, and
educate, and teach, and treat


794
0:42:32,47 --> 0:42:37,44
and write, and travel,
and guide treks in Nepal.


795
0:42:37,44 --> 0:42:41,23
I just don't have the
time, or the capability,


796
0:42:41,23 --> 0:42:48,12
or the knowledge to do this this
administrative, important work,


797
0:42:48,12 --> 0:42:50,21
that is connecting with
other organizations that


798
0:42:50,21 --> 0:42:50,613
are pre-existing.


799
0:42:50,613 --> 0:42:52,655
AUDIENCE: Well, I'd be happy
to connect you [INAUDIBLE].


800
0:42:52,655 --> 0:42:53,655
DR. TEL-OREN: Thank you.


801
0:42:53,655 --> 0:42:55,792
Any help is always
welcome, as long


802
0:42:55,792 --> 0:42:58,83
as it doesn't add more
stuff on my table.


803
0:42:58,83 --> 0:43:1,19
So, whoever wants
to help, please


804
0:43:1,19 --> 0:43:4,21
help in a meaningful way
that can make things really


805
0:43:4,21 --> 0:43:5,83
change for the better.


806
0:43:5,83 --> 0:43:7,52
We have to activate
as many people


807
0:43:7,52 --> 0:43:9,82
as we can to make this work.


808
0:43:9,82 --> 0:43:12,42
We have a wonderful
staff in Nepal


809
0:43:12,42 --> 0:43:15,37
that made it possible to grow
to 5,000 children in just 3


810
0:43:15,37 --> 0:43:16,61
and 1/2 years.


811
0:43:16,61 --> 0:43:17,97
It's just unbelievable.


812
0:43:17,97 --> 0:43:20,41
It's above and beyond
my wildest imagination.


813
0:43:20,41 --> 0:43:24,22
I had no idea that we
would become, suddenly,


814
0:43:24,22 --> 0:43:27,16
an INGO, international
NGO, in Nepal.


815
0:43:27,16 --> 0:43:30,67
We can have our own office
of the Ecopolitan community


816
0:43:30,67 --> 0:43:31,85
from the United States.


817
0:43:31,85 --> 0:43:35,1
We can have a full-time
office now in Nepal,


818
0:43:35,1 --> 0:43:40,53
which we're going to
dedicate this March of 2014


819
0:43:40,53 --> 0:43:44,64
because of this new honor that
has been bestowed upon us.


820
0:43:44,64 --> 0:43:49,39
So, we are humbled by that, but
with a lot of responsibility.


821
0:43:49,39 --> 0:43:51,33
We always want to
be sustainable.


822
0:43:51,33 --> 0:43:53,89
We don't want to pluck
daughters, or girls,


823
0:43:53,89 --> 0:43:57,86
or children from their
society and isolate them just


824
0:43:57,86 --> 0:43:58,84
to save them.


825
0:43:58,84 --> 0:44:2,8
We want to save the whole
community by organizing it


826
0:44:2,8 --> 0:44:5,17
sustainably, so that all
the girls in the community


827
0:44:5,17 --> 0:44:6,38
will not be trafficked.


828
0:44:6,38 --> 0:44:9,49
Instead of just save 20 or
30, put them in the house,


829
0:44:9,49 --> 0:44:12,73
and they will never go
back to their home society


830
0:44:12,73 --> 0:44:14,624
because they have
been isolated from it


831
0:44:14,624 --> 0:44:16,54
and they don't think
it's appropriate for them


832
0:44:16,54 --> 0:44:18,21
to go back to the village.


833
0:44:18,21 --> 0:44:21,4
And then, other girls in the
village who are less fortunate


834
0:44:21,4 --> 0:44:22,97
end up trafficked instead.


835
0:44:22,97 --> 0:44:24,56
Some organizations do that.


836
0:44:24,56 --> 0:44:26,28
They have great
intention, but we


837
0:44:26,28 --> 0:44:30,19
are trying to change society
by organizing the communities


838
0:44:30,19 --> 0:44:32,35
with their own
participation, so they


839
0:44:32,35 --> 0:44:34,66
can take pride in
what they're doing.


840
0:44:34,66 --> 0:44:38,21
And we need help in that
direction, as much as we can.


841
0:44:38,21 --> 0:44:40,58
What we mostly need
right now is money.


842
0:44:40,58 --> 0:44:44,71
AUDIENCE: I have two
part question, actually.


843
0:44:44,71 --> 0:44:46,99
Number one, is about the
trek that you mentioned


844
0:44:46,99 --> 0:44:51,38
that happens in March and
October-- or November,


845
0:44:51,38 --> 0:44:51,94
I'm not sure.


846
0:44:51,94 --> 0:44:54,16
I want to learn a little
bit more about that.


847
0:44:54,16 --> 0:44:57,53
And the second question
is, being born and raised


848
0:44:57,53 --> 0:45:1,76
in Kathmandu, I would just like
to learn a little bit about how


849
0:45:1,76 --> 0:45:5,51
you view the stress level,
the health quality, and just


850
0:45:5,51 --> 0:45:6,21
quality of life.


851
0:45:6,21 --> 0:45:9,0
Meaning, people that are living
in rural Nepal versus somebody


852
0:45:9,0 --> 0:45:10,83
that's living in the city.


853
0:45:10,83 --> 0:45:12,72
DR. TEL-OREN: Excellent
question and I often


854
0:45:12,72 --> 0:45:15,9
lecture about it when
I have more time.


855
0:45:15,9 --> 0:45:17,42
Differentiating what
happens to the children


856
0:45:17,42 --> 0:45:19,98
who migrate to the city.


857
0:45:19,98 --> 0:45:21,95
And it's usually
the young people


858
0:45:21,95 --> 0:45:24,16
who are looking for
some opportunity who


859
0:45:24,16 --> 0:45:26,44
go to Kathmandu where all
the tourists are so there's


860
0:45:26,44 --> 0:45:28,75
a little more money,
there's more action,


861
0:45:28,75 --> 0:45:32,95
there are more hospitals, and
more educational facilities


862
0:45:32,95 --> 0:45:35,8
that provide
greater opportunity.


863
0:45:35,8 --> 0:45:37,27
Unfortunately, when
they go to the city,


864
0:45:37,27 --> 0:45:39,27
they also lose their culture.


865
0:45:39,27 --> 0:45:43,26
Many times the ethnicities,
the beautiful Nepali culture,


866
0:45:43,26 --> 0:45:47,69
gets dissolved into the
foreigners, and the pollution,


867
0:45:47,69 --> 0:45:51,67
and the population overload
that occurs in the city.


868
0:45:51,67 --> 0:45:54,47
And also, their health
starts deteriorating.


869
0:45:54,47 --> 0:45:57,24
They start eating more
like the Westerners.


870
0:45:57,24 --> 0:46:1,22
They want to emulate the
Westerners if they can.


871
0:46:1,22 --> 0:46:6,17
So, they start eating a lot
higher on the food chain.


872
0:46:6,17 --> 0:46:9,92
They start eating a lot less
plants and a lot more animals,


873
0:46:9,92 --> 0:46:13,79
which they could never
afford in rural Nepal.


874
0:46:13,79 --> 0:46:15,61
They start having
some of the symptoms


875
0:46:15,61 --> 0:46:17,79
that I see with Americans.


876
0:46:17,79 --> 0:46:21,2
A little more belly, a little
more diabetes, little more


877
0:46:21,2 --> 0:46:24,1
skin disorders, they
start losing their hair.


878
0:46:24,1 --> 0:46:28,19
I never see bald people who
are truly in rural Nepal,


879
0:46:28,19 --> 0:46:32,22
but in the city I see
a lot of bald people.


880
0:46:32,22 --> 0:46:34,38
All kinds of changes
happen when they


881
0:46:34,38 --> 0:46:39,23
increase too much their
level of protein intake,


882
0:46:39,23 --> 0:46:41,47
especially from animals sources.


883
0:46:41,47 --> 0:46:43,72
And I'm not telling people
that they have to be vegan.


884
0:46:43,72 --> 0:46:45,19
Nepalis are never vegan.


885
0:46:45,19 --> 0:46:47,45
Even if they live
in rural Nepal,


886
0:46:47,45 --> 0:46:49,47
they eat animals once in awhile.


887
0:46:49,47 --> 0:46:51,38
But very rarely
can they afford it.


888
0:46:51,38 --> 0:46:56,97
They reserve it for special
celebrations, special holidays.


889
0:46:56,97 --> 0:47:0,9
Tihar, Dashain, and
other special festivals.


890
0:47:0,9 --> 0:47:3,17
That's when they do that.


891
0:47:3,17 --> 0:47:5,87
But as soon as they go to the
city and they can afford it,


892
0:47:5,87 --> 0:47:9,8
they start partaking
of the cheap flesh that


893
0:47:9,8 --> 0:47:11,9
comes from factory
farming of the animals.


894
0:47:11,9 --> 0:47:15,909
And that could never
be healthy for them.


895
0:47:15,909 --> 0:47:17,7
And we see the differences
in their health,


896
0:47:17,7 --> 0:47:19,408
and in their mindset,
and their attitude.


897
0:47:19,408 --> 0:47:22,39
I did some studies
with vitamin D level,


898
0:47:22,39 --> 0:47:24,64
and even though Kathmandu
is still the city


899
0:47:24,64 --> 0:47:28,14
and its polluted
and populated, I've


900
0:47:28,14 --> 0:47:32,42
seen the highest level of
vitamin D in Nepal much higher


901
0:47:32,42 --> 0:47:35,84
than anything I've seen in the
United States even in Florida.


902
0:47:35,84 --> 0:47:39,87
And in Israel, the sunny country
of Israel, where 99% of people


903
0:47:39,87 --> 0:47:43,19
are vitamin D deficient,
but in Nepal they


904
0:47:43,19 --> 0:47:46,3
had a much higher,
healthier level of vitamin D


905
0:47:46,3 --> 0:47:51,25
even though they use
umbrellas and there are foggy


906
0:47:51,25 --> 0:47:55,18
times during the monsoon
season, and pollution,


907
0:47:55,18 --> 0:47:58,35
and they don't like the sun
because they want to be whiter.


908
0:47:58,35 --> 0:48:0,84
They're afraid of
becoming darker.


909
0:48:0,84 --> 0:48:4,176
They want to be more
like the foreigners.


910
0:48:4,176 --> 0:48:6,3
As a result, they don't
have that much sun exposure


911
0:48:6,3 --> 0:48:8,48
but yet they still
have much higher level


912
0:48:8,48 --> 0:48:11,1
of vitamin D, which
again is something


913
0:48:11,1 --> 0:48:13,7
that could be interesting
for us to study.


914
0:48:13,7 --> 0:48:15,15
Why is that?


915
0:48:15,15 --> 0:48:17,38
Why are they healthier
on that level?


916
0:48:17,38 --> 0:48:21,26
Because vitamin D protects
you from 25 types of cancer,


917
0:48:21,26 --> 0:48:25,14
and diabetes, and obesity,
cardiovascular disease.


918
0:48:25,14 --> 0:48:26,87
And people here are deficient.


919
0:48:26,87 --> 0:48:28,88
And people here take
supplements and they still


920
0:48:28,88 --> 0:48:30,832
have lower level
of vitamin D, then


921
0:48:30,832 --> 0:48:33,4
Nepalis who don't even know
that there's such a thing


922
0:48:33,4 --> 0:48:35,25
called vitamin D. And
they would definitely


923
0:48:35,25 --> 0:48:37,501
never take supplements because
they can't afford them.


924
0:48:37,501 --> 0:48:39,83
And they don't even
know what the test


925
0:48:39,83 --> 0:48:40,74
is because they can't
afford the test.


926
0:48:40,74 --> 0:48:45,59
So, I had to send their
blood from Kathmandu to India


927
0:48:45,59 --> 0:48:47,19
to test their
vitamin D 11 level.


928
0:48:47,19 --> 0:48:48,74
It doesn't exist it Nepal.


929
0:48:48,74 --> 0:48:50,63
And they all have
vitamin D level far,


930
0:48:50,63 --> 0:48:55,7
far higher than Americans do
in the southernmost states


931
0:48:55,7 --> 0:48:56,81
of the United States.


932
0:48:56,81 --> 0:48:59,4
So, this is another thing
that needs to be questioned.


933
0:48:59,4 --> 0:49:1,86
We need to really do
some good study using


934
0:49:1,86 --> 0:49:6,8
this amazing population
of kind-hearted people


935
0:49:6,8 --> 0:49:8,6
who want to always
give you everything


936
0:49:8,6 --> 0:49:13,14
they have to give with a smile,
no matter how little they have.


937
0:49:13,14 --> 0:49:17,27



938
0:49:17,27 --> 0:49:19,49
You could study
so much from them.


939
0:49:19,49 --> 0:49:22,58
We inspire them just because
we could travel to visit.


940
0:49:22,58 --> 0:49:25,37
But they can inspire us on
so many other levels that


941
0:49:25,37 --> 0:49:28,0
help us open our
heart and our mind


942
0:49:28,0 --> 0:49:31,52
to truly learn about
our world and be


943
0:49:31,52 --> 0:49:36,4
happy with little consumerism,
with little materialism,


944
0:49:36,4 --> 0:49:40,596
and learn to really enjoy
what is meaningful in life.


945
0:49:40,596 --> 0:49:42,594
So, thank you for that question.


946
0:49:42,594 --> 0:49:43,26
Did I answer it?


947
0:49:43,26 --> 0:49:46,248
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].


948
0:49:46,248 --> 0:49:47,85
DR. TEL-OREN: The trip.


949
0:49:47,85 --> 0:49:49,22
It's very simple.


950
0:49:49,22 --> 0:49:56,27
You go on nepali-children.org
or on trek4humanity.com.


951
0:49:56,27 --> 0:49:59,8
One of those two.


952
0:49:59,8 --> 0:50:2,82
And you read about it
and you send an email


953
0:50:2,82 --> 0:50:6,22
and then you get information
about how to join the treks.


954
0:50:6,22 --> 0:50:10,77
It's a 15 day trip, during
which you learn about Nepal--


955
0:50:10,77 --> 0:50:13,45
not you, of course, because
you know so much about it.


956
0:50:13,45 --> 0:50:17,88
But most people can
learn about Nepal


957
0:50:17,88 --> 0:50:20,26
as if they were
there for four months


958
0:50:20,26 --> 0:50:25,58
because during those 15 days,
I guide you incessantly.


959
0:50:25,58 --> 0:50:28,44
You'll get tired of my accent.


960
0:50:28,44 --> 0:50:32,3
You'll say, shut up already,
we learned enough for one


961
0:50:32,3 --> 0:50:34,25
day about Nepal.


962
0:50:34,25 --> 0:50:36,16
You will learn about
health, about nutrition,


963
0:50:36,16 --> 0:50:40,54
about sustainability,
about socioeconomic issues,


964
0:50:40,54 --> 0:50:44,1
about humanitarian
work, and you will also


965
0:50:44,1 --> 0:50:47,5
learn a lot about
Nepal that you can't


966
0:50:47,5 --> 0:50:51,51
learn in any regular trip
that is on the beaten path.


967
0:50:51,51 --> 0:50:53,92
We go to places where
tourists never go .


968
0:50:53,92 --> 0:50:56,63
We go to communities
that are never visited.


969
0:50:56,63 --> 0:50:58,9
We go to areas in the
countryside in the Himalayas


970
0:50:58,9 --> 0:51:3,35
that have amazing views and you
will never see another tourist.


971
0:51:3,35 --> 0:51:6,33
Plus, we visit,
during those 15 days,


972
0:51:6,33 --> 0:51:9,64
a lot of the communities that
the Ecopolitan communities


973
0:51:9,64 --> 0:51:12,779
service through the
Everest Learning Academy.


974
0:51:12,779 --> 0:51:13,82
You will meet the people.


975
0:51:13,82 --> 0:51:15,64
We also go to Chitwan
National Park.


976
0:51:15,64 --> 0:51:19,63
Come Some elephant ride in the
forest and see some animals


977
0:51:19,63 --> 0:51:24,74
and get into a nice little
resort and go into some temple,


978
0:51:24,74 --> 0:51:26,91
so you can learn
about the culture


979
0:51:26,91 --> 0:51:28,28
and you learn about the people.


980
0:51:28,28 --> 0:51:32,38
We also do our Touching
the Untouchable program.


981
0:51:32,38 --> 0:51:35,46
That I started two
years ago to help


982
0:51:35,46 --> 0:51:41,81
break the ancient caste
system and the prejudice


983
0:51:41,81 --> 0:51:43,35
of the caste system.


984
0:51:43,35 --> 0:51:46,6
Even though the government
of Nepal has abolished it,


985
0:51:46,6 --> 0:51:49,5
in the rural part of the country
they still practice the caste


986
0:51:49,5 --> 0:51:50,72
system, to some extent .


987
0:51:50,72 --> 0:51:53,98
And we try to break
through that by blending


988
0:51:53,98 --> 0:51:56,3
the different castes
together with the tourists,


989
0:51:56,3 --> 0:52:0,63
with the groups, in a very
beautiful ceremony that allows


990
0:52:0,63 --> 0:52:4,465
us to share with them
foods and drink and touch


991
0:52:4,465 --> 0:52:8,3
them, and massage
them, and hug them.


992
0:52:8,3 --> 0:52:12,97
And it shocks them because
they're the untouchables.


993
0:52:12,97 --> 0:52:18,2
And they are so unexpecting
when that happens.


994
0:52:18,2 --> 0:52:19,74
It's just an amazing
thing to see.


995
0:52:19,74 --> 0:52:22,17
Every time we take
new groups so it's


996
0:52:22,17 --> 0:52:24,83
a fresh new experience
with the Touching


997
0:52:24,83 --> 0:52:26,77
the Untouchable program,
which I really hope


998
0:52:26,77 --> 0:52:29,21
will end this caste
prejudice forever


999
0:52:29,21 --> 0:52:33,13
in practice, as well as in law.


1000
0:52:33,13 --> 0:52:35,84
People who are interested
in joining the trek


1001
0:52:35,84 --> 0:52:40,18
can be sponsored by other
people on the website


1002
0:52:40,18 --> 0:52:44,12
trek4humanity.com
there is this option.


1003
0:52:44,12 --> 0:52:47,52
Just like people do the
walkathon, the MS-a-thon,


1004
0:52:47,52 --> 0:52:50,86
and so on, you could come
there and you're coming


1005
0:52:50,86 --> 0:52:53,57
is by itself
supporting the effort


1006
0:52:53,57 --> 0:52:55,68
because most of
the money actually


1007
0:52:55,68 --> 0:53:0,4
goes towards the activities of
the Everest Learning Academy.


1008
0:53:0,4 --> 0:53:4,267
And so, people can support
you, can sponsor you.


1009
0:53:4,267 --> 0:53:6,6
As many friends as you have
can sponsor you with as much


1010
0:53:6,6 --> 0:53:10,33
as they want, and that
allows you to come and also


1011
0:53:10,33 --> 0:53:14,37
to contribute more to Nepal and
also have the matching program


1012
0:53:14,37 --> 0:53:15,19
work with that.


1013
0:53:15,19 --> 0:53:17,21
So, it's a win-win-win
for everybody


1014
0:53:17,21 --> 0:53:19,28
and I really want
to thank Google


1015
0:53:19,28 --> 0:53:21,82
for being on that
matching program list.


1016
0:53:21,82 --> 0:53:27,88
I have to say that also Apple,
and Microsoft, and Oracle,


1017
0:53:27,88 --> 0:53:30,84
and Boeing Corporation are
all on our matching program


1018
0:53:30,84 --> 0:53:34,5
for the Ecopolitan
Eco-Health Community.


1019
0:53:34,5 --> 0:53:37,9
But Google has a great
program and we truly, truly


1020
0:53:37,9 --> 0:53:39,424
thank Google for having that.


1021
0:53:39,424 --> 0:53:41,34
MALE SPEAKER: For the
benefit of the audience,


1022
0:53:41,34 --> 0:53:43,89
I think that it will
be great to introduce


1023
0:53:43,89 --> 0:53:46,41
about the Himalayan,
high sulfur, black salts


1024
0:53:46,41 --> 0:53:47,16
that you bring in.


1025
0:53:47,16 --> 0:53:49,17
DR. TEL-OREN: Thank
you, I forgot about it.


1026
0:53:49,17 --> 0:53:52,49
I did mention the sulfur
earlier and how important


1027
0:53:52,49 --> 0:53:54,86
it is for the skin
health, but I forgot


1028
0:53:54,86 --> 0:53:57,39
to continue on that
idea, which is really


1029
0:53:57,39 --> 0:54:1,34
the sulfur-rich, black
salt from the Himalayas.


1030
0:54:1,34 --> 0:54:3,76
It's made in Nepal
in a factory that I


1031
0:54:3,76 --> 0:54:8,42
built in Kathmandu
that, basically,


1032
0:54:8,42 --> 0:54:10,95
has all of it's
profits supporting


1033
0:54:10,95 --> 0:54:13,86
the children and the activities
of the Everest Learning


1034
0:54:13,86 --> 0:54:14,9
Academy.


1035
0:54:14,9 --> 0:54:17,55
So, when you eat this
sulfur-rich salt,


1036
0:54:17,55 --> 0:54:19,716
which tastes like
eggs, by the way.


1037
0:54:19,716 --> 0:54:21,84
So you add it to a vegetable
and suddenly it tastes


1038
0:54:21,84 --> 0:54:23,52
like an egg salad.


1039
0:54:23,52 --> 0:54:26,63
You add it to a sandwich, it
tastes like an egg sandwich.


1040
0:54:26,63 --> 0:54:31,5
You add it to an avocado and
you want to melt from pleasure.


1041
0:54:31,5 --> 0:54:33,5
You can add it to anything.


1042
0:54:33,5 --> 0:54:36,1
It's kind of addictive
because it's so tasty,


1043
0:54:36,1 --> 0:54:37,94
but the sulfur is
extremely healthy


1044
0:54:37,94 --> 0:54:40,46
because it supports your
detoxification process,


1045
0:54:40,46 --> 0:54:43,72
called sulfation, and supports
the structure of your skin


1046
0:54:43,72 --> 0:54:48,28
and your hair, and nails, and
all of those structural organs


1047
0:54:48,28 --> 0:54:50,62
from ligaments,
tendons, to cartilage.


1048
0:54:50,62 --> 0:54:52,31
They all require sulfur.


1049
0:54:52,31 --> 0:54:55,27
So, this salt comes from
a very clean environment.


1050
0:54:55,27 --> 0:54:59,21
It is exactly nothing
more, nothing less,


1051
0:54:59,21 --> 0:55:2,48
than the pulverized
black crystals


1052
0:55:2,48 --> 0:55:6,34
of this special salt that
comes from the Himalayas.


1053
0:55:6,34 --> 0:55:9,63
And that's another way
to support our children


1054
0:55:9,63 --> 0:55:12,22
while supporting
your own health.


1055
0:55:12,22 --> 0:55:13,88
That's all it does.


1056
0:55:13,88 --> 0:55:16,852
Support the children
and your health.


1057
0:55:16,852 --> 0:55:19,22
MALE SPEAKER: You're
welcome to stay around.


1058
0:55:19,22 --> 0:55:22,7
Dr. T will be happy to
answer questions if you have.


1059
0:55:22,7 --> 0:55:26,8
And now let's give
applause to Dr. T.


1060
0:55:26,8 --> 0:55:28,23
DR. TEL-OREN: Thank you.


1061
0:55:28,23 --> 0:57:28,23
