[MUSIC PLAYING]

0:0:19,149 --> 0:0:22,13
EDDY MORETTI: It's the first day
of shooting on the first


5
0:0:22,13 --> 0:0:26,12
film of the Grolsch Film Works
and Vice Films collaboration.


6
0:0:26,12 --> 0:0:28,66
We're in Nashville
in a roller rink.


7
0:0:28,66 --> 0:0:32,3
The first film is called "The
Filmic Fourth Dimension," and


8
0:0:32,3 --> 0:0:35,3
it's being shot by Harmony
Korine, who is over there.


9
0:0:35,3 --> 0:0:40,15
And the star of this chapter
is Val Kilmer, completely


10
0:0:40,15 --> 0:0:43,42
amazingly dressed
as Val Kilmer.


11
0:0:43,42 --> 0:0:48,23
And this is going to
be really good.


12
0:0:48,23 --> 0:0:51,22
VAL KILMER: I'm going to
bleed for this film.


13
0:0:51,22 --> 0:0:54,29
HARMONY KORINE: I had always
wanted to write a film that


14
0:0:54,29 --> 0:0:55,8
was almost like a stage play.


15
0:0:55,8 --> 0:0:58,89
But it was presented in the form
of a motivational speech.


16
0:0:58,89 --> 0:1:1,29
And with this idea that the
person only would give the


17
0:1:1,29 --> 0:1:4,79
most paranoid advice, or the
most tangential advice, or the


18
0:1:4,79 --> 0:1:5,519
most random.


19
0:1:5,519 --> 0:1:8,18
And it's really based on this
one central monologue.


20
0:1:8,18 --> 0:1:10,164
[LAUGHTER]


21
0:1:10,164 --> 0:1:10,91
VAL KILMER: Can you see it?


22
0:1:10,91 --> 0:1:11,83
It's like an alien ship.


23
0:1:11,83 --> 0:1:12,33
Can you see it?


24
0:1:12,33 --> 0:1:12,83
FEMALE SPEAKER: I see it!


25
0:1:12,83 --> 0:1:13,33
VAL KILMER: Look up!

0:1:15,33 --> 0:1:15,83

0:1:15,83 --> 0:1:16,33
Sit down!


32
0:1:16,33 --> 0:1:17,85
HARMONY KORINE: I thought if I
could have anyone to do it,


33
0:1:17,85 --> 0:1:19,6
who would it be?


34
0:1:19,6 --> 0:1:22,48
And I kept thinking about Val
Kilmer with like a Bluetooth


35
0:1:22,48 --> 0:1:28,56
microphone on stage, and a pony
tail, and a beret, and,


36
0:1:28,56 --> 0:1:31,12
just giving amazing
advice to people.


37
0:1:31,12 --> 0:1:32,64
VAL KILMER: It's cool that
I'm here for you.


38
0:1:32,64 --> 0:1:34,74

that you're here for me.


39
0:1:34,74 --> 0:1:36,864
I want you so bad.


40
0:1:36,864 --> 0:1:38,25
I want you.


41
0:1:38,25 --> 0:1:38,82

0:1:38,82 --> 0:1:41,22
[CHEERING]


43
0:1:41,22 --> 0:1:45,54
VAL KILMER: He liked some
of my improv ideas.


44
0:1:45,54 --> 0:1:48,42
Some things sort of come
out like a chant.


45
0:1:48,42 --> 0:1:51,664
ALL: Awesome secret,
awesome secret.


46
0:1:51,664 --> 0:1:52,88
VAL KILMER: Awesome secrets!


47
0:1:52,88 --> 0:1:54,13
Awesome secrets!

0:1:55,579 --> 0:1:57,28

50
0:1:57,28 --> 0:1:58,96
Awesome secrets, they
now come true!

0:1:58,96 --> 0:2:0,892
Awesome secrets, they
now come true!


52
0:2:0,892 --> 0:2:2,341

0:2:2,341 --> 0:2:5,25
Awesome secrets, they
now come true!


54
0:2:5,25 --> 0:2:9,57
There were some very natural
catch phrases almost.


55
0:2:9,57 --> 0:2:12,3
So I started thinking about that
as an idea of actually


56
0:2:12,3 --> 0:2:15,1
thinking about catch phrases.


57
0:2:15,1 --> 0:2:17,6
You know what my catch
phase for today is?


58
0:2:17,6 --> 0:2:17,41
EDDY MORETTI: No.


59
0:2:17,41 --> 0:2:19,504
VAL KILMER: Catch phrase.


60
0:2:19,504 --> 0:2:20,46
EDDY MORETTI: That's a
good catch phrase.


61
0:2:20,46 --> 0:2:21,416
I like it.


62
0:2:21,416 --> 0:2:22,37
VAL KILMER: Yeah.


63
0:2:22,37 --> 0:2:24,5
It's a catch phrase,
is catch phrase.


64
0:2:24,5 --> 0:2:25,57
Catch phrase.


65
0:2:25,57 --> 0:2:27,31
HARMONY KORINE: I kind of wrote
it thinking about him.


66
0:2:27,31 --> 0:2:29,53
It's not really a character
as much as it's the way I


67
0:2:29,53 --> 0:2:31,94
reimagined Val Kilmer.


68
0:2:31,94 --> 0:2:33,9
If I could have Val be
anything, that's


69
0:2:33,9 --> 0:2:34,98
what he would be.


70
0:2:34,98 --> 0:2:37,34
VAL KILMER: It's a motivational
speaker, but it's


71
0:2:37,34 --> 0:2:39,3
me, but not really me.


72
0:2:39,3 --> 0:2:40,89
And I just loved it.


73
0:2:40,89 --> 0:2:47,69
So it's really been fun kind
of creating this outrageous


74
0:2:47,69 --> 0:2:48,922
character together.


75
0:2:48,922 --> 0:2:49,35
Hold it in!


76
0:2:49,35 --> 0:2:51,96
Hold it in until we begin!


77
0:2:51,96 --> 0:2:54,52
You don't want to give
it all away.


78
0:2:54,52 --> 0:2:54,91
Look at me.


79
0:2:54,91 --> 0:2:55,56
Focus.


80
0:2:55,56 --> 0:3:0,57
I've got to focus now like a
Ninja, like a white Ninja.


81
0:3:0,57 --> 0:3:1,55
Do you feel it?


82
0:3:1,55 --> 0:3:2,296
FEMALE SPEAKER: Uh-huh.


83
0:3:2,296 --> 0:3:5,336

vibe jack right now.


84
0:3:5,336 --> 0:3:10,166
[LAUGHTER]


85
0:3:10,166 --> 0:3:12,8
HARMONY KORINE: I didn't know
what to expect, or what his


86
0:3:12,8 --> 0:3:14,47
process was, or how he
wanted to do it.


87
0:3:14,47 --> 0:3:17,3
But I can't tell the difference
when I talk to him.


88
0:3:17,3 --> 0:3:19,67
I don't know if he's,
like, motivational


89
0:3:19,67 --> 0:3:21,97
speaker, or if it's Val.


90
0:3:21,97 --> 0:3:22,72
VAL KILMER: Harmony!


91
0:3:22,72 --> 0:3:23,698
HARMONY KORINE: Yeah.


92
0:3:23,698 --> 0:3:29,566
VAL KILMER: I don't know about
you, but I'm already filming.


93

94
0:3:33,0 --> 0:3:36,97
HARMONY KORINE: Like, I can't
tell, like, where Val ends and


95
0:3:36,97 --> 0:3:39,11
this guy begins.


96
0:3:39,11 --> 0:3:39,38
VAL KILMER: Come in.


97
0:3:39,38 --> 0:3:42,995
We take a vibe jack.


98
0:3:42,995 --> 0:3:44,58
Then you do an insert.


99
0:3:44,58 --> 0:3:45,83
I turn away.


100
0:3:45,83 --> 0:3:48,204



101
0:3:48,204 --> 0:3:49,454
And I return.


102
0:3:49,454 --> 0:3:52,4



103
0:3:52,4 --> 0:3:56,28
EDDY MORETTI: You've uplifted
her for sure.


104
0:3:56,28 --> 0:3:57,939
FEMALE SPEAKER: This is the
best thing that's ever


105
0:3:57,939 --> 0:4:1,2
happened to me.


106
0:4:1,2 --> 0:4:2,675
VAL KILMER: That's correct.

0:4:3,98 --> 0:4:4,455
HARMONY KORINE: It's crazy.


109
0:4:4,455 --> 0:4:5,98
Because it feels like
I'm dreaming.


110
0:4:5,98 --> 0:4:8,916
Like, when I see Val riding
a BMX bike with


111
0:4:8,916 --> 0:4:11,23
what, like, MAG wheels?


112
0:4:11,23 --> 0:4:11,366
EDDY MORETTI: Yeah.


113
0:4:11,366 --> 0:4:13,33
HARMONY KORINE: And
like a fanny pack.


114
0:4:13,33 --> 0:4:14,56
It's so great.


115
0:4:14,56 --> 0:4:15,81
It's so trippy.


116
0:4:15,81 --> 0:4:20,99



117
0:4:20,99 --> 0:4:22,43
I would like to think
that that's what


118
0:4:22,43 --> 0:4:24,31
Val Kilmer does now.


119
0:4:24,31 --> 0:4:26,79
In my mind, I'd like to imagine
that's, like, what


120
0:4:26,79 --> 0:4:27,36
he's doing.


121
0:4:27,36 --> 0:4:29,595
VAL KILMER: He's so enthusiastic
in general.


122
0:4:29,595 --> 0:4:32,955
He's so refreshing because he's
excited about everything


123
0:4:32,955 --> 0:4:37,2
and doesn't have any creative
blocks at all.


124
0:4:37,2 --> 0:4:39,5
He reminds me a lot of my little
brother, who is very,


125
0:4:39,5 --> 0:4:41,22
very free as an artist.


126
0:4:41,22 --> 0:4:42,765
HARMONY KORINE: If you were
like this now, like if you


127
0:4:42,765 --> 0:4:45,572
hold it by the scruff of it's
neck and be like [SCREAMING]


128
0:4:45,572 --> 0:4:46,468
come on, Val!


129
0:4:46,468 --> 0:4:48,3
I'm waiting for you!


130
0:4:48,3 --> 0:4:50,64
Like that, all right?


131
0:4:50,64 --> 0:4:52,66
I don't know what it is, it's
like a performance, or a


132
0:4:52,66 --> 0:4:54,99
prank, or a film, or a play.


133
0:4:54,99 --> 0:4:57,96
I've never made something that
was like this before.


134
0:4:57,96 --> 0:4:59,76
Also that was like a
live audience that


135
0:4:59,76 --> 0:5:1,22
was reacting to something.


136
0:5:1,22 --> 0:5:4,79
So what's going to happen is
he's going to give this


137
0:5:4,79 --> 0:5:5,183
performance.


138
0:5:5,183 --> 0:5:7,46
And he's going to be free.


139
0:5:7,46 --> 0:5:8,6
And he's going to
be all around.


140
0:5:8,6 --> 0:5:10,54
He's going to react.


141
0:5:10,54 --> 0:5:14,5
And I want you guys to react
to what he does.


142
0:5:14,5 --> 0:5:15,65
I'm not going to tell
you too much.


143
0:5:15,65 --> 0:5:19,24
I want you to do what
you're going to do.


144
0:5:19,24 --> 0:5:22,92
VAL KILMER: Combining theater
experience with a movie and


145
0:5:22,92 --> 0:5:26,6
film it so that there's
two products.


146
0:5:26,6 --> 0:5:28,356
There's the real theater
that you're generating


147
0:5:28,356 --> 0:5:30,171
and then the film.


148
0:5:30,171 --> 0:5:33,41
MALE SPEAKER: You know the
character in "Tropic Thunder"


149
0:5:33,41 --> 0:5:38,73
that arranges all the explosions
for the film


150
0:5:38,73 --> 0:5:39,63
production?


151
0:5:39,63 --> 0:5:40,21
Well, he--


152
0:5:40,21 --> 0:5:44,9
Chris does that with
disco and lights.


153
0:5:44,9 --> 0:5:46,39
HARMONY KORINE: What I want
you to do is I want you to


154
0:5:46,39 --> 0:5:48,595
become an active participant
in the performance.


155
0:5:48,595 --> 0:5:49,25
MALE SPEAKER: That's great.


156
0:5:49,25 --> 0:5:49,81
HARMONY KORINE: Just
change it.


157
0:5:49,81 --> 0:5:51,6
Never let anything get
too comfortable.


158
0:5:51,6 --> 0:5:53,48
If anything feels like
it's getting too


159
0:5:53,48 --> 0:5:54,786
comfortable, switch up.


160
0:5:54,786 --> 0:5:55,142
MALE SPEAKER: All right.


161
0:5:55,142 --> 0:5:55,5
HARMONY KORINE: All right.


162
0:5:55,5 --> 0:5:56,45

0:5:56,45 --> 0:5:59,315

moment to shine, man.

[GROUP CHATTER]


165
0:6:3,28 --> 0:6:6,13
EDDY MORETTI: So Val said that
he didn't pick this place.


166
0:6:6,13 --> 0:6:9,22
This place picked him.


167
0:6:9,22 --> 0:6:10,67
And I kind of agree.


168
0:6:10,67 --> 0:6:13,115
The weird thing is that I'm
dressed exactly like him.


169
0:6:13,115 --> 0:6:14,36
VAL KILMER: Wait a minute.


170
0:6:14,36 --> 0:6:15,3
EDDY MORETTI: Yeah.


171
0:6:15,3 --> 0:6:15,93
Yeah, I know.


172
0:6:15,93 --> 0:6:16,245
Yeah.


173
0:6:16,245 --> 0:6:17,18
VAL KILMER: Hang on a second.


174
0:6:17,18 --> 0:6:17,9
EDDY MORETTI: Yeah.


175
0:6:17,9 --> 0:6:21,56
I was vibe jacking you
telepathically.


176
0:6:21,56 --> 0:6:24,1
But this is how I dress
every day, so.


177
0:6:24,1 --> 0:6:24,755
VAL KILMER: Me, too.


178
0:6:24,755 --> 0:6:25,21
EDDY MORETTI: Yeah.


179
0:6:25,21 --> 0:6:25,99
Oh, good.


180
0:6:25,99 --> 0:6:28,57
VAL KILMER: No, I got a little
dressed up because I'm giving


181
0:6:28,57 --> 0:6:29,696
a talk today.

0:6:33,7 --> 0:6:34,7
We love you!

0:6:34,7 --> 0:6:37,57
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]


186
0:6:37,57 --> 0:6:40,2
EDDY MORETTI: So this is where
the extras check in.


187
0:6:40,2 --> 0:6:41,74
There's about 150 extras.


188
0:6:41,74 --> 0:6:44,24
They're coming here
to be inspired and


189
0:6:44,24 --> 0:6:46,18
motivated by the outcome.


190
0:6:46,18 --> 0:6:49,4
Lots of people want to be extras
in the film because


191
0:6:49,4 --> 0:6:51,479
there's so many unemployed
people in Nashville, you know,


192
0:6:51,479 --> 0:6:53,63
that everyone's, like,
hell, yeah.


193
0:6:53,63 --> 0:6:57,14
I want to be an extra for $50
a day or whatever it is.


194
0:6:57,14 --> 0:7:1,79
But they don't really have any
ideas on how Val is going to


195
0:7:1,79 --> 0:7:2,78
really uplift them.


196
0:7:2,78 --> 0:7:4,53
HARMONY KORINE: I mean, we're
filming in a roller skating


197
0:7:4,53 --> 0:7:7,32
rink with a lot of people that
are down on their luck, a lot


198
0:7:7,32 --> 0:7:10,44
of unemployed people, thinking
that they're going to hear one


199
0:7:10,44 --> 0:7:12,42
of the great motivational
speakers.


200
0:7:12,42 --> 0:7:15,126
A lot of them need like
financial advice and da, da,


201
0:7:15,126 --> 0:7:15,66
da, da, da.


202
0:7:15,66 --> 0:7:17,81
But what's going to happen is
Val's going to come out and


203
0:7:17,81 --> 0:7:20,16
speak mostly in pure paranoia.


204
0:7:20,16 --> 0:7:22,4
EDDY MORETTI: But I think
there are also like real


205
0:7:22,4 --> 0:7:23,33
moments of kind of poetry.


206
0:7:23,33 --> 0:7:24,12
HARMONY KORINE: Yeah.


207
0:7:24,12 --> 0:7:25,77
EDDY MORETTI: And they're,
like, images.


208
0:7:25,77 --> 0:7:27,0
HARMONY KORINE: And they
go by very quick.


209
0:7:27,0 --> 0:7:27,79
They change.


210
0:7:27,79 --> 0:7:30,37
They go from being really stupid
to really profound.


211
0:7:30,37 --> 0:7:33,49
VAL KILMER: It very hard to
compare this to anything,


212
0:7:33,49 --> 0:7:38,54
particularly some of the
prankish elements in it where


213
0:7:38,54 --> 0:7:41,54
you wonder if it's
really me or not.


214
0:7:41,54 --> 0:7:45,68
I think that's what Harmony
was intending


215
0:7:45,68 --> 0:7:46,77
that's really veiled.


216
0:7:46,77 --> 0:7:50,0
But there's some serious
elements in my character


217
0:7:50,0 --> 0:7:55,37
really, very sincere about
wanting to help people.


218
0:7:55,37 --> 0:7:57,19
HARMONY KORINE: So we shot a
scene of Val and Rachel just


219
0:7:57,19 --> 0:7:57,93
riding bikes.


220
0:7:57,93 --> 0:8:0,91
And there was this van that was
parked in the back of the


221
0:8:0,91 --> 0:8:2,46
parking lot under a light.


222
0:8:2,46 --> 0:8:5,12
And then these two
guys came out.


223
0:8:5,12 --> 0:8:7,34
And Val start talking to
them, and we made a


224
0:8:7,34 --> 0:8:8,25
little scene happen.


225
0:8:8,25 --> 0:8:11,44
But it turns out that they
both are homeless.


226
0:8:11,44 --> 0:8:14,345
VAL KILMER: You're so
happy you're insane.


227
0:8:14,345 --> 0:8:16,865



228
0:8:16,865 --> 0:8:19,87
Have you ever been so happy
you're just almost insane?


229
0:8:19,87 --> 0:8:20,912
Just--


230
0:8:20,912 --> 0:8:21,3
MALE SPEAKER: No.


231
0:8:21,3 --> 0:8:24,34
VAL KILMER: Well, that's why
the Lotus Community Center


232
0:8:24,34 --> 0:8:27,211
might be for you.


233
0:8:27,211 --> 0:8:31,0
It just makes you so happy that
you're almost insane.


234
0:8:31,0 --> 0:8:33,85
It's like a happy campaign.


235
0:8:33,85 --> 0:8:35,515
HARMONY KORINE: It was a pretty
cool scene where Val


236
0:8:35,515 --> 0:8:39,669
used some of his illogical
wisdom and tried to help them.


237
0:8:39,669 --> 0:8:41,87
I don't know if it succeeded,
but it seemed like they were


238
0:8:41,87 --> 0:8:43,429
pretty excited.


239
0:8:43,429 --> 0:8:45,5
VAL KILMER: A lot of times the
biggest things in life are


240
0:8:45,5 --> 0:8:46,47
unexpected, right?


241
0:8:46,47 --> 0:8:48,94
They just seem to be random.


242
0:8:48,94 --> 0:8:54,74
And just like talking to you
two tonight, we had that


243
0:8:54,74 --> 0:8:55,6
experience.


244
0:8:55,6 --> 0:8:57,77
It's just like nothing
else in the world.


245
0:8:57,77 --> 0:9:0,746
It's like the most important
things right now.


246
0:9:0,746 --> 0:9:1,996
Thanks, man.


247
0:9:1,996 --> 0:9:5,39



248
0:9:5,39 --> 0:9:9,675
It's part of Harmony's world
where he doesn't judge.


249
0:9:9,675 --> 0:9:15,47
He kind of loves all life, and
particularly the back alleys


250
0:9:15,47 --> 0:9:17,2
where people have
been discarded.


251
0:9:17,2 --> 0:9:18,25
HARMONY KORINE: So
it was awesome.


252
0:9:18,25 --> 0:9:21,4
It was something really
beautiful just now.


253
0:9:21,4 --> 0:9:22,695
I'm just excited just
to see what happens.


254
0:9:22,695 --> 0:9:23,28
EDDY MORETTI: Yeah.


255
0:9:23,28 --> 0:9:24,39
HARMONY KORINE: I mean,
I think I have like


256
0:9:24,39 --> 0:9:25,26
a pretty good idea.


257
0:9:25,26 --> 0:9:30,25
But it'll be good.


258
0:9:30,25 --> 0:9:33,745
This guy is too genius.


259
0:9:33,745 --> 0:9:37,95
And a hero to the working man.


260
0:9:37,95 --> 0:9:39,9
He's one of the best.


261
0:9:39,9 --> 0:9:40,34
He's an icon.


262
0:9:40,34 --> 0:9:43,79



263
0:9:43,79 --> 0:9:48,27
It's also just very good to see
him actually, like, doing


264
0:9:48,27 --> 0:9:50,17
you know, good stuff.


265
0:9:50,17 --> 0:9:52,27
Like, you know what I mean?


266
0:9:52,27 --> 0:9:56,17
[LAUGHTER]


267
0:9:56,17 --> 0:11:56,17
