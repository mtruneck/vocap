0:0:1,53 --> 0:0:3,51
movies do you like--

let's say from the old days?

I like Japanese movies.

THOM DEVITA: No, really, I've
seen maybe five Japanese


7
0:0:11,71 --> 0:0:13,53
movies, and I disliked
liked all of them.

0:0:13,53 --> 0:0:15,56
I've seen maybe 10
Chinese movies.

care about calm.

There's nothing like them.

-No, I like him.

THOM DEVITA: He's an actor.


24
0:0:40,35 --> 0:0:42,83
Is he different from
the other actors?


25
0:0:42,83 --> 0:0:44,48
-Yeah, he's good.


26
0:0:44,48 --> 0:0:46,74
THOM DEVITA: I think
he's the best.

of that stuff was like


28

over-acted.

not over-acted.

0:0:53,193 --> 0:0:53,546
-It was.


33
0:0:53,546 --> 0:0:55,826
Compared to what they do today,
it was over-acted.

that with the--

didn't like Marlon Brando.

0:1:0,82 --> 0:1:2,839
I didn't like Marlon Brando.

made after the film noir

concerned.

THOM DEVITA: What you want to
see is Orson Welles in "A

movie have you seen?

art, music, film.

raised on the Upper East
Side in Harlem.


104

had a store of some kind--

whether it was a candy store or
fruits and vegetables, or

And he said in the '50s, he and
his brother were pickers.

East Side on garbage

would put furniture and other

objects out in front
of their buildings.

They earned about $200 a week,
a piece, and never

reported any of it.

together, either.

go downtown--

go to one of the arty places,
I guess Thom's brother said.

And Thom thought they were going
to see a guy named Arty.


167
0:6:36,44 --> 0:6:39,39
But Thom's brother wanted
to go to the art bars.

just making good time in that

really interesting life.


179
0:7:2,27 --> 0:7:4,73
And he used to hang his
paintings or his artwork on

0:7:4,73 --> 0:7:6,99

Square.

at the Cedar Bar.

0:7:55,73 --> 0:7:57,8
Yeah, exactly.


202
0:7:57,8 --> 0:7:58,85
Just like me.


203
0:7:58,85 --> 0:8:3,55
And how we got into tattooing,
I don't know.


204
0:8:3,55 --> 0:8:8,48
I think it was like a switch was
hit, I think, or maybe--


205
0:8:8,48 --> 0:8:8,99
I don't know.


206
0:8:8,99 --> 0:8:9,73
I can't tell you that.


207
0:8:9,73 --> 0:8:11,41
I can't answer the question.


208
0:8:11,41 --> 0:8:14,25
I recently learned that he got
his first tattoo when he was


209
0:8:14,25 --> 0:8:15,61
17 years old.


210
0:8:15,61 --> 0:8:19,425
Now, I had not known that.


211
0:8:19,425 --> 0:8:22,955
THOM DEVITA: That's
Charlie Wagner.


212
0:8:22,955 --> 0:8:25,68
MALE SPEAKER: Did you get
tattooed by Charlie?


213
0:8:25,68 --> 0:8:26,61
THOM DEVITA: No.


214
0:8:26,61 --> 0:8:28,66
No, I was 17.


215
0:8:28,66 --> 0:8:32,14
That's when I had gone into
Charlie Wagner for


216
0:8:32,14 --> 0:8:32,919
a snake and a skull.


217
0:8:32,919 --> 0:8:35,59
He says he wasn't
putting them on.


218
0:8:35,59 --> 0:8:37,39
ANGELO SCOTTO: You hear stories
about Charlie kind of


219
0:8:37,39 --> 0:8:40,9
hawking, like a barker
at a carnival.


220
0:8:40,9 --> 0:8:43,156
Kind of that hawking, come
here and get tattooed.


221
0:8:43,156 --> 0:8:45,46
He's probably one of the
originators of tattooing in


222
0:8:45,46 --> 0:8:46,18
New York City--


223
0:8:46,18 --> 0:8:47,205
on the Bowery.


224
0:8:47,205 --> 0:8:49,823
You hear stories, oh, I paid a
quarter for this, a bottle of


225
0:8:49,823 --> 0:8:50,93
Sneaky Pete.


226
0:8:50,93 --> 0:8:52,4
The stories were true.


227
0:8:52,4 --> 0:8:55,825
ED HARDY: Wagner was still on
the Bowery, and Thom wanted to


228
0:8:55,825 --> 0:8:57,36
get a dagger done from him.


229
0:8:57,36 --> 0:9:1,53
And Wagner said, I'm not doing
daggers this week.


230
0:9:1,53 --> 0:9:2,86
I'm doing ships.


231
0:9:2,86 --> 0:9:3,565
That's it.


232
0:9:3,565 --> 0:9:4,635
That's on the wall.


233
0:9:4,635 --> 0:9:5,45
It's a done deal.


234
0:9:5,45 --> 0:9:7,65
That's how the tattoo
shops were.


235
0:9:7,65 --> 0:9:10,1
It's like Henry Ford in the old
days-- any color you want


236
0:9:10,1 --> 0:9:11,2
as long as it's black.


237
0:9:11,2 --> 0:9:11,87
He had the market.


238
0:9:11,87 --> 0:9:13,3
He had the fucking cars.


239
0:9:13,3 --> 0:9:15,123
And if you wanted it, that's
how you got it.


240
0:9:15,123 --> 0:9:17,68
THOM DEVITA: So I went
down the block.


241
0:9:17,68 --> 0:9:19,45
I went down the block.


242
0:9:19,45 --> 0:9:21,38
And I got it from Moskowitz.


243
0:9:21,38 --> 0:9:22,67
-The old man, or the--


244
0:9:22,67 --> 0:9:23,95
THOM DEVITA: The old man.


245
0:9:23,95 --> 0:9:26,389
And the next time I went
down, he says the


246
0:9:26,389 --> 0:9:28,52
kid will put it on.


247
0:9:28,52 --> 0:9:31,279
And the kid looked like
he was younger than I


248
0:9:31,279 --> 0:9:33,482
was, and I was 17.


249
0:9:33,482 --> 0:9:35,842
I wanted a Moskowitz.


250
0:9:35,842 --> 0:9:38,68
Then I met him years later.


251
0:9:38,68 --> 0:9:40,971
He hadn't heard that story.


252
0:9:40,971 --> 0:9:43,326
He was [INAUDIBLE].


253
0:9:43,326 --> 0:9:44,268
Figured out [INAUDIBLE].


254
0:9:44,268 --> 0:9:45,518
He says, I remember you.


255
0:9:45,518 --> 0:9:48,5



256
0:9:48,5 --> 0:9:50,558
-Do you find it odd that Thom
started tattooing when he was


257
0:9:50,558 --> 0:9:52,37
in his late 30s?


258
0:9:52,37 --> 0:9:54,51
ANGELO SCOTTO: Well, Huck
Spaulding told me that Thom


259
0:9:54,51 --> 0:9:57,46
bought machines from
him years before--


260
0:9:57,46 --> 0:9:59,21
years before--


261
0:9:59,21 --> 0:10:0,49
and just kept them
in the drawer.


262
0:10:0,49 --> 0:10:2,74
That's what Huck Spaulding
told me.


263
0:10:2,74 --> 0:10:3,39
ED HARDY: He sent away.


264
0:10:3,39 --> 0:10:5,17
He had Spaulding's address.


265
0:10:5,17 --> 0:10:6,75
DeVita would always go,
"Spauldeen." He said, I wrote


266
0:10:6,75 --> 0:10:9,39
away to "Spauldeen" in Albany.


267
0:10:9,39 --> 0:10:10,56
And he gets these machines.


268
0:10:10,56 --> 0:10:12,3
He takes the rubber bands off.


269
0:10:12,3 --> 0:10:13,73
This must be packing material.


270
0:10:13,73 --> 0:10:16,73
I can't get this fucking
thing to work.


271
0:10:16,73 --> 0:10:19,18
So he called Huck.


272
0:10:19,18 --> 0:10:22,3
And then it came out in the
phone conversation.


273
0:10:22,3 --> 0:10:23,82
And Huck said, well, are the
rubber bands adjusted right?


274
0:10:23,82 --> 0:10:25,97
And he went, well, I thought
that was packing.


275
0:10:25,97 --> 0:10:28,28
I took them off.


276
0:10:28,28 --> 0:10:30,492
And the needle's
jumping around.


277
0:10:30,492 --> 0:10:34,14
He probably never got close
enough to watch somebody work.


278
0:10:34,14 --> 0:10:36,33
And people didn't like you
asking questions, anyway.


279
0:10:36,33 --> 0:10:38,41
Most tattooers, if you ask
questions, they throw you out.


280
0:10:38,41 --> 0:10:41,475
-If you ask him when he started
to tattoo, he just


281
0:10:41,475 --> 0:10:43,47
asked, what year did
it become illegal?


282
0:10:43,47 --> 0:10:46,31
ANGELO SCOTTO: 1961,
by Mayor Wagner.


283
0:10:46,31 --> 0:10:50,24
Charlie Wagner started it, and
Mayor Wagner finished it.


284
0:10:50,24 --> 0:10:52,93
JOHN WYATT: I saved a lot of
articles, and this is when


285
0:10:52,93 --> 0:10:54,22
tattooing was banned
in New York.


286
0:10:54,22 --> 0:10:55,98
That's Tony D'Anessa.


287
0:10:55,98 --> 0:11:1,42
It was banned in 1961, allegedly
over a health issue.


288
0:11:1,42 --> 0:11:4,45
And the tattoo artists that were
out of business opened up


289
0:11:4,45 --> 0:11:5,54
in other cities.


290
0:11:5,54 --> 0:11:7,1
ANGELO SCOTTO: And there was
only two places in the whole


291
0:11:7,1 --> 0:11:9,8
state of New York
to get tattooed.


292
0:11:9,8 --> 0:11:11,99
It was Huck Spaulding in Albany
and Stanley and Walter


293
0:11:11,99 --> 0:11:14,26
in Long Island, yeah,
when it was legal.


294
0:11:14,26 --> 0:11:17,56
-There are very few people in
New York in the late '60s and


295
0:11:17,56 --> 0:11:19,19
'70s that were doing tattoos.


296
0:11:19,19 --> 0:11:21,52
There was Tony Polito.


297
0:11:21,52 --> 0:11:23,82
There were the guys
in New Jersey.


298
0:11:23,82 --> 0:11:25,68
NICK BUBASH: Mike Malone
may have been


299
0:11:25,68 --> 0:11:27,41
tattooing at that time.


300
0:11:27,41 --> 0:11:29,64
And then everybody else was on
the outskirts, because it was


301
0:11:29,64 --> 0:11:31,3
illegal in Manhattan.


302
0:11:31,3 --> 0:11:32,44
-Thom was tattooing


303
0:11:32,44 --> 0:11:35,86
underground out of his apartment.


304
0:11:35,86 --> 0:11:37,865
I think he started off tattooing
on 8th Street and


305
0:11:37,865 --> 0:11:39,64
then eventually moved
to 4th Street.


306
0:11:39,64 --> 0:11:42,79
THOM DEVITA: When I was
underground, I worked what was


307
0:11:42,79 --> 0:11:44,49
once a kitchen.


308
0:11:44,49 --> 0:11:46,965
Took out the stove and the
refrigerator, and it's no


309
0:11:46,965 --> 0:11:48,186
longer a kitchen.


310
0:11:48,186 --> 0:11:49,99
ANGELO SCOTTO: He just worked
off a kitchen table.


311
0:11:49,99 --> 0:11:51,66
Everybody started on their
kitchen table.


312
0:11:51,66 --> 0:11:54,87
You're a bootlegger.


313
0:11:54,87 --> 0:11:56,9
THOM DEVITA: I used to have it
on one of my cards, "not for


314
0:11:56,9 --> 0:12:1,5
public display in
New York City."


315
0:12:1,5 --> 0:12:3,36
-Remember the time you were
raided, and you put everything


316
0:12:3,36 --> 0:12:4,59
in trash bags and threw them--


317
0:12:4,59 --> 0:12:6,4
THOM DEVITA: Yeah, that
was another time.


318
0:12:6,4 --> 0:12:7,65
-Threw them out the window--


319
0:12:7,65 --> 0:12:8,57
THOM DEVITA: No, no.


320
0:12:8,57 --> 0:12:9,84
I wasn't raided.


321
0:12:9,84 --> 0:12:11,36
-Or you thought you were
going to be raided.


322
0:12:11,36 --> 0:12:13,78
THOM DEVITA: I thought they
had helicopters above--


323
0:12:13,78 --> 0:12:14,7
-Yeah, they had helicopters.


324
0:12:14,7 --> 0:12:15,16
THOM DEVITA: Above my house.


325
0:12:15,16 --> 0:12:15,83
-Can't remember the story.


326
0:12:15,83 --> 0:12:19,43
THOM DEVITA: I say what,
is this for me?


327
0:12:19,43 --> 0:12:22,32
I threw them down
in the backyard.


328
0:12:22,32 --> 0:12:24,86
And they went into
the garbage can.


329
0:12:24,86 --> 0:12:26,92
So then I go out the front
door, and there's police.


330
0:12:26,92 --> 0:12:28,215
Oh, I said, my God.


331
0:12:28,215 --> 0:12:29,27
What is this?


332
0:12:29,27 --> 0:12:30,52
They were after some rapist.


333
0:12:30,52 --> 0:12:34,3



334
0:12:34,3 --> 0:12:36,17
-Thom thought they were raiding
the tattoo shop.


335
0:12:36,17 --> 0:14:36,17
