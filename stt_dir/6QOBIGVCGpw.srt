1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:7,62



2
0:0:7,62 --> 0:0:9,524
-I think his beak might
be too long.


3
0:0:9,524 --> 0:0:11,14
We should get Sonny over.


4
0:0:11,14 --> 0:0:12,6
Hey, Sonny.


5
0:0:12,6 --> 0:0:13,92
Sonny Geras.


6
0:0:13,92 --> 0:0:16,25
Have you seen any
of these guys?


7
0:0:16,25 --> 0:0:17,35
They're pretty cool.


8
0:0:17,35 --> 0:0:20,51
SONNY GERASIMONWICZ: I can't
tell if I always just wanted


9
0:0:20,51 --> 0:0:24,0
to draw, or because when you're
a kid, a lot of kids


10
0:0:24,0 --> 0:0:25,125
start drawing.


11
0:0:25,125 --> 0:0:26,54
It's one of the things you do.


12
0:0:26,54 --> 0:0:28,66
And then my dad showed me some
stuff he did in high school


13
0:0:28,66 --> 0:0:32,555
that at times blew my mind.


14
0:0:32,555 --> 0:0:35,23
It was probably the
'50s or something.


15
0:0:35,23 --> 0:0:41,9
It was flames before flames
became this disgusting thing.


16
0:0:41,9 --> 0:0:43,57
They actually were
just on hot rods.


17
0:0:43,57 --> 0:0:43,72
I don't know.


18
0:0:43,72 --> 0:0:45,86
Maybe you get a compliment or
something here and there.


19
0:0:45,86 --> 0:0:47,94
As a kid, you don't know if
someone's just encouraging you


20
0:0:47,94 --> 0:0:49,46
to keep going and doing whatever
you're doing even if


21
0:0:49,46 --> 0:0:54,1
it's bad, but you're just
totally like, yeah, yeah.


22
0:0:54,1 --> 0:0:55,5
Then graffiti started
popping up.


23
0:0:55,5 --> 0:0:56,17
Do you know what I mean?


24
0:0:56,17 --> 0:0:57,63
This is in West LA.


25
0:0:57,63 --> 0:1:0,34
It's even hard for me to
remember what I felt seeing


26
0:1:0,34 --> 0:1:5,26
it, but it was just so
attractive, seeing a person's


27
0:1:5,26 --> 0:1:6,97
name twice.


28
0:1:6,97 --> 0:1:10,91
You're like, I saw that before
on a pole, and that's exactly


29
0:1:10,91 --> 0:1:12,8
the same person.


30
0:1:12,8 --> 0:1:13,6
I haven't even met this person,
but he's been there


31
0:1:13,6 --> 0:1:14,79
and now he's been there.


32
0:1:14,79 --> 0:1:16,435
I don't who he-- you
know what I mean?


33
0:1:16,435 --> 0:1:18,46
The artwork was overwhelming.


34
0:1:18,46 --> 0:1:23,5
It was like seeing a mural, but
something was more geared


35
0:1:23,5 --> 0:1:25,77
towards you or something.


36
0:1:25,77 --> 0:1:27,9
I think it was that people did
it for no other reason but


37
0:1:27,9 --> 0:1:28,56
just to do it.


38
0:1:28,56 --> 0:1:31,2
It wasn't, we got a grant, or
we got money, or we're going


39
0:1:31,2 --> 0:1:32,39
to get this, or we're going
to advertise that.


40
0:1:32,39 --> 0:1:35,7
It's just like all it was
was just for yourself.


41
0:1:35,7 --> 0:1:37,11
It was like drawing on your
notebook or something.


42
0:1:37,11 --> 0:1:40,64
Dude, this shit's gnarly.


43
0:1:40,64 --> 0:1:47,79
This is a sketchbook, standard
graffiti-like


44
0:1:47,79 --> 0:1:48,9
piece book, I guess.


45
0:1:48,9 --> 0:1:50,49
Somebody would have someone's
book, and they borrowed it,


46
0:1:50,49 --> 0:1:52,44
and it's floating in sixth
period or whatever.


47
0:1:52,44 --> 0:1:54,85
And I was just like, let me
fucking see that book, dude.


48
0:1:54,85 --> 0:1:57,96
And the pages were so
completely done and


49
0:1:57,96 --> 0:2:1,8
air-brushed and used markers
and blending and--


50
0:2:1,8 --> 0:2:5,95
Even when it was straight-up
pen, you're just blown away.


51
0:2:5,95 --> 0:2:7,47
You're like, I want
to do that.


52
0:2:7,47 --> 0:2:9,4
OK, this is probably one of
the first books I had.


53
0:2:9,4 --> 0:2:13,47



54
0:2:13,47 --> 0:2:15,38
This is before I
even had a tag.


55
0:2:15,38 --> 0:2:17,46
It's half my name.


56
0:2:17,46 --> 0:2:21,93
Then I got in a crew,
which was AWR.


57
0:2:21,93 --> 0:2:23,89
And then--


58
0:2:23,89 --> 0:2:25,37
-What did AWR stand for?


59
0:2:25,37 --> 0:2:27,24
SONNY GERASIMONWICZ: Stood for
All Writes Reserved, but


60
0:2:27,24 --> 0:2:29,54
"writes" like graffiti
writing.


61
0:2:29,54 --> 0:2:32,77
Or Art Work Rebels.


62
0:2:32,77 --> 0:2:35,49
I think that was extremely
important because you're


63
0:2:35,49 --> 0:2:37,92
constantly doing more
artwork now.


64
0:2:37,92 --> 0:2:40,86
And you're doing color theory,
and you don't even know it.


65
0:2:40,86 --> 0:2:42,15
You're just like,
it's graffiti.


66
0:2:42,15 --> 0:2:44,67
But you don't realize all the
skill you're picking up and


67
0:2:44,67 --> 0:2:45,41
stuff like that.


68
0:2:45,41 --> 0:2:48,855
I got this photography book that
the Sex Pistols, that Bob


69
0:2:48,855 --> 0:2:51,9
Gruen-- he followed the Sex
Pistols for a long time.


70
0:2:51,9 --> 0:2:52,73
I don't know why I was so blown
away by the photos.


71
0:2:52,73 --> 0:2:53,55
They were just so good.


72
0:2:53,55 --> 0:2:56,66
And I just started copying
every single one.


73
0:2:56,66 --> 0:2:59,11
This is after graffiti, kinda.


74
0:2:59,11 --> 0:3:0,92
I was totally lost.


75
0:3:0,92 --> 0:3:1,39
I was like, oh shit.


76
0:3:1,39 --> 0:3:3,99
What do I do know?


77
0:3:3,99 --> 0:3:5,368
[INAUDIBLE]


78
0:3:5,368 --> 0:3:6,244
Pretty funny.


79
0:3:6,244 --> 0:3:7,996
Whatever.


80
0:3:7,996 --> 0:3:11,33
This was when I got
looser and better.


81
0:3:11,33 --> 0:3:16,21
It's markers, colored pencil.


82
0:3:16,21 --> 0:3:18,24
Here's what I did at Cal Arts.


83
0:3:18,24 --> 0:3:20,64
I decided to go to Cal
Arts for fine art.


84
0:3:20,64 --> 0:3:22,96
And I just wasn't into
that at all.


85
0:3:22,96 --> 0:3:24,69
I just hated it, really.


86
0:3:24,69 --> 0:3:28,21
I dropped out after two years
because they wouldn't let me


87
0:3:28,21 --> 0:3:29,56
transfer to graphic design.


88
0:3:29,56 --> 0:3:30,85
So I went and bought
a computer.


89
0:3:30,85 --> 0:3:31,72
Didn't know how to
use it at all.


90
0:3:31,72 --> 0:3:32,53
Like a Mac.


91
0:3:32,53 --> 0:3:34,74
I would lay out t-shirts.


92
0:3:34,74 --> 0:3:37,27
I'll call it graphic designer
for the sake of describing it,


93
0:3:37,27 --> 0:3:43,88
but I was not by any means a
trained graphic designer.


94
0:3:43,88 --> 0:3:47,515
This one company called Art
Machine in West L.A..


95
0:3:47,515 --> 0:3:50,68
They did key art, which is movie
posters, one sheets.


96
0:3:50,68 --> 0:3:52,58
They were building
their company.


97
0:3:52,58 --> 0:3:53,82
And they didn't have
a lot of money.


98
0:3:53,82 --> 0:3:57,1
And they were taking on
designers like, we're


99
0:3:57,1 --> 0:3:58,72
going to train you.


100
0:3:58,72 --> 0:4:0,81
And we'll pay you just not that
much at the beginning.


101
0:4:0,81 --> 0:4:3,52



102
0:4:3,52 --> 0:4:5,11
I just feel like I got lucky.


103
0:4:5,11 --> 0:4:11,925
So I learned, it's more like
Photoshop and retouching.


104
0:4:11,925 --> 0:4:13,12
You've seen movie posters.


105
0:4:13,12 --> 0:4:14,47
They're insane.


106
0:4:14,47 --> 0:4:16,17
Insanely bad most of the time.


107
0:4:16,17 --> 0:4:16,829
It's advertising.


108
0:4:16,829 --> 0:4:18,23
The goal is to make
as much money as


109
0:4:18,23 --> 0:4:19,57
possible from that film.


110
0:4:19,57 --> 0:4:22,43



111
0:4:22,43 --> 0:4:26,9
If its "Mission Impossible II",
put Tom Cruise's head as


112
0:4:26,9 --> 0:4:31,1
big as possible and a tiny-ass
missile that you can see at 50


113
0:4:31,1 --> 0:4:32,26
miles an hour driving by.


114
0:4:32,26 --> 0:4:36,26
It has nothing to do
with layout or


115
0:4:36,26 --> 0:4:37,56
a cool poster anymore.


116
0:4:37,56 --> 0:4:39,89
But if you don't give a shit
about that stuff, it's just


117
0:4:39,89 --> 0:4:41,38
like you give up.


118
0:4:41,38 --> 0:4:42,57
It's fine.


119
0:4:42,57 --> 0:4:43,4
You're like, it's a job.


120
0:4:43,4 --> 0:4:46,15
Let's do it.


121
0:4:46,15 --> 0:4:47,23
-What are some films
that you worked on?


122
0:4:47,23 --> 0:4:48,56
SONNY GERASIMONWICZ: I
knew that was coming.


123
0:4:48,56 --> 0:4:51,576
"Deuce Bigalow: European
Gigolo".


124
0:4:51,576 --> 0:4:53,11
That was one of them.


125
0:4:53,11 --> 0:4:56,54
He's sitting on a bench, and
there's a building right here.


126
0:4:56,54 --> 0:4:58,685
That one, particularly, has
a really bad head strips.


127
0:4:58,685 --> 0:5:1,39
Head strips is when you take a
head from a photo and you put


128
0:5:1,39 --> 0:5:5,81
it on another body, which
is constantly--


129
0:5:5,81 --> 0:5:6,61
They don't give a--


130
0:5:6,61 --> 0:5:9,9
They're like, he's signed
off on his head.


131
0:5:9,9 --> 0:5:9,75
We have to use it.


132
0:5:9,75 --> 0:5:11,53
So it's like this.


133
0:5:11,53 --> 0:5:19,71
When I was working at the design
advertising boutique,


134
0:5:19,71 --> 0:5:22,6
I'd gotten those emails from
Spike saying, we want to get


135
0:5:22,6 --> 0:5:24,82
some sketches of "The
Wild Things".


136
0:5:24,82 --> 0:5:27,41
I had a friend of a friend, a
friend Julian was in a band


137
0:5:27,41 --> 0:5:28,3
called Liars.


138
0:5:28,3 --> 0:5:30,39
And he toured with Karen.


139
0:5:30,39 --> 0:5:33,21
And Karen to Spike, that
was the connection.


140
0:5:33,21 --> 0:5:36,925
Spike was talking to Julian
about, he still wasn't quite


141
0:5:36,925 --> 0:5:41,43
getting the right sketches for
"The Wild Things." You know


142
0:5:41,43 --> 0:5:42,16
what I mean?


143
0:5:42,16 --> 0:5:44,56
He's like, I think, but
I don't know, but--


144
0:5:44,56 --> 0:5:47,37
Anyways, he wanted to find
somebody else to draw it.


145
0:5:47,37 --> 0:5:54,5
And then I got an email
saying, I heard--


146
0:5:54,5 --> 0:5:57,3
Julian said you might be able
to have something to offer


147
0:5:57,3 --> 0:5:58,56
with the characters.


148
0:5:58,56 --> 0:6:1,85
The first thing that I'd sent
him to get him interested,


149
0:6:1,85 --> 0:6:4,57
though, were these
pictures of--


150
0:6:4,57 --> 0:6:6,39
I'd never think I was drawing
a bear, but it would end up


151
0:6:6,39 --> 0:6:8,94
looking like a big
grizzly bear.


152
0:6:8,94 --> 0:6:12,74
And it was kind of really just
like, uhh, like [HUFF]


153
0:6:12,74 --> 0:6:15,53
I don't know, maybe like they
had hangovers or whatever.


154
0:6:15,53 --> 0:6:16,85
Had more human emotions.


155
0:6:16,85 --> 0:6:17,87
So I drew those on my own.


156
0:6:17,87 --> 0:6:21,44
And that's what I sent to Spike
to say, this is kind of


157
0:6:21,44 --> 0:6:23,15
what I'm doing right now.


158
0:6:23,15 --> 0:6:25,69
And I don't even know if I made
the connection of, these


159
0:6:25,69 --> 0:6:29,87
are big fuzzy animals, and
those are these things.


160
0:6:29,87 --> 0:6:32,9
I just sent what I want
to draw at the time.


161
0:6:32,9 --> 0:6:35,57
He saw the sketches
I sent him.


162
0:6:35,57 --> 0:6:39,9
Now he wants to just me do
that with the script.


163
0:6:39,9 --> 0:6:43,18
And they were still really
tight in the beginning.


164
0:6:43,18 --> 0:6:45,94
Some of them I was trying to
render them out and do all


165
0:6:45,94 --> 0:6:45,29
this stuff.


166
0:6:45,29 --> 0:6:47,96
And then as soon as I just
started doing really quick


167
0:6:47,96 --> 0:6:49,89
crazy ones, they came
out way better.


168
0:6:49,89 --> 0:6:52,73
One thing about Spike, too, is
you've been drawing it for 12


169
0:6:52,73 --> 0:6:55,7
hours-- one drawing-- and you've
drawn one on a napkin,


170
0:6:55,7 --> 0:6:58,18
he will judge it in exactly
the same amount of time.


171
0:6:58,18 --> 0:6:59,87
It doesn't matter how
it's rendered.


172
0:6:59,87 --> 0:7:1,19
It's the idea.


173
0:7:1,19 --> 0:7:2,1
And I was doing drawings.


174
0:7:2,1 --> 0:7:3,29
And they're like, Maurice
wants to talk


175
0:7:3,29 --> 0:7:3,87
to you on the phone.


176
0:7:3,87 --> 0:7:6,18
He wants to know who the fuck's
drawing his drawings.


177
0:7:6,18 --> 0:7:7,71
And which you're like, duh.


178
0:7:7,71 --> 0:7:8,97
And you're like,
fine, whatever.


179
0:7:8,97 --> 0:7:11,33
I have no idea, anything
about what his real


180
0:7:11,33 --> 0:7:12,15
personality is like.


181
0:7:12,15 --> 0:7:13,85
If he's, going to be like, well,
you know, I just drew


182
0:7:13,85 --> 0:7:16,99
this book as an artist, as a
child, and I just hope it


183
0:7:16,99 --> 0:7:19,28
helps children, and
dah-dah-dah-dah-dah.


184
0:7:19,28 --> 0:7:19,85
Or what.


185
0:7:19,85 --> 0:7:20,84
And he gets on the phone.


186
0:7:20,84 --> 0:7:23,77
Yeah, well, so what's
your name?


187
0:7:23,77 --> 0:7:24,91
What's your last name?


188
0:7:24,91 --> 0:7:25,367
And I'm like, Sonny.


189
0:7:25,367 --> 0:7:26,71
It's Gerasimonwicz.


190
0:7:26,71 --> 0:7:28,53
And he's like, what is that?


191
0:7:28,53 --> 0:7:30,48
He just had no idea who's
drawing his characters, if it


192
0:7:30,48 --> 0:7:33,46
was some person that draws
greeting cards, or if it was


193
0:7:33,46 --> 0:7:36,3
someone that does cartoons,
animated.


194
0:7:36,3 --> 0:7:36,67
No idea.


195
0:7:36,67 --> 0:7:38,61
I was like, I don't
draw for a living.


196
0:7:38,61 --> 0:7:41,75
I've been sort of protecting
it or something.


197
0:7:41,75 --> 0:7:44,13
I just sold out and did movie
posters for five years.


198
0:7:44,13 --> 0:7:47,1
And then we talked about some
other things, and somehow he


199
0:7:47,1 --> 0:7:48,57
just finally loosened up.


200
0:7:48,57 --> 0:7:49,41
And he was like, all right.


201
0:7:49,41 --> 0:7:50,2
Well, great.


202
0:7:50,2 --> 0:7:51,17
Let's talk about
these drawings.


203
0:7:51,17 --> 0:7:53,17
These are pretty cool.


204
0:7:53,17 --> 0:7:54,29
I like these drawings.


205
0:7:54,29 --> 0:7:56,3
This is just really great.


206
0:7:56,3 --> 0:7:58,18
I was just like, [SIGH].


207
0:7:58,18 --> 0:7:59,37
That's just the way he is.


208
0:7:59,37 --> 0:8:1,64
He's so straight up
about everything.


209
0:8:1,64 --> 0:8:3,96
And it's so valuable.


210
0:8:3,96 --> 0:8:4,515
It's amazing.


211
0:8:4,515 --> 0:8:5,7
You're just like, oh my god.


212
0:8:5,7 --> 0:8:7,44
I'm working on the
right project.


213
0:8:7,44 --> 0:8:9,21
I'm just trying to get them
close to some kind of


214
0:8:9,21 --> 0:8:10,86
live-action version
in the movie.


215
0:8:10,86 --> 0:8:11,63
Like translate it.


216
0:8:11,63 --> 0:8:15,704
I'm not trying to do his
drawings at all.


217
0:8:15,704 --> 0:8:17,6
There's one right there.


218
0:8:17,6 --> 0:8:19,99
Back when we originally went
over the script with Spike and


219
0:8:19,99 --> 0:8:22,48
he was describing what the
movie's about and how he


220
0:8:22,48 --> 0:8:25,79
wanted to do the characters,
he definitely talked more


221
0:8:25,79 --> 0:8:28,7
about how individual they were,
and where they came


222
0:8:28,7 --> 0:8:30,66
from, what their inspiration
was, and what makes them up,


223
0:8:30,66 --> 0:8:32,64
and how they relate
to each other.


224
0:8:32,64 --> 0:8:35,49
It probably took up like 90%
of the whole description of


225
0:8:35,49 --> 0:8:36,44
each character.


226
0:8:36,44 --> 0:8:38,809
It wasn't like, does Carol
have feathered pants?


227
0:8:38,809 --> 0:8:40,1
Or are they scaled pants?


228
0:8:40,1 --> 0:8:42,775
And you'd be like,
um, I don't know.


229
0:8:42,775 --> 0:8:43,36
I don't know.


230
0:8:43,36 --> 0:8:45,15
I never really--


231
0:8:45,15 --> 0:8:46,76
It's not really like
the main concern.


232
0:8:46,76 --> 0:8:48,635
After we started doing the
sketches, developing the


233
0:8:48,635 --> 0:8:52,21
characters and things like that,
I kept moving into the


234
0:8:52,21 --> 0:8:54,53
next step, which is going to the
effects houses and making


235
0:8:54,53 --> 0:8:55,86
the creatures and
stuff like that.


236
0:8:55,86 --> 0:8:58,25
My vote was with Henson, because
that's what they do is


237
0:8:58,25 --> 0:8:59,66
live-action puppets.


238
0:8:59,66 --> 0:9:3,28
If they can get one of the most
personalities out of a


239
0:9:3,28 --> 0:9:6,92
green sock with two white little
balls on top, bring


240
0:9:6,92 --> 0:9:8,74
that to these things,
we'll be good.


241
0:9:8,74 --> 0:9:10,505
-What was going on with the
suit for Alexander?


242
0:9:10,505 --> 0:9:11,78
What wasn't working?


243
0:9:11,78 --> 0:9:13,9
How that whole process
changed with you


244
0:9:13,9 --> 0:9:15,31
getting into the suit?


245
0:9:15,31 --> 0:9:16,97
SONNY GERASIMONWICZ: How I
became inside Alexander?


246
0:9:16,97 --> 0:9:19,1
-Yeah.


247
0:9:19,1 --> 0:9:22,49
SONNY GERASIMONWICZ: Well, the
actor that was inside of


248
0:9:22,49 --> 0:9:26,55
Alexander, she was really
well trained.


249
0:9:26,55 --> 0:9:30,22
Think theater actor, and
dancer-performer type.


250
0:9:30,22 --> 0:9:34,8
Catherine Keener and Peter
Elliott kept describing what


251
0:9:34,8 --> 0:9:41,0
type of character it was, and
her performance was just not


252
0:9:41,0 --> 0:9:42,45
going in that direction.


253
0:9:42,45 --> 0:9:45,65
I think Keener had already
started thinking about this.


254
0:9:45,65 --> 0:9:47,95
She would use me as an example
of the character that


255
0:9:47,95 --> 0:9:50,61
Alexander was, maybe because I
was negative or something all


256
0:9:50,61 --> 0:9:51,38
of the time.


257
0:9:51,38 --> 0:9:52,8
I don't know.


258
0:9:52,8 --> 0:9:54,8
I feel like she proposed the
idea or something when I


259
0:9:54,8 --> 0:9:54,73
wasn't around.


260
0:9:54,73 --> 0:9:56,64
And then Spike had called
me and said, how are the


261
0:9:56,64 --> 0:9:57,81
rehearsals, and things
like that.


262
0:9:57,81 --> 0:9:59,41
And I was like, ah, dude,
I don't know.


263
0:9:59,41 --> 0:10:1,4
He's like, what about
you get in the suit?


264
0:10:1,4 --> 0:10:2,17
You know, what about you?


265
0:10:2,17 --> 0:10:3,87
He was cutting a million
corners, in a


266
0:10:3,87 --> 0:10:5,44
smart way, I believe.


267
0:10:5,44 --> 0:10:7,88
I know the character already.


268
0:10:7,88 --> 0:10:9,7
I designed the character.


269
0:10:9,7 --> 0:10:11,11
I'm short.


270
0:10:11,11 --> 0:10:12,76
He knows if I would have got
in the suit, I wouldn't be


271
0:10:12,76 --> 0:10:16,81
crying and getting out of
it, like [BLUBBERING].


272
0:10:16,81 --> 0:10:18,82
I'd stick it out even
if I couldn't act.


273
0:10:18,82 --> 0:10:21,45
And I was like, I think we can
do it enough because the face


274
0:10:21,45 --> 0:10:22,31
is going to be done in post.


275
0:10:22,31 --> 0:10:24,72
And the voice is done
by Paul Dano.


276
0:10:24,72 --> 0:10:25,94
I wasn't the entire thing.


277
0:10:25,94 --> 0:10:26,995
I was this element.


278
0:10:26,995 --> 0:10:28,53
And it's like, are
you serious?


279
0:10:28,53 --> 0:10:30,13
Because then I'll answer
the question seriously.


280
0:10:30,13 --> 0:10:30,65
And he's like, yeah.


281
0:10:30,65 --> 0:10:32,28
And I was like, all right,
let's try it.


282
0:10:32,28 --> 0:10:34,6
After that, it was like him
and Keener coaching me.


283
0:10:34,6 --> 0:10:37,49
If anyone is going to make it
happen or help me do it,


284
0:10:37,49 --> 0:10:39,0
that's going to do it.


285
0:10:39,0 --> 0:10:41,2
They'd have to suit everybody
up, get them all in this


286
0:10:41,2 --> 0:10:42,97
special location in a warehouse
to do a couple


287
0:10:42,97 --> 0:10:47,12
scenes for me, two run-throughs
or something.


288
0:10:47,12 --> 0:10:48,69
That was insanely stressful.


289
0:10:48,69 --> 0:10:51,31
Because not only have you never
been on a set before


290
0:10:51,31 --> 0:10:54,95
acting, ever, but let's just
wrap him up in a suit so he


291
0:10:54,95 --> 0:10:58,15
can't see or do anything, and
tell him to run around here


292
0:10:58,15 --> 0:10:59,9
and throw this dirt
clod at that guy.


293
0:10:59,9 --> 0:11:2,1
And then when he's like, hey,
Alexander, you've got to be


294
0:11:2,1 --> 0:11:4,57
standing next to him
ready for that cue.


295
0:11:4,57 --> 0:11:8,81
And you're like, dude,
I'm fucked.


296
0:11:8,81 --> 0:11:11,32
Your opinions are welcome if
you're working on the film in


297
0:11:11,32 --> 0:11:12,37
any department.


298
0:11:12,37 --> 0:11:14,824
And, obviously, you have to
have an opinion if you're


299
0:11:14,824 --> 0:11:16,1
doing the drawings for
the creatures.


300
0:11:16,1 --> 0:11:19,0
I'd literally maybe have the
suit on and the head off and,


301
0:11:19,0 --> 0:11:20,84
Sonny, how does Carol
look in this shot?


302
0:11:20,84 --> 0:11:23,38
Or, what should we
do with this?


303
0:11:23,38 --> 0:11:25,29
All my jobs definitely
overlapped.


304
0:11:25,29 --> 0:11:27,665
Watching everybody else, the
way they approached stuff,


305
0:11:27,665 --> 0:11:32,21
like KK or Spike, the idea of
what they're doing was way up


306
0:11:32,21 --> 0:11:33,75
front more than anything else.


307
0:11:33,75 --> 0:11:36,96
It's like, OK, is that effect
going to help us tell the


308
0:11:36,96 --> 0:11:38,12
story we're trying to tell.


309
0:11:38,12 --> 0:11:40,23
It's not like, is this
the best effect we


310
0:11:40,23 --> 0:11:41,47
can get right now.


311
0:11:41,47 --> 0:11:43,83
That's probably one of the most
valuable things that I


312
0:11:43,83 --> 0:11:46,61
probably learned on it was, if
you have a good idea, believe


313
0:11:46,61 --> 0:11:47,82
in it and push it.


314
0:11:47,82 --> 0:11:49,9
Trying to figure out what
someone else wants is like the


315
0:11:49,9 --> 0:11:53,86
worst way to do it, as
far as I'm concerned.


316
0:11:53,86 --> 0:11:56,92
It comes out stiff and bad
and like, I think this


317
0:11:56,92 --> 0:11:58,17
is what they want.


318
0:11:58,17 --> 0:12:1,31



319
0:12:1,31 --> 0:12:2,56
So do your version of it.


320
0:12:2,56 --> 0:12:5,703



321
0:12:5,703 --> 0:12:7,58
All right.


322
0:12:7,58 --> 0:12:9,882
[INAUDIBLE].


323
0:12:9,882 --> 0:12:13,17
Does it look kind of like
an olive-y skin?


324
0:12:13,17 --> 0:12:16,5



325
0:12:16,5 --> 0:12:17,75
Sick.


326
0:12:17,75 --> 0:14:17,75
