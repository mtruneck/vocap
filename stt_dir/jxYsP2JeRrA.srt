0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:0,2



2
0:0:0,2 --> 0:0:1,64
UNCLE LUKE: In the Rolexx,
you go in the


3
0:0:1,64 --> 0:0:3,8
bathroom, they got condoms.


4
0:0:3,8 --> 0:0:4,75
And then you go in the
side, in the back,


5
0:0:4,75 --> 0:0:5,48
get you a lap dance.


6
0:0:5,48 --> 0:0:6,66
EDDIE HUANG: I don't
believe in condoms.


7
0:0:6,66 --> 0:0:8,94
I've been raw, raw
since day one.


8
0:0:8,94 --> 0:0:9,703
UNCLE LUKE: Oh, no, no, no.


9
0:0:9,703 --> 0:0:10,1
Safe sex.


10
0:0:10,1 --> 0:0:10,56
EDDIE HUANG: Raw
since day one.


11
0:0:10,56 --> 0:0:11,31
UNCLE LUKE: You gotta
practice safe sex.


12
0:0:11,31 --> 0:0:11,74
No, no, no.


13
0:0:11,74 --> 0:0:12,38
EDDIE HUANG: Oh, really?


14
0:0:12,38 --> 0:0:13,748
UNCLE LUKE: Don't listen
to that shit.


15
0:0:13,748 --> 0:0:15,12
[LAUGHTER]


16
0:0:15,12 --> 0:0:16,95
UNCLE LUKE: That's why
I got a new platinum


17
0:0:16,95 --> 0:0:17,7
condom coming out.


18
0:0:17,7 --> 0:0:18,22
EDDIE HUANG: All right,
we wearing condoms.


19
0:0:18,22 --> 0:0:19,4
UNCLE LUKE: Yeah, Luke Condom.


20
0:0:19,4 --> 0:0:19,64
EDDIE HUANG: I'm wearing
Luke Condoms.


21
0:0:19,64 --> 0:0:20,4
UNCLE LUKE: The platinum ones.


22
0:0:20,4 --> 0:0:21,57
EDDIE HUANG: Luke Condoms,
Luke Condoms,


23
0:0:21,57 --> 0:0:22,12
platinum Luke Condoms.


24
0:0:22,12 --> 0:0:23,82
UNCLE LUKE: Don't listen
to that shit.


25
0:0:23,82 --> 0:0:24,95
EDDIE HUANG: Uncle Luke
platinum condoms.


26
0:0:24,95 --> 0:0:25,2
Let's go.


27
0:0:25,2 --> 0:0:25,96
UNCLE LUKE: Let's go
to Rolexx, man.


28
0:0:25,96 --> 0:0:27,61
EDDIE HUANG: Let's go.


29
0:0:27,61 --> 0:0:44,71
[MUSIC PLAYING]


30
0:0:44,71 --> 0:0:47,5
EDDIE HUANG: Yo, we just landed
in Miami, and the Miami


31
0:0:47,5 --> 0:0:49,7
episode is the last episode
of "Fresh Off the


32
0:0:49,7 --> 0:0:49,96
Boat," season one.


33
0:0:49,96 --> 0:0:52,93
So savor it, enjoy it, marinate
on that shit.


34
0:0:52,93 --> 0:0:54,97
And we're going to give you
something extra heavy to chew


35
0:0:54,97 --> 0:0:56,8
on. 'Cause you're out
in Miami, there's


36
0:0:56,8 --> 0:0:58,3
one person to see.


37
0:0:58,3 --> 0:1:0,52
You don't know who that person
is, get the fuck out of town.


38
0:1:0,52 --> 0:1:2,234
Tell Uncle Luke I'm
out in Miami, too.


39
0:1:2,234 --> 0:1:10,78



40
0:1:10,78 --> 0:1:11,28
All right.


41
0:1:11,28 --> 0:1:14,13
So we at Club Lexx with one of
the soldiers watching the


42
0:1:14,13 --> 0:1:15,4
smokers here.


43
0:1:15,4 --> 0:1:16,22
Sosa, you already know.


44
0:1:16,22 --> 0:1:17,99
Show them the "Scarface" hat.


45
0:1:17,99 --> 0:1:19,942
Let me see what you're
working with, man.


46
0:1:19,942 --> 0:1:21,55
SOSA: All right, we got a--


47
0:1:21,55 --> 0:1:21,805
EDDIE HUANG: Bang.


48
0:1:21,805 --> 0:1:22,925
Oh, St. Louis ribs.


49
0:1:22,925 --> 0:1:24,15
Look at that.


50
0:1:24,15 --> 0:1:26,94
Yo, you're definitely-- he's
snapping for you right now.


51
0:1:26,94 --> 0:1:28,5
Look at this.


52
0:1:28,5 --> 0:1:30,626
Do you know what temperature
you keep this at?


53
0:1:30,626 --> 0:1:31,51
SOSA: Sugar Ray, what
temperature we


54
0:1:31,51 --> 0:1:32,62
keep this at, baby?


55
0:1:32,62 --> 0:1:34,6
SUGAR RAY: Like 350.


56
0:1:34,6 --> 0:1:34,54
EDDIE HUANG: 350?


57
0:1:34,54 --> 0:1:36,58
SUGAR RAY: Yeah, but you
don't want no fire.


58
0:1:36,58 --> 0:1:37,61
You just want the pure smoke.


59
0:1:37,61 --> 0:1:39,27
EDDIE HUANG: Yeah, yeah,
yeah, definitely.


60
0:1:39,27 --> 0:1:40,95
So they barbecuing at
a little bit of a


61
0:1:40,95 --> 0:1:42,24
higher temperature here.


62
0:1:42,24 --> 0:1:44,6
It's going to seal
in the juices.


63
0:1:44,6 --> 0:1:47,46
It probably won't fall off the
bone like you do when you have


64
0:1:47,46 --> 0:1:48,18
a lower temperature.


65
0:1:48,18 --> 0:1:49,41
That's mean.


66
0:1:49,41 --> 0:1:51,9
It's just a different
style and technique


67
0:1:51,9 --> 0:1:53,9
of doing these ribs.


68
0:1:53,9 --> 0:1:54,84
Work.


69
0:1:54,84 --> 0:1:56,85
So what's in this?


70
0:1:56,85 --> 0:2:1,85
SUGAR RAY: Well, it's a mix of
carrots, potatoes, onions,


71
0:2:1,85 --> 0:2:5,5
green peppers, Scotch
bonnet peppers.


72
0:2:5,5 --> 0:2:6,3
EDDIE HUANG: OK.


73
0:2:6,3 --> 0:2:21,506



74
0:2:21,506 --> 0:2:23,816
EDDIE HUANG: Wow.


75
0:2:23,816 --> 0:2:27,81
You know, every culture has a
stew just like this, that was


76
0:2:27,81 --> 0:2:30,1
sustenance for hundreds
and hundreds of years.


77
0:2:30,1 --> 0:2:32,75
And you could find tradition,
you could find history, you


78
0:2:32,75 --> 0:2:35,44
could find culture, you could
find sustenance anywhere--


79
0:2:35,44 --> 0:2:36,69
even outside of a strip club.


80
0:2:36,69 --> 0:2:40,59
Especially outside
of a strip club.


81
0:2:40,59 --> 0:2:42,47
Chicken souse.


82
0:2:42,47 --> 0:2:43,94
UNCLE LUKE: Yeah, yeah, yeah.


83
0:2:43,94 --> 0:2:44,526
EDDIE HUANG: What up, Luke?


84
0:2:44,526 --> 0:2:45,398
What's good?


85
0:2:45,398 --> 0:2:46,27
UNCLE LUKE: How you
feeling, man?


86
0:2:46,27 --> 0:2:47,27
EDDIE HUANG: Chilling,
chilling, man.


87
0:2:47,27 --> 0:2:48,565
Been waiting to eat
these ribs.


88
0:2:48,565 --> 0:2:49,26
This shit looks good.


89
0:2:49,26 --> 0:2:50,16
UNCLE LUKE: You hit the
right spot, man.


90
0:2:50,16 --> 0:2:50,72
EDDIE HUANG: Definitely.


91
0:2:50,72 --> 0:2:52,16
Thank you for putting
us on, Miami.


92
0:2:52,16 --> 0:2:52,93
UNCLE LUKE: Did you order?


93
0:2:52,93 --> 0:2:53,9
Let's order.


94
0:2:53,9 --> 0:2:53,66
EDDIE HUANG: No, let's order.


95
0:2:53,66 --> 0:2:55,9
I'm gonna do it the
way you do it.


96
0:2:55,9 --> 0:2:57,61
UNCLE LUKE: This is the
world-famous chef right here.


97
0:2:57,61 --> 0:3:0,56
This is where you get real
ribs, cooked to go.


98
0:3:0,56 --> 0:3:1,27
EDDIE HUANG: Yup.


99
0:3:1,27 --> 0:3:3,16
I want that "Banned
in the USA" shit.


100
0:3:3,16 --> 0:3:4,144
UNCLE LUKE: Exactly.


101
0:3:4,144 --> 0:3:5,13
Exactly.


102
0:3:5,13 --> 0:3:5,5
EDDIE HUANG: Yup.


103
0:3:5,5 --> 0:3:6,46
UNCLE LUKE: The American
way, baby.


104
0:3:6,46 --> 0:3:8,81
All right, hold on, Spike Lee,
you getting this wrist action?


105
0:3:8,81 --> 0:3:18,88



106
0:3:18,88 --> 0:3:20,85
EDDIE HUANG: So I want you
to see, when you eat this


107
0:3:20,85 --> 0:3:23,3
chicken, when you eat barbecue
chicken, you want to look for


108
0:3:23,3 --> 0:3:25,4
that red smoke color
to it, right?


109
0:3:25,4 --> 0:3:27,94
That means it's smoked properly,
when the chicken's


110
0:3:27,94 --> 0:3:29,91
got that redness to it.


111
0:3:29,91 --> 0:3:31,21
All right.


112
0:3:31,21 --> 0:3:32,23
Same with ribs.


113
0:3:32,23 --> 0:3:34,83
Ribs smoked probably will
have a red ring to it.


114
0:3:34,83 --> 0:3:36,513
SOSA: We got slabs already
seasoned, ready


115
0:3:36,513 --> 0:3:38,365
to go on the grill.


116
0:3:38,365 --> 0:3:42,7
Two hours, meat ready to go.


117
0:3:42,7 --> 0:3:43,755
EDDIE HUANG: They got
this to a science.


118
0:3:43,755 --> 0:3:45,5
That shit is good.


119
0:3:45,5 --> 0:3:48,6



120
0:3:48,6 --> 0:3:50,62
When they told us that we were
doing the Miami episode, and


121
0:3:50,62 --> 0:3:52,52
they were like, who do you
want to see on the show?


122
0:3:52,52 --> 0:3:55,4
I said, you cannot go to Miami
and not see the Mayor.


123
0:3:55,4 --> 0:3:58,24
As a kid, you always, like,
informed my life.


124
0:3:58,24 --> 0:3:59,79
Because first, you had
to the half-Chinese


125
0:3:59,79 --> 0:4:1,17
dude in 2 Live Crew.


126
0:4:1,17 --> 0:4:1,86
UNCLE LUKE: Yeah, yeah.


127
0:4:1,86 --> 0:4:3,6
EDDIE HUANG: And I fuck
with that, right?


128
0:4:3,6 --> 0:4:5,57
And then on the second level,
I fuck with Miami.


129
0:4:5,57 --> 0:4:6,71
You were the Mayor.


130
0:4:6,71 --> 0:4:7,58
And free speech.


131
0:4:7,58 --> 0:4:9,69
You know, you put everybody
on with the free speech.


132
0:4:9,69 --> 0:4:12,66
But then third, when I got
older, in law school, it came


133
0:4:12,66 --> 0:4:15,35
back to Uncle Luke again with
Acuff-Rose, 'cause he has the


134
0:4:15,35 --> 0:4:18,24
seminal case on the
parity exception.


135
0:4:18,24 --> 0:4:19,279
Lawyers owe you one.


136
0:4:19,279 --> 0:4:19,529
UNCLE LUKE: Yeah.


137
0:4:19,529 --> 0:4:19,87
Yeah, yeah.


138
0:4:19,87 --> 0:4:22,12
EDDIE HUANG: Everybody in the
music industry owe you on.


139
0:4:22,12 --> 0:4:23,56
So much respect, man.


140
0:4:23,56 --> 0:4:24,3
UNCLE LUKE: Hey, man,
appreciate it.


141
0:4:24,3 --> 0:4:24,74
Appreciate it.


142
0:4:24,74 --> 0:4:26,13
EDDIE HUANG: You a legend, So
we had to come see you.


143
0:4:26,13 --> 0:4:27,14
UNCLE LUKE: You know,
yeah, yeah.


144
0:4:27,14 --> 0:4:30,21
I appreciate you coming down.


145
0:4:30,21 --> 0:4:31,805
Hey, you see the cars,
the line of cars?


146
0:4:31,805 --> 0:4:33,62
That's for the barbecue.


147
0:4:33,62 --> 0:4:37,96
People go above and beyond to
get this barbecue here.


148
0:4:37,96 --> 0:4:39,737
-Aw, man, I come way from West
Palm Beach to do that, you


149
0:4:39,737 --> 0:4:40,88
know what I'm saying?


150
0:4:40,88 --> 0:4:42,295
Come over here and get some good
souse, some good sauce.


151
0:4:42,295 --> 0:4:44,78
-I come way from Miramar.


152
0:4:44,78 --> 0:4:48,63
-I fuck-- hey, look here,
friends go up, let's come down


153
0:4:48,63 --> 0:4:49,82
at the end of the day.


154
0:4:49,82 --> 0:4:50,55
-Oh, man.


155
0:4:50,55 --> 0:4:52,345
I don't know how much cocaine
they got in the souse, man,


156
0:4:52,345 --> 0:4:53,51
but it's something to see.


157
0:4:53,51 --> 0:4:54,79
-Top notch, man.


158
0:4:54,79 --> 0:4:56,64
I come down here all the time.


159
0:4:56,64 --> 0:4:58,17
-That's, that's what
I come here for.


160
0:4:58,17 --> 0:5:1,2
Damn them strippers, I
came for the food.


161
0:5:1,2 --> 0:5:2,816
-Best in town, man.


162
0:5:2,816 --> 0:5:3,68
-Best in town.


163
0:5:3,68 --> 0:5:5,18
-That's what's up.


164
0:5:5,18 --> 0:5:7,59
UNCLE LUKE: I mean, they making
so much money, they


165
0:5:7,59 --> 0:5:9,1
getting ready to open
up their own


166
0:5:9,1 --> 0:5:10,4
restaurant right over there.


167
0:5:10,4 --> 0:5:12,26
They building it right now.


168
0:5:12,26 --> 0:5:14,305
Yeah, no, these guys
came a long way.


169
0:5:14,305 --> 0:5:17,4
I remember when they first
opened up over here.


170
0:5:17,4 --> 0:5:18,2
EDDIE HUANG: How long ago?


171
0:5:18,2 --> 0:5:18,33
UNCLE LUKE: What is it?


172
0:5:18,33 --> 0:5:19,558
SUGAR RAY: Six and
a half years.


173
0:5:19,558 --> 0:5:20,52
UNCLE LUKE: Yep.


174
0:5:20,52 --> 0:5:22,28
EDDIE HUANG: Wow, six and a half
years, under this tent?


175
0:5:22,28 --> 0:5:23,16
UNCLE LUKE: Yep.


176
0:5:23,16 --> 0:5:25,239
EDDIE HUANG: That makes me
happy, though, 'cause a lot of


177
0:5:25,239 --> 0:5:27,89
times, the people that have
these carts and the small


178
0:5:27,89 --> 0:5:29,28
businesses, they never
get to take off.


179
0:5:29,28 --> 0:5:32,9
So that's great to
see them prosper.


180
0:5:32,9 --> 0:5:32,993
UNCLE LUKE: Freaky
Red in there?


181
0:5:32,993 --> 0:5:33,76
-Yes, sir.


182
0:5:33,76 --> 0:5:33,86
UNCLE LUKE: OK.


183
0:5:33,86 --> 0:5:34,938
Tell her her Daddy out here.


184
0:5:34,938 --> 0:5:37,8
[LAUGHTER]


185
0:5:37,8 --> 0:5:39,371
UNCLE LUKE: Why you got your
pants down and everything?


186
0:5:39,371 --> 0:5:43,107



187
0:5:43,107 --> 0:5:44,41
-Hi, Mister!


188
0:5:44,41 --> 0:5:46,26
UNCLE LUKE: So you go

189
0:5:46,26 --> 0:5:47,94

EDDIE HUANG: And the
pants is down.


191
0:5:49,736 --> 0:5:50,652
-I love him.


192

I know his--


193
0:5:52,49 --> 0:5:54,662
[LAUGHTER]


194
0:5:54,662 --> 0:5:56,466
EDDIE HUANG: Turn up.


195
0:5:56,466 --> 0:5:59,95
-Uncle Luke, I know all about
that penis over there.


196
0:5:59,95 --> 0:6:0,915
Big Daddy.


197
0:6:0,915 --> 0:6:3,34
[LAUGHTER]


198
0:6:3,34 --> 0:6:5,28
EDDIE HUANG: Shit.


199
0:6:5,28 --> 0:6:7,48
After barbecue, the other thing

200
0:6:7,48 --> 0:6:9,4

201
0:6:9,4 --> 0:6:10,17
UNCLE LUKE: Oh, yeah, yeah.


202
0:6:10,17 --> 0:6:11,62
You gotta get the conch.


203
0:6:11,62 --> 0:6:14,985
This guy here specialize

204

the place, miles around.


205
0:6:18,69 --> 0:6:21,45
He really opens up at 12
o'clock, midnight.


206
0:6:21,45 --> 0:6:22,42
EDDIE HUANG: Oh, he starts
at midnight?


207
0:6:22,42 --> 0:6:23,272
UNCLE LUKE: Yeah, midnight.


208
0:6:23,272 --> 0:6:23,7
Yeah.


209
0:6:23,7 --> 0:6:24,54
EDDIE HUANG: Wow.


210
0:6:24,54 --> 0:6:26,98
So it really is that
aphrodisiac food.


211
0:6:26,98 --> 0:6:27,71
UNCLE LUKE: Exactly.


212
0:6:27,71 --> 0:6:29,74
Conch Daddy!


213
0:6:29,74 --> 0:6:31,75
You do a lot of chopping
tonight, Conch Daddy.


214
0:6:31,75 --> 0:6:35,7



215
0:6:35,7 --> 0:6:36,55
EDDIE HUANG: Conch
Daddy, thank you.


216
0:6:36,55 --> 0:6:37,98
UNCLE LUKE: Hey.


217
0:6:37,98 --> 0:6:39,19
Oh, baby.


218
0:6:39,19 --> 0:6:43,25
And then when you finish this,
you can go get any woman,


219
0:6:43,25 --> 0:6:45,53
aphrodisiac, lay up all night.


220
0:6:45,53 --> 0:6:46,35
EDDIE HUANG: Look
at this conch.


221
0:6:46,35 --> 0:6:47,85
I'm-a bite into it
so you can see.


222
0:6:47,85 --> 0:6:49,73
Usually conch is rubbery
like octopus.


223
0:6:49,73 --> 0:6:50,57
UNCLE LUKE: That's right.


224
0:6:50,57 --> 0:6:51,71
That's the key.


225
0:6:51,71 --> 0:6:52,68
EDDIE HUANG: It just
goes like that.


226
0:6:52,68 --> 0:6:54,895
You hear that snap?


227
0:6:54,895 --> 0:6:56,34
UNCLE LUKE: That's when
you know it's fresh.


228
0:6:56,34 --> 0:6:57,526
EDDIE HUANG: Crazy.


229
0:6:57,526 --> 0:6:59,7
I mean, I knew you would know
what was up, but this is


230
0:6:59,7 --> 0:7:1,75
beyond expectation.


231
0:7:1,75 --> 0:7:3,82
UNCLE LUKE: Hey, I'm a food--


232
0:7:3,82 --> 0:7:7,25
being that I'm a former
chef, I always gotta


233
0:7:7,25 --> 0:7:9,6
find the good food.


234
0:7:9,6 --> 0:7:11,195
EDDIE HUANG: You were telling
me, you were a chef before you


235
0:7:11,195 --> 0:7:11,54
were a rapper.


236
0:7:11,54 --> 0:7:12,602
UNCLE LUKE: Yeah.


237
0:7:12,602 --> 0:7:15,77
While I was cooking, my
night job was DJing.


238
0:7:15,77 --> 0:7:16,17
EDDIE HUANG: OK.


239
0:7:16,17 --> 0:7:19,2
UNCLE LUKE: So I DJed, and
then I started bringing


240
0:7:19,2 --> 0:7:20,48
concerts down.


241
0:7:20,48 --> 0:7:22,26
So I started making
more money.


242
0:7:22,26 --> 0:7:24,4
Then, I mean, the money--


243
0:7:24,4 --> 0:7:27,7
going to work at a day job
didn't mean nothing, so


244
0:7:27,7 --> 0:7:29,14
eventually I just stopped
doing that.


245
0:7:29,14 --> 0:7:30,43
EDDIE HUANG: That's the thing
though, for a lot of artists,


246
0:7:30,43 --> 0:7:32,96
a lot of entrepreneurs, when
they're trying to get their


247
0:7:32,96 --> 0:7:34,74
shit poppin', you work
in a restaurant.


248
0:7:34,74 --> 0:7:35,34
UNCLE LUKE: You work
in a restaurant.


249
0:7:35,34 --> 0:7:36,65
EDDIE HUANG: Easiest thing
to do is work shifts in a


250
0:7:36,65 --> 0:7:38,38
restaurant.


251
0:7:38,38 --> 0:7:39,74
What's that, fried snow crab?


252
0:7:39,74 --> 0:7:40,57
I gotta taste one.


253
0:7:40,57 --> 0:7:42,125
I gotta try one of them.


254
0:7:42,125 --> 0:7:45,17
UNCLE LUKE: I hope this ain't
y'all first day shooting,


255
0:7:45,17 --> 0:7:47,13
'cause y'all gonna be fucked up
for the rest of the week.


256
0:7:47,13 --> 0:7:48,84
You'll be running over here.


257
0:7:48,84 --> 0:7:49,73
No, this guy--


258
0:7:49,73 --> 0:7:50,47
EDDIE HUANG: This is crazy.


259
0:7:50,47 --> 0:7:53,38
UNCLE LUKE: Conch Daddy
is the best.


260
0:7:53,38 --> 0:7:56,2
-122nd and 27th Avenue.


261
0:7:56,2 --> 0:7:59,466
And we also got National Tires,
my main man, too.


262
0:7:59,466 --> 0:8:1,17
EDDIE HUANG: You know what's
funny, is when people tell


263
0:8:1,17 --> 0:8:3,16
chefs, oh, you a chef, just
do the chef thing.


264
0:8:3,16 --> 0:8:5,9
You got this, you got
the tire shop.


265
0:8:5,9 --> 0:8:6,51
I do everything.


266
0:8:6,51 --> 0:8:9,25
You've got to get paper
every which way.


267
0:8:9,25 --> 0:8:9,57
UNCLE LUKE: Fucking producer.


268
0:8:9,57 --> 0:8:11,34
[LAUGHTER]


269
0:8:11,34 --> 0:8:12,83
UNCLE LUKE: I done took you
out to the mountain-top.


270
0:8:12,83 --> 0:8:16,35
You're always supposed
to get me last.


271
0:8:16,35 --> 0:8:16,59
EDDIE HUANG: Yeah.


272
0:8:16,59 --> 0:8:18,58
UNCLE LUKE: You supposed
to get the king last.


273
0:8:18,58 --> 0:8:20,37
EDDIE HUANG: No, but we needed
a key to the city.


274
0:8:20,37 --> 0:8:22,63
UNCLE LUKE: Hey, man, only
way I could give you


275
0:8:22,63 --> 0:8:23,375
the key to the city?


276
0:8:23,375 --> 0:8:23,78
EDDIE HUANG: Yeah?


277
0:8:23,78 --> 0:8:25,63
UNCLE LUKE: I do it at my
man Conch Daddy's place.


278
0:8:25,63 --> 0:8:27,9
And here it is.


279
0:8:27,9 --> 0:8:29,65
You got the stone crab key
to the city, baby.


280
0:8:29,65 --> 0:8:30,38
EDDIE HUANG: There we go.


281
0:8:30,38 --> 0:8:30,97
UNCLE LUKE: There it is.


282
0:8:30,97 --> 0:8:34,309
Fried live, laid to the side,
get your body right.


283
0:8:34,309 --> 0:8:35,2
EDDIE HUANG: Thank you.


284
0:8:35,2 --> 0:8:35,98
Thank you, Luke.


285
0:8:35,98 --> 0:8:36,76
Let's get up in the Rolexx.


286
0:8:36,76 --> 0:8:37,299
UNCLE LUKE: Let's go.


287
0:8:37,299 --> 0:8:39,74
Let me take you on in, make sure
the girls take care of


288
0:8:39,74 --> 0:8:40,44
you real nice.


289
0:8:40,44 --> 0:8:41,372
EDDIE HUANG: Yup.


290
0:8:41,372 --> 0:8:42,46
I appreciate it.


291
0:8:42,46 --> 0:8:43,929
UNCLE LUKE: Don't have no
sex with nobody in here.


292
0:8:43,929 --> 0:8:44,37
EDDIE HUANG: No?


293
0:8:44,37 --> 0:8:45,38
No sex in the champagne room.


294
0:8:45,38 --> 0:8:46,4
UNCLE LUKE: With this
raw dog stuff.


295
0:8:46,4 --> 0:8:47,39
EDDIE HUANG: No raw dog.


296
0:8:47,39 --> 0:8:49,23
Only with the Uncle
Luke condom.


297
0:8:49,23 --> 0:8:50,1
UNCLE LUKE: Yeah.


298
0:8:50,1 --> 0:8:51,28
The platinum one.


299
0:8:51,28 --> 0:8:52,45
EDDIE HUANG: OK.


300
0:8:52,45 --> 0:8:55,43
On the next episode of "Fresh
Off the Boat"--


301
0:8:55,43 --> 0:9:0,23
-This boat symbolizes, really,
you know, you're out there,


302
0:9:0,23 --> 0:9:2,92
you're trying to make
a living, you know--


303
0:9:2,92 --> 0:9:5,4
this shows you real life.


304
0:9:5,4 --> 0:9:6,17
This is real life, here.


305
0:9:6,17 --> 0:9:8,93
And then, of course, it also
symbolizes a journey.


306
0:9:8,93 --> 0:9:10,18
We came over here.


307
0:9:10,18 --> 0:9:12,33
But at the end of the
day, this is how


308
0:9:12,33 --> 0:9:13,53
things are being done.


309
0:9:13,53 --> 0:9:15,3
-Good job, Chef!


310
0:9:15,3 --> 0:9:16,28
That's delicious, man.


311
0:9:16,28 --> 0:11:16,28
