1
0:0:15,167 --> 0:0:18,333
Okay, guys, here we go.
Here we go.


2
0:0:18,333 --> 0:0:20,417
One, two-


3
0:0:20,417 --> 0:0:26,167
One, two, three-


4
0:0:26,167 --> 0:0:29,167
! It's been one week
since you looked at me!


5
0:0:29,167 --> 0:0:31,292
! Cocked your head to the side
and said I'm angry!


6
0:0:31,292 --> 0:0:33,292
! Five days since you
Laughed at me saying!


7
0:0:33,292 --> 0:0:35,542
! Get that together
come back and see me!


8
0:0:35,542 --> 0:0:37,542
! Three days since
the living room!


9
0:0:37,542 --> 0:0:39,708
! I realised it's all my fault
but couldn't tell you!


10
0:0:39,708 --> 0:0:41,667
! Yesterday you'd forgiven me!


11
0:0:41,667 --> 0:0:44,42
! But it'll still be two days
till I say I'm sorry!


12
0:0:44,42 --> 0:0:46,625
! Hold it now and watch the hoodwink
as I make you stop, think!


13
0:0:46,625 --> 0:0:49,333
! You'll think you're looking at Aquaman
I summon fish to the dish!


14
0:0:49,333 --> 0:0:52,5
! Though I like my Chalet Swiss
I like the sushi 'cause it's
never touched a frying pan!


15
0:0:52,5 --> 0:0:55,292
! Hot Like wasabi when I bust rhymes
Big Like Leann Rimes!


16
0:0:55,292 --> 0:0:58,375
! Because I'm all about value
Bert Kaempfert's got the mad hits!


17
0:0:58,375 --> 0:1:1,0
! You try to match wits
You try to hold me but I bust through!


18
0:1:1,0 --> 0:1:3,125
! Gonna make a break and take a fake
I'd like a stinkin' achin' shake!


19
0:1:3,125 --> 0:1:5,333
! I like vanilla
It's the finest of the flavours!


20
0:1:5,333 --> 0:1:7,375
! Gotta see the show 'cause then you'll
know the vertigo is gonna grow!


21
0:1:7,375 --> 0:1:13,458
! 'Cause it's so dangerous
you'll have to sign a waiver!


22
0:1:13,458 --> 0:1:17,667
! I don't give a damn
'bout my reputation!


23
0:1:17,667 --> 0:1:22,792
! You're living' in the past
It's a new generation!


24
0:1:22,792 --> 0:1:26,917
! A girl can do what she wants to do
and that's what I'm gonna do!


25
0:1:26,917 --> 0:1:32,42
! And I don't give a damn
'bout my bad reputation!


26
0:1:32,42 --> 0:1:34,292
-! Oh, no!
-! No, no, no, no, no, no!


27
0:1:34,292 --> 0:1:36,958
-! Not me!
-! Me, me, me, me, me, me!


28
0:1:36,958 --> 0:1:41,625
! And I don't give a damn
'bout my reputation!


29
0:1:41,625 --> 0:1:45,375
! Never said I wanted
to improve my station!


30
0:1:45,375 --> 0:1:48,5
! And I'm only doing good
when I'm having fun!


31
0:1:48,5 --> 0:1:51,42
! And I don't have
to please no one!


32
0:1:51,42 --> 0:1:54,833
-! And I don't give a damn
'bout my bad reputation!
- Hey!


33
0:1:54,833 --> 0:1:57,708
-! Oh, no!
-! No, no, no, no, no, no!


34
0:1:57,708 --> 0:2:0,208
-! Not me!


35
0:2:0,208 --> 0:2:14,208
I'll be right with you.


36
0:2:14,208 --> 0:2:18,333
So, Cameron.
Here you go.


37
0:2:18,333 --> 0:2:22,0
Nine schools in ten years.
My, my. Army brat?


38
0:2:22,0 --> 0:2:26,375
- Yeah. M-My dad is, uh-
- That's enough.


39
0:2:26,375 --> 0:2:29,75
I'm sure you won't find Padua
any different than your old schools.


40
0:2:29,75 --> 0:2:33,958
Same little ass-wipe shit-for-brains
everywhere.


41
0:2:33,958 --> 0:2:39,875
Excuse me? Did you just say-
Am I in the right office?


42
0:2:39,875 --> 0:2:42,75
Not any more, you're not. I've got
deviants to see and a novel to finish.


43
0:2:42,75 --> 0:2:44,958
Now, scoot. Scoot!


44
0:2:44,958 --> 0:2:47,5
Okay.


45
0:2:47,5 --> 0:2:53,25
Thanks. Thanks a lot.


46
0:2:53,25 --> 0:2:55,375
Patrick Verona.


47
0:2:55,375 --> 0:2:58,83
I see we're making
our visits a weekly ritual.


48
0:2:58,83 --> 0:3:1,458
Only so we can have these moments
together. Should I, uh, hit the lights?


49
0:3:1,458 --> 0:3:4,333
Oh, very clever,
kangaroo boy.


50
0:3:4,333 --> 0:3:7,83
Says here you exposed yourself
in the cafeteria?


51
0:3:7,83 --> 0:3:10,0
I was joking with the lunch lady.
It was a bratwurst.


52
0:3:10,0 --> 0:3:13,167
Bratwurst?


53
0:3:13,167 --> 0:3:17,917
Aren't we the optimist?


54
0:3:17,917 --> 0:3:21,667
Next time, keep it
in your pouch, okay?


55
0:3:21,667 --> 0:3:37,83
Scoot!


56
0:3:37,83 --> 0:3:39,667
Hello! Michael Eckman.
I'm supposed to show you around.


57
0:3:39,667 --> 0:3:42,0
Oh, hi. Thank God.
You know, uh-


58
0:3:42,0 --> 0:3:45,75
- Normally they send down
one of those audiovisual geeks.
- No, I do.


59
0:3:45,75 --> 0:3:48,25
- I know what you mean.
- Hey, Michael, where should I
put those slides?


60
0:3:48,25 --> 0:3:52,708
Michael?
So, uh- Cameron.


61
0:3:52,708 --> 0:3:56,875
Here's the breakdown. Over there,
we've got your basic beautiful people.


62
0:3:56,875 --> 0:4:0,375
Now listen. Unless they talk
to you first, don't bother.


63
0:4:0,375 --> 0:4:3,417
- Wait. Is that your rule or theirs?
- Watch. Hey, there.


64
0:4:3,417 --> 0:4:7,708
- Eat me.
- You see that?


65
0:4:7,708 --> 0:4:9,708
- To the left, we have the coffee kids.


66
0:4:9,708 --> 0:4:12,208
- That was Costa Rican, butthead!
- Very edgy.


67
0:4:12,208 --> 0:4:14,208
Don't make any sudden
movements around them.


68
0:4:14,208 --> 0:4:16,792
These delusionals
are your white Rastas.


69
0:4:16,792 --> 0:4:19,333
They're big Marley fans.
They think they're black.


70
0:4:19,333 --> 0:4:21,625
- Semi-political, but mostly-
- Smoke a lot of weed?


71
0:4:21,625 --> 0:4:24,708
- Yeah. These guys-
- Wait, wait. Let me guess. Cowboys?


72
0:4:24,708 --> 0:4:27,875
Yeah, but the closest they've come
to a cow is McDonald's.


73
0:4:27,875 --> 0:4:31,375
McDonald's.


74
0:4:31,375 --> 0:4:34,917
These are your future MBAs.
We're all Ivy League accepted.


75
0:4:34,917 --> 0:4:36,917
Yuppie greed is back,
my friend.


76
0:4:36,917 --> 0:4:41,83
- Hey, guys, how you doin'?
- Close it, Bogey!


77
0:4:41,83 --> 0:4:44,125
- Yesterday, I was their god.
- What happened?


78
0:4:44,125 --> 0:4:47,833
Bogey Lowenstein
started a rumor that I-


79
0:4:47,833 --> 0:4:51,25
that I buy my Izods
at an outlet mall.


80
0:4:51,25 --> 0:4:54,208
- So they kicked you out?
- Hostile takeover. But don't worry.


81
0:4:54,208 --> 0:5:5,417
- He'll pay. Now, over here-
- Oh, my God.


82
0:5:5,417 --> 0:5:8,708
- What group is she in?
- The "don't even think about it" group.


83
0:5:8,708 --> 0:5:12,833
- That's Bianca Stratford.
She's a sophomore.
- I burn, I pine, I perish.


84
0:5:12,833 --> 0:5:16,292
Of course you do.
You know, she's beautiful and deep.


85
0:5:16,292 --> 0:5:18,292
I'm sure.


86
0:5:18,292 --> 0:5:20,958
Yeah, but see, there's a difference
between like and love.


87
0:5:20,958 --> 0:5:24,833
Because I like my Skechers,
but I love my Prada backpack.


88
0:5:24,833 --> 0:5:27,125
But I love my Skechers.


89
0:5:27,125 --> 0:5:32,83
- That's because
you don't have a Prada backpack.
- Oh.


90
0:5:32,83 --> 0:5:35,125
Listen, forget her.
Incredibly uptight father.


91
0:5:35,125 --> 0:5:38,625
And it's a widely known fact
that the Stratford sisters
aren't allowed to date.


92
0:5:38,625 --> 0:5:41,25
Uh-huh. Yeah.


93
0:5:41,25 --> 0:5:49,792
- Whatever.


94
0:5:49,792 --> 0:5:53,625
Okay, then. What did everyone
think of The Sun Also Rises?


95
0:5:53,625 --> 0:5:57,208
I loved it.
He's so romantic.


96
0:5:57,208 --> 0:5:59,5
Romantic?
Hemingway?


97
0:5:59,5 --> 0:6:2,5
He was an abusive, alcoholic misogynist
who squandered half his life...


98
0:6:2,5 --> 0:6:5,42
hanging around Picasso
trying to nail his leftovers.


99
0:6:5,42 --> 0:6:10,917
As opposed to a bitter,
self-righteous hag who has no friends?


100
0:6:10,917 --> 0:6:13,708
Pipe down, Chachi.


101
0:6:13,708 --> 0:6:17,875
I guess in this society, being male and
an asshole makes you worthy of our time.


102
0:6:17,875 --> 0:6:20,708
- What about Sylvia Plath...


103
0:6:20,708 --> 0:6:23,458
or Charlotte Bronte
or Simone de Beauvoir?


104
0:6:23,458 --> 0:6:25,833
What'd I miss?


105
0:6:25,833 --> 0:6:29,667
The oppressive patriarchal values
that dictate our education.


106
0:6:29,667 --> 0:6:32,375
Good.


107
0:6:32,375 --> 0:6:34,375
- Hey, hey!
- Mr Morgan.


108
0:6:34,375 --> 0:6:40,792
Is there any chance
we could get Kat to take her Midol
before she comes to class?


109
0:6:40,792 --> 0:6:45,333
Someday you're gonna get bitch-slapped,
and I'm not gonna do a thing to stop it.


110
0:6:45,333 --> 0:6:47,708
And Kat, I want to thank you
for your point of view.


111
0:6:47,708 --> 0:6:50,542
I know how difficult it must be for you
to overcome all those years...


112
0:6:50,542 --> 0:6:53,375
of upper-middle class
suburban oppression.


113
0:6:53,375 --> 0:6:55,542
Must be tough.


114
0:6:55,542 --> 0:6:59,333
But the next time you storm the P.T.A.,
crusading for better lunch meat...


115
0:6:59,333 --> 0:7:1,25
or whatever it is
you white girls complain about,


116
0:7:1,25 --> 0:7:4,42
ask them why they can't buy a book
written by a black man!


117
0:7:4,42 --> 0:7:9,917
- That's right, mon!
- Don't even get me started on you two.


118
0:7:9,917 --> 0:7:13,667
- Anything else?
- Yeah, go to the office.
You're pissing me off.


119
0:7:13,667 --> 0:7:18,417
- What? Mr Morgan-
- Later!


120
0:7:18,417 --> 0:7:22,25
- Wha-


121
0:7:22,25 --> 0:7:25,75
Undulating with desire,


122
0:7:25,75 --> 0:7:39,958
Adrienne removes her red-


123
0:7:39,958 --> 0:7:42,292
crimson cape...


124
0:7:42,292 --> 0:7:49,25
at the sight of
Reginald's stiff and-


125
0:7:49,25 --> 0:7:52,708
Judith!


126
0:7:52,708 --> 0:7:56,292
What's another word
for "engorged"?


127
0:7:56,292 --> 0:7:58,583
I'll look it up.


128
0:7:58,583 --> 0:8:1,292
Okay.


129
0:8:1,292 --> 0:8:5,667
- Swollen. Turgid.
- Tumescent?


130
0:8:5,667 --> 0:8:8,5
Perfect.


131
0:8:8,5 --> 0:8:14,417
So, I hear you were terrorizing
Mr Morgan's class again.


132
0:8:14,417 --> 0:8:16,5
Expressing my opinion
is not a terrorist action.


133
0:8:16,5 --> 0:8:20,417
The way you expressed your opinion
to Bobby Ridgeway?


134
0:8:20,417 --> 0:8:23,125
By the way, his testicle
retrieval operation went quite well,


135
0:8:23,125 --> 0:8:24,792
in case you're interested.


136
0:8:24,792 --> 0:8:27,833
I still maintain that he
kicked himself in the balls.


137
0:8:27,833 --> 0:8:32,875
The point is, Kat-


138
0:8:32,875 --> 0:8:40,208
- Cat.


139
0:8:40,208 --> 0:8:42,292
People perceive you as somewhat-


140
0:8:42,292 --> 0:8:48,833
- Tempestuous?
- "Heinous bitch"
is the term used most often.


141
0:8:48,833 --> 0:8:52,458
You might want to work on that.


142
0:8:52,458 --> 0:8:54,625
Thank you.


143
0:8:54,625 --> 0:8:58,917
As always, thank you
for your excellent guidance.


144
0:8:58,917 --> 0:9:3,417
I'll let you get back
to Reginald's quivering member.


145
0:9:3,417 --> 0:9:7,125
"Quivering member."
I like that.


146
0:9:7,125 --> 0:9:15,583
Virgin alert.
Your favorite.


147
0:9:15,583 --> 0:9:18,417
Ooh.
Lookin' good, ladies.


148
0:9:18,417 --> 0:9:21,167
Oh, she's out of reach, even for you.


149
0:9:21,167 --> 0:9:25,167
- No one's out of reach for me.
- You wanna put money on that?


150
0:9:25,167 --> 0:9:27,333
Money, I've got.


151
0:9:27,333 --> 0:9:32,875
- This I'm gonna do for fun.


152
0:9:32,875 --> 0:9:35,83
- Who's that guy?
- That's Joey Donner.


153
0:9:35,83 --> 0:9:37,667
He's a jerk off, and a model.


154
0:9:37,667 --> 0:9:39,667
- He's a model?
- A model.


155
0:9:39,667 --> 0:9:42,708
Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored
to have a big tube sock ad coming out.


156
0:9:42,708 --> 0:9:49,417
- Really?
- Really.


157
0:9:49,417 --> 0:9:52,458
Man, look at her.
Is she always so-


158
0:9:52,458 --> 0:9:55,417
- Vapid?
- How can you say that? She's totally-


159
0:9:55,417 --> 0:9:57,417
- Conceited.
- What are you talking about?


160
0:9:57,417 --> 0:9:59,833
There's more to her than you think.


161
0:9:59,833 --> 0:10:4,5
Look at the way s-she smiles,
and-and look at her eyes, man.


162
0:10:4,5 --> 0:10:7,917
She's totally pure.
You're missing what's there.


163
0:10:7,917 --> 0:10:10,75
No, no, Cameron, no.
What's there...


164
0:10:10,75 --> 0:10:15,125
is a snotty little princess wearing
a strategically planned sundress...


165
0:10:15,125 --> 0:10:18,458
to make guys like us realize
that we can never touch her...


166
0:10:18,458 --> 0:10:21,5
and guys like Joey realize
that they want to.


167
0:10:21,5 --> 0:10:25,83
She, my friend, is what we will spend
the rest of our lives not having.


168
0:10:25,83 --> 0:10:27,25
Put her in your spank bank,
move on.


169
0:10:27,25 --> 0:10:30,333
- Move on.
- No, no. You're wrong about her.


170
0:10:30,333 --> 0:10:34,0
I mean, you know, not about the spanking
part, but the rest, you're wrong.


171
0:10:34,0 --> 0:10:37,583
All right- I'm wrong?
You wanna take a shot, be my guest.


172
0:10:37,583 --> 0:10:39,625
She's actually looking
for a French tutor.


173
0:10:39,625 --> 0:10:41,708
Are you serious?
That's perfect!


174
0:10:41,708 --> 0:10:43,917
D-Do you speak French?


175
0:10:43,917 --> 0:10:49,208
Well, no, but I will.


176
0:10:49,208 --> 0:10:52,875
Hey. Your little Rambo look
is out, Kat.


177
0:10:52,875 --> 0:10:59,792
- Didn't you read last month's Cosmo?
- Run along.


178
0:10:59,792 --> 0:11:3,83
I know you can be overwhelmed,
and you can be under whelmed,


179
0:11:3,83 --> 0:11:5,625
but can you ever
just be "whelmed"?


180
0:11:5,625 --> 0:11:9,625
- I think you can in Europe.
- Hi, ladies.


181
0:11:9,625 --> 0:11:17,167
Would you sweet young things
like a ride?


182
0:11:17,167 --> 0:11:21,417
Careful on the leather.


183
0:11:21,417 --> 0:11:23,417
Whoo!


184
0:11:23,417 --> 0:11:26,208
That's a charming
new development.


185
0:11:26,208 --> 0:11:31,208
It's disgusting.


186
0:11:31,208 --> 0:11:39,42
Remove head from sphincter,
then drive!


187
0:11:39,42 --> 0:11:44,333
- You okay?
- Yeah. Just a minor encounter
with the shrew.


188
0:11:44,333 --> 0:11:47,917
- That's your girlfriend's sister.
- That's Bianca's sister?


189
0:11:47,917 --> 0:11:51,583
The mewling, rampalian wretch herself.


190
0:11:51,583 --> 0:11:55,583
- Stay cool, bro.
- Yeah, see you later.


191
0:11:55,583 --> 0:12:2,75
Look out!


192
0:12:2,75 --> 0:12:21,25
My balls!
Oh, boy.


193
0:12:21,25 --> 0:12:43,375
Yeah, whoo!


194
0:12:43,375 --> 0:12:48,42
! Sunshine on the window!


195
0:12:48,42 --> 0:12:50,75
! Makes me happy!


196
0:12:50,75 --> 0:12:53,833
! Like I should be!


197
0:12:53,833 --> 0:12:58,5
! Outside all around me!


198
0:12:58,5 --> 0:13:1,0
! Really sleazy!


199
0:13:1,0 --> 0:13:3,917
! Then it hits me!


200
0:13:3,917 --> 0:13:5,958
! Don't tell me!


201
0:13:5,958 --> 0:13:8,958
! You can't see
what it means to me!


202
0:13:8,958 --> 0:13:13,25
! Me, me, me!


203
0:13:13,25 --> 0:13:16,417
Hello, Katarina.
Make anyone cry today?


204
0:13:16,417 --> 0:13:20,583
Sadly, no.
But it's only 4:30.


205
0:13:20,583 --> 0:13:22,75
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hello, precious.


206
0:13:22,75 --> 0:13:25,708
- And where have you been?
- Nowhere.


207
0:13:25,708 --> 0:13:32,167
Hey, what's this?
It says Sarah Lawrence.


208
0:13:32,167 --> 0:13:34,542
I got in!


209
0:13:34,542 --> 0:13:36,583
I got in!


210
0:13:36,583 --> 0:13:38,875
Uh, honey,
that's great,


211
0:13:38,875 --> 0:13:41,125
but isn't Sarah Lawrence
on the other side of the country?


212
0:13:41,125 --> 0:13:43,458
- Thus the basis of its appeal.


213
0:13:43,458 --> 0:13:45,792
I thought you decided you were
going to stay here and go to school.


214
0:13:45,792 --> 0:13:50,167
"U Dub," like me.
Be a Husky.


215
0:13:50,167 --> 0:13:52,458
No, you decided.


216
0:13:52,458 --> 0:13:55,25
Oh, okay, so what, you just pick up
and leave, is that it?


217
0:13:55,25 --> 0:13:56,792
Let's hope so.


218
0:13:56,792 --> 0:13:59,167
Ask Bianca who drove her home.


219
0:13:59,167 --> 0:14:1,625
Kat, don't change the-
Drove? Who drove you home?


220
0:14:1,625 --> 0:14:4,292
Now, don't get upset, Daddy,
but there's this boy-


221
0:14:4,292 --> 0:14:7,125
- Who's a flaming imbecile.
- And I think he might ask me-


222
0:14:7,125 --> 0:14:9,167
Please. I think I know
what he's going to ask you.


223
0:14:9,167 --> 0:14:12,83
And I think I know the answer- no.
It's always no.


224
0:14:12,83 --> 0:14:16,25
What are the two house rules?
Number one: no dating till you graduate.


225
0:14:16,25 --> 0:14:19,167
Number two:
no dating till you graduate.


226
0:14:19,167 --> 0:14:22,167
- That's it.
- Daddy, that's so unfair.


227
0:14:22,167 --> 0:14:25,167
All right, you want to know
what's unfair? This is for you too.


228
0:14:25,167 --> 0:14:28,458
This morning I delivered a set of twins
to a 15-year-old girl.


229
0:14:28,458 --> 0:14:30,792
Do you know what
she said to me?


230
0:14:30,792 --> 0:14:36,458
I'm a crack whore who should have
made my skeezy boyfriend wear a condom?


231
0:14:36,458 --> 0:14:38,708
Close, but no.


232
0:14:38,708 --> 0:14:42,83
She said,
"I should have listened to my father."


233
0:14:42,83 --> 0:14:44,667
- She did not.
- Well, that's what
she would have said...


234
0:14:44,667 --> 0:14:46,708
if she wasn't so doped up.


235
0:14:46,708 --> 0:14:50,0
Can we focus on me
for a second, please?


236
0:14:50,0 --> 0:14:52,167
I am the only girl in school
who's not dating.


237
0:14:52,167 --> 0:14:55,0
- Oh, no you're not.
Your sister doesn't date.
- And I don't intend to.


238
0:14:55,0 --> 0:14:59,875
- And why is that again?
- Have you seen the unwashed miscreants
that go to that school?


239
0:14:59,875 --> 0:15:2,542
Where did you come from?
Planet Loser?


240
0:15:2,542 --> 0:15:5,375
- As opposed to
Planet Look At Me, Look At Me.


241
0:15:5,375 --> 0:15:8,42
Okay, here's how we solve this one.


242
0:15:8,42 --> 0:15:13,875
Old rule out.
New rule: Bianca can date...


243
0:15:13,875 --> 0:15:17,458
when she does.


244
0:15:17,458 --> 0:15:20,125
But she's a mutant!
What if she never dates?


245
0:15:20,125 --> 0:15:22,542
Then you'll never date.
Oh, I like that.


246
0:15:22,542 --> 0:15:24,958
And I'll get to
sleep at night.


247
0:15:24,958 --> 0:15:30,708
The deep slumber of a father whose
daughters aren't out being impregnated.


248
0:15:30,708 --> 0:15:32,958
- We'll talk about Sarah Lawrence later.
- Fine.


249
0:15:32,958 --> 0:15:36,667
- Wait! Daddy!
- Gotta go.


250
0:15:36,667 --> 0:15:38,833
Can't you just find
some blind, deaf retard...


251
0:15:38,833 --> 0:15:41,208
to take you to the movies
so I can have one date?


252
0:15:41,208 --> 0:15:43,167
I'm sorry. Looks like you'll
just have to miss out...


253
0:15:43,167 --> 0:15:45,958
on the witty repartee
of Joey "Eat Me" Donner.


254
0:15:45,958 --> 0:15:48,83
You suck.


255
0:15:48,83 --> 0:16:2,875
You suck.


256
0:16:2,875 --> 0:16:4,875
Hi.
Can we make this quick?


257
0:16:4,875 --> 0:16:7,125
Roxanne Corinne and Andrew Jarrett
are having an incredibly horrendous...


258
0:16:7,125 --> 0:16:10,583
public break-up on the quad...
again.


259
0:16:10,583 --> 0:16:13,583
Oh, yeah, um, okay.
I thought that we'd, um,


260
0:16:13,583 --> 0:16:16,833
start with pronunciation,
if that's all right with you.


261
0:16:16,833 --> 0:16:19,5
Not the hacking and gagging
and spitting part, please.


262
0:16:19,5 --> 0:16:22,833
Well, uh, there is
an alternative.


263
0:16:22,833 --> 0:16:26,125
- There is?
- Yeah, French food.


264
0:16:26,125 --> 0:16:30,292
We could eat some together, uh,


265
0:16:30,292 --> 0:16:33,542
Saturday night?


266
0:16:33,542 --> 0:16:37,83
You're asking me out?


267
0:16:37,83 --> 0:16:39,667
That's so cute.
What's your name again?


268
0:16:39,667 --> 0:16:43,42
Cameron. Listen, I know that
your dad doesn't let you date,


269
0:16:43,42 --> 0:16:45,292
but I thought that if
it was for French class.


270
0:16:45,292 --> 0:16:48,5
- Oh, wait a minute. Curtis-
- Cameron.


271
0:16:48,5 --> 0:16:52,458
My dad just came up with a new rule.
I can date when my sister does.


272
0:16:52,458 --> 0:16:55,375
You're kidding.
Let me ask you, do you like sailing?


273
0:16:55,375 --> 0:16:58,708
- 'Cause I read about this
place that rents boats-
- A beaucoup problemo, Calvin.


274
0:16:58,708 --> 0:17:3,83
In case you haven't heard, my sister's
a particularly hideous breed of loser.


275
0:17:3,83 --> 0:17:7,667
Yeah. Yeah, I noticed
she's a little... antisocial.


276
0:17:7,667 --> 0:17:10,833
- Why is that?
- Unsolved mystery.


277
0:17:10,833 --> 0:17:13,5
She used to be really popular,
and then it was like...


278
0:17:13,5 --> 0:17:15,833
she got sick of it or something.


279
0:17:15,833 --> 0:17:19,833
Theories abound as to why,
but I'm pretty sure she's just
incapable of human interaction.


280
0:17:19,833 --> 0:17:24,0
Plus, she's a bitch.


281
0:17:24,0 --> 0:17:26,0
Well, yeah, but I'm sure,
you know, that there are...


282
0:17:26,0 --> 0:17:29,83
lots of guys who wouldn't mind
going out with a difficult woman.


283
0:17:29,83 --> 0:17:34,42
I mean, you know, people jump out
of aeroplanes and ski off cliffs.


284
0:17:34,42 --> 0:17:38,708
It'd be like "Extreme Dating."
Huh?


285
0:17:38,708 --> 0:17:41,25
You think you could find
someone that extreme?


286
0:17:41,25 --> 0:17:43,167
Yeah, sure, why not?


287
0:17:43,167 --> 0:17:46,75
- And you'd do that for me?
- Hell, yes!


288
0:17:46,75 --> 0:17:56,0
I-I mean, you know,
I could look into it.


289
0:17:56,0 --> 0:17:59,917
Now, I have gathered a group of guys-
couldn't be more perfect.


290
0:17:59,917 --> 0:18:6,42
Padua's finest.


291
0:18:6,42 --> 0:18:9,42
Hi.
How you doin'?


292
0:18:9,42 --> 0:18:17,25
Would any of you be interested
in dating Katarina Stratford?


293
0:18:17,25 --> 0:18:19,625
I've never been that ripped.


294
0:18:19,625 --> 0:18:22,875
Maybe if we were
the last two people alive,


295
0:18:22,875 --> 0:18:24,917
and there were no sheep.


296
0:18:24,917 --> 0:18:33,458
- Are there sheep?


297
0:18:33,458 --> 0:18:36,0
Did I or did I not tell you
it was pointless?


298
0:18:36,0 --> 0:18:42,583
No one will go out with her.


299
0:18:42,583 --> 0:18:44,625
Hey, hey, what about him?


300
0:18:44,625 --> 0:18:47,417
Him? No, don't-
don't look at him, okay?


301
0:18:47,417 --> 0:18:51,542
He's a criminal.
I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.


302
0:18:51,542 --> 0:18:55,625
- He just did a year in San Quentin.
- Well, at least he's horny.


303
0:18:55,625 --> 0:18:58,333
I'm serious, man.
He's whacked.


304
0:18:58,333 --> 0:19:9,875
He sold his own liver on the
black market for a new set of speakers.


305
0:19:9,875 --> 0:19:29,167
He's our guy.


306
0:19:29,167 --> 0:19:31,292
Hi.
How you doin'?


307
0:19:31,292 --> 0:19:35,333
- Listen, I-


308
0:19:35,333 --> 0:19:45,0
Okay.
Later, then.


309
0:19:45,0 --> 0:19:47,917
How do we get him
to date Kat?


310
0:19:47,917 --> 0:19:50,792
I don't know.


311
0:19:50,792 --> 0:19:54,375
I mean, uh,
we could pay him,


312
0:19:54,375 --> 0:19:56,833
but we don't have any money.


313
0:19:56,833 --> 0:19:59,542
Yeah, well,
what we need is a backer.


314
0:19:59,542 --> 0:20:7,333
- What's that?
- Someone with money who's stupid.


315
0:20:7,333 --> 0:20:17,75
Oh, yeah.


316
0:20:17,75 --> 0:20:20,25
Is that a peach Fruit Roll-Up?
Because you don't see many-


317
0:20:20,25 --> 0:20:23,25
Oh, okay.
Yeah. All right.


318
0:20:23,25 --> 0:20:25,417
- Are you lost?
- No.


319
0:20:25,417 --> 0:20:28,625
Actually, I just came by to chat.


320
0:20:28,625 --> 0:20:31,208
- We don't chat.
- Well, actually, I thought...


321
0:20:31,208 --> 0:20:33,875
that I'd run an idea by you,
just to see if you're interested.


322
0:20:33,875 --> 0:20:36,792
- I'm not.
- Well, hear me out.


323
0:20:36,792 --> 0:20:40,42
Now, you want Bianca, right?


324
0:20:40,42 --> 0:20:43,875
But she can't go out with you
because her sister...


325
0:20:43,875 --> 0:20:47,25
is this insane head case, and no one
will go out with her, right?


326
0:20:47,25 --> 0:20:49,708
Does this conversation
have a purpose?


327
0:20:49,708 --> 0:20:52,583
What I think you need to do,


328
0:20:52,583 --> 0:20:54,875
is you need to hire a guy
who'll go out with her.


329
0:20:54,875 --> 0:20:58,375
Someone who doesn't scare so easily.


330
0:20:58,375 --> 0:21:1,833
That guy?


331
0:21:1,833 --> 0:21:5,542
- I heard he ate a live duck once.
- Everything but the beak and feet.


332
0:21:5,542 --> 0:21:9,708
Clearly, he's a solid investment.


333
0:21:9,708 --> 0:21:11,708
- What's in it for you?
- Hey.


334
0:21:11,708 --> 0:21:15,708
I'm walking down the hall and
I say hello to you, you say hello to me.


335
0:21:15,708 --> 0:21:19,42
Yeah, yeah, I get it.
You're cool by association.


336
0:21:19,42 --> 0:21:25,75
I'll think about it.


337
0:21:25,75 --> 0:21:32,75
- We're done now.
- Yeah.


338
0:21:32,75 --> 0:21:35,708
- What are you doing
getting him involved?
- Relax, now. Relax.


339
0:21:35,708 --> 0:21:37,792
We let him pretend
he's calling the shots.


340
0:21:37,792 --> 0:21:43,542
While he's busy setting things up,
you have time with Bianca.


341
0:21:43,542 --> 0:21:48,5
- That is a good idea. All right.


342
0:21:48,5 --> 0:21:55,0
I have a dick on my face, don't I?


343
0:21:55,0 --> 0:21:57,625
Now, remember, guys-


344
0:21:57,625 --> 0:22:14,208
grip it and rip it.


345
0:22:14,208 --> 0:22:20,833
Hey.
How you doin'?


346
0:22:20,833 --> 0:22:24,875
I had some great duck last night.


347
0:22:24,875 --> 0:22:27,5
Do I know you?


348
0:22:27,5 --> 0:22:31,5
You see that girl?


349
0:22:31,5 --> 0:22:34,333
- Yeah.
- That's Kat Stratford.


350
0:22:34,333 --> 0:22:36,625
- I want you to go out with her.


351
0:22:36,625 --> 0:22:40,292
Yeah, sure, Sparky.


352
0:22:40,292 --> 0:22:44,292
Look, I can't take out her sister
until Kat starts dating.


353
0:22:44,292 --> 0:22:47,125
You see, their dad's whacked out.
He's got this rule where the girls-


354
0:22:47,125 --> 0:22:50,875
That's a touching story. It really is.
Not my problem.


355
0:22:50,875 --> 0:22:53,208
Would you be willing
to make it your problem...


356
0:22:53,208 --> 0:22:57,125
if I provide generous compensation?


357
0:22:57,125 --> 0:23:0,83
You're gonna pay me
to take out some chick?


358
0:23:0,83 --> 0:23:3,417
- Mm-hmm.


359
0:23:3,417 --> 0:23:14,25
- How much?
- Twenty bucks.


360
0:23:14,25 --> 0:23:17,5
Fine, 30.


361
0:23:17,5 --> 0:23:19,542
Well, let's think about this.


362
0:23:19,542 --> 0:23:25,75
We go to the movies,
that's, uh, 15 bucks.


363
0:23:25,75 --> 0:23:30,125
We get popcorn, that's, uh, 53.


364
0:23:30,125 --> 0:23:32,542
And she'll want Raisinettes,
all right?


365
0:23:32,542 --> 0:23:36,458
So, uh, we're looking at 75 bucks.


366
0:23:36,458 --> 0:23:40,458
This isn't a negotiation.
Take it or leave it, Trailer Park.


367
0:23:40,458 --> 0:23:46,83
Fifty bucks
and we got a deal, Fabio.


368
0:23:46,83 --> 0:23:50,708
- Great practice, everybody.


369
0:23:50,708 --> 0:24:2,292
- Good hustle, Stratford.
- Thanks, Mr Chapin.


370
0:24:2,292 --> 0:24:5,83
Hey there, girlie.


371
0:24:5,83 --> 0:24:8,125
- How you doin'?
- Sweating like a pig, actually.
And yourself?


372
0:24:8,125 --> 0:24:10,792
Now, there's a way to get
a guy's attention, huh?


373
0:24:10,792 --> 0:24:13,125
My mission in life.


374
0:24:13,125 --> 0:24:15,875
But obviously, I struck your fancy,
so, you see, it worked.


375
0:24:15,875 --> 0:24:19,292
- The world makes sense again.


376
0:24:19,292 --> 0:24:24,292
- Pick you up on Friday, then.
- Oh, right. Friday. Uh-huh.


377
0:24:24,292 --> 0:24:27,458
Well, the night I take you places
you've never been before.


378
0:24:27,458 --> 0:24:29,75
Like where?
The 7- 11 on Broadway?


379
0:24:29,75 --> 0:24:32,625
Do you even know my name, screw boy?


380
0:24:32,625 --> 0:24:34,667
I know a lot more than you think.


381
0:24:34,667 --> 0:24:44,83
Doubtful.
Very doubtful.


382
0:24:44,83 --> 0:24:47,167
- We are screwed.
- Hey, I don't want to hear
that defeatist attitude.


383
0:24:47,167 --> 0:24:50,417
- I want to hear you upbeat.
- We're screwed!


384
0:24:50,417 --> 0:24:57,417
- There you go.
- Hey, Coach Chapin!


385
0:24:57,417 --> 0:25:6,625
Run, Bogey!


386
0:25:6,625 --> 0:25:8,833
Have you ever considered a new look?


387
0:25:8,833 --> 0:25:11,167
I mean, seriously. You could
have some definite potential...


388
0:25:11,167 --> 0:25:13,458
buried under all this hostility.


389
0:25:13,458 --> 0:25:16,333
I'm not hostile.
I'm annoyed.


390
0:25:16,333 --> 0:25:18,417
Why don't you try being nice?


391
0:25:18,417 --> 0:25:20,417
People wouldn't know what to think.


392
0:25:20,417 --> 0:25:23,708
- You forget,
I don't care what people think.
- Yes, you do.


393
0:25:23,708 --> 0:25:27,25
No, I don't.


394
0:25:27,25 --> 0:25:31,375
You don't always have to be
who they want you to be, you know.


395
0:25:31,375 --> 0:25:33,958
I happen to like being adored,
thank you.


396
0:25:33,958 --> 0:25:36,208
Where'd you get the pearls?


397
0:25:36,208 --> 0:25:40,875
- They're Mom's.
- And you've been what,
hiding them for three years?


398
0:25:40,875 --> 0:25:43,583
No. Daddy found them
in a drawer last week.


399
0:25:43,583 --> 0:25:45,708
So you're just gonna start
wearing them now?


400
0:25:45,708 --> 0:25:50,83
It's not like she's
coming back to claim them!


401
0:25:50,83 --> 0:25:54,208
Besides, they look good on me.


402
0:25:54,208 --> 0:26:2,0
Trust me.
They don't.


403
0:26:2,0 --> 0:26:4,708
Nice ride.
Vintage fenders.


404
0:26:4,708 --> 0:26:7,208
Are you following me?


405
0:26:7,208 --> 0:26:10,417
I was in the Laundromat.
I saw your car. I came over to say hi.


406
0:26:10,417 --> 0:26:13,542
Hi.


407
0:26:13,542 --> 0:26:16,708
- Not a big talker, huh?
- Depends on the topic.


408
0:26:16,708 --> 0:26:19,25
My fenders don't really whip me
into a verbal frenzy.


409
0:26:19,25 --> 0:26:23,458
- You're not afraid of me, are you?
- Why would I be afraid of you?


410
0:26:23,458 --> 0:26:26,0
- Well, most people are.
- Well, I'm not.


411
0:26:26,0 --> 0:26:30,42
Well, maybe you're not afraid of me, but
I'm sure you've thought about me naked.


412
0:26:30,42 --> 0:26:32,625
Am I that transparent?


413
0:26:32,625 --> 0:26:44,417
I want you, I need you.
Oh, baby, oh, baby.


414
0:26:44,417 --> 0:26:47,917
What is it, asshole day?


415
0:26:47,917 --> 0:26:59,708
- Do you mind?
- Not at all.


416
0:26:59,708 --> 0:27:4,42
- You bitch!


417
0:27:4,42 --> 0:27:7,708
Whoops.


418
0:27:7,708 --> 0:27:10,458
"Whoops"?


419
0:27:10,458 --> 0:27:13,167
My insurance does not cover P.M.S.!


420
0:27:13,167 --> 0:27:17,875
Well, then tell them I had a seizure.


421
0:27:17,875 --> 0:27:21,542
Is this about Sarah Lawrence?
Are you punishing me because
I want you to stay close to home?


422
0:27:21,542 --> 0:27:23,792
Aren't you punishing me
because Mom left?


423
0:27:23,792 --> 0:27:26,667
- You think you could leave her
out of this?
- Fine.


424
0:27:26,667 --> 0:27:30,25
- Then stop making my decisions for me.
- I'm your father. That's my right.


425
0:27:30,25 --> 0:27:32,25
So what I want doesn't matter.


426
0:27:32,25 --> 0:27:34,25
You're 18.
You don't know what you want.


427
0:27:34,25 --> 0:27:36,417
And you won't know
what you want till you're 45,


428
0:27:36,417 --> 0:27:38,958
and even if you get it,
you'll be too old to use it.


429
0:27:38,958 --> 0:27:41,83
I want to go
to an east coast school!


430
0:27:41,83 --> 0:27:43,75
I want you to trust me
to make my own choices...


431
0:27:43,75 --> 0:27:46,833
and I want you to stop
trying to control my life
just because you can't control yours!


432
0:27:46,833 --> 0:27:50,292
- Yeah? Well, you know what I want?


433
0:27:50,292 --> 0:27:53,458
We'll continue this later.


434
0:27:53,458 --> 0:27:57,75
Can't wait.


435
0:27:57,75 --> 0:28:0,42
Did you just maim Joey's car?


436
0:28:0,42 --> 0:28:2,167
Yeah. Looks like you're gonna
have to take the bus.


437
0:28:2,167 --> 0:28:5,83
Has the fact
that you're completely psycho...


438
0:28:5,83 --> 0:28:7,83
managed to escape your attention?


439
0:28:7,83 --> 0:28:14,25
Daddy!


440
0:28:14,25 --> 0:28:18,417
- When I shell out 50, I expect results.
- Yeah, I'm on it.


441
0:28:18,417 --> 0:28:21,417
Watching that bitch violate my car
doesn't count as a date.


442
0:28:21,417 --> 0:28:25,417
Now, if you don't get any,
I don't get any.


443
0:28:25,417 --> 0:28:28,667
So get some.


444
0:28:28,667 --> 0:28:30,917
I just upped my price.


445
0:28:30,917 --> 0:28:34,458
- What?
- Hundred bucks a date.


446
0:28:34,458 --> 0:28:37,792
- In advance.
- Forget it.


447
0:28:37,792 --> 0:28:44,458
Well, forget her sister, then.


448
0:28:44,458 --> 0:28:59,667
You better hope you're as smooth
as you think you are, Verona.


449
0:28:59,667 --> 0:29:1,583
- Go.
- No, you go.


450
0:29:1,583 --> 0:29:11,708
I went before.


451
0:29:11,708 --> 0:29:14,542
We know what you're trying to do
with Kat Stratford.


452
0:29:14,542 --> 0:29:17,875
Is that right?
What do you plan to do about it?


453
0:29:17,875 --> 0:29:21,83
- Help you out.
- Why's that?


454
0:29:21,83 --> 0:29:23,375
The situation is,


455
0:29:23,375 --> 0:29:28,417
my man Cameron here
has a major Jones for Bianca Stratford.


456
0:29:28,417 --> 0:29:30,75
What is it with this chick?
She have beer-flavored nipples?


457
0:29:30,75 --> 0:29:34,417
- Hey!
- I-I, uh- I think I speak correctly...


458
0:29:34,417 --> 0:29:37,208
when I say that Cameron's love is pure,


459
0:29:37,208 --> 0:29:39,208
purer than, say, Joey Donner's.


460
0:29:39,208 --> 0:29:41,75
I'm in this for the cash.
Donner can plough whoever he wants.


461
0:29:41,75 --> 0:29:44,333
Okay, there will be no ploughing.


462
0:29:44,333 --> 0:29:46,958
Patrick, uh- Pat-


463
0:29:46,958 --> 0:29:49,25
Let me explain something
to you here.


464
0:29:49,25 --> 0:29:53,25
We set this whole thing up
so Cameron can get the girl. Cameron.


465
0:29:53,25 --> 0:29:58,417
Joey's just a pawn.


466
0:29:58,417 --> 0:30:1,458
- So, you two are gonna
help me tame the wild beast.
- Absolutely.


467
0:30:1,458 --> 0:30:4,375
We'll do some research,
we'll find out what she likes.


468
0:30:4,375 --> 0:30:6,458
We're your guys.


469
0:30:6,458 --> 0:30:10,792
And he means that in
a strictly non-prison movie type of way.


470
0:30:10,792 --> 0:30:14,417
Uh,
let's start here.


471
0:30:14,417 --> 0:30:17,542
Now, Friday night,
Bogey Lowenstein is having a party.


472
0:30:17,542 --> 0:30:19,708
It's the perfect opportunity.


473
0:30:19,708 --> 0:30:24,542
- Perfect opportunity for what?
- For you to take out Kat.


474
0:30:24,542 --> 0:30:28,5
I'll think about it.


475
0:30:28,5 --> 0:30:31,25
And for a little payback.


476
0:30:31,25 --> 0:30:43,125
This is gonna be some party.


477
0:30:43,125 --> 0:30:51,5
Let's do this.


478
0:30:51,5 --> 0:31:0,0
! Sexy boy!


479
0:31:0,0 --> 0:31:5,167
! Sexy boy!


480
0:31:5,167 --> 0:31:8,5
Now, this is really important, okay?


481
0:31:8,5 --> 0:31:13,667
Which one do you like better?


482
0:31:13,667 --> 0:31:18,75
Hmm. I think I like
the white shirt better.


483
0:31:18,75 --> 0:31:22,583
- Yeah, it's- It's more-
- Pensive?


484
0:31:22,583 --> 0:31:25,292
Damn.
I was going for thoughtful.


485
0:31:25,292 --> 0:31:28,375
So, are you going to Bogie Lowenbrau's
thing on Friday night?


486
0:31:28,375 --> 0:31:30,708
Yeah, I might.


487
0:31:30,708 --> 0:31:35,958
Good, 'cause you know, I'm not
gonna bother if you won't be there.


488
0:31:35,958 --> 0:31:38,375
- See you there.


489
0:31:38,375 --> 0:31:42,792
- Okay.
- All right.


490
0:31:42,792 --> 0:31:57,333
! Sexy boy!


491
0:31:57,333 --> 0:32:0,292
So, have you heard
about Bogey Lowenstein's party?


492
0:32:0,292 --> 0:32:4,5
Yes, and I really, really,
really want to go.


493
0:32:4,5 --> 0:32:8,208
But you know I can't.
Not unless my sister does.


494
0:32:8,208 --> 0:32:10,708
Yeah, I know.
I'm working on that, but so far,


495
0:32:10,708 --> 0:32:13,375
you know, she's not going for my guy.


496
0:32:13,375 --> 0:32:16,917
- She's not a-
- K.D. Lang fan? No.


497
0:32:16,917 --> 0:32:19,333
I found a picture of Jared Leto
in her drawer once,


498
0:32:19,333 --> 0:32:22,75
so I'm pretty sure she's not
harboring same- sex tendencies.


499
0:32:22,75 --> 0:32:25,958
Okay, so that's the kind of guys
she likes- Like, pretty guys.


500
0:32:25,958 --> 0:32:28,708
I don't know.
All I've ever heard her say...


501
0:32:28,708 --> 0:32:31,292
is that she'd die before
dating a guy that smokes.


502
0:32:31,292 --> 0:32:33,792
Okay, all right, no smoking.
What else?


503
0:32:33,792 --> 0:32:36,125
You're asking me
to investigate the inner workings...


504
0:32:36,125 --> 0:32:38,125
of my sister's twisted mind?


505
0:32:38,125 --> 0:32:40,25
I don't think so.


506
0:32:40,25 --> 0:32:49,458
Well, nothing else has worked.
We need to go behind enemy lines here.


507
0:32:49,458 --> 0:32:52,458
Okay, here we go.


508
0:32:52,458 --> 0:32:54,625
Class schedule, reading list,


509
0:32:54,625 --> 0:33:2,208
date book, concert tickets,
concert tickets.


510
0:33:2,208 --> 0:33:5,0
Aha! Black panties!


511
0:33:5,0 --> 0:33:8,333
What does that tell us?


512
0:33:8,333 --> 0:33:10,458
She wants to have sex someday,
that's what.


513
0:33:10,458 --> 0:33:12,792
You-
She could just like the color.


514
0:33:12,792 --> 0:33:16,958
You don't buy black lingerie
unless you want someone to see it.


515
0:33:16,958 --> 0:33:18,542
Oh.


516
0:33:18,542 --> 0:33:24,83
So, uh-
Can I see your room?


517
0:33:24,83 --> 0:33:28,792
No.


518
0:33:28,792 --> 0:33:32,292
A girl's room is very personal.


519
0:33:32,292 --> 0:33:45,333
Oh, okay.


520
0:33:45,333 --> 0:34:2,333
- Nice bike.
- Yeah, you think so?


521
0:34:2,333 --> 0:34:6,667
Wow.
Is this what a bar looks like?


522
0:34:6,667 --> 0:34:19,75
Don't touch anything.
You may get hepatitis.


523
0:34:19,75 --> 0:34:22,333
So, what have you got for me?


524
0:34:22,333 --> 0:34:27,125
A little insight
into a very complicated girl.


525
0:34:27,125 --> 0:34:30,125
Excuse me.
Just one question before we start.


526
0:34:30,125 --> 0:34:33,83
Should you be drinking alcohol
when you don't have a liver?


527
0:34:33,83 --> 0:34:36,75
- What?
- Nothing. Nothing.


528
0:34:36,75 --> 0:34:44,0
All right, first thing.
Kat hates smokers.


529
0:34:44,0 --> 0:34:47,542
So, you're telling me
I'm a... non-smoker.


530
0:34:47,542 --> 0:34:52,0
- Yes. Well, just for now.
- And here's another problem.


531
0:34:52,0 --> 0:35:3,333
Bianca said that Kat likes pretty guys.


532
0:35:3,333 --> 0:35:6,958
- Are you telling me
I'm not a pretty guy?
- He's very pretty!


533
0:35:6,958 --> 0:35:12,375
- This is a gorgeous guy.
- I just wasn't sure. I didn't know.


534
0:35:12,375 --> 0:35:16,417
All right. Uh, yeah, okay.
Here's this.


535
0:35:16,417 --> 0:35:19,25
"Likes.


536
0:35:19,25 --> 0:35:23,583
"Thai food, feminist prose
and angry girl music...


537
0:35:23,583 --> 0:35:26,42
of the indie rock persuasion."


538
0:35:26,42 --> 0:35:31,375
Here's a list of CDs
she has in her room.


539
0:35:31,375 --> 0:35:33,5
So, I'm supposed to buy her
some noodles and a book...


540
0:35:33,5 --> 0:35:35,792
and sit around listening to chicks who
can't play their instruments, right?


541
0:35:35,792 --> 0:35:38,83
Have you ever been to Club Skunk?


542
0:35:38,83 --> 0:35:41,542
Her favorite bands
playing there tomorrow night.


543
0:35:41,542 --> 0:35:43,75
I can't be seen at Club Skunk,
all right?


544
0:35:43,75 --> 0:35:46,25
But she'll be there.
She's got tickets.


545
0:35:46,25 --> 0:35:50,375
Ass all your ears for one night.


546
0:35:50,375 --> 0:35:54,333
She has a pair of black underwear.


547
0:35:54,333 --> 0:35:56,625
If that helps.


548
0:35:56,625 --> 0:35:59,583
Couldn't hurt, right?


549
0:35:59,583 --> 0:36:14,333
!


550
0:36:14,333 --> 0:36:17,833
! You can talk!


551
0:36:17,833 --> 0:36:21,5
! You can talk about it!


552
0:36:21,5 --> 0:36:25,0
! If I'm wrong!


553
0:36:25,0 --> 0:36:28,708
! If I'm wrong
I'll take the blame!


554
0:36:28,708 --> 0:36:32,208
! You can talk!


555
0:36:32,208 --> 0:36:35,875
! As the hours slip away!


556
0:36:35,875 --> 0:36:39,375
! As my own!


557
0:36:39,375 --> 0:36:43,75
! I can call another day!


558
0:36:43,75 --> 0:36:47,333
! Come on, come on!


559
0:36:47,333 --> 0:36:50,792
! To my embrace!


560
0:36:50,792 --> 0:36:54,625
! How you sleep so easy!


561
0:36:54,625 --> 0:36:58,458
! Is a mystery!


562
0:36:58,458 --> 0:37:2,417
! You caught my ear!


563
0:37:2,417 --> 0:37:6,375
! Pressed to the glass
Pressed to the wall!


564
0:37:6,375 --> 0:37:9,667
! By the way!


565
0:37:9,667 --> 0:37:13,25
! It's your second face
I didn't see!


566
0:37:13,25 --> 0:37:15,875
! Thought what I heard!


567
0:37:15,875 --> 0:37:18,42
-!
- Verona! What are you doing here?


568
0:37:18,42 --> 0:37:20,958
I need agua!


569
0:37:20,958 --> 0:37:25,875
! All the things
I didn't know about you!


570
0:37:25,875 --> 0:37:28,542
-! So won't you come on, come on!
- Two waters.


571
0:37:28,542 --> 0:37:36,417
! Come on to my embrace!


572
0:37:36,417 --> 0:37:39,42
If you're planning on asking me out,
you might as well just get it over with.


573
0:37:39,42 --> 0:37:42,708
Do you mind?
You're kind of ruining this for me.


574
0:37:42,708 --> 0:37:45,125
You're not surrounded by
your usual cloud of smoke.


575
0:37:45,125 --> 0:37:48,167
I know. I quit.
Apparently they're bad for you.


576
0:37:48,167 --> 0:37:51,375
You think?


577
0:37:51,375 --> 0:37:54,667
You know, these guys
are no Bikini Kill or the Raincoats.


578
0:37:54,667 --> 0:37:59,833
But they're not bad.


579
0:37:59,833 --> 0:38:6,333
- You know who the Raincoats are?
- Why, don't you?


580
0:38:6,333 --> 0:38:19,25
I was watching you out there before.
I've never seen you look so sexy.


581
0:38:19,25 --> 0:38:23,25
- Come to Bogey's party with me.
- You never give up, do you?


582
0:38:23,25 --> 0:38:26,125
-!
- Was that a yes?


583
0:38:26,125 --> 0:38:30,167
- No.
- Well, then, was that a no?


584
0:38:30,167 --> 0:38:44,208
- No.
- I'll see you at 9:30 then!


585
0:38:44,208 --> 0:38:47,25
Should have used the window.


586
0:38:47,25 --> 0:38:50,458
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi.


587
0:38:50,458 --> 0:38:52,458
Where are we going?


588
0:38:52,458 --> 0:38:55,625
Well, if you must know,
a small study group of friends.


589
0:38:55,625 --> 0:38:58,0
Otherwise known as an orgy?


590
0:38:58,0 --> 0:39:0,292
Mr Stratford, it's just a party.


591
0:39:0,292 --> 0:39:3,625
And hell is just a sauna.


592
0:39:3,625 --> 0:39:6,42
Do you know anything about a party?


593
0:39:6,42 --> 0:39:9,833
- People expect me to be there.
- Kat's not going, you're not going.


594
0:39:9,833 --> 0:39:12,208
Why can't you be normal?


595
0:39:12,208 --> 0:39:15,42
- Define "normal."
- Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal.


596
0:39:15,42 --> 0:39:17,917
- What's a Bogey Lowenstein?
- Bogey's party is just a lame excuse...


597
0:39:17,917 --> 0:39:21,167
for all the idiots at our school
to drink beer
and rub up against each other...


598
0:39:21,167 --> 0:39:23,625
in hopes of distracting themselves
from the pathetic emptiness...


599
0:39:23,625 --> 0:39:26,875
- of their meaningless-
Meaningless, consumer-driven lives.


600
0:39:26,875 --> 0:39:30,167
- Can you, for just one night,


601
0:39:30,167 --> 0:39:33,333
forget that you're completely wretched
and be my sister?


602
0:39:33,333 --> 0:39:36,625
Please?


603
0:39:36,625 --> 0:39:39,208
Please?


604
0:39:39,208 --> 0:39:46,42
Come on, Kat.
Please do this for me.


605
0:39:46,42 --> 0:39:54,0
Fine.
I'll make an appearance.


606
0:39:54,0 --> 0:39:58,875
- It's starting.
- It's just a party, Daddy.


607
0:39:58,875 --> 0:40:0,875
I want you to wear the belly.


608
0:40:0,875 --> 0:40:4,0
- Daddy, no.


609
0:40:4,0 --> 0:40:6,0
Not all night.


610
0:40:6,0 --> 0:40:8,875
Just around the living room for a minute
so you can understand...


611
0:40:8,875 --> 0:40:13,708
the full weight of your decisions.


612
0:40:13,708 --> 0:40:16,0
- I am perfectly aware-
- Listen to me.


613
0:40:16,0 --> 0:40:18,333
Every time you even think
about kissing a boy,


614
0:40:18,333 --> 0:40:21,208
I want you to picture wearing this
under your halter-top.


615
0:40:21,208 --> 0:40:23,375
- You are so completely unbalanced.


616
0:40:23,375 --> 0:40:26,458
- We're going now.
- All right, wait a minute.


617
0:40:26,458 --> 0:40:28,542
No drinking, no drugs, no kissing,


618
0:40:28,542 --> 0:40:33,83
no tattoos, no piercings,
no ritual animal slaughters of any kind.


619
0:40:33,83 --> 0:40:37,708
- Oh, God, I'm giving them ideas.
- Daddy!


620
0:40:37,708 --> 0:40:40,583
- What are you doing here?
- 9:30, right?


621
0:40:40,583 --> 0:40:44,125
- Oh, I'm early.
- Whatever. I'm driving.


622
0:40:44,125 --> 0:40:50,208
Who knocked up your sister?


623
0:40:50,208 --> 0:40:52,708
So then, Bianca says that I was right,


624
0:40:52,708 --> 0:40:55,458
that she didn't wear the Kenneth Coles
with that dress...


625
0:40:55,458 --> 0:40:59,292
because she thought that it was,
uh, mixing genres, right?


626
0:40:59,292 --> 0:41:2,917
And the fact that I noticed-
and this is a direct quote, listen-


627
0:41:2,917 --> 0:41:5,5
"Really meant something."


628
0:41:5,5 --> 0:41:8,208
You told me that part already.


629
0:41:8,208 --> 0:41:10,208
I've been thinking about her
all the time.


630
0:41:10,208 --> 0:41:15,125
Stop being so self-involved
for one minute. How do I look?


631
0:41:15,125 --> 0:41:18,83
You look like my Great-Uncle Milton.


632
0:41:18,83 --> 0:41:20,417
- You think I should lose the tie?
- Yeah.


633
0:41:20,417 --> 0:41:23,83
Maybe you're right.
I'm just so nervous.


634
0:41:23,83 --> 0:41:26,125
And I'm also very excited.
I'm nervous, I'm excited.


635
0:41:26,125 --> 0:41:28,167
It's all very mixed up.
I don't know what to do!


636
0:41:28,167 --> 0:41:31,83
All right, just calm down,
all right? Shh.


637
0:41:31,83 --> 0:41:34,167
The last party I went to
was at Chuck E. Cheese.


638
0:41:34,167 --> 0:42:1,708
You want to talk about some fun.
That's a good time.


639
0:42:1,708 --> 0:42:5,667
Now, remember, guys.
Don't touch anything.


640
0:42:5,667 --> 0:42:9,917
Oop!
What did I tell you?


641
0:42:9,917 --> 0:42:24,583
- Oh. Must be Nigel with the Brie.


642
0:42:24,583 --> 0:42:40,75
!


643
0:42:40,75 --> 0:42:45,0
You know, I'm-
I'm thinking of getting a Tercel.


644
0:42:45,0 --> 0:42:48,875
Yeah, that's a Toyota.


645
0:42:48,875 --> 0:42:58,792
It has dual side air bags
and a spacious back seat.


646
0:42:58,792 --> 0:43:1,375
- Kiss me!
- Kiss him.


647
0:43:1,375 --> 0:43:6,958
- Okay.
- Good.


648
0:43:6,958 --> 0:43:12,208
- Hey, thanks, man!


649
0:43:12,208 --> 0:43:14,583
Sweet.


650
0:43:14,583 --> 0:43:17,375
Looking fresh tonight, pussycat.


651
0:43:17,375 --> 0:43:21,667
Wait. Was that-
Did your hairline just recede?


652
0:43:21,667 --> 0:43:24,542
- Hey, where are you goin'?
- Away.


653
0:43:24,542 --> 0:43:27,83
- Your sister here?
- Stay away from my sister.


654
0:43:27,83 --> 0:43:29,833
Oh, I'll stay away
from your sister.


655
0:43:29,833 --> 0:43:32,417
But I can't guarantee
she'll stay away from me.


656
0:43:32,417 --> 0:43:43,917
- Fight!
- Ooh, fight!


657
0:43:43,917 --> 0:43:51,917
You guys, please!
Take it outside!


658
0:43:51,917 --> 0:43:55,833
Thank you!


659
0:43:55,833 --> 0:44:0,83
Hey, Kat.
Look who found me.


660
0:44:0,83 --> 0:44:3,417
- Bianca, wait.
- Please do not address me in public.


661
0:44:3,417 --> 0:44:5,417
No, there's something
I need to tell you.


662
0:44:5,417 --> 0:44:9,125
I am busy enjoying my adolescence,
so scamper off and do the same.


663
0:44:9,125 --> 0:44:13,875
Bu-bye.


664
0:44:13,875 --> 0:44:16,83
Want one?


665
0:44:16,83 --> 0:44:18,708
- What is this?
- Right on, sister!


666
0:44:18,708 --> 0:44:21,792
- I've been looking
all over the place for you.


667
0:44:21,792 --> 0:44:24,708
I'm getting trashed, man. Isn't that
what you're supposed to do at a party?


668
0:44:24,708 --> 0:44:26,958
I don't know.
I say do what you want to do.


669
0:44:26,958 --> 0:44:29,417
Funny.
You're the only one.


670
0:44:29,417 --> 0:44:43,375
Later.


671
0:44:43,375 --> 0:44:45,958
Lord of the dance!
Hi, Heather.


672
0:44:45,958 --> 0:44:48,958
- Bite me.
- Should've kept the tie.


673
0:44:48,958 --> 0:44:52,83
Hey. Hey, have you seen her
around anywhere?


674
0:44:52,83 --> 0:44:55,125
- Relax.
- Relax? I'm fine.


675
0:44:55,125 --> 0:44:59,833
Follow the love.


676
0:44:59,833 --> 0:45:2,125
Hi, Bianca.


677
0:45:2,125 --> 0:45:5,833
Oh, hi, Cameron.


678
0:45:5,833 --> 0:45:8,625
Um, you know Chastity?


679
0:45:8,625 --> 0:45:12,625
Uh, yeah. I think, uh,
we have art together, right?


680
0:45:12,625 --> 0:45:15,0
Neat.


681
0:45:15,0 --> 0:45:18,25
So, um, you-


682
0:45:18,25 --> 0:45:21,75
You really look amazing.


683
0:45:21,75 --> 0:45:24,667
- Thanks.
- And we all know I look amazing.


684
0:45:24,667 --> 0:45:27,42
- Yeah.


685
0:45:27,42 --> 0:45:31,167
Bianca, let's go. We're all
congregating around Mr Cuervo.


686
0:45:31,167 --> 0:45:45,833
Um, I'll see you around, okay?


687
0:45:45,833 --> 0:45:48,75
- So, I've got the Sears
catalogue thing going...


688
0:45:48,75 --> 0:45:54,958
and the tube sock gig-
that is gonna be huge.


689
0:45:54,958 --> 0:45:57,292
And I'm up for
a hemorrhoid cream ad next week.


690
0:45:57,292 --> 0:45:59,833
I know it sounds
kind of bogus, but...


691
0:45:59,833 --> 0:46:10,625
I get to do some acting.


692
0:46:10,625 --> 0:46:13,75
- You see what I did there?
- Uh-huh.


693
0:46:13,75 --> 0:46:19,958
That was underwear. I'll show you
the bathing suit one again.


694
0:46:19,958 --> 0:46:23,417
You see the difference?


695
0:46:23,417 --> 0:46:31,875
All right, I'll show you guys.


696
0:46:31,875 --> 0:46:38,75
Ohhh!


697
0:46:38,75 --> 0:46:45,292
! Please tell me I am crazy!


698
0:46:45,292 --> 0:46:51,333
! That I'm wasting time with you!


699
0:46:51,333 --> 0:46:56,208
! You'll never be mine!


700
0:46:56,208 --> 0:47:5,667
Is it me, or does this party
all of a sudden suck?


701
0:47:5,667 --> 0:47:8,0
Really, really,


702
0:47:8,0 --> 0:47:10,25
thank you!


703
0:47:10,25 --> 0:47:12,917
Hey. Hey, Kat, why don't you
let me have this one, huh?


704
0:47:12,917 --> 0:47:15,958
No!
This one's mine.


705
0:47:15,958 --> 0:47:18,875
My man!
How did you get her to do it?


706
0:47:18,875 --> 0:47:21,125
- Do what?
- Act like a human.


707
0:47:21,125 --> 0:47:25,375
-!
- Yeah! All right!


708
0:47:25,375 --> 0:47:31,458
Go!


709
0:47:31,458 --> 0:47:40,125
See this?


710
0:47:40,125 --> 0:48:4,708
Whoo!


711
0:48:4,708 --> 0:48:9,917
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.


712
0:48:9,917 --> 0:48:13,375
You're not fine.
Come on.


713
0:48:13,375 --> 0:48:17,375
- I just need to lie down.
- Uh- huh. You lie down
and you'll go to sleep.


714
0:48:17,375 --> 0:48:20,167
- Sleep is good.
- Not if you have a concussion.


715
0:48:20,167 --> 0:48:23,542
Come on.
Here, sit down.


716
0:48:23,542 --> 0:48:26,208
- Sit.
- Hey, hey, we need to talk.


717
0:48:26,208 --> 0:48:33,875
- I'm a little busy right now.
- Can you give me a second?


718
0:48:33,875 --> 0:48:36,208
- What?
- It's off, okay? The whole things off.


719
0:48:36,208 --> 0:48:39,42
- What are you talking about?


720
0:48:39,42 --> 0:48:42,208
She never wanted me.
She wanted Joey the whole time.


721
0:48:42,208 --> 0:48:44,792
Cameron, do you like the girl?


722
0:48:44,792 --> 0:48:47,833
- Yeah.
- And is she worth all this trouble?


723
0:48:47,833 --> 0:48:49,958
I thought she was, but, you know, I-


724
0:48:49,958 --> 0:48:51,542
Well, she is or she isn't.


725
0:48:51,542 --> 0:48:54,75
See, first of all,
Joey is not half the man you are.


726
0:48:54,75 --> 0:48:59,625
Secondly, don't let anyone
ever make you feel like
you don't deserve what you want.


727
0:48:59,625 --> 0:49:4,958
Go for it!


728
0:49:4,958 --> 0:49:17,42
- Come on.
- Why?


729
0:49:17,42 --> 0:49:19,42
- This is so patronizing.


730
0:49:19,42 --> 0:49:21,417
Leave it to you to use big words
when you're smashed.


731
0:49:21,417 --> 0:49:26,83
- I don't think so.
- Kat.


732
0:49:26,83 --> 0:49:29,208
- Why are you doing this?
- I told you. You may have a concussion.


733
0:49:29,208 --> 0:49:31,208
You don't care if I never wake up.


734
0:49:31,208 --> 0:49:33,208
- Sure I do.
- Why?


735
0:49:33,208 --> 0:49:36,167
Because then I'd have to start
taking out girls who actually like me.


736
0:49:36,167 --> 0:49:38,458
- Like you could find one.
- Oh, see? That, there.


737
0:49:38,458 --> 0:49:40,625
Who needs affection
when I have blind hatred?


738
0:49:40,625 --> 0:49:49,583
- I just- Let me sit down for a while.
- All right. There.


739
0:49:49,583 --> 0:49:59,83
- Gees!
- Whoo!


740
0:49:59,83 --> 0:50:1,583
- So, why'd you let him get to you?
- Who?


741
0:50:1,583 --> 0:50:4,625
- Joey.
- I hate him.


742
0:50:4,625 --> 0:50:10,833
Well, you've chosen the perfect
revenge- mainlining tequila.


743
0:50:10,833 --> 0:50:15,583
- Well, you know what they say.
- Nope. What do they say?


744
0:50:15,583 --> 0:50:18,833
No, no, no, no. Kat, come on, wake up!
Look at me!


745
0:50:18,833 --> 0:50:27,833
Listen to me, Kat!
Open your eyes!


746
0:50:27,833 --> 0:50:29,958
Hey.


747
0:50:29,958 --> 0:50:49,625
Your eyes have
a little green in them.


748
0:50:49,625 --> 0:50:51,75
I don't know if we should go.


749
0:50:51,75 --> 0:50:54,667
Hey, a bunch of us
are going to Jarrett's. Ready?


750
0:50:54,667 --> 0:50:57,292
Um, I have to be home in 20 minutes.


751
0:50:57,292 --> 0:51:0,833
Well, you know I don't have to be home
till 2:00, so-


752
0:51:0,833 --> 0:51:4,75
- One more chance.
- Aw, man, I can't.


753
0:51:4,75 --> 0:51:8,292
- Damn.
- That's a shame.


754
0:51:8,292 --> 0:51:10,333
- You wanna go?
- Sure.


755
0:51:10,333 --> 0:51:13,375
- Chastity!
- Hey, you passed.


756
0:51:13,375 --> 0:51:19,208
Bitch.


757
0:51:19,208 --> 0:51:22,75
- Hey. Have fun tonight?
- Tons.


758
0:51:22,75 --> 0:51:26,375
Hey, Cameron?
Um-


759
0:51:26,375 --> 0:51:31,458
Do you think you could
give me a ride home?


760
0:51:31,458 --> 0:51:34,542
-!
- I should do this.


761
0:51:34,542 --> 0:51:37,542
- Do what?
- This!


762
0:51:37,542 --> 0:51:40,5
- Start a band?
- No, install car stereos.


763
0:51:40,5 --> 0:51:45,167
Yeah, start a band.
My father would love that.


764
0:51:45,167 --> 0:51:48,0
! I pick myself up off the ground!


765
0:51:48,0 --> 0:51:50,83
! To have you knock me back down!


766
0:51:50,83 --> 0:51:53,83
! Again and again!


767
0:51:53,83 --> 0:51:57,333
! And when I ask you to explain!


768
0:51:57,333 --> 0:52:1,417
You don't strike me as the type that
would ask your father for permission.


769
0:52:1,417 --> 0:52:4,917
- Oh, so now you think you know me?
- I'm getting there.


770
0:52:4,917 --> 0:52:9,792
The only thing people know
about me is that I'm scary.


771
0:52:9,792 --> 0:52:18,75
Yeah, well, I'm no picnic myself.


772
0:52:18,75 --> 0:52:23,25
Uh, so what's up with your dad?
Is he- Is he a pain in the ass?


773
0:52:23,25 --> 0:52:26,583
No, he just wants me to be
somebody that I'm not.


774
0:52:26,583 --> 0:52:28,583
- Who?
- Bianca.


775
0:52:28,583 --> 0:52:33,958
Oh, Bianca.


776
0:52:33,958 --> 0:52:37,125
No offence or anything- I mean
I know everyone "digs" your sister-


777
0:52:37,125 --> 0:52:47,125
but, um, she's without.


778
0:52:47,125 --> 0:52:50,458
You know,


779
0:52:50,458 --> 0:53:2,75
you're not as vile
as I thought you were.


780
0:53:2,75 --> 0:53:51,125
Maybe we should do this another time.


781
0:53:51,125 --> 0:53:55,708
You never wanted
to go sailing with me, did you?


782
0:53:55,708 --> 0:53:58,292
Yes, I did.


783
0:53:58,292 --> 0:54:1,792
No, you didn't.


784
0:54:1,792 --> 0:54:4,5
Okay, no, not actually-


785
0:54:4,5 --> 0:54:9,375
Well, then that's all
you had to say.


786
0:54:9,375 --> 0:54:14,917
Have you always been this selfish?


787
0:54:14,917 --> 0:54:19,75
Yes.


788
0:54:19,75 --> 0:54:21,75
You know, just 'cause you're beautiful,


789
0:54:21,75 --> 0:54:26,0
that doesn't mean that you can
treat people like they don't matter.


790
0:54:26,0 --> 0:54:29,375
I mean, I really liked you, okay.


791
0:54:29,375 --> 0:54:32,208
I-I defended you
when people called you conceited,


792
0:54:32,208 --> 0:54:34,167
I helped you when you asked me to,


793
0:54:34,167 --> 0:55:8,417
I learned French for you and then
you just blow me off so you could just-


794
0:55:8,417 --> 0:55:14,83
And I'm back in the game!


795
0:55:14,83 --> 0:55:18,708
Kat, me lady.
You sway to the rhythm of me heart.


796
0:55:18,708 --> 0:55:20,708
Dance for me, cowgirl.


797
0:55:20,708 --> 0:55:23,583
Kat babe, what do we owe you
for the table dance?


798
0:55:23,583 --> 0:55:27,625
All right, not that I give a damn,
but how was everybody's weekend?


799
0:55:27,625 --> 0:55:30,708
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe we should ask Kat.


800
0:55:30,708 --> 0:55:32,708
Unless she kicked the crap
out of your dumb butt,


801
0:55:32,708 --> 0:55:34,417
I don't wanna hear about it.


802
0:55:34,417 --> 0:55:39,625
Okay, let's open up our books
to page 73, Sonnet 141.


803
0:55:39,625 --> 0:55:41,667
And listen up.


804
0:55:41,667 --> 0:55:45,708
In faith, I do not love thee
with mine eyes. For they and thee
a thousand errors note.


805
0:55:45,708 --> 0:55:48,208
But 'tis my heart loves what
they despise.


806
0:55:48,208 --> 0:55:51,958
Who in despite of view
is pleased to dote.


807
0:55:51,958 --> 0:55:55,708
Now, I know Shakespeare's
a dead white guy,


808
0:55:55,708 --> 0:55:58,292
but he knows his shit,
so we can overlook that.


809
0:55:58,292 --> 0:56:3,458
I want you all to write
your own version of this sonnet.


810
0:56:3,458 --> 0:56:6,625
Yes, Miss I-Have-An-Opinion-
About- Everything?


811
0:56:6,625 --> 0:56:8,75
Do you want this
in iambic pentameter?


812
0:56:8,75 --> 0:56:11,708
You're not gonna fight me on this?


813
0:56:11,708 --> 0:56:13,75
No, I think it's
a really good assignment.


814
0:56:13,75 --> 0:56:17,42
You're just
messing' with me, aren't you?


815
0:56:17,42 --> 0:56:21,125
- No, I'm really looking forward
to writing it.
- Get out of my class.


816
0:56:21,125 --> 0:56:30,542
- What?
- Out. Get out!


817
0:56:30,542 --> 0:56:45,75
- Thanks, Mr Morgan.
- Shut up.


818
0:56:45,75 --> 0:56:50,83
! I can't get enough of you, baby!


819
0:56:50,83 --> 0:56:53,542
! I can't get enough of you, baby!


820
0:56:53,542 --> 0:56:56,708
! Yes, it's true!


821
0:56:56,708 --> 0:57:0,375
Hey. Cool picture.


822
0:57:0,375 --> 0:57:6,417
What's that collar for? Is that
to keep him from licking his stitches?


823
0:57:6,417 --> 0:57:11,0
Kidding. No, because I know
you're a fan of Shakespeare.


824
0:57:11,0 --> 0:57:15,333
More than a fan.
We're involved.


825
0:57:15,333 --> 0:57:17,875
Okay.


826
0:57:17,875 --> 0:57:21,875
Who could refrain,
that had a heart to love...


827
0:57:21,875 --> 0:57:26,208
- and in that heart-
- Courage to make love known.


828
0:57:26,208 --> 0:57:31,83
- That's Mac Beth, right?
- Right.


829
0:57:31,83 --> 0:57:35,83
So, listen, I-
I have this friend...


830
0:57:35,83 --> 0:57:44,25
and he likes your friend-


831
0:57:44,25 --> 0:57:46,417
What did you do to her?


832
0:57:46,417 --> 0:57:49,25
I didn't do anything.
She would've been too drunk to remember.


833
0:57:49,25 --> 0:57:53,917
- But the plan was working.
- What do you care?
I thought you wanted out.


834
0:57:53,917 --> 0:57:56,292
Yeah, well, I did, but, uh,


835
0:57:56,292 --> 0:57:58,667
that was until she kissed me.


836
0:57:58,667 --> 0:58:4,667
- Where?
- In the car.


837
0:58:4,667 --> 0:58:6,667
Sorry.


838
0:58:6,667 --> 0:58:8,667
- Dweeb! Puts!
- I'm sorry.


839
0:58:8,667 --> 0:58:11,75
- All right, I talked to her.
I got the scoop.
- What'd she say?


840
0:58:11,75 --> 0:58:14,125
"Hates with him the fire
of a thousand suns."


841
0:58:14,125 --> 0:58:16,792
That's a direct quote.


842
0:58:16,792 --> 0:58:19,75
Thanks, Malcolm.
That's very comforting of you.


843
0:58:19,75 --> 0:58:29,42
We don't know.
She could need a day to cool off.


844
0:58:29,42 --> 0:58:34,333
Maybe two.


845
0:58:34,333 --> 0:58:38,208
! Take time for your pleasure
and laugh with love!


846
0:58:38,208 --> 0:58:42,292
! Take the hand of another
and sing for the wings of a dove!


847
0:58:42,292 --> 0:58:43,833
Hey!


848
0:58:43,833 --> 0:58:47,0
Can you imagine who would go to
that antiquated mating ritual?


849
0:58:47,0 --> 0:58:49,292
I would, but I don't have a date.


850
0:58:49,292 --> 0:58:51,292
Do you really want
to get all dressed up...


851
0:58:51,292 --> 0:58:54,583
so some Drakkar Noir-wearing Dexter
with a boner can feel you up...


852
0:58:54,583 --> 0:58:57,958
while you're forced to listen
to a band that by definition blows?


853
0:58:57,958 --> 0:59:0,333
All right, all right, we won't go.


854
0:59:0,333 --> 0:59:2,75
It's not like I've got a dress anyway.


855
0:59:2,75 --> 0:59:5,333
You're looking at this from
entirely the wrong perspective.


856
0:59:5,333 --> 0:59:7,333
We're making a statement.


857
0:59:7,333 --> 0:59:11,83
Oh, goody.
Something new and different for us.


858
0:59:11,83 --> 0:59:13,333
! Whoa, whoa!


859
0:59:13,333 --> 0:59:15,333
! For the wings of a dove!


860
0:59:15,333 --> 0:59:17,417
! Whoa, whoa!


861
0:59:17,417 --> 0:59:19,417
! For the wings of a dove!


862
0:59:19,417 --> 0:59:21,583
-! Whoa, whoa!
-! Yeah, yeah, yeah!


863
0:59:21,583 --> 0:59:23,583
! For the wings of a dove!


864
0:59:23,583 --> 0:59:25,792
! Whoa, whoa!


865
0:59:25,792 --> 0:59:28,42
! For the wings of a do-o-ove!


866
0:59:28,42 --> 0:59:31,833
- Hey there, Cupid.
- Hi, Joey.


867
0:59:31,833 --> 0:59:35,25
You're concentrating awfully hard
considering it's gym class.


868
0:59:35,25 --> 0:59:37,25
- Can I help you?


869
0:59:37,25 --> 0:59:39,25
I want to talk to you about prom.


870
0:59:39,25 --> 0:59:44,875
Ow! Ow-ooo!


871
0:59:44,875 --> 0:59:47,958
Look, you know the deal:
I can't go if Kat doesn't go.


872
0:59:47,958 --> 0:59:50,708
Your sister is going.


873
0:59:50,708 --> 1:0:0,42
- Since when?
- Let's just say I'm taking care of it.


874
1:0:0,42 --> 1:0:3,708
This should take care of the flowers,
the limo, the tux, everything.


875
1:0:3,708 --> 1:0:6,458
Just make sure she gets to the prom.


876
1:0:6,458 --> 1:0:9,875
Do you know what?
I'm sick of playing your little game.


877
1:0:9,875 --> 1:0:11,875
Okay, wait, wait, wait.


878
1:0:11,875 --> 1:0:34,25
You sick of, let's say, 300?


879
1:0:34,25 --> 1:0:37,417
! I'm not the sort of person!


880
1:0:37,417 --> 1:0:40,83
! Who falls!


881
1:0:40,83 --> 1:0:44,125
! In and quickly out of love!


882
1:0:44,125 --> 1:0:48,583
! But to you I gave my affection!


883
1:0:48,583 --> 1:0:53,458
! Right from the start!


884
1:0:53,458 --> 1:0:56,208
! I have a lover!


885
1:0:56,208 --> 1:0:58,833
! Who loves me!


886
1:0:58,833 --> 1:1:3,25
! How could I break such a heart!


887
1:1:3,25 --> 1:1:11,5
! And still you get my attention!


888
1:1:11,5 --> 1:1:14,5
! Why do you come here!


889
1:1:14,5 --> 1:1:18,583
! When you know
I've got troubles enough!


890
1:1:18,583 --> 1:1:22,125
! Why do you call me!


891
1:1:22,125 --> 1:1:26,125
! When you know
I can't answer the phone!


892
1:1:26,125 --> 1:1:31,208
! Make me lie and I don't want to!


893
1:1:31,208 --> 1:1:37,917
! And make someone else
some kind of an unknowing' fool!


894
1:1:37,917 --> 1:1:41,167
Excuse me. Have you seen The
Feminine Mystique? I've lost my copy.


895
1:1:41,167 --> 1:1:43,833
- What are you doing here?
- I heard there was a poetry reading.


896
1:1:43,833 --> 1:1:46,958
- You're so-
- Charming.


897
1:1:46,958 --> 1:1:49,42
Wholesome.


898
1:1:49,42 --> 1:1:51,167
Unwelcome.


899
1:1:51,167 --> 1:1:55,458
You're not as mean as you think you are,
you know that?


900
1:1:55,458 --> 1:1:57,833
And you're not as badass
as you think you are.


901
1:1:57,833 --> 1:2:0,5
Ooo, someone still has
her panties in a twist.


902
1:2:0,5 --> 1:2:3,958
Don't for one minute think that you had
any effect whatsoever on my panties.


903
1:2:3,958 --> 1:2:5,917
Then what did I have an effect on?


904
1:2:5,917 --> 1:2:20,542
Other than my upchuck reflex,
nothing.


905
1:2:20,542 --> 1:2:23,125
You're right, she's still pissed.


906
1:2:23,125 --> 1:2:25,333
Sweet love, renew thy force.


907
1:2:25,333 --> 1:2:29,542
Hey! Don't say shit like that to me.
People can hear you.


908
1:2:29,542 --> 1:2:31,542
Look, you embarrassed the girl.


909
1:2:31,542 --> 1:2:38,417
Sacrifice yourself on
the altar of dignity and even the score.


910
1:2:38,417 --> 1:2:41,458
Listen, don't say shit like that to him.


911
1:2:41,458 --> 1:2:44,167
People can hear you.


912
1:2:44,167 --> 1:2:49,542
! There's a new kind of world
that's taking over!


913
1:2:49,542 --> 1:2:52,917
! It's got devils
It's got angels!


914
1:2:52,917 --> 1:2:55,167
! Sitting on my shoulders!


915
1:2:55,167 --> 1:3:13,5
! There's a new kind of world
that's taking over!


916
1:3:13,5 --> 1:3:17,667
! You're just too good to be true!


917
1:3:17,667 --> 1:3:21,75
! Can't take my eyes off of you!


918
1:3:21,75 --> 1:3:24,958
! You'd be like heaven to touch!


919
1:3:24,958 --> 1:3:29,125
! I wanna hold you so much!


920
1:3:29,125 --> 1:3:33,208
! At long last love has arrived!


921
1:3:33,208 --> 1:3:37,83
! And I thank God I'm alive!


922
1:3:37,83 --> 1:3:40,708
! You're just too good to be true!


923
1:3:40,708 --> 1:3:44,833
! Can't take my eyes off of you!


924
1:3:44,833 --> 1:4:1,625
-!


925
1:4:1,625 --> 1:4:4,542
-! I love you, baby!
-!


926
1:4:4,542 --> 1:4:8,0
! And if it's quite all right
I need you, baby!


927
1:4:8,0 --> 1:4:12,583
! To warm the lonely night
I love you, baby!


928
1:4:12,583 --> 1:4:17,333
! Trust in me when I say!


929
1:4:17,333 --> 1:4:19,833
! Oh, pretty baby!


930
1:4:19,833 --> 1:4:23,667
! Don't bring me down, I pray
Oh, pretty baby!


931
1:4:23,667 --> 1:4:29,5
! Now that I found you, stay
and let me love you, baby!


932
1:4:29,5 --> 1:5:18,917
! Let me love you!


933
1:5:18,917 --> 1:5:21,208
You look pretty nervous.


934
1:5:21,208 --> 1:5:24,83
Yes, sir.


935
1:5:24,83 --> 1:5:26,333
You're sweating like a pig.


936
1:5:26,333 --> 1:5:28,708
Yes, sir.


937
1:5:28,708 --> 1:5:31,375
Your eyes are all... bloodshot.


938
1:5:31,375 --> 1:5:33,75
Yes, sir.


939
1:5:33,75 --> 1:5:42,292
You've got pot, don't you?


940
1:5:42,292 --> 1:5:53,5
I'm confiscating this.


941
1:5:53,5 --> 1:5:59,792
This too.


942
1:5:59,792 --> 1:6:2,917
Mr Chapin, can I talk to you
for a second?


943
1:6:2,917 --> 1:6:4,917
What can I do for you, Stratford?


944
1:6:4,917 --> 1:6:7,833
I have some ideas on how
we can improve the girls' soccer team.


945
1:6:7,833 --> 1:6:12,333
Great!
Let's talk about it later.


946
1:6:12,333 --> 1:6:15,292
The window.


947
1:6:15,292 --> 1:6:18,208
The window.


948
1:6:18,208 --> 1:6:21,792
As you know, we have
a really big game with Hillcrest High-


949
1:6:21,792 --> 1:6:24,208
Your bicep is huge!


950
1:6:24,208 --> 1:6:26,542
Oh, my God.
The other one's even bigger.


951
1:6:26,542 --> 1:6:29,625
You don't take steroids, do you,
because I've heard steroids...


952
1:6:29,625 --> 1:6:32,25
can severely disintegrate
your... package?


953
1:6:32,25 --> 1:6:34,958
- Not that I'm thinking
about your package.


954
1:6:34,958 --> 1:6:37,292
- That's not the point.
- Let's hope not.


955
1:6:37,292 --> 1:6:40,958
- The point is they kick
our butts every year.


956
1:6:40,958 --> 1:6:45,333
I was thinking, I devised a plan that
will enable us to finally defeat them.


957
1:6:45,333 --> 1:6:47,333
Which is?


958
1:6:47,333 --> 1:6:50,42
- That thing that you taught us.
- What thing?


959
1:6:50,42 --> 1:6:52,792
- Misdirection.
- I taught you that?


960
1:6:52,792 --> 1:6:56,75
Yeah, you or Siegfried or Roy?
Anyway, that's not important.


961
1:6:56,75 --> 1:6:59,667
- The- Think about it.


962
1:6:59,667 --> 1:7:2,25
Um, they're looking left
and we're running right.


963
1:7:2,25 --> 1:7:4,5
Bang, we score. We win.


964
1:7:4,5 --> 1:7:7,5
Okay, but how do we get 'em
to look left?


965
1:7:7,5 --> 1:7:18,167
- Um, like this.


966
1:7:18,167 --> 1:7:21,75
Okay. Well,


967
1:7:21,75 --> 1:7:24,458
now that you've seen "the plan,"


968
1:7:24,458 --> 1:7:30,25
I'm gonna go and show "the plan"
to someone else.


969
1:7:30,25 --> 1:7:32,667
Okay.


970
1:7:32,667 --> 1:7:42,208
Hi.


971
1:7:42,208 --> 1:7:45,25
I can't thank you enough
for helping me sneak out of detention.


972
1:7:45,25 --> 1:7:47,25
- Very cool.
- No problem.


973
1:7:47,25 --> 1:7:50,667
I thought for sure I was busted when I
was climbing out that window, I tell ya.


974
1:7:50,667 --> 1:7:52,833
So, how did you keep him distracted?


975
1:7:52,833 --> 1:7:59,25
I dazzled him with my... wits.


976
1:7:59,25 --> 1:8:1,875
- So, what's your excuse?
- For?


977
1:8:1,875 --> 1:8:4,958
For acting the way we do?


978
1:8:4,958 --> 1:8:6,958
I don't like to do what people expect.


979
1:8:6,958 --> 1:8:10,167
Why should I live up to other people's
expectations instead of my own?


980
1:8:10,167 --> 1:8:14,542
So, you disappoint 'em from the start
and then you're covered, right?


981
1:8:14,542 --> 1:8:18,542
Something like that.


982
1:8:18,542 --> 1:8:22,75
- Then you screwed up.
- How?


983
1:8:22,75 --> 1:8:33,667
You never disappointed me.


984
1:8:33,667 --> 1:8:35,917
Are you up for it?


985
1:8:35,917 --> 1:8:49,25
Up for what?


986
1:8:49,25 --> 1:8:52,75
! Fascinating new thing!


987
1:8:52,75 --> 1:8:54,167
-! You delight me!


988
1:8:54,167 --> 1:8:57,417
! And I know you're speaking of me!


989
1:8:57,417 --> 1:9:1,0
-! Fascinating new thing!


990
1:9:1,0 --> 1:9:3,83
-! Get beside me!


991
1:9:3,83 --> 1:9:8,333
! I want you to love me!


992
1:9:8,333 --> 1:9:13,375
! I'm surprised that
you've never been told before!


993
1:9:13,375 --> 1:9:16,625
-! That you're lovely
and you're perfect!


994
1:9:16,625 --> 1:9:36,792
! And that somebody wants you!


995
1:9:36,792 --> 1:9:41,833
! I'm surprised that
you've never been told before!


996
1:9:41,833 --> 1:9:44,292
! That you're lovely
and you're perfect!


997
1:9:44,292 --> 1:9:46,625
! And that somebody wants you!


998
1:9:46,625 --> 1:9:51,458
! I'm surprised that
you've never been told before!


999
1:9:51,458 --> 1:9:54,42
! That you're priceless
Yeah, you're holy!


1000
1:9:54,42 --> 1:9:59,0
! Even when you are not new!


1001
1:9:59,0 --> 1:10:2,167
- All right, come on.


1002
1:10:2,167 --> 1:10:6,542
! Fascinating new thing!


1003
1:10:6,542 --> 1:10:9,167
! Fascinating new thing!


1004
1:10:9,167 --> 1:10:17,25
! All right!


1005
1:10:17,25 --> 1:10:19,542
No, none of that stuff is true.


1006
1:10:19,542 --> 1:10:22,792
- State trooper.
- Fallacy. Dead guy in the parking lot?


1007
1:10:22,792 --> 1:10:24,833
Rumor. The duck?


1008
1:10:24,833 --> 1:10:27,333
Hearsay.
Bobby Ridgeway's balls?


1009
1:10:27,333 --> 1:10:30,333
Fact. But he deserved it.
He tried to grope me in the lunch line.


1010
1:10:30,333 --> 1:10:32,5
- Fair enough.
- The accent?


1011
1:10:32,5 --> 1:10:36,25
It's real.
I lived in Australia until I was ten.


1012
1:10:36,25 --> 1:10:39,417
- With the Pygmies?
- Close.


1013
1:10:39,417 --> 1:10:42,375
With my mom.


1014
1:10:42,375 --> 1:10:45,708
Where were you last year?
I know the porn career is a lie.


1015
1:10:45,708 --> 1:10:55,292
Do you?


1016
1:10:55,292 --> 1:11:1,167
- Tell me something true.
- Something true.


1017
1:11:1,167 --> 1:11:3,25
I hate peas.


1018
1:11:3,25 --> 1:11:6,917
No. Something real.
Something no one else knows.


1019
1:11:6,917 --> 1:11:11,5
Okay. You're sweet...


1020
1:11:11,5 --> 1:11:15,458
and sexy...


1021
1:11:15,458 --> 1:11:18,42
and completely hot for me.


1022
1:11:18,42 --> 1:11:21,417
You are amazingly self-assured.
Has anyone ever told you that?


1023
1:11:21,417 --> 1:11:27,833
I tell myself that every day, actually.


1024
1:11:27,833 --> 1:11:31,875
- Go to the prom with me.
- Is that a request or a command?


1025
1:11:31,875 --> 1:11:34,25
Come on. Go with me.


1026
1:11:34,25 --> 1:11:37,542
- No.
- No? Why not?


1027
1:11:37,542 --> 1:11:40,0
Because I don't want to.
Because it's a stupid tradition.


1028
1:11:40,0 --> 1:11:43,25
Come on.
People won't expect you to go.


1029
1:11:43,25 --> 1:11:47,25
Why are you pushing this?


1030
1:11:47,25 --> 1:11:50,75
What's in it for you?


1031
1:11:50,75 --> 1:11:53,333
Oh.


1032
1:11:53,333 --> 1:11:56,292
S-So now I need to have a motive
to want to be with you?


1033
1:11:56,292 --> 1:11:58,292
You tell me.


1034
1:11:58,292 --> 1:12:2,83
Oh, f-
You need therapy, you know that?


1035
1:12:2,83 --> 1:12:4,958
Has anyone ever told you that?


1036
1:12:4,958 --> 1:12:7,333
- Answer the question, Patrick.
- Nothing!


1037
1:12:7,333 --> 1:12:36,42
There is nothing in it for me,
just the pleasure of your company. Okay?


1038
1:12:36,42 --> 1:12:50,833
Wait. Wait a minute.
That- That's not on this page.


1039
1:12:50,833 --> 1:13:18,667
Merde.


1040
1:13:18,667 --> 1:13:22,333
Seven!


1041
1:13:22,333 --> 1:13:28,208
Good.


1042
1:13:28,208 --> 1:13:30,542
- Daddy?
- Hi, honey.


1043
1:13:30,542 --> 1:13:41,167
I'd like to discuss tomorrow night
with you. As you know, it's the prom-


1044
1:13:41,167 --> 1:13:43,875
The prom? Kat has a date?


1045
1:13:43,875 --> 1:13:46,917
Well, no.


1046
1:13:46,917 --> 1:13:51,958
Don't think you're fooling me.
I know who you wanna bend the rules for.
It's that hot-rod Joey.


1047
1:13:51,958 --> 1:13:54,75
What's a hot rod?


1048
1:13:54,75 --> 1:13:59,375
It's a- If your sister's not going,
you're not going. End of story.


1049
1:13:59,375 --> 1:14:2,42
Okay, let's review.


1050
1:14:2,42 --> 1:14:4,792
Kat, not interested;
me, dying to go.


1051
1:14:4,792 --> 1:14:7,42
Do you know what happens at proms?


1052
1:14:7,42 --> 1:14:10,25
Yes, Daddy. We'll dance,
we'll kiss, we'll come home.


1053
1:14:10,25 --> 1:14:12,75
It's not quite the crisis situation
you imagine.


1054
1:14:12,75 --> 1:14:15,417
Kissing, huh?
That's what you think happens?


1055
1:14:15,417 --> 1:14:16,958
Got news for you.


1056
1:14:16,958 --> 1:14:20,917
Kissing isn't what keeps me up to
my elbows in placenta all day long.


1057
1:14:20,917 --> 1:14:24,458
Can we for two seconds ignore the fact
that you're severely unhinged...


1058
1:14:24,458 --> 1:14:26,708
and discuss my need for a night
of teenage normalcy?


1059
1:14:26,708 --> 1:14:29,958
What's normal?
Those damn Dawson's River kids...


1060
1:14:29,958 --> 1:14:32,625
sleeping in each other's beds
and whatnot?


1061
1:14:32,625 --> 1:14:35,333
- Daddy, that is so not-
- Got news for ya.


1062
1:14:35,333 --> 1:14:37,333
I'm down.
I've got the 4-1- 1.


1063
1:14:37,333 --> 1:14:40,125
And you are not going out
and getting jiggy with some boy.


1064
1:14:40,125 --> 1:14:46,917
I don't care how dope his ride is.


1065
1:14:46,917 --> 1:14:51,125
My mama didn't raise no fool.


1066
1:14:51,125 --> 1:14:54,333
Thanks, Bill.


1067
1:14:54,333 --> 1:14:57,25
Ridiculous amounts of love
across this nation worldwide.


1068
1:14:57,25 --> 1:15:0,458
- Believe it.


1069
1:15:0,458 --> 1:15:2,458
This is the true story.


1070
1:15:2,458 --> 1:15:5,5
- The Real World.
- Seattle.


1071
1:15:5,5 --> 1:15:15,458
- Come in.


1072
1:15:15,458 --> 1:15:20,125
Listen, I know-


1073
1:15:20,125 --> 1:15:23,542
I know you hate having to sit at home
because I'm not Suzy High School.


1074
1:15:23,542 --> 1:15:26,625
- Like you care.
- I do care.


1075
1:15:26,625 --> 1:15:29,375
But I'm a firm believer in doing
something for your own reasons...


1076
1:15:29,375 --> 1:15:31,542
and not someone else's.


1077
1:15:31,542 --> 1:15:34,0
Well, I wish I had that luxury.


1078
1:15:34,0 --> 1:15:37,25
You know, I'm the only sophomore
that got asked to go to the prom...


1079
1:15:37,25 --> 1:15:44,333
and I can't go because
you don't feel like it.


1080
1:15:44,333 --> 1:15:47,292
Joey never told you
that we went out, did he?


1081
1:15:47,292 --> 1:15:57,542
- Yeah, okay.
- In ninth, for a month.


1082
1:15:57,542 --> 1:16:2,0
- Why?
- Because he was, like, such a babe.


1083
1:16:2,0 --> 1:16:4,917
- But you hate Joey.
- Now I do.


1084
1:16:4,917 --> 1:16:12,0
So, what happened?


1085
1:16:12,0 --> 1:16:16,125
Oh!
Please tell me you're joking.


1086
1:16:16,125 --> 1:16:20,292
Just once, right after Mom left.


1087
1:16:20,292 --> 1:16:23,208
Everyone was doing it, so...


1088
1:16:23,208 --> 1:16:26,83
I did it.


1089
1:16:26,83 --> 1:16:29,75
Afterwards I told him I didn't want to
any more because I wasn't ready,


1090
1:16:29,75 --> 1:16:33,125
and he got pissed and he dumped me.


1091
1:16:33,125 --> 1:16:37,125
After that I swore I'd never do anything
just because everyone else was doing it.


1092
1:16:37,125 --> 1:16:39,417
And I haven't since,


1093
1:16:39,417 --> 1:16:45,625
with the exception of Bogey's party
and my stunning digestive pyrotechnics.


1094
1:16:45,625 --> 1:16:48,625
How is it possible
that I did not know about this?


1095
1:16:48,625 --> 1:16:51,83
I warned him that if he told anyone,


1096
1:16:51,83 --> 1:16:57,667
the cheerleading squad would find out
how tiny his dick is.


1097
1:16:57,667 --> 1:17:2,292
Okay, so why didn't you tell me?


1098
1:17:2,292 --> 1:17:6,958
I wanted to let you
make up your mind about him.


1099
1:17:6,958 --> 1:17:10,42
Then why did you help Daddy
hold me hostage?


1100
1:17:10,42 --> 1:17:12,917
It's not like I'm stupid enough
to repeat your mistakes.


1101
1:17:12,917 --> 1:17:15,292
I guess I thought I was protecting you.


1102
1:17:15,292 --> 1:17:18,458
By not letting me experience
anything for myself?


1103
1:17:18,458 --> 1:17:20,458
Not all experiences are good, Bianca.


1104
1:17:20,458 --> 1:17:23,25
You can't always trust
the people you want to.


1105
1:17:23,25 --> 1:17:47,75
Well, I guess I'll never know,
will I?


1106
1:17:47,75 --> 1:17:51,167
! The gray celling on the Earth!


1107
1:17:51,167 --> 1:17:53,917
! Well, it lasted for a while!


1108
1:17:53,917 --> 1:17:56,833
! Take my thoughts
for what they're worth!


1109
1:17:56,833 --> 1:17:59,917
! I've been acting like a child!


1110
1:17:59,917 --> 1:18:3,0
! But what else, what else can I do!


1111
1:18:3,0 --> 1:18:11,42
! I said I'm sorry
Yes, I'm sorry!


1112
1:18:11,42 --> 1:18:15,42
Ladies with thinning hair or bald spots,
G.L.H. solves the problem instantly.


1113
1:18:15,42 --> 1:18:17,583
G.L.H. is not a paint or a cover-up.


1114
1:18:17,583 --> 1:18:21,833
It's an amazing powder that clings
to the tiniest hairs on your head.


1115
1:18:21,833 --> 1:18:24,375
It actually builds on itself...


1116
1:18:24,375 --> 1:18:26,542
leaving you with great,
great looking hair.


1117
1:18:26,542 --> 1:18:30,208
- And the G.L.H. hair system
is not expensive.
- interesting.


1118
1:18:30,208 --> 1:18:32,542
Order your G.L.H. hair package now.


1119
1:18:32,542 --> 1:18:35,292
Bye, Dad.
I'm going to the prom.


1120
1:18:35,292 --> 1:18:37,75
- Funny, sweetie.


1121
1:18:37,75 --> 1:18:44,542
- It instantly covers your bald spot
leaving you with great looking hair.


1122
1:18:44,542 --> 1:18:46,833
- What's that?
- A prom dress.


1123
1:18:46,833 --> 1:18:54,208
I seem to be hearing
that word a lot lately.


1124
1:18:54,208 --> 1:18:58,875
- Hi.
- Wow. I, um-


1125
1:18:58,875 --> 1:19:2,75
Wow.


1126
1:19:2,75 --> 1:19:5,792
- Bye, Daddy.
- Stop.


1127
1:19:5,792 --> 1:19:9,875
Turn. Explain.


1128
1:19:9,875 --> 1:19:13,292
Okay. Remember how you said
I could date if Kat dated?


1129
1:19:13,292 --> 1:19:17,333
Well, she found this guy who's
actually kind of perfect for her
which is perfect for me...


1130
1:19:17,333 --> 1:19:20,542
because Cameron asked me to go to
the prom and I really, really wanna go,


1131
1:19:20,542 --> 1:19:24,83
and since Kat went I guess I'm allowed
to based on the aforementioned rule...


1132
1:19:24,83 --> 1:19:26,375
and its previous stipulations,
of course.


1133
1:19:26,375 --> 1:19:32,0
- Nice to meet you.
- Let's go.


1134
1:19:32,0 --> 1:19:37,125
I know every cop in town, bucko!


1135
1:19:37,125 --> 1:19:41,83
This is not good.


1136
1:19:41,83 --> 1:19:45,333
! I said I want you to know!


1137
1:19:45,333 --> 1:19:49,375
! I said I want you
to know right now!


1138
1:19:49,375 --> 1:19:53,42
! Well, I want you to know!


1139
1:19:53,42 --> 1:19:58,625
! I said I want you
to kno-o-o-w!


1140
1:19:58,625 --> 1:20:3,625
! Who-o-o-a!


1141
1:20:3,625 --> 1:20:6,83
! Shout, shout!


1142
1:20:6,83 --> 1:20:8,583
! Shout, shout!


1143
1:20:8,583 --> 1:20:10,583
! Hey-a-a-a!


1144
1:20:10,583 --> 1:20:21,0
! Hey-a-a-a!


1145
1:20:21,0 --> 1:20:23,667
Wow.


1146
1:20:23,667 --> 1:20:27,583
You too.


1147
1:20:27,583 --> 1:20:29,958
Where'd you get a tux
at the last minute?


1148
1:20:29,958 --> 1:20:33,417
Oh, just something I had,
you know, lying around.


1149
1:20:33,417 --> 1:20:40,792
- Where'd you get the dress?
- Oh, just something I had,
you know, lying around.


1150
1:20:40,792 --> 1:20:45,25
Listen, I'm really sorry
that I questioned your motives.


1151
1:20:45,25 --> 1:20:47,25
I was wrong.


1152
1:20:47,25 --> 1:20:53,167
You're forgiven.


1153
1:20:53,167 --> 1:20:55,292
Okay.


1154
1:20:55,292 --> 1:21:11,375
- Ready for the prom?
- Yes, ma'am.


1155
1:21:11,375 --> 1:21:23,0
Hi, Mr Stratford. I'm Joey.
I'm here to pick up Bianca.


1156
1:21:23,0 --> 1:21:25,83
! On their minds!


1157
1:21:25,83 --> 1:21:29,542
! Their hormones are raging
and they want it all the time!


1158
1:21:29,542 --> 1:21:32,292
! And I know
I know 'cause you said so!


1159
1:21:32,292 --> 1:21:36,583
! And I can't just let you go and
I know, I know 'cause you said so!


1160
1:21:36,583 --> 1:21:38,583
- Have you seen him?
- Who?


1161
1:21:38,583 --> 1:21:41,542
William.
He asked me to meet him here.


1162
1:21:41,542 --> 1:21:46,83
Oh, Mandella, please tell me you haven't
progressed to full-on hallucinations.


1163
1:21:46,83 --> 1:21:49,0
! You're last to see
and last to touch!


1164
1:21:49,0 --> 1:21:51,708
! But I would never, ever, ever
treat you wrong!


1165
1:21:51,708 --> 1:21:54,75
! Been waiting for you all day long!


1166
1:21:54,75 --> 1:21:58,708
! And I know, I know 'cause you said so
and I can't just let you go!


1167
1:21:58,708 --> 1:22:8,833
! And I know, I know 'cause you said so
and I can't just let you go!


1168
1:22:8,833 --> 1:22:35,583
- Milady.
- Good sir.


1169
1:22:35,583 --> 1:22:38,958
Oh, my God, it's-


1170
1:22:38,958 --> 1:22:47,125
I called in a favor!


1171
1:22:47,125 --> 1:22:50,875
! Oh, I can't take
another heartache!


1172
1:22:50,875 --> 1:22:55,167
! Though you say you're my friend
I'm at my wit's end!


1173
1:22:55,167 --> 1:22:57,625
! You say your love is bona fide!


1174
1:22:57,625 --> 1:23:2,292
! But that don't coincide
with the things that you do!


1175
1:23:2,292 --> 1:23:6,0
! And when I ask you to be nice!


1176
1:23:6,0 --> 1:23:8,125
! You say you gotta be!


1177
1:23:8,125 --> 1:23:11,625
! Cruel to be kind
in the right measure!


1178
1:23:11,625 --> 1:23:14,625
! Cruel to be kind
It's a very good sign!


1179
1:23:14,625 --> 1:23:20,417
! Cruel to be kind
means that I love you, baby!


1180
1:23:20,417 --> 1:23:22,417
! You gotta be cruel to be kind!


1181
1:23:22,417 --> 1:23:26,958
! Ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-oo!


1182
1:23:26,958 --> 1:23:30,25
! Cruel to be kind
in the right measure!


1183
1:23:30,25 --> 1:23:38,167
! Cruel to be kind
It's a very good sign!


1184
1:23:38,167 --> 1:23:39,917
What are you doing here?


1185
1:23:39,917 --> 1:23:42,625
I know you didn't think
you were the only sophomore at the prom.


1186
1:23:42,625 --> 1:23:44,625
Joey just picked me up.


1187
1:23:44,625 --> 1:23:47,625
Oh, well, congratulations.
He's all yours.


1188
1:23:47,625 --> 1:23:49,208
Very generous, princess.


1189
1:23:49,208 --> 1:23:52,25
And just so you know,
Joey only liked you for one reason.


1190
1:23:52,25 --> 1:23:54,333
He even had a bet going
with his friends.


1191
1:23:54,333 --> 1:24:1,792
He was gonna nail you tonight.


1192
1:24:1,792 --> 1:24:4,25
- Milwaukee.
- What?


1193
1:24:4,25 --> 1:24:7,333
That's where I was last year.
I wasn't in jail.


1194
1:24:7,333 --> 1:24:12,5
I don't know Marilyn Manson and I didn't
sleep with a Spice Girl, I don't think.


1195
1:24:12,5 --> 1:24:16,542
You see, my grandpa, he was ill so
I spent most of the year on his couch...


1196
1:24:16,542 --> 1:24:20,167
watching Wheel of Fortune
and making Spaghettis.


1197
1:24:20,167 --> 1:24:22,417
End of story.


1198
1:24:22,417 --> 1:24:26,208
No way.


1199
1:24:26,208 --> 1:24:30,375
Hey. What's Bianca doing here
with that cheese dick?


1200
1:24:30,375 --> 1:24:37,917
I didn't pay you to take out Kat so some
little punk could snake me with Bianca.


1201
1:24:37,917 --> 1:24:52,458
Nothing in it for you, huh?


1202
1:24:52,458 --> 1:24:54,708
The shit hath hitteth...


1203
1:24:54,708 --> 1:25:0,208
the faneth.


1204
1:25:0,208 --> 1:25:6,792
Joey, pal, compadre?


1205
1:25:6,792 --> 1:25:10,167
You messed with the wrong guy,
and now you're gonna pay.


1206
1:25:10,167 --> 1:25:13,83
You and that little bitch.


1207
1:25:13,83 --> 1:25:18,417
All right, that's enough, okay!
You crossed the line.


1208
1:25:18,417 --> 1:25:26,5
Oh, come on!
Get up, you little punk!


1209
1:25:26,5 --> 1:25:29,75
Shit, Bianca!
I'm shooting a nose spray ad tomorrow!


1210
1:25:29,75 --> 1:25:32,833
That's for making my date bleed!
That's for my sister!


1211
1:25:32,833 --> 1:25:43,625
- And that's for me.


1212
1:25:43,625 --> 1:25:46,42
Are you okay?


1213
1:25:46,42 --> 1:25:56,958
Never been better.


1214
1:25:56,958 --> 1:26:1,292
- Would you give me a chance-
- You were paid to take me out
by the one person I truly hate.


1215
1:26:1,292 --> 1:26:3,292
I knew this was a set-up!


1216
1:26:3,292 --> 1:26:5,292
Kat, it wasn't like that, okay.


1217
1:26:5,292 --> 1:26:8,833
What was it like, a down payment now
and a bonus for sleeping with me?


1218
1:26:8,833 --> 1:26:12,0
No, I didn't care about the money!
I cared-


1219
1:26:12,0 --> 1:26:15,917
I cared about you.


1220
1:26:15,917 --> 1:26:21,583
You are so not who I thought you were.


1221
1:26:21,583 --> 1:26:27,667
! That is how love goes!


1222
1:26:27,667 --> 1:26:32,583
! You will fly
and you will crawl!


1223
1:26:32,583 --> 1:26:41,83
! God knows even angels fall!


1224
1:26:41,83 --> 1:26:43,958
! And it's a secret!


1225
1:26:43,958 --> 1:26:46,417
! That no one tells!


1226
1:26:46,417 --> 1:26:51,333
! One day it's heaven
One day it's hell!


1227
1:26:51,333 --> 1:26:53,833
! And it's no fairy tale!


1228
1:26:53,833 --> 1:26:56,667
! Take it from me!


1229
1:26:56,667 --> 1:27:0,875
! That's the way
it's supposed to be!


1230
1:27:0,875 --> 1:27:3,333
You want?


1231
1:27:3,333 --> 1:27:6,0
Thanks.


1232
1:27:6,0 --> 1:27:10,208
So, you sure you don't want
to go sailing with us? It'll be fun.


1233
1:27:10,208 --> 1:27:13,667
No, I'm fine.


1234
1:27:13,667 --> 1:27:19,83
Look, I don't know if I ever thanked you
for going last night,


1235
1:27:19,83 --> 1:27:23,708
but it really meant a lot to me.


1236
1:27:23,708 --> 1:27:27,208
I'm glad.


1237
1:27:27,208 --> 1:27:29,625
- Hey.
- Hey.


1238
1:27:29,625 --> 1:27:32,875
- You ready?
- Mm-mm.


1239
1:27:32,875 --> 1:27:36,792
- See you later.
- Bye.


1240
1:27:36,792 --> 1:27:46,208
- Is- Is she okay?
- I hope so.


1241
1:27:46,208 --> 1:27:48,292
Where's your sister going?


1242
1:27:48,292 --> 1:27:54,42
She's meeting some bikers,
big ones, full of sperm.


1243
1:27:54,42 --> 1:27:57,0
Funny.


1244
1:27:57,0 --> 1:27:59,75
So, tell me about this dance.
Was it hopping'?


1245
1:27:59,75 --> 1:28:2,5
Parts of it.


1246
1:28:2,5 --> 1:28:4,0
Which parts?


1247
1:28:4,0 --> 1:28:7,333
The part where Bianca
beat the hell out of some guy.


1248
1:28:7,333 --> 1:28:13,0
- Bianca did what?
- What's the matter,
upset that I rubbed off on her?


1249
1:28:13,0 --> 1:28:19,375
No, impressed.


1250
1:28:19,375 --> 1:28:23,708
Fathers don't like to admit it
when their daughters are capable
of running their own lives.


1251
1:28:23,708 --> 1:28:29,167
It means we've become spectators.


1252
1:28:29,167 --> 1:28:34,958
Bianca still lets me play a few innings.
You've had me on the bench for years.


1253
1:28:34,958 --> 1:28:40,917
And when you go to Sarah Lawrence
I won't even be able to watch the game.


1254
1:28:40,917 --> 1:28:44,667
When I go?


1255
1:28:44,667 --> 1:28:48,5
Oh, boy. Don't tell me
you changed your mind.


1256
1:28:48,5 --> 1:29:7,542
I already sent 'em a cheque.


1257
1:29:7,542 --> 1:29:11,125
All right, I assume everyone
has found time to complete their poem,


1258
1:29:11,125 --> 1:29:13,83
except for Mr Donner,


1259
1:29:13,83 --> 1:29:17,583
who has an excuse.


1260
1:29:17,583 --> 1:29:23,458
Shaft, lose the glasses.


1261
1:29:23,458 --> 1:29:34,167
All right, anyone brave enough
to read theirs aloud?


1262
1:29:34,167 --> 1:29:39,42
I will.


1263
1:29:39,42 --> 1:29:49,5
Lord, here we go.


1264
1:29:49,5 --> 1:29:52,917
"I hate the way you talk to me
and the way you cut your hair.


1265
1:29:52,917 --> 1:29:57,375
"I hate the way you drive my car.
I hate it when you stare.


1266
1:29:57,375 --> 1:30:1,333
"I hate your big dumb combat boots
and the way you read my mind.


1267
1:30:1,333 --> 1:30:6,667
"I hate you so much it makes me sick.
It even makes me rhyme.


1268
1:30:6,667 --> 1:30:10,292
"I hate it-
I hate the way you're always right.


1269
1:30:10,292 --> 1:30:12,667
"I hate it when you lie.


1270
1:30:12,667 --> 1:30:18,292
"I hate it when you make me laugh,
even worse when you make me cry.


1271
1:30:18,292 --> 1:30:22,292
"I hate it when you're not around
and the fact that you didn't call.


1272
1:30:22,292 --> 1:30:26,167
"But mostly, I hate the way
I don't hate you, not even close,


1273
1:30:26,167 --> 1:31:11,583
not even a little bit,
not even at all."


1274
1:31:11,583 --> 1:31:15,208
- Nice, huh?
- A Fender Strat?


1275
1:31:15,208 --> 1:31:17,208
Is it for me?


1276
1:31:17,208 --> 1:31:20,875
Yeah, I thought you could use it,
you know, when you start your band.


1277
1:31:20,875 --> 1:31:23,708
Besides,
I had some extra cash, you know.


1278
1:31:23,708 --> 1:31:28,583
Some asshole paid me
to take out this really great girl.


1279
1:31:28,583 --> 1:31:30,583
Is that right?


1280
1:31:30,583 --> 1:31:36,417
Yeah, but I screwed up.
I, um- I fell for her.


1281
1:31:36,417 --> 1:31:38,458
Really?


1282
1:31:38,458 --> 1:31:44,958
It's not everyday you find a girl
who'll flash someone
to get you out of detention.


1283
1:31:44,958 --> 1:31:54,75
Oh, God.


1284
1:31:54,75 --> 1:31:58,833
You can't just buy me a guitar
every time you screw up, you know.


1285
1:31:58,833 --> 1:32:1,333
Yeah, I know.


1286
1:32:1,333 --> 1:32:12,167
But there's always drums and bass
and maybe even one day a tambourine.


1287
1:32:12,167 --> 1:32:14,625
And don't just think you can-


1288
1:32:14,625 --> 1:32:18,417
! I want you to want me!


1289
1:32:18,417 --> 1:32:23,0
! I need you to need me!


1290
1:32:23,0 --> 1:32:27,292
! I'd love you to love me!


1291
1:32:27,292 --> 1:32:32,333
! I'm beggin' you to beg me!


1292
1:32:32,333 --> 1:32:34,708
! Shine up my old brown shoes!


1293
1:32:34,708 --> 1:32:37,0
! I put on a brand-new shirt!


1294
1:32:37,0 --> 1:32:39,0
! I'll get home early from work!


1295
1:32:39,0 --> 1:32:42,667
! If you say that you love me!


1296
1:32:42,667 --> 1:32:46,375
! Didn't I, didn't I
didn't I see you crying'!


1297
1:32:46,375 --> 1:32:51,75
! Oh, didn't I, didn't I
didn't I see you crying'!


1298
1:32:51,75 --> 1:32:53,458
! Feeling' all alone without a friend!


1299
1:32:53,458 --> 1:32:55,542
! You know you feel like dying'!


1300
1:32:55,542 --> 1:33:0,708
! Oh, didn't I, didn't I
didn't I see you crying'!


1301
1:33:0,708 --> 1:33:5,167
! I want you to want me!


1302
1:33:5,167 --> 1:33:9,708
! I need you to need me!


1303
1:33:9,708 --> 1:33:13,917
! I'd love you to love me!


1304
1:33:13,917 --> 1:33:19,42
! I'm begging' you to beg me!


1305
1:33:19,42 --> 1:33:21,375
! Shine up my old brown shoes!


1306
1:33:21,375 --> 1:33:23,708
! I put on a brand-new shirt!


1307
1:33:23,708 --> 1:33:25,708
! I'll get home early from work!


1308
1:33:25,708 --> 1:33:30,5
! If you say that you love me!


1309
1:33:30,5 --> 1:33:34,458
! Didn't I, didn't I
didn't I see you crying'!


1310
1:33:34,458 --> 1:33:39,75
! Oh, didn't I, didn't I
didn't I see you crying'!


1311
1:33:39,75 --> 1:33:43,667
! Feeling' all alone without a friend
you know you feel like dying'!


1312
1:33:43,667 --> 1:33:48,792
! Oh, didn't I, didn't I
didn't I see you crying'!


1313
1:33:48,792 --> 1:33:58,25
Hey!


1314
1:33:58,25 --> 1:34:2,125
! Feeling' all alone without a friend
you know you feel like dying'!


1315
1:34:2,125 --> 1:34:16,542
! Oh, didn't I, didn't I
didn't I see you crying'!


1316
1:34:16,542 --> 1:34:21,0
! I want you to want me!


1317
1:34:21,0 --> 1:34:25,625
! I need you to need me!


1318
1:34:25,625 --> 1:34:29,833
! I'd love you to love me!


1319
1:34:29,833 --> 1:34:35,0
! I'm begging' you to beg me!


1320
1:34:35,0 --> 1:34:39,417
! I want you to want me!


1321
1:34:39,417 --> 1:34:44,917
! I want you to want me!


1322
1:34:44,917 --> 1:34:49,708
No offence. I know everyone "digs"
your sister and all, but, um-


1323
1:34:49,708 --> 1:34:53,417
she's without.


1324
1:34:53,417 --> 1:35:6,833
You know, you're not as vile
as I thought you were.


1325
1:35:6,833 --> 1:35:9,708
You suck.


1326
1:35:9,708 --> 1:35:15,292
Okay. Let's go!


1327
1:35:15,292 --> 1:35:17,417
You're just messing' with me,
aren't you?


1328
1:35:17,417 --> 1:35:20,75
- No, I'm really
looking forward to doing it.
- Go see Miss Perky.


1329
1:35:20,75 --> 1:35:23,542
- What?
- Go. Perky's. Go, now.


1330
1:35:23,542 --> 1:35:26,542
Once again.
"Perky, now" is the second one.


1331
1:35:26,542 --> 1:35:29,292
- Perky's now. Perky's, now.
- Right away.


1332
1:35:29,292 --> 1:35:31,292
- Now, Perky's.
- Hey, hey.


1333
1:35:31,292 --> 1:35:34,375
- Now, Perky's. Perky's now.
- At the beginning of the shot.


1334
1:35:34,375 --> 1:35:39,42
Perk- Oh.


1335
1:35:39,42 --> 1:35:42,583
Bianca, let's go. We're all
congregating around Mr Cuervo.


1336
1:35:42,583 --> 1:35:56,208
Um, I'll see you around, okay?


1337
1:35:56,208 --> 1:35:59,25
Don't worry.
There's better for you...


1338
1:35:59,25 --> 1:36:1,583
and it's right here.


1339
1:36:1,583 --> 1:36:5,625
- Come here.
No, I wanted you for so long.


1340
1:36:5,625 --> 1:36:9,458
You messed with the wrong guy,
and now you're gonna pay.


1341
1:36:9,458 --> 1:36:13,292
You and that little bitch.


1342
1:36:13,292 --> 1:36:21,75
All right, that's enough, okay!
You crossed the line.


1343
1:36:21,75 --> 1:36:29,42
What, are you kidding me?


1344
1:36:29,42 --> 1:36:35,292
- I'm driving, so I pick the tunes.
- And it's my car.


1345
1:36:35,292 --> 1:36:51,25
I want some coffee!


1346
1:36:51,25 --> 1:36:54,292
Could I get a prophylactic?


1347
1:36:54,292 --> 1:36:57,583
A prophylactic.
Ahhhh.


1348
1:36:57,583 --> 1:37:1,417
- Let go!
- How could you set me up like that?


1349
1:37:1,417 --> 1:37:3,375
Oh, God, I just wanted-


1350
1:37:3,375 --> 1:37:6,125
To completely damage me,
send me to therapy forever?


1351
1:37:6,125 --> 1:37:10,792
- Ow! No, I just wanted-
- Ladies.


1352
1:37:10,792 --> 1:37:12,667
- Shall we go to my office?
- Tout de suite!


1353
1:37:12,667 --> 1:37:15,458
Tout de suite!


1354
1:37:15,458 --> 1:39:15,458
Oh, my God!
