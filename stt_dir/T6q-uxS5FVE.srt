1
0:0:6,69 --> 0:0:14,12
You grab that.
We're gonna be doing a classic little dish.


2
0:0:14,12 --> 0:0:16,78
They're called Botham Burgers.
This is from the '80's.


3
0:0:16,78 --> 0:0:18,63
This is what Duran Duran would have eaten.


4
0:0:18,63 --> 0:0:24,45
You wanna make the perfect burger, Chuck steak
is the cut to go because there's a natural


5
0:0:24,45 --> 0:0:27,22
mix of fat and incredibly tasty meat.


6
0:0:27,22 --> 0:0:31,7
I've got some rosemary here. Beef and rosemary
are best friends, just a couple of little sprigs.


7
0:0:31,7 --> 0:0:31,75
 


8
0:0:31,75 --> 0:0:36,539
Jimbo, can you just pass me that Lincolnshire
Poacher. Look at that. Cooked or uncooked,


9
0:0:36,539 --> 0:0:38,5
it's off the chart.


10
0:0:38,5 --> 0:0:44,0
So, I'm just gonna take about 2, 3 ounces.
A little trick, you know, when you're doing


11
0:0:44,0 --> 0:0:49,89
a burger, putting the cheese in there just
seasons it and makes it really delicious as well.


12
0:0:49,89 --> 0:0:54,1
So just scrunch that in Jim. Now the whole
point of a Botham burger is it's a Botham Burger.


13
0:0:54,1 --> 0:0:58,889
My old man's pub was called The Cricketers
and it was next to a cricket pitch and it


14
0:0:58,889 --> 0:1:2,929
was after Ian Botham.
So basically, by doing this recipe we are


15
0:1:2,929 --> 0:1:7,35
admitting that my old man has basically taken
advantage of a celebrity's name.


16
0:1:7,35 --> 0:1:11,39
This is like our dream. I dunno, the last
time we did this we must have been...


17
0:1:11,39 --> 0:1:14,84
We were about 15
Yeah. And camping out and it'd be like a tin


18
0:1:14,84 --> 0:1:18,4
of beans and a backpack and a really crappy
tent.


19
0:1:18,4 --> 0:1:20,48
I know.
Just imagine if our wives could see us right now.


20
0:1:20,48 --> 0:1:23,14
I've told my wife I'm working really hard today.


21
0:1:23,14 --> 0:1:27,71
Normally you put this in a really hot oven
and roast the burger. To create an oven I'm


22
0:1:27,71 --> 0:1:35,39
just gonna put a metal tin over like this
and pour the charcoal on top so we've got


23
0:1:35,39 --> 0:1:38,95
an oven basically, a little mini oven.
And then to go with it, the really important


24
0:1:38,95 --> 0:1:44,78
part to making this work is a salsa.
In sort of New Mexico, L.A, East L.A with


25
0:1:44,78 --> 0:1:49,56
the Mexican communities they just blacken
up peppers, tomatoes, I've got spring onions


26
0:1:49,56 --> 0:1:52,9
in there.
I've got a Scotch Bonnet in there. Make sure


27
0:1:52,9 --> 0:1:54,94
you put a hole in the Scotch Bonnet because
it will explode and then we get covered in


28
0:1:54,94 --> 0:2:0,43
chilli and it's hideous.
And what I'm gonna do is literally just spend


29
0:2:0,43 --> 0:2:6,15
a few minutes just pinching the skins off
and underneath you're left with just hot,


30
0:2:6,15 --> 0:2:12,7
sweet, juicy, lovely tomato.
If there's a few bits of like charred pepper


31
0:2:12,7 --> 0:2:15,9
it doesn't matter at all because that's all
part of the flavour.


32
0:2:15,9 --> 0:2:20,86
I want you to taste that now.
That Scotch Bonnet's hot huh?!


33
0:2:20,86 --> 0:2:23,9
That's hot.
Yeah, right. Now calm down.


34
0:2:23,9 --> 0:2:28,98
If you'd done more of this at school we'd
have had loads more girlfriends.


35
0:2:28,98 --> 0:2:34,86
Yeah I know. But we never could get girlfriends.
I've got some mint here, so our fresh element.


36
0:2:34,86 --> 0:2:38,42
You've tasted that original one, which is
completely unseasoned, now I'm chopping the


37
0:2:38,42 --> 0:2:43,97
mint into it. You could use coriander, you
could use basil, you could go parsley.


38
0:2:43,97 --> 0:2:51,3
A little olive oil in here and I've got lemon
and lime. You want that herb and you want


39
0:2:51,3 --> 0:2:54,68
that citrus to balance the heat of the chilli.
Yeah.


40
0:2:54,68 --> 0:2:57,0
With a bit of meat.
That's gonna be,


41
0:2:57,0 --> 0:2:59,209
Oh that's beautiful.
Amazing.


42
0:2:59,209 --> 0:3:1,319
And that heat now,
Is just,


43
0:3:1,319 --> 0:3:2,8
ooooh, level.


44
0:3:2,8 --> 0:3:4,8
Get rid of that.


45
0:3:4,8 --> 0:3:9,13
Oh yes!
Look at my burgers.


46
0:3:9,13 --> 0:3:12,77
You've just done Botham Burgers.
And I feel that I've been transported back,


47
0:3:12,77 --> 0:3:13,959
to being,
14 again?


48
0:3:13,959 --> 0:3:15,31
Yeah.
Right, dish it up.


49
0:3:15,31 --> 0:3:22,65
Chuck steak, rosemary, Lincolnshire Poacher
cheese just melted in the middle of it, seasoning


50
0:3:22,65 --> 0:3:28,79
every little grain of beautiful meat in there.
And then the grilled salsa. Look at that.


51
0:3:28,79 --> 0:3:31,63
Bad ass!
Jimmy, God bless you.


52
0:3:31,63 --> 0:3:33,92
I've never seen the Botham Burger looking
so posh.


53
0:3:33,92 --> 0:3:39,84
Look at that. Look, that's the cross section,
come on Eileen!


54
0:3:39,84 --> 0:3:48,5
Mmm, this is brilliant. Sitting by the fire,
few beers, Botham Burger.


55
0:3:48,5 --> 0:5:48,5
Great day today Jim.
Yeah, good.
