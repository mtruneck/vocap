###26 THOMAS: Fuck me.
###29 Fuck.
###30 Damn it.
###31 Get in.
###32 [GUNSHOTS]
###40 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###52 THOMAS: For those of us who weren't there, man, the
###55 Vietnam War has always been forbidden territory--
###58 a searing national void whose depths and horror we can never
###61 know outside of grisly Fogerty scored movies and Mark Baker's
###65 "Nam." Even playing Vietnam as kids seemed off limits unless
###70 you did it under the auspices of Rambo.
###73 To full on reenact it would be the ultimate heresy, a slap in
###77 the face of all the vets who died or were captured in the
###80 US military's first defeat, right?
###82 But they do it in North Carolina.
###85 And you know who does it?
###87 Other vets and a bunch of regular reenactors.
###90 I think, uh.
###91 I think we're ready for war.
###92 
###99 Over the last 50 years, war reenactment has gone from
###102 something Elks lodges did on the weekend as an excuse to
###104 get away from their wives, to an obsessive pastime where
###108 hardcore reenactors spend their entire free time
###110 shopping, sewing, and researching to make the
###113 experience as true to life as possible.
###116 As the intensity of the reenactments has grown, the
###118 wars reenacted have raced forward in time, from the old
###121 favorites of the Revolutionary and Civil War, to World War I,
###124 World War II, and every so often Korea.
###127 
###132 Vietnam, however, is tricky.
###133 
###140 For starters there weren't really battles.
###142 Most of the fighting was done on an ad hoc day by day and
###145 night by night basis.
###148 To solve this problem, the reenactors we're with built a
###150 mock firebase out somewhere in the shit, picked an arbitrary
###153 year in the war, and just dedicated themselves to
###156 defending it from Viet Cong assault all night.
###159 Are you still in the service?
###160 RUDY SCHULZ: No, I retired in 2005.
###161 I was in the Army.
###165 I got restarted in reenacting.
###168 I missed the camaraderie.
###171 But once you get out there and you get the feel for it, it's
###173 like, wow these guys were studs.
###175 THOMAS: Even just a little, little taste of it.
###177 RUDY SCHULZ: Just a couple of days.
###178 And these guys were out there for 40 days, 50 days in the
###180 snow, nothing.
###181 And you're like, wow it sucked for two days.
###184 They had to do it for a month.
###187 You know, war sucks.
###188 It's true nobody wants to do it.
###191 THOMAS: Well, except kind of, you guys for fun.
###196 RUDY SCHULZ: It's true.
###196 THOMAS: Well, cool.
###197 Thank you very much.
###197 RUDY SCHULZ: Oh, you're welcome.
###198 THOMAS: Good luck on recon.
###200 
###205 Then there's the issue of finding someone to play the
###207 Vietnamese.
###209 In our case, the reenactors just grabbed a bunch of kids
###211 from the local college and surrounding towns, which is
###214 kind of how Ho Chi Minh did it when you think about it.
###216 
###223 Nice.
###224 This isn't your first reenactment though?
###225 CHRIS EVANS: I've been reenacting
###226 since I was about 15.
###227 THOMAS: Damn.
###228 How did you end up as Charlie on this little foray?
###234 CHRIS EVANS: Well, to put it blank, you can't play Cowboys
###237 and Indians without Indians if you understand my meaning.
###241 You got to have both sides to do something like this, and
###244 we're just more willing to do both sides.
###246 
###249 THOMAS: So you're NVA?
###251 ZACK SEVER: Yes.
###252 THOMAS: Right.
###252 OK Like is there any sort of particular
###255 attraction to Vietnam?
###256 Like does that resonate with you in a particular way?
###258 ZACK SEVER: Yeah.
###259 My great uncle was a First Lieutenant
###262 in a Calvary Division.
###263 THOMAS: OK.
###264 Does he know you're doing this, this weekend?
###266 ZACK SEVER: No.
###266 He doesn't know I'm doing this.
###268 I don't think he'd be very happy if he did.
###270 THOMAS: So I'm supposed to be, basically, a civilian reporter
###273 in [INAUDIBLE].
###274 I guess I'm kind of half-dressed right now.
###276 How am I doing though, so far?
###278 ZACK SEVER: I mean, you're doing pretty good.
###279 The reporters would be out there in the army OD greens
###282 wearing helmets.
###282 They would have a big old PRESS written on and around
###284 their helmet.
###285 THOMAS: That's what I need.
###286 ZACK SEVER: They'd have a--
###287 THOMAS: Instead of a goth band from the '80s button.
###290 ZACK SEVER: Yeah.
###290 THOMAS: Hey, thank you so much man.
###291 ZACK SEVER: Yeah.
###291 No problem.
###293 THOMAS: Happy hunting today.
###294 ZACK SEVER: Thank you.
###295 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###302 THOMAS: All right.
###302 Tape rolling.
###306 Good morning, Vietnam.
###308 We are outside a firebase.
###312 The men you see milling behind me are
###314 members of the 89th Infantry.
###316 I don't know if the rest of this unit has gotten up and
###320 gotten dressed.
###320 It feels like they're taking a collegiate Saturday approach
###323 to this war.
###325 We've seen formations of VC, irregular troops moving
###330 through that sort of area towards our, I'm thinking
###333 that's the, north east.
###336 It is pouring rain which is great for the realism but
###342 sucks for, I guess, the reality.
###346 Perfect weather to absorb the misery that is
###348 this ongoing war.
###351 Happy [INAUDIBLE]
###352 1968.
###355 -Yeah, we're going.
###356 -Just skirting it.
###357 -No, we're going in.
###358 [INAUDIBLE]
###359 -Should be roughly silent movement with all the rain.
###363 Whenever you're ready.
###365 -This guy right here, Mooch, he'll be the last guy.
###368 Give us about five yards.
###370 THOMAS: So five behind Mooch is going to be our maximum.
###375 Since there's no predetermined outcome, unlike traditional
###377 reenactments, this means America could win the battle
###380 or maybe even the war.
###383 [GUNSHOTS]
###386 THOMAS: The first thing we learned about war reenactment
###388 is that it's fucking terrifying having guns fired,
###391 even ones loaded with blanks.
###393 [GUNSHOTS]
###397 THOMAS: The second thing we learned was a common
###399 reenactor's dilemma called the GI effect, which is basically
###403 that people playing Americans don't like to die so sometimes
###406 they just don't.
###408 
###424 DON WHITE: Most everybody out here is an amateur military
###426 historian and that's the main reason we do this hobby.
###430 About half of my reenacting group are actually military
###433 veterans or active duty.
###436 SGT. WILSON: The real soldiers, sailor, airmen,
###439 Marines, they all go through horrible hardships to protect
###444 this country.
###445 We want to make sure that when we're out here and we're doing
###448 these reenactments, that we're not doing a
###451 disservice to them.
###454 THOMAS: The realism of the combat makes it even more
###455 psychologically intriguing that ex-combatants would
###458 submit themselves to this guaranteed flashback trigger.
###460 
###465 Does anybody ever have any problems with it?
###467 Like having come from combat basically going
###469 into simulated combat?
###471 
###473 DON WHITE: We have some guys once in a while
###475 that have some problems.
###478 I'd say it's about 40% of them.
###479 Their first event back they'll actually go sit in the camp
###482 for that event or have some issues with the--
###486 THOMAS: Yeah, it'll take them time to acclimate to that.
###489 
###495 SGT. WILSON: The horror and the terror is just shards of a
###497 veteran's experience in the military.
###500 And if we can focus on the positive aspects as well as
###503 the hardships, the veterans, they really appreciate that
###506 and they really like that.
###508 
###511 THOMAS: We've been asked along, actually, by this recon
###514 unit made up of Special Forces guys that are going back out
###517 into the woods trying to flush out the dudes who are lighting
###520 up the firebase.
###522 
###529 [GUNSHOTS]
###534 They are lighting this fucking forest up.
###537 -[SPEAKING VIETNAMESE]
###541 -VC eat shit.
###544 -They're wiped out.
###545 
###548 Pizza.
###548 -All right then.
###549 Let me go.
###550 Let me grab a quick [INAUDIBLE]
###552 just so that they understand.
###553 
###556 THOMAS: This is a part of the war you don't very often get
###558 to see, and that's--
###560 
###563 Oh, no, no.
###564 This is--
###565 
###571 Right.
###571 No, no, no.
###572 We understand that.
###573 You obviously get breaks and things.
###575 We'll head back and hopefully not see you again.
###579 CHRIS EVANS: You'll see us again as soon as we
###580 get our guys back.
###582 THOMAS: All right As night fell, we snuck away from the
###589 American unit we were embedded with and fell in with a bunch
###592 of VC and NVA regulars who were planning a nocturnal raid
###595 on the firebase.
###597 -When we were young, we'd do like little pranks, right?
###599 So we'd phone up a Chinese restaurant, we go, do you have
###602 one young guy?
###604 And literally this guy said, he looks,
###606 I'll look in the menu.
###607 He looks in the menu.
###607 He goes, no, we don't have one young guy.
###609 And I said, well, do you have an old one then?
###611 And hang up the phone.
###613 -One young guy?
###614 -One young guy.
###616 -Oh, jeez.
###620 THOMAS: Just a bunch of VC hanging out in a tobacco
###622 field, teaching each other how [INAUDIBLE].
###625 I mean, it's not a rice paddy but whatever,
###626 you're in North Carolina.
###628 -This is your team.
###628 Anybody with a red scarf, you're NVA.
###632 If you get killed, stay there.
###634 The Americans are going to check you, search you, then
###636 they're going to leave you, OK?
###638 After they check you.
###640 Girls--
###641 they know that you all are girls, don't worry about it.
###643 
###646 THOMAS: It begins.
###647 
###652 -Come on you fucking gook.
###653 
###656 THOMAS: Charlie's fucking everywhere.
###659 Our firebase is under attack.
###662 -Cut the camera off.
###665 [GUNSHOTS]
###667 -Next.
###668 THOMAS: So we just witnessed a war crime.
###670
