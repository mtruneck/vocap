###20 LUCY: Hi, I'm Lucy.
###22 This is Misty Meadow Farm in Kent.
###24 Let me show you our ponies.
###25 
###29 This is Olivia.
###31 She's nine years old.
###32 She's my best friend really.
###34 She's really sweet.
###36 But she's very quiet.
###38 Olivia's favorite food is probably things
###39 like carrots, apples.
###42 But she is actually on a restricted diet.
###44 She has a mask that she wears when she goes
###47 out during the day.
###48 Because she'll just pig.
###49 
###54 INTERVIEWER: Why do you like Shetland ponies?
###57 LUCY: Their size.
###58 They're very cute, and they're very friendly.
###61 Ah, she's with the dog.
###64 
###72 Shetlands tend to be a very piggy breed of pony.
###75 And we do things like jumping with her to help her basically
###77 keep the weight off.
###79 
###85 Good girl.
###86 
###89 This is Olivia's passport.
###91 All ponies basically have to have a passport which will
###94 record any injections that they've ever had.
###97 And also it will show their family tree, so that when you
###100 buy them you know where they've come from, what their
###102 background is.
###103 Olivia's father is called Toy House Mousie
###106 Prince John of Lancaster.
###109 And her mother is called Copperfield's Betty Boop.
###112 
###122 She's friends with a lot of ponies in her field.
###125 She probably has a special mate that she hangs out with.
###127 They tend to, like, have a best friend each.
###129 
###135 This here is Julianne.
###138 She's pretty much, I would say, one of the naughtiest
###141 ones that we've got here.
###142 And she's actually wearing a muzzle.
###143 Because she's got a lot of weight on her at the moment.
###147 And the best way to keep it off is to have this muzzle
###151 thing on her.
###151 But it's actually the first day she's worn it.
###153 And she hates it.
###155 We've had a bit of an issue with the fencing over there
###158 which we've sort of had to put up a
###159 makeshift sort of barricade.
###161 Well basically we turned up one day and found that Olivia
###165 and Julianne had got in there.
###168 And they were scrumping away on all the apples.
###170 Some Shetland ponies actually don't care
###172 about electric fencing.
###173 And they are happy to take the shock, basically, just to get
###175 to the grass that's on the other side of the fence.
###177 
###182 So the darker colored pony that's closest
###185 to us at the moment--
###186 she's called Tia.
###187 And her little foal is called Morgan.
###190 He's a boy.
###190 He's only a week old.
###192 And then the other one over there-- she's called Holly.
###195 That's her daughter, who was also born last
###197 week, called Hannah.
###198 
###208 Yeah, they're so fluffy at this age--
###210 
###215 fluffy and tiny.
###216 
###226 INTERVIEWER: Would you say that you're quite
###227 good friends now?
###228 LUCY: Yeah, yeah, she is.
###229 She's my little girl.
###230 She's my little pony.
###232 I love her.
###233
