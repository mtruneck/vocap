2
0:0:24,1 --> 0:0:26,266
JAKE BURGHART: Starting to have
a bit of a breakdown.


3
0:0:26,266 --> 0:0:27,69
Let's see.


4
0:0:27,69 --> 0:0:31,26
I'm going to take this tape out,
put it in my pocket after


5
0:0:31,26 --> 0:0:33,486
I shoot it, and--


6
0:0:33,486 --> 0:0:35,454
I don't even know why I'm
shooting it right now.


7
0:0:35,454 --> 0:0:38,898
It's sort of a--


8
0:0:38,898 --> 0:0:42,342
I just kind of really need
someone to talk to.


9
0:0:42,342 --> 0:0:44,82
I don't know where to start.


10
0:0:44,82 --> 0:0:46,81
I came into this trip with a--


11
0:0:46,81 --> 0:0:48,0
really excited about it.


12
0:0:48,0 --> 0:0:50,28
Just nothing more than
getting to be on the


13
0:0:50,28 --> 0:0:52,2
ocean for three weeks.


14
0:0:52,2 --> 0:0:55,41
Now I don't have any idea
what's going on.


15
0:0:55,41 --> 0:0:56,99
I can't sleep at night.


16
0:0:56,99 --> 0:1:2,47
I'm, like, feeling sick, feeling
really sort of trapped


17
0:1:2,47 --> 0:1:3,75
on this boat.


18
0:1:3,75 --> 0:1:4,4
There's nowhere to go.


19
0:1:4,4 --> 0:1:6,12
It's a 50-foot boat, you know?


20
0:1:6,12 --> 0:1:8,631
It's like, if you want to take
a walk around the block, it


21
0:1:8,631 --> 0:1:10,11
doesn't happen.


22
0:1:10,11 --> 0:1:14,31
You want to like run or do
anything to sort of forget


23
0:1:14,31 --> 0:1:16,8
about what's going on, and
it's just not there.


24
0:1:16,8 --> 0:1:20,15
We're all here, all
on this boat.


25
0:1:20,15 --> 0:1:21,58
There's no getting away
from each other.


26
0:1:21,58 --> 0:1:24,58



27
0:1:24,58 --> 0:1:27,62
We have two watches a day, and
I don't think I've slept in


28
0:1:27,62 --> 0:1:28,87
three days.


29
0:1:28,87 --> 0:1:35,95



30
0:1:35,95 --> 0:1:40,6
This is my first time I've ever
gone night diving, or


31
0:1:40,6 --> 0:1:47,435
diving in the ocean, or diving
this far away from anything,


32
0:1:47,435 --> 0:1:52,861
or diving with a camera, or
diving with a knife, or diving


33
0:1:52,861 --> 0:1:54,111
with a captain.


34
0:1:54,111 --> 0:1:57,48



35
0:1:57,48 --> 0:1:59,58
MEREDITH DANLUCK: It was like
going into outer space.


36
0:1:59,58 --> 0:2:7,232



37
0:2:7,232 --> 0:2:13,15
Like, the point of something
being so crazy and scary that


38
0:2:13,15 --> 0:2:15,58
it's really fun.


39
0:2:15,58 --> 0:2:34,405
[LAUGHING]


40
0:2:34,405 --> 0:2:35,91
THOMAS MORTON: Jake and
Meredith are under


41
0:2:35,91 --> 0:2:37,73
the boat right now.


42
0:2:37,73 --> 0:2:42,5
I'm still on watch, apparently,
which I guess was


43
0:2:42,5 --> 0:2:45,61
never factored into
the schedule.


44
0:2:45,61 --> 0:2:49,55
I puked pretty ferociously at
around eight or so, and then


45
0:2:49,55 --> 0:2:55,0
had kind of a long drying off
spell where I probably would


46
0:2:55,0 --> 0:2:58,72
have preferred to get a
little bit of sleep.


47
0:2:58,72 --> 0:2:59,97
JAKE BURGHART: That
was pretty insane.


48
0:2:59,97 --> 0:3:2,785



49
0:3:2,785 --> 0:3:4,757
[LAUGHING]


50
0:3:4,757 --> 0:3:5,25
CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE:
All right.


51
0:3:5,25 --> 0:3:7,5
This was quite a
wonderful test.


52
0:3:7,5 --> 0:3:8,43
I'm quite pleased.


53
0:3:8,43 --> 0:3:11,725
The creatures you saw tonight
will pale by comparison.


54
0:3:11,725 --> 0:3:15,83



55
0:3:15,83 --> 0:3:19,63
THOMAS MORTON: So watch
just ended.


56
0:3:19,63 --> 0:3:24,71
It gets really, really boring
up there with absolutely


57
0:3:24,71 --> 0:3:26,4
nothing going on.


58
0:3:26,4 --> 0:3:31,254
So I'm going to make my own
little log entry here, and


59
0:3:31,254 --> 0:3:35,11
then call it a night.


60
0:3:35,11 --> 0:3:38,98
Good luck with your watch.


61
0:3:38,98 --> 0:3:42,16
JAKE BURGHART: So once every
hour, we have to do the log


62
0:3:42,16 --> 0:3:44,59
and check the engine rooms to
make sure that they're not


63
0:3:44,59 --> 0:3:46,712
flooded with water.


64
0:3:46,712 --> 0:3:48,7
Before you know it, it's 3:00.


65
0:3:48,7 --> 0:3:50,67
It's time for your second
log and engine check.


66
0:3:50,67 --> 0:3:54,51
From there it gets
really slow.


67
0:3:54,51 --> 0:3:59,55
This made us all kind of start
doing really nerdy things.


68
0:3:59,55 --> 0:4:1,32
I'm wearing a turtleneck and
learning about the stars.


69
0:4:1,32 --> 0:4:10,997



70
0:4:10,997 --> 0:4:13,961
Oh shit, I think I just
deleted the course.


71
0:4:13,961 --> 0:4:15,344
MEREDITH DANLUCK: What?


72
0:4:15,344 --> 0:4:17,53
JAKE BURGHART: I think I just
deleted the whole course.


73
0:4:17,53 --> 0:4:18,169
I was just--


74
0:4:18,169 --> 0:4:21,27
I was just clicking on these
things, and I don't know.


75
0:4:21,27 --> 0:4:22,726
The whole course disappeared.


76
0:4:22,726 --> 0:4:23,662
There's no Undo.


77
0:4:23,662 --> 0:4:26,428
This program is stupid.


78
0:4:26,428 --> 0:4:28,424
Fuck.


79
0:4:28,424 --> 0:4:30,42
Goddamn it.


80
0:4:30,42 --> 0:4:31,917
Captain, we're going
off course.


81
0:4:31,917 --> 0:4:35,41



82
0:4:35,41 --> 0:4:40,309
We're dropping below 190.


83
0:4:40,309 --> 0:4:44,285
MEREDITH DANLUCK: [LAUGHING]


84
0:4:44,285 --> 0:4:48,261
THOMAS MORTON: No, you shouldn't
have done that.


85
0:4:48,261 --> 0:4:54,225
You should have put a sad
face there, perhaps.


86
0:4:54,225 --> 0:5:34,54



87
0:5:34,54 --> 0:5:37,34
So it is day five.


88
0:5:37,34 --> 0:5:42,51
I'm on watch with Joe now,
and we are working out.


89
0:5:42,51 --> 0:5:46,26
That's right, keep
our strength up.


90
0:5:46,26 --> 0:5:52,0
Kind of realized this, uh,
this boat's almost like--


91
0:5:52,0 --> 0:5:54,17
it's like being in prison
but without, like--


92
0:5:54,17 --> 0:5:56,153
I don't know-- like the
punishment and the


93
0:5:56,153 --> 0:5:58,12
gang rape and all.


94
0:5:58,12 --> 0:6:0,56
You don't have shit to do.


95
0:6:0,56 --> 0:6:3,346
You can either read, or
as we decided, you


96
0:6:3,346 --> 0:6:5,32
can try to work out.


97
0:6:5,32 --> 0:6:6,7
Shit, fuck.


98
0:6:6,7 --> 0:6:7,1
Here they come.


99
0:6:7,1 --> 0:6:8,12
Oh, man.


100
0:6:8,12 --> 0:6:9,37
This is fucking exciting.


101
0:6:9,37 --> 0:6:11,8



102
0:6:11,8 --> 0:6:14,32
Dolphins.


103
0:6:14,32 --> 0:6:14,465
[SINGING]


104
0:6:14,465 --> 0:6:16,53
Dolphin party, USA.


105
0:6:16,53 --> 0:6:19,98
Dolphin party, coming here
to play with dolphins.


106
0:6:19,98 --> 0:6:22,29
Jesus Christ, there's,
like, 20.


107
0:6:22,29 --> 0:6:23,68
They're still coming
from the distance.


108
0:6:23,68 --> 0:6:25,29
[LAUGHING]


109
0:6:25,29 --> 0:6:26,94
There are so many fucking
dolphins.


110
0:6:26,94 --> 0:6:30,112



111
0:6:30,112 --> 0:6:32,4
Dude.


112
0:6:32,4 --> 0:6:32,86
This is great.


113
0:6:32,86 --> 0:6:34,71
You get so bored out here.


114
0:6:34,71 --> 0:6:36,55
And then all of a sudden,
you got fucking


115
0:6:36,55 --> 0:6:37,75
dolphins and trash.


116
0:6:37,75 --> 0:6:39,63
It's amazing.


117
0:6:39,63 --> 0:6:42,3
Like, this is the highlight
of our day.


118
0:6:42,3 --> 0:6:44,6
It's kind of getting
ominous out here.


119
0:6:44,6 --> 0:6:46,59
For the past, like, two or three
days, we've been kind of


120
0:6:46,59 --> 0:6:48,76
occasionally seeing shit and
kind of picking and choosing


121
0:6:48,76 --> 0:6:50,61
what we want to pull out.


122
0:6:50,61 --> 0:6:54,1
I'm still holding out hope for,
like, half a kewpie doll


123
0:6:54,1 --> 0:6:59,25
with, like, a fish coming
out of its other arm.


124
0:6:59,25 --> 0:7:0,989
MEREDITH DANLUCK: Hey,
what's going on?


125
0:7:0,989 --> 0:7:4,917



126
0:7:4,917 --> 0:7:6,167
JAKE BURGHART: Probably kelp.


127
0:7:6,167 --> 0:7:15,719



128
0:7:15,719 --> 0:7:17,58
JOE: Good show then, mate.


129
0:7:17,58 --> 0:7:20,31
You see the other two
that came close?


130
0:7:20,31 --> 0:7:22,13
Right there, look at that.


131
0:7:22,13 --> 0:7:23,54
THOMAS MORTON: So what
are you doing there?


132
0:7:23,54 --> 0:7:25,72
Are you severing its gills?


133
0:7:25,72 --> 0:7:26,63
JOE: Yes, its gill.


134
0:7:26,63 --> 0:7:27,51
It's a gill artery.


135
0:7:27,51 --> 0:7:28,5
THOMAS MORTON: OK, yeah.


136
0:7:28,5 --> 0:7:33,86
So you're cutting that so it'll
bleed out the right way.


137
0:7:33,86 --> 0:7:35,92
I'm kind of glad I was
on watch for that.


138
0:7:35,92 --> 0:7:38,67
I'm not too squeamish, but I
just don't like fish when


139
0:7:38,67 --> 0:7:40,104
they're put together.


140
0:7:40,104 --> 0:7:44,87
So it's kind of a double doozy
when they're coming apart, or


141
0:7:44,87 --> 0:7:47,274
when you're taking them apart.


142
0:7:47,274 --> 0:7:50,9
[LAUGHING NERVOUSLY]


143
0:7:50,9 --> 0:7:52,796
He was saying we're safer to
eat smaller fish, even when


144
0:7:52,796 --> 0:7:54,29
we're out towards the gyre.


145
0:7:54,29 --> 0:7:57,246
They've had less time to
accumulate all the toxins in


146
0:7:57,246 --> 0:7:58,496
their system, so--


147
0:7:58,496 --> 0:8:7,75



148
0:8:7,75 --> 0:8:9,855
I feel kind of bad that we've
been eating fish that have


149
0:8:9,855 --> 0:8:12,27
been swimming in this
fucking water.


150
0:8:12,27 --> 0:8:14,8
I don't even want to
think of all the--


151
0:8:14,8 --> 0:8:15,94
just looking at the
big particles--


152
0:8:15,94 --> 0:8:18,55
all the shit we're probably
ingesting.


153
0:8:18,55 --> 0:8:20,57
But at this point, I'm
sure it's too late.


154
0:8:20,57 --> 0:8:22,662
CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE: These
compounds are lypophilic,


155
0:8:22,662 --> 0:8:24,82
meaning fat loving.


156
0:8:24,82 --> 0:8:26,52
So they stick in fat.


157
0:8:26,52 --> 0:8:31,56
A million plankton, a thousand
sardines, a hundred mackerel,


158
0:8:31,56 --> 0:8:35,27
eaten by, say, a mahi-mahi
or a tuna.


159
0:8:35,27 --> 0:8:40,32
And then the higher cetaceans,
they accumulate this whole


160
0:8:40,32 --> 0:8:45,0
chain of accumulation
of these chemicals.


161
0:8:45,0 --> 0:8:48,7
Polycarbonate has Bisphenol-A in
it, which leaches into the


162
0:8:48,7 --> 0:8:50,85
water and can cause
reproductive


163
0:8:50,85 --> 0:8:53,44
harm and other defects.


164
0:8:53,44 --> 0:8:56,68
For instance, one out of four
male swordfish in the


165
0:8:56,68 --> 0:8:59,376
Mediterranean are producing
female egg yolk hormone that


166
0:8:59,376 --> 0:9:1,41
you wouldn't expect a
male fish to make.


167
0:9:1,41 --> 0:9:3,45
THOMAS MORTON: It's screwing
with their genetics.


168
0:9:3,45 --> 0:9:4,74
CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE: It's
screwing with their genetics.


169
0:9:4,74 --> 0:9:8,727
So that's an indication of
disruption of the hormone


170
0:9:8,727 --> 0:9:11,86
system, probably caused by
industrial chemicals.


171
0:9:11,86 --> 0:9:15,33
I mean, we're starting to see
problems like when we talk


172
0:9:15,33 --> 0:9:18,45
about how the Eskimo women
have toxic milk for their


173
0:9:18,45 --> 0:9:21,395
babies and are being asked to
use formula instead to feed


174
0:9:21,395 --> 0:9:21,933
their babies.


175
0:9:21,933 --> 0:9:22,81
THOMAS MORTON: Are
they particularly


176
0:9:22,81 --> 0:9:23,813
susceptible to them?


177
0:9:23,813 --> 0:9:25,34
CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE: Yeah,
because they eat high off the


178
0:9:25,34 --> 0:9:25,98
food chain.


179
0:9:25,98 --> 0:9:30,83
They eat marine mammals that
have high fat content when


180
0:9:30,83 --> 0:9:33,681
this stuff is stored
in the fat.


181
0:9:33,681 --> 0:9:38,26
And they're producing fewer
males and smaller males.


182
0:9:38,26 --> 0:9:42,2
It's conceivable that there
could be population crashes in


183
0:9:42,2 --> 0:9:45,665
many sexually reproducing
species that loses its males.


184
0:9:45,665 --> 0:9:52,405



185
0:9:52,405 --> 0:9:54,88
JAKE BURGHART: Was that
your first swim?


186
0:9:54,88 --> 0:9:57,74
THOMAS MORTON: Ever,
in the ocean.


187
0:9:57,74 --> 0:10:0,1
It's as terrifying as
I fucking thought.


188
0:10:0,1 --> 0:10:12,4



189
0:10:12,4 --> 0:10:14,99
MEREDITH DANLUCK: What?


190
0:10:14,99 --> 0:10:16,77
THOMAS MORTON: Getting out of
the water, there was a little


191
0:10:16,77 --> 0:10:21,17
chunk of, like, yellow debris
that was kind of caught on the


192
0:10:21,17 --> 0:10:22,17
corner of my lip.


193
0:10:22,17 --> 0:10:24,55
And then later, Jake got out
of the water, and it just


194
0:10:24,55 --> 0:10:27,84
like-- it looked like he had
body glitter on part of him.


195
0:10:27,84 --> 0:10:31,472
There was just little
particulate waste.


196
0:10:31,472 --> 0:10:34,38
I've been like eating shit with
my hands all day, too.


197
0:10:34,38 --> 0:10:37,41
There's fucking plastic
in my mouth.


198
0:10:37,41 --> 0:10:41,72
I guess I can properly empathize
with the fish and


199
0:10:41,72 --> 0:10:42,97
filter feeders now.


200
0:10:42,97 --> 0:10:46,75
But still, that's
fucking gross.


201
0:10:46,75 --> 0:10:50,2
I was in the water for all of,
like, 10 minutes with a


202
0:10:50,2 --> 0:10:50,92
snorkel in my mouth.


203
0:10:50,92 --> 0:10:53,532
And somehow a piece of plastic
fucking worked its way in.


204
0:10:53,532 --> 0:11:16,94



205
0:11:16,94 --> 0:11:19,882
I don't think we ever showed--


206
0:11:19,882 --> 0:11:22,83
we ever did a little
tour of the boat.


207
0:11:22,83 --> 0:11:26,87
This is where all of us
have pissed and shit.


208
0:11:26,87 --> 0:11:34,11
What happens when you use
it is it is empty.


209
0:11:34,11 --> 0:11:36,994
It's basically, you fill it up
with water, or if you're


210
0:11:36,994 --> 0:11:39,23
peeing, you just fill
it with that.


211
0:11:39,23 --> 0:11:42,54
And then you stand here
with your face about--


212
0:11:42,54 --> 0:11:43,95
what, a foot and a half--


213
0:11:43,95 --> 0:11:45,93
from your own fucking
excrement.


214
0:11:45,93 --> 0:11:49,6
The best part is when the boat's
rocking and things


215
0:11:49,6 --> 0:11:52,6
start to slosh around.


216
0:11:52,6 --> 0:11:53,31
This is also our shower, too.


217
0:11:53,31 --> 0:11:56,66



218
0:11:56,66 --> 0:11:59,655
A lot of stuff gets
done in this room.


219
0:11:59,655 --> 0:12:0,75
I don't know.


220
0:12:0,75 --> 0:12:4,19
There's been so much of that,
like, this isn't cool to you,


221
0:12:4,19 --> 0:12:6,25
but I've been in a boat
for seven days.


222
0:12:6,25 --> 0:12:8,78
And it's really neat that
we can see a bird.


223
0:12:8,78 --> 0:12:12,4
MEREDITH DANLUCK: [LAUGHING]


224
0:12:12,4 --> 0:12:13,92
THOMAS MORTON: The days
just kind of melt into


225
0:12:13,92 --> 0:12:14,36
the nights and shit.


226
0:12:14,36 --> 0:12:17,89
And it's just kind of like one
big long hunk of walking


227
0:12:17,89 --> 0:12:19,97
around a boat and doing stuff.


228
0:12:19,97 --> 0:12:20,4
I don't know.


229
0:12:20,4 --> 0:12:23,985
It sounds like I'm retarded, but
I've just never looked at


230
0:12:23,985 --> 0:12:26,188
the sky so much out
of pure boredom.


231
0:12:26,188 --> 0:12:28,2
MEREDITH DANLUCK: [LAUGHING]


232
0:12:28,2 --> 0:12:29,72
Trash at starboard.


233
0:12:29,72 --> 0:12:31,22
You got it?


234
0:12:31,22 --> 0:12:33,93
That's good trash.


235
0:12:33,93 --> 0:12:36,35
What is it?


236
0:12:36,35 --> 0:12:38,12
Piece of something?


237
0:12:38,12 --> 0:12:40,16
MEREDITH DANLUCK: Looks
like a flowerpot.


238
0:12:40,16 --> 0:12:41,66
JAKE BURGHART: There's a
really big problem with


239
0:12:41,66 --> 0:12:45,742
flowerpots in the Pacific
Ocean right now.


240
0:12:45,742 --> 0:12:49,43
So stop throwing them in here.


241
0:12:49,43 --> 0:12:51,62
THOMAS MORTON: Garbage island is
less a physical place than


242
0:12:51,62 --> 0:12:54,0
really a state of mind.


243
0:12:54,0 --> 0:12:57,22
At some point, we all find our
garbage island, whether it's


244
0:12:57,22 --> 0:13:1,87
out here in the Pacific or at
home, comfortable, surrounded


245
0:13:1,87 --> 0:13:5,24
by people you care about and
enjoy interacting with on a


246
0:13:5,24 --> 0:13:6,9
regular basis.


247
0:13:6,9 --> 0:13:8,48
CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE:
I showed you--


248
0:13:8,48 --> 0:13:10,91
stop, stop, stop.


249
0:13:10,91 --> 0:13:11,54
JOE: Charlie.


250
0:13:11,54 --> 0:13:12,35
CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE: I
gave you an example--


251
0:13:12,35 --> 0:13:12,62
JOE: Charlie.


252
0:13:12,62 --> 0:13:12,89
Charlie.


253
0:13:12,89 --> 0:13:12,91
Charlie.


254
0:13:12,91 --> 0:13:14,48
CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE: And
you totally ignored it.


255
0:13:14,48 --> 0:13:14,74
JOE: Charlie.


256
0:13:14,74 --> 0:13:15,0
Charlie.


257
0:13:15,0 --> 0:13:15,24
Charlie.


258
0:13:15,24 --> 0:13:16,48
CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE: Don't
tell me Charlie, Charlie,


259
0:13:16,48 --> 0:13:17,235
Charlie, Charlie.


260
0:13:17,235 --> 0:13:20,25
Then Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe.


261
0:13:20,25 --> 0:13:21,905
Joe, it's-- look,
it's so easy--


262
0:13:21,905 --> 0:13:22,65
JOE: Hey, hey, hey, hey.


263
0:13:22,65 --> 0:13:23,71
CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE:
Hey, you're making


264
0:13:23,71 --> 0:13:24,645
more trouble for yourself.


265
0:13:24,645 --> 0:13:26,815
You're cutting it smaller
than it has to be.


266
0:13:26,815 --> 0:13:28,48
JOE: Hey, respect, Charlie.


267
0:13:28,48 --> 0:13:29,84
I've respected you.


268
0:13:29,84 --> 0:13:31,36
You need to respect me.


269
0:13:31,36 --> 0:13:33,4
CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE: Respect
the way you're doing it wrong?


270
0:13:33,4 --> 0:13:34,52
JOE: If this isn't done
right, then say


271
0:13:34,52 --> 0:13:35,595
something at the start.


272
0:13:35,595 --> 0:13:36,2
CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE: That's
what I'm saying.


273
0:13:36,2 --> 0:13:37,74
JOE: You looked at me two
minutes ago, and I


274
0:13:37,74 --> 0:13:38,4
was doing it fine.


275
0:13:38,4 --> 0:13:39,0
CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE:
No, I didn't--


276
0:13:39,0 --> 0:13:40,63
JOE: No, you need
to have respect.


277
0:13:40,63 --> 0:13:42,59
I'm respecting you as a man.


278
0:13:42,59 --> 0:13:42,75
CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE:
[LAUGHING]


279
0:13:42,75 --> 0:13:45,31
JOE: Respect me, or we'll
have further words.


280
0:13:45,31 --> 0:13:46,67
Do we understand ourselves?


281
0:13:46,67 --> 0:13:47,86
CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE:
OK, I'm sorry.


282
0:13:47,86 --> 0:13:48,9
JOE: Thank you.


283
0:13:48,9 --> 0:13:49,98
Now how would you like it?


284
0:13:49,98 --> 0:13:50,47
CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE:
Like this.


285
0:13:50,47 --> 0:13:50,96
Bigger.


286
0:13:50,96 --> 0:13:52,37
THOMAS MORTON: Want to
go catch the sunset?


287
0:13:52,37 --> 0:13:55,99



288
0:13:55,99 --> 0:13:56,95
Oh, my god.


289
0:13:56,95 --> 0:14:1,36
I am totally having a
"Joe-berdose" as of today.


290
0:14:1,36 --> 0:14:4,53
I'm kind of lightening back
up to it-- to the humor--


291
0:14:4,53 --> 0:14:6,77
the humor that is Joe.


292
0:14:6,77 --> 0:14:7,6
I don't know.


293
0:14:7,6 --> 0:14:8,85
I was having a bad--


294
0:14:8,85 --> 0:14:10,88
a bad time with it today.


295
0:14:10,88 --> 0:14:13,0
Just like, being around
a guy who's living


296
0:14:13,0 --> 0:14:14,705
through the riff Holocaust.


297
0:14:14,705 --> 0:14:17,6
I've heard every statement


298
0:14:17,6 --> 0:14:18,47
I've made, basically--


299
0:14:18,47 --> 0:14:21,45
I wouldn't even limit
it to jokes--


300
0:14:21,45 --> 0:14:23,16
repeated back to me.


301
0:14:23,16 --> 0:14:28,36
The one thing I will never grow
tired of is his politics.


302
0:14:28,36 --> 0:14:30,61
He's one of those real just


303
0:14:30,61 --> 0:14:34,65
garden-variety California liberals.


304
0:14:34,65 --> 0:14:37,59
He's just like baffled by any
other sort of worldview.


305
0:14:37,59 --> 0:14:40,475
He called 19th-century
whalers idiots.


306
0:14:40,475 --> 0:14:45,83
[LAUGHING]


307
0:14:45,83 --> 0:14:48,19
We've gotten a little bit
of a radio signal.


308
0:14:48,19 --> 0:14:51,74
We know the outside world
still exists, basically.


309
0:14:51,74 --> 0:14:53,43
We don't have, like--


310
0:14:53,43 --> 0:14:58,37
we don't have any idea what
exactly is going on there.


311
0:14:58,37 --> 0:15:1,425
I like these weird towers,
or dicks--


312
0:15:1,425 --> 0:15:2,8
dicks of cloud.


313
0:15:2,8 --> 0:15:6,55
One thing that's been killing
me, horniness.


314
0:15:6,55 --> 0:15:9,38
It's--


315
0:15:9,38 --> 0:15:10,86
first few days I was fine.


316
0:15:10,86 --> 0:15:12,145
But it's slowly waxing.


317
0:15:12,145 --> 0:15:17,3
I'm starting to, like, really
fucking pore through the


318
0:15:17,3 --> 0:15:20,2
memory card up here in my--


319
0:15:20,2 --> 0:15:21,83
I'm not even trying to.


320
0:15:21,83 --> 0:15:24,88
I'm just catching myself
in off hours.


321
0:15:24,88 --> 0:15:27,59
Our minds are just folding
in on themselves.


322
0:15:27,59 --> 0:15:33,1
Oh, as far as trajectory, if
this hand is California, and


323
0:15:33,1 --> 0:15:35,37
we started here in Long Beach,
we kind of did this.


324
0:15:35,37 --> 0:15:39,67
And now we're plunking our way
down into the gyre, which is


325
0:15:39,67 --> 0:15:41,17
right there.


326
0:15:41,17 --> 0:15:43,19
I think the current estimate is,
like, two or three days,


327
0:15:43,19 --> 0:15:45,29
when we're right in the
fucking thick of it.


328
0:15:45,29 --> 0:15:46,98
And then we can get
down to business.


329
0:15:46,98 --> 0:15:49,99
It'll be good to get out
to the patch because


330
0:15:49,99 --> 0:15:50,87
A, it'll give us--


331
0:15:50,87 --> 0:15:53,3
I mean, we'll be working out
there, as opposed to just,


332
0:15:53,3 --> 0:15:55,42
like, sitting around
and talking about


333
0:15:55,42 --> 0:15:57,76
how fast it's going.


334
0:15:57,76 --> 0:16:0,24
Also, it can serve as a
scapegoat for any tension


335
0:16:0,24 --> 0:16:2,7
that's building up, you know?


336
0:16:2,7 --> 0:16:6,22
You can just redirect your anger
towards the garbage.


337
0:16:6,22 --> 0:16:9,71
And also, I think it being a
bummer will help kind of level


338
0:16:9,71 --> 0:16:10,96
everybody's moods.


339
0:16:10,96 --> 0:16:29,34



340
0:16:29,34 --> 0:16:30,59
Thar she blows!


341
0:16:30,59 --> 0:16:37,11



342
0:16:37,11 --> 0:16:38,36
MEREDITH DANLUCK: Oh, god.


343
0:16:38,36 --> 0:16:41,43



344
0:16:41,43 --> 0:16:44,83
The only thing that exists is,
like, this boat, and the


345
0:16:44,83 --> 0:16:49,555
people on it, and whatever this
leviathan we're searching


346
0:16:49,555 --> 0:16:53,6
for, this Captain Ahab, Moby
Dick situation we have going


347
0:16:53,6 --> 0:16:57,56
on here for this trash island,
which I'm starting to get--


348
0:16:57,56 --> 0:17:2,2
If We don't fucking
find something--


349
0:17:2,2 --> 0:17:3,57
MEREDITH DANLUCK: --I'll
really lose my mind.


350
0:17:3,57 --> 0:17:7,574



351
0:17:7,574 --> 0:17:9,874
MEREDITH DANLUCK: That's what's
freaking me out, man.


352
0:17:9,874 --> 0:17:18,34



353
0:17:18,34 --> 0:17:21,5
Captain, how far now until
the garbage patch?


354
0:17:21,5 --> 0:17:24,94
CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE: Yeah,
we're a day away.


355
0:17:24,94 --> 0:17:29,21
We're just penetrating into
the second cell right now.


356
0:17:29,21 --> 0:17:31,67
JAKE BURGHART: This is where
we expect to find the--


357
0:17:31,67 --> 0:17:32,83
CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE: That's
where we'd expect to find the


358
0:17:32,83 --> 0:17:36,26
highest concentrations, yeah.


359
0:17:36,26 --> 0:17:37,27
JAKE BURGHART: We just
officially passed


360
0:17:37,27 --> 0:17:39,38
the 1,500 mile mark.


361
0:17:39,38 --> 0:17:43,32
We got 1,500 miles to go, so
we're halfway, which is


362
0:17:43,32 --> 0:17:47,69
insane, because we've been
here for so fucking long.


363
0:17:47,69 --> 0:17:52,9
Thomas is up spotting
pieces of trash.


364
0:17:52,9 --> 0:17:56,462
We've been seeing pieces of
trash every day, just, you


365
0:17:56,462 --> 0:17:58,24
know, here and there.


366
0:17:58,24 --> 0:18:2,9
I think in my mind--
and probably


367
0:18:2,9 --> 0:18:4,29
Meredith's and Thomas--


368
0:18:4,29 --> 0:18:7,15
we were eventually going
to arrive somewhere.


369
0:18:7,15 --> 0:18:9,5
We're going to get to the place
where this is where all


370
0:18:9,5 --> 0:18:11,33
the trash is.


371
0:18:11,33 --> 0:18:12,67
CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE: Everybody
says, show me a


372
0:18:12,67 --> 0:18:14,63
picture of the garbage.


373
0:18:14,63 --> 0:18:16,39
OK, well, it's spread out.


374
0:18:16,39 --> 0:18:17,5
It's diffuse.


375
0:18:17,5 --> 0:18:18,305
This is an enormous ocean.


376
0:18:18,305 --> 0:18:19,41
So you're not going to find--


377
0:18:19,41 --> 0:18:20,68
THOMAS MORTON: I understand
that.


378
0:18:20,68 --> 0:18:22,47
CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE: You're
not going to find a dump.


379
0:18:22,47 --> 0:18:24,0
There's no trash
dump down here.


380
0:18:24,0 --> 0:18:26,7
JAKE BURGHART: I was sort of
under the impression that


381
0:18:26,7 --> 0:18:29,43
there was going to be a visible
patch somewhere, where


382
0:18:29,43 --> 0:18:30,55
it's like--


383
0:18:30,55 --> 0:18:31,8
where you could walk out on the
deck and just be like--


384
0:18:31,8 --> 0:18:32,19
CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE: Well,
there's a windrow.


385
0:18:32,19 --> 0:18:33,53
JAKE BURGHART: --there's
garbage, garbage, garbage,


386
0:18:33,53 --> 0:18:34,2
everywhere.


387
0:18:34,2 --> 0:18:34,8
Yeah, like you were saying--


388
0:18:34,8 --> 0:18:35,14
CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE:
A windrow of garbage.


389
0:18:35,14 --> 0:18:35,56
--patterns in the garbage.


390
0:18:35,56 --> 0:18:35,72
CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE:
But it's a line


391
0:18:35,72 --> 0:18:37,7
and it's not a pattern.


392
0:18:37,7 --> 0:18:41,28
JAKE BURGHART: We just need,
like, for the big--


393
0:18:41,28 --> 0:18:44,2
we've got everything we need,
so much good stuff, so much


394
0:18:44,2 --> 0:18:44,75
good information.


395
0:18:44,75 --> 0:18:46,73
And I'm really happy, I think
it's a really good piece.


396
0:18:46,73 --> 0:18:48,37
But we need the big--


397
0:18:48,37 --> 0:18:51,12
CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE: Well, I
think that it's your job to


398
0:18:51,12 --> 0:18:52,1
stay on deck.


399
0:18:52,1 --> 0:18:54,75
MEREDITH DANLUCK: Yeah, but we
also have to sleep for at


400
0:18:54,75 --> 0:18:58,57
least a few hours every day.


401
0:18:58,57 --> 0:19:0,53
JAKE BURGHART: We're all on the
same team, we just need to


402
0:19:0,53 --> 0:19:1,4
get something that--


403
0:19:1,4 --> 0:19:2,425
CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE:
Well, we're ready


404
0:19:2,425 --> 0:19:3,83
to move to any location.


405
0:19:3,83 --> 0:19:6,52
It's not so important
where you look.


406
0:19:6,52 --> 0:19:9,564
It's looking at the calmest
part of the ocean.


407
0:19:9,564 --> 0:19:11,52
Because that's when the stuff
floats up to the top.


408
0:19:11,52 --> 0:19:13,17
The crap is everywhere.


409
0:19:13,17 --> 0:19:15,31
But it floats up to the
top in the calm.


410
0:19:15,31 --> 0:19:16,25
Well, that's where
I've brought you.


411
0:19:16,25 --> 0:19:17,39
I've brought you to the calm.


412
0:19:17,39 --> 0:19:19,258
This is the calmest
part of the ocean.


413
0:19:19,258 --> 0:19:44,83



414
0:19:44,83 --> 0:19:46,89
JAKE BURGHART: Woo!


415
0:19:46,89 --> 0:19:49,77
Fuck you!


416
0:19:49,77 --> 0:19:53,61
Spring break, the gyre, 2007!


417
0:19:53,61 --> 0:19:54,86
Woo!


418
0:19:54,86 --> 0:19:57,49



419
0:19:57,49 --> 0:19:58,365
Boo-ya!


420
0:19:58,365 --> 0:19:59,64
MEREDITH DANLUCK:
Another buoy?


421
0:19:59,64 --> 0:20:1,13
THOMAS MORTON: That's a--
or is it a helmet?


422
0:20:1,13 --> 0:20:1,97
MEREDITH DANLUCK:
It's a helmet.


423
0:20:1,97 --> 0:20:3,82
THOMAS MORTON: Dude,
that's creepy.


424
0:20:3,82 --> 0:20:5,36
MEREDITH DANLUCK: That
is so creepy.


425
0:20:5,36 --> 0:20:7,15
THOMAS MORTON: Creepy as shit.


426
0:20:7,15 --> 0:20:10,7
MEREDITH DANLUCK: With a
big chunk out of it.


427
0:20:10,7 --> 0:20:12,62
JAKE BURGHART: Put it on.


428
0:20:12,62 --> 0:20:12,97
[LAUGHING]


429
0:20:12,97 --> 0:20:14,22
THOMAS MORTON: That shit's
alive, asshole.


430
0:20:14,22 --> 0:20:17,33



431
0:20:17,33 --> 0:20:19,3
Ew, it's fucking moving.


432
0:20:19,3 --> 0:20:19,965
[LAUGHING]


433
0:20:19,965 --> 0:20:22,51
THOMAS MORTON: That
wasn't worth it.


434
0:20:22,51 --> 0:20:23,76
What kind of shot was that?


435
0:20:23,76 --> 0:20:24,88
Hang on.


436
0:20:24,88 --> 0:20:28,7
Should I be saying something?


437
0:20:28,7 --> 0:20:30,36
It's hard to believe,
looking at this.


438
0:20:30,36 --> 0:20:34,457
I mean, this water is, like,
beyond Crayola blue.


439
0:20:34,457 --> 0:20:36,792
JAKE BURGHART: We got
some fucking--


440
0:20:36,792 --> 0:20:37,726
MEREDITH DANLUCK: Ew!


441
0:20:37,726 --> 0:20:39,13
THOMAS MORTON: Ew!


442
0:20:39,13 --> 0:20:40,454
MEREDITH DANLUCK: I don't
want that one.


443
0:20:40,454 --> 0:20:42,82
[LAUGHING]


444
0:20:42,82 --> 0:20:44,49
THOMAS MORTON: That's
glass though, right?


445
0:20:44,49 --> 0:20:45,54
So that's not as bad?


446
0:20:45,54 --> 0:20:46,48
Or--


447
0:20:46,48 --> 0:20:47,89
JAKE BURGHART: That's not
so much of a concern.


448
0:20:47,89 --> 0:20:49,148
[ENGINE REVVING]


449
0:20:49,148 --> 0:20:50,372
MEREDITH DANLUCK: Wait,
wait, wait.


450
0:20:50,372 --> 0:20:51,71
Whoa, whoa, whoa.


451
0:20:51,71 --> 0:20:52,1
Jake.
