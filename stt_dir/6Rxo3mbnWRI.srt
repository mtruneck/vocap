0:0:1,27 --> 0:0:2,36
STEVE SPANGLER: Ping
pong balls.


3
0:0:2,36 --> 0:0:5,39
There's just something fun at
the sound of a ping pong ball.


4
0:0:5,39 --> 0:0:7,14
I want to find a way to
be able to make a


5
0:0:7,14 --> 0:0:8,23
ping pong ball fly.


6
0:0:8,23 --> 0:0:9,69
And not just like this--


7
0:0:9,69 --> 0:0:11,7
I want to find a way to be able
to make a ping pong ball


8
0:0:11,7 --> 0:0:13,21
fly with force.


9
0:0:13,21 --> 0:0:15,2
And you can't just have
one ping pong ball.


10
0:0:15,2 --> 0:0:18,31
It's better if you have dozens
and dozens and dozens of ping


11
0:0:18,31 --> 0:0:19,716
pong balls.


12
0:0:19,716 --> 0:0:21,27
I want to find a way
to launch them.


13
0:0:21,27 --> 0:0:23,73
I think I have some
really cool ideas.


14
0:0:23,73 --> 0:0:26,81
I'm Steve Spangler, and I'm all
about making science fun.


15
0:0:26,81 --> 0:0:29,95
For the last 20 years, I've
been teaching ways to turn


16
0:0:29,95 --> 0:0:32,96
ordinary science experiments
into unforgettable learning


17
0:0:32,96 --> 0:0:33,98
experiences.


18
0:0:33,98 --> 0:0:36,61
I have an amazing team who will
do whatever it takes to


19
0:0:36,61 --> 0:0:39,36
affect the way people
think about science.


20
0:0:39,36 --> 0:0:41,63
And do that, I live
by one motto--


21
0:0:41,63 --> 0:0:44,655
make it big, do it right,
give it class.


22
0:0:44,655 --> 0:0:50,24



23
0:0:50,24 --> 0:0:52,61
As a kid, I remember this ping
pong ball popper that was


24
0:0:52,61 --> 0:0:53,12
pretty cool.


25
0:0:53,12 --> 0:0:55,36
It was just this kind
of rubber device


26
0:0:55,36 --> 0:0:56,48
that had air inside.


27
0:0:56,48 --> 0:0:58,58
You would just kind of push this
inside and squeeze it.


28
0:0:58,58 --> 0:0:59,13
It would pop.


29
0:0:59,13 --> 0:1:1,125
It wasn't terribly exciting,
but it was a


30
0:1:1,125 --> 0:1:2,22
ping pong ball launcher.


31
0:1:2,22 --> 0:1:5,375
And then I saw this
at the auto store.


32
0:1:5,375 --> 0:1:6,68
It's a battery filler.


33
0:1:6,68 --> 0:1:7,56
See this?


34
0:1:7,56 --> 0:1:9,72
This might be perfect
for the first part.


35
0:1:9,72 --> 0:1:11,66
Now, I'm not advocating
that you tear this


36
0:1:11,66 --> 0:1:12,79
apart at the store.


37
0:1:12,79 --> 0:1:14,3
You're going to have
to buy it first.


38
0:1:14,3 --> 0:1:17,15
But that's the piece that you
want-- this to the wayside.


39
0:1:17,15 --> 0:1:17,62
All right.


40
0:1:17,62 --> 0:1:21,6
So here's what happens is the
ping pong ball fits perfectly


41
0:1:21,6 --> 0:1:22,34
inside here like this.


42
0:1:22,34 --> 0:1:24,65
It's just got enough pressure
around it, like that.


43
0:1:24,65 --> 0:1:25,54
That's perfect.


44
0:1:25,54 --> 0:1:27,76
And when you squeeze
it-- here, watch.


45
0:1:27,76 --> 0:1:28,52
Bam.


46
0:1:28,52 --> 0:1:30,29
This is a pretty good.


47
0:1:30,29 --> 0:1:33,65
What if there was an explosion
inside, firing the ball out?


48
0:1:33,65 --> 0:1:34,96
That would be even better.


49
0:1:34,96 --> 0:1:37,83
And to do that, we've got to
go to the camping aisle.


50
0:1:37,83 --> 0:1:38,86
Well, this is what you're
looking for.


51
0:1:38,86 --> 0:1:41,62
It's a lantern spark igniter.


52
0:1:41,62 --> 0:1:44,2
So when you twist it,
the flint inside


53
0:1:44,2 --> 0:1:45,2
gives it a little spark.


54
0:1:45,2 --> 0:1:46,3
This is what you're
going to need.


55
0:1:46,3 --> 0:1:46,945
So take that home.


56
0:1:46,945 --> 0:1:49,8
You're also going to need to
have some simple rules.


57
0:1:49,8 --> 0:1:52,2
And we're ready to build
ourselves an igniter.


58
0:1:52,2 --> 0:1:54,8
The first step is to take that
battery bulb and to poke a


59
0:1:54,8 --> 0:1:55,39
hole in it.


60
0:1:55,39 --> 0:1:58,29
The size of a screwdriver seems
to be just about right.


61
0:1:58,29 --> 0:2:0,77
I don't want it too big-- kind
of see what's going on inside,


62
0:2:0,77 --> 0:2:2,31
just kind of poking it
through like that.


63
0:2:2,31 --> 0:2:3,695
That will be perfect.


64
0:2:3,695 --> 0:2:7,65
And then you just need to take
apart the lantern lighter--


65
0:2:7,65 --> 0:2:9,46
the little spark
igniter, right?


66
0:2:9,46 --> 0:2:13,1
So what I did was, just with a
pair of pliers, loosened this


67
0:2:13,1 --> 0:2:14,81
and took this apart.


68
0:2:14,81 --> 0:2:15,32
All right?


69
0:2:15,32 --> 0:2:17,26
You need to be careful, because
this is spring-loaded.


70
0:2:17,26 --> 0:2:19,24
It'll pop out, and it takes you
another five minutes to


71
0:2:19,24 --> 0:2:20,77
stick everything
back in again.


72
0:2:20,77 --> 0:2:24,33
What we want to do is to get
this inside the bulb.


73
0:2:24,33 --> 0:2:26,87
So I'm going to put this down
inside and try to feed that in


74
0:2:26,87 --> 0:2:29,47
through here so it pops out
the other side, and we can


75
0:2:29,47 --> 0:2:30,345
twist this in place.


76
0:2:30,345 --> 0:2:31,34
Oh, that's perfect.


77
0:2:31,34 --> 0:2:32,61
This is what we're
trying to do.


78
0:2:32,61 --> 0:2:33,68
Take a look at this.


79
0:2:33,68 --> 0:2:36,5
See how I finally get this down
inside here like this?


80
0:2:36,5 --> 0:2:38,39
That's perfect.


81
0:2:38,39 --> 0:2:41,53
Again, you want to be very
careful that you don't push on


82
0:2:41,53 --> 0:2:43,73
this little piece here,
or it'll pop out.


83
0:2:43,73 --> 0:2:46,18
Now, I'm going to try to expose
the threads that are


84
0:2:46,18 --> 0:2:46,98
right there--


85
0:2:46,98 --> 0:2:49,44
so you see-- so we have
something to grab onto--


86
0:2:49,44 --> 0:2:50,56
that part right there.


87
0:2:50,56 --> 0:2:54,75
Washer goes on top like this.


88
0:2:54,75 --> 0:2:56,71
This piece goes on top.


89
0:2:56,71 --> 0:2:59,33
And now you just have to
screw it together.


90
0:2:59,33 --> 0:3:2,67
The entire time, I'm keeping my
finger on that little flute


91
0:3:2,67 --> 0:3:6,24
mechanism that's inside so
it doesn't pop back.


92
0:3:6,24 --> 0:3:8,24
So that's pretty good.


93
0:3:8,24 --> 0:3:10,51
I'm even going to try to tighten
it up a little bit


94
0:3:10,51 --> 0:3:13,4
just so it doesn't
come undone.


95
0:3:13,4 --> 0:3:14,5
Perfect.


96
0:3:14,5 --> 0:3:17,21
Now, the last part will make
you very angry if you don't


97
0:3:17,21 --> 0:3:19,66
keep your finger on that flint,
because it's now time


98
0:3:19,66 --> 0:3:21,455
to put this end back on.


99
0:3:21,455 --> 0:3:24,28
And if you're not careful,
it'll pop


100
0:3:24,28 --> 0:3:25,16
right back out again.


101
0:3:25,16 --> 0:3:27,42
So put this on here like this.


102
0:3:27,42 --> 0:3:30,75



103
0:3:30,75 --> 0:3:31,57
All right, perfect.


104
0:3:31,57 --> 0:3:33,12
I think this should be great.


105
0:3:33,12 --> 0:3:35,1
Take a look down inside
here like this.


106
0:3:35,1 --> 0:3:35,55
Watch.


107
0:3:35,55 --> 0:3:38,36
When you spin it, watch.


108
0:3:38,36 --> 0:3:40,3
See the little spark
that's inside?


109
0:3:40,3 --> 0:3:43,79
That's the spark that we want
to ignite the fuel that


110
0:3:43,79 --> 0:3:46,5
eventually will pop the
ping pong ball out.


111
0:3:46,5 --> 0:3:47,81
I think this is great.


112
0:3:47,81 --> 0:3:49,36
All right, safety first,
because now it's


113
0:3:49,36 --> 0:3:50,23
time for the fuel.


114
0:3:50,23 --> 0:3:52,56
And if you're a minor, make
sure that you get an adult


115
0:3:52,56 --> 0:3:53,98
who's going to help
you out with this.


116
0:3:53,98 --> 0:3:55,2
Here's the fuel--


117
0:3:55,2 --> 0:3:56,72
90% rubbing alcohol.


118
0:3:56,72 --> 0:3:58,57
I think this says 91%.


119
0:3:58,57 --> 0:4:0,5
Most rubbing alcohol is 70%.


120
0:4:0,5 --> 0:4:2,27
You're going to have to go to
the drugstore for this.


121
0:4:2,27 --> 0:4:5,25
And since I'm only going to use
drops at a time and I want


122
0:4:5,25 --> 0:4:7,85
to pour a lot out, I simply
switched a small amount to


123
0:4:7,85 --> 0:4:9,2
this bottle right here.


124
0:4:9,2 --> 0:4:9,73
All right.


125
0:4:9,73 --> 0:4:11,93
You just need a small amount
of the rubbing alcohol, so


126
0:4:11,93 --> 0:4:14,87
this is 15 or 20 drops
in here like this.


127
0:4:14,87 --> 0:4:17,17
I'm being careful not to
get the flint wet.


128
0:4:17,17 --> 0:4:19,959
And if you've shot it before,
because there's no oxygen


129
0:4:19,959 --> 0:4:23,61
inside, you're going to go a
little bit of air inside--


130
0:4:23,61 --> 0:4:25,79
just trying to move it
around so there's


131
0:4:25,79 --> 0:4:27,45
enough there to combust.


132
0:4:27,45 --> 0:4:30,63
Now, you need to
ping pong ball.


133
0:4:30,63 --> 0:4:34,53
Ping pong ball goes down
inside like this.


134
0:4:34,53 --> 0:4:35,7
So now, here's what happens.


135
0:4:35,7 --> 0:4:36,16
Be careful.


136
0:4:36,16 --> 0:4:37,66
This is the business end.


137
0:4:37,66 --> 0:4:40,31
So when you flick it like this,
you get a spark inside.


138
0:4:40,31 --> 0:4:42,3
The spark ignites the
rubbing alcohol.


139
0:4:42,3 --> 0:4:45,88
The rubbing alcohol expands as
it turns into a gas, and


140
0:4:45,88 --> 0:4:47,69
hopefully it shoots the
ping pong ball out.


141
0:4:47,69 --> 0:4:50,47
It looks something like this.


142
0:4:50,47 --> 0:4:50,79
What?


143
0:4:50,79 --> 0:4:52,38
You want me to do it again?


144
0:4:52,38 --> 0:4:53,11
Of course.


145
0:4:53,11 --> 0:4:55,883
I have an entire bucket
of these and a


146
0:4:55,883 --> 0:4:56,98
lot of rubbing alcohol.

0:5:6,7 --> 0:5:9,46
Now, if for any reason there's
still a flame that's here,


153
0:5:9,46 --> 0:5:10,99
that's why I have a
plate close by.


154
0:5:10,99 --> 0:5:13,64
I just put the plate over the
top and it stops the flame


155
0:5:13,64 --> 0:5:15,5
completely.


156
0:5:15,5 --> 0:5:16,44
Don't put your hand
over the top.


157
0:5:16,44 --> 0:5:19,38
Just put the plate over the
top and everything is set.


158
0:5:19,38 --> 0:5:22,62
This is a pretty cool ping
pong ball launcher.


159
0:5:22,62 --> 0:5:25,52
So we were recently contacted
by a marketing firm that


160
0:5:25,52 --> 0:5:28,2
actually works for YouTube,
and they wanted us to fire


161
0:5:28,2 --> 0:5:29,36
some ping pong balls.


162
0:5:29,36 --> 0:5:31,17
But they wanted us to fire
of more than just


163
0:5:31,17 --> 0:5:32,13
one ping pong ball.


164
0:5:32,13 --> 0:5:34,62
They wanted 6,000
ping pong balls.


165
0:5:34,62 --> 0:5:36,98
And if you're going to fire
6,000 ping pong balls, this is


166
0:5:36,98 --> 0:5:38,3
probably not a good idea.


167
0:5:38,3 --> 0:5:40,15
So I knew I needed to
have a bigger space.


168
0:5:40,15 --> 0:5:44,13
So I got some liquid nitrogen,
a 55 gallon drum, 6,000 ping


169
0:5:44,13 --> 0:5:47,6
pong balls, and a little
bit bigger space.


170
0:5:47,6 --> 0:5:49,8
And I think we got just exactly
what they needed.


171
0:5:49,8 --> 0:5:51,636
Watch out.


172
0:5:51,636 --> 0:5:53,59
All right, so here's what
we're doing right now.


173
0:5:53,59 --> 0:5:56,18
We just want to test just the
liquid nitrogen in the barrel


174
0:5:56,18 --> 0:5:57,8
and just see kind of
what happens before


175
0:5:57,8 --> 0:5:58,86
the ping pong balls.


176
0:5:58,86 --> 0:6:0,74
It's actually much better with
the ping pong balls, because


177
0:6:0,74 --> 0:6:1,94
they cushion them.


178
0:6:1,94 --> 0:6:4,73
So this is going to be the worst
loud explosion up here.


179
0:6:4,73 --> 0:6:6,3

0:6:58,425 --> 0:7:0,64



207
0:7:0,64 --> 0:7:2,1
STEVE SPANGLER: What's important
about this is we get


208
0:7:2,1 --> 0:7:3,37
pristine two liter bottles.


209
0:7:3,37 --> 0:7:5,82
We don't want anything that's
been crushed or wrinkled or


210
0:7:5,82 --> 0:7:6,35
anything like that.


211
0:7:6,35 --> 0:7:7,14
That's a bad situation.


212
0:7:7,14 --> 0:7:9,675
I don't know what the stress is
on that bottle, so I want


213
0:7:9,675 --> 0:7:12,705
brand new ones.


214
0:7:12,705 --> 0:7:14,5
This is Brad Montgomery--


215
0:7:14,5 --> 0:7:17,26
a really, really good friend,
funny, funny, funny, comedian,


216
0:7:17,26 --> 0:7:19,62
magician, best friend.


217
0:7:19,62 --> 0:7:20,71
This is how it works.


218
0:7:20,71 --> 0:7:21,47
BRAD MONTGOMERY: New
glasses work.


219
0:7:21,47 --> 0:7:22,98
STEVE SPANGLER: Yes, and he's
got his new glasses.


220
0:7:22,98 --> 0:7:25,85
And the deal is we're going
stage him in my office.


221
0:7:25,85 --> 0:7:27,605
And so he's just supposed to
sit there and just pretend


222
0:7:27,605 --> 0:7:28,75
like he doesn't even realize
what's going to happen.


223
0:7:28,75 --> 0:7:30,29
BRAD MONTGOMERY: And I'm totally
going to prank with


224
0:7:30,29 --> 0:7:31,2
your computer.


225
0:7:31,2 --> 0:7:32,45
STEVE SPANGLER: Yeah.


226
0:7:32,45 --> 0:7:38,51



227
0:7:38,51 --> 0:7:41,86
Why don't you be the
safety advisor?


228
0:7:41,86 --> 0:7:43,11
BRAD MONTGOMERY: Yes.


229
0:7:43,11 --> 0:7:59,58



230
0:7:59,58 --> 0:8:0,87
Steve's making a big
fuss over this.


231
0:8:0,87 --> 0:8:3,28
It's not a horrible idea, but
I'm telling you, it's not as


232
0:8:3,28 --> 0:8:6,67
cool as he thought, because
I did this yesterday.


233
0:8:6,67 --> 0:8:8,703
OK, not totally 6,000--


234
0:8:8,703 --> 0:8:11,35
around 3,000, 3,500
ping pong balls.


235
0:8:11,35 --> 0:8:13,94
So I mean, it's pretty cool.


236
0:8:13,94 --> 0:8:15,34
You'd think he's--


237
0:8:15,34 --> 0:8:16,51
woo, 6,000!


238
0:8:16,51 --> 0:8:19,125
Whatever.


239
0:8:19,125 --> 0:8:21,4
STEVE SPANGLER: Oh,
that's perfect.


240
0:8:21,4 --> 0:8:22,42
I'm ready.


241
0:8:22,42 --> 0:8:25,2
For today's experiment, we're
going to demonstrate just how


242
0:8:25,2 --> 0:8:28,0
many views YouTube Mobile
gets in a single day.


243
0:8:28,0 --> 0:8:32,39
So let's say this represents
YouTube.


244
0:8:32,39 --> 0:8:33,87
See that ping pong
ball right there?


245
0:8:33,87 --> 0:8:37,12
It represents 100,000 views
from mobile devices.


246
0:8:37,12 --> 0:8:40,2
And this bottle of
liquid nitrogen?


247
0:8:40,2 --> 0:8:41,61
It doesn't represent anything.


248
0:8:41,61 --> 0:8:43,25
It's just really cool.


249
0:8:43,25 --> 0:8:44,36
[MUSIC PLAYING]


250
0:8:44,36 --> 0:8:45,61
STEVE SPANGLER: Don't
try this at home.


251

0:9:40,7 --> 0:9:49,53

255
0:9:52,6 --> 0:9:53,33
Steve.


256
0:9:53,33 --> 0:9:53,89
STEVE SPANGLER: What?


257
0:9:53,89 --> 0:9:59,63
FEMALE SPEAKER: Do you want
tuna salad or turkey wrap?


258
0:9:59,63 --> 0:10:0,53
STEVE SPANGLER: I want
turkey wrap.


259
0:10:0,53 --> 0:10:1,67
FEMALE SPEAKER: OK.


260
0:10:1,67 --> 0:10:3,524
STEVE SPANGLER: Thanks.


261
0:10:3,524 --> 0:10:4,774
A hundred--
