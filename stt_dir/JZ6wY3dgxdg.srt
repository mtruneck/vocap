0:0:0,488 --> 0:0:12,688
[MUSIC PLAYING]


3
0:0:12,688 --> 0:0:14,152
DAVID CHOE: We did it.


4
0:0:14,152 --> 0:0:17,57



5
0:0:17,57 --> 0:0:20,87
After years and years of
traveling, I finally completed


6
0:0:20,87 --> 0:0:22,69
all 50 states.


7
0:0:22,69 --> 0:0:25,28
Alaska, mission accomplished.


8
0:0:25,28 --> 0:0:26,38
I've been to all the states.


9
0:0:26,38 --> 0:0:27,27
This is the last one.


10
0:0:27,27 --> 0:0:27,9
Years on the road.


11
0:0:27,9 --> 0:0:30,14
It's pretty exciting to come
to a new place you


12
0:0:30,14 --> 0:0:32,452
haven't been to.


13
0:0:32,452 --> 0:0:34,3
We had our first casualty
on the road.


14
0:0:34,3 --> 0:0:38,15



15
0:0:38,15 --> 0:0:41,89
After more than 24 hours of
riding in a plane with Andrew,


16
0:0:41,89 --> 0:0:44,35
him showing off doing flight
tricks and stuff, at some


17
0:0:44,35 --> 0:0:48,65
point he was either rough play
with the hat or while we were


18
0:0:48,65 --> 0:0:51,57
ghost-riding the whip, this
is what happened.


19
0:0:51,57 --> 0:0:52,97
So we gotta fix that.


20
0:0:52,97 --> 0:0:54,92
That's like cutting
Samson's hair.


21
0:0:54,92 --> 0:0:57,441
And when we stopped to refuel,
we got Harry a new shirt.


22
0:0:57,441 --> 0:0:57,938
Wardrobe change.


23
0:0:57,938 --> 0:0:59,926
We still got the
tag back here.


24
0:0:59,926 --> 0:1:0,423
HARRY KIM: Oh, yeah.


25
0:1:0,423 --> 0:1:1,914
That's cool.


26
0:1:1,914 --> 0:1:4,41
DAVID CHOE: So let's
get rid of that.


27
0:1:4,41 --> 0:1:4,984
I feel good.


28
0:1:4,984 --> 0:1:5,76
The air's clean.


29
0:1:5,76 --> 0:1:6,74
The air's fresh.


30
0:1:6,74 --> 0:1:8,89
We're in the land of
the midnight sun.


31
0:1:8,89 --> 0:1:12,335
And as the sun doesn't
set over Alaska,


32
0:1:12,335 --> 0:1:13,896
here goes day nine.


33
0:1:13,896 --> 0:1:29,46



34
0:1:29,46 --> 0:1:32,37
Thumb's up, America, it's the
coldest it's ever been on our


35
0:1:32,37 --> 0:1:33,52
entire trip.


36
0:1:33,52 --> 0:1:36,49
Just a doing a little
bit of graffiti like


37
0:1:36,49 --> 0:1:37,635
I'm a teenager again.


38
0:1:37,635 --> 0:1:40,345
And I think someone saw me,
someone called the cops.


39
0:1:40,345 --> 0:1:42,21
So we're trying to find
a place to duck out.


40
0:1:42,21 --> 0:1:45,8



41
0:1:45,8 --> 0:1:45,52
Let's go.


42
0:1:45,52 --> 0:1:48,636
Let's go.


43
0:1:48,636 --> 0:1:53,4



44
0:1:53,4 --> 0:1:55,3
DAVID CHOE: [INAUDIBLE]
get this.


45
0:1:55,3 --> 0:1:58,69
Um, we're just cruising
Alaska.


46
0:1:58,69 --> 0:2:0,18
We've never been to
Alaska before.


47
0:2:0,18 --> 0:2:2,64
We're just coming to town
to play our music.


48
0:2:2,64 --> 0:2:5,79
What are you doing?


49
0:2:5,79 --> 0:2:6,57
DAVID CHOE: Can you see
what you're doing


50
0:2:6,57 --> 0:2:8,37
with that mask on?


51
0:2:8,37 --> 0:2:9,611
You're getting your hair--


52
0:2:9,611 --> 0:2:11,38
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE]
my hair cut.


53
0:2:11,38 --> 0:2:13,3
DAVID CHOE: America, we just
found a guy getting his hair


54
0:2:13,3 --> 0:2:14,25
cut by a robot.


55
0:2:14,25 --> 0:2:15,88
It's about 3:00 in the
morning right now.


56
0:2:15,88 --> 0:2:16,63
Hey, how about this?


57
0:2:16,63 --> 0:2:18,7
My friend plays you a song,
you cut his hair.


58
0:2:18,7 --> 0:2:19,6
Hey, let's go.


59
0:2:19,6 --> 0:2:22,16
Let's go check out this shit.


60
0:2:22,16 --> 0:2:24,1
Oh my god.


61
0:2:24,1 --> 0:2:27,89
Um, wow.


62
0:2:27,89 --> 0:2:29,31
What's your name?


63
0:2:29,31 --> 0:2:30,42
MARK WILLIS: My name's
Mark Willis.


64
0:2:30,42 --> 0:2:30,97
DAVID CHOE: I've Dave.


65
0:2:30,97 --> 0:2:31,33
Nice to meet you.


66
0:2:31,33 --> 0:2:31,64
MARK WILLIS: Nice to meet you.


67
0:2:31,64 --> 0:2:32,81
DAVID CHOE: This is
my buddy, Harry.


68
0:2:32,81 --> 0:2:33,5
HARRY KIM: How you doing?


69
0:2:33,5 --> 0:2:34,15
MARK WILLIS: Just getting
hammered tonight,


70
0:2:34,15 --> 0:2:35,9
getting my hair cut.


71
0:2:35,9 --> 0:2:36,32
What are you guys up to?


72
0:2:36,32 --> 0:2:38,5
DAVID CHOE: Hopefully,
we're about to get


73
0:2:38,5 --> 0:2:39,35
Harry's hair cut too.


74
0:2:39,35 --> 0:2:43,115
You guys ready to
hear some music?


75
0:2:43,115 --> 0:2:44,97
DAVID CHOE: Oh, shit.


76
0:2:44,97 --> 0:2:44,588
Hi.


77
0:2:44,588 --> 0:2:45,838
MALE SPEAKER: Hi.


78
0:2:45,838 --> 0:2:49,99



79
0:2:49,99 --> 0:2:52,7
DAVID CHOE: Oh.


80
0:2:52,7 --> 0:2:53,86
DAVID CHOE: OK, sorry.


81
0:2:53,86 --> 0:2:55,83
Is this your room?


82
0:2:55,83 --> 0:2:56,3
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah,
you can come in.


83
0:2:56,3 --> 0:2:57,28
DAVID CHOE: Can we, can we?


84
0:2:57,28 --> 0:3:2,12



85
0:3:2,12 --> 0:3:4,51
DAVID CHOE: This place
is awesome.


86
0:3:4,51 --> 0:3:8,8
You guys, you guys look like
a very crazy couple.


87
0:3:8,8 --> 0:3:9,835
MARK WILLIS: Well, you know.


88
0:3:9,835 --> 0:3:11,24
CORNELIUS: We've
been told that.


89
0:3:11,24 --> 0:3:12,82
MARK WILLIS: Heard that
a few times before.


90
0:3:12,82 --> 0:3:16,17
DAVID CHOE: You, you guys seem
very comfortable with who you


91
0:3:16,17 --> 0:3:17,7
are as people.


92
0:3:17,7 --> 0:3:17,62
MARK WILLIS: Oh, we are.


93
0:3:17,62 --> 0:3:19,16
CORNELIUS: We like to have
nude [INAUDIBLE] parties.


94
0:3:19,16 --> 0:3:19,89
MARK WILLIS: We don't care.


95
0:3:19,89 --> 0:3:21,53
DAVID CHOE: You don't--?


96
0:3:21,53 --> 0:3:22,78
Well, listen.


97
0:3:22,78 --> 0:3:25,27



98
0:3:25,27 --> 0:3:27,77
You guys seem very open
to a lot of--


99
0:3:27,77 --> 0:3:28,81
I can't believe--


100
0:3:28,81 --> 0:3:31,31
can we see what you look
like under there?


101
0:3:31,31 --> 0:3:32,414
CORNELIUS: I love it.


102
0:3:32,414 --> 0:3:33,336
MARK WILLIS: Yeah.


103
0:3:33,336 --> 0:3:34,72
Yeah.


104
0:3:34,72 --> 0:3:35,29
DAVID CHOE: OK.


105
0:3:35,29 --> 0:3:38,185
America, we've just unmasked
Optimus Prime.


106
0:3:38,185 --> 0:3:39,983
Can you cut Harry's
hair, and then--


107
0:3:39,983 --> 0:3:40,97
CORNELIUS: We can do that.


108
0:3:40,97 --> 0:3:41,7
DAVID CHOE: OK.


109
0:3:41,7 --> 0:3:43,355
Yeah, let's do that.


110
0:3:43,355 --> 0:3:46,285
Um, we have a really good
cocktail going on here.


111
0:3:46,285 --> 0:3:49,11
We have Cornelius making
a bleach cocktail here.


112
0:3:49,11 --> 0:3:50,8
CORNELIUS: Oopsy doodle.


113
0:3:50,8 --> 0:3:53,6
DAVID CHOE: We have Andrew here,
who is the manager of


114
0:3:53,6 --> 0:3:56,8
the hotel here, who was a
little bit upset with us


115
0:3:56,8 --> 0:3:58,89
making a lot of noise outside,
but now he's definitely part


116
0:3:58,89 --> 0:3:59,9
of the party.


117
0:3:59,9 --> 0:4:3,62
We got our fella here, who's
making his own movie now on


118
0:4:3,62 --> 0:4:4,38
his cell phone.


119
0:4:4,38 --> 0:4:5,93
MARK WILLIS: This is
probably the--


120
0:4:5,93 --> 0:4:8,622
might be the second most
greatest thing I've ever done.


121
0:4:8,622 --> 0:4:11,41
But I'm glad I'm a part of
it, and this is awesome.


122
0:4:11,41 --> 0:4:11,82
DAVID CHOE: What--?


123
0:4:11,82 --> 0:4:13,1
MARK WILLIS: Let's keep going.


124
0:4:13,1 --> 0:4:14,9
DAVID CHOE: You want
to keep going.


125
0:4:14,9 --> 0:4:15,31
CORNELIUS: 'Cause this
stuff doesn't work if


126
0:4:15,31 --> 0:4:16,3
you wait too long.


127
0:4:16,3 --> 0:4:16,62
DAVID CHOE: OK.


128
0:4:16,62 --> 0:4:17,43
CORNELIUS: It dies.


129
0:4:17,43 --> 0:4:17,88
DAVID CHOE: OK.


130
0:4:17,88 --> 0:4:18,81
Let's get it going.


131
0:4:18,81 --> 0:4:19,11
CORNELIUS: All of it?


132
0:4:19,11 --> 0:4:20,31
Or do you want--


133
0:4:20,31 --> 0:4:21,399
HARRY KIM: Just give me--


134
0:4:21,399 --> 0:4:23,46
MARK WILLIS: What the fuck?


135
0:4:23,46 --> 0:4:24,855
That's pretty gnarly.


136
0:4:24,855 --> 0:4:27,42
CORNELIUS: Who wants
to hold the cup?


137
0:4:27,42 --> 0:4:27,69
DAVID CHOE: All right.


138
0:4:27,69 --> 0:4:29,82
So I thought we had
weird shit.


139
0:4:29,82 --> 0:4:35,9
We get in here, you guys have
huge, black fake boobs, an


140
0:4:35,9 --> 0:4:39,12
Optimus Prime mask, and just
like weird shit over here.


141
0:4:39,12 --> 0:4:40,935
Like--


142
0:4:40,935 --> 0:4:42,46
tit sandwich.


143
0:4:42,46 --> 0:4:43,43
Here's a good one.


144
0:4:43,43 --> 0:4:45,96
Ye olde chastity belt.


145
0:4:45,96 --> 0:4:46,98
Oh, wow.


146
0:4:46,98 --> 0:4:49,4
That looks painful.


147
0:4:49,4 --> 0:4:51,35
I really didn't know what we
were going to do once we got


148
0:4:51,35 --> 0:4:56,41
to Alaska, but I have to say,
it's crazier than Reno.


149
0:4:56,41 --> 0:4:58,32
It's wilder than Tijuana.


150
0:4:58,32 --> 0:5:2,57
It is the wackiest place I've
ever been on the planet.


151
0:5:2,57 --> 0:5:5,76
Harry looks like a pig in
shit, he's so happy.


152
0:5:5,76 --> 0:5:7,77
Jesus.


153
0:5:7,77 --> 0:5:10,105
Harry, she's fucking doing your
hair, like fucking play


154
0:5:10,105 --> 0:5:11,355
her a song, man.


155
0:5:11,355 --> 0:5:18,816



156
0:5:18,816 --> 0:5:21,636
MARK WILLIS: Now, you guys can
crash here if you guys like,


157
0:5:21,636 --> 0:5:24,29
but we gotta be out
of here by 8:30.


158
0:5:24,29 --> 0:5:25,89
DAVID CHOE: Oh, shit, you
guys have two rooms?


159
0:5:25,89 --> 0:5:26,78
MARK WILLIS: Yeah,
we got two rooms.


160
0:5:26,78 --> 0:5:29,105
We gotta be out of here by 8:30
because we have Sunday


161
0:5:29,105 --> 0:5:29,94
school in the morning.


162
0:5:29,94 --> 0:5:31,19
DAVID CHOE: You're going to
Sunday school tomorrow?


163
0:5:31,19 --> 0:5:31,58
MARK WILLIS: Yeah.


164
0:5:31,58 --> 0:5:32,23
I teach Sunday school.


165
0:5:32,23 --> 0:5:33,42
DAVID CHOE: You teach
Sunday school


166
0:5:33,42 --> 0:5:33,82
MARK WILLIS: Yeah.


167
0:5:33,82 --> 0:5:35,2
DAVID CHOE: Oh--


168
0:5:35,2 --> 0:5:36,825
MARK WILLIS: From fourth
to sixth grade.


169
0:5:36,825 --> 0:5:39,378
DAVID CHOE: You think, uh, you
think I could-- me and Harry


170
0:5:39,378 --> 0:5:42,23
could come visit you at Sunday
school if we find time?


171
0:5:42,23 --> 0:5:44,43
MARK WILLIS: Have you accepted
the Jesus Christ in your name.


172
0:5:44,43 --> 0:5:46,9
DAVID CHOE: I have accepted
Jesus Christ in my name.


173
0:5:46,9 --> 0:5:47,5
MARK WILLIS: Do you love him?


174
0:5:47,5 --> 0:5:49,656
DAVID CHOE: I do love Jesus, and
sometimes I wonder if he


175
0:5:49,656 --> 0:5:53,314
still loves me, but.


176
0:5:53,314 --> 0:5:54,564
Oh my god.


177
0:5:54,564 --> 0:5:56,74



178
0:5:56,74 --> 0:5:58,87
What the fuck is wrong
with you, dude?


179
0:5:58,87 --> 0:6:2,72
Wow, you can really see your
hair changing color.


180
0:6:2,72 --> 0:6:4,431
It's going to be like a
weird orange color.


181
0:6:4,431 --> 0:6:7,32
CORNELIUS: We can also
put more on--


182
0:6:7,32 --> 0:6:8,4
DAVID CHOE: Oh, shit.


183
0:6:8,4 --> 0:6:10,8
Your face is orange now,
for some reason.


184
0:6:10,8 --> 0:6:12,532
And now your hair's
turning orange.


185
0:6:12,532 --> 0:6:20,48



186
0:6:20,48 --> 0:6:24,36
If you don't mind me saying,
your wife is very attractive.


187
0:6:24,36 --> 0:6:26,987
When you guys are having sex,
are you wearing the mask, or


188
0:6:26,987 --> 0:6:27,985
she wearing the mask?


189
0:6:27,985 --> 0:6:31,1
CORNELIUS (VOICE OF OPTIMUS
PRIME): I wear it.


190
0:6:31,1 --> 0:6:32,7
DAVID CHOE: Don't worry
about shit, man.


191
0:6:32,7 --> 0:6:33,62
Life--


192
0:6:33,62 --> 0:6:35,79
life's too short to worry about
any bullshit, dude.


193
0:6:35,79 --> 0:6:37,24
I mean, you're a young guy.


194
0:6:37,24 --> 0:6:38,6
How old are you?


195
0:6:38,6 --> 0:6:39,72
MARK WILLIS: I'm 30.


196
0:6:39,72 --> 0:6:40,99
DAVID CHOE: See, you're
a young guy.


197
0:6:40,99 --> 0:6:42,44
You got the whole world open.


198
0:6:42,44 --> 0:6:44,47
Like what are your
hopes and dreams?


199
0:6:44,47 --> 0:6:45,585
What do you want to
do with your life?


200
0:6:45,585 --> 0:6:46,455
MARK WILLIS: I want
to climb Mt.


201
0:6:46,455 --> 0:6:47,43
Everest.


202
0:6:47,43 --> 0:6:48,435
That's my goal.


203
0:6:48,435 --> 0:6:49,57
DAVID CHOE: You'll
totally do it.


204
0:6:49,57 --> 0:6:50,49
MARK WILLIS: I'm not
even kidding, dude.


205
0:6:50,49 --> 0:6:50,93
That's my goal.


206
0:6:50,93 --> 0:6:51,91
DAVID CHOE: You totally
do it, man.


207
0:6:51,91 --> 0:6:54,12
MARK WILLIS: I'm not
even kidding.


208
0:6:54,12 --> 0:6:56,19
I want a child of our own.


209
0:6:56,19 --> 0:6:58,69



210
0:6:58,69 --> 0:7:1,51
Go to Costa Rica.


211
0:7:1,51 --> 0:7:4,13
Run down the beach.


212
0:7:4,13 --> 0:7:9,155
Roll in the sand naked and play
in the ocean with you.


213
0:7:9,155 --> 0:7:10,4
DAVID CHOE: Dude, you're
all right, man.


214
0:7:10,4 --> 0:7:11,4
I like you.


215
0:7:11,4 --> 0:7:12,4
You're a cool guy.


216
0:7:12,4 --> 0:7:13,65
Let's get some sleep,
all right?


217
0:7:13,65 --> 0:7:14,92
We've got a long day ahead
of us tomorrow.


218
0:7:14,92 --> 0:7:16,57
MARK WILLIS: Are we gonna,
are we gonna--


219
0:7:16,57 --> 0:7:17,9
DAVID CHOE: It's cool, man.


220
0:7:17,9 --> 0:7:17,45
Just go to sleep.


221
0:7:17,45 --> 0:7:18,3
Let's go to sleep.


222
0:7:18,3 --> 0:7:18,71
MARK WILLIS: All right.


223
0:7:18,71 --> 0:7:20,198
DAVID CHOE: Let's
get the lights.


224
0:7:20,198 --> 0:7:21,448
MARK WILLIS: All right.


225
0:7:21,448 --> 0:7:28,15



226
0:7:28,15 --> 0:7:30,6
DAVID CHOE: 10 fuckin' days.


227
0:7:30,6 --> 0:7:31,85
Thumbs up, America.


228
0:7:31,85 --> 0:7:36,34
10 days on the road.


229
0:7:36,34 --> 0:7:37,68
Sorta speechless right now.


230
0:7:37,68 --> 0:7:39,76
Truth is stranger
than fiction.


231
0:7:39,76 --> 0:7:41,6
I mean, you can't
write this shit.


232
0:7:41,6 --> 0:7:44,13



233
0:7:44,13 --> 0:7:46,34
This guy's got a
whole new look.


234
0:7:46,34 --> 0:7:51,76
I mean, the nicest, strangest
couple we ever met let us


235
0:7:51,76 --> 0:7:54,35
crash in their extra
bedroom last night.


236
0:7:54,35 --> 0:7:58,29
Said he had his 7 o'clock Sunday
morning school class,


237
0:7:58,29 --> 0:7:59,54
but I don't know if he
was full of shit.


238
0:7:59,54 --> 0:8:2,208
But we woke up and
they were gone.


239
0:8:2,208 --> 0:8:5,95
And we have some new additions
to the family.


240
0:8:5,95 --> 0:8:8,2
We have the Optimus
Prime head.


241
0:8:8,2 --> 0:8:10,9
They forgot their black fur
coat, which had an iPod


242
0:8:10,9 --> 0:8:12,21
charger in the pocket.


243
0:8:12,21 --> 0:8:15,34
And some black tits.


244
0:8:15,34 --> 0:8:16,65
It's a brand new
day in Alaska.


245
0:8:16,65 --> 0:8:18,26
The sun is shining bright.


246
0:8:18,26 --> 0:8:19,21
There's bears out there.


247
0:8:19,21 --> 0:8:21,1
There's Eskimos.


248
0:8:21,1 --> 0:8:22,79
Just when you thought
the trip was getting


249
0:8:22,79 --> 0:8:24,4
a little bit boring.


250
0:8:24,4 --> 0:8:25,85
Come on, America.


251
0:8:25,85 --> 0:8:26,65
Early bird gets the worm.


252
0:8:26,65 --> 0:8:27,9
Let's get going.


253
0:8:27,9 --> 0:8:34,83



254
0:8:34,83 --> 0:8:35,69
What's up, America.


255
0:8:35,69 --> 0:8:37,3
We're in Anchorage right now.


256
0:8:37,3 --> 0:8:38,19
We're here with--


257
0:8:38,19 --> 0:8:38,789
DANIEL: Daniel.


258
0:8:38,789 --> 0:8:39,38
DAVID CHOE: Daniel.


259
0:8:39,38 --> 0:8:41,8
Daniel is a German.


260
0:8:41,8 --> 0:8:43,14
DANIEL: I'm an immigrant.


261
0:8:43,14 --> 0:8:45,62
DAVID CHOE: He's a
German immigrant.


262
0:8:45,62 --> 0:8:47,67
And he's been here
for how long?


263
0:8:47,67 --> 0:8:48,48
DANIEL: Five months now.


264
0:8:48,48 --> 0:8:50,105
DAVID CHOE: And the five months
you've been here, what


265
0:8:50,105 --> 0:8:51,72
can you tell us about
living here?


266
0:8:51,72 --> 0:8:53,17
What's the good stuff?


267
0:8:53,17 --> 0:8:53,84
Bad stuff?


268
0:8:53,84 --> 0:8:55,29
DANIEL: Don't go to Anchorage.


269
0:8:55,29 --> 0:8:56,285
DAVID CHOE: Don't
go to Anchorage?


270
0:8:56,285 --> 0:8:57,48
DANIEL: Make it out of it.


271
0:8:57,48 --> 0:8:59,6
Take your first night and
get out of it, go to the


272
0:8:59,6 --> 0:8:59,72
countryside.


273
0:8:59,72 --> 0:9:1,6
See the beauty of the country.


274
0:9:1,6 --> 0:9:1,84
[INAUDIBLE].


275
0:9:1,84 --> 0:9:3,87
DAVID CHOE: Now I heard
stories about--


276
0:9:3,87 --> 0:9:6,9
I don't know if it's the North
Pole, but I heard stories


277
0:9:6,9 --> 0:9:7,77
about a North Pole.


278
0:9:7,77 --> 0:9:8,6
Have you heard anything
about that?


279
0:9:8,6 --> 0:9:9,87
DAVID CHOE: There
is North Pole.


280
0:9:9,87 --> 0:9:11,57
It's the town to go, man.


281
0:9:11,57 --> 0:9:13,28
Santa Claus there 365.


282
0:9:13,28 --> 0:9:16,3
Little lads running around
randy, it's Christmas every


283
0:9:16,3 --> 0:9:17,8
single day.


284
0:9:17,8 --> 0:9:18,86
It freaks your little
sister out man.


285
0:9:18,86 --> 0:9:19,47
Freaks it out.


286
0:9:19,47 --> 0:9:20,15
DAVID CHOE: Oh my god.


287
0:9:20,15 --> 0:9:21,7
All right.


288
0:9:21,7 --> 0:9:22,63
We gotta find Santa Claus.


289
0:9:22,63 --> 0:9:24,8
We heard he's-- we also heard
that he's a vampire


290
0:9:24,8 --> 0:9:25,62
that eats the elves.


291
0:9:25,62 --> 0:9:25,885
DANIEL: Absolutely.


292
0:9:25,885 --> 0:9:26,85
Do me one favor.


293
0:9:26,85 --> 0:9:28,28
Kick him in the nuts, if
you meet him, for me.


294
0:9:28,28 --> 0:9:28,96
DAVID CHOE: Kick him in
the nuts for you?


295
0:9:28,96 --> 0:9:29,9
DANIEL: Kick him in the nuts.


296
0:9:29,9 --> 0:9:30,61
DAVID CHOE: Daniel,
you're a champion.


297
0:9:30,61 --> 0:9:31,22
DANIEL: Pleasure meeting you.


298
0:9:31,22 --> 0:9:32,47
DAVID CHOE: Nice to
meet you too.


299
0:9:32,47 --> 0:9:40,91



300
0:9:40,91 --> 0:9:43,77
Fucking bullshit, man.


301
0:9:43,77 --> 0:9:46,605
That's the difference between
having a penis and a vagina.


302
0:9:46,605 --> 0:9:50,75
Those girls fucking were on
the street hitchhiking for


303
0:9:50,75 --> 0:9:55,54
less than 30 seconds before
they got picked up.


304
0:9:55,54 --> 0:9:57,43
Let's get the fuck out
of here, Harry.


305
0:9:57,43 --> 0:10:22,573



306
0:10:22,573 --> 0:10:23,52
Thumbs up, America.


307
0:10:23,52 --> 0:10:28,79
We just jumped into a minivan
on a cargo truck.


308
0:10:28,79 --> 0:10:31,51
What a lot of people don't know
is when you see those


309
0:10:31,51 --> 0:10:34,37
cargo trucks that are filled
with cars, trucks, BMWs,


310
0:10:34,37 --> 0:10:36,29
Mercedes, the doors
are always open.


311
0:10:36,29 --> 0:10:37,88
So when they pull up to rest
stops, it's really


312
0:10:37,88 --> 0:10:39,56
easy to jump in.


313
0:10:39,56 --> 0:10:41,92
Our guy's taking a mean dump, so
he hasn't come out yet, so


314
0:10:41,92 --> 0:10:44,23
we'll just lay low till
we get going.


315
0:10:44,23 --> 0:10:46,36
But these usually
go pretty far.


316
0:10:46,36 --> 0:10:49,11
So thumbs up, America.


317
0:10:49,11 --> 0:10:50,36
What a ride.


318
0:10:50,36 --> 0:11:14,576



319
0:11:14,576 --> 0:11:16,187
You need to fucking
get his tail.


320
0:11:16,187 --> 0:11:16,644
HARRY KIM: Yeah.


321
0:11:16,644 --> 0:11:18,3
We need a tail.


322
0:11:18,3 --> 0:11:21,71
DAVID CHOE: We gotta fucking
make it into another hat.


323
0:11:21,71 --> 0:11:23,145
Come on.


324
0:11:23,145 --> 0:11:24,1
Come on, Foxy.


325
0:11:24,1 --> 0:11:25,45
Come on, Foxy.


326
0:11:25,45 --> 0:11:29,887



327
0:11:29,887 --> 0:11:48,621
[DRUMS]


328
0:11:48,621 --> 0:11:50,2
DAVID CHOE: Thumbs
up, America.


329
0:11:50,2 --> 0:11:51,27
Ninja grappling hooks.


330
0:11:51,27 --> 0:11:59,454



331
0:11:59,454 --> 0:12:0,704
HARRY KIM: Yeah!


332
0:12:0,704 --> 0:12:2,912



333
0:12:2,912 --> 0:12:4,41
DAVID CHOE: Wait, how are
you gonna get down?


334
0:12:4,41 --> 0:12:6,34
HARRY KIM: Slide.


335
0:12:6,34 --> 0:12:6,88
I don't know.


336
0:12:6,88 --> 0:12:8,3
It's easier to come up, man.


337
0:12:8,3 --> 0:12:9,212
DAVID CHOE: Come down.


338
0:12:9,212 --> 0:12:12,285
HARRY KIM: And there's like
nails all over this shit.


339
0:12:12,285 --> 0:12:13,96
Dude, I'm just gonna
slide, man.


340
0:12:13,96 --> 0:12:15,648
DAVID CHOE: You're not gonna--
you're gonna break your--


341
0:12:15,648 --> 0:12:17,384
HARRY KIM: Just catch me
when I get down there.


342
0:12:17,384 --> 0:12:19,6
DAVID CHOE: You're gonna break
your legs, you dipshit.


343
0:12:19,6 --> 0:12:24,12
Harry, grab the fucking line and
grapple down, you retard.


344
0:12:24,12 --> 0:12:26,2
Do you think there's a hospital
anywhere near here?


345
0:12:26,2 --> 0:12:26,684
Harry.


346
0:12:26,684 --> 0:12:28,62
Grab the fucking rope
and come down, man.


347
0:12:28,62 --> 0:12:29,588
Grapple down, bitch.


348
0:12:29,588 --> 0:12:31,806
HARRY KIM: I really don't want
to grapple down, man.


349
0:12:31,806 --> 0:12:32,96
DAVID CHOE: Get it
stuck on there.


350
0:12:32,96 --> 0:12:34,21
OK.


351
0:12:34,21 --> 0:12:52,15



352
0:12:52,15 --> 0:12:54,71
Good morning, America.


353
0:12:54,71 --> 0:12:57,686
It was a miserable
night in Alaska.


354
0:12:57,686 --> 0:13:1,38
We found out the only real
vampires out here are fucking


355
0:13:1,38 --> 0:13:3,2
mosquitoes.


356
0:13:3,2 --> 0:13:6,13
I took a piss last night
next to Harry.


357
0:13:6,13 --> 0:13:7,96
We got no less than
four mosquitoes


358
0:13:7,96 --> 0:13:10,26
bites each on our cocks.


359
0:13:10,26 --> 0:13:13,606
Our cocks are bumpy with
mosquito bites.


360
0:13:13,606 --> 0:13:18,53
The good side is they're now
ribbed for your pleasure.


361
0:13:18,53 --> 0:13:21,104
Meaning girls.


362
0:13:21,104 --> 0:13:22,832
Arrrr.


363
0:13:22,832 --> 0:13:24,78
[HISS]


364
0:13:24,78 --> 0:13:26,575
Fucking raining and miserable.


365
0:13:26,575 --> 0:13:28,635
We slept in a fucking
rusty shovel.


366
0:13:28,635 --> 0:13:31,23



367
0:13:31,23 --> 0:13:34,875
Fucking ride or die.


368
0:13:34,875 --> 0:13:37,35
HARRY KIM: [HISS]


369
0:13:37,35 --> 0:14:7,58



370
0:14:7,58 --> 0:14:8,22
DAVID CHOE: Fuck, man.


371
0:14:8,22 --> 0:14:10,3
Nature's so beautiful.


372
0:14:10,3 --> 0:14:11,775
There's only one way
to catch a fish.


373
0:14:11,775 --> 0:14:13,74
That's with a fucking
ninja star.


374
0:14:13,74 --> 0:14:15,32
Welcome, America, to
Dave Choe's Death


375
0:14:15,32 --> 0:14:16,57
Star Training Camp.


376
0:14:16,57 --> 0:14:22,898



377
0:14:22,898 --> 0:14:23,89
HARRY KIM: Got it!


378
0:14:23,89 --> 0:14:24,386
I got one!


379
0:14:24,386 --> 0:14:26,866
I got one!


380
0:14:26,866 --> 0:14:28,85
DAVID CHOE: Unnh!


381
0:14:28,85 --> 0:14:29,842
HARRY KIM: Yeah!


382
0:14:29,842 --> 0:14:31,92
Yeahhhhhhhhhggh!


383
0:14:31,92 --> 0:14:41,25



384
0:14:41,25 --> 0:14:43,75
Arrrrrghghhhh.


385
0:14:43,75 --> 0:14:46,882
DAVID CHOE: This is how we
catch food out here.


386
0:14:46,882 --> 0:14:48,132
Fucking wilderness.


387
0:14:48,132 --> 0:15:32,18



388
0:15:32,18 --> 0:15:35,59
Look at this motherfucker.


389
0:15:35,59 --> 0:15:37,65
We're in the middle
of nowhere.


390
0:15:37,65 --> 0:15:42,41
I went fucking so far to get
this fucking ap-- hey, I was


391
0:15:42,41 --> 0:15:45,56
going to give this to you.


392
0:15:45,56 --> 0:15:48,33
Anyways, I went so far to get
this fucking apple and I'm


393
0:15:48,33 --> 0:15:51,255
starting to eat the apple, and
then this fucker shows up and


394
0:15:51,255 --> 0:15:53,56
he's all looking for food, so
I'm gonna give it to him.


395
0:15:53,56 --> 0:15:55,34
Hey, I'm going to give
you an apple.


396
0:15:55,34 --> 0:15:57,17
You don't want the apple?


397
0:15:57,17 --> 0:15:59,3
Moose!


398
0:15:59,3 --> 0:16:2,143
This'll be a delicious treat
for him when he gets it.


399
0:16:2,143 --> 0:16:4,39
I'm gonna try to throw
it next to him.


400
0:16:4,39 --> 0:16:5,15
Bullwinkle!


401
0:16:5,15 --> 0:16:6,866
Eat the apple.


402
0:16:6,866 --> 0:16:7,92
Eat the apple.


403
0:16:7,92 --> 0:16:9,615
It's good.


404
0:16:9,615 --> 0:16:10,51
Eat the apple.


405
0:16:10,51 --> 0:16:12,2
It's delicious.


406
0:16:12,2 --> 0:16:13,649
Eat the apple.


407
0:16:13,649 --> 0:16:15,98
I fucking gave you my apple.


408
0:16:15,98 --> 0:16:17,996



409
0:16:17,996 --> 0:16:21,11
Fuck the moose.


410
0:16:21,11 --> 0:16:24,78
We're relatively close to
a city called Fairbanks.

home for tonight.

Hopefully there's nothing
crazy going on in here.

Hello?

0:16:35,23 --> 0:16:36,596

0:17:18,373 --> 0:17:21,73
Um, the whole "Thumbs Up" crew
has not been really taking


437
0:17:21,73 --> 0:17:23,339
care of themselves, health
and food-wise.


438
0:17:23,339 --> 0:17:28,569

cameraman and the crew, have

0:17:34,84 --> 0:17:36,15
At least once.


442
0:17:36,15 --> 0:17:38,55
We've been mostly staying in
construction sites and


443
0:17:38,55 --> 0:17:40,78
abandoned warehouses.


444
0:17:40,78 --> 0:17:45,24
We stayed in a fucking crazy
rundown house that had a bunch


445
0:17:45,24 --> 0:17:48,426
of shit, like sleeping
bags and stuff.


446
0:17:48,426 --> 0:17:50,32
And it smelt like fungus.


447
0:17:50,32 --> 0:17:53,2

Harry's lungs, so.

of this amazing adventure

0:18:2,15 --> 0:18:4,69
to hunt down Santa Claus
in the North Pole.

0:18:4,69 --> 0:18:6,63

But who knows what the
day holds for us?

0:18:10,71 --> 0:18:12,31
We have no idea what
will happen.


455
0:18:12,31 --> 0:18:15,5
Everyone out here looks like
a scary Russian vampire.

0:18:15,5 --> 0:18:17,71
So we don't know what's
going to happen.


457

disappointed 'cause in 1984, I


573
0:23:8,79 --> 0:23:10,855
didn't get the present
that I wanted.

MRS. CLAUS: Oh, dear.


575
0:23:11,23 --> 0:23:12,26

that was probably the best

SANTA CLAUS: Well, I'm sorry.


578
0:23:14,57 --> 0:23:17,99
Maybe something happened
during the transit.


579
0:23:17,99 --> 0:23:19,71
Maybe I left it at the
next door neighbor's.


580
0:23:19,71 --> 0:23:20,92

Canada, and then we got to

0:24:2,835 --> 0:24:4,3
SANTA CLAUS: Thank you.


614
0:24:4,3 --> 0:24:5,47
DAVID CHOE: Are there
elves around?


615
0:24:5,47 --> 0:24:6,11
SANTA CLAUS: Not today.


616
0:24:6,11 --> 0:24:7,832
DAVID CHOE: Oh, OK.


617
0:24:7,832 --> 0:24:10,36
Love the belt buckle.


618
0:24:10,36 --> 0:24:14,8
Hey Santa, next time you're on
your sleigh and you see us


619
0:24:14,8 --> 0:24:15,2
guys on the side of the
road hitchhiking,


620
0:24:15,2 --> 0:24:16,147
can you pick us up?


621
0:24:16,147 --> 0:24:17,98
SANTA CLAUS: I'll do
that, I'll do that.


622
0:24:17,98 --> 0:24:19,98
DAVID CHOE: Thumbs up,
thumbs up, Santa.


623
0:24:19,98 --> 0:24:21,5
SANTA CLAUS: OK.


624
0:24:21,5 --> 0:24:22,26
Have a good one.


625
0:24:22,26 --> 0:24:22,514
DAVID CHOE: Thanks, Santa.


626
0:24:22,514 --> 0:24:23,63
Thanks for [INAUDIBLE].

0:24:23,63 --> 0:24:24,7
HARRY KIM: Thank you.


628
0:24:24,7 --> 0:24:27,1
SANTA CLAUS: You're welcome.


629
0:24:27,1 --> 0:24:29,24
DAVID CHOE: I'm like a little
bit, like starstruck.


630
0:24:29,24 --> 0:24:32,172
I feel like I just met Jesus
Christ or something.


631
0:24:32,172 --> 0:24:33,24
HARRY KIM: No, he's
a great guy.


632
0:24:33,24 --> 0:24:35,49
DAVID CHOE: That was
the real deal, man.


633
0:24:35,49 --> 0:24:39,435
I feel like such a jerk for
like, yelling at you, yelling


634
0:24:39,435 --> 0:24:43,88
at the Canadians, yelling
at anybody.


635
0:24:43,88 --> 0:24:45,8
I just want to be a better
person from now on.


636
0:24:45,8 --> 0:24:48,68



637
0:24:48,68 --> 0:24:52,94
Let's see how long it lasts.


638
0:24:52,94 --> 0:24:54,16
My feet are tired.


639
0:24:54,16 --> 0:24:56,12
HARRY KIM: Let's party with
Santa tonight, though.


640
0:24:56,12 --> 0:24:58,758
DAVID CHOE: My thumbs
are tired.


641
0:24:58,758 --> 0:25:0,654
It's time to go home.


642
0:25:0,654 --> 0:25:1,602
Let's head back home.


643
0:25:1,602 --> 0:25:3,97
HARRY KIM: I think we should
kick it for a little


644
0:25:3,97 --> 0:25:4,944
bit and then go.


645
0:25:4,944 --> 0:25:6,729
DAVID CHOE: Harry, I'm trying
to fucking do the ending


646
0:25:6,729 --> 0:25:7,866
monologue right now.


647
0:25:7,866 --> 0:25:9,814
Will you quit fucking
it up, dude?


648
0:25:9,814 --> 0:25:12,26
HARRY KIM: I think we should
do the fireworks here.


649
0:25:12,26 --> 0:25:13,75
DAVID CHOE: That--


650
0:25:13,75 --> 0:25:15,35
Jesus Christ, dude.


651
0:25:15,35 --> 0:25:17,4
We could just do all that shit
and edit it in later.


652
0:25:17,4 --> 0:25:18,95
Why do you keep interrupting
me, man?


653
0:25:18,95 --> 0:25:20,441
HARRY KIM: In front
of Santa Claus.


654
0:25:20,441 --> 0:25:21,435
DAVID CHOE: Fuck, man.


655
0:25:21,435 --> 0:25:21,932
Fuck you.


656
0:25:21,932 --> 0:25:23,182
Jesus.


657
0:25:23,182 --> 0:25:32,87



658
0:25:32,87 --> 0:25:34,652
Thumbs up, America.


659
0:25:34,652 --> 0:25:36,512
I'm sorry I yelled at you.


660
0:25:36,512 --> 0:25:40,44
I'm sorry I screamed at you.


661
0:25:40,44 --> 0:25:42,84
Thank you, Mexicans, for
showing us your dick.


662
0:25:42,84 --> 0:25:45,15
Mexicans, thanks for the corn.


663
0:25:45,15 --> 0:25:48,0
Thank you, America, for leaving
us alone in the


664
0:25:48,0 --> 0:25:50,39
backseat with your babies.


665
0:25:50,39 --> 0:25:52,56
Thank you for giving us rides.


666
0:25:52,56 --> 0:25:55,2
Thank you for giving
us plane rides.


667
0:25:55,2 --> 0:25:58,5
America, thanks for letting us
crash in your backyards.


668
0:25:58,5 --> 0:26:0,61
Thanks for making out with
Harry in every city.


669
0:26:0,61 --> 0:26:3,67



670
0:26:3,67 --> 0:26:5,18
Canadians, thanks for nothing.


671
0:26:5,18 --> 0:26:8,53
Thank you, America, for letting
us use your entire


672
0:26:8,53 --> 0:26:11,71
nation as a backdrop for the
most bitching music video, for


673
0:26:11,71 --> 0:26:14,92
me and Harry rockin'
the nation.


674
0:26:14,92 --> 0:26:16,24
America, we're tired.


675
0:26:16,24 --> 0:26:18,22
Thanks for riding
along with us.


676
0:26:18,22 --> 0:26:19,777
It's time to go home.


677
0:26:19,777 --> 0:26:25,3



678
0:26:25,3 --> 0:26:27,47
America, don't fuck
with Santa.


679
0:26:27,47 --> 0:26:30,6
He's got a huge fuckin' dong.


680
0:26:30,6 --> 0:26:30,9
I seen it.


681
0:26:30,9 --> 0:26:32,6
I seen it.


682
0:26:32,6 --> 0:26:34,818
Santa's got a huge
moose knucle.
