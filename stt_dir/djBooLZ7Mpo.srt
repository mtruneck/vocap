1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:16,137



2
0:0:16,137 --> 0:0:17,61
PATRICK O'DELL: What's up?


3
0:0:17,61 --> 0:0:18,99
This is day one--


4
0:0:18,99 --> 0:0:20,64
I guess day two of the trip.


5
0:0:20,64 --> 0:0:21,845
First day of skating.


6
0:0:21,845 --> 0:0:24,3
We're in Medford, Oregon.


7
0:0:24,3 --> 0:0:26,79
I noticed the Anti-Hero team
was up at like 8:00 in the


8
0:0:26,79 --> 0:0:29,59
morning or something,
ready to skate.


9
0:0:29,59 --> 0:0:31,3
The Girl team rolled
in about noon.


10
0:0:31,3 --> 0:0:36,1



11
0:0:36,1 --> 0:0:38,592
Mike, I noticed Girls slept in
later than Anti-Hero today.


12
0:0:38,592 --> 0:0:41,235



13
0:0:41,235 --> 0:0:42,526
MIKE CARROLL: Beauty rest.


14
0:0:42,526 --> 0:0:49,656



15
0:0:49,656 --> 0:0:52,665
It's kind of pretty unreal
watching [INAUDIBLE]


16
0:0:52,665 --> 0:0:53,22
skate around.


17
0:0:53,22 --> 0:0:54,36
I've never seen anything
like it.


18
0:0:54,36 --> 0:0:55,6
PATRICK O'DELL: It's
pretty sick.


19
0:0:55,6 --> 0:0:56,76
MIKE CARROLL: Everyone's
rippin'.


20
0:0:56,76 --> 0:0:57,87
MALE SPEAKER: That
is beautiful.


21
0:0:57,87 --> 0:0:59,995
MALE SPEAKER: This is called
Touch of Sparkle.


22
0:0:59,995 --> 0:1:2,82



23
0:1:2,82 --> 0:1:4,769
MALE SPEAKER: Maybe the
[INAUDIBLE] rock tail stall


24
0:1:4,769 --> 0:1:5,56
combo again.


25
0:1:5,56 --> 0:1:6,81
MALE SPEAKER: You gotta
complete it now.


26
0:1:6,81 --> 0:1:12,6



27
0:1:12,6 --> 0:1:14,54
There she goes.


28
0:1:14,54 --> 0:1:16,515
PATRICK O'DELL: I don't know, I
think we're going to go to a


29
0:1:16,515 --> 0:1:17,88
bunch of parks today.


30
0:1:17,88 --> 0:1:20,854
Julien's tourguiding, so we'll
see where he takes us.


31
0:1:20,854 --> 0:1:21,311
That's it.


32
0:1:21,311 --> 0:1:21,77
I don't know.


33
0:1:21,77 --> 0:1:23,2
Skate day.


34
0:1:23,2 --> 0:1:34,41



35
0:1:34,41 --> 0:1:36,48
MALE SPEAKER: What's
it about, helmets?


36
0:1:36,48 --> 0:1:37,926
MALE SPEAKER: I guess.


37
0:1:37,926 --> 0:1:41,3



38
0:1:41,3 --> 0:1:42,746
What the hell?


39
0:1:42,746 --> 0:1:46,12



40
0:1:46,12 --> 0:1:48,6
MAX SCHAAF: Skate at
your own risk.


41
0:1:48,6 --> 0:1:48,94
POLICE OFFICER: OK,

42
0:1:48,94 --> 0:1:50,38
MAX SCHAAF: Know
your abilities.


43
0:1:50,38 --> 0:1:51,73
POLICE OFFICERS: How about,
approved helmets


44
0:1:51,73 --> 0:1:52,575
required at all times?


45
0:1:52,575 --> 0:1:53,925
MAX SCHAAF: Even for
grown ups, hey?


46
0:1:53,925 --> 0:1:54,86
POLICE OFFICER: Doesn't say.


47
0:1:54,86 --> 0:1:56,7
So that means yeah.


48
0:1:56,7 --> 0:1:58,428
MAX SCHAAF: Well.


49
0:1:58,428 --> 0:2:0,52
See ya.


50
0:2:0,52 --> 0:2:2,514
POLICE OFFICER: You're
trespassed from the property,


51
0:2:2,514 --> 0:2:3,786
so you need to leave.


52
0:2:3,786 --> 0:2:4,925
So I'm following you.


53
0:2:4,925 --> 0:2:6,5
PATRICK O'DELL: Why's that?


54
0:2:6,5 --> 0:2:6,96
POLICE OFFICER: 'Cause
there's no


55
0:2:6,96 --> 0:2:8,26
skateboarding without helmets.


56
0:2:8,26 --> 0:2:10,686
PATRICK O'DELL: I'm
not skating.


57
0:2:10,686 --> 0:2:12,4
POLICE OFFICER: But
you're trespassed.


58
0:2:12,4 --> 0:2:12,92
So you can go.


59
0:2:12,92 --> 0:2:14,0
PATRICK O'DELL: What
do you mean?


60
0:2:14,0 --> 0:2:14,73
I'm not trespassing,
I'm just--


61
0:2:14,73 --> 0:2:17,55
POLICE OFFICER: You can go.


62
0:2:17,55 --> 0:2:20,5
JOHN CARDIEL: He came in
kind of hot, right?


63
0:2:20,5 --> 0:2:22,99
You know license expired,
where's your helmets at, who's


64
0:2:22,99 --> 0:2:23,5
the driver of the vehicle?


65
0:2:23,5 --> 0:2:25,4
It's like, fuck you, dude.


66
0:2:25,4 --> 0:2:26,8
MALE SPEAKER: Give me one
problem at a time.


67
0:2:26,8 --> 0:2:26,84
JOHN CARDIEL: Right.


68
0:2:26,84 --> 0:2:28,351
MAX SCHAAF: You know, John, how
whenever they come up, you


69
0:2:28,351 --> 0:2:29,31
go, gentlemen.


70
0:2:29,31 --> 0:2:30,35
You know, they say gentlemen?


71
0:2:30,35 --> 0:2:31,2
JOHN CARDIEL: Right, right.


72
0:2:31,2 --> 0:2:32,34
MAX SCHAAF: He came up,
and I go, gentlemen.


73
0:2:32,34 --> 0:2:33,56
And he goes, start
your engines.


74
0:2:33,56 --> 0:2:34,368
JOHN CARDIEL: Wow.


75
0:2:34,368 --> 0:2:35,284

76
0:2:35,284 --> 0:2:36,2
JOHN CARDIEL: Beat it.


77
0:2:36,2 --> 0:2:37,5
MAX SCHAAF: Heard that one.


78
0:2:37,5 --> 0:2:40,47
JOHN CARDIEL: Kick rocks.


79
0:2:40,47 --> 0:2:42,375
MALE SPEAKER: That was sick,
did you see that?


80
0:2:42,375 --> 0:2:43,38
PATRICK O'DELL: What
did he do?


81
0:2:43,38 --> 0:2:46,4
MALE SPEAKER: Step hopped the
whole fucking island, dude.


82
0:2:46,4 --> 0:2:47,76
Film this shit, bro.


83
0:2:47,76 --> 0:2:53,712



84
0:2:53,712 --> 0:2:56,465
PATRICK O'DELL: It seemed like
with those two teams combined,


85
0:2:56,465 --> 0:2:58,67
there's somebody that could
skate anything.


86
0:2:58,67 --> 0:2:59,86
JOHN ALDEN: Yeah, yeah.


87
0:2:59,86 --> 0:3:0,6
Like a good spark.


88
0:3:0,6 --> 0:3:2,65
PATRICK O'DELL: Like it could be
a manual pad, or like a 13


89
0:3:2,65 --> 0:3:4,18
foot wall, that somebody
could go.


90
0:3:4,18 --> 0:3:5,9
JOHN ALDEN: Yeah.


91
0:3:5,9 --> 0:3:5,59
Yeah.


92
0:3:5,59 --> 0:3:7,51
It was rad.


93
0:3:7,51 --> 0:3:8,76
Well rounded crew.


94
0:3:8,76 --> 0:3:11,362



95
0:3:11,362 --> 0:3:13,25
FRANK GERWER: What was one of
your favorite parts of the


96
0:3:13,25 --> 0:3:14,84
tour, O'Dell?


97
0:3:14,84 --> 0:3:15,8
Let me see that.


98
0:3:15,8 --> 0:3:18,3
PATRICK O'DELL: All my favorite
things are swimming


99
0:3:18,3 --> 0:3:19,59
spots and scenic--


100
0:3:19,59 --> 0:3:19,89
JOHN ALDEN: Yeah.


101
0:3:19,89 --> 0:3:21,22
PATRICK O'DELL: Remember
when we went to


102
0:3:21,22 --> 0:3:22,3
that cold rock river?


103
0:3:22,3 --> 0:3:24,53
JOHN ALDEN: The first one, like
when we started driving


104
0:3:24,53 --> 0:3:24,96
through that field?


105
0:3:24,96 --> 0:3:25,71
PATRICK O'DELL: It was
freezing cold.


106
0:3:25,71 --> 0:3:27,12
JOHN ALDEN: Like the first
one we went to?


107
0:3:27,12 --> 0:3:28,45
PATRICK O'DELL: I really
liked that.


108
0:3:28,45 --> 0:3:29,1
JOHN ALDEN: Yeah.


109
0:3:29,1 --> 0:3:30,1
PATRICK O'DELL: It
was like ice.


110
0:3:30,1 --> 0:3:31,1
JOHN ALDEN: Yeah.


111
0:3:31,1 --> 0:3:31,86
It was hella cold.


112
0:3:31,86 --> 0:3:33,286
PATRICK O'DELL: Because I think
it was like melted snow.


113
0:3:33,286 --> 0:3:40,118



114
0:3:40,118 --> 0:3:42,93
MALE SPEAKER: Ah, come on.


115
0:3:42,93 --> 0:3:43,57
MALE SPEAKER: Keystone.


116
0:3:43,57 --> 0:3:46,67
This river's good for keeping
the beer's cold.


117
0:3:46,67 --> 0:3:48,675
Throw 'em right there
at the base.


118
0:3:48,675 --> 0:3:51,465



119
0:3:51,465 --> 0:3:53,325
MALE SPEAKER: Pretty potent.


120
0:3:53,325 --> 0:3:56,475
Pretty potent and brisk.


121
0:3:56,475 --> 0:3:58,399
FRANK GERWER: Fuck,
that sucked.


122
0:3:58,399 --> 0:4:2,247



123
0:4:2,247 --> 0:4:6,208
MALE SPEAKER: Good way
to wake up, Patrick.


124
0:4:6,208 --> 0:4:6,69
[SMACK]


125
0:4:6,69 --> 0:4:9,1
MALE SPEAKER: See

126
0:4:9,1 --> 0:4:10,385
MALE SPEAKER: It didn't
even hit anything.


127
0:4:10,385 --> 0:4:11,55
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, it did.


128
0:4:11,55 --> 0:4:11,815

0:4:11,815 --> 0:4:13,65
Take it.

0:4:13,65 --> 0:4:16,301



131
0:4:16,301 --> 0:4:18,566

135
0:4:27,577 --> 0:4:28,451
What are we doing?


136
0:4:28,451 --> 0:4:29,762
ROBBIE RUSSO: I don't know.


137
0:4:29,762 --> 0:4:30,84

138
0:4:30,84 --> 0:4:31,39
JOHN CARDIEL: What do
you want to do?


139
0:4:31,39 --> 0:4:35,206
ROBBIE RUSSO: All I got
is big bills now.


140
0:4:35,206 --> 0:4:39,35
JOHN CARDIEL: Come on,

141
0:4:39,35 --> 0:4:42,63

0:4:46,41 --> 0:4:47,52
JOHN CARDIEL: That's real talk.


146
0:4:47,52 --> 0:4:49,404
Real talk.


147
0:4:49,404 --> 0:4:52,23
MALE SPEAKER: John's taking
little kids' money and shit.


148
0:4:52,23 --> 0:4:55,7
JOHN CARDIEL: Don't look
at me like that, Rick.


149
0:4:55,7 --> 0:4:57,0
I just felt bad, dude.


150
0:4:57,0 --> 0:4:59,4
Rick looked at me
like, bad, bad.


151
0:4:59,4 --> 0:5:2,4
That was all.


152
0:5:2,4 --> 0:5:4,18
PRESTON MAIGETTER: How's
it going, Pat?


153
0:5:4,18 --> 0:5:5,963

154
0:5:5,963 --> 0:5:7,18
PRESTON MAIGETTER: Uh,

0:5:7,18 --> 0:5:8,21

0:5:9,68 --> 0:5:10,93
PRESTON MAIGETTER: Yeah.


158
0:5:10,93 --> 0:5:17,648

160
0:5:19,265 --> 0:5:20,135
ROBBIE RUSSO: John?


161
0:5:20,135 --> 0:5:21,5
PATRICK O'DELL: Yeah.


162
0:5:21,5 --> 0:5:22,51

0:5:22,51 --> 0:5:25,11
PATRICK O'DELL: Yeah.


164
0:5:25,11 --> 0:5:26,68
This is the third
park of the day.


165
0:5:26,68 --> 0:5:29,76
Brookings, Oregon.


166
0:5:29,76 --> 0:5:32,37
The park where Cardiel did
the back side 360,


167
0:5:32,37 --> 0:5:34,41
and over the bowl.


168
0:5:34,41 --> 0:5:36,7
Megajump over the bowl.


169
0:5:36,7 --> 0:5:38,884



170
0:5:38,884 --> 0:5:41,698
And now everyone else is
trying to get some.


171
0:5:41,698 --> 0:5:43,11
It's pretty sweet.


172
0:5:43,11 --> 0:5:43,76
MALE SPEAKER: I give it a go.


173
0:5:43,76 --> 0:5:46,88
MALE SPEAKER: It's like a
fucking ski jump, dude.


174
0:5:46,88 --> 0:5:48,13
It's insane.


175
0:5:48,13 --> 0:5:54,452



176
0:5:54,452 --> 0:5:56,0
PATRICK O'DELL: What's
the secret, John?


177
0:5:56,0 --> 0:5:59,98
JOHN CARDIEL: The
secret is speed.


178
0:5:59,98 --> 0:6:1,23
And a lot.


179
0:6:1,23 --> 0:6:3,838



180
0:6:3,838 --> 0:6:4,89
PATRICK O'DELL: And a lot.

187
0:6:25,4 --> 0:6:28,872



188
0:6:28,872 --> 0:6:30,288
A little icing on the cake.


189
0:6:30,288 --> 0:6:31,704
Put it up on an arm.


190
0:6:31,704 --> 0:6:35,8



191
0:6:35,8 --> 0:6:36,66
PATRICK O'DELL: Can't turn
back once you're all in.


192
0:6:36,66 --> 0:6:37,99
You have to do it.


193
0:6:37,99 --> 0:6:38,82
You have to [INAUDIBLE].


194
0:6:38,82 --> 0:6:40,52
MALE SPEAKER: What happens
then when you do?


195
0:6:40,52 --> 0:6:41,58
Just fucking cruise, right?


196
0:6:41,58 --> 0:6:42,39
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.


197
0:6:42,39 --> 0:6:43,866
Keep cruisin'.

Just go fast.


199
0:6:44,85 --> 0:6:46,515
MALE SPEAKER: No turning back.


200
0:6:46,515 --> 0:7:37,56



201
0:7:37,56 --> 0:7:39,3
JOHN CARDIEL: Come on,
Robbie, come on.


202
0:7:39,3 --> 0:7:41,19
Come on, come on, Robbie.


203
0:7:41,19 --> 0:7:43,15
Ahh!


204
0:7:43,15 --> 0:7:44,58
You know you want to, Robbie.


205
0:7:44,58 --> 0:7:45,68
Give it all the juice.


206
0:7:45,68 --> 0:7:47,84
ROBBIE RUSSO: I'm just scared
of [INAUDIBLE], man.


207
0:7:47,84 --> 0:7:48,69
JOHN CARDIEL: You'll
make it across.


208
0:7:48,69 --> 0:7:49,66
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah,
you got it.


209
0:7:49,66 --> 0:7:51,56
FRANK GERWER: We'll all
blow at the same time.


210
0:7:51,56 --> 0:7:52,59
We'll go, phew.


211
0:7:52,59 --> 0:7:53,495
JOHN CARDIEL: You'll make it.


212
0:7:53,495 --> 0:7:55,641
ROBBIE RUSSO: Ehh.


213
0:7:55,641 --> 0:7:57,38
MALE SPEAKER: You got
it, Rob, you got it.


214
0:7:57,38 --> 0:7:58,44
MALE SPEAKER: Once you roll
in, it's over with.


215
0:7:58,44 --> 0:7:59,365
You got it.


216
0:7:59,365 --> 0:8:0,615
Just do it.


217
0:8:0,615 --> 0:8:4,31



218
0:8:4,31 --> 0:8:7,15
ROBBIE RUSSO: I'm just scared
of [INAUDIBLE].


219
0:8:7,15 --> 0:8:10,704
JOHN CARDIEL: You won't
not make it over, Rob.


220
0:8:10,704 --> 0:8:12,93
FRANK GERWER: All right,
come one, Robbie.


221
0:8:12,93 --> 0:8:15,3
Fly the chasm.


222
0:8:15,3 --> 0:8:16,79
ROBBIE RUSSO: Scared [INAUDIBLE]
isn't it?


223
0:8:16,79 --> 0:8:18,4
JOHN CARDIEL: Fly the chasm.


224
0:8:18,4 --> 0:8:31,922



225
0:8:31,922 --> 0:8:33,386
MALE SPEAKER: Whoo!


226
0:8:33,386 --> 0:8:34,86
RICK MCCRANK: Let's do it.


227
0:8:34,86 --> 0:8:36,664
You can roll in anything.


228
0:8:36,664 --> 0:8:37,62
You could jump it.


229
0:8:37,62 --> 0:8:38,555
Right here.


230
0:8:38,555 --> 0:8:41,914
Right here.


231
0:8:41,914 --> 0:8:43,902
ROBBIE RUSSO: Ohh, shit.


232
0:8:43,902 --> 0:8:45,552
PATRICK O'DELL: If you don't do
it, you're going to regret


233
0:8:45,552 --> 0:8:46,22
it the whole trip.


234
0:8:46,22 --> 0:8:46,86
ROBBIE RUSSO: I know.


235
0:8:46,86 --> 0:8:47,19
Fuck.


236
0:8:47,19 --> 0:8:47,42
PATRICK O'DELL: You're
going to want to


237
0:8:47,42 --> 0:8:48,38
come back here tomorrow.


238
0:8:48,38 --> 0:8:51,42
ROBBIE RUSSO: I should
just do it.


239
0:8:51,42 --> 0:8:52,21
Fuck.


240
0:8:52,21 --> 0:8:53,49
I'm just being--


241
0:8:53,49 --> 0:8:55,388
I'm scared.


242
0:8:55,388 --> 0:8:58,26
That's all it is.


243
0:8:58,26 --> 0:8:58,92
It's my mind.


244
0:8:58,92 --> 0:8:59,46
PATRICK O'DELL: Well,
you got it.


245
0:8:59,46 --> 0:9:0,33
I'm watching you skate.


246
0:9:0,33 --> 0:9:1,71
And it seems like you got
the board control


247
0:9:1,71 --> 0:9:3,69
to just launch over.


248
0:9:3,69 --> 0:9:22,5



249
0:9:22,5 --> 0:9:23,255
MALE SPEAKER: Whoo!


250
0:9:23,255 --> 0:9:30,333



251
0:9:30,333 --> 0:9:31,583
Whoo!


252
0:9:31,583 --> 0:9:44,743



253
0:9:44,743 --> 0:9:46,4
PATRICK O'DELL: What
about Julien?


254
0:9:46,4 --> 0:9:47,703
Had you seen him skate
in person?


255
0:9:47,703 --> 0:9:49,51
ALEX OLSON: No.


256
0:9:49,51 --> 0:9:51,34
He wouldn't skate that much.


257
0:9:51,34 --> 0:9:55,13
Or he would, but he'd be trying
something, and everyone


258
0:9:55,13 --> 0:9:56,5
would sit down and start
watching it.


259
0:9:56,5 --> 0:9:57,6
And he'd be like, be over it.


260
0:9:57,6 --> 0:10:0,4
He's kind of like [INAUDIBLE]
in that sense.


261
0:10:0,4 --> 0:10:5,21
Like, doing his own thing, and
once five people notice it,


262
0:10:5,21 --> 0:10:6,21
he's like, oh fuck.


263
0:10:6,21 --> 0:10:7,46
I'm over it.


264
0:10:7,46 --> 0:10:10,71



265
0:10:10,71 --> 0:10:13,198
PATRICK O'DELL: Do you
like how he skates?


266
0:10:13,198 --> 0:10:14,7
ALEX OLSON: Oh yeah.


267
0:10:14,7 --> 0:10:15,32
He's one of my favorites.


268
0:10:15,32 --> 0:10:25,95



269
0:10:25,95 --> 0:12:25,95
