###7 ALICE ROBERTS: They say this is where it all began.
###12 (PEOPLE CHATTERING)
###13 That we are all children of Africa.
###20 But if so, why do we look so different?
###26 And how on earth could a handful of African families
###30 become a whole world full of people?
###45 I'm Alice Roberts, medical doctor and anthropologist.
###49 I'm fascinated by what bones,
###53 stones,
###55 and even our bodies can reveal about the distant past.
###63 I'm going in search of where the first people were born
###67 and how they began their journey to populate the world.
###73 Leaving Africa was virtually impossible,
###78 but new evidence suggests just one tiny group might have done it.
###83 I just think it's absolutely remarkable.
###85 Isn't that amazing? It's stunning.
###89 Can I find their trail out of Africa and across the world?
###94 And discover how those journeys changed them
###98 to become who we are today?
###103 Come With me in the footsteps of our ancestors
###106 on the most epic adventure ever undertaken.
###121 (INDISTINCT RADIO EXCHANGE)
###132 ROBERTS: Ask yourself where do you come from?
###136 How did the first humans become you?
###140 It's a surprisingly tricky question.
###145 And in search of an answer, I'm starting in East Africa.
###150 I've dreamt about coming to this place since I Was a teenager.
###167 As unlikely as it sounds, palaeontologists
###169 noW think We have a pretty good idea
###172 of Where We modern humans first appeared.
###175 And I'm trying to get there.
###177 But it is in one of the most remote parts of the continent.
###196 I'm heading to Africa's great Rift Valley
###199 and the Omo River in Ethiopia.
###212 Very feW foreigners ever come here.
###216 (PEOPLE CHATTERING)
###222 The place I'm trying to reach lies on the far western side of the Omo.
###229 There are no bridges for hundreds of miles,
###232 so my best option is the slightly leaky passenger ferry.
###239 Past the crocodiles.
###269 There's quite a Welcoming committee.
###273 -Hello. -Hello.
###280 (LAUGHING)
###284 (INDISTINCT CHATTERING)
###300 I'm looking for the route taken by a scientific expedition
###304 about 40 years ago.
###310 They stumbled across perhaps the most important clue
###314 about the beginning of our species.
###320 I've got map coordinates, but there are no obvious tracks to follow.
###328 I think What I'm going to do is head to Kibish, the nearest village,
###332 and get some local help.
###339 (INDISTINCT CHATTERING)
###360 Kibish is home to the Nyangatom tribe.
###363 Soya, salaam.
###365 HoW are you? Mata.
###366 -I'm Well. HoW are you? -Mata. Mata.
###368 I'm fine.
###373 -I need to find a very particular place. -Mmm-hmm.
###377 ROBERTS: My only chance of help is if the chief agrees.
###381 -Mata. -Mata.
###384 (SPEAKING EASTERN NILOTIC LANGUAGE)
###389 Soya, can you tell him Why I'm here?
###391 Can you say that I'm here to find the place
###393 Where people Were digging?
###395 (SPEAKING EASTERN NILOTIC LANGUAGE)
###411 This all sounds very promising.
###416 -He said someone Was digging. -Someone Was digging.
###419 -And he found something like bone. -Yes.
###422 And, I don't knoW, he say the bone that stayed there for long time.
###427 When can We go? Can you ask them?
###429 (SPEAKING EASTERN NILOTIC LANGUAGE)
###432 -Let's go noW. -We can go noW?
###447 ROBERTS: I'm not sure that these guys know where they're going,
###453 but they seem to have come prepared for something.
###456 And, uh, Why's he carrying a gun?
###458 (SPEAKING EASTERN NILOTIC LANGUAGE)
###464 For protection.
###466 -For protection from Whom? -For protection from enemies.
###469 -Right. -Like Surma, Turkana and Mursi.
###474 -So these are other tribes? -Yeah, the other tribes.
###477 Are they likely to attack us?
###479 (SPEAKING EASTERN NILOTIC LANGUAGE)
###482 Yeah, they just come to attack them.
###485 -So there's alWays fighting going on? -Yeah, they alWays fighting.
###487 Right.
###497 ROBERTS: It's noon and the temperature has soared into the 40s.
###512 Although I've wanted to come here for years,
###515 after four hours in this searing heat
###518 I'm not sure I'm going to make it.
###524 (SPEAKING EASTERN NILOTIC LANGUAGE)
###527 -So What are they saying? -They say it's there.
###529 -Really? -Yeah.
###530 -That's Where it Was found? -Yeah, it is there.
###532 -Just here? -Yeah.
###533 -Just there? -Just there.
###553 Well, this is it. This is the place.
###556 Because this is Where the earliest human remains
###561 in the entire World Were discovered.
###564 It's been really difficult to find it. It's taken us four hours to Walk here
###568 and We've been a circuitous route through the bush.
###571 And it seems really strange that there's nothing to mark it.
###576 Because this is such an important place in our story.
###582 And it's as close as I can get
###585 to Where We all began.
###589 Amazing.
###603 And this is what the archaeologists discovered.
###609 This is a cast of the skull that Was found here
###613 and Which Was dated to 195,000 years ago.
###618 I think, considering it's so old,
###620 it's remarkably complete.
###622 Okay, the fragile face bones are missing,
###625 but most of the brain case is here.
###626 We can see the size of the brain
###629 and We can see this very characteristic forehead.
###634 No other remains of our species even approaching this age
###638 have been found anywhere else on the planet.
###649 This is as near as we can get
###651 to the origin of our species.
###661 There's something very special about sitting here looking out at the Omo.
###666 I could be on the banks of any African river,
###669 apart from the fact We knoW that this landscape
###673 has been home to humans, people like you and me,
###677 for nearly 200,000 years.
###684 So if this is where we first appeared,
###688 what did we come from?
###693 The evidence suggests that the very first human-like creatures
###697 evolved in Africa over four million years ago.
###702 They were much more ape-like than us.
###705 A series of human species with gradually bigger brains
###709 came and went.
###712 The most recent, and only surviving,
###715 is our own species, Homo sapiens.
###719 Modern humans.
###728 Here is a skull of one of our nearest ancient human relatives,
###732 Homo heidelbergensis.
###734 If We compare it With this modern skull,
###737 some things just leap out at you.
###740 This heidelbergensis skull has an enormous broW ridge
###743 and a sWept-back, sloping forehead.
###747 Much steeper in the modern skull.
###749 In fact, the Whole brain case here is much rounder.
###755 Using the skull of the ancient human,
###758 experts have reconstructed his face,
###763 to reveal our flatter-headed,
###765 beetle-browed predecessor.
###773 In contrast With this reconstruction of a very old but modern human,
###780 and I think you'll agree that she looks a lot more like me.
###788 But if East Africa is where the first humans were born,
###792 there are some big questions to answer.
###799 Are we all descended from black Africans?
###803 If so, why do most of us look so different?
###815 And how could a handful of people from such an isolated place
###820 go on to colonise first Africa
###824 and then the rest of the world?
###834 So what do we know about these shadowy first families?
###840 200,000 years ago,
###842 it's likely there were so few of them, living such a precarious existence,
###848 that today they'd be classified as an endangered species.
###854 Life was fragile.
###857 And the African savannah was a dangerous place.
###881 Well, I'm going to be spending the night out here in the bush -
###884 presumably something our ancestors did all the time,
###887 but years of living in civilisation have softened me.
###892 I've got a big torch here, so that if anything comes by
###896 I can get a better look at it in the dark.
###898 And I've got this little camera
###901 so I can make a video diary throughout the night
###904 and talk about What comes along.
###908 I'm doing this for real, I'm going to be out here all night.
###910 And I really am quite scared.
###924 The film crew head for the safety of our camp, over ten kilometres away,
###930 leaving me with just a few thorn bushes for protection.
###942 (WHISPERING) It's just amazing the amount of noises you suddenly hear.
###945 About half an hour ago, there Was the sound,
###948 a really distinct sound, of something lapping Water.
###952 Maybe a hyena, maybe a leopard - it sounded like a big cat.
###956 Literally like a cat lapping at milk.
###961 Hopefully nothing can get through that.
###965 (SIGHING)
###971 Suddenly feel really vulnerable, as an animal
###974 Which is designed to be out in the daylight.
###978 I mean, can't see very Well at night.
###981 Hearing's all right. Just about enough to get you feeling scared.
###987 And sense of smell as Well -
###990 compared to all these other animals, might as Well not have it.
###1000 (ANIMAL CALLING)
###1001 Did you hear that?
###1005 I'm scared noW.
###1007 (ANIMAL CALLING)
###1012 (ANIMAL CALLING)
###1015 Is that a... Is that a lion?
###1018 Is that a leopard?
###1020 (ANIMAL CALLING)
###1026 Is that...
###1027 (ANIMAL CALLING)
###1029 Is that a hyena?
###1033 (ANIMAL CALLING)
###1037 Oh, I don't like that noise.
###1040 That's really spooky.
###1042 (ANIMAL CALLING)
###1053 That's got to be one of the most frightening nights of my life.
###1059 I did get some sleep,
###1061 but then I got Woken up by these horrendous noises.
###1065 Sometimes it Was hyenas.
###1067 And then there Was something that sounded
###1070 like a standoff betWeen a hyena and a leopard
###1072 or some... I don't knoW What it Was. AWful noises.
###1076 Really, really scary.
###1086 With the return of the crew, I pluck up my courage
###1090 and look for signs of the animals that I heard in the night.
###1098 God, just look at this. This is a big, male leopard paW print.
###1103 And there are large hyena prints as Well.
###1108 So these predators, these carnivores,
###1111 Were literally here, about 25 metres aWay
###1113 from Where I Was sleeping,
###1116 underneath that tree.
###1118 They sounded really close during the night.
###1121 And I can see noW that they Were.
###1131 At night-time especially,
###1132 our ancestors must have been very vulnerable.
###1137 So how did those first families survive,
###1141 let alone go on to spread across the world?
###1155 In the hope of finding out more, I'm heading south to Namibia.
###1172 I'm meeting one of the last groups of hunter-gatherers on this continent,
###1177 the Bushmen of the Kalahari.
###1181 -What's your name? -My name is Sedray.
###1183 -Sedray? -Sedray.
###1189 (COUGHING)
###1191 Their Way of life is the closest I can find to that of our ancestors.
###1198 (SPEAKING KHOISAN LANGUAGE)
###1201 The Bushmen are expert hunters.
###1207 But before I see hoW they do it,
###1210 I Want to persuade Un and Lau to take part in a little experiment.
###1215 Un, I need to check your body temperature using this.
###1220 Is that all right? I'm going to put it in your ear, like that.
###1223 -Yeah. -Stick it in your ear.
###1224 -Mmm-hmm. -Right. Just going to pop it in there.
###1231 (THERMOMETER BEEPING)
###1232 Lovely.
###1234 -36.2 -HoW is it?
###1237 -That's hoW hot you are. -There's my ears.
###1239 -Yes. -Okay.
###1240 And Lau, I need to do it to you as Well.
###1242 There We go, it's ready to take your temperature.
###1246 (THERMOMETER BEEPING)
###1248 Right. 35.8.
###1251 So you're even cooler. You're very cool.
###1257 (LAUGHING)
###1259 It's turned into a competition.
###1273 Humans usually hunt in the day.
###1275 So I want to see how our bodies cope with this blazing heat.
###1279 It's a pretty relentless pace.
###1283 We're looking for the trail of an antelope.
###1295 What have you found?
###1298 (SPEAKING KHOISAN LANGUAGE)
###1302 (WHISPERING) Oh, yeah. Right, this is really exciting.
###1304 We've got an oryx track. And We're going to folloW it.
###1308 I'm going to have to be really quiet noW.
###1318 We've got to move fast to gain on the oryx.
###1330 We've been walking and running for over an hour, when we find more prints.
###1336 But not the ones we were hoping for.
###1341 (SPEAKING KHOISAN LANGUAGE)
###1343 I think We give up the chase at this point.
###1345 The animal's being chased by a hyena.
###1347 Don't knoW if it'll live to tell the tale, either.
###1350 But no dinner for us.
###1355 It's now just past midday and the temperature is in the high 30s.
###1360 So what effect has all this running in the heat
###1362 had on our body temperatures?
###1366 Uh, 37.4, so a bit hotter than you Were before.
###1370 If I could try you as Well.
###1373 (THERMOMETER BEEPING)
###1374 Ooh, 36.7. Cooler than him.
###1378 (LAUGHING)
###1379 All right, What about me?
###1385 (THERMOMETER BEEPING)
###1386 Thanks. 36.9!
###1388 -Ohh! -We beat him.
###1390 Incredibly, our temperatures have barely risen.
###1393 Well, the key to this is that We're all regulating our body temperatures
###1396 even in this heat.
###1403 And this is the secret.
###1405 We keep cool by sweating.
###1407 Something humans do more effectively than most mammals.
###1412 Not having fur, we can sweat from glands all over our bodies,
###1418 which allows us to keep moving in pursuit of prey for hours
###1422 without overheating.
###1426 Even in the middle of the day,
###1428 when most big predators are just trying to keep cool.
###1435 And there are other things about your body
###1438 designed specifically for running.
###1443 And this is one of them. Yes, it's a foot.
###1446 And it is brilliantly designed to provide spring.
###1450 The ligaments and tendons support the sprung arches of the foot
###1453 so that every time our foot hits the ground, the spring stores
###1457 and then releases energy, making running more efficient.
###1463 And there's a really important muscle in our bums.
###1467 Our gluteus maximus muscle is huge
###1470 and We hardly use it at all When We're Walking.
###1473 But it comes into its oWn When We run.
###1480 So all of these adaptations suggest that running,
###1484 especially over long distances,
###1486 Was really important to our early ancestors.
###1495 But there was something else
###1497 that may have really given our ancient ancestors the edge.
###1502 (SPEAKING KHOISAN LANGUAGE)
###1510 Language.
###1511 The ability to communicate and plan.
###1519 Red, yelloW, green.
###1521 HoW do you say it?
###1523 (SPEAKING KHOISAN LANGUAGE)
###1529 We don't know when people started to speak,
###1532 but there's evidence that languages like this, click languages,
###1536 may be the oldest in the world.
###1540 (SPEAKING KHOISAN LANGUAGE)
###1545 So it's possible that the first families sounded a bit like this.
###1550 It is an amazing language.
###1552 Every sentence is peppered With these clicks and tutting noises
###1556 that are consonants.
###1558 They're just very unlike any consonants that I'm used to pronouncing.
###1561 So I'm struggling With it.
###1563 So this is...
###1564 (SPEAKING KHOISAN LANGUAGE)
###1571 (LAUGHING)
###1572 See, I think it's easier to say yelloW.
###1579 And it's a type of language
###1581 that could have been crucial to our ancestors' survival.
###1586 It may be that these click languages have been around for so long
###1590 because they're particularly useful during hunting.
###1594 Apparently, When the Bushmen are stalking an animal,
###1596 they drop their voices to a Whisper
###1599 so they're talking almost entirely in clicks,
###1602 Which makes a lot of sense to me.
###1603 The clicks are high-pitched noises that don't travel far through the bush,
###1607 so the hunters aren't going to scare off their quarry.
###1611 (SPEAKING KHOISAN LANGUAGE)
###1621 Equipped with language and hunting skills, we flourished.
###1627 And began to do something else.. spread out.
###1632 We don't know for sure which routes they took,
###1635 but new evidence shows that very early on,
###1638 modern humans were living at the extreme southern edge of the continent.
###1647 I'm heading along the South African coast
###1651 to a place called Pinnacle Point.
###1658 Today it's a playground for the rich.
###1662 But during the construction of this golf course,
###1665 archaeologists discovered something amazing
###1668 deep beneath the fairway.
###1681 This could be the oldest knoWn dWelling of our species
###1685 anyWhere in the World.
###1692 -So this is Where you've been digging? -This is the oldest part of the cave.
###1697 And What are the dates here, then, as We go doWn through these layers?
###1700 Uh, these layers date from 130,000 to 167,000 years ago.
###1704 -It's just so incredibly ancient. -It's amazing.
###1707 Did you knoW hoW important What you Were excavating really Was?
###1712 Not until We got those dates.
###1714 But, yeah. Amazing, stunning.
###1723 ROBERTS: The evidence in this cave reveals that those ancient families
###1727 were behaving in ways quite unlike previous species of human.
###1734 Well, Kyle, that's not from this cave, is it? 'Cause I recognise this.
###1736 This is a hand axe, isn't it?
###1738 That's correct. NoW, that's more typical of What you Would find
###1740 from about a million and a half years ago to about 300,000 years ago.
###1744 So, What sort of thing Were you finding in the cave, then?
###1747 Okay, Well, tools like these.
###1749 Blades and points are much more typical of What We find in this cave.
###1753 Made on quartzite, locally available on the beach doWn here.
###1757 And in our oldest levels here, alongside these types of tools,
###1760 We also have these very small bladelet tools.
###1763 These are tiny.
###1765 What could such minute blades have been used for?
###1769 Obviously, these Weren't used just in your hand like this,
###1772 so hoW Would they have been used?
###1774 It's more likely that those Were set in some kind of a handle
###1777 to make a compound tool.
###1779 Maybe something more like this.
###1781 This is a series of small blades set into a handle for use as a knife.
###1786 Yes, I think that Would Work.
###1789 So you think that's hoW these stone tools Were used, then, as a knife?
###1792 Um, that's one possibility.
###1795 And it's also possible they Would have been used for hunting Weapons.
###1801 ROBERTS: Kyle and his team have discovered
###1803 you can make some lethal weapons with these bladelets.
###1807 This one looks particularly vicious, I think.
###1809 This is one interpretation of hoW
###1811 those small back blades might have been mounted.
###1817 The advantage to this Would be that there's these barbs
###1820 that Would prevent the tip from pulling out immediately,
###1823 um, and Would inflict a greater injury.
###1828 ROBERTS: So by 160,000 years ago,
###1832 those early resourceful families seem to have colonised much of Africa.
###1848 But what about the rest of the world?
###1852 How did some of those ancient wanderers get out of Africa
###1857 to become me, and perhaps you?
###1861 It's one of the most baffling mysteries of our origins.
###1875 Africa south of the Sahara is cut off from the rest of the planet.
###1883 To the west, south and east, ocean.
###1892 To the north, the vast deserts of the Sahara and Arabia.
###1901 So could there be another way
###1903 that people first appeared all over the world?
###1909 Did they, as some have suggested,
###1912 evolve separately on different continents?
###1915 It's a huge question.
###1922 A different branch of science
###1923 is beginning to provide very surprising answers.
###1927 To find out more, I've come to Cape Town.
###1933 Cape ToWn today is a World city With representatives of just about
###1937 every group and creed you can possibly imagine.
###1941 And every single one of these people unknoWingly carries inside them
###1945 a story of their ancient ancestors.
###1949 That's because, buried in the genes of each of us,
###1953 is an indelible record of our past.
###1959 By studying DNA from people all over the world,
###1963 geneticists are piecing together that ancient story.
###1969 Cape Town, a product of its colonial past,
###1972 has citizens who bring their own genetic stories
###1975 from every corner of the planet.
###1980 And the minute differences in their DNA provide clues
###1984 about the ancient migrations that led our species to colonise the world.
###1991 Thanks again, folks, for coming. This is the tree of humanity, okay?
###1996 ROBERTS: geneticist Raj Ramesar has used these differences
###2000 to help build a global family tree
###2003 by tracing genes down the female line.
###2008 Our modern genes are the branches of the tree,
###2011 and geneticists have followed them back in time to find our ancient roots.
###2018 The DNA of everyone alive today fits somewhere on this tree.
###2025 Although it's not always obvious exactly where you fit.
###2029 Steven, What about you?
###2030 Where do you think your maternal heritage stems from?
###2034 Probably southern Europe.
###2035 Um, just the Italian community, that's Where my family comes from.
###2038 Well, actually, you are on a European branch,
###2042 but you're on a European branch up here, and that's much more northern Europe.
###2045 So I'm very sorry, Steven, you're not Italian.
###2047 You're a Laplander.
###2050 But follow the branches back to the beginning
###2053 and the tree reveals that ultimately we all have our roots in the same place.
###2061 There's no question from the genetic data
###2063 that is generated on the people here,
###2065 as Well as other studies that have been done,
###2067 that humanity arose in Africa.
###2069 And that's Where the depth of this thick trunk illustrates
###2073 Where the majority of humanity can look for its roots.
###2076 So because We originated in Africa,
###2078 there's been more time for branches to develop here
###2081 -than there has been anyWhere else. -Yeah, that's a crucial point.
###2085 Humanity has spent most of its life in Africa.
###2089 I'm African?
###2090 (LAUGHING)
###2091 -Yes, my cousin. -We all are.
###2095 Absolutely.
###2096 It's only more recently that We see this aspect of the tree.
###2102 ROBERTS: But the really amazing thing
###2104 is what the tree tells us about those who left Africa.
###2111 You might expect lots of branches, lots of genetic lineages,
###2115 leaving Africa at different times.
###2120 But instead, the rest of the world connects back to Africa
###2125 through one thin branch.
###2129 What does that mean?
###2132 There Was a single branching out of Africa.
###2135 It amounts to, historically, a single band of individuals
###2139 leaving the African continent.
###2141 So that Was the original migration out of Africa that We can track With DNA.
###2147 From there, there Were branchings out in many different directions
###2150 into Europe, into the rest of Asia, Eurasia and to the north,
###2155 and then doWn to Australia and Japan
###2158 and ultimately to the Americas on the other side.
###2161 ROBERTS: geneticists across the world have come to the same conclusions..
###2165 everyone outside Africa descends from not many,
###2169 but just one tiny group of pioneers.
###2173 I just think it's absolutely remarkable.
###2176 Isn't that amazing? It's stunning. Yeah.
###2179 Oh, WoW, man.
###2189 ROBERTS: It may be that others tried, too.
###2192 But their descendants have not survived.
###2197 So the genetics tells us our species
###2200 made just one successful attempt to leave.
###2204 And this Wasn't a mass exodus.
###2206 It Was a small group of people taking one route out of Africa.
###2211 And everybody in the World today Who isn't African
###2214 is descended from that handful of people.
###2218 It's just mind-boggling to think hoW different the World Would be today
###2223 if it Weren't for that small group of pioneers.
###2227 And it begs the next question:
###2229 Which route did they take?
###2234 The genetics may be convincing, but the geography is a huge problem.
###2245 For these early families, deserts and oceans
###2248 would have been massive obstacles.
###2256 But we know they did it somehow.
###2263 From this map, I think there are perhaps four possible routes out of Africa.
###2268 Across the Straits of Gibraltar here, so a bit of a sea crossing,
###2273 from Tunisia up through Sicily and Italy -
###2275 even more sea to cross there -
###2277 doWn here across the mouth of the Red Sea,
###2280 but you'd need a boat for that, as Well.
###2284 Or here, through the Sahara and Sinai deserts.
###2288 Well, all of those routes have their challenges,
###2290 but We knoW that it Was just one of them that Was taken.
###2294 So Which one Was it?
###2302 It's a real puzzle.
###2304 But could it be that the world was different back then?
###2310 Well, there is a way to find out.
###2317 We've asked a team of Britain's leading climate scientists
###2320 to work out how the global environment has changed,
###2324 going back over thousands of years.
###2332 And the ansWer is in here.
###2334 With this climate computer, I can look at the changing environment over time.
###2339 Starting at 140,000 years ago, we're moving towards the present.
###2346 Forests and grasslands are green, and deserts light brown.
###2353 NoW, this is interesting.
###2355 1 25,000 years ago,
###2358 there's a change in the climate.
###2360 It's been very dry in this area and then suddenly it gets greener.
###2369 And the World's biggest, driest,
###2372 most impassable desert briefly blossoms.
###2386 For just a few thousand years,
###2389 the Sahara, Sinai and Arabian deserts
###2394 were lush and green.
###2399 So it looks like, 125,000 years ago,
###2404 it Would have been possible for our ancestors to have Walked
###2407 through the Sahara and leave Africa to the northeast.
###2414 I'm after some evidence that at least one band of pioneers
###2418 made it to the other side of the Sahara,
###2422 and through that northern exit to the rest of the world.
###2431 I'm on my way to Israel and the site of an intriguing discovery.
###2440 But one which may present as many questions as answers.
###2448 Back in the 1930s, an international team of archaeologists
###2453 was excavating here at Skhul Cave.
###2461 But it's What Was found outside the cave that Was really interesting.
###2465 The archaeologists dug doWn through one and half metres of soil just here,
###2470 finding masses and masses of stone tools.
###2474 But as they got doWn close to the bedrock,
###2477 they found something even more exciting -
###2480 human burials, 10 of them.
###2491 When the bones were dated, they were found to be about 100,000 years old,
###2498 the oldest modern human remains outside Africa.
###2508 The dates fit well with that greening of the Sahara.
###2514 So could these people be the pioneers I'm looking for,
###2518 whose descendants went on to populate the rest of the world?
###2528 Some of their remains are now kept in the Rockefeller Museum in Jerusalem.
###2539 This skeleton is incredibly Well-preserved.
###2543 And the main reason for that is that the bodies at Skhul
###2546 Weren't just left on the surface of the ground.
###2549 They Were deliberately buried.
###2552 And not only that, they Were buried With objects,
###2555 With shell beads, and one of them
###2558 even had a boar's jaW enclosed in its arms.
###2563 Surely this is further evidence for modern Ways of thinking and behaving,
###2569 for spirituality,
###2571 and perhaps even a belief in the afterlife.
###2585 But not everything here is what it seems.
###2590 These people may well have been the first to leave Africa,
###2593 but it looks like they can't be our ancestors.
###2598 Because the trail then dries up.
###2601 All evidence of modern humans disappears.
###2607 It looks like these families died out completely...
###2614 around 90,000 years ago,
###2617 when the Middle East and Sahara returned to desert
###2621 and life here became impossible.
###2636 For our species, it seems that this Was a dead end.
###2641 And it shoWs just hoW fragile our existence Was,
###2645 and What a massive impact climate change could have on a human population.
###2651 But it Wasn't the end of the human journey.
###2654 So Where Was that elusive route out of Africa?
###2662 The Sahara Desert once again closed the door on any migration north,
###2667 leaving just one of my four routes out of Africa, the Red Sea.
###2673 If they did try to cross it, the most likely point is at its mouth,
###2678 the gate of grief.
###2691 Could at least a few families have broken out of Africa here?
###2698 BeloW me is the Red Sea,
###2700 and to the West, the small African state of Djibouti.
###2704 And over to my east, I can just about make out the coast of Yemen
###2708 on the tip of the Arabian peninsula.
###2711 At this point, it is just 30 kilometres betWeen Africa and Arabia.
###2721 30 kilometres of sea is still a big problem
###2724 if you don't have a seagoing vessel.
###2728 But from about 90,000 years ago, something interesting began to happen.
###2736 The very same climate change that had turned the Sahara back to desert
###2741 had another impact.
###2743 It made sea levels drop.
###2749 And at the gate of grief, the gap between Africa and Arabia
###2755 became much smaller.
###2760 As sea levels fell, the distance across the Red Sea at this point
###2765 dropped to just 1 1 kilometres.
###2767 So perhaps, here at last, Was a chance to risk everything,
###2773 to cross the Gate of Grief and take a step into the unknoWn.
###2782 And geneticists working for this series have been able to estimate
###2787 how many people made that leap out of Africa,
###2791 whichever way they took.
###2798 They estimate the size of this group that made the crossing
###2801 from Africa to Arabia Was just a feW hundred people.
###2806 And geneticists have noW tested the DNA
###2808 of thousands and thousands of non-Africans,
###2812 and not one single person has been found Who can't trace their ancestry back
###2819 to this tiny group of Wanderers.
###2825 It may have been just a single tribe.
###2832 And whatever you look like, if you're not African,
###2836 you descend from them.
###2847 But getting beyond the Red Sea may have been the easy bit.
###2857 I'm leaving Africa to travel deep into Arabia.
###2865 And here I'm confronted by another great mystery.
###2876 How could those pioneers have survived here?
###2885 Back then, most of Arabia was brutal desert,
###2889 pretty much as it is today.
###2896 Is it really possible that a handful of Stone Age people
###2900 could have trekked through hundreds of miles of this
###2903 and gone on to populate the whole world?
###2913 Well, here's one man who looks like he knows
###2916 how to get around in the desert.
###2922 Archaeologist Jeff Rose has spent years scouring Arabia for evidence
###2928 of our earliest ancestors.
###2939 And he's come to meet me in Oman.
###2945 -Jeff. -Hello.
###2947 Hello, hoW are you?
###2949 So, Jeff, Why are We in this desolate place?
###2951 It's actually quite a special location.
###2953 If you look round, you see all these black rocks
###2955 that are lying across the surface.
###2957 Yeah, there's a particular concentration of them just round here.
###2960 Well, they're not really rocks.
###2962 They're all ancient stone tools made by early humans.
###2965 So, for instance, We just pick this piece up here,
###2968 it's got this flat surface
###2969 and this surface With flake scars, they're called, on it.
###2972 And then they've done some retouch on it.
###2974 They've hit it here, and they've hit it here,
###2976 to create this chisel-like edge.
###2978 So that can't have occurred naturally?
###2980 No. This couldn't have occurred naturally
###2981 because of the pattern of scars that We see on here.
###2983 It's called a burin.
###2985 And it Would have been used for Working soft materials,
###2988 hides, leather, bone, Wood, anything like that,
###2991 for carving tools out of that.
###2993 -So it's a little bit like a chisel. -Yeah.
###2995 That's just amazing, to pick up a stone tool like that
###2998 just lying on the surface.
###2999 You get used to it Working in Arabia, 'cause they're everyWhere.
###3001 Really?
###3002 It's just covering the surface everyWhere you look.
###3004 So you reckon most of these,
###3006 if they've got sort of flat surfaces on...
###3007 Yeah, just about anything you see that's flat lying...
###3010 Even things like that?
###3011 That's a blade. And that's from the edge of the blade,
###3013 -so that's called a cortex. -Yeah.
###3016 And a lot of times, they leave that cortex on
###3019 because if you're using it, you're not going to cut yourself.
###3021 So you can even see almost hoW they Would've held it, something like that.
###3024 -That makes a neat little knife. -Exactly.
###3026 Okay, so What is the date of this site? Putting you on the spot here, I knoW.
###3030 Well, it's hard to say. It's a surface site,
###3033 so it's impossible to date anything specifically,
###3035 but from that technology, from that core I shoWed you,
###3038 We can say it's anyWhere betWeen 70,000 and 12,000 years ago,
###3042 -and maybe even earlier. -As long ago as 70,000 years?
###3045 There Was a site that Was recently found on the Red Sea coast in Yemen
###3048 that Was dated to about 70,000 years ago,
###3050 and it's the same technology.
###3060 So there Were people here 70,000 years ago.
###3065 And I find that really difficult to believe,
###3068 because at that time the landscape Would have been
###3071 just as dry and harsh as it is today.
###3075 I mean, okay, there's stone to make tools out of.
###3080 But Where Were they living?
###3097 The biggest problem for those pioneering families
###3100 would have been the lack of water.
###3105 But a few short miles from these arid mountains
###3109 I'm in for a surprise.
###3133 Well, just look at this.
###3134 I'm only tWo miles aWay from the desert here,
###3137 but I could be in rural Somerset -
###3140 if it Weren't for the camels.
###3144 Definitely in Arabia.
###3157 This place near the coast of Oman
###3160 sits right on the edge of the monsoon region of the Indian Ocean.
###3169 Every year, the monsoons turn this valley into a green oasis,
###3177 somewhere you can imagine our ancestors flourishing.
###3185 But this is a green island in the middle of the desert.
###3190 The desert stretches on for hundreds of miles around here.
###3195 So hoW did our ancestors move through Arabia
###3201 to reach the World beyond?
###3210 There's no way they could have done it
###3212 without more widespread sources of fresh water.
###3220 But where are they?
###3245 I'm at sea, just off the coast of Oman,
###3248 a coastline that our ancestors may have passed along -
###3251 except that 70,000 years ago the coast Wouldn't have been there
###3255 because the sea level Was much loWer.
###3258 It Was up to 50 kilometres in that direction.
###3268 And Jeff Rose thinks that the key to our ancestors'journey
###3272 along this coast lies at the bottom of the sea.
###3278 One of the strangest things about Arabia is We have this dry surface,
###3281 this completely arid landscape, and yet beneath the surface
###3284 there are heaps of fresh Water that's bubbling toWard the coast,
###3287 running toWard the coast, and coming up directly beneath us.
###3290 So right doWn beloW, if you Were to dive doWn With a canteen,
###3293 you could fill it up With fresh Water and have a drink.
###3295 So the springs doWn there are still Working today?
###3297 Still Working today. There are heaps of fresh Water coming toWard the coast.
###3300 Only When the sea level Was loWer Would it have been available,
###3303 so it really shoWs Why that coastline Was so important
###3306 for the early humans moving out of Africa.
###3315 ROBERTS: So, around 70,000 years ago,
###3318 the Arabian coastline was very different to today.
###3327 Freshwater springs bubbled up all the way along it.
###3332 If our ancestors attempted this route, they would have found a lifeline
###3339 stretching all the way from the Red Sea to the Persian gulf...
###3346 a place which back then was a great fertile plain.
###3357 So the Gulf as We knoW it today didn't exist.
###3359 It Was a vast, green, lush plain.
###3362 Green and lush, you had estuaries and rivers and lakes.
###3366 It Was probably the most important place
###3368 in southWest Asia for all of early humans
###3371 because of so much fresh Water that Was available at that time.
###3374 So they had everything they needed for survival.
###3376 -Well, it sounds idyllic. -It Was.
###3383 ROBERTS: Finding the route that our ancestors took out of Africa
###3386 has been challenging.
###3389 But I really think that this could have been it.
###3396 And it's perhaps no wonder, with the obstacles they faced,
###3400 that there seems to have been just one successful attempt,
###3406 a massive leap in our ancestors'journey.
###3415 Africa Was the original home of our species,
###3419 and it Was our only home for tens of thousands of years
###3424 until a small handful of people made their Way out of Africa.
###3429 And it Was their descendants that Went on to colonise the rest of the World.
###3435 I'm going to try to trace their footsteps
###3438 as We continue on the great human journey.
###3448 Come with me as I travel right across the world...
###3451 This is looking like a pretty big footprint.
###3454 ...in search of the traces left by our ancestors.
###3459 -That's the original? -Yeah, original.
###3461 I didn't knoW any of it had survived.
###3465 I want to know how so few people could have populated the rest of the planet...
###3471 That makes us rethink all of our theories about early Americans.
###3478 ...facing the unimaginable,
###3483 rival species and even near extinction...
###3488 I don't knoW I've ever been so cold in my entire life.
###3493 ...to reach the most distant corners of the world.
###3497 I'm really Worried We're going to get sWept in by these breakers.
###3500 (WHOOPING)
###3504 And how did those journeys change us into who we are today?
