###0 EDDIE HUANG: Yo, I'm Eddie Huang, and
###1 I got high on munchies.
###2 
###9 I got to make fun of my boy eating a pear in a men's
###11 locker room.
###12 I got to tell plan B jokes.
###14 I told jokes about panda shit.
###17 You can't really do that anywhere else.
###18 It's fun.
###19 And we're not knuckleheads.
###20 We're not idiots.
###22 We are telling stories that mean something, but in our own
###25 vernacular.
###26 And that's what I really love.
###27 So there it is, the whole shebang.
###29 Vice presents Munchies with Eddie Huang.
###31 
###35 FEMALE SPEAKER 1: This famous cook?
###38 EDDIE HUANG: What is this?
###39 I don't know this.
###39 Oh, I would definitely chef here.
###42 I'm going to create a special health menu.
###46 EDDIE HUANG: Chinese juices, dragon sweat,
###49 panda shit, the best.
###52 
###58 Mmm.
###60 
###63 My name is Eddie Huang.
###64 The name of my restaurant is Baohaus, and we serve
###67 Taiwanese-style street food.
###69 
###74 Bao just means bun or bread in Chinese.
###79 Everybody has variations on pork bun.
###80 But I was like, yo, let's take a step back and do the OG
###83 shit, the real, authentic, Taiwanese way they've been
###86 doing since the '50s.
###87 So I wanted to red cook the pork and topping with peanuts
###90 and sugar and cilantro, like how we do in Taiwan, and it
###92 just really took off.
###94 It's not like my mission in life was to open a bao
###98 restaurant.
###98 This was the item that made the most sense.
###101 It's portable.
###103 It's the Asian answer to a taco.
###105 The names for the baos are cool.
###107 The original's named after Chairman Mao, because Mao's
###110 from Hunan.
###110 And my technique for the red-cooked pork belly is from
###114 Hunan the province.
###116 That's where my family's from.
###118 And then we got the bird house bao.
###120 It's chicken.
###121 The inspiration for that was Robin Givens because she's the
###123 biggest bird in the world.
###125 I hate that bitch.
###126 Ruined Mike Tyson.
###129 So yeah, we're going to go hang out with detective Max
###132 Koshkerman.
###132 He always sounds like he's interrogating people.
###134 MAX KOSHKERMAN: What do you got for breakfast, a salad?
###136 EDDIE HUANG: The other dude is Simonez Wolf, Chef Sez.
###140 I know Sez from the door at Le Band.
###143 He's always clowning motherfuckers outside, not
###145 letting anybody in.
###147 He's a funny cat.
###148 EMILE HAYNIE: How's it going?
###149 EDDIE HUANG: This motherfucker is the latest one man.
###151 What's wrong with you?
###152 You all know Emile.
###153 He produced "Runaway".
###154 He produced Lana Del Rey's new album.
###156 Honestly, we should just eat the fucking, that new pot pie.
###160 That new KFC pot pie is the moves.
###162 Really we all just hang out.
###164 And we like to eat.
###166 So we're going to go eat at Nan Xiang
###167 Shanghai-style breakfast.
###170 After you Mr. Jimenez.
###172 
###178 So Flushing's an interesting neighborhood because a lot of
###182 people feel like the best Chinese
###183 food comes from Taiwan.
###185 After the revolution, most Chinese master
###188 chefs fled to Taiwan.
###189 They came to New York, set up shop in Flushing.
###192 SIMONEZ WOLF: Which way?
###193 You know the way.
###194 EDDIE HUANG: First restaurant we went to was Nan
###196 Xiang Xiao Long Bao.
###197 They do the best Shanghainese breakfast I've had in New York
###200 hands down.
###202 Deep bow.
###203 Deep bow.
###204 Deep bow.
###205 That's a dismissive one.
###206 
###212 [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###217 EDDIE HUANG: You think Chinese breakfast, and everybody just
###219 assumes dim sum.
###220 But dim sum is a Cantonese thing, southern
###223 China on the coast.
###225 A lot of the rest of the eastern coast of China, people
###228 like to eat soup dumplings, hot soy milk, cruellers.
###232 These are dishes that you don't usually see in the
###235 American canon of Chinese food.
###236 So I like people to see it because that's
###239 what I grew up with.
###240 MAX KOSHKERMAN: I'll tell you what man.
###241 Only eat fresh soy milk.
###243 People don't even understand--
###244 EDDIE HUANG: Game over, dude.
###245 Game over.
###245 MAX KOSHKERMAN: --how incredible it is.
###247 EDDIE HUANG: This is a beef scallion pancake, one of my
###249 favorite dishes.
###250 
###255 This dish, it's beef and tripe together, spicy oil.
###258 But the folk name for it is [CHINESE],
###262 husband and wife platter.
###264 
###267 Now soup dumpling 101.
###270 I'm going to show this.
###271 You see a lot of goons poking holes right in the top.
###274 Hooligans.
###275 This is what you do.
###276 Soup dumpling gets a sauna.
###278 You put it in the vinegar.
###280 Let it chill out, maybe 30 seconds to a minute.
###283 It'll cool.
###283 Then you eat it.
###284 This is the only way to do it.
###285 You do it any other way--
###286 MAX KOSHKERMAN: Don't be a hooligan--
###288 EDDIE HUANG: Don't be a fucking hooligan.
###289 MAX KOSHKERMAN: --while eating a soup dumpling.
###290 EDDIE HUANG: Yeah.
###290 And you see all these motherfuckers on Facebook, oh
###293 my favorite food is soup dumplings.
###294 They're like poking them like this.
###297 MAX KOSHKERMAN: Respect the dumpling.
###299 Don't be a hooligan.
###299 SIMONEZ WOLF: Can I do this?
###300 This is good?
###301 MAX KOSHKERMAN: I don't know.
###302 EDDIE HUANG: That looks like some crazy French shit.
###307 See, I should host a show teaching people how to do this
###309 called, "So You Think You Want to be a Chinaman." "So You
###313 Think You Can Chinaman." Oh thank you.
###317 Thank you grasshopper.
###318 
###322 [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###324 EDDIE HUANG: Oh and then after that, we went to probably the
###327 best Cantonese restaurant in any of the five boroughs,
###329 Imperial Palace.
###331 
###338 MAX KOSHKERMAN: Respect for that.
###340 I can't reach that.
###341 Oh now hold on.
###343 SIMONEZ WOLF: Oh ninja.
###344 Oh, can't reach you.
###347 EDDIE HUANG: [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###354 EDDIE HUANG: I got the crab on rice, seafood
###356 on pan-fried noodles.
###358 I got a little fried grouper.
###359 I think we're good.
###360 MAX KOSHKERMAN: Is that lobster in that?
###362 EDDIE HUANG: [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###362 MAX KOSHKERMAN: What are you saying?
###363 EDDIE HUANG: [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###365 EDDIE HUANG: So Max was being extra difficult.
###367 I usually don't go to restaurant and order all
###370 fucking shellfish dishes.
###371 I asked Max what he wants.
###373 He goes, oh, lobster.
###374 Son, we're getting dungeness crab.
###376 You still want to get lobster?
###377 He's like, I only want to eat lobster.
###379 He wants lobster.
###380 He's going to be difficult until he
###382 gets his fucking lobster.
###383 MAX KOSHKERMAN: I just want to try that Cantonese style.
###385 EDDIE HUANG: How difficult.
###386 I thought you were difficult.
###387 This guy's fucking difficult.
###388 SIMONEZ WOLF: I'm difficult?
###389 EDDIE HUANG: No he's difficult.
###390 MAX KOSHKERMAN: I'm just high maintenance.
###390 SIMONEZ WOLF: I'm not difficult.
###391 I'm just proper.
###393 EDDIE HUANG: We got only shellfish.
###394 That's some bowl of shit.
###396 We only ordered shellfish.
###398 Cheers.
###399 
###402 And we got dungeness crab over sticky rice there.
###405 They take a live dungeness crab, butcher it live, take
###408 the top off.
###410 They'll take sticky rice.
###411 Then they'll throw it in the wok a little.
###413 Then it goes on top of lotus leaves into a bamboo steamer.
###416 Game over.
###417 It's probably the illest dish out there in any restaurant in
###420 the north right now.
###421 Go ahead.
###422 Go ahead Emile.
###422 You go in.
###423 Go dig in Emile.
###426 This is the best part, see inside the brain?
###429 That yellow shit.
###431 Get up in the brains.
###432 
###439 This shit is the best.
###441 So this is steamed oyster with XO sauce, chili oil, dried
###445 scallop, all kinds of good stuff.
###449 And then the fried rice dish that we had was a salt fish
###452 fried rice.
###453 The protein that you see in there is diced chicken bits.
###456 But the flavor for that fried rice is coming from salt fish.
###460 And I think I just said fried rice.
###461 [LAUGHS]
###463 EDDIE HUANG: That Chinglish just
###464 pops its head up sometimes.
###466 So ugly.
###467 SIMONEZ WOLF: Oh look, look, look.
###469 EDDIE HUANG: Oh here we go.
###471 I want you to take a photo with your lobster.
###474 
###477 Yo, if people knew Sim was geeking out, taking food
###481 photos like that, I don't think he could control any
###483 door in the city because he stunts on everyone.
###486 He the coolest guy you know.
###488 But now he's got his Yelp on, fucking taking photos of food
###491 for his blog.
###492 So it's a funny dynamic, all of us.
###495 But we don't give a fuck.
###496 We'll geek out over shit.
###498 We act a fool.
###499 Anywhere we go, you see we act a fool.
###503 After Imperial Palace, Emile pussied out.
###505 He didn't want to go to the Baths.
###506 SIMONEZ WOLF: You coming?
###510 EMILE HAYNIE: No, definitely not.
###512 No.
###513 EDDIE HUANG: So then we went to the Russian Baths.
###515 Just sweat it out, because we felt gross from all that food.
###517 
###520 How are you Simonez?
###521 We are here at the Russian Baths right now.
###524 SIMONEZ WOLF: Whoa whoa, gangsta.
###525 
###533 EDDIE HUANG: Max was in there with a bunch of dudes with no
###536 drawers on eating a pear.
###537 Definitely let the streets know, that's Max's shit.
###540 See, he was eating the fucking pear.
###542 You see him eating the fucking pear.
###544 No better place to eat a pear than in a locker room full of
###546 naked dudes.
###548 
###552 Yo, I like to just get blazed and sweat.
###554 It's kind of cool.
###555 It's the perfect thing to do high because you don't have to
###557 think about anything.
###559 Your mind is just consumed with sweating.
###561 And you feel like you worked out.
###563 You feel like you burnt some calories,
###564 even though you didn't.
###565 So we just fucking go to the baths.
###567 
###571 Look at this shit.
###573 Some intense negotiations going on here at the baths.
###578 Max, the price is listed man.
###581 The prices are listed.
###584 Max is always fucking negotiating with people.
###587 He don't ever want to pay full price for anything.
###589 He'd go to Chipotle and fucking negotiate if he could.
###592 MAX KOSHKERMAN: This plug, I want one more round on the
###594 house next time I come here.
###595 EDDIE HUANG: These Persian people are the cheapest.
###596 FEMALE SPEAKER 1: Yeah, but he know how to deal.
###600 EDDIE HUANG: You should take another photo here of him.
###602 Put it up.
###603 This man steals.
###604 
###607 Stealing memberships.
###608 MAX KOSHKERMAN: I'll see you later.
###609 EDDIE HUANG: Take care.
###610 FEMALE SPEAKER 1: Good luck.
###612 EDDIE HUANG: After we went to the baths, we
###615 just had the munchies.
###616 And we were like, what could we make?
###617 We're going to go to Baohaus and make fried bao ice cream
###621 sandwiches.
###622 It's going to be good.
###624 It's this way.
###626 MALE SPEAKER: We're happy, no.
###628 SIMONEZ WOLF: Neighborhood watch.
###629 EDDIE HUANG: Damn, you just stunted on him in front
###631 of his girl, yo.
###633 You stealing shorties tonight?
###635 You stealing shorties?
###636 
###638 All right, we're going to make this.
###643 Drop eight baos in the fryer.
###648 EDDIE HUANG: No, just for fun.
###649 You want one?
###650 We'll make one for you.
###651 FEMALE SPEAKER 2: Can I have one?
###652 EDDIE HUANG: Yeah, we'll make you one.
###653 No problem.
###654 MALE SPEAKER 2: Can I have one too?
###656 EDDIE HUANG: Had them fried baos with the red bean paste,
###658 the little shiso leaf, all the finest greenery.
###662 And then vanilla ice cream or green tea ice cream, depending
###665 on what your flavor is.
###667 Oh delicious.
###668 Here you go Sim.
###672 You want ice cream sandwiches?
###674 All right, come get it.
###677 Don't be shy.
###679 Y'all scared of ice cream sandwiches?
###681 MALE SPEAKER 3: I'm a little confused about this.
###683 EDDIE HUANG: Yeah, what are you confused about?
###684 It's fucking ice cream and fried baos.
###687 What's there to be confused about?
###689 We're going to feed the streets right now, everybody.
###694 SIMONEZ WOLF: It's like a soup kitchen for ice cream.
###695 EDDIE HUANG: Yeah, it's a soup kitchen.
###696 This is a ice cream soup kitchen.
###698 Here you go.
###699 Enjoy man.
###701 Yeah man, motherfuckers love free shit.
###703 They like anything free.
###704 I could've taken a shit in a bao and they
###706 would've loved it.
###708 See this high munchie shit, it doesn't need to be pretty.
###711 It just needs to be delicious.
###712 
###715 It's a fucking recession.
###716 I'm going to feed people.
###718 I'm going to run on this platform, ice cream.
###720 If your platform can be like, no, you cannot use Plan B.
###724 I'll be like, I'm a nice guy.
###725 I want you to eat ice cream and use Plan B.
###729
