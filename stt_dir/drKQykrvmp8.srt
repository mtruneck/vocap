1
0:0:52,1 --> 0:0:55,1
March 13th, 1962.


2
0:0:55,1 --> 0:0:58,2
Lyman Lemnitzer,
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff


3
0:0:58,2 --> 0:1:3,801
presents a proposal to Secretary of Defense
Robert McNamara, named Operation Northwoods.


4
0:1:3,801 --> 0:1:8,101
The document proposed staging terrorist
attacks in and around Guantanamo Bay,


5
0:1:8,101 --> 0:1:12,401
to provide a pretext for military
intervention in Cuba.


6
0:1:12,401 --> 0:1:14,1
The plans included:


7
0:1:14,1 --> 0:1:16,802
Starting rumors about Cuba using
clandestine radio.


8
0:1:16,802 --> 0:1:19,402
Landing friendly Cubans inside the base
to stage attacks.

And finally, destroying a drone aircraft,
over Cuban waters.


16
0:1:44,903 --> 0:1:50,4
The passengers, federal agents in reality,
would allegedly be college students on vacation.


17
0:1:50,4 --> 0:1:54,904
A plane at Eglin Air Force Base would be painted
and numbered as a duplicate of a registered civil aircraft


18
0:1:54,904 --> 0:1:57,804
belonging to a CIA front in Miami.


19
0:1:57,804 --> 0:2:1,204
The duplicate would be substituted for the real
plane and loaded with the passengers.


20
0:2:1,204 --> 0:2:4,305
The real plane would be converted into a drone.


21
0:2:4,305 --> 0:2:6,405
The two planes would randezvous south of Florida.


22
0:2:6,405 --> 0:2:12,305
The passenger laden plane would land at Eglin Air Force Base
to evacuate its passengers and return to its original status.


23
0:2:12,305 --> 0:2:19,906
The drone would pick up the scheduled flight plan and over
Cuban waters transmit a "mayday signal" before being blown up by remote control.


24
0:2:19,906 --> 0:2:27,506
The plan was rejected by McNamara, and President John F. Kennedy
personally removes Lemnitzer as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.


25
0:2:27,506 --> 0:2:30,306

A remote-controlled Boeing 720 takes off from Edwards
Air Force Base, and is crash-landed by NASA for fuel research.


27
0:2:38,307 --> 0:2:42,807
Before its destruction, the plane flew a total of
16 hours and 22 minutes,


28
0:2:42,807 --> 0:2:49,807

releases their report entitled
"Rebuilding America's Defences."


43
0:3:42,811 --> 0:3:47,911
In it, they declare that " the process of transformation,
even if it brings revolutionary change, "


44
0:3:47,911 --> 0:3:52,211
" is likely to be a long one, absent some
catastrophic and catalyzing event - "


45
0:3:52,211 --> 0:3:54,812
" like a new Pearl Harbor. "


46
0:3:54,812 --> 0:3:56,912
October 24th, 2000.


47
0:3:56,912 --> 0:4:0,812
The Pentagon conducts the first of two training exercises
called MASCAL,


48
0:4:0,812 --> 0:4:5,712
which simulate a Boeing 757 crashing into the building.

Charles Burlingame, an ex-Navy F4 pilot
who worked in the Pentagon,


50

51
0:4:14,13 --> 0:4:19,813

but is rejected as "too unrealistic".


55
0:4:28,314 --> 0:4:30,414
June, 2001.


56
0:4:30,414 --> 0:4:35,414

3,150 put options are placed on United Airlines' stock.


68
0:5:31,418 --> 0:5:34,418

were more than 4 times its daily average.


70
0:5:40,118 --> 0:5:48,319

NORAD is in the middle of a number of military exercises.


84
0:7:1,423 --> 0:7:4,924
The first, "Vigilant Guardian", is described as


85
0:7:4,924 --> 0:7:10,524
"an exercise that would pose an imaginary crisis to North
American Air Defense outposts nationwide".


86
0:7:10,524 --> 0:7:18,825
The second, "Northern Vigilance", moved fighter jets to Canada
and Alaska to fight off an imaginary Russian fleet.


87
0:7:18,825 --> 0:7:23,825
Three F-16s from Washington DC's National Guard at
Andrews Air Force Base,


88
0:7:23,825 --> 0:7:31,525
15 miles from the Pentagon, are flown 180 nautical miles
away for a training mission in North Carolina.


89
0:7:31,525 --> 0:7:35,926
This left 14 fighter jets to protect the entire
United States.


90
0:7:35,926 --> 0:7:38,726
" Hi, Boston Center TMU, we have a  problem here "


91
0:7:38,726 --> 0:7:41,826
" we have a hijacked aircraft headed towards New York "


92
0:7:41,826 --> 0:7:47,626
" and we need you guys to, we need someone to scramble
some F-16s or something up there, help us out. "


93
0:7:47,626 --> 0:7:54,527
" Is this real or exercise? "
" No, this is not exercise, not a test. "


94
0:7:54,527 --> 0:8:0,327
" Do we wanna think about scrambling an aircraft? "


95
0:8:0,327 --> 0:8:3,327
" Oooh, God I don't know. "


96
0:8:3,327 --> 0:8:9,528
" That's a decision somebody's gonna
have to make probably in the next 10 minutes. "


97
0:8:9,528 --> 0:8:13,228
" Uh, yeah, you know, everybody just
left the room. "


98
0:8:13,228 --> 0:8:16,928
" The first question I have is basically to
get from you a sense of "


99
0:8:16,928 --> 0:8:21,929
" how you would rate the american media
in their coverage of the events of the attack last September? "


100
0:8:21,929 --> 0:8:26,929
[Hunter S Thomson] " Well let's see eehmmm,
shamefully is a word that comes to mind "


101
0:8:26,929 --> 0:8:31,429
" This just in you are looking at obviously
very disturbing liveshot there "


102
0:8:31,429 --> 0:8:35,29
" that is the World Trade Center and we have
unconfirmed reports this morning "


103
0:8:35,29 --> 0:8:39,83
" that a plane had crashed into
one of the towers of the World Trade Center. "


104
0:8:39,83 --> 0:8:42,93
"But overall, the American journalism
was cowed, "


105
0:8:42,93 --> 0:8:48,43
" and intimidated by the
this massive flag-sucking, this patriotic, orgy...  "


106
0:8:48,43 --> 0:8:53,431
" you know if you're criticizing the president it's unpatriotic and
there's something wrong with you and you may be a terrorist..."


107
0:8:53,431 --> 0:8:58,31
" So, so in that sense,Hunter S Thomson, there's not enough
room for dissenting voices? "


108
0:8:58,31 --> 0:9:2,531
" Well, there's plenty of room,
just not enough people willing to take the risk. "


109
0:9:2,531 --> 0:9:7,431
" I don't know whether we've confirmed
that this was an aircraft or to be more specific "


110
0:9:7,431 --> 0:9:10,932
" some people said they thought they saw a missile. "


111
0:9:10,932 --> 0:9:14,632
" There was definitely a blue logo, [it was l-] circular logo
on the front of the plane "


112
0:9:14,632 --> 0:9:18,432
" it definitely did not look like a commercial
plane, I didn't see any windows on the sides. "


113
0:9:18,432 --> 0:9:21,432
" Mark, if that what you say is true
those could be cargo planes. "


114
0:9:21,432 --> 0:9:23,833
" You said, you didn't see any windows in the sides? "


115
0:9:23,833 --> 0:9:28,533
" I didn't see any windows on sides. It was not a normal
flight that I had ever seen, "


116
0:9:28,533 --> 0:9:32,633
" at an airport, it was a plane that had a blue logo on the front "


117
0:9:32,633 --> 0:9:35,933
" and, and it just ... it did not look like it belonged in this area. "


118
0:9:35,933 --> 0:9:40,834
" It's sort of a herd mentality
a lemming-like mentality. "


119
0:9:40,834 --> 0:9:46,334
" if you don't go with the flow you're anti-american
and therefore a suspect. "


120
0:9:46,334 --> 0:9:49,34
" This is as close as we can get to the base of the
World Trade Center "


121
0:9:49,34 --> 0:9:52,934
" you can see the firemen assembled here,
the police officers, FBI agents "


122
0:9:52,934 --> 0:10:42,838
" and you can see the Two Towers, a huge explosion,
raining debris on all of us. We better get out of the way! "


123
0:10:42,838 --> 0:10:44,738
" You sort of wonder,
when something like that happens, "


124
0:10:44,738 --> 0:10:49,438
" who stands to benefit? Who had the opportunity and motive? "


125
0:10:49,438 --> 0:10:51,538
" You just gotta look at this basic things. "


126
0:10:51,538 --> 0:10:55,838
" I don't assume that I know the truth about
what went on that day. "


127
0:10:55,838 --> 0:10:58,239
" And yeah, I just look around looking for "


128
0:10:58,239 --> 0:11:2,439
" who had the motive, who had the opportunity,
who had the equipment, "


129
0:11:2,439 --> 0:11:27,54
" who had the will... "


130
0:11:27,54 --> 0:11:31,841
" I've spent enough time on the inside, well the White House,
and, you know campaigns, "


131
0:11:31,841 --> 0:11:34,241
" and I've known enough of the people who do these things, "


132
0:11:34,241 --> 0:11:39,441
" to know that, the public version of the news, of an event,
is never really what happened. "


133
0:11:39,441 --> 0:11:51,42
" And these people I think are willing to take that
even further. "


134
0:11:51,42 --> 0:11:57,142
" It seems a very long bow to me, but are you sort of
suggesting that this worked in a favor of the Bush administration? "


135
0:11:57,142 --> 0:12:47,345
" Oh absolutely, ... absolutely. "


136
0:12:47,345 --> 0:12:54,346
9:38. Arlington, Virginia.


137
0:12:54,346 --> 0:13:2,346
Hani Hanjour allegedly executes a
330 degree turn at 530 MPH


138
0:13:2,346 --> 0:13:25,748
descending 7,000 feet in two and a half minutes to crash
American Airlines Flight 77 into the ground floor of the Pentagon.


139
0:13:25,748 --> 0:13:34,348
Its final approach took it directly across Interstate-395,


140
0:13:34,348 --> 0:13:42,349
knocking light poles out of the ground and
bouncing off of the lawn before impact.


141
0:13:42,349 --> 0:13:46,449
First, let's meet Hani Hanjour.


142
0:13:46,449 --> 0:13:52,35
Hanjour came to Freeway Airport in Bowie, Maryland,
one month earlier seeking to rent a small plane.


143
0:13:52,35 --> 0:13:56,5
However, when Hanjour went on three test runs
in the second week of August


144
0:13:56,5 --> 0:14:2,55
he had trouble controlling
and landing a single engine Cessna 172.


145
0:14:2,55 --> 0:14:7,651
" Hello, my name is Marcel Bernard
and I'm the chief flight instructor here at Freeway. "


146
0:14:7,651 --> 0:14:11,51
" Hani Hanjour,
well basically what happened with him "


147
0:14:11,51 --> 0:14:15,651
" is... he showed at the airport and wanted to get "


148
0:14:15,651 --> 0:14:18,651
" checked out in the aircraft
you see, he was already certified "


149
0:14:18,651 --> 0:14:20,551
" he didn't come to us for flight training. "


150
0:14:20,551 --> 0:14:21,651
" Yeah, he already had a pilot's license. "


151
0:14:21,651 --> 0:14:22,752
" He already earned a "


152
0:14:22,752 --> 0:14:28,552
" it was private,instrument,commercial at a school in Arizona
I don't remember the name of the school. "


153
0:14:28,552 --> 0:14:30,852
" He already had certificates in hand and "


154
0:14:30,852 --> 0:14:36,152
" we sometimes occasionally have pilots who come to us
that don't want flight training, but just want to "


155
0:14:36,152 --> 0:14:37,752
" rent our aircraft. "


156
0:14:37,752 --> 0:14:39,653
" Which is the case of Hani Hanjour? "


157
0:14:39,653 --> 0:14:43,453
" This was the case of Hani, he wanted to get
"checked-out" as we call it to rent our aircraft. "


158
0:14:43,453 --> 0:14:46,653
" And our insurance requires that he
flies with one of our instructors "


159
0:14:46,653 --> 0:14:48,653
" to be found competent to rent. "


160
0:14:48,653 --> 0:14:51,554
" And that was the process that he was going through. "


161
0:14:51,554 --> 0:14:55,154
" And consensus was , he was very quiet, "


162
0:14:55,154 --> 0:14:59,654
" average, or below average piloting skills, "


163
0:14:59,654 --> 0:15:2,654
" English was very poor "


164
0:15:2,654 --> 0:15:7,754
" so, that's about the best description i can get, give you "


165
0:15:7,754 --> 0:15:10,755
" for his demeanor. "


166
0:15:10,755 --> 0:15:16,655
" At that time very uneventful from my perspective. "


167
0:15:16,655 --> 0:15:21,455
Regardless, air traffic controllers at Dulles International Airport
that were tracking Flight 77


168
0:15:21,455 --> 0:15:25,355
all thought that it was a military plane.


169
0:15:25,355 --> 0:15:29,456
Second. The light poles.


170
0:15:29,456 --> 0:15:34,856
On November 22nd, 2004, a private jet en route to
Houston to pick up George Bush Senior


171
0:15:34,856 --> 0:15:40,356
clipped a single light pole and crashed a minute away
from landing at Houston's Hobby Airport.


172
0:15:40,356 --> 0:15:46,457
The wing ripped off upon impact,
scattering debris over 100 yards.


173
0:15:46,457 --> 0:15:50,857
And yet, Flight 77 managed to tear 5
light poles completely out of the ground,


174
0:15:50,857 --> 0:15:53,857
without damaging either the wings
or the light poles themselves.


175
0:15:53,857 --> 0:15:59,658
Instead, they seem to have just popped
out of the ground.


176
0:15:59,658 --> 0:16:6,558
Third. You only have to look at the photos from that day to realize
that whatever hit the Pentagon did not bounce off the lawn.


177
0:16:6,558 --> 0:16:16,559
If Flight 77 had crash landed and skidded into the Pentagon,
it would have looked like this.


178
0:16:16,559 --> 0:16:23,359
Instead, it looked like this,
without a single scratch on the lawn.


179
0:16:23,359 --> 0:16:28,46
Fourth. Why is there absolutely no trace of Flight 77?


180
0:16:28,46 --> 0:16:30,86
" You know, it, it might've appeared that way "


181
0:16:30,86 --> 0:16:34,46
" but from my closeup inspection there's no evidence "


182
0:16:34,46 --> 0:16:37,46
" of a plane having crashed anywhere near the Pentagon. "


183
0:16:37,46 --> 0:16:41,56
" The only sight is the actual side of the building
that's crashed in, "


184
0:16:41,56 --> 0:16:44,661
" and as I said the only pieces left that you can see "


185
0:16:44,661 --> 0:16:47,461
" are small enough that you can pick up in your hand. "


186
0:16:47,461 --> 0:16:50,861
" There are no large tail sections, wing sections, "


187
0:16:50,861 --> 0:16:54,961
" a fuselage, nothing like that anywhere around,
which would indicate, "


188
0:16:54,961 --> 0:16:59,561
" that the entire plane crashed into the side
of the Pentagon  ... "


189
0:16:59,561 --> 0:17:6,362
The official explanation is that the intense heat from the
jet fuel vaporized the entire plane.


190
0:17:6,362 --> 0:17:14,462
Indeed. From these pictures, it seems that there is
absolutely no trace of a Boeing 757.


191
0:17:14,462 --> 0:17:17,963
But if the fire was hot enough to incinerate a jumbo jet,


192
0:17:17,963 --> 0:17:23,363
then how could investigators identify 184 out of 189
people found at the Pentagon?


193
0:17:23,363 --> 0:17:27,963
The Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory,
which was responsible for the task,


194
0:17:27,963 --> 0:17:32,364
was also responsible for identifying the dead in Shanksville.


195
0:17:32,364 --> 0:17:34,664
Keep that in mind for later.


196
0:17:34,664 --> 0:17:40,464
So what is a Boeing 757 made of?
I called Boeing to ask, but ...


197
0:17:40,464 --> 0:17:46,64
The operator informed me that Boeing refuses to give out any
information regarding the construction of their aircraft.


198
0:17:46,64 --> 0:17:50,365
Due to the attacks of September 11th.


199
0:17:50,365 --> 0:17:56,665
But what we do know, is that the 757 has two Pratt & Whitney
engines made of steel and titanium alloy


200
0:17:56,665 --> 0:18:3,466
which are 9 feet in diameter, 12 feet long
and weigh 6 tons each.


201
0:18:3,466 --> 0:18:8,466
Titanium, has a melting point of 1688 degrees Celsius.


202
0:18:8,466 --> 0:18:13,566
Jet fuel, also known as kerosene, is a hydrocarbon,
which can retain a constant temperature


203
0:18:13,566 --> 0:18:20,367
of 1120 degrees Celsius after 40 minutes ,
but only if the fuel is maintained.


204
0:18:20,367 --> 0:18:23,367
The fuel would have burned off immediately
upon impact.


205
0:18:23,367 --> 0:18:30,567
Therefore, it is scientifically impossible that 12 tons
of steel and titanium was vaporized by kerosene.


206
0:18:30,567 --> 0:18:35,168
Likewise, the two engines should have been found
relatively intact at the Pentagon.


207
0:18:35,168 --> 0:18:43,368
Instead, there was a single turbo-jet engine approximately
3 feet in diameter found inside the building.


208
0:18:43,368 --> 0:18:46,168
After this photo was published by
American Free Press,


209
0:18:46,168 --> 0:18:55,369
readers wrote in to suggest that the turbine was a piece from the
Auxilliary Power Unit - APU mounted in the tail section of the 757.


210
0:18:55,369 --> 0:19:1,269
Chris Bollyn contacted Honeywell in Phoenix, Arizona,
the manufacturer of a 757's APU.


211
0:19:1,269 --> 0:19:7,57
An expert, speaking on the condition of anonymity
told him that: " There's no way that's an APU wheel ".


212
0:19:7,57 --> 0:19:10,67
Bollyn then contacted Pratt & Whitney and Rolls-Royce,


213
0:19:10,67 --> 0:19:13,57
the two companies that manufacture 757 engines.


214
0:19:13,57 --> 0:19:20,67
Pratt & Whitney pointed Bollyn towards Rolls-Royce and
John W Brown a spokesman for Rolls-Royce told Bollyn that:


215
0:19:20,67 --> 0:19:25,571
" It is not a part from any Rolls-Royce engine that I'm
familiar with. "


216
0:19:25,571 --> 0:19:27,471
In an article written by Karl Schwartz


217
0:19:27,471 --> 0:19:33,571
President and Chief Executive Officer of
Patmos Nanotechnologies LLC and I-nets Security Systems


218
0:19:33,571 --> 0:19:40,672
he believes that the piece is a JT8D Turbojet Engine
from the US Air Force A3 ScottWarrior.


219
0:19:40,672 --> 0:19:43,572
The piece in the FEMA photo is
the front shaft bearing housing.


220
0:19:43,572 --> 0:19:50,572
Jet engines have a center shaft which must be balanced
as well as bare seals on the front and back.


221
0:19:50,572 --> 0:19:53,973
The photo shows the front seal and
a rotar hub missing its fan blades.


222
0:19:53,973 --> 0:19:59,473
These blades are easily removed in a
collision such as the one found at the Pentagon.


223
0:19:59,473 --> 0:20:3,473
The United States Air Force has only a few A3's left in operation,


224
0:20:3,473 --> 0:20:6,573
and they're stored in Van Nuys California at
Hughes Aircraft,


225
0:20:6,573 --> 0:20:10,574
which is now better known as Raytheon.


226
0:20:10,574 --> 0:20:18,574
So if this piece didn't come from a 757, then where?
And where are the engines from Flight 77?


227
0:20:18,574 --> 0:20:22,374
The second identifiable piece of debris was allegedly
a piece of the fuselage.


228
0:20:22,374 --> 0:20:26,775
Skeptics have claimed that this is proof that Flight 77
hit the Pentagon.


229
0:20:26,775 --> 0:20:30,475
But this piece could have come from any
American Airlines plane.


230
0:20:30,475 --> 0:20:38,475
And why is it not singed or scratched after a 530 MPH
impact and a subsequent fireball.


231
0:20:38,475 --> 0:20:40,776
The third piece of debris was a diffusor case.


232
0:20:40,776 --> 0:20:44,776
Let's look a little closer at the diffusor case of a 757.


233
0:20:44,776 --> 0:20:48,776
Do you see the triangular bezels around the openings?


234
0:20:48,776 --> 0:20:53,376
Those are nowhere to be found on the case
found at the Pentagon.


235
0:20:53,376 --> 0:20:56,877
The remainder of the debris was light enough
to have been carried by hand.


236
0:20:56,877 --> 0:21:1,577
And employees at the Pentagon were seen carrying away
a large box shrouded in a blue tarp.


237
0:21:1,577 --> 0:21:4,677
Why the mystery?


238
0:21:4,677 --> 0:21:11,77
If Flight 77 was vaporized on impact, it would be
the first time in aviation history.


239
0:21:11,77 --> 0:21:14,878
For example. August 15th, 2005.


240
0:21:14,878 --> 0:21:21,778
Helios Airways Flight 522, a Boeing 737, en route to
Athens, Greece crashed into a hillside at full speed.


241
0:21:21,778 --> 0:21:25,478
121 passengers, all dead.


242
0:21:25,478 --> 0:21:31,879
Fire. Tail sections. Wing sections.


243
0:21:31,879 --> 0:21:37,179
Engines. Cockpit. Bodies.


244
0:21:37,179 --> 0:21:38,679
Catch my drift?


245
0:21:38,679 --> 0:21:56,98
Fifth. Why is the damage to the Pentagon completely
inconsistent with a Boeing 757?


246
0:21:56,98 --> 0:22:0,781
These photos were taken before the roof
of the outer ring had collapsed.


247
0:22:0,781 --> 0:22:9,581
The only damage to the outer wall is a single hole,
no more than 16 feet in diameter.


248
0:22:9,581 --> 0:22:16,682
A Boeing 757 is 155 feet long, 44 feet high,


249
0:22:16,682 --> 0:22:21,582
has a 124 foot wingspan,
and weighs almost 100 tons.


250
0:22:21,582 --> 0:22:27,382
Are we supposed to believe that it disappeared into this hole,
without leaving any wreckage on the outside?


251
0:22:27,382 --> 0:22:30,783
Why is there no damage from where the wings,
or the vertical stabilizer,


252
0:22:30,783 --> 0:22:36,583
or the engines would have slammed
into the building?


253
0:22:36,583 --> 0:22:38,683
Remember how big the engines were?


254
0:22:38,683 --> 0:22:43,583
If 6 tons of steel and titanium slammed
into the Pentagon at 530 MPH,


255
0:22:43,583 --> 0:22:47,884
they would bury themselves inside the building,
leaving two very distinct imprints.


256
0:22:47,884 --> 0:22:51,684
And yet, the only damage on the outside of the Pentagon
is this single hole,


257
0:22:51,684 --> 0:22:55,984
with no damage from where the engines
would have hit.


258
0:22:55,984 --> 0:23:0,684
Why are the windows next to the hole
completely intact?


259
0:23:0,684 --> 0:23:6,585
Why are the cable spools directly in front
of the hole completely untouched?


260
0:23:6,585 --> 0:23:11,885
And as for the inside of the Pentagon, there's another
hole approximately 16 feet in diameter


261
0:23:11,885 --> 0:23:14,985
found on the other side of the C ring,
three rings from the impact.


262
0:23:14,985 --> 0:23:17,485
For that hole to have been caused by Flight 77,


263
0:23:17,485 --> 0:23:23,586
the Boeing would have had to smash through
9 feet of steel reinforced concrete.


264
0:23:23,586 --> 0:23:27,586
The nose of a commercial airliner is
composed of light-weight carbon.


265
0:23:27,586 --> 0:23:34,487
This is what usually happens to the nose of a
commercial airliner in a plane crash.


266
0:23:34,487 --> 0:23:40,887
If the nose caused this hole, where's the rest
of the debris from the plane?


267
0:23:40,887 --> 0:23:44,487
So what could blow a 16 foot hole in the outer
ring of the Pentagon,


268
0:23:44,487 --> 0:23:50,988
smash through 9 feet of steel reinforced concrete and
leave another 16 foot hole?


269
0:23:50,988 --> 0:23:54,588
A cruise missile.


270
0:23:54,588 --> 0:24:0,688
This is what Slobodan Milosevic's residence in Belgrade looked
like after a TomaHawk cruise missile had hit it.


271
0:24:0,688 --> 0:24:5,189
See any similarities?


272
0:24:5,189 --> 0:24:6,789
Sixth, the eyewitnesses.


273
0:24:6,789 --> 0:24:10,889
Some saw a huge 100 ton commercial airliner.


274
0:24:10,889 --> 0:24:18,989
" And I looked off, I was, you know looked out my window
I saw this plane, jet, American Airlines jet coming. "


275
0:24:18,989 --> 0:24:24,9
Some saw a small, 8 to 20 passenger commuter plane.


276
0:24:24,9 --> 0:24:29,99
" ...maybe a 20 passenger corporate jet, no
markings on the sides... "


277
0:24:29,99 --> 0:24:33,89
And some saw a United States Military helicopter.


278
0:24:33,89 --> 0:24:37,691
" ...when it occured, he said that he saw a helicopter
circle the building. "


279
0:24:37,691 --> 0:24:45,391
" He said that it appeared to be a US Military helicopter, and
that it disappeared behind the building where the helicopter landing zone is."


280
0:24:45,391 --> 0:24:49,591
" And that he then saw a fireball goin to the sky. "


281
0:24:49,591 --> 0:24:53,692
So who's telling the truth?
Take this into consideration.


282
0:24:53,692 --> 0:24:57,192
April Gallop was working in the Pentagon's
west side when it was hit.


283
0:24:57,192 --> 0:25:0,892
In Jim Marrs' book Inside Job, April claims...


284
0:25:0,892 --> 0:25:4,692
" While in the hospital, men in suits visited her more than once. "


285
0:25:4,692 --> 0:25:8,293
" They never identified themselves
or what agency they worked for. "


286
0:25:8,293 --> 0:25:10,593
" They didn't tell her what to say,
just made suggestions. "


287
0:25:10,593 --> 0:25:13,693
" For example, to take the compensation money and shut up. "


288
0:25:13,693 --> 0:25:18,393
" They also kept insisting that a plane hit the building.
They repeated this over and over. "


289
0:25:18,393 --> 0:25:21,893
" But I was there, and I never saw a plane,
or even debris from a plane. "


290
0:25:21,893 --> 0:25:25,794
" I figure this story is to brainwash people. "


291
0:25:25,794 --> 0:25:29,494
So if a Boeing 757 didn't hit the Pentagon,
then what did?


292
0:25:29,494 --> 0:25:59,196
Eyewitnesses inside and outside the building were thrown
to the ground by what they described as a shockwave.


293
0:25:59,196 --> 0:26:5,896
Even the Sheraton Hotel, 1.6 Miles away,
was rocked by the blast.


294
0:26:5,896 --> 0:26:18,997
A number of military personnel at the Pentagon
specifically mentioned smelling cordite.


295
0:26:18,997 --> 0:26:23,997
Cordite and jet fuel have two very distinct smells.


296
0:26:23,997 --> 0:26:30,498
Cordite is a compound used in ammunition, which is
comprised of nitroguanidine, nitrocellulose, and nitroglycerin.


297
0:26:30,498 --> 0:26:38,698
It is cool-burning, produces little smoke and no flash,
but produces a strong detonation wave.


298
0:26:38,698 --> 0:26:41,498
And, eyewitnesses described a bright, silvery flash.


299
0:26:41,498 --> 0:26:47,899
Jet fuel combustion, i.e. the planes that struck the Twin Towers,
is bright yellow at best.


300
0:26:47,899 --> 0:26:50,299
Watch this.


301
0:26:50,299 --> 0:26:55,499
A massive smouldering fireball,
no silvery flash, no shockwave.


302
0:26:55,499 --> 0:27:2,2
And at the Pentagon, a tiny bright silvery flash,
which shakes nearby buildings.


303
0:27:2,2 --> 0:27:8,8
Whatever it was, it might have been related to the
two planes that were in the air after the crash.


304
0:27:8,8 --> 0:27:28,201
The first one was uniformly identified as a C-130.


305
0:27:28,201 --> 0:27:36,402
The second plane was an unmarked white plane flying
over Washington DC.


306
0:27:36,402 --> 0:27:39,702
" Aaron, I'm standing in Lafayette Park
directly across from the White House "


307
0:27:39,702 --> 0:27:42,802
" perhaps about 200 yards from the White House
residence itself "


308
0:27:42,802 --> 0:27:46,803
" about 10 minutes ago there was a white jet circling overhead. "


309
0:27:46,803 --> 0:27:51,403
" Now you generally don't see planes in the area
over the White House, that is restricted airspace. "


310
0:27:51,403 --> 0:27:55,3
" No reason to believe that this jet was there
for any nefarious purposes, "


311
0:27:55,3 --> 0:27:58,603
" but the Secret Service was very concerned,
pointing up at the jet in the sky. "


312
0:27:58,603 --> 0:28:2,304
" It is out of sight now, best we can tell. "


313
0:28:2,304 --> 0:28:7,804
At 9:25, Jane Garvey, the head of the FAA,
initiated a national ground stop,


314
0:28:7,804 --> 0:28:11,504
which prevents further takeoffs and requires
all planes in the air to land.


315
0:28:11,504 --> 0:28:17,105
The order, which hasn't been implemented since 1903,
applied to almost every single kind of a plane:


316
0:28:17,105 --> 0:28:19,205
civilian, military, or law enforcement.


317
0:28:19,205 --> 0:28:24,705
Certain military flights were allowed to fly during this time,
but the FAA isn't talking.


318
0:28:24,705 --> 0:28:29,905
Why were these two planes allowed in the air
when everyone else had to land?


319
0:28:29,905 --> 0:28:34,406
And finally, why did people keep reporting
a second explosion at the Pentagon?


320
0:28:34,406 --> 0:28:40,6
" Well, I can't tell you about that, but I was just here in front
of the capital, which by the way has been evacuated, "


321
0:28:40,6 --> 0:28:44,906
" and back toward the Supreme Court area
we just heard a low muffled thud. "


322
0:28:44,906 --> 0:28:47,6
" It sounded like a small explosion. "


323
0:28:47,6 --> 0:28:55,7
" There have been unconfirmed reports of second explosions
here at the Pentagon, we have not confirmed that, but again ... "


324
0:28:55,7 --> 0:29:0,407
Where did this fireball come from?


325
0:29:0,407 --> 0:29:6,808
Seventh, surveillance cameras from a gas station,
Sheraton Hotel,


326
0:29:6,808 --> 0:29:12,8
and the Virginia Department of Transportation
captured the entire thing.


327
0:29:12,8 --> 0:29:15,508
However, the FBI was there within minutes
to confiscate the tapes,


328
0:29:15,508 --> 0:29:19,208
including a warning for the employees
not to discuss what they had seen.


329
0:29:19,208 --> 0:29:23,9
If the government wishes to prove once and for all
that Flight 77 hit the Pentagon,


330
0:29:23,9 --> 0:29:27,209
all they would have to do is release one of those tapes.


331
0:29:27,209 --> 0:29:44,31
Instead, they released 5 frames from a camera across
the heliport, even though none of them show a 757.


332
0:29:44,31 --> 0:29:49,91
And finally, why do satellite photos taken 4 days before 9/11
show a white marking on the front lawn,


333
0:29:49,91 --> 0:29:55,411
marking almost the exact trajectory of whatever
hit the Pentagon 4 days later?


334
0:29:55,411 --> 0:29:59,511
And is it merely a coincidence that the Pentagon was hit
in the only section


335
0:29:59,511 --> 0:30:4,211
that was renovated to withstand
that very same kind of attack,


336
0:30:4,211 --> 0:30:10,412
and that Donald Rumsfeld was safe in his office
on the opposite end of the building?


337
0:30:10,412 --> 0:30:42,414
If the government has nothing to hide, why are they so afraid
to answer a few questions, or release a few videos?


338
0:30:42,414 --> 0:30:47,414
9:59. New York City, New York.


339
0:30:47,414 --> 0:30:55,415
The South Tower of the World Trade Center collapses
to the ground in approximately 10 seconds.


340
0:30:55,415 --> 0:31:2,415
29 minutes later the North Tower follows suit,
collapsing in approximately 10 seconds.


341
0:31:2,415 --> 0:31:10,416
Later that evening at 5:20, WTC 7, a 47 storey office building
300 feet away from the North Tower, suddenly collapses.


342
0:31:10,416 --> 0:31:18,416
The building's tenants included the CIA, Department of Defense,
IRS, Secret Service and Rudy Giuliani's emergency bunker.


343
0:31:18,416 --> 0:31:26,417
And the SeC was using it to store 3 to 4 thousand files
related to numerous Wall Street investigations.


344
0:31:26,417 --> 0:31:31,717
Although every single building surrounding Building 7
stood intact, it fell straight down,


345
0:31:31,717 --> 0:31:37,417
into a convenient little pile, in 6 seconds.


346
0:31:37,417 --> 0:31:41,518
Official explanation? Falling debris from the Twin Towers
created an internal fire,


347
0:31:41,518 --> 0:31:46,518
which ignited several fuel tanks
inside the building.


348
0:31:46,518 --> 0:31:52,18
If this is true, then it would be the third building in history
to collapse because of a fire.


349
0:31:52,18 --> 0:31:56,418
The first two would be the Twin Towers.


350
0:31:56,418 --> 0:32:4,619
On July 28th, 1945, a B-25 bomber lost in the fog crashed
into the 79th floor of the Empire State Building.


351
0:32:4,619 --> 0:32:13,52
14 people dead, 1 million dollars in damage.
But, the building stands intact to this day.


352
0:32:13,52 --> 0:32:20,62
On February 14th, 1975, a three alarm fire broke out
between in the 9th and 14th floors in the North Tower.


353
0:32:20,62 --> 0:32:24,72
According to the New York Times, "The fire leads to intense
scrutiny of the towers "


354
0:32:24,72 --> 0:32:29,521
" and eventually to a decision to install sprinklers. "


355
0:32:29,521 --> 0:32:36,521
On May 4th, 1988, a 62 storey skyscraper in Los Angeles
burned for 3 hours and spread over 4 floors.


356
0:32:36,521 --> 0:32:39,521
It did not collapse.


357
0:32:39,521 --> 0:32:45,622
On February 23rd, 1991, a 38 storey skyscraper in Philadelphia,
built in 1973,


358
0:32:45,622 --> 0:32:52,422
burned for more than 19 hours and spread over 8 floors.
It did not collapse.


359
0:32:52,422 --> 0:32:58,522
On October 17th, 2004, a 56 storey skyscraper in Venezuela,
built in 1976,


360
0:32:58,522 --> 0:33:4,523
burned for over 17 hours and spread over 26 floors,
eventually reaching the roof.


361
0:33:4,523 --> 0:33:7,523
Guess what?
It did not collapse.


362
0:33:7,523 --> 0:33:15,423
On February 12th, 2005, the Windsor Building in Madrid,
a 32 storey tower framed in steel reinforced concrete,


363
0:33:15,423 --> 0:33:20,724
burned for almost 24 hours, completely eradicating
the upper 10 stories of the building.


364
0:33:20,724 --> 0:33:28,424
Although the top 10 floors of the building fell,
the building itself did not collapse.


365
0:33:28,424 --> 0:33:35,525
And yet on September 11th, 2001, two 110 storey skyscrapers,
completed in 1973,


366
0:33:35,525 --> 0:33:41,325
burned for 56 minutes and 103 minutes respectively,
over 4 floors,


367
0:33:41,325 --> 0:33:44,625
before collapsing completely to the ground.


368
0:33:44,625 --> 0:33:48,526
One might argue, that this was due to the construction
of the World Trade Center.


369
0:33:48,526 --> 0:33:52,526
Let's look at, what was inside those buildings.


370
0:33:52,526 --> 0:34:0,726
The Twin Towers were composed of 200,000 tons of steel,
425,000 cubic yards of concrete,


371
0:34:0,726 --> 0:34:6,427
103 elevators, 43 600 windows,


372
0:34:6,427 --> 0:34:9,227
60 000 tons of cooling equipment,


373
0:34:9,227 --> 0:34:13,627
and a 360 foot  television antenna.


374
0:34:13,627 --> 0:34:17,627
The core of each tower was 87 by 133 feet,


375
0:34:17,627 --> 0:34:24,628
comprised of 47 box columns 36 by 16 inches thick.


376
0:34:24,628 --> 0:34:29,828
The North Tower was completed in 1970
standing at 1368 feet tall


377
0:34:29,828 --> 0:34:35,729
and the South Tower was completed in 1973
clocking in at 1362 feet tall,


378
0:34:35,729 --> 0:34:43,529
making them the tallest buildings in the world
until the Sears Tower was completed in 1974.


379
0:34:43,529 --> 0:34:47,629
And to think... the government want
have us believe that these massive structures


380
0:34:47,629 --> 0:34:49,929
were destroyed by 10 000 gallons of jet fuel.


381
0:34:49,929 --> 0:34:57,63
However, eyewitnesses, video footage and a little
common sense quickly refutes that claim.


382
0:34:57,63 --> 0:35:14,431
The second plane hits the South Tower between the 78th
and 82nd floors at 9:03 AM,


383
0:35:14,431 --> 0:35:22,532
barely hitting the southeast corner, the majority of the jet fuel
exploding outside in a massive fireball.


384
0:35:22,532 --> 0:35:26,632
Yet, this Tower collapses first, even though
the North Tower was hit straight on,


385
0:35:26,632 --> 0:35:30,532
and had already been burning for 18 minutes longer.


386
0:35:30,532 --> 0:35:37,233
Galileio's Law of Falling Bodies calculates the time in which
an object will travel a certain distance in complete freefall.


387
0:35:37,233 --> 0:35:41,933
Distance (D) = 16.08 times Time in seconds squared.


388
0:35:41,933 --> 0:35:45,633
The South Tower was 1362 feet tall.


389
0:35:45,633 --> 0:36:5,634
1362 = 16.08 times 84.70.
Or, 9.2 seconds.


390
0:36:5,634 --> 0:36:8,935
The Twin Towers came down in nearly freefall speed.


391
0:36:8,935 --> 0:36:13,35
200,000 tons of steel shatters into sections no longer
than a couple feet long.


392
0:36:13,35 --> 0:36:18,535
425,000 cubic yards of concrete is pulverized into dust.


393
0:36:18,535 --> 0:36:22,435
Thousands of lives are extinguished instantly.


394
0:36:22,435 --> 0:36:24,536
So what brought down the World Trade Center?


395
0:36:24,536 --> 0:36:26,536
Let's ask the experts.


396
0:36:26,536 --> 0:36:31,936
Van Romero. Vice President for Research at New Mexico
Institute of Mining and Technology.


397
0:36:31,936 --> 0:36:36,536
" My opinion is, based on the videotapes,
after the airplanes hit the World Trade Center "


398
0:36:36,536 --> 0:36:40,36
" there were some explosive devices inside
that caused the towers to collapse. "


399
0:36:40,36 --> 0:36:45,237
" The collapses were  too methodical to be a chance result
of airplanes colliding with the structures. "


400
0:36:45,237 --> 0:36:49,37
Ten days later.
" Certainly the fire is what caused the building to fail. "


401
0:36:49,37 --> 0:36:52,437
Why would Romero change his mind so suddenly?


402
0:36:52,437 --> 0:36:56,538
Hyman Brown. Civil Engineering Professor
and the World Trade Center's construction manager.


403
0:36:56,538 --> 0:37:3,938
" It was over-designed to withstand almost anything including
hurricanes, high winds, bombings and an airplane hitting it... "


404
0:37:3,938 --> 0:37:9,38
" Although the buildings were designed to withstand
"a 150-year storm" and the impact of a Boeing 707, "


405
0:37:9,38 --> 0:37:13,439
" jet fuel burning at 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit
weakened the steel. "


406
0:37:13,439 --> 0:37:19,39
Kevin Ryan. Underwriters Laboratories, the company that
certified the steel that was used in the World Trade Center,


407
0:37:19,39 --> 0:37:23,539
in a letter to Frank Gayle of the National Institute
of Standards and Technology.


408
0:37:23,539 --> 0:37:27,64
" We know that the steel components were certified
to ASTM E119. "


409
0:37:27,64 --> 0:37:34,54
" The time temperature curves for this standard require the samples
to be exposed to temperatures around 2000F for several hours. "


410
0:37:34,54 --> 0:37:38,4
" And as we all agree, the steel applied met those specifications. "


411
0:37:38,4 --> 0:37:42,4
" Additionally, I think we can all agree that even
un-fireproofed steel "


412
0:37:42,4 --> 0:37:46,541
" will not melt until reaching red-hot temperatures
of nearly 3000F. "


413
0:37:46,541 --> 0:37:53,441
Why Dr. Brown would imply that 2000F would melt
the high-grade steel used in those buildings makes no sense at all.


414
0:37:53,441 --> 0:37:55,641
" This story just does not add up. "


415
0:37:55,641 --> 0:38:0,542
" If steel from those buildings did soften or melt, I'm sure we can
all agree that this was certainly not due "


416
0:38:0,542 --> 0:38:6,142
" to jet fuel fires of any kind, let alone the briefly
burning fires in those towers. "


417
0:38:6,142 --> 0:38:10,842
Ryan's statements directly contradict statements from
so-called "experts",


418
0:38:10,842 --> 0:38:16,543
which claim that 2000 degree heat inside the
WTC caused the towers to collapse.


419
0:38:16,543 --> 0:38:21,343
Days after writing this letter, Kevin Ryan was
fired from his position.


420
0:38:21,343 --> 0:38:22,943
Not even the experts agree with each other.


421
0:38:22,943 --> 0:38:27,643
So what else could have caused
the Twin Towers and Building 7 to collapse?


422
0:38:27,643 --> 0:38:32,244
" 10 o'clock eastern time this morning
just collapsing on itself. "


423
0:38:32,244 --> 0:38:36,444
" The second building that was hit by the plane
has just completely collapsed. "


424
0:38:36,444 --> 0:38:38,744
" We have no idea what caused this. "


425
0:38:38,744 --> 0:38:42,544
" Almost looks like one of those planned implosions. "


426
0:38:42,544 --> 0:38:46,845
" As if a demolition team set off,
when you see the whole demolitions of whole buildings. "


427
0:38:46,845 --> 0:38:49,745
" It folded down on itself
and it was not there anymore. "


428
0:38:49,745 --> 0:38:55,45
" If you wish to bring anybody who's ever watched
a building being demolished on purpose "


429
0:38:55,45 --> 0:38:58,645
" knows , that if you're going to do this, you have to get at the "


430
0:38:58,645 --> 0:39:2,346
" at the under infrastructure of a building and bring it down. "


431
0:39:2,346 --> 0:39:7,46
" We heard another explosion and I'm assuming
that's the one that came from the lower level. "


432
0:39:7,46 --> 0:39:11,46
" Since there were two..."
" Right, cause it was like 18 minutes apart. "


433
0:39:11,46 --> 0:39:16,646
" Well... this is, no the first, the first explosion
and there was the second explosion in the same building. "


434
0:39:16,646 --> 0:39:18,247
" There were 2 explosions. "


435
0:39:18,247 --> 0:39:22,947
" Federal Agencies that were down there do believe that
there was some sort of explosive device, "


436
0:39:22,947 --> 0:39:25,147
" somewhere else besides the planes hitting. "


437
0:39:25,147 --> 0:39:29,847
" NBC's Pat Dawson is close to the scene of that attack, Pat? "


438
0:39:29,847 --> 0:39:36,248
" Just moments ago I spoke to the Chief of Safety
for the New York City Fire Department, "


439
0:39:36,248 --> 0:39:41,548
" the Chief Albert Turi, he received word of the possibility
of the secondary device "


440
0:39:41,548 --> 0:39:46,648
" that is another bomb going off, he tried to get his
men out as quickly as he could, "


441
0:39:46,648 --> 0:39:49,449
" but he said that there was another explosion which took place "


442
0:39:49,449 --> 0:39:55,549
" and then, an hour after the first hit here,
the first crash that took place, he said "


443
0:39:55,549 --> 0:39:59,649
" there was another explosion that took place "


444
0:39:59,649 --> 0:40:5,55
" in one of the Towers here. He thinks that there were actually
devices that were planted in the building, "


445
0:40:5,55 --> 0:40:12,35
" The second device, he thinks, he speculates,
was probably planted in the building. "


446
0:40:12,35 --> 0:40:17,5
" There were two or three similar huge explosions
and the building "


447
0:40:17,5 --> 0:40:20,951
" literally shook, it literally
shook at the base of this building. "


448
0:40:20,951 --> 0:40:25,51
" First one and then the other,
some say after secondary explosions. "


449
0:40:25,51 --> 0:40:31,951
" ...big explosion happened, all of a sudden the elevator blew up,
smoke, I dragged the guy out, his skin was hanging off, "


450
0:40:31,951 --> 0:40:35,51
" and I dragged him out and I helped him
to the ambulance. "


451
0:40:35,51 --> 0:40:40,452
" We started coming down the stairs from the eighth floor.
Big Explosion. Blew us back into the eighth floor. "


452
0:40:40,452 --> 0:40:45,752
" Just came out of the tunnel, and it blew. "
" The subway tunnel?" " Yeah. "


453
0:40:45,752 --> 0:40:47,552
" So, tell us what's happening out there."


454
0:40:47,552 --> 0:40:54,953
" We just witnessed some kind of secondary, follow up
explosion on the World Trade Center number 2. " "Secondary."


455
0:40:54,953 --> 0:40:59,53
" We understand now there has been a secondary
explosion on Tower 2. "


456
0:40:59,53 --> 0:41:6,153
" There was another major explosion. The building itself, literally
the top of it came down sending smoke and debris everywhere. "


457
0:41:6,153 --> 0:41:8,754
" We are five blocks from the World Trade Center. "


458
0:41:8,754 --> 0:41:14,954
" And, and we were standing here, when, when there was
some sort of collapse, or explosion. "


459
0:41:14,954 --> 0:41:18,454
" Do you know if it was an explosion,
or if it was a building collapse? "


460
0:41:18,454 --> 0:41:23,455
" To me it sounded like, to me it sounded like
an explosion ... "


461
0:41:23,455 --> 0:41:26,555
" We heard a big explosion coming down. "


462
0:41:26,555 --> 0:41:33,455
" Everything it went black. Everything came down, glass
started popping, people got hurt, stuff went on top of them, "


463
0:41:33,455 --> 0:41:38,355
" and there was a big explosion, and everything got dark.
Real dark like smoke. "


464
0:41:38,355 --> 0:41:44,556
" The FBI is here as you can see, they had roped this area off,
they were taking photographs and securing this area. "


465
0:41:44,556 --> 0:41:49,156
" Just prior to that huge explosion that we all heard
and felt. "


466
0:41:49,156 --> 0:41:53,56
" Get out of the area.
The second Tower is coming down. "


467
0:41:53,56 --> 0:41:55,557
" Did they tell you the second Tower is coming down? "
" Yes, it's about to collapse. "


468
0:41:55,557 --> 0:42:0,657
" At 10:30 I tried to leave the building.
As soon as I got outside I heard a second explosion. "


469
0:42:0,657 --> 0:42:6,657
" And another rumble, and more smoke, and more dust.
I ran inside the building, the chandelier shook "


470
0:42:6,657 --> 0:42:13,758
" and again black smoke filled the air. Within another 5 minutes
we were covered again with more silt and more dust. "


471
0:42:13,758 --> 0:42:21,458
" And then a Fire Marshall came in and said we had to leave,
because if there was a third explosion this building might not last. "


472
0:42:21,458 --> 0:42:25,558
" We just saw that as well, the second Tower "


473
0:42:25,558 --> 0:42:31,959
" the only one that was standing, Tower number one just ah we
saw some kind of explosion a lot of smoke come out of the top "


474
0:42:31,959 --> 0:42:35,759
" of the Tower, and then it collapsed down onto the
streets below. "


475
0:42:35,759 --> 0:42:37,959
" David Lee, what can you tell us? "


476
0:42:37,959 --> 0:42:44,96
" John, just seconds ago there was a huge explosion and it
appears right now the second World Trade Tower has just collapsed. "


477
0:42:44,96 --> 0:42:50,6
One eyewitness was standing among a crowd of people
on Church Street, two and a half blocks from the South Tower,


478
0:42:50,6 --> 0:42:55,16
when he saw a number of brief light sources being
emitted from inside the building between floors 10 and 15.


479
0:42:55,16 --> 0:43:2,61
He saw about six of these flashes, accompanied by a crackling
sound before the Tower collapsed.


480
0:43:2,61 --> 0:43:9,761
Ginny Carr was attending a business  meeting on the 36th floor
of One Liberty Plaza, across the street from the WTC, and caught the entire first attack on tape.


481
0:43:9,761 --> 0:43:28,462
A second explosion can be heard nine
seconds after the crash.


482
0:43:28,462 --> 0:43:32,163
" ...sounded like some crash... "


483
0:43:32,163 --> 0:43:35,863
So, what happened in the North Tower?
Ask Willy Rodriguez.


484
0:43:35,863 --> 0:43:42,963
Willy, a janitor who worked in the World Trade Center
for 20 years was in sub level 1 when the North Tower was hit.


485
0:43:42,963 --> 0:43:45,664
" And all of a sudden we heard boom! "


486
0:43:45,664 --> 0:43:49,964
" And I thought it was a generator that
blew up in the basement. "


487
0:43:49,964 --> 0:43:53,964
" And I said to myself: Oh my God,
I think that's the generator. "


488
0:43:53,964 --> 0:43:58,264
" And I was going to verbalize it, and when I finished
saying that in my mind, I hear boom! "


489
0:43:58,264 --> 0:44:2,265
" Right on the top. Pretty far away. "


490
0:44:2,265 --> 0:44:7,265
" So, it was a difference between coming from
the basement and coming from the top. "


491
0:44:7,265 --> 0:44:14,265
" And thats..., everybody started screaming. And a person comes
running into the office saying: Explosion, explosion, explosion! "


492
0:44:14,265 --> 0:44:18,966
" He had his hands extended. And all the skin
was falling from under his arm. "


493
0:44:18,966 --> 0:44:22,566
" All the way to the top of the fingertips.
And it was hanging from both arms. "


494
0:44:22,566 --> 0:44:28,66
"Hanging and hanging. And then I looked at his face
and he was missing parts of his face. "


495
0:44:28,66 --> 0:44:34,767
" And I said: What happened? What happened? "
" And he said: The elevators, the elevators. " "And then..."


496
0:44:34,767 --> 0:44:40,67
" When I..., there were many explosions, and when I actually
talked about those explosions, they said that: "


497
0:44:40,67 --> 0:44:43,467
" Well, there were so many kitchens in the building. "


498
0:44:43,467 --> 0:44:47,267
" They have probably those gas canisters. "


499
0:44:47,267 --> 0:44:52,68
" And I say: I don't believe that, because the building
was a class A building. "


500
0:44:52,68 --> 0:44:55,168
" They have very strict guidelines of what you can
put in a kitchen. "


501
0:44:55,168 --> 0:44:58,768
" And I really doubt it was gas. "


502
0:44:58,768 --> 0:45:4,69
" So, there was a lot of misconceptions of what happened
on that day in terms of the explosions. "


503
0:45:4,69 --> 0:45:11,69
" Up to today, I haven't received an actual explanation about
the different explosions that I heard on the upper floors. "


504
0:45:11,69 --> 0:45:14,869
" And on the way to the top. "


505
0:45:14,869 --> 0:45:21,17
The windows in the lobby of the North Tower were blown out,


506
0:45:21,17 --> 0:45:25,77
and marble panels were blown off of the walls.


507
0:45:25,77 --> 0:45:31,27
This was brushed off as damage from a raging fireball
that went barreling down the elevator schafts.


508
0:45:31,27 --> 0:45:36,971
However, the World Trade Center's core
and elevator shafts were hermetically sealed, AKA, air-tight.


509
0:45:36,971 --> 0:45:42,71
The fire could not possibly have had enough oxygen
to travel 1,300 feet down,


510
0:45:42,71 --> 0:45:48,471
retaining enough energy to destroy the bottom 8 floors of
the building.


511
0:45:48,471 --> 0:45:53,272
On 9-11, New York City lost 343 firefighters
at the World Trade Center.


512
0:45:53,272 --> 0:45:57,72
Since they were the ones inside the Towers before
and as they collapsed,


513
0:45:57,72 --> 0:46:0,572
I'd say they've got a pretty good grasp on what happened.


514
0:46:0,572 --> 0:46:8,973
So, what does the FDNY think? First, we have this interview
from the Naudet brothers' documentary.


515
0:46:8,973 --> 0:46:14,573
" ...what do we do? We made it outside, we made it
about a block? " " We made it at least 2 blocks "


516
0:46:14,573 --> 0:46:18,973
" and we started running.. boom-boom-boom-boom.
Floor by floor it started popping out. "


517
0:46:18,973 --> 0:46:24,474
" It was like, as if they had detonated? " " Yeah, detonated."
" Take out the building. Boom-boom-boom-boom. "


518
0:46:24,474 --> 0:46:27,274
"...all the way down, I was watching it and running."


519
0:46:27,274 --> 0:46:31,374
" And then you just saw this cloud of shit chasing you down. "


520
0:46:31,374 --> 0:46:32,774
" Could not ... "


521
0:46:32,774 --> 0:46:37,974
In these interviews, numerous members of Engine 7
describe explosions preceeding the collapses.


522
0:46:37,974 --> 0:46:41,275
not to mention the damage to the lobby of the North Tower.


523
0:46:41,275 --> 0:46:44,375
" I heard a loud boom. And my first ..."


524
0:46:44,375 --> 0:46:49,475
" I was, I was right at the desk there on
the lefthand side when you come into Tower 1. "


525
0:46:49,475 --> 0:46:55,576
" And I walked out, you know I didn't go out
I walked to where all the doorway, where the glass was broken, "


526
0:46:55,576 --> 0:46:59,76
" and I looked out and I've seen in the building across the street. "


527
0:46:59,76 --> 0:47:4,76
" I seen the shadow coming like the, I seen the shadow
on a building across the street "


528
0:47:4,76 --> 0:47:5,576
" coming down. "


529
0:47:5,576 --> 0:47:9,577
" I wasn't expecting to see the damage that I saw in the lobby. "


530
0:47:9,577 --> 0:47:15,777
" And, and the people, the bodies, the burned people,
the injured people, "


531
0:47:15,777 --> 0:47:17,677
" I really wasn't prepared for that. "


532
0:47:17,677 --> 0:47:22,77
" The lobby was about 6 storeys high and the
lobby looked as though a bomb had exploded there."


533
0:47:22,77 --> 0:47:27,478
" It's a... all the glass was taken out, there were
10 foot by 10 foot, "


534
0:47:27,478 --> 0:47:31,478
" a marble panels that were once walls "


535
0:47:31,478 --> 0:47:37,78
" that were loose from the wall of the Trade Center. "


536
0:47:37,78 --> 0:47:42,479
" I went around by the freight elevator
and I could see it was just blown. "


537
0:47:42,479 --> 0:47:47,579
" 30th floor. We hear another ...explosion. "


538
0:47:47,579 --> 0:47:53,679
" And at that time we heard a huge explosion. "


539
0:47:53,679 --> 0:47:56,79
Firefighter Louie Cacchioli told People Weekly:


540
0:47:56,79 --> 0:48:1,18
" I was taking firefighters up in the elevator to the 24th floor
to get in position to evacuate workers. "


541
0:48:1,18 --> 0:48:7,48
On the last trip up a bomb went off. We think there were
bombs set in the building.


542
0:48:7,48 --> 0:48:14,381
For more than a year, the Port Authority blocked the release of a
tape of firefighters' transmissions from the World Trade Center on 9-11.


543
0:48:14,381 --> 0:48:21,381
In November 2002, the tape was released to the New
York Times and other "news outlets."


544
0:48:21,381 --> 0:48:26,981
Why did it take so long to get the tape released?


545
0:48:26,981 --> 0:48:33,482
" I got, uh, an eyewitness who said there was
an explosion on floors 7 and 8, 7,8. "


546
0:48:33,482 --> 0:48:38,82
" Battalion 3 to Dispatch, we've just had another explosion. "


547
0:48:38,82 --> 0:48:40,682
" ...Warren Street, because of the secondary explosion. "


548
0:48:40,682 --> 0:48:44,383
" We've got numerous people covered with dust
from the secondary explosion. "


549
0:48:44,383 --> 0:48:48,83
" We got another explosion on the Tower, 10-13, 10-13. "


550
0:48:48,83 --> 0:48:53,183
" Tower 2 has had a major explosion and what appears to be
a complete collapse surrounding the entire area. "


551
0:48:53,183 --> 0:48:59,583
" I was involved in the secondary, uh, explosion
at Tower 1, Kay..."


552
0:48:59,583 --> 0:49:6,484
Chief Palmer had reached the fire on the 78th floor of the
South Tower and devised a plan to put it out.


553
0:49:6,484 --> 0:49:12,84
" ... Ladder 15, we've got two isolated pockets of fire. "


554
0:49:12,84 --> 0:49:19,485
" We should be able to knock it down with two lines.
Radio that, 78th floor numerous 10-45 Code Ones. "


555
0:49:19,485 --> 0:49:25,685
If the 78th floor was a raging inferno like the government would
have us believe, then Palmer wouldn've got as far as he did


556
0:49:25,685 --> 0:49:29,585
and certainly wouldn't be able to put it out.


557
0:49:29,585 --> 0:49:36,86
On August 12th, 2005 an additional 15 hours of radio
transmissions and transcripts of interviews with firefighters


558
0:49:36,86 --> 0:49:40,586
was finally released to the public.


559
0:49:40,586 --> 0:49:44,386
Firefighters describe 2 events consistent with the
controlled demolition:


560
0:49:44,386 --> 0:50:0,587
Bright flashes from inside the building


561
0:50:0,587 --> 0:50:24,489
and a number of crackling sounds
before the buildings collapsed.


562
0:50:24,489 --> 0:50:27,589
What does science have to say about the collapses?


563
0:50:27,589 --> 0:50:33,89
The collapse of the World Trade Center was picked up by
Columbia University's observatory in Palisades, New York.


564
0:50:33,89 --> 0:50:36,69
The South Tower registers at 2.1 earthquake.


565
0:50:36,69 --> 0:50:40,49
The North Tower registers at 2.3 earthquake.


566
0:50:40,49 --> 0:50:46,19
Won-Young Kim told Chris Bollyn that their seismographs
pick up underground explosions from a quarry 20 miles away.


567
0:50:46,19 --> 0:50:53,791
These blasts are caused by 80,000 lbs of ammonium nitrate
and cause local earthquakes between Mag. 1 and 2.


568
0:50:53,791 --> 0:50:59,291
The 1993 bombing of the WTC did not even
register, because it was not coupled to the ground.


569
0:50:59,291 --> 0:51:4,591
During the collapse, most of the energy of the falling debris
was absorbed by the Towers and the neighboring structures


570
0:51:4,591 --> 0:51:11,592
converting them into rubble and dust or causing other damage
but not causing significant ground shaking.


571
0:51:11,592 --> 0:51:17,592
Mark Loizeaux, the president of Controlled Demolition, Inc.
told the American Free Press that in the basements of the WTC,


572
0:51:17,592 --> 0:51:21,593
where 47 central support columns connected to the
bedrock,


573
0:51:21,593 --> 0:51:26,593
hot spots of "literally molten steel"
were discovered more than a month after September 11th.


574
0:51:26,593 --> 0:51:32,493
These incredibly hot areas were found at
the bottoms of the elevator shafts down 7 basement levels.


575
0:51:32,493 --> 0:51:37,794
The molten steel was found "three, four,
and five weeks later, when the rubble was being removed. "


576
0:51:37,794 --> 0:51:42,794
He said that molten steel was also found at World Trade Center 7.


577
0:51:42,794 --> 0:51:50,294
The highest temperature was in the east corner of the
South Tower, where a temperature of 1377F was recorded.


578
0:51:50,294 --> 0:51:55,495
The molten steel in the basement was more
than double that temperature.


579
0:51:55,495 --> 0:51:59,395
Do you still think that jet fuel brought down
the World Trade Center?


580
0:51:59,395 --> 0:52:6,495
In all the videos of the collapses explosions can be seen
bursting from the buildings 20 to 30 storeys below the demolition wave.


581
0:52:6,495 --> 0:52:17,196
Here.


582
0:52:17,196 --> 0:52:27,497
Here.


583
0:52:27,497 --> 0:52:36,497
Here.


584
0:52:36,497 --> 0:52:42,698
Here.


585
0:52:42,698 --> 0:52:53,898
Here.


586
0:52:53,898 --> 0:53:0,199
And here.


587
0:53:0,199 --> 0:53:4,299
Etienne Sauret was filming her documentary,
World Trade Center: The First 24 Hours,


588
0:53:4,299 --> 0:53:12,8
and caught both collapses on tape.
Watch carefully.


589
0:53:12,8 --> 0:53:20,9
The tripod shakes 12 seconds before the
North Tower begins collapsing.


590
0:53:20,9 --> 0:53:34,1
And something is knocked off
the right hand side of the building.


591
0:53:34,1 --> 0:53:39,601
You're probably asking, if there were bombs in the building,
how would they get in there without anyone noticing?


592
0:53:39,601 --> 0:53:45,602
Ben Fountain, a financial analyst who worked in the World Trade
Center, told People Magazine that in the weeks before 9-11,


593
0:53:45,602 --> 0:53:55,702
there were a number of unannounced and unusual drills where
sections of both the Twin Towers and building 7 were evacuated for 'security reasons'.


594
0:53:55,702 --> 0:54:2,803
Daria Coard, a guard in the North Tower, told Newsday that
security detail was working 12 hour shifts for two weeks before 9-11,


595
0:54:2,803 --> 0:54:7,603
but on Thursday the 6th, bomb sniffing dogs
were abruptly removed from the bulding.


596
0:54:7,603 --> 0:54:10,703
So who authorized all this?


597
0:54:10,703 --> 0:54:18,604
President Bush's brother, Marvin, was Board of Directors
at Securacom from 1993 until fiscal year 2000.


598
0:54:18,604 --> 0:54:25,104
Securacom, now known as Stratesec, is an electronic
security company backed by Kuwait-American corporation,


599
0:54:25,104 --> 0:54:33,5
which provided security for United Airlines, Dulles International Airport,
and from the early 1990s up to the day of 9-11, the World Trade Center..


600
0:54:33,5 --> 0:54:39,605
Marvin is also the former director at HCC Insurance Holdings,
which insured parts of the World Trade Center on 9-11.


601
0:54:39,605 --> 0:54:43,105
More information on this was supposed
to be disclosed and never was.


602
0:54:43,105 --> 0:54:47,506
To date the SEC has not revealed what they have learned.


603
0:54:47,506 --> 0:54:51,406
If only we could examine the debris from the World Trade Center
and figure out what happened.


604
0:54:51,406 --> 0:54:59,106
Unfortunately, Mayor Giuliani began shipping the remains off to
recycling yards overseas before investigators could even examine it.


605
0:54:59,106 --> 0:55:1,807
Not even FEMA was allowed into Ground Zero.


606
0:55:1,807 --> 0:55:5,607
Essentially, they blocked off a crime scene
and destroyed all the evidence.


607
0:55:5,607 --> 0:55:8,107
Guess who was allowed into the site?


608
0:55:8,107 --> 0:55:13,907
Controlled Demolition, who was also responsible for cleaning up
after the Oklahoma City Bombing in 1995.


609
0:55:13,907 --> 0:55:17,808
It gets better than that.
On July 15th, 2001


610
0:55:17,808 --> 0:55:23,808
Controlled Demolition destroyed two 400 ft tall
fuel reserve tanks from the World War II era.


611
0:55:23,808 --> 0:55:28,608
The demolition was conducted for no apparent reason,
and drew numerous complains from the nighborhood.


612
0:55:28,608 --> 0:55:34,9
The site remains vacant to this day
and a reason for the demolition has never been disclosed.


613
0:55:34,9 --> 0:55:38,109
Regardless, I think what happened to the
World Trade Center is simple enough.


614
0:55:38,109 --> 0:55:41,409
It was brought down in a carefully planned controlled demolition.


615
0:55:41,409 --> 0:56:7,711
It was a psychological attack on the American People,
and it was pulled off with military precision.


616
0:56:7,711 --> 0:56:11,511
10:06 AM.  Shanksville, Pennsylvania.


617
0:56:11,511 --> 0:56:16,111
Flight 93 was en route from New Jersey to California
with 45 passengers,


618
0:56:16,111 --> 0:56:21,112
when it went off course at 8:56 over Cleveland, Ohio.


619
0:56:21,112 --> 0:56:24,812
According to the official story, Flight
93 was headed for the White House


620
0:56:24,812 --> 0:56:30,712
when it was overpowered by a group of passengers
and crashed in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.


621
0:56:30,712 --> 0:56:35,612
Out of all the events of 9-11, the one
that has caused the most confusion is Flight 93.


622
0:56:35,612 --> 0:56:38,113
It was shot down, it wasn't shot down.


623
0:56:38,113 --> 0:56:44,513
However, evidence suggests that perhaps
Flight 93 was nowhere near Shanksville.


624
0:56:44,513 --> 0:56:51,113
" I wanna get quickly to Chris Chaniki he's a photographer
with the Pittsburgh affiliate a Fox affiliate. "


625
0:56:51,113 --> 0:56:54,614
" He was back there just a couple minutes ago and Chris,
I've seen the pictures "


626
0:56:54,614 --> 0:56:57,614
" it looks like there's nothing there, except for a hole in the ground. "


627
0:56:57,614 --> 0:57:3,114
" Basically that's right, the only thing you can see from
where we were was a big gouge in the earth "


628
0:57:3,114 --> 0:57:4,514
" and some broken trees. "


629
0:57:4,514 --> 0:57:10,815
You could see some people working, walking around in the area,
but from where we can see there wasn't much left. "


630
0:57:10,815 --> 0:57:12,615
" Any large pieces of debris at all? "


631
0:57:12,615 --> 0:57:16,915
" No, there was nothing. Nothing, that you can distinguish that
a plane had crashed there. "


632
0:57:16,915 --> 0:57:22,515
" Smoke, fire? "
" Nothing, it was absolutely quiet, it was actually very quiet. "


633
0:57:22,515 --> 0:57:27,316
" Nothing going on down there, no smoke, no fire, just a couple
of people walking around "


634
0:57:27,316 --> 0:57:31,216
" They look like part of the NTSB crew. Walking around,
looking at the pieces. "


635
0:57:31,216 --> 0:57:33,316
" How big would you say that hole was? "


636
0:57:33,316 --> 0:57:37,516
" From my estimates, I would guess it was probably
around 20 to 15 feet "


637
0:57:37,516 --> 0:57:41,617
" long, and probably about 10 feet wide. "


638
0:57:41,617 --> 0:57:45,117
" What could you see on the ground  if anything
other than dirt and ash and...? "


639
0:57:45,117 --> 0:57:52,117
" You couldn't see anything. You just see dirt, ash and
people walking around, broken trees. "


640
0:57:52,117 --> 0:57:58,618
Wally Miller, a Somerset County coroner, told the Houston Chronicle
"It looked like somebody just dropped a bunch of metal out of the sky. "


641
0:57:58,618 --> 0:57:59,818
In the Washington Post...


642
0:57:59,818 --> 0:58:4,518
"It looked like someone took a scrap truck, dug a 10-foot ditch
and dumped trash into it."


643
0:58:4,518 --> 0:58:6,118
And as for the passengers...


644
0:58:6,118 --> 0:58:10,218
" I stopped being coroner after about 20
minutes, because there were no bodies there. "


645
0:58:10,218 --> 0:58:11,819
In the Pittsburg Review...


646
0:58:11,819 --> 0:58:17,719
"I have not, to this day, seen a single
drop of blood. Not a drop."


647
0:58:17,719 --> 0:58:22,119
It would seem that, on one day, for the second time in history,


648
0:58:22,119 --> 0:58:26,52
an entire plane, along with its passengers,
disappeared upon impact.


649
0:58:26,52 --> 0:58:29,82
" ... No signs of any survivors at the site of the
Nigerian plane crash "


650
0:58:29,82 --> 0:58:33,62
" that is the word from the Red Cross, which has
a representative on site. "


651
0:58:33,62 --> 0:58:39,32
" The first pictures of the crash scene show a large crater
where the Boeing 737 broke into the small pieces. "


652
0:58:39,32 --> 0:58:42,821
" The plane crashed shortly after taking off from Lagos
in a heavy storm. "


653
0:58:42,821 --> 0:58:50,21
" The flight was going to the Nigerian capital of Abuja and
was believed to be carrying some senior Nigerian officials."


654
0:58:50,21 --> 0:58:53,521
So if Flight 93 didn't go down in Shanksville, then where?


655
0:58:53,521 --> 0:58:56,121
You ready for this?  Cleveland.


656
0:58:56,121 --> 0:59:1,722
At 11:43 on September 11th, WCPO, a local TV station
in Cincinatti, Ohio,


657
0:59:1,722 --> 0:59:6,322
reported that two planes landed at Cleveland Hopkins Airport
due to a bomb threat.


658
0:59:6,322 --> 0:59:10,122
United Airlines identified one of the planes as Flight 93.


659
0:59:10,122 --> 0:59:14,123
Are you confused?  Well, it gets better.
Check it out.


660
0:59:14,123 --> 0:59:23,523
At approximately 10 AM, Cleveland Hopkins Airport was
evacuated, amidst rumors that a hijacked plane was going to land.


661
0:59:23,523 --> 0:59:30,724
Passengers had to leave, but couldn't drive.
They had to walk or hitchhike.


662
0:59:30,724 --> 0:59:37,724
Buses weren't allowed to leave.
People were sent home.


663
0:59:37,724 --> 0:59:47,425
According to Associated Press and local Ohio papers,
one plane landed at approximately 10:45.


664
0:59:47,425 --> 0:59:53,425
But Delta Airlines confirmed that their plane, Delta 1989,
landed in Cleveland at 10:10.


665
0:59:53,425 --> 0:59:57,725
Therefore, Flight 93 landed at Cleveland
at approximately 10:45.


666
0:59:57,725 --> 1:0:3,826
Authorities searched Delta 1989 for over two hours,
and passengers were questioned individually.


667
1:0:3,826 --> 1:0:7,526
The Plain Dealer reported
that the plane was evacuated at 12:30.


668
1:0:7,526 --> 1:0:13,526
But the Akron Beacon reports that a plane was evacuated at 11:15.
Which would make that Flight 93.


669
1:0:13,526 --> 1:0:18,527
Mayor White reported that the plane had 200 passengers.


670
1:0:18,527 --> 1:0:22,327
But a passenger from
Delta 1989 describes "60 or so" passengers.


671
1:0:22,327 --> 1:0:27,127
So at 11:15, 200 or so
passengers were released from Flight 93.


672
1:0:27,127 --> 1:0:31,527
The passenger from Delta 1989 states that she
was taken into FAA headquarters.


673
1:0:31,527 --> 1:0:36,128
But other reports say that passengers were brought
into the NASA Glenn Research Center


674
1:0:36,128 --> 1:0:41,528
located near the west end of the airport,
which had already been evacuated.


675
1:0:41,528 --> 1:0:42,628
So, to sum up.


676
1:0:42,628 --> 1:0:46,928
Delta 1989 landed at
10:10, was evacuated at 12:30,


677
1:0:46,928 --> 1:0:54,429
almost two and a half hours later,
and 69 passengers were taken to FAA Headquarters.


678
1:0:54,429 --> 1:1:0,529
Flight 93 landed at 10:45 and evacuated
within a half hour,


679
1:1:0,529 --> 1:1:5,53
200 or so passengers quickly taken to an
empty NASA Research Center.


680
1:1:5,53 --> 1:1:13,43
Why did it take 140 minutes to evacuate 69 passengers,
when 200 were evacuated in a half hour?


681
1:1:13,43 --> 1:1:16,83
We can assume that the passengers from
Delta 1989 are safe somewhere.


682
1:1:16,83 --> 1:1:22,431
The question remains, what happened to the
200 or so passengers from Flight 93?


683
1:1:22,431 --> 1:1:27,931
It's interesting to note that the combined total of all
the passengers from all four flights is 198.


684
1:1:27,931 --> 1:1:32,31
Or 243.
Depending on who you ask.


685
1:1:32,31 --> 1:1:35,532
We may never know what really happened to Flight 93.


686
1:1:35,532 --> 1:2:9,534
But we do know what didn't
happen.


687
1:2:9,534 --> 1:2:16,434
Whenever this evidence is presented to people,
you'll usually get one of many different questions.


688
1:2:16,434 --> 1:2:21,734
The first one being, if different planes were used,
what happened to the original ones?


689
1:2:21,734 --> 1:2:25,335
Unfortunately, we may never know
what really happened.


690
1:2:25,335 --> 1:2:28,435
But if we could examine the black boxes
from the planes that were used,


691
1:2:28,435 --> 1:2:33,35
we could prove that they weren't the original flights.


692
1:2:33,35 --> 1:2:36,135
A commercial plane carries two different black boxes.


693
1:2:36,135 --> 1:2:42,936
Each black box carries one of two different recorders,
a cockpit voice recorder and a flight data recorder.


694
1:2:42,936 --> 1:2:50,36
The cockpit voice recorder records sounds from inside the cockpit,
including engine noise, stall warnings, and other sounds of interest.


695
1:2:50,36 --> 1:2:57,537
Communications between Air Traffic Control, weather briefings
and conversations between pilots and crew are also recorded.


696
1:2:57,537 --> 1:3:3,537
The flight data recorder records at least 28 different parameters
such as time, altitude, speed and heading.


697
1:3:3,537 --> 1:3:11,538
Some also record more than 300 other in flight characteristics,
anything from auto-pilot to smoke alarms.


698
1:3:11,538 --> 1:3:15,138
The recorders themselves are made from
the most impervious metals known to man,


699
1:3:15,138 --> 1:3:19,638
and the information is recorded along with date and time,
and spooled into a continuous roll.


700
1:3:19,638 --> 1:3:26,539
Any damage that is done to the roll is done to the outside,
as opposed to the inside where the data is.


701
1:3:26,539 --> 1:3:34,539
The 9-11 Commission says "The CVRs and FDRs from
American 11 and United 175 were not found..."


702
1:3:34,539 --> 1:3:40,639
Yet, the FBI claims to have found the passport of
Satam al-Suqami, which managed to fly out of his pocket,


703
1:3:40,639 --> 1:3:45,54
through the explosion and onto the streets of
Manhattan below.


704
1:3:45,54 --> 1:3:51,14
So, four different black boxes, made from
the most resiliant materials known to man, were destroyed.


705
1:3:51,14 --> 1:3:57,141
Yet, a passport, made from a fragile material known as paper,
managed to survive?


706
1:3:57,141 --> 1:4:0,541
Who writes this stuff?


707
1:4:0,541 --> 1:4:4,941
Ted Lopatkiewicz, spokesman for the National Transportation
Safety Board, told CBS News that


708
1:4:4,941 --> 1:4:13,542
"It's extremely rare that we don't get the recorders back.
I can't recall another domestic case in which we did not recover the recorders."


709
1:4:13,542 --> 1:4:18,842
Turns out Ted's right.  Nicholas DeMasi, a firefighter who
helped the recovery efforts claims in the book


710
1:4:18,842 --> 1:4:23,42
Behind the Scenes: Ground Zero, "At one point I was
assigned to take Federal Agents around the site


711
1:4:23,42 --> 1:4:29,543
to search for the black boxes from the planes. There were a
total of four black boxes. We found three."


712
1:4:29,543 --> 1:4:33,443
I guess it all comes down to who you'd rather believe.


713
1:4:33,443 --> 1:4:38,143
FBI Director Robert Mueller said Flight 77's data recorder
provided altitude,


714
1:4:38,143 --> 1:4:42,643
speed, headings and other information,
but the voice recorder contained nothing useful.


715
1:4:42,643 --> 1:4:49,544
And Donald Rumsfeld said the data on the
cockpit voice recorder was unrecoverable.


716
1:4:49,544 --> 1:4:53,544
As for Flight 93, it was the only flight where
the cockpit voice recorded was recovered.


717
1:4:53,544 --> 1:4:59,244
It was played for the families in April, 2002, but not before they
signed an agreement saying that they wouldn't talk about it.


718
1:4:59,244 --> 1:5:1,545
They couldn't even take notes.


719
1:5:1,545 --> 1:5:5,445
And for some reason, the last three
minutes of the tape was unaccounted for.


720
1:5:5,445 --> 1:5:9,545
The FBI had no explanation for the
discrepancy.


721
1:5:9,545 --> 1:5:14,545
Why would the 9-11 Commission tell us Flight 11
and 175's recorders weren't found?


722
1:5:14,545 --> 1:5:18,546
Why would Robert Mueller tell us that there's nothing
interesting on Flight 77s?


723
1:5:18,546 --> 1:5:22,246
What's on the last three minutes
of Flight 93's CVR?


724
1:5:22,246 --> 1:5:26,646
These are vital questions that need to be answered.


725
1:5:26,646 --> 1:5:32,47
It's an interesting postscript that Flight 93 was spotted on
April 10th, 2003 at Chicago's O'Hare Airport,


726
1:5:32,47 --> 1:5:36,347
by David Friedman, a United Airlines
employee who records all of his flights.


727
1:5:36,347 --> 1:5:45,547
The tail number, N591UA was spotted on
Flight 1111, a United Airlines 757.


728
1:5:45,547 --> 1:5:54,348
And according the FAA, both N591UA and N612UA,
Flights 93 and 175, are still valid.


729
1:5:54,348 --> 1:6:0,948
But Flights 11 and 77 are listed as destroyed.


730
1:6:0,948 --> 1:6:8,549
Not to mention that they were not even scheduled
to fly on September 11th.


731
1:6:8,549 --> 1:6:12,49
Next.  What about the cell phone calls?


732
1:6:12,49 --> 1:6:15,149
For starters, the calls themselves are
extremely peculiar.


733
1:6:15,149 --> 1:6:22,65
Most of them are only a couple sentences long, before the
callers end the conversation, only to call back later.


734
1:6:22,65 --> 1:6:26,45
Flight Attendant Betty Ong allegedly placed a call from Flight 11.


735
1:6:26,45 --> 1:6:32,55
According to the 9-11 Commission, although the conversation
lasted 23 minutes, only 4 and a half minutes was recorded.


736
1:6:32,55 --> 1:6:35,851
" What is your name? "
" Ok, my name is Betty Ong. "


737
1:6:35,851 --> 1:6:39,651
" I'm number 3 on Flight 11. "
" Okay. "


738
1:6:39,651 --> 1:6:45,151
" And the cockpit is not answering their phone.
And there's somebody stabbed in business class. "


739
1:6:45,151 --> 1:6:49,451
" And there's... we can't breathe in business class.
Somebody's got mace or something. "


740
1:6:49,451 --> 1:6:55,52
" Okay. Our number 1 got stabbed. Our purser is stabbed. "


741
1:6:55,52 --> 1:7:0,652
" Nobody knows who is stabbed who, and we can't even get up
to business class right now cause nobody can breathe. "


742
1:7:0,652 --> 1:7:4,52
" Our number 1 is stabbed right now. And who else is... "


743
1:7:4,52 --> 1:7:7,653
"Okay, and do we... "
" and our number 5 - our first class passengers are - "


744
1:7:7,653 --> 1:7:16,653
" galley flight attendant and our purser has been stabbed.
And we can't get into the cockpit, the door won't open. "


745
1:7:16,653 --> 1:7:21,53
Does Ms. Ong sound like a woman on a
hijacked plane who just saw three people murdered?


746
1:7:21,53 --> 1:7:24,654
Why is nobody in the background screaming?


747
1:7:24,654 --> 1:7:30,554
Flight attendant Madeline Sweeney allegedly talked with her
ground manager Michael Woodward for 25 minutes.


748
1:7:30,554 --> 1:7:33,754
She describes 4 hijackers.
The FBI says there were 5.


749
1:7:33,754 --> 1:7:39,655
She says the hijackers were in rows 9 and 10.
The FAA says there were all in row 8.


750
1:7:39,655 --> 1:7:45,155
Near the end, she screams, "I see buildings.  Water.
Oh my God!"


751
1:7:45,155 --> 1:7:51,855
Madeline was a flight attendant out of Boston for 12 years.
I think she would have recognized Manhattan.


752
1:7:51,855 --> 1:7:56,556
A man claiming to be Mark Bingham called his mother, Alice,
who was visiting his sister-in-law.


753
1:7:56,556 --> 1:7:59,556
The caller says,
"Mom? This is Mark Bingham."


754
1:7:59,556 --> 1:8:3,956
When was the last time you called your
mother and used your full name?


755
1:8:3,956 --> 1:8:7,556
" I just want to tell you that I love you.
I'm on a flight from Newark to San Francisco "


756
1:8:7,556 --> 1:8:11,657
" and there are three guys on board and they have taken
over the plane and they say they have a bomb. "


757
1:8:11,657 --> 1:8:16,657
" I'm calling you from the Airfone,"  and then
" You believe me, don't you, Mom? "


758
1:8:16,657 --> 1:8:19,757
" Yes Mark, I believe you, who are these guys? "


759
1:8:19,757 --> 1:8:25,558
Then he was interrupted by someone who was speaking
in a low-toned male voice, speaking what sounded like English.


760
1:8:25,558 --> 1:8:30,58
After 30 seconds of muffled sounds, the caller repeats
" I'm calling you with an Airfone. "


761
1:8:30,58 --> 1:8:33,458
His mother asks him again, " Who are these guys? "


762
1:8:33,458 --> 1:8:37,558
After another pause he returns and asks
again, " You believe me, don't you, Mom? "


763
1:8:37,558 --> 1:8:41,359
There was another pause, and the phone just trailed off.


764
1:8:41,359 --> 1:8:47,559
To date, none of the calls, except for Betty Ong's call to
American Airlines, has been released to the public.


765
1:8:47,559 --> 1:8:50,59
But to be honest, none of that matters.


766
1:8:50,59 --> 1:8:53,659
Why?
Because none of these calls could have taken place.


767
1:8:53,659 --> 1:8:59,6
Kee Dewdney of Physics911.net conducted
some research of his own.


768
1:8:59,6 --> 1:9:4,36
In an experiment called Project Achilles, he took a series
of cell phones onto a Cessna 172


769
1:9:4,36 --> 1:9:8,76
and flew up to 8,000 feet to determine the success
rate as the plane got higher.


770
1:9:8,76 --> 1:9:15,661
At 4,000 feet he had a .4 success rate.
At 8,000 feet he had a .1 success rate.


771
1:9:15,661 --> 1:9:23,161
For 32,000 feet, cruising altitude for a commercial airliner,
he calculated a .006 success rate.


772
1:9:23,161 --> 1:9:26,661
less than one in a
hundredth of a chance.


773
1:9:26,661 --> 1:9:30,862
Don't believe me?  Even American Airlines
has put their foot in the government's mouth.


774
1:9:30,862 --> 1:9:35,762
On July 15th, 2004, passengers aboard a commercial
American Airlines flight were able to send


775
1:9:35,762 --> 1:9:42,963
and receive calls from their cell phones as if they were on the ground,
thanks to a cell station that was installed into the plane.


776
1:9:42,963 --> 1:9:47,363
" It worked great. I called the office. I called my wife.
I called a friend in Paris. "


777
1:9:47,363 --> 1:9:50,63
" They all heard me great, and I could hear them loud and clear."


778
1:9:50,63 --> 1:9:55,163
Why would American Airlines spend thousands
of dollars on this technology in 2004


779
1:9:55,163 --> 1:9:59,564
when cell phones worked so well on September 11th, 2001?


780
1:9:59,564 --> 1:10:2,764
The cell phone calls were fake.
No question about it.


781
1:10:2,764 --> 1:10:5,764
So how is it possible to fake a person's voice?


782
1:10:5,764 --> 1:10:11,764
In 1999, the Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico
revealed their voice morphing technology.


783
1:10:11,764 --> 1:10:17,365
General Carl W. Steiner, the former Commander-in-chief
of U.S. Special Operations declared on tape:


784
1:10:17,365 --> 1:10:22,565
" Gentlemen! We have called you together to inform you
that we are going to overthrow the United States government. "


785
1:10:22,565 --> 1:10:27,865
Another example was Colin Powell saying,
" I am being treated well by my captors. "


786
1:10:27,865 --> 1:10:34,466
With just a 10-minute recording of somebody's voice,
they are able, in almost real time, to clone someone's speech.


787
1:10:34,466 --> 1:10:38,566
Steiner was so impressed, he asked for a
copy.


788
1:10:38,566 --> 1:10:41,166
So what about the hijackers?


789
1:10:41,166 --> 1:10:46,567
On September 14th, 2001, the Department of Justice
released the names of the alleged 19 hijackers.


790
1:10:46,567 --> 1:10:55,767
But on September 23rd, the BBC reported that
Waleed Al Shehri was alive and well in Casablanca, Morrocco.


791
1:10:55,767 --> 1:11:2,568
They also tracked down Abdulaziz Alomari, who is an engineer
with Saudi Telecoms, and lost his passport while studying in Denver.


792
1:11:2,568 --> 1:11:9,568
In the same article, FBI Director Robert Mueller admitted
that " the identity of several of the hijackers is in doubt."


793
1:11:9,568 --> 1:11:13,768
So how many hijackers turned up alive?
At least 9 of them.


794
1:11:13,768 --> 1:11:18,169
Wail M. Alshehri is alive and well.


795
1:11:18,169 --> 1:11:22,269
Mohand Alshehri is alive in Saudi Arabia.


796
1:11:22,269 --> 1:11:26,369
Khalid Almihdhar is a computer programmer
in Mecca.


797
1:11:26,369 --> 1:11:31,369
Salem Alhazmi works at a chemical plant
in Yanbu, Saudi Arabia.


798
1:11:31,369 --> 1:11:35,27
Saeed Alghamdi is training to be a pilot in Tunis.


799
1:11:35,27 --> 1:11:39,7
Ahmed Alnami is an administrative supervisor for Saudi Airlines.


800
1:11:39,7 --> 1:11:42,27
We already covered Waleed and Abdulaziz.


801
1:11:42,27 --> 1:11:48,7
And last but not least, Mohammed Atta's
father claimed to receive a phone call from his son on September 12th.


802
1:11:48,7 --> 1:11:56,771
On September 20th and 27th, Mueller admitted on CNN that
there is "no legal proof to prove the identities of the hijackers" .


803
1:11:56,771 --> 1:12:3,871
Indeed.  After all, not even the official
autopsy for Flight 77 lists the hijackers,


804
1:12:3,871 --> 1:12:7,872
and the opening paragraph
makes no mention of their absence.


805
1:12:7,872 --> 1:12:14,272
So if there's no proof that the hijackers were members of Al Qaeda
or if they were even on the plane in the first place,


806
1:12:14,272 --> 1:12:17,872
what justification do we have for bombing Afghanistan?


807
1:12:17,872 --> 1:12:23,873
Oh, that's right. The Bin Laden confession tape.


808
1:12:23,873 --> 1:12:30,973
On December 14th, 2001, the government released a tape,
allegedly of bin Laden confessing to the attacks of 9/11,


809
1:12:30,973 --> 1:12:34,273
which they claimed to find in a house in Jalalabad, Afghanistan.


810
1:12:34,273 --> 1:12:38,874
Except there's a number of things wrong with this tape.


811
1:12:38,874 --> 1:12:41,974
One, the tape itself is of very poor quality.


812
1:12:41,974 --> 1:12:48,974
And two, the man in the video
looks and acts nothing like bin Laden.


813
1:12:48,974 --> 1:12:55,75
According to the FBI's website, Osama is
left-handed.


814
1:12:55,75 --> 1:13:1,75
Yet, in this video, he is
writing a note with his right hand.


815
1:13:1,75 --> 1:13:7,175
Not to mention he's wearing a gold ring, which is
forbidden by Islamic law,


816
1:13:7,175 --> 1:13:10,676
and is never mentioned in the FBI's
description of him.


817
1:13:10,676 --> 1:13:15,476
Compare this video to four other pictures
of bin Laden.


818
1:13:15,476 --> 1:13:18,476
Does anybody else see a
problem here?


819
1:13:18,476 --> 1:13:23,76
Until the government can prove without a shadow of a doubt
that Al-Qaeda was behind September 11th,


820
1:13:23,76 --> 1:13:59,579
the American people have
every reason to believe otherwise.


821
1:13:59,579 --> 1:14:2,679
And now for the last question of all.


822
1:14:2,679 --> 1:14:6,379
Why would our government do such a thing?


823
1:14:6,379 --> 1:14:9,779
I hope you're sitting down.


824
1:14:9,779 --> 1:14:16,58
First, we have Larry Silverstein, the man who purchased
the World Trade Center in July, 2001.


825
1:14:16,58 --> 1:14:21,58
After September 11th, Silverstein
demanded $7.2 billion dollars form his insurers,


826
1:14:21,58 --> 1:14:24,98
claiming that each plane counted as a separate act of terrorism.


827
1:14:24,98 --> 1:14:32,981
However, on December 6th, 2004, the courts only
rewarded him with $2.2 billion dollars.


828
1:14:32,981 --> 1:14:37,881
Next we have the put options that were placed on
United Airlines, American Airlines, and Boeing.


829
1:14:37,881 --> 1:14:44,582
According to the San Fransisco Chronicle,
more than $2.5 Million dollars has remained unclaimed.


830
1:14:44,582 --> 1:14:47,182
As for 9-11 itself...


831
1:14:47,182 --> 1:14:50,382
Reuters reported that Convar, a German computer company,


832
1:14:50,382 --> 1:14:56,82
is responsible for helping companies and accountants of
New York to restore their data from over 400 hard drives,


833
1:14:56,82 --> 1:14:58,183
that were recovered from the World Trade Center's rubble.


834
1:14:58,183 --> 1:15:3,983
Convar recovered information from 32 different computers
hat suggested insider trading took place on 9-11.


835
1:15:3,983 --> 1:15:6,683
Richard Wagner, an expert at Convar,


836
1:15:6,683 --> 1:15:11,383
" There is a suspicion that some people had advance
knowledge of the approximate time of the plane crashes "


837
1:15:11,383 --> 1:15:15,84
" in order to move out amounts exceeding 100 million dollars. "


838
1:15:15,84 --> 1:15:19,684
" They thought that the records of their transactions could
not be traced after the main frames were destroyed."


839
1:15:19,684 --> 1:15:23,584
After their analysis, Convar handed the
results over to the FBI.


840
1:15:23,584 --> 1:15:30,585
Although the FBI was legally bound to investigate who was
responsible, to date they have done no such thing.


841
1:15:30,585 --> 1:15:33,685
Moving on.
According to Wikipedia,


842
1:15:33,685 --> 1:15:37,685
" One of the world's largest gold depositories
was stored underneath the World Trade Center. "


843
1:15:37,685 --> 1:15:45,186
In 1993 the value of the gold was estimated at one billion
dollars, rumored to be owned by Kuwaiti interests.


844
1:15:45,186 --> 1:15:50,686
When the World Trade Center was destroyed,
the amount of gold "far exceeded the 1993 levels."


845
1:15:50,686 --> 1:15:55,586
" The gold was finally recovered in its entirety in late 2001. "


846
1:15:55,586 --> 1:15:57,486
Or was it?


847
1:15:57,486 --> 1:16:3,187
On November 1st, 2001, the TimesOnline reported that a large
amount of gold was discovered in the wreckage of the World Trade Center.


848
1:16:3,187 --> 1:16:9,687
Mayor Rudolph Guiliani announced that
more than $230 million dollars was recovered from Ground Zero.


849
1:16:9,687 --> 1:16:15,487
However, the Comex metals trading division was storing gold
bars for the Bank of Nova Scotia, Chase Manhattan Bank,


850
1:16:15,487 --> 1:16:20,888
the Bank of New York, Hong Kong,
and Shanghai Banking, totaling $950 million dollars.


851
1:16:20,888 --> 1:16:24,88
And that's just one company.


852
1:16:24,88 --> 1:16:29,588
Rumor has it that over $160 billion dollars
in gold were stored in the World Trade Center.


853
1:16:29,588 --> 1:16:33,89
So where did all the gold go?


854
1:16:33,89 --> 1:16:36,189
Remember the gold that was found in November, 2001?


855
1:16:36,189 --> 1:16:39,689
Reuters reported, that it was discovered in the back of a
10 wheel truck,


856
1:16:39,689 --> 1:16:44,389
along with several cars in a delivery tunnel underneath
World Trade Center 5.


857
1:16:44,389 --> 1:16:46,89
No bodies were recovered.


858
1:16:46,89 --> 1:16:51,19
As workers got closer to the gold, authorities began
restricting access to Ground Zero,


859
1:16:51,19 --> 1:16:54,29
joined by FBI and Secret Service agents.


860
1:16:54,29 --> 1:17:1,29
One worker who was directed away from the tunnel told a reporter,
" If I tried to go down there, they would have shot me. "


861
1:17:1,29 --> 1:17:8,91
Heavy-machinery operators and others worked under the
watchful eye of more than 100 armed officers.


862
1:17:8,91 --> 1:17:10,91
So, let me get this straight.


863
1:17:10,91 --> 1:17:18,491
Gold from WTC4 was found underneath WTC5,
in an empty delivery truck, with an empty escort of cars.


864
1:17:18,491 --> 1:17:22,92
I think it's safe to say that they were
running away from the South Tower.


865
1:17:22,92 --> 1:17:29,492
The question is, how did they know to flee from their stash,
when not even the firefighters inside the South Tower expected it to collapse?


866
1:17:29,492 --> 1:17:33,992
167 billion dollars in gold.  200 million
is found.


867
1:17:33,992 --> 1:17:36,193
And that's just the money.


868
1:17:36,193 --> 1:17:41,293
After September 11th, President Bush had and continues to
have permission to do and say whatever he wants,


869
1:17:41,293 --> 1:17:44,893
all under the pretext of 9-11.


870
1:17:44,893 --> 1:17:47,393
The Patriot Act.


871
1:17:47,393 --> 1:17:50,593
The Department of
Homeland Security.


872
1:17:50,593 --> 1:17:52,394
Afghanistan.


873
1:17:52,394 --> 1:18:0,594
Iraq.


874
1:18:0,594 --> 1:18:3,194
It's time for America to accept 9-11 for
what it was:


875
1:18:3,194 --> 1:18:10,595
A lie which killed thousands of people, only in turn killing
hundreds of thousands more, to make billions upon trillions of dollars.


876
1:18:10,595 --> 1:18:14,595
Are you angry yet?  You should be.


877
1:18:14,595 --> 1:18:19,695
Every single attempt to investigate and uncover the truth
behind 9-11 has been blackballed, ridiculed,


878
1:18:19,695 --> 1:18:23,796
and harassed by both the government and media alike,
for even daring to question the official story.


879
1:18:23,796 --> 1:18:27,396
" Jimmy Walter, you spent nearly 2 million dollars on an
advertising blitz  "


880
1:18:27,396 --> 1:18:32,96
" to convince people here in New York and elsewhere that
9-11 was a self-inflicted wound. "


881
1:18:32,96 --> 1:18:34,796
" Jimmy, welcome. Why are you doing this? "


882
1:18:34,796 --> 1:18:38,897
" I'm a patriot trying to defend this country
from the real terrorists, "


883
1:18:38,897 --> 1:18:43,197
" who have damaged and changed our country.
I am asking the same questions "


884
1:18:43,197 --> 1:18:49,97
" that the widows and orphans, parents and friends
of the victims of 911 are asking, "


885
1:18:49,97 --> 1:18:54,698
" and have not had answered by either the 911 comission,
nor by any real investigation "


886
1:18:54,698 --> 1:19:1,98
" to the mass murders, that 66% of New Yorkers
want investigated. "


887
1:19:1,98 --> 1:19:6,498
I'll say it again.  Why are they hiding from us?
What are they hiding from us?


888
1:19:6,498 --> 1:19:10,799
And what's it going to take until people in this country give
a damn and do something about it?


889
1:19:10,799 --> 1:19:15,599
America has been hijacked. Not by Al Qaeda.
Not by Osama bin Laden.


890
1:19:15,599 --> 1:19:20,899
But by a group of tyrans, ready and willing to
do whatever it takes to keep their stranglehold on this country.


891
1:19:20,899 --> 1:19:22,699
So what are we going to do about it?


892
1:19:22,699 --> 1:19:27,1
Anything.  Share this information with
friends, family, total strangers.


893
1:19:27,1 --> 1:19:31,2
Hold screenings, conferences, whatever
you have to do to get the word out.


894
1:19:31,2 --> 1:19:33,0
It's up to you.


895
1:19:33,0 --> 1:21:33,0
Ask questions.  Demand answers.
