###23 SHANE SMITH: Getting into Sudan was really difficult.
###25 We had to fly to London and wait at the Sudanese embassy.
###28 Our contact in Sudan had talked to the ambassador.
###32 And so the ambassador had talked to some minister that
###36 our contact's father was friends with.
###38 So we're waiting.
###39 And I'm like, there's no way this is going to happen.
###41 And at the 11th hour, we got the visa.
###44 They said OK, got on a plane, and then flew
###47 from there to Khartoum.
###49 And the minute you get off the plane, you're like, what's
###53 happening here?
###54 Because everyone's in the jalabiya.
###56 Everyone's got turbans.
###58 There's no foreign people there.
###60 There's no white people there.
###62 It's a very deserty airport, very empty, very hot, at least
###67 in the Sahara.
###67 Lots of security, lots of different--
###70 There's the police.
###71 There's the army.
###72 There's the secret police.
###73 There's this.
###73 There's that.
###74 We talked to our fixer.
###76 And she said, oh by the way, you might get all of your
###78 camera gear confiscated and thrown in jail.
###80 But don't worry, I'll get you out.
###82 So we were terrified the minute we got there that we
###84 were going to get everything taken away from us.
###86 But when we went through, it was 4:00 in the morning.
###87 So they were just tired and bored.
###89 So they just said, OK, well, go through.
###91 Then they never checked our bags, which was fantastic.
###94 We've been told that we should get some bilaja--
###98 bilajabiya?
###98 FEMALE SPEAKER: Jalabiya.
###99 SHANE SMITH: Jalabiya.
###101 So that we fit in a little bit more.
###103 We don't cause so much consternation.
###105 The minute we get out of the car here, we're the focus of a
###108 lot of attention because they don't get a lot
###110 of foreigners here.
###111 They're suspicious of foreigners.
###113 My pink Irish face is not going to
###115 do much in a jalabiya.
###117 But we're going to give it a shot.
###120 And we're going to check out the market.
###122 JAMIE-JAMES MEDINA: It's not as tight as I
###124 thought it would be.
###125 SHANE SMITH: Am I fitting in?
###127 
###143 All of a sudden, the Sudanese thought that was so funny, to
###146 see Americans dressed up like them, that
###149 they were a lot nicer.
###151 When we had to get the press credentials, we met the
###153 Secretary General of the Ministry of Information.
###156 And he was dressed in the exact same tribal garb.
###158 I just grabbed some stuff.
###160 But we had dressed in the exact same tribal garb.
###162 So he loved me and said, oh great.
###164 You should go to my friend the sheikh's
###166 place to see a madrasa.
###168 The madrasa is a religious school where you
###170 just learn the Koran.
###171 Pakistani madrasas were where the Taliban came out of, which
###174 were a lot of terrorists come out of.
###175 And they are an ideological training ground for
###177 terrorists, et cetera, et cetera.
###179 So Sudan, which is incredibly closed towards Western media,
###182 and then a Sudanese madrasa of children who have been
###185 orphaned by the Darfur conflict is a huge coup.
###190 [SUDANESE MUSIC PLAYING]
###206 SHANE SMITH: A lot of the kids from Darfur come here, and
###211 they get put up by the sheikh.
###213 And they just learn the Koran.
###215 That's it.
###215 The sheikh Is a rich guy, but he's also a
###219 religious leader, right.
###220 Well, these kids' parents have been slaughtered.
###222 He brings them and he feeds them and clothes them, if they
###226 learn the Koran.
###227 Just the Koran.
###228 There's no geography.
###229 There's no mathematics.
###230 There's no foreign language.
###231 There's no nothing.
###232 [SUDANESE MUSIC PLAYING]
###254 SHANE SMITH: So as you're walking through there, you
###256 really get a chill, because you realize the world has
###259 totally polarized.
###260 And there is Muslim world, non-Muslim world, the rich
###263 world, the poor world.
###264 And as you walk through there, and you see that division so
###267 clearly defined, it gives you a shiver.
###270 And you say, wow.
###271 When I walked out of there, I was blown away.
###276 I got back into the car.
###278 And there were these thousands of kids still burned into my
###280 head as they were going back and forth, back and forth.
###282 And a lot of times they were looking at us.
###284 And they are looking at us with hatred.
###286 And they're eight years old.
###288 [SUDANESE MUSIC PLAYING]
###313 SHANE SMITH: As heavy as the madrasa was, we went the next
###316 day to see the alternative.
###317 And it was even worse.
###319 
###329 We're here with the Lost Boys who have been displaced by the
###332 war in the South and in Darfur.
###335 And they come here.
###336 They live in a market just over here.
###337 And a lot of them are addicted to solvents.
###340 But they're here playing soccer.
###342 And we're going to see them do some dancing.
###346 BARBARA GOULDSBURY: We have a drop-in center, a learning
###348 center, a vocational school, and a residential center here.
###352 SHANE SMITH: And what are they set up to do exactly?
###354 BARBARA GOULDSBURY: The learning center is set up to
###356 take kids off the street who have had no education or
###359 little education to get them up to an age and a stage where
###362 they can be reentered into the regular school system.
###364 SHANE SMITH: And most of these kids are solvent addicts?
###367 BARBARA GOULDSBURY: The older boys that you see around here
###369 are living on the streets and the market, and they are
###371 addicted to solvent abuse, yes.
###372 SHANE SMITH: How do they live?
###373 How do they get food?
###376 BARBARA GOULDSBURY: They beg.
###377 They steal.
###378 They come here daily for food.
###379 They get a regular meal here.
###382 And apart from that, they just eat what they can
###384 get from the market.
###385 SHANE SMITH: Right.
###386 And they live here as well, some of them?
###388 BARBARA GOULDSBURY: Some of them do.
###388 33 of them do.
###389 But the older boys that you see [INAUDIBLE], they live in
###392 the market.
###393 SHANE SMITH: OK.
###394 
###398 MALE SPEAKERS: [SPEAKING SUDANESE ARABIC]
###429 SHANE SMITH: All these kids, they live in the market.
###430 They all live on the streets.
###432 How you doing?
###433 You all right?
###435 OK.
###437 So as we're hanging out and watching them do their dancing
###439 and stuff, we realize that all these little boys are totally
###442 addicted to sniffing glue.
###443 And do you sniff glue as well?
###446 MALE SPEAKER 1: [SPEAKING SUDANESE ARABIC]
###448 RAZAN AHMED: He said he's doing it now.
###450 SHANE SMITH: Now.
###451 Yeah.
###451 RAZAN AHMED: That I do it because it balances my head.
###455 It makes me feel more calm.
###457 SHANE SMITH: And what do you think about here saying you
###461 shouldn't do glue?
###462 RAZAN AHMED: [SPEAKING SUDANESE ARABIC]
###466 MALE SPEAKER 1: [SPEAKING SUDANESE ARABIC]
###468 RAZAN AHMED: He said he knows he shouldn't smoke it.
###470 And he knows that what Barbara's saying is right.
###474 But he gets worried and he gets stressed out when he
###478 doesn't do it.
###479 And he's relaxed.
###482 SHANE SMITH: What is he worried about?
###483 RAZAN AHMED: [SPEAKING SUDANESE ARABIC]
###487 MALE SPEAKER 1: [SPEAKING SUDANESE ARABIC]
###491 RAZAN AHMED: He said it's nothing really [INAUDIBLE].
###494 It's nothing really something in his life
###497 that's bothering him.
###498 It's more to do with--
###500 He feels like it's a physical thing.
###504 He can't breathe properly.
###505 He doesn't sleep well.
###508 If he goes a day without sniffing, he starts shaking.
###513 SHANE SMITH: Does he know that he's addicted?
###515 RAZAN AHMED: [SPEAKING SUDANESE ARABIC]
###518 MALE SPEAKER 1: [SPEAKING SUDANESE ARABIC]
###521 RAZAN AHMED: He says he's fully aware.
###523 And he knows he's never going to leave it.
###526 SHANE SMITH: Is he high right now?
###528 RAZAN AHMED: [SPEAKING SUDANESE ARABIC]
###530 MALE SPEAKER 1: [SPEAKING SUDANESE ARABIC]
###533 RAZAN AHMED: He said, yeah I just had some.
###535 The rest is outside.
###536 SHANE SMITH: He just coughed glue into my
###538 face, this guy here.
###539 He said he's not on glue.
###542 RAZAN AHMED: [SPEAKING SUDANESE ARABIC]
###545 SHANE SMITH: He just coughed a whole model airplane on me.
###548 RAZAN AHMED: [SPEAKING SUDANESE ARABIC]
###553 BOY: [SPEAKING SUDANESE ARABIC]
###558 RAZAN AHMED: He's saying, no.
###560 No, no, no.
###561 It's not me.
###561 I'm not.
###562 And everyone in the background is saying, yeah you are.
###564 SHANE SMITH: Yeah, well I could smell it.
###566 He's coughing.
###566 RAZAN AHMED: He knows, because everyone's laughing at him.
###569 He's just trying to deny it.
###571 SHANE SMITH: When you see kids, it's always the heaviest
###576 part, because they've done nothing.
###577 And whatever it is, land, or greed, or any kind of--
###582 it's usually money.
###584 And you see what the ramifications are, which are
###589 four-year-old boys living in the street.
###591 We'd only been in Sudan a few days, and we'd already seen
###594 hundreds of displaced people, and a lot of orphans, and the
###596 Lost Boys addicted to glue.
###599 And we wanted to go out and talk to people and see what
###602 they thought about what was happening,
###604 what was causing this.
###605 [SUDANESE MUSIC PLAYING]
###626 SHANE SMITH: We're here at a displaced persons camp.
###629 2 million people have been displaced from the war on
###632 Darfur, but also another 4 million from
###634 the war in the South.
###635 They come to places like this in the middle of the desert.
###638 A lot of the houses are made from wattle and daub, from
###641 manure, from hay, whatever they can find.
###645 They estimate around 300,000 people live here.
###648 And we're going to tour around and talk to people from the
###651 South and from Darfur about what they've done.
###654 It's just so makeshift.
###656 It's like Star Wars.
###657 
###663 Pretty heavy to be here.
###665 I was thinking about that last night, how North America and
###669 Europe, you get so used to just booze, and food, and
###673 coke, and parties, supermodels.
###675 How you doing brother?
###677 And here it's just water, food.
###684 You're afraid to touch anything because you're
###686 worried of getting diseases.
###688 
###693 Hi.
###694 Hi.
###694 [SINGING SUDANESE SONG]
###783 SHANE SMITH: We hear in America that the conflict in
###787 Darfur is racial in nature, Arab on black.
###790 And when we were in the IDP camp, there were Arabs, there
###793 were blacks.
###794 There was actually 40 or 50 different tribes that all
###797 co-exist and that all get along.
###799 
###801 OLGA EUNICE ODERA: We have so far about 56
###805 tribes living here.
###806 SHANE SMITH: 56.
###807 OLGA EUNICE ODERA: And they are from the 25 states.
###811 SHANE SMITH: And so we started having some questions of, why
###814 is this actually happening in Darfur?
###815 What's really happening?
###816 So we started asking the people if
###818 they had any answers.
###819 Some people say it's racial.
###821 Some people say it's economic.
###822 Some people say it's political.
###824 People in the South say one thing.
###825 People in Khartoum say another thing.
###828 And I'm just trying to find out what the general consensus
###830 of why it's happening is.
###832 
###836 SHANE SMITH: We started hearing a lot of rumors about
###838 finding oil in Darfur.
###840 So we went into the camp to meet some people from Darfur
###843 and hear what their stories were.
###844 We're going to our friend's house.
###846 He's from Darfur.
###848 He was just telling us that the Janjaweed said, we want
###851 you to go because you're black.
###853 But they were the same color.
###854 And even in Khartoum the Arabs are black.
###858 So he's saying, he's not stupid.
###859 He understands that they're just telling him that.
###862 But they want him to go for another reason because they
###864 want the land.
###866 
###887 SHANE SMITH: He had members of his family, young babies,
###890 thrown into fire.
###892 His father was killed.
###893 His family was killed.
###895 And he was kicked out of his land.
###897 And what we were just talking about after that was in the
###901 South, we saw that the informal militias started
###904 coming when Chevron discovered oil, kicking people off their
###908 land, starting a 20 year civil war.
###911 And now what's happened is they just found oil in Darfur.
###914 And a lot of people say that the problem
###916 in Darfur is racial.
###917 But when we talked to a lot of people, they say we
###919 found oil in Darfur.
###920 And then it became much more serious of a problem.
###923 They want the land.
###924 They want the land for cattle.
###925 They want the land for oil.
###926 This is what's happening.
###927 And it already happened in the South.
###928 Everybody here knows it.
###930 But no one is reporting on that for some reason.
###933 So after hearing about finding oil in Darfur and hearing that
###937 it was so similar to what had already happened down South,
###939 we decided to go to the Unity State where they first found
###942 oil and check out what had happened there.
###944 [SUDANESE MUSIC PLAYING]
###954 SHANE SMITH: I don't even know what I'm allowed to say.
###957 That's kind of a funny thing, because it
###959 was all pretty weird.
###961 Jamie-James just knew this girl.
###963 And we went there.
###964 And she just organized everything.
###966 We've been on our own UN plane.
###968 I probably shouldn't say that.
###970 We're getting on a helicopter.
###971 We're going out to Bentiu, which is one
###974 of the Unity States.
###976 They have oil.
###977 And this is where the whole conflict
###979 started because of oil.
###980 We got to get on right now.
###981 They're freaking out.
###982 But it's all about oil.
###985 Oil started everything.
###986 Ben Anderson had told us, he goes, oh yeah, you'll see a
###989 Russian helicopter.
###990 And they crash all the time because they're really old.
###992 The Russians just give really old helicopters.
###994 Sure enough, we got on this Russian helicopter.
###996 And it's really old and it's shaking around.
###998 And we were going to Bentiu.
###1001 Bentiu is in southern Sudan.
###1004 And we get to this camp in the middle of
###1007 nowhere, and we land.
###1008 And we're walking up, and we just see these really super
###1012 tall Africans, like you would see on a National Geographic
###1016 thing, looking in the barbed wire.
###1018 And it's just a little camp.
###1020 It's like MASH 4077 just plopped down in
###1023 the middle of Africa.
###1024 We're in the middle of nowhere.
###1026 JAMIE-JAMES MEDINA: Literally nowhere.
###1028 SHANE SMITH: This is where it all started,
###1029 were the oil was found.
###1031 That's where the first well-- it's called the unity well--
###1034 was sunk.
###1036 And it was sunk by Chevron.
###1038 
###1048 SHANE SMITH: So the Americans left during the war, and then
###1051 the Chinese came back?
###1052 CHARLES: Yes.
###1053 SHANE SMITH: They found oil there.
###1054 Then paramilitary groups just started kicking
###1056 everybody off the land.
###1058 They took the oil.
###1059 It used to be Chevron.
###1060 Now America's in disfavor.
###1062 So now it's all going to Chinese
###1063 and Malaysian companies.
###1065 So we're standing here in front of one
###1066 of the unity wells.
###1068 A lot of people think in America that the war here is
###1071 racial, between the Arab population from the North and
###1076 the animist population in the South.
###1079 But the war started with the finding the oil here.
###1081 Is that true?
###1083 
###1099 SHANE SMITH: They take the oil.
###1101 
###1107 SHANE SMITH: And they started fighting to get--
###1109 
###1114 SHANE SMITH: '82, '83.
###1116 We have to hurry.
###1117 And we have to get out and in very quickly, because the oil
###1120 security is very tight.
###1121 They don't want us shooting.
###1123 They don't want anybody to know.
###1124 So we have to jump in, jump out, jump in, jump out.
###1127 And no one can see us, otherwise we'd get in a lot of
###1129 trouble and go to jail.
###1131 
###1144 SHANE SMITH: Charles was terrified.
###1146 If they catch you, that's it.
###1147 So we get out of the car, shoot it.
###1149 This is the unity well.
###1150 First thing, Chevron, in, out.
###1152 When we have more time, we went to the villages.
###1154 And that's where it was really sad, because you walk and
###1157 there's just garbage everywhere.
###1158 We're here in Bentiu, which is the capital of the Unity
###1160 State, which is the richest oil concentration in Sudan.
###1166 But as you can see, a lot of the oil money, most of it goes
###1171 north or to China.
###1173 But very little of it is coming here for
###1175 infrastructure, for water, for roads.
###1178 We're just checking it out with our friend Charles who is
###1180 explaining to us the political situation of what's happening.
###1183 
###1188 SHANE SMITH: So most of the oil in all of Sudan is from
###1190 the Unity State, but it looks very poor.
###1192 
###1202 SHANE SMITH: So where does all the money from the oil go?
###1205 
###1226 SHANE SMITH: They don't have water.
###1228 There's a huge malaria epidemic.
###1231 Anybody get any fish?
###1233 So the kids all come fish in polluted water.
###1236 There's a lot of water-borne diseases.
###1239 They use popcorn, and they have a little string.
###1243 They try to get fish out of here.
###1245 The men get water right from here.
###1249 And then they just bring it with a donkey to town and sell
###1254 it untreated, which of course leads to a lot of disease.
###1258 And you're like, hold on.
###1259 You have a ton of oil.
###1260 Shouldn't you have money?
###1262 All the money goes to China, Malaysia, and Khartoum.
###1265 They're supposed to get 2%.
###1266 But they don't have auditing.
###1267 So it's 2% of what?
###1269 
###1292 SHANE SMITH: So they don't get any money.
###1294 And it's unbelievable poverty.
###1297 But right next to oil, right next to these wells.
###1300 And they won't even hire them to work in the camps.
###1303 They only bring in Chinese and Malaysian workers.
###1307 So we're just in the village, and they don't have water.
###1312 So they get just water untreated from the river and
###1314 they sell it to the villagers, which makes
###1317 everybody very sick.
###1318 But even though right down the street there's a brand new
###1323 petrol station for all the trucks.
###1325 The only roads are built for the trucks to come get the
###1329 petrol, which just goes north.
###1331 And you see, oh, they found the oil.
###1334 Paramilitary groups come in, kill everybody, get them off
###1338 the land, take the oil.
###1340 Now, OK, we've got the oil.
###1342 Now then people can come back.
###1344 We don't care.
###1344 It's ours.
###1345 Oh, find the oil in Darfur.
###1347 Send in the paramilitary groups, kill everybody off,
###1350 take the oil.
###1351 They've been doing it for 20 years.
###1352 [SUDANESE MUSIC PLAYING]
###1367 SHANE SMITH: We were driving out to the pyramids.
###1369 And as we were driving out, there was a huge Chinese
###1373 refinery in the middle of the desert.
###1375 Khartoum really doesn't want you to know about oil.
###1378 Because what happened was in the South, Chevron found oil.
###1382 Right after that, paramilitary groups came into the South and
###1386 started just exterminating everybody.
###1388 Why?
###1389 Because they wanted the oil.
###1390 So there's a huge civil war.
###1392 Four million people are killed.
###1393 All the oil is going to Khartoum.
###1395 So the petrol profits are going to Khartoum.
###1399 And then they're buying weapons.
###1400 Why are they buying weapons?
###1401 Because they found oil in Darfur.
###1403 But this is what starts and finishes the whole problem in
###1407 Darfur, the whole problem in southern Sudan.
###1409 It's all about the oil.
###1410 And this is where they refine it right here.
###1412 We're shooting literally for two minutes in the middle of
###1415 the Sahara.
###1415 There's nothing near us.
###1418 We're shooting this refinery.
###1419 I'm saying, OK it's all about oil.
###1420 The war's about oil.
###1421 Bang.
###1422 Out of nowhere, this dude comes screaming up, grabs the
###1424 camera right away, is about to take us into jail, got a gun.
###1428 Thank God we had a Ministry of Information guy to
###1430 say, no, no, no.
###1431 Wait, wait, wait.
###1431 He took the camera back from the guy.
###1433 As they were arguing, we went back into the truck and then
###1435 we just got out of there.
###1436 RAZAN AHMED: Most of the time, they break your camera first
###1439 and then they let you explain.
###1440 Other times, they don't just break your camera, they break
###1443 your bones.
###1444 They beat you up.
###1445 We could've easily gone to jail.
###1447 We were very, very lucky.
###1448 SHANE SMITH: When we finally got to the pyramids, I was so
###1451 happy that I was giddy.
###1452 I was giggling.
###1453 I couldn't stop laughing.
###1454 I was nearly in tears that we weren't
###1456 rotting in a pit somewhere.
###1457 Because when they arrest you in Sudan, you go to jail.
###1460 And you go to jail for life, no trial, no nothing.
###1463 We had to drive four hours through the Sahara to get to
###1468 these pyramids and nobody's here.
###1472 Surprise, surprise.
###1473 In Sudan, you're not allowed to travel outside of Khartoum.
###1476 No one's been here for months.
###1479 So there's just us and a camel guy.
###1483 Yes, hello.
###1483 MALE SPEAKER 2: Hello.
###1484 SHANE SMITH: How are you?
###1485 [ARABIC].
###1487 These are the oldest pyramids in the world apparently.
###1493 Hold on, let me start again.
###1495 It's really hard to stay on up here.
###1498 But these pyramids are older than the pyramids in Egypt.
###1501 They're Nubian pyramids.
###1503 And it shows the state of affairs of tourism in Egypt
###1506 versus tourism in Sudan.
###1508 Because the pyramids in Egypt, it's basically Disneyland.
###1511 And here, as you can see, there's absolutely nobody.
###1513 [SUDANESE MUSIC PLAYING]
###1532 SHANE SMITH: We've been in Sudan for about a week now.
###1534 And we've been afraid the whole time about police, or
###1538 getting caught, or getting our cameras smashed.
###1540 We couldn't really eat anything.
###1542 Water was hard to get, clean water.
###1544 We didn't sleep.
###1545 Our doctors had warned us of worms that fly out of the sand
###1549 into your eye.
###1550 We were worried about malaria.
###1553 We couldn't get boners because of our malaria pills.
###1556 We were just getting at the end of our rope.
###1558 And we're like, wait a minute.
###1559 We haven't even gotten close to Darfur yet, where it was
###1561 really dangerous.
###1563 So we're off to Darfur.
###1565 [SUDANESE MUSIC PLAYING]
###1579 SHANE SMITH: Flying into Al Fashir, which is the political
###1582 capital of Darfur, you see the effects of the conflict
###1585 everywhere.
###1586 First of all, we weren't even allowed into Darfur.
###1588 They had made it illegal for any foreign press to go there.
###1591 The airport was as far as the UN could take us.
###1593 In fact, a National Geographic journalist and his crew had
###1596 just been thrown in jail days before for sneaking into
###1599 Darfur through Chad.
###1600 When we arrived in Al Fashir proper, we weren't allowed to
###1603 shoot any footage.
###1604 Because it was not only illegal to be there, but the
###1606 town was filled with Janjaweed, Sudanese armed
###1609 forces, and SLA.
###1611 The SLA are the rebel militia headed by Minni Minnawi, who
###1614 we had just snuck into Darfur to interview.
###1617 We're here in the headquarters of the SLF slash M to meet
###1620 Minna Minnawi, who is now the fourth most
###1622 powerful man in Sudan.
###1624 He was the main guy fighting Janjaweed.
###1625 And the government has made a peace agreement with him.
###1628 Minnawi, because he fought the Janjaweed, is a hero to some.
###1631 But others, like Amnesty International, accuse him of
###1634 raping and killing civilians as recently as last July.
###1637 So as I was rushed in to do the interview, I
###1639 sat across from him.
###1640 I looked into his face.
###1641 And it was totally, totally fucked up.
###1643 And what do you think--
###1644 I know that Al Jazeera reported that they found oil
###1649 in Darfur, which is why there's a
###1651 lot of these problems.
###1652 Because in the South, in the Unity State, they found oil.
###1656 And then paramilitary groups came to clear people out.
###1659 And now maybe they found oil in Darfur, and paramilitary
###1662 groups like the Janjaweed are clearing people out.
###1664 Do you know anything about that?
###1665 
###1668 
###1700 SHANE SMITH: I don't have a satellite myself.
###1703 And now that you're part of the government, do you see
###1705 that helping the problem in Darfur, political problem?
###1709 
###1713 
###1747 SHANE SMITH: I went out back to where Minnawi's troops were
###1750 singing SLA songs and realized that it was militia men just
###1754 like these who were responsible for the Lost Boys,
###1757 for the refugees in the IDP camps, for taking Rasheed's
###1761 two-month-old brother and throwing him into a fire.
###1764 And from what I've learned in Southern Sudan and seen in Al
###1768 Fashir, it looked to me like this conflict is going to
###1771 continue as long as it is profitable to do so.
###1774
