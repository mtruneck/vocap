###2 (Dr. Jaradat) We live in a world of salt, but we do not recognize it.
###8 (Dr. Cihacek) Once it's salinated, you got a problem.
###11 (Dr. Hopkins) One of the points that many, many farmers have said is
###15 that they're seeing salts in places
###17 that they'd never witnessed problems before.
###19 (Harold Steppuhn) If I'm a producer and on my ground,
###22 I've got a problem with it-- it's not overblown--
###25 that's my livelihood off that land.
###27 
###31 Funding for "Salt of the Earth"
###34 is made possible by an EPA Section 319 grant
###38 administered by the North Dakota Department of Health.
###41 the Eastern North Dakota
###43 Resource Conservation and Development Councils,
###46 with support provided by the...
###47 
###50 ...helping people help the land,
###52 and by the members of Prairie Public.
###55 
###60 It's a waste of fertilizer, seed,
###62 and your time and effort on it.
###64 It went from, I would say 5% to 10% of the farm acres
###70 being affected by salinity to up to 40% to 50%.
###74 Salinity isn't a new problem, it's a worldwide problem
###78 (Matt Olien, narrator) If you've driven by farm fields in the Upper Great Plains,
###82 you've no doubt noticed patches of white,
###84 chalky soil, usually near roads and ditches,
###86 that just doesn't seem to belong,
###88 and doesn't seem to go away.
###90 Farmers wish it would.
###91 It's soil salinity, too much salt in the soil,
###94 and it can prove nearly impossible
###95 to grow a productive crop in those areas.
###98 Overall reduced soil health, so compaction issues,
###102 reduced biological activity.
###104 You don't have as good of soil to till.
###106 It's harder to work the soil.
###108 A lot of that depends on your strategies
###110 you're using for management-- if you're using
###112 conventional tillage or no till or strip till.
###114 But it really depends on the producer
###115 and what they're willing to try.
###117 In my area I would say
###120 over 95% of my fields have salinity,
###123 and 80% of them have visible white spots
###125 that are well in excess of this.
###127 All of my producers are very concerned about it
###130 and are actively looking for answers and trying new things
###133 and trying to seed some cover crops,
###135 trying some crop rotations, trying some limited drainage
###137 when they can get the permission.
###139 So the producer is going to try to pick the crop
###142 that gives him the best option and economic return.
###145 (narrator) Excess Salinity is caused generally
###147 by too wet of conditions resulting in a high water table.
###150 Most agree the problem in the Upper Great Plains
###153 got worse around 1993
###155 when the dry cycle converted to a wet cycle and has never left.
###158 But the problem has been around for centuries.
###162 (Dr. Jaradat) The land in Mesopotamia is very flat,
###167 and irrigating that land created problems
###170 in addition to the high temperature
###173 and high evaporation from the irrigated water.
###176 Salts became concentrated, and the irrigation water
###180 coming from the twin rivers, the Tigris and Euphrates,
###185 enriched that salt in the Mesopotamia plain,
###189 and in less than 1500 years,
###192 the problems started showing up
###195 to the point that most fertile parts
###198 of lower Mesopotamia turned into white crusts.
###201 People went hungry, and cities
###204 and the empires themselves crumbled
###207 because of the loss of their wealth.
###211 (Dr. Cihacek) This is a geologic process
###212 so it's been going on for a long period of time.
###215 We've got relatively young glacial soil.
###217 A lot of our soils were pushed in here by the glaciers,
###220 spread out on the landscape.
###221 So as these salts weather-- they're young materials;
###224 there's a lot of things to weather in there.
###228 They dissolve and go into the water.
###231 Then wherever the water goes, they carry these salt minerals.
###235 (Dr. Abdullah) Although it is a problem here,
###238 but it's no comparison
###239 to the salinity problem in other parts of the world.
###243 Just to give you an example-- California,
###245 the Joaquin Valley and the Salton Sea.
###248 The problems there are much bigger.
###250 The world is losing approximately
###253 a million hectares a year to salinity,
###257 and there are 200 million hectares of saline land
###261 which is not producing up to its productive capacity.
###265 There are issues in the Nile Delta
###268 especially after the construction of the Aswan Dam.
###271 After the construction of the dam,
###273 this kind of natural remedy, so to speak,
###277 of soil fertility and handling salinity stopped abruptly.
###284 Based on that, in fact, major health problems were created.
###291 (narrator) In our region, the topography of the land
###294 has lent itself to salinity problems,
###296 forcing many farmers to move this land
###299 to the Conservation Reserve Program.
###300 When the glaciers came through here,
###302 they ground up to pure shale,
###304 and most of the salinity that is in our soil
###308 originated from the pure shale formation
###309 in Eastern North Dakota at least.
###312 We were just looking in our training yesterday
###314 at a soil survey that was completed
###316 in Stutsman County back in the '80's
###319 before the wet cycle really started.
###321 There was only, I think, about 10 acres
###323 of a whole quarter section that was mapped saline.
###326 I believe that there's no question
###328 but that some of the salinity that we're seeing
###331 and the degree and the nature of the salinity,
###335 it's a function of what we're doing with water.
###337 It's linked to the Red River Valley floods.
###339 It's linked to overland flow.
###341 So consequently what that means is,
###342 is that there's simply more water on the landscape.
###345 More water either runs off the landscape.
###348 More water resides within the landscape, and there's
###351 less water that is moved back up through evapotranspiration.
###354 
###356 It's roughly 10.8
###359 deciSiemens per meter.
###362 And in this type of sampling,
###365 it'll show less salts 'cause we have
###367 a higher concentration of water with this soil, but that would
###371 easily equate to 25 deciSiemens on the other methods,
###374 and that is restrictive to almost all plant growth.
###377 (narrator) Salinity can be invisible or visible.
###380 Either way, it is affecting the bottom line and livelihood
###383 of producers all over the Upper Great Plains.
###386 Joleen Hadrich with North Dakota State University
###389 has researched the economic impact of salinity.
###391 What we know is that their yield is going to decrease,
###395 and that, of course, is going to relate
###398 into lower revenues and a lower profit level.
###400 Slightly saline would result in about a 15% yield loss.
###404 The moderate would be 50% yield loss.
###407 When I applied the average crop prices
###410 that we're receiving right now in those yield decreases,
###414 it resulted in $150 million decrease in revenue.
###418 (Bill Schuh) I think it's first and foremost a crop problem
###422 and secondly an economic problem.
###423 The loss of crop yields from salinization of the soil
###427 is a very, very major economic loss for our state.
###431 (Joe Breker) I did a recent poll
###434 with our group, our corn growers group, and it was
###437 fairly common to have producers from all over the state
###442 that are in the corn growers that had from 10% to 15%
###447 of their farms severely impacted by salinity.
###451 In terms of an overall problem, we could say
###456 that the agricultural land in Canada,
###459 about 1/3 includes salt-affected soils.
###462 If I'm a producer, I will try to minimize that--
###466 any kind of problems that relate to salinity--
###470 primarily because my assessed lands,
###473 the assessments, will decrease
###475 if my lands are identified as salinized.
###479 When we get to an EC of about 8 which is moderately saline,
###484 we have at least 50% reduction in yields on wheat.
###488 You can have 75% yield loss on corn,
###491 and soybeans, you might as well forget it
###494 because we're down to maybe 10% or not even worth harvesting.
###497 Basically it's an osmotic problem.
###499 If you get too much salt on the outside,
###502 you have too much osmotic suction on the outside,
###504 it competes with the electrolyte in the plant,
###506 and the plant reaches a point
###509 where it can't imbibe water properly,
###511 and you start getting yield reductions.
###512 (narrator) Another fear is what has happened
###515 in other parts of the world.--
###517 health issues, food supply issues and water quality issues.
###519 We constantly review the best available science from EPA
###524 and their contractors that they work with--universities
###527 that develop the best toxicological information
###530 that's available to date, and we incorporate those.
###534 If it's something immediate, we do it right away
###538 in our water quality standard.
###540 (Bill Schuh) I don't think that on the basis
###544 of current EPA and CDC documents we can conclude
###547 that sulphate is particularly damaging to water quality.
###550 As far as drinking water quality is concerned,
###552 people drink water that have a lot of salts in them.
###555 There's a very wide range of qualities in the waters
###558 that people drink and are capable of drinking.
###560 Right here in this area of the field--this is one of
###563 the more obvious places that you'll see salt.
###566 The obvious effects of the salt is this white crusting.
###569 I see too many guys trying to manage their salinity.
###572 They put some into CRP, but they don't go far enough,
###576 and then that salinity just continues to move out,
###578 and then they're mad because they don't have an impact,
###582 and it's just making it worse and worse.
###584 (narrator) And as you'll see next, the solutions farmers come up with
###588 can mean the difference
###589 between lost revenue and successful yields.
###591 
###595 Good management practices for salinity would include
###599 definitely CRP, understanding that,
###601 the variable rate and site specific technologies
###603 is the biggest one that I'm involved with.
###606 (David Burkland) Actually in Grand Forks County here,
###608 the level of salinity is
###610 one of the higher levels in the Red River Valley
###613 so we've tried a lot of different things.
###615 We have put some land into CRP,
###617 but we've done other things too
###619 to try to overcome the saline conditions--just crop choice
###623 is a big factor, picking the right crops.
###625 Picking crops that are tolerant to saline conditions
###629 is real important.
###631 (Shawn Kasprick) On the precision ag side of things,
###634 we got different site-specific products
###635 and services that we can provide that will give the growers
###639 a handle on where their salinity is,
###641 what impact it has on their crop, and how far out
###644 that impact really is effecting their crop.
###646 That all will wrap up eventually
###648 into a variable rate application for fertility
###651 and eventually the grower's bottom line.
###653 (Joe Michels) It takes a little while to get established.
###658 It did the job for me.
###661 We have had salinity issues.
###663 There's one hayfield we got from a fella that got sick.
###669 He told the landlord that he
###671 wanted to rent it to my dad
###674 back in the early 70's.
###676 We took it over; the ground was white.
###680 It would grow foxtail, kochia, and not too good at that.
###686 Then the garrison seemed to help.
###688 It took a long time to establish, but it is very thick.
###693 We got a good root structure
###695 where Dad could drive across there with a swather
###698 in the water and not get stuck.
###701 (Dr. Cihacek) Cover crops, especially deep-rooted cover crops,
###704 can have an effect on lowering the water table in an area.
###708 My favorite crop to lower water tables is alfalfa
###712 which is a perennial, permanent cover type crop.
###714 Alfalfa is very, very deep-rooted.
###716 (Hal Weiser) Out in Montana, they've really had a lot of success
###720 in addressing saline seeps
###722 and addressing how to correct those situations.
###724 One thing that's happened- there's been a shift
###727 in the western part of the state to no till
###729 so they've gotten a lot more efficient at water.
###732 A couple of years ago in 2008,
###734 we did a special initiative through the Equip Program
###737 which allowed us to provide cost share
###739 to producers that were having issues with salinity,
###742 and that was specifically on saline seeps.
###744 What they wanna see is which direction the groundwater
###747 is flowing when they start testing this,
###749 and then they wanna see the levels of the water.
###752 And as the water goes down, that means the salts are going down.
###756 The soil on the surface is more productive
###758 as the salts go lower into the soil profile.
###761 I can't honestly say what that piece of ground looked like before,
###764 but I was out on it last year on our crop tour,
###768 and like he said, you don't have the boggy areas out there.
###771 We drove across that with vehicles with a school bus.
###774 There's good ground cover, and it's actually very productive.
###777 (Joe Michels) We are able to seed everything.
###780 If you get something growing out there,
###783 use up the water, try to push the salts down.
###786 [motor purrs]
###790 (Paul Overby) So this is the obvious saline area
###794 where we've got the while soil,
###796 and nothing is growing except kochia.
###798 So we get back to almost the same spot every year
###801 so we've not skewing our results
###803 by testing one spot one year and then two years later
###806 coming back and doing something that's better.
###808 We're probing the same area.
###810 We've done that consistently now for four years.
###813 (Paul Overby) The reality is, the water tables all over
###817 the Devils Lake Basin are full to the point of discharging.
###820 We've had years in this area
###822 where I got stuck on the side of a hill.
###826 What we started doing was actually developing
###828 zone management for our fields.
###830 That idea intrigued me, of being able to apply
###832 the right amount of nutrient in the right parts of your field
###836 to match the crop yield potential.
###838 We actually use our experience then to tell the story
###841 as we go out and do seminars and meet with farmers.
###844 And a lot of farmers are a little surprised just like I was
###848 that the saline issue was much bigger than what they see.
###852 Almost every farmer says well, I turn my fertilizer off
###855 when I go through those white areas.
###857 I don't fertilize those areas; I know not to do that.
###860 But they don't realize how far away the saline issue really is.
###864 And so when we create maps for those farmers
###867 and then delineate that out, that makes sense to them.
###871 Then we started the business
###873 of making those maps for other people,
###875 training people how to use them,
###877 doing seminars for people and pointing this out.
###880 This is part of the management.
###882 I think the first solution is (1) recognizing the problem,
###885 and then (2) keeping after it.
###887 It isn't ever gonna go away.
###889 Water moves up and down in the fields.
###892 
###894 We've been doing some work on this probably going into
###899 our 3rd year now, and certainly when salinity is really high,
###904 then we get very low, almost no yield in potatoes.
###907 Especially since 2005, we had a lot of rain in our area here,
###911 I know just across the line they had some similar difficulties,
###915 definitely brought more saline to the surface, and since then
###918 we've had a little bit more
###921 quality problem with our potatoes.
###923 There's really nothing that physically,
###924 chemically I should say, removes salts.
###926 You're not gonna change the composition of that.
###929 You have to either physically either drain the salts away
###933 or put in a crop that can tolerate
###935 the elevated levels of salt in the soil.
###938 
###941 Late '90's, we chose to put
###943 a lot of our most severely saline land into CRP.
###948 That was a good option.
###949 I mean, that was an excellent option for us.
###952 So we put a lot of that land into CRP,
###956 and they used tall wheat grass, for example.
###959 We've always tried to keep crop rotations.
###962 Winter cereals are good because they will generally grow
###966 on saline ground better than row crop like corn or soybeans.
###971 But you have to grow what makes money,
###973 and not that winter wheat isn't good,
###976 but you can't raise winter wheat every year or you can't raise
###980 sunflowers every year so you have to raise a rotation,
###983 and some of those rotations aren't always very salt tolerant.
###986 
###990 (Rick Burgum) Well, the best way to reduce your salinity problem
###993 is to drain the surface water.
###995 Oftentimes you can't do that.
###997 The passive ways to do it are to grow something,
###1000 but you have this contradiction 'cause nothing grows.
###1003 The best thing to do is to grow your way out of it,
###1007 and we gotta find crops that will grow,
###1010 and then we've got to be able to practically grow them.
###1014 What we've doing on this plot is trying to show differences
###1017 in management, things that we can do to help assist
###1020 salt mobility and try to get crop production and growth.
###1023 With this research here, we're trying to show that tillage is
###1026 not an effective management tool for saline areas and salt areas,
###1029 specifically when they have a lot of sodium
###1032 but also when they have a lot of calcium.
###1034 In these plots, we did some tillage, we did some no till,
###1038 we also did some no till with straw cover to reduce evaporation.
###1041 I really have 3 basic treatments.
###1043 I have high evaporation,
###1045 what we would call a normal evaporation here
###1048 with our no till, and then also reduced evaporation.
###1051 And what the evaporation does is bring the salts to the surface.
###1054 So we're actually increasing the salts in the concentration
###1057 at the surface with the tillage and the no till.
###1060 The only treatments that are helping us to reduce it
###1063 a little bit is with the straw.
###1065 I think the drainage is a big thing
###1068 to get rid of the excess water first,
###1071 and that'll help probably pull away from--
###1073 it'll start to shrink some of these ponds,
###1076 and that way the salts will start disappearing on their own.
###1079 We've been in kind of a wet cycle
###1082 so that's probably part of the problem too.
###1084 From here to there the salinity was twice as much on this plot
###1088 as it was there, so within ten feet we had double the salinity.
###1091 Even though there's not a lot of topography change,
###1094 there's no soil type change, it's a water mobility thing.
###1097 
###1099 We have downward movement of water right here.
###1102 With the resource concerns
###1104 that we coming into our office,
###1105 we just really felt we needed to have some training
###1108 for our employees on how to handle salinity
###1111 and how to work with producers on salinity.
###1113 You know, the work that we're doing right now in North Dakota
###1117 on working with producers as NRCS
###1119 we are looking at trying to get into the rotation
###1123 more salt tolerant vegetation or trying to get cover crops
###1126 that are more salt tolerant of salinity--
###1128 to try to treat the saline areas,
###1131 but we're also looking at total landscape water use.
###1134 
###1140 (narrator) While growing salt tolerant crops like alfalfa
###1143 and barley or putting land into CRP are long standing ways
###1147 of dealing with and fighting salinity, a third solution is
###1151 more expensive and potentially more controversial.
###1154 It's the installation of subsurface drainage pipes
###1156 that are perforated so they're put at a depth
###1160 to reduce the drought water levels below a level
###1163 that'll allow the water to rise to the surface.
###1167 And what it does is, it drains excess water
###1169 that is not needed for crop production.
###1171 It doesn't affect the crop, the water that the crop needs,
###1175 but it drains excess water, and it allows
###1177 better aeration of soil which is also important for crop growth.
###1180 And with that, the salts move with the water.
###1182 So wherever the water goes is where the salts are going to go.
###1186 Other than that, there are other things
###1187 with sodium levels in the soil.
###1189 If you have high sodium levels,
###1191 the potential to leech out the calcium salts
###1193 will change the physical properties of the soil,
###1195 and it can actually accentuate
###1197 or make the soils less fit for crop production.
###1199 There is some danger with understanding essence
###1201 of tile drainage, knowing your soils is very, very important
###1206 before you install tile drainage,
###1208 and having an understanding of the history
###1211 and the potential for sodium-affected soils
###1214 after you start to drain that water out.
###1217 Tile drainage works. The advantage of tile drainage
###1219 is that it allows the farmer to regulate
###1221 when it gets in the field and when it gets out of the field.
###1226 If there's a large rain, the land manager can
###1228 pretty much guarantee that within 3 to 5 days, you're
###1231 going to be able to get into that field with tile drainage.
###1234 Without tile drainage it might be 7 to 12 days.
###1237 (narrator) Roxanne Johnson with North Dakota State University Extension
###1240 is in the midst of a 5-year study on salinity,
###1243 including the impact of tile drainage.
###1245 Where you put that outlet is really, really important.
###1249 Don't put it upstream of someone's home
###1252 so it's running by their house so they have
###1254 excess water sitting in from of their homes.
###1257 [chuckles] I'm a farm girl, so I'm afraid
###1259 that if we don't have tile drainage that there won't be
###1263 farming as we know it in eastern North Dakota
###1265 because of the high saline levels in these fields.
###1268 You talk to these producers,
###1270 and it's the best thing since white bread, apple pie!
###1275 (narrator) But other research from Joleen Hadrich
###1277 looked into the economics of tiling
###1280 which can cost farmers nearly $600 per acre to install.
###1283 I did my analysis assuming $4.75 per bushel of corn,
###1288 and now it's trading
###1290 at $7.00 a bushel on the futures market.
###1293 Drainage tile would make a lot more sense now,
###1296 but at $4.00 corn and a yield of 120 bushels per acre,
###1301 the farmer would be losing between $2.00 to $20.00 an acre
###1305 if they put in drainage tile.
###1307 It is expensive, but it took land
###1309 that was virtually worthless
###1311 for annual crop production
###1313 and made it good to excellent crop production land.
###1316 Tile drainage, what we are doing here
###1319 in the Red River Basin is
###1321 installing drain tile to remove excess subsurface water.
###1324 There's really one reason why farmers are
###1328 installing drain tiles on their fields,
###1330 and it's for increasing crop production.
###1333 We've tiled fields that farmers tell me
###1335 are their saltiest fields, and in a few years,
###1338 probably 3 to 5 years,
###1340 they are yielding as good as their best fields.
###1343 You look back here,
###1345 and anytime you see a pump pumping water,
###1347 you know there's a perception
###1349 that you're making new water,
###1351 and that is untrue.
###1353 What we're doing is, we're
###1355 lowering the water table,
###1357 and we're creating a reservoir in our field.
###1360 We've done a variety of things.
###1362 We are drain tiling, trying to get rid of some of the salts
###1365 that naturally through the rain will percolate through the soil
###1368 and go out through the drain tile.
###1370 We've got an interesting project with the University of Manitoba.
###1373 There's a couple of Ph.D. students doing their thesis
###1377 on water movement and saline soils,
###1379 and we have got a replicated trial here
###1382 in the back of this farm of about 15 acres.
###1386 They will be trying to determine how the saline areas
###1392 are mitigated with drainage and irrigation.
###1395 (Dr. Cihacek) Once you take that water and move it somewhere--
###1400 you gotta move it somewhere-- put it into a drainage ditch.
###1404 The problem with our flat landscape is,
###1406 it's hard to move it any long distance.
###1409 The water that comes out of the drains contain salts.
###1412 Now, my concern is with the drainage that you can have
###1416 a transfer of a problem from one field to another field
###1419 or another area because that water is going to contain salts.
###1422 If the water cannot flow off freely, it ponds up.
###1427 Then we've got the potential of salinizing other land.
###1432 Some of the preliminary numbers that I've reviewed
###1435 suggest that the total dissolved solids
###1438 in some of the tile drains are very, very high.
###1442 I've seen them 10,000, 15,000 milligrams per liter--
###1446 some very high sulphate numbers also.
###1448 Now, one or two individually
###1450 probably doesn't have a great effect.
###1453 What's unknown is the cumulative effect
###1455 of widespread tile drainage on the tributaries
###1457 flowing into the Red River and the Red River itself.
###1461 We do know that nitrate, for instance, seems to be
###1465 very, very high in tile drainage waters.
###1468 
###1472 Salinity is a global problem,
###1474 but the solutions to that should be and must be local.
###1479 (narrator) The causes of salinity are many,
###1481 as are the potential solutions.
###1483 The key for farmers and soil experts is
###1485 to curtail the problem before it reaches levels that have caused
###1489 economic collapse in other countries, in other times.
###1491 National, state and local solutions
###1493 will hopefully converge to win the battle.
###1496 Some of the crops as North Dakota shifting into
###1499 more of the corn belt types of production
###1501 with corn and soybeans.
###1503 We're going to see more problems emerge
###1505 with saline soils if we aren't careful.
###1508 (Dr. Hopkins) We have soils that are very, very productive,
###1511 but you can drive any road in North Dakota
###1515 and see examples of egregious erosion.
###1517 As government agencies, we need
###1519 to work with the growers--
###1521 corn growers, soybean growers and really try to address
###1524 this resource concern in North Dakota.
###1526 The universal advice which I would like to repeat is
###1531 instead of adapting the soil to the plant,
###1534 adapt the plant to the soil
###1537 as a biological long-term,
###1539 less expensive, and permanent solution.
