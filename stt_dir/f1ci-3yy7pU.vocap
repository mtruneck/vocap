###35 You want a piece of me ? Come get some.
###48 Heads up.
###56 Oh, shit !
###58 - Oh, hiya. - Don't sneak up on me like that !
###62 Ooohh ! Do you want a cup of tea ?
###64 Yes.
###95 - There's your tea. - Thank you.
###97 - You're up early. - I haven't been to bed.
###99 Me and Mike met up with two Scottish guys in the pub and they gave us cheap speed.
###103 <i>Oh, Tim, that's so tacky.</i>
###105 I know. They were so nice.
###107 If we'd have said no, they'd have got offended and beaten us to death with a pool cue.
###111 Where's Mike now ?
###119 Is there any post ?
###121 - I did hear droppage. - I'm gonna go and get my rejection letters.
###127 I met this really, really nice girl last night.
###130 Shh ! I'm supposed to be your girlfriend.
###133 - Marsha might hear. - Don't be daft !
###137 - You never know who's listening. - Nobody's listening.
###142 <i>- You never know who's listening, - Nobody's listening,</i>
###149 So who was this girl, then ?
###151 Her name was Cassandra, she was a psychic, she gave me her phone number.
###157 That's our phone number.
###160 Man, she's good.
###164 Rejection, rejection, rejection.
###167 <i>This is shit ! This is so shit !</i>
###172 I'm a good writer, you know ? All I want is a chance to prove it.
###176 Yeah ? Too much to ask ?
###178 Oh, I really miss my boyfriend.
###182 I'm gonna go to Hull to see Richard.
###185 Don't try and stop me, Tim. OK ? I really need this.
###189 <i>Oh ! It's from Flaps  !</i>
###193 - Who ? - The woman's magazine.
###195 I've got an interview today ! I'd better get ready.
###198 - What about Richard ? - Who ? Right, I'm gonna go to the shops.
###202 - Do you want anything ? - Porn !
###204 Tim, I'm not gonna buy you porn.
###206 You can get it from railway sidings like everybody else.
###209 I can't, I'm an adult. I'm supposed to leave it there.
###214 Oh, hi, Bri !
###220 Brought your mop back.
###227 What are you playing ?
###230 It's a subtle blend of lateral thinking and extreme violence.
###235 What, like It's A Knockout ?
###239 Did you want something ?
###242 No. Not really.
###246 Oh, there's a letter here for you. Came yesterday.
###250 It's open.
###252 Yeah. I opened it by accident because we've both got I's in our names.
###275 - It's from Vulva. - Is that another woman's magazine ?
###278 Vulva, it's an old friend. She's having a show tonight.
###281 You've got a friend called Vulva ? Who's called Vulva ?
###284 <i>- Her real name's lan. - What do you mean her real name's lan ?</i>
###287 - She's non-gender specific. - What, you mean he's a tranny ?
###290 - More than that. - What, a big, fat tranny ?
###293 Vulva. We had a multimedia performance-art partnership before she moved on.
###300 Such aesthetic wonders. Such vibrant times.
###305 Yeah, I can imagine.
###316 No. No, no. We did valuable work.
###326 <i>She was the beautiful one, really, I just danced to her tune,</i>
###331 It was purity.
###333 It was physical. Not in a sexual sense, no, we were collaborative.
###338 I don't expect you to understand. Most people don't want to hear, they just switch off.
###344 It's hard to hear the story of a love affair between two straight men,
###348 one of whom is the most divine woman alive.
###353 So, are you gonna go ?
###356 - I don't know, I haven't seen her for ages. - No, I meant are you gonna go now ?
###362 Oh, yeah.
###370 <i>Research, research, research, research, research, research, research,</i>
###379 <i>Clothes, clothes, ideas, clothes,,,</i>
###385 <i>Clothes, ideas, photographers,,, and,,, ooh !</i>
###402 Right.
###404 Current affairs, right. Ooh, current affairs.
###408 OK. What do you think about...
###410 What do you think about current affairs, Daisy ?
###414 What do I think about them ? Erm, well, I like them. I think they're good.
###418 Right. What shall I wear ?
###420 - I think you should dress like a lesbian. - How do lesbians dress ?
###424 Kind of like Suzi Quatro ?
###426 It's not really a lesbian magazine.
###428 It's more for modern, go-getting women with something to say, women like...
###432 - Suzi Quatro ? - No ! Like me.
###435 I'm not sure if I should go casual or strappy. Reliable and frumpy or stupid and glamorous.
###440 Why don't you go something in-between ?
###442 - Frumpy and stupid. - Save you getting ready.
###444 - Tim, I'm serious ! This is important, I've... - Look ! Daisy...
###448 Daisy, Daisy, Daisy.
###453 It's gonna be OK.
###456 Now have a big toke on this South African drugs-reefer-style spliff doobie.
###460 I dunno. Might make me paranoid.
###465 Oh, all right.
###473 (Music from Psycho)
###481 You all right ?
###484 Yeah.
###501 I nearly didn't make it. I was followed most of the way here by a squirrel.
###505 Must have seen it six or seven times.
###507 Maybe it was six or seven different squirrels.
###514 - I like your shoes. - They're Patrick Cox's.
###517 Oh, right. Borrowed them. Yeah.
###520 Small feet for a bloke.
###522 Oh, give Josh a big kiss for me. See you Saturday. Daisy Steiner ?
###529 Hiya, Linda ! Be with you in a minute. Love the shoes. Patrick Cox's ?
###537 Maybe you should try buying your own shoes in future.
###553 Hello, Vulva.
###556 So... come.
###559 Hi.
###561 Erm...
###563 Hello ! Shit.
###570 Hello, Vulva.
###575 Yeah, hi, Vulva. Nice invitation.
###578 Mm ? ! Oh, yeah, yeah. Hi, Vulva.
###581 Vulva ! Hi ! How are you ? How... ?
###584 <i>How are you ? How are you ? How,,, are,,, you ?</i>
###588 Brian, painter. Damien... Damien... ?
###591 Damien Hirst, hi, it's Brian.
###593 Vulva, I'm talking to Damien.
###596 Is it water with the sheep in the box ?
###599 No, I paint. Lots of work with... paint.
###602 I do big... big... big...
###606 Fucking loser. Yeah, yeah, big loser.
###609 Brian, painter, loser.
###612 <i>Big, fucking,,, loser !</i>
###616 Just...
###619 Take a seat.
###625 Daisy, is it ?
###628 Ah. Like a little flower.
###630 Right, I'm Yolanda.
###633 This is Tracy, who is our stylist, and Catherine who is Head of Marketing,
###636 and you've already met Sarah, she's Administration.
###639 The position requires you to work closely with Michelle and Tara
###644 who are busy working on features for our first edition
###647 which we're aiming to get out by the end of the month.
###649 We've started our launch campaign, have you seen it ?
###654 - I'm sorry. - Have you seen the launch campaign ?
###658 Yes.
###660 Our magazine reflects the needs of today's women.
###663 We want it big, hard and we want it now.
###666 <i>I knew I should have bought Huge Fat Cocks,</i>
###669 We need to know whether you feel, as someone working for our magazine,
###672 you could honestly and intelligently reflect the needs of our demographic,...
###676 ..the 20-40-year-old-woman who doesn't say no,
###678 who sees her home interiors the same way she sees her life...
###688 ..spunk !
###690 We don't want you to pigeonhole yourself but would you call yourself a postfeminist ?
###694 Um...  ?
###695 Let me put it this way, do you drink pints or shots ?
###699 Well, I do drink a pint, I will drink a pint,
###703 but I've been known to drink a vodka and tonic, you know,
###707 at a wedding, or...
###710 Well,... thanks for coming.
###714 It's been really useful.
###720 Right, well...
###723 Girl power !
###729 Don't write me off, Vulva.
###731 I can be...
###733 conceptual.
###735 I'm sorry, Brian.
###739 - Please. - It's your work.
###741 Abstract expressionism is so mid-to-late '80s.
###766 'There's no reason for us to stay any longer than necessary.'
###769 'Let's split up, look for any survivors and get out of here.'
###779 Hey !
###784 - How did it go ? - Yeah, great. It went well, actually.
###787 - Anyone phone ? - Your boyfriend.
###790 - Anyone important ? - No.
###799 You know when you said it went well ?
###802 Well, when you said "well",
###805 - did you mean shite ? - Yes.
###809 I froze up. I just... made a tit of myself.
###813 How much of a tit ?
###817 I said... "girl power".
###821 Did you do this ?
###825 Yes.
###829 Well, I mean, you know, you might have impressed them.
###832 How ?
###835 - Tim ! - Yeah, I'm thinking.
###837 Oh, shit ! Shitting shit it !
###840 Oh, don't be so dramatic, you don't know for definite you haven't got it. They might phone.
###848 Well, pick it up, then !
###851 Hello ? Oh, hi, Mike. Yeah, he's here, I'll just get him. It's your boyfriend.
###856 He's not my boyfriend.
###859 - Hi, babe.
###861 - Hello, Timmy. - 'Where are you ?'
###863 - Er, Sheffield. - What are you doing in Sheffield ?
###865 - Fell asleep on the tube. - The tube doesn't go to Sheffield.
###868 - Yeah, I must have changed at King's Cross. - Well, don't fall asleep on the way back, OK ?
###874 'Mike ?'
###876 Mike !
###881 What is it with you two ? You sound like his dad sometimes.
###885 Well, it's a long story.
###900 Hello ? Brian ?
###902 No, he's the weirdo downstairs.
###904 Oh ! Sorry, Brian ! Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come up. OK, bye.
###908 Brian's coming up.
###910 Why did he phone ?
###911 I don't know, why did he paint his arse blue last week ?
###915 - You don't like him, do you ? - I do, I just think he's a bit pretentious.
###919 How do I look ?
###921 - A bit pretentious ? - I think you look lovely, Brian.
###923 Do you think I should lose the waistcoat ?
###926 I think you should burn it, cos, you know, if you lose it, you might find it again.
###931 Are you going out, Bri ?
###933 <i>Yeah, he's gonna see his transsexual ex-boylgirlfriend's new play.</i>
###936 Oh, that sounds great ! Oh, we'll come ! You'll come, won't you, Tim ?
###941 - No way, it's not my cup of tea. - No, it isn't.
###943 Oh, come on, Bri, it'll be great, it'll be fun.
###946 You'll hate it. It's just a bit of art, load of wankers, influential people.
###950 - Free booze, though ! - Mm, yeah.
###952 OK, let's go to the theatre.
###955 You can come if you want but you probably won't get in.
###957 There's three of us, we've only got one invitation.
###960 That's OK. Go on, in you go. There's not that many here.
###963 - They haven't got tickets. - Look, mate, I've told you, you can go in.
###968 It's ridiculous, they haven't even been invited.
###970 Just leave it, Brian. Let's just go in, it'll be fine.
###974 We're not gonna embarrass you, we're here if you need us.
###977 OK. Sorry. Sorry.
###990 Hello !
###991 - Shit ! - Hi !
###993 - What you doin' here ? - Oh, we just came with Brian.
###996 Oh, how wonderful !
###998 - So how's it all goin' with the flat ? - It's fine.
###1002 Sorry, you come here for a big night out and there's your landlady spying on you.
###1009 Hello, Brian. Haven't seen you for a long while.
###1012 Been painting.
###1015 You've just been trying to avoid me, haven't ya ?
###1019 The show's starting.
###1042 - Hey ! - Sh !
###1047 Macro...
###1049 biotic !
###1052 Dust me clean !
###1054 A breath... alizer !
###1058 Using... a cleaning spray.
###1062 Knee...
###1064 - jerk ! - Suck it in !
###1066 Filter it out !
###1068 Go on !
###1076 Arrrhhhh...
###1080 <i>Beautiful, Beautiful,</i>
###1085 <i>I cannot believe I said "girl power",</i>
###1089 <i>Hey, deadhead ! Take a bite of peach,</i>
###1103 Hearing...
###1105 aidzz.
###1111 Fade...
###1114 out !
###1119 It's not finished !
###1123 It's finished.
###1138 - Do you mind if I put my glass there ? - It's a free country.
###1143 I thought... you were brilliant.
###1145 - And who are you, then ? - I'm Daisy Steiner, writer, sort of journalist.
###1150 Do you know any famous or important people ?
###1153 My mum's cousin went to school with Enya.
###1156 She was in the year above but they had the same percussion teacher.
###1160 I hate your mum and I hate you.
###1163 That's brilliant. Brilliant !
###1169 - Vulva, hi. - Brian ! You came !
###1173 - Wouldn't have missed it for the world. - Are you still painting ?
###1177 Not exclusively. I'm moving into multimedia pastures -
###1180 installations, a platter of organic processes mixed with a pinch of irony
###1185 and a side helping of self-deprecation.
###1188 Sounds delicious !
###1191 You should see what's for pudding.
###1205 Oh, Brian, you came.
###1208 No, I just spilt my drink.
###1209 So nice to see you. Are you still painting ?
###1213 N-not... er,... multimedia,...
###1216 platters,... irony and self-deprecation.
###1221 Sounds a little hard to swallow.
###1223 There's... there's pudding.
###1225 Pud-ding ! I always loved your quirkiness.
###1229 You must be able to see I've moved on.
###1232 The projects I've been working on with Hoover
###1235 are the most incisive and effective I've ever done.
###1238 I can't believe some of the shit I used to do with you.
###1242 That's the difference between you and me, Brian, I could always see into the distance,
###1246 you, it has to be said, were always a little short-sighted.
###1252 Anyway, we're having a postmortem at the Squid and Mashed Potato.
###1256 I suppose you could tag along.
###1260 You make your mind up and maybe I'll see you later.
###1267 (Music from Psycho)
###1274 Now, come on ! There's no need for us to be here any longer than necessary.
###1277 Let's split up, look for survivors and get out of here !
###1280 I'm writing a novel, poetry, articles, short stories, children's book.
###1285 - Ooh, and I'm doing a skydiving course. - Look, piss off, will ya ?
###1288 - Come on ! - What are you doing ?
###1290 - I'm saving us ! - This is Hoover.
###1294 Bye.
###1296 Bye, then.
###1299 I'll see you later.
###1309 - So beautiful. - Yeah.
###1313 Like a... kind of visual poetry.
###1317 - Wish I could do that. - Well, I'm sure you could if you had funding.
###1321 Right hook... bang.
###1324 - What ? - I should have done it long ago, Daisy ?
###1327 In his drunken, childish way, Tim saved me.
###1332 Talk about expression, talk about the truth,
###1337 but what truer expression is there than the purity of the clenched fist ?
###1343 I am a man, Daisy.
###1347 A man !
###1349 <i>Vulva treated me like a monkey !</i>
###1352 I'm more than that, I am a man !
###1355 A monkey-man !
###1357 A beast with a mind, and a mind, and fists !
###1361 And I will not be subdued again, not by Vulva, not by anyone !
###1368 Hey, fella !
###1383 Morning, slugger. Any letters ?
###1386 I don't know.
###1388 Agh !
###1393 - How do you feel ? - Oh, like I'm gonna die.
###1396 - Oh, me too. - So what happened last night ?
###1399 We went to see an interesting piece of contemporary theatre,
###1403 <i>we drank an enormous amount of free wine, we ate our body weight in Twiglets</i>
###1407 and you punched an artist in the face.
###1409 Shit.
###1411 - I'm not supposed to eat Twiglets. - Why not ?
###1413 They make me violent.
###1418 It's from the magazine.
###1420 Maybe they did like me. Maybe they liked my kookiness.
###1424 I could be like the cute one in the office, you know ?
###1426 The ditzy one who always gets it wrong, the office clown.
###1429 I'd be like "Ooh, Yolanda, I've lost the file."
###1432 She'd say "That's all right, Daisy, we just like having you around,
###1435 cos you're crazy and wild, an asset to the office dynamic."
###1440 - It's a no. - Oh, well, never mind.
###1442 Who needs them anyway, Daisy ? What do they know ? They're just jealous.
###1446 - Of what ? - Your tits ?
###1450 It's not about my tits any more, Tim. I wish it were.
###1454 It's not like the old days
###1455 when you could get a job wearing a short skirt and showing a bit of cleavage.
###1458 I've got to prove my intellectual worth.
###1461 I know there's something I've got to be, I just don't know what it is.
###1464 I feel like a rabbit...
###1468 trapped on a road to nowhere,
###1470 frozen in the headlights of the 21 st century.
###1473 Daisy, for the last time, will you stop being so dramatic ?
###1478 Why do you have to make such a performance out of everything ?
###1480 Yeah !
###1483 Rabbit, rabbit, rabbit, rabbit...
###1488 Rabbit, rabbit, rabbit, rabbit, rabbit, rabbit, rabbit, rabbit, rabbit, rabbit !
###1494 Ooh, like a little flower !
###1499 Thank you for coming, it's been very useful !
###1510 It's been very useful !
###1517 Rabbit, rabbit, rabbit, rabbit, rabbit !
###1520 Rabbit, rabbit, rabbit, rabbit !
###1522 It's not as easy as it looks, is it ?
###1525 Rabbit, rabbit, rabbit, rabbit, rabbit...
