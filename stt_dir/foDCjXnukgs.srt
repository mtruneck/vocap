1
0:0:0,11 --> 0:0:3,9
that there are many redundant forms of
communication


2
0:0:3,9 --> 0:0:6,509
and once communication is set up


3
0:0:6,509 --> 0:0:9,599
the survivors discovered the cold


4
0:0:9,599 --> 0:0:17,26
although resistance movement


5
0:0:17,26 --> 0:0:19,169
over your life


6
0:0:19,169 --> 0:0:27,659
but


7
0:0:27,659 --> 0:0:33,67
melbourne red-baiting hungry tattered
that steve crude from the surviving


8
0:0:33,67 --> 0:0:36,6
remnants of a devastated make sure it
for


9
0:0:36,6 --> 0:0:39,4
because the boulders bernhard is running


10
0:0:39,4 --> 0:0:42,86
what are your network heard about the
bull run


11
0:0:42,86 --> 0:0:46,75
you know i've heard landed at all began


12
0:0:46,75 --> 0:0:49,4
victory was very much in doubt


13
0:0:49,4 --> 0:0:51,93
again we are back


14
0:0:51,93 --> 0:0:54,46
there will be doable david


15
0:0:54,46 --> 0:0:59,24
but i have happily competent we will
have been


16
0:0:59,24 --> 0:1:0,23
survival


17
0:1:0,23 --> 0:1:5,39
is only a first step


18
0:1:5,39 --> 0:1:9,21
humanity must band together


19
0:1:9,21 --> 0:1:12,6
and fight


20
0:1:12,6 --> 0:1:25,59
there are


21
0:1:25,59 --> 0:1:34,51
deleon harvesters script


22
0:1:34,51 --> 0:1:36,75
but for perth survivors


23
0:1:36,75 --> 0:1:39,1
the terrifying harvest


24
0:1:39,1 --> 0:1:43,46
becomes an opportunity


25
0:1:43,46 --> 0:1:45,88
well the biggest problems with fighting


26
0:1:45,88 --> 0:1:49,5
would be getting inside the technology


27
0:1:49,5 --> 0:1:50,539
revolving


28
0:1:50,539 --> 0:1:52,57
orleans resting


29
0:1:52,57 --> 0:1:54,57
they've got the shield


30
0:1:54,57 --> 0:1:57,34
figure out a way to get insider shield


31
0:1:57,34 --> 0:2:1,42
in your life to have a lot more
effective damage


32
0:2:1,42 --> 0:2:3,65
but there's a simple


33
0:2:3,65 --> 0:2:8,539
using the aliens own technology


34
0:2:8,539 --> 0:2:11,699
the alien scripture


35
0:2:11,699 --> 0:2:36,769
becomes attract


36
0:2:36,769 --> 0:2:41,389
the


37
0:2:41,389 --> 0:2:44,749
caa


38
0:2:44,749 --> 0:2:51,729
there


39
0:2:51,729 --> 0:2:55,609
how


40
0:2:55,609 --> 0:2:58,619
how hot


41
0:2:58,619 --> 0:3:2,29
the human resistance has scored a
victory


42
0:3:2,29 --> 0:3:6,119
it's a small one but it brings hope


43
0:3:6,119 --> 0:3:9,469
three hours


44
0:3:9,469 --> 0:3:14,199
these military tactics are important
strategic part of the plan to fight


45
0:3:14,199 --> 0:3:17,37
indian innovation


46
0:3:17,37 --> 0:3:19,479
we're back again with your time


47
0:3:19,479 --> 0:3:23,619
grilling gate warfare before we have
faith


48
0:3:23,619 --> 0:3:27,689
risque computer gets t_v_ and high tech


49
0:3:27,689 --> 0:3:33,49
so survivors must fight them with www
tech


50
0:3:33,49 --> 0:3:37,249
the plan to resist the aliens is based
on history


51
0:3:37,249 --> 0:3:41,979
wars from the american revolution to the
iraq campaign


52
0:3:41,979 --> 0:3:44,78
tactics and small-scale explosives


53
0:3:44,78 --> 0:3:51,129
held leveled the playing field for a
technologically inferior fighting force


54
0:3:51,129 --> 0:3:53,819
lots of little blows into as much damage
is


55
0:3:53,819 --> 0:3:57,119
as one big word generally speaking


56
0:3:57,119 --> 0:4:4,99
lots and lots of little bloated much
more psychological damage


57
0:4:4,99 --> 0:4:9,109
military strategists have a name for
this approach


58
0:4:9,109 --> 0:4:11,599
a symmetric warfare


59
0:4:11,599 --> 0:4:14,799
i'm in a bit of a question of course war
default


60
0:4:14,799 --> 0:4:18,3
does this become more and more than
technology


61
0:4:18,3 --> 0:4:22,959
for those of the come a long drawn-out
the insurrection area campaign


62
0:4:22,959 --> 0:4:24,47
we can cut by him


63
0:4:24,47 --> 0:4:27,669
the same way in the same organization
that he's used to fighting


64
0:4:27,669 --> 0:4:30,3
he's probably got it features


65
0:4:30,3 --> 0:4:34,21
so even if i could orville disconnected
his soft spots his commander control no


66
0:4:34,21 --> 0:4:36,569
to this was just too close


67
0:4:36,569 --> 0:4:41,84
you've got a attack when it's not
expected


68
0:4:41,84 --> 0:4:46,1
today one of the greatest experts in a
symmetric warfare


69
0:4:46,1 --> 0:4:50,589
is also one of the largest defense
departments in the world


70
0:4:50,589 --> 0:4:53,49
the pentagon


71
0:4:53,49 --> 0:4:55,15
paperwork


72
0:4:55,15 --> 0:4:59,84
the hard way


73
0:4:59,84 --> 0:5:1,43
our military has had


74
0:5:1,43 --> 0:5:4,789
at this point by nine year


75
0:5:4,789 --> 0:5:6,3
hard core class


76
0:5:6,3 --> 0:5:8,12
on how to be insurgents


77
0:5:8,12 --> 0:5:12,489
they've been fighting for nine years


78
0:5:12,489 --> 0:5:13,729
in iraq


79
0:5:13,729 --> 0:5:16,479
and afghanistan


80
0:5:16,479 --> 0:5:21,24
america's overwhelming firepower can
sometimes to feed it with a simple


81
0:5:21,24 --> 0:5:24,9
roadside bombs


82
0:5:24,9 --> 0:5:26,3
to low-tech mein type of weapon


83
0:5:26,3 --> 0:5:29,879
but it causes concern among state
technological poor status can't find


84
0:5:29,879 --> 0:5:32,199
officially casual user occurring


85
0:5:32,199 --> 0:5:35,65
furor when it's going to happen where
it's going to happen


86
0:5:35,65 --> 0:5:43,819
so it has a wearing down effect on me up
early portions


87
0:5:43,819 --> 0:5:50,509
the insurgents also change their tactics
regularly any new idea is always good


88
0:5:50,509 --> 0:5:52,18
as the first time we use it


89
0:5:52,18 --> 0:5:55,81
they got a barrage explosive devices
when they first argues nose and mouth


90
0:5:55,81 --> 0:5:57,949
the iraqi a war


91
0:5:57,949 --> 0:6:0,499
they used the doorbell buzzers


92
0:6:0,499 --> 0:6:3,999
cellphone ringers and we would figure
out how they were doing that they would


93
0:6:3,999 --> 0:6:6,31
switch to something else


94
0:6:6,31 --> 0:6:11,999
they would use radio communications than
they would switch to something else


95
0:6:11,999 --> 0:6:14,509
the strategies are effective


96
0:6:14,509 --> 0:6:16,199
into thousand eight


97
0:6:16,199 --> 0:6:22,969
seventy percent of american deaths were
from improvised explosive devices


98
0:6:22,969 --> 0:6:27,529
one method the pentagon users to create
contra strategies to such a deadly


99
0:6:27,529 --> 0:6:28,729
attacks


100
0:6:28,729 --> 0:6:31,819
decision team


101
0:6:31,819 --> 0:6:35,37
a war game


102
0:6:35,37 --> 0:6:40,4
america's military finance its tactics
based on computer simulations and


103
0:6:40,4 --> 0:6:42,9
teachers wargames


104
0:6:42,9 --> 0:6:46,809
these are often highly classified
projects using some of the most powerful


105
0:6:46,809 --> 0:6:50,499
computers in the world


106
0:6:50,499 --> 0:6:51,699
these computers sooner


107
0:6:51,699 --> 0:6:58,78
resource helped establish america
strategies protocol around the world


108
0:6:58,78 --> 0:7:2,9
when travis steelers computer simulation
is running for interviewing an invasion


109
0:7:2,9 --> 0:7:4,759
boarding scenario


110
0:7:4,759 --> 0:7:6,889
the warranty short


111
0:7:6,889 --> 0:7:9,69
bikini and swim


112
0:7:9,69 --> 0:7:10,509
everytime


113
0:7:10,509 --> 0:7:13,429
sometimes within an hour


114
0:7:13,429 --> 0:7:19,389
but when the time frame of the war game
is extended from deeds to here's


115
0:7:19,389 --> 0:7:22,699
the results change


116
0:7:22,699 --> 0:7:24,639
in the long run


117
0:7:24,639 --> 0:7:26,93
is all about it you can kill them faster


118
0:7:26,93 --> 0:7:29,569
then they can replace their troops


119
0:7:29,569 --> 0:7:34,579
then you can chip away at that spellman
whittle that down


120
0:7:34,579 --> 0:7:39,319
i mean you can overwhelm


121
0:7:39,319 --> 0:7:52,399
these wargames form the basis of the
plan for a indian resistance


122
0:7:52,399 --> 0:7:57,479
it's a simple rule of guru warfare


123
0:7:57,479 --> 0:8:6,499
small attacks on a constant pieces keeps
the war going on


124
0:8:6,499 --> 0:8:10,999
six months of observation has also
uncovered a critical characteristic of


125
0:8:10,999 --> 0:8:14,46
the invaders


126
0:8:14,46 --> 0:8:21,199
their numbers aren't increasing


127
0:8:21,199 --> 0:8:23,689
forces had mentioned true far from


128
0:8:23,689 --> 0:8:26,119
to rely on reinforcements


129
0:8:26,119 --> 0:8:28,939
that means every lost unit


130
0:8:28,939 --> 0:8:30,999
be replaced


131
0:8:30,999 --> 0:8:33,14
and that's a pretty ron


132
0:8:33,14 --> 0:8:40,3
the computer simulation now favors


133
0:8:40,3 --> 0:8:44,18
the winner of a war is what is the
largest population in and could be


134
0:8:44,18 --> 0:8:45,58
aliens


135
0:8:45,58 --> 0:8:49,97
here are two years ago we used to be a
more aliens here too but the mother


136
0:8:49,97 --> 0:8:51,77
we might end up


137
0:8:51,77 --> 0:8:53,96
in a numbers game


138
0:8:53,96 --> 0:8:56,48
thrust


139
0:8:56,48 --> 0:9:0,88
students can take lessons on survival
from the most populous creatures on


140
0:9:0,88 --> 0:9:3,54
earth


141
0:9:3,54 --> 0:9:5,84
pants


142
0:9:5,84 --> 0:9:7,309
and societies


143
0:9:7,309 --> 0:9:11,759
and those of other social insects are
decentralize there's no central leader


144
0:9:11,759 --> 0:9:16,98
or police worth the rules get sent out
and uh... this is a real smart way of


145
0:9:16,98 --> 0:9:20,6
organizing society's it's very hard to
fight


146
0:9:20,6 --> 0:9:24,68
not hard for full systems like annette
calling so you can kill all the and she


147
0:9:24,68 --> 0:9:26,17
want in your kitchen


148
0:9:26,17 --> 0:9:32,29
and it's probably not going to matter to
the caller ip all


149
0:9:32,29 --> 0:9:35,84
banding together helps keep the
individual lives


150
0:9:35,84 --> 0:9:38,75
and keeping the groups small in separate


151
0:9:38,75 --> 0:9:42,57
helps make the human species less
vulnerable to extinction than it is


152
0:9:42,57 --> 0:9:44,82
obvious that yes


153
0:9:44,82 --> 0:9:47,28
the goal is not too and i believe


154
0:9:47,28 --> 0:9:51,81
powerful invader it's to make him want
to leave


155
0:9:51,81 --> 0:9:56,25
or really have to is figure out a way to
hold out much longer


156
0:9:56,25 --> 0:9:57,19
hopefully


157
0:9:57,19 --> 0:9:59,15
bills that have been too busy part of
this day


158
0:9:59,15 --> 0:10:2,61
billowed up their bags please


159
0:10:2,61 --> 0:10:7,63
the strategy always to bring the battle
to the enemy


160
0:10:7,63 --> 0:10:10,2
no weapon is off limits


161
0:10:10,2 --> 0:10:11,85
including what may be good


162
0:10:11,85 --> 0:10:17,3
deadliest of what's left in the arsenal


163
0:10:17,3 --> 0:10:31,91
the human body


164
0:10:31,91 --> 0:10:36,8
time may be running short for grad
school armies


165
0:10:36,8 --> 0:10:45,96
and the entire planet


166
0:10:45,96 --> 0:10:49,67
the alien newcomers are what biologists
call


167
0:10:49,67 --> 0:10:53,92
invasive species


168
0:10:53,92 --> 0:10:58,57
than invasive species as one that moves
into an area that's never previously


169
0:10:58,57 --> 0:11:0,32
occupied


170
0:11:0,32 --> 0:11:4,1
and disrupts the local ecology


171
0:11:4,1 --> 0:11:6,51
as successful invasive species is


172
0:11:6,51 --> 0:11:8,28
could it moving around


173
0:11:8,28 --> 0:11:12,78
and disrupting the landscape usually
through aggressive behavior


174
0:11:12,78 --> 0:11:17,83
which can be there for fighting or just
domination of space


175
0:11:17,83 --> 0:11:18,66
once


176
0:11:18,66 --> 0:11:25,56
the suspension system


177
0:11:25,56 --> 0:11:27,93
case in point


178
0:11:27,93 --> 0:11:31,35
fire ants in the american south


179
0:11:31,35 --> 0:11:36,1
these stealing resume in the past first
came to america on a single cargo ship


180
0:11:36,1 --> 0:11:38,5
in nineteen thirty


181
0:11:38,5 --> 0:11:40,2
they began to spread


182
0:11:40,2 --> 0:11:43,88
conquering every other camps species in
their path


183
0:11:43,88 --> 0:11:46,18
these amps actually kill off


184
0:11:46,18 --> 0:11:51,16
every other empathic and scattered
reload mandible salon


185
0:11:51,16 --> 0:11:54,39
invasive and sweep over the landscape
producer away and there's no evidence


186
0:11:54,39 --> 0:11:58,9
that they back off


187
0:11:58,9 --> 0:11:59,0
today


188
0:11:59,0 --> 0:12:3,61
fire ants are found from maryland to
california


189
0:12:3,61 --> 0:12:11,14
history does change forever once
abrasive species comes up


190
0:12:11,14 --> 0:12:12,1
now


191
0:12:12,1 --> 0:12:17,14
the bands of human guerrillas hope to
drive off the invasive aliens


192
0:12:17,14 --> 0:12:24,63
before they transform the environment of
our planet to their poll meets


193
0:12:24,63 --> 0:12:27,38
one way to fight an invasive species


194
0:12:27,38 --> 0:12:31,7
is to create more of the local species


195
0:12:31,7 --> 0:12:37,68
the war against the in the invasion will
mean


196
0:12:37,68 --> 0:12:41,84
if we're gonna create a long-term
resistance were up to change our talked


197
0:12:41,84 --> 0:12:45,42
about what's except born culture and
society


198
0:12:45,42 --> 0:12:50,21
if there's a female bits of birthing a
change in these big break with his meany


199
0:12:50,21 --> 0:12:52,32
children as you possibly can


200
0:12:52,32 --> 0:12:56,93
so there might be fertility drugs in
houston


201
0:12:56,93 --> 0:13:2,2
a breeding program will require multiple
makes


202
0:13:2,2 --> 0:13:3,1
more children


203
0:13:3,1 --> 0:13:6,1
will require multiple pregnancies


204
0:13:6,1 --> 0:13:8,58
anyone not pregnant


205
0:13:8,58 --> 0:13:10,89
becomes a warrior


206
0:13:10,89 --> 0:13:14,38
mail or female


207
0:13:14,38 --> 0:13:18,17
human being that's at the age of say
fourteen or older would need to be


208
0:13:18,17 --> 0:13:19,79
carrying a weapon


209
0:13:19,79 --> 0:13:21,23
we have to create a


210
0:13:21,23 --> 0:13:23,98
total resistance


211
0:13:23,98 --> 0:13:26,91
every human being that's a lot


212
0:13:26,91 --> 0:13:30,5
