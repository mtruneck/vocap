1
0:0:5,305 --> 0:0:9,71
Animals do not grow
smarter and wiser.


2
0:0:9,71 --> 0:0:15,319
Animals that are born with lack of
vision die out in a visual field.


3
0:0:15,319 --> 0:0:21,28
Nature kills 10,000 animals
for each one it produces.


4
0:0:21,28 --> 0:0:23,154
I better do that with a worm.


5
0:0:23,154 --> 0:0:27,362
If you could spread this
idea into all areas:


6
0:0:27,362 --> 0:0:30,986
Worms are born...


7
0:0:30,986 --> 0:0:34,302
This is a drawing of a worm.


8
0:0:34,302 --> 0:0:38,614
A worm has light cells
all over its body.


9
0:0:38,614 --> 0:0:44,251
They're very weak, their eyes,
but the early stages of the eye.


10
0:0:44,251 --> 0:0:49,62
When this worm sticks its
front end out of the ground


11
0:0:49,62 --> 0:0:52,246
and a bird sees it,
it picks it off.


12
0:0:52,246 --> 0:0:56,79
If it's born with more light
cells up here, just a few more


13
0:0:56,79 --> 0:1:2,17
then if the bird's shadow comes, it retracts.
- Gotcha.


14
0:1:2,17 --> 0:1:8,46
Then eventually all the worms that
survive have light cells over here.


15
0:1:8,46 --> 0:1:11,404
The eye is an organization
of light cells.


16
0:1:11,404 --> 0:1:16,876
It starts out with light cells all
over, but the worms that survive


17
0:1:16,876 --> 0:1:19,837
are the worms with the light
cells at the leading edge.


18
0:1:19,837 --> 0:1:23,934
If they're at the trailing
edge, it doesn't survive.


19
0:1:23,934 --> 0:1:28,97
When a bird lands with a worm, and
the other birds open their mouths


20
0:1:28,97 --> 0:1:32,196
(I did this years ago)


21
0:1:32,196 --> 0:1:36,921
the bird that moves the most with
its mouth open gets all the worms.


22
0:1:36,921 --> 0:1:41,814
- Gotcha. - It doesn't feed all the birds.
- It feeds the most active.


23
0:1:41,814 --> 0:1:45,177
- I made a plastic bird
with its mouth wide open


24
0:1:45,177 --> 0:1:49,743
on a spring that moved more, and the
bird put all the worms in there.


25
0:1:49,743 --> 0:1:52,829
That's when I
became a mechanist.


26
0:1:52,829 --> 0:1:56,32
I believe that human beings
cannot think or reason


27
0:1:56,32 --> 0:1:59,956
they're mechanisms that
respond to the environment


28
0:1:59,956 --> 0:2:4,858
because they have a wide
range of responding sensors.


29
0:2:4,858 --> 0:2:9,927
I looked at robots the same
way, but we're organic.


30
0:2:9,927 --> 0:2:13,373
We get hungry, so we hunt.
Robots don't.


31
0:2:13,373 --> 0:2:16,71
Robots don't say "I
need lubrication


32
0:2:16,71 --> 0:2:18,62
so I'm going to behave
a certain way."


33
0:2:18,62 --> 0:2:21,847
They don't care whether you
lubricate them or not.


34
0:2:21,847 --> 0:2:24,341
They don't evolve.


35
0:2:24,341 --> 0:2:29,473
No man has been able to make a
robot that says "Just a minute.


36
0:2:29,473 --> 0:2:34,717
I feel good doing that.
" Robots don't feel good or bad.


37
0:2:34,717 --> 0:2:38,437
I don't know if you've noticed this:
when a wolf has incisors (larger)


38
0:2:38,437 --> 0:2:41,527
he could tear off
bigger pieces of meat.


39
0:2:41,527 --> 0:2:46,342
If he swallows it faster, he
could survive starvation.


40
0:2:46,342 --> 0:2:50,552
Animals do not chew their food.
They rip off the meat and swallow it


41
0:2:50,552 --> 0:2:53,859
whole, just as it is.
I don't know if you've noticed that.


42
0:2:53,859 --> 0:2:56,811
That animal will
survive in scarcity.


43
0:2:56,811 --> 0:3:1,919
The animal that tears the meat off and
chews on it won't have enough food.


44
0:3:1,919 --> 0:3:5,32
The animals tear it apart, fast


45
0:3:5,32 --> 0:3:8,608
and they don't outgrow that.


46
0:3:8,608 --> 0:3:11,452
The animals born with
larger fangs survive


47
0:3:11,452 --> 0:3:15,363
those with shorter fangs don't
get a bigger piece of the meat.


48
0:3:15,363 --> 0:3:18,669
Animal life has no purpose
is what I'm trying to say.


49
0:3:18,669 --> 0:3:22,535
There's no purpose to eyes,
ears, teeth or anything.


50
0:3:22,535 --> 0:3:27,695
If you're born with things that work
under those conditions, you survive.


51
0:3:27,695 --> 0:3:32,325
If you're born with a
more rational mind


52
0:3:32,325 --> 0:3:35,844
and you're rational about
everything, you can't live.


53
0:3:35,844 --> 0:3:38,939
You might leave a little
food for your young.


54
0:3:38,939 --> 0:3:42,193
If a bird doesn't feed its young


55
0:3:42,193 --> 0:3:46,784
(let's say it just eats the
food) that species is gone:


56
0:3:46,784 --> 0:3:49,234
a bird that doesn't
take care of its young.


57
0:3:49,234 --> 0:3:52,39
Birds are not born to
take care of their young.


58
0:3:52,39 --> 0:3:55,226
They say "They instinctively
take care of their young."


59
0:3:55,226 --> 0:4:0,309
The birds that don't feed their
young are dead. They're gone.


60
0:4:0,309 --> 0:4:2,861
If you start looking
for purpose in life


61
0:4:2,861 --> 0:4:5,4
everything seems
to have a purpose.


62
0:4:5,4 --> 0:4:8,502
Questioner: So you're looking at the
successful birds that still exist.


63
0:4:8,502 --> 0:4:10,645
- Under those conditions.
- Yes, under those conditions


64
0:4:10,645 --> 0:4:13,952
that feed their young.
That's why they're there...


65
0:4:13,952 --> 0:4:17,779
(Jacque)
- Yes, same with humans.


66
0:4:17,779 --> 0:4:21,126
You feed their young because
they're not helpless.


67
0:4:21,126 --> 0:4:24,729
Chinese used to drown
babies that were female.


68
0:4:24,729 --> 0:4:26,697
Did you know that?


69
0:4:26,697 --> 0:4:28,871
Because they can't feed them.


70
0:4:28,871 --> 0:4:32,428
An Eskimo would put his
grandma out on the ice


71
0:4:32,428 --> 0:4:35,254
when there is a
shortage of seals.


72
0:4:35,254 --> 0:4:37,687
She never wanted to
be put out on the ice


73
0:4:37,687 --> 0:4:40,233
so she'd always
behave very well.


74
0:4:40,233 --> 0:4:43,389
It took an Eskimo who had
a wonderful grandmother


75
0:4:43,389 --> 0:4:47,3
a little longer to put
her out on the ice.


76
0:4:47,3 --> 0:4:51,4
That's very hard to accept
that humans are machines.


77
0:4:51,4 --> 0:4:53,857
They're responding organisms.


78
0:4:53,857 --> 0:4:55,854
Very difficult.


79
0:4:55,854 --> 0:5:0,29
People that used to attend
my seminars for years


80
0:5:0,29 --> 0:5:3,489
would write songs about
'I'm a responding organism


81
0:5:3,489 --> 0:5:5,592
a bundle of tropisms.'


82
0:5:5,592 --> 0:5:9,251
You know, and they couldn't
get along with normal people.


83
0:5:9,251 --> 0:5:11,231
You must understand that.


84
0:5:11,231 --> 0:5:15,355
A guy said "I've been attending your sessions.
I'm losing my friends!"


85
0:5:15,355 --> 0:5:17,594
I said "You're not
losing your friends


86
0:5:17,594 --> 0:5:23,112
you're losing people that
are hardheaded, hardwired."


87
0:5:23,112 --> 0:5:30,236
You'll have to change people
to get along with them.


88
0:5:30,236 --> 0:5:33,202
I call it poisoning the well.


89
0:5:33,202 --> 0:5:38,255
I'm saying that all things are shoved
by something else. There's nothing...


90
0:5:38,255 --> 0:5:42,787
Although we can't see the wire
up our ass connected to the sun


91
0:5:42,787 --> 0:5:46,984
we depend on the sun, the
radiant energy of the sun.


92
0:5:46,984 --> 0:5:50,116
You may not see the
forces that move you:


93
0:5:50,116 --> 0:5:55,547
nutrition, different food combinations
strengthen your fingernails


94
0:5:55,547 --> 0:5:58,764
lack of it makes them
soft and they crack.


95
0:5:58,764 --> 0:6:3,614
You don't know how your body
operates, but if you study nutrition


96
0:6:3,614 --> 0:6:7,463
and physical degeneration, you
know more about the body.


97
0:6:7,463 --> 0:6:13,13
You never know everything.
The word 'everything' is a stupid word.


98
0:6:13,13 --> 0:6:17,602
It implies that there is
such a thing as everything.


99
0:6:17,602 --> 0:6:22,461
When you get into the mechanistic point
of view, all that the mechanist says


100
0:6:22,461 --> 0:6:26,194
is that all things are
shoved by other things.


101
0:6:26,194 --> 0:6:29,192
There is no prime source
of that movement.


102
0:6:29,192 --> 0:6:34,634
In other words, if this begins to roll,
it means the table is not level.


103
0:6:34,634 --> 0:6:39,93
Nothing moves of itself.
Plants do not grow.


104
0:6:39,93 --> 0:6:43,648
They depend on sunlight, water,
moisture, soil, temperature


105
0:6:43,648 --> 0:6:48,361
many different things.
There's no prime mover.


106
0:6:48,361 --> 0:6:50,751
They say "How did the
universe begin?"


107
0:6:50,751 --> 0:6:54,943
That's a stupid question.
It assumes a beginning.


108
0:6:54,943 --> 0:6:58,193
A seed they say is the
beginning of a plant.


109
0:6:58,193 --> 0:7:0,59
How do you know it's
not the end product?


110
0:7:0,59 --> 0:7:3,569
Why do you call
it the beginning?


111
0:7:3,569 --> 0:7:7,96
Do you understand what I am saying?
Man projects like hell


112
0:7:7,96 --> 0:7:9,308
including scientists.


113
0:7:9,308 --> 0:7:13,126
There's no good, no bad, no
smart people, no dumb people.


114
0:7:13,126 --> 0:7:16,954
There are people that have
less tools than you do.


115
0:7:16,954 --> 0:7:19,555
You might have better tools.


116
0:7:19,555 --> 0:7:23,95
If a girl falls in love
with a taller guy than you


117
0:7:23,95 --> 0:7:26,754
because she likes tall people,
and you get mad at her


118
0:7:26,754 --> 0:7:29,925
you don't understand the
effects of environment.


119
0:7:29,925 --> 0:7:34,15
When you understand you'll never
dislike anybody or hate them.


120
0:7:34,15 --> 0:7:36,85
You'll understand where
they're coming from


121
0:7:36,85 --> 0:7:40,55
and that will stop a lot
of crime and a lot of...


122
0:7:40,55 --> 0:7:43,392
That's what I mean by
we're not educated.


123
0:7:43,392 --> 0:7:47,948
I hope you know what I mean
now, we're not given a...


124
0:7:47,948 --> 0:7:51,41
"Well I've never heard of
Fresco, he has no Ph.D.


125
0:7:51,41 --> 0:7:56,639
He never graduated junior grade school.
Therefore, fuck Fresco.


126
0:7:56,639 --> 0:8:1,449
You're a follower of
some fraudulent guy."


127
0:8:1,449 --> 0:8:5,469
That's what they'll tell you
if you talk to normal people


128
0:8:5,469 --> 0:8:7,659
but if you understand
what I'm saying


129
0:8:7,659 --> 0:8:11,697
you'll only understand those
things that have parallel


130
0:8:11,697 --> 0:8:14,965
that you have experience with.


131
0:8:14,965 --> 0:8:22,245
I can't talk to anybody.
They would hate me.


132
0:8:22,245 --> 0:8:25,109
If I talk to
scientists, they'd say


133
0:8:25,109 --> 0:8:28,466
"Well where the hell do
you get your ideas from?


134
0:8:28,466 --> 0:8:31,415
You know I got mine
by hard work."


135
0:8:31,415 --> 0:8:35,553
So did I.
To get it, I worked very hard


136
0:8:35,553 --> 0:8:38,309
questioning everything,
trying to.


137
0:8:38,309 --> 0:8:41,59
I still have a few carry-overs


138
0:8:41,59 --> 0:8:43,421
which I'm okay with.


139
0:8:43,421 --> 0:8:45,464
- Primordial slime.  - What?


140
0:8:45,464 --> 0:8:50,1
- Primordial slime.
- Yes, primordial slime, exactly.


141
0:8:50,1 --> 0:8:52,206
That goes for all of us.


142
0:8:52,206 --> 0:8:55,953
We could never be objective.
Do you know why?


143
0:8:55,953 --> 0:9:2,349
We can never be open-minded, because
all of us have some of the slime.


144
0:9:2,349 --> 0:9:6,348
There are some of us that can
accept a wider range of behavior


145
0:9:6,348 --> 0:9:9,696
due to background.
If you don't have this background


146
0:9:9,696 --> 0:9:14,4
if you've never been here, you'll
retain what you've been given


147
0:9:14,4 --> 0:9:18,42
but from now on, you're poisoned.
You can't go back


148
0:9:18,42 --> 0:9:22,533
to the old way of thinking.
You'll never be able to go back.


149
0:9:22,533 --> 0:9:25,318
There are no roads to yesterday.


150
0:9:25,318 --> 0:9:30,394
Do you know what I mean by that?
We can't go backwards and say "Well


151
0:9:30,394 --> 0:9:33,789
I've become an atheist.
Now I'm going to become a Catholic again"


152
0:9:33,789 --> 0:9:37,997
unless you see
things differently.


153
0:9:37,997 --> 0:9:42,659
Believe in miracles, and you believe
in people with power of telekinesis.


154
0:9:42,659 --> 0:9:47,65
If you don't know how they do that,
you might go back to church.


155
0:9:47,65 --> 0:9:49,346
Questioner: Were you
once Christian?


156
0:9:49,346 --> 0:9:54,729
Jacque: Yes, I was once a believer in God.
Let's say that.


157
0:9:54,729 --> 0:9:58,462
I believed that somebody made the world
because that's what they told me.


158
0:9:58,462 --> 0:10:0,846
Questioner: What made
you change your mind?


159
0:10:0,846 --> 0:10:4,888
Jacque: A motion picture
called 'The Ten Commandments.'


160
0:10:4,888 --> 0:10:7,624
Ever hear of it? Cecil B. Demille.
- Yeah, I saw that.


161
0:10:7,624 --> 0:10:9,995
Jacque: The old one,
the original.


162
0:10:9,995 --> 0:10:14,676
I came home and said to my older brother
"I don't understand the Egyptians.


163
0:10:14,676 --> 0:10:17,582
Didn't they believe in the
same God we believe in?"


164
0:10:17,582 --> 0:10:20,208
He said "No, maybe
they were atheists."


165
0:10:20,208 --> 0:10:24,19
My brother was a little older,
and I asked "What's an atheist?"


166
0:10:24,19 --> 0:10:27,391
"Well atheists believe
that animals evolved.


167
0:10:27,391 --> 0:10:31,155
The giraffes, they ate things,
and made a longer neck


168
0:10:31,155 --> 0:10:33,918
and animals went
through evolution."


169
0:10:33,918 --> 0:10:36,525
He knew a little bit
about evolution


170
0:10:36,525 --> 0:10:41,931
and from my background at that
time, that made more sense.


171
0:10:41,931 --> 0:10:46,195
If I had another background, I'd have
said "Gee, maybe there isn't a God."


172
0:10:46,195 --> 0:10:49,413
I began to talk to people.
They said "You're nuts!


173
0:10:49,413 --> 0:10:51,549
There's got to be a God."


174
0:10:51,549 --> 0:10:55,5
Then I read books on
atheism, a little bit


175
0:10:55,5 --> 0:11:1,204
and it made more sense than God
making a man and a woman out of clay


176
0:11:1,204 --> 0:11:5,331
earth, and he turned them
loose in the Garden of Eden.


177
0:11:5,331 --> 0:11:7,942
That sounded more
like a fairy tale.


178
0:11:7,942 --> 0:11:11,192
I had enough of a
background to make it.


179
0:11:11,192 --> 0:11:14,662
If I didn't, I would
have rejected it.


180
0:11:14,662 --> 0:11:18,522
When the minister said "It
rains to make the plants grow"


181
0:11:18,522 --> 0:11:20,752
I said "Why does
it rain at sea?"


182
0:11:20,752 --> 0:11:24,296
I really wanted to know.
I was not an atheist.


183
0:11:24,296 --> 0:11:26,909
He said hold out your
hands and he beat me


184
0:11:26,909 --> 0:11:31,913
and I began to doubt the
wisdom of that guy.


185
0:11:31,913 --> 0:11:35,46
Then he said "God works
in strange ways.


186
0:11:35,46 --> 0:11:39,383
After we die, we'll know
why certain things happen.


187
0:11:39,383 --> 0:11:44,295
Today, you won't understand it.
" So I bought the package


188
0:11:44,295 --> 0:11:47,681
and then I said "Why does
a flood drown children.


189
0:11:47,681 --> 0:11:50,102
They've had no experience."


190
0:11:50,102 --> 0:11:53,536
He said "Because the Lord
works in strange ways.


191
0:11:53,536 --> 0:11:58,611
We may not know that, but there
is a reason for everything."


192
0:11:58,611 --> 0:12:2,101
Then he gave me some
reasons, he did.


193
0:12:2,101 --> 0:12:7,648
He said a man he met went
blind due to cataracts.


194
0:12:7,648 --> 0:12:11,42
The blind man said
"Since I was blind


195
0:12:11,42 --> 0:12:16,591
I realized a lot of things that I
didn't appreciate in the past."


196
0:12:16,591 --> 0:12:19,255
He said "The purpose of
that guy going blind


197
0:12:19,255 --> 0:12:24,167
was to give him the realization of
how wonderful it is to have sight


198
0:12:24,167 --> 0:12:27,618
and then how wonderful
it is to have senses.


199
0:12:27,618 --> 0:12:29,881
There's a reason
for everything."


200
0:12:29,881 --> 0:12:34,932
That stalled my ability
to think things out.


201
0:12:34,932 --> 0:12:39,188
It was a good example,
and then going on


202
0:12:39,188 --> 0:12:44,604
I didn't find blind men particularly
smarter than anyone else.


203
0:12:44,604 --> 0:12:49,22
This particular blind man
that he quoted, yes it did


204
0:12:49,22 --> 0:12:52,343
but there are many people that
have a negative experience


205
0:12:52,343 --> 0:12:54,834
and it makes them more negative.


206
0:12:54,834 --> 0:12:57,32
Do you understand what
I'm talking about?


207
0:12:57,32 --> 0:12:59,685
It's very hard to be objective


208
0:12:59,685 --> 0:13:6,9
and I found conflict in the early
stages of beginning to question things.


209
0:13:6,9 --> 0:13:10,271
I found "Well, it's better if
you go to church once a month"


210
0:13:10,271 --> 0:13:12,804
you know, not give
it up entirely


211
0:13:12,804 --> 0:13:16,792
so I said "God would
know I was false then."


212
0:13:16,792 --> 0:13:19,42
Then I didn't have
to go once a month


213
0:13:19,42 --> 0:13:23,416
because I said "I can't
put it over on God."


214
0:13:23,416 --> 0:13:27,198
Then I learned more
about evolution


215
0:13:27,198 --> 0:13:31,234
and learned more about
God sacrificing His son


216
0:13:31,234 --> 0:13:36,601
and if He knows everything He would
know that His son would be crucified.


217
0:13:36,601 --> 0:13:41,52
Then it didn't make sense.
I began to question that whole pattern.


218
0:13:41,52 --> 0:13:45,701
It went in circles, you know what I mean?
Then I pulled out


219
0:13:45,701 --> 0:13:50,18
but if I didn't question the patterns.
I don't think I could make it.


220
0:13:50,18 --> 0:13:53,391
If I wasn't shoved
further enough along


221
0:13:53,391 --> 0:13:55,905
I wouldn't have
questioned anything.


222
0:13:55,905 --> 0:13:58,392
Here you're being shoved


223
0:13:58,392 --> 0:15:58,392
and from now on you'll
question more things.
