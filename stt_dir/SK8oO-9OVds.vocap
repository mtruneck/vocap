###0 JOHN DURANT: Today I wanted to talk about paleo
###2 as bio-hacking, which may be a little bit different than how
###7 it's currently portrayed in the press.
###9 A lot of the pieces on the paleo diet, or the cave man diet,
###13 in the press are a little bit cartoonish.
###17 I'm a little bit responsible for that.
###20 But it often gets portrayed as the macho man eating raw meats
###25 straight off the bone wearing a loin
###26 cloth, which is pretty silly.
###30 But that's sort of the way that a lot of journalists
###33 portray it.
###35 My book, and this approach, is actually about something
###37 much bigger than paleo or the paleolithic or even just
###41 diet, which is starting to take evolution, human evolution,
###45 seriously when we think about human health.
###49 The current state of health recommendations
###53 in this country and the world is awful.
###57 So many people want to be healthy,
###60 but are confused by conflicting advice.
###63 You know, should I do Atkins?
###64 Should I go vegetarian?
###66 Health issues, ethical issues, environmental issues.
###71 For weight loss or autoimmune conditions?
###75 Should I count calories?
###76 Is fat evil?
###77 Are there types of fat that aren't evil?
###79 There's a lot of mass confusion out there.
###81 And there are a lot of eating disorders, clearly obesity,
###85 type 2 diabetes.
###86 People are living a long time, but the question is,
###90 are they thriving and being healthy?
###92 So the broader concept that I want to talk about today
###95 isn't just diet or isn't just the paleolithic,
###98 but starting to use our evolutionary past
###103 to generate really smart heuristics that are probably
###106 pretty close to being right in pretty short order.
###110 
###117 I'm sure you guys are very familiar with some principles
###119 of hacking or bio-hacking.
###122 And I just sort of want to do a comparison between principals
###125 of hacking or bio-hacking, and what this broader paleo
###130 sphere is doing in the health world.
###133 So trial-and-error is very important--
###135 hands-on, do-it-yourself, self-experimentation, n equals
###138 1, experiments.
###141 And speed-- move fast.
###146 Embrace failure-- break things.
###147 80% solutions-- don't let the perfect
###152 be the enemy of the good.
###154 Resourcefulness-- repurposing old features
###159 for new uses, accidental discoveries.
###162 I'm moving very quickly over these
###163 because I feel like this audience is probably
###165 very familiar with this type of stuff.
###168 Simplicity-- keep it simple stupid.
###170 Decentralization.
###171 All these hacking principles.
###173 What's also cool about these principles
###175 is it's actually have evolution by natural selection works.
###179 It's an amateurish process without
###182 any overarching authority.
###186 It isn't concerned with theory.
###189 Organisms are always using whatever
###192 a bits are lying around as material for new functions
###198 and features.
###200 It's sort of a blind, trial-and-error search process.
###204 
###209 So when you actually look at this broader paleo movement,
###213 whether you call it that word.
###214 Maybe another word is better-- ancestral health,
###217 evolutionary health, evolutionary medicine.
###220 Again, you have a lot of similar features.
###223 You basically have a lot of amateurs out there
###226 who have said a lot of the top-down advice
###229 that we're getting from health officials at the USDA
###232 or in the government or my corporate health program
###236 or my health insurance policy don't seem to be working.
###242 And so maybe it's time to start treating your own health
###246 as a do-it-yourself activity.
###249 Because if you want to prevent chronic health conditions,
###251 there's no magic pill you can take.
###253 There's no surgery that you can conduct
###255 to prevent the onset of obesity and type 2 diabetes
###259 and Alzheimer's and things like that.
###261 You actually have to take day-to-day in your daily life
###264 to prevent all these things.
###266 So in a sense, we're all bio-hackers
###269 if we want to be healthy.
###270 We have to do it yourself.
###272 
###275 Over the last few years, this sort of paleo approach
###280 has been pounding the pavement on things like saturated fat.
###285 And that a lot of the science on saturated fat
###287 has been distorted, or poorly conducted,
###293 publishing biases to make saturated fat look bad.
###298 But over the last couple years of iteration of people
###301 experimenting with their own blood work,
###304 with different levels of saturated fat in their diet,
###308 people have very quickly realized,
###310 wait a second, saturated fat is not this evil thing.
###313 40% of all fats in human breast milk or saturated.
###317 About 40% of all the fats in the human body are saturated.
###320 We've had saturated fat in our diet for millions of years
###323 from bone marrow and brains.
###325 So our metabolism is well-adapted to metabolizing,
###330 to harnessing it as an energy source.
###334 So you see issues like that where
###337 this bottom-up, open source community is moving much faster
###340 than the conventional health authorities.
###344 Embracing failure.
###347 There are folks in the paleosphere who
###351 get into fights about whether eating a legume
###354 is going to kill you or not, or give you kidney stones.
###357 Or rice or wheat.
###360 A lot of people are talking about gluten-free.
###364 Is having a little bit of gluten going to cause stomach problems
###370 and digestive problems in any one?
###372 Is this overblown?
###373 So there may be some areas where this burgeoning
###376 movement is wrong.
###377 That's OK.
###378 People are moving fast.
###379 They're experimenting.
###380 And they're going to see whether it works or not.
###383 We don't have to go through all the rest of these.
###386 
###387 So much my book actually isn't mostly about the paleolithic,
###390 even though it uses the word paleo.
###392 And so I want to introduce the structure
###395 that I use to think about human evolution and any health issue
###401 that you want to deal with-- not just food, not just
###403 movement or anything.
###404 So this is a typical singularity chart from Kurzweil
###411 from life to today, the growth of complexity
###416 or major transitions over that period of time.
###421 And so I sort of structure my thinking
###423 into five main buckets, as we think
###426 about human evolution from the beginning of life to today.
###430 What I call the Animal Age, or basically
###432 from the Cambrian explosion to the beginning the Paleolithic,
###437 pre-human essentially.
###440 We can learn a lot from other species and our common ancestry
###445 with other species about how to be healthy, whether it's food,
###449 whether its movement.
###449 
###452 Then you get the Paleolithic for about 2.6 million years.
###455 That's when you get hominids and humans emerging.
###462 Then you get the Agricultural Age.
###464 After the agricultural revolution,
###466 we domesticate plants and animals,
###468 start living in cities.
###470 Our lifestyles change dramatically.
###472 The industrial age.
###474 And the information age.
###475 And we can use this simple five-age, five-era framework
###483 to in really quick fashion get a handle, 80% of the way there
###489 on pretty much any health issue.
###490 
###493 And start to cut through a lot of noise that's
###497 out there about how to be healthy.
###500 Should we eat saturated fat?
###502 How much sun exposure should we get?
###504 How much should we move?
###505 And in what ways are the best ways to exercise?
###507 And all of these questions that just fill the bookstores
###511 with diet books and health books and all this nuttiness.
###514 It doesn't have to be this complicated.
###516 So some of the heuristics that we
###520 can learn when we look at other species
###521 is any health dynamic you care about-- thermal regulation,
###526 diet, movement, anything-- the best way
###531 to learn about it is to completely forget human beings
###534 and just look at other species.
###535 And compare that dynamic across different species.
###539 Because as soon as you start talking about humans,
###542 everybody has preconceived notions about how to do it.
###547 People have a lot of-- particularly in food,
###549 food is like religion-- people have all these identity--
###553 it's a source of identity for a lot of people.
###555 And so you can't have an honest conversation about what should
###558 I eat or what should I not eat?
###561 So if you look at our common ancestry with other species,
###566 you can be like, OK, well there are herbivores.
###570 There are carnivores.
###571 There are omnivores.
###572 And if you go to a zoo, the basic approach
###575 that the top zoos in the world take,
###577 is they use modern science and medical technology
###580 to keep the animals alive.
###582 But then they mimic the natural habitat and lifestyle
###584 of the species in relevant ways, in the most relevant ways.
###589 And so it just depends on the species.
###592 You want to feed red meat and whole prey
###595 feeding to the lions and the carnivores.
###598 And you want to feed grass to the herbivores,
###601 or whatever plant species they're adapted to.
###603 And omnivores have more dietary flexibility.
###608 Immediately you can start to realize that, first of all,
###614 there's no particular food out there that is necessarily
###616 inherently unhealthy.
###619 It depends on whether that species is adapted to it.
###625 Plenty of species are adapted to eating grass.
###628 And they have the microorganisms in their extensive stomach
###633 to digest it all.
###635 We don't.
###638 A second thing that you can learn very quickly about health
###643 from looking at other species-- and again looking
###646 at zoos, because that's where we often have the best
###649 access to them-- is the importance of habitat.
###653 And starting to think about health
###655 in terms of a holistic habitat-based
###657 approach to keeping species healthy.
###659 
###663 I talk about, in my book, a trip to the Cleveland zoo
###666 where they had some obese gorillas.
###670 
###673 Heart disease and heart failure is the number one killer
###676 of male gorillas in captivity, just like heart disease
###679 is the number one killer of male humans in civilization.
###685 And so they were trying to figure out
###686 ways to reverse or halt the progression of heart disease
###691 in these Western lowland gorillas.
###693 And it's kind of like, OK, so what should we do?
###695 They don't really have any fat in their diet,
###698 so low-fat doesn't work.
###701 I guess what they could try to restrict their calories,
###703 but that didn't seem to make sense.
###706 So what they did was they were like, oh wait a second,
###709 maybe we shouldn't be feeding these Western lowland gorillas
###712 wheat, corn, and soy-based fiber bars that are essentially
###716 reformulated dog food.
###718 Of course it's not even dog food,
###720 because that's not what dogs and wolves eat.
###723 
###726 So they switched the gorillas to a bunch of leafy plants
###731 and vegetables that they bought in the local Cleveland grocery
###734 store.
###735 McCullough lost 70 pounds.
###736 Beback lost 35 pounds.
###739 Their blood work improved.
###740 Behavioral problems went away.
###743 All sorts of things like that.
###746 But all of these zoos realized that you
###750 can use modern medical technology
###752 to keep the animals alive for a long period of time,
###755 but if you want to prevent the onset of chronic health
###758 conditions to help them thrive, you
###761 have to take a habitat-based approach.
###763 Because there's no pill, there's no surgery
###765 that can be done to reverse these conditions,
###768 or at least not terribly effectively.
###770 So that gives you your first-pass approach at, OK,
###774 how does this dynamic work?
###775 Forget human beings.
###777 Then the next step is to say, OK well,
###780 if we're talking about diet, now how
###784 does this feature manifest in human beings
###788 during a long formative period in human evolution?
###792 During the paleolithic, this 2.6 million year period.
###796 It's not the end of the story.
###799 But it really is sort of the beginning of the story.
###802 I don't think that paleo diets, and paleo this and paleo that
###807 is the end of the conversation.
###809 It's more like it's the appropriate beginning
###812 of the conversation.
###814 So if you were talking about diet, that's where you realize,
###820 you talk to paleo anthropologists
###821 and realize that humans have been eating
###824 meat for 2.6 million years or longer.
###827 There are cut marks on bones that we
###829 have going back that long.
###831 And so right off the bat, you're just immediately
###835 skeptical of claims that veganism or vegetarianism are
###840 the optimal ways for humans to be healthy because it's
###842 like, wait a second, we've been omnivores
###844 for millions of years.
###846 There are no known vegan or vegetarian indigenous
###850 populations.
###853 And the introduction of meat into the human diet
###856 is, does appear, to be related, in part,
###862 to the expansion of our brains.
###865 And so the paleolithic gives you this first-pass approximation
###869 of what might be a healthy lifestyle, healthy diet,
###874 temperature changes, circadian rhythms, sleep patterns, all
###879 of this.
###880 It gives you a first-pass approximation
###882 of what might be a healthy pattern for human beings today.
###886 It doesn't guarantee that there aren't
###888 new ways of doing things that are better,
###890 new foods that might be healthier or better.
###893 But for the amateur trying to quickly arrive
###897 at good heuristics, it's the right place to start.
###901 Then after the agricultural revolution,
###904 people start living in cities.
###905 We become farmers and herders instead
###908 of hunters and gatherers.
###911 And so, then you take into account recent adaptations.
###915 So just because a food is novel doesn't
###918 mean it's bad or unhealthy.
###922 So, for example, most people's favorite foods
###927 come from fermentation, whether it's alcohol or cheese or bread
###932 or a lot of things the harness microorganisms
###937 and the process of fermentation to be created.
###939 So we can take into account recent cultural adaptations.
###943 We can also take into account genetic adaptations.
###947 You look at alcohol, and populations
###949 that have been drinking alcohol for 5,000 years
###953 handle it better than indigenous populations that
###956 have been drinking alcohol for three generations.
###961 They're just not adapted to metabolizing alcohol well.
###967 If you come from European or Middle Eastern ancestry,
###973 our ancestors went through a process
###976 where there were probably lots of people dying of alcoholism.
###979 But it happened 5,000 years ago.
###983 And I won't go too much into this,
###986 but one of the heuristics that's very important
###989 is realizing the importance of culture,
###991 both culture in the forms of ideas and microbes
###994 to human health.
###997 So then you get the Industrial Age.
###999 And the Industrial Age and the Industrial Revolution
###1002 over the last couple hundred years
###1003 is pretty much a warning of what not to do.
###1006 This is the simple heuristic.
###1008 
###1011 The British Navy sends a bunch of sailors out on ships.
###1015 And they alter their food so that it doesn't perish,
###1018 and don't realize that these guys are going to get scurvy
###1021 because there's no Vitamin C in what they're eating.
###1025 Or people move indoors and they don't get any sunlight.
###1029 And then people get rickets.
###1031 So we started changing things in human lives
###1036 so quickly during the Industrial Revolution
###1038 that we weren't able to adapt culturally or genetically.
###1043 Rickets, pellagra, scurvy, even explorers
###1050 going in novel habitats during the Industrial
###1052 Age, a flight going undersea.
###1058 This industrial technology was literally
###1060 pushing human beings in habitats that we had never
###1062 experienced over eons of genetic and cultural evolution.
###1069 And we learned how to kill ourselves.
###1072 We killed ourselves at the beginning of the Industrial
###1075 Revolution through lack of sun exposure and rickets,
###1080 through missing micronutrients, changing our diet so quickly
###1084 and shifting to a diet of refined flour and sugar
###1087 and alcohol that we were missing key micronutrients
###1090 from our diet.
###1091 And then by the end of the Industrial Age,
###1093 we figure out that we need to add certain things back in
###1097 and fortified foods with them.
###1098 But we were just solving problems of our own creation.
###1101 So the big lesson from the Industrial Age
###1103 is learning how to not die basically.
###1105 
###1108 And then today in the Information Age
###1111 we're now in a position to-- the last piece of this
###1115 is personal experimentation and customizing solutions to you.
###1119 
###1122 Because everybody has a unique genome, unique gut bacteria,
###1127 allergies, injuries, tastes, preferences, budgets,
###1131 so we're all unique organisms.
###1133 We all live in a unique habitat.
###1134 We're all going to end up with somewhat unique diets
###1137 or lifestyles that work for us.
###1139 So let's take food.
###1142 A lot of people that hear about the paleo diet,
###1144 they just think of the paleolithic.
###1146 And the basic prescriptions are--
###1152 all the conventional health authorities pretty much
###1155 agree that too much industrial foods is bad for you.
###1158 So all their advice, from the Mayo Clinic
###1162 to Doctor Oz to Michael Pollan to everybody
###1165 is basically avoid industrial food.
###1168 Processed food-- Twinkies and Coca-Cola
###1172 and refined sugar and all that.
###1175 So it basically boils down to, eat
###1178 like we did before the Industrial Revolution.
###1180 Eat like you sort of grew up on a farm.
###1183 You had whole grain bread and milk and cheese and organic.
###1189 Everything was organic.
###1191 We were still poor.
###1192 But everything was organic.
###1193 
###1196 So all of that health advice basically
###1198 boils down to eat like a farmer.
###1200 Eat like a herder-farmer.
###1201 
###1204 And that may be enough for a lot of people.
###1207 Avoiding industrial food for a lot of people, particularly
###1211 young people, may be completely fine and sufficient.
###1216 But it's not for a lot of other folks.
###1218 And so what paleo adds to the mix is saying,
###1221 OK well, the Agricultural Revolution introduced
###1225 two huge food groups into the human diet
###1227 they basically hadn't been consumed
###1229 before-- grains and legumes and domesticated seeds,
###1236 basically, and dairy from domesticated animals.
###1240 I don't know if anybody here has milked a wild animal.
###1244 It's not easy.
###1244 It's possible, not easy.
###1248 So what this adds, a little more perspective,
###1252 and says OK, well people four hundred generations ago,
###1258 only started to eat tons of wheat and corn
###1261 and diets shifted from being very diverse,
###1266 lots of different animal species,
###1268 lots of different parts of the animal,
###1269 lots of different types of plants depending
###1272 on the geography and the season, to a diet heavily concentrated
###1277 in a few staple cereal crops-- wheat, corn, barley, oats.
###1283 And then products made from that, bread and beer and things
###1286 like.
###1287 So paleo adds that piece to the puzzle in food.
###1298 So what I recommend people do is-- first off,
###1302 if you feel fine with your health and the way
###1305 that you're eating, there may be no reason to change anything.
###1310 If you feel fine and there aren't any issues, then
###1315 what's the problem?
###1317 However, if eating an agricultural diet
###1321 isn't working for you, then what you might want to explore
###1325 is diets that were more common during this prior period
###1329 in human evolution-- so removing grains, removing dairy
###1333 for a time, and trying to mimic an approximation-- we realize
###1338 it's an approximation.
###1340 And then add back in novel modern foods
###1344 and see how you feel.
###1346 I know many people who are very strict on gluten and grains.
###1351 Many have to be.
###1353 Many just want to be.
###1356 And I know more people who are flex on dairy,
###1361 and when they eat it it'll be more
###1362 like full-fat traditional dairy.
###1365 And then just see how you feel.
###1368 And this is sort of the bio-hacking part of it.
###1370 You've got to experiment.
###1372 And based on your ancestry and your genome and your gut
###1375 bacteria and what you like, you just
###1377 have to craft your own diet.
###1380 
###1382 Let me give you one more example,
###1384 and then maybe we can go to questions.
###1385 I don't know what time it is.
###1387 AUDIENCE: It's about 3:30.
###1387 JOHN DURANT: 3:30?
###1388 
###1390 The paleolithic doesn't help you with all areas.
###1394 And this is why I get a little frustrated with the term paleo,
###1397 even though I use it and promote it.
###1399 So take sleep, as an example.
###1403 The big change in human sleep patterns
###1406 didn't happen between the paleolithic
###1408 and the agricultural revolution.
###1410 People still lived with their extended family
###1414 in fairly close quarters and had no indoor lighting and things
###1420 like that.
###1421 The big transition in sleep was between the Agricultural Age
###1424 and the Industrial Age when you get indoor lighting,
###1428 you get more stimulants like coffee and tea
###1432 to keep people up, more alco-- well
###1435 I guess alcohol was way before-- clocks, things like that.
###1442 And then people increasingly sleeping in isolation
###1445 from others, in their own rooms, on softer and softer bedding.
###1450 So most of the big key transition,
###1454 most of the key changes, when it comes to sleep,
###1457 have nothing to do with the paleolithic.
###1459 And you can actually get an approximation
###1461 of a healthy way of sleeping and sleep patterns
###1465 from looking at our agricultural era ancestors.
###1467 
###1470 So the paleolithic doesn't always
###1473 hold the solutions to everything.
###1475 
###1478 We don't always need it, depending on the issue.
###1481 But people focus on diet so much that that's
###1486 what it gets associated with.
###1488 
###1491 Do I have anything else?
###1493 No.
###1493 So if people now have specific questions,
###1496 let's open it up to questions.
###1498 AUDIENCE: What do you mean exactly by [INAUDIBLE]?
###1503 JOHN DURANT: By what?
###1503 AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?
###1506 JOHN DURANT: So people would sleep near a fire, usually.
###1514 There were lots of people around.
###1516 There wasn't very much privacy.
###1519 There are a lot of folks who think
###1521 that sleep was less less of a single uninterrupted stretch
###1527 of seven or eight hours and more broken up into two periods.
###1530 Or you'd sleep for a while, wake up, have sex,
###1533 go to the bathroom, chat with someone by the fire,
###1536 go back to sleep for a few hours.
###1539 Night was a long time.
###1541 And you couldn't do much when it was dark.
###1545 So that's sort of what it was like.
###1547 But it didn't change too much when people started farming.
###1552 And then they were living in little huts
###1554 with extended family scrunched together
###1557 around the fire for all night.
###1560 
###1565 Other questions?
###1568 AUDIENCE: From on VC behind you.
###1570 You can't see me actually, I think.
###1572 JOHN DURANT: Hi.
###1573 
###1575 AUDIENCE: When I was at [INAUDIBLE] from Hamburg,
###1577 Germany.
###1579 And thanks again for doing all this.
###1582 Paleo has done a lot for me.
###1583 Listened to you recently on Robb Wolf again.
###1586 It's just amazing stuff that you guys are doing.
###1588 JOHN DURANT: Thanks.
###1589 AUDIENCE: So my question is-- so [INAUDIBLE]
###1594 a lot of people around you there as well.
###1595 I have a lot of people, when you say,
###1597 you know when people say they are fine with what they're
###1599 eating and they way they're feeling, then [INAUDIBLE].
###1603 So the two questions that I have around that is, you know, A,
###1608 how do they know that they couldn't
###1609 feel much, much better, right?
###1611 I feel like we've been doing that sort of stuff
###1613 for a long time.
###1614 We don't even know.
###1615 [INAUDIBLE]?
###1617 JOHN DURANT: Right.
###1618 AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] basically.
###1620 All their lives.
###1620 So, that's the one question.
###1622 The other one is, I feel like-- so you
###1626 say a lot of young people especially,
###1628 I think what you mean is that a lot of people, their
###1630 their metabolism is much more forgiving than, for example,
###1633 later in time.
###1634 JOHN DURANT: Right.
###1635 AUDIENCE: What is [INAUDIBLE] that
###1636 is accumulating over this period that sort of, you know,
###1640 lifestyle, that could be prevented,
###1643 and would not even lead to issues in the 30s, 40s, 50s,
###1647 whenever.
###1648 JOHN DURANT: So, thanks for your questions.
###1651 For the first question, yeah, people
###1653 tend to accept their lives as normal.
###1659 They confuse the word normal with common.
###1662 I do it.
###1662 Everybody here does it.
###1663 Just because it's common in North America
###1666 to live a certain way doesn't mean
###1668 it's necessarily species typical in a biological sense.
###1675 So they have the same problem in zoos.
###1679 They run studies on the health of all the captive gorillas
###1682 in North American zoos.
###1684 But they actually can't conclude very much because they all
###1686 lead very similar lives and very similar circumstances,
###1690 eating very similar food.
###1692 And so if you actually want to see real differences in gorilla
###1695 help, you have to compare them with their wild counterparts.
###1698 But the reason why I say, however you're eating,
###1703 if you feel great, fine is partly because I
###1705 don't want to push people too much.
###1709 And we can eat novel foods, and we can live in new ways
###1712 and that's fine.
###1713 So I'm just trying to do more of the soft sell, I guess.
###1718 But I think people would be surprised
###1721 about how many conditions they accept as normal that
###1730 don't necessarily have to be.
###1733 You get teenagers that accept it as normal
###1737 that they will need braces and to get tons of acne.
###1741 And this causes like a lot of social anxiety,
###1745 and like self-esteem issues.
###1747 And we treat it as this normal rite of passage
###1752 through adolescence.
###1755 But the reason why our teeth are crowded
###1758 is because our jaws have gotten smaller
###1761 over the last some thousands of years because the food we eat
###1764 isn't very tough.
###1766 It's very soft.
###1767 And so our jaws don't grow as large
###1770 as they do when we had tougher foods.
###1773 And so our jaws aren't large enough to fit all of our teeth.
###1778 And some of those strong bite forces
###1782 are what the body uses to help your teeth come in straight.
###1785 When you look at these hunter gatherer skulls--
###1787 and I've gotten to examine some of them-- 80,000 years ago,
###1790 beautiful set of teeth.
###1791 Not perfect, but wisdom teeth came in,
###1794 there was enough room in the jaw for the wisdom teeth
###1796 to come in.
###1797 No cavities.
###1799 And straight.
###1800 So that's--
###1802 AUDIENCE: I'm sorry.
###1803 Are you saying that's an evolutionary change over 80,000
###1806 years, or is that a specific change
###1808 over the lifetime because an individual is chewing
###1811 less, that their jaw grows less.
###1813 JOHN DURANT: Individual chewing less,
###1815 though there are some lines of evidence
###1818 that maybe the human had has actually
###1822 gotten a little bit smaller over the last 10,000 years.
###1825 Our brains actually used to be a little bit bigger
###1828 than they are today.
###1831 Near the end the paleolithic.
###1833 I don't know what that means.
###1836 Your second question was about-- what was your second question?
###1842 Oh youth, youth.
###1845 So definitely young people can-- there's
###1849 very interesting evolutionary-- the evolutionary biology
###1853 of aging is a very fascinating area.
###1855 There's a guy named Michael Rose at UC Irvine who's probably
###1858 the preeminent guy in this field.
###1861 And a lot of people think of aging as sort of simply just
###1867 damage accumulating, like a car rolls off
###1871 the lot at wherever they sell cars--
###1880 AUDIENCE: Dealership.
###1880 JOHN DURANT: --at a dealership.
###1883 And then from then on out, it sort of just
###1885 accumulates damage.
###1887 But during the period of time before the typical first stage
###1894 of reproduction, we've basically evolved incredible repair
###1900 mechanisms.
###1902 So let me put it this way, if you get a genetic defect that
###1908 causes you to die when you're four or five,
###1910 your genes don't get passed on to the next generation at all.
###1914 Kaput.
###1916 You're out.
###1917 You're out of the gene pool.
###1919 But if you get that same genetic defect when you're 50,
###1923 you still have time to have offspring.
###1926 So basically, depending on the first typical age
###1930 of reproduction of a species, evolution
###1932 selects for incredible robust health.
###1937 We grow stronger as we get older.
###1939 We become more robust from birth to adolescence,
###1944 and then we start to accumulate damage.
###1946 So young people are actually pretty well adapted
###1954 to some aspects of an agricultural diet.
###1958 Young people are probably better adapted
###1960 to some of those foods than those same individuals later
###1964 in life.
###1964 It's a very counter-intuitive concept.
###1967 But there's been selection pressures for young kids
###1972 to be able to survive on these diets,
###1974 to make it to the age at which they reproduce.
###1977 There has not been the same sort of selection,
###1980 or as strong of selection, for older people.
###1984 So there are a lot of people, for example,
###1987 who end up getting Celiac later in life.
###1991 There was some traumatic event, or childbirth,
###1994 or just getting older.
###1996 Either Celiac or not being able to digest lactose.
###1999 They become lactose intolerant later in life.
###2001 You start to notice it among folks.
###2004 My grandmother developed Celiac late in life.
###2008 And it's possible that for some of these more novel foods,
###2011 we're better adapted to them when
###2013 we're young and less adapted to them when we're older.
###2015 So it may become more important to eat
###2019 more of a paleolithic diet the older you get.
###2023 Some of that is hypothesis.
###2025 AUDIENCE: Can I jump in on that just really quickly, sorry.
###2028 AUDIENCE: Well let-- OK.
###2031 AUDIENCE: Just because it's a very tangible thing.
###2034 [INAUDIBLE] a lot of money into keeping
###2038 Googlers healthy, right?
###2039 JOHN DURANT: Right.
###2040 Like free M&Ms and stuff like that?
###2043 AUDIENCE: They've reduced those.
###2044 AUDIENCE: And we get massages, and adjustable tables and gyms
###2049 and that sort of stuff.
###2051 And we have a lot of people that started around age, I
###2053 don't know, 20, 25 here.
###2055 And then as they continue working here,
###2057 they get out of shape, but they think
###2059 that's the natural course of life basically.
###2061 So what would you tell Google as a company to say, hey, look,
###2065 your people just don't have to get sick and fat, right?
###2067 [LAUGHTER]
###2069 JOHN DURANT: That's right.
###2070 Well, you could start to model workplaces
###2073 on little hunter gatherer tribes.
###2076 Less clothing and things like.
###2077 
###2081 When you look at traditional people, indigenous folks,
###2084 living in traditional ways, they have health problems
###2089 of their own-- infant mortality, things
###2090 like that-- but they tend to live into their 60s, 70s,
###2094 and even the 80s in some cases in robust health.
###2098 The 70-year-olds, they're not bed-ridden with arthritis
###2102 and have Alzheimer's.
###2104 There like carrying pails of water into their 70s
###2108 and hiking up hills and things like that.
###2111 And if you were a hunter gatherer,
###2114 you had to, at a minimum, be able to move with your tribe
###2118 whenever it migrated.
###2120 And so it gives you a new sense of what's normal.
###2128 What I like about the way that Google thinks about health
###2132 is really thinking about the habitat.
###2135 Saying OK, your habitat has a big influence on whether you
###2140 eat something or don't.
###2141 If we put a cover on it and make it less visible,
###2144 fewer people eat the candy.
###2146 I think that's one of the changes that happened here.
###2149 And what's good about re-engineering your habitat
###2155 is it doesn't require as much willpower and discipline.
###2159 So many people, when they get into dieting,
###2162 they think they're changing themselves.
###2164 Like I have to change myself.
###2166 And I have to become a better person.
###2167 And I'm going to do this through willpower and discipline.
###2170 And that's part of the reason why everybody fails at it.
###2173 Because you can't-- nobody is perfectly disciplined over
###2178 a long period of time.
###2179 You have to find ways of using discipline
###2184 in a short period of time to change your habitat
###2187 so that it makes it easy to be healthy
###2188 even when you're not disciplined.
###2191 Or the way that you lead your life, the food you eat
###2195 and how you move, it has to be meaningful to you in some way.
###2200 Calories are not meaningful to people.
###2203 Most people are not motivated by calories.
###2204 
###2211 Going to hunt a wild animal to bring back a lot of meat
###2218 to try to impress the girl in the tribe that you like,
###2222 that motivated people.
###2224 So you have to think about ways to either change your habitat
###2228 or make a healthy lifestyle meaningful to people
###2231 so that's it doesn't require discipline.
###2235 AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] when you said
###2238 there was a lot of danger in doing agricultural industrial.
###2241 And I'm asking but now I'm five days in [INAUDIBLE] all
###2245 the things that can happen if you make
###2248 a switch from the Information Age,
###2251 where I've been eating processed foods, breads,
###2253 but then I just stop.
###2255 Right?
###2255 And I just stop and start eating meant
###2258 and vegetables and some fruits.
###2260 And are there dangers going the other way?
###2264 Like, I read [INAUDIBLE] so there's obviously
###2268 a lot of fear factors, but like how real are they
###2270 for doing an abrupt change in diet?
###2272 
###2277 JOHN DURANT: One thing people will
###2278 notice with abrupt changes is particularly around sugar.
###2282 People eat a lot of sugar today.
###2284 And if you eat a lot of sugar, and then you cut it out
###2287 of your diet, you're basically going
###2289 through withdrawal of a drug.
###2292 And it's not pleasant.
###2295 Lightheadedness, shaky hands, inability
###2297 to concentrate, anxiety.
###2301 So that can be difficult.
###2303 
###2307 Unless somebody has some sort of specific, severe health issue,
###2315 I do tend to think that trying to go more or less whole hog,
###2319 for a short period of time, is the best way to do it.
###2324 And you just got a monitor how you feel.
###2328 You'll see better results.
###2330 Or you'll have a better validation
###2332 of whatever results you get.
###2333 
###2338 And you can harness that period of discipline.
###2341 A lot of people can be disciplined
###2343 for a week or two weeks.
###2344 Few people can just be disciplined for two years.
###2348 So rather than trying to go sort of 5p% for a long period
###2351 of time, just going 100%.
###2354 Other risks-- with diet I don't think there are as many risks.
###2361 With exercise, yeah.
###2364 If people just like immediately jump into a hard CrossFit
###2367 workout without learning Olympic lifts,
###2369 you can injure your back.
###2370 
###2373 But for most people, sugar is the biggest immediate obstacle.
###2378 
###2381 AUDIENCE: So I'm vegan.
###2383 And I actually agree a lot with the paleo mindset.
###2388 I think there's a lot more in common than--
###2390 JOHN DURANT: I agree.
###2391 AUDIENCE: --as far as focusing on whole foods, et cetera.
###2393 
###2396 And I think it gets overblown in the media how much meat you
###2399 do have to eat.
###2400 I think too much is bad.
###2402 I don't think necessarily [INAUDIBLE]
###2404 the only way to do things.
###2406 So I was just curious, kind of, I
###2408 guess you thoughts on diet, maybe your day-to-day diet.
###2412 JOHN DURANT: Well let me talk about the vegan/ paleo thing
###2416 for a second.
###2417 In the press, it's often portrayed as polar opposites.
###2421 I do tend to think of paleo and vegan as more like yin yang.
###2423 
###2428 I have no problem with people eating however
###2432 they want to eat.
###2432 And I respect vegans and vegetarians
###2434 a lot for being conscious eaters.
###2438 Where it does grate on me a little bit is if people then
###2441 turn around and say, this is an optimal human diet.
###2445 That's where I become a bit more combative and disagree.
###2450 
###2454 And here's the thing.
###2455 Any dietary approach-- Atkins, vegan, paleo,
###2458 whatever-- that gets people to eat less industrial food,
###2463 is going to work to some extent.
###2465 Less refined sugar, refined flour, high fructose corn
###2470 syrup.
###2471 Any approach that gets people to reduce that
###2474 will have some success at least for a time.
###2477 And then, I have much more in common with how vegans
###2481 eat than probably the average Western diet.
###2489 What was the last piece?
###2490 How do I eat on a daily basis?
###2492 AUDIENCE: Yeah what's your day-to-day?
###2493 JOHN DURANT: I often don't eat breakfast.
###2496 I don't wake up terribly hungry.
###2499 Sometimes, if I do have breakfast, I'll have some eggs
###2503 and spinach.
###2505 Or I'll have a bowl of heavy cream, because I
###2507 eat some dairy, and a sliced up banana, which is delicious.
###2514 Lunch-- sushi.
###2516 I don't worry about a little bit of white rice or anything
###2519 like that.
###2521 Sushi, sashimi, Mongolian barbecue, meat and vegetables,
###2526 a Cobb salad, something like that.
###2529 And then dinner would be a piece of fish, sweet potato,
###2533 and a side salad.
###2534 I mean, it's not that radical.
###2538 But it is radical over an extended period
###2543 when you realize that gluten and wheat and corn
###2547 are in everything in the grocery store
###2551 except for a few things around the outside.
###2554 AUDIENCE: Question from VC behind you.
###2557 JOHN DURANT: Hi.
###2558 AUDIENCE: So you mentioned white rice.
###2560 And I eat white rice myself because I think it
###2563 doesn't-- at least it doesn't feel as bad wheat does.
###2567 So, and I also read some studies saying that among grains,
###2571 you might actually be better off eating
###2572 white rice than brown rice even, in moderation.
###2577 So thought on that.
###2578 And I'm going to throw in a second question, which
###2581 is you mentioned metabolism as the damage analogy for aging.
###2588 So the simple logic is that the faster your metabolism
###2592 the faster you're going to age.
###2593 But then again, I find, for instance,
###2595 if I sleep on a cold, hard bed, I feel better in the morning,
###2599 and logically I feel like that's the better things to be doing.
###2602 But then part of me is thinking, isn't my body
###2605 trying to burn more fuel to stay warm during the night.
###2607 So I don't know if you have any thoughts on that.
###2610 JOHN DURANT: Well, on rice first.
###2613 In my mental model of grains, wheat is the worst.
###2619 And rice is the least worst, or the best.
###2621 
###2626 Let me give you the 10,000 foot view seeds.
###2629 And when I say seeds, I mean the reproductive organ
###2633 of the plant, and I'm including grains, legumes, nuts,
###2636 and seeds.
###2638 Seeds, as the reproductive organ of the plants,
###2644 have many nutrients in them because it's
###2647 to feed the next generation.
###2650 They also have defense mechanisms.
###2654 Sometimes a shell, which is nature's way of saying
###2656 stay out.
###2658 Or chemicals, toxins or naturally occurring pesticides.
###2663 Plants can't run away from predators.
###2665 They are not mobile.
###2667 So they have to use other mechanisms
###2669 to defend their offspring or the reproductive interests.
###2673 And they usually do that by making
###2675 seeds or the entire plant toxic in some way to insects
###2680 or herbivores.
###2682 They might be OK-- I'm giving them
###2685 agency metaphorically-- they might be OK with an herbivore
###2692 coming along, eating their seeds,
###2694 and then not digesting them and then letting
###2696 them come out in their feces.
###2698 But they're still then covered in a casing
###2702 to prevent them from being digested.
###2703 
###2706 Wild almonds contain cyanide in them.
###2710 Apple seeds also have cyanide in them.
###2712 Many fruit pits are poisonous.
###2715 And every year some kid will eat like a peach pit
###2719 or a nectarine pit and have to go to poison control or die.
###2722 
###2726 You basically go through seeds, and it's
###2728 a huge list of things that can irritate the stomach
###2732 or the reproductive system of the animals
###2735 that are consuming them.
###2736 Sheep in New Zealand and Australia,
###2739 you have to keep them away from certain pasture legumes
###2742 because if the ewes eat too many of them,
###2745 they have higher rates of miscarriage or become fertile,
###2748 which is an adaptation.
###2751 That's exactly what the legumes "want"
###2753 to do because any ewes that have a taste for them
###2758 don't have offspring.
###2761 So there's a general concern with eating diets
###2767 that are high in seeds, particularly the same seed
###2771 over and over, because they can cause a lot of health problems
###2777 in concentrated qualities.
###2779 And if they're not prepared in traditional ways.
###2781 Traditional ways of preparing nuts and seeds and grains
###2784 and legumes-- soaking, fermenting, baking, sprouting.
###2792 All of these traditional methods of preparing seeds
###2795 were ways of deactivating some of these problematic toxins
###2799 in them.
###2799 And we've sort of forgotten that.
###2801 And now we eat tons of wheat, corn, and soy prepared
###2805 in untraditional ways.
###2807 And so that's the main reason for being skeptical of them
###2811 from the outset.
###2812 White rice is basically carbohydrate.
###2814 If you want more carbohydrate in your diet, eat it.
###2818 If you want less, don't.
###2820 I like the texture of it.
###2823 So I eat it.
###2825 And I can handle the carbohydrate.
###2828 What was your other question?
###2830 AUDIENCE: It was about whether increasing metabolism
###2833 by wearing less clothing or exposure to the cold
###2836 is a good thing because then--
###2837 
###2840 JOHN DURANT: Yeah I'm not sure I have
###2842 a very good answer to that question.
###2845 I don't know how much trying to slow down your metabolism
###2852 is feasible, and how much it might or might not
###2855 add to your longevity at the end of your life.
###2858 Is it an extra 20 days when you're 87 years old?
###2861 I don't know.
###2863 So I would do whatever.
###2866 If you get better sleep on a harder surface when
###2870 it's chilly, then I would do that.
###2874 And yeah--
###2878 AUDIENCE: I'm personally really glad I do paleo,
###2880 and I feel fortunate that I can, because there's
###2883 a farmer's market that I can go to.
###2885 And I have the wherewithal to buy expensive grass-fed beef.
###2888 And I live in a country that gives me an internet where
###2891 I can go and I read your blog and listen to podcasts.
###2894 Is there a future for paleo in Africa or in Southeast Asia?
###2901 Is there a future where billions of people around the world
###2905 are eating paleo?
###2906 And can be sustain that?
###2908 
###2910 Is it just sort of like a fad that upper middle-class
###2912 people in America are going to embrace?
###2914 JOHN DURANT: Well, we can learn a lot about human health even
###2919 if everybody in the world does not adopt this diet,
###2922 which they won't.
###2922 Even if everybody had the capability to do so, everybody
###2926 wouldn't.
###2927 So first, the benefit of some people
###2931 experimenting with this is simply
###2933 learning about human metabolism and what makes folks healthy.
###2938 
###2942 Right now, the early years of paleo-- people
###2946 are painting with broad strokes.
###2949 Grains are bad.
###2951 Well maybe it will turn out, over years of research,
###2954 that gluten grains are the worst.
###2957 But if you're dealing with non-gluten grains, quinoa
###2962 or something else, many people can digest that better.
###2966 Or maybe we'll learn that you just
###2968 need to introduce certain types of gut bacteria
###2971 into people's stomachs and then they
###2973 have fewer negative reactions to a particular grain.
###2977 So, there may be changes in how we think about paleo,
###2982 or how we think about different grains that
###2984 make it more accessible to people.
###2987 Or make aspect of paleo irrelevant.
###2990 You mentioned the insect company-- or the cricket
###2994 protein bar company that I'm helping out.
###2996 
###3000 Insects are eaten as a nutritious and inexpensive
###3003 source of protein all over the world,
###3006 except for the Western world.
###3008 But even crickets, grasshoppers, and locusts
###3012 are fine under kosher and halal rules.
###3015 And there's really no good reason
###3019 other than a sense of discuss and tradition,
###3023 recent tradition, to avoid eating insects and taking
###3028 advantage of them.
###3030 The amino acid profile of insects
###3034 is beautiful, most of them.
###3037 You don't have to sort of mix and match protein sources.
###3042 They require fewer resources to raise, water in particular.
###3050 And for ethical reasons, they have a less well-developed
###3055 neurological system, and are adapted
###3059 to living in very close quarters.
###3061 So that's an area where paleo could actually,
###3065 in some respects, make healthy eating more sustainable.
###3072 But is everybody going to live off of grass-fed beef?
###3077 No.
###3078 But you have a small group of people making innovations,
###3082 and it also incentivizes the big players,
###3086 the big agricultural companies to start
###3088 to make changes to how they do things.
###3090 And they can make small tweaks in their supply chain,
###3093 or in their treatment of animals,
###3095 that can have a huge difference on the environment
###3098 and on ethical issues, simply because they're now responding
###3102 to a 2% of the market, 3% of the market, 5% of the market that
###3106 is profitable and growing that they want to get in on.
###3109 
###3112 AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].
###3113 
###3115 JOHN DURANT: All right.
###3116 AUDIENCE: When you look at the line from paleo up,
###3121 the idea agricultural societies fare
###3124 better because they made cheaper [INAUDIBLE].
###3126 That's why.
###3127 It's an evolutionary process also--
###3129 JOHN DURANT: Right.
###3129 It's growth.
###3130 AUDIENCE: --but And so I guess like,
###3133 do you think the cricket thing is like-- I mean,
###3136 those calories are going to be more expensive.
###3138 It's more expensive than simple grains.
###3142 So it's less efficient, more expensive calories.
###3146 Is that the right thing to do when
###3148 throughout all these periods, and we're thinking about,
###3150 how are we going to get enough calories to feed everybody?
###3153 Like throughout these times, there
###3154 have been a hundred people who've
###3156 been like, oh my god, we're not going
###3157 to be able to feed all these people.
###3158 And they come up with some new way
###3160 of breeding some kind of corn, and then OK cool--
###3163 JOHN DURANT: Right, well right now, there
###3165 are enough calories to feed every one,
###3167 and the main impediments are institutions and infrastructure
###3171 and growth in poor parts of the world.
###3176 But if more people continue to eat meat,
###3180 that does take more resources and things like that.
###3184 The problem with corn or soy or any
###3189 of these grains as protein sources
###3190 is they're not very good protein sources.
###3192 They're incomplete.
###3194 And eaten in large quantities, they
###3196 can cause health problems too.
###3198 So I don't know all the details of the ins and outs
###3204 of the resources required to grow insects.
###3207 We're sort of exploring that right now.
###3210 But it's worth exploring, I think.
###3215 AUDIENCE: What's [INAUDIBLE] hacking
###3217 that this is predicated on.
###3219 I was wondering-- let's say my real estate
###3222 for my grandchildren [INAUDIBLE].
###3224 
###3229 What about [INAUDIBLE] cheaper diet with fast food?
###3236 Then you move back towards an expensive diet
###3239 of very good quality food.
###3241 Wouldn't we want, a million years from now,
###3243 everyone to just get refined sugar
###3245 and be perfectly fine with it, and go on with their lives,
###3249 rather than everybody going back to--
###3251 JOHN DURANT: Well that will never happen.
###3252 AUDIENCE: How do you know?
###3254 JOHN DURANT: Well, I mean--
###3255 AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?
###3257 JOHN DURANT: --evolution takes time.
###3259 It takes many, many generations.
###3260 AUDIENCE: I'm just wondering about the direction.
###3262 Why not move--
###3263 AUDIENCE: Bioengineering is faster.
###3265 AUDIENCE: Yeah, why are we not moving
###3267 in that direction [INAUDIBLE] perfectly fine [INAUDIBLE]?
###3271 JOHN DURANT: Well this is an area where I'm probably
###3276 in a little bit of tension with some of the folks here,
###3278 or the tech world.
###3281 Throughout history, you have engineers
###3284 who are very hubristic and think that they can centrally plan
###3287 and design things better than nature does,
###3292 or a better than a decentralized process does.
###3295 And many times they can, then occasionally they
###3297 fail magnificently.
###3300 So yes, we can produce more calories with wheat and corn,
###3306 and feed more people.
###3308 And we can adapt to that somewhat over periods
###3310 of generations.
###3311 But it also exposes you to famine.
###3312 You basically didn't have famine until we became heavily
###3315 dependent on a few cereal grains, and in a sense,
###3319 we put all our eggs in one basket.
###3322 AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] famine throughout
###3326 recorded and unrecorded history and various cultures going back
###3331 tens of thousands of years.
###3334 JOHN DURANT: Hunter gatherers tend
###3335 to have more diverse diets than other people.
###3341 And they're nomadic.
###3342 So when you have a more diverse portfolio,
###3344 you're less likely-- you're less dependent on any one food
###3348 source.
###3349 If it fails, it's not catastrophic.
###3351 And if you're nomadic, you can quickly up and move.
###3354 So it's well established among anthropologists
###3358 that-- it's not to say there weren't periods
###3361 when people ran out of food or went hungry.
###3367 But famine shot up when we started
###3371 betting on a few cereal grains.
###3373 And if you didn't get enough rain,
###3374 or if you didn't store enough grain, boom, you're done.
###3377 You're wiped out.
###3377 AUDIENCE: There was a lot more people to starve. [INAUDIBLE]
###3381 population controlled through agriculture.
###3382 But the Inuit, for example, starved regularly up
###3385 until they integrated into the modern day,
###3389 into the rest of the world.
###3393 JOHN DURANT: I don't know details on that.
###3396 But I bet I would disagree with you on that.
###3399 AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].
###3400 
###3404 JOHN DURANT: Like soylent, like than just raised--
###3406 AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] eventually the human organism
###3409 is going to adapt to it.
###3410 JOHN DURANT: No, no, no, no, no.
###3413 So you only get adaptation if people--
###3420 if there's differential reproductive success--
###3424 if some people are having more babies and other people aren't.
###3429 So you would need, over a very long period of time,
###3434 you would need the people that are thriving best
###3438 on heavily industrial diets to also have the most children.
###3445 I mean, maybe the Chinese are willing to do an experiment
###3447 like that.
###3448 But not in like a democratic society.
###3451 And it requires-- even lactose tolerance is only in about 30--
###3460 it's one gene that had enormous benefits.
###3464 One gene, enormous benefits, and it only moved to about 35%
###3468 of the population in a 6,000 or 7,000 year period.
###3472 That is like the most rapid example
###3474 that we have of something with one
###3477 gene that needs to be flipped, enormous benefits and even
###3481 over 7,000 years or whatever.
###3483 It's 35% of global population.
###3486 So it's not feasible to think that we're
###3493 going to change through--
###3495 AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].
###3496 
###3499 JOHN DURANT: Well there are other mechanisms.
###3502 Bill Gates has been investing in artificial meat sources.
###3510 There are bioengineers working on-- there
###3514 may be ways of engineering bacteria,
###3517 or harnessing bacteria to basically digest inedible food
###3521 sources for us, and then we can digest the output.
###3527 So I think that's where the innovation will happen, not so
###3534 much in whether we change our own genome
###3536 or anything like that.
###3537 AUDIENCE: So we're actually overtime now.
###3539 Can you stick around a little bit?
###3541 JOHN DURANT: Sure, yeah, I can hang.
###3542 AUDIENCE: He'll stick around if you have any extra questions.
###3544 Thanks for coming, John.
###3545 The book's in the back. $10.00 subsidized by Google.
###3547 Check it out.
###3548 It's an awesome book.
###3548 Thanks John.
###3549 JOHN DURANT: Cool.
###3550 Thank you.
