###0 ANYBODY HAVE ANYTHING YOU WANT ME TO REVIEW?
###2 SERE. COULD I REVIEW THE TERM SERE, S-E-R-E.
###15 ALL SERE IS, IS A TERM WE USE FOR THE DIFFERENT
###19 SUCCESSIONAL STAGE THAT'S OCCUR LEADING UP TO
###22 A CLIMAX. IT IS JUST A TERM TO DENOTE A PREDICTABLE
###30 STEP IN THE ORDERLY SEQUENCE OF COMMUNITIES. THAT IS
###34 REALLY ALL IT IS. I PROBABLY COULD HAVE GOTTEN BY
###37 WITHOUT EVEN MENTIONING IT. IS THE TERM TAXON
###45 LIKE SERE? OKAY. YOU HAVE TO SAY IT AGAIN. THE
###65 QUESTION IS, DOES THE TERM TAXON AND SERE HAVE REAL
###71 MEANINGS OR ARE THEY JUST FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE
###74 OBSERVER? WELL, TAXON TENDS TO HAVE A MEANING. WHEN
###77 WE SAY TAXON, WE TEND TO MEAN A PARTICULAR,
###81 A PARTICULAR TAXONOMIC UNIT. NOW, YOU ARE RIGHT, IT
###85 CAN VARY IN THAT SOME PEOPLE REFER TO A SPECIES AS
###88 A TAXON. A GENUS AS A TAXON OR A FAMILY DEPENDING ON
###93 WHAT LEVEL THEY ARE IDENTIFYING IT. SO YOU ARE RIGHT
###95 ON THAT. SERES, YES THEY ARE, THEY ARE IDENTIFIED BY
###100 
###104 SET THAN THE TERM TAXON. IN OTHER WORDS WHEN YOU
###107 DESCRIBE A CERTAIN SERE YOU REALLY MEAN A CERTAIN
###110 STAGE IN THAT SUCCESSION. BUT, YOU ARE RIGHT IT COMES
###112 FROM THE OUTSIDE. IT IS MADE BY A DESCRIBER.
###115 INTERESTING IDEA. NEVER HAD THAT. ANY OTHER
###118 QUESTIONS BEFORE WE START?
###123 OKAY. WE ARE GOING TO ADVANCE TO THE FINAL AND
###127 THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF ECOLOGICAL ORGANIZATION. WE ARE
###132 REALLY GOING ALL OF THE WAY TO THE TOP TODAY. WE ARE
###135 GOING TO THE ECOSYSTEM. TO THE ECOSYSTEM. THIS IS
###139 AGAIN, IN OUR PROGRESSION FROM POPULATIONS TO
###143 COMMUNITIES, TO ECOSYSTEMS. WE ARE GRADUALLY GETTING
###148 MORE COMPLEX. AND, AS YOU CAN SEE BOTH IN YOUR STUDY
###151 SHEETS AND IN WHAT ARE WRITTEN ON THE BOARD,
###155 ECOSYSTEMS ARE THE INTERACTING SYSTEM THAT INVOLVES
###160 BOTH OF LIVING ORGANISMS, IN OTHER WORDS, THE
###162 POPULATIONS IN THE COMMUNITY AND THE NON LIVING
###170 VERY
###170 INTEREST IN THAT IT HAS A VERY, VERY SET DIRECTIONAL
###174 COMPONENT. FOR EXAMPLE, ENERGY FLOWS THROUGH THE
###178 ECOSYSTEM. IT FLOWS FROM THE PRIMARY PRODUCERS TO THE
###183 CONSUMERS TO THE PREDATORS. SO THERE IS THE FLOW OF
###186 ENERGY. BUT, THERE IS THE CYCLING OF NUTRIENTS. AND
###191 THIS CYCLING OF NUTRIENTS AND THE FLOW OF ENERGY IS
###194 REGULATED. IT IS REGULATED AS A FUNCTION OF THE
###197 ECOSYSTEM. SO, WE ARE GOING TO TALK A LOT ABOUT
###200 CYCLING OF NUTRIENTS TODAY. AND, WHY THIS IS
###204 IMPORTANT, CYCLING OF NUTRIENTS, BECAUSE IF YOU THINK
###207 OF CARBON DIOXIDE OR NITROGEN OR OXYGEN OR WATER, THIS
###212 IS REALLY THE SOURCE OF ALL OF THE CARBON, OXYGEN,
###215 HYDROGEN, NITROGEN COMPOUNDS THAT WE USE IN MAKES
###220 PROTEINS AND MAKING AMINO ACIDS IN OUR OWN BODIES. SO
###225 HYDROGEN IS IMPORTANT FOR THE PRODUCTION OF ATP. AS
###231 YOU ALL KNOW IN THE GLYCOLYSIS REACTIONS. SO, THESE
###236 CARBON DIOXIDE, NITROGEN, OXYGEN, THEY REALLY ARE ONLY
###240 
###244 A LIQUID TO A GASEOUS FORM. BUT, EVERYTHING ELSE THAT
###247 WE USE, EVERYTHING ELSE THAT WE NEED COMES FROM THE
###251 EARTH'S CRUST. SO, ALL OF THE MICRONUTRIENTS, ALL OF
###256 THE MACRO NUTRIENTS, SUCH AS THE ONES THAT YOU PUT UP
###258 THERE, THE MOST OBVIOUS, CALCIUM, SODIUM, MAGNESIUM.
###262 MANGANESE, PHOSPHORUS. THEY ALL COME FROM THE EARTH'S
###266 CRUST. SO IT IS ONLY THE CARBON DIOXIDE, NITROGEN,
###271 OXYGEN THAT WE DEPEND ON FROM THE ATMOSPHERE. AND WE
###273 WILL GO INTO THOSE IN DETAIL. LIKEWISE, THESE
###276 MICRONUTRIENTS LIKE SELENIUM AND MOLYBDENUM THEY COME
###279 FROM THE EARTH'S CRUST AS WELL. THAT IS WHERE WE GET
###282 THOSE FROM. SO, LET'S KIND OF LOOK AT ENERGY
###285 TRANSFER. THE WHOLE PROCESS OF ENERGY TRANSFER. WE
###288 KNOW FROM WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT ON WEDNESDAY IS THAT
###292 ABOUT 1 PERCENT OF THE SUNLIGHT THAT FALLS ON LEAVES
###295 AND STEMS ENDS UP GETTING INCORPORATED INTO PLANT
###299 BODIES. THIS IS ABOUT 1 PERCENT. NOW, BUT, THAT 1
###304 
###307 INTO THE PLANT BODY, THERE IS A TRANSFER TO THE
###311 CONSUMER TO IS HERBIVORE THAT FEEDS ON THAT PLANT.
###314 AND THE TRANSFER IS ABOUT 10 PERCENT. IT IS ABOUT
###319 A 10 PERCENT TRANSFER. NOW, IF YOU LOOK AT THE
###323 TRANSFER OF ENERGY, WE CAN THINK OF IT AS CALORIES OR
###328 POUNDS, FROM OUR PRIMARY PRODUCER TO OUR SECONDARY,
###336 NOT PRODUCERS, OUR SECONDARY PRODUCTION, WHICH ARE THE
###340 CONSUMERS AND THE PREDATORS, THAT IS ABOUT 10 PERCENT,
###344 AS WELL. SO, REMEMBER, PRIMARY PRODUCTION IS THE RATE
###347 OF ACCUMULATION OF BIOMASS BY PLANTS. SECONDARY
###350 PRODUCTION IS THE RATE OF ACCUMULATION OF BIOMASS BY
###352 CONSUMERS AND BY PREDATORS. SO, THIS 10 PERCENT
###358 TRANSFER IS ACTUALLY EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. FOR ONE
###361 THING, IT IS REAL. IT REALLY DOES HAVE ABOUT A 10
###365 PERCENT EFFICIENCY OF TRANSFER. AND WHAT IS
###367 INTERESTING ABOUT THIS IS, THIS WAS A VERY THEORETICAL
###369 IDEA THAT WAS DEVELOPED IN THE 30'S THAT THE
###373 LEVEL TO
###374 THE OTHER WAS ABOUT 10 PERCENT. AND IN THE 90'S THEY
###377 DID THESE WORLDWIDE FISHERY STUDIES WHERE THEY LOOKED
###380 AT AREA THAT HAD PRIMARY PRODUCERS, IN OTHER WORDS,
###383 DIATOMS AND ALGAE. AREAS THAT ARE PRIMARY CONSUMERS.
###386 FISH THAT WERE FEEDING ON THEM. AREAS THAT HAD
###388 PREDATORS. AND THEY FOUND THAT IT WAS INCREDIBLY
###391 CLOSE TO 10 PERCENT. MAYBE FROM AROUND 9 TO 11 IN THE
###395 SYSTEM'S THAT THEY LOOKED AT. SO, THIS IS REAL. AND
###397 SO THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS IS, IF YOU HAVE 100 OR SAY
###402 A THOUSAND POUNDS OF GRASS OR VEGETATION, YOU CAN
###407 PRODUCE ABOUT 100 PONDS OF PRIMARY CONSUMER AND YOU
###410 CAN PRODUCE ABOUT 10 POUNDS OF PREDATOR. OKAY? SO
###414 THERE IS THAT 10 PERCENT TRANSFER FROM ONE TROPHIC
###417 LEVEL TO THE OTHER. SO ABOUT A THOUSAND POUNDS OF
###419 PRIMARY PRODUCTION PRODUCES 100 POUNDS OF PRIMARY
###423 CONSUMER AND ABOUT 10 POUNDS OF SECONDARY CONSUMER.
###427 OKAY? SO THAT IS REALLY VERY, VERY INTERESTING THAT
###430 
###436 CYCLES, AND WE ARE REALLY TALKING ABOUT THINGS THAT
###438 INVOLVE OUR OWN BODIES. THESE ARE OUR OWN BODIES AS
###441 WELL. WE LOOK AT HOW THIS WORKS. SO, INITIALLY, WE
###446 HAVE AN ELEMENT, WHETHER IT BE CARBON, OXYGEN,
###450 NITROGEN, MOLYBDENUM, PHOSPHORUS. IT IS INCORPORATED
###454 FROM THE ATMOSPHERE IF IT IS ONE OF THE GASSES OR IT
###458 IS INCORPORATED FROM WEATHERED ROCK INTO PLANT BODIES.
###463 OKAY? FROM PLANT BODIES IT GOES TO ANIMAL BODIES AND
###467 THEN THROUGH FOOD WEBS. WE USED TO SAY A FOOD CHAIN,
###470 BUT ACTUALLY NOW WE THINK OF IT IN TERMS OF FOOD WEBS.
###473 WITH MUCH MORE COMPLEXITY AND MUCH DIFFERENT LEVELS.
###477 AND THEN OF COURSE, THESE ORGANISMS DIE AND THEN
###480 THROUGH DECOMPOSITION IT GOES BACK TO THE NON-LIVING
###483 WORLD. THE OLD DUST TO DUST IDEA. IT REALLY WORKS
###486 VERY, VERY WELL IN A WAY OF THINKING OF THIS, THIS
###489 IDEA. OKAY? SO, EVERYTHING WE HAVE HERE YOU
###493 PROBABLY KNOW ALREADY. LET'S LOOK AT A FEW OF THE
###496 
###501 IN OUR BODIES. ALL CARBON IN LIVING THINGS COMES
###505 THROUGH ONE DIRECT PATH. AND THAT IS A PATH THAT IS
###509 INVOLVES CARBON DIOXIDE FROM THE ATMOSPHERE. NOW, YOU
###513 KNOW THAT CARBON DIOXIDE IS ABOUT .03 PERCENT OF THE
###516 GASSES IN THE ATMOSPHERE. OKAY? WE KNOW THAT IT IS
###519 RISING AND IT CHANGES. BUT, IT TOOK, YOU KNOW ROUGHLY
###522 LET'S THINK OF IT THAT WAY. NOW, THE AUTOTROPHIC
###526 ORGANISMS AND WHAT ARE AUTOTROPHIC ORGANISMS?
###528 PLANTS. THAT IS WHEN WE SAY AUTOTROPHIC WE MEAN
###531 PLANTS. AUTO, SELF. TROPHIC, FEEDING. WHEN WE TALK
###536 ABOUT ANIMALS THAT EAT PLANTS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT
###539 HETEROTROPHIC. HETERO MEANS OTHER. TROPHIC MEANS
###542 FEEDING, OTHER FEEDING. SO WHAT WE HAVE IN THE CARBON
###545 DIOXIDE CYCLE IS THESE AUTOTROPHIC ORGANISMS. FIX
###548 ABOUT 10 PERCENT OF THE ATMOSPHERIC CO2 PER YEAR. YOU
###552 PROBABLY HAD ALL OF THIS IN HIGH SCHOOL. SO WE WILL
###555 GO OVER REASONABLY BRIEF. AND THEN THE HETEROTROPHS
###561 BY FEEDING
###561 ON THE AUTOTROPHS. BUT THE ONLY IMPLEMENTATION THAT
###563 THEY CAN GET CARBON IS FROM FEEDING ON THE AUTOTROPHS
###566 OR FROM, IF IT IS A SECONDARY CONSUMER, FEEDING ON THE
###570 PRIMARY CONSUMERS. NOW, OF COURSE, WE KNOW THAT
###573 BODIES WHETHER THEY BE PLANTS OR ANIMALS, DECOMPOSE
###577 AND THEY GO BACK TO THE ATMOSPHERE. THE BODIES
###580 DECOMPOSE AND THE CO2 GOES BACK TO THE ATMOSPHERE AND
###583 THEN IT GETS OR IT GETS REINCORPORATED INTO THE BODY
###587 OF HETEROTROPHS IF THE HETEROTROPHS ARE ACTUALLY DOING
###590 THE FEEDING. BUT EVENTUALLY ALL GOES BACK INTO THE
###593 ATMOSPHERE. THE AUTOTROPHS DIE FIRST IT GOES RIGHT
###595 BACK. IF THEY ARE EATEN BY THE HETEROTROPHS IT GOES
###599 BACK WHEN THE HETEROTROPHS DIE. IT ALL GOES BACK.
###601 THERE IS CYCLING. THERE IS CYCLING OF CARBON DIOXIDE
###604 THROUGH THE ATMOSPHERE. NOW, WE HAVE A COMPOUND THAT
###608 WE CALL CELLULOSE WHICH YOU KNOW FROM DR. FELDMAN.
###613 CELLULOSE IS A COMPOUND THAT BREAKS DOWN VERY, VERY
###617 
###620 THE SOIL. SO WE TALK ABOUT FOSSIL FUELS. FOSSIL
###624 FUELS BEING OIL, WHICH COMES FROM CELLULOSE OR FROM OR
###628 COAL WHICH COMES FROM CELLULOSE. THAT IS WHY WE TALK
###630 ABOUT THAT. SO, A LOT OF THE CARBON DIOXIDE THAT
###633 DOESN'T GO BACK TO THE ATMOSPHERE BECAUSE OF THIS SLOW
###636 BREAKDOWN OF PLANTS, OF SOME PLANTS ENDS UP BEING
###640 INCORPORATED AS FOSSIL, FOSSIL FUELS. AND OF COURSE,
###643 THE BURNING OF FOSSIL FUELS IS WHAT INCREASES THE
###646 AMOUNT OF CO2 IN THE ATMOSPHERE. NOW, A LOT OF CARBON
###652 IS ALSO STORED IN CORAL REEFS THAT TEND TO BE IN THE
###657 TROPICAL AREAS OF THE WORLD THAT IS FREE OF FRESH
###659 WATER, FREE OF SEDIMENTATION. AND THEY ARE
###664 INCORPORATED AS CALCIUM CARBONATE, AS CALCIUM
###668 CARBONATE. NOW, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS REALLY
###670 INTERESTING ABOUT CARBON DIOXIDE IN THE CYCLING, IS
###674 WHY AND A LOT OF IT TENDS TO REGULATE THE AMOUNT OF
###677 CARBON DIOXIDE, IS THAT THERE ARE TREMENDOUS SOURCES
###681 
###683 OKAY. THAT JUST HAPPEN. AND LARGELY FROM
###687 DECOMPOSITION OF PROCESSES OR FROM DIGESTION, FROM
###691 METABOLISM. AND ONE OF THE HUGE SOURCES, AND IT HAS
###695 BEEN ARGUED THAT IT IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST SOURCES IN
###696 THE WORLD, ARE TERMITES. TERMITES, NOW WE TEND TO
###701 THINK TERMITES AREN'T THAT BIG AN ISSUE HERE.
###704 ALTHOUGH, AFTER THE FIRST RAINS COME OFTEN TIMES YOU
###707 SEE THE TERMITES EMERGING FROM THE GROUND OR FROM
###710 HOPEFULLY NOT FROM YOUR HOUSE AND FLYING AROUND. BUT
###713 TERMITES, BECAUSE OF BACTERIA, SYMBIOTIC BACTERIA IN
###715 THEIR GUT CAN BREAK DOWN CELLULOSE AND THROUGH THEIR
###720 DIGESTION OR PARTIAL DIGESTION, THEY RELEASE CARBON
###725 DIOXIDE TO THE ATMOSPHERE. ONE OF THE BIG PROBLEMS,
###729 AND MAYBE IN SOME WAYS THE BIGGEST PROBLEM OF CUTTING
###732 DOWN RAIN FORESTS, BECAUSE TERMITES REALLY THRIVE IN
###735 THE TROPICS, IS THAT YOU LEAVE A LOT OF SLASH, YOU
###739 LEAVE A LOT OF MATERIAL ON THE BOTTOM. IT IS NOT, IT
###741 
###745 HAVE A HIGHER SURFACE TO VOLUME RATIO TO IS IDEAL FOOD
###749 FOR TERMITES. TERMITES TO PRODUCE EVEN MORE CARBON
###753 DIOXIDE. SO, ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE TALK ABOUT
###755 REGULATING INDUSTRIAL CARBON DIOXIDE IS BECAUSE YOU
###758 HAVE GOT HUGE SOURCES OF CARBON DIOXIDE LIKE TERMITES
###762 THAT YOU CAN'T REGULATE. THAT IS WHY THERE IS THE
###765 EMPHASIS. WE ARE NOT CERTAINLY, IT IS NOT THE,
###768 INDUSTRIAL CARBON DIOXIDE IS A PROCESSES ARE NOT THE
###771 ONLY SOURCE OF CARBON DIOXIDE, BUT IT IS THE ONE THAT
###773 IS MOST EASILY REGULATED. TERMITES ARE VIRTUALLY
###775 IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE THEY PROBABLY MAKE UP, TERMITES AND
###778 ANTS, PROBABLY MAKE UP THE LARGEST BIOMASS OF ANY
###781 ORGANISMS IN THE WORLD. IF YOU LUMP THEM TOGETHER
###784 BECAUSE THEY ARE JUST HUGE NUMBERS. ALL RIGHT. SO
###787 THAT IS CARBON DIOXIDE. NOW, NITROGEN IS A LITTLE
###792 MORE COMPLEX A TOPIC. NITROGEN IS A LITTLE MORE
###796 COMPLEX. I WILL SPEND A LITTLE MORE TIME GOING OVER
###798 
###802 PERCENT ATMOSPHERIC GASSES. THE PROBLEM IS, IS UNLIKE
###807 CARBON DIOXIDE, WHICH IS READILY USED IN THE
###810 PHOTOSYNTHETIC PROCESS WHERE PLANTS TAKE UP CARBON
###814 DIOXIDE INCORPORATE CARBOHYDRATES INTO THEIR BODY AND
###818 RELEASE OXYGEN. NITROGEN GAS CAN'T BE TAKEN UP BY
###821 PLANTS. NITROGEN CAN'T BE TAKEN UP BY PLANTS. THE
###825 FORMS OF NITROGEN THAT CAN BE TAKEN UP BY PLANTS ARE
###827 AMMONIUM AND H4 AND THAT IS NOT REALLY EASILY TAKEN UP
###832 BY PLANTS. THEY CAN TAKE IT UP BUT THEY DON'T TAKE IT
###834 UP VERY WELL. AND THE OTHER IS NITRATE. NITRATE NO
###839 3. WHAT HAS TO HAPPEN IS, THE ATMOSPHERIC NITROGEN
###843 HAS TO BE INCORPORATED INTO A AMMONIUM OR INTO NITRATE
###848 BEFORE PLANTS CAN USE IT. THIS IS REALLY A VERY, VERY
###852 IMPORTANT PROCESS. NOW, THE WAY THIS TENDS TO HAPPEN
###856 IS THAT THERE ARE ON EITHER FREE-LIVING IN THE SOIL OR
###861 ON THE ROOTS OF PLANTS SYMBIOTICALLY, THERE ARE
###865 BACTERIA THAT ACTUALLY ENABLE THIS TRANSFER OF FREE
###871 
###877 N03. THEY ARE ACTUALLY CRITICAL TO THE PROCESS OF
###881 PLANTS GETTING NITROGEN AS A NUTRIENT. THESE BACTERIA
###885 THAT PROCESS THE ATMOSPHERIC NITROGEN AND CONVERT IT
###890 IN TO FORMS THAT PLANTS CAN USE. THERE IS SOME MINOR
###893 SOURCES OF USEABLE NITRATE, IN THAT ABOUT 5 TO 10
###899 PERCENT OF THE NITROGEN THAT CAN BE USED BY PLANTS
###903 COMES THROUGH FROM THE ATMOSPHERE EITHER AS DISSOLVED
###907 IN RAIN WATER OR ADHERING TO DUST PARTICLES. SO THAT
###911 IS A SOURCE OF NITROGEN. BUT, NOWHERE NEAR AS
###915 IMPORTANT AS NITROGEN FIXATION. IN FERTILIZERS WE
###919 HAVE ACTUALLY THE INDUSTRIAL CREATION OF NITRATES.
###925 SOMETIMES AMMONIUM. BUT, THIS AGAIN IS A RELATIVELY
###929 SMALL PART COMPARED TO THE BACTERIA AND ITS ROLE IN,
###934 IN NITRIFICATION. NOW, DENITRIFICATION,
###938 NITRIFICATION. NOW, AS WE HAVE NITROGEN FIXATION
###942 GOING ON FROM FREE LIVING AND ON THE BACTERIAL PLANT,
###947 ON THE PLANT ROOTS BY BACTERIA, WE ALSO HAVE
###954 THE THINGS
###954 THAT IS VERY INTERESTING IS THAT WE GET A TREMENDOUS
###956 AMOUNT OF FROM DECOMPOSITION, THE REABSORPTION OF
###962 THESE NITROGENOUS COMPOUNDS THAT CAN BE USED BY
###965 PLANTS. WHETHER IT BE AMMONIUM OR NITRATE. SO THERE
###968 IS A LOT OF RECYCLING IN THIS SOIL. AND THIS REALLY
###971 WASN'T VERY WELL KNOWN UNTIL RECENTLY. AND THEN, WE
###974 HAVE A PROCESS, THIS IS A TERM THAT I JUST USED OF
###977 NITRIFICATION WHERE WE TAKE AMMONIUM, THE PARTICLE
###984 THAT IS NOT SUPER ABLE TO BE USED BY PLANTS INTO
###989 NITRITE, N02 AND INTO NITRATE, N03. YOU ARE ACTUALLY
###995 USING YOUR CHEM 1. AND, THEN, DENITRIFICATION IS THE
###1000 REVERSE OF THIS, WHERE WE GO FROM NO3 TO NO2 TO
###1003 AMMONIUM BACK TO ATMOSPHERIC NITROGEN. OKAY? SO, I
###1008 HAVE QUICKLY GONE OVER THESE CARBON DIOXIDE AND SPEND
###1013 A LITTLE MORE TIME ON NITROGEN. AND OF ALL OF THE
###1017 MINERAL ELEMENTS, I AM ONLY GOING TO GO OVER ONE
###1019 BECAUSE IT IS PROBABLY OF MOST IMPORTANT. AND THAT IS
###1022 
###1029 SIMPLE. A VERY SIMILAR TO ALL OF THE OTHER ELEMENTS
###1032 THAT WE GET FROM WEATHERED ROCKS, THE WAY THIS WORKS.
###1035 WHAT HAPPENS TO PHOSPHORUS IS THAT IT IS, IT IS ALL IN
###1039 A MINERAL FORM. THERE IS NO GASEOUS PHOSPHORUS OR NO
###1042 GASEOUS PHOSPHATE. IT IS ALL MINERAL. SO, IT TENDS,
###1046 BECAUSE OF THE WEATHERING, BECAUSE OF RAIN, IT TENDS
###1050 TO GET LEECHED OUT OF THE SOIL AND THEN CARRIED IN
###1054 WATER TO RIVERS. CARRIED IN WATER TO RIVERS. FROM
###1058 THE RIVERS IT FLOWS INTO THE OCEANS. AND, WHAT IT
###1062 DOES, IT TENDS TO SETTLE EITHER ON THE BOTTOM OR
###1066 THROUGH MIXING PROCESSES GETTING INCORPORATED INTO
###1069 PLANT BODIES AND THEN BEING EATEN BY FISH,
###1073 INVERTEBRATES WHO ARE THEN EATEN BY BIRDS. BUT IT IS
###1077 STILL, IT IS IN THIS MINERAL FORM. NOW, THE ONLY WAY
###1081 WE CAN GET IT BACK FROM THE OCEAN IS WE EITHER MINE
###1086 IT. SO, FOR EXAMPLE, FOR THOSE OF YOU FROM SAN
###1089 FRANCISCO, YOU GO OUT TO OCEAN BEACH AND YOU CAN SEE
###1091 
###1096 VERY OFTEN PEOPLE GO TO ISLANDS WHERE THERE IS A LOT
###1099 OF BIRDS AND THEY LITERALLY MINE THE PHOSPHATE FROM
###1103 THAT BECAUSE IT IS IN A FORM THAT CAN BE USED IN
###1107 AGRICULTURAL. OR THE ONLY OTHER WAY THAT IT CAN COME
###1110 BACK TO THE LAND, IS THAT IT COMES BACK BY LAND BEING
###1115 UPLIFTED. IN OTHER WORDS, SEA BOTTOM RISING TO THE
###1119 SURFACE. NOW, CALIFORNIA IS, THE COAST OF CALIFORNIA
###1125 IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY, IS UPLIFTED OCEAN BOTTOM. IS
###1129 UPLIFTED OCEAN BOTTOM. SO WE HAVE VERY HIGH
###1132 CONCENTRATIONS OF PHOSPHORUS HERE BECAUSE OF THE
###1137 UPLIFTING THAT OCCURRED IN GEOLOGIC TIME. BUT UNLESS
###1141 YOU HAVE THAT UPLIFTING YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH
###1144 PHOSPHORUS UNLESS YOU CAN GET IT FROM MINING SOURCES.
###1148 SO, IF YOU THINK BACK TO THE EXPERIMENT THAT I SHOWED
###1151 YOU WHERE THE LAKE WAS SPLIT IN HALF, AND THEY WERE
###1155 LOOKING AT THE EFFECT OF PHOSPHORUS ADDITION, THEY
###1157 ADDED PHOSPHORUS TO ONE SIDE OF THE LAKE AND NOT TO
###1161 
###1163 SIDE OF THE LAKE THEY ADDED PHOSPHORUS? IT TURNED
###1166 BRIGHT GREEN BECAUSE OF ALGAL BLOOMS. SO, THAT
###1170 EXPERIMENT WHERE THEY ADD PHOSPHORUS TO ONE SIDE AND
###1174 NOT TO THE OTHER AND YOU GET A RESPONSE OF ALGAE, IS
###1177 DEMONSTRATING THAT PHOSPHORUS IS A LIMITING FACTOR.
###1181 OKAY? THERE IS NOT ENOUGH PHOSPHORUS IN THE SYSTEM
###1184 SO AS SOON AS THEY ADD THE PHOSPHORUS IN, THEY GET
###1187 A WONDERFUL RESPONSE INDICATING THAT PHOSPHORUS IS THE
###1192 LIMITING FACTOR. OKAY. BEFORE I GO ON TO THE NEXT
###1195 TOPIC, I WANT TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS THIS.
###1198 OKAY? WE TALKED ABOUT ECOSYSTEMS, WE HAVE TALKED
###1202 ABOUT THE FLOW OF ENERGY IN THE CYCLING OF NUTRIENTS.
###1206 WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT ENERGY TRANSFER. WE HAVE TALKED
###1210 ABOUT CARBON DIOXIDE, WATER CYCLES, NITROGEN CYCLES,
###1213 PHOSPHORUS CYCLES. ANYBODY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR
###1216 ANYTHING THAT THEY WANT ME TO GO OVER?
###1226 IS THAT EQUAL? NO. NO. NO. TWO DIFFERENT
###1231 GOING TO
###1232 NITRITE GOING TO NITRATE. BECAUSE, NITRATE IS THE
###1234 FORM THAT IS MOST USEABLE BY PLANTS. THE OTHER
###1238 DIRECTION WOULD BE DENITRIFICATION. SO, IF YOU THINK,
###1245 DE, MEANS FROM. YOU ARE EITHER NITRIFYING OR
###1249 DENITRIFYING. THEY ARE GOING IN TWO OPPOSITE
###1251 DIRECTIONS. DO YOU HAVE A QUESTION? OKAY. ANYBODY
###1254 ELSE, YEAH? OH, OKAY. I WILL GO OVER THAT IN
###1263 A SECOND. MYCORRHIZAE. YES? PLANTS USE AMMONIUM
###1270 AND NITRATE BUT THEY USE NITRATE MUCH MORE
###1272 EFFICIENTLY. SO, IN FACT, FOR MAXIMUM PLANT GROWTH,
###1278 THE AMMONIUM HAS TO GO TO NITRATE, NITRITE AND
###1283 NITRATE. IT TAKES IT UP MUCH, MUCH MORE EASILY. I
###1289 HAVEN'T GONE OVER THAT YET. OKAY? I AM GOING OVER
###1291 THE CYCLES FIRST. OKAY. ANYTHING ELSE?
###1296 EVERYBODY GET THIS? YEAH? THE QUESTION IS,
###1305 WHERE DOES THE NITRIFICATION OCCUR? IT OCCURS
###1308 PRIMARILY THROUGH THE SOIL. THROUGH BACTERIA THAT ARE
###1312 
###1316 IT IS PART OF THAT SIMPLE BIOTIC BACTERIAL PROCESS.
###1318 IT IS PART, IT COULD BE CONSIDERED PART OF THE
###1323 FIXATION PROCESS, YEAH. WHERE YOU ARE TAKING
###1325 ATMOSPHERIC NITROGEN AND YOU ARE FIXING IT ALL OF THE
###1328 WAY TO NITRATE A FORM THAT CAN BE USED. OKAY. VERY
###1331 GOOD. NITRIFICATION. ANYTHING ELSE? ALL RIGHT.
###1336 THERE IS TWO OTHER TERMS THAT I MENTIONED. WHEN WE
###1340 THINK ABOUT THAT EXPERIMENT THAT WAS DONE, THAT
###1343 EXPERIMENT THAT WAS DONE WHERE THEY SPLIT THE LAKE IN
###1345 HALF AND THEY ADDED PHOSPHORUS TO THE OTHER HALF AND
###1347 THEY HAD THIS TREMENDOUS ALGAL BLOOM. IF YOU REMEMBER
###1351 PLANTS NOT ONLY PHOTOSYNTHESIZE, PRODUCE OXYGEN AND
###1355 GROW, BUT THEY CONSUME OXYGEN. IN THE EXAMPLE WHERE
###1361 WE SHOWED YOU OF THAT LAKE THAT WAS SPLIT IN HALF,
###1364 DURING THE DAY THOSE PLANTS WOULD BE PRODUCING OXYGEN.
###1370 BUT, AT NIGHT THEY WOULD BE USING IT UP. AND, WHAT WE
###1374 HAVE IS A TERM THAT IS CALLED, EUTROPHICATION AND IT
###1378 
###1382 BUT, WHAT THIS TERM MEANS IS THAT THERE IS SO MANY
###1385 NUTRIENTS THAT YOU END UP HAVING OFTEN TIMES
###1391 TREMENDOUS REDUCTIONS IN OXYGEN IN THE EVENING WHEN
###1395 RESPIRATION IS GOING ON BUT NO PRODUCTION OF
###1398 PHOTOSYNTHESIS IS GOING ON. AND WHEN WE TALK ON
###1401 MONDAY, I WILL ACTUALLY GIVE YOU A LITTLE MORE ABOUT
###1404 EUTROPHICATION. I WANTED TO MENTION IT NOW BECAUSE IT
###1407 IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT IN THE CREATION OF PROBLEMS IN
###1413 LAKES. AND NEXT WEEK'S LAB IS ENTIRELY ON WATER
###1417 POLLUTION. OKAY. NOW THERE ARE A COUPLE OF THINGS
###1419 THAT I ALSO WANTED TO GO BACK TOO. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT
###1423 THE WATER CYCLE, WE TALK ABOUT THE WATER CYCLE WE HAVE
###1427 POLLUTION PROBLEMS. AND NEXT WEEK'S LAB IS COMPLETELY
###1430 DEVOTED TO POLLUTION. SO I WILL TAKE THIS OFF AND
###1436 WHEN WE TALK ABOUT WATER IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO
###1439 REMEMBER THAT WATER AND THE WATER CYCLE IS INVOLVED
###1448 WITH SOMETHING THAT ARE CALLED AQUAFERS. NOW WHAT
###1452 
###1456 FROM BENEATH THE SURFACE, PEOPLE TEND TO THINK THAT
###1458 THERE IS LIKE A GIANT RESERVOIR OF WATER. LIKE A BIG,
###1462 JUST A, YOU KNOW, LIKE A BIG SWIMMING POOL. AND IN
###1465 FACT, THE WATER IS NOT LIKE THAT. THE WATER IS HELD
###1467 IN WHAT IS CALLED AQUAFERS. AND, WHAT AQUAFERS ARE,
###1471 ARE PERMEABLE. BUT THEY ARE COMPLETELY SATURATED WITH
###1475 WATER. UNDERGROUND LAYERS OF WATER, ROCK, SAND AND
###1478 GRAVEL. SO THE WATER ISN'T LIKE IN A BIG SWIMMING
###1482 POOL, IT IS SIMPLY TIED UP WITH THE SOIL THAT OCCURS
###1486 THERE. THE SOIL AND THE GRAVEL AND THE SAND THAT IS
###1489 IN THE AQUAFERS. AQUAFERS ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE 50
###1493 PERCENT OF THE DRINKING WATER IN THE US COMING FROM
###1496 THESE SOURCES. IT DOESN'T COME FROM RIVERS. IT
###1498 DOESN'T COME FROM LAKES. IT COMES FROM AQUAFERS.
###1503 AND, IT HAS BEEN ESTIMATED THAT ABOUT 2 TO 3 PERCENT
###1507 OF THE AQUAFERS ARE POLLUTED TO THE POINT THAT THEY
###1510 CAN'T BE USED ANY MORE. SO THIS IS A REAL POTENTIAL
###1512 
###1517 GETTING POLLUTED. THIS IS A PROBLEM FOR EXAMPLE IN
###1521 SILICON VALLEY. WHERE, BECAUSE OF THE MICROCHIP
###1524 INDUSTRY THERE IS A LOT OF POLLUTION WITH THE GROUND
###1526 WATER. BUT IN SILICON VALLEY WE DON'T USE GROUND
###1529 WATER FOR DRINKING WATER. THAT, OF COURSE, COMES FROM
###1532 OTHER SOURCES IN THE SIERRAS. NOW, I WANT TO TALK
###1535 ABOUT POINT VERSUS NON-POINT POLLUTION. BECAUSE AS I
###1539 SAY NEXT WEEK'S LAB IS ENTIRELY DEVOTED TO POLLUTION.
###1543 IF YOU HAVE A FACTORY AND THE FACTORY HAS A PIPE THAT
###1547 IS CARRYING CHEMICALS INTO A RIVER AND YOU CAN
###1551 IDENTIFY THE EXACT POINT OR THE SOURCE OF THAT
###1555 POLLUTANT WHERE IT IS FLOWING IN, SAY THE WATER IS
###1559 FLOWING THIS WAY, SO THAT ABOVE THE WATER IS CLEAN,
###1562 BELOW IT IS POLLUTED, YOU WOULD REFER TO THAT AS A
###1566 POINT SOURCE OF POLLUTION. IN OTHER WORDS, IT IS
###1569 IDENTIFIED EXACTLY WHERE THAT POLLUTION IS
###1573 CONSIDERING. ON THE OTHER HAND, IF YOU HAD SAY THIS
###1577 
###1579 MOST OF THE POINT SOURCES OF POLLUTION HAVE BEEN
###1581 ELIMINATED. SO THAT IS NOT REALLY A PROBLEM, BUT, YOU
###1585 HAVE GOT SAY A PARKING LOT UP HERE AND THE RUNOFF FROM
###1589 THAT PARKING LOT IS BRINGING OIL AND GREASE INTO THE
###1592 STREAM. AND MAYBE YOU HAVE GOT AN AGRICULTURAL FIELD
###1596 HERE AND THAT IS BRINGING SILT FROM EROSION INTO THE
###1601 STREAM. WE WOULD CALL THAT NON-POINT SOURCE. AND ALL
###1606 THE DIFFERENCE REALLY IS, IS WHETHER WE CAN IDENTIFY
###1610 EXACTLY WHERE THAT POLLUTION IS COMING IN OR IF IT IS
###1613 COMING IN FROM A VARIETY OF DISPERSED SOURCES. OKAY.
###1615 JUST COMMON SENSE. THINK OF WHAT THE WORDS MEAN. AS
###1619 I SAID IN NORTH AMERICA, IN MOST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES
###1622 OF THE WORLD, POINT SOURCE POLLUTION IS NOT A PROBLEM.
###1626 BUT, NON-POINT SOURCE POLLUTION IS A REALLY BIG,
###1629 A REALLY BIG PROBLEM. OKAY? ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT
###1634 POINT VERSUS NON-POINT? I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU
###1636 GET THAT DISTINCTION. OKAY. PRETTY OBVIOUS. THINK
###1640 
###1645 PHOSPHORUS CYCLE. BECAUSE THIS IS VERY, VERY
###1646 IMPORTANT IN AGRICULTURE IS THAT WE HAVE FUNGI THAT
###1654 ARE CALLED MYCORRHIZAE. M-Y-C-O-R-R-H-I-Z-A-E. JUST
###1657 LIKE WE HAVE SYMBIOTIC BACTERIA THAT HELP BRING
###1661 NITROGEN INTO FORMS THAT ARE USEABLE BY PLANTS, WE
###1665 HAVE MYCORRHIZAE THAT ARE SYMBIOTIC ASSOCIATIONS OF
###1669 PLANTS AND FUNGI. AND THEY ARE CRITICAL IN THE
###1673 ABSORPTION OF [INAUDIBLE]. NOW, AGRICULTURE IN OUR
###1677 FOOD REALLY IS REALLY, REALLY DEPENDENT ON THESE
###1679 PROCESSES. BOTH OF THE LEGUMES, THE PEAS AND THE
###1683 BEANS AND THE CORN AND EVERYTHING WE EAT DEPENDS ON
###1686 THESE BACTERIA CONVERTING NITROGEN INTO A FORM. AND A
###1691 LOT OF TREE GROWTH DEPENDS ON PHOSPHORUS. ENABLING
###1696 PHOSPHORUS TO BE IN A FORM THAT CAN BE ASSOCIATED WITH
###1699 PLANTS. AND THEN WE CAN GO BACK TO WATER. YOU KNOW,
###1702 ROUGHLY, IT TAKES ABOUT A THOUSAND KILOGRAMS OF WATER
###1707 TO RAISE OR PRODUCE ONE KILOGRAM OF AGRICULTURAL
###1715 OF
###1715 COURSE, SIMPLY LOOK AT THINGS LIKE, YOU KNOW, RICE
###1718 COMPARED TO POTATOES. RICE TAKES ABOUT YOU KNOW, TEN
###1722 TIMES AS MUCH AS POTATOES DO. BECAUSE, OF THE WAY
###1725 THAT IT IS GROWN. SO, THERE IS A LOT OF VARIATION.
###1728 BUT AS A RULE OF THUMB, WE SEE ABOUT A THOUSAND TO ONE
###1732 KILOGRAMS OF WATER TO PRODUCE ONE POUND OF PLANT. IN
###1737 CALIFORNIA, WHERE AS YOU KNOW, WE HAVE WATER SHORTAGES
###1740 MANY YEARS. ABOUT 80 PERCENT OF THE WATER GOES FOR
###1744 AGRICULTURAL USE. AGRICULTURAL USE. A LITTLE FOR
###1750 INDUSTRIAL, BUT ONLY ABOUT 10 PERCENT TENDS TO BE USED
###1752 DOMESTICALLY, MOST OF IT IS GOING IN TO AGRICULTURAL
###1756 PRODUCTION. YEAH? PLANT IN GENERAL. BECAUSE
###1761 REMEMBER, WHEN WE ARE GROWING AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS WE
###1763 ARE TENDING TO GROW AS MUCH EDIBLE PART AT POSSIBLE.
###1767 YEAH. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ONE POUND OF THE PLANT.
###1771 THE MAXIMUM PART OF THAT WE TRY TO HAVE AS EDIBLE.
###1775 OKAY, NOW, EVERYBODY PAY ATTENTION BECAUSE THIS IS
###1778 
###1788 EXPERIMENT. NOW, HOW DO YOU KNOW IF YOU WANT TO ADD
###1795 FERTILIZER TO YOUR LAWN OR YOU WANT TO REGULATE THE
###1801 AMOUNT OF PHOSPHORUS OR NITROGEN THAT IS GOING INTO
###1804 THE ENVIRONMENT, SUCH AS WE SAW WITH THAT WHOLE LAKE
###1811 MANIPULATION. AND WE WANT TO ASK WHETHER N OR P IS
###1815 THE LIMITING FACTOR. WHETHER N OR P IS THE LIMITING
###1824 FACTOR, WE CAN DO AN EXPERIMENT. AND, WHAT WE ARE
###1828 GOING TO DO IS SINCE WE HAVE USED NITROGEN PHOSPHORUS
###1831 IN THE LAKE EXAMPLE, WE ARE GOING TO USE AN AQUATIC
###1835 EXAMPLE AS WELL. SO, WE WANT TO SEE IF IN AN AQUATIC
###1839 ENVIRONMENT, LET'S JUST SAY, IT IS A STREAM THAT IS
###1842 FLOWING, WHICH ONE OF THESE TWO IS LIMITING? WE CAN
###1848 DO A VERY, VERY SIMPLE EXPERIMENT. WE CAN TAKE FLOWER
###1852 POTS, CLAY FLOWER POTS. AND WE CAN PUT 3 FLOWER POTS,
###1861 LET ME MAKE THAT THE SIDES A LITTLE SO THEY WILL LOOK
###1863 A LITTLE MORE LIKE FLOWER POTS, AND WE CAN PUT THEM
###1874 UNDER WATER. NOW, WE FILL THE FLOWER POTS UP WITH SAY
###1879 
###1886 NUTRIENTS IN. AND, IN ONE FLOWER POT TO THE AGAR, WE
###1893 ADD NITROGEN. TO THE OTHER FLOWER POT WE ADD
###1899 PHOSPHORUS. AND THEN WE LEAVE THEM UNDER WATER. WHAT
###1903 IS GOING TO HAPPEN, AND LISTEN TO THIS VERY CAREFULLY,
###1908 AND WE SEAL THE TOPS, LET'S ADD THAT, WE SEAL THE
###1911 TOPS. NONE OF THE MATERIAL CAN LEECH OUT OF THE
###1917 FLOWER POT THROUGH THE TOP. THE ONLY WAY IT CAN LEECH
###1920 OUT IS HERE THROUGH THE SIDES OF THE FLOWER POT
###1928 ITSELF. NOW, USING THIS EXPERIMENT, USING THIS
###1935 DESIGN, HOW COULD BE TELL WHETHER NITROGEN OR
###1941 PHOSPHORUS WAS THE LIMITING FACTOR? LET ME SAY IT
###1944 ONE MORE TIME. WE HAVE A FLOWER POT WITH NITROGEN
###1947 COMING OUT, ONLY NITROGEN. A FLOWER POT WITH ONLY
###1952 PHOSPHORUS COMING OUT. HOW WOULD WE DECIDE WHETHER N
###1956 OR P WAS THE LIMITING FACTOR? WHAT WOULD BE OUR
###1959 INDICATION AT THE END OF SAY A MONTH OF LEAVING THIS
###1962 IN THE WATER THAT ONE OF THESE WOULD BE A LIMITING
###1966 
###1969 THIS IS THE TYPE QUESTION I AM GOING TO BE ASKING YOU.
###1973 OKAY? 30 SECONDS. THINK OF THIS EXPERIMENT.
###1976 NITROGEN, NITROGEN IS LEECHING OUT OF ONE POT.
###1980 PHOSPHORUS IS LEECHING OUT OF ANOTHER POT. HOW WOULD
###1983 YOU TELL WHICH ONE IS LIMITING? REMEMBER, YOU HAVE
###1987 GOT A STREAM OF ALGAE GROWING IN IT. THERE IS ALWAYS
###1990 ALGAE IN STREAMS. DIATOMS. ALL UNDER WATER.
###2012 OKAY.
###2012 WHO HAS GOT AN IDEA? IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THE RIGHT
###2015 IDEA, WHO JUST HAS AN IDEA THAT WE CAN START TALKING
###2018 ABOUT IT? YOU TWO HAVE BEEN TALKING A LOT YOU MUST
###2020 HAVE A SUGGESTION? OKAY. WHAT HE JUST SAID IT,
###2031 WHICHEVER ONE HAS THE LOWER CONCENTRATION. THAT WOULD
###2035 JUST REFLECT THE LEECHING RATE OF COMING OUT.
###2039 WOULDN'T REALLY TELL YOU WHICH ONE WAS THE LIMITING
###2041 FACTOR. WHAT WOULD TELL YOU WHAT THE LIMITING FACTOR
###2044 WAS? HOW ABOUT YOU? WHAT DO YOU THINK? YEAH?
###2052 BUT, YOU ARE ON THE RIGHT TRACK. WHICH ONE IS, ARE
###2063 
###2072 SAY THIS REAL LOUD.
###2078 STUDENT: SO YOU LOOK AT THE ONE THAT DOESN'T
###2081 ANYTHING LEECHING OUT OF IT. BECAUSE THAT IS LIKE
###2083 YOUR CONTROL. YOU SEE WHAT IS GROWING ON THAT AND
###2086 YOU SEE THE ONE THAT'S ARE LEECHING MINERALS OUT
###2088 AND YOU SEE WHICH ONE HAS MORE STUFF GROWING ON IT.
###2092 PROFESSOR: WHAT KIND OF STUFF?
###2093 STUDENT: LIKE ALGAE.
###2094 PROFESSOR: GREAT. GREAT. THAT IS EXACTLY
###2096 RIGHT. NOW LET THE THINK ABOUT THIS EXPERIMENT.
###2098 YOU HAVE PHOSPHORUS LEECHING OUT AND YOU HAVE
###2102 NITROGEN LEECHING OUT. YOU LOOK AND SEE WHICH ONE
###2105 GIVES YOU THE BIGGEST PLANT RESPONSE, IN OTHER
###2108 WORDS, AS I SAID ALGAE IS ALWAYS GROWING IN THIS
###2110 SYSTEM. AND YOU LOOK AND SEE WHICH HAS THE LARGEST
###2115 AMOUNT OF ALGAL GROWTH. LARGEST AMOUNT OF ALGAL
###2118 GROWTH AND THAT WOULD BE THE ONE THAT WAS THE
###2120 
###2126 BUT WHAT IS THIS? WHAT WOULD WE CALL THIS POT
###2130 THAT HAS AGAR IN IT BUT NEITHER NITROGEN OR
###2135 PHOSPHORUS? CONTROL. WHAT KIND OF CONTROL WOULD
###2138 WE TALK ABOUT IT? NOT REALLY, A PROCEDURE WISE
###2142 CONTROL. WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THESE BEFORE.
###2144 A PROCEDURE WISE CONTROL. IN OTHER WORDS, YOU
###2146 WOULD WANT TO FIND IF THE POT BY ITSELF PRODUCED
###2153 ALGAE. OKAY? SO IT IS A PROCEDURE WISE CONTROL
###2156 TO SEE IF YOUR EXPERIMENT MAKES SENSE OR YOU HAVE
###2158 GOT SOMETHING THAT IS DOING THIS. NOW, LET'S SAY,
###2163 YOU HAVE GOT POTS FROM MEXICO. POTS MADE IN MEXICO
###2167 TEND TO HAVE VERY, VERY HIGH IRON CONTENT IN THEM.
###2171 AND, YOU DON'T KNOW IT WHEN YOU DO THIS, BUT IRON
###2174 WILL BIND TO PHOSPHORUS. SO, THAT IN FACT, THE
###2178 PHOSPHORUS, WHEN IT STARTS TO LEECH OUT OF THE POT
###2180 WILL BIND TO THE POT AND WON'T BE RELEASED. WHAT
###2183 WOULD YOU CALL THAT? WHAT WOULD YOU CALL THAT?
###2191 UNCONTROLLED VARIABLE. OKAY. YOU ARE ASSUMING
###2195 THAT THIS EVERYTHING IS OCCURRING THE SAME IN THIS
###2199 BUT IF THE IRON IS GOING TO LEECH TO THE
###2202 PHOSPHORUS, THEN THE PHOSPHORUS IS NOT GOING TO BE
###2204 RELEASED. IT IS AN UNCONTROLLED VARIABLE.
###2206 FINALLY, WHAT KIND OF, OF ALL OF THE EXPERIMENTS WE
###2209 DESCRIBED, WHAT TYPE OF EXPERIMENT WOULD YOU CALL
###2212 THIS? IS IT AN EXCLUSION EXPERIMENT? IS IT AN
###2219 EXPERIMENT? IS IT A CAGE EXPERIMENT?
###2226 SUPPLEMENTATION EXPERIMENT. WHAT WOULD YOU CALL
###2229 IT? WHAT IS IT MOST LIKE? PROBABLY LIKE
###2233 A SUPPLEMENTATION EXPERIMENT. BECAUSE YOU ARE
###2237 ADDING COMPOUNDS TO SEE IF YOU ARE RELEASING
###2240 COMPETITION OR YOU ARE GETTING A RESPONSE. VERY
###2245 GOOD. OKAY. NOW, YOU HAD A QUESTION?
###2261 OKAY.
###2262 GOOD, I AM GLAD. WHAT SHE JUST SAID. THERE IS
###2265 UNCONTROLLED VARIABLE. WHAT IF YOU PUT THE
###2270 FLOWING BY
###2270 AND IT GOT IT TO LEECH OUT FASTER THAN THE
###2272 PHOSPHORUS. GREAT. GOOD WAY TO THINK OF IT. YOU
###2275 ARE ALWAYS HAVE TO BE THINKING ABOUT UNCONTROLLED
###2278 VARIABLES. THAT IS A VERY GOOD EXAMPLE OF ONE.
###2280 OR, WHEN THE NITROGEN MAYBE WAS IN THE SHADE. AND
###2284 THE PHOSPHORUS WAS IN FULL SUN. OKAY? OKAY. SAY
###2293 THAT AGAIN?
###2293 STUDENT: WHEN YOU ARE CONDUCTION THE EXPERIMENT
###2296 HOW DO YOU KNOW WHICH, HOW MUCH TO PUT IN?
###2298 PROFESSOR: HOW DO YOU THINK YOU WOULD KNOW HOW
###2300 MUCH TO PUT IN? WHAT WOULD YOU DO TO DECIDE HOW
###2303 MUCH YOU WANT TO PUT IN? YOU WOULD CONDUCT WHAT?
###2305 WHAT WOULD YOU CONDUCT FIRST? A PILOT STUDY.
###2311 OKAY. THAT WAY YOU WOULD SEE IF YOU GOT ANY
###2313 RESPONSE AT ALL. YOU WOULD JUST CONDUCT A PILOT
###2317 STUDY. OKAY. GOOD. VERY GOOD QUESTIONS. ALL
###2319 RIGHT. ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT THIS? OKAY. WE ARE
###2323 
###2325 EARLIER LECTURES. WE ARE GOING TO LOOK AT HOW
###2333 SUCCESSION AND ECOSYSTEMS RELATE TO EACH OTHER.
###2338 NOW, LET'S LOOK AT THIS FIRST THING I HAVE WRITTEN
###2339 ON THE BOARD. AS ECOSYSTEMS MATURE, AS ECOSYSTEMS
###2344 GET OLDER, THERE IS AN INCREASE IN TOTAL BIOMASS
###2350 BUT A DECREASE IN NET PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY. THERE
###2355 IS AN INCREASE IN BIOMASS BUT A DECREASE IN NET
###2358 PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY. THINK OF WHEN YOU WENT TO
###2360 THE REDWOOD GROVE THIS WEEK. THOSE REDWOOD TREES
###2364 HAVE HUGE AMOUNTS OF BIOMASS. BUT, VERY, VERY LOW
###2368 RATES OF PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY. THEY ARE NOT, THE
###2370 RATE THE ACCUMULATION OF BIOMASS IS VERY SLOW
###2374 RELATIVE TO THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF BIOMASS THERE.
###2375 BECAUSE, THEY ARE NOT GROWING VERY FAST ANY MORE.
###2378 MOST OF THE GROWTH IS ALREADY IN NON-LIVING, IN
###2382 LIVING BIOPASS BUT IN NON-PHOTOSYNTHETIC BIOMASS,
###2386 THE REDWOOD TRUNK ITSELF. NOW, LET'S LOOK AT THE
###2390 
###2393 HAVE A LOT OF R SELECTED SPECIES WHERE EMPHASIS IS
###2396 ON GROWTH AND FAST REPRODUCTION AND GETTING NUMBERS
###2399 OUT THERE. EARLY SUCCESSIONAL STAGES ARE MORE
###2403 PRODUCTIVE THAN LATER SUCCESSIONAL STAGES. THESE
###2407 ARE RULES OF THUMB THAT WE SEE IN ECOSYSTEMS. AND
###2411 THE THIRD ONE IS DISTURBANCE FUNCTIONS TO KEEP
###2416 ECOSYSTEMS INTO EARLY SUCCESSIONAL STAGES AND
###2420 HIGHER PRODUCTIVITY. SO, WE HAVE ALREADY TALKED
###2423 ABOUT CLIMAX COMMUNITIES ACTUALLY NOT BEING VERY
###2426 REALISTIC UNLESS THEY ARE HIGHLY MANAGED SYSTEMS.
###2429 BECAUSE, WHAT YOU HAVE IS DISTURBANCES MAKING
###2433 THINGS GO BACK TO EARLY SUCCESSIONAL STAGES. OKAY.
###2437 NOW, THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT. WHAT
###2441 DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH HELICOPSYCHE? WITH THE
###2446 EXPERIMENTS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT HELICOPSYCHE,
###2447 BECAUSE THIS IS THE WRAP UP OF THE STORY, IN THE
###2451 EXPERIMENTS WE TALKED ABOUT WITH HELICOPSYCHE WE
###2454 
###2458 AND WE DEMONSTRATED THAT HELICOPSYCHE WAS IN FACT
###2463 WHEN IT WAS EXCLUDED, CAUSED THESE HUGE GROWTHS OF
###2467 ALGAE. BUT WHEN WE DID THE LIGHT BOX/DARK BOX
###2472 EXPERIMENT WHAT WE SHOWED WAS THAT THE EXCLUSION
###2479 PRODUCED LESS OXYGEN AND HAD LOWER PRIMARY
###2481 PRODUCTIVITY THAN THE GRAZED TILES. THE EXCLUSION
###2487 HAD FAR LOWER PRODUCTIVITY THAN THE GRAZED TILES.
###2490 HOW DO THESE 3 PRINCIPLES RELATE TO HELICOPSYCHE?
###2496 LET'S TAKE 30 SECONDS AND TALK TO EACH OTHER ABOUT
###2498 THIS. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT. TALK WITH EACH
###2524 OTHER.
###2534 OKAY. LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS. THIS IS AN
###2537 EXAMPLE WHERE WE ARE TALKING MATERIAL FROM ONE
###2540 TOPIC AND RELATING IT COMPLETELY TO MATERIAL WITH
###2543 ANOTHER TOPIC. WHAT DO YOU THINK? ANYBODY HAVE
###2545 ANY SUGGESTIONS THEY WANT TO MAKE? EMILY? OKAY.
###2555 GRAZING. WHAT SHE JUST SAID WAS, GRAZING BY
###2558 HELICOPSYCHE MOVES THOSE ALGAL COMMUNITIES BACK TO
###2563 
###2566 THEM AT AN EARLY SUCCESSIONAL STAGE BECAUSE IT IS
###2568 CONSTANTLY GRAZING. CONSTANTLY GRAZING. OKAY?
###2571 WHAT IS ANOTHER THING? BECAUSE IT IS AN EARLIER
###2581 SUCCESSIONAL STAGE IT IS KEEPING ALL THESE R
###2584 SELECTED SPECIES, IT'S MORE PRODUCTIVE. OKAY?
###2589 THE R SELECTED SPECIES, EMPHASIS ON GROWTH. WHAT
###2591 IS FUNNY? AM I MISSING SOMETHING. OH. KEEPING
###2595 THESE AT R SELECTED SPECIES WHICH ARE HIGHLY
###2600 PRODUCTIVE BECAUSE THEIR EMPHASIS IS ON GROWTH.
###2603 WHAT ELSE? ALGAE HAVE HIGHER PRODUCTIVITY IN
###2612 THESE EARLY GROWTH STAGES. WHEN THEY GET TO THAT
###2617 EXCLUSION TILE, WHICH REMEMBER LOOKED LIKE THIS,
###2621 REMEMBER, HERE IS THE GRAZED TILES. YOU COULDN'T
###2627 EVEN SEE ANYTHING GROWING ON THEM. IN THE
###2630 EXCLUSION TILES, REMEMBER, IT WAS FORESTS. IT WAS
###2635 VERY, VERY LOW PRODUCTIVITY. AND THE REASON IS
###2638 THIS, IS THAT REMEMBER, EVERYTHING BELOW THAT
###2647 A WAY,
###2648 THEY ARE LIKE REDWOOD TREES. IT IS MOSTLY STALKS
###2652 AND DEAD CELLS AND NON-GROWING CELLS. SO, IT IS
###2655 HIGH BIOMASS, BUT VERY, VERY LOW RATES OF
###2659 PRODUCTIVITY. OKAY? IN OTHER WORDS, IT WAS MORE
###2663 OF A MATURE ECOSYSTEM THAN OCCURS HERE WHERE
###2667 EVERYTHING IS UNDER R SELECTION. REMEMBER, THIS IS
###2670 WHERE THE EXCLUSION WORKED LIKE THAT. OKAY. THIS
###2674 IS A VERY, VERY IMPORTANT POINT. AGAIN, THE MOST
###2676 IMPORTANT POINT IS WE ARE INTEGRATING MATERIAL
###2679 ACROSS LECTURES. WHICH IS WHY WE TALKED IN THE
###2681 BEGINNING THAT THIS IS CONCEPTUAL MATERIAL. YOU
###2685 HAVE TO UNDERSTAND IT. YOU CAN'T, YOU CAN'T JUST
###2687 MEMORIZE IT. ANYBODY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS
###2689 OR ANYTHING YOU WANT ME TO GO OVER? I WANT TO
###2691 MAKE SURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THIS. PLEASE, IF YOU
###2694 HAVE GOT ANY QUESTIONS DON'T COME UP AFTER CLASS.
###2697 ASK IT NOW. I WOULD RATHER MAKE SURE WE UNDERSTAND
###2720 THE
###2720 EXCLUDED TILES, THE ONES THAT ARE ELEVATED, IT IS
###2724 NOT SO MUCH THAT THE MATERIAL IS DEAD, IT IS JUST
###2726 NON-PRODUCTIVE. IT IS NOT PHOTOSYNTHESIZING.
###2730 OKAY. IT IS STILL ALIVE BUT IT IS NOT PRODUCING
###2732 OXYGEN. IT IS BASICALLY USING UP OXYGEN. RIGHT.
###2739 IT IS LIKE THE REDWOODS. THINK OF THE TRUNK OF THE
###2742 REDWOODS NOT PRODUCING ANYTHING. IT IS THE LEAVES
###2744 THAT ARE ON TOP THAT ARE PRODUCING. SO THAT SECOND
###2747 POINT OF, HIGH BIOMASS. THE FIRST POINT AS THE
###2752 ECOSYSTEMS MATURE THIS RELATES VERY, VERY MUCH TO
###2756 WHAT YOU JUST SAID IS TO THE EXCLUSION, YOU HAVE
###2759 GOT HIGH BIOMASS, BUT LOW NET PRODUCTIVITY. OKAY.
###2763 THERE IS TWO OTHER COROLLARIES. NOSE THESE ARE
###2766 LESS RELATED, WELL THEY ARE RELATED TO SUCCESSION,
###2768 BUT LESS RELATES TO HELICOPSYCHE. MATURE
###2772 ECOSYSTEMS HAVE MORE SPECIES THAN EARLY STAGE
###2777 ECOSYSTEMS. BUT, THE INCREASE IS NOT AMONG
###2784 ORGANISMS. SO, PERDATION, PARASITISM, COMPETITION,
###2788 ALL OF THAT IS WHAT IS RESULTING IN THE INCREASE
###2792 SPECIES RICHNESS. IT IS AMONG HETEROTROPHS NOT
###2795 AMONG AUTOTROPHS. NOW, ONE OTHER THING, PLANTS AND
###2800 ANIMALS IN LATE SUCCESSIONAL STAGES TEND TO BE MORE
###2804 SPECIALIZED. SO MAYBE THEY ARE PARASITES ON
###2807 A CERTAIN SPECIES. OR MAYBE THEY ARE FEEDING ON
###2811 ONLY A CERTAIN COMPONENT OF THE ECOSYSTEM. IN A
###2816 WAY ALMOST LIKE COMPETITIVE EXCLUSION, WHICH
###2818 REMEMBER TAKES PLACE OVER A LONG PERIODS OF TIME.
###2821 SO THESE 5 RULES ABOUT ECOSYSTEMS ARE REALLY QUITE,
###2825 QUITE IMPORTANT. AND, OFTEN TIMES NARROWER. AND
###2833 AGAIN, THIS SHOULD ALL BE IN YOUR HANDOUTS. OKAY.
###2837 ANYTHING YOU WANT ME TO GO OVER WITH THIS BEFORE WE
###2839 GO TO ONE LAST TOPIC? YES? SO, IN THE FLOWER
###2845 POT EXPERIMENT. YEAH. THE ONE, OKAY, LET'S LOOK
###2853 AT THIS. WHAT WE HAVE DONE IS WE HAVE RELEASES
###2857 WE ARE
###2858 MEASURING THE RESPONSE BY LOOKING AT THE ALGAE THAT
###2860 IS GROWING ON THE OUTSIDE. THE ONE THAT HAS THE
###2863 MOST ALGAE GROWING WOULD INDICATE THAT THE
###2867 SUPPLEMENTATION OF SAY PHOSPHORUS IS WHAT WAS
###2871 NEEDED FOR THE ALGAE TO GROW. SO YOU KNOW THAT IS
###2874 THE LIMITING FACTOR. OKAY. LET'S DO IT AGAIN.
###2881 WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE IS THE ALGAE THAT IS GROWING,
###2884 BECAUSE IT IS BEING RESTRAINED FROM GROWING BECAUSE
###2888 THERE IS NOT ENOUGH OF THAT NUTRIENT THERE. SO,
###2890 WHEN THE NUTRIENT LEECHES OUT AND YOU GET ALGAL
###2893 RESPONSE YOU KNOW THAT IS THE LIMITING FACTOR.
###2898 OKAY? THERE IS NO PLANTS AT ALL. THERE IS NO
###2902 PLANTS AT ALL. IT IS A FLOWER POT, AND ACTUALLY
###2905 THIS EXPERIMENT WAS DONE, IT WAS DONE BY A GRADUATE
###2908 STUDENT IN COLORADO. SHE WENT ALL OVER THE UNITED
###2910 STATES PUTTING THESE FLOWER POTS IN. AND,
###2913 UNFORTUNATELY, SOMETIMES SHE BOUGHT THEM FROM
###2918 WHICH
###2918 SHE DIDN'T REALIZE SHE HAD THIS UNCONTROLLED
###2919 VARIABLE AND HAD TO GO BACK AND REPEAT A LOT OF
###2921 THEM. BUT IT WAS AN ACTUAL EXPERIMENT THAT WAS
###2924 DONE. ALL RIGHT. WE HAVE ABOUT 4 MINUTES. I WANT
###2926 TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE PRIBILOF ISLAND SEALS. WE
###2929 WANT TO WRAP THAT STORY UP TODAY. PRIBILOF ISLANDS
###2933 SEALS. WHAT IS, WHAT HAPPENS TO THE POPULATION IN
###2939 THAT PRIBILOF ISLAND STORY WHERE YOU HAVE GOT 10
###2942 THOUSAND BACHELOR MALES BEING HARVESTED EVERY YEAR.
###2945 THE POPULATION IS WELL OVER A MILLION. WHAT IS
###2948 GOING TO HAPPEN TO THE POPULATION? IS IT GOING TO
###2949 DECLINE DRASTICALLY? IS IT GOING TO STAY THE
###2952 SAME? IS IT GOING TO INCREASE? WHAT DO YOU
###2953 THINK? WHAT DO YOU THINK? YOU THINK IT WILL
###2958 DECLINE? WHAT DO YOU THINK? STAY THE SAME?
###2962 WHAT DO MOST OF YOU THINK IT WILL DO? DECLINE.
###2964 HOW MANY OF YOU THINK IT WILL DECLINE? REMEMBER,
###2969 MANY DO
###2969 YOU THINK IT WILL INCREASE? YOU HAVE NO OPINIONS.
###2972 COME ON. OKAY. ONE MORE TIME, HOW MANY OF YOU,
###2977 BECAUSE THIS IS THE TYPE OF STUFF YOU WILL BE
###2979 GETTING IN A VERY, VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME, HOW
###2981 MANY OF YOU THINK IF YOU TAKE 30 THOUSAND OUT OF
###2983 THE POPULATION IN A HAREM SYSTEM THAT ARE NOT
###2986 BREEDING, HOW MANY HAD YOU THINK THE POPULATION IS
###2988 GOING TO INCREASE IN NUMBERS? VERSUS HOW MANY OF
###2993 YOU DO YOU THINK IT WILL DECREASE IN NUMBERS?
###2995 WHAT ARE YOU SAYING, INCREASE OR DECREASE?
###2998 DECREASE. WHY? RIGHT. YOU GOT LIMITED NUMBER OF
###3003 MALES MATING. IT IS A HAREM SYSTEM SO YOU ARE
###3005 PULLING 30 THOUSAND OUT. BUT, IN FACT, ALL OF
###3008 THESE MALES ARE MATING AND THE FEMALES ARE
###3010 PRODUCING OFFSPRING. OKAY? GUYS, LET ME TELL
###3014 YOU. THIS IS THE TYPE THING THAT I AM EXPECTING
###3016 YOU TO KNOW. IT IS NOT GOING TO BE BIO1 A WHERE
###3019 
###3024 BACHELOR MALES ARE NOT MATING BUT THE MALES THAT
###3026 ARE IN THE HAREMS ARE MATING SO OFFSPRING ARE
###3029 CONSTANTLY BEING PRODUCED. OKAY. ANYTHING, YEAH?
###3036 YOU JUST KILLING THE BACHELOR MALES. REMEMBER THE
###3039 ASSIGNMENT WAS, LET'S END ON THIS NOTE, THE
###3041 ASSIGNMENT WAS FOR ALL OF YOU TO TALK TO PEOPLE IN
###3045 YOUR DORMS THAT WERE PERHAPS SCIENCE MAJORS BUT NOT
###3049 BIOLOGY BIOLOGISTS AND GO OVER THIS PROBLEM WITH
###3051 THEM. REMEMBER I ASKED YOU SEVERAL THINGS; WHAT IS
###3054 GOING TO HAPPEN TO THE POPULATION? WHAT WOULD
###3056 HAPPEN IF WE USED A DIFFERENT METHOD OF KILLING
###3058 THEM? WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF WE HAD DIFFERENT
###3063 ORGANISMS WE WERE KILLING? WHY WE WERE KILLING
###3065 THEM? OKAY? JUST ONE LAST THING. I AM NOT
###3069 GIVING YOU ASSIGNMENTS. JUST FOR MY OWN BENEFIT,
###3073 IT IS REALLY TO TRY TO HELP YOU GUYS THINK OF THIS.
###3076 SO HAVE A NICE WEEKEND AND I WILL SEE YOU MONDAY.
