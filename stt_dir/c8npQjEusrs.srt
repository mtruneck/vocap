4
0:0:7,4 --> 0:0:10,99
Ok this is Athena Jezik and we're
going to.. we're on the floor.


5
0:0:10,99 --> 0:0:15,659
working and we're going to work...


6
0:0:15,659 --> 0:0:21,22
we're going to work the back from the
floor.


7
0:0:21,22 --> 0:0:24,429
Kind of brushing her off right now. Just


8
0:0:24,429 --> 0:0:27,619
starting showing you some other things to do.


9
0:0:27,619 --> 0:0:31,329
Just kind of get the contact going.


10
0:0:31,329 --> 0:0:36,12
and of course when they're working the
back we're going to need to apply the oil.


11
0:0:36,12 --> 0:0:39,88
So, we're going to start by


12
0:0:39,88 --> 0:0:47,25
putting some oil on.


13
0:0:47,25 --> 0:0:52,79
Here on the back you want enough oil to


14
0:0:52,79 --> 0:0:55,48
be able to have a nice


15
0:0:55,48 --> 0:0:56,74
slide


16
0:0:56,74 --> 0:0:59,4
to your hands,


17
0:0:59,4 --> 0:1:1,36
but not too much


18
0:1:1,36 --> 0:1:3,51
you still want enough..


19
0:1:3,51 --> 0:1:7,26
enough mobility to work the muscle.


20
0:1:7,26 --> 0:1:12,229
And if you get too much of a slipperiness to it it's hard to maintain


21
0:1:12,229 --> 0:1:13,909
that part of it


22
0:1:13,909 --> 0:1:18,48
We're gonna go all the way down to the 


23
0:1:18,48 --> 0:1:20,88
to the hip


24
0:1:20,88 --> 0:1:23,19
area here where there's


25
0:1:23,19 --> 0:1:28,799
muscle attachments that come down from the
top and from the bottom up.


26
0:1:28,799 --> 0:1:35,93
This is quite a place of stability through here.


27
0:1:35,93 --> 0:1:37,4
It's been a 


28
0:1:37,4 --> 0:1:39,24
few weeks since I've


29
0:1:39,24 --> 0:1:44,15
worked her back so i can feel that
there's been some


30
0:1:44,15 --> 0:1:48,0
i guess from sitting room whatever it is
that she does carry there's a little


31
0:1:48,0 --> 0:1:49,71
bit of tension


32
0:1:49,71 --> 0:1:52,59
coming up through the back.


33
0:1:52,59 --> 0:1:55,65
Now, because of it being positioned on the
floor things change


34
0:1:55,65 --> 0:1:58,97
a little bit with the routine.


35
0:1:58,97 --> 0:2:2,6
So, normally I start at the head with myself being at the head, but instead I'm just


36
0:2:2,6 --> 0:2:3,93
gonna start


37
0:2:3,93 --> 0:2:5,95
up in this area and


38
0:2:5,95 --> 0:2:8,769
take my fingers on either side of the
vertebrae


39
0:2:8,769 --> 0:2:14,12
and work down.


40
0:2:14,12 --> 0:2:18,269
Ok, that way you could see where I am on
here,


41
0:2:18,269 --> 0:2:22,799
which is right next to the vertebrae


42
0:2:22,799 --> 0:2:24,849
working it downward...


43
0:2:24,849 --> 0:2:27,809
I'm doing two right close in


44
0:2:27,809 --> 0:2:30,889
and i'll tell you when you do this you
can feel


45
0:2:30,889 --> 0:2:31,919
a lot of what's going on


46
0:2:31,919 --> 0:2:34,69
down in the spine.


47
0:2:34,69 --> 0:2:37,609
We're not taking a whole lot of pressure
just enough pressure to where the


48
0:2:37,609 --> 0:2:39,969
muscle is letting you in and not enough


49
0:2:39,969 --> 0:2:41,629
pressure to where it's pushing


50
0:2:41,629 --> 0:2:43,109
back at you.


51
0:2:43,109 --> 0:2:48,429
Then you move a little farther away from
the spine


52
0:2:48,429 --> 0:2:51,609
and sometimes you'll see


53
0:2:51,609 --> 0:2:54,79
it's not a straight line.


54
0:2:54,79 --> 0:2:58,869
You have to go with where the tissue is. Always
follow the anatomy


55
0:2:58,869 --> 0:3:0,559
and then down


56
0:3:0,559 --> 0:3:4,599
on the edge


57
0:3:4,599 --> 0:3:8,349
there's a lot of different structures
that come into play so just


58
0:3:8,349 --> 0:3:10,529
keep on the focus


59
0:3:10,529 --> 0:3:15,249
when working the erector spinae.


60
0:3:15,249 --> 0:3:27,419
Ok, and then you can work it back up


61
0:3:27,419 --> 0:3:29,689
... the neck is turned


62
0:3:29,689 --> 0:3:32,15
so you can't really


63
0:3:32,15 --> 0:3:35,31
get a real good straight shot at that


64
0:3:35,31 --> 0:3:39,249
but if you're working a person from the floor you
can get that neck when you're doing neck 


65
0:3:39,249 --> 0:3:41,29
unwinding.


66
0:3:41,29 --> 0:3:44,229
You might want to wait until the end to do 


67
0:3:44,229 --> 0:3:48,259
that part, have them turn over last.


68
0:3:48,259 --> 0:3:52,309
And okay, now we're just going to start in with this 


69
0:3:52,309 --> 0:3:57,399
shoulder area.


70
0:3:57,399 --> 0:4:2,589
And if you're on the floor it's a little bit trickier.


71
0:4:2,589 --> 0:4:7,619
I'm gonna put one leg up...


72
0:4:7,619 --> 0:4:10,719
get a little bit better leverage.


73
0:4:10,719 --> 0:4:17,789
I'm leaning against my knee here.


74
0:4:17,789 --> 0:4:23,679
And here what I'm going along is the trapezius muscle. Just


75
0:4:23,679 --> 0:4:32,479
one little band at a time.


76
0:4:32,479 --> 0:4:35,569
And moving down, now the scapula,


77
0:4:35,569 --> 0:4:37,729
which is the shoulder blade


78
0:4:37,729 --> 0:4:40,139
is right here.


79
0:4:40,139 --> 0:4:42,9
Here's the scapula.


80
0:4:42,9 --> 0:4:44,58
So you're gonna hit a bony surface, so 


81
0:4:44,58 --> 0:4:47,219
i'd just work up to that surface and 


82
0:4:47,219 --> 0:4:49,47
take it right to the edge


83
0:4:49,47 --> 0:4:52,189
similar to


84
0:4:52,189 --> 0:4:54,78
how i did the clavicle.


85
0:4:54,78 --> 0:5:1,39
You're right on the edge of it, a little bit underneath... and following this 


86
0:5:1,39 --> 0:5:4,649
down the trapezius muscle coming to a point


87
0:5:4,649 --> 0:5:10,959
down here.


88
0:5:10,959 --> 0:5:14,689
Okay now starting at the point of the trapezius muscle,


89
0:5:14,689 --> 0:5:17,55
trapezius is 


90
0:5:17,55 --> 0:5:20,289
somewhat of a "V" shape and then


91
0:5:20,289 --> 0:5:25,35
up like a trapeze.


92
0:5:25,35 --> 0:5:26,99
And then


93
0:5:26,99 --> 0:5:28,93
pushing inward kind of


94
0:5:28,93 --> 0:5:31,19
stroking his toward the 


95
0:5:31,19 --> 0:5:32,9
vertebrae


96
0:5:32,9 --> 0:5:59,9
and there's a little bit of a circular motion, not much.


97
0:5:59,9 --> 0:6:2,119
Now, here I'm going along the 


98
0:6:2,119 --> 0:6:8,9
scapula. Let me see if I can get a better sort of vision for you.


99
0:6:8,9 --> 0:6:9,83
Here's the scapula


100
0:6:9,83 --> 0:6:10,65
right here


101
0:6:10,65 --> 0:6:16,179
you can go underneath it by picking
up the shoulder slightly


102
0:6:16,179 --> 0:6:17,78
working underneath it.


103
0:6:17,78 --> 0:6:20,819
If you feel a little snapping thing


104
0:6:20,819 --> 0:6:23,729
or crunchy kind of feelings


105
0:6:23,729 --> 0:6:26,909
that's been referred to as crepitus.


106
0:6:26,909 --> 0:6:29,979
I don't know if people really know what
crepitus is...


107
0:6:29,979 --> 0:6:34,289
It feels to me like it's just a really
tight tight area that's not getting a


108
0:6:34,289 --> 0:6:37,309
lot of fluid in it.


109
0:6:37,309 --> 0:6:38,929
And I have


110
0:6:38,929 --> 0:6:44,139
been able to see crepitus change.


111
0:6:44,139 --> 0:6:51,379
and then i'm going to be a flat on the scapula.


112
0:6:51,379 --> 0:6:54,62
And just working the muscle


113
0:6:54,62 --> 0:6:58,289
the weight of the muscle school you can
feel there kind of an upward


114
0:6:58,289 --> 0:7:0,789
and they curve into the


115
0:7:0,789 --> 0:7:2,409
arm socket.


116
0:7:2,409 --> 0:7:4,72
so it's really about


117
0:7:4,72 --> 0:7:8,659
knowing the anatomy and just following the anatomy


118
0:7:8,659 --> 0:7:12,12
and then knowing the pressure not to be too


119
0:7:12,12 --> 0:7:20,12
deep with the pressure and then along the side
here


120
0:7:20,12 --> 0:7:24,68
getting along side the scapula here... the scapula is here. Coming down you're working right up


121
0:7:24,68 --> 0:7:26,229
up


122
0:7:26,229 --> 0:7:29,38
alongside of it and kind of up under


123
0:7:29,38 --> 0:7:31,779
under it a little bit which can be


124
0:7:31,779 --> 0:7:33,77
lifted under here


125
0:7:33,77 --> 0:7:36,409
as well.


126
0:7:36,409 --> 0:7:39,26
Where there is a little bit of a scapula pick up here


127
0:7:39,26 --> 0:7:40,56
it's mostly


128
0:7:40,56 --> 0:7:42,229
muscle through here.


129
0:7:42,229 --> 0:7:44,77
Sometimes this is very ticklish


130
0:7:44,77 --> 0:7:46,819
for people, so


131
0:7:46,819 --> 0:7:48,559
you can usually get through


132
0:7:48,559 --> 0:7:49,99
tickling..


133
0:7:49,99 --> 0:7:51,8
ticklishness


134
0:7:51,8 --> 0:7:54,529
if you go slowly into it.


135
0:7:54,529 --> 0:7:59,3
And just work with it. Eventually, it won't have that tickly response.


136
0:7:59,3 --> 0:8:2,809
Now, working all the way down


137
0:8:2,809 --> 0:8:4,409
we're going to be doing upward


138
0:8:4,409 --> 0:8:5,529
movements


139
0:8:5,529 --> 0:8:9,5
along the hip.


140
0:8:9,5 --> 0:8:11,12
Thumb, one right after the other.


141
0:8:11,12 --> 0:8:14,9
It's moving ever so slightly


142
0:8:14,9 --> 0:8:18,849
until you're all the way to the edge.


143
0:8:18,849 --> 0:8:22,149
Running your thumbs down


144
0:8:22,149 --> 0:8:23,11
and then you can


145
0:8:23,11 --> 0:8:28,47
go up the vertebrae


146
0:8:28,47 --> 0:8:32,18
on one side.


147
0:8:32,18 --> 0:8:35,69
And again you can't get all the way to the 
head so just take it as far as you can.


148
0:8:35,69 --> 0:8:40,81
Lighten it up and kind of touch that area of the head.


149
0:8:40,81 --> 0:8:42,55
And then we're going to do the


150
0:8:42,55 --> 0:8:44,49
middle part of the


151
0:8:44,49 --> 0:8:48,94
long muscle,


152
0:8:48,94 --> 0:8:53,14
the erector spinae.


153
0:8:53,14 --> 0:8:56,32
It's the muscle that holds the spine up


154
0:8:56,32 --> 0:8:59,14
in an upright position.


155
0:8:59,14 --> 0:9:1,51
It holds the spine erect.


156
0:9:1,51 --> 0:9:5,48
It does need abdominal muscles to
support it properly


157
0:9:5,48 --> 0:9:10,7
which is why core exercising is
important.


158
0:9:10,7 --> 0:9:13,79
That's another reason why movement is so
important


159
0:9:13,79 --> 0:9:19,1
and the free flow movement from what
i have done is


160
0:9:19,1 --> 0:9:21,11
much more beneficial than


161
0:9:21,11 --> 0:9:25,84
rigid movement because sometimes you can
unwind yourself


162
0:9:25,84 --> 0:9:27,6
going through


163
0:9:27,6 --> 0:9:30,21
more of a free type of movement than


164
0:9:30,21 --> 0:9:31,65
something that's


165
0:9:31,65 --> 0:9:33,54
in a straight line,


166
0:9:33,54 --> 0:9:41,6
than the more linear type of movement. Now


167
0:9:41,6 --> 0:9:44,52
I'm doing a cross fiber friction up the 


168
0:9:44,52 --> 0:9:50,79
erector muscle and 


169
0:9:50,79 --> 0:9:54,11
kinda getting underneath it. You kind of slip your finger underneath it and 


170
0:9:54,11 --> 0:10:7,5
kind of stretch it to the side, kind of pull it aside. It feels real good to have that done.


171
0:10:7,5 --> 0:10:14,57
And up we go.


172
0:10:14,57 --> 0:10:17,34
Okay and then


173
0:10:17,34 --> 0:10:25,84
you can go to the other side


174
0:10:25,84 --> 0:10:29,43
...


175
0:10:29,43 --> 0:10:33,8
So, now on the second side I'm gonna just repeat it. I'm gonna go a little quicker at


176
0:10:33,8 --> 0:10:35,27
this.


177
0:10:35,27 --> 0:10:39,6
This stretching down. Remember we stretch down


178
0:10:39,6 --> 0:10:44,74
and I start at the vertebrae.


179
0:10:44,74 --> 0:10:48,43
Kind of follow the.. now here's the scapula.


180
0:10:48,43 --> 0:10:51,17
Let's show you the scapula again


181
0:10:51,17 --> 0:10:55,89
where we are.


182
0:10:55,89 --> 0:10:58,3
There is the scapula.


183
0:10:58,3 --> 0:11:0,85
right here it comes down to a little point.


184
0:11:0,85 --> 0:11:4,17
It actually lifted up quite a bit.


185
0:11:4,17 --> 0:11:7,14
And that's the scapula, so that's...


186
0:11:7,14 --> 0:11:10,56
Now, you can get under it and shake it. I didn't really do much of that


187
0:11:10,56 --> 0:11:12,73
on the other side, but


188
0:11:12,73 --> 0:11:15,2
if you have your one hand underneath


189
0:11:15,2 --> 0:11:16,93
and you're right on the shoulder


190
0:11:16,93 --> 0:11:22,69
uh... not the socket, but above the shoulder toward more mid-line of the shoulder and just


191
0:11:22,69 --> 0:11:27,22
rock it back and forth while you let your other hand slide up underneath


192
0:11:27,22 --> 0:11:29,68
in the sub-scapularis area


193
0:11:29,68 --> 0:11:33,98
you.. it's a very nice feeling to loosen up the scapulas that way.


194
0:11:33,98 --> 0:11:37,96
So that's.. I didn't show much on that side, but I'll show more on this side and of course you can  


195
0:11:37,96 --> 0:11:39,91
apply it on both sides.


196
0:11:39,91 --> 0:11:43,57
And then of course getting the muscles on top of the scapula


197
0:11:43,57 --> 0:11:46,44
working them a little bit more.


198
0:11:46,44 --> 0:11:49,85
You can work a little more petrissage, where you are


199
0:11:49,85 --> 0:11:52,23
really moving that around


200
0:11:52,23 --> 0:11:55,58
giving a little more range of motion to


201
0:11:55,58 --> 0:12:1,65
uh... the muscles.


202
0:12:1,65 --> 0:12:3,61
They don't really have range of motion but 


203
0:12:3,61 --> 0:12:10,4
they can move a little more on there when they are relaxed they can have a little more movement.


204
0:12:10,4 --> 0:12:11,68
Okay


205
0:12:11,68 --> 0:12:13,83
So then we can take it and bring


206
0:12:13,83 --> 0:12:19,33
ourselves back up through the


207
0:12:19,33 --> 0:12:24,88
trapezius muscle and this muscle is really.. on this side it's  much 


208
0:12:24,88 --> 0:12:25,829
much tighter


209
0:12:25,829 --> 0:12:30,8
than the other side and i know that's
because of


210
0:12:30,8 --> 0:12:34,59
different things that Corrina does


211
0:12:34,59 --> 0:12:37,71
with her arms and posture so if


212
0:12:37,71 --> 0:12:39,58
you are right dominant


213
0:12:39,58 --> 0:12:42,15
the muscular feeling


214
0:12:42,15 --> 0:12:45,86
much more work that the right side of her body takes on


215
0:12:45,86 --> 0:12:47,14
so the muscles are a little 


216
0:12:47,14 --> 0:12:50,23
more developed as well as a little bit
tighter


217
0:12:50,23 --> 0:12:54,3
you're never going to find true complete
symmetry in


218
0:12:54,3 --> 0:12:59,45
most people. You might find it in one or two but usually people do have a 


219
0:12:59,45 --> 0:13:4,9
lack of symmetry somewhere in the body.


220
0:13:4,9 --> 0:13:7,21
It's not a problem as long as it's not too 


221
0:13:7,21 --> 0:13:9,4
out of balance.


222
0:13:9,4 --> 0:13:14,1
You do want to try to keep both sides of your body


223
0:13:14,1 --> 0:13:18,74
as balanced as possible.


224
0:13:18,74 --> 0:13:25,46
And then we are done with the hip again. Working that.


225
0:13:25,46 --> 0:13:28,7
That's an important part to feel. Sometimes you will feel little bumpies 


226
0:13:28,7 --> 0:13:30,37
in there


227
0:13:30,37 --> 0:13:34,64
and just be gentle when you go over them and work on them


228
0:13:34,64 --> 0:13:38,6
don't put too much pressure. Don't try to beat them out just


229
0:13:38,6 --> 0:13:39,25
work them


230
0:13:39,25 --> 0:13:41,92
slowly,


231
0:13:41,92 --> 0:13:44,19
on winding them,


232
0:13:44,19 --> 0:13:47,8
spreading them


233
0:13:47,8 --> 0:13:48,25
kind of thing


234
0:13:48,25 --> 0:13:54,79
and then we just work up the back


235
0:13:54,79 --> 0:13:57,61
and up again.


236
0:13:57,61 --> 0:14:0,28
This is the same thing going up


237
0:14:0,28 --> 0:14:1,18
the muscle is a 


238
0:14:1,18 --> 0:14:4,89
strap of muscle so you just want to go to three different


239
0:14:4,89 --> 0:14:16,8
places on that muscle and another little


240
0:14:16,8 --> 0:14:19,79
thing you can do.. I'm not doing the exact same thing on each side. I'm getting some different


241
0:14:19,79 --> 0:14:21,2
ideas.


242
0:14:21,2 --> 0:14:24,3
It's very different working from the
floor


243
0:14:24,3 --> 0:14:25,96
than it is


244
0:14:25,96 --> 0:14:27,64
from the table.


245
0:14:27,64 --> 0:14:29,81
So, things change quite a bit.


246
0:14:29,81 --> 0:14:32,87
But you still do want to keep some kind of 


247
0:14:32,87 --> 0:14:36,88
symmetry of what you're doing so you're
covering the same things.


248
0:14:36,88 --> 0:14:41,97
In this video I'm just demonstrating
different things that you can do from the floor


249
0:14:41,97 --> 0:14:44,58
and working that up again through the 


250
0:14:44,58 --> 0:14:47,61
vertebrae.


251
0:14:47,61 --> 0:14:50,45
And then you can come back down the
vertebrae.


252
0:14:50,45 --> 0:14:53,44
umm...


253
0:14:53,44 --> 0:14:55,68
with your fingers on each side


254
0:14:55,68 --> 0:14:57,33
and doing a little 


255
0:14:57,33 --> 0:14:59,8
vertebral


256
0:14:59,8 --> 0:15:0,4
vibration


257
0:15:0,4 --> 0:15:4,4
which is very very nice.


258
0:15:4,4 --> 0:15:5,88
Takes a little 


259
0:15:5,88 --> 0:15:8,74
practice though for the therapist to do


260
0:15:8,74 --> 0:15:12,7
or the person working, so


261
0:15:12,7 --> 0:15:15,2
how I started was I would just put the other hand on top


262
0:15:15,2 --> 0:15:17,31
fingers on either side and just


263
0:15:17,31 --> 0:15:19,29
rock it back and forth


264
0:15:19,29 --> 0:15:21,59
to start with and then when you get 


265
0:15:21,59 --> 0:15:25,2
really you can also vibrate it down like this but that's a little


266
0:15:25,2 --> 0:15:28,34
harder


267
0:15:28,34 --> 0:15:31,56
to do. It takes a little bit more practice.


268
0:15:31,56 --> 0:15:34,69
That's a very nice one as well


269
0:15:34,69 --> 0:15:37,179
and then something that's real nice to end with


270
0:15:37,179 --> 0:15:40,47
is if you just place the palm of your hand


271
0:15:40,47 --> 0:15:44,53
across the spine and very slowly. You first...


272
0:15:44,53 --> 0:15:48,48
you just interface with it, so you feel like there is this interfacing


273
0:15:48,48 --> 0:15:51,11
and you will feel a bit of energy between
your hand


274
0:15:51,11 --> 0:15:53,209
and the vertebrae if you're not pushing


275
0:15:53,209 --> 0:15:54,67
too hard


276
0:15:54,67 --> 0:15:56,55
so if your on them


277
0:15:56,55 --> 0:16:0,259
even if your light just lighten it more, lighten it more


278
0:16:0,259 --> 0:16:1,99
lighten it more 


279
0:16:1,99 --> 0:16:3,89
so that you're


280
0:16:3,89 --> 0:16:7,25
feeling as if there's just a little tiny


281
0:16:7,25 --> 0:16:9,54
paper-thin


282
0:16:9,54 --> 0:16:11,42
area that you're touching the body
with


283
0:16:11,42 --> 0:16:14,8
and then very slowly move 


284
0:16:14,8 --> 0:16:16,8
the hand up.


285
0:16:16,8 --> 0:16:17,9
Now this


286
0:16:17,9 --> 0:16:20,72
really turns out to be a little more
energetic


287
0:16:20,72 --> 0:16:24,9
but oftentimes I feel


288
0:16:24,9 --> 0:16:28,56
people's muscles relaxing out from under
my hands when I go real slowly


289
0:16:28,56 --> 0:16:29,76
at this


290
0:16:29,76 --> 0:16:34,7
there's something about this particular
thing that relaxes the muscles in a way


291
0:16:34,7 --> 0:16:37,17
that i feel a tremendous amount of work


292
0:16:37,17 --> 0:16:39,18
coming out of a lot of


293
0:16:39,18 --> 0:16:40,14
backs


294
0:16:40,14 --> 0:16:41,1
as they're


295
0:16:41,1 --> 0:16:42,65
relaxing more


296
0:16:42,65 --> 0:16:44,18
just like coming up 


297
0:16:44,18 --> 0:16:46,49
this uh... spine


298
0:16:46,49 --> 0:16:48,29
very lightly 


299
0:16:48,29 --> 0:16:50,45
and more of an energetic kind of


300
0:16:50,45 --> 0:16:52,57
move.


301
0:16:52,57 --> 0:16:56,24
And you just take that all the way up


302
0:16:56,24 --> 0:17:0,34
very slowly


303
0:17:0,34 --> 0:17:11,58
And you can do this once or twice, I usually try to do things in threes and


304
0:17:11,58 --> 0:17:13,13
then at the neck you''ll just


305
0:17:13,13 --> 0:17:15,24
take your thumb around and


306
0:17:15,24 --> 0:17:18,689
just complete it out, now because the neck is turned sideways


307
0:17:18,689 --> 0:17:21,5
and because of the nature of this being
more energetic I'm


308
0:17:21,5 --> 0:17:24,82
flattening the palm


309
0:17:24,82 --> 0:17:27,0
and just completing it more energetically


310
0:17:27,0 --> 0:17:29,429
up through the base of the skull


311
0:17:29,429 --> 0:17:31,54
and then letting it come off.


312
0:17:31,54 --> 0:17:34,24
And then you can go up just regular.


313
0:17:34,24 --> 0:17:37,5
But that's a very very very nice


314
0:17:37,5 --> 0:17:40,19
thing to do and then you can just wrap


315
0:17:40,19 --> 0:17:42,61
the body


316
0:17:42,61 --> 0:17:47,65
and we'll wrap it from this side and then pulling it down 


317
0:17:47,65 --> 0:17:49,71
stretching it that way.


318
0:17:49,71 --> 0:17:51,69
Okay


319
0:17:51,69 --> 0:17:53,2
there we have it.


320
0:17:53,2 --> 0:17:57,13
A few more ideas for you if you are working from the floor. Thank you so much this is 


321
0:17:57,13 --> 0:18:8,7
Athena Jezik.


322
0:18:8,7 --> 0:18:35,72



323
0:18:35,72 --> 0:18:48,559



324
0:18:48,559 --> 0:20:48,559
