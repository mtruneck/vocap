0:0:13,74 --> 0:0:17,449
Alright Mustang fans, you know what day it
is! It's December 5th, 2013. The big reveal


2
0:0:17,449 --> 0:0:21,48
of the next generation Ford Mustang is finally
here and we're right here in New York City


3
0:0:21,48 --> 0:0:25,49
to bring it to you guys. We're starting things
off right here at Good Morning America. The


4
0:0:25,49 --> 0:0:30,5
reveal is happening worldwide. Keep in mind
that this is the first worldwide Mustang.


5
0:0:30,5 --> 0:0:35,1
Shanghai, Barcelona, Sydney, LA, Dearborn
Michigan and of course right here in New York


6
0:0:35,1 --> 0:0:38,6
City. Now this whole day is full of Mustangs.
We're going to be here for the reveal, first.


7
0:0:38,6 --> 0:0:42,33
Then we're going to go to a press conference
where we're going to learn more about the


8
0:0:42,33 --> 0:0:46,58
2015 and of course we're going to be bringing
you guys with us every step of the way. You


9
0:0:46,58 --> 0:0:50,659
should know the deal by now you have to subscribe
to our YouTube channel if you haven't already


10
0:0:50,659 --> 0:0:54,799
to keep tabs on all of these great videos
including the new 2015 Mustang! I'm excited


11
0:0:54,799 --> 0:1:1,86
to see the car, I know you guys are as well
so let's check it out. Well, here it is guys


12
0:1:1,86 --> 0:1:8,479
for the first time, nationally televised the
2015 Mustang. I have to admit... absolutely


13
0:1:8,479 --> 0:1:12,299
stunning in person. Now, you guys can see
the thing looks pretty sharp. It definitely


14
0:1:12,299 --> 0:1:18,53
looks a little smaller than the 2013 and 2014's
in my opinion, but overall impression, man...


15
0:1:18,53 --> 0:1:25,53
very nice! And of course for Mustang fans
in North America it's very exciting. Alot


16
0:1:25,53 --> 0:1:29,539
of new things to expect, new technology, new
suspension, so it's a very exciting time to


17
0:1:29,539 --> 0:1:37,479
be a Mustang fan. Alright guys, love it or
hate it the next generation Mustang is here


18
0:1:37,479 --> 0:1:40,229
and I think it's a beaut man. It really does
look sharp in person, but this is only the


19
0:1:40,229 --> 0:1:46,3
tip of the iceburg. We're on our way to our
next stop which is an invite-only Ford press


20
0:1:46,3 --> 0:1:49,53
conference. They're actually going to have
a Mustang GT there from what we understand,


21
0:1:49,53 --> 0:2:3,0
so I'm excited to see that! Let's go check
it out. What I want to do now is give you


22
0:2:3,0 --> 0:2:8,229
an idea of how much change we actually made
if we actually pull the images up on the screen.


23
0:2:8,229 --> 0:2:12,88
That's the 2014 Mustang compared to the 2015
and what you're hopefully going to see there


24
0:2:12,88 --> 0:2:17,95
is how much lower and wider that the 2015
really is. We have now a 2.3L Ecoboost that


25
0:2:17,95 --> 0:2:23,24
we're bringing into the Mustang. The Ecoboost
will put out more power and torque than the


26
0:2:23,24 --> 0:2:28,0
V6 and yet it's going to be significantly
more fuel efficient. Our 5.0L is going to


27
0:2:28,0 --> 0:2:31,0
undergo some overhaul and it's going to get
more horsepower and it will also be more fuel


28
0:2:31,0 --> 0:2:36,0
efficient. What are we doing to the paddle
shifters? We're rev-matching in the downshifts


29
0:2:36,0 --> 0:2:39,0
and when you take the car and put it into
drive from Sport-Mode and then you use the


30
0:2:39,0 --> 0:2:42,0
paddle shifters, you're going to get quicker
and more aggressive shifts. We did put an


31
0:2:42,0 --> 0:2:46,0
IRS in the vehicle, I know everybody has been
wondering. It has an IRS. It's a world-class


32
0:2:46,0 --> 0:2:49,47
integral link suspension. So, we ended up
doing an all new front suspension, as well.


33
0:2:49,47 --> 0:2:55,19
So we have the double ball-joint front suspension
with a full subframe, more than 20 new technologies


34
0:2:55,19 --> 0:2:59,41
built into the car. When you get in it, you're
going to push a button to start your driving


35
0:2:59,41 --> 0:3:3,27
experience. After that you have toggles to
mess with. One of those toggles is going to


36
0:3:3,27 --> 0:3:8,84
feature a selectable driving mode. It will
toggle between Normal, Sport, Track and Snow/Wet


37
0:3:8,84 --> 0:3:14,0
mode. So right next to that toggle switch
we have some additional toggle switches that


38
0:3:14,0 --> 0:3:17,5
will allow you to override those settings
so that you can customize your own steering


39
0:3:17,5 --> 0:3:20,0
settings if you don't like the ones that we've
chosen for you or you'll be able to modify


40
0:3:20,0 --> 0:3:24,0
the electronic stability control, the traction
control. So all of this comes together to


41
0:3:24,0 --> 0:3:31,0
provide you a vehicle that is a much more
capable and easier to drive than any Mustang we've


42
0:3:31,0 --> 0:3:35,68
ever produced. Alright guys, we just wrapped
up the press briefing here at the 2015 Mustang


43
0:3:35,68 --> 0:3:39,26
reveal. We got to hear from all of the brilliant
minds that went into making this incredible


44
0:3:39,26 --> 0:3:42,99
machine and let me just tell you there's alot
more going on than I originally thought. I


45
0:3:42,99 --> 0:3:48,32
mean, this car just leaps and bounds above
the 2013 and 2014 Mustangs in just about every


46
0:3:48,32 --> 0:3:53,6
way. Most powerful Mustang lineup of all-time
with the Ecoboost motor, the V6 and the pumped-up


47
0:3:53,6 --> 0:3:57,79
Coyote 5.0L motor. Most capable handling Mustang
of all-time with the new independent rear


48
0:3:57,79 --> 0:4:3,94
suspension set up going on. Let's hop inside
real quick and take a look. Just totally redesigned


49
0:4:3,94 --> 0:4:7,43
interior. Just feels more modern and I think
that's what they're going for overall with


50
0:4:7,43 --> 0:4:11,57
the 2015. It's just pushing the car forward
and getting out of that retro styling which


51
0:4:11,57 --> 0:4:15,59
they've been doing since 2005. Don't get me
wrong, I love it. But, in Ford's opinion,


52
0:4:15,59 --> 0:4:20,539
it was time to move the car forward and they've
done a great job with it. It's jut a much


53
0:4:20,539 --> 0:4:24,9
better Mustang, that's the only way I can
put it. I was a little apprehensive like you


54
0:4:24,9 --> 0:4:29,38
guys all were online. We all saw the renderings,
we all saw the early leaked photos, but seeing


55
0:4:29,38 --> 0:4:33,86
it here in person it's the only way to appreciate
this car and I can't stress that enough guys.


56
0:4:33,86 --> 0:4:37,729
You really have to check this thing out in
person and make your own final judgement.


57
0:4:37,729 --> 0:4:41,43
Alright, here with Dave, Chief Engineer of
the new Mustang. How you doing, sir? Dave:


58
0:4:41,43 --> 0:4:45,6
Good man, how are you? Justin: I am great.
The car is amazing man, well done. Dave: Thank


59
0:4:45,6 --> 0:4:48,349
you! Justin: Now some Boss 302 internals we're
hearing about. Can you be a little bit more


60
0:4:48,349 --> 0:4:51,719
specific about that? Where are you getting
the extra power from? Dave: Yeah, so a couple


61
0:4:51,719 --> 0:4:53,93
things. We learned alot from the Boss 302
in how to make the engine breathe better.


62
0:4:53,93 --> 0:4:57,419
So, we have larger intake and exhaust valves,
we've got a revised camshaft lifting those


63
0:4:57,419 --> 0:5:1,87
valves higher. We have new heads to support
the flow alot better and then we're using


64
0:5:1,87 --> 0:5:5,889
the valve springs out of the Boss. We're using
the forged connecting rods. Justin: Maybe


65
0:5:5,889 --> 0:5:8,759
a little higher revving enginng? Dave: It's
not going to rev any higher as far as the


66
0:5:8,759 --> 0:5:12,599
redline goes, but you are going to get more
horsepower out of it and more torque. Justin:


67
0:5:12,599 --> 0:5:15,689
Any numbers you can give us right now? Dave:
We're not sharing numbers now, but you've


68
0:5:15,689 --> 0:5:19,529
seen us that the 5.0L from 412 horsepower
to 420 horsepower and we're going to take


69
0:5:19,529 --> 0:5:21,99
yet another step forward and we're going to
make everybody happy. Justin: The Ecoboost


70
0:5:21,99 --> 0:5:25,59
is making its introduction into the Mustang
for the first time. Tell us a little more


71
0:5:25,59 --> 0:5:28,84
about your experience with that? Dave: So
the Ecoboost technology has been phenomenal


72
0:5:28,84 --> 0:5:32,849
right? Now for the first time we're adding
a new Ecoboost, a 2.3L to the family, specifically


73
0:5:32,849 --> 0:5:35,99
designed to be in this machine. I've been
out on the track with it, I've flogged it


74
0:5:35,99 --> 0:5:40,15
and I'm telling you it'll put a smile on your
face. It is absolutely worthy of being in


75
0:5:40,15 --> 0:5:44,919
that car. Justin: So, killer gas mileage,
over 300 horsepower... I mean, I'm a V8 guy


76
0:5:44,919 --> 0:5:48,24
through and through, but it's kind of hard
to beat those kind of numbers. Dave: I will


77
0:5:48,24 --> 0:5:52,129
tell you that you will definitely enjoy it.
I'll tell you that! Justin: We're here with


78
0:5:52,129 --> 0:5:56,33
Moray, Executive Design Director. First off
sir, I just want to say congratulations. You


79
0:5:56,33 --> 0:5:58,919
can finally take a breathe right? Moray: Thanks!
I know, right? Justin: Let's talk about probably


80
0:5:58,919 --> 0:6:2,219
one of the most changed areas, the rear end
Morray, what are you thinking about the rear


81
0:6:2,219 --> 0:6:5,68
end? Moray: Well, I think one of the, you
know, one of the things that's very important


82
0:6:5,68 --> 0:6:9,84
is the tri-bar tail lamps. It's very important
to keep that, but we wanted to do them in


83
0:6:9,84 --> 0:6:14,699
a much more exciting and modern way. So, we've
really used new LED technology not even just


84
0:6:14,699 --> 0:6:19,8
to give the cars a beautiful lit appearance,
but the unlit appearance with so much 3-dimensionality


85
0:6:19,8 --> 0:6:23,809
to the actual forms, as well. So, although
it's the formula of Mustang, its done in a


86
0:6:23,809 --> 0:6:28,409
very much more modern way. Justin: Well Moray,
that classic kind of icon happens up front,


87
0:6:28,409 --> 0:6:32,969
too with the gills from the 1964 and 1965
Mustang, so... Moray: Yeah, some people recognize


88
0:6:32,969 --> 0:6:37,229
that. We've paid homage to the first car with
the gills and we turned those into daylight


89
0:6:37,229 --> 0:6:41,8
running lamps. There's nothing subtle about
"Mustang". It needs to be this fist where


90
0:6:41,8 --> 0:6:43,699
you, you know, you want to see it in the mirror
coming behind you and be able to recognize


91
0:6:43,699 --> 0:6:51,529
what it is. Justin: Alright, we're here at
the Ford after-party. Obviously, it's been


92
0:6:51,529 --> 0:6:56,469
a long day. We've been up since 4AM. Now it's
time to blow off a little steam, but not just


93
0:6:56,469 --> 0:7:2,809
a good time. I mean, we're actually checking
out the Good Morning America fastback 2.3L


94
0:7:2,809 --> 0:7:7,689
Ecoboost 2015 Mustang here. Very cool stuff,
you actually get a good feel of the fastback


95
0:7:7,689 --> 0:7:13,849
right here. You can see the angle, see the
very cool rear end and again 2.3L 4-cylinder


96
0:7:13,849 --> 0:7:18,979
motor, great fuel mileage but guess what?
Over 300 horsepower, so... this thing should


97
0:7:18,979 --> 0:7:24,909
be pretty nasty. Well guys, that's going to
wrap us up here for the 2015 Mustang unveiling


98
0:7:24,909 --> 0:7:28,999
live from New York City. It's been one heck
of a day, we saw Good Morning America, the


99
0:7:28,999 --> 0:7:33,439
press briefing and now the after-party where
everybody's blowing off a little steam and


100
0:7:33,439 --> 0:7:37,39
we're getting to check out both cars here
in the flesh. I'll be the first to tell you,


101
0:7:37,39 --> 0:7:41,18
I was skeptical on how this car was going
to look after seeing the renderings, seeing


102
0:7:41,18 --> 0:7:48,8
the spy photos, but again seeing it here in-person,
the car just looks amazing and it's just leaps


103
0:7:48,8 --> 0:7:52,939
and bounds over the S197 in many different
ways. I encourage you guys to give it a chance


104
0:7:52,939 --> 0:7:56,58
before rushing to judgement. We cannot wait
to give this thing a chance and get behind


105
0:7:56,58 --> 0:8:0,55
the wheel, get our hands on it, go crazy,
make it our next Project Car when it does


106
0:8:0,55 --> 0:8:3,939
launch and you know we'll be all over that!
You guys have to stay up-to-date with our
