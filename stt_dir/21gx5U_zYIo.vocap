###14 DAVID CHOE: Day 14 on "Thumbs Up," our
###18 cross-country adventure.
###20 We're in the Big Easy.
###21 We're in New Orleans.
###22 Caught a ride late last night out of
###24 Lake Providence, Louisiana.
###26 We want to just--
###27 I guess it's exactly one year after Katrina.
###31 I'm sure you see this shit on the news all the time, but I
###33 want to see it for myself, so we're going to walk over
###36 there, check it out, and try to find a decent bowl of gumbo
###40 and then get the fuck out of Dodge.
###42 
###47 All right, we're here with Thomas.
###49 THOMAS KING: King.
###50 DAVID CHOE: Thomas King?
###51 He's from, uh-- where you from?
###53 THOMAS KING: New Orleans.
###53 I'm on Ninth Ward.
###54 DAVID CHOE: Let's see.
###56 Ninth Ward.
###60 We're--
###61 we're about to head over that way just to check it out.
###63 You think two Asian guys will be all right walking around
###65 the Ninth Ward?
###67 Yeah,
###67 THOMAS KING: Yeah, man.
###68 I mean, y'all would be straight.
###69 All y'all gotta do is, you know what I'm saying, keep
###71 your head up and look for, you know, you gotta keep your eyes
###73 open, you know what I'm saying? 'Cause ain't no
###75 telling what might happen, you know what I'm saying?
###77 Right now, like I said, it's hot and
###78 everybody wants something.
###80 Everybody hungry, ain't got no money, they hurting out here.
###82 And they'll jack you quick, so you just got to be careful.
###85 You know, just watch yourself.
###87 DAVID CHOE: All right.
###87 Hey, thank you so much for talking with us.
###89 THOMAS KING: Oh, for sure.
###91 Y'all be cool.
###92 DAVID CHOE: All right.
###92 Thanks.
###94 
###111 So this is where the levee broke, and then all these
###115 houses got blasted.
###117 But I guess they fixed it now.
###119 
###142 Everyone wants to come out to New Orleans to party.
###146 And it's just sad.
###148 Talked to a fellow today in the restroom while I was in
###152 the bathroom, and he said the heart and soul of the city's
###157 gone, and it'll never come back.
###159 And now all the scavengers and pirates and--
###166 it's the Wild West out here.
###169 I can't believe this is America.
###170 
###185 Hi, David.
###186 TIARA: Hi, Tiara.
###187 DAVID CHOE: Tiara?
###188 We're just traveling cross-country, and we just got
###190 to New Orleans today.
###192 And I mean, I mean, I'm pretty much--
###196 I don't know what to say.
###197 I can't believe it.
###200 But you're-- you're from the Ninth Ward?
###202 TIARA: No, I'm really from the Third Ward, but I stayed back
###205 [INAUDIBLE].
###207 I just really came back here when my brother and my cousin
###210 got shot in Houston.
###212 DAVID CHOE: Your brother and your cousin are from here?
###214 TIARA: Yeah.
###214 DAVID CHOE: They went to Houston
###215 after Katrina and they--
###217 TIARA: Got into with them people out there, and they
###220 killed them.
###220 DAVID CHOE: Who?
###221 TIARA: I don't know the boy's name, but my brother's named
###223 Vincent Williams and my cousin named Yolanda Stiles.
###226 DAVID CHOE: And they both got shot?
###227 TIARA: Yeah.
###228 DAVID CHOE: And are--
###229 are they OK? or--
###230 TIARA: No, they passed.
###231 They passed away.
###233 DAVID CHOE: Oh my goodness.
###236 So what's the situation now?
###237 I mean, it looks like there's--
###239 TIARA: It's really terrible out here.
###242 It's terrible.
###243 DAVID CHOE: I mean, what--
###244 TIARA: It's bad.
###245 It's not really fit for people to come back.
###247 DAVID CHOE: So, so why did you?
###249 TIARA: 'Cause my mama wanted to [INAUDIBLE]
###251 'cause where we stay at, it's kind of
###254 straight, and then it ain't.
###255 DAVID CHOE: So roots is here, you stay here, home is here.
###258 TIARA: Home is here.
###259 DAVID CHOE: Even if it's bad like this?
###261 HARRY KIM: Who are your neighbors?
###263 TIARA: I don't really have neighbors.
###265 I don't really have neighbors.
###267 DAVID CHOE: So it's just you?
###268 Just walking around the street by myself?
###270 TIARA: Yeah, fixin' to go to the bus stop.
###272 
###275 DAVID CHOE: We're up in the Third Ward.
###277 We're gonna hang out with these guys.
###278 So I'm Dave.
###279 BLING BLING: I'm Bling Bling.
###280 DAVID CHOE: Bling Bling?
###281 This is Harry.
###282 BLING BLING: Bling Bling.

###301 [INTERPOSING VOICES]
###303 DAVID CHOE: Is that the General?
###304 The Third Ward General?
###305 BLING BLING: Yeah.
###305 Oh oh.
###306 DAVID CHOE: The General is cooking all kinds of goodness.
###309 The General definitely takes care of his army.
###311 They're fed well.
###313 People are smiling.
###314 Where are we?
###315 This is the world?
###316 THE GENERAL: Pretty much.
###318 Out of all 50 states.
###319 This state.
###320 DAVID CHOE: Out of all 50 states, Louisiana, this is the
###323 center of the world?
###324 THE GENERAL: The center.
###325 DAVID CHOE: This is the world.
###327 THE GENERAL: This is the epitome.
###328 DAVID CHOE: I'll tell you what, you're the most
###329 hospitable, that's for sure.
###331 THE GENERAL: I was born and raised in Metairie, Louisiana.
###333 I went to school with whites.
###335 Asian, Indian.
###339 Matters not the different.
###341 The only thing my mother told me about any individual is
###347 when that person hits you?
###348 You hit that person back.
###350 She never taught me about color.
###352 Because they were all my friends.
###354 Yeah.
###355 DAVID CHOE: What you got in there, sausage?
###357 THE GENERAL: Turkey necks and sausage.
###358 DAVID CHOE: Turkey necks.
###358 THE GENERAL: A little celery.
###359 DAVID CHOE: Turkey necks.
###361 That's delicious.
###362 
###368 Josephine, Third Ward clique.
###371 That's where we're at.
###372 HARRY KIM: New Orleans.
###373 DAVID CHOE: See you guys later.
###373 Josephine Third Ward clique.
###375 MALE SPEAKER: Uptown.
###376 HARRY KIM: Uptown.
###378 MALE SPEAKER: Uptown Josephine.
###380 DAVID CHOE: Uptown Josephine.
###382 HARRY KIM: Uptown.
###383 DAVID CHOE: Third Ward.

###389 Y'all be cool.
###390 [INAUDIBLE].
###392 DAVID CHOE: Third Ward.
###394 MALE SPEAKER: Byyyye!
###395 HARRY KIM: Bye!
###397 DAVID CHOE: By far the most at home I've felt
###399 on this entire trip.
###400 By far the best food I've had on this entire trip.
###403 Unbelievable.
###404 I'll always remember.
###406 We'll always have a home here.
###407 Take it all the way Miami.
###409 Be there hopefully by tomorrow.
###411 As the sun sets over the Big Easy, we head home.
###415 And hopefully get to the Atlantic Ocean by tomorrow.
###419 
###427 Pretty much had the most amazing experience
###429 of the trip so far.
###432 I can't believe how nice these people were and how delicious
###436 the food was.
###437 The sauce--
###438 I don't know what was in there.
###439 Spicy as fuck.
###441 Got all the sinuses going.
###442 Delicious.
###443 But as the sun sets over New Orleans, we head, hopefully,
###447 on our last leg of the race towards the east, and
###451 hopefully soon, these mosquito bite-ridden, diseased,
###456 sunburned toes will get to touch the Atlantic Ocean.
###459 
###470 HARRY KIM: [LAUGHS]
###476 
###487 DAVID CHOE: Is it cool of we film the ride?

###556 DAVID CHOE: Thank you so much, man.
###557 HARRY KIM: Thank you.
###557 MALE SPEAKER: Shit, I'd give you a ride anywheres y'all
###559 want to go but it would my pocketbook.
###562 I probably--
###563 I got enough gas to make it to my job.
###565 That's the American way, bro.
###567 I'd seen y'all three poor motherfuckers on the side of
###570 the road, seen y'all with a camera, said, wait a minute,
###571 what the hell's going on?
###573 [ALL LAUGH]
###574 DAVID CHOE: Well, thank you so much for the ride.

###629 DAVID CHOE: All right.
###630 [HORN HONKS]
###633 MALE SPEAKER: Let me get out of here.
###635 
###646 DAVID CHOE: So here we are in Theodore, Alabama.
###650 And I was in the Pilot getting a drink and taking a piss, and
###654 I noticed this guy Jerry moping around.
###656 And I noticed the jail tattoo, got a cross right here.
###660 And the skulls--
###663 the skulls, that's that?
###665 Treasure chest.
###666 
###668 Seahorse, that's hard-core.
###670 Jerry just told me something very strange.
###672 He said he's locked up.
###674 He's in jail.
###675 JERRY: In prison.
###676 DAVID CHOE: But obviously he's not locked up 'cause he's here
###679 talking to me, so what's--
###681 JERRY: I'm on a-- we have a work release program in the
###684 penitentiary.
###686 There's one in Mobile.
###689 This is like the Mobile area.
###690 And we get to come out and work during the day and at
###694 night and stuff.
###694 When we get paid, they get all our money.
###696 It really sucks.
###697 DAVID CHOE: And then you gotta go back to jail.
###698 JERRY: Yeah, I gotta go back tonight.
###700 DAVID CHOE: So if you don't mind me asking,
###702 what was the crime?
###704 JERRY: DUI.
###705 DAVID CHOE: DUI?
###706 JERRY: Yeah, too many.
###707 You get four DUIs, it's a felony.
###710 DAVID CHOE: Wow, you like to drink.
###711 JERRY: Yeah, I like to drink.
###712 DAVID CHOE: How was-- so prison doesn't seem that bad.
###715 Is it horrible?
###716 JERRY: Well, until you get to where I'm at,
###719 it's kind of horrible.
###720 I've been locked up for three years.
###722 DAVID CHOE: With a DUI?
###723 JERRY: Yeah.
###723 DAVID CHOE: What are you not telling me, Jerry.
###724 JERRY: Oh, I mean for real.
###725 DAVID CHOE: Three years for DUI?
###727 Then you really like to drink.
###729 JERRY: I got a 10-year sentence for DUI.
###731 DAVID CHOE: Wow.
###732 10 years.
###733 Don't drink and drive.
###734 What is the biggest problem day to day that you face while
###738 you're in prison?
###739 JERRY: Money.
###739 DAVID CHOE: Money?
###740 JERRY: Yeah.
###740 They take all your money.
###741 DAVID CHOE: So you work here.
###742 JERRY: And they get it.
###743 DAVID CHOE: And they take 90% of it?
###746 JERRY: 40% and then 25% for restitution.
###750 DAVID CHOE: So you get like a dollar an hour.
###751 JERRY: I get like, let's see, $30 out of $100, maybe.
###756 HARRY KIM: Fuuuuck.
###758 DAVID CHOE: Well, did you learn you lesson?
###760 JERRY: Oh, yeah, I've learnt my lesson, no doubt.
###761 DAVID CHOE: Can I buy you a drink right now?
###763 JERRY: I'm fine.
###765 No more drinking.
###766 HARRY KIM: Not even on your time off?
###767 JERRY: Not even on my time off.
###768 DAVID CHOE: I totally don't believe you, but all right.
###771 All right.
###772 So let's talk--
###774 we're drifters.
###774 We're on the road.
###775 We're hitch-hiking.
###776 JERRY: OK.
###777 DAVID CHOE: Let's make a run for it.
###778 JERRY: Naw.
###779 DAVID CHOE: Come on, man.
###780 JERRY: That's escape.
###781 DAVID CHOE: Yeah, you got seven more years.
###782 Fuck this, man, let's go to Miami.
###784 JERRY: No, let's don't do that.
###786 DAVID CHOE: Let's go to Florida, man.
###787 JERRY: Let's don't do that.
###789 DAVID CHOE: All right, Jerry.
###789 You're no fun.
###790 Let's escape.
###791 Come on, man.
###791 JERRY (LAUGHING): No way.
###792 DAVID CHOE: Let's get the fuck out of here, man.
###794 JERRY: I got to get back to work, man.
###794 Nice meeting you.
###795 DAVID CHOE: Fuck work, man.
###796 C'mon, Jerry.
###797 Let's get out of here.
###798 JERRY: I can't do it.
###799 Good luck.
###801 DAVID CHOE: We're here in Alabama at the dog park.
###803 We're only gonna be through Alabama 'cause it's this big,
###805 where we're going through, the 10.
###807 Theodore, Alabama.
###809 The dog races.
###810 Santa's little helper.
###811 It's fucking on.
###812 I'm ready for my trifecta.
###814 Superfecta.
###815 
###831 Today's is day 15 on our journey.
###834 We're somewhere in the panhandle of Florida.
###836 We're trying to get to Miami, and look at what we found.
###839 Fellow drifter, fellow train-hopper.
###841 FREDDY: Right.
###841 DAVID CHOE: Used to jump the train all the time?
###843 FREDDY: All the time.
###844 DAVID CHOE: So during all your years of train-hopping, what's
###847 the craziest thing you ever seen.
###849 FREDDY: I seen [INAUDIBLE]
###850 I seen sexual acts on the train.
###852 I seen-- oh, man.
###853 DAVID CHOE: What--what did you see on the train?
###855 You saw--
###855 FREDDY: Oh, I seen a lady give a man a blow job
###857 DAVID CHOE: On a--
###858 FREDDY: On the train, the train ran along.
###861 I seen 'em cooking on the train.
###862 They have their pots and stuff for cooking.
###865 DAVID CHOE: Wow.
###866 FREDDY: You sees a lot of wild stuff on a train.
###868 DAVID CHOE: But you haven't done it in a while?
###870 FREDDY: No.
###870 I ain't in shape--
###871 I'm a old man now.
###873 I ain't quite the shape I used to be.
###875 DAVID CHOE: How was that blow job, though?
###877 FREDDY: It wasn't on me, but I'll say, I'll say
###881 it aroused me, huh?
###883 I was sitting there listening, I'm listening,
###885 you know what I mean?
###886 It ain't embarrassing.
###887 I'm sitting their listening--
###889 DAVID CHOE: Hey, man.
###889 If you're hopping trains and there's people getting blow
###891 jobs, wouldn't you want to hop the trains all the time?
###894 FREDDY: No.
###894 Not really.
###895 DAVID CHOE: Hey, what do you do--
###897 last question.
###898 What do you do when you're, you know, you're on the train
###901 and you gotta do number two?
###904 FREDDY: Boo-boo there and throw it out the door.
###906 DAVID CHOE: You boo-boo there, and you throw it out the door.
###909 Throw it out the door.
###909 Thanks, Freddy.
###910 FREDDY: Yeah, man.
###911 DAVID CHOE: Wish us luck.
###912 FREDDY: I wish y'all luck, man.
###914 
###944 DAVID CHOE: Whew!
###946 All right, Florida.
###947 
###951 It's a lonely road.
###953 So we just got a ride in, uh--
###956 I have no idea where we are.
###957 Somewhere in the panhandle of Florida.
###960 And the trains are very sporadic, so we might just
###964 hitchhike to Miami.
###966 If we could catch a train, that'd be great, but if not
###968 we'll just thumb it out.
###971 Thumbs up, America.
###973 Fucking love you.
###974 
###1003 MIKE: Hey.
###1003 DAVID CHOE: What's your name?
###1004 MIKE: Mike.
###1004 DAVID CHOE: Mike, I'm David.
###1005 This is Harry.
###1006 We're just going cross-country.
###1007 This is our 15th day.
###1008 We came all the way from LA.
###1009 We're hopefully going to hit Miami tonight.
###1012 We're tired, dirty.
###1013 MIKE: 15 days, you just come from LA?
###1015 DAVID CHOE: Yeah, hitchhiking, hopping the trains.
###1017 So we're tired, dirty.
###1018 You know.
###1020 MIKE: You look like you can use a couple shirts.
###1023 DAVID CHOE: I mean, I don't--
###1024 if you got it, that would be great.
###1025 We smell really bad, but I don't want to trouble you.
###1028 MIKE: Yeah, man.
###1029 Here, let me give you something.
###1029 DAVID CHOE: Are you serious?
###1030 MIKE: Yeah, hang on.
###1032 Here, he's one.
###1032 You like pink?
###1034 DAVID CHOE: Hey, we'll take whatever.
###1035 MIKE: There you go, there's one there.
###1037 DAVID CHOE: Oh, thanks, Mike.
###1038 HARRY KIM: Thanks a lot, Mike.
###1039 DAVID CHOE: Take care.
###1039 Thanks for the ride.
###1041 Wow.
###1042 You want pink or orange?
###1044 HARRY KIM: I'll wear the pink one.
###1046 DAVID CHOE: All right.
###1047 Thank you.
###1048 
###1052 I guess one size definitely fits all.
###1054 
###1058 Best shirts ever.
###1060 Wow.
###1060 HARRY KIM: I guess we'll sleep warm tonight.
###1062 
###1064 DAVID CHOE: Oh my god.
###1067 Oh my goodness gracious.
###1068 
###1079 We're definitely, definitely going to get rides in these.
###1082 HARRY KIM: Huaahhh.
###1082 DAVID CHOE: I don't know if they'll be the rides that we
###1083 want, but we'll definitely get rides in these.
###1086 HARRY KIM: Yeah.
###1086 DAVID CHOE: Thumbs up, America.
###1088 We love cats and flowers and butterflies.
###1092 HARRY KIM: [MEOW]
###1093 
###1104 DAVID CHOE: So we just got dropped off by Mike, and then
###1106 this bus pulled up right behind us
###1108 with a bunch of workers.
###1110 I don't know where they're going to work, but they just
###1113 stopped and a bunch of them got off to use the restroom.
###1115 And Jacinto, our cameraman that is very fluent in
###1118 Spanish, asked them if we could have a
###1120 ride and he said yes.
###1121 And now we're on the bus.
###1123 
###1127 Hola.
###1128 
###1141 I'm not sure exactly what happened, but somewhere in the
###1144 panhandle of Florida, we got on a bus and I think we're
###1149 somewhere near Miami.
###1150 We got on a bus that was predominantly farm workers.
###1154 They're tomato farmers.
###1155 And the boss said if we worked for free he might give us a
###1158 ride closer in to town.
###1160 So off to make salsa.
###1163 Thumbs up, America.
###1165 
###1178 We made it.
###1178 We're in Miami.
###1179 We went from the Pacific to the Atlantic.
###1183 
###1220 Well, America, we did it.
###1222 Here we are in the beautiful Atlantic Ocean on Day 16 as
###1226 the sun comes up.
###1230 But I gotta tell you, boy, do I got a lot of words for you.
###1235 I mean, I have a lot of--
###1238 I got a lot of mixed emotions right now.
###1240 America, you're like the bossy know-it-all, you're like the
###1245 kid I want to beat up.
###1247 You're like--
###1249 I want to like--
###1250 you're like the half-sister that I want to fuck, or the
###1253 actual sister that I want to fuck.
###1255 You're like, you're like my ex-girlfriend that I want to
###1258 duct-tape and shit on her chest.
###1261 But like I fucking love you and I hate you and I want to
###1264 like slap you and I want to dry-ass-rape you, but then I
###1267 want to like pet you and cuddle with you and like dry
###1270 hump you and like cuddle with you and spoon you and hold
###1273 hands with you.
###1275 I love you and I hate you and I have very mixed feelings
###1278 toward you, but I feel like I'm gonna cry right now
###1279 because it has been one of the most amazing American
###1283 adventures ever.
###1284 Every day I woke up, I had no idea what was going to happen,
###1287 and it was just--
###1288 the people are so crazy and so diverse and so--
###1292 the good, the bad and the ugly, it's all American.
###1295 And I'm really sad 'cause I'm gonna be home soon, and it's
###1298 gonna be, like--
###1300 16 days to trek across this country, through land, ocean,
###1305 lakes, rivers, cars, trains, automobiles.
###1309 And then we're just going to fly back in five hours, and
###1311 tomorrow morning I'm gonna wake up.
###1313 I know exactly what I'm gonna eat for breakfast.
###1314 And it's just going to be like hitting a brick wall.
###1317 But America, Dave and Harry are on the road.
###1322 We're here, we're there, we're everywhere.
###1323 Who knows where you'll see us next.
###1326 HARRY KIM: The romance is back, America.
###1327 DAVID CHOE: We love you.
###1328 HARRY KIM: We love you.
###1328 DAVID CHOE: No matter how many harsh things you said to us
###1330 and no matter how many bad things we've said to you, in
###1333 the end, we forgive.
###1334 HARRY KIM: We love.
###1335 DAVID CHOE: We--
###1335 we love.
###1336 We're full of so much love.
###1337 We forgive.
###1338 We forget.
###1339 And it's-- tomorrow we go to sleep and we wake up and it's
###1342 just a whole new day.
###1343 And--
###1346 HARRY KIM: Au revoir.
###1347 DAVID CHOE: Thumbs up, America.
###1348 We love you.
