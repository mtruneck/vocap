WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR: CNN projects that
Barack Obama will be re- elected president


2
0:0:21,14 --> 0:0:25,449
of the United States. He will remain in the
White House for another four years.

(END VIDEO CLIP)


4
0:0:25,789 --> 0:0:30,55
CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: Month of campaigning,
primaries, caucuses, rallies, debates, all


5
0:0:30,55 --> 0:0:35,18
leading up to that moment -- the announcement
of a victory and a second term in office for


6
0:0:35,18 --> 0:0:42,0
President Obama. It takes at least 270 votes
in the electoral college to win the presidency.


7
0:0:42,0 --> 0:0:47,26
In Tuesday`s elections, CNN projected that
President Obama won more than 300. In the


8
0:0:47,26 --> 0:0:51,539
race for the White House, Republican and Democratic
candidates clashed over their differences,


9
0:0:51,539 --> 0:0:56,17
but as that race came to a close, the president
talked about the things that Americans have


10
0:0:56,17 --> 0:0:59,3
in common. And he talked about what lies ahead
for the nation.


11
0:0:59,3 --> 0:0:59,449
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


12
0:0:59,449 --> 0:1:0,3
BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA: It doesn`t matter whether you


13
0:1:0,3 --> 0:1:0,17
are black, or white, or Hispanic, or Asian
or Native American, or young or old, or rich,


14
0:1:0,17 --> 0:1:0,3
or poor, able, disabled, gay or straight.
You can make it here in America if you`re


15
0:1:0,3 --> 0:1:0,32
willing to try.


16
0:1:0,32 --> 0:1:0,329
(APPLAUSE)


17
0:1:0,329 --> 0:1:0,46
OBAMA: I believe we can seize this future
together, because we are not as divided as


18
0:1:0,46 --> 0:1:2,79
our politics suggest. We are not as cynical
as the pundits believe. We are greater than


19
0:1:2,79 --> 0:1:9,409
the sum of our individual ambitions, and we
remain more than a collection of red states


20
0:1:9,409 --> 0:1:10,9
and blue states. We are and forever will be
the United States of America, and together


21
0:1:10,9 --> 0:1:15,95
with your help and God`s grace, we will continue
our journey forward and remind the world just


22
0:1:15,95 --> 0:1:42,2
why is that we live in the greatest nation
on Earth. Thank you, America.


23
0:1:42,2 --> 0:1:57,39
God bless you. God bless these United States.

0:1:57,39 --> 0:2:2,599

25
0:2:2,599 --> 0:2:7,84
AZUZ: For former Governor Romney Tuesday`s
election marked the end of a journey that


26
0:2:7,84 --> 0:2:12,76
started nearly a year and a half ago. He won
the Republican Party`s presidential nomination,


27
0:2:12,76 --> 0:2:17,75
but he wasn`t able to rally enough support
to win the White House. Last night he congratulated


28
0:2:17,75 --> 0:2:21,61
his opponent, he thanked his supporters and
he talked about his hopes for the country`s


29
0:2:21,61 --> 0:2:21,739
future.


30
0:2:21,739 --> 0:2:22,129
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


31
0:2:22,129 --> 0:2:25,81
MITT ROMNEY, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:
This election is over, but our principles


32
0:2:25,81 --> 0:2:31,19
endure, I believe that the principles upon
which this nation was founded are the only


33
0:2:31,19 --> 0:2:38,6
sure guide to a resurgent economy and to renewed
greatness. Like so many of you, Paul and I


34
0:2:38,6 --> 0:2:46,4
have left everything on the field. We have
given our all to this campaign.


35
0:2:46,4 --> 0:2:48,859
(APPLAUSE)


36
0:2:48,859 --> 0:2:55,109
ROMNEY: I so wish, I so wish that I had been
able to fulfill your hopes to lead the country


37
0:2:55,109 --> 0:3:0,23
in a different direction, but the nation chose
another leader and so Ann and I join with


38
0:3:0,23 --> 0:3:6,26
you to earnestly pray for him and for this
great nation. Thank you and God bless America.


39
0:3:6,26 --> 0:3:9,7
You guys are the best. Thank you so much.


40
0:3:9,7 --> 0:3:15,739
RONALD REAGAN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA, NOVEMBER 4, 1980: I`m not frightened


41
0:3:15,739 --> 0:3:21,129
by what lies ahead and I don`t believe the
American people are frightened by what lies


42
0:3:21,129 --> 0:3:21,349
ahead.


43
0:3:21,349 --> 0:3:21,56
(APPLAUSE)


44
0:3:21,56 --> 0:3:26,19
GEORGE H.W. BUSH, NOVEMBER 4, 1988: I want
to work for the hopes and interests, not only


45
0:3:26,19 --> 0:3:31,95
of my supporters, but of the governors and
of those who didn`t vote at all. To those


46
0:3:31,95 --> 0:3:38,749
who supported me I will try to be worthy of
your trust and to those who did not, I will


47
0:3:38,749 --> 0:3:39,68
try to earn it.


48
0:3:39,68 --> 0:3:47,689
BILL CLINTON, NOVEMBER 4, 1992. On this day,
with high hopes and brave hearts and massive


49
0:3:47,689 --> 0:3:52,29
numbers the American people have voted to
make a new beginning.


50
0:3:52,29 --> 0:3:57,959
GEORGE W. BUSH, DECEMBER 13, 2000: The presidency
is more than an honor, it is more than an


51
0:3:57,959 --> 0:4:2,73
office, it is a charge to keep and I will
give it my all.


52
0:4:2,73 --> 0:4:7,7
BARACK OBAMA, NOVEMBER 4, 2008: Because of
what we did on this day, in this election,


53
0:4:7,7 --> 0:4:12,489
at this defining moment, change has come to
America.


54
0:4:12,489 --> 0:4:16,18
(END VIDEO CLIP)


55
0:4:16,18 --> 0:4:21,329
AZUZ: Some big moments for those men who were
all on their way to be presidents of the United


56
0:4:21,329 --> 0:4:25,52
States. But how much do you know about the
position itself? Here is a little quiz we


57
0:4:25,52 --> 0:4:29,77
have for you. You may know that you have to
be at least 35 years old, and you have to


58
0:4:29,77 --> 0:4:34,96
have been born in the U.S., but you also have
to have lived in the U.S. for at least how


59
0:4:34,96 --> 0:4:38,9
many years?


60
0:4:38,9 --> 0:4:47,2
The answer is 14. Next up, who was the longest
serving U.S. president? Franklin D. Roosevelt


61
0:4:47,2 --> 0:4:51,62
was elected to four terms, and that record
appears safe, because there`s a current limit


62
0:4:51,62 --> 0:5:1,259
of two terms. That song you hear played for
president at official events, what`s the name


63
0:5:1,259 --> 0:5:12,669
of that? It`s titled "Hail to the Chief."
What about the oldest elected U.S. president?


64
0:5:12,669 --> 0:5:20,759
Ronald Reagan was 69 when he became president.
And the youngest elected? John F. Kennedy


65
0:5:20,759 --> 0:5:29,2
was elected at the age of 43. And finally,
what is the U.S. president`s salary? $400,000


66
0:5:29,2 --> 0:5:30,729
a year.


67
0:5:30,729 --> 0:5:38,83
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It`s time for "The Shoutout."
Which of these U.S. political positions serves


68
0:5:38,83 --> 0:5:45,0
a two year term? If you think you know it,
shout it out! Is it president, senator, representative


69
0:5:45,0 --> 0:5:52,5
or vice president? You`ve got three seconds,
go!


70
0:5:52,5 --> 0:5:58,78
U.S. representatives serve two year terms,
the shortest of these options. That`s your


71
0:5:58,78 --> 0:6:2,819
answer and that`s your "Shoutout."


72
0:6:2,819 --> 0:6:10,94
AZUZ: That means the entire U.S. House of
Representatives, all 435 voting seats were


73
0:6:10,94 --> 0:6:17,9
up for election yesterday, before yesterday`s
vote, Republicans had control with 240 seats,


74
0:6:17,9 --> 0:6:23,389
Democrats had 190 seats, and five seats were
vacant. Last night, CNN projected that Republicans


75
0:6:23,389 --> 0:6:28,689
would keep control of the House. When we produced
this show, Republicans had won an estimated


76
0:6:28,689 --> 0:6:36,509
221 seats, Democrats had won 163 seats, and
51 seats were still undecided. As a balance


77
0:6:36,509 --> 0:6:41,78
of power was closer in the U.S. Senate and
it was going to stay that way. Senators serve


78
0:6:41,78 --> 0:6:48,639
six-year terms, so only a third of the Senate,
about 33 seats, were up for a vote on Tuesday.


79
0:6:48,639 --> 0:6:53,729
Going into that vote, there were 51 Democrats
and 47 Republicans in the chamber, plus two


80
0:6:53,729 --> 0:6:59,53
independents who usually vote with the Democrats.
When we produced this show, CNN predicted


81
0:6:59,53 --> 0:7:6,199
that Democrats would retain control with 51
seats, and Republicans would have 44 seats.


82
0:7:6,199 --> 0:7:8,83
Independents would have 2. Three seats were
still undecided.


83
0:7:8,83 --> 0:7:13,62
Now, to get the latest numbers in the House
of Senate races, go to cnnstudentnews.com.


84
0:7:13,62 --> 0:7:18,849
We`ll talk about the White House and both
houses of Congress. Voters also cast their


85
0:7:18,849 --> 0:7:23,849
ballots on all sorts of state and local races
yesterday. We are going to focus on that top


86
0:7:23,849 --> 0:7:29,729
spot in state government, the governor. 11
were voted on yesterday. Let`s start with


87
0:7:29,729 --> 0:7:35,39
these six states. Vermont, Delaware, West
Virginia, Missouri, North Dakota and Utah.


88
0:7:35,39 --> 0:7:40,39
In these states, the incumbent, the current
governor was running for reelection, and in


89
0:7:40,39 --> 0:7:45,55
all of them, the incumbent won. The five other
states that had gubernatorial elections yesterday


90
0:7:45,55 --> 0:7:49,659
were definitely going to get a new governor.
The races in Washington and Montana hadn`t


91
0:7:49,659 --> 0:7:53,8
been polled when we recorded this program,
but in New Hampshire and Indiana, the new


92
0:7:53,8 --> 0:7:58,509
governor will be from the same party as the
current governor. North Carolina is the only


93
0:7:58,509 --> 0:8:3,8
state where we know there will be a different
party in the governor`s mansion. So what it`s


94
0:8:3,8 --> 0:8:7,87
like to actually get out and vote in the presidential
election? Especially for the first time? And


95
0:8:7,87 --> 0:8:12,33
I-Reporter in Georgia cast her first ballot
yesterday. She talked to us about why she


96
0:8:12,33 --> 0:8:16,81
thought it was both cool and important for
her to vote.


97
0:8:16,81 --> 0:8:22,319
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


98
0:8:22,319 --> 0:8:46,24
SHELBY NORMAN, FIRST TIME VOTER, AGE 18: Hi,
I`m Shelby Norman, and I`m in Saville (ph),


99
0:8:46,24 --> 0:8:46,47
Georgia waiting to go inside to start my first
voting experience. I`ve been preparing for


100
0:8:46,47 --> 0:8:46,71
a little while, now I`ve been reading news
editorials and learning a little bit about


101
0:8:46,71 --> 0:8:46,87
each candidate and everything that I will
be voting for.


102
0:8:46,87 --> 0:8:47,15
So, I`m inside now, I`m getting ready to vote.
They`ve got my photo I.D. ready to go. And


103
0:8:47,15 --> 0:8:47,97
right now I`m feeling pretty anxious and pretty
excited. Being a first time voter is a really


104
0:8:47,97 --> 0:8:51,26
crazy experience, and it`s something that
I really looked forward to for a while now.


105
0:8:51,26 --> 0:8:58,29
And so, I`m just really excited to go in there
and stand in line with my parents and we`re


106
0:8:58,29 --> 0:9:4,8
just going to stand and wait. I`m not really
sure how long it will take, but the line seems


107
0:9:4,8 --> 0:9:10,959
pretty short, and we can actually wait inside,
which is really nice, because it`s really


108
0:9:10,959 --> 0:9:15,1
cold outside. So it`s time to go.


109
0:9:15,1 --> 0:9:24,38
So I just came out of my polling place and
I have finished voting for the first time,


110
0:9:24,38 --> 0:9:26,389
and I got my commemorate "I`m a Georgia Voter"
sticker.


111
0:9:26,389 --> 0:9:27,8
The whole process took around 45 minutes.


112
0:9:27,8 --> 0:9:31,48
It`s very important for you to do your research.
Because you are not just voting for who you


113
0:9:31,48 --> 0:9:35,26
think is going to be president, but also your
state representatives. It`s very important


114
0:9:35,26 --> 0:9:39,589
that you go out and exercise your right to
vote, because not everyone gets that choice.


115
0:9:39,589 --> 0:9:43,91
And it`s really important because your voice
does get heard whether you think it does or


116
0:9:43,91 --> 0:9:44,18
not.


117
0:9:44,18 --> 0:9:44,99
(END VIDEO CLIP)


118
0:9:44,99 --> 0:9:50,45
AZUZ: All right, before we go, here is a look
at what it was like to be here at CNN on election


119
0:9:50,45 --> 0:9:51,18
night.


120
0:9:51,18 --> 0:9:58,16
So, the time is just after 7:15 p.m. The staff
of CNN STUDENT NEWS is just coming right now


121
0:9:58,16 --> 0:10:3,11
on election night. There is so much anticipation
in the air, it`s so much going on here, at


122
0:10:3,11 --> 0:10:6,81
CNN Center. We thought we`d give you a behind
the scenes look of election night 2012. Come


123
0:10:6,81 --> 0:10:6,87
on.


124
0:10:6,87 --> 0:10:17,67
So, we are downstairs right now in the CNN
Center food court, and what you see behind


125
0:10:17,67 --> 0:10:22,99
me, is a panel assembled by CNN en Espanol.
We are looking at folks who are Democrats,


126
0:10:22,99 --> 0:10:26,87
Republicans, independents. What they are going
to be viewing is watching the coverage live


127
0:10:26,87 --> 0:10:31,279
as it develops and giving their comments and
their thoughts on this election night. All


128
0:10:31,279 --> 0:10:34,75
the while, taking a look at it, up on the
big screen here, at CNN Center.


129
0:10:34,75 --> 0:10:39,41
We are now at CNN`s Image and Sound headquarters
where a lot of the shows, a lot of the materials


130
0:10:39,41 --> 0:10:44,86
we show you are edited. In fact, you could
see CNN STUDENT NEWS being put together as


131
0:10:44,86 --> 0:10:46,149
I speak.


132
0:10:46,149 --> 0:10:52,48
Well, there is more to be seen on CNN STUDENT
NEWS this week, but for now we have reached


133
0:10:52,48 --> 0:10:56,56
the end of the race, so we will be back on
the air Thursday, and we will be looking for


134
0:10:56,56 --> 0:12:56,56
your support.
