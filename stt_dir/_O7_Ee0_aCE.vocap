###23 CHRIS ROACH: How's that mic sounding now, is it all right?
###26 Yeah, I have duct tape.
###27 We could actually kind of put a pinch on it and tape it up.
###32 -Yeah.
###33 CHRIS ROACH: You want to do that?
###34 -Yeah, that's fine.
###35 
###38 CHRIS ROACH: When you put a little pressure down on it--
###42 yeah.
###43 Yep, 250F.
###45 This is my son's 150 and my other son's little TTR50.
###51 We're all into motocross, man.
###53 
###61 Yeah, Santa Cruz is just doing an amateur team this year.
###66 -Oh really?
###67 CHRIS ROACH: Yeah, so--
###68 oh, here they are, right here.
###70 And I called them, you know, I've been dealing with them
###73 forever, but I'll be their only rider that's, I guess, a
###79 professional.
###80 But I'm old.
###82 You know what I mean?
###83 [LAUGH]
###85 I got a model from last year with Santa Cruz.
###87 [INAUDIBLE]
###88 I don't know if you ever saw that one.
###90 But, this year's board, this one here.
###101 And this is what I did when I rode, I think, in , like, '90
###107 or '91 or something.
###107 I just stickered my board this way.
###110 And then they sublimated it and made those graphics.
###112 That one right there I ride at the Donner Vintage one.
###115 That was my first model, the one with the genie up there is
###121 my first one.
###123 And I rode that at that Donner Vintage contest.
###125 -We probably didn't have one.
###128 [LAUGH]
###129 I got lucky.
###130 When I was younger, I gave all that shit to my mom, you know?
###134 I knew I wouldn't build any out with all your friends and
###136 shit, taking everything.
###138 Palmer's board, for the championship, him and Brushy
###141 we're going against each other.
###143 And it was raining on the snow, so I quit riding,
###146 started drinking and cheering them on because it was so
###148 shitty, I mean, you couldn't even get above the pipe.
###150 It says Roach did not win the truck, but I did get mad, and
###155 we will get drunk [LAUGH]
###157 in '92.
###159 And he just destroyed his board.
###160 And I'm like, dude, let me have that board.
###161 Write me a story on it.
###163 He should do [INAUDIBLE], too.
###166 My biggest influence in snowboarding was him and Noah,
###169 for sure-- no doubt about it.
###171 I mean, those guys were the gnarliest guys, man.
###174 We need Noah's rhino to get up there, man.
###177 We're going to have to walk.
###178 
###181 NOAH SALASNEK: So you know, he's an a regional Grass
###183 Valley guy.
###183 And though I do live here now, I'm not from this area.
###186 So Chris, and Tucker, and Monte, and all these guys are
###189 from Grass Valley.
###190 And I always respected that whole little crew because they
###193 were all so talented.
###194 So I'd see them riding and ended up meeting then and
###198 becoming friends with them, I guess, over the years.
###200 Yeah, it's always been a mutual friendship, either
###203 skating, or snowboarding, and now motocross
###205 occasionally together.
###206 And we stayed friends, and it's pretty cool.
###209 He's a really good skateboarder, too, and people
###211 probably don't know that he's a really good
###212 motocross rider, too.
###213 He's an avid rider.
###215 And he's been, actually, competing and doing well.
###217 So it's good to see he's that motivated, and he's with his
###220 family and works hard.
###222 He's a good guy, so much respect for him.
###226 CHRIS ROACH: Right now, I'm in the process of clearing all
###228 this shit out, all this--
###229 you know what poison oak is?
###231 Yeah.
###231 You guys have that?
###232 So you don't want to touch any of that.
###235 I get it horribly bad.
###238 Well, I'm going to clear all this out, so you can actually
###242 walk around everywhere here.
###245 Yeah, this would've been cool to be able to film this.
###247 This is like, you could've gotten up there, the view.
###252 This is a triple jump right here.
###254 That would've been sick back drop.
###256 Click third gear, and then it's about a 60 foot double.
###259 And then this one's about 82 right here, step down triple,
###262 right here.
###265 Yeah it's fun, and it goes all the way around.
###267 I mean, we could walk it.
###267 It goes way up around the woods over there.
###269 It's got a sick step up, and then another table out, and
###272 then back round.
###273 It's about a 45-second long track.
###276 I do a lot of amateur stuff.
###277 I ride the 30-plus intermediate class, and then
###280 the 250 novice class.
###281 And locally, I ride the E-street races and
###286 then we do hang town.
###289 We did the MX crossover down there.
###292 I think I got it than that in the monster class.
###295 And in the intermediate class, I got third.
###298 Fuck, that sucks.
###299 I wish I could write it.
###300 It'd be so sick with you standing up on the ditch, and
###304 me stepping up to you.
###306 There's a rock plant that's just right down the street
###309 that I work with all the time.
###310 They're going to sell me some sand for cheap, so I'll bring
###314 a bunch of sand in here, and just this'll
###316 be like a sand track.
###317 That'll be sick.
###318 And then, once again, you just land.
###320 So this is just a third gear little step up right here.
###323 I tried to mimic Hangtown's step up.
###325 Yeah this give here that you've going to step down,
###327 [INAUDIBLE]
###327 and then the line is kind of right there.
###330 I mean, you can see, it's like the perfect, fastest
###333 lines on the edge.
###334 It's so nice.
###335 The tracks are probably about 45 minutes away from me.
###338 So having this here, it gives me the exercise
###340 whenever I want it.
###341 And it's just so nice.
###344 Rider's 2 and 1/2, almost three, and he's real
###347 interested in it.
###348 And my other son, Talon, he's 8, and he's
###351 totally into motocross.
###354 And Jaren's just, he's got the 150.
###356 He loves it too.
###358 So they're all into snowboarding and motocross.
###361 Yeah, they love skateboarding, but I'm kind
###364 of hurt right now.
###365 So it's too bad because they should be skating
###368 even though I'm not.
###368 But right now they've kind of do everything that I do.
###371 So skateboarding's had to take a backseat to
###374 everything right now.
###375 It's unfortunate.
###376 That's what hurts the most on my leg.
###379 So I've got to wait to get it fixed in early winter, and
###382 I'll probably be back to skateboarding.
###384 
###386 Skateboarding, I started when I was really young.
###388 I started skateboarding, probably, when I was five
###390 years old or whatnot.
###391 And if I could get my leg fixed now, I'd still be
###394 skateboarding, which I plan on doing.
###396 I mean, skateboarding will always be in my blood.
###399 Skateboarding gave me snowboarding, is
###401 the way I see it.
###402 And snowboarding has given me what I have now.
###405 So I owe a lot to, probably, skateboarding and
###408 snowboarding.
###409 They give you the same great feelings when you learn
###412 something, or you're progressing or whatever.
###414 Oh, well I grew up in Salinas till I was
###416 probably 10 years old.
###417 And we were skateboarders down there in Salinas.
###420 And then, when I moved up here, we met the skateboarders
###423 that a lived in Grass Valley.
###424 And Tucker Fransen was one of the them.
###426 He's the one that got me into snowboarding.
###428 And we start going to Donner ski ranch
###431 with him and his family.
###434 We hiked around, I guess, before we went to Donner in
###438 the back country.
###439 And then Donner ski ranch was the first resort that opened
###442 up to us for snowboarding.
###444 And then we spent most of our time there, probably, for the
###447 next five years, at Donner.
###449 Probably been John Ackright, and Damian Sanders, Tucker,
###455 myself, my brother--
###458 yeah that's probably--
###458 I don't know, those are the guys I was riding with.
###461 Yeah, Monty and I rode pretty much together
###463 the whole time we--
###467 he drove before I could even drive.
###468 And so we were always riding together.
###470 And he had the same passions, did the same things, so--
###474 CIRCE WALLACE: Chris and Monty were the quintessential Grass
###479 Valley troublemakers.
###481 You know, they were cute.
###482 They were blonde..
###484 They were very California.
###485 
###488 They were kind of good old boys.
###490 So they were always having fun.
###491 And Chris had a really respectable style.
###496 I mean, to this day, I think he was one of the most stylish
###501 snowboarders.
###503 He had a very distinct way of riding that a lot of people
###508 really responded to.
###509 DAMIAN SANDERS: Yeah, Chris Roach?
###510 He's got a talent.
###511 He's got a style that was just insane.
###513 He had a skate style that was so cool.
###515 He would poke out a frontside air and just hold it for the
###517 longest time like Chris Miller on a skateboard.
###519 And it was just the coolest looking thing.
###521 It's like a guy at a motocross whipping it and just holding
###523 that whip forever.
###524 It was so much style.
###525 And everybody else was, like, get the trick
###527 done, do it real quick.
###528 But Roach was right out of the stoner guy
###531 from the surfer movies.
###532 He was like a Spicoli.
###534 He was fucking hilarious.
###535 TODD RICHARDS: Roach's style was all about
###537 being, like, really--
###539 fucking train--
###540 
###543 Roach's style was all about being super squatty, and
###548 really tight and compact.
###550 I mean, we were grabbing way up on our
###552 tip and doing methods.
###553 Every grab that Roach did was like full
###556 skate, around his feet.
###558 Everything was proper.
###560 And there wasn't just wherever your hand happens to hit while
###564 you're flying through the air.
###564 But that's what we were doing back East.
###567 And those guys were all tight.
###569 Everything the super tight.
###571 KEVIN ENGLISH: They were there kind of what I'd say is the
###573 next generation.
###573 They were the young dudes when Damian, and Sione, and Graham
###577 were the big guys.
###578 And I definitely got into in.
###580 There's a shot of Chris Roach doing a frontside I grab in
###584 the Western Front that is so insane.
###586 And it's probably only like three feet off the ground.
###589 But he was, in my mind, the first guy that brought style
###592 to snowboarding.
###593 So in terms of how you actually rode, I would try to
###597 more emulate, probably, Chris Roach than anybody else.
###600 MIKE RANQUET: Because he was the coolest looking due I'd
###602 ever seen at that point.
###604 I remember first seeing him in the Sims ad.
###606 And I snowboarded for Sims then.
###609 And just doing this frontside nose bone.
###613 Aaron was like, dude, that guy's so rad.
###616 You know?
###617 CHRIS ROACH: Well, I always just did what felt good to me.
###621 And I know I mean I had posters up of Palmer and
###625 Kidwell doing backside airs in my room when I was a kid.
###629 So I felt like I needed to look like that or something
###633 close to that.
###634 And what I saw me riding, or whatever I
###636 always felt, eh, whatever.
###637 But everyone always said that I had good style or whatnot.
###640 And now, I really appreciate it more than
###642 I did then, I guess.
###644 
###647 SHAWN FARMER: You know what always used to trip me out?
###650 This is so funny, man, but I used to look at Chris Roach
###654 and go, that's looks like Palmer.
###658 That's Palmer.
###659 I thought it was Palmer.
###660 And I'd go, but Palmer's riding goofy?
###663 That's not Palmer.
###664 Palmer doesn't ride goofy.
###665 I used to think Chris Roach was Shaun Palmer.
###668 You know, I did.
###671 But then I'd realize, he's goofy, man.
###674 Just in videos, when I first started seeing him.
###677 And then, I don't know, I mean, I'm just
###678 equating the style.
###679 But yeah I talk to people who don't know who Chris Roach is.
###684 I'm like, really?
###687 Fuck, come on.
###689 MIKE HATCHETT: I'm always impressed when a snowboarder
###692 today knows who Damian Saunders is, or
###696 Chris Roach, Kidwell.
###699 You've got to know where it came from.
###701 And I always give props the kids that have done their
###704 homework and seen the old videos or whatever.
###707 I mean, a lot of guys are like, who's Damian?
###710 Who's Chris Roach?
###711 I was like, are you kidding me?
###712 Who's Chris Roach?
###715 Hey, if you're not a pro, that's cool.
###718 But if you're a pro snowboarder, you'd better know
###719 who Chris Roach is, in my opinion.
###722 -So Mr. Roach, how do you feel about
###725 California Snowboard Series.
###727 CHRIS ROACH: I would do it again.
###728 [INAUDIBLE]
###729 GS is rad.
###730 They set up good GS courses.
###732 It was structured and pipes and types of stuff.
###736 Dude, I don't know, [INAUDIBLE].
###738 Yeah, fully because I won that.
###743 CHRIS ROACH: The California state snowboard series, and
###746 that was just kind of the lope for the local mountains.
###749 We went up to Shasta and just all the local
###752 mountains around here.
###753 And I think I won that series, but we raised gates at that
###759 point, too, and half-pipe gates,
###762 moguls, it didn't matter.
###763 We did everything at that point.
###765 We went to Breckenridge, and that was the World Cup.
###769 And I broke my Sims board that I'd bought in the pipe.
###775 And Tom Sims actually watched me break it.
###778 And I think that was my biggest break, was from Tom
###781 watching me snap that board because he might have been
###785 watching me earlier in the day.
###787 And then he invited me to is hotel room.
###791 And he had probably 100 boards in there, and he said, you
###794 pick one and if you do well, we'll try to see what we can
###797 do from here.
###798 And that was probably the best thing I ever could have done,
###801 is break that board.
###802 TODD SIMS: Well, that whole NorCal scene had a lot of
###807 players, like Tucker Fransen, and Chris
###810 Roach, and Noah Salasnek.
###812 These guys all sort of had kind of is the Sims soul in
###819 those days because they had their skateboard background,
###824 and they were low key, and they performed incredibly.
###829 And that was sort of the whole image of what a Sim rider was,
###833 just almost by default because these guys--
###837 I don't remember the exact time that each one of them
###839 ended up on the team, but it was almost like, sure, of
###842 course you're on the team.
###844 CHRIS ROACH: Oh for me, it was a dream come true because I
###846 was a skateboarder.
###847 And I got all the skateboards and all that.
###850 And then Sims was such a big company for means because I
###853 was a kid, on it was Sims.
###855 It was like skating, snowboarding, and
###858 knowing who Tom was.
###860 And Terry Kidwell rode for them, and Shaun Palmer.
###863 And those guys were my heroes of snowboarding then, as well,
###866 so it was rad to be on the same team as them.
###869 And Sims was paying me $700 a month, and I was, like, that's
###873 a career, man, that's killer.
###874 You know, when you're that young.
###875 And by the time I switched to Santa Cruz, I got on with
###880 Santa Cruz, and they were paying me good money, and then
###882 Quicksilver, and got with Dragon, and Vans.
###886 And I just felt like, at that point, that I could probably
###889 make a living off it.
###891 So I don't know what year it was or whatever.
###894 But I knew I couldn't work, man.
###896 And I had to do that because I didn't know what the hell else
###897 I was going to do.
###899 Didn't do good in school.
###901 Wasn't that smart.
###902
