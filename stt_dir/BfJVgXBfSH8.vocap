###81 We have a lock.
###83 It's him! -Initiating protocol 117-alpha. All stations on deck!
###86 
###92 Shall I play it again, sir?
###93 
###96 Sir?
###97 
###99 Commander Lasky?
###100 
###107 Cryopods opening.
###109 
###117 Lasky? You okay?
###117 
###122 Are you alright?
###122 
###125 Lasky, let's go!
###127 
###130 Hastati Squad, four minutes to the rendezvous point.
###132 Copy, Vickers. Timer four minutes.
###135 Will you be able to shoot with those hands?
###137 We'll find out.
###139 Come on! -Axios!
###140 
###170 Move it!
###176 Tchatkova, checkpoint.
###178 Chen, checkpoint.
###179 50 seconds
###181 Go!
###182 
###186 Where are you guys?
###187 RV in 15 seconds.
###188 Ready?
###190 I'll see you at the party.
###191 
###199 Sully!
###200 We have to leave him!
###200 Lasky, what the hell? -Come on!
###201 Lasky!
###204 Ten seconds!
###206 
###209 Lasky, hurry it up!
###210 Landing in 3-2-1
###214 Enemy inbound. They'll be on us in 35 seconds.
###217 Fresh mags in your weapons, prepare to attack.
###220 Whst?
###220 Our objective is to neutralise the insurrectionists and acquire the target. We move on my mark.
###227 30 seconds.
###228 We should flank them a force a surrender.
###230 They're too close to flank! Innies never surrender.
###232 Dimah and I could circle around, there's still time.
###235 We can make it.
###235 25 seconds
###236 Guys.
###239 It's our best move.
###241 20 seconds
###242 No, we're sticking to my plan. ON MY MARK.
###245 It won't work.
###245 You're not in charge anymore, Lasky.
###246 Tom, just do what he says.
###248 15 seconds.
###250 Those are my orders.
###251 I don't care.
###252 10 seconds
###253 
###255 5 seconds
###257 Axios!
###259 Lasky!
###259 
###285 Hastati Squad leader on the field. Exercise paused.
###293 Let me guess, Lasky. You ignored orders.
###295 Just another strategic casualty, sir.
###300 Unacceptable.
###302 
###305 Game over.
###306 Shoulder your weapon, cadet. Your little escapade kept Hastati Squad from achieving its objective.
###312 
###314 Again.
###315 
###330 Exercise complete. Zero wins, Hastati defaults.
###336 
###339 Shit.
###340 
###354 Robot tagged you?
###359 Once with two meters. Twice from one.
###363 I'm still numb from all the stun rounds.
###366 I'm always numb
###368 
###379 Hastati, hold arms!
###385 
###391 General Black, sir!
###392 
###397 Let me remind you cadets: This academy bears the name of the Roman general Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo.
###407 Because he represents honour, valour, allegiance.
###414 General Corbulo was to take his own life in the name of the empire.
###421 Corbulo did not hesitate nor question.
###425 He loyally obeyed, screaming "Axios!" as he fell upon his own sword.
###431 Axios. I AM WORTHY.
###441 But I'm afraid, cadets, today you have proven to be anything but.
###445 We are at war with insurrectionists. Terrorists who would like nothing more than to see all of us dead.
###453 Had this been an actual Firefight the rebels would have likely killed every member of Hastati Squad.
###459 
###465 Every single one of you at this academy was sent here because your parents are the upper eschelon of the United Nations Space Command.
###474 Because all of you are its future, and I expect you to act like it.
###481 Understood, sir!
###484 Well what are you waiting for? Lead them on tour, Orenski.
###488 
###492 Axios!
###493 Axios!
###495 Hastati, right turn!
###501 Double ???
###503 
###527 Corbulo Academy of Military Science Circinus-IV
###533 
###577 Sully, do you ever stop talking?
###580 No, seriously. I'm on to something, here.
###584 The comms are messed up and I'm decoding something kick-ass.
###588 ONI's hiding stuff from us, I'm positive. They've got secrets, man.
###593 Stop stepping on our dicks, Lasky.
###595 Hey, ease up, Gingerbread.
###597 No, Sully. Vickers is right. My combat score sucked because of you.
###602 Don't bother, JJ. He's gone soft. He's an Innie-lover now.
###606 Dimah, that order didn't make any sense.
###609 Doesn't have to make sense. Just follow it.
###612 
###627 I'm trying to survive here, okay?
###629 You need to respect the chain of command. The UNSC isn't the enemy. The Innies are.
###635 Spoken like a true believer.
###638 Yeah, well. At least I believe in something these days.
###640 
###643 Cadet Thomas Lasky report to Colonel Mehaffey's office immediately.
###649 
###683 No, we're sticking to my plan. ON MY MARK.
###685 It won't work.
###2 You're not in charge anymore, Lasky.
###686 Tom, just do what he says.
###2 15 seconds
###688 They're my orders.
###689 I don't care.
###690 Pause.
###691 
###694 You don't care? You do realise your helmets transmit everything.
###698 No excuse, sir.
###700 You continue pulling down your squad, you're going to end up with a lot of enemies.
###704 Yes, sir!
###704 
###707 I served under your mother and I know what she's like. And I sure as hell don't need to tell you that Colonel Lasky's not going to
###713 allow a son of hers to leave this academy without a diploma.
###718 I wouldn't know what my mother thinks, sir. I never see her.
###724 It's been a long war. Your mother holds a lot of hands.
###730 So I'm told, sir.
###732 
###737 You know, Thomas, I've seen a lot of cadets come through here. Many have suffered like you.
###746 Pain like that can't be forgotten. But you can learn how to tolerate it.
###752 I'll do my best, sir.
###753 That will be all.
###754 
###763 How long have you had those blisters?
###767 It's been on and off for a few weeks, but these are from yesterday.
###772 Any other symptoms?
###774 It's getting hard to breathe.
###776 Okay. Let's keep an eye on it. Cryo training can take its toll.
###779 
###839 You really shouldn't be looking at that stuff, Sully.
###841 
###844 Score.
###845 
###856 "Your academic performance is exemplary. But your combat scores are disappointing."
###868 
###899 Hey, little bro. Hello from Jericho 7. It's day 131 of deployment. So, I gotta show you something.
###905 Mom's gonna flip when she sees this. But whatever.
###907 
###914 It's still a little raw. But we got a big drop on an innie stronghold next week, wanted to get it done before then. Anyways--
###924 So you haven't been court-marshalled yet, then?
###926 
###942 I'm not apologizing.
###943 yes you are.
###944 At least I believe in something.
###946 I do believe in something.
###947 Yeah, so do I.
###948 Like what?
###950 Just not in stupid orders that lead to needless violence.
###955 Negotiating isn't an option anymore, Tom.
###957 So we're brainwashing kids and then sending them in to exterminate a bunch of overtaxed farmers.
###963 Farmers? That's who you think they are? You have no idea what the innies are like.
###967 
###971 I have a pretty good idea.
###972 
###974 Well then, you should know how much they hate us and that they're not going to stop fighting until we're all dead.
###983 Can you blame them?
###987 Yeah. I can. I blame them for a lot of things.
###992 
###996 And you should, too.
###997 
###1013 I'm staying safe, doing my job. I just want you to do your job.
###1021 Oh, an by the way, nice check mate, bro.
###1026 Yet again.
###1029 Okay. New game. It's your move.
###1034 And hang in there. I know it's tough with mom being gone all the time. Being alone.
###1043 She loves you, so do I.
###1047 Miss you, buddy.
###1048 
###1055 I miss you, too.
###1056 
###1060 Lights out, doors closing.
###1063
