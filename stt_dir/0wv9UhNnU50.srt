0:0:11,469 --> 0:0:16,99
Big lairy rear wheel drive saloons like Jaguar's
new XFR-S might not be everyone's cup of tea


2
0:0:16,99 --> 0:0:27,13
but I personally happen to think they are
'the business'. This is one of the reasons


3
0:0:27,13 --> 0:0:34,79
why.


4
0:0:34,79 --> 0:0:41,899
Okay the Jaguar XFR-S is not all about shredding
rear tyres in third gear at 65 miles an hour


5
0:0:41,899 --> 0:0:49,689
but because you can it really makes it a special
kind of car. What are we talking about here?


6
0:0:49,689 --> 0:0:58,409
£80,000 the XFR-S costs.
It does have 542bhp from its five litre supercharged


7
0:0:58,409 --> 0:1:7,56
V8. That's enough to send it to 60 miles an
hour in 4.4 seconds and to a top speed limited


8
0:1:7,56 --> 0:1:10,49
to 186 miles an hour.


9
0:1:10,49 --> 0:1:14,79
So it's quick. Very, very quick.


10
0:1:14,79 --> 0:1:20,93
What's it like other than in a straight line?
If you want to explore what a car like this


11
0:1:20,93 --> 0:1:27,44
can do you really do need to come to a track.
I have to say that despite the slightly disturbing


12
0:1:27,44 --> 0:1:35,7
two ton kerb weight the XFR-S is an absolute
hoot on the track. It does feel a bit big.


13
0:1:35,7 --> 0:1:41,67
The brakes do feel like they're being a bit
taxed when you really lean on the car into


14
0:1:41,67 --> 0:1:44,97
a corner and
ask it to stop in a big way.


15
0:1:44,97 --> 0:1:50,49
But do you know what? It's fantastically well
sorted this thing. The steering is great.


16
0:1:50,49 --> 0:1:55,36
They've made all sorts of modifications to
the chassis, to the steering just to crispen


17
0:1:55,36 --> 0:1:55,909
everything up.
They say it's 30% stiffer than the standard


18
0:1:55,909 --> 0:1:55,909
XFR.


19
0:1:55,909 --> 0:2:6,72
On a track you can feel that because the way
it manages its weight is just great. It really


20
0:2:6,72 --> 0:2:11,39
is. This one also has a new eight speed quick
shift gear box. The same gearbox that you


21
0:2:11,39 --> 0:2:16,439
get in an F type. That makes a big difference
because there is a ratio for every occasion,


22
0:2:16,439 --> 0:2:23,56
and the speed of the shift, is very good.
Very, very good indeed.


23
0:2:23,56 --> 0:2:29,76
One thing I'm not quite sure about is the
noise that the XFR-S doesn't make. I mean


24
0:2:29,76 --> 0:2:32,84
you look at it and you look at the French
Racing Blue paintwork.


25
0:2:32,84 --> 0:2:37,51
You look at the huge spoiler that there is
at the back, and you think, 'Well when I fire


26
0:2:37,51 --> 0:2:40,34
it up my ears are going to start bleeding'.


27
0:2:40,34 --> 0:2:46,73
It doesn't really make that much noise. I
wish it made quite a lot more noise. I mean


28
0:2:46,73 --> 0:2:50,38
they're only going to make a hundred of these
things so you're talking about a tiny audience


29
0:2:50,38 --> 0:2:52,349
of real hard core enthusiasts.


30
0:2:52,349 --> 0:3:0,39
I'm sure that those enthusiasts would want
this car to make more noise than it does.


31
0:3:0,39 --> 0:3:6,98
The ride on the road is at best firm going
on too stiff, I think. And when you press


32
0:3:6,98 --> 0:3:12,459
the dynamic button, it gets really stiff.
Too stiff I think for a Jaguar. I tell you


33
0:3:12,459 --> 0:3:20,86
what though, as a road car, the XFR-S so long
as you can live with the ride, it's a pretty


34
0:3:20,86 --> 0:3:25,0
wonderful thing I'll tell you. I lean it's
so quick.


35
0:3:25,0 --> 0:3:31,37
On the motorway is fine, it's okay. The steering
is a lot crisper than the normal XFR. Everything


36
0:3:31,37 --> 0:3:36,319
is just that much more focused. I don't think
the compromise is that bad.


37
0:3:36,319 --> 0:3:42,489
There is one very big question that the XFR-S
has to answer and that comes in the form of


38
0:3:42,489 --> 0:3:52,95
the E63 AMG. Let's have a go in that now.


39
0:3:52,95 --> 0:4:1,19
Straight away from the moment you climb into
it the E63 feels like a slightly more expensive,


40
0:4:1,19 --> 0:4:6,72
quite a lot more serious piece of kit. The
whole cabin just has this focus.


41
0:4:6,72 --> 0:4:12,94
There are all sorts of toys to play with down
here. Possibly too many toys for some people.


42
0:4:12,94 --> 0:4:17,159
For those people you just press one very simple
button, the AMG button and that just makes


43
0:4:17,159 --> 0:4:21,47
everything go bonkers. Or you press the AMG
button in the other direction and it just


44
0:4:21,47 --> 0:4:22,52
calms everything down.


45
0:4:22,52 --> 0:4:28,11
There are whole load of things settings within
those two extremes to change to the personality


46
0:4:28,11 --> 0:4:36,419
of the E63 to whatever mood you're in. If
you really want it to be a proper track weapon


47
0:4:36,419 --> 0:4:41,65
then you put it in all its most aggressive
settings and then it is magnificent.


48
0:4:41,65 --> 0:4:53,88
I don't know if you can hear this but I'm
just going to put my foot down. Oh, I mean


49
0:4:53,88 --> 0:5:1,81
that, that's a proper noise. Why doesn't the
Jag make that noise? That sounds like there's


50
0:5:1,81 --> 0:5:9,74
something really incredible going on beneath
the bonnet. You never quite get that with


51
0:5:9,74 --> 0:5:12,919
Jag. I want that from a 542 horsepower rear
wheel drive saloon, please.


52
0:5:12,919 --> 0:5:16,57
The steering, is that a little bit crisper
than the Jag's. It's not. It's not as heavy.


53
0:5:16,57 --> 0:5:24,84
Jaguar put a lot of weight into the power
steering and, it gives it a slightly artificial


54
0:5:24,84 --> 0:5:28,5
feel. Whereas the Mercedes just feels lovely
and accurate and precise.


55
0:5:28,5 --> 0:5:33,77
There's a little bit more torque in the Mercedes
than there is in the Jaguar, and amazingly


56
0:5:33,77 --> 0:5:39,71
the Mercedes weighs about 100 kilogrammes
less than the Jaguar. As a result the E63


57
0:5:39,71 --> 0:5:44,139
definitely feels that little bit sharper,
that little bit more potent in a straight


58
0:5:44,139 --> 0:5:44,699
line.


59
0:5:44,699 --> 0:5:56,47
The E63 does many things fantastically but
I think this is its best party trick. The


60
0:5:56,47 --> 0:6:3,72
chassis in this car is just brilliant. It's
got this amazing combination of proper agility,


61
0:6:3,72 --> 0:6:9,33
it definitely feels more agile than the Jag
and yet it's got this nimble lightness on


62
0:6:9,33 --> 0:6:17,9
its feet and it rides better if you put it
into comfort.


63
0:6:17,9 --> 0:6:19,74
The fact that its £7,000 cheaper completely
seals it for Mercedes in the end. The Jag's


64
0:6:19,74 --> 0:6:26,62
a lovely car, it really is. I think they've
got a little bit further to go yet before


65
0:6:26,62 --> 0:6:32,949
they can put one over a car as brilliant as
the E63 AMG.


66
0:6:32,949 --> 0:6:40,24
I don't know. This is some kind of a benchmark.
If you want a car with four doors and a thumping


67
0:6:40,24 --> 0:6:48,3
great V8 engine under its bonnet, and monster
performance, this is the one to have. Game


68
0:6:48,3 --> 0:8:48,3
over.
