###6 BETH HOYT: All right, Olga Kay and I are here at the YouTube
###8 space in beautiful Playa Del Rey, the most
###11 beautiful Del Rey--
###12 oh, not counting Lana Del Rey.
###14 Don't tell her.
###14 OLGA KAY: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###16 That was me speaking Russian.
###17 Tonight is International Comedy Night, presented by
###20 Comedy Gives Back.
###22 You're going to see--
###23 [AUDIENCE CHEERING]
###23 OLGA KAY: Yeah, yeah!
###24 BETH HOYT: All right, yeah.
###26 It's live.
###26 OLGA KAY: You're going to see some of the best international
###28 stand-ups from all over the United States.
###31 BETH HOYT: Oh my gosh, man.
###32 There is so much stuff going on this whole week.
###34 People are ready to bust down the doors to get involved.
###36 OLGA KAY: Yeah, I'm actually scared, all right, because I
###38 called my mother back in Russia just to
###41 be on the safe side.
###42 I'm just kidding.
###43 My mom doesn't have a phone.
###45 BETH HOYT: It's an international joke.
###48 That's not all.
###49 Don't forget to check out all of the live events at
###50 youtube.com/comedyweek.
###53 I mean, it's all so funny, I'm scared of it.
###55 We're very scared.
###56 OLGA KAY: It's terrible, hilarious, and lots of
###58 frightening stuff.
###59 BETH HOYT: Right.
###59 Also, last night's comedy show, it's been uploaded and
###61 can be streamed on the Comedy Week page, so check that out.
###65 OLGA KAY: Yeah, please.
###65 And hey, don't forget that every day, we have multiple
###68 Comedy Week videos being posted.
###69 So go check out videos from Improv
###72 Everywhere, Rhett and Link--
###73 I'm in it-- and the new video from Tim and Eric, "Goatee,"
###76 which also can be seen on youtube.com/comedyweek.
###79 BETH HOYT: Oh my god, we have to get out of here and let
###82 this show happen.
###82 OLGA KAY: Yeah, you're right.
###83 I'm going to go first all right?
###84 BETH HOYT: Yeah, OK.
###85 Oh, she's showing off.
###88 I can do that, too.
###89 We're going to be right back tomorrow, but right now it's
###91 time for our international stand-up show.
###93 
###114 ROVE MCMANUS: Thank you, thank you very much.
###118 Thank you.
###119 Welcome to Comedy Week on YouTube.
###122 How is everybody here in the house tonight?
###126 Welcome, wherever you are watching around the world.
###129 Thank you for pausing whatever hilarious Psy video clip you
###133 had to put aside to be here tonight.
###136 Thank you.
###137 We are live, so everybody in the audience, please, watch
###140 yourselves.
###140 I know when it's live, you go, they can't stop me.
###143 You just want to yell "titties" or something, but
###145 rein it in.
###147 Grow up.
###149 I know it's YouTube.
###149 This is where we all first saw the two girls and the one cup.
###153 But, at the same time, there's a lot of innocent, overweight
###157 Japanese cats just trying to jump in and out of
###160 their boxes in peace.
###163 Have some dignity.
###165 I am your host for this evening, wherever you are
###168 watching this.
###169 [AUDIENCE CHEERING]
###171 ROVE MCMANUS: That's great.
###172 
###174 Thank you, thank you.
###179 Thank you for pretending to know who I am.
###183 That's very--
###184 yes, your laughter gives you away.
###186 My name is Rove McManus.
###188 I am an Australian comedian and talk show host.
###191 This is very exciting for me to be here.
###193 For those of you who don't know me, yes, Rove, I realize
###195 it's a bit of a weird name.
###198 At least I thought so 'til I moved here to Los Angeles.
###202 Did you know there's a person who lives in this city called
###204 Zooey Deschanel?
###206 That's the name of a person.
###209 I'm like, whooey with the what now?
###210 That can't be a real thing, surely.
###213 But what I've also discovered is that, in this city
###216 especially, celebrities love a crazy name.
###219 I fit right in here.
###222 Normally what happens is, the celebrities, they'll pair up
###225 to get themselves a really cool celebrity fun nickname--
###230 like Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are Brangelina, Ben
###234 Affleck and Jennifer Garner are Bennifer.
###236 And Keith Urban and Nicole Kidman are Keyhole, I think.
###242 Listen, could we--
###243 might have to research that, yes--
###245 OK, cool.
###246 I'm--
###247 yep--
###247 I'm being told I don't have an earpiece.
###249 Good.
###251 But it's now even gone even further, where--
###254 I don't know if you've noticed, but the celebrities
###256 are so bang up for a crazy name, they're giving all their
###259 kids crazy names.
###262 Yes, says the audience.
###263 I've noticed, too.
###266 Yeah, observant.
###269 Because that's how you all talk to me.
###270 You've suddenly become very well-spoken British.
###273 I'm a YouTube audience member.
###276 I cannot be trusted with a real candle,
###279 however, but still.
###281 Ah, ah.
###284 But, yeah.
###284 Crazy baby names, like Beyonce might be having another one.
###289 Blue Ivy was her first.
###291 That was great.
###292 Other great names out there, thank you celebrities--
###295 Apple, Shiloh, Suri, Banjo, Moon Unit, that's a name.
###301 My favorite, though, I think, would be Nicolas Cage, the
###305 actor Nicolas Cage, as opposed to the mechanic Nicolas Cage.
###310 I don't know why I needed to bring that up,
###312 but there you go.
###313 But Nicolas Cage named his son Kal-El.
###317 K-A-L hyphen E-L. Does anybody in the room tonight know the
###323 significance of that name?
###325 Yes, yell it out.
###327 Yell out.
###327 AUDIENCE: Superman.
###328 ROVE MCMANUS: Superman, yes, yes.
###329 Be proud, nerd.
###330 He's into Superman.
###333 Yell it out, my friend.
###334 
###337 Sure.
###339 You may as well yell it out because if you know this,
###340 you're not getting laid tonight, so be proud.
###343 Get it out there.
###344 For those of you who don't know-- and you probably will
###346 in the next couple of months with the movie coming--
###348 Kal-El is Superman's birth name, from his
###352 home planet of Krypton.
###356 Well done, Nicolas Cage.
###358 You've just come up with the perfect way to make sure that
###361 your son comes home from school with his underpants on
###364 the outside as well.
###365 Genius.
###368 Well, ladies and gentlemen, you have plenty of fantastic
###371 acts coming up tonight.
###373 You have logged on to a wonderful show, Comedy Week
###375 here on YouTube, international night.
###378 One more round of applause as we get into it.
###381 Our first performer tonight, ladies and
###383 gentlemen, Daniel Kinno.
###385 
###392 DANIEL KINNO: Thank you.
###392 Give a go for Rove one more time, your host.
###396 
###398 Thank you.
###400 It's good to be back in America.
###403 I just got back from Canada.
###406 Funny already, all right.
###408 I was in Winnipeg, Canada.
###410 When I was there, somebody goes, are you
###411 nervous to be here?
###412 It's the murder capital of Canada.
###415 Murder capital of Canada.
###417 I got all scared, I Googled it--
###419 35 people a year.
###422 That is adorable.
###426 I live in Los Angeles.
###427 35 people got killed in my apartment building last year.
###429 
###432 We didn't even call the cops.
###433 
###436 So I kept reading.
###437 They don't kill each other as much as we do in Canada.
###439 Only 500 people get murdered in Canada a year.
###442 America, 20,000.
###444 We're number one, yay.
###445 Pew, pew, pew pew.
###448 So they got us beat there.
###449 But here's something odd-- and this is true-- their suicide
###451 rate in Canada is four times their murder rate.
###455 2,000 people kill themselves every year.
###458 That's weird, right?
###459 How does that even work?
###460 Somebody breaks into your house in the
###461 middle of the night.
###462 You're like, oh my god, are you think about killing me?
###463 Me, too, me too.
###467 What a coinkydink.
###469 Don't even waste your bullets, I already got
###470 the sleeping pills.
###472 Well, it's either that or they have the dumbest cops in the
###475 world in Canada.
###476 They think everything's a fucking suicide.
###477 
###483 They show up at a crime scene, get off their horses or
###485 whatever they do, I don't know.
###488 Hey, what happened here?
###489 Oh my god, this is the worst suicide I've ever seen.
###491 
###495 This guy must have been so sad.
###498 He broke into his own house, tied himself to this chair,
###503 and then shot himself in the back of the head five times.
###505 
###508 Some people just don't want to live, I guess, eh?
###512 Let's go get some free health care.
###515 More for the rest of us.
###518 I was just in Ch--
###521 that's a weird laugh.
###522 
###525 I was reading an article today about China.
###526 Did you guys know this?
###527 China has the fastest-growing number of
###529 millionaires in the world.
###531 Did you know that?
###532 Yeah.
###532 It's got to be bittersweet for them.
###534 No one in China can pronounce the word "millionaire."
###539 There's a lot of L's and R's, that's all I'm saying.
###542 Relax.
###543 I've done that joke in China.
###544 They hate it there, too.
###547 Your instincts are in the right place.
###550 But that's true. "Time Magazine" said that they spend
###552 so much time and money in America that the entire mail
###554 order bride trend is now reversing.
###556 Because it used to be, American guys would go China,
###559 get a wife, then bring her back to America.
###561 Now Chinese millionaires are coming over here
###563 to pick up our sluts.
###565 
###567 That's messed up.
###568 Those are our sluts.
###569 
###571 We can't even hide these girls from the Chinese
###573 millionaires, right?
###574 They all have Chinese shit tattooed
###575 right above their asses.
###577 
###581 If you have one here, relax.
###582 I'm sure you're not a slut.
###584 I'm sure you're into strength and courage.
###585 
###590 I did that joke one time.
###590 A girl came up to me after the show.
###592 She goes, you're an asshole.
###593 I'm spiritual.
###595 Yeah, you sound like it.
###598 That's a whole lot of enlightenment coming out of
###599 your mouth right there.
###601 Just because you put a Chinese symbol above your asscrack
###603 doesn't bring you closer to Buddha, OK?
###605 It brings you closer to my hotel room.
###609 There's nothing spiritual about that experience?
###611 It's more of a Catholic thing, really.
###613 
###617 People get touchy about Catholics.
###619 Don't worry.
###620 Catholics get touchy, too.
###621 
###625 It's all good.
###626 
###630 I knew that Catholics were up to no good, right.
###632 They have a room in the church called the rectory.
###634 What did you think was going to happen to you?
###637 I'm never a following a horny old guy into a rectory.
###640 Can we just stay here in the hand job-ory until my parents
###646 pick me up?
###648 Then I can go to the shrink-ory, pretend this shit
###650 never happened.
###651 
###654 Tell you a little bit about myself.
###655 I was born in Russia.
###657 A lot of people don't believe me when I say that because I
###659 don't sound like a James Bond villain.
###662 I did my best to lose the accent because girls say they
###665 like accents--
###665 not the Russian one.
###667 That is not a sexy accent.
###669 You never see a Russian lover in a movie.
###671 [RUSSIAN ACCENT]
###671 Hello, how are you?
###672 
###675 You are a pretty female person.
###679 Would you like to drink vodka and then complete me?
###681 
###685 But that's true.
###685 I was born in Russia in a small town
###687 right outside of Chernobyl.
###690 People find that odd.
###690 They always go, Daniel, growing up near Chernobyl, did
###692 that affect you in any way?
###694 And it did.
###695 I have a giant penis.
###699 Unfortunately, it's right above my tiny vagina.
###701 
###706 That's a radiation joke.
###707 That's not a dick joke.
###710 Google Chernobyl.
###711 It'll be funnier.
###712 I Google everything now.
###713 Google's amazing.
###714 It's unnecessary for you to learn how to spell the word
###716 "unnecessary." You can throw a U, two N's, and a C into
###719 Google, it goes, did you mean "unnecessary?" Yes, I did.
###721 Thank you.
###724 Let's move this along.
###725 I don't know how people did anything before the internet.
###728 They went to the moon before the internet.
###731 How did they even know there was a
###732 moon before the internet?
###735 Some places still don't have it.
###736 That weirds me out.
###738 I was checking into a hotel a couple weeks ago, and I go, is
###740 there internet in my room?
###741 And the guy looks at me and he goes, no, but there is a phone
###744 in your room.
###746 There's a phone in my pants, and it has internet.
###752 
###756 All right, guys, that's my time.
###757 Thank you very much.
###758 
###760 CAT: My wife's in heat.
###761 Let me tell you something.
###762 There's nothing worse than being married when
###763 your wife's in heat.
###766 You know that voice, right?
###769 She's always like, Mr. Sprinkles, I'm in heat.
###772 Let's have sex.
###775 And I'm like, I don't want to fuck Garfield.
###777 
###786 ROVE MCMANUS: You'll have to excuse our studio audience
###789 while they go, did I just see what I thought I just saw?
###792 You're probably all thinking the same thing.
###793 All right, we are moving hastily along.
###795 As wonderful as that cat in a suit was, I'm going to bring
###800 on our next performer, a man I have had the pleasure of
###804 performing with on many an occasion.
###805 I think he's fantastic.
###807 I know you will, too.
###808 Ladies and gentlemen, Matt Kirshen.
###811 MATT KIRSHEN: Thank you.
###813 Thank you.
###814 ROVE MCMANUS: Hey.
###815 MATT KIRSHEN: Thank you.
###815 Rove McManus, ladies and gentlemen.
###817 It's Rove.
###818 Rove, yeah.
###820 
###823 This is exciting.
###824 Geez, I didn't--
###825 if you'd told me as a kid growing up in 1980s London
###831 that one day I would be on youtube.com, I wouldn't've
###838 believed you.
###839 
###841 I'd be like, no way.
###842 No kid like me gets on youtube.com.
###846 Maybe President Barack Obama gets on youtube.com, but not a
###854 little Englishman like me.
###857 So thank you.
###858 Thank you, people here.
###859 Thank you, viewers at home, for taking time out of your
###862 lazy masturbation to flick over to my tab.
###864 
###867 It's what I'd be doing if I was watching this at home.
###868 I'd have both going at the same time.
###870 
###872 One eye on me, one on the porn-- get mixed up in your
###875 head, good things happen.
###876 
###878 Somewhere an association's being made, and
###880 I appreciate that.
###883 So this just happened to me the other day.
###884 I still haven't processed it.
###886 Because I work nights, this is my job.
###889 So I finish work, and then I do normal things.
###891 So I do things like grocery shopping in the
###894 middle of the night.
###894 I'll do it at 2:00 in the morning when it's just me and
###897 drunks, all right, and the occasional nurse and the
###902 occasional drunk nurse.
###906 I love that.
###907 I love a drunk nurse, not even for any creepy reasons.
###910 It's just like, nurses have the best stories, and if
###913 they're drunk, they share.
###914 
###917 Nurses have stories that would put a sea captain to shame.
###920 Stories with lines in it like, no, you have to understand.
###923 It was a full-sized umbrella.
###925 
###928 But I was just in this 24 hour store, just buying normal
###932 groceries at 2:00 in the morning, like
###933 bread, milk, cereal.
###935 And I put my basket of food next to the register, and I
###937 went to get a couple more things.
###938 And I came back, and it's gone.
###942 My basket's gone.
###943 So I'm looking for the overzealous employee who's
###945 putting everything back.
###947 And then I see the most confused-looking drunk man
###951 leaving with my stuff.
###953 He bought my things.
###956 He bought my--
###957 I don't even know if that's a crime.
###960 I don't know.
###960 If anyone at home knows, comment in.
###962 I don't know what the legality--
###964 I think until you pay for something, it
###965 belongs to the store.
###967 And then he paid for it, so it's his.
###970 But I selected it.
###974 I put all the work in.
###976 I got like a week's worth of food, and he just
###979 waltzed off with it.
###982 I couldn't even be mad at him, either, because he was so
###985 drunk and so baffled.
###988 Because from his point of view, that's just the world's
###991 most convenient convenience store.
###996 He's just staggered in, hammered, and the guy's like,
###998 what do you want?
###999 He's like, this.
###1003 Thank you.
###1006 Thank you, convenience store.
###1007 I'll be back here every night.
###1009 This is wonderful.
###1010 I don't remember having a cat.
###1011 
###1015 Either that, or he was so drunk, he'd forgotten that he
###1018 hadn't already gone to the effort of selecting
###1020 everything.
###1022 Have you ever done that thing where you're really drunk and
###1024 your brain just starts to do useful things?
###1027 Am I the only one who does that?
###1029 Who's just hammered and thinking, well, I'm
###1031 slaughtered.
###1032 Everything's fun, so I might as well get some chores done.
###1035 
###1038 You wake up the next morning and all the bathroom tiles are
###1041 clean, but you've vomited in the freezer.
###1046 It's a trade-off.
###1048 The entire apartment's vacuumed, but
###1050 you've killed a man.
###1054 It's give and take.
###1055 
###1058 Gee, Daniel going straight in with the Catholic stuff, at a
###1061 time that we have a new pope, as well.
###1063 Of all the times to be doing that.
###1065 The pope is barely out of--
###1068 I don't know where popes come from.
###1072 He says that-- first Latin-American pope, as well.
###1075 First pope from Latin America.
###1077 [AUDIENCE CHEERING]
###1077 MATT KIRSHEN: I know.
###1079 Yeah, it's pretty cool, right?
###1081 I mean, don't worry.
###1083 He's still white and hates gays, so they kept it safe on
###1087 that front.
###1088 They kept the light-skinned homophobe theme
###1089 that's working so well.
###1092 It's an exciting time for gay rights.
###1094 We had the debate in the UK.
###1095 It got passed by Parliament.
###1097 The conservative prime minister voted for gay
###1100 marriage, which is remarkable.
###1102 That's never happened before.
###1103 Not everyone was for it.
###1105 One guy in the middle of the debate actually said the
###1107 words, Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve.
###1113 He said that, out loud, knowing that other people were
###1117 listening, as well, knowing that his words were being
###1120 recorded and everything.
###1121 He thought that was a good thing to say.
###1123 That's on a par with, if it was a debate about whether
###1126 women should have equal pay in the workplace, and he'd just
###1129 stood up and gone, girls smell, and sat down again.
###1133 That's the same level of sophistication.
###1137 He is my second-favorite homophobe.
###1141 I know it's weird to have them ranked, but I do.
###1144 My number one is, and I think will
###1146 always be, Michele Bachmann.
###1149 She has to be because she's the only one I know who's that
###1151 homophobic while being married to such an obviously gay man.
###1158 He's so gay.
###1159 I know I'm like libeling someone on a livestreaming
###1161 thing right now, but he's so--
###1163 if he's not gay, he's putting a lot of effort
###1165 into appearing gay.
###1166 He is really-- have you seen?
###1169 You're on YouTube right now.
###1171 Don't do it right-- open up another tab next to my one,
###1174 and YouTube "Marcus Bachmann interview."
###1177 He is ridiculous.
###1178 I know not everyone who sounds like that is gay, and not
###1180 everyone who's gay sounds like that.
###1181 But the two of them are absurd.
###1185 In the modern era when people are becoming so much more
###1187 accepting, they exist.
###1190 Last year I was in San Francisco during Pride
###1192 weekend, and I would urge any of you to go there, whatever
###1195 your sexuality.
###1196 I was there as a straight guy with my girlfriend, and it's
###1198 one of the best celebrations on Earth of
###1200 humanity and sexuality.
###1202 It's just a massive party where the
###1203 only theme is tolerance.
###1206 And walking through the middle of this park, around which a
###1208 lot of the events are centered, were these two guys.
###1211 And they were in great physical shape, which we could
###1216 clearly tell because all they were wearing were shoes and
###1224 matching cock rings.
###1227 I hope intentionally, by the way.
###1229 I hope that was planned between the two of them.
###1231 I'd hate to think they rocked up independently and like, oh,
###1233 you as well.
###1235 Oh, well, there's no time to go home and change, either.
###1237 This is embarrassing.
###1239 But they were walking through the middle of the park
###1241 together, and it was hilarious and it was wonderful and it
###1244 was fantastic.
###1246 And it was absurdly gay, but still not as gay as Marcus
###1252 Bachmann's voice.
###1255 Thank you very much for listening to my
###1257 part of this evening.
###1258 Take care.
###1258 I appreciate it.
###1259 I've been Matt Kirshen.
###1260 Bye!
###1261 ROVE MCMANUS: Matt Kirshen.
###1262 MATT KIRSHEN: Thank you.
###1263 ROVE MCMANUS: Matt Kirshen.
###1264 
###1267 Yeah.
###1269 Later, Matt and I are going to go to Six Flags with an
###1274 oversized coat.
###1276 He's going to get on my shoulders.
###1279 X2, here we come.
###1282 It's a roller coaster, for those of you not in the
###1286 Angeleno way.
###1287 And I don't know what that means.
###1288 As I say "Angeleno way," it suddenly means you're pregnant
###1291 with a Californian.
###1292 Could be a thing, you don't know.
###1293 Look it up.
###1295 This is one of the things I have found having moved here
###1298 to the States from Australia, is adjusting a little bit.
###1304 And, for the most part, it's not too difficult, but one of
###1306 the things I have kind of struggled with is tipping.
###1311 Because we don't tip as readily as you
###1314 do here in the States.
###1315 Yeah, at cafes and stuff, sure, we'll do it there.
###1318 But I had an experience when I first arrived where I was in
###1321 the men's room.
###1323 I don't know how it is for the women, but sometimes in the
###1326 men's room, there's a guy, like an attendant, there--
###1329 right guys?
###1330 Yes.
###1330 He's got cologne and little hand towels and a bowl of
###1334 mints, because that's what you want when you've just been to
###1337 the toilet.
###1339 Candy.
###1341 How many times have you found yourself in the situation
###1344 going, I just took a dump.
###1346 I could really go with some M&Ms right now.
###1350 But he's there with the towels and everything.
###1352 And I don't mean to brag, YouTube people, but I've been
###1355 able to go to the toilet by myself since
###1357 about the age of three.
###1359 And so I wasn't sure of what to do.
###1362 So I did what I needed to do, and then went
###1364 past, washed my hands.
###1366 The guy gave me a towel.
###1368 I was like, thank you.
###1369 I dried my hands, then walked out but didn't tip.
###1374 Oh, yes.
###1376 I learned a very valuable lesson that day, because let
###1379 me tell you something.
###1380 There is no worse look than you leaving the men's room
###1384 with another guy chasing you demanding payment.
###1387 
###1391 Trap for young players.
###1394 It is indeed a pleasure to welcome our next act, ladies
###1397 and gentlemen.
###1398 You have seen him on "Conan." You have seen him on "Jimmy
###1400 Kimmel Live." You have seen him on "Cougar Town." He's a
###1403 MILF, the absolutely brilliant Rob Delaney.
###1407 
###1411 ROB DELANEY: Thank you, sir.
###1412 Thank you.
###1415 Hello, everybody.
###1418 Nice to see you all.
###1420 In keeping with the international theme, I want to
###1422 tell you a story.
###1423 I recently did a show in Belfast, in Northern Ireland,
###1426 and it's calmed down in recent years.
###1429 It's not as scary anymore.
###1430 But the city's covered with murals back from when it was
###1433 going through its Troubles.
###1434 And you can hire a cab and get a ride around and look at all
###1438 the murals.
###1438 Some of them are really beautiful, some of them are
###1440 sad, like hunger strikers and stuff, but it's just sort of
###1444 how they healed and dealt with it.
###1446 Anyway, I got a cab driver, and he was
###1448 showing me all the murals.
###1449 And as he was about to finish, he said, now I'm going to take
###1452 you, and I'm going to show you the most
###1453 powerful mural we've got.
###1455 It's my favorite mural.
###1456 By I need to tell you, as an American, there's a symbol on
###1459 this mural that you're not going to understand.
###1461 So you'll look at it, sort of absorb it, let it wash over
###1464 you, and then I'll explain the symbol to you.
###1466 So I was excited to learn about a new symbol.
###1468 He pulled around the corner, and there was this seven-story
###1471 tall painting of a British paramilitary soldier, just
###1475 firing tear gas canisters into a pile of kids.
###1478 It was upsetting.
###1480 But then in front of it was this ancient Irish symbol that
###1483 he had mentioned.
###1483 And what it was, it was a giant red circle with a slash
###1487 through it.
###1490 And so I was like, uh-oh.
###1493 Uh-oh.
###1494 Oh, OK.
###1495 And I decided to mess with him a little.
###1497 I was like, OK, so what you're saying is, you take a thing,
###1501 and then you mural up a building, and then you put
###1504 this symbol on it, and the symbol kind of means you
###1506 should do that some more?
###1508 And he's like, no, for goodness' sake.
###1510 What I meant-- no, the symbol, I knew you wouldn't
###1512 know what it is.
###1513 You take a great red, ruby red circle and you then circle the
###1517 entire building with it.
###1519 And then from the northwest to the southeast, you bisect it
###1521 with a mighty red slash.
###1523 And what we're saying is, none for me and mine.
###1525 No, none of that.
###1527 And I was like, OK, I get it.
###1529 So basically you draw something or whatever, you
###1532 take a picture, and then you put this around there and it's
###1534 saying, yeah, a few more of those?
###1535 And he's like, no, for goodness' sake!
###1538 Get the wax out of your American ears, for god's sake!
###1541 And anyway, now you guys know what that symbol is, too.
###1545 So I just wanted to share that with you guys.
###1548 It's my favorite thing that's happened to me in the last
###1550 five years.
###1551 Since this is live on the internet, I want to talk about
###1554 internet filth and porn.
###1556 I grew up in the '80s.
###1557 And when I wanted to masturbate, I had to write a
###1560 letter to a friend's older brother who lived in
###1562 Pennsylvania.
###1564 And he would mail me back the coordinates of where he had
###1567 buried a cigar box 11 years ago with a
###1570 rain-damaged Playboy.
###1572 I would have to take a map, and I'd have to get a friend.
###1575 And we'd have to bring like victuals and dry goods and
###1579 hike though the woods.
###1580 We would get there just as the sun was setting, and we'd dig
###1582 it up, there'd be no more daylight.
###1584 So we'd have to jerk off together just because that's
###1587 all the time that was left.
###1588 
###1591 But now with the internet, it's just filth.
###1592 You open your computer, and you open your AOL homepage,
###1595 it's a gaping butthole.
###1596 It's just total filth.
###1598 Why is it so gross?
###1599 I'm just so glad that I grew up in an age where, when I was
###1602 younger, I would have to jerk off to poetry.
###1604 I used to jerk off to the written word.
###1608 You should try it.
###1609 But now it just is garbage.
###1611 And people are fucking each other in
###1612 their butts a lot online.
###1613 And I don't understand that.
###1615 And I'm not speaking out of school here.
###1616 I tried it.
###1617 When I was in college, I had a girlfriend, and we were like,
###1619 hey, I heard people buttfuck.
###1621 And it wasn't even me.
###1623 I wasn't like, it's my birthday.
###1625 Can I?
###1628 Literally, it might have even been her idea.
###1629 I don't remember.
###1630 I didn't have a hankering for it.
###1631 And so we were going to do it, right?
###1634 So we're having normal penis-vagina sex, and then
###1636 she's like, yeah, go ahead.
###1637 So I take it out and I just, like, started.
###1639 And she was like, oh, god, no.
###1640 And I was like, oh, I'm so sorry.
###1641 I'm so sorry.
###1643 We'll never do it again.
###1643 I'm very sorry.
###1643 I want you to enjoy what we do.
###1645 Let's go get a falafel.
###1646 And she was like, [GRUNTS].
###1649 And she goes, no, you need to know what it was like.
###1652 And I was like, what it--
###1654 it seems awful.
###1656 I believe you.
###1657 She was like, no, you need to know.
###1658 And I was like, what does that mean?
###1659 I backed up against the wall.
###1661 I thought Navy SEALs were going to burst out of the
###1663 building and be like, time to learn.
###1665 And so, anyway, what she did is, she went to her dresser
###1669 and she got just a tiny little vibrator, a wee little
###1671 itsy-bitsy one, a tiny one like you'd use on the bus,
###1676 like nothing.
###1678 So then we started messing around again.
###1680 And then she took it and touched it to my surprisingly
###1683 cute little butthole, and then she went, push.
###1684 And I immediately was like throwing up, almost, sobbing,
###1690 racked with sobs.
###1692 So anyway, I get it.
###1694 I understand that there are people in the world who don't
###1696 want a big hard penis going in out of their butthole, and I'm
###1699 among them.
###1699 I am one of those people.
###1701 So I'm just saying you're the boss of your own butthole, OK?
###1704 Remember that.
###1705 So if your boyfriend is like, it's Arbor Day, be like, N. So
###1710 you don't have to let him to do it.
###1713 Look, if you want me to fuck you in your butt, I'll fuck
###1714 you in your butt.
###1714 I'm not a monster.
###1716 But I'm saying you're the boss of your butt.
###1720 You decide what goes in and out of there.
###1722 
###1726 Another thing for you youngsters out there, that
###1729 same older brother--
###1730 the friend's older brother who I called and had to get the
###1732 coordinates for the cigar box to dig up the porn-- he also
###1735 taught us what blow jobs were.
###1737 He didn't do a tutelage session, but he mentioned that
###1740 he got a blow job.
###1741 And we were like, what's that?
###1742 He's like, when the penis goes.
###1743 And I was like, shut up.
###1744 I want one.
###1745 And so anyway, he was like, yeah but they got to swallow.
###1750 They can't spit.
###1751 And I was like, what does that matter?
###1753 And he was like, [GRUNTS].
###1755 Anyway, decades later, finally a Samaritan put my penis in
###1759 her mouth, and I realized that if you suck my
###1761 dick, you're a hero.
###1762 You can take it, you can spit it in your hand, and you can
###1765 break my jaw, and I will drive to the florist--
###1769 I'll get my jaw wired shut-- buy you flowers, come, and be
###1771 like, thank you so much.
###1772 I love you.
###1773 Spit, swallow, it's up to you.
###1775 I don't care.
###1775 I mean literally, you could suck my dick, and then when
###1778 you're done you could peel off an expensive "Mission
###1780 Impossible" style mask and reveal that you're not a
###1782 beautiful young woman, you're Pat Sajak from "Wheel of
###1783 Fortune." And I would like, Pat, let
###1786 me take you to brunch.
###1787 I'm Rob Delaney.
###1788 Thank you very much.
###1789 
###1791 ROVE MCMANUS: Rob Delaney, the king of regular
###1798 penis-vagina sex.
###1799 
###1803 Another thing I need to point out to you is, when I first
###1805 arrived here--
###1807 I think this is going very well tonight, by the way.
###1809 Don't you think?
###1811 It's really cool to get asked to do something like this,
###1816 especially because when I first arrived here in Los
###1819 Angeles, Hollywood itself, they said if you want to make
###1822 it in this town, you're going to have to sleep
###1824 your way to the top.
###1827 I did that.
###1829 But the problem was, no one told me it had to be with
###1832 someone in the industry who can further your career.
###1837 So I just ended up nailing some
###1839 homeless guy in an alleyway.
###1841 But to his credit, he said he would put some calls in, so.
###1846 Although, it was a banana he had in his hand at the time.
###1849 So anyway, the night is still young.
###1850 Fingers crossed.
###1852 Ladies and gentlemen, our next performer.
###1854 Please welcome him now, one of the best, Mr. Jeremy Hotz.
###1857 
###1864 JEREMY HOTZ: Hi.
###1864 Thank you.
###1866 Thanks.
###1867 OK, stop.
###1868 Hi, how are you?
###1871 This is my face.
###1874 Sorry.
###1876 It's just we can't all be good looking, but I still have the
###1879 odd sexual experience.
###1883 This is my lucky shirt.
###1886 Do you know what that means?
###1887 I got laid while I was wearing this shirt.
###1890 And she loved this shirt because when we were doing it,
###1892 she said, whatever you do, don't take off that shirt.
###1895 
###1900 I like women.
###1900 They're way better-looking than us.
###1904 They are.
###1904 But everything in the world's designed to
###1906 make them even more.
###1907 We can't compete.
###1907 You're a good-looking guy, but this is the best you're ever
###1910 going to look.
###1912 Look at her, man.
###1914 Because women wear the makeup, and they're already pretty.
###1916 You can't wear makeup.
###1918 Did you ever see a woman without her makeup for the
###1920 first time and just think, who the fuck is that guy?
###1923 
###1930 See, even the women have to give me that one because
###1934 they've all seen one of their friends and thought, Jane's
###1936 looking a lot like Dave lately.
###1938 This is ridiculous.
###1939 
###1941 Women cheat, man.
###1942 Their underwear is way better than ours.
###1944 It is.
###1945 Are you a boob man or an ass man?
###1947 AUDIENCE: I like both.
###1948 JEREMY HOTZ: You like both, you greedy bastard?
###1950 
###1953 Leave some for somebody else.
###1956 He likes both.
###1959 You ever been startled by boobs?
###1960 You've been fooled haven't you?
###1961 Oh yeah, because you see giant boobs on a woman and then she
###1965 takes off her bra and it's two little gingerbread man eyes
###1968 staring at you.
###1969 
###1971 You think, shit, I've been had.
###1973 
###1976 It's true.
###1977 Women have underwear that fixes stuff.
###1979 Victoria's Secret should just be called "Lies."
###1985 Our underwear is garbage, isn't it?
###1988 It comes with a fly for no apparent reason.
###1992 Ladies, we don't use the fly.
###1994 We pull it down and flip it over the top.
###1996 And if we're at a urinal and the guy next to us is using
###2001 his fly, we punch him in the fucking face.
###2003 
###2010 But it's not all gloom and doom.
###2012 I'm just saying, ladies, if you've got a guy that loves
###2014 you, stay with him because he's trying, isn't he?
###2016 Seriously, it's gross, man.
###2018 We know it's tough to be a woman, it really is.
###2020 You have the period.
###2021 Good lord.
###2024 You just bleed.
###2025 You don't fall down or nothing.
###2027 It just happens.
###2029 
###2032 But we didn't invent it, so quit fucking yelling at us.
###2035 
###2045 And we have balls.
###2046 They're not particularly attractive.
###2048 Come on, ladies, you don't like balls.
###2051 You don't.
###2052 You're like, I'll deal with that long thing, but I don't
###2056 want those bouncing all over my forehead.
###2058 
###2062 These are nasty, aren't they?
###2065 If it was reversed, ladies, and you had balls, you
###2067 couldn't handle it.
###2069 It'd be like carrying a purse that never
###2071 matched your outfit.
###2072 
###2075 They're horrible.
###2078 Do you know this, ladies?
###2079 We have the unique ability of being able to
###2080 sit on our own balls.
###2082 Do you know this?
###2083 Your guy'll never tell you that.
###2086 You just see this look on his face at a restaurant.
###2087 
###2093 What happened?
###2094 I don't want to talk about it.
###2097 Tell me.
###2098 I sat on my ball, are you satisfied?
###2102 Sat on your ball?
###2103 That's ridiculous.
###2105 How fucking uncoordinated are you?
###2107 
###2113 I'm just saying, they're nasty, man.
###2116 You gotta find the right person who puts up with your
###2118 bullshit, man.
###2119 You can't live your whole life by yourself.
###2121 You don't want to die alone.
###2122 Get a dog like I did, man.
###2124 Seriously, check it out.
###2126 Here he is.
###2127 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
###2128 He's 17.
###2129 I rescued him.
###2130 I got him out of someone's backyard.
###2132 
###2137 I just opened a fence, picked him up, and ran
###2140 away like an asshole.
###2142 I took him to Petco to be groomed.
###2144 What a shit place that is.
###2146 I said a trim.
###2147 They shaved him almost totally bald.
###2150 He comes waddling out, I don't even recognize him.
###2153 But I took him because he seemed to know me.
###2156 
###2159 You know how embarrassing it is walking a bald dog in my
###2162 neighborhood?
###2163 Cats try and fuck him.
###2165 
###2168 I'm not a big cat guy.
###2169 I don't like them.
###2171 You never buy a cat, do you?
###2173 They just show up on your stoop, and you hear, [YOWLS].
###2178 You're like maybe I better let it in.
###2182 Thus begins a 25 year commitment with the most
###2187 standoffish bullshit animal on the face of the planet.
###2191 You ever call your cat?
###2192 Oh, yeah, they're right on it.
###2196 They get up and walk in the complete opposite direction,
###2199 lift their tail, and show you their asshole.
###2203 How rude is that?
###2205 I feed you, you miserable animal.
###2209 Don't flip me off with your hole, gee.
###2213 Just get a dog, man.
###2214 Dogs are the best.
###2215 He's 17 now, man, like I said.
###2217 You never know.
###2218 If you've got an old dog, you don't know.
###2220 They go old like your grandpa.
###2221 Your grandpa's nuts, right?
###2224 OK, let me explain it.
###2226 You ever see your grandpa just staring at the wall?
###2230 Your mom comes downstairs and goes, leave grandpa alone.
###2234 The TV used to be on that wall.
###2236 
###2239 That's the way your dog is.
###2242 He sleeps so soundly, man.
###2244 I poke him, and if he opens his eyes, I go, well, I guess
###2246 we're going for a walk right now.
###2249 Because he's old, man.
###2251 He's so old.
###2252 But dogs are fantastic, man.
###2254 Listen, honestly speaking, are you guys dating?
###2257 Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah.
###2258 And you love her, right?
###2260 Do you have a dog?
###2261 AUDIENCE: We don't.
###2261 JEREMY HOTZ: You don't.
###2262 Man, have you ever had a dog in your life?
###2263 Yeah, yeah.
###2264 Remember when you used to go outside and the dog would lie
###2267 by the door until you fucking came home?
###2270 She has never done that.
###2272 
###2277 And if she does, get the hell out of that relationship.
###2281 You were great.
###2281 Thank you so much.
###2283 
###2286 CAT: Great to be here, everybody.
###2287 As you know, my name is Professor Boyfriend.
###2289 
###2293 Hey, what do you want?
###2294 My owner's a lonely fat chick.
###2297 Oh, what are you guys aww-ing?
###2299 You're not the ones who have to sit in her lap.
###2300 
###2305 ROVE MCMANUS: Seriously, you're all
###2305 seeing that too, right?
###2306 That's not just me just going, wow, something just kicked in.
###2311 I'm going to give a press conference now.
###2315 I'm hoping each performer, as they come out now, are getting
###2318 more and more--
###2319 we've gone from microphones to stands.
###2322 The next person might have a podium.
###2324 And we just build a--
###2325 I don't know what.
###2326 Some huge-- it'll be like Best Buy at the end of this, but
###2330 with people in here.
###2333 Aww, what?
###2334 Best Buy, what have they done to anybody?
###2336 Nothing.
###2336 They've given us wonderful audio-visual memories for
###2339 years, and then I just feel the need to kick them for no
###2340 apparent reason.
###2341 Hey, look at that thing!
###2342 We're back.
###2344 Ladies and gentlemen, our next performer, you may know him
###2347 from the wonderful sketch group Dead Kevin.
###2350 Any Dead Kevin fans in the house?
###2353 Even just fans of people who hate a guy called Kevin and
###2356 love that idea, ladies and gentlemen, please welcome
###2358 Ahmed Bharoocha.
###2359 
###2370 AHMED BHAROOCHA: Thanks, guys.
###2370 Keep it going for Rove, everybody.
###2372 
###2376 He took the mic stand back.
###2380 It's BYO mic stand.
###2382 
###2384 This is crazy.
###2385 YouTube is becoming like television now.
###2388 The only difference is, they still give the opportunity to
###2390 the viewer at home to attach their hateful thoughts to the
###2393 bottom of this video.
###2396 Parents, read your children's YouTube comments.
###2399 
###2402 Recently, I went to a bar and I went to the bathroom.
###2406 In the bathroom, they had two urinals.
###2409 One of the urinals was filled with ice, which I thought was
###2413 kind of weird, so I went to the other urinal.
###2418 And as I was going to the bathroom, I started
###2423 looking at that ice.
###2426 I was like, hmm.
###2429 It would be really fun to melt that ice.
###2431 
###2434 So I stopped myself, went over to the other urinal, and I
###2438 started melting the ice.
###2439 And I thought I was alone, but a voice just comes from the
###2443 stall and he's like, couldn't resist the ice, could you?
###2446 
###2451 I was like, who is that?
###2453 What kind of perverted science experiment
###2455 did I just walk into?
###2457 He's like, that's three for ice.
###2458 
###2461 I feel like it's not cool to like things anymore.
###2464 You can't enjoy anything.
###2466 You have to like everything ironically or hate it.
###2469 The cool people, like hipsters, hipsters have become
###2473 the two old guys from the Muppets.
###2475 
###2478 At first glance, you're like, wow, these guys really hate
###2481 the Muppets.
###2483 But then on closer inspection, you're like, hey, these guys
###2486 bought season tickets to the Muppets.
###2490 They keep coming back.
###2493 [IMPERSONATING STATLER AND WALDORF]
###2493 Why do we keep coming here?
###2494 Because we're dead inside.
###2496 
###2500 I basically grew up in your typical
###2501 all-American household.
###2503 My mother's an Irish Catholic woman, my father is a
###2506 Pakistani Muslim.
###2507 
###2512 See you guys later.
###2515 You know, baseball, apple pie, gulab jamun, things like that.
###2520 A lot of people ask if my parents fought because of
###2522 their religions, different religions.
###2524 They didn't fight because they loved each other.
###2526 It's crazy to fight over religion.
###2528 You can't prove who's right.
###2530 Every religion has the same credentials.
###2532 It's like, how do you know your religion's right?
###2534 Oh, it says it in this book.
###2535 But it says it in my book.
###2536 Yeah, but my book says your book's not true.
###2539 So does my book.
###2542 But my dad told me my book was true.
###2543 But so did my dad.
###2546 It's just a guess, just a guess.
###2548 But it's the only guess that people will
###2551 murder each other over.
###2553 There's no one killing each other over how many jelly
###2556 beans are in a jar.
###2558 We say it's 67.
###2559 We say it's 87.
###2561 52.
###2562 It's all part of the same jelly bean.
###2564 We think the jelly bean hates gay people.
###2568 There is no jelly bean.
###2569 There might be a jelly bean.
###2570 I'm a jelly bean.
###2572 Let's kill him.
###2574 We're all jelly beans.
###2576 Let's kill ourselves.
###2578 I think the jelly bean's a woman.
###2579 That's ridiculous.
###2580 Who said that?
###2580 Yeah, shut the hell up.
###2581 
###2584 I found out that there's people that
###2586 don't believe in dinosaurs.
###2588 They think that the devil put dinosaur bones in the
###2593 earth to trick us.
###2596 
###2599 That is the lamest, nerdiest devil ever.
###2607 Is this just some science fiction nerd devil?
###2610 Like, hey Lucifer.
###2611 What's on the agenda for tonight?
###2613 Murder, genocide, plague?
###2616 Ah, no.
###2617 
###2620 Actually a much more diabolical scheme.
###2624 I've created a prehistoric reptilian species.
###2628 I'm going to take their bones and bury them deep down in the
###2631 earth, as to suggest an alternate
###2634 timeline than in the Bible.
###2637 And then we'll hope that one day, someone comes along, digs
###2645 them up, and questions God's existence.
###2648 
###2651 Huh?
###2652 
###2655 And if that doesn't work, we still have the gays.
###2659 Hey, guys, you've been fantastic.
###2660 Thank you very much.
###2661 
###2670 ROVE MCMANUS: Another round of applause for Ahmed, everybody.
###2672 I'm collecting the set.
###2673 I'm collecting the set.
###2674 
###2678 Seriously, one day, we will look back at this moment when
###2683 there are no microphones left in the world, and I'll be
###2686 sitting here laughing, going, they all said I was mad!
###2690 Who is laughing now?
###2691 Me, with my booming voice!
###2694 Ladies and gentlemen, it is indeed a pleasure to welcome
###2697 our next performer on the stage.
###2698 Not only a very gifted stand-up comedian, but one of
###2701 the stars of one of my favorite shows on television,
###2704 "Parks and Recreation." Ladies and gentlemen,
###2706 give it up for Retta.
###2707 
###2720 RETTA: Hi.
###2723 How's everybody doing?
###2726 So I'm the black girl.
###2730 It's OK, I'm used to it.
###2732 I've been this way a long fucking time.
###2736 So I'm here to talk about race.
###2740 That's cool.
###2740 We're all a little racist.
###2743 What I can't stand is when people are boldly racist.
###2746 I prefer old school racism, where you talk shit about me
###2749 behind my back or behind closed doors.
###2753 Now, old school racism is not to be confused with
###2756 old-fashioned racism, OK?
###2759 These are two very different things.
###2762 Old school racism is passive, while old-fashioned racism, a
###2766 lot more aggressive.
###2768 A lot more in your face.
###2769 It was all the rage in the '50s and '60s with its
###2771 high-powered fire hoses and its public hangings.
###2775 Yeah.
###2776 That's the kind of racism I don't prefer because, quite
###2778 frankly, I don't like to get my hair wet.
###2780 
###2782 So I accept that we're all a little racist, and I include
###2786 myself in that.
###2787 I still make generalizations about you people.
###2791 For example, I still believe that white people can't really
###2794 feel cold, which is why you can wear shorts and flip-flops
###2800 in 40 degree weather.
###2802 As a black woman who turns on her heat in September, I find
###2806 this to be a bit peculiar.
###2808 But as an old school racist, I keep that shit to myself.
###2814 It's only during high-stress situations that I find that my
###2819 racism rears its ugly head.
###2821 Like when I've been in line at the DMV for an hour and the
###2825 blonde in front of me insists on flipping her hair forward
###2828 and back, forward and back until it brushes across my
###2831 face and sticks to my lip gloss.
###2835 That is a situation where a white girl might find herself
###2838 getting snatched by a black woman.
###2839 
###2843 Or at the airport when the ticket agent announces that
###2847 they will begin boarding first class and the executive
###2850 platinum frequent flyer business traveler bumps and
###2853 pushes past me because he assumes I'm flying animal
###2856 class with rest of the plebs.
###2859 Excuse you, John J McAllister the Third.
###2862 I'm assigned to seat 2D, bitch.
###2864 Recognize.
###2866 
###2873 But my racism is most evident when I'm driving because I
###2879 have an obscene and unrelenting case of road rage.
###2883 I am what you might call a psycho bitch behind the wheel,
###2887 who's also a little racist.
###2889 But I'm here to tell you that it is a new-- what-- fucking
###2892 day, people.
###2892 It is a new fucking day.
###2895 Because I was in my car, headed towards a light,
###2898 towards an intersection.
###2899 Now, there's another young lady headed towards--
###2902 I'm traveling east to west.
###2904 She's traveling north to south.
###2905 Now she, too, would like to move east to west.
###2909 So my light is about to turn yellow, so all she has to do
###2913 is wait 10 seconds for the right of way.
###2916 But instead of waiting the 10 seconds for her rightful turn,
###2920 she takes it upon herself to risk my life and property by
###2924 gunning it and making the turn just as I enter the
###2927 intersection.
###2929 This little entitled bitch--
###2932 I think at this point we all know what
###2933 I was really thinking--
###2935 this little entitled white bitch cuts me off.
###2939 So I immediately go to my "angry black woman who has no
###2942 patience for entitled white bitches" place, right?
###2945 So now I'm about to gun it so I can pull up next to her and
###2948 give her the "bitch, do you know who the fuck you just cut
###2950 off?" face, right?
###2953 
###2955 I am looking to intimidate the shit out of her when I notice
###2960 that she's got an Obama hope sticker on her bumper.
###2965 And that's when I said, you know what?
###2967 I'm going to let this one go.
###2968 
###2971 Yeah.
###2972 
###2975 I'm going to give you a pass on this one, Marcy, because it
###2978 is a new-- what-- fucking day.
###2980 Just know that this type of shit did not fly during the
###2982 Bush administration.
###2983 Yeah, I'd have lit your ass up.
###2986 Know this.
###2988 Because normally I'd want to strangle this trick, but it
###2992 was the Obama hope sticker that convinced me to Barack
###2994 the choke and let that bitch go.
###2996 That's my time.
###2997 Thank you guys for paying attention.
###3001 ROVE MCMANUS: To Retta.
###3002 
###3006 Oh, she's going to take it.
###3008 That's professional.
###3009 That's professional.
###3010 Let any aspiring comics out there, either in the room or
###3014 watching this at home right now, whenever you leave
###3016 anywhere, take your microphone stand with you.
###3018 What were you doing with a microphone stand there the
###3020 first place?
###3022 You need to question your attitude.
###3023 Ladies and gentlemen, our final performer of the
###3026 evening, are you ready?
###3029 Are you ready?
###3031 Oh my god, one of my favorites, the host of one of
###3034 my favorite podcasts, "Walking the Room," ladies and
###3036 gentlemen, Greg Behrendt.
###3038 
###3046 GREG BEHRENDT: Hello, hello, hello, hello.
###3048 Nice to see you.
###3050 Wow, this is exciting, guys.
###3053 Top line in the old YouTube show, shit, at 50?
###3056 That shit is awesome.
###3056 Yeah, I'm 50 years old.
###3058 Well, you look awesome.
###3058 Yeah, I fucking iron my neck.
###3061 I look amazing, man.
###3064 I've had a pretty good career.
###3064 I've made some mistakes.
###3065 I'm not going to lie to you.
###3066 I had an audition for "Saturday
###3067 Night Live" years ago.
###3068 When I say audition, it didn't happen.
###3069 I was standing outside 30 Rock doing an imitation that I do.
###3074 I do voices, I do characters.
###3075 Yeah.
###3076 I've hid that, but I do them.
###3078 I do characters pretty good, Bill Cosby
###3080 explaining the Holocaust.
###3082 
###3085 They put the Jews on the train.
###3086 Like, it's not a great imitation, but HoloCosby is an
###3090 awesome t-shirt.
###3091 
###3095 I'm going to make that t-shirt later, if I feel like it, put
###3098 that little Michael Jordan mustache on him.
###3101 He's got the patent on that now.
###3102 How are you guys?
###3103 This is really--
###3104 [AUDIENCE CHEERING]
###3105 GREG BEHRENDT: I mean, it's dope.
###3107 
###3111 This is exciting.
###3112 I've had a pretty good life.
###3113 I have a family.
###3114 I've got a beautiful--
###3116 two daughters, beautiful.
###3119 One of them's nice, daughters.
###3122 Not nice, they're both nice, just one likes me.
###3124 The other one doesn't like--
###3125 the younger.
###3125 The older one likes me.
###3127 11, she likes me.
###3128 The older daughter likes me a lot.
###3130 Like, she thinks I'm the sun and moon.
###3132 She really--
###3133 well, she's not a genius, either.
###3134 She's not a bright person.
###3136 Doesn't make her a bad person, she's just not a genius.
###3138 As a parent, I wouldn't be a good guy if I pretended she
###3141 was smarter.
###3142 She's going to be the president of nothing.
###3143 That doesn't make her not--
###3145 she's lovely.
###3146 She's a lovely person.
###3147 Do you know what she wanted for her 11th birthday?
###3148 You know what's at the top of her list?
###3149 She wanted a hug.
###3151 How about that?
###3152 You know what her second favorite thing in
###3153 the whole world is?
###3153 Cartwheels.
###3154 If she could cartwheel into a hug, she
###3156 would turn into a rainbow.
###3157 
###3160 She's just not a genius, that's all.
###3161 She's not a thinker, that's all.
###3162 She's just not a person who puts things together.
###3165 Let me give you an example, just so you don't think I'm
###3166 being a dick.
###3168 We're on an airplane.
###3169 She has a 7-Up in a can.
###3171 Flight attendant comes over and says, would you like to
###3173 have a cup of ice with that?
###3175 She says, yes, I would.
###3176 Flight attendant puts down a cup of ice.
###3178 My daughter looks at the cup, looks at the can, and
###3181 takes a cube and--
###3182 she's really pretty.
###3183 Like, she's super--
###3185 she's gorgeous.
###3186 She's a very, very pretty-- she's just not a thinker.
###3189 
###3191 Now let me explain my younger one to you.
###3193 She's more complex.
###3195 She's seven.
###3197 She has an imaginary friend that hates her.
###3201 
###3203 Hang on.
###3204 And she don't give a fuck.
###3208 How weird is that?
###3209 She has a friend that she made up with her mind that
###3212 doesn't like her.
###3212 And she's like, go fuck yourself.
###3214 She already knows human beings are going to be disappointing.
###3218 She was walking through the house the other day on an
###3220 imaginary phone like this, not talking.
###3221 I go, what are you doing?
###3222 She goes, I'm on hold.
###3224 That's weird.
###3225 
###3232 And the other one is really--
###3233 I'm not comparing them because they're both lovely.
###3235 They're both beautiful.
###3236 But the other one sort of fell out of my wife's vagina with
###3238 big brown hair and beestung lips and beautiful eyes.
###3242 And the little one came out with the-- you know like when
###3244 the babies have hair--
###3245 barely any, like you've got to push all three together and
###3247 put a bow in it so that everyone
###3248 knows, oh, it's a chick.
###3250 Like, it's not a chick, but you have to do that.
###3251 And then she has no depth perception, so she had to have
###3254 these glasses.
###3255 And then all of her teeth came through one hole at the front,
###3258 so she has to have this thing called an expander where you
###3259 have to twist--
###3261 it's like an iron maiden for your mouth.
###3263 And you put a key in there and turn it at night so that her
###3265 teeth spread.
###3266 And then we've given her a lisp.
###3268 She didn't have a lisp, but we put plastic in our mouth so
###3271 now she talks.
###3272 It just has to be like this, she doesn't have a choice.
###3274 And then when she's done talking, she has to go and
###3277 suck it back in because her mouth is filled with spit.
###3279 How about that?
###3279 Seven.
###3280 Maybe she's cynical.
###3283 She's kind of a punk.
###3284 I walked past her room the other day.
###3285 She was talking to her friend, telling what I did for living,
###3287 and she goes, yeah, I think he's a clown.
###3288 First off, you're right.
###3292 
###3296 But they take care of each other.
###3297 That's the kind of cool thing, because the older one, she's
###3300 excited by outside.
###3301 Like, oh my god, outdoors.
###3303 Everything is exciting to her.
###3304 And the younger one is cynical.
###3307 They'll date at some point, which will be exciting but
###3309 weird at the same time.
###3310 Because I live in a house with just girls.
###3311 There's just nothing but vagina at my house.
###3314 I don't have it in boxes.
###3314 What I'm saying is that there's a lot
###3318 of women in my house.
###3320 And I'll probably be psyched when they start dating, you
###3322 know what I mean?
###3322 I'll probably freak the dude out that comes over because
###3324 I'll be excited there's a man in the house, do
###3326 you know what I mean?
###3328 He'll knock on the door with his fucking face.
###3329 And I'll be like, get in here!
###3330 What do you want to do?
###3331 Jerk off?
###3331 Watch a game?
###3332 Put a Tapout shirt on?
###3333 We can do that.
###3335 Hang on, my muffins are ready.
###3336 And then I'll go to get muffins and
###3338 explain my apron to him.
###3340 The point is.
###3341 
###3345 And then the older one will--
###3346 she'll date, and she'll get her heart broken because she's
###3348 open hearted.
###3349 And she'll give her heart to a dude, and he'll
###3351 fucking fuck it up.
###3354 But then she'll have her little sister there to take
###3355 care of her, to watch out for her.
###3358 And I sort of like to imagine the scene, like a John Hughes
###3361 type movie where they're at high school together because
###3364 they're only three years apart.
###3366 True, that's my older daughter, she gets her heart
###3368 broken and she runs off down the hall, crying.
###3370 And then she goes to the bathroom and she's in tears.
###3372 But then she notices her reflection in the mirror, and
###3374 she's delighted by reflections.
###3375 
###3388 And then my little one will just walk over to this dude
###3390 that's standing by the locker, put out her cigarette, and go,
###3399 [LISPING]
###3399 if you fuck with my sister again, fuck with my sister
###3405 again, I will kill you.
###3407 My imaginary friends hate me.
###3410 [SUCKING UP SALIVA]
###3411 My name's Greg Behrendt.
###3412 Thank you all very much.
###3413 
###3417 ROVE MCMANUS: Greg Behrendt!

###3427 That is our show.
###3427 Did you enjoy yourselves?
###3430 Yeah, you did.
###3431 It was free.
###3433 And for you at home it was free, too, unless you pay

###3439 that make no sense.

###3445 This time tomorrow there will be live improv, thank you to
