###3 And no one to manage the land.
###15 Spanish explorers invade the Americas
###18 and bring with them the horse.
###20 First brought to the Caribbean islands,
###22 these animals reproduce and spread in the new world
###25 as fast as the wind.
###31 Horses have not been seen here since the Ice Age.
###36 Now they're back.
###41 It's as though the landscape has been waiting for them.
###51 Once ashore a few horses run wild.
###54 A new breed evolves,
###56 which soon takes over North America: the Mustang.
###67 Within three hundred years they had reached the central plains and the Rocky Mountains.
###76 At the end of the eighteenth century
###78 the Mustang makes it as far as Canada.
###86 One hundred and fifty years later
###88 there may be seven million wild horses in North America.
###116 For the nomadic tribes like the Black Foot Cheyenne,
###119 Sioux and Comanche of the central plains
###122 these wild horses are a blessing.
###130 What they used to do on foot
###132 fighting, hunting, travelling,
###134 they can now do on the backs of wild horses from Europe.
###140 It transforms their lives.
###154 This old world animal becomes the symbol of their native culture.
###157 Although the horse once came from across the Atlantic, it is now an image of nomadic America.
###183 As soon as the conquistadors have conquered South and Central America
###187 one of them heads north:
###194 Fernando de Soto
###196 travels from Florida up the Mississippi river.
###201 Looking for gold.
###214 The Spaniards leave death in their wake.
###217 And something else they bring along to keep them alive.
###236 As they journey through unknown jungles,
###238 the pigs help them survive.
###243 They are a perfect source of food.
###248 They don't take up much space in the boats.
###251 They look after themselves
###253 and they eat everything they can in this new continent.
###257 They're prolific little beasts.
###259 A healthy sow can give birth to ten piglets at a time.
###264 When the conquistadors leave some behind
###266 they will have an ever growing food supply for those who come after them.
###271 The pigs are key to their survival.
###279 But to native Americans
###281 they're a curse.
###287 In North America natives do not fence their fields
###290 and the staple crop of corn is irresistible.
###302 There is no evidence that native Americans know how to fight this plague of pigs.
###318 Soon European swine are eating the seeds and the young shoots.
###332 Only a few generations after running wild
###334 the animal becomes very different from the typical farm pig.
###340 It grows tusks and gets bigger and aggressive.
###344 What began with a few pigs
###345 becomes a daily nightmare for the native Americans.
###356 In addition to horses
###357 Columbus brought eight pigs to America on his second voyage.
###361 Within twenty years
###363 there are thirty thousand pigs on the island of Cuba alone.
###368 They multiply conquering the Andes, the Amazon and North America.
###378 But the Spaniard, his horse and his pig
###381 would never have been so successful in the conquest of the new world
###385 without a hidden passenger.
###392 It is when the old and new worlds touch that the native American meets his worst enemy.
###400 A very black ** for the continent.
###416 A Spanish missionary reports:
###419 "An epidemic broke up, a sickness of pustules
###423 large blobs spread on people.
###425 Some were entirely covered
###428 on the face, the head, the chest
###431 they lay in their dwellings and sleeping places no longer able to move or stir.
###437 The pustules caused great desolation,
###440 very many people died of them and many starved to death.
###446 No one's took care of others any longer.
###454 Deadly diseases contaminate both continents of the Americas.
###466 For the natives
###467 writes a chronicler.
###469 they are near all dead at the smallpox.
###472 so the Lord have cleared our title to what we possess."
###483 To this day
###484 scientists are still working to identify these diseases,
###491 to trace their paths
###494 and count the dead.
###502 Smallpox was accidentally introduced in the Americas in the sixteenth-century.
###506 The smallpox virus is very hearty. In blankets that are used by smallpox victims
###510 the scabs can live
###512 for weeks carrying the virus and smallpox can also pass from host to host
###517 on board a trans-atlantic vessel until it reaches the Americas. And of course
###522 once smallpox reached the Americas it was introduced to millions of new hosts,
###526 human hosts who had no acquired immunities to these diseases.
###531 And so smallpox together with measles and influenza had a devastating impact
###536 on native American populations.
###538 No one knows exactly what the mortality was. Conservative estimates are about 50%.
###544 It was probably closer to ninety percent or even higher.
###548 Through trade between native peoples
###551 diseases spread through the whole continent.
###554 Many natives die from diseases without ever seeing a European.
###560 Microbes move faster than the conquistadors who brought them.
###567 Some fifty years after Columbus first sets foot in the Americas
###572 conquistadors and explorers find neither towns nor people.
###577 No one stands in their way.
###580 Most of the people are dead
###582 and Nature reclaims the land.
###585 Everything that they now find is pure wilderness.
###590 A garden of Eden, without humans.
###599 A thousand different kinds of birds and beasts of the forests
###603 which have never been known
###605 neither in shape or name.
###610 "And ** there is no mention made
###613 neither among the latins or greeks or any other nations of the world".
###619 reports a Spanish missionary.
###624 It may be God has made a new creation of beasts".
###646 Explorers send exotic plants and animals, evidence of God's second creation
###652 on the ships back to Spain.
###664 Corn
###665 Chilean pumpkins,
###669 domesticated in the new world
###672 unknown in Europe.
###675 Tomatoes and potatoes.
###687 But there is an unwelcome passenger on board.
###691 An unintentional gift from the natives.
###696 It will lead to death in Europe.
###700 It was spread in the brothels, in the courts and cities of the old world.
###706 It will be painful.
###709 It drives its victims mad.
###714 And it can take a long long time to kill.
###722 This is the French pox,
###724 or the Spanish sickness,
###729 syphilis.
###737 Europeans have no idea
###740 that this disease came from America,
###743 where more and more are aching to go.
###750 In the seventeenth century a new wave of people heads to the new world: the settlers.
###757 England has defeated Spain to become a new European superpower.
###763 The English crown sets out to claim its share.
###774 In 1607 the British start a colony on the east coast of
###778 North America, in what is now Virginia.
###789 They name it Jamestown after their king.
###801 This will become
