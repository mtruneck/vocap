###25 SHANE SMITH: In Western mainstream media right now,
###27 we're hearing a lot about Islamic fundamentalism,
###30 nuclear proliferation, rogue states.
###33 And public enemy number one is Iran.
###37 BRET BAIER: The Iranians are moving forward with their
###39 nuclear program quicker than expected.
###42 -Iran's President is warning it is too late to stop Iran's
###45 nuclear program.
###47 -Iran basically has a strategy to dominate the region.
###49 DAN GILLERMAN: What I can tell you is that
###51 Iran must be stopped.
###53 SHANE SMITH: Now, it's interesting to us that on one
###55 hand you have footage like this from Fox News saying that
###58 Iran is an imminent threat.
###59 But on the other hand, you have all these films coming
###61 out where critics are saying, hey, these are some of the
###64 best films coming out right now.
###65 They're beautiful, they're amazing, they're great.
###67 So how is it that we have on one side an Islamic
###69 fundamentalist state, but on the other all
###71 these amazing movies?
###73 We had to go to Iran and find out the truth
###75 behind Iranian cinema.
###77 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###89 SHANE SMITH: Now, getting into Iran as a journalist is nearly
###91 impossible.
###92 They have a very bad reputation with journalists.
###95 Many have been arrested, a lot have been tortured, and some
###97 have even been killed.
###98 In fact, there's a World Press Freedom Index, and Iran is
###102 number 166.
###103 Right at the back of the bus with only the worst offenders
###106 like Turkmenistan, North Korea, Eritrea and
###108 Cuba ahead of it.
###110 Now what scared me personally about going into Iran as a
###112 journalist was that I knew two things.
###115 One is that Zahra Kazemi, a Canadian journalist who got
###118 into Iran, was kidnapped, raped, and
###120 beaten to death in 2003.
###122 And that our friend Ben Anderson from the BBC, who did
###125 "Holidays in the Axis of Evil," went in with a handycam
###127 and was kidnapped and tortured for a week before they kicked
###130 him out without his tapes.
###132 So we didn't want to go in with a handycam.
###134 And we didn't want to sneak in like we usually do.
###137 So we tried for about a year and a half to get into the
###139 country legitimately.
###140 And finally, the producers of the Third International Urban
###143 Film Festival got us our visas, arranged for us to be
###147 able to bring in the cameras, and did the impossible and got
###150 us into Iran.
###150 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###163 [POLICE HORN]
###164 SHANE SMITH: Uh oh.
###165 What was that?
###167 That was cops.
###169 -No.
###169 No, no, no.
###170 -No, no, no.
###171 Yeah, I know.
###172 SHANE SMITH: I don't know if we got that do-da-lu on thing,
###174 but if the cops see a camera, they can turn
###177 their bloopers on.
###180 We're waiting for permission to shoot outside, so we're
###182 shooting from the car, which we're not
###184 supposed to do either.
###185 -What'd he say?
###186 -Police.
###186 Police.
###187 SHANE SMITH: Why don't they want people shooting?
###190 -With your small camera, you don't have any problem.
###192 It's just the size of the camera that makes it
###194 professional as a journalist.
###195 When you have a big camera, you need to have permission.
###198 SHANE SMITH: Can I shoot with this guy around, or no?
###202 -It's better not to do it now.
###204 SHANE SMITH: We were told from the first day we got there
###207 that we weren't allowed to shoot anything that didn't
###209 have to do with film.
###211 And they warned us that we could be arrested if we shot
###213 anything that had to do with police, military or the
###215 government, which is basically everything in Iran.
###217 The only places we could really shoot freely were when
###220 we were indoors, or things that were directly sponsored
###222 by the Film Festival, and even then it wasn't easy.
###226 We're about to meet the coordinator of the Film
###229 Festival here.
###230 And on the way here, we were told that we're being watched.
###235 And they talk a lot about our beards.
###238 They want to know if we got beards just to come here and
###241 why we're dressed the way we are.
###243 Why we're so dressed up.
###244 But we were told to wear suits.
###247 So there's all kinds of undercurrents that we don't
###251 know anything about.
###252 So we're trying to be good baby boys
###254 and not get in trouble.
###257 So we were nervous.
###257 We were freaked out.
###259 We got there and he had a nice office.
###261 We sat down and it was kind of like talking to a super cool
###264 Omar Sharif or something.
###265 ALI REZA SHOJA-NOORI: Hello.
###265 SHANE SMITH: Hi.
###266 ALI REZA SHOJA-NOORI: How are you?
###266 SHANE SMITH: Good, how are you?
###268 ALI REZA SHOJA-NOORI: Fine.
###268 SHANE SMITH: Good to see you.
###270 ALI REZA SHOJA-NOORI: Thanks for dropping by.
###272 SHANE SMITH: Ali Reza Shoja-Noori was one of the
###275 guys who's responsible for taking Iranian cinema to all
###278 the film festivals during the '80s and '90s.
###281 ALI REZA SHOJA-NOORI: For myself, that I was promoting
###284 the Iranian films abroad.
###287 Then came the big question--
###290 do we have any place in the world?
###292 Is anyone waiting for our cinema?
###294 And the first film that we succeeded was "Frosty Roads."
###300 '86, I think-- '85, '86.
###301 It went to Berlin Film Festival.
###304 And when I saw the response of the audience there, I found
###310 out that yes, it's possible to do that.
###312 And then we went to do other films and other festivals.
###315 At that time we made one objective for us that we are
###319 going for a day that there would be no festival in the
###323 world without an Iranian film.
###325 And we got to that point.
###326 SHANE SMITH: Is there a big culture of
###328 going to the cinema?
###330 ALI REZA SHOJA-NOORI: Yes.
###330 SHANE SMITH: A big culture of going to watch movies?
###332 ALI REZA SHOJA-NOORI: Yes.
###333 The Iranian people like films very much.
###337 Very, very much.
###338 They like the school of their children and they like cinema.
###342 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###346 SHANE SMITH: The next place they took us was to Khaneh
###348 Cinema, or "The House of Iranian Cinema." And there we
###352 walked into kind of a really surreal situation.
###355 Because even though most American films are banned in
###357 Iran, they had invited the American Academy Awards people
###361 over for the first time in 35 years to exchange information
###365 on film and film festivals.
###366 So we walk into the building and the president of the
###369 Academy, Sid Ganis is over here.
###371 Oh, there's Annette Bening, who we had heard in the
###373 Western media before flying to Iran had been arrested.
###377 And forced to apologize to the Iranian people for the
###380 Hollywood propaganda of films like the "300," "The
###383 Wrestler," and "Not Without My Daughter."
###387 Meanwhile, we go to the House of Cinema and there they are.
###390 Everybody's having lunch together.
###391 There's no problems.
###392 Everybody really likes each other.
###394 This is going to get super weird.
###397 They're going to wonder who the hell we are.
###399 We're going to totally crash this lunch.
###402 He wants to ask what the fuck we're doing here.
###405 We just pretend to be Iranian.
###407 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###412 SHANE SMITH: So here they're just shooting around.
###414 And the Americans thought we were Iranian secret police.
###417 And the Iranians thought we just knew each other.
###419 -Let's go.
###422 SHANE SMITH: That was great.
###424 Before leaving the House of Cinema, we went downstairs to
###426 check out their filmmaker's library.
###428 And when we were there, we asked one of the board members
###430 what he thought about this whole apologizing business.
###433 -[SPEAKING PERSIAN]
###434 
###443 SHANE SMITH: So who asked them to apologize?
###445 -[SPEAKING PERSIAN]
###448 
###450 -[SPEAKING PERSIAN]
###451 
###466 SHANE SMITH: So that was our first freaky glimpse into how
###469 crazy and how much propaganda there is that surrounds
###472 everything about Iran.
