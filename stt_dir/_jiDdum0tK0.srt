0:0:34,3 --> 0:0:35,3

9
0:0:40,27 --> 0:0:41,3
HERE IN THE BRICK CITY.


10
0:0:41,3 --> 0:0:42,57
DITULLIO: YOU KNOW, SHELBY, OVER


11
0:0:42,57 --> 0:0:43,7
THE LAST TWO YEARS THE RIT MENS'


12
0:0:43,7 --> 0:0:45,13
HOCKEY TEAM EXPERIENCED A FEW


13
0:0:45,13 --> 0:0:46,57
MAJOR MILESTONES OF ITS OWN. TWO


14
0:0:46,57 --> 0:0:48,7
YEARS AGO THE TIGERS CLINCHED


15
0:0:48,7 --> 0:0:49,67
THEIR FIRST TRIP TO THE NCAA


16
0:0:49,67 --> 0:0:51,77
TOURNAMENT NAD REACHED THEIR


17
0:0:51,77 --> 0:0:53,3
FIRST FROZEN FOUR IN SCHOOL


18
0:0:53,3 --> 0:0:54,6
HISTORY. HILL: AS EMILY CLARK


19
0:0:54,6 --> 0:0:56,2
REPORTS, LAST SEASON A FORMER


20
0:0:56,2 --> 0:0:58,2
TIGER CONTINUED RIT'S STRING OF


21
0:0:58,2 --> 0:1:1,7
FIRSTS WHEN HE REACHED THE


22
0:1:1,7 --> 0:1:7,47
HIGHEST LEVEL IN HOCKEY. CLARK:


23
0:1:7,47 --> 0:1:9,37
LAST SEASON FORMER RIT HOCKEY


24
0:1:9,37 --> 0:1:11,57
PLAYER CHRIS TANEV WAS PRESENTED


25
0:1:11,57 --> 0:1:14,27
AN OPPORTUNITY MOST PLAYERS ONLY


26
0:1:14,27 --> 0:1:15,77
DREAM OF. AFTER LEAVING SCHOOL


27
0:1:15,77 --> 0:1:17,6
FOLLOWING HIS FRESHMAN YEAR,


28
0:1:17,6 --> 0:1:20,2
TANEV BRIEFLY TOOK THE ICE WITH


29
0:1:20,2 --> 0:1:22,3
THE AHL'S MANITOBA MOOSE, BEFORE


30
0:1:22,3 --> 0:1:24,7
RECEIVING A CALL UP TO THE NHL'S


31
0:1:24,7 --> 0:1:26,33
VANCOUVER CANUCKS. TANEV: IT WAS


32
0:1:26,33 --> 0:1:28,83
A LOT OF FUN. I WAS VERY EXCITED


33
0:1:28,83 --> 0:1:30,1
AND I HAD A BALL UP THERE. IT


34
0:1:30,1 --> 0:1:31,17
WAS A DREAM COME TRUE. CLARK:


35
0:1:31,17 --> 0:1:32,4
WHAT WAS IT LIKE PLAYING IN YOUR


36
0:1:32,4 --> 0:1:33,4
FIRST PRO GAME AND WHAT WAS


37
0:1:33,4 --> 0:1:35,0
RUNNING THROUGH YOUR MIND?


38
0:1:35,0 --> 0:1:36,33
TANEV: JUST TRYING NOT TO MAKE A


39
0:1:36,33 --> 0:1:37,77
MISTAKE OUT THERE AND JUST


40
0:1:37,77 --> 0:1:40,63
TRYING TO HAVE FUN AND ENJOY THE


41
0:1:40,63 --> 0:1:42,3
MOMENT. CLARK: BUT THE MOMENT


42
0:1:42,3 --> 0:1:43,6
AND THE GAME WERE CLEARLY


43
0:1:43,6 --> 0:1:46,1
DIFFERENT FROM HIS DAYS AT RIT.


44
0:1:46,1 --> 0:1:47,87
TANEV: THE GAMES ARE MORE


45
0:1:47,87 --> 0:1:49,63
CONTROLLED; THE GUYS ARE BIGGER.


46
0:1:49,63 --> 0:1:53,3
YOU HAVE TO PLAY YOUR POSITION


47
0:1:53,3 --> 0:1:55,8
BASICALLY TO A T AND NOT DEVIATE


48
0:1:55,8 --> 0:1:57,9
FROM THE GAME PLAN AND IT'S JUST


49
0:1:57,9 --> 0:2:2,3
A LITTLE BIT OF A STEP UP.


50
0:2:2,3 --> 0:2:3,3
CLARK: SO HOW DO YOU STAY SO


51
0:2:3,3 --> 0:2:5,4
FOCUSED AND SO CALM WITH ALL THE


52
0:2:5,4 --> 0:2:6,97
PRESSURE AND ATTENTION? TANEV:


53
0:2:6,97 --> 0:2:8,9
IT'S JUST HOW I PLAY AND DO


54
0:2:8,9 --> 0:2:10,27
NOTHING SPECIAL. IT'S HOW MY


55
0:2:10,27 --> 0:2:13,27
PERSONALITY IS AND I JUST TRY TO


56
0:2:13,27 --> 0:2:15,37
ENJOY THE GAME AND IT'S JUST


57
0:2:15,37 --> 0:2:17,43
HOCKEY WHEN YOU GET ON THE ICE.


58
0:2:17,43 --> 0:2:20,1
CLARK: TANEV PLAYED IN 29


59
0:2:20,1 --> 0:2:21,77
REGULAR SEASON GAMES. HE EVEN


60
0:2:21,77 --> 0:2:23,2
TOOK THE ICE IN THE PLAYOFFS AND


61
0:2:23,2 --> 0:2:25,7
CAME WITHIN ONE WIN OF HOCKEY'S


62
0:2:25,7 --> 0:2:27,87
TOP PRIZE, THE STANLEY CUP. SO


63
0:2:27,87 --> 0:2:29,77
HOW DIFFICULT IS IT TO GET TO


64
0:2:29,77 --> 0:2:30,93
THAT POINT IN THE STANLEY CUP


65
0:2:30,93 --> 0:2:32,0
FINALS? TANEV: IT'S VERY


66
0:2:32,0 --> 0:2:34,93
DIFFICULT. THERE ARE 32 TEAMS


67
0:2:34,93 --> 0:2:36,7
AND YOU PLAY 82 GAMES IN THE


68
0:2:36,7 --> 0:2:38,47
REGULAR SEASON AND THEN YOU'VE


69
0:2:38,47 --> 0:2:41,27
GOT TO WIN ANOTHER 16 TO WIN THE


70
0:2:41,27 --> 0:2:43,97
STANLEY CUP SO IT'S A LONG GRIND


71
0:2:43,97 --> 0:2:46,27
AND IT'S TOUGH ON YOUR BODY, BUT


72
0:2:46,27 --> 0:2:48,2
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE PLAYING, TO


73
0:2:48,2 --> 0:2:50,37
WIN THE STANLEY CUP AND WE CAME


74
0:2:50,37 --> 0:2:54,1
REAL CLOSE, BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE


75
0:2:54,1 --> 0:3:0,97
DIDN'T WIN. YOU OBVIOUSLY WANT


76
0:3:0,97 --> 0:3:3,73
TO WIN ONE OF THOSE LAST TWO


77
0:3:3,73 --> 0:3:5,3
GAMES AND WIN THE STANLEY CUP,


78
0:3:5,3 --> 0:3:6,83
BUT YOU TAKE IT AS A LEARNING


79
0:3:6,83 --> 0:3:8,4
EXPERIENCE AND AFTER A FEW DAYS


80
0:3:8,4 --> 0:3:10,1
PASS BY, IT'S SOMETHING YOU'LL


81
0:3:10,1 --> 0:3:11,37
ALWAYS REMEMBER BUT HOPEFULLY


82
0:3:11,37 --> 0:3:12,67
YOU'LL LEARN FROM IT AND GET


83
0:3:12,67 --> 0:3:14,1
THERE IN THE FUTURE AGAIN.


84
0:3:14,1 --> 0:3:15,57
CLARK: AS ONE OF THE YOUNGEST


85
0:3:15,57 --> 0:3:16,97
PLAYERS IN THE LEAGUE, TANEV IS


86
0:3:16,97 --> 0:3:18,6
HOPEFUL THIS IS JUST THE START


87
0:3:18,6 --> 0:3:21,23
OF WHAT HAS ALMOST FELT SURREAL.


88
0:3:21,23 --> 0:3:22,7
SO WHEN YOU TOOK YOUR FIRST STEP


89
0:3:22,7 --> 0:3:24,7
ON THE RIT CAMPUS, DID YOU EVER


90
0:3:24,7 --> 0:3:27,43
DREAM THAT EVERYTHING WOULD HAVE


91
0:3:27,43 --> 0:3:29,3
HAPPENED AS IT HAS HOCKEY WISE


92
0:3:29,3 --> 0:3:31,2
IN THE PAST YEAR FOR YOU? TANEV:


93
0:3:31,2 --> 0:3:33,43
NO, I DEFINITELY DIDN'T THINK IT


94
0:3:33,43 --> 0:3:34,67
WOULD HAPPEN. IT'S BEEN PRETTY


95
0:3:34,67 --> 0:3:38,7
CRAZY. IT'S BEEN A WILD RIDE AND


96
0:3:38,7 --> 0:3:39,7
HOPEFULLY I'LL IMPROVE MY GAME


97
0:3:39,7 --> 0:3:40,97
AND GET BETTER ON THE ICE.


98
0:3:40,97 --> 0:3:42,7
CLARK: THE CANUCKS MANAGEMENT


99
0:3:42,7 --> 0:3:43,37
TALK SO HIGHLY OF YOU; DO YOU


100
0:3:43,37 --> 0:3:44,73
EXPECT TO BE STARTING WITH THEM


101
0:3:44,73 --> 0:3:47,0
NEXT SEASON OR BACK IN THE AHL?


102
0:3:47,0 --> 0:3:48,27
TANEV: I'M JUST GOING TO BE


103
0:3:48,27 --> 0:3:49,57
WORKING HARD ALL SUMMER, GET TO


104
0:3:49,57 --> 0:3:50,93
TRAINING CAMP AND DO MY BEST OUT


105
0:3:50,93 --> 0:3:52,97
THERE. I'M GOING TO TRY AND MAKE


106
0:3:52,97 --> 0:3:54,6
THE BIG CLUB AND HOPEFULLY I DO,


107
0:3:54,6 --> 0:3:57,17
BUT IF I DON'T, THAT'S FINE. I


108
0:3:57,17 --> 0:3:59,4
DEFINITELY NEED TO GET STRONGER,


109
0:3:59,4 --> 0:4:0,83
DEFINITELY NEED TO IMPROVE MY


110
0:4:0,83 --> 0:4:3,9
SHOT AND THERE'S DEFINITELY


111
0:4:3,9 --> 0:4:6,47
PARTS OF MY GAME THAT I NEED TO


112
0:4:6,47 --> 0:4:7,73
IMPROVE A LOT TO BE THERE THE


113
0:4:7,73 --> 0:4:9,47
WHOLE YEAR OR BE THERE EVEN FOR


114
0:4:9,47 --> 0:4:12,9
A LITTLE BIT. HILL: IN ADDITION


115
0:4:12,9 --> 0:4:14,87
TO CHRIS TANEV, FOUR OTHER


116
0:4:14,87 --> 0:4:17,33
FORMER TIGERS WERE INVITED TO


117
0:4:17,33 --> 0:4:18,37
NHL TRAINING CAMPS THIS FALL.


118
0:4:18,37 --> 0:4:19,53
DITULLIO: STEVE (INAUDIBLE)


119
0:4:19,53 --> 0:4:20,57
JOINED TANEV IN CAMP WITH THE


120
0:4:20,57 --> 0:4:21,9
CANUCKS. TYLER BRENNER SKATED


121
0:4:21,9 --> 0:4:23,43
WITH THE TORONTO MAPLELEAFS,


122
0:4:23,43 --> 0:4:24,87
BOBBY RAYMOND WAS WITH OTTAWA,


123
0:4:24,87 --> 0:4:26,4
WHILE GOALTENDER JARED DEMICHAEL


124
0:4:26,4 --> 0:4:28,53
ATTENDED CAMP WITH THE DEFENDING


125
0:4:28,53 --> 0:4:32,4
STANLEY CUP CHAMPION BOSTON


126
0:4:32,4 --> 0:4:34,37
BRUINS. STILL TO COME ON


127
0:4:34,37 --> 0:4:36,6
SPORTSZONE: THREE RIT STUDENTS


128
0:4:36,6 --> 0:4:38,37
GO ON A JOURNEY OF A LIFETIME


129
0:4:38,37 --> 0:4:40,3
AND THE TIGERS EARN THE TOP SPOT


130
0:4:40,3 --> 0:4:42,7
BEFORE THE PUCK EVEN DROPS ON


131
0:4:42,7 --> 0:5:0,93
THE NEW SEASON. NEW SPEAKER:


132
0:5:0,93 --> 0:5:2,27
HOCKEY. DITULLIO: THE LAST FIVE


133
0:5:2,27 --> 0:5:4,6
SEASONS RIT AND AIR FORCE HAVE


134
0:5:4,6 --> 0:5:5,77
OWNED THE ATLANTIC HOCKEY


135
0:5:5,77 --> 0:5:7,17
ASSOCIATION SO IT SHOULD BE NO


136
0:5:7,17 --> 0:5:8,97
SURPRISE THAT THE DEFENDING


137
0:5:8,97 --> 0:5:10,23
REGULAR SEASON CHAMPION TIGERS


138
0:5:10,23 --> 0:5:11,63
AND TOURNAMENT CHAMPION FALCONS


139
0:5:11,63 --> 0:5:13,37
ARE ONCE AGAIN PICKED TO FINISH


140
0:5:13,37 --> 0:5:15,4
ATOP THE AHA STANDINGS. OUR VERY


141
0:5:15,4 --> 0:5:16,7
OWN SHELBY HILL CAUGHT UP WITH


142
0:5:16,7 --> 0:5:28,27
THE TIGERS AND PREVIEWS THE


143
0:5:28,27 --> 0:5:30,33
UPCOMING SEASON. HILL: LAST


144
0:5:30,33 --> 0:5:31,93
YEAR, HOW UPSETTING WAS IT TO


145
0:5:31,93 --> 0:5:33,17
WATCH AIR FORCE CONTINUE AND SEE


146
0:5:33,17 --> 0:5:34,97
YOUR SEASON KIND OF END


147
0:5:34,97 --> 0:5:36,7
ABRUPTLY? WILSON: THAT WAS


148
0:5:36,7 --> 0:5:37,57
REALLY DISAPPOINTING. SOME


149
0:5:37,57 --> 0:5:39,1
PEOPLE WERE ASKING IF IT STUNG,


150
0:5:39,1 --> 0:5:41,2
THE DEFEAT, BUT IT WAS JUST


151
0:5:41,2 --> 0:5:43,4
DISAPPOINTING WHENEVER YOUR LAST


152
0:5:43,4 --> 0:5:46,6
GAME ENDS WITH A LOSS, BUT


153
0:5:46,6 --> 0:5:47,87
HAVING SAID THAT, I WAS REALLY


154
0:5:47,87 --> 0:5:49,7
HAPPY WITH THE WAY WE PLAYED IN


155
0:5:49,7 --> 0:5:50,6
THAT PARTICULAR GAME. WE OUTSHOT


156
0:5:50,6 --> 0:5:52,63
THEM PRETTY BAD AND LOST ONE


157
0:5:52,63 --> 0:5:54,73
NOTHING. WE JUST COULDN'T SCORE


158
0:5:54,73 --> 0:5:56,2
A GOAL AND HAD A BIT OF A


159
0:5:56,2 --> 0:5:57,3
HANGOVER FROM THAT LOSS FOR A


160
0:5:57,3 --> 0:5:58,47
LITTLE BIT. NEW SPEAKER: THE


161
0:5:58,47 --> 0:5:59,63
FEELING AT THE END OF THE GAME


162
0:5:59,63 --> 0:6:1,77
LAST YEAR, LOSING ONE NOTHING IN


163
0:6:1,77 --> 0:6:3,93
FRONT OF OUR HOME CROWD AT BLUEN


164
0:6:3,93 --> 0:6:7,33
CROSS, IT'S JUST NOT A GREAT


165
0:6:7,33 --> 0:6:8,5
FEELING AT ALL AND IT'S HARD TO


166
0:6:8,5 --> 0:6:9,53
DESCRIBE. HILL: AND SO ARE YOU


167
0:6:9,53 --> 0:6:10,43
GOING TO USE THAT LOSS AS


168
0:6:10,43 --> 0:6:11,63
MOTIVATION FOR THIS YEAR? NEW


169
0:6:11,63 --> 0:6:13,3
SPEAKER: DEFINITELY. THEY'RE ONE


170
0:6:13,3 --> 0:6:14,9
OF THE TEAMS THAT WE LOOK TO


171
0:6:14,9 --> 0:6:16,27
BEAT EVERY YEAR AND THEY'RE ONE


172
0:6:16,27 --> 0:6:17,33
OF THE STRONGER TEAMS IN OUR


173
0:6:17,33 --> 0:6:18,63
DIVISION SO I MEAN, IT'S


174
0:6:18,63 --> 0:6:20,7
DEFINITELY GOING TO BE


175
0:6:20,7 --> 0:6:21,3
MOTIVATION AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN


176
0:6:21,3 --> 0:6:22,17
GET THE WIN BACK AND MAKE IT


177
0:6:22,17 --> 0:6:23,13
BACK TO THE TOURNAMENT. HILL:


178
0:6:23,13 --> 0:6:24,1
YOU LOST SOME PRETTY GREAT


179
0:6:24,1 --> 0:6:25,27
SENIORS LAST YEAR. HOW'S THE


180
0:6:25,27 --> 0:6:26,57
TEAM MAKING UP FOR THEM? NEW


181
0:6:26,57 --> 0:6:27,53
SPEAKER: JUST BRINGING IN A GOOD


182
0:6:27,53 --> 0:6:28,5
RECRUITING CLASS WITH THE


183
0:6:28,5 --> 0:6:30,37
FRESHMEN CLASS. FROM WHAT I'VE


184
0:6:30,37 --> 0:6:32,37
SEEN SO FAR, THEY CAN PLAY AT


185
0:6:32,37 --> 0:6:33,43
THE SAME LEVEL THAT OUR SENIORS


186
0:6:33,43 --> 0:6:35,3
HAVE PLAYED. WE'VE JUST GOT TO


187
0:6:35,3 --> 0:6:36,53
WAIT AND SEE WHO'S GOING TO STOP


188
0:6:36,53 --> 0:6:38,43
UP THIS YEAR AND WHO'S GOING TO


189
0:6:38,43 --> 0:6:40,13
SORT OF FILL THOSE ROLES OF LIKE


190
0:6:40,13 --> 0:6:42,27
FAVOT AND BRENNER AND THOSE TYPE


191
0:6:42,27 --> 0:6:43,83
OF PLAYERS. NEW SPEAKER: WE LOST


192
0:6:43,83 --> 0:6:45,13
OUR TOP TWO GOAL SCORERS AND


193
0:6:45,13 --> 0:6:46,97
POINT GETTERS, WE LOST OUR GREAT


194
0:6:46,97 --> 0:6:48,53
ROLE PLAYERS WITH SEAN MURPHY


195
0:6:48,53 --> 0:6:50,93
AND MIKE JANDA AND YANNI. JUST


196
0:6:50,93 --> 0:6:52,63
FIVE GREAT GUYS, ALWAYS IN THE


197
0:6:52,63 --> 0:6:54,0
LOCKER ROOM, THE LOUDEST AND


198
0:6:54,0 --> 0:6:55,57
MOST POSITIVE, SO IT'S GOING TO


199
0:6:55,57 --> 0:6:57,2
BE TOUGH TO REPLACE THEM, BUT I


200
0:6:57,2 --> 0:6:58,33
THINK MY SENIOR CLASS WILL DO A


201
0:6:58,33 --> 0:7:0,1
PRETTY GOOD JOB OF IT. HILL: SO


202
0:7:0,1 --> 0:7:1,83
CAN YOU TELL ME ABOUT THE


203
0:7:1,83 --> 0:7:3,3
FRESHMEN? WILSON: WELL, IT'S


204
0:7:3,3 --> 0:7:4,37
GOING TO BE INTERESTING HOW THEY


205
0:7:4,37 --> 0:7:6,1
ADAPT. WE'VE GOT STARTING IN


206
0:7:6,1 --> 0:7:9,67
GOAL JORDAN RUBY, THAT COMES IN


207
0:7:9,67 --> 0:7:10,6
VERY HIGHLY THOUGHT OF. WE


208
0:7:10,6 --> 0:7:11,77
CERTAINLY THINK A LOT OF HIM AND


209
0:7:11,77 --> 0:7:14,3
I THINK HE'S GOING TO CHALLENGE


210
0:7:14,3 --> 0:7:15,43
TWO GOALIES IN SHANE AND JOSH


211
0:7:15,43 --> 0:7:17,77
THAT HAVE REALLY DONE VERY WELL


212
0:7:17,77 --> 0:7:19,6
FOR US. ON DEFENSE, WE BROUGHT


213
0:7:19,6 --> 0:7:21,9
IN ONE DEFENSEMAN TO JOIN THE


214
0:7:21,9 --> 0:7:23,5
SEVEN THAT WE RETURNED, SO IT'S


215
0:7:23,5 --> 0:7:25,3
GOING TO BE A DIFFICULT TASK FOR


216
0:7:25,3 --> 0:7:26,97
STU BROWNELL WHO'S IN THAT


217
0:7:26,97 --> 0:7:28,5
POSITION, BUT SOMEONE THAT WE


218
0:7:28,5 --> 0:7:29,9
BELIEVE IN AND IS GOING TO HELP


219
0:7:29,9 --> 0:7:31,8
US THIS YEAR AND IF NOT THIS


220
0:7:31,8 --> 0:7:33,1

0:7:33,1 --> 0:7:34,23
SPEAKER: DEFINITELY HAVE A LOT


222
0:7:34,23 --> 0:7:35,93
OF CONFIDENCE IN THEM, JUST FROM


223
0:7:35,93 --> 0:7:37,43
THE FEW SCRIMMAGES THAT WE'VE


224
0:7:37,43 --> 0:7:38,63
HAD AND THE CAPTAIN'S PRACTICES.


225
0:7:38,63 --> 0:7:39,83
THEY LOOK PRETTY GOOD. EACH OF


226
0:7:39,83 --> 0:7:41,0
THEM BRING SOMETHING DIFFERENT


227
0:7:41,0 --> 0:7:42,43
TO THE TABLE. I HAVE A GOOD


228
0:7:42,43 --> 0:7:44,53
FEELING THAT THEY'LL STEP RIGHT


229
0:7:44,53 --> 0:7:48,4
IN AND FILL SOME HOLES FOR US


230
0:7:48,4 --> 0:7:49,7
AND START THEIR LEARNING CURVE


231
0:7:49,7 --> 0:7:52,17
AND THEIR GROWTH FROM DAY ONE.


232
0:7:52,17 --> 0:7:54,3
NEW SPEAKER: THE FRESHMEN ARE


233
0:7:54,3 --> 0:7:55,93
VERY GOOD THIS YEAR; I'M VERY


234
0:7:55,93 --> 0:7:57,43
EXCITED. THIS YEAR'S PROBABLY


235
0:7:57,43 --> 0:7:59,33
THE MOST EXCITED I'VE BEEN OUT


236
0:7:59,33 --> 0:8:1,47
OF THE TWO PREVIOUS YEARS ABOUT


237
0:8:1,47 --> 0:8:2,6
OUR FRESHMEN COMING IN. THEY'RE


238
0:8:2,6 --> 0:8:4,13
VERY SKILLED AND ALL OF THEM CAN


239
0:8:4,13 --> 0:8:5,6
STEP IN AND PLAY RIGHT AWAY.


240
0:8:5,6 --> 0:8:6,77
HILL: AND AS A SENIOR YOU'VE


241
0:8:6,77 --> 0:8:7,8
SEEN THIS TEAM GROW. WHAT DO YOU


242
0:8:7,8 --> 0:8:9,37
THINK ARE SOME OF YOUR STRENGTHS


243
0:8:9,37 --> 0:8:10,47
AND WEAKNESSES? NEW SPEAKER: I


244
0:8:10,47 --> 0:8:11,47
THINK ONE OF OUR BIGGEST


245
0:8:11,47 --> 0:8:12,97
STRENGTHS IS OUR TEAM DEFENSE. I


246
0:8:12,97 --> 0:8:14,33
THINK WE PLAY PRETTY GOOD IN THE


247
0:8:14,33 --> 0:8:15,9
DEFENSIVE ZONE AND OUR


248
0:8:15,9 --> 0:8:17,23
GOALTENDING'S BEEN PHENOMENAL


249
0:8:17,23 --> 0:8:18,33
EVER SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE AND I


250
0:8:18,33 --> 0:8:19,97
CAN SEE IT CONTINUE TO GROW WITH


251
0:8:19,97 --> 0:8:22,0
RUBY AND WATSON TAKING OVER WHEN


252
0:8:22,0 --> 0:8:24,8
SHANE LEAVES. OUR OFFENSE HAS


253
0:8:24,8 --> 0:8:26,67
ALWAYS BEEN PRETTY TOP NOTCH,


254
0:8:26,67 --> 0:8:27,97
BUT I THINK SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE


255
0:8:27,97 --> 0:8:29,73
OUR TEAM DEFENSE HAS PROGRESSED


256
0:8:29,73 --> 0:8:30,77
PRETTY WELL. NEW SPEAKER: I


257
0:8:30,77 --> 0:8:31,7
THINK SOME OF OUR STRENGTHS


258
0:8:31,7 --> 0:8:32,9
WOULD DEFINITELY BE OUR SPEED,


259
0:8:32,9 --> 0:8:34,2
AGAIN, THAT'S ALWAYS ONE OF OUR


260
0:8:34,2 --> 0:8:36,93
STRENGTHS EVERY YEAR IS OUR


261
0:8:36,93 --> 0:8:38,7
SPEED, AND OUR PLAYMAKING AND


262
0:8:38,7 --> 0:8:39,67
OUR WORK ETHIC ARE HUGE


263
0:8:39,67 --> 0:8:41,7
STRENGTHS. AND THEN SOME OF OUR


264
0:8:41,7 --> 0:8:44,4
WEAKNESSES PROBABLY ARE GOING TO


265
0:8:44,4 --> 0:8:45,67
BE GOAL SCORING AND STUFF LIKE


266
0:8:45,67 --> 0:8:46,93
THAT, LOSING BRENNER, LIKE I


267
0:8:46,93 --> 0:8:48,8
SAID, WHERE HE SCORED A LOT OF


268
0:8:48,8 --> 0:8:50,7
GOALS FOR US LAST YEAR AND OVER


269
0:8:50,7 --> 0:8:52,4
HIS CAREER, SO WE'RE GOING TO


270
0:8:52,4 --> 0:8:53,47
HAVE TO SEE WHO'S GOING TO FILL


271
0:8:53,47 --> 0:8:54,97
THOSE VOIDS AND SCORE SOME


272
0:8:54,97 --> 0:8:55,93
GOALS. HILL: SO WHAT ARE YOUR


273
0:8:55,93 --> 0:8:57,0
EXPECTATIONS FOR THE TEAM THIS


274
0:8:57,0 --> 0:8:58,37
SEASON? WILSON: OUR GOAL IS TO


275
0:8:58,37 --> 0:9:1,1
GO TO THE NCAA'S. YOU KNOW, WE


276
0:9:1,1 --> 0:9:3,67
SAY THAT RESPECTFULLY TO ALL OF


277
0:9:3,67 --> 0:9:4,83
OUR OPPONENTS IN THAT WE KNOW


278
0:9:4,83 --> 0:9:6,0
WE'RE GOING TO GET STIFF


279
0:9:6,0 --> 0:9:8,0
COMPETITION AND IT'S A VERY


280
0:9:8,0 --> 0:9:9,5
TOUGH THING TO ACCOMPLISH. NEW


281
0:9:9,5 --> 0:9:12,3
SPEAKER: DEFINITELY SAME AS LAST


282
0:9:12,3 --> 0:9:13,3
YEAR AND THE YEAR BEFORE: GET


283
0:9:13,3 --> 0:9:14,6
BACK INTO THE NCAA TOURNAMENT.


284
0:9:14,6 --> 0:9:15,63
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN OUR GOAL SINCE


285
0:9:15,63 --> 0:9:19,0
I'VE BEEN HERE AND I THINK IF WE


286
0:9:19,0 --> 0:9:21,2
JUST KEEP THAT IN OUR MINDS,


287
0:9:21,2 --> 0:9:22,23
WE'LL ACHIEVE IT. I KNOW WE CAME


288
0:9:22,23 --> 0:9:23,77
UP SHORT LAST YEAR AND THEN TWO


289
0:9:23,77 --> 0:9:24,77
YEARS AGO WHEN WE WENT TO THE


290
0:9:24,77 --> 0:9:25,93
FROZEN FOUR WAS JUST A MAGICAL


291
0:9:25,93 --> 0:9:28,4
THING, BUT WE DEFINITELY NEED


292
0:9:28,4 --> 0:9:33,93

0:9:33,93 --> 0:9:36,43

GOT GUYS THAT CAN GIVE YOU A


328
0:10:57,2 --> 0:10:58,6
PATH TO PLAY BEYOND COLLEGE NOW,


329
0:10:58,6 --> 0:11:0,23
SO WHEN WE'RE RECRUITING NOW, WE


330
0:11:0,23 --> 0:11:1,6
TALK TO KIDS ABOUT THE ACADEMIC


331
0:11:1,6 --> 0:11:4,3
OPPORTUNITIES, THE CO OP, HOW


332
0:11:4,3 --> 0:11:5,93
GREAT RIT IS ACADEMICALLY, BUT


333
0:11:5,93 --> 0:11:6,83
WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN ABLE TO TALK


334
0:11:6,83 --> 0:11:8,7
ABOUT THAT. NOW WE'RE ABLE TO


335
0:11:8,7 --> 0:11:9,3
ADD ON ON THAT LEVEL OF, IF YOU


336
0:11:9,3 --> 0:11:10,0
WANT TO PLAY AFTER COLLEGE,


337
0:11:10,0 --> 0:11:10,83
WE'VE GOT GUYS HERE THAT CAN


338
0:11:10,83 --> 0:11:11,97
HELP YOU GET THERE TOO.


339
0:11:11,97 --> 0:11:13,7
BLOSSETT: KEAGLE PITCHED


340
0:11:13,7 --> 0:11:14,13
PROFESSIONALLY FOR ELEVEN YEARS,


341
0:11:14,13 --> 0:11:15,37
INCLUDING THREE SEASONS IN THE


342
0:11:15,37 --> 0:11:22,47
MAJORS WITH THE DETROIT TIGERS.


343
0:11:22,47 --> 0:11:23,6
KEAGLE: NOTHING THAT I TALK


344
0:11:23,6 --> 0:11:25,1
ABOUT I INVENTED. IT'S ALL


345
0:11:25,1 --> 0:11:26,23
THINGS I WAS SMART ENOUGH TO


346
0:11:26,23 --> 0:11:27,43
LISTEN TO OTHER COACHES THAT HAD


347
0:11:27,43 --> 0:11:29,1
BEEN AROUND THE GAME A LONG


348
0:11:29,1 --> 0:11:31,1
TIME. IT TOOK ME A LONG TIME TO


349
0:11:31,1 --> 0:11:32,93
REALIZE THAT IF YOU CAN SLOW


350
0:11:32,93 --> 0:11:33,73
THIS GAME DOWN, YOU'RE GOING TO


351
0:11:33,73 --> 0:11:35,0
BE A LOT MORE PRODUCTIVE AND A


352
0:11:35,0 --> 0:11:36,2
LOT MORE SUCCESSFUL, AND I THINK


353
0:11:36,2 --> 0:11:37,8
THAT FOR YOUNG PLAYERS, THAT'S


354
0:11:37,8 --> 0:11:39,57
THE HARDEST THING. I THINK THAT


355
0:11:39,57 --> 0:11:41,17
THE EXPERIENCES THAT WE WERE


356
0:11:41,17 --> 0:11:42,93
ABLE TO HAVE ALLOWS US TO


357
0:11:42,93 --> 0:11:44,0
HOPEFULLY INFLUENCE THE YOUNGER


358
0:11:44,0 --> 0:11:44,93
PLAYERS AND THE COLLEGE LEVEL


359
0:11:44,93 --> 0:11:45,9
ATHLETE TO EXPLAIN TO THEM,


360
0:11:45,9 --> 0:11:48,3
"LOOK, WE'VE STRUCK OUT; WE'VE


361
0:11:48,3 --> 0:11:49,5
GIVEN UP HOME RUNS. WE'VE MADE


362
0:11:49,5 --> 0:11:50,7
MISTAKES." AND I THINK TO BE


363
0:11:50,7 --> 0:11:52,9
ABLE TO EXPLAIN THAT TO THEM


364
0:11:52,9 --> 0:11:55,2
THAT YOU KNOW, IT'S REALLY,


365
0:11:55,2 --> 0:11:56,67
AGAIN, I'M THROWING QUITE A FEW


366
0:11:56,67 --> 0:11:57,63
CLICHÉS AROUND, BUT IT'S NOT


367
0:11:57,63 --> 0:11:58,93
WHETHER YOU GET KNOCKED DOWN,


368
0:11:58,93 --> 0:12:0,7
BUT WHETHER YOU GET UP.


369
0:12:0,7 --> 0:12:1,4
BLOSSETT: COACH LONG WORKS WITH


370
0:12:1,4 --> 0:12:2,67
RIT'S POSITION PLAYERS. HE


371
0:12:2,67 --> 0:12:4,67
PLAYED SIX SEASONS IN THE


372
0:12:4,67 --> 0:12:6,43
YANKEES MINOR LEAGUE SYSTEM,


373
0:12:6,43 --> 0:12:7,3
WHERE HE DEVELOPED A TIRELESS


374
0:12:7,3 --> 0:12:8,4
WORK ETHIC, THANKS TO FUTURE


375
0:12:8,4 --> 0:12:11,43
HALL OF FAMER DEREK JETER. LONG:


376
0:12:11,43 --> 0:12:17,53
DEREK JETER BY FAR, BY FAR, IT'S


377
0:12:17,53 --> 0:12:19,17
SO BY FAR, INFLUENCED ME IN SUCH


378
0:12:19,17 --> 0:12:20,83
A WAY IT'S UNBELIEVABLE AS FAR


379
0:12:20,83 --> 0:12:23,37
AS WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO. I


380
0:12:23,37 --> 0:12:26,4
STARTED GOING THROUGH A WORKOUT


381
0:12:26,4 --> 0:12:27,87
PROGRAM EVERY DAY WITH HIM,


382
0:12:27,87 --> 0:12:29,6
WHICH WAS A WEIGHT TRAINING


383
0:12:29,6 --> 0:12:31,47
PROGRAM. FIRST WE'D GO ON THE


384
0:12:31,47 --> 0:12:33,43
FIELD AT 9, WE'D DO ALL OF OUR


385
0:12:33,43 --> 0:12:35,43
STUFF UNTIL 12, WE'D GO INTO THE


386
0:12:35,43 --> 0:12:37,33
WEIGHT ROOM AT 1 AND LIFT UNTIL


387
0:12:37,33 --> 0:12:39,87
3 O'CLOCK. I HAD NEVER DONE


388
0:12:39,87 --> 0:12:43,8
ANYTHING LIKE THAT RELIGIOUSLY.


389
0:12:43,8 --> 0:12:45,53
THIS BOY, REGARDLESS OF HOW LATE


390
0:12:45,53 --> 0:12:48,53
WE WERE UP, WOULD BE AT THAT


391
0:12:48,53 --> 0:12:50,43
FIELD READY TO GO AT 9 O'CLOCK.


392
0:12:50,43 --> 0:12:53,17
MY TIME WITH JETER THOUGH, KEPT


393
0:12:53,17 --> 0:12:54,17
ME IN THE LEAGUE FOR SIX YEARS


394
0:12:54,17 --> 0:12:55,5
INSTEAD OF BEING CUT AFTER TWO.


395
0:12:55,5 --> 0:12:56,73
BLOSSETT: KEAGLE AND LONG NOT


396
0:12:56,73 --> 0:12:58,0
ONLY SHARE SIMILAR EXPERIENCES,


397
0:12:58,0 --> 0:12:59,93
BUT NOW SHARE SIMILAR


398
0:12:59,93 --> 0:13:1,9
PHILOSOPHIES, AS RIT ASSISTANT


399
0:13:1,9 --> 0:13:3,5
COACHES. KEAGLE: WE COACH VERY


400
0:13:3,5 --> 0:13:6,2
SIMILAR HERE AT SCHOOL: I'M NOT


401
0:13:6,2 --> 0:13:8,3
A BABYSITTER. WE ARE HERE AS


402
0:13:8,3 --> 0:13:10,43
SUPPORT AND I CAN'T WANT IT


403
0:13:10,43 --> 0:13:11,77
WORSE THAN MY PLAYERS WANT IT,


404
0:13:11,77 --> 0:13:13,13
AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT HE'S


405
0:13:13,13 --> 0:13:14,63
TALKING ABOUT WITH DEREK. NOBODY


406
0:13:14,63 --> 0:13:16,53
WAS THERE TO TELL DEREK! HERE'S


407
0:13:16,53 --> 0:13:18,37
A GUY ON REHAB AND AT THAT


408
0:13:18,37 --> 0:13:20,3
POINT, LET'S FACE IT: BASEBALL,


409
0:13:20,3 --> 0:13:21,33
ONE THING YOU KNOW IS WHEN


410
0:13:21,33 --> 0:13:23,7
YOU'RE HURT, YOU GET FORGOTTEN


411
0:13:23,7 --> 0:13:25,4
VERY EASILY. SO IT'S UP TO YOU


412
0:13:25,4 --> 0:13:26,63
TO PULL YOURSELF UP BY THE


413
0:13:26,63 --> 0:13:28,2
BOOTSTRAPS AND GO OUT AND DO


414
0:13:28,2 --> 0:13:29,97
YOUR WORK. WE USE THIS ALL THE


415
0:13:29,97 --> 0:13:31,6
TIME, THIS ANALOGY: IT'S NOT AN


416
0:13:31,6 --> 0:13:33,2
ACCIDENT. YOU PUT YOURSELF IN A


417
0:13:33,2 --> 0:13:35,2
POSITION TO HAVE SUCCESS,


418
0:13:35,2 --> 0:13:37,0
SUCCESS WILL COME. DON'T EXPECT


419
0:13:37,0 --> 0:13:39,3
IT TO JUST COME BECAUSE YOU'RE


420
0:13:39,3 --> 0:13:41,1
TALENTED, FIRST ROUND PICK, THIS


421
0:13:41,1 --> 0:13:42,33
THAT OR THE NEXT THING, BECAUSE


422
0:13:42,33 --> 0:13:43,97
THERE'S BEEN SOMEBODY ALONG THE


423
0:13:43,97 --> 0:13:45,0
WAY WHO CAME ALONG WHO WAS JUST


424
0:13:45,0 --> 0:13:47,0
AS TALENTED, JUST AS RICH, JUST


425
0:13:47,0 --> 0:13:48,17
AS CONNECTED AS YOU WERE. GROW:


426
0:13:48,17 --> 0:13:50,43
THEY'RE ON THE SAME PAGE BECAUSE


427
0:13:50,43 --> 0:13:51,57
THEY HAD THE SAME EXPERIENCES.


428
0:13:51,57 --> 0:13:52,97
