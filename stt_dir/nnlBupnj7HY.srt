3
0:0:4,82 --> 0:0:7,42
the most lethal road
in the world.


4
0:0:7,42 --> 0:0:10,76
It's also here that their
British had their biggest


5
0:0:10,76 --> 0:0:16,25
single loss of life when five
soldiers from two rifles were


6
0:0:16,25 --> 0:0:18,14
killed in one IED blast.


7
0:0:18,14 --> 0:0:24,52

0:0:24,52 --> 0:0:26,1
AMERICAN SOLDIER: With
IEDs, it's all luck.


9
0:0:26,1 --> 0:0:29,55
I've been really I haven't
stepped on one, and a couple


10
0:0:29,55 --> 0:0:31,395
of people have just stepped
in the wrong spot


11
0:0:31,395 --> 0:0:32,552
at the wrong time.

0:0:48,255 --> 0:0:48,75

20
0:0:48,75 --> 0:0:49,245
AMERICAN SOLDIER: Can you see?

0:0:49,245 --> 0:0:49,74
MALE SPEAKER: Huh?


22
0:0:49,74 --> 0:0:50,99
AMERICAN SOLDIER: Can
you stand up?

0:0:55,59 --> 0:0:56,574
AMERICAN SOLDIER:
Hold on to me.


27
0:0:56,574 --> 0:0:57,824
Let's go.


28
0:0:57,824 --> 0:1:17,238



29
0:1:17,238 --> 0:1:19,19
MICHAEL HASTINGS: Well, first
off, I just want to thank


30
0:1:19,19 --> 0:1:20,66
Powerhouse for having us here.


31
0:1:20,66 --> 0:1:23,79
This is one of my favorite spots
in all of the greater


32
0:1:23,79 --> 0:1:25,1
Tri-State Area.


33
0:1:25,1 --> 0:1:27,0
They have a bunch
of great events.


34
0:1:27,0 --> 0:1:30,34
And it's really an
honor to be here.


35
0:1:30,34 --> 0:1:34,88
So Ben is someone whose work
I've respected and admired for


36
0:1:34,88 --> 0:1:38,62
its bravery, its courage, and
also his willingness to get


37
0:1:38,62 --> 0:1:41,11
shot at in many places
around the globe.


38
0:1:41,11 --> 0:1:43,93
So Ben's book, "No Worse
Enemy." you're


39
0:1:43,93 --> 0:1:45,73
a documentary filmmaker.


40
0:1:45,73 --> 0:1:50,75
Why did you decide to
write the book?


41
0:1:50,75 --> 0:1:53,19
BEN ANDERSON: Originally I had
no intention to write a book.


42
0:1:53,19 --> 0:1:55,75
It was just one documentary at
a time, mostly for the BBC,


43
0:1:55,75 --> 0:1:57,53
then HBO, then BBC again.


44
0:1:57,53 --> 0:2:1,43
But about 18 months ago, the
statements were coming out of


45
0:2:1,43 --> 0:2:4,57
Kabul, London, and Washington
about how progress was being


46
0:2:4,57 --> 0:2:7,36
made, our goals were being met,
the Afghans were almost


47
0:2:7,36 --> 0:2:9,179
ready to take over so
we could leave with


48
0:2:9,179 --> 0:2:10,18
our heads held high.


49
0:2:10,18 --> 0:2:12,77
And I feel that's the exact
opposite of what I'd been


50
0:2:12,77 --> 0:2:15,19
seeing for the last
five years.


51
0:2:15,19 --> 0:2:16,73
I never believed it when
an author said, I


52
0:2:16,73 --> 0:2:17,62
had to write a book.


53
0:2:17,62 --> 0:2:19,75
But suddenly, I thought, I
have to write this book.


54
0:2:19,75 --> 0:2:22,54
I have to get everything I've
seen and filmed down on paper


55
0:2:22,54 --> 0:2:23,1
in one place.


56
0:2:23,1 --> 0:2:25,83
And apart from literally a
handful of quotes in here from


57
0:2:25,83 --> 0:2:27,62
my notebooks, it's all
from my own footage.


58
0:2:27,62 --> 0:2:29,32
So it's not my opinion.


59
0:2:29,32 --> 0:2:31,14
I'm not exaggerating.


60
0:2:31,14 --> 0:2:34,8
it's a really simple portrait of
what the war actually looks


61
0:2:34,8 --> 0:2:36,48
like, because that's so
different to the war that


62
0:2:36,48 --> 0:2:38,69
we're being told is
going on now.


63
0:2:38,69 --> 0:2:41,95
MICHAEL HASTINGS: Now the
strategy that we have is the


64
0:2:41,95 --> 0:2:45,8
reason we could pull out, in
theory, because there's the


65
0:2:45,8 --> 0:2:46,5
Afghan national security
forces, the


66
0:2:46,5 --> 0:2:47,72
police, and the army.


67
0:2:47,72 --> 0:2:53,371
You have a clip, I think, that
demonstrates the equality of--


68
0:2:53,371 --> 0:2:58,0
I feel like it's easy to bash
the Afghans, and especially in


69
0:2:58,0 --> 0:3:0,17
the US, we often do that.


70
0:3:0,17 --> 0:3:1,95
You'll read the "New York Times
well, everything would


71
0:3:1,95 --> 0:3:4,1
be going well in the Afghanistan
War if the Afghans


72
0:3:4,1 --> 0:3:6,8
weren't such fuck-ups.


73
0:3:6,8 --> 0:3:8,3
At the same time, you have
this great clip.


74
0:3:8,3 --> 0:3:9,87
Why don't you introduce the
clip, and we'll start with


75
0:3:9,87 --> 0:3:13,52
that to give us a flavor
of the real war that


76
0:3:13,52 --> 0:3:15,45
you don't often see.


77
0:3:15,45 --> 0:3:15,59
BEN ANDERSON: OK.


78
0:3:15,59 --> 0:3:18,75
This clip is from my first trip
to Afghanistan in 2007,


79
0:3:18,75 --> 0:3:21,95
and it's not an exceptional
clip at all.


80
0:3:21,95 --> 0:3:25,13
We'd been under attack
for about six hours.


81
0:3:25,13 --> 0:3:27,42
A Hellfire missile had struck
a building-- the wrong


82
0:3:27,42 --> 0:3:28,82
building by mistake,
where British and


83
0:3:28,82 --> 0:3:29,77
Afghan soldiers were.


84
0:3:29,77 --> 0:3:31,37
We thought they'd been killed.


85
0:3:31,37 --> 0:3:34,3
So we ran across a field under
Taliban fire into this


86
0:3:34,3 --> 0:3:35,81
building to check
on these guys.


87
0:3:35,81 --> 0:3:37,98
Found out they were all
OK, miraculously.


88
0:3:37,98 --> 0:3:41,16
The British responded by saying,
this is the most


89
0:3:41,16 --> 0:3:42,63
intense day of fighting
they'd ever had.


90
0:3:42,63 --> 0:3:45,795
The Afghans responded by
skinning up a huge joint.


91
0:3:45,795 --> 0:3:48,2
And you'll see what
happens next.


92
0:3:48,2 --> 0:3:49,37
BRITISH SOLDIER: I don't
understand how they could


93
0:3:49,37 --> 0:3:51,54
smoke it in the middle
of a battle.


94
0:3:51,54 --> 0:3:52,555
It'd make you worse.


95
0:3:52,555 --> 0:3:53,55
But they love it.


96
0:3:53,55 --> 0:3:55,78
As soon as they get two minutes,
then they'll start


97
0:3:55,78 --> 0:3:57,57
smoking and passing it around.


98
0:3:57,57 --> 0:3:58,91
All laughing and joking.


99
0:3:58,91 --> 0:4:0,31
And then a minute
later, they're


100
0:4:0,31 --> 0:4:1,22
running out towards bullets.


101
0:4:1,22 --> 0:4:3,42
BEN ANDERSON: But I thought it
might make them more cautious.


102
0:4:3,42 --> 0:4:3,985
BRITISH SOLDIER: Yeah.


103
0:4:3,985 --> 0:4:6,98
It would make me
more cautious.


104
0:4:6,98 --> 0:4:8,3
BEN ANDERSON: But apparently
it has the opposite effect.


105
0:4:8,3 --> 0:4:9,26
BRITISH SOLDIER: Yeah.


106
0:4:9,26 --> 0:4:10,49
They love it.


107
0:4:10,49 --> 0:4:12,14
BEN ANDERSON: So the Afghan--


108
0:4:12,14 --> 0:4:14,2
they got stoned for
about an hour.


109
0:4:14,2 --> 0:4:14,98
They were completely
out of control.


110
0:4:14,98 --> 0:4:16,57
One of them had eyes pointing
different directions.


111
0:4:16,57 --> 0:4:19,279
And he actually ran out and he
was so stoned that he was just


112
0:4:19,279 --> 0:4:20,97
aiming at something
in the sky.


113
0:4:20,97 --> 0:4:23,17
And I don't know if you saw it,
but a bullet came and shot


114
0:4:23,17 --> 0:4:27,27
the top cover off his rifle,
which was pretty funny, when


115
0:4:27,27 --> 0:4:27,64
you look at that footage.


116
0:4:27,64 --> 0:4:30,4
But afterwards, we thought,
actually, a few inches up and


117
0:4:30,4 --> 0:4:32,1
we'd have seen a guy getting
his head blown off


118
0:4:32,1 --> 0:4:33,24
right next to us.


119
0:4:33,24 --> 0:4:36,1
And it is difficult to bash
the Afghan National Army.


120
0:4:36,1 --> 0:4:38,27
The Afghan National Police, I'm
actually happy to bash.


121
0:4:38,27 --> 0:4:41,5
They're hate and feared by
the local population.


122
0:4:41,5 --> 0:4:44,86
I spoke to one of the Northern
Irish guys training the Afghan


123
0:4:44,86 --> 0:4:47,92
National Police, and he said 90%
of the crime in Helmand is


124
0:4:47,92 --> 0:4:50,17
committed by the police.


125
0:4:50,17 --> 0:4:53,0
And bear in mind that the
counterinsurgency policy is,


126
0:4:53,0 --> 0:4:55,96
we're trying to persuade the
Afghans to choose us and the


127
0:4:55,96 --> 0:4:58,78
Afghan security forces
over the Taliban.


128
0:4:58,78 --> 0:5:1,95
It's no surprise that lots of
people in the south are going


129
0:5:1,95 --> 0:5:4,3
to choose the Taliban, and see
the Taliban as the good guys.


130
0:5:4,3 --> 0:5:6,59
MICHAEL HASTINGS: One of the
incredible moments in your


131
0:5:6,59 --> 0:5:9,7
book, when you're sort of
explaining your reporting


132
0:5:9,7 --> 0:5:13,9
techniques, you said you went
through and had what the


133
0:5:13,9 --> 0:5:17,7
Afghans said translated versus
what people thought they said


134
0:5:17,7 --> 0:5:18,73
at the time, and there were
big discrepancies.


135
0:5:18,73 --> 0:5:21,37
Can you talk about this sort of
lost in translation aspect


136
0:5:21,37 --> 0:5:23,72
of the conflict?


137
0:5:23,72 --> 0:5:26,5
BEN ANDERSON: First of I was
always shocked by how few


138
0:5:26,5 --> 0:5:29,61
American and British forces
learned Pashto or Dari.


139
0:5:29,61 --> 0:5:32,44
And most of that is because
they do six-month tours.


140
0:5:32,44 --> 0:5:35,2
And you can't learn about a
local culture and establish


141
0:5:35,2 --> 0:5:36,94
relations in six months.


142
0:5:36,94 --> 0:5:40,32
But for some reason, the
interpreters they employ would


143
0:5:40,32 --> 0:5:41,4
often mistranslate things.


144
0:5:41,4 --> 0:5:44,145
So there was a meeting with a
mullah in Sangin where he came


145
0:5:44,145 --> 0:5:44,71
out of his mosque.


146
0:5:44,71 --> 0:5:46,96
And he lived about 100 meters
away from a US base.


147
0:5:46,96 --> 0:5:49,14
So if anyone's benefiting
from our presence there,


148
0:5:49,14 --> 0:5:50,145
it should be him.


149
0:5:50,145 --> 0:5:51,21
And he came out, and he said,


150
0:5:51,21 --> 0:5:52,445
yesterday you shot my daughter.


151
0:5:52,445 --> 0:5:53,96
A stray bullet hit her
in the shoulder.


152
0:5:53,96 --> 0:5:55,74
And you wouldn't let us through
the checkpoint.


153
0:5:55,74 --> 0:5:56,95
We had to take her
to hospital.


154
0:5:56,95 --> 0:5:58,37
It took seven hours.


155
0:5:58,37 --> 0:6:0,26
How do you expect us to embrace
you when this is how


156
0:6:0,26 --> 0:6:1,28
you treat us?


157
0:6:1,28 --> 0:6:3,81
The translation was, we're
very glad you're here,


158
0:6:3,81 --> 0:6:6,8
security's improved, and my
kids can play outside.


159
0:6:6,8 --> 0:6:9,8
And I had no idea of this until
I got back to London and


160
0:6:9,8 --> 0:6:10,96
sat down with a really good
translator and went through


161
0:6:10,96 --> 0:6:13,64
all of my tapes, one by one.


162
0:6:13,64 --> 0:6:14,5
MICHAEL HASTINGS: That's
incredible.


163
0:6:14,5 --> 0:6:18,14
Now, you mentioned just briefly
the old man who


164
0:6:18,14 --> 0:6:20,27
brought his daughter
who'd been shot.


165
0:6:20,27 --> 0:6:23,54
Can you talk a little bit about
the solatia payments, or


166
0:6:23,54 --> 0:6:27,55
the payments we actually make
to Afghan civilians, the


167
0:6:27,55 --> 0:6:30,33
families of Afghan civilians
who die?


168
0:6:30,33 --> 0:6:32,5
BEN ANDERSON: Every time there
are civilian casualties,


169
0:6:32,5 --> 0:6:34,35
there's a condolence payment
meeting the next day.


170
0:6:34,35 --> 0:6:36,52
And the British actually pay
less than the Americans, but


171
0:6:36,52 --> 0:6:40,29
the Americans pay $2,500
per life lost.


172
0:6:40,29 --> 0:6:43,8
AMERICAN SOLDIER: There's
nothing we can do to bring


173
0:6:43,8 --> 0:6:44,76
back your loss.


174
0:6:44,76 --> 0:6:55,36
What we can do is try to help
you out by giving you the very


175
0:6:55,36 --> 0:7:2,665
least that we can with a payment
for your losses.


176
0:7:2,665 --> 0:7:7,97



177
0:7:7,97 --> 0:7:12,78
AMERICAN SOLDIER: And again,
I'm, I'm deeply, deeply sorry.


178
0:7:12,78 --> 0:7:15,67
AMERICAN SOLDIER: Gentlemen,
this is for you.


179
0:7:15,67 --> 0:7:19,34
For your losses.


180
0:7:19,34 --> 0:7:22,13
MICHAEL HASTINGS: What do you
think's going through that


181
0:7:22,13 --> 0:7:24,88
guy's mind, when he's hearing
this from foreigners?


182
0:7:24,88 --> 0:7:26,89
And what do you think
he did afterwards?


183
0:7:26,89 --> 0:7:31,1
You think he joined the
Taliban or just


184
0:7:31,1 --> 0:7:32,67
went on with his life?


185
0:7:32,67 --> 0:7:34,527
BEN ANDERSON: I spent a lot of
time in Marja after the that


186
0:7:34,527 --> 0:7:37,58
incident, and surprisingly,
he forgave the Marines.


187
0:7:37,58 --> 0:7:39,56
I think he realized it was a
mistake, and he had a very


188
0:7:39,56 --> 0:7:40,72
good relationship with
the Marines.


189
0:7:40,72 --> 0:7:43,3
And the thing he was most angry
about at that meeting,


190
0:7:43,3 --> 0:7:46,19
initially, was that McChrystal
and everybody had made a big--


191
0:7:46,19 --> 0:7:48,95
Marja was announced months in
advance, so the Taliban had


192
0:7:48,95 --> 0:7:50,11
months to prepare.


193
0:7:50,11 --> 0:7:53,42
They built incredible networks
of bunkers and trenches and


194
0:7:53,42 --> 0:7:55,17
set booby traps everywhere.


195
0:7:55,17 --> 0:7:57,53
But they said to the civilians,
we're not going to


196
0:7:57,53 --> 0:7:59,68
use any rockets that can pierce
the thick walls of your


197
0:7:59,68 --> 0:8:1,21
house, so stay indoors.


198
0:8:1,21 --> 0:8:2,39
Don't flee.


199
0:8:2,39 --> 0:8:3,8
We're here to protect you.


200
0:8:3,8 --> 0:8:5,88
And he said, I did what
you told me to do.


201
0:8:5,88 --> 0:8:7,855
I waited inside my house
for four days.


202
0:8:7,855 --> 0:8:10,5
All you had to do was shout,
and I would have walked


203
0:8:10,5 --> 0:8:11,0
towards you.


204
0:8:11,0 --> 0:8:13,81
And then there was nothing
but you and the Taliban.


205
0:8:13,81 --> 0:8:15,31
And that's what he was most
mad about, was he'd done


206
0:8:15,31 --> 0:8:17,985
exactly what he was told to
do, and he still lost four


207
0:8:17,985 --> 0:8:21,11
family members as a result.


208
0:8:21,11 --> 0:8:27,46
MICHAEL HASTINGS: The IED, the
Improvised Explosive Device,


209
0:8:27,46 --> 0:8:33,9
it's what terrorizes both, I
think, NATO troops and also


210
0:8:33,9 --> 0:8:35,39
local civilians.


211
0:8:35,39 --> 0:8:37,909
Can you set up this
next clip for us?


212
0:8:37,909 --> 0:8:39,28
Feel free to talk about your
own experience, obviously,


213
0:8:39,28 --> 0:8:42,549
with the improvised
explosive device.


214
0:8:42,549 --> 0:8:45,52
BEN ANDERSON: The last clip is
from Sangin, which is probably


215
0:8:45,52 --> 0:8:48,8
the town in the whole of
Afghanistan, outside of Kabul,


216
0:8:48,8 --> 0:8:50,55
which has had more manpower and
resources devoted to it


217
0:8:50,55 --> 0:8:52,19
for longer than anywhere else.


218
0:8:52,19 --> 0:8:54,41
And this was my last
trip to Afghanistan


219
0:8:54,41 --> 0:8:55,95
with Three Five Marines.


220
0:8:55,95 --> 0:8:59,62
And the IED threat was so bad
that it took four hours to


221
0:8:59,62 --> 0:9:1,94
walk two kilometers
on a patrol.


222
0:9:1,94 --> 0:9:4,33
You had to walk in single file,
and you literally had to


223
0:9:4,33 --> 0:9:6,81
walk in the bootprints of the
minesweeper in front of you.


224
0:9:6,81 --> 0:9:10,71



225
0:9:10,71 --> 0:9:13,6
The man at the end of the
command wire has let us walk


226
0:9:13,6 --> 0:9:15,25
over the daisy chain.


227
0:9:15,25 --> 0:9:19,9
He knows there are more
Marines coming behind.


228
0:9:19,9 --> 0:9:20,89
AMERICAN SOLDIER: Hey, we're
going to have to get


229
0:9:20,89 --> 0:9:22,49
on the other one.


230
0:9:22,49 --> 0:9:23,225
AMERICAN SOLDIER: [INAUDIBLE]
good?


231
0:9:23,225 --> 0:9:25,348
[EXPLOSION]


232
0:9:25,348 --> 0:9:29,502



233
0:9:29,502 --> 0:9:30,326
AMERICAN SOLDIER:
Is anybody hit?


234
0:9:30,326 --> 0:9:31,734
AMERICAN SOLDIER:
Is anyone hit?


235
0:9:31,734 --> 0:9:35,71



236
0:9:35,71 --> 0:9:38,12
BEN ANDERSON: Five of the
seven bombs went off.


237
0:9:38,12 --> 0:9:40,36
AMERICAN SOLDIER: See
where it's at?


238
0:9:40,36 --> 0:9:41,96
It was right there.


239
0:9:41,96 --> 0:9:44,734
BEN ANDERSON: Just seconds after
we had walked over them.


240
0:9:44,734 --> 0:9:46,138
AMERICAN SOLDIER: Can
you stand up?


241
0:9:46,138 --> 0:9:46,606
MALE SPEAKER: Huh?


242
0:9:46,606 --> 0:9:47,55
AMERICAN SOLDIER: Can you see?


243
0:9:47,55 --> 0:9:48,2
MALE SPEAKER: Huh?


244
0:9:48,2 --> 0:9:49,485
AMERICAN SOLDIER: Can
you stand up?


245
0:9:49,485 --> 0:9:52,28
MALE SPEAKER: He
can't hear you.


246
0:9:52,28 --> 0:9:53,7
MICHAEL HASTINGS: Again,
incredible footage.


247
0:9:53,7 --> 0:9:55,4
This is the first time I've
watched an IED go off in a


248
0:9:55,4 --> 0:9:56,87
while because I can't even
watch this shit.


249
0:9:56,87 --> 0:9:59,64
What keeps bringing
you back there?


250
0:9:59,64 --> 0:10:0,56
Are they noble reasons?


251
0:10:0,56 --> 0:10:1,66
Are they selfish reasons?


252
0:10:1,66 --> 0:10:3,675
Are they adrenaline reasons?


253
0:10:3,675 --> 0:10:6,35



254
0:10:6,35 --> 0:10:7,56
BEN ANDERSON: It's certainly
not adrenaline.


255
0:10:7,56 --> 0:10:10,86
I mean, people who say that that
is a thrill I don't think


256
0:10:10,86 --> 0:10:13,93
have really experienced it or
been close to real ambushes or


257
0:10:13,93 --> 0:10:15,18
firefights.


258
0:10:15,18 --> 0:10:18,76



259
0:10:18,76 --> 0:10:20,83
It's hard, because once you've
covered this stuff for a


260
0:10:20,83 --> 0:10:22,49
while, other stories--


261
0:10:22,49 --> 0:10:25,9
I mean, I try and cover the
Republican nomination, I try


262
0:10:25,9 --> 0:10:29,78
and follow British politics,
and it just feels boring.


263
0:10:29,78 --> 0:10:31,785
This, to me, feels like one
of the most important


264
0:10:31,785 --> 0:10:34,482
stories in the world.


265
0:10:34,482 --> 0:10:36,73
And now, when you ask
me a question


266
0:10:36,73 --> 0:10:38,71
like that, it's scary.


267
0:10:38,71 --> 0:10:41,17
But when you're out there, you
compare yourself to everyone


268
0:10:41,17 --> 0:10:42,4
around you.


269
0:10:42,4 --> 0:10:43,93
And the people around me
have to kill people.


270
0:10:43,93 --> 0:10:45,55
They maybe have to save
their friends lives.


271
0:10:45,55 --> 0:10:47,33
I don't have to do either
of those things.


272
0:10:47,33 --> 0:10:50,37
And the civilians around me, the
ones who are too poor to


273
0:10:50,37 --> 0:10:52,97
leave, they're really
suffering.


274
0:10:52,97 --> 0:10:54,32
I mean, compared to all
of those people,


275
0:10:54,32 --> 0:10:55,99
I'm kind of a VIP.


276
0:10:55,99 --> 0:10:58,27
I've got a cushy job,
compared to them.


277
0:10:58,27 --> 0:11:1,48
So that makes me think
I can keep on going


278
0:11:1,48 --> 0:11:2,56
back and doing more.


279
0:11:2,56 --> 0:11:5,3
And I really want to know
what happens out there.


280
0:11:5,3 --> 0:11:8,24
I'm not at all optimistic about
the future, but I really


281
0:11:8,24 --> 0:11:9,53
want to know how it turns out.


282
0:11:9,53 --> 0:11:11,3
And sadly, there aren't
that many people


283
0:11:11,3 --> 0:11:12,25
covering this anymore.


284
0:11:12,25 --> 0:11:15,47
MICHAEL HASTINGS: Can you
describe the process of you


285
0:11:15,47 --> 0:11:16,99
with the camera?


286
0:11:16,99 --> 0:11:20,52
BEN ANDERSON: Everything I'd
need, I carry on my back.


287
0:11:20,52 --> 0:11:22,79
And that means that I can join
an infantry group like these


288
0:11:22,79 --> 0:11:25,46
guys and stay with them
for five or six weeks.


289
0:11:25,46 --> 0:11:27,65
And if I sleep where they sleep
and run the same risks


290
0:11:27,65 --> 0:11:30,59
they run and eat what they
eat, they open up to me.


291
0:11:30,59 --> 0:11:33,75
And the goal is to film exactly
what the war really


292
0:11:33,75 --> 0:11:34,76
looks like.


293
0:11:34,76 --> 0:11:36,97
And I'm sure it's impossible
with me being there.


294
0:11:36,97 --> 0:11:39,2
I'm sure they temper their
behavior slightly because I'm


295
0:11:39,2 --> 0:11:41,75
there, but I think I've got
quite close to seeing how they


296
0:11:41,75 --> 0:11:43,4
would have behaved if
I wasn't there.


297
0:11:43,4 --> 0:11:46,36



298
0:11:46,36 --> 0:11:46,64
MICHAEL HASTINGS: Great.


299
0:11:46,64 --> 0:11:51,94
Well, I want to again thank
Powerhouse for having us in,


300
0:11:51,94 --> 0:11:54,38
and also you all for
coming out and for


301
0:11:54,38 --> 0:11:55,63
being engaged in this--


302
0:11:55,63 --> 0:11:58,9



303
0:11:58,9 --> 0:12:1,4
obviously, we spend $120
billion on it a year.


304
0:12:1,4 --> 0:12:3,78
I think over a thousand
Americans have died there


305
0:12:3,78 --> 0:12:6,78
since President Obama's been
elected, not to mention the


306
0:12:6,78 --> 0:12:9,356
thousands of Afghan civilians.


307
0:12:9,356 --> 0:12:13,61
So on that cheerful note, I want
to recommend Ben's book


308
0:12:13,61 --> 0:12:14,39
very highly.


309
0:12:14,39 --> 0:12:18,2
As a fellow author who does
these things, if you come,


310
0:12:18,2 --> 0:12:19,1
please buy the book.


311
0:12:19,1 --> 0:12:19,5
Come on.


312
0:12:19,5 --> 0:12:21,16
Just shell out for the
fucking thing.


313
0:12:21,16 --> 0:12:24,39
We're here, he'll
sign it for you.


314
0:12:24,39 --> 0:12:25,33
It'll be good.


315
0:12:25,33 --> 0:12:26,96
I'll buy your book when
it comes out too.


316
0:12:26,96 --> 0:12:29,6
Just email me.


317
0:12:29,6 --> 0:12:31,7
And just thanks again.


318
0:12:31,7 --> 0:12:33,15
This has been a really, I think,
hopefully a thoughtful,


319
0:12:33,15 --> 0:12:34,9
fruitful discussion.


320
0:12:34,9 --> 0:12:37,16
And Ben's one of the best
journalists, documentary


321
0:12:37,16 --> 0:12:39,52
filmmakers, who's out
there working today.


322
0:12:39,52 --> 0:12:42,8
So I'd like to give Ben
a round of applause


323
0:12:42,8 --> 0:12:43,556
and call it a night.


324
0:12:43,556 --> 0:13:5,67
[APPLAUSE]


325
0:13:5,67 --> 0:13:7,43
AMERICAN SOLDIER: This is life
in Afghanistan, see.


326
0:13:7,43 --> 0:15:7,43
