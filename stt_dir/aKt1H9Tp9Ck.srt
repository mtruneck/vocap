Hi Food Tubers, I'm going to show you how
to make the perfect pie pastry from scratch.


2
0:0:8,71 --> 0:0:12,8
Give it a twist and store it up for when you
need it next.


3
0:0:12,8 --> 0:0:17,33
Okay beautiful pastry. the old school rule
is half fat to flour. So, we've got 600 grams


4
0:0:17,33 --> 0:0:23,49
of flour here. Plain flour, you can sift it
if you like. A nice pinch of salt goes in


5
0:0:23,49 --> 0:0:28,35
just to get a bit of seasoning happening there.
Of course the classic in the old pies would


6
0:0:28,35 --> 0:0:34,79
be to use lard or butter. I'm using butter
which is brilliant, it's nice and it's sweet


7
0:0:34,79 --> 0:0:39,979
and it gives wonderful colour to pastry. So
I've got 150 grams of butter going in and


8
0:0:39,979 --> 0:0:45,739
then to make the fat, half fat to flour I'm
going to add 150 of cheddar cheese. Bust it


9
0:0:45,739 --> 0:0:49,69
up in your hand, grate it if you like but
the whole point of this is that you have a


10
0:0:49,69 --> 0:0:56,659
beautiful golden, rich, sweet, crumbly pastry
right but with this wonderful nuggets of cheese


11
0:0:56,659 --> 0:1:0,35
in there.
So we're going to use the rubbing in method


12
0:1:0,35 --> 0:1:5,65
so just with your thumb and forefingers so
just spend a couple of minutes rubbing this.


13
0:1:5,65 --> 0:1:12,9
So if we're going to make our own pastry do
it by hand because you get this amazing crumble


14
0:1:12,9 --> 0:1:16,11
that you simply can't replicate by a factory
made pastry.


15
0:1:16,11 --> 0:1:20,74
yes you can go and buy shortcrust pastry from
a supermarket it will be very good. This is


16
0:1:20,74 --> 0:1:24,13
amazing. You can actually make it in a food
processor and just pulse it, It will be very


17
0:1:24,13 --> 0:1:28,53
good but it won't be very good as this.
Just two minutes rubbing this flour together.


18
0:1:28,53 --> 0:1:33,28
Can you see how the flour has gone from chalky
white to a sort of yellow colour, it's little


19
0:1:33,28 --> 0:1:38,7
bit heavier now. So once you've rubbed it
in like this, I'm going to add about 250 grams


20
0:1:38,7 --> 0:1:44,47
of cold water.
We really don't want to over work this. This


21
0:1:44,47 --> 0:1:50,84
recipe is going back to roots, a little bit
of love, care and attention. Also it's about


22
0:1:50,84 --> 0:1:54,88
kind of under kneading it. You always think
that you've got to knead it like bread, you


23
0:1:54,88 --> 0:1:58,89
don't. You've got to literally scrunch the
dough. See what I'm doing I'm just packing


24
0:1:58,89 --> 0:2:4,51
it and pressing it together to make this because
you don't want to work the gluten in the flour


25
0:2:4,51 --> 0:2:10,369
because that makes it hard and little bit
like eating the bottom of your shoes. So we


26
0:2:10,369 --> 0:2:16,359
want to just push it together and that's the
key. So guys I've pretty much just pressed


27
0:2:16,359 --> 0:2:24,499
that pastry together. That's what it looks
like. Beautiful. If you want to see where


28
0:2:24,499 --> 0:2:33,659
this pastry ends up, click the link. Take
a look at my beautiful Aussie meat pie. Go


29
0:2:33,659 --> 0:4:33,659
and have a look!
