###22 For most of my life, I've given little thought to the soil.
###26 To me it was the flat surface that I walked on.
###29 I've been thinking a lot more about it these days and what I learned has
###33 surprised me.
###36 I learned that soil is like the earth's skin
###39 that lies between the
###40 sky and it's rock core.
###42 It's where plants keep tenuous grip with their roots,
###45 as they harvest the sun's energy with their leaves.
###49 I begin to realize that soil is alive.
###53 That a handful of good soil contains more living things than all the human
###57 beings that were ever born.
###60 It dawned on me that without soil
###62 life as we know it would not exist.
###66 If soil is alive
###68 I wondered if soil could die.
###71 I visited with Pam Thomas and spoke to her about this.
###75 A recent historical example is the Dust Bowl.
###78 In the early part of the 1900's homesteaders plowed
###81 millions of acres of prairie lands in order to plant crops, mostly wheat, because
###86 wheat was bringing very high prices during the
###88 World War one wheat boom.
###90 Well because of this intensive cultivation
###94 uh... the delicate balance - the ecosystem- was essentially destroyed - you know you
###99 had the plants, the animals and the micro-organisms
###102 to the point of where the soil no longer was able to function.
###106 So as the wet years of the twenties gave away to the
###109 drought of the
###110 thirties,
###111 the soil, which
###112 no longer had the natural anchors to keep the soil in place, became very
###116 susceptible to wind erosion.
###119 In fact in the nineteen thirties
###121 dust storms would start the great plains and would move cross-country to places like
###126 Boston and DC....
###129 Meanwhile in the southern US piedmont,
###132 plowing and monoculture crops destroyed soil,
###135 causing massive gully erosion.
###138 Some of these gullies are still visible today.
###142 No wonder FDR said that
###144 "the nation that destroys its soil, destroys itself."
###149 These were dramatic examples of soil destruction,
###152 and I got to thinking how we were doing today.
###156 We're still losing soil today. It's not as obvious to us today as it was in the Dust
###161 Bowl thirties
###162 but it's an ongoing crisis because....
###164 the bottom line is, we are feeding more and more people on fewer and
###168 fewer acres.
###170 We're literally losing ground.
###175 The nationalist Aldo Leopold warned us that one of the dangers of
###178 living away from the land
###180 is that we are inclined to think that our breakfast comes from the grocery store ...or a carton.
###188 This got me to wondering how much soil we had to feed
###190 our planet.
###192 My soil scientist friend Jackie helped me understand this. Imagine for a moment
###197 that the earth is this apple... seventy-five percent of the earth is covered by water...
###209 Now half of the dry land on our planet is too hot or too cold
###213 to produce food for humans.
###219 Of this amount, about half is too rocky, steep or too shallow to produce
###224 food.
###230 It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure that there's not much left
###233 over.
###236 And then what we have left is under pressure from things like urban sprawl
###239 and erosion.
###243 It takes five
###244 hundred years to form an inch of soil,
###247 something that can be destroyed in a few minutes,
###249 and that worries me.
###254 Leonardo DaVinci said that we know more about the movement of celestial bodies
###258 than about the soil underfoot...
###262 I'm guilty as charged
###264 but i'm not going to leave it that way.
###269 Join me in the rest of the series to find out what soil really is and what it
###273 means to us...
###274 perhaps if we learned more about soil we'd be better eqiupped to take care of the
###278 planet.
###292 If life is we know it depends on the soil,
###295 it stands to reason that what happens below the soil's surface has a profound
###299 influenced on what happens above the surface.
###303 My knowledge of soils needed to run deeper.
###307 The people that could help me do this were the soil scientists -
###311 their work is to look beneath the surface into this life-giving, yet unseen
###316 world.
###317 Each day in the field is an adventure of discovery for them -
###321 they have their own vocabulary and they love the feel of dirt in their hands.
###326 this was the soils dream team, and they would be my teachers for the
###330 next few weeks.
###332 Dennis is a veteran who has mapped over a million acres of soils in his lifetime.
###338 Lance and Emory are also seasoned soil explorers who have discovered a new soil
###342 series that bears their respective names.
###346 This was going to be fun.
###350 the first thing they showed me was how the soil was formed.
###354 This happens when weather and living plants and animals breakdown loose rock,
###358 called parent material.
###360 Parent material is typically weathered bedrock that over time becomes the main
###365 mineral component of the soil.
###367 It looks like rock when you dig it out, but as you can see
###370 it's very fragile
###372 massive structure, breaks easily.
###378 Dennis took me to a road cut to show me that overtime, soil is formed in layers called horizons.
###385 These horizons tell us about their history
###387 and they can also give us clues about their future.
###391 This is the A Horizon or the surface layer.
###395 Look at all those roots in there.
###398 That's wonderful.
###400 Dark colors caused by the organic matter in there.
###404 In here we have what's called the E Horizon, capital E.
###407 Fairly light in color,
###410 more sandy in texture
###412 and down below it,
###414 is our B Horizon
###416 that contains much more clay and you can see
###421 it's much more red down here, too.
###427 Each soil horizon has unique properties
###431 like depth, color or clay content.
###433 When these horizons are layered on top of each other over time,
###437 they form soil
###438 profiles which can be identified by name.
###441 they are often named for the place they were first identified, like Norfolk
###445 or Durham.
###450 When it comes to looking below the soil's surface, nothing is as effective as a
###454 good old-fashioned soil auger.
###457 You'll never find these guys in the field without one-
###460 I guarantee it.
###463 Now I began to see how soil profiles can tell their story,
###467 layer by layer.
###469 this is a soil profile
###472 put into a long tray so we can look at it a little
###475 easier that pulling it out with the auger.
###477 In this hand here
###480 you'll see this is the A Horizon
###482 and you'll see it is much darker cause it contains
###486 organic matter in here.
###488 This is the A Horizon or the surface layer. This is eight or ten inches below the surface
###494 and see how red this is?
###496 All soils contain iron and we
###498 know if we put a piece of iron
###501 outside for two weeks it turns rusty.
###504 This is rusty soil.
###507 Rusty soil, how about that?
###510 So each color has a different meaning-
###513 bright reds  and yellows mean that a soil is well-drained
###516 there's more oxygen
###517 in the soil to oxidize or rust the iron in the soils.
###522 Grey colors on the other hand, mean the soil is waterlogged for most of the year
###526 because there is less oxygen to get at the iron.
###530 A dark brown color means more organic matter
###533 which is mostly in the A Horizon or topsoil.
###537 we can use the Munsell Color book to classify the exact color of the soil.
###543 We take the
###544 soil ped
###545 and put it behind the book
###547 and find the colorship that it most resembles.
###553 I'm going to say that it's that color there
###556 2.5 YR 4 8
###560 2.5 YR 4 8 by the way
###563 is a more precise way of saying "red".
###567 Dennis also pointed out to me that soil depth is another way
###571 to identify soils.
###573 This is the "Cecil series" because the clay content
###576 extends below a thirty inch depth.
###579 If this clay content decreased above a a thirty inch depth
###583 it's called the "Pacolet series".
###585 They're kissing cousins.
###589 Whoa! kissing cousins?
###591 It turns out that if two soils have similar color and clay content,
###596 but different depths,
###597 they'd be named differently.
###600 At this point I knew enough to see how you could identify a specific soil series.
###606 I was now ready for Lance and Emory to show me their newly discovered soil -
###611 it's named the Brewback series.
###614 Right there, about 22 inches
###616 we just starting to barely nip on the CR material.
###619 You can hear the grind and feel it in the auger.
###625 Right here we have the A Horizon.
###627 It's about six inches thick and it's a fine, sandy loam.
###631 Then we get into the B Horizon, which is a heavy clay.
###636 And here, about
###637 twelve or fifteen inches, we have the uh...
###640 the grey colors
###641 coming in, and for a Brewback soil we have to have the grey colors within
###648 the top ten inches of the B Horzion.
###651 As we move on down the profile about twenty inches, we get the sandy, clay loam,
###655 which is the B-C horizon, which is a transition between the B Horizon and the parent material.
###663 By this time, I had seen a few soil series,
###666 each with its on color, depth, and clay content -
###670 each with its own personality if you will. It turns out that soil scientists have
###675 identified and mapped over nineteen thousand different soil series in the
###680 country.
###681 That sounds like a huge effort -
###683 I had to find out who was doing the work
###686 and why it is so important.
###697 I found out that the massive effort of identifying and mapping soils
###701 is known as the soil survey.
###703 The body of information resulting from this ongoing effort, also known as
###707 the soil survey,
###708 is available in hard copy and online at the web soil survey.
###715 It's an inventory of soil maps, soil properties, suitabilities and
###719 limitations.
###721 I was reminded that what happens beneath the surface of the soil ultimately
###725 affects everything above its surface.
###727 Everything.
###729 That's what makes the soil surveys
###731 so important to any land management decision, from farming to disaster
###735 recovery planning.
###738 I drove out to Lee County to find out
###740 who the people were behind all this work,
###743 and how soils were mapped.
###746 Charlie is a soil scientist who is responsible for the upkeep of about
###750 eleven million acres of soil survey.
###754 Most of this...all of
###755 South Carolina has been mapped,
###758 so what we're doing is updating all
###760 the older soil surveys.
###765 He offered to take us through the process of making a soils map in the
###768 field,
###769 and I asked him to sketch out the day for us.
###773 One of the things we do,
###776 when we go through the process of making the soil map
###783 is to stand and just look at the area
###784 and take in the whole landscape itself. and you can see out in this part of the world,
###786 that some areas of it are concave, some of it are more convex.
###791 So essentially what we do
###792 is to stand out here and note where these areas are,
###795 dig the holes,
###797 identify the soils,
###799 and label them on the map using alpha-numeric symbols.
###802 The finished product looks like this.
###804 This is the same area that we're standing in, and
###808 we can see that these soil lines delineate the different tones on the map.
###816 The first hole we dug was on a slight rise...
###820 we then moved over to a slightly lower area only three hundred feet away and dug another hole.
###824 Charlie showed me the
###826 difference between the two soils that was so close to one
###830 another, and how
###831 land form influenced them.
###835 This soil in the front,
###837 is the "Rains Series".
###838 This soil in the back is the "Nolfork Series" that we looked at earlier.
###842 One of the first things we notice is that the surface of the "Rains" is darker
###849 and that is reflected by the tones on the map.
###852 The other obvious thing is that the subsoil is much grayer.
###854 Where the "Norfolk" series is dominately brown, the "Rains" is dominantly gray.
###858 The grayer
###858 colors immediately below the surface means that this soil formed and still at times
###864 will have a water table
###866 at or near the soils surface.
###870 And although these soils are only 300 feet apart, the
###871 water table is a limiting factor on land management here in the Coastal Plains.
###881 Part of the process of making a map
###884 is to ask the questions
###886 and then to go get the answers.
###888 And once we've identifed some soils in the area,
###891 we begin to understand
###895 that the same soils
###896 more than likely will be occurring in that area.
###899 It looked like Charlie asked and answered a lot of questions -
###903 I don't know how many miles he walked, but he mapped 300 acres that day.
###910 Many of my conservationist friends
###912 tell me that a bad day in the field is better than a good day in the office.
###919 I began to reflect on my new-found appreciation for the work that Charlie and
###923 his colleagues do in the soil survey.
###926 My knowledge of the big picture was taking shape,
###929 but I wanted to see the area we had mapped in the Web Soil Survey for myself.
###938 Back at the office, I went to the Web Soil survey and found the place we had
###942 mapped in Lee county.  I drew my area of interest boundary and went to the soils map tab.
###949 All the familiar soils - Goldsboro, Noboco,
###953 Norfolk and Rains appeared.
###955 I was in the right place.
###959 Charlie had told me that depth to the water table was the limiting factor here,
###964 so I went to the soils data explorer to look at the soils properties.
###969 Sure enough, the Goldsboro and Rains soil had shallow water tables as we had seen in the field.
###976 I then had a look at the soils suitabilities and limitations for land use
###981 to see where the best place to, say,
###983 build a house would be.
###986 It turns out that if I were to do that,
###988 it is better on a Norfolk soil and maybe on a Goldsboro -
###992 all of the other soils were going to be too wet.
###996 I used the shopping cart feature, which was free by the way,
###999 to get a custom soil survey report....
###1002 a little memento of my day in Lee county.
###1009 What I had learned so far
###1011 showed me the broad brush strokes of soils in the landscape
###1015 and how they affect so many of our above- ground land management decisions.
###1020 I now wanted to see the soil from a different perspective.
###1034 To get really upclose and personal with soils,
###1037 I visited with my good friend Richard in his garden.
###1042 We moved into our house about 1984,
###1045 and we have always had the hopes of having a garden. We've tried a whole different
###1050 groups that things, We've always had tomatoes and squash, diffferent
###1053 kinds of squash, zuchinni, yellow squash,
###1055 and uh...
###1057 melons, cucumbers. That's been the basis.
###1061 Now we've gone from about half an inch of topsoil, to about eight and half, nine inches.
###1065 So
###1066 it'll be good for the next people who will be moving in.
###1068 uh... they'll be able to use the soil well,
###1072 ..and now we're trying to do a no-till
###1074 garden. So that's a new step in our direction.
###1079 To take a close look at Richard's soil,
###1082 we took a sample and put it under a microscope.
###1085 The first thing we noticed was that the soil was made up of both
###1089 mineral and organic particles.
###1092 The next thing we noticed was how much mineral particles size varied.
###1096 It turns out
###1097 that mineral particles can be classified by size,
###1100 sands being the largest and clays the smallest.
###1105 Sand is gritty to the touch, while clay has a sticky feel to it.
###1109 Pure silt, not very common in the southeast,
###1112 feels like talcum powder between the fingers.
###1117 The mix of these sand, silt and clay particles in a soil is known as
###1122 soil texture.
###1123 Clayey soils are fertile
###1125 but they don't always drain well.
###1128 Sandy soils on the other hand
###1129 drained very well but are generally not fertile.
###1133 The soil in Richard's garden contains about 40% sand,
###1137 40% silt
###1139 and only 20% clay.
###1142 This would make it a loam -
###1143 the soil texture that combines both good drainage and fertility.
###1151 If you hold Richard's soil in your hand,
###1154 you can see that it clumps together nicely into soil aggregates.
###1158 Soil scientists call this aggregation property soil structure -
###1164 keep in mind that structure is a different soil property to texture.
###1168 Soil aggregates, or soil peds, can
###1171 be classified by size,
###1173 shape and strength.
###1175 Good soil structure is important in soils because water, air,
###1180 nutrients and roots will find it easier to move between soil aggregates than through them.
###1188 One of the surprising discoveries I recently made
###1191 was that in an undisturbed soil, about half of the soil's volume is made up of spaces.
###1197 These spaces are vital to the health of the soil
###1200 because they contain air or water-
###1203 it's in these spaces where soil chemistry and biology are at work.
###1208 Soil scientists tell me
###1210 that these are called pore spaces.
###1212 If they are between sand, silt and clay particles, we call them micropores.
###1218 The much larger spaces we found between soil aggregates are called macropores.
###1223 Macropores are especially important
###1225 because they become the superhighways for air,
###1229 water and nutrients to reach plant roots.
###1232 Richard put his rototiller away a few years ago.
###1236 Less disturbance by rototilling
###1238 has benefited his soil by preserving those pore spaces.
###1243 More spaces for air, water
###1245 and roots in the soil
###1247 means more vegetables on the table for Richard and his family.
###1255 I had always thought of pH as a property of water and not soil.
###1259 Lemon juice has a pH of about three - that's acidic,
###1263 and baking soda has a pH of about nine -
###1266 that's basic.
###1268 Pure water, which is neutral,
###1270 has a pH of seven.
###1272 Now that I realized that more than a quarter of the volume of soil is water,
###1277 this make sense.
###1278 The water chemistry in those pore spaces is
###1281 critical to how plants absorb nutrients from the soil.
###1286 Richard usually gets his soil tested at the local extension,
###1290 but pH test kits like this
###1292 are available online or at local stores.
###1295 ...between six and seven...
###1298 His soil is slightly acidic but, it's in the range from most of his plants
###1301 thrive.
###1303 If the pH is too low his plants will not be able to take up
###1307 nutrients like nitrogen and potassium.
###1310 If the pH gets too high
###1312 his plants would have problems absorbing iron,
###1315 manganese and zinc.
###1317 So keeping that pH in the 6-7 range is really critical.
###1323 As we finished up our visit,
###1325 Richard shared some of his land philosophy with me.
###1329 I believe in stewardship. If..if you're given something can you make it..improve it or
###1334 can it be better for the next person?
###1336 So we've done everything we can to
###1338 help it be someplace that people will enjoy later.
###1344 That got me to thinking.
###1346 Richard's soil is a Cecil -
###1348 that won't change.
###1350 But it was clear that there were some properties in the top six to nine inches
###1353 of Cecil soil that he had improved through good management.
###1358 It means that a Cecil soil could be healthy or unhealthy, depending on how
###1363 it's managed.
###1365 A healthy or unhealthy soil?
###1368 This was a fascinating concept that I had to explore further.
###1387 I spoke to Pam and told her about my experience and asked her if management made
###1391 a difference to the soils.
###1394 She replied with a story from the famous soil scientist and father of
###1397 soil conservation Hugh Hammond Bennett.
###1404 In the early part of his career, in the 1900s, he and a colleague were wandering around,
###1409 when they noticed two pieces of land side by side.
###1412 These two pieces of land looked vastly different, in terms of soil quality.
###1417 It was obvious that these two areas, at one time, had been identical. They had the
###1420 same geology, the same slope, and the same climate.
###1424 However, in one area the soil was soft.
###1427 It was loamy and moist enough that they could dig it with their hands, even in
###1430 dry weather.
###1432 The other area,
###1433 in contrast, was very hard and dry.
###1436 It was almost like a brick. They could not dig it at all.
###1440 The difference between these two was that the soft one, the mellow one, was under
###1444 a dense forest,
###1446 while the other one had been continuously cultivated for decades.
###1450 Mr. Bennett, or Big Hugh, called this his epiphany.
###1454 Big Hugh's epiphany was about how management can change soil function.
###1460 Put in the simplest terms,
###1461 soil function is its ability to moderate water flow and storage,
###1466 to store and recycle nutrients
###1468 and to sustain life.
###1471 In the spirit of Big Hugh's epiphany, I did a simple test to see how well
###1476 soil structure holds together in water,
###1479 it's called teh slake test.
###1481 I took two soils -
###1483 both from the same soils series,
###1486 one was continuously cultivated
###1488 and the other had been under no-till and cover crops for years.
###1493 The no-till soil measured out
###1494 at 3% of carbon-rich soil organic matter,
###1498 the paler, tilled soil at less than
###1501 half a percent.
###1505 It didn't take me long to figure which soil was healthy.
###1509 It's no wonder so many of our Piedmont reservoirs are the color they are.
###1516 The difference in the way the two soils behaved is about glue
###1520 and string. Soil-life... roots,
###1524 earthworms, fungi and bacteria,
###1527 secrete biotic glues. Roots and fungi also form biotic string,
###1532 which works with the glues to form a sticky network that holds soil
###1536 particles together.
###1538 The glue and string is what keeps the pore spaces between the particles open,
###1543 to provide a place for water storage and flow, and to provide a habitat for all of
###1548 the soil organisms.
###1552 This allows water be stored and to move through the soil when it's
###1555 needed.
###1559 The easiest way of damaging the glue and string is by disturbing
###1563 the soil.
###1566 Soil disturbance chops up the
###1568 biotic string
###1569 and allows piranha-like bacteria to gobble up the carbon-rich
###1574 string and the glues,
###1575 turning them into carbon dioxide and releasing them into the atmosphere.
###1581 When i removed the soil organic matter the pore spaces collapsed and I was left
###1586 with empty dirt.
###1589 Any kind of soil disturbance will do this, the more intense, the more of the soil
###1594 will be damaged.
###1597 If Big Hugh were still around he'd have a
###1600 fascinating conversation with today's soil ecologists.
###1605 They'd tell him that the glue and string are part of soil organic matter, which
###1610 consists of decomposable organic material, humus and living things.
###1615 The decomposable organic material is like the pantry for many soil organisms.
###1621 Humus, dark and sponge-like, is a very stable organic substance that remains
###1627 after many soil organisms have used and transformed
###1630 the original decomposable material.
###1634 One of the functions of humus
###1635 is to be a sponge that holds water for drier weather.
###1640 About 5% of the soil organic matter's mass is made up of living things,
###1646 microscopic soil bugs or soil microbes,
###1649 and animals that we can see without a microscope.
###1653 The weight of the microbes alone under one acre of this soil's surface
###1658 is more than this cow-calf pair.
###1662 That's a lot of microbes.
###1667 It's the soil biology that regulates about 90% of the
###1671 soil's function
###1672 of moderating the flow and storage of water, nutrients and energy
###1677 ....in your backyard,
###1678 in the farm field,
###1680 on our planet.
###1686 I still worry about urban sprawl and erosion,
###1689 and the amount of fuel and fertilizer we use to make food.
###1694 But there's good news.
###1695 Soils are resilient and forgiving!
###1699 From the Carolinas to the Dakotas,
###1701 farmers and gardeners are restoring soil health
###1704 by working with nature, not against it...
###1707 they've stopped tilling.
###1708 Completely.
###1710 They've started growing multi-species cover crops
###1713 that feed and cover the soil...
###1715 it's growing them more
###1717 and costing them far less.
###1721 In the cities, they're planting trees and rain gardens,
###1725 restoring old buildings instead of breaking new ground.
###1729 School kids are learning more about soils....
###1732 that's huge.
###1734 In these last few months, I have come such a long way,and yet
###1738 where i stand now, I see how much more I have to learn.
###1742 Sometimes I feel all of this can be overwhelming, but when i think of
###1746 Big Hugh and what he went through,
###1748 I think he'd tell me that there's hope.
###1751 I bet he'd like us to call it "humic hope".
