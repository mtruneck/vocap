0:0:4,433 --> 0:0:5,8
>> Bobson Mercier: 
Haiti, once a


2
0:0:5,8 --> 0:0:7,6
lush land covered in trees.


3
0:0:7,6 --> 0:0:10,433
This part of the Caribbean that
was once known as the Pearl of


4
0:0:10,433 --> 0:0:12,433
the Antilles.


5
0:0:12,433 --> 0:0:15,3
60% was tropical rainforest.


6
0:0:15,3 --> 0:0:18,567
Deforestation has depleted this
pearl, which as devastated the


7
0:0:18,567 --> 0:0:21,567
land, causing soul
erosion, flash floods,


8
0:0:21,567 --> 0:0:23,967
and desertification.


9
0:0:23,967 --> 0:0:29,833
By 1988, only 2% of the land had
tree cover and nothing better


10
0:0:29,833 --> 0:0:32,3
symbolizes a cycle
of poverty like the


11
0:0:32,3 --> 0:0:34,9
process of deforestation.


12
0:0:34,9 --> 0:0:38,167
But the trees are not cut down
for mere sport, but they are


13
0:0:38,167 --> 0:0:41,467
used for life sustaining
purposes like charcoal for


14
0:0:41,467 --> 0:0:43,967
heating and cooking and
wood for the building of


15
0:0:43,967 --> 0:0:46,267
homes for families.


16
0:0:46,267 --> 0:0:48,7
The Haiti Connection has joined
efforts with our Haitian


17
0:0:48,7 --> 0:0:51,433
brothers and sisters to
replenish the land with trees


18
0:0:51,433 --> 0:0:55,1
and cover the mountaintops with
green hats.


19
0:0:55,1 --> 0:0:59,33
The reality is, Haiti will never
be able to be reforested.


20
0:0:59,33 --> 0:1:3,167
Nevertheless, it is still
possible to stop the erosion,


21
0:1:3,167 --> 0:1:6,967
to create many forest, and to
empower young people to protect


22
0:1:6,967 --> 0:1:10,633
the land for their future and
to create a landscape that


23
0:1:10,633 --> 0:1:15,967
shows the depth and the
beauty of its people.


24
0:1:15,967 --> 0:1:41,167
[Singing].


25
0:1:41,167 --> 0:1:54,767
[no dialogue].


26
0:1:54,767 --> 0:1:56,133
>> Roy Lahman: 
You know, all of our studies


27
0:1:56,133 --> 0:1:58,6
and all the things we did before
to get ready to go to Haiti,


28
0:1:58,6 --> 0:2:1,867
we knew that Haiti was called
the Pearl of the Antilles.


29
0:2:1,867 --> 0:2:5,467
That it provided for a third of
the GDP, this little part of the


30
0:2:5,467 --> 0:2:8,433
island, a third of the island
the size of Maryland provided a


31
0:2:8,433 --> 0:2:11,233
third of the GDP for France when
it was one of its colonies.


32
0:2:11,233 --> 0:2:14,3
That's why France was willing to
sell the Louisiana Purchase in


33
0:2:14,3 --> 0:2:15,633
order to keep Haiti.


34
0:2:15,633 --> 0:2:17,3
It's crazy when you think about
it but that's how beautiful


35
0:2:17,3 --> 0:2:22,533
Haiti was at one time and we
recognize and realize that where


36
0:2:22,533 --> 0:2:26,167
once was 65% tropical rain
forest was now less than 2% even


37
0:2:26,167 --> 0:2:27,533
by the time we go there.


38
0:2:27,533 --> 0:2:30,867
And so it's always been in our
heart, I think, when we started


39
0:2:30,867 --> 0:2:33,167
walking with people, we hear
stories, we hear stories about


40
0:2:33,167 --> 0:2:36,1
how beautiful Haiti was and all
that and it is still beautiful,


41
0:2:36,1 --> 0:2:37,33
it's so gorgeous.


42
0:2:37,33 --> 0:2:41,9
But you think such denuded, so
denuded the mountains are so


43
0:2:41,9 --> 0:2:45,67
denuded and poverty is a cruel
mistress, a horribly cruel


44
0:2:45,67 --> 0:2:48,167
mistress or master--which ever
one you want to say, I guess I


45
0:2:48,167 --> 0:2:50,0
should say it's a cruel master,
whatever.


46
0:2:50,0 --> 0:2:52,633
And so with poverty, farmers cut
down the trees.


47
0:2:52,633 --> 0:2:55,5
They cut it down for the number
one culprit, chabon--charcoal to


48
0:2:55,5 --> 0:2:58,167
cook with because they need to
make a living and you can't


49
0:2:58,167 --> 0:3:3,767
blame them.


50
0:3:3,767 --> 0:3:8,33
My definition of deforestation
is actually two-fold.


51
0:3:8,33 --> 0:3:11,433
Okay, one is sort of the
functional sense, meaning when a


52
0:3:11,433 --> 0:3:16,8
forest loses its ability to, to
work as an entity.


53
0:3:16,8 --> 0:3:20,567
What I mean by that is that is
that a forest serves in many


54
0:3:20,567 --> 0:3:21,4
different capacities.


55
0:3:21,4 --> 0:3:25,233
One, it serves as method for
collection rainwater.


56
0:3:25,233 --> 0:3:28,333
In areas they get an awful lot
of rain, particularly if that is


57
0:3:28,333 --> 0:3:33,433
coming at high velocity, you
know, during the tropical storm


58
0:3:33,433 --> 0:3:35,33
or something of that nature.


59
0:3:35,33 --> 0:3:39,67
The forest serves to soak up
that excess moisture and reduces


60
0:3:39,67 --> 0:3:40,533
flooding, so that's one problem.


61
0:3:40,533 --> 0:3:43,3
So deforestation occurs when
enough of the forest is removed


62
0:3:43,3 --> 0:3:48,67
where that function is missing.


63
0:3:48,67 --> 0:3:51,767
Deforestation also occurs,
though, when it leads to--from


64
0:3:51,767 --> 0:3:54,433
an economic standpoint, the lack
of the ability of people to


65
0:3:54,433 --> 0:3:58,9
utilize that for basic needs,
okay.


66
0:3:58,9 --> 0:4:1,9
In other words when they cut
down too many trees, there are a


67
0:4:1,9 --> 0:4:5,967
lack of trees for charcoal
production for example, for home


68
0:4:5,967 --> 0:4:9,367
heating, for building and things
of that nature.


69
0:4:9,367 --> 0:4:12,267
When you cut down all the trees,
particularly in an area where


70
0:4:12,267 --> 0:4:16,167
you have some sort of slope,
that's going to lead to erosion


71
0:4:16,167 --> 0:4:18,533
being advanced.


72
0:4:18,533 --> 0:4:21,733
It's also going to lead to
flooding being a problem.


73
0:4:21,733 --> 0:4:24,533
So people who have built and who
live in these areas, they're


74
0:4:24,533 --> 0:4:27,567
subject to flash floods on
greater bases.


75
0:4:27,567 --> 0:4:31,967
Their fields, if they begin to
farm those fields, are not very


76
0:4:31,967 --> 0:4:35,2
stable, they grow erode very,
very quickly.


77
0:4:35,2 --> 0:4:37,7
And obviously this is not
sustainable situation for a


78
0:4:37,7 --> 0:4:41,733
country that is already--they
have a tenuous ability to


79
0:4:41,733 --> 0:4:43,233
provide for themselves anyway
from an agricultural standpoint


80
0:4:43,233 --> 0:4:46,4
or from an economic standpoint.


81
0:4:46,4 --> 0:4:49,167
So that's one of the major
problems with deforestation.


82
0:4:49,167 --> 0:4:53,933
Another, in a more broader
perspective has to do with, you


83
0:4:53,933 --> 0:4:58,433
know, global temperature and
climate change because these


84
0:4:58,433 --> 0:5:4,33
forests serve as method for
dealing with carbon.


85
0:5:4,33 --> 0:5:6,667
They collect carbon rather than
admit carbon into the


86
0:5:6,667 --> 0:5:10,33
atmosphere, so these are what we
call carbon sinks, are no longer


87
0:5:10,33 --> 0:5:11,767
available to do that job.


88
0:5:11,767 --> 0:5:13,833
So that's kind of the more broad
perspective, a more localized


89
0:5:13,833 --> 0:5:17,367
perspective, increased
flooding, increased erosion


90
0:5:17,367 --> 0:5:20,433
are big problems.


91
0:5:20,433 --> 0:5:22,767
There's a very famous--you can
find this on the


92
0:5:22,767 --> 0:5:26,433
Internet--photos where you see,
they show the boarder line


93
0:5:26,433 --> 0:5:28,967
between the Dominican Republic
and Haiti.


94
0:5:28,967 --> 0:5:31,833
The Dominican Republic, because
that is a protective boarder,


95
0:5:31,833 --> 0:5:35,3
there are plenty of trees on
that side; the other side is


96
0:5:35,3 --> 0:5:36,967
denuded of trees.


97
0:5:36,967 --> 0:5:39,933
There are several reasons for
this, one is because of the lack


98
0:5:39,933 --> 0:5:46,333
of opportunity for many
Haitians, they are forced to use


99
0:5:46,333 --> 0:5:48,933
that lumber for basic needs.


100
0:5:48,933 --> 0:5:52,1
For heating, for building
and things of that nature,


101
0:5:52,1 --> 0:5:54,367
charcoal production.


102
0:5:54,367 --> 0:5:58,33
So they've cut down the trees,
with very little official


103
0:5:58,33 --> 0:6:2,567
oversight, even in resent years
so that's lead to the complete


104
0:6:2,567 --> 0:6:4,767
denuding of that land scape.


105
0:6:4,767 --> 0:6:7,6
Unfortunately, when you do
something like that, you open


106
0:6:7,6 --> 0:6:10,33
the area up to flooding and
flash flooding is a major


107
0:6:10,33 --> 0:6:13,267
problem in much of rural Haiti.


108
0:6:13,267 --> 0:6:15,567
But once again, you can't blame
the people for cutting down the


109
0:6:15,567 --> 0:6:19,433
trees, they need those
resources to survive and, you


110
0:6:19,433 --> 0:6:25,3
know, until another method for
fuel and other types of building


111
0:6:25,3 --> 0:6:28,233
material, till that happens, you
will continue to see


112
0:6:28,233 --> 0:6:34,8
deforestation being a major
problem in Haiti.


113
0:6:34,8 --> 0:6:36,0
>> Roy Lanham: 
So when you begin to look at


114
0:6:36,0 --> 0:6:37,933
this, you begin to think, what
is possible and as we begin to


115
0:6:37,933 --> 0:6:40,2
look at my Haitian brothers
and sisters, once again,


116
0:6:40,2 --> 0:6:43,367
walking with and not doing
for, but walking with.


117
0:6:43,367 --> 0:6:44,3
How keys is that?


118
0:6:44,3 --> 0:6:47,67
And we've learned over the years
that we've found a couple folks


119
0:6:47,67 --> 0:6:50,67
that kind of changed our lives
and how we saw the issue of


120
0:6:50,67 --> 0:6:51,767
reforestation in Haiti.


121
0:6:51,767 --> 0:6:55,67
One was a woman named sister Pat
Dillon, an American, works in


122
0:6:55,67 --> 0:6:57,367
Gros-Morne we met her twelve
years ago now.


123
0:6:57,367 --> 0:7:1,267
She is the Lorax of Gros-Morne
The women loves tries beyond


124
0:7:1,267 --> 0:7:4,667
belief and she believed in
beyond belief that what could be


125
0:7:4,667 --> 0:7:8,233
transformed, how Haiti can be
transformed and Haitians lives


126
0:7:8,233 --> 0:7:11,767
can be transformed if they
can just begin to reforest


127
0:7:11,767 --> 0:7:12,767
if you will.


128
0:7:12,767 --> 0:7:14,567
Now they all know they can't.


129
0:7:14,567 --> 0:7:16,7
The farmers need the land, they
can 't totally reforest by they


130
0:7:16,7 --> 0:7:20,3
can have "ti fore", small
forest, quarter acre forest and


131
0:7:20,3 --> 0:7:22,7
they can begin and begin to do
fence rows and things like that.


132
0:7:22,7 --> 0:7:25,3
And they will begin to save the
land and they begin to work on


133
0:7:25,3 --> 0:7:27,733
this and educate and the whole
bit and what she was doing up


134
0:7:27,733 --> 0:7:30,167
there in Gros-Morne has made
such an impact, we started


135
0:7:30,167 --> 0:7:33,633
working with a group of
individuals called AJGR.


136
0:7:33,633 --> 0:7:35,3
This is the kind of impact they
had.


137
0:7:35,3 --> 0:7:37,667
A group of Haitians, young
Haitians got together and they


138
0:7:37,667 --> 0:7:41,0
wanted then to make their land
more beautiful, to make Haiti


139
0:7:41,0 --> 0:7:43,267
more beautiful for future
generations.


140
0:7:43,267 --> 0:7:45,3
We had the opportunity to begin
to work with them.


141
0:7:45,3 --> 0:7:48,9
And we begin to work with them
on a reforestation project and


142
0:7:48,9 --> 0:7:52,967
it was just a little hillside,
it was a learning center so that


143
0:7:52,967 --> 0:7:55,167
they can teach future
generations about the power of


144
0:7:55,167 --> 0:7:57,967
caring for the earth, caring for
the land.


145
0:7:57,967 --> 0:8:0,67
Being good stewards of what God
has given us.


146
0:8:0,67 --> 0:8:1,7
It was amazing, it was really
cool.


147
0:8:1,7 --> 0:8:3,433
It never really get
off the ground,


148
0:8:3,433 --> 0:8:4,833
as it should of, unfortunately.


149
0:8:4,833 --> 0:8:6,1
These are one of these things
that we've learned when


150
0:8:6,1 --> 0:8:7,967
we've been in Haiti, that
not everything is going


151
0:8:7,967 --> 0:8:9,433
to be successful.


152
0:8:9,433 --> 0:8:11,933
Not everything's always going
to be where we come out the


153
0:8:11,933 --> 0:8:13,7
other end and say, "Wow, look at
us, look what we did."


154
0:8:13,7 --> 0:8:16,633
Naw, some things are going to
fail and maybe something will be


155
0:8:16,633 --> 0:8:19,6
learned, not just on our side,
but also on the side in Haiti.


156
0:8:19,6 --> 0:8:21,833
AJGR and our relationship with
them failed.


157
0:8:21,833 --> 0:8:24,833
We did somethings, we tried,
we tried, we tried, we built a


158
0:8:24,833 --> 0:8:26,633
cistern, we did all these
things, we planted thousands of


159
0:8:26,633 --> 0:8:30,833
trees, you know, but it just
never clicked because it always


160
0:8:30,833 --> 0:8:33,233
came off as us doing for them.


161
0:8:33,233 --> 0:8:37,3
They kind of went there separate
way and guess what, AJGR is


162
0:8:37,3 --> 0:8:39,4
blooming and blossoming and
growing in ways we could have


163
0:8:39,4 --> 0:8:41,467
never imagined, had we stayed
with them.


164
0:8:41,467 --> 0:8:44,167
They began to realize that they
became so dependent on us doing


165
0:8:44,167 --> 0:8:47,8
for them, and we had realized
that we were so frustrated that


166
0:8:47,8 --> 0:8:50,467
actually parting the ways
allowed for some really cool


167
0:8:50,467 --> 0:8:52,667
things to happen with them.


168
0:8:52,667 --> 0:8:54,5
And that's been a cool thing,
but it didn't take away our


169
0:8:54,5 --> 0:8:57,167
desire for reforestation
and to do some real things


170
0:8:57,167 --> 0:8:58,433
with reforestation.


171
0:8:58,433 --> 0:9:1,567
And what happen was, it really
kind of once again, it had


172
0:9:1,567 --> 0:9:3,567
everything to do with
the relationships


173
0:9:3,567 --> 0:9:5,0
first and foremost.


174
0:9:5,0 --> 0:9:9,33
Down there is Barada once again,
and Fonds-Verrettes.


175
0:9:9,33 --> 0:9:12,3
We wrote for a grant, one of our
alums wrote for a grant to see


176
0:9:12,3 --> 0:9:14,833
if we could--with the company
that she had worked with--and to


177
0:9:14,833 --> 0:9:17,3
see if she could get some money
for a reforestation projects.


178
0:9:17,3 --> 0:9:20,833
It was called the ti fore
project, we called it,


179
0:9:20,833 --> 0:9:22,8
Project Lorax.


180
0:9:22,8 --> 0:9:25,167
Lorax is this famous character
from Dr. Seuss, you know, its


181
0:9:25,167 --> 0:9:27,633
kind of speaking for the trees
and we didn't get the grant, we


182
0:9:27,633 --> 0:9:29,833
didn't get it.


183
0:9:29,833 --> 0:9:31,9
But here is what's amazing; the
students said this is too


184
0:9:31,9 --> 0:9:33,7
important because we had talked
to the people in Haiti.


185
0:9:33,7 --> 0:9:36,3
Especially after the floods that
happened that destroyed


186
0:9:36,3 --> 0:9:38,367
Fonds-Verrettes in the area, it
is because they didn't have


187
0:9:38,367 --> 0:9:40,3
trees and they really long for
that.


188
0:9:40,3 --> 0:9:43,33
They long for a partner with
this, so we decided we will,


189
0:9:43,33 --> 0:9:45,433
we'll partner with you but we
said we needed to find a guy on

He believes in


195
0:15:41,433 --> 0:15:43,6
reforesting Haiti.


196
0:15:43,6 --> 0:15:47,267
He knows it can't be all put
back together, he knows that


197
0:15:47,267 --> 0:15:48,767
there can be green hats on every
mountaintop, there can be green


198
0:15:48,767 --> 0:15:50,833
hats that would help with the
watershed.


199
0:15:50,833 --> 0:15:54,567
He knows that on every mountain,
there can begin to look at how


200
0:15:54,567 --> 0:15:58,7
the waters flowing and build
rock walls and put in trenches,


201
0:15:58,7 --> 0:16:1,833
channels so the water just
doesn't wash down the hill, it


202
0:16:1,833 --> 0:16:4,33
can feel up first and then go
down.


203

He knows that they can plant
native trees, trees that can


204
0:16:7,433 --> 0:16:8,267
produce fruits.


205
0:16:8,267 --> 0:16:10,0
They won't cut them down for
charcoal because theirs


206
0:16:10,0 --> 0:16:11,167
another way.


207
0:16:11,167 --> 0:16:15,167
Avocados can give farmers a
source of income, mangos can


208
0:16:15,167 --> 0:16:20,1
give farmers a source of income,
sweet oranges and sour oranges


209
0:16:20,1 --> 0:16:22,5
can give farmers a source of
income, so they won't cut the


210
0:16:22,5 --> 0:16:23,5
trees down.


211
0:16:23,5 --> 0:16:25,933
We begin to look at that, so we
begin to look at it.


212
0:16:25,933 --> 0:16:28,1
And it also brings back native
hardwoods because eventually


213
0:16:28,1 --> 0:16:31,367
they do need--if we're really
going to listen to the Haitian


214
0:16:31,367 --> 0:16:35,3
people and we have, they also
realized we still need to cook


215
0:16:35,3 --> 0:16:39,167
with wood and right now this is
what we've got.


216
0:16:39,167 --> 0:16:42,167
We need to explore some
possibilities but how can we


217
0:16:42,167 --> 0:16:44,833
also be planting some trees that
we know in 15 years, we can cut


218
0:16:44,833 --> 0:16:48,433
down as a source of fuel but use
it as a crop, if you will.


219
0:16:48,433 --> 0:16:51,4
So we've begun to look at that
and we found a tree that they


220
0:16:51,4 --> 0:16:57,367
liked that can work with
that, so why should we deny


221
0:16:57,367 --> 0:16:58,233
them that opportunity?


222
0:16:58,233 --> 0:16:59,433
So working together, walking
together.


223
0:16:59,433 --> 0:17:2,167
So right now its in its infancy
but its working and its


224
0:17:2,167 --> 0:17:3,3
Project Lorax.


225
0:17:3,3 --> 0:17:6,767
We've got too many nurseries,
we've got two distributions


226
0:17:6,767 --> 0:17:7,9
during the rainy season.


227
0:17:7,9 --> 0:17:12,567
These are 5000 tree nurseries,
it's not huge, they are mini


228
0:17:12,567 --> 0:17:15,933
nurseries but then what happens
in May is they--every may during


229
0:17:15,933 --> 0:17:19,67
the rainy season--they give away
20 trees per person, anyone who


230
0:17:19,67 --> 0:17:21,8
can come an get them, 20 trees
per person and they've got to


231
0:17:21,8 --> 0:17:23,9
care for these trees, plant
them, care for them, keep the


232
0:17:23,9 --> 0:17:24,9
goats from eating them.


233
0:17:24,9 --> 0:17:27,3
And then they get visited, they
actually get visited--everybody


234
0:17:27,3 --> 0:17:31,33
that takes the trees get visited
and they see how your trees


235
0:17:31,33 --> 0:17:32,367
doing and you're rated.


236
0:17:32,367 --> 0:17:36,33
And they do it, I think, four
times in six months, they'll


237
0:17:36,33 --> 0:17:37,9
come by and visit you and you
don't know when they're coming


238
0:17:37,9 --> 0:17:38,833
so you have to be ready.


239
0:17:38,833 --> 0:17:42,5
And so they'll come and see how
your trees are doing and this is


240
0:17:42,5 --> 0:17:44,133
to encourage them to keep doing
it.


241
0:17:44,133 --> 0:17:47,33
We've recognized while walking
with Rodrigue is that people


242
0:17:47,33 --> 0:17:50,133
will always take trees but they
won't care for them and the


243
0:17:50,133 --> 0:17:52,3
goats will eat them, we've got
to give them some incentive, the


244
0:17:52,3 --> 0:17:55,0
incentive is food.


245
0:17:55,0 --> 0:18:2,167
Twice a year we have a contest
and the top 20 folks get their


246
0:18:2,167 --> 0:18:8,33
names put in a hat and the first
three people who get their name


247
0:18:8,33 --> 0:18:11,33
pulled will get a bag of rice
and a bag of beans and oil for


248
0:18:11,33 --> 0:18:13,433
their family, they get to
provide for their family.


249
0:18:13,433 --> 0:18:16,133
Food securities a huge issue,
even with farmers, is a huge


250
0:18:16,133 --> 0:18:19,633
issue in Haiti and this gives
them food security, helps them


251
0:18:19,633 --> 0:18:21,3
with food so they can provide
for their family.


252
0:18:21,3 --> 0:18:24,533
And so, if they win, they get
this bag of rice, bag of beans,


253
0:18:24,533 --> 0:18:27,967
oil and we just started the
contest and it worked.


254
0:18:27,967 --> 0:18:28,867
And he goes, "The idea Roy
is..."


255
0:18:28,867 --> 0:18:33,0
this is what's so cool, he goes,
"in six months a different 20


256
0:18:33,0 --> 0:18:33,933
people could be in it."


257
0:18:33,933 --> 0:18:36,433
So it encourages them to keep
doing this so its really


258
0:18:36,433 --> 0:18:38,367
excellent program that...


259
0:18:38,367 --> 0:18:41,933
And what even more important
is education, education


260
0:18:41,933 --> 0:18:43,5
about reforestation.


261
0:18:43,5 --> 0:18:46,567
So we translated this book
called the Lorax and we took it


262
0:18:46,567 --> 0:18:49,433
down there and it in creole
and now their using it


263
0:18:49,433 --> 0:18:50,633
in the schools.


264
0:18:50,633 --> 0:18:53,433
Rodrigue got on the radio,
everybody in Fonds-Verrettes,


265
0:18:53,433 --> 0:18:56,5
everybody knows about the Lorax.


266
0:18:56,5 --> 0:19:1,233
What's so amazing is that on New
Years Eve at a party on New


267
0:19:1,233 --> 0:19:6,0
Years Eve, two thousand people
were gathered and Rodrigue read


268
0:19:6,0 --> 0:19:9,833
the story of the Lorax to
them and how they need to


269
0:19:9,833 --> 0:19:11,633
protect the trees.


270
0:19:11,633 --> 0:19:13,567
Exciting beyond belief.


271
0:19:13,567 --> 0:19:16,233
We never would have thought that
would be possible.


272
0:19:16,233 --> 0:19:19,767
And so our project Lorax now and
reforestation is in its infancy


273
0:19:19,767 --> 0:19:22,2
but we see the possibilities of
where it can go.


274
0:19:22,2 --> 0:19:25,767
We recognize that maybe it's
going to take us to a place with


275
0:19:25,767 --> 0:19:28,7
alternative fuel sources,
already one of them said, maybe


276
0:19:28,7 --> 0:19:31,133
we need to think about
alternative fuel sources, see


277
0:19:31,133 --> 0:19:33,933
they're beginning to think about
it and then we can begin to look


278
0:19:33,933 --> 0:19:34,833
at this.


279
0:19:34,833 --> 0:19:37,733
You know, Brian Flannigan
who's a man who works in Haiti


280
0:19:37,733 --> 0:19:41,3
in reforestation says, "When
you're doing this, what you can


281
0:19:41,3 --> 0:19:42,533
do is start small."


282
0:19:42,533 --> 0:19:43,867
And he goes, "what you're doing
is planting these many


283
0:19:43,867 --> 0:19:45,667
nurseries, you getting people
talking about it and you get


284
0:19:45,667 --> 0:19:49,267
them excited about it and before
you know it, it become theirs."


285
0:19:49,267 --> 0:19:52,133
It becomes their own and they
will begin to find solutions and


286
0:19:52,133 --> 0:19:55,1
they'll begin to see how it can
work and how it can work for


287
