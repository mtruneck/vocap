2
0:0:3,88 --> 0:0:4,894
MALE SPEAKER: Put
your hands up.


3
0:0:4,894 --> 0:0:5,72
HANS: No.


4
0:0:5,72 --> 0:0:6,71
MALE SPEAKER: But
I've got a gun.


5
0:0:6,71 --> 0:0:7,79
HANS: I don't care.


6
0:0:7,79 --> 0:0:10,292
MALE SPEAKER: But it doesn't
make any sense.


7
0:0:10,292 --> 0:0:13,5
HANS: Too bad.


8
0:0:13,5 --> 0:0:14,18
COLIN FARRELL: Every now and
then, you read something and


9
0:0:14,18 --> 0:0:15,4
it slaps you in the face.


10
0:0:15,4 --> 0:0:16,94
It gets you by the back of the
head and slams you off a table


11
0:0:16,94 --> 0:0:18,72
and gives you a kick
in the arse.


12
0:0:18,72 --> 0:0:21,23
It just really takes you
on a wonderful ride.


13
0:0:21,23 --> 0:0:22,17
MARTY: Oh, great.


14
0:0:22,17 --> 0:0:23,33
You know what that it?


15
0:0:23,33 --> 0:0:24,6
Do you know what that is?


16
0:0:24,6 --> 0:0:25,4
HANS: Great.


17
0:0:25,4 --> 0:0:27,93
MARTY: That's just
fucking great.


18
0:0:27,93 --> 0:0:30,5
MARTIN MCDONAGH: I think the
tone is similar to "Bruges."


19
0:0:30,5 --> 0:0:33,11
there's always a degree of
humor running through it.


20
0:0:33,11 --> 0:0:35,96
COLIN FARRELL: "In Bruges"
was funny as fuck.


21
0:0:35,96 --> 0:0:38,42
WOODY HARRELSON: Kind of proved
that he was capable of


22
0:0:38,42 --> 0:0:41,24
not just writing, but really
being a great director.


23
0:0:41,24 --> 0:0:43,88
He makes everybody feel,
you know, part


24
0:0:43,88 --> 0:0:45,4
of something special.


25
0:0:45,4 --> 0:0:46,79
SAM ROCKWELL: He knows exactly
what he wants.


26
0:0:46,79 --> 0:0:50,69
He has a very particular visual
aesthetic, as well as


27
0:0:50,69 --> 0:0:52,58
what he wants going
on emotionally.


28
0:0:52,58 --> 0:0:56,87
CHARLIE: Don't give me that
moany fucking face, OK?


29
0:0:56,87 --> 0:0:58,75
MARTY: Ow!


30
0:0:58,75 --> 0:1:1,9
MARTIN MCDONAGH: This was almost
like a puzzle, like a


31
0:1:1,9 --> 0:1:3,16
gigantic kind of jigsaw.


32
0:1:3,16 --> 0:1:4,379
BILLY: Don't get technical
on me.


33
0:1:4,379 --> 0:1:6,18
MARTIN MCDONAGH: The canvas is
pretty big and cinematic.


34
0:1:6,18 --> 0:1:8,21
ABBIE CORNISH: It had a
comedic edge to it.


35
0:1:8,21 --> 0:1:9,95
BILLY: Who's better than you?


36
0:1:9,95 --> 0:1:9,68
MARTY: Who's better than you?


37
0:1:9,68 --> 0:1:10,27
BILLY: Who's better than you?


38
0:1:10,27 --> 0:1:10,77
MARTY: You're better than me.


39
0:1:10,77 --> 0:1:11,38
BILLY: You're gorgeous.


40
0:1:11,38 --> 0:1:13,165
BILLY: You're the best
I ever known.


41
0:1:13,165 --> 0:1:15,4
BILLY: I wanna jump
inside your pants.


42
0:1:15,4 --> 0:1:17,9
SAM ROCKWELL: There's a
lot of hijinks with


43
0:1:17,9 --> 0:1:17,95
me, Woody, and Colin.


44
0:1:17,95 --> 0:1:20,14
And then me, Chris, and
Colin have to do a


45
0:1:20,14 --> 0:1:21,1
lot of stuff together.


46
0:1:21,1 --> 0:1:21,73
That was a lot of fun.


47
0:1:21,73 --> 0:1:23,44
WOODY HARRELSON: There's
a lot of camaraderie.


48
0:1:23,44 --> 0:1:25,85
But Chris Walken, he's
a fucking legend.


49
0:1:25,85 --> 0:1:29,27
To be able to get up there and
do a scene with Chris Walken--


50
0:1:29,27 --> 0:1:31,81
I just was in heaven.


51
0:1:31,81 --> 0:1:32,91
MARTY: You ain't gonna fight.


52
0:1:32,91 --> 0:1:34,8
What are you gonna do, then?


53
0:1:34,8 --> 0:1:35,35
HANS: Guess I'm gonna die.


54
0:1:35,35 --> 0:1:36,98
MARTY: Friends don't make
their friends die, Hans.


55
0:1:36,98 --> 0:1:40,46
HANS: Psychopathic friends do.


56
0:1:40,46 --> 0:1:42,18
CHRISTOPHER WALKEN: You know,
the thing about movies is that


57
0:1:42,18 --> 0:1:43,74
they're always a surprise.


58
0:1:43,74 --> 0:1:46,16
The other night, we were
shooting a scene out there in


59
0:1:46,16 --> 0:1:51,515
the desert, and this enormous
owl flew right over the set.


60
0:1:51,515 --> 0:1:56,4
For hours, this big owl just
kept floating around.


61
0:1:56,4 --> 0:1:59,304
You're not likely to see that
unless you're making a movie.


62
0:1:59,304 --> 0:2:1,54
COLIN FARRELL: I've never met
anyone like him in my life.


63
0:2:1,54 --> 0:2:3,13
He's so just brilliant.


64
0:2:3,13 --> 0:2:4,79
BILLY: Fucking badass, man.


65
0:2:4,79 --> 0:2:5,84
SAM ROCKWELL: Who--
who do you like?


66
0:2:5,84 --> 0:2:6,78
Who do you like better?


67
0:2:6,78 --> 0:2:7,76
[INTERPOSING VOICES]


68
0:2:7,76 --> 0:2:9,8
COLIN FARRELL: The Irish guy's
interesting, isn't he?


69
0:2:9,8 --> 0:2:9,759
The Irish guy's interesting.


70
0:2:9,759 --> 0:2:10,38
[INTERPOSING VOICES]


71
0:2:10,38 --> 0:2:12,22
SAM ROCKWELL: Very undervalued
actor, that Irish kid.


72
0:2:12,22 --> 0:2:13,96
CHRISTOPHER WALKEN: I didn't
you were gonna do that.


73
0:2:13,96 --> 0:2:15,9
MARTIN MCDONAGH: This one has
got a lot of tenderness and a


74
0:2:15,9 --> 0:2:18,1
big human story at its heart.


75
0:2:18,1 --> 0:2:20,93
BILLY: It's about seven
fucking psychopaths.


76
0:2:20,93 --> 0:2:22,87
HANS: I want to know what
happens at the end.


77
0:2:22,87 --> 0:2:24,5
SAM ROCKWELL: Well, I don't know
if I should reveal that.


78
0:2:24,5 --> 0:2:25,99
That's kind of a plot point.


79
0:2:25,99 --> 0:2:27,24
HANS: Fuck 'em.
