###0 JACI BADZIN: Please welcome to Google New York, Chef Paul
###2 Liebrandt.
###3 [APPLAUSE]
###4 PAUL LIEBRANDT: Thank you.
###5 JACI BADZIN: We're so glad you're here.
###7 PAUL LIEBRANDT: Thank you very much.
###7 JACI BADZIN: It's an honor.
###8 PAUL LIEBRANDT: Pleasure to be here.
###9 JACI BADZIN: So we're going to start at the beginning.
###11 So when and how did your interest in food start?
###16 PAUL LIEBRANDT: When and how.
###19 I would say in my early teens.
###21 I didn't grow up from a food background at all.
###23 So I had no family in the business, as a lot of chefs do.
###28 It's something that they're born into .
###30 So it just happened, growing up in the central London,
###34 I grew mostly at Chinatown, so I guess maybe
###36 that had some connection to food there.
###38 But I would say 12, 13, 14, around that age.
###44 JACI BADZIN: And your first job was
###45 at New York, New York in London.
###47 So besides that being a sign of what was to come--
###50 PAUL LIEBRANDT: Kind of telling, yeah.
###50 JACI BADZIN: Yeah.
###51 What was the biggest challenge of your early years?
###53 PAUL LIEBRANDT: At working in New York, New York?
###55 JACI BADZIN: Yeah.
###58 PAUL LIEBRANDT: When I was a dishwasher--
###60 JACI BADZIN: That's--
###60 PAUL LIEBRANDT: --working illegally,
###62 at 14 years old, because you're supposed to be 16, so I lied.
###65 I'm a tall guy, so they believed me.
###68 But the challenges?
###70 It wasn't really a challenge.
###71 It was fun.
###71 I mean, I was 14 years old, and it was fun.
###76 It's just fun.
###77 JACI BADZIN: That's interesting.
###78 My first job was in a kitchen.
###80 It was actually-- was a waitress.
###82 I don't remember it being that fun.
###83 But I'm glad that you had fun with it.
###84 It's probably why you're this amazing chef.
###87 So you mentioned that you started
###90 working in kitchens at 14.
###92 And you spent a lot of your teenage years
###95 in these restaurant kitchens.
###96 
###99 What are some of the biggest ways
###100 that shaped who you are today?
###103 PAUL LIEBRANDT: Well, I think anybody
###104 that works in the kitchen, in a professional kitchen,
###107 will tell you that it really sharpens you up, especially
###110 in early age when you're surrounded
###112 in a very high pressure, highly detailed environment,
###116 it tends to mature you very quick.
###118 So you tend to see that chefs in general around the globe, when
###123 you meet them they're very sharp.
###124 It's just the nature of the business.
###126 You have to be.
###128 So it matured me very quick, quicker
###129 than I would have done if I had gone the traditional route
###132 of going to college, et cetera, et cetera.
###135 So professionally, I started at 15 and went from there, really.
###141 Didn't stop.
###143 JACI BADZIN: So talking about your teenage years,
###147 not only do you have a passion for food,
###148 but you also have a passion for music.
###150 PAUL LIEBRANDT: Hmm!
###150 Absolutely.
###151 JACI BADZIN: And something that I found very interesting
###153 was that this passion that you'd become a DJ at illegal
###156 raves in the early '90s.
###158 PAUL LIEBRANDT: Yes.
###159 JACI BADZIN: Yes.
###160 Very fun time.
###161 PAUL LIEBRANDT: That was fun, yes.
###164 JACI BADZIN: Do you see any similarities
###166 for how you mixed music back then and how you create food?
###170 
###173 PAUL LIEBRANDT: Well, the process
###175 of DJing an illegal rave is you'd find a space,
###177 break in illegally, phone a number on a Friday night
###180 and everybody would just show up.
###182 So restaurants aren't quite-- well, maybe they are the same,
###185 but restaurants are a little more organized than that.
###189 The mixing part of it, to me it's about taking two things
###193 and creating something new and different
###197 from two things which already existed.
###199 So whether we take a carrot and a parsnip,
###201 and we make something out of it or we
###203 take a rhythm of one track or another,
###206 and we mix them into creating something
###208 else-- the technique and the feel and the sensibility
###210 is the same.
###212 And it's about using your senses and your intuition
###217 with what's there in front of you
###219 and creating your own personal twist on it.
###221 So for me, yeah, there's a lot of similarity
###223 in that aspect of it, yes.
###226 Not the illegal aspect, just the food part of it.
###229 JACI BADZIN: Well, I bet you would
###231 have an amazing underground food dining restaurant.
###234 PAUL LIEBRANDT: Damn, it was fun though.
###235 Yeah.
###236 JACI BADZIN: It was a fun time.
###237 And yes, I am old enough to remember that.
###240 Many of you here aren't.
###241 But it was a pretty fun time.
###244 If you could go back to your early years,
###246 is there a restaurant or location
###247 that you would train at?
###250 PAUL LIEBRANDT: Yes.
###253 There was a very, very famous chef in France
###256 called Alain Chapel, who passed away far too early,
###260 in his early '50s in Mionnay, in the middle of France.
###264 It was before my time.
###266 But that was one of those great, great chefs who really turned
###272 classical French cooking and put his creative spin on it
###275 in a way which nobody had really seen.
###278 I mean, Ducasse trained with him.
###282 This was the gentlemen that really redefined what today--
###285 our generation and the generation
###288 before us really do with food, the creative aspect.
###292 So for me, that is the one gentleman that I would have
###294 loved to-- I would have actually just eaten at his restaurant
###297 while he was still there, but I was far too
###300 young to obviously do it.
###301 But yes, that would be the gentleman.
###304 JACI BADZIN: That's amazing.
###305 So talking about the book for a bit-- so you
###309 say that this book isn't quite a memoir.
###312 And it's not a cookbook.
###314 But you call it a literary tasting menu.
###316 PAUL LIEBRANDT: It's correct.
###317 JACI BADZIN: It's very cool.
###319 Can you tell us what that means?
###321 PAUL LIEBRANDT: Well, a literary tasting menu.
###323 
###327 As with a tasting menu, as with anything
###329 where there are multiple scenes or there
###333 are multiple choruses or rhythms or whatever to it,
###337 it tells a story.
###338 And that's the most important part of it.
###341 A tasting menu, when you have a great tasting menu,
###344 There should be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
###346 And there's ebb and flow to the whole thing,
###348 much the same way as when you go and see an opera or something
###350 similar.
###351 So the book, we wanted to have the same feel to it.
###354 It's not a memoir, because I'm simply not
###356 old enough to have that.
###357 It's a story.
###358 It's not a cookbook, because I didn't
###360 want to do 100 recipes in pictures like a textbook.
###364 So it's something which tells a story in a narrative that
###368 is something that you could follow through
###371 like a tasting menu and arrive at the end
###373 and make your own mind up on whether you enjoyed it or not.
###376 JACI BADZIN: Well, I think it's definitely--
###377 PAUL LIEBRANDT: It's definitely isn't one or the other.
###379 It's something which we tried to do which would--
###382 I wouldn't say break the mold, but I
###383 would say do something different, not do the same.
###386 JACI BADZIN: It's definitely different.
###388 It's definitely-- reading the book,
###390 I hadn't experienced something like that with it's your story,
###394 but then you have these beautiful photos.
###396 And then there's recipes that are ingrained,
###398 but they don't overpower the book,
###400 I think your story definitely shines.
###402 And the images are amazing.
###404 It's a really beautiful book.
###406 There's great imagery, between the food that you create
###410 and these great shots that are taken in the kitchen.
###412 PAUL LIEBRANDT: We had Evan Song,
###414 who's a genius photographer, do the beautiful, beautiful
###417 photographs.
###418 And I said that he makes my job easy,
###420 because he makes it look far better than I think it actually
###424 is.
###425 JACI BADZIN: How long did you work on the book?
###428 PAUL LIEBRANDT: About three years, start to finish.
###430 JACI BADZIN: That actually seems pretty
###432 quick for a book of that size.
###434 PAUL LIEBRANDT: We work quick.
###436 JACI BADZIN: Yes, you do.
###437 Another point in your book, which I thought was interesting
###440 is you reference food as "the food."
###443 Can you describe what that difference
###444 is for you between food and the food?
###449 PAUL LIEBRANDT: I would say it harks back to maybe a more
###452 classic kind of approach, where for me what I do for a living--
###457 I still feel this I will [INAUDIBLE]--
###459 it's there's a reference for what I do.
###461 The food.
###463 The vocational act of the profession
###466 that I've chosen is to nourish, is to feed people.
###469 It's very basic.
###470 It's a basic thing.
###471 But there's something which is very reverent about it.
###474 And for me, the food, I feel honored
###477 to be able to do this for a living.
###480 So when I say the food, I say it in a very respectful
###484 and very almost-- I would say religious term
###489 of it's something which I do to please other people.
###494 It's not just a job.
###495 It's not food.
###496 It's something I hold much higher.
###499 JACI BADZIN: An art.
###500 PAUL LIEBRANDT: No, not an art.
###501 It's a craft.
###502 JACI BADZIN: I was going to say and then I felt art.
###504 PAUL LIEBRANDT: Yes, there's artistic.
###505 Of course there is.
###505 The aesthetic is--
###506 JACI BADZIN: The food on the plate is artwork.
###508 PAUL LIEBRANDT: But this is a craft.
###510 As an artist, I can come in one day and cook a great meal
###512 and then not come back the next day and not have to do it.
###515 Because that's art.
###517 As a craftsman, which I view myself
###519 as a craftsman, albeit maybe an artistic craftsman, every day
###524 I have to come in and deliver to the same level.
###527 Because that's where the consistency and that's where
###529 the expectation for the guest comes in.
###531 So for me that's really what it's about.
###533 And it's a long process.
###535 And it takes decades and decades.
###538 But it's that continual just chipping away.
###540 As somebody who's a sculptor, just everything they do
###543 is just they're chipping away to get the perfect form.
###545 Or a painter.
###547 It doesn't happen overnight.
###549 So for me, the reverence, the rigor, all of that, the food.
###553 JACI BADZIN: The food.
###555 You do it very well.
###556 PAUL LIEBRANDT: We try hard.
###557 JACI BADZIN: You succeed.
###559 So the book guides us through some
###562 of the most famed restaurant kitchens in the world.
###565 Are there any crazy stories that you excluded from the book
###567 that you can share with us now?
###568 PAUL LIEBRANDT: Many, many, many, many.
###569 Yes.
###570 JACI BADZIN: Can you share one of your favorites with us now?
###573 
###574 PAUL LIEBRANDT: But this is going on YouTube,
###576 so there'll be like children and stuff watching this,
###578 so I shouldn't really say anything
###582 that might get me in trouble.
###584 JACI BADZIN: Not to get you in trouble.
###585 Maybe one of your favorite stories
###587 from when you were younger?
###588 PAUL LIEBRANDT: When I was younger.
###590 Gosh, those were the days.
###593 So when I was working back in London, one that I do
###599 remember-- and you know, the great British actors--
###605 they have a very-- there's a quirkiness about them
###608 if you ever meet any of the great British ones.
###610 Richard Harris, who played Dumbledore in the first "Harry
###614 Potter" films was one of those guys.
###617 And I worked at a restaurant called L'Escargot
###619 in London, still there-- beautiful place,
###621 been there since 1927.
###622 Grand, classical-- but a very small one.
###624 Almost like a big townhouse.
###626 So I was in the top restaurant, very small.
###628 And there were only three of us in the kitchen.
###630 And Richard Harris comes in one night
###633 and-- this is obviously before "Harry Potter" films--
###638 and came into the kitchen and proceeded to take his shirt off
###644 and asked everybody if he could bum a cigarette off everybody.
###647 I don't even smoke, so I couldn't help him there.
###650 But took his shirt off-- and I think
###651 he was kind of drunk-- took his shirt off-- it was summer.
###655 He said he was hot-- and when he said can I have a cigarette,
###659 in the middle of us cooking his dinner,
###661 and then walked out of the restaurant, down the street,
###664 asking everybody on the street apparently, so I was told,
###666 and the maitre d' had to chase after him and lead him back
###669 to the restaurant and--
###670 JACI BADZIN: That's amazing.
###670 PAUL LIEBRANDT: --take him upstairs.
###672 But he's no longer with us.
###674 God bless him, so I can say that one.
###675 But there are a lot more but, again, children
###678 might watch this, so I don't want to offend any parents.
###679 JACI BADZIN: That's a great one.
###680 And it's a great "Harry Potter" reference [INAUDIBLE]
###682 do for the kids.
###683 PAUL LIEBRANDT: Yeah, I mean, "Harry Potter," it's all true.
###685 It's all true.
###686 You know, that was my childhood growing up in London.
###688 JACI BADZIN: That's so great.
###690 Something else in the book you talk about
###693 is your experience at a "Star Wars" marathon
###695 when you were a kid.
###696 PAUL LIEBRANDT: Oh yeah.
###697 JACI BADZIN: And how you were drawn to Darth Vader.
###700 And I thought it was an interesting story
###701 to find in a chef's book.
###703 So many Googlers here, I'm sure you know,
###706 are "Star Wars" fans, so I have to ask
###708 why does that moment stand out for you?
###710 PAUL LIEBRANDT: Because it was a "Star Wars" marathon.
###713 
###714 This is what? '83 when "Return of the Jedi"
###716 came out, so I was seven years old.
###719 And it was my birthday.
###720 And my father-- there was an old theatre called the Dominion
###723 Theatre, a very famous theatre at the beginning of Tottenham
###725 Court Road.
###726 And they had the trilogy on.
###728 And they had all three films.
###729 And it had been timed with the release
###731 of "Return of the Jedi."
###733 And my brother said, right, we're
###735 going to go watch a movie.
###736 And I went, great, OK.
###737 So then we went for eight hours or whatever it was,
###740 of just watching all three in a row.
###744 And it was memorable.
###745 Oh yeah.
###746 JACI BADZIN: I can imagine.
###746 PAUL LIEBRANDT: I wouldn't says I
###748 was drawn to Darth Vader in particular,
###749 just the whole vision of the whole thing I think
###752 is quite stunning, quite stunning.
###754 JACI BADZIN: Are you still a fan of the "Star Wars."
###756 PAUL LIEBRANDT: I can't wait for next year or 2016
###760 or whenever it is when they do the new one.
###762 Oh, JJ Abrams's doing it.
###763 I'm very excited about that.
###765 JACI BADZIN: I actually didn't know that.
###766 Did anybody here know that JJ Abrams was doing the--
###768 PAUL LIEBRANDT: JJ is of course--
###769 JACI BADZIN: Yeah, of course, who am I kidding?
###770 Everybody's like yes.
###770 
###773 You're in good company here.
###775 So what was your favorite discovery writing this book?
###778 PAUL LIEBRANDT: It's kind of funny.
###780 It's like when we did the movie.
###782 We filmed the movie over 10 years, 9 and 1/2 years.
###785 So when you talk about your past and then you compile it over
###790 time, and then when you look back on it,
###793 you learn something about yourself.
###795 So whether it be from a narrative point of view
###797 with the book, where I'm talking about things that I hadn't
###800 thought about in years, but for the purposes of this story
###804 that we were compiling here, we were
###806 talking about it, and memories and things.
###808 And the same thing with the movie.
###809 When you look at yourself from a decade
###811 ago-- when you kind of cringe and go oof,
###813 really-- you learn a lot.
###816 Some good, some bad, some things which
###818 inspire you for the future.
###821 My love of Chinese food, I guess,
###823 I know where it comes from now.
###824 JACI BADZIN: Yeah.
###825 PAUL LIEBRANDT: Yeah.
###825 JACI BADZIN: Growing up near Chinatown.
###826 PAUL LIEBRANDT: Yeah, directly opposite.
###827 JACI BADZIN: Yeah.
###828 It's very cool.
###831 What is one cookbook, besides your own,
###834 that people should have?
###835 Well, actually, yours is a literary tasting menu,
###837 but besides that book, what is in a book about food
###841 or a cookbook that people should own?
###846 PAUL LIEBRANDT: One of the first cookbooks
###848 I ever bought, and again, I wouldn't call it
###850 a necessary cookbook, but for me,
###852 what sold me on the profession of what I do now
###855 was "White Heat" by Marco Pierre White, which again,
###859 the visual aspect of it-- because cooking, by nature,
###862 is a repetitive act.
###864 You come every day.
###865 You do the same thing.
###866 And that's good, because that's the nature of the business.
###868 You get better by doing that.
###870 But a cookbook is the same thing.
###873 If it's 100 pages and 100 recipes and 100 pictures,
###877 and you flip through, it can look good
###878 and you can reference something.
###880 But generally you put it back.
###881 You put it back on the shelf.
###882 And it sits in a lovely collection.
###884 "White Heat," at least for me, and I
###886 think for a few other people, was the first book
###889 where it wasn't like that.
###890 There was stunning food shots and stunning recipes,
###893 but Bob Carlos Clarke's beautiful photography
###896 of really capturing what it's like to be
###898 in a professional kitchen.
###900 The sweat, the blood, the tears, the tension,
###903 you see it in the photographs.
###905 It was the first thing for me that
###906 really said I want to do that.
###909 That's what I want to do.
###910 I want to make my life in the kitchen.
###912 And most people would look at it and go "oof,"
###914 because it's gruesome.
###916 I mean, it's grueling.
###917 It looks grueling.
###918 No.
###919 I was enveloped by it.
###921 So for me, I think that is the book
###922 that any young cook should look at.
###925 And it's a very, very realistic view
###927 of what it's like to work in a professional kitchen.
###929 JACI BADZIN: It is.
###930 People say that it was one of-- like you're saying,
###932 it's a first.
###932 PAUL LIEBRANDT: Iconic.
###933 JACI BADZIN: Yeah.
###933 PAUL LIEBRANDT: It's iconic, yeah.
###934 It broke the mold.
###935 It did.
###935 Before that, it was the sort of typical portly French chef
###938 with the giant white hat, standing there like this,
###941 with a cockerel under his arm.
###943 And that's wonderful.
###944 But that's not real.
###945 The realisms are it's sweaty, it's hot, you're tired,
###949 you're undernourished, you have wet hands all the time.
###953 You cut yourself.
###954 People scream at you.
###955 That's the kitchen.
###957 It is what it is.
###959 I mean, that's the nature of the business that we're in.
###961 Thank God it's gotten better than
###964 when I first started over 20 years ago.
###966 But I still think that it's important to understand
###969 the building blocks of why we do what we do.
###972 We're there to cook for people.
###975 JACI BADZIN: Did you see in kitchens and kitchens style,
###980 kitchen etiquette, between London and Europe and New York?
###985 PAUL LIEBRANDT: Very much so.
###986 I think Europe has more-- just simply because Europe
###992 has more of an older lineage when
###995 it comes to culinary history that this country does, just
###998 by the nature of it's Europe.
###1000 I mean, you see that the French brigade system is still
###1005 very much ingrained.
###1006 And the whole reason for me coming to this country,
###1008 and to New York specifically, was
###1010 I wanted to get away from that.
###1012 It's like growing up in the class system in England.
###1015 Your place in life and you'll never get any higher,
###1018 because you're not born into a certain kind of hierarchy.
###1022 It's changed now because, you know, the world changes.
###1024 But kitchens-- the difference is very
###1027 much like that in a kitchen.
###1029 You work for the right people.
###1030 And then you've got the totem pole.
###1032 Here, the refreshing thing is it really
###1034 is-- you make it on your own work for the most part.
###1039 But there's a big difference there.
###1042 Europe.
###1042 I think it's changing more now, in regards
###1045 to more young chefs doing their own personal style, which
###1047 is great.
###1049 And the world is obviously a much bigger place
###1052 in terms of that.
###1053 There's more options now.
###1055 So kitchens have definitely changed a lot, for the better.
###1058 JACI BADZIN: What about when you came to New York?
###1060 What was one of the biggest surprises or biggest challenges
###1063 that you faced as a non-American in a New York kitchen?
###1071 PAUL LIEBRANDT: Well, A, my accent.
###1074 And vice-- and I talk about this in the book-- vice versa.
###1078 Me understanding the American terminology,
###1084 especially working with people from California
###1086 who would have this very sort of bro-speak kind of way, which
###1090 I had no idea what they were saying.
###1092 I remember there's a gentleman that I worked at Poulet
###1095 and he was working on this side of the stove.
###1098 I was working on this side of the stove.
###1100 And he would look at me and say, hey, guy, can I take my guy,
###1105 and write it in your guy?
###1107 When I [STAMMERING]-- like what?
###1110 That translated into can I take this piece of lamb
###1113 and braise it in the choux that you're making?
###1116 I didn't know that, because everyone else seemed to, but I
###1119 didn't.
###1119 True story.
###1120 JACI BADZIN: Wow.
###1121 PAUL LIEBRANDT: Yeah.
###1121 But little things like that.
###1123 And my terminology-- so that actually sounds silly,
###1126 but when you're in a kitchen, it's quick.
###1129 Like this.
###1129 All the time.
###1130 And you've got to be very sharp and on the ball.
###1132 And a lot of it is sensibility, like I say,
###1134 where you have a good team of guys and girls in the kitchen.
###1138 And there's that look.
###1139 It's that sensibility.
###1141 It's a nod.
###1142 And you know, if there's course adjustments--
###1144 service is like going to war.
###1146 You plan, but as soon as you go into it, things change.
###1149 You have to adapt.
###1150 So I think that was actually, for me, a big one.
###1155 And also people eat very quickly here,
###1158 as opposed to Europe, because in Europe, you
###1161 go to a fine restaurant, you're there for the night.
###1163 Right?
###1164 Three, four hours-- normal.
###1166 And that's part decor.
###1167 Here, it's hour and a half, bang.
###1169 You want to go.
###1170 And the volume aspect.
###1172 Fine dining in Europe-- you go to a beautiful restaurant.
###1175 It's 30 covers, 30 people, 40 people.
###1178 That's it.
###1179 Here, it was like 100 plus people.
###1181 I'm like, how do you do it?
###1182 Organization.
###1184 That's how you do it.
###1185 So I think that was a big one, big one for me.
###1188 JACI BADZIN: That's really interesting thing
###1190 about that differentiation and then also-- I mean, it is true.
###1194 I forget how fast we eat.
###1197 Sometimes in New York, a little bit slower, maybe.
###1199 But yeah, it is a definite different experience,
###1203 which translates to the kitchen in such
###1205 a completely different way, in terms of covers.
###1207 PAUL LIEBRANDT: You have to work in a very different way.
###1211 JACI BADZIN: So kind of talking more about present,
###1214 do you feel that dining in general is being repositioned?
###1218 PAUL LIEBRANDT: As far as--
###1221 JACI BADZIN: Fine dining, more of casual dining.
###1224 Do you think that there's still a place for fine dining?
###1227 PAUL LIEBRANDT: Of course.
###1229 Absolutely.
###1230 JACI BADZIN: And if so, how is it being redefined though.
###1232 PAUL LIEBRANDT: You know, this is the thing.
###1235 In any form, there's a building block.
###1238 So art, there's a building block of fine art.
###1241 Music, same thing.
###1243 Winemaking, the folks at Petrus make Petrus wine
###1251 the same way that they did 100 years ago.
###1253 Is it going to go out of fashion 50 years from now?
###1258 I don't think so.
###1259 I think it's going to be harder for them with the climate.
###1261 But I think it's not going to go out of fashion.
###1264 The way I look upon it is like any great art form,
###1267 let's say, like opera, for example.
###1269 100 years ago, people went to the opera.
###1271 When they went to the opera, they
###1272 wore top hat, white gloves, tails, cane,
###1274 because that's what you did when you went to the opera.
###1277 You go to the same opera here that was playing 100 years ago,
###1282 people don't want wear gloves and a top hat.
###1284 But they'll put on a suit and they'll enjoy it.
###1286 But they still want the same feel, the sensibility.
###1290 They want the same idea that they're
###1292 going to see something which is classic and beautiful.
###1295 Fine dining is the same.
###1296 I think there will always be room
###1298 for well prepared, good ingredients
###1302 and expertly crafted product, like a sports car,
###1307 like anything.
###1308 There's room for it.
###1308 But how people approach it and how they want to experience
###1312 it is different.
###1315 You talk about fine dining.
###1316 I think it's very interesting that you look at now,
###1318 the younger people experience fine dining at an earlier age
###1323 now than they did, let's say, 40 years ago,
###1325 where if you went to a fine dining restaurant,
###1328 of like a Michelin three-star, you
###1330 would look at the dining room and it
###1331 would be a certain age group.
###1333 It would be an older clientele, because that
###1335 was what could afford it.
###1337 And that was what was deemed as like that's what you do.
###1342 Nowadays, the dynamic's changed.
###1345 Younger people have more money in their pocket
###1347 than they do 50 years ago.
###1350 They can afford it.
###1351 And people want to experience that.
###1354 And so the way that you change your new rhythm of how
###1358 you do a restaurant of the style that we do
###1361 is you got to make it seem attractive to a younger
###1367 clientele, to a more worldly clientele, because people
###1370 travel around the world now solely
###1371 for gastronomic experiences.
###1374 You go on holiday.
###1375 You have eating experiences.
###1377 So if you go to Hong Kong or Asia-- I mean, I do it too.
###1381 You make a list of the restaurants you want to go to,
###1384 as opposed to maybe 50 years ago, it was sites or a museum.
###1388 Do you understand?
###1389 JACI BADZIN: It's very true.
###1390 That's so true.
###1391 PAUL LIEBRANDT: So the dynamic of how
###1393 we produce what we produce, how we do it, the setting the feel,
###1398 the tone, the touch, all of it, we have to move with the times.
###1401 And I think there's nothing wrong with that.
###1403 That's normal.
###1405 So it's not a question of that fine dining's dying.
###1407 It's not a question that people don't want it.
###1409 It's a question of how you approach it,
###1411 how you deliver it.
###1413 A nicely cooked piece of fish is still a nicely cooked piece
###1417 of fish that people can enjoy.
###1419 It's a question that a lot of people
###1424 would probably disagree with me.
###1426 But that's the way I see it.
###1429 And it's a good thing.
###1429 It's a relevant thing.
###1431 You know, it's forward thinking.
###1433 JACI BADZIN: Do you see this more--
###1434 do you see it being redefined on a global scale
###1438 or do you think that it's going to be national,
###1441 that what we could see in New York
###1442 is going to be vastly different than what we'd see in London?
###1445 PAUL LIEBRANDT: Oh, no, no, no.
###1445 It's a global.
###1446 It's a global.
###1447 If you travel around the world and you eat,
###1449 you see that what people do in London
###1451 is echoing of what we do here in New York, and vice versa.
###1455 And you go to Hong Kong, you see restaurants
###1458 that are echoing what is happening in Spain or France.
###1461 And it's a global thing.
###1464 It's not one particular part of the world or city.
###1468 What I think is very interesting is
###1470 different cultures and different ways of eating
###1474 and the sort of cross pollination
###1475 when it comes to a style of cuisine blending
###1479 with a French-style cuisine.
###1481 For example, Ferran Adria with elBulli
###1485 and the whole Spanish movement of very molecular, very
###1489 technique-driven, very almost pastry-driven style
###1492 of cooking, redefining the entire way that we organize
###1496 our kitchens ourselves and how we approach food
###1499 and taking away the dogmatic view
###1501 of a French-style of eating.
###1504 Now it's morphed into a Nordic kind of thing.
###1507 And the next one is going to be South America.
###1510 And that brings a new world to us as chefs
###1513 and to customers, because that makes ingredients, for example,
###1517 in the Amazonian basin, which it is becoming
###1523 and will be the next big global trend available to people
###1526 globally, which people had no idea.
###1530 I doubt most people-- I mean, maybe
###1532 you have, but have had fresh cashew nut pulp.
###1535 JACI BADZIN: I haven't.
###1536 Anybody here?
###1538 PAUL LIEBRANDT: It's unlike-- you can't describe it.
###1540 It doesn't taste anything like the nut.
###1542 But it's one thing which is very, very specific
###1545 to that part of the world.
###1546 Things like this, which-- it's great.
###1548 It's a good thing.
###1549 It's how we learn.
###1550 It's how food evolves.
###1552 And I think it's a really exciting time.
###1554 JACI BADZIN: That's very, very true.
###1556 I want to try that, for sure.
###1559 Think we can get it here at Google?
###1560 PAUL LIEBRANDT: I'm sure Google can source it.
###1562 JACI BADZIN: [LAUGHS] I bet Google can source it.
###1564 
###1566 So in this digital age, how do you
###1569 see technology changing the way you cook
###1571 and how you approach food?
###1574 Do you see it having any effects on how
###1575 the kitchen is run concurrently?
###1579 PAUL LIEBRANDT: Absolutely.
###1581 Technology has always gone hand in hand with cooking,
###1584 whether it be the hard equipment that we use in the kitchen
###1587 or whether it be the precision elements like sous vides,
###1591 for example.
###1593 The apparatus to get good consistent results
###1597 is now more affordable.
###1598 It's easy to use.
###1600 | I think that right there is technology working
###1604 for the betterment of us as chefs.
###1607 And then we pass our results on to the consumer.
###1609 So they have experience in the hands of a skilled chef.
###1613 I think what is very interesting is the sensory aspect of dining
###1618 and technology and how that translates to the future,
###1622 and how it will translate to the future.
###1624 Andoni just at Madrid Fusion presented on this app
###1630 that you can smell.
###1633 JACI BADZIN: Wow.
###1633 PAUL LIEBRANDT: Like scratch and sniff kind of thing
###1635 on your phone.
###1635 JACI BADZIN: No way.
###1636 PAUL LIEBRANDT: Yeah.
###1637 That you can plug it in, and you can scratch it and it will give
###1640 you smells like when you're reading a book.
###1643 I'm not saying that we're all going to do that,
###1645 but I think at least it's an interesting idea, that
###1648 can morph into something else.
###1650 I think if you look at, let's say, the espuma kind of stuff,
###1654 a siphon, like a cream dispenser.
###1657 20 years ago, Ferran was the first guy really
###1660 to really utilize that.
###1661 A whipped cream dispenser with a cartridge which you put in,
###1665 which was used for whipped cream, and flavor it, and then
###1667 doing hot and cold and different things.
###1670 It's a whip cream dispenser.
###1673 Nowadays, any modern kitchen globally has one.
###1676 Because it's the same as a pot or a pan.
###1679 You have to have one, because it's
###1681 become part of that necessary apparatus.
###1685 So I think that was technology right there,
###1687 and how it led into.
###1688 Sous vide is becoming or has become, in every modern kitchen
###1693 around the globe, the same thing.
###1694 So it's very, very important.
###1698 We use it, always have done.
###1700 I think it's important.
###1701 But ultimately, the best technology is what's in here.
###1705 And what--
###1705 JACI BADZIN: What's there and here.
###1707 PAUL LIEBRANDT: Yes.
###1707 Exactly.
###1709 JACI BADZIN: So along the lines of technology,
###1713 not so much technically speaking,
###1716 but this film-- I want to bring up the film that you did.
###1720 And the documentary that was made about you
###1723 and the current day and age, how everything is so real time,
###1727 and everyone wants to be on TV or film,
###1730 or have that kind of fame after you, if you will, celebrity.
###1735 What would you tell them about your experience
###1738 of being in an HBO documentary?
###1740 
###1743 Did it have any effect on your life as a chef, on your career?
###1749 Was there parts of it that you wish would not have been--
###1753 PAUL LIEBRANDT: First, let me explain,
###1755 because we did this documentary but A, when we started
###1760 filming-- the director, Sally, started filming,
###1762 it was never meant to be a documentary.
###1765 It was simply she's a documentary maker,
###1768 and she just wanted to film.
###1770 It wasn't a grand scheme of compiling everything and making
###1773 a movie.
###1774 She just was interested in-- she didn't really know.
###1778 And it went on for years and years.
###1781 And I mean like five years into it,
###1782 I forgot that we're even doing something.
###1784 I was just-- that's Sally.
###1787 She's filming.
###1789 One day she'll do something with the 500 hours of footage
###1792 she has.
###1793 Ava and her classmates talk about the fives years
###1795 compiled it into a movie.
###1796 And HBO saw it as a pre-screening
###1802 and bought it and sold it.
###1803 So we didn't start out-- and there
###1806 was no plan to say this is going to be on TV,
###1809 and we want to be famous or none of that,
###1811 which is very different from Food TV, so you speak.
###1815 And I don't strive for that personally.
###1819 So I think there's a balance there.
###1820 There's a difference.
###1821 Again, we made a movie, and it was really
###1824 a story about a young person in a big city--
###1828 and it could be someone who's in any industry, especially
###1832 any creative industry, artist or musician or actor or whatever--
###1836 and the trials and tribulations of just living life and that
###1838 was it.
###1840 And so it was like in a narrative.
###1842 I thought they did a fantastic job on it.
###1845 And I think that it-- I wouldn't say changed my life at all.
###1851 We get recognized a lot, which is sometimes fun
###1855 and sometimes not.
###1857 But I think more than that, I'm happy to share
###1860 my life and my story with other people
###1862 out there in the world who, as when we put the movie out,
###1866 I find are very similar.
###1867 There's a lot of people out there globally.
###1869 And we toured with the movie-- Europe
###1871 and South America and Australia.
###1874 And there's a lot of symbiotic things with other people
###1878 other cultures, other profession.
###1880 They can say, hey, I thought it was just me.
###1883 I'm in that position now.
###1885 How do you, and looking at the film,
###1888 help them give them inspiration to-- maybe, I don't know,
###1893 go through the door that they were not willing to go through.
###1895 So for me, that's the most important part of it.
###1899 And a young chef that's saw it and said,
###1901 you've inspired me to want to do this and really
###1905 do it for a living.
###1906 I was having second thoughts.
###1907 It's a hard business, that kind of thing.
###1909 And if anything, I think that is the bigger payoff for me,
###1914 personally.
###1916 I think that's nice, giving back, you know.
###1920 JACI BADZIN: So you have done a movie, written a book.
###1924 You've been working in restaurants
###1925 since you were 14, 15.
###1929 You were a DJ.
###1932 What could possibly be next?
###1934 What is next?
###1936 PAUL LIEBRANDT: Well, I'm training
###1938 to be an amateur barber, actually.
###1940 JACI BADZIN: Really.
###1941 PAUL LIEBRANDT: No, I'm [INAUDIBLE].
###1943 I'm just joking.
###1944 JACI BADZIN: I was like, naturally.
###1946 And you're going to spin the music in your barber shop too.
###1948 PAUL LIEBRANDT: I know, whilst frying some eggs.
###1951 You know, look, ultimately, I'm a chef.
###1955 I'm a cook is the way I view myself.
###1958 I get a thrill every day when I-- and I have
###1962 my guys here and my girls there, and they'll tell you,
###1965 I get that thrill of walking in and standing next
###1968 to them, and the touch, the taste, the feel and cooking
###1971 and in seeing the plate go out and looking at the customer
###1974 and seeing their reaction and the emotion in that first taste
###1977 and the smell and the smile, and that kind of sit back
###1981 and they think.
###1981 And then you see it.
###1983 You see it when you feed someone and the joy you can bring.
###1987 That is my goal is to continue doing that,
###1990 because that's the business that I'm in.
###1992 
###1996 If the barber thing takes off, I don't know.
###1998 But I think ultimately, I'm a cook at heart.
###2002 I'm just a cook.
###2004 JACI BADZIN: Well, a very skilled and amazing
###2007 artistically-crafted cook at that.
###2010 So I've just got a couple more questions here.
###2012 And we're going to open it up for Q&A just a couple minutes,
###2015 and there's mics in the audience.
###2017 Anybody have any questions?
###2019 So I like to wrap up these interviews
###2022 with a "finish this sentence" style of approach.
###2027 So I've got a couple here for you.
###2029 PAUL LIEBRANDT: Please.
###2030 JACI BADZIN: Today is Abraham Lincoln's birthday.
###2033 If you were to cook him a birthday dinner,
###2035 what would it be?
###2036 PAUL LIEBRANDT: Well, it would have to be something British,
###2038 wouldn't it?
###2039 Maybe like a revolutionary hot pot or somebody like that.
###2042 JACI BADZIN: I like that.
###2043 PAUL LIEBRANDT: A red coat hot pot.
###2045 JACI BADZIN: A red coat hot pot.
###2046 PAUL LIEBRANDT: Yeah.
###2047 JACI BADZIN: I think you should do it.
###2049 The bank or music that best represents your food is?
###2053 
###2056 PAUL LIEBRANDT: Two.
###2057 Nine Inch Nails, The Cure.
###2059 JACI BADZIN: Nice.
###2061 Your favorite American food is?
###2063 PAUL LIEBRANDT: Lobster roll.
###2065 JACI BADZIN: Oh, that's a good one.
###2066 PAUL LIEBRANDT: Oh yeah.
###2067 A warm lobster roll?
###2067 JACI BADZIN: You like the warm?
###2069 PAUL LIEBRANDT: Oh, yeah.
###2070 JACI BADZIN: I like them both.
###2071 PAUL LIEBRANDT: Slightly toasted, little bit of butter,
###2073 soft bun, sweet, slightly briny lobster fresh out of the ocean,
###2078 little bit of mayo-- oh!
###2079 JACI BADZIN: You're really making
###2080 me want a lobster roll right now.
###2081 PAUL LIEBRANDT: I'm leaving, I'm leaving.
###2082 That's it.
###2083 JACI BADZIN: Let's book over to Chelsea Market.
###2085 PAUL LIEBRANDT: I'm going to go to that lobster
###2085 place in Chelsea Market.
###2086 JACI BADZIN: Exactly.
###2088 Your favorite DJ is?
###2091 PAUL LIEBRANDT: Carl Cox, DJ Hype, two of them.
###2094 JACI BADZIN: Yes, so good.
###2094 PAUL LIEBRANDT: That's like very old school British DJs.
###2097 JACI BADZIN: So good.
###2098 PAUL LIEBRANDT: Very good.
###2099 JACI BADZIN: Your favorite type of cuisine to eat?
###2102 PAUL LIEBRANDT: Japanese food.
###2103 
###2106 JACI BADZIN: What is your favorite restaurant
###2108 that people should know about?
###2110 PAUL LIEBRANDT: That people should know about.
###2111 JACI BADZIN: That you're willing to let people in on.
###2113 PAUL LIEBRANDT: Hmm.
###2114 
###2117 Anywhere globally or just--?
###2118 JACI BADZIN: Sure.
###2119 PAUL LIEBRANDT: Globally.
###2119 JACI BADZIN: Globally.
###2120 If it's going to be on YouTube, let's let people know.
###2122 PAUL LIEBRANDT: I see.
###2123 OK, well, I think personally, because it
###2129 has such a big impact with me, Pierre Gagnaire in Paris.
###2133 JACI BADZIN: Gagnaire.
###2133 PAUL LIEBRANDT: Pierre-- thank you-- Pierre Gagnaire
###2136 because that man redefined the way I think about what I do.
###2141 So I would say for me that's closest to my heart.
###2144 Magic, real magic.
###2145 JACI BADZIN: Is there a specific dish
###2147 that people should get there?
###2148 PAUL LIEBRANDT: No, it changes all the time.
###2149 JACI BADZIN: OK.
###2150 I'm adding that to my list of places to eat when I got.
###2153 PAUL LIEBRANDT: Please.
###2155 JACI BADZIN: And the last question is let's say,
###2159 you've just finished a grueling day.
###2161 You're tired, you're exhausted.
###2163 What do you eat at the end of the shift?
###2165 And what do you drink more importantly?
###2167 PAUL LIEBRANDT: Drink water.
###2169 JACI BADZIN: Water?
###2170 PAUL LIEBRANDT: Water.
###2171 And I would say to eat, I like sushi.
###2178 Yeah, sashimi and sushi at 1 o'clock in the morning
###2181 is the perfect time.
###2183 It really is.
###2184 JACI BADZIN: That's good to know.
###2187 Well, thank you so much.
###2188 If anybody has any questions, we're going to open it.
###2191 I think you're up.
###2192 AUDIENCE: Hi.
###2193 First I want to say thank you.
###2195 The Elm was somewhere in my top four favor meals of last year.
###2199 It's really difficult to actually order those,
###2200 but it was absolutely wonderful, and I hope to come back soon.
###2203 PAUL LIEBRANDT: Thank you very much.
###2205 AUDIENCE: And normally, every chef that comes here,
###2206 I ask them whether or not they consider
###2207 themselves a craftsman or an artist?
###2209 But you've already took that.
###2210 So my back-up question is what is your favorite ingredient
###2214 that you don't get to use often, either
###2215 whether it's because the general public dislikes it,
###2218 it's scarce, it's too expensive?
###2219 
###2224 PAUL LIEBRANDT: Personally speaking, I think,
###2227 shellfish and fish for me are my favorite ingredients
###2230 to work with.
###2231 And of that, I would say there's a species of lobster called
###2240 a cigar de mer, which is not a very widely used lobster, which
###2244 you get from the Mediterranean.
###2246 And it's a known as a slipper lobster.
###2249 It's very expensive, very seasonal.
###2252 I only ever used it in France at Pierre Gagnaire.
###2255 And it's a very rare item, but the flavor
###2258 is like eating vanilla.
###2259 It's stunning.
###2261 So that would be one of them.
###2263 Yes.
###2264 JACI BADZIN: Nice.
###2266 Well, thank you so much, Chef, for coming in.
###2268 PAUL LIEBRANDT: My pleasure.
###2269 JACI BADZIN: It was such a pleasure to have you here.
###2271 PAUL LIEBRANDT: Thank you.
###2272 JACI BADZIN: And I want to--
###2274 [APPLAUSE]
###2277 JACI BADZIN: Chef has agreed to sign some books at the end.
###2280 So you guys are welcome to come up,
###2282 and we'll conclude the speech.
###2285 PAUL LIEBRANDT: Thank you very much.
###2287
