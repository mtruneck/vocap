###25 [strings playing "all along the watchtower"]
###165 Male announcer: ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
###167 Today it is my distinct pleasure
###168 To introduce a man who is recognized--
###170 The battle over evolution is only one skirmish
###173 In a much larger war.
###176 Science simply makes no use of the hypothesis of God.
###183 Ask yourself, what has intelligent design given us? Nothing.
###188 We cannot accept intelligent design
###191 As an alternative scientific theory.
###195 They will never accept that we have a better argument.
###198 They just pester us, and they waste our time.
###204 Announcer: ...Variety of topics, ranging from economics, civil rights,
###208 To how not to ruin your life in ten easy steps.
###210 Today, ben is speaking on the topic
###213 That has become increasingly important to him over recent years.
###217 While ben has always been an ardent supporter of science,
###220 Lately he has noticed an alarming trend
###222 In the scientific establishment
###224 That could have dire consequences
###226 For every american.
###229 Without further ado,
###230 Please join me in giving a warm welcome
###232 For mr. Ben Stein.
###236 [audience applauding]
###238 Ben stein: thank you.
###240 Thank you very much. Thank you very, very much. Thank you.
###243 Thank you very much, everybody.
###246 Thank you very much, gangstas.
###248 Thank you very, very much.
###253 Freedom is the essence of america.
###255 We're talking about freedom of speech,
###258 Freedom of assembly,
###260 Freedom from fear, freedom of religion.
###264 Martin luther king said,
###265 "america is essentially a dream,"
###268 And he said it is a dream of freedom and equality.
###271 Freedom is the way to equality.
###273 And america simply would not be america without freedom.
###277 In every turning point in our history,
###280 The decision has always been about freedom.
###284 [stein narrates] freedom is what makes this country great.
###286 Freedom has allowed us to create, to explore,
###291 To overcome every challenge we have faced as a nation.
###295 But imagine if these freedoms were taken away.
###299 Where would we be? What would we lose?
###302 Well, unfortunately, I no longer need to imagine.
###306 It's happening.
###307 We are losing our freedom
###309 In one of the most important sectors of society--
###312 Science.
###313 I have always assumed
###315 That scientists were free to ask any question,
###318 To pursue any line of inquiry
###320 Without fear of reprisal,
###322 But recently i've been alarmed to discover
###325 That this is not the case.
###327 It all began when I met
###329 Evolutionary biologist richard sternberg
###332 In washington, d.C.
###333 His life was nearly ruined
###335 When he strayed from the party line
###337 While serving as editor of a scientific journal
###340 Affiliated with the prestigious
###342 Smithsonian museum of natural history.
###345 Your office was over there?
###347 That's correct.
###348 This here is the west wing.
###350 Directly ahead of us is the west wing
###351 Of the natural history museum.
###353 So now you're not there anymore
###354 Because you were a bad boy.
###356 No, i'm not. No, I was exiled.
###357 You were a bad boy.
###359 You questioned the powers that be.
###363 [typewriter clacking]
###366 What was dr. Sternberg's crime?
###369 He dared to publish an article by dr. Stephen meyer,
###373 One of the leading lights
###374 Of the intelligent design movement.
###376 The paper ignited a firestorm of controversy
###379 Merely because it suggested intelligent design
###382 Might be able to explain how life began.
###385 As a result, dr. Sternberg lost his office,
###388 His political and religious beliefs were investigated,
###392 And he was pressured to resign.
###394 The questioning of darwinism
###395 Was a bridge too far for many.
###399 The mentioning of intelligent design
###402 That occurs at the end of the paper was over the top.
###407 And I think the intelligent design proponents
###411 Have raised a number of very important questions.
###414 And you wanted to get those questions
###416 Brought up and discussed.
###417 - placed on the table. - placed on the table.
###419 People were so upset about it.
###422 They were so upset that you could see their--
###424 They had a physical emotional reaction.
###426 Wow.
###428 They were saying
###430 That stephen c. Meyer is a well-known Christian,
###434 That stephen c. Meyer is an intelligent design proponent,
###437 That stephen c. Meyer is a republican.
###440 It was all couched in terms of
###441 Religion, politics, and sociology.
###445 The way the chair of the department put it
###448 Is that I was viewed as an intellectual terrorist.
###452 Terrorist?
###454 Because of giving the topic
###458 Of intelligent design some modicum of credibility.
###464 What happened to dr. Sternberg was terrible,
###466 But surely it was just an isolated case.
###468 I was still pretty skeptical,
###470 So naturally I checked in with the head
###472 Of the skeptics society, michael shermer.
###475 So I can't prove there is no God,
###478 Or yahweh in your case,
###480 Any more than I can prove there is no isis, zeus,
###483 Apollo, brahma, ganesha, mithras, allah,
###486 Or for that matter, the flying spaghetti monster.
###489 And think about just one thing:
###491 Why would the aliens look like this?
###493 - these are bipedal-- - king: who drew that?
###497 Shermer: skepticism... It's not a position you take.
###499 It's just an approach to claims.
###501 This one's called the borderlands of science: where sense meets nonsense.
###505 Is intelligent design nonsense?
###507 Well, it's unproven,
###509 So in that sense it's nonsense.
###511 So I would put it in the sort of shaded areas
###513 Between good, solid science and total nonsense.
###516 You know, it's sort of three quarters of the way toward the nonsense side.
###521 Stein: but you think, nevertheless,
###523 People should be allowed to speak about
###525 And publish papers about it.
###526 They are free to write and publish and be heard
###528 In public forums and go to conferences
###530 Just like everybody else does.
###532 What if a person published something, say, at the smithsonian
###535 In favor of intelligent design and lost his job over it?
###539 I mean, it had been peer-reviewed and published
###543 And then he lost his job over it anyway.
###545 What about that situation?
###547 Well...I think that particular situation,
###549 There was something else going on.
###550 - what was going on? - I don't know.
###552 I mean, I don't know because I don't know,
###553 But I think there had to be something.
###556 People don't get fired over something like that.
###558 You roll up your sleeves, you get to work,
###560 You do the research, you get your grants,
###562 You get your data, you publish,
###564 And you work your butt off,
###565 And that's how you get your theories taught--
###567 What if you try and try and roll up your sleeves
###569 And go to work and work your butt off,
###571 And they say, "we're going to fire you
###573 If you even mention the word intelligent design"?
###575 I don't think that's happened. Where is that happening?
###577 Filmstrip narrator: george mason university--
###579 Throughout its 50-year history,
###581 Our mission has remained clear--
###584 To prepare a diverse population of students
###586 To think and to grow
###589 In a climate of unbridled academic freedom.
###592 [typewriter clacking]
###593 Stein: after dr. Caroline crocker simply mentioned
###596 Intelligent design in her cell biology class
###599 At george mason university,
###601 Her promising academic career came to an abrupt end.
###605 My supervisor invited me into his office.
###608 He said, "i'm going to have to discipline you
###611 For teaching creationism."
###613 And I said, "I mentioned intelligent design
###615 "on a couple of slides,
###616 But I did not teach creationism."
###618 He said, "nonetheless, you have to be disciplined."
###620 At the end of the semester, I lost my job.
###624 Not only did this well-loved professor
###626 Lose her job at george mason,
###628 She suddenly found herself blacklisted,
###630 Unable to find a job anywhere.
###633 So whenever I interviewed for a job,
###636 I would be offered it usually on the spot.
###638 Since this has happened
###640 And since people can google my name,
###644 I'm finding that when I send my credentials,
###647 I do get interviews-- I get many interviews--
###650 But I never get offered a job.
###652 I don't tell them about my--
###654 About my, uh, "science sin."
###657 [bell tolling]
###659 I was only trying to teach what the university stands for,
###664 Which is academic freedom.
###668 Egnor: there's nothing to be learned in neurosurgery
###670 By assuming an accidental origin
###674 For the parts of the brain that we work on.
###676 Stein: it wasn't just biologists
###678 Who were feeling the darwinist wrath.
###681 When neurosurgeon michael egnor
###683 Wrote an essay to high school students
###685 Saying doctors didn't need to study evolution
###688 In order to practice medicine,
###690 The darwinists were quick
###692 To try and exterminate this new threat.
###694 A lot of people in a lot of blogs
###696 Called me unprintable names that were printed.
###699 [laughs]
###700 There were a lot of very, very nasty comments.
###703 Other people suggested
###704 That people call the university I work at
###706 And suggest that perhaps it's time for me to retire.
###709 I realized when I kind of went public
###712 With my doubts about the adequacy of darwin's theory,
###715 You know, that I would encounter criticism.
###718 What has amazed me is the viciousness
###721 And the sort of baseness of it.
###726 I'm an old guy. I have tenure.
###728 I'm academically safe.
###729 But the young people
###731 And what is happening to them in america right now
###734 Because of this scientism gulag
###736 Is really terrible.
###738 Apparently professor marks
###740 Was not as safe as he thought.
###742 A few months after this interview,
###744 Baylor university shut down his research web site
###747 And forced him to return grant money
###750 Once they discovered a link
###751 Between his work and intelligent design.
###754 In order to attract grants, you have to market yourself.
###757 So you put up sites and call yourself
###759 "labs" and "groups" and things like that
###761 In order to get visibility.
###762 And in my entire experience in academia
###765 I never went to any superior
###767 And asked them any permission
###769 To put up any of these labs.
###771 So the fact that this was singled out,
###774 Let alone shut down, is jaw-dropping. It's astonishing.
###778 I have never been treated like this in my--
###782 About 30 years in academia.
###784 Shut up, you freak! I said shut up!
###788 [echoing] it's a madhouse!
###791 If you peel back the onion,
###793 I think that there's no doubt
###795 That the center of this is my work
###798 In what some would call intelligent design.
###802 Dr. Gonzalez: people really get emotional about this.
###805 Whenever you say "intelligent design" in a room of academics,
###809 Them's fighting words.
###812 Creationists!
###813 Astronomer guillermo gonzalez
###815 Found himself in a fierce shootout
###818 With iowa state university,
###820 Following the publication of his book
###822 Arguing that the universe is intelligently designed.
###825 Despite a stellar research record
###828 That has led to the discovery of several planets,
###831 His application for tenure was denied,
###834 Putting his career in jeopardy.
###835 I worried about my tenure a little bit in 2005
###840 When the petition was being circulated
###843 Because I viewed that as a strategy
###845 Of hector avalos and his associates
###847 To try to poison the atmosphere on campus against me
###850 Because he knew I wasn't tenured yet
###852 And I was very vulnerable.
###853 I have little doubt that I would have tenure now
###855 If I hadn't done any professional work on intelligent design.
###858 Dr. Gonzalez had this advice for scientists
###862 Who might be thinking about following his example.
###865 If they value their careers--
###867 [laughs] they should keep quiet
###869 About their intelligent design views.
###871 We know there are times and places to be quiet
###874 And other times and places
###875 When we can make noise if we want to.
###878 - filmstrip narrator: will you show us? - of course.
###880 Boys and girls,
###882 How would you like to show
###883 Some of the ways we know of being quiet?
###886 Man #1: it's the kind of thing where you just learn to keep your mouth shut.
###889 Stein: in addition to those scientists
###891 Who were willing to appear on camera,
###892 We encountered many more who didn't dare show their face
###895 For fear of losing their jobs.
###898 Man #2: you use an intelligent design perspective
###900 To get the research done,
###902 But you're not allowed to talk about it in public.
###905 Man #3: and so there is definitely incentive, if you think about it,
###908 For people to remain within the mainstream.
###910 Man #4: you know, "what's he up to?
###912 What is he thinking? Is he one of them?" that kind of thing.
###914 Man #5: if I write "intelligent design,"
###916 They hear "creationism,"
###918 They hear "religious right," they hear "theocracy."
###922 So it appears mr. Shermer, the self-styled skeptic,
###926 Was wrong on this one.
###927 Intelligent design was being suppressed
###930 In a systematic and ruthless fashion.
###932 But maybe intelligent design should be suppressed.
###935 I didn't like what was happening to these scientists,
###938 But on the other hand,
###939 We don't want our kids being taught
###940 That the earth is flat
###941 Or the the holocaust never happened.
###944 It was time to ask the scientific establishment
###946 What was so bad about intelligent design.
###950 Intelligent design people are not genuine scientists.
###952 Intelligent design is a racket.
###954 It's just propaganda.
###956 The only intelligent thing about it
###958 Is to have got people to call it that.
###960 It's really very stupid, as well.
###962 Everybody knows science education
###964 In america is appalling.
###966 What we don't need at this time
###968 Is intelligent design in the classrooms.
###970 To present intelligent design
###972 Stunts their educational growth.
###975 It stunts their intellectual growth.
###977 But what I don't understand
###979 Is how these animals could've been on earth
###980 Millions of years before man
###982 When the bible says the whole earth was created in only six days.
###985 It wasn't just the educational aspects of intelligent design
###989 That had scientists concerned.
###991 Many suspected the movement masked a much larger agenda.
###995 Intelligent design is a set of excuses
###998 To squeeze creationism into the classrooms.
###1000 Get intelligent design in the schools today,
###1003 And we can have school prayers tomorrow.
###1006 Chorus:  hallelujah
###1008  hallelujah
###1009 Stein: any other complaints?
###1011 Can you imagine anything more boring?
###1016 The boredom attached to id is supreme.
###1020 It is so boring
###1022 That I can't even bother to think about it much any more.
###1026 It's just utterly boring.
###1030 John paul young:  love is in the air
###1032  everywhere I look around
###1037  love is in the air
###1039  every sight and every sound
###1045 Stein: love was in the air, all right,
###1047 But none of it was directed toward intelligent design.
###1050 There seemed to be a lot to hate about id,
###1052 And nearly all of that hatred was focused on one place.
###1056 The people in the-- from the discovery institute--
###1060 The people who are doing the intelligent design--
###1062 They're all varnish and no product.
###1065 The discovery institute is a propaganda mill.
###1068 It's a-- it's an institution
###1070 Designed to suck in money from religious investors
###1073 And turn it into a sanitized, somewhat secular version
###1078 Of the creation story to get it into the schools.
###1080 If they have a way of understanding nature
###1084 That's superior to the one that we all
###1087 Are making lots of discoveries using, great.
###1089 - bring it on. - [rings]
###1091 [norman greenbaum's "spirit in the sky" plays]
###1098 We are really, really lost.
###1100 I think it's on third.
###1103 I think it's on third. I think it's down there.
###1106 I have no idea where this place is.
###1113 I guess I just keep walking.
###1115 Do you have any idea where the discovery institute is?
###1118 Have you ever heard of that?
###1120 - never heard of it. - stein: okay, thank you.
###1122 - man: hey, ben. - how are you, sir?
###1124 - man: i'm good. Yourself? - good.
###1126 Do you have any idea where the discovery institute is?
###1129 - not a clue. - discovery institute?
###1131 - thank you, it's very kind of you to offer-- - welcome to seattle.
###1133 Thank you, sir.
###1136 It's gotta be this whole building.
###1141 Yes, where is the discovery institute, please?
###1143 Discovery institute-- on the eighth floor, suite 808.
###1145  when I die and they lay me to rest
###1147  gonna go to the place that's the best
###1150 Okay, very good.
###1152  when I lay me down to die
###1153  goin' up to the spirit in the sky
###1155 Aha, success at last.
###1158  goin' up to the spirit in the sky
###1160 Aha, we found you.
###1164 Are you bruce chapman?
###1165 - I am. - how are you? I'm ben stein.
###1167 - welcome. - kind of you to have me here.
###1168 Delighted to meet you.
###1170 Can I look around and see your offices?
###1171 Absolutely.
###1173 Do you just have this floor,
###1175 Or do you have several other floors as well?
###1177 - chapman: no, this is it. - this is it?
###1179 You've made an awful lot of trouble
###1181 For being such a small office.
###1182 I thought it was going to be like the pentagon.
###1184 We're like the little boy that said the emperor has no clothes.
###1187 And he didn't have a big organization either.
###1190 When you go around and raise funds,
###1192 Your people are not saying to them,
###1194 "by the way, we're going to get
###1196 "all these scientists out of the classroom
###1198 And put Christ back in the classroom?"
###1201 Well, I don't know that Christ
###1202 Has ever been in the science classroom.
###1204 This is not a religious argument.
###1206 This is something that people--
###1208 We have fellows who are jewish or agnostic
###1211 Or various other things.
###1212 There are--there are moslem scientists.
###1216 There are people of all kinds of backgrounds
###1218 Who agree that darwin's theory has failed.
###1220 So why would you bring religion into it?
###1222 You don't need religion. This is a red herring, ben.
###1225 People who don't have an argument
###1226 Are reduced to throwing sand in your eyes.
###1229 If the discovery institute
###1231 Could get its wish about this subject,
###1233 What would your wish be?
###1235 Well, on this subject, as on others,
###1237 We'd like people to be able to have
###1239 A robust dialogue and even a debate
###1241 Where the best evidence--
###1243 In this case the best scientific evidence--
###1246 Is made available to people.
###1248 Surely no one questions there should be a debate.
###1250 Oh, yes, they do.
###1252 - they do? - they say the debate has been settled,
###1254 - that the issue's settled. - when was the debate settled?
###1256 Ben, i'd like you to talk to the scientists.
###1258 You don't want to get your science from me.
###1260 Mr. Chapman claimed id had nothing to do with religion,
###1263 So why was my first stop biola university,
###1267 Formerly known as the bible institute of los angeles?
###1271 [johnny cash's "personal Jesus" plays]
###1275  your own personal Jesus
###1283  someone to hear your prayers
###1286  someone who cares
###1288 Nelson: string theory will be a footnote in the history of science.
###1290 The inference that stonehenge was caused by intelligence...
###1293  your own personal Jesus
###1299  someone to hear your prayers
###1301  someone who's there
###1312 Stein: how much money have you ever gotten from jerry falwell?
###1316 Uh, zero dollars.
###1318 How about pat robertson?
###1319 Zero.
###1321 Are you a minister?
###1321 No.
###1323 - are you a priest? - no.
###1324 - pastor? - no.
###1325 - youth pastor? - no.
###1327 I did teach Sunday school once.
###1328 Hasn't this all been resolved?
###1330 Aren't we all darwinists now,
###1332 Except for a few cranks like you?
###1334 Well, it's a funny thing that questions
###1337 That aren't properly answered don't go away.
###1341 This question is loaded with all kinds of political baggage,
###1345 But one-on-one at a scientific meeting
###1347 After the third or fourth beer,
###1349 My experience has been
###1351 That many evolutionary biologists
###1352 Will say, "yeah, this theory's got a lot of problems."
###1355 So you mean to tell me
###1356 That there really is a debate among scientists
###1359 About whether or not evolution occurred?
###1361 Well, "evolution" is a kind of funny word.
###1364 It depends on how one defines it.
###1366 If it means simply change over time,
###1369 Even the most rock-ribbed fundamentalist
###1372 Knows that the history of the earth has changed--
###1375 That there's been change over time.
###1377 If you define evolution precisely, though,
###1379 To mean the common descent of all life on earth
###1382 From a single ancestor
###1384 Via undirected mutation and natural selection--
###1387 That's textbook definition of neo-darwinism--
###1390 Biologists of the first rank have real questions.
###1393 But the modern theory of intelligent design
###1396 Is just microwaved creationism.
###1399 I don't think that's the case.
###1401 Creationism, properly understood,
###1403 Begins with the bible and says,
###1404 "how can I fit the bible into the data of science?"
###1409 Intelligent design doesn't do that.
###1411 Intelligent design is the study of patterns in nature
###1414 That are best explained as a result of intelligence.
###1418 So intelligent designers believe that God is the designer.
###1420 Not necessarily.
###1422 Intelligent design is a minimal commitment,
###1425 Scientifically, to the possibility
###1427 Of detecting intelligent causation.
###1429 Dr. Nelson didn't sound like a crazy person,
###1433 But I still suspected id was nothing but reheated creationism.
###1437 My next stop didn't seem like
###1439 It was going to alleviate those fears.
###1441 Male country singer:  didn't crawl out of the ocean
###1443  I didn't come from no monkey
###1446  but science tends to forget
###1448  evolution's just a theory
###1451  they present it in the textbooks
###1453  and on animal tv
###1455  like it's fact
###1456  but tell me were you there
###1458  12 million b.C.?
###1465 Evolution is a-- from an intelligent design perspective,
###1468 Is perfectly acceptable if the sense is that
###1471 "how did the design get implemented?"
###1472 The issue is, is there a real design there
###1476 And are these material mechanisms,
###1478 Like natural selection,
###1480 Are these adequate to account for everything
###1482 We see in biology?
###1484 And our argument is no, it's not.
###1486 But darwin produced all this evidence
###1488 From his travels and his studies at the galapagos
###1491 That evolution explained things.
###1492 If you look at the history of science,
###1494 People often have a good idea,
###1496 And then they decide just to run with it.
###1497 And they say, "we're going to apply this everywhere."
###1499 So darwin takes his idea of natural selection
###1501 And says, "i'm going to explain all of life with it.
###1504 Physics used to be newtonian physics.
###1507 Newton was physics.
###1508 And then you gotta look to einstein, general relativity.
###1511 It's not newton is enough.
###1512 I think, likewise, what we're finding with darwin
###1514 Is that he had some valid insights,
###1516 But it's not the whole picture.
###1518 Okay, darwinism may not be the complete picture,
###1522 But what made these guys think
###1523 They had the missing pieces?
###1525 I put this question to dr. Stephen meyer,
###1528 Author of the paper that originally got
###1530 Dr. Sternberg in so much trouble.
###1532 Stein: it's hard to believe that this little town
###1534 Is the headquarters of giant microsoft,
###1537 Which enabled mr. Gates to become fantastically rich.
###1541 Maybe that's what steve meyer's doing here.
###1543 Maybe this is somehow going to make him fantastically rich.
###1547 We'll pin him down
###1550 Like a butterfly on a butterfly board--
###1555 A butterfly on a killing board.

###1561 Stein: newton is buried in the genius's corner
###1565 At westminster abbey, right?
###1567 That's correct, yeah.
###1568 Darwin is also buried in westminster abbey.
###1571 Right. And so is darwin.
###1572 - right, right. - right near each other.
###1574 And you're here in redmond
###1576 In a little building without a sign, right?
###1578 [laughs]
###1579 And you're obviously an incredibly smart guy,
###1582 But how dare you challenge
###1583 Someone who's buried in the genius's corner
###1586 Next to newton at westminster abbey.
###1589 Well, it may seem a little cheeky,
###1591 But it's what scientists are supposed to do.
###1593 When I was in cambridge,
###1594 One of my supervisors often advised us
###1597 To beware the sound of one hand clapping,
###1601 Which was a way of saying if there's an argument on one side,
###1604 There's bound to be an argument on the other.
###1606 What I found in studying the structure
###1608 Of the argument in the origin of species
###1611 Is that for every evidence-based argument
###1613 For one of darwin's two key propositions,
###1616 There is an evidence-based counterargument.
###1618 Well, but--is it a debate?
###1619 There's just you and a couple of other guys
###1621 In a dinky little office downtown, say, on one side,
###1625 And there's the faculties of all
###1627 The great universities in the world on the other side.
###1629 Speaking with a great, uniform, and authoritative voice.
###1631 Yes, right.
###1632 Well, in any case, the debate
###1634 Really isn't going to be settled by numbers.
###1636 It's going to be settled by the evidence and the arguments.
###1639 While I was still in bill gates country,
###1641 Dr. Meyer recommended I check in
###1643 With molecular biologist jonathan wells.
###1648 What kind of names do they call you?
###1649 - uh, creationist. - what do you say back to them
###1652 When they say you're a creationist?
###1654 Well, I usually don't get the opportunity.
###1657 What's at stake for you, personally?
###1659 First of all, I love science.
###1660 I think the way darwinism
###1662 Corrupts the evidence, distorts the evidence,
###1665 Is bad for science.
###1666 Well, the other scientists will tell you
###1668 To just shut up if you love science, okay?
###1671 Because you're sort of being a bomb thrower into science.
###1675 I am upsetting the applecart.
###1676 I think it deserves to be upset in this case.
###1679 Why?
###1680 Because the evidence is being distorted
###1682 To prop up a theory that I think doesn't fit it.
###1685 Was darwinism really that bad?
###1688 Perhaps a change of scenery
###1689 Would give me a fresh perspective.
###1692 [man singing in french]
###1718 Mr. Berlinski, I assume?
###1720 - ben stein, what a pleasure to meet you. - how are you, sir?
###1722 So, where are you from originally?
###1725 I was born in new york, spent 31 years in manhattan.
###1728 - yes. - and I spent a lot of time in california, too.
###1732 And tell me all the various universities
###1734 Where you've studied or taught.
###1735 I was at princeton, then I had a professorship at stanford.
###1739 Then I left stanford, and I taught at rutgers.
###1742 I left rutgers, and I taught
###1743 At the city college in new york.
###1745 I left the city college of new york.
###1746 I taught at the baruch college, I taught at san jose--
###1749 What did you teach at baruch college?
###1750 Anything they wanted. Come on in.
###1752 Thank you, monsieur.
###1755 What an old building! Wow.
###1757 It's the oldest in paris.
###1759 You're kidding.
###1760 Merci, monsieur.
###1762 - ah, je vous en prie, monsieur. - merci.
###1766 Stein: wow, this is fabulous.
###1768 Berlinski: let's put it this way.
###1770 Before you can ask is darwinian theory correct or not,
###1774 You have to ask the preliminary question
###1776 "is it clear enough so that it could be correct?"
###1779 That's a very different question.
###1781 One of my prevailing doctrines about darwinian theory
###1784 Is, man, that thing is just a mess.
###1786 It's like looking into a room full of smoke.
###1790 Nothing in the theory
###1791 Is precisely, clearly, carefully defined or delineated.
###1795 It lacks all of the rigor
###1796 One expects from mathematical physics,
###1798 And mathematical physics lacks all the rigor
###1800 One expects from mathematics.
###1801 So we're talking about a gradual descent
###1804 Down the level of intelligibility
###1805 Until we reach evolutionary biology.
###1807 We don't even know what a species is, for heaven's sakes.
###1811 So his theory is smoke, but elegant smoke.
###1815 There's a certain elegance to it,
###1817 But I think einstein had the appropriate remark:
###1819 He preferred to leave elegance to his tailor.
###1821 A room full of smoke?
###1823 That certainly wasn't what I was hearing
###1825 From prominent darwinists like richard dawkins.
###1828 Evolution is a fact.
###1829 It's a fact which is established as securely
###1832 As essentially any other fact that we have in science.
###1835 Richard dawkins is so confident
###1837 That evolution is a fact
###1839 And that therefore God doesn't exist
###1841 That he has devoted his entire life
###1843 To spreading the evolution gospel.
###1846 I'm an atheist with respect to the judeo-Christian God
###1848 Because there is not a shred of evidence
###1851 In favor of the judeo-Christian God.
###1854 It is completely right to say
###1855 That since the evidence for evolution
###1857 Is so absolutely, totally overwhelming--
###1860 Nobody who looks at it could possibly doubt that
###1862 If they were sane and not stupid--
###1865 So the only remaining possibility is that they're ignorant,
###1868 And most people who don't believe in evolution are indeed ignorant.
###1871 But the people I spoke with weren't ignorant.
###1874 They were highly credentialed scientists.
###1877 So there had to be something else going on here.
###1880 So you think the whole theory of evolution is false
###1884 Or just certain parts of it?
###1886 Well, again, "evolution" is a slippery word.
###1889 I would say minor changes within species happen.
###1892 But darwin didn't write a book called
###1894 How existing species change over time.
###1898 He wrote a book called the origin of species.
###1901 - he purported to show how this same process-- - huh, I see.
###1905 ...Leads to new species-- in fact, every species--
###1909 And the evidence for that grand claim
###1911 Is, in my opinion, almost totally lacking.
###1913 How does darwin-- or darwinism--say life began?
###1918 Well, he didn't know. And, in fact, nobody knows.
###1921 So darwinism, strictly defined,
###1924 Starts after the origin of life
###1926 And deals only with living things.
###1928 How can there be a theory about life
###1931 Without a theory about how life began?
###1934 Well, a grand, overarching evolutionary story,
###1938 Of course, does include the origin of life.
###1941 Darwin's theory doesn't begin
###1942 Until you have the first cell.
###1944 Does someone have a theory about how life began?
###1947 [explosion]
###1954 Man: this is the story of a small planet in space
###1957 Called earth.
###1959 Stein: for a typical darwinian explanation
###1961 Of how life originated,
###1962 Dr. Wells directed me toward this documentary.
###1966 Man: the chemical elements essential for life--
###1969 Hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen--
###1972 Were now in place.
###1974 What was needed was a way of combining them.
###1979 Perhaps the energy came from lightning.
###1983 - whatever it was-- - [film pauses]
###1985 Stein: excuse me?
###1987 - [film resumes] - man: whatever it was,
###1989 Energy managed to arrange these chemical ingredients
###1991 In just the right way.
###1993 Stein: "whatever it was"?
###1995 I was hoping for something a little more scientific.
###1998 The most popular idea
###2001 Has been that life emerged spontaneously
###2003 From primordial soup.
###2005 In 1953, stanley miller
###2007 Mixed water, methane, ammonia, and hydrogen
###2011 To simulate the early earth's atmosphere.
###2013 Then he ran electricity through it
###2015 In an attempt to jump-start life.
###2018 It's alive! It's alive!
###2019 It's alive!
###2021 It didn't work.
###2023 While the initial results seemed promising,
###2026 50 years later most serious scientists
###2028 Have abandoned this approach
###2030 In favor of alternate theories.
###2032 Prominent darwinist michael ruse
###2034 Attempted to explain one of them to me.
###2036 He wasn't kidding.
###2038 How did we get from an inorganic world
###2041 To the world of the cell?
###2044 Well, one popular theory is that it
###2046 Might have started off on the backs of crystals.
###2050 My crystal ball.
###2052 Molecules piggybacked on the back of crystals forming,
###2056 And that this led to more and more complex--
###2059 But of course the nice thing about crystals
###2060 Is that every now and then you get mistakes--mutations--
###2064 And that this opens the way for natural selection.
###2067 But--but at one point there was not a living thing,
###2070 And then there was a living thing.
###2072 How did that happen?
###2073 Well, that's just a-- i've just told you.
###2075 I don't see any reason why you shouldn't go
###2077 From very simple to more and more complex to more and more complex--
###2081 I don't either.
###2082 But I don't know how you get from mud
###2084 To a living cell. That's my question.
###2086 Yes, well, i've told you. I'll try one more time.
###2088 You think it was on the backs of crystals.
###2090 On the backs of crystals is at least one hypothesis, yes.
###2094 So that's your theory, and you think that is more likely
###2096 And less far-fetched than intelligent design.
###2098 I think it is.
###2100 I wouldn't put ben stein's money
###2102 On dr. Ruse's joyriding crystals,
###2104 But it did make me wonder
###2106 What were the chances of life arising on its own?
###2109 Bradley: it's been speculated that probably
###2111 There would have to be
###2112 A minimum of about 250 proteins
###2115 To provide minimal life function.
###2117 Um, if that's really true,
###2121 Then I think it's almost inconceivable
###2123 That life could've happened
###2125 In some simple, step-by-step way.
###2127 Okay, so the simplest form of life
###2130 Requires at least 250 proteins to function.
###2133 What's so difficult about that?
###2136 [1950s school filmstrip music plays]
###2138 Filmstrip narrator: welcome to the casino of life.
###2141 Who wants to spin for a chance to win?
###2144 Oh, sure. I'll give it a shot.
###2147 What do I win?
###2149 Take a look at this.
###2150 - [man in audience wolf-whistles] - huh?
###2153 How 'bout the world's first single-cell organism?
###2155 This perfectly aligned string of proteins
###2158 Could be yours.
###2159 Now, take a spin.
###2166 - [bell rings] - I won!
###2168 [laughs]
###2169 Tina, tell him how many times
###2171 He needs to do that to win the prize.
###2174 Two hundred and fifty.
###2176 - [audience boos] - show host: that's right, folks.
###2177 And all in the correct order.
###2180 But that's impossible.
###2182 [laughs] we've heard that before,
###2184 Haven't we, richard?
###2187 [like dawkins] come on, mother nature, do your thing.
###2189 [machine buzzes]
###2191 You stupid machine! I hate you.
###2200 We're talking about something that's staggeringly improbable,
###2203 Roughly one in a trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion.
###2207 Let all of life chose a million, a trillion,
###2210 A trillion trillion--
###2211 The number is essentially zero.
###2212 Something has to skew nature to chose the ones that work.
###2216 So, in the game of life,
###2219 It looks as if the house always wins.
###2221 Luckily, some serious scientific minds
###2224 Have figured out a way to beat the odds.
###2227 [man reads in ominous voice]
###2231 Stein: when faced with the overwhelming problem
###2233 Of the origin of life,
###2234 Nobel prize-winner francis crick
###2236 Proposed this theory--
###2238 That life was "seeded" on earth,
###2240 Which basically means aliens did it.
###2246 Crystals? Aliens?
###2250 I thought we were talking about science,
###2252 Not science fiction.
###2255 We don't know what caused life to arise.
###2258 Did it arise by a purely undirected process,
###2260 Or did it arise by some kind
###2262 Of intelligent guidance or design?
###2264 And the rules of science
###2266 Are being applied to actually foreclose
###2268 One of the two possible answers
###2270 To that very fundamental and basic and important question.
###2273 So the rules of science say
###2275 We will consider any possibility
###2277 - except one that is guided. - exactly.
###2279 No matter how life began,
###2281 On the backs of crystals
###2283 Or in the test tube of some intelligent designer,
###2286 Everyone agrees it started with a single cell.
###2289 But what is a cell?
###2290 - let me ask you a question. - yeah.
###2292 Darwin wrote the origin of species in 1859--
###2296 Published it in 1859.
###2298 He had an idea of the cell as being quite simple, correct?
###2302 Yeah, everybody did.
###2303 Okay, if he thought of the cell as being a buick,
###2308 What is the cell now
###2310 In terms of its complexity by comparison?
###2312 A galaxy.
###2313 If darwin thought a cell
###2316 Was, say, a mud hut,
###2318 What do we now know that a cell is?
###2321 More complicated than a saturn v.
###2325 So what is in a cell as far as we know now?
###2328 A world that darwin never could've imagined.
###2331 I needed someone who could
###2332 Give me a glimpse into this world,
###2334 So we went to molecular biologist doug axe.
###2338 Axe: think of a cell as being a nanofactory,
###2341 A factory where, on a very small scale,
###2345 Digital instructions are being used
###2347 To make the components of the factory.
###2350 Here we have the famous dna double helix.
###2352 You can see the two helical strands
###2354 That are intertwined and wind around each other
###2357 On the outside of the molecule.
###2359 This is the material that stores
###2361 All of our genetic information.
###2364 In higher life forms, this would be the equivalent
###2367 Of something like a gigabyte of information
###2369 Stored in the molecules
###2371 That form the individual chromosomes,
###2373 All packed within the nucleus,
###2375 Which is a tiny fraction of the entire cell size.
###2379 So what does dna do?
###2380 Well, the information in dna
###2382 Ends up providing the information
###2384 For sequencing the amino acids to make protein.
###2388 We have information in a one-dimensional form
###2391 That provides the information for a three-dimensional form.
###2409 [whooshes]
###2414 [liquid gurgling]
###2449 [fluttering]
###2465 I'm finally just beginning to grasp
###2468 The complexity of the cell.
###2469 Are there systems within the cell
###2471 That go well beyond darwinian evolution,
###2474 Some type of cellular technology
###2476 That drives adaptation, replication,
###2479 Quality control, and repair?
###2481 What if these new mechanisms
###2483 Have massive design implications?
###2485 Well, I say so be it.
###2488 The cell really is like nothing we've ever seen in the physical world.
###2492 That's got to be firmly grasped.
###2493 That's not something we can just say,
###2495 "oh, well, it's just a little bit more of the same old, same old.
###2499 It's not the same old, same old.
###2500 What we are finding is that there's information
###2502 That's in the cell that cannot be accounted for
###2505 In terms of these undirected material causes,
###2508 And so there's some other--
###2510 So there has to be an information source.
###2513 So one of the key questions faced by modern biology
###2517 Is where do you get information from?
###2522 Well, darwin assumed
###2525 That the increase in information
###2527 Comes from natural selection.
###2531 But natural selection reduces genetic information,
###2535 And we know this from all the genetic manipulation studies that we have.
###2538 Where is the new genetic information gonna come from?
###2541 Well, that's the big question.
###2543 So when we find information in the dna molecule,
###2546 The most likely explanation
###2548 Is that it, too, had an intelligent source.
###2550 We need engineering principles
###2552 To understand these systems, okay?
###2554 It's only because of our advancements in nanotechnology
###2557 That we can even begin to appreciate these systems.
###2560 But using intelligent design
###2562 Didn't seem to stop the scientists I spoke with.
###2565 So why all the controversy?
###2567 Suppose we find, simply as a matter of fact,
###2571 That our scientific inquiries point in one direction.
###2574 Which is that there is an intelligent creator.
###2575 Why should we eliminate that from discussion?
###2578 Streng verboten? How come? Why?
###2580 Streng verboten. Very good.
###2582 What does streng verboten mean, "strongly forbidden"?
###2584 Strongly forbidden.
###2586 You've got two possible hypotheses.
###2587 You've got a wall through the middle--
###2589 Through your brain, in effect-- through your thinking.
###2592 You say, well, you can't consider anything on this side of the wall.
###2595 Only hypotheses on this side of the wall
###2597 Are permissible for consideration.
###2600 What about academic freedom?
###2602 I mean, can't we just talk about this?
###2605 Their reply is that science is not a democratic process.
###2609 Oh, really?
###2610 And that there is a consensus view
###2612 And that we are to subscribe to the consensual view.
###2614 Wait a second. Darwin challenged the consensus view,
###2617 And that's how we got darwinism.
###2619 If darwin wanted to challenge the consensus today,
###2622 How would he do it?
###2624 Science isn't a hobby for rich aristocrats anymore.
###2627 It's a multibillion-dollar industry.
###2629 And if you want a piece of the pie,
###2632 You've got to be a "good comrade."
###2638 Man: scientific ideas--
###2640 How we get them to you, the people.
###2643 Every idea must be inspected to ensure that it is safe.
###2648 All theories must pass through a series of checkpoints.
###2651 First--the academy.
###2653 Stein: getting a controversial theory
###2655 Through the academy can be dangerous.
###2658 Few people know this better than congressman mark souder.
###2661 He uncovered a targeted campaign
###2664 Led by individuals within the smithsonian
###2667 And the national center for science education
###2670 To destroy dr. Sternberg's credibility.
###2673 If you want peer reviews, if you want to be published,
###2676 If you want to go to respected institutions,
###2679 The core view does not tolerate dissent.
###2683 There's kind of a "this is the way it is,"
###2685 And anybody who's a dissenter should be squashed.
###2688 Are you going to be on my side if I let you up?
###2690 Sure, chick, sure. I'm on your side.
###2693 Just let me up. I'll do anything you say.
###2695 Souder isn't the only one who has witnessed the academy's tactics.
###2699 Journalist larry witham
###2700 Has seen similar behavior during his 25 years
###2703 Of covering the evolution controversy.
###2706 Once you're thick in science,
###2707 You can't question the paradigm.
###2710 But if you want to get grants,
###2711 If you want to be elected to high positions,
###2714 If you want to get awards as a promoter
###2717 Of public education of science,
###2718 You can't question the paradigm.
###2720 People cannot be trusted to form their own opinions.
###2724 This business about open-mindedness is nonsense.
###2728 Why is the scientific establishment
###2731 So afraid of free speech?
###2733 There is this fear
###2736 That if one aspect of a theory
###2739 Is closely scrutinized,
###2741 There's going to be an unraveling.
###2743 Who are you?
###2744 Oh, uh--
###2745 I am the great and powerful...
###2747 [weakly] ...Wizard of oz.
###2749 I interviewed dozens and dozens of scientists,
###2752 And when they're amongst each other
###2754 Or talking to a journalist who they trust,
###2757 They'll speak about,
###2759 Um, you know, "it's incredibly complex,"
###2762 Or "molecular biology's in a crisis."
###2764 But publicly they can't say that.
###2770 Man: keeping a keen eye on the academy
###2772 Are various watchdog organizations.
###2774 Stein: listen to eugenie scott
###2776 Of the national center for science education.
###2779 The ncse has been at the heart
###2782 Of virtually every evolution controversy
###2784 Over the past 25 years,
###2786 Vigorously defending the darwinian gospel.
###2789 Scott: we have had a lot of business,
###2791 Unfortunately, at ncse in the last few years
###2794 Because virtually every state
###2796 In which science education standards
###2798 Has come up for consideration
###2800 Has had a big fight
###2802 About the coverage of evolution in them.
###2805 Scott: ncse was started by a group
###2806 Of scientists and teachers
###2808 Who were very concerned
###2809 Because in the late '70s and early '80s
###2812 There were a lot of attempts to pass
###2813 "equal time for creation science and evolution" laws.
###2816 Clearly, this is something that neither scientists nor teachers liked.
###2819 It wasn't exactly "help, help, the creationists are coming,"
###2822 But, you know, kind of along those lines.
###2824 Most scientists just throw up their hands and say,
###2827 "creationists! They drive me crazy. You handle it."
###2830 We've worked a lot with science education organizations.
###2833 The most important group we work with
###2835 Is members of the faith community,
###2837 Because the best-kept secret in this controversy
###2840 Is that catholics and mainstream protestants
###2842 Are okay on evolution.
###2844 Are you sure about that, eugenie?
###2847 Liberal Christians have been fighting with
###2850 Conservative Christians for so long
###2853 That they'll side with anybody against the fundamentalists.
###2857 And eugenie scott says, "well, welcome over."
###2860 There's a kind of science defense lobby
###2862 Or an evolution defense lobby, in particular.
###2865 They are mostly atheists,
###2867 But they are wanting to-- desperately wanting
###2870 To be friendly to mainstream, sensible, religious people.
###2876 And the way you do that is to tell them
###2878 That there's no incompatibility between science and religion.
###2883 But is there really an incompatibility?
###2886 Can't we believe in God and darwin?
###2890 Implicit in most evolutionary theory
###2892 Is that either there's no God,
###2894 Or God can't have any role in it.
###2896 So, naturally, as many evolutionists will say,
###2900 It's the strongest engine for atheism.
###2902 If they called me as a witness,
###2904 And a lawyer said,
###2907 "dr. Dawkins, has your belief in evolution--
###2911 Has your study of evolution turned you towards atheism?"
###2914 I would have to say yes.
###2915 And that's the worst possible thing I could say
###2918 For winning that-- that court case.
###2921 So people like me are bad news
###2922 For the science lobby, the evolution lobby.
###2926 By the way, i'm being a hell of a lot
###2927 More frank and honest in this interview
###2930 Than many people in this field would be.
###2935 Man: working hard to keep ideas in check
###2937 Are our friends in the media.
###2939 Morning paper! Paper, mister?
###2942 The tendency of the media is to side with the establishment
###2945 Because they inherently agree with the establishment.
###2948 Abrams: eugenie scott, my understanding is
###2950 That there is not a single peer-reviewed article out there
###2953 That supports intelligent design. Am I wrong?
###2957 You are not wrong. You are correct.
###2960 I believe that we get coverage,
###2962 But we always get coverage like we're the outsider,
###2965 Not like it's an even debate.
###2967 Filmstrip narrator: but instead of merely reporting news,
###2970 He analyzes it, often expressing his personal opinions.
###2973 We constantly deal with reporters
###2975 Who refuse even to report
###2978 The correct definition of intelligent design.
###2981 They, over and over again, talk about
###2984 "life is so complex, God must've done it."
###2986 - meyer: let me explain-- - abrams: admit it, it's religion.
###2989 - it's very simple. - you can't--it's religion.
###2990 It's a wanton distortion of our position.
###2992 [phone rings]
###2994 City desk.
###2995 I've got a hot story here.
###2997 You can look at associated press stories,
###3000 And the same sentence will appear in those stories for 10 years:
###3003 "intelligent design says that life is too complex."
###3006 It's called a boilerplate.
###3009 And the reporter never reports any more
###3011 Or gets any new ways to say it,
###3013 So the public understanding never advances.
###3016 But what happens if a reporter
###3018 Decides to take a more balanced approach to intelligent design?
###3022 There might be remarkable pressure on that reporter
###3025 Not to side against the evolutionists.
###3028 I thought I told you to kill that story.
###3030 Few reporters have learned this better
###3033 Than author and journalist pamela winnick.
###3035 When she refused to take sides
###3038 In an article she wrote about intelligent design,
###3041 The darwinists found a new favorite target.
###3043 Number one-- I wasn't Christian, I was jewish.
###3046 Number two-- I wasn't religious.
###3047 Number three-- I was not taking
###3049 A position in favor of creationism.
###3051 I was writing about intelligent design.
###3054 And it didn't matter.
###3056 After I wrote that one piece,
###3057 Everything I wrote on the subject was scrutinized.
###3060 There were hate letters coming into the newspaper.
###3064 If you give any credence to it whatsoever,
###3066 Which means just writing about it,
###3068 You are just finished as a journalist.
###3072 Other journalists we spoke with
###3073 Told similar stories but didn't dare appear on camera.
###3077 Filmstrip narrator: and now the presses are ready to roll.
###3083 Man: when all other checkpoints fail,
###3085 There's always the courts.
###3093 We have spent an enormous amount of time
###3096 Trying to prove to the court
###3099 What everybody already knows,
###3101 That intelligent design
###3102 Is a particular religious belief.
###3105 But I thought scientific questions
###3107 Were settled by the evidence,
###3108 Not by taking people to court and suing them.
###3112 How do other countries deal with such disputes?
###3115 Dr. Marciej giertych, a population geneticist
###3118 Who now represents poland in the european parliament,
###3121 Was able to shed some light on this topic.
###3124 Giertych: the censorship of
###3125 Teaching criticism of evolution
###3128 Is and always was much stronger in,
###3132 Say, your country, the United States,
###3134 Than it ever was in poland.
###3136 Why? Why would the censorship--
###3138 That is because you have a political correctness in your country.
###3141 These issues are brought to court,
###3143 And the court says
###3145 What you can and what you cannot teach.
###3147 We want to know what you teach,
###3149 What books you use, how you teach it.
###3153 We never had that sort of way
###3154 Of deciding scientific issues in poland.
###3157 We never had the courts involved.
###3159 So you are saying that
###3160 As far as the teaching of science is concerned,
###3163 Poland is freer academically than the United States?
###3167 I think--in this particular issue
###3169 Of evolution, I think this is true.
###3171 But how effective are the courts
###3173 In deciding such matters?
###3175 What about the general idea that intelligent design
###3179 Is doomed as a result of several recent legal setbacks?
###3182 I think court cases don't decide anything.
###3185 If you look at the scopes trial, who won that trial?
###3188 It wasn't the evolutionists. It was the--
###3190 The tennessee law was upheld, barring evolution,
###3193 And yet in the popular imagination,
###3195 Scopes is the hero.
###3197 Inherit the wind-- that movie--
###3199 Which is really bogus history based on the scopes trial,
###3202 Has carried the day.
###3203 These issues go much deeper than any decision by a judge.
###3207 The evolution debate
###3209 Does seem to run much deeper than the courts,
###3211 Much deeper even than science.
###3213 To generate this level of hostility,
###3216 Id must threaten something at the very core
###3219 Of the darwinian establishment.
###3223 Filmstrip narrator: the entire globe
###3225 Is today the site of a momentous conflict.
###3228 It is the challenge of ideas.
###3236 I'm edward r. Murrow.
###3237 For a little while,
###3238 I would like to review with you
###3240 The great conflict of our times,
###3242 One which demands and must get
###3244 The attention and the involvement
###3246 Of each one of us.
###3248 This conflict
###3250 Over the principles of evolution
###3254 Has become a religious war.
###3257 It really is no longer about scientific investigation.
###3262 It is total competition with an antagonist
###3265 Who is putting into it
###3266 Everything within his capability.
###3268 The situation has reached a point
###3271 Where many of evolution's top apologists
###3274 Have switched from defending darwinism
###3276 To attacking religion, in what they see as a bid
###3279 To stamp out intelligent design at the source.
###3282 Richard dawkins is the best example of this.
###3285 His recent book, the God delusion,
###3287 Has sold over one million copies worldwide.
###3290 The God delusion
###3291 Is my long-expected, long-worked-on,
###3297 Full-frontal attack on religion.
###3299 To me, science is about trying to explain existence,
###3303 And religion is about trying to explain existence.
###3306 It's just that religion gets the wrong answer.
###3309 But is dawkins correct?
###3310 Are science and religion really at war?
###3314 For an appraisal of this continuing and protracted conflict,
###3318 We can go to a reporter
###3319 Who has watched the growing conflict
###3321 With the perception of a trained military observer.
###3324 Oxford professor alister mcgrath,
###3327 Author of the dawkins delusion,
###3329 Seemed like the ideal person to answer my question.
###3332 Mcgrath: richard dawkins has a charming
###3334 And very, I think, interesting view
###3337 Of the relationship between science and religion.
###3339 They're at war with each other,
###3340 And in the end, one's got to win.
###3343 And it's going to be science.
###3345 It's a very naive view.
###3346 It's based on a complete historical misrepresentation
###3350 Of the way science and religion have interacted.
###3352 Dawkins seems to think that scientific description
###3356 Is an anti-religious argument.
###3358 Describing how something happens scientifically
###3361 Somehow explains it away.
###3363 It doesn't.
###3364 But the questions of purpose, intentionality,
###3367 The question why,
###3369 Still remain there on the table.
###3371 I think it was just a catastrophic mistake
###3373 To have someone like dawkins address himself
###3376 To profound issues of theology,
###3378 The existence of God, the nature of life.
###3379 He hasn't committed himself to
###3381 Disciplined study in any relevant area of inquiry.
###3383 He's a crummy philosopher.
###3385 He doesn't have the rudimentary skills
###3387 To meticulously assess his own arguments.
###3391 Genius guy, though.
###3392 Very smart guy.
###3393 Little bit of a reptile, but very smart guy.
###3396 The opposing point of view in this conflict
###3398 Rests on a fundamentally different vision of man.
###3401 If you have two distinguished scientists--
###3403 And, in fact, you can range many more on each side, as you know--
###3407 Saying exactly opposite things,
###3410 That's telling me that the conflict
###3412 Is not between science and belief in God.
###3415 Otherwise you'd expect all scientists to be atheists.
###3418 But it's a worldview conflict.
###3420 It's between scientists who have different worldviews.
###3422 You've got two competing explanations of the evidence.
###3425 One says design, one says undirected processes.
###3427 Both of them have larger philosophical or religious
###3430 Or anti-religious implications.
###3432 So you can't say that one of those two theories is scientific
###3435 And the other is unscientific
###3437 Simply because they have implications.
###3439 Both have implications.
###3440 People who tell you,
###3441 For example, that science tells you
###3443 All you need to know about the world
###3444 Or that science tells you that religion is all wrong
###3446 Or science tells you there is no God,
###3448 Those people aren't telling you scientific things.
###3450 They are saying metaphysical things,
###3452 And they have to defend their positions
###3454 For metaphysical reasons.
###3456 What is being presented to the public is
###3459 First comes the science,
###3461 And then comes the worldview.
###3464 I would want to argue that that may not be the case,
###3467 That it may actually be the other way 'round,
###3469 That the worldview comes first
###3472 And is influencing the interpretation of science.
###3475 My deep regret is some people
###3477 Are so deeply entrenched in their own worldviews
###3481 That they will simply not countenance alternatives.
###3486 I'm actually a person of the left,
###3489 And not even a particularly religious person.
###3490 I think of myself as kind of humanist.
###3492 And I think it's sending a very bad message
###3495 To religious people who are interested in science
###3498 That in some sense,
###3499 In order to do science credibly,
###3500 They have to leave their religious beliefs at the door.
###3503 The founders of early modern science--
###3505 Sir isaac newton, robert boyle,
###3506 Johannes kepler, galileo--
###3508 Most of these early scientists
###3511 All not only believed in God,
###3513 But they thought their belief in God
###3514 Actually made it easier to do science.
###3517 You can be religiously motivated
###3518 And you can do good science,
###3520 And they have more often gone together
###3522 Than not gone together.
###3523 Admitting our biases
###3525 Is the best way towards rational discussion,
###3528 Which I would welcome.
###3530 Rational debate is a nice thought,
###3533 But it's nearly impossible in the current climate.
###3536 I'd seen the chilling effect
###3537 That this unquestioning devotion to darwinism
###3540 Has had on science...
###3543 But were there other consequences?
###3548 No Gods, no life after death,
###3551 No ultimate foundation for ethics,
###3553 No ultimate meaning in life,
###3556 And no human free will
###3560 Are all deeply connected to an evolutionary perspective.
###3565 You're here today and then gone tomorrow,
###3567 And that's all there is to it.
###3569 Stein: dr. Will provine,
###3571 Professor of the history of biology
###3573 At cornell university,
###3575 Gave us another disturbing glimpse
###3578 Into where darwinism can lead.
###3580 Oh, I was a Christian,
###3581 But I never heard anything about evolution
###3584 Because it was illegal to teach it in tennessee.
###3589 Dr. Provine's first biology professor changed all that.
###3593 He started talking about evolution
###3596 As if it had no design in it whatsoever.
###3598 And I came up to him, and I said,
###3600 "you left out the most important part."
###3602 And he said, "if you feel the same way at the end of one quarter,
###3606 "I want you to stand up in front of the students in this class
###3609 And tell them this deep lack in evolution."
###3612 And I read that book so carefully,
###3615 And I could find no sign of there being
###3619 Any design whatsoever in evolution.
###3623 And I immediately began to doubt
###3626 The existence of the deity.
###3630 But it starts by giving up an active deity.
###3633 Then he gives up the hope
###3635 That there's any life after death.
###3637 When you give those two up,
###3639 The rest of it follows fairly easily.
###3641 You give up the hope
###3643 That there's an eminent morality.
###3645 And finally, there's no human free will.
###3649 If you believe in evolution,
###3651 You can't hope for there being any free will.
###3655 There's no hope whatsoever
###3658 Of there being any deep meaning in human life.
###3661 We live, we die, and we're gone.
###3664 We're absolutely gone when we die.
###3667 Dr. Provine is no stranger to the prospect of death.
###3671 Nearly a decade ago,
###3672 He was diagnosed with a large brain tumor.
###3675 Let's suppose my tumor comes back,
###3677 As it almost certainly will.
###3679 Well, i'm not going to sit around
###3682 Like my older brother did last year.
###3685 And he was dying of als, lou gehrig's disease.
###3688 He wanted desperately to die, but we couldn't help him die.
###3693 I don't want to die like that.
###3695 I'm going to shoot myself in the head long before then.
###3698 I'm going to do something different.
###3701 I hope these are empty words
###3703 From my friend dr. Provine,
###3705 Because shortly after this interview was recorded
###3707 He learned his brain tumor had returned.
###3710 Provine: I don't feel one bit bad
###3712 About holding the views that I do.
###3714 There's not anything in the views I hold
###3716 That makes me, "oh, I wish I had free will,"
###3719 Or "oh, I wish there were a God."
###3722 I don't ever, ever wish for that.
###3725 Dr. Provine's de-conversion story
###3727 Was typical amongst the darwinists we interviewed.
###3730 Biologist p.Z. Myers,
###3732 Who runs the pro-darwin, anti-religion blog pharyngula,
###3737 Says science eroded his faith as well.
###3740 I never hated religion.
###3741 I found religion quite comfortable,
###3743 And I liked the people in it.
###3746 What led to the atheism was learning more about science,
###3749 Learning more about the natural world,
###3751 And seeing these horrible conflicts with religion.
###3754 And it was then, when I discovered evolution,
###3757 When I discovered darwinism,
###3759 That I realized there's this magnificently elegant,
###3761 Stunningly elegant explanation--
###3764 Which I didn't quite understand to begin with--
###3766 But when I did understand it,
###3768 Then that finally killed off my remaining religious faith.
###3772 After hearing these stories,
###3773 I was not surprised to discover
###3775 That most evolutionary biologists
###3778 Share professor dawkins' views.
###3780 It appears darwinism does lead to atheism
###3783 Despite what eugenie scott would have us believe.
###3786 And if you separate out the ethical message from religion,
###3792 What have you got left?
###3794 You've got a bunch of fairy tales, right?
###3797 I think that God is about as unlikely
###3801 As fairies, angels, hobgoblins, etc.
###3806 Religion--I mean, it's just fantasy, basically.
###3810 It's completely empty of any explanatory content...
###3815 And is evil as well. [chuckles]
###3818 Half the people in this country think that drugs
###3821 Is what you have to regulate to make us safer,
###3823 And half the people think guns--
###3824 That's what you gotta regulate to make us safer.
###3826 But I always think that if you're going to regulate
###3829 One thing that has the most potential
###3831 To cause death and destruction-- religion.
###3834 You gotta start with religion.
###3836 [audience applauds]
###3838 Religion is an idea that gives some people comfort,
###3842 And we don't want to take it away from them.
###3845 It's like knitting. People like to knit.
###3847 We're not going to take their knitting needles away.
###3850 We're not going to take away their churches.
###3852 But what we have to do is get it to a place
###3854 Where religion is treated
###3857 At the level it should be treated.
###3858 That is, something fun
###3861 That people get together and do on the weekend
###3863 And really doesn't affect their life
###3867 As much as it has been so far.
###3868 Stein: so what would the world look like
###3871 If dr. Meyers got his wish?
###3873 Greater science literacy,
###3874 Which is going to lead to the erosion of religion,
###3876 And then we'll get this nice positive feedback mechanism going,
###3879 Where as religion slowly fades away,
###3880 We get more and more science to replace it.
###3882 And that will displace more and more religion,
###3884 Which will allow more and more science in,
###3886 And we'll eventually get to that point
###3888 Where religion has taken that appropriate place
###3892 As a side dish rather than the main course.
###3896 Stein: but will eradicating religion
###3898 Really lead to a modern utopia?
###3902 Hmm.
###3905 Let me try to imagine that.
###3907 And let's let history be our guide.
###3915 Berlinski: in part, I think matthew arnold
###3917 Put his hands on it when he spoke about
###3920 Um, the withdrawal of faith.
###3922 There is a connection between a society
###3925 That has at least a minimal commitment
###3927 To certain kinds of transcendental values
###3930 And what human beings permit themselves
###3932 To do one to the other.
###3935 That got me thinking.
###3936 What other societies have used darwinism
###3939 To trump all other authorities,
###3941 Including religion?
###3942 As a jew,
###3944 My mind leapt to one regime in particular.
###3947 The connection between hitler and darwin
###3949 Is of course historically a difficult connection
###3952 Because they were separated by a good many years.
###3954 One was english, one was german.
###3956 Nonetheless, if you open mein kampf and read it--
###3959 Especially if you can read it in german--
###3962 The correspondence between darwinian ideas
###3965 And nazi ideas just leaps from the page.
###3968 Of course you have to add every historical caution.
###3970 Not everyone who read darwin became a nazi, obviously not.
###3974 No one is making that case.
###3975 Darwinism is not a sufficient condition
###3979 For a phenomenon like nazism,
###3981 But I think it's certainly a necessary one.
###3984 This was a connection I had to explore personally.
###3992 [church bells tolling]
###4003 Filmstrip narrator: american officers arrive at a nazi institution
###4006 Seized by first army troops.
###4007 Under the guise of an insane asylum,
###4009 This has been the headquarters
###4010 For the systematic murder...
###4012 [filmstrip audio fades]
###4017 Stein: so, what is this place?
###4018 During the second world war,
###4020 15,000 people were killed here.
###4023 Why were they killed?
###4025 They were killed because they were people with handicaps.
###4028 Why kill them? What's the point of killing them?
###4030 People who were not able to work,
###4032 People who were not able to live by themselves,
###4035 That they were "useless eaters."
###4037 "useless eaters."
###4039 And "life unworthy of living."
###4042 George: this idea grew up in the '20s,
###4044 So long before national socialism,
###4046 Biologists, anthropologists,
###4048 They thought that maybe mankind could--
###4052 Or the government could interfere
###4056 - into the growth of the population. - stein: I see.
###4058 And they had the... Utopia?
###4060 - utopia. - utopia...
###4061 That they would have a society
###4063 Without illness and without handicap.
###4066 [man speaking german]
###4091 So this was a darwinian concept.
###4093 - yes. - and also a malthusian concept,
###4095 Very much malthusian.
###4097 - malthusian? - thomas malthus, who said
###4099 That there was a shortage of resources.
###4102 English philosopher, said there was a shortage--
###4104 Yes, but the nazis, they relied on darwin.
###4107 - they relied on darwin. - yes, darwin and german scientists.
###4112 Patients were led down this hallway
###4115 To nazi doctors,
###4116 Who decided who would live and who would die.
###4120 They were accompanied by 15, um, 15 nurses.
###4126 - nurses. - nurses.
###4127 Male and female nurses.
###4129 So nurses were helping lead them to their doom.
###4132 Yes.
###4153 So, were the prisoners told they were taking a shower?
###4155 Yes, they were taking a shower,
###4157 And here was one or two showers.
###4158 So, how many people were brought into this room?
###4162 Sixty to seventy.
###4173 So, what is this?
###4174 This is the dissection table.
###4176 Do you ever think to yourself
###4178 The sane ones were the ones
###4180 Lying here having their brains removed--
###4182 The insane one was dr. Gorgass and all the other people--?
###4185 No, no, I don't think that
###4187 Because I think those people who killed here,
###4190 They were very sane because they had their purposes.
###4194 They had purposes?
###4195 Yes. I don't think they were insane.
###4207 - they had two crematory ovens. - I see.
###4209 And they killed about 70 people.
###4212 - a day. - a day, so they had--
###4214 That's barely enough time. They had their work--
###4217 They only killed from Monday to Friday, so...
###4221 Because the people who were doing the killing
###4223 Needed to have the weekend off.
###4224 If you met dr. Gorgass today, what would you say to him?
###4229 I don't know.
###4231 I don't think that it's my--my role
###4234 To--to tell him something.
###4238 It's difficult to describe
###4240 How it felt to walk through such a haunting place,
###4243 To know that these cold stone and tile walls
###4247 Were the last things the victims of hadamar ever saw.
###4253 I wanted to explore this connection further,
###4256 So I met with the author of from darwin to hitler,
###4259 Dr. Richard weikart.
###4262 Hitler and many of the physicians
###4265 That carried out this program
###4266 Were very fanatical darwinists
###4268 And particularly wanted to apply darwinism to society.
###4271 [hitler speaking german]
###4293 Many of these people in the 19-teens, 1920s
###4296 Who were putting forward some of these ideas about racism
###4299 Were considered the leading scientists.
###4302 These were darwinists who were taken seriously by fellow academics.
###4306 It's not to say that all academics believed it.
###4308 These leading academics, were there any of them who were americans?
###4312 There were plenty of americans
###4313 Who were saying similar kinds of things.
###4316 Not only were americans saying such things,
###4319 They were pioneers in this fledging science
###4322 Known as eugenics.
###4324 They thought they could help evolution along
###4327 By sterilizing the so-called feeble-minded
###4330 And prohibiting them from getting married.
###4334 Physicians who are aware of the history
###4337 Of 20th-century american medicine
###4339 Harbor some bad feelings towards darwinists
###4343 Because of eugenics.
###4344 And eugenics--
###4346 Which was an attempt to breed human beings--
###4349 It was the darkest chapter of american medicine ever.
###4352 There were 50,000 people involuntarily sterilized
###4355 Because they were deemed unfit to breed, basically.
###4362 Stein: eugenics isn't just history.
###4364 The spirit of the movement lives on today.
###4369 Weikart: margaret sanger
###4371 Was the head of planned parenthood.
###4372 She was very fanatical in her promotion of eugenics.
###4375 In fact, planned parenthood was all about birth control
###4378 For the impoverished and lower classes
###4381 To try to help improve the species.
###4388 From hadamar,
###4390 I traveled with dr. Weikart to dachau,
###4393 Where the nazis applied the ideas of eugenics
###4396 On a massive mechanistic scale.
###4401 When it was a fully functioning concentration camp,
###4404 Uh, what was the purpose of it?
###4407 I mean, part of it was to repress political enemies.
###4410 What was the rest of the purpose?
###4412 Well, beyond the repression of the political enemies,
###4414 Which was its purpose at the very beginning,
###4416 Then later on it transformed into repressing racial enemies.
###4420 And sometimes those categories overlapped
###4422 Because sometimes they thought
###4424 That these people were political enemies
###4426 Because they were inferior biologically.
###4428 The war itself was part of
###4430 The darwinian struggle for existence, for hitler.
###4432 And he saw that extermination of the jews
###4435 As one of those fronts to this warfare going on,
###4439 As this darwinian struggle for existence.
###4442 Would you say that hitler was insane?
###4444 No, I wouldn't say he was insane.
###4446 I think he had imbibed some very, very wrong ideas,
###4451 And, in fact, I think
###4453 He took the logic of them in certain ways
###4457 That brought him to take
###4461 Very radical solutions for them.
###4465 Would you say he was evil?
###4467 Oh, i'd definitely say he was evil.
###4468 Is there such a thing as evil?
###4470 Oh, I think there is.
###4471 And is there such a thing as good?
###4473 Oh, definitely.
###4474 And...Evil can sometimes be rationalized as science.
###4479 Oh, sure.
###4480 And evil can sometimes be rationalized--
###4482 When it's rationalized as science,
###4484 And I think when it was rationalized in this particular way,
###4486 I think hitler thought he was doing good.
###4488 He thought he was doing good?
###4489 Oh, I think so.
###4490 He thought he was benefiting humanity
###4492 By driving evolution forward
###4494 And creating a better humanity.
###4504 Before leaving dachau,
###4506 I stopped by the memorial
###4508 Commemorating the thousands of jews
###4510 Who were killed there in excruciating conditions.
###4516 I know that darwinism
###4518 Does not automatically equate to nazism.
###4521 But if darwinism inspired and justified
###4524 Such horrific events in the past,
###4526 Could it be used to rationalize
###4528 Similar initiatives today?
###4530 There's a good german expression, "so faengt es immer an."
###4533 I mean, "always begins in the same way,"
###4535 Something to remember in the context of
###4537 The united states' discussions of euthanasia and abortion.
###4540 It always begins in the same way.
###4541 There seems to be an excellent argument
###4543 For getting rid of useless people by killing them.
###4546 Or at least it seems excellent
###4547 To the people advancing the argument.
###4549 It's the love affair with death
###4551 And, you know, the euthanasia and this movement going on,
###4553 Which I find appalling.
###4555 And the idea is that, you know,
###4556 Immediately rid our society
###4558 Of anybody who might be a drain
###4559 And think of people in economic terms,
###4563 And I think that's where some of the darwin fits in, actually.
###4566 It's just a devaluing of human life.
###4568 First of all, if you take seriously
###4570 That evolution has to do with
###4571 The transition of life forms
###4574 And that life and death are just natural processes,
###4577 Then one gets to be liberal about abortion and euthanasia.
###4580 All of those kinds of ideas,
###4582 Seem to me, follow very naturally
###4584 From a darwinian perspective,
###4586 A de-privileging of human beings, basically.
###4588 And I think that people who want to endorse darwinism
###4592 Have to sort of take this kind of viewpoint very seriously.
###4595 And when we see an elite-- and it is an elite--
###4599 An elite that controls essentially
###4601 All the research money in science,
###4604 Saying, "there is no such thing as moral truth;
###4606 Science will not be related to religion."
###4609 I mean, it's essentially official policy
###4611 Of the national academy of science
###4613 That religion and science will not be related.
###4616 I mean, hey, that cuts off a lot of debate, doesn't it?
###4620 What's going to happen if this doesn't change?
###4622 I think we're watching it happen, aren't we?
###4624 I needed time to think,
###4626 So I traveled to the birthplace of this idea.
###4685 "with savages, the weak in body or mind
###4688 "are soon eliminated.
###4690 "we civilized men, on the other hand,
###4693 "do our utmost to check the process of elimination.
###4696 "we build asylums for the imbecile, the maimed, and the sick.
###4700 "thus the weak members of civilized societies
###4703 "propagate their kind.
###4705 "no one who has attended to the breeding
###4707 "of domestic animals
###4709 "will doubt that this must be highly injurious
###4711 "to the race of man.
###4713 "hardly anyone is so ignorant
###4715 As to allow his worst animals to breed."
###4718 --charles darwin, the descent of man, 1871.
###4816 [church bells tolling]
###4825 Meyer: throughout the cold war in germany,
###4826 There was this wall erected to keep ideas out.
###4829 It was erected by people who held an ideology,
###4832 That were afraid of a competition
###4834 From other ideas that would come into their society.
###4838 And what we're seeing happening in science today
###4841 Is very much like that.
###4843 But I think that's just a strategy
###4844 For protecting a failing ideology from competition.
###4848 America didn't become the great nation that it is
###4851 By suppressing ideas.
###4852 It progressed by allowing freedom of speech
###4856 And freedom of inquiry.
###4858 Thomas jefferson got it right when he wrote,
###4861 "we hold these truths to be self-evident,
###4863 "that all men are created equal,
###4866 "that they are endowed by their creator
###4868 "with certain unalienable rights,
###4870 "that among these are life, liberty,
###4872 And the pursuit of happiness."
###4875 Hundreds of thousands of americans
###4877 Have given their lives to protect these values,
###4880 But now they're under threat once again.
###4883 It wasn't just scientists who were being expelled.
###4886 It was freedom itself,
###4888 The very foundation of the american dream,
###4891 The very foundation of america.
###4894 If we allowed freedom to be expelled in science,
###4896 Where would it end?
###4898 The darwinian establishment
###4900 Is so massive and so entrenched
###4903 It appears impenetrable.
###4905 I couldn't bring it down myself,
###4907 But I could at least confront
###4908 Those who'd expelled the scientists i'd met.
###4913 What would you say if you had eugenie scott sitting next to you?
###4917 What would you say to her?
###4918 I would ask her by what authority
###4921 Does she and those like her
###4923 Presume to declare
###4926 What is and is not science.
###4929 He's sort of made himself martyr of the day.
###4931 They've gotten a lot of mileage out of,
###4933 You know, poor rick sternberg.
###4936 And we got lip service
###4937 From the leadership of the smithsonian,
###4939 But I didn't feel they ever followed through.
###4942 We went into the smithsonian looking for answers,
###4945 But we ran into the same stone wall as congressman souder.
###4948 You're not authorized to do this here, so stop.
###4951 [overlapping chatter]
###4958 He said, "nonetheless, you have to be disciplined,"
###4960 And I lost my job.
###4962 We did get an interview
###4963 With a spokesman from george mason,
###4966 But it was impossible to knock him off his script.
###4969 Her contract was not renewed.
###4971 It was simply, um, not renewing her contract,
###4975 Which she satisfied.
###4976 Her contract was not renewed.
###4979 It had nothing to do with the controversy
###4981 Of that topic of intelligent design.
###4987 I have never been treated like this in my--
###4991 About 30 years in academia.
###4993 We received a similar reception at baylor university.
###4997 They refused to admit
###4998 That what had happened to dr. Marks
###5000 Had anything to do with id.
###5002 Certainly the conversations i've had, this has not--
###5006 The intelligent design situation
###5008 Has not been the thrust of the conversation.
###5010 It was a procedural issue,
###5012 And that's the way we dealt with it.
###5014 Funny, that's not how dean kelley put things
###5017 In his original e-mail to dr. Marks.
###5026 I'm not mixing my religion with my science.
###5028 The questions that I ask
###5030 In my intelligent design research
###5032 Are perfectly legitimate scientific questions.
###5034 At least the top guns at iowa state
###5037 Were willing to own up to their actions.
###5039 What we wanted to stop is the use of the name of isu
###5042 To validate intelligent design.
###5045 And we did succeed.
###5047 I really think a lot of guillermo. He's a great guy.
###5049 So that's why i'm kind of disappointed.
###5051 He should've just left this alone,
###5053 In my opinion, should've just left it alone.
###5055 Dr. Hauptman elaborated further
###5058 On his great regard for gonzalez.
###5060 Man: uh, this is quoting an e-mail from you to mr. Avalos.
###5063 You say, "sometimes it is just best to ignore idiots,"
###5068 In reference to guillermo.
###5071 And then, "the religious nutcases
###5074 Should be challenged at every opportunity."
###5076 Yeah, because, for example,
###5078 You-- [chuckles]
###5081 In that case, i'm thinking more of,
###5083 Say, the creationist crowd, who claims that God
###5086 Put all the animals on an ark, and that's it.
###5089 That's where all of our animals came from today.
###5091 That's crazy, okay?
###5093 You shouldn't be insulting
###5094 Even children with that kind of thing.
###5096 So these are the idiots, all right?
###5098 They've always been around.
###5099 They've always been around.
###5101 Going after the perpetrators in each of these cases
###5104 Wasn't getting me anywhere.
###5106 So I reconnected with dr. Berlinski and dr. Schroeder
###5110 To see if they had any advice.
###5117 Berlinski: there's a boundary
###5119 To what science will accept right now.
###5121 I think the parallel is exactly this wall coming down.
###5124 Ask any berliner from the east side
###5127 What it meant to have the wall come down.
###5130 If it is possible to make a break in the wall,
###5135 That would allow academia
###5137 To ask these fundamental questions that exist
###5139 And allow them in the science classrooms as well.
###5145 It'd be nice to see the scientific establishment
###5148 Lose some of its prestige and power.
###5150 It'd be nice to see other questions being opened up.
###5152 Above all, it would be nice
###5154 To have a real spirit of self-criticism
###5157 Penetrating the sciences.
###5160 Stein: what can I do to bring down the wall?
###5162 Is there anything I can do?
###5164 Make it apparent to the world
###5166 That a wall exists.
###5167 There are vast numbers of persons
###5169 Who talk about academic freedom,
###5171 And there is academic freedom
###5174 As long as you're on the correct side of the wall.
###5177 But if you're on the wrong side of the wall,
###5179 As you mentioned a few moments ago,
###5180 You lose tenure, and that's a given.
###5183 I took dr. Schroeder's words to heart.
###5187 Obviously I couldn't take down the wall myself,
###5190 But I could confront one of its modern architects.
###5245 Hello, professor dawkins. How are you?
###5248 I'm ben stein, i'm so sorry to keep you waiting.
###5251 - how are you? - fine, thank you.
###5254 You have-- you have written
###5256 That God is a psychotic delinquent
###5259 Invented by mad, deluded people.
###5261 No, I didn't say quite that.
###5263 I said something rather better than that.
###5265 Oh, well, please tell us what you said.
###5267 Well, I would have to read it from the book.
###5269 No, please.
###5271 "the God of the old testament
###5273 "is arguably the most unpleasant character
###5275 "in all fiction--
###5276 "jealous and proud of it,
###5278 "a petty, unjust, unforgiving control freak,
###5281 "a vindictive, bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser,
###5283 "a misogynistic, homophobic,
###5285 "racist, infanticidal, genocidal, filicidal,
###5289 "pestilential, megalomaniacal,
###5291 "sadomasochistic,
###5292 Capriciously malevolent bully."
###5294 - so that's what you think of God. - yeah.
###5296 How about if people believed in a God
###5298 Of infinite lovingness and kindness
###5301 And forgiveness and generosity,
###5303 Sort of like the modern-day God.
###5306 Why spoil it for them?
###5308 - oh, um-- - why not just let them have their fun and enjoy it?
###5312 I don't want to spoil anything for anybody.
###5315 I write a book. People can read it if they want to.
###5317 I believe that it is a liberating thing
###5321 To free yourself from primitive superstition.
###5325 So religion's a primitive superstition?
###5326 Oh, I think it is, yes.
###5328 So, uh, you believe it's liberating
###5331 To tell people that there is no God.
###5333 I think a lot of people, when they give up God,
###5336 Feel a great sense of release and freedom.
###5340 Why do you think that?
###5341 - you're a scientist. What's your data? - well, I...
###5344 Well, i've had a lot of letters saying that.
###5346 There're eight billion people in the world, dr. Dawkins.
###5349 Yeah, I know, I know...
###5350 How many letters have you had?
###5351 No, I-- that's quite true.
###5353 Professor dawkins seemed so convinced that God doesn't exist
###5357 That I wondered if he would be willing to put a number on it.
###5360 Well, it's hard to put a figure on it,
###5362 But i'd put it as something like,
###5365 You know, 99% against or something--
###5367 Well, how do you know it's 99% and not, say, 97%?
###5370 I don't. You asked me to put a figure on it,
###5372 And i'm not comfortable putting a figure on it.
###5375 I think it's-- I just think it's very unlikely.
###5378 But you couldn't put a number on it.
###5381 No, of course not.
###5382 So it could be 49%.
###5384 Well, it would be-- I mean, I think it's unlikely,
###5388 And it's quite far from 50%.
###5391 How do you know?
###5393 I don't know.
###5394 I mean, I put an argument in the book.
###5396 Then who did create the heavens and the earth?
###5398 Why do you use the word "who?"
###5399 You see, you immediately beg the question
###5401 By using the word "who."
###5403 Then how did it get created?
###5405 Well, um... By a very slow process.
###5409 Well, how did it start?
###5411 Nobody knows how it got started.
###5413 We know the kind of event that it must've been.
###5415 We know the sort of event that must've happened
###5417 - for the origin of life. - what was that?
###5419 It was the origin of the first self-replicating molecule.
###5423 Right, and how did that happen?
###5425 I've told you, we don't know.
###5427 So you have no idea how it started?
###5429 No, no. Nor has anybody.
###5431 Nor has anyone else.
###5432 What do you think is the possibility
###5434 That intelligent design
###5435 Might turn out to be
###5437 The answer to some issues in genetics
###5440 Or in evolution?
###5442 It could come about in the following way.
###5444 It could be that at some earlier time,
###5448 Somewhere in the universe,
###5449 A civilization evolved
###5453 By probably some kind of darwinian means
###5455 To a very, very high level of technology
###5458 And designed a form of life
###5460 That they seeded onto, perhaps, this planet.
###5463 Now, that is a possibility and an intriguing possibility,
###5469 And I suppose it's possible that you might find evidence for that.
###5472 If you look at the detail--
###5475 Details of biochemistry, molecular biology,
###5478 You might find a signature of some sort of designer.
###5481 Wait a second.
###5482 Richard dawkins thought intelligent design
###5485 Might be a legitimate pursuit?
###5487 And that designer could well be a higher intelligence
###5491 From elsewhere in the universe.
###5494 - well-- - but that higher intelligence
###5496 Would itself have had to have come about
###5498 By some explicable or ultimately explicable process.
###5502 It couldn't have just jumped into existence spontaneously. That's the point.
###5506 So professor dawkins was not against intelligent design,
###5511 Just certain types of designers,
###5513 Such as God.
###5515 So the hebrew God,
###5517 The God of the old testament--
###5518 He doesn't exist in your view?
###5521 Uh, certainly.
###5522 I mean, that would be a very unpleasant prospect.
###5525 And the holy trinity of the new testament--
###5528 No, nothing like that.
###5529 Do you believe in any of the hindu Gods?
###5533 - like vishnu? - how can you ask such a question?
###5535 - you don't, right? - how could I?
###5536 I mean, why would I,
###5537 Given that I don't believe in any others?
###5539 You don't believe in the moslem God.
###5540 No. Why do you even need to ask?
###5544 I just wanted to be sure.
###5545 So you don't believe in any God anywhere.
###5549 Any God anywhere would be completely incompatible
###5552 With--with anything that i've said in--
###5557 I assumed, I just wanted to make sure
###5560 You don't believe in any God anywhere.
###5562 - no. - what if after you died, you ran into God.
###5565 He said, "what have you been doing, richard?
###5568 "I mean, what have you been doing?
###5569 "i've been trying to be nice to you.
###5570 "I gave you a multimillion-dollar paycheck
###5573 "over and over again with your book,
###5575 And look what you did."
###5577 Bertram russell had that point put to him,
###5579 And he said something like,
###5582 "sir, why did you take such pains to hide yourself?"
###5589 But if the intelligent design people are right,
###5592 God isn't hidden.
###5594 We may even be able to encounter God through science
###5598 If we have the freedom to go there.
###5601 What could be more intriguing than that?
###5608 [at podium] we take freedom for granted
###5611 Here in the United States.
###5613 Freedom is what this country is all about.
###5617 And a huge part of freedom is freedom of inquiry.
###5621 But now, i'm sorry to say,
###5623 Freedom of inquiry in science is being suppressed.
###5627 Behind me stands a wall
###5629 That encircles the free sectors of this city,
###5633 Part of a vast system of barriers.
###5636 There are people out there
###5638 Who want to keep science in a little box
###5640 Where it can't possibly touch a higher power,
###5643 Cannot possibly touch God.
###5645 Those barriers cut across germany
###5647 In a gash of barbed wire,
###5649 Concrete, dog runs, and guard towers.
###5654 If you believe in God
###5655 And you believe that there is
###5657 An intrinsic order in the universe
###5659 And you believe that it's the role of science
###5661 To try to pursue and understand better that order,
###5664 You will be ostracized.
###5666 I'm frightened by this,
###5669 But i'm not going to let it stop me
###5670 From investigating or from speaking.
###5672 The wall cannot withstand freedom.
###5676 What i'm asking for is the freedom
###5679 To follow the evidence wherever it leads.
###5684 My hope is that there'll be enough
###5685 Independent-thinking scientists
###5687 Who don't like to be told what to think.
###5689 People on both sides of the argument
###5692 Being prepared to talk and listen,
###5695 And, above all, a willingness
###5697 To keep these dialogues open.
###5699 It might allow a lot of very good scientists
###5702 To be scientists,
###5704 Who aren't allowed to be scientists right now.
###5706 I don't care what they end up as being.
###5709 I don't care if they end up being religious
###5711 Or young-earth creationists.
###5713 If they have thought their way
###5714 Through the issues and get there,
###5716 I'm all for them.
###5718 And why do I think we're going to win in this struggle?
###5721 Because truth crushed to earth will rise again.
###5724 To find out what's true has a value all of its own.
###5727 If it has additional good consequences, so be it.
###5730 Because no lie can live forever.
###5733 I believe that science gives us one perspective on the world,
###5736 And our religious insight gives us another perspective on the world.
###5738 By putting the two together,
###5740 Then we'll see more deeply and more truly.
###5743 And if we will stand up for freedom...
###5745 Freedom is the victor.
###5748 If we all do that, we will overcome.
###5751 [the killer's "all these things that i've done" plays]
###5755 [audience applauding]
###5756  all these things that i've done
###5760  yeah, you're gonna bring yourself down
###5765  yeah, you're gonna bring yourself down
###5771 I've taken a first step
###5773 By speaking out on this issue.
###5775 But if the wall is to come down,
###5777 We all have to do our part.
###5778 Some of you will pay a heavy price for speaking out.
###5781 You may even lose your job.
###5783 I guarantee you you'll get hate e-mail.
###5786 But if you don't get involved,
###5789 Will anyone be left to carry on the struggle?
###5792 Anyone?
###5793 Anyone?
###5797  I got soul, but i'm not a soldier
###5802  I got soul, but i'm not a soldier
###5806  I got soul, but i'm not a soldier
###5810  I got soul, but i'm not a soldier
###5814  I got soul, but i'm not a soldier
###5827  yeah, you know you got to help me out
###5832  yeah, oh don't you put me on the back burner
###5837  you know you got to help me out
###5840  yeah, you're gonna bring yourself down
###5844  yeah, you're gonna bring yourself down
###5849  yeah, oh don't you put me on the back burner
###5854  you're gonna bring yourself down
###5857  yeah, you're gonna bring yourself down
###5861  over and in
###5865  last call for sin
###5869  while everyone's lost, the battle is won
###5874  with all these things that i've done
