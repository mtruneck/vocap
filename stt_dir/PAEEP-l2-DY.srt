this is literally the second year in a
row that's electronica arts has been


4
0:0:13,469 --> 0:0:16,91
voted the worst company in america had
no part of the reason why this happened


5
0:0:16,91 --> 0:0:21,349
is because i'd be screwed up the release
of uh... sim city


6
0:0:21,349 --> 0:0:25,899
and a lot of people are upset because i
uh... servers are crashing and play it


7
0:0:25,899 --> 0:0:29,629
players weren't able to even access the
gamecube orchard get to the microphone


8
0:0:29,629 --> 0:0:33,839
because i'm asking her questions back in
march of course is our high you donor


9
0:0:33,839 --> 0:0:37,989
dillard host issue knows a lot about
electronics and about video games soak


10
0:0:37,989 --> 0:0:42,67
and why were people so upset about sim
city what was the dramas behind that


11
0:0:42,67 --> 0:0:43,94
location where


12
0:0:43,94 --> 0:0:47,26
uh... and hasn't always on the air and


13
0:0:47,26 --> 0:0:50,78
mandatory which means you have to be
online connected online to play the game


14
0:0:50,78 --> 0:0:54,9
about even if you're playing
single-player with no


15
0:0:54,9 --> 0:0:58,98
connected it to anyone at all and the
palette that was everyone to play for


16
0:0:58,98 --> 0:1:0,97
the service dot clock


17
0:1:0,97 --> 0:1:4,72
a lot of people couldn't play that they
put it off and eat didn't really came


18
0:1:4,72 --> 0:1:6,29
with well they said


19
0:1:6,29 --> 0:1:10,28
people want always iberian people like
you and the truth is everyone fuckin


20
0:1:10,28 --> 0:1:12,7
hates that shit


21
0:1:12,7 --> 0:1:14,1
it's ironic that a bunch of video game
people


22
0:1:14,1 --> 0:1:16,27
complain with themselves and


23
0:1:16,27 --> 0:1:18,61
by and


24
0:1:18,61 --> 0:1:19,299
all right


25
0:1:19,299 --> 0:1:23,79
so obvious and i just updated understand
but if i was a video game player or a


26
0:1:23,79 --> 0:1:27,67
gamer as as they like to refer to
themselves


27
0:1:27,67 --> 0:1:32,69
it's high time and i i they couldn't sit
on their computer and internet if you


28
0:1:32,69 --> 0:1:36,92
had to be on my daughter and i don't
like people were crashing the self if


29
0:1:36,92 --> 0:1:40,799
you want to pay sixty dollars for a gay
you can't possibly hope to play


30
0:1:40,799 --> 0:1:43,7
uh... florida function that's completely
unnecessary


31
0:1:43,7 --> 0:1:46,96
yes no i doubt it would i would really
irritating and i'm not saying that


32
0:1:46,96 --> 0:1:50,56
sarcastically so i totally understand
their frustration i mean he said to me


33
0:1:50,56 --> 0:1:53,649
because i keep there's a video game
player in like the ladies


34
0:1:53,649 --> 0:1:58,37
with sega genesis n_b_a_ made all the
best sports games and not be a


35
0:1:58,37 --> 0:2:1,83
so this does kinda make it said but i
thought that the letter


36
0:2:1,83 --> 0:2:5,39
that the c_e_o_'s and average was kind
of thing


37
0:2:5,39 --> 0:2:8,61
so he says and in the past year we have
received thousands of emails and


38
0:2:8,61 --> 0:2:11,76
postcards protesting against eighty
eight for allowing players to create


39
0:2:11,76 --> 0:2:13,979
elegy bt characters in our day


40
0:2:13,979 --> 0:2:18,629
this week we cinco some conservative
websites urging people to protest are


41
0:2:18,629 --> 0:2:23,589
algae bt policy by voting eating a the
worst company in america that's an


42
0:2:23,589 --> 0:2:26,39
interesting accusation i don't know i am
if


43
0:2:26,39 --> 0:2:31,34
kid that's what's putting email over the
edge right uh... but if that's really


44
0:2:31,34 --> 0:2:33,879
happening that's disgusting behavior


45
0:2:33,879 --> 0:2:38,619
how much will work in the anti date
people get break how much lower comming


46
0:2:38,619 --> 0:2:42,709
diego this date you know it's not only
in the real world not like the people in


47
0:2:42,709 --> 0:2:44,47
this world that we all live in


48
0:2:44,47 --> 0:2:45,68
we actually don't like them too


49
0:2:45,68 --> 0:2:49,94
like sixteen-bit anymore you know we
really like the number two what what we


50
0:2:49,94 --> 0:2:51,37
believe that's the case


51
0:2:51,37 --> 0:2:52,129
that they had


52
0:2:52,129 --> 0:2:56,9
you know campaigns and mailing lists
then that you know again this is where


53
0:2:56,9 --> 0:4:56,9
you got it back in the area of the boys
so they're getting ahead of for it
