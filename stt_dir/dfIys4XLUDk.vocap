###27 LEVI: My name is Levi.
###29 And I am one of the guides in the Impenetrable Forest.
###31 
###34 Now this here Bwindi Forest is the forest very special for
###38 being a home to critically endangered mountain gorillas.
###41 Yeah, we are going to start the gorilla tracking journey.
###44 And which will take us possibly the whole day into
###49 the Bwindi Impenetrable Forest, an island within the
###53 communities.
###54 When you look at the map of Africa, you get Uganda, then
###58 bordering Congo, DRC, that is the location of Bwindi.
###66 We started in an open place, and you can see here where we
###69 are going, this is a primary forest now.
###72 
###77 DR. RICHARD CARROLL: Mountain gorillas only exist on that
###81 patch of habitat in the mountains of the Virungas.
###85 And they only exist in those three countries, in just a
###89 real small area.
###91 They're not in zoos.
###93 The zoo population of gorillas are western lowland gorillas,
###97 for the most part.
###99 So this is it.
###100 Their whole survival rests in this patch of habitat that's
###105 really isolated on these mountaintops.
###107 And there's only 720 of them that exist in the world.
###110 And they're all in this area And it's
###112 surrounded by a sea of humans.
###116 LEVI: These mountain gorillas, they are the great apes.
###121 Human beings are also the great apes.
###123 The behaviors, the way they behave when you look at them,
###126 it's very, very marvelous.
###128 They behave like people, like human beings.
###133 DR. RICHARD CARROLL: The first time that you see a gorilla
###136 through that veil of vegetation, and he's looking
###140 at you, and you look at him, and you catch him in the eye,
###143 and it's really clear that there's a species connection.
###147 We share a good part of our genes, and you can see so much
###152 of human behavior reflected or derived from behavior of some
###158 of the great apes.
###162 LEVI: Mountain Gorillas are 99% vegetarians.
###166 Most of the food they eat is leaves, bark
###169 of trees, and fruits.
###172 But 1% to make 100% of their food is the ants.
###179 So they change that diet by eating ants,
###182 actually to get proteins.
###183 
###186 DR. RICHARD CARROLL: Opening up the forest with coffee
###187 plantations and logging companies from Yugoslavia and
###191 the French to Spanish to Dutch, when they came in to
###195 get that very valuable hardwood out of the forest.
###198 And of course, they're bringing labor
###201 from around the country.
###202 So the population demographics changed drastically.
###205 So it's a very dense human population with agriculture
###210 bordering right up to the parks.
###213 LEVI: Lifespan of these mountain gorillas is 50 years,
###217 here in the wild.
###219 But when the people started settling around, then they
###222 started clearing their habitat for farming.
###225 And also killing them.
###227 Then they started becoming very few.
###229 Their numbers started reducing.
###231 Bwindi has about half of the world's population,
###235 which is about 340.
###239 DR. RICHARD CARROLL: Bushmeat refers to the capture and
###242 killing of wild game for commercial purposes.
###246 They set snares on wildlife trails that are totally
###250 indiscriminate.
###252 And even gorillas get caught in them.
###254 It'll tighten around its hand or foot, and
###256 the hand will atrophy.
###258 So there's a lot of mutilation and mortality from these
###263 snares that are ubiquitous around the forest.
###267 And so the real threats right now are human population
###270 growth, it's the main threat.
###272 Insecurity.
###274 This area has been an area of political
###277 instability for a long time.
###279 In all three countries, there's been national
###281 conflicts and regional conflicts.
###283 Uganda went through years of the most horrible dictatorship
###288 under Idi Amin, where wildlife populations were decimated
###292 throughout the country.
###293 Rwanda went through a genocide.
###295 DRC has been at war since 1993 and before.
###299 Millions of people died in those wars.
###302 Millions of people displaced.
###305 It goes on to right now.
###307 
###314 LEVI: OK, this side where we are overlooking is Bwindi
###316 Impenetrable Forest.
###318 And as you go to the slope, on this side is DRC.
###324 And where you see across, you see the bananas, that's the
###327 village on the Uganda side.
###330 But if you go beyond, then you are in the DRC.
###333 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###350 LEVI: When we get to the gorillas, we will have a sound
###354 that we make.
###355 We imitate their vocalization so that they come down, they
###359 know we are friendly, we have no problem to them.
###362 And that's Sowendi That vocalization is [GROWLING ].
###365 
###372 Like cause they also communicate.
###374 
###378 They live with families, headed by silverbacks.
###381 And having only one dominant silverback, only one lead
###385 male, who leads the whole family.
###390 DR. RICHARD CARROLL: The first time I saw mountain gorillas
###392 was in the Bwindi National Park in Uganda.
###395 And when we got up there, the silverback gave us a really
###400 great sideways sort of false charge to let us know that he
###406 was the boss.
###407 Interestingly, that silverback was missing a hand from a
###412 snare wound.
###413 
###415 What you need to do when you're around gorillas is do
###418 everything you can do to look submissive.
###422 Slowly go down to the ground, pretend like you're feeding on
###425 leaves, and sort of act like a monkey, which comes sort of
###428 naturally to some of us anyways.
###431 But running is the wrong thing.
###434 LEVI: If one dominant silverback
###435 start getting weak--
###437 he's very weak, he cannot protect the family--
###440 he leaves the powers to the youngest, who is very strong
###443 enough to defend the family.
###447 But sometime they can fight.
###449 We don't have any evidence that they have
###451 ever fought to death.
###453 But they can fight and harm each other.
###456 During the fighting of some primates, they kill those
###461 babies so that they can now have the females in the estrus
###466 period and start the mating process and also
###469 produce their own.
###470 That's how we get new groups, new families started.
###476 We are communicating with the trackers.
###478 They are just in front of us some few meters.
###480 
###483 When you see the trackers that means the gorillas are near.
###488 The guys have already done a wonderful job of
###490 locating them to us.
###491 MEDI: He has located the gorillas.
###494 They have started from where they left them yesterday.
###497 The smell also helps them.
###500 Mostly the smell from the armpits of the silverback.
###503 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###511 LEVI: When you get to the gorillas, we branch into the
###513 bush to directly where the gorillas are.
###518 As I told you that they very, very closely related to us,
###521 and we are visiting them everyday, so at times we also
###524 monitor to see maybe they could get like some germs,
###528 some bacterias, parasites from human beings.
###532 The jungle here is very dense.
###535 So you may be asking yourselves, how do we know the
###537 population.
###539 We found the last night nests, which are here.
###543 And then when we want to know group categories, we have to
###547 look at the dung.
###547 For the babies it's small.
###549 The juveniles, also small a bit.
###553 Then adult female also small somehow.
###557 But for the silverback it's big.
###559 And as he said that when trackers are following, they
###563 have got signs they go looking for.
###565 So for them they were looking for the feedings like these
###568 ones, which they have left behind.
###571 DR. RICHARD CARROLL: There's only 720 of them that
###572 exist in the world.
###574 And they're all in this area.
###575 And there's pressures for other resources.
###578 With minerals, [INAUDIBLE], gold, oil and gas, it has huge
###586 threats for the future.
###587 What happened in the Virunga National Park in DRC, where 10
###591 gorillas were killed was a combination of an economic and
###596 a political statement.
###598 It wasn't poaching by local communities for food or for
###602 subsistence.
###603 The tensions are still there from the conflict between
###607 Rwanda and DRC.
###610 There's many rebel factions that are hiding
###614 out in those forests.
###616 Supplying charcoal to the cities, transporting it to do
###622 the population centers was a multimillion dollar operation
###627 that was helping to support a lot of these rebel factions
###630 and keep them in business, allow them to function.
###633 And they were working through the local population.
###636 It's also a sign the presence of conservation was getting on
###641 their nerves, so they were not able to operate with impunity.
###644 So they were making a sign.
###646 You guys care so much about these mountain gorillas, well
###650 we're gonna make a sign that's really going to have
###652 an impact on you.
###654 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###675 MEDI: So some gorillas are going up in the tree.
###678 
###683 [GROWLING]
###711 [GORILLA NOISES]
###729 DR. RICHARD CARROLL: Gorillas really hold a real
###730 fascination, I think, from history.
###733 All of us grew up with Tarzan movies and King Kong.
###737 And they've always held a mystery.
###739 And they're always so close to humans, but the
###744 image of being so strong.
###746 And often a mistaken image of them being so ferocious.
###750 
###779 [GROWLING]
###794 DR. RICHARD CARROLL: A silverback gorilla is big.
###796 It weighs 400 pounds and has big canines and a huge jaw to
###800 defend his harem.
###804 So he's defending his resources, as well.
###809 That exists in our primate memory that
###815 carries on to today.
###816 
###835 -He's picking his nose.
###836 
###838 -He is.
###839 He just ate it.
###840 
###865 DR. RICHARD CARROLL: Gorillas live in pretty low density.
###868 There's aggression between the silverbacks trying to compete
###871 for females and things like that.
###875 But there's enough room.
###877 
###881 We are in such high population densities
###883 in a shrinking planet.
###885 Right now with the amount of people on this planet we need
###888 two planets to support us.
###890 And it's going to lead to more and more
###892 conflict over resources.
###894 We're producing climate change that's going to change those
###897 resources and make them scarcer.
###899 All the time it's more people.
###900 
###904 And I felt from the beginning that if we as humans can't
###912 protect our closest family relatives then we really will
###917 fail as a species ourselves.
