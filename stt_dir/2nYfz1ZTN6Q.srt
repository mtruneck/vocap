Life just couldn't seem to get this
evolution thing right: Did it start on land,


2
0:0:5,64 --> 0:0:12,83
or the sea? And just how many times did
it cross over from land to sea? And why


3
0:0:12,83 --> 0:0:16,8
should we believe the fishy fishapod
story?  this is Genesis Week.

16
0:1:20,38 --> 0:1:24,48
Today we're going to cover a composite
of several news items from the past week.


17
0:1:24,48 --> 0:1:28,55
The first article, loaded with a lot of
evolutionary assumptions and written by


18
0:1:28,55 --> 0:1:36,22
Mulkidjanian et al appeared in PNAS.
Citing the problems of life arising in the


19
0:1:36,22 --> 0:1:40,24
oceans, as well as a contrast of the
chemical composition of what is believed


20
0:1:40,24 --> 0:1:43,83
to be the first life, with the chemical
content in the water of hot springs on


21
0:1:43,83 --> 0:1:49,11
land.  Their conclusion: the first life must
have started in hot springs on land and


22
0:1:49,11 --> 0:1:54,81
not the ocean.  Now there are a few
problematic facts here: no one was there


23
0:1:54,81 --> 0:1:58,62
at the beginning to  get a sample of the
first life, so the organisms of which they


24
0:1:58,62 --> 0:2:5,46
were comparing chemical composition are
assumed to have been the first life.  Such


25
0:2:5,46 --> 0:2:9,68
assumptions are also ignoring the glaring
issues of chemicals assembling into life in


26
0:2:9,68 --> 0:2:12,94
direct violation of scientific and natural
laws. Then there are the other


27
0:2:12,94 --> 0:2:17,7
evolutionary scientists who claimed that
land was inhospitable for life 3.8 billion


28
0:2:17,7 --> 0:2:23,1
years ago due to meteor bombardment,
therefore life had to have started in the


29
0:2:23,1 --> 0:2:24,6
oceans!


30
0:2:24,6 --> 0:2:28,57
Only a couple of weeks prior to the PNAS
article, the South African Journal of


31
0:2:28,57 --> 0:2:33,3
Science carried a report by Brain,et al, on
what is claimed to be our earliest animal


32
0:2:33,3 --> 0:2:41,39
ancestor - a sponge allegedly 760 million
years old.  This fossil sponge was found in


33
0:2:41,39 --> 0:2:45,93
limestone which evolutionary geologists
have deduced was deposited on the


34
0:2:45,93 --> 0:2:51,6
ocean floor, so obviously this sponge
lived in the ocean.


35
0:2:51,6 --> 0:2:55,52
Still yet another article of interest came
out this past week in The Proceedings of


36
0:2:55,52 --> 0:3:0,4
the Royal Society by Vega and Wiens
who, using cladistic comparisons,


37
0:3:0,4 --> 0:3:5,67
concluded that the majority of saltwater
fishes evolved from freshwater fish


38
0:3:5,67 --> 0:3:10,5
ancestors.  I'm going to ignore all of the
evolutionary assumptions involved here,


39
0:3:10,5 --> 0:3:14,81
as cladistics do not prove nor disprove
evolution, they are simply interpreted


40
0:3:14,81 --> 0:3:19,11
within the evolutionary paradigm, and
evolution was simply assumed within the


41
0:3:19,11 --> 0:3:23,2
comparisons.  But let's assume for the
moment that they are correct.


42
0:3:23,2 --> 0:3:27,95
You'll also recall a couple of weeks back
where I mentioned a British Museum of


43
0:3:27,95 --> 0:3:32,56
Natural History article talking about the
venerable Horseshoe crab. I pointed out


44
0:3:32,56 --> 0:3:37,57
how it hasn't changed in some 450 million
years according to the evolutionary


45
0:3:37,57 --> 0:3:41,56
timescale.  The British Museum article
even pointed out that the horseshoe crab


46
0:3:41,56 --> 0:3:46,85
has remained unchanged even though it
survived 3 of earth's major extinction


47
0:3:46,85 --> 0:3:51,4
events!  Several people objected
vociferously to my comments, citing the


48
0:3:51,4 --> 0:3:56,21
usual evolutionary mantra that change
only occurs because of environmental


49
0:3:56,21 --> 0:4:0,72
pressures - the horseshoe crab saw no
change in its environment, therefore it did


50
0:4:0,72 --> 0:4:2,29
not change!


51
0:4:2,29 --> 0:4:8,1
Really? Well try to tell that to the trilobites
who are now apparently extinct, yet lived


52
0:4:8,1 --> 0:4:14,42
in the same environment, right alongside
the horseshoe crabs. But better yet - let's


53
0:4:14,42 --> 0:4:20,7
examine the coelacanth, which also lived
in the ocean, unchanged,  in some 407


54
0:4:20,7 --> 0:4:25,5
million years as it is still around today -
yet the coelacanth was consdiered part of


55
0:4:25,5 --> 0:4:30,64
the line of fishapod ancestors - the half
fish/half tetrapod line.  You know - the


56
0:4:30,64 --> 0:4:34,24
evolutionary descent where the fish grew
legs and walked up onto land to become


57
0:4:34,24 --> 0:4:41,21
land dwelling creatures? So, did the
coelacanth change, or didn't it? Did it


58
0:4:41,21 --> 0:4:46,36
experience environmental pressures to
change? Or didn't it?


59
0:4:46,36 --> 0:4:49,88
According to the evolution myth, once
land creatures evolved, they got bored of


60
0:4:49,88 --> 0:4:55,31
the land and went back into the sea,
evolving into sea creatures.  Last fall,


61
0:4:55,31 --> 0:4:59,91
Motani delivered a paper at the Society
for Vertebrate Paleontology showing how


62
0:4:59,91 --> 0:5:4,48
it appears that the plesiasaurs and
ichthyosaurs evolved their way back into


63
0:5:4,48 --> 0:5:9,97
the seas from an unknown, cold-blooded
ancestor, in tropical areas.  It's simply


64
0:5:9,97 --> 0:5:13,5
assumed that plesiasaurs and
ichthyosaurs were cold blooded cause


65
0:5:13,5 --> 0:5:17,65
nobody has actually checked the body
temperature of a living plesiasaur or


66
0:5:17,65 --> 0:5:22,42
ichthyosaur. (ichty screams)  For some reason, cold
blooded marine reptiles, dolphins, whales,


67
0:5:22,42 --> 0:5:28,87
and 28 other groups of marine creatures
all evolved back into ocean dwelling


68
0:5:28,87 --> 0:5:32,82
creatures from land animals, according to
the evolution myth.


69
0:5:32,82 --> 0:5:38,51
So - before we go any farther, let us line
up all of these reports to paint an


70
0:5:38,51 --> 0:5:43,66
evolutionary picture thus far.  I mean no
offense to my evolutionary friends, but


71
0:5:43,66 --> 0:5:49,29
you need to see just how ridiculous the
story has become:


72
0:5:49,29 --> 0:5:53,87
According to all of this latest and greatest
evolutionary research, the first life arose


73
0:5:53,87 --> 0:5:58,91
in warm ponds or perhaps hot springs on
land.  This first life somehow survived the


74
0:5:58,91 --> 0:6:4,1
alleged heavy meteor bombardment of
earth.  Perhaps this life was blasted out of


75
0:6:4,1 --> 0:6:7,22
the hot springs and into the ocean - I
don't know, I wasn't there and neither


76
0:6:7,22 --> 0:6:13,81
were you. All we do "know" is that
somehow THIS life wound up in the


77
0:6:13,81 --> 0:6:19,57
oceans and evolved into a sponge.  That
sponge allegedly evolved into a fish,


78
0:6:19,57 --> 0:6:22,98
which decided it preferred freshwater
instead of salt water, and moved into the


79
0:6:22,98 --> 0:6:26,98
rivers, streams and lakes of the
continents.  It diversified. Apparently


80
0:6:26,98 --> 0:6:30,79
those fish got bored and went back out
into the ocean, where after diversifying


81
0:6:30,79 --> 0:6:35,8
some more, got bored of the ocean, grew
legs and walked up onto land.  These land


82
0:6:35,8 --> 0:6:38,72
creatures diversified and some of those
land creatures got bored and decided


83
0:6:38,72 --> 0:6:42,73
they wanted to live in the oceans again,
so they evolved into sea dwelling


84
0:6:42,73 --> 0:6:53,32
creatures.  31 different times 31 different
groups of land creatures evolved into sea


85
0:6:53,32 --> 0:6:55,54
creatures.


86
0:6:55,54 --> 0:7:1,44
All this time, the horseshoe crab, sea
pens, tadpole shrimp, bristle worms,


87
0:7:1,44 --> 0:7:7,83
limpits, sea lancelets, sea anenomes,
stromatalites, jellyfish, and fishes like the


88
0:7:7,83 --> 0:7:11,88
coelacanth, didn't evolve whatsoever.  


89
0:7:11,88 --> 0:7:16,12
In fact that transition from fish to
landlubber is an interesting tale which I've


90
0:7:16,12 --> 0:7:19,24
discussed on the show before. The
coelacanth was considered to be the


91
0:7:19,24 --> 0:7:24,34
precursor to the tetrapod, because of its
four, large lobed fins - CLEARLY a fish


92
0:7:24,34 --> 0:7:29,12
attempting to evolve legs to walk on land!
This was believed in spite of the fact that


93
0:7:29,12 --> 0:7:33,1
the coelacanth doesn't even have a spine
- it has a notochord - which is like a


94
0:7:33,1 --> 0:7:37,39
rubber tube in place of a spine.  The
coelacanth vanishes from the fossil


95
0:7:37,39 --> 0:7:41,86
record at the end of what is called the
cretaceous - or about 65 million years ago


96
0:7:41,86 --> 0:7:46,38
according to the evolutionary timescale.
Assumed extinct, it was sensational to


97
0:7:46,38 --> 0:7:53,23
find them alive, swimming off the coast of
Africa in the 1930's. This was just as


98
0:7:53,23 --> 0:7:56,92
stunning as finding a stegasaurus
nibbling on your garden vegetables.


99
0:7:56,92 --> 0:8:2,25
There it was - living in very deep water
with absolutely no interest in walking on


100
0:8:2,25 --> 0:8:8,8
land.  And if it was still around unchanged,
then that would mean it had nothing to do


101
0:8:8,8 --> 0:8:11,1
with fishapod evolution.


102
0:8:11,1 --> 0:8:14,74
However, evolutionists believed they had
a pretty good fossil sequence of fish to


103
0:8:14,74 --> 0:8:19,71
tetrapod - a four legged amphibian.  Now,
ignoring the speculative nature of off it,


104
0:8:19,71 --> 0:8:28,5
there was a missing link if you will, a gap
in the sequence, right at the 375 million


105
0:8:28,5 --> 0:8:33,48
year mark.  So Neil Shubin from the U of
Chicago, took a team up to the Canadian


106
0:8:33,48 --> 0:8:41,77
high arctic in 2004 to go looking for this
missing link in 375 million year old rock.


107
0:8:41,77 --> 0:8:45,86
They found what they believed they were
looking for - Tiktaalik.


108
0:8:45,86 --> 0:8:50,84
Tiktaalik was heralded as such a stunning
discovery - and victory - for evolution,


109
0:8:50,84 --> 0:8:56,25
after all, evolution had actually made a
prediction and it was fulfilled!


110
0:8:56,25 --> 0:9:1,96
The anti-creation blog the sensuous
curmugeon went hog wild over Tiktaalik


111
0:9:1,96 --> 0:9:29,85
saying in their August 10, 2009 blog post:


112
0:9:29,85 --> 0:9:34,75
Actually, it is the scientific evidence that
prohibits one species evolving into


113
0:9:34,75 --> 0:9:38,95
another, but I digress
They referred to what they said in a


114
0:9:38,95 --> 0:10:40,81
previous, July 7 post of the same year
discussing the spectacular Tiktaalik find :


115
0:10:40,81 --> 0:10:45,96
Wow! Slam dunk right? Not only did they
have what sure looked like an impressive


116
0:10:45,96 --> 0:10:52,38
sequence of fossil transition from fish to
tetrapod, they even made a prediction


117
0:10:52,38 --> 0:10:58,45
based on evolutionary theory and found a
fishapod to fill in the gap!


118
0:10:58,45 --> 0:11:6,27
But neither geology nor evolutionary
theory predicted what had already been


119
0:11:6,27 --> 0:11:13,94
discovered in 2002 - before the discovery
of Tiktaalik - fossil tetrapod footprints in


120
0:11:13,94 --> 0:11:22,44
rocks dated by evolutionary geologists as
395 million years old.  OOoooops!


121
0:11:22,44 --> 0:11:28,1
So based on the evolutionary
assumptions, tetrapods were obviously


122
0:11:28,1 --> 0:11:33,1
already around with fully formed legs,
wrists, feet, toes, etc., before ANY of the


123
0:11:33,1 --> 0:11:39,51
fishapods that were allegedly trying to
evolve legs, wrists, feet and toes.


124
0:11:39,51 --> 0:11:44,61
Some have tried to desperately salvage
Tiktaalik, saying "Oh maybe the age is off


125
0:11:44,61 --> 0:11:48,24
a little bit" - for example, the Royal Tyrell
Museum in Drumheller Alberta


126
0:11:48,24 --> 0:11:53,48
mysteriously has Tiktaalik's age listed as
400 million years old - even everyone else


127
0:11:53,48 --> 0:11:59,2
lists its age as 375 million years old.  While
there's a lot of women out there who


128
0:11:59,2 --> 0:12:3,7
would love to be able to change their age
like that, changing Tiktaalik's age does


129
0:12:3,7 --> 0:12:8,8
not fix the problem.  You can't change the
date of Tiktaalik without abandoning the


130
0:12:8,8 --> 0:12:13,57
alleged "predictions" that evolution and
evolutionary geology made. You can't


131
0:12:13,57 --> 0:12:20,2
change the date of Tiktaalik without
changing the date of all the other


132
0:12:20,2 --> 0:12:25,73
fishapods. And if you were wrong on all of
those dates, then where on earth are you


133
0:12:25,73 --> 0:12:30,43
getting these dates? Clearly your dating
and assembly of the fossils cannot be


134
0:12:30,43 --> 0:12:35,69
trusted! The Polish footprints didn't just
throw Tiktaalik out of the evolutionary


135
0:12:35,69 --> 0:12:40,37
tree - it threw out all of these fishapods.


136
0:12:40,37 --> 0:12:53,0
The sensuous curmugeon finished off
their August 2009 post with the question


137
0:12:53,0 --> 0:12:56,88
Now that the Poland fossil footprints have
thoroughly destroyed all the predictions


138
0:12:56,88 --> 0:13:1,83
of evolution and has completely falsified
the fishy fishapod story, and


139
0:13:1,83 --> 0:13:6,68
simultaneously refuted the validity of both
geology and evolution theory, will the


140
0:13:6,68 --> 0:13:13,0
anti-creationists to whom this is explained
be convinced? Alas, probably not. But at


141
0:13:13,0 --> 0:13:17,19
least you'll know you gave it a good try.
As I mentioned previously, and as you can


142
0:13:17,19 --> 0:13:23,0
see here today, the evolution myth will
conform to whatever evidence you give it.


143
0:13:23,0 --> 0:13:29,25
Therefore evolution is not falsifiable,
therefore, it is not science. It is, as the


144
0:13:29,25 --> 0:13:35,49
Apostle Paul wrote: "'science,' falsely so
called." Evolution is a myth.


145
0:13:35,49 --> 0:13:41,1
[Scary, dramatic music]


146
0:13:41,1 --> 0:13:45,0
Wahoo! Mail for me?


147
0:13:45,0 --> 0:13:49,81
(beeping timer sound)


148
0:13:49,81 --> 0:13:55,56
Hmmmm...I forget - am I supposed to cut
the blue wire, or the red wire?


149
0:13:55,56 --> 0:13:58,85
Or, maybe I'll just pull the detonator!


150
0:13:58,85 --> 0:14:1,79
[Scary, dramatic music]


151
0:14:1,79 --> 0:14:5,44
I was SOOOo excited about Darwin's
birthday last weekend that I accidentally


152
0:14:5,44 --> 0:14:9,27
got my dates mixed up and celebrated his
birthday a day early. His birthday was


153
0:14:9,27 --> 0:14:12,98
Sunday, not Saturday as I said in last
week's show.  Well done to those who


154
0:14:12,98 --> 0:14:16,0
caught this mistake and somehow think
its discredits me when I get my days


155
0:14:16,0 --> 0:14:20,66
mixed up.  Hey - at least I'm not off by 20
million years.


156
0:14:20,66 --> 0:14:25,32
I'd like to give a special shout out to
callingheyzeus who was sharing his


157
0:14:25,32 --> 0:14:29,43
testimony in the comments last week -
kudos. It takes courage to share like that,


158
0:14:29,43 --> 0:14:33,93
and also to youtuber pumpstations for
sharing their story. I commend you both


159
0:14:33,93 --> 0:14:37,73
for your courage, and I'm sorry you had
to put up with the typical youtube trolls


160
0:14:37,73 --> 0:14:49,2
who selfishly butt in with incredible
insensitivity.


161
0:14:49,2 --> 0:14:51,87
Let me see what I can do - there is
copyright issues involved. I'm allowed to


162
0:14:51,87 --> 0:14:55,94
post it in some forms due to fair use, but I
would definitely need permission to post


163
0:14:55,94 --> 0:14:59,85
the whole article.  I also apologize for the
delay in getting the newsletter out, I


164
0:14:59,85 --> 0:15:3,1
wanted to add some more of the original
photos, and I only got permission to


165
0:15:3,1 --> 0:15:46,7
reproduce them a couple of days ago.


166
0:15:46,7 --> 0:15:51,57
Actually - I agree, don't take my word for
anything - do your own research. In fact,


167
0:15:51,57 --> 0:15:56,7
research the claims of what others like
BandofAtheist say, so you can see where


168
0:15:56,7 --> 0:15:59,47
they are lying and misleading people.  I'm
ready, willing and able to back up my


169
0:15:59,47 --> 0:16:4,78
commentary, you can verify the facts for
yourself! by the way - if you're going to use


170
0:16:4,78 --> 0:16:54,96
the internet: trueorigin.org, creationwiki.org,
great resources for further research.


171
0:16:54,96 --> 0:17:2,42
Uhhh. I have never, ever claimed to be a
professor - ever. Now some people call


172
0:17:2,42 --> 0:17:7,38
me by the nicknames of professor Juby,
Doctor Juby and Doc Juby. Nicknames


173
0:17:7,38 --> 0:17:10,91
that were given to me by another teacher
at the high school I taught at 17 years


174
0:17:10,91 --> 0:17:15,74
ago!  Students from that school, friends
and even the Vice Principal still call me


175
0:17:15,74 --> 0:17:20,8
Doc Juby! Sorry, but someone else giving
me an affectionate or respectful nickname


176
0:17:20,8 --> 0:17:48,24
does not make me a liar. 


177
0:17:48,24 --> 0:18:2,59
Thank you for the clarification.  If you'll
recall however, as Dr. Criswell explained:


178
0:18:2,59 --> 0:18:5,32
so the point remains the same.


179
0:18:5,32 --> 0:18:9,41
The comments always take fascinating
rabbit trails, as this week several


180
0:18:9,41 --> 0:18:15,29
youtubers got to debating genetics:
TCchapman500 quoted and responded to


181
0:18:15,29 --> 0:19:35,35
TheScienceFoundation:


182
0:19:35,35 --> 0:19:40,17
And as I point out in my "Natural
selection" rant - natural selection doesn't


183
0:19:40,17 --> 0:19:42,49
work the way evolution needs it to!


184
0:19:42,49 --> 0:19:48,24
I've decided to leave ratings turned on for
the whining anti-creationists.  I discovered


185
0:19:48,24 --> 0:19:54,99
that much to their dismay, ratings really
do not affect the viewership....at all......  So


186
0:19:54,99 --> 0:20:0,69
there you go! Rate and rant away!  Thanks
to all who gave input on that matter.


187
0:20:0,69 --> 0:20:5,47
That's enough for this week, I'm your host
Ian Juby, I hope you'll join me next


188
0:20:5,47 --> 0:20:9,27
Thursday for the next episode of Genesis
Week, and hopefully I'll finally get caught


189
0:20:9,27 --> 0:20:12,91
up and get some more videos out here
shortly. So make sure you subscribe up


190
0:20:12,91 --> 0:20:17,84
above.  Remember those famous words of
warning by the Lord Jesus Christ: I am


191
0:20:17,84 --> 0:20:22,74
the Way the Truth and THE LIFE, no man
comes to the father but through me."

193
0:20:26,9 --> 0:20:31,5
Genesis Week by the Big Valley Creation
Science Museum, located just 25 minutes


194
0:20:31,5 --> 0:20:35,26
north of Drumheller, Alberta. In the heart
of the dinosaur badlands, the Big Valley


195
0:20:35,26 --> 0:20:38,99
Creation Science Museum was built from
the ground up to give credit to our


196
0:20:38,99 --> 0:20:43,88
Creator, portraying the scientific evidence
showing that creation is the faith that fits


197
0:20:43,88 --> 0:20:48,24
the facts, and that evolution is the faith
that the facts have failed.
