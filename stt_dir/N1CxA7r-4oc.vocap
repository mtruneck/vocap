###2 About two or three times a century, a massive in our galaxy explodes. The star's core may
###8 survive as a neutron star or a black hole, but the rest of it rushes into space as swiftly
###14 expanding debris behind a powerful shockwave. As the supernova remnant grows, it sweeps
###20 up interstellar gas and gradually decelerates. Yet even thousands of years later, its imprint
###26 on the galaxy remains impressive.
###29 Exploding stars and their remnants have long been suspected of producing cosmic rays, some
###33 of the fastest matter in the universe. Where and how these protons, electrons and atomic
###39 nuclei are boosted to such high speeds has been an enduring mystery. Now, observations
###45 of two supernova remnants by NASA's Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope provide new insights.
###51 Because cosmic rays carry electric charge, their direction changes as they travel through
###55 magnetic fields.
###57 By the time the particles reach us, their paths are completely scrambled. We can't trace
###61 them back to their sources. So scientists must locate their origins by indirect means,
###66 which is where Fermi comes in. The interaction of high-energy particles with light and ordinary
###71 matter can produce gamma rays, the most powerful form of light. Unlike cosmic rays, gamma rays
###76 travel to us straight from their sources. In 1949, physicist Enrico Fermi worked out
###84 what he called "magnetized clouds" could accelerate cosmic rays. Later studies showed that a variant
###90 of his method, called Fermi acceleration worked especially well in supernova remnants.
###96 Confined by a magnetic field, high-energy particles move around randomly. Sometimes
###101 they cross the shock wave. With each round trip, they gain about 1 percent of their original
###106 energy. After dozens to hundreds of crossings, the particle is moving near the speed of light
###111 and is finally able to escape. If the supernova remnant resides near a dense molecular cloud,
###117 some of those escaping cosmic rays may strike the gas, and produce gamma rays.
###123 But electrons and protons make gamma rays in different ways. Cosmic ray electrons do
###128 so when they're deflected by passing near the nucleus of an atom. Accelerated protons
###135 may collide with an ordinary proton and produce a short-lived particle called a neutral pion.
###140 These pions quickly decay into a pair of gamma rays. At their brightest, both types of emission
###146 look very similar. Only with sensitive measurements at lower gamma-ray energies can scientists
###152 determine which process is responsible.
###154 Now, Fermi observations have done just that. They conclusively show these supernova remnants
###161 are accelerating protons. When they strike protons in nearby molecular clouds, they produce
###166 pions... and ultimately the gamma-ray emission Fermi sees. NASA's Fermi has detected gamma
###172 rays from many more supernova remnants, but the jury is still out on whether accelerated
###177 protons are always responsible and what their maximum energies may be. Nevertheless, the
###181 Fermi team has taken a major step--a century after the discovery of cosmic rays-- in establishing
###187 just where they arise. Something that would satisfy, but certainly not surprise, the original
###194 Fermi.
