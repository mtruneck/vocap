1
0:0:0,19 --> 0:0:3,157
(wind howling, hoof splashes puddle)


2
0:0:3,157 --> 0:0:9,184
(wind howling)


3
0:0:9,184 --> 0:0:11,273
(door opens and shuts)


4
0:0:11,273 --> 0:0:19,93
(objects clattering to floor)


5
0:0:19,93 --> 0:0:22,609
Shopkeep: May I help you, traveler?


6
0:0:22,609 --> 0:0:27,357
Hmm, something drew you to my shop.


7
0:0:27,357 --> 0:0:32,41
Something powerful.


8
0:0:32,41 --> 0:0:34,823
Ah, you have a keen eye.


9
0:0:34,823 --> 0:0:42,74
The Alicorn Amulet is one of the most mysterious
and powerful of all the known magical charms.


10
0:0:42,74 --> 0:0:47,24
(stuttering) Uh, I'm-I'm afraid this is...
(gravely) far too dangerous.


11
0:0:47,24 --> 0:0:49,41
(bag of bits clatters onto counter)


12
0:0:49,41 --> 0:0:51,541
(genially) Would you like that gift-wrapped?


13
0:0:51,541 --> 0:0:57,975
(foreboding musical sting)


14
0:0:57,975 --> 0:1:4,742
(theme song begins) My Little Pony, My Little Pony, ah, ah, ah, ah,


15
0:1:4,742 --> 0:1:9,107
(My Little Pony) Twilight: I used to wonder what friendship could be


16
0:1:9,107 --> 0:1:13,365
(My Little Pony) Until you all shared its magic with me


17
0:1:13,365 --> 0:1:15,408
Rainbow Dash: Big adventure
Pinkie Pie: Tons of fun


18
0:1:15,408 --> 0:1:17,735
Rarity: A beautiful heart
Applejack: Faithful and strong


19
0:1:17,735 --> 0:1:19,624
Fluttershy: Sharing kindness
Twilight: It's an easy feat


20
0:1:19,624 --> 0:1:21,992
All: And magic makes it all complete, yeah


21
0:1:21,992 --> 0:1:35,834
(My Little Pony) Do you know, you're all my very best friends


22
0:1:35,834 --> 0:1:37,694
Fluttershy: (gently) Don't be scared, little friends.


23
0:1:37,694 --> 0:1:39,958
Twilight is wonderful with magic!


24
0:1:39,958 --> 0:1:44,526
(threatening) ANYTHING happens to them, Twilight,
so help me...


25
0:1:44,526 --> 0:1:46,759
Spike: Aw, don't worry, Fluttershy.


26
0:1:46,759 --> 0:1:50,325
Twilight's magic has gotten a lot better since
she accidentally crushed me and Applejack


27
0:1:50,325 --> 0:1:51,643
with a giant snowball.


28
0:1:51,643 --> 0:1:54,66
Fluttershy: Of COURSE she's good with magic.


29
0:1:54,66 --> 0:1:55,959
Twilight's GREAT with magic.


30
0:1:55,959 --> 0:1:58,593
I guess I just don't want my little friends to be scared.


31
0:1:58,593 --> 0:2:0,926
(whimpering) Oh, oh, look how scared they are!


32
0:2:0,926 --> 0:2:3,109
(animals making noises genially)


33
0:2:3,109 --> 0:2:6,143
Twilight: I promise, Fluttershy.
Nothing bad will happen to them.


34
0:2:6,143 --> 0:2:9,31
Fluttershy: (agitated, teeth chattering, muffled)
I KNOW!


35
0:2:9,31 --> 0:2:12,851
(magical humming)


36
0:2:12,851 --> 0:2:17,321
Fluttershy: STOP! STOP! I can't take it!


37
0:2:17,321 --> 0:2:22,426
(animals cheering)


38
0:2:22,426 --> 0:2:23,349
(Fluttershy biting hooves)


39
0:2:23,349 --> 0:2:29,111
(animals chittering)


40
0:2:29,111 --> 0:2:32,752
Spike: Twilight, that looks amazing!


41
0:2:32,752 --> 0:2:36,386
Twilight: Phew!
(animals chittering)


42
0:2:36,386 --> 0:2:37,442
That's all for now, little ones.


43
0:2:37,442 --> 0:2:41,376
Maybe we can practice again later,
if Fluttershy says it's all right.


44
0:2:41,376 --> 0:2:43,863
(animals chittering)


45
0:2:43,863 --> 0:2:46,377
Spike: Your magic has really improved since
we came to Ponyville, Twilight.


46
0:2:46,377 --> 0:2:49,61
Spike: Princess Celestia's gonna love it!
Twilight: Thanks, Spike.


47
0:2:49,61 --> 0:2:52,66
I have to be at my best when she arrives with
the delegates from Saddle Arabia [Saudi Arabia].


48
0:2:52,66 --> 0:2:55,444
I can't believe she's trusting me with the entertainment-


49
0:2:55,444 --> 0:2:56,778
(Twilight and Rainbow Dash crash into ground)


50
0:2:56,778 --> 0:3:2,886
Rainbow Dash: (frantic) Twilight! Come quick!
It's an emergency!


51
0:3:2,886 --> 0:3:5,23
(magical poofing)


52
0:3:5,23 --> 0:3:10,501
Rarity: (shrieks) You BEAST! This shade of brown
should ONLY be used for accents!


53
0:3:10,501 --> 0:3:15,527
Pinkie Pie: C'mon, Applejack. We've got to get
her into a nice, soothing pink, STAT!


54
0:3:15,527 --> 0:3:17,36
Twilight: What's going on here?


55
0:3:17,36 --> 0:3:22,405
Trixie: Well, well, well, if it isn't...
Twilight Sparkle.


56
0:3:22,405 --> 0:3:25,411
Twilight: (gasps) Trixie...


57
0:3:25,411 --> 0:3:26,828
Spike: What's SHE doin' here?


58
0:3:26,828 --> 0:3:29,527
Rainbow Dash: You call THAT "great and powerful?"


59
0:3:29,527 --> 0:3:32,545
(magical poof)


60
0:3:32,545 --> 0:3:38,662
(Rainbow Dash yelps, big wing blasts wind)
Snips: Whoa, she's Rainbow Wobble now!


61
0:3:38,662 --> 0:3:40,53
(Rainbow Dash yelping)
Snails: Yeah! (laughs goofily)


62
0:3:40,53 --> 0:3:46,644
(Rainbow Dash's big wing beats past)
Great spell, O Great and Powerful Trixie!


63
0:3:46,644 --> 0:3:50,104
Trixie: You two, quiet. (magical poof)


64
0:3:50,104 --> 0:3:52,52
Snips: (dazed) H-hey! What happened?!


65
0:3:52,52 --> 0:3:54,351
Snails: GET OFF OF ME!


66
0:3:54,351 --> 0:4:0,195
(overlapping, panicked arguing)


67
0:4:0,195 --> 0:4:3,362
Twilight: Stop picking on my friends, Trixie.


68
0:4:3,362 --> 0:4:8,611
Trixie: You and I have some unfinished business.
My magic's gotten better since I was here last.


69
0:4:8,611 --> 0:4:13,396
And I'm gonna prove it.
Me and you, a magic duel.


70
0:4:13,396 --> 0:4:18,211
Winner stays, loser leaves Ponyville...FOREVER.


71
0:4:18,211 --> 0:4:21,413
Twilight: Forget it! I'd NEVER make a deal like that!


72
0:4:21,413 --> 0:4:23,528
Trixie: Hmph, your choice.


73
0:4:23,528 --> 0:4:28,945
(Spike yelping)


74
0:4:28,945 --> 0:4:31,867
(Spike bouncing on ground)
Twilight: (losing patience) Trixie, put him down.


75
0:4:31,867 --> 0:4:34,879
(Spike rolling on basket's rim)


76
0:4:34,879 --> 0:4:36,479
Twilight: Why are you doing this?!


77
0:4:36,479 --> 0:4:40,278
Trixie: Why?! Because you HUMILIATED ME!


78
0:4:40,278 --> 0:4:44,228
After you showed me up with that Ursa Minor,


79
0:4:44,228 --> 0:4:47,396
I became a laughingstock!


80
0:4:47,396 --> 0:4:50,534
Everywhere I went, I was laughed at and ostracized!


81
0:4:50,534 --> 0:4:55,696
I even had to take a job on a rock farm
just to earn a living.


82
0:4:55,696 --> 0:4:58,199
A ROCK FARM!


83
0:4:58,199 --> 0:5:2,164
Pinkie Pie: (scoffs) You're LUCKY a rock farm
would take the likes of YOU!


84
0:5:2,164 --> 0:5:9,172
(magical poof, trash can lid clanking)


85
0:5:9,172 --> 0:5:11,31
Trixie: Now I want revenge.


86
0:5:11,31 --> 0:5:14,312
And I'll just keep casting spells
'til you agree.


87
0:5:14,312 --> 0:5:20,115
(library uproots, books start flying out)


88
0:5:20,115 --> 0:5:22,146
Trixie: Well, what do you say?


89
0:5:22,146 --> 0:5:26,282
(ponies voicing discontent)


90
0:5:26,282 --> 0:5:29,197
Twilight: ...All right, Trixie.
Let's duel.


91
0:5:29,197 --> 0:5:33,281
Trixie: Excellent.
(library crashes into ground)


92
0:5:33,281 --> 0:5:36,626
(poof)


93
0:5:36,626 --> 0:5:38,886
(Pinkie muttering unintelligibly)


94
0:5:38,886 --> 0:5:42,283
Trixie: If I lose, I won't set hoof in Ponyville again.


95
0:5:42,283 --> 0:5:46,831
But if YOU lose, YOU'RE the one banished
from this one-horse town.


96
0:5:46,831 --> 0:5:49,38
(others gasping, Pinkie muttering unintelligibly)


97
0:5:49,38 --> 0:5:57,28
(foreboding background music)


98
0:5:57,28 --> 0:6:0,148
Trixie: DRAW! (poof)


99
0:6:0,148 --> 0:6:2,1
(ponies gasping)


100
0:6:2,1 --> 0:6:3,48
(Shoeshine Wilhelm screams)


101
0:6:3,48 --> 0:6:7,564
(Twilight grunts, cart and apples land gently)


102
0:6:7,564 --> 0:6:12,664
Twilight: Phew... (gasps)


103
0:6:12,664 --> 0:6:14,325
(poof)


104
0:6:14,325 --> 0:6:17,852
(parasprite swallows pies messily,
then hacks up another parasprite)


105
0:6:17,852 --> 0:6:21,147
(poof)


106
0:6:21,147 --> 0:6:27,607
(snow thuds heavily onto ground)


107
0:6:27,607 --> 0:6:32,52
(poof)


108
0:6:32,52 --> 0:6:35,466
(ponies laughing)


109
0:6:35,466 --> 0:6:37,304
(scissors snipping)


110
0:6:37,304 --> 0:6:40,175
Trixie: (crossly) Snips, Snails, step forward.


111
0:6:40,175 --> 0:6:44,649
Snips: (apprehensively) Wh-what is it,
O Great and Powerful Trixie?


112
0:6:44,649 --> 0:6:48,712
(high-pitched humming)


113
0:6:48,712 --> 0:6:50,878
(poof)


114
0:6:50,878 --> 0:6:55,109
(baby Snips wailing)


115
0:6:55,109 --> 0:6:59,202
Twilight: An age spell...?
But how could you do an age spell?!


116
0:6:59,202 --> 0:7:1,467
That's only for the highest-level unicorns!


117
0:7:1,467 --> 0:7:4,675
Trixie: (rubs Amulet, snidely) Well, Twilight? Give up?


118
0:7:4,675 --> 0:7:7,135
(Twilight sighs, then grunts with exertion)


119
0:7:7,135 --> 0:7:13,118
(high-pitched humming)
Spike: Come on, Twilight...! You can do it!


120
0:7:13,118 --> 0:7:20,92
(humming distorts and fades out)


121
0:7:20,92 --> 0:7:25,269
(Snips and Snails land on ground;
Snips wails, Snails' back cracks)


122
0:7:25,269 --> 0:7:31,784
Trixie: Trixie IS the highest-level unicorn!
(nefarious laugh)


123
0:7:31,784 --> 0:7:35,777
And now it's time for you to LEAVE PONYVILLE.


124
0:7:35,777 --> 0:7:37,569
(imitating Pinkie Pie) FOREVER!


125
0:7:37,569 --> 0:7:40,689
Applejack: That's ENOUGH, Trixie!


126
0:7:40,689 --> 0:7:44,844
Rarity: You proved your point,
but you can't possibly expect Twilight to leave Ponyville.


127
0:7:44,844 --> 0:7:48,93
Trixie: You fools. She's already gone.


128
0:7:48,93 --> 0:7:50,952
(Twilight screams)


129
0:7:50,952 --> 0:7:54,201
(Twilight crashes into ground repeatedly)


130
0:7:54,201 --> 0:7:58,451
(poof)


131
0:7:58,451 --> 0:8:3,914
(glass bowl lands heavily on ground)


132
0:8:3,914 --> 0:8:6,469
Twilight: It's okay, guys. I'll figure something out.


133
0:8:6,469 --> 0:8:10,202
Just...take care of each other.
And keep an eye on Trixie.


134
0:8:10,202 --> 0:8:13,871
There's something strange about her.


135
0:8:13,871 --> 0:8:20,838
Spike: Twilight...?


136
0:8:20,838 --> 0:8:28,675
(Twilight grunting)


137
0:8:28,675 --> 0:8:29,719
(Twilight groans in frustration)


138
0:8:29,719 --> 0:8:33,301
Twilight: It's impossible. How could Trixie
know such advanced magic?!


139
0:8:33,301 --> 0:8:37,961
Without Spike, I can't get a message
to the princess in Saddle Arabia.


140
0:8:37,961 --> 0:8:40,488
So, who else do I know who understands
strange and powerful magic?


141
0:8:40,488 --> 0:8:44,47
(Zecora's "theme" plays in background)


142
0:8:44,47 --> 0:8:47,97
Zecora: (metric) Your tale of woe
upsets me so.


143
0:8:47,97 --> 0:8:51,587
No wonder you're dour.
It's an abusive power!


144
0:8:51,587 --> 0:8:55,705
Twilight: I don't know what to do, Zecora.
I feel like I've abandoned my friends.


145
0:8:55,705 --> 0:8:57,736
But I can't take her on horn-to-horn.


146
0:8:57,736 --> 0:9:1,252
Zecora: (sips tea) If you train with me,
so good you'll be,


147
0:9:1,252 --> 0:9:4,87
I'll show you the way
to make sure she won't stay.


148
0:9:4,87 --> 0:9:8,604
Twilight: YOU'LL train me in magic?
But she was doing age spells,


149
0:9:8,604 --> 0:9:10,654
weather spells, you name it- (knocks over cup)


150
0:9:10,654 --> 0:9:16,597
Zecora: When it comes to magic, it would be tragic
if somepony licks me, especially Trixie.


151
0:9:16,597 --> 0:9:18,429
Twilight: You really think I can beat her?


152
0:9:18,429 --> 0:9:19,721
Zecora: Mm-hmm.


153
0:9:19,721 --> 0:9:27,211
Twilight: (knocks over cup) Okay!
When do we start?!


154
0:9:27,211 --> 0:9:29,773
Trixie: You two! Hurry up with my throne!


155
0:9:29,773 --> 0:9:34,371
(Applejack squashes apple)
And YOU. How long do I have to wait


156
0:9:34,371 --> 0:9:36,239
for my applesauce facial?! [Ed. note: ewww]


157
0:9:36,239 --> 0:9:40,473
Applejack: Forget it, Trixie. I ain't doin' nothin'
'til you let Twilight come home.


158
0:9:40,473 --> 0:9:42,988
(poof)


159
0:9:42,988 --> 0:9:48,536
(Applejack laughing and gasping for air)
O-okay, I'll do it! Just make it stop!


160
0:9:48,536 --> 0:9:51,989
(crash)


161
0:9:51,989 --> 0:10:0,349
Trixie: I thought I told you to DANCE!


162
0:10:0,349 --> 0:10:4,522
Rarity: (sighs) Trixie's cruel magic
is ruining Ponyville- (pricks self with needle) OW!


163
0:10:4,522 --> 0:10:16,351
(sniveling) Oh, somepony has to help us!


164
0:10:16,351 --> 0:10:24,739
Zecora: Ah, no noise, no sound, no din, no fuss
must interfere with your focus.


165
0:10:24,739 --> 0:10:29,572
Unlearn what you have learned.
Only then can victory be earned.


166
0:10:29,572 --> 0:10:34,679
(Twilight moans)
Trixie: (voice-over in Twilight's head)
Trixie IS the highest-level unicorn!


167
0:10:34,679 --> 0:10:40,28
(Trixie's laugh echoing)
(Twilight yelps and splashes into water)


168
0:10:40,28 --> 0:10:46,5
Zecora: There is much, much that I can teach,
but the answer you need may still be out of reach.


169
0:10:46,5 --> 0:10:52,88
Twilight: I'm sorry, Zecora. I'm trying my best, but...
I can't stop thinking about Trixie.


170
0:10:52,88 --> 0:10:56,273
There's something different about her.
It's like she's gone from high-and-mighty


171
0:10:56,273 --> 0:10:57,606
to mean and nasty.


172
0:10:57,606 --> 0:11:4,31
Zecora: Your thinking needs a readjust.
Total concentration is a must.


173
0:11:4,31 --> 0:11:16,329
(wind howling, banners flapping)


174
0:11:16,329 --> 0:11:19,506
Rarity: (scoffs) This really doesn't seem
to be getting us anywhere.


175
0:11:19,506 --> 0:11:23,947
(Pinkie mutters incoherently)


176
0:11:23,947 --> 0:11:28,491
Applejack: I hear ya, Pinkie. I can't find ANYTHING
that describes the kinda magic Trixie's doin'.


177
0:11:28,491 --> 0:11:30,324
Spike: (sighs) There must be SOMETHING.


178
0:11:30,324 --> 0:11:32,241
Twilight has every magic book there is.


179
0:11:32,241 --> 0:11:35,379
Fluttershy: (quietly) Um, I think I may have found something.


180
0:11:35,379 --> 0:11:40,346
Rarity: (melodramatic) Yes, it's time for us to consider
our futures in this new Trixie-led Ponyville.


181
0:11:40,346 --> 0:11:45,24
Fluttershy: Um, this sounds an awful lot like Trixie's magic-
Applejack: She wants me to grow apples with no peels!


182
0:11:45,24 --> 0:11:47,54
Now, how the hay am I supposed to do that?!


183
0:11:47,54 --> 0:11:52,123
Fluttershy: Um, there's a picture here of that necklace-
(Pinkie muttering unintelligibly)


184
0:11:52,123 --> 0:11:55,724
Fluttershy: It's called the "Alicorn Amulet," and
whoever wears it is blessed with untold-


185
0:11:55,724 --> 0:11:57,107
Spike: Hey, everypony! Look!


186
0:11:57,107 --> 0:11:59,757
This book has a picture of Trixie's necklace!


187
0:11:59,757 --> 0:12:4,224
It's called the "Alicorn Amulet," and
whoever wears it is blessed with untold powers!


188
0:12:4,224 --> 0:12:6,339
Fluttershy: I-if you read a little further, you'll see-


189
0:12:6,339 --> 0:12:10,807
Rarity: "Even though it provides great power,
it also corrupts the user!"


190
0:12:10,807 --> 0:12:14,887
Fluttershy: Yes, but, um, you can't-
Spike: You can't just take the Alicorn Amulet off her neck.


191
0:12:14,887 --> 0:12:18,557
It has a magical lock. Trixie's the only
pony who can take it off.


192
0:12:18,557 --> 0:12:21,391
Fluttershy: Maybe we should-
Applejack: We need to get this information to Twilight.


193
0:12:21,391 --> 0:12:23,807
Applejack: She'll know what to do.
Fluttershy: But, how-how...


194
0:12:23,807 --> 0:12:27,607
Rarity: If any of us try to leave,
Trixie's magical force field will tell her!


195
0:12:27,607 --> 0:12:29,491
Fluttershy: Maybe we should-
Rainbow Dash: I'VE GOT IT!


196
0:12:29,491 --> 0:12:32,826
Trying to sneak past the force field
would be impossible without help.


197
0:12:32,826 --> 0:12:36,359
But I know who's got the GOODS
to get into those WOODS.


198
0:12:36,359 --> 0:12:39,167
Fluttershy: It must be-
Rainbow Dash: FLUTTERSHY! (Fluttershy shrieks)


199
0:12:39,167 --> 0:12:42,807
Applejack: What do ya say, Fluttershy?
Can ya handle the mission?


200
0:12:42,807 --> 0:12:46,441
Fluttershy: NO! I'll crack under the pressure!
I'll snap like a twig!


201
0:12:46,441 --> 0:12:50,192
Rainbow Dash: Perfect! Fluttershy'll sneak
out of Ponyville and find Twilight.


202
0:12:50,192 --> 0:12:55,256
Fluttershy: (protesting) B-but I- (crashes into ground)


203
0:12:55,256 --> 0:12:58,442
(teeth chattering)


204
0:12:58,442 --> 0:13:0,209
Fluttershy: (sighs) Okay...


205
0:13:0,209 --> 0:13:2,943
(ponies cheering)


206
0:13:2,943 --> 0:13:7,373
Rarity: I know just the design for
a dangerous mission outfit!


207
0:13:7,373 --> 0:13:12,941
(Snips and Snails grunting and groaning)


208
0:13:12,941 --> 0:13:16,276
Trixie: PULL, you fools! (cracks whip)


209
0:13:16,276 --> 0:13:21,9
Somepony set off the magic force field,
and Trixie intends to punish them!


210
0:13:21,9 --> 0:13:25,308
Snips: But...wouldn't it be faster if we
had some...WHEELS?!


211
0:13:25,308 --> 0:13:29,327
Trixie: The Great and Powerful Trixie doesn't
trust wheels. Now, pull FASTER!


212
0:13:29,327 --> 0:13:34,92
Snails: (fearfully) I'm tellin' ya, Snips!
She's getting weirder and weirder! (whip cracks)


213
0:13:34,92 --> 0:13:38,773
(Snips and Snails resume grunting,
beaver tails impacting magic barrier)


214
0:13:38,773 --> 0:13:42,393
Trixie: Stop! You there, what are you doing!


215
0:13:42,393 --> 0:13:53,737
(beaver chattering angrily)


216
0:13:53,737 --> 0:13:55,171
(barrier crashes to ground)


217
0:13:55,171 --> 0:13:58,508
(poof)


218
0:13:58,508 --> 0:14:1,96
Snails: Why is she so MEAN to us?!


219
0:14:1,96 --> 0:14:6,276
Snips: Yeah! I miss the days when she was...
just a fraud!


220
0:14:6,276 --> 0:14:12,5
(whip cracks)


221
0:14:12,5 --> 0:14:16,423
(beaver chattering)


222
0:14:16,423 --> 0:14:16,994
(crash)


223
0:14:16,994 --> 0:14:21,444
Fluttershy: (stalling) O-oh dear! Rarity's
dangerous mission outfit is ruined!


224
0:14:21,444 --> 0:14:23,144
Guess we'd better go back! (nervous chuckle)


225
0:14:23,144 --> 0:14:27,66
(animals chattering)
Oh...okay, okay, you're right.


226
0:14:27,66 --> 0:14:32,11
Need to be brave and find Twilight.
(bird chirps) Oh! You found her?


227
0:14:32,11 --> 0:14:37,49
(bird chirps) And she's in the Everfree Forest?!


228
0:14:37,49 --> 0:14:40,211
Oh, this IS me being brave!


229
0:14:40,211 --> 0:14:45,261
I wanna be brave at home,
locked in my closet, with my TEDDY BEAR!


230
0:14:45,261 --> 0:14:50,611
(jungle drums)


231
0:14:50,611 --> 0:14:52,898
Twilight: I can't believe I didn't recognize
the Alicorn Amulet.


232
0:14:52,898 --> 0:14:56,24
Fluttershy: The more she uses it,
the more it will corrupt her.


233
0:14:56,24 --> 0:15:0,393
Twilight: But how am I supposed to beat that amulet?
My magic's not good enough.


234
0:15:0,393 --> 0:15:6,65
Zecora: Twilight Sparkle, much work have you done.
You've learned all of my lessons. All...but one.


235
0:15:6,65 --> 0:15:13,294
If Trixie's tricks have you in a fix,
you must mix your magic and use the Six.


236
0:15:13,294 --> 0:15:18,829
Twilight: (ruminating) "Mix your magic, use the Six..."
"Mix your magic, use the Six."


237
0:15:18,829 --> 0:15:20,544
(epiphany) "Use the Six," that's IT!


238
0:15:20,544 --> 0:15:22,244
Zecora, you're a genius!


239
0:15:22,244 --> 0:15:36,608
Now I need to get you back inside Ponyville, Fluttershy.


240
0:15:36,608 --> 0:15:40,31
(throne dragging on ground)
Trixie: This better not be another false alarm,


241
0:15:40,31 --> 0:15:43,26
or the Great and Powerful Trixie will- (gasps)


242
0:15:43,26 --> 0:15:47,645
(venomously) YOU. (echoing inside barrier)
What's the matter, Twilight Sparkle?


243
0:15:47,645 --> 0:15:49,33
Not enjoying your exile?


244
0:15:49,33 --> 0:15:52,529
Twilight: I know about the Alicorn Amulet.
I know you cheated.


245
0:15:52,529 --> 0:15:55,194
Trixie: "Cheated?" Moi?


246
0:15:55,194 --> 0:15:59,511
Twilight: Yeah, and I thought you might
wanna see what a REAL magical amulet looks like.


247
0:15:59,511 --> 0:16:2,878
Zecora gave it to me. It's from
beyond the Everfree Forest.


248
0:16:2,878 --> 0:16:6,442
And it's WAY more powerful than your measly
little Alicorn Amulet.


249
0:16:6,442 --> 0:16:10,448
Trixie: (false bravado) HAH! NOTHING'S more powerful
than the Alicorn Amulet.


250
0:16:10,448 --> 0:16:15,479
And NOPONY'S more powerful than the
Great and Powerful Trixie!


251
0:16:15,479 --> 0:16:18,296
Twilight: (unfazed) Care to put your amulet
where your mouth is?


252
0:16:18,296 --> 0:16:22,96
Twilight: How about another duel?
Trixie: Why should I? I already beat you.


253
0:16:22,96 --> 0:16:23,479
Twilight: That's up to you.


254
0:16:23,479 --> 0:16:28,473
(teasing) But I guess you'll never see the totally
awesome magic from beyond the Everfree Forest...


255
0:16:28,473 --> 0:16:30,62
C'mon, Zecora.


256
0:16:30,62 --> 0:16:32,513
Trixie: Wait!


257
0:16:32,513 --> 0:16:36,858
(barrier dissipates)


258
0:16:36,858 --> 0:16:38,12
Okay, okay, you're on.


259
0:16:38,12 --> 0:16:39,33
A second duel.


260
0:16:39,33 --> 0:16:45,345
(thunder rumbling)


261
0:16:45,345 --> 0:16:50,599
(peal of thunder)


262
0:16:50,599 --> 0:16:53,41
Trixie: Let's start with a simple age spell,
shall we?


263
0:16:53,41 --> 0:16:54,147
Twilight: Let's.


264
0:16:54,147 --> 0:16:57,504
Trixie: Snips, Snails!


265
0:16:57,504 --> 0:16:59,697
(poof)


266
0:16:59,697 --> 0:17:3,38
(Snips and Snails wailing)


267
0:17:3,38 --> 0:17:8,247
(haughty) An oldie, but a goodie. Now,
let's see what your little "charm" can do.


268
0:17:8,247 --> 0:17:12,479
Twilight: No problem. Um, Applejack, Rarity?


269
0:17:12,479 --> 0:17:14,29
Could you help me, please?


270
0:17:14,29 --> 0:17:25,102
Applejack: Huh...?
Rarity: Huh?


271
0:17:25,102 --> 0:17:31,766
(poof)


272
0:17:31,766 --> 0:17:36,164
Trixie: (feigning disinterest) Eh, ho-hum.
So you can do an age spell. Big deal.


273
0:17:36,164 --> 0:17:38,813
(poof)


274
0:17:38,813 --> 0:17:48,716
(repeated poofs)


275
0:17:48,716 --> 0:17:52,947
Trixie: (shocked) But...that's IMPOSSIBLE!


276
0:17:52,947 --> 0:17:56,889
Twilight: That's nothin'.


277
0:17:56,889 --> 0:18:2,827
(poof)


278
0:18:2,827 --> 0:18:4,931
Rainbow Dash: Yow!


279
0:18:4,931 --> 0:18:8,983
Trixie: How did you-?!
Twilight: Duplication spell.


280
0:18:8,983 --> 0:18:13,462
Ever seen one pony play
ten instruments?


281
0:18:13,462 --> 0:18:14,624
(poof)


282
0:18:14,624 --> 0:18:21,62
(Pinkie playing upbeat polka melody)


283
0:18:21,62 --> 0:18:23,731
Trixie: (incredulous) This...this can't be!


284
0:18:23,731 --> 0:18:29,374
Twilight: Ooh, one more! I can turn a mare...
into a stallion.


285
0:18:29,374 --> 0:18:33,416
(poof)
Applejack: (deeper, bashful voice) Eenope...


286
0:18:33,416 --> 0:18:36,455
(poof)


287
0:18:36,455 --> 0:18:42,131
Twilight: Well, Trixie, looks like my amulet
is more powerful than yours-HEY!


288
0:18:42,131 --> 0:18:43,281
Give it back!


289
0:18:43,281 --> 0:18:51,599
Trixie: (nefarious laughter) With this amulet,
I shall now rule ALL OF EQUESTRIA!


290
0:18:51,599 --> 0:18:53,532
(laughs nefariously)


291
0:18:53,532 --> 0:18:55,716
(amulet's magic fizzles out)


292
0:18:55,716 --> 0:19:5,277
Witness, my subjects! Gaze upon an ever-greater
and powerfuler TRIXIE! (peal of thunder)


293
0:19:5,277 --> 0:19:7,131
(Trixie laughs nefariously, but cuts out)


294
0:19:7,131 --> 0:19:11,906
Trixie: HEY! (scoffs) I don't need that
old Alicorn Amulet.


295
0:19:11,906 --> 0:19:13,774
I have THIS.


296
0:19:13,774 --> 0:19:16,625
(poof)


297
0:19:16,625 --> 0:19:23,31
Rainbow Dash: (laughing uncontrollably) Stop it!
That tickles!


298
0:19:23,31 --> 0:19:26,151
Trixie: (confused) "Tickles?!" Th-that was
supposed to make you writhe in agony!


299
0:19:26,151 --> 0:19:28,217
This amulet is defective.


300
0:19:28,217 --> 0:19:30,49
(zap) Give mine back.


301
0:19:30,49 --> 0:19:33,714
Rainbow Dash: Sorry. This is goin' back
into hiding, where it belongs.


302
0:19:33,714 --> 0:19:39,8
Twilight: By the way, Trixie? The amulet around your neck?
It's one of Zecora's doorstops.


303
0:19:39,8 --> 0:19:43,27
(bauble shatters)
Trixie: (cowed) But...how did you do those spells?


304
0:19:43,27 --> 0:19:45,127
Nopony can do those spells!


305
0:19:45,127 --> 0:19:47,615
Twilight: You're right, not even me.


306
0:19:47,615 --> 0:19:51,216
(voice-over) Zecora taught me so much about magic
while I was in exile.


307
0:19:51,216 --> 0:19:55,638
She even taught me when not to use it.


308
0:19:55,638 --> 0:19:59,566
My magic alone wasn't powerful enough to take on
the Alicorn Amulet head-to-head,


309
0:19:59,566 --> 0:20:3,134
so I needed to use a different kind of magic:


310
0:20:3,134 --> 0:20:5,485
the magic of friendship.


311
0:20:5,485 --> 0:20:9,816
I also knew that the only pony who could
get the amulet off your neck was you.


312
0:20:9,816 --> 0:20:13,416
Trixie: But...what about the pony
with the ten instruments?


313
0:20:13,416 --> 0:20:18,399
Twilight: That's not magic. That was just Pinkie Pie.
(Pinkie playing upbeat polka)


314
0:20:18,399 --> 0:20:30,717
(ponies cheering)


315
0:20:30,717 --> 0:20:39,816
(ponies "ooh" and "ahh")


316
0:20:39,816 --> 0:20:45,752
(fireworks)


317
0:20:45,752 --> 0:20:47,967
Twilight: Trixie...?


318
0:20:47,967 --> 0:20:50,151
Trixie: (remorsefully) It's the least I could do.


319
0:20:50,151 --> 0:20:54,547
I treated you and your friends so horribly
when I was wearing that Alicorn Amulet.


320
0:20:54,547 --> 0:20:56,847
I just couldn't control myself.


321
0:20:56,847 --> 0:21:2,804
You can forgive me, can't you?


322
0:21:2,804 --> 0:21:5,23
Twilight: Hmm...sure.


323
0:21:5,23 --> 0:21:10,513
Trixie: Oh, good. (usual tone) Don't you think
the Great and Apologetic Trixie


324
0:21:10,513 --> 0:21:15,865
is the most magnificent humble pony
you've ever seen?


325
0:21:15,865 --> 0:21:23,625
(poof, Trixie trips and falls)


326
0:21:23,625 --> 0:21:27,763
(Pinkie spreads iris wipe and mutters unintelligibly)


327
0:21:27,763 --> 0:21:30,897
(poofs, Pinkie gasps)


328
0:21:30,897 --> 0:21:35,84
(ending theme begins) My Little Pony


329
0:21:35,84 --> 0:21:40,731
[Thanks for watching my captions again this week.]


330
0:21:40,731 --> 0:21:45,806
[Season three has been a blast so far,
and I'm rather enjoying captioning the episodes.]


331
0:21:45,806 --> 0:21:50,357
[Remember, if you have any suggestions for what
I could do better, drop a PM by BeanyOne!]


332
0:21:50,357 --> 0:23:50,357
[See you next week. Same pony time, same pony channel.]
