3
0:0:10,71 --> 0:0:12,2
general strike began.


4
0:0:12,2 --> 0:0:14,54
Someone said about a million
people were turning up.


5
0:0:14,54 --> 0:0:16,58
Further emboldening the strikers
was the presence of a


6
0:0:16,58 --> 0:0:18,61
lot of stray dogs marching
in support.


7
0:0:18,61 --> 0:0:22,258

10
0:0:40,34 --> 0:0:43,7
NARRATOR: They started early,
with crowds meeting around the


11
0:0:43,7 --> 0:0:46,8
city at 10:30 and slowly
converging on Syntagma Square.


12
0:0:46,8 --> 0:0:48,991
The vibes were good, unified
and peaceful.

NARRATOR: Thanks to the guys
protecting Parliament, there


18
0:1:13,3 --> 0:1:15,37
was nothing for the crowd to
do but pick a fight with a


19
0:1:15,37 --> 0:1:16,421
cageful of riot police.

[SHOUTING]


21
0:1:20,349 --> 0:1:49,22



22
0:1:49,22 --> 0:1:52,2
That was the first and mildest
tear-gassing of the day.


23
0:1:52,2 --> 0:1:55,4
By the way, that stuff they're
dousing themselves in is


24
0:1:55,4 --> 0:1:56,5
called Maalox.


25
0:1:56,5 --> 0:1:57,64
It's supposed to counteract
the gas.

31
0:2:52,4 --> 0:2:53,677
NARRATOR: Back outside
Parliament, it


32
0:2:53,677 --> 0:2:54,9
was all kicking off.


33
0:2:54,9 --> 0:2:57,12
We kept venturing into the
Square, only to get gassed


34
0:2:57,12 --> 0:2:59,8
with the rest of the crowd.

45
0:5:20,55 --> 0:5:23,27
NARRATOR: By 5 o'clock, after
more than four hours of


46
0:5:23,27 --> 0:5:25,78
running battles around
Parliament, the people started


47
0:5:25,78 --> 0:5:27,5
to disperse.


48
0:5:27,5 --> 0:5:28,91
We might have felt like the
world was ending, but


49
0:5:28,91 --> 0:5:30,75
according to the conversations
around us, the


50
0:5:30,75 --> 0:5:32,13
day had been tame.


51
0:5:32,13 --> 0:5:33,75
Everyone was saving themselves
for day two.
