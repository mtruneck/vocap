###9 Violent winds, driving rain, killer waves.
###15 These are the hallmarks of a hurricane,
###18 Also called cyclons or typhoons, hurricanes are giant storms
###23 prowling the world's tropical seas.
###25 An average hurricane releases as much energy in a day
###29 as the explosion of half a million small atomic bombs.
###34 Hurricanes form in the summer and fall,
###36 when the sun heats vast stretches of tropical ocean to over 82 degrees.
###42 Warm moist air rises over these hot spots, creating thunderstorms.
###47 Upper level winds and surface winds then come together,
###51 forming a circular pattern of clouds, known as a tropical depression.
###56 When the winds exceed thirty-nine miles per hour, a tropical storm is developed.
###62 When the winds reach 74 miles per hour, a hurricane is officially born.
###68 Inside the storm bands of rain up to three hundred miles long
###72 meet in the eye wall, the most violent section.
###75 Here winds of up to two hundred miles per hour spiral upward.
###80 Within the centre of the hurricane, down droughts of dry air
###84 create a strangely calm area called 'the eye'.
###88 Fully formed, a hurricane may stretch over five hundred miles in diameter
###94 (that's a storm nearly the size of Texas)
###97 and reach a height of nine miles,
###100 Most of these storms being out over the open sea,
###104 but in an average year, two or three will strike the mainland of North America.
###108 And when they do the damage can be catastrophic.
###112 Most dangerous is the storm surge,
###115 a wall of water that sweeps across the coastline
###119 where the hurricane makes landfall.
###122 About forty-five thousand people were killed by hurricanes in the 20th century,
###127 including some fifteen thousand in the U.S.
###131 Hurricanes are also costly in dollars.
###134 1992's hurricane Andrew was the most expensive natural disaster in U.S. history,
###140 causing more than twenty-five billion dollars worth of damage.
###145 Scientists are searching for better ways to predict the path of a hurricane.
###151 Special planes called hurricane hunters fly directly into these monster storms
###156 and drop sensors to measure wind speed, temperature and air pressure,
###161 providing vital clues to the hurricane's direction.
###166 New 3D models are also helping scientists understand
###170 this awesome force of Nature
###172 and provide quicker and more accurate warnings
###175 to anyone unlucky enough to be caught in its path.
