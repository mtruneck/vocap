1
0:0:0,2 --> 0:0:2,4
Inca built palaces, storehouses and castles in the tall mountains.


2
0:0:2,4 --> 0:0:4,59
In their realm of six million people


3
0:0:4,59 --> 0:0:10,73
they rely on manpower to transport stones without animals or the wheel.


4
0:0:10,73 --> 0:0:18,57
And the energy for that is provided by another amazing food source.


5
0:0:18,57 --> 0:0:30,199
They are famed for their gold, but their true treasure is less glamorous.


6
0:0:30,199 --> 0:0:34,96
A tuber, native to the Americas and unknown in Europe,


7
0:0:34,96 --> 0:0:40,21
cultivated here some eight thousand years ago in the region around lake Titicaca,


8
0:0:40,21 --> 0:0:42,52
in today's Peru and Bolivia,


9
0:0:42,52 --> 0:0:46,35
twelve thousand five hundred feet up.


10
0:0:46,35 --> 0:0:57,12
What his now a staple food in Europe was an American invention.


11
0:0:57,12 --> 0:0:59,47
By the year 1491


12
0:0:59,47 --> 0:1:2,22
the Inca grow thousands of varieties,


13
0:1:2,22 --> 0:1:5,58
domesticated from wild ancestors.


14
0:1:5,58 --> 0:1:8,5
Some poisonous,


15
0:1:8,5 --> 0:1:17,96
some even carnivorous.


16
0:1:17,96 --> 0:1:22,98
They preserve the tuber by meshing them into a substance called "chuño".


17
0:1:22,98 --> 0:1:28,0
After harvest potatoes are spread on straw and left out to freeze at night.


18
0:1:28,0 --> 0:1:31,511
During the day they are exposed to the sun.


19
0:1:31,511 --> 0:1:35,2
Trampling them eliminates water and allows them to dry.


20
0:1:35,2 --> 0:1:45,12
Chuño can be stored for ten years providing excellent insurance against possible crop failures.


21
0:1:45,12 --> 0:1:48,15
The inca carved step-like terraces into the mountainsides,


22
0:1:48,15 --> 0:1:53,8
to stop the soil eroding and create a flat surface for their crops.


23
0:1:53,8 --> 0:1:57,514
Terraces absorb more sunlight than steep slopes


24
0:1:57,514 --> 0:2:10,189
so potatoes can grow at the highest altitudes.


25
0:2:10,189 --> 0:2:14,599
And all this is achieved by manpower alone.


26
0:2:14,599 --> 0:2:25,399
Using wooden tools.


27
0:2:25,399 --> 0:2:36,819
In North- and South-America in 1491 farmers grow corn and potatoes to feed their people.


28
0:2:36,819 --> 0:2:42,979
They have none of the domesticated animals that benefit Europe.


29
0:2:42,979 --> 0:2:45,4
For Inca farmers in the Andes


30
0:2:45,4 --> 0:2:50,349
their chief source of meat and transporting goods is the lama.


31
0:2:50,349 --> 0:2:56,199
This is the biggest domestic mammal in the Americas.


32
0:2:56,199 --> 0:3:4,379
The lamas also offered dung for the soil and hides for clothes,


33
0:3:4,379 --> 0:3:7,529
but they can't milk or ride them.


34
0:3:7,529 --> 0:3:16,609
And the animals can't pull a plough so they are no good for farming or for travel.


35
0:3:16,609 --> 0:3:28,95
But their wool is a true blessing.


36
0:3:28,95 --> 0:3:33,369
It is warmer and lighter than sheep's wool.


37
0:3:33,369 --> 0:3:44,129
And produces a greater yield.


38
0:3:44,129 --> 0:3:49,329
The second principal domesticated animal of the Americas is much smaller.


39
0:3:49,329 --> 0:3:53,289
For the Aztecs turkey is vital.


40
0:3:53,289 --> 0:3:57,569
Even today for their descendants in Mexico and Guatemala the turkey is so important


41
0:3:57,569 --> 0:4:8,69
that they dedicate two religious festivals to it.


42
0:4:8,69 --> 0:4:12,69
Native Americans have such few domesticated animals


43
0:4:12,69 --> 0:4:22,399
because the biggest native mammals in the Americas died out long ago.


44
0:4:22,399 --> 0:4:27,539
At the end of the last ice age the megafauna in the Americas, the giant bison and the mastodonts


45
0:4:27,539 --> 0:4:29,7
went extinct.


46
0:4:29,7 --> 0:4:31,699
The reasons for that probably twofold.


47
0:4:31,699 --> 0:4:35,699
First of all as the ice age was ending, the climate came much hotter and drier,


48
0:4:35,699 --> 0:4:39,229
and this killed the vegetation that these original animals depended on.


49
0:4:39,229 --> 0:4:46,419
Secondly the arrival of hunters into North-America crossed over the Bering Strait landbridge from Asia


50
0:4:46,419 --> 0:4:49,72
coincided with the extinction of these animals and very likely these hunters


51
0:4:49,72 --> 0:4:53,99
went after these large animals that were slow and had a lot of meat.


52
0:4:53,99 --> 0:4:58,736
What is left in North-America were animals such as bison,


53
0:4:58,736 --> 0:5:3,479
deer and antelope that are not suited to domestication.


54
0:5:3,479 --> 0:5:5,699
In 1491


55
0:5:5,699 --> 0:5:10,19
native American tribes hunt wild animals to survive,


56
0:5:10,19 --> 0:5:14,949
but the village dwellers in the forests of the north-east and nomads on the planes


57
0:5:14,949 --> 0:5:18,979
developed methods to guarantee their meat supply.


58
0:5:18,979 --> 0:5:21,59
They can't domesticate these animals


59
0:5:21,59 --> 0:5:32,819
so they find a way of making their prey come to them.


60
0:5:32,819 --> 0:5:35,52
In the years before Columbus native Americans


61
0:5:35,52 --> 0:5:42,21
noticed the grass grows better after being burned by lightning strikes.


62
0:5:42,21 --> 0:5:47,78
So they start to burn the prairies and plains themselves.


63
0:5:47,78 --> 0:5:53,2
Many tribes use this technique including the Sioux, Cheyenne, Comanche,


64
0:5:53,2 --> 0:5:59,51
Shoshone and the Blackfeet. America in 1492 was not a pristine wilderness,


65
0:5:59,51 --> 0:6:3,779
that's a romantic myth, it was in many ways a managed landscape.


66
0:6:3,779 --> 0:6:12,139
Natives regularly burnt the forests and the prairie in order to attract the game.


67
0:6:12,139 --> 0:6:15,629
Not only does burning create lush grasslands,


68
0:6:15,629 --> 0:6:28,99
it keeps the forest open and makes hunting easier.


69
0:6:28,99 --> 0:6:34,909
The new rich pastures lured and increased the numbers of herbivores,


70
0:6:34,909 --> 0:6:43,889
as well as the predators that feed on them.


71
0:6:43,889 --> 0:6:50,509
They domesticate the land in order to attract wild animals.


72
0:6:50,509 --> 0:7:0,36
Nomadic central plain Indians are able to lure the biggest mammals in the Americas:


73
0:7:0,36 --> 0:7:4,189
the bison.


74
0:7:4,189 --> 0:7:5,53
Wherever they roam,


75
0:7:5,53 --> 0:7:18,77
bison are the main source of food and clothing and of tools made from their bones.


76
0:7:18,77 --> 0:7:20,669
But still the bison thrive.


77
0:7:20,669 --> 0:7:22,229
By 1491


78
0:7:22,229 --> 0:7:26,29
North-America is home to perhaps thirty million.


79
0:7:26,29 --> 0:7:30,159
They reigned on the prairies from Montana to Texas,


80
0:7:30,159 --> 0:7:34,629
pushed east by native Americans along a path of fire,


81
0:7:34,629 --> 0:7:47,559
opening up the forest to virgin land.


82
0:7:47,559 --> 0:7:50,69
The bison gained a new habitat


83
0:7:50,69 --> 0:8:0,539
far beyond their original range.


84
0:8:0,539 --> 0:8:4,47
Native Americans have no guns or horses.


85
0:8:4,47 --> 0:8:11,65
They hunt on foot.


86
0:8:11,65 --> 0:8:15,559
They dress in hides to get as close as possible


87
0:8:15,559 --> 0:8:21,89
and hunt with a bow and arrow, or spears, all made of wood and leather.


88
0:8:21,89 --> 0:8:37,669
bone and stone.


89
0:8:37,669 --> 0:8:47,26
Hunting the bison is essential for their survival.


90
0:8:47,26 --> 0:8:51,54
In Europe hunting is no longer about survival.


91
0:8:51,54 --> 0:8:53,59
Noblemen hunt for sport,


92
0:8:53,59 --> 0:9:39,32
for pleasure and prestige.


93
0:9:39,32 --> 0:9:43,63
And only the nobles are allowed to hunt.


94
0:9:43,63 --> 0:9:53,24
If ever they catch a peasant hunting he will be punished for poaching.


95
0:9:53,24 --> 0:9:57,85
Unlike in America there's no room here for an abundance of wildlife,


96
0:9:57,85 --> 0:10:7,4
for endless herds.


97
0:10:7,4 --> 0:10:9,59
In Europe the land is man-made.


98
0:10:9,59 --> 0:10:19,5
Agriculture and cities push the wildlife back.


99
0:10:19,5 --> 0:10:31,45
Untamed land is now a rarity, but they have one other major food source.


100
0:10:31,45 --> 0:10:37,68
Fish have long been cheap and abundant for every social class in Europe.


101
0:10:37,68 --> 0:10:41,7
Christianity, the common religion all over Europe in 1491


102
0:10:41,7 --> 0:10:43,99
approves of fish.


103
0:10:43,99 --> 0:10:47,87
Eating meat is banned on more than one hundred days a year.


104
0:10:47,87 --> 0:11:7,49
The demand for fish is huge, but intensive agriculture is damaging the fish supplies.


105
0:11:7,49 --> 0:11:8,7
Once unlimited


106
0:11:8,7 --> 0:11:17,6
supplies in Europe
are dwindling fast.


107
0:11:17,6 --> 0:11:21,89
What happened to the fish stocks in Europe?


108
0:11:21,89 --> 0:11:25,91
As people started to grow crops and cut back the wildwoods


109
0:11:25,91 --> 0:11:30,43
this released huge amounts of sediment into the water courses which change them


110
0:11:30,43 --> 0:11:37,53
from being fast clear-flowing rivers and streams into slow turbid rivers and streams


111
0:11:37,53 --> 0:11:42,34
and the freshwater fish found a problem with this, particularly migratory species


112
0:11:42,34 --> 0:11:48,19
that came up from the sea to spawn in the rivers, animals like salmon and sturgeon.


113
0:11:48,19 --> 0:11:50,51
There's another factor which also


114
0:11:50,51 --> 0:11:53,68
cut down the supplies is that these migratory fish and that was that people


115
0:11:53,68 --> 0:11:58,25
started to build dams along rivers and when that happened the migration


116
0:11:58,25 --> 0:12:6,71
runs were blocked and their populations declined.


117
0:12:6,71 --> 0:12:10,59
When supplies of fish dwindled in their polluted lakes and rivers,


118
0:12:10,59 --> 0:12:14,92
they turned to the sea.


119
0:12:14,92 --> 0:12:25,99
For the first time they set up large-scale sea fishing.


120
0:12:25,99 --> 0:12:36,6
They find abundance on a scale never seen before.


121
0:12:36,6 --> 0:12:40,82
And they exploit it.


122
0:12:40,82 --> 0:12:44,83
Cod and herring from the North Sea are the first to be fished.


123
0:12:44,83 --> 0:12:50,3
Every five years catches double.


124
0:12:50,3 --> 0:12:51,55
By 1300


125
0:12:51,55 --> 0:13:1,89
thousands of tons of dried fish are exported from Norway to Britain alone.


126
0:13:1,89 --> 0:13:8,34
But this is 1491


127
0:13:8,34 --> 0:13:14,46
Europe's rivers and lakes are now dirty and empty.


128
0:13:14,46 --> 0:15:14,46
And surroundings seas are fast becoming depleted.
