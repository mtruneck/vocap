Jacque Fresco - Dec. 19, 2010 "Relation to Academia" www.thevenusproject.com ãƒ» Part 3


2
0:0:7,62 --> 0:0:14,16
How many Catholics, whether they're the Lutheran, or Presbyterian Church, they get their point of view. 


3
0:0:14,16 --> 0:0:18,47
To go feel which one is closest. Some do, I don't doubt that. 


4
0:0:18,47 --> 0:0:25,13
There are many religious people that go to different Churches and stop at the one nearest to their values.


5
0:0:25,13 --> 0:0:32,99
That's what all people do. And if they all pick primitive things, your culture needs an overhaul.


6
0:0:32,99 --> 0:0:42,64
If we still go to war, you know. I think in the motion picture "Things to come" - somebody said to Dr. Cabal


7
0:0:42,64 --> 0:0:47,87
or the guy in charge that they're at war - "Still at it, eh?"


8
0:0:47,87 --> 0:0:56,54
See, there were some comments which normal people did not react to in the film, at all.


9
0:0:56,54 --> 0:1:4,5
They couldn't react to it. They have no background to react to it. They found a bunch of scientists running things


10
0:1:4,5 --> 0:1:12,4
and it just didn't look right. They'd look like - the answer was H.G. Well's friend said "it sounds like fascism."


11
0:1:12,4 --> 0:1:19,21
Now this system would sound like fascism. Cause Fresco lays out the schools, the buildings, the cities.


12
0:1:19,21 --> 0:1:27,82
Only because not enough people are into that yet. But there will be more people laying it out as they get into it.


13
0:1:27,82 --> 0:1:34,86
Edison taught people how to use the electric light. How to build generators. Or people that made generators 


14
0:1:34,86 --> 0:1:37,8
for Edison taught people to make generators.


15
0:1:37,8 --> 0:1:43,88
But the average person did not get it up and say "I don't want any generators, they're not god-given."


16
0:1:43,88 --> 0:1:50,21
There were some people that said that. They'd never use generators - they're out of business.


17
0:1:50,21 --> 0:1:58,51
So - presenting idea's is not the answer. Preparing people's attitude to be able to hear new idea's -


18
0:1:58,51 --> 0:2:4,36
so when they listen to you, they say "I don't know enough about the subject to make a decision; I think 


19
0:2:4,36 --> 0:2:12,24
I'll going back and read up on it, and come back next week. Very few people do that.


20
0:2:12,24 --> 0:2:18,18
Sure, you'll find evidence among some academicians to support some of the concepts.


21
0:2:18,18 --> 0:2:26,78
But not enough. I hate to use academicians, cause they climb up on the back of innovators.


22
0:2:26,78 --> 0:2:35,77
But I do understand reliance on academicians to help support the project. But that isn't real.


23
0:2:35,77 --> 0:2:41,3
I think people had to learn from the Wright Brothers - "How to build airplanes."


24
0:2:41,3 --> 0:2:48,7
If they built the first flying machine, the army said - the army was the first to order 5 airplanes from


25
0:2:48,7 --> 0:2:56,61
the Wright Brothers for surveillance. They attempted - "War tank is better for shooting", airplanes could only


26
0:2:56,61 --> 0:3:3,88
carry a rifle. Before that, they threw bottles, and stones at one another in the air. Did you know that?


27
0:3:3,88 --> 0:3:10,4
In the old days? Cause the airplane couldn't carry a cannon, it could only carry a rifle. 


28
0:3:10,4 --> 0:3:17,51
The guy would stand up from cover, and try to shoot the other plane down. And then they had a gun way above the 


29
0:3:17,51 --> 0:3:24,38
wing, so that it would clear the propeller. Then somebody invented a synchronous machine gun that


30
0:3:24,38 --> 0:3:29,94
shoots between the rotation of the blades. Did you know what I'm talking about? You don't?


31
0:3:29,94 --> 0:3:35,51
There's a bump on the camshaft. You know what that means? The camshaft turns the propellor - 


32
0:3:35,51 --> 0:3:41,78
and that bump operates the machine gun [imitates machine gun] between where the blade is.


33
0:3:41,78 --> 0:3:48,76
Otherwise, they shot off the propeller. Do you understand that? So, its the invention of the machine gun


34
0:3:48,76 --> 0:3:55,62
at the pilots eye view that enabled him to shoot down more planes. When the guns are on top, its only 


35
0:3:55,62 --> 0:4:3,27
an approximation. Do you understand? They're on the top wing, above the height of the propeller, or out 


36
0:4:3,27 --> 0:4:9,6
on the wings, which didn't give you a good view.


37
0:4:9,6 --> 0:4:16,6
So, invention compensates for human insufficiency.


38
0:4:16,6 --> 0:4:22,58
But we have a lot of inventors making things that are useless too. 


39
0:4:22,58 --> 0:4:30,47
A house should be a public library, a school, intercommunications systems, not just a home;


40
0:4:30,47 --> 0:4:37,26
with a laptop, the house is becoming more than just a place to sleep and eat. In the future, it'll be 


41
0:4:37,26 --> 0:4:45,16
a place with your built-in gym, and everything else, if you can afford it. Or, if the society can make a house - 


42
0:4:45,16 --> 0:4:50,56
the better-integrated people aren't interconnected to a richer society.


43
0:4:50,56 --> 0:4:53,7
People say "Will everybody be uniform?"


44
0:4:53,7 --> 0:5:0,39
If they were technically uniform it would be useful; non-technically it would not be useful.


45
0:5:0,39 --> 0:5:8,23
There's nothing the matter with uniformity. All architects, and all engineers have to pass a standard exam


46
0:5:8,23 --> 0:5:16,89
which is okay, for competence, you know. But if you know of technicians that advocate aspects of 


47
0:5:16,89 --> 0:5:25,39
The Venus Project, great. Technicians eventually will do that. But remember - they bring with them some 


48
0:5:25,39 --> 0:5:34,74
of the primordial slime. Cause they don't come from an environment that's objective, or scientific, yet. 


49
0:5:34,74 --> 0:5:45,71
A scientific world is in the early phases of the scientific method. Academia is not The Venus Project.


50
0:5:45,71 --> 0:5:53,2
Nor is it science - as its used today. They wouldn't work on bombers if they were part of The Venus Project.


51
0:5:53,2 --> 0:6:0,53
They wouldn't work on weapons. They wouldn't be patriotic if there was such a thing as a science.


52
0:6:0,53 --> 0:6:6,12
I'm sure there are, I'm sure they're having a tough time, too.


53
0:6:6,12 --> 0:6:13,73
I'm sure there's some scientist must come to some conclusion similar, but not all join together.


54
0:6:13,73 --> 0:6:21,72
Its very rare for someone to have the identical environment I had. Very rare. No, they don't come to 


55
0:6:21,72 --> 0:6:27,1
the same conclusion. Most scientists believe in free will.


56
0:6:27,1 --> 0:6:34,89
I asked them. Don't forget, I've met a lot of scientists. "Do you believe in free will?" - "Of course.


57
0:6:34,89 --> 0:6:43,4
I scored high in my school." - That means something else, it means that they have a different environment.


58
0:6:43,4 --> 0:6:50,4
But they don't look at it objectively. They feel they're achievers if they get a Nobel Prize.


59
0:6:50,4 --> 0:6:56,86
They feel good about it, rather than share it with other labs. You know.


60
0:6:56,86 --> 0:7:2,93
They don't have a scientific attitude yet. It isn't here yet.


61
0:7:2,93 --> 0:7:7,1
And if somebody advocates it, then you build a following. 


62
0:7:7,1 --> 0:7:13,74
And a following does not give an interpretation of Darwin's theory of evolution. There are people that 


63
0:7:13,74 --> 0:7:20,61
do that too - say "there's no evidence." If there's lots of evidence, they don't know what evidence means.


64
0:7:20,61 --> 0:7:27,13
If the evidence is that the trees of a million years ago are different than the trees today. They evolve;


65
0:7:27,13 --> 0:7:35,26
they change. Not necessarily for the better. There were poisonous snakes during the time of dinosaurs. 


66
0:7:35,26 --> 0:7:39,54
I'm sure they were different than the snakes of today.


67
0:7:39,54 --> 0:7:47,3
But all animals seem to undergo change according to digging into the ground.


68
0:7:47,3 --> 0:7:55,18
I don't think people will study too much of the past, except that nations, took over other nations, took 


69
0:7:55,18 --> 0:8:3,19
their wares, but no species by Patrick Henry, or anybody else. Cause they couldn't say anything relevant.


70
0:8:3,19 --> 0:8:10,6
I don't listen to most political speeches. Cause they don't say anything. They rarely say "we can improve 


71
0:8:10,6 --> 0:8:20,87
automotive production by sharing idea's with different companies." They don't say that.


72
0:8:20,87 --> 0:8:27,65
I don't find enough evidence to identify with peer groups. Do you know what I mean?


73
0:8:27,65 --> 0:8:33,9
I'm not saying they don't exist. I'm sure there are people out there in the scientific world that would 


74
0:8:33,9 --> 0:8:41,19
jump onto this. But some scientists may say "Have you heard about The Venus Project?" - "Oh, that guy


75
0:8:41,19 --> 0:8:46,28
is self-made. Never heard of him making any contributions."


76
0:8:46,28 --> 0:8:53,78
You know. They might do that. I don't know what they do. But, I can't concern myself with what they do.


77
0:8:53,78 --> 0:9:0,94
So here I'm proposing something. I wish that a lot of doctors at the same time said "Wash your hands."


78
0:9:0,94 --> 0:9:8,17
It was only one guy. And they say "What's your basis for that?" They didn't all have microscopes in the old days.


79
0:9:8,17 --> 0:9:15,86
So he showed them germs on the skin. That was when the real change came. With the microscope.


80
0:9:15,86 --> 0:9:23,64
But, there were people that even said "Well, how do you know they cause disease?" They were always present


81
0:9:23,64 --> 0:9:31,6
when a person had eruptions on the skin. That type of bacteria. When they had visual problems,


82
0:9:31,6 --> 0:9:37,54
they found the bacteria that was responsible. They always found similar bacteria on the eyes, on the hands, 


83
0:9:37,54 --> 0:9:44,75
on the genitals, sexually transmitted bacteria were the same. Do you understand what I mean. 


84
0:9:44,75 --> 0:9:51,6
But it wasn't until the microscope that uniform agreement can be established. It could not be established 


85
0:9:51,6 --> 0:10:0,61
by debate. No matter how - unless the doctor was very important. Most doctors listen to the established 


86
0:10:0,61 --> 0:10:7,34
leader of a system. We have no established leaders. 


87
0:10:7,34 --> 0:10:13,56
All I'd like to do is get the ball rolling, take it from there. But before I get the ball rolling, I want to get


88
0:10:13,56 --> 0:10:23,3
the idea's out on education, on learning theory, on how the brain is influenced by environment.


89
0:10:23,3 --> 0:10:32,59
If I can get that out, that's a good safety measure to control values, more so.


90
0:10:32,59 --> 0:10:37,4
I'd like to get "I don't know" out there too, more so.


91
0:10:37,4 --> 0:10:42,22
"I don't know." "I don't know enough about it to make a decision."
