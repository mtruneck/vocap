###1 ARTUR OLIVEIRA: Good afternoon, everyone.
###3 Thank you all so much for making it out.
###5 My name is Artur Oliveira.
###7 I'm on the authors at Google team.
###10 And it is my pleasure to introduce your speaker today.
###14 A lot of you might be wondering what
###16 does serving great guacamole have
###18 to do with eradicating poverty?
###20 And the thing is, I don't know.
###21 That's why we have Josh Ruxin here,
###24 who is here today with us to talk about his brand new book
###27 "A Thousand Hills Through Heaven,
###28 Love, Hope, and a Restaurant in Rwanda."
###32 Now, the "New York Times" called it an
###34 observing and affecting narrative.
###36 And the book has been receiving a lot of praise recently,
###39 so this really is a treat.
###41 Josh is on faculty at Columbia University,
###43 and he's been living in Rwanda since 2005.
###46 So without further ado, if we could please welcome up Josh.
###48 JOSH RUXIN: Thank you, Artur.
###50 [INAUDIBLE]
###51 Hi, everybody.
###55 So, this whole story actually starts about 30 years ago.
###58 I was a high school student at the height
###61 of the Ethiopian famine.
###63 I didn't really know much about it.
###65 But there was a really cute upper class woman
###71 who I saw go into some meeting after school.
###75 And I thought, huh, I wonder where she's going,
###77 so I followed her in and started to learn
###80 about this incredible catastrophe that was costing
###85 of course millions of lives in Ethiopia.
###88 This was back 1984, 1985.
###91 And that was actually the very beginning of my interest in it
###94 all.
###94 A couple years later, it led to a trip to Ethiopia.
###99 I was just a teenager.
###100 I'd never been outside of the country before,
###103 and ended up taking a little plane to the middle of nowhere
###109 in northern Ethiopia, get out of the plane on a grassy field.
###114 And everybody dropped their plows
###118 and came over to look at this white teenager
###121 from Connecticut.
###122 And a teacher came over and started to translate
###126 and asked all the kids who were gathered around,
###129 how do you think this kid and the other students got here?
###133 And one kid raised his hand and says, by mule?
###137 And then another kid points at me and says, come, in Amharic.
###144 And so I end up walking with these kids about a mile up
###147 to this mud-walled classroom.
###150 And there's a poster, which has got pictures
###154 of this club from high school from three years earlier
###158 that we had sent with an aid worker years before.
###162 And that for me was that aha moment that I'm sure all of you
###168 have had in one way or another about how very, very
###170 small this planet is, how you're only ever
###174 24 hours away from the poorest places, the most
###179 desperate places.
###180 And I decided then, hey, I want to make
###182 some sort of contribution.
###184 I want to figure out how to make a difference.
###186 And the next 30 years have been spent
###188 trying to figure out how the heck to do that,
###190 because it's not as easy as just having your heart into it.
###196 So, about eight years ago, now nine years ago, my wife and I
###203 were just about to be married.
###204 And we were given a very unusual sendoff gift.
###209 A very wealthy donor and fundraiser said to us, hey,
###216 I've seen a really interesting poverty reduction
###219 program in Kenya and some other places,
###221 but it's not happening in Rwanda, and it should be.
###225 So why don't you, Josh, and with your new wife Alissa,
###229 head to Rwanda and get it going.
###233 At that time, my wife had a public health degree
###237 from Harvard.
###238 She was sick and tired of taking the subway down to Wall Street,
###241 where she was running a executive public health
###244 program at Goldman Sachs.
###246 And she said, sure, let's go.
###249 We'll go for a year or two.
###251 And we never came back.
###253 
###256 We got to Rwanda just 10 years after the genocide.
###262 And I'm sure when most of you think about Rwanda,
###266 that is what you think about, the "Hotel
###268 Rwanda," the senseless horrible slaughter of over
###273 a million people in a hundred days back in 1994.
###278 But we actually arrived in a country
###282 that, while it certainly bore the scars of the genocide,
###288 was clean, secure, beautiful, with wonderful,
###292 welcoming people that was very much on the move.
###295 It was actually even then growing at rates
###298 that would make this administration very jealous,
###300 nearly double-digit economic growth rates every year.
###304 So I arrived to start working at the Millennium Village
###309 site, which is just down south of Kigali in a place
###312 called Mayange.
###313 And it was not booming.
###318 It actually was suffering from a horrible famine.
###322 The health center as I found it back then,
###325 this was actually the ambulance at the health center.
###329 Most days it was shut.
###330 The doors were just not open.
###332 And I asked, how do you get a nurse?
###335 And they said, well, you can go find her
###337 if you've got money to go find her.
###339 And then compounding everything, the land had no topsoil.
###345 All the topsoil had rolled down the hills
###347 because of deforestation.
###349 And people were literally starving
###351 because they couldn't produce enough food to eat.
###355 So with my colleagues, we started at the very beginning,
###358 which was, as long as people are dying from starvation,
###361 no one's really going to want to listen to a word
###363 that we have to say.
###365 So we started working on progressive terracing and line
###368 planting.
###369 And pretty soon, those very hills--
###371 this is a picture taken from the same exact angle--
###375 started to green up and started to produce food.
###378 And that was actually the very first harvest.
###381 That ended up changing everything,
###383 because lots of our thinking around building community
###388 grew out of the notion that you need
###391 to have an integrated set of interventions
###393 in order to reduce poverty ultimately.
###398 And I'll never forget, one day, one
###404 of the early adopters in the community-- who this might well
###407 have been her field.
###407 I can't remember.
###408 Her name's Jacqueline-- she came up to me, and she said,
###411 you know, Josh, I'm really angry with you,
###414 because for years I was the funeral director here.
###418 And we had deaths all the time.
###420 And I actually made a decent living
###423 directing those funerals.
###424 But you've put me out of business.
###427 No one dies here anymore.
###429 And that was the moment that the whole community really
###432 started to take over its development interventions,
###437 completely own it.
###438 And today, we've basically scaled down that project.
###442 And if it's any sign of the reduction
###447 if not virtual elimination of poverty,
###449 the real estate prices have gone up fivefold
###452 since the bottom in 2005 when people were literally just
###456 leaving because there was no reason to be in Mayange.
###459 
###462 Oh, that's Jacqueline, by the way.
###464 
###467 So meanwhile, my wife was in Kigali,
###471 and she was working with the orphans of the genocide.
###475 And she was working on a program called Generation Rwanda
###481 helping some of these kids get access
###483 to scholarships for university.
###485 But the vast majority didn't have access to scholarships.
###489 There weren't enough donors to pay for them.
###491 And Alissa had a huge insight, which was these kids need jobs.
###498 And with jobs, they're going to be
###500 able to put themselves through university.
###502 I said, great, honey.
###504 What do you propose?
###506 She said, well, how about we just open a cafe?
###508 There's no good place to get a cup of coffee around here.
###511 So, being a supportive husband, I said, that sounds great.
###515 I had this vision of plastic chairs,
###518 and plastic tables, and maybe a really nice espresso maker.
###523 And then some investors put millions of dollars
###529 behind a Starbucks-style cafe in Kigali.
###535 And she said, OK, second thought,
###538 let's do something different.
###540 Let's build the best gourmet restaurant in East Africa.
###544 So this is actually the building site.
###545 Alissa found this land.
###548 It's literally just two blocks away from the famed hotel
###553 Rwanda, the Hotel des Mille Collines.
###556 And this is construction back in 2007
###560 when my wife was pregnant with our first child.
###564 And this is the construction of the magnificent deck
###568 overlooking all of Kigali.
###573 And eventually Heaven emerged.
###576 That's what it looks like today just before service.
###579 Most nights we have a lot more customers than in that picture.
###582 
###586 And it's been an incredibly rewarding but on a daily basis
###595 hugely challenging endeavor.
###599 From the very beginning, most of our servers, most of our chefs,
###603 most everyone who works at Heaven
###605 had never had a job before and had never
###608 even set foot in a restaurant.
###611 So the training element of this hospitality business
###616 has not gone away.
###617 In fact, we have rotating chefs and rotating
###621 front-of-house managers.
###622 So if anyone has any friends out there, every six months or so,
###626 people cycle through, usually from the States and Europe,
###630 to really invest in the team at Heaven.
###634 I can send you the job description
###635 if you're interested.
###637 So what does, I mean as Artur set this up,
###644 what does serving up great guacamole
###646 or great filet mignon have to do with poverty reduction?
###650 That was something that I started
###651 to figure out very early on in the enterprise.
###656 One of our first cleaners was a woman named Solange.
###660 Solange, I don't even think I knew her name back
###663 in 2008 when we opened up.
###665 And one day Alissa found Solange in the kitchen,
###670 like around 11:00 or so, preparing food.
###673 But she was the cleaner.
###675 And Alissa came home, and she said,
###678 you won't believe who was in the kitchen cooking.
###681 I said, who?
###682 She said the cleaner was.
###684 This is ridiculous.
###685 We've got to sit down with the staff.
###687 We've got to sit down with the chefs.
###688 Why are they pawning off the work onto Solange?
###693 So that night, we sat down with the whole kitchen staff just
###698 before service.
###700 And I said, what are you all doing?
###702 Why was Solange in here cooking?
###705 And they replied, well, she was just making staff meal.
###710 I said, yeah, but that's your job.
###712 They said, yeah, but she's the best cook.
###716 So Solange today is actually the sous chef at Heaven.
###720 She's worked under Michelin-star chefs.
###723 She makes the best squash risotto you've ever tasted.
###727 She can knock out without even planning for it--
###732 for some reason, when people come into Heaven,
###734 they don't make reservations.
###736 So people will think nothing of walking
###739 into this restaurant in Central Africa with 30 people
###744 and expecting world-class service and world-class food.
###747 And Solange is actually able to knock those meals right out
###751 of the kitchen with no problem.
###753 
###757 That's Heaven by night out on the deck.
###760 That's Solange.
###762 Solange, by the way, is the very first member
###764 of her entire family to go to university.
###768 There's about a dozen kids and family at home
###772 who are completely supported by her income.
###775 She pays for their health care.
###776 She pays for their education.
###780 And yet Solange doesn't receive a charitable contribution.
###785 She doesn't receive a 501(c)(3) annual check.
###791 She's working for pay.
###794 And that lesson about financial sustainability
###799 really changed my outlook about how
###802 to think about what I've been doing in the public health
###805 sector.
###806 So in public health, I've got this organization
###808 called Health Builders.
###809 You can check it out, globalhealthbuilders.org.
###813 And we do two things.
###814 We actually take lessons from Heaven in accounting,
###819 and human resources, and in management.
###821 We go into health centers.
###823 We help them improve these public health centers
###826 to the point where they are cash flow positive.
###829 They're real functional businesses.
###831 And then we do something landmark.
###834 We actually let them go.
###837 Because that's one of the keys to doing development right
###841 is knowing when you've done your job
###843 and when everyone can take over and manage
###848 the future of the health center or the restaurant.
###850 Though we're not there yet with Heaven.
###853 And this is an example of that thinking
###857 around financial sustainability put to use.
###860 This is a health center right up by the mountain gorillas up
###865 in the northern part of the country.
###867 It was co-financed by a donor, a very generous donor,
###870 and by local funds.
###873 So we put together a public contract and built it.
###878 And then we trained the staff up and opened the doors.
###882 There's no plaque there that says Health Builders.
###885 It is a government of Rwanda health facility,
###888 and it runs on its own.
###892 So that's really the way that I see
###894 the future of development happening
###896 is that in countries like Rwanda, where
###900 the government cares about the public's health
###902 and really cares about real development and poverty
###906 eradication, it's going to be between the public sector
###910 and the private sector.
###912 The very first night that Heaven opened,
###916 my country director for the health work
###917 is a guy named [INAUDIBLE] Carabucci, huge guy,
###921 really tall.
###921 He says he's 6 foot 6.
###923 I think he's over 7 feet.
###926 And he walks in, looks out over 150 customers in Heaven,
###933 grabs my wife, and says, we don't need aid anymore.
###939 We don't need donor assistance anymore in Rwanda.
###942 What we need is a thousand Heavens.
###946 We actually need lots of businesses
###948 like this that are investing in management training, that
###950 are generating salaries.
###952 That's what's going to change this country.
###954 That's what's going to change the world.
###956 And actually that was the working title
###957 for a while for the book.
###960 So, I know that a lot of people often ask me, well,
###966 how do I have impact?
###967 I want to become a doctor.
###968 I want to become a nurse.
###969 Or I want to go to public health school
###971 because I want to make a difference.
###974 And my top-level advice on that front
###979 is, you don't have to do those things in order to have impact.
###983 And for that matter, you don't have to become a martyr,
###988 sacrifice yourself, in order to have huge impact.
###992 I think that's a little bit of the conventional wisdom
###995 is you've got to give everything up
###997 in order to reduce poverty and have social impact.
###1001 And our experience has been much different.
###1003 We have a good life.
###1005 We've got three kids.
###1008 We have high stress, high anxiety, just like everybody
###1012 does with their jobs.
###1013 But we feel really lucky to live in Rwanda
###1019 and to have the opportunity to make a contribution
###1022 in a way that is dignifying and in a way that
###1026 is led by the Rwandan people and by our friends.
###1030 So with that I wanted to open it up to all of you
###1033 and have a little bit of a discussion about this very
###1037 large restaurant.
###1038 We can seat up to 200.
###1039 In fact, there were 200 people in last night, called Heaven.
###1044 AUDIENCE: So, it's a high-end restaurant, and it's serving,
###1046 I'm assuming, wealthier people.
###1048 Are the people that mostly come in native Rwandans
###1051 or more tourists?
###1052 JOSH RUXIN: It's a split.
###1053 So, about a third of our clientele
###1056 are tourists who have come to see the gorillas in the mist.
###1061 And about a third are expats.
###1064 There's over 3,000 Americans, for example,
###1066 who live in Kigali.
###1068 And about a third are Rwandans, mainly higher class Rwandans.
###1074 But if it's Mother's Day, if it's a birthday,
###1077 if it's Christmas Eve or New Year's, it is a total mix,
###1083 and it's almost all Rwandese.
###1086 Rwandans actually-- this has been a real challenge for us--
###1090 don't have a culture of food.
###1093 And eating was actually something
###1095 done at home, done behind closed doors.
###1098 Maybe that grew out of the scarcity of food
###1100 over generations.
###1102 And so you will find Rwandese who drive in Porsche Cayennes,
###1109 but they insist on eating at home.
###1112 So it's been a challenge for us to really teach and educate
###1117 the market about great food and what that tastes like.
###1121 AUDIENCE: And then, just a quick follow-up,
###1123 I guess what I was wondering is did you
###1125 get any backlash in terms of having people lift themselves
###1128 out of poverty but also with this kind of contrasting
###1132 high-end restaurant, so the idea of people
###1135 taking jobs to lift themselves out
###1137 of poverty by serving people that are wealthier than them?
###1141 JOSH RUXIN: No.
###1142 AUDIENCE: I mean just in terms of a class issue.
###1145 JOSH RUXIN: No, I don't think over
###1147 the years we've ever seen that class issue.
###1149 AUDIENCE: So the focus is just really positive on the job
###1152 creation and everything that's going on?
###1154 JOSH RUXIN: Absolutely.
###1155 AUDIENCE: That's awesome.
###1155 JOSH RUXIN: Yes.
###1156 AUDIENCE: I have two question.
###1157 The first one, you mentioned that you left to Rwanda
###1160 and never came back.
###1162 So the first question is, what happened
###1163 with the rest of your family, extended family, friends?
###1166 Were they supportive?
###1167 JOSH RUXIN: Oh, the family back here--
###1169 AUDIENCE: Yes, exactly.
###1169 JOSH RUXIN: Oh yeah, I was just about to say,
###1171 that whole family's in Kigali right now.
###1172 AUDIENCE: No, exactly, that's the first one.
###1174 And the second one is that because of those connection,
###1177 maybe, did they help either via donation
###1180 or some of your friends decided to go there and help you?
###1183 Or did they just say, hey, good luck.
###1185 We wish you the best.
###1186 JOSH RUXIN: Well, we are not independently wealthy
###1190 and when we were building Heaven ran
###1192 into cost overruns, cost overruns.
###1194 We had actually taken out a second mortgage
###1197 on our apartment back in New York City, which of course we
###1199 had had every intention to return to.
###1202 And then we burned through that second mortgage
###1204 and then contacted our immediate family
###1207 and asked them to help us out and write some checks.
###1210 And then we burned through all that.
###1212 And we were feeling very sheepish before even opening
###1215 the doors and turned to friends and had
###1218 them write checks, not as donations.
###1220 And over the course of the first two years,
###1223 we actually paid off all the friends and family,
###1226 and then just last year paid off the rest of the debt.
###1231 So that's the debt situation, which isn't really
###1233 what your question was referring to.
###1235 In terms of family and their reaction,
###1238 they come and they visit.
###1240 They always expected that we would come back.
###1244 But here's something interesting,
###1247 which is, when I started working in development
###1250 back when I graduated from university,
###1253 I remember this is the early '90s,
###1255 and I was living in Bolivia.
###1257 And I would receive a letter and read the letter every day
###1263 for a month and a half until I got another letter.
###1266 
###1269 And my kids on a weekly basis get
###1272 to use Skype video with their grandparents.
###1276 I get to see my friends all the time.
###1278 It is completely transformed what that experience is.
###1282 Literally distance has been destroyed.
###1286 And it's so much easier than it ever was before to do it.
###1290 Of course, when I tell my wife that who's
###1293 about to board 32 hours of transport
###1297 with the three kids this Friday evening, she says,
###1301 no, it's not any easier.
###1302 Can't we just go on holiday break in the neighborhood?
###1306 But outside of that, the families
###1309 have been incredibly supportive.
###1311 And they love Rwanda.
###1312 I mean, everyone has fallen in love with Rwanda.
###1316 It really is this incredible jewel.
###1319 And I think they all see our hope, and our dream,
###1323 and our imagination, which is, let's not
###1325 leave all the great things in Rwanda in Rwanda.
###1328 Let's expand it.
###1329 Let's expand the health work to other countries.
###1332 Let's expand Heaven to other places.
###1334 Actually Alissa opened up a little boutique guest house
###1338 just last year.
###1339 It's been one of the best parts of the whole business,
###1341 and she wants to expand it to create more jobs
###1344 and hospitality to really get a feel for the whole spectrum
###1350 of what international consumers are looking for.
###1354 AUDIENCE: So you hear a lot in Uganda and Nigeria
###1357 about sort of the problem with brain drain and people
###1360 having aspirations to leave the country for education
###1363 and maybe having intentions to come back.
###1366 I know Rwanda's a little different
###1368 with the recent history, but how is the education
###1370 infrastructure?
###1371 Do a lot of people want to leave Rwanda for education?
###1375 JOSH RUXIN: They certainly do.
###1376 But first off, Rwanda is a tale of exceptionalism
###1381 because the genocide didn't just happen in 1994.
###1386 You've got to go back to 1959 to see its roots.
###1389 And from 1959 to 1994, you had hundreds of thousands
###1393 of people who left the country.
###1395 Some lived in refugee camps in Uganda and elsewhere.
###1398 But some made their way to the States, to the UK, to Belgium.
###1403 They got educated, and as soon as the war was over
###1408 and the genocide was over, they started coming back in.
###1411 And so you literally had this case
###1414 of the reverse of brain drain.
###1415 You had incredibly skilled people
###1417 who were exposed to the outside world.
###1420 Bear in mind, you saw the map before.
###1422 Rwanda is landlocked.
###1423 There's no poor.
###1424 It was never on a spice route.
###1426 And so critically, that is in part
###1428 where the prosperity and the future of Rwanda
###1433 has been pinned, all these people who actually came back
###1436 with real knowledge about what's going
###1438 on in the outside world, what's happening in technology, what's
###1441 happening in business.
###1443 So today what happens, certainly, I
###1447 know lots of students who have gone abroad and stayed abroad.
###1452 But I also know a whole lot who have gone abroad and come back
###1456 for jobs in tech and jobs in banking.
###1459 I wish they would come back for jobs at Heaven,
###1462 because that level of management is really needed.
###1466 It's needed at Heaven.
###1467 It's needed in the health sector.
###1468 It's needed in all those areas.
###1470 And it is building.
###1472 But Rwanda is essentially a new country, so reborn
###1476 just 19 years ago.
###1478 The 20th anniversary is coming up of the genocide.
###1481 And I think a lot of people with Mandela's death
###1485 are starting to think about that and remember,
###1487 oh yeah, when Nelson Mandela was elected president-- that
###1491 was in April 1994-- all eyes were on that
###1495 while the genocide was unfolding in Rwanda.
###1498 And I think that it's unfortunate
###1500 that we look to Africa now, and we think about Mandela's legacy
###1505 and overlook the fact that one of the best
###1508 stories of leadership, and growth, and prosperity,
###1511 and stability on the entire continent
###1513 and in the entire world is up to the north in the place
###1517 that I call home.
###1518 AUDIENCE: Hi, I just want to say I was in Rwanda in 2008,
###1522 and I went to your restaurant.
###1523 JOSH RUXIN: Thank you for being a patron.
###1524 AUDIENCE: And it was one of the most memorable experiences
###1526 I had in Africa.
###1528 And I also wondered if you had any experience starting
###1530 restaurants in the US and if you ran into any reluctance
###1534 from the local people about an American starting a business.
###1537 Because when I was there, I was under the impression
###1539 it was an African-owned restaurant.
###1541 Because we were told it was run by orphans.
###1545 And it didn't have the feeling of an American
###1547 or a foreign-owned business.
###1550 JOSH RUXIN: That's good to hear.
###1551 I guess I wasn't working that night.
###1554 So, I suppose if we had had any restaurant experience,
###1559 we might not have been so naive as to have gotten
###1562 into this business in the first place.
###1564 It's the world's hardest business.
###1566 And Alissa outside of a short stint as a barista
###1572 had no experienced in any related industry.
###1576 I actually was always the one who
###1578 wore the apron in the relationship.
###1580 She's cooked, in the course of our marriage
###1583 and our relationship, exactly one meal for me.
###1587 And that was very early on.
###1589 I've done all the cooking ever since.
###1590 And in the early days, I actually
###1592 did a lot of the cooking and a lot of the training
###1595 back in the kitchen.
###1596 I love food.
###1597 I love cooking.
###1598 I am not a chef.
###1600 I recognize my shortcomings, and that's
###1602 why we started bringing on international chefs
###1604 to think about the management.
###1605 And there's so much to think about in terms
###1609 of inventory and planing.
###1611 And as Americans in Rwanda starting up a business
###1617 and starting up a restaurant, we were embraced.
###1621 I mean, it took no more than 48 hours
###1624 to incorporate the business.
###1625 
###1628 Anyone, any one of you can come to Rwanda.
###1630 If you've got a business idea, you
###1631 can literally go to the Rwanda Development Board,
###1635 incorporate your business, and get moving.
###1637 It is effortless there.
###1639 So they really are welcoming private investment
###1642 and bringing entrepreneurial skills and management
###1645 to the country.
###1647 AUDIENCE: So you said you weren't there yet
###1649 in terms of handing off Heaven to be owned maybe
###1655 by the people that work there.
###1658 Are there plans to do that?
###1659 What's the timeline?
###1660 What does that look like?
###1663 JOSH RUXIN: Well, I think we're in an interesting position
###1666 right now.
###1666 The restaurant and the inn are doing well.
###1673 But it still does take an enormous amount of effort
###1676 from my wife, and on a really busy night from both of us.
###1680 It's sort of still all hands on deck because
###1682 of the unpredictability of the business.
###1684 And it's very hard to build that management set in Heaven staff
###1691 and bring them up to that management level.
###1693 We're constantly working on that and aiming for that.
###1697 And I think one of the solutions for it
###1699 is Heaven actually needs to grow to be a little bit bigger
###1703 as a business in order to have international trainers
###1707 constantly on board, constantly on staff,
###1710 so that we can move on and do other things
###1714 and not be as engaged in day-to-day management.
###1717 That said, compared to back in 2008,
###1720 when Alyssa and I would be at the restaurant until 1:00
###1724 in the morning every single night,
###1725 and then I went to my day job, which was in public health.
###1730 Compared to those days, we are very, very far
###1733 advanced and much, much closer to the realization
###1737 of that sustainability.
###1738 But the restaurant business is a little tricky.
###1741 It doesn't matter where you are in the world.
###1743 You know when the owner is not around.
###1745 That's just the nature of the beast.
###1748 And I hope that we can really get to that point.
###1752 At the same time, Heaven has become this incredible platform
###1758 for Alissa in particular to build out her ideas.
###1761 So last Saturday, she hosted on that beautiful terrace
###1765 the very first farmers market in Rwanda's history
###1769 and got all sorts of organic growers and people
###1772 producing really interesting products
###1774 to come in and do that.
###1776 There's theater that happens that she brings in
###1779 and art exhibitions.
###1780 And so it's a lot more than just dishing up food and dishing up
###1784 a great customer experience.
###1786 It's also about serving as a real cultural venue
###1788 to show off all the great things that are happening in Rwanda.
###1792 AUDIENCE: So I was actually born and raised in Kigali,
###1794 and I'm half Rwandan.
###1796 And I went to your restaurant in 2011.
###1798 It was really good.
###1799 And I want to thank you for spreading the gospel.
###1802 But my question was, you have mentioned many times
###1805 how exceptionally run Rwanda was and how safe it is.
###1809 What are your thoughts on aid for places
###1812 that aren't run like Rwanda?
###1816 JOSH RUXIN: So as you will read in the book,
###1818 I have pretty strong views on this
###1821 that when you think about aid and the level of aid,
###1825 for example, of the US government in Rwanda,
###1828 it's been well placed and well positioned.
###1831 Rwanda is famous for having some of the world's lowest levels
###1836 of corruption.
###1837 And I'm all for that kind of aid.
###1840 Because when the government in particular
###1843 cares about the public's health and the public's development--
###1847 you haven't been there since 2011?
###1849 AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].
###1850 JOSH RUXIN: Wi-Fi is on the public buses now in Kigali.
###1854 It's just extraordinary the ambition of the place.
###1857 But I've worked in so many other countries
###1861 where government officials have asked me
###1864 for bribes, where I felt as though the work of Health
###1868 Builders just could not take off because
###1871 of the corruption of the public sector.
###1874 And in a world where realistically, we've
###1877 got finite resources, sadly, for doing things
###1881 like public health, I would much rather
###1884 see those funds channeled to countries like Rwanda that
###1888 have a plan for sustainability, that have a plan for not
###1894 accepting donor aid in the future
###1896 in building out a tax base to do it on their own.
###1900 And I get enraged when I see countries
###1903 which have the resources, have the means, have the wealth
###1907 and just aren't doing it and yet are
###1909 receiving big chunks of aid.
###1911 As a humanitarian, I'm compelled and feel enormous sympathy
###1919 for the poor.
###1921 But at the same time, I feel as though we
###1924 need better systems and better milestones
###1926 in order to get the governments to take
###1929 this type of development on, and internalize it, and build out
###1934 what has happened in Rwanda.
###1936 In my book, I refer to five lessons.
###1940 And my lesson about what to say to those countries that
###1944 are incredibly corrupt that are looking for aid
###1947 relates to the middle finger.
###1949 AUDIENCE: So you said in the beginning
###1950 there was no local cuisine because people just
###1954 don't eat out.
###1955 What is your cuisine?
###1956 And what have you done to maybe tease out
###1958 the locals to participate?
###1960 JOSH RUXIN: So we've done a combination of things.
###1963 So the main local cuisine when Rwandese go out
###1966 for a traditional meal, it might be goat brochette, rice, beans,
###1971 relatively simple food with piri piri,
###1973 really spicy sauce, and also maybe
###1977 some matoke in a tomato sauce.
###1981 We have a very eccentric menu.
###1984 We have got probably our signature dish, which
###1987 has been on the menu now since we opened, is our filet mignon.
###1991 You want to talk about green, pasture-fed cows,
###1995 I mean, you're not going to find more sustainably raised cattle
###1999 than what you'll find in Rwanda.
###2000 It is a fabulous piece of beef.
###2002 And then we smother it in a cassava chimichurri sauce.
###2005 So we take cassava leaves, which are often
###2007 served as a local food in the form of a sombe, which
###2013 is with palm oil.
###2015 And we do it with olive oil, some garlic, and onion.
###2017 And then sometimes we'll actually take the matoke.
###2020 We'll take cream.
###2021 We'll take green bananas, and we'll mash them up
###2024 with some butter instead of potatoes.
###2026 So it has these local flavors, but it is clearly
###2032 an international dish.
###2034 And then I got to confess, probably
###2036 our most popular dessert over the years
###2039 has always been our molten chocolate brownie
###2042 with our homemade ice cream.
###2045 Anyway, well, it is so great to be here with all of you today.
###2048 And I want to welcome you to Heaven.
###2051 Come on in.
###2052 You can have a mojito on me.
###2055 And come out to Rwanda, and come have the experience
###2059 of seeing this country that has so much to show the world.
###2063 Lots of people say, oh, can I come on,
###2065 and can I volunteer for two weeks or three weeks?
###2068 And I say, don't think that you need
###2070 to come out as a volunteer to have impact.
###2072 You can have impact by coming out as a tourist,
###2075 spending money, eating in Heaven,
###2077 eating in other restaurants, giving good customer feedback,
###2081 and spreading the word.
###2083 Because that is a massive source of national income is tourism.
###2088 That really is one of the top still growing
###2091 exports in the country.
###2093 So that is a great way to be helpful.
###2097 Thank you so much.
###2099
