5
0:0:17,4 --> 0:0:20,4
<i>Oh, Eileen</i>


6

14
0:1:12,48 --> 0:1:15,6
<i>What are you doing playing army on Sunday
morning ? You're missing Grange Hill,</i>


15
0:1:15,6 --> 0:1:17,6
The TA is no game, Tim.


16
0:1:17,6 --> 0:1:20,4
It isn't the TA, Mike, it's the Rough Ramblers.


17
0:1:20,4 --> 0:1:24,4
You're a civilian, you don't understand. You're
thinking "It's Sunday, I'd rather be in bed."


18
0:1:24,4 --> 0:1:28,24
<i>And you're thinking "It's Sunday,
I'd rather be in Apocalypse Now, "</i>


19
0:1:28,24 --> 0:1:30,36
That's easy for you to say.
What are you doing later on ?


20
0:1:30,36 --> 0:1:33,76
- It's classified.
- Why don't you come round ? I'm bored.


21
0:1:33,76 --> 0:1:35,88
I can't - combat canoeing.


22
0:1:35,88 --> 0:1:39,4
I'm learning to Eskimo roll with a two-stone
rucksack on my back, holding a loaded rifle.


23
0:1:39,4 --> 0:1:42,8
They don't have rifles
in the Rough Ramblers, Mike.


24
0:1:42,8 --> 0:1:43,72
- Hand grenades ?
- No.


25
0:1:43,72 --> 0:1:45,48
- Anthrax ?
- Mike !


26
0:1:45,48 --> 0:1:51,68
Listen, Tim, gotta go. Looks like we're
moving out. Roger Bravo Tango Alpha.


27
0:1:51,68 --> 0:1:57,0
Come on, Mike.


28
0:1:57,0 --> 0:2:4,24
Yay ! Danny Kendall's about to die.


29
0:2:4,24 --> 0:2:7,76
You're right, that is better than
when Jeremy went into the swimming pool


30
0:2:7,76 --> 0:2:11,72
to retrieve Fay's necklace
and suffered a brain embolism.


31
0:2:11,72 --> 0:2:13,76
Bronson's got to pay.


32
0:2:13,76 --> 0:2:16,2
Bronson's got to pay !


33
0:2:16,2 --> 0:2:21,56
<i>Tim, Bronson's got to pay,
He's got a toupee,</i>


34
0:2:21,56 --> 0:2:25,68
Can I bring the bike in ? Your landlady's
got the look of a bike thief about her.


35
0:2:25,68 --> 0:2:28,8
What, ageing female divorcee ? What's
she gonna do, sell it to buy Jacob's Creek ?


36
0:2:28,8 --> 0:2:33,16
Don't get sarky, that bike's my living. Not like
you pretending to be a struggling cartoonist,


37
0:2:33,16 --> 0:2:36,8
poncing off the state while decent taxpayers
like me fund your drink problem.


38
0:2:36,8 --> 0:2:38,88
I wouldn't mind so much,
but you seem to be having such a shit time.


39
0:2:38,88 --> 0:2:42,92
Anyway, I was just coming back from a club,
right, passed your gaff and I remembered -


40
0:2:42,92 --> 0:2:44,96
you owe me 20 quid.


41
0:2:44,96 --> 0:2:47,6
Daisy, this is Tyres,
he bikes my drawings round for me.


42
0:2:47,6 --> 0:2:50,36
Tyres ! Yeah, Tim told me
he had more than one friend,


43
0:2:50,36 --> 0:2:55,24
<i>I didn't believe him, but here you are -
it's The Village Of The Damned !</i>


44
0:2:55,24 --> 0:2:59,4
- Are youse two... ?
- What, hand ? I don't...


45
0:2:59,4 --> 0:3:1,64
Are youse two an item ?


46
0:3:1,64 --> 0:3:4,4
No ! No.That's... No. Well...


47
0:3:4,4 --> 0:3:7,56
No, Daisy's not like that.
That's funny, that's actually funny.


48
0:3:7,56 --> 0:3:11,48
- No, we're just mates, aren't we ? Chums.
- Get off me !


49
0:3:11,48 --> 0:3:15,88
Oh, I see, youse are er... "friends".


50
0:3:15,88 --> 0:3:19,4
- Yeah.
- Yeah.


51
0:3:19,4 --> 0:3:20,72
Did you want a cup of tea, Tyres ?


52
0:3:20,72 --> 0:3:22,48
I couldn't eat a thing,
my stomach's like a walnut.


53
0:3:22,48 --> 0:3:24,76
- Can't you even have tea ?
- No, no solids.


54
0:3:24,76 --> 0:3:27,72
- Something orange ?
- Er, water ?


55
0:3:27,72 --> 0:3:56,24
Water ? OK.


56
0:3:56,24 --> 0:4:0,8
Hello ? What, already ?


57
0:4:0,8 --> 0:4:3,8
All right. I'll see you later.


58
0:4:3,8 --> 0:4:5,56
- Who was that ?
- It was Mike.


59
0:4:5,56 --> 0:4:9,56
He just nearly drowned doing an Eskimo roll.
He put too many pebbles in his rucksack.


60
0:4:9,56 --> 0:4:11,72
<i>Last time I seen Mike he was on Crimewatch,</i>


61
0:4:11,72 --> 0:4:15,68
No, that was a case of mistaken identity.
Police had his house surrounded last week.


62
0:4:15,68 --> 0:4:19,64
- No, this was about two months ago.
- Oh, yeah, that was him.


63
0:4:19,64 --> 0:4:21,4
What did you do last night ?


64
0:4:21,4 --> 0:4:25,44
Last night ? Last night was A1,
tip-top, clubbing jam fair.


65
0:4:25,44 --> 0:4:29,44
It was a sandwich of fun on ecstasy bread,
wrapped up in a bag like disco fudge.


66
0:4:29,44 --> 0:4:34,36
<i>Doesn't get much better than that. I just wish
I could control these fucking mood swings !</i>


67
0:4:34,36 --> 0:4:39,4
<i>So what did youse two friends do last night ?</i>


68
0:4:39,4 --> 0:4:43,32
Oh, we just stayed in, didn't we ?
Had a laugh, played Scrabble.

73
0:4:59,24 --> 0:5:2,24
- Captain Marvel says it.
- It's a nonsense invented word.


74
0:5:2,24 --> 0:5:8,52
You're only doing that so you can use Z.
Take it off, it's not a word.


75
0:5:8,52 --> 0:5:10,56
Pro V. Pantene Pro V.


76
0:5:10,56 --> 0:5:12,92
You can't have Pantene Pro V !


77
0:5:12,92 --> 0:5:17,52
It's the ingredient in the shampoo
that makes the hair silky and smooth !


78
0:5:17,52 --> 0:5:19,96
It's a word they made up
to make shampoo sound important !


79
0:5:19,96 --> 0:5:22,12
You're so naive. I cannot believe...


80
0:5:22,12 --> 0:5:26,84
It probably isn't a word !


81
0:5:26,84 --> 0:5:28,4
Fuck !


82
0:5:28,4 --> 0:5:31,24
- What ?
- The last four letters you threw spelt "fuck".


83
0:5:31,24 --> 0:5:34,44
Oh. What do you think that means ?


84
0:5:34,44 --> 0:5:37,8
I see. So you skipped the sex part
and went straight to the Scrabble.


85
0:5:37,8 --> 0:5:41,24
I can't get my head round this platonic
inter-gender relationship malarkey.


86
0:5:41,24 --> 0:5:42,56
It just doesn't seem right.


87
0:5:42,56 --> 0:5:45,36
Don't get me wrong, I don't mind
having a chinwag with a honey,


88
0:5:45,36 --> 0:5:48,28
but I just like to do it after waggling her chin,
you know what I mean ?


89
0:5:48,28 --> 0:5:51,72
- Yeah.
- You like to waggle your willie on her chin ?


90

- I work for a living. What do you do ?
- I write, actually.


93
0:6:0,0 --> 0:6:2,84
Oh, do you ? In other words,
you're on the dole.


94
0:6:2,84 --> 0:6:5,84
So anyway, are youse two friends
coming out with me tonight or what ?


95
0:6:5,84 --> 0:6:8,8
- No money.
- I'll lend you the money.


96
0:6:8,8 --> 0:6:11,96
- I already owe you 20 quid.
- Do you ?


97
0:6:11,96 --> 0:6:13,6
No.


98

0:6:15,48 --> 0:6:18,0
- So we'll see you later, then, yeah ?
- Cool, right.


100

OK, I'm going off for a shower, a shit and
a shave. I'll be back for youse about eleven.

Pack your party bags, people,
cos tonight is gonna be a large one, all right ?


102

Be lucky ! Oi-oi !


103
0:6:29,48 --> 0:6:33,56
- What was all that about Madonna ?
- Tyres has got a really short attention span.


104
0:6:33,56 --> 0:6:39,76
I remember once... Oh, look, wrestling.


105
0:6:39,76 --> 0:6:42,6
- Get the stick, get the stick !
- Come on.


106
0:6:42,6 --> 0:6:44,44
- Aargh !
- Sorry, mate.


107
0:6:44,44 --> 0:6:51,12
- Bastard !
- Sorry. God.


108
0:6:51,12 --> 0:6:55,12
I haven't been to a club in ages.
I think we should ask Brian to come.


109
0:6:55,12 --> 0:6:59,4
I don't really see Brian throwing
shapes in the church of dance, do you ?


110
0:6:59,4 --> 0:7:2,16
Well, he might if we ask Twist to come.


111
0:7:2,16 --> 0:7:5,64
- Brian and Twist ?
- Yeah ! Get with the programme !


112
0:7:5,64 --> 0:7:8,4
- Although Tyres'll think we're double-dating.
- Urgh.


113
0:7:8,4 --> 0:7:11,12
He was funny, wasn't he ?


114
0:7:11,12 --> 0:7:13,6
What did you mean
when you said "Daisy's not like that" ?


115
0:7:13,6 --> 0:7:15,32
- I never said that.
- You did.


116
0:7:15,32 --> 0:7:18,6
He said "Are you two... ?"
and you said "No, Daisy's not like that."


117
0:7:18,6 --> 0:7:21,96
- I just wondered what you meant.
- I just meant... I meant you're not like that.


118
0:7:21,96 --> 0:7:24,6
I don't see you in that way.


119
0:7:24,6 --> 0:7:29,8
- What am I ? Chopped liver ?
- I wish !


120
0:7:29,8 --> 0:7:34,68
You're too hung up on your ex-girlfriend to
even notice the existence of another woman.


121
0:7:34,68 --> 0:7:36,72
Who said that ? !


122
0:7:36,72 --> 0:7:40,56
No, I'm serious. I'm serious,
I think you've got a big problem.


123
0:7:40,56 --> 0:7:43,72
Shut up ! You don't know anything
about my problems !


124
0:7:43,72 --> 0:7:47,8
Yes, I do. Half a bottle of Galliano
and that's all you talk about.


125
0:7:47,8 --> 0:7:50,36
- Bloody Galliano.
- No, it's an obsession, Tim, it's unhealthy.


126
0:7:50,36 --> 0:7:52,48
I heard you call her name out in your sleep
the other night.


127
0:7:52,48 --> 0:7:53,64
How did you know I was asleep ?


128
0:7:53,64 --> 0:7:56,92
Why would you call her name out
if you were awake ?


129
0:7:56,92 --> 0:8:1,0
All I'm saying is I think you've got
a V big problem with your ex-G-friend.


130
0:8:1,0 --> 0:8:4,28
Just back off, will you ?
What do you care about what I do, anyway ?


131
0:8:4,28 --> 0:8:7,44
All right ! I was just making an observation.


132
0:8:7,44 --> 0:8:13,72
Yeah, well, don't, all right ?
You don't know what you're talking about.


133
0:8:13,72 --> 0:8:22,2
- Sorry !
- It's all right.


134
0:8:22,2 --> 0:8:24,76
You gonna ask Brian if he wants to come out ?


135
0:8:24,76 --> 0:8:26,8
Yes !


136
0:8:26,8 --> 0:8:40,24
- Are you gonna sulk all day ?
- No !


137
0:8:40,24 --> 0:8:42,4
Can't come out.


138
0:8:42,4 --> 0:8:44,76
We're going to a club later.
Do you want to come ?


139
0:8:44,76 --> 0:8:49,0
- I don't go to clubs.
- What do you mean, you don't go to clubs ?


140
0:8:49,0 --> 0:8:54,4
I'm working, Tim. Working.
Do you understand ?


141
0:8:54,4 --> 0:8:55,84
No, sorry. Got me there.


142
0:8:55,84 --> 0:8:59,64
Trying to... avoid...


143
0:8:59,64 --> 0:9:2,64
clichйs


144
0:9:2,64 --> 0:9:6,96
by not actually placing my brush
on the canvas.


145
0:9:6,96 --> 0:9:8,64
Wow. Right.


146
0:9:8,64 --> 0:9:12,4
- I'm using my penis.
- Finally !


147
0:9:12,4 --> 0:9:14,56
Do you want to see ?


148
0:9:14,56 --> 0:9:18,76
No, I'm just about to have my tea.
Why don't you come out ? It'll be good for you.


149
0:9:18,76 --> 0:9:21,32
No, it won't.


150
0:9:21,32 --> 0:9:24,0
Twist'll be there.


151
0:9:24,0 --> 0:9:31,8
Will she ?


152
0:9:31,8 --> 0:9:35,92
Can't.


153
0:9:35,92 --> 0:9:39,6
Huge.


154
0:9:39,6 --> 0:9:41,4
- It's a no.
- Shh !


155
0:9:41,4 --> 0:9:43,24
Money, money,
that's all you care about.


156
0:9:43,24 --> 0:9:47,16
- What do you know about what I care about ?
- More than you think, young lady !


157
0:9:47,16 --> 0:9:49,2
Leave me alone !


158
0:9:49,2 --> 0:9:58,32
<i>Oh, I feel for Amber,</i>


159
0:9:58,32 --> 0:10:1,36
<i>I feel for Amber,</i>


160
0:10:1,36 --> 0:10:3,24
<i>Why you gotta play that song so loud ?</i>


161
0:10:3,24 --> 0:10:10,36
<i>Because we want to, because we want to</i>


162
0:10:10,36 --> 0:10:12,52
That'll be Marsha.


163
0:10:12,52 --> 0:10:15,4
No !


164
0:10:15,4 --> 0:10:18,72
- Hi, Marsha.
- Hello.


165
0:10:18,72 --> 0:10:21,96
Sorry about the noise. Periods, you know.


166
0:10:21,96 --> 0:10:25,4
- Her dad left.
- I thought he left when she was two.


167
0:10:25,4 --> 0:10:30,6
Yeah, yeah. She is milking it slightly.


168
0:10:30,6 --> 0:10:34,8
- So do you want a tea ?
- No, no, I won't intrude.


169
0:10:34,8 --> 0:10:36,8
Yeah, all right, then, I'll have a small one.


170
0:10:36,8 --> 0:10:41,0
One small tea.


171
0:10:41,0 --> 0:10:46,68
It's difficult, isn't it ? Me and my mum
used to row all the time.


172
0:10:46,68 --> 0:10:50,8
I'll worry about you
if you stay out later than ten.


173
0:10:50,8 --> 0:10:57,96
- Try to think about my feelings.
- Oh, all right.


174
0:10:57,96 --> 0:11:1,6
- Bye, Mum. Love you.
- Bye, dumpling. Love you too.


175
0:11:1,6 --> 0:11:5,84
Oh, yeah ! She used to go ballistic.


176
0:11:5,84 --> 0:11:10,6
She'd say "You're not going out"
and I'd say "Yes, I am."


177
0:11:10,6 --> 0:11:13,8
It was a nightmare.
She was just so unreasonable.


178
0:11:13,8 --> 0:11:17,44
- For God's sake, she was worried about you.
- No, she wasn't.


179
0:11:17,44 --> 0:11:21,44
She was scared to face a life without me
so she tried to stop me from growing.


180
0:11:21,44 --> 0:11:24,68
That is so self-obsessed,
as if everything revolved around you.


181
0:11:24,68 --> 0:11:29,0
She probably looked forward to you going
but wanted to show she cared about you.


182
0:11:29,0 --> 0:11:32,32
If she'd wanted to do that,
she could have bought me that pony.


183
0:11:32,32 --> 0:11:35,92
That's what it boils down to with you -
money, money, money. It's all you care about.


184
0:11:35,92 --> 0:11:39,4
- What do you know about what I care about ?
- More than you think, young lady.


185
0:11:39,4 --> 0:11:49,8
Oh, leave me alone !


186
0:11:49,8 --> 0:12:8,28
You got any biscuits ?


187
0:12:8,28 --> 0:12:9,72
How is she ?


188
0:12:9,72 --> 0:12:14,8
The fibreglass on the outer casing
was severely damaged in the incident.


189
0:12:14,8 --> 0:12:16,68
- What happened ?
- Showing off, Tim.


190
0:12:16,68 --> 0:12:20,4
I had fifteen rocks in my rucksack
instead of the regulation five.


191
0:12:20,4 --> 0:12:23,52
I knew something was wrong when I got her
in the water. She was sitting so low.


192
0:12:23,52 --> 0:12:25,28
So low.


193
0:12:25,28 --> 0:12:29,12
But I didn't stop, Tim. Fifteen rocks
in my rucksack and everyone knew it.


194
0:12:29,12 --> 0:12:31,16
So what happened when you rolled ?


195
0:12:31,16 --> 0:12:33,72
I lost control of the vessel
two feet from the shore.


196
0:12:33,72 --> 0:12:36,8
As I struggled to right her,
I banged into the jetty,


197
0:12:36,8 --> 0:12:38,2
damaging the canoe's carcass.


198
0:12:38,2 --> 0:12:43,0
The ramble leader had to dive in
and rescue me from beneath the canoe.


199
0:12:43,0 --> 0:12:45,4
So it wasn't so much an Eskimo roll,


200
0:12:45,4 --> 0:12:51,68
<i>it was more a case of rolling right Inuit !</i>


201
0:12:51,68 --> 0:12:53,92
Inuit's another word for Eskimo.


202
0:12:53,92 --> 0:12:59,28
I've been thrown out, Tim. The
Rough Ramblers don't want me any more.


203
0:12:59,28 --> 0:13:1,52
Come on, come on. Come on.


204
0:13:1,52 --> 0:13:4,76
I've gotta face it, Tim.
I'm not the big man, not the leader.


205
0:13:4,76 --> 0:13:8,28
No-one's ever gonna look up to me.
I feel like a failure.


206
0:13:8,28 --> 0:13:10,96
You're not a failure, Mike, you're not.


207
0:13:10,96 --> 0:13:13,84
You're too good for them.
They're not ready for you.


208
0:13:13,84 --> 0:13:16,76
You're a renegade, you're a soldier of fortune.


209
0:13:16,76 --> 0:13:20,2
- Yeah, like the A-Team.
- Yeah, you're like Mr T but white and hairy.


210
0:13:20,2 --> 0:13:23,32
- I am, aren't I ?
- I feel sorry for anybody who says you're not.


211
0:13:23,32 --> 0:13:24,96
<i>- I pity the fool.
- I pity the fool.</i>


212
0:13:24,96 --> 0:13:27,64
- "I ain't going on no plane, sucker."
- Stop that.


213
0:13:27,64 --> 0:13:29,96
- I'll never be in the real army, though, will I ?
- No.


214
0:13:29,96 --> 0:13:38,84
- Cos of what happened.


215
0:13:38,84 --> 0:13:42,32
I know, Mike, and I'm sorry,
but this was a long time ago.


216
0:13:42,32 --> 0:13:44,56
I haven't let you down since, have I ?


217
0:13:44,56 --> 0:13:47,56
No.


218
0:13:47,56 --> 0:13:50,72
- And I never will.
- I know.


219
0:13:50,72 --> 0:13:54,64
Come 'ere, you big twat.


220
0:13:54,64 --> 0:14:1,52
- Ahem ! Excuse me.
- Just a second.


221
0:14:1,52 --> 0:14:6,48
OK.


222
0:14:6,48 --> 0:14:10,52
Mike !


223
0:14:10,52 --> 0:14:13,88
- Cheap Dutch lager for the lady ?
- No, thanks.


224
0:14:13,88 --> 0:14:17,68
- Oh, thanks( !)
- I'm on a special diet. I have to eat like a bird.


225
0:14:17,68 --> 0:14:26,32
What, like this ?


226
0:14:26,32 --> 0:14:29,2
- Where's Brian ?
- Yeah, Tim, where's Brian ?


227
0:14:29,2 --> 0:14:32,8
- Up his own arse.
- You don't like him ?


228
0:14:32,8 --> 0:14:34,92
I do like him, I'm just not sure why.


229
0:14:34,92 --> 0:14:38,2
How are you, Mike ?


230
0:14:38,2 --> 0:14:41,48
- Yep.
- That's a well-fitted body warmer, Mike.


231
0:14:41,48 --> 0:14:43,16
It's a life jacket.


232
0:14:43,16 --> 0:14:45,44
- Have you been yachting ?
- I've been all-terrain rambling.


233
0:14:45,44 --> 0:14:50,6
Kind of off-road rambling.
Comes in all forms of outdoor pursuits -


234
0:14:50,6 --> 0:14:53,32
walking, canoeing, killing.


235
0:14:53,32 --> 0:14:57,52
- Killing ?
- No, no. No killing.


236
0:14:57,52 --> 0:15:4,6
- Maybe you should take the jacket off now.
- He will when he's ready.


237
0:15:4,6 --> 0:15:7,96
- Coming out tonight, Mike ?
- I don't know. I don't really go out much.


238
0:15:7,96 --> 0:15:12,2
- I haven't got anything to wear.
- Come on, Mike. Come on ! Let's all go out.


239
0:15:12,2 --> 0:15:17,2
Let's get dressed up and go out.
We'll be like a gang. Like a group.


240
0:15:17,2 --> 0:15:22,6
Like an army. Yeah.


241
0:15:22,6 --> 0:15:25,2
- Try this.
- Hey, is this mine ?


242
0:15:25,2 --> 0:15:27,84
- That's mine !
- I let you borrow my clothes.


243
0:15:27,84 --> 0:15:35,96
Why would I want to borrow your clothes ?


244
0:15:35,96 --> 0:15:39,0
Oh, you look fantastic !


245
0:15:39,0 --> 0:15:41,4
- Too tight ?
- No !


246
0:15:41,4 --> 0:15:44,68
It does look really good. Maybe you could
tie something round your waist...


247
0:15:44,68 --> 0:15:46,8
if you feel a bit self-conscious.


248
0:15:46,8 --> 0:15:49,56
- The style's a bit feminine, isn't it ?
- No !


249
0:15:49,56 --> 0:15:53,72
Of course it's too feminine, it's a girl's top !
Get away from him.


250
0:15:53,72 --> 0:15:57,32
Mike, don't let them dress you up
like a giant cock.


251
0:15:57,32 --> 0:15:59,32
I had to dress up
as an elderly Israeli woman once.


252
0:15:59,32 --> 0:16:1,64
<i>- Did you ?
- I didn't have to.</i>


253
0:16:1,64 --> 0:16:14,92
We should talk.


254
0:16:14,92 --> 0:16:16,68
Is this too much ?


255
0:16:16,68 --> 0:16:20,24
- Yes.
- No !


256
0:16:20,24 --> 0:16:22,76
Oh, hi, Bri.


257
0:16:22,76 --> 0:16:26,4
- Can I use your video while you're out ?
- What are you gonna do ?


258
0:16:26,4 --> 0:16:30,56
Stick it to canvas as part of a piece depicting
a society populated by cathode junkies


259
0:16:30,56 --> 0:16:35,44
selling their imagination for quick-fix
media hits from the Blockbuster syringe ?


260
0:16:35,44 --> 0:16:40,64
<i>No, I want to record Ready Steady Cook,</i>


261
0:16:40,64 --> 0:16:42,48
OK.


262
0:16:42,48 --> 0:16:45,4
- You're sure you don't want to come out ?
- No, I don't go to clubs.


263
0:16:45,4 --> 0:16:53,8
- Oh, why ?
- Erm...


264
0:16:53,8 --> 0:16:55,84
- Just don't.


265
0:16:55,84 --> 0:16:59,24
Get that, will you, Mike ?


266
0:16:59,24 --> 0:17:2,36
So, er... packed the party bag ?


267
0:17:2,36 --> 0:17:7,48
Yes, two fresh jumpers, two fresh T-shirts,
two woolly hats, all right ?


268
0:17:7,48 --> 0:17:10,52
You saved any small countries
from tyranny recently ?


269
0:17:10,52 --> 0:17:13,8
- No.
- I like a soldier that minds his own business.


270
0:17:13,8 --> 0:17:16,76
Wahey ! Oh, you lucky people !


271
0:17:16,76 --> 0:17:19,36
- Who's this ?
- It's Brian. He's not coming.


272
0:17:19,36 --> 0:17:22,8
- Why are you not coming ?
- Well... Yeah, why aren't you coming ?


273
0:17:22,8 --> 0:17:27,44
Why aren't you coming, Brian ?
It won't be the same without you. Please !


274
0:17:27,44 --> 0:17:29,8
I don't go clubbing !


275
0:17:29,8 --> 0:17:32,0
Hello, everyone.


276
0:17:32,0 --> 0:17:34,24
- Oh, hi, Marsha.
- Hi, Marsha.


277
0:17:34,24 --> 0:17:36,36
You all going out ?


278
0:17:36,36 --> 0:17:38,36
Yeah, except Brian.


279
0:17:38,36 --> 0:17:51,36
Looks like it's just you and me, then, Brian.


280
0:17:51,36 --> 0:17:54,0
- I'm gonna put my coat in the cloakroom.
- Yeah, take mine, will you, Daisy ?


281
0:17:54,0 --> 0:18:8,76
- Take mine, too.
- There's no point us both queuing, is there ?


282
0:18:8,76 --> 0:18:33,76
Thanks very much, little lady.


283
0:18:33,76 --> 0:18:36,92
- Who wrote the music ?
- What ?


284
0:18:36,92 --> 0:18:40,52
- Who wrote the music ?
- I'm sorry, I can't hear you.


285
0:18:40,52 --> 0:20:39,72
What ?


286
0:20:39,72 --> 0:20:42,56
I've got to dance !


287
0:20:42,56 --> 0:21:16,52
Let's weave !


288
0:21:16,52 --> 0:21:19,76
Hey, listen, I'm sorry about earlier on,
snapping at you.


289
0:21:19,76 --> 0:21:21,68
I was so out of order. I'm really sorry.


290
0:21:21,68 --> 0:21:23,32
No !


291
0:21:23,32 --> 0:21:26,4
No, it's fine. It was fine. It's good.


292
0:21:26,4 --> 0:21:27,92
- Is it ?
- Yeah, we're on another level.


293
0:21:27,92 --> 0:21:31,44
Yeah, we are, cos we can snap at each other
and it doesn't matter


294
0:21:31,44 --> 0:21:33,96
and it's not a problem, it's not an issue,
you know what I mean ?


295
0:21:33,96 --> 0:21:36,0
It's beneath us, yeah.


296
0:21:36,0 --> 0:21:39,96
Yeah, cos I like you, I do.
I just like living with you, it's fun.


297
0:21:39,96 --> 0:21:43,52
You know, you're so talented,
you're gonna do so well.


298
0:21:43,52 --> 0:21:46,36
<i>You are. You are. No, you are.</i>


299
0:21:46,36 --> 0:21:48,72
<i>- You're so good.
- No.</i>


300
0:21:48,72 --> 0:21:50,8
<i>- You're such a good artist.
- Am I ?</i>


301
0:21:50,8 --> 0:21:53,36
- You are ! You're so good.
- I am.


302
0:21:53,36 --> 0:21:56,28
You're gonna be fine,
we're both gonna be fine, gonna do well.


303
0:21:56,28 --> 0:21:59,44
We're gonna do so well and when we do,
we'll get a big house in Hampstead


304
0:21:59,44 --> 0:22:2,52
and we'll get a room in the house
and have our own club.


305
0:22:2,52 --> 0:22:5,32
Have a club and we'll get all our friends in.


306
0:22:5,32 --> 0:22:8,92
We'll be like the King and Queen of Clubland,
you and me.


307
0:22:8,92 --> 0:22:12,56
Yeah, you and me.


308
0:22:12,56 --> 0:22:15,68
Yaaay ! Ah-ha-ha !


309
0:22:15,68 --> 0:22:17,92
Terribly sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.


310
0:22:17,92 --> 0:22:30,16
<i>I was just wondering if you two friends
would like to come and join the collective.</i>


311
0:22:30,16 --> 0:22:35,28
- I'm sorry I left you in the queue.
- I had a great time. Where's Mike ?


312
0:22:35,28 --> 0:22:37,52
- Where's Mike ?
- Where's Mike ?


313
0:22:37,52 --> 0:22:45,36
He's over there.


314
0:22:45,36 --> 0:23:19,12
<i>(Remix of A-Team theme tune)</i>


315
0:23:19,12 --> 0:23:47,56
<i>My work here is done,</i>


316
0:23:47,56 --> 0:23:50,36
Ooh, only for the, only for the


317
0:23:50,36 --> 0:23:53,0
Only for the hardcore UK raver


318
0:23:53,0 --> 0:23:54,76
Ba-ba-nyow-nyow-ne-ne


319
0:23:54,76 --> 0:23:57,4
Havin' it large, havin' it major,
havin' it large, havin' it major


320
0:23:57,4 --> 0:23:58,76
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh

 ? Rewind !  ?
