MALE SPEAKER: Sorry.


5
0:0:4,29 --> 0:0:5,54
ANTHONY PAPPALARDO: Stray.


6
0:0:5,54 --> 0:0:9,99



7
0:0:9,99 --> 0:0:10,8
MALE SPEAKER: Wait.


8
0:0:10,8 --> 0:0:11,55
What's your dog's name?


9
0:0:11,55 --> 0:0:13,33
ANTHONY PAPPALARDO: Stray.


10
0:0:13,33 --> 0:0:14,9
Stray.


11
0:0:14,9 --> 0:0:16,585
Like a lost dog.


12
0:0:16,585 --> 0:0:18,33
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, yeah.


13
0:0:18,33 --> 0:0:20,52
You got it at a shelter,
or something?


14
0:0:20,52 --> 0:0:21,79
ANTHONY PAPPALARDO: Yeah,
up in Harland.


15
0:0:21,79 --> 0:0:24,91
They just found her roaming
the streets.


16
0:0:24,91 --> 0:0:28,18
And just the typical dog story
you've heard a million times


17
0:0:28,18 --> 0:0:32,32
of just falling in love with the
dog in the fucking cage.


18
0:0:32,32 --> 0:0:33,41
So it was cool.


19
0:0:33,41 --> 0:0:36,96
I couldn't understand paying
some asshole $600 for a pure


20
0:0:36,96 --> 0:0:43,73
bred dog when there's so many
that could just be fucking


21
0:0:43,73 --> 0:0:46,12
helped or saved, or something.


22
0:0:46,12 --> 0:0:47,66
So, it worked out.


23
0:0:47,66 --> 0:0:48,84
It worked out.


24
0:0:48,84 --> 0:0:50,64
She just hangs out
in here, man.


25
0:0:50,64 --> 0:0:51,85
Little Stray.


26
0:0:51,85 --> 0:0:53,6
TED BARROW: Yeah, it
was a rescue dog.


27
0:0:53,6 --> 0:0:53,62
It was really nervous.


28
0:0:53,62 --> 0:0:57,35
Like, the only person it would
respond to was Pappalardo.


29
0:0:57,35 --> 0:1:0,6
Like, everyone else it would
bark or hide under the table.


30
0:1:0,6 --> 0:1:4,17
If you could find a dog that
reflects one aspect of his


31
0:1:4,17 --> 0:1:7,81
personality, he's loyal to his
friends, he's loyal to his


32
0:1:7,81 --> 0:1:11,84
family, he's a genuinely
nice person.


33
0:1:11,84 --> 0:1:14,1
He's not fake.

PATRICK O'DELL: Welcome
back to show.


36
0:1:21,0 --> 0:1:24,16
This episode was about
Anthony Pappalardo.


37
0:1:24,16 --> 0:1:26,85
Now, I didn't think that
would ever happen.


38
0:1:26,85 --> 0:1:29,87
I mean, people write in and they
request who they want a


39
0:1:29,87 --> 0:1:32,93
show on, and people say Anthony
a lot, and I always,


40
0:1:32,93 --> 0:1:35,28
like, psht, like
that'll happen.


41
0:1:35,28 --> 0:1:39,37
And when I filmed the Lakai
explosion day, I was like


42
0:1:39,37 --> 0:1:42,37
afraid to even point the camera
at him, because I don't


43
0:1:42,37 --> 0:1:44,66
know, I thought he'd get mad, or
be like, What's this corny


44
0:1:44,66 --> 0:1:46,98
show you do, or whatever.


45
0:1:46,98 --> 0:1:50,18
But for whatever reason he wrote
me back when I emailed


46
0:1:50,18 --> 0:1:52,26
him, and he said, Yeah
I'll do an episode.


47
0:1:52,26 --> 0:1:53,7
Come over.


48
0:1:53,7 --> 0:1:54,59
And maybe he didn't even
think it was going to


49
0:1:54,59 --> 0:1:55,73
be like a full episode.


50
0:1:55,73 --> 0:1:58,23
I think I kind of pitched it
like, I'm just going to ask


51
0:1:58,23 --> 0:2:0,72
you about Guy Mariano
really fast.


52
0:2:0,72 --> 0:2:4,8
And then I kept prodding, and I
was like, What about Mosaic?


53
0:2:4,8 --> 0:2:8,789
Anthony's done a lot
in his career.


54
0:2:8,789 --> 0:2:11,26
He's like a real skater's
skater.


55
0:2:11,26 --> 0:2:13,93
He's one of those people that
when you see a photo or you


56
0:2:13,93 --> 0:2:15,945
see a video clip, it
just stands out.


57
0:2:15,945 --> 0:2:28,18



58
0:2:28,18 --> 0:2:28,77
I don't know.


59
0:2:28,77 --> 0:2:30,22
I'm excited to have Anthony
on the show.


60
0:2:30,22 --> 0:2:33,16
And this may be the first time
he's ever been on a show.


61
0:2:33,16 --> 0:2:33,67
Here it is.


62
0:2:33,67 --> 0:2:36,92
A full blown Anthony
Pappalardo episode.


63
0:2:36,92 --> 0:2:38,78
I'm as shocked as you are.


64
0:2:38,78 --> 0:2:40,3
Welcome to the show.


65
0:2:40,3 --> 0:2:43,745



66
0:2:43,745 --> 0:2:45,75
ANTHONY PAPPALARDO: I'm not that
interesting of a dude,


67
0:2:45,75 --> 0:2:48,53
but it's the fact of because I
don't really do this stuff.


68
0:2:48,53 --> 0:2:50,23
But that's the thing
with pro skaters.


69
0:2:50,23 --> 0:2:53,81
A lot of them like to be in
front of this, and do this


70
0:2:53,81 --> 0:2:55,26
whole side of it.


71
0:2:55,26 --> 0:2:58,79
When you try to keep it personal
to a certain level,


72
0:2:58,79 --> 0:3:2,8
and you don't want to put
yourself really out there,


73
0:3:2,8 --> 0:3:7,49
that doesn't really give
people what they want.


74
0:3:7,49 --> 0:3:10,5
Automatically it turns into a
falseness that they have to


75
0:3:10,5 --> 0:3:15,21
create, because there's nothing
out there for them to


76
0:3:15,21 --> 0:3:17,602
kind of pick apart at.


77
0:3:17,602 --> 0:3:22,9
You know, I'll put out a video
every two, three years.


78
0:3:22,9 --> 0:3:22,83
I hope you like it.


79
0:3:22,83 --> 0:3:23,82
If you do, you do.


80
0:3:23,82 --> 0:3:24,6
If you don't, you don't.


81
0:3:24,6 --> 0:3:29,94
And I think that's maybe
how I was taught.


82
0:3:29,94 --> 0:3:33,75
When I was young and I used to
look up to Mike or Rick or,


83
0:3:33,75 --> 0:3:36,39
like, Fred Gall, I
didn't know one


84
0:3:36,39 --> 0:3:37,91
personal thing about Freddie.


85
0:3:37,91 --> 0:3:38,37
You know what I mean?


86
0:3:38,37 --> 0:3:40,24
I think that's how
it should be.


87
0:3:40,24 --> 0:3:45,41



88
0:3:45,41 --> 0:3:49,615
I don't think I ever thought
or wanted to be like, all


89
0:3:49,615 --> 0:3:52,26
right this is it, I want
to be a pro skater.


90
0:3:52,26 --> 0:3:53,82
I think that's an east
coast thing.


91
0:3:53,82 --> 0:3:59,296
I think I just kind of fell
into it, more or less.


92
0:3:59,296 --> 0:4:1,476
There you are.


93
0:4:1,476 --> 0:4:3,1
MALE SPEAKER: Here
are your boards.


94
0:4:3,1 --> 0:4:5,65
ANTHONY PAPPALARDO: Yeah, I got
two boards that I feel are


95
0:4:5,65 --> 0:4:7,85
kind of fitting for
a kitchen, maybe.


96
0:4:7,85 --> 0:4:8,62
MALE SPEAKER: Oh wait.


97
0:4:8,62 --> 0:4:10,15
Don't you have pizza
in your family?


98
0:4:10,15 --> 0:4:14,186
ANTHONY PAPPALARDO: Yeah, my
dad owns a pizza store.


99
0:4:14,186 --> 0:4:16,128
So that's hat.


100
0:4:16,128 --> 0:4:18,756
MALE SPEAKER: You and the
Fully Flared poster.


101
0:4:18,756 --> 0:4:21,329
ANTHONY PAPPALARDO: Oh yeah,
my mom took that photo.


102
0:4:21,329 --> 0:4:21,86
I don't know.


103
0:4:21,86 --> 0:4:24,44
It was my first actual skate
premiere I ever went to.


104
0:4:24,44 --> 0:4:28,28
I went to like an Alien one in
Ohio for Mosaic that was kind


105
0:4:28,28 --> 0:4:29,49
of like a half-assed one.


106
0:4:29,49 --> 0:4:32,2
But this was, I guess, my
first pretty big one.


107
0:4:32,2 --> 0:4:33,55
Just kind of hung
out with them in


108
0:4:33,55 --> 0:4:35,9
kind of a little disguise.


109
0:4:35,9 --> 0:4:38,61
I didn't really get noticed
too much, which was a good


110
0:4:38,61 --> 0:4:39,84
thing, I think.


111
0:4:39,84 --> 0:4:41,88
You know, I think I lucked out,
because I didn't know


112
0:4:41,88 --> 0:4:45,43
anything really about the video,
so I wasn't expecting


113
0:4:45,43 --> 0:4:48,88
my part to be second,
or something.


114
0:4:48,88 --> 0:4:51,5
Like I had no idea what
order or anything.


115
0:4:51,5 --> 0:4:55,7
So by the time my part was on
it was pretty much done.


116
0:4:55,7 --> 0:4:57,42
MALE SPEAKER: Well, I remember
watching right after Fully


117
0:4:57,42 --> 0:5:0,46
Flared some indie video on the
internet, and I was like, Oh


118
0:5:0,46 --> 0:5:1,99
yeah, like, you know
what I mean?


119
0:5:1,99 --> 0:5:2,9
There's still this.


120
0:5:2,9 --> 0:5:4,53
There's still so much
to skating.


121
0:5:4,53 --> 0:5:5,77
ANTHONY PAPPALARDO:
So much, man.


122
0:5:5,77 --> 0:5:9,67
And to put out a video to say
that it would, like, be the


123
0:5:9,67 --> 0:5:12,6
end and all of skating, you'd
have to be a pretty unoriginal


124
0:5:12,6 --> 0:5:14,35
person to think that.


125
0:5:14,35 --> 0:5:15,53
You know what I mean?


126
0:5:15,53 --> 0:5:18,19
You'd have to be like--


127
0:5:18,19 --> 0:5:21,3
fuck, I would hate
to, you know--


128
0:5:21,3 --> 0:5:23,7
And there was like when
[INAUDIBLE] did that video,


129
0:5:23,7 --> 0:5:24,41
Manic [INAUDIBLE].


130
0:5:24,41 --> 0:5:27,39
Like people were like,
Oh my God.


131
0:5:27,39 --> 0:5:31,28
Like a month later that
video sucked.


132
0:5:31,28 --> 0:5:33,84
Obviously the idea that they
were doing the Lakai video,


133
0:5:33,84 --> 0:5:35,95
and they started getting pretty
serious and they were


134
0:5:35,95 --> 0:5:37,72
doing trips and stuff.


135
0:5:37,72 --> 0:5:40,8
These guys were going to have
parts, like Guy Mariano, or


136
0:5:40,8 --> 0:5:47,3
like Mark, and all these guys,
and Carroll, and I just felt


137
0:5:47,3 --> 0:5:48,57
like I just couldn't really--


138
0:5:48,57 --> 0:5:48,98
I don't know.


139
0:5:48,98 --> 0:5:54,2
So I just came up with the idea
of just trying to stay


140
0:5:54,2 --> 0:5:57,56
home and film around New York.


141
0:5:57,56 --> 0:6:1,23
If you watch the video from the
beginning to the and, like


142
0:6:1,23 --> 0:6:3,45
my part, I just wanted
it to look different


143
0:6:3,45 --> 0:6:4,6
than everyone else's.


144
0:6:4,6 --> 0:6:6,43
Not better, not worse.


145
0:6:6,43 --> 0:6:8,38
Just kind of different.


146
0:6:8,38 --> 0:6:12,11
I wasn't trying to change
skateboarding with my part.


147
0:6:12,11 --> 0:6:16,2
I did a lot of basic stuff in
my part, like Smith grinds,


148
0:6:16,2 --> 0:6:17,73
and grinds, and ollies,
and stuff.


149
0:6:17,73 --> 0:6:23,65
But I just want to make a part
where I'll watch it and be


150
0:6:23,65 --> 0:6:26,99
kind of psyched on it in
10 years or something.


151
0:6:26,99 --> 0:6:30,99
I think skating's so fucked, is
like, how good everyone is.


152
0:6:30,99 --> 0:6:33,42
Like, why not do something
like that.


153
0:6:33,42 --> 0:6:35,83
It's just like everyone's good
at skateboarding now.


154
0:6:35,83 --> 0:6:39,55
And it's just hard to break
apart from that.


155
0:6:39,55 --> 0:6:42,84
TY EVANS: You know what's funny,
is like Paps, the whole


156
0:6:42,84 --> 0:6:47,62
time we were making this video
he told me, Hey, I kind of got


157
0:6:47,62 --> 0:6:49,16
this idea I'm going for.


158
0:6:49,16 --> 0:6:51,4
And it's going to be
just raw New York


159
0:6:51,4 --> 0:6:53,7
vibe skating at night.


160
0:6:53,7 --> 0:6:54,66
Like early hocus pocus.


161
0:6:54,66 --> 0:6:55,73
That's what he kept
calling it.


162
0:6:55,73 --> 0:6:58,63
BILL STROBECK: I feel like the
video is so gung ho, and


163
0:6:58,63 --> 0:7:0,78
everyone was so fucking, like,
Whoa, we've got to get this


164
0:7:0,78 --> 0:7:2,5
thing, we've go to do this.


165
0:7:2,5 --> 0:7:5,89
I feel like we just did
the complete opposite.


166
0:7:5,89 --> 0:7:7,38
I feel like it was
fun, you know?


167
0:7:7,38 --> 0:7:11,24
Which is cool, because you do
something so long, like the


168
0:7:11,24 --> 0:7:12,78
fun part leaves, you know?


169
0:7:12,78 --> 0:7:14,801
We just wanted to do it
how they used to do


170
0:7:14,801 --> 0:7:16,86
it back in the day.


171
0:7:16,86 --> 0:7:18,3
In like video days.


172
0:7:18,3 --> 0:7:19,98
You just film what you film.


173
0:7:19,98 --> 0:7:21,9
It shows the time, you
know what I mean?


174
0:7:21,9 --> 0:7:23,58
I thought he did a lot of
hard shit in his part.


175
0:7:23,58 --> 0:7:24,67
I thought it was great.


176
0:7:24,67 --> 0:7:25,56
I think it's great.


177
0:7:25,56 --> 0:7:27,225
The only thing that I didn't
think was great was that he


178
0:7:27,225 --> 0:7:28,62
was in Times Square
in his part.


179
0:7:28,62 --> 0:7:29,89
I thought that was stupid.


180
0:7:29,89 --> 0:7:34,38
I know for a fact that he would
never be in Times Square


181
0:7:34,38 --> 0:7:35,46
walking around.


182
0:7:35,46 --> 0:7:37,275
It was a little weird.


183
0:7:37,275 --> 0:7:39,2
ANTHONY PAPPALARDO: We'll
just go skate.


184
0:7:39,2 --> 0:7:41,85
I'll call him up, cruise around
for a couple hours, and


185
0:7:41,85 --> 0:7:45,43
then maybe not speak to him
for a week or something.


186
0:7:45,43 --> 0:7:49,4
Like there's never been like,
All right, well, let's meet up


187
0:7:49,4 --> 0:7:50,6
tomorrow to film that.


188
0:7:50,6 --> 0:7:51,1
I don't know.


189
0:7:51,1 --> 0:7:53,3
It's just always on a whim.


190
0:7:53,3 --> 0:7:55,796
Especially for that
Lakai video.


191
0:7:55,796 --> 0:7:58,3
It was nothing more than having
a couple of beers or


192
0:7:58,3 --> 0:8:1,63
something, and like, Hey, let's
just go put the camera


193
0:8:1,63 --> 0:8:2,54
light on and go skate.


194
0:8:2,54 --> 0:8:3,81
And that's what it was.


195
0:8:3,81 --> 0:8:6,64
It was that for a couple nights,
and then it was not


196
0:8:6,64 --> 0:8:9,68
that for a very long time.


197
0:8:9,68 --> 0:8:13,17
The level of some of the stuff
that I had on film, a lot of


198
0:8:13,17 --> 0:8:16,46
people could do it,
I would say.


199
0:8:16,46 --> 0:8:18,41
You guys are all kind
of in this video.


200
0:8:18,41 --> 0:8:21,45
So it's like I guess has to be
some level of skating that


201
0:8:21,45 --> 0:8:23,15
makes or breaks the cut.


202
0:8:23,15 --> 0:8:24,97
MALE SPEAKER: Did you have lot
of stuff filmed that wasn't


203
0:8:24,97 --> 0:8:27,196
going to go in or
didn't go in?


204
0:8:27,196 --> 0:8:29,19
ANTHONY PAPPALARDO:
Yeah I think so.


205
0:8:29,19 --> 0:8:33,265
I had some other footage that
wasn't in that video part.


206
0:8:33,265 --> 0:8:36,32
BILL STROBECK: I had all this
left over footage that Ty


207
0:8:36,32 --> 0:8:37,57
didn't use.


208
0:8:37,57 --> 0:8:39,6



209
0:8:39,6 --> 0:8:40,85
I didn't want it
to go to waste.


210
0:8:40,85 --> 0:8:44,1



211
0:8:44,1 --> 0:8:47,97
The beginning part was Anthony
talking to this guy.


212
0:8:47,97 --> 0:8:49,39
Like I didn't even send
that to them.


213
0:8:49,39 --> 0:8:52,62
Like, I knew I was going to
do something with it.


214
0:8:52,62 --> 0:8:54,96
It was kind of like, Oh,
I'm going to use this.


215
0:8:54,96 --> 0:8:56,32
I'm not giving this to anyone.


216
0:8:56,32 --> 0:8:58,78
Because I thought
it was awesome.


217
0:8:58,78 --> 0:9:0,32
MALE SPEAKER: Want some food?


218
0:9:0,32 --> 0:9:1,373
I'll feed all you
guys right now.


219
0:9:1,373 --> 0:9:1,866
Right there.


220
0:9:1,866 --> 0:9:3,345
BK.


221
0:9:3,345 --> 0:9:5,81
ANTHONY PAPPALARDO: OK,
thanks for the offer.


222
0:9:5,81 --> 0:9:6,303
Thank you.


223
0:9:6,303 --> 0:9:8,146
MALE SPEAKER: Don't let the
motherfucker bullshit you.


224
0:9:8,146 --> 0:9:9,396
Proof is in the pudding.


225
0:9:9,396 --> 0:9:12,436



226
0:9:12,436 --> 0:9:16,9
BILL STROBECK: It's Anthony,
and little Alex.


227
0:9:16,9 --> 0:9:19,6
Alex Olson.


228
0:9:19,6 --> 0:9:21,63
And this kid Goose that
I grew up with.


229
0:9:21,63 --> 0:9:22,1
You know.


230
0:9:22,1 --> 0:9:23,46
It was like, I'm putting
everyone in there.


231
0:9:23,46 --> 0:9:24,17
Fuck this, you know?


232
0:9:24,17 --> 0:9:25,235
It's cool.


233
0:9:25,235 --> 0:9:29,84
I'll tell you right now, he
skates in New York a lot.


234
0:9:29,84 --> 0:9:33,4
New York you're just not going
to get as much footage.


235
0:9:33,4 --> 0:9:34,476
It's different, dude.


236
0:9:34,476 --> 0:9:36,17
I didn't bring any equipment
with me.


237
0:9:36,17 --> 0:9:37,62
Like, no one has
a camera light.


238
0:9:37,62 --> 0:9:38,86
No one has a camera light.


239
0:9:38,86 --> 0:9:39,49
You know what I mean?


240
0:9:39,49 --> 0:9:40,15
It was, like, generator.


241
0:9:40,15 --> 0:9:40,9
You can't do generators.


242
0:9:40,9 --> 0:9:43,32
It's way different, man.


243
0:9:43,32 --> 0:9:45,72
I think Anthony's just kind of
like trying to stick out.


244
0:9:45,72 --> 0:9:49,43
I think that's what keeps it
going for him, you know?


245
0:9:49,43 --> 0:9:51,98
You can't keep doing the same
thing or it gets boring.


246
0:9:51,98 --> 0:9:54,1
He just wants to keep
reinventing himself.


247
0:9:54,1 --> 0:9:55,597
I think that's cool.


248
0:9:55,597 --> 0:9:58,591



249
0:9:58,591 --> 0:10:0,21
MALE SPEAKER: What do
you think of that?


250
0:10:0,21 --> 0:10:2,52
MALE SPEAKER: I said, Man, that
was mad beautiful, man.


251
0:10:2,52 --> 0:10:7,353
That motherfucker came up and
over, and then came and


252
0:10:7,353 --> 0:10:8,89
flipped out and came down--


253
0:10:8,89 --> 0:10:9,63
BILL STROBECK (OFFSCREEN):
That guy's awesome.


254
0:10:9,63 --> 0:10:10,66
I see him all the time.


255
0:10:10,66 --> 0:10:11,91
That guy rules.


256
0:10:11,91 --> 0:10:16,341



257
0:10:16,341 --> 0:10:18,17
ROB PLUHOWSKI: Hey,
Laila, they want


258
0:10:18,17 --> 0:10:20,333
you to come out here.


259
0:10:20,333 --> 0:10:21,83
MALE SPEAKER: What's
your name?


260
0:10:21,83 --> 0:10:22,83
LAILA: Laila.


261
0:10:22,83 --> 0:10:23,35
MALE SPEAKER: Hi Laila.


262
0:10:23,35 --> 0:10:24,3
Pleasure to meet you.


263
0:10:24,3 --> 0:10:27,13
Have you ever seen any
skateboard videos that your


264
0:10:27,13 --> 0:10:29,116
father's in?


265
0:10:29,116 --> 0:10:30,61
LAILA: I don't know?


266
0:10:30,61 --> 0:10:32,816
ROB PLUHOWSKI: We don't
let her see those.


267
0:10:32,816 --> 0:10:34,45
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Were you kicked off


268
0:10:34,45 --> 0:10:35,76
because you had a kid?


269
0:10:35,76 --> 0:10:36,87
ROB PLUHOWSKI: Oh, no.


270
0:10:36,87 --> 0:10:38,38
I wasn't going anywhere.


271
0:10:38,38 --> 0:10:39,5
I knew it.


272
0:10:39,5 --> 0:10:39,78
You know I mean?


273
0:10:39,78 --> 0:10:40,71
I was just in denial.


274
0:10:40,71 --> 0:10:42,91
You get to a point in
skateboarding where it's like


275
0:10:42,91 --> 0:10:44,57
that's all you do
is skateboard.


276
0:10:44,57 --> 0:10:45,54
You forget about a job.


277
0:10:45,54 --> 0:10:46,85
You forget that real
life happens.


278
0:10:46,85 --> 0:10:49,11
And things go on.


279
0:10:49,11 --> 0:10:51,37
When Joe Castrucci called me
up and kicked me off it was


280
0:10:51,37 --> 0:10:53,92
probably the best thing that's
ever happened to me.


281
0:10:53,92 --> 0:10:55,3
I needed to move on.


282
0:10:55,3 --> 0:10:57,73
I'm not the type of person
that was a career


283
0:10:57,73 --> 0:10:59,47
skateboarder, as you say.


284
0:10:59,47 --> 0:11:1,87
Maybe would say.


285
0:11:1,87 --> 0:11:3,27
I met Anthony in Philly.


286
0:11:3,27 --> 0:11:5,39
Probably I was barely 21.


287
0:11:5,39 --> 0:11:6,96
20, 21.


288
0:11:6,96 --> 0:11:8,98
If I go skateboarding tomorrow
he's the one


289
0:11:8,98 --> 0:11:9,706
I'm going to call.


290
0:11:9,706 --> 0:11:10,62
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Dude, look at that.


291
0:11:10,62 --> 0:11:12,656
He would've done it.


292
0:11:12,656 --> 0:11:15,22
ROB PLUHOWSKI: See, I haven't
really been, like, in the


293
0:11:15,22 --> 0:11:16,25
skateboard thing.


294
0:11:16,25 --> 0:11:21,21
Like when Lakai video came out,
from what I hear, Anthony


295
0:11:21,21 --> 0:11:24,9
didn't meet people's
expectations.


296
0:11:24,9 --> 0:11:25,885
People were talking shit
on it, and like his


297
0:11:25,885 --> 0:11:27,18
part wasn't all great.


298
0:11:27,18 --> 0:11:32,78
But he's done like the
hardest things.


299
0:11:32,78 --> 0:11:34,815
He just took a different path.


300
0:11:34,815 --> 0:11:39,28
He tried different stuff and
kind of put a twist on his


301
0:11:39,28 --> 0:11:40,29
skateboarding.


302
0:11:40,29 --> 0:11:42,97
People say he's being lazy or
whatnot, but Anthony can do


303
0:11:42,97 --> 0:11:45,6
anything he wants to
do on a skateboard.


304
0:11:45,6 --> 0:11:49,13
He is the most determined kid on
a skateboard ever I've ever


305
0:11:49,13 --> 0:11:50,1
personally met.


306
0:11:50,1 --> 0:11:51,79
One of the most determined
kids on a skateboard.


307
0:11:51,79 --> 0:11:56,334
He can do anything
he wants to do.


308
0:11:56,334 --> 0:11:58,88
TY EVANS: There's like that
section of skaters that are,


309
0:11:58,88 --> 0:12:5,21
like, so into Bobby Puleo, so
into Anthony Pappalardo, and


310
0:12:5,21 --> 0:12:8,3
Ricky Oyola, and they're so into
those really raw, city


311
0:12:8,3 --> 0:12:9,72
street skater guys.


312
0:12:9,72 --> 0:12:12,79
That's just a totally raw,
pure form of skating.


313
0:12:12,79 --> 0:12:15,18
Look at Pappalardo now compared
to Pappalardo before.


314
0:12:15,18 --> 0:12:17,37
They're two different
types of skaters.


315
0:12:17,37 --> 0:12:19,16
And they're both
equally as rad.


316
0:12:19,16 --> 0:12:20,72
You want to know how fucking
tech he was?


317
0:12:20,72 --> 0:12:22,7
He was getting into backside
flips, switchfronts like


318
0:12:22,7 --> 0:12:25,19
Crooks on DWP when
I first saw him.


319
0:12:25,19 --> 0:12:28,27
And I remember around that same
time was Photosynthesis


320
0:12:28,27 --> 0:12:29,45
where he did the [INAUDIBLE]


321
0:12:29,45 --> 0:12:31,625
180 fakie 5.0 across the whole
bench at the seaport.


322
0:12:31,625 --> 0:12:33,55
That's fucking gnarly.


323
0:12:33,55 --> 0:12:35,44
ANTHONY PAPPALARDO: There's
not one professional--


324
0:12:35,44 --> 0:12:37,15
or it doesn't even have
to be an issue of


325
0:12:37,15 --> 0:12:39,14
professional or not--


326
0:12:39,14 --> 0:12:42,18
skateboarder that hasn't changed
how they've skated


327
0:12:42,18 --> 0:12:51,57
since they were 15 to 30.


328
0:12:51,57 --> 0:12:56,5
Like any skateboarder I was just
so addicted to it at that


329
0:12:56,5 --> 0:12:58,885
age, it just consumed me.


330
0:12:58,885 --> 0:13:4,46
From 13 on there was a lot of
skating involved, and just


331
0:13:4,46 --> 0:13:7,26
watching skate videos,
to skating, to


332
0:13:7,26 --> 0:13:8,51
being in the city skating.


333
0:13:8,51 --> 0:13:12,67



334
0:13:12,67 --> 0:13:13,26
I don't know.


335
0:13:13,26 --> 0:13:18,58
It's like, any skater you talk
to, I think, will always have


336
0:13:18,58 --> 0:13:22,77
those couple of years, will
agree how it really does


337
0:13:22,77 --> 0:13:23,85
consume everything.


338
0:13:23,85 --> 0:13:28,21
And you miss out on, at that
time, it's like stupid shit--


339
0:13:28,21 --> 0:13:31,72
the high school parties, and all
that stuff, college, and I


340
0:13:31,72 --> 0:13:36,675
don't regret a minute of it, but
that doesn't even exist in


341
0:13:36,675 --> 0:13:37,925
your world.


342
0:13:37,925 --> 0:13:43,429



343
0:13:43,429 --> 0:13:45,45
BRIAN WENNING: I like how all
these people that don't even


344
0:13:45,45 --> 0:13:52,9
know him love how he is this Bob
Dylan type skateboarder,


345
0:13:52,9 --> 0:13:54,547
where he just does what he
wants, when he wants, and


346
0:13:54,547 --> 0:13:57,226
everybody loves him.


347
0:13:57,226 --> 0:13:59,18
I don't know him anymore.


348
0:13:59,18 --> 0:14:2,0
I know the guy that
he was back then.


349
0:14:2,0 --> 0:14:3,304
But everybody changes.


350
0:14:3,304 --> 0:14:7,75
I don't know the Anthony
Pappalardo of 2008 to 2009.


351
0:14:7,75 --> 0:14:9,726
I don't know what he's like.


352
0:14:9,726 --> 0:14:11,702
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): How
long has it been since you and


353
0:14:11,702 --> 0:14:12,196
Anthony talked?


354
0:14:12,196 --> 0:14:14,18
BRIAN WENNING: That's when
we were in competition.


355
0:14:14,18 --> 0:14:17,386
And I mean, I still skate the
same as I [INAUDIBLE]


356
0:14:17,386 --> 0:14:19,318
forgot about him.


357
0:14:19,318 --> 0:14:20,284
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): This
is like the original


358
0:14:20,284 --> 0:14:22,216
battleground spot for
you and Anthony?


359
0:14:22,216 --> 0:14:23,665
BRIAN WENNING: Right here?


360
0:14:23,665 --> 0:14:26,9
Yeah, right here, this is
where it all happened.


361
0:14:26,9 --> 0:14:28,668
First day we met he was trying
to kick from the stairs, and I


362
0:14:28,668 --> 0:14:30,96
was like, No, man.


363
0:14:30,96 --> 0:14:33,668
Can't let this happen.


364
0:14:33,668 --> 0:14:35,52
And then I did it before him and
then after that we hated


365
0:14:35,52 --> 0:14:39,518
each other, and then we
became best friends.


366
0:14:39,518 --> 0:14:42,47
MALE SPEAKERS (OFFSCREEN):
Whoaa!


367
0:14:42,47 --> 0:14:43,454
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Back to back.


368
0:14:43,454 --> 0:14:45,422
Back to back.


369
0:14:45,422 --> 0:14:46,672
MALE SPEAKERS (OFFSCREEN):
Ohhh!


370
0:14:46,672 --> 0:14:57,23



371
0:14:57,23 --> 0:15:0,3
ANTHONY PAPPALARDO: Yeah,
we skated a bunch, man.


372
0:15:0,3 --> 0:15:4,73
We would just meet up in New
York, downtown, and fucking


373
0:15:4,73 --> 0:15:10,55
jump down the bank steps all
day, and just be some fucking


374
0:15:10,55 --> 0:15:15,385
weirdos, little suburb kids in
the city getting away with it.


375
0:15:15,385 --> 0:15:18,11



376
0:15:18,11 --> 0:15:19,76
MALE SPEAKER: You can't
skate here.


377
0:15:19,76 --> 0:15:21,23
It's private property.


378
0:15:21,23 --> 0:15:21,94
get that?


379
0:15:21,94 --> 0:15:23,5
Understand that in your head?


380
0:15:23,5 --> 0:15:25,94
Private property.


381
0:15:25,94 --> 0:15:29,319
P-R-I-V-A-T-E.


382
0:15:29,319 --> 0:15:30,798
MALE SPEAKER: What are you going
to do if I come back?


383
0:15:30,798 --> 0:15:33,44
MALE SPEAKER: Fuck you up.


384
0:15:33,44 --> 0:15:33,895
And you.


385
0:15:33,895 --> 0:15:34,946
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Me?


386
0:15:34,946 --> 0:15:35,68
MALE SPEAKER: Think
I'm laughing?


387
0:15:35,68 --> 0:15:36,33
Think I'm joking?


388
0:15:36,33 --> 0:15:37,47
Come back here tonight.


389
0:15:37,47 --> 0:15:38,6
MALE SPEAKER: You
can't hit him.


390
0:15:38,6 --> 0:15:38,86
He's 16 years old.


391
0:15:38,86 --> 0:15:41,34
MALE SPEAKER: I don't give
a fuck if you was two.


392
0:15:41,34 --> 0:15:43,58
Come back here tonight
and see what happens.


393
0:15:43,58 --> 0:15:44,56
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
All right.


394
0:15:44,56 --> 0:15:45,17
I'll be here.


395
0:15:45,17 --> 0:15:45,83
I'll be here.


396
0:15:45,83 --> 0:15:47,1
I'll fucking be here.


397
0:15:47,1 --> 0:15:47,9
MALE SPEAKER: I hope so.


398
0:15:47,9 --> 0:15:50,52
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
I hope so too.


399
0:15:50,52 --> 0:15:52,13
I'll be here tonight.


400
0:15:52,13 --> 0:15:53,74
All right, I'll see
you tonight.


401
0:15:53,74 --> 0:15:55,14
I'll see you, bro.


402
0:15:55,14 --> 0:15:56,35
Have your boxing gloves ready.


403
0:15:56,35 --> 0:15:57,682
I'll be back.


404
0:15:57,682 --> 0:16:0,32
BILL STROBECK: I mean, when I
first started film them it was


405
0:16:0,32 --> 0:16:1,54
for Photosynthesis.


406
0:16:1,54 --> 0:16:5,62
Well, the first person that I
was filming was Josh Kalis,


407
0:16:5,62 --> 0:16:7,75
because he was just local.


408
0:16:7,75 --> 0:16:11,645
Then I call from Joe Castrucci
a month later.


409
0:16:11,645 --> 0:16:13,77
He was like, Dude,
you want to film?


410
0:16:13,77 --> 0:16:15,31
We can hook you up
with some dough.


411
0:16:15,31 --> 0:16:16,45
I was like, Sure.


412
0:16:16,45 --> 0:16:19,78
I got all the numbers to
everyone right away, and the


413
0:16:19,78 --> 0:16:21,41
first person I called
was Anthony.


414
0:16:21,41 --> 0:16:22,62
And I was kind of nervous.


415
0:16:22,62 --> 0:16:25,635
It was weird, because I
didn't know anyone.


416
0:16:25,635 --> 0:16:30,28
I mean, I knew Josh, and stuff,
but I didn't know


417
0:16:30,28 --> 0:16:31,5
Anthony when I called him.


418
0:16:31,5 --> 0:16:34,34
I was like, Dude, what's up?


419
0:16:34,34 --> 0:16:34,57
I'm Bill.


420
0:16:34,57 --> 0:16:36,38
I got a job.


421
0:16:36,38 --> 0:16:41,65
I was like, Let's meet up.


422
0:16:41,65 --> 0:16:45,45
He was, like, Dude, I'll be at
the seaport at like 8:00 in


423
0:16:45,45 --> 0:16:46,365
the morning.


424
0:16:46,365 --> 0:16:47,85
MALE SPEAKER: (OFFSCREEN):
Yeah!


425
0:16:47,85 --> 0:16:51,61
BILL STROBECK: I took a
Greyhound and met him up here.


426
0:16:51,61 --> 0:16:53,25
It was just me and him.


427
0:16:53,25 --> 0:16:56,221
And then Wenning showed
up an hour later.


428
0:16:56,221 --> 0:16:57,985
We filmed a line
that first day.


429
0:16:57,985 --> 0:16:59,235
Like right off the bat.


430
0:16:59,235 --> 0:17:15,765



431
0:17:15,765 --> 0:17:17,943
MALE SPEAKER: These used to be
the benches that you see in


432
0:17:17,943 --> 0:17:19,25
the Photosynthesis
video right here.


433
0:17:19,25 --> 0:17:22,42



434
0:17:22,42 --> 0:17:26,589
Anthony slept on this one, and
then I slept on this one.


435
0:17:26,589 --> 0:17:31,15
And we woke up with bums going
through our pockets and stuff.


436
0:17:31,15 --> 0:17:33,3
Pretty much slept like a
half hour, probably.


437
0:17:33,3 --> 0:17:36,5
And then he got up and nollied
180 at the big rail at the


438
0:17:36,5 --> 0:17:37,3
Brooklyn banks in the Alien
Workshop video.


439
0:17:37,3 --> 0:17:56,15



440
0:17:56,15 --> 0:17:57,5
ANTHONY PAPPALARDO: No,
that was kind of wack.


441
0:17:57,5 --> 0:17:58,3
I don't know about that.


442
0:17:58,3 --> 0:18:1,25



443
0:18:1,25 --> 0:18:2,45
Dude, I don't know.


444
0:18:2,45 --> 0:18:3,7
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Let me keep it.


445
0:18:3,7 --> 0:20:3,7
