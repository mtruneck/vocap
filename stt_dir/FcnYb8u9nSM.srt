0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:1,96



2
0:0:1,96 --> 0:0:3,16
FELICIA: Hello everybody.


3
0:0:3,16 --> 0:0:4,85
I believe that we are live.


4
0:0:4,85 --> 0:0:7,92
This is Vaginal Fantasy
Book Club.


5
0:0:7,92 --> 0:0:12,88
It is a romance book club that
I have with my co-hosts here


6
0:0:12,88 --> 0:0:15,26
who are in order,
Bonnie Burton.


7
0:0:15,26 --> 0:0:16,62
BONNIE: Hello.


8
0:0:16,62 --> 0:0:18,19
FELICIA: Kiala Kasebee.


9
0:0:18,19 --> 0:0:20,46
KIALA: Hello.


10
0:0:20,46 --> 0:0:21,43
FELICIA: Veronica Belmont.


11
0:0:21,43 --> 0:0:22,54
VERONICA: Hello.


12
0:0:22,54 --> 0:0:24,53
FELICIA: And me, Felicia Day.


13
0:0:24,53 --> 0:0:27,23
Monthly we have a different book
and a different alt book


14
0:0:27,23 --> 0:0:27,9
that we discuss.


15
0:0:27,9 --> 0:0:30,75
And we talk about just general
things as well


16
0:0:30,75 --> 0:0:32,27
that are on our forums.


17
0:0:32,27 --> 0:0:35,4
We have a group on
goodreads.com.


18
0:0:35,4 --> 0:0:38,0
And it's under Vaginal Fantasy
so just search there and you


19
0:0:38,0 --> 0:0:41,37
can join in on the discussion
during the month around the


20
0:0:41,37 --> 0:0:42,69
books that we're reading.


21
0:0:42,69 --> 0:0:46,17
Before we get into the book this
month, which was Succubus


22
0:0:46,17 --> 0:0:48,86
Blues, how's was everybody's
holiday?


23
0:0:48,86 --> 0:0:50,39
BONNIE: First of all,
you have to mention


24
0:0:50,39 --> 0:0:51,9
we're all in our pajamas.


25
0:0:51,9 --> 0:0:53,13
FELICIA: Oh yeah.


26
0:0:53,13 --> 0:0:55,59
And I don't even understand
how that happened.


27
0:0:55,59 --> 0:0:56,7
BONNIE: That's my fault.


28
0:0:56,7 --> 0:1:4,26
Because it's a Sunday and on
Sundays I get up late gamer


29
0:1:4,26 --> 0:1:8,54
style like at around one
and then walk my dog.


30
0:1:8,54 --> 0:1:11,2
And then get back into my pj's
and spend the entire day


31
0:1:11,2 --> 0:1:11,63
reading comics.


32
0:1:11,63 --> 0:1:14,376
VERONICA: Your dog lets
you wake up at one?


33
0:1:14,376 --> 0:1:15,58
BONNIE: My dog is awesome.


34
0:1:15,58 --> 0:1:18,22
Sophie has a snooze button.


35
0:1:18,22 --> 0:1:19,12
VERONICA: Oh my God.


36
0:1:19,12 --> 0:1:21,56
KIALA: Well I just never
get out of my pajamas.


37
0:1:21,56 --> 0:1:24,315
But these are fancier pajamas
that I got for Christmas.


38
0:1:24,315 --> 0:1:24,66
BONNIE: They are.


39
0:1:24,66 --> 0:1:26,9
Are those silk?


40
0:1:26,9 --> 0:1:27,56
KIALA: Yeah, or something.


41
0:1:27,56 --> 0:1:28,81
They're silky.


42
0:1:28,81 --> 0:1:30,56



43
0:1:30,56 --> 0:1:32,97
FELICIA: Was that the best
present that you got?


44
0:1:32,97 --> 0:1:36,21
KIALA: No, I think this was the
best present that I got.


45
0:1:36,21 --> 0:1:37,91
BONNIE: Aw.


46
0:1:37,91 --> 0:1:38,4
VERONICA: That's cute.


47
0:1:38,4 --> 0:1:40,81
KIALA: It's a Squishable and
it's limited edition.


48
0:1:40,81 --> 0:1:43,41
And it's like 35 out of 1,000.


49
0:1:43,41 --> 0:1:47,97
And I named her Anna
Kareninamonk, because I've


50
0:1:47,97 --> 0:1:50,626
been watching Anna
Karenina a lot.


51
0:1:50,626 --> 0:1:52,26
I love her.


52
0:1:52,26 --> 0:1:53,405
BONNIE: Do you want
to see what I


53
0:1:53,405 --> 0:1:56,68
got myself for Christmas?


54
0:1:56,68 --> 0:1:58,16
FELICIA: Is that the favorite
thing you got for Christmas


55
0:1:58,16 --> 0:1:59,55
that's saying something
about yourself?


56
0:1:59,55 --> 0:2:1,48
BONNIE: I got a dead bat.


57
0:2:1,48 --> 0:2:3,59
VERONICA: Whoa, hey, dead bat.


58
0:2:3,59 --> 0:2:4,16
That's a dead bat.


59
0:2:4,16 --> 0:2:5,14
BONNIE: It's a dead bat.


60
0:2:5,14 --> 0:2:5,955
VERONICA: That's nice.


61
0:2:5,955 --> 0:2:6,55
BONNIE: Thanks a lot.


62
0:2:6,55 --> 0:2:9,8
It's for my taxidermy
collection.


63
0:2:9,8 --> 0:2:9,87
FELICIA: Where do you go to get


64
0:2:9,87 --> 0:2:11,3
something like that Bonnie?


65
0:2:11,3 --> 0:2:14,4
BONNIE: Believe in or not, San
Francisco has two whimsical


66
0:2:14,4 --> 0:2:15,42
taxidermy stores.


67
0:2:15,42 --> 0:2:18,15
One's called Love To Death which
is on Oddities, which


68
0:2:18,15 --> 0:2:20,5
you can watch the TV
show Oddities.


69
0:2:20,5 --> 0:2:22,26
And the other one's called
Paxton Gate and it's in the


70
0:2:22,26 --> 0:2:23,82
[INAUDIBLE].


71
0:2:23,82 --> 0:2:26,6
I'm like Norm at both of them.


72
0:2:26,6 --> 0:2:28,622
They know me on a first
name basis.


73
0:2:28,622 --> 0:2:31,375
Because I have a lot of
taxidermy in my house, which


74
0:2:31,375 --> 0:2:34,72
probably explains why I'm
going to die alone.


75
0:2:34,72 --> 0:2:37,9
KIALA: Paxton Gate's the one
right by the McSweeney store,


76
0:2:37,9 --> 0:2:37,72
the pirate store, right?


77
0:2:37,72 --> 0:2:38,95
BONNIE: Yeah, it's right next
to McSweeney's store.


78
0:2:38,95 --> 0:2:40,81
KIALA: And Borderlands
on that same--


79
0:2:40,81 --> 0:2:41,79
FELICIA: That sounds like
a fun place to visit.


80
0:2:41,79 --> 0:2:44,62
VERONICA: On the most
awesome block ever.


81
0:2:44,62 --> 0:2:46,82
KIALA: Yeah it's the
best block and it's


82
0:2:46,82 --> 0:2:47,56
just an amazing store.


83
0:2:47,56 --> 0:2:49,8
BONNIE: Yeah Felicia next time
you come visit, and Kiala, we


84
0:2:49,8 --> 0:2:52,881
have to do a little trip.


85
0:2:52,881 --> 0:2:54,43
KIALA: That's my favorite area,


86
0:2:54,43 --> 0:2:56,15
Valencia, that whole area.


87
0:2:56,15 --> 0:2:58,64
BONNIE: Veronica, yeah, you
know that area well too.


88
0:2:58,64 --> 0:2:59,36
VERONICA: Definitely.


89
0:2:59,36 --> 0:3:0,58
BONNIE: Everybody knows
that place.


90
0:3:0,58 --> 0:3:2,79
FELICIA: Veronica you got
something for Christmas that


91
0:3:2,79 --> 0:3:4,8
you should bring in the room.


92
0:3:4,8 --> 0:3:4,505
BONNIE: Yes.


93
0:3:4,505 --> 0:3:7,32
VERONICA: I can't bring it
in the room but hold on.


94
0:3:7,32 --> 0:3:9,24
Let me show you the thing.


95
0:3:9,24 --> 0:3:10,26
Hold on, let's see.


96
0:3:10,26 --> 0:3:10,91
FELICIA: You've got
to bring that in.


97
0:3:10,91 --> 0:3:12,39
VERONICA: Let me get inception
for a second.


98
0:3:12,39 --> 0:3:13,515
Can you see it?


99
0:3:13,515 --> 0:3:13,88
FELICIA: Aw.


100
0:3:13,88 --> 0:3:15,25
Oh my gosh.


101
0:3:15,25 --> 0:3:17,2
VERONICA: That is Liberty.


102
0:3:17,2 --> 0:3:19,6
BONNIE: Why aren't you tweeting
the puppy more?


103
0:3:19,6 --> 0:3:21,86
VERONICA: I'm trying to,
although I'm so busy half the


104
0:3:21,86 --> 0:3:25,56
time trying to get her to not
destroy me that it's kind of


105
0:3:25,56 --> 0:3:26,38
difficult to.


106
0:3:26,38 --> 0:3:26,945
She's a biter.


107
0:3:26,945 --> 0:3:29,5
She's a little bit of a biter.


108
0:3:29,5 --> 0:3:30,5
So she's great though.


109
0:3:30,5 --> 0:3:32,5
She's a guide dog puppy that
we're raising until she's


110
0:3:32,5 --> 0:3:34,34
around 15 months if all goes
according to plan.


111
0:3:34,34 --> 0:3:37,37
And then when she's 15 months
she'll hopefully go to guide


112
0:3:37,37 --> 0:3:40,11
dog puppy college and help
out a blind person.


113
0:3:40,11 --> 0:3:41,4
BONNIE: Aw.


114
0:3:41,4 --> 0:3:43,81
FELICIA: That's beautiful, but
I would never be able to let


115
0:3:43,81 --> 0:3:44,74
my puppy go.


116
0:3:44,74 --> 0:3:45,72
KIALA: That's going
to be hard.


117
0:3:45,72 --> 0:3:46,67
FELICIA: That's going to
be horrible, dude.


118
0:3:46,67 --> 0:3:49,496
VERONICA: She's a lot of work
so we'll see how that goes.


119
0:3:49,496 --> 0:3:50,96
FELICIA: I told you dogs
were not easy.


120
0:3:50,96 --> 0:3:52,33
They'll come up to me
and look at you


121
0:3:52,33 --> 0:3:53,53
like, let's do something.


122
0:3:53,53 --> 0:3:54,37
And you just--


123
0:3:54,37 --> 0:3:55,76
what do you want from me?


124
0:3:55,76 --> 0:3:58,46
BONNIE: I don't know but
my dog's pretty cool.


125
0:3:58,46 --> 0:3:59,72
She's asleep right now.


126
0:3:59,72 --> 0:4:3,13
VERONICA: Well the hard part is
by the time they get really


127
0:4:3,13 --> 0:4:6,5
well trained and kind of chill
and you can take them


128
0:4:6,5 --> 0:4:8,6
everywhere is when you have
to give them away.


129
0:4:8,6 --> 0:4:11,75
So by the time you get to that
perfect point you're like, OK.


130
0:4:11,75 --> 0:4:14,4
Go out into the world.


131
0:4:14,4 --> 0:4:16,299
BONNIE: It's almost
like dating.


132
0:4:16,299 --> 0:4:18,67
As soon as they're awesome,
they leave.


133
0:4:18,67 --> 0:4:19,215
VERONICA: Yeah.


134
0:4:19,215 --> 0:4:21,4
KIALA: I'm opening this because
I can't stand--


135
0:4:21,4 --> 0:4:22,82
FELICIA: Oh yeah, what are
we drinking today?


136
0:4:22,82 --> 0:4:24,38
VERONICA: Hot Toddy.


137
0:4:24,38 --> 0:4:26,93
FELICIA: What's in a Hot Toddy
Veronica, for people who


138
0:4:26,93 --> 0:4:27,11
aren't familiar?


139
0:4:27,11 --> 0:4:29,7
VERONICA: I'm using Bulleit
bourbon, also


140
0:4:29,7 --> 0:4:31,8
honey, lemon, and tea.


141
0:4:31,8 --> 0:4:32,18
FELICIA: Nice.


142
0:4:32,18 --> 0:4:34,45
VERONICA: My little tea
plant from Adagio.


143
0:4:34,45 --> 0:4:35,84
FELICIA: What are you
doing, Bonnie?


144
0:4:35,84 --> 0:4:37,73
BONNIE: I'm drinking,
in my Batman


145
0:4:37,73 --> 0:4:40,435
glass, coffee and Kahlua.


146
0:4:40,435 --> 0:4:41,85
FELICIA: Oh nice.


147
0:4:41,85 --> 0:4:43,31
Kiala, what are you drinking?


148
0:4:43,31 --> 0:4:44,6
KIALA: Tiny champagne.


149
0:4:44,6 --> 0:4:46,2
A Chandon--


150
0:4:46,2 --> 0:4:48,17
VERONICA: Do you have
any orange juice?


151
0:4:48,17 --> 0:4:49,25
KIALA: No.


152
0:4:49,25 --> 0:4:51,5
It's a mimosa without, just
hold the orange juice.


153
0:4:51,5 --> 0:4:52,67
BONNIE: It's just Mo.


154
0:4:52,67 --> 0:4:53,55
Mi.


155
0:4:53,55 --> 0:4:53,71
VERONICA: It's a mo.


156
0:4:53,71 --> 0:4:54,82
BONNIE: Sa.


157
0:4:54,82 --> 0:4:58,36
KIALA: But it's a
twist off cap.


158
0:4:58,36 --> 0:4:59,53
I am the trashiest.


159
0:4:59,53 --> 0:5:0,34
BONNIE: You know what?


160
0:5:0,34 --> 0:5:1,395
VERONICA: I don't like
twist off caps.


161
0:5:1,395 --> 0:5:3,74
KIALA: I like them but
I feel not classy.


162
0:5:3,74 --> 0:5:6,465
BONNIE: You should try the
Sophia Coppola champagne.


163
0:5:6,465 --> 0:5:9,66
I think it's pink and that
has a twist off cap.


164
0:5:9,66 --> 0:5:10,38
FELICIA: Ooh.


165
0:5:10,38 --> 0:5:11,92
I like her movies.


166
0:5:11,92 --> 0:5:14,14
BONNIE: Also if you want to make
Bellinis there's a really


167
0:5:14,14 --> 0:5:16,33
good peach champagne.


168
0:5:16,33 --> 0:5:17,95
FELICIA: You had grumpy
cat face on Kiala.


169
0:5:17,95 --> 0:5:19,2
KIALA: Yeah--


170
0:5:19,2 --> 0:5:21,49



171
0:5:21,49 --> 0:5:21,89
BONNIE: OK.


172
0:5:21,89 --> 0:5:22,665
Well--


173
0:5:22,665 --> 0:5:24,23
FELICIA: Oh wait,
sorry Bonnie.


174
0:5:24,23 --> 0:5:25,8
KIALA: Oh I'm sorry Bonnie.


175
0:5:25,8 --> 0:5:26,405
FELICIA: You were finishing
your pink champagne.


176
0:5:26,405 --> 0:5:27,16
Pink champagne.


177
0:5:27,16 --> 0:5:31,12
BONNIE: Oh yeah, I was just
saying that I drink way over


178
0:5:31,12 --> 0:5:33,61
the top lame ass champagne.


179
0:5:33,61 --> 0:5:37,62
So I always drink peach flavored
champagne, and I mix


180
0:5:37,62 --> 0:5:40,15
it with peach juice,
and make Bellinis.


181
0:5:40,15 --> 0:5:43,851
Oh you guys are all making
a horrible face.


182
0:5:43,851 --> 0:5:45,35
VERONICA: We were making
the grumpy cat face.


183
0:5:45,35 --> 0:5:48,23
FELICIA: We're doing
grumpy cat face.


184
0:5:48,23 --> 0:5:49,5
BONNIE: Am I being
too white trash?


185
0:5:49,5 --> 0:5:55,62
I mean, I only drink Cristal
in a diamond goblet.


186
0:5:55,62 --> 0:5:57,37
VERONICA: You've got to get
sturgeon face in there too.


187
0:5:57,37 --> 0:5:59,826
It's all about the
sturgeon face.


188
0:5:59,826 --> 0:6:1,56
BONNIE: No, do grumpy cat.


189
0:6:1,56 --> 0:6:2,85
Do grumpy cat, Veronica.


190
0:6:2,85 --> 0:6:4,405
Grumpy cat.


191
0:6:4,405 --> 0:6:6,67
VERONICA: There we go.


192
0:6:6,67 --> 0:6:7,41
FELICIA: I think we lost--


193
0:6:7,41 --> 0:6:10,85
I went to Jamaica for
the holidays.


194
0:6:10,85 --> 0:6:12,57
And I didn't do--


195
0:6:12,57 --> 0:6:14,57
well I actually didn't
do much.


196
0:6:14,57 --> 0:6:17,7
But at the airport they had a
couple things that I got.


197
0:6:17,7 --> 0:6:20,37
So I'm drinking this overproof
rum, which I


198
0:6:20,37 --> 0:6:21,575
didn't know they made.


199
0:6:21,575 --> 0:6:21,99
I don't understand.


200
0:6:21,99 --> 0:6:23,61
Is that more alcohol then?


201
0:6:23,61 --> 0:6:24,735
VERONICA: Yeah, I guess.


202
0:6:24,735 --> 0:6:27,29
Is that like overclocking
your PC except with rum?


203
0:6:27,29 --> 0:6:29,245
FELICIA: It's 63%
volume alcohol.


204
0:6:29,245 --> 0:6:30,91
Is that a lot?


205
0:6:30,91 --> 0:6:31,57
BONNIE: Let's find out.


206
0:6:31,57 --> 0:6:32,28
VERONICA: 60%?


207
0:6:32,28 --> 0:6:33,825
60% is pretty high.


208
0:6:33,825 --> 0:6:34,1
FELICIA: 63.


209
0:6:34,1 --> 0:6:35,88
VERONICA: 63% is pretty high.


210
0:6:35,88 --> 0:6:41,1
FELICIA: And then I got this
Magnum Tonic Wine with iron


211
0:6:41,1 --> 0:6:43,63
and vitamins made
with vigorton.


212
0:6:43,63 --> 0:6:43,99
VERONICA: What?


213
0:6:43,99 --> 0:6:45,5
I want that.


214
0:6:45,5 --> 0:6:47,67
FELICIA: No but look, I just
thought it was appropriate for


215
0:6:47,67 --> 0:6:48,22
Vaginal Fantasy.


216
0:6:48,22 --> 0:6:49,39
BONNIE: Is that Magnum
P.I. on it?


217
0:6:49,39 --> 0:6:50,4
FELICIA: Look at the label.


218
0:6:50,4 --> 0:6:52,26
There's a guy and a
girl making out.


219
0:6:52,26 --> 0:6:53,66
There's her booty.


220
0:6:53,66 --> 0:6:54,155
There's a guy.


221
0:6:54,155 --> 0:6:55,22
KIALA: That is a monkey.


222
0:6:55,22 --> 0:6:55,55
BONNIE: That's a monkey.


223
0:6:55,55 --> 0:6:56,17
KIALA: That is a monkey.


224
0:6:56,17 --> 0:6:57,376
FELICIA: No, it's a lady.


225
0:6:57,376 --> 0:7:0,3
BONNIE: It's a monkey holding
a coconut on a skateboard.


226
0:7:0,3 --> 0:7:3,5
FELICIA: No, it's a chick with
some boobs, coconut boobs.


227
0:7:3,5 --> 0:7:5,0
BONNIE: This is the worst
workshop test ever.


228
0:7:5,0 --> 0:7:6,46
VERONICA: I've got
a lovely bunch of


229
0:7:6,46 --> 0:7:8,5
coconuts, do do do do.


230
0:7:8,5 --> 0:7:8,84
FELICIA: No, no.


231
0:7:8,84 --> 0:7:9,12
It doesn't look good.


232
0:7:9,12 --> 0:7:10,71
It's gotten vigorton on it.


233
0:7:10,71 --> 0:7:11,84
VERONICA: That's what my mom
got me for Christmas.


234
0:7:11,84 --> 0:7:12,65
KIALA: It sounds Australian.


235
0:7:12,65 --> 0:7:13,356
BONNIE: Wait, what?


236
0:7:13,356 --> 0:7:13,71
What's that?


237
0:7:13,71 --> 0:7:15,98
VERONICA: My mom got me
this for Christmas.


238
0:7:15,98 --> 0:7:17,6
BONNIE: Is that two
guys making out?


239
0:7:17,6 --> 0:7:18,55
FELICIA: Oh no.


240
0:7:18,55 --> 0:7:19,41
What is that?


241
0:7:19,41 --> 0:7:21,2
KIALA: Modernism
and the Women's


242
0:7:21,2 --> 0:7:22,92
Popular Romance in Britain.


243
0:7:22,92 --> 0:7:24,37
I read that for everyone.


244
0:7:24,37 --> 0:7:24,96
Because I read.


245
0:7:24,96 --> 0:7:25,18
VERONICA: Thank you.


246
0:7:25,18 --> 0:7:26,65
BONNIE: Thanks for reading
aloud, thank you.


247
0:7:26,65 --> 0:7:27,97
VERONICA: And I think that looks
like Matthew McConaughey


248
0:7:27,97 --> 0:7:28,85
on the cover.


249
0:7:28,85 --> 0:7:30,22
KIALA: It does.


250
0:7:30,22 --> 0:7:32,25
And Myrna Loy.


251
0:7:32,25 --> 0:7:34,96
Myrna Loy and Matthew
McConaughey.


252
0:7:34,96 --> 0:7:36,81
BONNIE: We're in the
French [INAUDIBLE].


253
0:7:36,81 --> 0:7:37,565
The French [INAUDIBLE].


254
0:7:37,565 --> 0:7:38,645
VERONICA: By Martin Hipsky.


255
0:7:38,645 --> 0:7:39,79
I'm going to read it.


256
0:7:39,79 --> 0:7:42,15
It's going to be pretty cool.


257
0:7:42,15 --> 0:7:42,86
FELICIA: That's really cool.


258
0:7:42,86 --> 0:7:43,26
OK.


259
0:7:43,26 --> 0:7:47,112
So I guess we should get
on with the show.


260
0:7:47,112 --> 0:7:48,82
BONNIE: Which one are we
talking about first?


261
0:7:48,82 --> 0:7:50,37
FELICIA: Well, I want
to give a shout out


262
0:7:50,37 --> 0:7:51,69
to the local meetup.


263
0:7:51,69 --> 0:7:53,3
The local meetups.


264
0:7:53,3 --> 0:7:55,7
We had a bunch of meetups
this month.


265
0:7:55,7 --> 0:7:57,0
And there's some people who
are getting together in


266
0:7:57,0 --> 0:8:0,26
various places in January to
talk about this month's book.


267
0:8:0,26 --> 0:8:3,16
In New York City a group
met at Argo Tea.


268
0:8:3,16 --> 0:8:6,23
In Orange County a bunch of
people met at the Disney's


269
0:8:6,23 --> 0:8:8,75
Grand Californian hotel.


270
0:8:8,75 --> 0:8:11,29
In Portland people
met at Lucky Lab.


271
0:8:11,29 --> 0:8:14,26
Washington D.C. had a meet up
at the Portrait museum.


272
0:8:14,26 --> 0:8:17,75
And upcoming ones, North
Hollywood is meeting on the


273
0:8:17,75 --> 0:8:21,14
sixth to discuss the books we're
talking about now at the


274
0:8:21,14 --> 0:8:22,56
SteamPunk Cafe.


275
0:8:22,56 --> 0:8:24,88
The Twin Cities is
having a meetup.


276
0:8:24,88 --> 0:8:26,35
Atlanta is putting together
a meetup.


277
0:8:26,35 --> 0:8:27,81
And there's one in Chicago.


278
0:8:27,81 --> 0:8:31,94
So if you want to make your own
meetup you just go to the


279
0:8:31,94 --> 0:8:35,549
Goodreads Group and there is a
thread for local meetups and


280
0:8:35,549 --> 0:8:36,74
they're actually really fun.


281
0:8:36,74 --> 0:8:39,36
So there tend to be a bunch
every month that everybody


282
0:8:39,36 --> 0:8:40,78
gets together to do.


283
0:8:40,78 --> 0:8:41,539
So yes.


284
0:8:41,539 --> 0:8:44,69
The book this month is called
Succubus Blues.


285
0:8:44,69 --> 0:8:47,74
And I will give you a
short description.


286
0:8:47,74 --> 0:8:50,2
"When it comes to jobs in hell,
being a succubus seems


287
0:8:50,2 --> 0:8:50,99
pretty glamorous.


288
0:8:50,99 --> 0:8:52,47
A girl can be anything
she wants.


289
0:8:52,47 --> 0:8:54,3
The wardrobe is killer, and
the mortal men will do


290
0:8:54,3 --> 0:8:55,9
anything just for a touch.


291
0:8:55,9 --> 0:8:59,31
But Seattle succubus
Georgina Kincaid's


292
0:8:59,31 --> 0:9:1,1
life is far from exotic.


293
0:9:1,1 --> 0:9:4,99
She works at a local bookstore
and she has easy access to the


294
0:9:4,99 --> 0:9:9,34
sexy writer Seth Mortensen but
there's something wicked going


295
0:9:9,34 --> 0:9:13,78
on in Seattle's demon
underground." So that is by


296
0:9:13,78 --> 0:9:14,29
Richelle Mead.


297
0:9:14,29 --> 0:9:15,6
That was the book we all
read this month.


298
0:9:15,6 --> 0:9:18,12
And what did we think
about it?


299
0:9:18,12 --> 0:9:20,77
BONNIE: I liked it.


300
0:9:20,77 --> 0:9:22,2
FELICIA: And why?


301
0:9:22,2 --> 0:9:23,89



302
0:9:23,89 --> 0:9:26,0
BONNIE: The end.


303
0:9:26,0 --> 0:9:28,34
FELICIA: Thank you for joining
Vaginal Fantasy with me.


304
0:9:28,34 --> 0:9:29,63
VERONICA: I liked it.


305
0:9:29,63 --> 0:9:32,8
BONNIE: I told you that I read
all the comments and they said


306
0:9:32,8 --> 0:9:33,53
I needed to not talk so much.


307
0:9:33,53 --> 0:9:34,443
So that's it.


308
0:9:34,443 --> 0:9:36,19
FELICIA: Never read the
comments Bonnie.


309
0:9:36,19 --> 0:9:37,7
BONNIE: I know, but I have to.


310
0:9:37,7 --> 0:9:39,44
VERONICA: There's a Twitter
account called "Don't Read


311
0:9:39,44 --> 0:9:41,4
Comments," and all
it is a daily


312
0:9:41,4 --> 0:9:43,65
reminder to not read comments.


313
0:9:43,65 --> 0:9:47,13
BONNIE: As one of the hosts it's
our obligation to answer


314
0:9:47,13 --> 0:9:48,96
questions in the comments too.


315
0:9:48,96 --> 0:9:49,35
VERONICA: Yeah.


316
0:9:49,35 --> 0:9:50,58
I get it.


317
0:9:50,58 --> 0:9:53,61
BONNIE: I liked it because
weirdly enough I super


318
0:9:53,61 --> 0:9:57,3
identified with the main
character because I drink


319
0:9:57,3 --> 0:10:0,4
three mochas a day and
I talk to my pet.


320
0:10:0,4 --> 0:10:3,11
And I crush on authors.


321
0:10:3,11 --> 0:10:6,32
And I've had author encounters
where I was a total idiot


322
0:10:6,32 --> 0:10:9,58
because I didn't know
who they were.


323
0:10:9,58 --> 0:10:11,3
And, yeah.


324
0:10:11,3 --> 0:10:12,1
There's just a lot of things.


325
0:10:12,1 --> 0:10:15,34
Other than the fact that I
can't shapeshift into hot


326
0:10:15,34 --> 0:10:21,0
chicks with horns yet, I really
identified with her.


327
0:10:21,0 --> 0:10:21,75
I liked her.


328
0:10:21,75 --> 0:10:23,82
And I liked the writing
style in this book.


329
0:10:23,82 --> 0:10:26,35
It was really easy
to get into.


330
0:10:26,35 --> 0:10:30,91
There wasn't a lot of hardcore
sexy times enough.


331
0:10:30,91 --> 0:10:33,99
But I just liked the writing
style and I liked all the


332
0:10:33,99 --> 0:10:34,59
characters.


333
0:10:34,59 --> 0:10:38,11
And I could picture it as a TV
show or a movie really, really


334
0:10:38,11 --> 0:10:39,36
fast and easily.


335
0:10:39,36 --> 0:10:42,26



336
0:10:42,26 --> 0:10:44,14
I read the book quickly
because I didn't


337
0:10:44,14 --> 0:10:45,42
want to put it down.


338
0:10:45,42 --> 0:10:48,44
Which is funny because the main
character, Georgina in


339
0:10:48,44 --> 0:10:51,67
the book, she talks about how
she reads books slowly because


340
0:10:51,67 --> 0:10:54,97
she really wants that first time
she reads a good book to


341
0:10:54,97 --> 0:10:58,42
last a long time, which
I've done that too.


342
0:10:58,42 --> 0:10:59,58
I didn't do that
with this book.


343
0:10:59,58 --> 0:11:0,28
I just read it really quick.


344
0:11:0,28 --> 0:11:1,37
It was really good.


345
0:11:1,37 --> 0:11:3,36
I liked it.


346
0:11:3,36 --> 0:11:5,36
FELICIA: It's funny that you
say that about a TV show


347
0:11:5,36 --> 0:11:7,64
because there is a Canadian
show called Lost


348
0:11:7,64 --> 0:11:9,79
Girl about a succubus.


349
0:11:9,79 --> 0:11:11,91
And I think it's on Syfy
channel right now.


350
0:11:11,91 --> 0:11:14,11
I've always wanted
to marathon it.


351
0:11:14,11 --> 0:11:14,82
BONNIE: It's good.


352
0:11:14,82 --> 0:11:18,3
FELICIA: But a lot of people,
especially on Twitter, are


353
0:11:18,3 --> 0:11:19,21
really big fans of it.


354
0:11:19,21 --> 0:11:20,44
So I'm going to definitely
check it out.


355
0:11:20,44 --> 0:11:22,55
And then someone said this book
was optioned to be a TV


356
0:11:22,55 --> 0:11:23,4
show last year.


357
0:11:23,4 --> 0:11:25,47
So you never know.


358
0:11:25,47 --> 0:11:29,15
VERONICA: That almost never
means anything unfortunately.


359
0:11:29,15 --> 0:11:31,42
FELICIA: Kiala, what did
you think of the book?


360
0:11:31,42 --> 0:11:32,66
KIALA: I really liked it.


361
0:11:32,66 --> 0:11:37,55
I thought that there was some
kind of cliche, sloppy writing


362
0:11:37,55 --> 0:11:40,81
bits, but overall I
really liked it.


363
0:11:40,81 --> 0:11:46,21
And I liked her crushing on an
author, because I've gone


364
0:11:46,21 --> 0:11:47,44
through that exact same thing.


365
0:11:47,44 --> 0:11:52,66
In fact, one time Dan Kennedy,
he's one of my favorite


366
0:11:52,66 --> 0:11:54,3
writers from McSweeney's.


367
0:11:54,3 --> 0:11:55,6
Yeah, from Moth.


368
0:11:55,6 --> 0:11:58,77
And he was coming here to read
at Powell's and I have friends


369
0:11:58,77 --> 0:12:0,43
who work there and they
know him very well.


370
0:12:0,43 --> 0:12:2,78
And I thought that I was going
to get a chance to meet him,


371
0:12:2,78 --> 0:12:3,88
we were going to go
out afterwards.


372
0:12:3,88 --> 0:12:5,72
But I wasn't sure that
was going to happen.


373
0:12:5,72 --> 0:12:6,69
It was all kind of new.


374
0:12:6,69 --> 0:12:9,9
And I had written a blog post on
my personal blog about how


375
0:12:9,9 --> 0:12:11,5
I wanted him to look at me and
tell me we were going to run


376
0:12:11,5 --> 0:12:13,455
away together and he was going
to take away from all this


377
0:12:13,455 --> 0:12:15,7
filth and poverty.


378
0:12:15,7 --> 0:12:18,61
And so we we all did end up
going out after his reading.


379
0:12:18,61 --> 0:12:21,51
And then they told him about my
blog post and he pulled out


380
0:12:21,51 --> 0:12:24,31
his iPhone and he read
it aloud to me.


381
0:12:24,31 --> 0:12:26,854
VERONICA: Oh my God, that
was embarrassing.


382
0:12:26,854 --> 0:12:28,275
That's like a Moth episode.


383
0:12:28,275 --> 0:12:30,654
That's basically
a Moth episode.


384
0:12:30,654 --> 0:12:31,56
BONNIE: Nice.


385
0:12:31,56 --> 0:12:34,0
KIALA: And then at the end of
the night he shook my hand and


386
0:12:34,0 --> 0:12:35,95
he looked down at me and he
said, "I'm going to take you


387
0:12:35,95 --> 0:12:38,64
away from all this filth
and poverty." And it


388
0:12:38,64 --> 0:12:40,7
was the best thing.


389
0:12:40,7 --> 0:12:40,69
VERONICA: But then he didn't.


390
0:12:40,69 --> 0:12:42,36
BONNIE: Obviously he didn't.


391
0:12:42,36 --> 0:12:42,81
VERONICA: He didn't.


392
0:12:42,81 --> 0:12:44,62
FELICIA: He's a liar.


393
0:12:44,62 --> 0:12:45,696
KIALA: He's a liar.


394
0:12:45,696 --> 0:12:46,53
VERONICA: He's a liar.


395
0:12:46,53 --> 0:12:49,77
KIALA: Anyway, so that, I really
identified with that.


396
0:12:49,77 --> 0:12:53,235
And I actually enjoyed
the story a lot.


397
0:12:53,235 --> 0:12:56,47
And I was surprised
at the end.


398
0:12:56,47 --> 0:12:58,72
I thought I knew what was going
to happen and I didn't


399
0:12:58,72 --> 0:13:0,41
know what was going to happen.


400
0:13:0,41 --> 0:13:1,14
FELICIA: That's interesting.


401
0:13:1,14 --> 0:13:3,13
OK, Veronica, you look
a little skeptical.


402
0:13:3,13 --> 0:13:4,23
What do you think?


403
0:13:4,23 --> 0:13:5,46
VERONICA: No, I loved it.


404
0:13:5,46 --> 0:13:6,17
I thought it was fun.


405
0:13:6,17 --> 0:13:7,36
I thought it was a really
great book.


406
0:13:7,36 --> 0:13:8,75
I had a great time reading it.


407
0:13:8,75 --> 0:13:11,84
Georgina as a character I think
was probably one of the


408
0:13:11,84 --> 0:13:13,86
more relatable characters
we've read in


409
0:13:13,86 --> 0:13:14,85
a really long time.


410
0:13:14,85 --> 0:13:18,71
I could picture everything
in her life so exactly.


411
0:13:18,71 --> 0:13:21,32
It's one of the first books
where I was almost picturing


412
0:13:21,32 --> 0:13:23,78
myself as her, except obviously
not as hot because


413
0:13:23,78 --> 0:13:24,83
she's super hot.


414
0:13:24,83 --> 0:13:25,68
But at the bookstore--


415
0:13:25,68 --> 0:13:26,41
FELICIA: You're super hot.


416
0:13:26,41 --> 0:13:27,63
BONNIE: You're super hot.


417
0:13:27,63 --> 0:13:28,42
Come on.


418
0:13:28,42 --> 0:13:30,23
VERONICA: But at the bookstore
I was picturing my hometown


419
0:13:30,23 --> 0:13:33,21
Barnes and Noble and there was
this little metaphysical store


420
0:13:33,21 --> 0:13:35,75
that I used to go to when I
was a teenager in my town.


421
0:13:35,75 --> 0:13:37,42
I was picturing that as
the place she went to


422
0:13:37,42 --> 0:13:39,14
go talk with Eric.


423
0:13:39,14 --> 0:13:40,8
Or whatever his name was.


424
0:13:40,8 --> 0:13:44,6
And just the clubs I used to go
to in Boston is where she


425
0:13:44,6 --> 0:13:47,39
got trashed that night that they
were playing the show and


426
0:13:47,39 --> 0:13:49,37
she went and made out with
him near the bathroom.


427
0:13:49,37 --> 0:13:51,88
So all of that stuff for some
reason, it was like maybe it


428
0:13:51,88 --> 0:13:54,61
was because it was modern
times and she was really


429
0:13:54,61 --> 0:13:59,2
living more in the regular world
than any other kind of


430
0:13:59,2 --> 0:14:1,3
fantastical kind of world.


431
0:14:1,3 --> 0:14:2,56
It was just really easy
to relate to her.


432
0:14:2,56 --> 0:14:7,45
And I knew one of the two love
interests was going to be the


433
0:14:7,45 --> 0:14:8,93
trouble at the end.


434
0:14:8,93 --> 0:14:10,1
I knew it was one of them.


435
0:14:10,1 --> 0:14:12,73
I just couldn't really figure
out who it was until right up


436
0:14:12,73 --> 0:14:13,81
when it happened.


437
0:14:13,81 --> 0:14:17,5
And then I thought that the
sister being the other, the


438
0:14:17,5 --> 0:14:19,25
sister being the bitch
from the other


439
0:14:19,25 --> 0:14:22,47
bookstore, that was fun.


440
0:14:22,47 --> 0:14:24,25
That was a fun little twist.


441
0:14:24,25 --> 0:14:26,72
So it all came together
really, really


442
0:14:26,72 --> 0:14:28,58
nicely in the end.


443
0:14:28,58 --> 0:14:30,34
And I liked her very much
as a character.


444
0:14:30,34 --> 0:14:32,3
So I thought this was
a series I would


445
0:14:32,3 --> 0:14:33,28
like to continue reading.


446
0:14:33,28 --> 0:14:34,95
FELICIA: Yeah, I definitely want
to pick up the next one.


447
0:14:34,95 --> 0:14:36,61
By the way, your
not being sexy.


448
0:14:36,61 --> 0:14:38,6
Somebody just sent a comment,
said they want to


449
0:14:38,6 --> 0:14:39,45
put a baby in you.


450
0:14:39,45 --> 0:14:40,14
So come on.


451
0:14:40,14 --> 0:14:43,23
KIALA: Baby [INAUDIBLE].


452
0:14:43,23 --> 0:14:44,64
VERONICA: I've got a puppy,
that's enough to deal with.


453
0:14:44,64 --> 0:14:46,87
No babies.


454
0:14:46,87 --> 0:14:49,49
One thing keeping me up at night
is all I need right now.


455
0:14:49,49 --> 0:14:51,47
FELICIA: Oh my gosh.


456
0:14:51,47 --> 0:14:53,37
I agree with everybody here.


457
0:14:53,37 --> 0:14:57,18
I actually was a fan of this
author from her other series


458
0:14:57,18 --> 0:14:59,26
which I can't remember
the name of it.


459
0:14:59,26 --> 0:15:4,6
It's about a shaman or,
I don't want to


460
0:15:4,6 --> 0:15:5,29
talk about that series.


461
0:15:5,29 --> 0:15:7,1
But it was a very enjoyable
series too.


462
0:15:7,1 --> 0:15:8,76
So I'd never read this one.


463
0:15:8,76 --> 0:15:11,35
And I think this was one
of her first books.


464
0:15:11,35 --> 0:15:13,15
She also has a very popular
series called


465
0:15:13,15 --> 0:15:15,606
Vampire Academy, I think.


466
0:15:15,606 --> 0:15:16,62
VERONICA: I've hear
of that, yeah.


467
0:15:16,62 --> 0:15:19,62
FELICIA: Yeah it's a teen
series, which I don't really


468
0:15:19,62 --> 0:15:20,87
read a lot of teen series.


469
0:15:20,87 --> 0:15:21,91
VERONICA: That's out on
Penguin, isn't it?


470
0:15:21,91 --> 0:15:22,99
That's Penguin.


471
0:15:22,99 --> 0:15:24,17
FELICIA: Yeah I think so.


472
0:15:24,17 --> 0:15:25,8
BONNIE: How is that
not a TV show?


473
0:15:25,8 --> 0:15:27,15
That sounds like that
should be a TV show.


474
0:15:27,15 --> 0:15:29,35
FELICIA: I think everything gets
optioned and then it just


475
0:15:29,35 --> 0:15:29,99
never gets made.


476
0:15:29,99 --> 0:15:32,1
That's just TV for you.


477
0:15:32,1 --> 0:15:34,31
But I really liked
the characters.


478
0:15:34,31 --> 0:15:34,98
I agree.


479
0:15:34,98 --> 0:15:37,38
I definitely wanted
to live her life.


480
0:15:37,38 --> 0:15:39,51
It was very relatable
and grounded.


481
0:15:39,51 --> 0:15:42,23
The only thing I kept wondering
was like, she wasn't


482
0:15:42,23 --> 0:15:43,89
a succubus very often.


483
0:15:43,89 --> 0:15:46,66
So there was never a lot of
conflict with her succubus


484
0:15:46,66 --> 0:15:48,67
needs or job.


485
0:15:48,67 --> 0:15:52,7
There was not a lot of pressure
on her to fulfill the


486
0:15:52,7 --> 0:15:53,38
succubus need.


487
0:15:53,38 --> 0:15:55,99
And she's been a succubus for
1,000 years or hundreds of


488
0:15:55,99 --> 0:15:58,48
years or whatever, it felt like
she would have had more


489
0:15:58,48 --> 0:15:59,78
of a job there.


490
0:15:59,78 --> 0:16:3,3
But if you suspend your
disbelief there I loved all


491
0:16:3,3 --> 0:16:4,79
the characters around her.


492
0:16:4,79 --> 0:16:7,41
I've fanned on so
many authors.


493
0:16:7,41 --> 0:16:8,16
That's my trigger point.


494
0:16:8,16 --> 0:16:9,99
I don't care about actors.


495
0:16:9,99 --> 0:16:13,92
But I actually sent a tweet to
Graham Linehan who does IT


496
0:16:13,92 --> 0:16:16,876
Crowd because I've been
obsessed with him.


497
0:16:16,876 --> 0:16:19,63
BONNIE: And he also does Black
Books and Father Ted.


498
0:16:19,63 --> 0:16:21,98
FELICIA: Oh I know, I
watched all of them.


499
0:16:21,98 --> 0:16:23,2
KIALA: I love Black Books.


500
0:16:23,2 --> 0:16:24,98
FELICIA: Yeah, Black
Books is amazing.


501
0:16:24,98 --> 0:16:26,15
And I have Father Ted.


502
0:16:26,15 --> 0:16:27,7
It just got here.


503
0:16:27,7 --> 0:16:29,7
Every single episode.


504
0:16:29,7 --> 0:16:31,77
So I tweeted to him and he
actually responded to me, and


505
0:16:31,77 --> 0:16:33,435
I literally started sweating
everywhere.


506
0:16:33,435 --> 0:16:36,74



507
0:16:36,74 --> 0:16:38,34
BONNIE: He's pretty awesome.


508
0:16:38,34 --> 0:16:40,28
He's Glinner on Twitter
in case any of you


509
0:16:40,28 --> 0:16:41,38
want to follow him.


510
0:16:41,38 --> 0:16:43,59
FELICIA: And it's really funny
too because now I follow him


511
0:16:43,59 --> 0:16:44,31
in a creepy way.


512
0:16:44,31 --> 0:16:46,21
BONNIE: He followed me for a
little while until he realized


513
0:16:46,21 --> 0:16:48,71
how much I tweeted him and he
wised up and unfollowed me


514
0:16:48,71 --> 0:16:50,8
which is totally fine.


515
0:16:50,8 --> 0:16:52,85
KIALA: That happened to me
with William Gibson.


516
0:16:52,85 --> 0:16:54,65
BONNIE: Yeah, me too.


517
0:16:54,65 --> 0:16:55,66
FELICIA: What, he followed
and unfollowed you?


518
0:16:55,66 --> 0:16:58,76
KIALA: Yeah he followed
me for two years.


519
0:16:58,76 --> 0:17:0,0
And I was afraid to look.


520
0:17:0,0 --> 0:17:2,12
And then finally I looked one
day and he was not following


521
0:17:2,12 --> 0:17:2,8
me anymore.


522
0:17:2,8 --> 0:17:4,22
And I'm like, oh my God, no.


523
0:17:4,22 --> 0:17:4,94
VERONICA: That's the
worst thing.


524
0:17:4,94 --> 0:17:6,75
Do you guys have people
who you do that?


525
0:17:6,75 --> 0:17:8,244
You check every so
often to see if


526
0:17:8,244 --> 0:17:8,839
they're still following?


527
0:17:8,839 --> 0:17:10,369
And you're like, oh my God, I
don't want to click because I


528
0:17:10,369 --> 0:17:11,2
don't want to know.


529
0:17:11,2 --> 0:17:11,829
I don't want to click.


530
0:17:11,829 --> 0:17:14,3
I don't want to know.


531
0:17:14,3 --> 0:17:16,47
BONNIE: I do that
all the time.


532
0:17:16,47 --> 0:17:19,46
There's a site called
Who Unfollowed Me.


533
0:17:19,46 --> 0:17:21,12
VERONICA: Why would you
ever look at that?


534
0:17:21,12 --> 0:17:21,93
FELICIA: No, Bonnie.


535
0:17:21,93 --> 0:17:22,9
VERONICA: What is
wrong with you?


536
0:17:22,9 --> 0:17:25,27
KIALA: You're a masochist.


537
0:17:25,27 --> 0:17:27,599
BONNIE: I just look at it
because sometimes I follow


538
0:17:27,599 --> 0:17:29,32
people just as a favor.


539
0:17:29,32 --> 0:17:31,52
And then if they're not
following me anymore I


540
0:17:31,52 --> 0:17:32,7
unfollow them.


541
0:17:32,7 --> 0:17:32,68
I do that.


542
0:17:32,68 --> 0:17:35,14
Or just like magazines or TV
shows that have been canceled


543
0:17:35,14 --> 0:17:36,16
or whatever.


544
0:17:36,16 --> 0:17:39,6
And then I looked at it the
other day and two friends I


545
0:17:39,6 --> 0:17:42,89
really thought I was close
with unfollowed me.


546
0:17:42,89 --> 0:17:43,56
And I'm like, OK.


547
0:17:43,56 --> 0:17:44,73
I'm not going to take
it personal.


548
0:17:44,73 --> 0:17:47,93
And then two celebrities that
I sort of pseudo stalked


549
0:17:47,93 --> 0:17:48,47
unfollowed me.


550
0:17:48,47 --> 0:17:51,82
And then I remember Noel
Fielding from Mighty Boosh


551
0:17:51,82 --> 0:17:54,69
followed me for five minutes
and it was the best five


552
0:17:54,69 --> 0:17:56,315
minutes of my life.


553
0:17:56,315 --> 0:17:59,12
And I think I DM'd him something
really horrible


554
0:17:59,12 --> 0:18:1,58
like, hey, do you want me to
send you a [INAUDIBLE]?


555
0:18:1,58 --> 0:18:5,3
VERONICA: Oh, you shouldn't
DM people ever.


556
0:18:5,3 --> 0:18:7,235
KIALA: I drunk DM'd
Clive Barker.


557
0:18:7,235 --> 0:18:11,316



558
0:18:11,316 --> 0:18:13,57
He still follows me though.


559
0:18:13,57 --> 0:18:14,64
BONNIE: [INAUDIBLE] at us.


560
0:18:14,64 --> 0:18:15,62
[INAUDIBLE]


561
0:18:15,62 --> 0:18:18,24
because remember we said that
I said that I didn't think


562
0:18:18,24 --> 0:18:20,84
there were sexy times in his
books and he got all freaked


563
0:18:20,84 --> 0:18:23,74
out and he tweeted at
us that there was.


564
0:18:23,74 --> 0:18:24,526
VERONICA: Really?


565
0:18:24,526 --> 0:18:26,74
BONNIE: Yeah.


566
0:18:26,74 --> 0:18:30,15
VERONICA: Well I had the best
finding out of someone


567
0:18:30,15 --> 0:18:33,17
following me ever in my life
a couple of weeks ago.


568
0:18:33,17 --> 0:18:35,426
And I'm scared to even say it
out loud because I don't want


569
0:18:35,426 --> 0:18:36,42
him to unfollow me.


570
0:18:36,42 --> 0:18:42,785
Andrew W.K. I nearly
pooped a brick.


571
0:18:42,785 --> 0:18:46,0
Because I love Andrew W.K.
He's one of my favorite


572
0:18:46,0 --> 0:18:48,935
musicians and I used to go to
his shows all the time.


573
0:18:48,935 --> 0:18:51,7
And he's so party positive.


574
0:18:51,7 --> 0:18:52,61
And I tweeted something about--


575
0:18:52,61 --> 0:18:53,24
what did I tweet about?


576
0:18:53,24 --> 0:18:55,98
Oh, it was a long story.


577
0:18:55,98 --> 0:18:58,43
But he tweeted back at me and
I was like, oh my God.


578
0:18:58,43 --> 0:18:58,97
What?


579
0:18:58,97 --> 0:19:0,125
Where?


580
0:19:0,125 --> 0:19:2,76
What's happening right now?


581
0:19:2,76 --> 0:19:4,3
BONNIE: This is why
I love Twitter.


582
0:19:4,3 --> 0:19:8,34
Because I think it was yesterday
I was tweeting with


583
0:19:8,34 --> 0:19:11,17
some people that were all
watching Starship Troopers.


584
0:19:11,17 --> 0:19:12,24
And we're tweeting
at each other.


585
0:19:12,24 --> 0:19:14,3
And it was all girls tweeting
at each other.


586
0:19:14,3 --> 0:19:17,92
And then Casper Van Dien who's
in the movie tweeted at us.


587
0:19:17,92 --> 0:19:21,35
And we all started tweeting each
other Starship Trooper


588
0:19:21,35 --> 0:19:23,59
stuff and totally
fangirl like.


589
0:19:23,59 --> 0:19:24,79
I'm like, what the hell?


590
0:19:24,79 --> 0:19:25,76
This is awesome.


591
0:19:25,76 --> 0:19:26,765
VERONICA: That's amazing.


592
0:19:26,765 --> 0:19:28,895
BONNIE: That's why I love
Twitter, is because I think


593
0:19:28,895 --> 0:19:33,73
it's great that both actors and
authors get a chance to


594
0:19:33,73 --> 0:19:35,31
freak out their fans.


595
0:19:35,31 --> 0:19:37,65
FELICIA: And you can interact
with people and you don't have


596
0:19:37,65 --> 0:19:40,2
all these preconceived notions
of who you are.


597
0:19:40,2 --> 0:19:42,76
BONNIE: Which is funny because
in the book, in the succubus


598
0:19:42,76 --> 0:19:44,22
book that we read, the very--


599
0:19:44,22 --> 0:19:45,32
KIALA: Oh, we read a book?


600
0:19:45,32 --> 0:19:46,706
FELICIA: Oh yeah, that thing?


601
0:19:46,706 --> 0:19:48,15
KIALA: That show we're supposed
to be having?


602
0:19:48,15 --> 0:19:49,45
BONNIE: No, this is
all relevant.


603
0:19:49,45 --> 0:19:50,51
This is all relevant.


604
0:19:50,51 --> 0:19:53,39
Because he doesn't know
what her favorite


605
0:19:53,39 --> 0:19:54,44
author looks like.


606
0:19:54,44 --> 0:19:57,3
Which I find that hard to
believe because when I have a


607
0:19:57,3 --> 0:19:59,69
favorite author I stalk
them like crazy.


608
0:19:59,69 --> 0:20:1,56
KIALA: Use Google Image
immediately.


609
0:20:1,56 --> 0:20:3,24
BONNIE: Yeah I know everything
about them.


610
0:20:3,24 --> 0:20:5,7
I know their eye color and their
cat's name and what they


611
0:20:5,7 --> 0:20:5,8
eat for breakfast.


612
0:20:5,8 --> 0:20:7,13
I am down with this.


613
0:20:7,13 --> 0:20:10,52
And so when she's like, I don't
know who this author is,


614
0:20:10,52 --> 0:20:14,47
as an author sometimes I have
that fantasy of I have this


615
0:20:14,47 --> 0:20:17,2
revolving fantasy in my brain
that Benedict Cumberbatch is


616
0:20:17,2 --> 0:20:18,87
going to meet me at a party
and it's going to be at my


617
0:20:18,87 --> 0:20:21,4
book signing party and he
doesn't know what I look like.


618
0:20:21,4 --> 0:20:23,14
And he's going to be like, I
really love this author.


619
0:20:23,14 --> 0:20:24,18
And I'll be like, oh really?


620
0:20:24,18 --> 0:20:25,9
Tell me more.


621
0:20:25,9 --> 0:20:27,89
FELICIA: Wow, this sounds
like a beginning


622
0:20:27,89 --> 0:20:29,386
to a bad porn, Bonnie.


623
0:20:29,386 --> 0:20:30,62
BONNIE: You know this is sad.


624
0:20:30,62 --> 0:20:33,635
Since I only write non-fiction
kid books I doubt I'd have a


625
0:20:33,635 --> 0:20:35,44
book party where Benedict
would show up.


626
0:20:35,44 --> 0:20:36,23
FELICIA: You don't know.


627
0:20:36,23 --> 0:20:39,8
KIALA: Unless he has a kid.


628
0:20:39,8 --> 0:20:40,98
VERONICA: And then it
might be too late.


629
0:20:40,98 --> 0:20:41,95
BONNIE: It's never too late.


630
0:20:41,95 --> 0:20:42,84
VERONICA: Never too late.


631
0:20:42,84 --> 0:20:43,34
FELICIA: OK.


632
0:20:43,34 --> 0:20:44,59
A lot of people [INAUDIBLE].


633
0:20:44,59 --> 0:20:46,8



634
0:20:46,8 --> 0:20:47,77
BONNIE: OK go ahead, go ahead.


635
0:20:47,77 --> 0:20:50,89
FELICIA: You didn't ruin his
marriage, you just forgot it.


636
0:20:50,89 --> 0:20:52,26
KIALA: Sorry.


637
0:20:52,26 --> 0:20:52,525
FELICIA: Wow.


638
0:20:52,525 --> 0:20:53,175
OK.


639
0:20:53,175 --> 0:20:55,4
People on the forums really
liked the book.


640
0:20:55,4 --> 0:20:58,66
Camille who's one of our oldest
forum members said, the


641
0:20:58,66 --> 0:21:1,16
book has some of the greatest
quotes I've ever found in some


642
0:21:1,16 --> 0:21:2,946
of these books.


643
0:21:2,946 --> 0:21:7,15
And he's the one who posted that
it got bought, the rights


644
0:21:7,15 --> 0:21:8,63
got optioned.


645
0:21:8,63 --> 0:21:13,47
The only negative thing, a lot
of people basically said the


646
0:21:13,47 --> 0:21:19,56
ending, they could tell in
advance that Roman was going


647
0:21:19,56 --> 0:21:20,61
to be the bad guy.


648
0:21:20,61 --> 0:21:22,83
VERONICA: Oh, well aren't
you guys smart.


649
0:21:22,83 --> 0:21:25,65



650
0:21:25,65 --> 0:21:26,59
BONNIE: Didn't you know?


651
0:21:26,59 --> 0:21:28,595
Couldn't you tell from the fact
that he couldn't put a


652
0:21:28,595 --> 0:21:30,31
bookcase together?


653
0:21:30,31 --> 0:21:31,51
VERONICA: What?


654
0:21:31,51 --> 0:21:31,81
FELICIA: What?


655
0:21:31,81 --> 0:21:34,17
BONNIE: Remember in the
beginning in which he comes


656
0:21:34,17 --> 0:21:37,51
over to help her put her
bookcase together, and he lied


657
0:21:37,51 --> 0:21:39,83
about knowing about
how to put--


658
0:21:39,83 --> 0:21:41,4
why am I the only one
that remembers this?


659
0:21:41,4 --> 0:21:43,42
FELICIA: I do remember that
he was pretty sweet.


660
0:21:43,42 --> 0:21:44,52
KIALA: No, I remember
that but--


661
0:21:44,52 --> 0:21:47,84
BONNIE: No, I know, but I just
made a joke that bad guys


662
0:21:47,84 --> 0:21:50,812
can't put Ikea furniture
together.


663
0:21:50,812 --> 0:21:52,555
FELICIA: Oh, is that
a known thing?


664
0:21:52,555 --> 0:21:54,45
BONNIE: No, I just made it up.


665
0:21:54,45 --> 0:21:54,92
I don't know.


666
0:21:54,92 --> 0:21:57,437
I tried to be funny,
this isn't working.


667
0:21:57,437 --> 0:21:58,75
Kiala, what did you think?


668
0:21:58,75 --> 0:22:2,2
VERONICA: Drink more.


669
0:22:2,2 --> 0:22:4,18
KIALA: I was pretty sure that
it was Roman but then I


670
0:22:4,18 --> 0:22:5,44
thought that was too obvious.


671
0:22:5,44 --> 0:22:11,66
And then actually for a while I
thought that maybe Seth was


672
0:22:11,66 --> 0:22:14,6
a shape shifter and I
thought he and Roman


673
0:22:14,6 --> 0:22:15,31
were the same person.


674
0:22:15,31 --> 0:22:17,66



675
0:22:17,66 --> 0:22:20,99
But then they were at the same
place at the same time and


676
0:22:20,99 --> 0:22:22,35
then I realized that
wasn't true.


677
0:22:22,35 --> 0:22:23,65
BONNIE: That would
be cool though.


678
0:22:23,65 --> 0:22:26,56
FELICIA: Melissa had a really
good point on the forum.


679
0:22:26,56 --> 0:22:29,71
She said she really got into
the book in the last half.


680
0:22:29,71 --> 0:22:31,87
Which I agree, it definitely
picks up in the last half


681
0:22:31,87 --> 0:22:35,36
after the whole plot, the
Nephilim plot gets started.


682
0:22:35,36 --> 0:22:39,225
But it was weird, she got into
it after Carter and wanted


683
0:22:39,225 --> 0:22:41,69
Carter to get together with
Georgina, which I wanted too.


684
0:22:41,69 --> 0:22:42,165
KIALA: Me too.


685
0:22:42,165 --> 0:22:43,15
FELICIA: Carter the angel.


686
0:22:43,15 --> 0:22:45,25
KIALA: Yes, he was so
sweet and strong.


687
0:22:45,25 --> 0:22:50,32
And I kept picturing him
as Misha Collins from


688
0:22:50,32 --> 0:22:51,3
Supernatural.


689
0:22:51,3 --> 0:22:53,793
BONNIE: Supernatural,
I did that too.


690
0:22:53,793 --> 0:22:55,82
The minute they described him
I'm like, oh, Misha Collins.


691
0:22:55,82 --> 0:22:57,25
KIALA: I was like,
oh, it's Cass.


692
0:22:57,25 --> 0:22:59,45
FELICIA: Yeah, because
he was like the sexy,


693
0:22:59,45 --> 0:23:1,97
understanding angel guy.


694
0:23:1,97 --> 0:23:4,0
He's kind of like Cass.


695
0:23:4,0 --> 0:23:6,64
KIALA: I pictured him like that
kind of personality wise.


696
0:23:6,64 --> 0:23:10,86
But honestly picturing him, I
pictured him as Eric Northman.


697
0:23:10,86 --> 0:23:11,97
VERONICA: Really?


698
0:23:11,97 --> 0:23:14,54
That seems a little
large for me.


699
0:23:14,54 --> 0:23:15,11
FELICIA: Really?


700
0:23:15,11 --> 0:23:15,86
VERONICA: Maybe a little
bit too big.


701
0:23:15,86 --> 0:23:17,81
KIALA: Because he was
like a big angel,


702
0:23:17,81 --> 0:23:19,76
like tall and angely.


703
0:23:19,76 --> 0:23:21,49
BONNIE: Angely.


704
0:23:21,49 --> 0:23:23,77
VERONICA: See my problem is I
never picture people in books


705
0:23:23,77 --> 0:23:25,87
as people from the real world.


706
0:23:25,87 --> 0:23:28,6
They always form into
their own things.


707
0:23:28,6 --> 0:23:29,66
It's why I have a
really hard time


708
0:23:29,66 --> 0:23:30,61
with the casting questions.


709
0:23:30,61 --> 0:23:33,68
BONNIE: So I started a Pinterest
board called Sexy


710
0:23:33,68 --> 0:23:36,9
Lads, so if any of you follow
me on Pinterest.


711
0:23:36,9 --> 0:23:39,88
And that's where I put
all my casting picks.


712
0:23:39,88 --> 0:23:41,42
FELICIA: I don't know how
I feel about that.


713
0:23:41,42 --> 0:23:42,11
Is that objectification?


714
0:23:42,11 --> 0:23:45,16
Like if a guy did that about
girls would I be offended?


715
0:23:45,16 --> 0:23:47,9
BONNIE: I do it with
girls too though.


716
0:23:47,9 --> 0:23:51,0
When we think about what
actresses should play the


717
0:23:51,0 --> 0:23:54,5
parts in the books we read, I
do this with actresses too.


718
0:23:54,5 --> 0:23:55,6
I just haven't made a
Pinterest board yet.


719
0:23:55,6 --> 0:23:56,78
I will.


720
0:23:56,78 --> 0:23:59,44
FELICIA: I had an equal
opportunity objectification.


721
0:23:59,44 --> 0:24:2,38
BONNIE: It'll probably just be
mostly Eva Green but yeah,


722
0:24:2,38 --> 0:24:3,49
I'll do it.


723
0:24:3,49 --> 0:24:5,25
FELICIA: Eva Green is who I
thought of Georgina for.


724
0:24:5,25 --> 0:24:8,8
BONNIE: Yeah I know, me too.


725
0:24:8,8 --> 0:24:11,52
KIALA: I had a Pinterest porn
board for a short period of


726
0:24:11,52 --> 0:24:13,64
time because I thought
it was funny.


727
0:24:13,64 --> 0:24:14,88
VERONICA: Did they
take it down?


728
0:24:14,88 --> 0:24:15,95
Did they make you
take it down?


729
0:24:15,95 --> 0:24:17,49
KIALA: No, I took it down.


730
0:24:17,49 --> 0:24:17,81
BONNIE: Is it still there?


731
0:24:17,81 --> 0:24:19,49
KIALA: No, I took it down.


732
0:24:19,49 --> 0:24:21,42
I couldn't bring myself
to pin anything.


733
0:24:21,42 --> 0:24:23,95



734
0:24:23,95 --> 0:24:26,88
FELICIA: Is it like an
empty porn board?


735
0:24:26,88 --> 0:24:28,64
BONNIE: That's like my life.


736
0:24:28,64 --> 0:24:30,21
My life is an empty
porn board.


737
0:24:30,21 --> 0:24:32,7
FELICIA: Oh God, Bonnie.


738
0:24:32,7 --> 0:24:35,1
BONNIE: Sorry, apology
to [INAUDIBLE].


739
0:24:35,1 --> 0:24:35,9
I'll drink more.


740
0:24:35,9 --> 0:24:37,49
Let's talk about
the book, yay.


741
0:24:37,49 --> 0:24:39,71
FELICIA: OK let's talk
the characters.


742
0:24:39,71 --> 0:24:40,36
Georgina.


743
0:24:40,36 --> 0:24:43,56
Sam on the forums loved the
main character, although I


744
0:24:43,56 --> 0:24:46,91
expected her to do more
supernatural things.


745
0:24:46,91 --> 0:24:49,425
She didn't seem to have any
female friends which I thought


746
0:24:49,425 --> 0:24:50,48
was interesting.


747
0:24:50,48 --> 0:24:52,96
And then he wants to know, is
that standard for a succubus


748
0:24:52,96 --> 0:24:56,99
or was a function of her
being a succubus?


749
0:24:56,99 --> 0:24:58,325
What did you guys think?


750
0:24:58,325 --> 0:25:0,99
She had a couple of female
coworkers that were


751
0:25:0,99 --> 0:25:1,47
friends with her.


752
0:25:1,47 --> 0:25:2,235
VERONICA: They weren't
friendly.


753
0:25:2,235 --> 0:25:4,95
Yeah they weren't central
characters at all.


754
0:25:4,95 --> 0:25:7,15
BONNIE: She didn't have
a sassy galpal.


755
0:25:7,15 --> 0:25:10,4
VERONICA: Yeah the only other
major female character was


756
0:25:10,4 --> 0:25:11,535
antagonistic towards her.


757
0:25:11,535 --> 0:25:12,755
FELICIA: Yeah, that's
interesting.


758
0:25:12,755 --> 0:25:16,7
Do you think that's
because she was--


759
0:25:16,7 --> 0:25:17,59
KIALA: So overtly sexual?


760
0:25:17,59 --> 0:25:18,79
FELICIA: Yeah because
you'd think it


761
0:25:18,79 --> 0:25:19,68
would be the opposite.


762
0:25:19,68 --> 0:25:21,77
Like she'd have more female
friends because her only


763
0:25:21,77 --> 0:25:26,37
function is to use her
sexuality to feed.


764
0:25:26,37 --> 0:25:27,87
VERONICA: So maybe she just
doesn't drawn women like that.


765
0:25:27,87 --> 0:25:29,593
BONNIE: She could have attracted
more lesbians, I


766
0:25:29,593 --> 0:25:30,843
don't know.


767
0:25:30,843 --> 0:25:33,1



768
0:25:33,1 --> 0:25:36,75
FELICIA: Also there was actually
a big thread on the


769
0:25:36,75 --> 0:25:38,62
forums about evil as good.


770
0:25:38,62 --> 0:25:43,92
Some people, Jude I think,
started that thread about how


771
0:25:43,92 --> 0:25:47,21
they felt uncomfortable with the
sympathet-- thetification?


772
0:25:47,21 --> 0:25:47,7
Is that a word?


773
0:25:47,7 --> 0:25:48,6
It's not.


774
0:25:48,6 --> 0:25:50,27
Let me drink more.


775
0:25:50,27 --> 0:25:53,32
Making evil characters
more sympathetic.


776
0:25:53,32 --> 0:25:57,72
Because basically her function
on earth is to corrupt people.


777
0:25:57,72 --> 0:25:59,62
VERONICA: But that's silly.


778
0:25:59,62 --> 0:26:1,92
Because there's so many amazing
characters from so


779
0:26:1,92 --> 0:26:4,67
many different stories.


780
0:26:4,67 --> 0:26:6,48
They're supposed to be
evil but they're more


781
0:26:6,48 --> 0:26:10,14
complicated than that.


782
0:26:10,14 --> 0:26:12,32
KIALA: Or like Battlestar
Galactica and all the Cylons.


783
0:26:12,32 --> 0:26:13,63
VERONICA: That's just
the whole point.


784
0:26:13,63 --> 0:26:15,2
You have to have a complicated
character.


785
0:26:15,2 --> 0:26:16,7
You have to have a character
with a lot of dimensions.


786
0:26:16,7 --> 0:26:21,98
And just because they have an
evil job to do or what is


787
0:26:21,98 --> 0:26:26,53
assumed to be an evil job, I
guess it is an evil job.


788
0:26:26,53 --> 0:26:28,51
Bringing their souls into hell,
I guess it's that's


789
0:26:28,51 --> 0:26:28,97
[INAUDIBLE].


790
0:26:28,97 --> 0:26:30,82
FELICIA: Actually she didn't
do a lot of it.


791
0:26:30,82 --> 0:26:32,335
But if she actually did more of
it, you probably wouldn't


792
0:26:32,335 --> 0:26:35,15
have liked her as much.


793
0:26:35,15 --> 0:26:36,43
BONNIE: Let's be honest.


794
0:26:36,43 --> 0:26:37,99
It's not like she did it.


795
0:26:37,99 --> 0:26:40,73
She basically played
on people's


796
0:26:40,73 --> 0:26:42,5
cravings and interests.


797
0:26:42,5 --> 0:26:44,91
KIALA: Yeah they wanted it.


798
0:26:44,91 --> 0:26:46,97
BONNIE: It's ultimately your
decision whether or not you


799
0:26:46,97 --> 0:26:49,32
want your soul to go to heaven
or hell in this book.


800
0:26:49,32 --> 0:26:51,596
If you just choose to give it
up to have sex with a hot


801
0:26:51,596 --> 0:26:52,23
chick then that's--


802
0:26:52,23 --> 0:26:53,27
VERONICA: She's an enabler.


803
0:26:53,27 --> 0:26:55,57
She's an enabler and that's
what it comes down to.


804
0:26:55,57 --> 0:26:58,22
KIALA: I didn't like that stupid
characterization at the


805
0:26:58,22 --> 0:27:2,7
beginning of that it was a
geeky dude living in his


806
0:27:2,7 --> 0:27:2,76
parent's basement.


807
0:27:2,76 --> 0:27:5,48
He was a 34 year old virgin
with Cheeto fingers.


808
0:27:5,48 --> 0:27:8,7



809
0:27:8,7 --> 0:27:9,32
BONNIE: Cheeto fingers
are hot.


810
0:27:9,32 --> 0:27:11,88



811
0:27:11,88 --> 0:27:12,49
VERONICA: You can lick it off.


812
0:27:12,49 --> 0:27:15,504
Like aah.


813
0:27:15,504 --> 0:27:16,754
KIALA: It was so annoying.


814
0:27:16,754 --> 0:27:20,3



815
0:27:20,3 --> 0:27:21,61
Things like that
were annoying.


816
0:27:21,61 --> 0:27:23,936
BONNIE: Veronica, you're going
to be an animated gif of


817
0:27:23,936 --> 0:27:25,81
licking your fingers
before you know it.


818
0:27:25,81 --> 0:27:27,4
VERONICA: Oh God.


819
0:27:27,4 --> 0:27:28,18
It's too late It's
already happened.


820
0:27:28,18 --> 0:27:28,9
It already exists.


821
0:27:28,9 --> 0:27:31,225
KIALA: Yeah, it's
on now already.


822
0:27:31,225 --> 0:27:33,22
I didn't like that.


823
0:27:33,22 --> 0:27:39,25
I didn't like a lot of her
textbook psychologically


824
0:27:39,25 --> 0:27:45,7
damaged, in your face sexuality,
like she only could


825
0:27:45,7 --> 0:27:50,6
identify with people that were
sexually attracted to her.


826
0:27:50,6 --> 0:27:54,62
Like every single man, every
single character in that book


827
0:27:54,62 --> 0:27:57,67
was somebody that she only
related to sexually.


828
0:27:57,67 --> 0:28:0,3
Well other than her gay
vampire best friends.


829
0:28:0,3 --> 0:28:1,42
FELICIA: Yeah that's true.


830
0:28:1,42 --> 0:28:5,24
But also I thought it was kind
of convenient and total wish


831
0:28:5,24 --> 0:28:7,54
fulfillment when she could
change her appearance and all


832
0:28:7,54 --> 0:28:9,27
her clothing instantly.


833
0:28:9,27 --> 0:28:10,19
It was so convenient.


834
0:28:10,19 --> 0:28:10,9
KIALA: It's like a fantasy.


835
0:28:10,9 --> 0:28:12,7
Like a lady fantasy.


836
0:28:12,7 --> 0:28:13,375
FELICIA: It was such a
lady fantasy which


837
0:28:13,375 --> 0:28:14,52
I was jealous of.


838
0:28:14,52 --> 0:28:16,55
She never has to spend any
money on clothing.


839
0:28:16,55 --> 0:28:18,73



840
0:28:18,73 --> 0:28:20,65
BONNIE: That reminded me a
little of Tonks in Harry


841
0:28:20,65 --> 0:28:23,155
Potter because she could change
her hair at any point.


842
0:28:23,155 --> 0:28:25,46
And I'm like, I've dyed my
hair a lot of times.


843
0:28:25,46 --> 0:28:27,63
And if I could just change my
hair without it turning into


844
0:28:27,63 --> 0:28:31,693
like, horrible over dried wet
noodle situation I would do


845
0:28:31,693 --> 0:28:32,8
that in a heartbeat.


846
0:28:32,8 --> 0:28:34,27
VERONICA: By the way, your hair
looks great today Bonnie.


847
0:28:34,27 --> 0:28:35,49
KIALA: It does.


848
0:28:35,49 --> 0:28:37,88
BONNIE: If you follow me on
Pinterest, you might notice


849
0:28:37,88 --> 0:28:40,0
that I had might dye it soon.


850
0:28:40,0 --> 0:28:40,64
FELICIA: [GASP]


851
0:28:40,64 --> 0:28:42,59
What color?


852
0:28:42,59 --> 0:28:42,975
BONNIE: Violet.


853
0:28:42,975 --> 0:28:43,36
VERONICA: Red?


854
0:28:43,36 --> 0:28:44,5
BONNIE: Violet.


855
0:28:44,5 --> 0:28:44,815
Violet.


856
0:28:44,815 --> 0:28:46,71
KIALA: Violet, oh.


857
0:28:46,71 --> 0:28:47,33
FELICIA: I like this.


858
0:28:47,33 --> 0:28:48,85
Veronica I don't have
bangs anymore.


859
0:28:48,85 --> 0:28:50,53
BONNIE: I know, what happened
to them bangs?


860
0:28:50,53 --> 0:28:51,93
FELICIA: I'm going to
get them trimmed.


861
0:28:51,93 --> 0:28:52,97
It's just, I don't know.


862
0:28:52,97 --> 0:28:55,3
It was too traumatic last
time, looking too much.


863
0:28:55,3 --> 0:28:56,413
BONNIE: Why?


864
0:28:56,413 --> 0:28:58,61
You know who I thought
you looked like?


865
0:28:58,61 --> 0:29:2,35
You actually look
like Amy Pond.


866
0:29:2,35 --> 0:29:3,18
FELICIA: With the bangs?


867
0:29:3,18 --> 0:29:4,74
BONNIE: Yeah.


868
0:29:4,74 --> 0:29:5,38
FELICIA: I like that.


869
0:29:5,38 --> 0:29:6,77
BONNIE: That's a compliment.


870
0:29:6,77 --> 0:29:8,58
FELICIA: I mean, I'm going
to get them trimmed.


871
0:29:8,58 --> 0:29:11,81
I just feel like I'm
in the presence of


872
0:29:11,81 --> 0:29:13,47
the mistress of bangs.


873
0:29:13,47 --> 0:29:15,99
And to be a pale imitation
of bangs.


874
0:29:15,99 --> 0:29:17,31
Do you cut your own bangs?


875
0:29:17,31 --> 0:29:18,53
VERONICA: I do.


876
0:29:18,53 --> 0:29:19,29
KIALA: Really?


877
0:29:19,29 --> 0:29:19,74
VERONICA: I do.


878
0:29:19,74 --> 0:29:22,58
Well I get my hair cut once
every month and a half, but


879
0:29:22,58 --> 0:29:24,36
then for touch ups
I do my own.


880
0:29:24,36 --> 0:29:25,7
FELICIA: Yeah that's
what I need to do.


881
0:29:25,7 --> 0:29:29,52
I didn't know that I was
in for maintenance.


882
0:29:29,52 --> 0:29:30,51
BONNIE: I cut my bangs.


883
0:29:30,51 --> 0:29:32,26
I have to cut my bangs
straight every


884
0:29:32,26 --> 0:29:33,24
two weeks or so.


885
0:29:33,24 --> 0:29:33,96
VERONICA: Yeah.


886
0:29:33,96 --> 0:29:34,64
It's a pain.


887
0:29:34,64 --> 0:29:36,3
It's a pain in the butt,
but it's worth it.


888
0:29:36,3 --> 0:29:37,12
BONNIE: You get used to it.


889
0:29:37,12 --> 0:29:39,76
KIALA: I was going to say just
on that Lady Fantasy thing,


890
0:29:39,76 --> 0:29:40,82
there's a series of--


891
0:29:40,82 --> 0:29:43,73
I can't remember who writes
them-- but a series of novels


892
0:29:43,73 --> 0:29:49,36
where the woman, she discovers
she's got this magic, and


893
0:29:49,36 --> 0:29:52,79
every time she uses it, it
expends so much energy she has


894
0:29:52,79 --> 0:29:54,2
to eat and eat and eat.


895
0:29:54,2 --> 0:29:56,48
It also made her really
young and beautiful.


896
0:29:56,48 --> 0:29:59,77
And then she has to eat all the
time and she can't gain


897
0:29:59,77 --> 0:30:0,35
any weight.


898
0:30:0,35 --> 0:30:3,46
Whereas before, she would gain
weight all the time.


899
0:30:3,46 --> 0:30:6,16
BONNIE: Does she have to
eat a certain thing?


900
0:30:6,16 --> 0:30:7,53
KIALA: She just has to
eat a lot of food.


901
0:30:7,53 --> 0:30:9,32
Just binge eat.


902
0:30:9,32 --> 0:30:11,22
But she can't keep weight on.


903
0:30:11,22 --> 0:30:14,59
And it's kind of messed up.


904
0:30:14,59 --> 0:30:18,26
But that was just my
feeling about it.


905
0:30:18,26 --> 0:30:21,55
FELICIA: Silvy Marie on the
forums mentioned her sleeping


906
0:30:21,55 --> 0:30:24,88
with Warren and she
was very upset.


907
0:30:24,88 --> 0:30:28,6
She went to somebody she knows
to get a fix but she didn't


908
0:30:28,6 --> 0:30:28,63
really need it.


909
0:30:28,63 --> 0:30:31,49
And she lost respect
for her then.


910
0:30:31,49 --> 0:30:32,78
BONNIE: I didn't like Warren.


911
0:30:32,78 --> 0:30:35,62
FELICIA: I didn't like Warren
either but I though, I didn't


912
0:30:35,62 --> 0:30:37,42
like her then, but then
I liked the fact that


913
0:30:37,42 --> 0:30:38,31
I didn't like her.


914
0:30:38,31 --> 0:30:39,87
In that it made more
three dimensional.


915
0:30:39,87 --> 0:30:40,93
You don't have to be perfect.


916
0:30:40,93 --> 0:30:43,6
A lot of these books that we
read and the ones that I don't


917
0:30:43,6 --> 0:30:47,3
even list on my good reads,
I can't engage with them.


918
0:30:47,3 --> 0:30:50,7
Because the person is so perfect
you just feel like


919
0:30:50,7 --> 0:30:52,365
she's a martyr.


920
0:30:52,365 --> 0:30:54,21
OK, just mess up once please?


921
0:30:54,21 --> 0:30:56,63
Because you read about a person,
it doesn't feel real.


922
0:30:56,63 --> 0:30:59,6
So that's why I kind of liked
her, knowing that she was


923
0:30:59,6 --> 0:31:2,19
making a bad decision but just
indulging herself with Warren.


924
0:31:2,19 --> 0:31:4,81
VERONICA: Do you think it was on
purpose that they chose one


925
0:31:4,81 --> 0:31:6,82
of the most unlikable
characters?


926
0:31:6,82 --> 0:31:9,42
That she made Warren really
unlikable in order for us to


927
0:31:9,42 --> 0:31:12,94
not feel so bad about Georgina
sleeping with him to get some


928
0:31:12,94 --> 0:31:14,23
powers back?


929
0:31:14,23 --> 0:31:15,78
FELICIA: I think so.


930
0:31:15,78 --> 0:31:17,455
Well also you don't want to
muddy the waters because if he


931
0:31:17,455 --> 0:31:20,0
was sympathetic then what's
going on with


932
0:31:20,0 --> 0:31:21,47
Seth and then Roman?


933
0:31:21,47 --> 0:31:23,65
It would just muddy
everything up.


934
0:31:23,65 --> 0:31:26,8
Like I said, I wanted her
to get with Carter.


935
0:31:26,8 --> 0:31:28,4
VERONICA: That wouldn't
give her any power.


936
0:31:28,4 --> 0:31:30,106
Because he's also
supernatural.


937
0:31:30,106 --> 0:31:32,56
FELICIA: Oh, that's true.


938
0:31:32,56 --> 0:31:36,42
VERONICA: What about
her little friend?


939
0:31:36,42 --> 0:31:37,89
The guy that worked at
the store with her?


940
0:31:37,89 --> 0:31:38,16
KIALA: Doug.


941
0:31:38,16 --> 0:31:39,97
VERONICA: Doug, yeah.


942
0:31:39,97 --> 0:31:42,6
Like if she ends up with
Doug, that would


943
0:31:42,6 --> 0:31:43,45
have been like, whoa.


944
0:31:43,45 --> 0:31:45,84
He's a super nice guy and he
really likes you and now


945
0:31:45,84 --> 0:31:46,76
you're using him.


946
0:31:46,76 --> 0:31:50,58
But with Warren it's like they
mutually use each other.


947
0:31:50,58 --> 0:31:52,38
FELICIA: Exactly.


948
0:31:52,38 --> 0:31:53,98
BONNIE: I don't want to get too
personal here, but usually


949
0:31:53,98 --> 0:31:56,58
when you have a you-know-what
buddy--


950
0:31:56,58 --> 0:31:59,43
I can't swear on this channel,
but you know what I mean--


951
0:31:59,43 --> 0:32:3,25
if you have a sexy times buddy,
chances are that sexy


952
0:32:3,25 --> 0:32:6,89
times buddy isn't the most
redeemable of people.


953
0:32:6,89 --> 0:32:10,96
Because they're using you as
much as you're using them.


954
0:32:10,96 --> 0:32:13,7
I don't know, I'm just saying.


955
0:32:13,7 --> 0:32:14,34
FELICIA: I don't
know about it.


956
0:32:14,34 --> 0:32:17,71
BONNIE: Fits the profile
of the douchebag that--


957
0:32:17,71 --> 0:32:21,92
KIALA: I haven't had one, but
it's not a moral reason.


958
0:32:21,92 --> 0:32:23,25
I just have never had one.


959
0:32:23,25 --> 0:32:23,6
BONNIE: Wow.


960
0:32:23,6 --> 0:32:25,34
Am I the only one
who's had one?


961
0:32:25,34 --> 0:32:26,21
Many?


962
0:32:26,21 --> 0:32:28,19
A few?


963
0:32:28,19 --> 0:32:29,38
FELICIA: Anyway.


964
0:32:29,38 --> 0:32:32,89
Talk about Seth who was one of
the main love interests.


965
0:32:32,89 --> 0:32:37,505
A lot of people really liked
Seth because he was classified


966
0:32:37,505 --> 0:32:38,67
as a beta male.


967
0:32:38,67 --> 0:32:42,73
Which we all, in a lot of these
Vaginal Fantasy book


968
0:32:42,73 --> 0:32:45,64
club picks have had very
dominating men


969
0:32:45,64 --> 0:32:46,75
who are very pushy.


970
0:32:46,75 --> 0:32:48,11
And the girl's like,
no, no, no.


971
0:32:48,11 --> 0:32:48,68
OK fine.


972
0:32:48,68 --> 0:32:49,5
I like you.


973
0:32:49,5 --> 0:32:54,3
And that's become the archetype
of the romance hero.


974
0:32:54,3 --> 0:32:55,82
Seth is kind of the
opposite of that.


975
0:32:55,82 --> 0:32:58,22
He's actually very shy and the
main character doesn't know


976
0:32:58,22 --> 0:32:58,78
what to do with him.


977
0:32:58,78 --> 0:33:0,36
And a lot of people loved him.


978
0:33:0,36 --> 0:33:3,4
Stacey, I loved the emails
that he sent to her.


979
0:33:3,4 --> 0:33:7,73
And what did you guys think
about him as the hero?


980
0:33:7,73 --> 0:33:8,49
BONNIE: Isn't that frustrating
though?


981
0:33:8,49 --> 0:33:11,43
Isn't that kind of frustrating
to have a guy that's really


982
0:33:11,43 --> 0:33:14,4
good at writing emails but when
you're face to face can't


983
0:33:14,4 --> 0:33:16,7
hold a decent conversation
with you?


984
0:33:16,7 --> 0:33:17,42
KIALA: Yeah.


985
0:33:17,42 --> 0:33:19,25
I know one guy like that.


986
0:33:19,25 --> 0:33:21,76
And it's really annoying.


987
0:33:21,76 --> 0:33:22,12
BONNIE: It's annoying.


988
0:33:22,12 --> 0:33:22,99
Yeah.


989
0:33:22,99 --> 0:33:26,2
FELICIA: I had a boyfriend in
high school that gave really


990
0:33:26,2 --> 0:33:27,77
good phone.


991
0:33:27,77 --> 0:33:29,706
He had a great voice, but then
when you met him in person it


992
0:33:29,706 --> 0:33:32,1
was like, this is weird.


993
0:33:32,1 --> 0:33:32,475
VERONICA: Not the same.


994
0:33:32,475 --> 0:33:34,4
Not the same.


995
0:33:34,4 --> 0:33:37,95
I've had a lot of IM boyfriends
like that.


996
0:33:37,95 --> 0:33:40,4
They're really good over IM, and
then in person it's just


997
0:33:40,4 --> 0:33:41,8
like, you're weird.


998
0:33:41,8 --> 0:33:42,56
KIALA: Yeah.


999
0:33:42,56 --> 0:33:45,8
Or the opposite where they're
really great in person but


1000
0:33:45,8 --> 0:33:48,95
then they misspell everything
in texts.


1001
0:33:48,95 --> 0:33:51,3
Or too many emoticons.


1002
0:33:51,3 --> 0:33:52,7
And you're like, oh God, no.


1003
0:33:52,7 --> 0:33:54,555
VERONICA: It's like a smiley
face after every sentence.


1004
0:33:54,555 --> 0:33:57,238
KIALA: Yeah lol.


1005
0:33:57,238 --> 0:33:59,65
BONNIE: Have you ever broken
off anything with someone


1006
0:33:59,65 --> 0:34:1,93
because they kept using
the wrong "there?"


1007
0:34:1,93 --> 0:34:3,17
KIALA: I would.


1008
0:34:3,17 --> 0:34:3,95
FELICIA: I would, yeah.


1009
0:34:3,95 --> 0:34:5,95
KIALA: If they didn't correct
themselves, or the wrong


1010
0:34:5,95 --> 0:34:6,17
"your."


1011
0:34:6,17 --> 0:34:6,54
BONNIE: Like over.


1012
0:34:6,54 --> 0:34:9,699
And once or twice is fine,
but all the time.


1013
0:34:9,699 --> 0:34:12,215
And mixing up "your"
with "you're."


1014
0:34:12,215 --> 0:34:15,133
VERONICA: I don't understand
internet speak sometimes.


1015
0:34:15,133 --> 0:34:15,82
BONNIE: Really?


1016
0:34:15,82 --> 0:34:16,929
VERONICA: Like, I get it.


1017
0:34:16,929 --> 0:34:17,6
I get it.


1018
0:34:17,6 --> 0:34:20,139
I just don't understand
why it's so prevalent.


1019
0:34:20,139 --> 0:34:21,23
FELICIA: Because everybody
does it.


1020
0:34:21,23 --> 0:34:22,79
KIALA: [INAUDIBLE].


1021
0:34:22,79 --> 0:34:23,56
VERONICA: No, no.


1022
0:34:23,56 --> 0:34:25,67
Not like lol, meme speak.


1023
0:34:25,67 --> 0:34:26,659
That's different.


1024
0:34:26,659 --> 0:34:30,3
BONNIE: I still don't know
what the hell "YOLO" is.


1025
0:34:30,3 --> 0:34:31,11
VERONICA: You only live once.


1026
0:34:31,11 --> 0:34:32,989
You only live once.


1027
0:34:32,989 --> 0:34:33,82
BONNIE: Really?


1028
0:34:33,82 --> 0:34:38,469
VERONICA: I'm going to go ride
on the top of my car, YOLO.


1029
0:34:38,469 --> 0:34:40,434
I'm going to ghostride
the whip, YOLO.


1030
0:34:40,434 --> 0:34:43,42



1031
0:34:43,42 --> 0:34:45,11
I'm going to go put a badger
in my pants, YOLO.


1032
0:34:45,11 --> 0:34:48,389



1033
0:34:48,389 --> 0:34:48,96
FELICIA: Badger?


1034
0:34:48,96 --> 0:34:50,1
Where did that come from?


1035
0:34:50,1 --> 0:34:51,21
KIALA: I still don't--


1036
0:34:51,21 --> 0:34:51,92
SMH?


1037
0:34:51,92 --> 0:34:54,56
I can never remember what--
it's So Much Hate, right?


1038
0:34:54,56 --> 0:34:55,54
VERONICA: Oh is that
what that means?


1039
0:34:55,54 --> 0:34:56,44
BONNIE: Is that what that is?


1040
0:34:56,44 --> 0:34:57,952
FELICIA: I wouldn't know
that one either.


1041
0:34:57,952 --> 0:34:58,95
KIALA: I don't know.


1042
0:34:58,95 --> 0:35:0,4
I think that's it.


1043
0:35:0,4 --> 0:35:2,12
VERONICA: TLDR is one
of my favorites.


1044
0:35:2,12 --> 0:35:3,53
BONNIE: What's that one?


1045
0:35:3,53 --> 0:35:4,937
VERONICA: Too Long,
Didn't Read.


1046
0:35:4,937 --> 0:35:6,5
FELICIA: That's the most
insulting one.


1047
0:35:6,5 --> 0:35:8,28
Just put some effort in
or don't join the


1048
0:35:8,28 --> 0:35:9,26
conversation, please.


1049
0:35:9,26 --> 0:35:10,99
VERONICA: No, you want to know
what the most insulting


1050
0:35:10,99 --> 0:35:12,79
hashtag of all time is?


1051
0:35:12,79 --> 0:35:13,14
BONNIE: What?


1052
0:35:13,14 --> 0:35:15,866
VERONICA: First World
Problems.


1053
0:35:15,866 --> 0:35:18,63
People respond to me and now
this is going to happen all


1054
0:35:18,63 --> 0:35:20,502
the time because
I'm saying it.


1055
0:35:20,502 --> 0:35:21,35
FELICIA: I'm going
to do it now.


1056
0:35:21,35 --> 0:35:22,93
VERONICA: It's a first world
problem that I'm complaining


1057
0:35:22,93 --> 0:35:24,72
about first world problems
in hashtag.


1058
0:35:24,72 --> 0:35:26,13
BONNIE: Start the
#vaginalproblems.


1059
0:35:26,13 --> 0:35:27,44
FELICIA: First world problems
is having a


1060
0:35:27,44 --> 0:35:30,905
Twitter account, OK?


1061
0:35:30,905 --> 0:35:33,51
VERONICA: It's like, it's
redundant, we know, we know.


1062
0:35:33,51 --> 0:35:36,68
Everything I complain about on
here is a first world problem.


1063
0:35:36,68 --> 0:35:38,69
Let's just put that out there.


1064
0:35:38,69 --> 0:35:40,97
BONNIE: Maybe we should
do succubus problem.


1065
0:35:40,97 --> 0:35:41,4
VERONICA: Succubus problem.


1066
0:35:41,4 --> 0:35:43,1
FELICIA: Oh, succubus problem.


1067
0:35:43,1 --> 0:35:44,7
BONNIE: Let's do that
as a hashtag.


1068
0:35:44,7 --> 0:35:45,34
Hey, have we trended yet?


1069
0:35:45,34 --> 0:35:48,92
I still think Vaginal Fantasy
needs to trend today.


1070
0:35:48,92 --> 0:35:51,36
If everyone's watching this,
tweet it so it trends.


1071
0:35:51,36 --> 0:35:53,53
Because I don't want people to
be confused because it's a


1072
0:35:53,53 --> 0:35:54,6
football Sunday.


1073
0:35:54,6 --> 0:35:56,75
KIALA: Yeah it's Sunday, there's
nothing else going on.


1074
0:35:56,75 --> 0:35:57,69
Come on.


1075
0:35:57,69 --> 0:35:58,89
FELICIA: There's so much
sportsball talk on there.


1076
0:35:58,89 --> 0:36:2,7
I just don't even check
on Sundays.


1077
0:36:2,7 --> 0:36:3,89
BONNIE: No, it's either Sunday
used to be just football or


1078
0:36:3,89 --> 0:36:4,98
Walking Dead, right?


1079
0:36:4,98 --> 0:36:6,91
That's basically all
Sundays were.


1080
0:36:6,91 --> 0:36:8,59
FELICIA: And awards shows.


1081
0:36:8,59 --> 0:36:9,2
BONNIE: Right.


1082
0:36:9,2 --> 0:36:11,16
VERONICA: I try not to get mad
at the football talk because


1083
0:36:11,16 --> 0:36:12,75
once spring and summer
rolls around it's


1084
0:36:12,75 --> 0:36:13,85
baseball talk for me.


1085
0:36:13,85 --> 0:36:16,2
So I have to let the football
talk happen.


1086
0:36:16,2 --> 0:36:18,3
BONNIE: See, I'm all
about soccer talk.


1087
0:36:18,3 --> 0:36:19,6
VERONICA: Soccer talk.


1088
0:36:19,6 --> 0:36:22,37
That's like early in the
morning, that's like 6 AM.


1089
0:36:22,37 --> 0:36:26,35
I used to live above a bar
that played all of the


1090
0:36:26,35 --> 0:36:28,476
international soccer games,
football games.


1091
0:36:28,476 --> 0:36:29,5
BONNIE: Was it Mad Dog?


1092
0:36:29,5 --> 0:36:30,76
VERONICA: It was Mad Dog.


1093
0:36:30,76 --> 0:36:31,56
It was Mad Dog.


1094
0:36:31,56 --> 0:36:34,12
And I don't live there anymore
so don't go there.


1095
0:36:34,12 --> 0:36:35,69
BONNIE: I was downstairs.


1096
0:36:35,69 --> 0:36:38,68
While you were asleep I was down
at Mad Dog trying to hit


1097
0:36:38,68 --> 0:36:41,63
on every British football fan
in the bar at 6 in the


1098
0:36:41,63 --> 0:36:43,59
morning, and I was not
doing a good job.


1099
0:36:43,59 --> 0:36:45,48
VERONICA: Oh so you mean while
you guys were screaming at the


1100
0:36:45,48 --> 0:36:47,52
top of your lungs at
football games at 6


1101
0:36:47,52 --> 0:36:48,655
o'clock in the morning?


1102
0:36:48,655 --> 0:36:49,66
BONNIE: I have no idea
and I don't even know


1103
0:36:49,66 --> 0:36:50,36
how they play it.


1104
0:36:50,36 --> 0:36:52,8
I just go for the short shorts
and the accents.


1105
0:36:52,8 --> 0:36:53,75
I'm shallow.


1106
0:36:53,75 --> 0:36:56,2
KIALA: Is Mad Dog the one
that's right next to


1107
0:36:56,2 --> 0:36:57,99
Rosamunde's?


1108
0:36:57,99 --> 0:37:0,11
VERONICA: Yeah across
the street.


1109
0:37:0,11 --> 0:37:1,6
Toronado's right next door.


1110
0:37:1,6 --> 0:37:2,913
BONNIE: So if you're in San
Francisco, go to Mad Dog in


1111
0:37:2,913 --> 0:37:5,495
the Fog and you can early
in the morning watch.


1112
0:37:5,495 --> 0:37:7,42
VERONICA: It's like a
weird DJ bar now.


1113
0:37:7,42 --> 0:37:9,83
It got too hip.


1114
0:37:9,83 --> 0:37:11,31
They redid it and it's
not as good.


1115
0:37:11,31 --> 0:37:12,66
But we are way off.


1116
0:37:12,66 --> 0:37:15,83



1117
0:37:15,83 --> 0:37:19,35
FELICIA: If somebody's grading
us they can go to hell.


1118
0:37:19,35 --> 0:37:21,35
BONNIE: Can we do
the casting now?


1119
0:37:21,35 --> 0:37:23,5
Because I had ideas
of who's what.


1120
0:37:23,5 --> 0:37:25,67
FELICIA: Well I did want to
talk about one last thing


1121
0:37:25,67 --> 0:37:30,23
[INAUDIBLE] in Roman, the other
love interest guy who is


1122
0:37:30,23 --> 0:37:31,23
the opposite of Seth.


1123
0:37:31,23 --> 0:37:33,51
He was extremely pushy, he
wouldn't take no for an


1124
0:37:33,51 --> 0:37:35,78
answer, and he ends up
being the bad guy.


1125
0:37:35,78 --> 0:37:39,82
And a lot of people, Erin on the
forums said, I hate Roman,


1126
0:37:39,82 --> 0:37:40,73
I'm halfway through.


1127
0:37:40,73 --> 0:37:43,19
And that was before she even
knew he was a bad guy.


1128
0:37:43,19 --> 0:37:45,26
And the creepy way that
Roman treated people


1129
0:37:45,26 --> 0:37:46,49
sent me crazy vibes.


1130
0:37:46,49 --> 0:37:48,96
They seemed stalkery and rapery,
or was he charming?


1131
0:37:48,96 --> 0:37:52,57
Was the persistence creepy
to anyone else?


1132
0:37:52,57 --> 0:37:53,84
VERONICA: It was a little
creepy at first.


1133
0:37:53,84 --> 0:37:56,95
Well, actually it was creepy
the whole time.


1134
0:37:56,95 --> 0:37:58,26
I thought Roman was a
little bit creepy.


1135
0:37:58,26 --> 0:37:59,62
He came on a little
bit too strong.


1136
0:37:59,62 --> 0:38:1,65
KIALA: Yeah I didn't like that
he walked her home from the


1137
0:38:1,65 --> 0:38:4,25
bar because you shouldn't
ever do that.


1138
0:38:4,25 --> 0:38:5,86
FELICIA: She never should have
had him walk you home.


1139
0:38:5,86 --> 0:38:6,66
KIALA: No.


1140
0:38:6,66 --> 0:38:7,52
VERONICA: Stranger danger.


1141
0:38:7,52 --> 0:38:8,71
KIALA: You get right in a cab.


1142
0:38:8,71 --> 0:38:9,81
No.


1143
0:38:9,81 --> 0:38:11,4
BONNIE: She can take care
of herself though.


1144
0:38:11,4 --> 0:38:12,625
I mean, I don't know.


1145
0:38:12,625 --> 0:38:14,24
She's the one that pointed
him out though.


1146
0:38:14,24 --> 0:38:17,395
She's the one that started all
this mess because she's been


1147
0:38:17,395 --> 0:38:19,66
trying to tell everyone she had
a date, which she didn't.


1148
0:38:19,66 --> 0:38:21,5
VERONICA: But he could
have played it cool.


1149
0:38:21,5 --> 0:38:22,39
I mean, he played it
cool at the time.


1150
0:38:22,39 --> 0:38:24,126
But he could've been like, OK.


1151
0:38:24,126 --> 0:38:24,482
Having fun.


1152
0:38:24,482 --> 0:38:25,56
Bye.


1153
0:38:25,56 --> 0:38:27,13
FELICIA: Well it turns out he
was going to murder her.


1154
0:38:27,13 --> 0:38:29,89
He was going to murder her if
she hadn't have called him


1155
0:38:29,89 --> 0:38:32,39
over to help out with
that conversation.


1156
0:38:32,39 --> 0:38:35,4



1157
0:38:35,4 --> 0:38:37,62
Yeah, I think in the context
of him being a murderer it


1158
0:38:37,62 --> 0:38:39,87
wasn't as creepy.


1159
0:38:39,87 --> 0:38:42,91
But without him being the
murder, had he been a


1160
0:38:42,91 --> 0:38:45,29
legitimate love interest at the
end, I would have said, oh


1161
0:38:45,29 --> 0:38:46,65
that guy's creepy, please
don't go with him.


1162
0:38:46,65 --> 0:38:49,38
But when he turned out to be a
psycho at the end I was like,


1163
0:38:49,38 --> 0:38:50,2
oh, I saw that.


1164
0:38:50,2 --> 0:38:51,5
He wasn't as bad as
he could've been.


1165
0:38:51,5 --> 0:38:54,81



1166
0:38:54,81 --> 0:38:56,8
KIALA: I thought the walking
home from the bar was just


1167
0:38:56,8 --> 0:38:58,32
really presumptuous
and creepy.


1168
0:38:58,32 --> 0:39:3,21
Like you shouldn't ever trust a
dude that wants to do that.


1169
0:39:3,21 --> 0:39:9,32
But other than that, his
persistence wasn't rapey.


1170
0:39:9,32 --> 0:39:10,94
I didn't think it was rapey.


1171
0:39:10,94 --> 0:39:13,35
He didn't try to do anything.


1172
0:39:13,35 --> 0:39:14,83
He respected that.


1173
0:39:14,83 --> 0:39:16,77
He respected that she wasn't
ready to do anything.


1174
0:39:16,77 --> 0:39:19,46
FELICIA: Well considering the
one sex scene in the book, or


1175
0:39:19,46 --> 0:39:23,28
the one of two or three, but
the big one was with him,


1176
0:39:23,28 --> 0:39:26,94
after you find out he's the bad
guy it's a bold writing


1177
0:39:26,94 --> 0:39:28,775
choice which I thought was
kind of refreshing.


1178
0:39:28,775 --> 0:39:31,19
And the fact that she nuanced
his character in a way that


1179
0:39:31,19 --> 0:39:34,1
you weren't like, get
away from him.


1180
0:39:34,1 --> 0:39:36,37
Which I still think that's
really good writing where you


1181
0:39:36,37 --> 0:39:38,7
can have a three dimensional
character like that.


1182
0:39:38,7 --> 0:39:40,26
VERONICA: It's pretty messed up
that he was like, yeah, I


1183
0:39:40,26 --> 0:39:41,23
was going to kill you.


1184
0:39:41,23 --> 0:39:44,47
But then I fell in love with
you so you're fine.


1185
0:39:44,47 --> 0:39:45,39
It's good.


1186
0:39:45,39 --> 0:39:46,81
We should just run
away together.


1187
0:39:46,81 --> 0:39:47,97
BONNIE: That's a spite thing.


1188
0:39:47,97 --> 0:39:49,1
I'm sorry.


1189
0:39:49,1 --> 0:39:50,16
You know what the
funny thing is?


1190
0:39:50,16 --> 0:39:52,85
Is that, I think a lot-- and I'm
going to be presumptuous


1191
0:39:52,85 --> 0:39:55,62
here and I apologize to any
guys that are watching--


1192
0:39:55,62 --> 0:39:58,53
but I think a lot of guys think
that girls want to be


1193
0:39:58,53 --> 0:40:1,16
walked home from bars, and
they want a guy that's a


1194
0:40:1,16 --> 0:40:5,416
little bit more, I don't want
to say forceful but a little


1195
0:40:5,416 --> 0:40:5,91
more aggressive.


1196
0:40:5,91 --> 0:40:10,62
Because I live in a city full
of apathetic hipster dudes


1197
0:40:10,62 --> 0:40:13,8
that could basically take their
pick of chicks, and so


1198
0:40:13,8 --> 0:40:15,81
they don't do any effort.


1199
0:40:15,81 --> 0:40:19,14
So when you see somebody in
a book like that making an


1200
0:40:19,14 --> 0:40:22,16
effort, yeah he came off kind
of creepy, kind of stalkery.


1201
0:40:22,16 --> 0:40:25,73
But when you look at a lot of
romance novels and movies and


1202
0:40:25,73 --> 0:40:28,21
TV shows where the guy's making
that extra effort to


1203
0:40:28,21 --> 0:40:31,76
bring flowers, to find out where
she lives, to offer to


1204
0:40:31,76 --> 0:40:36,3
build her stupid crappy IKEA
bookcase for her, that to me


1205
0:40:36,3 --> 0:40:39,16
seems flirty, not oh my God,
this guy's going to


1206
0:40:39,16 --> 0:40:40,39
kill me in my sleep.


1207
0:40:40,39 --> 0:40:45,22
So maybe I'm just living a
dangerous life, but I thought


1208
0:40:45,22 --> 0:40:48,4
it was cute that he was a little
bit more aggressive


1209
0:40:48,4 --> 0:40:50,74
instead of her having to
chase down everybody.


1210
0:40:50,74 --> 0:40:53,19
VERONICA: SMH Bonnie, SMH.


1211
0:40:53,19 --> 0:40:55,84
Which means apparently
shaking my head.


1212
0:40:55,84 --> 0:40:57,59
KIALA: Oh maybe that's
what it means.


1213
0:40:57,59 --> 0:41:0,3
VERONICA: That's what the
YouTubers tell me.


1214
0:41:0,3 --> 0:41:1,37
KIALA: I like So Much Hate.


1215
0:41:1,37 --> 0:41:2,41
That's what I've decided
it means.


1216
0:41:2,41 --> 0:41:4,56
VERONICA: I think it
could be both.


1217
0:41:4,56 --> 0:41:5,96
FELICIA: I'm just going back
to I just think it's good


1218
0:41:5,96 --> 0:41:8,1
writing that you can have these
two interpretations


1219
0:41:8,1 --> 0:41:10,37
where it's definitely like, oh
my God, I hate that guy.


1220
0:41:10,37 --> 0:41:12,61
And he was obviously
a creeper.


1221
0:41:12,61 --> 0:41:13,6
I just think it's
good writing.


1222
0:41:13,6 --> 0:41:15,358
OK, let's do casting.


1223
0:41:15,358 --> 0:41:17,23
BONNIE: OK.


1224
0:41:17,23 --> 0:41:21,48
So Roman, I said Jay Ryan who
plays the guy on Beauty and


1225
0:41:21,48 --> 0:41:24,42
the Beast, because rwar!


1226
0:41:24,42 --> 0:41:25,55
KIALA: Really?


1227
0:41:25,55 --> 0:41:26,42
BONNIE: Yeah.


1228
0:41:26,42 --> 0:41:26,78
FELICIA: Or Roman?


1229
0:41:26,78 --> 0:41:27,29
BONNIE: Who?


1230
0:41:27,29 --> 0:41:29,81
Not the British guy on
Beauty and the Beast.


1231
0:41:29,81 --> 0:41:32,21
The new Beauty and the Beast.


1232
0:41:32,21 --> 0:41:32,94
Roman.


1233
0:41:32,94 --> 0:41:35,2
FELICIA: For Roman?


1234
0:41:35,2 --> 0:41:39,395
BONNIE: Jay Ryan from Beauty and
the Beast is like Roman.


1235
0:41:39,395 --> 0:41:42,17
And Carter, I got Misha stuck
in my head because of


1236
0:41:42,17 --> 0:41:42,95
Supernatural.


1237
0:41:42,95 --> 0:41:44,43
I can't not think of that.


1238
0:41:44,43 --> 0:41:47,84
I mean, Supernatural's always
going to do that to me.


1239
0:41:47,84 --> 0:41:49,12
FELICIA: I'm going to
be on in January.


1240
0:41:49,12 --> 0:41:50,7
January, my episode's on.


1241
0:41:50,7 --> 0:41:51,84
KIALA: Yay.


1242
0:41:51,84 --> 0:41:52,79
BONNIE: You what?


1243
0:41:52,79 --> 0:41:54,37
FELICIA: My episode.


1244
0:41:54,37 --> 0:41:54,813
[INAUDIBLE]


1245
0:41:54,813 --> 0:41:55,52
episode's [INAUDIBLE].


1246
0:41:55,52 --> 0:41:55,89
KIALA: Yay.


1247
0:41:55,89 --> 0:42:0,44
It is always so weird to see you
on episodes that I watch.


1248
0:42:0,44 --> 0:42:2,61
It's amazing but
it's so weird.


1249
0:42:2,61 --> 0:42:4,265
FELICIA: It's a really good
episode, you guys.


1250
0:42:4,265 --> 0:42:7,82
BONNIE: By the way, Jared
is a huge Star Wars fan.


1251
0:42:7,82 --> 0:42:9,83
FELICIA: Oh, that is amazing.


1252
0:42:9,83 --> 0:42:12,66
BONNIE: And he always has his
kid dressed as Yoda on his


1253
0:42:12,66 --> 0:42:15,74
Twitter and it's [INAUDIBLE].


1254
0:42:15,74 --> 0:42:17,29
FELICIA: Both of them
are awesome guys.


1255
0:42:17,29 --> 0:42:18,77
OK, back to it.


1256
0:42:18,77 --> 0:42:19,84
Who was your Seth, Bonnie?


1257
0:42:19,84 --> 0:42:22,49
BONNIE: And then Seth was kind
of hard because Seth was


1258
0:42:22,49 --> 0:42:27,38
supposed to be sort of like
this geeky guy but he was


1259
0:42:27,38 --> 0:42:30,57
attractive, but he was
downplayed quite a bit.


1260
0:42:30,57 --> 0:42:31,32
I don't know.


1261
0:42:31,32 --> 0:42:33,65
I couldn't figure out who
to have for Seth.


1262
0:42:33,65 --> 0:42:38,1



1263
0:42:38,1 --> 0:42:40,72
And then Eva Green
for Georgina.


1264
0:42:40,72 --> 0:42:43,18
FELICIA: I had Eva Green for
Georgina, which is so weird.


1265
0:42:43,18 --> 0:42:49,345
Roman was Richard Grieco
from 21 Jumpstreet.


1266
0:42:49,345 --> 0:42:51,52
BONNIE: Oh my God,
you did not.


1267
0:42:51,52 --> 0:42:54,77
FELICIA: And Seth
was Ira Glass.


1268
0:42:54,77 --> 0:42:56,27
VERONICA: Really?


1269
0:42:56,27 --> 0:42:57,27
FELICIA: Yeah.


1270
0:42:57,27 --> 0:42:57,77
VERONICA: Huh.


1271
0:42:57,77 --> 0:43:0,29
KIALA: Really?


1272
0:43:0,29 --> 0:43:2,41
VERONICA: I can picture Seth
in my head, but he doesn't


1273
0:43:2,41 --> 0:43:4,41
look like any actor that
I can think of.


1274
0:43:4,41 --> 0:43:5,58
KIALA: Ira Glass?


1275
0:43:5,58 --> 0:43:6,475
BONNIE: Ira Glass?


1276
0:43:6,475 --> 0:43:8,9
FELICIA: Ira Glass is cute.


1277
0:43:8,9 --> 0:43:9,67
VERONICA: That's too
cute, I think.


1278
0:43:9,67 --> 0:43:13,1
Ira Glass is too good looking
maybe for Seth.


1279
0:43:13,1 --> 0:43:14,12
And too tall.


1280
0:43:14,12 --> 0:43:15,49
FELICIA: He is cute
and very smart.


1281
0:43:15,49 --> 0:43:17,42
I met him once.


1282
0:43:17,42 --> 0:43:18,392
KIALA: No, he's cute.


1283
0:43:18,392 --> 0:43:20,93
VERONICA: Veronica, what about
the hot British guy that you


1284
0:43:20,93 --> 0:43:23,93
interviewed on Sword and
Laser Joe Acra--


1285
0:43:23,93 --> 0:43:24,53
Acra--


1286
0:43:24,53 --> 0:43:25,45
VERONICA: No, Joe Abercrombie?


1287
0:43:25,45 --> 0:43:25,81
No.


1288
0:43:25,81 --> 0:43:27,8
Too hot.


1289
0:43:27,8 --> 0:43:28,445
FELICIA: No, he's really hot.


1290
0:43:28,445 --> 0:43:30,46
I hung out with him at
the last [INAUDIBLE]


1291
0:43:30,46 --> 0:43:31,63
I was at in Australia.


1292
0:43:31,63 --> 0:43:32,63
He can tan.


1293
0:43:32,63 --> 0:43:33,79
BONNIE: He is so hot.


1294
0:43:33,79 --> 0:43:34,98
VERONICA: He's so hot.


1295
0:43:34,98 --> 0:43:37,7
This is really unprofessional
of me, Bonnie.


1296
0:43:37,7 --> 0:43:38,995
You should not have
brought this up.


1297
0:43:38,995 --> 0:43:39,747
BONNIE: You don't understand.


1298
0:43:39,747 --> 0:43:43,5
I was tweeting at you when you
aired that episode, and it was


1299
0:43:43,5 --> 0:43:44,72
like, hot, hot, hot.


1300
0:43:44,72 --> 0:43:47,61
It's like a running joke in the
Sword and Laser community


1301
0:43:47,61 --> 0:43:49,22
that I think he's really
good looking.


1302
0:43:49,22 --> 0:43:50,6
He's married with children.


1303
0:43:50,6 --> 0:43:51,19
I'm married.


1304
0:43:51,19 --> 0:43:52,28
It's not a thing.


1305
0:43:52,28 --> 0:43:54,25
BONNIE: I would pay good
money to see both


1306
0:43:54,25 --> 0:43:55,62
his sword and laser.


1307
0:43:55,62 --> 0:43:56,95
FELICIA: Whoa.


1308
0:43:56,95 --> 0:43:57,44
BONNIE: Yeah.


1309
0:43:57,44 --> 0:43:59,11
Hot.


1310
0:43:59,11 --> 0:44:1,18
FELICIA: I had an author dinner
where we all went out.


1311
0:44:1,18 --> 0:44:4,86
Rachel Caine and
Trudy Canavan.


1312
0:44:4,86 --> 0:44:6,32
And then him and a couple
of other authors.


1313
0:44:6,32 --> 0:44:6,9
We all went out.


1314
0:44:6,9 --> 0:44:9,23
And then we went really out late
to get dessert at this


1315
0:44:9,23 --> 0:44:11,52
weird dessert cafe in the
middle of Adelaide.


1316
0:44:11,52 --> 0:44:12,7
But it was really fun.


1317
0:44:12,7 --> 0:44:14,84
They're all really cool.


1318
0:44:14,84 --> 0:44:15,43
VERONICA: I like him a lot.


1319
0:44:15,43 --> 0:44:16,52
He's great.


1320
0:44:16,52 --> 0:44:18,12
So I actually have a
casting for once.


1321
0:44:18,12 --> 0:44:20,19
I almost never have castings.


1322
0:44:20,19 --> 0:44:24,1
But Roman for me was Christian
Camargo who played the ice


1323
0:44:24,1 --> 0:44:25,53
truck killer on Dexter.


1324
0:44:25,53 --> 0:44:26,62
He's Dexter's brother.


1325
0:44:26,62 --> 0:44:27,41
KIALA: Oh, his brother.


1326
0:44:27,41 --> 0:44:29,61
VERONICA: Yeah, his brother.


1327
0:44:29,61 --> 0:44:31,85
The kind of handsome
but kind of creepy.


1328
0:44:31,85 --> 0:44:34,58
A little menacing
a little bit.


1329
0:44:34,58 --> 0:44:35,71
Yeah.


1330
0:44:35,71 --> 0:44:36,53
That popped into my head.


1331
0:44:36,53 --> 0:44:37,67
That's why I got all excited
when we started


1332
0:44:37,67 --> 0:44:38,592
talking about casting.


1333
0:44:38,592 --> 0:44:40,49
I'm like, oh my God,
I got one.


1334
0:44:40,49 --> 0:44:41,4
FELICIA: You got one.


1335
0:44:41,4 --> 0:44:42,92
What about you, Kiala?


1336
0:44:42,92 --> 0:44:47,1
KIALA: I pictured Roman
as Michael Fassbender


1337
0:44:47,1 --> 0:44:47,43
because I always do.


1338
0:44:47,43 --> 0:44:48,115
FELICIA: You always do
Michael Fassbender.


1339
0:44:48,115 --> 0:44:48,47
KIALA: I know.


1340
0:44:48,47 --> 0:44:49,286
I know.


1341
0:44:49,286 --> 0:44:51,89
I know.


1342
0:44:51,89 --> 0:44:56,675
And then I pictured Carter, I
think we talked about this but


1343
0:44:56,675 --> 0:44:59,8
we'll just talk about it, Misha
Collins [INAUDIBLE] in


1344
0:44:59,8 --> 0:45:2,86
his persona but I pictured him
as Eric Northman and I can't


1345
0:45:2,86 --> 0:45:6,95
think of the black guy's name
right now, but yeah.


1346
0:45:6,95 --> 0:45:7,67
VERONICA: Sarsgaard.


1347
0:45:7,67 --> 0:45:9,14
KIALA: Sarsgaard.


1348
0:45:9,14 --> 0:45:10,8
VERONICA: Which one, though?


1349
0:45:10,8 --> 0:45:12,32
KIALA: Not Peter.


1350
0:45:12,32 --> 0:45:15,6
Not [INAUDIBLE].


1351
0:45:15,6 --> 0:45:17,3
Something Sarsgaard.


1352
0:45:17,3 --> 0:45:18,41
VERONICA: Alexander?


1353
0:45:18,41 --> 0:45:21,335
KIALA: Alexander Sarsgaard.


1354
0:45:21,335 --> 0:45:23,7
VERONICA: Alex Sarsgaard


1355
0:45:23,7 --> 0:45:29,9
KIALA: And then for Seth,
I don't know.


1356
0:45:29,9 --> 0:45:29,76
BONNIE: I know, right?


1357
0:45:29,76 --> 0:45:31,23
VERONICA: Yeah Seth is hard.


1358
0:45:31,23 --> 0:45:33,78
BONNIE: At first I thought maybe
Seth could be like David


1359
0:45:33,78 --> 0:45:35,9
Tennant with glasses.


1360
0:45:35,9 --> 0:45:37,16
FELICIA: Oh, oh, oh, oh.


1361
0:45:37,16 --> 0:45:38,885
The new Q in James Bond.


1362
0:45:38,885 --> 0:45:40,12
BONNIE: Oh, perfect.


1363
0:45:40,12 --> 0:45:41,4
VERONICA: Oh.


1364
0:45:41,4 --> 0:45:41,68
Wait as who?


1365
0:45:41,68 --> 0:45:43,11
Who as Seth?


1366
0:45:43,11 --> 0:45:44,64
BONNIE: Seth--?


1367
0:45:44,64 --> 0:45:45,533
VERONICA: It's too hot.


1368
0:45:45,533 --> 0:45:46,4
BONNIE: Really?


1369
0:45:46,4 --> 0:45:47,16
VERONICA: Too hot still.


1370
0:45:47,16 --> 0:45:48,4
That guy's really hot.


1371
0:45:48,4 --> 0:45:49,38
FELICIA: No he is really hot.


1372
0:45:49,38 --> 0:45:50,79
KIALA: But I thought
Seth was hot.


1373
0:45:50,79 --> 0:45:51,79
I thought he was cute.


1374
0:45:51,79 --> 0:45:52,287
FELICIA: I think he's hot.


1375
0:45:52,287 --> 0:45:53,15
He can be hot.


1376
0:45:53,15 --> 0:45:54,75
He doesn't have to not be hot.


1377
0:45:54,75 --> 0:45:55,425
BONNIE: He can be hot.


1378
0:45:55,425 --> 0:45:58,39
FELICIA: I think he's a
little older though.


1379
0:45:58,39 --> 0:45:59,76
VERONICA: Yeah, older.


1380
0:45:59,76 --> 0:46:2,77
For some reason I picture him
with sandy brown hair,


1381
0:46:2,77 --> 0:46:5,8
glasses, kind of
stockier build.


1382
0:46:5,8 --> 0:46:7,96
Not thin but not fat either.


1383
0:46:7,96 --> 0:46:10,52
KIALA: Like Zach Galifianakis?


1384
0:46:10,52 --> 0:46:12,302
VERONICA: Too stocky.


1385
0:46:12,302 --> 0:46:14,51
A little too stocky.


1386
0:46:14,51 --> 0:46:17,42
BONNIE: Now I'm picturing him as
Zach, and that's hilarious.


1387
0:46:17,42 --> 0:46:21,135
VERONICA: Not a built guy,
just like a normal dude.


1388
0:46:21,135 --> 0:46:24,2
KIALA: Like a dude, like a
hipster dude in Portland that


1389
0:46:24,2 --> 0:46:24,665
drinks a lot of beer.


1390
0:46:24,665 --> 0:46:29,23
And rides a bike but when he's
drunk so he doesn't really--


1391
0:46:29,23 --> 0:46:30,23
VERONICA: Because in San
Francisco you say hipster dude


1392
0:46:30,23 --> 0:46:32,57
and I think of super
skinny tight jeans.


1393
0:46:32,57 --> 0:46:33,31
KIALA: Not here.


1394
0:46:33,31 --> 0:46:34,14
VERONICA: Not that
kind of guy.


1395
0:46:34,14 --> 0:46:35,39
Like lumberjack hipster.


1396
0:46:35,39 --> 0:46:37,51
KIALA: Lumberjack hipster.


1397
0:46:37,51 --> 0:46:39,94
I built this record store
with my bare hands.


1398
0:46:39,94 --> 0:46:42,5
FELICIA: Just do to Abbot Kinney
in LA, you'll see 55


1399
0:46:42,5 --> 0:46:43,46
Seth's on the street.


1400
0:46:43,46 --> 0:46:44,23
VERONICA: But no beard.


1401
0:46:44,23 --> 0:46:45,94
I don't see him as
having a beard.


1402
0:46:45,94 --> 0:46:48,315
BONNIE: I think he's like
a Wilco kind of hipster.


1403
0:46:48,315 --> 0:46:50,695
KIALA: Oh, Chris Pratt.


1404
0:46:50,695 --> 0:46:51,86
VERONICA: I don't know
who that is.


1405
0:46:51,86 --> 0:46:52,54
KIALA: From Parks
and Recreation.


1406
0:46:52,54 --> 0:46:54,35
BONNIE: Yeah, the dumb guy
who works in [INAUDIBLE].


1407
0:46:54,35 --> 0:46:55,54
VERONICA: Too young looking.


1408
0:46:55,54 --> 0:46:57,1
Too young looking.


1409
0:46:57,1 --> 0:47:0,95
FELICIA: Marie B. says Martin
Freeman on the comments.


1410
0:47:0,95 --> 0:47:2,41
VERONICA: Also too young
looking for me.


1411
0:47:2,41 --> 0:47:3,85
BONNIE: How about Ron Swanson?


1412
0:47:3,85 --> 0:47:5,14
VERONICA: No, too old looking.


1413
0:47:5,14 --> 0:47:5,74
Too mustachey.


1414
0:47:5,74 --> 0:47:7,63
KIALA: I thought of him as young
because he had all the


1415
0:47:7,63 --> 0:47:8,992
t-shirts and stuff.


1416
0:47:8,992 --> 0:47:10,47
FELICIA: Oh, Sam from
True Blood.


1417
0:47:10,47 --> 0:47:12,5
Sam Merlotte.


1418
0:47:12,5 --> 0:47:13,26
VERONICA: Way too handsome.


1419
0:47:13,26 --> 0:47:13,99
Way too handsome.


1420
0:47:13,99 --> 0:47:17,64
KIALA: Sam from True Blood saw
me crying at DragonCon.


1421
0:47:17,64 --> 0:47:19,91
BONNIE: Why were you crying
at DragonCon?


1422
0:47:19,91 --> 0:47:22,99
KIALA: Oh God, I just had some
bad news and I was hiding in


1423
0:47:22,99 --> 0:47:27,36
the kitchens and he walked back
and he saw me crying.


1424
0:47:27,36 --> 0:47:29,44
And then five minutes
later Spike walks


1425
0:47:29,44 --> 0:47:32,545
through and saw me crying.


1426
0:47:32,545 --> 0:47:34,99
BONNIE: Did get a hug?


1427
0:47:34,99 --> 0:47:36,71
VERONICA: They didn't
console you?


1428
0:47:36,71 --> 0:47:37,57
KIALA: No.


1429
0:47:37,57 --> 0:47:39,45
I wanted them too.


1430
0:47:39,45 --> 0:47:41,31
BONNIE: Man, Spike consoling
you at DragonCon?


1431
0:47:41,31 --> 0:47:42,89
You know how many fantasies
that would've


1432
0:47:42,89 --> 0:47:44,8
completed for all of us?


1433
0:47:44,8 --> 0:47:44,766
KIALA: I know.


1434
0:47:44,766 --> 0:47:45,865
Oh wow.


1435
0:47:45,865 --> 0:47:51,14
VERONICA: OK so someone on the
chat said Seth Green as Seth.


1436
0:47:51,14 --> 0:47:53,23
That actually popped into
my head except still


1437
0:47:53,23 --> 0:47:54,2
a little bit stockier.


1438
0:47:54,2 --> 0:47:54,725
BONNIE: Seth's cute though.


1439
0:47:54,725 --> 0:47:55,365
KIALA: Yeah.


1440
0:47:55,365 --> 0:47:57,5
FELICIA: I don't agree with your
vision of Seth but OK.


1441
0:47:57,5 --> 0:47:57,97
VERONICA: OK.


1442
0:47:57,97 --> 0:47:58,27
It's fine.


1443
0:47:58,27 --> 0:47:58,765
It's fine.


1444
0:47:58,765 --> 0:47:59,87
We don't have to agree.


1445
0:47:59,87 --> 0:48:0,57
FELICIA: It's fine.


1446
0:48:0,57 --> 0:48:3,8
BONNIE: I feel creepy for
saying this because I'm


1447
0:48:3,8 --> 0:48:4,99
friends with Seth and I think
of him like a brother.


1448
0:48:4,99 --> 0:48:7,16
But he's still pretty cute.


1449
0:48:7,16 --> 0:48:7,935
He's doable.


1450
0:48:7,935 --> 0:48:11,42
Whereas I think Seth in the
book, that's a stretch.


1451
0:48:11,42 --> 0:48:12,65
FELICIA: Really?


1452
0:48:12,65 --> 0:48:17,73
VERONICA: I wanted Seth in the
book to be cute enough that--


1453
0:48:17,73 --> 0:48:19,57
this is really not
cool to say--


1454
0:48:19,57 --> 0:48:20,766
BONNIE: Say it.


1455
0:48:20,766 --> 0:48:24,14
VERONICA: Like not an immediate
overwhelming


1456
0:48:24,14 --> 0:48:24,69
attraction.


1457
0:48:24,69 --> 0:48:25,87
The way that Georgina felt.


1458
0:48:25,87 --> 0:48:26,64
Not like, oh wow.


1459
0:48:26,64 --> 0:48:27,84
This guy's really hot.


1460
0:48:27,84 --> 0:48:31,34
But more like, you're attractive
and I'm really


1461
0:48:31,34 --> 0:48:32,32
getting to know you.


1462
0:48:32,32 --> 0:48:34,88
And I feel like we really
connect on a brain level.


1463
0:48:34,88 --> 0:48:37,79
And so I'm beginning to get more
attracted to you through


1464
0:48:37,79 --> 0:48:40,15
our mutual respect for
similar interests.


1465
0:48:40,15 --> 0:48:41,9
BONNIE: So smart's
the new sexy.


1466
0:48:41,9 --> 0:48:44,18
VERONICA: Yeah, and then all
of the sudden you find


1467
0:48:44,18 --> 0:48:46,76
yourself finding that
physical attraction.


1468
0:48:46,76 --> 0:48:48,63
Maybe it wasn't there at the
beginning but it kind of


1469
0:48:48,63 --> 0:48:49,355
develops over time.


1470
0:48:49,355 --> 0:48:51,94
BONNIE: Someone on Twitter,
Jem on Twitter said Anton


1471
0:48:51,94 --> 0:48:55,24
Yelchin from Star Trek
could be Seth.


1472
0:48:55,24 --> 0:48:57,338
The new Star Trek.


1473
0:48:57,338 --> 0:48:58,77
I don't know.


1474
0:48:58,77 --> 0:49:0,51
FELICIA: Wait let's move on
because we want to talk about


1475
0:49:0,51 --> 0:49:1,52
Dragon Actually.


1476
0:49:1,52 --> 0:49:3,3
VERONICA: Is he Chekov from
the new Star Trek?


1477
0:49:3,3 --> 0:49:3,5
BONNIE: Yeah.


1478
0:49:3,5 --> 0:49:4,592
KIALA: Yeah.


1479
0:49:4,592 --> 0:49:5,515
FELICIA: Who read
Dragon Actually?


1480
0:49:5,515 --> 0:49:6,82
BONNIE: I did.


1481
0:49:6,82 --> 0:49:7,15
KIALA: I read half.


1482
0:49:7,15 --> 0:49:8,22
BONNIE: Look at those abs.


1483
0:49:8,22 --> 0:49:9,62
FELICIA: We all read
most of it.


1484
0:49:9,62 --> 0:49:10,43
OK.


1485
0:49:10,43 --> 0:49:11,5
So what did we think
of this one?


1486
0:49:11,5 --> 0:49:16,17
This was the alt book and I want
to read just the blurb.


1487
0:49:16,17 --> 0:49:19,35
"It's not always easy being a
female warrior with a nickname


1488
0:49:19,35 --> 0:49:20,99
like Annwyl the Bloody.


1489
0:49:20,99 --> 0:49:23,66
Men tend to cower in
fear or salute.


1490
0:49:23,66 --> 0:49:26,31
But for once it would be nice to
talk to a real man the way


1491
0:49:26,31 --> 0:49:28,53
she can talk to Fearghus
the Destroyer."


1492
0:49:28,53 --> 0:49:29,71
VERONICA: Too bad Fearghus--


1493
0:49:29,71 --> 0:49:31,425
KIALA: Fergus.


1494
0:49:31,425 --> 0:49:32,23
VERONICA: Fearghus.


1495
0:49:32,23 --> 0:49:33,511
KIALA: Fearghus.


1496
0:49:33,511 --> 0:49:35,47
FELICIA: Fearghus
in the dragon.


1497
0:49:35,47 --> 0:49:38,3
And with him Annwyl
feels safe.


1498
0:49:38,3 --> 0:49:40,36
But there's a twist.


1499
0:49:40,36 --> 0:49:40,84
Blah blah blah.


1500
0:49:40,84 --> 0:49:41,29
OK.


1501
0:49:41,29 --> 0:49:46,35
So basically it's kind of a
medieval book about a girl who


1502
0:49:46,35 --> 0:49:48,63
has a loving relationship
with a dragon.


1503
0:49:48,63 --> 0:49:50,72
And then this knight
comes in and he's


1504
0:49:50,72 --> 0:49:52,85
like Mr. Sex On Wheels.


1505
0:49:52,85 --> 0:49:54,612
Turns out, same guy.


1506
0:49:54,612 --> 0:49:54,99
BONNIE: Look at those abs.


1507
0:49:54,99 --> 0:49:57,43
VERONICA: I doubt she
did a dragon.


1508
0:49:57,43 --> 0:49:59,96
She did did a dragon.


1509
0:49:59,96 --> 0:50:2,34
FELICIA: So what do we think
of this book Veronica?


1510
0:50:2,34 --> 0:50:3,53
You start this one.


1511
0:50:3,53 --> 0:50:7,3
VERONICA: So it was
really funny.


1512
0:50:7,3 --> 0:50:10,8
Well first of all I got a big
kick of the fact that it is


1513
0:50:10,8 --> 0:50:16,46
medieval kind of feel, but they
totally speak regular.


1514
0:50:16,46 --> 0:50:18,14
Like they're hanging out at
the coffee shop down the


1515
0:50:18,14 --> 0:50:19,61
street style talking.


1516
0:50:19,61 --> 0:50:22,5
Which is fine sometimes, but it
just didn't really fit with


1517
0:50:22,5 --> 0:50:25,37
the setting all that much.


1518
0:50:25,37 --> 0:50:26,21
FELICIA: There was somebody--


1519
0:50:26,21 --> 0:50:29,27
I have to read this quote--


1520
0:50:29,27 --> 0:50:31,95
somebody said that it felt
like it was kind


1521
0:50:31,95 --> 0:50:32,99
of out of the eighties.


1522
0:50:32,99 --> 0:50:35,382
Like everybody just had
really big hair.


1523
0:50:35,382 --> 0:50:37,9
Like it came out in 2008
but it felt like


1524
0:50:37,9 --> 0:50:39,4
a massive 80s vibe.


1525
0:50:39,4 --> 0:50:40,9
It was Claire.


1526
0:50:40,9 --> 0:50:42,85
All the hair band maids, or
the dragons were rocking.


1527
0:50:42,85 --> 0:50:45,3
VERONICA: Well how stupid was
she to not realize that it was


1528
0:50:45,3 --> 0:50:46,565
the same guy?


1529
0:50:46,565 --> 0:50:47,96
It took forever.


1530
0:50:47,96 --> 0:50:51,52
It took freaking forever.


1531
0:50:51,52 --> 0:50:53,26
BONNIE: It was such a Lois
Lane moment where


1532
0:50:53,26 --> 0:50:54,44
you're like, come on.


1533
0:50:54,44 --> 0:50:57,33
It's so obvious.


1534
0:50:57,33 --> 0:50:57,63
FELICIA: OK.


1535
0:50:57,63 --> 0:50:58,16
Keep going.


1536
0:50:58,16 --> 0:51:1,53
Sorry, I'm interrupting.


1537
0:51:1,53 --> 0:51:3,4
VERONICA: I also thought that
the book was going to be a lot


1538
0:51:3,4 --> 0:51:5,55
longer because I was reading
it on Kindle and there's


1539
0:51:5,55 --> 0:51:8,15
actually two books in
the Kindle addition.


1540
0:51:8,15 --> 0:51:11,88
So I was like, what else are
they going to put in this book


1541
0:51:11,88 --> 0:51:12,872
[INAUDIBLE]?


1542
0:51:12,872 --> 0:51:16,57
How much more can they talk
about this storyline?


1543
0:51:16,57 --> 0:51:17,3
There's two books.


1544
0:51:17,3 --> 0:51:20,56
There's the story of the mother
dragon and her mother


1545
0:51:20,56 --> 0:51:24,2
that kicks off at the end
of the dragon book.


1546
0:51:24,2 --> 0:51:25,5
KIALA: Oh well we then I thought
we read more of this


1547
0:51:25,5 --> 0:51:26,64
than I thought I did.


1548
0:51:26,64 --> 0:51:26,97
FELICIA: Yeah you did.


1549
0:51:26,97 --> 0:51:30,995
It's only 60% of the Kindle is
the book that was the alt.


1550
0:51:30,995 --> 0:51:32,6
KIALA: Oh I was almost done.


1551
0:51:32,6 --> 0:51:35,49
FELICIA: Yeah it really
goes on forever.


1552
0:51:35,49 --> 0:51:36,98
BONNIE: And so I don't know
what you're talking about


1553
0:51:36,98 --> 0:51:38,92
because I still don't
own a Kindle.


1554
0:51:38,92 --> 0:51:40,49
So I just read real books.


1555
0:51:40,49 --> 0:51:41,71
FELICIA: Bonnie I need to
send you my Kindle.


1556
0:51:41,71 --> 0:51:42,3
I have a Kindle 2.


1557
0:51:42,3 --> 0:51:43,81
I'll send it to you this
week, I promise.


1558
0:51:43,81 --> 0:51:46,625
BONNIE: But then I won't be able
to touch the abs while


1559
0:51:46,625 --> 0:51:47,67
I'm reading.


1560
0:51:47,67 --> 0:51:48,65
VERONICA: Yeah.


1561
0:51:48,65 --> 0:51:48,98
FELICIA: True.


1562
0:51:48,98 --> 0:51:50,96
VERONICA: You can't show
off on Muni with a


1563
0:51:50,96 --> 0:51:51,77
Kindle quite the same.


1564
0:51:51,77 --> 0:51:53,67
BONNIE: Oh I make a lot of
friends on Muni by the way.


1565
0:51:53,67 --> 0:51:57,7
When I read this book on Muni
last time I get hit on a lot


1566
0:51:57,7 --> 0:51:57,52
by cray cray.


1567
0:51:57,52 --> 0:51:59,28
Cray.


1568
0:51:59,28 --> 0:52:0,59
KIALA: Is that good?


1569
0:52:0,59 --> 0:52:1,32
BONNIE: I don't know.


1570
0:52:1,32 --> 0:52:6,5
But I was reading this and this
burly guy sat next to me


1571
0:52:6,5 --> 0:52:8,49
and was like, oh that book
looks interesting.


1572
0:52:8,49 --> 0:52:9,22
What's it about?


1573
0:52:9,22 --> 0:52:11,225
Dragon Actually, is it
like Love, Actually?


1574
0:52:11,225 --> 0:52:12,95
And I'm like, well kind of.


1575
0:52:12,95 --> 0:52:15,15
I was like, it's a dragon
and he said she's--


1576
0:52:15,15 --> 0:52:15,84
VERONICA: [INAUDIBLE]


1577
0:52:15,84 --> 0:52:18,26
He's a dude, and actually
he's a dragon.


1578
0:52:18,26 --> 0:52:18,52
BONNIE: Yeah.


1579
0:52:18,52 --> 0:52:21,4
So I'm trying to avoid
it, right?


1580
0:52:21,4 --> 0:52:24,6
And he just looks at me like,
oh this girl's easy.


1581
0:52:24,6 --> 0:52:26,94



1582
0:52:26,94 --> 0:52:29,11
FELICIA: OK Kiala, what
did you think?


1583
0:52:29,11 --> 0:52:30,95
KIALA: Sorry [INAUDIBLE].


1584
0:52:30,95 --> 0:52:33,768
That's my boyfriend but actually
he's a dragon.


1585
0:52:33,768 --> 0:52:35,22
VERONICA: Actually,
yeah, he is.


1586
0:52:35,22 --> 0:52:36,14
He's a dragon.


1587
0:52:36,14 --> 0:52:39,82
KIALA: He's totally a dragon.


1588
0:52:39,82 --> 0:52:41,86
VERONICA: Oh my God, you
guys, actually we've


1589
0:52:41,86 --> 0:52:43,43
totally been dating.


1590
0:52:43,43 --> 0:52:44,142
Totally a dragon.


1591
0:52:44,142 --> 0:52:45,42
KIALA: I'm actually a dragon.


1592
0:52:45,42 --> 0:52:47,232
VERONICA: Totally a dragon.


1593
0:52:47,232 --> 0:52:48,138
FELICIA: Kiala, what
did you think?


1594
0:52:48,138 --> 0:52:48,591
What did you think?


1595
0:52:48,591 --> 0:52:49,497
KIALA: OK.


1596
0:52:49,497 --> 0:52:52,87
I thought it was really silly.


1597
0:52:52,87 --> 0:52:55,278
But the sex scenes
were really good.


1598
0:52:55,278 --> 0:52:56,242
FELICIA: Oh my God.


1599
0:52:56,242 --> 0:52:57,206
Veronica snorted.


1600
0:52:57,206 --> 0:52:58,17
BONNIE: Oh wow.


1601
0:52:58,17 --> 0:52:59,37
Veronica's drunk.


1602
0:52:59,37 --> 0:53:1,72
FELICIA: She snorted so hard.


1603
0:53:1,72 --> 0:53:4,7
KIALA: She did it again.


1604
0:53:4,7 --> 0:53:5,9
She did it again.


1605
0:53:5,9 --> 0:53:6,916
VERONICA: Yeah but
[INAUDIBLE].


1606
0:53:6,916 --> 0:53:8,166
FELICIA: What's going on?


1607
0:53:8,166 --> 0:53:11,38



1608
0:53:11,38 --> 0:53:12,88
We're so drunk right now.


1609
0:53:12,88 --> 0:53:15,7
KIALA: But you guys,
he'll light your


1610
0:53:15,7 --> 0:53:16,95
cigarette with his face.


1611
0:53:16,95 --> 0:53:21,665



1612
0:53:21,665 --> 0:53:24,145
VERONICA: I don't even have to
drive on the 405 anymore


1613
0:53:24,145 --> 0:53:27,52
because I fly on him, because
he's a dragon.


1614
0:53:27,52 --> 0:53:28,84
Isn't that amazing?


1615
0:53:28,84 --> 0:53:29,73
KIALA: But you know what?


1616
0:53:29,73 --> 0:53:32,216
He totally found out when I
wasn't a virgin anymore.


1617
0:53:32,216 --> 0:53:34,16
BONNIE: Oh my God.


1618
0:53:34,16 --> 0:53:35,41
KIALA: Um--


1619
0:53:35,41 --> 0:53:37,81



1620
0:53:37,81 --> 0:53:40,1
BONNIE: We all need to be
twirling our hair when


1621
0:53:40,1 --> 0:53:41,61
he talk like that.


1622
0:53:41,61 --> 0:53:43,58
Oh yeah, it is so
embarrassing.


1623
0:53:43,58 --> 0:53:45,43
I can't believe it.


1624
0:53:45,43 --> 0:53:49,49
FELICIA: Bonnie what did
you think of the book?


1625
0:53:49,49 --> 0:53:51,88
BONNIE: Aside from it
being crazy jail--


1626
0:53:51,88 --> 0:53:56,615
like crazy bait on Muni, OK
first of all, let me tell you


1627
0:53:56,615 --> 0:53:58,36
something about this dragon.


1628
0:53:58,36 --> 0:54:1,13
I was turned on by the dragon,
here I'm doing this.


1629
0:54:1,13 --> 0:54:2,56
I was turned on by the dragon.


1630
0:54:2,56 --> 0:54:4,69
You know why I was turned
on by the dragon?


1631
0:54:4,69 --> 0:54:8,33
Because he has a freaking
library in his cave.


1632
0:54:8,33 --> 0:54:9,46
VERONICA: That is awesome.


1633
0:54:9,46 --> 0:54:10,53
KIALA: Yeah.


1634
0:54:10,53 --> 0:54:13,59
BONNIE: If you want to get me
turned on, have a whole room


1635
0:54:13,59 --> 0:54:15,61
full of books.


1636
0:54:15,61 --> 0:54:16,25
That will turn me on.


1637
0:54:16,25 --> 0:54:18,1
I don't care if you're
a dragon.


1638
0:54:18,1 --> 0:54:19,8
I don't care if you're
a succubus.


1639
0:54:19,8 --> 0:54:20,45
I don't care if you're
a Republican.


1640
0:54:20,45 --> 0:54:21,365
Well maybe Republican.


1641
0:54:21,365 --> 0:54:23,975
But [INAUDIBLE].


1642
0:54:23,975 --> 0:54:24,442
Well no.


1643
0:54:24,442 --> 0:54:26,82
If you're a hot Republican
dragon with a library, I'm


1644
0:54:26,82 --> 0:54:28,2
willing to look over that.


1645
0:54:28,2 --> 0:54:30,23
Seriously.


1646
0:54:30,23 --> 0:54:31,71
KIALA: Depends on what's
in your library.


1647
0:54:31,71 --> 0:54:35,32
BONNIE: And he picked
out books for her.


1648
0:54:35,32 --> 0:54:35,67
Come on.


1649
0:54:35,67 --> 0:54:36,76
That is hot.


1650
0:54:36,76 --> 0:54:37,3
That is hot.


1651
0:54:37,3 --> 0:54:38,91
FELICIA: It was hot as the
dragon, but what about the


1652
0:54:38,91 --> 0:54:39,49
knight part?


1653
0:54:39,49 --> 0:54:43,5
There was a lot of
sex in this book.


1654
0:54:43,5 --> 0:54:44,5
VERONICA: It was kind
of intense.


1655
0:54:44,5 --> 0:54:46,61
BONNIE: Yeah thanks for the
sex book because that


1656
0:54:46,61 --> 0:54:47,41
fulfilled a lot.


1657
0:54:47,41 --> 0:54:47,96
FELICIA: See.


1658
0:54:47,96 --> 0:54:49,4
Everybody talked
that wanted it.


1659
0:54:49,4 --> 0:54:50,45
Gave it to you.


1660
0:54:50,45 --> 0:54:52,81
BONNIE: Yeah I appreciated
having a book


1661
0:54:52,81 --> 0:54:55,545
full of sex and dragons.


1662
0:54:55,545 --> 0:54:56,664
[INAUDIBLE]


1663
0:54:56,664 --> 0:54:58,48
dragon sex, actually.


1664
0:54:58,48 --> 0:55:1,79
I don't know why they left
that out of the title.


1665
0:55:1,79 --> 0:55:3,99
VERONICA: Dragon sex better
than dinosaur sex.


1666
0:55:3,99 --> 0:55:4,64
KIALA: Actually.


1667
0:55:4,64 --> 0:55:5,12
VERONICA: Actually.


1668
0:55:5,12 --> 0:55:6,16
BONNIE: Yeah.


1669
0:55:6,16 --> 0:55:7,4
[INAUDIBLE]


1670
0:55:7,4 --> 0:55:8,65
vanilla oil.


1671
0:55:8,65 --> 0:55:13,71



1672
0:55:13,71 --> 0:55:15,97
FELICIA: And Emily on the forums
on the question was


1673
0:55:15,97 --> 0:55:17,38
like, does Vaginal
Fantasy have to


1674
0:55:17,38 --> 0:55:19,36
be good to be adorable?


1675
0:55:19,36 --> 0:55:23,3
Because I think it's a perfect
description of the book.


1676
0:55:23,3 --> 0:55:26,89
Just don't even criticize
it, guys.


1677
0:55:26,89 --> 0:55:31,7
Somebody was like, they were
watching an '80s dragon movie


1678
0:55:31,7 --> 0:55:33,1
and they're like, I can
do this better.


1679
0:55:33,1 --> 0:55:33,6
Oh wait I won't.


1680
0:55:33,6 --> 0:55:34,18
I'll do it [INAUDIBLE].


1681
0:55:34,18 --> 0:55:34,68
BONNIE: Which one?


1682
0:55:34,68 --> 0:55:36,18
Was it Krull?


1683
0:55:36,18 --> 0:55:37,38
FELICIA: It was Krull.


1684
0:55:37,38 --> 0:55:38,64
KIALA: Krull is amazing.


1685
0:55:38,64 --> 0:55:39,36
BONNIE: I love Krull


1686
0:55:39,36 --> 0:55:40,44
KIALA: Krull is amazing.


1687
0:55:40,44 --> 0:55:41,1
BONNIE: That would
be so great.


1688
0:55:41,1 --> 0:55:41,805
Krull is awesome.


1689
0:55:41,805 --> 0:55:45,8
It has everything you could
possibly need and Liam Neeson.


1690
0:55:45,8 --> 0:55:46,0
FELICIA: Huge hair.


1691
0:55:46,0 --> 0:55:47,6
That girl has huge hair.


1692
0:55:47,6 --> 0:55:48,796
KIALA: Oh, it is so good.


1693
0:55:48,796 --> 0:55:50,595
With her little face?


1694
0:55:50,595 --> 0:55:50,97
BONNIE: Yeah.


1695
0:55:50,97 --> 0:55:51,96
FELICIA: Yeah.


1696
0:55:51,96 --> 0:55:54,165
But I hated the word toerag.


1697
0:55:54,165 --> 0:55:56,37
Does anybody remember that?


1698
0:55:56,37 --> 0:55:58,39
KIALA: Yes.


1699
0:55:58,39 --> 0:55:59,87
FELICIA: I read it four
or five times in


1700
0:55:59,87 --> 0:56:0,71
the book as an insult.


1701
0:56:0,71 --> 0:56:2,16
I'm like, what is going on?


1702
0:56:2,16 --> 0:56:4,415
What is a toerag?


1703
0:56:4,415 --> 0:56:5,665
What is a toerag?


1704
0:56:5,665 --> 0:56:8,58



1705
0:56:8,58 --> 0:56:10,54
KIALA: Why would you have
a rag on your toe?


1706
0:56:10,54 --> 0:56:12,2
And why is that an insult?


1707
0:56:12,2 --> 0:56:13,74
VERONICA: Alright toerag.


1708
0:56:13,74 --> 0:56:15,24
Toerag.


1709
0:56:15,24 --> 0:56:18,24
FELICIA: It's literally six or
seven times in this book.


1710
0:56:18,24 --> 0:56:19,63
Somebody calls you,
you toerag.


1711
0:56:19,63 --> 0:56:20,26
KIALA: Yeah.


1712
0:56:20,26 --> 0:56:22,76
BONNIE: Yeah.


1713
0:56:22,76 --> 0:56:24,4
KIALA: The first time I read
it, I read it as kind of


1714
0:56:24,4 --> 0:56:26,53
Scottish or something
like [INAUDIBLE]


1715
0:56:26,53 --> 0:56:27,66
or something like a name.


1716
0:56:27,66 --> 0:56:30,1
And I was like, oh, toerag.


1717
0:56:30,1 --> 0:56:31,39
FELICIA: No, it was an insult.


1718
0:56:31,39 --> 0:56:34,17
VERONICA: You you toerag.


1719
0:56:34,17 --> 0:56:36,13
KIALA: [INAUDIBLE] for
moving, you toerag.


1720
0:56:36,13 --> 0:56:38,59
But it wasn't like that.


1721
0:56:38,59 --> 0:56:39,21
That's a bad accent.


1722
0:56:39,21 --> 0:56:41,12
VERONICA: What does that
mean, you guys?


1723
0:56:41,12 --> 0:56:42,13
It's a rascal.


1724
0:56:42,13 --> 0:56:44,26
OK, they say it's a rascal.


1725
0:56:44,26 --> 0:56:45,14
FELICIA: What's a rascal?


1726
0:56:45,14 --> 0:56:46,63
Is that a known insult?


1727
0:56:46,63 --> 0:56:48,65
A rapscallion is a toerag?


1728
0:56:48,65 --> 0:56:50,71
I've never heard that.


1729
0:56:50,71 --> 0:56:52,83
KIALA: The little thing that
fat people ride around on?


1730
0:56:52,83 --> 0:56:54,68
FELICIA: A lot of people
in the comments know


1731
0:56:54,68 --> 0:56:55,46
what a toerag is.


1732
0:56:55,46 --> 0:56:58,45
VERONICA: Yeah YouTubers
know what toerag means.


1733
0:56:58,45 --> 0:56:59,5
Is it from the '80s?


1734
0:56:59,5 --> 0:57:1,6
--Someone says.


1735
0:57:1,6 --> 0:57:3,6
A scoundrel, like a scumbag.


1736
0:57:3,6 --> 0:57:5,17
They're saying on IRC now.


1737
0:57:5,17 --> 0:57:6,96
FELICIA: Scumbag?


1738
0:57:6,96 --> 0:57:8,1
Is it a British thing?


1739
0:57:8,1 --> 0:57:10,79
VERONICA: But what
does it mean?


1740
0:57:10,79 --> 0:57:12,35
KIALA: Where is the etymology?


1741
0:57:12,35 --> 0:57:13,44
FELICIA: Oh it's British.


1742
0:57:13,44 --> 0:57:15,344
It's British means scum.


1743
0:57:15,344 --> 0:57:16,232
BONNIE: Oh.


1744
0:57:16,232 --> 0:57:17,12
VERONICA: But why?


1745
0:57:17,12 --> 0:57:18,69
But why?


1746
0:57:18,69 --> 0:57:19,58
FELICIA: That's a whole
different question.


1747
0:57:19,58 --> 0:57:21,3
KIALA: Maybe you can't afford
socks and so you put


1748
0:57:21,3 --> 0:57:22,13
rags on your feet.


1749
0:57:22,13 --> 0:57:23,19
BONNIE: Yeah there you go.


1750
0:57:23,19 --> 0:57:24,21
It's a Cockney thing.


1751
0:57:24,21 --> 0:57:24,81
FELICIA: I don't buy it.


1752
0:57:24,81 --> 0:57:26,94
KIALA: So you put rags
on your feet.


1753
0:57:26,94 --> 0:57:28,73
BONNIE: It's probably Cockney.


1754
0:57:28,73 --> 0:57:29,7
FELICIA: I don't buy it.


1755
0:57:29,7 --> 0:57:30,48
BONNIE: I don't know.


1756
0:57:30,48 --> 0:57:33,38
FELICIA: There was also
a lot of spanking.


1757
0:57:33,38 --> 0:57:34,38
VERONICA: There was
a lot of spanking.


1758
0:57:34,38 --> 0:57:35,51
But spanking's kind of hot.


1759
0:57:35,51 --> 0:57:36,615
BONNIE: That was good though.


1760
0:57:36,615 --> 0:57:37,79
FELICIA: It wasn't
bad spanking but


1761
0:57:37,79 --> 0:57:40,55
it was copious spanking.


1762
0:57:40,55 --> 0:57:41,3
BONNIE: Really?


1763
0:57:41,3 --> 0:57:41,98
Copious?


1764
0:57:41,98 --> 0:57:42,86
KIALA: There was a
lot of spanking.


1765
0:57:42,86 --> 0:57:43,3
BONNIE: OK.


1766
0:57:43,3 --> 0:57:43,67
KIALA: [INAUDIBLE]


1767
0:57:43,67 --> 0:57:44,66
Veronica.


1768
0:57:44,66 --> 0:57:47,62
FELICIA: There was a toerag's
worth of spanking.


1769
0:57:47,62 --> 0:57:49,73
VERONICA: That's a unit
of measurement?


1770
0:57:49,73 --> 0:57:51,16
FELICIA: I don't know.


1771
0:57:51,16 --> 0:57:52,82
I don't know anymore.


1772
0:57:52,82 --> 0:57:54,21
VERONICA: A metric toerag.


1773
0:57:54,21 --> 0:57:56,19
BONNIE: I don't think there's
such a thing as copious


1774
0:57:56,19 --> 0:57:57,81
spanking, is there?


1775
0:57:57,81 --> 0:58:0,435
FELICIA: I mean, it depends
on your level of spanking.


1776
0:58:0,435 --> 0:58:1,67
BONNIE: I don't know.


1777
0:58:1,67 --> 0:58:3,51
FELICIA: OK Pixie Fleming 89.


1778
0:58:3,51 --> 0:58:6,5
The definition of toerag derives
from Old England where


1779
0:58:6,5 --> 0:58:8,6
convicts used to tie bits of
shirt around their toes and


1780
0:58:8,6 --> 0:58:9,79
feet as makeshift socks.


1781
0:58:9,79 --> 0:58:13,35
Hence toerag means criminal
or rapscallion.


1782
0:58:13,35 --> 0:58:14,6
KIALA: See?


1783
0:58:14,6 --> 0:58:15,64
I figured that out.


1784
0:58:15,64 --> 0:58:17,56
FELICIA: You did.


1785
0:58:17,56 --> 0:58:19,14
KIALA: Well I just saw
Les Miserables, so


1786
0:58:19,14 --> 0:58:20,51
it's probably in there.


1787
0:58:20,51 --> 0:58:21,21
VERONICA: [INAUDIBLE]


1788
0:58:21,21 --> 0:58:23,963
I don't have time to Google
things, jeez.


1789
0:58:23,963 --> 0:58:24,75
FELICIA: [INAUDIBLE]


1790
0:58:24,75 --> 0:58:26,14
Anne Hathaway.


1791
0:58:26,14 --> 0:58:28,82
KIALA: Literally I almost passed
out from trying not to


1792
0:58:28,82 --> 0:58:30,84
cry because my mom was
sitting next to me


1793
0:58:30,84 --> 0:58:33,6
sobbing like a baby.


1794
0:58:33,6 --> 0:58:38,24
I was trying to not hold it in
and I almost passed out.


1795
0:58:38,24 --> 0:58:41,36
BONNIE: Am I bad if I just
pretended Le Mis was a


1796
0:58:41,36 --> 0:58:42,25
Wolverine prequel?


1797
0:58:42,25 --> 0:58:43,48
VERONICA: You keep saying that.


1798
0:58:43,48 --> 0:58:44,34
OK.


1799
0:58:44,34 --> 0:58:45,32
So I went.


1800
0:58:45,32 --> 0:58:48,44
I tried to go, and our
theater broke down.


1801
0:58:48,44 --> 0:58:50,46
FELICIA: I saw you said
that on Twitter.


1802
0:58:50,46 --> 0:58:51,34
VERONICA: You did.


1803
0:58:51,34 --> 0:58:52,7
It was terrible.


1804
0:58:52,7 --> 0:58:54,1
I love you Bonnie.


1805
0:58:54,1 --> 0:58:55,26
But you already made
that joke.


1806
0:58:55,26 --> 0:58:57,69
And I really love Les Mis so
it hurts me in my guts.


1807
0:58:57,69 --> 0:58:58,245
BONNIE: You know what?


1808
0:58:58,245 --> 0:59:0,3
It's really [INAUDIBLE] on Les
Mis, it's a [INAUDIBLE]


1809
0:59:0,3 --> 0:59:1,42
on Wolverine.


1810
0:59:1,42 --> 0:59:2,5
VERONICA: OK.


1811
0:59:2,5 --> 0:59:2,42
All right.


1812
0:59:2,42 --> 0:59:4,43
We can agree on that then.


1813
0:59:4,43 --> 0:59:5,73
FELICIA: The last half of Les
Mis was kind of a snoozer.


1814
0:59:5,73 --> 0:59:5,92
OK?


1815
0:59:5,92 --> 0:59:8,5
But the first half
was excellent.


1816
0:59:8,5 --> 0:59:9,13
VERONICA: I haven't
seen it yet.


1817
0:59:9,13 --> 0:59:11,78
Because I tried to go and
I couldn't see it.


1818
0:59:11,78 --> 0:59:15,56
KIALA: It is just the sobbiest
sobb, sobb, sobby sobby.


1819
0:59:15,56 --> 0:59:20,3
Everyone in the entire theater
is just crying out loud.


1820
0:59:20,3 --> 0:59:22,43
VERONICA: We saw Book of
Mormon last night.


1821
0:59:22,43 --> 0:59:22,91
It was pretty good.


1822
0:59:22,91 --> 0:59:24,23
KIALA: Oh, was it funny?


1823
0:59:24,23 --> 0:59:25,16
VERONICA: It was really funny.


1824
0:59:25,16 --> 0:59:26,12
It was really funny.


1825
0:59:26,12 --> 0:59:27,945
BONNIE: Hey Felicia, when you
said that Anne Hathaway should


1826
0:59:27,945 --> 0:59:30,71
win the Oscar, I thought
you meant for Catwoman.


1827
0:59:30,71 --> 0:59:32,71
FELICIA: I think half the
people that follow me on


1828
0:59:32,71 --> 0:59:35,13
Twitter actually believe that.


1829
0:59:35,13 --> 0:59:37,333
KIALA: She was really
good in Batman.


1830
0:59:37,333 --> 0:59:38,3
VERONICA: She was good.


1831
0:59:38,3 --> 0:59:38,99
FELICIA: OK.


1832
0:59:38,99 --> 0:59:41,41
Guys, before we wrap up, there
was a couple of questions


1833
0:59:41,41 --> 0:59:44,17
because I think we've done
Dragon Actually, all right?


1834
0:59:44,17 --> 0:59:46,26
You guys will know what you're
going to get into when you get


1835
0:59:46,26 --> 0:59:46,9
Dragon Actually.


1836
0:59:46,9 --> 0:59:48,85
There are a couple of just
general questions people


1837
0:59:48,85 --> 0:59:52,4
posted on the thread.


1838
0:59:52,4 --> 0:59:53,79
This is our year anniversary.


1839
0:59:53,79 --> 0:59:54,985
Well I guess next month.


1840
0:59:54,985 --> 0:59:56,83
We started in January.


1841
0:59:56,83 --> 0:59:58,3
And this is the end
of the year.


1842
0:59:58,3 --> 1:0:1,91
So as a couple of reflection
questions, what would your new


1843
1:0:1,91 --> 1:0:6,17
year Vaginal Fantasy
resolution be?


1844
1:0:6,17 --> 1:0:8,28
KIALA: To drink more.


1845
1:0:8,28 --> 1:0:9,23
FELICIA: OK.


1846
1:0:9,23 --> 1:0:10,48
KIALA: I don't know.


1847
1:0:10,48 --> 1:0:15,226



1848
1:0:15,226 --> 1:0:18,0
Maybe I will try to always
read The Ultimate.


1849
1:0:18,0 --> 1:0:20,44
Because I really have no
excuse not to read it.


1850
1:0:20,44 --> 1:0:20,9
FELICIA: Yeah.


1851
1:0:20,9 --> 1:0:23,8
Oh that's a good one.


1852
1:0:23,8 --> 1:0:26,52
I'm going to try to pick
more books that I


1853
1:0:26,52 --> 1:0:29,18
haven't read before.


1854
1:0:29,18 --> 1:0:31,62
Oh I want to poll
the forums more.


1855
1:0:31,62 --> 1:0:33,19
Because these were
forum picks.


1856
1:0:33,19 --> 1:0:35,4
You guys voted on the forums.


1857
1:0:35,4 --> 1:0:37,47
So I'm thinking maybe
every other month


1858
1:0:37,47 --> 1:0:39,15
we'll do you guys pick.


1859
1:0:39,15 --> 1:0:39,57
I don't know.


1860
1:0:39,57 --> 1:0:41,25
KIALA: Yeah I think that
would be great.


1861
1:0:41,25 --> 1:0:41,7
BONNIE: Yeah.


1862
1:0:41,7 --> 1:0:42,49
VERONICA: That's a good idea.


1863
1:0:42,49 --> 1:0:44,34
FELICIA: Because I always feel
such incredible guilt.


1864
1:0:44,34 --> 1:0:45,79
We all picked one in a month.


1865
1:0:45,79 --> 1:0:48,11
And you feel like you
disappointed your friends.


1866
1:0:48,11 --> 1:0:48,96
It's like, oh no.


1867
1:0:48,96 --> 1:0:50,6
People don't like my book.


1868
1:0:50,6 --> 1:0:50,395
VERONICA: Yes.


1869
1:0:50,395 --> 1:0:51,9
FELICIA: It takes
such pressure.


1870
1:0:51,9 --> 1:0:55,58
So I think if we do every other
month the forum gets to


1871
1:0:55,58 --> 1:0:57,77
pick the books.


1872
1:0:57,77 --> 1:1:0,51
Oh and actually next month
is a forum pick as well.


1873
1:1:0,51 --> 1:1:2,28
Because it didn't go with
this one as an alt.


1874
1:1:2,28 --> 1:1:5,32
So I picked one and three and
then number two is going to be


1875
1:1:5,32 --> 1:1:6,77
the book next month.


1876
1:1:6,77 --> 1:1:9,11
BONNIE: I think it's a good idea
because when we do our


1877
1:1:9,11 --> 1:1:11,67
meetups, well when Veronica and
I did the meetup in San


1878
1:1:11,67 --> 1:1:15,2
Francisco, everyone that was
there had really good


1879
1:1:15,2 --> 1:1:17,99
suggestions of books
we should read.


1880
1:1:17,99 --> 1:1:19,96
And so I feel like leaving
it up to the


1881
1:1:19,96 --> 1:1:21,64
forums is a good idea.


1882
1:1:21,64 --> 1:1:24,42
FELICIA: Yeah and it might be
best to have people be able to


1883
1:1:24,42 --> 1:1:28,26
do write-ins and see what
people are voting for.


1884
1:1:28,26 --> 1:1:30,53
It'll just be a public discourse
over the month.


1885
1:1:30,53 --> 1:1:33,83
So that way even if you don't
have one to volunteer other


1886
1:1:33,83 --> 1:1:38,42
people can write one
in and post it.


1887
1:1:38,42 --> 1:1:40,61
You could change your
vote too to see.


1888
1:1:40,61 --> 1:1:43,22
So we'll be able to have a
really good process where it's


1889
1:1:43,22 --> 1:1:44,21
not a surprise.


1890
1:1:44,21 --> 1:1:45,65
So that will be my--


1891
1:1:45,65 --> 1:1:50,69
Also, what was your favorite
book of the year?


1892
1:1:50,69 --> 1:1:52,8
And were there any books
that you regretted


1893
1:1:52,8 --> 1:1:54,2
reading this year?


1894
1:1:54,2 --> 1:1:55,526
BONNIE: Oh.


1895
1:1:55,526 --> 1:1:58,715
You mean from our group
or just in general?


1896
1:1:58,715 --> 1:2:1,74
FELICIA: Just in general.


1897
1:2:1,74 --> 1:2:2,51
VERONICA: The worst book.


1898
1:2:2,51 --> 1:2:4,96
Oh that's hard.


1899
1:2:4,96 --> 1:2:6,18
There were some stinkers.


1900
1:2:6,18 --> 1:2:8,37
KIALA: Yeah.


1901
1:2:8,37 --> 1:2:10,295
FELICIA: I feel the most bad
about that sci-fi one, the


1902
1:2:10,295 --> 1:2:11,16
Linnea Sinclair one.


1903
1:2:11,16 --> 1:2:12,44
KIALA: That's the one I
was thinking about.


1904
1:2:12,44 --> 1:2:13,27
The space one?


1905
1:2:13,27 --> 1:2:15,56
FELICIA: Yeah because that was
such a bad book and she's a


1906
1:2:15,56 --> 1:2:16,94
much better author than that.


1907
1:2:16,94 --> 1:2:19,9
And I wish I had picked the book
that I wanted to pick,


1908
1:2:19,9 --> 1:2:21,775
Hope's Folly, because that is a
great book and we would all


1909
1:2:21,775 --> 1:2:22,54
have enjoyed it more.


1910
1:2:22,54 --> 1:2:24,67
And I picked her first book
because I was worried about


1911
1:2:24,67 --> 1:2:26,81
continuity which didn't
really apply either.


1912
1:2:26,81 --> 1:2:29,39
And I picked one that didn't
represent her as an author as


1913
1:2:29,39 --> 1:2:31,77
well as I could have.


1914
1:2:31,77 --> 1:2:32,49
VERONICA: Yeah I can't
think of which one


1915
1:2:32,49 --> 1:2:33,49
was my least favorite.


1916
1:2:33,49 --> 1:2:34,78
That was up there.


1917
1:2:34,78 --> 1:2:35,9
That was up there.


1918
1:2:35,9 --> 1:2:37,79
But I think that my resolution
is going to be to make sure I


1919
1:2:37,79 --> 1:2:41,51
take more notes on lines and
things that I like while I'm


1920
1:2:41,51 --> 1:2:43,66
reading so I can call them
out later on the show.


1921
1:2:43,66 --> 1:2:46,2
And also to really practice
with my casting.


1922
1:2:46,2 --> 1:2:47,14
I've got to get on
the casting.


1923
1:2:47,14 --> 1:2:48,57
BONNIE: You don't have
to do that, Veronica.


1924
1:2:48,57 --> 1:2:49,89
That's just something I do.


1925
1:2:49,89 --> 1:2:52,82
VERONICA: I actually get anxiety
the day of the show.


1926
1:2:52,82 --> 1:2:55,83
I'm like, I haven't thought
of any casting.


1927
1:2:55,83 --> 1:2:58,18
BONNIE: That's why I like
Pinterest because if you want,


1928
1:2:58,18 --> 1:3:0,94
when you're on Pinterest you
just pin hot guys that you


1929
1:3:0,94 --> 1:3:1,73
think would work well.


1930
1:3:1,73 --> 1:3:5,38
And then you have this already
ready to go so when we do Vag


1931
1:3:5,38 --> 1:3:8,3
Fan you can just look at
it and go, oh that guy.


1932
1:3:8,3 --> 1:3:8,62
VERONICA: Yeah.


1933
1:3:8,62 --> 1:3:8,98
FELICIA: Yeah.


1934
1:3:8,98 --> 1:3:10,91
No it's a very nice board
you have there.


1935
1:3:10,91 --> 1:3:11,86
I have to say, I was like, oh.


1936
1:3:11,86 --> 1:3:13,11
This could solve a lot
of my problems.


1937
1:3:13,11 --> 1:3:15,93



1938
1:3:15,93 --> 1:3:17,66
BONNIE: If any of you follow
me on Pinterest you'll see


1939
1:3:17,66 --> 1:3:21,62
that I have a Benedict
Cumberbatch problem.


1940
1:3:21,62 --> 1:3:22,6
KIALA: Yes.


1941
1:3:22,6 --> 1:3:24,11
And on Tumbler.


1942
1:3:24,11 --> 1:3:25,54
BONNIE: And on Tumbler.


1943
1:3:25,54 --> 1:3:26,775
KIALA: Thanks a lot.


1944
1:3:26,775 --> 1:3:29,87
My Tumbler dash is all
Cumberbatch all the time


1945
1:3:29,87 --> 1:3:30,53
because [INAUDIBLE].


1946
1:3:30,53 --> 1:3:31,266
BONNIE: Sorry.


1947
1:3:31,266 --> 1:3:32,54
I can't help it.


1948
1:3:32,54 --> 1:3:34,45
I'm so excited for Star
Trek that I just--


1949
1:3:34,45 --> 1:3:37,9
I-- oh man.


1950
1:3:37,9 --> 1:3:39,9
FELICIA: Oh did you have casting
for Dragon Actually?


1951
1:3:39,9 --> 1:3:40,906
I had casting.


1952
1:3:40,906 --> 1:3:41,39
BONNIE: Well let's see.


1953
1:3:41,39 --> 1:3:42,47
What's your casting?


1954
1:3:42,47 --> 1:3:45,83
FELICIA: Jessica Biel
and The Rock.


1955
1:3:45,83 --> 1:3:47,24
VERONICA: I love The Rock.


1956
1:3:47,24 --> 1:3:48,975
I love The Rock.


1957
1:3:48,975 --> 1:3:50,95
FELICIA: I was just like,
I want to see them.


1958
1:3:50,95 --> 1:3:51,84
They're amazing.


1959
1:3:51,84 --> 1:3:53,39
They're both amazing.


1960
1:3:53,39 --> 1:3:54,75
VERONICA: What's that
new movie he's going


1961
1:3:54,75 --> 1:3:55,92
to be in with Marky--


1962
1:3:55,92 --> 1:3:57,52
KIALA: Mark Whalberg.


1963
1:3:57,52 --> 1:3:58,745
FELICIA: Yeah Mark Whalberg.


1964
1:3:58,745 --> 1:3:59,6
KIALA: I forget what
it's called.


1965
1:3:59,6 --> 1:4:0,472
VERONICA: Marky-Mark.


1966
1:4:0,472 --> 1:4:1,36
KIALA: Or Fighters.


1967
1:4:1,36 --> 1:4:3,95
BONNIE: I have a hard time
picturing what the dragon


1968
1:4:3,95 --> 1:4:5,11
should-- hmm.


1969
1:4:5,11 --> 1:4:8,8
I think the guy maybe from
Arrow but with long hair.


1970
1:4:8,8 --> 1:4:10,43
FELICIA: Oh, with '80s hair?


1971
1:4:10,43 --> 1:4:10,735
BONNIE: Yeah.


1972
1:4:10,735 --> 1:4:11,38
With '80s hair.


1973
1:4:11,38 --> 1:4:14,42
But '80s hair is such a turn off
for me with guys if it's


1974
1:4:14,42 --> 1:4:16,722
not like John Cusack,
feathered hair.


1975
1:4:16,722 --> 1:4:19,86
KIALA: What if it was just
like Adrian Paul from


1976
1:4:19,86 --> 1:4:21,66
Highlander, the series?


1977
1:4:21,66 --> 1:4:23,96
BONNIE: Yeah.


1978
1:4:23,96 --> 1:4:25,9
FELICIA: A comment on the forums
that made me laugh a


1979
1:4:25,9 --> 1:4:28,26
lot about Dragon Actually, Megan
says, it was like the


1980
1:4:28,26 --> 1:4:30,25
author watched Dragon Heart
and thought, you know what


1981
1:4:30,25 --> 1:4:31,4
this needs?


1982
1:4:31,4 --> 1:4:31,71
More nipples.


1983
1:4:31,71 --> 1:4:33,515
And for Dennis Quaid
to be a woman.


1984
1:4:33,515 --> 1:4:34,7
BONNIE: Yeah.


1985
1:4:34,7 --> 1:4:35,94
Yeah.


1986
1:4:35,94 --> 1:4:37,116
Actually.


1987
1:4:37,116 --> 1:4:38,8
That's a good idea.


1988
1:4:38,8 --> 1:4:39,43
Or not even Dragon Heart.


1989
1:4:39,43 --> 1:4:42,4
What's the other one with
Christian Bale?


1990
1:4:42,4 --> 1:4:43,752
KIALA: Oh, Rain of Fire.


1991
1:4:43,752 --> 1:4:45,165
Rain of Fire.


1992
1:4:45,165 --> 1:4:46,514
BONNIE: I love that movie.


1993
1:4:46,514 --> 1:4:47,906
KIALA: That's a really
good movie.


1994
1:4:47,906 --> 1:4:50,38
FELICIA: It's amazingly
bad and amazing.


1995
1:4:50,38 --> 1:4:52,19
Why don't they make more
movies like that?


1996
1:4:52,19 --> 1:4:52,86
BONNIE: I know, right?


1997
1:4:52,86 --> 1:4:55,45
I miss dragon movies.


1998
1:4:55,45 --> 1:4:58,65
KIALA: Oh, and Christian Bale
as the dragon would be nice.


1999
1:4:58,65 --> 1:4:58,42
BONNIE: Yeah.


2000
1:4:58,42 --> 1:5:1,35
That's what I was thinking
because of that movie.


2001
1:5:1,35 --> 1:5:3,14
KIALA: Because he's
got the beard.


2002
1:5:3,14 --> 1:5:3,885
BONNIE: Yeah.


2003
1:5:3,885 --> 1:5:6,38
Like a scruffy, scruffy
Christian Bale.


2004
1:5:6,38 --> 1:5:7,22
I don't know.


2005
1:5:7,22 --> 1:5:7,98
I like dragon movies.


2006
1:5:7,98 --> 1:5:8,755
I wish they'd make more.


2007
1:5:8,755 --> 1:5:9,47
FELICIA: They should.


2008
1:5:9,47 --> 1:5:11,36
It's a really high
quality choice.


2009
1:5:11,36 --> 1:5:14,29
There needs to be more
everything like that.


2010
1:5:14,29 --> 1:5:19,91
BONNIE: So my Vaginal Fantasy
goal this year.


2011
1:5:19,91 --> 1:5:23,7
Don't focus so much on the
comments, I guess, on our


2012
1:5:23,7 --> 1:5:24,71
YouTube channel.


2013
1:5:24,71 --> 1:5:28,275
Even though I'm programmed
to answer every question.


2014
1:5:28,275 --> 1:5:31,3
I'll try not to take things
personally when the people


2015
1:5:31,3 --> 1:5:35,28
tell me to shut my
big old face.


2016
1:5:35,28 --> 1:5:38,9
And I don't really have
a least favorite book.


2017
1:5:38,9 --> 1:5:42,57
Because even the crappy books
we've read for Vag Fan I've


2018
1:5:42,57 --> 1:5:44,79
liked them because you've
gotten me to read more.


2019
1:5:44,79 --> 1:5:47,36
So I'm just thankful that
I'm reading more.


2020
1:5:47,36 --> 1:5:50,71
And then I'm just thankful that
I'm in this group and


2021
1:5:50,71 --> 1:5:53,6
that I got you guys all
to read Cthulhurotica.


2022
1:5:53,6 --> 1:5:54,31
VERONICA: Yay.


2023
1:5:54,31 --> 1:5:55,545
FELICIA: That was a good pick.


2024
1:5:55,545 --> 1:5:56,385
KIALA: Yeah and I
enjoyed that.


2025
1:5:56,385 --> 1:5:58,29
Oh also I'm going
to talk more.


2026
1:5:58,29 --> 1:6:1,38



2027
1:6:1,38 --> 1:6:2,75
I'm trying.


2028
1:6:2,75 --> 1:6:3,54
Shy.


2029
1:6:3,54 --> 1:6:4,705
FELICIA: Your hair looks
excellent too


2030
1:6:4,705 --> 1:6:4,96
today, by the way.


2031
1:6:4,96 --> 1:6:5,43
KIALA: Oh.


2032
1:6:5,43 --> 1:6:6,1
Thank you.


2033
1:6:6,1 --> 1:6:6,96
BONNIE: It does.


2034
1:6:6,96 --> 1:6:7,74
FELICIA: You're quite welcome.


2035
1:6:7,74 --> 1:6:9,48
OK we're going to wrap it up.


2036
1:6:9,48 --> 1:6:13,84
Next month's hangout is
on January 29 at 8 PM.


2037
1:6:13,84 --> 1:6:15,76
We're going back to
Tuesday nights.


2038
1:6:15,76 --> 1:6:18,9
Although this afternoon was
kind of fun actually.


2039
1:6:18,9 --> 1:6:18,52
BONNIE: I like this.


2040
1:6:18,52 --> 1:6:19,17
VERONICA: It was fun.


2041
1:6:19,17 --> 1:6:19,83
KIALA: It was nice.


2042
1:6:19,83 --> 1:6:20,86
And good lighting.


2043
1:6:20,86 --> 1:6:22,35
FELICIA: Yeah it's very
good lighting.


2044
1:6:22,35 --> 1:6:23,27
We're all very alert.


2045
1:6:23,27 --> 1:6:25,71
And then a lot of people in
Europe were able to tune in


2046
1:6:25,71 --> 1:6:27,59
for the first time.


2047
1:6:27,59 --> 1:6:29,675
VERONICA: The problem is now
that I'm drunk at 3 o'clock in


2048
1:6:29,675 --> 1:6:30,169
the afternoon.


2049
1:6:30,169 --> 1:6:32,923
KIALA: Yeah me too.


2050
1:6:32,923 --> 1:6:36,22
BONNIE: Honestly, I'm glad that
we did this because I


2051
1:6:36,22 --> 1:6:40,31
like seeing you guys
in daylight.


2052
1:6:40,31 --> 1:6:44,68
And also the fact that all of
our UK and Europe fans get to


2053
1:6:44,68 --> 1:6:47,31
watch us because I'm a
huge Anglophile so


2054
1:6:47,31 --> 1:6:48,32
that's kind of hot.


2055
1:6:48,32 --> 1:6:50,76
FELICIA: Well if you guys start
a thread on the forums


2056
1:6:50,76 --> 1:6:53,35
about the time we could talk
amongst ourselves if there's


2057
1:6:53,35 --> 1:6:57,99
any flexibility with moving.


2058
1:6:57,99 --> 1:6:59,975
Just start a thread on the
forums and we'll discuss it.


2059
1:6:59,975 --> 1:7:4,51
And then our next month's book
is the number two polled pick


2060
1:7:4,51 --> 1:7:6,5
that you guys voted
for this month.


2061
1:7:6,5 --> 1:7:10,18
It is Outlander, by Diana
Gabaldon which is being


2062
1:7:10,18 --> 1:7:13,89
adapted by Ron Moore for a TV
show which is kind of cool.


2063
1:7:13,89 --> 1:7:19,21
And as an alt pick, I picked
In Bed With A Highlander by


2064
1:7:19,21 --> 1:7:21,78
Maya Banks.


2065
1:7:21,78 --> 1:7:23,28
Extremely smutty.


2066
1:7:23,28 --> 1:7:23,98
BONNIE: Really?


2067
1:7:23,98 --> 1:7:24,96
VERONICA: Nice.


2068
1:7:24,96 --> 1:7:26,56
FELICIA: Well Outlander
is such a meaty book.


2069
1:7:26,56 --> 1:7:29,27
It's kind of like
Crucial Start.


2070
1:7:29,27 --> 1:7:31,94
I don't know if we'll actually
get to the alt to discuss it


2071
1:7:31,94 --> 1:7:35,24
because Outlander is pretty
thick and intense.


2072
1:7:35,24 --> 1:7:36,6
But I'll try.


2073
1:7:36,6 --> 1:7:39,9
But anyway, for you guys'
enjoyment, it's a much less


2074
1:7:39,9 --> 1:7:41,35
serious version of
the Highlander.


2075
1:7:41,35 --> 1:7:43,99



2076
1:7:43,99 --> 1:7:46,37
BONNIE: The author of Outlander
is pretty excited


2077
1:7:46,37 --> 1:7:48,21
that we're reading it
for Vag Fan too.


2078
1:7:48,21 --> 1:7:48,85
FELICIA: Oh really?


2079
1:7:48,85 --> 1:7:49,71
Oh that's great.


2080
1:7:49,71 --> 1:7:52,65
VERONICA: No pressure.


2081
1:7:52,65 --> 1:7:55,46
KIALA: I've always wanted
to read this book too.


2082
1:7:55,46 --> 1:7:58,916
I've picked it up so many times
since I was like 17.


2083
1:7:58,916 --> 1:8:0,66
Has it been out that long?


2084
1:8:0,66 --> 1:8:1,5
I don't know.


2085
1:8:1,5 --> 1:8:1,97
I'm old.


2086
1:8:1,97 --> 1:8:3,634
FELICIA: [INAUDIBLE] you are.


2087
1:8:3,634 --> 1:8:4,52
OK.


2088
1:8:4,52 --> 1:8:5,33
Well thanks you guys.


2089
1:8:5,33 --> 1:8:7,74
We'll see you next month,
January 29.


2090
1:8:7,74 --> 1:8:8,915
VERONICA: I've got go hang
out with [INAUDIBLE].


2091
1:8:8,915 --> 1:8:10,35
And [INAUDIBLE] too.


2092
1:8:10,35 --> 1:8:11,36
FELICIA: Oh yeah.


2093
1:8:11,36 --> 1:8:12,32
All right bye guys!


2094
1:8:12,32 --> 1:8:13,57
KIALA: Goodbye.


2095
1:8:13,57 --> 1:10:13,57
