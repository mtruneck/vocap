1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:35,64



2
0:0:35,64 --> 0:0:37,385
HARVEY FOSTER: You have to
believe in traveling.


3
0:0:37,385 --> 0:0:41,36



4
0:0:41,36 --> 0:0:44,68
You've got to go out
and do stuff.


5
0:0:44,68 --> 0:0:45,92
Of course I've had fun.


6
0:0:45,92 --> 0:0:47,38
I have fun everywhere, man.


7
0:0:47,38 --> 0:0:51,3
Every single spot we went to
there's something to remember.


8
0:0:51,3 --> 0:0:54,8
Like when my bike broke down.


9
0:0:54,8 --> 0:0:58,85
The roughest moments
you remember a lot.


10
0:0:58,85 --> 0:1:2,37
Well, at least my fucking bike
broke down on the Baja and not


11
0:1:2,37 --> 0:1:4,16
in Victoria.


12
0:1:4,16 --> 0:1:9,152
The day before though, I knew
my bike was running hard.


13
0:1:9,152 --> 0:1:10,506
I need that wrench.


14
0:1:10,506 --> 0:1:11,76
It's too loose.


15
0:1:11,76 --> 0:1:15,44
We rode for half an hour, people
started passing me


16
0:1:15,44 --> 0:1:18,62
because I wanted to slow
down and just enjoy it.


17
0:1:18,62 --> 0:1:19,81
So I got all that out of me.


18
0:1:19,81 --> 0:1:22,39
And fucking, the Canadians
are behind me--


19
0:1:22,39 --> 0:1:23,26
Ky and Keegan.


20
0:1:23,26 --> 0:1:25,9
He pulls up beside me and
I was smoking man.


21
0:1:25,9 --> 0:1:27,66
I was smoking.


22
0:1:27,66 --> 0:1:29,16
KYNAN TAIT: I don't know.


23
0:1:29,16 --> 0:1:31,68
He was ahead of us and we pulled
over and there was just


24
0:1:31,68 --> 0:1:31,96
oil everywhere.


25
0:1:31,96 --> 0:1:35,191
He was leaking oil last night,
and then it just looked it


26
0:1:35,191 --> 0:1:36,441
blew up today.


27
0:1:36,441 --> 0:1:40,351



28
0:1:40,351 --> 0:1:44,16
HARVEY FOSTER: A man's always
got to push his bike.


29
0:1:44,16 --> 0:1:45,502
That's sick, hey?


30
0:1:45,502 --> 0:1:47,26
That was dope.


31
0:1:47,26 --> 0:1:49,1
I don't know, I wanted
to push my bike.


32
0:1:49,1 --> 0:1:50,99
I got a moment with
her right now.


33
0:1:50,99 --> 0:1:55,51
And he knows I don't have many
possessions in life except for


34
0:1:55,51 --> 0:1:56,915
my motorcycle.


35
0:1:56,915 --> 0:1:59,34
And he makes fun of me for being
a free spirit-- yeah,


36
0:1:59,34 --> 0:2:1,39
I'll go whatever, do whatever.


37
0:2:1,39 --> 0:2:6,36
But I'm going to sound like a
total typical Harley Davidson


38
0:2:6,36 --> 0:2:9,479
dude, but my bike is my life.


39
0:2:9,479 --> 0:2:13,51
When my bike broke down, Keegan
handed me the machete.


40
0:2:13,51 --> 0:2:15,48
All right, cool.


41
0:2:15,48 --> 0:2:20,17
It's not like all my anger
and all my shit is gone.


42
0:2:20,17 --> 0:2:21,84
But it was like, whatever, make


43
0:2:21,84 --> 0:2:23,56
the best of the situation.


44
0:2:23,56 --> 0:2:24,835
I like the way this
guy thinks.


45
0:2:24,835 --> 0:2:28,33



46
0:2:28,33 --> 0:2:32,99
Got my fucking captain
right there, with me.


47
0:2:32,99 --> 0:2:36,91
Actually, I like that you
were there a lot.


48
0:2:36,91 --> 0:2:39,62
I was really fucking stoked.


49
0:2:39,62 --> 0:2:42,69
I don't know if that's like a
teary moment or something for


50
0:2:42,69 --> 0:2:44,81
people who don't know
me and this guy.


51
0:2:44,81 --> 0:2:47,46
But we kind of do a lot
of shit together.


52
0:2:47,46 --> 0:2:50,13
So when it broke down I was
like, who else would I want to


53
0:2:50,13 --> 0:2:52,8
be beside me other than
the guy I'd go


54
0:2:52,8 --> 0:2:53,383
across the country with?


55
0:2:53,383 --> 0:2:55,355
KYNAN TAIT: Good riding
with you, Harvey!


56
0:2:55,355 --> 0:3:9,68



57
0:3:9,68 --> 0:3:12,23
HARVEY FOSTER: I didn't
get to do this trip.


58
0:3:12,23 --> 0:3:13,87
Like, I did the trip
a different way.


59
0:3:13,87 --> 0:3:16,54



60
0:3:16,54 --> 0:3:19,38
That's all I think about in the
truck is like, oh man, I


61
0:3:19,38 --> 0:3:22,863
hope we pull over somewhere
where they need gas and we can


62
0:3:22,863 --> 0:3:24,113
skate some.


63
0:3:24,113 --> 0:3:26,508



64
0:3:26,508 --> 0:3:27,758
Yes!


65
0:3:27,758 --> 0:3:39,144



66
0:3:39,144 --> 0:3:42,65
That thing was really tight.


67
0:3:42,65 --> 0:3:45,7
And it sucks, too, because there
was like professional


68
0:3:45,7 --> 0:3:47,61
skateboarders there and
I couldn't do it.


69
0:3:47,61 --> 0:3:49,495
When they could have done
a really good trick.


70
0:3:49,495 --> 0:3:52,57
[SCREAMS]


71
0:3:52,57 --> 0:3:54,96
Heath and Keegan placed a bet
whether I'd do it or not.


72
0:3:54,96 --> 0:3:56,43
Heath said no one could do it.


73
0:3:56,43 --> 0:3:57,72
Keegan said I could do it.


74
0:3:57,72 --> 0:4:0,63
So then when I heard about
that, too, I was like I'm


75
0:4:0,63 --> 0:4:2,8
letting Canada down.


76
0:4:2,8 --> 0:4:5,75
Because we're used to stupid
spots that are really fucking


77
0:4:5,75 --> 0:4:8,385
stupid to skate and we have
to work to skate them.


78
0:4:8,385 --> 0:4:11,645
So I was kind of like fuck,
I blew it there.


79
0:4:11,645 --> 0:4:13,65
But I don't have patience
for things like that.


80
0:4:13,65 --> 0:4:16,79
I don't have patience at all.


81
0:4:16,79 --> 0:4:18,18
If I didn't do it in ten
tries, I was over it.


82
0:4:18,18 --> 0:4:18,48
[INAUDIBLE]?


83
0:4:18,48 --> 0:4:20,24
No way.


84
0:4:20,24 --> 0:4:25,808
It was hot, that's my excuse.


85
0:4:25,808 --> 0:4:29,67
No, I'm over this.


86
0:4:29,67 --> 0:4:33,38
But, I don't know, I think the
next two days are going to be


87
0:4:33,38 --> 0:4:34,62
a lot of fun.


88
0:4:34,62 --> 0:4:36,89
I can even feel it in
the group, too.


89
0:4:36,89 --> 0:4:43,8
Because I think it's been hard
on them riding a lot in hot


90
0:4:43,8 --> 0:4:46,21
weather, bugs, windy roads.


91
0:4:46,21 --> 0:4:49,26
But I think the next few days
are going to be a lot of fun.


92
0:4:49,26 --> 0:4:51,243
This is good to think
about, too.


93
0:4:51,243 --> 0:5:2,75



94
0:5:2,75 --> 0:5:3,865
BILL BRYANT: We're coming
out of Mulege.


95
0:5:3,865 --> 0:5:6,91
It's about 15 miles south
and we rounded a


96
0:5:6,91 --> 0:5:7,495
corner up on a hill.


97
0:5:7,495 --> 0:5:10,17
And looking down onto that
bay, I think everybody's


98
0:5:10,17 --> 0:5:12,99
stoked meter just went
through the roof.


99
0:5:12,99 --> 0:5:14,972
That's what everybody
expects from Baja.


100
0:5:14,972 --> 0:5:17,506
You want to see some crystal
clear water, you want to see a


101
0:5:17,506 --> 0:5:19,13
big, white beach and hardly
anybody there.


102
0:5:19,13 --> 0:5:22,545
And we rode down there and
stripped off our clothes and


103
0:5:22,545 --> 0:5:24,264
ran out in the water
in our underwear.


104
0:5:24,264 --> 0:5:27,236
I think that was an epic point
of the trip, it was just fun.


105
0:5:27,236 --> 0:5:30,8



106
0:5:30,8 --> 0:5:31,79
ARTO SAARI: Sorry about it.


107
0:5:31,79 --> 0:5:34,915
Floating in paradise
with a beer.


108
0:5:34,915 --> 0:5:36,237
I'm sorry.


109
0:5:36,237 --> 0:5:37,211
I'm sorry.


110
0:5:37,211 --> 0:5:40,133
I rode a motorcycle here.


111
0:5:40,133 --> 0:5:41,975
HIME HERBERT: That was insane.


112
0:5:41,975 --> 0:5:43,64
That was like a postcard.


113
0:5:43,64 --> 0:5:49,982
Fuck, man, this is what
I signed up for.


114
0:5:49,982 --> 0:5:53,29
KEEGAN SAUDER: I honestly can't
think of one high point.


115
0:5:53,29 --> 0:5:54,35
Like, it just kind
of blends in.


116
0:5:54,35 --> 0:5:56,0
The whole thing is
pretty magical.


117
0:5:56,0 --> 0:6:2,58
Just the fact that we're all
doing this, the whole thing is


118
0:6:2,58 --> 0:6:3,12
just amazing.


119
0:6:3,12 --> 0:6:6,974
This is like, this is
living right here.


120
0:6:6,974 --> 0:6:10,5
This is how it should be.


121
0:6:10,5 --> 0:6:12,5
I know one day it's going to
end, so I'm definitely trying


122
0:6:12,5 --> 0:6:15,646
to take full advantage of it and
just appreciate the hell


123
0:6:15,646 --> 0:6:16,896
out of it right now.


124
0:6:16,896 --> 0:8:16,896
