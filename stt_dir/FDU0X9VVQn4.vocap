###19 BILL BASS: You get a good, cold day
###21 like this, you don't--
###24 the decay rate is not very rapid.
###26 It's slow.
###28 So it's slowed down on a day like this.
###30 If you were here in the summer, it would
###34 be going gray guts.
###35 
###47 I'm the person that founded what's called the Body Farm,
###50 which is a research facility that we use to find out the
###54 length of time since death or the changes that occur to the
###57 body and how long does it take.
###60 And there are multiple variables, the major factor
###63 being temperature.
###64 So you decay faster in the summer than
###66 you do in the winter.
###67 And you have all the others.
###69 The clothing or no clothing.
###71 And this facility is set up to look at all those variables.
###74 
###77 I came here June the 1st of 1971.
###81 Knew the medical examiner.
###82 The medical examiner asked if I would serve as a forensic
###85 anthropologist for medical examiner system.
###87 And I said yes.
###89 And it wasn't long before bodies started coming in.
###91 And about half of the first 10 cases were
###94 maggot-covered bodies.
###97 And the police don't ask you, who is that?
###100 They ask you, how long have they been there?
###102 I think the reason for that, in the criminal justice system
###105 they're trained the sooner you get on the chase, the more
###107 likely you are to solve the crime.
###109 Well, I didn't know a thing about maggots.
###111 And I looked in the literature and there
###112 really wasn't much there.
###115 And so I thought, we'd better do some research on this.
###119 Because I want know what I'm talking about
###121 when I talk to police.
###123 So I went to the dean in the fall of '71, in November of
###125 '71 I went to the dean.
###127 I said, dean, I need some land to put dead bodies on.
###129 And that was the beginning of the Body Farm.
###131 JON JEFFERSON: He was the first person to have this idea
###136 to research what happens to bodies after
###138 death and when it happens.
###140 And the first person-- or at least the first person to do
###142 something about it.
###143 BILL BASS: We have a number of individuals who will kill
###147 their wives or kill their husbands.
###148 And what do you do with a dead wife or dead husband?
###152 Well, you gotta get rid of it.
###154 But how do you do that?
###155 Well, one of the things is to go out in the yard.
###158 Mainly in the flower garden.
###159 And dig a grave.
###161 And somebody looks out and sees and says, what you doing
###166 over there?
###167 Well, you can't say you're burying your husband.
###169 So you put a concrete slab over it and say you're pouring
###175 a little patio.
###177 We have a lot of bodies buried under things like this in our
###181 culture today.
###182 This was a master's thesis in which we're using ground
###184 penetrating radar to look through the concrete and go
###188 down underneath it.
###190 It's interesting looking at that project over the
###192 nine-month period that this master's thesis ran.
###197 You could see that there was a body under there.
###201 And as time goes by, you can see the body decay.
###205 But normally, if you go out to a crime scene, you wouldn't
###209 get that nine-month sequence.
###210 JON JEFFERSON: He's funny.
###212 He's charming.
###213 He's genuinely good-hearted.
###216 I can imagine that someone without all those attributes
###221 might try to set up a facility like this and just get
###224 nowhere with it.
###225 But he is legendary and beloved in east Tennessee.
###231 BILL BASS: There's a skeleton there that has no cover on it
###236 except for the leaves.
###237 
###240 Here's one of the bones way down here too.
###242 That's a [INAUDIBLE].
###243 
###248 Put it back up there.
###250 
###253 REBECCA WILSON: I handle the William M. Bass Donated
###257 Skeletal Collection.
###258 It is the end product of our donation program.
###262 And those individuals that have willed themselves to our
###266 program to be used for both our decomposition research as
###270 well as the skeletal aspect of our research.
###273 
###279 My name is Rebecca Wilson.
###280 I am the Assistant Coordinator of the Forensic
###283 Anthropology Center.
###286 This collection started in 1981.
###289 And anyone that wills themself to our program to be used for
###294 research at the Anthropological Research
###296 Facility is eventually brought here and is stored here in
###301 perpetuity.
###302 So they are stored-- as long as we exist,
###305 they will be here.
###306 Currently we have just over 700 individuals in the
###311 collection, which makes it the largest collection in the
###314 United States of modern Americans.
###318 It exceeds the next largest program from about 400
###321 individuals.
###322 So it's fairly substantial.
###324 We had individuals where they have been directly
###328 affected by a case.
###330 Whether they were a victim or they had a member of the
###334 family that was a victim.
###336 And those individuals are usually more interested in the
###340 decomposition research.
###342 And they really want to be used as much as possible for
###344 forensic-related research at our research facility.
###350 We also have people that we just want
###352 to be used for teaching.
###354 They're either the individuals that want their skeleton on
###356 display in a classroom, which, obviously we cannot.
###360 And we tell them that having a skeleton restrung or kind of
###365 put back together is not as beneficial for us.
###372 So we have those individuals that are just like, I want to
###375 be used for teaching.
###376 And those individuals that choose that and highlight that
###379 are more of the academics.
###380 A lot of them--
###381 you'll see a lot of nurses and a lot of teachers that say, I
###386 really want to be used for that aspect.
###388 Obviously, when we go on a case, you're starting in your
###390 head putting pieces together.
###391 And know where to look when you get back to that lab.
###395 So to me, having the skeletons available in the collection is
###400 a way so that students can learn what they are expected
###403 to find and know in the field and in the lab situation.
###407 But also be an avenue for research with those age
###411 indicators.
###412 Looking at, OK, the difference between males and females.
###415 Looking at the way we age.
###417 Because those are things that do change with time.
###419 And having a modern collection available to do that is
###422 extremely important.
###425 So we get now--
###427 this past year we've had 26 researchers from other
###431 institutions coming just to use the collection.
###434 And that's amazing.
###435 And the number of requests increases every year.
###440 And so to me, it's a value.
###441 This is a data set.
###443 And it's a resource for other people to use.
###445 
###454 BILL BASS: They're having troubles in courts these days
###458 where the average juror is a member of the community.
###465 And CSI has been so successful that people think if you don't
###471 do it like it's done on CSI then there's
###473 something wrong with you.
###475 And so you've got to convince them, hey.
###478 We don't get it done in an hour.
###480 And it takes a little bit more research than what CSI shows
###486 that's going on.
###487 
###490 We've had a couple of experiments.
###492 We wanted to reproduce death in a trailer to see how long
###496 it takes for a body to decay in a trailer
###499 situation like that.
###500 Occasionally we'll try to reproduce a crime scene which
###504 there's not much in the literature on.
###507 And that was one of the ones that we'd done that.
###512 And there's a body under there.
###516 And the reason we cover them up with black plastic is that
###521 maggots don't like sunlight.
###524 So when a body is out here, and you have it in the sun and
###533 the shade and so forth, the maggots will get on the body.
###537 But they will get down under the skin.
###539 So they will leave the skin as an umbrella.
###542 You will find a body out sometime.
###544 It looks fairly good condition.
###545 But when you get up to that body and look at it very
###547 carefully, you'll find that the skin is just leather.
###552 Literally it has turned to leather.
###554 And there's nothing there but a skeleton
###559 with a leather covering.
###561 And what we're trying to do is to get down to
###566 the skeletal remains.
###568 We put that on there so that the maggots will do a better
###572 job of cleaning the skeletons off.
###575 We have buried here five burials.
###580 When we buried the individuals, we ran pipes down
###584 and ran pipes through the body.
###586 And this is to get the compounds, the volatile fatty
###590 acids that are given off the body.
###592 One of my doctoral students who's doing this project has
###596 found over 500 compounds that are given
###599 off of decaying bodies.
###602 Now not all 500 of those are equal in identifying a body.
###607 But he has designed a sniffer.
###608 A handheld device that you can walk across the ground.
###612 And if you find one of those compounds that he's using in
###617 his data bank, you can tell that there's
###620 a buried body there.
###621 So this is the type of research that we're doing.
###625 Now the next question that comes up.
###627 The reason they're still here.
###628 
###631 Do you get the same compounds given off of a body that's
###634 been dead two years that you get the first year?
###637 We don't know that.
###638 So we left it.
###639 And we're now in the fourth year.
###641 These things have been here four years.
###642 And there are some decreases of some.
###647 But, of course, how long are you going to leave them?
###650 Well, I don't know how long we'll leave them.
###651 It'll depend on when you get a point of diminishing returns.
###657 But we do have individuals--
###659 we do have cadaver dog handlers who say that, oh,
###664 their dogs can smell Civil War graves.
###666 Well, that's 140 years ago.
###673 I don't know.
###675 I wonder a little bit about that.
###678 But we do now have the techniques in forensic
###683 anthropology area that we can go about looking
###686 at things like that.
###687
