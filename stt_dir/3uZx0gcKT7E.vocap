###118 
###123 My girlfriend thinks that I think that I'm famous.
###125 She's always like, just because you've put up a couple
###127 of YouTube videos doesn't mean you say you're the man.
###129 You think you're famous.
###130 'Cause I'll say to her listen, honey, I'm a Z-lister.
###131 I'm a Z-list celebrity, by the way.
###133 You know what I mean?
###134 She's like all right, give us a break.
###137 My girlfriend doesn't even tell her
###138 family that I do wrestling.
###140 She was that affronted.
###141 She was embarrassed, mortified.
###143 She just doesn't like the idea of me in a leotard, jumping
###146 about and kidding and fighting,
###147 which is fair enough.
###148 She hates wrestling.
###149 
###155 See, going to Glasgow is like going into London for me, do
###158 you what I mean?
###158 This is like--
###159 I mean, look at Glasgow now, man.
###160 It's like still a buzz for me to go into Glasgow.
###163 A lot of folk will think it's so stupid man, it's Glasgow.
###166 But because I live next to the sea and live in a wee kind of
###169 seaside town, you come into Glasgow, man, it's still a bit
###172 of a buzz, do you know what I mean?
###174 It's a bit of a buzz.
###175 
###182 FEMALE SPEAKER: Well, it's Mark Dallas'
###184 birthday, good friends.
###185 FEMALE SPEAKER: So everyone's going to get really fucked up.
###188 
###192 FEMALE SPEAKER: I'm the manager of Mikey Whiplash.
###195 FEMALE SPEAKER: She's also a valet, so she comes on and
###197 gets dirty.
###198 FEMALE SPEAKER: I'm just her fan.
###200 I'm the fluffer.
###202 FEMALE SPEAKER: That's fluffing.
###205 Here is real, the blood is real, the pain is real, the
###209 sexy bits are real, it's making it for real.
###211 FEMALE SPEAKER: Buckfast, cider and blood.
###213 FEMALE SPEAKER: And balls.
###214 FEMALE SPEAKER: Oh, well.
###215 FEMALE SPEAKER: All about the balls.
###216 FEMALE SPEAKER: And boobs.
###217 Boobs.
###217 FEMALE SPEAKER: Balls and boobs.
###219 FEMALE SPEAKER: I like this.
###222 FEMALE SPEAKER: ICW attracts the most crazy and the most
###225 daring and individual of talents.
###228 And we all get together and get sexy and kick the fuck out
###231 of each other.
###231 FEMALE SPEAKER: Why you rubbing my back when you could
###233 be rubbing my tits?
###234 
###236 DAVEY BOY: My name is Davey Boy.
###237 WEE MAN: My name's Wee Man.
###238 STEVIE BOY: Stevie Boy.
###239 DAVEY BOY: And together we are The Bucky Boys.
###242 The gimmick is, we're a couple of hard NEDs, a couple of
###245 cheeky bastards from Glasgow.
###247 A NED is a Non-Educated Delinquent.
###250 Say, somebody that doesn't really pay
###251 attention in school.
###253 He more or less gets stoned, fights a lot at
###255 weekends, gets jailed.
###257 Just basically breaches the peace, causes trouble.
###260 STEVIE BOY: We've got the Wee Man and all.
###262 DAVEY BOY: This is the guy that started to do it, do you
###263 know what I mean?
###264 Like, singing his wee songs.
###266 I loved them, they were amazing.
###268 I used to sit there on MSN like, oh, fucking look
###270 at this cunt, man.
###271 This video's amazing.
###272 
###279 DAVEY BOY: Oh, it was brilliant.
###280 Honest to God, one of the best guys to manage.
###282 WEE MAN: The Buckfast is a fortified wine.
###286 I think because it's so highly caffeinated, that's why the
###289 folk drink it.
###290 STEVIE BOY: It's the "wreck the house" juice.
###290 WEE MAN: So not only does it get you steaming, but it gets
###293 you hyper as well.
###294 DAVEY BOY: It's a very well-known drink in Glasgow.
###296 A lot of your junkies, your alkies, your
###298 NEDs, they drink it.
###300 So Dallas decided because that was our gimmick with the NEDs,
###303 he says you'll be called The Bucky Boys.
###306 And we come out with a box of Bucky, we drink it, we get mad
###308 with it while we wrestle, and that is the
###310 best part about it.
###312 WEE MAN: Well, I read somewhere that even though
###314 it's brewed by Benedictine monks in Buckfast Abbey in
###317 Devon, England, about 80% or 85% gets sent to Scotland.
###322 They should be praying to us, not God.
###326 You do get groupies.
###327 DAVEY BOY: "Ring rats," is the Glasgow version for it.
###330 Quasiomos, Sloths, you name it.
###333 WEE MAN: They're not so much belles of the ball as those
###334 that ring the bells.
###334 DAVEY BOY: Ring rats sometimes get done.
###338 
###342 It's like Sauchiehall Street, down there.
###344 Right, this place is packing with clunge.
###347 It's amazing.
###349 We're the Bucky Boys, that's why we're all
###350 dressed like NEDs.
###351 And we're playing there tomorrow night.
###352 FEMALE SPEAKER: Really?
###352 DAVEY BOY: Aye.
###353 We're going to go for a drink if you want to come with.
###355 FEMALE SPEAKER: Uh huh.
###356 FEMALE SPEAKER: Where are you going?
###357 DAVEY BOY: Anywhere we can get in with trackies.
###359 STEVIE BOY: This is how you pull in Glasgow.
###361 Tell lassies to go out and see your poster and then you slip
###363 a pill in their drink, and fuck on.
###365 FEMALE SPEAKER: Oh, have you got that on camera?
###368 FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.
###371 DAVEY BOY: Yeah, they'll fucking believe us now.
###373 There you go, look at that.
###374 FEMALE SPEAKER: That's you!
###375 FEMALE SPEAKER: That's you?
###376 That's actually pretty good though.
###378 DAVEY BOY: Have you got Facebook?
###379 FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.
###380 Hey, what's your name though?
###381 I'll add you right now.
###381 FEMALE SPEAKER: Will you take our names down
###382 and we'll add you?
###383 Thank you!
###385 Bye!
###387 STEVIE BOY: Oh yes.
###387 DAVEY BOY: My boys grow up so fast.
###389 I'm going to fucking shag one of them.
###391 Oof!
###393 Yeah, wrestling's fake alright.
###396 We represent coming out, having a laugh, smashing
###401 people's heads in, getting drunk.
###403 I think a lot of people are like that.
###405 So I think that's why when we come out, everybody loves us.
###407 STEVIE BOY: I don't care who you are, what you say, what
###409 your background is, everybody was a NED at one point.
###411 You hung out at the park, you smoked dope, you drink.
###415 You had a good time with your pals, you had a laugh.
###416 I think it just kind of brings back
###418 those memories to everybody.
###419 Before you went into your working life and you were
###422 working the 9-5, just doing the same
###424 mundane piss every day.
###425 All my family were NEDs, my brothers and
###427 that were all NEDs.
###428 A training center opened up literally two
###430 minutes from my door.
###430 And it just kind of gave me something to
###433 channel myself into.
###434 When all my pals were at house parties, getting steaming and
###437 pumping bods and all that, I was traveling up
###439 and down the country.
###440 You hear your name getting called, then all of a sudden
###442 the roof just comes off the place.
###443 And you walk out there and you know that every single person
###446 in there's paid a tenner to come and see you do what you
###448 love doing.
###448 I don't know, it's weird.
###450 It's like you walk out in front of that crowd and I'm
###452 not just that boy that came from Paisley,
###453 I'm not just a nobody.
###454 I'm literally a superstar, if you will.
###457 I'm actually living my dream for that 10-15 minutes.
###459 But wrestling definitely gets a bad name for all the drink
###463 and drugs and all that.
###464 But from my personal point of view, it literally saved me
###468 from what would have been.
###470
