0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:3,64



2
0:0:3,64 --> 0:0:6,1
JON LONG: There's four minutes
left, Patrick.


3
0:0:6,1 --> 0:0:8,27
Patrick, me boy.


4
0:0:8,27 --> 0:0:15,0
Paddy, me boy, we have four
minutes left before it's 2007.


5
0:0:15,0 --> 0:0:16,7
You want a drink, fucker?


6
0:0:16,7 --> 0:0:17,98
PATRICK O'DELL: Yes.


7
0:0:17,98 --> 0:0:20,2
JON LONG: I got Jameson.


8
0:0:20,2 --> 0:0:24,9
PATRICK O'DELL: No, I'm OK,
I'll have some later.


9
0:0:24,9 --> 0:0:25,34
I got to film.


10
0:0:25,34 --> 0:0:30,82



11
0:0:30,82 --> 0:0:32,119
Hi, welcome back to the show.


12
0:0:32,119 --> 0:0:36,2
This episode is about a New
Year's trip we took to Mexico.


13
0:0:36,2 --> 0:0:39,94
We went to Spanky's dad's house
who has a really cool


14
0:0:39,94 --> 0:0:43,312
surf shack overlooking
the ocean.


15
0:0:43,312 --> 0:0:46,21
Oh, and also Jerry Hsu came
along on this trip.


16
0:0:46,21 --> 0:0:49,84
And you might know Jerry from
his part in the Enjoi video,


17
0:0:49,84 --> 0:0:53,6
which I think is one of the best
video parts of all time.


18
0:0:53,6 --> 0:0:55,9
And we're going to ask him
a little bit about that.


19
0:0:55,9 --> 0:0:57,28
The rest is just home movies.


20
0:0:57,28 --> 0:1:1,37
It's just a little bit of video
from our vacation in


21
0:1:1,37 --> 0:1:5,8
Mexico for New Year's Eve.


22
0:1:5,8 --> 0:1:6,9
JON LONG: We're Kilometer 55.


23
0:1:6,9 --> 0:1:8,89
I probably don't want to say
that, I probably want to say


24
0:1:8,89 --> 0:1:11,28
Kilometer 85.


25
0:1:11,28 --> 0:1:13,34
JERRY HSU: I don't
know, it's just


26
0:1:13,34 --> 0:1:16,1
gangster beachfront property.


27
0:1:16,1 --> 0:1:18,576
It's actually just a
converted trailer,


28
0:1:18,576 --> 0:1:20,61
but it's pretty awesome.


29
0:1:20,61 --> 0:1:23,132
No electricity.


30
0:1:23,132 --> 0:1:24,56
MALE SPEAKER: None of
our phones work.


31
0:1:24,56 --> 0:1:26,7
JERRY HSU: None of
our phones work.


32
0:1:26,7 --> 0:1:27,95
We make quesadillas.


33
0:1:27,95 --> 0:1:30,8



34
0:1:30,8 --> 0:1:32,2
CHRIS SHONTING: It's
fairly amazing.


35
0:1:32,2 --> 0:1:35,54
There's a surf spot in
every single-- well,


36
0:1:35,54 --> 0:1:37,745
left to right direction.


37
0:1:37,745 --> 0:1:43,27
When the tide goes out you can
prod animals in the sea in


38
0:1:43,27 --> 0:1:45,601
tide pools.


39
0:1:45,601 --> 0:1:48,224
MALE SPEAKER: He's so bummed,
there he goes.


40
0:1:48,224 --> 0:1:48,701
Ah!


41
0:1:48,701 --> 0:1:50,609
Dude, you popped it!


42
0:1:50,609 --> 0:1:52,4
It's leaking.


43
0:1:52,4 --> 0:1:53,63
CHRIS SHONTING: There was a
guy catching octopuses out


44
0:1:53,63 --> 0:1:55,583
there earlier and just kind
of smashing them.


45
0:1:55,583 --> 0:1:56,833
MALE SPEAKER: Whoa!


46
0:1:56,833 --> 0:1:58,49



47
0:1:58,49 --> 0:2:2,28
KEVIN LONG: Pulled out an
octopus, beat it with his


48
0:2:2,28 --> 0:2:5,48
metal stick, and then ripped off
one of the limbs, and then


49
0:2:5,48 --> 0:2:7,95
threw it in his bucket
and kept going.


50
0:2:7,95 --> 0:2:10,914
MALE SPEAKER: Calamari.


51
0:2:10,914 --> 0:2:12,502
MALE SPEAKER: I'm going to take
all of this footage of


52
0:2:12,502 --> 0:2:14,624
Jerry walking on the beach
and I'm going to put


53
0:2:14,624 --> 0:2:17,905
on really sad music.


54
0:2:17,905 --> 0:2:21,46
CHRIS SHONTING: Little
delicate genius.


55
0:2:21,46 --> 0:2:24,51
When he falls on a skateboard,
I start crying.


56
0:2:24,51 --> 0:2:27,85
You feel like you're going to
see someone die if he falls,


57
0:2:27,85 --> 0:2:30,93
because it's always
the worst fall.


58
0:2:30,93 --> 0:2:35,21
Yeah, he bounces back-- like,
I've see his chin explode and


59
0:2:35,21 --> 0:2:37,5
I felt it right in my nuts.


60
0:2:37,5 --> 0:2:39,52
You know, you just land and
like your feet, your


61
0:2:39,52 --> 0:2:40,943
board's just gone.


62
0:2:40,943 --> 0:2:43,298
JERRY HSU: Ah!


63
0:2:43,298 --> 0:2:44,274
God!


64
0:2:44,274 --> 0:2:46,23
Fuck!


65
0:2:46,23 --> 0:2:49,1
CHRIS SHONTING: I'm always
freaked out, but I'm amazed.


66
0:2:49,1 --> 0:2:50,35
I don't know.


67
0:2:50,35 --> 0:2:53,65



68
0:2:53,65 --> 0:2:56,29
JERRY HSU: No, I haven't skated
in like-- well, I've


69
0:2:56,29 --> 0:3:0,4
skated, but I've been taking
kind of an extended vacation


70
0:3:0,4 --> 0:3:2,83
for like a year.


71
0:3:2,83 --> 0:3:5,17
Yeah, everyone was like, you
should just take a break.


72
0:3:5,17 --> 0:3:6,95
And I was like, all right.


73
0:3:6,95 --> 0:3:8,315
Yeah, it's kind of weird.


74
0:3:8,315 --> 0:3:9,28
I actually--


75
0:3:9,28 --> 0:3:10,9
the last six months of
it was really when I


76
0:3:10,9 --> 0:3:13,27
did the most of it.


77
0:3:13,27 --> 0:3:17,11
For like a year and a half I was
just like, la de da, blah,


78
0:3:17,11 --> 0:3:17,78
blah, blah.


79
0:3:17,78 --> 0:3:20,84
But then the last six months
is always like, OK, every


80
0:3:20,84 --> 0:3:23,67
single weekend just
destroy myself.


81
0:3:23,67 --> 0:3:27,405



82
0:3:27,405 --> 0:3:29,385
[GROAN].


83
0:3:29,385 --> 0:3:32,355



84
0:3:32,355 --> 0:3:34,83
God!


85
0:3:34,83 --> 0:3:39,78
[SCREAM].


86
0:3:39,78 --> 0:3:42,27
MALE SPEAKER: Whoa!


87
0:3:42,27 --> 0:3:43,385
Ah!


88
0:3:43,385 --> 0:3:45,82
Jerry!


89
0:3:45,82 --> 0:3:48,71
JERRY HSU: All the big cheeses
and stuff, they're like, OK,


90
0:3:48,71 --> 0:3:51,1
your part's pretty cool
but we need like


91
0:3:51,1 --> 0:3:52,31
the last, last thing.


92
0:3:52,31 --> 0:3:54,18
And I was like, OK.


93
0:3:54,18 --> 0:3:59,662
So I went and I tried it
one day and I got hurt.


94
0:3:59,662 --> 0:4:2,6
[SCREAM].


95
0:4:2,6 --> 0:4:4,15
And I was like, fuck,
I'm hurt.


96
0:4:4,15 --> 0:4:8,37
And it was like the last
month I could film and


97
0:4:8,37 --> 0:4:9,37
I got hurt on that.


98
0:4:9,37 --> 0:4:11,17
And then for like one month
straight I was just


99
0:4:11,17 --> 0:4:11,93
thinking about it.


100
0:4:11,93 --> 0:4:13,82
Like, oh man, I got to
go back and do that.


101
0:4:13,82 --> 0:4:17,12
And I was super scared that I
was going to jump down it once


102
0:4:17,12 --> 0:4:20,13
and just be like, can't do it.


103
0:4:20,13 --> 0:4:23,705



104
0:4:23,705 --> 0:4:24,99
I don't know.


105
0:4:24,99 --> 0:4:29,26
Probably like 20?


106
0:4:29,26 --> 0:4:30,6
25 or something?


107
0:4:30,6 --> 0:4:31,44
But I don't know.


108
0:4:31,44 --> 0:4:32,81
I never really think about
how many tries


109
0:4:32,81 --> 0:4:34,72
it takes to do something.


110
0:4:34,72 --> 0:4:38,7
I kind of just zone out.


111
0:4:38,7 --> 0:4:39,32
Ow!


112
0:4:39,32 --> 0:4:41,974



113
0:4:41,974 --> 0:4:43,224
[SHOUTS].


114
0:4:43,224 --> 0:4:48,806



115
0:4:48,806 --> 0:4:50,758
MALE SPEAKER: Oh!


116
0:4:50,758 --> 0:4:51,246
[WHISTLE].


117
0:4:51,246 --> 0:4:52,34
Come on, Jerry, right
back at it.


118
0:4:52,34 --> 0:4:53,705
Get this thing.


119
0:4:53,705 --> 0:4:57,56
JERRY HSU: Matt, the brand
manager, he was stressing out


120
0:4:57,56 --> 0:4:58,62
because he made the video.


121
0:4:58,62 --> 0:5:1,92
And then he turned to me and he
was just like, well, just


122
0:5:1,92 --> 0:5:4,422
go do that fucking trick
down those stairs.


123
0:5:4,422 --> 0:5:8,35
And I got so mad, and I was
like, I'll show him.


124
0:5:8,35 --> 0:5:9,728
I'm going to do that trick.


125
0:5:9,728 --> 0:5:11,968
MALE SPEAKER: Do you have any
New Year's resolutions?


126
0:5:11,968 --> 0:5:14,727
JERRY HSU: No, I should probably
start skating again.


127
0:5:14,727 --> 0:5:18,623
EVERYONE: Four, three,
two, one.


128
0:5:18,623 --> 0:5:20,571
MALE SPEAKER: Happy new year!


129
0:5:20,571 --> 0:5:21,821
[CHEERING].


130
0:5:21,821 --> 0:5:23,94



131
0:5:23,94 --> 0:5:25,19
MALE SPEAKER: Happy new year!


132
0:5:25,19 --> 0:5:27,828



133
0:5:27,828 --> 0:5:30,744
FEMALE SPEAKER: Happy
new year!


134
0:5:30,744 --> 0:5:33,66
JON LONG: Paddy, me boy.


135
0:5:33,66 --> 0:5:34,146
FEMALE SPEAKER: Happy
new year, Jon!


136
0:5:34,146 --> 0:5:35,73
JON LONG: Happy new
year, fucker.


137
0:5:35,73 --> 0:5:37,545
PATRICK O'DELL: Happy
New Year's.


138
0:5:37,545 --> 0:5:44,97



139
0:5:44,97 --> 0:5:46,22
FEMALE SPEAKER: Happy
new year!


140
0:5:46,22 --> 0:5:48,435



141
0:5:48,435 --> 0:5:49,92
MALE SPEAKER: Happy new year!


142
0:5:49,92 --> 0:5:51,405
JON LONG: What's
yours, fucker?


143
0:5:51,405 --> 0:5:52,655
PATRICK O'DELL: I
don't have one.


144
0:5:52,655 --> 0:5:55,86



145
0:5:55,86 --> 0:5:57,345
FEMALE SPEAKER: Happy
new year, Johnson!


146
0:5:57,345 --> 0:6:1,68



147
0:6:1,68 --> 0:6:4,68
CHRIS SHONTING: Mr. Long, he's
one of those dudes that's


148
0:6:4,68 --> 0:6:7,28
honestly epic.


149
0:6:7,28 --> 0:6:10,43
There's no posturing
into epicness.


150
0:6:10,43 --> 0:6:15,4
Or no becoming epic over the
course of the day, by the end


151
0:6:15,4 --> 0:6:16,27
of the day being epic.


152
0:6:16,27 --> 0:6:19,96
It's kind of like, wake
up and just be epic.


153
0:6:19,96 --> 0:6:21,56
I don't know.


154
0:6:21,56 --> 0:6:22,81
I'm impressed.


155
0:6:22,81 --> 0:6:24,65



156
0:6:24,65 --> 0:6:26,2
JON LONG: I'm going to
tell you a couple


157
0:6:26,2 --> 0:6:29,16
things about Spanky.


158
0:6:29,16 --> 0:6:31,16
Here's my beef with the kid.


159
0:6:31,16 --> 0:6:34,86
I wish that he let kids
know that he was


160
0:6:34,86 --> 0:6:36,24
really good at school.


161
0:6:36,24 --> 0:6:37,22
He never graduated.


162
0:6:37,22 --> 0:6:40,24
I could give a rat's
ass about that.


163
0:6:40,24 --> 0:6:41,58
I don't care about that.


164
0:6:41,58 --> 0:6:46,26
But he was really good, he's
passionate about life.


165
0:6:46,26 --> 0:6:49,94
And his family is all passionate
about life.


166
0:6:49,94 --> 0:6:54,57
And that's what I'm trying
to say here.


167
0:6:54,57 --> 0:6:59,58
That's what he does and
that's who he is.


168
0:6:59,58 --> 0:7:8,0
And in that comes this place
and these people and you.


169
0:7:8,0 --> 0:7:11,5
And that's passionate
about life.


170
0:7:11,5 --> 0:7:13,8
OK, I'm getting philosophical
here.


171
0:7:13,8 --> 0:7:14,16
Hey.


172
0:7:14,16 --> 0:7:15,26
KEVIN LONG: Hey, fucker.


173
0:7:15,26 --> 0:7:16,2
JON LONG: This is the--


174
0:7:16,2 --> 0:7:16,61
FEMALE SPEAKER: The build up.


175
0:7:16,61 --> 0:7:24,25
JON LONG: This is my friend,
my bro, my friend.


176
0:7:24,25 --> 0:7:24,74
KEVIN LONG: Guys?


177
0:7:24,74 --> 0:7:28,4
JON LONG: I've never told you
that, but you know what?


178
0:7:28,4 --> 0:7:31,3
You're like my fucking
best friend.


179
0:7:31,3 --> 0:7:32,355
KEVIN LONG: You're
my best friend.


180
0:7:32,355 --> 0:7:34,6
I love you, dad.


181
0:7:34,6 --> 0:7:38,79
JON LONG: I love you,
son, and I mean it.


182
0:7:38,79 --> 0:7:40,41
FEMALE SPEAKER: Speech!


183
0:7:40,41 --> 0:7:43,126
PATRICK O'DELL: You guys,
I love you guys.


184
0:7:43,126 --> 0:7:47,865
And I want you to know that,
look at you and look at us.


185
0:7:47,865 --> 0:7:50,415



186
0:7:50,415 --> 0:7:51,665
You son of a bitch.


187
0:7:51,665 --> 0:7:54,8



188
0:7:54,8 --> 0:7:58,43
My resolution is no
more black ass.


189
0:7:58,43 --> 0:8:4,712
Because I feel that when I
cheated him, it's no more.


190
0:8:4,712 --> 0:8:6,62
MALE SPEAKER: Some more?


191
0:8:6,62 --> 0:8:7,66
MALE SPEAKER: A s'more?


192
0:8:7,66 --> 0:8:8,53
MALE SPEAKER: S'mores?


193
0:8:8,53 --> 0:8:9,4
Is that what he said?


194
0:8:9,4 --> 0:8:10,36
FEMALE SPEAKER: S'mores!


195
0:8:10,36 --> 0:8:14,93
JON LONG: Those are
like Patrick, do I


196
0:8:14,93 --> 0:8:16,28
have a tale for you.


197
0:8:16,28 --> 0:8:16,58
PATRICK O'DELL: What's that?


198
0:8:16,58 --> 0:8:20,78
JON LONG: You want to do it in
Spanish, English, or Irish?


199
0:8:20,78 --> 0:8:22,3
PATRICK O'DELL: English.


200
0:8:22,3 --> 0:8:23,78



201
0:8:23,78 --> 0:10:23,78
