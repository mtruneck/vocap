###8 Hi lovely people of Food Tube. Look around I am in Malta!
###13 I can't wait to start cooking today. I'm going to cook a classic Italian lamb stew. You going
###21 to enjoy it. You know what is look like? If you have ever
###25 been home for twenty years and then out of the blue you go back home and your mamma,
###30 your friend, your pappa makes this dish. It look like if you never left home.
###36 First shoulder of lamb, put them in a bowl. Salt, not too much, a bit of pepper in. Mix
###43 it all together. Extra virgin olive oil.
###47 Anchovies, yes! That is give them a little bit extra salt, make sure you melt those anchovies.
###55 Now, lamb goes in. oh yes! Seal it. It means, you make sure that the meat is all,
###66 almost roasted, almost until all around. It keeps the lovely flavour inside. Look at the
###73 lovely colour. You can see all the anchovies dissolved.
###77 Now I'm starting with a carrot. I cleaned this one I did not remove the skin. Cut it,
###86 don't do it too small. Look at the colour! Mmm. Oh. Straight in.
###94 Give them a little stir now. Now two onions should be enough to one kilo
###105 of meat which will feed well four people. I just chop them roughly. Yes.
###116 Here in Malta this is the celery they have so I use the leaves for later.
###125 And then slowly you chop it. Look all in. Such a simple dish to make. Give them a stir.
###137 This is what we call a modore. A modore is a, is a, a kind of a, a sense
###143 of a flavour. Keep stirring it, do not turn off the hear
###149 because you wont to get a lot of water out. Let the juice seal everything nicely.
###156 Now I put a couple of clove of garlic. Look what I do with the clove of garlic, I
###161 press it remove it the skin, goes straight in.
###169 Next is the chilli. Do you know if the chilli is very strong, you break it, you smell it.
###176 Oh this is strong, I will use, for four people half a chilli. Straight in. I keep stirring
###186 it. Nearly, nearly there.
###189 Now thyme, let your feeling go walking in. It's like to fall in love, you want to caress
###197 your love. And this is what it does. Look at that inside here! Yeah!
###205 Wine. You put inside about a glass of wine. Keep stirring it. And let almost all of this
###217 wine evaporate. You need to balance with a bit of vinegar. White wine vinegar.
###228 Wow! Everything dance inside there. It is a celebration. the smell which is overtaking
###235 you! I'm going to keep the smell the flavour all
###238 inside, so I need a lid. I improvised one. Aluminium foil, you can do exactly the same
###244 cover. Turn it down and let's wait in for 20minute and I will show you what's happen.
###252 Oh, my my! Taste it wise. Yes! Yup, this is the way I
###261 want it. Now potato, three potato. You cut it, easy, put it inside. Yes.
###275 Now, I need the extra little bit of salt. It's for the potato only and it will be pepper
###285 because pepper is a spice. Cherry tomatoes. It's like a little plum tomato. They're so
###292 sweet, so good. It's incredible. Straight in. Give them a quite stir.
###297 Now at this stage, you need to add to it about 250ml of stock. Mix everything together. You
###306 turn the gas down. Cover it again and cook it for about 35 minute to 40minutes.
###315 Look how tender, I can squeeze everything out. Mmmmm. So good! I can taste the flavour
###328 of everythings. Now I have here some frozen peas. If this was fresh I would have put in
###335 about 20 minutes ago. Fantastic. Look at that the colour already.
###341 Give them a quick stir. While this one is cooking. Maltese bread, yes!
###348 Ah, yup this is ready. Ahh. Let's turn this one off.
###361 Celery leaves, chop them up very fine. Lovely. A little bit of extra virgin olive oil.
###369 And this is my classic Italian lamb stew, which I've done with a shoulder but you can
###378 do with a leg. My god, it's so good! It is incredible because I'm eating the stew,
###391 bring memories back. With the family, with the friends. What a celebration. My god, it's
###399 so good! So good! I'm sorry, I am sorry this time.
