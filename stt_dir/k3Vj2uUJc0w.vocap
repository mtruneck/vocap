###0 - Your faces had sex with each other. - I had sex last night.
###3 So long as you live under my roof, you live by my rules.
###6 He kissed me! So he must like me.
###9 I've just seen Archie. He ain't coming.
###11 Just leave me alone.
###12 I knew you couldn't possibly like me!
###15 I think he's a dick for what he did.
###18 Wow!
###36 'When you've lived in someone's shadow for a long time,
###39 'you kind of get used to it.'
###40 Come on, Rae!
###42 'You have to...
###44 'especially when it's someone so perfect
###47 'and so beautiful.
###49 'You accept that some birds are high-flying birds...
###53 'and other birds are not.
###55 'But that doesn't mean they can't fly together.'
###71 Oh, he got it that time, didn't he?
###74 Being back at school on the summer holidays is just wrong, innit?
###77 Yeah, but we need to support Chlo, don't we?
###81 Come on, Chlo!
###82 - Whoo! - Come on, Chlo!
###83 You can do it!
###84 Come on, girl! Yeah!
###85 I'm telling you, it's him, it's Michael Price.
###88 He is nowhere near good-looking enough to be going out with Chloe.
###92 I mean, look at the state of her. She's well hot.
###94 Rae, you're supposed to be Chloe's best mate.
###96 How do you not know who she's sleeping with?
###99 Whoo! Come on, Chloe!
###100 Come on, Chlo!
###101 Come on, Chlo!
###102 You can do it!
###104 'All eyes on the lovely Chloe as usual.
###107 'What I wasn't telling them
###110 'was that my secret boyfriend was there as well.
###113 'Mr Carrisford,
###115 'our PE teacher/gold medal sex athlete at the Rae Olympics.
###122 'We had met every day for the last two weeks...
###127 '..in my mind.'
###129 Rae.
###131 I didn't think you'd...
###134 come.
###141 What's with all the Caramacs?
###143 Shh!
###145 You shut your pretty mouth and start opening them.
###158 'Finn had a point - why hadn't Chloe told me?
###161 'We were supposed to be best friends again.
###164 'We were supposed to tell each other everything.
###169 'The only possible explanation was that she'd made the whole thing up.
###174 'That actually, in real life,
###176 'she stayed up all night fantasising like the rest of us.'
###180 Oh, hi, Mr Carrisford.
###198 <font color="#3399CC">Subtitles by </font><font color="ffffff">MemoryOnSmells</font> <font color="#3399CC">http://UKsubtitles.ru.</font>
###237 Are you still here?
###238 'Why can't I get noticed by boys in real life,
###241 'but Chloe is even sleeping with men from my wildest fantasies?
###245 'Worst summer holiday ever.'
###250 Raemundo! This is Little Al. You know Barney and Lizard.
###254 Listen, I want to chat to you about Saturday.
###257 What's Saturday?
###258 Oasis. Knebworth.
###259 I don't want to talk about it.
###261 The lads got tickets!
###262 What?
###264 Lucky bastards!
###265 You mean... you're all actually going?
###269 We didn't know what to say.
###270 Sorry.
###272 Well, it's...
###274 not that big a deal.
###276 So... you don't want this, then?
###279 I've got one spare.
###281 Are you messing with me?
###282 I'm not messing with you.
###286 Don't mess with me.
###286 I'm not! It's real.
###290 Oh, Chop!
###307 Oh, this is the best summer holiday ever. Archie!
###312 Yes.
###313 Chop!
###314 My dear!
###315 Oh, yeah!
###320 You excited about Knebworth, then?
###322 Suppose so.
###324 'How can I have ever fantasised
###327 'about sleeping with someone so utterly annoying?
###331 'Yeah, he was stunning...
###333 'With an arse that I just wanted to bite into like a violent dog,
###338 'but he was so big-headed, so miserable, so self...'
###341 Stop staring at me. It freaks me out.
###343 I'm not staring at you.
###345 Right, whatever.
###348 So, Mr Choppy Chop...
###350 Hello.
###351 Why I am going and not Chloe or Izzy?
###354 Didn't ask them. You was first choice.
###356 Well, it's kind of a lads' trip only.
###358 But we see you as one of the lads anyway,
###360 so obviously we knew you weren't going to be a problem.
###362 Do you know what I mean? So we just carried on.
###364 'But we see you as one of the lads anyway.
###367 'But we see you as one of the lads anyway.
###369 'But we see you as one of the lads anyway...'
###372 'But we see you as one of the lads anyway...'
###387 Rae, we need to talk.
###393 You know I wanted to talk to you earlier, but...
###395 well, you've been busy with the boys all evening, so...
###401 Are you going to tell anyone, Rae?
###404 Why would I tell anyone?
###407 Don't know.
###408 Chloe, what are you thinking?!
###412 He's a teacher. It's just wrong.
###414 How can you say that?
###418 You know, the other day, you said, "I'll sex him into a coma so deep
###421 "the only way he'd wake up was if I sexed him some more."
###423 Yeah, but that doesn't mean I'd actually do anything in real life.
###426 Oh, right. OK, then.
###428 Chloe, he's clearly taking advantage of you.
###432 No! You know nothing about us.
###436 You know, cos...
###438 well, we trust each other.
###440 Yeah, right.
###441 Oh, I'm sorry, Rae, I forgot...
###443 cos you're the expert on love, aren't ya?
###445 Cos how many boys is it you've kissed again?
###448 I'd rather have only kissed one boy
###449 than give mouth-to-south resuscitation
###452 to someone twice my age
###453 in a Vauxhall Nova on a bit of scrubland behind a SPAR.
###457 Don't make me feel bad just cos I've got a boyfriend and you haven't.
###462 Do you know, you're always making me feel guilty for having things.
###467 You think I've got it so easy, Rae, and you've got no idea
###471 what it's like to have to walk into a room
###473 and have everyone look at you.
###475 All of the time.
###477 I do know what it feels like...
###480 to walk into a room and have everybody stare at me.
###485 Do you know that every time we talk to boys...
###492 they're not talking to us, they're talking to you?
###495 Whatever, Rae!
###496 Oh, no.
###499 Of course you don't, Princess Chloe.
###503 So don't you dare sit there and tell me
###506 how difficult you've got it.
###511 You're just a...
###512 I'm a what?
###517 Nothing.
###518 Go on.
###521 Say it.
###530 Chloe, you're a really shit friend.
###538 Sometimes.
###548 Well, if that's the way you feel, maybe...
###551 we shouldn't be friends.
###559 Fine.
###561 Coo-ee!
###563 Found you, sneaky sneakies!
###566 We're moving on to The Basement. Get a wriggle on.
###570 Rae's not coming.
###574 She doesn't feel well.
###585 You all right?
###602 You're gonna say that I'm angry because I'm jealous.
###606 Well, yeah, I am jealous.
###608 I'm jealous because she's pretty.
###610 I'm jealous because she's good at things.
###612 I'm jealous because she's slight but curvy. Clever. Sporty.
###615 I'm jealous because she's Grade 4 on the cello,
###618 because she volunteers at an outreach centre.
###621 I'm jealous because she's the type of girl
###623 who will one day appear on the cover of Marie Claire
###626 sunbathing on a yacht.
###628 I'm jealous just because of the way she is.
###631 Because she...
###633 well, she...
###635 she is like...
###637 a girl.
###642 Why are you friends with Chloe?
###643 Because we've always been friends. That's the reason.
###646 You have those friends, and you think,
###648 well... if I met you now... well, I wouldn't even talk to you.
###652 But because we've known each other for such a long time,
###654 because we've got a history...
###659 I've always been in her shadow and I'm just...
###661 I'm sick of it now.
###664 But why now? I mean, what's changed?
###669 All those qualities that you see in Chloe...
###671 you don't see any of those in yourself?
###673 Well, I'm definitely not girly.
###675 Why do you say that?
###677 My nickname is Raemundo.
###679 I drink pints. I swear.
###681 I'm loud. I tell jokes.
###683 What's not girly about telling jokes?
###686 Oh, because telling jokes is a boy thing.
###690 And boys don't like it when girls tell jokes,
###692 because it freaks them out to think that a girl
###694 might actually be funnier than what they are.
###697 Oh!
###699 So it's actually... about boys?
###703 Boys decide whether you are girly or not?
###710 I find you intensely irritating some days.
###715 It's what I live for.
###717 Maybe your relationship has changed, at least in part,
###721 because your relationship with men has changed.
###724 And because you're part of a group now,
###727 maybe you and Chloe are just trying to figure out, you know,
###729 how your friendship works now that things are different.
###732 Well, how do I figure that out?
###734 Well, you need to think, um...
###737 is there more to this relationship
###739 than having known each other for ages?
###741 You need to think how you'd feel if Chloe was no longer in your life.
###745 Would you miss her? I doubt it.
###748 You honestly don't think you'd miss her?
###753 Come on, Rae...
###755 we're making progress here.
###758 Engage with me. It's not that.
###759 What? Then what is it?
###763 I think I'm having a period.
###765 Tuesday, 16th August.
###767 Well done, that day!
###769 The first sign of womanhood for 18 months.
###771 I must have lost weight.
###773 My GP said that's probably why they stopped.
###777 I'm so pleased for you, Rae. What does it feel like?
###780 It feels like a tiny little bastard is punching me
###784 in the small of my back.
###787 Aw...
###789 Sandra the sanitary towel.
###791 It's finally time for her to fulfil her destiny.
###795 I'm actually a woman, Tix - this proves it.
###798 Now all I have to do is prove it to the boys at Knebworth.
###803 I need to look hot.
###805 Why don't you just buy a dress?
###807 I think, as a boy, that's what we think of as being pretty girly.
###810 Danny?!
###812 Yo.
###813 What the hell are you doing in here?!
###815 The men's was out of order.
###816 Look, it doesn't even have to be a dress -
###818 it could be like something a bit more... fashiony, you know?
###820 Something a bit like a... Danny, get out!
###822 Yeah... out! Hurry up and get out.
###824 I'm going. It's the ladies!
###831 Why didn't we think of that?
###877 Nice!
###897 The key to getting anything off my mum was timing.
###900 Ask her for anything when she's in a good mood
###903 and you're guaranteed success.
###906 Things weren't looking good.
###911 New regime?
###913 Russian Peasant diet.
###916 Only fucking liquids for the next four days.
###920 I'm eating a bowl of vegetable stock for my dinner.
###923 Mmm...
###924 Smells good.
###928 I was thinking
###930 that it might be nice
###932 if I got some new clothes. How much?
###934 Well, there's this company that do, like, tailor-made stuff...
###937 How much?
###940 95 quid.
###941 You think I was born yesterday
###943 floating down the river on a banana boat? No chance.
###948 I can't find anything that fits me in a normal shop!
###951 Why don't you borrow something of mine?
###953 Because I'd rather die.
###960 This isn't fair!
###962 Everyone else gets money off their parents!
###964 But no, I've got to live in a house that doesn't even stock tampons!
###969 Do you know what, Mum?
###971 Value sanitary towels are a crime against my femininity.
###975 Oh, well, I'm sorry, Ms Pankhurst,
###978 next time I go to the supermarket,
###980 I'll buy you a bag of swans' necks and you can use those.
###984 Besides, you only started your period again today, so, you know,
###987 let's not pretend we're experts.
###1015 All right!
###1020 Fucking typical!
###1023 Well, can I come in?
###1035 So how was The Basement the other night?
###1037 It was all right.
###1041 Look, this is some of the stuff that you left at mine.
###1047 I thought I'd bring it round for you.
###1052 Rae, there's something else I need to talk to you about.
###1056 Well, I didn't know where else to go, because...
###1060 you're the only one who knows about Stephen.
###1062 Who's the fuck's Stephen?
###1064 Mr Carrisford!
###1066 Oh...
###1068 Right.
###1070 So has he broken up with you, then?
###1073 He was just a boyfriend.
###1075 I think it's probably for the best,
###1078 because it wasn't right... you and him...
###1082 going out with each other.
###1084 Yeah, well, he hasn't broken up with me!
###1091 I'm pregnant!
###1098 Fucking hell.
###1103 Well...
###1105 say something, Rae!
###1107 Fucking hell!
###1109 I thought you were on the pill!
###1110 Yeah, well, I stopped taking it.
###1113 Why?
###1116 The packet said it could make you put on weight.
###1119 So rather than just put on a little bit of weight,
###1122 you thought that you would risk getting knocked up?!
###1125 Yeah, do you know, that's exactly what I thought!
###1128 Uh...! You know what, Chloe?
###1130 Most pregnant women, well, they put on at least...
###1134 one, two, three...
###1135 Yeah, I get the irony of it, Rae!
###1136 Rae, if you want your jeans washing inside out,
###1139 put them in the basket in... side... out!
###1145 So what are you gonna do about it, then?
###1149 Are you gonna tell Mr Car...
###1151 Stephen?
###1153 No.
###1155 It would ruin everything.
###1156 I think you should.
###1158 Yeah, well, you don't know him, Rae.
###1160 You're the one that said you trust each other.
###1162 Don't have a go at me!
###1164 I'm not having a go at you.
###1169 Do you know, my mum...
###1173 I remember she told me ages ago she got pregnant when she was young.
###1179 She said it stays with you.
###1182 Whether you have it or not.
###1184 You know, whatever decision you make, it's for ever.
###1188 She'd be so disappointed if she knew about this.
###1199 I've got an appointment at the clinic on Thursday.
###1206 Will you come with me? You don't have to.
###1209 It's fine.
###1209 Chloe...
###1212 I'll come with you.
###1215 OK.
###1223 I'll see you later.
###1228 It's bad.
###1230 OK, it's really bad,
###1232 but this was typical of Chloe! I have my first kiss,
###1236 she loses her virginity.
###1237 I get my period back,
###1239 and she gets pregnant!
###1241 If I went to Butlin's on holiday,
###1242 she'd probably go to Disneyland...
###1245 on the bloody moon.
###1247 I hate myself for thinking that.
###1252 God...
###1254 Please... please... please...
###1256 Oh, God. Oh, Jabba!
###1258 Oh, fuck!
###1259 Jabba!
###1260 'The Green Lane Gang.
###1261 'Ninja, Big G, Squeaky.
###1264 'There's only one thing you need to know about them.
###1266 'Twat, twat, twat.'
###1268 Moo-oo-oose!
###1271 Jabba!
###1273 Scrubber!
###1275 Moo-oo-oose!
###1277 Scrubber!
###1278 'Knebworth. Knebworth. Knebworth. Knebworth. Knebworth. Knebworth.'
###1283 Scrubber!
###1346 '..Very careless defending at the back.
###1349 'They now really do have a mountain to climb.'
###1355 Are you all right?
###1357 Yeah. Why?
###1359 Me and Karim barely saw you yesterday, did we?
###1362 Mmm. What's going on?
###1364 Nothing.
###1365 '..And reassess how they're going to try and plot a way
###1368 'back into this match.'
###1370 Should I ring Kester?
###1372 What? No! I'm fine.
###1385 Mum...
###1386 is there such thing as a mega period?
###1390 Mega?
###1391 Well, maybe you should go and see Dr Nick?
###1395 You can't just nip in and see Dr Nick. He's not a normal GP.
###1398 Why not? He's been your doctor for four months.
###1401 Sorting out your pills and your diet.
###1403 Why can't you talk to him about this?
###1404 Because no, all right?
###1406 Oh, I'll just get his number from the phone book.
###1408 There is no way I'm talking to Dr Nick about my mega period!
###1413 'Just another chapter of humiliation in the multi-volumed anthology
###1417 'of Rae the Ridiculous.
###1421 'Oh, God...
###1422 'he's gorgeous.
###1424 'Maybe if I hit him over the head with that paperweight,
###1427 'I could lick him all over before he regained consciousness.'
###1433 OK. Jump up on the bed so I can have a look at you.
###1437 'Oh, God.
###1438 'He'll prod my tummy,
###1441 'and the pathetic tampon holding back the bloody flood will ping out.'
###1444 Just relax.
###1445 'Oh...
###1450 'I can't...
###1452 'hold... back!'
###1455 Run! It's the mega period!
###1462 So how's everything going?
###1463 OK. Good.
###1465 You got enough meds?
###1467 Yeah.
###1471 So... I think it's just a heavy period you're having.
###1473 Painful and not nice, but nothing more sinister than that.
###1476 There is nothing to worry about.
###1477 You starting your period is just another milestone on the road to health.
###1499 I like your paperweight.
###1502 See you, Rae.
###1506 OK. We've had the results of the urine sample. And...
###1512 No, sorry.
###1513 Ah.
###1521 Ah...
###1529 You...
###1532 You are pregnant. Um...
###1534 around four weeks.
###1536 Um, I'd like an abortion.
###1538 Yeah, well, that's certainly an option you could consider.
###1541 But you don't have to decide anything today.
###1544 We provide a counselling service
###1546 where someone can talk to you on a one...
###1548 No, I don't want any of that.
###1550 I just want to get it over with.
###1552 Yeah, well, OK.
###1553 It's up to me to make sure you have every opportunity
###1555 to make the decision that's right for you, so...
###1558 Let me book you in to see one our advisors tomorrow,
###1560 and then, if you still want to go ahead, you know, hey, that's fine.
###1563 Well, what happens... if she does?
###1567 Well, if you do decide to go ahead with it,
###1570 then tomorrow you'll be given what's called
###1571 an early medical abortion pill.
###1573 Then you'll take another one on Saturday.
###1576 Following the second treatment,
###1577 you'll most likely want to be at home afterwards.
###1581 'And there's another thing Chloe's better at than me...
###1585 '..holding it together.
###1587 'She's so strong in situations where I'd crumble.
###1591 'Like when the world is crushing down on me.
###1593 'Like when I...'
###1603 You all right?
###1611 Yeah. I'm fine.
###1623 Well, thanks for coming.
###1625 It's all right.
###1628 I can come along with you tomorrow, if you want.
###1631 Nah.
###1633 I'm going to take your advice.
###1636 I'm going to tell Stephen tonight.
###1637 He'll look after me.
###1641 Well, what about Saturday for the second pill?
###1644 Everyone's going to be at Knebworth.
###1646 Rae, Stephen'll look after me.
###1648 You know... I'll be fine.
###1652 I'll just...
###1654 see you in a bit, then.
###1656 OK.
###1666 Well...
###1669 you were right.
###1672 I never thought I'd hear you say that.
###1675 I do miss her.
###1678 But... things have changed.
###1682 She's got a boyfriend now...
###1685 and you don't need your friends as much when you've got a boyfriend, do you?
###1691 At the last session,
###1692 we never finished discussing
###1694 what made you feel so angry towards Chloe.
###1697 I told you why.
###1699 I gave you my fully detailed psychological analysis.
###1703 Yeah, but I never gave you mine.
###1706 Do you want to hear it?
###1712 A couple of weeks ago, I had to pretend to be your uncle,
###1715 because you haven't told anybody out there that you've been ill.
###1720 Including Chloe.
###1723 And I think you might be angry with her
###1724 because you're starting to realise
###1728 that maybe she's no longer the type of friend
###1730 that you can talk to about things.
###1733 Oh, I couldn't give a rat's arse what Chloe's like.
###1737 I don't care about Chloe. I care about you.
###1741 And it is important to me
###1743 that you've got somebody out there you can talk to
###1745 when things get dark,
###1747 when you think about hurting yourself.
###1749 I've got my diary. I can talk to that if things get bad.
###1754 Yeah, well, you can leave things out of a diary.
###1758 You can rip out whole pages and pretend they don't exist.
###1765 This is my new home number.
###1770 Now, I want you to call it.
###1772 At any time, day or night.
###1777 Whenever you start to feel... you know.
###1785 I don't need it.
###1786 Rae!
###1789 You're taking this piece of paper. End of.
###1803 'Short skirt,
###1805 'girly top.
###1809 'This is all new to me, being a girl.
###1813 'It's difficult being quiet,
###1815 'not telling jokes or swearing,
###1818 'especially when the mega period was becoming a super mega period.
###1823 'I felt like my eyeballs were sweating.'
###1826 Right, so if we get two crates of beer
###1829 and a bottle of voddy for each car, we're rocking.
###1831 Raemundo, are you all right with beer?
###1833 Chop, you might enjoy having a ridiculous nickname,
###1836 but I don't.
###1838 It's Rae or Rachel.
###1840 What? Do you want beer or not?
###1842 Not. I'd like some Lambrini.
###1845 That's what I drink now.
###1850 Oh, Jesus...
###1852 All right, lads. Move up!
###1855 Right, who's got any tune requests for the trip?
###1859 Because I am doing the tapes for the cars.
###1861 Why are you doing them?
###1862 I know the most about music.
###1864 You know about as much about music as my mum.
###1868 All right. But under no circumstances,
###1872 feature Spaceman by Babylon Zoo.
###1874 No Babylon Zoo.
###1876 Thank you very much for sharing your in-depth knowledge of music
###1879 with us, Rae, that's brilliant.
###1881 Such a prick.
###1883 Right, I took the liberty of treating everyone.
###1888 Little Al.
###1890 Oh, yeah. Nice one, Chop!
###1891 There you are, Finn. Nice one, mate!
###1893 Raemundo.
###1898 What's up with you? You all right?
###1901 No, I've...
###1903 I've got a tummy ache.
###1904 Oh, damn.
###1905 Better be OK for tomorrow. Like the shirt?
###1910 Why don't you try it on? I dunno.
###1912 Try it on!
###1913 Maybe I don't want to try it on!
###1914 What's wrong with you?
###1916 I told everyone that you was dead cool and that you were dead funny.
###1919 You've sat here all night with a right face on.
###1921 Well, maybe I can't win! Maybe I just can't fucking win!
###1924 No matter how hard I try, I just can't get it right.
###1927 I don't even know why I bother!
###1938 Oh, crazy. Crazy. What are you doing?
###1943 Stop being stupid.
###1946 Stupid.
###1957 No...
###1958 No...
###1959 No, no, no...
###2006 Oh... my... God!
###2011 Jabba's got a jam stain!
###2013 I think I'm gonna be sick!
###2016 I genuinely think I'm gonna be sick.
###2017 Jabba's got a jam stain! That's got to be the dirtiest thing
###2020 I've ever seen. You absolute scrubber.
###2023 Scrubber! Scrubber, scrubber, scrubber!
###2025 Scrubber...
###2032 What are you doing, you?
###2033 It's all right taking the piss out of a girl, isn't it?
###2036 Well, why don't you try taking the piss out of me?
###2038 Eh? You apologise to her now
###2040 or I will fucking curl you up, all right?
###2042 All right. I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
###2045 And that goes for you two twats, as well.
###2048 Sorry.
###2054 You all right?
###2074 'Saturday, 10th August, 1996.
###2079 'The Day of Knebworth!
###2081 'Who'd have thought
###2082 'the day I get to see Liam Gallagher in the flesh,
###2086 'all my thoughts would be about another man?
###2090 'How could I have got him so wrong?
###2092 'How could I have thought that he was shallow
###2095 'when he's the most interesting,
###2098 'sweet, sensitive,
###2100 'hot-bodied Adonis in all of Lincolnshire
###2104 'and the surrounding districts?'
###2106 Rae!
###2115 I just bought, two days ago,
###2117 on your request, 20 Tampax!
###2120 20!
###2122 And now there are exactly none left.
###2124 What have you got, six vaginae or something?
###2127 I decided to change them every hour.
###2129 Every hour?!
###2131 Your hoo-ha must be the driest place in the entire universe.
###2135 I didn't want to get toxic shock!
###2137 Izzy told me about this girl who left a tampon in too long.
###2140 It went rotten, she got multiple organ failure,
###2142 then she went into a coma and she died.
###2145 Tox...?! You...!
###2151 I just, er...
###2154 I just...
###2156 I just can't...
###2162 This is my main meal for the day.
###2165 What is it?
###2167 Fucking Cup-a-Soup.
###2169 Beef flavour.
###2172 Maybe you should just go back to solids.
###2174 Oh... today's the last day.
###2179 I just need to make it till tomorrow.
###2182 It's solids tomorrow. Then it's...
###2187 I just... I need to make it till tomorrow.
###2191 I'll be all right.
###2193 I'll be all right tomorrow.
###2195 Just keep thinking about tomorrow.
###2218 Knebworth, baby girl! Let's do this!
###2221 You're in Barney's car with Finn. Come on!
###2225 Hi, Rae!
###2227 Hey.
###2231 Hiya.
###2232 All right?
###2234 How's your hand?
###2236 I'll live.
###2238 Thanks.
###2241 Anyone would have done the same thing, you know.
###2244 No, they wouldn't.
###2247 Right, everyone, this convoy is heading out!
###2251 Let's get ready! Let's do this.
###2252 Raemundo, come on!
###2255 Let's go!
###2257 What are you doing here?
###2258 I just thought I'd see everyone off.
###2261 Did you tell him?
###2263 We broke up.
###2265 What?!
###2268 Who's going with you today, then?
###2271 Don't worry about it.
###2273 Raemundo, come on, get your ass in gear! We're ready to go. Come on!
###2278 You'd better go.
###2279 Chloe, are you sure you're going to be all right?
###2281 Yeah, I'll be fine.
###2283 See you later.
###2288 Let's go!
###2291 Come on!
###2302 What?
###2303 I'm expecting marks out of ten for each tune, by the way.
###2306 Yeah, well, it's a zero for starters.
###2308 I thought this was your favourite song.
###2327 - Stop. - What?
###2329 Stop the car!
###2359 You know, he'd just split up with his ex.
###2361 They were together like... six years or something.
###2366 So he's not really in the place
###2368 to commit to something new at the moment.
###2372 Plus, he's a complete knobhead wanker.
###2380 Do you know, he had a name for his thingy.
###2383 What?
###2384 Bob.
###2386 Bob?
###2386 Yeah.
###2397 You know, I'm sorry about this week.
###2403 Just sometimes I see you with everyone,
###2406 you know? The lads. And...
###2408 you're so funny and clever. And...
###2412 I just...
###2414 I wish sometimes I'd get the chance to be seen as funny.
###2418 You are funny.
###2420 Oh, Chloe, the boys all love you.
###2425 I didn't get invited to Knebworth, though, did I?
###2429 Eh?
###2448 I went to the market
###2450 and I bought a jockstrap.
###2454 I don't know why!
###2456 Right, OK.
###2458 I went to the market
###2460 - and I bought a jockstrap... - Oh!
###2462 And a pineapple.
###2465 - I went to the market... - Miss Chloe Gemmell?
###2527 You all right?
###2530 Yeah, I think that's it now.
###2534 Aw...!
###2536 Listen to that crowd!
###2538 I can almost smell the burgers just frying
###2542 in the stalls at the side of the fields.
###2548 Oh, no!
###2548 Oh, no! Oh, no, what?
###2550 Some tall bastard's just stood in front of me.
###2552 I can't see the stage any more!
###2554 Do you know what? I fucking hate that!
###2556 You can get on my shoulders if you want!
###2558 Yeah? Yeah.
###2559 Oh. Maybe you should get on my shoulders.
###2562 Yeah.
###2567 This is nice.
###2569 Why don't we invite Izzy around?
###2570 No.
###2573 No, I...
###2575 I like it when it's just us two.
###2577 I love Izzy,
###2579 but... but I think her head would've exploded if I'd told her.
###2590 Yeah. It needed to be you.
###2596 Come here.
###2598 Aw...
###2601 You're all right, though, yeah?
###2615 Chloe...
###2616 Hmm?
###2619 I wasn't in France this year.
###2622 Where were you?
###2627 I've been ill.
###2629 What do you mean, ill?
###2633 Like, proper ill?
###2639 I did something stupid.
###2642 I hurt myself.
###2649 Why, Rae?
###2654 Why would you do that?
###2664 I've got it!
###2668 Hello.
###2671 Hiya.
###2675 Yeah, I'm fine.
###2678 Just listening to Knebworth. Why?
###2683 Yeah, all right!
###2686 All right, fine. Bye.
###2692 That was Stephen.
###2696 He wants to talk, so, um...
###2699 I'm going to go round to his house.
###2702 When?
###2704 You know, I need to go.
###2706 We'll talk about this when I get back, I promise.
###2709 Chloe, I...
###2710 Rae, I really need to know what he's got to say.
###2715 Can you stay here so my parents still think I'm in?
###2718 What?
###2720 Look, Rae, please! I'll be... I'll be as quick as I can.
###2723 OK? So just... just stay here.
###2726 I'll be half an hour... tops.
###2728 OK? Just don't move.
