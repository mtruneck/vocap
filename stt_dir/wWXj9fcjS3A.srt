0:0:1,2 --> 0:0:3,72
Anyone watching thinking
we know fuck-all


2
0:0:3,72 --> 0:0:7,28
about knowing fuck-all about owt
needs to watch their back.


3
0:0:7,28 --> 0:0:11,36
So you've had your Labour
reclassifying skunk,


4
0:0:11,36 --> 0:0:14,6
sending prices sky-high, literally,


5
0:0:14,6 --> 0:0:17,68
literally taking the grass
from its own roots!


6
0:0:17,68 --> 0:0:19,84
Now you've got your ConDemNation ...


7
0:0:19,84 --> 0:0:23,6
Liberals noshing Tories
like altar boys picking dimps up!


8
0:0:23,6 --> 0:0:27,8
Have we had a national fucking
stroke, or what?


9
0:0:27,8 --> 0:0:30,56
Is revolution a word,
or was it never?


10
0:0:30,56 --> 0:0:33,48
Anybody watching needs to know,


11
0:0:33,48 --> 0:0:36,92
we cope better than average
with irony in Chatsworth.


12
0:0:36,92 --> 0:0:39,8
Well, for fuck's sake,


13
0:0:39,8 --> 0:0:43,0
we live in Manchester,
and they charge us for water!


14
0:0:43,0 --> 0:0:47,8
I wandered lonely as a clown,
necking mushrooms rarely found.


15
0:0:47,8 --> 0:0:51,52
This green and pleasant
land in ancient times...


16
0:0:51,52 --> 0:0:54,12
yak, yak, yak, yak, yak, yak, yak,
yak, yak!


17
0:0:54,12 --> 0:1:0,719
It's not theirs any more.
This is our England now.


18
0:1:0,719 --> 0:1:3,294
Paaaarty!

Clearer with number one...
or number two?


21
0:1:11,4 --> 0:1:12,28
'Society is dead.


22
0:1:12,28 --> 0:1:16,646

23

'Don't mourn.

'Schools, hospitals, pensions,
care for the wrinklies,


25
0:1:22,16 --> 0:1:28,119
'all that "cradle to the grave"
shite was just an expensive luxury.


26
0:1:28,119 --> 0:1:30,88

0:1:30,88 --> 0:1:35,72
'We are animals.
It is survival of the fittest.

'To paraphrase the one good Scouser,

I don't believe in society.


30
0:1:41,2 --> 0:1:48,6
'I just believe in me.'


31
0:1:48,6 --> 0:1:53,0
Straight ahead.


32
0:1:53,0 --> 0:1:56,36
Noble profession, optician.


33
0:1:56,36 --> 0:1:59,84
Helping the blind to see,
windows to the soul.


34
0:1:59,84 --> 0:2:1,76
There's more money in dentistry,


35
0:2:1,76 --> 0:2:4,8
but I didn't get the grades,
so here I am,


36
0:2:4,8 --> 0:2:6,76
living the dream.
One of the girls will help you pick


37
0:2:6,76 --> 0:2:9,0
some frames
from our own-brand range.


38
0:2:9,0 --> 0:2:10,4
Beg pardon?


39
0:2:10,4 --> 0:2:11,8
Your prescription.


40
0:2:11,8 --> 0:2:13,52
Oh, no, you don't understand,
doctor.


41
0:2:13,52 --> 0:2:15,32
The dole sent me down here.


42
0:2:15,32 --> 0:2:17,794
You have to go through the motions,
or they dock your benefit.


43
0:2:17,794 --> 0:2:21,981
I'm not a doctor,
and you need glasses.


44
0:2:21,981 --> 0:2:26,2
That's... not... possible.


45
0:2:26,2 --> 0:2:27,593
It's fact.


46
0:2:27,593 --> 0:2:33,0
I'm not of the four-eyed persuasion.
I'm strong. Me against...


47
0:2:33,0 --> 0:2:35,8
I've got the constitution of an ox.


48
0:2:35,8 --> 0:2:37,36
An ox that needs glasses.


49
0:2:37,36 --> 0:2:40,2
There's fuck-all wrong with my eyes,
so get serious.


50
0:2:40,2 --> 0:2:43,266
Put your breasts away and look again
with your little torch,


51
0:2:43,266 --> 0:3:25,76
and see if we can't get it
right this time.


52
0:3:25,76 --> 0:3:28,72
(CLEARS THROAT)


53
0:3:28,72 --> 0:3:33,12
LAUGHTER


54
0:3:33,12 --> 0:3:35,64
Ha, ha, ha.


55
0:3:35,64 --> 0:3:37,56
Very fucking funny.


56
0:3:37,56 --> 0:3:41,48
How can a piss-stained tramp like
you be too vain to wear glasses?


57
0:3:41,48 --> 0:3:42,68
It's not vanity.


58
0:3:42,68 --> 0:3:43,8
Yeah, and a wash wouldn't go amiss!


59
0:3:43,8 --> 0:3:49,4
Fuck off, you chimp!


60
0:3:49,4 --> 0:3:51,44
All right, knock it on the head.


61
0:3:51,44 --> 0:3:53,36
Come on, we're only having a joke.


62
0:3:53,36 --> 0:3:54,6
Fuck off!


63
0:3:54,6 --> 0:4:1,76
Ooh, have we hurt your feelings?


64
0:4:1,76 --> 0:4:4,0
How was the graduation?


65
0:4:4,0 --> 0:4:7,584
Brilliant ceremony.
All dresses and gowns


66
0:4:7,584 --> 0:4:9,935
and hats like the Royal Wedding,


67
0:4:9,935 --> 0:4:17,12
but without the inbreeding.


68
0:4:17,12 --> 0:4:20,16
Magical, pregnancy. It's brilliant.


69
0:4:20,16 --> 0:4:21,84
Oh, it's a hoot.


70
0:4:21,84 --> 0:4:24,76
Do you mind if I have a little rub?


71
0:4:24,76 --> 0:4:31,365
Fire in, everyone else does.


72
0:4:31,365 --> 0:4:36,8
Good to have a graduate in the family.
White collar worker, respectable.


73
0:4:36,8 --> 0:4:38,68
Is that what it's about,
respectability?


74
0:4:38,68 --> 0:4:40,84
You're asking the wrong person.


75
0:4:40,84 --> 0:4:47,24
You dirty bastard!


76
0:4:47,24 --> 0:4:51,68
I hope he appreciates
all this effort.


77
0:4:51,68 --> 0:4:55,92
Buzzin'. Best day of my life.


78
0:4:55,92 --> 0:4:57,4
Got to go.


79
0:4:57,4 --> 0:4:58,88
Come on, stay for another drink.


80
0:4:58,88 --> 0:5:0,68
Yeah, don't go!


81
0:5:0,68 --> 0:5:2,2
His mates are throwing a party
for him.


82
0:5:2,2 --> 0:5:4,36
Yeah, my mates.


83
0:5:4,36 --> 0:5:21,499
â™ª THEME FROM 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY


84
0:5:21,499 --> 0:5:23,96
I graduated.
I'm a qualified teacher.


85
0:5:23,96 --> 0:5:25,976
Mammoth.


86
0:5:25,976 --> 0:5:30,6
Mates? Fuck it,
they can wait an hour.


87
0:5:30,6 --> 0:5:32,76
CHEERING


88
0:5:32,76 --> 0:5:34,88
Cheers, everyone!


89
0:5:34,88 --> 0:5:45,6
Here's to the class of 2012.


90
0:5:45,6 --> 0:5:47,28
You all right, love?


91
0:5:47,28 --> 0:5:50,52
Yeah. Must have got caught up
with his classmates.


92
0:5:50,52 --> 0:5:53,88
Did you tell him
you were planning a do?


93
0:5:53,88 --> 0:5:58,56
Thought he'd pick up on my hints.
Clearly not.


94
0:5:58,56 --> 0:6:1,56
His phone goes straight
to voicemail.


95
0:6:1,56 --> 0:6:3,6
Poor cow's in denial.


96
0:6:3,6 --> 0:6:4,8
What of?


97
0:6:4,8 --> 0:6:11,28
That her man's an arsehole.
Thank fuck we're normal, son, eh?


98
0:6:11,28 --> 0:6:12,359
For fuck's sake,


99
0:6:12,359 --> 0:6:24,44
look in the mirror before you
come out the toilet, will you?


100
0:6:24,44 --> 0:6:26,8
Sorry.


101
0:6:26,8 --> 0:6:37,96
Sorry.


102
0:6:37,96 --> 0:6:43,531
How about some porky pig?


103
0:6:43,531 --> 0:6:46,675
Oh, vanity, thy name is salmonella.


104
0:6:46,675 --> 0:6:51,773
Jesus Christ! What the fuck,
Nosferatu?


105
0:6:51,773 --> 0:6:53,76
If you're trawling the night
for the blood of virgins,


106
0:6:53,76 --> 0:6:55,52
you'll have a long wait round here.


107
0:6:55,52 --> 0:6:58,44
I have the sweats, and you're lucky
I do. If you could read,


108
0:6:58,44 --> 0:7:0,674
you'd see that meat's not
fit for human consumption.


109
0:7:0,674 --> 0:7:3,171
I was saving it for theducks.


110
0:7:3,171 --> 0:7:4,8
Ducks can't eat bacon.


111
0:7:4,8 --> 0:7:7,32
Tell me something I don't know.


112
0:7:7,32 --> 0:7:9,56
And aren't you a bit
past your own sell-by


113
0:7:9,56 --> 0:7:12,28
to be self-conscious
about wearing glasses?


114
0:7:12,28 --> 0:7:14,56
I am not self-conscious.


115
0:7:14,56 --> 0:7:19,36
Bollocks. You're like a teenager
who's been told not to pop his zits.


116
0:7:19,36 --> 0:7:20,88
We do have mirrors.


117
0:7:20,88 --> 0:7:24,88
I am aware that energy expended on
vanity's largely wasted on my part,


118
0:7:24,88 --> 0:7:27,16
kind though it is of you
to point it out.


119
0:7:27,16 --> 0:7:32,12
So, what?


120
0:7:32,12 --> 0:7:34,56
I cannot be weak.


121
0:7:34,56 --> 0:7:37,48
I know what they think round here.


122
0:7:37,48 --> 0:7:40,4
You've seen how they treat me.
Laugh, point, kick, rob.


123
0:7:40,4 --> 0:7:44,8
Not many tears shed when
I fell in the Jockey, was there?


124
0:7:44,8 --> 0:7:45,8
Sticks and stones.


125
0:7:45,8 --> 0:7:52,76
It's only because I have this, yeah?
This.


126
0:7:52,76 --> 0:7:58,626
Faculties. Senses, head, body.


127
0:7:58,626 --> 0:8:1,2
If I'm strong,
they can do whatever they like,


128
0:8:1,2 --> 0:8:2,88
but they cannot penetrate.


129
0:8:2,88 --> 0:8:4,72
I am immune.


130
0:8:4,72 --> 0:8:9,88
And wearing glasses
fractures your superhero defences?


131
0:8:9,88 --> 0:8:15,759
Spectacles, hearing aids, walking
sticks, prosthetic limbs. These...


132
0:8:15,759 --> 0:8:18,786
these...


133
0:8:18,786 --> 0:8:23,149
place me on a very slippery slope.


134
0:8:23,149 --> 0:8:25,4
If I am weak...


135
0:8:25,4 --> 0:8:30,32
I will not survive.


136
0:8:30,32 --> 0:8:53,16
Yeah, we open at seven. Doesn't mean
I want to be out of my pit at seven.


137
0:8:53,16 --> 0:8:54,72
What time do you have, Feeney?


138
0:8:54,72 --> 0:8:56,55
Just gone half past the hour, Miss.


139
0:8:56,55 --> 0:9:4,16
Begin.


140
0:9:4,16 --> 0:9:18,0
Right, lads, not much time. You know
the drill. You, number 10. You, 11.


141
0:9:18,0 --> 0:9:20,44
Remember, be firm.
Get straight to the point.


142
0:9:20,44 --> 0:9:24,28
Leave them in no doubt.
They'll be glad of it.


143
0:9:24,28 --> 0:9:27,56
God in heaven, you'll have
the thing off its hinges!


144
0:9:27,56 --> 0:9:30,72
Don't open the door at this time
of the morning, it can only be...


145
0:9:30,72 --> 0:9:33,32
Operation New Start.


146
0:9:33,32 --> 0:9:36,8
DSS Gestapo.


147
0:9:36,8 --> 0:9:38,56
These are court-signed documents
ordering you


148
0:9:38,56 --> 0:9:41,12
to vacate these premises
with immediate effect.


149
0:9:41,12 --> 0:9:47,32
You're being evicted.


150
0:9:47,32 --> 0:9:50,4
All right, all right!
Keep your hair on...


151
0:9:50,4 --> 0:9:54,52
so I can scalp you
when I open the fucking door.


152
0:9:54,52 --> 0:9:55,76
Can we come in?


153
0:9:55,76 --> 0:9:56,96
No. It's not even nine yet.
What's going on?


154
0:9:56,96 --> 0:9:58,24
We've been evicted.


155
0:9:58,24 --> 0:9:59,16
Who has?


156
0:9:59,16 --> 0:10:11,24
All of us.


157
0:10:11,24 --> 0:10:13,4
Now, they can't search the house.


158
0:10:13,4 --> 0:10:15,4
We've still got
some human rights left


159
0:10:15,4 --> 0:10:17,48
in this fucking dictatorship
of the moderate.


160
0:10:17,48 --> 0:10:19,68
So we don't need to
flush the drugs, then?


161
0:10:19,68 --> 0:10:22,68
No, we're safe... what drugs?


162
0:10:22,68 --> 0:10:24,64
You stupid...


163
0:10:24,64 --> 0:10:28,16
If the place wasn't swarming with
suits, I'd strip-search you,


164
0:10:28,16 --> 0:10:29,28
you little bastard.


165
0:10:29,28 --> 0:10:30,6
What are you doing?


166
0:10:30,6 --> 0:10:35,68
Make noise, move about.
Be several children.


167
0:10:35,68 --> 0:10:38,24
Keep the noise down, will you?


168
0:10:38,24 --> 0:10:40,52
We've got guests. Bloody 'ell, kids.


169
0:10:40,52 --> 0:10:41,64
Mayhem up there.


170
0:10:41,64 --> 0:10:45,12
Oh, hello.


171
0:10:45,12 --> 0:10:49,36
He still doesn't get it, Miss.


172
0:10:49,36 --> 0:10:51,84
Stop calling me "Miss".


173
0:10:51,84 --> 0:10:54,72
It's creepy, like I invented you
in a fucking lab.


174
0:10:54,72 --> 0:10:56,4
Sorry, Mi...


175
0:10:56,4 --> 0:10:58,92
So... Aidan Croker,


176
0:10:58,92 --> 0:11:2,36
14, should be upstairs.


177
0:11:2,36 --> 0:11:4,56
And this little angel
should be Stella.


178
0:11:4,56 --> 0:11:8,24
Are you enjoying your...
your breakfast?


179
0:11:8,24 --> 0:11:11,8
Prawn Cocktail. Loves her seafood,
so she does.


180
0:11:11,8 --> 0:11:15,4
Right, so no other children,
is that correct?


181
0:11:15,4 --> 0:11:17,88
Or are you suggesting
there are some more up there?


182
0:11:17,88 --> 0:11:20,16
THUDDING UPSTAIRS


183
0:11:20,16 --> 0:11:23,44
Yeah, just the one.
But he puts himself about a bit.


184
0:11:23,44 --> 0:11:27,92
This is a multi-agency operation,
Mr Gallagher.


185
0:11:27,92 --> 0:11:31,64
Department of Work and Pensions,
local council,


186
0:11:31,64 --> 0:11:38,4
HMRC, environmental health,
the police.


187
0:11:38,4 --> 0:11:39,12
That's not fair!


188
0:11:39,12 --> 0:11:42,4
In the past, people have relied
on the left hand not knowing


189
0:11:42,4 --> 0:11:44,8
what the right hand is doing.
Not any more.


190
0:11:44,8 --> 0:11:47,92
You can't put people out
on the street. A child, a cripple.


191
0:11:47,92 --> 0:11:50,4
A geriatric fucking cripple.


192
0:11:50,4 --> 0:11:52,68
No, it's a broad remit.
Premises inspection,


193
0:11:52,68 --> 0:11:56,6
checking that claimants are getting
all they're entitled to...


194
0:11:56,6 --> 0:11:58,28
Or not.


195
0:11:58,28 --> 0:12:1,12
And in some very extreme cases,
I am sorry to say,


196
0:12:1,12 --> 0:12:4,76
the serving of eviction papers
to those individuals who have


197
0:12:4,76 --> 0:12:7,48
repeatedly ignored
the wishes of the court.


198
0:12:7,48 --> 0:12:8,8
What court?


199
0:12:8,8 --> 0:12:11,4
"Gallagher, Vernon Francis,


200
0:12:11,4 --> 0:12:13,72
"has failed to answer
a variety of charges


201
0:12:13,72 --> 0:12:17,44
"relating to benefit and council tax
fraud, amongst other things."


202
0:12:17,44 --> 0:12:28,48
Well, nobody told me.


203
0:12:28,48 --> 0:12:31,8
We have to look at this
as an opportunity.


204
0:12:31,8 --> 0:12:35,64
It frees you from that cycle
of debt and dependency,


205
0:12:35,64 --> 0:12:49,4
free to pursue a new start.


206
0:12:49,4 --> 0:12:54,48
Temporary accommodation for you and
the boy. Make sure and call ahead.


207
0:12:54,48 --> 0:12:55,8
St Helens?!


208
0:12:55,8 --> 0:12:58,8
Do you get that sense of freedom...


209
0:12:58,8 --> 0:13:9,28
being evicted so you can go forth
and fulfil your potential?


210
0:13:9,28 --> 0:13:13,32
See it as an opportunity to give up
the fags for good. Change your life!


211
0:13:13,32 --> 0:13:17,0
Fuck off, you bastard.
Look what you've done to me


212
0:13:17,0 --> 0:13:19,4
I'll never fit any of my clothes
again.


213
0:13:19,4 --> 0:13:21,32
In the delivery room, I want you
there,


214
0:13:21,32 --> 0:13:24,68
with an extra-strength filter tipped
and a Zippo, ready to go.


215
0:13:24,68 --> 0:13:28,6
I don't care whether they've
snipped the umbilical or not!


216
0:13:28,6 --> 0:13:29,8
Grub up.


217
0:13:29,8 --> 0:13:40,88
All nice and healthy for the baby.


218
0:13:40,88 --> 0:13:43,6
Cosy!


219
0:13:43,6 --> 0:13:45,44
How's the flat hunt going, Micky?


220
0:13:45,44 --> 0:13:48,56
Oh, I've not started yet, y'know,
been a bit busy.


221
0:13:48,56 --> 0:13:50,8
Life just takes over, doesn't?


222
0:13:50,8 --> 0:13:53,16
You know what they say,
two's company.


223
0:13:53,16 --> 0:13:55,12
Four's a party.


224
0:13:55,12 --> 0:13:57,8
I can't believe I'm going to be
called "Uncle Micky" again.


225
0:13:57,8 --> 0:13:59,44
Not... by blood.


226
0:13:59,44 --> 0:14:4,92
No, but we're roomies, so she can
call me that if she wants.


227
0:14:4,92 --> 0:14:8,24
I just called her "She"!


228
0:14:8,24 --> 0:14:9,6
Just gonna have a dump,


229
0:14:9,6 --> 0:14:13,28
kick me
mates out the spare room.


230
0:14:13,28 --> 0:14:16,92
We have got to get him
out of this fucking house.


231
0:14:16,92 --> 0:14:19,64
He won't take the hint.


232
0:14:19,64 --> 0:14:27,72
Maybe we could move.


233
0:14:27,72 --> 0:14:31,2
I better get going.


234
0:14:31,2 --> 0:14:34,76
What you flogging today?


235
0:14:34,76 --> 0:14:37,92
DVDs, bit of weed, fags,


236
0:14:37,92 --> 0:14:43,4
homebrew, viagra, toastie makers...


237
0:14:43,4 --> 0:14:47,32
they can't get
enough of the fucking toastie makers.


238
0:14:47,32 --> 0:14:59,68
OMG, come and have a look at
this Kel it's absolutely enormous!


239
0:14:59,68 --> 0:15:1,64
What time is it?


240
0:15:1,64 --> 0:15:4,0
Something's up,


241
0:15:4,0 --> 0:15:6,76
people running about all
over the place.


242
0:15:6,76 --> 0:15:8,2
When did I get in?


243
0:15:8,2 --> 0:15:9,6
About four.


244
0:15:9,6 --> 0:15:11,6
I got caught up, I'm sorry.


245
0:15:11,6 --> 0:15:14,2
Tomorrow's chip paper.


246
0:15:14,2 --> 0:15:18,44
I'm off, you better think about how
you're going to make this up to me.


247
0:15:18,44 --> 0:15:30,2
You're totally up shit creek.


248
0:15:30,2 --> 0:15:33,48
Enough!


249
0:15:33,48 --> 0:15:38,4
You're like a herd
of geese, squawk, squawk, squawk!


250
0:15:38,4 --> 0:15:40,8
Gaggle.


251
0:15:40,8 --> 0:15:41,84
What?


252
0:15:41,84 --> 0:15:48,24
S'not a "herd of geese",
it's a "gaggle of geese".


253
0:15:48,24 --> 0:15:51,72
You wouldn't say "a flock of dogs",
would you?


254
0:15:51,72 --> 0:15:54,76
Half six this morning
bailiffs turned up.


255
0:15:54,76 --> 0:15:56,88
DWP, who's that,
what's it stand for?


256
0:15:56,88 --> 0:15:59,84
LOUD CHATTING


257
0:15:59,84 --> 0:16:3,8
Any idea what they're going
on about?


258
0:16:3,8 --> 0:16:5,32
Don't know, don't care.


259
0:16:5,32 --> 0:16:8,8
Can't hang around here,
tell you that for no charge.


260
0:16:8,8 --> 0:16:13,48
Where else are they supposed to go?


261
0:16:13,48 --> 0:16:33,8
Fine, I'll go
and see what's going on.


262
0:16:33,8 --> 0:16:37,0
I presume there's a story here.


263
0:16:37,0 --> 0:16:39,12
Good night, was it?


264
0:16:39,12 --> 0:16:41,4
Yeah.


265
0:16:41,4 --> 0:16:45,68
Your missus put on a decent spread,
it's a pity you missed it.


266
0:16:45,68 --> 0:16:49,56
She's a good woman, don't fuck it
up, I speak from experience.


267
0:16:49,56 --> 0:16:52,8
I'll make it up to her.
What's going on?


268
0:16:52,8 --> 0:16:53,96
Uh, arresting folk for false
claims.


269
0:16:53,96 --> 0:16:56,4
Half the estate'll be in jail.


270
0:16:56,4 --> 0:16:57,72
I think that's the plan.


271
0:16:57,72 --> 0:17:0,8
Well, you know,
if you can't do the time, eh?


272
0:17:0,8 --> 0:17:1,72
POLICE SIRENS


273
0:17:1,72 --> 0:17:8,16
Dick.


274
0:17:8,16 --> 0:17:10,92
What's the story, Ches?


275
0:17:10,92 --> 0:17:23,56
Don't know, stormtroopers,
occupied territory.


276
0:17:23,56 --> 0:17:24,92
Step back, please.


277
0:17:24,92 --> 0:17:27,84
I'm a local business owner...
got a couple of questions.


278
0:17:27,84 --> 0:17:33,28
Let her through.


279
0:17:33,28 --> 0:17:35,32
Can I ask what's going on?


280
0:17:35,32 --> 0:17:36,24
You are...?


281
0:17:36,24 --> 0:17:40,0
Karen Maguire I run a pub
just up the road.


282
0:17:40,0 --> 0:17:40,92
You are?


283
0:17:40,92 --> 0:17:43,84
Oh, I'm so sorry, Carmen Kenaway,
Care Kenaway Solutions.


284
0:17:43,84 --> 0:17:46,52
I'm on secondment with
Operation New Start.


285
0:17:46,52 --> 0:17:48,48
You're evicting people?


286
0:17:48,48 --> 0:17:50,64
We provide support to those
who most need it.


287
0:17:50,64 --> 0:17:52,92
So... you're not evicting people?


288
0:17:52,92 --> 0:17:56,84
Those defrauding government agencies
have all assistance suspended.


289
0:17:56,84 --> 0:18:0,4
Including housing?


290
0:18:0,4 --> 0:18:0,64
Karen leave it.


291
0:18:0,64 --> 0:18:1,72
What?


292
0:18:1,72 --> 0:18:5,32
We've got licenses to protect.


293
0:18:5,32 --> 0:18:9,48
Don't open the door, Benny.
Don't open the door!


294
0:18:9,48 --> 0:18:17,64
If you don't let them in,
they can't force entry...


295
0:18:17,64 --> 0:18:21,48
Two streets so far, seven families.


296
0:18:21,48 --> 0:18:23,12
It's got fuck all to do with us,


297
0:18:23,12 --> 0:18:25,32
the last thing
we need is to draw attention.


298
0:18:25,32 --> 0:18:26,6
They can't just evict people.


299
0:18:26,6 --> 0:18:28,84
Pint, please.


300
0:18:28,84 --> 0:18:30,84
Splitting families up, temporary
accommodation,


301
0:18:30,84 --> 0:18:32,44
hostels, shelters all over the North
West.


302
0:18:32,44 --> 0:18:35,0
Wigan, St. Helens, Liverpool...


303
0:18:35,0 --> 0:18:37,4
That's worse than being homeless.


304
0:18:37,4 --> 0:18:39,72
Any chance of some fucking service,
down here?


305
0:18:39,72 --> 0:18:42,32
These families are in proper
trouble.


306
0:18:42,32 --> 0:18:44,16
Everybody's got a sob story,


307
0:18:44,16 --> 0:18:46,64
so forgive me if I can't get worked
up about it.


308
0:18:46,64 --> 0:18:48,2
I've got problems of my own,


309
0:18:48,2 --> 0:18:49,56
like where I'm going to house my
dependents.


310
0:18:49,56 --> 0:18:52,32
Don't be stupid, we've put
Patty in our spare room.


311
0:18:52,32 --> 0:18:53,32
I've got Aidan at ours.


312
0:18:53,32 --> 0:19:1,32
And we've got Stella.


313
0:19:1,32 --> 0:19:3,32
Well, don't all rush at once.


314
0:19:3,32 --> 0:19:4,8
Maybe if you weren't such a...


315
0:19:4,8 --> 0:19:5,72
I scrub up!


316
0:19:5,72 --> 0:19:7,84
A cunt, I think
she was going to say.


317
0:19:7,84 --> 0:19:9,32
You can't wash that off.


318
0:19:9,32 --> 0:19:18,4
Well, fuck the lot of you.


319
0:19:18,4 --> 0:19:20,32
Hello, officer.


320
0:19:20,32 --> 0:19:23,52
I heard you were coming back.
Well, good luck.


321
0:19:23,52 --> 0:19:25,8
They're not gonna make it easy.


322
0:19:25,8 --> 0:19:27,8
So, what's happened?


323
0:19:27,8 --> 0:19:32,588
No one told you?
You've been evicted Carl.


324
0:19:32,588 --> 0:19:34,908
Patty's bunking at ours,


325
0:19:34,908 --> 0:19:37,24
Aidan and Stella are staying
at the Maguire's, so everyone's safe.


326
0:19:37,24 --> 0:19:39,8
And dad?


327
0:19:39,8 --> 0:19:41,72
I'm sure we can make space for you.


328
0:19:41,72 --> 0:19:43,16
I'm OK, thanks.


329
0:19:43,16 --> 0:19:44,44
I'll sort something.


330
0:19:44,44 --> 0:20:9,72
We'll have few drinks later,
celebrate you being back?


331
0:20:9,72 --> 0:20:14,28
Oh, the prodigal Pig returns.


332
0:20:14,28 --> 0:20:15,32
You let us get evicted?


333
0:20:15,32 --> 0:20:18,56
Move along you're not fit company.


334
0:20:18,56 --> 0:20:20,4
Oh, so, this is the plan?


335
0:20:20,4 --> 0:20:26,8
Live rough,
sup the breakfast of champions?


336
0:20:26,8 --> 0:20:27,8
How could you do this to me?


337
0:20:27,8 --> 0:20:28,84
To you?!


338
0:20:28,84 --> 0:20:33,72
Yes, to me, remember,
the one who brought you up.


339
0:20:33,72 --> 0:20:37,6
Fucking shame of it what have
I done to deserve this?


340
0:20:37,6 --> 0:20:38,8
It's a good job.


341
0:20:38,8 --> 0:20:40,92
You're a police officer.


342
0:20:40,92 --> 0:20:42,4
Fucking hell!


343
0:20:42,4 --> 0:20:45,8
Yeah, fucking hell, yeah!
One of them.


344
0:20:45,8 --> 0:20:47,8
Yeah, I am.


345
0:20:47,8 --> 0:20:52,12
Job, pension, purpose.


346
0:20:52,12 --> 0:20:57,24
You're no son of mine.


347
0:20:57,24 --> 0:21:5,52
Oh, I'm devastated.


348
0:21:5,52 --> 0:21:7,28
Has he joined the coppers?


349
0:21:7,28 --> 0:21:17,44
Ah, I don't know.


350
0:21:17,44 --> 0:21:20,0
Hello, hello, hello.


351
0:21:20,0 --> 0:21:23,4
Y'all right?
Thought I might get a bite to eat.


352
0:21:23,4 --> 0:21:25,36
Where've you been haven't
seen you in ages?


353
0:21:25,36 --> 0:21:27,72
Doing my training.


354
0:21:27,72 --> 0:21:30,16
You know that I've joined the...?


355
0:21:30,16 --> 0:21:31,32
You bastard.


356
0:21:31,32 --> 0:21:32,96
Welcome back, mate.


357
0:21:32,96 --> 0:21:35,76
Besides not like they brainwashed
you is it?


358
0:21:35,76 --> 0:21:37,4
You're still one of us.


359
0:21:37,4 --> 0:21:39,4
Yeah, course.


360
0:21:39,4 --> 0:21:41,32
Look at you, all grown up!


361
0:21:41,32 --> 0:21:45,4
Where's the handcuffs
and the truncheon?


362
0:21:45,4 --> 0:21:48,4
Don't graduate till next week,
get all the gear then.


363
0:21:48,4 --> 0:21:51,28
I'm hoping
they'll let me bring a taser home.


364
0:21:51,28 --> 0:21:54,72
Where are you crashing?


365
0:21:54,72 --> 0:21:57,24
Don't know yet... just saw my Dad...


366
0:21:57,24 --> 0:22:0,432
Stay with us
the more the merrier at the minute.


367
0:22:0,432 --> 0:22:1,456
You sure?


368
0:22:1,456 --> 0:22:2,496
Yeah, course.


369
0:22:2,496 --> 0:22:4,484
C'mon, grab a box while you're at it.


370
0:22:4,484 --> 0:22:28,12
Don't worry about that, mate,
on you go.


371
0:22:28,12 --> 0:22:30,12
Jesus Christ!


372
0:22:30,12 --> 0:22:32,84
How long FERRET have you been
stood there for?


373
0:22:32,84 --> 0:22:35,84
Long enough to know you're
a fucking weirdo.


374
0:22:35,84 --> 0:22:38,12
Pot, kettle CUNT black.


375
0:22:38,12 --> 0:22:41,4
I don't like you being here
you should go.


376
0:22:41,4 --> 0:22:42,48
I've got a message.


377
0:22:42,48 --> 0:22:43,36
Like Jesus?


378
0:22:43,36 --> 0:22:44,16
What?


379
0:22:44,16 --> 0:22:45,76
Derren Brown? Magdalene?


380
0:22:45,76 --> 0:22:52,92
No, fuckwit, for you.


381
0:22:52,92 --> 0:22:55,16
And my ex.


382
0:22:55,16 --> 0:22:57,2
Should I write it down?


383
0:22:57,2 --> 0:23:2,44
You've got a babby coming,
and I know how much she wants that.


384
0:23:2,44 --> 0:23:9,44
And, it's not the babby's fault
she's the spawn of a mental midget.


385
0:23:9,44 --> 0:23:10,606
You said 'she'.


386
0:23:10,606 --> 0:23:13,28
Yes I did, didn't I?


387
0:23:13,28 --> 0:23:17,24
For what it's worth,
I don't wish you harm.


388
0:23:17,24 --> 0:23:23,72
There'll be no trouble from me.


389
0:23:23,72 --> 0:23:26,76
You're losing the circulation
to your hand.


390
0:23:26,76 --> 0:23:38,32
Thank you. JAFFA!


391
0:23:38,32 --> 0:23:42,4
Choccy's too big!
You might have to open the door.


392
0:23:42,4 --> 0:23:43,72
Can you do that?


393
0:23:43,72 --> 0:23:52,88
Oh! Wait a minute
I might have found another one.


394
0:23:52,88 --> 0:23:56,2
There's more than one way to skin a
cat, Feeney,


395
0:23:56,2 --> 0:24:3,72
little bit of initiative.


396
0:24:3,72 --> 0:24:6,56
Hey, you're doing a good job.


397
0:24:6,56 --> 0:24:8,76
Time someone took this
place to task.


398
0:24:8,76 --> 0:24:10,266
And, er, what's your name?


399
0:24:10,266 --> 0:24:14,66
Jackson Powell.
Jackson Powell...


400
0:24:14,66 --> 0:24:17,644
What is it, Miss, what is it?


401
0:24:17,644 --> 0:24:19,92
Oh, you dirty bastard!


402
0:24:19,92 --> 0:24:21,32
Get up, get up!


403
0:24:21,32 --> 0:24:23,88
Isn't that the person
we saw this morning?


404
0:24:23,88 --> 0:24:26,72
I think it is, Miss, yes. Get Up!


405
0:24:26,72 --> 0:24:28,605
Feeney, Feeney, wait.


406
0:24:28,605 --> 0:24:38,12
This is an opportunity.


407
0:24:38,12 --> 0:24:41,48
I mean, look at 'im.
How long's old Malky lived 'ere?


408
0:24:41,48 --> 0:24:42,64
Don't remember a time when he didn't.


409
0:24:42,64 --> 0:24:46,96
And have you ever seen him
put his hand in his pocket?


410
0:24:46,96 --> 0:24:49,68
Not once, the tight-fisted fucker!


411
0:24:49,68 --> 0:24:52,36
He's been nursing that
for four hours. RIGHT!


412
0:24:52,36 --> 0:24:55,44
Time to get a shift on! Hooverville
won't build itself, y'know?


413
0:24:55,44 --> 0:24:56,16
What you doing?


414
0:24:56,16 --> 0:24:58,24
They're getting a bit cosy.


415
0:24:58,24 --> 0:24:59,96
I told them they could crash 'ere!


416
0:24:59,96 --> 0:25:2,12
Well, that can't be legal.
So un-tell them.


417
0:25:2,12 --> 0:25:6,4
Tweet me, and complain.


418
0:25:6,4 --> 0:25:7,4
Like me Uncle Terry, that.


419
0:25:7,4 --> 0:25:10,76
This one time, he beat the
living shit out of my Aunty Sheila.


420
0:25:10,76 --> 0:25:11,76
Did she deserve it?


421
0:25:11,76 --> 0:25:12,8
What?


422
0:25:12,8 --> 0:25:15,24
Did she deserve the beating?


423
0:25:15,24 --> 0:25:19,16
I don't know, I was only little.
Anyway that's not the story... Argh!


424
0:25:19,16 --> 0:25:21,52
She didn't deserve it,
because hitting a woman


425
0:25:21,52 --> 0:25:24,28
isneveracceptable, understand?


426
0:25:24,28 --> 0:25:28,0
This is an important lesson for you,
since you've married our Mam.


427
0:25:28,0 --> 0:25:30,64
I understand! I do!


428
0:25:30,64 --> 0:25:33,4
Give it a proper wash!


429
0:25:33,4 --> 0:25:34,48
Hey!


430
0:25:34,48 --> 0:25:37,4
Got a few kegs I need to shift
up from the cellar.


431
0:25:37,4 --> 0:25:39,52
Give us a hand?
Earn your keep while you're 'ere.


432
0:25:39,52 --> 0:25:44,44
Yeah, no probs.


433
0:25:44,44 --> 0:25:45,68
What was that for?


434
0:25:45,68 --> 0:25:47,6
You've made summat of yourself.


435
0:25:47,6 --> 0:25:59,24
And you don't let anybody
fuck it up for you.


436
0:25:59,24 --> 0:26:1,84
So...


437
0:26:1,84 --> 0:26:4,24
How are we gonna make
this work, then?


438
0:26:4,24 --> 0:26:5,68
How d'you mean?


439
0:26:5,68 --> 0:26:8,4
Monthly retainer.


440
0:26:8,4 --> 0:26:11,88
Little bit extra if we need
something more specific.


441
0:26:11,88 --> 0:26:14,88
Fuck off! I'm a probationer
for two years!


442
0:26:14,88 --> 0:26:18,12
I'll be mainly making cuppas and
having the piss taken out of me.


443
0:26:18,12 --> 0:26:20,96
Yeah, well, call it a long-term
investment, then.


444
0:26:20,96 --> 0:26:25,48
You'll be able to buy yourself
a nice little runaround before long.


445
0:26:25,48 --> 0:26:29,4
Look, I'll never land you in it, J.
You know that.


446
0:26:29,4 --> 0:26:31,4
But I'll always be me own man.


447
0:26:31,4 --> 0:26:37,8
We can't talk about this again.


448
0:26:37,8 --> 0:26:40,4
Besides, half of these are
doubled-up, you tight bastard!


449
0:26:40,4 --> 0:26:42,8
Yeah, couldn't get to the
fucking bank before it shut,


450
0:26:42,8 --> 0:26:44,28
could I?


451
0:26:44,28 --> 0:26:44,92
So what we shifting?


452
0:26:44,92 --> 0:26:52,6
These big bastards over 'ere.


453
0:26:52,6 --> 0:26:57,8
Hey, they don't skimp on expenses
for the corporate raiders, d'they?


454
0:26:57,8 --> 0:27:1,0
I won't lie to you.
So you feeling better?


455
0:27:1,0 --> 0:27:4,12
What? I regard you bringing me
here as a hostile action.


456
0:27:4,12 --> 0:27:5,56
You were destitute!
You ungrateful pig.


457
0:27:5,56 --> 0:27:8,2
Temporarily, I think you'll find!


458
0:27:8,2 --> 0:27:11,84
Daniella! Please excuse Mrs Feeney.
We're a very close team,


459
0:27:11,84 --> 0:27:13,88
and she's naturally protective.


460
0:27:13,88 --> 0:27:17,6
"Mrs?" Really?
Somebody need a passport?


461
0:27:17,6 --> 0:27:21,8
Er, would you leave us, please?


462
0:27:21,8 --> 0:27:26,8
So, Frank, I am curious.


463
0:27:26,8 --> 0:27:30,8
Were there no family that
could take you in? No friends?


464
0:27:30,8 --> 0:27:32,76
Social evolution in practice.


465
0:27:32,76 --> 0:27:34,32
What?


466
0:27:34,32 --> 0:27:35,84
I wear glasses.


467
0:27:35,84 --> 0:27:39,4
Right?


468
0:27:39,4 --> 0:27:41,36
These. Slippery slope.


469
0:27:41,36 --> 0:27:45,32
Galapagos Islands round our way.
If you're weak, you'll be savaged.


470
0:27:45,32 --> 0:27:48,84
If I am fucking, this, man!


471
0:27:48,84 --> 0:27:52,48
Cunts in this place will eat me
alive, without a second thought.


472
0:27:52,48 --> 0:27:53,6
Thanks to you lot!


473
0:27:53,6 --> 0:27:54,88
My lot?


474
0:27:54,88 --> 0:27:58,24
Oh, come on, don't pretend
you're "Of the people."


475
0:27:58,24 --> 0:28:3,16
Your fucking shoes alone would buy
a three-bed semi in my street(!)


476
0:28:3,16 --> 0:28:5,12
Come on! People are, y'know,


477
0:28:5,12 --> 0:28:9,84
they're tired of this "them and us"
mentality, aren't they?


478
0:28:9,84 --> 0:28:13,72
Always seems to be the Old Etonians


479
0:28:13,72 --> 0:28:17,4
telling the rest we live
in a classless society


480
0:28:17,4 --> 0:28:20,92
as they pass laws to deregulate
around their investments.


481
0:28:20,92 --> 0:28:23,84
The old divides don't apply.


482
0:28:23,84 --> 0:28:26,24
It's about survival, nowadays.


483
0:28:26,24 --> 0:28:29,0
Hey, your neighbours weren't slow
to cast you out, hmm?


484
0:28:29,0 --> 0:28:32,2
D'you think they're worried about
what's become of you now?


485
0:28:32,2 --> 0:28:33,92
I suspect not.


486
0:28:33,92 --> 0:28:36,44
We want the same thing.


487
0:28:36,44 --> 0:28:38,8
You scratch my back...


488
0:28:38,8 --> 0:28:42,32
Oh, God!


489
0:28:42,32 --> 0:28:46,12
Well, I wondered when
this was coming up.


490
0:28:46,12 --> 0:28:47,88
OK.


491
0:28:47,88 --> 0:28:53,56
No more free lunches, eh?


492
0:28:53,56 --> 0:28:57,24
Oh! I was thinking more...


493
0:28:57,24 --> 0:29:0,52
information, and less...


494
0:29:0,52 --> 0:29:6,72
penis.


495
0:29:6,72 --> 0:29:9,6
Derek Molinari.


496
0:29:9,6 --> 0:29:12,72
What a fucking chancer!


497
0:29:12,72 --> 0:29:16,36
Punches in for his shift
at Meinhoffer's.


498
0:29:16,36 --> 0:29:17,68
Ching!


499
0:29:17,68 --> 0:29:22,84
And then heads out to the bookies
all day,


500
0:29:22,84 --> 0:29:28,36
only stepping out to sign-on
every Thursday.


501
0:29:28,36 --> 0:29:30,48
Bet he's not the worst!


502
0:29:30,48 --> 0:29:34,92
Oh, not by a long shot!


503
0:29:34,92 --> 0:29:39,88
I tell you who's a lying twat!
He never shares his smokes.


504
0:29:39,88 --> 0:29:42,76
Biscuit-arse Pettigrew.


505
0:29:42,76 --> 0:29:45,6
Ronnie, to his mother.


506
0:29:45,6 --> 0:29:51,36
Apart from 'aving BO that could
fell a fucking buffalo at 20 paces,


507
0:29:51,36 --> 0:29:57,12
he's claiming on four
different addresses.


508
0:29:57,12 --> 0:29:59,64
And does he share
the goodies around?


509
0:29:59,64 --> 0:30:7,88
Did Jesus have a rubber cross?


510
0:30:7,88 --> 0:30:10,48
Thought I was going to
run out of tape.


511
0:30:10,48 --> 0:30:12,64
Would you like me to have
your room cleared?


512
0:30:12,64 --> 0:30:15,56
That's not my room!
Ooh, I wouldn't let that stench


513
0:30:15,56 --> 0:30:18,4
anywhere near the place
where I lay my head.


514
0:30:18,4 --> 0:30:19,76
No, I'm over here.


515
0:30:19,76 --> 0:30:30,6
OK, would you like a wake-up call,
Miss? I could bring you a coffee?


516
0:30:30,6 --> 0:30:33,12
(If you were mine,


517
0:30:33,12 --> 0:30:37,92
(I'd have a cast made
of your magnificent breasts,


518
0:30:37,92 --> 0:30:43,92
(and this tongue would probe


519
0:30:43,92 --> 0:30:47,28
(and plunge deep... )


520
0:30:47,28 --> 0:30:51,6
Front-bottom, not back...


521
0:30:51,6 --> 0:30:53,16
Did you say something?


522
0:30:53,16 --> 0:30:55,88
No, Miss, I was just
thinking, erm...


523
0:30:55,88 --> 0:30:56,96
Night, Feeney.


524
0:30:56,96 --> 0:31:3,32
Good night, Miss.


525
0:31:3,32 --> 0:31:5,92
DOG BARKING


526
0:31:5,92 --> 0:31:8,0
What the fuck?


527
0:31:8,0 --> 0:31:9,92
Argh, I don't carry cash!


528
0:31:9,92 --> 0:31:13,68
Me arse isn't clean!


529
0:31:13,68 --> 0:31:17,732
(MICKY LAUGHS LOUDLY)


530
0:31:17,732 --> 0:31:18,803
Go on!


531
0:31:18,803 --> 0:31:20,63
TELEVISION BLARES


532
0:31:20,63 --> 0:31:22,72
Yes, Kelly?


533
0:31:22,72 --> 0:31:25,72
(VOICE ON TELEVISION) All you're
planning to do is sit back


534
0:31:25,72 --> 0:31:28,84
and carry on selling 100 quid's
worth of weed a week!


535
0:31:28,84 --> 0:31:32,72
Micky, d'you mind? Can't be
doing with telly first thing.


536
0:31:32,72 --> 0:31:36,4
Oh, it's brilliant, this one!
They get the DNA and they find out...


537
0:31:36,4 --> 0:31:38,72
There's no fucking milk!


538
0:31:38,72 --> 0:31:41,2
Marty's got something to ask you.


539
0:31:41,2 --> 0:31:41,68
Well, see, I...


540
0:31:41,68 --> 0:31:45,0
You need to move out.


541
0:31:45,0 --> 0:31:46,4
What?


542
0:31:46,4 --> 0:31:47,52
We're nesting.


543
0:31:47,52 --> 0:31:52,36
We need room for the baby, mate.


544
0:31:52,36 --> 0:31:54,88
But I was gonna help you, you know.


545
0:31:54,88 --> 0:31:56,96
Like the Three Musketeers.


546
0:31:56,96 --> 0:31:59,2
No, we're like the two musketeers,
and you're like a bloke


547
0:31:59,2 --> 0:32:3,36
who insists on crashing with us,
and won't take a fucking hint!


548
0:32:3,36 --> 0:32:5,24
You've been hinting?


549
0:32:5,24 --> 0:32:8,44
In neon, with megaphones! Had a
biplane fly past the other day,


550
0:32:8,44 --> 0:32:11,48
trailing a banner. "Micky,
have the sense you were born with


551
0:32:11,48 --> 0:32:12,72
"and get the fuck out."


552
0:32:12,72 --> 0:32:14,96
You're a brilliant flatmate...


553
0:32:14,96 --> 0:32:21,522
No, you're right.
Your needs are greater.


554
0:32:21,522 --> 0:32:22,96
Don't be like that!


555
0:32:22,96 --> 0:32:26,4
I'll be gone in an hour.


556
0:32:26,4 --> 0:32:32,92
Think you were direct enough?


557
0:32:32,92 --> 0:32:35,36
Why can't you crash
in the dormobile?


558
0:32:35,36 --> 0:32:39,32
Oh, I don't get the keys for that!
They know I'd sell the rust bucket!


559
0:32:39,32 --> 0:32:42,32
Don't wash your gonads in the sink!
Other people have to brush


560
0:32:42,32 --> 0:32:43,36
their teeth there!


561
0:32:43,36 --> 0:32:44,84
Where you gonna kip tonight?


562
0:32:44,84 --> 0:32:47,96
Wherever I lay my hat, son.


563
0:32:47,96 --> 0:32:50,48
I was born under a wandering star.


564
0:32:50,48 --> 0:32:53,16
I need no man. I am a rock.


565
0:32:53,16 --> 0:32:56,92
A rock? Frank, you're washing
yourself in me brother's gaffe,


566
0:32:56,92 --> 0:33:1,0
and rolling on deodorant
supplied by the bollock-washer!


567
0:33:1,0 --> 0:33:3,52
Trust me, it's every man
for himself.


568
0:33:3,52 --> 0:33:7,84
Only the strongest will survive.


569
0:33:7,84 --> 0:33:11,44
Don't... Don't do that.


570
0:33:11,44 --> 0:33:14,52
CHATTERING


571
0:33:14,52 --> 0:33:17,72
Keep your strength!
All for one, one for all.


572
0:33:17,72 --> 0:33:29,76
You don't fool me
for a fucking minute!


573
0:33:29,76 --> 0:33:32,92
All right, Shane,
what's the abuse today?


574
0:33:32,92 --> 0:33:39,397
Go on! Do your worst, I'm a big boy.


575
0:33:39,397 --> 0:33:44,648
You all right?


576
0:33:44,648 --> 0:33:55,32
I got you something.


577
0:33:55,32 --> 0:33:57,451
What am I looking at?


578
0:33:57,451 --> 0:34:1,6
All of 'em! Any one you like.
Might as well aim high.


579
0:34:1,6 --> 0:34:3,96
Time to move on.


580
0:34:3,96 --> 0:34:5,16
Finally!


581
0:34:5,16 --> 0:34:8,96
What if I don't want to?
I like it here.


582
0:34:8,96 --> 0:34:15,12
It's what we always said we'd do,
when I graduated.


583
0:34:15,12 --> 0:34:19,56
I think we were wrong to want that.


584
0:34:19,56 --> 0:34:21,76
I think we're right.


585
0:34:21,76 --> 0:34:25,32
Mate, you need to make
the most of it while you can.


586
0:34:25,32 --> 0:34:27,28
Random drugs tests and all that.


587
0:34:27,28 --> 0:34:30,68
Fuck off!


588
0:34:30,68 --> 0:34:34,48
Besides, I don't think I
can go through with it.


589
0:34:34,48 --> 0:34:35,52
What?


590
0:34:35,52 --> 0:34:37,64
Passing out ceremony.


591
0:34:37,64 --> 0:34:42,0
So you did all the training,
but you're not gonna graduate?


592
0:34:42,0 --> 0:34:43,28
What's the point in that?


593
0:34:43,28 --> 0:34:44,68
I can't, not...


594
0:34:44,68 --> 0:34:47,0
Not without me Dad's blessing.


595
0:34:47,0 --> 0:34:49,36
Fuck your Dad!


596
0:34:49,36 --> 0:34:51,12
If I go, who's gonna look after 'im?


597
0:34:51,12 --> 0:34:52,36
Look, he's a survivor.


598
0:34:52,36 --> 0:34:55,16
If there's no-one there to
protect him from himself,


599
0:34:55,16 --> 0:34:58,64
he'll be dead within 18 month.


600
0:34:58,64 --> 0:35:1,56
I can't do that to him.


601
0:35:1,56 --> 0:35:5,24
I can't let him cut me off.


602
0:35:5,24 --> 0:35:13,16
DOOR BANGS


603
0:35:13,16 --> 0:35:18,28
Miss, no-one's answering their doors!


604
0:35:18,28 --> 0:35:22,16
DOOR SLAMS


605
0:35:22,16 --> 0:35:26,28
I haven't the patience for this.
Call a town meeting.


606
0:35:26,28 --> 0:35:28,2
Put our cards on the table.


607
0:35:28,2 --> 0:35:30,0
Are you sure?


608
0:35:30,0 --> 0:35:33,32
What we're doing is for the good
of these people.


609
0:35:33,32 --> 0:35:37,682
It's time they understood that.


610
0:35:37,682 --> 0:35:43,44
That's 75% of benefit claims
in this area are fraudulent...


611
0:35:43,44 --> 0:35:47,28
They're not fraudulent, they're
rejected. There's a difference.


612
0:35:47,28 --> 0:35:49,953
Parliamentary procedure!


613
0:35:49,953 --> 0:35:51,789
Miss Kenaway has the floor.


614
0:35:51,789 --> 0:35:54,75
If you want to make an
interjection, approach the


615
0:35:54,75 --> 0:36:0,16
microphone and the chair
will recognise you.


616
0:36:0,16 --> 0:36:1,52
You heard me.


617
0:36:1,52 --> 0:36:3,494
MURMURS OF AGREEMENT


618
0:36:3,494 --> 0:36:7,0
The thing is, you have got to
pay your way and, more importantly...


619
0:36:7,0 --> 0:36:8,96
Don't lose your head.


620
0:36:8,96 --> 0:36:10,8
This matters to me.


621
0:36:10,8 --> 0:36:11,16
Why?


622
0:36:11,16 --> 0:36:13,48
Because if I fuck them,
I fuck myself.


623
0:36:13,48 --> 0:36:16,12
I don't buy into all this
nobility bollocks.


624
0:36:16,12 --> 0:36:20,6
Yeah, you do. You can't fool me.


625
0:36:20,6 --> 0:36:22,2
I know you.


626
0:36:22,2 --> 0:36:24,44
But we can't go on like this.


627
0:36:24,44 --> 0:36:29,8
Less than 15% of residents pay
any council tax at all.


628
0:36:29,8 --> 0:36:30,76
No wonder!
Order!


629
0:36:30,76 --> 0:36:33,814
Why...


630
0:36:33,814 --> 0:36:37,84
Why should anyone pay
council tax round here?


631
0:36:37,84 --> 0:36:39,36
The state of the roads!


632
0:36:39,36 --> 0:36:41,8
Half the streetlights haven't
worked in a year.


633
0:36:41,8 --> 0:36:44,44
APPLAUSE AND MURMURS OF AGREEMENT


634
0:36:44,44 --> 0:36:48,547
You're making my point for me.
The Chatsworth is a failed estate.


635
0:36:48,547 --> 0:36:51,44
It might be a shithole,
but it's our shithole!


636
0:36:51,44 --> 0:36:54,84
No-one wants to move here.
You can't expect the authorities


637
0:36:54,84 --> 0:36:57,12
to keep on throwing
good money after bad.


638
0:36:57,12 --> 0:36:59,0
Invest.


639
0:36:59,0 --> 0:37:2,4
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE


640
0:37:2,4 --> 0:37:6,408
Right, OK, I know for a fact
that someone in this room


641
0:37:6,408 --> 0:37:10,54
works at the Meinhoff brewery,
and is claiming disability benefit.


642
0:37:10,54 --> 0:37:13,24
Someone else, lives in... Anchor Way,


643
0:37:13,24 --> 0:37:17,16
is claiming on
four separate addresses.


644
0:37:17,16 --> 0:37:22,32
Swing a cat, and you'll hit
half a dozen. That'snotthe point.


645
0:37:22,32 --> 0:37:25,17
Order!


646
0:37:25,17 --> 0:37:28,635
Well, what is the point?


647
0:37:28,635 --> 0:37:32,92
I'm waiting.


648
0:37:32,92 --> 0:37:36,4
Stop punishing people who can't
defend themselves.


649
0:37:36,4 --> 0:37:37,84
We're not punishing anyone.


650
0:37:37,84 --> 0:37:38,88
Yeah, you are.


651
0:37:38,88 --> 0:37:40,72
This places sticks in your craw


652
0:37:40,72 --> 0:37:43,24
because we're a dent on
the balance sheet.


653
0:37:43,24 --> 0:37:46,56
And the fucking balance sheet
is your god, correct?


654
0:37:46,56 --> 0:37:48,64
CHEERING


655
0:37:48,64 --> 0:37:51,0
This operation will continue
whether you co-operate or not.


656
0:37:51,0 --> 0:37:54,821
Fine.


657
0:37:54,821 --> 0:37:56,2
Bring it on.


658
0:37:56,2 --> 0:38:0,48
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE


659
0:38:0,48 --> 0:38:1,88
You're barred!


660
0:38:1,88 --> 0:38:3,4
Why do I get the feeling I've
just been set up?


661
0:38:3,4 --> 0:38:4,88
Because you have.


662
0:38:4,88 --> 0:38:6,44
Told you I knew you.


663
0:38:6,44 --> 0:38:20,4
You do realise we've just
declared war?


664
0:38:20,4 --> 0:38:21,6
Whatare you doing?


665
0:38:21,6 --> 0:38:23,12
How d'you mean?


666
0:38:23,12 --> 0:38:24,96
I told you that stuff in confidence.


667
0:38:24,96 --> 0:38:28,12
You're the one who doesn't
believe in society.


668
0:38:28,12 --> 0:38:30,68
Doesn't mean I want to
join in the goose-stepping!


669
0:38:30,68 --> 0:38:33,24
Oh, this isn't about class.


670
0:38:33,24 --> 0:38:35,2
We're not the SS.


671
0:38:35,2 --> 0:38:37,96
It's about people
getting away with it.


672
0:38:37,96 --> 0:38:41,32
They bought shares in utilities,
and satellite dishes


673
0:38:41,32 --> 0:38:43,64
when the going was good.


674
0:38:43,64 --> 0:38:46,418
They?


675
0:38:46,418 --> 0:38:49,56
Who arethey?


676
0:38:49,56 --> 0:38:52,88
They are the people who might be
a little bit funny


677
0:38:52,88 --> 0:38:57,113
if they knew that you and me
had been chatting.


678
0:38:57,113 --> 0:39:7,46
Keep your ears open, Frank.
I want to know whattheyare doing.


679
0:39:7,46 --> 0:39:10,88
Shit.


680
0:39:10,88 --> 0:39:11,72
20 cigs. Come on.


681
0:39:11,72 --> 0:39:13,0
No.


682
0:39:13,0 --> 0:39:14,68
Why the fuck not?


683
0:39:14,68 --> 0:39:16,234
Cos you're a tosser.


684
0:39:16,234 --> 0:39:19,16
Serve him, Ches.


685
0:39:19,16 --> 0:39:22,44
It's all right, forget it.
I think I've just lost me craving.


686
0:39:22,44 --> 0:39:23,84
You should be proud of Carl.


687
0:39:23,84 --> 0:39:26,0
Proud? Proud?! Of that traitor?


688
0:39:26,0 --> 0:39:27,64
Yeah!


689
0:39:27,64 --> 0:39:28,92
Not the traitor bit, though.


690
0:39:28,92 --> 0:39:30,12
What is your problem?


691
0:39:30,12 --> 0:39:32,64
What, the truth? Yeah.


692
0:39:32,64 --> 0:39:36,2
You are not like
your brothers and sisters.


693
0:39:36,2 --> 0:39:40,68
You are destined for
far lesser things.


694
0:39:40,68 --> 0:39:41,88
Cheeky bastard.


695
0:39:41,88 --> 0:39:44,4
You were my one great hope.


696
0:39:44,4 --> 0:39:46,96
The salvation of my loins.


697
0:39:46,96 --> 0:39:49,84
We fuck up.


698
0:39:49,84 --> 0:39:51,92
We turn the other cheek.
We run away.


699
0:39:51,92 --> 0:39:53,8
It's our DNA.


700
0:39:53,8 --> 0:39:56,68
Rotten to the core.
Like father like son.


701
0:39:56,68 --> 0:39:58,12
I'm nothing like you.


702
0:39:58,12 --> 0:39:59,68
Ohhh!


703
0:39:59,68 --> 0:40:1,16
I'm not.


704
0:40:1,16 --> 0:40:3,2
Ohhh!


705
0:40:3,2 --> 0:40:7,48
What are you doing?


706
0:40:7,48 --> 0:40:8,8
You're freaking me out, you tit.


707
0:40:8,8 --> 0:40:10,24
This job won't last.


708
0:40:10,24 --> 0:40:12,427
The real you's in there


709
0:40:12,427 --> 0:40:15,12
fighting to get out.


710
0:40:15,12 --> 0:40:25,32
And I am counting down the days...


711
0:40:25,32 --> 0:40:27,36
Know what gets me, though?


712
0:40:27,36 --> 0:40:31,2
Some fucker's grassing them up,
passing on details, and that.


713
0:40:31,2 --> 0:40:33,4
It's not right.


714
0:40:33,4 --> 0:40:35,8
I fucking hate grasses.


715
0:40:35,8 --> 0:40:37,72
Yeah, they know how to
treat them in Iraq and Iran,


716
0:40:37,72 --> 0:40:39,32
you know, in the Middle East.


717
0:40:39,32 --> 0:40:40,8
Cut their heads off, man...


718
0:40:40,8 --> 0:40:44,16
Wha-a-ahhh...


719
0:40:44,16 --> 0:40:46,76
No messing about.


720
0:40:46,76 --> 0:40:48,96
They decapitate you
for shopping someone?


721
0:40:48,96 --> 0:40:52,12
Yeah! Big, curly sword. Wha-tcha!


722
0:40:52,12 --> 0:40:53,6
They've got the right idea, mate.


723
0:40:53,6 --> 0:40:55,88
Nah, nah, nah, nah.


724
0:40:55,88 --> 0:40:59,64
The Irish,
they had the right idea.


725
0:40:59,64 --> 0:41:4,32
They tarred and feathered the
informants, tied 'em to lampposts...


726
0:41:4,32 --> 0:41:6,52
Come on! Please.


727
0:41:6,52 --> 0:41:9,6
Could get hypothermia.


728
0:41:9,6 --> 0:41:11,8
Fucking bird flu, maybe.


729
0:41:11,8 --> 0:41:12,4
Fuck off!


730
0:41:12,4 --> 0:41:20,8
Like turkeys at Christmas.


731
0:41:20,8 --> 0:41:22,16
Morning.


732
0:41:22,16 --> 0:41:23,48
Morning, sir.


733
0:41:23,48 --> 0:41:28,24
CHEERING


734
0:41:28,24 --> 0:41:29,6
Yeah, fuck off.


735
0:41:29,6 --> 0:41:31,72
Our very own little Che Guevara!


736
0:41:31,72 --> 0:41:32,98
Who's that?


737
0:41:32,98 --> 0:41:35,4
- The one on the T-shirts.
- Footballer?


738
0:41:35,4 --> 0:41:37,8
Yeah.


739
0:41:37,8 --> 0:41:45,6
What's your fucking hair like,
today?


740
0:41:45,6 --> 0:41:47,6
Where's Karen Maguire, please?


741
0:41:47,6 --> 0:41:48,44
Kiss my dick.


742
0:41:48,44 --> 0:41:50,48
Perhaps your mother has
better manners.


743
0:41:50,48 --> 0:41:53,92
I'll tear your fucking head off
and shit in your neck.


744
0:41:53,92 --> 0:41:55,68
I'm here.


745
0:41:55,68 --> 0:41:58,84
Your licence to sell alcohol
on these premises has suspended


746
0:41:58,84 --> 0:42:0,48
pending investigation.


747
0:42:0,48 --> 0:42:1,96
Investigation of what?


748
0:42:1,96 --> 0:42:5,64
Several possible contraventions
of the Licensing Act 2003,


749
0:42:5,64 --> 0:42:9,24
including letting patrons
spend the night at the location.


750
0:42:9,24 --> 0:42:11,24
You don't have the right
to serve these.


751
0:42:11,24 --> 0:42:13,241
Oh, this is a
multi-agency operation.


752
0:42:13,241 --> 0:42:15,76
It's tobacco and alcohol too.
It's across the board.


753
0:42:15,76 --> 0:42:18,64
Fine! Go ahead, suspend the licence.


754
0:42:18,64 --> 0:42:19,88
We'll give the drink away.


755
0:42:19,88 --> 0:42:20,8
CHEERING
What?!


756
0:42:20,8 --> 0:42:22,76
We'll give it away.
We can take the hit.


757
0:42:22,76 --> 0:42:28,4
This place doesn't close. Ever.
You won't starve us out.


758
0:42:28,4 --> 0:42:43,24
I'll have a triple voddie,
Rockefeller.


759
0:42:43,24 --> 0:42:45,12
Could you help me out, please?


760
0:42:45,12 --> 0:42:52,36
I've been in here since Tuesday.


761
0:42:52,36 --> 0:42:55,8
Could you not put a little more
on the deposit?


762
0:42:55,8 --> 0:42:58,6
For an extra 2,000
you could get this one.


763
0:42:58,6 --> 0:43:0,72
It has a downstairs toilet.
Be perfect for me.


764
0:43:0,72 --> 0:43:1,8
You?


765
0:43:1,8 --> 0:43:4,88
You're going to have to
get used to the idea


766
0:43:4,88 --> 0:43:7,64
that this could be
a permanent living arrangement.


767
0:43:7,64 --> 0:43:10,84
You're welcome to stay until you
sort out alternative accommodation,


768
0:43:10,84 --> 0:43:15,0
but for the first time in my life,
I could be approved for a mortgage


769
0:43:15,0 --> 0:43:17,4
and it's for my family's future,
only.


770
0:43:17,4 --> 0:43:17,96
We may never get our house back.


771
0:43:17,96 --> 0:43:19,24
KNOCKING AT DOOR


772
0:43:19,24 --> 0:43:23,16
You wouldn't cast a destitute
pensioner out onto the streets?


773
0:43:23,16 --> 0:43:27,72
If I had to, yeah.


774
0:43:27,72 --> 0:43:28,84
Jackson Powell?


775
0:43:28,84 --> 0:43:29,64
Yeah?


776
0:43:29,64 --> 0:43:33,92
We're from Operation New Start.


777
0:43:33,92 --> 0:43:38,12
You claimed income support
whilst under going teacher training.


778
0:43:38,12 --> 0:43:39,76
Yes, yes, but that's...


779
0:43:39,76 --> 0:43:44,4
You also received a maintenance
grant to the sum of Â£2,906.


780
0:43:44,4 --> 0:43:46,52
No, no. It's not...
You don't under...


781
0:43:46,52 --> 0:43:49,4
and a teacher trainee bursary
to the sum of Â£6,000.


782
0:43:49,4 --> 0:43:51,6
You can't expect a man
who has family to provide for


783
0:43:51,6 --> 0:43:52,72
to live off that alone.


784
0:43:52,72 --> 0:43:56,4
On family tax credits


785
0:43:56,4 --> 0:44:3,56
over a period of four years.


786
0:44:3,56 --> 0:44:7,8
You're not listening to me.
My family need it.


787
0:44:7,8 --> 0:44:10,4
Every penny goes on our survival!
I'm like you.


788
0:44:10,4 --> 0:44:25,4
An honest working man.


789
0:44:25,4 --> 0:44:30,715
That's the last of it.


790
0:44:30,715 --> 0:44:32,48
Micky...


791
0:44:32,48 --> 0:44:36,2
I'm... sorry...
We owe you big time.


792
0:44:36,2 --> 0:44:38,32
If circumstances were different,
we'd love you to stay...


793
0:44:38,32 --> 0:44:40,39
I could babysit...


794
0:44:40,39 --> 0:44:45,6
No, get the fuck out!
Get a fucking life!


795
0:44:45,6 --> 0:44:48,92
Don't have to tell me twice.


796
0:44:48,92 --> 0:44:50,56
Oh, you going somewhere?


797
0:44:50,56 --> 0:44:52,0
I'm moving out.


798
0:44:52,0 --> 0:44:58,32
You all are. Council-sponsored
court-sanctioned eviction order.


799
0:44:58,32 --> 0:45:1,92
(CHUCKLES)


800
0:45:1,92 --> 0:45:4,84
I'm being prosecuted.
Can you believe that?


801
0:45:4,84 --> 0:45:7,64
He invited them in,
made them a cup tea,


802
0:45:7,64 --> 0:45:10,44
which, by the way,
I've noticed neither has touched,


803
0:45:10,44 --> 0:45:12,64
and offered a light snack
for the privilege.


804
0:45:12,64 --> 0:45:15,16
They've made a mistake.
We're not dole scroungers.


805
0:45:15,16 --> 0:45:17,4
There's no point.
I'm signing off, anyway.


806
0:45:17,4 --> 0:45:18,96
I'm a qualified teacher now.


807
0:45:18,96 --> 0:45:20,52
I've got a post at St Morrissey's...


808
0:45:20,52 --> 0:45:24,0
My husband has no comment.
Both of you,


809
0:45:24,0 --> 0:45:27,64
out of my fucking house now.


810
0:45:27,64 --> 0:45:36,2
Not another word!


811
0:45:36,2 --> 0:45:40,72
We'll be in touch.


812
0:45:40,72 --> 0:45:43,0
Did you see the way
he just looked at me?


813
0:45:43,0 --> 0:45:47,6
Like they would Frank Gallagher! How
fucking dare they? I'll fix this.


814
0:45:47,6 --> 0:45:49,56
That's fine, then, isn't it?


815
0:45:49,56 --> 0:45:54,8
Just in case, put this pot
away somewhere safe.


816
0:45:54,8 --> 0:45:56,81
Cos after that lot get
through with us, at


817
0:45:56,81 --> 0:45:58,44
least we'll have something
left to piss in.


818
0:45:58,44 --> 0:45:59,12
Pasta do you for lunch?


819
0:45:59,12 --> 0:46:1,76
Oh, I can't stand
feckin' Italian food...


820
0:46:1,76 --> 0:46:8,44
Pasta would be lovely.


821
0:46:8,44 --> 0:46:13,84
Four quid! Come on!
Can't sell them in the shop.


822
0:46:13,84 --> 0:46:17,6
Look at 'em all. What have we done?


823
0:46:17,6 --> 0:46:19,36
Come on, boys!
Get your pennies out!


824
0:46:19,36 --> 0:46:20,84
CHEERING


825
0:46:20,84 --> 0:46:22,88
God knows.


826
0:46:22,88 --> 0:46:26,4
Pint and an orange.


827
0:46:26,4 --> 0:46:27,76
Put a large voddie in it.


828
0:46:27,76 --> 0:46:35,84
Bairn's got to get
used to it sometime.


829
0:46:35,84 --> 0:46:37,2
Go on, what you having?


830
0:46:37,2 --> 0:46:39,96
No, you're all right, thanks,
I'm fine.


831
0:46:39,96 --> 0:46:42,48
SILENCE FALLS


832
0:46:42,48 --> 0:46:47,84
CLANGING


833
0:46:47,84 --> 0:46:50,48
For fuck's sake,
is it panto season(?)


834
0:46:50,48 --> 0:46:52,16
What have you done, Frank?


835
0:46:52,16 --> 0:46:55,8
Nothing. I've just... had me fill,
that's all.


836
0:46:55,8 --> 0:46:55,64
Frank?


837
0:46:55,64 --> 0:46:58,72
I haven't done anything!


838
0:46:58,72 --> 0:47:0,6
You're refusing a free drink?


839
0:47:0,6 --> 0:47:2,68
I'm not... I'm just...


840
0:47:2,68 --> 0:47:4,24
He's got a guilty conscience.


841
0:47:4,24 --> 0:47:7,12
About what? You threw me out.


842
0:47:7,12 --> 0:47:8,2
He's lying!
Can't even look me in the eye.


843
0:47:8,2 --> 0:47:10,48
(SIGHS)


844
0:47:10,48 --> 0:47:11,2
Swear on the kids' lives.


845
0:47:11,2 --> 0:47:13,16
I swear.


846
0:47:13,16 --> 0:47:14,8
Swear on Man City.


847
0:47:14,8 --> 0:47:15,28
I swear.


848
0:47:15,28 --> 0:47:19,12
On your mother's memory.


849
0:47:19,12 --> 0:47:21,2
MURMURING


850
0:47:21,2 --> 0:47:22,72
Grass!


851
0:47:22,72 --> 0:47:24,28
She's got us over a barrel.
If I don't...


852
0:47:24,28 --> 0:47:26,12
Fucking hell!


853
0:47:26,12 --> 0:47:28,4
No, listen!
If I don't weigh her in with info,


854
0:47:28,4 --> 0:47:30,68
she's going to fucking
hang me out to dry.


855
0:47:30,68 --> 0:47:33,48
MURMURING


856
0:47:33,48 --> 0:47:35,8
Well, come on, then!


857
0:47:35,8 --> 0:47:36,52
Come on!


858
0:47:36,52 --> 0:47:37,56
JEERING


859
0:47:37,56 --> 0:47:40,48
Bring it on, you pack of hyenas!


860
0:47:40,48 --> 0:47:45,77
Got fuck all to lose, anyway!
Come on!


861
0:47:45,77 --> 0:47:49,35
I'm just a fucking punchbag,
aren't I?


862
0:47:49,35 --> 0:47:52,47
One man's torture is another
man's justified measures.


863
0:47:52,47 --> 0:47:55,51
I mean, I don't know if I believe
in punishment for it's own sake.


864
0:47:55,51 --> 0:47:57,47
I'm more a rehabilitation
man myself.


865
0:47:57,47 --> 0:48:0,79
I'd have no conscience about it.


866
0:48:0,79 --> 0:48:4,23
I want to see him suffer.
Two-faced grassing bastard!


867
0:48:4,23 --> 0:48:7,55
They might cut your knob off.
You can still live knobless.


868
0:48:7,55 --> 0:48:10,43
Always thought it'd cause you
to bleed to death,


869
0:48:10,43 --> 0:48:12,91
but apparently not.


870
0:48:12,91 --> 0:48:16,91
You can't kill Frank.
It'd be like drowning a puppy.


871
0:48:16,91 --> 0:48:18,866
I've drowned loads of puppies.


872
0:48:18,866 --> 0:48:20,55
Trust me, it's fuck-all like this.


873
0:48:20,55 --> 0:48:22,83
Still carrying a torch
for him, are we?


874
0:48:22,83 --> 0:48:26,3
Yeah(!) I don't want him murdered,
so I'm carrying a torch for him.


875
0:48:26,3 --> 0:48:27,31
Is that your logic?


876
0:48:27,31 --> 0:48:30,19
There's loads of people
I don't want murdered,


877
0:48:30,19 --> 0:48:32,59
so that must make me
a right slapper(!)


878
0:48:32,59 --> 0:48:34,79
'It does turn you
into a soprano, though.'


879
0:48:34,79 --> 0:48:36,75
You know, high voice and all that.


880
0:48:36,75 --> 0:48:40,35
Sopranos used to be dead
valuable in history.


881
0:48:40,35 --> 0:48:43,23
When I say soprano,
I do mean castrato, obviously.


882
0:48:43,23 --> 0:48:45,99
MUFFLED CRIES


883
0:48:45,99 --> 0:48:49,51
The Pope had a whole choir
of them in the 16th century.


884
0:48:49,51 --> 0:48:52,99
MUFFLED SHOUTING


885
0:48:52,99 --> 0:48:57,7
Burn me, shoot me, drown me
at sea! I don't care what you do,


886
0:48:57,7 --> 0:49:0,71
but stop fucking talking!


887
0:49:0,71 --> 0:49:4,59
Punishing him for its own sake makes
no sense. How does it benefit us?


888
0:49:4,59 --> 0:49:6,87
It isn't supposed to benefit us.


889
0:49:6,87 --> 0:49:9,15
Maybe it is.


890
0:49:9,15 --> 0:49:11,87
Look, he spied for them, yeah?
Why can't he spy for us?


891
0:49:11,87 --> 0:49:14,51
Find out what they're
up to, bring it here?


892
0:49:14,51 --> 0:49:17,59
And maybe pass on some duff
information to them,


893
0:49:17,59 --> 0:49:18,707
while he's at it?


894
0:49:18,707 --> 0:49:21,7
What, Frank Gallagher ...
double agent?!


895
0:49:21,7 --> 0:49:28,15
Fuck me, we must be desperate!


896
0:49:28,15 --> 0:49:29,99
Look out, Mata Hari's
on the case


897
0:49:29,99 --> 0:49:33,83
Oh, ha-fucking-ha(!)
I don't have to do this.


898
0:49:33,83 --> 0:49:36,95
Shouldn't have blabbed your fucking
mouth off in the first place!


899
0:49:36,95 --> 0:49:40,19
You owe us, all of us. Big time.


900
0:49:40,19 --> 0:49:42,67
I know... that!


901
0:49:42,67 --> 0:49:46,47
That's why I'm trying
to put things right, aren't I?


902
0:49:46,47 --> 0:49:50,3
Finding out what they're
up to so you...


903
0:49:50,3 --> 0:49:52,99
wehave got a fighting
chance of stopping them.


904
0:49:52,99 --> 0:50:4,83
Good luck.


905
0:50:4,83 --> 0:50:8,39
Big, big, big plans.


906
0:50:8,39 --> 0:50:9,87
Hm, pray tell.


907
0:50:9,87 --> 0:50:10,99
It's bribery.


908
0:50:10,99 --> 0:50:14,19
Need to keep a close
eye on your team.


909
0:50:14,19 --> 0:50:16,91
Someone on the inside's passing
info in exchange for readies.


910
0:50:16,91 --> 0:50:19,39
Get Frank another drink, yeah?


911
0:50:19,39 --> 0:50:22,7
I think it helps him to talk
more... freely.


912
0:50:22,7 --> 0:50:24,27
(LAUGHS) OK.


913
0:50:24,27 --> 0:50:28,55
So Frank, what sort of information
are they supplying exactly?


914
0:50:28,55 --> 0:50:32,27
It's like addresses of where
you're going to swoop next.


915
0:50:32,27 --> 0:50:34,47
When are you swooping?


916
0:50:34,47 --> 0:50:37,39
You know, matter of interest?


917
0:50:37,39 --> 0:50:40,35
Carmen! Carmen!


918
0:50:40,35 --> 0:50:44,31
I couldn't find you!


919
0:50:44,31 --> 0:50:46,59
I have no sympathy or time for this.


920
0:50:46,59 --> 0:50:47,83
I love you!


921
0:50:47,83 --> 0:50:51,15
I used to be at
your beck and call...


922
0:50:51,15 --> 0:50:54,19
Oh, great(!)


923
0:50:54,19 --> 0:50:56,27
Carmen may be some time.


924
0:50:56,27 --> 0:51:0,71
Ah. I'm in no rush.


925
0:51:0,71 --> 0:51:5,43
All right, love. Your virtue's
safe with me. I may need glasses,


926
0:51:5,43 --> 0:51:11,87
but I'm not totally Stevie Wonder.


927
0:51:11,87 --> 0:51:14,796
(SLURRED) Where the fuck
has Carmen got to?


928
0:51:14,796 --> 0:51:16,718
We won't see her now.


929
0:51:16,718 --> 0:51:19,27
This always happens
when he shows up


930
0:51:19,27 --> 0:51:22,27
and she falls for it every time.


931
0:51:22,27 --> 0:51:26,27
Husband. Going through a divorce.


932
0:51:26,27 --> 0:51:30,7
He's a drunk, a womaniser.


933
0:51:30,7 --> 0:51:32,3
He'll have had his way with her


934
0:51:32,3 --> 0:51:34,95
and then run back
to the younger model.


935
0:51:34,95 --> 0:51:37,31
Men are bastards!


936
0:51:37,31 --> 0:51:41,67
Do you have a little lady crush?


937
0:51:41,67 --> 0:51:46,39
Hm?


938
0:51:46,39 --> 0:51:49,91
I, er... I touched her boob once,


939
0:51:49,91 --> 0:51:53,55
while she was asleep.
The left one.


940
0:51:53,55 --> 0:51:57,3
I just... brushed my palm


941
0:51:57,3 --> 0:52:2,95
across her nipple.


942
0:52:2,95 --> 0:52:4,87
I sleep on it now.


943
0:52:4,87 --> 0:52:8,71
Hard to tell,
cos I'm so pissed, but...


944
0:52:8,71 --> 0:52:12,87
I might've just come in me pants.


945
0:52:12,87 --> 0:52:15,19
You're all stuffed, though.
You know that.


946
0:52:15,19 --> 0:52:16,67
What?


947
0:52:16,67 --> 0:52:20,67
It's political, like immigration


948
0:52:20,67 --> 0:52:23,47
No government can be seen


949
0:52:23,47 --> 0:52:26,43
to be supporting benefits.


950
0:52:26,43 --> 0:52:33,31
The underbelly is a cancer.


951
0:52:33,31 --> 0:52:36,11
Shall we have another drink?


952
0:52:36,11 --> 0:52:37,15
Oh, no!


953
0:52:37,15 --> 0:52:40,15
Go on! You know you want to.


954
0:52:40,15 --> 0:52:41,83
Ah, go on!


955
0:52:41,83 --> 0:52:46,35
Oh, all right. Then we call
it a day. I need to, er...


956
0:52:46,35 --> 0:53:10,39
Leave the table here.


957
0:53:10,39 --> 0:53:11,43
Where's Feeney?


958
0:53:11,43 --> 0:53:16,95
GLASS CLINKING


959
0:53:16,95 --> 0:53:17,95
What you doing?


960
0:53:17,95 --> 0:53:19,67
I just... I...


961
0:53:19,67 --> 0:53:23,23
I dropped me glasses.


962
0:53:23,23 --> 0:53:41,71
You look shagged.


963
0:53:41,71 --> 0:53:44,31
You going somewhere?


964
0:53:44,31 --> 0:53:48,19
I don't know who you are anymore.


965
0:53:48,19 --> 0:53:49,75
Oh, I'm going somewhere!


966
0:53:49,75 --> 0:53:51,67
I don't want to be
like everyone else!


967
0:53:51,67 --> 0:53:56,31
I want two parents.


968
0:53:56,31 --> 0:53:59,7
You're so keen to move on.
I think you should.


969
0:53:59,7 --> 0:54:2,43
You're not that stupid!
15 years of marriage?


970
0:54:2,43 --> 0:54:3,87
15 years?


971
0:54:3,87 --> 0:54:7,19
Letitia! I wouldn't want you
looking down your nose at us.


972
0:54:7,19 --> 0:54:10,43
Maybe one of your better
class of mates can put you up.


973
0:54:10,43 --> 0:54:11,47
In.


974
0:54:11,47 --> 0:54:14,19
In!


975
0:54:14,19 --> 0:54:25,83
I won't be blackmailed!


976
0:54:25,83 --> 0:54:37,55
Not a fucking word!


977
0:54:37,55 --> 0:54:39,7
There you go, love.


978
0:54:39,7 --> 0:54:41,15
Cheers.


979
0:54:41,15 --> 0:54:44,91
Oh, come on, I've earned it!


980
0:54:44,91 --> 0:54:49,51
If I had my way, you'd be propping
up a bridge somewhere by now.


981
0:54:49,51 --> 0:54:52,91
Oh what, you going to stuff
your gums with orange peel?


982
0:54:52,91 --> 0:54:56,59
Tell me Luca Brazi
sleeps with the fishes?


983
0:54:56,59 --> 0:55:0,3
You don't scare me!


984
0:55:0,3 --> 0:55:1,71
We're fucked!


985
0:55:1,71 --> 0:55:4,23
They're going to evict
as many as they can,


986
0:55:4,23 --> 0:55:6,43
but there's no new tenants.


987
0:55:6,43 --> 0:55:10,55
No-one's moving in. They're going
to keep the houses empty, permanent.


988
0:55:10,55 --> 0:55:11,95
Well, that's stupid.


989
0:55:11,95 --> 0:55:14,536
No, that's clever.
Left empty, the houses'll rot.


990
0:55:14,536 --> 0:55:16,193
But then no-one'll
want to live here.


991
0:55:16,193 --> 0:55:17,794
Exactly what they want.


992
0:55:17,794 --> 0:55:20,284
They're looking to shut down
the whole estate.


993
0:55:20,284 --> 0:55:23,705
No houses, no pub,
no punters, no people.


994
0:55:23,705 --> 0:55:26,75
This'll be one of those places
people used to live.


995
0:55:26,75 --> 0:55:29,35
Well, I for one
am lying down to no bully.


996
0:55:29,35 --> 0:55:30,285
I'm with you.


997
0:55:30,285 --> 0:55:34,31
We need a plan.


998
0:55:34,31 --> 0:55:36,63
I wear them for reading sometimes.


999
0:55:36,63 --> 0:55:38,71
I wear contacts.


1000
0:55:38,71 --> 0:55:42,31
I need 'em for watching telly.


1001
0:55:42,31 --> 0:55:43,55
I don't need glasses.


1002
0:55:43,55 --> 0:55:49,763
I only wear them cos fellas can't
resist the slutty secretary look.


1003
0:55:49,763 --> 0:55:52,152
How are we going to fight them?
They've got cops and dogs.


1004
0:55:52,152 --> 0:55:53,456
They've got tasers.


1005
0:55:53,456 --> 0:55:56,27
We need to be smart.
Guerrilla warfare.


1006
0:55:56,27 --> 0:55:58,39
Yeah, French resistance!


1007
0:55:58,39 --> 0:56:0,15
But... we're not French.


1008
0:56:0,15 --> 0:56:4,23
We're all in the same fucking boat.


1009
0:56:4,23 --> 0:56:7,755
(FRANK) 'All right, so maybe
I was a bit premature.


1010
0:56:7,755 --> 0:56:11,51
'These are difficult days.


1011
0:56:11,51 --> 0:56:13,83
'You know, post banking crisis,


1012
0:56:13,83 --> 0:56:17,67
'post comprehensive spending review,


1013
0:56:17,67 --> 0:56:20,63
'cuts, cuts and more cuts.


1014
0:56:20,63 --> 0:56:25,11
'And kick the living shit
out of the underbelly


1015
0:56:25,11 --> 0:56:30,3
'cos they're least equipped
to defend themselves.


1016
0:56:30,3 --> 0:56:33,67
'The more things change,


1017
0:56:33,67 --> 0:56:51,71
'the more they stay the same, yeah?


1018
0:56:51,71 --> 0:56:54,15
'Society is dead.


1019
0:56:54,15 --> 0:56:58,7
'Long live society.'


1020
0:56:58,7 --> 0:57:0,51
Thanks to you, these people
have lost their homes.


1021
0:57:0,51 --> 0:57:1,63
Â£150,000?!


1022
0:57:1,63 --> 0:57:5,15
That's her bonus, if she manages
to permanently board up 120 houses.


1023
0:57:5,15 --> 0:57:6,59
Partner couldn't make it again?


1024
0:57:6,59 --> 0:57:8,3
'I can't do it on my own.'


1025
0:57:8,3 --> 0:57:9,11
I'll mess it up!


1026
0:57:9,11 --> 0:57:11,43
I'll mess it up! You will if you
carry on ignoring your baby.


1027
0:57:11,43 --> 0:57:13,71
Upset by a couple
of evictions, are you?


1028
0:57:13,71 --> 0:57:16,67
Ten years from now, this
place will be wasteland!


1029
0:57:16,67 --> 0:57:20,3
She has destroyed people's lives.
She's caused total mayhem!


1030
0:57:20,3 --> 0:57:24,913
You know what hormones are like? I
really need to go and ride me boy.


1031
0:57:24,913 --> 0:58:0,11
Oh, baby!

MOANING


1034
0:58:9,11 --> 0:58:12,47
There's spunk stains on the
pillowcase and dried-on lubricant!


1035
0:58:12,47 --> 0:58:17,477
It's a working house.
DOOR OPENING


1036
0:58:17,477 --> 0:58:19,75
Have you got a little stiffie
under there for me?


1037
0:58:19,75 --> 0:58:23,31
No, I've really not!


1038
0:58:23,31 --> 0:60:23,31
You'll come round eventually!
