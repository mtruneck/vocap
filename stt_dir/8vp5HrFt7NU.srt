1
0:0:1,327 --> 0:0:4,7
- Say ''ah''.
- Ah.


2
0:0:4,7 --> 0:0:7,247
- OK, say ''oh''.
- Oh.


3
0:0:7,247 --> 0:0:12,767
Everybody say ''Ah, oh, ah!''


4
0:0:12,767 --> 0:0:15,127
Excuse me.


5
0:0:15,127 --> 0:0:18,607
As legal counsellor,
it's my job to inform you


6
0:0:18,607 --> 0:0:23,287
that your suspension
is effective immediately.


7
0:0:23,287 --> 0:0:25,287
Just the messenger.


8
0:0:25,287 --> 0:0:29,287
Your long-term job status will
be decided at the board meeting.


9
0:0:29,287 --> 0:0:33,447
Until then, and l cannot bend on this,


10
0:0:33,447 --> 0:0:36,327
l don't want you
setting foot on the premises.


11
0:0:36,327 --> 0:0:40,527
- l'm going to be here all day.
- Works for me. That'd be good.


12
0:0:40,527 --> 0:0:42,487
l hope that works out.


13
0:0:42,487 --> 0:0:45,767
Dr Cox, if you need to talk...


14
0:0:45,767 --> 0:0:49,207
<i>It was weird knowing my mentor</i>
<i>could be fired tomorrow,</i>


15
0:0:49,207 --> 0:0:52,47
<i>But there's no reason</i>
<i>to feel any less confident,</i>


16
0:0:52,47 --> 0:0:54,647
<i>I'll be fine without a safety net,</i>


17
0:0:54,647 --> 0:0:59,127
What do you think, Dr Dorian?
Bypass or stent?


18
0:0:59,127 --> 0:1:2,527
Bypass!


19
0:1:2,527 --> 0:1:18,407
Or stent.


20
0:1:18,407 --> 0:1:21,647
<i>There's a lot of horrible things</i>
<i>about being an intern,</i>


21
0:1:21,647 --> 0:1:26,647
<i>Long hours constant stress</i>
<i>having to deal with death,</i>


22
0:1:26,647 --> 0:1:29,727
<i>But worst is the simple fact</i>
<i>that the average intern</i>


23
0:1:29,727 --> 0:1:33,287
<i>has to disimpact 1 5 to 20 bowels a week,</i>


24
0:1:33,287 --> 0:1:36,687
<i>There's an oath among interns</i>
<i>never to make fun of each other</i>


25
0:1:36,687 --> 0:1:39,47
<i>for doing the things we have to do,</i>


26
0:1:39,47 --> 0:1:41,727
You have to touch someone's hiney.


27
0:1:41,727 --> 0:1:44,767
Dorian, come with me. And Dr...


28
0:1:44,767 --> 0:1:46,327
- Reid.
- Sure. Why not?


29
0:1:46,327 --> 0:1:49,727
Take over for him.


30
0:1:49,727 --> 0:1:51,767
l'm assigning you to a board member


31
0:1:51,767 --> 0:1:54,887
whose family built this hospital
with their bare hands.


32
0:1:54,887 --> 0:1:56,807
<i>That can't be true,</i>


33
0:1:56,807 --> 0:1:59,887
- Look for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
- What happened?


34
0:1:59,887 --> 0:2:3,767
- Pre-syncope.
- So, this board member almost fainted?


35
0:2:3,767 --> 0:2:6,647
- l'll fire up the paddles.
- Dr Weisenheimer's back.


36
0:2:6,647 --> 0:2:8,807
- How was your ski trip?
- l'm confused.


37
0:2:8,807 --> 0:2:10,567
- You annoy me.
- Now l get it.


38
0:2:10,567 --> 0:2:14,287
But you have a charm
everyone else here seems to respond to.


39
0:2:14,287 --> 0:2:16,87
Use it. OK, sport?


40
0:2:16,87 --> 0:2:25,327
<i>Great an 80-year-old</i>
<i>grouchy pretentious,,,</i>


41
0:2:25,327 --> 0:2:28,607
<i>,,,smokin'-hot bitty,</i>


42
0:2:28,607 --> 0:2:34,527
<i>Who do you love the most?</i>


43
0:2:34,527 --> 0:2:37,207
Sweetheart, are you getting younger?


44
0:2:37,207 --> 0:2:39,407
This is Dr Dorian.


45
0:2:39,407 --> 0:2:50,207
- He'll be looking after you.
- And who will be looking after him?


46
0:2:50,207 --> 0:2:54,287
Since your jaw is wired shut,
we'll give you lV nutrition, OK?


47
0:2:54,287 --> 0:2:56,567
Sorry. lt's like the dentist.


48
0:2:56,567 --> 0:3:0,87
They ask you questions and
you have that stuff in your mouth.


49
0:3:0,87 --> 0:3:2,847
l did it again. Dr Greenberg.


50
0:3:2,847 --> 0:3:4,687
What kind of doctor are you?


51
0:3:4,687 --> 0:3:9,367
l keep doing it. Just act it out.


52
0:3:9,367 --> 0:3:11,887
Head?


53
0:3:11,887 --> 0:3:13,967
Shrinking. A shrink!


54
0:3:13,967 --> 0:3:17,607
l can't imagine picking
psychiatry as a specialty


55
0:3:17,607 --> 0:3:19,567
after interning as a real doctor.


56
0:3:19,567 --> 0:3:22,887
That didn't come out right.
My dad. He's a doctor too.


57
0:3:22,887 --> 0:3:26,527
He says therapy is for people
with more money than problems.


58
0:3:26,527 --> 0:3:31,7
But then... my dad says a lot of things.


59
0:3:31,7 --> 0:3:34,7
- Did anyone page a nurse?
- No.


60
0:3:34,7 --> 0:3:39,807
- lt looks like his eyes are screaming.
- Please, we're talking.


61
0:3:39,807 --> 0:3:42,367
Where was l?


62
0:3:42,367 --> 0:3:45,567
- You should get dressed.
- l can't. lt's still out there.


63
0:3:45,567 --> 0:3:50,207
Don't call my mother ''it''. lt implies
you think that she's a monster.


64
0:3:50,207 --> 0:3:53,7
Get a move on,
it gets up to feed about now.


65
0:3:53,7 --> 0:3:56,167
l don't understand
why we couldn't stay at my place.


66
0:3:56,167 --> 0:3:58,247
l could've done the whole show.


67
0:3:58,247 --> 0:4:0,567
- There's a show?
- Yeah, there's a show.


68
0:4:0,567 --> 0:4:4,847
lt involves music, some dancing,
occasionally singing.


69
0:4:4,847 --> 0:4:11,527
- Can you do <i>Me And Mrs Jones?</i>
- l don't know, what's she look like?


70
0:4:11,527 --> 0:4:15,927
You wanted to spend the whole night
together. l can't leave my mother alone.


71
0:4:15,927 --> 0:4:22,807
She's frail.


72
0:4:22,807 --> 0:4:26,247
Tell her to put the cane down!


73
0:4:26,247 --> 0:4:29,807
- Tell her to put the cane down!
- lt's because l'm unmarried.


74
0:4:29,807 --> 0:4:31,927
She doesn't have to know we had sex.


75
0:4:31,927 --> 0:4:34,407
- She speaks English.
- Then why translate?


76
0:4:34,407 --> 0:4:36,327
You don't speak Spanish!


77
0:4:36,327 --> 0:4:41,87
No! No!


78
0:4:41,87 --> 0:4:42,887
Tell her to put the cane down.


79
0:4:42,887 --> 0:4:45,407
l have to be honest,
when Dr Kelso said


80
0:4:45,407 --> 0:4:48,527
board member, l was thinking
this like old, grumpy...


81
0:4:48,527 --> 0:4:50,687
That would be my father. He died.


82
0:4:50,687 --> 0:4:53,207
- l'm so sorry.
- 20 years ago.


83
0:4:53,207 --> 0:4:59,207
l would have said sorry then
but l had trouble with my Ss.


84
0:4:59,207 --> 0:5:4,967
l was five. Ss.
So... how are you feeling?


85
0:5:4,967 --> 0:5:7,567
Great, that's why l'm here. Listen, RJ.


86
0:5:7,567 --> 0:5:9,807
- JD.
- Like it matters.


87
0:5:9,807 --> 0:5:13,167
You seem like a nice, spineless, boy,
so let's be honest.


88
0:5:13,167 --> 0:5:17,407
l'm here because it was the only way to
end my mother's nagging pseudo-concern.


89
0:5:17,407 --> 0:5:19,887
- That's sweet.
- So, do your little tests.


90
0:5:19,887 --> 0:5:22,127
But first, close the blinds,


91
0:5:22,127 --> 0:5:26,407
wash off your 8th-grade-dance cologne
so we don't add nausea to my symptoms.


92
0:5:26,407 --> 0:5:30,647
l'll need lemon wedges for my sparkling
water, which you've yet to get.


93
0:5:30,647 --> 0:5:33,327
- Let me just...
- Doing things l want first.


94
0:5:33,327 --> 0:5:35,967
- Your little tests later.
- Nice to meet you.


95
0:5:35,967 --> 0:5:37,447
<i>I hate you,</i>


96
0:5:37,447 --> 0:5:40,447
Merry Christmas!
l mean, happy Halloween!


97
0:5:40,447 --> 0:5:43,927
l am so frazzled.
l did not sleep at all.


98
0:5:43,927 --> 0:5:50,887
ln fact, l haven't really slept
since l started here.


99
0:5:50,887 --> 0:5:54,807
lt's so much pressure. l can't talk
to anyone here. lt's so competitive.


100
0:5:54,807 --> 0:5:57,967
l used to be able to talk to
my mom, but now, l don't know,


101
0:5:57,967 --> 0:6:6,567
she listens, but she just never
seems to hear me, you know?


102
0:6:6,567 --> 0:6:10,247
Lonely, depressed, overwhelmed.


103
0:6:10,247 --> 0:6:15,327
And sometimes l have no idea
how l'll make it through this.


104
0:6:15,327 --> 0:6:17,807
No. l don't even like to take aspirin.


105
0:6:17,807 --> 0:6:19,527
l'd rather just...


106
0:6:19,527 --> 0:6:21,87
Oh, you!


107
0:6:21,87 --> 0:6:25,167
Dr Cox. l've been
thinking about your predicament


108
0:6:25,167 --> 0:6:27,967
and l think l have a solution:
cruise ships.


109
0:6:27,967 --> 0:6:30,887
- Right.
- Everyone'll call you Doc.


110
0:6:30,887 --> 0:6:35,167
You'll visit exotic ports.
Maybe you'll even get to meet Charo.


111
0:6:35,167 --> 0:6:37,927
Enjoy this while you can, Bobby.


112
0:6:37,927 --> 0:6:40,407
lf your evil genie
does grant your wish,


113
0:6:40,407 --> 0:6:43,567
and l disappear,
the only person you'll have left


114
0:6:43,567 --> 0:6:45,767
to contend with will be yourself.


115
0:6:45,767 --> 0:6:49,207
And when you really
get to know that person,


116
0:6:49,207 --> 0:6:51,407
dear God, you'll scream so loud,


117
0:6:51,407 --> 0:6:55,887
Satan will want to rip up the contract
you signed so he can get some sleep.


118
0:6:55,887 --> 0:6:59,167
Look at you with your stiff upper lip.


119
0:6:59,167 --> 0:7:13,847
l think l'm gonna miss that the most.


120
0:7:13,847 --> 0:7:15,927
What are you looking at?


121
0:7:15,927 --> 0:7:18,727
l just... l like your shirt.


122
0:7:18,727 --> 0:7:21,247
- What kind of shirt is that?
- A white T-shirt.


123
0:7:21,247 --> 0:7:26,887
l knew it.


124
0:7:26,887 --> 0:7:29,167
l will never sleep
at your place again.


125
0:7:29,167 --> 0:7:30,807
lt wasn't that bad.


126
0:7:30,807 --> 0:7:32,807
l am in such a good mood.


127
0:7:32,807 --> 0:7:35,207
Does she invite the priest over
every day?


128
0:7:35,207 --> 0:7:38,327
Only when she finds me in bed
with some guy. So most days.


129
0:7:38,327 --> 0:7:40,847
That's not funny.
That's not funny.


130
0:7:40,847 --> 0:7:44,327
l'm just in a much better place.
Do l look different?


131
0:7:44,327 --> 0:7:47,687
What kind of a shirt is that?
l am such an idiot.


132
0:7:47,687 --> 0:7:49,687
l'm in a better place.


133
0:7:49,687 --> 0:7:52,487
What do you say, my apartment, tonight?


134
0:7:52,487 --> 0:7:54,407
l'll think about it.


135
0:7:54,407 --> 0:7:56,287
Why doesn't anyone listen to me?


136
0:7:56,287 --> 0:7:59,127
ln a better place,
look different, feel good.


137
0:7:59,127 --> 0:8:1,567
That's what happens
when you see a shrink.


138
0:8:1,567 --> 0:8:4,607
My patient is a therapist.
l'm not seeing a shrink.


139
0:8:4,607 --> 0:8:7,407
Stop spreading around
embarrassing rumours.


140
0:8:7,407 --> 0:8:12,847
l'm just goofing around. The last thing
l want to do is upset a crazy lady.


141
0:8:12,847 --> 0:8:15,167
- T-shirt.
- ls anybody up there?


142
0:8:15,167 --> 0:8:17,567
Up there... up there... up there...


143
0:8:17,567 --> 0:8:20,647
l'm all alone down here...
here... here...


144
0:8:20,647 --> 0:8:23,327
lt's cold.


145
0:8:23,327 --> 0:8:29,7
l'm frightened.


146
0:8:29,7 --> 0:8:32,527
<i>Just keep moving, Refocus,</i>


147
0:8:32,527 --> 0:8:34,647
<i>Think about helping Dr Cox,</i>


148
0:8:34,647 --> 0:8:38,367
Ms Sullivan? Sorry. l didn't
realise you're in the bathroom.


149
0:8:38,367 --> 0:8:42,7
lt's OK, come on in.


150
0:8:42,7 --> 0:8:45,247
Come in the room, not in here.
What's the matter with you?


151
0:8:45,247 --> 0:8:47,767
Are you even a real doctor?


152
0:8:47,767 --> 0:8:52,447
l know that you're on the board, and l
have this friend. Well, he's a mentor...


153
0:8:52,447 --> 0:8:55,607
- Losing interest!
- Sorry.


154
0:8:55,607 --> 0:8:57,687
Why are you dressed?


155
0:8:57,687 --> 0:9:1,167
l'm going to a party.
l assume my tests are normal.


156
0:9:1,167 --> 0:9:5,407
But l sure hope we can go down
to the river some time and race frogs.


157
0:9:5,407 --> 0:9:6,767
<i>That's it,</i>


158
0:9:6,767 --> 0:9:10,167
Listen, you spoiled,
bossy chore of a woman.


159
0:9:10,167 --> 0:9:12,927
- What'd you say?
- <i>You're in now go for it,</i>


160
0:9:12,927 --> 0:9:15,887
l'm the doctor here.
So put your gown back on,


161
0:9:15,887 --> 0:9:19,967
get back in bed and shut the hell up!


162
0:9:19,967 --> 0:9:26,847
- No one talks to me that way.
- Get used to it, missy.


163
0:9:26,847 --> 0:9:30,367
l didn't mean to be
such a hard ass, just now.


164
0:9:30,367 --> 0:9:33,527
You can wait until l'm gone
to put your gown back on.


165
0:9:33,527 --> 0:9:41,847
- Take off your pants.
- Yes, ma'am.


166
0:9:41,847 --> 0:9:44,487
l know it's tough
leaving your mother at home.


167
0:9:44,487 --> 0:9:47,167
- l'm really glad you're here.
- You are?


168
0:9:47,167 --> 0:9:49,407
Yes, l am.


169
0:9:49,407 --> 0:9:53,47
And l promise l'm going
to make it worth your while.


170
0:9:53,47 --> 0:9:55,767
We've already slept together.


171
0:9:55,767 --> 0:9:58,407
You should be careful
about the build-up.


172
0:9:58,407 --> 0:10:2,407
- ls that necessary?
- Yeah.


173
0:10:2,407 --> 0:10:5,487
l got something for you.


174
0:10:5,487 --> 0:10:16,367
You want to hear it?


175
0:10:16,367 --> 0:10:18,807
Did you learn that for me?


176
0:10:18,807 --> 0:10:26,767
More.


177
0:10:26,767 --> 0:10:29,927
<i>The start of a relationship</i>
<i>is about three things,</i>


178
0:10:29,927 --> 0:10:31,727
<i>Control,</i>


179
0:10:31,727 --> 0:10:34,47
Oh, God!


180
0:10:34,47 --> 0:10:35,567
<i>Dependence,</i>


181
0:10:35,567 --> 0:10:39,7

a couple of hours ago.

0:10:39,7 --> 0:10:41,47
<i>And timing,</i>


183
0:10:41,47 --> 0:10:43,47
Your mother broke her leg.

<i>Other than that</i>
<i>there aren't a lot of surprises,</i>

0:10:45,927 --> 0:10:47,687
Dr Cox have you met...?


186
0:10:47,687 --> 0:10:51,447
You don't have
to introduce me to my ex-wife.


187
0:10:51,447 --> 0:10:54,927
Surprise!


188
0:10:54,927 --> 0:11:0,87
You putz.


189
0:11:0,87 --> 0:11:2,607
- <i>Oh no,</i>
- Hello, Jordan.


190
0:11:2,607 --> 0:11:4,527
- <i>Oh no no,</i>
- Perry.


191
0:11:4,527 --> 0:11:7,87
- Perry?
- You never heard that.


192
0:11:7,87 --> 0:11:9,847
<i>And I don't have your ex-wife's</i>
<i>bite mark on my neck,</i>


193
0:11:9,847 --> 0:11:12,887
Don't look her in the eyes.
She'll steal your soul.


194
0:11:12,887 --> 0:11:15,167
How are things down in the underworld?


195
0:11:15,167 --> 0:11:19,367
Good. And you?
Still have a rollicking social life?


196
0:11:19,367 --> 0:11:22,527
Since l cut you loose
it's been one big party.


197
0:11:22,527 --> 0:11:28,87
Name some place, other than the
hospital, you've been in the last month.


198
0:11:28,87 --> 0:11:32,687
Five, four, three, two...


199
0:11:32,687 --> 0:11:35,167
My car!


200
0:11:35,167 --> 0:11:39,47
On the way to the... big party.


201
0:11:39,47 --> 0:11:41,127
That must have hurt.


202
0:11:41,127 --> 0:11:43,167
<i>I gotta get out of here,</i>


203
0:11:43,167 --> 0:11:46,847
<i>Anger like this has a way of being</i>
<i>passed on to whoever's closest,</i>


204
0:11:46,847 --> 0:11:50,847
Dr Cox, l know you're suspended but
you're the only one my mother trusts.


205
0:11:50,847 --> 0:11:55,727
Not now!


206
0:11:55,727 --> 0:12:1,127
This is all your fault.


207
0:12:1,127 --> 0:12:3,247
- Turk, can l talk...?
- No. You can't.


208
0:12:3,247 --> 0:12:8,407
That's why they're called
your problems.


209
0:12:8,407 --> 0:12:15,447
Sorry.


210
0:12:15,447 --> 0:12:19,7
Happy Halloween.


211
0:12:19,7 --> 0:12:22,767
That'll teach you not to spy on
people during their alone time.


212
0:12:22,767 --> 0:12:26,927
<i>When dealing with a crisis everyone</i>
<i>knows you go right to the source,</i>


213
0:12:26,927 --> 0:12:28,727
<i>God the source is pretty,</i>


214
0:12:28,727 --> 0:12:30,487
Ms Sullivan?


215
0:12:30,487 --> 0:12:32,167
Excuse me?


216
0:12:32,167 --> 0:12:34,447
l think we're way past Ms Sullivan.


217
0:12:34,447 --> 0:12:39,847
OK, Jordan...


218
0:12:39,847 --> 0:12:43,647
l don't think
we should see each other again.


219
0:12:43,647 --> 0:12:48,607
The story of my life. Any time l let
my guard down just a little, l get hurt.


220
0:12:48,607 --> 0:12:50,687
l am so sorry.


221
0:12:50,687 --> 0:12:54,127
You know how long it's been
since l connected with someone?


222
0:12:54,127 --> 0:12:57,767
lt's not fair that because of him,
l don't get to spend time...


223
0:12:57,767 --> 0:12:59,847
lt's hard to keep that going.


224
0:12:59,847 --> 0:13:6,887
See you, DJ, l got a date.
''See each other again!''


225
0:13:6,887 --> 0:13:9,367
She's gonna be OK.


226
0:13:9,367 --> 0:13:12,887
l don't know, Mom,
l'm just feeling lost.


227
0:13:12,887 --> 0:13:19,247
Everyone here is so busy,
and l guess l'm just kind of lonely.


228
0:13:19,247 --> 0:13:24,727
Could you just try to hear
what l'm saying? Just this once?


229
0:13:24,727 --> 0:13:27,567
No, l don't have short hair.


230
0:13:27,567 --> 0:13:31,567
Yes, l know short hair
gives me pig-face.


231
0:13:31,567 --> 0:13:34,47
Yeah.


232
0:13:34,47 --> 0:13:35,447
- Dr Cox!
- OK, Linus.


233
0:13:35,447 --> 0:13:39,687
You're too excited. Get your blankie,
go in a corner, and take a time-out.


234
0:13:39,687 --> 0:13:43,367
Non-displaced femoral fracture,
Carla's mom's gonna be fine.


235
0:13:43,367 --> 0:13:45,127
- OK, what?
- Your ex-wife.


236
0:13:45,127 --> 0:13:48,687
- She's the answer.
- Things That Ruined My Life?


237
0:13:48,687 --> 0:13:51,127
Things With Sharp Edges?


238
0:13:51,127 --> 0:13:55,127
She's on the board.
l'm sure she's a reasonable person.


239
0:13:55,127 --> 0:13:57,527
Not that l know her
or have been alone with her.


240
0:13:57,527 --> 0:13:59,87
- But if you just...
- No.


241
0:13:59,87 --> 0:14:1,247
- Ask.
- l'm going to go and do this


242
0:14:1,247 --> 0:14:4,247
as slowly as possible
so you don't misunderstand.


243
0:14:4,247 --> 0:14:7,87
No...


244
0:14:7,87 --> 0:14:10,7
<i>I wonder if he wants me to ask her,</i>


245
0:14:10,7 --> 0:14:15,167
Fine, l'll ask her.


246
0:14:15,167 --> 0:14:19,687
<i>That's a no,</i>


247
0:14:19,687 --> 0:14:22,687
- lt's always funny.
- Can't believe she's sleeping.


248
0:14:22,687 --> 0:14:24,567
She's had two Valium.


249
0:14:24,567 --> 0:14:28,207
- Why, was she in a lot of pain?
- No, she just wouldn't shut up.


250
0:14:28,207 --> 0:14:30,327
l'm sorry.


251
0:14:30,327 --> 0:14:33,527
l notice your little boyfriend's
name's not on the cast.


252
0:14:33,527 --> 0:14:36,287
Making me leave her alone like that?


253
0:14:36,287 --> 0:14:40,847
She would have gotten hurt,
whether you were there or not.


254
0:14:40,847 --> 0:14:42,927
She fell in the shower.


255
0:14:42,927 --> 0:14:46,767
So unless you have an extremely
disturbing relationship,


256
0:14:46,767 --> 0:14:50,247
- l'm afraid you're full of crap.
- l'm full of crap?


257
0:14:50,247 --> 0:14:53,407
lf you don't care about being
suspended, why are you here?


258
0:14:53,407 --> 0:14:56,447
You don't scare me
with those crazy eyes.


259
0:14:56,447 --> 0:14:58,887
She's an excuse to not take chances.


260
0:14:58,887 --> 0:15:2,487
- You're only happy when you're here.
- You're afraid to live your own life.


261
0:15:2,487 --> 0:15:5,367
Admit that losing this place
would kill you.


262
0:15:5,367 --> 0:15:13,287
- We done?
- That's all l got.


263
0:15:13,287 --> 0:15:16,367
Crazy eyes?


264
0:15:16,367 --> 0:15:18,327
Low blow.


265
0:15:18,327 --> 0:15:20,847
<i>There are other ways</i>
<i>to save Dr Cox's job,</i>


266
0:15:20,847 --> 0:15:26,367
<i>I could try talking to Dr Kelso,</i>


267
0:15:26,367 --> 0:15:30,207
<i>Cox could get plastic surgery</i>
<i>to look like Jimmie Walker,</i>


268
0:15:30,207 --> 0:15:33,247
This guy's gonna need 30mEqs of KCL.


269
0:15:33,247 --> 0:15:36,447
<i>Or I could just ask Jimmie Walker</i>
<i>to talk to Dr Kelso,</i>


270
0:15:36,447 --> 0:15:41,367
Your man Cox is the best. l know he's
got an unorthodox way of doing things,


271
0:15:41,367 --> 0:15:43,407
but all the innovators do.


272
0:15:43,407 --> 0:15:46,7
Now, everybody deserves
a second chance.


273
0:15:46,7 --> 0:15:48,687
Am l right?


274
0:15:48,687 --> 0:15:50,767
Who are you?


275
0:15:50,767 --> 0:15:56,567
<i>Or I could get back</i>
<i>to the problem at hand,</i>


276
0:15:56,567 --> 0:15:59,47
l know you're on your way
to the board meeting


277
0:15:59,47 --> 0:16:1,607
and l know
you don't really like me, but...


278
0:16:1,607 --> 0:16:3,687
l don't dislike you. l nothing you.


279
0:16:3,687 --> 0:16:7,367
Thanks, that's special.
l have to ask you a favour.


280
0:16:7,367 --> 0:16:9,847
But this is not why we slept together.


281
0:16:9,847 --> 0:16:13,247
You had nothing to do
with why we slept together.


282
0:16:13,247 --> 0:16:16,487
l think we both know
that's not completely true.


283
0:16:16,487 --> 0:16:20,407
Even though you're terrified
Dr Cox will find out,


284
0:16:20,407 --> 0:16:24,7
if l wanted you to have sex with me
in front of him, you would.


285
0:16:24,7 --> 0:16:25,967
Please don't do that.


286
0:16:25,967 --> 0:16:29,127
You remind me of him
when he was younger.


287
0:16:29,127 --> 0:16:31,207
Then see if you can dig up sympathy


288
0:16:31,207 --> 0:16:36,887
for someone who means a whole lot to me,
and probably means a little to you, too.


289
0:16:36,887 --> 0:16:39,927
- So will you help him?
- Ah, sweetie...


290
0:16:39,927 --> 0:16:42,247
No.


291
0:16:42,247 --> 0:16:45,167
- l went to therapy once.
- You did?


292
0:16:45,167 --> 0:16:49,687
Yeah. Once though,
like, back in '93 to '94.


293
0:16:49,687 --> 0:16:51,687
Then a few months in '95.


294
0:16:51,687 --> 0:16:54,687
And then l went to group,
which was a disaster.


295
0:16:54,687 --> 0:16:58,527
When l went to college it was
my first time away from home.


296
0:16:58,527 --> 0:17:1,527
Things started piling up
and l felt l was sinking.


297
0:17:1,527 --> 0:17:4,447
- Yeah.
- And no matter how embarrassing


298
0:17:4,447 --> 0:17:8,287
you think it might be, it's always
helpful to talk to someone neutral.


299
0:17:8,287 --> 0:17:11,567
For example, take a look at me.
l am now, thanks to therapy,


300
0:17:11,567 --> 0:17:14,327
in a healthy relationship
with a beautiful woman,


301
0:17:14,327 --> 0:17:20,47
who won't sleep over because
she thinks l broke her mother's leg.


302
0:17:20,47 --> 0:17:24,287
Baby!


303
0:17:24,287 --> 0:17:26,887
How long were you back there?
For a second, huh?


304
0:17:26,887 --> 0:17:29,687
- l wasn't talking about us...
- Turk.


305
0:17:29,687 --> 0:17:33,767
Mom's spending the night here,
so l will spend the night with you,


306
0:17:33,767 --> 0:17:37,887
only we have to leave right now.


307
0:17:37,887 --> 0:17:49,87
Go.


308
0:17:49,87 --> 0:17:52,367
<i>Sometimes no matter how badly</i>
<i>you want to stop something</i>


309
0:17:52,367 --> 0:17:54,687
<i>there's nothing you can do to stop it,</i>


310
0:17:54,687 --> 0:17:57,47
<i>The board of directors</i>
<i>of Sacred Heart</i>


311
0:17:57,47 --> 0:18:2,327
<i>is behind that door sipping water</i>
<i>and killing the career of Dr Cox,</i>


312
0:18:2,327 --> 0:18:5,247
Yes. l am bullet-proof.


313
0:18:5,247 --> 0:18:9,327
- <i>He's taking it well,</i>
- So, no hard feelings?


314
0:18:9,327 --> 0:18:12,407
- Careful.
- Catch you on the flip side.


315
0:18:12,407 --> 0:18:15,687
l really think
you're making a big mistake.


316
0:18:15,687 --> 0:18:19,207
- The most destructive thing about Dr...
- Yawn!


317
0:18:19,207 --> 0:18:25,47
l say yawn because when l actually yawn,
you don't get it.


318
0:18:25,47 --> 0:18:26,807
See you in hell.


319
0:18:26,807 --> 0:18:29,327
<i>I don't know why she did it</i>
<i>maybe I got to her,</i>


320
0:18:29,327 --> 0:18:31,927
<i>Maybe she knows how much</i>
<i>the hospital needs him,</i>


321
0:18:31,927 --> 0:18:35,127
<i>Maybe she remembers why</i>
<i>she cared about him in the first place,</i>


322
0:18:35,127 --> 0:18:38,887
l did it cos the thought of you
rotting here in this fluorescent tomb


323
0:18:38,887 --> 0:18:42,967
is more fun than tipping a valet
with your alimony cheque.


324
0:18:42,967 --> 0:18:47,407
Listen, pumpkin, if you're having
this much trouble getting over me,


325
0:18:47,407 --> 0:18:49,607
just go ahead and give me a call,


326
0:18:49,607 --> 0:18:52,567
and l'll toss you
a sympathy throw-down any time.


327
0:18:52,567 --> 0:19:1,607
<i>It made me realise</i>
<i>every ending leads to new complications,</i>


328
0:19:1,607 --> 0:19:6,407
<i>New problems to be dealt with,</i>


329
0:19:6,407 --> 0:19:11,127
l'm watching that.


330
0:19:11,127 --> 0:19:17,7
- <i>New issues,</i>
- Thanks, Dr Greenberg.


331
0:19:17,7 --> 0:20:1,367
See you next week.


332
0:20:1,367 --> 0:20:5,167
- She was never boring.
- What happened?


333
0:20:5,167 --> 0:20:10,207
You marry somebody like your mother
then remember you hate your mother.


334
0:20:10,207 --> 0:20:13,327
You asked her for help, didn't you?


335
0:20:13,327 --> 0:20:16,647
You don't realise how important
you are around here.


336
0:20:16,647 --> 0:20:20,407
<i>I'll always remember that as</i>
<i>the first thank-you I got from Dr Cox,</i>


337
0:20:20,407 --> 0:20:24,927
Jeez, Agnes. Does the field-hockey team
know that you're missing?


338
0:20:24,927 --> 0:20:26,367
<i>It felt good,</i>


339
0:20:26,367 --> 0:20:31,927
Although it did take
some stones to be honest.


340
0:20:31,927 --> 0:20:38,327
Stick with the truth and you can't
get hurt. Always been my philosophy.


341
0:20:38,327 --> 0:20:42,607
- You didn't sleep with her, did you?
- God, no.


342
0:20:42,607 --> 0:22:42,607
<i>Philosophy is tricky,</i>
