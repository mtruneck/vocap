###13 MALE SPEAKER: Good afternoon.
###14 I hope everyone is having a wonderful Big Tent Conference.
###19 We do this because we care a lot about information.
###24 We care exactly for the same reasons you do, because of the
###27 impact that it can have.
###29 
###31 I think about what these devices represent.
###36 When I look at this, I say to myself, Oh my God.
###41 This device is really a small supercomputer.
###44 And this is a slightly larger supercomputer, all connected
###47 over this fast network to these powerful servers.
###51 But then I realize that this is just really the beginning
###55 of something much, much bigger.
###58 And the numbers tell the story.
###61 There are now 1.3 million activations of
###64 Android devices per day.
###68 And that number has doubled in the last six months.
###71 A little bit of math will tell you that we're on our way to
###73 more than a billion or so of these kinds of devices pretty
###77 soon, there are more than a half a billion now.
###80 And of course everyone's waiting for the announcement
###81 of the major competitor on Friday.
###85 And everyone's very excited about that, which is
###86 wonderful--
###87 another great competitor, a smaller percentage than we
###90 have at this point.
###92 The fact of the matter is that both these platforms are
###94 completely changing everything we do, the way we live, the
###99 way we operate in so many ways.
###102 It would never have occurred to me in all my years of doing
###105 this sort of thing that you'd have start-ups that would all
###108 be about what people want, what information they want,
###112 how to meet other people, where they should go, what
###114 they should do, how they should entertain themselves.
###116 But not only are those start-ups being formed,
###118 especially here in New York, but they're going to be
###120 successful because of the sheer logic of numbers.
###124 But even more interesting is to imagine what's going to be
###130 possible with these devices over the next few years.
###135 Imagine these not just as pieces of hardware but as
###139 ecosystems.
###140 Ecosystems that are highly personal that you've opted
###144 into, so you've let us know these things, where we can
###146 help give you advice.
###148 They serve as your assistant.
###150 They suggest things.
###152 This is all in the works.
###154 So now imagine a few steps farther.
###160 What does the future look like?
###162 This is not the end.
###163 This is the beginning.
###165 And this is where it gets particularly interesting.
###168 All of us have been trapped in this model, the traditional PC
###172 model of everything right there.
###175 The most interesting thing about computers is that they
###178 almost disappear because they become so commonplace.
###183 I'll give you a scenario.
###185 When you wake up in the morning, the room is alive.
###189 And the room knows roughly how to wake you at the optimal
###193 point in your REM cycle.
###194 It knows what you need in the morning and it alerts you
###197 through complex and powerful screens the things that you
###200 care about, so that you know whether you have a crisis
###203 today or whether you can relax and stay in bed for a while.
###207 Pretty straightforward.
###209 What's interesting about this new world
###211 is that these devices--
###213 again all opt-in, all in ways that you've set up--
###217 help you every day along the way.
###220 Not only do they measure your heart rate and how you're
###223 doing, but they also make your life so much more efficient.
###227 How much time do you spend, wasting, making travel
###232 reservations, trying to figure out where the bus is, how do I
###234 get from here to there, and so forth.
###236 They anticipate what you need, where you're going, because of
###241 the things that you have told it, the things that
###244 it thinks you want.
###245 And all of a sudden you begin to realize it's not just an
###248 assistant, it's really a very smart assistant.
###252 Now as these devices get stronger and as they become
###255 more capable, they can do other things.
###259 Now there's no better example of this than in medicine.
###264 The app that I want, I call, Where's My Mom.
###269 Many people have elderly parents.
###273 I want computers to help monitor how my mom's doing.
###277 How was her day?
###278 Is she good?
###278 Is she bad?
###280 In case there's some alert or something that she needs.
###283 The good news is she's in good health but you never know.
###286 Why can't we do that?
###287 Well, in fact people are building those
###289 devices right now.
###290 But now let's go one step further.
###293 Eventually over the next decade, you'll be able to
###297 actually have things that you ingest, it will transmit
###301 through WiFi, it will say what's going on inside of you.
###307 You can decide if you want to do this or not.
###309 But trust me, your health will be better.
###310 You guys don't look like you're very happy about this.
###313 But people are developing this stuff now.
###316 What about transdermal measurement?
###319 These are devices--
###320 you hold your phone and again without pricking your skin, it
###323 can measure your blood pressure, your various other
###326 vital signs, and so forth.
###328 We're going to build the systems so the doctor calls
###332 you and says, you better get yourself to the hospital right
###335 now, rather than you calling the doctor.
###339 And that's the ultimate inversion of this model, that
###343 these devices, that the micro-miniaturization, the
###345 technology that we've taken that's been so heavy and hard
###349 to use for most of us becomes embedded inside of us.
###353 There's a new generation of technology, social robots,
###356 that can actually recognize gestures and can actually
###359 interact, all of which will be put to the service of us.
###365 So when you think about this from an art perspective and a
###368 culture perspective, it says that these devices, which
###373 we're so incredibly excited about, will be seen as so
###376 extraordinarily primitive.
###379 And that the ability to build systems that interact, that
###384 help us, that monitor us-- again because
###387 we want them to--
###389 will make a huge, huge difference
###392 in everybody's lives.
###393 And the most exciting thing about this is that in the
###396 spread of this, it happens not just for us, the wealthy,
###403 developed world.
###404 But the same story at a slower scale works in
###408 the developing world.
###410 So we sit there and we go, well, we're really excited.
###413 We can use Google here.
###414 We can watch YouTube and so forth.
###416 In a country with no schools, no textbooks, and the only
###421 thing they have are these devices, these devices are
###424 life-changing.
###426 And over the next three to five years, the next five
###430 billion will get low-end smartphones
###432 of one kind or another.
###434 It will finally enable them to join our conversation, to get
###439 the benefits of the information, the culture, the
###442 art, and all the things that you all have worked so hard.
###446 It's extraordinary to imagine all of the world now being
###449 able to participate at the state of the art, at the level
###452 of technology that we're talking about today.
###456 This is I think why we're so excited about our partnerships
###458 with you all and why we're putting so much money in this
###461 kind of stuff.
###462 I thought what I should do is pause and perhaps ask people's
###465 comments or questions as we begin
###469 the rest of the afternoon.
###470 Who would like to start with questions or comments on this
###472 or on anything else?
###474 
###478 In the back, go ahead, yes sir.
###480 AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
###481 
###497 what in the future the individual's responsibility
###500 for themselves will be or could be?
###503 And how does that change in our relationship to larger
###506 corporations who would have to run these systems?
###508 
###510 MALE SPEAKER: Very good question.
###513 The technology can be programmed to be more of a
###516 nanny state or more of a libertarian model, for
###519 purposes of discussion, if you want to imagine
###523 the two most extremes.
###525 I believe societies will ultimately choose somewhere
###528 along that arc.
###531 And I think societies will choose different points based
###534 on culture, legal precedent, sort of the way they run.
###539 Autocracies, for example, will be much less interested in
###543 your personal freedom than a
###544 democracy, for obvious reasons.
###546 And there's lots of evidence of that.
###550 That's the first observation.
###552 It will vary.
###553 
###556 All of these systems, in my view, will ultimately be
###558 designed around, the individual has to opt in.
###563 It's simply too scary to imagine these things being
###566 imposed on people, I argue and I feel very strongly that in
###571 the hawks versus doves argument, the hawks tend to
###575 win and there tends to be a stripping of privacy.
###579 There tends to be a loss of individual responsibility, if
###583 you will, the ability to make your own choice.
###585 But I do think that societies will make those decisions but
###589 in different levels.
###591 And the technology will serve that.
###594 The second part of your question was, what are the
###595 responsibilities of global companies?
###597 We spend a lot of time at Google thinking about this.
###600 And the conclusion we've come to, is we have a set of
###603 principles that we believe in to make the
###605 world a better place.
###607 And we will push them as hard as we can up to the point
###611 where we're violating the laws of the other country.
###614 So we will take a position-- when there's an ambiguity--
###617 for free expression, openness, freedom of
###620 choice, we trust you.
###623 When it comes to literally violating the law of the other
###627 country, then we're forced to back away, sometimes in our
###632 view for the wrong reasons.
###635 Most global companies will come to that.
###638 Our attitude is seen in many
###640 countries is American hegemony.
###643 It's important to understand that my message, which plays
###645 well in the US, does not necessarily play
###647 well in other countries.
###650 More questions?
###651 Yes, yes, ma'am.
###652 
###661 AUDIENCE: What I brought up before about market
###662 saturation, I'd like to hear your thoughts on making the
###667 availability of any kind of a creative work, whether it's a
###672 newspaper, a work of art, but making it available so broadly
###677 that it therefore saturates a market, which tends to push
###683 pricing down.
###685 Which tends to then support industries as a whole but not
###692 the smaller company, not the smaller individual.
###696 And is that where we're going?
###699 Where it becomes almost like the old motion picture studio
###702 model for all creative works?
###704 And that that's the only way to make money is if the
###707 companies own all of this, because of this market
###710 saturation.
###711 MALE SPEAKER: I agree with the first half of your question
###712 and not the conclusion.
###715 So the rough analysis of what's going on is that we
###718 went from an era of scarcity to an era of abundance.
###722 That the distribution models of the past were largely
###725 limited by physical constraints, the difficulty of
###729 copying et cetera, et cetera.
###732 So you had high cost of distribution, high cost of
###734 manufacturing.
###735 In the digital world, you have essentially no cost of
###737 distribution and no cost of manufacturing.
###740 So you've gone from the era of scarcity
###742 to the era of abundance.
###744 In an era of abundance, there are many, many strategies to
###747 make money.
###748 Unfortunately, the people who made the money in the era of
###752 scarcity often don't make the transition to the next.
###755 They struggle for all sorts of reasons.
###758 In the newspapers--
###759 which is an easy one to understand--
###761 there are number of newspapers that were formed that are new
###764 that are doing very well, that adopted an advertising model
###767 as opposed to a subscription model.
###769 The Politico and Huffington Post, as to Huffington Post
###772 run out of here.
###774 And so those are some examples of new ventures, new business
###778 models where they ditched the old model.
###781 And it's fine to keep the old model but the point is, it's a
###784 hybrid model.
###785 So it does not then follow that all the content is owned
###790 by big companies.
###792 I think what it means is that at each point in the value
###795 chain of distribution, you have to come up with a
###798 strategy to build an audience that will get you enough
###800 market that you can monetize it.
###803 The old model of hey, I'm going to restrict access to my
###806 content works if you have something which you can get
###810 the subscription revenue for.
###812 It doesn't generally work in a world where everything's so
###814 easily copyable.
###816 That's where we are.
###817 A lot of people are struggling with this.
###820 We do have a lot of very good examples now.
###822 If you look at YouTube, classic example.
###826 The major studios took years to get to the point where they
###830 were comfortable putting their content on YouTube.
###832 And now we've pretty much got partners with every single one
###835 of them and pretty much every one of those
###836 deals making money.
###838 So we together with them figured out a way to monetize
###841 that content in a new way.
###842 Just took a while.
###843 AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
###844 
###848 MALE SPEAKER: The question is, does it go to the companies
###850 rather than the individual creators?
###852 The logic would be the inverse because the networks should
###856 disintermediate the middle man and the aggregate revenue
###860 should increase to the content provider at the end state.
###865 So you may be seeing a transition effect or you may
###867 be seeing some aspect of the market doesn't make sense.
###870 But typically the internet
###871 disintermediates the middle people.
###873 And it forces the middle men to become much more highly
###876 verticalized and specialized, because sheer distribution is
###880 no longer an asset.
###881 
###884 Yes, sir, go ahead.
###885 
###889 AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
###890 
###893 is the YouTube film which is [INAUDIBLE]
###894 
###903 MALE SPEAKER: This is not the first time we've had
###906 controversial videos on YouTube.
###908 Our team has reviewed this video very, very carefully.
###912 It's well within the guidelines that we established
###915 in 2008 for what would be permissible on YouTube.
###918 And you can read them on the site, so
###920 there's no secrets here.
###922 So it'll stay up.
###923 We have blocked it in a couple of countries where the law
###928 does not allow it to be shown.
###931 And we have blocked it in two other countries where we
###934 thought it was a matter of public safety.
###936 We don't want to be associated with this violence, of course.
###940 My personal view is that you have internal strife.
###946 The vast majority of people who seem to be engaged in this
###950 bad behavior have not seen the video.
###953 They heard it through oral reports and so forth.
###957 So to argue against keeping the video up is to argue
###962 against core freedom of expression argument.
###966 And I think all of us believe in religious tolerance.
###969 And that includes religious criticism.
###971 And you'll see that our policies.
###973 So we've made the decision to keep it up.
###977 We obviously do not endorse any of those actions or
###980 violence that have consequences.
###982 And frankly, I think, this is going to happen again in other
###986 forms, consequence of the connected world.
###990 The alternative is to shut off the internet, which
###992 [? you're ?] not going to do.
###995 AUDIENCE: I have a question about what the
###998 gentleman was saying.
###1000 You said at some point doctor will call you, you don't need
###1003 to call the doctor.
###1005 Let's assume in a country where it's illegal to be gay.
###1007 You have AIDS.
###1008 Do you want your doctor to call you?
###1010 MALE SPEAKER: This is why I said earlier it's incredibly
###1013 important that these systems be user choice.
###1016 So if you were aware that you're potentially eligible
###1020 for some health disease which is illegal in your crazy and
###1023 stupid country.
###1024 Right?
###1026 If you find yourself stuck in the world's worst country
###1028 which would do that, obviously it's a terrible situation.
###1031 You would appropriately decide not to expose yourself to this
###1036 possible risk.
###1038 There is an issue here that these systems tend naturally
###1042 to be connected and naturally have tracking capabilities
###1045 just because of the way they're built.
###1047 So that's why opt-in, people can turn them on and off, and
###1050 user buy-in are very important.
###1051 
###1054 One more, yes?
###1055 The one there.
###1056 Yes.
###1056 Over here or here.
###1058 Go ahead.
###1058 It doesn't matter.
###1060 Yes. sir.
###1062 AUDIENCE: We've had experience in the age of the internet of
###1067 material not being available anymore and
###1069 storage systems change.
###1071 And there are constant upgrades move faster and
###1076 faster and faster, especially with mobile.
###1078 So that eventually people have to recognize a day may come
###1082 when oh, my photographs, my music, my texts, my novel,
###1088 they disappeared.
###1089 Where are they?
###1090 I think if Ray Bradbury were writing 451 in this day and
###1094 age, it wouldn't be about burning books.
###1096 It would be about pushing a button on a computer somewhere
###1098 and they would all just digitally disappear.
###1101 As our technology progresses, how do we know that we're
###1105 going to be able to retain that from the past as a new
###1109 storage system comes into being?
###1113 MALE SPEAKER: There are whole teams
###1114 looking at this question.
###1115 This is known as the digital archival question.
###1118 I'm not as worried about this because the systems that
###1122 Google and others are building tend to preserve everything in
###1126 a format that is presentable.
###1129 Eventually, I think your argument is correct.
###1132 But, for example, the ubiquity of jpegs and photographs,
###1135 there will always, 100 years from now, be a converter from
###1139 that jpeg format to whatever exists.
###1142 There's simply too much.
###1143 There's too many.
###1145 I don't worry about this issue for things
###1147 which are highly common.
###1149 I do think that if you have a very specialized format, there
###1152 really is danger of losing that.
###1155 And so if you're using the very standardized data
###1158 representation formats, you'll probably be fine.
###1161 And for the specialized stuff, there are people trying to
###1162 figure out archivally keep this, things like the
###1165 Smithsonian and things like that.
###1167 But your your safety in terms of preservation is to use the
###1171 most common formats.
###1173 YouTube's not going to go away, as an example, Uses
###1175 common formats.
###1178 Yes.
###1179 There was a question over here.
###1179 Yes.
###1180 Yes, sir.
###1182 AUDIENCE: I just wanted to ask you about search and curation.
###1186 You talked about five billion more people entering this
###1189 conversation.
###1189 It seems like two things sort of happen.
###1192 One, we all go into an echo chamber and we find the things
###1195 we find over and over again versus being given things.
###1200 As the conversation increases, how are we going to find the
###1202 things that are really important to us?
###1204 MALE SPEAKER: There's been a lot of people who worried that
###1207 the nature of the selection bias and the systems that are
###1210 being built will ultimately produce narrow echo chambers
###1214 where we only hear ourselves and our friends and so forth.
###1218 This has been measured and so far it's completely not true.
###1222 So far, we've managed to escape the outcome of lack of
###1228 criticality.
###1230 And I personally believe that as more voices come in, it's
###1234 good from a standpoint of more choices.
###1237 We would argue that this is a ranking problem.
###1239 How do you-- with all these new voices-- how do you rank
###1242 those voices compared to others?
###1244 We're in the business of ranking.
###1245 It's not perfect but we do the best we can.
###1248 We have time for a couple more.
###1249 Yes, yes.
###1251 AUDIENCE: Good afternoon.
###1252 I want to follow up on your disintermediation point and
###1255 ask if you might envision the technologies that Google
###1260 facilitates development of as an ultimate disruptor,
###1263 possibly eventually disintermediating the need for
###1266 the real estate that cinemas offer for alternate content?
###1269 And that possibly opening up the abilities for a greater
###1273 amount of this artistic alternative content to find
###1276 its way there?
###1277 MALE SPEAKER: I--
###1278 AUDIENCE: Three points to it, just quickly.
###1280 If the [? end cinema ?] is big, democratized in it's
###1283 offering and community, can not those three things and
###1286 more be offered online?
###1288 AUDIENCE: I have a very strong opinion on movie theaters.
###1291 I think that they're incredibly important because
###1293 they're the only places that people turn off
###1295 their mobile devices.
###1296 [AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]
###1298 MALE SPEAKER: No, no think about it.
###1299 Is there any other place in the world?
###1303 You keep it on when you're asleep but not when you're in
###1306 the movie theater.
###1308 This is landmark status.
###1310 [AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]
###1315 MALE SPEAKER: I think going to the movies is a social
###1317 experience, the sense of going to the opening.
###1319 that's not going to go away.
###1321 And so I think the movie folks all believe that you're seeing
###1324 a compression of windows.
###1326 But I think the model will preserve at least the notion
###1329 of opening night.
###1331 People want to feel special.
###1332 It goes back to the question earlier about scarcity.
###1334 
###1337 Very clever marketeers understand that if they make
###1340 slightly fewer of a product and there is demand, it
###1343 creates excessive lines.
###1346 That's what happens in the clubs around here.
###1349 The most popular club is defined as the one with the
###1351 longest line, not the greatest capacity.
###1353 
###1359 We have one final question.
###1361 Right over here.
###1361 Yes.
###1363 
###1367 AUDIENCE: How do you go about educating entire populaces
###1370 about the ins and outs of opting in, when they should do
###1373 it, how they should do it, when they shouldn't do it.
###1377 MALE SPEAKER: First that you start with an awful lot of
###1379 information that's online.
###1381 And you try to make it readable in people's language
###1384 and they can understand it.
###1386 Most people are confused by what's happening because
###1391 they're not computer scientists.
###1392 They don't really understand how this stuff can be used.
###1394 So we've tried very hard to do that.
###1399 I think the reality is that education in general is going
###1402 to change a big deal around the world because you no
###1406 longer need to memorize all the stuff.
###1408 Now you need to have a significant education in being
###1412 an online citizen.
###1414 As a young person, what does it mean to be a tweeter?
###1416 What does it mean to be texting?
###1419 So, for example, all these high school students are
###1421 probably going to be rather surprised to discover all
###1423 those pictures are still around when they're 45.
###1426 And nobody told them that or if their parents told them
###1429 that, they discounted it.
###1430 But if their teachers tell them, maybe they will listen.
###1432 I think there's a whole series of steps that
###1434 society will go through.
###1436 What I will tell you is that the shift from the analog
###1439 world to the digital world that we're going through--
###1442 we're not going back.
###1444 We need to get organized around how we're
###1445 going to run society--
###1447 respectfully, with appropriate levels of privacy, respecting
###1451 the rights of public safety, and sort that out.
###1455 Countries will make those decisions differently.
###1458 And this will be a constant discussion in the media.
###1462 And that's how the education really occurs.
###1466 So with that, Peter, thank you.
###1467 Thank you very much.
###1468 Thank you all.
###1470 And we'll continue.
###1471
