###9 PAUL JAY: Welcome to The Real News Network. I'm Paul Jay in Baltimore. And we're continuing
###12 our discussions with members of LEAP, Law Enforcement Against Prohibition. These are
###17 police officers who believe that the prohibition against drugs is failing and the war on drugs
###24 should be stopped and drugs should be legalized.
###27 Now joining us to talk about this, first of all, is Stephen Downing. Stephen's a retired
###32 deputy chief of police for the Los Angeles Police Department. He was commander of the
###36 Bureau of Special Investigations. One of those divisions was the Administrative Narcotics
###43 Division. Thanks for joining us.
###46 Also joining us is Terry Nelson. Terry's law enforcement career spanned three decades.
###50 It included service in the U.S. Border Patrol, U.S. Customs Service, and the Department of
###55 Homeland Security, taking him beyond the U.S. borders into Mexico, Central America, and
###60 South America. In various capacities he acquired a first-hand knowledge of the war on drugs
###65 through his direct involvement with counternarcotics missions. Thanks very much for joining us.
###69 TERRY NELSON: Thank you for having me.
###70 JAY: So start with your own story. You're a Texan. You told me off-camera you're a Republican.
###79 You grew up with these values (I would have thought) that the war on drugs is a necessity,
###83 and you were involved in fighting it. What is your thinking in the beginning of your
###88 career? And how does that--your experience change that thinking?
###91 NELSON: Well, as a young officer, you think you can make a difference, of course, and
###94 you spend years trying, and then all of a sudden you realize the futility of what you're
###98 doing 'cause you're not making any progress.
###100 I never really turned against the war on drugs until I got into command structure and was
###106 working in Central and South America and saw the total futility of--like, Plan Colombia
###111 was $5.2 billion we spent trying to train the Colombian police and spraying herbicides
###116 on the coca crop. At the end of five years of that program, the coca production went
###122 up 25 percent in Colombia. So either we were spraying fertilizer on it instead of herbicide
###127 or the farmers became much better. And that's what happened. The more successful we were
###133 in destroying the crops, the more successful the farmers were, and they tripled the yield
###136 of the coca plant in about three years. So they made up all the difference and actually
###140 produced 25 percent more cocaine than they had at the beginning of the drug war. You
###144 see this and you know you're not going to arrest your way out of the drug war. Arrest
###148 and incarceration will never work. But education, we believe, will work.
###152 JAY: Okay. So that coin dropped for you, but you're working with other officers. And in
###157 the command structure, do you talk about these things? And what kind of pushback do you get?
###161 NELSON: Well, you talk about it somewhat, but you have to be careful, because everyone
###169 wants to get promoted. That's the whole purpose of going in, to work your way up the chain,
###172 where you can have more influence on what's going on.
###175 I spoke out at an interdiction committee meeting one time with--I called in a triple-PhD from
###180 Washington, D.C., that came down just to tell us how to do the--he was laying out economic
###184 models and said, if we can just destroy this much property, this much coke, we can win
###188 this drug war. And I stood up and said, am I the only SOB in this room that thinks we're
###193 doing this wrong and we should change our strategy? And everybody applauded until I
###198 was called up in front of the room and he stuck his finger in my chest and said, Agent
###201 Nelson, you don't make policy, you carry it out, so you salute smartly and you go back
###205 and sit down [incompr.] Okay. So when I got out of the service, I decided I was going
###210 to help change that policy, because I could do it then.
###212 JAY: Stephen, how about you? You're in tough territory, downtown L.A. Drugs must be one
###219 of the overwhelming things you have to deal with. You must have bought into this idea
###225 that it was necessary.
###226 STEPHEN DOWNING: Well, as a young 22-year-old coming in from a rural community, going into
###234 the academy, you listen to what they tell you and you believe it. And so you buy into--at
###241 that time you were still buying into the residual of Harry Anslinger, who said that blacks and
###247 browns use marijuana and it makes them rape white women. And so a lot of the myth-making
###253 was still alive. And you believe it. You go out on the street.
###258 And in those days, just possession of a tiny amount of marijuana was a felony. Well, a
###264 felony arrest was a big deal for a young police officer. And so you did your job. And in those
###271 days, especially in those days, quota systems were rampant. The measurement of good police
###278 work was not an absence of crime; it was what did your recap look like at the end of the
###285 day. But as you grow and you go through the ranks and you study and you become a manager,
###294 you realize that there are more effective methods for supervising police operations.
###302 And so by the time I was a commander, it was about the same time that President Nixon announced
###308 the war on drugs, and it was also the same time that I had just uncovered at the divisional
###314 level the growth of two small gangs. They were called the Bloods and the Crips. And
###320 they had a membership of less than 100. So our charge--when Nixon announced the war on
###327 drugs, I took over the narcotic effort, narcotic enforcement effort. Our strategy, which was
###335 the national strategy--cut the head off the snake, reduce the flow of drugs into the country,
###341 and reduce drug abuse and drug addiction. Well, as we started, a big deal when we call
###347 the press for our dog-and-pony shows: one or two kilos, a few thousand dollars, a few
###354 handguns. Next month, it's a little more than that. A little more. A little more.
###361 So today you look at it--and there is really no metric--none--that measures success--all
###371 of the metrics say this is a failure. Those two small gangs in the 40 years of this drug
###378 war have grown to 33,000 gangs across the nation with a membership of 1.5 million. When
###387 we started, the cartels were barely heard of. They were somewhere in South America,
###392 Latin America. Two years ago, the DOJ said the cartels control drug trafficking with
###399 the help of the gangs in 250 American cities. This year the DOJ said the drug cartels control
###408 drug trafficking in 1,000 American cities.
###412 So we haven't made a dent in these three strategy approaches. Addiction, drug abuse, it goes
###420 up and down. The flow of drugs is now warehouses full. The guns are tens of thousands of war-level
###434 weapons. And the money, even being laundered by domestic banks, they get a slap on the
###440 hand, there's millions of dollars on pallets.
###444 And cutting the head off the snake, I came to discover as a police executive who likes
###451 to do a good job and likes to meet his goals and effectively execute the strategy, that
###459 was a big thing to me, because I finally decided there's no snake, it's starfish. And when
###466 you cut a starfish in half, you get two starfish. When you cut it four ways, you get four. And
###472 the only way to kill a starfish is to remove its nutrient. And in the case of the cartels
###478 and the gangs, the nutrient is money.
###481 They can't function without money. They can't buy guns, money can't be laundered, and they'll
###486 be out of business. And so prohibition creates their opportunity for money. And if we take
###493 that black market away, we're going to dry 'em up. And that's what I discovered as a
###499 police executive. And that's why I believe that the only way to get out from under this--.
###507 And since I've left the department in the '80s, they just poured more money in, unprecedented
###515 money. They militarized our police. The federal government bought off our police, in effect,
###521 by providing military equipment, by providing grants.
###525 This asset-seizure program, it's evil. It's totally evil. They say they created it to
###532 get the kingpins, but the average seizure's $15,000, and if a guy wants to get his $15,000
###540 car back, he can't hire a lawyer for that kind of money. So all of these things that
###545 go into the harm of people, the discussions about prisons--California in 1980 had a total
###553 prison population of 23,000. Between 1980 and now, we've built 23 prisons, we've hired
###561 thousands of prison guards, we've fired thousands of teachers. Today our prison population is
###567 163,000. Twenty-five thousand of those are nonviolent drug offenders, at $65,000 a piece
###576 a year to keep them in jail. That's $1.52 million.
###581 And this year, we told our 23-campus university system: no more new students. Our community
###588 college student--three weeks ago, demonstrations, 500,000 kids can't get classes. So we're trading
###597 the education of America for a drug war that's just stacking our prisons with cordwood, destroying
###603 families, destroying neighborhoods, unraveling our whole social structure.
###608 JAY: So when colleagues of yours, people you know in law enforcement hear arguments like
###614 this and arguments that you give, I don't understand how they cannot be persuaded. What
###619 is this sort of moral imperative that seems to be deep in American political culture that
###626 you got to fight this war on drugs 'cause somehow it represents the struggle between
###630 good and evil or something?
###632 NELSON: Well, our drug czar recently came out and said that drug abuse is not a moral
###638 failure. So he actually came out and said that. And he also said, we're not going to
###641 arrest our way out of the drug war. The issue is--.
###644 JAY: Who said that?
###645 NELSON: Kerlikowski, the drug czar.
###647 The issue is it's institutionalized. Prison unions fight us all the time. Police unions
###654 fight us because they don't want it legalized, because then they're going to lose membership.
###661 As he mentioned earlier, the police make a tremendous amount of money from the federal
###664 government, not counting--if the police arrest someone at night, a couple of kids for a few
###670 joints, they take them in and arrest them, put them in jail, they go back the next day
###674 for a hearing, they get three hours overtime a piece. It's a money-making machine for them.
###679 They don't want to quit it.
###680 The military-industrial complex does not want it to end, because if you sell a Sikorsky
###685 helicopter to Colombia for $16 million, that's nothing. It's going to cost $100 million a
###689 year to put the maintenance contract in place to keep them flying.
###692 So it's all about the money. In law enforcement, it's all about the Benjamins. You follow the
###696 money trail, you find the problem. And everybody's making money off of the current drug war at
###702 the expense of our children's futures, because when you get arrested for a drug offense,
###709 I don't care if they don't put you in jail; you've got an arrest record. And when you
###712 go to get a job, you check the box, they see you've had an arrest, they look and you had
###716 a drug arrest, you're not going to get hired. You're going to be marginalized the rest of
###720 your life. And that's going to mean you're not going to pay your fair share of the taxes
###723 that you would have earned if you'd have been able to get a decent job. And instead of being--contributing
###729 to your society, you actually are a drain on our society.
###734 And I don't blame the people, other than the fact that they broke the law. They're in a
###737 position they can't get out of. I mean, once you've got the arrest record, that monkey's
###742 on your back the rest of your life. Our saying in LEAP is you can get over an addiction;
###746 you will never get over a conviction, 'cause it follows you throughout your life.
###750 So it's not just a short-term thing. It ruins the people for the next 30, 40 years, breaks
###757 up families. One-point-nine million kids go to bed every night 'cause one of their parents
###761 are in prison. Forty-some-odd percent of the people that go to prison this year will have
###765 had a family member in prison in front of them. And 25 percent of the children or the
###770 kids that will go to prison this year come out of a foster home or an institution.
###774 Well, that tells you right there this is a hamster wheel. We're destroying the very people
###779 that drug policy claims to want to protect, which is our children. We're breaking up families.
###783 They're raised in foster home. They've become--one parent goes to jail, the other parent has
###788 to get a second job. There's no one to monitor the kids. The evil wheel keeps turning. They're
###792 on the street. They're going to get in trouble. We all know that. Kids are going to be kids.
###795 We've got to keep our kids safe until they reach adulthood.
###798 JAY: So some people think that if you legalize, it leads virtually to anarchy. If it's legal,
###806 everyone's going to go out and do drugs or way more people are going to run off and do
###809 drugs, and the place is going to go crazy, and we've got to clamp down on it. I mean,
###813 how do you argue against that?
###814 DOWNING: We legalized alcohol after a horrible 13-year experience where we discovered we
###822 really made some very bad decisions, and that didn't happen. We retune it and we returned
###829 at that time. We passed a constitutional amendment to put it into effect, and we passed a constitutional
###836 amendment to get rid of alcohol prohibition, and we returned the responsibility to the
###844 states, which is provided by our constitution, demanded by our constitution. And all of the
###849 states, gee, they worked things out, they controlled and regulated and set up their
###856 systems, and they served as models for each other, and they would adopt things. So over
###861 time we had regulated and controlled alcohol.
###865 And during the same time, the organized crime syndicates that were born as a result of alcohol
###872 prohibition, they died. We took their nutrients away, like I say, and they died out. Now,
###879 we're always going to have some criminal organizations, but when we announce a war on drugs, zoom--right
###886 back they came. But this time, the bribery is institutionalized. In Capone's day, they
###893 took the brown bag full of money and handed it to the politicians or the policemen. These
###899 days, the money comes through our system and bribes our institutions and our police, especially
###909 because they've militarized our police and they've diverted them away from what I call
###916 the social contract our police officers have with their communities, and that's to protect
###922 them from crimes against person and crimes against property.
###927 A perfect example in Los Angeles two years ago--you might have read about it. The paper
###933 uncovered the fact that the police laboratory was backlogged 3,000 rape kids, a three-year
###941 backlog, meaning that women who have been raped were waiting for their cases to be resolved
###948 because detectives handling their cases did not have laboratory results. So it was a big
###954 [haz@rA], and they scrambled around and they found $10 million and said, we're going to
###959 catch this up.
###960 Well, what nobody really said is: how come they're backlogged? And the reason they're
###966 backlogged is because when a person is arrested with narcotics, that's a body in custody that's
###974 going to show up in court, and they can't show up in court until that narcotic has been
###980 analyzed. And so all this dope arrests, 43 million arrests since 1971 in this country,
###991 those are analyzed in our laboratories. And every time somebody's arrested, the others
###996 are pushed back.
###998 So they cleaned that one up. And this year, now they've got--they're behind by 4,000 fingerprint
###1003 examinations. Fingerprint examinations are coming off of burglaries, they're coming off
###1008 of assaults, they're coming off of robberies, stores. These are the crimes the police are
###1017 supposed to be working with their communities to solve. But at the same time they're making
###1021 all these narcotic arrests, they're angering people in the communities because they're
###1027 jacking the kids up against the walls or sitting them on the sidewalks, they're draping them
###1031 across the hoods of their cars. And 90 percent of those frisks that are going on are all
###1041 about drugs. They're not about the criminal problems. And so pretty soon you don't have
###1048 a community communicating with you, you don't have a community cooperating with you, because
###1054 this drug war has destroyed that cooperation and it's destroyed respect for the professional
###1060 law enforcement.
###1062 JAY: Just quickly, what would you like to see?
###1064 NELSON: I would like to see total legalization of all drugs, which will cure about 80 percent
###1069 of our crime and violence issues. Won't do anything for our drug problem, because that's
###1073 a separate issue, and I believe that's a medical and a social issue that's best handled through
###1077 education and treatment instead of arrest and incarceration.
###1080 JAY: Thanks very much.
###1081 NELSON: Thank you for having us.
###1082 JAY: Thank you very much.
###1083 And thank you for joining us on The Real News Network.
