###14 CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: That was an enthusiastic intro, and credit goes to Ms. Bamer`s (ph)
###24 students for today`s hello. Glad to have all of you, middle and high school students out
###28 there watching as CNN STUDENT NEWS kicks off its Tuesday, November 27th broadcast.
###35 Starting in the U.S. northeast today, we`ve talked about how the recovery from Superstorm
###38 Sandy is going to take a while. There are thousands of people who can`t get back in
###43 their homes, miles of pipes have to be reconnected, mold, as we show you yesterday, has to be
###49 dealt with. And bills.
###50 Everything from cleanup costs to unpaid bills from people who had to evacuate. Those are
###55 piling up. These were few of the issues brought up yesterday, during a state hearing in New
###61 Jersey. Officials there are trying to get a handle on two things : how to pay for reconstruction
###66 efforts and what kinds of plans can be made to better protect the area if another storm
###71 hits.
###71 Meanwhile, New York has gotten $27 million from the federal government to hire about
###77 5,000 unemployed New Yorkers for work on Sandy cleanup projects. The job will be full-time,
###83 but temporary. New York`s governor and New York City`s mayor are asking for more federal
###88 money to make additional repairs in their state.

###92 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Today`s first "Shoutout" goes out to Mr. Weisbeck`s senior government
###97 class at Timber Lake High School in Timber Lake, South Dakota.
###102 Lewis Hamilton, Dario Frachitti and Juan Pablo Montoya are all known for their roles in what?
###109 You know what to do. Are they all involved in auto racing, theater, horse racing or Congress?
###115 You`ve got three seconds, go!
###122 All three of these guys are involved in auto racing. That`s your answer, and that`s your
###129 "Shoutout."
###130 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###132 AZUZ: And you can add Tristan Nunez to that list. At 17 years old, he`s around your age,
###138 he is one of the youngest auto racing champions ever. And what better spokesman against distracted
###144 driving than someone who wants to race cars for a living? Victor Blackwell joins us now
###148 with the tale of two talents: one about a driver, one about somebody who is hoping that
###153 one day, phones and driving will disconnect.
###156 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
###156 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: All right, drivers! Come get in line over here, please!
###161 VICTOR BLACKWELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Race car drivers on a race track. No big surprise.
###165 What might surprise you is that the favorite to win this race is just 17-years old.
###169 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And you have half the field this side, half the field this size.
###175 BLACKWELL: He is Tristan Nunez from Boca Raton, Florida. He started racing go-carts at 13.
###180 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Just do what you know.
###182 BLACKWELL: And then graduated to this at 15, before he was licensed to drive through his
###187 neighborhood.
###188 TRISTAN NUNEZ, TEEN RACECAR DRIVER: My mom and myself actually feel safer driving on
###191 a race track with professional drivers than driving on the regular roads with people who
###195 have no idea what they are doing.
###198 BLACKWELL: He revs up to above 150 miles per hour around this track.
###203 (on camera): At that speed, there can be any little distraction.
###205 NUNEZ: Yes,
###205 BLACKWELL: It can be - and injury could be death.
###208 NUNEZ: Fatal.
###208 BLACKWELL (voice over): Actually, that can happen at any speed.
###212 Before the start of the racing season, a little distraction off the track nearly created a
###216 major problem.
###217 NUNEZ: I was with my mom in the car, and we almost got into accident because she was face
###220 booking, emailing, whatever. Distracted.
###222 DIANE NUNEZ, MOTHER: We almost reared-ended somebody, and he, you know, that`s when we
###226 really - it really hit us, you know, and he is like, mom, you`ve got to put the phone
###230 down.
###230 BLACKWELL: So Tristan and his mom, Diane Nunez had an idea: to inspire other people, especially
###235 young people to put the phone down, by branding his car the "don`t text and drive car."
###241 DIANE NUNEZ: And we put all over the car, and put in on a suit and then put it on the
###244 Web site and just took off.
###246 BLACKWELL (on camera): And you`ve got the bracelet because when they raise up there,
###250 their hand ...
###250 NUNEZ: Their hand ...
###251 BLACKWELL: ... with the phone.
###251 NUNEZ: With the phone, they see it, exactly.
###252 BLACKWELL: Yeah.
###253 NUNEZ: So, I mean - it just serves as a constant reminder not to do it.
###256 BLACKWELL (voice over): Hundreds of teens have pledged to not text and drive, some had
###259 even signed Tristan`s car as part of the pledge.
###263 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It`s just distracting. It`s - you get caught up in another world,
###267 completely separate from what you are trying to do.
###269 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There is not really a lot of teenage race car drivers out there, so
###272 it was - it was definitely good for them to go on to a teenager`s car.
###274 DIANE NUNEZ: I know we are not going to stop it, but at least it`s going to bring more
###278 awareness to people.
###284 BLACKWELL: Tristan was the big winner on this day at Road Atlanta (ph).
###291 NUNEZ: I would be here.
###292 BLACKSTONE: And he tells teens to look up to him. The key to his success on the track
###297 is the same key to staying safe on the road.
###299 NUNEZ: You have to have 100 percent focus, you can`t lose your focus for any - any reason
###304 at all.
###305 (END VIDEOTAPE)
###305 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
###306 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Time for "Shoutout Extra Credit."
###309 What game was invented by James Naismith? Here we go. Was it basketball, Monopoly, Mario
###317 Bros. or American football? Another three seconds on the clock and go.
###324 While teaching phys. ed at a YMCA in 1891, James Naismith invented basketball. That`s
###334 your answer and that`s your Shoutout Extra Credit.
###338 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###340 AZUZ: So James Naismith invented it, Michael Jordan mastered it, Wilt Chamberlain holds
###345 the record for the most point scored in a single NBA game. That`s 100. But as far as
###351 the most point scored in a college game- go, that record has stood at 113 sine 1954. At
###358 least until this sophomore dunked it. His name is Jack Taylor (ph). He goes to Grinell
###364 College in Iowa. He`s 5 feet 10, a shooting guard, and he recently had a game that was
###369 so amazing that Kobe Bryant and LeBron James tweeted about it. 138 points. That`s the new
###377 record. That`s what Taylor netted in a single game. CNN Soledad O`Brien spoke to him about
###382 it. How he managed to put up so many points and how that was unusual, even for someone
###387 as talented as Taylor.
###388 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
###389 SOLEDAD O`BRIEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: I guess, congratulations first are in order. You were
###393 averaging roughly 23 points per game before the big game. What do you think happened that
###399 day?
###399 JACK TAYLOR, GRINELL COLLEGE BASKETBALL PLAYER: Yeah. I think it was - I think it was kind
###403 of once in a lifetime thing to happen. Coming into the game, I knew I was going to get more
###409 shots than usual. But I definitely hit more shots than I though that I would and at half
###416 time I had 58. My team and coaches kind of gathered around me and we were going to get
###422 me the ball every time down the floor. So, this record won`t be possible without my unselfish
###429 teammates.
###429 O`BRIEN: You know, it`s interesting, because some people give me a little flack about the
###432 selfishness thing. Stuart Scott On ESPN said this: "Not a big fan of Jack Taylor`s 138-point
###440 in Grinell win. He took 108 shots, including 71 3`s. Just say that out loud. Now say "team"!
###446 He`s basically insinuating that you were - were a ball hog, how do you respond to that?
###453 TAYLOR: Yeah, I mean I definitely was a ball hog ...
###456 (laughter)
###457 TAYLOR: But my teammates kept getting me the ball. When I would pass it off to them, they
###465 were trying to get me the ball right back, because they knew I was hot.
###469 And in the second half, we started going for the record when - when my shots were falling.
###475 So, it was a team effort to get me the ball, and they kept encouraging me to shoot, which
###481 only gave me more confidence.
###483 (END VIDEOTAPE)
###484 AZUZ: You`d need more confidence to attempt a record like that. I don`t think I could
###489 score that much just shooting hoops on my own.
###491 So, 138 points is 138 points, or is it?
###495 There is no disputing what Taylor score, but as you just heard, some people do dispute
###500 whether he should be recognized for how he did it.
###503 On out blog at CNNSTUDENTNEWS.COM we are talking about this. We`d love to hear your opinion
###508 on whether Taylor was a ball hog or a basketball star?
###512 Please, on that blog, it`s first names only, please include only your first name.
###517 Before we go, we`ve got some interesting images for you of Santas getting in shape. It`s the
###523 Santa Claus festival in Sydney, Australia where it`s actually summer now, so St. Nick
###527 could show off his lack of a tan. The run benefited children in need, it`s called a
###532 Claus for a Cause, and some, as you just saw, swapped the sleigh for skis. Fireworks tried
###538 to outshine the Rudolph, one Santa used a water jetpack to do that. Launching the rocket
###545 that smacked into and then lit up this massive Christmas Tree. You could say it was sheer
###551 Santamonium, an incomparable Santabration, a seriously Santalizing scheme to set the
###557 stage for the Christmas season. The advent of this puns can leave you in a holi-daze.
###562 So we are just going to wish you a merry Tuesday. Look forward to bringing more news down the
###566 chimney tomorrow. For CNN STUDENT NEWS, I`m Carl Azuz.
