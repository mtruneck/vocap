0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:0,38



2
0:0:0,38 --> 0:0:2,48
In the last video we learned
a little bit about


3
0:0:2,48 --> 0:0:4,13
photosynthesis.


4
0:0:4,13 --> 0:0:6,8
And we know in very general
terms, it's the process where


5
0:0:6,8 --> 0:0:12,58
we start off with photons and
water and carbon dioxide, and


6
0:0:12,58 --> 0:0:16,219
we use that energy in the
photons to fix the carbon.


7
0:0:16,219 --> 0:0:20,68
And now, this idea of carbon
fixation is essentially taking


8
0:0:20,68 --> 0:0:24,39
carbon in the gaseous form, in
this case carbon dioxide, and


9
0:0:24,39 --> 0:0:26,53
fixing it into a solid
structure.


10
0:0:26,53 --> 0:0:30,2
And that solid structure we fix
it into is a carbohydrate.


11
0:0:30,2 --> 0:0:33,39
The first end-product of
photosynthesis was this


12
0:0:33,39 --> 0:0:36,83
3-carbon chain, this
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.


13
0:0:36,83 --> 0:0:40,88
But then you can use that to
build up glucose or any other


14
0:0:40,88 --> 0:0:42,4
carbohydrate.


15
0:0:42,4 --> 0:0:45,63
So, with that said, let's try to
dig a little bit deeper and


16
0:0:45,63 --> 0:0:48,71
understand what's actually going
on in these stages of


17
0:0:48,71 --> 0:0:49,43
photosynthesis.


18
0:0:49,43 --> 0:0:50,92
Remember, we said there's
two stages.


19
0:0:50,92 --> 0:0:54,2
The light-dependent reactions
and then you have the light


20
0:0:54,2 --> 0:0:55,16
independent reactions.


21
0:0:55,16 --> 0:0:57,37
I don't like using the word
dark reaction because it


22
0:0:57,37 --> 0:0:59,6
actually occurs while
the sun is outside.


23
0:0:59,6 --> 0:1:1,1
It's actually occurring
simultaneously


24
0:1:1,1 --> 0:1:2,3
with the light reactions.


25
0:1:2,3 --> 0:1:5,16
It just doesn't need the
photons from the sun.


26
0:1:5,16 --> 0:1:8,27
But let's focus first on the
light-dependent reactions.


27
0:1:8,27 --> 0:1:12,66
The part that actually uses
photons from the sun.


28
0:1:12,66 --> 0:1:16,9
Or actually, I guess, even
photons from the heat lamp


29
0:1:16,9 --> 0:1:19,1
that you might have in
your greenhouse.


30
0:1:19,1 --> 0:1:23,5
And uses those photons in
conjunction with water to


31
0:1:23,5 --> 0:1:35,36
produce ATP and reduce
NADP plus to NADPH.


32
0:1:35,36 --> 0:1:40,7
Remember, reduction is gaining
electrons or hydrogen atoms.


33
0:1:40,7 --> 0:1:42,3
And it's the same thing,
because when you gain a


34
0:1:42,3 --> 0:1:45,27
hydrogen atom, including its
electron, since hydrogen is


35
0:1:45,27 --> 0:1:48,17
not too electronegative, you
get to hog its electron.


36
0:1:48,17 --> 0:1:51,82
So this is both gaining a
hydrogen and gaining electron.


37
0:1:51,82 --> 0:1:53,8
But let's study it a
little bit more.


38
0:1:53,8 --> 0:1:56,66
So before we dig a little
deeper, I think it's good to


39
0:1:56,66 --> 0:1:59,75
know a little bit about the
anatomy of a plant.


40
0:1:59,75 --> 0:2:3,51
So let me draw some
plant cells.


41
0:2:3,51 --> 0:2:6,53
So plant cells actually have
cell walls, so I can draw them


42
0:2:6,53 --> 0:2:8,31
a little bit rigid.


43
0:2:8,31 --> 0:2:11,83
So let's say that these are
plant cells right here.


44
0:2:11,83 --> 0:2:15,29
Each of these squares, each of
these quadrilaterals is a


45
0:2:15,29 --> 0:2:17,28
plant cell.


46
0:2:17,28 --> 0:2:19,89
And then in these plant cells
you have these organelles


47
0:2:19,89 --> 0:2:20,88
called chloroplasts.


48
0:2:20,88 --> 0:2:22,973
Remember organelles are
like organs of a cell.


49
0:2:22,973 --> 0:2:24,23
They are subunits,


50
0:2:24,23 --> 0:2:27,0
membrane-bound subunits of cells.


51
0:2:27,0 --> 0:2:30,3
And of course, these cells have
nucleuses and DNA and all


52
0:2:30,3 --> 0:2:32,44
of the other things you normally
associate with cells.


53
0:2:32,44 --> 0:2:33,44
But I'm not going to
draw them here.


54
0:2:33,44 --> 0:2:35,8
I'm just going to draw
the chloroplasts.


55
0:2:35,8 --> 0:2:40,97
And your average plant cell--
and there are other types of


56
0:2:40,97 --> 0:2:43,68
living organisms that perform
photosynthesis, but we'll


57
0:2:43,68 --> 0:2:44,59
focus on plants.


58
0:2:44,59 --> 0:2:47,95
Because that's what we tend
to associate it with.


59
0:2:47,95 --> 0:2:53,53
Each plant cell will contain
10 to 50 chloroplasts.


60
0:2:53,53 --> 0:2:56,37
I make them green on purpose
because the chloroplasts


61
0:2:56,37 --> 0:2:57,7
contain chlorophyll.


62
0:2:57,7 --> 0:2:59,56
Which to our eyes,
appear green.


63
0:2:59,56 --> 0:3:1,73
But remember, they're green
because they reflect green


64
0:3:1,73 --> 0:3:5,9
light and they absorb red
and blue and other


65
0:3:5,9 --> 0:3:6,4
wavelengths of light.


66
0:3:6,4 --> 0:3:6,86
That's why it looks green.


67
0:3:6,86 --> 0:3:7,6
Because it's reflecting.


68
0:3:7,6 --> 0:3:9,48
But it's absorbing all the
other wavelengths.


69
0:3:9,48 --> 0:3:11,59
But anyway, we'll talk more
about that in detail.


70
0:3:11,59 --> 0:3:16,9
But you'll have 10 to 50 of
these chloroplasts right here.


71
0:3:16,9 --> 0:3:19,93
And then let's zoom in on one
chloroplast. So if we zoom in


72
0:3:19,93 --> 0:3:23,32
on one chloroplast. So
let me be very clear.


73
0:3:23,32 --> 0:3:26,33
This thing right here
is a plant cell.


74
0:3:26,33 --> 0:3:29,88
That is a plant cell.


75
0:3:29,88 --> 0:3:32,42
And then each of these green
things right here is an


76
0:3:32,42 --> 0:3:38,54
organelle called the
chloroplast. And let's zoom in


77
0:3:38,54 --> 0:3:41,99
on the chloroplast itself.


78
0:3:41,99 --> 0:3:46,2
If we zoom in on one
chloroplast, it has a


79
0:3:46,2 --> 0:3:48,58
membrane like that.


80
0:3:48,58 --> 0:3:52,84



81
0:3:52,84 --> 0:3:57,17
And then the fluid inside of the
chloroplast, inside of its


82
0:3:57,17 --> 0:3:59,61
membrane, so this fluid
right here.


83
0:3:59,61 --> 0:4:0,36
All of this fluid.


84
0:4:0,36 --> 0:4:2,43
That's called the stroma.


85
0:4:2,43 --> 0:4:6,0
The stroma of the chloroplast.
And then within the


86
0:4:6,0 --> 0:4:9,52
chloroplast itself, you have
these little stacks of these


87
0:4:9,52 --> 0:4:13,53
folded membranes, These
little folded stacks.


88
0:4:13,53 --> 0:4:16,459
Let me see if I can
do justice here.


89
0:4:16,459 --> 0:4:22,51
So maybe that's one, two,
doing these stacks.


90
0:4:22,51 --> 0:4:25,7
Each of these membrane-bound--
you can almost view them as


91
0:4:25,7 --> 0:4:28,57
pancakes-- let me draw
a couple more.


92
0:4:28,57 --> 0:4:31,97
Maybe we have some over here,
just so you-- maybe you have


93
0:4:31,97 --> 0:4:35,65
some over here, maybe
some over here.


94
0:4:35,65 --> 0:4:38,79
So each of these flattish
looking pancakes right here,


95
0:4:38,79 --> 0:4:40,22
these are called thylakoids.


96
0:4:40,22 --> 0:4:43,32
So this right here
is a thylakoid.


97
0:4:43,32 --> 0:4:44,57
That is a thylakoid.


98
0:4:44,57 --> 0:4:48,0



99
0:4:48,0 --> 0:4:50,9
The thylakoid has a membrane.


100
0:4:50,9 --> 0:4:51,66
And this membrane is especially
important.


101
0:4:51,66 --> 0:4:53,46
We're going to zoom in
on that in a second.


102
0:4:53,46 --> 0:4:57,54
So it has a membrane, I'll color
that in a little bit.


103
0:4:57,54 --> 0:5:1,72
The inside of the thylakoid, so
the space, the fluid inside


104
0:5:1,72 --> 0:5:4,62
of the thylakoid, right
there that area.


105
0:5:4,62 --> 0:5:6,22
This light green color
right there.


106
0:5:6,22 --> 0:5:10,36
That's called the thylakoid
space or the thylakoid lumen.


107
0:5:10,36 --> 0:5:12,96



108
0:5:12,96 --> 0:5:16,53
And just to get all of our
terminology out of the way, a


109
0:5:16,53 --> 0:5:22,9
stack of several thylakoids
just like that,


110
0:5:22,9 --> 0:5:24,63
that is called a grana.


111
0:5:24,63 --> 0:5:27,2
That's a stack of thylakoids.


112
0:5:27,2 --> 0:5:29,84
That is a grana.


113
0:5:29,84 --> 0:5:31,19
And this is an organelle.


114
0:5:31,19 --> 0:5:35,17
And evolutionary biologists,
they believe that organelles


115
0:5:35,17 --> 0:5:38,25
were once independent
organisms that then,


116
0:5:38,25 --> 0:5:41,9
essentially, teamed up with
other organisms and started


117
0:5:41,9 --> 0:5:42,35
living inside of their cells.


118
0:5:42,35 --> 0:5:45,45
So there's actually, they
have their own DNA.


119
0:5:45,45 --> 0:5:48,46
So mitochondria is another
example of an organelle that


120
0:5:48,46 --> 0:5:51,48
people believe that one time
mitochondria, or the ancestors


121
0:5:51,48 --> 0:5:53,96
of mitochondria, were
independent organisms. That


122
0:5:53,96 --> 0:5:56,32
then teamed up with other cells
and said, hey, if I


123
0:5:56,32 --> 0:5:58,23
produce your energy maybe
you'll give me


124
0:5:58,23 --> 0:6:0,51
some food or whatnot.


125
0:6:0,51 --> 0:6:2,15
And so they started
evolving together.


126
0:6:2,15 --> 0:6:3,74
And they turned into
one organism.


127
0:6:3,74 --> 0:6:6,46
Which makes you wonder what we
might evolve-- well anyway,


128
0:6:6,46 --> 0:6:7,33
that's a separate thing.


129
0:6:7,33 --> 0:6:9,51
So there's actually ribosomes
out here.


130
0:6:9,51 --> 0:6:10,45
That's good to think about.


131
0:6:10,45 --> 0:6:16,28
Just realize that at one point
in the evolutionary past, this


132
0:6:16,28 --> 0:6:18,51
organelle's ancestor
might have been


133
0:6:18,51 --> 0:6:20,37
an independent organism.


134
0:6:20,37 --> 0:6:22,69
But anyway, enough about
that speculation.


135
0:6:22,69 --> 0:6:29,76
Let's zoom in again on one of
these thylakoid membranes.


136
0:6:29,76 --> 0:6:31,1
So I'm going to zoom in.


137
0:6:31,1 --> 0:6:32,26
Let me make a box.


138
0:6:32,26 --> 0:6:34,57



139
0:6:34,57 --> 0:6:37,7
Let me zoom in right there.


140
0:6:37,7 --> 0:6:38,99
So that's going to be
my zoom-in box.


141
0:6:38,99 --> 0:6:41,77
So let me make it really big.


142
0:6:41,77 --> 0:6:42,34
Just like this.


143
0:6:42,34 --> 0:6:45,56
So this is my zoom-in box.


144
0:6:45,56 --> 0:6:49,19
So that little box is the same
thing as this whole box.


145
0:6:49,19 --> 0:6:53,18
So we're zoomed in on the
thylakoid membrane.


146
0:6:53,18 --> 0:6:57,51
So this is the thylakoid
membrane right there.


147
0:6:57,51 --> 0:6:59,81
That's actually a phospho-bilipd
layer.


148
0:6:59,81 --> 0:7:4,2
It has your hydrophilic,
hydrophobic tails.


149
0:7:4,2 --> 0:7:5,66
I mean, I could draw it
like that if you like.


150
0:7:5,66 --> 0:7:7,81
The important thing from the
photosynthesis point of view


151
0:7:7,81 --> 0:7:9,55
is that it's this membrane.


152
0:7:9,55 --> 0:7:13,29
And on the outside of the
membrane, right here on the


153
0:7:13,29 --> 0:7:16,94
outside, you have the fluid
that fills up the entire


154
0:7:16,94 --> 0:7:20,54
chloroplast. So here you
have the stroma.


155
0:7:20,54 --> 0:7:23,21
And then this space right here,
this is the inside of


156
0:7:23,21 --> 0:7:24,62
your thylakoid.


157
0:7:24,62 --> 0:7:25,78
So this is the lumen.


158
0:7:25,78 --> 0:7:27,88
So if I were to color it
pink, right there.


159
0:7:27,88 --> 0:7:29,2
This is your lumen.


160
0:7:29,2 --> 0:7:30,78
Your thylakoid space.


161
0:7:30,78 --> 0:7:33,39
And in this membrane, and this
might look a little bit


162
0:7:33,39 --> 0:7:36,19
familiar if you think about
mitochondria and the electron


163
0:7:36,19 --> 0:7:37,4
transport chain.


164
0:7:37,4 --> 0:7:39,94
What I'm going to describe in
this video actually is an


165
0:7:39,94 --> 0:7:41,77
electron transport chain.


166
0:7:41,77 --> 0:7:44,26
Many people might not consider
it the electron transport


167
0:7:44,26 --> 0:7:46,61
chain, but it's the same idea.


168
0:7:46,61 --> 0:7:48,66
Same general idea.


169
0:7:48,66 --> 0:7:51,28
So on this membrane you have
these proteins and these


170
0:7:51,28 --> 0:7:53,235
complexes of proteins
and molecules


171
0:7:53,235 --> 0:7:55,47
that span this membrane.


172
0:7:55,47 --> 0:7:58,14
So let me draw a
couple of them.


173
0:7:58,14 --> 0:8:1,596
So maybe I'll call this
one, photosystem II.


174
0:8:1,596 --> 0:8:4,5
And I'm calling it that because
that's what it is.


175
0:8:4,5 --> 0:8:5,82
Photosystem II.


176
0:8:5,82 --> 0:8:7,31
You have maybe another
complex.


177
0:8:7,31 --> 0:8:8,57
And these are hugely
complicated.


178
0:8:8,57 --> 0:8:11,4
I'll do a sneak peek of
what photosystem II


179
0:8:11,4 --> 0:8:12,67
actually looks like.


180
0:8:12,67 --> 0:8:15,18
This is actually what
photosystem II looks like.


181
0:8:15,18 --> 0:8:17,89
So, as you can see, it
truly is a complex.


182
0:8:17,89 --> 0:8:20,46
These cylindrical things,
these are proteins.


183
0:8:20,46 --> 0:8:23,58
These green things are
chlorophyll molecules.


184
0:8:23,58 --> 0:8:25,2
I mean, there's all sorts
of things going here.


185
0:8:25,2 --> 0:8:27,9
And they're all jumbled
together.


186
0:8:27,9 --> 0:8:29,3
I think a complex probably
is the best word.


187
0:8:29,3 --> 0:8:32,32
It's a bunch of proteins, a
bunch of molecules just


188
0:8:32,32 --> 0:8:35,46
jumbled together to perform a
very particular function.


189
0:8:35,46 --> 0:8:38,44
We're going to describe
that in a few seconds.


190
0:8:38,44 --> 0:8:40,58
So that's what photosystem
II looks like.


191
0:8:40,58 --> 0:8:43,85
Then you also have
photosystem I.


192
0:8:43,85 --> 0:8:47,51
And then you have other
molecules, other complexes.


193
0:8:47,51 --> 0:8:52,13
You have the cytochrome B6F
complex and I'll draw this in


194
0:8:52,13 --> 0:8:55,12
a different color right here.


195
0:8:55,12 --> 0:8:57,34
I don't want to get too
much into the weeds.


196
0:8:57,34 --> 0:8:59,3
Because the most important thing
is just to understand.


197
0:8:59,3 --> 0:9:2,79
So you have other protein
complexes, protein molecular


198
0:9:2,79 --> 0:9:6,15
complexes here that also
span the membrane.


199
0:9:6,15 --> 0:9:8,84
But the general idea-- I'll tell
you the general idea and


200
0:9:8,84 --> 0:9:11,85
then we'll go into the
specifics-- of what happens


201
0:9:11,85 --> 0:9:23,36
during the light reaction, or
the light dependent reaction,


202
0:9:23,36 --> 0:9:25,95
is you have some photons.


203
0:9:25,95 --> 0:9:27,15
Photons from the sun.


204
0:9:27,15 --> 0:9:29,47
They've traveled 93
million miles.


205
0:9:29,47 --> 0:9:34,32
so you have some photons that
go here and they excite


206
0:9:34,32 --> 0:9:37,95
electrons in a chlorophyll
molecule, in a


207
0:9:37,95 --> 0:9:39,77
chlorophyll A molecule.


208
0:9:39,77 --> 0:9:42,92
And actually in photosystem II--
well, I won't go into the


209
0:9:42,92 --> 0:9:45,72
details just yet-- but they
excite a chlorophyll molecule


210
0:9:45,72 --> 0:9:49,6
so those electrons enter into
a high energy state.


211
0:9:49,6 --> 0:9:50,16
Maybe I shouldn't draw
it like that.


212
0:9:50,16 --> 0:9:51,69
They enter into a high
energy state.


213
0:9:51,69 --> 0:9:56,8
And then as they go from
molecule to molecule they keep


214
0:9:56,8 --> 0:9:57,76
going down in energy state.


215
0:9:57,76 --> 0:10:1,78
But as they go down in energy
state, you have hydrogen


216
0:10:1,78 --> 0:10:4,47
atoms, or actually I should say
hydrogen protons without


217
0:10:4,47 --> 0:10:5,7
the electrons.


218
0:10:5,7 --> 0:10:8,38
So you have all of these
hydrogen protons.


219
0:10:8,38 --> 0:10:12,58
Hydrogen protons get pumped
into the lumen.


220
0:10:12,58 --> 0:10:15,73
They get pumped into the lumen
and so you might remember this


221
0:10:15,73 --> 0:10:17,21
from the electron
transport chain.


222
0:10:17,21 --> 0:10:19,57
In the electron transport chain,
as electrons went from


223
0:10:19,57 --> 0:10:24,16
a high potential, a high energy
state, to a low energy


224
0:10:24,16 --> 0:10:27,11
state, that energy
was used to pump


225
0:10:27,11 --> 0:10:29,24
hydrogens through a membrane.


226
0:10:29,24 --> 0:10:33,29
And in that case it was in the
mitochondria, here the


227
0:10:33,29 --> 0:10:35,75
membrane is the thylakoid
membrane.


228
0:10:35,75 --> 0:10:39,75
But either case, you're creating
this gradient where--


229
0:10:39,75 --> 0:10:43,65
because of the energy from,
essentially the photons-- the


230
0:10:43,65 --> 0:10:46,33
electrons enter a high energy
state, they keep going into a


231
0:10:46,33 --> 0:10:47,37
lower energy state.


232
0:10:47,37 --> 0:10:49,87
And then they actually go to
photosystem I and they get hit


233
0:10:49,87 --> 0:10:50,91
by another photon.


234
0:10:50,91 --> 0:10:52,64
Well, that's a simplification,
but that's how you


235
0:10:52,64 --> 0:10:53,19
can think of it.


236
0:10:53,19 --> 0:10:55,35
Enter another high energy
state, then they go to a


237
0:10:55,35 --> 0:10:56,905
lower, lower and lower
energy state.


238
0:10:56,905 --> 0:10:59,54
But the whole time, that energy
from the electrons


239
0:10:59,54 --> 0:11:2,76
going from a high energy state
to a low energy state is used


240
0:11:2,76 --> 0:11:7,12
to pump hydrogen protons
into the lumen.


241
0:11:7,12 --> 0:11:8,4
So you have this huge


242
0:11:8,4 --> 0:11:11,44
concentration of hydrogen protons.


243
0:11:11,44 --> 0:11:17,68
And just like what we saw in the
electron transport chain,


244
0:11:17,68 --> 0:11:21,98
that concentration is then-- of
hydrogen protons-- is then


245
0:11:21,98 --> 0:11:24,97
used to drive ATP synthase.


246
0:11:24,97 --> 0:11:28,32
So the exact same-- let me see
if I can draw that ATP


247
0:11:28,32 --> 0:11:29,31
synthase here.


248
0:11:29,31 --> 0:11:30,88
You might remember ATP
synthase looks


249
0:11:30,88 --> 0:11:33,16
something like this.


250
0:11:33,16 --> 0:11:36,5
Where literally, so here you
have a huge concentration of


251
0:11:36,5 --> 0:11:37,85
hydrogen protons.


252
0:11:37,85 --> 0:11:41,1
So they'll want to
go back into the


253
0:11:41,1 --> 0:11:42,23
stroma from the lumen.


254
0:11:42,23 --> 0:11:42,9
And they do.


255
0:11:42,9 --> 0:11:45,67
And they go through
the ATP synthase.


256
0:11:45,67 --> 0:11:47,2
Let me do it in a new color.


257
0:11:47,2 --> 0:11:51,82
So these hydrogen protons are
going to make their way back.


258
0:11:51,82 --> 0:11:53,21
Go back down the gradient.


259
0:11:53,21 --> 0:11:55,9
And as they go down the
gradient, they literally--


260
0:11:55,9 --> 0:11:56,71
it's like an engine.


261
0:11:56,71 --> 0:11:59,71
And I go into detail on this
when I talk about respiration.


262
0:11:59,71 --> 0:12:4,2
And that turns, literally
mechanically turns, this top


263
0:12:4,2 --> 0:12:6,85
part-- the way I drew it--
of the ATP synthase.


264
0:12:6,85 --> 0:12:11,76
And it puts ADP and phosphate
groups together.


265
0:12:11,76 --> 0:12:15,56
It puts ADP plus phosphate
groups


266
0:12:15,56 --> 0:12:20,26
together to produce ATP.


267
0:12:20,26 --> 0:12:22,74
So that's the general,
very high overview.


268
0:12:22,74 --> 0:12:25,11
And I'm going to go into more
detail in a second.


269
0:12:25,11 --> 0:12:29,5
But this process that I just
described is called


270
0:12:29,5 --> 0:12:32,2
photophosphorylation.


271
0:12:32,2 --> 0:12:33,45
Let me do it in a nice color.


272
0:12:33,45 --> 0:12:40,44



273
0:12:40,44 --> 0:12:41,85
Why is it called that?


274
0:12:41,85 --> 0:12:43,39
Well, because we're
using photons.


275
0:12:43,39 --> 0:12:44,46
That's the photo part.


276
0:12:44,46 --> 0:12:45,27
We're using light.


277
0:12:45,27 --> 0:12:49,19
We're using photons to excite
electrons in chlorophyll.


278
0:12:49,19 --> 0:12:52,43
As those electrons get passed
from one molecule, from one


279
0:12:52,43 --> 0:12:55,96
electron acceptor to another,
they enter into lower and


280
0:12:55,96 --> 0:12:57,48
lower energy states.


281
0:12:57,48 --> 0:13:1,17
As they go into lower energy
states, that's used to drive,


282
0:13:1,17 --> 0:13:5,27
literally, pumps that allow
hydrogen protons to go from


283
0:13:5,27 --> 0:13:7,24
the stroma to the lumen.


284
0:13:7,24 --> 0:13:9,9
Then the hydrogen protons
want to go back.


285
0:13:9,9 --> 0:13:13,1
They want to-- I guess you could
call it-- chemiosmosis.


286
0:13:13,1 --> 0:13:16,77
They want to go back into the
stroma and then that drives


287
0:13:16,77 --> 0:13:19,18
ATP synthase.


288
0:13:19,18 --> 0:13:21,94
Right here, this is
ATP synthase.


289
0:13:21,94 --> 0:13:26,27
ATP synthase to essentially
jam together ADPs and


290
0:13:26,27 --> 0:13:29,81
phosphate groups
to produce ATP.


291
0:13:29,81 --> 0:13:34,45
Now, when I originally talked
about the light reactions and


292
0:13:34,45 --> 0:13:37,1
dark reactions I said, well the
light reactions have two


293
0:13:37,1 --> 0:13:38,5
byproducts.


294
0:13:38,5 --> 0:13:42,77
It has ATP and it also has--
actually it has three.


295
0:13:42,77 --> 0:13:46,62
It has ATP, and it
also has NADPH.


296
0:13:46,62 --> 0:13:49,34
NADP is reduced.


297
0:13:49,34 --> 0:13:51,8
It gains these electrons
and these hydrogens.


298
0:13:51,8 --> 0:13:53,6
So where does that show up?


299
0:13:53,6 --> 0:13:56,67
Well, if we're talking about
non-cyclic oxidative


300
0:13:56,67 --> 0:14:0,3
photophosphorylation, or
non-cyclic light reactions,


301
0:14:0,3 --> 0:14:1,96
the final electron acceptor.


302
0:14:1,96 --> 0:14:5,33
So after that electron keeps
entering lower and lower


303
0:14:5,33 --> 0:14:7,445
energy states, the
final electron


304
0:14:7,445 --> 0:14:12,9
acceptor is NADP plus.


305
0:14:12,9 --> 0:14:14,34
So once it accepts the electrons
and a hydrogen


306
0:14:14,34 --> 0:14:17,45
proton with it, it
becomes NADPH.


307
0:14:17,45 --> 0:14:20,48



308
0:14:20,48 --> 0:14:25,59
Now, I also said that part of
this process, water-- and this


309
0:14:25,59 --> 0:14:30,1
is actually a very interesting
thing-- water gets oxidized to


310
0:14:30,1 --> 0:14:31,27
molecular oxygen.


311
0:14:31,27 --> 0:14:32,98
So where does that happen?


312
0:14:32,98 --> 0:14:37,6
So when I said, up here in
photosystem I, that we have a


313
0:14:37,6 --> 0:14:43,22
chlorophyll molecule that has
an electron excited, and it


314
0:14:43,22 --> 0:14:44,51
goes into a higher
energy state.


315
0:14:44,51 --> 0:14:46,41
And then that electron
essentially gets passed from


316
0:14:46,41 --> 0:14:50,47
one guy to the next, that begs
the question, what can we use


317
0:14:50,47 --> 0:14:52,55
to replace that electron?


318
0:14:52,55 --> 0:14:56,34
And it turns out that we use,
we literally use, the


319
0:14:56,34 --> 0:14:57,69
electrons in water.


320
0:14:57,69 --> 0:15:3,87
So over here you literally
have H2O.


321
0:15:3,87 --> 0:15:8,0
And H2O donates the hydrogens
and the electrons with it.


322
0:15:8,0 --> 0:15:10,86
So you can kind of imagine it
donates two hydrogen protons


323
0:15:10,86 --> 0:15:14,93
and two electrons to replace the
electron that got excited


324
0:15:14,93 --> 0:15:15,86
by the photons.


325
0:15:15,86 --> 0:15:17,78
Because that electron got passed
all the way over to


326
0:15:17,78 --> 0:15:21,1
photosystem I and eventually
ends up in NADPH.


327
0:15:21,1 --> 0:15:26,63
So, you're literally stripping
electrons off of water.


328
0:15:26,63 --> 0:15:28,65
And when you strip off the
electrons and the hydrogens,


329
0:15:28,65 --> 0:15:30,47
you're just left with
molecular oxygen.


330
0:15:30,47 --> 0:15:33,3
Now, the reason why I want to
really focus on this is that


331
0:15:33,3 --> 0:15:34,97
there's something profound
happening here.


332
0:15:34,97 --> 0:15:36,5
Or at least on a chemistry
level,


333
0:15:36,5 --> 0:15:37,6
something profound is happening.


334
0:15:37,6 --> 0:15:43,51
You're oxidizing water.


335
0:15:43,51 --> 0:15:46,48
And in the entire biological
kingdom, the only place where


336
0:15:46,48 --> 0:15:49,29
we know something that is strong
enough of an oxidizing


337
0:15:49,29 --> 0:15:52,4
agent to oxidize water, to
literally take away electrons


338
0:15:52,4 --> 0:15:53,21
from water.


339
0:15:53,21 --> 0:15:54,64
Which means you're
really taking


340
0:15:54,64 --> 0:15:56,68
electrons away from oxygen.


341
0:15:56,68 --> 0:15:58,83
So you're oxidizing oxygen.


342
0:15:58,83 --> 0:16:2,12
The only place that we know
that an oxidation agent is


343
0:16:2,12 --> 0:16:6,56
strong enough to do this
is in photosystem II.


344
0:16:6,56 --> 0:16:9,56
So it's a very profound idea,
that normally electrons are


345
0:16:9,56 --> 0:16:10,96
very happy in water.


346
0:16:10,96 --> 0:16:14,66
They're very happy circulating
around oxygens.


347
0:16:14,66 --> 0:16:17,31
Oxygen is a very electronegative
atom.


348
0:16:17,31 --> 0:16:20,83
That's why we even call it
oxidizing, because oxygen is


349
0:16:20,83 --> 0:16:23,23
very good at oxidizing things.


350
0:16:23,23 --> 0:16:25,36
But all of a sudden we've
found something that can


351
0:16:25,36 --> 0:16:29,48
oxidize oxygen, that can strip
electrons off of oxygen and


352
0:16:29,48 --> 0:16:32,68
then give those electrons
to the chlorophyll.


353
0:16:32,68 --> 0:16:35,14
The electron gets excited
by photons.


354
0:16:35,14 --> 0:16:36,98
Then those photons enter
lower and lower and


355
0:16:36,98 --> 0:16:37,94
lower energy states.


356
0:16:37,94 --> 0:16:40,245
Get excited again in photosystem
I by another set


357
0:16:40,245 --> 0:16:42,87
of photons and then enter lower
and lower and lower


358
0:16:42,87 --> 0:16:43,75
energy states.


359
0:16:43,75 --> 0:16:47,5
And then finally,
end up at NADPH.


360
0:16:47,5 --> 0:16:50,14
And the whole time it entered
lower and lower energy states,


361
0:16:50,14 --> 0:16:54,17
that energy was being used to
pump hydrogen across this


362
0:16:54,17 --> 0:16:56,35
membrane from the
stroma to lumen.


363
0:16:56,35 --> 0:17:1,25
And then that gradient is used
to actually produce ATP.


364
0:17:1,25 --> 0:17:3,5
So in the next video I'm going
to give a little bit more


365
0:17:3,5 --> 0:17:7,5
context about what this means
in terms of energy states of


366
0:17:7,5 --> 0:17:11,4
electrons and what's at a higher
or lower energy state.


367
0:17:11,4 --> 0:17:13,2
But this is essentially
all that's happening.


368
0:17:13,2 --> 0:17:14,45
Electrons get excited.


369
0:17:14,45 --> 0:17:17,119



370
0:17:17,119 --> 0:17:19,859
Those electrons eventually
end up at NADPH.


371
0:17:19,859 --> 0:17:23,65
And as the electron gets excited
and goes into lower


372
0:17:23,65 --> 0:17:25,16
and lower energy states,
it pumps


373
0:17:25,16 --> 0:17:27,29
hydrogen across the gradient.


374
0:17:27,29 --> 0:17:30,9
And then that gradient is used
to drive ATP synthase, to


375
0:17:30,9 --> 0:17:32,11
generate ATP.


376
0:17:32,11 --> 0:17:34,27
And then that original electron
that got excited, it


377
0:17:34,27 --> 0:17:35,48
had to be replaced.


378
0:17:35,48 --> 0:17:39,2
And that replaced electron is
actually stripped off of H2O.


379
0:17:39,2 --> 0:17:42,68
So the hydrogen protons and
the electrons of H2O are


380
0:17:42,68 --> 0:17:46,3
stripped away and you're just
left with molecular oxygen.


381
0:17:46,3 --> 0:17:49,7
And just to get a nice
appreciation of the complexity


382
0:17:49,7 --> 0:17:51,97
of all of this-- I showed you
this earlier in the video--


383
0:17:51,97 --> 0:17:55,25
but this is literally a-- I mean
this isn't a picture of


384
0:17:55,25 --> 0:17:56,1
photosystem II.


385
0:17:56,1 --> 0:17:57,83
You actually don't have
cylinders like this.


386
0:17:57,83 --> 0:18:1,11
But these cylinders represent
proteins.


387
0:18:1,11 --> 0:18:7,49
Right here, these green kind
of scaffold-like molecules,


388
0:18:7,49 --> 0:18:9,39
that's chlorophyll A.


389
0:18:9,39 --> 0:18:15,39
And what literally happens, is
you have photons hitting--


390
0:18:15,39 --> 0:18:17,535
actually it doesn't always have
to hit chlorophyll A.


391
0:18:17,535 --> 0:18:20,29
It can also hit what's called
antenna molecules.


392
0:18:20,29 --> 0:18:22,55
So antenna molecules are other
types of chlorophyll, and


393
0:18:22,55 --> 0:18:24,98
actually other types
of molecules.


394
0:18:24,98 --> 0:18:31,51
And so a photon, or a set of
photons, comes here and maybe


395
0:18:31,51 --> 0:18:35,44
it excites some electrons,
it doesn't have to be in


396
0:18:35,44 --> 0:18:35,87
chlorophyll A.


397
0:18:35,87 --> 0:18:38,22
It could be in some of these
other types of chlorophyll.


398
0:18:38,22 --> 0:18:41,2
Or in some of these other I
guess you could call them,


399
0:18:41,2 --> 0:18:44,67
pigment molecules that will
absorb these photons.


400
0:18:44,67 --> 0:18:46,5
And then their electrons
get excited.


401
0:18:46,5 --> 0:18:48,69
And you can almost imagine
it as a vibration.


402
0:18:48,69 --> 0:18:50,87
But when you're talking about
things on the quantum level,


403
0:18:50,87 --> 0:18:52,23
vibrations really don't
make sense.


404
0:18:52,23 --> 0:18:53,41
But it's a good analogy.


405
0:18:53,41 --> 0:18:55,97
They kind of vibrate their
way to chlorophyll A.


406
0:18:55,97 --> 0:18:58,535
And this is called
resonance energy.


407
0:18:58,535 --> 0:19:4,66



408
0:19:4,66 --> 0:19:7,44
They vibrate their way,
eventually, to chlorophyll A.


409
0:19:7,44 --> 0:19:11,95
And then in chlorophyll A, you
have the electron get excited.


410
0:19:11,95 --> 0:19:15,62
The primary electron acceptor
is actually this molecule


411
0:19:15,62 --> 0:19:16,46
right here.


412
0:19:16,46 --> 0:19:17,47
Pheophytin.


413
0:19:17,47 --> 0:19:19,1
Some people call it pheo.


414
0:19:19,1 --> 0:19:22,38
And then from there, it keeps
getting passed on from one


415
0:19:22,38 --> 0:19:23,2
molecule to another.


416
0:19:23,2 --> 0:19:25,69
I'll talk a little bit more
about that in the next video.


417
0:19:25,69 --> 0:19:26,73
But this is fascinating.


418
0:19:26,73 --> 0:19:28,39
Look how complicated this is.


419
0:19:28,39 --> 0:19:32,21
In order to essentially excite
electrons and then use those


420
0:19:32,21 --> 0:19:36,6
electrons to start the
process of pumping


421
0:19:36,6 --> 0:19:37,2
hydrogens across a membrane.


422
0:19:37,2 --> 0:19:39,3
And this is an interesting
place right here.


423
0:19:39,3 --> 0:19:40,95
This is the water
oxidation site.


424
0:19:40,95 --> 0:19:44,37
So I got very excited about the
idea of oxidizing water.


425
0:19:44,37 --> 0:19:48,14
And so this is actually where
it occurs in the photosystem


426
0:19:48,14 --> 0:19:49,24
II complex.


427
0:19:49,24 --> 0:19:51,22
And you actually have this very
complicated mechanism.


428
0:19:51,22 --> 0:19:54,88
Because it's no joke to actually
strip away electrons


429
0:19:54,88 --> 0:19:58,11
and hydrogens from an actual
water molecule.


430
0:19:58,11 --> 0:19:59,1
I'll leave you there.


431
0:19:59,1 --> 0:20:1,87
And in the next video I'll talk
a little bit more about


432
0:20:1,87 --> 0:20:2,89
these energy states.


433
0:20:2,89 --> 0:20:5,38
And I'll fill in a little bit of
the gaps about what some of


434
0:20:5,38 --> 0:20:10,99
these other molecules that act
as hydrogen acceptors.


435
0:20:10,99 --> 0:20:12,47
Or you can also view
them as electron


436
0:20:12,47 --> 0:20:15,35
acceptors along the way.


437
0:20:15,35 --> 0:22:15,35
