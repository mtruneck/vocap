MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: The Orange
Lodge in Belfast, the oldest


5
0:0:24,17 --> 0:0:26,37
Protestant fraternal
organization in the country,


6
0:0:26,37 --> 0:0:28,12
organizes the July 12 parade.


7
0:0:28,12 --> 0:0:30,3
Before the start of the march,
we stopped by their


8
0:0:30,3 --> 0:0:30,81
headquarters.


9
0:0:30,81 --> 0:0:33,13
It was teeming with people
from all around the


10
0:0:33,13 --> 0:0:34,5
Anglosphere.


11
0:0:34,5 --> 0:0:37,8
TOM HAIRE: The 12th of July is
the commemorating of the 121st


12
0:0:37,8 --> 0:0:41,31
anniversary of the Battle
of the Boyne.


13
0:0:41,31 --> 0:0:44,7
It is important to do because
at the end of the day, the


14
0:0:44,7 --> 0:0:47,1
Battle of the Boyne gave
everyone through the world,


15
0:0:47,1 --> 0:0:50,94
shall we say, civil and
religious liberty.


16
0:0:50,94 --> 0:0:54,66
And sometimes that liberty, at
the moment, is being eroded by


17
0:0:54,66 --> 0:0:58,9
different legislation, which
affects some of our parade.


18
0:0:58,9 --> 0:1:1,27
MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: Explain to
those who would be completely


19
0:1:1,27 --> 0:1:4,79
baffled by this how a bunch of
Canadians come to march in an


20
0:1:4,79 --> 0:1:6,4
Orange parade in Belfast.


21
0:1:6,4 --> 0:1:7,26
MALE SPEAKER: My family
roots here are


22
0:1:7,26 --> 0:1:8,57
five generations gone.


23
0:1:8,57 --> 0:1:10,27
Like, I'm a five-generation
Canadian, but


24
0:1:10,27 --> 0:1:11,53
all Orange, in Canada.


25
0:1:11,53 --> 0:1:14,26
Canada was a big place for
the Orange Order as well.


26
0:1:14,26 --> 0:1:16,75
We don't say a whole lot when
we come here, because


27
0:1:16,75 --> 0:1:18,18
unfortunately, it's
not our fight.


28
0:1:18,18 --> 0:1:20,122
MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: You're not
throwing paving stones at


29
0:1:20,122 --> 0:1:20,33
people


30
0:1:20,33 --> 0:1:20,962
MALE SPEAKER: No, no.


31
0:1:20,962 --> 0:1:22,17
MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: Molotov
cocktails.


32
0:1:22,17 --> 0:1:23,39
MALE SPEAKER: As you know,
Canadians, we're probably the


33
0:1:23,39 --> 0:1:25,58
most easygoing people around.


34
0:1:25,58 --> 0:1:33,31
[MARCHING BAND PLAYING]


35
0:1:33,31 --> 0:1:34,88
MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: The parades
have just begun.


36
0:1:34,88 --> 0:1:36,7
We're walking down
Crumlin Road.


37
0:1:36,7 --> 0:1:38,78
As you can see, I am
leading the parade.


38
0:1:38,78 --> 0:1:42,61
I am leaving the Prods down
Crumlin road to a flash point


39
0:1:42,61 --> 0:1:44,47
very close to here.


40
0:1:44,47 --> 0:1:46,28
So far, there hasn't
been a hitch.


41
0:1:46,28 --> 0:1:49,46
There's police presence,
very, very, very heavy.


42
0:1:49,46 --> 0:1:52,242
And we'll see what happens.


43
0:1:52,242 --> 0:2:18,7
[MARCHING BAND PLAYING]


44
0:2:18,7 --> 0:2:19,815
MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: To everyone
willing to talk to us, the


45
0:2:19,815 --> 0:2:22,31
parade was a celebration
of Protestant culture.


46
0:2:22,31 --> 0:2:24,62
But increasingly, it became
apparent that it was also a


47
0:2:24,62 --> 0:2:27,295
celebration of that particular
Ulster talent for massive


48
0:2:27,295 --> 0:2:28,786
alcohol consumption.


49
0:2:28,786 --> 0:2:32,74
We're about an hour into this
march in Ulster, in the city


50
0:2:32,74 --> 0:2:34,28
center of Belfast.


51
0:2:34,28 --> 0:2:37,11
Things, according to Twitter,
that we're following this on,


52
0:2:37,11 --> 0:2:38,83
have passed off fairly
peacefully in


53
0:2:38,83 --> 0:2:40,2
all the flash points.


54
0:2:40,2 --> 0:2:41,55
But the atmosphere's
a bit strange.


55
0:2:41,55 --> 0:2:42,83
It's a bit somber.


56
0:2:42,83 --> 0:2:43,695
It's a bit grey.


57
0:2:43,695 --> 0:2:44,84
It's a bit dim.


58
0:2:44,84 --> 0:2:47,4
We were told last night that
Protestants don't like to talk


59
0:2:47,4 --> 0:2:48,46
people from the media.


60
0:2:48,46 --> 0:2:51,13
So we've asked a few people to
talk to us to tell us what's


61
0:2:51,13 --> 0:2:53,86
going on here, and
no one wants to.


62
0:2:53,86 --> 0:2:58,71
So tonight is when it kicks off,
and so we're just waiting


63
0:2:58,71 --> 0:3:2,87
to go up to the sort of mixed
areas up by Ardoyne, where it


64
0:3:2,87 --> 0:3:4,27
was bad last year.


65
0:3:4,27 --> 0:3:6,77
And the police presence is
going to be pretty heavy.


66
0:3:6,77 --> 0:3:9,306
And apparently that's when it's
going to get a bit hairy.


67
0:3:9,306 --> 0:3:11,14
FEMALE SPEAKER: (SINGING) We
will hear the people cry, let


68
0:3:11,14 --> 0:3:18,58
the POA go by, We are the
pride of Ardoyne.


69
0:3:18,58 --> 0:3:20,79
MALE SPEAKER 1: Well, I disagree
with the march or the


70
0:3:20,79 --> 0:3:24,6
parade being allowed to walk
through the district that it


71
0:3:24,6 --> 0:3:27,45
does walk through, the road that
it walks on, because of


72
0:3:27,45 --> 0:3:29,74
the symbolism that
it deals with.


73
0:3:29,74 --> 0:3:33,9
In one case, they would carry a
banner to a UVF man who had


74
0:3:33,9 --> 0:3:33,99
killed a Catholic.


75
0:3:33,99 --> 0:3:37,33
That, obviously, is about more
than just symbolism.


76
0:3:37,33 --> 0:3:38,98
That's about rubbing
your nose in it.


77
0:3:38,98 --> 0:3:40,9
MALE SPEAKER 2: The Loyalist
position on that would be that


78
0:3:40,9 --> 0:3:44,66
it's a traditional route,
it's historical.


79
0:3:44,66 --> 0:3:46,22
Obviously, I believe that
there does need to be


80
0:3:46,22 --> 0:3:51,5
dialogue, and I think symbols
and flags and songs that are


81
0:3:51,5 --> 0:3:54,62
deliberately designed to be
provocative, that that


82
0:3:54,62 --> 0:3:56,55
certainly should be
talked about.


83
0:3:56,55 --> 0:3:59,46
MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: Things are
going slightly gnarlier.


84
0:3:59,46 --> 0:4:3,52
Packs of kids that we tried to
talk to, who were drinking


85
0:4:3,52 --> 0:4:6,72
bottles of straight vodka and
smoking weed on the street,


86
0:4:6,72 --> 0:4:10,16
got a little friendly with the
camera and were a bit grabby.


87
0:4:10,16 --> 0:4:43,52



88
0:4:43,52 --> 0:4:46,13
MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: So we've
been-- we've been marching for


89
0:4:46,13 --> 0:4:51,4
a couple hours now, and we've
passed city center, and I


90
0:4:51,4 --> 0:4:54,73
think it's time for us to peel
off here and go find some


91
0:4:54,73 --> 0:4:55,33
Republicans.


92
0:4:55,33 --> 0:4:57,73
So we're gonna get the fuck out
of here, because things


93
0:4:57,73 --> 0:5:0,43
are getting drunker and uglier.


94
0:5:0,43 --> 0:7:0,43
