1
0:0:0,633 --> 0:0:2,5
The President:
It is good to be
back in Michigan.


2
0:0:2,5 --> 0:0:4,867
(applause)


3
0:0:4,867 --> 0:0:6,166
How is everybody doing today?


4
0:0:6,166 --> 0:0:8,934
(applause)


5
0:0:8,934 --> 0:0:12,333
Now, let me just start off
by saying we have something


6
0:0:12,333 --> 0:0:17,266
in common -- both our
teams lost yesterday.


7
0:0:17,266 --> 0:0:19,834
(laughter)


8
0:0:19,834 --> 0:0:24,433
I mean, I would like to come
here and talk a little smack


9
0:0:24,433 --> 0:0:29,1
about the Bears, but we
didn't quite get it done.


10
0:0:29,1 --> 0:0:32,9
But it is wonderful to be back.


11
0:0:32,9 --> 0:0:36,233
It is good to see everybody in
the great state of Michigan.


12
0:0:36,233 --> 0:0:43,0
(applause)


13
0:0:43,0 --> 0:0:44,433
A few people I want to
acknowledge -- first of all,


14
0:0:44,433 --> 0:0:47,4
the Mayor of Detroit here --
Dave Bing is in the house.


15
0:0:47,4 --> 0:0:51,133
(applause)


16
0:0:51,133 --> 0:0:54,7
We've got the Redford Supervisor
-- Tracey Schultz Kobylarz.


17
0:0:54,7 --> 0:0:59,33
(applause)


18
0:0:59,33 --> 0:1:1,6
We've got some outstanding
members of Congress who are


19
0:1:1,6 --> 0:1:3,6
here -- please give them
a big round of applause.


20
0:1:3,6 --> 0:1:10,66
(applause)


21
0:1:10,66 --> 0:1:13,1
I want to thank
Martin for hosting us.


22
0:1:13,1 --> 0:1:17,0
I want to thank Jeff and Gibby
for giving me a great tour of


23
0:1:17,0 --> 0:1:18,33
the factory.


24
0:1:18,33 --> 0:1:24,867
(applause)


25
0:1:24,867 --> 0:1:28,367
I've got to say I love
coming to factories.


26
0:1:28,367 --> 0:1:29,1
Audience Member:
I love you!


27
0:1:29,1 --> 0:1:29,8
The President:
I love you.


28
0:1:29,8 --> 0:1:31,667
(applause)


29
0:1:31,667 --> 0:1:35,867
So in addition to seeing the
best workers in the world --


30
0:1:35,867 --> 0:1:41,767
(applause)


31
0:1:41,767 --> 0:1:44,7
-- you've also got all
this cool equipment.


32
0:1:44,7 --> 0:1:46,3
(laughter)


33
0:1:46,3 --> 0:1:50,934
I wanted to try out some of the
equipment, but Secret Service


34
0:1:50,934 --> 0:1:52,4
wouldn't let me.


35
0:1:52,4 --> 0:1:53,467
(laughter)


36
0:1:53,467 --> 0:1:55,4
They said, you're going to
drop something on your head,


37
0:1:55,4 --> 0:1:57,0
hurt yourself.


38
0:1:57,0 --> 0:1:58,0
(laughter)


39
0:1:58,0 --> 0:2:0,633
They were worried I'd
mess something up.


40
0:2:0,633 --> 0:2:4,9
And Jeff and Gibby may not admit
it, but I think they were pretty


41
0:2:4,9 --> 0:2:6,2
happy the Secret Service
wouldn't let me touch


42
0:2:6,2 --> 0:2:7,1
the equipment.


43
0:2:7,1 --> 0:2:10,0
(laughter)


44
0:2:10,0 --> 0:2:15,567
Now, it's been a little over a
month since the election came


45
0:2:15,567 --> 0:2:16,4
to an end.


46
0:2:16,4 --> 0:2:24,433
(applause)


47
0:2:24,433 --> 0:2:27,133
So it's now safe for you to
turn your televisions back on.


48
0:2:27,133 --> 0:2:29,4
(laughter)


49
0:2:29,4 --> 0:2:33,2
All those scary political
ads are off the air.


50
0:2:33,2 --> 0:2:35,867
You can answer your phone again
-- nobody is calling you in the


51
0:2:35,867 --> 0:2:40,8
middle of dinner asking
for your support.


52
0:2:40,8 --> 0:2:44,133
But, look, I have to admit
there's one part of the campaign


53
0:2:44,133 --> 0:2:48,367
that I miss, and that is it is
a great excuse for me to get out


54
0:2:48,367 --> 0:2:53,333
of Washington and come to towns
like this and talk to the people


55
0:2:53,333 --> 0:2:56,967
who work so hard every day
and are looking out for their


56
0:2:56,967 --> 0:3:1,0
families and are in their
communities, and just having a


57
0:3:1,0 --> 0:3:5,166
conversation about what kind of
country do we want to be; what


58
0:3:5,166 --> 0:3:7,667
kind of country do we want
to leave behind for our kids.


59
0:3:7,667 --> 0:3:12,9
Because ultimately,
that's what this is about.


60
0:3:12,9 --> 0:3:16,8
And I believe -- and I've been
saying this not just for the


61
0:3:16,8 --> 0:3:20,533
last six months or the last
year, but ever since I got into


62
0:3:20,533 --> 0:3:24,3
public office -- I believe
America only succeeds and


63
0:3:24,3 --> 0:3:27,333
thrives when we've got a strong
and growing middle class.


64
0:3:27,333 --> 0:3:28,367
(applause)


65
0:3:28,367 --> 0:3:30,567
That's what I believe.


66
0:3:30,567 --> 0:3:35,33
(applause)


67
0:3:35,33 --> 0:3:38,767
I believe we're at our best when
everybody who works hard has a


68
0:3:38,767 --> 0:3:44,333
chance to get ahead; that they
can get a job that pays the


69
0:3:44,333 --> 0:3:48,367
bills; that they've got health
care that they can count on;


70
0:3:48,367 --> 0:3:51,633
that they can retire with
dignity and respect, maybe take


71
0:3:51,633 --> 0:3:56,767
a vacation once in a while --
nothing fancy, just being able


72
0:3:56,767 --> 0:4:2,467
to pack up the kids and go
someplace and enjoy time with


73
0:4:2,467 --> 0:4:7,834
people that you love; make sure
that your kids can go to a good


74
0:4:7,834 --> 0:4:12,333
school; make sure they
can aspire to whatever


75
0:4:12,333 --> 0:4:14,8
they want to be.


76
0:4:14,8 --> 0:4:18,533
That idea is what built America.


77
0:4:18,533 --> 0:4:21,133
That's the idea
that built Michigan.


78
0:4:21,133 --> 0:4:24,367
That's the idea that's at the
heart of the economic plan I've


79
0:4:24,367 --> 0:4:28,967
been talking about all year
long on the campaign trail.


80
0:4:28,967 --> 0:4:31,633
I want to give more Americans
the chance to earn the skills


81
0:4:31,633 --> 0:4:35,633
that businesses are looking for
right now, and give our kids the


82
0:4:35,633 --> 0:4:38,333
kind of education they need to
succeed in the 21st century.


83
0:4:38,333 --> 0:4:42,66
I want to make sure America
leads the world in research


84
0:4:42,66 --> 0:4:44,266
and technology and clean energy.


85
0:4:44,266 --> 0:4:48,367
I want to put people back to
work rebuilding our roads and


86
0:4:48,367 --> 0:4:49,9
our bridges and our schools.


87
0:4:49,9 --> 0:4:53,5
(applause)


88
0:4:53,5 --> 0:4:58,266
That's how we grow an economy.


89
0:4:58,266 --> 0:5:2,333
I want us to bring down our
deficits, but I want to do it


90
0:5:2,333 --> 0:5:6,33
in a balanced, responsible way.


91
0:5:6,33 --> 0:5:11,3
And I want to reward -- I want a
tax code that rewards businesses


92
0:5:11,3 --> 0:5:16,433
and manufacturers like Detroit
Diesel right here, creating jobs


93
0:5:16,433 --> 0:5:19,4
right here in Redford, right
here in Michigan, right here


94
0:5:19,4 --> 0:5:21,0
in the United States of America.


95
0:5:21,0 --> 0:5:29,967
(applause)


96
0:5:29,967 --> 0:5:32,33
That's where we need to go.


97
0:5:32,33 --> 0:5:36,0
That's the country
we need to build.


98
0:5:36,0 --> 0:5:39,367
And when it comes to bringing
manufacturing back to America --


99
0:5:39,367 --> 0:5:42,9
that's why I'm here today.


100
0:5:42,9 --> 0:5:47,266
Since 1938, Detroit Diesel has
been turning out some of the


101
0:5:47,266 --> 0:5:48,834
best engines in the world.


102
0:5:48,834 --> 0:5:55,467
(applause)


103
0:5:55,467 --> 0:5:58,667
Over all those years,
generations of Redford workers


104
0:5:58,667 --> 0:6:2,1
have walked through these doors.


105
0:6:2,1 --> 0:6:3,4
Not just to punch a clock.


106
0:6:3,4 --> 0:6:5,467
Not just to pick up a paycheck.


107
0:6:5,467 --> 0:6:8,6
Not just to build an engine.


108
0:6:8,6 --> 0:6:12,867
But to build a middle-class life
for their families; to earn a


109
0:6:12,867 --> 0:6:16,367
shot at the American Dream.


110
0:6:16,367 --> 0:6:20,633
For seven and a half decades,
through good times and bad,


111
0:6:20,633 --> 0:6:23,266
through revolutions in
technology that sent a lot of


112
0:6:23,266 --> 0:6:28,967
good jobs -- manufacturing jobs
-- overseas, men and women like


113
0:6:28,967 --> 0:6:32,4
you, your parents, maybe even
your grandparents, have done


114
0:6:32,4 --> 0:6:38,1
your part to build up America's
manufacturing strength.


115
0:6:38,1 --> 0:6:41,133
That's something you
can all be proud of.


116
0:6:41,133 --> 0:6:46,4
And now you're writing a new
proud chapter to that history.


117
0:6:46,4 --> 0:6:49,834
Eight years ago, you started
building axles here alongside


118
0:6:49,834 --> 0:6:50,834
the engines.


119
0:6:50,834 --> 0:6:51,834
That meant more work.


120
0:6:51,834 --> 0:6:52,967
That meant more jobs.


121
0:6:52,967 --> 0:6:57,967
(applause)


122
0:6:57,967 --> 0:7:1,2
So you started seeing products
-- more products stamped with


123
0:7:1,2 --> 0:7:5,433
those three proud
words: Made in America.


124
0:7:5,433 --> 0:7:13,0
Today, Daimler is announcing
a new $120 million investment


125
0:7:13,0 --> 0:7:19,2
into this plant, creating 115
good, new union jobs building


126
0:7:19,2 --> 0:7:22,467
transmissions and turbochargers
right here in Redford --


127
0:7:22,467 --> 0:7:33,567
(applause)


128
0:7:33,567 --> 0:7:38,3
-- 115 good new jobs
right here in this plant,


129
0:7:38,3 --> 0:7:39,3
making things happen.


130
0:7:39,3 --> 0:7:40,667
That is great for the plant.


131
0:7:40,667 --> 0:7:42,9
It's great for this community.


132
0:7:42,9 --> 0:7:46,734
But it's also good for
American manufacturing.


133
0:7:46,734 --> 0:7:50,367
Soon, you guys will be building
all the key parts that go into


134
0:7:50,367 --> 0:7:55,2
powering a heavy-duty truck,
all at the same facility.


135
0:7:55,2 --> 0:7:57,66
Nobody else in
America is doing that.


136
0:7:57,66 --> 0:8:1,8
Nobody else in North
America is doing that.


137
0:8:1,8 --> 0:8:5,1
And by putting everything
together in one place,


138
0:8:5,1 --> 0:8:8,9
under one roof, Daimler
engineers can design each


139
0:8:8,9 --> 0:8:11,967
part so it works
better with the others.


140
0:8:11,967 --> 0:8:15,33
That means greater fuel
efficiency for your trucks.


141
0:8:15,33 --> 0:8:19,0
It means greater savings
for your customers.


142
0:8:19,0 --> 0:8:20,767
That's a big deal.


143
0:8:20,767 --> 0:8:23,266
And it's just the latest
example of Daimler's leadership


144
0:8:23,266 --> 0:8:24,266
on this issue.


145
0:8:24,266 --> 0:8:27,4
Last year, I was proud to have
your support when we announced


146
0:8:27,4 --> 0:8:30,467
the first-ever national
fuel-efficiency standards for


147
0:8:30,467 --> 0:8:33,7
commercial trucks, which is
going to help save consumers


148
0:8:33,7 --> 0:8:36,967
money and reduce our
dependence on foreign oil.


149
0:8:36,967 --> 0:8:38,233
That's good news.


150
0:8:38,233 --> 0:8:44,834
(applause)


151
0:8:44,834 --> 0:8:48,8
But here's the other reason
why what you guys are doing,


152
0:8:48,8 --> 0:8:50,333
what Daimler is doing,
is so important.


153
0:8:50,333 --> 0:8:53,166
For a long time, companies,
they weren't always making


154
0:8:53,166 --> 0:8:56,867
those kinds of investments
here in the United States.


155
0:8:56,867 --> 0:9:0,7
They weren't always investing
in American workers.


156
0:9:0,7 --> 0:9:2,633
They certainly weren't
willing to make them in


157
0:9:2,633 --> 0:9:4,4
the U.S. auto industry.


158
0:9:4,4 --> 0:9:6,7
Remember, it was just a few
years ago that our auto industry


159
0:9:6,7 --> 0:9:8,967
was on the verge of collapse.


160
0:9:8,967 --> 0:9:11,633
GM, Chrysler were all
on the brink of failure.


161
0:9:11,633 --> 0:9:14,967
And if they failed, the
suppliers and distributors


162
0:9:14,967 --> 0:9:17,133
that get their business
from those companies,


163
0:9:17,133 --> 0:9:18,166
they would have died off, too.


164
0:9:18,166 --> 0:9:22,5
Even Ford could have gone
down -- production halted.


165
0:9:22,5 --> 0:9:25,33
Factories shuttered.


166
0:9:25,33 --> 0:9:29,66
Once proud companies chopped
up and sold off for scraps.


167
0:9:29,66 --> 0:9:32,333
And all of you -- the men and
women who built these companies


168
0:9:32,333 --> 0:9:35,7
with your own hands -- would
have been hung out to dry.


169
0:9:35,7 --> 0:9:39,133
And everybody in this community
that depends on you --


170
0:9:39,133 --> 0:9:45,567
restaurant owners,
storekeepers, bartenders --


171
0:9:45,567 --> 0:9:54,8
(laughter and applause)


172
0:9:54,8 --> 0:9:58,7
-- their livelihoods would
have been at stake, too.


173
0:9:58,7 --> 0:10:0,33
So I wasn't about
to let that happen.


174
0:10:0,33 --> 0:10:1,867
I placed my bet on
American workers.


175
0:10:1,867 --> 0:10:3,967
We bet on American ingenuity.


176
0:10:3,967 --> 0:10:6,0
I'd make that same bet
any day of the week.


177
0:10:6,0 --> 0:10:12,266
(applause)


178
0:10:12,266 --> 0:10:15,66
Three and a half years later,
that bet is paying off.


179
0:10:15,66 --> 0:10:18,867
This industry has added over a
quarter of a million new jobs.


180
0:10:18,867 --> 0:10:20,333
Assembly lines
are humming again.


181
0:10:20,333 --> 0:10:23,567
The American auto
industry is back.


182
0:10:23,567 --> 0:10:27,467
And companies like Daimler
know you're still a smart bet.


183
0:10:27,467 --> 0:10:29,66
They could have made their
investment somewhere else,


184
0:10:29,66 --> 0:10:30,66
but they didn't.


185
0:10:30,66 --> 0:10:32,767
And if you ask them whether it
was a tough call, they'll tell


186
0:10:32,767 --> 0:10:35,3
you it wasn't even close.


187
0:10:35,3 --> 0:10:37,867
So the word is going out all
around the world: If you want to


188
0:10:37,867 --> 0:10:41,1
find the best workers in the
world, if you want to find the


189
0:10:41,1 --> 0:10:44,3
best factories in the world, if
you want to build the best cars


190
0:10:44,3 --> 0:10:48,867
or trucks or any other product
in the world, you should invest


191
0:10:48,867 --> 0:10:50,567
in the United States of America.


192
0:10:50,567 --> 0:10:51,4
This is the place to be.


193
0:10:51,4 --> 0:11:3,633
(applause)


194
0:11:3,633 --> 0:11:6,9
See, you're starting to see the
competitive balance is tipping a


195
0:11:6,9 --> 0:11:8,633
little bit.


196
0:11:8,633 --> 0:11:11,734
Over the past few years, it's
become more expensive to do


197
0:11:11,734 --> 0:11:14,2
business in
countries like China.


198
0:11:14,2 --> 0:11:17,467
Our workers have become
even more productive.


199
0:11:17,467 --> 0:11:21,0
Our energy costs are starting
to go down here in the United


200
0:11:21,0 --> 0:11:22,0
States.


201
0:11:22,0 --> 0:11:25,133
And we still have
the largest market.


202
0:11:25,133 --> 0:11:27,567
So when you factor in
everything, it makes sense


203
0:11:27,567 --> 0:11:29,3
to invest here, in America.


204
0:11:29,3 --> 0:11:32,967
And that's one of the reasons
why American manufacturing is


205
0:11:32,967 --> 0:11:35,6
growing at the fastest
pace since the 1990s.


206
0:11:35,6 --> 0:11:40,9
And thanks in part to that boost
in manufacturing, four years


207
0:11:40,9 --> 0:11:44,533
after the worst economic crisis
of our lifetimes, our economy is


208
0:11:44,533 --> 0:11:46,0
growing again.


209
0:11:46,0 --> 0:11:50,233
Our businesses have created more
than 5.5 million new jobs over


210
0:11:50,233 --> 0:11:52,633
the past 33 months.


211
0:11:52,633 --> 0:11:56,2
So we're making progress.


212
0:11:56,2 --> 0:11:58,433
(applause)


213
0:11:58,433 --> 0:12:1,66
We're moving in the
right direction.


214
0:12:1,66 --> 0:12:3,3
We're going forward.


215
0:12:3,3 --> 0:12:4,8
So what we need to do is simple.


216
0:12:4,8 --> 0:12:7,266
We need to keep going.


217
0:12:7,266 --> 0:12:9,266
We need to keep going forward.


218
0:12:9,266 --> 0:12:12,533
We should do everything we
can to keep creating good


219
0:12:12,533 --> 0:12:15,767
middle-class jobs that help
folks rebuild security for


220
0:12:15,767 --> 0:12:17,6
their families.


221
0:12:17,6 --> 0:12:23,33
(applause)


222
0:12:23,33 --> 0:12:26,567
And we should do everything we
can to encourage companies like


223
0:12:26,567 --> 0:12:31,33
Daimler to keep investing
in American workers.


224
0:12:31,33 --> 0:12:34,4
And by the way, what we
shouldn't do -- I just got


225
0:12:34,4 --> 0:12:37,8
to say this -- what we shouldn't
be doing is trying to take away


226
0:12:37,8 --> 0:12:39,367
your rights to bargain
for better wages and


227
0:12:39,367 --> 0:12:40,233
working conditions.


228
0:12:40,233 --> 0:12:42,9
(applause)


229
0:12:42,9 --> 0:12:43,734
We shouldn't be doing that.


230
0:12:43,734 --> 0:13:2,7
(applause)


231
0:13:2,7 --> 0:13:6,533
These so-called "right to work"
laws, they don't have to do with


232
0:13:6,533 --> 0:13:8,7
economics; they have
everything to do with politics.


233
0:13:8,7 --> 0:13:11,567
(applause)


234
0:13:11,567 --> 0:13:14,33
What they're really talking
about is giving you the right


235
0:13:14,33 --> 0:13:15,3
to work for less money.


236
0:13:15,3 --> 0:13:19,5
(applause)


237
0:13:19,5 --> 0:13:22,633
You only have to look to
Michigan -- where workers were


238
0:13:22,633 --> 0:13:26,166
instrumental in reviving the
auto industry -- to see how


239
0:13:26,166 --> 0:13:29,33
unions have helped build not
just a stronger middle class


240
0:13:29,33 --> 0:13:30,2
but a stronger America.


241
0:13:30,2 --> 0:13:33,9
(applause)


242
0:13:33,9 --> 0:13:38,2
So folks from our state's
capital, all the way to the


243
0:13:38,2 --> 0:13:42,133
nation's capital, they should
be focused on the same thing.


244
0:13:42,133 --> 0:13:44,2
They should be working to
make sure companies like this


245
0:13:44,2 --> 0:13:50,934
manufacturer is able to
make more great products.


246
0:13:50,934 --> 0:13:52,367
That's what they
should be focused on.


247
0:13:52,367 --> 0:13:55,2
(applause)


248
0:13:55,2 --> 0:14:0,7
We don't want a
race to the bottom.


249
0:14:0,7 --> 0:14:2,0
We want a race to the top.


250
0:14:2,0 --> 0:14:9,767
(applause)


251
0:14:9,767 --> 0:14:15,66
America is not going to compete
based on low-skill, low-wage,


252
0:14:15,66 --> 0:14:17,166
no workers' rights.


253
0:14:17,166 --> 0:14:19,667
That's not our
competitive advantage.


254
0:14:19,667 --> 0:14:23,166
There's always going to be
some other country that can


255
0:14:23,166 --> 0:14:27,9
treat its workers even worse.


256
0:14:27,9 --> 0:14:28,567
Right?


257
0:14:28,567 --> 0:14:29,467
Audience:
Right!


258
0:14:29,467 --> 0:14:31,633
The President:
What's going to make us
succeed is we got the best


259
0:14:31,633 --> 0:14:36,166
workers -- well trained,
reliable, productive,


260
0:14:36,166 --> 0:14:40,2
low turnover, healthy.


261
0:14:40,2 --> 0:14:42,0
That's what makes us strong.


262
0:14:42,0 --> 0:14:47,6
And it also is what allows our
workers then to buy the products


263
0:14:47,6 --> 0:14:50,5
that we make because they got
enough money in their pockets.


264
0:14:50,5 --> 0:14:58,3
(applause)


265
0:14:58,3 --> 0:15:3,7
So we've got to get past
this whole situation where


266
0:15:3,7 --> 0:15:7,633
we manufacture crises
because of politics.


267
0:15:7,633 --> 0:15:11,767
That actually leads to less
certainty, more conflict,


268
0:15:11,767 --> 0:15:15,0
and we can't all focus on
coming together to grow.


269
0:15:15,0 --> 0:15:17,2
Audience Member:
That's right!


270
0:15:17,2 --> 0:15:19,967
The President:
And the same thing --
we're seeing the same


271
0:15:19,967 --> 0:15:21,9
thing in Washington.


272
0:15:21,9 --> 0:15:24,667
I'm sure you've all heard the
talk recently about some big


273
0:15:24,667 --> 0:15:27,934
deadlines we're facing in a few
weeks when it comes to decisions


274
0:15:27,934 --> 0:15:31,5
on jobs and
investment and taxes.


275
0:15:31,5 --> 0:15:36,33
And that debate is going to
have a big impact on all of you.


276
0:15:36,33 --> 0:15:39,333
Some of you may know this:
If Congress doesn't act soon,


277
0:15:39,333 --> 0:15:45,433
meaning in the next few weeks,
starting on January 1st,


278
0:15:45,433 --> 0:15:47,8
everybody is going to see
their income taxes go up.


279
0:15:47,8 --> 0:15:49,667
Audience:
No!


280
0:15:49,667 --> 0:15:51,367
The President:
It's true.


281
0:15:51,367 --> 0:15:52,233
You all don't like that.


282
0:15:52,233 --> 0:15:54,667
Audience:
No!


283
0:15:54,667 --> 0:15:58,333
The President:
Typical, middle-class family of
four will see an income tax hike


284
0:15:58,333 --> 0:16:1,633
of around $2,200.


285
0:16:1,633 --> 0:16:5,9
How many of you can afford to
pay another $2,200 in taxes?


286
0:16:5,9 --> 0:16:6,533
Not you?


287
0:16:6,533 --> 0:16:7,567
Audience:
No!


288
0:16:7,567 --> 0:16:9,633
The President:
I didn't think so.


289
0:16:9,633 --> 0:16:12,433
You can't afford
to lose that money.


290
0:16:12,433 --> 0:16:14,7
That's a hit you
can't afford to take.


291
0:16:14,7 --> 0:16:18,233
And, by the way, that's not a
good hit for businesses, either


292
0:16:18,233 --> 0:16:22,1
-- because if Congress lets
middle-class taxes go up,


293
0:16:22,1 --> 0:16:25,767
economists will tell you that
means people will spend nearly


294
0:16:25,767 --> 0:16:30,934
$200 billion less than
they otherwise would spend.


295
0:16:30,934 --> 0:16:33,467
Consumer spending
is going to go down.


296
0:16:33,467 --> 0:16:35,867
That means you've
got less customers.


297
0:16:35,867 --> 0:16:38,367
Businesses get fewer profits.


298
0:16:38,367 --> 0:16:40,133
They hire fewer workers.


299
0:16:40,133 --> 0:16:42,867
You go in a downward spiral.


300
0:16:42,867 --> 0:16:43,9
Wrong idea.


301
0:16:43,9 --> 0:16:48,533
Here is the good news: We
can solve this problem.


302
0:16:48,533 --> 0:16:52,7
All Congress needs to do is pass
a law that would prevent a tax


303
0:16:52,7 --> 0:16:58,133
hike on the first $250,000 of
everybody's income -- everybody.


304
0:16:58,133 --> 0:17:3,633
(applause)


305
0:17:3,633 --> 0:17:8,367
That means 98 percent of
Americans -- and probably 100


306
0:17:8,367 --> 0:17:11,266
percent of you -- (laughter)


307
0:17:11,266 --> 0:17:13,9
-- 97 percent of small
businesses wouldn't see


308
0:17:13,9 --> 0:17:17,133
their income taxes
go up a single dime.


309
0:17:17,133 --> 0:17:20,0
Even the wealthiest Americans
would still get a tax cut on the


310
0:17:20,0 --> 0:17:23,533
first $250,000 of their income.


311
0:17:23,533 --> 0:17:28,166
But when they start making
a million, or $10 million,


312
0:17:28,166 --> 0:17:32,6
or $20 million you can afford
to pay a little bit more.


313
0:17:32,6 --> 0:17:34,133
(applause)


314
0:17:34,133 --> 0:17:40,467
You're not too strapped.


315
0:17:40,467 --> 0:17:43,1
So Congress can
do that right now.


316
0:17:43,1 --> 0:17:44,633
Everybody says
they agree with it.


317
0:17:44,633 --> 0:17:45,7
Let's get it done.


318
0:17:45,7 --> 0:17:48,767
(applause)


319
0:17:48,767 --> 0:17:52,233
So that's the bare minimum.


320
0:17:52,233 --> 0:17:54,633
That's the bare minimum we
should be doing in order to


321
0:17:54,633 --> 0:17:55,633
the grow the economy.


322
0:17:55,633 --> 0:17:57,166
But we can do more.


323
0:17:57,166 --> 0:18:0,867
We can do more than just
extend middle-class tax cuts.


324
0:18:0,867 --> 0:18:6,934
I've said I will work with
Republicans on a plan for


325
0:18:6,934 --> 0:18:11,567
economic growth, job creation,
and reducing our deficits.


326
0:18:11,567 --> 0:18:13,4
And that has some
compromise between


327
0:18:13,4 --> 0:18:14,6
Democrats and Republicans.


328
0:18:14,6 --> 0:18:18,433
I understand people have
a lot of different views.


329
0:18:18,433 --> 0:18:21,266
I'm willing to
compromise a little bit.


330
0:18:21,266 --> 0:18:23,767
But if we're serious about
reducing our deficit,


331
0:18:23,767 --> 0:18:25,834
we've also got to be serious
about investing in the things


332
0:18:25,834 --> 0:18:28,3
that help us grow and make
the middle class strong,


333
0:18:28,3 --> 0:18:31,533
like education, and
research and development,


334
0:18:31,533 --> 0:18:34,667
and making sure kids can go
to college, and rebuilding our


335
0:18:34,667 --> 0:18:36,767
roads and our infrastructure.


336
0:18:36,767 --> 0:18:37,467
(applause)


337
0:18:37,467 --> 0:18:39,433
We've got to do that.


338
0:18:39,433 --> 0:18:44,133
So when you put it all together,
what you need is a package that


339
0:18:44,133 --> 0:18:48,9
keeps taxes where they are for
middle-class families; we make


340
0:18:48,9 --> 0:18:52,166
some tough spending cuts on
things that we don't need;


341
0:18:52,166 --> 0:18:54,567
and then we ask the wealthiest
Americans to pay a slightly


342
0:18:54,567 --> 0:18:56,734
higher tax rate.


343
0:18:56,734 --> 0:19:0,1
And that's a principle I won't
compromise on, because I'm not


344
0:19:0,1 --> 0:19:4,934
going to have a situation
where the wealthiest among us,


345
0:19:4,934 --> 0:19:8,66
including folks like me, get
to keep all our tax breaks,


346
0:19:8,66 --> 0:19:13,5
and then we're asking students
to pay higher student loans.


347
0:19:13,5 --> 0:19:19,6
Or suddenly, a school doesn't
have schoolbooks because the


348
0:19:19,6 --> 0:19:22,233
school district
couldn't afford it.


349
0:19:22,233 --> 0:19:25,7
Or some family that has a
disabled kid isn't getting


350
0:19:25,7 --> 0:19:28,7
the help that they
need through Medicaid.


351
0:19:28,7 --> 0:19:29,7
We're not going to do that.


352
0:19:29,7 --> 0:19:30,834
We're not going to
make that tradeoff.


353
0:19:30,834 --> 0:19:33,834
That's not going
to help us to grow.


354
0:19:33,834 --> 0:19:37,33
Our economic success has never
come from the top down; it comes


355
0:19:37,33 --> 0:19:38,567
from the middle out.


356
0:19:38,567 --> 0:19:39,7
It comes from the bottom up.


357
0:19:39,7 --> 0:19:40,934
(applause)


358
0:19:40,934 --> 0:19:45,2
It comes from folks like you
working hard, and if you're


359
0:19:45,2 --> 0:19:47,667
working hard and you're
successful, then you become


360
0:19:47,667 --> 0:19:51,467
customers and
everybody does well.


361
0:19:51,467 --> 0:19:55,633
Our success as a country in this
new century will be defined by


362
0:19:55,633 --> 0:19:58,9
how well we educate our kids,
how well we train our workers,


363
0:19:58,9 --> 0:20:2,734
how well we invent, how well
we innovate, how well we build


364
0:20:2,734 --> 0:20:6,367
things like cars and engines
-- all the things that helped


365
0:20:6,367 --> 0:20:9,233
create the greatest middle
class the world has ever known.


366
0:20:9,233 --> 0:20:11,1
That's how you bring new
jobs back to Detroit.


367
0:20:11,1 --> 0:20:14,6
That's how you bring good
jobs back to America.


368
0:20:14,6 --> 0:20:16,0
That's what I'm focused on.


369
0:20:16,0 --> 0:20:18,467
That's what I will stay
relentlessly focused on


370
0:20:18,467 --> 0:20:19,767
going forward.


371
0:20:19,767 --> 0:20:20,467
(applause)


372
0:20:20,467 --> 0:20:24,433
Because when we focus on these
things -- when we stay true to


373
0:20:24,433 --> 0:20:28,333
ourselves and our history,
there's nothing we can't do.


374
0:20:28,333 --> 0:20:30,467
(applause)


375
0:20:30,467 --> 0:20:33,4
And if you don't believe me, you
need to come down to this plant


376
0:20:33,4 --> 0:20:36,66
and see all these
outstanding workers.


377
0:20:36,66 --> 0:20:40,33
In fact, as I was coming over
here, I was hearing about a guy


378
0:20:40,33 --> 0:20:40,934
named Willie.


379
0:20:40,934 --> 0:20:42,133
(applause)


380
0:20:42,133 --> 0:20:43,967
Where's Willie?


381
0:20:43,967 --> 0:20:47,734
There's Willie right here.


382
0:20:47,734 --> 0:20:48,567
There's Willie.


383
0:20:48,567 --> 0:21:2,667
(applause)


384
0:21:2,667 --> 0:21:6,133
Now, in case you haven't heard
of him, they actually call him


385
0:21:6,133 --> 0:21:6,967
"Pretty Willie."


386
0:21:6,967 --> 0:21:10,4
(laughter)


387
0:21:10,4 --> 0:21:14,166
Now, I got to say you got to be
pretty tough to have a nickname


388
0:21:14,166 --> 0:21:15,2
like "Pretty Willie."


389
0:21:15,2 --> 0:21:18,0
(laughter)


390
0:21:18,0 --> 0:21:20,7
He's tough.


391
0:21:20,7 --> 0:21:25,533
On Wednesday, Willie will
celebrate 60 years working at


392
0:21:25,533 --> 0:21:27,734
Detroit Diesel -- 60 years.


393
0:21:27,734 --> 0:21:40,433
(applause)


394
0:21:40,433 --> 0:21:45,33
Willie started back
on December 12, 1952.


395
0:21:45,33 --> 0:21:46,2
I was not born yet.


396
0:21:46,2 --> 0:21:49,2
(laughter)


397
0:21:49,2 --> 0:21:52,1
Wasn't even close to being born.


398
0:21:52,1 --> 0:21:56,1
He made $1.40 an hour.


399
0:21:56,1 --> 0:21:59,0
The only time he spent away
from this plant was when he


400
0:21:59,0 --> 0:22:1,1
was serving our country
in the Korean War.


401
0:22:1,1 --> 0:22:11,3
(applause)


402
0:22:11,3 --> 0:22:13,867
So three generations of Willie's
family have passed through


403
0:22:13,867 --> 0:22:15,6
Detroit Diesel.


404
0:22:15,6 --> 0:22:18,0
One of his daughters works
here with him right now --


405
0:22:18,0 --> 0:22:18,967
is that right?


406
0:22:18,967 --> 0:22:19,7
There she is.


407
0:22:19,7 --> 0:22:23,834
(applause)


408
0:22:23,834 --> 0:22:30,3
In all his years, Willie has
been late to work only once.


409
0:22:30,3 --> 0:22:31,9
It was back in 1977.


410
0:22:31,9 --> 0:22:34,533
(laughter)


411
0:22:34,533 --> 0:22:37,2
It's been so long he can't
remember why he was late --


412
0:22:37,2 --> 0:22:40,266
(laughter and applause)


413
0:22:40,266 --> 0:22:43,934
-- but we're willing
to give him a pass.


414
0:22:43,934 --> 0:22:46,767
So Willie believes in hard work.


415
0:22:46,767 --> 0:22:50,4
You don't keep a job for 60
years if you don't work hard.


416
0:22:50,4 --> 0:22:52,33
Sooner or later, someone is
going to fire you if you don't


417
0:22:52,33 --> 0:22:54,266
work hard.


418
0:22:54,266 --> 0:22:59,8
He takes pride in being part of
something bigger than himself.


419
0:22:59,8 --> 0:23:3,1
He's committed to family; he's
committed to community; he's


420
0:23:3,1 --> 0:23:4,934
committed to country.


421
0:23:4,934 --> 0:23:7,8
That's how Willie
lives his life.


422
0:23:7,8 --> 0:23:10,2
That's how all of
you live your lives.


423
0:23:10,2 --> 0:23:15,667
And that makes me hopeful about
the future, because you're out


424
0:23:15,667 --> 0:23:18,1
there fighting every day for a
better future for your family


425
0:23:18,1 --> 0:23:20,166
and your country.


426
0:23:20,166 --> 0:23:27,33
And when you do that, that means
you're creating value all across


427
0:23:27,33 --> 0:23:28,533
this economy.


428
0:23:28,533 --> 0:23:30,33
You're inspiring people.


429
0:23:30,33 --> 0:23:33,2
You're being a good
example for your kids.


430
0:23:33,2 --> 0:23:34,7
That's what makes America great.


431
0:23:34,7 --> 0:23:37,33
That's what we have
to stay focused on.


432
0:23:37,33 --> 0:23:39,266
And as long as I've got the
privilege of serving as your


433
0:23:39,266 --> 0:23:42,7
President, I'm going to
keep fighting for you.


434
0:23:42,7 --> 0:23:44,433
I'm going to keep
fighting for your kids.


435
0:23:44,433 --> 0:23:48,467
I'm going to keep fighting for
an America where anybody, no


436
0:23:48,467 --> 0:23:51,767
matter who you are, no matter
what you look like, no matter


437
0:23:51,767 --> 0:23:54,166
where you come from,
you can make it if you


438
0:23:54,166 --> 0:23:55,734
try here in America.


439
0:23:55,734 --> 0:23:56,3
(applause)


440
0:23:56,3 --> 0:23:57,3
Thank you very much, everybody.


441
0:23:57,3 --> 0:23:58,0
God bless you.


442
0:23:58,0 --> 0:25:58,0
(applause)
