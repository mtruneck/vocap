###3 You ever notice how a tumour looks just like cheese?
###5 ls that good cocktail conversation?
###7 This patient today thought he had blood in his stool.
###10 Turned out to be pimento.
###14 What? l worked on a homeless guy who vomited up a mitten.
###17 That won't stop me from wearing mine when it's cold.
###20 What's wrong with you? We have a good bottle of wine, we all look nice.
###24 Can we talk about something other than work? Please?
###29 Name an actress.
###31 JD can tell you which movie she appeared in naked.
###33 l'm gonna go put on my pyjamas.
###36 Can't believe l shaved my legs for this.
###38 Drew Barrymore, Meg Ryan, Jennifer Connelly.
###40 <i>Boys on the Side The Doors</i> and as for Ms Connelly,
###43 topless in <i>Inventing the Abbotts</i> bottomless in <i>Requiem For a Dream</i>
###46 and in <i>The Hot Spot</i> you gotta love her,
###48 frontal and tush-tush.
###51 - Oh, my God! - You the man.
###54 <i>That's the thing about</i> <i>best friends, They just get each other,</i>
###58 You usually get uncomfortable hugging a guy right about now.
###62 Bring it, baby.
###63 This isn't gonna end well. l used to wrestle in college.
###69 Oh! You broke the hug!
###71 So you working on a house or what?
###73 Yeah, l scored this big restoration job.
###77 So who's the fan club?
###79 Neat hug.
###80 Newbie, no one likes a looky-loo.
###83 Not now, not ever.
###85 What's that, your lucky board or something?
###87 That? Oh, that's a nail gun accident.
###89 Oh, my God, that's disgusting.
###91 l dosed him with morphine, and the nail went straight through,
###95 so it's not that big a d...
###96 Dear God, she's getting woozy. Quickly, show her the bloody side.
###99 - Look. Touch the nail. - Yeah!
###101 Wanna touch it? Touch the nail. Touch my nail! Touch it!
###105 - Lick the tip of my... - Good night!
###108 - Let's get you to a hand surgeon. - What about tough guy?
###111 Somebody'll get her.
###115 - Bye-bye. - Please don't.
###131 l can't get over it. Who faints? No one's fainted since the '40s.
###134 You're a doctor. You shouldn't have to look at that stuff.
###137 l was surprised. l don't like surprises.
###139 Oh, my goodness!
###142 Pictures capture moments in time.
###146 When they're posed, they're not real. l hate that whole, like... thing.
###151 That's why at a party, you see me in the bushes with my camera.
###154 - You're a little weird, aren't you? - A little bit.
###157 Ben, look what the cat tried to drag in before it was skinned and eaten.
###160 Meow.
###162 Still with the annoying camera?
###164 She just skip the part where people say hello to each other?
###168 Hello, Benji. You look very pale.
###171 l miss the sweet talk.
###173 Maybe it's been too long. Maybe my feelings were hurt a little.
###176 ''Feelings.'' That's a good one.
###178 You're a big girl. When you got divorced,
###180 you put people in the awkward position of choosing between you and Perry.
###184 You're my brother!
###186 Well, admittedly, that made it harder. Ooh, good one!
###190 ''Me so cranky!''
###194 Patient's name is Mo Weinberg. Cancer is confined to the right testicle.
###198 Dr Turk will be assisting with the removal.
###201 Sorry, Mo. Looks like you're about to lose Larry or Curly.
###205 Starting the incision.
###207 Wait, wait. Stop, stop. l'm guessing Mr Weinberg is Jewish.
###211 - Yeah, so? - Why isn't he circumcised?
###215 <i>A recent medical study found</i>
###217 <i>that a mistake is made</i> <i>on 20 percent of all patients,</i>
###220 <i>Most of these</i> <i>are clerical and harmless</i>
###222 <i>but it still adds up</i> <i>to a lot of near misses,</i>
###224 Dr Wen asks if there could be a mix-up,
###226 because our appendicitis patient, that dude doesn't have an appendix.
###230 Oh, wait right here.
###233 Wow.
###235 l know. You know, we almost did... Whoa!
###238 What's goin' on here?
###241 No, Mom, l don't care what my third grade teacher is up to.
###249 And scene. How are you?
###251 l haven't seen you since your breakdown.
###253 Oh, which one?
###257 Oh. So...
###259 What's new?
###261 Last time l saw you l was really stressed.
###263 The weight of the world on my shoulders.
###265 - So guess what l did. - Quit your job?
###267 Flushed my fish down the toilet. No more feedings, no more bowl cleaning,
###271 no more being judged for having a second glass of wine.
###274 Don't even get me started on judgmental fish.
###276 But that sent me on this whole shame spiral, so l decided to travel.
###280 l got hit on in Venice. l climbed Mount Kilimanjaro.
###283 For about ten minutes. lt's very steep.
###285 Then l went to Florida to swim with Dolphins.
###287 - Oh. - And l don't mean the fish.
###289 There was an NFL thing going on at the hotel.
###292 - You. - l almost forgot! l'm engaged!
###295 There used to be a ring, but my fiancé did some soul-searching
###298 and we decided that it needed to be a little more fancy.
###302 Oh, you have no idea how happy this makes me.
###305 The only reason you're vomiting and exhausted is...
###307 Well, you're pregnant.
###310 N... l'm what now?
###312 Yeah, pregnant! Your fiancé's gonna be so happy!
###315 My fiancé and l decided not to have sex until we were married.
###319 So he's not gonna be so happy.
###321 More curious, really, than happy.
###325 You'll want to rewrap the gauze when it gets soiled.
###328 Rewrap a dirty bandage. lt's phenomenal
###330 how you doctors keep all this in your head.
###332 We don't. lt says it right there on the box.
###334 Look, right there. Hey, don't be mean to him. You're mad at me.
###338 You shouldn't do contracting. You're clumsy. That's why these things happen.
###342 They don't.
###343 How many times have you hurt yourself with that nail gun?
###346 - Once. What? - Oh, come on.
###348 That's a new nail gun. lf it'd been any other,
###350 the estimate would be slightly higher.
###352 lt's not funny.
###354 You're pretty when you're mad.
###356 <i>I guess sibling rivalry never goes away</i> <i>no matter how old you get,</i>
###360 What is this? That doesn't hurt.
###363 - Doesn't hurt. Doesn't hurt. - Oh, really?
###368 OK, that kind of smarts a little bit.
###375 - Jordan, l'll call later. All right? - OK. Fine. Forget it. Forget it.
###380 You big jerk.
###382 You happen to remember when she used to be fun?
###384 - No. - Me neither.
###386 Me neither.
###387 When spoken to, newbie. When spoken to.
###390 l thought we were clear on that one.
###393 We haven't grabbed a beer in weeks. What's that about?
###396 <i>He's never asked me</i> <i>to grab a beer but I don't care,</i>
###399 Would you like to come?
###401 Oh, God, yes.
###402 To buddies!
###404 What do you think you're doing?
###406 You can't drink. You're our driver. That's why we brought you.
###409 That's just not right.
###411 Well, l'm gonna drink this for both of us.
###417 Can't stop thinking about Mr Weinberg's testicles.
###420 Dude.
###422 l mean, l almost removed one of them, Todd.
###425 - Which one? - Like it matters.
###427 Oh, it matters.
###428 - Bye, Todd. - OK!
###430 Dr Turk, l heard about your mishap earlier today,
###433 but here's the skinny.
###435 lf that patient finds out what happened because you can't rein in your yapper,
###438 then heads will roll, and l promise,
###441 yours and Ted's will be the first to go!
###443 What did l do?
###445 Consider my lips sewn shut, sir. Which, in this hospital, could happen.
###449 Young man!
###451 At Sacred Heart, we do not make mistakes.
###455 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
###459 l wouldn't have slept with someone else
###461 if l didn't love you so much.
###463 No, no, no, no, no! Stop! Hang up the phone!
###466 Hold on one second. Hold on! Hi!
###470 Your last name is Tracy! Of course you know that,
###473 but there's a woman in 308 whose first name is Tracy.
###476 l started thinking about your urine and how you stay well-hydrated,
###480 which is why your pee is lighter than most people's,
###483 and the sample with your name on was bright yellow,
###485 and the other Tracy is not much of a water drinker,
###488 which is why l think her skin looks so pasty.
###490 Get to the point.
###492 You're not pregnant! The lab tech just switched the samples.
###497 You're killin' me.
###499 Hey, sweetie, you know l was joking about all that stuff, right?

###515 Oh, chalk boy?
###517 ''Chalk boy.''
###520 lf you could chalk it without pleasuring it, that'd be terrific.
###526 What?
###527 You're going for that gruff doctor routine,
###529 but you just come off sounding like a cartoon pirate.
###532 ''Gladys. Chalk it! Don't pleasure it!''

###540 Yeah, l'm done.

###557 That's just great.
###560 Hey, Ben, what...
###562 Why is this hand still bleeding?
###564 l don't know.
###566 lt's weird. l cut myself shaving last week
###568 and it wouldn't stop bleeding.
###571 <i>One thing that</i> <i>sucks about being a doctor</i>

###583 - Yeah. - Score.
###585 Your only job today is to get his test results back, you understand?
###589 Hey, guys!
###591 See, now that's real.
###593 She wasn't pregnant after all. Some idiot mislabelled her sample.
###597 l was a heartbeat away from giving an appendix patient a crotch lobotomy.
###601 lf l do my best and l lose a patient. l can live with that.

###769 You're gonna write an angry note? She doesn't deserve it.
###772 - l lost my thesaurus. - You go get her then.

###778 Hi, how... Could you check, there's a very important file l...
###782 You know what? This actually means, ''in a minute.''
###784 Tag me in. l am oiled-up and ready to go.
###787 She said a minute, so l'm sure that in a minute...
###790 Now it's two. You're in.
###791 Thank you. My friend needs you to check on the Ben Sullivan file,
###795 and you're gonna do it right now. Why?
###798 Because you are not gonna drop the ball like you did on my patient.
###801 - You said, ''Drop the ball.'' - l know, totally by accident.

###817 These aren't my words.
###820 Hello, Dr Dorian. Let's take a ride.
###824 So, word has it you've been doing a little fishing in these here parts,
###828 trying to catch yourself a prize-winning mistake.
###831 No, sir, l just...
###832 l was sure your little buddy in Surgery
###835 would've shared with you my most important rule here at Sacred Heart.
###839 Tell him my most important rule, Ted.
###841 Too much ''ha-ha,'' pretty soon ''boo-hoo.''
###845 My other rule.
###847 lf you don't look for a mistake, you can't find one.
###852 That's right, Teddy bear.
###854 Now, stop looking for trouble
###858 just because you like this patient, and face the facts.
###862 Remove him, Ted.
###867 That ''ha-ha'' rule is true.
###870 l'm just asking you to check and see if you could've made a mistake.
###874 ln seven years, l've never made a mistake.
###877 You mixed up my patients' urine samples yesterday!
###880 l make lots of mistakes. But l have to go to the bathroom now.
###883 - After that, l'm going to lunch. - Franklyn...
###887 - Can you help me out here? - What do you want me to do, cry?
###891 - Can you do that? - Sure.
###892 Give me a second to think of something sad.
###896 - Quickly. - OK, that's not helping.
###898 l shouldn't have put you in this position.
###901 Oh, there we go. Another man in my life, trying to protect me.
###904 Stay with it, Elliot.
###905 Everyone thinks l can't take criticism
###908 because mom and dad give nothing but.
###910 - Good, this is good. - Look where it's gotten me.
###912 You know, l'm 26, single and all l do is work.
###916 You know, l may as well just give up the idea of being in a healthy and...
###920 ...happy relationship and just go ahead and...
###923 And... And...
###926 Become your mother?
###928 Yeah.
###932 Check Mr Sullivan's tests again.
###935 OK.
###940 How cool was that?
###942 Why so sad, Bambi?
###944 Because so far no one's screwed up.
###946 The clerk didn't make a mistake, or the lab technician.
###950 Maybe l'm just an idiot. l don't know.
###952 Let me ask you something.
###956 You're kind of a boob guy, right?
###958 Excuse me?
###959 l can tell. l've seen you look at mine. Not in a sleazy way, or anything.
###963 This is the most uncomfortable conversation l've had.
###965 - You want to touch one? - l stand corrected.
###967 You're my best friend's girlfriend.
###969 So your instinct is to pass on this fantastic one-time offer?
###974 - l'm afraid so. - l'm up here, Bambi.
###976 Oh, sorry.
###978 With Ben, it's one of two things.
###980 Either your instincts are right or your brain
###982 is trying to protect you from something.
###984 You have pretty good instincts. Trust them.
###987 What am l supposed to do though?
###990 You know there's only one more person to talk to.
###992 <i>The haematopathologist,</i>

###1000 - Nope. First name's Fred. - Fred Bobb?

###1004 Hi, l was hoping that you could recheck Ben Sullivan's blood smear.
###1007 Well that depends, young man.
###1009 Do you think l made a mistake or do you just wish l did?
###1012 - l kind of wish you did. - Then l'll do it.
###1019 Sorry there, giant '70s security guard guy.
###1023 - Cold out here, huh? - Yes.
###1025 Yeah. You could hang a friggin' raincoat off my nipples.
###1028 Left one at least. The right one's just a little shy.
###1031 - Sticking with the weird thing? - lt works for me.

###1038 if there wasn't something potentially wrong with me, would you?
###1042 No, we wouldn't.

###1049 - Oh, my God. - Him.
###1052 Want to see the rest of the pictures l took today?
###1057 - Look at that one. - These are good, man.
