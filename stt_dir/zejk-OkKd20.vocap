###1 DAVID MACMILLAN: I hate when fucking people send me
###2 reservations on the fucking phone.
###5 Because they've called Liverpool House, they've
###7 called Joe Beef, they've been on OpenTable.
###9 
###14 You really have to dig around to find my email.
###17 You have to be a bit psycho.
###19 And then you call me and say, we'd like to be eight people
###21 on Saturday night at 7 o'clock.
###23 It's like, dude.
###25 Fuck off.
###27 [LAUGHTER]
###28 
###45 DAVID MACMILLAN: My name is David McMillan, and I'm part
###48 owners of Joe Beef with my partner Fred and Allison.
###51 Fred's like my brother.
###53 We're peas in a pod.
###54 
###56 We think the same way for some reason.
###57 We like the same things.
###59 We like the same aesthetic and food.
###61 When we look at a space to open a restaurant, it's not
###64 about, hey, we found a space.
###65 Let's open this modern restaurant in it.
###67 It's about, what was it like in this
###69 neighborhood 100 years ago?
###71 What will it be like in 100 years from now?
###73 You try to put on the shoe that looks nice with the jean.
###76 You know what I'm saying?
###78 This neighborhood, I felt, needed that oyster place where
###82 you can have a nice piece of meat.
###85 I didn't want it to have a New World wine program.
###87 I want an Old World wine program.
###88 I only want French wine.
###91 I want to work from the Market.
###93 We're right near Atwater Market.
###94 It's important that we work with Atwater Market, to fit
###97 into the community that's Little Burgundy
###99 and to make it stronger.
###101 Fred's strong, strong, strong, strong in the kitchen.
###104 Whereas I think I'm a bit stronger, perhaps, in the room
###107 with the people.
###108 I've got the chat, the gift of the gab, perhaps.
###112 Can you not do ice right now, when I'm fucking
###114 talking on a camera?
###116 VOICE (OFFSCREEN): Sorry man.
###117 DAVID MACMILLAN: Sorry, dude.
###117 I didn't know it was you.
###119 I want to move pleasantries aside quickly and just get to
###123 first name basis as quick as possible.
###127 Let's get to know each other real quick and have drinks.
###129 That's the thing, I think.
###130 Oh, it's [INAUDIBLE].
###131 What do you want?
###134 Eh?
###135 They've got to live it up a little bit, eh?
###137 [FRENCH].
###139 
###140 When you write a menu, and it's fixed, and it says green
###143 peas on it-- there's not always
###145 green peas at the market.
###147 So working on the chalkboard and changing the menu often,
###149 it's something that's rampant now.
###152 It's just a way of working closer
###155 with the Market, really.
###157 Vanya might as well well be my--
###159 she's my business partner, but not my business partner.
###162 For all practical purposes, she should have been.
###164 And Marco, at his age, has an incredible amount of talent.
###168 And he has his own voice in the kitchen already.
###170 We can both see that, Fred and I.
###172 MARC-OLIVIER FRAPPIER: Dessert is basically a pavlova shaped
###175 as a baked potato.
###177 Meringue, parfait, ganache, rum and water.
###180 And soft serve.
###182 Fake orange cheese, carrot puree with gelatin.
###185 Mint.
###186 Hot chocolate sauce.
###187 There you go.
###188 DAVID MACMILLAN: It'd be nice to see Marco develop, perhaps
###191 under Fred's watchful eye, for a couple of years to come.
###193 But he'll definitely be a very successful
###197 and very young chef.
###198 Let's get the [INAUDIBLE] out of here.
###200 
###206 MARC-OLIVIER FRAPPIER: So where is Fred?
###207 DAVID MACMILLAN: Fred put a nail in his hand.
###209 MARC-OLIVIER FRAPPIER: Oh, yeah.
###209 MARC-OLIVIER FRAPPIER: Right?
###210 VANYA FILIPOVIC: Oh my god.
###211 MARC-OLIVIER FRAPPIER: And then he got a blood infection.
###212 MARC-OLIVIER FRAPPIER: Yeah.
###213 DAVID MACMILLAN: He's had to go to hospital every day for
###215 five days and take an IV drip.
###217 MARC-OLIVIER FRAPPIER: So that's why
###217 he's not here today.
###218 DAVID MACMILLAN: So we're going to Park, Antonio Park's
###223 restaurant.
###224 And we're going to have some Korean pickles.
###227 Or maybe four slices of tuna.
###231 I love sushi.
###232 It's my favorite food.
###233 I like raw fish and crabs and seafood.
###237 Antonio just brings a different thing to it.
###239 He always has creative takes and tasty flavors.
###242 He's an interesting character.
###244 He's a kind of funny boy.
###245 ANTONIO PARK: Hi, my name is Antonio Park, and this is my
###247 restaurant, Park.
###248 I do, let's say, cuisines de marche, so market food.
###252 But influenced with my own cultures, which is
###254 Argentinian, Japanese, Korean.
###257 It's all mixed up.
###257 But we take the source and just bring it all
###260 together in one plate.
###262 Dave is difficult.
###264 But there's certain things that he likes, and you just
###266 have to focus on those things that he likes.
###268 Like albacore tuna.
###269 He likes pickles.
###270 He like greens, vegetables, and all the other that comes
###273 out of the ground.
###274 DAVID MACMILLAN: That's an excellent [INAUDIBLE].
###275 ANTONIO PARK: That's who he is.
###276 That's who he is.
###279 DAVID MACMILLAN: So what is this, buddy?
###280 ANTONIO PARK: So it's topside albacore.
###283 Topside albacore tuna, sashimi on top of it.
###285 And then you have, underneath, you have a kimchi coleslaw.
###288 DAVID MACMILLAN: Antonio, for real, this is delicious.
###290 ANTONIO PARK: Thank you.
###290 VANYA FILIPOVIC: Do you eat kimchi any
###291 other time than here?
###292 DAVID MACMILLAN: Yeah.
###293 I love Korean food.
###296 That's it, we're leaving.
###298 ANTONIO PARK: One more, one more slice.
###299 DAVID MACMILLAN: No, no, no.
###299 We're leaving.
###299 ANTONIO PARK: One more [INAUDIBLE].
###301 DAVID MACMILLAN: No.
###301 ANTONIO PARK: One more.
###303 Lobster and chorizo.
###305 Argentinian-style.
###306 DAVID MACMILLAN: Argentinian-style?
###307 ANTONIO PARK: Yup.
###308 DAVID MACMILLAN: He's good.
###310 I always enjoy eating there.
###312 He's a sweet kid.
###314 The Argentinian-Korean maniac.
###318 I love you.
###318 ANTONIO PARK: I love you baby.
###320 VANYA FILIPOVIC: Thanks for the snack.
###321 
###324 DAVID MACMILLAN: That was just really crazy good.
###325 Thank you.
###326 ANTONIO PARK: All right.
###326 Thank you.
###328 DAVID MACMILLAN: I always tell people, you have to work hard
###330 at not burning bridges.
###334 Come on.
###335 Let's go, guys.
###336 
###340 Nora Gray.
###341 When we opened Liverpool House, and Ryan was my dining
###343 room manager, and Emma was the chef, and they worked there
###345 for six years.
###347 And in that six year period, I always said to them that one
###351 day you're going to leave here.
###352 Don't make a mistake.
###353 Leave here properly.
###354 When they opened their restaurant, they were very
###356 respectful.
###357 It doesn't look like Joe Beef.
###359 It's Ryan's own vision of the restaurant.
###361 The food doesn't seem like Joe Beef or Liverpool House food.
###365 It's Emma's own food.
###366 Some people have left here--
###368 to remain nameless--
###370 and just done Joe Beef, up in the East End, verbatim.
###375 
###378 And those guys, today, don't even exist because they don't
###384 play with all the other reindeers.
###385 RYAN GRAY: Hey, my name is Ryan Gray.
###387 I'm one of the co-owners of Nora Gray restaurant.
###390 We specialize in southern Italian food.
###394 Basically the kind of food that you wish that your mother
###396 made when you were growing up.
###399 EMMA CARDARELLI: This is a bechamel sauce
###400 with Fontina in it.
###401 It's got a lot of nutmeg.
###403 Grilled radicchio.
###404 Poached pears, which we finish off on the grill, and then we
###407 mix with parsley salad, candied walnuts, fresh ground
###411 pepper, and olive oil.
###413 RYAN GRAY: So that's tortelloni with yellow beets
###415 inside and Gorgonzola.
###417 DAVID MACMILLAN: Wow, that's gorgeous.
###418 Really beautiful [INAUDIBLE].
###422 RYAN GRAY: And this is the wild mushroom cavatelli.
###425 DAVID MACMILLAN: Wild mushrooms?
###426 RYAN GRAY: Yeah.
###427 They're totally wild.
###428 They're out of control.
###431 DAVID MACMILLAN: Ryan's always a hoot.
###432 I love sitting at the bar with Ryan.
###433 RYAN GRAY: Cheers, guys.
###436 Thank you for coming tonight.
###437 Thank you.
###438 Thank you.
###439 DAVID MACMILLAN: His life's mission is to
###440 pour wine for me.
###443 We're going to NDG.
###445 Let's go.
###446 RYAN GRAY: NDG.
###446 VANYA FILIPOVIC: NDG.
###447 No Damn Good.
###449 RYAN GRAY: NDG is a neighborhood in the West End
###452 of Montreal that was an Irish working class neighborhood, as
###458 is Little Burgundy, Griffintown.
###462 And there is one bar--
###464 DAVID MACMILLAN: Honey fucking Martin's.
###466 I'm home.
###468 RYAN GRAY: The quintessential best Irish bar in Montreal.
###473 DAVID MACMILLAN: I'd say it's the best Irish bar in Canada.
###476 There's not a bar that has better quality oil paintings
###482 of historic boxers.
###483 And all of the furniture inside Honey Martin's, to be
###486 noted, nothing has nails.
###491 It's all tongue and groove.
###492 It's an amazing bar.
###494 RYAN GRAY: Mikey!
###497 Campari soda.
###498 How about that?
###500 DAVID MACMILLAN: That's the bottle.
###501 It still has the old stamp on it.
###504 RYAN GRAY: Mikey drinks Campari nonstop.
###507 Mikey is a Campari fiend.
###509 DAVID MACMILLAN: All right.
###510 Campari sodas.
###511 RYAN GRAY: All around.
###512 
###515 DAVID MACMILLAN: Maybe we're painting the
###515 wrong picture of Montreal.
###517 I'm a proud Montrealer, but I am one of the 8% percent
###522 minority of Anglophone Montrealers.
###526 We're at Montreal's most Irish pub.
###529 And now we're going to Montreal's most London pub.
###532 I'm so fat.
###534 I can't even fit out of minivans anymore.
###536 
###544 RYAN GRAY: Dude.
###544 I did not break your phone.
###546 
###552 I did not break your phone.
###553 I did not break your phone!
###555 VANYA FILIPOVIC: Did you just break it?
###556 RYAN GRAY: No, I did not break his phone.
###558 
###561 Is it working?
###562 Tell me it's working.
###565 DAVID MACMILLAN: We're at Burgundy Lion fucking pub.
###567 It's a pub across the street from Joe Beef
###569 and Liverpool House.
###570 If you look at the bottles behind you, there's a solid
###573 scotch whisky program here.
###574 The neighborhood became a neighborhood when Toby and his
###578 partners, Paul and Jean-Michel, opened this pub.
###583 So now today, people come here for lunch, and
###585 it's full all afternoon.
###587 We come here at 3 o'clock, 4 o'clock, 5 o'clock.
###590 It's packed at 6:00.
###591 And it's packed at fucking 2:00 in the morning.
###593 Toby.
###595 We're a bit drunk, and we've been out a lot, but we're
###598 going to cut smoked meat sandwiches off the bar on a
###601 whole brisket.
###602 TOBY LYLE: All right.
###602 DAVID MACMILLAN: Are you in?
###603 TOBY LYLE: Of course.
###604 DAVID MACMILLAN: All right.
###604 TOBY LYLE: Hey, crew, let's go to Liverpool.
###605 DAVID MACMILLAN: The smoked meat sandwiches, I think, for
###608 us it's like picnic food.
###610 Who doesn't love Schwartz's?
###611 We all get excited just to drive up to that neighborhood,
###615 you get excited.
###617 We've been cooking with brisket for years
###619 and years and years.
###622 And there's nothing more beautiful than a whole brisket
###623 on a piece of wood.
###625 And slicing little sandwiches from it is delicious.
###628 Everybody gets excited, right?
###629 VOICE (OFFSCREEN): Yeah.
###630 DAVID MACMILLAN: You could bring anything out, but people
###631 are like, bah!
###632 Smoked meat sandwiches!
###633 VOICE (OFFSCREEN): Oui, monsieur!
###636 DAVID MACMILLAN: Good job, boys.
###637 Snack time.
###639 
###643 Who wants a sammie?
###645 
###649 All the old Hebrew things in Montreal are killer, like
###653 Wolinsky's, and still Moishe's.
###655 Moishe's is killer.
###656 And Schwartz's.' Or even any smoked meat, really.
###660 And people say now today, smoked meat, it's not what it
###663 used to be.
###663 Some people don't even smoke it.
###664 Blah blah blah.
###665 But I don't care.
###666 There's something about having just a smoked meat sandwich on
###669 rye bread with that yellow mustard.
###672 Smoked meat's delicious on scallops, it's delicious on
###674 liver, it's delicious with kidneys.
###677 It's delicious cold on its own with celery root.
###683 It's not just a sandwich stuffer.
###685 We cook it, we do the Joe Beef--
###686 the liver with a slice of smoked meat on it, and three
###689 little slices of pickles.
###690 It's wonderful food.
###691 
###694 Smoked meat's the best meat.
###695 
###699 RYAN GRAY: I don't know any better meat.
###703 DAVID MACMILLAN: Out of all the meats, it's the
###704 finest of the meats.
###705 
###710 That's what Montreal is.
###711 The bagels, too.
###712 Super good.
###714 I'm always talking about that.
###716 It always comes back to those things, but it's true.
###717 Thank you everybody!
###718 [CHEERING]
###721 VOICE (OFFSCREEN): Thank you so much!
###722 DAVID MACMILLAN: Make some noise with the glasses.
###723 [CHEERING]
###727 DAVID MACMILLAN: Montreal smoked meat!
###729
