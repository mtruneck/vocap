0:0:23,758 --> 0:0:25,84
SHANE SMITH: Getting into Sudan
was really difficult.


4
0:0:25,84 --> 0:0:28,68
We had to fly to London and wait
at the Sudanese embassy.


5
0:0:28,68 --> 0:0:32,159
Our contact in Sudan had talked
to the ambassador.


6
0:0:32,159 --> 0:0:36,22
And so the ambassador had talked
to some minister that


7
0:0:36,22 --> 0:0:38,59
our contact's father
was friends with.


8
0:0:38,59 --> 0:0:39,21
So we're waiting.


9
0:0:39,21 --> 0:0:41,84
And I'm like, there's no way
this is going to happen.


10
0:0:41,84 --> 0:0:44,89
And at the 11th hour,
we got the visa.


11
0:0:44,89 --> 0:0:47,54
They said OK, got on a
plane, and then flew


12
0:0:47,54 --> 0:0:49,43
from there to Khartoum.


13
0:0:49,43 --> 0:0:53,28
And the minute you get off the
plane, you're like, what's


14
0:0:53,28 --> 0:0:54,17
happening here?


15
0:0:54,17 --> 0:0:56,52
Because everyone's
in the jalabiya.


16
0:0:56,52 --> 0:0:58,27
Everyone's got turbans.


17
0:0:58,27 --> 0:1:0,13
There's no foreign
people there.


18
0:1:0,13 --> 0:1:2,12
There's no white people there.


19
0:1:2,12 --> 0:1:7,1
It's a very deserty airport,
very empty, very hot, at least


20
0:1:7,1 --> 0:1:7,95
in the Sahara.


21
0:1:7,95 --> 0:1:10,67
Lots of security, lots
of different--


22
0:1:10,67 --> 0:1:11,34
There's the police.


23
0:1:11,34 --> 0:1:12,1
There's the army.


24
0:1:12,1 --> 0:1:13,1
There's the secret police.


25
0:1:13,1 --> 0:1:13,4
There's this.


26
0:1:13,4 --> 0:1:14,13
There's that.


27
0:1:14,13 --> 0:1:16,29
We talked to our fixer.


28
0:1:16,29 --> 0:1:18,46
And she said, oh by the way,
you might get all of your


29
0:1:18,46 --> 0:1:20,34
camera gear confiscated
and thrown in jail.


30
0:1:20,34 --> 0:1:22,4
But don't worry, I'll
get you out.


31
0:1:22,4 --> 0:1:24,14
So we were terrified the minute
we got there that we


32
0:1:24,14 --> 0:1:26,24
were going to get everything
taken away from us.


33
0:1:26,24 --> 0:1:27,92
But when we went through, it
was 4:00 in the morning.


34
0:1:27,92 --> 0:1:29,83
So they were just
tired and bored.


35
0:1:29,83 --> 0:1:31,62
So they just said, OK,
well, go through.


36
0:1:31,62 --> 0:1:34,93
Then they never checked our
bags, which was fantastic.


37
0:1:34,93 --> 0:1:38,15
We've been told that we should
get some bilaja--


38
0:1:38,15 --> 0:1:38,41
bilajabiya?


39
0:1:38,41 --> 0:1:39,28
FEMALE SPEAKER: Jalabiya.


40
0:1:39,28 --> 0:1:41,26
SHANE SMITH: Jalabiya.


41
0:1:41,26 --> 0:1:43,38
So that we fit in a
little bit more.


42
0:1:43,38 --> 0:1:45,42
We don't cause so much
consternation.


43
0:1:45,42 --> 0:1:48,51
The minute we get out of the car
here, we're the focus of a


44
0:1:48,51 --> 0:1:50,97
lot of attention because
they don't get a lot


45
0:1:50,97 --> 0:1:51,98
of foreigners here.


46
0:1:51,98 --> 0:1:53,35
They're suspicious
of foreigners.


47
0:1:53,35 --> 0:1:55,4
My pink Irish face
is not going to


48
0:1:55,4 --> 0:1:57,49
do much in a jalabiya.


49
0:1:57,49 --> 0:2:0,15
But we're going to
give it a shot.


50
0:2:0,15 --> 0:2:2,726
And we're going to check
out the market.


51
0:2:2,726 --> 0:2:4,1
JAMIE-JAMES MEDINA: It's
not as tight as I


52
0:2:4,1 --> 0:2:5,78
thought it would be.


53
0:2:5,78 --> 0:2:7,343
SHANE SMITH: Am I fitting in?


54
0:2:7,343 --> 0:2:23,873



55
0:2:23,873 --> 0:2:26,84
All of a sudden, the Sudanese
thought that was so funny, to


56
0:2:26,84 --> 0:2:29,83
see Americans dressed
up like them, that


57
0:2:29,83 --> 0:2:31,23
they were a lot nicer.


58
0:2:31,23 --> 0:2:33,52
When we had to get the press
credentials, we met the


59
0:2:33,52 --> 0:2:36,43
Secretary General of the
Ministry of Information.


60
0:2:36,43 --> 0:2:38,79
And he was dressed in the
exact same tribal garb.


61
0:2:38,79 --> 0:2:40,15
I just grabbed some stuff.


62
0:2:40,15 --> 0:2:42,59
But we had dressed in the
exact same tribal garb.


63
0:2:42,59 --> 0:2:44,82
So he loved me and
said, oh great.


64
0:2:44,82 --> 0:2:46,58
You should go to my friend
the sheikh's


65
0:2:46,58 --> 0:2:48,11
place to see a madrasa.


66
0:2:48,11 --> 0:2:50,51
The madrasa is a religious
school where you


67
0:2:50,51 --> 0:2:51,6
just learn the Koran.


68
0:2:51,6 --> 0:2:54,47
Pakistani madrasas were where
the Taliban came out of, which


69
0:2:54,47 --> 0:2:55,695
were a lot of terrorists
come out of.


70
0:2:55,695 --> 0:2:57,64
And they are an ideological
training ground for


71
0:2:57,64 --> 0:2:59,19
terrorists, et cetera,
et cetera.


72
0:2:59,19 --> 0:3:2,32
So Sudan, which is incredibly
closed towards Western media,


73
0:3:2,32 --> 0:3:5,7
and then a Sudanese madrasa
of children who have been


74
0:3:5,7 --> 0:3:10,16
orphaned by the Darfur conflict
is a huge coup.


75
0:3:10,16 --> 0:3:26,846
[SUDANESE MUSIC PLAYING]


76
0:3:26,846 --> 0:3:31,86
SHANE SMITH: A lot of the kids
from Darfur come here, and


77
0:3:31,86 --> 0:3:33,1
they get put up by the sheikh.


78
0:3:33,1 --> 0:3:35,165
And they just learn the Koran.


79
0:3:35,165 --> 0:3:35,77
That's it.


80
0:3:35,77 --> 0:3:39,152
The sheikh Is a rich guy,
but he's also a


81
0:3:39,152 --> 0:3:40,36
religious leader, right.


82
0:3:40,36 --> 0:3:42,89
Well, these kids' parents
have been slaughtered.


83
0:3:42,89 --> 0:3:46,53
He brings them and he feeds them
and clothes them, if they


84
0:3:46,53 --> 0:3:47,85
learn the Koran.


85
0:3:47,85 --> 0:3:48,56
Just the Koran.


86
0:3:48,56 --> 0:3:49,95
There's no geography.


87
0:3:49,95 --> 0:3:50,35
There's no mathematics.


88
0:3:50,35 --> 0:3:51,32
There's no foreign language.


89
0:3:51,32 --> 0:3:52,32
There's no nothing.

[SUDANESE MUSIC PLAYING]


91
0:4:14,82 --> 0:4:16,62
SHANE SMITH: So as you're
walking through there, you


92
0:4:16,62 --> 0:4:19,149
really get a chill, because
you realize the world has


93
0:4:19,149 --> 0:4:20,501
totally polarized.


94
0:4:20,501 --> 0:4:23,545
And there is Muslim world,
non-Muslim world, the rich


95
0:4:23,545 --> 0:4:24,2
world, the poor world.


96
0:4:24,2 --> 0:4:27,52
And as you walk through there,
and you see that division so


97
0:4:27,52 --> 0:4:30,158
clearly defined, it gives
you a shiver.


98
0:4:30,158 --> 0:4:31,59
And you say, wow.


99
0:4:31,59 --> 0:4:36,364
When I walked out of there,
I was blown away.


100
0:4:36,364 --> 0:4:38,24
I got back into the car.


101
0:4:38,24 --> 0:4:40,21
And there were these thousands
of kids still burned into my


102
0:4:40,21 --> 0:4:42,28
head as they were going back
and forth, back and forth.


103
0:4:42,28 --> 0:4:44,19
And a lot of times they
were looking at us.


104
0:4:44,19 --> 0:4:46,46
And they are looking
at us with hatred.


105
0:4:46,46 --> 0:4:48,294
And they're eight years old.

107

madrasa was, we went the next


108
0:5:16,1 --> 0:5:17,98
day to see the alternative.


109
0:5:17,98 --> 0:5:19,29

have had no education or

little education to get them up
to an age and a stage where


124

they can be reentered into the
regular school system.


125

kids are solvent addicts?

boys that you see around here

are living on the streets and
the market, and they are


128
0:6:11,72 --> 0:6:12,952

How do they get food?


131

132
0:6:17,11 --> 0:6:18,2
They steal.


133
0:6:18,2 --> 0:6:19,8
They come here daily for food.

0:6:19,8 --> 0:6:22,18
They get a regular meal here.


135
0:6:22,18 --> 0:6:24,647
And apart from that, they
just eat what they can


136

get from the market.


137
0:6:25,3 --> 0:6:26,53

these little boys are totally

0:9:21,912 --> 0:9:22,314
I'm not.


202
0:9:22,314 --> 0:9:24,57
And everyone in the background
is saying, yeah you are.

I could smell it.

RAZAN AHMED: He knows, because
everyone's laughing at him.

He's just trying to deny it.

SHANE SMITH: When you see kids,
it's always the heaviest


208

part, because they've
done nothing.

it's usually money.

We'd only been in Sudan a few
days, and we'd already seen

to people and see what

0:10:2,34 --> 0:10:4,7
they thought about what
was happening,

what was causing this.

SHANE SMITH: We're here at
a displaced persons camp.


221
0:10:29,8 --> 0:10:32,59
2 million people have been
displaced from the war on

4 million from

the war in the South.

They come to places like this
in the middle of the desert.


225
0:10:38,1 --> 0:10:41,97
A lot of the houses are made
from wattle and daub, from


226

manure, from hay, whatever
they can find.


227
0:10:45,9 --> 0:10:48,3
They estimate around 300,000
people live here.

And we're going to tour around
and talk to people from the

South and from Darfur about
what they've done.

night, how North America and

Europe, you get so used to
just booze, and food, and

coke, and parties,

water, food.

[SINGING SUDANESE SONG]

SHANE SMITH: We hear in America
that the conflict in


246
0:13:7,25 --> 0:13:10,84
Darfur is racial in nature,
Arab on black.


247
0:13:10,84 --> 0:13:13,79
And when we were in the IDP
camp, there were Arabs, there


248
0:13:13,79 --> 0:13:14,1
were blacks.


249
0:13:14,1 --> 0:13:17,4
There was actually 40 or 50
different tribes that all


250
0:13:17,4 --> 0:13:19,2
co-exist and that
all get along.

OLGA EUNICE ODERA: And they
are from the 25 states.


256
0:13:31,12 --> 0:13:34,12
SHANE SMITH: And so we started
having some questions of, why


257
0:13:34,12 --> 0:13:35,8
is this actually happening
in Darfur?


258
0:13:35,8 --> 0:13:36,82
What's really happening?


259
0:13:36,82 --> 0:13:38,39
So we started asking
the people if


260
0:13:38,39 --> 0:13:39,61
they had any answers.


261
0:13:39,61 --> 0:13:41,31
Some people say it's racial.


262
0:13:41,31 --> 0:13:42,76
Some people say it's economic.


263
0:13:42,76 --> 0:13:44,56
Some people say it's
political.


264
0:13:44,56 --> 0:13:45,96
People in the South
say one thing.


265
0:13:45,96 --> 0:13:48,2
People in Khartoum say
another thing.


266
0:13:48,2 --> 0:13:50,99
And I'm just trying to find out
what the general consensus


267
0:13:50,99 --> 0:13:52,38
of why it's happening is.

0:13:52,38 --> 0:13:56,86



269
0:13:56,86 --> 0:13:58,86
SHANE SMITH: We started hearing
a lot of rumors about


270
0:13:58,86 --> 0:14:0,53
finding oil in Darfur.


271
0:14:0,53 --> 0:14:3,43
So we went into the camp to meet
some people from Darfur


272
0:14:3,43 --> 0:14:4,97
and hear what their
stories were.


273
0:14:4,97 --> 0:14:6,95
We're going to our
friend's house.


274
0:14:6,95 --> 0:14:8,71
He's from Darfur.


275
0:14:8,71 --> 0:14:11,69
He was just telling us that the
Janjaweed said, we want


276
0:14:11,69 --> 0:14:13,58
you to go because
you're black.


277
0:14:13,58 --> 0:14:14,75
But they were the same color.


278
0:14:14,75 --> 0:14:18,21
And even in Khartoum the
Arabs are black.


279
0:14:18,21 --> 0:14:19,6
So he's saying, he's
not stupid.


280
0:14:19,6 --> 0:14:22,21
He understands that they're
just telling him that.


281
0:14:22,21 --> 0:14:24,61
But they want him to go for
another reason because they


282
0:14:24,61 --> 0:14:26,5
want the land.


283
0:14:26,5 --> 0:14:47,7



284
0:14:47,7 --> 0:14:50,79
SHANE SMITH: He had members of
his family, young babies,


285
0:14:50,79 --> 0:14:52,28
thrown into fire.


286
0:14:52,28 --> 0:14:53,97
His father was killed.


287
0:14:53,97 --> 0:14:55,7
His family was killed.


288
0:14:55,7 --> 0:14:57,31
And he was kicked
out of his land.


289
0:14:57,31 --> 0:15:1,18
And what we were just talking
about after that was in the


290
0:15:1,18 --> 0:15:4,96
South, we saw that the informal
militias started


291
0:15:4,96 --> 0:15:8,71
coming when Chevron discovered
oil, kicking people off their


292
0:15:8,71 --> 0:15:11,38
land, starting a 20
year civil war.


293
0:15:11,38 --> 0:15:14,32
And now what's happened is they
just found oil in Darfur.


294
0:15:14,32 --> 0:15:16,4
And a lot of people say
that the problem


295
0:15:16,4 --> 0:15:17,61
in Darfur is racial.


296
0:15:17,61 --> 0:15:19,28
But when we talked to a lot
of people, they say we


297
0:15:19,28 --> 0:15:20,36
found oil in Darfur.


298
0:15:20,36 --> 0:15:23,15
And then it became much more
serious of a problem.


299
0:15:23,15 --> 0:15:24,2
They want the land.


300
0:15:24,2 --> 0:15:25,12
They want the land for cattle.


301
0:15:25,12 --> 0:15:26,49
They want the land for oil.


302
0:15:26,49 --> 0:15:27,48
This is what's happening.


303
0:15:27,48 --> 0:15:28,9
And it already happened
in the South.


304
0:15:28,9 --> 0:15:30,77
Everybody here knows it.


305
0:15:30,77 --> 0:15:33,5
But no one is reporting on
that for some reason.


306
0:15:33,5 --> 0:15:37,3
So after hearing about finding
oil in Darfur and hearing that


307
0:15:37,3 --> 0:15:39,92
it was so similar to what had
already happened down South,


308
0:15:39,92 --> 0:15:42,59
we decided to go to the Unity
State where they first found


309
0:15:42,59 --> 0:15:44,58
oil and check out what
had happened there.

goes, oh yeah, you'll see a

because they're really old.

The Russians just give really
old helicopters.

it's shaking around.

left during the war, and then

found oil there.

just started kicking

everybody off the land.

0:17:38,6 --> 0:17:39,1

It used to be Chevron.

in front of one

of the unity wells.


366
0:17:48,65 --> 0:17:51,37
A lot of people think in America
that the war here is


367
0:17:51,37 --> 0:17:56,93
racial, between the Arab
population from the North and


368
0:17:56,93 --> 0:17:59,62
the animist population
in the South.


369
0:17:59,62 --> 0:18:1,915
But the war started with the
finding the oil here.


370
0:18:1,915 --> 0:18:3,165
Is that true?

take the oil.

0:18:21,33 --> 0:18:27,53



374
0:18:27,53 --> 0:18:29,1

fighting to get--

0:18:29,1 --> 0:18:34,29



376
0:18:34,29 --> 0:18:36,0
SHANE SMITH: '82, '83.


377
0:18:36,0 --> 0:18:37,11
We have to hurry.


378
0:18:37,11 --> 0:18:40,85
And we have to get out and in
very quickly, because the oil


379
0:18:40,85 --> 0:18:41,97
security is very tight.


380
0:18:41,97 --> 0:18:43,21
They don't want us shooting.


381
0:18:43,21 --> 0:18:44,59
They don't want anybody
to know.


382
0:18:44,59 --> 0:18:47,4
So we have to jump in, jump
out, jump in, jump out.


383
0:18:47,4 --> 0:18:49,7
And no one can see us, otherwise
we'd get in a lot of

0:18:49,7 --> 0:18:51,22
trouble and go to jail.

was terrified.


387
0:19:6,28 --> 0:19:7,63
If they catch you, that's it.


388
0:19:7,63 --> 0:19:9,12
So we get out of the
car, shoot it.


389
0:19:9,12 --> 0:19:10,49
This is the unity well.


390
0:19:10,49 --> 0:19:12,775
First thing, Chevron, in, out.


391
0:19:12,775 --> 0:19:14,82
When we have more time, we
went to the villages.


392
0:19:14,82 --> 0:19:17,6
And that's where it was really
sad, because you walk and


393
0:19:17,6 --> 0:19:18,42
there's just garbage
everywhere.


394
0:19:18,42 --> 0:19:20,87
We're here in Bentiu, which is
the capital of the Unity

0:19:20,87 --> 0:19:26,67
State, which is the richest oil
concentration in Sudan.


396
0:19:26,67 --> 0:19:31,81
But as you can see, a lot of the
oil money, most of it goes


397
0:19:31,81 --> 0:19:33,19
north or to China.


398
0:19:33,19 --> 0:19:35,52
But very little of it
is coming here for


399
0:19:35,52 --> 0:19:38,16
infrastructure, for
water, for roads.


400
0:19:38,16 --> 0:19:40,65
We're just checking it out with
our friend Charles who is


401
0:19:40,65 --> 0:19:43,54
explaining to us the political
situation of what's happening.


402
0:19:43,54 --> 0:19:48,19



403
0:19:48,19 --> 0:19:50,91
SHANE SMITH: So most of the oil
in all of Sudan is from


404
0:19:50,91 --> 0:19:52,83
the Unity State, but
it looks very poor.


405
0:19:52,83 --> 0:20:2,16



406
0:20:2,16 --> 0:20:5,62
SHANE SMITH: So where does all
the money from the oil go?


407
0:20:5,62 --> 0:20:26,6



408
0:20:26,6 --> 0:20:28,5
SHANE SMITH: They don't
have water.


409
0:20:28,5 --> 0:20:31,95
There's a huge malaria
epidemic.


410
0:20:31,95 --> 0:20:33,93
Anybody get any fish?


411
0:20:33,93 --> 0:20:36,29
So the kids all come fish
in polluted water.


412
0:20:36,29 --> 0:20:39,765
There's a lot of water-borne
diseases.


413
0:20:39,765 --> 0:20:43,8
They use popcorn, and they
have a little string.


414
0:20:43,8 --> 0:20:45,51
They try to get fish
out of here.


415
0:20:45,51 --> 0:20:49,64
The men get water
right from here.


416
0:20:49,64 --> 0:20:54,33
And then they just bring it with
a donkey to town and sell


417
0:20:54,33 --> 0:20:58,3
it untreated, which of course
leads to a lot of disease.


418
0:20:58,3 --> 0:20:59,24
And you're like, hold on.


419
0:20:59,24 --> 0:21:0,61
You have a ton of oil.


420
0:21:0,61 --> 0:21:2,44
Shouldn't you have money?


421
0:21:2,44 --> 0:21:5,2
All the money goes to China,
Malaysia, and Khartoum.


422
0:21:5,2 --> 0:21:6,57
They're supposed to get 2%.


423
0:21:6,57 --> 0:21:7,53
But they don't have auditing.


424
0:21:7,53 --> 0:21:9,9
So it's 2% of what?


425
0:21:9,9 --> 0:21:32,93



426
0:21:32,93 --> 0:21:34,74
SHANE SMITH: So they don't
get any money.


427
0:21:34,74 --> 0:21:37,47
And it's unbelievable poverty.


428
0:21:37,47 --> 0:21:40,42
But right next to oil, right
next to these wells.


429
0:21:40,42 --> 0:21:43,765
And they won't even hire them
to work in the camps.


430
0:21:43,765 --> 0:21:47,68
They only bring in Chinese
and Malaysian workers.


431
0:21:47,68 --> 0:21:52,8
So we're just in the village,
and they don't have water.


432
0:21:52,8 --> 0:21:54,9
So they get just water untreated
from the river and


433
0:21:54,9 --> 0:21:57,8
they sell it to the villagers,
which makes


434
0:21:57,8 --> 0:21:58,65
everybody very sick.


435
0:21:58,65 --> 0:22:3,19
But even though right down the
street there's a brand new


436
0:22:3,19 --> 0:22:5,19
petrol station for
all the trucks.


437
0:22:5,19 --> 0:22:9,7
The only roads are built for
the trucks to come get the


438
0:22:9,7 --> 0:22:11,97
petrol, which just goes north.


439
0:22:11,97 --> 0:22:14,42
And you see, oh, they
found the oil.


440
0:22:14,42 --> 0:22:18,38
Paramilitary groups come in,
kill everybody, get them off


441
0:22:18,38 --> 0:22:20,81
the land, take the oil.


442
0:22:20,81 --> 0:22:22,97
Now, OK, we've got the oil.


443
0:22:22,97 --> 0:22:24,2
Now then people can come back.


444
0:22:24,2 --> 0:22:24,65
We don't care.


445
0:22:24,65 --> 0:22:25,61
It's ours.


446
0:22:25,61 --> 0:22:27,49
Oh, find the oil in Darfur.


447
0:22:27,49 --> 0:22:30,1
Send in the paramilitary groups,
kill everybody off,


448
0:22:30,1 --> 0:22:31,41
take the oil.


449
0:22:31,41 --> 0:22:32,63
They've been doing
it for 20 years.


450

[SUDANESE MUSIC PLAYING]


451
0:22:47,789 --> 0:22:49,815
SHANE SMITH: We were driving
out to the pyramids.


452
0:22:49,815 --> 0:22:53,4
And as we were driving out,
there was a huge Chinese


453
0:22:53,4 --> 0:22:55,53
refinery in the middle
of the desert.


454
0:22:55,53 --> 0:22:58,24
Khartoum really doesn't want
you to know about oil.


455
0:22:58,24 --> 0:23:2,63
Because what happened was in the
South, Chevron found oil.


456
0:23:2,63 --> 0:23:6,26
Right after that, paramilitary
groups came into the South and


457
0:23:6,26 --> 0:23:8,57
started just exterminating
everybody.


458
0:23:8,57 --> 0:23:9,11
Why?


459
0:23:9,11 --> 0:23:10,37
Because they wanted the oil.


460
0:23:10,37 --> 0:23:12,41
So there's a huge civil war.


461
0:23:12,41 --> 0:23:13,96
Four million people
are killed.


462
0:23:13,96 --> 0:23:15,82
All the oil is going
to Khartoum.


463
0:23:15,82 --> 0:23:19,45
So the petrol profits are
going to Khartoum.


464
0:23:19,45 --> 0:23:20,54
And then they're
buying weapons.


465
0:23:20,54 --> 0:23:21,51
Why are they buying weapons?


466
0:23:21,51 --> 0:23:23,8
Because they found
oil in Darfur.


467
0:23:23,8 --> 0:23:27,11
But this is what starts and
finishes the whole problem in


468
0:23:27,11 --> 0:23:29,7
Darfur, the whole problem
in southern Sudan.


469
0:23:29,7 --> 0:23:30,4
It's all about the oil.


470
0:23:30,4 --> 0:23:32,35
And this is where they
refine it right here.


471
0:23:32,35 --> 0:23:35,23
We're shooting literally for two
minutes in the middle of


472
0:23:35,23 --> 0:23:35,94
the Sahara.


473
0:23:35,94 --> 0:23:38,1
There's nothing near us.


474
0:23:38,1 --> 0:23:39,5
We're shooting this refinery.


475
0:23:39,5 --> 0:23:40,73
I'm saying, OK it's
all about oil.


476
0:23:40,73 --> 0:23:41,53
The war's about oil.


477
0:23:41,53 --> 0:23:42,44
Bang.


478
0:23:42,44 --> 0:23:44,92
Out of nowhere, this dude comes
screaming up, grabs the


479
0:23:44,92 --> 0:23:48,44
camera right away, is about to
take us into jail, got a gun.


480
0:23:48,44 --> 0:23:50,6
Thank God we had a Ministry
of Information guy to


481
0:23:50,6 --> 0:23:51,29
say, no, no, no.


482
0:23:51,29 --> 0:23:51,78
Wait, wait, wait.


483
0:23:51,78 --> 0:23:53,46
He took the camera back
from the guy.


484
0:23:53,46 --> 0:23:55,59
As they were arguing, we went
back into the truck and then


485
0:23:55,59 --> 0:23:56,59
we just got out of there.


486
0:23:56,59 --> 0:23:59,16
RAZAN AHMED: Most of the time,
they break your camera first


487
0:23:59,16 --> 0:24:0,78
and then they let you explain.


488
0:24:0,78 --> 0:24:3,6
Other times, they don't just
break your camera, they break


489
0:24:3,6 --> 0:24:4,57
your bones.


490
0:24:4,57 --> 0:24:5,61
They beat you up.


491
0:24:5,61 --> 0:24:7,351
We could've easily
gone to jail.


492
0:24:7,351 --> 0:24:8,692
We were very, very lucky.


493
0:24:8,692 --> 0:24:11,12
SHANE SMITH: When we finally got
to the pyramids, I was so


494
0:24:11,12 --> 0:24:12,43
happy that I was giddy.


495
0:24:12,43 --> 0:24:13,2
I was giggling.


496
0:24:13,2 --> 0:24:14,25
I couldn't stop laughing.


497
0:24:14,25 --> 0:24:16,34
I was nearly in tears
that we weren't


498
0:24:16,34 --> 0:24:17,48
rotting in a pit somewhere.


499
0:24:17,48 --> 0:24:20,87
Because when they arrest you
in Sudan, you go to jail.


500
0:24:20,87 --> 0:24:23,94
And you go to jail for life,
no trial, no nothing.


501
0:24:23,94 --> 0:24:28,4
We had to drive four hours
through the Sahara to get to


502
0:24:28,4 --> 0:24:32,81
these pyramids and
nobody's here.


503
0:24:32,81 --> 0:24:33,72
Surprise, surprise.


504
0:24:33,72 --> 0:24:36,89
In Sudan, you're not allowed to
travel outside of Khartoum.


505
0:24:36,89 --> 0:24:39,13
No one's been here for months.


506
0:24:39,13 --> 0:24:43,4
So there's just us
and a camel guy.


507
0:24:43,4 --> 0:24:43,93
Yes, hello.

0:24:45,58 --> 0:24:47,56
[ARABIC].


511
0:24:47,56 --> 0:24:53,38
These are the oldest pyramids
in the world apparently.


512
0:24:53,38 --> 0:24:55,96
Hold on, let me start again.


513
0:24:55,96 --> 0:24:58,13
It's really hard to
stay on up here.


514
0:24:58,13 --> 0:25:1,33
But these pyramids are older
than the pyramids in Egypt.


515
0:25:1,33 --> 0:25:3,8
They're Nubian pyramids.


516
0:25:3,8 --> 0:25:6,97
And it shows the state of
affairs of tourism in Egypt


517
0:25:6,97 --> 0:25:8,51
versus tourism in Sudan.


518
0:25:8,51 --> 0:25:11,26
Because the pyramids in Egypt,
it's basically Disneyland.


519
0:25:11,26 --> 0:25:13,81
And here, as you can see,
there's absolutely nobody.

for about a week now.


522
0:25:34,39 --> 0:25:38,54
And we've been afraid the whole
time about police, or


523
0:25:38,54 --> 0:25:40,89
getting caught, or getting
our cameras smashed.


524
0:25:40,89 --> 0:25:42,44
We couldn't really
eat anything.

0:25:42,44 --> 0:25:44,8
Water was hard to get,
clean water.


526
0:25:44,8 --> 0:25:45,96
We didn't sleep.


527
0:25:45,96 --> 0:25:49,3
Our doctors had warned us of
worms that fly out of the sand

0:25:49,3 --> 0:25:50,9
into your eye.


529
0:25:50,9 --> 0:25:53,2
We were worried about malaria.


530
0:25:53,2 --> 0:25:56,53
We couldn't get boners because
of our malaria pills.

0:25:56,53 --> 0:25:58,65
We were just getting at
the end of our rope.


532
0:25:58,65 --> 0:25:59,42
And we're like, wait a minute.


533
0:25:59,42 --> 0:26:1,76
We haven't even gotten close
to Darfur yet, where it was


534
0:26:1,76 --> 0:26:3,64
really dangerous.


535
0:26:3,64 --> 0:26:5,18

[SUDANESE MUSIC PLAYING]

SHANE SMITH: Flying into Al
Fashir, which is the political


538
0:26:22,5 --> 0:26:25,46
capital of Darfur, you see the
effects of the conflict


539
0:26:25,46 --> 0:26:26,48
everywhere.


540
0:26:26,48 --> 0:26:28,66
First of all, we weren't even
allowed into Darfur.


541
0:26:28,66 --> 0:26:31,3
They had made it illegal for any
foreign press to go there.


542
0:26:31,3 --> 0:26:33,78
The airport was as far as
the UN could take us.


543
0:26:33,78 --> 0:26:36,79
In fact, a National Geographic
journalist and his crew had


544
0:26:36,79 --> 0:26:39,52
just been thrown in jail days
before for sneaking into


545
0:26:39,52 --> 0:26:40,81
Darfur through Chad.


546
0:26:40,81 --> 0:26:43,39
When we arrived in Al Fashir
proper, we weren't allowed to


547
0:26:43,39 --> 0:26:44,25
shoot any footage.


548
0:26:44,25 --> 0:26:46,63
Because it was not only illegal
to be there, but the


549
0:26:46,63 --> 0:26:49,14
town was filled with Janjaweed,
Sudanese armed


550
0:26:49,14 --> 0:26:51,22
forces, and SLA.


551
0:26:51,22 --> 0:26:54,8
The SLA are the rebel militia
headed by Minni Minnawi, who


552
0:26:54,8 --> 0:26:57,9
we had just snuck into
Darfur to interview.


553
0:26:57,9 --> 0:27:0,75
We're here in the headquarters
of the SLF slash M to meet


554
0:27:0,75 --> 0:27:2,62
Minna Minnawi, who is
now the fourth most


555
0:27:2,62 --> 0:27:4,6
powerful man in Sudan.


556
0:27:4,6 --> 0:27:5,75
He was the main guy fighting
Janjaweed.


557
0:27:5,75 --> 0:27:8,39
And the government has made a
peace agreement with him.


558
0:27:8,39 --> 0:27:11,5
Minnawi, because he fought the
Janjaweed, is a hero to some.


559
0:27:11,5 --> 0:27:14,18
But others, like Amnesty
International, accuse him of


560
0:27:14,18 --> 0:27:17,48
raping and killing civilians
as recently as last July.


561
0:27:17,48 --> 0:27:19,29
So as I was rushed in to
do the interview, I


562
0:27:19,29 --> 0:27:20,72
sat across from him.


563
0:27:20,72 --> 0:27:21,525
I looked into his face.


564
0:27:21,525 --> 0:27:23,58
And it was totally,
totally fucked up.


565
0:27:23,58 --> 0:27:24,53
And what do you think--


566
0:27:24,53 --> 0:27:29,9
I know that Al Jazeera reported
that they found oil


567
0:27:29,9 --> 0:27:31,1
in Darfur, which is
why there's a


568
0:27:31,1 --> 0:27:32,21
lot of these problems.


569
0:27:32,21 --> 0:27:36,13
Because in the South, in the
Unity State, they found oil.


570
0:27:36,13 --> 0:27:39,14
And then paramilitary groups
came to clear people out.


571
0:27:39,14 --> 0:27:42,16
And now maybe they found oil
in Darfur, and paramilitary


572
0:27:42,16 --> 0:27:44,44
groups like the Janjaweed
are clearing people out.


573
0:27:44,44 --> 0:27:45,69
Do you know anything
about that?


574
0:27:45,69 --> 0:27:48,93

0:27:48,93 --> 0:28:20,31



576
0:28:20,31 --> 0:28:23,31
SHANE SMITH: I don't have
a satellite myself.


577
0:28:23,31 --> 0:28:25,26
And now that you're part of
the government, do you see


578
0:28:25,26 --> 0:28:29,5
that helping the problem in
Darfur, political problem?

0:28:33,6 --> 0:29:7,461



581
0:29:7,461 --> 0:29:10,555
SHANE SMITH: I went out back to
where Minnawi's troops were


582
0:29:10,555 --> 0:29:14,58
singing SLA songs and realized
that it was militia men just


583
0:29:14,58 --> 0:29:17,95
like these who were responsible
for the Lost Boys,


584
0:29:17,95 --> 0:29:21,6
for the refugees in the IDP
camps, for taking Rasheed's


585
0:29:21,6 --> 0:29:24,98
two-month-old brother and
throwing him into a fire.


586
0:29:24,98 --> 0:29:28,167
