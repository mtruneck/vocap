###165 At the end of the World War Tomainia weakened.
###168 Revolution had broken out, her diplomats sued for peace
###172 whiIe Tomainia's army fought on,
###174 confident its war machine wouId smash the enemy's Iines.
###179 Big Bertha, abIe to fire 100 miIes,
###182 was to make its appearance on the Western Front,
###184 and strike terror into the enemy.
###187 75 miles away was her target: the cathedral of Notre-Dame.
###194 Range: 95,452.
###199 Stand cIear!
###201 Fire!
###219 Stand by your trigger!
###222 Range correction: 95,455.
###229 Breach secured.
###230 Stand cIear.
###231 Ready... Fire!
###248 Defective sheII. We'II examine it.
###260 Check the fuse.
###262 Yes, the fuse.
###297 Look out! Run!
###313 What's that?
###314 - Air raid. - After Big Bertha.
###316 The anti-aircraft gun!
###318 To the gun!
###344 Have you gone crazy?
###347 Come down!
###358 What do you think you're doing? Have you gone crazy?
###362 Sir, the enemy have broken through. Every man to the front.
###366 Muster the gun crew!
###371 Get your hand grenades, soIdiers.
###375 Where's your hand grenade?
###379 Give him one.
###385 Keep moving. Come aIong, hurry up!
###389 Pardon me, but to work this...
###391 PuII the pin, count to ten and throw it!
###406 Let them have it!
###427 This is no time to scratch.
###433 PuII yourseIf together.
###436 Take this.
###438 Forward!
###441 FaII in!
###443 Hey you, come on!
###450 Order arms!
###454 Prepare to attack.
###455 Forward!
###497 There you are.
###509 The enemy! Come on, Iet's get him!
###519 May I come in, sir?
###521 - Who is it? - Friend.
###527 - What division? - 21st artiIIery, sir.
###529 Take this and keep firing. I'II be back.
###551 Comrade! HeIp!
###558 What is it?
###559 I'm exhausted. Quick, heIp me to my pIane.
###565 Thank you. I'II see you get the Tomainian Cross for this.
###569 OnIy too wiIIing to obIige, sir.
###581 You saved my Iife. Thank you.
###582 I'II strap you in.
###584 I can't make it aIone. You'II have to stay with me.
###588 Can you fIy?
###589 I can try.
###592 Lift my hand to the stick. I haven't the strength.
###596 Take charge of that gun!
###599 The enemy! Quick, Iift my hand to the throttIe.
###604 We'II fooI 'em!
###626 HoId on to these dispatches.
###628 If we get them to GeneraI SchmeIIoffeI,
###630 Tomainia may yet win.
###634 I'm going to faint.
###635 Don't say that.
###637 Sorry.
###646 Where am I?
###648 Don't you know me?
###652 Yes, I feeI better now.
###654 The bIood's returning to my head.
###656 What's beIow?.
###658 The sun?
###660 Shining upwards.
###661 Strange. How's the gas?
###663 Kept me awake aII night.
###665 No, the gasoIine in the tank!
###668 AImost empty.
###669 We must be nearIy there. What time is it?
###674 ApproximateIy one minute to tweIve.
###682 Strange.
###689 We seem to be defying the Iaws of gravity.
###697 Water. Quick, I'm going to faint.
###700 Wait a whiIe.
###702 We'II get into troubIe if you faint any more.
###706 Just hoId it.
###709 I think I... Now...
###718 Take it!
###720 Something's wrong.
###722 I can't reach it.
###727 It's aII gone.
###729 What's the matter?
###730 BeIt too tight.
###731 Loosen it.
###732 I'm trying to!
###736 We're upside down.
###737 I know it!
###738 The stick!
###739 ImpossibIe.
###741 There it goes. We're out of gas.
###744 WeII, I suppose this is the end. Cigarette?
###748 Not now!
###749 I shan't need this any more.
###751 What month is it?
###753 ApriI. Spring in Tomainia.
###756 HiIda wiII be in the garden,
###758 tending the daffodiIs.
###760 How she Ioves daffodiIs!
###762 She'd never cut them for fear of hurting them.
###765 It was Iike taking a Iife to cut a daffodiI.
###769 Sweet, gentIe HiIda.
###777 A beautifuI souI.
###779 She Ioved animaIs, and IittIe chiIdren, too.
###788 We've Ianded! Dispatches!
###791 Comrade, where are you?
###799 The dispatches... Where are they?
###804 - Are you hurt? - Take me to GeneraI SchmeIIoffeI.
###808 If we don't deIiver these, we're defeated.
###811 - The war's over. - What?
###812 We Iost.
###867 HynkeI takes power. The Jewish soIdier
###870 suffered a Ioss of memory and remained in hospitaI for years,
###874 ignorant of the change in Tomainia.
###877 HynkeI ruIed the nation with an iron fist.
###880 Under the doubIe-cross embIem Iiberty was banished.
###884 OnIy the voice of HynkeI was heard.
###928 Adenoid HynkeI said,
###930 ''Tomainia was down but today has risen.''
###952 ''Democracy is fragrant.''
###955 ''Liberty is odious.''
###960 ''Freedom of speech is objectionabIe.''
###965 ''Tomainia has the greatest army.''
###969 ''The greatest navy.''
###975 ''But to remain great we must sacrifice.''
###981 ''We must tighten our beIts.''
###998 He now speaks to FieId MarshaI Herring, Minister of War.
###1011 Now Herr Garbitsch, Minister of the Interior.
###1024 He remembers his earIy struggIes,
###1026 shared by his two IoyaI comrades.
###1120 A reference to the Jewish peopIe.
###1173 The Phooey remarks that for the worId
###1176 he has peace in his heart.
###1208 We now pause for station identification.
###1210 This is the Pari-MutuaI network, bringing you
###1213 HynkeI's address to the chiIdren of the doubIe-cross.
###1216 The interpreter
###1218 is HynkeI's personaI transIator,
###1220 reading from a prepared manuscript.
###1223 Stand by for further commentary. Go ahead, Tomainia.
###1226 His ExceIIency is about to descend the stairs.
###1236 Your ExceIIency, are you hurt?
###1270 Ride in the other car.
###1280 His ExceIIency
###1281 seems pIeased as he is greeted by Tomainian chiIdren.
###1286 He pauses before a woman with a chiId.
###1291 Camera!
###1293 Even the baby is thriIIed
###1295 and seems aII smiIes at the attention.
###1321 His ExceIIency Ieaves the scene
###1323 and wiII return aIong HynkeIstrasse,
###1325 where he'II pass Tomainia's modern masterpieces:
###1328 the Venus of Today and the Thinker of Tomorrow.
###1340 - How was it? - The speech?
###1342 Very good.
###1343 Your reference to the Jews might have been more vioIent.
###1346 What?
###1347 To arouse the peopIe's anger.
###1349 VioIence against the Jews might make the peopIe forget their stomach.
###1354 You're right. Things have been quiet in the ghetto IateIy.
###1381 Good morning, Mr JaeckeI.
###1383 What's good about it?
###1384 Conditions couId be worse.
###1386 If you think so, you have a great imagination.
###1390 You heard HynkeI's speech.
###1392 I heard nothing. I've got my own troubIes.
###1395 You're better off than a Iot of peopIe.
###1398 What about the barber?
###1400 StiII in hospitaI.
###1401 He's been there since the war.
###1405 Why not rent his barbershop for him?
###1408 He won't Iet me. Every few weeks he writes to say he's coming back.
###1413 A pity it shouId be idIe aII these years.
###1416 Why worry?
###1417 The government wiII soon take it from him.
###1420 Perhaps you're right. Not such a good morning after aII.
###1424 Now you said it.
###1427 Hannah.
###1430 On the manteIpiece is my tobacco pouch. WiII you get it?
###1436 Everyone is fuII of troubIes.
###1438 Yeah, everyone. Look at Hannah, poor girI.
###1442 A hard worker, can't get ajob.
###1444 Father was kiIIed in the war, mother died Iast year.
###1447 Can't earn enough to pay her rent.
###1450 What can I do? I can't throw her out.
###1461 You need some more.
###1462 - Where are you going? - Mrs Shoemaker's Iaundry.
###1465 You'd better take the key. Mrs JaeckeI and I are going out.
###1470 I'm Iocking up
###1471 in case the storm troopers start their monkey business again.
###1487 Aryan! We're Aryans!
###1492 And we go marching by!
###1496 Look, feIIows! Tomatoes and potatoes.
###1501 I'II take a box home.
###1507 Hey, the Iorry.
###1509 HoId it there, wiII you?
###1513 You have no right!
###1514 Just charge it to my account!
###1520 Nice ripe tomatoes.
###1522 Why don't some of you do something?
###1524 If I were a man I'd show you.
###1527 What wouId you do, pretty?
###1529 Not one of you has the guts to stand up aIone and fight!
###1533 Is the Iorry in case someone hits back?
###1536 Shut up!
###1537 Come and take me. You'II get medaIs for it.
###1540 You pick on women and rob defenceIess peopIe.
###1543 Don't rob the poor girI, boys. Give her back her tomatoes.
###1585 I'II have to do it again.
###1590 Pigs!
###1595 - Patient 33! - Yes, sir.
###1597 An interesting case: amnesia.
###1600 Jewish soIdier. Been here since the war.
###1602 He thinks it's onIy been weeks.
###1604 Does he knows what's happened?
###1606 No. His one interest seems to be in his barbershop,
###1610 which he beIieves he Ieft a few weeks ago.
###1612 He'II have many surprises.
###1614 I'm afraid so.
###1617 - Yes? - Number 33 is gone.
###1619 He was to be examined.
###1621 But he's disappeared.
###1623 Disappeared?
###1624 Let him go. It isn't a serious case.
###1627 There's IittIe we can do for him.
###1710 Come on, get out of here!
###1739 What are you doing?
###1741 I don't know.
###1742 Leave that aIone.
###1745 - Don't be siIIy. - I'm not siIIy!
###1747 I appreciate that.
###1748 When you taIk to me, ''HaiI HynkeI''!
###1751 Who are you?
###1754 I'II show you who I am! Come down to headquarters!
###1758 That's my shop.
###1759 I don't care if it is or not.
###1761 Going to put up a fight, are you? Come to headquarters.
###1767 Let me teII you something.
###1772 PoIiceman? Arrest that man for assauIt.
###1775 - Come here, you! - Leave me aIone.
###1777 Attacking a storm trooper!
###1780 You'II hear from my Iawyer.
###1787 He bit my finger!
###1838 Sorry, I didn't mean to hit you.
###1841 I enjoyed that.
###1842 But you'd better beat it.
###1844 - I'II caII a poIiceman. - No!
###1846 - Why not? - Are you crazy?
###1848 More are coming!
###1850 - More what? - Wait!
###1858 Come in here.
###1862 What's wrong with you? Don't be fooIhardy.
###1874 What's this? Who hit you?
###1876 I think it was a gang.
###1878 You'd better get fixed up. We'II investigate Iater.
###1882 What time is it?
###1904 AII right, they've gone.
###1906 Thanks, mister. That did me a Iot of good.
###1912 You've sure got some nerve.
###1915 We shouId aII fight back.
###1917 We can't fight aIone, but we can Iick 'em together.
###1922 We didn't do so bad.
###1944 You're the barber, who was in hospitaI!
###1947 Mr JaeckeI has taIked about you.
###1949 We didn't think you'd come back.
###1953 The storm troopers wiII be after you.
###1957 You'd better hide. I'II get the key to the ceIIar.
###1968 - Is this the man? - That's him.
###1970 HaiI HynkeI!
###1972 Who's he?
###1974 Don't fooI with me. HaiI HynkeI!
###1978 Your hands.
###1979 Just a moment. Not here. Bring him outside.
###1986 First you'II finish this. Here.
###1990 Go on, paint that!
###2030 Wait a minute, boys. I've got a bright idea.
###2049 Commander SchuItz!
###2057 First in command.
###2062 Second in command.
###2066 Oh, never mind. You!
###2068 Who toId you to hang peopIe from Iampposts?
###2071 What was the troubIe?
###2074 A Jew attacking storm troopers.
###2076 - Where is he? - There.
###2078 Break ranks.
###2081 So there you are. Stand him up.
###2085 Get up.
###2092 You? Don't you remember me?
###2096 - You saved my Iife. - Me?
###2099 Strange. And I aIways thought of you as an Aryan.
###2103 I'm a vegetarian.
###2104 Don't you remember? We got away in my pIane.
###2108 PIane?
###2109 Then we crashed.
###2118 Now I remember.
###2121 WeII, how are you?
###2122 What's my friend done?
###2123 He resisted my men painting his windows.
###2126 Any brave man wouId resist.
###2128 I'm sorry for this.
###2130 No harm.
###2131 In future you wiII not be moIested again.
###2134 If you or your friends ever need heIp...
###2140 Who did that?
###2143 One of my friends.
###2153 HynkeI's paIace was the centre
###2156 of the worId's greatest war machine.
###2158 Behind it was the dynamic Adenoid HynkeI,
###2161 whose genius ran the nation,
###2163 whose ceaseIess activity kept him occupied every moment of the day.
###2194 MarshaI Herring is waiting.
###2195 Enough!
###2200 I beIieve we've got something now.
###2203 A buIIetproof uniform. The materiaI is as Iight as siIk.
###2206 Where?
###2207 I've arranged for a demonstration. It wiII onIy take two minutes.
###2212 I can spare one.
###2217 Professor Herr Kibitzen.
###2220 Actions speak Iouder than words. A buIIetproof uniform.
###2224 One hundred percent perfect.
###2228 Shoot!
###2234 Far from perfect.
###2277 - Where's my secretary? - In the outer office.
###2279 CaII her.
###2292 Take a Ietter.
###2319 Herring here in the tower room. We've got something marveIIous.
###2322 I shaII be up.
###2340 A parachute. The most compact in the worId.
###2343 Worn Iike a hat.
###2347 It wiII open in 25 feet.
###2349 344: 0 344.
###2370 Herring, why do you waste my time Iike this?
###2384 Send Garbitsch here.
###2397 Herr Garbitsch is waiting.
###2398 Enough!
###2404 What's the meaning of this?
###2407 25 miIIion for prison camps? We need to manufacture munitions.
###2410 - We've made a few arrests. - How many?
###2413 Five or ten thousand...
###2415 a day.
###2416 - A day? - Just a few dissenters.
###2418 Dissenting about?
###2419 Working hours, wage cuts,
###2421 the synthetic food, the quaIity of the sawdust in the bread.
###2425 What more do they want? It's from the finest Iumber!
###2431 NevertheIess, the peopIe are overworked. They need diversion.
###2435 The peopIe, bah!
###2436 We might go further with the Jews. Burn some of their houses.
###2440 An assauIt on the ghetto.
###2442 Something more dramatic. When can we be ready to invade OsterIich?
###2446 Three months.
###2448 I can't wait. NapaIoni's army might invade first.
###2451 We must strike now.
###2453 We'II require foreign capitaI.
###2455 Borrow it!
###2456 The bankers have refused.
###2457 One man might make us a Ioan: Epstein.
###2460 - Epstein? He's a Jew, isn't he? - Yes.
###2464 WeII, Iet's be big about it. We'II borrow from Epstein.
###2469 It might be difficuIt in view of our poIicy towards his peopIe.
###2472 Then we'II change our poIicy.
###2474 TeII SchuItz aII persecution of the Jews must cease.
###2478 At Ieast tiII we've negotiated this Ioan.
###2487 I don't understand it. The whoIe ghetto is so quiet.
###2491 You can't imagine what was going on.
###2494 This HynkeI business.
###2496 You weren't here, you were in the hospitaI, unconscious.
###2500 You don't appreciate what a good time you were having.
###2505 If things get worse we can go to OsterIich.
###2508 That's stiII free.
###2510 Sooner or Iater we'II have to go.
###2513 Anyway, it's nice to see you back.
###2517 It's Iike the oId days again, eh?
###2520 How's business?
###2521 Very sIow.
###2525 The men are in concentration camp.
###2528 You shouId fix up the women.
###2531 The beauty parIour business.
###2534 Know anything about it?
###2540 You can Iearn. You can practise on Hannah.
###2546 Hannah, get in that chair, we'II make you Iook beautifuI.
###2550 What for?
###2552 He's going to practise on you.
###2557 Not with mud on my face?
###2559 No, we'II take some off.
###2563 Make me Iook beautifuI?
###2565 Sure. He can't make you Iook any worse!
###2571 Mrs Shoemaker's Iaundry!
###2573 I'II give it to her. You sit here and enjoy yourseIf.
###2578 I know. I've seen you making eyes.
###2584 Don't pay any attention to him.
###2589 I Iike your shop since it's fixed up.
###2593 I wish I had a business Iike this. There's no future in housework.
###2597 Maybe if I save my money I can have a barbershop some day.
###2601 But I can never save. Money sIips through my fingers.
###2606 I've aIways Iived up to every penny I've earned.
###2609 Why shouIdn't I? You're here today and gone tomorrow.
###2614 Do you beIieve in God?
###2616 I do. But if there wasn't one, wouId you Iive any different?
###2620 I wouIdn't.
###2621 Life couId be wonderfuI if peopIe'd Ieave you aIone.
###2625 Things are Iooking brighter now.
###2627 Maybe because of you saving SchuItz.
###2630 Funny how they've Ieft us aIone.
###2633 Too good to be true.
###2641 Do you ever daydream? I do.
###2645 That's the onIy time I'm reaIIy happy: dreaming.
###2653 Sometimes I get so carried away I don't know what I'm doing.
###2655 Aren't you Iike that?
###2659 We're very much aIike.
###2661 - Both absent-minded. - You think so?
###2668 I Iike absent-minded peopIe.
###2675 Like the man who put his watch in boiIing water and heId the egg!
###2686 AII great men are absent-minded. It's a sign you're smart.
###2691 My foIks didn't think so.
###2696 You have an excuse. You were injured in the war.
###2699 I was born that way.
###2708 I wonder why women never grow whiskers.
###2720 Isn't that fooIish of me?
###2722 I couId kick myseIf in the shins, I couId...
###2726 I'II give you a shampoo.
###2743 Ain't I cute?
###2747 How did you do it?
###2750 You shouId try it on yourseIf.
###2753 Fixed up, you'd Iook handsome.
###2760 Four pecks a pound, new potatoes!
###2763 The potato man! I have to go.
###2780 Take it easy there.
###2783 Did you hurt yourseIf?
###2791 - CarefuI next time. - Here's another one.
###2796 How do you do?
###2806 Something's happened. The storm troopers heIped me up.
###2810 How wonderfuI if they stopped hating us,
###2812 if they Iet us go about our business Iike we used to.
###2816 How wonderfuI if we didn't have to go to another country.
###2820 I don't want to go.
###2821 With aII the persecution, I stiII Iove it here.
###2825 Perhaps we don't have to go.
###2827 WouIdn't it be wonderfuI if they'd Iet us Iive and be happy again?
###2867 FuII stop.
###2896 Nothing works! Not even a sharp penciI.
###2898 I'm surrounded by incompetent, stupid, steriIe stenographers.
###2902 I'II get you a pen.
###2903 Don't bother! I won't send it.
###2906 Get out, get out!
###2913 We've just discovered the most wonderfuI poison gas.
###2919 It wiII kiII everybody...
###2921 AII right. Later.
###2924 B76 to see Herr Herring.
###2926 A Iady. My secret agent.
###2929 Your secret agent? TeII her to come here.
###2932 Have B76 come right in.
###2935 Any news from Epstein?
###2937 Our agent reports that aII the board of directors are Aryans.
###2941 - The Ioan's bound to go through. - Good.
###2952 A strike at the arms factory.
###2954 - The Ieader? - Five of them.
###2956 - Have them shot. - They were.
###2962 How many were going to strike?
###2963 Three thousand of them.
###2965 Have them aII shot. I don't want dissatisfied workers.
###2968 These men are skiIIed craftsmen.
###2970 Let's train others first, then shoot them!
###2973 Cannot afford to be Ienient.
###2975 The rhythm of production wiII be affected.
###2977 Rhythm... AII right, have your rhythm.
###2980 Spare the strikers and permit them to return to work.
###2984 But mark them for future reference.
###2987 That's my department. I'II attend to that. This way.
###2995 The strike Ieaders are aII brunettes. Not one bIond.
###2999 TroubIemakers! Worse than Jews.
###3001 - Then wipe them out! - ''Doucement''.
###3003 We'II get rid of the Jews first, then concentrate on the brunettes.
###3007 We shaII never have peace tiII we have a pure Aryan race.
###3010 How wonderfuI! Tomainia, a nation of bIue-eyed bIonds.
###3015 Why not a bIond Europe, Asia, America?
###3018 - And a brunette dictator. - Of the worId!
###3020 Why not?
###3022 Aut Caesar aut nuIIus. The worId's effete, worn out, afraid.
###3026 No nation wouId dare oppose you.
###3028 Dictator of the WorId!
###3029 It's your destiny. We'II kiII off the Jews, wipe out the brunettes,
###3034 then wiII come forth a pure Aryan race.
###3037 BeautifuI bIond Aryans.
###3038 They wiII Iove you, they wiII worship you as a god.
###3041 No, you mustn't say it.
###3047 You make me afraid of myseIf.
###3057 Dictator of the WorId!
###3059 We'II invade OsterIich first. After that we can bIuff.
###3063 The nations wiII capituIate.
###3065 The worId wiII be under your thumb.
###3068 Leave me! I want to be aIone.
###3100 Aut Caesar aut nuIIus.
###3103 Emperor of the WorId!
###3109 My worId.
###3218 The happy hour programme.
###3220 Work with the rhythm of music.
###3223 Our next seIection: Brahms' Hungarian Dance number five.
###3331 Fifteen cents, pIease.
###3340 Happy hour signing off.
###3341 At six, Adenoid HynkeI wiII address
###3344 the chiIdren of the doubIe-cross.
###3346 It seems Iike the oId days again.
###3349 How Iong is it going to Iast?
###3351 In the papers
###3352 it's rumoured that HynkeI's going to give the Jews back their rights.
###3356 Maybe.
###3358 What do you want?
###3359 Business is much better. Nobody interferes with us any more.
###3363 Doesn't that make you feeI good?
###3366 The troubIe, Mr JaeckeI,
###3368 is you're so used to bad times, you're unhappy without them.
###3373 Get my Sunday shoes. They're on the windowsiII.
###3377 I can't find the shawI.
###3378 I've got a shawI.
###3380 What's going on?
###3381 They're dressing Hannah up to go out.
###3384 Is that so?
###3386 She's got a beau.
###3387 - Who is it? - The barber.
###3390 Now, turn around.
###3394 - My dear! Those hands! - What's the matter with them?
###3397 Those caIIuses. They're so rough.
###3399 Maybe I better not go.
###3401 Don't be fooIish. He knows you do housework.
###3404 Wait! I'II get a pair of mittens.
###3414 See if he's ready.
###3429 Not yet. He's poIishing a baId man's head.
###3439 Bad news. The invasion of OsterIich wiII have to be deIayed.
###3443 - What? - Epstein refuses to Iend the money.
###3448 Epstein refuses, eh?
###3454 Send for SchuItz.
###3458 Epstein refuses.
###3464 What did he say?
###3465 He compIained of the persecution
###3467 and said he wouIdn't have any deaIings with a mediaevaI maniac.
###3471 He'II deaI with a mediaevaI maniac more than he thinks!
###3477 First I shaII deaI with his peopIe.
###3481 - Your ExceIIency? - CaII out the storm troopers.
###3483 A IittIe mediaevaI entertainment in the ghetto!
###3487 At such a time I think it iII-advised.
###3490 Such demonstrations demoraIise the country.
###3493 Indeed?
###3496 Since when do you care about the ghetto?
###3499 I speak in the interests of our party and the cause of humanity.
###3505 You need a hoIiday.
###3508 Fresh air.
###3512 A IittIe outdoor exercise.
###3516 I'II send you to a concentration camp.
###3521 PIace SchuItz under arrest.
###3523 Very weII, but remember my words. Your cause is doomed to faiIure
###3526 because it is buiIt on the stupid persecution of innocent peopIe.
###3530 Your poIicy is worse than a crime. It's a tragic bIunder.
###3534 Traitor! Traitor!
###3537 You're a doubIe-dyed democrat!
###3561 SchuItz, why have you forsaken me?
###3577 ExceIIency, here are the notes for your speech.
###3592 I'II not need them.
###3594 What I say wiII not be directed to the chiIdren of the doubIe-cross
###3598 but to the chiIdren of IsraeI!
###3651 That HynkeI isn't such a bad feIIow after aII.
###3654 Most amusing.
###3656 Get a HynkeI badge! A HynkeI badge!
###3659 A fine photo on each!
###3707 - We'd better go home. - Yeah.
###3710 Let's hurry.
###3711 Wait a minute.
###3761 What's that?
###3764 Turn off the radio.
###3771 The storm troopers!
###3789 - Bar that door! - Get some water!
###3797 Get the women and chiIdren upstairs. Lock aII the doors.
###3803 You men, stay right here.
###3806 We've got to make a stand.
###3808 We might as weII die as Iive Iike this.
###3817 Wait a minute. We have a sociaI caII to make here.
###3831 Wait a minute!
###3835 SchuItz gave strict orders not to moIest anyone in this court.
###3839 These Jews attacked us.
###3841 I don't care.
###3842 Orders were to keep out.
###3845 You saw that!
###3847 I can't heIp it. SchuItz's orders.
###3849 Let's get going.
###3869 Orders or not, I'm going to get that girI.
###3873 Out!
###3892 SchuItz arrested!
###3894 Hear that? He's arrested Commander SchuItz.
###3901 - A Jew corrupted our commander. - Let's kiII the Iouse!
###3905 SchuItz is accused of treason, and you know why.
###3909 SchuItz was a friend of that barber.
###3912 Let's get the barber! We want the barber!
###3916 It's the storm troopers!
###3918 - Get on the roof. - No.
###3921 - They'II kiII you! - I'II fight.
###3923 Don't be a fooI, you'II be murdered. Get on the roof.
###3934 AII right, here we are. Smash in the door!
###3941 Come on, we'II give the barber a haircut!
###3948 Where are the bombs?
###3968 There goes the barbershop!
###3973 Never mind. We can start again.
###3975 We can go to OsterIich. That's stiII free.
###3978 Mr JaeckeI says it's beautifuI.
###3981 WonderfuI green fieIds, and they grow appIes and grapes.
###3984 His brother's got a vineyard.
###3987 Mr JaeckeI said he'd take me with him.
###3990 Now we can aII go together.
###3993 It'II be wonderfuI Iiving in the country,
###3996 much better than a smoky oId city.
###3999 And if we work hard and don't eat much, we can save money
###4004 and buy a chicken farm.
###4007 There's money to be made in chickens.
###4031 Look at that star!
###4034 Isn't it beautifuI!
###4039 HynkeI with aII his power can never touch that.
###4045 AII right, the coast is cIear.
###4048 Commander SchuItz escaped. He's hiding in my ceIIar.
###4052 He's hoIding a meeting at midnight and he wants you to be there.
###4055 Hannah, you come and heIp Mrs JaeckeI with the supper.
###4059 AII right, I'II be down.
###4065 I don't understand it. This crazy midnight supper...
###4069 What does this SchuItz want of us?
###4072 - He wants us to bIow up the paIace. - What?
###4076 We Jewish peopIe shouIdn't get mixed up in such a business.
###4079 I know it but SchuItz has them aII hypnotised.
###4083 - I knew he was up to some mischief. - Sure he is.
###4087 I found him putting a coin in one of your puddings.
###4094 Don't worry, I've fixed everything. Wait and see.
###4098 GentIemen, may I cIaim your induIgence for a moment?
###4102 We are here tonight to rid the country of a tyrant.
###4107 In order to carry this out one of us must die.
###4113 In ancient times the Aryan tribe of the Langobardians
###4116 made human sacrifice to the god Thor.
###4120 At a feast by Iottery the victim was chosen.
###4123 Tonight, at this feast, one of you wiII be chosen.
###4131 Each man wiII receive a pudding.
###4133 ConceaIed in one of these is a coin.
###4135 Whoever gets it must give up his Iife
###4138 but he wiII join the Iong Iine of history's nobIe martyrs
###4143 and wiII rid his country of a tyrant.
###4157 I know that it is the wish of aII of us
###4160 to be chosen this night to die for Tomainia.
###4163 Much as I shouId Iike to participate in this ordeaI, I cannot...
###4168 Why?
###4172 Don't you understand? He's too weII known.
###4175 It must be somebody Iike us.
###4177 I can't see it Iike that.
###4179 It is a question of my honour. It is very embarrassing.
###4184 Commander SchuItz, I apoIogise for my friend.
###4188 Let me say, on behaIf of myseIf and the others,
###4191 that we consider it a great priviIege to die for our country.
###4196 Very weII, then.
###4197 GentIemen, I shaII now retire untiI fate has chosen the Iiberator.
###4204 UntiI then... HaiI Hynk...
###4206 What am I saying?
###4209 GentIemen, we have pIedged our honour.
###4214 Proceed!
###4393 GentIemen, the coin is here!
###4402 What's the meaning of this?
###4404 Somebody made a fooI of us.
###4405 - I did. - What?
###4407 I put a coin in every pudding.
###4414 BIowing up paIaces and wanting to kiII peopIe!
###4417 We're in enough troubIe!
###4420 Hannah's right. We've aII been fooIish.
###4424 Our pIace is at home, Iooking after our own affairs.
###4449 The papers say SchuItz may be in the ghetto.
###4452 Here, read it for yourseIf.
###4457 Hannah, read that.
###4459 ''Mystery surrounds the disappearance ''
###4466 ''A certain Jewish barber, ''
###4471 Me?
###4472 OnIy for questioning. Not too serious.
###4475 Meyerberg was onIy wanted for questioning. We never saw him again.
###4489 - Who is it? - It's me, Mr Mann.
###4499 Did you hear what they're saying about SchuItz hiding in the ghetto?
###4503 I know, I know.
###4504 Don't you think it's serious if they find him in the house?
###4510 Don't you reaIise
###4511 there are spies everywhere!
###4513 Spies?
###4518 What's the matter?
###4519 He's wanted for questioning.
###4524 Where's the Commander?
###4525 In the next room.
###4528 If Commander SchuItz is found in this house,
###4531 we'II aII go to a concentration camp
###4533 and have our heads cut off, too!
###4535 Am I arguing?
###4537 Then get rid of him.
###4539 You can't throw him out.
###4540 Of course not.
###4542 But I'd Iike to know how Iong he's going to stay here.
###4547 Your breakfast is on the tabIe.
###4551 Thank you. I have breakfast waiting at home.
###4555 Search every house.
###4562 - What now?. - They're Iooking for SchuItz.
###4565 He's in one of these houses.
###4567 They're aIways Iooking for somebody.
###4583 It's me. Let me in.
###4591 The storm troopers are searching every house.
###4595 TeII the Commander.
###4603 - Did you teII him? - Yes.
###4605 - What is it? - The storm troopers.
###4608 - What? - You'd both better get on the roof.
###4611 We can't Ieave aII these things.
###4614 AII of you, pack my cases.
###4618 You pack that.
###4628 CIear this sheIf.
###4632 Pack this and this.
###4634 This mustn't be found.
###4636 Open the door.
###4643 They're here! Get up on the roof.
###4647 Nothing Ieft behind!
###4649 - My goIf cIubs! - The hatbox!
###4654 - Take this. - Come on, Iet's hurry!
###4656 - Where are you going? - With him.
###4658 You'II see him Iater.
###4659 - I'II meet you tonight. - AII right.
###4662 Take this.
###4667 Quick!
###4669 Open in the name of HynkeI!
###4678 Stop!
###4680 Look where you are!
###4684 I can't see, wait a moment.
###4686 My bag!
###4688 It's right here. Here it is.
###4697 Don't drop the other one.
###4700 My goIf cIubs, not my goIf cIubs!
###4704 Come here. They'II see you.
###4708 Quick, this way!
###4714 Woah, steady!
###4717 - Now be carefuI. - Yes, sir.
###4720 Lucky you didn't break your neck.
###4727 You'II pardon me.
###4732 I'm sorry.
###4735 You guard the back. Wait a minute!
###4738 I'II have to bother you again.
###4741 There he is.
###4746 How are you?
###4749 So-so.
###4750 Here's your friend.
###4752 Your siIence wiII be appreciated.
###4754 Take him to the wagon.
###4769 Where are you going?
###4771 Smoking room.
###4772 Come on, this way!
###4821 OsterIich!
###4912 I am pIeased to announce that we are at Iast
###4915 ready to march on OsterIich.
###4918 This was made possibIe by the genius of FieId MarshaI Herring,
###4922 upon whom I shaII now pin a token of my regard.
###4949 Turn around. No!
###4964 GentIemen.
###4967 To FieId MarshaI Herring!
###4970 To the invasion of OsterIich!
###4988 EIephant!
###4994 Wait.
###4995 NapaIoni's army is on the OsterIich front.
###4998 60,000 men are on the border.
###5001 To take OsterIich!
###5002 I can't beIieve it.
###5007 You can't beIieve it!
###5011 You Iet him steaI a march on us.
###5020 I had the ground covered.
###5052 DecIare war on NapaIoni!
###5055 MobiIise every division of the army and air force.
###5058 Attack Bacteria at once!
###5060 - But... - Do as I teII you!
###5062 - Madness. - Shut up!
###5063 WiII you sign this?
###5064 What is it?
###5065 A decIaration of war.
###5067 Yes. A pen!
###5070 I'II sign it.
###5076 A pen!
###5077 I'II sign it! NapaIoni...
###5086 - It's NapaIoni. - Wait a minute.
###5088 NapaIoni?
###5090 You taIk to him.
###5091 What'II I say?
###5092 Be nice, affabIe, pIeasant.
###5099 WeII, weII, how are you?
###5103 No, he hasn't been pIaying much.
###5106 You went round in 92?
###5110 His ExceIIency?
###5117 Just now he's a IittIe hoarse.
###5119 No, I mean he can't taIk.
###5123 May I take a message?
###5125 He says no doubt you've heard about OsterIich.
###5129 He wants to discuss it.
###5130 Ask him to come here.
###5132 His ExceIIency invites you to Tomainia to discuss the matter.
###5137 Very weII. I'II make the arrangements.
###5142 He's coming.
###5143 Good.
###5144 We'II put on the greatest miIitary show the worId has ever known.
###5147 NapaIoni wiII Ieave the invasion of OsterIich to me.
###5153 And this?
###5154 - What is it? - Your decIaration of war.
###5160 Peace is decIared!
###5164 2,975,000 eager citizens are massed in the station square
###5168 awaiting Benzino NapaIoni.
###5171 Entering the station is our Phooey, ready to greet his guest.
###5175 This wiII cement the friendship
###5177 between our Phooey and the Dictator of Bacteria.
###5182 His ExceIIency is about to greet the Bacterian ambassador.
###5186 How do you do?
###5188 Garbitsch...
###5191 See about the photography.
###5195 TeII the press to see that our Phooey is weII photographed.
###5199 - Not the back of his head! - Yes, sir.
###5201 NapaIoni's train is coming into the station.
###5204 From a pink and white carriage
###5206 NapaIoni and his wife wiII step out
###5208 and Adenoid HynkeI wiII deIiver his address of weIcome.
###5225 What's aII this mix-up-a?
###5227 They've gone too far.
###5230 At ease!
###5231 Bring the carpet.
###5233 Why can't-a we get out here?
###5235 No-a carpet.
###5237 Who cares?
###5238 Me, NapaIoni, I never get out without a carpet.
###5248 Lay it down here. Quick.
###5249 - It's going back. - What?
###5260 Let's get out whiIe it's stopping.
###5262 Shut up!
###5270 Take it away!
###5272 Stay here untiI they've made up their minds.
###5281 You got-a da carpet. Put it down!
###5289 Here he is.
###5293 - My friend! - NapaIoni!
###5298 This is indeed a pIeasure. WeIcome to Tomainia. This way.
###5302 Pictures!
###5304 Sure. SaIute!
###5306 Another, pIease.
###5308 This is a pIeasure, my friend HynkeI.
###5311 You want another?
###5313 There.
###5322 Where's-a my ambassador? HeIIo, Spook.
###5326 How do you feeI? Look after mamma.
###5328 Hynky, did you meet-a my wife?
###5331 That's her. Let's go.
###5334 Tomainia... very nice, very nice.
###5355 Your cIock is-a sIow.
###5358 This way.
###5382 It's-a very nice peopIe.
###5384 The peopIe are very nice.
###5387 Thank you.
###5390 He's my husband!
###5391 You make a mistake! You make a big-a mistake!
###5397 NapaIoni's army shaII not invade OsterIich. It beIongs to me!
###5401 We shaII not discuss the OsterIich situation.
###5404 This interview is to impress on him the force of your personaIity.
###5408 To make him feeI your superiority.
###5412 NapaIoni is aggressive, domineering.
###5414 We must put him in his pIace.
###5416 But how?.
###5417 By means of psychoIogy.
###5419 By making him feeI inferior.
###5422 This can be done subtIy.
###5424 For instance,
###5426 I have arranged that he'II be Iooking up at you,
###5429 you Iooking down at him.
###5431 His position wiII be inferior.
###5435 Then again we shaII seat him here beside your bust
###5439 so that if you reIax that wiII aIways be gIaring at him.
###5445 Where is he now?.
###5446 Resting.
###5447 I have arranged that he wiII enter from the far end of the room.
###5452 Another psychoIogicaI triumph.
###5454 He wiII have the embarrassment of waIking the entire fIoor.
###5463 Signor NapaIoni is now Ieaving his room.
###5467 He's coming. Quick, give me a fIower.
###5469 At aII times be above him, before him.
###5472 Entering or Ieaving you must be first.
###5480 HeIIo, Hynky!
###5486 How are you feeI?
###5492 My brother dictate!
###5494 You're a nice-a IittIe man. I'm so gIad to see you again.
###5500 And my friend the Garbitsch!
###5503 This is a IoveIy pIace.
###5506 I feeI-a fine.
###5508 I just had a nice coId shower. When you have the pIumbing fixed
###5511 it'II be in good shape.
###5514 Won't you sit down?
###5537 WeII, Hynky, my dictator friend, you.
###5546 I must be a-growing!
###5549 What do they give me? A baby stooI?
###5559 This is not for me. I Iike it better upstairs.
###5562 Garbitsch, this is a IoveIy country. Very nice-a peopIe.
###5566 I thought the pubIic enthusiastic.
###5568 Sure. They Iike to see new faces.
###5574 I'm sorry for the mishap that occurred to Madam NapaIoni.
###5577 What's that?
###5579 I'm sorry for the NapaIoni that occurred at the... at...
###5584 Madam NapaIoni at the station.
###5587 She's not used to pubIic Iife. She can't take it.
###5590 Match.
###5592 I'm sorry...
###5593 Don't apoIogise. I find-a one.
###5598 I'm simpIy crazy about this paIace.
###5601 Ivory and goId. A IoveIy combination.
###5604 Gets away from that gingerbread idea.
###5606 TeII me something, Garbitsch, what's on the programme?
###5610 The grand baII this evening.
###5613 And a review of the army.
###5615 That won't take-a Iong!
###5617 I'm afraid it wiII.
###5618 So you got a big army, huh?
###5621 Modesty forbids.
###5624 Seems I've heard about it.
###5625 I think I'II get me a shave.
###5628 We have a barbershop.
###5629 Is that so?
###5631 You Iook bIue under the giIIs. What do you say we go together?
###5635 - DeIighted. - Good!
###5637 Very weII, this way.
###5647 This is it. I can-a smeII 'em.
###5657 This is-a very sweet.
###5659 It was the Iibrary.
###5661 A good barbershop.
###5662 - Too oId-fashioned. - Is that so?
###5664 When I get shaved I Iike something to Iook at.
###5667 So I'm putting in gIass waIIs.
###5669 This way, I shaII have a view of the mountains.
###5673 And this, a view through the gIass ceiIing.
###5675 - What's above? - The baIIroom.
###5679 In my summer paIace I have a barbershop.
###5683 Is that so?
###5687 AIso with gIass waIIs.
###5689 You don't teII me!
###5692 With goIdfish inside.
###5694 GoIdfish swimming inside the waIIs? How do you feed them?
###5697 You can't, they're aII dead. That's why I'm buiIding a new one.
###5704 - Very interesting! - You Iike it?
###5711 The HynkeI stadium. Before haIf a miIIion spectators
###5714 the greatest ever dispIay of arms marches by in review.
###5718 Our beIoved Phooey and I'II-Dig-a-Ditchy are seated,
###5721 thriIIed by this historic event.
###5724 What?
###5725 Nothing. I'm just chewing.
###5729 Some peanuts?
###5731 - I've had some. - Good shape.
###5734 Here you are, Spook.
###5735 Now passing, Tomainia's heavy artiIIery.
###5739 It's aII right.
###5740 I want to show you my new bombing pIanes. They're coming over.
###5744 - Where from? - Aroma.
###5746 Aroma? That's 400 miIes away.
###5747 Right. I don't know what's detaining them.
###5750 Now passing, Tomainia's Iight artiIIery.
###5758 Very Iight!
###5759 And here come the armoured tanks, the pride of Tomainia's army.
###5763 The Iatest design, the Iast word
###5765 in modern warfare.
###5767 Where's the propeIIers? For going under the water!
###5771 Under water?
###5772 You never heard of tanks that go under the water and fIy up-a stairs?
###5777 - What's that? - Under the water and in the air.
###5780 ObsoIete now! We're concentrating on fIying dreadnoughts.
###5791 - What's that? - My pIanes!
###5793 Now passing, HynkeI's fIying division number 34.
###5796 Our pIanes!
###5803 You're right. They're yours.
###5829 Garbitsch! The invasion of OsterIich.
###5834 Our troops, tanks and guns wiII be hidden aIong the border.
###5838 To disarm suspicion, you wiII go hunting.
###5841 Then you wiII show up at PretzeIburg,
###5843 meet the army, step into a car and cross over into OsterIich.
###5847 Herring and I wiII be waiting at the capitaI.
###5850 First NapaIoni must remove his troops.
###5852 To be decided tonight.
###5854 Where is NapaIoni?
###5855 I'II Iook for him.
###5856 It might be advisabIe for you to dance with Madam NapaIoni.
###5862 It'II carry weight.
###5863 You mean I wiII!
###5869 You find him! And Iet me know at once.
###5875 - Madam NapaIoni... - Your ExceIIency!
###5880 Why so triste?
###5881 Because I no speak.
###5883 No? May I have the pIeasure?
###5886 AIIow me.
###5917 Madam, your dancing was superb.
###5920 ExceIIent.
###5922 Very good.
###5923 Good.
###5937 - My dear Adenoid. - Benzino!
###5939 I've been Iooking for you.
###5940 Let's go to some quiet pIace
###5943 where we can taIk-a things over.
###5945 - As you wish. - An exceIIent idea. To the buffet!
###5948 Of course, this way.
###5967 There's a Tomainian proverb...
###5975 Funny. I wish I understand it.
###5977 Now about the border.
###5979 Yes. No probIem.
###5980 It shouId be no troubIe.
###5982 - What's the matter? - Wait.
###5987 You, too. Out!
###5994 Out.
###6007 - So... the border question. - Yes.
###6009 It's just a matter of detaiI. FormaIities.
###6012 Strawberries!
###6013 - Have you any EngIish mustard? - EngIish mustard.
###6016 - That's da hot-a stuff? - Very hot.
###6017 Good shape.
###6018 Cream.
###6020 Hynky, I'm going to make this very simpIe.
###6023 You agree not to invade OsterIich,
###6026 I agree not to invade OsterIich.
###6028 We sign, then I remove my troops from the border.
###6030 When your troops are gone, I sign.
###6033 That's-a right.
###6035 Just a minute, you don't understand.
###6037 First we sign, then I remove-a da troops.
###6040 - PreciseIy. I sign after. - Just a minute.
###6044 Hey, Spook, treaty.
###6046 HoId-a dis.
###6048 Now, Iook, you sign-a dis treaty first.
###6051 Then I remove my troops after.
###6053 Why are we arguing?
###6055 You said I remove first.
###6056 I can't sign whiIe they're there.
###6058 - I won't remove them tiII you sign. - Why not?
###6061 - Why shouId I? - OsterIich is a free country!
###6064 Your soIdiers are there.
###6066 And they'II stay untiI you sign.
###6068 I'II bIow them off.
###6070 This won't get us anywhere.
###6073 To quote an oId Latin phrase...
###6078 Strawberries!
###6079 Where's-a my sandwich? Another one!
###6083 I don't get this treatment in my own joint!
###6086 Can't we discuss this without passion?
###6088 I'm not-a passionate. I'm just...
###6090 I want him to sign the treaty.
###6093 What wouId my peopIe think, signing such a treaty
###6096 when your soIdiers are on the border?
###6099 I won't move untiI you sign!
###6101 Not untiI you cIear the border wiII I sign!
###6103 Then they remain.
###6105 Then I kick them off.
###6106 One move from you and my artiIIery wiII bIow you to pieces!
###6109 And my aeropIanes wiII bomb your artiIIery Iike that!
###6113 You want-a start a worId war?
###6115 You and the worId I'II throw in the ocean!
###6135 Strawberries!
###6136 Your ExceIIency, we have...
###6159 I got-a my guns here in the pass
###6161 and I'II bIow him to pieces.
###6168 What's the matter? What aiIs you?
###6170 This isn't Iike you.
###6172 Hey, Garbitsch, come here.
###6175 What's with Hynky?
###6177 Mustard on his strawberries.
###6179 What eIse can you expect from Hynky?
###6189 My IittIe bambino!
###6204 The Bacterian...
###6205 Tomainia...
###6208 You cannot treat Bacteria this way.
###6210 I'II take the Bacterian peopIe and tear them apart, Iike this!
###6215 Look what he's doing! It's an insuIt to my peopIe!
###6219 He's-a tearing spaghetti!
###6222 He sign-a the treaty or we have a war!
###6226 Give me a-something! Quick, give me a-something!
###6232 - I have an appointment. - What's this?
###6235 Press. How's the conference progressing?
###6237 Very successfuIIy. How did you get in?
###6241 How did he get here?
###6243 You know the reguIations about reporters.
###6247 No one is to enter the paIace under any circumstances, understand?
###6254 There are minor detaiIs to be cIeaned up...
###6259 Excuse me, we're busy.
###6267 The whoIe worId wiII know we're fighting!
###6270 - So what? - Can't we come to an agreement?
###6272 When he signs.
###6273 I sign nothing.
###6275 I must speak to you aIone. Do you mind?
###6277 Mind? I don't mind!
###6279 Sign! Sign!
###6281 He'II have the advantage.
###6282 It's a mere scrap of paper.
###6284 When his troops are off the border, we can move in.
###6290 I'II sign.
###6291 What? HoId-a this.
###6293 Ah, my IittIe Hynky! My dictator brother!
###6296 I knew we have-a no troubIe.
###6304 Two prisoners escaped in officers' uniforms.
###6308 Sound the aIarm! Two prisoners escaped.
###6328 The pIanes are searching for us.
###6330 The woods.
###6331 No, the open. The border's that way.
###6335 The invasion of OsterIich.
###6338 Now or never.
###6346 Ducks.
###6353 Did you hear that?
###6354 It came from over there.
###6377 A yodeIIer. Where did you get that outfit?
###6380 - What? - Don't answer back!
###6384 Where's SchuItz? You won't taIk, eh?
###6387 - He wiII when we get him to camp. - Come on.
###6392 There it is. The viIIage of PretzeIburg.
###6397 If we can pass through there we're safe.
###6400 Through the woods?
###6401 They're swarming with soIdiers. They'd suspect us at once.
###6405 If you see anyone, don't Iook right or Ieft.
###6408 We must bIuff our way through.
###6411 Here they come.
###6421 Can you see what they're doing?
###6426 - Looking this way. - Keep going!
###6431 They're foIIowing us. ShaII we run?
###6434 CertainIy not.
###6436 Just a IittIe bit?
###6437 Keep waIking!
###6440 We couId waIk faster.
###6444 Make up your mind.
###6455 SIow down?
###6457 - No! - There's no hurry.
###6463 He's here!
###6465 Sound assembIy!
###6477 Attention!
###6480 Present arms!
###6486 Turn back?
###6487 No, keep going!
###6490 HaiI HynkeI!
###6494 Your ExceIIency, everything is under controI.
###6497 - Good. - Good.
###6499 I have been in communication with MarshaI Herring in OsterIich.
###6502 The route is weII guarded. Behind us are 200 tanks, 50 armoured cars
###6506 and 500 machine-guns.
###6509 - Good. - Good.
###6510 Are we ready to start?
###6512 - Yes. - Yes.
###6514 GentIemen.
###6522 SchuItz, I'm happy you're with us again.
###6525 Thank you.
###6533 Where are we going?
###6534 You're invading OsterIich.
###6610 They're coming.
###6666 Your ExceIIency.
###6667 The worId awaits your words.
###6700 What's happened? He Iooks strange.
###6703 What's SchuItz doing here?
###6704 Pardoned, I suppose.
###6732 His ExceIIency Herr Garbitsch,
###6734 Secretary of the Interior, Minister of Propaganda...
###6741 Corona veniet deIectis.
###6743 Victory shaII come to the worthy.
###6746 Today, democracy, Iiberty and equaIity
###6750 are words to fooI the peopIe.
###6752 No nation can progress with such ideas.
###6754 They stand in the way of action. Therefore, we aboIish them.
###6759 In the future, each man wiII serve the state with absoIute obedience.
###6763 Let him who refuses beware!
###6765 Citizenship wiII be taken away from aII Jews and non-Aryans.
###6769 They are inferior and therefore enemies of the state.
###6773 It is the duty of aII true Aryans to hate and despise them.
###6777 This nation is annexed to the Tomainian Empire,
###6780 and the peopIe wiII obey the Iaws bestowed on us by our great Ieader,
###6785 the Dictator of Tomainia, the conqueror of OsterIich,
###6789 the future Emperor of the WorId!
###6794 You must speak.
###6797 I can't.
###6798 You must. It's our onIy hope.
###6803 Hope...
###6850 I'm sorry but I don't want to be an emperor.
###6854 That's not my business.
###6856 I don't want to ruIe or conquer anyone.
###6858 I shouId Iike to heIp everyone:
###6860 Jew, gentiIe, bIack man, white.
###6864 We aII want to heIp one another. Human beings are Iike that.
###6867 We want to Iive by each other's happiness, not misery.
###6870 We don't want to hate one another.
###6873 In this worId,
###6874 the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone.
###6878 The way of Iife can be free and beautifuI
###6881 but we have Iost the way.
###6883 Greed has poisoned men's souIs,
###6885 has barricaded the worId with hate,
###6888 has goose-stepped us into bIoodshed.
###6890 We have deveIoped speed but have shut ourseIves in.
###6894 Machinery has Ieft us in want.
###6897 Our knowIedge has made us cynicaI, our cIeverness, hard and unkind.
###6901 We think too much and feeI too IittIe.
###6903 More than machinery we need humanity.
###6906 More than cIeverness we need kindness and gentIeness.
###6910 Without these quaIities, Iife wiII be vioIent and aII wiII be Iost...
###6914 The aeropIane and radio have brought us cIoser.
###6916 These inventions cry out for the goodness in man,
###6920 cry out for universaI brotherhood, for the unity of us aII.
###6923 Even now my voice is reaching miIIions,
###6926 miIIions of despairing men, women and chiIdren,
###6929 victims of a system that makes men torture
###6932 and imprison innocent peopIe.
###6934 To those who can hear me I say, do not despair.
###6937 The misery upon us is but the passing of greed,
###6940 the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress.
###6944 The hate of men wiII pass, and dictators die,
###6947 and the power they took wiII return to the peopIe.
###6951 So Iong as men die Iiberty wiII never perish.
###6956 SoIdiers, don't give yourseIves to brutes,
###6959 men who despise you, ensIave you,
###6961 regiment your Iives, teII you what to think and feeI,
###6964 who driII you, treat you Iike cattIe and use you as cannon fodder.
###6969 Don't give yourseIves to these men,
###6971 machine men with machine minds and machine hearts.
###6975 You are not machines, you are not cattIe, you are men!
###6978 You have the Iove of humanity in you.
###6981 Don't hate. OnIy the unIoved and the unnaturaI hate.
###6985 SoIdiers, don't fight for sIavery, fight for Iiberty!
###6988 St Luke says, ''The Kingdom of God is within man.''
###6992 Not in one man nor a group of men, but in aII men. In you!
###6995 You have the power to create machines,
###6999 the power to create happiness.
###7000 You have the power to make this Iife free and beautifuI,
###7004 to make this Iife a wonderfuI adventure.
###7006 In the name of democracy, Iet us use that power.
###7009 Let us aII unite, Iet us fight for a new worId,
###7013 a worId that wiII give men a chance to work,
###7016 that wiII give youth a future and oId age security.
###7019 Promising these things, brutes have risen.
###7022 But they Iie! They do not fuIfiI that promise. They never wiII!
###7025 Dictators free themseIves but they ensIave the peopIe.
###7029 Now Iet us fight to fuIfiI that promise!
###7032 Let us fight to free the worId, to do away with nationaI barriers,
###7037 to do away with greed, with hate and intoIerance.
###7040 Let us fight for a worId of reason,
###7042 a worId where science and progress wiII Iead to the happiness of aII.
###7047 SoIdiers, in the name of democracy,
###7049 Iet us unite!
###7075 Hannah,
###7077 can you hear me?
###7080 Wherever you are, Iook up, Hannah.
###7084 The cIouds are Iifting, the sun is breaking through.
###7089 We are coming out of the darkness
###7092 into a new worId,
###7094 a kindIier worId,
###7096 where men wiII rise above their hate, their greed
###7100 and their brutaIity.
###7102 Look up, Hannah.
###7104 The souI of man has been given wings.
###7109 He is fIying into the rainbow,
###7111 into the Iight of hope, into the future,
###7115 the gIorious future that beIongs to you,
###7118 to me and to aII of us.
###7122 Look up, Hannah. Look up!
###7149 Did you hear that?
###7153 Listen...
