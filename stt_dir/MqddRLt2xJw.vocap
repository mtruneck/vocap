###13 Thank you very much; it's an honor to be here. Let's pray together. Father I ask that you
###22 would now grant that the eyes of our hearts would see, and that the taste buds of our
###30 souls would savor the supreme value of Jesus Christ. And that being so confident and so
###44 satisfied in Him, we would have the courage to lay down our lives, to take the gospel
###57 to the unreached peoples of the world, no matter what it costs. And so make Yourself
###68 beautiful in our eyes. A steadfast love of the Lord is better than life, better than
###76 life. I pray that every life in this room would feel that, really believe it, drive
###84 it down into the marrow of our bones: that You are more to be desired than life. I pray
###93 this in Jesus name, Amen.
###98 Standing beside the tomb of Lazarus, Jesus said to Martha, "I am the resurrection and
###106 the life, he who believes in me though he die, yet shall he live, and he who believes
###115 in me lives, shall never die." Do you believe that? You will never die! Never! You won't
###134 die! Jesus said so. He who lives and believes in me, will never die. Or chapter 6; that
###148 was chapter 11. Chapter 6: I am the bread of life, whoever comes to me will not hunger,
###155 and whoever believes in me will never thirst. This is the true bread that comes down from
###162 heaven. Which if one eats he will never die. Have you eaten? If you have eaten of the bread
###174 of Christ, if you have come to Christ who died for you, and rose again and lives triumphant
###180 if you have come to eat as the satisfaction of your souls, you'll never die. He said so.
###189 You will never be dead. Or chapter 8, he who keeps my word will never taste death. Ever.
###210 This is the root of love and courage that can finish the great commission at the cost
###220 of our lives. Paul said, one of my favorite passages in life, Philippians 1, it is my
###234 eager expectation and hope that I might not at all be ashamed but for now as always Christ
###242 would be magnified in my body whether by life or by death, for to me to live is Christ and
###250 to die is gain. Gain. Not death. It is not gain to be dead. When you die you will not
###262 be dead. Whether by life, or by death, for to me to live is Christ and to die is gain.
###276 To live in the flesh means fruitful labor for me, which I shall choose, I do not know.
###282 My desire is to depart and to be with Christ. For that is far better. So you wont be dead
###291 when you die, you will be far better. The steadfast love of the Lord is better than
###300 life. No Christian dies. Ever. Death has become, not a room into which you walk, not a dark
###313 field, it has become a door and the door is paper-thin so micro thin it has no dimension.
###327 You go through it without a millisecond in it. There will be no moment of death. You
###340 move from life to life with nothing in between. You do not give your godly one up to see the
###353 pit, nor let your holy one see destruction. You show me the path of life. In your presence
###361 is fullness of joy at your right hand are pleasures forevermore. That's what's on the
###366 other side of this thing called dying. Pleasures forevermore. There's nobody in this room who
###376 could offer me anything better. In fact, there's no one in this room or in this world who can
###383 even conceive of anything better than fullness of joy and pleasures at his right hand, forever.
###399 There's nothing fuller than full and there's nothing longer than forever. So if you come
###404 to me and say I have a better deal for you than following Jesus, I would say go ahead,
###412 try, and then you would say... and I would say, no comparison. Because there isn't anything
###418 fuller than full and there isn't anything longer than forever. And that's what I get
###426 in joy, in his presence the one who loved me and gave himself for me and rose triumphant
###432 over the grave and reigns as a king in heaven and will come again to make the world his
###437 own you can't improve upon it. Paul said in 1 Corinthians 3 don't boast in men all things
###450 are yours whether Paul or ____ or _____ the world or life or death. Or things present
###458 or things to come all things are yours you are Christ's and Christ is God's. Death is
###463 yours liberty students. Death is yours. It's your servant. It stands ready like an ugly
###476 handmaiden with a rough hand to lead you into everlasting pleasures. You will never die.
###493 You will spend now in fellowship with Jesus and then on the other side intensified fellowship
###500 with Jesus, growing in joy forever and ever. You cannot, and you will not, die. Here's
###517 the point: believing that, down into the marrow of your bones, which a lot of you do not,
###528 I can tell, and you know, that you're scared of little things, let alone, dying.
###537 But if God would be pleased to use your time at Liberty, and this little piece of it right
###543 now to drive that truth down into the marrow of your bones, it will become the root from
###553 which grows up a kind of radical love that will carry you into the face of opposition
###562 at the risk of your life, to bring Christ to the unreached peoples of the world. Confidence
###574 in fullness of joy and pleasures forevermore, in the presence of Jesus, on the other side
###584 of this so called dying is the root of love that is willing to lay down its life for the
###592 sake of the nations. This confidence that you cannot die but only have increased pleasures
###605 produces martyrs who die in love, not martyrs who kill in hate. And that's what I'm after.
###623 If you have a bible I invite you to turn to Hebrews chapter 10. I'm going to spend the
###631 rest of our time in Hebrews. And I'm going to try to prove from Hebrews the point that
###642 being totally, deeply, fully satisfied in the reward of pleasures at his right hand,
###658 and fullness of joy forever, being deeply satisfied in Christ as your supreme treasure
###666 forever is the motive power to lay down your life in love for the good of the nations.
###675 That's what I'm going to try to prove, and it's a very controversial statement because
###680 if you're studying philosophy you will know that there have been historical, wise philosophers
###687 who have said, "That is a defective motivation...you ought not do what's right for reward, you
###698 should do what's right because its right." That is an atheist talking. Right for rights
###709 sake is an atheistic statement. Right for Gods sake is a biblical statement. And when
###718 you analyze to the root what "for Gods sake" means, it doesn't mean doing him a favor.
###726 It means doing yourself a favor for His glory. You get the joy, he gets the credit. When
###733 you do right. That's what we're going to try to prove because it's very controversial.
###740 So there are four or five passages. It's amazing what you see in Hebrews, and I invite you
###745 to look first at 10:32: "Recall the former days when after you were enlightened and you
###756 endured a hard struggle with sufferings." So this is, they were converted, and as baby
###762 Christians they endured a hard struggle, sometimes being publicly exposed to reproach and affliction,
###774 and sometimes being partners with those so treated. If you got a picture of that on the
###780 platform this morning, right? We're not in prison. Sayeed is in prison. Says this, right
###789 here, verse 33, sometimes being partners with those so treated... what happened when they
###799 partnered, verse 34, you had compassion on those in prison and you joyfully accepted
###810 the plundering of your property. So what happened when they identified with the prisoners is
###819 that they got labeled as that kind of person and people plundered their property, or confiscated
###826 their property. That's what happens when you do compassion. That's what happens when you
###832 identify with the right. You might lose your property. Somebody might scribble, 'go home
###840 Christian' on the wall of your dorm room, or they might steal from you or they might
###848 malign you, or they might kill you.
###851 That's what happens in the cause of the mission. And did you notice that unbelievable word
###864 in verse 34... joyfully. You had compassion on those in prison and you joyfully accepted
###875 the plundering of your property. Now this is what I'm after here; I'm after miracles.
###881 This is a miracle. None of you is like this, in yourself. This is a miracle, somebody strips
###888 off everything you've got, rips off your car, rips off your iPhone, rips off everything
###894 you've got and instead of seething with anger, you rejoice. That's a miracle. That is crazy.
###909 How can that be? And the answer is in verse 34, at the end. Since you knew that you yourselves
###921 had a better possession and an abiding one. Does that sound familiar? Better and abiding.
###933 Full and forever. In your presence is fullness of joy; at your right hand are pleasures forevermore.
###945 You have a better possession. You have an abiding forever possession. What is an iPhone?
###957 What's a car? What's a life? You will never die; you will only have better, and abiding.
###970 That's where the joy came from, that's where the compassion came from. That's where the
###975 visit to the prison came from. And that's where it will come from today or it wont be
###981 Christian. These people didn't go to the prison and joyfully accept the plundering of their
###988 property out of raw duty. It's the right thing to do, that's what you're supposed to do;
###992 it says so in the book. That's not what the text says. The text says they joyfully did
###999 it because they knew they had a better possession and an abiding one. So that's text number
###1005 one from Hebrews, here's number two. Chapter 11 verse 24...By faith Moses, when he was
###1015 grown up refused to be called pharaohs daughter. I'm sorry, refused to be called the son. That
###1026 was a good thing not to be called Pharaoh's daughter. That's another sermon, invite me
###1033 back, I'll preach that one. Ok, lets try this again. By faith Moses, when he was grown up
###1045 refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter, choosing rather to be mistreated
###1054 with the people of God. This is craziness again right; this is just utter counterintuitive...choosing
###1067 rather to be mistreated with the people of God, than to enjoy the fleeting pleasures
###1074 of sin. Fleeting. The whole world lives for pleasure, right? The only difference is theirs
###1088 is fleeting, ours is forever. That's not the only difference. Ours is Jesus. So he checks
###1097 out and weighs in the balance all that Egypt could offer him, all that serving with a people
###1105 under their approach of Christ could offer him and he chooses the reproaches of Jesus.
###1112 Why? Verse 26, he considered the reproach of Christ, greater wealth. How are you doing?
###1125 Is being made fun of part of your treasure? If you love. He considered the reproach of
###1137 Christ greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt. How? For he was looking to the reward!
###1152 That's where it came from. The thesis of this message is if this reward, pleasures at your
###1159 right hand, joy forevermore, goes down into the marrow of your bones so that you know
###1165 instead of being dead I will be with Christ forever. Joy forever. That will become the
###1172 root of all your love of the people of God and the nations of the world, so that you
###1178 can embrace reproaches for the Christ and call them my wealth. This is just utterly
###1187 different from the world.
###1191 That's number two, here's number three. Verse 35, chapter 11, women receive back their dead
###1199 by resurrection. Oh yes, I believe in miracles of that kind too. And then, middle of verse
###1210 35, some were tortured, refusing to accept release, so that they might rise again to
###1223 a better life. Oh, where'd that come from? Where did that courage come from? No, I'm
###1232 not going to renounce Him! I'm not going to renounce Him to get out of jail. I would rather
###1238 rise to a better life, a better abiding joy. If you don't have that, you will cave. Keep
###1251 going. Verse 36, others suffered mocking and flogging and even chains and imprisonment.
###1257 They were stoned, they were sawn in two, they were killed with the sword. They went about
###1262 in skins of sheep and goats destitute, afflicted, mistreated, of whom the world was not worthy.
###1270 What does that mean? Of whom the world was not worthy. They're wearing skins and living
###1280 in caves. Of whom the world was not worthy. That means, they were a gift to the world,
###1292 and the world didn't deserve the gift. So that's what I want you to be. I want you to
###1301 be a gift to the world. And the world doesn't deserve you, it doesn't deserve you. You don't
###1312 go to the world, to the Muslim world, the Hindu world, the Buddhist world or the atheistic
###1318 world or the secular world. You don't go to the world because they deserved to have you
###1323 come. You go because Jesus went and because going there will lead you a full and abiding
###1338 reward in the presence of Christ. Chapter 12, verses 1 and 2, this may be the most important
###1348 one of all. I have two more. Therefore, chapter 12 of Hebrews, verses 1 and 2, therefore since
###1357 we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses let us also lay aside every weight and sin
###1364 which cling so closely and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us looking
###1370 to Jesus. Were looking to Jesus, the founder, and the perfector of our faith, who, for the
###1383 joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame and is seated at the right
###1394 hand throne of God.
###1398 Now the reason this may be the most important is because up until now I can imagine, thought
###1410 its hard, somebody saying the motivation that you're commending, namely looking to the reward
###1420 as a sustaining and motivation power for love is simply low and defective. It's a low motivation.
###1436 To move through persecution and through death into the presence of Jesus and experience
###1444 His fullness of joy and pleasures forevermore. That motivation for enduring this is low.
###1455 If you are thinking that, you are on the brink of blasphemy, because of verse two of Hebrews
###1462 12. Because you are about to say, Jesus Christ the Lord of the universe had a base low and
###1472 defective motivation on the cross. And he didn't. Here's his motivation: for the joy
###1485 that was set before him. Therefore God has given him the name which is above every name
###1496 that at the name of Jesus every knee will bow and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ
###1500 is Lord to the glory of God the father. That therefore at the beginning of verse 9 in Philippians
###1507 2 is based on he was obedient unto death even death on a cross he knew that. He knew that
###1515 was coming. Rising triumphant over death gathering millions and millions of people from every
###1524 tongue and tribe and nation, surrounded by them praising him forever triumphant over
###1530 all these enemies he knew that was coming and that hope stayed his hand and kept him
###1537 on the cross. He despised shame for the joy that was set before him. He looked at shame
###1547 and he said, "I despise you." Make my day shame. I put no stock in you. You don't govern
###1558 me shame. I embrace you, I own you. Strip me, kill me, bloody me, curse me, you mean
###1567 nothing to me. I have a reward coming beyond Sunday. For the joy that was set before him
###1583 he endured the cross despising the shame and was seated. So if Jesus was motivated to be
###1592 and stay on the cross for the joy that was set before him, you should be too. It is not
###1607 a low motivation; it is the highest motivation to want to be in the presence of God, in the
###1625 fullness joy taking as many with you as you can, is the highest of motivations. One more,
###1638 chapter 13 verse 12 to 14, so Jesus also suffered outside the gate in order to sanctify the
###1652 people through his own blood. Therefore, let us go to him, outside the camp and bare the
###1663 reproach that he endured. For here we have no lasting city, but we seek a city that is
###1674 to come.
###1680 So Liberty students, Jesus suffered outside the gate to sanctify you that is to make you
###1691 his own, to set you apart as a uniquely precious, holy possession of his own. It's why he died.
###1702 And now he says, join me because to do that I had to go outside the gate to the cross
###1710 and suffer and that's the way my mission will be completed. You know, among the unreached
###1718 peoples that are yet to be engaged and to be reached, most of them don't want you to
###1726 come. And if you don't have this mindset, that will be enough reason not to go. But
###1737 if you have this mindset, he will say well the Great Commission didn't say go make disciples
###1743 of all the nations except the ones that don't want you to come. All is all. You go to the
###1750 peoples, all of them. In there outside the camp they're in the hard places, they're behind
###1760 the hard cultures, they're behind hard languages, and they're behind hard attitudes towards
###1767 the west. Satan of the west. And we are called to go, so what's left to be done is the hardest
###1775 thing. You know, there are some wonderful mission stories about arriving there and through
###1781 it redemptive analogies of the whole tribe gets converted and you're a hero. That's a
###1786 rare story. A wonderful story, true story, but a rare story. God has a people among all
###1797 the peoples of the world and we go to call them out. Call them out. And it will cost
###1804 us our lives; it will cost many of you your lives. I don't know, I mean you're a very
###1809 young school, I don't know whether you have a list of martyrs yet. But one day there'll
###1814 be a wall; there'll be a wall here. And the pictures will be there. They went. We did
###1824 for the soldiers in the First and Second World War. Most churches, old churches have plaques
###1831 and their names are listed and they will be listed in churches, they'll be listed in schools.
###1837 And that's why I'm here; I want to recruit martyrs who die in love, not martyrs who kill
###1843 in hate. And I think that kind of love comes, I know it comes, from being satisfied in Jesus,
###1856 so deeply that you know you can't die. So look at, finally, verse 14, here's the ground
###1864 of going outside the camp and baring reproach with Jesus. For here we have no lasting city,
###1870 but we seek a city that is to come. The reason we are willing to go outside the camp and
###1878 suffer is because this world is not our home. We seek a city that is to come. Now here's,
###1884 I want to end on this because I know the kind of school I'm talking to here, and I love
###1890 what I see. Ninety percent of you, ninety five percent of you are here growing in knowledge
###1900 and skills that will enable you to serve this city, called the city of man. The city of
###1910 the world: this one. We have no lasting city. That non-lasting city is Lynchburg, its America,
###1923 it's the workplace. It won't last. And if anybody were to take my message about loving
###1934 our everlasting reward to mean you just skip the city and go to that, you've totally missed
###1941 the point. My point has been this: all the students at Liberty aiming to pour your life
###1951 into the city of man for her good, for her everlasting good will serve her better if
###1959 you love the other city more. If you love the city that is to come, the Lord that is
###1968 to come more than this city, you will serve this city better. You'll be able to be so
###1976 different from this city, so able to lay down your life for the good, the everlasting good
###1983 of this city that you will go to the hardest places on the planet and the hardest peoples
###1988 on the planet in order to make plain the value of that other city, and that other King.
###1997 Lets pray. Father in heaven, I ask now that these passages from Hebrews, John 11, and
###2008 John 6, and John 8 and 1 Corinthians 3, and Psalm 16 would be like a double edged sword
###2023 that penetrates into the hearts of everyone in this room for the sake of finishing the
###2030 Great Commission in the hardest places, among the hardest peoples of the world no matter
###2036 what it costs, because the steadfast love of the Lord in better than life. I ask this
###2043 in Jesus' name. Amen.
