###2 CHARLOT DUBOC: Welcome to "Fashion Week International,"
###5 a new show that reports on the most fabulous fashion weeks in
###8 the world, and the culture and politics behind them.
###11 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###18 CHARLOT DUBOC: Have you heard of Full Figured Fashion Week?
###21 FEMALE SPEAKER: Well, not really.
###23 FEMALE SPEAKER: No.
###24 FEMALE SPEAKER: What's that?
###25 FEMALE SPEAKER: No.
###26 FEMALE SPEAKER: No, I haven't.
###27 FEMALE SPEAKER: Full Figured Fashion Week,
###29 what does that mean?
###30 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###35 CHARLOT DUBOC: I was in New York for fashion week.
###37 No, not that one.
###38 The First Annual Full Figured Fashion Week.
###41 The dress size in the US is 14 and growing.
###45 Sick of fad diets and stretchy muumuu dresses designed to
###48 disguise their lady lumps, these women want to celebrate
###52 their shape with couture adaptations and sequins.
###56 I came here to investigate the extent to which the plus size
###59 industry is really empowering the fuller figured woman or if
###63 it's simply a case of cashing in on the fat dollar.
###65 
###68 So we're going to the runway competition to see a load of
###74 models from all over America.
###76 And they're going to just battle it out on the catwalk.
###80 Where are we going?
###80 Five.
###82 Here we go.
###84 Hey.
###86 How are you doing?
###87 
###90 FEMALE SPEAKER: So good to see you.
###91 MALE SPEAKER: Likewise.
###93 FEMALE SPEAKER: Thank you so much for coming.
###95 Put your hands together for these beautiful ladies who are
###97 going to rock the stage.
###99 [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
###101 FEMALE SPEAKER: Ladies, are you ready?
###103 [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
###105 FEMALE SPEAKER: Let me get some music.
###106 DJ, please.
###108 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###121 [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
###129 MALE SPEAKER: Somebody that wasn't full figured might do
###130 that and they probably would have broke down and cried.
###132 But her being so confident and her, she made it work.
###136 And it took a lot of guts and it took some
###138 fortitude to do that.
###140 And that's what it is.
###141 CHARLOT DUBOC: When you see that full figure on the cat
###143 walk, what happens?
###145 MALE SPEAKER: I just like their attitude.
###146 And it surprises me how confident they are in them
###149 self when society wants them to be something else.
###151 You know what I mean?
###152 And I'm glad that they embrace that.
###153 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###159 CHARLOT DUBOC: What are you looking for?
###160 What makes a winner?
###160 BRANDON: If you feel sexy, if you feel confident, if you
###163 feel curvy, then you can work the runway.
###164 With no matter whether you're a size 2 or a size 22, you can
###167 still do it.
###169 My name is Brandon Coats.
###170 And I'm here today.
###171 And I'm actually judging the full figured and fabulous
###173 competition.
###174 CHARLOT DUBOC: What do you think of this whole event?
###176 What do you think of full figured fashion week?
###178 BRANDON: Plus sized women for too long have been
###180 marginalized and not catered to.
###182 So here's actually a market where we celebrate plus sized
###185 women in all their fabulosity.
###186 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###191 CHARLOT DUBOC: So, hi.
###192 Your wife just won the competition.
###195 How do you feel?
###196 MALE SPEAKER: I'm a lucky man.
###198 I mean, not a lot of people can say that they're married
###200 to a model.
###200 Bigger is better.
###201 What can I say?
###202 [APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
###205 FEMALE SPEAKER: I am ecstatic.
###207 I mean, words can't really express exactly how I feel.
###211 I've worked so hard for this.
###213 You know, you can be full figured and healthy.
###217 CHARLOT DUBOC: One of the hilarious things that somebody
###218 said to me was, it's hard to be a full figured runway model
###221 because your thighs rub together and people don't
###224 realize that.
###225 [LAUGHTER]
###227 FEMALE SPEAKER: That is a problem.
###229 CHARLOT DUBOC: And did you feel emotional?
###231 MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, I did.
###232 I did.
###233 I'll cry later.
###234 CHARLOT DUBOC: But what--
###234 [INTERPOSING VOICES]
###234 MALE SPEAKER: Wait until it just becomes fashion, not full
###236 figured, not, you know, regular figured, just fashion.
###241 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###245 CHARLOT DUBOC: After a raucous start to the week, I went to
###247 find out a bit about the shopping
###248 options for these women.
###250 So we headed to a sample sale organized by the fashion week.
###254 What's this?
###255 Curves in the City Sample Sale.
###258 Oh. my god.
###258 So it's like "Sex in the City," but not at all like
###262 "Sex in the City."
###264 I don't know if I'm going to be the only empty figured
###272 person there.
###275 Hi.
###275 MALE SPEAKER: Good morning.
###276 CHARLOT DUBOC: This way is for the sample sale?
###278 MALE SPEAKER: Yes, it is.
###278 FEMALE SPEAKER: Yes.
###278 CHARLOT DUBOC: Thank you.
###279 [INTERPOSING VOICES]
###280 
###284 CHARLOT DUBOC: Over there's Brenda [INAUDIBLE]
###286 She's the organizer for the whole thing.
###288 We've heard she's a bit of a force to be reckoned with.
###291 Hi.
###291 I'm Charlot.
###292 FEMALE SPEAKER: Charlot, finally I got a
###293 chance to meet you.
###295 CHARLOT DUBOC: I wanted you to show us your favorite store.
###297 FEMALE SPEAKER: Oh.
###298 It's going to be hard to narrow that down, but I think
###300 I know just the person.
###301 CHARLOT DUBOC: Come on, then.
###302 FEMALE SPEAKER: Come on.
###302 Let's go shopping.
###303 This is the layer patch leather dress, which she has.
###307 This is the royal fishtail dress, which she has.
###310 This is the stormy mesh dress, which is fabulous.
###313 It could be worn in the summertime and wintertime,
###316 which she has.
###318 FEMALE SPEAKER: You just can't get this type of fashion in
###321 those sizes so readily available.
###324 With her, you just go online and it's there.
###325 FEMALE SPEAKER: Oh, anything with ruffles, flowers, that's
###327 all me right there.
###328 Oh, this is beautiful!
###330 FEMALE SPEAKER: Wear your curves.
###330 Love your curves.
###331 Show your curves.
###333 FEMALE SPEAKER: I wrote this book, "Stop Dieting Now." It
###336 really becomes the focus of your life when you're trying
###339 to lose weight all the time.
###340 Diets create anorexic thinking.
###342 And if you talk to someone who's had anorexia and you
###344 talk to someone who is dieting, the way they talk
###347 about food is very similar.
###348 The diet industry needs you to fail.
###351 But I also get a lot of backlash.
###353 CHARLOT DUBOC: What are the sort of negative things do
###355 people say?
###355 FEMALE SPEAKER: Everything from just repeating the same
###357 diet paradigm of like, well, it's just calories in,
###359 calories out.
###360 About you don't--
###361 You know, all that.
###362 To, you know, you should go die, you know.
###365 So, yeah.
###366 It's pretty crazy.
###369 FEMALE SPEAKER: Right now what you're looking at is our True
###372 Sheroes, plus size, curvy comic book.
###376 CHARLOT DUBOC: Are you here?
###377 FEMALE SPEAKER: And I'm here.
###378 CHARLOT DUBOC: That's you?
###379 What are your super powers?
###380 FEMALE SPEAKER: My super power is I get my
###382 powers from the sun.
###383 She gets hers from the gamma-ray bursts.
###385 Then you have one with the strength of 1,000 men.
###388 That's pretty much what we are.
###389 We're not a fat girl movement.
###391 We're all about the woman with curves.
###393 That's just who we are.
###394 CHARLOT DUBOC: Tell us what you've got on.
###395 It's really cute.
###397 FEMALE SPEAKER: OK.
###397 This is body jewelry.
###398 I don't know exactly what it is.
###400 CHARLOT DUBOC: So you're not supposed to wear it with
###402 nothing else?
###402 [LAUGHTER]
###405 FEMALE SPEAKER: Oh, my God.
###406 We're feeling fabulous.
###407 No, you always have an outfit under there, especially if
###410 you're under 21.
###411 But if you're over 21 and married like me and do it,
###413 it'll be just fine.
###414 Rock it!
###414 I say, rock it!
###415 [LAUGHTER]
###416 FEMALE SPEAKER: OK.
###416 I could tell you how you grow your tits.
###418 You and I can go together because I need to lift mine
###420 up, suck it out there.
###421 They're going to suck it out of me.
###423 Put it in you.
###424 FEMALE SPEAKER: Don't hate 'cause I just ate.
###427 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###434 CHARLOT DUBOC: We're going to the world's
###436 largest fitness class.
###437 It's called Walking Curves.
###440 I kind of didn't dress properly.
###442 But I'm going to do my best.
###445 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###448 CHARLOT DUBOC: What is your aim here?
###449 You don't want to lose your curves.
###452 FEMALE SPEAKER: People have a misconception
###452 about what health is.
###454 You know, just because you're a person of a certain size,
###457 they equate that to being unhealthy.
###459 But that's a misnomer.
###460 Because a person that's a smaller
###461 size could be unhealthy.
###463 But because of the way they look, you think
###465 that they're healthy.
###466 We got to help each other along the journey.
###469 FEMALE SPEAKER: So let's do it!
###470 FEMALE SPEAKER: Woo hoo!
###471 Walking Curves!
###472 [APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
###474 MALE SPEAKER: So what we're going to do
###475 is called the wobble.
###476 Have y'all heard of the wobble?
###477 [SCREAMING AND CHEERING]
###478 MALE SPEAKER: Oh, OK.
###480 The wobble.
###482 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###499 FEMALE SPEAKER: I just want to thank you all for coming to
###503 Walking Curves national debut.
###506 We might be a small group, baby, but we
###507 pack a mighty punch.
###509 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###511 CHARLOT DUBOC: Considering 78% of Americans don't meet the
###515 basic recommended activity level, it was encouraging to
###518 see that such an event was part of the
###520 fashion week schedule.
###522 But just a stone throw across town, nothing tastes as good
###526 as being thin feels.
###528 We headed to New York's high-end shopping district to
###531 try and get an idea of how size is perceived among the
###534 city's most discerning fashion consumers.
###537 Do you think stores like Chanel or any high-end
###540 boutique should be stocking above a size 12?
###544 FEMALE SPEAKER: I can't believe I'm saying this, but I
###546 don't think so.
###547 FEMALE SPEAKER: I think that people who are into high
###549 fashion are very conscious of the way they look.
###553 And part of the way they look dictates how much they weigh.
###557 FEMALE SPEAKER: I don't know.
###557 It's harder to make something fashionable
###558 if it's really large.
###560 FEMALE SPEAKER: There are enough secluded stores who
###564 only exclusively sell over size 14.
###569 FEMALE SPEAKER: It just depends on the person.
###570 If you see a size 22 woman, you know, slumping around in a
###573 big, you know, potato sack, she might not be attractive.
###575 But if you see her in a beautiful dress with lots of
###577 confidence, I think that's just as beautiful and fabulous
###580 as a skinny girl.
###581 CHARLOT DUBOC: If you went to bed tonight, woke up tomorrow,
###583 and you're a size 22, what would you do?
###586 FEMALE SPEAKER: Ooh.
###587 I think I'd go to the gym.
###589 FEMALE SPEAKER: I would probably go on an immediate
###591 diet because I would feel awful.
###593 I wouldn't leave my house until I lost 100 pounds.
###598 FEMALE SPEAKER: I would probably start balling.
###600 That sounds terrible.
###601 But I'm actually on my way to go shopping.
###603 And I do know that if I go shopping and I've just eaten,
###607 I don't feel as good when I'm trying on the clothes.
###609 Just because everyone gets, like, a little natural pooch
###611 after they eat.
###612 You know, it's totally natural.
###614 FEMALE SPEAKER: So I think they'd be wasting their time.
###616 I think they should do petite departments.
###619 That's where it's at for high fashion.
###622 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###624 CHARLOT DUBOC: Dispute the general feeling that plus
###626 sized fashion should be kept in the back of the high street
###628 department stores, there are numerous independent boutiques
###632 popping up around the city such as Redress, a plus sized
###635 vintage store in Brooklyn where I met Glen.
###638 Glen, where are we?
###640 What is this place?
###641 GLEN: Well, you're at Redress New York City.
###644 It's a vintage and resale clothing shop
###649 for plus size folks.
###652 The teggings are really popular.
###654 People come specifically for it.
###657 People will follow us on Facebook or Twitter, come in
###662 town from, like, North Carolina.
###664 And be like, where are the teggings?
###667 Because it's like a tight and legging hybrid.
###670 They're one size fits all, which we do not say lightly.
###673 We're not the kind of shop that's going to be like, one
###675 size fits all.
###676 Because that would make someone feel really crappy if
###679 we're like, one size fits all and it didn't fit me.
###681 I'd be, like, man, that's not right.
###683 That says one size fits all and it doesn't fit me.
###686 Your store sucks.
###687 But these--
###689 I don't know what this is made out of.
###690 It's some magic material.
###693 It's super comfortable.
###694 It doesn't dig into you.
###696 These little pins are $1 here.
###698 And people buy them.
###699 And they say things like, there's no wrong way to have a
###701 body, back fat is the new cleavage.
###706 My background is in queer, radical, sex positivity.
###713 And so that's my answer to how I learned to know that it's OK
###718 to have any kind of body and feel hot.
###722 But it's definitely a journey.
###724 You got to work a little bit to get the party.
###727 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###729 CHARLOT DUBOC: It seemed appropriate that the finale
###731 fashion show would be held in the outsized, overstimulating
###734 phenomenon that is Times Square.
###738 I got the feeling that what the event lacked in subtlety
###741 would be made up for in pure entertainment value.
###744 So we're going to go and see what's going on backstage
###747 because that's probably where all the action is.
###750 
###753 Hi.
###754 
###757 FEMALE SPEAKER: We're backstage at Full Figured
###759 Fashion Week and we're getting ready to go.
###761 I got my iPod so I can get my music going.
###764 And we're ready to hit the runway.
###765 We're ready to go.
###766 FEMALE SPEAKER: Yes.
###766 Yes.
###767 Yes.
###768 FEMALE SPEAKER: Could you do me a favor?
###769 You could do your hair back like that when you're walking
###771 down the runway.
###772 FEMALE SPEAKER: Sure.
###772 FEMALE SPEAKER: It takes a lot for a woman to be able to hold
###775 this and be confident with it.
###777 And I love it.
###778 I just love my curves.
###780 I love how they move.
###781 I wouldn't wish to be any other way.
###784 FEMALE SPEAKER: This group of people, all these designers,
###786 were shunned by Mercedes Benz Fashion Week.
###789 And they don't think we're real designers.
###791 And I think they don't think we're real women.
###793 And we are real women who are deserving of fashion.
###795 We are deserving of couture.
###798 And it's a mission of mine to keep pushing the envelope
###801 until we can get into one of those shows.
###803 Because we need to be represented.
###805 FEMALE SPEAKER: We're going to be doing
###806 pirouettes and turning.
###807 And doing all sorts of things.
###809 FEMALE SPEAKER: We have about eight minutes
###810 until the show starts.
###811 Everyone's going a little crazy.
###814 I'm sure that most of the models have
###816 butterflies just like I do.
###817 FEMALE SPEAKER: So, are you ready for fashion?
###820 [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
###821 FEMALE SPEAKER: I said, are you ready for fashion?
###823 [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
###833 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###860 [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
###868 CHARLOT DUBOC: I've never seen full figured women presented
###871 in this way or move in that way.
###873 FEMALE SPEAKER: It's ovehwhelming.
###874 What it is is that we're not used to seeing that.
###878 Like, women being so confident about their size and embracing
###882 it, and loving it, and out there with clothing that you
###884 would never think to see them in.
###886 It is emotional.
###887 CHARLOT DUBOC: It is, isn't it?
###889 FEMALE SPEAKER: And I cry at everything.
###892 I have to tell you my mom was a big woman.
###896 And her two favorite words was poly and ester.
###899 [CHEERING AND LAUGHTER]
###900 FEMALE SPEAKER: Y'all know about that.
###902 And to see the fashion today, it's ridiculous.
###906 I mean, one sleeved dresses, sequins, it's just so much
###911 beautiful fashion to choose from.
###913 And we're blessed to have it today.
###916 You guys looks beautiful.
###917 Please give a big hand and applause for yourselves for
###921 being here.
###922 FEMALE SPEAKER: They get excited when you're excited.
###924 I'm not excited.
###925 Why are you in my face?
###927 [LAUGHTER]
###928 FEMALE SPEAKER: Sergeant Runway, here.
###931 CHARLOT DUBOC: I'm no stranger to the bi-annual fashion week
###934 rip tour of the big four, London, New
###936 York, Paris, and Milan.
###938 There can be nothing so dull as watching cadaverous,
###941 androgynous-looking models walk past you in clothes and
###944 only just make it back up the runway alive.
###947 The atmosphere at Full Figured Fashion Week was brimming with
###949 a sense of triumph and unity--
###952 nothing short of life affirming.
###954 It was very much a case of the girls wearing the clothes
###957 rather than the clothes wearing them.
###959 As a result, I nearly forgot to look at the clothes, some
###963 of which were outlandish, others frankly quite ugly.
###966 But the girls rocked every last piece.
###968 
###971 What are you doing here tonight?
###972 MALE SPEAKER: I'm here to see beautiful full figured women.
###975 CHARLOT DUBOC: That's so great.
###976 So you're a fan of the fuller figured lady?
###979 MALE SPEAKER: I am.
###979 I am.
###980 Yes.
###980 It's all, like, shape and proportion really.
###982 And I like curves and voluptuous women, really.
###985 And I'm here to hopefully get some phone numbers and meet
###988 some new chicks.
###989 FEMALE SPEAKER: We're showing women that are classy.
###991 Woman that love their bodies.
###993 Women that are confident.
###994 And we're showing women that are fashionable.
###996 And they will strut their stuff.
###998 They show what they got to show and they have attitude.
###1000 And they respect themselves.
###1001 And absolutely, we need to showcase that in the US and
###1004 around the world.
###1005 Men need to understand that we are a whole lot of women
###1008 looking for a whole lot of man.
###1010 MALE SPEAKER: There were some that shouldn't have been in
###1012 high heels.
###1013 And there were some that I would have rather seen in just
###1016 high heels, just by their self, high heels
###1018 and birthday suits.
###1019 But, you know, 12 and up, light skin,
###1022 long hair, don't care.
###1023 That's how we getting it.
###1025 CHARLOT DUBOC: It's all finished.
###1026 And I have been honestly overwhelmed.
###1031 Because I've never seen women, full figured women, presented
###1035 in that way, celebrated in that way, moving in that way
###1039 to the extent that I feel like if I woke up tomorrow and I
###1043 was a size 16, 20, or 22, I'd be like, let's go.
###1049 And that is amazing.
###1051 And I just think if the rest of the world were affected
###1055 like I was, then things would improve.
###1059 And I just think everyone's got it wrong.
###1061 Everyone's had it so wrong for so long.
###1064 And, I mean, hell.
###1065 These women are hot.
###1067 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###1073 CHARLOT DUBOC: To top it all off, we were invited on a
###1076 celebratory cruise around Manhattan Island
###1078 called Curves at Sea.
###1081 FEMALE SPEAKER: Good evening.
###1082 [LAUGHTER]
###1085 FEMALE SPEAKER: OK.
###1085 Would you guys stop rocking in the boat, please.
###1088 Full Figured Fashion Week started sort of like a little
###1093 dream of mine.
###1094 I went to my first fashion event and I sat there.
###1097 And I said, something's not right about this.
###1100 There had to be other curvy girls in the world such as
###1104 myself who want to go to Fashion Week and be able to
###1107 see the fashions come alive via curvy models.
###1111 And they want to buy.
###1112 Because you want to know something?
###1114 We have an incredible amount of power through
###1119 our spending dollars.
###1120 What do you say?
###1122 [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
###1124 FEMALE SPEAKER: OK.
###1124 So I'm sitting there.
###1126 And I'm like, you know what?
###1127 I need to do something about this.
###1129 I am going to create my own full figured fashion week.
###1133 And guess what?
###1134 The rest is freaking history.
###1136 So put your hands together for Ms. Shonda Freeman.
###1139 [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
###1143 SHONDA: Thank you.
###1144 Thank you all so much.
###1145 I just wanted to say that for me, Gwen came to me at a time
###1151 in my life--
###1152 GLEN: Oh, Lord Jesus.
###1153 SHONDA: I'm sorry.
###1154 
###1157 I just lost my mom.
###1159 
###1163 And [INAUDIBLE]
###1165 understand, it's not about fashion.
###1170 It is about respect, inspiration, and all of us
###1176 empowering each other.
###1179 I feel like Full Figured Fashion Week is a sisterhood.
###1185 And just God bless all of you.
###1187 FEMALE SPEAKER: Yes, he is.
###1187 SHONDA: And keep you safe.
###1188 And always a lady first.
###1191 Thank you.
###1192 [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
###1194 FEMALE SPEAKER: Repeat after me.
###1195 Size!
###1195 ALL: Size!
###1196 FEMALE SPEAKER: Doesn't bury our!
###1197 ALL: Doesn't bury our!
###1199 FEMALE SPEAKER: Our beauty!
###1200 [APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
###1200 ALL: Our beauty!
###1201 FEMALE SPEAKER: Oh, my God.
###1202 Give yourselves a thundering, thunder,
###1203 thunderous round of applause.
###1205 [APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
###1206 FEMALE SPEAKER: Love and kisses to you all.
###1208 Enjoy yourself.
###1209 And have a blessed, blessed Full Figured Fashion Week.
###1212 [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
###1215 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###1231 CHARLOT DUBOC: As Shonda said, Full Figured Fashion Week was
###1234 about much more than just fashion.
###1237 I've been welcomed into the bosom of what felt more like a
###1239 sisterhood than a fashion crowd.
###1241 First, no one's denying that it's everybody's right to feel
###1244 and look good, the question of size and health remains a
###1247 massively divisive topic in western society.
###1251 But at that moment, on that boat, at one of the best
###1254 fashion parties I've ever been to, I felt pretty convinced
###1257 that bigger is definitely better.
###1259 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###1268 FEMALE SPEAKER: A big cake for a big girl.
###1271 Fab, full figured is in.
###1273 [MUSIC PLAYING]
