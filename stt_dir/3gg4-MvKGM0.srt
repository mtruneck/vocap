0:0:7,61 --> 0:0:9,525
Hey, I'm Hanson O'Haver.


3
0:0:9,525 --> 0:0:14,78
So Drake premiered two videos
this week, one for "HYFR," one


4
0:0:14,78 --> 0:0:17,49
for "Take Care." I think that
we should talk about "Take


5
0:0:17,49 --> 0:0:19,23
Care" first, just because
it's the least


6
0:0:19,23 --> 0:0:21,37
interesting of the two.


7
0:0:21,37 --> 0:0:24,99
The video is directed by the
guy who directed the video


8
0:0:24,99 --> 0:0:27,23
where Lana Del Rey dies
in a car crash.


9
0:0:27,23 --> 0:0:32,179
But for this one, in lieu of a
shirtless face-tatted alt-bro,


10
0:0:32,179 --> 0:0:34,69
there's Rihanna.


11
0:0:34,69 --> 0:0:37,15
Both videos feature
wild animals.


12
0:0:37,15 --> 0:0:40,82
I think in Drake's there's some
sort of eagle, and then


13
0:0:40,82 --> 0:0:43,3
what looks like a
water buffalo.


14
0:0:43,3 --> 0:0:46,64
So the video is mostly Rihanna
and Drake hugging with kind of


15
0:0:46,64 --> 0:0:48,58
like an anguished look
on their face.


16
0:0:48,58 --> 0:0:51,45
There's also some slow-mo
nature shots.


17
0:0:51,45 --> 0:0:54,2
But for the most part, it's
all just in a gray room.


18
0:0:54,2 --> 0:0:57,0
The director described the video
as humble, but I think


19
0:0:57,0 --> 0:0:58,73
really it's just generic.


20
0:0:58,73 --> 0:1:2,66
It's sort of like when you go to
an art gallery, between the


21
0:1:2,66 --> 0:1:5,23
really great pieces, the master
works, there's just


22
0:1:5,23 --> 0:1:7,55
kind of filler stuff,
so there's enough


23
0:1:7,55 --> 0:1:9,57
to make an art show.


24
0:1:9,57 --> 0:1:14,54
It's a really instead of being a
meaningful rap video, it's a


25
0:1:14,54 --> 0:1:16,64
simulacrum of a meaningful
rap video.


26
0:1:16,64 --> 0:1:21,29
So the "HYFR" video, it starts
with footage from Drake's


27
0:1:21,29 --> 0:1:24,69
actual bar mitzvah with the
13-year-old Drake dancing.


28
0:1:24,69 --> 0:1:27,4
And it's [BLEEP]ing adorable.


29
0:1:27,4 --> 0:1:30,17
And then the rest of the videos
claims to be real


30
0:1:30,17 --> 0:1:32,53
footage of Drake's
re-bar mitzvah.


31
0:1:32,53 --> 0:1:35,7
It basically shows Drake and
his crew with some really


32
0:1:35,7 --> 0:1:39,86
pretty girls and some dorky
old white men wowzing out.


33
0:1:39,86 --> 0:1:42,86
At one point, Drake gets
hoisted on a chair.


34
0:1:42,86 --> 0:1:44,47
A cake get smashed.


35
0:1:44,47 --> 0:1:47,95
Also, Lil Wayne has a panda mask
and a skateboard, kind of


36
0:1:47,95 --> 0:1:52,47
solidifying his ascension into
cautionary tale status.


37
0:1:52,47 --> 0:1:54,2
The video is funny.


38
0:1:54,2 --> 0:1:55,21
It's exciting.


39
0:1:55,21 --> 0:1:56,88
It's easily made into GIFs.


40
0:1:56,88 --> 0:2:0,36
It's really everything that a
rap video should be in 2012.


41
0:2:0,36 --> 0:2:3,15
I don't think the video's going
to do much to help solve


42
0:2:3,15 --> 0:2:5,26
the Israel-Palestine conflict.


43
0:2:5,26 --> 0:2:7,83
I don't think that BBNet and
Yahoo and the members of Fatah


44
0:2:7,83 --> 0:2:11,3
are going to watch it, but
it could only help.


45
0:2:11,3 --> 0:2:17,6

0:2:17,6 --> 0:4:17,6
