1
0:0:0,179 --> 0:0:32,9
Gentlemen, thank you both for joining us here
tonight. We have a lot of folks who’ve been


2
0:0:32,9 --> 0:0:35,91
waiting all day to talk to you, so I want
to get right to it.


3
0:0:35,91 --> 0:0:39,829
Governor Romney, as you know, you won the
coin toss, so the first question will go to


4
0:0:39,829 --> 0:0:45,91
you. And I want to turn to a first-time voter,
Jeremy Epstein, who has a question for you.


5
0:0:45,91 --> 0:0:50,87
QUESTION: Mr. President, Governor Romney,
as a 20-year-old college student, all I hear


6
0:0:50,87 --> 0:0:57,469
from professors, neighbors and others is that
when I graduate, I will have little chance


7
0:0:57,469 --> 0:1:2,35
to get employment. What can you say to reassure
me, but more importantly my parents, that


8
0:1:2,35 --> 0:1:5,95
I will be able to sufficiently support myself
after I graduate?


9
0:1:5,95 --> 0:1:9,71
ROMNEY: Thank you, Jeremy. I appreciate your
— your question, and thank you for being


10
0:1:9,71 --> 0:1:13,25
here this evening and to all of those from
Nassau County that have come, thank you for


11
0:1:13,25 --> 0:1:18,49
your time. Thank you to Hofstra University
and to Candy Crowley for organizing and leading


12
0:1:18,49 --> 0:1:21,76
this — this event.
Thank you, Mr. President, also for being part


13
0:1:21,76 --> 0:1:25,5
of this — this debate.
Your question — your question is one that’s


14
0:1:25,5 --> 0:1:29,5
being asked by college kids all over this
country. I was in Pennsylvania with someone


15
0:1:29,5 --> 0:1:34,84
who had just graduated — this was in Philadelphia
— and she said, “I’ve got my degree.


16
0:1:34,84 --> 0:1:38,89
I can’t find a job. I’ve got three part-
time jobs. They’re just barely enough to


17
0:1:38,89 --> 0:1:43,43
pay for my food and pay for an apartment.
I can’t begin to pay back my student loans.”


18
0:1:43,43 --> 0:1:46,63
So what we have to do is two things. We have
to make sure that we make it easier for kids


19
0:1:46,63 --> 0:1:49,9
to afford college.
ROMNEY: And also make sure that when they


20
0:1:49,9 --> 0:1:53,61
get out of college, there’s a job. When
I was governor of Massachusetts, to get a


21
0:1:53,61 --> 0:1:58,52
high school degree, you had to pass an exam.
If you graduated in the top quarter of your


22
0:1:58,52 --> 0:2:3,869
airlines, we gave you a John and Abigail Adams
scholarship, four years tuition free in the


23
0:2:3,869 --> 0:2:7,619
college of your choice in Massachusetts, it’s
a public institution.


24
0:2:7,619 --> 0:2:11,999
I want to make sure we keep our Pell grant
program growing. We’re also going to have


25
0:2:11,999 --> 0:2:16,309
our loan program, so that people are able
to afford school. But the key thing is to


26
0:2:16,309 --> 0:2:19,65
make sure you can get a job when you get out
of school. And what’s happened over the


27
0:2:19,65 --> 0:2:24,239
last four years has been very, very hard for
America’s young people. I want you to be


28
0:2:24,239 --> 0:2:28,19
able to get a job.
I know what it takes to get this economy going.


29
0:2:28,19 --> 0:2:33,809
With half of college kids graduating this
year without a college — excuse me, without


30
0:2:33,809 --> 0:2:37,319
a job. And without a college level job, that’s
just unacceptable.


31
0:2:37,319 --> 0:2:41,519
And likewise you’ve got more and more debt
on your back. So more debt and less jobs.


32
0:2:41,519 --> 0:2:46,49
I’m going to change that. I know what it
takes to create good jobs again. I know what


33
0:2:46,49 --> 0:2:50,43
it takes to make sure that you have the kind
of opportunity you deserve. And kids across


34
0:2:50,43 --> 0:2:53,419
this country are going to recognize, we’re
bringing back an economy.


35
0:2:53,419 --> 0:2:57,379
It’s not going to be like the last four
years. The middle-class has been crushed over


36
0:2:57,379 --> 0:3:1,749
the last four years, and jobs have been too
scarce. I know what it takes to bring them


37
0:3:1,749 --> 0:3:6,169
back, and I’m going to do that, and make
sure that when you graduate — when do you


38
0:3:6,169 --> 0:3:6,689
graduate?
QUESTION: 2014.


39
0:3:6,689 --> 0:3:9,68
ROMNEY: 2014. When you come out in 2014, I
presume I’m going to be president. I’m


40
0:3:9,68 --> 0:3:12,889
going to make sure you get a job. Thanks Jeremy.
Yeah, you bet.


41
0:3:12,889 --> 0:3:17,559
CROWLEY: Mr. President?
OBAMA: Jeremy, first of all, your future is


42
0:3:17,559 --> 0:3:22,93
bright. And the fact that you’re making
an investment in higher education is critical.


43
0:3:22,93 --> 0:3:28,18
Not just to you, but to the entire nation.
Now, the most important thing we can do is


44
0:3:28,18 --> 0:3:33,79
to make sure that we are creating jobs in
this country. But not just jobs, good paying


45
0:3:33,79 --> 0:3:37,969
jobs. Ones that can support a family.
OBAMA: And what I want to do, is build on


46
0:3:37,969 --> 0:3:41,93
the five million jobs that we’ve created
over the last 30 months in the private sector


47
0:3:41,93 --> 0:3:46,889
alone. And there are a bunch of things we
can do to make sure your future is bright.


48
0:3:46,889 --> 0:3:54,299
Number one, I want to build manufacturing
jobs in this country again. Now when Governor


49
0:3:54,299 --> 0:3:59,219
Romney said we should let Detroit go bankrupt.
I said we’re going to bet on American workers


50
0:3:59,219 --> 0:4:2,559
and the American auto industry and it’s
come surging back.


51
0:4:2,559 --> 0:4:6,949
I want to do that in industries, not just
in Detroit, but all across the country and


52
0:4:6,949 --> 0:4:10,9
that means we change our tax code so we’re
giving incentives to companies that are investing


53
0:4:10,9 --> 0:4:13,51
here in the United States and creating jobs
here.


54
0:4:13,51 --> 0:4:18,229
It also means we’re helping them and small
businesses to export all around the world


55
0:4:18,229 --> 0:4:22,49
to new markets.
Number two, we’ve got to make sure that


56
0:4:22,49 --> 0:4:26,569
we have the best education system in the world.
And the fact that you’re going to college


57
0:4:26,569 --> 0:4:30,819
is great, but I want everybody to get a great
education and we’ve worked hard to make


58
0:4:30,819 --> 0:4:35,4
sure that student loans are available for
folks like you, but I also want to make sure


59
0:4:35,4 --> 0:4:39,59
that community colleges are offering slots
for workers to get retrained for the jobs


60
0:4:39,59 --> 0:4:42,24
that are out there right now and the jobs
of the future.


61
0:4:42,24 --> 0:4:48,93
Number three, we’ve got to control our own
energy. Now, not only oil and natural gas,


62
0:4:48,93 --> 0:4:52,47
which we’ve been investing in; but also,
we’ve got to make sure we’re building


63
0:4:52,47 --> 0:4:56,9
the energy source of the future, not just
thinking about next year, but ten years from


64
0:4:56,9 --> 0:5:1,289
now, 20 years from now. That’s why we’ve
invested in solar and wind and biofuels, energy


65
0:5:1,289 --> 0:5:4,2
efficient cars.
We’ve got to reduce our deficit, but we’ve


66
0:5:4,2 --> 0:5:7,699
got to do it in a balanced way. Asking the
wealthy to pay a little bit more along with


67
0:5:7,699 --> 0:5:10,539
cuts so that we can invest in education like
yours.


68
0:5:10,539 --> 0:5:15,61
And let’s take the money that we’ve been
spending on war over the last decade to rebuild


69
0:5:15,61 --> 0:5:20,28
America, roads, bridges schools. We do those
things, not only is your future going to be


70
0:5:20,28 --> 0:5:23,2
bright but America’s future is going to
bright as well.


71
0:5:23,2 --> 0:5:29,24
CROWLEY: Let me ask you for more immediate
answer and begin with Mr. Romney just quickly


72
0:5:29,24 --> 0:5:35,229
what — what can you do? We’re looking
at a situation where 40 percent of the unemployed


73
0:5:35,229 --> 0:5:38,169
have been unemployed have been unemployed
for six months or more. They don’t have


74
0:5:38,169 --> 0:5:43,669
the two years that Jeremy has.
What about those long term unemployed who


75
0:5:43,669 --> 0:5:46,28
need a job right now?
ROMNEY: Well what you’re seeing in this


76
0:5:46,28 --> 0:5:51,3
country is 23 million people struggling to
find a job. And a lot of them, as you say,


77
0:5:51,3 --> 0:5:55,59
Candy, have been out of work for a long, long,
long time. The president’s policies have


78
0:5:55,59 --> 0:6:0,639
been exercised over the last four years and
they haven’t put Americans back to work.


79
0:6:0,639 --> 0:6:5,24
We have fewer people working today than we
had when the president took office. If the


80
0:6:5,24 --> 0:6:10,629
— the unemployment rate was 7.8 percent
when he took office, it’s 7.8 percent now.


81
0:6:10,629 --> 0:6:14,34
But if you calculated that unemployment rate,
taking back the people who dropped out of


82
0:6:14,34 --> 0:6:19,18
the workforce, it would be 10.7 percent.
We have not made the progress we need to make


83
0:6:19,18 --> 0:6:23,689
to put people back to work. That’s why I
put out a five-point plan that gets America


84
0:6:23,689 --> 0:6:29,59
12 million new jobs in four years and rising
take-home pay. It’s going to help Jeremy


85
0:6:29,59 --> 0:6:33,12
get a job when he comes out of school. It’s
going to help people across the country that


86
0:6:33,12 --> 0:6:36,599
are unemployed right now.
And one thing that the president said, which


87
0:6:36,599 --> 0:6:42,31
I want to make sure that we understand, he
said that I said we should take Detroit bankrupt.


88
0:6:42,31 --> 0:6:46,37
And that’s right. My plan was to have the
company go through bankruptcy like 7-Eleven


89
0:6:46,37 --> 0:6:51,86
did and Macy’s and Condell (ph) Airlines
and come out stronger.


90
0:6:51,86 --> 0:6:55,58
And I know he keeps saying, you want to take
Detroit bankrupt. Well, the president took


91
0:6:55,58 --> 0:7:0,68
Detroit bankrupt. You took General Motors
bankrupt. You took Chrysler bankrupt. So when


92
0:7:0,68 --> 0:7:5,93
you say that I wanted to take the auto industry
bankrupt, you actually did.


93
0:7:5,93 --> 0:7:9,62
And I think it’s important to know that
that was a process that was necessary to get


94
0:7:9,62 --> 0:7:14,819
those companies back on their feet, so they
could start hiring more people. That was precisely


95
0:7:14,819 --> 0:7:18,779
what I recommended and ultimately what happened.
CROWLEY: Let me give the president a chance.


96
0:7:18,779 --> 0:7:24,729
Go ahead. OBAMA: Candy, what Governor Romney
said just isn’t true. He wanted to take


97
0:7:24,729 --> 0:7:30,65
them into bankruptcy without providing them
any way to stay open. And we would have lost


98
0:7:30,65 --> 0:7:39,249
a million jobs. And that — don’t take
my word for it, take the executives at GM


99
0:7:39,249 --> 0:7:43,389
and Chrysler, some of whom are Republicans,
may even support Governor Romney. But they’ll


100
0:7:43,389 --> 0:7:45,719
tell you his prescription wasn’t going to
work.


101
0:7:45,719 --> 0:7:49,379
And Governor Romney’s says he’s got a
five-point plan? Governor Romney doesn’t


102
0:7:49,379 --> 0:7:54,86
have a five-point plan. He has a one-point
plan. And that plan is to make sure that folks


103
0:7:54,86 --> 0:8:3,499
at the top play by a different set of rules.
That’s been his philosophy in the private


104
0:8:3,499 --> 0:8:7,52
sector, that’s been his philosophy as governor,
that’s been his philosophy as a presidential


105
0:8:7,52 --> 0:8:14,4
candidate.
You can make a lot of money and pay lower


106
0:8:14,4 --> 0:8:20,69
tax rates than somebody who makes a lot less.
You can ship jobs overseas and get tax breaks


107
0:8:20,69 --> 0:8:21,58
for it. You can invest in a company, bankrupt
it, lay off the workers, strip away their


108
0:8:21,58 --> 0:8:21,58
pensions, and you still make money.
That’s exactly the philosophy that we’ve


109
0:8:21,58 --> 0:8:27,4
seen in place for the last decade. That’s
what’s been squeezing middle class families.


110
0:8:27,4 --> 0:8:32,37
And we have fought back for four years to
get out of that mess. The last thing we need


111
0:8:32,37 --> 0:8:36,419
to do is to go back to the very same policies
that got us there.


112
0:8:36,419 --> 0:8:39,68
CROWLEY: Mr. President, the next question
is going to be for you here.


113
0:8:39,68 --> 0:8:42,82
And, Mr. Romney — Governor Romney — there’ll
be plenty of chances here to go on, but I


114
0:8:42,82 --> 0:8:43,61
want to…
ROMNEY: That — that Detroit — that Detroit


115
0:8:43,61 --> 0:8:44,519
answer…
CROWLEY: We have all these folks.


116
0:8:44,519 --> 0:8:46,25
ROMNEY: … that Detroit answer…
CROWLEY: I will let you absolutely…


117
0:8:46,25 --> 0:8:48,29
ROMNEY: … and the rest of the answer, way
off the mark.


118
0:8:48,29 --> 0:8:52,25
CROWLEY: OK. Will — will — you certainly
will have lots of time here coming up.


119
0:8:52,25 --> 0:8:56,259
Because I want to move you on to something
that’s sort of connected to cars here, and


120
0:8:56,259 --> 0:9:2,949
— and go over. And we want to get a question
from Phillip Tricolla.


121
0:9:2,949 --> 0:9:11,459
QUESTION: Your energy secretary, Steven Chu,
has now been on record three times stating


122
0:9:11,459 --> 0:9:17,79
it’s not policy of his department to help
lower gas prices. Do you agree with Secretary


123
0:9:17,79 --> 0:9:21,17
Chu that this is not the job of the Energy
Department?


124
0:9:21,17 --> 0:9:28,48
OBAMA: The most important thing we can do
is to make sure we control our own energy.


125
0:9:28,48 --> 0:9:33,91
So here’s what I’ve done since I’ve
been president. We have increased oil production


126
0:9:33,91 --> 0:9:38,339
to the highest levels in 16 years.
Natural gas production is the highest it’s


127
0:9:38,339 --> 0:9:47,12
been in decades. We have seen increases in
coal production and coal employment. But what


128
0:9:47,12 --> 0:9:52,19
I’ve also said is we can’t just produce
traditional source of energy. We’ve also


129
0:9:52,19 --> 0:9:56,42
got to look to the future. That’s why we
doubled fuel efficiency standards on cars.


130
0:9:56,42 --> 0:10:0,68
That means that in the middle of the next
decade, any car you buy, you’re going to


131
0:10:0,68 --> 0:10:5,649
end up going twice as far on a gallon of gas.
That’s why we doubled clean — clean energy


132
0:10:5,649 --> 0:10:10,99
production like wind and solar and biofuels.
And all these things have contributed to us


133
0:10:10,99 --> 0:10:17,87
lowering our oil imports to the lowest levels
in 16 years. Now, I want to build on that.


134
0:10:17,87 --> 0:10:23,19
And that means, yes, we still continue to
open up new areas for drilling. We continue


135
0:10:23,19 --> 0:10:29,85
to make it a priority for us to go after natural
gas. We’ve got potentially 600,000 jobs


136
0:10:29,85 --> 0:10:34,3
and 100 years worth of energy right beneath
our feet with natural gas.


137
0:10:34,3 --> 0:10:39,5
And we can do it in an environmentally sound
way. But we’ve also got to continue to figure


138
0:10:39,5 --> 0:10:44,19
out how we have efficiency energy, because
ultimately that’s how we’re going to reduce


139
0:10:44,19 --> 0:10:48,48
demand and that’s what’s going to keep
gas prices lower.


140
0:10:48,48 --> 0:10:53,88
Now, Governor Romney will say he’s got an
all-of-the-above plan, but basically his plan


141
0:10:53,88 --> 0:11:2,209
is to let the oil companies write the energy
policies. So he’s got the oil and gas part,


142
0:11:2,209 --> 0:11:8,579
but he doesn’t have the clean energy part.
And if we are only thinking about tomorrow


143
0:11:8,579 --> 0:11:13,3
or the next day and not thinking about 10
years from now, we’re not going to control


144
0:11:13,3 --> 0:11:19,649
our own economic future. Because China, Germany,
they’re making these investments. And I’m


145
0:11:19,649 --> 0:11:24,49
not going to cede those jobs of the future
to those countries. I expect those new energy


146
0:11:24,49 --> 0:11:26,6
sources to be built right here in the United
States.


147
0:11:26,6 --> 0:11:30,35
That’s going to help Jeremy get a job. It’s
also going to make sure that you’re not


148
0:11:30,35 --> 0:11:34,36
paying as much for gas.
CROWLEY: Governor, on the subject of gas prices?


149
0:11:34,36 --> 0:11:39,13
ROMNEY: Well, let’s look at the president’s
policies, all right, as opposed to the rhetoric,


150
0:11:39,13 --> 0:11:43,91
because we’ve had four years of policies
being played out. And the president’s right


151
0:11:43,91 --> 0:11:48,94
in terms of the additional oil production,
but none of it came on federal land. As a


152
0:11:48,94 --> 0:11:53,48
matter of fact, oil production is down 14
percent this year on federal land, and gas


153
0:11:53,48 --> 0:11:58,85
production was down 9 percent. Why? Because
the president cut in half the number of licenses


154
0:11:58,85 --> 0:12:3,35
and permits for drilling on federal lands,
and in federal waters.


155
0:12:3,35 --> 0:12:6,709
So where’d the increase come from? Well
a lot of it came from the Bakken Range in


156
0:12:6,709 --> 0:12:12,73
North Dakota. What was his participation there?
The administration brought a criminal action


157
0:12:12,73 --> 0:12:17,75
against the people drilling up there for oil,
this massive new resource we have. And what


158
0:12:17,75 --> 0:12:23,319
was the cost? 20 or 25 birds were killed and
brought out a migratory bird act to go after


159
0:12:23,319 --> 0:12:27,3
them on a criminal basis.
Look, I want to make sure we use our oil,


160
0:12:27,3 --> 0:12:34,5
our coal, our gas, our nuclear, our renewables.
I believe very much in our renewable capabilities;


161
0:12:34,5 --> 0:12:38,62
ethanol, wind, solar will be an important
part of our energy mix.


162
0:12:38,62 --> 0:12:43,75
But what we don’t need is to have the president
keeping us from taking advantage of oil, coal


163
0:12:43,75 --> 0:12:49,41
and gas. This has not been Mr. Oil, or Mr.
Gas, or Mr. Coal. Talk to the people that


164
0:12:49,41 --> 0:12:54,529
are working in those industries. I was in
coal country. People grabbed my arms and said,


165
0:12:54,529 --> 0:12:59,18
“Please save my job.” The head of the
EPA said, “You can’t build a coal plant.


166
0:12:59,18 --> 0:13:3,5
You’ll virtually — it’s virtually impossible
given our regulations.” When the president


167
0:13:3,5 --> 0:13:8,339
ran for office, he said if you build a coal
plant, you can go ahead, but you’ll go bankrupt.


168
0:13:8,339 --> 0:13:12,41
That’s not the right course for America.
Let’s take advantage of the energy resources


169
0:13:12,41 --> 0:13:17,86
we have, as well as the energy sources for
the future. And if we do that, if we do what


170
0:13:17,86 --> 0:13:23,8
I’m planning on doing, which is getting
us energy independent, North America energy


171
0:13:23,8 --> 0:13:29,69
independence within eight years, you’re
going to see manufacturing jobs come back.


172
0:13:29,69 --> 0:13:33,839
Because our energy is low cost, that are already
beginning to come back because of our abundant


173
0:13:33,839 --> 0:13:39,6
energy. I’ll get America and North America
energy independent. I’ll do it by more drilling,


174
0:13:39,6 --> 0:13:43,79
more permits and licenses.
We’re going to bring that pipeline in from


175
0:13:43,79 --> 0:13:47,49
Canada. How in the world the president said
no to that pipeline? I will never know.


176
0:13:47,49 --> 0:13:51,68
This is about bringing good jobs back for
the middle class of America, and that’s


177
0:13:51,68 --> 0:13:55,66
what I’m going to do. CROWLEY: Mr. President,
let me just see if I can move you to the gist


178
0:13:55,66 --> 0:14:0,29
of this question, which is, are we looking
at the new normal? I can tell you that tomorrow


179
0:14:0,29 --> 0:14:2,8
morning, a lot of people in Hempstead will
wake up and fill up and they will find that


180
0:14:2,8 --> 0:14:8,97
the price of gas is over $4 a gallon.
Is it within the purview of the government


181
0:14:8,97 --> 0:14:12,18
to bring those prices down, or are we looking
at the new normal?


182
0:14:12,18 --> 0:14:16,699
OBAMA: Candy, there’s no doubt that world
demand’s gone up, but our production is


183
0:14:16,699 --> 0:14:22,569
going up, and we’re using oil more efficiently.
And very little of what Governor Romney just


184
0:14:22,569 --> 0:14:29,25
said is true. We’ve opened up public lands.
We’re actually drilling more on public lands


185
0:14:29,25 --> 0:14:34,519
than in the previous administration and my
— the previous president was an oil man.


186
0:14:34,519 --> 0:14:40,79
And natural gas isn’t just appearing magically.
We’re encouraging it and working with the


187
0:14:40,79 --> 0:14:44,86
industry.
And when I hear Governor Romney say he’s


188
0:14:44,86 --> 0:14:48,529
a big coal guy, I mean, keep in mind, when
— Governor, when you were governor of Massachusetts,


189
0:14:48,529 --> 0:14:55,199
you stood in front of a coal plant and pointed
at it and said, “This plant kills,” and


190
0:14:55,199 --> 0:15:1,199
took great pride in shutting it down. And
now suddenly you’re a big champion of coal.


191
0:15:1,199 --> 0:15:6,6
So what I’ve tried to do is be consistent.
With respect to something like coal, we made


192
0:15:6,6 --> 0:15:11,74
the largest investment in clean coal technology,
to make sure that even as we’re producing


193
0:15:11,74 --> 0:15:16,569
more coal, we’re producing it cleaner and
smarter. Same thing with oil, same thing with


194
0:15:16,569 --> 0:15:20,3
natural gas.
And the proof is our oil imports are down


195
0:15:20,3 --> 0:15:27,67
to the lowest levels in 20 years. Oil production
is up, natural gas production is up, and,


196
0:15:27,67 --> 0:15:32,79
most importantly, we’re also starting to
build cars that are more efficient.


197
0:15:32,79 --> 0:15:35,569
And that’s creating jobs. That means those
cars can be exported, ‘cause that’s the


198
0:15:35,569 --> 0:15:39,68
demand around the world, and it also means
that it’ll save money in your pocketbook.


199
0:15:39,68 --> 0:15:42,85
OBAMA: That’s the strategy you need, an
all-of-the-above strategy, and that’s what


200
0:15:42,85 --> 0:15:46,99
we’re going to do in the next four years.
ROMNEY: But that’s not what you’ve done


201
0:15:46,99 --> 0:15:52,35
in the last four years. That’s the problem.
In the last four years, you cut permits and


202
0:15:52,35 --> 0:15:54,97
licenses on federal land and federal waters
in half.


203
0:15:54,97 --> 0:15:57,22
OBAMA: Not true, Governor Romney.
ROMNEY: So how much did you cut (inaudible)?


204
0:15:57,22 --> 0:15:59,79
OBAMA: Not true.
ROMNEY: How much did you cut them by, then?


205
0:15:59,79 --> 0:16:0,98
OBAMA: Governor, we have actually produced
more oil –


206
0:16:0,98 --> 0:16:4,43
ROMNEY: No, no. How much did you cut licenses
and permits on federal land and federal waters?


207
0:16:4,43 --> 0:16:8,89
OBAMA: Governor Romney, here’s what we did.
There were a whole bunch of oil companies.


208
0:16:8,89 --> 0:16:10,29
(CROSSTALK)
ROMNEY: No, no, I had a question and the question


209
0:16:10,29 --> 0:16:12,12
was how much did you cut them by?
OBAMA: You want me to answer a question –


210
0:16:12,12 --> 0:16:14,3
ROMNEY: How much did you cut them by?
OBAMA: I’m happy to answer the question.


211
0:16:14,3 --> 0:16:17,639
ROMNEY: All right. And it is –
OBAMA: Here’s what happened. You had a whole


212
0:16:17,639 --> 0:16:23,92
bunch of oil companies who had leases on public
lands that they weren’t using. So what we


213
0:16:23,92 --> 0:16:29,8
said was you can’t just sit on this for
10, 20, 30 years, decide when you want to


214
0:16:29,8 --> 0:16:34,569
drill, when you want to produce, when it’s
most profitable for you. These are public


215
0:16:34,569 --> 0:16:40,189
lands. So if you want to drill on public lands,
you use it or you lose it.


216
0:16:40,189 --> 0:16:42,819
ROMNEY: OK, (inaudible) –
OBAMA: And so what we did was take away those


217
0:16:42,819 --> 0:16:46,35
leases. And we are now reletting them so that
we can actually make a profit.


218
0:16:46,35 --> 0:16:48,37
ROMNEY: And production on private — on government
land –


219
0:16:48,37 --> 0:16:49,37
OBAMA: Production is up.
ROMNEY: — is down.


220
0:16:49,37 --> 0:16:51,19
OBAMA: No, it isn’t.
ROMNEY: Production on government land of oil


221
0:16:51,19 --> 0:16:52,35
is down 14 percent.
OBAMA: Governor –


222
0:16:52,35 --> 0:16:53,81
ROMNEY: And production on gas –
(CROSSTALK)


223
0:16:53,81 --> 0:16:57,73
OBAMA: It’s just not true.
ROMNEY: It’s absolutely true. Look, there’s


224
0:16:57,73 --> 0:17:2,8
no question but the people recognize that
we have not produced more (inaudible) on federal


225
0:17:2,8 --> 0:17:7,91
lands and in federal waters. And coal, coal
production is not up; coal jobs are not up.


226
0:17:7,91 --> 0:17:12,83
I was just at a coal facility, where some
1,200 people lost their jobs. The right course


227
0:17:12,83 --> 0:17:18,37
for America is to have a true all-of-the-above
policy. I don’t think anyone really believes


228
0:17:18,37 --> 0:17:22,24
that you’re a person who’s going to be
pushing for oil and gas and coal. You’ll


229
0:17:22,24 --> 0:17:24,43
get your chance in a moment. I’m still speaking.
OBAMA: Well –


230
0:17:24,43 --> 0:17:26,71
ROMNEY: And the answer is I don’t believe
people think that’s the case –


231
0:17:26,71 --> 0:17:28,6
OBAMA: — (inaudible).
ROMNEY: That wasn’t the question.


232
0:17:28,6 --> 0:17:30,16
OBAMA: OK.
ROMNEY: That was a statement. I don’t think


233
0:17:30,16 --> 0:17:35,38
the American people believe that. I will fight
for oil, coal and natural gas. And the proof,


234
0:17:35,38 --> 0:17:39,2
the proof of whether a strategy is working
or not is what the price is that you’re


235
0:17:39,2 --> 0:17:44,92
paying at the pump. If you’re paying less
than you paid a year or two ago, why, then,


236
0:17:44,92 --> 0:17:48,56
the strategy is working. But you’re paying
more. When the president took office, the


237
0:17:48,56 --> 0:17:51,28
price of gasoline here in Nassau County was
about $1.86 a gallon. Now, it’s $4.00 a


238
0:17:51,28 --> 0:17:58,9
gallon. The price of electricity is up.
If the president’s energy policies are working,


239
0:17:58,9 --> 0:18:3,11
you’re going to see the cost of energy come
down. I will fight to create more energy in


240
0:18:3,11 --> 0:18:8,51
this country, to get America energy secure.
And part of that is bringing in a pipeline


241
0:18:8,51 --> 0:18:13,76
of oil from Canada, taking advantage of the
oil and coal we have here, drilling offshore


242
0:18:13,76 --> 0:18:18,0
in Alaska, drilling offshore in Virginia where
the people want it. Those things will get


243
0:18:18,0 --> 0:18:20,89
us the energy we need.
CROWLEY: Mr. President, could you address,


244
0:18:20,89 --> 0:18:26,98
because we did finally get to gas prices here,
could you address what the governor said,


245
0:18:26,98 --> 0:18:32,83
which is if your energy policy was working,
the price of gasoline would not be $4 a gallon


246
0:18:32,83 --> 0:18:33,99
here. Is that true?
OBAMA: Well, think about what the governor


247
0:18:33,99 --> 0:18:37,3
— think about what the governor just said.
He said when I took office, the price of gasoline


248
0:18:37,3 --> 0:18:45,12
was $1.80, $1.86. Why is that? Because the
economy was on the verge of collapse, because


249
0:18:45,12 --> 0:18:50,9
we were about to go through the worst recession
since the Great Depression, as a consequence


250
0:18:50,9 --> 0:18:54,16
of some of the same policies that Governor
Romney’s now promoting.


251
0:18:54,16 --> 0:18:58,29
So, it’s conceivable that Governor Romney
could bring down gas prices because with his


252
0:18:58,29 --> 0:19:5,93
policies, we might be back in that same mess.
What I want to do is to create an economy


253
0:19:5,93 --> 0:19:11,89
that is strong, and at the same time produce
energy. And with respect to this pipeline


254
0:19:11,89 --> 0:19:16,45
that Governor Romney keeps on talking about,
we’ve — we’ve built enough pipeline


255
0:19:16,45 --> 0:19:23,8
to wrap around the entire earth once.
So, I’m all for pipelines. I’m all for


256
0:19:23,8 --> 0:19:28,62
oil production. What I’m not for is us ignoring
the other half of the equation. So, for example,


257
0:19:28,62 --> 0:19:33,41
on wind energy, when Governor Romney says
“these are imaginary jobs.” When you’ve


258
0:19:33,41 --> 0:19:40,31
got thousands of people right now in Iowa,
right now in Colorado, who are working, creating


259
0:19:40,31 --> 0:19:46,48
wind power with good-paying manufacturing
jobs, and the Republican senator in that — in


260
0:19:46,48 --> 0:19:53,12
Iowa is all for it, providing tax breaks (ph)
to help this work and Governor Romney says


261
0:19:53,12 --> 0:19:57,42
I’m opposed. I’d get rid of it.
That’s not an energy strategy for the future.


262
0:19:57,42 --> 0:20:0,62
And we need to win that future. And I intend
to win it as President of the United States.


263
0:20:0,62 --> 0:20:2,3
CROWLEY: I got to — I got to move you on
–


264
0:20:2,3 --> 0:20:3,0
ROMNEY: He gets the first –
CROWLEY: — and the next question –


265
0:20:3,0 --> 0:20:4,14
ROMNEY: He actually got –
CROWLEY: — for you –


266
0:20:4,14 --> 0:20:6,96
ROMNEY: He actually got the first question.
So I get the last question — last answer


267
0:20:6,96 --> 0:20:8,55
–
CROWLEY: (Inaudible) in the follow up, it


268
0:20:8,55 --> 0:20:12,65
doesn’t quite work like that. But I’m
going to give you a chance here. I promise


269
0:20:12,65 --> 0:20:15,12
you, I’m going to.
And the next question is for you. So if you


270
0:20:15,12 --> 0:20:18,87
want to, you know, continue on — but I don’t
want to leave all –


271
0:20:18,87 --> 0:20:19,83
ROMNEY: Candy, Candy –
CROWLEY: — sitting here –


272
0:20:19,83 --> 0:20:24,2
ROMNEY: Candy, I don’t have a policy of
stopping wind jobs in Iowa and that — they’re


273
0:20:24,2 --> 0:20:26,7
not phantom jobs. They’re real jobs.
CROWLEY: OK.


274
0:20:26,7 --> 0:20:31,24
ROMNEY: I appreciate wind jobs in Iowa and
across our country. I appreciate the jobs


275
0:20:31,24 --> 0:20:34,63
in coal and oil and gas. I’m going to make
sure –


276
0:20:34,63 --> 0:20:36,5
CROWLEY: OK.
ROMNEY: — we’re taking advantage of our


277
0:20:36,5 --> 0:20:41,1
energy resources. We’ll bring back manufacturing
to America. We’re going to get through a


278
0:20:41,1 --> 0:20:45,83
very aggressive energy policy, 31/2 million
more jobs in this country. It’s critical


279
0:20:45,83 --> 0:20:47,29
to our future.
OBAMA: Candy, it’s not going to –


280
0:20:47,29 --> 0:20:49,6
CROWLEY: We’re going to move you along –
OBAMA: Used to being interrupted.


281
0:20:49,6 --> 0:20:54,12
CROWLEY: We’re going to move you both along
to taxes over here and all these folks that


282
0:20:54,12 --> 0:20:57,8
have been waiting.
Governor, this question is for you. It comes


283
0:20:57,8 --> 0:21:1,32
from Mary Follano — Follano, sorry.
ROMNEY: Hi, Mary.


284
0:21:1,32 --> 0:21:6,27
QUESTION: Governor Romney, you have stated
that if you’re elected president, you would


285
0:21:6,27 --> 0:21:11,92
plan to reduce the tax rates for all the tax
brackets and that you would work with the


286
0:21:11,92 --> 0:21:18,83
Congress to eliminate some deductions in order
to make up for the loss in revenue.


287
0:21:18,83 --> 0:21:25,79
Concerning the — these various deductions,
the mortgage deductions, the charitable deductions,


288
0:21:25,79 --> 0:21:30,48
the child tax credit and also the — oh,
what’s that other credit? I forgot.


289
0:21:30,48 --> 0:21:36,66
OBAMA: You’re doing great.
QUESTION: Oh, I remember.


290
0:21:36,66 --> 0:21:41,77
The education credits, which are important
to me, because I have children in college.


291
0:21:41,77 --> 0:21:44,99
What would be your position on those things,
which are important to the middle class?


292
0:21:44,99 --> 0:21:49,12
ROMNEY: Thank you very much. And let me tell
you, you’re absolutely right about part


293
0:21:49,12 --> 0:21:55,26
of that, which is I want to bring the rates
down, I want to simplify the tax code, and


294
0:21:55,26 --> 0:22:0,9
I want to get middle- income taxpayers to
have lower taxes.


295
0:22:0,9 --> 0:22:4,91
And the reason I want middle-income taxpayers
to have lower taxes is because middle-income


296
0:22:4,91 --> 0:22:9,6
taxpayers have been buried over the past four
years. You’ve seen, as middle-income people


297
0:22:9,6 --> 0:22:15,16
in this country, incomes go down $4,300 a
family, even as gasoline prices have gone


298
0:22:15,16 --> 0:22:23,5
up $2,000. Health insurance premiums, up $2,500.
Food prices up. Utility prices up.


299
0:22:23,5 --> 0:22:27,92
The middle-income families in America have
been crushed over the last four years. So


300
0:22:27,92 --> 0:22:31,39
I want to get some relief to middle-income
families. That’s part — that’s part


301
0:22:31,39 --> 0:22:33,34
one.
Now, how about deductions? ‘Cause I’m


302
0:22:33,34 --> 0:22:38,36
going to bring rates down across the board
for everybody, but I’m going to limit deductions


303
0:22:38,36 --> 0:22:43,2
and exemptions and credits, particularly for
people at the high end, because I am not going


304
0:22:43,2 --> 0:22:46,77
to have people at the high end pay less than
they’re paying now.


305
0:22:46,77 --> 0:22:53,26
The top 5 percent of taxpayers will continue
to pay 60 percent of the income tax the nation


306
0:22:53,26 --> 0:22:57,94
collects. So that’ll stay the same.
Middle-income people are going to get a tax


307
0:22:57,94 --> 0:23:1,17
break.
And so, in terms of bringing down deductions,


308
0:23:1,17 --> 0:23:5,88
one way of doing that would be say everybody
gets — I’ll pick a number — $25,000


309
0:23:5,88 --> 0:23:11,28
of deductions and credits, and you can decide
which ones to use. Your home mortgage interest


310
0:23:11,28 --> 0:23:15,84
deduction, charity, child tax credit, and
so forth, you can use those as part of filling


311
0:23:15,84 --> 0:23:20,63
that bucket, if you will, of deductions.
But your rate comes down and the burden also


312
0:23:20,63 --> 0:23:26,4
comes down on you for one more reason, and
that is every middle-income taxpayer no longer


313
0:23:26,4 --> 0:23:33,37
will pay any tax on interest, dividends or
capital gains. No tax on your savings. That


314
0:23:33,37 --> 0:23:37,27
makes life a lot easier.
If you’re getting interest from a bank,


315
0:23:37,27 --> 0:23:42,36
if you’re getting a statement from a mutual
fund or any other kind of investment you have,


316
0:23:42,36 --> 0:23:46,64
you don’t have to worry about filing taxes
on that, because there’ll be no taxes for


317
0:23:46,64 --> 0:23:52,75
anybody making $200,000.00 per year and less,
on your interest, dividends and capital gains.


318
0:23:52,75 --> 0:23:56,89
Why am I lowering taxes on the middle-class?
Because under the last four years, they’ve


319
0:23:56,89 --> 0:23:59,71
been buried. And I want to help people in
the middle-class.


320
0:23:59,71 --> 0:24:5,1
And I will not — I will not under any circumstances,
reduce the share that’s being paid by the


321
0:24:5,1 --> 0:24:10,46
highest income taxpayers. And I will not,
under any circumstances increase taxes on


322
0:24:10,46 --> 0:24:16,5
the middle-class. The president’s spending,
the president’s borrowing will cost this


323
0:24:16,5 --> 0:24:20,49
nation to have to raise taxes on the American
people. Not just at the high end. A recent


324
0:24:20,49 --> 0:24:25,87
study has shown the people in the middle-class
will see $4,000.00 per year in higher taxes


325
0:24:25,87 --> 0:24:28,92
as a result of the spending and borrowing
of this administration.


326
0:24:28,92 --> 0:24:33,19
I will not let that happen. I want to get
us on track to a balanced budget, and I’m


327
0:24:33,19 --> 0:24:37,25
going to reduce the tax burden on middle income
families. And what’s that going to do? It’s


328
0:24:37,25 --> 0:24:41,35
going to help those families, and it’s going
to create incentives to start growing jobs


329
0:24:41,35 --> 0:24:45,5
again in this country.
CROWLEY: Thanks, Governor.


330
0:24:45,5 --> 0:24:52,76
OBAMA: My philosophy on taxes has been simple.
And that is, I want to give middle-class families


331
0:24:52,76 --> 0:24:57,5
and folks who are striving to get into the
middle-class some relief. Because they have


332
0:24:57,5 --> 0:25:2,7
been hit hard over the last decade. Over the
last 15, over the last 20 years.


333
0:25:2,7 --> 0:25:5,59
So four years ago I stood on a stage just
like this one. Actually it was a town hall,


334
0:25:5,59 --> 0:25:11,5
and I said I would cut taxes for middle- class
families, and that’s what I’ve done, by


335
0:25:11,5 --> 0:25:15,83
$3,600.00. I said I would cut taxes for small
businesses, who are the drivers and engines


336
0:25:15,83 --> 0:25:22,89
of growth. And we’ve cut them 18 times.
And I want to continue those tax cuts for


337
0:25:22,89 --> 0:25:29,84
middle-class families, and for small business.
But what I’ve also said is, if we’re serious


338
0:25:29,84 --> 0:25:36,59
about reducing the deficit, if this is genuinely
a moral obligation to the next generation,


339
0:25:36,59 --> 0:25:42,92
then in addition to some tough spending cuts,
we’ve also got to make sure that the wealthy


340
0:25:42,92 --> 0:25:46,32
do a little bit more.
So what I’ve said is, your first $250,000.00


341
0:25:46,32 --> 0:25:54,52
worth of income, no change. And that means
98 percent of American families, 97 percent


342
0:25:54,52 --> 0:25:58,69
of small businesses, they will not see a tax
increase. I’m ready to sign that bill right


343
0:25:58,69 --> 0:26:3,65
now. The only reason it’s not happening
is because Governor Romney’s allies in Congress


344
0:26:3,65 --> 0:26:9,2
have held the 98 percent hostage because they
want tax breaks for the top 2 percent.


345
0:26:9,2 --> 0:26:15,87
But what I’ve also says is for above $250,000,
we can go back to the tax rates we had when


346
0:26:15,87 --> 0:26:21,42
Bill Clinton was president. We created 23
million new jobs. That’s part of what took


347
0:26:21,42 --> 0:26:27,59
us from deficits to surplus. It will be good
for our economy and it will be good for job


348
0:26:27,59 --> 0:26:32,35
creation.
Now, Governor Romney has a different philosophy.


349
0:26:32,35 --> 0:26:39,23
He was on 60 Minutes just two weeks ago and
he was asked: Is it fair for somebody like


350
0:26:39,23 --> 0:26:44,57
you, making $20 million a year, to pay a lower
tax rate than a nurse or a bus driver, somebody


351
0:26:44,57 --> 0:26:49,28
making $50,000 year? And he said, “Yes,
I think that’s fair.” Not only that, he


352
0:26:49,28 --> 0:26:55,8
said, “I think that’s what grows the economy.”
Well, I fundamentally disagree with that.


353
0:26:55,8 --> 0:27:0,36
I think what grows the economy is when you
get that tax credit that we put in place for


354
0:27:0,36 --> 0:27:5,33
your kids going to college. I think that grows
the economy. I think what grows the economy


355
0:27:5,33 --> 0:27:9,52
is when we make sure small businesses are
getting a tax credit for hiring veterans who


356
0:27:9,52 --> 0:27:13,98
fought for our country. That grows our economy.
So we just have a different theory. And when


357
0:27:13,98 --> 0:27:19,84
Governor Romney stands here, after a year
of campaigning, when during a Republican primary


358
0:27:19,84 --> 0:27:24,69
he stood on stage and said “I’m going
to give tax cuts” — he didn’t say tax


359
0:27:24,69 --> 0:27:29,63
rate cuts, he said “tax cuts to everybody,”
including the top 1 percent, you should believe


360
0:27:29,63 --> 0:27:34,8
him because that’s been his history.
And that’s exactly the kind of top-down


361
0:27:34,8 --> 0:27:39,67
economics that is not going to work if we
want a strong middle class and an economy


362
0:27:39,67 --> 0:27:43,66
that’s striving for everybody.
CROWLEY: Governor Romney, I’m sure you’ve


363
0:27:43,66 --> 0:27:47,63
got a reply there.
(LAUGHTER) ROMNEY: You’re absolutely right.


364
0:27:47,63 --> 0:27:52,96
You heard what I said about my tax plan. The
top 5 percent will continue to pay 60 percent,


365
0:27:52,96 --> 0:27:57,7
as they do today. I’m not looking to cut
taxes for wealthy people. I am looking to


366
0:27:57,7 --> 0:28:2,82
cut taxes for middle-income people.
And why do I want to bring rates down, and


367
0:28:2,82 --> 0:28:7,61
at the same time lower exemptions and deductions,
particularly for people at the high end? Because


368
0:28:7,61 --> 0:28:12,91
if you bring rates down, it makes it easier
for small business to keep more of their capital


369
0:28:12,91 --> 0:28:17,7
and hire people.
And for me, this is about jobs. I want to


370
0:28:17,7 --> 0:28:23,65
get America’s economy going again. Fifty-four
percent of America’s workers work in businesses


371
0:28:23,65 --> 0:28:29,27
that are taxed as individuals. So when you
bring those rates down, those small businesses


372
0:28:29,27 --> 0:28:31,92
are able to keep more money and hire more
people.


373
0:28:31,92 --> 0:28:37,15
For me, I look at what’s happened in the
last four years and say this has been a disappointment.


374
0:28:37,15 --> 0:28:42,8
We can do better than this. We don’t have
to settle for, how many months, 43 months


375
0:28:42,8 --> 0:28:47,3
with unemployment above 8 percent, 23 million
Americans struggling to find a good job right


376
0:28:47,3 --> 0:28:50,87
now.
There are 3.5 million more women living in


377
0:28:50,87 --> 0:28:53,96
poverty today than when the president took
office.


378
0:28:53,96 --> 0:28:58,41
We don’t have to live like this. We can
get this economy going again. My five-point


379
0:28:58,41 --> 0:29:3,66
plan does it. Energy independence for North
America in five years. Opening up more trade,


380
0:29:3,66 --> 0:29:7,7
particularly in Latin America. Cracking down
on China when they cheat. Getting us to a


381
0:29:7,7 --> 0:29:12,73
balanced budget. Fixing our training programs
for our workers. And finally, championing


382
0:29:12,73 --> 0:29:17,17
small business.
I want to make small businesses grow and thrive.


383
0:29:17,17 --> 0:29:21,89
I know how to make that happen. I spent my
life in the private sector. I know why jobs


384
0:29:21,89 --> 0:29:26,64
come and why they go. And they’re going
now because of the policies of this administration.


385
0:29:26,64 --> 0:29:30,55
CROWLEY: Governor, let me ask the president
something about what you just said.


386
0:29:30,55 --> 0:29:37,37
The governor says that he is not going to
allow the top 5 percent, believe is what he


387
0:29:37,37 --> 0:29:41,91
said, to have a tax cut, that it will all
even out, that what he wants to do is give


388
0:29:41,91 --> 0:29:48,14
that tax cut to the middle class. Settled?
OBAMA: No, it’s not settled.


389
0:29:48,14 --> 0:29:57,92
Look, the cost of lowering rates for everybody
across the board, 20 percent. Along with what


390
0:29:57,92 --> 0:30:2,25
he also wants to do in terms of eliminating
the estate tax, along what he wants to do


391
0:30:2,25 --> 0:30:8,77
in terms of corporates, changes in the tax
code, it costs about $5 trillion.


392
0:30:8,77 --> 0:30:13,78
Governor Romney then also wants to spend $2
trillion on additional military programs even


393
0:30:13,78 --> 0:30:17,61
though the military’s not asking for them.
That’s $7 trillion.


394
0:30:17,61 --> 0:30:22,78
He also wants to continue the Bush tax cuts
for the wealthiest Americans. That’s another


395
0:30:22,78 --> 0:30:29,33
trillion dollars — that’s $8 trillion.
Now, what he says is he’s going to make


396
0:30:29,33 --> 0:30:34,64
sure that this doesn’t add to the deficit
and he’s going to cut middleclass taxes.


397
0:30:34,64 --> 0:30:40,12
But when he’s asked, how are you going to
do it, which deductions, which loopholes are


398
0:30:40,12 --> 0:30:47,7
you going to close? He can’t tell you.
The — the fact that he only has to pay 14


399
0:30:47,7 --> 0:30:52,89
percent on his taxes when a lot of you are
paying much higher. He’s already taken that


400
0:30:52,89 --> 0:30:57,86
off the board, capital gains are going to
continue to be at a low rate so we — we’re


401
0:30:57,86 --> 0:31:3,13
not going to get money that way.
We haven’t heard from the governor any specifics


402
0:31:3,13 --> 0:31:8,38
beyond Big Bird and eliminating funding for
Planned Parenthood in terms of how he pays


403
0:31:8,38 --> 0:31:12,35
for that.
Now, Governor Romney was a very successful


404
0:31:12,35 --> 0:31:18,51
investor. If somebody came to you, Governor,
with a plan that said, here, I want to spend


405
0:31:18,51 --> 0:31:25,48
$7 or $8 trillion, and then we’re going
to pay for it, but we can’t tell you until


406
0:31:25,48 --> 0:31:29,98
maybe after the election how we’re going
to do it, you wouldn’t take such a sketchy


407
0:31:29,98 --> 0:31:37,42
deal and neither should you, the American
people, because the math doesn’t add up.


408
0:31:37,42 --> 0:31:42,76
And — and what’s at stake here is one
of two things, either Candy — this blows


409
0:31:42,76 --> 0:31:48,98
up the deficit because keep in mind, this
is just to pay for the additional spending


410
0:31:48,98 --> 0:31:52,26
that he’s talking about, $7 trillion – $8
trillion before we even get to the deficit


411
0:31:52,26 --> 0:31:58,6
we already have. Or, alternatively, it’s
got to be paid for, not only by closing deductions


412
0:31:58,6 --> 0:32:4,5
for wealthy individuals, that — that will
pay for about 4 percent reduction in tax rates.


413
0:32:4,5 --> 0:32:8,88
You’re going to be paying for it. You’re
going to lose some deductions, and you can’t


414
0:32:8,88 --> 0:32:13,62
buy the sales pitch. Nobody who’s looked
at it that’s serious, actually believes


415
0:32:13,62 --> 0:32:15,5
it adds up.
CROWLEY: Mr. President, let me get — let


416
0:32:15,5 --> 0:32:19,21
me get the governor in on this. And Governor,
let’s — before we get into a…


417
0:32:19,21 --> 0:32:22,17
ROMNEY: I — I…
CROWLEY: …vast array of who says — what


418
0:32:22,17 --> 0:32:28,26
study says what, if it shouldn’t add up.
If somehow when you get in there, there isn’t


419
0:32:28,26 --> 0:32:33,82
enough tax revenue coming in. If somehow the
numbers don’t add up, would you be willing


420
0:32:33,82 --> 0:32:39,83
to look again at a 20 percent…
ROMNEY: Well of course they add up. I — I


421
0:32:39,83 --> 0:32:46,2
was — I was someone who ran businesses for
25 years, and balanced the budget. I ran the


422
0:32:46,2 --> 0:32:51,96
Olympics and balanced the budget. I ran the
— the state of Massachusetts as a governor,


423
0:32:51,96 --> 0:32:56,11
to the extent any governor does, and balanced
the budget all four years. When we’re talking


424
0:32:56,11 --> 0:33:1,0
about math that doesn’t add up, how about
$4 trillion of deficits over the last four


425
0:33:1,0 --> 0:33:7,22
years, $5 trillion? That’s math that doesn’t
add up. We have — we have a president talking


426
0:33:7,22 --> 0:33:13,48
about someone’s plan in a way that’s completely
foreign to what my real plan is.


427
0:33:13,48 --> 0:33:19,13
ROMNEY: And then we have his own record, which
is we have four consecutive years where he


428
0:33:19,13 --> 0:33:23,54
said when he was running for office, he would
cut the deficit in half. Instead he’s doubled


429
0:33:23,54 --> 0:33:30,28
it. We’ve gone from $10 trillion of national
debt, to $16 trillion of national debt. If


430
0:33:30,28 --> 0:33:35,35
the president were reelected, we’d go to
almost $20 trillion of national debt. This


431
0:33:35,35 --> 0:33:39,8
puts us on a road to Greece. I know what it
takes to balance budgets. I’ve done it my


432
0:33:39,8 --> 0:33:44,73
entire life. So for instance when he says,
“Yours is a $5 trillion cut.” Well, no


433
0:33:44,73 --> 0:33:49,53
it’s not. Because I’m offsetting some
of the reductions with holding down some of


434
0:33:49,53 --> 0:33:50,28
the deductions.
And…


435
0:33:50,28 --> 0:33:53,31
CROWLEY: Governor, I’ve gotta — gotta
— actually, I need to have you both (inaudible).


436
0:33:53,31 --> 0:33:55,44
(CROSSTALK)
CROWLEY: I understand the stakes here. I understand


437
0:33:55,44 --> 0:33:58,15
both of you. But I — I will get run out
of town if I don’t…


438
0:33:58,15 --> 0:33:59,46
(CROSSTALK)
ROMNEY: And I just described — I just described


439
0:33:59,46 --> 0:34:3,2
to you, Mr. President — I just described
to you precisely how I’d do it which is


440
0:34:3,2 --> 0:34:7,46
with a single number that people can put — and
they can put they’re — they’re deductions


441
0:34:7,46 --> 0:34:8,399
and credits…
(CROSSTALK)


442
0:34:8,399 --> 0:34:12,129
CROWLEY: Mr. President, we’re keeping track,
I promise you. And Mr. President, the next


443
0:34:12,129 --> 0:34:14,759
question is for you, so stay standing.
OBAMA: Great. Looking forward to it.


444
0:34:14,759 --> 0:34:21,19
And it’s Katherine Fenton, who has a question
for you.


445
0:34:21,19 --> 0:34:27,529
QUESTION: In what new ways to you intend to
rectify the inequalities in the workplace,


446
0:34:27,529 --> 0:34:31,599
specifically regarding females making only
72 percent of what their male counterparts


447
0:34:31,599 --> 0:34:35,29
earn?
OBAMA: Well, Katherine, that’s a great question.


448
0:34:35,29 --> 0:34:41,99
And, you know, I was raised by a single mom
who had to put herself through school while


449
0:34:41,99 --> 0:34:48,19
looking after two kids. And she worked hard
every day and made a lot of sacrifices to


450
0:34:48,19 --> 0:34:55,259
make sure we got everything we needed. My
grandmother, she started off as a secretary


451
0:34:55,259 --> 0:35:0,9
in a bank. She never got a college education,
even though she was smart as a whip. And she


452
0:35:0,9 --> 0:35:7,49
worked her way up to become a vice president
of a local bank, but she hit the glass ceiling.


453
0:35:7,49 --> 0:35:13,369
She trained people who would end up becoming
her bosses during the course of her career.


454
0:35:13,369 --> 0:35:19,69
She didn’t complain. That’s not what you
did in that generation. And this is one of


455
0:35:19,69 --> 0:35:24,509
the reasons why one of the first — the first
bill I signed was something called the Lily


456
0:35:24,509 --> 0:35:30,92
Ledbetter bill. And it’s named after this
amazing woman who had been doing the same


457
0:35:30,92 --> 0:35:39,369
job as a man for years, found out that she
was getting paid less, and the Supreme Court


458
0:35:39,369 --> 0:35:42,43
said that she couldn’t bring suit because
she should have found about it earlier, whereas


459
0:35:42,43 --> 0:35:48,18
she had no way of finding out about it. So
we fixed that. And that’s an example of


460
0:35:48,18 --> 0:35:55,18
the kind of advocacy that we need, because
women are increasingly the breadwinners in


461
0:35:55,18 --> 0:36:1,569
the family. This is not just a women’s issue,
this is a family issue, this is a middle-class


462
0:36:1,569 --> 0:36:4,779
issue, and that’s why we’ve got to fight
for it.


463
0:36:4,779 --> 0:36:9,45
It also means that we’ve got to make sure
that young people like yourself are able to


464
0:36:9,45 --> 0:36:13,549
afford a college education. Earlier, Governor
Romney talked about he wants to make Pell


465
0:36:13,549 --> 0:36:18,79
Grants and other education accessible for
young people.


466
0:36:18,79 --> 0:36:21,779
Well, the truth of the matter is, is that
that’s exactly what we’ve done. We’ve


467
0:36:21,779 --> 0:36:25,509
expanded Pell Grants for millions of people,
including millions of young women, all across


468
0:36:25,509 --> 0:36:29,319
the country.
We did it by taking $60 billion that was going


469
0:36:29,319 --> 0:36:36,119
to banks and lenders as middlemen for the
student loan program, and we said, let’s


470
0:36:36,119 --> 0:36:38,73
just cut out the middleman. Let’s give the
money directly to students.


471
0:36:38,73 --> 0:36:43,68
And as a consequence, we’ve seen millions
of young people be able to afford college,


472
0:36:43,68 --> 0:36:46,579
and that’s going to make sure that young
women are going to be able to compete in that


473
0:36:46,579 --> 0:36:49,16
marketplace.
But we’ve got to enforce the laws, which


474
0:36:49,16 --> 0:36:55,98
is what we are doing, and we’ve also got
to make sure that in every walk of life we


475
0:36:55,98 --> 0:36:59,94
do not tolerate discrimination.
That’s been one of the hallmarks of my administration.


476
0:36:59,94 --> 0:37:4,49
I’m going to continue to push on this issue
for the next four years.


477
0:37:4,49 --> 0:37:10,529
CROWLEY: Governor Romney, pay equity for women?
ROMNEY: Thank you. And important topic, and


478
0:37:10,529 --> 0:37:15,65
one which I learned a great deal about, particularly
as I was serving as governor of my state,


479
0:37:15,65 --> 0:37:22,9
because I had the chance to pull together
a cabinet and all the applicants seemed to


480
0:37:22,9 --> 0:37:24,289
be men.
And I — and I went to my staff, and I said,


481
0:37:24,289 --> 0:37:26,799
“How come all the people for these jobs
are — are all men.” They said, “Well,


482
0:37:26,799 --> 0:37:30,299
these are the people that have the qualifications.”
And I said, “Well, gosh, can’t we — can’t


483
0:37:30,299 --> 0:37:33,16
we find some — some women that are also
qualified?”


484
0:37:33,16 --> 0:37:39,49
ROMNEY: And — and so we — we took a concerted
effort to go out and find women who had backgrounds


485
0:37:39,49 --> 0:37:41,93
that could be qualified to become members
of our cabinet.


486
0:37:41,93 --> 0:37:44,9
I went to a number of women’s groups and
said, “Can you help us find folks,” and


487
0:37:44,9 --> 0:37:49,99
they brought us whole binders full of women.
I was proud of the fact that after I staffed


488
0:37:49,99 --> 0:37:55,789
my Cabinet and my senior staff, that the University
of New York in Albany did a survey of all


489
0:37:55,789 --> 0:38:0,759
50 states, and concluded that mine had more
women in senior leadership positions than


490
0:38:0,759 --> 0:38:4,42
any other state in America.
Now one of the reasons I was able to get so


491
0:38:4,42 --> 0:38:8,19
many good women to be part of that team was
because of our recruiting effort. But number


492
0:38:8,19 --> 0:38:11,559
two, because I recognized that if you’re
going to have women in the workforce that


493
0:38:11,559 --> 0:38:15,89
sometimes you need to be more flexible. My
chief of staff, for instance, had two kids


494
0:38:15,89 --> 0:38:19,769
that were still in school.
She said, I can’t be here until 7 or 8 o’clock


495
0:38:19,769 --> 0:38:24,809
at night. I need to be able to get home at
5 o’clock so I can be there for making dinner


496
0:38:24,809 --> 0:38:28,68
for my kids and being with them when they
get home from school. So we said fine. Let’s


497
0:38:28,68 --> 0:38:31,63
have a flexible schedule so you can have hours
that work for you.


498
0:38:31,63 --> 0:38:35,88
We’re going to have to have employers in
the new economy, in the economy I’m going


499
0:38:35,88 --> 0:38:40,48
to bring to play, that are going to be so
anxious to get good workers they’re going


500
0:38:40,48 --> 0:38:47,91
to be anxious to hire women. In the — in
the last women have lost 580,000 jobs. That’s


501
0:38:47,91 --> 0:38:53,39
the net of what’s happened in the last four
years. We’re still down 580,000 jobs. I


502
0:38:53,39 --> 0:38:58,319
mentioned 31/2 million women, more now in
poverty than four years ago.


503
0:38:58,319 --> 0:39:3,99
What we can do to help young women and women
of all ages is to have a strong economy, so


504
0:39:3,99 --> 0:39:8,19
strong that employers that are looking to
find good employees and bringing them into


505
0:39:8,19 --> 0:39:14,88
their workforce and adapting to a flexible
work schedule that gives women opportunities


506
0:39:14,88 --> 0:39:19,549
that they would otherwise not be able to afford.
This is what I have done. It’s what I look


507
0:39:19,549 --> 0:39:24,75
forward to doing and I know what it takes
to make an economy work, and I know what a


508
0:39:24,75 --> 0:39:29,839
working economy looks like. And an economy
with 7.8 percent unemployment is not a real


509
0:39:29,839 --> 0:39:37,47
strong economy. An economy that has 23 million
people looking for work is not a strong economy.


510
0:39:37,47 --> 0:39:43,269
An economy with 50 percent of kids graduating
from college that can’t finds a job, or


511
0:39:43,269 --> 0:39:45,819
a college level job, that’s not what we
have to have. CROWLEY: Governor?


512
0:39:45,819 --> 0:39:50,75
ROMNEY: I’m going to help women in America
get good work by getting a stronger economy


513
0:39:50,75 --> 0:39:54,309
and by supporting women in the workforce.
CROWLEY: Mr. President why don’t you get


514
0:39:54,309 --> 0:39:55,99
in on this quickly, please?
OBAMA: Katherine, I just want to point out


515
0:39:55,99 --> 0:40:0,789
that when Governor Romney’s campaign was
asked about the Lilly Ledbetter bill, whether


516
0:40:0,789 --> 0:40:5,569
he supported it? He said, “I’ll get back
to you.” And that’s not the kind of advocacy


517
0:40:5,569 --> 0:40:12,44
that women need in any economy. Now, there
are some other issues that have a bearing


518
0:40:12,44 --> 0:40:19,72
on how women succeed in the workplace. For
example, their healthcare. You know a major


519
0:40:19,72 --> 0:40:27,39
difference in this campaign is that Governor
Romney feels comfortable having politicians


520
0:40:27,39 --> 0:40:31,499
in Washington decide the health care choices
that women are making.


521
0:40:31,499 --> 0:40:37,18
I think that’s a mistake. In my health care
bill, I said insurance companies need to provide


522
0:40:37,18 --> 0:40:44,49
contraceptive coverage to everybody who is
insured. Because this is not just a — a


523
0:40:44,49 --> 0:40:49,59
health issue, it’s an economic issue for
women. It makes a difference. This is money


524
0:40:49,59 --> 0:40:56,13
out of that family’s pocket. Governor Romney
not only opposed it, he suggested that in


525
0:40:56,13 --> 0:41:2,24
fact employers should be able to make the
decision as to whether or not a woman gets


526
0:41:2,24 --> 0:41:7,98
contraception through her insurance coverage.
That’s not the kind of advocacy that women


527
0:41:7,98 --> 0:41:13,44
need. When Governor Romney says that we should
eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood,


528
0:41:13,44 --> 0:41:19,369
there are millions of women all across the
country, who rely on Planned Parenthood for,


529
0:41:19,369 --> 0:41:24,71
not just contraceptive care, they rely on
it for mammograms, for cervical cancer screenings.


530
0:41:24,71 --> 0:41:30,68
That’s a pocketbook issue for women and
families all across the country. And it makes


531
0:41:30,68 --> 0:41:36,17
a difference in terms of how well and effectively
women are able to work. When we talk about


532
0:41:36,17 --> 0:41:41,98
child care, and the credits that we’re providing.
That makes a difference in whether they can


533
0:41:41,98 --> 0:41:45,96
go out there and — and earn a living for
their family.


534
0:41:45,96 --> 0:41:51,779
These are not just women’s issues. These
are family issues. These are economic issues.


535
0:41:51,779 --> 0:41:58,13
And one of the things that makes us grow as
an economy is when everybody participates


536
0:41:58,13 --> 0:42:1,13
and women are getting the same fair deal as
men are.


537
0:42:1,13 --> 0:42:2,66
CROWLEY: Mr. President…
OBAMA: And I’ve got two daughters and I


538
0:42:2,66 --> 0:42:8,45
want to make sure that they have the same
opportunities that anybody’s sons have.


539
0:42:8,45 --> 0:42:11,43
That’s part of what I’m fighting for as
president of the United States.


540
0:42:11,43 --> 0:42:15,859
CROWLEY: I want to move us along here to Susan
Katz, who has a question.


541
0:42:15,859 --> 0:42:24,819
And, Governor, it’s for you. QUESTION: Governor
Romney, I am an undecided voter, because I’m


542
0:42:24,819 --> 0:42:31,359
disappointed with the lack of progress I’ve
seen in the last four years. However, I do


543
0:42:31,359 --> 0:42:36,789
attribute much of America’s economic and
international problems to the failings and


544
0:42:36,789 --> 0:42:44,68
missteps of the Bush administration.
Since both you and President Bush are Republicans,


545
0:42:44,68 --> 0:42:51,39
I fear a return to the policies of those years
should you win this election. What is the


546
0:42:51,39 --> 0:42:58,359
biggest difference between you and George
W. Bush, and how do you differentiate yourself


547
0:42:58,359 --> 0:43:2,91
from George W. Bush?
ROMNEY: Thank you. And I appreciate that question.


548
0:43:2,91 --> 0:43:7,259
I just want to make sure that, I think I was
supposed to get that last answer, but I want


549
0:43:7,259 --> 0:43:9,839
to point out that that I don’t believe…
OBAMA: I don’t think so, Candy.


550
0:43:9,839 --> 0:43:12,7
ROMNEY: … I don’t believe…
OBAMA: I want to make sure our timekeepers


551
0:43:12,7 --> 0:43:13,569
are working here.
ROMNEY: The time — the time…


552
0:43:13,569 --> 0:43:18,45
CROWLEY: OK. The timekeepers are all working.
And let me tell you that the last part, it’s


553
0:43:18,45 --> 0:43:22,43
for the two of you to talk to one another,
and it isn’t quite as (inaudible) you think.


554
0:43:22,43 --> 0:43:26,269
But go ahead and use this two minutes any
way you’d like to, the question is on the


555
0:43:26,269 --> 0:43:28,72
floor.
ROMNEY: I’d just note that I don’t believe


556
0:43:28,72 --> 0:43:32,69
that bureaucrats in Washington should tell
someone whether they can use contraceptives


557
0:43:32,69 --> 0:43:35,95
or not. And I don’t believe employers should
tell someone whether they could have contraceptive


558
0:43:35,95 --> 0:43:40,42
care of not. Every woman in America should
have access to contraceptives. And — and


559
0:43:40,42 --> 0:43:44,29
the — and the president’s statement of
my policy is completely and totally wrong.


560
0:43:44,29 --> 0:43:46,339
OBAMA: Governor…
ROMNEY: Let me come back and — and answer


561
0:43:46,339 --> 0:43:49,249
your question.
President Bush and I are — are different


562
0:43:49,249 --> 0:43:54,22
people and these are different times and that’s
why my five point plan is so different than


563
0:43:54,22 --> 0:43:57,569
what he would have done.
I mean for instance, we can now, by virtue


564
0:43:57,569 --> 0:44:3,23
of new technology actually get all the energy
we need in North America without having to


565
0:44:3,23 --> 0:44:6,72
go to the — the Arabs or the Venezuelans
or anyone else. That wasn’t true in his


566
0:44:6,72 --> 0:44:11,529
time, that’s why my policy starts with a
very robust policy to get all that energy


567
0:44:11,529 --> 0:44:16,64
in North America — become energy secure.
Number two, trade — I’ll crack down on


568
0:44:16,64 --> 0:44:21,529
China, President Bush didn’t. I’m also
going to dramatically expand trade in Latin


569
0:44:21,529 --> 0:44:24,809
America. It’s been growing about 12 percent
per year over a long period of time. I want


570
0:44:24,809 --> 0:44:28,44
to add more free trade agreements so we’ll
have more trade.


571
0:44:28,44 --> 0:44:33,4
Number three, I’m going to get us to a balanced
budget. President Bush didn’t. President


572
0:44:33,4 --> 0:44:38,549
Obama was right, he said that that was outrageous
to have deficits as high as half a trillion


573
0:44:38,549 --> 0:44:43,59
dollars under the Bush years. He was right,
but then he put in place deficits twice that


574
0:44:43,59 --> 0:44:48,92
size for every one of his four years. And
his forecast for the next four years is more


575
0:44:48,92 --> 0:44:53,539
deficits, almost that large. So that’s the
next area I’m different than President Bush.


576
0:44:53,539 --> 0:44:58,299
And then let’s take the last one, championing
small business. Our party has been focused


577
0:44:58,299 --> 0:45:4,65
too long. I came through small business. I
understand how hard it is to start a small


578
0:45:4,65 --> 0:45:9,519
business. That’s why everything I’ll do
is designed to help small businesses grow


579
0:45:9,519 --> 0:45:15,569
and add jobs. I want to keep their taxes down
on small business. I want regulators to see


580
0:45:15,569 --> 0:45:20,14
their job as encouraging small enterprise,
not crushing it.


581
0:45:20,14 --> 0:45:24,9
And the thing I find the most troubling about
Obama Care, well it’s a long list, but one


582
0:45:24,9 --> 0:45:28,579
of the things I find most troubling is that
when you go out and talk to small businesses


583
0:45:28,579 --> 0:45:33,39
and ask them what they think about it, they
tell you it keeps them from hiring more people.


584
0:45:33,39 --> 0:45:38,44
My priority is jobs. I know how to make that
happen. And President Bush has a very different


585
0:45:38,44 --> 0:45:44,46
path for a very different time. My path is
designed in getting small businesses to grow


586
0:45:44,46 --> 0:45:48,79
and hire people.
CROWLEY: Thanks, Governor.


587
0:45:48,79 --> 0:45:52,309
Mr. President?
OBAMA: Well, first of all, I think it’s


588
0:45:52,309 --> 0:45:58,119
important to tell you that we did come in
during some tough times. We were losing 800,000


589
0:45:58,119 --> 0:46:5,299
jobs a month when I started. But we had been
digging our way out of policies that were


590
0:46:5,299 --> 0:46:11,69
misplaced and focused on the top doing very
well and middle class folks not doing well.


591
0:46:11,69 --> 0:46:18,569
Now, we’ve seen 30 consecutive — 31 consecutive
months of job growth; 5.2 million new jobs


592
0:46:18,569 --> 0:46:25,16
created. And the plans that I talked about
will create even more. But when Governor Romney


593
0:46:25,16 --> 0:46:30,14
says that he has a very different economic
plan, the centerpiece of his economic plan


594
0:46:30,14 --> 0:46:37,66
are tax cuts. That’s what took us from surplus
to deficit. When he talks about getting tough


595
0:46:37,66 --> 0:46:44,73
on China, keep in mind that Governor Romney
invested in companies that were pioneers of


596
0:46:44,73 --> 0:46:53,49
outsourcing to China, and is currently investing
in countries — in companies that are building


597
0:46:53,49 --> 0:46:57,71
surveillance equipment for China to spy on
its own folks.


598
0:46:57,71 --> 0:47:2,269
That’s — Governor, you’re the last person
who’s going to get tough on China. And what


599
0:47:2,269 --> 0:47:7,15
we’ve done when it comes to trade is not
only sign three trade deals to open up new


600
0:47:7,15 --> 0:47:13,569
markets, but we’ve also set up a task force
for trade that goes after anybody who is taking


601
0:47:13,569 --> 0:47:16,99
advantage of American workers or businesses
and not creating a level playing field. We’ve


602
0:47:16,99 --> 0:47:23,849
brought twice as many cases against unfair
trading practices than the previous administration


603
0:47:23,849 --> 0:47:26,94
and we’ve won every single one that’s
been decided.


604
0:47:26,94 --> 0:47:32,749
When I said that we had to make sure that
China was not flooding our domestic market


605
0:47:32,749 --> 0:47:37,93
with cheap tires, Governor Romney said I was
being protectionist; that it wouldn’t be


606
0:47:37,93 --> 0:47:42,499
helpful to American workers. Well, in fact
we saved 1,000 jobs. And that’s the kind


607
0:47:42,499 --> 0:47:48,759
of tough trade actions that are required.
But the last point I want to make is this.


608
0:47:48,759 --> 0:47:54,71
You know, there are some things where Governor
Romney is different from George Bush. George


609
0:47:54,71 --> 0:48:0,71
Bush didn’t propose turning Medicare into
a voucher. George Bush embraced comprehensive


610
0:48:0,71 --> 0:48:8,65
immigration reform. He didn’t call for self-deportation.
George Bush never suggested that we eliminate


611
0:48:8,65 --> 0:48:15,859
funding for Planned Parenthood, so there are
differences between Governor Romney and George


612
0:48:15,859 --> 0:48:21,329
Bush, but they’re not on economic policy.
In some ways, he’s gone to a more extreme


613
0:48:21,329 --> 0:48:25,519
place when it comes to social policy. And
I think that’s a mistake. That’s not how


614
0:48:25,519 --> 0:48:28,829
we’re going to move our economy forward.
CROWLEY: I want to move you both along to


615
0:48:28,829 --> 0:48:33,47
the next question, because it’s in the same
wheelhouse, so you will be able to respond.


616
0:48:33,47 --> 0:48:39,63
But the president does get this question.
I want to call on Michael Jones.


617
0:48:39,63 --> 0:48:47,22
QUESTION: Mr. President, I voted for you in
2008. What have you done or accomplished to


618
0:48:47,22 --> 0:48:54,41
earn my vote in 2012? I’m not that optimistic
as I was in 2012. Most things I need for everyday


619
0:48:54,41 --> 0:49:0,19
living are very expensive.
OBAMA: Well, we’ve gone through a tough


620
0:49:0,19 --> 0:49:5,19
four years. There’s no doubt about it. But
four years ago, I told the American people


621
0:49:5,19 --> 0:49:10,369
and I told you I would cut taxes for middle
class families. And I did. I told you I’d


622
0:49:10,369 --> 0:49:15,9
cut taxes for small businesses, and I have.
I said that I’d end the war in Iraq, and


623
0:49:15,9 --> 0:49:21,739
I did. I said we’d refocus attention on
those who actually attacked us on 9/11, and


624
0:49:21,739 --> 0:49:26,97
we have gone after Al Qaeda’s leadership
like never before and Osama bin Laden is dead.


625
0:49:26,97 --> 0:49:32,47
OBAMA: I said that we would put in place health
care reform to make sure that insurance companies


626
0:49:32,47 --> 0:49:35,22
can’t jerk you around and if you don’t
have health insurance, that you’d have a


627
0:49:35,22 --> 0:49:38,67
chance to get affordable insurance, and I
have.


628
0:49:38,67 --> 0:49:43,999
I committed that I would rein in the excesses
of Wall Street, and we passed the toughest


629
0:49:43,999 --> 0:49:50,94
Wall Street reforms since the 1930s. We’ve
created five million jobs, and gone from 800


630
0:49:50,94 --> 0:49:55,14
jobs a month being lost, and we are making
progress. We saved an auto industry that was


631
0:49:55,14 --> 0:50:1,14
on the brink of collapse.
Now, does that mean you’re not struggling?


632
0:50:1,14 --> 0:50:6,799
Absolutely not. A lot of us are. And that’s
why the plan that I’ve put forward for manufacturing


633
0:50:6,799 --> 0:50:13,609
and education, and reducing our deficit in
a sensible way, using the savings from ending


634
0:50:13,609 --> 0:50:20,47
wars, to rebuild America and putting people
back to work. Making sure that we are controlling


635
0:50:20,47 --> 0:50:23,98
our own energy, but not only the energy of
today, but also the energy of the future.


636
0:50:23,98 --> 0:50:28,97
All of those things will make a difference,
so the point is the commitments I’ve made,


637
0:50:28,97 --> 0:50:32,369
I’ve kept.
And those that I haven’t been able to keep,


638
0:50:32,369 --> 0:50:37,359
it’s not for lack of trying and we’re
going to get it done in a second term. But,


639
0:50:37,359 --> 0:50:40,91
you should pay attention to this campaign,
because Governor Romney has made some commitments


640
0:50:40,91 --> 0:50:47,72
as well. And I suspect he’ll keep those
too. You know when members of the Republican


641
0:50:47,72 --> 0:50:54,21
Congress say, “We’re going to sign a no
tax pledge, so that we don’t ask a dime


642
0:50:54,21 --> 0:50:58,609
for millionaires and billionaires to reduce
our deficit so we can still invest in education,


643
0:50:58,609 --> 0:51:3,769
and helping kids go to college. He said, “Me
too.”


644
0:51:3,769 --> 0:51:8,999
When they said, “We’re going to cut Planned
Parenthood funding.” He said, “Me too.”


645
0:51:8,999 --> 0:51:13,39
When he said, “We’re going to repeal Obamacare.
First thing I’m going to do,” despite


646
0:51:13,39 --> 0:51:16,98
the fact that it’s the same health care
plan that he passed in Massachusetts and is


647
0:51:16,98 --> 0:51:23,569
working well. He said, “Me too.” That
is not the kind of leadership that you need,


648
0:51:23,569 --> 0:51:26,2
but you should expect that those are promises
he’s going to keep.


649
0:51:26,2 --> 0:51:27,44
(CROSSTALK)
CROWLEY: Mr. President, let me let…


650
0:51:27,44 --> 0:51:28,2
(CROSSTALK)
OBAMA: …the choice in this election is going


651
0:51:28,2 --> 0:51:33,38
to be whose promises are going to be more
likely to help you in your life? Make sure


652
0:51:33,38 --> 0:51:37,13
your kids can go to college. Make sure that
you are getting a good paying job, making


653
0:51:37,13 --> 0:51:38,72
sure that Medicare and Social Security…
(CROSSTALK)


654
0:51:38,72 --> 0:51:38,94
CROWLEY: Mr. President. Thank you.
(CROSSTALK)


655
0:51:38,94 --> 0:51:44,19
OBAMA: …will be there for you.
CROWLEY: Thank you. Governor?


656
0:51:44,19 --> 0:51:48,989
ROMNEY: I think you know better. I think you
know that these last four years haven’t


657
0:51:48,989 --> 0:51:53,42
been so good as the president just described
and that you don’t feel like your confident


658
0:51:53,42 --> 0:51:55,819
that the next four years are going to be much
better either.


659
0:51:55,819 --> 0:51:59,44
I can tell you that if you were to elect President
Obama, you know what you’re going to get.


660
0:51:59,44 --> 0:52:3,39
You’re going to get a repeat of the last
four years. We just can’t afford four more


661
0:52:3,39 --> 0:52:8,279
years like the last four years.
He said that by now we’d have unemployment


662
0:52:8,279 --> 0:52:15,94
at 5.4 percent. The difference between where
it is and 5.4 percent is 9 million Americans


663
0:52:15,94 --> 0:52:20,619
without work.
I wasn’t the one that said 5.4 percent.


664
0:52:20,619 --> 0:52:23,499
This was the president’s plan. Didn’t
get there.


665
0:52:23,499 --> 0:52:29,46
He said he would have by now put forward a
plan to reform Medicare and Social Security,


666
0:52:29,46 --> 0:52:32,829
because he pointed out they’re on the road
to bankruptcy. He would reform them. He’d


667
0:52:32,829 --> 0:52:37,749
get that done. He hasn’t even made a proposal
on either one.


668
0:52:37,749 --> 0:52:41,589
He said in his first year he’d put out an
immigration plan that would deal with our


669
0:52:41,589 --> 0:52:45,599
immigration challenges. Didn’t even file
it.


670
0:52:45,599 --> 0:52:49,17
This is a president who has not been able
to do what he said he’d do. He said that


671
0:52:49,17 --> 0:52:54,68
he’d cut in half the deficit. He hasn’t
done that either. In fact, he doubled it.


672
0:52:54,68 --> 0:52:59,39
He said that by now middle-income families
would have a reduction in their health insurance


673
0:52:59,39 --> 0:53:7,349
premiums by $2,500 a year. It’s gone up
by $2,500 a year. And if Obamacare is passed,


674
0:53:7,349 --> 0:53:11,279
or implemented — it’s already been passed
— if it’s implemented fully, it’ll be


675
0:53:11,279 --> 0:53:15,47
another $2,500 on top.
ROMNEY: The middle class is getting crushed


676
0:53:15,47 --> 0:53:20,14
under the policies of a president who has
not understood what it takes to get the economy


677
0:53:20,14 --> 0:53:24,73
working again. He keeps saying, “Look, I’ve
created 5 million jobs.” That’s after


678
0:53:24,73 --> 0:53:30,489
losing 5 million jobs. The entire record is
such that the unemployment has not been reduced


679
0:53:30,489 --> 0:53:34,42
in this country. The unemployment, the number
of people who are still looking for work,


680
0:53:34,42 --> 0:53:38,859
is still 23 million Americans.
There are more people in poverty, one out


681
0:53:38,859 --> 0:53:42,95
of six people in poverty.
How about food stamps? When he took office,


682
0:53:42,95 --> 0:53:48,95
32 million people were on food stamps. Today,
47 million people are on food stamps. How


683
0:53:48,95 --> 0:53:54,799
about the growth of the economy? It’s growing
more slowly this year than last year, and


684
0:53:54,799 --> 0:54:0,739
more slowly last year than the year before.
The president wants to do well. I understand.


685
0:54:0,739 --> 0:54:6,42
But the policies he’s put in place from
Obamacare to Dodd-Frank to his tax policies


686
0:54:6,42 --> 0:54:11,789
to his regulatory policies, these policies
combined have not let this economy take off


687
0:54:11,789 --> 0:54:14,94
and grow like it could have.
You might say, “Well, you got an example


688
0:54:14,94 --> 0:54:20,72
of one that worked better?” Yeah, in the
Reagan recession where unemployment hit 10.8


689
0:54:20,72 --> 0:54:25,609
percent, between that period — the end of
that recession and the equivalent of time


690
0:54:25,609 --> 0:54:32,89
to today, Ronald Reagan’s recovery created
twice as many jobs as this president’s recovery.


691
0:54:32,89 --> 0:54:36,39
Five million jobs doesn’t even keep up with
our population growth. And the only reason


692
0:54:36,39 --> 0:54:40,259
the unemployment rate seems a little lower
today is because of all the people that have


693
0:54:40,259 --> 0:54:44,769
dropped out of the workforce.
The president has tried, but his policies


694
0:54:44,769 --> 0:54:51,529
haven’t worked. He’s great as a — as
a — as a speaker and describing his plans


695
0:54:51,529 --> 0:54:56,119
and his vision. That’s wonderful, except
we have a record to look at. And that record


696
0:54:56,119 --> 0:55:1,47
shows he just hasn’t been able to cut the
deficit, to put in place reforms for Medicare


697
0:55:1,47 --> 0:55:7,14
and Social Security to preserve them, to get
us the rising incomes we need. Median income


698
0:55:7,14 --> 0:55:12,589
is down $4,300 a family and 23 million Americans
out of work. That’s what this election is


699
0:55:12,589 --> 0:55:17,789
about. It’s about who can get the middle
class in this country a bright and prosperous


700
0:55:17,789 --> 0:55:22,59
future and assure our kids the kind of hope
and optimism they deserve.


701
0:55:22,59 --> 0:55:25,509
CROWLEY: Governor, I want to move you along.
Don’t — don’t go away, and we’ll have


702
0:55:25,509 --> 0:55:29,529
plenty of time to respond. We are quite aware
of the clock for both of you. But I want to


703
0:55:29,529 --> 0:55:34,42
bring in a different subject here.
Mr. President, I’ll be right back with you.


704
0:55:34,42 --> 0:55:38,19
Lorraine Osorio has a question for you about
a topic we have not…


705
0:55:38,19 --> 0:55:39,67
OBAMA: This is for Governor Romney?
CROWLEY: It’s for Governor Romney, and we’ll


706
0:55:39,67 --> 0:55:43,109
be right with you, Mr. President. Thanks.
ROMNEY: Is it Loraina?


707
0:55:43,109 --> 0:55:44,88
QUESTION: Lorraine.
ROMNEY: Lorraine?


708
0:55:44,88 --> 0:55:47,89
QUESTION: Yes, Lorraine.
ROMNEY: Lorraine.


709
0:55:47,89 --> 0:55:50,19
QUESTION: How you doing?
ROMNEY: Good, thanks.


710
0:55:50,19 --> 0:55:54,65
QUESTION: Mr. Romney, what do you plan on
doing with immigrants without their green


711
0:55:54,65 --> 0:55:58,91
cards that are currently living here as productive
members of society?


712
0:55:58,91 --> 0:56:4,18
ROMNEY: Thank you. Lorraine? Did I get that
right? Good. Thank you for your question.


713
0:56:4,18 --> 0:56:8,499
And let me step back and tell you what I would
like to do with our immigration policy broadly


714
0:56:8,499 --> 0:56:14,89
and include an answer to your question.
But first of all, this is a nation of immigrants.


715
0:56:14,89 --> 0:56:18,569
We welcome people coming to this country as
immigrants. My dad was born in Mexico of American


716
0:56:18,569 --> 0:56:23,68
parents; Ann’s dad was born in Wales and
is a first-generation American. We welcome


717
0:56:23,68 --> 0:56:27,9
legal immigrants into this country.
I want our legal system to work better. I


718
0:56:27,9 --> 0:56:31,72
want it to be streamlined. I want it to be
clearer. I don’t think you have to — shouldn’t


719
0:56:31,72 --> 0:56:36,99
have to hire a lawyer to figure out how to
get into this country legally. I also think


720
0:56:36,99 --> 0:56:40,499
that we should give visas to people — green
cards, rather, to people who graduate with


721
0:56:40,499 --> 0:56:45,319
skills that we need. People around the world
with accredited degrees in science and math


722
0:56:45,319 --> 0:56:50,319
get a green card stapled to their diploma,
come to the U.S. of A. We should make sure


723
0:56:50,319 --> 0:56:53,769
our legal system works.
Number two, we’re going to have to stop


724
0:56:53,769 --> 0:56:59,229
illegal immigration. There are 4 million people
who are waiting in line to get here legally.


725
0:56:59,229 --> 0:57:2,839
Those who’ve come here illegally take their
place. So I will not grant amnesty to those


726
0:57:2,839 --> 0:57:6,489
who have come here illegally.
What I will do is I’ll put in place an employment


727
0:57:6,489 --> 0:57:11,729
verification system and make sure that employers
that hire people who have come here illegally


728
0:57:11,729 --> 0:57:17,319
are sanctioned for doing so. I won’t put
in place magnets for people coming here illegally.


729
0:57:17,319 --> 0:57:21,519
So for instance, I would not give driver’s
licenses to those that have come here illegally


730
0:57:21,519 --> 0:57:26,93
as the president would.
The kids of those that came here illegally,


731
0:57:26,93 --> 0:57:31,29
those kids, I think, should have a pathway
to become a permanent resident of the United


732
0:57:31,29 --> 0:57:35,309
States and military service, for instance,
is one way they would have that kind of pathway


733
0:57:35,309 --> 0:57:39,519
to become a permanent resident.
ROMNEY: Now when the president ran for office,


734
0:57:39,519 --> 0:57:43,119
he said that he’d put in place, in his first
year, a piece of legislation — he’d file


735
0:57:43,119 --> 0:57:48,42
a bill in his first year that would reform
our — our immigration system, protect legal


736
0:57:48,42 --> 0:57:51,309
immigration, stop illegal immigration. He
didn’t do it.


737
0:57:51,309 --> 0:57:56,9
He had a Democrat House, a Democrat Senate,
super majority in both Houses. Why did he


738
0:57:56,9 --> 0:58:2,91
fail to even promote legislation that would
have provided an answer for those that want


739
0:58:2,91 --> 0:58:8,16
to come legally and for those that are here
illegally today? What’s a question I think


740
0:58:8,16 --> 0:58:10,17
the — the president will have a chance to
answer right now.


741
0:58:10,17 --> 0:58:18,109
OBAMA: Good, I look forward to it.
Was — Lorranna — Lorraine — we are a


742
0:58:18,109 --> 0:58:23,67
nation of immigrants. I mean we’re just
a few miles away from Ellis Island. We all


743
0:58:23,67 --> 0:58:30,91
understand what this country has become because
talent from all around the world wants to


744
0:58:30,91 --> 0:58:36,4
come here. People are willing to take risks.
People who want to build on their dreams and


745
0:58:36,4 --> 0:58:39,43
make sure their kids have an even bigger dreams
than they have.


746
0:58:39,43 --> 0:58:46,109
But we’re also a nation of laws. So what
I’ve said is we need to fix a broken immigration


747
0:58:46,109 --> 0:58:52,15
system and I’ve done everything that I can
on my own and sought cooperation from Congress


748
0:58:52,15 --> 0:58:57,19
to make sure that we fix the system.
The first thing we did was to streamline the


749
0:58:57,19 --> 0:59:2,549
legal immigration system, to reduce the backlog,
make it easier, simpler and cheaper for people


750
0:59:2,549 --> 0:59:7,44
who are waiting in line, obeying the law to
make sure that they can come here and contribute


751
0:59:7,44 --> 0:59:10,739
to our country and that’s good for our economic
growth.


752
0:59:10,739 --> 0:59:15,109
They’ll start new businesses. They’ll
make things happen to create jobs here in


753
0:59:15,109 --> 0:59:19,22
the United States.
Number two, we do have to deal with our border


754
0:59:19,22 --> 0:59:24,67
so we put more border patrol on the — any
time in history and the flow of undocumented


755
0:59:24,67 --> 0:59:29,21
works across the border is actually lower
than it’s been in 40 years.


756
0:59:29,21 --> 0:59:34,519
What I’ve also said is if we’re going
to go after folks who are here illegally,


757
0:59:34,519 --> 0:59:39,619
we should do it smartly and go after folks
who are criminals, gang bangers, people who


758
0:59:39,619 --> 0:59:45,489
are hurting the community, not after students,
not after folks who are here just because


759
0:59:45,489 --> 0:59:48,93
they’re trying to figure out how to feed
their families. And that’s what we’ve


760
0:59:48,93 --> 0:59:54,96
done. And what I’ve also said is for young
people who come here, brought here often times


761
0:59:54,96 --> 1:0:2,69
by their parents. Had gone to school here,
pledged allegiance to the flag. Think of this


762
1:0:2,69 --> 1:0:7,559
as their country. Understand themselves as
Americans in every way except having papers.


763
1:0:7,559 --> 1:0:10,94
And we should make sure that we give them
a pathway to citizenship.


764
1:0:10,94 --> 1:0:16,529
And that’s what I’ve done administratively.
Now, Governor Romney just said, you know he


765
1:0:16,529 --> 1:0:20,779
wants to help those young people too, but
during the Republican primary, he said, “I


766
1:0:20,779 --> 1:0:27,71
will veto the DREAM Act”, that would allow
these young people to have access.” His


767
1:0:27,71 --> 1:0:32,2
main strategy during the Republican primary
was to say, “We’re going to encourage


768
1:0:32,2 --> 1:0:39,349
self-deportation.” Making life so miserable
on folks that they’ll leave. He called the


769
1:0:39,349 --> 1:0:43,739
Arizona law a model for the nation. Part of
the Arizona law said that law enforcement


770
1:0:43,739 --> 1:0:48,19
officers could stop folks because they suspected
maybe they looked like they might be undocumented


771
1:0:48,19 --> 1:0:58,289
workers and check their papers.
You know what? If my daughter or yours looks


772
1:0:58,289 --> 1:1:4,47
to somebody like they’re not a citizen,
I don’t want — I don’t want to empower


773
1:1:4,47 --> 1:1:12,999
somebody like that. So, we can fix this system
in a comprehensive way. And when Governor


774
1:1:12,999 --> 1:1:18,96
Romney says, the challenge is, “Well Obama
didn’t try.” That’s not true. I have


775
1:1:18,96 --> 1:1:23,4
sat down with Democrats and Republicans at
the beginning of my term. And I said, let’s


776
1:1:23,4 --> 1:1:28,239
fix this system. Including Senators previously
who had supported it on the Republican side.


777
1:1:28,239 --> 1:1:33,239
But it’s very hard for Republican’s in
Congress to support comprehensive immigration


778
1:1:33,239 --> 1:1:39,359
reform, if their standard bearer has said
that, this is not something I’m interested


779
1:1:39,359 --> 1:1:40,97
in supporting.
CROWLEY: Let me get the governor in here,


780
1:1:40,97 --> 1:1:44,99
Mr. President. Let’s speak to, if you could…
ROMNEY: Yes.


781
1:1:44,99 --> 1:1:47,239
CROWLEY: …the idea of self-deportation?
ROMNEY: No, let — let — let me go back


782
1:1:47,239 --> 1:1:51,29
and speak to the points that the president
made and — and — and let’s get them


783
1:1:51,29 --> 1:1:54,89
correct.
I did not say that the Arizona law was a model


784
1:1:54,89 --> 1:2:0,29
for the nation in that aspect. I said that
the E-Verify portion of the Arizona law, which


785
1:2:0,29 --> 1:2:4,519
is — which is the portion of the law which
says that employers could be able to determine


786
1:2:4,519 --> 1:2:8,249
whether someone is here illegally or not illegally,
that that was a model for the nation. That’s


787
1:2:8,249 --> 1:2:11,18
number one.
Number two, I asked the president a question


788
1:2:11,18 --> 1:2:15,71
I think Hispanics and immigrants all over
the nation have asked. He was asked this on


789
1:2:15,71 --> 1:2:20,21
Univision the other day. Why, when you said
you’d filed legislation in your first year


790
1:2:20,21 --> 1:2:24,21
didn’t you do it? And he didn’t answer.
He — he doesn’t answer that question.


791
1:2:24,21 --> 1:2:27,969
He said the standard bearer wasn’t for it.
I’m glad you thought I was a standard bearer


792
1:2:27,969 --> 1:2:33,16
four years ago, but I wasn’t.
Four years ago you said in your first year


793
1:2:33,16 --> 1:2:37,66
you would file legislation.
In his first year, I was just getting — licking


794
1:2:37,66 --> 1:2:41,18
my wounds from having been beaten by John
McCain, all right. I was not the standard


795
1:2:41,18 --> 1:2:44,13
bearer.
My — my view is that this president should


796
1:2:44,13 --> 1:2:48,599
have honored his promise to do as he said.
Now, let me mention one other thing, and that


797
1:2:48,599 --> 1:2:53,269
is self-deportation says let people make their
own choice. What I was saying is, we’re


798
1:2:53,269 --> 1:2:59,119
not going to round up 12 million people, undocumented
illegals, and take them out of the nation.


799
1:2:59,119 --> 1:3:3,17
Instead let people make their own choice.
And if they — if they find that — that


800
1:3:3,17 --> 1:3:6,509
they can’t get the benefits here that they
want and they can’t — and they can’t


801
1:3:6,509 --> 1:3:9,63
find the job they want, then they’ll make
a decision to go a place where — where they


802
1:3:9,63 --> 1:3:12,989
have better opportunities.
But I’m not in favor of rounding up people


803
1:3:12,989 --> 1:3:17,65
and — and — and taking them out of this
country. I am in favor, as the president has


804
1:3:17,65 --> 1:3:21,39
said, and I agree with him, which is that
if people have committed crimes we got to


805
1:3:21,39 --> 1:3:23,519
get them out of this country.
ROMNEY: Let me mention something else the


806
1:3:23,519 --> 1:3:27,67
president said. It was a moment ago and I
didn’t get a chance to, when he was describing


807
1:3:27,67 --> 1:3:31,809
Chinese investments and so forth.
OBAMA: Candy?


808
1:3:31,809 --> 1:3:36,17
Hold on a second. The…
ROMNEY: Mr. President, I’m still speaking.


809
1:3:36,17 --> 1:3:38,9
(CROSSTALK)
ROMNEY: Mr. President, let me finish.


810
1:3:38,9 --> 1:3:39,19
(CROSSTALK)
ROMNEY: I’ve gotta continue.


811
1:3:39,19 --> 1:3:43,59
(CROSSTALK)
CROWLEY: Governor Romney, you can make it


812
1:3:43,59 --> 1:3:45,789
short. See all these people? They’ve been
waiting for you. (inaudible) make it short


813
1:3:45,789 --> 1:3:47,65
(inaudible).
ROMNEY: Just going to make a point. Any investments


814
1:3:47,65 --> 1:3:51,989
I have over the last eight years have been
managed by a blind trust. And I understand


815
1:3:51,989 --> 1:3:56,729
they do include investments outside the United
States, including in — in Chinese companies.


816
1:3:56,729 --> 1:3:59,559
Mr. President, have you looked at your pension?
Have you looked at your pension?


817
1:3:59,559 --> 1:4:2,219
OBAMA: I’ve got to say…
ROMNEY: Mr. President, have you looked at


818
1:4:2,219 --> 1:4:4,739
your pension?
OBAMA: You know, I — I don’t look at my


819
1:4:4,739 --> 1:4:6,859
pension. It’s not as big as yours so it
doesn’t take as long.


820
1:4:6,859 --> 1:4:9,88
ROMNEY: Well, let me give you some advice.
OBAMA: I don’t check it that often.


821
1:4:9,88 --> 1:4:12,92
ROMNEY: Let me give you some advice. Look
at your pension. You also have investments


822
1:4:12,92 --> 1:4:17,109
in Chinese companies. You also have investments
outside the United States. You also have investments


823
1:4:17,109 --> 1:4:18,66
through a Cayman’s trust.
(CROSSTALK)


824
1:4:18,66 --> 1:4:20,979
CROWLEY: We’re way off topic here, Governor
Romney.


825
1:4:20,979 --> 1:4:24,299
(CROSSTALK)
OBAMA: I thought we were talking about immigration.


826
1:4:24,299 --> 1:4:27,799
(CROSSTALK)
OBAMA: I do want to make sure that…


827
1:4:27,799 --> 1:4:29,799
CROWLEY: If I could have you sit down, Governor
Romney. Thank you.


828
1:4:29,799 --> 1:4:31,979
OBAMA: I do want to make sure that — I do
want to make sure that we just understand


829
1:4:31,979 --> 1:4:36,91
something. Governor Romney says he wasn’t
referring to Arizona as a model for the nation.


830
1:4:36,91 --> 1:4:41,99
His top adviser on immigration is the guy
who designed the Arizona law, the entirety


831
1:4:41,99 --> 1:4:47,96
of it; not E-Verify, the whole thing. That’s
his policy. And it’s a bad policy. And it


832
1:4:47,96 --> 1:4:54,19
won’t help us grow.
Look, when we think about immigration, we


833
1:4:54,19 --> 1:5:0,99
have to understand there are folks all around
the world who still see America as the land


834
1:5:0,99 --> 1:5:6,539
of promise. And they provide us energy and
they provide us innovation and they start


835
1:5:6,539 --> 1:5:10,299
companies like Intel and Google. And we want
to encourage that.


836
1:5:10,299 --> 1:5:15,269
Now, we’ve got to make sure that we do it
in a smart way and a comprehensive way, and


837
1:5:15,269 --> 1:5:23,339
we make the legal system better. But when
we make this into a divisive political issue,


838
1:5:23,339 --> 1:5:27,38
and when we don’t have bipartisan support
— I can deliver, Governor, a whole bunch


839
1:5:27,38 --> 1:5:29,95
of Democrats to get comprehensive immigration
reform done, and we can’t…


840
1:5:29,95 --> 1:5:32,39
ROMNEY: I’ll get it done. I’ll get it
done. First year…


841
1:5:32,39 --> 1:5:37,9
OBAMA: … we can’t — we have not seen
Republicans serious about this issue at all.


842
1:5:37,9 --> 1:5:38,4
And it’s time for them to get serious on
it.


843
1:5:38,4 --> 1:5:38,829
CROWLEY: Mr. President, let me move you on
here please. Mr. President, (inaudible).


844
1:5:38,829 --> 1:5:39,729
OBAMA: This used to be a bipartisan issue.
(CROSSTALK)


845
1:5:39,729 --> 1:5:42,789
CROWLEY: Don’t go away, though — right.
Don’t go away because I — I want you to


846
1:5:42,789 --> 1:5:46,299
talk to Kerry Ladka who wants to switch the
topic for us.


847
1:5:46,299 --> 1:5:47,989
OBAMA: OK.
Hi, Kerry.


848
1:5:47,989 --> 1:5:52,63
QUESTION: Good evening, Mr. President.
OBAMA: I’m sorry. What’s your name?


849
1:5:52,63 --> 1:5:56,599
QUESTION: It’s Kerry, Kerry Ladka.
OBAMA: Great to see you.


850
1:5:56,599 --> 1:6:2,349
QUESTION: This question actually comes from
a brain trust of my friends at Global Telecom


851
1:6:2,349 --> 1:6:4,9
Supply (ph) in Minneola yesterday.
OBAMA: Ah.


852
1:6:4,9 --> 1:6:8,16
QUESTION: We were sitting around, talking
about Libya, and we were reading and became


853
1:6:8,16 --> 1:6:14,759
aware of reports that the State Department
refused extra security for our embassy in


854
1:6:14,759 --> 1:6:20,499
Benghazi, Libya, prior to the attacks that
killed four Americans.


855
1:6:20,499 --> 1:6:24,2
Who was it that denied enhanced security and
why?


856
1:6:24,2 --> 1:6:30,21
OBAMA: Well, let me first of all talk about
our diplomats, because they serve all around


857
1:6:30,21 --> 1:6:36,869
the world and do an incredible job in a very
dangerous situation. And these aren’t just


858
1:6:36,869 --> 1:6:41,589
representatives of the United States, they
are my representatives. I send them there,


859
1:6:41,589 --> 1:6:47,479
oftentimes into harm’s way. I know these
folks and I know their families. So nobody


860
1:6:47,479 --> 1:6:50,729
is more concerned about their safety and security
than I am.


861
1:6:50,729 --> 1:6:56,229
So as soon as we found out that the Benghazi
consulate was being overrun, I was on the


862
1:6:56,229 --> 1:6:59,9
phone with my national security team and I
gave them three instructions.


863
1:6:59,9 --> 1:7:7,66
Number one, beef up our security and procedures,
not just in Libya, but at every embassy and


864
1:7:7,66 --> 1:7:13,239
consulate in the region.
Number two, investigate exactly what happened,


865
1:7:13,239 --> 1:7:18,64
regardless of where the facts lead us, to
make sure folks are held accountable and it


866
1:7:18,64 --> 1:7:23,46
doesn’t happen again.
And number three, we are going to find out


867
1:7:23,46 --> 1:7:26,829
who did this and we’re going to hunt them
down, because one of the things that I’ve


868
1:7:26,829 --> 1:7:32,729
said throughout my presidency is when folks
mess with Americans, we go after them.


869
1:7:32,729 --> 1:7:38,94
OBAMA: Now Governor Romney had a very different
response. While we were still dealing with


870
1:7:38,94 --> 1:7:46,59
our diplomats being threatened, Governor Romney
put out a press release, trying to make political


871
1:7:46,59 --> 1:7:53,91
points, and that’s not how a commander in
chief operates. You don’t turn national


872
1:7:53,91 --> 1:8:0,69
security into a political issue. Certainly
not right when it’s happening. And people


873
1:8:0,69 --> 1:8:3,989
— not everybody agrees with some of the
decisions I’ve made. But when it comes to


874
1:8:3,989 --> 1:8:9,549
our national security, I mean what I say.
I said I’d end the war in Libya — in — in


875
1:8:9,549 --> 1:8:14,359
Iraq, and I did.
I said that we’d go after al-Qaeda and bin


876
1:8:14,359 --> 1:8:20,41
Laden, we have. I said we’d transition out
of Afghanistan, and start making sure that


877
1:8:20,41 --> 1:8:25,29
Afghans are responsible for their own security,
that’s what I’m doing. And when it comes


878
1:8:25,29 --> 1:8:30,839
to this issue, when I say that we are going
to find out exactly what happened, everybody


879
1:8:30,839 --> 1:8:36,68
will be held accountable. And I am ultimately
responsible for what’s taking place there


880
1:8:36,68 --> 1:8:41,25
because these are my folks, and I’m the
one who has to greet those coffins when they


881
1:8:41,25 --> 1:8:46,19
come home. You know that I mean what I say.
CROWLEY: Mr. President, I’m going to move


882
1:8:46,19 --> 1:8:50,56
us along. Governor?
ROMNEY: Thank you Kerry for your question,


883
1:8:50,56 --> 1:8:55,6
it’s an important one. And — and I — I
think the president just said correctly that


884
1:8:55,6 --> 1:9:1,12
the buck does stop at his desk and — and
he takes responsibility for — for that — for


885
1:9:1,12 --> 1:9:6,2
the failure in providing those security resources,
and — and those terrible things may well


886
1:9:6,2 --> 1:9:10,52
happen from time to time. I — I’m — I
feel very deeply sympathetic for the families


887
1:9:10,52 --> 1:9:14,82
of those who lost loved ones. And today there’s
a memorial service for one of those that was


888
1:9:14,82 --> 1:9:19,83
lost in this tragedy. We — we think of their
families and care for them deeply. There were


889
1:9:19,83 --> 1:9:26,6
other issues associated with this — with
this tragedy. There were many days that passed


890
1:9:26,6 --> 1:9:30,4
before we knew whether this was a spontaneous
demonstration, or actually whether it was


891
1:9:30,4 --> 1:9:32,87
a terrorist attack.
ROMNEY: And there was no demonstration involved.


892
1:9:32,87 --> 1:9:39,75
It was a terrorist attack and it took a long
time for that to be told to the American people.


893
1:9:39,75 --> 1:9:43,3
Whether there was some misleading, or instead
whether we just didn’t know what happened,


894
1:9:43,3 --> 1:9:48,31
you have to ask yourself why didn’t we know
five days later when the ambassador to the


895
1:9:48,31 --> 1:9:52,359
United Nations went on TV to say that this
was a demonstration. How could we have not


896
1:9:52,359 --> 1:9:55,0
known?
But I find more troubling than this, that


897
1:9:55,0 --> 1:9:59,8
on — on the day following the assassination
of the United States ambassador, the first


898
1:9:59,8 --> 1:10:6,35
time that’s happened since 1979, when — when
we have four Americans killed there, when


899
1:10:6,35 --> 1:10:11,32
apparently we didn’t know what happened,
that the president, the day after that happened,


900
1:10:11,32 --> 1:10:15,54
flies to Las Vegas for a political fund-raiser,
then the next day to Colorado for another


901
1:10:15,54 --> 1:10:20,44
event, other political event.
I think these — these actions taken by a


902
1:10:20,44 --> 1:10:26,66
president and a leader have symbolic significance
and perhaps even material significance in


903
1:10:26,66 --> 1:10:30,29
that you’d hope that during that time we
could call in the people who were actually


904
1:10:30,29 --> 1:10:34,6
eyewitnesses. We’ve read their accounts
now about what happened. It was very clear


905
1:10:34,6 --> 1:10:38,98
this was not a demonstration. This was an
attack by terrorists.


906
1:10:38,98 --> 1:10:42,94
And this calls into question the president’s
whole policy in the Middle East. Look what’s


907
1:10:42,94 --> 1:10:49,5
happening in Syria, in Egypt, now in Libya.
Consider the distance between ourselves and


908
1:10:49,5 --> 1:10:53,5
— and Israel, the president said that — that
he was going to put daylight between us and


909
1:10:53,5 --> 1:10:56,69
Israel.
We have Iran four years closer to a nuclear


910
1:10:56,69 --> 1:11:3,4
bomb. Syria — Syria’s not just a tragedy
of 30,000 civilians being killed by a military,


911
1:11:3,4 --> 1:11:7,85
but also a strategic — strategically significant
player for America.


912
1:11:7,85 --> 1:11:12,19
The president’s policies throughout the
Middle East began with an apology tour and


913
1:11:12,19 --> 1:11:16,75
— and — and pursue a strategy of leading
from behind, and this strategy is unraveling


914
1:11:16,75 --> 1:11:21,8
before our very eyes.
CROWLEY: Because we’re — we’re closing


915
1:11:21,8 --> 1:11:24,19
in, I want to still get a lot of people in.
I want to ask you something, Mr. President,


916
1:11:24,19 --> 1:11:28,39
and then have the governor just quickly.
Your secretary of state, as I’m sure you


917
1:11:28,39 --> 1:11:34,26
know, has said that she takes full responsibility
for the attack on the diplomatic mission in


918
1:11:34,26 --> 1:11:38,75
Benghazi. Does the buck stop with your secretary
of state as far as what went on here?


919
1:11:38,75 --> 1:11:44,69
OBAMA: Secretary Clinton has done an extraordinary
job. But she works for me. I’m the president


920
1:11:44,69 --> 1:11:49,26
and I’m always responsible, and that’s
why nobody’s more interested in finding


921
1:11:49,26 --> 1:11:57,29
out exactly what happened than I do.
The day after the attack, governor, I stood


922
1:11:57,29 --> 1:12:2,72
in the Rose Garden and I told the American
people in the world that we are going to find


923
1:12:2,72 --> 1:12:9,3
out exactly what happened. That this was an
act of terror and I also said that we’re


924
1:12:9,3 --> 1:12:13,23
going to hunt down those who committed this
crime.


925
1:12:13,23 --> 1:12:18,59
And then a few days later, I was there greeting
the caskets coming into Andrews Air Force


926
1:12:18,59 --> 1:12:27,32
Base and grieving with the families.
And the suggestion that anybody in my team,


927
1:12:27,32 --> 1:12:36,6
whether the Secretary of State, our U.N. Ambassador,
anybody on my team would play politics or


928
1:12:36,6 --> 1:12:42,77
mislead when we’ve lost four of our own,
governor, is offensive. That’s not what


929
1:12:42,77 --> 1:12:49,87
we do. That’s not what I do as president,
that’s not what I do as Commander in Chief.


930
1:12:49,87 --> 1:12:53,64
CROWLEY: Governor, if you want to…
ROMNEY: Yes, I — I…


931
1:12:53,64 --> 1:12:56,33
CROWLEY: … quickly to this please.
ROMNEY: I — I think interesting the president


932
1:12:56,33 --> 1:12:59,96
just said something which — which is that
on the day after the attack he went into the


933
1:12:59,96 --> 1:13:2,94
Rose Garden and said that this was an act
of terror.


934
1:13:2,94 --> 1:13:6,79
OBAMA: That’s what I said.
ROMNEY: You said in the Rose Garden the day


935
1:13:6,79 --> 1:13:13,0
after the attack, it was an act of terror.
It was not a spontaneous demonstration, is


936
1:13:13,0 --> 1:13:15,64
that what you’re saying?
OBAMA: Please proceed governor.


937
1:13:15,64 --> 1:13:20,17
ROMNEY: I want to make sure we get that for
the record because it took the president 14


938
1:13:20,17 --> 1:13:23,15
days before he called the attack in Benghazi
an act of terror.


939
1:13:23,15 --> 1:13:25,77
OBAMA: Get the transcript.
CROWLEY: It — it — it — he did in fact,


940
1:13:25,77 --> 1:13:27,92
sir. So let me — let me call it an act of
terror…


941
1:13:27,92 --> 1:13:32,83
OBAMA: Can you say that a little louder, Candy?
CROWLEY: He — he did call it an act of terror.


942
1:13:32,83 --> 1:13:40,62
It did as well take — it did as well take
two weeks or so for the whole idea there being


943
1:13:40,62 --> 1:13:44,2
a riot out there about this tape to come out.
You are correct about that.


944
1:13:44,2 --> 1:13:49,67
ROMNEY: This — the administration — the
administration indicated this was a reaction


945
1:13:49,67 --> 1:13:52,96
to a video and was a spontaneous reaction.
CROWLEY: It did.


946
1:13:52,96 --> 1:13:57,2
ROMNEY: It took them a long time to say this
was a terrorist act by a terrorist group.


947
1:13:57,2 --> 1:14:4,19
And to suggest — am I incorrect in that
regard, on Sunday, the — your secretary


948
1:14:4,19 --> 1:14:4,56
–
OBAMA: Candy?


949
1:14:4,56 --> 1:14:9,42
ROMNEY: Excuse me. The ambassador of the United
Nations went on the Sunday television shows


950
1:14:9,42 --> 1:14:10,29
and spoke about how –
OBAMA: Candy, I’m –


951
1:14:10,29 --> 1:14:11,62
ROMNEY: — this was a spontaneous –
CROWLEY: Mr. President, let me –


952
1:14:11,62 --> 1:14:13,48
OBAMA: I’m happy to have a longer conversation
–


953
1:14:13,48 --> 1:14:14,24
CROWLEY: I know you –
OBAMA: — about foreign policy.


954
1:14:14,24 --> 1:14:16,25
CROWLEY: Absolutely. But I want to — I want
to move you on and also –


955
1:14:16,25 --> 1:14:18,25
OBAMA: OK. I’m happy to do that, too.
CROWLEY: — the transcripts and –


956
1:14:18,25 --> 1:14:21,81
OBAMA: I just want to make sure that –
CROWLEY: — figure out what we –


957
1:14:21,81 --> 1:14:23,52
OBAMA: — all of these wonderful folks are
going to have a chance to get some of their


958
1:14:23,52 --> 1:14:25,13
questions answered.
CROWLEY: Because what I — what I want to


959
1:14:25,13 --> 1:14:29,37
do, Mr. President, stand there a second, because
I want to introduce you to Nina Gonzalez,


960
1:14:29,37 --> 1:14:36,69
who brought up a question that we hear a lot,
both over the Internet and from this crowd.


961
1:14:36,69 --> 1:14:43,92
QUESTION: President Obama, during the Democratic
National Convention in 2008, you stated you


962
1:14:43,92 --> 1:14:50,73
wanted to keep AK-47s out of the hands of
criminals. What has your administration done


963
1:14:50,73 --> 1:14:55,0
or planned to do to limit the availability
of assault weapons?


964
1:14:55,0 --> 1:15:0,17
OBAMA: We’re a nation that believes in the
Second Amendment, and I believe in the Second


965
1:15:0,17 --> 1:15:7,96
Amendment. We’ve got a long tradition of
hunting and sportsmen and people who want


966
1:15:7,96 --> 1:15:13,77
to make sure they can protect themselves.
But there have been too many instances during


967
1:15:13,77 --> 1:15:19,6
the course of my presidency, where I’ve
had to comfort families who have lost somebody.


968
1:15:19,6 --> 1:15:25,97
Most recently out in Aurora. You know, just
a couple of weeks ago, actually, probably


969
1:15:25,97 --> 1:15:34,24
about a month, I saw a mother, who I had met
at the bedside of her son, who had been shot


970
1:15:34,24 --> 1:15:40,17
in that theater.
And her son had been shot through the head.


971
1:15:40,17 --> 1:15:48,44
And we spent some time, and we said a prayer
and, remarkably, about two months later, this


972
1:15:48,44 --> 1:15:56,87
young man and his mom showed up, and he looked
unbelievable, good as new.


973
1:15:56,87 --> 1:16:2,81
But there were a lot of families who didn’t
have that good fortune and whose sons or daughters


974
1:16:2,81 --> 1:16:8,63
or husbands didn’t survive.
So my belief is that, (A), we have to enforce


975
1:16:8,63 --> 1:16:13,73
the laws we’ve already got, make sure that
we’re keeping guns out of the hands of criminals,


976
1:16:13,73 --> 1:16:19,36
those who are mentally ill. We’ve done a
much better job in terms of background checks,


977
1:16:19,36 --> 1:16:22,94
but we’ve got more to do when it comes to
enforcement.


978
1:16:22,94 --> 1:16:29,35
But I also share your belief that weapons
that were designed for soldiers in war theaters


979
1:16:29,35 --> 1:16:35,92
don’t belong on our streets. And so what
I’m trying to do is to get a broader conversation


980
1:16:35,92 --> 1:16:44,44
about how do we reduce the violence generally.
Part of it is seeing if we can get an assault


981
1:16:44,44 --> 1:16:50,3
weapons ban reintroduced. But part of it is
also looking at other sources of the violence.


982
1:16:50,3 --> 1:16:52,81
Because frankly, in my home town of Chicago,
there’s an awful lot of violence and they’re


983
1:16:52,81 --> 1:16:56,27
not using AK-47s. They’re using cheap hand
guns.


984
1:16:56,27 --> 1:17:1,94
And so what can we do to intervene, to make
sure that young people have opportunity; that


985
1:17:1,94 --> 1:17:7,39
our schools are working; that if there’s
violence on the streets, that working with


986
1:17:7,39 --> 1:17:11,82
faith groups and law enforcement, we can catch
it before it gets out of control.


987
1:17:11,82 --> 1:17:18,33
And so what I want is a — is a comprehensive
strategy. Part of it is seeing if we can get


988
1:17:18,33 --> 1:17:25,35
automatic weapons that kill folks in amazing
numbers out of the hands of criminals and


989
1:17:25,35 --> 1:17:29,71
the mentally ill. But part of it is also going
deeper and seeing if we can get into these


990
1:17:29,71 --> 1:17:34,19
communities and making sure we catch violent
impulses before they occur.


991
1:17:34,19 --> 1:17:37,5
CROWLEY: Governor Romney, the question is
about assault weapons, AK-47s.


992
1:17:37,5 --> 1:17:43,64
ROMNEY: Yeah, I’m not in favor of new pieces
of legislation on — on guns and taking guns


993
1:17:43,64 --> 1:17:47,77
away or making certain guns illegal. We, of
course, don’t want to have automatic weapons,


994
1:17:47,77 --> 1:17:52,4
and that’s already illegal in this country
to have automatic weapons. What I believe


995
1:17:52,4 --> 1:17:55,85
is we have to do, as the president mentioned
towards the end of his remarks there, which


996
1:17:55,85 --> 1:18:2,2
is to make enormous efforts to enforce the
gun laws that we have, and to change the culture


997
1:18:2,2 --> 1:18:4,94
of violence that we have.
And you ask how — how are we going to do


998
1:18:4,94 --> 1:18:8,84
that? And there are a number of things. He
mentioned good schools. I totally agree. We


999
1:18:8,84 --> 1:18:13,21
were able to drive our schools to be number
one in the nation in my state. And I believe


1000
1:18:13,21 --> 1:18:16,91
if we do a better job in education, we’ll
— we’ll give people the — the hope and


1001
1:18:16,91 --> 1:18:20,25
opportunity they deserve and perhaps less
violence from that. But let me mention another


1002
1:18:20,25 --> 1:18:26,45
thing. And that is parents. We need moms and
dads, helping to raise kids. Wherever possible


1003
1:18:26,45 --> 1:18:29,8
the — the benefit of having two parents
in the home, and that’s not always possible.


1004
1:18:29,8 --> 1:18:34,96
A lot of great single moms, single dads. But
gosh to tell our kids that before they have


1005
1:18:34,96 --> 1:18:39,21
babies, they ought to think about getting
married to someone, that’s a great idea.


1006
1:18:39,21 --> 1:18:43,27
Because if there’s a two parent family,
the prospect of living in poverty goes down


1007
1:18:43,27 --> 1:18:48,25
dramatically. The opportunities that the child
will — will be able to achieve increase


1008
1:18:48,25 --> 1:18:53,56
dramatically. So we can make changes in the
way our culture works to help bring people


1009
1:18:53,56 --> 1:18:58,23
away from violence and give them opportunity,
and bring them in the American system. The


1010
1:18:58,23 --> 1:19:1,79
— the greatest failure we’ve had with
regards to — to gun violence in some respects


1011
1:19:1,79 --> 1:19:8,45
is what — what is known as Fast and Furious.
Which was a program under this administration,


1012
1:19:8,45 --> 1:19:14,37
and how it worked exactly I think we don’t
know precisely, where thousands of automatic,


1013
1:19:14,37 --> 1:19:19,21
and AK-47 type weapons were — were given
to people that ultimately gave them to — to


1014
1:19:19,21 --> 1:19:23,8
drug lords.
They used those weapons against — against


1015
1:19:23,8 --> 1:19:27,9
their own citizens and killed Americans with
them. And this was a — this was a program


1016
1:19:27,9 --> 1:19:32,31
of the government. For what purpose it was
put in place, I can’t imagine. But it’s


1017
1:19:32,31 --> 1:19:36,75
one of the great tragedies related to violence
in our society which has occurred during this


1018
1:19:36,75 --> 1:19:41,25
administration. Which I think the American
people would like to understand fully, it’s


1019
1:19:41,25 --> 1:19:47,63
been investigated to a degree, but — but
the administration has carried out executive


1020
1:19:47,63 --> 1:19:50,17
privilege to prevent all of the information
from coming out.


1021
1:19:50,17 --> 1:19:54,79
I’d like to understand who it was that did
this, what the idea was behind it, why it


1022
1:19:54,79 --> 1:19:59,68
led to the violence, thousands of guns going
to Mexican drug lords. OBAMA: Candy?


1023
1:19:59,68 --> 1:20:3,93
CROWLEY: Governor, Governor, if I could, the
question was about these assault weapons that


1024
1:20:3,93 --> 1:20:10,18
once were once banned and are no longer banned.
I know that you signed an assault weapons


1025
1:20:10,18 --> 1:20:14,86
ban when you were in Massachusetts, obviously,
with this question, you no longer do support


1026
1:20:14,86 --> 1:20:20,9
that. Why is that, given the kind of violence
that we see sometimes with these mass killings?


1027
1:20:20,9 --> 1:20:25,2
Why is it that you have changed your mind?
ROMNEY: Well, Candy, actually, in my state,


1028
1:20:25,2 --> 1:20:31,17
the pro-gun folks and the anti-gun folks came
together and put together a piece of legislation.


1029
1:20:31,17 --> 1:20:36,42
And it’s referred to as an assault weapon
ban, but it had, at the signing of the bill,


1030
1:20:36,42 --> 1:20:40,83
both the pro-gun and the anti-gun people came
together, because it provided opportunities


1031
1:20:40,83 --> 1:20:44,22
for both that both wanted.
There were hunting opportunities, for instance,


1032
1:20:44,22 --> 1:20:47,84
that haven’t previously been available and
so forth, so it was a mutually agreed- upon


1033
1:20:47,84 --> 1:20:52,41
piece of legislation. That’s what we need
more of, Candy. What we have right now in


1034
1:20:52,41 --> 1:20:56,68
Washington is a place that’s gridlocked.
CROWLEY: So I could — if you could get people


1035
1:20:56,68 --> 1:20:58,43
to agree to it, you would be for it?
ROMNEY: We have –


1036
1:20:58,43 --> 1:21:0,13
OBAMA: Candy?
ROMNEY: — we haven’t had the leadership


1037
1:21:0,13 --> 1:21:4,58
in Washington to work on a bipartisan basis.
I was able to do that in my state and bring


1038
1:21:4,58 --> 1:21:6,11
these two together.
CROWLEY: Quickly, Mr. President.


1039
1:21:6,11 --> 1:21:13,92
OBAMA: The — first of all, I think Governor
Romney was for an assault weapons ban before


1040
1:21:13,92 --> 1:21:20,12
he was against it. And he said that the reason
he changed his mind was, in part, because


1041
1:21:20,12 --> 1:21:27,1
he was seeking the endorsement of the National
Rifle Association. So that’s on the record.


1042
1:21:27,1 --> 1:21:32,22
But I think that one area we agree on is the
important of parents and the importance of


1043
1:21:32,22 --> 1:21:38,39
schools, because I do believe that if our
young people have opportunity, then they are


1044
1:21:38,39 --> 1:21:42,51
less likely to engage in these kinds of violent
acts. We’re not going to eliminate everybody


1045
1:21:42,51 --> 1:21:45,96
who is mentally disturbed and we have got
to make sure they don’t get weapons.


1046
1:21:45,96 --> 1:21:46,31
(AUDIO GAP)
OBAMA: because I do believe that if our young


1047
1:21:46,31 --> 1:21:46,6
people have opportunity, then they’re less
likely to engage in these kind of violent


1048
1:21:46,6 --> 1:21:46,77
acts.
We’re not going to eliminate everybody who


1049
1:21:46,77 --> 1:21:47,43
is mentally disturbed, and we’ve got to
make sure they don’t get weapons. But we


1050
1:21:47,43 --> 1:21:52,64
can make a difference in terms ensuring that
every young person in America, regardless


1051
1:21:52,64 --> 1:21:55,89
of where they come from, what they look like,
have a chance to succeed.


1052
1:21:55,89 --> 1:22:0,7
And, Candy, we haven’t had a chance to talk
about education much, but I think it is very


1053
1:22:0,7 --> 1:22:6,85
important to understand that the reforms we’ve
put in place, working with 46 governors around


1054
1:22:6,85 --> 1:22:13,46
the country, are seeing schools that are some
of the ones that are the toughest for kids


1055
1:22:13,46 --> 1:22:17,55
starting to succeed. We’re starting to see
gains in math and science.


1056
1:22:17,55 --> 1:22:24,1
When it comes to community colleges, we are
setting up programs, including with Nassau


1057
1:22:24,1 --> 1:22:28,89
Community College, to retrain workers, including
young people who may have dropped out of school


1058
1:22:28,89 --> 1:22:34,0
but now are getting another chance, training
them for the jobs that exist right now.


1059
1:22:34,0 --> 1:22:40,54
And in fact, employers are looking for skilled
workers. And so we’re matching them up.


1060
1:22:40,54 --> 1:22:45,4
Giving them access to higher education. As
I said, we have made sure that millions of


1061
1:22:45,4 --> 1:22:48,58
young people are able to get an education
that they weren’t able to get before.


1062
1:22:48,58 --> 1:22:50,58
Now…
CROWLEY: Mr. President, I have to — I have


1063
1:22:50,58 --> 1:22:52,4
to move you along here. You said you wanted
to…


1064
1:22:52,4 --> 1:22:53,52
(CROSSTALK)
CROWLEY: We need to do it here.


1065
1:22:53,52 --> 1:22:54,31
OBAMA: But — but it’ll — it’ll — it’ll
be…


1066
1:22:54,31 --> 1:22:55,17
(CROSSTALK)
OBAMA: … just one second.


1067
1:22:55,17 --> 1:22:57,17
CROWLEY: One…
OBAMA: Because — because this is important.


1068
1:22:57,17 --> 1:23:4,63
This is part of the choice in this election.
When Governor Romney was asked whether teachers,


1069
1:23:4,63 --> 1:23:9,28
hiring more teachers was important to growing
our economy, Governor Romney said that doesn’t


1070
1:23:9,28 --> 1:23:12,66
grow our economy.
When — when he was asked would class size…


1071
1:23:12,66 --> 1:23:14,33
(CROSSTALK)
CROWLEY: The question, Mr. President, was


1072
1:23:14,33 --> 1:23:16,5
guns here, so I need to move us along.
OBAMA: I understand.


1073
1:23:16,5 --> 1:23:17,91
CROWLEY: You know, the question was guns.
So let me — let me bring in another…


1074
1:23:17,91 --> 1:23:21,17
OBAMA: But this will make a difference in
terms of whether or not we can move this economy


1075
1:23:21,17 --> 1:23:22,75
forward for these young people…
CROWLEY: I understand.


1076
1:23:22,75 --> 1:23:25,23
OBAMA: … and reduce our violence.
CROWLEY: OK. Thank you so much.


1077
1:23:25,23 --> 1:23:29,91
I want to ask Carol Goldberg to stand up,
because she gets to a question that both these


1078
1:23:29,91 --> 1:23:32,27
men have been passionate about. It’s for
Governor Romney.


1079
1:23:32,27 --> 1:23:39,25
QUESTION: The outsourcing of American jobs
overseas has taken a toll on our economy.


1080
1:23:39,25 --> 1:23:43,31
What plans do you have to put back and keep
jobs here in the United States?


1081
1:23:43,31 --> 1:23:48,4
ROMNEY: Boy, great question and important
question, because you’re absolutely right.


1082
1:23:48,4 --> 1:23:52,51
The place where we’ve seen manufacturing
go has been China. China is now the largest


1083
1:23:52,51 --> 1:23:56,2
manufacturer in the world. It used to be the
United States of America. A lot of good people


1084
1:23:56,2 --> 1:24:1,0
have lost jobs. A half a million manufacturing
jobs have been lost in the last four years.


1085
1:24:1,0 --> 1:24:5,23
That’s total over the last four years.
One of the reasons for that is that people


1086
1:24:5,23 --> 1:24:9,93
think it’s more attractive in some cases
to go offshore than to stay here. We have


1087
1:24:9,93 --> 1:24:14,23
made it less attractive for enterprises to
stay here than to go offshore from time to


1088
1:24:14,23 --> 1:24:18,44
time. What I will do as president is make
sure it’s more attractive to come to America


1089
1:24:18,44 --> 1:24:21,64
again.
This is the way we’re going to create jobs


1090
1:24:21,64 --> 1:24:25,49
in this country. It’s not by trickle-down
government, saying we’re going to take more


1091
1:24:25,49 --> 1:24:31,49
money from people and hire more government
workers, raise more taxes, put in place more


1092
1:24:31,49 --> 1:24:35,95
regulations. Trickle-down government has never
worked here, has never worked anywhere.


1093
1:24:35,95 --> 1:24:40,5
I want to make America the most attractive
place in the world for entrepreneurs, for


1094
1:24:40,5 --> 1:24:45,4
small business, for big business, to invest
and grow in America.


1095
1:24:45,4 --> 1:24:49,92
Now, we’re going to have to make sure that
as we trade with other nations that they play


1096
1:24:49,92 --> 1:24:54,23
by the rules. And China hasn’t. One of the
reasons — or one of the ways they don’t


1097
1:24:54,23 --> 1:24:58,52
play by the rules is artificially holding
down the value of their currency. Because


1098
1:24:58,52 --> 1:25:3,15
if they put their currency down low, that
means their prices on their goods are low.


1099
1:25:3,15 --> 1:25:8,16
And that makes them advantageous in the marketplace.
We lose sales. And manufacturers here in the


1100
1:25:8,16 --> 1:25:13,34
U.S. making the same products can’t compete.
China has been a currency manipulator for


1101
1:25:13,34 --> 1:25:20,4
years and years and years. And the president
has a regular opportunity to label them as


1102
1:25:20,4 --> 1:25:22,59
a currency manipulator, but refuses to do
so.


1103
1:25:22,59 --> 1:25:29,85
On day one, I will label China a currency
manipulator, which will allow me as president


1104
1:25:29,85 --> 1:25:34,6
to be able to put in place, if necessary,
tariffs where I believe that they are taking


1105
1:25:34,6 --> 1:25:38,4
unfair advantage of our manufacturers.
So we’re going to make sure that people


1106
1:25:38,4 --> 1:25:43,69
we trade with around the world play by the
rules. But let me — let me not just stop


1107
1:25:43,69 --> 1:25:49,38
there. Don’t forget, what’s key to bringing
back jobs here is not just finding someone


1108
1:25:49,38 --> 1:25:53,37
else to punish, and I’m going to be strict
with people who we trade with to make sure


1109
1:25:53,37 --> 1:25:57,93
they — they follow the law and play by the
rules, but it’s also to make America the


1110
1:25:57,93 --> 1:26:1,3
most attractive place in the world for businesses
of all kinds.


1111
1:26:1,3 --> 1:26:6,61
That’s why I want to down the tax rates
on small employers, big employers, so they


1112
1:26:6,61 --> 1:26:13,96
want to be here. Canada’s tax rate on companies
is now 15 percent. Ours is 35 percent. So


1113
1:26:13,96 --> 1:26:18,37
if you’re starting a business, where would
you rather start it? We have to be competitive


1114
1:26:18,37 --> 1:26:23,8
if we’re going to create more jobs here.
Regulations have quadrupled. The rate of regulations


1115
1:26:23,8 --> 1:26:28,88
quadrupled under this president. I talk to
small businesses across the country. They


1116
1:26:28,88 --> 1:26:32,33
say, “We feel like we’re under attack
from our own government.” I want to make


1117
1:26:32,33 --> 1:26:37,28
sure that regulators see their job as encouraging
small business, not crushing it. And there’s


1118
1:26:37,28 --> 1:26:43,57
no question but that Obamacare has been an
extraordinary deterrent to enterprises of


1119
1:26:43,57 --> 1:26:47,7
all kinds hiring people.
My priority is making sure that we get more


1120
1:26:47,7 --> 1:26:53,95
people hired. If we have more people hired,
if we get back manufacturing jobs, if we get


1121
1:26:53,95 --> 1:26:58,5
back all kinds of jobs into this country,
then you’re going to see rising incomes


1122
1:26:58,5 --> 1:27:3,6
again. The reason incomes are down is because
unemployment is so high. I know what it takes


1123
1:27:3,6 --> 1:27:7,59
to get this to happen, and my plan will do
that, and one part of it is to make sure that


1124
1:27:7,59 --> 1:27:12,55
we keep China playing by the rules.
CROWLEY: Mr. President, two minutes here,


1125
1:27:12,55 --> 1:27:16,49
because we are then going to go to our last
question.


1126
1:27:16,49 --> 1:27:21,26
OBAMA: OK. We need to create jobs here. And
both Governor Romney and I agree actually


1127
1:27:21,26 --> 1:27:25,41
that we should lower our corporate tax rate.
It’s too high. But there’s a difference


1128
1:27:25,41 --> 1:27:32,71
in terms of how we would do it. I want to
close loopholes that allow companies to deduct


1129
1:27:32,71 --> 1:27:40,94
expenses when they move to China; that allow
them to profit offshore and not have to get


1130
1:27:40,94 --> 1:27:46,7
taxed, so they have tax advantages offshore.
All those changes in our tax code would make


1131
1:27:46,7 --> 1:27:50,9
a difference.
Now, Governor Romney actually wants to expand


1132
1:27:50,9 --> 1:27:55,49
those tax breaks. One of his big ideas when
it comes to corporate tax reform would be


1133
1:27:55,49 --> 1:28:2,88
to say, if you invest overseas, you make profits
overseas, you don’t have to pay U.S. taxes.


1134
1:28:2,88 --> 1:28:6,78
But, of course, if you’re a small business
or a mom-and-pop business or a big business


1135
1:28:6,78 --> 1:28:10,67
starting up here, you’ve got to pay even
the reduced rate that Governor Romney’s


1136
1:28:10,67 --> 1:28:13,78
talking about.
And it’s estimated that that will create


1137
1:28:13,78 --> 1:28:21,71
800,000 new jobs. The problem is they’ll
be in china. Or India. Or Germany.


1138
1:28:21,71 --> 1:28:24,99
That’s not the way we’re going to create
jobs here. The way we’re going to create


1139
1:28:24,99 --> 1:28:30,23
jobs here is not just to change our tax code,
but also to double our exports. And we are


1140
1:28:30,23 --> 1:28:34,46
on pace to double our exports, one of the
commitments I made when I was president. That’s


1141
1:28:34,46 --> 1:28:40,2
creating tens of thousands of jobs all across
the country. That’s why we’ve kept on


1142
1:28:40,2 --> 1:28:44,78
pushing trade deals, but trade deals that
make sure that American workers and American


1143
1:28:44,78 --> 1:28:49,44
businesses are getting a good deal.
Now, Governor Romney talked about China, as


1144
1:28:49,44 --> 1:28:55,88
I already indicated. In the private sector,
Governor Romney’s company invested in what


1145
1:28:55,88 --> 1:29:1,4
were called pioneers of outsourcing. That’s
not my phrase. That’s what reporters called


1146
1:29:1,4 --> 1:29:6,15
it.
And as far as currency manipulation, the currency


1147
1:29:6,15 --> 1:29:10,49
has actually gone up 11 percent since I’ve
been president because we have pushed them


1148
1:29:10,49 --> 1:29:17,36
hard. And we’ve put unprecedented trade
pressure on China. That’s why exports have


1149
1:29:17,36 --> 1:29:21,82
significantly increased under my presidency.
That’s going to help to create jobs here.


1150
1:29:21,82 --> 1:29:26,91
CROWLEY: Mr. President, we have a really short
time for a quick discussion here.


1151
1:29:26,91 --> 1:29:33,3
iPad, the Macs, the iPhones, they are all
manufactured in China. One of the major reasons


1152
1:29:33,3 --> 1:29:38,84
is labor is so much cheaper here. How do you
convince a great American company to bring


1153
1:29:38,84 --> 1:29:45,2
that manufacturing back here?
ROMNEY: The answer is very straightforward.


1154
1:29:45,2 --> 1:29:49,89
We can compete with anyone in the world as
long as the playing field is level. China’s


1155
1:29:49,89 --> 1:29:54,37
been cheating over the years. One by holding
down the value of their currency. Number two,


1156
1:29:54,37 --> 1:29:58,1
by stealing our intellectual property; our
designs, our patents, our technology. There’s


1157
1:29:58,1 --> 1:30:3,39
even an Apple store in China that’s a counterfeit
Apple store, selling counterfeit goods. They


1158
1:30:3,39 --> 1:30:7,63
hack into our computers. We will have to have
people play on a fair basis, that’s number


1159
1:30:7,63 --> 1:30:11,37
one.
Number two, we have to make America the most


1160
1:30:11,37 --> 1:30:15,9
attractive place for entrepreneurs, for people
who want to expand their business. That’s


1161
1:30:15,9 --> 1:30:19,45
what brings jobs in. The president’s characterization
of my tax plan…


1162
1:30:19,45 --> 1:30:21,2
(CROSSTALK)
ROMNEY: …is completely…is completely…


1163
1:30:21,2 --> 1:30:22,83
(CROSSTALK)
ROMNEY: …is completely false. Let me tell


1164
1:30:22,83 --> 1:30:24,48
you…
CROWLEY: Let me to go the president here because


1165
1:30:24,48 --> 1:30:28,17
we really are running out of time. And the
question is can we ever get — we can’t


1166
1:30:28,17 --> 1:30:31,1
get wages like that. It can’t be sustained.
OBAMA: Candy, there are some jobs that are


1167
1:30:31,1 --> 1:30:38,46
not going to come back. Because they are low
wage, low skill jobs. I want high wage, high


1168
1:30:38,46 --> 1:30:43,42
skill jobs. That’s why we have to emphasize
manufacturing. That’s why we have to invest


1169
1:30:43,42 --> 1:30:47,32
in advanced manufacturing. That’s why we’ve
got to make sure that we’ve got the best


1170
1:30:47,32 --> 1:30:52,37
science and research in the world. And when
we talk about deficits, if we’re adding


1171
1:30:52,37 --> 1:30:58,3
to our deficit for tax cuts for folks who
don’t need them, and we’re cutting investments


1172
1:30:58,3 --> 1:31:4,61
in research and science that will create the
next Apple, create the next new innovation


1173
1:31:4,61 --> 1:31:7,75
that will sell products around the world,
we will lose that race.


1174
1:31:7,75 --> 1:31:13,37
If we’re not training engineers to make
sure that they are equipped here in this country.


1175
1:31:13,37 --> 1:31:18,15
Then companies won’t come here. Those investments
are what’s going to help to make sure that


1176
1:31:18,15 --> 1:31:24,0
we continue to lead this world economy, not
just next year, but 10 years from now, 50


1177
1:31:24,0 --> 1:31:25,58
years from now, 100 years from now.
CROWLEY: Thanks Mr. President.


1178
1:31:25,58 --> 1:31:26,54
(CROSSTALK)
CROWLEY: Governor Romney?


1179
1:31:26,54 --> 1:31:28,78
ROMNEY: Government does not create jobs. Government
does not create jobs.


1180
1:31:28,78 --> 1:31:31,67
CROWLEY: Governor Romney, I want to introduce
you to Barry Green, because he’s going to


1181
1:31:31,67 --> 1:31:38,59
have the last question to you first?
ROMNEY: Barry? Where is Barry?


1182
1:31:38,59 --> 1:31:44,26
QUESTION: Hi, Governor. I think this is a
tough question. To each of you. What do you


1183
1:31:44,26 --> 1:31:50,28
believe is the biggest misperception that
the American people have about you as a man


1184
1:31:50,28 --> 1:31:56,57
and a candidate? Using specific examples,
can you take this opportunity to debunk that


1185
1:31:56,57 --> 1:32:2,3
misperception and set us straight?
ROMNEY: Thank you, and that’s an opportunity


1186
1:32:2,3 --> 1:32:8,15
for me, and I appreciate it.
In the nature of a campaign, it seems that


1187
1:32:8,15 --> 1:32:12,9
some campaigns are focused on attacking a
person rather than prescribing their own future


1188
1:32:12,9 --> 1:32:16,64
and the things they’d like to do. In the
course of that, I think the president’s


1189
1:32:16,64 --> 1:32:20,27
campaign has tried to characterize me as — as
someone who’s very different than who I


1190
1:32:20,27 --> 1:32:24,1
am.
I care about 100 percent of the American people.


1191
1:32:24,1 --> 1:32:27,48
I want 100 percent of the American people
to have a bright and prosperous future. I


1192
1:32:27,48 --> 1:32:33,47
care about our kids. I understand what it
takes to make a bright and prosperous future


1193
1:32:33,47 --> 1:32:38,36
for America again. I spent my life in the
private sector, not in government. I’m a


1194
1:32:38,36 --> 1:32:42,83
guy who wants to help with the experience
I have, the American people.


1195
1:32:42,83 --> 1:32:48,31
My — my passion probably flows from the
fact that I believe in God. And I believe


1196
1:32:48,31 --> 1:32:53,33
we’re all children of the same God. I believe
we have a responsibility to care for one another.


1197
1:32:53,33 --> 1:32:58,31
I — I served as a missionary for my church.
I served as a pastor in my congregation for


1198
1:32:58,31 --> 1:33:3,55
about 10 years. I’ve sat across the table
from people who were out of work and worked


1199
1:33:3,55 --> 1:33:7,5
with them to try and find new work or to help
them through tough times.


1200
1:33:7,5 --> 1:33:11,49
I went to the Olympics when they were in trouble
to try and get them on track. And as governor


1201
1:33:11,49 --> 1:33:17,59
of my state, I was able to get 100 percent
of my people insured, all my kids, about 98


1202
1:33:17,59 --> 1:33:22,61
percent of the adults. I was able also to
get our schools ranked number one in the nation,


1203
1:33:22,61 --> 1:33:25,89
so 100 percent of our kids would have a bright
opportunity for a future.


1204
1:33:25,89 --> 1:33:30,71
ROMNEY: I understand that I can get this country
on track again. We don’t have to settle


1205
1:33:30,71 --> 1:33:34,76
for what we’re going through. We don’t
have to settle for gasoline at four bucks.


1206
1:33:34,76 --> 1:33:39,67
We don’t have to settle for unemployment
at a chronically high level. We don’t have


1207
1:33:39,67 --> 1:33:44,89
to settle for 47 million people on food stamps.
We don’t have to settle for 50 percent of


1208
1:33:44,89 --> 1:33:49,61
kids coming out of college not able to get
work. We don’t have to settle for 23 million


1209
1:33:49,61 --> 1:33:54,11
people struggling to find a good job.
If I become president, I’ll get America


1210
1:33:54,11 --> 1:33:58,78
working again. I will get us on track to a
balanced budget. The president hasn’t. I


1211
1:33:58,78 --> 1:34:4,239
will. I’ll make sure we can reform Medicare
and Social Security to preserve them for coming


1212
1:34:4,239 --> 1:34:6,96
— coming generations. The president said
he would. He didn’t.


1213
1:34:6,96 --> 1:34:9,22
CROWLEY: Governor…
ROMNEY: I’ll get our incomes up. And by


1214
1:34:9,22 --> 1:34:13,83
the way, I’ve done these things. I served
as governor and showed I could get them done.


1215
1:34:13,83 --> 1:34:16,94
CROWLEY: Mr. President, last two minutes belong
to you.


1216
1:34:16,94 --> 1:34:24,17
OBAMA: Barry, I think a lot of this campaign,
maybe over the last four years, has been devoted


1217
1:34:24,17 --> 1:34:29,29
to this nation that I think government creates
jobs, that that somehow is the answer.


1218
1:34:29,29 --> 1:34:34,32
That’s not what I believe. I believe that
the free enterprise system is the greatest


1219
1:34:34,32 --> 1:34:41,54
engine of prosperity the world’s ever known.
I believe in self-reliance and individual


1220
1:34:41,54 --> 1:34:47,52
initiative and risk takers being rewarded.
But I also believe that everybody should have


1221
1:34:47,52 --> 1:34:52,53
a fair shot and everybody should do their
fair share and everybody should play by the


1222
1:34:52,53 --> 1:34:58,57
same rules, because that’s how our economy’s
grown. That’s how we built the world’s


1223
1:34:58,57 --> 1:35:3,63
greatest middle class.
And — and that is part of what’s at stake


1224
1:35:3,63 --> 1:35:7,71
in this election. There’s a fundamentally
different vision about how we move our country


1225
1:35:7,71 --> 1:35:13,18
forward.
I believe Governor Romney is a good man. Loves


1226
1:35:13,18 --> 1:35:20,83
his family, cares about his faith. But I also
believe that when he said behind closed doors


1227
1:35:20,83 --> 1:35:30,19
that 47 percent of the country considered
themselves victims who refuse personal responsibility,


1228
1:35:30,19 --> 1:35:34,42
think about who he was talking about.
Folks on Social Security who’ve worked all


1229
1:35:34,42 --> 1:35:42,75
their lives. Veterans who’ve sacrificed
for this country. Students who are out there


1230
1:35:42,75 --> 1:35:48,71
trying to hopefully advance their own dreams,
but also this country’s dreams. Soldiers


1231
1:35:48,71 --> 1:35:54,64
who are overseas fighting for us right now.
People who are working hard every day, paying


1232
1:35:54,64 --> 1:35:59,6
payroll tax, gas taxes, but don’t make enough
income.


1233
1:35:59,6 --> 1:36:2,7
And I want to fight for them. That’s what
I’ve been doing for the last four years.


1234
1:36:2,7 --> 1:36:7,1
Because if they succeed, I believe the country
succeeds.


1235
1:36:7,1 --> 1:36:12,3
When my grandfather fought in World War II
and he came back and he got a G.I. Bill and


1236
1:36:12,3 --> 1:36:17,4
that allowed him to go to college, that wasn’t
a handout. That was something that advanced


1237
1:36:17,4 --> 1:36:22,4
the entire country. And I want to make sure
that the next generation has those same opportunities.


1238
1:36:22,4 --> 1:36:25,34
That’s why I’m asking for your vote and
that’s why I’m asking for another four


1239
1:36:25,34 --> 1:36:28,38
years.
CROWLEY: President Obama, Governor Romney,


1240
1:36:28,38 --> 1:36:31,48
thank you for being here tonight.
On that note we have come to an end of this


1241
1:36:31,48 --> 1:36:36,81
town hall debate. Our thanks to the participants
for their time and to the people of Hofstra


1242
1:36:36,81 --> 1:36:42,28
University for their hospitality.
The next and final debate takes place Monday


1243
1:36:42,28 --> 1:36:46,38
night at Lynn (ph) University in Boca Raton,
Florida. Don’t forget to watch. Election


1244
1:36:46,38 --> 1:36:49,37
Day is three weeks from today. Don’t forget
to vote.


1245
1:36:49,37 --> 1:36:49,97
Good night.
(APPLAUSE)


1246
1:36:49,97 --> 1:38:49,97
