###9 BRAD ACKMAN: The Front Sight, the physical complex, consists
###13 of 550 acres just outside of Las Vegas.
###17 Wide open expanse of desert, so we've got
###19 lots and lots of room.
###20 No encroachment--
###21 we're free to basically develop this
###22 facility as we see fit.
###26 Well, Front Sight is the creation of Dr. Ignatius
###30 Piazza who's the founder and director.
###32 He was taking courses under Jeff Cooper back in the '80s--
###36 a long time ago.
###37 And through the training that he received under Jeff Cooper
###41 and other national instructors, he realized that
###45 this was definitely his cup of tea.
###47 And more importantly, that he could do it better.
###49 He could reach the masses, really spread the word.
###52 Spread the doctrine to those people who needed it.
###54 Not just SWAT cops and special forces military, but average,
###61 everyday citizens.
###64 MARTIN JONES: My name is Martin Jones, and I'm
###67 originally from England but I live in San Diego now.
###71 MALE SPEAKER: And how many times have you been here to
###73 Front Side?
###73 MARTIN JONES: This is my third time.
###74 For me, it's a case I get a chance to actually learn
###77 skills that I've always wanted to learn.
###79 Not so much for personal protection, but simply because
###82 I enjoy shooting.
###82 MALE SPEAKER: Why did you want to come to Front Side?
###84 TYSON MANN: Well actually, I'm planning on
###85 joining the Navy SEALs.
###87 So I'm going to get some good handgun training before I go
###91 to basic training.
###91 MALE SPEAKER: Get ahead of the curve a little bit?
###93 TYSON MANN: Yeah.
###94 MALE SPEAKER: So when are you going to go enlist?
###96 How does that process work?
###97 TYSON MANN: Actually in three days.
###98 MALE SPEAKER: In three days you're going to be signing up?
###101 BRAD ACKMAN: So as you can see in the background, we have
###103 handgun, shotgun, rifle ranges we also cater to M16s, Uzis,
###108 martial arts.
###110 We're standing on the rope and repel facility.
###112 So it's a huge facility, continues to
###114 grow all the time.
###115 That's really the nature of the facility.
###118 The training, as I mentioned a moment ago, is really geared
###122 toward the private citizen.
###123 Those people who want to come out and learn defensive
###126 tactical skills.
###127 Sometimes we get the hobbyist, kind of the weekend
###129 enthusiast, and that, too, is fine.
###131 If this is their social outlet and they want to channel it
###134 through a productive activity, firearms
###136 training, that's great.
###137 We're happy to have those folks as well.
###139 But really we're training those people who
###141 want to stay alive.
###142 JESSE PEARSON: Hi there.
###143 Jesse Pearson.
###144 P-E- A- R-S- O-N.
###145 MALE SPEAKER: P-E-A- R-S-O-N, right here.
###147 Have a seat inside.
###148 JESSE PEARSON: Thanks.
###149 
###153 CRAIG BISHOP: Here on the range, your weapon will only
###155 be one of three places--
###158 in the holster, at the ready, or pointed at the target.
###163 Say again.
###164 Your weapon will only be one of three places--
###168 in the holster, at the ready or pointed at the target.
###171 I spent both time in active duty Army and a lot of time in
###177 the National Guard in the 19th Special Forces Group.
###181 Been to a lot of places and doing a lot of Fed missions in
###186 foreign countries with them for anywhere from two weeks to
###189 a couple months for the most of it.
###191 Spent a lot of time in Korea, Thailand.
###194 Right on up here to the 10.
###199 One line, everybody the first line come up stand right on
###202 one of these little flags.
###204 -Line ASAP!
###207 Ready, fire!
###209 [GUNSHOTS]
###216 JESSE PEARSON: What did I get?
###217 A, B, C or D?
###218 TONY: Oh, I'd give you a B, that's a strong B.
###221 JESSE PEARSON: For effort I get a B.
###236 CRAIG BISHOP: If you're not here, you're late.
###238 We're starting anyway, right now.
###241 Finger off the trigger.
###244 Let him know that, I shouldn't have to come up and tell him.
###247 Yell at him.
###249 -Line ASAP!
###251 Ready, fire!
###253 [GUNSHOTS]
###260 MALE SPEAKER: How's your partner today?
###262 JESSE PEARSON: Tony?
###263 Tony's good, man.
###263 He's very encouraging.
###265 He keeps saying you can do it, you're going to get it.
###269 He told that lady next to me not to quit
###271 because she was bummed.
###272 He said don't give up.
###274 He's a man of few words, but they're well-chosen words.
###277 
###280 [GUNSHOTS]
###283 CRAIG BISHOP: You need to stay alive.
###286 You need to train the way you want to fight.
###291 Because when you get in a fight, you will
###295 fight the way you train.
###298 You will not rise to the occasion.
###302 You will sink to your level of training.
###305 So make that level of training as high and as good and
###309 realistic as you can, because that is what
###314 will keep you alive.
###315 Any questions?
###316 
###319 No shooting yourself on my range.
###324 Challenge!
###325 EVERYONE: Stop or I'll shoot!
###327 [GUNSHOTS]
###329 
###333 [GUNSHOTS]
###337 MALE SPEAKER: How'd it go?
###339 JESSE PEARSON: I don't know.
###341 I think it would've stopped him, probably.
###345 I don't know if it meets muster here, but it probably
###347 would have stopped him.
###348 MALE SPEAKER: Problem is, [INAUDIBLE] take one.
###350 JESSE PEARSON: I got the top of his crew cut.
###351 
###356 CRAIG BISHOP: I never saw any combat.
###359 Probably one the best trained guys that never was in combat.
###362 I probably would have, but I was in Coronado, I was on a
###365 combat dive team.
###367 And prior to 9/11, I was there on a training operation and
###372 shattered the arm and shoulder in a rubber raft.
###375 So I was what we refer to as "broke dick."
###379 Go in to the hospital broken up, 9/11 happened.
###382 And having operations while all my buddies ended up in
###386 Afghanistan.
###387 That's just the way it worked out.
###388 And ready!
###390 [GUNSHOTS]
###395 [GUNSHOTS]
###399 [GUNSHOTS]
###399 MALE SPEAKER: Did you feel a sense of regret
###401 on not being there?
###402 CRAIG BISHOP: Yeah, you spend that long training and then
###405 something happens and everybody else you trained
###408 with for years is going and you're not.
###411 That's the way life goes, you know?
###413 I guess you'd say it's good and bad.
###416 MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, I guess so.
###417 
###421 What's your take on the state of gun rights and gun laws and
###425 the Second Amendment in America today?
###426 MARTIN JONES: Being British, I don't know too much about the
###429 Second Amendment.
###430 But I do know it allows you to use and carry guns in the US.
###435 In Britain, you're not allowed to anymore and I
###438 think that's very sad.
###439 TYSON MANN: They are really starting to take away our gun
###442 rights that are in the Constitution which all of our
###445 laws are supposed to be based upon.
###447 So that really makes me angry.
###449 CRAIG BISHOP: I would say that if you really look at it, our
###452 whole Constitution is in tatters.
###455 We are supposed to be the most free country in the world.
###459 If you look at it, there's hardly anything we can do
###462 without buying some kind of a license, getting government
###465 permission.
###466 TONY LAZADA: I hope it doesn't come to the point wherein the
###470 law abiding citizens will just say forget everything, there's
###475 too much bureaucracy red tape.
###480 That won't be a good deal.
###481 ALEX HARPER: Obviously, the laws have to follow what the
###483 people in the community want them to be.
###485 But at same time, a lot of people are just so uneducated
###487 about weapons, about guns.
###489 And a lot of these decisions are made based on these
###492 reactionary stances that people have--
###494 just, guns are bad.
###495 TREVOR LATHAM: And I don't know where the
###496 tide is going, honestly.
###497 I don't know if the country's becoming more programmed or
###500 less programed, because it is so polarized.
###503 The crazy anti-gun people are as crazy as they ever had.
###507 And the crazy rednecks are crazy rednecks.
###511 FRANK PATTERSON: They think that they're making us safer,
###513 but they are actually making us much more in danger every
###517 time they pass a gun law.
###519 [GUNSHOTS]
###520 TONY LAZADA: Who's going to be left with handguns there aside
###522 from the cops and the military?
###525 Those that don't care for the law.
###527 They can get handguns anywhere, right?
###528 CRAIG BISHOP: You've got to fill out the
###530 paperwork to buy a gun.
###533 You've got to get permission from the
###534 government to carry one.
###536 Is that freedom?
###538 FRANK PATTERSON: A free society is one where
###544 everybody's rights are respected.
###545 
###548 But the government isn't respecting our rights when
###551 they keep taking them away from us.
###552 
###571 JESSE PEARSON: Anybody gone through yet?
###573 ALEX HARPER: No, we're actually
###574 using you as a target.
###576 JESSE PEARSON: OK, I'll be firing, too.
###579 ALEX HARPER: Well, that's good because you'll be pointed down
###581 range as will I. So that'll be in a universal position.
###584 JESSE PEARSON: Nice.
###585 MALE SPEAKER: Say that again?
###586 TREVOR LATHAM: The hostage drill is a live puppy, and if
###588 you miss you kill the puppy.
###590 So, little guy got it.
###592 Poor little guy.
###593 MALE SPEAKER: It's all for the greater good.
###594 -They got a puppy as well.
###595 MALE SPEAKER: I think I heard him say stop or
###598 I'll kill this bitch.
###600 
###604 KEN GILLETT: Situation is you're sitting at home
###606 relaxing, somebody starts beating on your door.
###608 [POUNDING ON DOOR]
###609 Where's my drugs, motherfucker?
###612 Here I come!
###613 [GUNSHOTS]
###617 Hey buddy, you need any help?
###619 You shot my friend!
###621 Ahh!
###622 [GUNSHOTS]
###626 You missed me!
###627 [GUNSHOTS]
###629 
###632 Here I come!
###634 [GUNSHOTS]
###637 Drop the gun, I'm going to kill this bitch!
###639 [GUNSHOTS]
###641 And scenario's over, back to the holster.
###644 JESSE PEARSON: That ruled.
###648 KEN GILLETT: And this guy, he's beating on your door,
###651 where's my drugs.
###651 You kind of went for the gun, but you weren't sure whether
###654 it should come out of the holster.
###655 You're in your home, somebody's beating on your
###657 door-- unless you sell drugs, I don't know.
###659 Somebody's beating on your door, where's my drugs.
###661 Gun comes out to ready.
###662 You want to be ready for this guy to kick your door in.
###666 You came up, two shots, control pair right to the
###669 nose, excellent shooting.
###672 Standard response we'd like to see is to the chest.
###674 JESSE PEARSON: The thoracic first.
###675 KEN GILLETT: Again, designated head shots do come into play.
###678 I'm not saying that it's wrong, but what we'd like to
###680 see is controlled pair to the chest first.
###682 That's a good shot, that's in the box.
###684 That round is a problem.
###686 That is now what we call a "to whom it may concern" round.
###689 That round is headed off who knows where.
###692 That could hit grandma coming up the street from the store
###695 with her groceries.
###695 It could hit the baby in the stroller or the kid at the
###698 park, who knows.
###700 Make sure you're seeing your sights and they're getting
###702 where they need to be.
###702 Again, we'd like to see two to the thoracic.
###705 You did not shoot the guy with the phone.
###706 Why?
###707 JESSE PEARSON: Because he was there to try and help me.
###709 Not a threatening position, not saying anything that was--
###713 KEN GILLETT: Had he said I'm going to beat you over the
###714 head with this phone, what would you do?
###716 JESSE PEARSON: I would've said stop or I'll shoot.
###718 KEN GILLETT: Had he raised it overhead and
###720 advanced toward you?
###721 JESSE PEARSON: Two in the thoracic.
###722 KEN GILLETT: Good.
###723 That's the exact response we're looking for.
###724 JESSE PEARSON: OK, great.
###725 KEN GILLETT: The first one's a little low, still in the box.
###728 Your second one, however, couldn't be any more centered
###732 in the box.
###733 Right there on the bridge of the nose is at dead center of
###735 the box, it's exactly what we're looking for.
###737 JESSE PEARSON: Excellent.
###737 KEN GILLETT: Excellent job on the hostage shot.
###738 JESSE PEARSON: Thanks very much.
###739 CRAIG BISHOP: In the dark it's hard for us
###742 to clearly see everybody.
###744 So we're going to need your help a lot in maintaining a
###747 safe range.
###748 My finger does not go on the trigger until I've identified
###752 positively that that's a target that I want to shoot.
###757 In your house you may hear the noise,
###759 you're doing the search.
###761 Your finger's on the trigger.
###762 The room's too light and you come up--
###765 that's the kid sneaking home through the window.
###767 
###771 JESSE PEARSON: I think this is probably the most excited I've
###773 been the whole time we've been here.
###775 I can't wait to shoot this.
###776 CRAIG BISHOP: Remember, we do not start
###778 until the go command.
###780 MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE] and then the gun starts flipping.
###782 Maximize the contacts to the back of [INAUDIBLE].
###784 [GUNSHOTS]
###789 
###792 MALE SPEAKER: How'd you do?
###793 JESSE PEARSON: Can you light me up, Mike?
###794 I don't know, we're about to find out, moment of truth.
###796 Oh, I'm low a lot.
###797 Oh, not bad, actualy.
###799 Better than I fucking do in the daylight.
###801 I'm meant to shoot at night.
###803 I'm not meant to shoot in the daytime.
###807 I'm meant to shoot when everybody else is asleep.
###809 CRAIG BISHOP: Ready!
###811 [GUNSHOTS]
###817 JESSE PEARSON: Oh!
###818 MALE SPEAKER: Oh, those aren't head shots, dude.
###820 JESSE PEARSON: This is fucked up.
###821 MALE SPEAKER: How'd you do this time?
###823 JESSE PEARSON: Not very well.
###824 MALE SPEAKER: Think he's dead, man.
###825 JESSE PEARSON: Well, the thorax I still got a bunch.
###828 MALE SPEAKER: Tell you what, why don't you take this one?
###830 JESSE PEARSON: All right, all right.
###833 Maybe I'm better at shooting never in the daytime
###836 [INAUDIBLE].
###839 [GUNSHOTS]
###846 MALE SPEAKER: How'd you do this time, Jesse?
###847 JESSE PEARSON: I don't know man.
###849 Just get that camera and shove it up your ass.
###851 
###856 CRAIG BISHOP: It's the same thing I'm doing was doing in
###858 the military.
###859 I am teaching these people skills to stay alive if they
###863 need to do it.
###864 Line ASAP!
###865 Ready, fire!
###868 [GUNSHOTS]
###870
