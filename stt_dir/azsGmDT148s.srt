1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:0,13



2
0:0:0,13 --> 0:0:1,86
STEVE: So I bet you think this
is the part of the show where


3
0:0:1,86 --> 0:0:4,75
I'm going to say, don't try
these experiments at home.


4
0:0:4,75 --> 0:0:7,33
And you're right, except
there is one experiment


5
0:0:7,33 --> 0:0:8,119
we want you to try.


6
0:0:8,119 --> 0:0:9,64
Just look for the graphic
that's right here,


7
0:0:9,64 --> 0:0:10,8
that says, try it.


8
0:0:10,8 --> 0:0:12,7
That's your signal that
you can try that


9
0:0:12,7 --> 0:0:13,71
experiment at home.


10
0:0:13,71 --> 0:0:15,31
Everything else off limits.


11
0:0:15,31 --> 0:0:17,28
Look, I've already given you
homework and the show hasn't


12
0:0:17,28 --> 0:0:18,53
even started.


13
0:0:18,53 --> 0:0:21,2



14
0:0:21,2 --> 0:0:23,79
Well, it's Monday and for
me that means 9News.


15
0:0:23,79 --> 0:0:26,63
This is the local TV station
that I work for and many of


16
0:0:26,63 --> 0:0:28,29
you have maybe seen the segments
over the years that


17
0:0:28,29 --> 0:0:29,36
we've done with 9News.


18
0:0:29,36 --> 0:0:31,48
I thought this would be a
perfect opportunity to give


19
0:0:31,48 --> 0:0:33,84
you kind of a behind the scenes
view of what it looks


20
0:0:33,84 --> 0:0:35,77
like as we prep for one
of the segments.


21
0:0:35,77 --> 0:0:38,63
And actually what it looks like
from beginning to end.


22
0:0:38,63 --> 0:0:41,26
Today, microwave science.


23
0:0:41,26 --> 0:0:44,17
So this is the best part of
getting ready for 9News is


24
0:0:44,17 --> 0:0:47,4
that you get to go to the
playroom and actually kind of


25
0:0:47,4 --> 0:0:48,9
work out some of the details.


26
0:0:48,9 --> 0:0:50,41
This is the secret hallway that
leads to the playroom.


27
0:0:50,41 --> 0:0:51,88
This is a place that
not even--


28
0:0:51,88 --> 0:0:53,64
I mean, our employees don't
even know about.


29
0:0:53,64 --> 0:0:55,604
It's secret and this is the--


30
0:0:55,604 --> 0:0:57,62
what the [BLEEP].


31
0:0:57,62 --> 0:0:58,7
Hey!


32
0:0:58,7 --> 0:1:1,27
Hey, get out of here!


33
0:1:1,27 --> 0:1:2,155
We're shooting and--


34
0:1:2,155 --> 0:1:2,995
[CROWD GROANING]


35
0:1:2,995 --> 0:1:5,905
STEVE: Just get out of here.


36
0:1:5,905 --> 0:1:6,39
Go on.


37
0:1:6,39 --> 0:1:7,96
Get out of here.


38
0:1:7,96 --> 0:1:10,47
MALE SPEAKER: Sorry, it fell
out and I picked it up.


39
0:1:10,47 --> 0:1:12,31
STEVE: How do you even know
about this place?


40
0:1:12,31 --> 0:1:12,85
MALE SPEAKER: I don't know.


41
0:1:12,85 --> 0:1:13,53
I need to get back--


42
0:1:13,53 --> 0:1:14,78
STEVE: Make people get out.


43
0:1:14,78 --> 0:1:17,44



44
0:1:17,44 --> 0:1:19,23
All right, so the challenge
is something fun


45
0:1:19,23 --> 0:1:20,665
to do in the microwave.


46
0:1:20,665 --> 0:1:24,34



47
0:1:24,34 --> 0:1:27,33
I mean, there's easy things
like, for example, there's--


48
0:1:27,33 --> 0:1:28,11
we grab a soap.


49
0:1:28,11 --> 0:1:30,43
So if you take Ivory soap, for
example, and you put it in the


50
0:1:30,43 --> 0:1:34,56
microwave, as long as it's
fresh Ivory soap--


51
0:1:34,56 --> 0:1:37,53
I do it enough so there's stuff
on hand-- as long as


52
0:1:37,53 --> 0:1:39,56
it's fresh Ivory soap.


53
0:1:39,56 --> 0:1:42,135
Ivory soap is the soap that
floats, and so we should be


54
0:1:42,135 --> 0:1:44,92
able to put that in the
microwave and have it puff up


55
0:1:44,92 --> 0:1:46,11
into these great clouds.


56
0:1:46,11 --> 0:1:47,81
This is a simple thing
that people can do,


57
0:1:47,81 --> 0:1:48,79
so we can try that.


58
0:1:48,79 --> 0:1:50,83
There's other things
that we can try.


59
0:1:50,83 --> 0:1:53,585
If you use a light bulb,
for example.


60
0:1:53,585 --> 0:1:56,75
If you take a regular light
bulb and you put a regular


61
0:1:56,75 --> 0:1:58,63
light bulb in the microwave--


62
0:1:58,63 --> 0:2:0,88
well, that would be bad because
of the metal, but the


63
0:2:0,88 --> 0:2:3,38
secret is you put it in
there with some water.


64
0:2:3,38 --> 0:2:6,65
And the energy from the
microwave actually heats up


65
0:2:6,65 --> 0:2:8,34
the tungsten and
starts to glow.


66
0:2:8,34 --> 0:2:9,94
So we can try that.


67
0:2:9,94 --> 0:2:14,82
And then, I've been saving these
for a long time, so that


68
0:2:14,82 --> 0:2:17,465
you can see this.


69
0:2:17,465 --> 0:2:19,761
Here it is.


70
0:2:19,761 --> 0:2:21,549
OK, I've been saving these
for a long time.


71
0:2:21,549 --> 0:2:22,45
Look at this.


72
0:2:22,45 --> 0:2:24,26
Empty chip bags.


73
0:2:24,26 --> 0:2:28,205
So if you take an empty chip
bag, made out of this foil


74
0:2:28,205 --> 0:2:30,75
kind of material, stick that
in the microwave--


75
0:2:30,75 --> 0:2:31,88
I'll have to look at the notes
again-- but you stick that in


76
0:2:31,88 --> 0:2:34,78
the microwave, it will heat it
up enough that it will shrink


77
0:2:34,78 --> 0:2:36,53
and you get a little miniature
bag out of the deal.


78
0:2:36,53 --> 0:2:38,61
So out of all these things
there should be something


79
0:2:38,61 --> 0:2:42,58
today, for the afternoon
spot to be able to do.


80
0:2:42,58 --> 0:2:43,83
Let's go find a microwave.


81
0:2:43,83 --> 0:2:46,974



82
0:2:46,974 --> 0:2:50,52
Here's one of these cool things
with these chip bags.


83
0:2:50,52 --> 0:2:51,56
Found this online.


84
0:2:51,56 --> 0:2:54,32
So one of our researchers found
it online of people


85
0:2:54,32 --> 0:2:56,85
doing this so don't
do this at home.


86
0:2:56,85 --> 0:2:58,31
Find a friend's microwave
and do it in


87
0:2:58,31 --> 0:2:59,67
their microwave, right?


88
0:2:59,67 --> 0:3:2,75
So find the plastic chip bags,
and use the ones that have


89
0:3:2,75 --> 0:3:5,21
what looks like little
foil that's inside.


90
0:3:5,21 --> 0:3:7,5
And again, if you have any
concern about ruining your


91
0:3:7,5 --> 0:3:9,48
microwave, then I guess
don't do this.


92
0:3:9,48 --> 0:3:13,51
So this goes here like this.


93
0:3:13,51 --> 0:3:14,42
This goes here.


94
0:3:14,42 --> 0:3:17,8
All right, so now you don't
want to do this for a long


95
0:3:17,8 --> 0:3:20,23
time, so we're just going to set
it for like a minute, but


96
0:3:20,23 --> 0:3:21,78
we're going to turn
it off right away.


97
0:3:21,78 --> 0:3:23,53
So this goes in here
like this.


98
0:3:23,53 --> 0:3:25,86
And let's do quick minute.


99
0:3:25,86 --> 0:3:26,416
All right, we're ready.


100
0:3:26,416 --> 0:3:28,46
So we're going to turn
it off once you see


101
0:3:28,46 --> 0:3:29,846
the sparks come in.


102
0:3:29,846 --> 0:3:30,252
So watch this.


103
0:3:30,252 --> 0:3:33,174
It's going to heat it up.


104
0:3:33,174 --> 0:3:34,136
Bam.


105
0:3:34,136 --> 0:3:35,18
It's really cool.


106
0:3:35,18 --> 0:3:36,89
Watch this.


107
0:3:36,89 --> 0:3:38,32
Bam, look at that.


108
0:3:38,32 --> 0:3:39,58
Look what it does.


109
0:3:39,58 --> 0:3:41,855
Now you have to be very careful,
because it's hot.


110
0:3:41,855 --> 0:3:43,67
And there's some cool
science behind this.


111
0:3:43,67 --> 0:3:45,36
It's the science of polymers,
of course.


112
0:3:45,36 --> 0:3:47,95
When these chip bags are made,
they're made out of long


113
0:3:47,95 --> 0:3:49,15
chains of molecules.


114
0:3:49,15 --> 0:3:53,26
So these polymers are stretched
out, heated, and


115
0:3:53,26 --> 0:3:56,4
then they're cooled quickly,
so it retains this kind of


116
0:3:56,4 --> 0:3:57,41
shape that you have here.


117
0:3:57,41 --> 0:3:59,54
Once we heat it get back up
again, which I think you could


118
0:3:59,54 --> 0:4:3,55
do the same thing with just an
industrial like heat gun, one


119
0:4:3,55 --> 0:4:6,24
of those things, it would shrink
it back down as well.


120
0:4:6,24 --> 0:4:7,29
But here in the microwave,
that's


121
0:4:7,29 --> 0:4:8,12
exactly what's happening.


122
0:4:8,12 --> 0:4:10,51
So you're hitting it with a lot
of power, it releases it,


123
0:4:10,51 --> 0:4:13,39
and allows those molecules to
go back to their original


124
0:4:13,39 --> 0:4:15,53
state, which is a relaxed state,
and you've got it.


125
0:4:15,53 --> 0:4:18,339
So it's kind of cool to see
the difference there.


126
0:4:18,339 --> 0:4:20,62
It's just a matter now of
whether or not this passes the


127
0:4:20,62 --> 0:4:22,71
safety test with my producer.


128
0:4:22,71 --> 0:4:26,8
She might say no to this, of
telling people at home to do


129
0:4:26,8 --> 0:4:28,74
this with chip bags.


130
0:4:28,74 --> 0:4:29,73
I think it's OK though.


131
0:4:29,73 --> 0:4:33,13
That's pretty cool went it's
been online quite a bit.


132
0:4:33,13 --> 0:4:36,16
All right, here's one that I
learned a long, long time ago.


133
0:4:36,16 --> 0:4:38,6
You have to have a
glass of water.


134
0:4:38,6 --> 0:4:39,99
Here's the glass of water.


135
0:4:39,99 --> 0:4:40,96
Got it?


136
0:4:40,96 --> 0:4:45,19
And to the glass of water we
are going to put a regular


137
0:4:45,19 --> 0:4:47,45
light bulb in the
glass of water.


138
0:4:47,45 --> 0:4:49,0
So here's the light bulb.


139
0:4:49,0 --> 0:4:49,71
Got it?


140
0:4:49,71 --> 0:4:52,4
And I know you're not supposed
to put things that are metal


141
0:4:52,4 --> 0:4:55,1
in the microwave, so to make
it so we don't get that


142
0:4:55,1 --> 0:4:58,11
sparking, we're going to put
this down inside like this.


143
0:4:58,11 --> 0:5:1,13
So now, you see how the light
bulb is submerged


144
0:5:1,13 --> 0:5:2,85
there in the water?


145
0:5:2,85 --> 0:5:4,65
I think that's exactly
what we need.


146
0:5:4,65 --> 0:5:7,1
So now, this whole thing goes
into the microwave.


147
0:5:7,1 --> 0:5:10,9



148
0:5:10,9 --> 0:5:12,75
OK, so now watch the
filament insight.


149
0:5:12,75 --> 0:5:14,15
So when we start this, watch
the filament inside.


150
0:5:14,15 --> 0:5:18,605



151
0:5:18,605 --> 0:5:21,2
See how it starts to glow?


152
0:5:21,2 --> 0:5:23,446
It's that awesome?


153
0:5:23,446 --> 0:5:24,32
And there it is.


154
0:5:24,32 --> 0:5:28,53
Here is our light bulb
like we had before.


155
0:5:28,53 --> 0:5:31,18
So the energy from the microwave
excites that


156
0:5:31,18 --> 0:5:34,81
tungsten filament that we have
inside, enough to be able to


157
0:5:34,81 --> 0:5:35,98
give off light.


158
0:5:35,98 --> 0:5:38,13
If you do it for too long,
then it cracks and you'll


159
0:5:38,13 --> 0:5:39,6
probably ruin your
microwave anyway.


160
0:5:39,6 --> 0:5:42,14
But that's very, very cool to
be able to see what it looks


161
0:5:42,14 --> 0:5:44,3
like inside when you stick
it in the microwave.


162
0:5:44,3 --> 0:5:45,97
You just have to watch it
really, really carefully.


163
0:5:45,97 --> 0:5:50,592



164
0:5:50,592 --> 0:5:51,842
So cool.


165
0:5:51,842 --> 0:5:54,43



166
0:5:54,43 --> 0:5:56,29
All right, perfect.


167
0:5:56,29 --> 0:5:59,1
There's two.


168
0:5:59,1 --> 0:6:1,31
This is one of my favorites.


169
0:6:1,31 --> 0:6:5,63
It starts with a mistake that
happened years ago, as the


170
0:6:5,63 --> 0:6:11,5
legend goes, that Ivory soap
is the soap that floats.


171
0:6:11,5 --> 0:6:14,8
And it's the soap that floats
because, supposedly, a long


172
0:6:14,8 --> 0:6:17,73
time ago the person who was
manning the whipping device


173
0:6:17,73 --> 0:6:21,88
that made the soap in the
factory, left it during a


174
0:6:21,88 --> 0:6:24,4
lunch break, and they came
back and the volume was


175
0:6:24,4 --> 0:6:27,19
overflowing and what they'd
done is they'd whipped air


176
0:6:27,19 --> 0:6:28,52
into the soap.


177
0:6:28,52 --> 0:6:31,16
And so what they found is when
they formed it into the bar--


178
0:6:31,16 --> 0:6:33,3
Ivory is the soap-- here
watch this-- it's


179
0:6:33,3 --> 0:6:35,76
the soap that floats.


180
0:6:35,76 --> 0:6:37,14
So Ivory floats.


181
0:6:37,14 --> 0:6:38,935
I guess that's a good thing.


182
0:6:38,935 --> 0:6:42,12
If you're taking a bath, I
guess, it floats to the top.


183
0:6:42,12 --> 0:6:44,23
It also is very, very
interesting.


184
0:6:44,23 --> 0:6:47,48
Now, if we use those little air
pockets that are inside


185
0:6:47,48 --> 0:6:49,98
now, to be able to stick that
in the microwave and watch


186
0:6:49,98 --> 0:6:51,64
what happens to the
expanding air.


187
0:6:51,64 --> 0:6:54,75



188
0:6:54,75 --> 0:6:58,9
So watch this.


189
0:6:58,9 --> 0:6:59,96
What I like to do is
to break it up into


190
0:6:59,96 --> 0:7:1,55
smaller chunks like this.


191
0:7:1,55 --> 0:7:4,26
So break it up.


192
0:7:4,26 --> 0:7:5,37
That's pretty good.


193
0:7:5,37 --> 0:7:7,24
It just gives it a little
bit more surface area.


194
0:7:7,24 --> 0:7:10,509



195
0:7:10,509 --> 0:7:11,91
OK.


196
0:7:11,91 --> 0:7:14,74
This will make everybody on this
floor very happy because


197
0:7:14,74 --> 0:7:19,31
when you cook this, it has this
beautiful smell to it


198
0:7:19,31 --> 0:7:21,76
that causes everybody
to come out.


199
0:7:21,76 --> 0:7:23,1
Here we go.


200
0:7:23,1 --> 0:7:25,432



201
0:7:25,432 --> 0:7:26,46
So this goes inside.


202
0:7:26,46 --> 0:7:28,79
You just kind of have to watch
the cool things that happen


203
0:7:28,79 --> 0:7:30,24
inside as it's moving around.


204
0:7:30,24 --> 0:7:31,18
Ready?


205
0:7:31,18 --> 0:7:32,43
So watch this.


206
0:7:32,43 --> 0:7:35,84



207
0:7:35,84 --> 0:7:37,55
So take a look at what
happens inside.


208
0:7:37,55 --> 0:7:40,43
As it starts to heat up, those
little pockets of air--


209
0:7:40,43 --> 0:7:43,22
of course the molecules move
away from each other--


210
0:7:43,22 --> 0:7:44,98
and it starts to expand and you


211
0:7:44,98 --> 0:7:45,87
start to see some movement.


212
0:7:45,87 --> 0:7:49,12
Oh, yeah, take a look.


213
0:7:49,12 --> 0:7:52,42
If you just stick the whole bar
inside, it'll work, but I


214
0:7:52,42 --> 0:7:54,69
found that when you break into
smaller pieces you get much


215
0:7:54,69 --> 0:7:55,94
better clouds.


216
0:7:55,94 --> 0:7:57,93



217
0:7:57,93 --> 0:7:59,6
Oh, that's great.


218
0:7:59,6 --> 0:8:0,3
Here, watch this.


219
0:8:0,3 --> 0:8:1,28
Nice.


220
0:8:1,28 --> 0:8:3,75



221
0:8:3,75 --> 0:8:4,72
Look at that.


222
0:8:4,72 --> 0:8:6,95
These small little pieces
produce these


223
0:8:6,95 --> 0:8:8,17
great results here.


224
0:8:8,17 --> 0:8:11,14
So look at the air that's
fluffed into it and


225
0:8:11,14 --> 0:8:12,8
pops back out again.


226
0:8:12,8 --> 0:8:13,89
It's hot at this point.


227
0:8:13,89 --> 0:8:15,91
You have to be careful,
but this is what


228
0:8:15,91 --> 0:8:17,1
it looks like here.


229
0:8:17,1 --> 0:8:18,44
This is easy to do.


230
0:8:18,44 --> 0:8:21,7
This will be perfect, and we can
do it in their microwave,


231
0:8:21,7 --> 0:8:23,72
and there shouldn't be any
problem with this at all.


232
0:8:23,72 --> 0:8:26,705
Now it's my job go sell the
ideas that work, minus the


233
0:8:26,705 --> 0:8:28,26
grapes, to my producer.


234
0:8:28,26 --> 0:8:31,11
So I'll let her know about the
chips and the light bulb, and,


235
0:8:31,11 --> 0:8:32,75
of course, the soap.


236
0:8:32,75 --> 0:8:35,728
And I get the OK, and we write
the segment, and we're done.


237
0:8:35,728 --> 0:8:42,9
[MUSIC PLAYING]


238
0:8:42,9 --> 0:8:48,62
All right, it's not as exciting
as all three of them,


239
0:8:48,62 --> 0:8:50,246
but I can do it.


240
0:8:50,246 --> 0:8:55,47
All right, the expanding soap
is what we're going to do.


241
0:8:55,47 --> 0:8:56,76
OK, see you this
afternoon, bye.


242
0:8:56,76 --> 0:8:59,28



243
0:8:59,28 --> 0:9:3,16
All right, so here's
how it works.


244
0:9:3,16 --> 0:9:4,52
Everything is set.


245
0:9:4,52 --> 0:9:7,58
We're about 30 minutes to air.


246
0:9:7,58 --> 0:9:11,27
This is live, so we don't
do live-to-tape.


247
0:9:11,27 --> 0:9:13,54
Got everything that you
need, hopefully.


248
0:9:13,54 --> 0:9:17,88
Sneak in the building, tell the
producer that you're here,


249
0:9:17,88 --> 0:9:19,94
set, and you're ready to go.


250
0:9:19,94 --> 0:9:21,705
Today's different because I
just have no idea where


251
0:9:21,705 --> 0:9:23,21
they're shooting.


252
0:9:23,21 --> 0:9:24,88
And you'll notice that we have
this just in case the


253
0:9:24,88 --> 0:9:27,82
microwave doesn't work, we can
at least show what happens.


254
0:9:27,82 --> 0:9:29,7
TV tricks.


255
0:9:29,7 --> 0:9:32,63



256
0:9:32,63 --> 0:9:34,63
So this is the control
room here at 9News,


257
0:9:34,63 --> 0:9:36,15
and Bob is the director.


258
0:9:36,15 --> 0:9:39,52
And my producer is Jessica,
right over there, and she's


259
0:9:39,52 --> 0:9:41,33
the one that told me that I have
to do something different


260
0:9:41,33 --> 0:9:42,72
today, so we can't
be in the studio.


261
0:9:42,72 --> 0:9:44,22
We have to be some
other place.


262
0:9:44,22 --> 0:9:47,88



263
0:9:47,88 --> 0:9:51,4
This is normally where
I bring guests and my


264
0:9:51,4 --> 0:9:52,39
boys and those things.


265
0:9:52,39 --> 0:9:54,62
If they do a good job, look,
they get to go to


266
0:9:54,62 --> 0:9:55,7
vending land over here.


267
0:9:55,7 --> 0:9:58,7
So this now is the set
for today's segment.


268
0:9:58,7 --> 0:10:1,73
So I'm assuming that we're using
a microwave here and


269
0:10:1,73 --> 0:10:4,34
we're just going to stay in here
and do the spot this way.


270
0:10:4,34 --> 0:10:7,35
So it's definitely impromptu
from what we normally do.


271
0:10:7,35 --> 0:10:9,51
I think it will be fine.


272
0:10:9,51 --> 0:10:10,64
NEWSCASTER: You're not
miked so this is us.


273
0:10:10,64 --> 0:10:12,36
STEVE: No, so this is us.


274
0:10:12,36 --> 0:10:16,13
I'll use both hands, so I'll
grab this, and I, at the end,


275
0:10:16,13 --> 0:10:17,72
will hold this for you.


276
0:10:17,72 --> 0:10:19,87
The reveal is over there,
if I ask you to grab it.


277
0:10:19,87 --> 0:10:21,28
NEWSCASTER: Oh, cool.


278
0:10:21,28 --> 0:10:23,51
All right.


279
0:10:23,51 --> 0:10:25,91
Steve's very cool science
experiment today is another


280
0:10:25,91 --> 0:10:28,78
one of those in which he warns
you, do not do this at your


281
0:10:28,78 --> 0:10:31,26
home, do this at a
friend's home.


282
0:10:31,26 --> 0:10:32,23
STEVE: Because you're in
the kitchen, right?


283
0:10:32,23 --> 0:10:33,41
Why do you want to mess
up your microwave.


284
0:10:33,41 --> 0:10:34,11
NEWSCASTER: That's
right, exactly.


285
0:10:34,11 --> 0:10:35,5
STEVE: That's exactly right.


286
0:10:35,5 --> 0:10:36,4
Do you smell that smell?


287
0:10:36,4 --> 0:10:36,26
NEWSCASTER: I do.


288
0:10:36,26 --> 0:10:39,14
STEVE: It's not eggs, it's
not, no, it's Ivory soap.


289
0:10:39,14 --> 0:10:39,49
NEWSCASTER: Oh, it's soap.


290
0:10:39,49 --> 0:10:40,53
STEVE: So this is it.


291
0:10:40,53 --> 0:10:42,8
So you're going to
need Ivory soap.


292
0:10:42,8 --> 0:10:44,51
NEWSCASTER: What a cool-- that
was a cool science experiment.


293
0:10:44,51 --> 0:10:45,8
STEVE: Isn't it kind of fun?


294
0:10:45,8 --> 0:10:45,57
Kind of fun.


295
0:10:45,57 --> 0:10:46,41
NEWSCASTER: Once again,
at a friend's


296
0:10:46,41 --> 0:10:48,78
house, not your house.


297
0:10:48,78 --> 0:10:49,75
All right, Science Guy.


298
0:10:49,75 --> 0:10:52,345
All this information available
at stevespanglerscience.com on


299
0:10:52,345 --> 0:10:53,552
the On-Air tab.


300
0:10:53,552 --> 0:10:53,984
STEVE: Got it.


301
0:10:53,984 --> 0:10:55,28
NEWSCASTER: Look for
Spangler Science.


302
0:10:55,28 --> 0:10:56,8
OK, it's 4 o'clock, and
9News continues.


303
0:10:56,8 --> 0:10:57,53
We'll be right back.


304
0:10:57,53 --> 0:10:59,67
STEVE: Just take that
to Miss Kobrick, OK?


305
0:10:59,67 --> 0:11:2,8
She'll love that for her little
bath on Saturday.


306
0:11:2,8 --> 0:11:4,26
NEWSCASTER: That was cool.


307
0:11:4,26 --> 0:11:7,39
STEVE: Three and a half minutes
later, I'm done and


308
0:11:7,39 --> 0:11:7,96
what do I do?


309
0:11:7,96 --> 0:11:10,92
No, I don't go to the trailer,
not to the green room, fresh


310
0:11:10,92 --> 0:11:11,69
fruit and--


311
0:11:11,69 --> 0:11:14,28
I'm dusting the floor now
because we've spilled all over


312
0:11:14,28 --> 0:11:18,24
the place, and we've got another
shot back here in


313
0:11:18,24 --> 0:11:21,28
about two and a half minutes.


314
0:11:21,28 --> 0:11:23,88
Hard part about doing live TV is
I never know what it really


315
0:11:23,88 --> 0:11:26,3
looks like until the very
end and I grab the tape.


316
0:11:26,3 --> 0:11:28,6
Because you never know how it
mixes down and what the camera


317
0:11:28,6 --> 0:11:29,295
shots look like.


318
0:11:29,295 --> 0:11:31,84
And in this particular case,
there's just one shot there.


319
0:11:31,84 --> 0:11:35,85
So we'll see how the whole
thing kind of played, but


320
0:11:35,85 --> 0:11:38,71
that's the only thing they've
allowed us to do is the soap


321
0:11:38,71 --> 0:11:41,82
in the microwave, because they
were fearful that kids would


322
0:11:41,82 --> 0:11:44,443
try to put the light bulb
in the microwave and


323
0:11:44,443 --> 0:11:45,3
it would blow up.


324
0:11:45,3 --> 0:11:48,95
And the chips would be a
problem, so if you happen to


325
0:11:48,95 --> 0:11:50,842
see that earlier in the show,
you didn't see it, if you know


326
0:11:50,842 --> 0:11:52,39
what I mean.


327
0:11:52,39 --> 0:11:53,82
Just the Ivory soap trick.


328
0:11:53,82 --> 0:13:53,82
