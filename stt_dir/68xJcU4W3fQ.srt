[PUNK MUSIC]


2
0:0:43,413 --> 0:0:44,411
-Tom Burt.


3
0:0:44,411 --> 0:0:45,409
Where's Tom?


4
0:0:45,409 --> 0:0:45,908
Is he still here?


5
0:0:45,908 --> 0:0:48,902
He had to catch a flight.


6
0:0:48,902 --> 0:0:51,397
[INAUDIBLE] you out there?


7
0:0:51,397 --> 0:0:52,395
Shawn, you want to--


8
0:0:52,395 --> 0:0:53,892
Yeah, come on up, Shawn.


9
0:0:53,892 --> 0:0:55,888
Shawn, you were out there
taking runs, getting in


10
0:0:55,888 --> 0:0:56,886
people's ways and stuff.


11
0:0:56,886 --> 0:0:59,381
You should have two shirts.


12
0:0:59,381 --> 0:1:3,373
Shawn Farmer-- two shirts
for being out there.


13
0:1:3,373 --> 0:1:7,95
Wasn't in the competition,
but he was in the pipe.


14
0:1:7,95 --> 0:1:9,97
DAVE SEOANE: Farmer definitely
goes through stages where he,


15
0:1:9,97 --> 0:1:11,23
like, takes care of himself.


16
0:1:11,23 --> 0:1:15,356
And he--


17
0:1:15,356 --> 0:1:18,39
this is kind of a hard one-- but
today, he's like, I would


18
0:1:18,39 --> 0:1:20,49
totally quit drinking if
I had a reason to.


19
0:1:20,49 --> 0:1:22,74
Like, if I had a girl that I
was totally in love with, I


20
0:1:22,74 --> 0:1:25,5
would probably quit drinking,
but I don't really have a


21
0:1:25,5 --> 0:1:26,71
reason to quit drinking.


22
0:1:26,71 --> 0:1:30,1
That was pretty heavy.


23
0:1:30,1 --> 0:1:33,39
Because when he drinks,
he is not afraid.


24
0:1:33,39 --> 0:1:34,71
And it's actually
kind of scary.


25
0:1:34,71 --> 0:1:36,4
He turns into this caveman.


26
0:1:36,4 --> 0:1:38,125
And you can't, you can't--


27
0:1:38,125 --> 0:1:39,66
you're like, Farm.


28
0:1:39,66 --> 0:1:40,92
And he's like a dog.


29
0:1:40,92 --> 0:1:43,502
And you have to say, Farmer--
you can't talk to him and be


30
0:1:43,502 --> 0:1:43,725
reasonable.


31
0:1:43,725 --> 0:1:45,58
You have to say, Farmer,
sit, now.


32
0:1:45,58 --> 0:1:48,232
And he'll, like, OK.


33
0:1:48,232 --> 0:1:51,985
Definitely got to be careful
about crossing the line.


34
0:1:51,985 --> 0:1:53,845
SHAWN FARMER: These [INAUDIBLE]
wool pants from


35
0:1:53,845 --> 0:1:55,78
the army store.


36
0:1:55,78 --> 0:1:58,552
A pair of Sorels, right?


37
0:1:58,552 --> 0:2:1,33
You know when your feet hurt
too bad from the pair of


38
0:2:1,33 --> 0:2:5,53
Sorels If you could get a pair
[INAUDIBLE] liners, you were


39
0:2:5,53 --> 0:2:9,685
like, Jesus Christ on a fucking
popsicle stick.


40
0:2:9,685 --> 0:2:12,11
Right?


41
0:2:12,11 --> 0:2:20,57
That's why we're here, man,
today, because we were here


42
0:2:20,57 --> 0:2:22,25
back then, man.


43
0:2:22,25 --> 0:2:24,29
-Back then?


44
0:2:24,29 --> 0:2:29,27
SHAUN WHITE: Dude, one of the
first times I met Farmer was


45
0:2:29,27 --> 0:2:31,74
at the "My Way" premiere
video.


46
0:2:31,74 --> 0:2:33,47
It was Arnette's video.


47
0:2:33,47 --> 0:2:38,1
And he showed up with, like,
fur boots and some bondage


48
0:2:38,1 --> 0:2:42,12
weird gear like this, with a
leash on his girlfriend in the


49
0:2:42,12 --> 0:2:44,8
same sort of getup.


50
0:2:44,8 --> 0:2:46,1
And I'm just like
who is this guy?


51
0:2:46,1 --> 0:2:52,8
Like, he's so unreal, and he's
never been afraid to go the


52
0:2:52,8 --> 0:2:53,53
distance for anything.


53
0:2:53,53 --> 0:2:54,85
And he's a great guy.


54
0:2:54,85 --> 0:2:58,16
He's just, like, way into
snowboarding, way into the


55
0:2:58,16 --> 0:2:59,512
back country.


56
0:2:59,512 --> 0:3:3,0
SHAWN FARMER: My house is
super trashed, man.


57
0:3:3,0 --> 0:3:5,12
Because I've just been
on the go lately.


58
0:3:5,12 --> 0:3:15,345



59
0:3:15,345 --> 0:3:16,83
I've got shit everywhere.


60
0:3:16,83 --> 0:3:23,265



61
0:3:23,265 --> 0:3:25,245
Let me scoop some of this up.


62
0:3:25,245 --> 0:3:38,33



63
0:3:38,33 --> 0:3:40,512
I have one plastic cup--
probably because I don't have


64
0:3:40,512 --> 0:3:41,762
any glasses.


65
0:3:41,762 --> 0:3:44,784



66
0:3:44,784 --> 0:3:45,712
I had one glass.


67
0:3:45,712 --> 0:3:48,5
I have one plastic cup.


68
0:3:48,5 --> 0:3:50,78
I've got that going for me.


69
0:3:50,78 --> 0:3:53,72
If someone wants to stay with
me, they can stay with me.


70
0:3:53,72 --> 0:3:56,69
I've told people all winter come
up and stay, and, like,


71
0:3:56,69 --> 0:3:59,305
nobody came and stayed with me,
dude, except for the guys


72
0:3:59,305 --> 0:4:2,9
I work with.


73
0:4:2,9 --> 0:4:4,49
It's like an emergency thing for
the guys that I work with.


74
0:4:4,49 --> 0:4:6,54
Because we plow snow and
sometimes if it snows really


75
0:4:6,54 --> 0:4:9,38
bad, then they don't have
to drive home to Reno.


76
0:4:9,38 --> 0:4:11,14
They can, like, stay up here.


77
0:4:11,14 --> 0:4:14,11
And so I'm just like
a house man--


78
0:4:14,11 --> 0:4:14,77
guy---


79
0:4:14,77 --> 0:4:16,379
house mom, I guess.


80
0:4:16,379 --> 0:4:20,32
I'm not a very good house
mom, but yeah.


81
0:4:20,32 --> 0:4:22,35
But I've been telling my
friends, man, come up.


82
0:4:22,35 --> 0:4:23,48
I have a room.


83
0:4:23,48 --> 0:4:25,53
The beds are all made
and ready for you.


84
0:4:25,53 --> 0:4:28,314



85
0:4:28,314 --> 0:4:31,71
JERRY DUGAN: You know, Sean
Farmer's an interesting


86
0:4:31,71 --> 0:4:33,96
individual on so many levels.


87
0:4:33,96 --> 0:4:37,88
He's super high-functioning
intelligent and a total idiot


88
0:4:37,88 --> 0:4:39,48
at the same time.


89
0:4:39,48 --> 0:4:41,7
I love the guy with
my whole heart.


90
0:4:41,7 --> 0:4:48,2
And he's super creative, super
talented, and is completely


91
0:4:48,2 --> 0:4:50,19
ADD, as I am.


92
0:4:50,19 --> 0:4:52,18
So he's just all
over the board.


93
0:4:52,18 --> 0:4:54,545
SHAWN FARMER: The boot drier.


94
0:4:54,545 --> 0:4:57,6
The boot drier I made.


95
0:4:57,6 --> 0:4:59,39
It goes together like this
so you can, like,


96
0:4:59,39 --> 0:5:0,99
transport it, you know?


97
0:5:0,99 --> 0:5:3,455
You put this blow dryer
on here like this.


98
0:5:3,455 --> 0:5:6,7



99
0:5:6,7 --> 0:5:8,35
It's rad.


100
0:5:8,35 --> 0:5:10,85
Sick, huh?


101
0:5:10,85 --> 0:5:14,69
Then you put your boots in.


102
0:5:14,69 --> 0:5:15,94
You put your boots in there.


103
0:5:15,94 --> 0:5:19,853



104
0:5:19,853 --> 0:5:22,18
You put this in your boots, you
know, and then your gloves


105
0:5:22,18 --> 0:5:24,42
on top of here.


106
0:5:24,42 --> 0:5:27,78
It totally kicks out the heat,
man, like in 10 minutes.


107
0:5:27,78 --> 0:5:30,19
10 minutes, you're good.


108
0:5:30,19 --> 0:5:31,8
-You should patent that.


109
0:5:31,8 --> 0:5:32,47
SHAWN FARMER: It's so bad ass.


110
0:5:32,47 --> 0:5:34,62
It's probably a fire hazard
and everything.


111
0:5:34,62 --> 0:5:36,82
I want to get a timer for it
so you can just set it for,


112
0:5:36,82 --> 0:5:38,5
like, 10 minutes
or 20 minutes.


113
0:5:38,5 --> 0:5:39,64
Because, you know, have you ever
seen those boot dryers


114
0:5:39,64 --> 0:5:40,74
that don't do anything?


115
0:5:40,74 --> 0:5:42,7
Like, what is this?


116
0:5:42,7 --> 0:5:44,14
It blows, like, room temperature
air on there?


117
0:5:44,14 --> 0:5:46,42
And you're like, what
the fuck is that?


118
0:5:46,42 --> 0:5:48,365
What you want is, like, when
you come out-- when you get


119
0:5:48,365 --> 0:5:50,262
your boots out of your car
because you forgot and left


120
0:5:50,262 --> 0:5:51,93
them in and they're
frozen solid?


121
0:5:51,93 --> 0:5:53,43
You put that thing on there.


122
0:5:53,43 --> 0:5:55,5
And I swear to god in 10
minutes, 15 minutes


123
0:5:55,5 --> 0:5:57,49
tops, it's bone dry.


124
0:5:57,49 --> 0:5:58,8
Shit is just steaming hot.


125
0:5:58,8 --> 0:6:3,385



126
0:6:3,385 --> 0:6:5,57
Maybe I should get a
different shirt.


127
0:6:5,57 --> 0:6:8,405
-I just wanted to know how you
got into snowboarding, because


128
0:6:8,405 --> 0:6:9,83
where are you from,
originally?


129
0:6:9,83 --> 0:6:10,9
SHAWN FARMER: Missouri.


130
0:6:10,9 --> 0:6:11,92
-Where at?


131
0:6:11,92 --> 0:6:13,21
SHAWN FARMER: Missoura.


132
0:6:13,21 --> 0:6:14,62
Jefferson City.


133
0:6:14,62 --> 0:6:15,58
Some people say Missoura.


134
0:6:15,58 --> 0:6:17,2
Some people say Missouri,
you know?


135
0:6:17,2 --> 0:6:18,51
No, it's Jefferson
City, Missoura.


136
0:6:18,51 --> 0:6:20,37
I just got on a thing--
you know, whatever.


137
0:6:20,37 --> 0:6:21,9
It's just a stunt.


138
0:6:21,9 --> 0:6:24,86
It's something to do for, like,
first for the actual--


139
0:6:24,86 --> 0:6:28,8
yeah, I got on what we call
the snowboard at the time.


140
0:6:28,8 --> 0:6:30,4
One of my buddies even had
one of those Sims ones.


141
0:6:30,4 --> 0:6:32,14
It's like a plastic tray
kind of thing.


142
0:6:32,14 --> 0:6:34,7
You bolt your skateboard
deck to it.


143
0:6:34,7 --> 0:6:37,885
But I mean, we just did that
because it was wintertime and


144
0:6:37,885 --> 0:6:40,38
you couldn't really
skateboard.


145
0:6:40,38 --> 0:6:41,97
And we thought it was cool.


146
0:6:41,97 --> 0:6:43,9
At one point, I graduated
from high school.


147
0:6:43,9 --> 0:6:46,81
I went to college for one
semester, and I was just like


148
0:6:46,81 --> 0:6:48,49
pretty much not into it.


149
0:6:48,49 --> 0:6:53,85
I mean, I got OK grades, and I
was like, I want to go ski.


150
0:6:53,85 --> 0:6:54,78
The idea was skiing.


151
0:6:54,78 --> 0:6:55,62
It wasn't even snowboarding.


152
0:6:55,62 --> 0:6:57,85
I was like, I was going to
ski out in Colorado.


153
0:6:57,85 --> 0:7:0,98
I was like, I'll take a semester
off, or a year off,


154
0:7:0,98 --> 0:7:3,2
and go mess around out
there and ski.


155
0:7:3,2 --> 0:7:4,44
And then I went out there.


156
0:7:4,44 --> 0:7:6,42
And then I saw a snowboard
video.


157
0:7:6,42 --> 0:7:9,28
I think it was called "One Track
Mind," or something.


158
0:7:9,28 --> 0:7:11,14
It was an old Burton one.


159
0:7:11,14 --> 0:7:14,29
Once I saw that, I was just
like, I skateboard.


160
0:7:14,29 --> 0:7:15,68
I'm getting one of those.


161
0:7:15,68 --> 0:7:17,67
Me and my buddy, Joey
[INAUDIBLE], we went to Wave


162
0:7:17,67 --> 0:7:20,125
Rave in Boulder.


163
0:7:20,125 --> 0:7:22,73
And we had like our whole
paychecks for the week.


164
0:7:22,73 --> 0:7:25,94
And we bought the only two
snowboards they had in that


165
0:7:25,94 --> 0:7:30,5
store, which was two
Burton Elite--


166
0:7:30,5 --> 0:7:32,68
yeah, Performer Elites
with no high backs.


167
0:7:32,68 --> 0:7:34,31
That was '85, '86.


168
0:7:34,31 --> 0:7:36,98
And so by the end of season--
well, no ski


169
0:7:36,98 --> 0:7:38,13
areas allowed it, really.


170
0:7:38,13 --> 0:7:43,49
We had to go to Berthoud Pass
so that we could snowboard.


171
0:7:43,49 --> 0:7:44,7
That was the only place.


172
0:7:44,7 --> 0:7:46,95
Berthoud Pass would allow
snowboarding.


173
0:7:46,95 --> 0:7:50,4
Not Summit County, not
Breckenridge, no nothing,


174
0:7:50,4 --> 0:7:51,51
until like halfway through
the season.


175
0:7:51,51 --> 0:7:52,27
Then they converted it.


176
0:7:52,27 --> 0:7:54,94
Then they had the world
championships in the spring.


177
0:7:54,94 --> 0:7:56,81
They did a complete 180.


178
0:7:56,81 --> 0:7:59,93
So then I started riding
at Breckenridge.


179
0:7:59,93 --> 0:8:2,83
And by the time it was time
for like the world


180
0:8:2,83 --> 0:8:5,84
championships, I was
pretty decent.


181
0:8:5,84 --> 0:8:7,83
Because everyone no one around
there could like--


182
0:8:7,83 --> 0:8:10,88
you couldn't ride unless
you hiked or


183
0:8:10,88 --> 0:8:11,97
went to Berthoud Pass.


184
0:8:11,97 --> 0:8:14,69
So I was in the mix
pretty quick.


185
0:8:14,69 --> 0:8:16,31
My name's Shawn Farmer.


186
0:8:16,31 --> 0:8:19,8
I've been snowboarding about
five or 10 years.


187
0:8:19,8 --> 0:8:23,12
And it's pretty much all I do.


188
0:8:23,12 --> 0:8:23,51
MIKE HATCHETT: Yeah.


189
0:8:23,51 --> 0:8:25,3
Farmer's always been
pretty much Farm.


190
0:8:25,3 --> 0:8:27,1
He's a really amazing guy.


191
0:8:27,1 --> 0:8:30,5
He's got a really unique
personality.


192
0:8:30,5 --> 0:8:32,25
And if he's on your
good side--


193
0:8:32,25 --> 0:8:35,299
I mean if you're on his good
side, it's a good thing.


194
0:8:35,299 --> 0:8:37,32
And we pretty much clicked right
off the bat, my brother


195
0:8:37,32 --> 0:8:38,74
and I and Shawn.


196
0:8:38,74 --> 0:8:40,1
And he's been my friend
ever since.


197
0:8:40,1 --> 0:8:44,39
And some people would say he's
kind of crazy in certain ways,


198
0:8:44,39 --> 0:8:46,12
and on a snowboard,
definitely.


199
0:8:46,12 --> 0:8:48,1
SHAWN FARMER: I was living
in Colorado at the time.


200
0:8:48,1 --> 0:8:50,76
And I was doing a little contest
circuit a little bit.


201
0:8:50,76 --> 0:8:53,35
And I was not really into it,
because we'd go in the


202
0:8:53,35 --> 0:8:54,73
backcountry and kind
of take pictures.


203
0:8:54,73 --> 0:8:56,11
And we always looked cool.


204
0:8:56,11 --> 0:8:59,22
And then I'd go to these events
and they had such a--


205
0:8:59,22 --> 0:9:0,99
the stuff was not that cool.


206
0:9:0,99 --> 0:9:2,4
The half pipes were horrible.


207
0:9:2,4 --> 0:9:4,11
And once and a while, I could
throw a backflip or do


208
0:9:4,11 --> 0:9:5,59
something pretty rad,
but I was never


209
0:9:5,59 --> 0:9:7,24
consistent in a half pipe.


210
0:9:7,24 --> 0:9:11,25
And I just wasn't into
the contest scene.


211
0:9:11,25 --> 0:9:14,78
And then I went to the Mount
Baker Bank Slalom is what it


212
0:9:14,78 --> 0:9:17,46
was in Washington.


213
0:9:17,46 --> 0:9:19,47
I got second place in the event
the first time I ever


214
0:9:19,47 --> 0:9:21,62
went, and then--


215
0:9:21,62 --> 0:9:24,84
behind Craig Kelly.


216
0:9:24,84 --> 0:9:27,66
Anyway, I got from Colorado
to Washington.


217
0:9:27,66 --> 0:9:30,65
And snowed like 5 feet.


218
0:9:30,65 --> 0:9:31,0
I don't know.


219
0:9:31,0 --> 0:9:33,9
It just snows and snows
and snows up there.


220
0:9:33,9 --> 0:9:34,32
And I was riding with
Craig Kelly.


221
0:9:34,32 --> 0:9:36,85
And I was like, is this how it
is all the time up here?


222
0:9:36,85 --> 0:9:38,25
And he's like, yeah,
pretty much.


223
0:9:38,25 --> 0:9:39,56
And I was like, rad.


224
0:9:39,56 --> 0:9:41,59
So next year I moved there.


225
0:9:41,59 --> 0:9:46,25
Baker's got just crazy steeps,
and it dumps there.


226
0:9:46,25 --> 0:9:48,4
MIKE HATCHETT: He was living
in Baker at one point.


227
0:9:48,4 --> 0:9:50,16
And he just was one of the
first guys to really nail


228
0:9:50,16 --> 0:9:52,59
[INAUDIBLE] lines and just
charge the steeps.


229
0:9:52,59 --> 0:9:56,59
And he was super, super
gutsy on a snowboard.


230
0:9:56,59 --> 0:9:59,21
He would just go huge.


231
0:9:59,21 --> 0:10:1,43
PAT BRIDGES: Yeah, Shawn
Farmer came in and--


232
0:10:1,43 --> 0:10:4,46



233
0:10:4,46 --> 0:10:8,1
you got to understand, in,
like, 1990, 1991, while


234
0:10:8,1 --> 0:10:8,79
everybody--


235
0:10:8,79 --> 0:10:10,49
and I mean everybody--


236
0:10:10,49 --> 0:10:15,86
who was making a living off of
snowboarding was competing, a


237
0:10:15,86 --> 0:10:19,75
small group of guys, as opposed
to competing, they cut


238
0:10:19,75 --> 0:10:21,25
down on their contest regimen.


239
0:10:21,25 --> 0:10:25,2
Instead of doing one a month,
they decided to do two a year.


240
0:10:25,2 --> 0:10:26,63
And they started filming.


241
0:10:26,63 --> 0:10:31,17
And they saw that this is a
way to take a sport that's


242
0:10:31,17 --> 0:10:36,22
cold, remote, and bring
it to the masses.


243
0:10:36,22 --> 0:10:39,3
SHAWN FARMER: But to rewind
little bit, Nick Perata, I met


244
0:10:39,3 --> 0:10:43,6
him when I was competing and
touring around Colorado.


245
0:10:43,6 --> 0:10:46,22
At one point a buddy of his--
they were from LA.


246
0:10:46,22 --> 0:10:47,63
One of his buddies
was from LA.


247
0:10:47,63 --> 0:10:49,65
And he was into filming,
16 millimeter.


248
0:10:49,65 --> 0:10:51,87
And they started making
this movie.


249
0:10:51,87 --> 0:10:52,6
And they were just like,
hey, do you want


250
0:10:52,6 --> 0:10:53,53
to be in this movie?


251
0:10:53,53 --> 0:10:55,24
And I'm like, cool, let's
do the movie.


252
0:10:55,24 --> 0:10:57,6
So I mean, it's sort
of a blur.


253
0:10:57,6 --> 0:11:2,41
It was like the Hatchett
brothers, Nick Perata, our


254
0:11:2,41 --> 0:11:5,14
buddy Jeff--


255
0:11:5,14 --> 0:11:7,25
this Jeff dude from--


256
0:11:7,25 --> 0:11:9,3
I can't remember his last
name right now.


257
0:11:9,3 --> 0:11:9,59
Whatever.


258
0:11:9,59 --> 0:11:13,31
We just started making this
movie, man, "Totally Board 1."


259
0:11:13,31 --> 0:11:14,26
MIKE HATCHETT: It was
our first film.


260
0:11:14,26 --> 0:11:16,36
And we really didn't have--


261
0:11:16,36 --> 0:11:21,12
the concept wasn't out there of
shooting dudes' segments on


262
0:11:21,12 --> 0:11:21,89
this certain person.


263
0:11:21,89 --> 0:11:23,56
There was no real set formula.


264
0:11:23,56 --> 0:11:24,63
Those guys were our bros.


265
0:11:24,63 --> 0:11:26,96
And they were available
to shoot.


266
0:11:26,96 --> 0:11:28,59
And we decided to commit
a whole winter to it.


267
0:11:28,59 --> 0:11:32,6
Basically was just Nick, Dave,
and Shawn were the main stars


268
0:11:32,6 --> 0:11:33,97
of that movie.


269
0:11:33,97 --> 0:11:35,19
SHAWN FARMER: I mean I
did some cool stuff.


270
0:11:35,19 --> 0:11:39,37
I jumped the Mount
Baker road gap--


271
0:11:39,37 --> 0:11:41,92
that I'd heard talked
about forever.


272
0:11:41,92 --> 0:11:44,49
But I never saw any
pictures of it.


273
0:11:44,49 --> 0:11:46,33
So I was just like, right
here, right here?


274
0:11:46,33 --> 0:11:46,77
This is it?


275
0:11:46,77 --> 0:11:47,76
OK.


276
0:11:47,76 --> 0:11:48,99
Let's got up there
and do that.


277
0:11:48,99 --> 0:11:50,43
MIKE HATCHETT: He was definitely
one of the


278
0:11:50,43 --> 0:11:56,34
ballsiest snowboarders back in
that day in '88, '89, '90.


279
0:11:56,34 --> 0:11:58,42
We we're driving up
to Baker to shoot.


280
0:11:58,42 --> 0:11:59,84
And we were like, that looks
like a place you


281
0:11:59,84 --> 0:12:0,89
could jump the road.


282
0:12:0,89 --> 0:12:3,88
We just built a kicker and Shawn
jumped it and didn't


283
0:12:3,88 --> 0:12:5,78
really think that much of it.


284
0:12:5,78 --> 0:12:7,64
SHAWN FARMER: I almost got hurt
on that a couple times,


285
0:12:7,64 --> 0:12:11,1
just on the in run, coming in,
like, fell down, like,


286
0:12:11,1 --> 0:12:12,31
directly over the road.


287
0:12:12,31 --> 0:12:16,0
The snow just dumped off, and I
was like, oh my god, but did


288
0:12:16,0 --> 0:12:19,42
it again and pulled
that pretty clean.


289
0:12:19,42 --> 0:12:22,6
MIKE RANQUET: I remember I was
sitting on the road drinking


290
0:12:22,6 --> 0:12:25,26
beers, just going, what
a fucking nut bag.


291
0:12:25,26 --> 0:12:28,43
And he kept coming over.


292
0:12:28,43 --> 0:12:31,52
He was like, hey Ranquet,
I'm going to do it


293
0:12:31,52 --> 0:12:32,66
with my shirt off.


294
0:12:32,66 --> 0:12:34,8
You know, peels his shirt off.


295
0:12:34,8 --> 0:12:34,902
He's just cut.


296
0:12:34,902 --> 0:12:36,7
I'm like, what are you doing?


297
0:12:36,7 --> 0:12:39,37
And he pulled it, just did this
sweet kicked out method


298
0:12:39,37 --> 0:12:40,53
air and landed it.


299
0:12:40,53 --> 0:12:43,21
Didn't even eat shit
like I expected--


300
0:12:43,21 --> 0:12:45,6
wanted him to.


301
0:12:45,6 --> 0:12:46,65
SHAWN FARMER: Jeff Tulloch,
he did it to.


302
0:12:46,65 --> 0:12:48,22
I don't think anyone even
knows that he did it.


303
0:12:48,22 --> 0:12:49,55
But he did it too.


304
0:12:49,55 --> 0:12:51,2
MIKE HATCHETT: Shawn had to duck
under this tree branch


305
0:12:51,2 --> 0:12:53,89
right before the in run,
because it was low.


306
0:12:53,89 --> 0:12:55,89
I'm sure someone hacked it off
with a tree saw by now.


307
0:12:55,89 --> 0:12:58,115
But it was just a small branch
going across the in run.


308
0:12:58,115 --> 0:13:0,9
But of course, back in the day,
we didn't think about


309
0:13:0,9 --> 0:13:2,7
doing stuff like that.


310
0:13:2,7 --> 0:13:5,7
I would never cut a tree
branch down either.


311
0:13:5,7 --> 0:13:6,54
SHAWN FARMER: I think I was
the first one to hit that.


312
0:13:6,54 --> 0:13:7,4
Now guys--


313
0:13:7,4 --> 0:13:8,5
I did a method over it.


314
0:13:8,5 --> 0:13:12,73
Now guys are doing rodeos and
who knows what over it.


315
0:13:12,73 --> 0:13:15,39
Plus, they build a cheese wedge
that's six feet high.


316
0:13:15,39 --> 0:13:19,0
I mean, we built like-- for
us a kicker was like,


317
0:13:19,0 --> 0:13:21,14
OK, we got a kicker.


318
0:13:21,14 --> 0:13:22,986
Stomp on that little bit.


319
0:13:22,986 --> 0:13:25,89
That was it.


320
0:13:25,89 --> 0:13:27,29
And then we got to
go to Alaska.


321
0:13:27,29 --> 0:13:27,85
I don't know.


322
0:13:27,85 --> 0:13:32,29
All this stuff happened in
a short period of time.


323
0:13:32,29 --> 0:13:33,16
I was in Colorado.


324
0:13:33,16 --> 0:13:35,87
I was riding Sims boards.


325
0:13:35,87 --> 0:13:37,98
Then I was in Washington.


326
0:13:37,98 --> 0:13:40,25
Next thing I knew, I
was on G&S boards.


327
0:13:40,25 --> 0:13:43,83
Because what happened was, I
went from Washington to Tahoe


328
0:13:43,83 --> 0:13:47,84
to film some more after we
filmed all spring and winter.


329
0:13:47,84 --> 0:13:51,32
And then we got sent that summer
to Alaska with K2, just


330
0:13:51,32 --> 0:13:52,2
because, hey, you want
to be on K2?


331
0:13:52,2 --> 0:13:53,0
We'll pay you.


332
0:13:53,0 --> 0:13:54,72
And I go, OK.


333
0:13:54,72 --> 0:13:57,15
The K2 thing was probably
my best run.


334
0:13:57,15 --> 0:13:58,61
And then we just started
jumping off


335
0:13:58,61 --> 0:14:0,35
stuff up there in Alaska.


336
0:14:0,35 --> 0:14:5,25
They dropped us off on a glacier
with an airplane.


337
0:14:5,25 --> 0:14:6,73
We're flying in on the airplane


338
0:14:6,73 --> 0:14:7,97
looking up at the mountain.


339
0:14:7,97 --> 0:14:9,43
It's like you're down in
here in the airplane.


340
0:14:9,43 --> 0:14:10,5
Here's this face.


341
0:14:10,5 --> 0:14:12,89
And you're going,
[WHINING SOUND].


342
0:14:12,89 --> 0:14:17,99
You're looking up at this rock
wall, just going, damn.


343
0:14:17,99 --> 0:14:20,79
And then we got dropped off with
a bunch of, like, free


344
0:14:20,79 --> 0:14:26,64
heel ski gear and a bunch of
crampons and backpacks.


345
0:14:26,64 --> 0:14:28,51
I didn't know nothing about any
of that stuff-- a bunch of


346
0:14:28,51 --> 0:14:30,28
dried food and stuff.


347
0:14:30,28 --> 0:14:33,68
Luckily the people that were
with us were organized enough


348
0:14:33,68 --> 0:14:34,63
to get the good stuff.


349
0:14:34,63 --> 0:14:37,7
And the North Face, we had
all the North Face gear--


350
0:14:37,7 --> 0:14:39,72
North Face tents,
North Face bags.


351
0:14:39,72 --> 0:14:42,19
And just started climbing this
mountain, the Moose's Tooth,


352
0:14:42,19 --> 0:14:43,59
which is 9,000.


353
0:14:43,59 --> 0:14:47,592
Doesn't sound like a lot, but up
there, 9,000 is like 9,000,


354
0:14:47,592 --> 0:14:48,54
you know what I mean?


355
0:14:48,54 --> 0:14:51,73
It's like 8,000 feet
above the glaciers.


356
0:14:51,73 --> 0:14:52,59
So you're up there.


357
0:14:52,59 --> 0:14:55,46
We were definitely some of the
first snowboarders to get


358
0:14:55,46 --> 0:14:59,18
recognition for going up there,
and certainly probably


359
0:14:59,18 --> 0:15:3,23
one of only a handful of people
from the lower 48, as


360
0:15:3,23 --> 0:15:5,71
they call it, to go up there
and do that stuff.


361
0:15:5,71 --> 0:15:8,86
My other buddies were from
Alaska, so they were dinking


362
0:15:8,86 --> 0:15:10,3
around and getting
in some hellies.


363
0:15:10,3 --> 0:15:14,11
But we were some of the first
guys, probably out of a


364
0:15:14,11 --> 0:15:16,2
handful of five people--


365
0:15:16,2 --> 0:15:20,91
maybe Zellers and Burt and me
and Nick and Pappas were the


366
0:15:20,91 --> 0:15:24,43
first guys to do it,
really, for sure.


367
0:15:24,43 --> 0:15:30,48
Well it was "Totally Board" and
then Hatchett worked for


368
0:15:30,48 --> 0:15:33,15
Fall Line Films one year.


369
0:15:33,15 --> 0:15:35,32
JERRY DUGAN: Shawn Farmer came
into the scene in "Critical


370
0:15:35,32 --> 0:15:37,37
Condition," which would have
been our third film.


371
0:15:37,37 --> 0:15:41,4
And he had worked with--


372
0:15:41,4 --> 0:15:43,8
it was the original "Totally
Board." And it got a little


373
0:15:43,8 --> 0:15:46,85
bit of play, and then kind of
disappeared off the map.


374
0:15:46,85 --> 0:15:50,51
And that year, Hatchett
came to work for me.


375
0:15:50,51 --> 0:15:53,5
Farmer, who was working with
them, really had no film


376
0:15:53,5 --> 0:15:54,82
company to go to.


377
0:15:54,82 --> 0:15:59,67
So he called me and just was
like pretty much the cockiest


378
0:15:59,67 --> 0:16:0,865
asshole you ever
would have met.


379
0:16:0,865 --> 0:16:3,72
He was just like, dude,
your film needs me.


380
0:16:3,72 --> 0:16:4,95
I'm like, what do you mean
my film need you?


381
0:16:4,95 --> 0:16:6,65
He's like, dude, no one's
doing the kind


382
0:16:6,65 --> 0:16:7,57
of stuff I'm doing.


383
0:16:7,57 --> 0:16:9,32
You need me in your film.


384
0:16:9,32 --> 0:16:11,4
And he just wouldn't
stop calling.


385
0:16:11,4 --> 0:16:12,98
At some point, I'm just
like, dude, come on.


386
0:16:12,98 --> 0:16:13,84
I saw your film.


387
0:16:13,84 --> 0:16:15,15
I saw you do some stuff in it.


388
0:16:15,15 --> 0:16:16,2
Yeah, you're OK.


389
0:16:16,2 --> 0:16:17,86
But you've kind of got
this ape-like style.


390
0:16:17,86 --> 0:16:20,24
And you're kind of Cro-Magnon.


391
0:16:20,24 --> 0:16:22,72
And he just kept calling.


392
0:16:22,72 --> 0:16:24,58
SHAWN FARMER: They
called me, man.


393
0:16:24,58 --> 0:16:26,64
That part is bullshit.


394
0:16:26,64 --> 0:16:30,36
"Farmer called us." They called
me, or they at least,


395
0:16:30,36 --> 0:16:33,19
like, put the word out.


396
0:16:33,19 --> 0:16:36,99
I was just like, OK, these
guys want to do it.


397
0:16:36,99 --> 0:16:38,91
I'm available.


398
0:16:38,91 --> 0:16:40,79
Point the camera at me.


399
0:16:40,79 --> 0:16:43,8
They wanted to put
me on the map.


400
0:16:43,8 --> 0:16:44,8
JERRY DUGAN: Finally
that's where we


401
0:16:44,8 --> 0:16:44,72
came up with the thing.


402
0:16:44,72 --> 0:16:45,94
It was like, fine, dude.


403
0:16:45,94 --> 0:16:47,55
Put up or shut up.


404
0:16:47,55 --> 0:16:49,59
We sent him a bus ticket because
he was stuck in Utah.


405
0:16:49,59 --> 0:16:50,61
He couldn't get out to Tahoe.


406
0:16:50,61 --> 0:16:52,4
He couldn't get himself
here to film.


407
0:16:52,4 --> 0:16:53,22
So I was like fine.


408
0:16:53,22 --> 0:16:56,3
We sent him a bus ticket and
said, put up or shut up.


409
0:16:56,3 --> 0:16:57,69
You're talking all this smack.


410
0:16:57,69 --> 0:16:58,69
Back it up.


411
0:16:58,69 --> 0:17:1,61
SHAWN FARMER: You know, I think
it's basically pretty


412
0:17:1,61 --> 0:17:3,2
close to the truth.


413
0:17:3,2 --> 0:17:6,3
I don't remember
riding the bus.


414
0:17:6,3 --> 0:17:8,5
I think I might have bought
my own plane ticket.


415
0:17:8,5 --> 0:17:10,74
I think they said they'd
buy me a plane ticket.


416
0:17:10,74 --> 0:17:12,74
And I was like, fuck you guys.


417
0:17:12,74 --> 0:17:15,89
I'll just buy my own fucking
plane ticket.


418
0:17:15,89 --> 0:17:16,98
And so I came out.


419
0:17:16,98 --> 0:17:21,369
And then we came out of the
bus station or whatever.


420
0:17:21,369 --> 0:17:23,42
Anyway, there was
some argument.


421
0:17:23,42 --> 0:17:27,89
There was definitely some
argument or issue there.


422
0:17:27,89 --> 0:17:29,75
JERRY DUGAN: And I think he
pretty much lived with me on


423
0:17:29,75 --> 0:17:34,24
off for two or three years
after that point.


424
0:17:34,24 --> 0:17:37,17
Sponsorship and him were a
really tough animal to sort of


425
0:17:37,17 --> 0:17:38,91
cohabitate together.


426
0:17:38,91 --> 0:17:46,37
He was a very outspoken
and not always


427
0:17:46,37 --> 0:17:47,67
controllable commodity.


428
0:17:47,67 --> 0:17:50,14
And he's got a million things
and a million ideas and a


429
0:17:50,14 --> 0:17:51,815
million things he wants to do.


430
0:17:51,815 --> 0:17:53,53
And when he gets something in
his head, he just doesn't


431
0:17:53,53 --> 0:17:58,42
really let it rest until he
gets it out and does it.


432
0:17:58,42 --> 0:18:1,24
And that was kind
of like his rap.


433
0:18:1,24 --> 0:18:3,4
He wanted to be a rap star,
not just a snowboard star.


434
0:18:3,4 --> 0:18:5,4
He wanted to be a
rap star too.


435
0:18:5,4 --> 0:18:9,36
So we gave him a shot at it.


436

[MUSIC - SHAWN FARMER,
"FARMER'S RAP"]


437
0:18:10,61 --> 0:18:14,2



438
0:18:14,2 --> 0:18:16,865
SHAWN FARMER: I think I just
kept hammering on Jerry and


439
0:18:16,865 --> 0:18:18,25
going, man, I want
to make a video.


440
0:18:18,25 --> 0:18:19,19
I want to make a rap video.


441
0:18:19,19 --> 0:18:19,91
I want to make a song.


442
0:18:19,91 --> 0:18:22,82
I got this song, you know?


443
0:18:22,82 --> 0:18:24,18
He's like, fine, let's do it.


444
0:18:24,18 --> 0:18:27,93
And luckily, he had this
buddy who could loop.


445
0:18:27,93 --> 0:18:30,84
As soon as I heard that people
were looping beats, I was like


446
0:18:30,84 --> 0:18:33,77
man, you take a song that's
already a hit


447
0:18:33,77 --> 0:18:36,58
and sing on it again?


448
0:18:36,58 --> 0:18:40,63
How can you go wrong, unless
you're a total retard?


449
0:18:40,63 --> 0:18:42,22
I was like, here's what
I want to do.


450
0:18:42,22 --> 0:18:44,49
I want to take this
Doors lick.


451
0:18:44,49 --> 0:18:48,6
And don't ask me how they got
away with that or what the


452
0:18:48,6 --> 0:18:49,74
hell they did, if
they settled.


453
0:18:49,74 --> 0:18:51,2
I have no idea.


454
0:18:51,2 --> 0:18:54,5
JERRY DUGAN: My original partner
in my first company


455
0:18:54,5 --> 0:18:57,2
with Artie was this guy
named Kendrick Wells.


456
0:18:57,2 --> 0:19:0,17
And he was an old friend of mine
I grew up with in Marin.


457
0:19:0,17 --> 0:19:3,85
And he had a little recording
studio and


458
0:19:3,85 --> 0:19:5,19
recorded some rappers.


459
0:19:5,19 --> 0:19:7,165
He was one of Tupac's
really good friends.


460
0:19:7,165 --> 0:19:10,28
And he worked with Farmer and
myself to come up with that


461
0:19:10,28 --> 0:19:11,59
first song.


462
0:19:11,59 --> 0:19:14,74
SHAWN FARMER: I was loaded one
day and dropped a 40 in the


463
0:19:14,74 --> 0:19:18,72
studio and broke it all over all
the wires and everything.


464
0:19:18,72 --> 0:19:20,65
That was the kind
of stuff I did.


465
0:19:20,65 --> 0:19:21,63
But we got it done.


466
0:19:21,63 --> 0:19:24,46
And then I think I did
one take, I know


467
0:19:24,46 --> 0:19:25,37
not more than two.


468
0:19:25,37 --> 0:19:28,87
I was just like, man,
I feel it right now.


469
0:19:28,87 --> 0:19:30,3
But if you keep making
me do this over


470
0:19:30,3 --> 0:19:32,63
and over, I'll just--


471
0:19:32,63 --> 0:19:35,25
I think we did one take and a
couple overdubs, and that was


472
0:19:35,25 --> 0:19:38,48
it, and a couple of
punch tracks.


473
0:19:38,48 --> 0:19:39,83
JERRY DUGAN: Those were the old
days before we knew you


474
0:19:39,83 --> 0:19:40,64
could attach cameras.


475
0:19:40,64 --> 0:19:43,14
I think I just pretty much
hung out on the hood.


476
0:19:43,14 --> 0:19:46,66
It was back old school style
before I knew about cool


477
0:19:46,66 --> 0:19:49,89
mounts and fancy rigging
and grips and gaffers.


478
0:19:49,89 --> 0:19:51,91
You can get a lot more done in
life sometimes before you know


479
0:19:51,91 --> 0:19:53,13
how to do it.


480
0:19:53,13 --> 0:19:56,14
You just do it, and
it kind of works.


481
0:19:56,14 --> 0:19:58,42
SHAWN FARMER: So I knew
that would work.


482
0:19:58,42 --> 0:20:0,99
And whether it's a hit
or not, I don't care.


483
0:20:0,99 --> 0:20:1,68
But people like it.


484
0:20:1,68 --> 0:20:2,33
I dig it.


485
0:20:2,33 --> 0:20:5,62
And I thought it came
out pretty good.


486
0:20:5,62 --> 0:20:6,63
They did a good job.


487
0:20:6,63 --> 0:20:9,54
And I think they did pretty
awesome production.


488
0:20:9,54 --> 0:20:12,48
Back then, that year, that
movie was the shit.


489
0:20:12,48 --> 0:20:16,47
It was like, yeah, at the
trade show or whatever.


490
0:20:16,47 --> 0:20:18,59
JERRY DUGAN: There's very few
people I've been as impressed


491
0:20:18,59 --> 0:20:19,37
with as him.


492
0:20:19,37 --> 0:20:23,8
He is one of the ballsiest
technicians I've ever met.


493
0:20:23,8 --> 0:20:26,11
We'll be on the ground.


494
0:20:26,11 --> 0:20:27,43
We'll be back at the
barbie angles.


495
0:20:27,43 --> 0:20:28,48
We used to call it the
barbecue angle.


496
0:20:28,48 --> 0:20:30,1
And he'll look at a line-- he's
like, I'm going to make


497
0:20:30,1 --> 0:20:32,58
two turns, I'm going to pop off
here, jump 20 feet, land


498
0:20:32,58 --> 0:20:35,83
on that patch right there, you
know, 15-foot patch of snow,


499
0:20:35,83 --> 0:20:38,47
get it together and then
pop off that 50-footer.


500
0:20:38,47 --> 0:20:41,53
And I'm like, OK have fun.


501
0:20:41,53 --> 0:20:42,34
I'll be down here.


502
0:20:42,34 --> 0:20:43,16
I've got the angle.


503
0:20:43,16 --> 0:20:43,993
You go.


504
0:20:43,993 --> 0:20:45,73
And he'll go up there and he'll
just fricking do it


505
0:20:45,73 --> 0:20:46,66
every time.


506
0:20:46,66 --> 0:20:49,66
It's just, his awareness of
where he was in spatial


507
0:20:49,66 --> 0:20:52,82
relationship to the mountains,
the snow, and his ability to


508
0:20:52,82 --> 0:20:57,93
get himself to where he said
was hands down better than


509
0:20:57,93 --> 0:21:2,45
almost everyone, except, I'd
say, like, Tom Burt.


510
0:21:2,45 --> 0:21:3,25
DAMIAN SANDERS: Farmer
was bad ass.


511
0:21:3,25 --> 0:21:5,49
He was like a bear.


512
0:21:5,49 --> 0:21:7,31
He was almost like a biker.


513
0:21:7,31 --> 0:21:7,97
He was a big guy.


514
0:21:7,97 --> 0:21:8,93
He had all that crazy hair.


515
0:21:8,93 --> 0:21:10,31
But he was just funny.


516
0:21:10,31 --> 0:21:12,53
He was hilarious back
in the days.


517
0:21:12,53 --> 0:21:14,55
We had so much fun riding
together-- a


518
0:21:14,55 --> 0:21:15,18
hell of a lot of talent.


519
0:21:15,18 --> 0:21:18,1
He could ride steep cliffs
and big jumps


520
0:21:18,1 --> 0:21:19,25
like nobody's business.


521
0:21:19,25 --> 0:21:20,93
He was like a Tom Burt-style
rider.


522
0:21:20,93 --> 0:21:23,6
Those guys were kind of
in the same world.


523
0:21:23,6 --> 0:21:28,516
TOM BURT: Farmer was kind
of a loose cannon rider.


524
0:21:28,516 --> 0:21:31,29
He kind of did a little
bit of everything, but


525
0:21:31,29 --> 0:21:32,79
mostly he free rode.


526
0:21:32,79 --> 0:21:36,58
So he rode kind of
big mountains.


527
0:21:36,58 --> 0:21:39,5
But he also did tricks
and airs and


528
0:21:39,5 --> 0:21:42,22
stupid stunts and things.


529
0:21:42,22 --> 0:21:43,62
But he was actually
real progressive.


530
0:21:43,62 --> 0:21:47,76
He was doing back
flips to fakie.


531
0:21:47,76 --> 0:21:51,69
He was the first person I ever
saw do anything with that.


532
0:21:51,69 --> 0:21:54,95
Pretty early on, the only other
kind of guy landing


533
0:21:54,95 --> 0:21:58,21
fakie was Ranquet
at that time.


534
0:21:58,21 --> 0:22:4,37
But he brought another character
to the sport.

SHAWN FARMER: I still think
the "Critical Condition"


536
0:22:5,6 --> 0:22:8,39
part's probably my best thing.


537
0:22:8,39 --> 0:22:11,65
I had a lot of delusions of
grandeur and stuff, and just


538
0:22:11,65 --> 0:22:13,92
get sidetracked.


539
0:22:13,92 --> 0:22:15,4
I like rapping.


540
0:22:15,4 --> 0:22:16,98
Really, at the time, I was like,
man, all I'm going to do


541
0:22:16,98 --> 0:22:18,79
is I'm going to make
this rhyme.


542
0:22:18,79 --> 0:22:20,1
And I'm just going to walk.


543
0:22:20,1 --> 0:22:21,95
I'm going to step right out of
this whole thing and just


544
0:22:21,95 --> 0:22:25,47
start doing hip hop.


545
0:22:25,47 --> 0:22:27,43
And then, I don't know, man.


546
0:22:27,43 --> 0:22:28,84
I love the mountains.


547
0:22:28,84 --> 0:22:31,5
The city just fucks me up.


548
0:22:31,5 --> 0:22:34,73
And that's where it seems like
all that glamour boy shit goes


549
0:22:34,73 --> 0:22:37,26
on, or even the production
stuff.


550
0:22:37,26 --> 0:22:40,13
If I have to actually drive
around down there and try to


551
0:22:40,13 --> 0:22:44,15
figure this shit out, I'll
literally just turn around and


552
0:22:44,15 --> 0:22:46,16
leave town.


553
0:22:46,16 --> 0:22:47,8
I just freak out.


554
0:22:47,8 --> 0:22:50,35
I freak out in Reno.

557
0:23:0,32 --> 0:23:1,29
he's a buddy mine.


558
0:23:1,29 --> 0:23:4,615
I met that guy in '85
or '86 or '87 when I


559
0:23:4,615 --> 0:23:5,75
was still in Colorado.


560
0:23:5,75 --> 0:23:8,79
He was always this crazy
heavy metal dude.


561
0:23:8,79 --> 0:23:10,99
The band we were in
was called Soak.


562
0:23:10,99 --> 0:23:12,13
But he just kind of
brought me in.


563
0:23:12,13 --> 0:23:14,63
He was like, we want to put
rap with metal, which was


564
0:23:14,63 --> 0:23:16,95
really a novel idea
at the time.


565
0:23:16,95 --> 0:23:18,62
I still don't think anyone
is doing it right.


566
0:23:18,62 --> 0:23:20,4
I mean, there's a couple guys.


567
0:23:20,4 --> 0:23:21,65
There's Rage Against The
Machine and Anthrax.


568
0:23:21,65 --> 0:23:24,21
We were doing it right at the
same time or maybe even before


569
0:23:24,21 --> 0:23:24,93
some of those guys.


570
0:23:24,93 --> 0:23:29,375

you can be the rapper.


571
0:23:29,375 --> 0:23:32,53
And I'm like, OK, but we were
always butting heads.


572
0:23:32,53 --> 0:23:34,24
It's so hard to have
two singers.


573
0:23:34,24 --> 0:23:36,6
Played in that band for quite
a few years off and on.


574
0:23:36,6 --> 0:23:38,5
It's just so sort to balance.

0:23:38,5 --> 0:23:40,32
You're trying to be a pro
snowboarder and go whatever,


576
0:23:40,32 --> 0:23:45,6
around the world, and then
come back to this band.

SHAWN FARMER: And that whole
game is so crazy, but I still


583
0:24:12,93 --> 0:24:13,62
am into it.


584
0:24:13,62 --> 0:24:14,74
I still like rapping
and stuff.

0:24:14,74 --> 0:24:16,6
And I love snowboarding.

0:24:16,6 --> 0:24:17,46
I still love snowboarding.


587
0:24:17,46 --> 0:24:20,47
I don't care whether anyone's
around or not.


588
0:24:20,47 --> 0:24:21,86
I just dig it.


589
0:24:21,86 --> 0:24:24,38
The thing that trips me out,
man, is like if things


590
0:24:24,38 --> 0:24:28,47
would've fell together
differently, we'd probably be


591
0:24:28,47 --> 0:24:31,67
sitting in my mansion by
the pool or something.


592
0:24:31,67 --> 0:24:33,77
But it didn't.


593
0:24:33,77 --> 0:24:35,55
And I don't know--


594
0:24:35,55 --> 0:24:38,6
sometimes I feel like you're
just chasing that thing.


595
0:24:38,6 --> 0:24:41,17
And for some people, it all
happens, and when it is


596
0:24:41,17 --> 0:24:45,386
happening, you better get
it, and hang onto it as

turns, I think.

0:24:50,63 --> 0:24:54,45

than deal with some of these

But I just saw a lot of
this stuff coming.


604
0:25:1,77 --> 0:25:9,39
And I was just like, man, you
just want to be with people


605
0:25:9,39 --> 0:25:10,93
that you trust or that
you believe in.


606
0:25:10,93 --> 0:25:13,33
And I just think a lot of these
people are just like,


607
0:25:13,33 --> 0:25:15,915
yo, what's the next big thing.


608
0:25:15,915 --> 0:25:19,75

611
0:25:24,83 --> 0:25:28,28
JERRY DUGAN: I think that he
scared a lot of people,


612
0:25:28,28 --> 0:25:31,57
because he was a little
bit of a loose cannon.


613
0:25:31,57 --> 0:25:35,48
He did kind of do
his own thing.


614
0:25:35,48 --> 0:25:38,36
And if you're trying to promote
an image, and you're


615
0:25:38,36 --> 0:25:41,52
trying to promote a wholesome
image, or you're trying to


616
0:25:41,52 --> 0:25:44,8
promote a healthy image, and
all of a sudden, you've got


617
0:25:44,8 --> 0:25:48,12
Farmer drunk, taking his clothes
off, jumping off


618
0:25:48,12 --> 0:25:51,72
something, or getting in a fight
or yelling at someone.


619
0:25:51,72 --> 0:25:55,34
Then that's a tough thing when
you're a company that has to


620
0:25:55,34 --> 0:25:57,99
justify results to a board--


621
0:25:57,99 --> 0:26:1,35
people that don't understand
the nature of the sport.


622
0:26:1,35 --> 0:26:4,75
And I think that's where he
got into some problems.


623
0:26:4,75 --> 0:26:6,7
That said, he had a
good run at it.


624
0:26:6,7 --> 0:26:7,4
He did get paid.


625
0:26:7,4 --> 0:26:9,1
He got paid well for a while.


626
0:26:9,1 --> 0:26:13,21
So for sure, someone believed
in him at some point.


627
0:26:13,21 --> 0:26:16,66
But he had different ideas
on things too.


628
0:26:16,66 --> 0:26:19,76
He didn't want to make the board
that was the all around


629
0:26:19,76 --> 0:26:20,4
everything board.


630
0:26:20,4 --> 0:26:22,66
He wanted to make a big board
that he could fly 100-foot


631
0:26:22,66 --> 0:26:23,89
cliffs off of.


632
0:26:23,89 --> 0:26:25,99
And there's a small amount
of the market


633
0:26:25,99 --> 0:26:28,17
that rides that way.


634
0:26:28,17 --> 0:26:29,43
SHAWN FARMER: I don't know what
the reason was, but man,


635
0:26:29,43 --> 0:26:30,47
boards were always breaking.


636
0:26:30,47 --> 0:26:34,3
Those things broke too, but
they just seemed have more


637
0:26:34,3 --> 0:26:37,75
life than a lot of stuff
that was out there.


638
0:26:37,75 --> 0:26:40,42
I just always thought-- and
I still like big boards.


639
0:26:40,42 --> 0:26:43,8
They're great for
certain things.


640
0:26:43,8 --> 0:26:48,36
It's kind of a lot of work,
is all, to ride one.


641
0:26:48,36 --> 0:26:49,265
JERRY DUGAN: The Farmer--


642
0:26:49,265 --> 0:26:52,94
the 185-centimeter Farmer board
made by Summit was not a


643
0:26:52,94 --> 0:26:55,43
board that everyone
was riding.


644
0:26:55,43 --> 0:26:57,55
That thing was great if you
wanted to drop an 80-fot


645
0:26:57,55 --> 0:26:59,98
cliff, and you had nice fresh
powder on the way in and


646
0:26:59,98 --> 0:27:3,33
powder on the way out, and you
had enough balls and muscle to


647
0:27:3,33 --> 0:27:4,84
turn the thing.


648
0:27:4,84 --> 0:27:7,43
But in his sort of theory,
it's like, no, no,


649
0:27:7,43 --> 0:27:9,25
that's what I want.


650
0:27:9,25 --> 0:27:11,32
He had a pretty good run
with K2 for a while.


651
0:27:11,32 --> 0:27:15,88
K2 had a bunch of boards under
his name that encompassed a


652
0:27:15,88 --> 0:27:18,3
broader riding style.


653
0:27:18,3 --> 0:27:21,3
SHAWN FARMER: I had a pretty
good run at it.


654
0:27:21,3 --> 0:27:23,1
I look back, and I'm just like,
I could've don this,


655
0:27:23,1 --> 0:27:25,73
this, and this different,
and maybe even


656
0:27:25,73 --> 0:27:27,1
still be up in there.


657
0:27:27,1 --> 0:27:31,15
But it's like, what are
you going to do, man?


658
0:27:31,15 --> 0:27:32,65
You're fricking snowboarding.


659
0:27:32,65 --> 0:27:33,9
What do you want?


660
0:27:33,9 --> 0:27:38,48



661
0:27:38,48 --> 0:27:41,13
HANNA TETER: I remember getting
asked to do that


662
0:27:41,13 --> 0:27:45,8
"First Descent" movie with Shawn
Farmer and Terje and


663
0:27:45,8 --> 0:27:46,49
Nick Perata.


664
0:27:46,49 --> 0:27:49,68
I'd never met Nick
or Shawn Farmer.


665
0:27:49,68 --> 0:27:52,17
It was New Year's before we
started filming that movie,


666
0:27:52,17 --> 0:27:54,6
and I met him at a bar.


667
0:27:54,6 --> 0:27:56,52
And I just thought he
was a sketchy dude.


668
0:27:56,52 --> 0:27:59,69
And I was like, I have to go on
a trip with this crazy guy


669
0:27:59,69 --> 0:28:0,69
for three weeks.


670
0:28:0,69 --> 0:28:3,17
And I was all scared, but then
when I actually got out to the


671
0:28:3,17 --> 0:28:5,465
backcountry with them, and they
were just super chill,


672
0:28:5,465 --> 0:28:8,36
and made it, like, the best
experience of my life.


673
0:28:8,36 --> 0:28:11,67
I mean, Shawn is a
crazy, crazy man.


674
0:28:11,67 --> 0:28:14,8
And he can rap like no other.


675
0:28:14,8 --> 0:28:17,25
But he's a hell of
a snowboarder.


676
0:28:17,25 --> 0:28:18,14
SHAUN WHITE: I was impressed.


677
0:28:18,14 --> 0:28:21,21
I mean, I know he felt a little
overwhelmed when we


678
0:28:21,21 --> 0:28:23,71
built this massive jump out
there in the mountains,


679
0:28:23,71 --> 0:28:25,59
because it's not really
his style.


680
0:28:25,59 --> 0:28:33,5
But whatever myself and Travis
were doing on the jump, he was


681
0:28:33,5 --> 0:28:36,555
beating that tenfold on just
getting down these crazy runs


682
0:28:36,555 --> 0:28:37,7
on the mountain there.


683
0:28:37,7 --> 0:28:39,14
I was impressed.


684
0:28:39,14 --> 0:28:42,8
I was just blown away because he
looked at it so differently


685
0:28:42,8 --> 0:28:43,57
from the way I would
look at it.


686
0:28:43,57 --> 0:28:44,61
I'm like, oh, I want
to jump off that.


687
0:28:44,61 --> 0:28:47,156
He's like, no, I'm going to
creep down this ridge, then


688
0:28:47,156 --> 0:28:47,9
I'm going to cut over.


689
0:28:47,9 --> 0:28:53,52
And it was impressive to see
how he looks at it, because


690
0:28:53,52 --> 0:28:56,41
everybody sees something but
it's always different from


691
0:28:56,41 --> 0:28:58,865
what everybody else sees.


692
0:28:58,865 --> 0:29:0,66
SHAWN FARMER: I like big
mountain stuff, man.


693
0:29:0,66 --> 0:29:1,83
I really like slashes.


694
0:29:1,83 --> 0:29:3,97
I like doing airs.


695
0:29:3,97 --> 0:29:8,6
And I'm not super focused
on tricks.


696
0:29:8,6 --> 0:29:10,83
If I do a big grab or a big
method or a big back or


697
0:29:10,83 --> 0:29:14,7
something, and just a really
sweet line, I like to try to


698
0:29:14,7 --> 0:29:15,875
be relatively fluid.


699
0:29:15,875 --> 0:29:17,22
And I like to haul ass.


700
0:29:17,22 --> 0:29:20,49
I like speed a lot, like really
carrying a lot of


701
0:29:20,49 --> 0:29:23,935
speed, and just getting, like,
to that point, where


702
0:29:23,935 --> 0:29:24,83
I'm like, oh my god.


703
0:29:24,83 --> 0:29:27,63
I can't even turn anymore.


704
0:29:27,63 --> 0:29:32,69
I'm just not obsessed with
tricks or anything so much as


705
0:29:32,69 --> 0:29:34,44
I just like being out on

I don't have to try to do
a lot of craziness.


708

front of me, do a couple

things, get out there,
and keep going.

714
0:29:52,9 --> 0:29:55,64
Not to say there's not great
personalities out there.


715
0:29:55,64 --> 0:29:59,8
But Farmer's just one of those
guys that you just, you meet


716
0:29:59,8 --> 0:30:1,81
him and he sticks in
your head forever.


717

about the guy,


719
0:30:9,14 --> 0:30:9,91
you just know him.

And like I said, I wish there
was more people like that in

722
0:30:13,27 --> 0:30:14,97

he's an amazing person.
