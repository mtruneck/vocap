1
0:0:38,652 --> 0:0:39,886
This is it.


2
0:0:39,886 --> 0:0:41,488
l'm standing on the very spot


3
0:0:41,488 --> 0:0:44,691
where many Christians believe
the world will come to an end.


4
0:0:44,691 --> 0:0:46,493
lt's called Megiddo.


5
0:0:46,493 --> 0:0:48,962
And it's the place that
the Book of Revelation says


6
0:0:48,962 --> 0:0:51,131
Jesus Christ
will come down to


7
0:0:51,131 --> 0:0:54,301
to end the world and save
the people who believe in him.


8
0:0:54,301 --> 0:0:56,837
Now when Revelations
was written,


9
0:0:56,837 --> 0:0:59,806
only God had the capacity
to end the world,


10
0:0:59,806 --> 0:1:3,43
but now man does too,
because unfortunately,


11
0:1:3,43 --> 0:1:5,412
before man figured out
how to be rational


12
0:1:5,412 --> 0:1:8,348
or peaceful, he figured out
nuclear weapons


13
0:1:8,348 --> 0:1:10,951
and how to pollute
on a catastrophic scale.


14
0:1:10,951 --> 0:1:13,12
And if it's one thing
l hate more than prophecy,


15
0:1:13,12 --> 0:1:18,725
it's self-fulfilling prophecy.


16
0:1:18,725 --> 0:1:21,561
Sometimes in your search
for happiness,


17
0:1:21,561 --> 0:1:24,97
you ponder the meaning
of your life.


18
0:1:24,97 --> 0:1:26,767
Who am l?
How did l come to be?


19
0:1:26,767 --> 0:1:31,271
Death, and then what?


20
0:1:31,271 --> 0:1:33,974
l certainly honestly believe


21
0:1:33,974 --> 0:1:36,276
religion is detrimental


22
0:1:36,276 --> 0:1:38,278
to the progress
of humanity.


23
0:1:38,278 --> 0:1:40,781
You know, it's just selling
an invisible product.


24
0:1:40,781 --> 0:1:42,883
lt's too easy.


25
0:1:42,883 --> 0:1:45,952
These questions
about what happens when you die,


26
0:1:45,952 --> 0:1:49,556
they so freak people out


27
0:1:49,556 --> 0:1:52,259
that they will
just make up any story


28
0:1:52,259 --> 0:1:54,6
and cling to it.


29
0:1:54,6 --> 0:1:56,229
You know, things that they know


30
0:1:56,229 --> 0:1:59,65
can't be true,
people who are otherwise


31
0:1:59,65 --> 0:2:1,501
so rational about everything else,


32
0:2:1,501 --> 0:2:3,336
and then they believe that


33
0:2:3,336 --> 0:2:5,972
on Sunday
they're drinking the blood


34
0:2:5,972 --> 0:2:8,208
of a 2,000-year-old God.


35
0:2:8,208 --> 0:2:11,678
l can't--
that's a dissonance in my head.


36
0:2:11,678 --> 0:2:14,247
l can't-- l have to find out.


37
0:2:14,247 --> 0:2:41,675
l just have to find out.
l have to try.


38
0:2:41,675 --> 0:2:45,45
This is the Mount of Olives.
This is Jesus's footprints.


39
0:2:45,45 --> 0:2:52,986
We're here freezing our ass off.


40
0:2:52,986 --> 0:2:55,322
ls there anybody on the stage that


41
0:2:55,322 --> 0:3:0,727
- does not believe in evolution?
- Yeah.


42
0:3:0,727 --> 0:3:6,333
Hurry hurry hurry.


43
0:3:6,333 --> 0:3:9,803
- l like my hat.
- You look good too.


44
0:3:9,803 --> 0:3:11,471
Welcome to Bible Country!


45
0:3:11,471 --> 0:3:16,343
''Birthplace of the Virgin Mary''?


46
0:3:16,343 --> 0:3:19,145
l believe that God wants
everybody to be free.


47
0:3:19,145 --> 0:3:21,147
That's what l believe,


48
0:3:21,147 --> 0:3:27,53
and that's one part
of my foreign policy.


49
0:3:27,53 --> 0:3:32,559
Bill, watch out.


50
0:3:32,559 --> 0:3:40,2
Boy, do l feel cheap.


51
0:3:40,2 --> 0:3:42,402
l want to thank God
for just blessing me so much.


52
0:3:42,402 --> 0:3:44,371
Music has been
a blessing from God.


53
0:3:44,371 --> 0:3:46,439
Thank you, Jesus!


54
0:3:46,439 --> 0:4:0,453
You need a Holy Ghost enema
right up your rear end!


55
0:4:0,453 --> 0:4:2,756
The archives are there on the fifth
floor where you see the curtains.


56
0:4:2,756 --> 0:4:7,494
Yeah, put that away now.
Put that away.


57
0:4:7,494 --> 0:4:9,729
lf you look at my stand-up


58
0:4:9,729 --> 0:4:12,365
from like the '80s-- that era--


59
0:4:12,365 --> 0:4:15,468
early '90s,


60
0:4:15,468 --> 0:4:19,306
l talked about religion,
but l'm not ever questioning God.


61
0:4:19,306 --> 0:4:21,741
l'm just making fun
about things


62
0:4:21,741 --> 0:4:23,91
in the religion--
circumcision.


63
0:4:23,91 --> 0:4:25,712
Circumcision--
l mean, l would've loved


64
0:4:25,712 --> 0:4:29,149
to have been there for
the first people to hear about this.


65
0:4:29,149 --> 0:4:31,651
We're used to it now,
but you know, l mean,


66
0:4:31,651 --> 0:4:33,553
l'm sure when Moses came
down with this idea,


67
0:4:33,553 --> 0:4:35,989
there had to be one guy going,


68
0:4:35,989 --> 0:4:38,224
''Let me get this straight.''


69
0:4:38,224 --> 0:4:40,594
lt was just
a gentle poking fun at Him.


70
0:4:40,594 --> 0:4:42,562
lt's almost like
l'm roasting Him.


71
0:4:42,562 --> 0:4:45,265
My mother is Jewish and my father
is Catholic. That is the truth.


72
0:4:45,265 --> 0:4:47,67
l was raised Catholic formally,


73
0:4:47,67 --> 0:4:49,402
although l must say
the Jewish mind comes out


74
0:4:49,402 --> 0:4:51,671
even in the Catholic system.
l'll give you an example.


75
0:4:51,671 --> 0:4:53,473
We used to go into confession


76
0:4:53,473 --> 0:5:0,58
and l would bring
a lawyer in with me.


77
0:5:0,58 --> 0:5:2,916
You know.


78
0:5:2,916 --> 0:5:4,551
Bless me, Father,
for l have sinned.


79
0:5:4,551 --> 0:5:10,49
l think you know Mr. Cohen.


80
0:5:10,49 --> 0:5:13,46
So let me get out some pictures.


81
0:5:13,46 --> 0:5:15,328
There's me.


82
0:5:15,328 --> 0:5:17,597
We weren't brought up Jewish.


83
0:5:17,597 --> 0:5:20,767
l didn't even know
we had that side,


84
0:5:20,767 --> 0:5:22,836
so it was very Catholic.


85
0:5:22,836 --> 0:5:25,38
We went to church
every Sunday,


86
0:5:25,38 --> 0:5:27,34
but l wouldn't take off the gun


87
0:5:27,34 --> 0:5:29,109
and really when l think back,


88
0:5:29,109 --> 0:5:31,478
it wasn't relevant
to my life.


89
0:5:31,478 --> 0:5:35,148
Superman was relevant
and baseball.


90
0:5:35,148 --> 0:5:37,751
We had this family


91
0:5:37,751 --> 0:5:40,86
where one person
was Jewish


92
0:5:40,86 --> 0:5:43,223
and the other three
were Catholic.


93
0:5:43,223 --> 0:5:46,226
Now there it says
''A Sunday noon, fall '66,''


94
0:5:46,226 --> 0:5:49,863
so we must've
just gotten back from church,


95
0:5:49,863 --> 0:5:51,998
'cause l'm in a red suit


96
0:5:51,998 --> 0:5:54,968
and you're choking the dog.


97
0:5:54,968 --> 0:5:58,705
And l guess we got home from church
and took a picture with you.


98
0:5:58,705 --> 0:6:0,74
lt never occurred to me to say,


99
0:6:0,74 --> 0:6:1,975
''Why didn't you go to church?''


100
0:6:1,975 --> 0:6:3,343
Mom...


101
0:6:3,343 --> 0:6:6,12
what church do we belong to?


102
0:6:6,12 --> 0:6:8,148
l don't remember
this ever coming up.


103
0:6:8,148 --> 0:6:10,15
Of course you didn't go
to church with us.


104
0:6:10,15 --> 0:6:12,819
No, we never had a family
discussion about it, never.


105
0:6:12,819 --> 0:6:14,754
We never had
a family discussion about that.


106
0:6:14,754 --> 0:6:18,258
Every family is dysfunctional.


107
0:6:18,258 --> 0:6:21,594
So you thought even this,
which wasn't your religion,


108
0:6:21,594 --> 0:6:23,863
was better than no religion.


109
0:6:23,863 --> 0:6:27,267
Well, even this only
told you good things...


110
0:6:27,267 --> 0:6:28,902
l thought.


111
0:6:28,902 --> 0:6:32,105
But it's just so shamelessly
invented as they go along.


112
0:6:32,105 --> 0:6:35,742
- We can say that now.
- Was anyone--


113
0:6:35,742 --> 0:6:38,144
When we quit
the church, l was 1 3,


114
0:6:38,144 --> 0:6:41,581
and l was of course thrilled,
but not for any ideological reason.


115
0:6:41,581 --> 0:6:43,583
l was just thrilled
'cause l hated church.


116
0:6:43,583 --> 0:6:45,452
lt scared me.
lt was boring.


117
0:6:45,452 --> 0:6:47,353
l had to get up
on Sunday.


118
0:6:47,353 --> 0:6:48,988
l was 1 3.


119
0:6:48,988 --> 0:6:51,357
l would've worshiped anything
that could've allowed me


120
0:6:51,357 --> 0:6:54,227
to masturbate even more
than l was masturbating


121
0:6:54,227 --> 0:6:58,64
or get a girl. That god l would have
definitely worshipped.


122
0:6:58,64 --> 0:7:0,1
Why do you remember


123
0:7:0,1 --> 0:7:2,969
Dad stopped going to church?


124
0:7:2,969 --> 0:7:5,472
We used birth control,


125
0:7:5,472 --> 0:7:8,742
and the church frowned
on birth control.


126
0:7:8,742 --> 0:7:10,744
That was the biggest sin


127
0:7:10,744 --> 0:7:14,8
- you could ever commit.
- Right, that would--


128
0:7:14,8 --> 0:7:17,717
l think that was possibly--
he never said it to me.


129
0:7:17,717 --> 0:7:20,887
And he never went back.
None of us ever did.


130
0:7:20,887 --> 0:7:23,423
So now that we don't believe,


131
0:7:23,423 --> 0:7:25,91
where did--


132
0:7:25,91 --> 0:7:26,96
Nobody said we don't believe.


133
0:7:26,96 --> 0:7:31,197
We don't believe in Catholicism.


134
0:7:31,197 --> 0:7:34,434
Right, but what do
we believe in now?


135
0:7:34,434 --> 0:7:38,238
Come on.
You're my mother, instruct me.


136
0:7:38,238 --> 0:7:40,273
l don't know
the answer to that.


137
0:7:40,273 --> 0:7:41,741
That's my answer.


138
0:7:41,741 --> 0:7:45,11
We'll take some back roads to see


139
0:7:45,11 --> 0:7:47,28
- some interesting stuff out here.
- Take some back roads.


140
0:7:47,28 --> 0:7:49,649
We are heading toward Raleigh, right?


141
0:7:49,649 --> 0:8:14,44
Oh, yeah, man, can't you feel it?


142
0:8:14,44 --> 0:8:16,843
Do l stand up here?
So as l was going here,


143
0:8:16,843 --> 0:8:19,612
l just jotted down
a few questions that came to my mind.


144
0:8:19,612 --> 0:8:22,582
Are you ever bothered
by many things


145
0:8:22,582 --> 0:8:25,351
that are in Christianity
that are not in the Bible?


146
0:8:25,351 --> 0:8:28,54
Like original sin.


147
0:8:28,54 --> 0:8:29,823
lmmaculate conception.


148
0:8:29,823 --> 0:8:33,793
The virgin birth is only
in two of the Gospels-- popes.


149
0:8:33,793 --> 0:8:36,863
Are you worried that these things
came not from the founders,


150
0:8:36,863 --> 0:8:39,199
the people that wrote
this book, but from--


151
0:8:39,199 --> 0:8:41,367
and this is indisputable--
but from men,


152
0:8:41,367 --> 0:8:43,336
from human beings
who came after?


153
0:8:43,336 --> 0:8:48,41
And when l say men,
l mean people with penises.


154
0:8:48,41 --> 0:8:49,742
lf you wanna go back
to scientific proof,


155
0:8:49,742 --> 0:8:51,778
l think it was determined
the shroud or whatever that was


156
0:8:51,778 --> 0:8:53,346
went around a while back--
l didn't get involved.


157
0:8:53,346 --> 0:8:56,349
- Shroud of Turin?
- They took blood samples from it,


158
0:8:56,349 --> 0:8:58,418
and it was female blood
with a male figure.


159
0:8:58,418 --> 0:9:0,92
Okay, the only possible way
that could happen was


160
0:9:0,92 --> 0:9:4,23
that the Holy Ghost
impregnated Mary


161
0:9:4,23 --> 0:9:6,25
because it would've
been female blood


162
0:9:6,25 --> 0:9:10,53
because it would've been
the only blood flowing through her.


163
0:9:10,53 --> 0:9:12,632
- lt's a faith thing.
- But why is faith good?


164
0:9:12,632 --> 0:9:15,168
Why is believing something
without evidence good?


165
0:9:15,168 --> 0:9:16,936
l don't like the way
this thing's going.


166
0:9:16,936 --> 0:9:18,938
l don't know what
this documentary's supposed to be,


167
0:9:18,938 --> 0:9:20,573
but l don't like
where you're going.


168
0:9:20,573 --> 0:9:23,843
You start disputing my God,


169
0:9:23,843 --> 0:9:27,18
and you got a problem.
l don't know what you--


170
0:9:27,18 --> 0:9:33,353
l'm outta here. You do what
you wanna do, but l'm outta here.


171
0:9:33,353 --> 0:9:35,889
- l'm just asking questions.
- Okay, no problem.


172
0:9:35,889 --> 0:9:38,791
When l've seen what l've seen,
l know there's a God.


173
0:9:38,791 --> 0:9:41,728
You can't change my mind.
Nobody can change my mind.


174
0:9:41,728 --> 0:9:44,797
l walked for 30 years
as a Satanist priest.


175
0:9:44,797 --> 0:9:46,966
From the time l grew up,
l was in Satanism.


176
0:9:46,966 --> 0:9:49,469
For the last six years,
that l was into Satanism,


177
0:9:49,469 --> 0:9:51,604
l was a Satanist priest, okay?


178
0:9:51,604 --> 0:9:53,74
- Real Satanism?
- Yes, real Satanism.


179
0:9:53,74 --> 0:9:56,743
Being addicted to drugs,
and running prostitutes


180
0:9:56,743 --> 0:9:58,811
and the women
and everything that goes with that.


181
0:9:58,811 --> 0:10:1,214
l walked around with rolls
of money in my pocket.


182
0:10:1,214 --> 0:10:3,549
l gave all that up
when l got saved.


183
0:10:3,549 --> 0:10:5,618
When the guy said,
''Yeah, l used to do drugs.


184
0:10:5,618 --> 0:10:9,122
l used to have women,''
and l'm thinking,


185
0:10:9,122 --> 0:10:12,458
- ''And your problem was?''
- Right.


186
0:10:12,458 --> 0:10:13,793
Let me ask you this question:


187
0:10:13,793 --> 0:10:15,128
What if we're right
and you're wrong?


188
0:10:15,128 --> 0:10:17,463
We gonna make it
and you ain't.


189
0:10:17,463 --> 0:10:19,499
lf you're being good
just to save your ass


190
0:10:19,499 --> 0:10:21,834
just because,
''Ooh, they might be right


191
0:10:21,834 --> 0:10:24,504
and l just want
to double down here


192
0:10:24,504 --> 0:10:26,839
and make sure that
when l get up to the pearly gates,


193
0:10:26,839 --> 0:10:28,875
that St. Peter doesn't say to me,


194
0:10:28,875 --> 0:10:30,843
'Sorry, asshole,
you had the wrong religion.


195
0:10:30,843 --> 0:10:32,946
Enjoy Hell, buh-bye.'''


196
0:10:32,946 --> 0:10:34,948
That's not a good reason,
and you know that.


197
0:10:34,948 --> 0:10:37,15
Come on, believe in Jesus.
What do you have to lose?


198
0:10:37,15 --> 0:10:39,185
lt's like the lotto.


199
0:10:39,185 --> 0:10:41,688
You can't get saved
if you don't play.


200
0:10:41,688 --> 0:10:44,424
Yeah, you could be right.
l don't think it's very likely,


201
0:10:44,424 --> 0:10:47,76
but, yes, you could be right,
because my big thing is l don't know.


202
0:10:47,76 --> 0:10:48,995
That's what l preach.


203
0:10:48,995 --> 0:10:52,31
l preach the gospel
of l don't know!


204
0:10:52,31 --> 0:10:54,5
l mean that's what
l'm here promoting-- doubt.


205
0:10:54,5 --> 0:10:55,902
- That's my product.
- Right.


206
0:10:55,902 --> 0:10:58,871
The other guys are
selling certainty, not me.


207
0:10:58,871 --> 0:11:0,84
l'm on the corner
with doubt.


208
0:11:0,84 --> 0:11:2,442
So, Dr. Collins,


209
0:11:2,442 --> 0:11:4,911
you are a brilliant
brilliant scientist,


210
0:11:4,911 --> 0:11:7,513
the head
of the Human Genome Project.


211
0:11:7,513 --> 0:11:10,75
Now here's what's
so puzzling is that you are


212
0:11:10,75 --> 0:11:12,518
the one scientist--


213
0:11:12,518 --> 0:11:14,287
the one famous scientist anyway--


214
0:11:14,287 --> 0:11:17,123
who's also religious.
Explain that to me.


215
0:11:17,123 --> 0:11:19,325
l would argue that
if you look at the evidence,


216
0:11:19,325 --> 0:11:23,129
the historical evidence
of Christ's existence is overwhelming.


217
0:11:23,129 --> 0:11:24,998
What evidence?


218
0:11:24,998 --> 0:11:28,534
l mean, l've never even heard
anyone propose that there's evidence.


219
0:11:28,534 --> 0:11:30,303
There's been proof
that there's a Jesus.


220
0:11:30,303 --> 0:11:32,638
- That's been proven.
- That hasn't been proven.


221
0:11:32,638 --> 0:11:35,475
How you figure that one?


222
0:11:35,475 --> 0:11:36,976
When l read the New Testament,


223
0:11:36,976 --> 0:11:39,879
it reads to me
as the record of eyewitnesses


224
0:11:39,879 --> 0:11:41,247
who put down what they saw.


225
0:11:41,247 --> 0:11:43,349
You know
they weren't eyewitnesses.


226
0:11:43,349 --> 0:11:45,418
- They were close to that.
- No.


227
0:11:45,418 --> 0:11:48,187
Within a couple
of decades of eyewitnesses.


228
0:11:48,187 --> 0:11:51,157
- Okay.
- Would that stand up in a laboratory


229
0:11:51,157 --> 0:11:54,46
as absolute foolproof evidence


230
0:11:54,46 --> 0:11:56,62
that something happened?


231
0:11:56,62 --> 0:11:58,531
You are setting up
a standard for proof


232
0:11:58,531 --> 0:12:1,868
that l think would really be
an almost impossible standard to meet.


233
0:12:1,868 --> 0:12:5,438
No gospel tells us what he was
doing when he was a young man.


234
0:12:5,438 --> 0:12:7,673
You know,
we see Jesus as an infant


235
0:12:7,673 --> 0:12:11,277
and then we kind of pick up
the story when he's 30.


236
0:12:11,277 --> 0:12:13,613
l think Jesus was probably
an awkward teenager--


237
0:12:13,613 --> 0:12:16,883
big Jewfro,
bad at sports.


238
0:12:16,883 --> 0:12:19,285
Here l am!


239
0:12:19,285 --> 0:12:21,921
The records we have
are all gospels.


240
0:12:21,921 --> 0:12:24,9
Gospels are not history.


241
0:12:24,9 --> 0:12:27,26
Gospel writers never met Jesus,
neither did St. Paul.


242
0:12:27,26 --> 0:12:29,295
No one who wrote
about Jesus ever met him.


243
0:12:29,295 --> 0:12:31,297
How can you go back
into the prophets


244
0:12:31,297 --> 0:12:33,466
and the prophets specifically
specifies that certain things--


245
0:12:33,466 --> 0:12:35,34
Well, first of all,


246
0:12:35,34 --> 0:12:37,603
the New Testament came after
the Old Testament. We agree to that?


247
0:12:37,603 --> 0:12:39,872
l agree to that,
but that doesn't mean anything.


248
0:12:39,872 --> 0:12:42,108
All it means is the people that
wrote the New Testament


249
0:12:42,108 --> 0:12:45,545
read the Old Testament
and then made the prophesies fit.


250
0:12:45,545 --> 0:12:47,146
They can't make it fit
if something didn't happen.


251
0:12:47,146 --> 0:12:48,815
Of course they can.


252
0:12:48,815 --> 0:12:51,5
Then you're saying
the Bible is fictitious?


253
0:12:51,5 --> 0:12:52,718
- l am.
- Can't be.


254
0:12:52,718 --> 0:12:54,287
l am.


255
0:12:54,287 --> 0:12:56,489
We do all know that
those texts don't match.


256
0:12:56,489 --> 0:12:58,558
Yeah, sure.
Would you expect them to?


257
0:12:58,558 --> 0:13:1,661
l'm surprised that things
that are very important to the story


258
0:13:1,661 --> 0:13:4,297
like the virgin birth
isn't in all four of them.


259
0:13:4,297 --> 0:13:7,7
Wouldn't you really expect
that kind of discordance when you're


260
0:13:7,7 --> 0:13:10,503
thinking about the way in which
these documents came into being?


261
0:13:10,503 --> 0:13:13,639
But you'd think if you were
one of Christ's biographers,


262
0:13:13,639 --> 0:13:17,31
that would be sort
of an important thing not to leave out.


263
0:13:17,31 --> 0:13:20,48
Oh, God,
he was also born of a virgin.


264
0:13:20,48 --> 0:13:22,748
They don't notice the virgin birth.


265
0:13:22,748 --> 0:13:26,752
You know, l think that is something
if you were any sort of reporter


266
0:13:26,752 --> 0:13:28,654
you'd put into the story.


267
0:13:28,654 --> 0:13:32,458
What editor looks at the facts and goes,
''Yeah, but take out the thing


268
0:13:32,458 --> 0:13:36,195
about the virgin birth.
That's not interesting.''


269
0:13:36,195 --> 0:13:38,364
l think being without faith


270
0:13:38,364 --> 0:13:40,6
is something that's a luxury


271
0:13:40,6 --> 0:13:42,735
for people who were
fortunate enough


272
0:13:42,735 --> 0:13:44,604
to have a fortunate life.


273
0:13:44,604 --> 0:13:46,205
You know, you go to prison


274
0:13:46,205 --> 0:13:48,474
and you hear a guy say,
''You know what, buddy?


275
0:13:48,474 --> 0:13:50,109
l got nothing but Jesus in here.''


276
0:13:50,109 --> 0:13:52,445
l completely understand that.


277
0:13:52,445 --> 0:13:55,715
l think not having faith
is a luxury sometimes.


278
0:13:55,715 --> 0:13:58,651
lf you're in a foxhole,
you probably have a lot of faith, right?


279
0:13:58,651 --> 0:14:0,453
- Mm-hmm.
- So l get that.


280
0:14:0,453 --> 0:14:3,222
But you guys aren't dumb.
You're smart people.


281
0:14:3,222 --> 0:14:4,79
How can smart people--


282
0:14:4,79 --> 0:14:7,293
how can they believe
in the talking snake,


283
0:14:7,293 --> 0:14:10,29
people living to 900 years old
and the virgin birth?


284
0:14:10,29 --> 0:14:12,198
And you know,
that's my question.


285
0:14:12,198 --> 0:14:13,799
You guys have
your own questions.


286
0:14:13,799 --> 0:14:15,368
Pray for me.


287
0:14:15,368 --> 0:14:18,137
Father, in the name of Jesus
and by the power of the Holy Spirit,


288
0:14:18,137 --> 0:14:20,373
we ask right now, Lord,
as we lift up Bill to You, Father,


289
0:14:20,373 --> 0:14:23,242
that You can answer his questions
that we can't answer.


290
0:14:23,242 --> 0:14:25,244
Father, we thank You
right now for the opportunity


291
0:14:25,244 --> 0:14:27,413
that has come today,


292
0:14:27,413 --> 0:14:30,82
that we may voice
our opinions and hear others.


293
0:14:30,82 --> 0:14:31,784
So we ask You, Lord, to touch


294
0:14:31,784 --> 0:14:34,787
and feel wisdom right now
in the name of Jesus.


295
0:14:34,787 --> 0:14:36,889
And we thank You for it
in Jesus's name, amen.


296
0:14:36,889 --> 0:14:40,92
Thank you for being Christlike,
and not just Christian.


297
0:14:40,92 --> 0:14:43,529
Okay. Hey, my wallet!


298
0:14:43,529 --> 0:14:46,332
No, l'm kidding.


299
0:14:46,332 --> 0:14:50,169
You see so many nice people
trying to make it about


300
0:14:50,169 --> 0:14:51,938
something good


301
0:14:51,938 --> 0:14:54,507
and yet it turns
into not just corrupt,


302
0:14:54,507 --> 0:14:57,743
but, like, fucking-little-kids corrupt


303
0:14:57,743 --> 0:15:0,146
and burning-people-alive cor--


304
0:15:0,146 --> 0:15:2,715
l mean, really evil shit.


305
0:15:2,715 --> 0:15:5,551
l'd like to see 10,000 people


306
0:15:5,551 --> 0:15:7,86
give $10,000.


307
0:15:7,86 --> 0:15:9,589
Write your biggest check
and send it in.


308
0:15:9,589 --> 0:15:12,425
We got people on welfare that's got
enough faith to make a $1,000 vow


309
0:15:12,425 --> 0:15:18,231
- and paying it!
- l want to be in the green, Lord!


310
0:15:18,231 --> 0:15:21,767
What l'm about
to say is revelation.


311
0:15:21,767 --> 0:15:23,936
l got it on DVD.
And l have it on DVD.


312
0:15:23,936 --> 0:15:29,208
And you need to get this. Hallelujah!


313
0:15:29,208 --> 0:15:35,615
Hallelujah!


314
0:15:35,615 --> 0:15:37,55
Reverend.
ls that what l call you?


315
0:15:37,55 --> 0:15:39,952
No, just call me... doctor.


316
0:15:39,952 --> 0:15:42,88
- Doctor?
- Yeah.


317
0:15:42,88 --> 0:15:45,625
All right, Doc. First of all,
l have to tell you, when l heard that


318
0:15:45,625 --> 0:15:47,827
you were in Harold Melvin
and the Blue Notes,


319
0:15:47,827 --> 0:15:54,133
l was like, ''That's my man.''


320
0:15:54,133 --> 0:15:56,502
And it's funny,
because that lyric


321
0:15:56,502 --> 0:15:58,571
can be interpreted religiously.


322
0:15:58,571 --> 0:16:0,573
''lf you don't know me
by now.'' Right?


323
0:16:0,573 --> 0:16:2,341
l mean, you must've thought of that.


324
0:16:2,341 --> 0:16:6,479
The song did go platinum.


325
0:16:6,479 --> 0:16:8,481
Teddy Pendergrass,
who led the song,


326
0:16:8,481 --> 0:16:11,17
he was ordained a minister
when he was 10 years old.


327
0:16:11,17 --> 0:16:13,419
What do you think
it says about religion


328
0:16:13,419 --> 0:16:15,388
and how serious it is


329
0:16:15,388 --> 0:16:20,76
if you can be a minister
when you're 10?


330
0:16:20,76 --> 0:16:24,363
But there is a comparison
to be made between


331
0:16:24,363 --> 0:16:26,599
musical stars, rock stars


332
0:16:26,599 --> 0:16:28,968
and religious figures.
They very often both dress


333
0:16:28,968 --> 0:16:31,27
- in elaborate costumes...
- Mm-hmm.


334
0:16:31,27 --> 0:16:46,886
...that get people's attention.


335
0:16:46,886 --> 0:16:48,487
People in a congregation


336
0:16:48,487 --> 0:16:50,856
must know that
the outfit was financed


337
0:16:50,856 --> 0:16:53,859
by their donations,
and it doesn't seem to bother them.


338
0:16:53,859 --> 0:16:55,961
l always dress well.


339
0:16:55,961 --> 0:16:58,197
l see! Are those gators?


340
0:16:58,197 --> 0:16:59,832
Those are lizards.


341
0:16:59,832 --> 0:17:1,534
- Lizards?
- Yes.


342
0:17:1,534 --> 0:17:6,739
- What do they run?
- They don't run. They crawl.


343
0:17:6,739 --> 0:17:8,841
And l see you got a lot of bling.


344
0:17:8,841 --> 0:17:12,678
l like gold.
The people want you to look well.


345
0:17:12,678 --> 0:17:14,68
That's what pimps say
about their women.


346
0:17:14,68 --> 0:17:18,5
l was told by one of the greatest pimps
that ever lived--


347
0:17:18,5 --> 0:17:21,387
his name is called God--


348
0:17:21,387 --> 0:17:22,555
that if you know what you got,


349
0:17:22,555 --> 0:17:24,557
then you ain't got much.


350
0:17:24,557 --> 0:17:26,492
Jesus dressed very well.


351
0:17:26,492 --> 0:17:28,594
Oh, come on.


352
0:17:28,594 --> 0:17:30,93
- Where is the Biblical evidence?
- Wait a minute.


353
0:17:30,93 --> 0:17:33,165
When he was born,
they brought him gold.


354
0:17:33,165 --> 0:17:35,668
They brought him gold.
He was not poor.


355
0:17:35,668 --> 0:17:38,137
So my image of Jesus as a man


356
0:17:38,137 --> 0:17:40,206
who championed the poor
and walked around


357
0:17:40,206 --> 0:17:43,676
in simple garb, that's wrong?


358
0:17:43,676 --> 0:17:45,845
lt was linen.
lt was fine linen.


359
0:17:45,845 --> 0:17:47,413
- Really?
- Yeah.


360
0:17:47,413 --> 0:17:50,95
But Jesus constantly preaches
against rich people.


361
0:17:50,95 --> 0:17:53,386
The Bible does not speak
against being rich.


362
0:17:53,386 --> 0:17:56,122
- Jesus does. Very plainly.
- No no.


363
0:17:56,122 --> 0:17:59,291
Jesus was very
very against the rich.


364
0:17:59,291 --> 0:18:2,595
He never preached against being poor.
Blessed are the poor in spirit, for--


365
0:18:2,595 --> 0:18:4,43
No, he preached
against being rich.


366
0:18:4,43 --> 0:18:7,99
No no no, he said that
it's better for a rich man--


367
0:18:7,99 --> 0:18:10,603
than a rich man to enter--


368
0:18:10,603 --> 0:18:14,407
lt is easier for a camel to go
through the eye of a needle


369
0:18:14,407 --> 0:18:16,909
than for a rich man
to enter the Kingdom.


370
0:18:16,909 --> 0:18:20,579
Okay, but now things
like houses and cars


371
0:18:20,579 --> 0:18:23,115
and clothes and money,


372
0:18:23,115 --> 0:18:25,451
they come as a result


373
0:18:25,451 --> 0:18:27,653
of my seeking God first.


374
0:18:27,653 --> 0:18:29,655
l don't remember that


375
0:18:29,655 --> 0:18:31,29
in the New Testament specifically.


376
0:18:31,29 --> 0:18:33,359
But it's there. l remember it.


377
0:18:33,359 --> 0:18:34,927
The houses, the cars


378
0:18:34,927 --> 0:18:35,961
and the clothes, they'll come.


379
0:18:35,961 --> 0:18:39,298
Yeah, money comes,
money happens, you know.


380
0:18:39,298 --> 0:18:42,835
Well, money happens for you
because they're giving it up to you.


381
0:18:42,835 --> 0:18:45,137
You're not giving it up to them.


382
0:18:45,137 --> 0:18:46,439
Let me set the record straight.


383
0:18:46,439 --> 0:18:48,641
l do not receive
a salary from the church.


384
0:18:48,641 --> 0:18:50,843
l do not take a salary
from the church.


385
0:18:50,843 --> 0:18:52,511
- You take it right out of the pot.
- No no no.


386
0:18:52,511 --> 0:18:54,313
lt's such a powerful position.


387
0:18:54,313 --> 0:18:56,582
l mean, you hold people's


388
0:18:56,582 --> 0:19:0,186
greatest hopes and dreams
in the palm of your hand, really.


389
0:19:0,186 --> 0:19:6,58
Certainly, some of the young women
must get a crush on you.


390
0:19:6,58 --> 0:19:9,128
Probably. l would too
if l was out there.


391
0:19:9,128 --> 0:19:11,897
lf l was a woman, l'd probably
have a crush on me, too.


392
0:19:11,897 --> 0:19:13,966
That's keepin' it real.


393
0:19:13,966 --> 0:19:17,703
Now l can advise other young men
about women, because l've been there.


394
0:19:17,703 --> 0:19:20,439
l had a young man who was
about to go crazy over a woman.


395
0:19:20,439 --> 0:19:22,141
He was about
to kill himself, you know?


396
0:19:22,141 --> 0:19:25,311
l said, ''That kind of passion,
you should have for God.''


397
0:19:25,311 --> 0:19:31,317
l said, ''Turn that to God
and see what happens.''


398
0:19:31,317 --> 0:19:35,321
St. Paul, for example,
whom l know you compare yourself to.


399
0:19:35,321 --> 0:19:37,389
People do.


400
0:19:37,389 --> 0:19:40,226
But he famously
only wore on his back


401
0:19:40,226 --> 0:19:42,661
the clothes that he owned.


402
0:19:42,661 --> 0:19:44,33
- Should l assume that this is--
- He was always on the run.


403
0:19:44,33 --> 0:19:48,33
This is your only $2,000 suit?


404
0:19:48,33 --> 0:19:50,135
The gentleman who made
this suit for me


405
0:19:50,135 --> 0:19:52,238
owns a clothing store.


406
0:19:52,238 --> 0:19:54,507
Mr. Kane, you in the house?


407
0:19:54,507 --> 0:19:57,309
The prices that l get
my clothes for--


408
0:19:57,309 --> 0:20:0,145
- you know, l'm blessed in that area.
- Yes, you are.


409
0:20:0,145 --> 0:20:3,916
l'm more blessed than
l've ever been all the days of my life.


410
0:20:3,916 --> 0:20:7,186
And the owner is a Muslim,
which-- l came out of lslam.


411
0:20:7,186 --> 0:20:10,956
l know, l think it's very interesting
that you're a Christian now,


412
0:20:10,956 --> 0:20:13,459
you were a Muslim
and when you get your clothes,


413
0:20:13,459 --> 0:20:17,196
you buy them like a Jew.


414
0:20:17,196 --> 0:20:19,732
And action!


415
0:20:19,732 --> 0:20:22,635
That's right-- behind me and above me
is the original Twin Cities,


416
0:20:22,635 --> 0:20:23,836
Sodom and Gomorrah.


417
0:20:23,836 --> 0:20:26,138
Apparently, it was
a pretty wicked place.


418
0:20:26,138 --> 0:20:27,873
How wicked?


419
0:20:27,873 --> 0:20:30,376
Well let's just say that
what happened in Gomorrah,


420
0:20:30,376 --> 0:20:36,415
stayed in Gomorrah.


421
0:20:36,415 --> 0:20:37,95
That is until God got wind of it,


422
0:20:37,95 --> 0:20:40,619
so he sent two angels
to investigate.


423
0:20:40,619 --> 0:20:42,621
Now the angels went to the house


424
0:20:42,621 --> 0:20:45,391
of the one godly man in town-- Lot.


425
0:20:45,391 --> 0:20:49,128
And the townspeople tried
to rape them.


426
0:20:49,128 --> 0:20:51,33
Now Lot,


427
0:20:51,33 --> 0:20:54,233
not wanting his town
to get the reputation


428
0:20:54,233 --> 0:20:57,903
as the kind of place
that would rape angels,


429
0:20:57,903 --> 0:21:1,574
offered up to the mob
his own daughters to rape.


430
0:21:1,574 --> 0:21:4,143
And he was
the good guy in town.


431
0:21:4,143 --> 0:21:6,245
Which brings me
to this question:


432
0:21:6,245 --> 0:21:9,548
lf l ever had to swear an oath,


433
0:21:9,548 --> 0:21:11,55
why would l want to put my hand


434
0:21:11,55 --> 0:21:14,62
on the King James Bible?


435
0:21:14,62 --> 0:21:21,6
l think l could find more morality
in the Rick James Bible.


436
0:21:21,6 --> 0:21:23,295
God hates fags.


437
0:21:23,295 --> 0:21:26,999
The Constitution does not
grant to homosexuals


438
0:21:26,999 --> 0:21:28,734
the right to perform sodomy.


439
0:21:28,734 --> 0:21:30,936
- l'm a monk.
- A monk.


440
0:21:30,936 --> 0:21:32,638
Franciscan.


441
0:21:32,638 --> 0:21:34,64
What do you think
of homosexuality?


442
0:21:34,64 --> 0:21:37,9
Do you think that's--
the Bible is against it.


443
0:21:37,9 --> 0:21:38,644
No, the Bible is not against it.


444
0:21:38,644 --> 0:21:40,646
The Bible's not
against homosexuality?


445
0:21:40,646 --> 0:21:43,716
lf you are born homosexual,
you are to stay there.


446
0:21:43,716 --> 0:21:46,352
- You have to be happy.
- But that's what the Bible says?


447
0:21:46,352 --> 0:21:49,21
What the Bible means to say, yeah.


448
0:21:49,21 --> 0:21:50,923
Oh, what the Bible means to say!


449
0:21:50,923 --> 0:21:53,25
Now that's a good book.


450
0:21:53,25 --> 0:21:55,16
lt preaches the rock-solid truth.


451
0:21:55,16 --> 0:21:56,695
You are faggots!


452
0:21:56,695 --> 0:22:0,99
l don't hate them.
God hates them.


453
0:22:0,99 --> 0:22:2,968
- Hey, Bill.
- How are you? Nice to meet you.


454
0:22:2,968 --> 0:22:5,871
Okay. Okay.


455
0:22:5,871 --> 0:22:9,341
So of course, the reason
why we're here is because you're--


456
0:22:9,341 --> 0:22:11,844
l guess we would say, ex-gay.


457
0:22:11,844 --> 0:22:13,812
You used to be gay


458
0:22:13,812 --> 0:22:16,649
and then you married someone
who used to be a lesbian.


459
0:22:16,649 --> 0:22:21,787
And you have three children,
and l guess the jury's out on them.


460
0:22:21,787 --> 0:22:25,357
Okay, and would you say
it's just like any other marriage


461
0:22:25,357 --> 0:22:27,559
of 14 years--
you never have sex?


462
0:22:27,559 --> 0:22:29,862
Oh, funny. Ha ha. Got that.


463
0:22:29,862 --> 0:22:33,532
l don't classify myself
as ex-gay, you know?


464
0:22:33,532 --> 0:22:35,868
l'm a heterosexual guy
who dealt


465
0:22:35,868 --> 0:22:39,471
with some homosexuality.


466
0:22:39,471 --> 0:22:42,608
Okay, so the people
who come here are people


467
0:22:42,608 --> 0:22:44,543
who are wanting to do what you did.


468
0:22:44,543 --> 0:22:48,547
They want to reform their life
and lead a heterosexual life.


469
0:22:48,547 --> 0:22:51,684
But l will be honest with you.
The reality's a lot of people come here


470
0:22:51,684 --> 0:22:54,653
and go right back
into whatever they came from.


471
0:22:54,653 --> 0:22:57,723
- Because they're gay!
- l believe that it's sin.


472
0:22:57,723 --> 0:23:1,56
Excuse me, but don't you have it,
no pun intended, ass-backwards?


473
0:23:1,56 --> 0:23:3,262
Meaning?


474
0:23:3,262 --> 0:23:5,998
Meaning homosexuality


475
0:23:5,998 --> 0:23:8,5
is something that occurs in nature.


476
0:23:8,5 --> 0:23:11,336
l was out bird watching,
but l'd rather watch you.


477
0:23:11,336 --> 0:23:12,938
Why don't you come over
and get some?


478
0:23:12,938 --> 0:23:16,241
Man is who wrote
the Bible.


479
0:23:16,241 --> 0:23:18,51
Nature made gay people.


480
0:23:18,51 --> 0:23:21,246
Nobody's born gay.
There's no scientific or--


481
0:23:21,246 --> 0:23:23,916
Really? Have you ever met
Little Richard?


482
0:23:23,916 --> 0:23:26,552
We can look at creation and say,
''What's the normal order?''


483
0:23:26,552 --> 0:23:28,754
A man has a penis.
A woman has a vagina.


484
0:23:28,754 --> 0:23:30,422
Let's just be blunt.


485
0:23:30,422 --> 0:23:32,758
There's no scientific
data that proves


486
0:23:32,758 --> 0:23:35,227
that anyone is--
there's no gay gene.


487
0:23:35,227 --> 0:23:37,62
And you also discovered
the gay gene?


488
0:23:37,62 --> 0:23:38,864
Yes.


489
0:23:38,864 --> 0:23:41,2
This is all coming from the Bible
which you believe...


490
0:23:41,2 --> 0:23:43,736
- Right.
- ...to be the word of God.


491
0:23:43,736 --> 0:23:46,4
- l do.
- All of the proscriptions


492
0:23:46,4 --> 0:23:49,608
against homosexuality come
from the Old Testament.


493
0:23:49,608 --> 0:23:52,77
Jesus never said a word
about homosexuality.


494
0:23:52,77 --> 0:23:54,313
And if it's so important,
why didn't he ever bring it up?


495
0:23:54,313 --> 0:23:57,182
We could pick lots of little things


496
0:23:57,182 --> 0:23:59,184
that he didn't
specifically talk about.


497
0:23:59,184 --> 0:24:2,988
- But this is a big thing.
- Let me stop this whole thing.


498
0:24:2,988 --> 0:24:5,958
You know, l'm not sure what
your documentary is about,


499
0:24:5,958 --> 0:24:9,962
but if it's to basically refute
the word of God,


500
0:24:9,962 --> 0:24:12,898
then l'm not interested
in doing your interview, okay?


501
0:24:12,898 --> 0:24:15,334
- Well, l--
- l think that


502
0:24:15,334 --> 0:24:17,436
obviously you don't have
the same relationship


503
0:24:17,436 --> 0:24:19,438
with Jesus Christ that l do.


504
0:24:19,438 --> 0:24:23,275
But what is your explanation
for the millions and millions of people


505
0:24:23,275 --> 0:24:24,91
around the world who are


506
0:24:24,91 --> 0:24:27,112
- leading homosexual lives...
- Well, it's not millions.


507
0:24:27,112 --> 0:24:31,116
...have no interest in anyone
of the opposite sex?


508
0:24:31,116 --> 0:24:33,685
Are they all faking
just to piss off Jesus?


509
0:24:33,685 --> 0:24:36,121
They didn't choose this.
They didn't desire it.


510
0:24:36,121 --> 0:24:37,656
Right, they were born gay.


511
0:24:37,656 --> 0:24:39,625
No, they weren't born that way.


512
0:24:39,625 --> 0:24:42,828
lt's because of the insecurity
within theirselves.


513
0:24:42,828 --> 0:24:46,431
lt takes a lot of security to walk out
of the house with assless chaps.


514
0:24:46,431 --> 0:24:49,868
- They're not happy, most of them.
- They're called gay.


515
0:24:49,868 --> 0:24:51,47
They took the word.


516
0:24:51,47 --> 0:24:59,278
Some of them look positively thrilled.


517
0:24:59,278 --> 0:25:1,88
No, they are people who
are really not complete


518
0:25:1,88 --> 0:25:3,515
in who they are
as men or women.


519
0:25:3,515 --> 0:25:6,485
That's a pretty big judgment
for a Christian.


520
0:25:6,485 --> 0:25:8,487
- lt's not a judgment.
- That's not a judgment?


521
0:25:8,487 --> 0:25:10,823
That you are sitting here
telling these people


522
0:25:10,823 --> 0:25:13,425
who you don't even know
that they're incomplete


523
0:25:13,425 --> 0:25:14,96
because they're not like you?


524
0:25:14,96 --> 0:25:17,629
l mean, it's not the people you suspect


525
0:25:17,629 --> 0:25:19,231
that are gay, that are gay.


526
0:25:19,231 --> 0:25:21,867
People like
the Reverend Ted Haggard...


527
0:25:21,867 --> 0:25:24,203
Moral purity is better than immorality.


528
0:25:24,203 --> 0:25:27,706
...who kept meeting
homosexual prostitutes in a hotel room


529
0:25:27,706 --> 0:25:31,31
and having gay sex with speed.


530
0:25:31,31 --> 0:25:35,881
Evangelicals have the best
sex life of any other group.


531
0:25:35,881 --> 0:25:38,5
- Good Morning, Duane!
- But he wasn't gay?


532
0:25:38,5 --> 0:25:39,985
l already answered that.


533
0:25:39,985 --> 0:25:42,154
l don't believe that
anybody is gay.


534
0:25:42,154 --> 0:25:44,957
l don't know,
but honestly, if l just saw you


535
0:25:44,957 --> 0:25:48,66
in a bar or something, l would say--
and don't take this the wrong way--


536
0:25:48,66 --> 0:25:50,929
l would say, ''Yeah,
l think that guy is gay.''


537
0:25:50,929 --> 0:25:54,166
You're good looking.
You're neat, you know.


538
0:25:54,166 --> 0:25:56,869
- You don't look like me.
- Meaning?


539
0:25:56,869 --> 0:26:21,293
Meaning...


540
0:26:21,293 --> 0:26:23,262
- All right, thank you.
- Can l give you a hug?


541
0:26:23,262 --> 0:26:24,563
- Yes!
- l hug everybody,


542
0:26:24,563 --> 0:26:27,366
so can l give you a hug?


543
0:26:27,366 --> 0:26:29,368
- Thanks.
- Thank you very much.


544
0:26:29,368 --> 0:26:31,37
Hey, you didn't have
a hard-on there, did you?


545
0:26:31,37 --> 0:26:36,141
Nope, sorry. Can't do that.


546
0:26:36,141 --> 0:26:38,644
That was good, though.


547
0:26:38,644 --> 0:26:42,47
When l was 17,
my first girlfriend dumped me,


548
0:26:42,47 --> 0:26:45,417
and l was sad in a way
l'd never been sad.


549
0:26:45,417 --> 0:26:48,287
You know,
your first dumping is the worst.


550
0:26:48,287 --> 0:26:50,589
And at that point,
you're very vulnerable


551
0:26:50,589 --> 0:26:53,692
to any sort of connection


552
0:26:53,692 --> 0:26:55,56
with, you know--


553
0:26:55,56 --> 0:26:58,163
l didn't get like Jesus-religious,


554
0:26:58,163 --> 0:27:0,632
but l did think a force out there


555
0:27:0,632 --> 0:27:3,936
was communicating to me
through song lyrics or--


556
0:27:3,936 --> 0:27:7,339
numerology l was
very interested in for a while.


557
0:27:7,339 --> 0:27:11,243
You said you were groping
for something at that time.


558
0:27:11,243 --> 0:27:13,712
You know, you make up
an imaginary friend who loves you,


559
0:27:13,712 --> 0:27:16,114
is sympathetic to you
and has a plan for you.


560
0:27:16,114 --> 0:27:19,518
lt's much more important.
He didn't have to love me, God,


561
0:27:19,518 --> 0:27:21,52
He just had
to be working for me.


562
0:27:21,52 --> 0:27:23,88
You know, He's like an agent.


563
0:27:23,88 --> 0:27:25,824
So you are an ex-Jew for Jesus.


564
0:27:25,824 --> 0:27:27,326
That is correct.


565
0:27:27,326 --> 0:27:31,263
Now what made you to decide
to be a follower of Christ?


566
0:27:31,263 --> 0:27:33,598
What brought Christ
into your life?


567
0:27:33,598 --> 0:27:36,868
Back in '75,


568
0:27:36,868 --> 0:27:38,937
l went to Michigan
State University.


569
0:27:38,937 --> 0:27:42,374
- $2,700?
- Yeah, it's pricey.


570
0:27:42,374 --> 0:27:45,11
Boy, l wonder what Madonna
without the child runs you.


571
0:27:45,11 --> 0:27:47,813
So getting back to my story,
l could ask God


572
0:27:47,813 --> 0:27:50,716
to do things in the name
of Jesus and they would happen.


573
0:27:50,716 --> 0:27:54,119
So l can't even recall
all the little miracles He did,


574
0:27:54,119 --> 0:27:57,556
but He proved to me that
He was real and He was there.


575
0:27:57,556 --> 0:28:0,325
They were so miraculous
and you can't remember what they were?


576
0:28:0,325 --> 0:28:1,994
There were so many of them
and they were little things.


577
0:28:1,994 --> 0:28:4,83
- Give me an example.
- One example l can remember was


578
0:28:4,83 --> 0:28:6,131
l was at a party.


579
0:28:6,131 --> 0:28:8,834
There was a guy who was working
with Jews for Jesus,


580
0:28:8,834 --> 0:28:12,17
and l asked him,
''Can l get a drink of water?''


581
0:28:12,17 --> 0:28:15,73
And he says,
''You know what? Here's a glass,


582
0:28:15,73 --> 0:28:18,343
stick your hand out the window
and pray for rain.''


583
0:28:18,343 --> 0:28:19,878
l didn't like the attitude.


584
0:28:19,878 --> 0:28:21,446
l said okay,


585
0:28:21,446 --> 0:28:24,616
and l stuck my hand out the window
and it started pouring rain.


586
0:28:24,616 --> 0:28:28,387
Pouring so bad that people
couldn't leave the party.


587
0:28:28,387 --> 0:28:30,655
To me, that's a miracle.
You don't have to believe it,


588
0:28:30,655 --> 0:28:33,825
- but l know between me and God--
- lt is pretty lame.


589
0:28:33,825 --> 0:28:36,628
- But you asked.
- l asked, but l'm just saying


590
0:28:36,628 --> 0:28:39,598
- that's my reaction to your answer.
- But that's just one of many things.


591
0:28:39,598 --> 0:28:41,7
l live a life of miracles.


592
0:28:41,7 --> 0:28:45,604
No, you live your life with the same
sort of mundane coincidences


593
0:28:45,604 --> 0:28:47,472
that happen to everybody
in the world.


594
0:28:47,472 --> 0:28:51,309
lt's not like,
you know, if it rained frogs,


595
0:28:51,309 --> 0:28:52,978
l would say you had a point.


596
0:28:52,978 --> 0:28:54,98
But it rains, and it stops raining.


597
0:28:54,98 --> 0:28:57,182
Well, when was the last time
you asked for rain


598
0:28:57,182 --> 0:28:58,817
and it starting raining
within 10 seconds?


599
0:28:58,817 --> 0:29:0,652
l don't know.
l don't ever ask for rain.


600
0:29:0,652 --> 0:29:2,954
But if l asked for it really bad
and it started to rain,


601
0:29:2,954 --> 0:29:4,489
l wouldn't think it was
because l asked for it.


602
0:29:4,489 --> 0:29:6,925
l would think
because it sometimes rains.


603
0:29:6,925 --> 0:29:9,461
God is not that busy


604
0:29:9,461 --> 0:29:11,563
where He can't spend time
listening to you


605
0:29:11,563 --> 0:29:13,432
when you really want
to talk to Him, anytime.


606
0:29:13,432 --> 0:29:16,34
lf Santa Claus can hit
every house in the world


607
0:29:16,34 --> 0:29:18,203
- in one night--
- l don't believe in Santa Claus.


608
0:29:18,203 --> 0:29:21,173
Of course not, that's ridiculous.
That's one man flying


609
0:29:21,173 --> 0:29:23,775
all around the world and dropping
presents down a chimney.


610
0:29:23,775 --> 0:29:26,578
That's ridiculous.
One man hearing everybody murmur


611
0:29:26,578 --> 0:29:30,682
to him at the same time, that l get.


612
0:29:30,682 --> 0:29:33,85
And you know what else
was very confusing to me?


613
0:29:33,85 --> 0:29:35,12
l remember vividly


614
0:29:35,12 --> 0:29:38,56
was Santa Claus


615
0:29:38,56 --> 0:29:40,959
- and Jesus.
- You were so mad at us.


616
0:29:40,959 --> 0:29:43,995
- Oh, yes.
- So mad at you, why? Oh, when--


617
0:29:43,995 --> 0:29:47,99
When you realized there
was no Santa Claus.


618
0:29:47,99 --> 0:29:49,868
And then when l found out
there was no Jesus,


619
0:29:49,868 --> 0:29:52,404
boy, was l pissed.


620
0:29:52,404 --> 0:29:55,6
You spoke before in certitude.


621
0:29:55,6 --> 0:29:57,75
You're 100% sure
that after you die,


622
0:29:57,75 --> 0:29:59,344
you'll go to a better place.


623
0:29:59,344 --> 0:30:2,247
l know l'll be with God.
l'll be with Jesus.


624
0:30:2,247 --> 0:30:4,15
And that's a better place.


625
0:30:4,15 --> 0:30:6,651
Even if it was in a garbage can,


626
0:30:6,651 --> 0:30:8,653
which l know it won't be,
but even if it was,


627
0:30:8,653 --> 0:30:11,456
just the fact that
l'm with Jesus, to me, is good.


628
0:30:11,456 --> 0:30:13,592
- lt's a better place.
- lt's a better place.


629
0:30:13,592 --> 0:30:17,95
Then why don't you kill yourself?


630
0:30:17,95 --> 0:30:18,897
Because God still has
a mission for me here.


631
0:30:18,897 --> 0:30:20,132
Oh, l see.


632
0:30:20,132 --> 0:30:23,702
l'm thinking of Jonah.
God sent Jonah on a mission.


633
0:30:23,702 --> 0:30:26,605
When did the part of the story come
when Jonah lived in the whale?


634
0:30:26,605 --> 0:30:28,64
lt was a great fish.


635
0:30:28,64 --> 0:30:30,642
lt's one of my favorite
nonsense stories,


636
0:30:30,642 --> 0:30:32,844
Jonah living inside
of the whale.


637
0:30:32,844 --> 0:30:36,681
And their answer unfailingly is


638
0:30:36,681 --> 0:30:40,18
''The Bible doesn't say whale.
lt says big fish.''


639
0:30:40,18 --> 0:30:42,53
Oh, yeah, big fish,
that makes--


640
0:30:42,53 --> 0:30:45,49
l'm sorry l was obsessing
on that it was a whale. lt's a big fish.


641
0:30:45,49 --> 0:30:47,225
Of course you could live
for three days in a big fish.


642
0:30:47,225 --> 0:30:49,127
A tuna.


643
0:30:49,127 --> 0:30:52,264
They do it all the time in Japan.
They have tuna spas.


644
0:30:52,264 --> 0:30:55,534
You go for three days.
They pamper you, oils.


645
0:30:55,534 --> 0:30:58,904
You come out of that tuna
feeling fantastic.


646
0:30:58,904 --> 0:31:0,505
You smell like pussy,


647
0:31:0,505 --> 0:31:3,808
but you feel fantastic.


648
0:31:3,808 --> 0:31:6,678
This man lived inside
of a fish for three days?


649
0:31:6,678 --> 0:31:9,614
Miraculously, yes.


650
0:31:9,614 --> 0:31:12,184
Steve, Steve, Steve.


651
0:31:12,184 --> 0:31:13,952
You don't believe in miracles.


652
0:31:13,952 --> 0:31:16,655
- That doesn't mean they don't exist.
- Of course not!


653
0:31:16,655 --> 0:31:18,256
l'm not 10!


654
0:31:18,256 --> 0:31:20,225
He lived in a fish.


655
0:31:20,225 --> 0:31:22,928
Come on.


656
0:31:22,928 --> 0:31:26,198
Your bar on miracles is pretty low,
l gotta tell you, bro.


657
0:31:26,198 --> 0:31:28,266
Well, whatever.


658
0:31:28,266 --> 0:31:30,802
Two things that are
completely incompatible


659
0:31:30,802 --> 0:31:34,72
are Christianity
as Jesus taught it


660
0:31:34,72 --> 0:31:36,41
- and nationalism...
- Right. Exactly.


661
0:31:36,41 --> 0:31:39,344
...and yet people always
say God and country.


662
0:31:39,344 --> 0:31:42,13
Jesus would never--
you know,


663
0:31:42,13 --> 0:31:43,882
people who are
such good Christians--


664
0:31:43,882 --> 0:31:46,685
in one breath you'll hear them
say something like,


665
0:31:46,685 --> 0:31:48,62
''Well, you gotta take care
of your own first.


666
0:31:48,62 --> 0:31:51,389
l know people overseas have trouble,
but you gotta take''--


667
0:31:51,389 --> 0:31:55,293
that is not a message l can ever see
the Jesus in the Bible,


668
0:31:55,293 --> 0:32:2,434
even when he was
in a bad mood, would say.


669
0:32:2,434 --> 0:32:3,602
l'm gonna vote Bible.


670
0:32:3,602 --> 0:32:5,203
lt's time for God's people to come


671
0:32:5,203 --> 0:32:8,406
out of the closets,
out of the churches


672
0:32:8,406 --> 0:32:10,275
and change America!


673
0:32:10,275 --> 0:32:11,91
Unless you and l do
what God wants us to do,


674
0:32:11,91 --> 0:32:14,112
he'll go to some other country.


675
0:32:14,112 --> 0:32:16,481
God, forgive America!


676
0:32:16,481 --> 0:32:20,452
l would probably have to say yes,
that the Constitution established


677
0:32:20,452 --> 0:32:23,255
the United States of America
as a Christian nation.


678
0:32:23,255 --> 0:32:25,89
We have, of course,
''ln God We Trust'' on our money.


679
0:32:25,89 --> 0:32:27,92
The Senate will come to order.


680
0:32:27,92 --> 0:32:33,465
The chaplain will lead
the Senate in prayer.


681
0:32:33,465 --> 0:32:37,269
How did this country
get to be a Christian nation?


682
0:32:37,269 --> 0:32:39,771
l've read a lot of quotes
from all the Founding Fathers.


683
0:32:39,771 --> 0:32:41,539
There are a lot of quotes
that explicitly say


684
0:32:41,539 --> 0:32:55,654
we're not a Christian nation.


685
0:32:55,654 --> 0:32:58,23
And Jefferson's
a particularly interesting case.


686
0:32:58,23 --> 0:33:1,726
Didn't he write his own Bible
which divorced the New Testament


687
0:33:1,726 --> 0:33:4,996
from what he considered
the unnecessary magic,


688
0:33:4,996 --> 0:33:6,765
bells and whistles?


689
0:33:6,765 --> 0:33:8,867
He took the Gospels,


690
0:33:8,867 --> 0:33:10,935
took out all of Jesus's miracles


691
0:33:10,935 --> 0:33:12,771
and took out
all of Jesus's statements


692
0:33:12,771 --> 0:33:15,4
that claimed divinity,


693
0:33:15,4 --> 0:33:17,375
and put out a new book called
''The Faith and Moral Teachings


694
0:33:17,375 --> 0:33:18,843
of Jesus of Nazareth.''


695
0:33:18,843 --> 0:33:21,98
We tend to lionize these guys
and think of them all


696
0:33:21,98 --> 0:33:25,25
as the 1 2 Apostles
plus the Founding Fathers,


697
0:33:25,25 --> 0:33:27,552
like they're in the same
club or something.


698
0:33:27,552 --> 0:33:30,221
When in fact,
these men understood very well


699
0:33:30,221 --> 0:33:32,49
that there was a difference
between being Christian


700
0:33:32,49 --> 0:33:34,392
and being American.


701
0:33:34,392 --> 0:33:36,661
- Right.
- ln Jefferson's age, fewer people went


702
0:33:36,661 --> 0:33:39,531
to church less often.


703
0:33:39,531 --> 0:33:41,9
Do you think that there
are a lot of people


704
0:33:41,9 --> 0:33:44,903
who feel the way you do,
but are afraid to speak out?


705
0:33:44,903 --> 0:33:46,705
Absolutely. Are you kidding?


706
0:33:46,705 --> 0:33:50,141
Yes, l think it is
the great untapped minority


707
0:33:50,141 --> 0:33:51,876
in this country.


708
0:33:51,876 --> 0:33:53,445
ln the last survey,


709
0:33:53,445 --> 0:33:57,15
l think it was 16% of Americans


710
0:33:57,15 --> 0:34:0,85
who now say they are
absolutely unaffiliated


711
0:34:0,85 --> 0:34:2,721
with any religion,
don't want to be in a religion,


712
0:34:2,721 --> 0:34:4,522
just don't go near me
with religion.


713
0:34:4,522 --> 0:34:7,492
16% of the population is


714
0:34:7,492 --> 0:34:10,528
a huge minority.
lt's bigger than Jews,


715
0:34:10,528 --> 0:34:14,466
blacks, homosexuals,
NRA members,


716
0:34:14,466 --> 0:34:17,1
lots of people you could name
who have lobbies


717
0:34:17,1 --> 0:34:19,571
that get everything they want


718
0:34:19,571 --> 0:34:23,508
or are at least are in the debate.


719
0:34:23,508 --> 0:34:25,677
You want me to kinda angle
like this or straight ahead?


720
0:34:25,677 --> 0:34:27,912
Just as natural as possible to Bill.


721
0:34:27,912 --> 0:34:31,182
So you've described yourself
as an Evangelical Christian.


722
0:34:31,182 --> 0:34:34,686
You did a campaign ad where you said
the most important lessons in life


723
0:34:34,686 --> 0:34:37,622
are in this book right here,
meaning the Bible.


724
0:34:37,622 --> 0:34:41,393
Everyone in politics likes
to brag that they're a person of faith.


725
0:34:41,393 --> 0:34:44,62
Why is faith good?


726
0:34:44,62 --> 0:34:46,97
Faith has a way


727
0:34:46,97 --> 0:34:48,433
of softening people.


728
0:34:48,433 --> 0:34:51,736
For example, if you look at the
teachings of Jesus, he's very forgiving.


729
0:34:51,736 --> 0:34:53,838
He also said,
''lf a man doesn't abide in me,


730
0:34:53,838 --> 0:34:56,741
he is cast forth
as a branch and withers,


731
0:34:56,741 --> 0:35:0,345
and the branches are gathered,
thrown into the fire and burned.''


732
0:35:0,345 --> 0:35:3,748
Right. So?


733
0:35:3,748 --> 0:35:5,617
l do think, 'cause l'm a Christian,


734
0:35:5,617 --> 0:35:8,42
that Jesus is the way
to be reconciled.


735
0:35:8,42 --> 0:35:13,91
And l do believe
the actual literacy of that story.


736
0:35:13,91 --> 0:35:17,595
We'll let God sort out all the details
of that on Judgment Day.


737
0:35:17,595 --> 0:35:19,364
What about
the 10 Commandments?


738
0:35:19,364 --> 0:35:22,734
So many politicians talk
about the 10 Commandments.


739
0:35:22,734 --> 0:35:24,969
Are they really the 10 most


740
0:35:24,969 --> 0:35:27,405
- important moral--
- Are these the 10 suggestions?


741
0:35:27,405 --> 0:35:29,941
The 10 recommendations?


742
0:35:29,941 --> 0:35:32,343
But it's not really a wide list of 10.


743
0:35:32,343 --> 0:35:34,345
The first four are all


744
0:35:34,345 --> 0:35:37,682
about just worshipping God
and basically that he's a jealous God,


745
0:35:37,682 --> 0:35:39,851
and he doesn't want you
to have any other gods.


746
0:35:39,851 --> 0:35:41,986
The only two that are really laws


747
0:35:41,986 --> 0:35:44,22
are don't steal and don't kill.


748
0:35:44,22 --> 0:35:46,291
Why is this the wisest group of 10?


749
0:35:46,291 --> 0:35:50,28
lt doesn't include child abuse.
lt doesn't include don't torture.


750
0:35:50,28 --> 0:35:52,163
lt doesn't include
a lot of things-- rape--


751
0:35:52,163 --> 0:35:54,999
that l think if we were
making a list today,


752
0:35:54,999 --> 0:35:56,701
we would probably include.


753
0:35:56,701 --> 0:35:59,137
Society is so different today


754
0:35:59,137 --> 0:36:1,673
and our culture is
so radically different today.


755
0:36:1,673 --> 0:36:4,275
That's what l'm asking.
We're in a different culture.


756
0:36:4,275 --> 0:36:7,946
Can you think of anything else that
we still cleave to from the Bronze Age?


757
0:36:7,946 --> 0:36:28,833
Well...


758
0:36:28,833 --> 0:36:31,569
Basically, murder is against the law
in every country in the world.


759
0:36:31,569 --> 0:36:34,606
But wouldn't we have come
to that even without religion?


760
0:36:34,606 --> 0:36:37,342
Don't you think people would
have gotten together and said,


761
0:36:37,342 --> 0:36:39,477
''You know what?
Let's not slaughter each other


762
0:36:39,477 --> 0:36:43,214
- and not take each other's stuff.''
- l don't know.


763
0:36:43,214 --> 0:36:46,5
There's been more killing
in the name of ''My God.''


764
0:36:46,5 --> 0:36:49,521
You think maybe sort of indigously


765
0:36:49,521 --> 0:36:51,756
or just by our DNA,


766
0:36:51,756 --> 0:36:54,592
we somehow know that killing
another person is wrong?


767
0:36:54,592 --> 0:36:57,262
l'm not sure that that's the case.


768
0:36:57,262 --> 0:36:59,998
Really, you need God
to decide not to kill each other?


769
0:36:59,998 --> 0:37:3,434
Well, you can look back
at more primitive cultures,


770
0:37:3,434 --> 0:37:11,242
and they were constantly at war.


771
0:37:11,242 --> 0:37:14,746
We are now, among industrialized,
modern nations,


772
0:37:14,746 --> 0:37:17,15
the most religious nation.


773
0:37:17,15 --> 0:37:19,117
A recent study found that


774
0:37:19,117 --> 0:37:21,219
among 32 countries,


775
0:37:21,219 --> 0:37:23,855
more people in this country
doubted evolution


776
0:37:23,855 --> 0:37:27,625
than any other country on that list,
except, l think, it was Turkey.


777
0:37:27,625 --> 0:37:30,28
ln the US,
we have freedom of religion.


778
0:37:30,28 --> 0:37:32,363
l think most of the countries on
that list do have freedom of religion.


779
0:37:32,363 --> 0:37:34,299
Well, that's interesting.


780
0:37:34,299 --> 0:37:35,6
Do you believe in evolution?


781
0:37:35,6 --> 0:37:38,536
You know my-- l don't know.


782
0:37:38,536 --> 0:37:41,306
Clearly the scientific community's
a little divided


783
0:37:41,306 --> 0:37:44,709
on some of the specifics
of that and l understand that.


784
0:37:44,709 --> 0:37:47,579
- l don't think they are.
- No no-- well--


785
0:37:47,579 --> 0:37:49,647
l think they pretty much agree.


786
0:37:49,647 --> 0:37:51,516
l don't know how it all happened.


787
0:37:51,516 --> 0:37:54,586
l'm certainly willing to accept
the scientific premise.


788
0:37:54,586 --> 0:37:57,288
lt couldn't possibly
have been Adam and Eve


789
0:37:57,288 --> 0:38:0,458
5,000 years ago with a talking snake
and a garden, could it?


790
0:38:0,458 --> 0:38:2,16
Well, it could've
possibly been that.


791
0:38:2,16 --> 0:38:4,762
Come on.
See, this is my problem.


792
0:38:4,762 --> 0:38:7,131
l mean, you're a senator.


793
0:38:7,131 --> 0:38:9,467
You are one
of the very few people


794
0:38:9,467 --> 0:38:11,269
who are really
running this country.


795
0:38:11,269 --> 0:38:15,273
lt worries me that people are
running my country who think--


796
0:38:15,273 --> 0:38:16,941
who believe
in a talking snake.


797
0:38:16,941 --> 0:38:29,32
You don't have to pass an lQ test
to be in the Senate, though.


798
0:38:29,32 --> 0:38:32,156
As you first come
into the Creation Museum,


799
0:38:32,156 --> 0:38:33,658
there's going to be a sense


800
0:38:33,658 --> 0:38:35,426
of ''This is something really big.''


801
0:38:35,426 --> 0:38:38,563
This is something awe-inspiring,
something great here.


802
0:38:38,563 --> 0:38:41,65
We can answer the questions
of the skeptics


803
0:38:41,65 --> 0:38:42,834
that attack
the Bible's history.


804
0:38:42,834 --> 0:38:45,536
We admit that we start
from the Bible here


805
0:38:45,536 --> 0:38:47,105
to teach them how to think.


806
0:38:47,105 --> 0:38:49,307
Really, in a nutshell,
we're saying, the Bible's true


807
0:38:49,307 --> 0:38:56,14
from Genesis to Revelation.


808
0:38:56,14 --> 0:39:1,386
We're building the whole place
for about $27 million.


809
0:39:1,386 --> 0:39:2,987
l have many people say to me,


810
0:39:2,987 --> 0:39:4,922
''As a Christian,
can't you believe in evolution?''


811
0:39:4,922 --> 0:39:7,525
l say, ''Well, you got a problem.
God made a man and a woman.''


812
0:39:7,525 --> 0:39:10,328
lf you believe in evolution, the woman
had to come from an ape woman.


813
0:39:10,328 --> 0:39:15,7
All right,
but you're so damned ugly.


814
0:39:15,7 --> 0:39:19,504
This is what we call the main hall
here. lmmediately, people see


815
0:39:19,504 --> 0:39:21,339
dinosaurs and people together,
which is very different


816
0:39:21,339 --> 0:39:25,9
to the idea of the evolutionists
who say dinosaurs died out


817
0:39:25,9 --> 0:39:28,312
70 million ago or so,
and so they didn't live with humans.


818
0:39:28,312 --> 0:39:31,349
They see an animatronic
dinosaur over here.


819
0:39:31,349 --> 0:39:34,18
Two animatronic baby T-Rexes
and two animatronic children.


820
0:39:34,18 --> 0:39:41,659
lt's basically just to give people
a wow factor as they come in here.


821
0:39:41,659 --> 0:39:45,53
How to share your faith
effectively and Biblically,


822
0:39:45,53 --> 0:39:47,131
to be able to reason
with people,


823
0:39:47,131 --> 0:39:48,9
learn to circumnavigate


824
0:39:48,9 --> 0:39:50,935
or go around
the person's intellect.


825
0:39:50,935 --> 0:39:54,539
There's plenty of people who
would say, ''Well, it's just my faith.''


826
0:39:54,539 --> 0:39:57,275
But that's not good enough
for you. You say, ''No.


827
0:39:57,275 --> 0:39:59,777
We can basically
reconcile the science


828
0:39:59,777 --> 0:40:2,513
with what's in Genesis.''


829
0:40:2,513 --> 0:40:5,416
We're an organization that--
to put it in a nutshell--


830
0:40:5,416 --> 0:40:8,86
is telling people that
the Bible's history is true,


831
0:40:8,86 --> 0:40:9,42
its history beginning
in Genesis.


832
0:40:9,42 --> 0:40:12,857
Scientists line up
overwhelmingly


833
0:40:12,857 --> 0:40:15,93
on one side of this issue.
lt would have to be


834
0:40:15,93 --> 0:40:18,896
an enormous conspiracy
going on between scientists


835
0:40:18,896 --> 0:40:21,566
of all different disciplines
in all different countries


836
0:40:21,566 --> 0:40:24,235
to have such a consensus.


837
0:40:24,235 --> 0:40:25,803
That doesn't move you?


838
0:40:25,803 --> 0:40:28,339
No, not at all, because from
a Biblical perspective,


839
0:40:28,339 --> 0:40:31,609
l understand why the majority
would not agree with the truth.


840
0:40:31,609 --> 0:40:34,746
Man is a sinner.
Man is rebelling against his creator.


841
0:40:34,746 --> 0:40:37,648
All these scientists
are sinners?


842
0:40:37,648 --> 0:40:39,751
Well...


843
0:40:39,751 --> 0:40:42,92
We have been talking
to so many religious people


844
0:40:42,92 --> 0:40:45,389
and many of them believe
the earth is 5,000 years old.


845
0:40:45,389 --> 0:40:47,892
lf you're a scientist,
you can't accept that.


846
0:40:47,892 --> 0:40:51,262
Now you recently were the director
of the Vatican Observatory.


847
0:40:51,262 --> 0:40:53,464
A Vatican astronomer.


848
0:40:53,464 --> 0:40:56,434
lt's one of those terms
like ''gay Republican''--


849
0:40:56,434 --> 0:40:58,436
you know,
you just don't expect it.


850
0:40:58,436 --> 0:41:1,973
- l'm not getting into that.
- No no no, l'm not asking you to.


851
0:41:1,973 --> 0:41:4,8
lt's not that the church
has the idea, you know,


852
0:41:4,8 --> 0:41:7,311
they're gonna train us up
so we can be the first ones out there


853
0:41:7,311 --> 0:41:9,48
to baptize those extraterrestrials


854
0:41:9,48 --> 0:41:11,616
before the Mormons get at 'em.


855
0:41:11,616 --> 0:41:14,252
The reason is simply


856
0:41:14,252 --> 0:41:16,921
historical facts.


857
0:41:16,921 --> 0:41:20,158
John Paul ll,
for instance, said evolution


858
0:41:20,158 --> 0:41:24,162
in the neo-Darwinian sense is
no longer a mere hypothesis.


859
0:41:24,162 --> 0:41:26,497
l mean, he said that.
lt's in writing.


860
0:41:26,497 --> 0:41:29,33
l still don't understand
why it's important


861
0:41:29,33 --> 0:41:31,636
for there to have to have been
a situation on earth


862
0:41:31,636 --> 0:41:34,338
where a man co-existed
with dinosaurs.


863
0:41:34,338 --> 0:41:35,94
Only really
in ''The Flintstones''...


864
0:41:35,94 --> 0:41:37,942
ls someone talking about me?


865
0:41:37,942 --> 0:41:39,51
...and that Raquel Welch movie


866
0:41:39,51 --> 0:41:43,47
does man ever co-exist
with dinosaurs.


867
0:41:43,47 --> 0:41:46,984
Why is that important
for your salvation or your morality?


868
0:41:46,984 --> 0:41:48,753
lf you're saying
this part over here,


869
0:41:48,753 --> 0:41:51,556
it says God made land animals
and man on the same day is not true,


870
0:41:51,556 --> 0:41:54,692
then ultimately, why should
l believe this bit over here?


871
0:41:54,692 --> 0:41:58,462
The Christian Scriptures
were written


872
0:41:58,462 --> 0:42:1,299
between about 2,000 years
before Christ


873
0:42:1,299 --> 0:42:3,401
to about 200 years after Christ.


874
0:42:3,401 --> 0:42:4,635
That's it.


875
0:42:4,635 --> 0:42:8,139
Modern science came
to be with Galileo


876
0:42:8,139 --> 0:42:10,541
up through Newton,
up through Einstein.


877
0:42:10,541 --> 0:42:13,744
What we know
as modern science, okay,


878
0:42:13,744 --> 0:42:15,246
is in that period.


879
0:42:15,246 --> 0:42:18,616
How in the world could
there be any science


880
0:42:18,616 --> 0:42:20,384
in scripture?


881
0:42:20,384 --> 0:42:22,19
There cannot be.


882
0:42:22,19 --> 0:42:24,689
Just the two historical
periods are separated


883
0:42:24,689 --> 0:42:26,424
by so much.


884
0:42:26,424 --> 0:42:28,392
The Scriptures are not


885
0:42:28,392 --> 0:42:30,595
teaching science.


886
0:42:30,595 --> 0:42:32,597
lt's very hard for me to accept,


887
0:42:32,597 --> 0:42:36,167
not just a literal interpretation
of scripture,


888
0:42:36,167 --> 0:42:39,3
but a fundamentalist approach
to religious belief.


889
0:42:39,3 --> 0:42:40,905
lt's kind of a plague.


890
0:42:40,905 --> 0:42:43,674
lt presents itself
as science and it's not.


891
0:42:43,674 --> 0:42:46,1
God is an infinite God
who is working in ways


892
0:42:46,1 --> 0:42:48,679
- we don't always understand.
- You don't think that's a cop-out?


893
0:42:48,679 --> 0:42:51,382
He is God.


894
0:42:51,382 --> 0:42:54,518
Are you God?


895
0:42:54,518 --> 0:42:59,757
No.


896
0:42:59,757 --> 0:43:1,592
We went to church every Sunday.


897
0:43:1,592 --> 0:43:5,263
My sister and l went to Catechism,
which is Catholic, you know,


898
0:43:5,263 --> 0:43:8,699
like Hebrew school for papists.


899
0:43:8,699 --> 0:43:10,201
lt was like war.


900
0:43:10,201 --> 0:43:13,371
lt was vast stretches
of boredom punctuated


901
0:43:13,371 --> 0:43:21,712
by moments of sheer terror.


902
0:43:21,712 --> 0:43:29,487
l'm in the Vatican.


903
0:43:29,487 --> 0:43:31,355
Buongiorno!


904
0:43:31,355 --> 0:43:34,292
l know what you're thinking.
l'm standing in front of a green screen


905
0:43:34,292 --> 0:43:36,227
at a studio
in Burbank, California,


906
0:43:36,227 --> 0:43:38,763
and they digitalized
the Vatican in behind me.


907
0:43:38,763 --> 0:43:41,465
No no, that's really the Vatican.


908
0:43:41,465 --> 0:43:43,467
l ought to know.
l just got thrown out of it.


909
0:43:43,467 --> 0:43:45,369
See, l wanted
to interview the Pope,


910
0:43:45,369 --> 0:43:49,307
but l was willing to settle
for a cardinal or a monsignor


911
0:43:49,307 --> 0:43:51,475
or the Flying Nun--
really anybody--


912
0:43:51,475 --> 0:43:54,979
but apparently l've been on the
Catholic shit list for quite a while.


913
0:43:54,979 --> 0:43:58,15
But that's their loss, 'cause now
l'm gonna say what l really think,


914
0:43:58,15 --> 0:44:0,117
which is mainly:


915
0:44:0,117 --> 0:44:1,752
Does that look anything


916
0:44:1,752 --> 0:44:4,588
like anything Jesus Christ
had in mind?


917
0:44:4,588 --> 0:44:7,959
When you look at a building
like that, a giant palace,


918
0:44:7,959 --> 0:44:10,194
does it seem at odds
with the message of the founder?


919
0:44:10,194 --> 0:44:11,762
Well, certainly.


920
0:44:11,762 --> 0:44:15,199
- Well, thank you.
- l mean, that's obvious.


921
0:44:15,199 --> 0:44:18,769
lt really is obvious, isn't it?
But does it bother you?


922
0:44:18,769 --> 0:44:22,173
Well, l mean--
well, yes it does.


923
0:44:22,173 --> 0:44:24,775
l wouldn't--
if l were the boss,


924
0:44:24,775 --> 0:44:26,711
l wouldn't be living there.


925
0:44:26,711 --> 0:44:29,747
l mean Jesus would be
probably out in some barracks here


926
0:44:29,747 --> 0:44:32,984
in a suburb of Rome, got it?


927
0:44:32,984 --> 0:44:35,853
Do you ever get so fed up
you want to take the collar and go...


928
0:44:35,853 --> 0:44:37,888
- Well, l don't wear a collar anyway.
- ...''That's it, Captain.


929
0:44:37,888 --> 0:44:39,957
Take my badge and my collar.''


930
0:44:39,957 --> 0:44:43,194
l read about 10 books recently--
the rationality of religion,


931
0:44:43,194 --> 0:44:47,31
and everyone's saying it's stupid.


932
0:44:47,31 --> 0:44:49,33
You know what's
gonna happen to them.


933
0:44:49,33 --> 0:44:50,735
- No, what's gonna happen?
- They're gonna be roasting in hell.


934
0:44:50,735 --> 0:44:53,404
Come on, roasting.
That's the old Catholic thing.


935
0:44:53,404 --> 0:44:54,905
That's what they taught me.


936
0:44:54,905 --> 0:44:56,707
Yeah, l know, that hell business.


937
0:44:56,707 --> 0:44:59,543
Well, come on, the standard doctrine
that l was taught as a kid--


938
0:44:59,543 --> 0:45:1,746
Yeah, that's all gone.
That's all finished.


939
0:45:1,746 --> 0:45:3,247
But that's not fair.


940
0:45:3,247 --> 0:45:6,584
- Yeah, pfft!
- The date of Jesus's birth


941
0:45:6,584 --> 0:45:9,86
really wasn't established
until 349 A.D.


942
0:45:9,86 --> 0:45:11,322
Oh, yeah...


943
0:45:11,322 --> 0:45:14,25
because he might've
been born on July 3rd.


944
0:45:14,25 --> 0:45:17,595
These are all
nice stories, you know.


945
0:45:17,595 --> 0:45:19,964
- And that doesn't bother you, either?
- That bothers me too.


946
0:45:19,964 --> 0:45:22,333
l mean, when everybody's,
''Ooh, we have to have midnight mass


947
0:45:22,333 --> 0:45:25,169
because Jesus was born
on midnight on 25th of''--


948
0:45:25,169 --> 0:45:27,104
this is all nonsense.


949
0:45:27,104 --> 0:45:29,24
- You're a maverick, aren't you?
- l'm not a maverick.


950
0:45:29,24 --> 0:45:38,249
You're Father Maverick.
You do things your own way.


951
0:45:38,249 --> 0:45:41,285
When you add up
all the saints and all the angels


952
0:45:41,285 --> 0:45:43,921
and archangels
and super-duper angels--


953
0:45:43,921 --> 0:45:46,957
there's God, the Father,
God the Son, the Holy Ghost,


954
0:45:46,957 --> 0:45:49,727
Mother Mary--
it does start to look like


955
0:45:49,727 --> 0:45:52,496
it's not quite
the monotheistic religion that it's--


956
0:45:52,496 --> 0:45:54,932
Oh, l understand.
Like we have mini-gods.


957
0:45:54,932 --> 0:45:58,402
Yeah, well, it does seem like that,
if people pray to a--


958
0:45:58,402 --> 0:46:0,571
Well, yeah, but some people
just don't understand this.


959
0:46:0,571 --> 0:46:3,14
You probably are--
you don't follow things--


960
0:46:3,14 --> 0:46:5,776
but they had a survey here
in ltaly, you know,


961
0:46:5,776 --> 0:46:7,778
and they said, ''ln a crisis,


962
0:46:7,778 --> 0:46:10,448
what kind of saints
do you pray to?'' Got it?


963
0:46:10,448 --> 0:46:13,584
You know who's the sixth
on the list? Jesus Christ.


964
0:46:13,584 --> 0:46:15,319
The sixth?


965
0:46:15,319 --> 0:46:18,856
He's the sixth man
that the ltalians call upon


966
0:46:18,856 --> 0:46:21,325
when they have problems.
lsn't that neat?


967
0:46:21,325 --> 0:46:25,729
- That's very interesting.
- Talk about Cafeteria Catholics. Pfft!


968
0:46:25,729 --> 0:46:27,765
So how do you convince people
of what's the true faith?


969
0:46:27,765 --> 0:46:30,734
You don't, forget it.
You just have to live and die


970
0:46:30,734 --> 0:46:33,671
with their stupid ideas.


971
0:46:33,671 --> 0:46:35,94
l'm sorry.
What are you gonna do?


972
0:46:35,94 --> 0:46:37,942
You can go to a pitch meeting
at a movie studio and go,


973
0:46:37,942 --> 0:46:40,377
''Okay, there's a spaceman


974
0:46:40,377 --> 0:46:42,113
who zaps a virgin


975
0:46:42,113 --> 0:46:45,15
and he gives birth
to a son who's also him,


976
0:46:45,15 --> 0:46:46,951
who then goes
on a suicide mission.''


977
0:46:46,951 --> 0:46:48,419
l wonder what people
would say about that.


978
0:46:48,419 --> 0:46:50,621
Yeah, that is actually
a great pitch.


979
0:46:50,621 --> 0:46:52,923
lt has so many elements
that they like,


980
0:46:52,923 --> 0:46:54,925
because they love
suicide missions.


981
0:46:54,925 --> 0:46:57,761
They love violence,
and Hollywood loves something


982
0:46:57,761 --> 0:47:17,47
it's never seen before-- a virgin.


983
0:47:17,47 --> 0:47:24,955
Hey, Shalom.


984
0:47:24,955 --> 0:47:34,298
We're so glad to have you here.
Just come and get blessed.


985
0:47:34,298 --> 0:47:36,167
These are here to teach God's word.


986
0:47:36,167 --> 0:47:38,2
We're in a spiritual warfare.


987
0:47:38,2 --> 0:47:40,37
We don't push our beliefs on people,


988
0:47:40,37 --> 0:47:42,139
but we do make them available.


989
0:47:42,139 --> 0:47:45,42
- Have you ever had a Muslim person?
- Yes, definitely.


990
0:47:45,42 --> 0:47:50,47
People from Gaza Strip come.


991
0:47:50,47 --> 0:47:52,216
We get many people
who come here say,


992
0:47:52,216 --> 0:47:54,485
''We've come every year
to Florida


993
0:47:54,485 --> 0:47:57,755
and we've done the tourist
things and all and we enjoy those.


994
0:47:57,755 --> 0:48:1,25
We wish we had
seen this first,''


995
0:48:1,25 --> 0:48:4,328
because their experience
here was so meaningful.


996
0:48:4,328 --> 0:48:7,364
Do you think if--
when you were a kid--


997
0:48:7,364 --> 0:48:10,668
they transposed the Bible stories


998
0:48:10,668 --> 0:48:14,438
with the fairy tales, you'd know
the difference as an adult?


999
0:48:14,438 --> 0:48:17,141
- My name is Eve.
- l'm Adam.


1000
0:48:17,141 --> 0:48:19,109
This place is amazing.


1001
0:48:19,109 --> 0:48:21,912
lf they told you Jack
and the Beanstalk was religion


1002
0:48:21,912 --> 0:48:26,45
and that a man who lived
in a whale was in a fairy-tale book...


1003
0:48:26,45 --> 0:48:28,586
you think when you got
to be an adult,


1004
0:48:28,586 --> 0:48:30,621
you'd be defending
the one instead of the other?


1005
0:48:30,621 --> 0:48:32,756
So you're saying that
the Bible's a fairy tale?


1006
0:48:32,756 --> 0:48:35,693
God took my rib like this


1007
0:48:35,693 --> 0:48:37,661
and began to whittle it


1008
0:48:37,661 --> 0:48:39,563
like this


1009
0:48:39,563 --> 0:48:43,33
and blow on it...
and then--


1010
0:48:43,33 --> 0:48:45,836
Saved means believing
in Jesus Christ


1011
0:48:45,836 --> 0:48:47,638
- as the only begotten Son of God.
- Not for me, it don't.


1012
0:48:47,638 --> 0:48:49,573
What about the Muslims?


1013
0:48:49,573 --> 0:48:51,909
Many Muslims are
saved right now.


1014
0:48:51,909 --> 0:48:53,377
l don't get it.


1015
0:48:53,377 --> 0:48:55,813
l pray in your lifetime you do.


1016
0:48:55,813 --> 0:48:59,483
Jesus came through a Jew.
He was not the seed of man.


1017
0:48:59,483 --> 0:49:1,485
He came through
a Jewish woman,


1018
0:49:1,485 --> 0:49:3,12
but no man had
ever touched her.


1019
0:49:3,12 --> 0:49:5,189
No flesh had ever
touched her.


1020
0:49:5,189 --> 0:49:26,41
He was the seed of God.


1021
0:49:26,41 --> 0:49:28,45
You want me to lean up against
the tomb or something


1022
0:49:28,45 --> 0:49:31,115
or you want casual or-- okay.


1023
0:49:31,115 --> 0:49:32,75
Did l give you my cell phone?


1024
0:49:32,75 --> 0:49:35,85
Oh, l left my cell phone, right?
Just want to make sure.


1025
0:49:35,85 --> 0:49:37,21
Testing one two,
check, testing.


1026
0:49:37,21 --> 0:49:39,923
How you doing, Bill?
God bless you.


1027
0:49:39,923 --> 0:49:41,191
- Hi.
- Seen you around.


1028
0:49:41,191 --> 0:49:43,627
- Welcome to our world.
- l've seen you around.


1029
0:49:43,627 --> 0:49:46,864
Now is this your tomb?
ls this a real rock?


1030
0:49:46,864 --> 0:49:49,533
No, it's just cement.
They just kind of cemented it in there.


1031
0:49:49,533 --> 0:49:52,303
So when you go out to dinner,
people recognize you?


1032
0:49:52,303 --> 0:49:53,637
All the time, yeah.


1033
0:49:53,637 --> 0:49:56,24
l think you get
a little bit of that, too.


1034
0:49:56,24 --> 0:49:59,81
But they don't think l'm the Lord.
You must really be--


1035
0:49:59,81 --> 0:50:2,813
Why do you think people come here?
'Cause Disneyland's too smutty?


1036
0:50:2,813 --> 0:50:4,581
l personally haven't been
to the Holy Land,


1037
0:50:4,581 --> 0:50:6,55
so this was an awesome experience
for me when l walked on the property.


1038
0:50:6,55 --> 0:50:9,953
- l was like, ''Wow, this is cool.''
- Let me ask you questions


1039
0:50:9,953 --> 0:50:11,388
- about your business...
- Yes.


1040
0:50:11,388 --> 0:50:14,858
...or really the Jesus business.
God is super powerful.


1041
0:50:14,858 --> 0:50:16,56
- He can do anything.
- Sure.


1042
0:50:16,56 --> 0:50:19,763
Why doesn't
he just obliterate the devil


1043
0:50:19,763 --> 0:50:23,67
and therefore get rid
of evil in the world?


1044
0:50:23,67 --> 0:50:25,836
- He will.
- He will? What's he waiting for?


1045
0:50:25,836 --> 0:50:27,838
- End times.
- But why play it out like that?


1046
0:50:27,838 --> 0:50:30,307
- Why make it a game?
- Well, it's not necessarily a game.


1047
0:50:30,307 --> 0:50:33,477
A day is like a thousand years
in God's eyes, it says in the Bible.


1048
0:50:33,477 --> 0:50:35,879
lf you wanna look at it--
just like two days ago, Christ died.


1049
0:50:35,879 --> 0:50:39,45
But l know that he is
so far beyond any of our ways,


1050
0:50:39,45 --> 0:50:41,985
that he can work
the worst situation for his good.


1051
0:50:41,985 --> 0:50:44,21
What was the Holocaust?
Why was that good?


1052
0:50:44,21 --> 0:50:46,523
You know, God had a plan for that.
Maybe it's to cause--


1053
0:50:46,523 --> 0:50:48,359
l wonder if you would have thought
that if you were one of the people


1054
0:50:48,359 --> 0:50:50,494
- being pushed into an oven.
- Well, you know what?


1055
0:50:50,494 --> 0:50:52,863
lt's like trying to explain
to an ant how a TV works.


1056
0:50:52,863 --> 0:50:55,432
That's-- God's ways are
so much higher than ours.


1057
0:50:55,432 --> 0:50:58,202
There's no way
you can understand that.


1058
0:50:58,202 --> 0:51:0,37
We need to stop the interview
for just a moment, please.


1059
0:51:0,37 --> 0:51:1,905
- Nice to see you.
- Senior manager of public relations.


1060
0:51:1,905 --> 0:51:13,25
- Hi, Les, l'll be right with you.
- Hi. Sure.


1061
0:51:13,25 --> 0:51:15,552
l'm not afraid
of the piranha women.


1062
0:51:15,552 --> 0:51:18,222
When he came, he said, ''l come not
to abolish the law, but to fulfill it.''


1063
0:51:18,222 --> 0:51:20,791
You boil all those
Levitical laws down to two things:


1064
0:51:20,791 --> 0:51:22,359
No other God is before me, Bill,


1065
0:51:22,359 --> 0:51:24,261
and love the Lord with all your heart.


1066
0:51:24,261 --> 0:51:26,63
But, Jesus, having
no other gods before you,


1067
0:51:26,63 --> 0:51:28,799
that's not moral.
There's nothing moral about that.


1068
0:51:28,799 --> 0:51:31,502
lt's just something
a jealous god would do.


1069
0:51:31,502 --> 0:51:33,537
lt does say that our God
is a jealous god.


1070
0:51:33,537 --> 0:51:37,274
But your God is jealous?
That seems so unGodlike


1071
0:51:37,274 --> 0:51:39,576
that God would have such
a petty human emotion.


1072
0:51:39,576 --> 0:51:42,79
l know people who have
gotten over jealousy,


1073
0:51:42,79 --> 0:51:44,181
- let alone God.
- There's two sides to the coin.


1074
0:51:44,181 --> 0:51:46,95
He's a just God
and he's also a merciful God.


1075
0:51:46,95 --> 0:51:50,954
No, he spends the first five books
of the Bible wiping out people.


1076
0:51:50,954 --> 0:51:54,224
That's what he chose to do.
His ways are higher than ours, Bill.


1077
0:51:54,224 --> 0:51:56,894
- Maybe our thinking should be higher.
- That's a good point.


1078
0:51:56,894 --> 0:51:59,897
God has got
this God-sized hole in your life.


1079
0:51:59,897 --> 0:52:1,765
You can fit that
with any position--


1080
0:52:1,765 --> 0:52:4,401
drugs, sex, whatever you want--
it is not gonna fill it.


1081
0:52:4,401 --> 0:52:5,969
- Can l try?
- You can try all you want.


1082
0:52:5,969 --> 0:52:7,137
You're gonna end up
hurting yourself,


1083
0:52:7,137 --> 0:52:8,939
damaging yourself
and burning yourself up.


1084
0:52:8,939 --> 0:52:11,175
l thought Christ was
about not judging people.


1085
0:52:11,175 --> 0:52:13,444
- That's true.
- lsn't that a judgment there?


1086
0:52:13,444 --> 0:52:16,13
You don't know me and you're telling me
l need to fill a hole in my heart


1087
0:52:16,13 --> 0:52:18,81
- with drugs and sex.
- No, l'm not talking about you.


1088
0:52:18,81 --> 0:52:19,65
l'm saying anyone in general.


1089
0:52:19,65 --> 0:52:22,953
See, if l was God, l would create people
without the hole to begin with.


1090
0:52:22,953 --> 0:52:26,69
Have you ever had a little voice in
the back of your mind say something?


1091
0:52:26,69 --> 0:52:28,525
- We've all had that.
- That's called the Holy Spirit.


1092
0:52:28,525 --> 0:52:30,994
- That's not God. That's you.
- That's called the Holy Spirit.


1093
0:52:30,994 --> 0:52:32,329
- Feel this wind right now?
- Yeah.


1094
0:52:32,329 --> 0:52:34,331
Okay, where is it?
You don't know, right?


1095
0:52:34,331 --> 0:52:37,0
- Yeah, it's called wind.
- Okay, that's like the Holy Spirit.


1096
0:52:37,0 --> 0:52:40,37
lt's a monotheistic religion,
but there's three of them.


1097
0:52:40,37 --> 0:52:42,506
Just like water can be ice,
steam and water.


1098
0:52:42,506 --> 0:52:44,341
l see.


1099
0:52:44,341 --> 0:52:46,543
lt's different forms, different shapes
for the different purposes.


1100
0:52:46,543 --> 0:52:48,745
The analogy that Jesus
at the amusement park


1101
0:52:48,745 --> 0:52:50,647
said yesterday was brilliant,


1102
0:52:50,647 --> 0:52:53,35
about the Trinity is like water.


1103
0:52:53,35 --> 0:52:55,586
lt can be steam. lt can be ice.


1104
0:52:55,586 --> 0:52:58,455
lt can be liquid.
Wow, that is--


1105
0:52:58,455 --> 0:53:1,425
boy, that stopped me
in my tracks for a second, you know?


1106
0:53:1,425 --> 0:53:3,36
That's just a brilliant analogy.


1107
0:53:3,36 --> 0:53:4,862
When you think about it
for two minutes,


1108
0:53:4,862 --> 0:53:7,397
it's still complete bullshit.


1109
0:53:7,397 --> 0:53:9,5
There this space God
and he's himself


1110
0:53:9,5 --> 0:53:11,802
and he sent himself
on a suicide mission.


1111
0:53:11,802 --> 0:53:14,872
He's a God, but he has a kid.
He's a single parent.


1112
0:53:14,872 --> 0:53:18,842
lt's just silly, but when you put it
in the water analogy,


1113
0:53:18,842 --> 0:53:21,111
l can see that, you know,
those ladies there,


1114
0:53:21,111 --> 0:53:23,28
when they heard that the first time,
they were like, done.


1115
0:53:23,28 --> 0:53:27,5
Sold. Oh, you had me
at ice cube.


1116
0:53:27,5 --> 0:53:29,72
Moving on.
Does it ever bother you


1117
0:53:29,72 --> 0:53:33,257
that the story of a man


1118
0:53:33,257 --> 0:53:36,693
who was born of a virgin
was resurrected?


1119
0:53:36,693 --> 0:53:39,93
Your bio was something that was
going around the Mediterranean


1120
0:53:39,93 --> 0:53:41,665
for at least 1,000 years.


1121
0:53:41,665 --> 0:53:44,368
We've got Krishna who was in lndia


1122
0:53:44,368 --> 0:53:47,4
1,000 years before Christ.
Krishna was a carpenter,


1123
0:53:47,4 --> 0:53:49,74
born of a virgin, baptized in a river.


1124
0:53:49,74 --> 0:53:51,742
Are you saying that
was written in history?


1125
0:53:51,742 --> 0:53:53,544
That was written down in history,
is that what you're saying?


1126
0:53:53,544 --> 0:53:57,247
Absolutely, there's the Persian god
Mithra, 600 years before Christ.


1127
0:53:57,247 --> 0:53:59,917
Born December 25th,
performed miracles,


1128
0:53:59,917 --> 0:54:1,852
resurrected on the third day,


1129
0:54:1,852 --> 0:54:5,355
known as the Lamb, the Way, the Truth,
the Light, the Savior, Messiah.


1130
0:54:5,355 --> 0:54:7,524
Stop! Blasphemer!


1131
0:54:7,524 --> 0:54:9,826
All l know is that
l don't go by that hearsay.


1132
0:54:9,826 --> 0:54:13,63
l go by the word of God.
l know that's why l believe.


1133
0:54:13,63 --> 0:54:15,999
- Well, l believe it because it's truth.
- Believe it, yes.


1134
0:54:15,999 --> 0:54:18,535
But there's a difference
between truth and what you believe.


1135
0:54:18,535 --> 0:54:21,838
ln the Bible it tells us that all things
are possible with God, okay?


1136
0:54:21,838 --> 0:54:24,107
Study the religions
of the Mediterranean region


1137
0:54:24,107 --> 0:54:25,709
for a thousand years before.


1138
0:54:25,709 --> 0:54:29,613
Many of the gods were born
on December 25th.


1139
0:54:29,613 --> 0:54:32,316
- No, it's not.
- lt's not a new one.


1140
0:54:32,316 --> 0:54:34,384
lt's funny you should bring
that up because of course


1141
0:54:34,384 --> 0:54:36,86
in ''Star Wars: Episode l--
The Phantom Menace,''


1142
0:54:36,86 --> 0:54:37,788
Anakin is born to a virgin.


1143
0:54:37,788 --> 0:54:39,156
People see that
and say, ''Wait a second.


1144
0:54:39,156 --> 0:54:41,425
Where have we heard that before?''
That's not original.


1145
0:54:41,425 --> 0:55:34,544
- But the Jesus story wasn't original.
- How so?


1146
0:55:34,544 --> 0:55:37,18
Let me ask you a question.
Let's say, if you take the side


1147
0:55:37,18 --> 0:55:40,484
- that this is all made up...
- l do.


1148
0:55:40,484 --> 0:55:43,253
...what if you're wrong?


1149
0:55:43,253 --> 0:55:55,532
What if you're wrong?


1150
0:55:55,532 --> 0:55:59,436
# Down the Via Dolorosa #


1151
0:55:59,436 --> 0:56:3,6
# ln Jerusalem that day #


1152
0:56:3,6 --> 0:56:5,308
# The soldiers tried #


1153
0:56:5,308 --> 0:56:10,313
# To clear
the narrow street #


1154
0:56:10,313 --> 0:56:14,217
# But the crowd
pressed in to see #


1155
0:56:14,217 --> 0:56:16,486
# The man condemned to die #


1156
0:56:16,486 --> 0:56:21,324
# On Calvary #


1157
0:56:21,324 --> 0:56:24,528
# Down the Via Dolorosa #


1158
0:56:24,528 --> 0:56:28,265
# Called the Way of Suffering #


1159
0:56:28,265 --> 0:56:31,535
# Like a lamb came the Messiah #


1160
0:56:31,535 --> 0:56:35,505
# Christ the King #


1161
0:56:35,505 --> 0:56:38,508
# And he chose to walk that road #


1162
0:56:38,508 --> 0:56:41,611
# Out of his love #


1163
0:56:41,611 --> 0:56:43,88
# For you #


1164
0:56:43,88 --> 0:57:7,27
# And me. #


1165
0:57:7,27 --> 0:57:9,539
Was Jesus a sinner?


1166
0:57:9,539 --> 0:57:15,912
One master. One word.
l am your master.


1167
0:57:15,912 --> 0:57:26,556
Who do we put away
in the asylums?


1168
0:57:26,556 --> 0:57:28,625
Xenu brought us here


1169
0:57:28,625 --> 0:57:30,627
75 million years ago,


1170
0:57:30,627 --> 0:57:33,363
stacked us around volcanoes


1171
0:57:33,363 --> 0:57:39,2
and blew them up with an H-bomb.


1172
0:57:39,2 --> 0:57:44,975
We are older than the universe.


1173
0:57:44,975 --> 0:57:47,277
You have to rid yourself


1174
0:57:47,277 --> 0:57:48,945
of the implants


1175
0:57:48,945 --> 0:57:55,685
from the extraterrestrial dictators!


1176
0:57:55,685 --> 0:58:2,959
- Get an E-Meter. Yes, get an E-Meter!
- An E-meter?


1177
0:58:2,959 --> 0:58:7,798
Audit yourself.


1178
0:58:7,798 --> 0:58:13,503
How do you people expect
to get to the next level?


1179
0:58:13,503 --> 0:58:17,307
l'm not making the rules.


1180
0:58:17,307 --> 0:58:21,344
Aw...


1181
0:58:21,344 --> 0:58:26,783
You know, Scientologists...


1182
0:58:26,783 --> 0:58:30,72
And right, you're like,
''Oh, yeah, that's some crazy shit. Okay.


1183
0:58:30,72 --> 0:58:33,69
Jesus with the virgin birth
and the dove and the snake


1184
0:58:33,69 --> 0:58:37,127
who talked in the garden,
that's cool.


1185
0:58:37,127 --> 0:58:40,33
But the Scientologists,
they're the crazy ones.''


1186
0:58:40,33 --> 0:58:41,531
That's not true.


1187
0:58:41,531 --> 0:58:43,733
That-- that--
l don't have any idea


1188
0:58:43,733 --> 0:58:46,2
of what
you're talking about.


1189
0:58:46,2 --> 0:58:48,71
But it has something to do
with making sure


1190
0:58:48,71 --> 0:58:50,307
that we're born with a defect,


1191
0:58:50,307 --> 0:58:52,142
so that the souls of ours


1192
0:58:52,142 --> 0:58:54,544
are infected with aliens...


1193
0:58:54,544 --> 0:58:57,47
Thank you.


1194
0:58:57,47 --> 0:59:1,51
...because the cure?
Scientology.


1195
0:59:1,51 --> 0:59:4,521
They're all crazy.
Yes, the religions do get even crazier.


1196
0:59:4,521 --> 0:59:7,57
They have to to keep up.


1197
0:59:7,57 --> 0:59:9,526
They keep raising the bar.
After you've done the virgin birth,


1198
0:59:9,526 --> 0:59:28,678
you know,
where do you go?


1199
0:59:28,678 --> 0:59:30,413
We're not getting the top?


1200
0:59:30,413 --> 0:59:32,182
- We got the top.
- Oh, okay.


1201
0:59:32,182 --> 0:59:34,284
That's the Mormon Temple
behind me.


1202
0:59:34,284 --> 0:59:37,2
To be a Mormon is to believe
some really crazy stuff,


1203
0:59:37,2 --> 0:59:40,523
crazy even by the standards
of the big religions.


1204
0:59:40,523 --> 0:59:43,627
When you're the new kid
on the block--


1205
0:59:43,627 --> 0:59:46,863
Thank you.
That was helpful.


1206
0:59:46,863 --> 0:59:48,431
You're the new kid
on the block


1207
0:59:48,431 --> 0:59:50,233
and all the good crazy has
already been picked over,


1208
0:59:50,233 --> 0:59:52,769
so you kind of have to up the ante.


1209
0:59:52,769 --> 0:59:54,237
Oh.


1210
0:59:54,237 --> 0:59:56,139
God damn it.


1211
0:59:56,139 --> 1:0:0,61
Not while
l'm in the middle of it.


1212
1:0:0,61 --> 1:0:3,113
Well, we do have it.


1213
1:0:3,113 --> 1:0:4,247
Boy, a lot of people came


1214
1:0:4,247 --> 1:0:11,554
- out of the woodwork.
- Yeah.


1215
1:0:11,554 --> 1:0:13,79
So did you guys get anybody
from the church to talk to?


1216
1:0:13,79 --> 1:0:16,493
Well, if you count getting
thrown off the property


1217
1:0:16,493 --> 1:0:19,996
- ''talked to.''
- That's probably better.


1218
1:0:19,996 --> 1:0:23,3
We'd like you
to ''Meet the Mormons.''


1219
1:0:23,3 --> 1:0:25,702
ln the founding scripture,
you open up the Doctrine of Covenants,


1220
1:0:25,702 --> 1:0:27,871
you read the autobiography
of Joseph Smith.


1221
1:0:27,871 --> 1:0:31,74
He quotes Jesus Christ as telling him


1222
1:0:31,74 --> 1:0:33,343
that every other creed
on earth is, quote,


1223
1:0:33,343 --> 1:0:35,512
''an abomination.''
An abomination.


1224
1:0:35,512 --> 1:0:37,981
l mean, that's not
a very ecumenical statement.


1225
1:0:37,981 --> 1:0:41,17
You're talking about things that,
l think, at some level


1226
1:0:41,17 --> 1:0:43,687
you sense just
do not make sense.


1227
1:0:43,687 --> 1:0:46,89
l'm glad you said that because l read
some of the tenets of Mormonism,


1228
1:0:46,89 --> 1:0:50,93
like ''God lives on a planet
near the star of Kalob.''


1229
1:0:50,93 --> 1:0:51,861
- Kolob.
- Kolob.


1230
1:0:51,861 --> 1:0:54,831
God the Father who's a physical man
with a body of flesh and bone


1231
1:0:54,831 --> 1:0:58,435
is probably about 6' tall,
lives on a place called Kolob,


1232
1:0:58,435 --> 1:1:1,805
had sexual relations with Mary--
remember he's a man.


1233
1:1:1,805 --> 1:1:4,374
''Jesus Christ was conceived
by God the father


1234
1:1:4,374 --> 1:1:6,443
having actual sex with Mary.''


1235
1:1:6,443 --> 1:1:8,845
Mary said, ''lf this is what God wants,


1236
1:1:8,845 --> 1:1:10,714
l'll be glad to do His will.''


1237
1:1:10,714 --> 1:1:12,716
''Dark skin is a curse from God,


1238
1:1:12,716 --> 1:1:14,351
but if you're sufficiently righteous,


1239
1:1:14,351 --> 1:1:15,552
a dark-skinned person


1240
1:1:15,552 --> 1:1:17,854
can become light-skinned.''


1241
1:1:17,854 --> 1:1:20,323
According to
the Book of Mormon,


1242
1:1:20,323 --> 1:1:22,826
after his resurrection,
Jesus came to the Americas


1243
1:1:22,826 --> 1:1:24,794
to preach to the lndians.


1244
1:1:24,794 --> 1:1:27,897
''That American lndians are
actually a lost tribe of lsrael.''


1245
1:1:27,897 --> 1:1:31,201
They're lost Jews.


1246
1:1:31,201 --> 1:1:32,769
And also the idea


1247
1:1:32,769 --> 1:1:35,305
that Christianity
is American,


1248
1:1:35,305 --> 1:1:37,841
l think, is an amazing
entitlement to a people


1249
1:1:37,841 --> 1:1:41,644
who are always trying
to meld God and country.


1250
1:1:41,644 --> 1:1:45,15
The Garden of Eden was
in Missouri according to Mormonism.


1251
1:1:45,15 --> 1:1:46,916
The new Jerusalem
will be there.


1252
1:1:46,916 --> 1:1:48,852
Branson, l'm hoping.


1253
1:1:48,852 --> 1:1:51,821
l've also heard that the Mormon Church
baptizes dead people.


1254
1:1:51,821 --> 1:1:54,157
You can be baptized
for about 50 people,


1255
1:1:54,157 --> 1:1:56,226
100 people that've died.


1256
1:1:56,226 --> 1:1:58,995
And so you just get dunked
about 50 to 100 times.


1257
1:1:58,995 --> 1:2:0,597
That's baptism for the dead.


1258
1:2:0,597 --> 1:2:11,341
Caffeine is evil.
That magic underwear can protect you.


1259
1:2:11,341 --> 1:2:14,611
And that you need
a secret password to get into heaven.


1260
1:2:14,611 --> 1:2:16,946
Everyone must stand
at the final judgment


1261
1:2:16,946 --> 1:2:19,916
before Joseph Smith,
Jesus and Elohim.


1262
1:2:19,916 --> 1:2:21,418
This isn't an easy religion.


1263
1:2:21,418 --> 1:2:24,421
Why do you think it is that
so few people


1264
1:2:24,421 --> 1:2:26,556
do what you have done
and leave the church?


1265
1:2:26,556 --> 1:2:28,825
The moment you acknowledge
to yourself that Joseph Smith


1266
1:2:28,825 --> 1:2:32,829
did not tell the truth about
his experiences and his achievements,


1267
1:2:32,829 --> 1:2:35,698
you just committed
social suicide.


1268
1:2:35,698 --> 1:2:37,567
- Family and friends...
- Family and friends.


1269
1:2:37,567 --> 1:2:39,803
...will-- you're off the deep end.


1270
1:2:39,803 --> 1:2:43,139
Dr. Andrew Newberg,
nice to meet you.


1271
1:2:43,139 --> 1:2:47,41
l've finally met someone
who's studied... neurotheology.


1272
1:2:47,41 --> 1:2:49,646
This is getting very close
to something l always say,


1273
1:2:49,646 --> 1:2:53,49
which is that religion is
a neurological disorder.


1274
1:2:53,49 --> 1:2:55,952
What does the brain look like
when it's hopped up on God?


1275
1:2:55,952 --> 1:2:58,154
We see a lot of different colors,
which help us to--


1276
1:2:58,154 --> 1:2:59,956
tell us what
the activity is in the brain


1277
1:2:59,956 --> 1:3:2,892
and what we have found is that
there are some very specific changes


1278
1:3:2,892 --> 1:3:5,428
when people are actually
meditating or praying


1279
1:3:5,428 --> 1:3:7,897
or even speaking in tongues,
which was our last study.


1280
1:3:7,897 --> 1:3:10,4
ln the name of Jesus,


1281
1:3:10,4 --> 1:3:13,69
you've been made whole
by the power of God.


1282
1:3:13,69 --> 1:3:15,271
- Speaking in tongues?
- We studied people speaking in tongues.


1283
1:3:15,271 --> 1:3:20,643
They're just babbling,
though, right?


1284
1:3:20,643 --> 1:3:22,745
They're not really speaking
in a language they don't know.


1285
1:3:22,745 --> 1:3:25,748
lt's not an actual language,
but what's--


1286
1:3:25,748 --> 1:3:27,417
Just bullshit, Doc,
come on.


1287
1:3:27,417 --> 1:3:42,165
lsn't that something?


1288
1:3:42,165 --> 1:3:44,601
l love you.


1289
1:3:44,601 --> 1:3:47,971
So you would agree that
even if a billion people


1290
1:3:47,971 --> 1:3:50,473
believe something,
it can still be ridiculous?


1291
1:3:50,473 --> 1:3:52,842
- Absolutely.
- But the Jews, l mean, they're--


1292
1:3:52,842 --> 1:3:55,645
excuse me, Jewish friends--
but they're as cuckoo as anybody,


1293
1:3:55,645 --> 1:3:57,647
especially the really Orthodox ones.


1294
1:3:57,647 --> 1:4:1,251
You are one of the
few Jewish people in the world


1295
1:4:1,251 --> 1:4:3,286
who does not believe
in the state of lsrael.


1296
1:4:3,286 --> 1:4:4,754
You do not think the state


1297
1:4:4,754 --> 1:4:8,57
- of lsrael should exist.
- Correct.


1298
1:4:8,57 --> 1:4:10,193
- Okay.
- God gave us the land of lsrael.


1299
1:4:10,193 --> 1:4:14,33
On Mount Sinai where we made
this bond with God,


1300
1:4:14,33 --> 1:4:16,933
He said, ''l'm giving you the land,
but l'm stipulating--


1301
1:4:16,933 --> 1:4:20,37
very clearly stipulating-- you must
be on a certain level of holiness.''


1302
1:4:20,37 --> 1:4:22,138
You will see it clearly
that we were sent out of the land.


1303
1:4:22,138 --> 1:4:24,307
So basically you're saying that


1304
1:4:24,307 --> 1:4:26,509
the Jewish people have
not been holy enough


1305
1:4:26,509 --> 1:4:28,511
to deserve
the land of lsrael.


1306
1:4:28,511 --> 1:4:30,413
God understands what is good for us,
what is bad for us...


1307
1:4:30,413 --> 1:4:32,649
- First of all--
- ...what will bring us safety or not.


1308
1:4:32,649 --> 1:4:33,683
Let me just finish.


1309
1:4:33,683 --> 1:4:35,852
God told us, though,
if you will go against God--


1310
1:4:35,852 --> 1:4:38,188
- God manipulates the world--
- Okay, l--


1311
1:4:38,188 --> 1:4:40,23
Wait a second.
Let me finish this.


1312
1:4:40,23 --> 1:4:42,91
God said if you're going
to try to make the state,


1313
1:4:42,91 --> 1:4:44,194
you will be unsuccessful.


1314
1:4:44,194 --> 1:4:45,795
You are looking through--


1315
1:4:45,795 --> 1:4:48,765
you're trying to look
at this world through a keyhole.


1316
1:4:48,765 --> 1:4:50,934
l'm looking through the key--


1317
1:4:50,934 --> 1:4:53,269
Let me finish.
God is compassionate.


1318
1:4:53,269 --> 1:4:55,271
Everything is directly
from God, we believe.


1319
1:4:55,271 --> 1:4:58,241
- But it seems to me--
- l'll now explain what you're asking.


1320
1:4:58,241 --> 1:5:0,443
The concept of saying


1321
1:5:0,443 --> 1:5:3,46
that we've suffered
enough anti-Semitism--


1322
1:5:3,46 --> 1:5:4,747
Never again.


1323
1:5:4,747 --> 1:5:7,951
So you don't say ''Never again.''
You say ''Again.''


1324
1:5:7,951 --> 1:5:10,954
Yeah. Let us understand
that the Jewish people


1325
1:5:10,954 --> 1:5:12,689
were living in exile
for 2,000 years


1326
1:5:12,689 --> 1:5:14,524
under God's protection


1327
1:5:14,524 --> 1:5:16,526
and we were living
in Western civilization--


1328
1:5:16,526 --> 1:5:18,661
- Germany, Poland. Not anymore...
- Let me finish.


1329
1:5:18,661 --> 1:5:20,63
We were living amongst
all nations throughout the years.


1330
1:5:20,63 --> 1:5:22,799
...'cause they're all dead.
How many people died in the Holocaust?


1331
1:5:22,799 --> 1:5:26,236
You're jumping.
Let's jump to the Holocaust.


1332
1:5:26,236 --> 1:5:28,905
l thought the issue
was Jewish safety.


1333
1:5:28,905 --> 1:5:31,74
l thought the issue was
how many Jews are dying.


1334
1:5:31,74 --> 1:5:33,142
So let's talk
about Jewish safety.


1335
1:5:33,142 --> 1:5:35,178
Okay, l'm sure there was a few--


1336
1:5:35,178 --> 1:5:38,881
A couple million Jews died,
that's okay, that's the wording you use?


1337
1:5:38,881 --> 1:5:42,352
You're the one who went
to lran in December 2006


1338
1:5:42,352 --> 1:5:44,87
for the president


1339
1:5:44,87 --> 1:5:47,423
of that country's
Holocaust ''denial'' conference.


1340
1:5:47,423 --> 1:6:0,436
Whoa, don't just throw words.


1341
1:6:0,436 --> 1:6:3,64
Why does Ahmadinejad say
that he wants lsrael


1342
1:6:3,64 --> 1:6:5,208
- to be wiped from the face of the--
- When did he say that?


1343
1:6:5,208 --> 1:6:7,176
- He did.
- He never said that.


1344
1:6:7,176 --> 1:6:8,778
What did he say?
What was the exact quote?


1345
1:6:8,778 --> 1:6:13,16
- He said it should disappear.
- What, is he David Copperfield?


1346
1:6:13,16 --> 1:6:16,286
- That's chutzpah.
- Never again, Rabbi, never again.


1347
1:6:16,286 --> 1:6:18,187
Wait. One more second.


1348
1:6:18,187 --> 1:6:22,492
No, l'm out.


1349
1:6:22,492 --> 1:6:24,427
We have Conservatives.
We have Reforms.


1350
1:6:24,427 --> 1:6:25,728
We have the Orthodox.


1351
1:6:25,728 --> 1:6:28,364
You are an observing Jew.


1352
1:6:28,364 --> 1:6:30,266
lt says it right there
in the fourth commandment:


1353
1:6:30,266 --> 1:6:32,802
Honor the Sabbath day
to keep it holy.


1354
1:6:32,802 --> 1:6:35,805
Friday night to Saturday night,
you don't do anything.


1355
1:6:35,805 --> 1:6:39,876
Yeah, the rabbis over the centuries
have created these prohibitions


1356
1:6:39,876 --> 1:6:42,345
as a way to try
to protect the day of rest.


1357
1:6:42,345 --> 1:6:46,182
You can't use electricity.
You can't drive.


1358
1:6:46,182 --> 1:6:49,819
Let's talk a little about
keeping the Sabbath holy.


1359
1:6:49,819 --> 1:6:52,388
l've always wondered
if it came about


1360
1:6:52,388 --> 1:6:55,491
because God rested
on the Sabbath


1361
1:6:55,491 --> 1:6:57,493
and that's why man has to.


1362
1:6:57,493 --> 1:6:59,495
That's right,
and that was the creation


1363
1:6:59,495 --> 1:7:1,397
of the seventh day,
that there should be rest.


1364
1:7:1,397 --> 1:7:4,867
There are 39 types of specific actions


1365
1:7:4,867 --> 1:7:7,403
that cannot be done on the Sabbath.


1366
1:7:7,403 --> 1:7:9,38
One of them is lighting a fire.


1367
1:7:9,38 --> 1:7:10,807
Planting. Another one is plowing.


1368
1:7:10,807 --> 1:7:12,642
Another one is
tying a knot, untying a knot.


1369
1:7:12,642 --> 1:7:15,645
One is building, and one is
destroying so as to build.


1370
1:7:15,645 --> 1:7:18,815
So much more kosher is
to develop these gadgets


1371
1:7:18,815 --> 1:7:21,25
- that figure out a way around it.
- That's right.


1372
1:7:21,25 --> 1:7:23,986
lt does seem that you are,
to a degree,


1373
1:7:23,986 --> 1:7:26,89
trying to outsmart God.


1374
1:7:26,89 --> 1:7:29,425
lf the lawmaker never
makes a mistake,


1375
1:7:29,425 --> 1:7:33,329
and still there's a loophole there,
why is that loophole there?


1376
1:7:33,329 --> 1:7:35,732
To be used in a situation of need.


1377
1:7:35,732 --> 1:7:38,167
But how did this get updated


1378
1:7:38,167 --> 1:7:39,836
for a 4,000-year-old rule?


1379
1:7:39,836 --> 1:7:41,738
lt seems there's an awful lot


1380
1:7:41,738 --> 1:7:43,439
that has to do with electricity.


1381
1:7:43,439 --> 1:7:45,541
Rabbi Halperin's work here
is translating it


1382
1:7:45,541 --> 1:7:50,346
into something more modern.


1383
1:7:50,346 --> 1:7:52,348
Let's look at some
of the gadgets you have.


1384
1:7:52,348 --> 1:7:55,918
l'm particularly interested in
the phone. ls there not a cell phone?


1385
1:7:55,918 --> 1:7:57,72
lt's not a cell phone.


1386
1:7:57,72 --> 1:7:59,355
Okay, wow.


1387
1:7:59,355 --> 1:8:3,292
l have to say,
that looks modern.


1388
1:8:3,292 --> 1:8:8,865
Each number is trying
to dial itself all the time.


1389
1:8:8,865 --> 1:8:11,768
Hello. Hello.


1390
1:8:11,768 --> 1:8:13,469
When l take the stick


1391
1:8:13,469 --> 1:8:16,205
- and l put it into the hole...
- Hello.


1392
1:8:16,205 --> 1:8:18,341
...l'm inhibiting that
which is inhibiting


1393
1:8:18,341 --> 1:8:21,244
the number from dialing itself.


1394
1:8:21,244 --> 1:8:24,247
Let me ask about this.
lt's obviously a wheelchair.


1395
1:8:24,247 --> 1:8:28,317
- May l?
- Sure.


1396
1:8:28,317 --> 1:8:31,287
Oh, wow.


1397
1:8:31,287 --> 1:8:33,589
And this is not the new model,
l'm guessing.


1398
1:8:33,589 --> 1:8:35,925
- This is the experimental prototype.
- l see.


1399
1:8:35,925 --> 1:8:38,294
Schmuck!


1400
1:8:38,294 --> 1:8:41,964
- This runs on air pressure, right?
- Correct.


1401
1:8:41,964 --> 1:8:44,133
Basically, we've got
150 atmospheres


1402
1:8:44,133 --> 1:8:46,135
of pressure here.


1403
1:8:46,135 --> 1:8:48,638
We've got the turning it on,
turning it off here.


1404
1:8:48,638 --> 1:8:50,84
So air is okay.


1405
1:8:50,84 --> 1:8:53,81
- Air good. Fire bad.
- Fire bad.


1406
1:8:53,81 --> 1:8:56,179
Fire bad!


1407
1:8:56,179 --> 1:9:0,65
We've taken an old bicycle--


1408
1:9:0,65 --> 1:9:2,819
- l forgot what it's called.
- Tire.


1409
1:9:2,819 --> 1:9:6,122
Okay. Air goes in,
air goes out.


1410
1:9:6,122 --> 1:9:7,824
lf l was a person
in that wheelchair,


1411
1:9:7,824 --> 1:9:10,927
l might say to myself,
''Why am l going to these lengths


1412
1:9:10,927 --> 1:9:14,464
to please God, who's taken away
my legs to begin with?''


1413
1:9:14,464 --> 1:9:17,834
Okay.


1414
1:9:17,834 --> 1:9:20,2
That would be fascinating.
lt's an elevator.


1415
1:9:20,2 --> 1:9:22,71
Oh, it's a Shabbatavator.


1416
1:9:22,71 --> 1:9:24,173
Let me guess,
you can't push a button...


1417
1:9:24,173 --> 1:9:26,742
- Correct.
- ...on the Sabbath.


1418
1:9:26,742 --> 1:9:30,546
The issues behind the scenes that
people don't see are the real problems.


1419
1:9:30,546 --> 1:9:32,882
An even bigger problem might
be how do you get someone


1420
1:9:32,882 --> 1:9:36,552
to put this in their building if
they're not completely nuts?


1421
1:9:36,552 --> 1:9:39,121
Well, actually, that really
doesn't make a difference.


1422
1:9:39,121 --> 1:9:40,389
Hmm.


1423
1:9:40,389 --> 1:9:42,925
How we define what is
crazy or not crazy


1424
1:9:42,925 --> 1:9:47,53
about religions is ultimately up
to how we define crazy.


1425
1:9:47,53 --> 1:9:50,233
lf you define mental illness
as anyone who hears a voice


1426
1:9:50,233 --> 1:10:11,687
talking to them, then anyone who has
heard the voice of God is crazy.


1427
1:10:11,687 --> 1:10:13,523
She talks about a prophecy


1428
1:10:13,523 --> 1:10:18,327
that these children needed to die.


1429
1:10:18,327 --> 1:10:21,97
The dispatcher asked
''Why did you do this?''


1430
1:10:21,97 --> 1:10:27,336
''l was told to.''
''Who told you?'' ''God.''


1431
1:10:27,336 --> 1:10:29,338
There is nothing


1432
1:10:29,338 --> 1:10:33,42
He may not ask of thee?


1433
1:10:33,42 --> 1:10:35,144
But in layman's terms,
Jesus was nuts.


1434
1:10:35,144 --> 1:10:37,914
Moses-- ''Stay here,
l'm going up


1435
1:10:37,914 --> 1:10:40,49
and getting the 10 Commandments
right from God.''


1436
1:10:40,49 --> 1:10:42,151
You know, 'cause one
thing l've also--


1437
1:10:42,151 --> 1:10:44,787
We didn't have brain-scan technology
back then, so it's a hard to tell.


1438
1:10:44,787 --> 1:10:47,59
l know, but if a guy says he went
up on a mountain and he talked to God,


1439
1:10:47,59 --> 1:10:49,659
and He talked to him
through a burning bush,


1440
1:10:49,659 --> 1:11:9,946
that guy's a cuckoo.


1441
1:11:9,946 --> 1:11:12,315
All those pastors who refer to me


1442
1:11:12,315 --> 1:11:15,318
as the anti-Christ, false prophet,


1443
1:11:15,318 --> 1:11:17,92
it's because they're miserable.


1444
1:11:17,92 --> 1:11:27,229
Anyone who doesn't believe
in me is miserable.


1445
1:11:27,229 --> 1:11:29,865
- My mike is on?
- Yes, sir.


1446
1:11:29,865 --> 1:11:32,201
Okay, who are you Biblically?


1447
1:11:32,201 --> 1:11:36,973
l am Jesus Christ man,
the second coming of Christ, l am.


1448
1:11:36,973 --> 1:11:39,308
The Old Testament speaks
about me clearly


1449
1:11:39,308 --> 1:11:41,1
and the New Testament also.


1450
1:11:41,1 --> 1:11:43,446
- About you personally?
- Yes.


1451
1:11:43,446 --> 1:11:46,882
Not just because you have--
you share the name Jesus?


1452
1:11:46,882 --> 1:11:49,685
- No, not because of that.
- You also share the name Miranda.


1453
1:11:49,685 --> 1:11:51,42
Maybe you're Carmen Miranda.


1454
1:11:51,42 --> 1:11:53,456
Maybe the second coming of her?


1455
1:11:53,456 --> 1:11:58,961
You should have fruit on your head,
instead of fruit in your head.


1456
1:11:58,961 --> 1:12:0,663
Okay. Fuck you.
How's that?


1457
1:12:0,663 --> 1:12:4,1
Why do you think
God chose you?


1458
1:12:4,1 --> 1:12:7,169
Jesus of Nazareth had a wife


1459
1:12:7,169 --> 1:12:10,139
so after they killed him,


1460
1:12:10,139 --> 1:12:14,11
his seed kept going,
maybe through France, Spain,


1461
1:12:14,11 --> 1:12:19,281
and then from Spain,
came to Puerto Rico.


1462
1:12:19,281 --> 1:12:22,652
The bloodline come
from Abraham, Abraham to David,


1463
1:12:22,652 --> 1:12:24,353
David to Jesus of Nazareth,


1464
1:12:24,353 --> 1:12:27,23
Jesus of Nazareth, me.


1465
1:12:27,23 --> 1:12:29,558
Okay, l though a second coming


1466
1:12:29,558 --> 1:12:32,395
was the reincarnation


1467
1:12:32,395 --> 1:12:34,664
of the Christ himself,


1468
1:12:34,664 --> 1:12:36,932
not a descendant of.


1469
1:12:36,932 --> 1:12:38,834
No, he's a descendant.


1470
1:12:38,834 --> 1:12:42,4
Descendant? Oh... but
you don't believe in hell?


1471
1:12:42,4 --> 1:12:44,106
- No.
- Or the Devil?


1472
1:12:44,106 --> 1:12:46,676
- No.
- Or even sin, right?


1473
1:12:46,676 --> 1:12:48,978
No, there's not
a sin any longer.


1474
1:12:48,978 --> 1:12:52,982
What you teach is that
Jesus died for our sins


1475
1:12:52,982 --> 1:12:56,452
and so there's not really
any sinning anymore.


1476
1:12:56,452 --> 1:13:0,89
- No more sin.
- This is like a diet doctor saying,


1477
1:13:0,89 --> 1:13:1,924
- ''Eat anything you want.''
- Right.


1478
1:13:1,924 --> 1:13:4,226
''You don't lose weight,
but it's easy to stick to.''


1479
1:13:4,226 --> 1:13:5,394
That's what l believe, Bill.


1480
1:13:5,394 --> 1:13:7,329
Oh, l know you do.


1481
1:13:7,329 --> 1:13:9,932
And l have many people
who believe in this.


1482
1:13:9,932 --> 1:13:11,934
And yet, you have a little--
you have a little twinkle


1483
1:13:11,934 --> 1:13:13,936
in your eye when say it.


1484
1:13:13,936 --> 1:13:17,6
No, l believe in that.
l believe.


1485
1:13:17,6 --> 1:13:21,1
How do we know? Because lots
of people would like this job.


1486
1:13:21,1 --> 1:13:22,912
How do you get this job
as the second coming?


1487
1:13:22,912 --> 1:13:24,513
lt's not on Craigslist.


1488
1:13:24,513 --> 1:13:27,116
- Yeah.
- l'm guessing. Maybe it is.


1489
1:13:27,116 --> 1:13:28,284
See, two angels--


1490
1:13:28,284 --> 1:13:31,954
Two guys named Angel,
Spanish guys.


1491
1:13:31,954 --> 1:13:33,689
You know what l'm talking about,


1492
1:13:33,689 --> 1:13:36,292
you fucking cockroach!


1493
1:13:36,292 --> 1:13:38,294
- No.
- Oh, actual angels.


1494
1:13:38,294 --> 1:13:40,629
- Two angels came to me...
- Okay.


1495
1:13:40,629 --> 1:13:42,932
...and they told me


1496
1:13:42,932 --> 1:13:45,468
''The Lord of Lords
and King of Kings


1497
1:13:45,468 --> 1:13:48,404
is coming to anoint you
for the ministry tonight.''


1498
1:13:48,404 --> 1:13:51,4
What form did the angels come in?
How tall?


1499
1:13:51,4 --> 1:13:53,75
Little tall and strong.


1500
1:13:53,75 --> 1:13:54,91
Whatever they told me,
l obey.


1501
1:13:54,91 --> 1:13:57,46
l don't wanna mess
with them.


1502
1:13:57,46 --> 1:13:58,614
But l'm just saying,


1503
1:13:58,614 --> 1:14:1,25
it seems that if God wanted


1504
1:14:1,25 --> 1:14:3,586
to communicate something
to the world--


1505
1:14:3,586 --> 1:14:5,755
He's all powerful--


1506
1:14:5,755 --> 1:14:8,891
He would just talk
to the whole world.


1507
1:14:8,891 --> 1:14:12,294
lt always seems
He picks out a prophet in private


1508
1:14:12,294 --> 1:14:15,264
and tells them,
''Okay, you're the prophet.''


1509
1:14:15,264 --> 1:14:17,967
- l am.
- ''You go tell the rest of the world.''


1510
1:14:17,967 --> 1:14:19,735
So we just sort of
have to take it on faith.


1511
1:14:19,735 --> 1:14:21,971
We just sort of
have to believe you.


1512
1:14:21,971 --> 1:14:27,143
Right, yeah, it's true.


1513
1:14:27,143 --> 1:14:30,179
Abraham. Noah.


1514
1:14:30,179 --> 1:14:32,748
Lord, what shall l do?


1515
1:14:32,748 --> 1:14:34,283
Moses,


1516
1:14:34,283 --> 1:14:36,852
climb the mount alone.


1517
1:14:36,852 --> 1:14:39,822
Once again, the Lord had
spoken to Joseph Smith


1518
1:14:39,822 --> 1:14:42,258
as he had to Adam, Abraham,


1519
1:14:42,258 --> 1:14:46,28
Moses, Paul and others.


1520
1:14:46,28 --> 1:14:48,97
l am the first Christian.


1521
1:14:48,97 --> 1:14:51,767
And the rest are really
kind of Jewish, you're saying,


1522
1:14:51,767 --> 1:14:53,836
because they're following a Jew.


1523
1:14:53,836 --> 1:14:55,504
That's it.


1524
1:14:55,504 --> 1:14:57,506
ln fact, they put on the plates--


1525
1:14:57,506 --> 1:15:0,409
they say ''My boss is
a Jewish carpenter.''


1526
1:15:0,409 --> 1:15:3,946
How ridiculous is that?
A Jewish carpenter!


1527
1:15:3,946 --> 1:15:6,448
- lmagine.
- Come on, Jews hire carpenters.


1528
1:15:6,448 --> 1:15:8,117
They don't--


1529
1:15:8,117 --> 1:15:11,453
you know, people say
''l found my calling in life.''


1530
1:15:11,453 --> 1:15:13,722
And it's a good calling.
lt's a nice living.


1531
1:15:13,722 --> 1:15:16,125
People adore you.
Everywhere you go,


1532
1:15:16,125 --> 1:15:18,994
they treat you like Christ,
like you're the Messiah.


1533
1:15:18,994 --> 1:15:22,431
You know, if l discovered
that l was Satan in person,


1534
1:15:22,431 --> 1:15:24,333
l would do a good job, too,


1535
1:15:24,333 --> 1:15:26,836
because l would be
faithful to my calling.


1536
1:15:26,836 --> 1:15:29,138
lt's how you do
your work, isn't it?


1537
1:15:29,138 --> 1:15:31,106
You know, at the end of the day,
whether you're the Messiah


1538
1:15:31,106 --> 1:15:33,609
or you're Satan,
it's loving what you do


1539
1:15:33,609 --> 1:15:35,411
and giving it 100%.


1540
1:15:35,411 --> 1:15:37,379
l give 100%.


1541
1:15:37,379 --> 1:15:41,15
l wasn't born skeptical.


1542
1:15:41,15 --> 1:15:44,32
l was still making deals
with ''God'' when l was 40.


1543
1:15:44,32 --> 1:15:46,255
l remember l quit smoking.


1544
1:15:46,255 --> 1:15:48,691
There was some shitty problem
l had in my life,


1545
1:15:48,691 --> 1:15:50,492
and l made
a deal with God,


1546
1:15:50,492 --> 1:15:52,561
''Okay, if you make
this problem go away,


1547
1:15:52,561 --> 1:15:55,464
l will quit smoking,
and l won't go back on it


1548
1:15:55,464 --> 1:15:58,234
'cause l'd know l'd be going back
on a deal with God.''


1549
1:15:58,234 --> 1:16:0,69
And you know, l gotta say,


1550
1:16:0,69 --> 1:16:2,705
l'm kind of glad l had ''God''


1551
1:16:2,705 --> 1:16:4,44
in my life.


1552
1:16:4,44 --> 1:16:6,942
You are the head


1553
1:16:6,942 --> 1:16:11,38
of the First Universal Church
of Cantheism...


1554
1:16:11,38 --> 1:16:14,16
- Yes.
- ...which is really built around


1555
1:16:14,16 --> 1:16:16,785
- this substance here.
- No.


1556
1:16:16,785 --> 1:16:19,955
No? Okay, l got that wrong.


1557
1:16:19,955 --> 1:16:22,24
But it's built
around smoking this.


1558
1:16:22,24 --> 1:16:24,36
l mean, it has no dogma, right?


1559
1:16:24,36 --> 1:16:26,28
You're not preaching to anybody.
You're not saying


1560
1:16:26,28 --> 1:16:28,797
- you'll save their souls, no rituals.
- No.


1561
1:16:28,797 --> 1:16:30,866
How does this differ
from just getting wasted?


1562
1:16:30,866 --> 1:16:33,35
l mean that
in the best possible way, but--


1563
1:16:33,35 --> 1:16:35,271
l understand
the concept of God,


1564
1:16:35,271 --> 1:16:38,474
a feeling of one
with everything else.


1565
1:16:38,474 --> 1:16:41,11
Do you feel that
every time you smoke pot?


1566
1:16:41,11 --> 1:16:43,279
No.


1567
1:16:43,279 --> 1:16:45,648
Phew! l thought it was just me.


1568
1:16:45,648 --> 1:16:49,285
So why do you think
it's this family of drugs


1569
1:16:49,285 --> 1:16:52,421
that's so good
for opening our minds


1570
1:16:52,421 --> 1:16:54,39
as opposed to ludes, PCP,


1571
1:16:54,39 --> 1:16:59,461
or smashing up your mother's diet pills
and smoking 'em in a pipe?


1572
1:16:59,461 --> 1:17:5,601
l don't know.
l don't know.


1573
1:17:5,601 --> 1:17:7,903
So l did want
to get your thoughts


1574
1:17:7,903 --> 1:17:10,539
about what's going on in this city.
This is your city.


1575
1:17:10,539 --> 1:17:13,475
There's a lot
of controversy with--


1576
1:17:13,475 --> 1:17:15,644
maybe the Dutch
are so tolerant


1577
1:17:15,644 --> 1:17:18,614
that they're now
tolerating intolerance.


1578
1:17:18,614 --> 1:17:21,25
There's a lot of tension
with the Muslim community.


1579
1:17:21,25 --> 1:17:24,453
lt's all religious fundamentalists.


1580
1:17:24,453 --> 1:17:26,889
They already killed
Theo Van Gogh,


1581
1:17:26,889 --> 1:17:30,25
who was a known
television maker.


1582
1:17:30,25 --> 1:17:33,595
This is the spot
where Theo Van Gogh


1583
1:17:33,595 --> 1:17:36,532
- was assassinated?
- This is exactly the spot.


1584
1:17:36,532 --> 1:17:39,101
He was a Dutch filmmaker.
He made a 10-minute film.


1585
1:17:39,101 --> 1:17:42,905
lt was deeply offensive
to Muslims.


1586
1:17:42,905 --> 1:17:46,241
Oh, Allah, you say
that men are the protectors


1587
1:17:46,241 --> 1:17:48,177
and maintainers of women


1588
1:17:48,177 --> 1:17:50,98
because you have given
the one more strength than the other.


1589
1:17:50,98 --> 1:17:52,748
l feel at least once a week,


1590
1:17:52,748 --> 1:17:55,384
the strength of my husband's fist


1591
1:17:55,384 --> 1:17:57,152
on my face.


1592
1:17:57,152 --> 1:17:59,688
Lots of people think
that free speech


1593
1:17:59,688 --> 1:18:4,493
goes right up to this point and then
when you're talking about religion,


1594
1:18:4,493 --> 1:18:8,3
when you're talking
about the Prophet, all bets are off.


1595
1:18:8,3 --> 1:18:10,165
lt goes both ways,
freedom of speech.


1596
1:18:10,165 --> 1:18:12,768
lt goes both ways,
but the people who actually--


1597
1:18:12,768 --> 1:18:16,638
usually do the killing for it
wind up on the Muslim side.


1598
1:18:16,638 --> 1:18:19,675
Do you think that says something
about the different cultures?


1599
1:18:19,675 --> 1:18:22,144
l don't want to have
the image of the Muslims,


1600
1:18:22,144 --> 1:18:23,846
you know, if they don't like
something you say,


1601
1:18:23,846 --> 1:18:26,882
they kill you, because it's not.


1602
1:18:26,882 --> 1:18:30,686
lt was a noisy crowd outside
the Danish embassy in London


1603
1:18:30,686 --> 1:18:34,423
as speakers condemned the cartoons
portraying the Prophet Mohammed.


1604
1:18:34,423 --> 1:18:37,96
l wish l could get
your music in America,


1605
1:18:37,96 --> 1:18:47,569
but considering how controversial
it's been here in England...


1606
1:18:47,569 --> 1:18:49,471
lnitially, when l did the record,


1607
1:18:49,471 --> 1:18:51,707
a lot of people supported it,


1608
1:18:51,707 --> 1:18:54,91
but then,
in the current times that we're in,


1609
1:18:54,91 --> 1:18:56,445
people got really scared.


1610
1:18:56,445 --> 1:18:58,981
lt just shows
the stupidity of society,


1611
1:18:58,981 --> 1:19:2,418
which refuses
to discuss,


1612
1:19:2,418 --> 1:19:5,387
debate things
in an intelligent way.


1613
1:19:5,387 --> 1:19:6,955
And l don't except that.


1614
1:19:6,955 --> 1:19:8,857
l just put my middle finger up.


1615
1:19:8,857 --> 1:19:11,26
One of your big gripes--
and it's a valid one--


1616
1:19:11,26 --> 1:19:14,663
you keep saying that--
in fact, let me read your quote.


1617
1:19:14,663 --> 1:19:16,665
You said, ''Anyone worried
about what l'm saying


1618
1:19:16,665 --> 1:19:20,436
should get involved in the debate.
You are allowed to dissent.


1619
1:19:20,436 --> 1:19:22,738
- That is a right.''
- Yeah.


1620
1:19:22,738 --> 1:19:26,375
But is that a right
in lslam, to dissent?


1621
1:19:26,375 --> 1:19:28,51
Of course it is. Why do you think
there's so many schools of thought?


1622
1:19:28,51 --> 1:19:32,281
- Why do you think there's--
- lt wasn't a right for Salman Rushdie.


1623
1:19:32,281 --> 1:19:34,283
The demonstrators set off
from Hyde Park,


1624
1:19:34,283 --> 1:19:36,985
bringing much
of central London to a standstill.


1625
1:19:36,985 --> 1:19:40,222
Their hatred focused
on Salman Rushdie and his book.


1626
1:19:40,222 --> 1:19:43,92
The mullahs pressed home
their message in thousands of mosques--


1627
1:19:43,92 --> 1:19:45,127
Salman Rushdie must be killed.


1628
1:19:45,127 --> 1:19:47,863
See, Salman Rushdie
was there to provoke,


1629
1:19:47,863 --> 1:19:50,699
insult, and he did it
intentionally, right?


1630
1:19:50,699 --> 1:19:52,401
But should you die
for that?


1631
1:19:52,401 --> 1:19:54,77
No no, well, l mean,
like, that was--


1632
1:19:54,77 --> 1:19:56,505
you know, it's easy
for you to say


1633
1:19:56,505 --> 1:19:58,64
things are kind of
in black and white.


1634
1:19:58,64 --> 1:20:1,43
They're more complex than that.


1635
1:20:1,43 --> 1:20:3,278
There's emotions and passions


1636
1:20:3,278 --> 1:20:5,314
and philosophy involved


1637
1:20:5,314 --> 1:20:7,95
- and all that stuff.
- You know, all you gotta say is


1638
1:20:7,95 --> 1:20:11,487
it's wrong for someone
to have to suffer a death threat


1639
1:20:11,487 --> 1:20:14,56
- for writing a book.
- Well, hang on.


1640
1:20:14,56 --> 1:20:15,591
But apparently, it's more
complicated than that.


1641
1:20:15,591 --> 1:20:18,36
Well, it is because--
but l mean, Western--


1642
1:20:18,36 --> 1:20:20,796
We'll never see
eye to eye there,


1643
1:20:20,796 --> 1:20:23,165
but you want that
protection for yourself.


1644
1:20:23,165 --> 1:20:25,167
No, l think
these debates are a lot--


1645
1:20:25,167 --> 1:20:29,37
l'm willing to discuss 'em
in terms of facts and not fictions.


1646
1:20:29,37 --> 1:20:30,606
When you disagree with me,
it's a fiction.


1647
1:20:30,606 --> 1:20:32,508
- No no.
- You have the truth


1648
1:20:32,508 --> 1:20:34,42
- and l have the fiction.
- No, l don't have the truth.


1649
1:20:34,42 --> 1:20:35,944
But you don't see that
there's a fundamental hypocrisy


1650
1:20:35,944 --> 1:20:38,8
of you asking
for the right to dissent


1651
1:20:38,8 --> 1:20:40,215
and somebody else
getting a death threat?


1652
1:20:40,215 --> 1:20:48,924
No no, 'cause my dissent is
to stop the madness.


1653
1:20:48,924 --> 1:20:50,993
l'm here with Geert Wilders
here in The Hague,


1654
1:20:50,993 --> 1:20:52,661
which of course is
home to the World Court,


1655
1:20:52,661 --> 1:20:54,496
but also to the Dutch Parliament.


1656
1:20:54,496 --> 1:20:57,666
You are taking
a kind of hard line here


1657
1:20:57,666 --> 1:20:59,401
in the Netherlands.


1658
1:20:59,401 --> 1:21:2,738
lslam is, according to me,
a violent religion.


1659
1:21:2,738 --> 1:21:4,74
The Koran is a violent book


1660
1:21:4,74 --> 1:21:6,742
and Mohammed was
a violent prophet.


1661
1:21:6,742 --> 1:21:9,244
Do you think lslam wants
to take over the world?


1662
1:21:9,244 --> 1:21:11,446
- They don't even make...
- Right right.


1663
1:21:11,446 --> 1:21:13,182
...a secret about it.


1664
1:21:13,182 --> 1:21:14,75
We are infidels.


1665
1:21:14,75 --> 1:21:18,2
l mean, we should either become
lslamic or we should be killed.


1666
1:21:18,2 --> 1:21:20,155
This is what they say.
This is what they are proud of.


1667
1:21:20,155 --> 1:21:22,524
Okay, we're here at Habibi Ana.


1668
1:21:22,524 --> 1:21:24,593
- Did l say that right?
- Yeah.


1669
1:21:24,593 --> 1:21:26,562
You guys, really--
l mean,


1670
1:21:26,562 --> 1:21:28,53
gay Muslim activists,


1671
1:21:28,53 --> 1:21:33,735
that is a very rare job description.
You guys have balls.


1672
1:21:33,735 --> 1:21:35,47
How big is
the gay community--


1673
1:21:35,47 --> 1:21:38,707
the gay Muslim community
here in Amsterdam?


1674
1:21:38,707 --> 1:21:41,43
Or is this it?


1675
1:21:41,43 --> 1:21:45,47
l mean, l'm guessing,
Thursday isn't--


1676
1:21:45,47 --> 1:21:47,783
isn't gay night here.


1677
1:21:47,783 --> 1:21:50,385
l hope you guys find
each other attractive,


1678
1:21:50,385 --> 1:21:52,521
'cause otherwise--


1679
1:21:52,521 --> 1:21:53,956
you don't feel afraid?


1680
1:21:53,956 --> 1:21:55,39
Here in Holland l'm not,


1681
1:21:55,39 --> 1:21:57,893
but when l came from my country,
l was very afraid.


1682
1:21:57,893 --> 1:21:59,228
There was an article of law:


1683
1:21:59,228 --> 1:22:1,43
Punish the gay
for one year just because he's gay.


1684
1:22:1,43 --> 1:22:4,32
- Just being gay can get you a year.
- Just being gay.


1685
1:22:4,32 --> 1:22:7,35
Same as Alabama.


1686
1:22:7,35 --> 1:22:9,871
What l learned is that
they're not really--


1687
1:22:9,871 --> 1:22:12,541
they're not specific
against homosexuality.


1688
1:22:12,541 --> 1:22:15,143
They're not specific against,
in other words,


1689
1:22:15,143 --> 1:22:17,613
the desire
of a man for a man.


1690
1:22:17,613 --> 1:22:21,149
What they are against
is specific behavior,


1691
1:22:21,149 --> 1:22:22,951
like anal sex.


1692
1:22:22,951 --> 1:22:27,89
They don't say homosexuality,
heterosexuality.


1693
1:22:27,89 --> 1:22:29,925
They just don't want you doing it
in the naughty place,


1694
1:22:29,925 --> 1:22:31,526
which l guess,


1695
1:22:31,526 --> 1:22:34,263
if you put that out
of the picture in homosexuality,


1696
1:22:34,263 --> 1:22:39,635
what do you have left?
Just the blowjob.


1697
1:22:39,635 --> 1:22:41,236
What do you think
when people say


1698
1:22:41,236 --> 1:22:43,538
it affects your memory,


1699
1:22:43,538 --> 1:22:45,774
especially your
short-term memory?


1700
1:22:45,774 --> 1:22:49,11
- lt does.
- And what do you think when people say


1701
1:22:49,11 --> 1:22:52,481
that it affects your memory,
your short-term memory?


1702
1:22:52,481 --> 1:22:56,618
lt does.


1703
1:22:56,618 --> 1:23:0,122
- l like my hat.
- lt's good. You look good, too.


1704
1:23:0,122 --> 1:23:2,291
l think l do.
l think l might adopt this look.


1705
1:23:2,291 --> 1:23:3,325
Yes.


1706
1:23:3,325 --> 1:23:5,594
ls there a reason
why you have a black hat


1707
1:23:5,594 --> 1:23:7,162
and l have a white hat?


1708
1:23:7,162 --> 1:23:9,531
We have any color you like.


1709
1:23:9,531 --> 1:23:12,534
So l bought this.
l like it myself


1710
1:23:12,534 --> 1:23:14,77
because l like the color.


1711
1:23:14,77 --> 1:23:18,607
There is a lot of tension
in the last five years or so.


1712
1:23:18,607 --> 1:23:22,644
ls lslam a threat
to Dutch values?


1713
1:23:22,644 --> 1:23:25,18
lslam is preaching,


1714
1:23:25,18 --> 1:23:27,215
above all, peace.


1715
1:23:27,215 --> 1:23:51,74
Peace, peace and peace.


1716
1:23:51,74 --> 1:23:54,176
The name lslam means peace.


1717
1:23:54,176 --> 1:23:56,511
And yet it is involved
in a lot of war and violence.


1718
1:23:56,511 --> 1:23:58,413
Yeah, it's just all politics.


1719
1:23:58,413 --> 1:24:0,315
- Nothing to do with religion?
- No no.


1720
1:24:0,315 --> 1:24:1,983
- No?
- No, sir.


1721
1:24:1,983 --> 1:24:3,985
- lt's political.
- lt's politics.


1722
1:24:3,985 --> 1:24:5,821
Seems to be
a lot of passages


1723
1:24:5,821 --> 1:24:8,256
that say the infidel


1724
1:24:8,256 --> 1:24:11,593
is not the equal
of the believer.


1725
1:24:11,593 --> 1:24:13,695
The infidel will die in hell.


1726
1:24:13,695 --> 1:24:16,698
Don't feel bad
about hating the infidel.


1727
1:24:16,698 --> 1:24:19,868
- No.
- No?


1728
1:24:19,868 --> 1:24:21,903
Boy, l've got
bad information.


1729
1:24:21,903 --> 1:24:23,205
Yes, you have.
l think so.


1730
1:24:23,205 --> 1:24:25,841
- No no no no no.
- No no no no.


1731
1:24:25,841 --> 1:24:27,442
- No no no no.
- No.


1732
1:24:27,442 --> 1:24:30,112
No? No. l'm wrong
about everything.


1733
1:24:30,112 --> 1:24:33,882
The way l perceive things in the Koran
is not about killing infidels.


1734
1:24:33,882 --> 1:24:36,685
- But you have read it in there?
- Of course l've read the Koran.


1735
1:24:36,685 --> 1:24:39,554
You've read those passages, and what
did you think when you read them?


1736
1:24:39,554 --> 1:24:42,124
No, but l explain those
passages within the time


1737
1:24:42,124 --> 1:24:44,259
in which they emerged
in the world.


1738
1:24:44,259 --> 1:24:45,794
That's not how people
read holy books.


1739
1:24:45,794 --> 1:24:47,429
People don't read
holy books and go,


1740
1:24:47,429 --> 1:24:50,132
''Well, that was good for then.''
People who read holy books and go,


1741
1:24:50,132 --> 1:24:52,334
''This is the word of God.
lt's forever!''


1742
1:24:52,334 --> 1:24:55,27
- No, l don't agree.
- That's how most people do it.


1743
1:24:55,27 --> 1:24:57,906
l just don't buy it
that these guys are


1744
1:24:57,906 --> 1:25:0,208
in this state of denial.


1745
1:25:0,208 --> 1:25:2,944
l think they're just
in a state of denial


1746
1:25:2,944 --> 1:25:4,98
to an outsider.


1747
1:25:4,98 --> 1:25:7,749
They will not admit
anything is wrong


1748
1:25:7,749 --> 1:25:10,485
with their culture
to an outsider.


1749
1:25:10,485 --> 1:25:12,621
Muslims were imperialists


1750
1:25:12,621 --> 1:25:15,39
in the century
after Mohammed's death.


1751
1:25:15,39 --> 1:25:18,93
They conquered most
of the known world


1752
1:25:18,93 --> 1:25:19,828
in one century.


1753
1:25:19,828 --> 1:25:22,798
Yeah, it is possible.


1754
1:25:22,798 --> 1:25:24,733
You call it conquer.


1755
1:25:24,733 --> 1:25:26,501
l think they were trying


1756
1:25:26,501 --> 1:25:29,504
to spread lslam.


1757
1:25:29,504 --> 1:25:33,141
Well, they were, but they weren't doing
it by singing ''Kumbaya.''


1758
1:25:33,141 --> 1:25:36,244
Excuse me.


1759
1:25:36,244 --> 1:25:37,979
Sorry.


1760
1:25:37,979 --> 1:25:43,18
Oh, that 21st century's
always busting in.


1761
1:25:43,18 --> 1:25:45,86
l'm going to shut it off.


1762
1:25:45,86 --> 1:25:53,795
l love it that he's got ''Kashmir''
as his ringtone.


1763
1:25:53,795 --> 1:25:55,831
Okay, l shut it off.


1764
1:25:55,831 --> 1:26:0,202
- Sorry, l was--
- Yeah...


1765
1:26:0,202 --> 1:26:3,939
Politics, okay.


1766
1:26:3,939 --> 1:26:6,975
Do you think it's possible
that when we're on something


1767
1:26:6,975 --> 1:26:8,844
like marijuana
or mushrooms


1768
1:26:8,844 --> 1:26:11,947
and believe we're having a very
spiritual experience,


1769
1:26:11,947 --> 1:26:14,516
that we're just high?


1770
1:26:14,516 --> 1:26:17,652
- lt's-- it's--
- Oh, look out your head's on fire!


1771
1:26:17,652 --> 1:26:19,888
Boy, talk about
the light bulb going off,


1772
1:26:19,888 --> 1:26:23,391
- that was your whole head.
- l don't like candles behind me.


1773
1:26:23,391 --> 1:26:26,628
No. Oh, look,
l found another joint.


1774
1:26:26,628 --> 1:26:30,65
Uh-oh.


1775
1:26:30,65 --> 1:26:32,534
Can we get closer?


1776
1:26:32,534 --> 1:26:51,887
That is one hell of a wall.


1777
1:26:51,887 --> 1:26:53,288
This is the Dome of the Rock?


1778
1:26:53,288 --> 1:27:1,663
This is the Dome of the Rock.
According to lslam...


1779
1:27:1,663 --> 1:27:10,171
On a horse?


1780
1:27:10,171 --> 1:27:12,34
He went to heaven on the horse?


1781
1:27:12,34 --> 1:27:38,33
Why is it holy for the Jews?


1782
1:27:38,33 --> 1:27:40,502
A rock. The Kaaba?


1783
1:27:40,502 --> 1:27:44,439
lsn't that--


1784
1:27:44,439 --> 1:27:47,576
Stone, rock, the same thing.


1785
1:27:47,576 --> 1:27:52,747
Why is that holy?


1786
1:27:52,747 --> 1:27:53,815
Paradise.


1787
1:27:53,815 --> 1:28:1,122
Could the rock itself have been
what we know now to be like a meteor?


1788
1:28:1,122 --> 1:28:3,792
But does it make a difference
that we now understand


1789
1:28:3,792 --> 1:28:6,561
what a meteor is?


1790
1:28:6,561 --> 1:28:7,629
Yes, right.


1791
1:28:7,629 --> 1:28:9,297
Okay.


1792
1:28:9,297 --> 1:28:11,299
This is the Mount
of Olives.


1793
1:28:11,299 --> 1:28:14,569
A lot of Orthodox Jews want
to be buried here,


1794
1:28:14,569 --> 1:28:17,5
'cause they believe that
when the Messiah comes,


1795
1:28:17,5 --> 1:28:19,14
he will raise them from
the dead and march them through


1796
1:28:19,14 --> 1:28:22,444
that golden gate
and onto the Temple Mount,


1797
1:28:22,444 --> 1:28:26,114
which is why the Muslims
have walled up the gate.


1798
1:28:26,114 --> 1:28:28,583
The better to keep out
the Jewish Messiah


1799
1:28:28,583 --> 1:28:31,19
and his kosher zombies
from getting in.


1800
1:28:31,19 --> 1:28:34,956
Although you'd think that
if you had the power to raise the dead,


1801
1:28:34,956 --> 1:28:39,527
you'd have the power
to jump a fence.


1802
1:28:39,527 --> 1:28:41,196
l thought l would not be allowed


1803
1:28:41,196 --> 1:28:43,798
to walk in a mosque.


1804
1:28:43,798 --> 1:28:45,3
l thought only someone of your faith


1805
1:28:45,3 --> 1:29:1,683
was allowed to do that.


1806
1:29:1,683 --> 1:29:5,353
Why is he angry?


1807
1:29:5,353 --> 1:29:13,662
They're angry that
you're talking to me?


1808
1:29:13,662 --> 1:29:16,364
Women in your culture


1809
1:29:16,364 --> 1:29:18,867
seem not to be as equal


1810
1:29:18,867 --> 1:29:23,171
to the man as they
are in our culture.


1811
1:29:23,171 --> 1:29:26,141
Yes.


1812
1:29:26,141 --> 1:29:28,61
l talked to a Muslim scholar today.


1813
1:29:28,61 --> 1:29:41,56
And he said that Mohammed
had a meeting here.


1814
1:29:41,56 --> 1:29:44,359
Mohammed never set his foot


1815
1:29:44,359 --> 1:29:47,729
on that Temple Mount,
not even one foot.


1816
1:29:47,729 --> 1:29:50,398
Never ever.


1817
1:29:50,398 --> 1:30:4,679
He was never in the land
of lsrael, that's a historical fact.


1818
1:30:4,679 --> 1:30:7,82
l think even
l understand that.


1819
1:30:7,82 --> 1:30:10,852
Why can't the people
of the different faiths get along?


1820
1:30:10,852 --> 1:30:14,856
All three religions
consider the same site


1821
1:30:14,856 --> 1:30:18,693
to be holy.


1822
1:30:18,693 --> 1:30:21,229
ls it not because it was
conquered many times?


1823
1:30:21,229 --> 1:30:25,266
- Yes.
- lt was conquered first by King David,


1824
1:30:25,266 --> 1:30:27,268
and then later by
the armies coming out


1825
1:30:27,268 --> 1:30:30,138
of the Arabian Desert.


1826
1:30:30,138 --> 1:30:31,873
- lt changed hands during the crusades.
- We had the Romans.


1827
1:30:31,873 --> 1:30:37,245
We had the Byzantines.
We had the Persians.


1828
1:30:37,245 --> 1:30:40,48
There's more than
one mosque in the world


1829
1:30:40,48 --> 1:30:42,984
that used to be a church,
and before that was a temple.


1830
1:30:42,984 --> 1:30:46,454
Because it's a lot easier
just to change the sign on the top


1831
1:30:46,454 --> 1:30:47,922
and say
''under new management''


1832
1:30:47,922 --> 1:30:50,558
than it is to change
the whole building.


1833
1:30:50,558 --> 1:30:52,56
l worked a lot
of comedy clubs in the '80s


1834
1:30:52,56 --> 1:30:55,463
that still had
the disco ball on the ceiling.


1835
1:30:55,463 --> 1:30:57,966
And in the '90s,
they became strip clubs


1836
1:30:57,966 --> 1:31:0,602
and now
they're a Starbucks.


1837
1:31:0,602 --> 1:31:4,606
l've come today to the village
of Cerne Abbas in Southern England


1838
1:31:4,606 --> 1:31:8,109
to show you something
completely different.


1839
1:31:8,109 --> 1:31:11,79
lt's in the shape
of a giant naked man


1840
1:31:11,79 --> 1:31:14,415
with a sizable erection--
well, sizable for England.


1841
1:31:14,415 --> 1:31:15,95
Some people think
that this means


1842
1:31:15,95 --> 1:31:19,12
that there is a giant actually
buried under that hill.


1843
1:31:19,12 --> 1:31:21,122
Others think it has something
to do with crop circles


1844
1:31:21,122 --> 1:31:24,225
or ancient space visitors
or Druids,


1845
1:31:24,225 --> 1:31:26,227
but nobody really knows.


1846
1:31:26,227 --> 1:31:28,763
And that's what
l find fascinating about this,


1847
1:31:28,763 --> 1:31:31,432
is that it doesn't
really mean anything.


1848
1:31:31,432 --> 1:31:34,269
The locals have been
maintaining it for centuries,


1849
1:31:34,269 --> 1:31:36,337
and they don't
really know why.


1850
1:31:36,337 --> 1:31:38,406
They just do it because
they've always done it,


1851
1:31:38,406 --> 1:31:40,642
and isn't that
religion for you?


1852
1:31:40,642 --> 1:31:43,978
Sometimes you kneel,
sometimes you fast


1853
1:31:43,978 --> 1:31:46,8
and sometimes
you go up on the hill


1854
1:31:46,8 --> 1:31:49,184
and you cut the grass
around the giant space penis.


1855
1:31:49,184 --> 1:31:51,352
Do you believe,
as so many Christians do nowadays,


1856
1:31:51,352 --> 1:31:53,354
that the world will end?


1857
1:31:53,354 --> 1:31:56,391
l think we are in the end times.
There are many many signs.


1858
1:31:56,391 --> 1:31:58,827
The world as we know it
will come to an end.


1859
1:31:58,827 --> 1:32:0,328
And beyond that,


1860
1:32:0,328 --> 1:32:6,501
there will be the glorious
second coming of Jesus Christ.


1861
1:32:6,501 --> 1:32:9,17
lt seems peaceful,


1862
1:32:9,17 --> 1:32:12,44
but this is the very spot where
a lot of Christians believe


1863
1:32:12,44 --> 1:32:14,175
life on earth will end.


1864
1:32:14,175 --> 1:32:16,644
The irony of religion
is that because


1865
1:32:16,644 --> 1:32:19,38
of its power to divert man


1866
1:32:19,38 --> 1:32:21,783
to destructive courses,


1867
1:32:21,783 --> 1:32:24,919
the world actually
could come to an end.


1868
1:32:24,919 --> 1:32:27,555
A lot of people
in this country believe


1869
1:32:27,555 --> 1:32:28,99
in end times.


1870
1:32:28,99 --> 1:32:31,659
There will be this great
reckoning, the Rapture.


1871
1:32:31,659 --> 1:32:41,436
- Do you believe that?
- l do.


1872
1:32:41,436 --> 1:32:44,38
But if you believe that the world is
gonna come to an end,


1873
1:32:44,38 --> 1:32:46,4
and perhaps any day now,


1874
1:32:46,4 --> 1:32:48,743
does it not drain
one's motivation


1875
1:32:48,743 --> 1:33:2,223
to improve life on earth
while we're here?


1876
1:33:2,223 --> 1:33:4,926
The plain fact is,
religion must die


1877
1:33:4,926 --> 1:33:7,128
for mankind to live.


1878
1:33:7,128 --> 1:33:10,98
The hour is getting very late
to be able to indulge


1879
1:33:10,98 --> 1:33:13,768
in having key decisions made
by religious people,


1880
1:33:13,768 --> 1:33:16,938
by irrationalists, by those
who would steer the ship of state


1881
1:33:16,938 --> 1:33:19,941
not by a compass,
but by the equivalent


1882
1:33:19,941 --> 1:33:22,377
of reading the entrails
of a chicken.


1883
1:33:22,377 --> 1:33:24,746
George Bush prayed
a lot about lraq,


1884
1:33:24,746 --> 1:33:26,614
but he didn't learn
a lot about it.


1885
1:33:26,614 --> 1:33:28,116
l don't know that much
about politics,


1886
1:33:28,116 --> 1:33:29,751
l'll vote for President Bush
because of his faith.


1887
1:33:29,751 --> 1:33:34,55
Faith means making
a virtue out of not thinking.


1888
1:33:34,55 --> 1:33:35,723
lt's nothing to brag about.


1889
1:33:35,723 --> 1:33:38,593
And those who preach faith
and enable and elevate it


1890
1:33:38,593 --> 1:33:41,262
are our intellectual slaveholders,


1891
1:33:41,262 --> 1:33:43,598
keeping mankind in a bondage


1892
1:33:43,598 --> 1:33:45,633
to fantasy and nonsense


1893
1:33:45,633 --> 1:33:47,468
that has spawned and justified


1894
1:33:47,468 --> 1:33:50,638
so much lunacy and destruction.


1895
1:33:50,638 --> 1:33:53,975
Religion is dangerous
because it allows human beings


1896
1:33:53,975 --> 1:33:55,476
who don't have all the answers


1897
1:33:55,476 --> 1:33:57,578
to think that they do.


1898
1:33:57,578 --> 1:33:59,58
Most people would think
it's wonderful when someone says,


1899
1:33:59,58 --> 1:34:2,817
''l'm willing, Lord.
l'll do whatever You want me to do.''


1900
1:34:2,817 --> 1:34:6,955
Except that since there
are no gods actually talking to us,


1901
1:34:6,955 --> 1:34:10,625
that void is filled in by people
with their own corruptions,


1902
1:34:10,625 --> 1:34:14,162
- limitations and agendas.
- lt's going to happen,


1903
1:34:14,162 --> 1:34:16,23
and l'm not saying
necessarily nuclear--


1904
1:34:16,23 --> 1:34:17,632
The Lord didn't say nuclear--


1905
1:34:17,632 --> 1:34:19,834
but l do believe it'll
be something like that.


1906
1:34:19,834 --> 1:34:21,602
And anyone who tells you
they know--


1907
1:34:21,602 --> 1:34:24,639
they just know
what happens when you die,


1908
1:34:24,639 --> 1:34:26,574
l promise you, you don't.


1909
1:34:26,574 --> 1:34:29,944
How can l be so sure?
Because l don't know,


1910
1:34:29,944 --> 1:34:33,181
and you do not possess
mental powers that l do not.


1911
1:34:33,181 --> 1:34:35,817
The only appropriate attitude
for man to have


1912
1:34:35,817 --> 1:34:38,319
about the big questions


1913
1:34:38,319 --> 1:34:40,722
is not the arrogant certitude


1914
1:34:40,722 --> 1:34:42,79
that is the hallmark of religion,


1915
1:34:42,79 --> 1:34:45,793
but doubt. Doubt is humble,


1916
1:34:45,793 --> 1:34:47,662
and that's what
man needs to be,


1917
1:34:47,662 --> 1:34:51,366
considering that human history
is just a litany


1918
1:34:51,366 --> 1:34:54,402
of getting shit dead wrong.


1919
1:34:54,402 --> 1:34:56,904
Jesus is coming back
to rescue the Jews,


1920
1:34:56,904 --> 1:34:59,34
because he is
the only one that can.


1921
1:34:59,34 --> 1:35:1,843
The believer goes in the paradise.


1922
1:35:1,843 --> 1:35:5,213
Unbeliever, they will go to hell.


1923
1:35:5,213 --> 1:35:8,583
The Jews are the only reason
that l am a Christian.


1924
1:35:8,583 --> 1:35:10,718
- l love them.
- But you're not gonna take them


1925
1:35:10,718 --> 1:35:13,354
- to heaven with you, are you?
- l'm gonna go in the Rapture,


1926
1:35:13,354 --> 1:35:26,334
and l'm gonna come back
on a white horse.


1927
1:35:26,334 --> 1:35:29,404
So you think Jesus
will end this earth at some point,


1928
1:35:29,404 --> 1:35:31,72
maybe in your lifetime?


1929
1:35:31,72 --> 1:35:33,74
One always hopes.
This is a sign, and that is a sign.


1930
1:35:33,74 --> 1:35:35,209
lf a nuclear bomb went off,


1931
1:35:35,209 --> 1:35:38,79
and it seemed like that was
exactly what it had said,


1932
1:35:38,79 --> 1:35:40,581
balls of fire or something,


1933
1:35:40,581 --> 1:35:42,55
you wouldn't look on that
as necessarily a bad thing.


1934
1:35:42,55 --> 1:35:44,218
l know l'll be with God.


1935
1:35:44,218 --> 1:35:46,22
This is why rational people,


1936
1:35:46,22 --> 1:35:47,889
anti-religionists,


1937
1:35:47,889 --> 1:35:49,891
must end their timidity
and come out of the closet


1938
1:35:49,891 --> 1:35:51,726
and assert themselves.


1939
1:35:51,726 --> 1:35:54,962
And those who consider themselves
only moderately religious


1940
1:35:54,962 --> 1:35:57,65
really need to look
in the mirror and realize


1941
1:35:57,65 --> 1:35:59,7
that the solace and comfort
that religion brings you


1942
1:35:59,7 --> 1:36:2,537
actually comes
at a terrible price.


1943
1:36:2,537 --> 1:36:5,606
lt says in the last days
there'll be wars, rumors of wars.


1944
1:36:5,606 --> 1:36:7,875
The Bible prophesies
from the Book of Revelation--


1945
1:36:7,875 --> 1:36:9,911
they're going to be fulfilled!


1946
1:36:9,911 --> 1:36:11,913
Can this be accomplished
without violence?


1947
1:36:11,913 --> 1:36:15,116
- No.
- lslam ruling the world,


1948
1:36:15,116 --> 1:36:16,451
global jihad.


1949
1:36:16,451 --> 1:36:18,86
- Who will win out?
- We'll win.


1950
1:36:18,86 --> 1:36:30,231
That's for God to decide
on Judgment Day.


1951
1:36:30,231 --> 1:36:33,501
lf you belonged to a political
party or a social club


1952
1:36:33,501 --> 1:36:36,904
that was tied
to as much bigotry, misogyny,


1953
1:36:36,904 --> 1:36:38,673
homophobia, violence


1954
1:36:38,673 --> 1:36:40,942
and sheer ignorance
as religion is,


1955
1:36:40,942 --> 1:36:42,543
you'd resign in protest.


1956
1:36:42,543 --> 1:36:45,12
To do otherwise is
to be an enabler,


1957
1:36:45,12 --> 1:36:46,848
a Mafia wife,


1958
1:36:46,848 --> 1:36:49,617
with the true devils of extremism


1959
1:36:49,617 --> 1:36:51,85
that draw their legitimacy


1960
1:36:51,85 --> 1:36:53,488
from the billions
of their fellow travelers.


1961
1:36:53,488 --> 1:36:57,191
lf the world does come
to an end here or wherever,


1962
1:36:57,191 --> 1:37:0,328
or if it limps into the future,
decimated by the effects


1963
1:37:0,328 --> 1:37:3,431
of a religion-inspired
nuclear terrorism,


1964
1:37:3,431 --> 1:37:5,633
let's remember
what the real problem was:


1965
1:37:5,633 --> 1:37:8,803
That we learned how
to precipitate mass death


1966
1:37:8,803 --> 1:37:11,672
before we got past
the neurological disorder


1967
1:37:11,672 --> 1:37:14,75
of wishing for it.


1968
1:37:14,75 --> 1:37:20,114
That's it. Grow up or die.


1969
1:37:20,114 --> 1:40:46,153
We are in a conflict
between good and evil.


1970
1:40:46,153 --> 1:40:48,756
See you in heaven.


1971
1:40:48,756 --> 1:40:51,792
Who knows?


1972
1:40:51,792 --> 1:42:51,792
Yeah, exactly.
