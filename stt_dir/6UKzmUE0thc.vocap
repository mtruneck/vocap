###79 all with breathtaking view
###94 but might you be chu is no ordinary city
###97 started amongst its terraces uh... enigmatic structures
###101 magnificent temples somehow linked with the sun
###105 undergrads and disturbing
###107 perhaps
###109 they provide tantalizing clues as to why anyone would build such poor beating
###114 terrain
###119 the sites selected is a particularly difficult one just remote technical
###123 standpoint
###125 architect vince lee believes that no one would choose to be okay
###129 without good reason
###131 there's very little workspaces just on a very sharp
###134 leverage
###135 there's almost no flatlands
###138 so why would anyone built
###140 in this impossible locations
###142 what drove much of peaches makers to construct a city
###148 on says lying in the forging oven and cry

###231 he embarked upon a campaign to conquer neighboring nations
###235 after cookies military might
###237 quickly prevails
###239 within his lifetime he laid the groundwork for an empire that would
###242 stretch up and down the pacific coast of south america
###249 i think of him as a sort of alexander the great the andes
###253 alter and explorer peter frost has traced income history for thirty years
###260 press secretary was the man
###261 pretending 'cause from regional power and the cost of value into an empire the
###267 biggest and by the america's ever saw

###276 the empire of include would come undone modality of more than ten million people
###282 but you could keep order the series of massive
###285 dates that would help is on the control
###287 this box territory
###289 but military engineering was any part of the empress grandparent
###296 such a cutie also plan to stay
###298 calculus city to demonstrate his policy
###301 new status
###303 much of that you can accommodate up to one thousand people
###306 yet it was built higher in the andes mountains huntington sixty kilometers
###311 from the center of his empire
###316 some experts think it was a royal retreat
###320 the ruling paradigms have it at the moment
###323 is that this was a winter palace
###327 of the past pretty
###329 and he held his court here for two or three months during the winter
###333 the peter frost believes this theory is too limited to seize it just slip into
###338 thinking european you know

###373 that gardening he was the leader of the religion
###376 he was considered to be sending divine
###378 or fully designed and the son of the sun
###382 analysis formal position within the inca empire
###386 as so allot of his
###388 activity must have been a religious
###392 that much impeaching researchers have identified a unique combination of
###395 natural features to create a religious phenomenon known as axis mundi
###401 a secret sent
###405 the site is a spiritual union of the sky

###423 who's perfect alignment in the courtroom signifies the start of the hottest
###431 much happy to be surrounded by natural features imbued with spiritual sickness
###437 making it a unique place perpetual kruti to worship and communion with the calls
###455 now that patrick routine pictures in this site for his spiritual retreat
###459 his engineers mia mortals
###462 had to achieve the vision affect god impressed
###466 i think they are ever probably decide well nevertheless
###469 that's where i want my
###471 noted
###472 palace it so it's up to you guys to figure out a do it
###475 for decades vince lee has wrestled with the mystery of how they can comfortably
###480 system
###483 the terrain is a jungle covered richer fractured iraq at an altitude of two
###487 thousand four hundred and fifty meters
###491 how detach a coaches engineers tame dislocation
###494 how to take warren
###496 tons of rock with only the most primitive of tours
###500 power to protect the site from the heavy rains earthquakes
###504 the threatened descended tumbling into the river below
###515 might you be chu is a truly spectacular sight
###518 but its location caused huge problems for its buildings
###524 the ridges uneven
###525 strewn with fractured and broken ground
###529 sheer cliffs plunge down to the forests below
###534 each year
###534 torrential storms conduct two hundred centimeters of rain onto the
###537 mountainside
###539 it is also prone to earthquakes
###546 it's landslides caused by these conditions could have carried the city
###550 away
###555 as they began clearing the meant to be true site
###558 the time is needed to work out a way to bank of the city to a place designed by
###562 nature to repent of humans
###568 they're spectacular solution is clear to see today
###572 terraces hundreds of them carved into the slopes of much of peaches
###582 they hoped you buy an area roughly the size of twelve football pitches
###589 these terraces cobb usable space from the mounting
###592 uncontrolled runoff prevent erosion
###595 that you can use these fields to grow food than ceremonial crops
###600 the terrace waltz also provided decadent benefit
###612 during the day they absorb heat from the side
###615 but tonight the walls radiates warmth into the bathroom which would have
###619 protected the crops
###625 but the terraces had an even more important function
###628 reinforcing the slowed
###630 which pulls away at a gradient of up to fifty percent
###635 the secret is in the design of the terror schools
###639 these walls a slipped back
###640 all packed with at about
###642 five degree angle
###644 bracing the hillside by pushing against it
###646 and channeling the weight of the soul
###648 into the ground below
###651 the terraces were critical to support the construction of hundreds of
###654 structure
###655 someone mountain slopes
###660 and that is more to the status is than meets the eye
###663 recent excavations repeal one of the hidden secrets of touch equities
###667 engineer
###670 sixty percent of mucho teacher is underground
###674 after eating up the terrain
###676 clearing the rock
###677 impacted in crevices
###679 uncertainties engineer
###680 as caffeine a download
###682 system from swine
###694 they put them on stands at the bottom
###696 then increasingly smaller stands almost immediately
###699 continue to surface
###705 and then they added sametime homeless
###707 and tops
###710 this ingenious design gave the waltz a solid foundation
###714 and the smaller stones on talked with the larger below
###717 forces rainwater to percolate down slowly no cracks
###721 and disperse evenly through the terrace slowing regulating the flow of water and
###726 preventing the erosion of topsoil
###730 at the bottom of this uh... on the inside if it out of school
###733 the water is charming sideways towards one of the larger canals to drain the
###738 site so that it flows harmlessly into the valley
###744 the sophistication of the terraces is just a hint of brilliantly adapted
###748 income weather
###752 that ingenuity was vital when it came to sourcing materials to build logic which
###757 is sacred city
###759 he's an ambitious plan required tons of stuff
###763 bringing materials up the mountain without wheeled vehicles couple forces
###767 would have been almost impossible
###769 fortunately patrick reduced emissions had a solution
###780 giant granite voters was strewn all across the ridge
###785 because just a little blocked that much on the side
###788 weighs about a hundred and seventy five pounds which is to say you know i can
###791 pick it up
###792 you know and and that would be one of the smaller stones in the project almost
###796 all the stones in those buildings or at least update were bigger
###800 somehow one institution constructs weighing up to twenty times from the
###804 quality to the site
###807 the logistics of creating architecture
###810 or enormous
###813 for professor susan miles
###815 incas greatest challenge was the lack of sophisticated equipment
###820 this is not a culture with wheels with kraft animals with
###823 the kinds of
###825 uh... machines that we take for granted this is using human labor to move things
###830 destroying end in the seventeenth century illustrates how the income might
###834 have pulled it off
###838 incur we taunton animal fibers into ficus trends
###843 amid twisted the strands in to great lengths of strong rope
###847 using these groups
###849 such approaches work crews would have been able to drive cubes turns into
###853 place
###857 but even the level of service would present a problem
###860 this matter
###862 the fiction created beneath the rockies imu
###865 and the leading edge of raw constantly scoops up there
###869 creating even more resistance
###871 such a good easter masons have to find ways of overcoming this
###875 first to lighten the load
###877 they rough shape the granite inquiry
###879 chipping off the excess with hammerstein's
###887 but much of the choose quantity you can still see waste in mason's left them all
###893 you can see the all around the this this section of the rock they've been cutting
###897 santana stands
###899 cutting this service end of the block would eventually so lost and then they
###903 would start to
###904 work it into a shape that they could use the building
###910 once they had a march to mostly shaped
###912 employed yet another shrewd trick to help them moved
###916 but very clever they would take that
###918 bottom of the stone smooth off they would chip off all the edges all the way
###922 around so that that ended up slightly convex like the bottom of the boat or a
###925 barge
###926 and that way
###927 ticketno x_-rated easily without here just to do
###931 limited turner quite easily dash
###936 the workers might also come to the ground with small stones and gravel
###940 which act like war zones
###942 so that's a huge blocks from the law
###945 this huge slab granite at metro feature
###948 abandoned into working
###950 gives us a snapshot work in progress
###956 these techniques work well for smaller stains
###959 but as evidence from you get to the statues of easter island suggests
###963 moving largest earns requires the use of other techniques
###970 most people think lowers were used routinely will big stones ninety-degree
###974 rollers are very hard to use in the field
###977 their possible use going up going downhill the problem is you have to
###980 little friction you can't control the stove
###982 you're fighting the keystone sinet zero round all the time
###987 and in the tight workspace on the mountain ridge this approved
###999 there wasn't enough space to have dozens of men polling groups
###1002 especially when placing stands on the new perfectly
###1006 fees for sticking could prove to find ways to reduce the number of workers
###1010 needed to move lobsters up and down the slopes
###1018 what you really want is what we call sleepers switches
###1022 like roars but they're fixed they can't roll
###1025 and across that you can move a slight quite easily
###1029 vince lee believes he knows how they can come move to stands around the site
###1034 he says they may have used mechanism sleds why this letter on the ground the
###1039 leader of a string this letter in the wonder garages that the wrongs
###1042 stick out
###1043 beyond upright on the side to the latest on the ground
###1046 going to take a second one for on top of the first one
###1049 and you put your stone on top of the second latter now with levers you can
###1053 apply force between you know rigors of the slide the sliding sled is carrying
###1058 the stone and the latter that stuck to the ground by gravity
###1063 rejection status routinely and i think the intersted to in close quarters
###1069 this technique would have allowed the inca tombstones over the city rough
###1073 terrain
###1075 it also means you don't have a fancy road is up to the latter just sleepy
###1079 plead for all you want lower and for all the other news call the countryside
###1083 using clever techniques incur found ways of moving stones across the difficult
###1088 site
###1090 but the job
###1097 recruiting such an enormous workforce might seem a clinton prospect
###1101 here in ca and prayer
###1104 this challenge was to use in the mail
###1106 and it was manage through taxation
###1113 incas subjects could pay off the taxes that go to the empire by providing
###1117 physical labor
###1119 overseas assembled huge work crews
###1122 and these citizen workers
###1124 had passed a budget used to have a slave labor
###1129 you know you can make slaves go to work but you can't make them do a good job
###1132 leads and they can do is look busy all day long
###1135 then that the workers that did this inka stuff took the time to do it right we
###1139 think that's probably because they had some stage in the results they work
###1142 proud of what they were doing as opposed to simply
###1146 being forced to do it by overlords
###1154 despite the care they taken
###1157 inka builders were about to discover that it doesn't take much to undo weeks
###1161 of work
###1164 in this land of heavy rains and unstable slopes
###1167 one tiny mistake
###1169 can bring everything crashing down
###1178 touched on a precarious mountain ridge machu peaches engineers were engaged in
###1183 a constant battle with gravity
###1186 the terraces they had so carefully constructed sculpted the mountainside
###1191 supporting the city
###1192 anchoring it to the landscape
###1199 but today in the lower terraces a disruption can be seen in the pattern
###1204 something not attended schools onto the language
###1208 others disappeared and i think i think blanket
###1213 higher-ups
###1214 so steep slope is no shaken off the soil wants clinton
###1218 this
###1219 was a landslide
###1221 uh... has given away on the natural fault line
###1224 damaging the texas
###1227 believed to be a slow but destructive of any
###1230 it stretches a hundred and forty meters down the hillside
###1235 remain
###1237 project which is what cruise contracted as always assessing the coolest
###1242 implementing the plan and repairing the damage
###1245 there so you shouldn't is familiar to modern-day engineers but five hundred
###1249 years ago
###1250 it was revolution
###1256 but you could use manned carter drainage channels above the disrupted terraces to
###1260 redirect surface water
###1262 and prevent for the damage
###1269 they couldn't afford to take any chances
###1272 if the heavy rains of the region had said to the foundations
###1276 the water-logged substructure may have slid away with catastrophic results
###1284 building by building all by war
###1287 the engineers punctuated the site with training job placement on the spot
###1292 a hundred and thirteen
###1298 in heavy rains these channels diverted water into a large storm sewer
###1304 fit safely emptied into the rain forest gump one thing in that i will see an and
###1309 must be to his approval to standing on the surface
###1313 and as much as it rains anna sometimes there is really hot here that's always
###1316 training and why you never see it
###1320 once the land was cleared in these firm foundations were laid off
###1324 but you could use to make sense to build the homes classes and temples would make
###1328 up the site
###1330 as always they've worked with nature
###1333 sculpting
###1335 so that he had the buildings flute gracefully across the mountain top
###1343 most cultures
###1344 sort of cut the top off we certainly do for example in our culture just cut the
###1348 top off into the building on top of somehow the incas managed to celebrate
###1352 the natural contour of the land and a natural amenities of the land
###1357 and enhance them with their structures rather than uh... or at work contrary to
###1362 them very unusual and beautifully done
###1366 temples for worship
###1368 poses for a living
###1369 bathing areas underground plaza for gatherings in gangs
###1374 only the rock walls remain
###1379 thatched roofs once act on these structures and ship the heavy rains
###1383 but that's not all they had withstand
###1386 in this half hour while you do can get to have very strong winds sometimes in
###1390 the andes and
###1391 at flows over the top of the roof like
###1394 and flying over the top of the wing
###1397 of an aircraft and is listed underneath
###1399 anika does
###1400 left there is straight off
###1402 so the roofs needed to be launched from each of the structure
###1407 think i had strong wrote
###1409 but little else
###1410 as always
###1411 from the solution mister
###1416 if you look at the uh... end of the building here you can see the always
###1419 stand pegs
###1421 and if you follow the line of the table and
###1424 you can see these rang stands
###1426 sat and sunday when this was part of the system for securing the roofing sanden
###1432 reflects aerials
###1440 the roof makes for each of the hundred and seventy structures that make up the
###1444 urban section of my tribute you will build and assembled onsite
###1451 but the truly remarkable craftsmanship using these features
###1455 windows and dogs
###1456 framed out of wrong
###1463 these distinctive trapeze illegal shapes of the roxanne golden window frames take
###1468 us back to the height of income cult room power
###1474 each one was carlton placed by highly skilled stone masons
###1479 the masons joins us turns without using cement removed
###1483 get the seems oxen
###1485 tight fate does martingale architect
###1489 you often hear people say oh you can't get a knife blade in detroit
###1493 he can't do anything in the jury in some of these places that the stone just
###1496 simply changes color a little as it goes across the truth
###1499 it is racquel
###1503 party committees craftsman to achieve such quality without i'm trumbull seems
###1508 impossible
###1509 get the stones the cross check
###1511 fit together precise
###1519 researchers have found a vital clues to the inka technique in these large
###1523 granite chunks left unfinished much a patient
###1528 smooth pock marks in this interesting to take the use of smaller stones called
###1533 hammerstein
###1534 to shape the rock
###1538 interested workers pounded the surface of the granite with these rounded stones
###1542 obtained from britain france
###1544 until
###1545 they had a smooth surface
###1547 company dust
###1548 as the next stone was laid the stone mason used imprints in the dust as a
###1553 guide to areas needing further
###1556 using progressively smaller understands the mason city do closer and closer
###1560 fixed until the facing top and bottom sentences
###1564 perfect now
###1568 this method created a unique feature income architecture
###1573 you'll never find a straight line for a little corner
###1576 in anika
###1577 building unless it's done by accident you'll never find that
###1580 you'll see sights which superficially appear to be sort of square off stones
###1584 but if you started and carefully
###1586 they weren't square alderdice slightly offs where they they
###1590 and this is very very difficult to do it as long as always the change of chintz
###1594 people discovered that the easy way to put two big stones together is to
###1598 flatten off the site
###1599 benefit that you flip charts together will never see that it's a building
###1605 how would you be inka managed to get these irregular shaped stones to match
###1609 up so perfect
###1611 once again the stones themselves provide the clues
###1616 these walls have sexual slightly and pulled the stands apart
###1622 what they've done here
###1624 is they've made a perfect chilling
###1627 between each stunned
###1628 all the way to the fact that hold this is the stone
###1632 and not only that but it's once faces conclave than the others contracts sows
###1637 that totally fitted together as very
###1640 difficult way to accomplish
###1642 the same perfect fit confirmed all over the site
###1645 both in smaller stones and in the larger ones
###1652 they appear to have been created by the same method if
###1655 removing and repeating regardless of sons
###1660 so the question is
###1661 out of the chief that fit
###1663 vince lee thinks he may have to be honest
###1666 it's called scraping
###1668 a technique sometimes used by you don't cut in campus defective regular milk
###1672 surfaces together
###1674 as much a teacher
###1675 the stone masons transferred the shape of once turned to richmond
###1679 using a protracted to mirror the edge of one surface them up to and shipped it to
###1684 fix the opposite step
###1686 well it's not important to either surface is flat
###1689 all we know is that they will be perfect
###1691 matches for each other and then we can one-time slide the stones together
###1695 they'll have to fit
###1698 to build a senator row upon wrote

###1706 budget committees masons also carefully automated systems tracing them
###1710 vertically and horizontally to spread the loot evenly throughout the temple
###1716 on top of the building the perfect alignment of the finally fiji huge bloc
###1721 seems to be playing craft
###1727 these all stony projections
###1730 provide the clues to its construction
###1732 to access the top and bottom portions of the rocks they used a system of

###1754 this created

###1763 that record crop in the store up in the air which before
###1766 spooked by with some good reason
###1768 but uh... but i've done it and it works
###1773 the careful efforts apache produced in mason's uh... evident all over the

###1827 it aligns perfectly with the window
###1830 but somehow
###1842 i have a randstad
###1843 actually i and i still on the first photographs that was a mistake
###1847 on the twenty first of june nineteen eighty
###1849 four peter frost got up before door and waited for the sun to rise you think of
###1854 fast that nothing's gonna happen next the sun's coming up
###1857 and there's no question like no sunday at seven twenty realizes this
###1861 patch of lights suddenly
###1863 comes alive you know and then is tacitly divided by that kind of stones
###1869 for peter frost this is evidence that the temple was used as a symbol of
###1873 observatory
###1875 there's really a m
###1877 vindicates a lot of people's ideas actually about being concerned about
###1880 what was being done here
###1883 this is the temple of the sermon
###1886 and it has been dark undersigned
###1889 what lies beneath contains puzzling clues that continue tourist info
###1907 beneath the temple of the sunlight is this mysterious substructure
###1912 the entire building with integrated almost seamlessly into a colossal

###1924 of very fine example of the harmonious architecture than the incas digitas
###1929 over instead of c l_ slacking off a piece of land and plunking down a
###1932 building on it they've built around the landscape they they made the landscape
###1936 parts of the architecture
###1939 but that's not where it ends within it that is a flat future
###1943 some say this is a small train departure mama

###1949 you can see that they've
###1950 actually busted a huge block of stones of as this front page of it

###1961 they expanded it
###1962 and adorned it with hand-carved nishu

###1968 and carved out an extraordinary hourglass shaped inlay
###1973 they made the joints square
###1974 rather than london in the classic entrance to her
###1978 but walked was it's purpose
###1981 peter frost thinks he knows the answer
###1984 in the general aspect of this is his uh...
###1988 some kind of
###1989 buried important ceremonial place
###1993 as it's been speculated a royal mausoleum when a cat monies

###2103 sliding down roots to form the site of much of peaches
###2110 one of the false fronts is a giant slope a fractured granite
###2114 offerings shrouded in cologne
###2116 the resulting rain water streams down the granite wall and collects forming a
###2121 natural spring that was discovered by patrick routines engineers
###2128 to capture the water the income constructed an enormous war more than
###2131 fourteen in the hostages law
###2135 picketed the stone houston
###2136 so that water would collect behind the wall and see-through under control
###2141 into a large basin
###2143 even today interest-free
###2151 with the site seven hundred and forty nine meters from the reservoir
###2154 project which is engineers filter water canals with cuts and sudden precisely
###2159 designed at the water flowed at a perfect rate
###2163 with minimum c
###2166 whatever they did they did as efficiently as possible
###2169 these were not wasteful people these are not people through a time or energy or
###2173 resources they did everything as quickly and as
###2177 well as they could
###2179 elevated on its own carries the canal carried up to a hundred and fifty liters
###2183 of water per minute
###2185 bypassing the agricultural fields install houses
###2189 its first destination
###2191 clearly by design
###2192 was the private function of inka emperor punch scooty
###2199 he would have had like a spouse coming uh... bases the splashed uh... facing
###2205 down below
###2206 and no doubt is less people to support services trades and also this is a
###2211 debating may have been ceremonial maybe rachel type of a million years well
###2216 every care was taken with the design
###2218 parent company she is lined the walls there was even a train
###2223 which is this
###2224 water channel cut into sully bedrock deep
###2228 with uh... a little bridge that they've left here with a water flows out
###2235 the empress private box was just one of sixteen unique hand carved pumpkins
###2248 from united made its way throughout the city
###2252 no detail was overlooked
###2254 pick up the functions of so that the waters spilled away from the budget
###2258 water filled the distinctive in cold water jugs
###2262 called by the files
###2264 for the inka wateman was secret
###2272 by mustering water logic which he demonstrated his godlike powers to
###2277 control
###2278 forces of the world
###2280 and his ambition didn't spend that
###2282 of the highest point of the site was the focal point
###2285 patcha kuti secret axis
###2288 he controlled the f
###2290 he controls the stone
###2291 and he controlled water
###2294 budget committee
###2295 wanted to harness the sunday
###2307 tolerating high above mitchell p chu is one of its most talked about features
###2312 but you could use mason scarface abstract shape from a single piece of
###2317 background
###2320 i think it looks
###2321 absolutely martin absolutely contemporary
###2325 fitness out that they would like to do it
###2326 fatalistic in the museum of modern art new york and it would look absolutely a
###2330 home
###2332 while experts concede the system what purpose this remarkable sculptures serve
###2337 it's perfect alignment with the surrounding geography provides hints to
###2341 its function
###2343 he'd lies on the north-south line the can be drawn between monk who end up
###2347 kitchen
###2347 amounts of contain
###2349 the highest peak in the region
###2352 this north-south line can be by sick to my auntie's waistline
###2356 drawn from the sculpture itself
###2358 two months and make it
###2365 pricier on the soda equinox is the son sits precisely about this culture
###2370 and costs no shadow
###2375 and amazingly the pilla itself seems to be column to represent at least tour of
###2380 the surrounding peaks
###2383 all of this points tantalizingly towards one of the incas most deeply-held
###2387 beliefs
###2391 inka may have symbolically tied to send to this place to prevented from
###2395 travelling too far away during the solstice s
###2401 this is the into what time
###2404 host of the sun
###2412 despite more than five hundred years of torrential rains earthquakes and
###2417 landslides danielle perfection of much of the future defies logic
###2422 but there are places where the inka engineers worked is not quite so perfect
###2429 not far away from the hitching post of the sun
###2432 east wall of the principal tempo sinking into the ground
###2437 what went wrong here
###2439 bill on bedrock that wouldn't happen errors on bedrock by then
###2443 survey on the subsoil is being washed away and it's
###2447 gradually sinking
###2450 and that any excavation revealed that the foundations for this great temple
###2453 appear to be determine
###2456 leading scholars mystified
###2458 i don't think we can quite be sure
###2460 when the failure took place but
###2462 come but it's not typical of ink construction so there was some other
###2466 factor it works and it is entirely possible that they were under some
###2469 pressure to complete that part of the project
###2472 and they just decided to cut corner in that case
###2476 if the trouble account during construction
###2479 why did they not attempt to repair the damage
###2481 as they've done in the taxes
###2484 some speculate that the temple collapsed because when they think a face that
###2488 greatest threat
###2492 did four years after budget committee created his empire
###2495 an explorer set off to find that you were
###2502 in fourteen ninety-two
###2504 christopher columbus sailed from the small spanish port of palestinian from
###2509 canada
###2510 out into the atlantic he arrived india medicare's and opened the door to the
###2515 spanish
###2517 and back home he stumbles
###2521 so it was that less than a hundred years after project which you found it much
###2524 impeachment
###2525 the spanish conquistadors shocked at the empire
###2528 mounted or forces and armed with weapons are known to be in ca
###2533 towns
###2541 but less and more catastrophic for the entire than any army fate brought a new
###2545 disease
###2547 smallpox
###2549 millions diet
###2551 inka empire crumbled
###2554 this once bustling center was up and
###2557 with some of the work are finished
###2559 stand still waiting for hands to push them into position
###2570 today at the rear of the ill-fated principal temple huge stones can be seen
###2575 clearly intended for the finer finish
###2579 you can say have a jut out way beyond the playing of the wall itself
###2583 so undoubtedly this was unfinished business
###2587 and people say uh-oh
###2589 so much of the jaws of finished and and i admire sponsor that is is new york
###2593 city finished
###2595 no it's not because it's a living city
###2597 that constantly things being bill constantly things being demolished there
###2601 was changing this changing that that's the way it was a much bt tourism is a
###2605 living
###2606 uh... environment for people who are here
###2610 with the collapse of the entire supply lines
###2614 dinka abandoned
###2615 could lead to picture
###2616 and the city disappears for four hundred years
###2625 until american archaeologist hiram bingham
###2629 pushed his way through the undergrads and was confronted by a magnificent
###2633 stole
###2635 who holds muscle control
###2637 but you could do secret city in the sky
###2642 mar
###2657 conceived to impress the goats into astounded me a mortals
###2662 this great stone city remains unique achievement
###2681 they didn't have much technology but they were every bit as smart as we are
###2684 they just had fewer things to think about they had fewer tools to work with
###2688 your materials to consider
###2690 and they probably knew more about stilled and we will ever cream of
###2693 knowing
###2696 one of the world's greatest engineering achievement much impeaching remains a
###2700 spot djibouti impatient
###2703 tinkers with slightly crazy
###2705 brilliantly crazy they did the extraordinary things things that
###2709 nobody else would have thought of doing
###2713 building
###2713 this extraordinary city here
###2715 on top of the nineteen ridge
###2718 it's an enduring monument to the really and spend ingenuity
###2722 of the income we don't think that we know help ought to cut is workers
###2726 conquered all of these difficulties
###2728 we know that they did because not to keep to is the evidence
###2737 completed or not the site is one of the most amazing structures in the world
###2742 channels feeding the city with an abundant and constant supply of water
###2747 a massive earthquake-proof substructure supporting terraces stonewall quays
###2753 plazas homes and temples a testament to incur engineering
###2758 and the ability to build mega structures in the most challenging locations
###2775 time to an emperor determined to prove his place among the costs
###2792 live
###2796 uh...
