0:0:49,26 --> 0:0:53,85
Yes, I have a bad reputation
for eating roadkill.

ARTHUR BOYT: Here we are at the
gateway to our property.


8
0:1:12,31 --> 0:1:15,98
It is Butterwell farm.


9
0:1:15,98 --> 0:1:19,74
We had a badger come
across here.


10
0:1:19,74 --> 0:1:21,37
Ran across here,
and over there.


11
0:1:21,37 --> 0:1:22,92
Every night he was
coming down.


12
0:1:22,92 --> 0:1:26,8
And one night, coming up, I
very nearly ran him over.


13
0:1:26,8 --> 0:1:28,48
Just caught sight of him about
to go under the wheel.


14
0:1:28,48 --> 0:1:32,22



15
0:1:32,22 --> 0:1:33,78
Yes.


16
0:1:33,78 --> 0:1:42,13
Yes, I've hit at least one
pheasant and one rabbit.


17
0:1:42,13 --> 0:1:46,4
But I would do my utmost to
avoid killing anything.


18
0:1:46,4 --> 0:1:50,21



19
0:1:50,21 --> 0:1:54,47
This is a polecat ferret.


20
0:1:54,47 --> 0:1:56,99
I found it not a mile
away from here.


21
0:1:56,99 --> 0:1:59,75
And it, as you see, has
been thoroughly


22
0:1:59,75 --> 0:2:1,77
rolled out on the road.


23
0:2:1,77 --> 0:2:3,97
They stink.


24
0:2:3,97 --> 0:2:5,58
The flesh smells.


25
0:2:5,58 --> 0:2:14,51
But you can overcome that by
putting the body into running


26
0:2:14,51 --> 0:2:16,9
water for four days.


27
0:2:16,9 --> 0:2:24,45
And that will remove that musky
tang from the meat.


28
0:2:24,45 --> 0:2:26,4
But yes, you could eat it.


29
0:2:26,4 --> 0:2:30,18
You'd have to be pretty hard up
to want to eat a polecat.

33
0:2:38,254 --> 0:2:41,7
And with a cat.


34
0:2:41,7 --> 0:2:45,4
I'm often asked, how
did this all begin?


35
0:2:45,4 --> 0:2:52,52
After 1976, when I was living
on my own, I didn't have to


36
0:2:52,52 --> 0:2:56,615
bother and with anybody else's
feelings in the matter.


37
0:2:56,615 --> 0:3:2,57
The food was there to be
brought home and eaten.


38
0:3:2,57 --> 0:3:6,27
I would pick up roadkill
in those days to


39
0:3:6,27 --> 0:3:8,8
bring home and mount.


40
0:3:8,8 --> 0:3:10,47
I am a taxidermist.


41
0:3:10,47 --> 0:3:14,551
So I'd skin things,
and then stuff.


42
0:3:14,551 --> 0:3:20,83
And instead of throwing the body
away, I decided to start


43
0:3:20,83 --> 0:3:23,38
eating them.


44
0:3:23,38 --> 0:3:29,23
I think that's how it came
about on a regular basis.


45
0:3:29,23 --> 0:3:30,7
I'm pretty sure I'd
eaten badger


46
0:3:30,7 --> 0:3:34,8
before that, and a swan.

A barn owl that was nearby.

0:3:57,12 --> 0:4:0,21
An antler there, and
an antler there.

This is a lovely bird.


54
0:4:2,26 --> 0:4:4,48
That's a snipe.

0:4:4,48 --> 0:4:5,88
I picked that up in Devon.

0:4:5,88 --> 0:4:8,65
I don't know what
this fellow is.


57
0:4:8,65 --> 0:4:9,99
He's a reptile.

Here's a sparrowhawk that
flew into the window.

In fact, I've got three
sparrowhawks here.

0:4:25,88 --> 0:4:28,0
And a buzzard.

I have occasionally hit an
animal myself, by accident.


65
0:4:33,2 --> 0:4:36,27
But I never aim to
kill an animal.


66
0:4:36,27 --> 0:4:38,89
I do my utmost to avoid it.


67

71
0:5:1,303 --> 0:5:3,7
his willie.


72
0:5:3,7 --> 0:5:10,33
Now the badger has a bone in its
willie called the baculum.


73
0:5:10,33 --> 0:5:12,56
And I've got quite
a few of those.


74
0:5:12,56 --> 0:5:15,41



75
0:5:15,41 --> 0:5:18,5
You can eat the penis, yes.


76
0:5:18,5 --> 0:5:20,79
It's not particularly tasty.


77
0:5:20,79 --> 0:5:27,29
But I'd imagine a bit like in
the Arab world the horse penis


78
0:5:27,29 --> 0:5:29,28
is quite a delicacy.

But I wouldn't say it's anything
to write home about.

This is it the badger's head.


81

essential for good sight.

And then you've got the brain.

four, five different tastes

drew up beside me.

And they made my
wife leave me.


211
0:13:5,448 --> 0:13:6,698
It's unthinkable.


212
0:13:6,698 --> 0:13:10,26



213
0:13:10,26 --> 0:13:12,64
So I got a divorce.


214
0:13:12,64 --> 0:13:17,4
And have since happily
remarried.


215
0:13:17,4 --> 0:13:22,305
But I now do not believe in
the existence of God.


216
0:13:22,305 --> 0:13:32,49



217
0:13:32,49 --> 0:13:37,52
I suppose that eating road
kill is a new adventure.


218
0:13:37,52 --> 0:13:43,7
And when you first go to eat
something that isn't supplied


219
0:13:43,7 --> 0:13:49,71
by the butcher, you've got
to cross a threshold.


220
0:13:49,71 --> 0:13:52,195
You are going into unknown
territory.


221
0:13:52,195 --> 0:13:55,59



222
0:13:55,59 --> 0:14:0,985
All I'm doing here is just
sealing the meat.


223
0:14:0,985 --> 0:14:8,11
And that is well charged
with onion and garlic.


224
0:14:8,11 --> 0:14:13,55
I eat a badger once that someone
else had picked up and


225
0:14:13,55 --> 0:14:14,46
put on one side.


226
0:14:14,46 --> 0:14:16,48
Because they wanted
it's skull.


227
0:14:16,48 --> 0:14:23,41
It was blown up like a horse
on the Western Front.


228
0:14:23,41 --> 0:14:26,38
And it smelled rather
horrible.


229
0:14:26,38 --> 0:14:30,79
When I cut into it, the
flesh was green.


230
0:14:30,79 --> 0:14:33,2
But nevertheless,
I persevered.


231
0:14:33,2 --> 0:14:35,24
And stewed it.


232
0:14:35,24 --> 0:14:41,16
It made the house smell like
the old fashioned mental


233
0:14:41,16 --> 0:14:43,33
hospitals used to.


234
0:14:43,33 --> 0:14:45,19
But boy, it tasted delicious.


235
0:14:45,19 --> 0:14:49,5



236
0:14:49,5 --> 0:14:53,76
Well that's the casserole
in the oven.


237
0:14:53,76 --> 0:14:59,222
And to be well cooked it wants
to be in there for three and a


238
0:14:59,222 --> 0:15:0,33
half hours.


239
0:15:0,33 --> 0:15:3,9
Then we'll see how it goes.


240
0:15:3,9 --> 0:15:18,28



241
0:15:18,28 --> 0:15:22,735
Cannibalism, it's a
tricky question.


242
0:15:22,735 --> 0:15:26,5



243
0:15:26,5 --> 0:15:28,96
I don't think it for me to
make comments about other


244
0:15:28,96 --> 0:15:31,76
people being cannibals.


245
0:15:31,76 --> 0:15:36,8
But if I were in a situation
where there was human flesh


246
0:15:36,8 --> 0:15:43,47
available, and it might sustain
me or others with me,


247
0:15:43,47 --> 0:15:48,33
I would have no compunction
about eating it.


248
0:15:48,33 --> 0:15:50,97



249
0:15:50,97 --> 0:15:53,36
All right?


250
0:15:53,36 --> 0:15:58,22
Allow me to introduce you to
Mister Jonathan King, and his


251
0:15:58,22 --> 0:16:0,97
son, Peter King.


252
0:16:0,97 --> 0:16:5,98
He happens to be the brother
of my good wife.


253
0:16:5,98 --> 0:16:10,31
I knew someone who worked in a
hospital lab who could have


254
0:16:10,31 --> 0:16:12,91
got a human leg for me.


255
0:16:12,91 --> 0:16:18,16
But I decided that fun though
it might be, it would be


256
0:16:18,16 --> 0:16:21,69
irresistible to tell somebody
I'd done it.


257
0:16:21,69 --> 0:16:24,42
And once I told them,
I would be branded


258
0:16:24,42 --> 0:16:26,45
forever as a cannibal.


259
0:16:26,45 --> 0:16:28,74
Who knows what that
might result in.


260
0:16:28,74 --> 0:16:33,792



261
0:16:33,792 --> 0:16:34,14
-Badger.


262
0:16:34,14 --> 0:16:38,106
ARTHUR BOYT: This way,
this way, this way.


263
0:16:38,106 --> 0:16:39,356
Here we are.


264
0:16:39,356 --> 0:16:43,57



265
0:16:43,57 --> 0:16:46,89
The skull, meat slipping
off it.


266
0:16:46,89 --> 0:16:48,71
Look at that, nicely cooked.


267
0:16:48,71 --> 0:16:52,11



268
0:16:52,11 --> 0:16:56,5
Here we have a casserole,
badger's head.


269
0:16:56,5 --> 0:16:57,3
Boyt specialty.


270
0:16:57,3 --> 0:16:59,85



271
0:16:59,85 --> 0:17:1,1
This is very tender.


272
0:17:1,1 --> 0:17:5,23



273
0:17:5,23 --> 0:17:7,2
Mm.


274
0:17:7,2 --> 0:17:11,17
I should be in at the
brains in a moment.


275
0:17:11,17 --> 0:17:14,71
I think the brains have all
bubbled out, actually.


276
0:17:14,71 --> 0:17:17,526
The have a tendency
to do that.


277
0:17:17,526 --> 0:17:20,41
They're not where
they originated.


278
0:17:20,41 --> 0:17:21,3
-How about a tongue?


279
0:17:21,3 --> 0:17:23,4
Can you pull the tongue out?


280
0:17:23,4 --> 0:17:25,65
ARTHUR BOYT: Yeah, I can
pull the tongue out.


281
0:17:25,65 --> 0:17:28,329
Here is the tongue.


282
0:17:28,329 --> 0:17:29,579
Do you see the tongue there?


283
0:17:29,579 --> 0:17:33,36



284
0:17:33,36 --> 0:17:35,8
There's the tongue.


285
0:17:35,8 --> 0:17:36,135
See that?


286
0:17:36,135 --> 0:17:37,525
Lovely, badger tongue.


287
0:17:37,525 --> 0:17:50,846



288
0:17:50,846 --> 0:17:51,342
Mm.


289
0:17:51,342 --> 0:18:15,646
[LATIN TRUMPET MUSIC PLAYING]


290
0:18:15,646 --> 0:18:18,7
ARTHUR BOYT: Peter,
to the badger.


291
0:18:18,7 --> 0:18:18,83
PETER KING: To the badger.


292
0:18:18,83 --> 0:18:19,83
Thank you.


293
0:18:19,83 --> 0:18:25,67
ARTHUR BOYT: A misses badger,
it was, a badger sow.


294
0:18:25,67 --> 0:18:27,7
PETER KING: It's not
bad, actually.
