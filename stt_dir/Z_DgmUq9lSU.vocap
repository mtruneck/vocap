###14 CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: Hi, I`m Carl Azuz. You know, we think Fridays are awesome, but
###17 for the 4229 people aboard the Carnival "Triumph" cruise ship, this Friday probably seems especially
###25 awesome. Because hopefully by now they are all off that ship. On Sunday, the ship lost
###30 power in the Gulf of Mexico after a fire in the engine room. Tugboats eventually came
###34 out to help pull the "Triumph" in the port in Mobile, Alabama, but that has been very,
###39 very slow. And when the passengers finally get off the ship, their nightmare may not
###45 be over. One doctor said, conditions on board after the fire made the ship a floating petri
###51 dish, if that sounds kind of gross, that`s his point. No power means the toilets stop
###56 working. Raw sewage can be a major health risk, and we`ve heard reports about it slushing
###61 across the floors and running down the walls. No power means food starts rotting, spoiled
###67 food can lead to E. coli or Salmonella. There haven`t been any reports of any kind of outbreak
###73 on the ship. But the doctor says, a full- blown infection might not show up for a couple
###78 of weeks. So, would you consider cruising again after going through something like this?
###83 On our Facebook page, Mason said, "Sure. That was just one very unlucky cruise." Joseph
###89 and Unique (ph) both said "No way." Reese (ph) would consider taking another cruise,
###93 but not for a very long time, and Kora`s (ph) opinion, if it happens again, it would definitely
###98 be something to tell your grandkids.
###100 Remember, a week or so ago, when we talked about the asteroid that would fly by the Earth,
###106 today is the day. Scientists are sure it won`t hit anything down here. But what about up
###111 there?
###111 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
###112 CHAD MYERS, AMS METEOROLOGIST: This is 17,000 miles away. Now, if you are watching a dish
###115 or Direct TV, your satellite is 22,000 miles away. So, yes, there are some Earth satellites,
###122 here, around the ring. The Moon is far away. The Moon is ten times farther away than what
###127 this thing is going to fly through our geosynchronous Earth orbit. So, is there a chance of it hitting
###132 something? Yes.
###133 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###135 AZUZ: A chance? Sure. But it`s not too likely. One analyst said, other objects pass through
###140 the same area every day. They don`t cause any problems. This asteroid is a lot bigger
###144 than those, but that also means, it`s easier to keep track of. So, scientists have a better
###149 idea of what it will or more likely will not hit.

###154 LEON PANETTA, U.S. DEFENSE SECRETARY: The work that they do, contribution that they
###159 make does contribute to the success of combat operations, particularly when they remove
###169 the enemy from the field of battle.
###173 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###177 AZUZ: Defense Secretary Panetta was talking about members of the military who are not
###181 on the battlefield themselves. People who operate drones, unmanned aircraft, or who
###187 are involved in the military cyber warfare efforts. Secretary Panetta announced a new
###191 medal to honor those people -- the Distinguished Warfare Medal -- he said it will be awarded
###196 for extraordinary actions that directly impact combat operations, but don`t actually involve
###202 the physical risks of combat.
###205 You probably played with some remote control cars or planes at some point -- Secretary
###209 Panetta says this kind of technology is changing the way wars are fought. As drones get more
###215 attention, they can also cause some controversy.
###217 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
###218 NIC ROBERTSON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Drones are remotely controlled aircraft. They are much
###221 more maneuverable than conventional aircraft, much lighter, much cheaper to manufacturer,
###226 and the person, the pilot manning them can be many thousands of miles away on the ground.
###236 Drones are used in two capacities: to support troops on the ground to make sure that there
###240 are no enemy close to them, to make sure that no IEDs, mines, bombs have been laid in the
###246 road ahead of them, and they are also used in a surveillance capacity to monitor people
###252 who might be targets, and then at the end of that surveillance, then the trigger can
###256 be pulled, and the missile can be fired from that aircraft at that target.
###264 Drones are controversial because they can kill from a great distance without certainty
###268 precisely who the person is on the ground or the possibility of collateral damage that
###274 could be women, children in the vicinity. That`s the concern. Also, the person on the
###279 ground, who is being killed, has no right to defend himself. If the information is faulty,
###285 then this can be judged by some people to be a wrongful death.
###292 Targets can take evasive measures, by staying inside buildings. Drones that assigned to
###297 circle those buildings for days, even weeks at a time, to monitor movements who comes,
###302 who goes. They can recognize whether it`s a man or a woman entering that house. So targets
###307 have been known to not leave their location for fear of giving themselves away. Osama
###312 bin Laden, in his compound in Abbotabad, Pakistan, had tall trees planted, so that it was difficult
###318 for drones take a direct and positive recognition of him.
###324 There is an incredible array of uses for drones now. They can be used in agriculture to look
###331 at crops, they can be used by architects to look at buildings. They can be used by law
###337 enforcement. They can be used by amateurs as well, it`s just to take pretty pictures
###340 from high up. There is really, at the moment, a hugely expanded role for drones in the civilian
###347 area.

###351 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Today`s "Shoutout" goes out to Mrs. Weddington`s, Mrs. Wolzen`s and
###356 Ms. Anderson`s social studies classes at Schoo Middle School in Lincoln, Nebraska. Which
###362 U.S. president`s face is not featured on Mt. Rushmore? Is it George Washington, John Adams,
###369 Thomas Jefferson or Abraham Lincoln? You`ve got three seconds, go!
###379 Mt. Rushmore features the faces of Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln and Teddy Roosevelt. But
###385 not John Adams. That`s your answer and that`s your "Shoutout".
###390 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###392 AZUZ: Maybe you owned government class, maybe you can name all the U.S presidents. But do
###397 you know who is honored by President`s Day? You could have asked Calvin Coolidge, but
###401 he might have been silent on the matter. Teddy Roosevelt might have walked softly around
###406 the subject, despite being a rough writer. Most Americans believe President`s Day is
###410 about every president we`ve had. But that`s kind of wring, at least as far as its origin
###415 goes. President`s Day was originally Washington`s birthday, just Washington`s. On February 22nd.
###421 It became a federal holiday in 1885, and as far as the U.S government`s concerned, it`s
###427 still Washington`s birthday, not President`s Day. In 1968, Congress voted to switch it
###433 to the third Monday in February, giving government employees a three day weekend. But even though
###438 Washington`s birthday and Lincoln`s birthday were only days apart, Congress refused to
###443 combine them n the President`s Day, though that`s what many Americans do. So, if you
###448 work for the government, you`ll get a day off for Washington`s birthday. If you don`t,
###451 you may get a day off for President`s Day. Those, after all, are the precedents.
###456 Well, how do you stand out in the crowd? It`s a question some of you might be wondering,
###461 as you start applying to college. Last weekend, there was a major college fair, right next
###465 door to the CNN Center. I spoke with some college admission officers there about what
###469 they look for in prospective students, and about what they think, you should do, when
###474 you picking out a school.
###475 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
###476 QUENTIN JOHNSON, UNIVERSITY OF TAMPA: Someone who really stands out, someone who`s really
###480 strong with their extracurricular activities as well as someone that has done well academically.
###486 JESSICA GRANT, PRESBYTERIAN COLLEGE: Probably maybe think of the top three things that they
###490 are looking for. I think, major does a big part to consider. But also, what the school
###495 offers and the things that this school focuses on.
###497 CLINTON HOBBS, YOUNG HARRIS COLLEGE: We tend to find the students that are really emerged
###502 in the high school experience, involved in three to four or five extracurricular or co-curricular
###508 activities, actively involved in civic opportunities, maybe involved in their church. Tend to really
###515 impress us more. A more well rounded student, a more holistically developed individual is
###522 going to be better prepared for today`s world, career, work, life.

###529 AZUZ: Jeopardy just wrapped up its annual team tournament. And when it came to final
###533 jeopardy, Leonard Cooper didn`t know the answer, but he also knew it didn`t matter.
###537 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
###538 ALEX TREBEK, HOST, JEOPARDY: Now we go to Leonard Cooper. He is looking pretty happy.
###541 Why? Did he come up with Ike, Dwight David Eisenhower?
###543 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, I didn`t.
###544 TREBEK: You didn`t.
###545 (LAUGHTER)
###546 TREBEK: Same guy, some guy (inaudible), but I just won $75,000.
###552 (APPLAUSE)
###553 AZUZ: It sounds like the host appreciates the smart Alecs, but I guess, you can afford
###558 to have some fun, when your victory isn`t in jeopardy. All right. That`s going to wrap
###562 things up for today. Teachers, we are looking for your feedback on today`s show. Asteroids,
###567 cruise, college -- finally, to share your thought on our home page, there will be no
###571 show on Monday for President`s Day. We hope you enjoy the long weekend, and we`ll forward
###575 to seeing you again on Tuesday. Bye there.
