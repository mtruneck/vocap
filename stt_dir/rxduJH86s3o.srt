2
0:0:5,39 --> 0:0:6,9
CHARLET DUBOC: It was our
last day in Atlanta.


3
0:0:6,9 --> 0:0:9,72
And Billy had set a party in
honor of the camera to


4
0:0:9,72 --> 0:0:12,226
announce the model he'd
be bringing to London.


5
0:0:12,226 --> 0:0:12,68
BILLY BAD ASS: All right.


6
0:0:12,68 --> 0:0:14,29
This is a grand finale tonight,


7
0:0:14,29 --> 0:0:15,943
before we go to London.


8
0:0:15,943 --> 0:0:19,4
I'm going to announce
one of the models.


9
0:0:19,4 --> 0:0:21,84
She's going to be selected
to go to London.


10
0:0:21,84 --> 0:0:25,91
And we're going to
make it happen.


11
0:0:25,91 --> 0:0:28,36
CHARLET DUBOC: En route, he got
a call from Arlene, one of


12
0:0:28,36 --> 0:0:30,28
the models from the casting.


13
0:0:30,28 --> 0:0:32,759
She was already waiting at the
club, but none of the other


14
0:0:32,759 --> 0:0:34,172
girls had showed up.


15
0:0:34,172 --> 0:0:35,9
ARLENE: I'll see you
when you get here.


16
0:0:35,9 --> 0:0:36,39
BILLY BAD ASS: All right.


17
0:0:36,39 --> 0:0:36,875
Bye.


18
0:0:36,875 --> 0:0:38,125
ARLENE: Bye-bye.


19
0:0:38,125 --> 0:0:40,76



20
0:0:40,76 --> 0:0:41,76
WILLIAM FAIRMAN: Who was that?


21
0:0:41,76 --> 0:0:42,535
BILLY BAD ASS: That's
one of the models.


22
0:0:42,535 --> 0:0:42,85
WILLIAM FAIRMAN: Arlene?


23
0:0:42,85 --> 0:0:43,67
BILLY BAD ASS: Yeah.


24
0:0:43,67 --> 0:0:44,59
WILLIAM FAIRMAN: Arlene?


25
0:0:44,59 --> 0:0:45,1
BILLY BAD ASS: Yeah, Arlene.


26
0:0:45,1 --> 0:0:47,34
WILLIAM FAIRMAN: What was she
saying about the other girls?


27
0:0:47,34 --> 0:0:50,54
BILLY BAD ASS: I charge
a registration fee.


28
0:0:50,54 --> 0:0:53,4
They didn't want to pay it.


29
0:0:53,4 --> 0:0:55,32
WILLIAM FAIRMAN: They've
turned up, though?


30
0:0:55,32 --> 0:0:55,765
BILLY BAD ASS: Hmm?


31
0:0:55,765 --> 0:0:56,79
WILLIAM FAIRMAN: They've
turned up to


32
0:0:56,79 --> 0:0:57,75
the place, or not?


33
0:0:57,75 --> 0:0:58,675
The girls?


34
0:0:58,675 --> 0:1:0,412
Are there other girls outside?


35
0:1:0,412 --> 0:1:1,62
BILLY BAD ASS: No.


36
0:1:1,62 --> 0:1:5,73
Arlene is the one that
is ambitious,


37
0:1:5,73 --> 0:1:8,674
that wants to do this.


38
0:1:8,674 --> 0:1:11,51
The other girls--


39
0:1:11,51 --> 0:1:15,32
if $100 is going to hold them
back to go to London, they


40
0:1:15,32 --> 0:1:16,54
don't need to go.


41
0:1:16,54 --> 0:1:20,78
So what I'm going to do is I'm
going to announce that


42
0:1:20,78 --> 0:1:22,33
Arlene's coming.


43
0:1:22,33 --> 0:1:25,42
CHARLET DUBOC: Because she's
the only one that showed.


44
0:1:25,42 --> 0:1:26,25
BILLY BAD ASS: She's
the only one that


45
0:1:26,25 --> 0:1:33,44
showed that was qualified.


46
0:1:33,44 --> 0:1:34,41
CHARLET DUBOC: I was worried.


47
0:1:34,41 --> 0:1:36,55
Billy didn't seem to be
choosing a girl on her


48
0:1:36,55 --> 0:1:39,17
modeling ability, but more
her willingness to


49
0:1:39,17 --> 0:1:42,12
part with her money.


50
0:1:42,12 --> 0:1:46,59
So what can we expect from
the announcement?


51
0:1:46,59 --> 0:1:50,0
BILLY BAD ASS: People clapping
and happy for her.


52
0:1:50,0 --> 0:1:51,33
WILLIAM FAIRMAN: Are
you excited?


53
0:1:51,33 --> 0:1:51,85
BILLY BAD ASS: Yeah.


54
0:1:51,85 --> 0:1:54,72
I'm excited.


55
0:1:54,72 --> 0:1:59,41
I'm always trying to outdo what
I've done in the past.


56
0:1:59,41 --> 0:2:0,54
I'm calm and collected.


57
0:2:0,54 --> 0:2:2,276
I have to stay smooth, though.


58
0:2:2,276 --> 0:2:4,15
CHARLET DUBOC: OK.


59
0:2:4,15 --> 0:2:6,5
Let's do it.


60
0:2:6,5 --> 0:2:10,1
As soon as we arrived at the
museum bar, it was clear no


61
0:2:10,1 --> 0:2:12,72
one here was expecting
Billy Bad Ass and the


62
0:2:12,72 --> 0:2:14,911
Urban Fashion Week.


63
0:2:14,911 --> 0:2:17,99
After negotiating with the
bouncer, we were finally


64
0:2:17,99 --> 0:2:19,53
allowed in.


65
0:2:19,53 --> 0:2:23,1
The stage that Billy had
intended for the announcement


66
0:2:23,1 --> 0:2:26,61
was occupied by a jazz band,
leading a Sunday dinner dance


67
0:2:26,61 --> 0:2:29,97
for a subdued older crowd.


68
0:2:29,97 --> 0:2:33,49
As I followed Billy wandering
aimlessly around the club, a


69
0:2:33,49 --> 0:2:36,99
cold feeling swept over me that
maybe the London Urban


70
0:2:36,99 --> 0:2:39,263
Fashion Week was all just
smoke and mirrors.


71
0:2:39,263 --> 0:2:42,89



72
0:2:42,89 --> 0:2:45,41
We eventually found ourselves
on a balcony,


73
0:2:45,41 --> 0:2:48,375
where we met Arlene.


74
0:2:48,375 --> 0:2:50,84
BILLY BAD ASS: I didn't even
realize those pants you had


75
0:2:50,84 --> 0:2:52,812
on, those shiny,
glittery pants.


76
0:2:52,812 --> 0:2:54,619
CHARLET DUBOC: Well, Billy,
I thought you


77
0:2:54,619 --> 0:2:55,869
were a fashion guy.


78
0:2:55,869 --> 0:2:59,221



79
0:2:59,221 --> 0:3:2,19
So what are we doing up here?


80
0:3:2,19 --> 0:3:6,25
BILLY BAD ASS: Well, we're just
going to announce that


81
0:3:6,25 --> 0:3:9,13
this young lady right here is
going to be going to London.


82
0:3:9,13 --> 0:3:10,57
ARLENE: Shut up!


83
0:3:10,57 --> 0:3:13,47
[SCREECHES]


84
0:3:13,47 --> 0:3:15,625
CHARLET DUBOC: Really?


85
0:3:15,625 --> 0:3:16,475
ARLENE: Wait, wait a second.


86
0:3:16,475 --> 0:3:18,958
Let me take it all in.


87
0:3:18,958 --> 0:3:20,395
I'm taking it all in.


88
0:3:20,395 --> 0:3:21,832
So I'm going to London?


89
0:3:21,832 --> 0:3:23,269
BILLY BAD ASS: Yeah, you're
going to London.


90
0:3:23,269 --> 0:3:25,185
ARLENE: [LAUGHS]


91
0:3:25,185 --> 0:3:27,41
Oh my goodness!


92
0:3:27,41 --> 0:3:30,51
CHARLET DUBOC: $100 for the
privilege of standing on this


93
0:3:30,51 --> 0:3:32,26
cold balcony.


94
0:3:32,26 --> 0:3:34,75
So much for the big
announcement.


95
0:3:34,75 --> 0:3:36,57
Arlene seemed thrilled.


96
0:3:36,57 --> 0:3:38,228
But I was skeptical.


97
0:3:38,228 --> 0:3:38,726
ARLENE: Whew.


98
0:3:38,726 --> 0:3:41,714
I'm just taking it
all in right now.


99
0:3:41,714 --> 0:3:43,208
I was just shocked.


100
0:3:43,208 --> 0:3:44,204
Charlet!


101
0:3:44,204 --> 0:3:44,702
This is crazy!


102
0:3:44,702 --> 0:3:46,196
CHARLET DUBOC: Why
are you shocked?


103
0:3:46,196 --> 0:3:49,85
ARLENE: I've never been
overseas, ever.


104
0:3:49,85 --> 0:3:54,98
And to have an opportunity to go
overseas, plus do something


105
0:3:54,98 --> 0:3:59,12
that I've been trying to
pursue for a long time.


106
0:3:59,12 --> 0:4:0,51
BILLY BAD ASS: What we're going
to do is you're going to


107
0:4:0,51 --> 0:4:1,932
fly over there on Wednesday.


108
0:4:1,932 --> 0:4:3,96
You're going to get
there on Thursday.


109
0:4:3,96 --> 0:4:6,82
We're going to do a fashion
casting party where all the


110
0:4:6,82 --> 0:4:7,81
designers are going to come.


111
0:4:7,81 --> 0:4:9,4
And you're going to go
somewhere. we're going to have


112
0:4:9,4 --> 0:4:9,97
a photoshoot.


113
0:4:9,97 --> 0:4:11,407
We're going to hang
out on Friday.


114
0:4:11,407 --> 0:4:12,844
We don't know where we're going
to hang out on Friday.


115
0:4:12,844 --> 0:4:13,323
ARLENE: OK.


116
0:4:13,323 --> 0:4:13,802
OK.


117
0:4:13,802 --> 0:4:15,239
BILLY BAD ASS: But the camera's
going to be rolling


118
0:4:15,239 --> 0:4:17,155
wherever we're going to be at.


119
0:4:17,155 --> 0:4:19,71
CHARLET DUBOC: So what's
going to happen now,


120
0:4:19,71 --> 0:4:20,29
between now and London?


121
0:4:20,29 --> 0:4:21,31
What are the preparations?


122
0:4:21,31 --> 0:4:21,75
BILLY BAD ASS: We're
going to talk about


123
0:4:21,75 --> 0:4:22,807
that off the camera.


124
0:4:22,807 --> 0:4:23,805
CHARLET DUBOC: Off camera?


125
0:4:23,805 --> 0:4:25,801
Why off camera?


126
0:4:25,801 --> 0:4:29,294
BILLY BAD ASS: I mean, you know,
we'll talk about it.


127
0:4:29,294 --> 0:4:29,793
CHARLET DUBOC: OK.


128
0:4:29,793 --> 0:4:30,292
BILLY BAD ASS: Yeah.


129
0:4:30,292 --> 0:4:31,542
CHARLET DUBOC: OK.


130
0:4:31,542 --> 0:4:33,35



131
0:4:33,35 --> 0:4:36,91
We waited outside the club for
Billy to have his off-camera


132
0:4:36,91 --> 0:4:39,69
chat with Arlene.


133
0:4:39,69 --> 0:4:40,825
Suddenly Arlene left.


134
0:4:40,825 --> 0:4:44,62
And we got a silent ride back
with Billy, slightly unsure


135
0:4:44,62 --> 0:4:48,575
about what had taken
place between them.


136
0:4:48,575 --> 0:4:50,43
It was our last night
in Atlanta.


137
0:4:50,43 --> 0:4:53,9
And by this point, I had no idea
what was going on, let


138
0:4:53,9 --> 0:4:56,682
alone whether the London Urban
Fashion Week was going ahead.


139
0:4:56,682 --> 0:5:4,57



140
0:5:4,57 --> 0:5:7,25
The following morning,
Arlene called us.


141
0:5:7,25 --> 0:5:9,82
She wanted to talk about last
night, and invited us over to


142
0:5:9,82 --> 0:5:14,9
a photo studio across town on
our way to the airport.


143
0:5:14,9 --> 0:5:17,87
ARLENE: He said, Arlene, I need
to speak with you inside,


144
0:5:17,87 --> 0:5:18,81
away from the camera.


145
0:5:18,81 --> 0:5:20,82
So I said, OK.


146
0:5:20,82 --> 0:5:23,27
He said, so now you've won.


147
0:5:23,27 --> 0:5:26,56
I have to let you know that
you're going to need to come


148
0:5:26,56 --> 0:5:29,486
up with another $600.


149
0:5:29,486 --> 0:5:33,27
He said, I'm sure you can come
up with it some kind of way.


150
0:5:33,27 --> 0:5:34,92
I'm sure there's family
members that


151
0:5:34,92 --> 0:5:37,2
could help you out.


152
0:5:37,2 --> 0:5:39,2
There was no documents.


153
0:5:39,2 --> 0:5:43,14
I did not sign up
for anything.


154
0:5:43,14 --> 0:5:46,34
Everything was just happening
so suddenly.


155
0:5:46,34 --> 0:5:51,1
Anyhow, nonetheless, I don't
think that I should pay.


156
0:5:51,1 --> 0:5:51,87
CHARLET DUBOC: Yeah.


157
0:5:51,87 --> 0:5:54,12
ARLENE: And that's what Tyra
Banks said on her show.


158
0:5:54,12 --> 0:5:57,27
CHARLET DUBOC: So do you realize
now-- does it feel


159
0:5:57,27 --> 0:5:58,77
like you were exploited?


160
0:5:58,77 --> 0:5:59,1
ARLENE: Yeah.


161
0:5:59,1 --> 0:6:2,46
I feel like it wasn't
authentic.


162
0:6:2,46 --> 0:6:4,58
But a part of me wasn't
surprised.


163
0:6:4,58 --> 0:6:6,92
Because here in Atlanta, there's
so many people who's


164
0:6:6,92 --> 0:6:10,41
always trying to take advantage
of people here in


165
0:6:10,41 --> 0:6:14,41
the model world, the music
industry, acting.


166
0:6:14,41 --> 0:6:16,7
CHARLET DUBOC: Are you relieved
or disappointed?


167
0:6:16,7 --> 0:6:18,5
ARLENE: A combination of both.


168
0:6:18,5 --> 0:6:19,89
A combination of both.


169
0:6:19,89 --> 0:6:23,79
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't
disappointed, because I


170
0:6:23,79 --> 0:6:28,74
saw it as an opportunity to
further a potential career in


171
0:6:28,74 --> 0:6:31,26
the model industry.


172
0:6:31,26 --> 0:6:33,27
CHARLET DUBOC: It was clear
now that Billy had a very


173
0:6:33,27 --> 0:6:35,21
unorthodox way of working.


174
0:6:35,21 --> 0:6:37,783
And if teasing money out of
young girls with a desire to


175
0:6:37,783 --> 0:6:40,81
break into the fashion industry
was it, we weren't


176
0:6:40,81 --> 0:6:44,7
going to have anything further
to do with it.


177
0:6:44,7 --> 0:6:44,81
OK.


178
0:6:44,81 --> 0:6:47,501
So we're on our way
to the airport.


179
0:6:47,501 --> 0:6:49,9
And I've still got one last
thing to do before I leave


180
0:6:49,9 --> 0:6:53,8
Atlanta, which is call Billy and
break the news that we're


181
0:6:53,8 --> 0:6:56,29
no longer going to be covering
his event in London.


182
0:6:56,29 --> 0:6:57,54
So here we go.

185
0:7:18,77 --> 0:7:22,85
CHARLET DUBOC: Billy never
answered the phone.


186
0:7:22,85 --> 0:7:25,305
I felt so disappointed in him
for taking these young


187
0:7:25,305 --> 0:7:28,64
people's good nature for
granted, but also couldn't


188
0:7:28,64 --> 0:7:30,78
help but pity him.


189
0:7:30,78 --> 0:7:32,97
Could it be that as well as
being the villain in this


190
0:7:32,97 --> 0:7:37,55
story, he is, in fact, his own
worst enemy, the victim of his


191
0:7:37,55 --> 0:7:39,51
own environment and aspirational
culture, where


192
0:7:39,51 --> 0:7:42,58
people will do anything
to get ahead?


193
0:7:42,58 --> 0:7:45,62
It turns out Arlene isn't the
only girl who's been affected


194
0:7:45,62 --> 0:7:48,1
by Billy's opportunistic
work practice.


195
0:7:48,1 --> 0:7:51,3
There's a whole load of
disapproval online from other


196
0:7:51,3 --> 0:7:54,5
disgruntled fashion people
who've had the misfortune of


197
0:7:54,5 --> 0:7:58,201

forcing the models to

0:8:13,19 --> 0:8:15,49
sell tickets, or better yet,
we're telling the models in


204
0:8:15,49 --> 0:8:17,98
the fashion show that if you
sell enough tickets, you'll


205
0:8:17,98 --> 0:8:19,0
get a flight to Paris.


206
0:8:19,0 --> 0:8:21,52
Does that even sound right?


207
0:8:21,52 --> 0:8:22,77
DISGRUNTLED VLOGGER 2:
God don't like ugly.


208
0:8:22,77 --> 0:8:24,33
And karma's a bitch.


209
0:8:24,33 --> 0:8:29,99
And when you fuck with people,
you get it back times 10.


210
0:8:29,99 --> 0:8:31,0
DISGRUNTLED VLOGGER 3: I'm not
even going to say it's your


211
0:8:31,0 --> 0:8:33,32
first time, because you
know what, sweetie?


212
0:8:33,32 --> 0:8:35,13
It wasn't your first time.


213
0:8:35,13 --> 0:8:37,52
So that means that
I have to go in.


214
0:8:37,52 --> 0:8:41,24
I have to go in you with
no lube and raw.


215
0:8:41,24 --> 0:8:43,32
DISGRUNTLED VLOGGER 2: It's such
a wonderful thing to know


216
0:8:43,32 --> 0:8:47,17
that he's being banned from
a list of cities.


217
0:8:47,17 --> 0:8:48,77
He cannot show.


218
0:8:48,77 --> 0:10:48,77
