0:0:4,41 --> 0:0:9,15
Word Up Food Tubers, Mr Oliver here.
Ok, it's a very, very important day in the


2
0:0:9,15 --> 0:0:14,99
annual calendar. Yes, we're very close to
Valentine's Day and I've had a little shout


3
0:0:14,99 --> 0:0:18,5
out from a fellow You Tuber, Jim Chapman,
over there.


4
0:0:18,5 --> 0:0:25,3
Hello, how are you?!


5
0:0:25,3 --> 0:0:28,369
I'm engaged to a beautiful lady, Tanya, she's


6
0:0:28,369 --> 0:0:33,92
also on You Tube. She does makeup tutorials
and also sort of fun, cute videos. And she's


7
0:0:33,92 --> 0:0:37,46
just delightful to behold.
This will be our eighth valentine's day and


8
0:0:37,46 --> 0:0:42,0
I need something to impress her that might
get me lucky later.


9
0:0:42,0 --> 0:0:46,379
Ok, so we've got a beautiful meal.
We're gonna do marinated, seared tuna with


10
0:0:46,379 --> 0:0:52,12
a nice spaghetti with a simple tomato sauce.
Perfect for Valentine's Day. Let's do it!


11
0:0:52,12 --> 0:0:55,77
So grab your pestle and mortar. I want a nice
pinch of salt Jim.
Ok


12
0:0:55,77 --> 0:0:57,98
That's for seasoning and to give a nice bit


13
0:0:57,98 --> 0:1:0,899
of abrasion.
Like it, good word.


14
0:1:0,899 --> 0:1:2,35
What is it?!
Abrasion.


15
0:1:2,35 --> 0:1:9,679
Yes, very nice. We're gonna grab a wad of
basil and we're gonna make a basil oil.


16
0:1:9,679 --> 0:1:12,959
I think actually when she sees me doing this
anyway I won't even need to cook anymore.


17
0:1:12,959 --> 0:1:15,69
She'll just come in and go - Wow!
That's my boy!


18
0:1:15,69 --> 0:1:19,369
Job done!
So, olive oil. A couple of good tablespoons.


19
0:1:19,369 --> 0:1:26,33
So half the zest of a lemon goes in, just
about 3 or 4 strokes. Just the juice of half


20
0:1:26,33 --> 0:1:31,789
a lemon is probably more than enough.
I only want you to put half on this tuna.


21
0:1:31,789 --> 0:1:36,209
And then I'd keep this for sort of drizzling
on the end because it's fresh and alive!


22
0:1:36,209 --> 0:1:42,2
Sustainable fish! We do not want to be using
Bigeye or Bluefin tuna. So Yellowfin or Skipjacks


23
0:1:42,2 --> 0:1:46,899
are really, really good to use. We are gonna
do something very special. Jim, I want you


24
0:1:46,899 --> 0:1:49,69
hold that pack and smash it like a man on
that board.


25
0:1:49,69 --> 0:1:51,77
This is where it's all gonna go wrong isn't
it?!


26
0:1:51,77 --> 0:1:54,6
Dominant!
Yeah! That's what I'm talking about!


27
0:1:54,6 --> 0:1:56,1
Yeeeeah!


28
0:1:56,1 --> 0:1:57,7
Wooooah!


29
0:1:57,7 --> 0:2:3,119
Next, 200g of tomatoes. We're just gonna cut
them into half.


30
0:2:3,119 --> 0:2:6,8
Once upon a time, I cooked


31
0:2:6,8 --> 0:2:13,8
naked for my wife. I was like you. I was young,
vulnerable and looking for love. And not married


32
0:2:13,8 --> 0:2:19,2
yet. And I actually cooked whole sea bass
in my new oven. As I opened the door to check


33
0:2:19,2 --> 0:2:26,9
my sea bass, a jet of hot steam shot into
my penis, my whole night was ruined! So that's


34
0:2:26,9 --> 0:2:28,3
a warning!
Or wear clothes when you cook!


35
0:2:28,3 --> 0:2:30,19
Or just wear pinny.
Yeah.


36
0:2:30,19 --> 0:2:33,81
So we've halved our tomatoes, good job. We
want some garlic, just a couple of cloves


37
0:2:33,81 --> 0:2:36,31
of garlic each.
Tell us all about your channel.


38
0:2:36,31 --> 0:2:40,5
So essentially what I do every week, on a
Friday, I'll upload a video where I embarrass


39
0:2:40,5 --> 0:2:44,86
myself in some way.
So people basically tune in to see you squirming


40
0:2:44,86 --> 0:2:49,43
at your own sort of self...
Yeah, self-loathing, self-pity, that sort


41
0:2:49,43 --> 0:2:51,13
of stuff.
Ok, it's time to cook the Tuna.


42
0:2:51,13 --> 0:2:53,45
A lot of people think that Tuna has to be
cooked all the way through.


43
0:2:53,45 --> 0:2:58,35
No I don't like it like that, bit tough.
A little bit pink is good.


44
0:2:58,35 --> 0:3:2,819
Let's make a two minute tomato sauce. I wanna
go in with a whole pinch of fennel seeds.


45
0:3:2,819 --> 0:3:8,26
Go in with some olive oil, garlic, grab a chilli.
So I reckon about half a chilli is going to


46
0:3:8,26 --> 0:3:12,43
be good for you and your Mrs. And then go
in with your tomatoes as well. Now if we look


47
0:3:12,43 --> 0:3:16,13
in the pan now, see I'm just gonna turn this
Tuna over.


48
0:3:16,13 --> 0:3:18,88
Oh yeah!
Beautiful!


49
0:3:18,88 --> 0:3:23,4
So tuna on, sauce on, pasta's on with a nice
pinch of salt, nice pinch of pepper.


50
0:3:23,4 --> 0:3:28,76
If you look in this pan, see how we're just
softening up those cherry tomatoes.


51
0:3:28,76 --> 0:3:34,42
We've had about a minute and a half on each
of these Tuna so here's your one. And like


52
0:3:34,42 --> 0:3:38,709
a piece of meat, we're gonna let that rest.
Now Jim, if you can get a little bit of that


53
0:3:38,709 --> 0:3:46,74
lovely, fresh basil oil. Divide up our pasta.
Just grab some basil and just tear a little


54
0:3:46,74 --> 0:3:49,88
bit, or chop a little bit through. You don't
need much.


55
0:3:49,88 --> 0:3:54,99
Right at the last minute.
So we're gonna just drag that onto a plate.


56
0:3:54,99 --> 0:3:57,47
But I think it's quite nice to have this as
a share plate.


57
0:3:57,47 --> 0:4:1,27
Yeah, then there's more chance of you getting
that sort of Lady and the Tramp moment isn't there.


58
0:4:1,27 --> 0:4:3,53
Yes! and are you gonna make this for her on
Valentine's Day.


59
0:4:3,53 --> 0:4:7,13
Yeah! Yeah, that's the reason I'm here.
Ok, so over here we're just gonna tear that


60
0:4:7,13 --> 0:4:10,23
open and you see how that's blushing in the
middle?! That's what we want.


61
0:4:10,23 --> 0:4:13,709
And we can just tear that up and it gives
you more surface area to have that lovely


62
0:4:13,709 --> 0:4:16,16
marinade.
So Jim look, you've done a great job mate.


63
0:4:16,16 --> 0:4:17,789
I'm very proud of myself.
You're good!


64
0:4:17,789 --> 0:4:19,539
I've entered manhood.
So how are we gonna test this?


65
0:4:19,539 --> 0:4:28,5
I dunno, you know?!
Hmmmm...


66
0:4:28,5 --> 0:4:31,0
You are the best! No, you are the best! I've


67
0:4:31,0 --> 0:4:33,919
made this meal for you because I love you.
Because I love you.


68
0:4:33,919 --> 0:4:37,0
And you are gonna get to try every single
bit of it!


69
0:4:37,0 --> 0:4:40,1
Ha ha ha
Why do you look nervous?


70
0:4:40,1 --> 0:4:42,47
I'm petrified!
We're just doing role play here alright?!


71
0:4:42,47 --> 0:4:49,0
I'm scared! Behind your eyes it looks like
you're curious!


72
0:4:49,0 --> 0:4:57,3
Up you go, with confidence.
Up, across, nailed it!


73
0:4:57,3 --> 0:4:59,15
Mmm, wow!
Pasta's very good Jim.


74
0:4:59,15 --> 0:5:2,37
I'm impressed with myself.
A really nice plate of food, well-cooked my


75
0:5:2,37 --> 0:5:3,85
