###20 FREDDY CORBIN: I tell them the story, you know, well, I did
###23 my brother's funeral here, and I got married, and I'm having
###25 a baby, so I'm kind of coming back for good juju for his
###29 birth and stuff like that.
###31 And they just got it.
###33 They're way into thinking like that.
###34 You know what I mean?
###35 So they just totally got it.
###37 We were trying to figure out a place to tattoo.
###40 They told them what I was doing, and asked them if it
###42 was OK if I tattooed at the temple.
###44 They really dug the intention of what we were doing.
###47 They were just dumbfounded, why would you come here and
###50 tattoo us for free?
###51 Now, the temple would literally only fit a few
###54 people in there.
###55 But we would do a puja every morning, build an altar donate
###60 fruit to the sadhus, the Brahmin
###63 priests that are monastic.
###67 My friend, Vinnie, that I was telling you about, made a big
###69 flower mandala.
###70 We decorated the whole temple with flowers and
###72 marigolds and stuff.
###73 It was really beautiful.
###75 It was really magical.
###76 So I just drew up this piece of flash, any of these seven
###79 designs for free.
###82 I wrote it out in Hindi that there was no charge.
###86 It was only symbols.
###87 It was religious symbols.
###88 So there was a Tibetan om, a Hindu om, a Buddhist om, a
###92 cross, and a swastika with a--
###95 The swastikas over there usually has four dots in them,
###98 one for each element.
###100 And it's funny because I did tons of crosses, and I didn't
###104 do one swastika, which I thought was kind of unusual.
###109 But they were like, since World War II, we don't really
###112 push the swastika so much.
###114 It's all over our religious artwork.
###116 It's all over our buildings and our clothes, but, at the
###119 same time, they get that it kind of hurts people's
###122 feelings, in a way, which I thought was pretty cool.
###125 There was probably 50 guys hanging out, and everybody's
###129 like, oh, me, me, me, me, me first, me first.
###131 So we were basically trying to figure out how are
###134 we going to do this?
###136 And are we going to give them tickets?
###138 So my friend, Little Mary, was really good.
###141 She had a great idea.
###142 She's like, just take a Sharpie and just draw a number
###146 on them and sign it.
###147 So I would basically just write number one,
###150 cross, and sign it.
###153 Number two, om, sign it.
###156 Dustin, my apprentice, was just on point.
###158 He was right there next to me, handing me a clean set up as
###161 soon as I--
###163 I'd take a smoke break every four or five or whatever, but
###165 we worked pretty labor intensively because we were
###169 tattooing under the light of day.
###171 MALE SPEAKER: Were you the only guy tattooing?
###172 FREDDY CORBIN: Yeah.
###174 Going into the night, I had a head lamp on.
###178 So we only had a little bit after dark to do it before
###181 they had to do the closing ceremony and lock
###183 the doors and stuff.
###185 Then we'd go in back and smoke hash with
###186 the priests and stuff.
###187 It was really awesome.
###189 A really sweet thing when I was there the first time, I
###192 met this two really cool kids.
###195 It was Raj and Raju, they're brothers.
###197 So Raj wanted to be the first one.
###200 He's like, Freddy, can I be the first one?
###202 Of course, of course.
###204 And just perfect for India because no rules apply.
###207 I had the seven that you could only get, but at the bottom,
###210 there was a little pyramid with an eye,
###211 and he wanted that.
###212 So the first thing I did was break the rules of only
###216 getting the seven and then everybody was like,
###218 well, can I get it?
###219 And I was like, no, no, no, only Raj.
###220 Only Raj.
###221 Only Raj.
###222 So I tattooed a cross on his younger brother's neck and it
###228 looked pretty cool.
###229 I mean, it was on his neck, he's like 16 years old now.
###233 And my cut off point was 15 years old.
###237 So there was a lot of kids there wanting to get tattooed,
###239 and I'd say, I can't touch you, your
###241 parents would get mad.
###242 I have no parents.
###243 I am alone in the world.
###244 They give you this shtick.
###246 You know half the time it's true, maybe.
###247 I don't know.
###248 There was a deaf kid named Raul.
###251 He was deaf and dumb.
###252 And he obviously couldn't speak or hear, and the older
###257 guys would let him hang around.
###258 But you'd see other guys kind of fucking with him a little
###261 bit, like teasing him and stuff.
###262 He was young, so he kept saying,
###265 I want to get tattooed.
###265 I want to get tattooed.
###267 I was like, no, no, no, no.
###269 And so after the first night, I went to dinner with Dustin
###272 and Vinnie, and fortunately, they
###275 brought it to my attention.
###276 They said this poor kid is already missing out on so much
###280 in life, like not being able to hear or speak.
###283 Other people are mocking him and teasing him and stuff.
###286 This is just like one more cool thing that's coming
###289 through town that he doesn't get to participate in.
###291 
###293 And I immediately wanted to tattoo him, but I'm
###296 like he's so young.
###298 You know what mean?
###300 I know he was 11.
###302 I got Raul, the 11-year-old, tattooed, and he got an S and
###307 an I with two periods after them.
###310 Still to this day, nobody knows what that stands for.
###313 So I said OK, we'll go to your house.
###315 I'll tattoo you and Raj again.
###318 I'll tattoo Sunny.
###319 He's like, maybe my mom wants to get tattooed.
###322 I started getting nervous as we're going to the house
###325 because I'm going to meet his mom.
###327 And I just tattooed her kid's neck.
###330 You know what I mean?
###331 So I'm like, was it OK with your mom that
###334 you guys got tattooed?
###335 Oh no.
###335 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
###336 It's totally cool.
###336 It's totally cool.
###337 I don't know if they're just telling me that because they
###339 want to get me there--
###340 it's really cool or whatever.
###342 So we show up at the house and the first thing I said after
###346 nice to meet you, was I really hope it's OK that I tattooed
###351 your sons' necks.
###352 And she was like, oh, we're Christians.
###354 I was like, oh, killer, OK.
###357 Like no problem.
