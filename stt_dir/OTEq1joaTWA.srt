1
0:0:0,469 --> 0:0:3,27
A lot of people believe


2
0:0:3,27 --> 0:0:7,339
that the things I talk about


3
0:0:7,339 --> 0:0:10,809
had been talked
about in the past.


4
0:0:10,809 --> 0:0:13,774
When I was a member
of 'Technocracy'


5
0:0:13,774 --> 0:0:17,783
they said they had
blueprints for the future.


6
0:0:17,783 --> 0:0:21,355
I never saw any.
I asked to see them.


7
0:0:21,355 --> 0:0:24,167
The only blueprint they
had was a rough [outline]


8
0:0:24,167 --> 0:0:28,587
on the continental
hydrology, irrigation


9
0:0:28,587 --> 0:0:31,941
but no real detail on it.


10
0:0:31,941 --> 0:0:37,527
How the lift locks work
on the canal or anything.


11
0:0:37,527 --> 0:0:41,895
I asked Scott how he felt
about circular cities.


12
0:0:41,895 --> 0:0:45,668
He said "No, I believe
in linear cities."


13
0:0:45,668 --> 0:0:50,429
And he did not question
"Why circular cities?"


14
0:0:50,429 --> 0:0:54,316
He just told me that we're
going to use linear cities:


15
0:0:54,316 --> 0:0:56,932
cities in a line.


16
0:0:56,932 --> 0:1:1,249
If you start here and you
go through the whole city


17
0:1:1,249 --> 0:1:4,48
you have to go back to
where you started from.


18
0:1:4,48 --> 0:1:7,54
In the circular arrangement,
if you go around


19
0:1:7,54 --> 0:1:11,294
you come back to where you started.
You don't need to go back


20
0:1:11,294 --> 0:1:13,678
and your car is there.


21
0:1:13,678 --> 0:1:18,245
In a circular plan, or
distribution center


22
0:1:18,245 --> 0:1:21,98
there are areas marked:


23
0:1:21,98 --> 0:1:25,521
refrigeration, air conditioning,
whatever it is; and you park your car


24
0:1:25,521 --> 0:1:29,894
adjacent to that, instead of just
parking in a big parking lot.


25
0:1:29,894 --> 0:1:32,653
You have to then walk over
to the shoe department


26
0:1:32,653 --> 0:1:35,3
or the eyeglass department.


27
0:1:35,3 --> 0:1:38,493
This way it's marked on the outside
of the circle what's in there.


28
0:1:38,493 --> 0:1:41,661
So you park adjacent
to that area.


29
0:1:41,661 --> 0:1:44,761
If more people use the
food shopping area


30
0:1:44,761 --> 0:1:47,98
there's a larger
parking area for that.


31
0:1:47,98 --> 0:1:50,101
But the only way to find out is:


32
0:1:50,101 --> 0:1:53,78
how many people a day
go to the food area?


33
0:1:53,78 --> 0:1:57,328
What percentage go to
the eyeglass area?


34
0:1:57,328 --> 0:2:4,248
So the parking areas are based
on that, not Fresco's decision.


35
0:2:4,248 --> 0:2:7,37
What people have to understand


36
0:2:7,37 --> 0:2:10,796
is how statistics are gathered;


37
0:2:10,796 --> 0:2:15,843
how they're decided upon, and
that's by the behavior of people.


38
0:2:15,843 --> 0:2:18,505
If most people go to
the childrens' center


39
0:2:18,505 --> 0:2:21,183
that has the largest
parking area.


40
0:2:21,183 --> 0:2:24,626
If, later on, the schools
become more efficient


41
0:2:24,626 --> 0:2:28,352
they work with less
students at a time.


42
0:2:28,352 --> 0:2:32,477
The optimum amount of students
depends on their age.


43
0:2:32,477 --> 0:2:36,713
The older people get, the more they
understand if they're exposed.


44
0:2:36,713 --> 0:2:40,351
But children...
You take a lot of children


45
0:2:40,351 --> 0:2:44,477
and you talk to them
like I'm talking to you


46
0:2:44,477 --> 0:2:47,597
and you get feedback
from the children.


47
0:2:47,597 --> 0:2:50,2
The kind of feedback you
get from the children


48
0:2:50,2 --> 0:2:54,472
determines how many children
you can effectively change


49
0:2:54,472 --> 0:2:56,671
within the given time.


50
0:2:56,671 --> 0:3:2,35
If you find out that you should
have no more than 15 kids at a time


51
0:3:2,35 --> 0:3:5,339
depending on how
sophisticated the subject is


52
0:3:5,339 --> 0:3:8,605
you have to try it and
find out how it works.


53
0:3:8,605 --> 0:3:11,658
And then when you write
your conclusions


54
0:3:11,658 --> 0:3:15,55
you say "In the
system that I use


55
0:3:15,55 --> 0:3:18,808
a certain number of children
seem to learn faster.


56
0:3:18,808 --> 0:3:22,264
I haven't tried 17
different systems yet.


57
0:3:22,264 --> 0:3:27,172
There may be other conclusions.
We welcome them."


58
0:3:27,172 --> 0:3:29,759
(Roxanne) To me, to
summarize this, it's saying


59
0:3:29,759 --> 0:3:33,499
"Why don't you give your
technology away today?"


60
0:3:33,499 --> 0:3:37,101
I'm giving you everything
I think they need


61
0:3:37,101 --> 0:3:40,669
to make this jump.


62
0:3:40,669 --> 0:3:44,485
Now they ask "Why don't
you give your ideas away


63
0:3:44,485 --> 0:3:47,334
and make them available?
After all


64
0:3:47,334 --> 0:3:50,469
what you're trying to do is
make the world a better place;


65
0:3:50,469 --> 0:3:53,176
so if you choose, just
give your ideas away."


66
0:3:53,176 --> 0:3:55,751
If I design a round city


67
0:3:55,751 --> 0:3:59,43
and I gave it away, it'll
be a commercial city.


68
0:3:59,43 --> 0:4:3,831
You couldn't move in unless
you pay so much a week.


69
0:4:3,831 --> 0:4:7,354
See, like there's so many
dentists in that city


70
0:4:7,354 --> 0:4:11,424
so many barbers not a
whole bunch of barbers


71
0:4:11,424 --> 0:4:15,206
the amount of barbers needed
to take care of that city.


72
0:4:15,206 --> 0:4:18,397
But they will rent it
out at a high price


73
0:4:18,397 --> 0:4:22,157
because opening a restaurant
in that city is a sure thing


74
0:4:22,157 --> 0:4:26,252
because there's 5,000 people.
Do you understand?


75
0:4:26,252 --> 0:4:29,77
So it becomes
commercial and damaged.


76
0:4:29,77 --> 0:4:33,336
They say "Well, what about
the good that it does?"


77
0:4:33,336 --> 0:4:37,309
Well, let's take a helicopter.
It could be used as an ambulance


78
0:4:37,309 --> 0:4:40,221
or for machine-gunning people.


79
0:4:40,221 --> 0:4:43,224
Most helicopters are used
for military purposes;


80
0:4:43,224 --> 0:4:45,702
machine-gunning people.


81
0:4:45,702 --> 0:4:49,938
The laser beam can be used
to diminish the effects of


82
0:4:49,938 --> 0:4:52,4
optical disorders.


83
0:4:52,4 --> 0:4:55,929
I mean, ophthalmology.


84
0:4:55,929 --> 0:4:59,959
Lasers can be used in surgery.


85
0:4:59,959 --> 0:5:2,721
They can also be
connected to weapons.


86
0:5:2,721 --> 0:5:6,972
If the laser beam is on the
person, the bullets come out.


87
0:5:6,972 --> 0:5:10,867
We have no evidence
to support ideas


88
0:5:10,867 --> 0:5:13,492
that were put out
there for free.


89
0:5:13,492 --> 0:5:17,968
And there are people who say "Well,
Fresco really doesn't believe in


90
0:5:17,968 --> 0:5:20,755
having his name put out there."


91
0:5:20,755 --> 0:5:23,183
I do when it comes to
a book that I wrote.


92
0:5:23,183 --> 0:5:26,837
If people ask me questions,
I can answer them.


93
0:5:26,837 --> 0:5:29,908
But if another guy
copies my book


94
0:5:29,908 --> 0:5:33,286
word for word and


95
0:5:33,286 --> 0:5:35,923
he gets a credit for that;


96
0:5:35,923 --> 0:5:39,485
and people ask him "What do you
do about this or about that?"


97
0:5:39,485 --> 0:5:44,584
They don't have that kind of background.
They can't answer questions.


98
0:5:44,584 --> 0:5:47,793
But if you check with
history, not Fresco


99
0:5:47,793 --> 0:5:50,837
you'll find that Louis Pasteur


100
0:5:50,837 --> 0:5:56,193
recommended vaccination.
It never was a team of scientists.


101
0:5:56,193 --> 0:5:58,423
You find that the
Wright brothers


102
0:5:58,423 --> 0:6:2,233
really developed the first
powered flying machine.


103
0:6:2,233 --> 0:6:4,904
So you can go and write to
the Wright brothers and say


104
0:6:4,904 --> 0:6:7,757
"How do you make your propeller?


105
0:6:7,757 --> 0:6:12,744
How much pitch does it have?
" Only they know because they made it.


106
0:6:12,744 --> 0:6:15,19
You have to go to Edison, saying


107
0:6:15,19 --> 0:6:19,476
"How do you know how much of a
vacuum to put in a glass lamp?


108
0:6:19,476 --> 0:6:22,523
How do you decide the
elements you use?"


109
0:6:22,523 --> 0:6:26,461
You have to have to go to Edison.
The gas company can't tell you that.


110
0:6:26,461 --> 0:6:29,83
When I was a kid there were people
who went around the streets


111
0:6:29,83 --> 0:6:33,896
lighting the gas lamps that
were all along the street.


112
0:6:33,896 --> 0:6:38,778
He was a lighter, with a long
pole, and he lit those lamps.


113
0:6:38,778 --> 0:6:41,922
Then, when Edison's
system came out


114
0:6:41,922 --> 0:6:45,713
he had to instruct people
as to how it worked.


115
0:6:45,713 --> 0:6:51,6
When Tesla invented the Tesla
Coil, he had to instruct people.


116
0:6:51,6 --> 0:6:53,79
But if another guy lifted it


117
0:6:53,79 --> 0:6:57,922
and he says "What's the
resistance of the wires in that?"


118
0:6:57,922 --> 0:7:1,316
They didn't know,
only Tesla knew.


119
0:7:1,316 --> 0:7:3,781
So it seems that in history


120
0:7:3,781 --> 0:7:7,406
Einstein's theory of relativity


121
0:7:7,406 --> 0:7:11,598
Pasteur, Darwin's
theory of evolution


122
0:7:11,598 --> 0:7:14,748
as against a religious concept.


123
0:7:14,748 --> 0:7:19,237
Is it perfect? No.
But it's a hell of a lot greater.


124
0:7:19,237 --> 0:7:21,565
And Darwin spent many years


125
0:7:21,565 --> 0:7:24,136
trying to put this
stuff together.


126
0:7:24,136 --> 0:7:28,891
I'm not against teaching people
physics and science. That's fine.


127
0:7:28,891 --> 0:7:32,382
That's the elements for
putting things together.


128
0:7:32,382 --> 0:7:35,417
The books that I
read by other people


129
0:7:35,417 --> 0:7:40,821
did not have all the answers.
Semantics never touched the social system.


130
0:7:40,821 --> 0:7:43,223
Jacques Loeb informed us


131
0:7:43,223 --> 0:7:48,25
a great deal about plant
tropism, geotropism


132
0:7:48,25 --> 0:7:51,15
all these things that
we knew little about


133
0:7:51,15 --> 0:7:54,29
but Jacques Loeb was
associated with it.


134
0:7:54,29 --> 0:7:57,999
So when you have the
nuclear program


135
0:7:57,999 --> 0:8:3,225
to develop the atom bomb, there
were always people in charge


136
0:8:3,225 --> 0:8:8,918
like Oppenheimer; he was in
charge of nuclear research.


137
0:8:8,918 --> 0:8:13,618
Einstein's formula helped
in nuclear research.


138
0:8:13,618 --> 0:8:18,626
There were many lead
scientists that directed that.


139
0:8:18,626 --> 0:8:22,659
When you went to Germany,
you'd find Wernher Von Braun


140
0:8:22,659 --> 0:8:24,936
as head of rocketry.


141
0:8:24,936 --> 0:8:28,314
Why was he head?
Because others didn't experiment.


142
0:8:28,314 --> 0:8:33,647
He experimented before it became
necessary to build rockets.


143
0:8:33,647 --> 0:8:36,913
He belonged to a
young German group


144
0:8:36,913 --> 0:8:39,455
in which they experimented
with rockets.


145
0:8:39,455 --> 0:8:42,574
When Hitler got in,
Hitler backed him.


146
0:8:42,574 --> 0:8:46,897
But Wernher Von Braun
had to educate


147
0:8:46,897 --> 0:8:50,334
all the scientists that
knew nothing about rockets.


148
0:8:50,334 --> 0:8:56,214
Where did he get the ideas from?
Dirty, hard work, with no financing.


149
0:8:56,214 --> 0:8:59,373
There was an American
scientist named Goddard


150
0:8:59,373 --> 0:9:2,904
who spent his own money
on rocket development


151
0:9:2,904 --> 0:9:6,326
and he was able to get
rockets to go up a mile high


152
0:9:6,326 --> 0:9:9,707
and people thought
he was a dreamer.


153
0:9:9,707 --> 0:9:15,163
And he said "If I talked about
rockets in the scientific community


154
0:9:15,163 --> 0:9:19,92
I was looked upon
as a foolish person


155
0:9:19,92 --> 0:9:22,744
who was not practical.
" Do you understand?


156
0:9:22,744 --> 0:9:26,601
Are scientists the
prime judge of things?


157
0:9:26,601 --> 0:9:29,322
No, they're not.
You have to ask Goddard


158
0:9:29,322 --> 0:9:32,9
"How do you make
your fuel combust?"


159
0:9:32,9 --> 0:9:34,675
In other words, when
you launch a rocket


160
0:9:34,675 --> 0:9:39,52
with, say, 20 pounds
of propellant


161
0:9:39,52 --> 0:9:43,151
you're lifting that 20 pounds
of propellant up there.


162
0:9:43,151 --> 0:9:48,34
So the theory of rockets is
to burn all the fuel you can


163
0:9:48,34 --> 0:9:53,126
and get the most propulsion, so
you're not lifting up the fuel, too.


164
0:9:53,126 --> 0:9:57,21
If you fill to your car with
gasoline to get to California


165
0:9:57,21 --> 0:10:1,23
you're not going to get as many
miles by filling it as you go.


166
0:10:1,23 --> 0:10:3,825
Otherwise, you're carrying
the gasoline with you.


167
0:10:3,825 --> 0:10:7,752
Somebody who found that out,
we should know who he is


168
0:10:7,752 --> 0:10:11,59
so we could question him. But


169
0:10:11,59 --> 0:10:15,154
what happens is,
it appears, that


170
0:10:15,154 --> 0:10:18,836
some members of The
Zeitgeist Movement


171
0:10:18,836 --> 0:10:22,117
and The Venus Project
think that Fresco


172
0:10:22,117 --> 0:10:25,227
picked up all these ideas from books.
No, he didn't.


173
0:10:25,227 --> 0:10:29,812
He worked his ass off,
compiling bits of information


174
0:10:29,812 --> 0:10:32,637
and taking out the
inconsistencies.


175
0:10:32,637 --> 0:10:36,603
Now, people come along and
they say (like some people do)


176
0:10:36,603 --> 0:10:40,551
they quote all the different
things of The Venus Project


177
0:10:40,551 --> 0:10:43,73
and do not quote the source.


178
0:10:43,73 --> 0:10:47,565
So they get the applause,
and they get the approval


179
0:10:47,565 --> 0:10:50,649
but they've done nothing
to arrive at these ideas


180
0:10:50,649 --> 0:10:54,99
and then they tell me
to give out ideas.


181
0:10:54,99 --> 0:10:57,953
Did they give out ideas?
Did they make any contributions?


182
0:10:57,953 --> 0:11:2,211
Did they sponsor me in
the 40 years of work?


183
0:11:2,211 --> 0:11:6,725
I had to pay for that myself, just
like Goddard had to pay for it.


184
0:11:6,725 --> 0:11:10,995
If they finance the books and
publishing, sure I'd give them away.


185
0:11:10,995 --> 0:11:13,548
It belongs to the public domain


186
0:11:13,548 --> 0:11:16,294
but we don't live in that
kind of a world now.


187
0:11:16,294 --> 0:11:19,232
So laser beams are
used on machine guns.


188
0:11:19,232 --> 0:11:23,657
When the beam is on the person, or on
the airplane, the bullets come out.


189
0:11:23,657 --> 0:11:28,83
When it's not, they don't come out.
Somebody developed that.


190
0:11:28,83 --> 0:11:30,917
And the reason they took a patent
out on it is because other people


191
0:11:30,917 --> 0:11:34,34
would take patent on it, if
they talked to them about it.


192
0:11:34,34 --> 0:11:37,646
And they would not get
paid for their research.


193
0:11:37,646 --> 0:11:41,989
It may take 10 years
to develop a laser.


194
0:11:41,989 --> 0:11:44,694
If you develop a laser
and give it to people


195
0:11:44,694 --> 0:11:47,347
you don't know what they're
going to do with it.


196
0:11:47,347 --> 0:11:50,159
You have no guarantee, and
the guy that invents it


197
0:11:50,159 --> 0:11:53,916
doesn't care what they do with it,
as long as he gets paid for it.


198
0:11:53,916 --> 0:11:56,747
People don't care if
Hitler used helicopters


199
0:11:56,747 --> 0:11:59,414
to bomb cities or as ambulances.


200
0:11:59,414 --> 0:12:2,12
I prefer that they be
used for ambulances


201
0:12:2,12 --> 0:12:5,88
or for surveying, aerial
surveyors of farm equipment


202
0:12:5,88 --> 0:12:9,63
and diseased plants.


203
0:12:9,63 --> 0:12:12,807
It isn't so much the knowledge
that science offers


204
0:12:12,807 --> 0:12:16,179
it's how it's used.


205
0:12:16,179 --> 0:12:18,822
A lot of people get
mad at technology


206
0:12:18,822 --> 0:12:21,507
but it's not the technology
they're really mad at.


207
0:12:21,507 --> 0:12:24,819
They don't know what they're mad at.
What they're mad at


208
0:12:24,819 --> 0:12:28,997
is the abuse and
misuse of technology.


209
0:12:28,997 --> 0:12:33,602
So if I put the ideas out there,
and people sign an agreement


210
0:12:33,602 --> 0:12:36,656
that those ideas will
not be used for weapons


211
0:12:36,656 --> 0:12:39,866
and they'll not be put
in the public domain


212
0:12:39,866 --> 0:12:44,217
only amongst those that are
building The Venus Project;


213
0:12:44,217 --> 0:12:47,961
otherwise, it will go off
in different directions.


214
0:12:47,961 --> 0:12:51,639
So, the invention
of the airplane


215
0:12:51,639 --> 0:12:55,702
is a wonderful thing.
It could be used to move passengers faster


216
0:12:55,702 --> 0:12:58,104
from one area to another.


217
0:12:58,104 --> 0:13:1,1
But they can also be
used to carry bombs.


218
0:13:1,1 --> 0:13:5,411
Their use depends on the
leadership of the country.


219
0:13:5,411 --> 0:13:7,604
I don't know the leadership


220
0:13:7,604 --> 0:13:10,606
that would pick up ideas
that you just put out there.


221
0:13:10,606 --> 0:13:13,164
Would they be used
for the public good?


222
0:13:13,164 --> 0:13:16,545
The doctor that told other
doctors to wash their hands


223
0:13:16,545 --> 0:13:19,67
before they did surgery


224
0:13:19,67 --> 0:13:21,729
due to childbirth fever


225
0:13:21,729 --> 0:13:24,513
he was kicked out
of the hospital


226
0:13:24,513 --> 0:13:27,977
because other doctors knew
that they couldn't see germs


227
0:13:27,977 --> 0:13:30,194
and they thought
it was a theory.


228
0:13:30,194 --> 0:13:33,855
The guy that found germs
was a millinery man.


229
0:13:33,855 --> 0:13:37,735
He worked with fabric and he
noticed germs under a microscope.


230
0:13:37,735 --> 0:13:42,221
It wasn't a scientist who found
germs, but the man's name


231
0:13:42,221 --> 0:13:47,655
is out there, in all the books on
where the microscope came from.


232
0:13:47,655 --> 0:13:50,408
If you don't know where
the microscope came from


233
0:13:50,408 --> 0:13:52,694
you don't know which
questions to ask.


234
0:13:52,694 --> 0:13:54,9
The guy that invented the
microscope would be asked


235
0:13:54,9 --> 0:13:57,593
"How did you think of it?
Where did you get the idea?"


236
0:13:57,593 --> 0:14:1,146
Well, the public doesn't know that.
If you get up and say


237
0:14:1,146 --> 0:14:3,967
"There are wonderful
instruments, x-ray machines.


238
0:14:3,967 --> 0:14:8,687
We don't need to cut the body open.
We can use fiber optics.


239
0:14:8,687 --> 0:14:12,6
Light pipes to see cancer..."


240
0:14:12,6 --> 0:14:16,57
But if you give it to people,
they don't use it appropriately.


241
0:14:16,57 --> 0:14:20,599
They use it for profit.
If you don't understand that


242
0:14:20,599 --> 0:14:25,209
look at the earnings today
of the large corporations


243
0:14:25,209 --> 0:14:30,771
that work for profit.
They don't work for the betterment of humanity.


244
0:14:30,771 --> 0:14:33,269
Doctors are supposed to
take care of people.


245
0:14:33,269 --> 0:14:36,789
That's part of the oath,
as you become a doctor.


246
0:14:36,789 --> 0:14:40,341
But if you can't afford certain
things, you don't get it.


247
0:14:40,341 --> 0:14:43,819
I'm talking of
socialized medicine


248
0:14:43,819 --> 0:14:49,315
or making medical procedures
available to everyone.


249
0:14:49,315 --> 0:14:52,11
The doctor says "How am I
going to make a living


250
0:14:52,11 --> 0:14:55,696
if I make it available?
" He's trapped in this system!


251
0:14:55,696 --> 0:14:59,325
He has to charge [money] because
he has to pay for things.


252
0:14:59,325 --> 0:15:2,628
The doctor has to pay for all
the electronic equipment


253
0:15:2,628 --> 0:15:6,786
he uses in his office.


254
0:15:6,786 --> 0:15:10,152
Hospitals have to buy materials


255
0:15:10,152 --> 0:15:13,354
and they have to pay a
contractor to put up a building.


256
0:15:13,354 --> 0:15:17,327
They don't put a building where
the guy's going to treat people.


257
0:15:17,327 --> 0:15:22,157
So, they put up a building, then they
think of all the staff working there


258
0:15:22,157 --> 0:15:25,232
and the people that invested
in putting up the building:


259
0:15:25,232 --> 0:15:30,368
there are people that invest, and
they put up the money for a return


260
0:15:30,368 --> 0:15:33,762
on their investment.
You've got to understand


261
0:15:33,762 --> 0:15:36,993
that that is a predatory system


262
0:15:36,993 --> 0:17:36,993
where everybody makes money
on any human disorder.
