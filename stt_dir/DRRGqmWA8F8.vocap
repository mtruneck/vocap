###2 October this year.
###3 Around the world, devoted fans
###5 mourned the death of Steve Jobs,
###8 the force of nature behind Apple.
###11 He distorted reality. It's a mixture of charisma, chutzpah,
###16 bullshit, self-belief, self-delusion,
###19 and insane ambition.
###24 Apple's hi-tech products have inspired fervour.
###27 Oh, it's beautiful. It's very sexy.
###30 Defining cool consumerism for a worldwide tribe.
###34 Hyped by the man who personified the brand.
###38 It works like magic.
###40 They look so good, you want to lick 'em.
###42 It's unbelievable.
###44 No-one had quite that mixture of arrogance,
###47 humility, talent and presence, which Steve Jobs had.
###50 He's changed music, he's changed movies, he's changed computers a couple of times.
###55 He's created industries that we didn't think we needed.
###59 Jobs was a perfectionist.
###61 To Steve, everything was about taste. Just like someone writing a great piece of music.
###65 And a tyrant.
###67 Steve Jobs yelling at you with his full force is kind of
###70 a pretty frightening thing for most people.
###74 How did a drug-taking college dropout
###76 create one of the most successful corporations in the world?
###79 His hippy background made him a better billionaire.
###84 This is the inside story
###86 of how Steve Jobs took Apple
###88 from a suburban garage to global supremacy.
###99 This is the launch of the Macintosh computer in 1984.
###104 An early glimpse of the way Apple has marketed itself
###108 to the world ever since.
###113 MUSIC: "Chariots Of Fire" by Vangelis
###125 The Macintosh was the first computer
###127 with a mouse that was meant for all of us.
###130 It has turned out insanely great.
###134 APPLAUSE
###139 We were all very idealistic and passionate.
###142 This was our personal cause.
###147 In this auditorium, three crucial factors
###150 came together for the first time.
###151 A new computer designed to be easier to use
###155 than any that had come before.
###157 Sold with an audacious message of revolution.
###162 And hyped by Steve Jobs himself.
###166 I'd like to open the meeting with a an old poem by Dylan. That's Bob Dylan.
###169 LAUGHTER
###171 Come writers and critics who prophesise with your pens
###175 And keep your eyes wide...
###177 What started here in 1984, with the launch of the Mac
###180 became the template that certainly got improved upon as Apple became
###185 one of the great marketing companies that the world has ever seen.
###188 ..for the loser now will be later to win
###191 for the times they are a-changin'.
###193 APPLAUSE
###195 The whole auditorium of about 2,500 people
###198 gave it a standing ovation.
###201 It was a very, very emotional moment because it was no longer ours.
###205 From that day forward, it was no loner ours, we couldn't change it.
###209 Jobs cast Apple as the plucky underdog,
###212 taking on a domineering rival.
###214 IBM wants it all
###217 and is aiming its guns on its last obstacle to industry control - Apple.
###223 Will big blue dominate the entire computer industry?
###228 The entire information age?
###231 Was George Orwell right about 1984?
###236 APPLAUSE
###237 'We celebrate the first glorious anniversary...'
###241 Apple created an advert that painted IBM as Big Brother.
###247 the enemy of freedom.
###249 These images have helped define Apple as a brand ever since.
###255 'We shall prevail.'
###260 That was the birth of the Apple brand.
###264 It was talked about
###266 and it was literally focusing on a revolution.
###269 And that revolutionary theme was absolutely at the core
###272 of what made Apple successful over the next years.
###276 The 1984 ad was the first time
###278 when you started to get a real sense of the Apple club.
###282 People who defined themselves by their association with the brand.
###285 That they weren't IBM clones, they were these creative thinkers
###288 who had a different attitude, in some way.
###292 I think that's been the kind of common currency
###294 that's been carried on since then.
###296 Nearly three decades on,
###299 Apple was still following the marketing template
###300 set out all those years ago.
###304 This year, Steve Jobs was centre stage for the launch
###308 of its latest tablet.
###309 And just like in 1984, his pitch
###313 was that Apple stands for something more than selling computers.
###317 It's in Apple's DNA
###319 that technology alone is not enough.
###324 That it's technology married with liberal arts,
###328 married with the humanities
###330 that yields us the result that makes our hearts sing.
###335 From the launch of the Macintosh
###338 to the unveiling of the latest iPad,
###340 two events, which span a quarter of a century,
###343 and yet which reveal a consistent vision in the company Jobs created.
###348 It wasn't a vision born of a business school education.
###351 It wasn't a product of consumer focus groups.
###354 The roots of that vision
###356 lay in the Californian counter culture in which he grew up.
###363 MUSIC: "The Times They Are A-Changin'" by Bob Dylan
###367 # Come gather round, people wherever you roam... #
###372 The young Steve Jobs came to believe technology
###376 COULD change the world.
###380 In California in the 1960s and '70s,
###383 Jobs found himself at the centre of two colliding worlds.
###388 The hippy movement
###389 and computers.
###391 # Oh, the times, they are a-changin'... #
###397 We spent a lot of time driving around in his old Volvo.
###400 I don't remember ever listening to anything other than Bob Dylan tapes.
###404 We would play them over and over again.
###408 Born in 1955, Jobs was adopted by a modest family
###413 and grew up in the Santa Clara Valley.
###416 It was becoming better known as Silicon Valley
###419 as hi-tech firms sprang up.
###427 And nearby,
###429 San Francisco was becoming the epicentre of the counter culture.
###432 Jobs opened himself up to both.
###436 He's got a lot of compartments in his mind.
###439 He was intense and thoughtful and I liked that about him.
###445 At college, Jobs met Daniel Kottke.
###448 Jobs quickly dropped out of his course
###451 and lost no time tuning in.
###453 We both got copies of this new book, Be Here Now.
###457 It was written by Ram Dass and all about his trip to India,
###462 searching for a holy man who could explain what psychedelics do.
###466 It was fascinating for me
###468 and for Steve also and so that was the basis of our friendship.
###475 Jobs became a hippy,
###477 pursuing paths to personal liberation.
###480 He and Kottke took their own trip to India,
###484 and LSD, as this extraordinary tape reveals.
###504 He spent long periods at a commune on a farm in Oregon.
###508 We spent a whole week harvesting apples and, while we were at it,
###512 we decided we would just fast on apples and see how that worked
###516 and, um...
###518 it makes you very light-headed, cos it's just like sugar.
###522 Jobs was inspired by the counter culture
###524 to believe society was there to be reshaped.
###528 As near as I can tell,
###529 Steve Jobs always had that ambition to change the world.
###533 And he expected to do that by empowering, um...
###538 everybody.
###541 But Jobs didn't share all the views of his counter culture buddies.
###544 Many hippies saw computers as tools of oppression,
###547 produced by big businesses
###549 to extend the sway of other big businesses.
###553 Jobs, though, had grown up experimenting with electronics at home.
###558 People who've done that
###560 have another angle on, er, whether technology is bad or good.
###565 They think that technology that pushes them around is bad
###569 and technology that they can
###570 push in their own direction they think is good.
###573 While he was still at school,
###575 Jobs worked at one of the big computer companies near his home in Silicon Valley.
###579 And he made a friend who would shape his destiny.
###583 We talked about electronics. I said, "I design computers.
###586 "I can, you know, do any of them." He had worked at Hewlett Packard
###589 and built himself what's called a frequency counter.
###591 So we hit it off.
###592 Despite his hippy outlook, Jobs had a ruthless streak.
###597 He was asked by the fledgling computer company Atari to design a new Breakout game.
###602 Jobs asked Wozniak to do it in just four days,
###605 telling his friend they would share the fee.
###608 He presented it like we were splitting the money 50/50,
###611 but actually, it was, you know, probably a different story.
###615 Wozniak worked round the clock to deliver the goods
###619 but later discovered Jobs had paid him considerably less
###622 than half the sum he had received from Atari.
###628 You didn't think, "I can't trust this guy"?
###630 or "He's a bit too sharp for me"?
###632 Steve could have just said,
###633 "I need money to buy into this commune up in Oregon."
###636 Have you never harboured any bitterness that he might have? I don't harbour bitterness.
###641 Even if somebody just did that right to my face, I would not harbour bitterness.
###645 But I would acknowledge the truth. Um, I did cry.
###648 I cried, you know, quite a bit, actually, when I read it in a book.
###652 The seeds of Apple were sown when Wozniak introduced Jobs
###658 to a subterranean world of DIY technology enthusiasts.
###664 The Homebrew Computer Club had ideas of how small, little people
###669 who knew things about computers
###671 could change the world, could become masters.
###674 The Homebrew Computer Club took computing
###677 out of the hands of big business.
###682 What happened was you wanted a computer or a piece of software
###686 or some product that didn't exist.
###688 You looked around, it didn't exist. So you built it.
###690 Then you showed it to your friends, cos everyone wants to show off,
###694 and your friends would say, "This is great, can I have one?"
###697 The values were sharing. If you have parts that can help people.
###701 If you have knowledge, you'll share.
###703 Wozniak brought Jobs to the Homebrew Computer Club
###706 where he was showing a new computer he had made.
###710 It would become the Apple I.
###713 He saw a business opportunity that all these people wanted to build
###717 my computer design, but they didn't have building skills.
###721 And he thought, "We'll put out some money,
###723 "design a PC board, we'll make it for $20, we'll sell it for $40."
###728 And I didn't know if we'd sell enough to get our money back.
###732 We'd have to sell about 50.
###734 And I didn't know if there were 50 people who would buy my computer.
###737 And Steve said, "Yeah, maybe we won't get our money back,
###741 "but then for once in our lives,
###742 "finally, the two of us will have our own company."
###745 Wow, man. He was... OK, he was the leader on that.
###749 In 1976, Wozniak and Jobs began selling the Apple I computer
###754 from the Jobs family garage.
###757 Buyers had to add their own case.
###760 The birth of Apple as a company had been masterminded by Jobs,
###764 a hippy with a business brain.
###767 A surprising number of people who came along as hippies
###771 and counter-culture folks in the '60s and '70s
###774 wound up going into business.
###776 Business was a way to have some freedom in the world.
###780 Steve Jobs later said he'd set up the business almost by chance.
###784 We started Apple simply because we wanted this computer for ourselves
###788 and our immediate friends wanted one once they saw us build a prototype.
###792 So gradually, we were pulled into business.
###794 We didn't set out to build a large company.
###796 We started out to build computers for us and our friends.
###799 To Apple's co-founder, the reality is a little less idealistic.
###805 Steve was always sort of focussed on if you can build things
###808 and sell them, you can have a company. And the way you make money
###811 and importance in the world is with companies.
###814 And he always spoke that he wanted to be one of those important people.
###818 So he'd got the business side pretty clearly.
###820 He got the business side but he did tie it in philosophically with,
###824 "This is how you get good things to people."
###827 It wasn't, "I only want money."
###831 It was Wozniak's next computer,
###833 which propelled Apple into the stratosphere.
###836 Released in 1977,
###838 the Apple II was the first home computer with colour graphics.
###845 Over the next three years, sales grew rapidly
###848 to more than $150 million,
###851 taking Apple from a suburban garage to the pinnacle of a new industry...
###856 personal computing.
###858 There are some great partnerships, aren't there, in the world?
###861 One thinks of Lennon and McCartney and you and Steve Jobs.
###864 Who was Lennon, who was McCartney?
###866 I am so honoured to be considered in that kind of category,
###871 and yet it's true, it's true.
###873 You know, Steve and I, we were like a...
###875 Lennon McCartney partnership, exactly. I couldn't say who was who.
###879 I always thought people always attributed me with Lennon
###882 because I had really built and designed the machines.
###886 And then Steve knew how to take it to the public.
###888 Um, but he had, you know, his own type of brilliance too.
###891 When Apple went public in 1980, it was the most over-subscribed
###896 offering of shares since that of Ford motors in 1956.
###901 Success on this scale changed Apple.
###905 Any company when it becomes public
###907 and becomes bigger becomes different. Politics seep in.
###911 The company goal from that point on wasn't to change the world,
###915 but to increase the value to shareholders.
###918 It certainly did that.
###921 It was worth nearly $2 billion by the end of 1980.
###924 And Jobs had a quarter of a billion.
###926 But now money men and women flooded in to Apple,
###930 and Jobs, just 25, wasn't really taken seriously by them.
###934 Steve was the chairman, but he wasn't seen as the person
###939 who had the stature and the maturity to run the company.
###945 Especially as the world around Apple was changing fast.
###949 Competition in the personal computer market was intensifying.
###952 In 1981, IBM launched its response to the Apple II -
###956 The IBM PC.
###959 'A computer expert will show you the system that's right for you.'
###963 It was the opening shot of a battle that would rage for 15 years.
###968 Apple went from the leading personal computer company
###972 to the second-place company
###974 and actually, was in a very precarious position in that
###977 because the IBM system could be used in companies other than IBM
###984 and you could see where Apple would fall further and further back.
###991 Apple needed a seasoned Chief Executive to pilot the company
###994 through increasingly tough times.
###997 Steve Jobs' search took him to New York
###999 and to John Sculley, President of the soft drinks company, Pepsi.
###1004 The two men began poles apart.
###1007 The world I came from was hierarchical.
###1009 It was big business. It was very competitive
###1014 and the idea of building a company that was going to change the world
###1019 was completely foreign from anything that I'd ever been exposed to.
###1024 How Jobs persuaded Sculley to take the job
###1027 is the stuff of business legend.
###1029 Steve had these deep penetrating, brown eyes
###1034 and he just stared right at me, probably, you know, 15 inches away.
###1039 He said, "Do you want to sell sugar water for the rest of your life,
###1042 "or do you want to come with me and change the world?"
###1047 Kind of knocked the wind out of me,
###1048 because no-one had ever said anything like that to me before.
###1052 Sculley was a pragmatic operator,
###1055 a marketing expert who knew exactly what Apple should do.
###1058 What they needed was someone who could keep the Apple II
###1062 commercially alive and generating cash for about another three years.
###1067 After several new product lines had failed to take off,
###1070 the income from the Apple II was keeping the company alive.
###1075 But Apple's hopes of a revival rested on a new home computer,
###1078 the Macintosh, named after a variety of Apple.
###1084 Jobs set out to build a computer that would blow IBM's PC away.
###1090 There was enough of the ordinary corporate executive about him
###1093 to want to beat a rival.
###1095 But there was little else conventional about Steve Jobs.
###1099 He wanted computers to be simple and pleasurable to use.
###1102 He wanted our relationship with them to be more human and intimate.
###1106 And that approach to technology has been Apple's hallmark ever since.
###1115 The Macintosh team was full of rebel spirit.
###1118 We were all young, we were all the same age, and we all thought
###1122 we could do better than has ever been done before.
###1125 Jobs thought it would take a year to build the Macintosh.
###1129 In fact, it would take more than three.
###1131 He's got a "reality distortion field".
###1135 Steve wanted the impossible
###1137 and he was somehow able to convince everyone
###1139 that the impossible was possible.
###1142 Jobs was determined the Macintosh would be easy to use.
###1147 It would have a mouse and icons on screen,
###1150 a first for an affordable personal computer.
###1153 The story of how Jobs brought that mouse to the world
###1156 explodes a myth about him -
###1158 That he invented revolutionary technology.
###1161 You see, Jobs didn't operate in an intellectual vacuum.
###1165 Nearby, in Silicon Valley, the Xerox corporation had a research division
###1171 called PARC.
###1172 'And the function of spatial frequency is something like this.'
###1176 It was full of free-thinking technological radicals
###1180 and inspirational ideas.
###1182 It was just a kind of dream place.
###1186 We had a general overall vision about what we called
###1191 "the office of the future."
###1192 And that was it. We were told to figure out how to do that.
###1196 Jobs was desperate to take a look inside
###1199 this precious storehouse of ideas.
###1201 He got his chance when Xerox made an investment in Apple
###1205 and invited him in.
###1207 I demonstrated various technologies that our group had,
###1211 but the things that stood out to the visitors
###1213 were the pointing device, the mouse, which we hadn't invented.
###1217 It had been around for 15 years. We had just improved it,
###1220 but it wasn't something that most people had ever seen before.
###1223 Larry Tesler was demonstrating how a computer with icons
###1227 on the screen could be controlled by this novel gadget. A mouse.
###1232 Jobs couldn't believe what he was seeing.
###1235 He started pacing around the room very nervously almost,
###1239 and then more excitedly and then he just couldn't hold it back.
###1243 He just had to talk.
###1244 So, he started saying things like, "You're sitting on a gold mine.
###1250 "This is insanely great. It is just amazing.
###1253 "Why aren't you doing anything with this?"
###1255 Unlike the vast XEROX corporation, Jobs acted swiftly.
###1260 I went into his office, sat down and said,
###1262 "Steve, I've been thinking about a few product ideas"
###1266 and hardly had I got the sentence out and he said, "Stop, Dean.
###1270 "I know exactly what we need to do."
###1272 When he said "a mouse", I looked at him and said "A mouse?"
###1275 I had no clue what a mouse was.
###1278 Xerox saw the mouse as part of an expensive business computer.
###1283 Jobs saw it very differently.
###1285 He gave me a very clear design brief.
###1287 The mouse had to have four things.
###1289 The first was we had to be able to build it for less than $15.
###1293 Low cost consumer product. Secondly, it had to last for two years.
###1297 Third, it needed to work on a regular desktop, Formica or metal.
###1300 And then, finally, he leaned back in his chair,
###1303 put his hand on his knee and he said, "And work on my Levi's."
###1306 The mouse, as we now know it, was born.
###1309 Jobs had tweaked existing technology to great effect,
###1313 just as he would over the next three decades.
###1316 More editor than inventor, Jobs had an instinct for innovation,
###1320 pouncing on a good idea when he saw one.
###1323 The difference between invention and innovation is that you execute.
###1329 You take an, an idea and you turn it into reality.
###1332 You bring it into the marketplace. Steve connected the dots.
###1336 He saw a little bit of this, he saw a little bit of that,
###1339 and he said, "We need to do this.
###1340 "We need to take it from an expensive business experience
###1343 "to a personal low-cost experience and we'll build a company from it."
###1349 Along with making the Macintosh easy to use,
###1352 Jobs brought an aesthetic sensibility
###1355 to the computer's design.
###1356 A long-time follower of Zen meditation,
###1359 he believed in the beauty of simplicity.
###1362 When I went to his home for the first time,
###1364 I was struck because there was almost no furniture in the house.
###1369 Um...in his bedroom was a small bed,
###1373 a photograph of Einstein over his bed,
###1375 another photograph of Gandhi.
###1378 In the living room was a Tiffany lamp,
###1381 no place to sit. You know, we would just sit on the floor.
###1385 Steve just was not into possessions.
###1387 He was not into money, he was completely into
###1390 the things he believed in.
###1394 That integrity went through every aspect of his life.
###1398 His devotion to the products, to the work, to the ethic.
###1404 It permeated everything and this desire for aesthetic beauty
###1408 the importance of the things that you don't see,
###1412 what lies beneath the surface, and in that sense,
###1416 I think there's a kind of seamless philosophy
###1419 that binds everything together.
###1423 As the Macintosh neared completion,
###1427 the stakes were growing higher for Apple.
###1430 In autumn 1983, the company's share price tumbled,
###1433 wiping nearly half a billion dollars from its value.
###1436 A new home computer was on its way from IBM
###1439 and other versions of the PC were flooding the market.
###1443 Worse still, the man Apple had turned to, to write extra software
###1447 for the Mac was about to steal a march on them.
###1450 Relations with the young Bill Gates were strained from the start.
###1456 Bill Gates would fly down from Seattle,
###1458 down to Cupertino to give updates on the project.
###1462 And, often times, Steve would just yell at Bill for two straight hours.
###1466 And then Bill would leave and get on a plane and fly back.
###1473 We tend to think of Bill Gates as a buttoned-up geek,
###1476 but in this instance, it was Jobs who showed he was far from laidback.
###1481 He thought Apple should keep complete control of its software and hardware,
###1486 Gates wanted to produce software for both Apple and the PC.
###1490 Tensions came to a head when they were both working on the Macintosh.
###1495 Jobs began to suspect Gates might be taking advantage
###1498 of his inside knowledge of Apple's work.
###1502 Steve Jobs was racing to ensure the Macintosh
###1505 was the first personal computer to have icons on the screen.
###1509 But just before it was due to be unveiled,
###1512 Microsoft suddenly announced Windows I for the PC,
###1515 which Apple feared would be similar.
###1518 Jobs couldn't contain his fury.
###1520 Steve was saying, "How can you do this to us?
###1523 "We trusted you, you betrayed us."
###1524 And I was impressed with Bill Gate's demeanour
###1529 because Steve Jobs yelling at you with his full force is kind of a...
###1533 a pretty frightening thing for most people!
###1535 But he was kind of cool and calm.
###1538 Just looked Steve back in the eye and said, "Well, Steve,
###1541 "you know, what you're saying is one way of looking at it,
###1544 "but I look at it a different way.
###1546 "It's more like you had a rich neighbour named Xerox
###1549 "and I broke into their house to steal the television set
###1552 "and found you had stolen it before I could."
###1558 Finally, after three years and millions of dollars,
###1562 the Macintosh computer was ready.
###1566 It was the distillation of Steve Jobs' vision
###1569 of what technology should be.
###1571 Easy to use, intimate,
###1573 intended to change the lives of ordinary people.
###1577 The future of Apple rested on this strikingly-designed beige box.
###1582 Computers before the Macintosh kept us at arms length.
###1586 The only way we can control them was through painstakingly moving
###1589 this crazy little cursor on the screen
###1592 and it looked like an alien device with these glowing green letters.
###1597 The Macintosh put it on human scale.
###1599 COMPUTER: Hello, I am Macintosh.
###1602 For the first time it was actually, you know, intuitive.
###1607 If you were bright enough to walk around unaided,
###1609 you could just turn it on and use it.
###1612 The Macintosh would be a hit with graphic designers
###1615 and create the desktop publishing era.
###1617 Those of us who used Apples, who got up early
###1620 because we were excited about the fact
###1621 we were in a world full of glide and flow and smoothness and pleasure,
###1627 were told that we were pretentious, posing, bohemian arty types.
###1632 "It's all very well for you, but I've got to do officey things",
###1637 were missing the point.
###1639 But however good it was, the Mac cost $2,500,
###1644 over $1,000 more than an IBM PC.
###1648 Even so, Steve Jobs was in no doubt it would take the world by storm.
###1653 Like all great entrepreneurs, in Steve's mind,
###1656 "Why wouldn't everybody on the planet immediately buy a Mac"?
###1660 So he had huge expectations.
###1662 Expectations that were about to collide with the real world.
###1665 Then the sales numbers started coming in
###1669 and, at best, they were half of what we were expecting.
###1672 One of Steve's great strengths is his strong will
###1675 and imposing his own version of reality.
###1678 So in the face of depressing sales numbers he wasn't really fazed.
###1684 Apple's new Macintosh factory was running at 50% of capacity.
###1688 We did lose money and that was a huge crisis for everybody.
###1692 Of course, that engendered a panic at Apple.
###1695 You know, "What was the problem? How can we fix it?"
###1699 And there, there was disagreement between different people.
###1704 The most serious disagreement was between Steve Jobs
###1708 and the man he had made Chief Executive, John Sculley.
###1712 Steve has a tendency to be binary about people
###1715 You know, sort of, he flipped on John Sculley.
###1718 The two men were battling over the future of Apple.
###1724 I was focused on the cash-flow of the Apple II.
###1727 We had to have that coming in.
###1729 Steve wanted to drop the price of the Macintosh,
###1732 and put more marketing against the Macintosh.
###1734 I felt we couldn't afford that.
###1736 30-year-old Jobs had picked a fight with a formidable foe.
###1740 Sculley came from PepsiCo, a very political organisation,
###1743 and he was a skilful infighter
###1745 who knew how to play the games, and Steve didn't.
###1752 I said, "Steve, I'm going to the board of directors."
###1755 He didn't think I'd do that, but I did,
###1757 and the board said, "We agree with John.
###1760 "We don't agree with you, Steve."
###1762 They asked Steve to step down from heading the Macintosh division.
###1767 Jobs had been forced out of the company he had created.
###1771 It was a humiliating taste of failure.
###1775 I got a phone call, late at night and it was Steve.
###1778 He sounded really despondent and very, very sad.
###1783 And I knew he was all alone at his great big unfurnished mansion
###1786 up in Woodside.
###1788 I got in my car, drove up there, and it was totally dark
###1791 and rather creepy, and I found the house
###1794 and went in and climbed up stairs by myself and found him
###1798 in his bedroom just laying down and he was very, very sad.
###1803 And I just stayed there, as a friend.
###1807 11 years later, Jobs was still bitter.
###1810 What can I say? I hired the wrong guy.
###1813 That was Sculley? Yeah,
###1815 and, er, he destroyed everything I'd spent ten years working for.
###1822 Erm, starting with me, but that wasn't the saddest part.
###1826 I'd have gladly left Apple if Apple had turned out like I wanted it to.
###1831 Sacking Jobs seemed natural to the man schooled in selling sugar water.
###1838 In hindsight, that was a terrible decision. I was part of it.
###1842 Coming from my vantage point, out of corporate America,
###1847 people were asked to step down all the time when there were disagreements
###1850 so I didn't appreciate what it meant to be a founder of a business,
###1855 the visionary of the business.
###1857 I was focused on how do we sell Apple computers,
###1860 he was focused on how do we change the world?
###1864 Jobs severed all ties with Apple, except one.
###1868 He kept a single share in the company he had founded,
###1871 selling off the rest for more than $100 million.
###1876 He hated the company. He couldn't see that it would succeed without him.
###1881 He didn't want it to succeed without him.
###1884 Over the next 11 years, Jobs didn't relent.
###1887 Once again centre stage, he set up a new company called Next, building high spec computers.
###1894 With cases made of magnesium and a price to match, they didn't sell well.
###1898 Though one important computer scientist was impressed.
###1902 Steve Jobs had arranged that,
###1903 whenever you get a Next machine,
###1905 there would be a message from him.
###1907 One of the things I remember he said was that it's not just about personal computing, which was the rage,
###1913 he said this should be about interpersonal computing.
###1917 And I thought, yeah, that's... Yeah, he's got it.
###1922 Jobs recognised technology was on the cusp of allowing us to communicate through computers.
###1927 And, in fact, the Next's powerful operating system
###1932 helped Sir Tim Berners-Lee connect computer users together.
###1936 I developed the World Wide Web on this Next machine in a couple of months,
###1940 whereas on another machine it would've taken me a lot longer.
###1943 YOU ARE A TOY!
###1946 As well as high-tech,
###1949 Jobs invested in a struggling computer animation company.
###1952 He ploughed $50 million into Pixar, keeping it afloat
###1956 until it created the first computer-animated feature film.
###1960 Toy Story was a blockbuster,
###1963 and taking Pixar public made Steve Jobs super rich.
###1967 He did stay in there and made the company successful,
###1970 and we made him a billionaire in return.
###1973 Seems like a pretty good deal.
###1975 Now the hippy computer mogul had become a Hollywood player.
###1979 Jobs had the world, but he didn't have Apple.
###1983 They say that there are no second acts in American life,
###1986 but there clearly are.
###1988 One of the astonishing things about the Apple phenomenon
###1991 is it goes in two halves.
###1995 In the 11 years since Jobs left Apple,
###1998 the computer market had changed radically.
###2001 Now Microsoft was the dominant force in computing.
###2005 Its operating systems powered nearly 90% of personal computers in America.
###2011 Apple had tried to compete
###2012 by allowing other manufacturers to make and sell copies of its machines and software,
###2017 but it wasn't working.
###2021 The company had lost its lead in the computer market,
###2023 customers were leaving in droves, the company had no future, no roadmap.
###2028 The company was in serious trouble.
###2034 I, and other Apple users, were being told with malicious grins
###2038 from our Windows-using friends that if we wanted to keep our machines
###2041 we'd have to go to hobbyist shops because there would be no Apple computer.
###2046 At Next, Jobs had focused on developing its powerful operating system.
###2052 Apple needed just such a system.
###2056 Apple was in technical trouble.
###2058 Next was absolutely in financial trouble, and the two came together.
###2065 Apple bought Next for $400 million.
###2069 It got the new operating system it needed, and Steve Jobs.
###2073 Steve was truly excited to be linked up with Apple again.
###2078 It was the company he founded, the company he was kicked out of.
###2083 It's the company that had lost its way, it was starting to fail,
###2086 so he had this opportunity to go back and start fixing Apple at large.
###2092 A few days later, Apple revealed just how much trouble it was really in.
###2097 They announced that they were going to lose something like $1 billion,
###2102 and back then $1 billion was a lot of money.
###2105 I said, "Steve, what did we just get ourselves into?"
###2110 And he was wondering himself! Because this was a big surprise to us.
###2114 To bring Apple back from the brink,
###2117 Jobs had a conventional business challenge.
###2119 He had to stop the company haemorrhaging money,
###2121 but he also had to do more.
###2123 He had to help the company rediscover itself,
###2127 and for that he thought he needed to take it back to the future,
###2131 to the values that had built it up in the first place.
###2135 He decided to put all of Apple's products and people under review.
###2140 He was demanding, erm, he would not hesitate to call someone at two o'clock in the morning
###2147 if he had an idea that he wanted to be pursued.
###2150 He had no time for people that he did not respect.
###2153 It got so bad that people were afraid to get into the elevator with Steve.
###2156 He was on the fourth floor of the first building
###2159 when you first come in, and it's been rumoured that he's fired people
###2162 in that 25-second elevator ride as he walked out of the elevator.
###2167 It wasn't just people who were axed.
###2171 Jobs ended the licensing of Apple's technology to other companies,
###2175 and he killed off most of Apple's product lines,
###2177 including a clunky handheld device, the Newton.
###2184 He taught the company what he learned
###2187 when he was at Next and Pixar,
###2190 which was focus matters.
###2193 Watching expenses matters.
###2196 We'll do more if we do less.
###2200 Here's to the crazy ones.
###2203 The misfits, the rebels.
###2205 The troublemakers.
###2207 Always the marketing man, now Jobs started to talk Apple up
###2211 with a TV advert called Think Different.
###2214 This emotional recasting of Apple's rebel roots was about more than just the brand.
###2221 The real reason Think Different was created was for the employees.
###2224 It really meant a wake-up, a call to action,
###2229 a call to arms for the employees to say, "Wait a minute,
###2231 "we still have something great to do for the world."
###2234 Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world...
###2239 ..are the ones who do.
###2246 After renewing Apple's sense of its own identity,
###2250 Jobs needed a product that could bring about the company's financial revival.
###2254 He had a new vision of what computers could be,
###2258 and it centred on an unknown Apple employee, British designer Jonathan Ive,
###2263 who'd been working on an unusual prototype for a new computer.
###2267 He went into Steve's office, and he came out ten minutes later,
###2270 and sort of leant against the wall, not quite believing what he'd heard,
###2274 which was, "We're going to stop everything at Apple and we're going to make this prototype of yours."
###2280 Johnny said, "You do know that the prototype is transparent and that's how I want it to be?"
###2285 Steve said, "Sure."
###2289 This...is iMac.
###2292 APPLAUSE
###2296 The whole thing is translucent, you can see into it. It's so cool.
###2302 Jobs and Ive had put the design of the computer centre stage.
###2307 It created quite a stir.
###2310 It looks like it's from another planet, and a good planet!
###2314 AUDIENCE LAUGHTER
###2316 A planet with better designers.
###2319 Behold this extraordinary transparent object.
###2323 It was friendly!
###2324 It's a silly thing to say! It looked like a nice thing to own.
###2328 The back of this thing looks better than the front of the other guy's by the way!
###2332 This was a desktop computer
###2334 but conceived as a thing of pleasure, ironic fascination.
###2338 It meant that, you know, a computer wasn't just a dreary piece of office equipment.
###2342 They look so good, you kind of want to lick 'em.
###2345 The iMac fused striking design with the ability to connect to the internet easily.
###2351 Steve was super-proud of the design
###2353 and also the idea that he called it the iMac and the "i" for internet.
###2357 The "i" was a stroke of deft branding,
###2359 transforming the new impersonal internet into something more intimate.
###2365 The iMac was a huge success and propelled Apple back into profit.
###2370 In four and a half months, iMac has become the number one selling computer in America.
###2374 The iMac was no better a product than the computer it replaced
###2379 but it was packaged and marketed in a way that became classic Steve Jobs.
###2383 It was the sort of packaging that attracted people
###2386 who'd previously had no interest in computers.
###2389 A third of sales were to those who'd never bought one before.
###2393 Who'd have thought you could have an emotional bond with your computer?
###2397 Apple wanted to change people's relationship with computers.
###2402 Steve wanted it to be fashionable but it was Jonathan who was saying,
###2406 "We have to make this something that people will love."
###2409 The word "love" started becoming part of Apple's motif.
###2414 And now there was a new partnership at the heart of Apple.
###2418 Jonathan Ive and Jobs had a very, very, very special relationship
###2423 and it was united by this almost Zen-like meditative intensity, which they both have.
###2431 Ive's approach to design would be the new foundation on which Apple's future would be built.
###2437 You've got this incredibly powerful, this potent technology and people,
###2441 and I think design makes a very sort of important, erm...
###2444 ..I think, contribution to the nature of that connection.
###2447 I think we're trying to create products that make sense,
###2451 and that people really develop some sort of affinity with.
###2456 They are products that become personal.
###2459 There is a poetic dimension to some technological artefacts
###2464 because they have been crafted into it, and that is not accidental.
###2468 It's absolutely part of a mission, a focus, and part of the functionality.
###2474 And over the years, Apple has generally positioned its products
###2477 as expensive, but oh-so-elegantly designed.
###2481 There are people who say, when you compare the Apple product with the functional equivalent...
###2486 ..You see that it's more style over substance.
###2489 No, no, no! Evan, you couldn't be more wrong.
###2493 I wouldn't wish to be rude to you
###2495 but it's astonishing to think that, in the 21st-century,
###2499 people still think there's a distinction between style and substance,
###2502 that the two are not the same.
###2506 The better it looks, the more you want to use it, the more function you get out of it anyway!
###2512 Around the turn-of-the-century, technology was changing rapidly.
###2517 Consumers were rushing to buy new digital devices like cameras and music players,
###2521 and Jobs saw how Apple could weave itself deeper into people's lives,
###2527 IF it could exploit the trend.
###2530 We are living in a new digital lifestyle with an explosion of digital devices,
###2536 and we believe that the Mac can become the digital hub of our new emerging digital lifestyle.
###2544 We think this is going to be huge.
###2548 Jobs' insight was the beginning of Apple as we know it today.
###2552 Computers were becoming powerful enough to store and play video, music and other media.
###2558 Apple began working secretly on a digital device of its own.
###2563 It would revolutionise the company and our increasingly digital world.
###2568 The iPod came about because somewhat of a convergence of technologies.
###2573 We learned that we could marry a really small hard drive -
###2577 small in size, large in capacity - with some small electronics
###2582 and build a really good music player.
###2586 Just as with the mouse in the 1980s, Jobs and Apple did not invent the MP3 player,
###2592 but they did redefine it for consumers.
###2596 The iPod could hold 1,000 songs,
###2600 but its real innovation lay in Jonathan Ive's design.
###2604 There were lots of MP3 players around before the iPod
###2608 but they all looked as ugly as car batteries and it was only Apple
###2611 who had the sense to make the iPod into a gorgeous, gorgeous thing.
###2616 The colour of the first iPod was no accident.
###2619 Choosing white for the iPod wasn't just a Johnny decision, it was a Johnny and Steve decision.
###2624 They really looked into the idea of the colour white.
###2628 It was something, which carried on a certain spirit and purity.
###2635 They went to many, many iterations of white and had to look at special materials, special polymers,
###2641 to produce and convey and maintain the certain whiteness of the iPod.
###2647 Carefully chosen colours, white or otherwise,
###2649 had a distinctive presence in the advertising.
###2653 And with this product, unlike some in the past,
###2656 Apple was not going to overestimate demand.
###2659 Indeed, quite the reverse. When we were planning the launch of the iPod across Europe,
###2664 an important thing we had to manage with the iPod
###2666 was to make sure we kind of undersupplied the demand
###2670 so that we'd only roll it out
###2672 almost in response to cities crying out for those iPods to be available
###2677 and that's how we kept that kind of cachet for the iPod in its early years.
###2681 And we'd use extensive data research to understand
###2685 what the kind of relative strength of doing that in Rome versus Madrid would be.
###2690 Unlike most other MP3 players, which worked with either Macs or PCs,
###2695 the iPod needed Apple software running on an Apple computer.
###2699 For Steve Jobs, this closed system seemed to be a virtuous circle.
###2704 When they sell iPods at the beginning,
###2706 it locks you into the system,
###2707 and iPods have an immediate impact
###2712 on Apple Mac sales within the profitability of the corporation as a whole.
###2716 Ultimately, Jobs realised that Apple could make even more money by creating an iPod for Windows.
###2722 Steve knew that, for him to take Apple to another place,
###2728 he had to break out of the Mac ghetto,
###2730 which is his gated community of loyal fans who love the product.
###2735 Music became his way of reaching that larger audience.
###2740 ..is the new iPod. Apple was on a roll.
###2744 The iPod quickly became the number one digital music player in America and beyond.
###2751 You suddenly saw them everywhere,
###2753 and its success set the company on a new course.
###2758 There was no vision of there's going to be an iPod, then an iPhone, then an iPad.
###2763 However, there was a vision that we're going to be more consumer,
###2767 more of a consumer electronics company.
###2775 This is our store, and the store is divided into four parts.
###2780 The first quarter of the store has our home section...
###2784 Apple was on its way to becoming a global phenomenon.
###2788 Wanting to build a consumer electronics company,
###2790 the next step was to go into consumer electronics stores, Apple style,
###2795 with shops designed to match the products in them.
###2801 What's interesting about Apple's move into retail
###2805 is it wasn't so much Apple opening up a shop,
###2807 but rather Apple opening up its experience
###2810 and allowing people to buy Apple products in the kind of style,
###2814 in the kind of environment, that actually really suited that brand.
###2819 Every facet of the way the stores look was influenced by Steve Jobs.
###2823 He even held the American patent for the design of the glass stairs.
###2829 The fact that Steve Jobs was a sort of hippy control freak was an extraordinary collision,
###2835 but it's worked absolutely brilliantly for Apple,
###2838 which is you've got this impression of hippy chic and relaxed and everything else,
###2843 whereas actually this organisation is one of the most controlled organisations in the world.
###2849 Apple boasts some of the world's most profitable retail space,
###2853 but the shops are about far more than selling products.
###2856 An Apple Store is a temple to a belief system.
###2860 They conform to the structure of a religion.
###2864 They have the objects of veneration, the phone, the tablet,
###2868 they have a powerful priesthood.
###2870 They have a congregation of people who belong and who believe in Apple,
###2874 but ultimately they have the Messiah, the religious leader, the late Steve Jobs.
###2881 Apple's ethos, defined by that Think Different slogan,
###2886 turned out to be a remarkably valuable business philosophy.
###2889 It had helped the company reinvent computing and retailing,
###2893 and next it would take Apple to yet another revolutionary endeavour.
###2898 Steve Jobs was one of those people who recognised that, in the digital age, content would be key.
###2904 The iPod was designed to be a way to synchronise your music
###2907 from your computer to get it into your pocket.
###2911 It was after the success of the iPod that Apple said there's a market for us to sell music,
###2916 but that was not the original plan.
###2919 While Jobs needed music for the iPod,
###2923 the music industry had a problem of its own.
###2926 The rise of file-sharing websites like Napster was threatening the way the industry made money.
###2931 So you went from a world in which you had to go buy stuff in a store
###2937 to a world in which you had this cloud of music
###2940 that was, in effect, an unlimited source of free music,
###2945 which was a very threatening idea to the music industry.
###2949 Faced with this crisis, the record industry had tried to close Napster down
###2953 and sue people who downloaded music for free.
###2956 They were alarmed by Apple's iPod.
###2961 The record labels were very unhappy with that and felt that,
###2965 only because Napster was hard to use, could the music survive,
###2969 and here was Apple coming out with a digital music product
###2972 that was easy to use and was going to make it much more popular.
###2975 Even so, some in the music industry thought Apple might be able to help.
###2981 In 2002, a delegation of music executives travelled to Apple's headquarters
###2986 to present a vision for how they might collaborate.
###2989 Steve Jobs did not exactly warm to their ideas.
###2992 He listens, but he isn't listening patiently.
###2996 At one point he waves his arms and says, "Stop, stop, that's not why I'm here.
###3001 "I didn't come here to listen to you.
###3004 "I have my own views on what we need to do.
###3008 "You guys in the music business have had your heads up your asses all these years!"
###3012 Which made everybody on my side of the table mute, silent.
###3020 And I said, "Steve, that's exactly why we're here. We need your help."
###3025 Other technology companies had tried and failed to persuade the major labels
###3030 to license their music online, but Jobs was different.
###3034 Jobs was the biggest share owner in Disney.
###3037 Because he was in such a strong position as a Hollywood player
###3040 that he was able to bang the heads together of the music companies and say this is how it's going to be.
###3046 To Jobs, it was obvious the record labels didn't understand the new internet-savvy consumers.
###3052 He insisted the way to beat file-sharing was not to punish people for doing it
###3057 but to offer a more convenient reasonably-priced alternative.
###3062 In less than a year, every major label had signed up to the Apple iTunes store.
###3069 He just got the deal done and that was an incredible achievement.
###3072 That in pure business terms is deal-making,
###3074 which is a recognisable feature of your great tycoon.
###3078 In its first week, the iTunes store sold more than 1 million tracks.
###3084 It was so successful by the end of the first year,
###3087 the leverage had shifted from the owner of the content to Apple.
###3092 Some artists believe Apple now wields too much power through iTunes,
###3098 putting profits before musicians.
###3100 ..whose works it bleeds like a digital vampire for its enormous commission,
###3105 that it decides, you know, we'll take 30%.
###3109 It's a bit of a pity that everyone's online these days.
###3112 But you can't blame them. It's just the modern world, innit?
###3115 But what a business it is.
###3117 IPods give Apple power over the music industry through the connection to iTunes,
###3122 and, in turn, the appeal of iTunes boosts sales of iPods.
###3126 If I can fulfil all your needs, then I'll get all your money,
###3130 and that's Steve's approach.
###3133 He wanted to give people the devices they would use to consume video and audio,
###3139 then he wanted to give them video and audio to consume.
###3143 He's created the future of entertainment.
###3148 Jobs was usually very guarded about his private life,
###3151 but in 2005 he chose a very public stage, a speech to graduating students,
###3157 to reveal he had been battling serious illness.
###3161 About a year ago, I was diagnosed with cancer.
###3165 I had a scan at 7.30 in the morning
###3167 and it clearly showed a tumour on my pancreas.
###3170 My doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order,
###3175 which is doctor's code for "prepare to die".
###3178 It turned out to be a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that is curable with surgery.
###3184 I had the surgery and thankfully I'm fine now.
###3188 In reality, Jobs would continue his struggle with cancer for the next six years.
###3193 His diagnosis had a profound impact.
###3197 Death is very likely the single best invention of life.
###3201 It's life's change agent, it clears out the old to make way for the new.
###3206 Your time is limited so don't waste it living someone else's life.
###3211 It's a philosophy that Jobs himself followed.
###3215 It's really amazing in hindsight what he accomplished while he was sick.
###3221 Not only was he fighting this debilitating disease,
###3224 he was leading a huge corporation doing earth-shaking work
###3229 that affects hundreds of millions of people.
###3232 Steve Jobs' next major project would bring together everything he stood for,
###3237 a bold raid into a market into which the company had never been a player.
###3243 IPod. A phone.
###3246 CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
###3248 Are you getting it?
###3250 It would revolutionise the way a long-established industry worked, and make Apple billions.
###3257 And we're calling it... iPhone.
###3262 He said, "I think that we'll succeed in this marketplace
###3268 "because we're a software company,
###3270 "and everyone we're going to compete with are hardware companies."
###3274 I didn't realise at the time just how profound that was.
###3280 Apple's iPhone became the fastest selling handset on the market.
###3286 People weren't buying them just to make phone calls.
###3289 Steve, I love you!
###3291 What made the iPhone different was apps.
###3296 The iPhone was the gateway to a world of downloadable software
###3300 for anything from shopping to finding love, or lust, nearby.
###3305 He came into the marketplace and absolutely demonstrated to people
###3310 how you could package up bits of the internet and present it to people
###3315 in a way that was really simple and fast and digestible in the form of apps.
###3322 With apps, Apple had worked out how to open up its closed system
###3326 just enough to keep earning money from its latest iPods, iPhones and iPads,
###3331 even after you've bought them. The money keeps rolling in.
###3338 For the first time ever,
###3340 Apple briefly topped Exxon Mobil as the world's most valuable company.
###3344 All the more amazing as android phones and Dell and HP computers outsell Apple.
###3350 Oddly enough, the market share of Apple is very low.
###3352 It's incredibly low in computers but they make enormous profit out of it.
###3357 It's actually low in smartphones. It's not the leader in the world
###3361 by any means, yet the money they make make them the largest company on Earth.
###3365 Apple is much stronger than its competition,
###3368 and so they need to make sure they don't get complacent
###3375 because the way they'll lose some day is when someone quietly comes up behind them
###3381 and does something that is now better.
###3384 Over the course of more than three decades,
###3387 some might argue that Apple has travelled far from its origins,
###3391 as a bunch of Californians railing against IBM to become, itself, an all-powerful Big Brother.
###3398 But it is a more complicated and interesting story.
###3401 If Steve Jobs had just been a rebel, he wouldn't have got far,
###3405 but it's because he always had that inner-hippy
###3408 that Apple became so much more than just another computer company.
###3413 There was one aspect of Steve Jobs' battle with cancer he hadn't revealed.
###3417 He'd delayed having surgery for nine months after he was diagnosed.
###3421 Instead he'd tried alternative remedies
###3424 and a strict vegan diet, against the advice of those closest to him.
###3429 And the cancer had spread.
###3431 He was the kind of person that could convince himself of things
###3435 that weren't necessarily true, and that always worked with him for designing products,
###3440 where he could go to people and ask them to do something that they thought was impossible.
###3445 And I think he truly thought that,
###3449 through some unconventional means, he could cure himself.
###3455 A Californian suburb.
###3458 This was Steve Jobs' house after his death at the age of 56.
###3465 Home to no ordinary CEO, billionaire or hippie.
###3470 # Buckets or rain, buckets of tears
###3473 # Got all them buckets coming out of my ears
###3476 # Buckets of moonbeams in my hand... #
###3479 He wasn't an inventor, he wasn't a code writer,
###3482 he wasn't a designer, he wasn't a businessman really.
###3486 I mean the word people use is visionary.
###3488 If you break it down in the sense of he saw things,
###3492 in that sense he was a visionary. He just saw things.
###3496 As near as I can tell, Steve Jobs never left his counter-cultural frame of reference,
###3501 and so his way of staying forever young was to stay forever hippy.
###3506 Stay hungry, stay foolish. Thank you all very much.
