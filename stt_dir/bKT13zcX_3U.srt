1
0:0:5,168 --> 0:0:7,27
And now the
kung pao chicken.


2
0:0:7,27 --> 0:0:8,654
Ah, yeah.
Wow.


3
0:0:8,654 --> 0:0:10,73
Smooth.


4
0:0:10,73 --> 0:0:11,958
And finally,


5
0:0:11,958 --> 0:0:15,595
my moo shu pork.


6
0:0:15,595 --> 0:0:16,88
Whoo-hoo!


7
0:0:16,88 --> 0:0:18,631
Oh, there you have
it, gentlemen.


8
0:0:18,631 --> 0:0:22,802
Our entire dinner
unpacked by robot.


9
0:0:22,802 --> 0:0:26,139
And it only took 28 minutes.


10
0:0:26,139 --> 0:0:27,29
Impressive,


11
0:0:27,29 --> 0:0:29,659
but we must be cautious.
Why?


12
0:0:29,659 --> 0:0:32,645
Today, it's a Chinese food
retrieval robot.


13
0:0:32,645 --> 0:0:35,181
Tomorrow,
it travels back in time


14
0:0:35,181 --> 0:0:37,683
and tries to kill Sarah Connor.


15
0:0:37,683 --> 0:0:39,986
I don't think that's
going to happen, Sheldon.


16
0:0:39,986 --> 0:0:41,371
No one ever does.


17
0:0:41,371 --> 0:0:43,99
That's why it happens.


18
0:0:43,99 --> 0:0:45,708
Hey. Is the food here?


19
0:0:45,708 --> 0:0:47,1
Ooh. What's that?


20
0:0:47,1 --> 0:0:48,278
That, dear lady,


21
0:0:48,278 --> 0:0:50,93
is the Wolowitz
Programmable Hand,


22
0:0:50,93 --> 0:0:52,599
designed
for extravehicular repairs


23
0:0:52,599 --> 0:0:55,51
on the International
Space Station.


24
0:0:55,51 --> 0:0:56,636
Ah, cool.


25
0:0:56,636 --> 0:0:58,338
Ask me to pass the soy sauce.


26
0:0:58,338 --> 0:1:1,107
Oh, does that come up much
on the space station?


27
0:1:1,107 --> 0:1:4,544
Mostly with Asian
and Jewish astronauts.


28
0:1:4,544 --> 0:1:18,324
All right. Pass the soy sauce.
Coming up.


29
0:1:18,324 --> 0:1:19,943
So how's work?


30
0:1:19,943 --> 0:1:21,394
Oh, it's not bad.


31
0:1:21,394 --> 0:1:22,946
Kind of hungry.


32
0:1:22,946 --> 0:1:24,781
Yeah, we all are.


33
0:1:24,781 --> 0:1:26,583
Just wait.


34
0:1:26,583 --> 0:1:28,334
You realize, Penny,
that the technology


35
0:1:28,334 --> 0:1:30,486
that went into this arm
will one day make


36
0:1:30,486 --> 0:1:33,907
unskilled food servers
such as yourself obsolete.


37
0:1:33,907 --> 0:1:35,341
Really?


38
0:1:35,341 --> 0:1:39,529
They're going to make a robot
that spits on your hamburger?


39
0:1:39,529 --> 0:1:41,13
I thought you
broke up with her.


40
0:1:41,13 --> 0:1:43,783
Why is she here?


41
0:1:43,783 --> 0:1:45,118
Okay, here we go.


42
0:1:45,118 --> 0:1:49,22
Passing the soy sauce.


43
0:1:49,22 --> 0:1:53,776
Put out your hand.


44
0:1:53,776 --> 0:1:56,696
Oh!


45
0:1:56,696 --> 0:1:57,83
That's amazing.


46
0:1:57,83 --> 0:1:59,265
I wouldn't say amazing.


47
0:1:59,265 --> 0:2:1,267
At best,
it's a modest leap forward


48
0:2:1,267 --> 0:2:2,819
from the basic technology


49
0:2:2,819 --> 0:2:6,489
that gave us
Country Bear Jamboree.


50
0:2:6,489 --> 0:2:7,957
Hey, Sheldon?


51
0:2:7,957 --> 0:2:15,999
Yes?


52
0:2:15,999 --> 0:2:17,967
Peace?


53
0:2:17,967 --> 0:2:19,552
No, not peace.


54
0:2:19,552 --> 0:2:20,92
Hang on.
