###5 GRIME: The idea that I would create something that's going
###8 to elevate tattooing is pretty ridiculous.
###12 Because people are going to do what they're going to do.
###15 So I might be able to do a good tattoo now and then and
###18 somebody's going to get it.
###21 But there's still going to be a thousand other people lining
###23 up to get fucking really horrific tattoos.
###27 HENRY LEWIS: He's a well-rounded tattooer.
###30 You can tell he has like a background
###32 in traditional Americana.
###34 I think that's kind of like working with Hardy, where he
###36 got that from, and working with Aaron Cain and Marcus
###40 Pacheco, that biomechanical work that he does.
###44 I would say his style is definitely rooted in Japanese
###50 work from the Masters.
###51 He's taken notes from like Horioshi III, Filip Leu, and
###57 he's well-rounded in all these different facets of tattooing.
###61 He's coined the "Grime Style." And that's all taken from
###65 these educated styles of tattooing and mastering them
###68 and then flipping them.

###88 CIV: I like the unexpectedness of his work, where I'm a fan
###93 of all the black claw stuff, and the silhouette, and the
###95 really strong images.
###97 But then he'll just bust out some pain in the ass little
###100 single needle stuff just to show skill.
###104 I think anybody who has identifiable work, whether
###107 it's traditional, or Japanese, or just their own style,
###112 people are going to want to collect from you.
###114 I think tattooers took notice quicker than just fans.
###119 Because I think when you're in it, you can kind of see when
###122 something is special.
###124 CHRIS O'DONNELL: It just seemed like he had some other
###127 ideas in his head that he wanted to get out and not just
###129 emulate his favorite tattooers.
###130 
###134 Grime started doing lots of eyeballs with fire.
###139 -Is this the kind of fire that people would copy from him?
###141 CHRIS O'DONNELL: The second he started doing this kind of
###143 stuff with this signature fire, it was horrible how many
###147 people were ripping him off.
###149 Everybody started doing that.
###150 It was so obvious what they were looking at when they
###153 would draw a tattoo.
###154 GRIME: I did some strange style of fire for a little
###157 while that people definitely borrowed some of that stuff.
###161 But the thing is, it wasn't that good what they borrowed.
###165 I thought they borrowed it, whatever.
###168 But it wasn't that good.
###169 I would never tattoo that flame now.
###171 I guess it just made me maybe frustrated, but it also made
###174 me just try to be even more creative, try to make me push
###182 my work in a way which wouldn't be able to be copied
###186 in a way that would make it look like I did it.
###189 I think my work, for the most part, is too specific for the
###194 client, I think, to be taken and just pieced together in
###199 another way and then look like a straight rip-off of me.
###202 CHRIS O'DONNELL: That's part of what makes Grime Grime is
###204 that he doesn't want his tattoos to look
###207 like anybody else's.
###208 He wants to express himself, desperately express himself
###212 through what he's creating.
###214 And why not?
###214 That's what he's here for.
###216 But it also spills over in ideas like I guess I'm going
###220 to submit work to that person for that book they're
###222 publishing.
###223 And he'd be like, I'm just going to publish my own book.
###226 Why wouldn't I just publish my own book?
###227 Why do that?
###229 That's how he thinks.
###230 He's like, why don't I just create it myself?
###234 When he used to live with me in Richmond, I would go to
###236 sleep 1 o'clock, 2 o'clock in the morning.
###239 And he'd stay up all night with headphones on and tons of
###243 tracing paper, just really aggressively drawing all
###247 night, and then he would be up before me.
###250 That definitely made me feel a little lazy, having him on my
###253 couch doing that every night.
###255 This is a picture of Grime working on his sketchbook, or
###259 journal that eventually turned into "Two Year Autopsy." He
###262 had a brand new sketchbook that I think Chris Duncan had
###264 given him for an art show.
###266 And the idea was a year would go by and him and a bunch of
###268 different people would fill up their own sketchbooks.
###270 He would do caricatures of himself.
###272 He would do collage.
###274 He would write.
###276 He would put anything that he was working on.
###278 It was like a diary, a visual diary.
###282 He was traveling a lot, too.
###283 We would go to conventions in Europe.
###285 We did Tin-Tin's Convention two years in a row in Paris.
###290 That was great, because we would go with enough time to
###292 explore the city.
###294 There's a couple days in Paris where he would go out by
###296 himself with his camera and just do
###298 self-portraits with a timer.
###300 He wasn't just tattooing.
###302 Everything was an art project at that point because he
###304 wanted to use material for the book.
###307 I like reading about what he's thinking.
###310 GRIME: Yeah, on one hand, I like to stay fairly private,
###312 but it is a little cathartic.
###314 But it also is like aiming in two ways.
###316 I put it out there as an exercise, but I also--
###320 the writing itself is an exercise for me.
###323 I enjoy writing.
###324 The words I choose and how I express the thought and the
###328 feeling, it's rewarding.
###329 It's real.
###330 I like it.
###331 CIV: When Grime did the book "Two Year Autopsy," it was
###333 like two years on the road of tattooing, but mostly two
###338 years of torturing himself over predominantly women,
###345 which everyone enjoys doing.
###348 -Do you feel like a lot of people come and try to speak
###350 to you about some things that are more personal?
###353 GRIME: No.
###354 I don't think people-- no, most people don't.
###356 Maybe they just don't feel comfortable doing it.
###360 Maybe they just feel uncomfortable going,
###362 so like, hey, so--
###363 
###366 I read about that one part where you're
###369 spilling your guts.
###371 Should we talk about it while you're tattooing me?
###373 Yeah, I think most people probably have a lot more tact
###375 than that, in some ways, you know.
###377 
###381 CIV: He sent it to a psychologist to read and then
###386 critique it.
###387 And the psychologist said something like--
###389 I'm paraphrasing, but it said something like this is the
###391 most self-righteous bunch of masturbation and pompous blah,
###397 blah, blah, just crushed it.
###399 And he was so excited that he got this horrible review from
###403 a psychologist about it.
###405 "Two Year Autopsy," I think, is an example of travel,
###409 torture, hard work pays off.
###412 It seems the more frustrated and tortured he is, the work
###416 gets better.
###418 YUTARO SAKAI: We all do, but he's almost like chipping away
###421 his life to make it.
###424 I think that people, whoever has his tattoos, they have a
###428 piece of his life.
###431 Being this type of tattoo artist, like fully custom
###435 every day, I think it's a really stressful life.
###439 GRIME: Oh my God.
###442 Fucking people.
###443 YUTARO SAKAI: He's definitely kind of a
###445 celebrity of tattooing.
###447 And he seems to not have much of his personal time
###451 sometimes, and it's hard for some people.
###455 CHRIS O'DONNELL: I don't know if I've seen Grime get burnt
###459 out or in a burnout phase tattooing.
###462 But he always kind of seems like he
###465 was up too late drawing.
###467 You know what I mean?
###467 Like he always just seems a little tired or preoccupied.
###471 He looks like he's always stressing about whatever
###474 project he's working on.
###476 GRIME: Some of it's my ego, I think, not wanting to say no
###482 to a project or a thing that I know that I can do
###485 or I'd like to try.
###488 Although I've obviously learned how to say no over the
###492 years, and I'm better at it as time passes, but there are
###496 still some things that I think maybe get out of my control,
###501 and that creates difficulties for me.
###502 Dude, that's shit.
###504 Conventions suck.
###505 I just want to go and make maybe a
###506 couple tattoos or something.
###508 Now it's like a whole fucking thing.
###510 
###514 GRIME: It's my job.
###515 
###520 GRIME: No, there's no fun.
###521 I work every day on there.
###522 There's nothing to do but work.
###524 That's it.
###525 
###529 GRIME: What if I didn't feel like it's just all pressure
###531 and it's all everything is everyone wanting
###534 something from me.
###535 
###538 GRIME: I know.
###539 HENRY LEWIS: The man's always working on something, I can
###542 say that much.
###543 There's always some iron in the fire.
###545 
###548 Which is amazing, too, because it kind of
###550 keeps me on the ball.
###553 And it just keeps me wanting to produce and create.
###556 And like I said, art for the sake of art.
###558 GRIME: Maybe a little bit ego, just wanting to say I'm here.
###562 Some kind of base--
###565 somewhat of a base artistic kind of bend, which
###568 is, like, I'm here.
###571 This is my mark I've left kind of thing.
###574 There's something about that.
###576 
###581 -These are all the paintings that are in the--
###583 GRIME: Yeah, my "Two Year Autopsy."
###586 -Let's see them back here.
###588 GRIME: I'm just pissed off all night.
###592 I don't feel like I'm an artist right now.
###594 I have in the past.
###596 I don't feel like I've been creating lately.
###598 So it makes me feel less accomplished as an artist.
###604 -Do you have any concepts started or--
###608 GRIME: They're in my head, dude.
###610 What do I need to do?
###611 Either you do it or you don't, yeah.
###616 There's not a thing that I want to do.
###617 I just feel like I get ideas for things I want to do.
###621 And then I'm like, OK, I'll fuckin'--
###624 I'll write them down or I'll have an idea about it and get
###626 some stuff.
###626 And I want to do other shit.
###628 Do I want to do a fucking watercolor of
###630 a traditional tat.
###631 Fuck that, you know?
###633 I want to do shit that's in my brain.
###635 I want to do cathartic work.
###636 Because to me, that's what art is.
###642 It's the expression of yourself and
###644 your point of view.
###645 If you don't have a point of view, what the fuck you got?
###646 
###648 And I think that's what makes people drawn to art, is they
###653 feel the person's emotion or personality come through.
###658 
###661 GRIME: No.
###662 Don't remind me.
###663 I think I'm going to do that soon.
###666 I need to.
###667 I need it.
###670 I have responsibilities though.
###671 I have two dogs.
###672 I can't just go fuck off.
###675 They're human.
###677 Jones, motherfucker.
###679 Right?
###680 Owww!
###682 Hey, whose head's that?
###684 
###687 And you know, I think we change as people.
###689 I change as a person as I age.
###692 And so I seek different things.
###694 And maybe things become more difficult than they were when
###696 I was younger.
###697 Or maybe I just get tired of them.
###699 Or maybe I have more work than I ever have had.
###703 Maybe it's a combination of all those things.
###705 
###709 Jones!
###710 Mr. Jones!
###711 Come!
###712 Get your ass down here!
###714 Leave it!
###717 Ah, all right, what am I standing here for?
###719 -Because we are walking up here.
###721 I guess this is where you bring your dogs a lot, huh?
###722 GRIME: Yeah, sometimes.
###725 Did you get that?
###727 Me and the dog drinking at the same time?
###728 -Uh-huh.
###728 GRIME: OK, good.
###730 What kind of soundtrack are we doing for this thing?
###733 -What kind of what?
###734 GRIME: Soundtrack we doing for this thing?
