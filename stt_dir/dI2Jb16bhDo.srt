teaching pocket the aliens

0:0:5,42 --> 0:0:10,239
that the public don't yet know about


3
0:0:10,239 --> 0:0:11,969
one example

0:0:11,969 --> 0:0:14,869
america's own space fighter

0:0:22,439 --> 0:0:26,369
this military meeting space shuttle
could possibly be recognized in center


8
0:0:26,369 --> 0:0:29,159
gets the invader


9
0:0:29,159 --> 0:0:32,78
but america's small space force must
fight


10
0:0:32,78 --> 0:0:38,23
an armada


11
0:0:38,23 --> 0:0:44,77
workable experimental weapons exist in
lansing cases across the country


12
0:0:44,77 --> 0:0:48,3
military leases


13
0:0:48,3 --> 0:0:50,7
team weapons


14
0:0:50,7 --> 0:0:57,96
literal regards


15
0:0:57,96 --> 0:1:2,52
dr travis taylor has investigated one of
the most viewers and weapons of all


16
0:1:2,52 --> 0:1:3,5
there


17
0:1:3,5 --> 0:1:5,42
a real gone


18
0:1:5,42 --> 0:1:9,45
it's been called the most powerful going
in the world

0:1:9,45 --> 0:1:14,2
super magnets accelerator projectile
along twenty with allison to


20
0:1:14,2 --> 0:1:17,29
unimaginable speeds


21
0:1:17,29 --> 0:1:18,36
meaning of the house


22
0:1:18,36 --> 0:1:20,64
thousands and thousands of miles per
hour


23
0:1:20,64 --> 0:1:23,4
with the projectile whereas a missile


24
0:1:23,4 --> 0:1:27,29
you're limited to hypersonic velocities
it's a with three thousand miles per


25
0:1:27,29 --> 0:1:30,34
hour


26
0:1:30,34 --> 0:1:34,34
do you know maybe ten times faster kisi
with modern technology


27
0:1:34,34 --> 0:1:40,68
the generals ordered unproven weapon
bolted onto a truck bed


28
0:1:40,68 --> 0:1:47,9
as the rust into combat


29
0:1:47,9 --> 0:1:57,67
here


30
0:1:57,67 --> 0:1:58,53
but the expiry


31
0:1:58,53 --> 0:2:13,639
metallum weapons are no match for for a
technology that crossed the cosmos


32
0:2:13,639 --> 0:2:16,179
and even if it isn't


33
0:2:16,179 --> 0:2:23,449
there is no time to mass produce new
weapons five


34
0:2:23,449 --> 0:2:26,409
if our planet stands a chance


35
0:2:26,409 --> 0:2:30,719
the nations of growth must merge their
competing military central one


36
0:2:30,719 --> 0:2:33,49
global army


37
0:2:33,49 --> 0:2:46,909
park humanity


38
0:2:46,909 --> 0:2:51,709
in the face of empyrean invasion


39
0:2:51,709 --> 0:2:56,79
can the nations of birth


40
0:2:56,79 --> 0:2:57,619
unite


41
0:2:57,619 --> 0:2:59,279
r_r_

0:2:59,279 --> 0:3:4,799
president reagan one state's beach where
he said to the united nations macy's you


43
0:3:4,799 --> 0:3:8,789
may think about quickly our differences
worldwide


44
0:3:8,789 --> 0:3:12,29
would finish if we were stationed in the
a m trade


45
0:3:12,29 --> 0:3:17,259
from outside this work


46
0:3:17,259 --> 0:3:22,799
our former enemies now become our allies


47
0:3:22,799 --> 0:3:24,979
millions to sell it and i think


48
0:3:24,979 --> 0:3:28,989
with us on the cell something shoulder
to shoulder with the taliban surviving


49
0:3:28,989 --> 0:3:30,699
allies


50
0:3:30,699 --> 0:3:32,699
interest darkest hour


51
0:3:32,699 --> 0:3:34,59
the nations of the world


52
0:3:34,59 --> 0:3:37,29
combine forces


53
0:3:37,29 --> 0:3:37,729
the warrior


54
0:3:37,729 --> 0:3:47,429
indeed of our entire species acts f


55
0:3:47,429 --> 0:3:49,779
but that's partly sunny


56
0:3:49,779 --> 0:3:54,879
for technology that can travel between
the stars


57
0:3:54,879 --> 0:3:56,89
the defense organizations of the world


58
0:3:56,89 --> 0:3:58,349
their realized there


59
0:3:58,349 --> 0:4:6,779
multibillion dollar assets are not
working


60
0:4:6,779 --> 0:4:10,239
their technology is so far superior to
ours


61
0:4:10,239 --> 0:4:10,89
that hard


62
0:4:10,89 --> 0:4:14,439
don't last long


63
0:4:14,439 --> 0:4:15,769
now


64
0:4:15,769 --> 0:4:22,36
deletes focus their attacks


65
0:4:22,36 --> 0:4:25,689
fungus and some kind of a mission down
to the era surface


66
0:4:25,689 --> 0:4:30,259
anything with madonna threat of
admission because the next priority


67
0:4:30,259 --> 0:4:36,56
the lead air force clears the skies the


68
0:4:36,56 --> 0:4:44,449
then blasts military targets around the
country


69
0:4:44,449 --> 0:4:49,189
successfully located military targets is
simple


70
0:4:49,189 --> 0:4:55,269
began in the fall of sorrow radar
signals


71
0:4:55,269 --> 0:4:58,19
generator system urinating a radar polls


72
0:4:58,19 --> 0:5:0,8
and that's something that we tracked


73
0:5:0,8 --> 0:5:2,98
if you're dealing with the civilization
that's


74
0:5:2,98 --> 0:5:6,9
capable of space travel you may not want
to call your attention


75
0:5:6,9 --> 0:5:10,63
and their weaponry down upon your like a
reminder area you know that's one of us


76
0:5:10,63 --> 0:5:15,979
detection systems or data


77
0:5:15,979 --> 0:5:21,779
dvb-t craft seagull military
installations around


78
0:5:21,779 --> 0:5:22,749
takeout


79
0:5:22,749 --> 0:5:26,65
offer made a comment units over all the
government's armies of the world


80
0:5:26,65 --> 0:5:29,389
uh... that's gonna happen very quickly
it may happen in in a matter of minutes


81
0:5:29,389 --> 0:5:38,129
might take a few days but it's gonna be
very quick


82
0:5:38,129 --> 0:5:42,979
didn't want to attack the infrastructure
of our society


83
0:5:42,979 --> 0:5:45,87
the backbone of human civilization
itself


84
0:5:45,87 --> 0:5:47,29
become so simple


85
0:5:47,29 --> 0:5:49,49
undefended target


86
0:5:49,49 --> 0:5:53,129
they're gonna try to get things that we
would use to resist right


87
0:5:53,129 --> 0:5:56,55
that's why we put the bright spots on
the map to start taking them out


88
0:5:56,55 --> 0:5:57,909
we got our power


89
0:5:57,909 --> 0:6:1,8
have any power to do that


90
0:6:1,8 --> 0:6:6,39
and so it is all over this battlefield
earth no


91
0:6:6,39 --> 0:6:9,349
military units obliterated


92
0:6:9,349 --> 0:6:12,13
cds ruined


93
0:6:12,13 --> 0:6:15,489
infrastructural emanated


94
0:6:15,489 --> 0:6:16,769
humanity


95
0:6:16,769 --> 0:6:29,729
defeated


96
0:6:29,729 --> 0:6:34,56
somewhere in the united states inside an
underground bunker


97
0:6:34,56 --> 0:6:36,41
the leader of the fleetwood


98
0:6:36,41 --> 0:6:42,77
always his nation's options


99
0:6:42,77 --> 0:6:48,199
the plan to fight it gillian invasion
includes one remaining possibility


100
0:6:48,199 --> 0:6:51,21
within devastatingly precautions


101
0:6:51,21 --> 0:6:52,61
somebody have to tell


102
0:6:52,61 --> 0:6:53,43
the president


103
0:6:53,43 --> 0:6:59,12
mr president we think the nuclear option
you know one thing


104
0:6:59,12 --> 0:7:1,27
nuclear weapons


105
0:7:1,27 --> 0:7:5,669
the most powerful armaments ever
conceived on this planet


106
0:7:5,669 --> 0:7:10,65
there are over twenty two thousand
active nuclear warheads on earth


107
0:7:10,65 --> 0:7:15,199
the combined destruction could wipe out
the entire human species


108
0:7:15,199 --> 0:7:18,789
twice over


109
0:7:18,789 --> 0:7:23,63
this may be the only effective option
against the invaders


110
0:7:23,63 --> 0:7:29,669
credit cards entered terrifying cost


111
0:7:29,669 --> 0:7:36,619
who would killed millions of citizens
inning campbell to destroy the enemy


112
0:7:36,619 --> 0:7:38,11
in america


113
0:7:38,11 --> 0:7:44,129
only the president has the authority to
make that kind of decision


114
0:7:44,129 --> 0:7:45,33
but i think you'd be very


115
0:7:45,33 --> 0:7:49,579
remorse for regretful and it wouldn't
undertake that decision lightly


116
0:7:49,579 --> 0:7:52,509
but at the end of the day i think you
decide that that was the right thing to


117
0:7:52,509 --> 0:7:56,579
do


118
0:7:56,579 --> 0:7:59,99
the president called principally case


119
0:7:59,99 --> 0:8:2,569
the nuclear football


120
0:8:2,569 --> 0:8:10,569
the portable launch codes for america's
arsenal


121
0:8:10,569 --> 0:8:14,419
the first started our nation's capital


122
0:8:14,419 --> 0:8:17,579
they've won ship is destroyed


123
0:8:17,579 --> 0:8:20,749
it may cause the others to retreat


124
0:8:20,749 --> 0:8:23,949
it's a demonstration of our destructive
power


125
0:8:23,949 --> 0:8:27,309
and our resolve


126
0:8:27,309 --> 0:8:29,15
was a decision from eight minutes


127
0:8:29,15 --> 0:8:31,799
was the most effective way to use


128
0:8:31,799 --> 0:8:35,81
so uh... my first prev be dropped bombs
on top of the vehicle


129
0:8:35,81 --> 0:8:39,69
so that they at least the the spacecraft
with source you went below


130
0:8:39,69 --> 0:8:41,7
store up from fallout


131
0:8:41,7 --> 0:8:47,1
you would minimize the blast


132
0:8:47,1 --> 0:8:53,16
land-based nuclear missiles are already
destroyed


133
0:8:53,16 --> 0:9:0,16
but there is another delivery system
that may be on skates


134
0:9:0,16 --> 0:9:3,41
you don't know where the submarines are
any given time


135
0:9:3,41 --> 0:9:6,29
and so uh... the submarine has the
advantage that


136
0:9:6,29 --> 0:9:9,99
in theory at least the concert this fire
ballistic missiles quickly submerge


137
0:9:9,99 --> 0:9:11,58
again


138
0:9:11,58 --> 0:9:13,48
disappear before the enemy as any


139
0:9:13,48 --> 0:9:19,75
ability to really responded back


140
0:9:19,75 --> 0:9:20,87
board


141
0:9:20,87 --> 0:9:25,24
somewhere in the atlantic ocean


142
0:9:25,24 --> 0:9:29,28
are suddenly rises from the depths


143
0:9:29,28 --> 0:9:32,35
one hundred fifty feet below the surface


144
0:9:32,35 --> 0:9:35,5
a patch opens


145
0:9:35,5 --> 0:9:37,209
i've tried and true ballistic missile


146
0:9:37,209 --> 0:9:38,93
bursts through this service


147
0:9:38,93 --> 0:9:44,12
and takes place


148
0:9:44,12 --> 0:9:49,21
it carries nearly three point lead
megatons of destructive power


149
0:9:49,21 --> 0:9:55,0
two hundred fifty times the size of the
perot shimla blast


150
0:9:55,0 --> 0:9:57,59
as its source toward its targets


151
0:9:57,59 --> 0:10:1,6
the missiles to detections


152
0:10:1,6 --> 0:10:6,9
breaks apart into the key warhead


153
0:10:6,9 --> 0:10:11,88
these warheads are self-guided and not
dependent on satellites


154
0:10:11,88 --> 0:10:16,37
the nuclear warheads dark toward the
alien vessel hanging over washington


155

160
0:10:51,37 --> 0:10:53,67
into with regard to the future


161
0:10:53,67 --> 0:11:7,32
puffery over our nation's capital


162
0:11:7,32 --> 0:11:13,5
it is the most destructive military
attacking history


163
0:11:13,5 --> 0:11:18,22
four miles of ground zero flap


164
0:11:18,22 --> 0:11:20,3
we've been downtown d_c_


165
0:11:20,3 --> 0:11:26,88
ninety eight percent of the population


166
0:11:26,88 --> 0:11:37,72
but will it work


167
0:11:37,72 --> 0:11:43,56
earth's mightiest weapon has had no
impact


168
0:11:43,56 --> 0:11:46,51
the recent is simple


169
0:11:46,51 --> 0:11:48,65
travel between the stars


170
0:11:48,65 --> 0:11:52,62
requires protection


171
0:11:52,62 --> 0:11:56,75
if they have the technology to get from
their star system to hear they have to


172
0:11:56,75 --> 0:11:58,9
have a higher so metallurgy


173
0:11:58,9 --> 0:12:2,49
or they might have sealed like in
science fiction


174
0:12:2,49 --> 0:12:6,4
if u but really really really fast
spaceship


175
0:12:6,4 --> 0:12:9,17
and michael meteorite size of the desk
that gives you


176
0:12:9,17 --> 0:12:11,94
at a park a lot of anything spacecraft


177
0:12:11,94 --> 0:12:15,48
this many times the largest nuclear
weapon ever built by man cac


178
0:12:15,48 --> 0:12:16,97
so that they had shields


179
0:12:16,97 --> 0:12:19,4
they can withstand a nuclear weapon


180
0:12:19,4 --> 0:12:22,56
and how we're gonna do it may be scratch
their fate but we destroyed all city in


181
0:12:22,56 --> 0:12:25,3
the process


182
0:12:25,3 --> 0:12:29,8
our nation's capital which is destroyed


183
0:12:29,8 --> 0:12:33,12
births armies are devastated


184
0:12:33,12 --> 0:12:39,21
but in the secret plans for t_v_ in
indonesia the war isn't over


185
0:12:39,21 --> 0:12:44,71
descr the beginning


186
0:12:44,71 --> 0:12:49,4
from shielded bunkers in secret
locations to survive in the military


187
0:12:49,4 --> 0:12:54,13
leaders issue orders for a surprising
new tactic


188
0:12:54,13 --> 0:12:56,8
instead of attack


189
0:12:56,8 --> 0:12:59,57
the ordered their forces to do the
opposite


190
0:12:59,57 --> 0:13:3,35
runaway


191
0:13:3,35 --> 0:13:5,51
very possible that the order because


192
0:13:5,51 --> 0:13:9,84
get out of the city's and disperse
yourself as much as possible


193
0:13:9,84 --> 0:13:16,0
it's preferable to entirely from
extinction extermination of human rights


194
0:13:16,0 --> 0:13:19,0
idealistic and i think the best you can


195
0:13:19,0 --> 0:13:23,37
do not present liable for gifts


196
0:13:23,37 --> 0:13:26,19
military should be afforded to disperse


197
0:13:26,19 --> 0:13:31,19
katie weapon take iraq take three days
worth of food and


198
0:13:31,19 --> 0:13:34,76
winter where you can just go


199
0:13:34,76 --> 0:13:37,27
it's time to move on


200
0:13:37,27 --> 0:14:9,23
to fight another day


201
0:14:9,23 --> 0:14:10,61
firsts remaining committee


202
0:14:10,61 --> 0:14:14,3
