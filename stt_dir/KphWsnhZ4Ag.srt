1
0:0:13,326 --> 0:0:17,485
The entire money-structured
and materialistic-oriented society


2
0:0:17,485 --> 0:0:19,321
is a false society.


3
0:0:19,321 --> 0:0:23,543
Our society will go down in history
as the lowest development in man.


4
0:0:23,543 --> 0:0:26,957
We have the brains, the know-how,
the technology


5
0:0:26,957 --> 0:0:46,597
and the feasibility
to build an entirely new civilization.


6
0:0:46,597 --> 0:0:52,57
(Jacque Fresco)
It was living through
the 1929 Great Depression


7
0:0:52,57 --> 0:0:56,503
that helped shape
my social conscience.


8
0:0:56,503 --> 0:1:1,13
During this time, I realized
the Earth was still the same place:


9
0:1:1,13 --> 0:1:6,424
manufacturing plants were still intact
and resources were still there


10
0:1:6,424 --> 0:1:11,737
but people didn't have the money
to buy the products.


11
0:1:11,737 --> 0:1:15,315
I felt that the rules of the game
we play by


12
0:1:15,315 --> 0:1:19,821
were obsolete and insufficient.


13
0:1:19,821 --> 0:1:25,684
Misery, suffering and war
provided the incentive for my life's work.


14
0:1:25,684 --> 0:1:31,21
I was also motivated by
the seeming incompetence of governments


15
0:1:31,21 --> 0:1:37,113
the academic world, and the lack of solutions
offered by scientists.


16
0:1:37,113 --> 0:1:40,878
I realized that instead of working
with individuals


17
0:1:40,878 --> 0:1:47,158
a more effective method would be
to redesign the culture.


18
0:1:47,158 --> 0:1:51,664
This began a lifelong quest
to finding solutions


19
0:1:51,664 --> 0:2:1,985
to the many problems
that we have today.


20
0:2:1,985 --> 0:2:6,16
(Narrator)
This presentation
is a feasible plan for social change


21
0:2:6,16 --> 0:2:10,811
that works toward a peaceful
and sustainable global civilization


22
0:2:10,811 --> 0:2:17,769
where human beings,
technology and nature coexist.


23
0:2:17,769 --> 0:2:21,319
It outlines an alternative
to strive for


24
0:2:21,319 --> 0:2:25,156
where human rights
are not only paper proclamations


25
0:2:25,156 --> 0:2:31,44
but a way of life.


26
0:2:31,44 --> 0:2:39,804
It is called The Venus Project.


27
0:2:39,804 --> 0:2:42,563
Its founder, Jacque Fresco


28
0:2:42,563 --> 0:2:46,939
calls for a straightforward redesign
of the culture in which war


29
0:2:46,939 --> 0:2:51,84
poverty, hunger, debt
and unnecessary human suffering


30
0:2:51,84 --> 0:2:58,203
are viewed not only as avoidable
but totally unacceptable.


31
0:2:58,203 --> 0:3:1,947
It is becoming increasingly obvious
that anything less


32
0:3:1,947 --> 0:3:21,972
will simply result in a continuation
of the same problems we face today.


33
0:3:21,972 --> 0:3:25,2
The Venus Project's research center


34
0:3:25,2 --> 0:3:28,825
constructed by Fresco and Roxanne Meadows


35
0:3:28,825 --> 0:3:32,265
is located in Venus, Florida.


36
0:3:32,265 --> 0:3:36,73
It addresses many of the root causes
of our difficulties.


37
0:3:36,73 --> 0:3:51,271
But what are the real origins
of our problems?


38
0:3:51,271 --> 0:3:55,178
At present, we are left
with very few alternatives


39
0:3:55,178 --> 0:4:1,153
since we are on a collision course
of our own making.


40
0:4:1,153 --> 0:4:7,238
Answers from yesterday
are no longer relevant.


41
0:4:7,238 --> 0:4:10,507
Considering the damage already done
to the environment


42
0:4:10,507 --> 0:4:14,359
we are rapidly approaching
a point of no return


43
0:4:14,359 --> 0:4:18,62
where nature will dictate the course.


44
0:4:18,62 --> 0:4:20,893
Either we continue as we have


45
0:4:20,893 --> 0:4:24,634
with outmoded social customs
and habits of thought


46
0:4:24,634 --> 0:4:27,66
thereby threatening our future


47
0:4:27,66 --> 0:4:31,649
or, we apply
a more appropriate set of values


48
0:4:31,649 --> 0:4:34,444
relevant to a sustainable society


49
0:4:34,444 --> 0:4:40,339
with more opportunity and freedoms.


50
0:4:40,339 --> 0:4:43,919
Americans have been conditioned
in their kind of society


51
0:4:43,919 --> 0:4:46,75
to get a different kind of car next year


52
0:4:46,75 --> 0:4:48,581
to buy a new television set,
or a tape recorder.


53
0:4:48,581 --> 0:4:53,122
We are radical as hell but our political
and social institutions


54
0:4:53,122 --> 0:4:56,25
have not changed
and this is where we are stagnating:


55
0:4:56,25 --> 0:5:1,791
because we always equate any new idea
with communism or regimentation


56
0:5:1,791 --> 0:5:5,306
because we have been brought up
to fear that which is new.


57
0:5:5,306 --> 0:5:8,99
(Narrator)
None of the world's economic systems:


58
0:5:8,99 --> 0:5:13,985
socialism, communism, fascism
or the free enterprise system


59
0:5:13,985 --> 0:5:19,468
have eliminated the problems of elitism,
nationalism, racism


60
0:5:19,468 --> 0:5:24,828
and most of all, scarcity.


61
0:5:24,828 --> 0:5:29,611
These are all based primarily
on economic disparity.


62
0:5:29,611 --> 0:5:33,641
When money is used to regulate
and distribute resources for profit


63
0:5:33,641 --> 0:5:36,556
and people and nations
are out for themselves


64
0:5:36,556 --> 0:5:39,198
they will seek advantage at any cost.


65
0:5:39,198 --> 0:5:42,738
They do this by maintaining
a competitive edge


66
0:5:42,738 --> 0:5:46,812
or through military intervention.


67
0:5:46,812 --> 0:5:52,929
War represents the supreme failure of nations
to resolve their differences.


68
0:5:52,929 --> 0:5:55,373
From a strictly pragmatic standpoint


69
0:5:55,373 --> 0:6:1,392
it is the most inefficient waste of lives
and resources ever conceived.


70
0:6:1,392 --> 0:6:5,212
Most wars
are for the control of resources


71
0:6:5,212 --> 0:6:8,916
and maintaining your position
of differential advantage.


72
0:6:8,916 --> 0:6:11,73
They're not based on
the 'dignity of man.'


73
0:6:11,73 --> 0:6:14,692
They're not based on
elevating human beings.


74
0:6:14,692 --> 0:6:18,654
It might elevate the human beings
in the country that's the victor.


75
0:6:18,654 --> 0:6:22,241
It might do that.
But as far as the rest of the world goes


76
0:6:22,241 --> 0:6:25,574
the price is enormous.


77
0:6:25,574 --> 0:6:29,566
(Narrator)
This crude and violent attempt
to resolve international differences


78
0:6:29,566 --> 0:6:32,597
takes on even more ominous overtones


79
0:6:32,597 --> 0:6:36,427
with the advent
of computerized nuclear delivery systems


80
0:6:36,427 --> 0:6:45,25
and deadly biological
and chemical weapons.


81
0:6:45,25 --> 0:6:48,71
Yet it is a windfall,
money-making opportunity


82
0:6:48,71 --> 0:6:54,123
for those who profit
by the military-industrial complex.


83
0:6:54,123 --> 0:6:56,638
If the profit were taken out of wars


84
0:6:56,638 --> 0:7:0,217
do you really believe
we would have them?


85
0:7:0,217 --> 0:7:3,774
(Jacque Fresco)
If they draft you
into the army to serve this country


86
0:7:3,774 --> 0:7:6,344
(you put up your life
for this country)


87
0:7:6,344 --> 0:7:9,131
they should draft
all the war industries:


88
0:7:9,131 --> 0:7:12,235
every cannon maker,
machine gun maker


89
0:7:12,235 --> 0:7:15,265
automobiles, jeeps,
warships


90
0:7:15,265 --> 0:7:21,156
all drafted,
so they're on the same basis of pay as the army.


91
0:7:21,156 --> 0:7:24,548
Then it's real.
But if you make millions selling warships


92
0:7:24,548 --> 0:7:28,1
and machine guns to the army,
then it's corrupt.


93
0:7:28,1 --> 0:7:33,178
I would (if I had my way),
if we had millions of men in the army


94
0:7:33,178 --> 0:7:36,758
I'd send them to school
to become problem solvers


95
0:7:36,758 --> 0:7:41,645
how to get along with other nations.
That's what we have to do, not kill.


96
0:7:41,645 --> 0:7:49,81
Soldiers are just killing machines;
they're trained to kill.


97
0:7:49,81 --> 0:7:53,835
I would train them to be able to go to Mexico
and bridge the difference


98
0:7:53,835 --> 0:7:57,512
and go to the Arab world
and see if they can bridge the difference.


99
0:7:57,512 --> 0:8:2,748
So bring them all together,
all the nations.


100
0:8:2,748 --> 0:8:7,573
(Narrator)
War is not the only form of violence
imposed upon people.


101
0:8:7,573 --> 0:8:11,67
There is also hunger, poverty


102
0:8:11,67 --> 0:8:15,436
homelessness and unemployment.


103
0:8:15,436 --> 0:8:20,866
The acceptance of these conditions
as expressive of 'human nature' is a myth


104
0:8:20,866 --> 0:8:29,604
used to keep things as they are.


105
0:8:29,604 --> 0:8:35,58
Genetics has nothing to do with greed,
business, race prejudice.


106
0:8:35,58 --> 0:8:40,391
All of the operant systems in any society
are part of your education


107
0:8:40,391 --> 0:8:44,953
the books you read, the role models you follow
and the people you admire.


108
0:8:44,953 --> 0:8:48,153
The genes have nothing to do...


109
0:8:48,153 --> 0:8:51,96
except with the color of your eyes,
the shape of your nose


110
0:8:51,96 --> 0:8:56,734
perhaps inherited features.


111
0:8:56,734 --> 0:9:4,5
The genes do not control values.


112
0:9:4,5 --> 0:9:8,405
Even if you're born with a much better brain
than another person


113
0:9:8,405 --> 0:9:12,704
meaning better receptors,
the quality of the tissue is better


114
0:9:12,704 --> 0:9:15,808
I would say that
if you have a better brain


115
0:9:15,808 --> 0:9:20,879
and you live in a fascist country
you become a fascist faster.


116
0:9:20,879 --> 0:9:24,716
The brain
has no mechanism of discrimination.


117
0:9:24,716 --> 0:9:29,215
The brain can't tell you
what is relevant or less relevant


118
0:9:29,215 --> 0:9:34,655
except experience.


119
0:9:34,655 --> 0:9:41,521
(Narrator)
We are not born with greed,
envy, hatred, or bigotry.


120
0:9:41,521 --> 0:9:48,67
Our behavior and values
are reflective of the culture we are exposed to.


121
0:9:48,67 --> 0:9:52,361
If you were raised
by the headhunters of the Amazon


122
0:9:52,361 --> 0:9:54,361
you'd be a headhunter.


123
0:9:54,361 --> 0:9:58,808
If I said to you
"Doesn't it bother you to have 5 shrunken heads?"


124
0:9:58,808 --> 0:10:2,889
you'd say
"Yes, my brother has 20."


125
0:10:2,889 --> 0:10:10,98
Is he nuts?
No, that's normal to his culture.


126
0:10:10,98 --> 0:10:14,762
Social and environmental problems
will remain insurmountable


127
0:10:14,762 --> 0:10:18,654
as long as few nations control
most of the Earth's resources


128
0:10:18,654 --> 0:10:23,347
and the bottom line is profit
over the well-being of people.


129
0:10:23,347 --> 0:10:26,965
Putting profit first results in
unnecessary suffering


130
0:10:26,965 --> 0:10:33,894
and aberrant behavior
prevalent today.


131
0:10:33,894 --> 0:10:38,615
Many people feel that we need
the rule of law to eliminate our problems.


132
0:10:38,615 --> 0:10:42,148
We have many laws,
thousands upon thousands of them


133
0:10:42,148 --> 0:10:45,794
but they are constantly being broken.


134
0:10:45,794 --> 0:10:51,175
Paper proclamations and treaties
do not alter the facts of scarcity


135
0:10:51,175 --> 0:10:56,664
deprivation, and insecurity.


136
0:10:56,664 --> 0:11:2,61
You can predict the shape of the future
and the values if you know


137
0:11:2,61 --> 0:11:7,616
the trends of events in the ocean pollution,
the scarcity of arable land...


138
0:11:7,616 --> 0:11:11,211
If you watch that degrading system grow


139
0:11:11,211 --> 0:11:15,981
I can predict the riots
and killing and assassination.


140
0:11:15,981 --> 0:11:20,457
Human behavior is really generated
by the surrounding environment.


141
0:11:20,457 --> 0:11:26,97
If there's a scarcity, say of water,
it is prized and its price is high.


142
0:11:26,97 --> 0:11:29,583
Let's discuss scarcity
as a system.


143
0:11:29,583 --> 0:11:34,404
Suppose it rained gold
for about 3 days, gold dust.


144
0:11:34,404 --> 0:11:36,969
People would go out and shovel it in,
fill their cellars


145
0:11:36,969 --> 0:11:40,215
the attic, every drawer in the house.
They'd throw out their clothing.


146
0:11:40,215 --> 0:11:44,861
If the rain kept up for a year
so that gold was all over the place


147
0:11:44,861 --> 0:11:48,869
people would sweep it out of the house,
take their rings off, throw them away


148
0:11:48,869 --> 0:11:52,78
and so human behavior
undergoes change to that condition.


149
0:11:52,78 --> 0:11:58,535
There's only a policeman
in front of something that people have need for


150
0:11:58,535 --> 0:12:2,236
and don't have access to,
so you put a guard there.


151
0:12:2,236 --> 0:12:5,411
But if lemon trees or
orange trees and apple trees


152
0:12:5,411 --> 0:12:8,618
grew all over the place,
you couldn't sell it.


153
0:12:8,618 --> 0:12:12,417
If you landed on an island
that was so abundant with resources


154
0:12:12,417 --> 0:12:16,823
you had 10 people, there were 1000 fish
for every person if you wanted it,


155
0:12:16,823 --> 0:12:19,757
there were 10 times
the amount of breadfruit and bananas


156
0:12:19,757 --> 0:12:21,973
money would not come into existence.


157
0:12:21,973 --> 0:12:24,9
Private property
would not come into existence.


158
0:12:24,9 --> 0:12:29,546
If the island was big enough:
there were 10 people, there were 8000 acres


159
0:12:29,546 --> 0:12:35,87
no one would give a damn
about staking out this particular area.


160
0:12:35,87 --> 0:12:38,434
There are patterns of behavior
that promote survival.


161
0:12:38,434 --> 0:12:42,555
There are social conditions
that change our values and outlook.


162
0:12:42,555 --> 0:12:47,94
No one can write
a constitution of required behavior


163
0:12:47,94 --> 0:12:51,588
without consulting the environment.


164
0:12:51,588 --> 0:12:54,158
So, we'd better take care
of the environment


165
0:12:54,158 --> 0:12:58,374
we'd better take care of one another
and we'd better educate people


166
0:12:58,374 --> 0:13:1,904
to the highest possible levels
of our ability


167
0:13:1,904 --> 0:13:6,218
in order to have a society.


168
0:13:6,218 --> 0:13:9,13
(Narrator)
Even a peace treaty
cannot prevent another war


169
0:13:9,13 --> 0:13:13,376
if the underlying causes
are not dealt with.


170
0:13:13,376 --> 0:13:16,785
Maybe what are needed
are ethical people in government


171
0:13:16,785 --> 0:13:21,247
who will work toward
everyone's well-being.


172
0:13:21,247 --> 0:13:24,847
But even if the most ethical people
were elected to high positions


173
0:13:24,847 --> 0:13:28,77
and we ran out of resources,
there would still be lying


174
0:13:28,77 --> 0:13:32,354
cheating, stealing and corruption.


175
0:13:32,354 --> 0:13:35,608
It's not ethical people
that are needed but rather


176
0:13:35,608 --> 0:13:51,686
a way of intelligently managing
the Earth's resources for everyone's well-being.


177
0:13:51,686 --> 0:13:56,602
Let's examine
our social arrangements further.


178
0:13:56,602 --> 0:14:3,475
To maintain our economy,
products must continuously be sold.


179
0:14:3,475 --> 0:14:9,649
To assure this, they are deliberately designed
to wear out and break down.


180
0:14:9,649 --> 0:14:12,306
Maybe you've noticed
this usually happens


181
0:14:12,306 --> 0:14:17,588
right after the warranty expires.


182
0:14:17,588 --> 0:14:22,645
This corrupt practice
is referred to as 'planned obsolescence'


183
0:14:22,645 --> 0:14:28,59
which is the conscious withdrawal
of efficiency.


184
0:14:28,59 --> 0:14:32,327
Innovators go through the finest schools
and then are required


185
0:14:32,327 --> 0:14:38,787
to design things that wear out
and break down right on schedule.


186
0:14:38,787 --> 0:14:45,462
This results in a tremendous waste
of resources and energy.


187
0:14:45,462 --> 0:14:52,203
We are plundering the planet
for profits.


188
0:14:52,203 --> 0:14:55,812
If you think about it,
it isn't a job people want


189
0:14:55,812 --> 0:14:59,646
but access
to what their paycheck will bring.


190
0:14:59,646 --> 0:15:2,416
Money does not represent anything real


191
0:15:2,416 --> 0:15:9,753
and there's no gold,
silver or resource to back it up.


192
0:15:9,753 --> 0:15:12,794
You can't eat money
or build a house of it.


193
0:15:12,794 --> 0:15:15,44
It is not even related
to our real capacity


194
0:15:15,44 --> 0:15:18,816
to produce goods and services
on this planet.


195
0:15:18,816 --> 0:15:22,769
The monetary system
has been handed down from centuries ago


196
0:15:22,769 --> 0:15:34,312
and we continue to use it
without questions.


197
0:15:34,312 --> 0:15:37,494
This system will keep installing
more and more automation


198
0:15:37,494 --> 0:15:40,956
cutting down on the purchasing power
of the majority of people.


199
0:15:40,956 --> 0:15:44,331
There will come a time
(it's called the Gaussian curve)


200
0:15:44,331 --> 0:15:47,625
where employment is that,
production is this


201
0:15:47,625 --> 0:15:51,525
and purchasing power is that.
The system stops.


202
0:15:51,525 --> 0:15:53,75
Banks fail
and nothing works anymore.


203
0:15:53,75 --> 0:15:56,977
We're moving in that direction
very rapidly.


204
0:15:56,977 --> 0:16:2,27
- We have finally gotten to a place
in 2011


205
0:16:2,27 --> 0:16:5,534
where it's becoming obvious
that the machine has beaten the man.


206
0:16:5,534 --> 0:16:10,37
- We are incredibly productive
with far fewer people.


207
0:16:10,37 --> 0:16:12,932
- We are more productive as an economy
than ever before.


208
0:16:12,932 --> 0:16:16,219
- An iPad app can do more
than four people.


209
0:16:16,219 --> 0:16:19,81
- It's just that there are fewer jobs.
The jobs that do exist now


210
0:16:19,81 --> 0:16:21,543
can have lower wages
because of obvious reasons:


211
0:16:21,543 --> 0:16:24,272
a lot of people are looking for
a small number of jobs.


212
0:16:24,272 --> 0:16:27,81
The wages go down,
that has huge impacts on the middle class


213
0:16:27,81 --> 0:16:29,266
and ripples out from there.


214
0:16:29,266 --> 0:16:31,572
We're moving towards social collapse.


215
0:16:31,572 --> 0:16:35,163
I think this is going to happen
all over the world, not just here.


216
0:16:35,163 --> 0:16:37,821
It doesn't require
the overthrow of the government.


217
0:16:37,821 --> 0:16:42,289
It just requires that you let it alone;
it will overthrow itself.


218
0:16:42,289 --> 0:16:45,876
If you control the media,
you can calm people down.


219
0:16:45,876 --> 0:16:50,274
But if the majority keeps getting laid off,
they don't have purchasing power


220
0:16:50,274 --> 0:16:53,963
the system collapses.
It doesn't work anymore; they invade.


221
0:16:53,963 --> 0:16:58,631
It's already happening,
this country is already insoluble.


222
0:16:58,631 --> 0:17:3,719
They're going to have difficulty
with national security, paying pension people:


223
0:17:3,719 --> 0:17:7,256
they've spent far beyond
what they already have.


224
0:17:7,256 --> 0:17:12,99
All they can do now is create debt,
borrow more and more money from banks.


225
0:17:12,99 --> 0:17:15,121
- We also want to show you
a rather grim sign of our times


226
0:17:15,121 --> 0:17:17,529
it's not far from here
in Midtown Manhattan.


227
0:17:17,529 --> 0:17:22,721
The national debt has grown too large
for the National Debt Clock.


228
0:17:22,721 --> 0:17:24,654
It went up back in 1989


229
0:17:24,654 --> 0:17:28,194
when the nation's debt
was less than 3 trillion dollars.


230
0:17:28,194 --> 0:17:33,289
The debt has been piling up so fast lately
they had to drop the dollar sign


231
0:17:33,289 --> 0:17:36,869
to make room for an extra digit
as the number turned over


232
0:17:36,869 --> 0:17:42,164
to more than ten trillion dollars now
and counting every second.


233
0:17:42,164 --> 0:17:47,52
A whole new clock with two extra spaces
will go up next year.


234
0:17:47,52 --> 0:17:50,978
The federal government
is not allowed to print money.


235
0:17:50,978 --> 0:17:54,405
It's not allowed to lend money
or get in the banking business.


236
0:17:54,405 --> 0:17:57,163
That is a privilege
for bankers only.


237
0:17:57,163 --> 0:18:0,617
So what the government has to do
if they want to build an air force


238
0:18:0,617 --> 0:18:2,438
say of 2000 planes a month


239
0:18:2,438 --> 0:18:6,514
they have to borrow money
from a private lending institution


240
0:18:6,514 --> 0:18:10,127
sign the dotted line,
and if the war is lost or failed


241
0:18:10,127 --> 0:18:37,859
the burden falls on the public
to pay off that debt.


242
0:18:37,859 --> 0:18:40,782
(Narrator)
We find ourselves
and our social constructs


243
0:18:40,782 --> 0:18:45,98
in a transitional state,
a matter of social evolution.


244
0:18:45,98 --> 0:18:47,916
If we want to make it
through these turbulent times


245
0:18:47,916 --> 0:18:51,542
we must be able
to adapt to change.


246
0:18:51,542 --> 0:18:57,79
All things change,
including our social systems.


247
0:18:57,79 --> 0:19:9,679
Albert Einstein stated:


248
0:19:9,679 --> 0:19:12,438
Earth is still abundant
with resources.


249
0:19:12,438 --> 0:19:16,3
Our practice of rationing resources
through monetary control


250
0:19:16,3 --> 0:19:23,427
is no longer relevant and is actually counterproductive
to our very survival.


251
0:19:23,427 --> 0:19:27,27
Today we have highly advanced technologies


252
0:19:27,27 --> 0:19:32,388
but our social and economic system
has not kept up with our technological capabilities


253
0:19:32,388 --> 0:19:36,332
which could otherwise easily create
a world of abundance for all


254
0:19:36,332 --> 0:19:39,457
free of servitude and debt.


255
0:19:39,457 --> 0:19:42,881
How can this be possible?


256
0:19:42,881 --> 0:19:46,95
There is not enough money
to feed or house all people on this planet


257
0:19:46,95 --> 0:19:50,841
let alone accomplish
these more ambitious ends.


258
0:19:50,841 --> 0:19:56,123
But Earth has more than enough resources
to meet the needs of all people


259
0:19:56,123 --> 0:20:9,4
but only if managed intelligently.


260
0:20:9,4 --> 0:20:12,174
(Narrator)
Jacque Fresco envisions a solution
that he calls


261
0:20:12,174 --> 0:20:14,336
a Resource-Based Economy.


262
0:20:14,336 --> 0:20:17,932
It is a socio-economic system
in which all goods and services


263
0:20:17,932 --> 0:20:21,899
are available to everyone
without the use of money


264
0:20:21,899 --> 0:20:27,7
barter, credit,
debt or servitude of any kind.


265
0:20:27,7 --> 0:20:31,715
It is unlike any social system
that has gone before.


266
0:20:31,715 --> 0:20:34,852
Fresco arrived at this direction
through 75 years of study


267
0:20:34,852 --> 0:20:42,677
and experimental research.


268
0:20:42,677 --> 0:20:48,3
A Resource-Based Economy
operates on the basis of available resources


269
0:20:48,3 --> 0:20:52,507
and makes those resources available
to every human being on earth


270
0:20:52,507 --> 0:20:55,458
free of charge,
without a price tag.


271
0:20:55,458 --> 0:20:59,383
We have today
more than enough resources


272
0:20:59,383 --> 0:21:2,431
to build a far more advanced society.


273
0:21:2,431 --> 0:21:6,943
I'm not talking about limited handouts
so that people just get by.


274
0:21:6,943 --> 0:21:9,674
I'm talking about
a very advanced civilization.


275
0:21:9,674 --> 0:21:14,479
We have the resources, we have the technology,
all we have to do is apply it.


276
0:21:14,479 --> 0:21:17,491
(Roxanne Meadows)
One of the main aspects
of The Venus Project


277
0:21:17,491 --> 0:21:22,957
is to eliminate scarcity;
this is where the technology comes into play.


278
0:21:22,957 --> 0:21:25,391
Because if we set up
a Resource-Based Economy


279
0:21:25,391 --> 0:21:28,233
and some things are scarce,
it won't work.


280
0:21:28,233 --> 0:21:30,606
If you set up a Resource-Based Economy


281
0:21:30,606 --> 0:21:34,323
in a society that has no resources,
it won't work.


282
0:21:34,323 --> 0:21:38,149
Today with our technology
we can make things available.


283
0:21:38,149 --> 0:21:42,145
We can eliminate scarcity,
we can create an abundance.


284
0:21:42,145 --> 0:21:46,809
As long as we can create that abundance,
that will eliminate greed


285
0:21:46,809 --> 0:21:53,353
and selfishness, and a lot of crime
and a lot of aberrant behavior.


286
0:21:53,353 --> 0:21:55,752
(Narrator)
A social system can be designed


287
0:21:55,752 --> 0:21:58,541
so that all can live fully
and constructively


288
0:21:58,541 --> 0:22:3,834
if the powers of science and technology are directed
toward human and environmental concern


289
0:22:3,834 --> 0:22:10,9
and overcoming the artificial scarcities
of our debt-based monetary systems.


290
0:22:10,9 --> 0:22:15,316
All people, regardless of political philosophy,
social customs


291
0:22:15,316 --> 0:22:20,139
or religious differences
ultimately depend upon the same resources:


292
0:22:20,139 --> 0:22:22,624
clean air and water


293
0:22:22,624 --> 0:22:24,828
arable land


294
0:22:24,828 --> 0:22:30,43
medical care and a relevant education.


295
0:22:30,43 --> 0:22:36,34
I think if you pledge allegiance
to the Earth and everyone on it


296
0:22:36,34 --> 0:22:39,5
that'd be the way to go for the future.


297
0:22:39,5 --> 0:22:44,192
(Narrator)
The human species is a single family
and the world is home to everyone.


298
0:22:44,192 --> 0:22:49,305
Neither nations nor people
can co-exist separately any longer.


299
0:22:49,305 --> 0:22:53,252
No more separate nations,
so that anyone can go anywhere.


300
0:22:53,252 --> 0:22:58,109
Before the states joined together,
they used to stake out their territory.


301
0:22:58,109 --> 0:23:1,179
They used to fight, they had militias.
They would fight:


302
0:23:1,179 --> 0:23:4,309
"This is our territory!"
"Oh no you're intruding!"


303
0:23:4,309 --> 0:23:6,972
When all the states joined together,
the government


304
0:23:6,972 --> 0:23:10,279
worked out the lines of the states
and they agreed.


305
0:23:10,279 --> 0:23:13,508
That was the end of territorial disputes.


306
0:23:13,508 --> 0:23:28,301
If you want the end of war,
you must declare the Earth common heritage.


307
0:23:28,301 --> 0:23:33,757
This has nothing to do with those
who want to form an elite world order


308
0:23:33,757 --> 0:23:37,664
with themselves and large corporations
in control


309
0:23:37,664 --> 0:23:41,134
and the rest of the world
subservient to them.


310
0:23:41,134 --> 0:23:44,999
On the contrary,
a global Resource-Based Economy


311
0:23:44,999 --> 0:23:48,663
enables all people
to reach their highest potential


312
0:23:48,663 --> 0:23:53,878
where they can thrive and grow
in a society that works in their behalf


313
0:23:53,878 --> 0:23:58,438
a society that protects
and preserves the environment as well.


314
0:23:58,438 --> 0:24:13,125
One that understands that we are part of nature,
not separate from it.


315
0:24:13,125 --> 0:24:16,482
(Narrator)
Some question what would happen to incentive
if needs were met


316
0:24:16,482 --> 0:24:19,297
without our having to work
to attain them.


317
0:24:19,297 --> 0:24:23,539
The question assumes humans
have no desires beyond basic needs.


318
0:24:23,539 --> 0:24:27,945
If that were true,
there would be no inventors


319
0:24:27,945 --> 0:24:30,517
writers or teachers.


320
0:24:30,517 --> 0:24:34,603
People work with passion
on the things that interest and challenge them.


321
0:24:34,603 --> 0:24:37,186
Let's enable all people
to have the opportunity


322
0:24:37,186 --> 0:24:40,199
to partake in the greatest challenge
one can have:


323
0:24:40,199 --> 0:24:44,912
improving our world for everyone.


324
0:24:44,912 --> 0:24:49,502
Individuality will be emphasized
rather than uniformity.


325
0:24:49,502 --> 0:24:52,969
This social arrangement will generate
a new incentive system


326
0:24:52,969 --> 0:24:56,716
that values the protection of the environment
and social concern


327
0:24:56,716 --> 0:24:59,237
rather than the shallow self-centered goals


328
0:24:59,237 --> 0:25:3,85
of wealth, property and power.


329
0:25:3,85 --> 0:25:8,694
It does not call for uniformity.
It absolutely calls for diversity:


330
0:25:8,694 --> 0:25:12,464
the more diverse people are,
the more individuality.


331
0:25:12,464 --> 0:25:17,829
So we emphasize individuality,
creativity, innovativeness.


332
0:25:17,829 --> 0:25:20,609
This is the essentials of the design.


333
0:25:20,609 --> 0:25:24,8
It is not a group of scientists
telling people what to do


334
0:25:24,8 --> 0:25:27,864
how to live, where to go,
what to follow.


335
0:25:27,864 --> 0:25:32,405
(Narrator)
Motivation and incentive exist
when people have meaningful tasks.


336
0:25:32,405 --> 0:25:36,235
True growth and development occur
when people are involved in creative


337
0:25:36,235 --> 0:25:39,278
challenging and constructive endeavors.


338
0:25:39,278 --> 0:25:43,5
However, motivation and incentive die
in the daily grind


339
0:25:43,5 --> 0:25:48,363
of boring and repetitive jobs
required to earn a paycheck.


340
0:25:48,363 --> 0:25:50,733
If you hand out things to people


341
0:25:50,733 --> 0:25:53,381
if you fed them, clothed them
and housed them for free


342
0:25:53,381 --> 0:25:56,32
they're not going to work in the morning
because they don't need it.


343
0:25:56,32 --> 0:25:59,745
They've got their housing, clothing,
motion pictures and entertainment.


344
0:25:59,745 --> 0:26:5,65
Why go to work? Work is painful,
it's monotonous, it's boring.


345
0:26:5,65 --> 0:26:10,234
In the future, if people have access
to all their needs


346
0:26:10,234 --> 0:26:14,165
but they don't have any challenges,
this is where it goes to pot.


347
0:26:14,165 --> 0:26:18,86
So people constantly
[will be] challenged by new things.


348
0:26:18,86 --> 0:26:22,902
In our schools we challenge them
with many things that are not solved


349
0:26:22,902 --> 0:26:25,156
and [there are] many unresolved problems.


350
0:26:25,156 --> 0:26:29,361
If you are well fed and well clothed,
that doesn't stop your brain from working.


351
0:26:29,361 --> 0:26:32,717
That would mean
that every millionaire does nothing, it's turned off


352
0:26:32,717 --> 0:26:35,213
because you've got all the means.
That's not true.


353
0:26:35,213 --> 0:26:38,57
There are many millionaires
that work 18 hours a day


354
0:26:38,57 --> 0:26:41,564
and don't have enough time.
It has to do with your background


355
0:26:41,564 --> 0:26:45,966
and your education. The more you know
about oceanography, astronomy, etc.


356
0:26:45,966 --> 0:26:48,333
the more interested,
the more alive you are.


357
0:26:48,333 --> 0:26:51,741
If you're just given food,
clothing and shelter, now you can go to work.


358
0:26:51,741 --> 0:26:53,884
You don't have to worry about
making a living


359
0:26:53,884 --> 0:26:56,916
and your incentive
would be boosted considerably.


360
0:26:56,916 --> 0:27:0,933
I call that a new
and innovative incentive system:


361
0:27:0,933 --> 0:27:5,299
it's not monetary oriented,
it's problem-solving oriented.


362
0:27:5,299 --> 0:27:18,316
You get your kicks out of seeing the world
become a better place.


363
0:27:18,316 --> 0:27:21,706
(Narrator)
How can we use our technology wisely


364
0:27:21,706 --> 0:27:25,95
so that there is
more than enough for everyone?


365
0:27:25,95 --> 0:27:29,32
To achieve this, it's mandatory
that the planning for it


366
0:27:29,32 --> 0:27:35,692
be based on the carrying capacity
of the planet's resources.


367
0:27:35,692 --> 0:27:38,453
Our entire infrastructure
must be redesigned


368
0:27:38,453 --> 0:27:42,448
and operated as coherent,
integrated, total systems.


369
0:27:42,448 --> 0:27:46,511
This means we must consider
our entire global community as one unit


370
0:27:46,511 --> 0:27:49,886
that includes everyone
and plan accordingly.


371
0:27:49,886 --> 0:27:54,615
Only in this way can we use
our technology to overcome resource shortages


372
0:27:54,615 --> 0:28:1,307
provide universal abundance
and protect the environment.


373
0:28:1,307 --> 0:28:6,221
Therefore, a global survey is first needed
to assess exactly what we have.


374
0:28:6,221 --> 0:28:10,157
This would inventory
our physical resources, personnel


375
0:28:10,157 --> 0:28:14,368
production centers
and the needs of people.


376
0:28:14,368 --> 0:28:18,781
This enables us to determine
the amount of goods and services needed.


377
0:28:18,781 --> 0:28:22,425
For instance,
where is the arable land to grow crops?


378
0:28:22,425 --> 0:28:25,14
How many people are in various locations


379
0:28:25,14 --> 0:28:27,516
and what is the state of their health?


380
0:28:27,516 --> 0:28:33,529
This would determine
where hospitals are built and how many.


381
0:28:33,529 --> 0:28:36,16
If you try to do that today


382
0:28:36,16 --> 0:28:40,539
(ask for a global resource survey of all nations),
they'd wonder


383
0:28:40,539 --> 0:28:43,664
"What are you trying to do that for?
To find if we've got enough resources


384
0:28:43,664 --> 0:28:46,84
to fight you in armaments
and other things?"


385
0:28:46,84 --> 0:28:50,104
They would be skeptical,
hesitant, to give that information.


386
0:28:50,104 --> 0:28:53,778
So I would say it wouldn't work
in today's culture.


387
0:28:53,778 --> 0:28:57,844
But after the ideas are put forth
and the reason for it


388
0:28:57,844 --> 0:29:0,52
and the advantages gained
by all the nations...


389
0:29:0,52 --> 0:29:2,897
It would have to be specific advantages


390
0:29:2,897 --> 0:29:6,291
that they can understand in their terms.


391
0:29:6,291 --> 0:29:10,56
If they agree,
then the survey would be conducted.


392
0:29:10,56 --> 0:29:14,736
It's not my opinion
or the opinion of anyone else that would be used.


393
0:29:14,736 --> 0:29:18,895
It's the size of the population,
the availability of resources


394
0:29:18,895 --> 0:29:21,9
the carrying capacity of the Earth,
that determines


395
0:29:21,9 --> 0:29:24,998
what is done and how fast things move.


396
0:29:24,998 --> 0:29:28,145
Today it's done on a totally different basis


397
0:29:28,145 --> 0:29:31,355
but in the future it will all be based on


398
0:29:31,355 --> 0:29:33,935
a form of dynamic equilibrium.


399
0:29:33,935 --> 0:29:38,381
That means operating everything
at the highest potential


400
0:29:38,381 --> 0:29:43,117
without environmental neglect.


401
0:29:43,117 --> 0:29:47,21
(Narrator)
The key to achieving abundance
and a high standard of living for all


402
0:29:47,21 --> 0:29:52,747
is to automate as much as possible
in the shortest period of time.


403
0:29:52,747 --> 0:29:57,17
But during the transition,
we have to bring together


404
0:29:57,17 --> 0:30:2,457
the technological capabilities of people
working with computers


405
0:30:2,457 --> 0:30:5,601
and working with technology


406
0:30:5,601 --> 0:30:10,577
and building and designing methods
of delivering these resources


407
0:30:10,577 --> 0:30:16,686
and the necessary industrial plants
to process the resources.


408
0:30:16,686 --> 0:30:21,188
(Narrator)
Our problems and their solutions
are technical, not political.


409
0:30:21,188 --> 0:30:24,919
Most problems can be solved
when technology and the methods of science


410
0:30:24,919 --> 0:30:29,955
are used to serve all people,
not just a select few.


411
0:30:29,955 --> 0:30:32,166
What is it that you want?
You have to ask yourself.


412
0:30:32,166 --> 0:30:34,792
I want to live in a world
where I don't have to fear


413
0:30:34,792 --> 0:30:38,19
that my children
will go into another war


414
0:30:38,19 --> 0:30:41,921
where there will be deprivation,
problems or disease.


415
0:30:41,921 --> 0:30:44,519
"Do you know how to build that kind of world?"
"No I don't!"


416
0:30:44,519 --> 0:30:48,954
How do you go about building?
You call upon the various divisions of science


417
0:30:48,954 --> 0:30:52,935
bring them together and say
"These are the problems we'd like to solve."


418
0:30:52,935 --> 0:30:57,677
A scientific government doesn't mean
that scientists rule or control people.


419
0:30:57,677 --> 0:31:2,51
It means they have better means
for building transportation systems


420
0:31:2,51 --> 0:31:5,181
better means for cleaning the air,
they have the best means


421
0:31:5,181 --> 0:31:12,535
for restoring the oceans
that we know of to this day.


422
0:31:12,535 --> 0:31:14,982
(Narrator)
Computers can serve the needs
of everyone


423
0:31:14,982 --> 0:31:18,16
when cybernation
is ultimately integrated into all aspects


424
0:31:18,16 --> 0:31:22,22
of this new and dynamic culture.


425
0:31:22,22 --> 0:31:25,242
One can think of this
as an electronic nervous system


426
0:31:25,242 --> 0:31:30,5
extending into all areas
of the social complex.


427
0:31:30,5 --> 0:31:34,738
Their function would be to coordinate a balance
between production and distribution


428
0:31:34,738 --> 0:31:39,163
assuring there are no shortages or overruns.


429
0:31:39,163 --> 0:31:41,314
(Roxanne Meadows)
In this highly technical society


430
0:31:41,314 --> 0:31:44,408
decisions are based on direct environmental


431
0:31:44,408 --> 0:31:47,114
human and industrial feedback.


432
0:31:47,114 --> 0:31:49,824
You can think of this
as electrical sensors


433
0:31:49,824 --> 0:31:52,76
throughout the entire environment


434
0:31:52,76 --> 0:31:54,809
from cities, factories, warehouses


435
0:31:54,809 --> 0:31:58,329
distribution centers, transportation networks


436
0:31:58,329 --> 0:32:3,5
all over the globe gathering data
for more appropriate decisions.


437
0:32:3,5 --> 0:32:6,469
The decisions are based on
the needs of society


438
0:32:6,469 --> 0:32:11,101
rather than corporate or private interests.


439
0:32:11,101 --> 0:32:15,257
(Narrator)
It is not automated technology
or machines we should be wary of


440
0:32:15,257 --> 0:32:19,901
but the abuse and misuse of technology
by selfish interests.


441
0:32:19,901 --> 0:32:25,96
Remember, it is people who decide
what ends the machines will serve.


442
0:32:25,96 --> 0:32:27,577
If technology
does not liberate all people


443
0:32:27,577 --> 0:32:30,785
for the pursuit of higher aspirations
in human achievement


444
0:32:30,785 --> 0:32:35,67
then all its technological potential
will be meaningless.


445
0:32:35,67 --> 0:32:38,48
You always do a positive
and negative study


446
0:32:38,48 --> 0:32:51,356
before you engage in the actual reconstruction
of an environment.


447
0:32:51,356 --> 0:32:54,641
(Narrator)
It's all just talk unless
there is a technical plan


448
0:32:54,641 --> 0:33:0,928
to organize and use resources
to accomplish abundance.


449
0:33:0,928 --> 0:33:4,481
What follows are some of the many approaches
The Venus Project provides


450
0:33:4,481 --> 0:33:13,507
for the entire social spectrum.


451
0:33:13,507 --> 0:33:17,881
Today more than half our population
lives in cities that are polluted


452
0:33:17,881 --> 0:33:21,768
dangerous and waste energy.


453
0:33:21,768 --> 0:33:24,877
What we have to do is design a city
as a living system


454
0:33:24,877 --> 0:33:27,121
as an organism, as a university:


455
0:33:27,121 --> 0:33:30,796
that all the cities of the future
will be university cities


456
0:33:30,796 --> 0:33:33,654
that grow, that continue to exchange ideas.


457
0:33:33,654 --> 0:33:38,74
The city will have a built-in transportation system
so there are no accidents


458
0:33:38,74 --> 0:33:41,222
and no unthought out areas of technology.


459
0:33:41,222 --> 0:33:48,353
Medicine, botany, agriculture, the total system:
one planning system.


460
0:33:48,353 --> 0:33:51,83
(Narrator)
It is actually better to build
newer cities from the ground up


461
0:33:51,83 --> 0:33:57,55
than to restore and maintain old ones.


462
0:33:57,55 --> 0:34:0,943
Fresco uses a systems approach
to designing new cities.


463
0:34:0,943 --> 0:34:6,526
They're desirable and pleasant places
to live.


464
0:34:6,526 --> 0:34:12,129
The notion that intelligent overall planning
implies mass uniformity is absurd.


465
0:34:12,129 --> 0:34:16,857
Cities would be uniform only to the degree
that they would require far less materials


466
0:34:16,857 --> 0:34:19,176
save time and energy


467
0:34:19,176 --> 0:34:22,443
and be flexible enough
to allow for innovative changes


468
0:34:22,443 --> 0:34:27,558
while preserving the local ecology.


469
0:34:27,558 --> 0:34:31,885
If we design our cities to meet human needs


470
0:34:31,885 --> 0:34:36,991
you don't have most of the problems
that are prevalent today.


471
0:34:36,991 --> 0:34:40,165
In the central dome you have childcare


472
0:34:40,165 --> 0:34:44,259
schools, dental care, medical care.


473
0:34:44,259 --> 0:34:47,317
In the production and design of the cities


474
0:34:47,317 --> 0:34:52,719
we work out 1/8th of the city system
and then we reproduce it


475
0:34:52,719 --> 0:34:58,3
instead of having architects
design each building and each structure


476
0:34:58,3 --> 0:35:5,493
which is a tremendous waste
of energy and talent.


477
0:35:5,493 --> 0:35:9,187
(Narrator)
When working on solving the housing problem
for all the world's people


478
0:35:9,187 --> 0:35:14,634
construction techniques would be vastly different
from those employed today.


479
0:35:14,634 --> 0:35:17,943
Extruded and self-erecting structures
could revolutionize


480
0:35:17,943 --> 0:35:21,532
and speed up construction processes.


481
0:35:21,532 --> 0:35:26,219
These lightweight, durable apartments
could be produced as continuous extrusions


482
0:35:26,219 --> 0:35:31,276
and then separated and positioned in place
by the mega-machines.


483
0:35:31,276 --> 0:35:35,434
The outer shells of these efficient structures
serve as photovoltaic generators


484
0:35:35,434 --> 0:35:39,535
and heat concentrators.


485
0:35:39,535 --> 0:35:42,22
You don't own anything in this society.


486
0:35:42,22 --> 0:35:45,35
Really, people don't want money;


487
0:35:45,35 --> 0:35:48,477
they want access to things
when they want it.


488
0:35:48,477 --> 0:35:53,531
People in a society of abundance,
having access to things


489
0:35:53,531 --> 0:35:58,174
will really no longer begin to store
and accumulate things.


490
0:35:58,174 --> 0:36:1,501
We recycle it,
update it, make it better.


491
0:36:1,501 --> 0:36:4,294
Take the same materials
of an old car


492
0:36:4,294 --> 0:36:8,488
[they] weigh just as much as a new car,
so there are no old cars.


493
0:36:8,488 --> 0:36:10,683
Old cars mean danger.


494
0:36:10,683 --> 0:36:15,642
If you drive a very expensive car
and somebody else drives a beat-up old car


495
0:36:15,642 --> 0:36:18,604
if their brakes fail, you may die.


496
0:36:18,604 --> 0:36:21,82
We don't want any old cars on the highway.


497
0:36:21,82 --> 0:36:23,406
We don't want anything that breaks down.


498
0:36:23,406 --> 0:36:27,492
We don't want anything
that takes looking after.


499
0:36:27,492 --> 0:36:31,942
(Narrator)
In a Resource-Based Economy,
people may access whatever products they need


500
0:36:31,942 --> 0:36:37,681
without the burden of having to purchase,
maintain or insure their possessions.


501
0:36:37,681 --> 0:36:40,929
In this way, there is much more to go around
for everyone


502
0:36:40,929 --> 0:36:44,353
and products are always available when needed.


503
0:36:44,353 --> 0:36:51,248
Anything people may need
is available in these outside access domes:


504
0:36:51,248 --> 0:36:55,434
sculpturing materials, musical instruments,


505
0:36:55,434 --> 0:36:57,681
somewhat like a public library.


506
0:36:57,681 --> 0:37:2,34
They can go down and access a camera,
a bicycle or a wristwatch.


507
0:37:2,34 --> 0:37:7,429
Anything they need
is available without a price tag.


508
0:37:7,429 --> 0:37:13,252
That would mean we must achieve
a level of production that's so high


509
0:37:13,252 --> 0:37:16,273
that scarcity no longer exists.


510
0:37:16,273 --> 0:37:20,567
That will prevent almost all crime.


511
0:37:20,567 --> 0:37:24,884
There is no way of segmenting
or making this system just or equitable.


512
0:37:24,884 --> 0:37:28,709
We have to make a system
that assures human rights.


513
0:37:28,709 --> 0:37:31,579
When everybody has free access
to goods and services


514
0:37:31,579 --> 0:37:34,757
you don't have to fight for women's rights,
or black rights.


515
0:37:34,757 --> 0:37:37,635
It's an automatic in a society
that is set up that way.


516
0:37:37,635 --> 0:37:44,271
You don't have to make laws [like] 'Don't steal';
it would bypass that behavior.


517
0:37:44,271 --> 0:37:48,62
(Jacque Fresco)
Surrounding the central dome,
you have the research centers


518
0:37:48,62 --> 0:37:51,912
centers that do work that's relevant


519
0:37:51,912 --> 0:37:55,662
to the sustainability
of the entire community.


520
0:37:55,662 --> 0:37:58,618
As we move away
from the research centers


521
0:37:58,618 --> 0:38:1,591
we come to the recreational area


522
0:38:1,591 --> 0:38:11,571
which has tennis courts
and all of the games that people require.


523
0:38:11,571 --> 0:38:15,429
As we move away from that
we come to the residential district.


524
0:38:15,429 --> 0:38:27,138
There are streams, waterfalls,
lakes throughout the area.


525
0:38:27,138 --> 0:38:30,463
(Narrator)
We could provide a wide range
of unique homes and apartments


526
0:38:30,463 --> 0:38:34,351
that can be relatively maintenance free,
fireproof


527
0:38:34,351 --> 0:38:43,412
and virtually impervious
to adverse weather conditions.


528
0:38:43,412 --> 0:38:47,423
As we move to the next sector,
we come to apartments.


529
0:38:47,423 --> 0:38:50,438
The reason some people
want to live in apartments


530
0:38:50,438 --> 0:38:54,449
is because you have drama groups,
you have gymnasiums


531
0:38:54,449 --> 0:38:59,564
medical care, dental care;
everything is built-in to the central towers.


532
0:38:59,564 --> 0:39:4,375
I feel that in the future,
people will move away from individual houses


533
0:39:4,375 --> 0:39:8,478
and live in larger complexes.


534
0:39:8,478 --> 0:39:13,292
As we move outward
we come to the indoor agriculture


535
0:39:13,292 --> 0:39:15,404
or hydroponic farms.


536
0:39:15,404 --> 0:39:21,995
Then there is also outdoor agriculture.


537
0:39:21,995 --> 0:39:24,762
(Narrator)
The city would use the best
of clean technology


538
0:39:24,762 --> 0:39:29,968
in harmony with nature,
such as wind, solar, geothermal


539
0:39:29,968 --> 0:39:35,509
heat concentrators, piezoelectric,
wave, temperature differentials


540
0:39:35,509 --> 0:39:39,6
ocean thermal vents and much more.


541
0:39:39,6 --> 0:39:42,588
A major development for generating energy
in the future


542
0:39:42,588 --> 0:39:50,703
could be the construction of a land bridge
or tunnel across the Bering Strait.


543
0:39:50,703 --> 0:39:54,28
These underwater structures
convert a portion of the ocean currents


544
0:39:54,28 --> 0:39:58,357
through turbines to generate
clean sources of power.


545
0:39:58,357 --> 0:40:2,174
By using these sources of energy
we could power the earth on clean energy


546
0:40:2,174 --> 0:40:5,694
and enable all people to enjoy
a very high standard of living


547
0:40:5,694 --> 0:40:8,363
for thousands of years to come.


548
0:40:8,363 --> 0:40:12,978
There is no need for the use
of polluting hydrocarbons any longer.


549
0:40:12,978 --> 0:40:17,874
Pollution will be a thing of the past.


550
0:40:17,874 --> 0:40:23,964
All transportation will be integrated
into a worldwide transportation system.


551
0:40:23,964 --> 0:40:31,417
Transportation within cities
will be by transveyors.


552
0:40:31,417 --> 0:40:40,301
City-to-city travel
will be by monorail.


553
0:40:40,301 --> 0:40:44,929
Maglev trains are utilized
for long distance travel.


554
0:40:44,929 --> 0:40:47,946
To enhance efficiency,
this high-speed maglev train


555
0:40:47,946 --> 0:40:50,205
is equipped with removable sections


556
0:40:50,205 --> 0:40:54,869
which can be disengaged
while the train is in motion.


557
0:40:54,869 --> 0:41:0,16
Aircraft will display
a wide range of configurations.


558
0:41:0,16 --> 0:41:3,787
These VTOL aircraft
(or Vertical Takeoff and Landing)


559
0:41:3,787 --> 0:41:7,3
are used to transport passengers
and freight.


560
0:41:7,3 --> 0:41:10,253
The priority is safety
rather than saving money


561
0:41:10,253 --> 0:41:14,217
or dealing with the lowest bidder.


562
0:41:14,217 --> 0:41:17,301
This modular freighter
consists of detachable sections


563
0:41:17,301 --> 0:41:20,795
that can be rapidly loaded
or unloaded.


564
0:41:20,795 --> 0:41:25,672
The number of sections varies depending
on the amount of freight to be delivered.


565
0:41:25,672 --> 0:41:31,269
When all the sections are connected
they can be propelled as a single unit.


566
0:41:31,269 --> 0:41:33,69
Ships can be floating manufacturing plants


567
0:41:33,69 --> 0:41:37,78
that produce products
while en route to their destinations.


568
0:41:37,78 --> 0:41:40,597
They can also serve
as education centers


569
0:41:40,597 --> 0:41:45,431
where children and adults travel worldwide
obtaining innovative education


570
0:41:45,431 --> 0:41:48,725
not through vicarious study,
but through experiencing


571
0:41:48,725 --> 0:41:54,547
and interacting with
the 'real-world' environment.


572
0:41:54,547 --> 0:41:58,297
A national transportation system
would include a network of waterways


573
0:41:58,297 --> 0:42:3,17
canals
and irrigation systems.


574
0:42:3,17 --> 0:42:6,3
They could serve to minimize the threat
of floods and droughts


575
0:42:6,3 --> 0:42:10,269
while allowing for the migration of fish,
provide natural firebreaks


576
0:42:10,269 --> 0:42:16,337
emergency water sources,
fish farms and recreation areas.


577
0:42:16,337 --> 0:42:19,454
When we unleash
science and technology


578
0:42:19,454 --> 0:42:21,852
directly into the social system


579
0:42:21,852 --> 0:42:26,756
without the restrictions of the market place,
finances or patents


580
0:42:26,756 --> 0:42:29,542
we could achieve
a very high standard of living


581
0:42:29,542 --> 0:42:32,596
within a very short period of time.


582
0:42:32,596 --> 0:42:35,578
This society would continuously improve


583
0:42:35,578 --> 0:42:40,92
changing rapidly through new technologies,
inventions and ideas.


584
0:42:40,92 --> 0:42:43,224
It would be an emergent society


585
0:42:43,224 --> 0:42:50,99
rather than an established one
like we have today.


586
0:42:50,99 --> 0:42:53,909
(Narrator)
Imagine living in
an extraordinary oceanic city


587
0:42:53,909 --> 0:42:56,194
helping to restore
the ocean environment


588
0:42:56,194 --> 0:43:4,653
while eliminating
land-based population pressures.


589
0:43:4,653 --> 0:43:9,6
These cities in the sea may serve
as universities and research centers


590
0:43:9,6 --> 0:43:14,417
where students study marine sciences.


591
0:43:14,417 --> 0:43:18,829
They could be used for ocean farming,
mariculture and mining


592
0:43:18,829 --> 0:43:24,892
while maintaining a dynamic balance
in the oceanographic environment.


593
0:43:24,892 --> 0:43:28,75
Self-sufficient cities in the sea
vary in design


594
0:43:28,75 --> 0:43:33,67
depending on their location and function.


595
0:43:33,67 --> 0:43:36,123
This undersea observation station
permits people


596
0:43:36,123 --> 0:43:41,122
to view marine life
in its natural habitat.


597
0:43:41,122 --> 0:43:43,841
These mariculture and sea-farming systems


598
0:43:43,841 --> 0:43:47,601
cultivate and raise fish
along with other forms of marine life


599
0:43:47,601 --> 0:43:52,65
to help meet the nutritional needs
of the world's people.


600
0:43:52,65 --> 0:43:59,208
These structures would permit
the free flow of water throughout.


601
0:43:59,208 --> 0:44:3,392
Using technology in this way
would make it possible for a global society


602
0:44:3,392 --> 0:44:7,87
to achieve social advancement
and worldwide reconstruction


603
0:44:7,87 --> 0:44:10,995
in the shortest time possible.


604
0:44:10,995 --> 0:44:16,573
Utopia, if it's ever established,
will die, will stagnate.


605
0:44:16,573 --> 0:44:20,642
Whereas what I'm talking about
is an evolving culture


606
0:44:20,642 --> 0:44:22,691
or an emergent culture.


607
0:44:22,691 --> 0:44:26,657
I have no notions of a perfect society.
I don't know what that means.


608
0:44:26,657 --> 0:44:29,688
I know we can do much better
than what we've got.


609
0:44:29,688 --> 0:44:32,83
I'm no Utopian.
I'm not... a humanist


610
0:44:32,83 --> 0:44:36,21
that would like to see everybody
living in warmth and harmony.


611
0:44:36,21 --> 0:44:41,65
[But] I know that if we don't live that way,
we'll kill each other and destroy the Earth.


612
0:44:41,65 --> 0:44:45,48
(Narrator)
This new lifestyle,
while providing leisure and recreation


613
0:44:45,48 --> 0:44:49,233
would also enhance knowledge and creativity
for everyone.


614
0:44:49,233 --> 0:44:53,405
The measure of success
would be the fulfillment of one's personal interests


615
0:44:53,405 --> 0:44:59,827
rather than the acquisition of wealth
and self-centered goals.


616
0:44:59,827 --> 0:45:3,167
A Resource-Based Economy
would not only change our environment


617
0:45:3,167 --> 0:45:6,565
to make it clean,
efficient and enjoyable


618
0:45:6,565 --> 0:45:8,889
but it would introduce
a new value system


619
0:45:8,889 --> 0:45:13,955
appropriate to the direction
and aims of the new innovative approach.


620
0:45:13,955 --> 0:45:16,44
With education and resources made available


621
0:45:16,44 --> 0:45:19,684
there would be no limit
to the human potential.


622
0:45:19,684 --> 0:45:21,93
Everyone will have the freedom to pursue


623
0:45:21,93 --> 0:45:25,48
whatever constructive field of endeavor
he or she chooses


624
0:45:25,48 --> 0:45:32,849
without the economic limitations
that we face today.


625
0:45:32,849 --> 0:45:36,929
We are now at a time when decisions
must be made


626
0:45:36,929 --> 0:45:41,206
if we wish to evolve
from our present culture of scarcity


627
0:45:41,206 --> 0:45:45,947
waste and environmental destruction


628
0:45:45,947 --> 0:45:51,926
to a sustainable society
of ecological concern and abundance.


629
0:45:51,926 --> 0:45:55,505
A nation without a vision
of what the future can be


630
0:45:55,505 --> 0:45:57,906
is bound to repeat past errors


631
0:45:57,906 --> 0:46:4,811
over
and over again.


632
0:46:4,811 --> 0:46:7,206
We say dishonestly


633
0:46:7,206 --> 0:46:11,187
that man is the highest form of evolution
which [is what] you get in schools.


634
0:46:11,187 --> 0:46:16,881
Man destroys the oceans, the fish,
the atmosphere and one another.


635
0:46:16,881 --> 0:46:20,151
Man flies over a city,
presses a button


636
0:46:20,151 --> 0:46:23,149
and burns everybody in the city
with nuclear weapons.


637
0:46:23,149 --> 0:46:26,718
Is he the highest creation of nature?
Not yet!


638
0:46:26,718 --> 0:46:29,983
in my opinion.
We've got a long way to go.


639
0:46:29,983 --> 0:46:33,833
We could either develop
paradise on Earth or oblivion;


640
0:46:33,833 --> 0:46:37,605
wipe ourselves out,
only the future will tell.


641
0:46:37,605 --> 0:46:43,242
It's what you do to make the future.


642
0:46:43,242 --> 0:46:49,131
(Narrator)
We can create a world where war and want
are distant memories.


643
0:46:49,131 --> 0:46:52,598
When all of science and technology
are used


644
0:46:52,598 --> 0:46:55,706
within a global resource-based economy


645
0:46:55,706 --> 0:47:0,443
for the protection of the environment
and the well-being of all


646
0:47:0,443 --> 0:47:3,413
only then will we understand


647
0:47:3,413 --> 0:47:16,444
what it means to be truly civilized.


648
0:47:16,444 --> 0:47:18,71
Be a part of the growing community
of people


649
0:47:18,71 --> 0:47:22,966
working toward making the aims
of The Venus Project a reality.


650
0:47:22,966 --> 0:47:26,446
Join us in our efforts
to bring this vision of a positive future


651
0:47:26,446 --> 0:47:31,903
to a wider audience
through the goal of a major motion picture.


652
0:47:31,903 --> 0:47:35,192
All of these things
can be built with what we know today.


653
0:47:35,192 --> 0:47:38,251
It would take 10 years
to change the surface of the Earth


654
0:47:38,251 --> 0:47:41,46
to rebuild the world
into a second Garden of Eden.


655
0:47:41,46 --> 0:47:45,12
The choice lies with you.
The stupidity of a nuclear arms race


656
0:47:45,12 --> 0:47:48,825
the development of weapons,
trying to solve your problems politically


657
0:47:48,825 --> 0:47:51,951
by electing this political party
or that political party...


658
0:47:51,951 --> 0:47:54,644
ALL politics are immersed in corruption.


659
0:47:54,644 --> 0:47:57,616
Let me say it again: Communism, Socialism


660
0:47:57,616 --> 0:48:0,12
Fascism, the Democrats, the Liberals.


661
0:48:0,12 --> 0:48:4,669
There are no Negro problems,
Polish problems or Jewish problems


662
0:48:4,669 --> 0:50:4,669
or Greek problems or women's problems.
They're human problems!
