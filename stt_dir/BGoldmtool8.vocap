###15 SUROOSH ALVI: From what we were seeing and hearing, the
###17 secular society that was the hallmark of Saddam Hussein's
###20 Iraq has largely been replaced with religious conservatism.
###25 Mix that with Western-inspired youth culture, and there are
###28 going to be problems.
###29 Subcultures in Iraq are under attack.
###32 For example, the Iraqi equivalent of emo kids are
###35 being targeted.
###37 And in one of the biggest stories out of Iraq since the
###39 US has left, a number of them were supposedly killed.
###43 -[SPEAKING ARABIC]
###44 
###47 -[SPEAKING ARABIC]
###49 
###57 SUROOSH ALVI: However, there wasn't a lot of concrete
###59 evidence supporting these stories.
###61 And some people thought that the case of these emo killings
###64 was just scare mongering to keep kids from
###67 straying from tradition.
###69 We went to meet with Dog Faced Corpse and Fatalogy, two local
###72 metal bands, to get their opinion on it.
###76 Oh, yeah.
###77 Great.
###78 Thanks buddy.
###79 Cheers.
###80 Shukran.
###82 So this emo story, is it like legit or is it bullshit?
###87 Did it actually happen?
###90 -It did not.
###90 -No, it's true, man.
###91 -It's true?
###92 -Yeah, it's true.
###92 SUROOSH ALVI: See?
###93 There's still like--
###95 Well, you're saying it happened, and you're saying it
###97 didn't.
###97 -Yeah, it's happening.
###98 -The media exaggerates the things.
###101 I think it's bullshit.
###102 I think it's bullshit.
###104 As you know, they think that emos are metal heads are
###109 satanists as this everything.
###113 [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###114 
###130 SUROOSH ALVI: So they had to turn the freezer off to plug
###133 in the amp.
###134 Across the street there's a religious cleric.
###137 It's the month of Muharram.
###138 And he gets pretty pissed off apparently.
###143 So yeah, they're a bit freaked out about playing right now.
###147 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###167 SUROOSH ALVI: Dog Faced Corpse, where does the name
###168 come from?
###169 -[SPEAKING ARABIC]
###170 
###191 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###200 -[SPEAKING ARABIC]
###201 
###210 -[SPEAKING ARABIC]
###211 
###224 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###233 -Sounds good?
###234 SUROOSH ALVI: Yeah, man.
###235 Thanks for doing that.
###236 I know that the religious cleric is probably not too
###238 happy right now.
###239 It's Muharram and everything.
###240 Or yeah, maybe he's out there.
###244 It was pretty clear that no matter what kind of music
###247 you're playing--
###247 rap, emo, metal, or even classical--
###251 you could get killed.
###252 But in terms of oppression, the group that has it the
###255 absolute worst is the gay community in Iraq.
###259 What is the situation like here for you?
###261 ALI AL-HAFEZ: [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###263 
###292 SUROOSH ALVI: During Saddam Hussein's time, you were
###294 persecuted for being gay.
###296 And now you live in fear of being persecuted as well.
###301 So it was bad before and it's still bad.
###303 ALI AL-HAFEZ: [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###304 
###320 These are my friends.
###322 [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###323 
###342 SUROOSH ALVI: That's you?
###342 ALI AL-HAFEZ: Yeah.
###343 SUROOSH ALVI: Yeah.
###343 That's a good look for you.
###344 
###347 ALI AL-HAFEZ: That's me.
###348 Sorry.
###348 Why?
###349 Excuse me, cat.
###352 SUROOSH ALVI: I assume it's a very underground kind of world
###355 that you have.
###356 ALI AL-HAFEZ: [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###357 
###399 SUROOSH ALVI: Even though they might be part of the same
###402 group that's persecuting you guys.
###404 ALI AL-HAFEZ: [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###405 SUROOSH ALVI: Wow.
###406 That's crazy.
###408 And are you getting help from the gay rights organizations
###412 in the West?
###413 No?
###414 Not yet?
###415 ALI AL-HAFEZ: [SPEAKING ARABIC]
