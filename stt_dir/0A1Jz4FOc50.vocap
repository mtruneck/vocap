###1 The Sudan, the largest
###3 country in Africa,
###4 lies where the Sahara Desert
###5 meets the grasslands of the Sahel.
###8 Its westernmost region is called Darfur.
###11 Though small compared to
###13 the rest of the Sudan,
###14 the three provinces that make up Darfur
###17 are nearly the size of France.
###22 Far from the capital in Khartourn,
###24 the region has been neglected for years
###26 by the government.
###28 Darfur means "Land of the Fur."
###32 A Muslim African tribe indigenous to the area.
###36 The region is inhabited by many tribes
###38 that are racially and culturally
###40 intertwined.
###41 But despite these cultural similarities,
###43 groups of farmers, who are viewed
###45 as African
###46 and groups of herders,
###48 who are considered Arab,
###50 have had clashes over the land for decades.
###52 Droughts,
###53 famines,
###54 desertification
###56 and population pressures
###57 have added to the rising tensions.
###61 Since 2003, rebel groups
###63 have fought against the government
###65 accusing it of supporting the Arab herders
###68 over the African farmers.
###72 The government's response caused a mass exodus
###74 forcing villagers to become refugees
###77 in their own homeland.
###80 In this United Nations refugee camp
###83 along the Chad-Sudan border,
###85 the women and children here have found a safe haven
###88 from the Janjawe, the armed militias
###90 of Arab herders organized by the government
###94 to fight the rebels and kill civilians.
###98 Entire villages have been burned.
###101 Hundreds of thousands have died.
###104 Beatings, rapes
###106 and mutilations are used as weapons of terror.
###110 Around 2 million people
###112 almost a third of Darfur's population
###115 have fled their villages.
###117 These refugees have lost everything.
###119 But they are the lucky ones.
###122 Most still wander the land unable to go home.
###125 Their lives still at risk.
###130 Though peace talks have been organized,
###132 the fighting still continues.
###135 And in Darfur the people are still dying.
