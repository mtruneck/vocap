not Larry.

that's his white name, bro.

VINNY DOTOLO: There's just a
certain philosophy here.


14
0:0:38,46 --> 0:0:41,39
It's like, everybody's always
looking for something to wow


15
0:0:41,39 --> 0:0:44,66
you here when they come here,
every time, everybody.


16
0:0:44,66 --> 0:0:47,935
It's a tight crew here, too--
small staff, small front of


17
0:0:47,935 --> 0:0:49,92
the house staff, small
back of the house.


18
0:0:49,92 --> 0:0:52,375

pretty good group of guys that

0:1:10,23 --> 0:1:11,51

He's a good friend of
ours, loves to eat.

He of course jumped in, hit up
a couple of his friends.

We had Zach McGowan,

33
0:1:23,967 --> 0:1:25,56
we met here at Animal.


34
0:1:25,56 --> 0:1:27,11

And of course, Jeff
from Thrillist--

more than any of us.

long fucking time.

0:1:43,6 --> 0:1:44,65
We're both from Florida.


42
0:1:44,65 --> 0:1:48,81
I grew up in Ormond Beach, he
grew up in Clearwater, and we


43
0:1:48,81 --> 0:1:50,18
met in culinary school.


44
0:1:50,18 --> 0:1:53,5
VINNY DOTOLO: I think the
restaurant was something we


45
0:1:53,5 --> 0:1:54,55
were dying to get back into.


46
0:1:54,55 --> 0:1:58,16
We had worked in some fine
dining restaurants our first


47
0:1:58,16 --> 0:2:1,82
couple years out of school, and
then kind of fell off and


48
0:2:1,82 --> 0:2:5,54
started catering and built our
business up from there.


49
0:2:5,54 --> 0:2:7,81
JON SHOOK: It's always been our
dream, I think, to have


50
0:2:7,81 --> 0:2:10,25
our own restaurant and be
a chef in a restaurant.


51
0:2:10,25 --> 0:2:12,95
We never were sous
chefs anywhere.

0:2:12,95 --> 0:2:17,94
We were line cooks, caterers,
business owners, and now,

we've dug our feet in.

VINNY DOTOLO: Yeah, the food
scene, I think, has really


57
0:2:26,96 --> 0:2:29,56
taken a turn in the last
five years here.


58
0:2:29,56 --> 0:2:32,3
There were some really solid
chefs here before.


59
0:2:32,3 --> 0:2:35,76
But now, it's a place where it
can be considered to be a


60
0:2:35,76 --> 0:2:38,67
culinary Mecca of the US.


61
0:2:38,67 --> 0:2:41,85
I don't know if the rest of the
US would agree with that.

that flag a little bit.

we first moved here.

that were coming with us, I

think it was a good idea
to bring them there.

interactive, and you're

funny because in press, too,

like, oh, this restaurant is

and there is pork.

0:4:24,3 --> 0:4:24,94
But I think it was--


114
0:4:24,94 --> 0:4:26,85
the bacon thing really got
people, because there's bacon

the menu that had bacon in

them, but it's not
the focus here.


118

bacon in our iced tea.

run within really tight

much Asian-inspired food.

fucking dollars.


201
0:7:3,494 --> 0:7:6,39
-I want to know how they
get this so red.


202
0:7:6,39 --> 0:7:7,2
JON SHOOK: It's pigeon.


203
0:7:7,2 --> 0:7:7,8
-What is that?


204
0:7:7,8 --> 0:7:9,99
How do they do that?


205
0:7:9,99 --> 0:7:11,752
JON SHOOK: You guys, we're
eating pigeon.


206
0:7:11,752 --> 0:7:12,96
-I don't have a problem
with that.


207
0:7:12,96 --> 0:7:14,29
JON SHOOK: Look--


208
0:7:14,29 --> 0:7:16,139
-That's so gnarly, dude.


209
0:7:16,139 --> 0:7:17,62
-Pigeon's good, dude.


210
0:7:17,62 --> 0:7:18,87
JON SHOOK: Let's get the
fuck to the next place.


211
0:7:18,87 --> 0:7:21,68



212
0:7:21,68 --> 0:7:23,49
ZACH MCGOWAN: What's next
up on the menu?


213
0:7:23,49 --> 0:7:26,23
VINNY DOTOLO: I think
some taco truck


214
0:7:26,23 --> 0:7:27,76
Johnny's got lined up.


215
0:7:27,76 --> 0:7:31,65
JON SHOOK: See, we figured that
we might as well also try


216
0:7:31,65 --> 0:7:35,22
to hit a couple taco trucks when
we're out on the street.


217
0:7:35,22 --> 0:7:36,277
[CAR HORN]


218
0:7:36,277 --> 0:7:39,94
-Whoa, oh my god, oh my god.


219
0:7:39,94 --> 0:7:41,636
GIOVANNI REDA: Yo, you should
have fucking ran that


220
0:7:41,636 --> 0:7:42,886
piece of shit over.


221
0:7:42,886 --> 0:7:45,83



222
0:7:45,83 --> 0:7:48,8
Yo, we're trying to find
a taco truck right now.


223
0:7:48,8 --> 0:7:50,15
You're going to let some little
car get in our way of a


224
0:7:50,15 --> 0:7:51,4
taco truck?


225
0:7:51,4 --> 0:8:0,309



226
0:8:0,309 --> 0:8:2,97
TOMMY: Call them now and tell
them to heat up the donuts.


227
0:8:2,97 --> 0:8:4,12
-Whoa, look out for this taxi.


228
0:8:4,12 --> 0:8:5,83
Time to make the donuts.


229
0:8:5,83 --> 0:8:9,515



230
0:8:9,515 --> 0:8:12,92
JON SHOOK: We decided to stop
back at the restaurant, too,


231
0:8:12,92 --> 0:8:13,7
for a donut.


232
0:8:13,7 --> 0:8:16,22
Donuts are almost out
of season here,


233
0:8:16,22 --> 0:8:16,86
believe it or not.


234
0:8:16,86 --> 0:8:20,49
Because donuts only really work
when the temperature's


235
0:8:20,49 --> 0:8:21,56
right here in LA.


236
0:8:21,56 --> 0:8:25,1
Yeah, I'd say we'll probably
only have another month or two


237
0:8:25,1 --> 0:8:26,804
left on the donuts.


238
0:8:26,804 --> 0:8:29,49
And then they'll be done.


239
0:8:29,49 --> 0:8:30,75
-Oh, my stomach's on fire.


240
0:8:30,75 --> 0:8:32,33
JON SHOOK: Yep, mine is too.


241
0:8:32,33 --> 0:8:34,799
I got a good case of bubble
gut right now.


242
0:8:34,799 --> 0:8:35,601
GIOVANNI REDA: You know what's
good to put the fire out in


243
0:8:35,601 --> 0:8:36,1
your stomach.


244
0:8:36,1 --> 0:8:36,835
JON SHOOK: PediaSure.


245
0:8:36,835 --> 0:8:38,37
GIOVANNI REDA: A donut.


246
0:8:38,37 --> 0:8:40,309
-This is what we do in
Hollywood, kids.


247
0:8:40,309 --> 0:8:42,335
We drive around and binge eat.


248
0:8:42,335 --> 0:8:49,6



249
0:8:49,6 --> 0:8:51,9
VINNY DOTOLO: I think there's
many things that come into


250
0:8:51,9 --> 0:8:53,65
play in why it's so busy.


251
0:8:53,65 --> 0:8:55,53
I think the food speaks
for itself, you know?


252
0:8:55,53 --> 0:8:57,34
Obviously you can tell by
looking around, there's not


253
0:8:57,34 --> 0:8:58,9
much decor here--


254
0:8:58,9 --> 0:9:0,47
it's not really that
bringing you in.


255
0:9:0,47 --> 0:9:2,1
It's not the music, you
know what I mean?


256
0:9:2,1 --> 0:9:6,27
It's just not that type of LA
quintessential restaurant


257
0:9:6,27 --> 0:9:8,53
where people are doing
coke in the bathroom.


258
0:9:8,53 --> 0:9:10,75
They might be doing it,
but people are here to


259
0:9:10,75 --> 0:9:12,63
eat, so I doubt it.


260
0:9:12,63 --> 0:9:15,65
GIOVANNI REDA: I'm going
for the fork.


261
0:9:15,65 --> 0:9:16,94
VINNY DOTOLO: We only had
a short amount of


262
0:9:16,94 --> 0:9:17,87
time to hang out.


263
0:9:17,87 --> 0:9:20,6
And we were just trying to get
as many new experiences for


264
0:9:20,6 --> 0:9:23,6
everyone tied into one
night, and I think we


265
0:9:23,6 --> 0:9:26,58
accomplished that.


266
0:9:26,58 --> 0:9:28,22
JON SHOOK: I think as
much we love cooking


267
0:9:28,22 --> 0:9:30,34
we also love eating--


268
0:9:30,34 --> 0:9:31,26
big time.


269
0:9:31,26 --> 0:9:34,92
Eating's I guess a reward
for all the work, right?
