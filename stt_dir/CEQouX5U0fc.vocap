###7 The universe has long captivated us with its immense scales of distance and time.
###14 How far does it stretch? Where does it end... and what lies beyond its star fields... and
###25 streams of galaxies extending as far as telescopes can see?
###33 These questions are beginning to yield to a series of extraordinary new lines of investigation...
###39 and technologies that are letting us to peer into the most distant realms of the cosmos...
###44 But also at the behavior of matter and energy on the smallest of scales.
###52 Remarkably, our growing understanding of this kingdom of the ultra-tiny, inside the nuclei
###56 of atoms, permits us to glimpse the largest vistas of space and time.
###66 In ancient times, most observers saw the stars as a sphere surrounding the earth, often the
###81 home of deities.
###85 The Greeks were the first to see celestial events as phenomena, subject to human investigation...
###92 rather than the fickle whims of the Gods.
###97 One sky-watcher, for example, suggested that meteors are made of materials found on Earth...
###104 and might have even come from the Earth.
###109 Those early astronomers built the foundations of modern science. But they would be shocked
###116 to see the discoveries made by their counterparts today.
###123 The stars and planets that once harbored the gods are now seen as infinitesimal parts of
###129 a vast scaffolding of matter and energy extending far out into space.
###141 Just how far... began to emerge in the 1920s.
###145 Working at the huge new 100-inch Hooker Telescope on California's Mt. Wilson,
###150 astronomer Edwin Hubble, along with his assistant named Milt Humason, analyzed the light of
###155 fuzzy patches of sky... known then as nebulae.
###158 They showed that these were actually distant galaxies far beyond our own.
###164 Hubble and Humason discovered that most of them are moving away from us. The farther
###169 out they looked, the faster they were receding.
###173 This fact, now known as Hubble's law, suggests that there must have been a time when the
###182 matter in all these galaxies was together in one place.
###188 That time... when our universe sprung forth... has come to be called the Big Bang.
###197 How large the cosmos has gotten since then depends on how long its been growing... and
###204 its expansion rate.
###206 Recent precision measurements gathered by the Hubble space telescope and other instruments
###212 have brought a consensus...
###214 That the universe dates back 13.7 billion years.
###216 Its radius, then, is the distance a beam of light would have traveled in that time ...
###227  13.7 billion light years.
###230 That works out to about 1.3 quadrillion kilometers.
###232 In fact, it's even bigger.... Much bigger. How it got so large, so fast, was until recently
###239 a deep mystery.
###240 That the universe could expand had been predicted back in 1917 by Albert Einstein, except that
###250 Einstein himself didn't believe it...
###252 until he saw Hubble and Humason's evidence.
###256 Einstein's general theory of relativity suggested that galaxies could be moving apart because
###261 space itself is expanding.
###263 So when a photon gets blasted out from a distant star, it moves through a cosmic landscape
###269 that is getting larger and larger, increasing the distance it must travel to reach us.
###274 In 1995, the orbiting telescope named for Edwin Hubble began to take the measure of
###282 the universe... by looking for the most distant galaxies it could see.
###291 Taking the expansion of the universe into account, the space telescope found galaxies
###296 that are now almost 46 billion light years away from us in each direction... and almost
###302 92 billion light years from each other.
###305 And that would be the whole universe... according to a straightforward model of the big bang.
###310 But remarkably, that might be a mere speck within the universe as a whole, according
###317 to a dramatic new theory that describes the origins of the cosmos.
###321 It's based on the discovery that energy is constantly welling up from the vacuum of space
###328 in the form of particles of opposite charge... matter and anti-matter.
###332 Back in the 1980s, the physicist Alan Guth proposed that energy fields embedded in the
###340 vacuum of space suddenly tipped into a higher energy state...
###345 causing space and time to literally "inflate"...
###349 ...to go from atomic size... to cosmological size within an infinitesimally short time.
###359 As a result, according to one calculation, the universe as a whole...
###363 ...would have grown to some ten billion trillion times the size of the observable universe.
###369 That's ten followed by 24 zeroes.
###372 Put another way, the complete universe is to the observable universe... as the observable
###380 universe is... to an atom.
###386 The fury of this period of cosmic inflation helps explain the immense size and smoothness
###392 of the universe.
###393 But to succeed, the theory must also account for how the universe produced what we see
###399 around us... all those stars and galaxies and clusters of galaxies, and ultimately...
###407 us.
###411 Scientists are now seeking to piece together the chain of events that launched our universe
###415 in its earliest moments... by generating what you might call a "little bang."
###420 At the Brookhaven National Lab in New York State, they are blasting gold atoms in opposite
###430 directions down tunnels almost two and a half miles long.
###434 When these atoms reach velocities just short of the speed of light, they are sent into
###439 a violent collision.
###442 A fireball erupts... reaching a temperature exceeding two trillion degrees Centigrade.
###447 As far as we know, the last time anything in our universe was that hot was about a millionth
###454 of a second after its birth.
###457 What interests the scientists is the splatter of subatomic particles... a super-hot soup
###464 of quarks and gluons... particles that gave rise to matter as we know it.
###471 In initial tests, this quark-gluon plasma has shown a crucial property... extremely
###477 low viscosity or resistance to flow. Scientists call this a perfect liquid.
###483 To grasp its importance, we go back to those primordial energy fields that the theory says
###489 spawned the big bang.
###493 The thinking is that those fields contained tiny fluctuations that were blown up to huge
###498 size during inflation.
###499 In the ultra-dense quark-gluon mix, these fluctuations generated pressure waves, or
###515 ripples. As the universe evolved, these ripples led to variations in the density of matter.
###523 Amazingly, the imprint of those primordial ripples is out there today... first seen in
###528 a faint signal discovered accidentally back in the 1960s.
###533 Working for the Bell Telephone Company, physicists Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson had built a
###539 giant horn-shaped antenna.
###540 But wherever they pointed, the contraption picked up excessive noise in the microwave
###546 portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.
###548 That noise turned out to match a prediction made years earlier...
###553 That in the wake of the big bang, the universe was filled with a cloud of extremely hot gas
###562 that scattered all light.
###563 As the universe cooled, the cloud dissipated. Light then shone through.
###570 Over time it shifted... as the universe expanded and cooled... to just the noise signature
###577 detected by Penzias and Wilson. What they'd heard was the echo of the Big Bang.
###586 This image shows the smooth contours of the light recorded by the Bell team. Scientists
###592 would have to look closer... to find the imprint of cosmic inflation.
###600 The Space Shuttle Discovery lifted the Hubble Space Telescope into orbit on April 24, 1990...
###607 in one of the most important scientific milestones our time.
###612 Another launch, arguably just as important, took place five months earlier.
###617 This was the Cosmic Observation Background Explorer, COBE for short, was sent up to take
###625 a harder look at the microwave radiation discovered by Penzias and Wilson.
###630 The results came out two and a half years later. The early universe contained a pattern
###636 of hot and cold spots.
###639 One COBE scientist called it the fingerprint of creation... for it showed the origin of
###645 the universe we see around us today... smooth on a large scale, but with significant clumps...
###652 ...from which gravity would form gas clouds, then stars, and galaxies.
###663 With this cosmic template in hand, astronomers set out to discover how the patterns and the
###668 dimensions of the universe evolved over time.
###670 In an age of computer controlled telescopes and automated observing, astronomers could
###678 now launch huge international collaborations with the goal of mapping a large fraction
###684 of the universe in three dimensions.
###688 At Apache Point in New Mexico, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey set the standard for mass production
###695 astronomy.
###696 A series of steel plates are drilled with holes that exactly match the location of galaxies
###702 in the night sky.
###704 After plugging fiber optic sensors into the holes, the plates capture the light of hundreds
###709 of galaxies per night, and that light determines their distances from Earth.
###715 Another survey is named the 2 Micron All Sky Survey, or 2Mass, after the frequency of infrared
###726 light its detectors are tuned to capture.
###730 Here, these data go out to a region 60 million light years across. You can see the local
###735 group of galaxies, dominated by Andromeda and the Milky Way in the center. This is our
###736 neighborhood.
###739 Jump further out to a region about 200 million light years across.
###743 Our galactic neighborhood merges into the densely packed Virgo Supercluster... which
###749 is the nearest intergalactic city.
###753 Stepping out to a region over 320 million light years across, you can see the full breadth
###758 of our local region of the universe.
###758 Galaxies line up in walls and arcs... that bound an array of sparsely-populated voids...
###764 the rural cosmic countryside.
###769 Moving out with the data... this region is over 650 million light years across...
###775 Then almost two billion...
###775 3.2 billion...
###775 And finally out to a region 6.5 billion light years from end to end: the cosmic continent.
###784 In the middle of it all, our galaxy, so immense from our Earthly perspective, is less than
###789 a speck.
###790 The 2mass study, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and the 2 Degree Field in Australia have extended
###801 our maps to a quarter of the way back to the beginning of the universe.
###804 They have laid out a grand cosmic roadmap... and gravitational routes.
###813 Now COBE's successor, the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe, or "WMAP", was ready to
###823 scan the early universe for the fine-scale origins of this cosmic atlas.
###828 WMAP was launched beyond any interference from Earth... to a position balanced between
###834 the Earth and the Sun.
###836 There, for two years, its detectors took in the pristine light of deep space.
###846 This is what WMAP saw... a pattern consistent with the filaments and voids that had evolved
###852 in the universe at large... and with the tiny-scale structures sketched by inflation at the very
###858 birth of the cosmos.
###859 Scientists at Brookhaven National Lab in the U.S. and the new Large Hadron Collider in
###867 Europe will be probing ultra high-energy collisions in the coming years to tease out more details
###874 of the early universe.
###875 Others are poring over the WMAP data for evidence of its true dimensions.
###878 One group looked for repeating patterns that could be evidence of pressure waves that might
###882 have ricocheted through the hot gas of early times.
###885 They saw none...which implies that the universe had grown so large during inflation that such
###892 waves could not cross it.
###893 Then they did the math... the entire universe has a minimum diameter of 156 billion light
###901 years... not quite twice the size of everything out there that we can see: the "observable"
###907 universe.
###909 What is its maximum size... and what's beyond that?
###918 We will never know for sure what lies beyond our visual horizon... but astronomers are
###924 turning up some surprising hints... in the universe they can see.
###933 To ancient observers, the universe was made of five classical elements... Earth, Water,
###939 Air, Fire...
###941 and a fifth: Quintessence... or space.
###948 Aristotle believed the stars, unchanging and incorruptible, were made of this fifth element.
###957 Today, we are finding that space, in fact, has a character of its own.
###962 Astronomers have calculated the gravitational pull needed to bind stars as they orbit a
###967 galaxy... or galaxies as they orbit a cluster of galaxies.
###973 They have found that there is simply nowhere near enough visible matter there to hold these
###980 structures together.
###981 The missing ingredient, its identity still unknown, they call: Dark Matter.
###988 In supercomputer simulations of cosmic evolution, dark matter is added in to supply the gravitational
###995 tug needed to form the web pattern of filaments and walls;
###999 voids and dense clusters we see in the universe at large.
###1004 But something else appears to be happening on these large scales.
###1010 Astronomers have been making refined measurements of the cosmic expansion rate with a new type
###1015 of distance marker.
###1017 They wanted to know if gravity was slowing down the pace at which the universe is spreading
###1022 out.
###1022 But what they've found comes as a shock:
###1025 The markers they use, type IA supernovae, are thought to burn at uniform intensities
###1033 throughout the universe.
###1034 By measuring changes in the brightness of these so-called standard candles at various
###1042 distances, the researchers have been hunting for changes in the rate at which the Cosmos
###1047 is expanding.
###1047 They have shown that while local regions or the universe are drawing together, the universe
###1056 as a whole is not only expanding, it's accelerating outward!
###1063 The culprit is thought to be energy welling up from the vacuum of space... similar to
###1068 what occurred in the early moments of the Big Bang, causing cosmic inflation.
###1074 Now it's happening in minute quantities across vast regions.
###1079 Over time, this so-called "Dark Energy" has grown to an astonishing three-fourths of all
###1086 the matter and energy in the universe.
###1089 With data like this pointing to an underlying dynamic within our universe, some scientists
###1094 have suggested its part of an even larger cosmic dynamic... much broader and deeper
###1101 than we've ever thought.
###1104 There is a version of inflationary theory that suggests we live in one of many universes....co-existing
###1110 side by side but out of touch with one another.
###1117 Like bubbles, they are continually rising up... and expanding across the oceans of infinity.
###1126 Just 500 years ago many people looked out into space and saw a universe of lights...
###1132 small and nearby... centered on the Earth.
###1136 The birth of astronomy revealed stars far from our planet...
###1142 Galaxies... clusters of galaxies... then vast walls and filaments of matter.
###1149 Newer ideas about the size of the universe amount to a quantum leap in our sense of scale,
###1154 by extending these structures far, far beyond our horizon.
###1162 Do these discoveries push us, on our tiny out-of-the-way planet, into a smaller and
###1169 smaller corner of Creation?
###1176 Or does our ability to comprehend and imagine the far limits of time and space expand our
###1183 importance... in the grand scheme of things?
