###3 So I've done a little work on looking at dealmakers and I wanted
###6 to understand kind of the nature of networking and the new frontiers
###9 that I think are coming between applying network theory and understanding
###13 the structure of social capital and understanding innovation from
###16 the standpoint of how firms ultimately take route.
###20 And I did little work on this and it occurred to me
###22 in the academic literature there was a real clear
###24 distinction between entrepreneurs and investors.
###27 Never understood that distinction because the successful
###29 entrepreneurs I knew were investors, right.
###32 There is no clear bright line between those two.
###35 So I always wondered there was these other people up there
###37 that kind of fuse those two concepts and they tended to
###39 be the people that made more and more things happen.
###42 You might have started as an entrepreneur,
###43 might have started as an investor but you become something else.
###47 I don't know, for the lack of a better word,
###48 I am looking for a better word for those
###49 of you trying to think about this.
###51 The dealmakers, the people that actually make things happen.
###55 And I tried to understand that.
###56 They broker resources,
###57 they shape your networks and they syndicate and interconnect, right.
###61 It occurs to me that there are these people in the
###62 center that activate the rest of the network, when it works, right.
###66 And these are the people that I was starting to get interested in.
###69 I remember about five years ago when the
###70 economy was starting to climb to a halt,
###72 it was grinding to a halt, I wanted to get something going.
###76 And I was thinking to myself who do we need.
###79 We need the people who have done it repeatedly.
###81 We might call them serial entrepreneurs,
###83 you might call them the people who ultimately
###85 broker deals or what have you.
###87 These are the individuals that are going to help us make a heaven.
###90 For some reason, they're frozen. They are not doing it anymore.
###92 Why is that? They're living in kind of a fear.
###95 So I said, let's figure out something, so I developed this algorithm,
###99 I guess, it's for lack of - it's a vaunted
###101 term to call it an algorithm.
###102 The truth of the matter is, I'm looking for people who have multiple
###105 positions in entrepreneurial firms, I'm actually stacking them up,
###109 and then I relate them socially to try to understand
###111 how they're connected to one another.
###113 Because I want you as young entrepreneurs to be able to access them,
###116 right, because that's how you're going to be successful.
###119 So finding out who the who is.
###121 The way I do that is I try to understand the entrepreneurs
###124 and investors and generally there are distinctions
###125 bringing those two types of people.
###126 But as they move up in their career, they have two equity positions,
###131 three equity positions, four equity positions in firms,
###133 they become more and more important in seeing
###136 the network kind of come to life, right.
###139 So I'm looking at actors within firms,
###141 within regions using interlocks, very interested in this.
###144 It occurred to me, I looked at all the tech hotspots and
###147 back in the '80s we actually had a whole set of theories
###150 where if we brought all the technologies together,
###152 entrepreneurship would happen, right.
###154 And this is a chart that shows the number of firms born
###157 and it was fascinating to me that when I looked at it,
###159 Silicon Valley created almost 5,000
###161 firms over a 20 year period whereas Boston created about
###164 half that even though in most cases you're equating Silicon
###167 Valley and Boston as equal parties in entrepreneurship.
###171 All these other technology regions including my region,
###173 Research Triangle Park, created less than 1,000, right.
###177 Ironically where I come from Research Triangle Park has the highest
###179 density of PhDs over total employees of anywhere in the world.
###184 Yet, they're not creating that many companies.
###185 So I was trying to figure that out.
###188 When I looked at these patterns,
###190 these are the number of equity positions
###191 held and you see the numbers on the left, 1 all the way to 30,
###195 these are the equity positions by each of these regions.
###197 And I noticed there was a big fat base
###200 wherever there was nice economies,
###202 where Silicon Valley was performing
###204 so well in creating great companies,
###206 had a lot of entrepreneurs and investors engaged in it.
###208 Okay, we already kind of knew that,
###210 but the other pattern I saw on the data that I thought was really
###212 interesting was there was a really nice fat long tail.
###215 There were a lot of people who did a lot of things, right.
###218 Whereas these other regions you never saw those people, right.
###222 So I started to look at the relationship of dealmakers to the
###226 performance of regions by way of creating new companies.
###229 And I founded as a matter of fact,
###232 statistically the presence of dealmakers was actually
###235 more correlated to firm birth than the frequency of
###240 the availability of entrepreneurs and investors.
###242 So what does it tell you? It occurs to me, that these people are
###246 usually in the elite, the top 2.7%,
###249 these are people who have three or more equity
###252 positions in entrepreneurial firms.
###254 And in places like the Bay Area, it's 4.5%
###257 of the population, whereas places like Austin,
###260 Texas or Denver, it's around 1%, right.
###264 So something is in the water here, right.
###267 It occurs to me, these are the people.
###268 Well I wanted to map the networks and these are
###270 the networks of these 12 technology hotspots,
###272 as a matter of fact they're organized by population,
###275 so the most populous is Boston, the least populous is Austin,
###278 the lower right hand side.
###279 If it varied by population,
###281 you would expect to see the most dense to the least dense, correct?
###284 What do you see in the pattern of this data?
###287 You see the most dense or the most intense
###292 entrepreneurial network in Silicon Valley.
###294 The third greatest - largest metropolitan area up here
###297 Phoenix has the weakest entrepreneurial network.
###299 I was talking to Michael Crow,
###301 the Chancellor of Arizona State University,
###302 shown this data, and he said Zoller, how many people are up there?
###304 And I said about 150 and he said, I'll just have them over the house.
###309 I want to talk to these guys.
###311 Well, in places like RTP or Austin or places like that,
###314 they hang in there even though they're small places.
###317 Please, question?
###319 Okay, the data comes ultimately from private transaction data.
###324 It comes from public databases, like Standard & Poor's.
###328 And I came up with the software to actually put all
###331 the data together and then socially relate it.
###334 Well, what was fascinating is,
###336 this is the aggregate network of entrepreneurs
###339 in each of these regions. What does that tell you?
###340 What two regions other than Silicon Valley and Boston would you
###343 say are starting to look like hot entrepreneurial networks?
###347 San Diego. San Diego and Seattle, right.
###349 Now I'm leaving out some obvious cities because
###352 these are technology hotspots, right?
###354 Leaving out some of the key metropolitan areas
###356 like Los Angeles or New York or Chicago, starting to study those.
###360 What's ironic is many of those cities because they're
###362 financial headquarters tend not to be entrepreneurial.
###365 But you know the stories that are evolving.
###368 The Groupon founders are really driving an
###370 entrepreneurial revolution in Chicago.
###372 Have you all noticed what's happening in New York lately,
###375 across the bridge in Brooklyn?
###377 It's unbelievable, there's an entrepreneurial
###378 revolution going on there.
###380 But the aggregate networks are just one story.
###382 I want to know where the dealmakers are? Well, check this out.
###385 When you screen the aggregate network
###387 for three or more equity positions, this is the picture you get.
###391 Silicon Valley, you would still need the Stanford
###393 Football Stadium to have everybody there, right.
###395 Boston, you could probably fit them in the Stanford Basketball Arena.
###399 Whereas in Austin, you could probably get them in this room, right.
###403 In Phoenix, you could probably get them in
###405 the classroom we're going next, right.
###407 When you go to four plus dealmakers look at this.
###410 You would still need the basketball stadium
###413 here in time for Silicon Valley,
###415 whereas in Boston you could probably get them in this room.
###418 And the people in Phoenix,
###419 you could probably get them in the front row,
###421 pretty interesting, isn't it?
###423 Things aren't all equal when we are looking
###425 at the performance of regions.
