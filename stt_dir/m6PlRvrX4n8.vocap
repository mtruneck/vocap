###157 Thought you'd called it a night.
###158 No way. You know me, I'm one of the original 24-hour party people!
###163 What's up?
###165 See anything wrong with this picture?
###168 What picture?
###171 Jesus, babe, we're different from them. So what?
###175 "Different" doesn't last. "The same" lasts.
###178 It's all about you and me, remember? Fuck the rest.
###182 C'mon, are you up for some more?
###184 God, yeah!
###186 D'you know what? On second thoughts...
###188 You've just had a couple of lines and a pill.
###190 Baking soda. Aspirin. Let's go home.
###192 OK, if that's what you want.
###234 Southern Cemetery then a memorial lunch at the Midland. Could be nice.
###239 No, we're going to St Pat's, and that's the end of it.
###242 The shortest mass in Manchester.
###244 Like fucking vultures, you two. The Funeral Crashers.
###248 It's a social responsibility.
###249 It's a free lunch.
###250 It's a buzz. You never know what's going to happen at a funeral...
###255 all that pent-up frustration and years of resentment and bitterness,
###260 the Yin and Yang of familial love and hate.
###263 You're very strange, Mrs Croker, if you don't mind me saying.
###266 I consider it a compliment.
###268 Looking well, both.
###272 Thank you.
###273 Considering.
###274 Yeah, Lillian, we get the message.
###276 Time to make tracks. Got to get there early if we want a decent seat.
###280 She's keen.
###281 The deceased was a close personal friend.
###283 Whatever you say.
###288 What's up with your face?
###291 Everyone keeps banging on about how well we're doing.
###293 Well, we are.
###299 There you go.
###300 You said it'd take years off.
###302 Er, hairdresser, not a supplier of miracles.
###306 Could get a little work done. Not uncommon these days.
###309 Upstairs or down?
###311 Er, downstairs is as good as new, thank you very much.
###315 Me and me mister are hand in glove.
###318 I only ask cos the older woman sometimes has a lift down below.
###322 Tightens things up for the new tenant.
###324 Demi, our Babs, Liz Taylor... You've gotta love the Cougars.
###328 You mean all those girls had the...
###330 God, no! Liz couldn't, not with her back.
###333 And the fact she is dead.
###334 Oh, sorry, and there is that.
###336 And when they did Joany,
###338 they made a little person from the excess,
###341 and that's how we've got Simon Cowell.
###344 What d'you think I'd need?
###346 A head transplant.
###347 Enough with the fucking wisecracks. I'm serious here.
###352 About cosmetic surgery? You're in your prime, Meems.
###356 I'm gonna lose him.
###358 Maybe not now, but sometime.
###361 What's he done?
###361 Who?
###362 Billy. Nothing!
###364 If that little fucker is dipping his wick, I'll...
###366 He isn't. He hasn't done anything.
###369 It's not him, it's me.
###372 I can't be everything he needs.
###380 These sandwiches taste of feet.
###383 Anyone for a top-up?
###384 Oh, no, thank you. No, I really couldn't.
###388 Any more sherry, I'll be shitting doilies.
###391 I'll have some.
###396 Incoming at nine o'clock.
###397 Insurance salesman, I'm thinking, or ambulance chaser.
###401 We might get a free pen.
###404 Afternoon, ladies. Thank you for coming.
###406 Wouldn't miss it for the world.
###407 Indeed.
###408 Did you know Irene well?
###410 Oh, very close, we were, at one time.
###413 Who's Irene?
###414 The lady who passed away so tragically.
###421 So, when were you close?
###422 Back in the day, in the '60s.
###424 Too long ago to remember.
###425 No, please, do try. It's wonderful meeting people who knew my mum.
###431 Your mum?
###433 Oh, well...
###435 Er, she loved travel, your mother.
###438 She did, especially in the '60s.
###440 We travelled together...
###442 all over,
###444 across Europe, North America...
###447 I hope you don't mind,
###449 but since we only brought my mother back from Austria yesterday,
###453 would you mind saying a few words?
###454 No! That's something you should do, surely.
###459 Well, she left when I was two. She only got back in touch last year.
###463 Someone like you could say so much more.
###467 Oh!
###470 Thanks.
###473 MIC FEEDS BACK
###480 I knew Irene, of course.
###482 (LAUGHS) Why wouldn't I?
###486 A kind woman.
###488 A good woman.
###491 Churchgoing till the end.
###497 Jewish, of course, which is still a religion.
###505 We were together at...
###510 the Prague Spring.
###512 Oh, yes, facing down the might of the Soviet Empire.
###520 And then, of course...
###522 there was Woodstock!
###524 GENIAL LAUGHTER
###542 Mm, summat smells good!
###544 Your favourite.
###545 Shepherd's pie?
###547 Your second-favourite.
###550 Oh, curry!
###551 Pizza.
###552 Sweet.
###557 I thought we could have a quiet night in, the two of us and a film.
###562 (LAUGHS)
###565 I thought you were being serious for a minute.
###566 I am.
###570 Oh, right. Yeah, I'd love to.
###572 Can I ask you something?
###573 Fire away.
###574 What's your favourite book?
###577 Batman.
###579 If there was an election tomorrow, who would you vote for?
###581 Nobody. Politics is boring.
###584 World events, and stuff?
###586 Makes me sleepy. I don't care.
###589 Oh, there's a dubstep all-nighter on in town. I said we might go.
###593 You could go on your own. We don't have to do everything together.
###596 But you said that's the secret to a happy relationship.
###600 Maybe I was wrong.
###602 Go out, have a great time.
###626 Sorry. Did I wake you?
###627 No.
###629 Couldn't sleep.
###630 Is everything all right?
###632 Just me mind working overtime.
###635 Did you get off with anyone?
###636 What?!
###638 No, course not. Did you?
###640 No!
###641 Kiss anyone?
###642 Fuck off. I wouldn't look at anyone!
###645 I think it's about time you did.
###647 What?!
###660 I'll keep it safe until your dad comes back for it, yeah?
###663 No worries.
###667 Forty quid by the end of the week or it'll be on eBay, understand?
###669 Sorted.
###673 So this friend...
###674 Of a friend.
###675 Friend of a friend.
###677 She wants him to shag around, tells him to go for it?
###679 Yeah.
###680 It's every man's dream, innit, having a bird pushing him
###684 to spread his seed? Fuck, tell him to fill his boots!
###698 Of course, it means she's splitting up with him.
###701 No, she wants them to stay together.
###703 She's dumping him. If your mate can't see that, he's a muppet.
###706 Either that or she's already doing someone herself.
###720 And the woman said, "Shall I get you a priest?"
###721 The little lad, wiping away his tears says,
###723 "No! Sex is the last thing on my mind!"
###731 I hope that's a fucking money tree. We could do wi' one!
###734 It's a cherry. I thought we could plant it together in memory of...
###741 We'd have somewhere we could go to think of her.
###744 Oh, for fuck's sake.
###752 There's your pal's lad.
###753 Oh, crap.
###755 Hello, ladies, I hope you don't mind. I tried a few places.
###760 Nice work, Sherlock.
###762 It's just... I've so many questions about my mother.
###766 My memory's not what it was.
###768 Any scraps from the table.
###769 From what I can gather, she did do Paul McCartney,
###772 but Bobby Charlton is just a rumour.
###778 A bottle of pale ale as well. That's really good.
###780 And it's good for you, full of iron.
###784 I'm not sure.
###785 I didn't like it at first...
###786 Fuck's going on?!
###787 All right, Billy?
###788 Is it him? Are you doing him? Is that what this is about?
###790 What are you on about?
###791 I'm not fucking having it!
###793 Calm yourself, fella.
###794 Aaah! Fuck, I think I've broke me hand!
###797 Are you all right?
###798 Stop talking to him!
###799 Shut the fuck up, you, you're an embarrassment.
###803 I'm so sorry about this.
###817 I'm only trying to do what's right, you know.
###820 I can't pretend it never happened.
###822 And I won't live every day like it just has.
###830 Where the fuck are you going?!
###837 I was saving stuff, putting a little bit aside,
###843 ever since the first scan.
###850 Nicked some copper wire from Maine Road for this... and the snow suit.
###856 It's beautiful stuff.
###859 Quality gear. We could sell it?
###860 It's got to be a hundred quid's worth.
###862 It's a night out at the very least!
###875 I can't tell you what a tonic this is.
###879 Yes.
###880 You see, I always hated her for abandoning us,
###882 for what she did to my father... but you paint a picture of a woman
###887 who was living life to the full.
###890 I really do now have to be going. Thank you, goodbye.
###897 It makes me feel somehow better about it...
###900 inheriting money from a woman I barely knew,
###902 a houseful of possessions...
###907 Perhaps I could stay for just one more.
###911 There's so much to tell.
###919 Does that make you feel better?
###924 What goes on in your head?
###927 Are you having an affair? D'you want shot of me?
###930 No. And no.
###933 What's going on, then?
###939 I'm struggling to see the common ground, baby. It worries me.
###942 Common ground?
###944 I mean like...
###945 I know what it means.
###946 I like Batman, I like all graphic novels. They're... works of art.
###951 And I wouldn't vote in the election cos politics is bollocks.
###955 It's all bought and paid for in advance.
###958 You vote for whatever cunt offends you least.
###961 You think you'd married a gimp or summat?
###965 I'm sorry if I offended you. Doesn't change the problem, though.
###974 I'm going for a drink... on my own.
###996 Marty?
###997 I don't want another baby wearing this stuff...
###1004 Sorry...
###1006 I just blurted it out.
###1009 I thought a night out would do us good.
###1011 I'll get a sub off Lillian, that'll see us right.
###1026 Compliments on a postcard, please, ladies.
###1032 You don't think it's a bit OTT for a job interview, I mean, at your age?
###1037 Making the most of her assets. Your dad's not earning,
###1039 so it's down to your mum to bring in the bacon.
###1043 I am stuffed into this. Too much...?
###1045 Not enough, in my humble. Designed to hypnotise, cleavage...
###1051 it's what God intended.
###1054 Too low?
###1055 If I was a fella...
###1057 I'd ride you. Don't know if I'd give you a job,
###1060 but I would definitely ride you.
###1067 What are you so nervous about?
###1069 I hate job interviews. I get all sweaty, I crumble.
###1072 You're smart.
###1074 Not when people are judging me, looking at me.
###1076 Hate it, always have done.
###1079 Right. What's the damage?
###1081 Oh, it'll save until you get your first pay packet.
###1084 You'll do it just like this tomorrow?
###1085 I'll have you skipping down the street to that interview,
###1088 looking a million dollars.
###1090 Right! Best get out of this, hang it up.
###1094 Get off!
###1122 Some guys don't like how their missus looks in the morning,
###1127 but I love it ... little puffy eyes, adjusting, like a little chipmunk.
###1130 I can suck a banana right out of its skin, no hands.
###1136 Hello, Daddy.
###1138 She was dry-humping him like a horny schoolie!
###1142 She is a horny schoolie!
###1143 Is there any other kind?
###1144 I don't see what's so funny here.
###1147 Your brand-new out-of-the-box husband
###1150 was firing into another woman.
###1152 I told him to.
###1153 I was gonna take a fucking drill to his head,
###1157 but I thought, "No, you know what?
###1159 "You might want..." What did you just say?
###1161 I told him to. It was my idea.
###1164 It's true, I don't understand either,
###1166 so don't ask. I don't want it.
###1169 I want us to see other people. I want an open relationship.
###1173 It's not right.
###1175 It's disgusting.
###1177 I think it's a great idea.
###1180 Excellent, enter the Daily fucking Bugle.
###1183 Don't it make you feel guilty about what you're doing?
###1186 Not a bit. I've earned it.
###1189 You're taking his inheritance off him.
###1190 He won't miss something he's never had.
###1193 And if he gets some relief from knowing that his mother
###1195 didn't entirely hate him, may even have had some affection for him,
###1200 I'd say it's money well spent.
###1201 You're meant to be setting an example, we're impressionable.
###1204 You are a bollocks. You haven't been impressionable since you bought
###1209 your first pack of 20 king size, aged seven.
###1213 And her ... you can act like Lady Muck all you please.
###1218 You have pram-face written all over you.
###1222 You really are horrible.
###1228 My advice to you is watch and learn.
###1232 You won't always be jail-bait and then what'll you do?
###1238 # The best things in life are free

###1266 We are, yeah, just a little livener, a swift voddie to line us guts.

###1272 Cross me heart.
###1279 Cheer up. We'll have a great night.
###1281 It's been ages since we've all been out together.
###1283 Sure you're all right with this, mate?
###1284 Yeah. Course.
###1286 Got to admire the girl, she's doing great.
###1288 Yeah.
###1290 Oh, Manchester! Is wonderful! Oh, Manchester is wonderful!
###1295 THEY SHOUT AND CHANT
###1301 I'm forward planning.
###1302 I'm being proactive to nip future problems in the bud.
###1306 What future problems?
###1307 There's a quarter of a century between us.
###1309 I don't want to be looking over my shoulder all the time,
###1312 waiting for that to bite me on the arse.
###1314 And the solution is for him to shag other women?
###1317 Amongst other things. I can't be "all women" to Billy,
###1321 and it'd be humiliating to try.
###1323 There's stuff in his life where I don't fit in, and vice versa.
###1329 Now that is a very healthy attitude.
###1332 I mean, people just...
###1333 They get hung up about sex. It gets in the way of everything.
###1341 What the fuck's that for?
###1342 Cos I can't fucking slap her.
###1345 And that's where you come in, son.
###1347 He's reluctant, and you're my son and I trust you.
###1351 And that's why I want you to take your stepfather out
###1354 and get him laid.
###1355 And there is a sentence I never thought I'd hear
###1358 when I woke up this morning.
###1362 Sorry ... I'll slow up.
###1365 You do realise, don't you?
###1367 There's not a court in this land that'd convict,
###1370 if I chopped the fucking lot of you up right now.
###1372 Please, son.
###1375 I'll do it.
###1376 I'll do it on one condition.
###1378 You do it too.

###1395 Too obvious.
###1398 All right ... her?
###1399 She's taller than I am.

###1403 She's got an Adam's Apple!
###1405 I don't care if it's a one-legged, Geordie, fucking dwarf
###1408 with a glass eye and a ginger beard.
###1410 I don't care if it's a bloke.

###1472 What's got into you?
###1473 Just fuck off!
###1475 Don't start all that!
###1477 I can't help it.
###1478 Feeling all sorry for yourself. Making it about you.
###1481 I'm dealing with it.
###1483 It's time you did.
###1503 (MIMI) I hate these places. Always feel like I stand out.
###1507 Why blend in? Where's the fun in that?
###1510 It's all right for you...
###1512 you always manage to pull off the kind of casual-trampy look.
###1516 I'm a bit more reserved.
###1518 That's the word that springs to mind...
###1520 reserved(!)
###1523 Oi!
###1524 You're not a Catholic schoolgirl nowadays.
###1527 You need to flaunt the goodies.
###1529 Well, hello!
###1533 I haven't done this in fucking years.
###1537 Now, listen ... don't get carried away
###1539 if you get a lot of attention early on, all right?
###1542 Course. Why?
###1544 To avoid disappointment.
###1547 Some of them might be chatting you up... strategically.
###1552 Are you saying I'm the ugly mate?
###1554 No! Just... be realistic.
###1558 I will.
###1560 Realistically, a woman your age
###1562 shouldn't try to get away with wearing a dress like that.
###1565 You look like a turkey stuffed in a stocking.
###1581 Thank you for a lovely meal.
###1585 The pleasure was all mine.
###1586 I'll see you tomorrow for the reading of the will?
###1589 You must think I'm pathetic.
###1591 A man my age, all curious about his mother.
###1595 We all want to know from whence we came.
###1596 Talking to you helps me understand her.
###1599 Why she did the things she did.
###1603 Could I stay?
###1605 Sorry?
###1607 Please?
###1609 Or you could stay at mine.
###1611 I just want to be with you, that's all. It's like part of her.
###1614 No, not tonight.
###1617 I never had a mother. You don't know what
###1619 that's like ... to find her, then lose her again.
###1622 Yes, I'm sure Walt Disney will be making a film about it very soon,
###1626 but I have heard enough. Thank you.
###1630 I'd like you to leave.
###1644 I have them every other weekend. I'm on really good terms with my ex.
###1648 The divorce must have been awful for you.
###1652 Yeah, not the best.
###1654 You OK there, Mimi?
###1658 Yeah, great.
###1660 There's got to be a dance floor in here somewhere.
###1661 Yeah, up the stairs.
###1663 I fancy throwing some shapes.
###1665 I'm sure there'll be a line-up of guys
###1667 can't wait to get on the floor with you.
###1670 I'll stay here with Mimi. ..If that's OK with you?
###1673 Sound.
###1675 Right, I'll get some more drinks in.
###1682 Off you trot to the dance floor, Turkey.
###1685 Choosing you over me
###1687 qualifies as a fetish.
###1690 You know that, don't you?
###1692 Gobble, gobble, gobble.
###1696 I might just do that.

###1702 # FAITHLESS: Insomnia
###1709 I know what you're going through.

###1713 It wasn't easy. Avril didn't leave the house for weeks.
###1718 Kelly seems to be coping OK, though.
###1720 Well, she's not OK! She's fucking not!
###1724 Didn't mean anything.
###1729 Get the fuck off her!
###1765 Was that so bad?
###1767 No.
###1768 Do you need me to accompany you to the bedroom?
###1769 No.
###1771 You can if you want.
###1774 I don't think I could afford the therapy, love.
###1777 Just make sure you ride him good, will you?
###1790 God almighty!
###1792 What's going on?
###1793 Nothing.
###1795 What are you doing here?!
###1798 I wanted to see you sleeping.
###1800 Why?
###1803 I've done all right.
###1805 I'm leading a decent life...
###1807 good job, no wife yet, but there's time.
###1811 I'm proud of where I've got to.
###1813 As you should be.
###1814 I should be fucked up with everything that was done to me.
###1817 I need to know why she left.
###1820 I need you to leave this house.
###1822 I won't hurt you.
###1824 Oh, I know that...
###1826 but you have to go.
###1834 Yeah.
###1844 Cheers.
###1853 Fuck me, you're a smooth one.
###1855 Not really.
###1859 Listen, I'm no expert.
###1862 You only have to ask my ex-wives,
###1864 but something's not right here. What's going on?
###1871 I'm married. Happily.
###1873 You can't be that happy.
###1877 We're trying an open relationship.
###1881 So, this...
###1882 Is the only thing I can think of
###1883 to keep me and my fella together in the long term.
###1886 There's an age issue.
###1887 I don't want it looming over us in years to come.
###1890 And you really don't want to sleep with other men?
###1895 We've both got to do it or it won't work, you see?
###1898 Bizarrely, I think I do.
###1901 Pity ... I can peel a satsuma with this tongue.
###1908 (SCREAMS THROUGHOUT)
###1924 Where is he? Where the fuck is he?!
###1929 Uch!
###1953 ELASTIC SNAPS
###1954 (Oh!)
###1968 (Come on!)
###1973 (Fuck!)
###1974 Avril Powell?
###1978 (LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)
###1997 What a night.
###1998 I don't even remember getting home, though.
###2001 You woke the whole house, needing money for the taxi!
###2004 You owe me ten... £20!
###2007 Jesus, what happened to you?!
###2011 Oh, yeah, I remember now.
###2013 RADIO PLAYS IN BACKGROUND
###2018 Where are you going?
###2019 What do you care?
###2023 I don't, really.
###2024 I used to think you were a victim of circumstance
###2027 and now I can see you're just stupid.
###2031 Stupid?
###2034 Like the bloke whose grief you're ripping off?
###2037 Got your mitts in the will yet?
###2048 Doesn't look that bad.
###2050 I'm a fucking peanut smuggler!
###2052 You could hang your trilby off these.
###2055 Oh, behave! I have breasts and an arse and a muff.
###2059 This shouldn't be news to you.
###2061 In my first job, it was considered a privilege
###2063 to be bent over the boss's desk for a spanking.
###2066 Oh, the things that feminism's robbed us of, eh?
###2069 Though, if it had been a bloke doing the interview,
###2072 you'd be on Easy Street by now.
###2074 Maybe you blew her away in the chat.
###2076 Let me see... once we established I had no relevant qualifications
###2082 or experience to speak of ... a subject we kept returning to...
###2085 Why'd they have you in, if you had nothing to offer?
###2088 That's exactly what she said...
###2091 "Precisely, what do you have to offer?"
###2093 Well... the thing is, I...
###2097 What would you say is your breast quality?
###2098 Pardon?
###2100 Your breast quality.
###2103 My best quality? Just nipple.
###2107 Oh, dear!
###2108 How embarrassing.
###2110 You think?
###2112 Look, I'm good and I'm fucking clever!
###2117 But if paper-smart's what counts,
###2119 there's a bucketful out in the corridor fit the bill better.
###2129 Look, there's plenty more jobs in the sea.
###2132 I look forward to the ritual humiliation.
###2141 PHONE RINGS
###2145 Hello?
###2150 Mum.
###2151 Jesus! Me knickers have hardly hit the floor!
###2153 It's the hospital on the phone, they're offering you the job.
###2157 Fuck off, that's not funny!
###2158 It's true.
###2169 Hello?
###2170 RADIO PLAYS IN BACKGROUND
###2172 She said she admired my honesty... plain speaking.
###2178 You are... looking at...
###2181 a trainee pharmacist assistant.
###2184 Whoo-hoo! Cheers, Avril.
###2186 Cheers, Avril. Well done, hon.
###2187 You have got a job!
###2190 Oh-ho!
###2193 Morning.
###2195 Don't, mate, honestly, don't fucking talk to me.
###2197 Me head is full up, there's no more room.
###2200 Thank you.
###2202 My pleasure.
###2206 You shag her?
###2208 Yeah, all night.
###2211 Inside out, and upside down.
###2213 Come on! This is just getting tasteless now.
###2217 You really did it?
###2223 I did it for us.
###2225 You're a very lucky man. Fuck off!
###2227 You?
###2228 I shagged her.
###2230 I haven't washed, to prove it.
###2232 Oh, don't!
###2233 I am fucking serious, right?!
###2236 I can't take this any more.
###2240 Not another fucking word!
###2243 Did he try and pork you?
###2244 You read about such things ... folk have a fetish for the horrific.
###2249 There was no porking ... attempted or otherwise.
###2253 Blackmail him... or call the cops.
###2255 He's a paedophile.
###2258 No... the opposite of a paedophile.
###2260 I can be unkind to you sometimes.
###2263 But you are conclusive proof
###2265 that modern culture is rotting the brains of our youth.
###2269 We could ask Jamie to sort him out.
###2270 No!
###2271 He's got something coming, love.
###2273 You can't stroke a lady's hairnet and get away with it.
###2287 May I?
###2288 Please.
###2295 I'm sorry.
###2296 No need.
###2298 You have to understand that...
###2300 I do. A mother's love is important.
###2304 All those gobshites there think...
###2306 I'm about to rip money out of your pocket
###2309 but I'm not.
###2310 I couldn't give a monkey's fart about the money.
###2313 I'll tell you the truth about your mother,
###2316 if you promise to leave here afterwards
###2318 and never contact me again.
###2322 OK.
###2324 I have one further condition.
###2328 You said your mammy had a house full of possessions.
###2333 There is one item of sentimental value
###2335 I would very much like to have.
###2337 It's an album of photographs.
###2339 Anything, I...
###2342 I just need to know.
###2346 Her name was Irene Felice O'Donnell.
###2350 She was born on the 22nd August 1939,
###2354 not '42, as her birth certificate would attest.
###2359 She never loved your father.
###2363 Whatever you may think of him,
###2365 he wasn't a nice man ... a bully, aggressive.
###2371 She married him on the rebound from the love of her life.
###2379 That would be me.
###2386 I consider my time with your mummy
###2389 the best days I ever had.
###2408 Rule one ... never stay the night.
###2411 Quick shag, then home.
###2412 Mm-hm.
###2413 Two ... always, always wear a johnny.
###2416 Nobody calls them johnnies any more.
###2418 WOLF WHISTLING
###2421 Three ... no shitting on your own doorstep.
###2424 I've suffered enough local humiliation.
###2427 No guys back to our marital bed...
###2428 don't need those pictures in my head.
###2430 Fair enough.
###2431 No-one over the age of 25... I'm your personal MILF.
###2435 (LAUGHS) No...one under the age of 35 ... I'm your spunky, young lad.
###2439 This might actually work, you know. To be honest...
###2442 I enjoyed it.
###2444 BABY CRIES
###2445 Oh! We've got a live one.
###2448 (Come on, then.)
###2450 Oh, ah!
###2458 So, how was he, you old slapper?!
###2462 What the fuck have I done, G?
###2466 But I thought it was your idea.
###2468 And it's the right idea.
###2470 Doesn't make it any easier, though.
###2474 I've not slept for 48 hours.
###2481 # Through my sleepless days I've found
###2486 # That in my dreamless sleep I'm bound
###2491 # To one night hear the sound
###2495 # Of you calling
###2498 # Do not stumble through tonight
###2501 # Have no fear of falling
###2508 # And if nobody got lost
###2512 # And if no-one paid the cost
###2515 # The price of this, you may surmise
###2519 # Is forever after
###2522 # You won't stumble through tonight
###2527 # Drowning in... #
###2528 It's all right, I've got it.
###2530 # You won't stumble through tonight
###2533 # Drowning in their laughter. #
###2540 This isn't what anyone would have wanted...
###2545 least of all me and Kelly.
###2555 It's easy to look back and think how things could have been different.
###2563 But what's harder is to look forward when something like this happens...
###2568 cos it's hard to imagine a future.
###2573 But we were blessed...
###2577 me and Kelly were blessed.
###2580 Our baby's name was Cherry Belle.
###2589 She'll always be with us.
###2604 Thank you.
###2605 That's it now.
###2607 It's time to... stop grieving and start living.
###2612 Where are you going?
###2615 It's time I got back on the horse, so to speak.
###2617 I'm taking a shift at work.
###2619 You can't.
###2620 I mean...
###2622 ain't it disrespectful... to the baby?
###2643 Oh, I'm shot to bits.
###2646 So am I ... don't know if I'll last.
###2648 Oh, come on, babe.
###2650 I've been looking forward to this all day.
###2653 It's your chapter.
###2655 Where did we stop?
###2657 Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban,
###2659 and Ron and Hermione think he's coming after Harry.
###2663 'They say that you get your reward in heaven.
###2666 'But they also say that time waits for no man...
###2668 'or woman.'
###2677 'If you don't want to wait until you get to heaven,
###2679 'then you have to grab what you can, when you can.'
###2694 'We can't wait for others to fail
###2696 'or for them to succeed and give us what we need,
###2698 'because our time here can be so short
###2702 'and we can't wait for the rest of the world to catch up.
###2706 'So if you're lucky and if you work at it
###2709 'and throw yourself into it
###2711 'then you might, just might
###2713 'get your reward, right here on Earth.'
###2719 I think I'm in love.
###2720 Not the spaz?! Fuck off!
###2722 Say you did shag a bird in a wheeler, wouldn't it hurt?
###2724 Maybe, if you let the brakes off!
###2726 Don't want to be another lad. I want to be your lad.
###2729 Got anywhere to go? Want a Viagra?
###2731 I never go anywhere without my little bits.
###2733 Outside.
###2735 Can't we just do it in the... Oof!
###2738 I'm your Auntie Angel. Say hello to your auntie!
###2740 Eww.
###2742 I want to strap you onto me and fuck you till your eyes water.

###2796 We have got to go upstairs right now.
###2799 The night's young, Gloria.
###2801 I'm so wet, I might slip off me chair. Now!
