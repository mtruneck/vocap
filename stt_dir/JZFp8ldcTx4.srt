FAUSTINO BARRIENTOS:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]


4
0:0:50,615 --> 0:1:57,292



5
0:1:57,292 --> 0:1:58,96
ADRI MURGUIA: Faustino
Barrientos embodies the


6
0:1:58,96 --> 0:2:1,51
timeless lifestyle of the
Chilean gaucho, the more


7
0:2:1,51 --> 0:2:4,96
isolated equivalent of the
North American cowboy.


8
0:2:4,96 --> 0:2:7,77
Bringing settlers into Patagonia
was a challenge.


9
0:2:7,77 --> 0:2:11,3
And in 1937, Chile started
handing out land claims to


10
0:2:11,3 --> 0:2:14,34
each colonizer who could clear
120 acres of forest in an


11
0:2:14,34 --> 0:2:17,35
effort to make the
land fertile.


12
0:2:17,35 --> 0:2:20,13
Although construction of routes
to Patagonia land made


13
0:2:20,13 --> 0:2:23,16
the gauchos more accessible,
we heard that Faustino had


14
0:2:23,16 --> 0:2:25,58
moved far beyond the last
stretch of the Pan-American


15
0:2:25,58 --> 0:2:28,77
Highway to Peninsula La Florida,
where he continued


16
0:2:28,77 --> 0:2:34,7
living in complete isolation,
like the original settlers.


17
0:2:34,7 --> 0:2:36,44
Faustino is rumored to be living
alone on his land for


18
0:2:36,44 --> 0:2:39,71
the past 46 years, removed
from civilization and


19
0:2:39,71 --> 0:2:42,375
technology as if time had
never struck Patagonia.


20
0:2:42,375 --> 0:2:54,45



21
0:2:54,45 --> 0:2:56,98
We set out on a journey to find
Faustino Barrientos--


22
0:2:56,98 --> 0:3:0,6
from New York on a cold
winter night.


23
0:3:0,6 --> 0:3:3,7
We had about a dozen bags with
us and had no idea of what we


24
0:3:3,7 --> 0:3:4,75
were getting ourselves into.


25
0:3:4,75 --> 0:3:7,34
What we did know is it will take
us four days of travel


26
0:3:7,34 --> 0:3:8,59
time to reach him.


27
0:3:8,59 --> 0:3:10,88



28
0:3:10,88 --> 0:3:13,26
We caught an 11 hour
flight to Santiago.


29
0:3:13,26 --> 0:3:14,74
We had a layover, and
then got on a


30
0:3:14,74 --> 0:3:16,3
shorter flight to Balmaceda.


31
0:3:16,3 --> 0:3:18,896



32
0:3:18,896 --> 0:3:21,77
There we met our crew, gathered
our gear, loaded the


33
0:3:21,77 --> 0:3:24,556
truck, and drove to Cochrane,
which took five hours.


34
0:3:24,556 --> 0:3:28,29



35
0:3:28,29 --> 0:3:30,75
We spent the night there and
headed out to Port Yungay in


36
0:3:30,75 --> 0:3:33,98
the morning to catch our
ferry to Rio Bravo.


37
0:3:33,98 --> 0:3:36,1
It had taken us two days
to get this far.


38
0:3:36,1 --> 0:3:37,65
And we weren't even
halfway there.


39
0:3:37,65 --> 0:3:40,39
It was impossible to imagine how
you would ever get here by


40
0:3:40,39 --> 0:3:43,2
horse rides from Santiago, like
Faustino had probably


41
0:3:43,2 --> 0:3:44,45
done in the past.


42
0:3:44,45 --> 0:3:48,568



43
0:3:48,568 --> 0:3:51,77
Patagonia's a region at the
southern end of South America.


44
0:3:51,77 --> 0:3:54,9
The area covers about one-third
of both Chile and


45
0:3:54,9 --> 0:3:56,9
Argentina and is home
to a rich and


46
0:3:56,9 --> 0:3:59,59
mostly untouched ecosystem.


47
0:3:59,59 --> 0:4:2,9
It's an important fresh water
source, which also makes it


48
0:4:2,9 --> 0:4:3,98
one of the least polluted
places on earth.


49
0:4:3,98 --> 0:4:15,181



50
0:4:15,181 --> 0:4:18,399
On our third day of travel, we
finally arrived at the end of


51
0:4:18,399 --> 0:4:20,88
the Pan-American Highway, which
was built to connect


52
0:4:20,88 --> 0:4:24,28
remote communities
in the region.


53
0:4:24,28 --> 0:4:27,7
Its final stretch reaches
Villa O'Higgins, a town


54
0:4:27,7 --> 0:4:30,38
formerly only accessible by
plane or horse ride, which is


55
0:4:30,38 --> 0:4:32,83
why it's called the "Last
Frontier of Chilean


56
0:4:32,83 --> 0:4:38,46
Patagonia." With a population
of roughly 400 people, it's


57
0:4:38,46 --> 0:4:41,26
considered a stomping ground for
explorers and scientists


58
0:4:41,26 --> 0:4:43,86
heading towards the South
Patagonian Ice Field, which


59
0:4:43,86 --> 0:4:45,77
doubles as deepest lake
in the Americas.


60
0:4:45,77 --> 0:4:48,73



61
0:4:48,73 --> 0:4:51,58
While we were in O'Higgins, we
visited Faustino's brother to


62
0:4:51,58 --> 0:4:53,75
get a better idea of what
to expect from him.

70
0:5:56,31 --> 0:5:59,48



71
0:5:59,48 --> 0:6:1,73
It seemed that Faustino
had a bad reputation


72
0:6:1,73 --> 0:6:2,99
throughout the town.


73
0:6:2,99 --> 0:6:4,87
There was even a rumor
that he had attempted


74
0:6:4,87 --> 0:6:7,486
to shoot his nephew.

78
0:6:13,15 --> 0:6:56,84



79
0:6:56,84 --> 0:6:58,47
ADRI MURGUIA: After learning
that Faustino not only


80
0:6:58,47 --> 0:7:0,88
disliked other people's company,
but also had tried to


81
0:7:0,88 --> 0:7:3,22
kill one of his family members,
we're more than


82
0:7:3,22 --> 0:7:5,91
concerned about staying with
him on a deserted piece of


83
0:7:5,91 --> 0:7:8,96
land without escape routes or
forms of communication with


84
0:7:8,96 --> 0:7:10,22
the outside world.


85
0:7:10,22 --> 0:7:11,85
But we continued on our
way to find him.


86
0:7:11,85 --> 0:7:32,81



87
0:7:32,81 --> 0:7:36,37
Since 2005, this boat started
taking tourists on glacial


88
0:7:36,37 --> 0:7:39,78
expeditions and contributed to
bringing civilization closer


89
0:7:39,78 --> 0:7:42,61
to those who lived out
here in isolation.


90
0:7:42,61 --> 0:7:44,98
It was appropriately named
Robinson Crusoe.


91
0:7:44,98 --> 0:8:19,13



92
0:8:19,13 --> 0:8:21,765
I made it.


93
0:8:21,765 --> 0:8:24,33
We're in Faustino's land.


94
0:8:24,33 --> 0:8:26,55
We were told to walk straight
from the shore towards the


95
0:8:26,55 --> 0:8:29,29
mountains and we'd
find his home.


96
0:8:29,29 --> 0:8:31,29
I don't know if we're
walking in the right


97
0:8:31,29 --> 0:8:32,526
direction, to be honest.


98
0:8:32,526 --> 0:8:36,52



99
0:8:36,52 --> 0:8:39,15
As the boat took off in the
distance, we realized how


100
0:8:39,15 --> 0:8:40,55
isolated we really were.


101
0:8:40,55 --> 0:8:45,42



102
0:8:45,42 --> 0:8:47,92
We walked for about a mile
until we finally spotted


103
0:8:47,92 --> 0:8:49,17
Faustino's retreat.
