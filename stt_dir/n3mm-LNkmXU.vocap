###29 I just started my professorial duty in Frankfurt on Monday
###37 night, actually.
###38 I'm the film class professor.
###41 It's very serious.
###43 And one of the things I said to one of the students was
###47 that I was a very diligent student, and I did my life
###52 drawing class.
###53 And I did my stained glass window class.
###56 I did my mural painting class.
###58 The only class that I really got deliberately ill enough
###64 not to be able to attend was the video class.
###68 I always hated it.
###71 I knew what I liked, and what I liked was film.
###75 And there was something very primal for me, in that I don't
###81 really like information to be shot straight into my eye.
###88 I always preferred the idea that you are getting it in
###92 some kind of a third-hand way.
###95 You have the celluloid.
###97 A light passes through.
###100 It hits the screen.
###101 And then your eye gets it.
###103 And there's something softer, even if you're watching a very
###106 hard series of images, with difficult ideas.
###111 I think there's a softer landing.
###114 It's very telling that technocrats and technicians
###120 have been pushing video to be as close to film as possible.
###126 Therefore, film is still on that pedestal.
###132 
###149 When I started looking at films in a certain way, and
###155 doing almost nothing to them except re-presenting the way
###160 that they would be seen, or could be seen, that definitely
###163 is coming from the kind of intellectual rigor that I had
###168 through my studies in London.
###169 But I think the choices of the films that I worked on were
###173 probably coming from this much more
###176 autobiographical exercise.
###178 
###184 Let's take, for example, Hitchcock's "Psycho" and "Taxi
###192 Driver," for instance.
###194 I didn't see "Psycho," I think, until I was about 21.
###198 And I didn't see "Taxi Driver" until I was about 26 or 27.
###207 I mean, there was a lot to do with the old experience of
###212 cinema, as well.
###214 And the fact that there was something happening, I think,
###217 in the 1980s, in Britain at least, that cinema was going
###222 down, and TV and VCR was coming up.
###227 And my experience of film was definitely much more in the
###233 domestic situation, rather than the communal cinematic,
###237 or cathedral, of cinema, which I like
###240 to think about sometimes.
###243 And then when I got into it, and hit the French New Wave--
###248 and one of the most important books, which I think is one of
###251 the best books on cinema ever, is the interviews between
###256 Hitchcock and Truffaut.
###257 And that was kind of a turning point, I think, for me, when I
###261 realized that there were different types of cinema.
###265 They could be deconstructed, and you could openly seduce
###271 people at the same time as being slightly intellectual.
###277 One of my students, actually, in Frankfurt, said to me, when
###283 was the last time you went to the cinema?
###284 
###287 I had to kind of lie and say, I never go to the cinema for
###293 moral reasons.
###294 But the last time I was in the cinema was to see my work.
###297 Last time I was in the cinema before that
###299 was to see my work.
###301 The last time I was in the cinema before that
###303 was to see my work.
###304 And that just sounds like such a load of wank.
###307 To a student, sometimes it's better not to tell the truth.
###313 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###325 When I started to work with the material, and I mean when
###331 the material will be a videotape, and like an
###336 innocent person, I did take a videotape and held it up-- and
###339 there's nothing to see.
###341 And that's magical, as well.
###342 It appears to be nothing, but it contains all this
###345 information of a different--
###346 
###349 I suppose it's the early idea of the avatar, in a way, that
###352 the cinema screen has all these characters behind.
###357 And I think with "24 Hour Psycho," when I installed that
###359 in Glasgow for the first time in 1993, I wanted to put the
###366 screen in the middle of the space, so when you went behind
###369 it, you just saw the same thing from the other side, but
###374 from the other side.
###375 So that's when I started to get interested
###377 in the mirror image.
###379 
###383 I went from there into hospital archives, and started
###390 to dig around and for images which looked magical, because
###396 they were shot by cinematographers, even though
###401 they were done, apparently, for medical purposes.
###404 It became obvious that I was going to have to get behind
###407 the camera one day, rather than stand in
###409 front of the mirror.
###410 I had to take another step back and be behind the camera,
###415 and behind the lens, also in front of a mirror.
###420 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###434 I knew I had to start making films.
###437 And actually, the first film that I made was called
###441 "Feature Film." Maybe I wasn't confident enough to think that
###445 I would make anything other than that, so I had this kind
###449 of very teenage, vain idea that in my life I always
###455 wanted to write a short novel, make a record, and make a
###459 feature film.
###460 So at least I got the feature film done.
###463 
###466 And having done that, which was a study of a conductor
###475 with an orchestra--
###477 the orchestra are never seen, so how would you know that he
###480 would be a conductor?
###482 And the orchestra are playing the score to Hitchcock's
###488 "Vertigo."
###489 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###503 And when we showed that, some people who saw it had asked me
###510 questions like, how many little images did you slip in
###515 from "Vertigo?" Because they really think that they saw
###520 James Stewart or Kim Novak in my film.
###524 And it never happened.
###526 But cinematic experience and the music obviously was
###534 powerful enough that images were coming from inside of
###538 their head, and they were projecting their
###540 images onto my film.
###543 And I thought that that's an incredibly sophisticated and
###549 perverse thing to happen.
###552 
###563 After making "Feature Film," and I was quite confident by
###566 that time then about working in the industry.
###573 So the premise for "Zidane" was what if we make a feature
###579 film which is a portrait, and why not make it around a
###586 football player?
###589 And of course when we went to see Zidane it became three
###592 questions--
###593 what if, why not, and Zidane said, why me?
###600 And we said to him, no one really knows what
###604 aftershave you wear.
###606 We don't know if you go out to nightclubs.
###609 You exist from the first kick of the ball
###613 until the final whistle.
###615 And that's what's incredibly special about you as a player.
###622 He represents something which is exclusively
###624 him, completely chimeric.
###629 So he becomes everyone else.
###634 The day before the match, that's when our
###641 crew started to arrive.
###642 And you can imagine 17 or 18 cameras, each camera having an
###647 operator, a focus puller, a loader, and a runner.
###653 I think the crew was about 150 or something like that.
###656 
###659 The pressure was on.
###661 And still the producers were saying to us, you have to make
###666 a storyboard.
###668 And we said, we can't.
###669 It's a live event.
###672 And they said, but you have to be able to say something to
###675 the operators about what it is that you want.
###679 So Philippe and I had a little chat.
###685 The collection of portraits in the Prado is probably one of
###688 the best in the world.
###690 So we took our camera guys there on the
###694 morning of the game.
###696 And they opened up the doors to the Prado, and we walked in
###699 through the Goya entrance.
###702 And you have this vast corridor of portrait after
###708 portrait after portrait.
###710 And we said to the film guys, to the operators, this is our
###716 storyboard.
###718 Look down the corridor, and imagine that every painting is
###721 a film still.
###723 And as we're walking past, please look carefully at every
###728 still that you're seeing.
###730 Now, we're shooting at 24 frames a second, but we want
###735 all of the information that you're seeing from this Goya,
###739 which probably took about a year to paint--
###742 we want a year's worth in everything.
###745 So we obviously set the bar pretty high.
###750 And it was astonishing.
###753 These guys who shoot, who look at people, and look at events
###757 as their daily bread, had never seen
###760 anything quite like that.
###763 One of the most beautiful memories that I have is
###766 standing in front of these two paintings of the Duchess of
###773 Alba, I think it is, both by Goya, same
###779 woman lying on a chaise.
###783 One she has her clothes on.
###785 One she is not wearing clothes.
###789 But the angle of observation is slightly different.
###794 And Philippe and I were saying, we don't really know
###798 how to explain what's going on here, but look at the dynamic
###801 between the two pictures.
###805 It's a phenomenon.
###808 So we got the most expensive storyboard in the history of
###813 film done, because we used the Prado.
###815 
###824 I don't think that anybody that I really respect thinks
###826 of themselves in any world.
###830 The best chefs I know are always involved
###834 in something else.
###837 The best filmmakers are always involved in something else.
###839 The best singers are always doing something else.
###842 I think you can be a hermetic, but within your little hermit
###850 cave or whatever, I think it's important that you have
###853 something else happening somewhere else in the world.
###856 
###861 One of the best comments that a teacher ever made to her
###867 class in Glasgow was, you're here for four years--
###870 
###873 don't feel that you have to leave and be an artist.
###877 Just enjoy this four years that you have here, because
###880 you'll never have this amount of freedom again.
###882 
###887 And as a little lotus eater that I am, I wanted to
###890 perpetuate that four years for as long as possible.
###895 So that's why I don't really have a huge engagement with
###901 what's perceived to be the art market, or the art world, or
###904 the film world, or anything else.
###910 People will always put you in a pigeonhole.
###913 Why would you fly in on your own?
###915
