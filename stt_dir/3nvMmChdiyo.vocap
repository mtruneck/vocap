###23 BILL: You are a beautiful reckless woman.
###27 JANE: Damn right I am.
###29 BILL: You're going to be the death of me.
###32 JANE: Probably.
###34 BILL: I don't care.
###35 JANE: All right.
###36 It's your funeral.
###38 [LOUD BRASSY MUSIC]
###41 NARRATOR: Bill was the town pariah, the most hated man in
###45 a 20-mile radius.
###47 The reasons for this were unclear.
###49 Maybe it was because he spent his youth in and out of jail.
###52 Maybe it was because he fought and drank and used the Lord's
###55 name in vain without remorse.
###58 Maybe it was because he was the greatest firefighter the
###60 town had ever seen--
###62 so brave, he made the others look like cowards.
###65 
###71 So they conspired to have him dishonorably discharged.
###75 But Jane was madly in love with Bill.
###77 She taught him things she'd learned at university, like
###81 how wealth redistribution was the only solution to the
###83 world's problems.
###84 He taught her how to shoot a gun.
###86 
###90 The town was notorious for the amount of miraculous
###92 interventions that had occurred there.
###94 People traveled from all over the country
###96 in order to be healed.
###99 Jane's father was the town pastor.
###102 PASTOR: We must agree that unclean spirits shall be
###105 purged from our lives!
###107 We shall all--
###107 NARRATOR: Needless to say, he was not fond of Bill.
###109 PASTOR: --at the last trump, when the Rapture comes!
###112 When we mount that white horse.
###114 NARRATOR: Bill's only sympathizers were
###117 the men in his group.
###119 BILL: I know I could be a good person.
###122 I just have these terrible things inside of me.
###126 NARRATOR: Bill's best friend was Paul Mermelstein, a
###128 disgraced engineer.
###130 
###133 Bill assisted Paul with his scientific endeavors.
###137 PAUL: It's a debacle!
###140 BILL: It'll work.
###142 PAUL: You should have seen me 30 years ago!
###145 I was gorgeous!
###146 The police would have to escort me down the street
###149 because the girls literally would rip the
###151 clothes off my back!
###153 [STATICKY RADIO ANNOUNCEMENT]
###156 BILL: It's a two-alarm.
###158 PAUL: I'll get the car.
###160 JANE: Oh, come on!
###162 Stop terrorizing the fire department!
###164 BILL: I'm not terrorizing them.
###165 They can't do their job.
###167 
###170 NARRATOR: When the firefighters arrived, Bill and
###173 Paul had already put out the blaze.
###174 
###181 Bill was a danger to the community.
###184 It was decided that something had to be done.
###187 PASTOR: Bill, have you sinned?
###188 
###191 BILL: Yes.
###192 PASTOR: Have you felt lost?
###195 BILL: Yes.
###196 PASTOR: Are you ready to allow the Lord to exile your
###198 destructive ways?
###200 
###210 BILL: OK.
###211 
###213 PASTOR: We allow this troubled spirit to receive a blessing
###216 from the Holy Ghost!
###216 Will you give him the glory and reign of your atonement,
###219 Jesus Christ!
###222 JANE: I didn't know he was going to do that.
###225 BILL: It's OK.
###227 JANE: I'm sorry.
###230 BILL: It's OK.
###231 He can say whatever he wants.
###234 Doesn't mean anything anyway.
###236 NARRATOR: But the pastor had asked for a miracle.
###240 And a miracle did occur.
###242 For God had put a curse on Bill's axe.
###244 
###248 There was nothing the doctors could do to
###250 reattach Bill's arm.
###252 So Paul built him a mechanical limb, one made of tin.
###257 PAUL: It's the best I could do.
###259 
###262 NARRATOR: But Jane still loved Bill and stood by him.
###265 And soon things returned to normal.
###267 
###269 But the curse was still there.
###271 
###280 Bill quit his job as a lumberjack.
###282 Unfortunately, the only job he could find was at the
###285 slaughterhouse.
###286 
###288 -Help!
###290 There's a problem with the machine!
###291 
###337 NARRATOR: Bill was in a coma for two months.
###340 During this time Paul worked tirelessly to save his
###342 friend's life.
###344 Though by now he was more metal than flesh.
###347 PAUL: I managed to save your eyes, your heart, some of your
###351 other organs.
###352 Honestly, I have no idea why you're still alive.
###356 TINMAN: I gotta see Jane.
###358 PAUL: I don't think that's a good idea.
###360 
###385 JANE: Stay way from me!
###386 Get out of here!
###387 
###394 NARRATOR: Paul told the Tinman what had happened.
###396 PAUL: Here.
###396 Have a drink.
###398 NARRATOR: How Bill's remains had
###399 disappeared from the morgue.
###402 How they had returned the next day, walking upright, a
###406 creature without veins or lungs or heart.
###410 
###412 How the pastor had called it a miracle.
###416 How happy Jane was to have her man back in some form.
###420 The next day the Tinman went to see his
###422 love, but to no avail.
###424 FIREFIGHTER: She doesn't want to see you.
###427 TINMAN: Did she say that?
###428 FIREFIGHTER: Get lost, or else.
###432 TINMAN: I'm not going anywhere, you damn cowards.
###434 
###448 FIREFIGHTER: We found these in the woods.
###450 TINMAN: She doesn't want anything to do with me.
###453 I'm hideous.
###454 PAUL: Don't say that!
###456 
###489 TINMAN: I feel like I'm gonna explode.
###492 How do you make someone love you again?
###494 What's the noblest thing you can possibly do?
###497 PAUL: You can steal from the rich and give to the poor.
###500 TINMAN: All right, I'll do it.
###503 I guess I have nothing else to lose anyway.
###507 PAUL: I was joking.
###509 
###512 NARRATOR: So the Tinman reinvented himself as a
###513 revolutionary in order to win Jane's affection.
###518 He successfully redistributed 87% of the town's wealth.
###522 PAUL: Stick it to the pigs!
###524 TINMAN: Jane!
###526 I know you don't love him!
###529 JANE: You don't know that.
###530 TINMAN: He doesn't even have a heart!
###532 
###536 -Come on.
###537 The revolution needs you.
###539 NARRATOR: They stole every car in town, and cut down all the
###544 telephone wires.
###545 
###547 Not a sound came in or out.
###549 
###551 Soon the town descended into chaos.
###553 
###556 PAUL: What makes a king out of a slave?
###558 NARRATOR: The Tinman orchestrated a coup and
###561 installed Paul Murmelstein as Mayor.
###562 PAUL: --to reach beyond, not to sink into the abyss!
###566 PASTOR: Satan walks among us!
###568 We must rise now!
###569 
###587 JANE: Why are you doing this?
###588 TINMAN: I just want to make you happy.
###590 I miss you.
###592 
###594 JANE: I miss you, too.
###595 
###603 NARRATOR: Drunk with power, Paul Murmelstein declared
###605 himself the reincarnation of John the Baptist and tried to
###608 burn down the church.
###610 The faithful of the town fell into a persecuting frenzy.
###613 The pastor declared that the Meat Puppet was sent from Hell
###615 to destroy them all.
###619 -Wake up!
###619 They're going to hang your fiance!
###621 -Let him die!
###622 -Yeah!
###623 
###628 TINMAN: Do you really love this guy?
###629 
###632 JANE: I think so.
###633 
###636 TINMAN: All right.
###638 
###642 Let him go!
###644 
###658 -It's the Rapture!
###660 
###666 NARRATOR: The Tinman knew the only way to prove his love for
###668 Jane was to save the life of the one she truly loved.
###672 
###678 He ripped his heart out of his chest and placed it inside the
###683 Meat Puppet.
###684 
###700 TINMAN: Why are you still here?
###703 JANE: Because I'm a sinner.
###704 TINMAN: That's what I always liked about you.
###707 JANE: I still don't love you.
###709 TINMAN: That's OK.
###711 I don't have a heart anymore.
###715 JANE: Would you hold me?
###716
