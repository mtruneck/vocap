1
0:0:0,8 --> 0:0:3,379
we've talked about sexuality and how
it's on the spectrum what happens when


2
0:0:3,379 --> 0:0:7,999
your bisexual you end up with uh...
either why president and then


3
0:0:7,999 --> 0:0:11,82
years as your relationship you realize
you-know-what i'm not really into mine


4
0:0:11,82 --> 0:0:16,34
what if any more i think i wanna sleep
around with dilutes


5
0:0:16,34 --> 0:0:18,49
okay this is one way


6
0:0:18,49 --> 0:0:19,889
notebook back


7
0:0:19,889 --> 0:0:24,989
appetite another lie wife with that girl
scout on that woman's hut


8
0:0:24,989 --> 0:0:26,44
for this bob


9
0:0:26,44 --> 0:0:27,919
but that path


10
0:0:27,919 --> 0:0:32,859
anyway wanted like that have happened
jenny edmark bentley colin writes about


11
0:0:32,859 --> 0:0:34,64
a info on


12
0:0:34,64 --> 0:0:38,28
and it's a really fascinating case
because he realize you know years into


13
0:0:38,28 --> 0:0:40,1
his marriage


14
0:0:40,1 --> 0:0:44,62
he loved his wife there is no question
about it but he as he says and i'm


15
0:0:44,62 --> 0:0:46,759
quoting him verbatim start the habit


16
0:0:46,759 --> 0:0:48,38
hankering for men


17
0:0:48,38 --> 0:0:49,699
manhattan without them


18
0:0:49,699 --> 0:0:50,85
cell actually decide


19
0:0:50,85 --> 0:0:52,59
hookup


20
0:0:52,59 --> 0:0:56,419
tread activity and the three that was on
the witness stand up


21
0:0:56,419 --> 0:0:57,49
so happy


22
0:0:57,49 --> 0:1:1,22
he can play with his wife he told her
what the reality was that he act had


23
0:1:1,22 --> 0:1:2,56
been sleeping with


24
0:1:2,56 --> 0:1:4,15
uh... half a dozen men


25
0:1:4,15 --> 0:1:6,34
and uh... she


26
0:1:6,34 --> 0:1:8,52
hello would want more than a career


27
0:1:8,52 --> 0:1:12,15
it's like i was trading arms for the
rest of the sixties


28
0:1:12,15 --> 0:1:13,66
cake yeah alright


29
0:1:13,66 --> 0:1:17,36
so her response was the most fascinating
first of all questions that set because


30
0:1:17,36 --> 0:1:18,35
she felt like


31
0:1:18,35 --> 0:1:21,76
she didn't trust her enough to let her
know from the very beginning he had lied


32
0:1:21,76 --> 0:1:22,7
to her


33
0:1:22,7 --> 0:1:26,18
but she also seems very openminded when
it came to his sexuality and


34
0:1:26,18 --> 0:1:28,89
experimentation so try to the following
a salon


35
0:1:28,89 --> 0:1:32,6
he said shiatsu felt constrained by
marriage and she came to see


36
0:1:32,6 --> 0:1:36,159
that it was our spirit of adventure that
had run us together in the first place


37
0:1:36,159 --> 0:1:39,8
and want to continue on that adventure
with me


38
0:1:39,8 --> 0:1:42,79
but you're not the only one who wants to
experiment sexually and sleep with other


39
0:1:42,79 --> 0:1:46,37
people would run on the right back atcha


40
0:1:46,37 --> 0:1:47,44
sunday


41
0:1:47,44 --> 0:1:53,12
did not divorce they both understood
that their marriage was over


42
0:1:53,12 --> 0:1:56,47
that they retire marriage was over that
phase of their marriage is over and they


43
0:1:56,47 --> 0:2:0,87
wanted to move on to a different phase a
new and improved relationship where they


44
0:2:0,87 --> 0:2:3,38
say it would be to see if he cuts


45
0:2:3,38 --> 0:2:5,549
so they did something known as m_f_n_


46
0:2:5,549 --> 0:2:9,379
which is male female male uh... and
basically it's a threesome with regard


47
0:2:9,379 --> 0:2:11,15
to that seat you get the picture


48
0:2:11,15 --> 0:2:12,909
and work on the same yet


49
0:2:12,909 --> 0:2:13,94
celebrate


50
0:2:13,94 --> 0:2:17,81
but anyway but that the fascinating part
about this was the open-mindedness and


51
0:2:17,81 --> 0:2:19,399
the fact that


52
0:2:19,399 --> 0:2:24,649
they both realize that monogamy is a
societal expectations right and we've


53
0:2:24,649 --> 0:2:28,739
all kinda signed onto that societal
expectation and we all struggle with it


54
0:2:28,739 --> 0:2:31,169
and it's something that we could really
try to be


55
0:2:31,169 --> 0:2:32,729
faithful and committed to


56
0:2:32,729 --> 0:2:35,509
uh... but they're like you know what we
don't necessarily have to do that and


57
0:2:35,509 --> 0:2:38,669
through their experimentation and
through their sex decades they've


58
0:2:38,669 --> 0:2:39,59
realized


59
0:2:39,59 --> 0:2:42,69
they've been really truly loved each
other and they've been together for


60
0:2:42,69 --> 0:2:43,26
nineteen years


61
0:2:43,26 --> 0:2:46,93
so now they have been during all that
i'm a firm suffer ninety years in the


62
0:2:46,93 --> 0:2:48,249
side is that m_f_m_


63
0:2:48,249 --> 0:2:52,189
they go their pollyanna recess they say
they go and it's weighing these trade


64
0:2:52,189 --> 0:2:53,669
with couples and


65
0:2:53,669 --> 0:2:54,93
you know and


66
0:2:54,93 --> 0:2:57,58
evaluated all the sufferings the popeye


67
0:2:57,58 --> 0:3:1,389
of what i think it's a lot bravery for
this guy to write about this is that


68
0:3:1,389 --> 0:3:2,739
to kids that are


69
0:3:2,739 --> 0:3:4,669
pretty much grown at this point


70
0:3:4,669 --> 0:3:8,3
and they're reading a and he's breaking
all the rules in that sense


71
0:3:8,3 --> 0:3:11,41
now one thing i did agree i didn't
believe his wife to swim if ever you


72
0:3:11,41 --> 0:3:16,209
cheated and woman always says a poor the
guise of whatever it might be


73
0:3:16,209 --> 0:3:17,859
uh... it wasn't that she did


74
0:3:17,859 --> 0:3:19,339
it was that you liked it


75
0:3:19,339 --> 0:3:22,66
thank god i was a cheated out what was a
guy got a bit like


76
0:3:22,66 --> 0:3:23,79
hey you know what


77
0:3:23,79 --> 0:3:27,519
come home one day and night are largely
shop at the office in career good to me


78
0:3:27,519 --> 0:3:30,479
and a m thinking about you did you would
like that


79
0:3:30,479 --> 0:3:33,969
cake that instant you know it's not how
it's going to establish a obviously


80
0:3:33,969 --> 0:3:37,519
didn't have a problem with him and
gauging intercourse with other people


81
0:3:37,519 --> 0:3:41,659
eventually wish your listeners is hockey
tradition that goes with other guys do


82
0:3:41,659 --> 0:3:43,29
haha so


83
0:3:43,29 --> 0:3:46,199
as i was upset that everything was
happening behind your back now that


84
0:3:46,199 --> 0:3:49,12
that's what is your opinion anyone did
she went on


85
0:3:49,12 --> 0:3:55,79
acquires in that pretty much do you not
that but i think by far the worst part


86
0:3:55,79 --> 0:3:57,29
people there but mutual friends for
instance


87
0:3:57,29 --> 0:4:0,389
find out about it because then you feel
embarrassed says that this is going on


88
0:4:0,389 --> 0:4:1,209
behind that


89
0:4:1,209 --> 0:4:2,62
is that i get that


90
0:4:2,62 --> 0:4:5,74
but look at the bottom line is when they
finally came out local event


91
0:4:5,74 --> 0:4:8,15
unworthy to live with it now there's
another


92
0:4:8,15 --> 0:4:11,559
personal report closes that marc watts
not peace


93
0:4:11,559 --> 0:4:12,529
saying


94
0:4:12,529 --> 0:4:14,78
uh... when buying guys come out there
was a


95
0:4:14,78 --> 0:4:18,239
that is all anecdotal stuff it's there's
no hard research behind it but


96
0:4:18,239 --> 0:4:19,57
about a third of them


97
0:4:19,57 --> 0:4:21,28
the in need of wars


98
0:4:21,28 --> 0:4:22,37
and third


99
0:4:22,37 --> 0:4:25,5
are uh... did worse than about two years


100
0:4:25,5 --> 0:4:26,349
and therefore


101
0:4:26,349 --> 0:4:28,39
continue to have uh...


102
0:4:28,39 --> 0:4:30,149
and much more interesting marriage


103
0:4:30,149 --> 0:4:34,269
whether in illinois one of the standard
is a more open about their sexuality


104
0:4:34,269 --> 0:4:35,879
then every sentence or two


105
0:4:35,879 --> 0:4:37,429
there were people


106
0:4:37,429 --> 0:4:40,55
if they're open about it enable like
that


107
0:4:40,55 --> 0:4:45,24
had lost i wonder how many of them stay
together for the sake of their so called


108
0:4:45,24 --> 0:4:48,86
family like make sure we don't split up
because it'll be to charm attic for the


109
0:4:48,86 --> 0:4:50,3
can sure huge


110
0:4:50,3 --> 0:4:53,73
demolishes there we'd we don't really
love each other we don't care for women


111
0:4:53,73 --> 0:4:57,53
in other but we do have an understanding
that we both can and go to work on other


112
0:4:57,53 --> 0:4:59,629
people


113
0:4:59,629 --> 0:5:3,659
it if that's what pressing not known as
item that's on the depressing


114
0:5:3,659 --> 0:5:6,999
look you know you love your kids and if
europe


115
0:5:6,999 --> 0:5:11,629
any you have a mutual agreement the
latter have relations with the people


116
0:5:11,629 --> 0:7:11,629
that's what's what's that about
