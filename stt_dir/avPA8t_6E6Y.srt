0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:13,7



2
0:0:13,7 --> 0:0:16,64
ALEX OLSON: I read some stupid
thing in some skateboarder


3
0:0:16,64 --> 0:0:20,61
magazine that was like back in
the day you didn't have to--


4
0:0:20,61 --> 0:0:23,0
you'd never sponsor me tapes.


5
0:0:23,0 --> 0:0:24,99
You'd go and skate somewhere,
and people, if they thought


6
0:0:24,99 --> 0:0:27,4
you were good you'd get
sponsored, and I


7
0:0:27,4 --> 0:0:29,42
thought that was rad.


8
0:0:29,42 --> 0:0:30,815
I thought that was
the way to go.


9
0:0:30,815 --> 0:0:33,28
I probably shouldn't
have done that.


10
0:0:33,28 --> 0:0:35,14
But I guess it worked out.


11
0:0:35,14 --> 0:0:36,92
[LAUGHTER]


12
0:0:36,92 --> 0:0:37,42
ALEX OLSON: Sorry, I
was just thinking


13
0:0:37,42 --> 0:0:37,985
of something retarded.


14
0:0:37,985 --> 0:0:39,49
OK, what?


15
0:0:39,49 --> 0:0:40,66
PATRICK O'DELL: Hi, welcome
back to the


16
0:0:40,66 --> 0:0:42,3
Epicly Later'd Show.


17
0:0:42,3 --> 0:0:44,99
This episode is about Alex
Olson, who I've known for a


18
0:0:44,99 --> 0:0:45,88
really long time.


19
0:0:45,88 --> 0:0:50,62
And I've seen him change from
being this little kid, to


20
0:0:50,62 --> 0:0:56,8
being this really awesome
grown-up skater.


21
0:0:56,8 --> 0:0:59,46
He's like the kind of pros they
used to have in the '80s,


22
0:0:59,46 --> 0:1:4,36
where it was just pure skill
and not much hype about how


23
0:1:4,36 --> 0:1:5,92
they dressed or anything.


24
0:1:5,92 --> 0:1:9,38
He looks like he was
just made to skate.


25
0:1:9,38 --> 0:1:10,73
Alex right now is filming
for the Lakai


26
0:1:10,73 --> 0:1:12,545
video, which is probably--


27
0:1:12,545 --> 0:1:13,74
it's definitely one of the most


28
0:1:13,74 --> 0:1:16,11
anticipated videos in years.


29
0:1:16,11 --> 0:1:18,4
And Alex is going to have
his first part in that.


30
0:1:18,4 --> 0:1:20,87
He's never had a real part
in a real skate video.


31
0:1:20,87 --> 0:1:21,96
And so that's a lot
of pressure.


32
0:1:21,96 --> 0:1:25,12
And right now he's filming to
be in this video with Koston


33
0:1:25,12 --> 0:1:28,39
and Guy Mariano, which is a
huge thing to live up to.


34
0:1:28,39 --> 0:1:32,87
Do you feel a lot of pressure
for the Lakai video?


35
0:1:32,87 --> 0:1:34,62
ALEX OLSON: It's coming
on slowly.


36
0:1:34,62 --> 0:1:36,69
It's coming on.


37
0:1:36,69 --> 0:1:38,74
It's stressful.


38
0:1:38,74 --> 0:1:40,276
There's so much riding
on the video.


39
0:1:40,276 --> 0:1:42,7
It's kind of making
me nervous.


40
0:1:42,7 --> 0:1:45,43
I've stressed out
so much already.


41
0:1:45,43 --> 0:1:46,29
-When's it due?


42
0:1:46,29 --> 0:1:48,79
ALEX OLSON: I've shed
tears, all right?


43
0:1:48,79 --> 0:1:50,8
I have.


44
0:1:50,8 --> 0:1:51,19
You know what?


45
0:1:51,19 --> 0:1:54,4
Honestly, there's too much
riding on this video.


46
0:1:54,4 --> 0:1:56,89
And people have such high
expectations for it, that


47
0:1:56,89 --> 0:2:0,3
people are expecting so
much that they're


48
0:2:0,3 --> 0:2:1,66
going to be let down.


49
0:2:1,66 --> 0:2:3,32
TY EVANS: I don't think
he likes filming.


50
0:2:3,32 --> 0:2:6,245
I don't think anyone likes
filming for that matter, but I


51
0:2:6,245 --> 0:2:7,47
was like this spot's
sick, right?


52
0:2:7,47 --> 0:2:10,6
And he was like fucking sucks.


53
0:2:10,6 --> 0:2:11,23
All right rad.


54
0:2:11,23 --> 0:2:13,58
Maybe that's his way of
saying he likes it.


55
0:2:13,58 --> 0:2:15,99
He's always pissed at something,
mad at something,


56
0:2:15,99 --> 0:2:17,43
something sucks.


57
0:2:17,43 --> 0:2:19,52
Sports sucks.


58
0:2:19,52 --> 0:2:21,98
The spot sucks.


59
0:2:21,98 --> 0:2:24,4
MARC JOHNSON: I think he just
sort of does his own thing in


60
0:2:24,4 --> 0:2:24,71
his own time.


61
0:2:24,71 --> 0:2:27,72
And when one thing about Alex,
I don't think he's impressed


62
0:2:27,72 --> 0:2:28,71
by very much.


63
0:2:28,71 --> 0:2:30,99
Kind of puts you off when you
do a really rad trick


64
0:2:30,99 --> 0:2:32,24
and he's just like.


65
0:2:32,24 --> 0:2:35,28



66
0:2:35,28 --> 0:2:37,78
Naw, I'm just kidding.


67
0:2:37,78 --> 0:2:39,58
AARON MEZA: For sure, Alex got
on Girl, and he was probably


68
0:2:39,58 --> 0:2:43,33
the least enthusiastic about
it out of anybody in the


69
0:2:43,33 --> 0:2:45,18
history of the company.


70
0:2:45,18 --> 0:2:46,26
Right.


71
0:2:46,26 --> 0:2:48,58
Completely unimpressed with
the phone call, like hey


72
0:2:48,58 --> 0:2:49,61
you're getting on Girl.


73
0:2:49,61 --> 0:2:50,96
Now they called to
shoot an ad.


74
0:2:50,96 --> 0:2:54,22
We wanted to do a certain ad,
and he didn't want to do it.


75
0:2:54,22 --> 0:2:55,62
And because of that--


76
0:2:55,62 --> 0:2:56,38
-Fucking lame.


77
0:2:56,38 --> 0:2:57,87
AARON MEZA: Because of that he
was like, can I just ride for


78
0:2:57,87 --> 0:2:59,59
chocolate instead?


79
0:2:59,59 --> 0:3:1,64
This is Carroll junior.


80
0:3:1,64 --> 0:3:4,591
This is Mike Carroll's
revenge.


81
0:3:4,591 --> 0:3:7,28
He has to deal with somebody
now that he was


82
0:3:7,28 --> 0:3:9,39
like at that age.


83
0:3:9,39 --> 0:3:14,14
MIKE CARROLL: I'm curious if I
was that bad, but I can see to


84
0:3:14,14 --> 0:3:17,21
a certain sense that he's doing
the same shit that I've


85
0:3:17,21 --> 0:3:21,325
done to annoy people.


86
0:3:21,325 --> 0:3:23,64
I don't think he'll ever
wear a Girl shirt.


87
0:3:23,64 --> 0:3:29,92
He'll make sure he'll wear a
fucking Jason Jesse shirt, or


88
0:3:29,92 --> 0:3:30,74
something else.


89
0:3:30,74 --> 0:3:33,3
-You should put on a Girl
skateboard shirt.


90
0:3:33,3 --> 0:3:34,376
ALEX OLSON: No, I'll put
a Quicksilver shirt on.


91
0:3:34,376 --> 0:3:35,744
How about that?


92
0:3:35,744 --> 0:3:38,62
Yeah, I should but
whatever I don't.


93
0:3:38,62 --> 0:3:48,23



94
0:3:48,23 --> 0:3:50,63
-He was the last probably, the
first person in a long time to


95
0:3:50,63 --> 0:3:52,73
get on Girl.


96
0:3:52,73 --> 0:3:56,63
Just as dude hanging out that
was a friend, that just


97
0:3:56,63 --> 0:3:58,7
eventually got on the team.


98
0:3:58,7 --> 0:4:1,43
It was old style like this
dude's sick, he's our friend.


99
0:4:1,43 --> 0:4:2,59
Like, let's hook him up.


100
0:4:2,59 --> 0:4:3,41
Even though everybody
already knew who he


101
0:4:3,41 --> 0:4:5,91
was already in skating.


102
0:4:5,91 --> 0:4:8,94
ALEX OLSON: Well Supreme opened
up, when I was in LA,


103
0:4:8,94 --> 0:4:12,86
and they had a bowl
to skate in there.


104
0:4:12,86 --> 0:4:15,857
So all these pros would come in
there, and I go skate the


105
0:4:15,857 --> 0:4:20,29
bowl with them, and I met like
all the Girl guys from that.


106
0:4:20,29 --> 0:4:21,3
MIKE CARROLL: We were just
skating with him a lot.


107
0:4:21,3 --> 0:4:24,12
When we first started skating
with him, we didn't think that


108
0:4:24,12 --> 0:4:25,95
he was actually trying
to be a sponsor guy.


109
0:4:25,95 --> 0:4:30,3
He was just skating around being
just a kid, going around


110
0:4:30,3 --> 0:4:31,35
skating with people.


111
0:4:31,35 --> 0:4:33,32
I think there's a lot
of the same skater.


112
0:4:33,32 --> 0:4:36,31
And I feel like he's a different
type of skater.


113
0:4:36,31 --> 0:4:39,0
It just seemed like a natural
thing that he should be on.


114
0:4:39,0 --> 0:4:42,57



115
0:4:42,57 --> 0:4:44,31
-Glory days.


116
0:4:44,31 --> 0:4:45,78
1994.


117
0:4:45,78 --> 0:4:47,585
This is Mike Carroll's skater
of the year trophy.


118
0:4:47,585 --> 0:4:52,5



119
0:4:52,5 --> 0:4:53,91
Parking block.


120
0:4:53,91 --> 0:4:57,1
Never figured that out. until
about three months ago.


121
0:4:57,1 --> 0:4:58,962
-Hey Alex, you can't
listen right now.


122
0:4:58,962 --> 0:4:59,45
ALEX OLSON: OK.


123
0:4:59,45 --> 0:5:1,14
-Leave.


124
0:5:1,14 --> 0:5:4,9
I think for him it might be
weird, because he looks the


125
0:5:4,9 --> 0:5:6,44
best just in real life.


126
0:5:6,44 --> 0:5:8,9
Like someone like Dennis
Busenitz, or Julian.


127
0:5:8,9 --> 0:5:13,45
In real life they look good on
video, but if you're lucky


128
0:5:13,45 --> 0:5:19,78
enough to see Julian skate in
real life, it's way different.


129
0:5:19,78 --> 0:5:23,245
-Dude is ripping like
a seasoned pro.


130
0:5:23,245 --> 0:5:26,87
He's a young dude but really
old, like up here.


131
0:5:26,87 --> 0:5:29,59
I'm glad that in this day
and age there are


132
0:5:29,59 --> 0:5:30,95
still people like Alex.


133
0:5:30,95 --> 0:5:32,48
skating.


134
0:5:32,48 --> 0:5:35,76
He just defies all categories.


135
0:5:35,76 --> 0:5:37,94
You've got this kind of group,
and this kind of group, and


136
0:5:37,94 --> 0:5:38,75
this kind of--


137
0:5:38,75 --> 0:5:42,11
Alex is way over here.


138
0:5:42,11 --> 0:5:44,63
-In a lot of ways, he's kind
of like an old soul.


139
0:5:44,63 --> 0:5:47,4
Like, especially about skating,
with Steve his dad,


140
0:5:47,4 --> 0:5:49,91
being a pro skater
from the '70s.


141
0:5:49,91 --> 0:5:52,35
He had some serious early--


142
0:5:52,35 --> 0:5:56,4
he probably got steered a good
direction really fast.


143
0:5:56,4 --> 0:5:57,49
There's something in
the blood I guess.


144
0:5:57,49 --> 0:6:16,83



145
0:6:16,83 --> 0:6:18,0
-Standard issue.


146
0:6:18,0 --> 0:6:18,92
Welcome to California.


147
0:6:18,92 --> 0:6:20,485
That's what they said.


148
0:6:20,485 --> 0:6:23,1
Welcome to California.


149
0:6:23,1 --> 0:6:25,745
You're not really
causing damage.


150
0:6:25,745 --> 0:6:29,89
It's a piece of metal, and
you're on your board on the


151
0:6:29,89 --> 0:6:30,59
metal, too.


152
0:6:30,59 --> 0:6:33,136
It's like the best was,
yeah, we didn't


153
0:6:33,136 --> 0:6:33,95
know you could skate.


154
0:6:33,95 --> 0:6:36,53
No, man, I know that you know
that you're not allowed to.


155
0:6:36,53 --> 0:6:37,25
No, dude.


156
0:6:37,25 --> 0:6:38,446
It's my first time here.


157
0:6:38,446 --> 0:6:39,626
There's no signs anywhere.


158
0:6:39,626 --> 0:6:43,42
Well there was a sign here,
but still, you play dumb.


159
0:6:43,42 --> 0:6:45,76
How many times has
that happened?


160
0:6:45,76 --> 0:6:46,84
Thousands.


161
0:6:46,84 --> 0:6:50,85
Million Fuck.


162
0:6:50,85 --> 0:6:52,83
Billions.


163
0:6:52,83 --> 0:6:56,38
It's the same song and dance
no matter where you are.


164
0:6:56,38 --> 0:6:59,95



165
0:6:59,95 --> 0:7:10,273



166
0:7:10,273 --> 0:7:11,2
STEVE OLSON: Come in.


167
0:7:11,2 --> 0:7:14,83
-We went over to Alex's to
interview his dad Steve Olson,


168
0:7:14,83 --> 0:7:17,87
who is a pro skater
from the '70s.


169
0:7:17,87 --> 0:7:20,87
I believe Steve did mostly
slalom and downhill.


170
0:7:20,87 --> 0:7:23,82
But he skates pools,
vert, straight.


171
0:7:23,82 --> 0:7:25,326
And he still skates now.


172
0:7:25,326 --> 0:7:32,67



173
0:7:32,67 --> 0:7:36,56
STEVE OLSON: That's a picture
of Alex when he was seven.


174
0:7:36,56 --> 0:7:38,65
You should do a show on him.


175
0:7:38,65 --> 0:7:40,9
-I want to.


176
0:7:40,9 --> 0:7:43,13
STEVE OLSON: Oh yeah, right.


177
0:7:43,13 --> 0:7:44,86
-You guys both said that.


178
0:7:44,86 --> 0:7:45,82
STEVE OLSON: [LAUGHTER]


179
0:7:45,82 --> 0:7:47,26
Imagine that.


180
0:7:47,26 --> 0:7:48,51
Why would we do one together?


181
0:7:48,51 --> 0:7:50,98



182
0:7:50,98 --> 0:7:52,44
STEVE OLSON: Him
and I together?


183
0:7:52,44 --> 0:7:55,66
Are you kidding me?


184
0:7:55,66 --> 0:8:0,8
-So Alex finally said that
we can interview


185
0:8:0,8 --> 0:8:1,71
him and his dad together.


186
0:8:1,71 --> 0:8:4,19
We spent most of the day sitting
around waiting for


187
0:8:4,19 --> 0:8:5,97
Steve to show up.


188
0:8:5,97 --> 0:8:8,3
Then finally he showed up.


189
0:8:8,3 --> 0:8:11,59
And I sat them down together,
and got an interview.


190
0:8:11,59 --> 0:8:15,1
STEVE OLSON: Alex started
skating basically around this


191
0:8:15,1 --> 0:8:19,58
little square at my mom
and dad's house.


192
0:8:19,58 --> 0:8:21,17
-How old was he?


193
0:8:21,17 --> 0:8:22,33
STEVE OLSON: Three.


194
0:8:22,33 --> 0:8:23,18
ALEX OLSON: You're an idiot.


195
0:8:23,18 --> 0:8:25,73
I was not three, or
four, or five.


196
0:8:25,73 --> 0:8:26,46
STEVE OLSON: How old were you?


197
0:8:26,46 --> 0:8:26,85
Two?


198
0:8:26,85 --> 0:8:28,15
ALEX OLSON: Seven or eight.


199
0:8:28,15 --> 0:8:30,51
STEVE OLSON: Bullshit.


200
0:8:30,51 --> 0:8:31,63
Oh my God.


201
0:8:31,63 --> 0:8:35,919
This is the worst thing I've
ever done in my life.


202
0:8:35,919 --> 0:8:37,286
What's this for anyway?


203
0:8:37,286 --> 0:8:38,23
-Don't worry about it.


204
0:8:38,23 --> 0:8:39,49
-A skate show.


205
0:8:39,49 --> 0:8:40,725
STEVE OLSON: Skate show?


206
0:8:40,725 --> 0:8:42,66
Like skate TV?


207
0:8:42,66 --> 0:8:43,6
-Have you seen it?


208
0:8:43,6 --> 0:8:44,81
STEVE OLSON: No.


209
0:8:44,81 --> 0:8:47,59
-Would you say Alex is more
responsible than you?


210
0:8:47,59 --> 0:8:49,706
STEVE OLSON: Totally.


211
0:8:49,706 --> 0:8:50,883
Oh, you act like you're 20.


212
0:8:50,883 --> 0:8:52,276
No, I'm 45.


213
0:8:52,276 --> 0:8:54,13
I act 45.


214
0:8:54,13 --> 0:8:56,38
ALEX OLSON: You definitely
don't act like you're 45.


215
0:8:56,38 --> 0:8:59,4
STEVE OLSON: Where are the rules
and regulations how old


216
0:8:59,4 --> 0:9:0,2
you have to act?


217
0:9:0,2 --> 0:9:1,16
ALEX OLSON: There are no
rules or regulations.


218
0:9:1,16 --> 0:9:6,39
It's just people that are your
age act differently than--


219
0:9:6,39 --> 0:9:7,2
STEVE OLSON: How I act.


220
0:9:7,2 --> 0:9:8,36
ALEX OLSON: Yes.


221
0:9:8,36 --> 0:9:9,25
Exactly.


222
0:9:9,25 --> 0:9:14,45
STEVE OLSON: So that
means what?


223
0:9:14,45 --> 0:9:15,72
Who give me the most
shit in my life?


224
0:9:15,72 --> 0:9:18,29
My son.


225
0:9:18,29 --> 0:9:20,37
-He's like your new mom?


226
0:9:20,37 --> 0:9:21,62
STEVE OLSON: No.


227
0:9:21,62 --> 0:9:23,93



228
0:9:23,93 --> 0:9:26,21
I can't get milk out
of his [INAUDIBLE].


229
0:9:26,21 --> 0:9:30,92



230
0:9:30,92 --> 0:9:33,1
And those cans that
you brought back?


231
0:9:33,1 --> 0:9:33,84
Suck.


232
0:9:33,84 --> 0:9:35,1
ALEX OLSON: Well guess what?


233
0:9:35,1 --> 0:9:35,79
Fuck you.


234
0:9:35,79 --> 0:9:37,4
STEVE OLSON: Yes.


235
0:9:37,4 --> 0:9:39,1



236
0:9:39,1 --> 0:9:41,86
ALEX OLSON: I live
with my dad now.


237
0:9:41,86 --> 0:9:44,18
And now his girlfriend
moved in.


238
0:9:44,18 --> 0:9:45,34
With her dog.


239
0:9:45,34 --> 0:9:48,26
And you saw how big
the place was.


240
0:9:48,26 --> 0:9:49,14
It's fucked.


241
0:9:49,14 --> 0:9:50,35
I hate it.


242
0:9:50,35 --> 0:9:51,3
-What?


243
0:9:51,3 --> 0:9:53,41
ALEX OLSON: I don't know
It's just bad.


244
0:9:53,41 --> 0:9:58,8
Well there's like that weird
couch, bed thing that--


245
0:9:58,8 --> 0:9:58,9
-Over by the motorcycle?


246
0:9:58,9 --> 0:10:1,31
ALEX OLSON: So he'll
just switch off.


247
0:10:1,31 --> 0:10:3,37
I don't know.


248
0:10:3,37 --> 0:10:6,7
I need to get my own place.


249
0:10:6,7 --> 0:10:7,473
I need to find a rich
girlfriend and


250
0:10:7,473 --> 0:10:8,7
just stay at her place.


251
0:10:8,7 --> 0:10:10,4
-What is that like going
and having a


252
0:10:10,4 --> 0:10:11,135
drink with your father?


253
0:10:11,135 --> 0:10:13,92
ALEX OLSON: It's embarrassing
because you try to


254
0:10:13,92 --> 0:10:14,36
pawn me off to girls.


255
0:10:14,36 --> 0:10:17,59



256
0:10:17,59 --> 0:10:19,91
STEVE OLSON: What are
you talking about?


257
0:10:19,91 --> 0:10:23,18
ALEX OLSON: I just told you.


258
0:10:23,18 --> 0:10:25,115
STEVE OLSON: I try to pawn
you off onto chicks?


259
0:10:25,115 --> 0:10:27,274
ALEX OLSON: Yeah.


260
0:10:27,274 --> 0:10:28,49
STEVE OLSON: This is my son.


261
0:10:28,49 --> 0:10:29,36
You guys should hook up.


262
0:10:29,36 --> 0:10:31,205
ALEX OLSON: Yup.


263
0:10:31,205 --> 0:10:33,83
-Did you home school Alex?


264
0:10:33,83 --> 0:10:37,84
STEVE OLSON: No, I
un-schooled Alex.


265
0:10:37,84 --> 0:10:39,36
Don't ever touch my
finger again.


266
0:10:39,36 --> 0:10:41,22
-I thought you home schooled.


267
0:10:41,22 --> 0:10:43,19
STEVE OLSON: I pulled him out
of school to un-school him,


268
0:10:43,19 --> 0:10:45,85
and take him out of the trap.


269
0:10:45,85 --> 0:10:46,525
-And how did--


270
0:10:46,525 --> 0:10:47,88
STEVE OLSON: the trap.


271
0:10:47,88 --> 0:10:50,336
-Did you teach him
how to read?


272
0:10:50,336 --> 0:10:52,89
STEVE OLSON: No, I taught
him how to make himself


273
0:10:52,89 --> 0:10:55,16
learn how to read.


274
0:10:55,16 --> 0:11:0,19
-Alex, how did that work
being home schooled?


275
0:11:0,19 --> 0:11:0,71
STEVE OLSON: No, no, no.


276
0:11:0,71 --> 0:11:3,14
It's called un-schooled.


277
0:11:3,14 --> 0:11:4,15
ALEX OLSON: Shut up for once.


278
0:11:4,15 --> 0:11:5,58
STEVE OLSON: Dude, what
are you talking about?


279
0:11:5,58 --> 0:11:6,51
That's what it was called.


280
0:11:6,51 --> 0:11:7,185
ALEX OLSON: It was
called un-school?


281
0:11:7,185 --> 0:11:8,75
STEVE OLSON: Do you want me to
show you the fucking thing?


282
0:11:8,75 --> 0:11:9,29
ALEX OLSON: Yeah, I would
love to see it.


283
0:11:9,29 --> 0:11:10,185
STEVE OLSON: It was called
un-schooling.


284
0:11:10,185 --> 0:11:12,1
There's all sorts of different
programs for it.


285
0:11:12,1 --> 0:11:13,41
ALEX OLSON: Let's see
it big mouth.


286
0:11:13,41 --> 0:11:14,6
STEVE OLSON: We'll have
to go online.


287
0:11:14,6 --> 0:11:15,68
ALEX OLSON: All right.


288
0:11:15,68 --> 0:11:17,774
STEVE OLSON: Too bad the
internet's down right now.


289
0:11:17,774 --> 0:11:18,236
ALEX OLSON: Exactly.


290
0:11:18,236 --> 0:11:18,7
That's bullshit.


291
0:11:18,7 --> 0:11:20,64
There's no such thing.


292
0:11:20,64 --> 0:11:22,98
STEVE OLSON: Are you crazed?


293
0:11:22,98 --> 0:11:23,97
ALEX OLSON: What?


294
0:11:23,97 --> 0:11:25,555
-He said it runs
in the family.


295
0:11:25,555 --> 0:11:27,155
STEVE OLSON: I never focused
my skateboard


296
0:11:27,155 --> 0:11:28,72
in my entire life.


297
0:11:28,72 --> 0:11:30,49
ALEX OLSON: That doesn't mean
you don't have a bad temper.


298
0:11:30,49 --> 0:11:31,975
STEVE OLSON: I don't
have a bad temper.


299
0:11:31,975 --> 0:11:32,893
ALEX OLSON: Yes you do.


300
0:11:32,893 --> 0:11:33,98
STEVE OLSON: Oh my god.


301
0:11:33,98 --> 0:11:35,334
How do I have a bad temper?


302
0:11:35,334 --> 0:11:35,811
ALEX OLSON: I've seen it.


303
0:11:35,811 --> 0:11:36,288
Don't try to cover that up.


304
0:11:36,288 --> 0:11:39,15
You have a bad temper.


305
0:11:39,15 --> 0:11:41,58
STEVE OLSON: Well when I'm
pushed to the edge.


306
0:11:41,58 --> 0:11:42,5
ALEX OLSON: You have
a bad temper.


307
0:11:42,5 --> 0:11:43,42
We all have bad tempers.


308
0:11:43,42 --> 0:11:46,314
STEVE OLSON: Don't push
me to [INAUDIBLE].


309
0:11:46,314 --> 0:11:49,65
[LAUGHTER]


310
0:11:49,65 --> 0:11:53,18
What is the next question?


311
0:11:53,18 --> 0:11:55,41
-I just like watching
you guys riff.


312
0:11:55,41 --> 0:11:58,3
Big happy family together.


313
0:11:58,3 --> 0:12:0,926
STEVE OLSON: You want
to see him snap?


314
0:12:0,926 --> 0:12:2,22
Or not?


315
0:12:2,22 --> 0:12:9,935
Do you want to see your guy,
the subject matter, snap?


316
0:12:9,935 --> 0:12:12,37
That's not nice.


317
0:12:12,37 --> 0:12:13,92
-I'm not making him snap.


318
0:12:13,92 --> 0:12:15,41
STEVE OLSON: I would never
make him snap.


319
0:12:15,41 --> 0:12:17,17
I could just say one thing
and he'll snap.


320
0:12:17,17 --> 0:12:18,35
ALEX OLSON: What is that?


321
0:12:18,35 --> 0:12:20,593
STEVE OLSON: I'm God.


322
0:12:20,593 --> 0:12:22,517
[LAUGHTER]


323
0:12:22,517 --> 0:12:23,767
ALEX OLSON: Come on.


324
0:12:23,767 --> 0:12:27,808



325
0:12:27,808 --> 0:12:29,14
STEVE OLSON: I can't help it.


326
0:12:29,14 --> 0:12:31,2
I really dig my son.


327
0:12:31,2 --> 0:12:35,12
Whatever he says, you never take
away how much I dig him.


328
0:12:35,12 --> 0:12:36,37
Understand that?


329
0:12:36,37 --> 0:12:37,79
All you other fucking parents
out there should


330
0:12:37,79 --> 0:12:39,57
maybe take this lead.


331
0:12:39,57 --> 0:12:41,8
Fucking roll with it.


332
0:12:41,8 --> 0:12:43,17
You're an idiot, dad.


333
0:12:43,17 --> 0:14:43,17
