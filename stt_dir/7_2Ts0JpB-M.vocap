###3 This is our world
###5 a warm, comfortable, familiar place
###11 But walk away from the fire and look up
###15 our thoughts soon leave home
###18 Are we just insignificant specks?
###21 Is the universe welcoming or hostile?
###26 We could stand here forever wondering
###32 or we could turn our back on this beach, leave home
###38 to see the universe, from here to its edge
###46 to discover its wonders
###50 confront its horrors
###55 beautiful new worlds
###59 malevolent dark forces
###66 the beginning of time
###70 the end of the world
###74 Would we have the courage to see it through
###79 or would we run for home?
###83 There is only one way to find out
###107 The edge of space
###110 only 100km up, just an hour's drive from home
###118 Down there, life continues
###120 The traffic keeps moving
###122 stocks go on trading and Star Trek is still showing
###141 But we have to leave all this behind
###147 To dip our toe into the vast dark ocean beyond
###156 Into the shallows
###158 not too far from home
###162 onto.. the moon
###185 Dozens of astronauts have come this way before us
###189 12 of them have walked on the moon itself
###195 Just over 400,000km from home
###199 3 days in a spacecraft
###201 So close, it's as if we've barely left home
###209 Familiar, safe
###212 within the sight of earth
###219 It looks like a deserted battlefield
###221 bombarded by millions of meteorites and asteroids
###226 But it's quieter now
###228 It's obvious there have been no major collisions for millions of years
###237 This brings back memories
###239 the Apollo 11, lunar module
###245 Neil Armstrong's first footprints
###249 looks like they were made yesterday
###251 there is no air to change them
###254 They should survive for millions of years
###259 may be longer than us
###267 Our time is limited
###269 We need to take our own giant leap
###275 further than any human as ever travels
###284 Out of the darkness, a friendly face
###289 the goddess of love
###291 Venus
###294 The morning star, the evening star
###299 Sometimes she welcomes the new day in the east
###302 others she says good night in the west
###306 The planet's spectacular yellow clouds reflect the sunlight
###311 That's why this is the solar system's brightest planet
###316 a sister to our planet
###318 She is about the same size and gravity as earth
###322 We should be safe here
###326 But the Venus Express space probe is telling us these dazzling clouds
###331 are made of deadly sulfuric acid
###334 that the planet's atmosphere is choked with carbon dioxide
###339 It's ringing alarm bells
###346 Venus is one angry goddess
###352 The air is noxious,
###354 the pressure unbearable
###356 and it's hot,
###358 approaching 500 degree Celsius
###362 Stay too long
###363 and we'd be corroded, suffocated, crushed and baked
###374 Noting can survive here
###378 Like this,
###379 it's a Soviet Venera robotic probe
###382 its heavy armor has been wrecked by the extreme atmosphere
###398 So lovely from earth,
###399 up close, this goddess is hideous
###417 She is the sister from hell
###419 pockmarked by thousands of volcanos
###423 All that carbon dioxide in its atmosphere is trapping the sun's heat
###427 This is global warming gone wild
###431 Before it was cold, maybe Venus was calm
###434 more like her sister planet earth
###439 If that's true, this could be our planet's future
###449 Beginning to think we shouldn't be out here
###452 that we should turn back
###455 But there's something hypnotic about the sun
###459 Like Medusa, too terrible to look at, too powerful to resist
###465 luring us onwards,
###467 on, like a moth to a flame
###472 Dwarfed by, scorched by the sun,
###476 it's Mercury
###479 Get too close to the sun, this is what happens
###484 Temperature swing wildly here
###487 At night, it's -170 degrees
###491 come midday, it's 400+
###495 burnt, frozen
###497 and look at those scars
###500 a sign that Mercury had a violent past
###505 The Messenger space probe, it's telling us something strange
###510 For its size, this little planet has a powerful gravitational pull
###514 It must be heavier than it looks
###517 It's like a huge ball of iron covered with a thin veneer of rock
###522 The core of what was once much larger planet
###528 Maybe a stray planet slammed into Mercury
###532 blasting away its out layers in a deadly game of cosmic pinball
###540 Whole planets on the loose
###542 destroying anything in their path, even entire planets
###546 and we are in the middle of it:
###548 vulnerable, exposed, small
###553 everything is telling us to turn back
###557 but who could defy this
###560 the sun, in all its mesmerizing splendor
###566 Our light, our lives
###570 Everything we do is controlled by the sun
###574 depends on it
###576 and more than that
###577 it's the Greek god Helios driving his chariot across the sky
###582 The Egyptian god Ra, reborn everyday
###585 the summer solstice sun rising at Stonehenge
###589 For millions of years
###591 this was as close as it got to staring into the face of god
###598 150 million kilometers from home
###601 a 20-year journey by plane
###605 switch it off
###607 and it's so far away
###609 we wouldn't know about it for a whole 8 minutes
###615 It's so big, you could fit a million earths inside it
###622 So heavy, its gravity controls the entire solar system
###633 But who needs numbers
###635 we've got the real thing
###640 We see it everyday
###642 a familiar face in our sky
###646 up close, it's unrecognizable
###651 a turbulent sea of incandescent gas
###656 The thermometer rises to over 5,000 degrees
###663 Down in the core,
###664 it's got to be tens of millions of degrees
###677 Hot enough to trigger a nuclear reaction
###680 turning millions of tons of matter into energy, every second
###686 More than all the energy ever made by mankind
###691 Back home, we see this energy as light
###694 feel it as heat
###699 But up close, there is nothing comforting about the sun
###705 It's so full of electrical and magnetic activity
###708 It's bursting out in this huge incandescent gas loops called prominences
###716 Each one releasing more energy than ten million volcanos
###720 You could get the earth through one of these loops
###723 and still have tens of thousands of kilometers to spare
###733 And when they burst through
###735 it's exposing a cooler layers below
###738 making sunspots
###742 They're a fraction cooler than their surroundings
###746 it's why they look black
###747 but they are still hotter than anything on earth
###750 and they are massive too
###752 Some of these are at least 50,000km across
###758 a solar flare
###761 a superheated stream of electrified gas
###763 blasting deadly radiation out into space
###770 But one day, all this will stop
###774 the sun's fuel will be spent
###782 When it dies, that will be it for the earth as well
###790 This god creates life and destroys it
###795 demands we keep our distance
###805 This comet has strayed too close
###809 It's been boiled away by the sun's heat
###812 creating a tail stretches for millions of kilometers
###827 It's freezing in here
###829 There's no doubt where these comets come from
###832 the icy wastes of deep space
###836 But look at all these steam, the geysers and dust
###841 it's the sun again, melting the comet's frozen heart
###846 A kind of vast dirty snowball covered in grimy tar
