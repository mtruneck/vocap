1
0:0:7,374 --> 0:0:13,146
Five hundred years before Christ
a young prince set out on a journey.


2
0:0:13,146 --> 0:0:16,983
He would travel through pain
and suffering to reach nirvana


3
0:0:16,983 --> 0:0:20,286
- the everlasting bliss we all dream of.


4
0:0:20,286 --> 0:0:23,556
Symbol of peace


5
0:0:23,556 --> 0:0:30,63
Symbol of compassion,
symbol of non-violence.


6
0:0:30,63 --> 0:0:33,933
He was the Buddha.


7
0:0:33,933 --> 0:0:37,837
He grew up in a palace surrounded
by luxury.


8
0:0:37,837 --> 0:0:43,977
In his teens his privilege afforded him
every indulgence


9
0:0:43,977 --> 0:0:51,484
But he gave all this up
- to gain ultimate wisdom.


10
0:0:51,484 --> 0:0:55,688
He would travel the darkest corridors
of his mind to come face to face


11
0:0:55,688 --> 0:0:59,492
with the devil inside him.


12
0:0:59,492 --> 0:1:1,861
He founded the first world religion,


13
0:1:1,861 --> 0:1:5,765
followed today by over 400 million people


14
0:1:5,765 --> 0:1:8,301
- a religion where
meditation is used to reach


15
0:1:8,301 --> 0:1:12,505
a state of complete peace and happiness.


16
0:1:12,505 --> 0:1:15,575
Our own potential our own effort


17
0:1:15,575 --> 0:1:20,8
to know the ultimate reality.


18
0:1:20,8 --> 0:1:22,582
And the events of his life make up one of


19
0:1:22,582 --> 0:1:24,918
the greatest stories ever told


20
0:1:24,918 --> 0:1:40,6
- and the Buddha the world's most
enduring icon.


21
0:1:40,6 --> 0:1:46,739
Two and a half thousand years after
his death the Buddha's message lives on.


22
0:1:46,739 --> 0:1:48,74
The Dalai Lama


23
0:1:48,74 --> 0:1:50,844
- the spiritual figurehead of
Tibetan Buddhism


24
0:1:50,844 --> 0:1:53,46
- passes on the teachings of the Buddha


25
0:1:53,46 --> 0:1:58,952
- continuing a practice that
began the day he died.


26
0:1:58,952 --> 0:2:4,724
Buddhism has been adopted by many different
cultures and has many interpretations.


27
0:2:4,724 --> 0:2:7,26
The Buddha's teachings of
a higher mental calm


28
0:2:7,26 --> 0:2:13,7
and clarity are seen by some as a religion,
others a philosophy, even a psychotherapy.


29
0:2:13,7 --> 0:2:17,17
Some people
describe Buddhism is not a religion


30
0:2:17,17 --> 0:2:21,374
but Buddhism is science of mind.


31
0:2:21,374 --> 0:2:23,81
The Buddha's message is as relevant today


32
0:2:23,81 --> 0:2:26,88
as it was two
and a half thousand years ago.


33
0:2:26,88 --> 0:2:29,115
What has made Buddhism so popular


34
0:2:29,115 --> 0:2:32,218
is that it is insightful
and largely true that


35
0:2:32,218 --> 0:2:36,456
the Buddha discovered
immensely important things.


36
0:2:36,456 --> 0:2:38,591
Unlike other religions, Buddhism,


37
0:2:38,591 --> 0:2:41,995
which centers on the mind,
has no supreme God.


38
0:2:41,995 --> 0:2:47,867
Instead a great teacher
- the Buddha or the Awakened One.


39
0:2:47,867 --> 0:2:51,838
It seems very almost intuitive to an age


40
0:2:51,838 --> 0:2:56,342
in which psychology becomes for many people
an alternative to religion


41
0:2:56,342 --> 0:2:59,112
it's the means it's a therapeutic means


42
0:2:59,112 --> 0:3:1,314
to dealing with the problems of life


43
0:3:1,314 --> 0:3:5,518
and so it seems very accessible
to many people.


44
0:3:5,518 --> 0:3:8,321
There are many representations
of the Buddha


45
0:3:8,321 --> 0:3:13,59
- and Buddhists all have their own picture
in their minds of what he was like.


46
0:3:13,59 --> 0:3:24,304
Some kind of vibration of complete peace,
non-violence I think that must be there.


47
0:3:24,304 --> 0:3:27,106
Until little more than
one hundred years ago


48
0:3:27,106 --> 0:3:31,244
the life of the Buddha remained unknown
to the West.


49
0:3:31,244 --> 0:3:33,713
By the time the British colonized India


50
0:3:33,713 --> 0:3:38,184
- the country of the Buddha's birth
- Buddhism had all but died out,


51
0:3:38,184 --> 0:3:42,522
destroyed by Hindu kings
and Muslim invaders.


52
0:3:42,522 --> 0:3:47,927
The origins and the sites of
the Buddha's life became lost to everyone.


53
0:3:47,927 --> 0:3:50,663
It wasn't until
British colonial archaeologists


54
0:3:50,663 --> 0:3:53,967
began to explore Northern India
that their discoveries


55
0:3:53,967 --> 0:3:58,805
began to root the Buddha's life
in historical fact.


56
0:3:58,805 --> 0:4:0,34
In the 1860's,


57
0:4:0,34 --> 0:4:3,142
a series of archaeologists began to try


58
0:4:3,142 --> 0:4:8,581
and identify the sites associated
with the life of the Buddha.


59
0:4:8,581 --> 0:4:11,417
By the 1890's many of these sites


60
0:4:11,417 --> 0:4:16,122
had been successfully identified
within the Ganges area,


61
0:4:16,122 --> 0:4:21,194
but that time two of the great sites
connected with Buddhism were still missing,


62
0:4:21,194 --> 0:4:24,564
the site of Lumbini,
where the Buddha had actually been born,


63
0:4:24,564 --> 0:4:30,3
and the site of Kapilavastu
which was the childhood home of the Buddha.


64
0:4:30,3 --> 0:4:33,606
The area to the north of the Ganges
was less well known,


65
0:4:33,606 --> 0:4:36,643
partly because of
the very thick jungle there,


66
0:4:36,643 --> 0:4:41,147
tigers as well as malaria.


67
0:4:41,147 --> 0:4:43,449
It took a breakthrough discovery to unlock


68
0:4:43,449 --> 0:4:48,521
the story of the Buddha's origins.


69
0:4:48,521 --> 0:4:54,894
In a remote village across the border
in Nepal a pillar was discovered.


70
0:4:54,894 --> 0:4:59,65
A British expedition was sent out
to decipher its inscription.


71
0:4:59,65 --> 0:5:1,34
The script is the early Brami script


72
0:5:1,34 --> 0:5:4,737
and the language is
a local vernacular language


73
0:5:4,737 --> 0:5:9,75
of Northern India
and indeed the inscription itself depicts


74
0:5:9,75 --> 0:5:17,417
that this is where the Buddha,
the enlightened one was born.


75
0:5:17,417 --> 0:5:20,486
This was the first piece of
evidence to suggest that the Buddha


76
0:5:20,486 --> 0:5:25,458
was not just a legendary figure
- he actually existed.


77
0:5:25,458 --> 0:5:29,796
Ancient Buddhist texts
had named the Buddha's birthplace as Lumbini


78
0:5:29,796 --> 0:5:35,301
and now the archaeologists
had it located on the map.


79
0:5:35,301 --> 0:5:38,4
Now they tried to find
the Buddha's childhood home


80
0:5:38,4 --> 0:5:43,42
- an ancient city named in the texts as
- Kapilavastu.


81
0:5:43,42 --> 0:5:46,179
It was apparent that
it was located to the west


82
0:5:46,179 --> 0:5:50,249
perhaps 10 or 15 kilometers
to the west of Lumbini


83
0:5:50,249 --> 0:5:54,12
and that is where the search
began to intensify.


84
0:5:54,12 --> 0:5:56,756
Expeditions uncovered two possible sites


85
0:5:56,756 --> 0:6:2,362
for Kapilavastu
- one in India the other in Nepal.


86
0:6:2,362 --> 0:6:6,999
For a hundred years archaeologists
have argued over them.


87
0:6:6,999 --> 0:6:9,635
New research by Dr Coningham
and his team


88
0:6:9,635 --> 0:6:15,174
suggests the ancient city lay
at modern day Tilaurakot - in Nepal.


89
0:6:15,174 --> 0:6:19,579
It's an extremely exciting site
because it is so well preserved,


90
0:6:19,579 --> 0:6:23,182
we conducted that a series of
geo physical surveys


91
0:6:23,182 --> 0:6:29,188
and we then identified a series of roads
laid out and it became a clear


92
0:6:29,188 --> 0:6:37,29
that the entire city in its final phrase
had been laid out on a girded pattern.


93
0:6:37,29 --> 0:6:39,732
At its centre lay a palace.


94
0:6:39,732 --> 0:6:46,472
It is here that the Buddha's story begins.


95
0:6:46,472 --> 0:6:48,674
Two and a half thousand years ago


96
0:6:48,674 --> 0:6:53,479
Northern India was divided up
into Kingdoms and republics.


97
0:6:53,479 --> 0:6:55,715
The Buddha's father - Sudhodana


98
0:6:55,715 --> 0:6:59,919
- was the elected chieftain
of the Shakya tribe.


99
0:6:59,919 --> 0:7:5,258
He ruled his kingdom from his palace
near the foothills of the Himalayas.


100
0:7:5,258 --> 0:7:8,728
His queen was called Maya.


101
0:7:8,728 --> 0:7:10,496
Legend tells that on the night


102
0:7:10,496 --> 0:7:14,3
of the full moon
she had an extraordinary dream.


103
0:7:14,3 --> 0:7:16,235
It told that a special Being known


104
0:7:16,235 --> 0:7:21,874
as the Buddha
was about to be born again on earth.


105
0:7:21,874 --> 0:7:25,144
The legend goes on
that Four Guardian deities of the world


106
0:7:25,144 --> 0:7:29,849
carried Queen Maya up to
the Himalaya mountains in her bed.


107
0:7:29,849 --> 0:7:34,954
They anointed her with divine perfumes
and decked her with heavenly flowers.


108
0:7:34,954 --> 0:7:38,291
A white elephant with
six tusks descended from heaven,


109
0:7:38,291 --> 0:7:42,795
carrying a lotus flower in its trunk,
and entered her womb.


110
0:7:42,795 --> 0:7:47,266
The Buddha would be born of Maya.


111
0:7:47,266 --> 0:7:50,837
If one looks at this story of
the Buddhist conception and compares it


112
0:7:50,837 --> 0:7:56,642
to say the conception story of Jesus,
where you have angels appearing.


113
0:7:56,642 --> 0:8:4,383
I suppose a similar basic idea is there.
That the forces which are beyond


114
0:8:4,383 --> 0:8:7,253
are signaling that
something great is happening.


115
0:8:7,253 --> 0:8:14,26
Its said that the Buddha chose the time
and the place that he would be reborn.


116
0:8:14,26 --> 0:8:18,998
The baby boy was named Siddhartha
- meaning 'every wish fulfilled'.


117
0:8:18,998 --> 0:8:23,402
But his mother fell ill after giving birth
and died a few days later.


118
0:8:23,402 --> 0:8:27,6
Siddharta was brought up by his aunt.


119
0:8:27,6 --> 0:8:29,141
The family summoned Brahmin priests


120
0:8:29,141 --> 0:8:34,113
and then a trusted palace soothsayer
to predict the young prince's future


121
0:8:34,113 --> 0:8:35,47
We're told that he noticed


122
0:8:35,47 --> 0:8:39,685
the auspicious signs of a great
being upon Siddhartha's body,


123
0:8:39,685 --> 0:8:43,789
including the mark of
a wheel upon his feet.


124
0:8:43,789 --> 0:8:46,425
It's said that the Buddha was born


125
0:8:46,425 --> 0:8:51,964
with certain marks on his body
the so called 32 marks of a great person.


126
0:8:51,964 --> 0:8:55,34
They are seen as appearing on
the body of two kinds of people.


127
0:8:55,34 --> 0:8:59,906
One who will become the Buddha
and one who will become a world Emperor.


128
0:8:59,906 --> 0:9:2,8
His father was quite keen on the idea


129
0:9:2,8 --> 0:9:4,944
that his son would become
a great political leader.


130
0:9:4,944 --> 0:9:8,648
So this is why it is said that
he cosseted his son,


131
0:9:8,648 --> 0:9:19,492
to prevent him seeing things which
might send him in a religious direction.


132
0:9:19,492 --> 0:9:25,131
Everyone knew the signs meant Siddharta
was exceptional, especially the King.


133
0:9:25,131 --> 0:9:26,232
But as he watched his


134
0:9:26,232 --> 0:9:30,636
inquisitive young son growing up
he worried about these predictions


135
0:9:30,636 --> 0:9:34,807
- that one day his son would abandon
the palace and become the spiritual leader


136
0:9:34,807 --> 0:9:44,383
rather than stay to become
chief of the Shakyas.


137
0:9:44,383 --> 0:9:48,554
As Siddhartha grew older his father
was delighted to see the boy's exceptional


138
0:9:48,554 --> 0:9:54,393
ability at the princely sports of fencing,
wrestling and archery.


139
0:9:54,393 --> 0:9:59,865
But he also noticed that Siddharta
was a deeply thoughtful and curious child.


140
0:9:59,865 --> 0:10:2,568
He appeared to be more interested in
trying to understand


141
0:10:2,568 --> 0:10:7,44
the nature of the world around him
than in military pursuits.


142
0:10:7,44 --> 0:10:10,443
For the King these were
the most important skills


143
0:10:10,443 --> 0:10:15,748
young Siddharta should learn
if he was to become a leader of men.


144
0:10:15,748 --> 0:10:17,416
Siddhartha was expected to become


145
0:10:17,416 --> 0:10:20,853
the future King
and defender of Kapilavasthu


146
0:10:20,853 --> 0:10:25,925
- one of the very first cities
in Northern India.


147
0:10:25,925 --> 0:10:30,262
The Palace where Siddhartha grew up
has long since crumbled away.


148
0:10:30,262 --> 0:10:31,797
Its mud and wood construction


149
0:10:31,797 --> 0:10:35,34
have left nothing
for archaeologists to examine.


150
0:10:35,34 --> 0:10:39,772
But more durable materials have recently
been discovered at Tilaurakot.


151
0:10:39,772 --> 0:10:43,476
We cut a trench 3 meters by 3 meters
and eventually


152
0:10:43,476 --> 0:10:45,711
We had a very clear sequence at the site


153
0:10:45,711 --> 0:10:51,384
and then we began to be somewhat surprised
by identifying a material known as


154
0:10:51,384 --> 0:10:57,223
painted greyware which is basically
a flat bowl with black paint.


155
0:10:57,223 --> 0:11:0,393
This tiny fragment has huge significance.


156
0:11:0,393 --> 0:11:4,263
Dr Coningham believes it was
made in the 5th Century BC


157
0:11:4,263 --> 0:11:8,67
- at the time Siddhartha was
growing up in the palace.


158
0:11:8,67 --> 0:11:13,606
What we have is a centre of small industry
- We are probably dealing with a settlement


159
0:11:13,606 --> 0:11:16,976
that we would even hesitate
to call a city today


160
0:11:16,976 --> 0:11:21,947
- centered around a large
courtyard belonging to the ruler.


161
0:11:21,947 --> 0:11:30,256
And the majority of the population living
in the agrarian hinterland.


162
0:11:30,256 --> 0:11:31,991
It was this hinterland,


163
0:11:31,991 --> 0:11:36,629
lying beyond the city walls
that fascinated Siddhartha.


164
0:11:36,629 --> 0:11:37,797
So when at the age of nine


165
0:11:37,797 --> 0:11:41,6
his father allowed him out
to celebrate the annual ploughing festival


166
0:11:41,6 --> 0:11:45,237
he eagerly participated.


167
0:11:45,237 --> 0:11:47,106
His first glimpse of reality beyond


168
0:11:47,106 --> 0:11:51,977
the palace walls would open a door
for Siddharta to a new vision of the world


169
0:11:51,977 --> 0:12:0,252
and would become
the turning point of his life.


170
0:12:0,252 --> 0:12:3,489
The story recalls that
he watched a farmer ploughing.


171
0:12:3,489 --> 0:12:8,561
He saw the toil and effort, struggle and
repetition of this back-breaking work,


172
0:12:8,561 --> 0:12:16,235
something he'd never seen in the palace.


173
0:12:16,235 --> 0:12:20,372
He managed to slip away from
the festivities and be alone.


174
0:12:20,372 --> 0:12:25,77
This first experience of real life
had a profound effect upon him.


175
0:12:25,77 --> 0:12:28,38
To everyone else this was a celebration


176
0:12:28,38 --> 0:12:36,822
- but to Siddhartha it symbolized
something quite different.


177
0:12:36,822 --> 0:12:42,27
He felt his mind leading him
into a contemplative state.


178
0:12:42,27 --> 0:12:43,796
He watched the plough as it cut


179
0:12:43,796 --> 0:12:49,702
and parted the ground and noticed a bird
eating a freshly unearthed worm.


180
0:12:49,702 --> 0:12:54,807
He asked himself why living beings
have to suffer in this way.


181
0:12:54,807 --> 0:12:59,979
If the farmer had not been ploughing
the bird would not have eaten the worm.


182
0:12:59,979 --> 0:13:5,651
He realized that everything was connected
and that all actions had consequences.


183
0:13:5,651 --> 0:13:7,653
This simple observation would become


184
0:13:7,653 --> 0:13:12,558
one of the corner stones of his teachings
- known as karma.


185
0:13:12,558 --> 0:13:16,362
As Siddharta's mind focused
on these profound thoughts he slipped


186
0:13:16,362 --> 0:13:20,99
into a trance or jana
- a mental state which would become


187
0:13:20,99 --> 0:13:23,836
his first step
on the road to enlightenment.


188
0:13:23,836 --> 0:13:25,204
He was sat under a tree


189
0:13:25,204 --> 0:13:29,842
and he was just focusing on
the plough going through the earth.


190
0:13:29,842 --> 0:13:33,112
And its said while doing that
he fairly Naturally went into


191
0:13:33,112 --> 0:13:38,15
a meditative state called a first Jana.
Which was very very joyful and happy.


192
0:13:38,15 --> 0:13:42,87
And which he later uses
as part of his spiritual path.


193
0:13:42,87 --> 0:13:43,756
The connection to Buddhist meditation


194
0:13:43,756 --> 0:13:47,827
is the focusing on something
which has a calming centering effect.


195
0:13:47,827 --> 0:13:49,762
Possibly also the idea of compassion


196
0:13:49,762 --> 0:13:56,202
for the worms being killed as
the plough went through the earth.


197
0:13:56,202 --> 0:14:2,74
So I suppose one would see this as
just part of his rather special nature.


198
0:14:2,74 --> 0:14:6,345
The young prince's behavior
deeply unsettled the King.


199
0:14:6,345 --> 0:14:9,548
Brahmanism
- the religious tradition of the time


200
0:14:9,548 --> 0:14:14,887
- insisted that sons should follow
in the footsteps of their fathers.


201
0:14:14,887 --> 0:14:18,624
One of the things that I think
makes this narrative so powerful is,


202
0:14:18,624 --> 0:14:25,164
again we can imagine
this scene of his father


203
0:14:25,164 --> 0:14:28,267
trying to protect his son
encountering any suffering.


204
0:14:28,267 --> 0:14:32,738
Now the reason for doing this is
that there has been a prophesy that/


205
0:14:32,738 --> 0:14:34,94
he'll either become a universal monarch


206
0:14:34,94 --> 0:14:39,511
or he'll become a renunciant
who will gain enlightenment.


207
0:14:39,511 --> 0:14:46,719
His father of course wants him to become
a king to follow in his footsteps.


208
0:14:46,719 --> 0:14:48,12
As Siddhartha grew up


209
0:14:48,12 --> 0:14:52,458
his father did all he could to tempt him
to stay inside the palace.


210
0:14:52,458 --> 0:15:7,72
He tried to create a perfect
and seductive world for him to live in.


211
0:15:7,72 --> 0:15:11,243
As was Customary for a prince,
Siddhartha was offered beautiful maidens


212
0:15:11,243 --> 0:15:29,295
to entertain him with music and
to pleasure him with their physical beauty.


213
0:15:29,295 --> 0:15:31,73
When Siddhartha reached the age of sixteen


214
0:15:31,73 --> 0:15:38,27
the King even found him a beautiful bride
- Princess Yasodhara.


215
0:15:38,27 --> 0:15:40,606
Siddharta had to compete for her hand


216
0:15:40,606 --> 0:15:46,845
and the King was delighted how skillfully
his son fought off the competition.


217
0:15:46,845 --> 0:15:48,781
The King began to convince himself


218
0:15:48,781 --> 0:15:53,118
that palace life was beginning
to suit his son at last.


219
0:15:53,118 --> 0:15:55,54
But this was wishful thinking


220
0:15:55,54 --> 0:16:0,96
and Siddhartha pestered his father
to allow him out of the palace.


221
0:16:0,96 --> 0:16:3,629
Unable to refuse
his son's wishes any longer,


222
0:16:3,629 --> 0:16:5,13
the King desperately set about


223
0:16:5,13 --> 0:16:12,771
clearing every eyesore
from the surrounds of the palace.


224
0:16:12,771 --> 0:16:17,343
Like a Hollywood film set, the sick,
the poor and the old were all deleted


225
0:16:17,343 --> 0:16:23,315
from the fantasy
presented to the young prince.


226
0:16:23,315 --> 0:16:25,117
Despite his father's efforts,


227
0:16:25,117 --> 0:16:32,491
Siddhartha's first taste of the
outside world would reveal stark realities.


228
0:16:32,491 --> 0:16:35,594
With the naivety of a child
he set out with Chana,


229
0:16:35,594 --> 0:16:42,434
his charioteer, as his guide.


230
0:16:42,434 --> 0:16:46,672
The prince would make four journeys
and see four signs


231
0:16:46,672 --> 0:16:50,376
- as predicted
by the palace fortune teller.


232
0:16:50,376 --> 0:16:54,646
Early Buddhist texts place great importance
on this point in the story


233
0:16:54,646 --> 0:16:57,216
as each journey would reveal to Siddhartha


234
0:16:57,216 --> 0:17:3,655
an aspect of life which had been
deliberately hidden from him.


235
0:17:3,655 --> 0:17:7,192
On his first trip Siddhartha
went out into the country,


236
0:17:7,192 --> 0:17:10,829
away from his father's influence.


237
0:17:10,829 --> 0:17:15,868
He noticed an old man painfully making
his way through a village.


238
0:17:15,868 --> 0:17:18,37
He asked Chana what was wrong with the man


239
0:17:18,37 --> 0:17:24,576
and Chana explained
the process of ageing to him.


240
0:17:24,576 --> 0:17:25,611
Siddhartha was alarmed


241
0:17:25,611 --> 0:17:34,153
when he learnt that ageing is inescapable
and happens to us all.


242
0:17:34,153 --> 0:17:35,22
For Siddhartha,


243
0:17:35,22 --> 0:17:39,525
reality was beginning to unveil
a cruel picture of the world.


244
0:17:39,525 --> 0:17:48,634
- Where misfortune and suffering appeared
to dominate every aspect of life.


245
0:17:48,634 --> 0:17:50,502
The second sign was soon to follow


246
0:17:50,502 --> 0:17:57,476
when Siddhartha noticed a sick man,
his features twisted with disease.


247
0:17:57,476 --> 0:18:1,713
He asked Chana if anyone could become sick
and again he was shocked


248
0:18:1,713 --> 0:18:8,52
when he learnt the brutal truth
that we all can.


249
0:18:8,52 --> 0:18:12,658
The protective wall of fantasy around him
was beginning to crumble.


250
0:18:12,658 --> 0:18:19,765
And the further the young Prince ventured
the more of life's horrors confronted him.


251
0:18:19,765 --> 0:18:22,434
Now he saw a corpse, bound in linen,


252
0:18:22,434 --> 0:18:26,371
being carried to the funeral pyre
- and the story records that Siddhartha


253
0:18:26,371 --> 0:18:30,209
is appalled to discover
not only that all men are mortal,


254
0:18:30,209 --> 0:18:34,78
but also that it was a Brahmin belief
that after death we are all reborn


255
0:18:34,78 --> 0:18:41,42
- to suffer and die time and time again.


256
0:18:41,42 --> 0:18:42,855
There seemed no end


257
0:18:42,855 --> 0:18:48,627
and no solution to life's miserable
and inevitable cycle.


258
0:18:48,627 --> 0:18:54,133
The Buddha's life is an allegory
because the most important point in it is


259
0:18:54,133 --> 0:18:59,104
that here is a young man
who is brought up with every luxury


260
0:18:59,104 --> 0:19:3,108
and he realizes that isn't enough
because he has a shock.


261
0:19:3,108 --> 0:19:9,882
He has a shock because for the first time
he encounters old age,


262
0:19:9,882 --> 0:19:13,785
disease and death.


263
0:19:13,785 --> 0:19:18,657
It's not plausible to think that
growing up as an intelligent youth


264
0:19:18,657 --> 0:19:23,162
he wouldn't have known anything about it.
The point is rather to


265
0:19:23,162 --> 0:19:27,799
convey the tremendous impact that
coming face to face with


266
0:19:27,799 --> 0:19:33,572
these fundamental facts of human existence,
has and must have upon us,


267
0:19:33,572 --> 0:19:40,646
and that it's urgent
that we do something about it.


268
0:19:40,646 --> 0:19:45,384
But it was the fourth sign that would
definitively point to Siddharta's future


269
0:19:45,384 --> 0:19:51,223
- a man wearing a simple robe
with a begging bowl before him.


270
0:19:51,223 --> 0:19:53,959
Why should anyone want to give up
the pleasures of the world


271
0:19:53,959 --> 0:19:57,763
to wander the countryside, begging?
Asked the prince.


272
0:19:57,763 --> 0:20:3,35
Chana explained that the man had renounced
such pleasures in order to confront reality


273
0:20:3,35 --> 0:20:9,541
and seek answers to this painful existence.


274
0:20:9,541 --> 0:20:15,214
The account of the four signs
I see as quite an effective story way


275
0:20:15,214 --> 0:20:20,152
of putting certain existential realizations
we all know we are going to get old


276
0:20:20,152 --> 0:20:22,888
we all know we are going to get sick
we all know we are going to die


277
0:20:22,888 --> 0:20:26,358
in our heads but its very different
to sit down on day


278
0:20:26,358 --> 0:20:31,597
and realize here no is not just
other people who get old sick and die


279
0:20:31,597 --> 0:20:36,602
its I'm going to get old
I'm going to get sick and I'm going to die


280
0:20:36,602 --> 0:20:40,339
and I think the story accounts
are trying to portray


281
0:20:40,339 --> 0:20:45,277
that moment of existential realization
where you see it for the first time


282
0:20:45,277 --> 0:20:49,414
you are going to die
and you know it and you taste it.


283
0:20:49,414 --> 0:20:53,185
When Siddartha returned to the palace
after this fourth journey


284
0:20:53,185 --> 0:21:1,26
his mind was reeling
with his new understanding of the world.


285
0:21:1,26 --> 0:21:5,764
The fruits and flowers around him
would rot and wither away.


286
0:21:5,764 --> 0:21:11,36
Even the walls of the palace
would one day crumble.


287
0:21:11,36 --> 0:21:14,273
His wife had just given
birth to a beautiful child.


288
0:21:14,273 --> 0:21:16,975
But they would both one day grow old,


289
0:21:16,975 --> 0:21:22,414
become ill and die. It was inevitable.


290
0:21:22,414 --> 0:21:28,453
He had learnt the meaning of impermanence
and saw it in everything around him.


291
0:21:28,453 --> 0:21:30,756
Siddharta knew he had to leave his family


292
0:21:30,756 --> 0:21:34,426
to seek answers to the questions
that tormented him,


293
0:21:34,426 --> 0:21:38,33
even though this meant
abandoning his wife and son.


294
0:21:38,33 --> 0:21:41,967
Against the tradition of his family
and the Brahmin religion,


295
0:21:41,967 --> 0:21:49,708
Siddhartha left home to find
his own answers to life's suffering.


296
0:21:49,708 --> 0:21:51,209
One story recalls


297
0:21:51,209 --> 0:21:54,179
how a hypnotic mist sent
the guards to sleep


298
0:21:54,179 --> 0:22:12,3
allowing him to escape with Chana,
through the Eastern Gate of the palace.


299
0:22:12,3 --> 0:22:16,702
It is said that beside the river Anoma,
he removed his jewellery,


300
0:22:16,702 --> 0:22:21,173
exchanged his robes for rags
and cut off his long hair.


301
0:22:21,173 --> 0:22:28,113
He asked Chana to carry them
back to the palace.


302
0:22:28,113 --> 0:22:30,949
Siddhartha was alone for the first time.


303
0:22:30,949 --> 0:22:34,286
He had at last escaped
the false world of palace life


304
0:22:34,286 --> 0:22:38,59
where suffering had been
swept out of sight.


305
0:22:38,59 --> 0:22:41,693
Now he needed to come
face to face with reality,


306
0:22:41,693 --> 0:22:48,9
if he was ever to find a solution
to the pain of existence.


307
0:22:48,9 --> 0:22:51,703
Siddhartha was confronted
by suffering on a scale


308
0:22:51,703 --> 0:22:58,477
he'd never seen before
when he arrived in the cities.


309
0:22:58,477 --> 0:23:0,379
And within those cities people
were being thrown together,


310
0:23:0,379 --> 0:23:4,516
at times there was perhaps
an increase in disease and suffering.


311
0:23:4,516 --> 0:23:7,319
Some people have seen
this as a particular trigger


312
0:23:7,319 --> 0:23:10,622
for the Buddha's emphasis on suffering.


313
0:23:10,622 --> 0:23:22,234
It accentuated a universal problems
that any human being in any society faces.


314
0:23:22,234 --> 0:23:23,769
Siddhartha realized that


315
0:23:23,769 --> 0:23:27,5
if he was to find an answer
to the suffering surrounding him,


316
0:23:27,5 --> 0:23:28,373
he would have to challenge


317
0:23:28,373 --> 0:23:32,377
the Brahmin religion under
which everyone lived.


318
0:23:32,377 --> 0:23:38,85
What the Brahmins had was sacred knowledge
this sacred knowledge


319
0:23:38,85 --> 0:23:42,421
centered on knowing certain texts
called the Vedas


320
0:23:42,421 --> 0:23:46,758
the word Veda itself simply means knowledge
and the implication is that


321
0:23:46,758 --> 0:23:51,163
that was the only knowledge
which was really worth having.


322
0:23:51,163 --> 0:23:53,198
With their sacred knowledge,


323
0:23:53,198 --> 0:23:56,701
Brahmin priests
oversaw every stage of life,


324
0:23:56,701 --> 0:24:2,14
from birth to death.


325
0:24:2,14 --> 0:24:3,975
Their blessing was essential


326
0:24:3,975 --> 0:24:8,146
but their knowledge could only be
handed down to their sons.


327
0:24:8,146 --> 0:24:11,349
The position of
Brahmin families remained assured


328
0:24:11,349 --> 0:24:15,754
- until a new wave of thinkers
began to challenge this.


329
0:24:15,754 --> 0:24:18,123
It was a time when Brahamism,


330
0:24:18,123 --> 0:24:23,662
early form of Hinduism
was being questioned,


331
0:24:23,662 --> 0:24:27,466
it was a little bit like
the time of the ancient philosophers


332
0:24:27,466 --> 0:24:31,47
such as Plato
and Socrates in Ancient Greece.


333
0:24:31,47 --> 0:24:34,773
People debating arguing with people and


334
0:24:34,773 --> 0:24:38,243
the Buddha tried to cut a way through that.


335
0:24:38,243 --> 0:24:45,45
He described the context as a welter
of views a jungle of views.


336
0:24:45,45 --> 0:24:48,887
As Siddhartha explored
this jungle he realized that


337
0:24:48,887 --> 0:24:53,124
the solution to life's suffering
needed to be available to everyone,


338
0:24:53,124 --> 0:24:57,462
rather than an exclusive few
- like the Brahmin tradition.


339
0:24:57,462 --> 0:25:3,902
The Buddha disagreed with the Brahmins
and he said one does not become a Brahmin


340
0:25:3,902 --> 0:25:6,705
by birth one becomes a Brahmin


341
0:25:6,705 --> 0:25:10,8
by living well one
does not become an outcast


342
0:25:10,8 --> 0:25:14,813
by birth one becomes an outcast
by living badly.


343
0:25:14,813 --> 0:25:21,286
Now that's a wonderful and important thought
its like saying in our society


344
0:25:21,286 --> 0:25:25,49
a true gentleman is not one
who is born into a particular family


345
0:25:25,49 --> 0:25:30,962
but one who behaves properly.


346
0:25:30,962 --> 0:25:35,901
Siddhartha traveled further
on his search into Northern India.


347
0:25:35,901 --> 0:25:38,603
He was looking
for an alternative way of life


348
0:25:38,603 --> 0:25:45,977
that attempted to overcome
the suffering he'd seen around him.


349
0:25:45,977 --> 0:25:49,314
He was interested
in all the new philosophies


350
0:25:49,314 --> 0:25:54,486
but he wanted to go further
- to reach deeper into his mind.


351
0:25:54,486 --> 0:25:57,989
He now decided to focus on
the technique of meditation


352
0:25:57,989 --> 0:26:1,593
and sought out
the leading gurus of the day.


353
0:26:1,593 --> 0:26:6,798
There been broadly speaking two kinds
of meditation in ancient India.


354
0:26:6,798 --> 0:26:10,802
Which consisted in putting yourself
under various kinds of pressure


355
0:26:10,802 --> 0:26:15,807
by controlling your breathing
or sometimes fasting


356
0:26:15,807 --> 0:26:19,678
or undergoing other forms of discomfort


357
0:26:19,678 --> 0:26:26,518
and the aim is really to obtain what
we call altered states of consciousness.


358
0:26:26,518 --> 0:26:32,624
So they would think that they had climbed
to very high plains in the universe.


359
0:26:32,624 --> 0:26:34,593
They're not taking this literally,


360
0:26:34,593 --> 0:26:37,696
its not that they think that
they go five thousand feet up in the air,


361
0:26:37,696 --> 0:26:41,766
so to speak but they think that
there are certain planes which become more


362
0:26:41,766 --> 0:26:47,639
and more abstract such things
as the plane of infinity of space


363
0:26:47,639 --> 0:26:50,809
and that's followed by the plane of
infinite consciousness as you got


364
0:26:50,809 --> 0:26:53,545
and then the plane of infinite nothingness,


365
0:26:53,545 --> 0:26:54,746
these were the sorts of things


366
0:26:54,746 --> 0:26:58,383
the Buddha definitely must have learnt
from his teachers.


367
0:26:58,383 --> 0:26:59,751
It is said that Siddhartha,


368
0:26:59,751 --> 0:27:4,589
so excelled at mediating that
he attracted a group of five followers


369
0:27:4,589 --> 0:27:9,194
and his teachers asked him to stay on
and take over their schools.


370
0:27:9,194 --> 0:27:11,896
But Siddhartha decided that
this practice alone was not


371
0:27:11,896 --> 0:27:17,869
the answer to the problem of suffering
and rebirth or reincarnation.


372
0:27:17,869 --> 0:27:22,741
He set out to explore other techniques
- this time focusing on his body.


373
0:27:22,741 --> 0:27:28,79
So he then goes to try another method
which is harsh asceticism.


374
0:27:28,79 --> 0:27:32,751
This involved things like fasting,
not washing,


375
0:27:32,751 --> 0:27:36,87
meditations where you hold your breath
for a very long time


376
0:27:36,87 --> 0:27:46,998
and its very forceful willful way.


377
0:27:46,998 --> 0:27:50,502
Ascetics may starve
and even mutilate themselves.


378
0:27:50,502 --> 0:27:57,942
For them the physical body
is a barrier to spiritual liberation.


379
0:27:57,942 --> 0:28:0,178
By shedding their attachment to the body


380
0:28:0,178 --> 0:28:8,319
they will cleanse the mind
and liberate the soul.


381
0:28:8,319 --> 0:28:12,123
Siddhartha tried to
achieve this state of liberation.


382
0:28:12,123 --> 0:28:17,796
He fasted for so long
his life hung by a thread.


383
0:28:17,796 --> 0:28:22,133
'All my limbs became like
the knotted joints of withered creepers,


384
0:28:22,133 --> 0:28:24,836
my buttocks like a bullocks hoof,


385
0:28:24,836 --> 0:28:28,506
my protruding backbone
like a string of balls,


386
0:28:28,506 --> 0:28:33,578
my gaunt ribs like the crazy rafters
of a tumbledown shed.


387
0:28:33,578 --> 0:28:36,147
My eyes lay deep in their sockets,


388
0:28:36,147 --> 0:28:39,984
their pupils sparkling
like water in a deep well.


389
0:28:39,984 --> 0:28:44,355
As an unripe gourd shrivels
and shrinks in the hot wind,


390
0:28:44,355 --> 0:28:53,31
so became my scalp.


391
0:28:53,31 --> 0:28:56,968
Just as Siddhartha
was about to die of starvation a young girl


392
0:28:56,968 --> 0:29:2,14
saved his life by giving him
a bowl of rice and milk.


393
0:29:2,14 --> 0:29:5,71
He now realized that
if he starved himself again


394
0:29:5,71 --> 0:29:11,49
he would simply die
having achieved nothing.


395
0:29:11,49 --> 0:29:13,885
And the story says that
he is living on one grain of rice a day.


396
0:29:13,885 --> 0:29:16,788
He's practically starved himself to death


397
0:29:16,788 --> 0:29:25,43
and realizes that disciplining the body
through extreme self renunciation,


398
0:29:25,43 --> 0:29:34,405
aestheticism inflicting pain upon the body
that doesn't solve the problem.


399
0:29:34,405 --> 0:29:36,374
When his five followers saw Siddhartha


400
0:29:36,374 --> 0:29:40,111
had given up his fast
they lost faith in him.


401
0:29:40,111 --> 0:29:42,8
They no longer believed he had the strength


402
0:29:42,8 --> 0:29:46,918
to live up to his spiritual convictions
and abandoned him.


403
0:29:46,918 --> 0:29:49,22
He feels he tried what's on offer,


404
0:29:49,22 --> 0:29:51,556
they haven't worked,


405
0:29:51,556 --> 0:29:54,192
and its at this stage
that he remembers meditation


406
0:29:54,192 --> 0:29:58,963
that he went into spontaneously
in his teens/ and he thinks mm,


407
0:29:58,963 --> 0:30:4,569
maybe that is a way through to awakening
because its not taken up the desires


408
0:30:4,569 --> 0:30:9,307
of the body
but it is very joyful and happy.


409
0:30:9,307 --> 0:30:14,45
By chance Siddharta came across
a musician tuning his sitar.


410
0:30:14,45 --> 0:30:17,649
When the string was too slack
it would not play.


411
0:30:17,649 --> 0:30:20,685
When it was too tight it snapped.


412
0:30:20,685 --> 0:30:25,957
Somewhere in the middle lay
tuneful harmony.


413
0:30:25,957 --> 0:30:27,258
Siddhartha realized that


414
0:30:27,258 --> 0:30:32,197
this simple observation signified
something of great importance.


415
0:30:32,197 --> 0:30:36,534
It was the middle way that would lead him
to the state of mind he was looking for


416
0:30:36,534 --> 0:30:41,706
- to a state of tuneful harmony
- enlightenment.


417
0:30:41,706 --> 0:30:44,876
But how could he achieve it?


418
0:30:44,876 --> 0:30:49,113
And the way that Buddha eventually uses
is what one could call mindfulness


419
0:30:49,113 --> 0:30:50,815
or awareness of the body,


420
0:30:50,815 --> 0:30:54,152
which neither ignores it nor tries
to forcefully master it,


421
0:30:54,152 --> 0:31:0,24
but it's a kind of middle way.


422
0:31:0,24 --> 0:31:3,962
The middle way led Siddhartha
through the countryside.


423
0:31:3,962 --> 0:31:9,367
He had been traveling for six years,
He had experienced pain and suffering


424
0:31:9,367 --> 0:31:12,337
and had stretched
the boundaries of his mind.


425
0:31:12,337 --> 0:31:17,308
But he'd still not found the inner peace
and harmony he was searching for.


426
0:31:17,308 --> 0:31:27,385
The state of absolute wisdom and
everlasting bliss known as Enlightenment.


427
0:31:27,385 --> 0:31:30,121
Siddhartha arrived at Bodh Gaya.


428
0:31:30,121 --> 0:31:35,426
Here his torment would end.


429
0:31:35,426 --> 0:31:51,876
He sat down beneath a tree and vowed not to
leave until he had reached ENLIGHTENMENT.


430
0:31:51,876 --> 0:31:55,613
'Flesh may decay, bones may fall apart,


431
0:31:55,613 --> 0:32:4,355
but I will never leave this place
until I find the way to enlightenment. '


432
0:32:4,355 --> 0:32:7,392
He's no longer giving himself a hard time,


433
0:32:7,392 --> 0:32:13,331
he's not stressing himself unbearably,
he's not undergoing anything painful,


434
0:32:13,331 --> 0:32:18,469
he thinks, well life is painful without
taking the trouble to make it more painful,


435
0:32:18,469 --> 0:32:26,945
but let me just calmly think things out,
think of how life works.


436
0:32:26,945 --> 0:32:34,786
He starts to focus the mind by attention
to the slow movement of the breath coming


437
0:32:34,786 --> 0:32:39,824
and going out a refined sensation
which exists in the body


438
0:32:39,824 --> 0:32:48,232
just around the nose in a way which
starts to lead to the mind quietening,


439
0:32:48,232 --> 0:33:43,621
stilling, settling, gathering, purifying.


440
0:33:43,621 --> 0:33:46,357
Siddhartha's mind was now so focused


441
0:33:46,357 --> 0:33:52,43
that he could successfully
enter the darkest reaches of his unconscious.


442
0:33:52,43 --> 0:33:56,667
It was now that he would face
his final and greatest torment.


443
0:33:56,667 --> 0:34:1,606
The demon Mara - the Lord of Ego
and illusion appeared before him.


444
0:34:1,606 --> 0:34:6,611
He could make any horror real
in Siddhartha's mind.


445
0:34:6,611 --> 0:34:9,247
It's very important to remember
that Mara this demon king


446
0:34:9,247 --> 0:34:14,18
is not like the Christian Satan
because he isn't a tempter


447
0:34:14,18 --> 0:34:17,388
and he isn't any kind of counterpart
to God,


448
0:34:17,388 --> 0:34:27,999
he is purely psychological forces
which we have within us,


449
0:34:27,999 --> 0:34:32,236
Mara unleashed an army of demons
to attack Siddhartha.


450
0:34:32,236 --> 0:34:40,978
They fired flaming arrows at him.


451
0:34:40,978 --> 0:34:44,916
But mid flight
Siddhartha turned them into lotus blossoms


452
0:34:44,916 --> 0:34:55,793
and they fell harmlessly around him.


453
0:34:55,793 --> 0:34:59,3
Having failed Mara
then tried to seduce Siddhartha


454
0:34:59,3 --> 0:35:7,538
with his tempting daughters.


455
0:35:7,538 --> 0:35:11,976
He's assailed by the demon king
who is the same time death


456
0:35:11,976 --> 0:35:16,681
and desire very Freudian
that in a way desire is death,


457
0:35:16,681 --> 0:35:21,986
death is desire and in fact the Demon king
offers him his three daughters


458
0:35:21,986 --> 0:35:29,594
who are both passion or lust and aversion
where it is equally bad


459
0:35:29,594 --> 0:35:33,3
if you shy away from this
and say it is disgusting


460
0:35:33,3 --> 0:35:36,267
you are also a slave to passion


461
0:35:36,267 --> 0:35:38,703
- and he can be completely calm
and indifferent


462
0:35:38,703 --> 0:35:46,144
and just gaze at them without
any feelings of attraction or repulsion.


463
0:35:46,144 --> 0:35:51,816
The faces of Mara's daughters
began to rot before Siddharta's eyes.


464
0:35:51,816 --> 0:35:57,221
The evil daughters
then disappeared into the earth.


465
0:35:57,221 --> 0:36:1,492
It is in fact
you could say the Buddha's very recognition


466
0:36:1,492 --> 0:36:5,229
that Mara is an aspect of himself


467
0:36:5,229 --> 0:36:10,434
the total recognition of that
is his enlightenment.


468
0:36:10,434 --> 0:36:14,38
The earth is said to have trembled
as he dispelled the devil.


469
0:36:14,38 --> 0:36:18,242
Siddhartha, now aged 35,
passed through four Janas


470
0:36:18,242 --> 0:36:19,577
to reach enlightenment


471
0:36:19,577 --> 0:36:25,683
and become the Buddha - or Awakened One.


472
0:36:25,683 --> 0:36:35,526
He then spent 7 days beneath the tree
in a meditative state of absolute bliss.


473
0:36:35,526 --> 0:36:40,998
This is seen as a state where the mind
is incredibly refined and sensitive,


474
0:36:40,998 --> 0:36:44,902
and an image might be of a lake,
which is totally still,


475
0:36:44,902 --> 0:36:49,4
which would register
even an insect on the surface.


476
0:36:49,4 --> 0:36:51,542
So this is seen as a state
where the mind is very,


477
0:36:51,542 --> 0:36:55,947
very powerful as
an instrument of knowledge, very sensitive.


478
0:36:55,947 --> 0:36:58,216
In this highly attuned state,


479
0:36:58,216 --> 0:36:59,984
the Buddha saw way to escape


480
0:36:59,984 --> 0:37:4,121
the inevitable cycle of old age sickness
and death.


481
0:37:4,121 --> 0:37:7,291
He realized that if we remove desire


482
0:37:7,291 --> 0:37:12,43
we can remove dissatisfaction
and suffering from our lives.


483
0:37:12,43 --> 0:37:15,6
A key cause of the painfulness


484
0:37:15,6 --> 0:37:20,204
and frustration of life
is craving kind of demanding desires.


485
0:37:20,204 --> 0:37:23,174
So There's a general mismatch


486
0:37:23,174 --> 0:37:27,912
between how you want things to be
and how they actually are.


487
0:37:27,912 --> 0:37:32,617
The insight the Buddha attained
beneath the tree was the birth of Buddhism


488
0:37:32,617 --> 0:37:38,389
- a religion followed today
by 400 million people.


489
0:37:38,389 --> 0:37:41,926
The Buddha summed up his wisdom
in four noble truths


490
0:37:41,926 --> 0:37:47,398
which are the foundation
of all Buddhist beliefs


491
0:37:47,398 --> 0:37:52,169
The first noble truth recognized
that there is suffering in life.


492
0:37:52,169 --> 0:37:57,308
The second diagnosed
the cause of that suffering - desire.


493
0:37:57,308 --> 0:37:59,777
In the third truth, like a doctor,


494
0:37:59,777 --> 0:38:3,281
the Buddha revealed
that there was a cure for desire.


495
0:38:3,281 --> 0:38:7,51
And in the fourth noble truth
he gave the prescription


496
0:38:7,51 --> 0:38:12,923
- how to cure the illness
and achieve Enlightenment or Nirvana.


497
0:38:12,923 --> 0:38:17,395
The ultimate aim was to reach
a state of mind completely free of craving,


498
0:38:17,395 --> 0:38:20,731
ignorance, greed, hatred and delusion,


499
0:38:20,731 --> 0:38:25,503
thereby free of all
the causes of future rebirth


500
0:38:25,503 --> 0:38:29,44
when an enlightened person dies
they're seen as going beyond rebirth


501
0:38:29,44 --> 0:38:33,778
to a state beyond if you like space
and time and not coming back


502
0:38:33,778 --> 0:38:39,984
so that is seen as a state of liberation.


503
0:38:39,984 --> 0:38:44,255
The Buddha would further teach
that morality, meditation and wisdom


504
0:38:44,255 --> 0:38:50,594
were the stepping stones to enlightenment.


505
0:38:50,594 --> 0:38:55,32
He would dedicate the rest of his life
helping others to follow this path


506
0:38:55,32 --> 0:38:57,835
- towards freedom from suffering.


507
0:38:57,835 --> 0:39:5,609
As his followers grew in number
he went on to set up a school or Sangha


508
0:39:5,609 --> 0:39:8,12
Today a temple stands beside a descendant


509
0:39:8,12 --> 0:39:15,386
of the very tree under
which the Buddha became enlightened.


510
0:39:15,386 --> 0:39:23,461
The monks here have become
a living library of the Buddha's teachings.


511
0:39:23,461 --> 0:39:27,264
Chanting his sacred words
beneath the Bodhi tree of Enlightenment


512
0:39:27,264 --> 0:39:33,104
is seen by Buddhists to give special power
to their practice.


513
0:39:33,104 --> 0:39:34,505
The chief monk is responsible


514
0:39:34,505 --> 0:39:37,708
for preserving this tradition
at the temple.


515
0:39:37,708 --> 0:39:42,88
The most important thing
is the practice of his teachings.


516
0:39:42,88 --> 0:39:48,452
Practice diligently, be ever mindful.


517
0:39:48,452 --> 0:39:55,226
So now I say I explain Buddhism
in two words,


518
0:39:55,226 --> 0:39:59,43
practice mindfulness.


519
0:39:59,43 --> 0:40:2,833
The path to enlightenment begins
with the focusing of the mind


520
0:40:2,833 --> 0:40:6,804
and following a number of commandments.


521
0:40:6,804 --> 0:40:11,208
Morality, meditation and wisdom.


522
0:40:11,208 --> 0:40:15,98
So not to kill, not to steal,


523
0:40:15,98 --> 0:40:19,95
not to have any sexual misconduct,


524
0:40:19,95 --> 0:40:31,996
not to tell a lie and not to have indulge
in intoxicating drinks or intoxicants.


525
0:40:31,996 --> 0:40:39,603
This was the way of life established by
the Buddha in the very first sangha.


526
0:40:39,603 --> 0:40:40,905
After eight years


527
0:40:40,905 --> 0:40:45,142
he went back to the palace
and the family he'd abandoned.


528
0:40:45,142 --> 0:40:46,911
We're told his father now forgave


529
0:40:46,911 --> 0:40:50,47
the Buddha for the deep hurt
he had caused.


530
0:40:50,47 --> 0:40:55,152
King Sudhodhana now realized the importance
of his son's quest.


531
0:40:55,152 --> 0:40:58,255
His stepmother even begged
to join his sangha


532
0:40:58,255 --> 0:41:1,792
and she went on to become
history's first nun.


533
0:41:1,792 --> 0:41:6,13
The Buddha is justified in the eyes
of all Buddhists of even leaving his wife


534
0:41:6,13 --> 0:41:13,137
and child to go on his solitary journey
to try and find what the solution


535
0:41:13,137 --> 0:41:16,674
to life's problems is
and how life should be lived


536
0:41:16,674 --> 0:41:23,881
and for him how life should be lived
is the question infinitely more important


537
0:41:23,881 --> 0:41:29,887
than having any possessions
or even the company of loved ones.


538
0:41:29,887 --> 0:41:36,293
The Buddha was to abandon his family again.
He set out to teach, for forty years


539
0:41:36,293 --> 0:41:41,565
- passing on to his followers the wisdom
he had attained beneath the bodi tree.


540
0:41:41,565 --> 0:41:48,138
But before he left he ordained
his son as a monk.


541
0:41:48,138 --> 0:41:52,61
The Buddha encouraged his followers
to live together in a monastery or Sangha


542
0:41:52,61 --> 0:41:57,147
- to help them focus
on the path to enlightenment.


543
0:41:57,147 --> 0:42:1,318
Some people become
a monk purely to meditate,


544
0:42:1,318 --> 0:42:9,493
purely to practice meditation,
purely to practice the life of a recluse.


545
0:42:9,493 --> 0:42:16,133
Some become a monk to work
for the propagation of the religion.


546
0:42:16,133 --> 0:42:17,635
Monks from all over the world


547
0:42:17,635 --> 0:42:22,873
come to live in monasteries established
around the temple of the Bodi Tree.


548
0:42:22,873 --> 0:42:29,28
Non-Monks or lay Buddhists,
come here too, to learn from them.


549
0:42:29,28 --> 0:42:34,451
Monks must be celibate
and give up every selfish desire.


550
0:42:34,451 --> 0:42:42,526
And that is the one part of the training
to get rid of self tendencies,


551
0:42:42,526 --> 0:42:44,862
tendencies to always think about yourself


552
0:42:44,862 --> 0:42:51,635
and put yourself fully in
the context of the community of the sanga


553
0:42:51,635 --> 0:42:56,106
Then when all the sacrifices
have been made the hard work begins


554
0:42:56,106 --> 0:43:0,911
- committing long chants
or mantras to memory.


555
0:43:0,911 --> 0:43:3,38
Mantras such as this have a purpose


556
0:43:3,38 --> 0:43:5,616
- they are designed
to test the monk's memory,


557
0:43:5,616 --> 0:43:11,422
concentration and commitment
to the Buddha's teachings.


558
0:43:11,422 --> 0:43:16,226
Over the centuries his message has evolved
into a number of different traditions,


559
0:43:16,226 --> 0:43:22,99
with their own interpretations
and monastic practices.


560
0:43:22,99 --> 0:43:23,934
But the Buddha taught that lay people


561
0:43:23,934 --> 0:43:29,74
can also follow the path to eternal bliss
and ultimate wisdom.


562
0:43:29,74 --> 0:43:32,776
Most westerners are not drawn to Buddhism
as a way of leaving society behind


563
0:43:32,776 --> 0:43:36,13
they're drawn to the practical
of meditation as a way of being


564
0:43:36,13 --> 0:43:39,316
more effective within society
and that's a way in which


565
0:43:39,316 --> 0:43:42,92
the message of Buddhism takes on
a very different caste


566
0:43:42,92 --> 0:43:47,124
because it becomes a form
of self improvement a way of dealing


567
0:43:47,124 --> 0:43:54,231
with the stresses of life a way
of clarifying your goals and objectives.


568
0:43:54,231 --> 0:43:59,837
Many westerners are especially attracted
to Buddhist meditation.


569
0:43:59,837 --> 0:44:5,42
I think all of us sometimes glimpse
that magic and mystery of the moment


570
0:44:5,42 --> 0:44:9,647
what meditation does
is to help us touch that more often,


571
0:44:9,647 --> 0:44:13,17
it helps us to be more calm
and controlled in our mind


572
0:44:13,17 --> 0:44:16,12
and we can create conditions
that allow us to come into


573
0:44:16,12 --> 0:44:23,727
a state of awareness of interdependence,
of impermanence, of nirvana.


574
0:44:23,727 --> 0:44:27,464
Some schools of Buddhism
believe the Buddha was superhuman


575
0:44:27,464 --> 0:44:32,169
a magical figure who consorted
with gods and performed miracles.


576
0:44:32,169 --> 0:44:33,437
Others that he was no more than


577
0:44:33,437 --> 0:44:39,643
a human being and they believe it is this
that adds power to his message.


578
0:44:39,643 --> 0:44:44,915
There is no doubt that the Buddha wished
to be remembered as a human being


579
0:44:44,915 --> 0:44:51,555
with human frailties not perhaps frailties
of the intellect or moral frailties


580
0:44:51,555 --> 0:44:53,624
but certainly physical frailties


581
0:44:53,624 --> 0:44:58,128
and the Buddha suffers from back pain
towards the end of his life


582
0:44:58,128 --> 0:45:3,901
he suffers from various physical complaints
and weaknesses.


583
0:45:3,901 --> 0:45:11,775
The Buddha would die at the age of eighty
from a common illness - food poisoning.


584
0:45:11,775 --> 0:45:12,71
It is said that before


585
0:45:12,71 --> 0:45:17,981
passing away he fell into a deep trance
on his journey from this world to Nirvana


586
0:45:17,981 --> 0:45:20,84
- a state of eternal bliss


587
0:45:20,84 --> 0:45:22,219
- free at last from rebirth,


588
0:45:22,219 --> 0:45:29,126
free at last from suffering and death.


589
0:45:29,126 --> 0:45:34,798
A council was assembled to record
for posterity the Buddha's teachings.


590
0:45:34,798 --> 0:45:41,905
These were learnt by heart and handed down
the centuries by generations of monks.


591
0:45:41,905 --> 0:45:43,907
The Buddha's body was cremated.


592
0:45:43,907 --> 0:45:47,978
And his remains were preserved.


593
0:45:47,978 --> 0:45:50,214
They were enshrined two hundred years later


594
0:45:50,214 --> 0:45:58,88
by India's first Emperor King Ashoka
who converted to Buddhism.


595
0:45:58,88 --> 0:46:0,924
He built vast monuments or stuppas


596
0:46:0,924 --> 0:46:5,329
and erected pillars to mark the key sites
of the Buddha's life.


597
0:46:5,329 --> 0:46:7,965
Asoka then becomes
an absolutely key figure,


598
0:46:7,965 --> 0:46:11,702
both in terms
of the actual spread of Buddhism


599
0:46:11,702 --> 0:46:13,37
but then as a model


600
0:46:13,37 --> 0:46:18,475
for future Buddhist leaders throughout Asia
they look back to Ashoka as


601
0:46:18,475 --> 0:46:24,681
the kind of ideal king
and supporter of Buddhism.


602
0:46:24,681 --> 0:46:26,784
So far as we know the Emperor Asoka


603
0:46:26,784 --> 0:46:30,487
who ruled over two thirds of modern India


604
0:46:30,487 --> 0:46:33,157
in the middle of the 3rd century BC,


605
0:46:33,157 --> 0:46:39,863
helped monks to send out missions
to countries bordering India,


606
0:46:39,863 --> 0:46:45,536
missionaries were sent up into Kashmir
to Nepal and certainly Sri Lanka.


607
0:46:45,536 --> 0:46:49,206
They converted the king,
the king give his patronize to Buddhism


608
0:46:49,206 --> 0:46:53,477
and Sri Lanka has therefore been
a Buddhist country from that day to this.


609
0:46:53,477 --> 0:46:56,947
And in country after country
we know over many centuries


610
0:46:56,947 --> 0:47:5,322
that this is the way
that Buddhism was successfully implanted.


611
0:47:5,322 --> 0:47:10,561
Ashoka's pillars outlived Buddhism in India
- they withstood Muslim invasions


612
0:47:10,561 --> 0:47:15,666
and survived to catch the attention
of the first colonial archaeologists.


613
0:47:15,666 --> 0:47:19,269
This gave a very significant impetus
to the revival of Buddhism


614
0:47:19,269 --> 0:47:22,673
- the desire to go back to the places
associated with the Buddha.


615
0:47:22,673 --> 0:47:27,678
Imagining Buddhism for people in the West
but these investigations also become


616
0:47:27,678 --> 0:47:33,55
the basest for a revival
within Buddhism in Asia.


617
0:47:33,55 --> 0:47:38,21
Today the sites associated
with the Budha's life attract tourists


618
0:47:38,21 --> 0:47:42,192
and pilgrims flock to Bodh Gaya
to follow in the Buddha's footsteps,


619
0:47:42,192 --> 0:47:44,661
hoping to find, as he did,


620
0:47:44,661 --> 0:47:50,267
eternal peace and happiness
and a cure for suffering and death.


621
0:47:50,267 --> 0:47:55,5
It's a great irony
that after the Buddha's death the person


622
0:47:55,5 --> 0:47:59,276
who preached of the uselessness of ritual
and also the uselessness


623
0:47:59,276 --> 0:48:3,38
of personality cult became
the object of ritual worship


624
0:48:3,38 --> 0:48:9,62
and as big a personality cult
as has ever existed in history.


625
0:48:9,62 --> 0:48:12,723
Buddhist temples have been
built in Bodh Gaya representing


626
0:48:12,723 --> 0:48:17,227
the different traditions
from around the world.


627
0:48:17,227 --> 0:48:22,432
Buddhism, in all its forms,
has come home, to the Bodi tree,


628
0:48:22,432 --> 0:48:29,473
to the place where once a prince reached
enlightenment and became the Buddha.


629
0:48:29,473 --> 0:48:39,16
The Buddha attained enlightenment on that
fleeting moment of a wink, this moment,


630
0:48:39,16 --> 0:48:51,561
fleeting moment is the time that takes
to realize that moment cannot be explained.


631
0:48:51,561 --> 0:48:56,5
That special moment gave birth
to the first world religion


632
0:48:56,5 --> 0:48:58,702
- A religion without a God


633
0:48:58,702 --> 0:49:14,437
where the path to Nirvana lies in the mind
of each and every one of us.
