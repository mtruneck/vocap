RYAN DUFFY: Hey, I'm Ryan
Duffy, and we're


3
0:0:9,36 --> 0:0:10,27
here in New York City.


4
0:0:10,27 --> 0:0:12,61
We actually just got
back to the States.


5
0:0:12,61 --> 0:0:15,9
We spent some time down in
Colombia, where we found out


6
0:0:15,9 --> 0:0:17,6
that some of the locals--


7
0:0:17,6 --> 0:0:18,31
they fuck donkeys.


8
0:0:18,31 --> 0:0:27,41



9
0:0:27,41 --> 0:0:29,575
We're on the Caribbean here
in Cartagena, Colombia.


10
0:0:29,575 --> 0:0:37,3



11
0:0:37,3 --> 0:0:39,75
The city basically looks like
it was constructed from the


12
0:0:39,75 --> 0:0:43,24
daydreams of frustrated
nine-to-fivers.


13
0:0:43,24 --> 0:0:46,4
You can picture some fat guy in
a cubicle going, goddamn, I


14
0:0:46,4 --> 0:0:48,9
just wish I was on a beach
somewhere that was more


15
0:0:48,9 --> 0:0:51,46
beautiful than any beach I've
ever seen in a city with


16
0:0:51,46 --> 0:0:54,36
absolutely beautiful
architecture and filled with


17
0:0:54,36 --> 0:0:55,61
gorgeous women.


18
0:0:55,61 --> 0:0:58,7



19
0:0:58,7 --> 0:0:58,95
That's Cartagena.


20
0:0:58,95 --> 0:1:5,22
[MUSIC PLAYING]


21
0:1:5,22 --> 0:1:6,95
RYAN DUFFY: Some of our friends
had been telling us


22
0:1:6,95 --> 0:1:10,712
that on the northern coast of
Colombia, people fuck donkeys.


23
0:1:10,712 --> 0:1:13,49



24
0:1:13,49 --> 0:1:15,46
Foolishly, we basically
said, we'll believe


25
0:1:15,46 --> 0:1:16,74
that when we see it.


26
0:1:16,74 --> 0:1:19,76
So we flew down to Cartagena
and figured we'd do some


27
0:1:19,76 --> 0:1:21,1
investigating of our own.


28
0:1:21,1 --> 0:1:28,17



29
0:1:28,17 --> 0:1:29,95
ANASTASIA MALONEY: It's a
really macho culture.


30
0:1:29,95 --> 0:1:31,49
And they really value
the chase here.


31
0:1:31,49 --> 0:1:36,3
Colombian men think the chase
is incredibly important.


32
0:1:36,3 --> 0:1:36,85
I'm from London.


33
0:1:36,85 --> 0:1:38,41
I'm a freelance journalist
here.


34
0:1:38,41 --> 0:1:41,37
I've been living here
for five years.


35
0:1:41,37 --> 0:1:42,63
And I'm married to
a Colombian.


36
0:1:42,63 --> 0:1:44,71
Colombian men think they're the
best dancers in the world


37
0:1:44,71 --> 0:1:47,16
because they've never had anyone
to tell them otherwise.


38
0:1:47,16 --> 0:1:48,66
People used to talk, and they
used to say, oh, the


39
0:1:48,66 --> 0:1:50,23
Costonians are--


40
0:1:50,23 --> 0:1:52,66
all they do is party,
they drink, and--


41
0:1:52,66 --> 0:1:53,83
the joke was--


42
0:1:53,83 --> 0:1:55,4
they fuck donkeys.


43
0:1:55,4 --> 0:1:56,33
No one actually said,
I've done it.


44
0:1:56,33 --> 0:1:58,62
They'd always said, oh no, my
friends have done it, and it's


45
0:1:58,62 --> 0:2:3,26
quite common that you lived on a
farm, you'll see people with


46
0:2:3,26 --> 0:2:4,29
their own special donkey.


47
0:2:4,29 --> 0:2:5,79
And yes, it's something
that you do.


48
0:2:5,79 --> 0:2:8,83
It's totally cultural
and it's normal.


49
0:2:8,83 --> 0:2:11,61
It's just a different
way of seeing sex.


50
0:2:11,61 --> 0:2:13,17
It's just a different way
of looking at it.


51
0:2:13,17 --> 0:2:14,935
RYAN DUFFY: Right.

[MUSIC PLAYING]


63
0:3:14,108 --> 0:3:16,426
RYAN DUFFY: We're here in
Turbaco, which is just a


64
0:3:16,426 --> 0:3:18,6
little bit outside
of Cartagena.


65
0:3:18,6 --> 0:3:20,14
We're getting a tour
of the land from


66
0:3:20,14 --> 0:3:21,31
our new friends here.


67
0:3:21,31 --> 0:3:23,315
And then we're going to
go see about this


68
0:3:23,315 --> 0:3:24,565
donkey fucking thing.


69
0:3:24,565 --> 0:3:35,32



70
0:3:35,32 --> 0:3:38,18
So when we got back from
Colombia, we were so freaked


71
0:3:38,18 --> 0:3:41,86
out and so totally confused by
what we'd seen and what you're


72
0:3:41,86 --> 0:3:44,8
about to see that we felt like
we really had to go see a sex


73
0:3:44,8 --> 0:3:47,22
therapist, if only so we didn't
spend the next two


74
0:3:47,22 --> 0:3:50,57
weeks of our lives crying
in the fetal position.


75
0:3:50,57 --> 0:3:53,32
So we're here in the offices
of Dr. Hani Miletski.


76
0:3:53,32 --> 0:3:55,9
She is the author of this book,
which is Understanding


77
0:3:55,9 --> 0:3:57,65
Bestiality and Zoophilia.


78
0:3:57,65 --> 0:4:0,79
Could you break down what's
bestiality, what's zoophilia?


79
0:4:0,79 --> 0:4:2,43
What are the differences
in terms?


80
0:4:2,43 --> 0:4:4,73
HANI MILETSKI: There's
really very different


81
0:4:4,73 --> 0:4:6,14
things, those two.


82
0:4:6,14 --> 0:4:8,67
Bestiality is sex
with animals.


83
0:4:8,67 --> 0:4:10,75
That's the act.


84
0:4:10,75 --> 0:4:16,89
And zoophilia is more about
feelings, about attraction.


85
0:4:16,89 --> 0:4:18,95
When somebody uses "zoophile,"
it's sort of like a sexual


86
0:4:18,95 --> 0:4:22,84
orientation in a way, while
bestiality is sort of like


87
0:4:22,84 --> 0:4:26,1
using the animal as a form
of masturbation.


88
0:4:26,1 --> 0:4:30,23
Bestiality has been going on
throughout history in every


89
0:4:30,23 --> 0:4:31,38
culture, basically.


90
0:4:31,38 --> 0:4:35,8
In my book, I even mention
an agriculture society in


91
0:4:35,8 --> 0:4:37,94
northern Colombia
called Cagaba.


92
0:4:37,94 --> 0:4:42,99
And in that society, it is an
ancient pre-Colombian belief.


93
0:4:42,99 --> 0:4:46,3
"Adolescent males will not
achieve competence in marriage


94
0:4:46,3 --> 0:4:48,5
unless they practice intercourse
with donkeys."


95
0:4:48,5 --> 0:4:56,76
[MUSIC PLAYING]


96
0:4:56,76 --> 0:5:1,15
RYAN DUFFY: Colombia is very
religious and super Catholic.


97
0:5:1,15 --> 0:5:6,12
So a lot of these girls are not
having sex until they're


98
0:5:6,12 --> 0:5:7,49
married or whatever it is.


99
0:5:7,49 --> 0:5:11,15
All of which is fine, but all
of which leaves our friend


100
0:5:11,15 --> 0:5:16,4
over here and various other
14-year-olds with basically a


101
0:5:16,4 --> 0:5:18,708
six-year long case
of blue balls.


102

116
0:6:10,85 --> 0:6:25,96



117
0:6:25,96 --> 0:6:26,75
RYAN DUFFY: What's
with the whole


118
0:6:26,75 --> 0:6:28,2
initiation thing, anyway?


119
0:6:28,2 --> 0:6:29,93
You're not going to find that
in the States, right?


120
0:6:29,93 --> 0:6:31,84
You get initiated together.


121
0:6:31,84 --> 0:6:34,39
It's 13-year-old boys and girls
in rec rooms groping


122
0:6:34,39 --> 0:6:37,13
each other and it's awkward and
terrible, but they're of


123
0:6:37,13 --> 0:6:38,71
the same species.


124
0:6:38,71 --> 0:6:41,9
So what's keeping that
from happening here?


125
0:6:41,9 --> 0:6:43,6
ANASTASIA MALONEY: There comes
a certain age of 12, 13, 14,


126
0:6:43,6 --> 0:6:46,15
and if they hadn't had a sexual
experience, they hadn't


127
0:6:46,15 --> 0:6:48,21
had sex, then they're
not a man.


128
0:6:48,21 --> 0:6:50,18
I mean, they just can't
go around saying


129
0:6:50,18 --> 0:6:51,72
that they're a virgin.


130
0:6:51,72 --> 0:6:54,16
RYAN DUFFY: So in junior high,
a lot of credibility is based


131
0:6:54,16 --> 0:6:59,48
on how many people you've made
out with and all that stuff.


132
0:6:59,48 --> 0:7:2,605
So we're trying to sort out here
which one of these two


133
0:7:2,605 --> 0:7:3,48
little guys--


134
0:7:3,48 --> 0:7:6,97
both of them are 14-- have
fucked more donkeys.


135
0:7:6,97 --> 0:7:8,22
MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING SPANISH]

0:7:8,22 --> 0:7:12,25

0:7:15,441 --> 0:7:16,797

0:7:16,797 --> 0:7:18,258

0:7:35,43 --> 0:7:36,696
MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING SPANISH]


145
0:7:36,696 --> 0:7:41,36



146
0:7:41,36 --> 0:7:42,2
RYAN DUFFY: Oh my god.


147
0:7:42,2 --> 0:7:43,46
MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING SPANISH]


148
0:7:43,46 --> 0:7:50,86



149
0:7:50,86 --> 0:7:55,8
RYAN DUFFY: We heard a lot of
different reasoning from the


150
0:7:55,8 --> 0:7:58,21
folks we spoke to down there.


151
0:7:58,21 --> 0:8:2,35
And it ran the gamut between
really practical reasons to


152
0:8:2,35 --> 0:8:5,35
stuff that we found a little
more far-fetched, like, oh, it


153
0:8:5,35 --> 0:8:7,715
enlarges the size
of the penis.


154
0:8:7,715 --> 0:8:10,83
HANI MILETSKI: I have heard
that there are other


155
0:8:10,83 --> 0:8:15,2
civilizations who believe that
having sex with an animal,


156
0:8:15,2 --> 0:8:16,38
specifically donkey--


157
0:8:16,38 --> 0:8:18,62
I mean, that's what
I came across--


158
0:8:18,62 --> 0:8:21,99
will enlarge penises.


159
0:8:21,99 --> 0:8:26,4
Like Muslim countries, fathers
will encourage their sons to


160
0:8:26,4 --> 0:8:31,14
have sex with a donkey so that
their penises will grow and


161
0:8:31,14 --> 0:8:33,976
that they will learn to
be better lovers.


162
0:8:33,976 --> 0:8:35,226
MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING SPANISH]


163
0:8:35,226 --> 0:8:50,95



164
0:8:50,95 --> 0:8:55,14
RYAN DUFFY: We're about a 35
minute cab ride outside of


165
0:8:55,14 --> 0:9:2,62
Cartagena, which is a beautiful
Caribbean city where


166
0:9:2,62 --> 0:9:3,9
I'd say-- a rough estimate--


167
0:9:3,9 --> 0:9:8,594
every other girl is a fucking
10, give or take.


168
0:9:8,594 --> 0:9:11,61
And the ugly girls are sevens.


169
0:9:11,61 --> 0:9:16,37
And we are here, 35 minutes
from there, and our friend


170
0:9:16,37 --> 0:9:18,19
here is going to
fuck a donkey.


171
0:9:18,19 --> 0:9:24,495
[MUSIC PLAYING]


172
0:9:24,495 --> 0:9:27,42



173
0:9:27,42 --> 0:9:29,76
RYAN DUFFY: So after talking to
all these folks in Turbaco,


174
0:9:29,76 --> 0:9:32,87
hearing all their stories,
pretty much thought that we'd


175
0:9:32,87 --> 0:9:35,68
heard and seen it all.


176
0:9:35,68 --> 0:9:39,68
Little did we know that our
cab driver was so happy to


177
0:9:39,68 --> 0:9:43,95
help and eager to share this
part of the culture with us,


178
0:9:43,95 --> 0:9:46,468
that we were about to see
a whole lot more.


179
0:9:46,468 --> 0:9:54,73
[MUSIC PLAYING]


180
0:9:54,73 --> 0:9:56,87
RYAN DUFFY: So Martin took
us out to this field.


181
0:9:56,87 --> 0:9:59,95
And the sun was setting and
there were all kinds of trees


182
0:9:59,95 --> 0:10:3,12
and a couple little lakes, and
it was quite beautiful.


183
0:10:3,12 --> 0:10:4,37
MARTIN: [SPEAKING SPANISH]


184
0:10:4,37 --> 0:10:49,34



185
0:10:49,34 --> 0:10:51,51
HANI MILETSKI: What I'm hearing
from people who had


186
0:10:51,51 --> 0:10:55,95
sex with animals and then they
want to have sex with humans,


187
0:10:55,95 --> 0:10:58,4
how different it is for them--


188
0:10:58,4 --> 0:11:2,76
that they're not equipped with
the knowledge of what to do


189
0:11:2,76 --> 0:11:6,54
when-- they call it "mind
games." That with people you


190
0:11:6,54 --> 0:11:8,93
have to play mind games and you
have to figure out what


191
0:11:8,93 --> 0:11:12,25
they want, while the animals,
it's like it's right there.


192
0:11:12,25 --> 0:11:15,23
And then, if you try
to translate


193
0:11:15,23 --> 0:11:18,2
that to humans, it's--


194
0:11:18,2 --> 0:11:20,27
humans are a lot more
complicated.


195
0:11:20,27 --> 0:11:23,31
On top of the fact that
sometimes it feels different.


196
0:11:23,31 --> 0:11:27,23
Especially, I hear from men who
had sex with female dogs


197
0:11:27,23 --> 0:11:30,6
that the female dogs
are a lot tighter.


198
0:11:30,6 --> 0:11:34,35
And they say, after you had
sex with a female dog, you


199
0:11:34,35 --> 0:11:36,22
don't want to have sex
with a woman anymore.


200
0:11:36,22 --> 0:11:37,47
MARTIN: [SPEAKING SPANISH]


201
0:11:37,47 --> 0:12:0,82



202
0:12:0,82 --> 0:12:3,4
HANI MILETSKI: And even when it
comes to zoophilia, I mean


203
0:12:3,4 --> 0:12:6,4
like sexual orientation, there's
different degrees.


204
0:12:6,4 --> 0:12:9,22
Somebody may be completely
straight and somebody may be


205
0:12:9,22 --> 0:12:11,83
completely gay, but there's all
these different shades in


206
0:12:11,83 --> 0:12:12,54
the middle.


207
0:12:12,54 --> 0:12:15,49
And I think Martin is somewhere
in the middle,


208
0:12:15,49 --> 0:12:20,42
because he has a wife and I'm
assuming he has sex with her,


209
0:12:20,42 --> 0:12:24,17
but because he was talking
about, fantasizing about,


210
0:12:24,17 --> 0:12:29,65
women, I would assume that
he's not completely zoo.


211
0:12:29,65 --> 0:12:32,5
He's somewhere in between.


212
0:12:32,5 --> 0:12:33,3
MARTIN: [SPEAKING SPANISH]

RYAN DUFFY: So Martin is
back there preparing.


216
0:13:3,45 --> 0:13:6,34
He's getting himself
aroused and


217
0:13:6,34 --> 0:13:7,8
preparing to fuck the donkey.


218
0:13:7,8 --> 0:13:11,37



219
0:13:11,37 --> 0:13:12,74
So he's going to give
us a shout when


220
0:13:12,74 --> 0:13:15,13
he's ready to mount.


221
0:13:15,13 --> 0:13:19,39



222
0:13:19,39 --> 0:13:21,89
There's nothing good.


223
0:13:21,89 --> 0:13:25,95
It's walking behind a tree
to find a-- oh no.


224
0:13:25,95 --> 0:13:27,2
Oh no.


225
0:13:27,2 --> 0:13:29,71



226
0:13:29,71 --> 0:13:31,77
It's like the surprise you knew
was coming and you didn't


227
0:13:31,77 --> 0:13:33,9
want to be there.

0:13:48,85 --> 0:13:50,69
RYAN DUFFY: Really
not into it, man.


230
0:13:50,69 --> 0:13:55,62
It's one of those careful what
you ask for situations where I


231
0:13:55,62 --> 0:13:57,75
thought it was going to be
really funny, and now I'm so


232
0:13:57,75 --> 0:13:59,99
bummed and there's not
enough fucking


233
0:13:59,99 --> 0:14:4,2
rum in all of Colombia.


234
0:14:4,2 --> 0:14:5,54
We were told a variety
of reasons that


235
0:14:5,54 --> 0:14:7,12
this might be happening.


236
0:14:7,12 --> 0:14:9,8
We were told it's a
gender role thing.


237
0:14:9,8 --> 0:14:11,34
We were told it has to do
with the predominant


238
0:14:11,34 --> 0:14:13,49
Catholicism in Colombia.


239
0:14:13,49 --> 0:14:15,54
Even an economic reason
was suggested to us.


240
0:14:15,54 --> 0:14:17,77
There's a million things.


241
0:14:17,77 --> 0:14:20,3
I'm not going to wrap this up
in any tidy package, because


242
0:14:20,3 --> 0:14:20,85
it doesn't exist.


243
0:14:20,85 --> 0:14:25,27
I watched a man fuck a donkey,
and it probably changed me for


244
0:14:25,27 --> 0:14:26,4
the rest of my life.


245
0:14:26,4 --> 0:14:29,34
But the reality probably is that
there are probably people


246
0:14:29,34 --> 0:14:31,88
fucking animals all over
the fucking place.


247
0:14:31,88 --> 0:14:35,3
And it's certainly not
distinctly a Colombian thing.


248
0:14:35,3 --> 0:14:37,34
Now I definitely think it's
safe to say that we really


249
0:14:37,34 --> 0:14:38,74
have seen it all.


250
0:14:38,74 --> 0:14:40,79
Way too damn much, in fact.


251
0:14:40,79 --> 0:14:43,98
Even now, back in New York,
everywhere I look, I keep


252
0:14:43,98 --> 0:14:45,57
seeing these Colombian
donkeys.
