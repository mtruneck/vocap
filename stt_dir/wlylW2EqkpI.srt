0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:5,63



2
0:0:5,63 --> 0:0:8,37
JASON DILL: Workshop got divided
into upriver and


3
0:0:8,37 --> 0:0:8,795
downriver at one point.


4
0:0:8,795 --> 0:0:12,68
And now that Kalis is gone,
there's less upriver.


5
0:0:12,68 --> 0:0:15,92
Like Dyrdek, Mikey Taylor,
Barra, is so upriver.


6
0:0:15,92 --> 0:0:16,785
INTERVIEWER: What
does that mean?


7
0:0:16,785 --> 0:0:19,43
JASON DILL: They're upriver.


8
0:0:19,43 --> 0:0:20,58
They're where--


9
0:0:20,58 --> 0:0:26,9
you know, where TVs exist, the
internet, fishing's better.


10
0:0:26,9 --> 0:0:28,83
BILL STROBECK: I could see where
it seemed like if Kalis


11
0:0:28,83 --> 0:0:31,46
felt that way, which I feel like
he did, that he felt like


12
0:0:31,46 --> 0:0:33,57
he didn't fit in.


13
0:0:33,57 --> 0:0:34,76
JOSH KALIS: First of all,
I can't be mad at


14
0:0:34,76 --> 0:0:36,44
anything Fat Bill says.


15
0:0:36,44 --> 0:0:38,65
Because Fat Bill is my homey.


16
0:0:38,65 --> 0:0:44,39
And he can fucking call me a
piece of shit jerk-off, and


17
0:0:44,39 --> 0:0:47,5
I'm not going to give a shit
because he's Fat Bill.


18
0:0:47,5 --> 0:0:49,55
He's my favorite filmer
to film with.


19
0:0:49,55 --> 0:0:51,13
I fucking love Bill.


20
0:0:51,13 --> 0:0:53,2
Dill, on the other hand--


21
0:0:53,2 --> 0:0:54,34
it really bummed me out.


22
0:0:54,34 --> 0:0:56,28
It was like a lack of respect.


23
0:0:56,28 --> 0:1:1,89
It was like, who the fuck are
you to talk about me, in one,


24
0:1:1,89 --> 0:1:4,209
Dylan's thing.


25
0:1:4,209 --> 0:1:4,489
You know?


26
0:1:4,489 --> 0:1:7,5
And two, call me upriver.


27
0:1:7,5 --> 0:1:10,6
I mean, my thinking
is like, hey, man.


28
0:1:10,6 --> 0:1:12,37
I'm about as street
as you get.


29
0:1:12,37 --> 0:1:13,822
You know what I'm saying?


30
0:1:13,822 --> 0:1:19,63



31
0:1:19,63 --> 0:1:21,66
PATRICK O'DELL: Welcome back
to Epicly Later'd.


32
0:1:21,66 --> 0:1:24,14
This episode's about
Josh Kalis.


33
0:1:24,14 --> 0:1:25,91
This episode kind of came
to be because of the


34
0:1:25,91 --> 0:1:27,55
Dylan Rieder episode.


35
0:1:27,55 --> 0:1:31,58
Dill said some stuff and
Kalis didn't like it.


36
0:1:31,58 --> 0:1:34,72
He called me and was bummed and
kind of wanted to set the


37
0:1:34,72 --> 0:1:35,42
record straight.


38
0:1:35,42 --> 0:1:36,73
He's like, I got stories.


39
0:1:36,73 --> 0:1:38,83
I was in an insane asylum.


40
0:1:38,83 --> 0:1:39,56
I did this.


41
0:1:39,56 --> 0:1:40,3
I did that.


42
0:1:40,3 --> 0:1:40,74
I was like, all right.


43
0:1:40,74 --> 0:1:41,99
This is gonna be awesome.


44
0:1:41,99 --> 0:1:44,26



45
0:1:44,26 --> 0:1:47,0
So I first started hearing
of him in Timecode.


46
0:1:47,0 --> 0:1:48,63
I really remember him
doing kickflip


47
0:1:48,63 --> 0:1:49,75
backside noseblunt slides.


48
0:1:49,75 --> 0:1:51,69
And I think I shot a photo
of him doing one.


49
0:1:51,69 --> 0:1:53,52
I just think of backside
tricks, like backside


50
0:1:53,52 --> 0:1:55,88
noseblunt slides and backside
tail slides.


51
0:1:55,88 --> 0:1:58,8
And crooked hat, like
all the way crooked.


52
0:1:58,8 --> 0:2:1,67
And like earrings, and
like, dirt 'stache.


53
0:2:1,67 --> 0:2:5,305
So I met up with Kalis and
talked about skating.


54
0:2:5,305 --> 0:2:9,9
We talked about Lennie Kirk,
Dyrdek, Stevie, Philly,


55
0:2:9,9 --> 0:2:12,59
Chicago, Texas, all
this stuff.


56
0:2:12,59 --> 0:2:15,23
So it's cool to interview
someone that's


57
0:2:15,23 --> 0:2:17,91
such a skate rat.


58
0:2:17,91 --> 0:2:19,93
Like he's like die-hard
skater.


59
0:2:19,93 --> 0:2:22,34
And just go through
skate history.


60
0:2:22,34 --> 0:2:23,23
I don't know.


61
0:2:23,23 --> 0:2:26,48
I'm really excited about
this episode.


62
0:2:26,48 --> 0:2:27,28
So here it is--


63
0:2:27,28 --> 0:2:29,722
Josh Kalis episode.


64
0:2:29,722 --> 0:2:31,97
Where do you think'd
be the best zone?


65
0:2:31,97 --> 0:2:33,22
JOSH KALIS: This is
good right here.


66
0:2:33,22 --> 0:2:35,34



67
0:2:35,34 --> 0:2:37,97
PATRICK O'DELL: These big-ass
SoCal houses don't even have


68
0:2:37,97 --> 0:2:41,34
lights in the ceiling
anywhere.


69
0:2:41,34 --> 0:2:44,45
JOSH KALIS: Actually, before I
skated, my biggest thing was


70
0:2:44,45 --> 0:2:45,61
rollerskating.


71
0:2:45,61 --> 0:2:48,36
I was like this big speedskater
kid, you know?


72
0:2:48,36 --> 0:2:50,82
Well, what killed my roller
skating was that I


73
0:2:50,82 --> 0:2:52,48
had lied to the cops.


74
0:2:52,48 --> 0:2:54,8
Well, I used to go roller
skating every weekend, but


75
0:2:54,8 --> 0:2:57,58
then I lied to the cops about
getting kidnapped.


76
0:2:57,58 --> 0:3:0,73
Or not getting kidnapped, but
I told them that this


77
0:3:0,73 --> 0:3:2,76
kidnapper was out, like,
trying to get me.


78
0:3:2,76 --> 0:3:5,57
It was like the big thing at
school, was this kidnapper.


79
0:3:5,57 --> 0:3:8,14
So I lied and said that
I met the dude.


80
0:3:8,14 --> 0:3:9,91
And they broke me down
in the cop shop.


81
0:3:9,91 --> 0:3:11,57
I mean, they broke me down.


82
0:3:11,57 --> 0:3:11,905
I was tearing.


83
0:3:11,905 --> 0:3:13,72
I told them I was
full of shit.


84
0:3:13,72 --> 0:3:16,36
So my dad grounded me from
my roller skates


85
0:3:16,36 --> 0:3:17,87
for like six months.


86
0:3:17,87 --> 0:3:19,85
And it was like, that was it.


87
0:3:19,85 --> 0:3:23,43
I didn't even give a shit
about it anymore.


88
0:3:23,43 --> 0:3:26,26
Going way back to my first days
of skating, it was the


89
0:3:26,26 --> 0:3:27,82
Bones Brigade.


90
0:3:27,82 --> 0:3:31,61
Steve Caballero was probably
like my favorite dude out of


91
0:3:31,61 --> 0:3:32,64
all of them.


92
0:3:32,64 --> 0:3:35,75
I don't remember what Powell
video it was, but it was


93
0:3:35,75 --> 0:3:38,207
Caballero and Tommy Guerrero
and all those dudes were


94
0:3:38,207 --> 0:3:39,36
skating outside.


95
0:3:39,36 --> 0:3:41,32
Like there was a neighborhood.


96
0:3:41,32 --> 0:3:43,74
And that's what I
kept watching.


97
0:3:43,74 --> 0:3:45,81
The vert stuff and none of
that, I didn't even pay


98
0:3:45,81 --> 0:3:46,37
attention to it.


99
0:3:46,37 --> 0:3:48,33
I just would rewind
and fast forward.


100
0:3:48,33 --> 0:3:50,434
And I think that's what
got me, right there.


101
0:3:50,434 --> 0:3:55,274



102
0:3:55,274 --> 0:3:56,726
Gonna do some tricks, man.


103
0:3:56,726 --> 0:3:59,545



104
0:3:59,545 --> 0:4:1,22
MIKE BLABAC: I first
met Josh--


105
0:4:1,22 --> 0:4:3,5
I lived in Lansing, Michigan.


106
0:4:3,5 --> 0:4:5,34
We just kind of knew one another
through skating.


107
0:4:5,34 --> 0:4:7,4
He knew that I shot photos.


108
0:4:7,4 --> 0:4:9,5
So he'd come down to
Grand Rapids and


109
0:4:9,5 --> 0:4:11,31
shoot photos with me.


110
0:4:11,31 --> 0:4:11,87
It's funny.


111
0:4:11,87 --> 0:4:13,95
He got grounded.


112
0:4:13,95 --> 0:4:16,51
His dad-- like, he stole a bunch
of baseball cards and


113
0:4:16,51 --> 0:4:19,41
shit of his dad's, and he got
grounded for hella long.


114
0:4:19,41 --> 0:4:20,38
I don't even know how long.


115
0:4:20,38 --> 0:4:22,91
But he lied and he told his
dad that I worked for


116
0:4:22,91 --> 0:4:23,6
TransWorld.


117
0:4:23,6 --> 0:4:27,29
So his dad would let him go out
and shoot photos with me.


118
0:4:27,29 --> 0:4:29,55
He thought that I was like some
magazine photographer.


119
0:4:29,55 --> 0:4:32,3
And I barely knew how
to use a camera.


120
0:4:32,3 --> 0:4:33,66
But I was just kind
of learning how.


121
0:4:33,66 --> 0:4:36,84
And it's sort of ironic that
he's one of the dudes that I


122
0:4:36,84 --> 0:4:38,63
learned how to shoot
skate photos of.


123
0:4:38,63 --> 0:4:40,18
That's what he looked like.


124
0:4:40,18 --> 0:4:40,55
It's hella funny.


125
0:4:40,55 --> 0:4:41,51
PATRICK O'DELL: That's Josh?


126
0:4:41,51 --> 0:4:42,2
MIKE BLABAC: Yeah.


127
0:4:42,2 --> 0:4:44,47
That's Josh in 1989.


128
0:4:44,47 --> 0:4:47,34
So that was 21 years ago.


129
0:4:47,34 --> 0:4:49,52
It makes me feel hella old,
thinking about how long ago


130
0:4:49,52 --> 0:4:50,68
that was, but yeah.


131
0:4:50,68 --> 0:4:52,11
That was the skate-rat Josh.


132
0:4:52,11 --> 0:4:54,6



133
0:4:54,6 --> 0:4:59,38
And then I met the Josh with his
earrings and fucking pot


134
0:4:59,38 --> 0:5:2,63
leaf and like the thugged-out
Josh in SF,


135
0:5:2,63 --> 0:5:5,52
about four years later.


136
0:5:5,52 --> 0:5:7,91
PATRICK O'DELL: And you saw
Sheffey then, too, right?


137
0:5:7,91 --> 0:5:10,52
MIKE BLABAC: Back when I lived
in Michigan, yeah.


138
0:5:10,52 --> 0:5:12,82
He was the Sheffey with the
big hair, you know?


139
0:5:12,82 --> 0:5:13,81
Sheffey from the videos
and stuff.


140
0:5:13,81 --> 0:5:14,61
It was sick.


141
0:5:14,61 --> 0:5:18,22
I remember he was just hauling
ass, going as fast as you


142
0:5:18,22 --> 0:5:18,88
possibly could.


143
0:5:18,88 --> 0:5:20,79
Yeah, it was insane.


144
0:5:20,79 --> 0:5:22,18
Like crazy--


145
0:5:22,18 --> 0:5:25,11
like how much power he had
and how fast he went.


146
0:5:25,11 --> 0:5:27,78
That was the raddest thing
about watching


147
0:5:27,78 --> 0:5:28,97
him skate in person.


148
0:5:28,97 --> 0:5:29,83
You know what I mean?


149
0:5:29,83 --> 0:5:31,69
Yeah, he was a pretty
main dude.


150
0:5:31,69 --> 0:5:34,51
It just so happened that he
lived in Grand Rapids.


151
0:5:34,51 --> 0:5:37,24
JON LEE: I'll show you the three
raddest skateboarders


152
0:5:37,24 --> 0:5:38,6
that I know.


153
0:5:38,6 --> 0:5:41,19
The vegetarian powers.


154
0:5:41,19 --> 0:5:50,11
Sean Sheffey, by far the
raddest, craziest, gnarliest


155
0:5:50,11 --> 0:5:51,36
skateboarder.


156
0:5:51,36 --> 0:5:53,3



157
0:5:53,3 --> 0:5:56,32
JOSH KALIS: It was like this
myth, urban legend.


158
0:5:56,32 --> 0:5:58,32
And it wasn't until
like a year after


159
0:5:58,32 --> 0:6:0,45
that that I was downtown.


160
0:6:0,45 --> 0:6:2,99
We were maybe 50-50-ing
granite curbs,


161
0:6:2,99 --> 0:6:4,82
trying to do that shit.


162
0:6:4,82 --> 0:6:6,36
And this dude with this big-ass
'fro just comes


163
0:6:6,36 --> 0:6:10,23
through and back lips one of
the full-sized benches.


164
0:6:10,23 --> 0:6:11,425
Our jaws hit the ground.


165
0:6:11,425 --> 0:6:13,16
We were like, Sean Sheffey.


166
0:6:13,16 --> 0:6:14,75
Holy shit, man.


167
0:6:14,75 --> 0:6:15,39
PATRICK O'DELL: It's definitely


168
0:6:15,39 --> 0:6:16,98
like seeing a legend.


169
0:6:16,98 --> 0:6:19,24
JOSH KALIS: Well, one of the
cool things about skating with


170
0:6:19,24 --> 0:6:21,89
him back then was like, you
didn't want to sit down.


171
0:6:21,89 --> 0:6:26,5
Like he gave you that vibe and
that energy, where like, if he


172
0:6:26,5 --> 0:6:29,69
was skating five stairs, he
wanted you to skate with him.


173
0:6:29,69 --> 0:6:32,56
I swear to god I learned more
tricks that day, just skating


174
0:6:32,56 --> 0:6:37,26
with that dude, than I ever
have, even still to this day.


175
0:6:37,26 --> 0:6:38,55
And he would just--


176
0:6:38,55 --> 0:6:40,64
bounce to the next spot, and
everybody's trying to


177
0:6:40,64 --> 0:6:42,7
keep up with him.


178
0:6:42,7 --> 0:6:42,507
You know what I mean?


179
0:6:42,507 --> 0:6:45,7
It was sick, dude.


180
0:6:45,7 --> 0:6:46,66
SEAN SHEFFEY: What's up?


181
0:6:46,66 --> 0:6:49,4
PATRICK O'DELL: What up?


182
0:6:49,4 --> 0:6:52,2
JOSH KALIS: Ever since I met him
that day, that was like my


183
0:6:52,2 --> 0:6:55,725
drive to want to skate
and always skate.


184
0:6:55,725 --> 0:6:58,75
And like, just Sheffey, dude.


185
0:6:58,75 --> 0:7:0,0
The illest dude, ever.


186
0:7:0,0 --> 0:7:1,79
Ever.


187
0:7:1,79 --> 0:7:3,41
PATRICK O'DELL: Does he you
remember you from then?


188
0:7:3,41 --> 0:7:5,56
JOSH KALIS: You'll
have to ask him.


189
0:7:5,56 --> 0:7:6,52
I've never asked him.


190
0:7:6,52 --> 0:7:7,66
I always played it cool.


191
0:7:7,66 --> 0:7:9,25
Like, that's Sean, you
know what I mean?


192
0:7:9,25 --> 0:7:12,72
I ain't fucking with
that dude.


193
0:7:12,72 --> 0:7:14,655
PATRICK O'DELL: There's a lot
of skate history in here.


194
0:7:14,655 --> 0:7:16,73
SEAN SHEFFEY: I would like
to say what's up


195
0:7:16,73 --> 0:7:18,55
to the Wu Tang Clan.


196
0:7:18,55 --> 0:7:21,81
I was 17.


197
0:7:21,81 --> 0:7:25,1
I remember I was going
by your house once--


198
0:7:25,1 --> 0:7:27,8
JOSH KALIS: Oh my god,
that's the story.


199
0:7:27,8 --> 0:7:29,93
SEAN SHEFFEY: And this
elementary school where they


200
0:7:29,93 --> 0:7:31,71
used to skate, with
the yellow curbs.


201
0:7:31,71 --> 0:7:32,32
Remember that?


202
0:7:32,32 --> 0:7:32,61
JOSH KALIS: Yeah.


203
0:7:32,61 --> 0:7:34,25
Oh, I can't believe this
dude remembers me, man.


204
0:7:34,25 --> 0:7:35,24
SEAN SHEFFEY: Yeah.


205
0:7:35,24 --> 0:7:36,53
JOSH KALIS: Yeah,
I was grounded.


206
0:7:36,53 --> 0:7:38,53
I was grounded in my room.


207
0:7:38,53 --> 0:7:39,92
And it must have been
for like, I think,


208
0:7:39,92 --> 0:7:41,26
three or four weeks.


209
0:7:41,26 --> 0:7:42,52
I can't believe this
story, man.


210
0:7:42,52 --> 0:7:44,52
My dad comes in my room,
knocking on the door.


211
0:7:44,52 --> 0:7:48,854
And he's like, hey, there's some
guys out in the driveway.


212
0:7:48,854 --> 0:7:49,85
And I was like, what?


213
0:7:49,85 --> 0:7:52,59
So I went out there and I
looked, and it was Ted Lee--


214
0:7:52,59 --> 0:7:53,79
SEAN SHEFFEY: Yeah.


215
0:7:53,79 --> 0:7:55,41
JOSH KALIS: And Sheffey.


216
0:7:55,41 --> 0:7:56,24
SEAN SHEFFEY: And myself.


217
0:7:56,24 --> 0:7:58,81
JOSH KALIS: Tooling around in my
driveway, trying to see if


218
0:7:58,81 --> 0:8:0,6
I could skate.


219
0:8:0,6 --> 0:8:3,29



220
0:8:3,29 --> 0:8:4,54
Ted Lee.


221
0:8:4,54 --> 0:8:7,53



222
0:8:7,53 --> 0:8:11,6
And I was like, oh my god.
'Cause this was after I had


223
0:8:11,6 --> 0:8:12,87
started seeing them downtown.


224
0:8:12,87 --> 0:8:15,425
And my dad let me off grounding
to go skate with


225
0:8:15,425 --> 0:8:16,51
these dudes for a while.


226
0:8:16,51 --> 0:8:17,525
He let me off.


227
0:8:17,525 --> 0:8:18,55
I couldn't believe it, man.


228
0:8:18,55 --> 0:8:20,73
That was like the best day
in my entire life.


229
0:8:20,73 --> 0:8:21,55
SEAN SHEFFEY: Oh, wow.


230
0:8:21,55 --> 0:8:22,565
He let you out?


231
0:8:22,565 --> 0:8:23,95
Yeah, that's intense.


232
0:8:23,95 --> 0:8:24,32
Cool.


233
0:8:24,32 --> 0:8:26,19
JOSH KALIS: Yeah, that was
pretty insane, man.


234
0:8:26,19 --> 0:8:28,445
Damn, you remember that shit.


235
0:8:28,445 --> 0:8:29,99
MALE SPEAKER: Film Jack.


236
0:8:29,99 --> 0:8:31,6
MALE SPEAKER: Less
work for you.


237
0:8:31,6 --> 0:8:31,57
Go ahead.


238
0:8:31,57 --> 0:8:34,309
JOSH KALIS: You gonna
follow me?


239
0:8:34,309 --> 0:8:36,289
PATRICK O'DELL: Dude, what do
you remember about Josh?


240
0:8:36,289 --> 0:8:40,25
SEAN SHEFFEY: Very already
mature skater and sharp when


241
0:8:40,25 --> 0:8:41,32
we first met him.


242
0:8:41,32 --> 0:8:46,5
He was already known around his
city and state as being a


243
0:8:46,5 --> 0:8:48,21
sharp and clean skater.


244
0:8:48,21 --> 0:8:50,67
So I was pretty impressed
when I first met him.


245
0:8:50,67 --> 0:8:51,41
JOSH KALIS: Aw, shit.


246
0:8:51,41 --> 0:8:53,76
That's only because I was
out with the big dogs.


247
0:8:53,76 --> 0:8:58,48
And I was trying my hardest,
dude, to do my thing.


248
0:8:58,48 --> 0:9:0,754
I didn't want to look like
no punk out there.


249
0:9:0,754 --> 0:9:1,726
Yeah.


250
0:9:1,726 --> 0:9:4,642
[CAR HORN HONKING]


251
0:9:4,642 --> 0:9:5,892
JOSH KALIS: Huh.


252
0:9:5,892 --> 0:9:8,6



253
0:9:8,6 --> 0:9:10,96
SEAN SHEFFEY: Great experience
to see how far he's came with


254
0:9:10,96 --> 0:9:13,674
his skateboarding and
progressed, and the


255
0:9:13,674 --> 0:9:15,15
technicality of it.


256
0:9:15,15 --> 0:9:17,44
I'm very proud to have
been a part of that.


257
0:9:17,44 --> 0:9:26,3



258
0:9:26,3 --> 0:9:28,9
JOSH KALIS: I've always loved
Matt Hensley's skating.


259
0:9:28,9 --> 0:9:31,5
He was like a huge one for me.


260
0:9:31,5 --> 0:9:35,43
But I think my early days of
learning how to kickflip and


261
0:9:35,43 --> 0:9:39,48
how I want to skate is directly
related to Sean's


262
0:9:39,48 --> 0:9:43,39
skating and that influence
he gave me, like live.


263
0:9:43,39 --> 0:9:45,29
The downtown-- our little
city wasn't that big.


264
0:9:45,29 --> 0:9:47,38
But it was like, we didn't want
to skate anything else


265
0:9:47,38 --> 0:9:52,21
besides downtown after we seen
Sean down there, you know?


266
0:9:52,21 --> 0:9:53,59
SEAN SHEFFEY: And what
is your sign?


267
0:9:53,59 --> 0:9:54,3
JOSH KALIS: Taurus.


268
0:9:54,3 --> 0:9:54,66
SEAN SHEFFEY: Taurus.


269
0:9:54,66 --> 0:9:59,51
Well, bullheaded and strong like
one, you are, Mr. Kalis.


270
0:9:59,51 --> 0:10:1,13
Nothing wrong with that.


271
0:10:1,13 --> 0:10:2,35
Pretty cool, yeah.


272
0:10:2,35 --> 0:10:2,95
Pretty cool.


273
0:10:2,95 --> 0:10:4,2
Strong sign.


274
0:10:4,2 --> 0:12:4,2
