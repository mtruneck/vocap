212
0:9:8,3 --> 0:9:11,56
You leave one job, but if you're
not economically or


213
0:9:11,56 --> 0:9:13,23
personally sufficient,
you trade it for


214
0:9:13,23 --> 0:9:14,8
another job, right?


215
0:9:14,8 --> 0:9:14,55
FREDDY LIM: Yeah.


216
0:9:14,55 --> 0:9:18,67
EDDIE HUANG: And you're
constantly trading masters.


217
0:9:18,67 --> 0:9:21,32
Do you think Taiwan can be
independent on it's own


218
0:9:21,32 --> 0:9:23,26
without China, without America,


219
0:9:23,26 --> 0:9:24,32
without Japan, you know?


220
0:9:24,32 --> 0:9:28,1
Because if you need America to
get away from out from under


221
0:9:28,1 --> 0:9:31,2
China, then isn't that
your new master?


222
0:9:31,2 --> 0:9:31,44
I don't know.


223
0:9:31,44 --> 0:9:33,8
I'm just asking questions.


224
0:9:33,8 --> 0:9:35,6
FREDDY LIM: I really like
speaking all these kind of


225
0:9:35,6 --> 0:9:36,31
things with this make up.


226
0:9:36,31 --> 0:9:39,14



227
0:9:39,14 --> 0:9:39,65
EDDIE HUANG: Extra
appropriate.


228
0:9:39,65 --> 0:9:41,7
FREDDY LIM: That's great.


229
0:9:41,7 --> 0:9:45,82
EDDIE HUANG: Just in the last
60 years Chinese people have


230
0:9:45,82 --> 0:9:47,2
emigrated so many places.


231
0:9:47,2 --> 0:9:50,19
Taiwanese people have emigrated
so many places.


232
0:9:50,19 --> 0:9:53,1
And the identities are very,
very complicated, the


233
0:9:53,1 --> 0:9:55,26
political identities
even more so.


234
0:9:55,26 --> 0:9:58,53
And just on this shoot, our
fixers feel one way.


235
0:9:58,53 --> 0:10:0,34
Freddy feels one way.


236
0:10:0,34 --> 0:10:3,71
I'm kind of stuck in the
middle just trying to


237
0:10:3,71 --> 0:10:5,5
represent both sides.


238
0:10:5,5 --> 0:10:10,2
It's very, very interesting how
many angles there are to


239
0:10:10,2 --> 0:10:10,95
this topic.
