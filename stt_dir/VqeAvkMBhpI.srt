MATHEUS VARGAS (through translator): I was
at the door of the club as soon as the fire


2
0:0:16,849 --> 0:0:21,93
started. I saw people shouting "Fire! Fire!"
They were terrified. When I realized that


3
0:0:21,93 --> 0:0:23,96
there was fire, I rushed out of there.

0:0:24,46 --> 0:0:27,739
CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: Fire he is talking
about is the one at the nightclub in Brazil


6
0:0:27,739 --> 0:0:32,329
over the weekend, and that last thing he said
about rushing out is really important, because


7
0:0:32,329 --> 0:0:36,98
experts say that when a crisis happens, every
second counts. When you`re in a crowded place


8
0:0:36,98 --> 0:0:40,839
like a club or a theater, there are some thing
you can do to be ready for an emergency.


9
0:0:40,839 --> 0:0:41,489
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


10
0:0:41,489 --> 0:0:44,929
STEVE ALMASY, CNN PRODUCER/WRITER: Thanks,
Carl. We talked to some fire protection and


11
0:0:44,929 --> 0:0:49,98
life safety experts this week after the fire
in Brazil. And what they told us is, there


12
0:0:49,98 --> 0:0:53,98
are two things that are very important when
you are going to a venue or whether it`s a


13
0:0:53,98 --> 0:0:59,62
public event. And that`s preparation and don`t
hesitate if there`s an emergency. But another


14
0:0:59,62 --> 0:1:4,12
thing they told us is, before you even go,
make a plan with your friends where you`re


15
0:1:4,12 --> 0:1:7,89
going to meet in case something happens. It
might be the car, it might be a public transit


16
0:1:7,89 --> 0:1:12,59
stop, it might have to be some place else
in case the parking lot is too busy, or you


17
0:1:12,59 --> 0:1:16,909
can`t get to your car because it`s blocked.
So, what you do is like, say, you`re going


18
0:1:16,909 --> 0:1:23,14
to a movie theater or you go to a night club,
identify who the workers there are, they might


19
0:1:23,14 --> 0:1:27,53
be wearing a particular color shirt. You might
ask them where the extra exits are, or if


20
0:1:27,53 --> 0:1:32,59
they are unavailable to do that, then go,
take a lap around, or if you`re sitting in


21
0:1:32,59 --> 0:1:36,5
the movie theater, look around to see where
the extra exits are, because if an emergency


22
0:1:36,5 --> 0:1:40,0
happens, most people are going to head out
the way they came in, that`s what`s familiar


23
0:1:40,0 --> 0:1:44,74
to them, and people tend to stick with that.
If you familiarize yourself with the alternate


24
0:1:44,74 --> 0:1:49,179
exits, then that`s the way you`re going to
go, if you can in case there`s an emergency.


25
0:1:49,179 --> 0:1:55,59
Now, if you hear a fire alarm, don`t hesitate.
Head for the exits. One expert told me, it`s


26
0:1:55,59 --> 0:2:1,2
those ten seconds that can cost you your life.
So head for the door, if you can`t see, because


27
0:2:1,2 --> 0:2:5,49
the smoke is coming down, or it`s too sick,
then feel your way forward, go in a straight


28
0:2:5,49 --> 0:2:9,27
line until you hit a wall. When you hit the
wall, then you`re going to take your hand


29
0:2:9,27 --> 0:2:13,87
and you`re going to follow it around until
you get to maybe a door or you get to a window.


30
0:2:13,87 --> 0:2:14,56
(END VIDEOTAPE)


31
0:2:14,56 --> 0:2:18,409
AZUZ: Brazil is going through three days of
morning for the hundreds of people killed


32
0:2:18,409 --> 0:2:22,629
in that night club. Police have arrested several
people in connection with the fire, those


33
0:2:22,629 --> 0:2:27,3
people are being held temporarily, five days
to start with. Authorities say they need to


34
0:2:27,3 --> 0:2:29,93
do that in order to get more information for
their investigation.

36
0:2:31,629 --> 0:2:37,89
CESAR VALDEZ, UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANT: I went
to the registering office, and they just let


37
0:2:37,89 --> 0:2:43,319
me know, you know, you`re undocumented, the
laws have changed, you can`t register.


38
0:2:43,319 --> 0:2:46,379
(END VIDEO CLIP)


39
0:2:46,379 --> 0:2:51,34
AZUZ: Undocumented immigrants like Cesar Valdez
aren`t allowed to join the military because


40
0:2:51,34 --> 0:2:57,19
they are living in the U.S. illegally. Cesar
isn`t alone, there are about 11 million undocumented


41
0:2:57,19 --> 0:3:1,599
immigrants in the United States. A group of
senators want to give them the chance to stay


42
0:3:1,599 --> 0:3:2,64
here legally.


43
0:3:2,64 --> 0:3:3,14
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


44
0:3:3,14 --> 0:3:8,489
SEN. CHARLES SCHUMER, (D), NEW YORK: We believe
this will be the year Congress finally gets


45
0:3:8,489 --> 0:3:15,51
it done. The politics on this issue have been
turned upside down. For the first time ever,


46
0:3:15,51 --> 0:3:20,849
there`s more political risk in opposing immigration
reform than in supporting it.


47
0:3:20,849 --> 0:3:21,519
(END VIDEO CLIP)


48
0:3:21,519 --> 0:3:25,599
AZUZ: That was Senator Charles Schumer. He
is one of eight senators, four Democrats and


49
0:3:25,599 --> 0:3:30,51
four Republicans, who announced an immigration
reform plan yesterday. It includes things


50
0:3:30,51 --> 0:3:36,239
like overhauling the country`s legal immigration
system and creating a path to citizenship


51
0:3:36,239 --> 0:3:41,81
for undocumented immigrants. Critics sometimes
call that last part "amnesty". U.S. Representative


52
0:3:41,81 --> 0:3:44,849
Lamar Smith said it would make the situation
worse.


53
0:3:44,849 --> 0:3:50,549
"When you legalize those who are in the country
illegally, he says, it costs taxpayers millions


54
0:3:50,549 --> 0:3:56,409
of dollars, costs American workers thousands
of jobs and encourages more illegal immigration.


55
0:3:56,409 --> 0:4:1,769
By granting amnesty, the Senate proposal actually
compounds the problem by encouraging more


56
0:4:1,769 --> 0:4:5,51
illegal immigration." We`re going to have
more on this issue for you this week. The


57
0:4:5,51 --> 0:4:9,79
president is set to talk about it, and you
can always get the latest details at cnn.com.


58
0:4:9,79 --> 0:4:16,549
You`ve heard it over and over again, higher
education can mean higher pay. Here`s proof


59
0:4:16,549 --> 0:4:22,2
from cnnmoney. Without a high school diploma,
Americans earn an average of $478 a week.


60
0:4:22,2 --> 0:4:28,82
It works out to about $25,000. But if you
do get your diploma, look at the jump to $647


61
0:4:28,82 --> 0:4:34,99
a week, or more than $33,000 a year. Going
for a bachelor`s degree, you are likely to


62
0:4:34,99 --> 0:4:40,3
pull down more than a thousand dollars a week,
or over $55,000 a year. And a higher degree


63
0:4:40,3 --> 0:4:47,96
than that can spill out more than 1300 a week,
or over 71,000 a year. Keep in mind, higher


64
0:4:47,96 --> 0:4:53,5
education doesn`t necessarily mean a four
year college degree. If you go in a construction,


65
0:4:53,5 --> 0:4:57,57
for instance, you may need to go to trade
school or get a formal apprenticeship, and


66
0:4:57,57 --> 0:5:3,77
you can average $740 a week or a little under
$40,000 a year. Some registered nurses and


67
0:5:3,77 --> 0:5:9,699
dental hygienists who may have associates
degrees, can earn between $65 and $70,000


68
0:5:9,699 --> 0:5:14,889
a year. So the take away here, if you`re hoping
to make more money, is to make sure your education


69
0:5:14,889 --> 0:5:16,41
doesn`t stop at high school.

0:5:16,41 --> 0:5:17,52

71
0:5:17,52 --> 0:5:23,9
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It`s time for "The Shoutout."
"Parents can only give good advice or put


72
0:5:23,9 --> 0:5:27,71
them on the right path, but the final forming
of a person`s character lies in their own


73
0:5:27,71 --> 0:5:34,139
hands." Now, who said that? Was it Benjamin
Franklin, Anne Frank, Mohandas Gandhi, or


74
0:5:34,139 --> 0:5:41,24
Justin Bieber? You`ve got three seconds, go!


75
0:5:41,24 --> 0:5:49,0
Anne Frank wrote these words in her famous
diary. That`s your answer and that`s your


76
0:5:49,0 --> 0:5:49,58
"Shoutout."

78
0:5:51,3 --> 0:5:55,86
AZUZ: People showing their character is what
our next two stories are about. First one,


79
0:5:55,86 --> 0:6:0,99
from a restaurant in Houston. This is Milo
(ph). He`s five years old, and he has Down


80
0:6:0,99 --> 0:6:5,94
syndrome. Heno`s family went out to dinner
recently. When they sat down, the family in


81
0:6:5,94 --> 0:6:11,4
the next booth reportedly got up and moved
tables. Milo`s mom didn`t really know why,


82
0:6:11,4 --> 0:6:14,259
but the waiter heard the family that moved
to say this.


83
0:6:14,259 --> 0:6:15,12
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


84
0:6:15,12 --> 0:6:20,61
MICHAEL GARCIA, WAITER: Special needs children
need to be special somewhere else. That`s


85
0:6:20,61 --> 0:6:23,639
like saying you can`t come in here because
you have a different skin color.


86
0:6:23,639 --> 0:6:24,3
(END VIDEO CLIP)


87
0:6:24,3 --> 0:6:28,25
AZUZ: Saying goes that the customer is always
right, but Michael Garcia decided what he


88
0:6:28,25 --> 0:6:33,56
heard was wrong. He stood up for Milo and
refused to serve the other customers who walked


89
0:6:33,56 --> 0:6:38,56
out. And the owners backed up the waiter and
said Michael made the right call.


90
0:6:38,56 --> 0:6:43,3
These three guys are high school seniors,
Zick, Jesse and Drew. They were all up for


91
0:6:43,3 --> 0:6:49,479
homecoming king. Jesse, the guy in the middle,
won, except he didn`t. None of them did, because


92
0:6:49,479 --> 0:6:54,4
they al thought that Scotty, the student you
see here, should get the crown. Reporter Jamey


93
0:6:54,4 --> 0:6:57,669
Tucker with the CNN affiliate in Tennessee
tells you what happened.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Scott is loved by everyone
in school.


96
0:7:1,129 --> 0:7:3,84
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Scott will make a gloomy
day bright.


97
0:7:3,84 --> 0:7:6,94
JAMEY TUCKER, WHNT TV CORRESPONDENT: Scottie
Maloney, a high school junior, Community High


98
0:7:6,94 --> 0:7:12,11
in Unionville, born with William`s Syndrome,
a neurological disorder that inhibits speech


99
0:7:12,11 --> 0:7:16,68
and learning, but often, and in Scottie`s
case, makes people who have it, abundantly


100
0:7:16,68 --> 0:7:18,21
friendly and happy.


101
0:7:18,21 --> 0:7:22,96
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He`s a star of this school.
A lot of us look up to him.


102
0:7:22,96 --> 0:7:27,8
TUCKER: Seniors Zig Grissam (ph), Drew Gibbs
and Jesse Cooper were nominees for the school`s


103
0:7:27,8 --> 0:7:32,69
homecoming king. But before the votes were
counted, they came up with an unselfish idea.


104
0:7:32,69 --> 0:7:37,12
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He is always happy. So
he deserves some recognition for who he is.


105
0:7:37,12 --> 0:7:42,36
TUCKER: With the entire school and most of
the community watching Scottie was named homecoming


106
0:7:42,36 --> 0:7:42,65
king.


107
0:7:42,65 --> 0:7:45,849
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I`ve seen (inaudible) before,
but I didn`t think it could quite drop (ph)


108
0:7:45,849 --> 0:7:46,15
that much.


109
0:7:46,15 --> 0:7:51,699
TUCKER: And for the next 30 seconds, the crowd
gave Scottie a standing ovation.


110
0:7:51,699 --> 0:7:57,19
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It was a ton of emotion
just from everybody. I think I saw Scottie


111
0:7:57,19 --> 0:8:1,0
show a few tears, you know, Jesse was pretty
emotional. I mean we`re all emotional out


112
0:8:1,0 --> 0:8:1,569
there on the court.


113
0:8:1,569 --> 0:8:6,97
TUCKER (on camera): It means an awful lot
to you, brother.

0:8:6,97 --> 0:8:7,229
SCOTTIE MALONEY: Yes.


115
0:8:7,229 --> 0:8:11,979
TUCKER: Scottie hasn`t taken his medal from
around his neck, and may not, for a long time.


116
0:8:11,979 --> 0:8:17,19
Homecoming king is a high point in one senior
year, but really, who remembers after a few


117
0:8:17,19 --> 0:8:17,349
years.


118
0:8:17,349 --> 0:8:20,55
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I wouldn`t wear it to school
every day, I would put it on my shelf and


119
0:8:20,55 --> 0:8:25,199
say, I got that, thanks, everybody, for voting
for me. And him, he`s so passionate about


120
0:8:25,199 --> 0:8:25,31
it.


121
0:8:25,31 --> 0:8:27,93
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You know, every time we
get together, hey, you remember when Scottie


122
0:8:27,93 --> 0:8:32,13
won a homecoming king, and we always look
back and cherish that.

0:9:29,69 --> 0:9:34,35
you just have to crack the case. But in the
