###11 ROCCO CASTORO: There is a place in Russia where people
###13 have discovered the secret of living in perfect harmony.
###18 A place where the children run free, where the Earth provides
###22 everything you need, and where money is meaningless.
###28 Welcome to the Church of the Last Testament.
###33 This is Petropavlovka, a small settlement located deep within
###37 the Taiga Forest of Siberia, over 100 miles away from the
###40 nearest town.
###41 It looks like an elf village at, like, a putt-putt course.
###47 About 20 years ago a handful of disciples came here to
###50 worship and live with Vissarion, or "the teacher,"
###52 as he is commonly known.
###55 Today, Vissarion's Church of the Last Testament has over
###58 5,000 followers from all around the world.
###61 About 2,000 live here and in the surrounding areas.
###63 [SINGING IN RUSSIAN]
###65 
###75 ROCCO CASTORO: I came here in hopes of meeting the man
###77 himself, who hasn't granted an interview to the media in at
###79 least three years.
###81 
###85 VISSARION: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###87 
###99 ROCCO CASTORO: Two decades ago, that man was known as
###100 Sergey Anatolyevitch Torop, a 29-year-old patrol officer who
###104 suddenly had a revelation that his was the word of God.
###107 VISSARION: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###111 ROCCO CASTORO: Conveniently, this realization happened
###113 right around the time the Soviet Union, a
###115 self-proclaimed nation of atheists, began to crumble,
###117 and religion became an acceptable topic of
###119 discussion in Russia.
###121 He soon began writing the Last Testament, a 12-volume
###124 follow-up of sorts to the New Testament, which details the
###128 religion's major tenets and provides answers to some of
###130 life's most mundane questions, such as which brand of
###134 detergent you should use.
###136 Labeled a dangerous cult by some, it has been reported
###139 that Vissarion and his followers believe in aliens,
###142 think suicide is A-OK, and believe that the end of the
###145 world is imminent.
###148 There are rules here that I was warned about--
###149 no cussing, no tobacco, no alcohol, no meat.
###153 I believe it's all vegan.
###154 I've got to watch my mouth because I have a dirty mouth.
###158 And I like meat, I like drugs, sometimes.
###164 There's none of that here, so it's going be good to dry up.
###168 I was invited here by one of the church's more recent
###171 converts, a 24-year-old woman named Tamriko, who worked as a
###175 lawyer in Moscow before moving here three months ago.
###179 She now works the German House, a sort of guest house
###181 for the spiritually curious.
###183 Why don't you give me a little history of how you got here?
###187 TAMRIKO DGEBUADZE: When I first heard about the teacher,
###189 it was me like this kind of thing that-- wow.
###192 It was like, this is the only source of all information, of
###195 all answers, and this is a real teacher of the truth
###199 about the world.
###200 And so--
###201 ROCCO CASTORO: Something feels--
###201 TAMRIKO DGEBUADZE: And sometimes you need answers.
###202 You need, just, answers.
###203 ROCCO CASTORO: Answers, yeah.
###203 TAMRIKO DGEBUADZE: And somebody will explain you,
###205 like, everything.
###206 He will explain your life.
###207 Why are you doing this.
###208 Why you have some problems--
###210 problems with your health, problems with your life.
###213 For what purpose, actually, you are living.
###215 ROCCO CASTORO: I see.
###217 And one of the things that a lot of people have said is
###218 like, oh, it's a cult.
###220 You know?
###220 How do you feel about that?
###222 It has a bad connotation.
###223 TAMRIKO DGEBUADZE: Usually, I don't think
###224 anything about this.
###224 Do you know why?
###225 Because I think that if some people find that this person
###229 can help them, and they want to pray to
###232 this person, why not?
###233 ROCCO CASTORO: OK, yeah.
###234 TAMRIKO DGEBUADZE: Why not, it's very good.
###237 ROCCO CASTORO: Is there anything that you perhaps
###239 disagree with here, with--
###240 TAMRIKO DGEBUADZE: Here?
###241 ROCCO CASTORO: --the teaching.
###242 With teachings, you know?
###243 TAMRIKO DGEBUADZE: No, no, no, no.
###244 ROCCO CASTORO: OK.
###246 Disagreeing with Vissarion's teachings is rare, which
###249 became very apparent after meeting Tanya, a patron of the
###252 local girls school--
###253 a place where young ladies go to learn "the discipline," as
###256 she put it.
###258 Is part of the lesson plan set aside for
###260 study of the teacher?
###262 TANYA DENISOVA: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###263 
###287 ROCCO CASTORO: So, do you ever have strong girls that maybe
###292 resist, and they're not so with that line of thinking?
###295 TANYA DENISOVA: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###315 ROCCO CASTORO: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###316 TANYA DENISOVA: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###328 ROCCO CASTORO: As tempting as brainwashing my girlfriend
###330 into misogynistic slavery sounded, I had mountains to
###333 climb and deities to meet.
###335 I had been invited to celebrate the Holiday of Good
###337 Fruits at the Abode of Dawn, a small mountaintop community
###341 where Vissarion and his closest followers live.
###344 I stopped at the general store to get supplies for the hike.
###347 So I have the luxury, after a 40-hour trip, of eating a CCC
###351 pop, We just bought provisions for two days.
###354 This is kind of the treat before--
###356 I don't even know if I'm supposed to be
###358 eating this, to be honest.
###358 I don't know what Vissarion's stance is on
###360 candy and ice pops.
###361 But it's hot, so.
###362 
###365 Mmm.
###367 I climbed into a Soviet-era bread loaf and begin the bumpy
###369 drive up the hill.
###372 And we've got a good crew, just materialized here at the
###375 base of the mountain.
###376 Looks like we're about ready to go.
###378 My hiking companions had traveled from Germany,
###380 Slovenia, Sweden, and beyond, all in hopes of catching even
###384 a glimpse of the elusive Vissarion.
###386 MALE SPEAKER 1: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###387 
###393 ROCCO CASTORO: Along the way, I met Maciek, a university
###395 student from Poland.
###398 What did you come here seeking?
###399 
###412 ROCCO CASTORO: [LAUGH].
###413 We made it to what appeared to be a border crossing, and the
###416 attendant took down our details.
###418 MALE SPEAKER 2: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###421 ROCCO CASTORO: Yes.
###422 
###424 Our guide, Nina, led me to the place where I'd be staying for
###427 the next two nights--
###429 the home of a lovely Russian family who immediately offered
###432 me cold vegetable soup and bread.
###434 FEMALE SPEAKER 1: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###436 ROCCO CASTORO: Vissarion's serene gaze watched over us as
###438 we ate our blessed meal, spiritually charging us for
###441 the upcoming nighttime liturgy.
###443 We're going to go see what worship is like here.
###446 I feel like I'm kind of in a different world, to be honest.
###450 [SINGING IN RUSSIAN]
###456 ROCCO CASTORO: The pre-holiday liturgy didn't seem too
###458 different from a Christian Mass.
###460 But I would come to find out that things weren't that
###462 simple here.
###463 Still, all the followers had been very pleasant so far.
###466 Only a few seemed to have the crazy stare of a cult member.
###470 I ran into Maciek and asked him how he was settling in.
###473 So how have the accommodations been?
###475 MACIEJ RAFINSIC: What accommodations--
###477 very, very well.
###478 I met nice people.
###479 We had a nice conversation.
###481 And then they asked me, when did I accept the teacher and
###484 his teachings.
###487 And I said, well, I'm not really a follower.
###490 And then there was, like, a minute of silence--
###493 second of silence.
###494 And it felt uneasy.
###495 But they got over it.
###496 But I think they felt a little disappointed.
###499 ROCCO CASTORO: [CHUCKLE], OK.
###501 And are you--
###503 they have our passports.
###505 MACIEJ RAFINSIC: I know.
###506 ROCCO CASTORO: [INAUDIBLE].
###506 Are you a little concerned about that?
###508 MACIEJ RAFINSIC: I am.
###509 It's like, you know--
###512 yeah, so I don't want to be insulting, but you come to the
###515 place which is far away from anywhere in the world.
###517 You come to people who are known to be members of a cult,
###522 of a religious group of--
###525 
###530 ROCCO CASTORO: [LAUGH]
###531 MACIEJ RAFINSIC: --of some sort, now.
###532 Let's put it like this.
###533 And then they take your passport away
###535 straight when you--
###537 ROCCO CASTORO: And they were pretty--
###539 MACIEJ RAFINSIC: They are pretty persistent about that.
###540 ROCCO CASTORO: Yeah.
###542 Physically and spiritually exhausted from my long
###544 journey, I turned in for the night to rest up for the
###547 Holiday of Good Fruits and our first glimpse of Vissarion.
###550 
###554 MALE SPEAKER 3: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###556 
###576 ROCCO CASTORO: Today is August 18, which is the high holy day
###581 of the year-- the Holiday of Good Fruits, the Church of the
###584 Last Testament's most important holiday.
###587 Basically, it's their Easter.
###589 It was on this day in 1990 when Vissarion first realized
###592 his divine connection to God and established his church.
###595 It's the reason that thousands of Vissarionites from around
###598 the world have gathered here today.
###599 MALE SPEAKER 3: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###601 
###604 ROCCO CASTORO: We began our ritualistic procession up the
###606 mountain, a five-hour journey replete
###608 with ceremonial washing--
###610 that felt good--
###611 mood music, and supremely positive vibes.
###617 [SINGING IN RUSSIAN]
###618 ROCCO CASTORO: Looking back, I think it was supposed to serve
###620 as a sort of mental palate cleanser for what lay ahead.
###623 Up the mountain we go.
###625 
###627 Part of the reason I wanted to come here--
###630 the world seems to be in a pretty bad way right now.
###632 This seems to be an idyllic community, so maybe Vissarion
###636 has some answers for us on how we could
###639 better live our lives.
###641 Or maybe he's just got it right, and
###643 people should come here.
###644 
###651 They're actually pretty good musicians.
###653 
###656 Oh wow, beautiful.
###657 
###660 I found a little friend in this hole here, watching us.
###663 He looks very surprised, like us.
###666 Wide-eyed.
###668 
###669 Stopping again for another hymn.
###671 
###675 Something happened to me while I was walking up the mountain.
###678 Was I experiencing the initial stages of indoctrination?
###682 Everything looked so beautiful.
###684 And the people seemed so happy.
###688 I began to wish that I could be more like them.
###692 Slava, another in a long line of guides/minders, didn't want
###696 me to miss the site where the site where Vissarion literally
###698 left his mark on mother nature.
###700 SLAVA TKACHENKO: The teacher, when the first time on this
###703 mountain, take your hands on this stone.
###706 And after we turned the stone, we see this letter, it was the
###712 first letter of his name--
###715 Jesus.
###716 In Russia, kha, letter kha.
###720 You may see it.
###721 ROCCO CASTORO: Yeah, we should see.
###722 Is it OK for me to touch?
###726 SLAVA TKACHENKO: Russian kha.
###728 ROCCO CASTORO: Kha.
###730 SLAVA TKACHENKO: Christos.
###730 In English, Jesus.
###732 ROCCO CASTORO: Christos.
###733 It's there.
###734 [NERVOUS LAUGH]
###735 While the rest of the followers gathered around the
###737 stage where Vissarion would soon give his sermon, Slava
###741 took us to visit the monastery for young boys.
###743 A trampoline.
###744 [LAUGH]
###744 SLAVA TKACHENKO: For jumping.
###745 ROCCO CASTORO: I'll jump.
###746 [LAUGH]
###748 NINA: Andrei is the master of those boys.
###750 ROCCO CASTORO: Of all the boys.
###751 Why do you live here?
###752 Why did you come here?
###753 ANDREI ANATOLEVICH: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###754 
###775 ROCCO CASTORO: We sat down with 17-year-old Ivan, who,
###777 among other things, was learning the "masculine
###779 professions."
###780 IVAN KOZLOVSKY: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###781 
###786 ROCCO CASTORO: How long have you been
###787 living at the monastery?
###789 IVAN KOZLOVSKY: Two years.
###790 ROCCO CASTORO: Two years.
###791 And how do like it?
###793 IVAN KOZLOVSKY: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###795 ROCCO CASTORO: What's your favorite thing to
###796 do during the day?
###799 IVAN KOZLOVSKY: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###800 
###802 ROCCO CASTORO: Are you planning on
###803 starting a family soon?
###805 IVAN KOZLOVSKY: [LAUGHING].
###806 
###812 [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###814 [LAUGHTER]
###815 ROCCO CASTORO: Do you have in mind a,
###818 maybe, a potential wife?
###821 No?
###821 [LAUGH], OK.
###825 That's it.
###825 We'll stop there.
###827 [RUSSIAN].
###828 IVAN KOZLOVSKY: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###829 ROCCO CASTORO: [LAUGH]
###831 Beautiful.
###832 Wow, that's amazing.
###834 You can see they're clearing out this side over here.
###837 Perhaps to build more housing.
###840 Their numbers are continually growing.
###843 I see why people stay, though.
###845 It's very beautiful.
###847 People who are interested in joining the community and
###850 living here, is there anything that one must do to become
###854 part of the community?
###854 Or can you just come and live here?
###857 ANDREI ANATOLEVICH: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###858 
###868 ROCCO CASTORO: If I moved here, I'm an editor and a
###872 writer, so, I'd have to learn Russian.
###874 But perhaps I could help with that?
###876 NINA: [LAUGH], You will be welcome.
###878 ANDREI ANATOLEVICH: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###879 
###892 ROCCO CASTORO: Hmm, a place where negative characters
###894 don't exist.
###896 That sounded pretty good to me.
###898 Clean energy?
###899 Healthy living?
###900 Virgin brides?
###902 I started wondering if the Abode of Dawn could be that
###904 place for me.
###905 Here we go.
###906 I'm going to hurt myself.
###907 [LAUGHTER]
###909 
###912 ROCCO CASTORO: And then, finally, it was time for us to
###915 get our first glimpse of the teacher himself.
###918 [SINGING IN RUSSIAN]
###921 MALE SPEAKER 3: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN OVER LOUDSPEAKER]
###922 Any moment, now, Vissarion's going to descend from the
###925 stairs and address everyone here.
###927 And as you can see, everyone's eagerly anticipating it.
###930 I have not doubt in my mind that they believe he is God.
###933 And it's interesting and kind of scary, too, to see so many
###938 people have so much faith in one man, or god.
###945 MALE SPEAKER 3: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN OVER LOUDSPEAKER]
###946 
###950 [SINGING IN RUSSIAN]
###955 ROCCO CASTORO: We had traveled thousands of miles to the
###957 middle of nowhere in Siberia to see this man, Vissarion,
###961 address his congregation on what they call the Holiday of
###964 Good Fruits.
###965 It was sort of spooky.
###967 
###972 [WHISPERING]
###972 Vissarion's making his way down now, very slowly.
###977 Very Christ-like.
###978 [SINGING CONTINUES]
###992 ROCCO CASTORO: And just as Vissarion was about to share
###994 some infallible nuggets of wisdom--
###996 VISSARION: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###999 ROCCO CASTORO: --they made us turn off the camera.
###1000 
###1003 After giving a short sermon in hushed tones, Vissarion
###1007 blessed bread made by the community for the ensuing
###1009 feast and bid his followers farewell.
###1012 CONGREGATION: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###1014 
###1024 ROCCO CASTORO: So we just have finished the
###1027 sermon with the teacher.
###1029 And Nina's going to translate a little bit for
###1031 us of what was said.
###1033 NINA: I remember exactly his first phrase--
###1036 "I'm glad that you still survive." Because everybody
###1040 was laughing.
###1042 And then he spoke about that we, all of us, are pupils--
###1049 ROCCO CASTORO: Pupils, yeah.
###1050 NINA: --in the school of life.
###1053 ROCCO CASTORO: "We are all peoples in
###1054 the school of life"?
###1056 I guess that's true.
###1058 But I'm not sure it provided me with any answers.
###1060 We're going to see if we can interview some pilgrims.
###1064 Some people that came to see Vissarion from afar.
###1067 What is your feelings about Vissarion?
###1069 FEMALE SPEAKER 3: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###1070 
###1074 ROCCO CASTORO: Why did you make the journey here today?
###1076 MALE SPEAKER 4: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###1078 
###1085 ROCCO CASTORO: How did you first hear about the teacher?
###1087 MALE SPEAKER 5: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###1097 ROCCO CASTORO: Compared to years past,
###1099 does he seem happy?
###1100 Does he seem in good spirits?
###1101 MALE SPEAKER 6: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###1103 
###1117 ROCCO CASTORO: After the liturgy, we ran into our
###1119 Polish friend, Maciek.
###1120 ROCCO CASTORO: How do you feel?
###1121 I mean, do you feel that there's something about him
###1123 that's beyond human?
###1125 MACIEJ RAFINSIC: I don't want to insult anybody,
###1126 but I don't, no.
###1128 I feel it's an interesting place and
###1130 an interesting person.
###1131 And I think these people around me want
###1133 to live a good life.
###1136 And I do appreciate that.
###1137 But I don't perceive him as divine.
###1141 ROCCO CASTORO: After mingling with some members of the
###1143 congregation, I headed to bed to rest up for the next day
###1146 and my big interview with Vissarion.
###1148 There's a lot of stars tonight.
###1150 I was talking with Slava about the beautiful and clear
###1152 nighttime sky, when he told me that stars weren't the only
###1156 things up there.
###1158 ROCCO CASTORO: You've seen UFOs?
###1160 
###1163 ROCCO CASTORO: What did it look like?
###1164 
###1169 ROCCO CASTORO: Three spheres.
###1170 Yeah, OK.
###1173 ROCCO CASTORO: See it too?
###1174 
###1177 The next morning, we got up bright and early and took a
###1180 secret path to Vissarion's home.
###1182 So we're finally here at the teacher's house.
###1186 And we're going to interview a man that many people believe
###1188 to be the word of god.
###1191 I suddenly became very anxious about my
###1193 meeting with the teacher.
###1194 What if I actually had an audience with someone who is
###1197 the word, and perhaps flesh, of god?
###1201 [INAUDIBLE]
###1202 
###1205 Why did you agree to an interview with me?
###1207 Because I know that you haven't for quite a bit.
###1211 VISSARION: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###1214 ROCCO CASTORO: [LAUGH]
###1216 Are you regretting it now?
###1217 
###1220 OK.
###1221 I want to know about Russia.
###1224 Was it a coincidence, or was it just happenstance that this
###1228 community came to be around the same time as the fall of
###1233 the Soviet Union?
###1234 VISSARION: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###1235 
###1256 ROCCO CASTORO: I think I understood what he was saying.
###1258 But I was struggling with how to tactfully ask someone who
###1261 looks like Jesus if he's the Son of God without coming out
###1264 and saying it.
###1265 You're very Christ-like in your appearance.
###1268 I'll say it this way-- do you have memories of Christ from
###1273 2,000 years ago?
###1275 Do you carry on in that way, in that lineage?
###1278 VISSARION: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###1279 
###1307 ROCCO CASTORO: That's probably as close to a yes as I was
###1309 going to get.
###1311 It seems like the world is--
###1312 there's lots of riots.
###1313 There's uprisings.
###1314 Is the turmoil and conflict in the world right now worse than
###1319 you've experienced?
###1320 VISSARION: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###1322 
###1337 ROCCO CASTORO: Was Vissarion talking about Armageddon?
###1340 Naturally, I was curious as to when that might happen.
###1343 Is that coming soon?
###1345 VISSARION: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###1346 
###1355 ROCCO CASTORO: Talk about dancing around the subject.
###1357 I switched gears, and, remembering Slava's
###1360 extraterrestrial encounter, asked him about the church's
###1362 stance on what they call "the outer space mind."
###1366 VISSARION: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###1368 
###1391 ROCCO CASTORO: I have to admit, Vissarion lost me
###1393 somewhere in between the end times and soulless aliens.
###1396 Still, I could see how his followers could really get
###1398 into this stuff.
###1400 It's a hell of a lot more interesting than Adam and Eve
###1402 and the crucifixion.
###1404 The teacher's handlers signalled that it was
###1406 time to wrap up.
###1407 But I was determined to slip in a few simple questions
###1410 that, with any luck, would be answered in a
###1412 straightforward manner.
###1413 How about food.
###1414 What's your favorite dish to eat?
###1416 VISSARION: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###1418 
###1429 ROCCO CASTORO: A man without penchant--
###1430 which apparently extended to answering questions in a
###1433 fashion that I could understand.
###1435 But this was my last shot.
###1437 At the very least, maybe I could glean something about
###1439 the purity of my own being.
###1441 Just meeting me briefly, can you tell me
###1443 anything about myself?
###1445 VISSARION: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###1447 
###1454 ROCCO CASTORO: [LAUGH]
###1455 I'd say--
###1456 So last question.
###1457 If you could tell one piece of advice that our viewers here
###1462 could follow relatively easily, what would it be?
###1467 VISSARION: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###1468 
###1478 ROCCO CASTORO: OK.
###1480 I'm not sure if I was supposed to or not, but there is no way
###1483 I was leaving without a photo.
###1485 So I hopped right in there.
###1488 [RUSSIAN].
###1489 So we've finished our journey here, and going back to New
###1495 York City, and pollution, and terrible people.
###1498 In other words, all the things that I find weirdly
###1501 comforting.
###1502 What can I say?
###1504 I'm a man of modern convenience.
###1506 But if it ever gets too much for me, if the scum of
###1509 humanity becomes so sticky and viscous that I can't scrub it
###1512 off, I know there's a place where I can drop
###1515 out and be at peace.
###1517 And the next time someone complains to me that
###1518 everything sucks, or our problems are unsolvable, I'll
###1522 just tell them--
###1523 there's this place you can go in Siberia where they'll
###1527 accept you with open arms.
###1529 A place where the children run free, where the earth provides
###1533 everything you need.
###1534 And where money--
###1535 [SINGING IN RUSSIAN]
