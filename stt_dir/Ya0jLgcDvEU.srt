[MUSIC - EIGHT DAYZ, "WHAT'S
SO STRANGE ABOUT ME?"]


3
0:0:3,72 --> 0:0:19,266



4
0:0:19,266 --> 0:0:25,71



5
0:0:25,71 --> 0:0:28,33
PONTUS ALV: In the '70s, Malmo
was a big industrial city.


6
0:0:28,33 --> 0:0:31,8
And building big oil ships, like
big tankers, that was the


7
0:0:31,8 --> 0:0:33,37
main business.


8
0:0:33,37 --> 0:0:35,91
In the '80s, there was the
big financial crash.


9
0:0:35,91 --> 0:0:37,2
So there was no work,
there was no


10
0:0:37,2 --> 0:0:39,96
jobs, there was nothing.


11
0:0:39,96 --> 0:0:41,72
Malmo had quite a big
skate scene back


12
0:0:41,72 --> 0:0:43,2
then in the late '80s.


13
0:0:43,2 --> 0:0:46,76
That was when the big trend
came from the States.


14
0:0:46,76 --> 0:0:49,34
When my parents got divorced
and moved to another city,


15
0:0:49,34 --> 0:0:52,36
like a small village called
[INAUDIBLE], that's where I


16
0:0:52,36 --> 0:0:53,77
started skating.


17
0:0:53,77 --> 0:0:57,54
Basically, my dad picked me up
after school, drove me 45


18
0:0:57,54 --> 0:1:0,92
minutes to Malmo to go to the
skate park, go to the spot.


19
0:1:0,92 --> 0:1:3,2
He would sit there all day,
wait for me, watch


20
0:1:3,2 --> 0:1:4,8
me skate, go back.


21
0:1:4,8 --> 0:1:5,81
And we would do that every day,


22
0:1:5,81 --> 0:1:7,6
pretty much, after school.


23
0:1:7,6 --> 0:1:11,3



24
0:1:11,3 --> 0:1:12,95
I always try to skate
something different.


25
0:1:12,95 --> 0:1:14,72
I always try to make something
different,


26
0:1:14,72 --> 0:1:16,16
find something different.


27
0:1:16,16 --> 0:1:18,63
For me, it's like the atmosphere
around the spot is


28
0:1:18,63 --> 0:1:20,921
just as important as
the spot itself.


29
0:1:20,921 --> 0:1:24,358



30
0:1:24,358 --> 0:1:28,15
The first place we built
was Savanna Side.


31
0:1:28,15 --> 0:1:29,4
This is where it all started.


32
0:1:29,4 --> 0:1:32,64



33
0:1:32,64 --> 0:1:34,2
Well, it's right there.


34
0:1:34,2 --> 0:1:39,0
Used to be all empty here, just
old factory foundation.


35
0:1:39,0 --> 0:1:41,725



36
0:1:41,725 --> 0:1:45,32
When we built the park, we
didn't have any plan for it.


37
0:1:45,32 --> 0:1:48,2
Everything is just kind of made
up, just everybody got a


38
0:1:48,2 --> 0:1:49,27
little piece in here.


39
0:1:49,27 --> 0:1:52,665



40
0:1:52,665 --> 0:1:56,305
We use to skate the trains as
well sometimes, street gaps on


41
0:1:56,305 --> 0:1:57,555
top of the trains.


42
0:1:57,555 --> 0:2:4,82



43
0:2:4,82 --> 0:2:7,86
This here, we skated here every
day for two months,


44
0:2:7,86 --> 0:2:9,11
three months.


45
0:2:9,11 --> 0:2:11,6



46
0:2:11,6 --> 0:2:12,9
People are not so
into this place.


47
0:2:12,9 --> 0:2:14,92
Not many people come
here to skate.


48
0:2:14,92 --> 0:2:16,8
This is the New York banks.


49
0:2:16,8 --> 0:2:19,47
If you don't have it,
you got to build it.


50
0:2:19,47 --> 0:2:21,54
This is kind of like
the spot in London.


51
0:2:21,54 --> 0:2:23,72
I know Bobby Puleo has a couple
tricks, the nosegrind


52
0:2:23,72 --> 0:2:28,68
into these brick banks, kind
of like the same idea.


53
0:2:28,68 --> 0:2:30,99
I mean, if you want to have
something good to skate, you


54
0:2:30,99 --> 0:2:33,42
want to have something that is
interesting, fun, you've got


55
0:2:33,42 --> 0:2:33,85
to build it.


56
0:2:33,85 --> 0:2:35,82
I mean, you don't find these
kind of things on the streets.


57
0:2:35,82 --> 0:2:39,22
And here, I've got everything
I need in one small place.


58
0:2:39,22 --> 0:2:40,835
And it's perfect, you know.


59
0:2:40,835 --> 0:2:43,37



60
0:2:43,37 --> 0:2:44,13
We go skate.


61
0:2:44,13 --> 0:2:45,16
And I got the camera with me.


62
0:2:45,16 --> 0:2:46,64
And whatever happens happens.


63
0:2:46,64 --> 0:2:49,5
But we always end up having
some photos, some footage.


64
0:2:49,5 --> 0:2:50,793
And then we just do something
with it, you know.


65
0:2:50,793 --> 0:2:53,964



66
0:2:53,964 --> 0:2:56,2
NILS SVENSSON: You have to
be creative to find new


67
0:2:56,2 --> 0:2:57,22
stuff all the time.


68
0:2:57,22 --> 0:2:58,79
That's what's great
with Pontus.


69
0:2:58,79 --> 0:3:0,42
That's exactly what
he's looking for.


70
0:3:0,42 --> 0:3:3,9
And that's exactly what
I'm looking for.


71
0:3:3,9 --> 0:3:7,37
"Strongest of the Strange," it's
quite a slice of history


72
0:3:7,37 --> 0:3:9,61
from Malmo skating
right there.


73
0:3:9,61 --> 0:3:14,86
You could see the development
we've done with the DIY stuff.


74
0:3:14,86 --> 0:3:17,11
I think it was really inspiring
for a lot of people


75
0:3:17,11 --> 0:3:20,11
that you can really create
your own skate scene,


76
0:3:20,11 --> 0:3:24,3
basically, just by bricks
and concrete.


77
0:3:24,3 --> 0:3:25,34
PONTUS ALV: I think a lot
of people, it was really


78
0:3:25,34 --> 0:3:29,45
refreshing to see that video,
with the whole DIY documentary


79
0:3:29,45 --> 0:3:31,68
thing inspired a
lot of people.


80
0:3:31,68 --> 0:3:34,89
I got kids from all over Europe
sending me emails like,


81
0:3:34,89 --> 0:3:37,59
hey, I love that video,
I love what you did.


82
0:3:37,59 --> 0:3:39,4
And look what me and
my friends built.


83
0:3:39,4 --> 0:3:45,4



84
0:3:45,4 --> 0:3:47,61
There's so many bowls have been
built just because of


85
0:3:47,61 --> 0:3:48,86
that little section
in my video.


86
0:3:48,86 --> 0:3:55,41



87
0:3:55,41 --> 0:3:57,29
This is what remains.


88
0:3:57,29 --> 0:3:59,3
There's a lot of history
here in this place.


89
0:3:59,3 --> 0:4:2,5
It was quite famous when
it was up and running.


90
0:4:2,5 --> 0:4:5,39



91
0:4:5,39 --> 0:4:8,65
This place used to be fucking
homeless city.


92
0:4:8,65 --> 0:4:10,82
We talked to the landowner when
he kicked out all the


93
0:4:10,82 --> 0:4:11,86
homeless people here.


94
0:4:11,86 --> 0:4:13,19
They said, yeah, you
guys can stay.


95
0:4:13,19 --> 0:4:15,19
But we've got to clean
up the area.


96
0:4:15,19 --> 0:4:18,6
The homeless people here, they
were so angry at me.


97
0:4:18,6 --> 0:4:19,87
They're like, yeah man, we've
been living here for eight,


98
0:4:19,87 --> 0:4:20,49
nine years.


99
0:4:20,49 --> 0:4:21,55
And you guys get to stay.


100
0:4:21,55 --> 0:4:22,68
They kick us out.


101
0:4:22,68 --> 0:4:25,99
And yeah, they were throwing
fire bombs over the


102
0:4:25,99 --> 0:4:27,265
fence into the bowl.


103
0:4:27,265 --> 0:4:29,62
This bowl has got destroyed
a couple of times,


104
0:4:29,62 --> 0:4:30,22
and we fixed it.


105
0:4:30,22 --> 0:4:33,82
And one day came, someone
smashed it.


106
0:4:33,82 --> 0:4:36,21
The first you get bulldozed,
you get really bummed.


107
0:4:36,21 --> 0:4:38,48
But I'm so used to it now.


108
0:4:38,48 --> 0:4:40,475
In a way, it's good, because
you get new stuff to


109
0:4:40,475 --> 0:4:42,1
skate all the time.


110
0:4:42,1 --> 0:4:43,3
Tear it down, and build
another one.


111
0:4:43,3 --> 0:4:47,224
And tear it down, and build--
it's like a little war I got.


112
0:4:47,224 --> 0:4:50,8
If you have an idea, do
it, and do it now.


113
0:4:50,8 --> 0:4:52,76
This session today might
be the last one.


114
0:4:52,76 --> 0:4:55,42
It might be the last time
we skate here together.


115
0:4:55,42 --> 0:4:58,83
That brings something extra to
the spot, rather than just a


116
0:4:58,83 --> 0:5:1,15
public state park, that
it's there for you.


117
0:5:1,15 --> 0:5:13,62



118
0:5:13,62 --> 0:5:17,5
Back in the '90s, Malmo was
a ghost town, kind of


119
0:5:17,5 --> 0:5:19,7
like worn down city.


120
0:5:19,7 --> 0:5:21,705
Skating-wise, wasn't
anything going on.


121
0:5:21,705 --> 0:5:28,167
I mean, skateboarding in
the '90s was dead.


122
0:5:28,167 --> 0:5:30,632
We used to skate here
all the time.


123
0:5:30,632 --> 0:5:33,83
Then for some reason, they put
this for the people that go


124
0:5:33,83 --> 0:5:35,673
from the bus, so it's
not slippery.


125
0:5:35,673 --> 0:5:39,29
So they kind of fucked up the
spot, because this ledge was


126
0:5:39,29 --> 0:5:40,54
the main thing to skate.


127
0:5:40,54 --> 0:5:46,15



128
0:5:46,15 --> 0:5:46,97
MARTIN NILSSON: In the
'90s there was this


129
0:5:46,97 --> 0:5:48,23
square right there.


130
0:5:48,23 --> 0:5:50,1
We called it Plaza.


131
0:5:50,1 --> 0:5:50,68
We had ledges.


132
0:5:50,68 --> 0:5:52,21
We had this.


133
0:5:52,21 --> 0:5:53,7
We had some stairs.


134
0:5:53,7 --> 0:5:55,73
I mean, it wasn't perfect,
and nothing is.


135
0:5:55,73 --> 0:5:57,36
But it was our spot.


136
0:5:57,36 --> 0:5:59,53
And I wouldn't go as
far as saying it


137
0:5:59,53 --> 0:6:1,16
was American standard.


138
0:6:1,16 --> 0:6:3,75
But in our heads, we were
like, yeah, this is


139
0:6:3,75 --> 0:6:5,2
really a good spot.


140
0:6:5,2 --> 0:6:7,74



141
0:6:7,74 --> 0:6:11,3
When we started, we were
10 or 15 guys.


142
0:6:11,3 --> 0:6:12,38
Pontus was 11.


143
0:6:12,38 --> 0:6:16,54
And one guy was,
back then, 25.


144
0:6:16,54 --> 0:6:17,76
Everybody hated us.


145
0:6:17,76 --> 0:6:20,43
Story of most skaters'
lives in the '90s.


146
0:6:20,43 --> 0:6:21,68
-Yes.


147
0:6:21,68 --> 0:6:23,93



148
0:6:23,93 --> 0:6:26,42
MARTIN OTTOSSON: This was
in the early '80s.


149
0:6:26,42 --> 0:6:28,29
There was a Swedish band
called Magnum Bonum.


150
0:6:28,29 --> 0:6:32,9



151
0:6:32,9 --> 0:6:35,27
They made a hit song called
"Skateboard." I used to listen


152
0:6:35,27 --> 0:6:38,88
to it every day when I was
playing on my swing.


153
0:6:38,88 --> 0:6:41,53
I moved here in '95.


154
0:6:41,53 --> 0:6:44,8
The official reason
was for studies.


155
0:6:44,8 --> 0:6:47,29
But I wanted to go here because
of skateboarding.


156
0:6:47,29 --> 0:6:49,33
It was only one group
of people.


157
0:6:49,33 --> 0:6:50,42
It was us.


158
0:6:50,42 --> 0:6:55,44
We didn't have anybody else to
look up to or learn from.


159
0:6:55,44 --> 0:6:57,48
MARTIN NILSSON: We probably
spent skating


160
0:6:57,48 --> 0:6:58,95
three hours every day.


161
0:6:58,95 --> 0:7:3,31
When it was raining or too cold,
we could just go down,


162
0:7:3,31 --> 0:7:6,48
because under here is
a parking garage.


163
0:7:6,48 --> 0:7:11,1



164
0:7:11,1 --> 0:7:13,78
When the shopping mall is
closed, we could skate up


165
0:7:13,78 --> 0:7:17,132
here, the luxury part
of the garage.


166
0:7:17,132 --> 0:7:20,36
And most of the time, we used
to just skate down there,


167
0:7:20,36 --> 0:7:24,13
because otherwise we
got kicked out.


168
0:7:24,13 --> 0:7:25,25
TOBIAS HENRIKSSON:
We came down here


169
0:7:25,25 --> 0:7:28,33
first time maybe '91.


170
0:7:28,33 --> 0:7:30,34
We used to skate here a
lot, every day from 7


171
0:7:30,34 --> 0:7:32,46
o'clock 'til 9:00.


172
0:7:32,46 --> 0:7:35,27
There are some other garages,
but not as good as this.


173
0:7:35,27 --> 0:7:38,455
This is warm and perfect
flat ground and curbs.


174
0:7:38,455 --> 0:7:39,9
Perfect to do manuals
and stuff here.


175
0:7:39,9 --> 0:7:43,33



176
0:7:43,33 --> 0:7:44,8
That's the way it
was back then.


177
0:7:44,8 --> 0:7:46,64
We never turned the
camera off.


178
0:7:46,64 --> 0:7:49,15
One guy missed, the next guy
would jump in, do the line.


179
0:7:49,15 --> 0:7:53,6



180
0:7:53,6 --> 0:7:56,49
Pontus, he's five years younger
than the rest of us.


181
0:7:56,49 --> 0:8:0,33
I remember when he took off
in '94, maybe, when he was


182
0:8:0,33 --> 0:8:2,21
getting really good.


183
0:8:2,21 --> 0:8:5,26
It was cool when he went to San
Francisco and skated for


184
0:8:5,26 --> 0:8:7,42
Mad Circle, because Mad Circle
was so big at that time.


185
0:8:7,42 --> 0:8:9,39
-Were you guys pretty
proud of him?


186
0:8:9,39 --> 0:8:10,29
TOBIAS HENRIKSSON:
Yes, we were.


187
0:8:10,29 --> 0:8:11,54
Still are.


188
0:8:11,54 --> 0:8:16,33



189
0:8:16,33 --> 0:8:20,2
PONTUS ALV: [INAUDIBLE], and
he's the one who started up


190
0:8:20,2 --> 0:8:21,545
Mad Circle with Justin.


191
0:8:21,545 --> 0:8:23,73
I met him at the skate
park in Gothenburg.


192
0:8:23,73 --> 0:8:24,9
And he saw me skate.


193
0:8:24,9 --> 0:8:27,19
And he was really stoked.


194
0:8:27,19 --> 0:8:29,86
Basically, yeah, he got a
camera from [INAUDIBLE].


195
0:8:29,86 --> 0:8:31,24
He came down one day.


196
0:8:31,24 --> 0:8:32,35
And I'm going to film you.


197
0:8:32,35 --> 0:8:34,95
And I was like, OK, cool.


198
0:8:34,95 --> 0:8:36,679
Because I was thinking
you have to make


199
0:8:36,679 --> 0:8:37,539
everything first try.


200
0:8:37,539 --> 0:8:42,97
So I got, like, I don't know, 15
lines first try, like bam.


201
0:8:42,97 --> 0:8:45,1
And then he sent the
tape to the States.


202
0:8:45,1 --> 0:8:47,3
Justin saw it, and he's
like, this is it.


203
0:8:47,3 --> 0:8:49,26
Him and Blabec came
over, we skated.


204
0:8:49,26 --> 0:8:51,71
And then they said, yeah, I'll
fly you out to San Francisco,


205
0:8:51,71 --> 0:8:53,765
and it was on.


206
0:8:53,765 --> 0:8:55,41
I was, like, 15.


207
0:8:55,41 --> 0:8:58,3
My mom said, you got
to bring a friend.


208
0:8:58,3 --> 0:9:0,3
So I brought one of
my friends over.


209
0:9:0,3 --> 0:9:1,18
Justin picked us up.


210
0:9:1,18 --> 0:9:2,613
And we lost our luggage.


211
0:9:2,613 --> 0:9:5,67
Me and Scott Johnson didn't
really get along that well.


212
0:9:5,67 --> 0:9:7,87
But me and Bobby were tight.


213
0:9:7,87 --> 0:9:10,995
Coming from this little town,
just straight to fucking your


214
0:9:10,995 --> 0:9:14,88
dream company, like from nothing
down here to going


215
0:9:14,88 --> 0:9:17,33
straight into the heart
of San Francisco.


216
0:9:17,33 --> 0:9:22,698



217
0:9:22,698 --> 0:9:23,8
This is the church.


218
0:9:23,8 --> 0:9:25,985
It's called Johannes Church.


219
0:9:25,985 --> 0:9:29,87
This is where I had a line in
the "5 Flavors," opening


220
0:9:29,87 --> 0:9:32,52
switch 180 up, and
backs a flip out.


221
0:9:32,52 --> 0:9:35,29
This was the main
meet up spot.


222
0:9:35,29 --> 0:9:38,666
Back in those days, all you
needed, like, flat curb and


223
0:9:38,666 --> 0:9:39,916
wax it up, and [SWISH].


224
0:9:39,916 --> 0:9:42,925



225
0:9:42,925 --> 0:9:44,77
JOHN DAHLQUIST: We spent
a lot of time here.


226
0:9:44,77 --> 0:9:48,92
Pretty much one full summer
in '93, we'd meet up


227
0:9:48,92 --> 0:9:51,61
here, skate all day.


228
0:9:51,61 --> 0:9:54,52
Road trip would be to go down
to that parking lot.


229
0:9:54,52 --> 0:10:1,54



230
0:10:1,54 --> 0:10:4,29
PONTUS ALV: This parking lot
used to be covered with these


231
0:10:4,29 --> 0:10:5,422
white ledges.


232
0:10:5,422 --> 0:10:7,57
We used to skate here a lot.


233
0:10:7,57 --> 0:10:8,82
This is for the good old days.


234
0:10:8,82 --> 0:10:18,56



235
0:10:18,56 --> 0:10:23,1
In my second video, I had 50-50,
and then transfer to


236
0:10:23,1 --> 0:10:24,35
the other side.


237
0:10:24,35 --> 0:10:27,4



238
0:10:27,4 --> 0:10:29,215
Mad Circle ended.


239
0:10:29,215 --> 0:10:31,49
I got back to Europe, I wanted
to quit skating.


240
0:10:31,49 --> 0:10:33,91
But then I just started to skate
again with friends and


241
0:10:33,91 --> 0:10:38,6
got into it, and just called up
Jeremy and said, I want to


242
0:10:38,6 --> 0:10:40,435
work with Cliche, and want to
build something up in Europe.


243
0:10:40,435 --> 0:10:43,355
And me and Jeremy started
working on the whole Cliche


244
0:10:43,355 --> 0:10:44,605
Europa project.


245
0:10:44,605 --> 0:10:48,22



246
0:10:48,22 --> 0:10:50,83
It seems like since I left the
industry, things have just


247
0:10:50,83 --> 0:10:52,52
been going so much better.


248
0:10:52,52 --> 0:10:54,62
The more you're away from
skateboarding, the


249
0:10:54,62 --> 0:10:55,74
more people want you.


250
0:10:55,74 --> 0:10:57,25
Now it's like, oh, we
want an interview.


251
0:10:57,25 --> 0:10:58,0
We want photos.


252
0:10:58,0 --> 0:10:59,13
We want to publish your stuff.


253
0:10:59,13 --> 0:11:1,49
When I was in the States,
when I was with


254
0:11:1,49 --> 0:11:3,1
Cliche, you try so hard.


255
0:11:3,1 --> 0:11:5,99
And then it's like you're just
another guy doing it.


256
0:11:5,99 --> 0:11:7,707
People always want something
they can't get.


257
0:11:7,707 --> 0:11:21,83



258
0:11:21,83 --> 0:11:23,291
-Do you like it?


259
0:11:23,291 --> 0:11:26,213
PONTUS ALV: It's all right.


260
0:11:26,213 --> 0:11:27,125
-Let me see.


261
0:11:27,125 --> 0:11:27,52
Let me see it.


262
0:11:27,52 --> 0:11:28,294
PONTUS ALV: Hello.


263
0:11:28,294 --> 0:11:29,262
-Go ahead.


264
0:11:29,262 --> 0:11:30,23
PONTUS ALV: Hello.


265
0:11:30,23 --> 0:11:31,198
-Yeah, that's good.


266
0:11:31,198 --> 0:11:32,448
PONTUS ALV: That's good?


267
0:11:32,448 --> 0:11:40,878



268
0:11:40,878 --> 0:11:42,43
JEREMY BUTTERWORTH: Get,
go, come here.


269
0:11:42,43 --> 0:11:43,68
That's right.


270
0:11:43,68 --> 0:11:46,23



271
0:11:46,23 --> 0:11:49,32
Not quite used to all this
hype around here.


272
0:11:49,32 --> 0:11:51,74
Cameras on, it's like,
oh, how's my hair?


273
0:11:51,74 --> 0:11:54,28



274
0:11:54,28 --> 0:11:55,8
My name's Jeremy Butterworth.


275
0:11:55,8 --> 0:11:57,93
I'm from Australia originally.


276
0:11:57,93 --> 0:12:2,41
I first came to Malmo in 2005.


277
0:12:2,41 --> 0:12:6,17
I had to help work on the
Stapelbadd project.


278
0:12:6,17 --> 0:12:8,77
This one's being built here in
Oxie because I think it's kind


279
0:12:8,77 --> 0:12:11,74
of a rough neighborhood, so
they need something to do.


280
0:12:11,74 --> 0:12:14,39
And it's just another good
excuse to get Malmo another


281
0:12:14,39 --> 0:12:14,95
skate park.


282
0:12:14,95 --> 0:12:17,7
It's only 20 minutes away.


283
0:12:17,7 --> 0:12:20,14
DAVID TOMS: I didn't really even
know where Malmo was when


284
0:12:20,14 --> 0:12:21,43
I first got my job.


285
0:12:21,43 --> 0:12:23,66
Just turned up here and
was blown away by the


286
0:12:23,66 --> 0:12:28,2
skateboarding that I saw and the
DIY feel that was going on


287
0:12:28,2 --> 0:12:31,22
here with Pontus building
spots everywhere.


288
0:12:31,22 --> 0:12:33,81
The government really, really
encouraging of the scene.


289
0:12:33,81 --> 0:12:37,78
They're just a really positive
towards the building of parks


290
0:12:37,78 --> 0:12:38,985
and the acquisition
of money for the


291
0:12:38,985 --> 0:12:41,15
skaters to build parks.


292
0:12:41,15 --> 0:12:43,24
JEREMY BUTTERWORTH: We just
came out here with a few


293
0:12:43,24 --> 0:12:43,91
things in mind.


294
0:12:43,91 --> 0:12:46,28
And after years of experience
in building parks, we can


295
0:12:46,28 --> 0:12:47,93
really plan and [INAUDIBLE].


296
0:12:47,93 --> 0:12:48,55
It's a lot of fun.


297
0:12:48,55 --> 0:12:50,24
And you get to be more creative,
where you just come


298
0:12:50,24 --> 0:12:52,53
out with a spray paint can,
and just X on the ground.


299
0:12:52,53 --> 0:12:54,67
All right, we're
starting here.


300
0:12:54,67 --> 0:12:56,293
There's always more to add on
to some of the parks we've


301
0:12:56,293 --> 0:12:56,81
build before.


302
0:12:56,81 --> 0:12:58,58
So we're just going
to keep on going.


303
0:12:58,58 --> 0:13:0,39
And we're never going to stop.


304
0:13:0,39 --> 0:13:3,29
-Do you have a favorite
skate park here?


305
0:13:3,29 --> 0:13:5,218
DAVID TOMS: I'd have
to say Stapel.


306
0:13:5,218 --> 0:13:7,9
-Who rips that place
the hardest?


307
0:13:7,9 --> 0:13:8,8
DAVID TOMS: Jeremy.


308
0:13:8,8 --> 0:13:9,33
He's the man.


309
0:13:9,33 --> 0:13:13,8



310
0:13:13,8 --> 0:13:16,32
JOHN MAGNUSSON: This park was
started being planned 2001 and


311
0:13:16,32 --> 0:13:19,49
was finished end of 2005.


312
0:13:19,49 --> 0:13:22,81
One of the main goals for this
skate park was to make people


313
0:13:22,81 --> 0:13:26,3
want to come here and explore
what we have, to make it grow


314
0:13:26,3 --> 0:13:28,37
and make more people part
of the skate scene.


315
0:13:28,37 --> 0:13:35,92



316
0:13:35,92 --> 0:13:39,49
I moved to Malmo in 1998, mostly
because of skating,


317
0:13:39,49 --> 0:13:42,49
because the big indoor
park just opened up.


318
0:13:42,49 --> 0:13:46,44
The scene in Malmo in 1998 was
far away from where it is now.


319
0:13:46,44 --> 0:13:49,3
There was this crew with
Tobias, Nils, Pontus,


320
0:13:49,3 --> 0:13:52,59
[INAUDIBLE], John, really
tight crew of 20 people.


321
0:13:52,59 --> 0:13:57,77
And they were kind of the guys
behind the indoor park also.


322
0:13:57,77 --> 0:14:0,67
Three years after I moved down
to Malmo, we kind of started


323
0:14:0,67 --> 0:14:3,58
to think together, the idea to
create something like the


324
0:14:3,58 --> 0:14:6,19
indoor park but outside.


325
0:14:6,19 --> 0:14:8,8
It's built and designed
by an American guy


326
0:14:8,8 --> 0:14:10,51
called Stefan Hauser.


327
0:14:10,51 --> 0:14:12,29
We've been working a lot with
skate parks ourself.


328
0:14:12,29 --> 0:14:14,11
But this was kind of
knew, the concrete.


329
0:14:14,11 --> 0:14:17,5
So we brought in someone that
we believed and help us out.


330
0:14:17,5 --> 0:14:20,2



331
0:14:20,2 --> 0:14:23,12
We want to have a little bit
inspiration from Burnside and


332
0:14:23,12 --> 0:14:24,62
Santa Rosa.


333
0:14:24,62 --> 0:14:26,82
At the moment, these concrete
parks in the States were


334
0:14:26,82 --> 0:14:27,93
looking a lot of vertical.


335
0:14:27,93 --> 0:14:29,62
So we said, don't build
everything vertical.


336
0:14:29,62 --> 0:14:31,82
Trying to keep it a little
bit lower, make it


337
0:14:31,82 --> 0:14:33,7
epic, a lot of flow.


338
0:14:33,7 --> 0:14:35,31



339
0:14:35,31 --> 0:14:37,8
My favorite part of the
park is everything.


340
0:14:37,8 --> 0:14:40,27
And you can just skate it for
two hours, and you don't have


341
0:14:40,27 --> 0:14:42,42
to do one single trick.


342
0:14:42,42 --> 0:14:46,8
Check it out, my son's skating
it at the moment.

skateboard organization called


348
0:14:59,31 --> 0:14:59,85
Bryggeriet.


349
0:14:59,85 --> 0:15:2,34
And we take care of
the outdoor parks,


350
0:15:2,34 --> 0:15:5,93
Stapelbaddsparken and the
smaller Sibbarp Skatepark, and


351
0:15:5,93 --> 0:15:8,171
the new one now.


352
0:15:8,171 --> 0:15:10,2
The city pays us to
take care of it.


353
0:15:10,2 --> 0:15:12,49
And we have a really good
cooperation with the city.


354
0:15:12,49 --> 0:15:14,5
We had a lot of big events
here, like Quicksilver


355
0:15:14,5 --> 0:15:17,88
Bowlriders and Malmo Ultra Bowl
and stuff, so that we do


356
0:15:17,88 --> 0:15:19,13
it together with them.

NILS SVENSSON: How it's changed
here in Malmo, it's


359
0:15:27,73 --> 0:15:28,81
hard to understand, really.


360
0:15:28,81 --> 0:15:33,242
But the city is so into
what we're doing.


361
0:15:33,242 --> 0:15:36,97
They have had so much positive
feedback that they just see it


362
0:15:36,97 --> 0:15:40,921
as such a good way of
marketing Malmo.


363
0:15:40,921 --> 0:15:45,85
And now when they design parks
and plazas and stuff, now they


364
0:15:45,85 --> 0:15:48,23
think, yeah, of course we should
include skateboarding.


365
0:15:48,23 --> 0:15:50,22
And it's worth a lot
for them, I think.

0:16:15,1 --> 0:16:18,39
part of Bryggeriets Gymnasium,
the high school


371
0:16:18,39 --> 0:16:21,4
for skating in Malmo.


372
0:16:21,4 --> 0:16:24,24
Right now, we have
142 students.


373
0:16:24,24 --> 0:16:30,19
And it's three years,
16 to 18.


374
0:16:30,19 --> 0:16:33,89
During school hours, it's
just students here.

And then the park
opens at 4:00.


376
0:16:35,83 --> 0:16:37,71
They do a lot of skating.


377
0:16:37,71 --> 0:16:40,95
And they skate from 9:00 in the
morning until they close


378
0:16:40,95 --> 0:16:44,2
here at 9:00 at night.


379
0:16:44,2 --> 0:16:46,51
At the beginning of first year,
we have something that


380
0:16:46,51 --> 0:16:48,52
we call basic training.


381
0:16:48,52 --> 0:16:52,5
But it shows pretty fast that
what's basic to one person is


382
0:16:52,5 --> 0:16:54,19
not to another.

to pro, pretty much.

400
0:17:36,195 --> 0:17:38,78



401
0:17:38,78 --> 0:17:41,43
-What's your favorite class,
your favorite lesson?


402
0:17:41,43 --> 0:17:44,762
FERNANDO BRAMSMARK: I think it's
skate, the skate lesson.


403
0:17:44,762 --> 0:17:48,21



404
0:17:48,21 --> 0:17:50,12
JOHN DAHLQUIST: There is two
street courses in the vert


405
0:17:50,12 --> 0:17:52,9
ramp and the bowl.


406
0:17:52,9 --> 0:17:55,41
They're served these great
state parks and great


407
0:17:55,41 --> 0:17:57,4
opportunities.


408
0:17:57,4 --> 0:17:59,94
I guess some of them think,
why would you want to go


409
0:17:59,94 --> 0:18:0,57
street skate?


410
0:18:0,57 --> 0:18:4,12
There's cracks in the streets
and ledges that aren't made


411
0:18:4,12 --> 0:18:5,37
from steel.


412
0:18:5,37 --> 0:18:9,2



413
0:18:9,2 --> 0:18:11,18
Actually, I have to
sometimes yell at


414
0:18:11,18 --> 0:18:13,12
people for not skating.


415
0:18:13,12 --> 0:18:15,48
But I would never set
any rules to how


416
0:18:15,48 --> 0:18:16,76
anyone should skate.


417
0:18:16,76 --> 0:18:20,71
There's never a moment of
everyone having to do 10


418
0:18:20,71 --> 0:18:21,89
kickflips, or anything
like that.


419
0:18:21,89 --> 0:18:26,87
Skateboarding has to be free,
and never set any rules to how


420
0:18:26,87 --> 0:18:28,12
someone's going to skate.


421
0:18:28,12 --> 0:18:36,74

0:18:36,74 --> 0:18:42,3
-[SPEAKING SWEDISH]


423
0:18:42,3 --> 0:18:44,78
LOVE ENEROTH: It's kind of
unpopular, this spot.


424
0:18:44,78 --> 0:18:47,925
If I propose that we go here to
someone, they're like, uh,


425
0:18:47,925 --> 0:18:50,715
let's go somewhere else.


426
0:18:50,715 --> 0:18:52,265
There used to be water.


427
0:18:52,265 --> 0:18:55,2
And I don't know why there's
no water here now.


428
0:18:55,2 --> 0:19:12,33



429
0:19:12,33 --> 0:19:15,82
LOVE ENEROTH: My name is Love
Enertoth, co-founder of


430
0:19:15,82 --> 0:19:17,4
Bellows Skateboards.


431
0:19:17,4 --> 0:19:23,615
And I do the creative
graphics and stuff.


432
0:19:23,615 --> 0:19:29,82
I moved here, like, '97 to
just pursue skating.


433
0:19:29,82 --> 0:19:33,19
At that time, there wasn't
really any skate companies.


434
0:19:33,19 --> 0:19:36,155
There was more like shops,
like G-Spot, for example.


435
0:19:36,155 --> 0:19:39,13



436
0:19:39,13 --> 0:19:43,7
Seven years ago, probably, I
went to Barcelona and sort of


437
0:19:43,7 --> 0:19:45,88
stayed there, and went
to France, too.


438
0:19:45,88 --> 0:19:48,87
And I was riding for Antiz.


439
0:19:48,87 --> 0:19:50,283
-Was it tough leaving Antiz?


440
0:19:50,283 --> 0:19:53,32
Or were you over it?


441
0:19:53,32 --> 0:19:55,63
LOVE ENEROTH: Yeah, was tough,
because I was kind of getting


442
0:19:55,63 --> 0:19:59,39
frustrated, not at them
but at my situation.


443
0:19:59,39 --> 0:20:0,92
I didn't just want
to skateboard.


444
0:20:0,92 --> 0:20:2,597
I wanted to do something
creative.


445
0:20:2,597 --> 0:20:6,98



446
0:20:6,98 --> 0:20:10,6
-Bellows is like a second
generation European company.


447
0:20:10,6 --> 0:20:11,766
Or even third, right?


448
0:20:11,766 --> 0:20:12,212
You know--


449
0:20:12,212 --> 0:20:13,955
LOVE ENEROTH: The Cliche.


450
0:20:13,955 --> 0:20:15,82
-They were the first,
and then Antiz.


451
0:20:15,82 --> 0:20:17,79
And then now it's
like people--


452
0:20:17,79 --> 0:20:19,4
LOVE ENEROTH: Now it's
a lot of companies.


453
0:20:19,4 --> 0:20:22,6



454
0:20:22,6 --> 0:20:23,9
We started out as a team.


455
0:20:23,9 --> 0:20:28,655
It was actually me, Martin, and
Johan Florell, a friend of


456
0:20:28,655 --> 0:20:32,71
ours who actually passed
away recently.


457
0:20:32,71 --> 0:20:36,2
But it was us who started it
together, and with Mika.


458
0:20:36,2 --> 0:20:40,59



459
0:20:40,59 --> 0:20:43,2
We just brainstormed how
do we want a skateboard


460
0:20:43,2 --> 0:20:44,56
company to feel like.


461
0:20:44,56 --> 0:20:46,832
And so we came up with this.


462
0:20:46,832 --> 0:20:50,45



463
0:20:50,45 --> 0:20:52,23
You shake your head
really fast.


464
0:20:52,23 --> 0:20:55,11
And then the flash will
freeze your face.


465
0:20:55,11 --> 0:20:56,55
So we thought that it
would be funny to


466
0:20:56,55 --> 0:21:0,34
do a series of portraits.


467
0:21:0,34 --> 0:21:2,3
I think Mika had the
fever that day.


468
0:21:2,3 --> 0:21:5,85
He couldn't shake his head,
so he was just blowing


469
0:21:5,85 --> 0:21:7,185
air out of his lips.


470
0:21:7,185 --> 0:21:10,85



471
0:21:10,85 --> 0:21:15,85
The best skating here is, I
guess, the summer months from


472
0:21:15,85 --> 0:21:20,279
probably May until the end of
September, like early October.


473
0:21:20,279 --> 0:21:23,59



474
0:21:23,59 --> 0:21:26,22
A lot of the spots
is in the summer.


475
0:21:26,22 --> 0:21:28,45
So there's a few in
the downtown area,


476
0:21:28,45 --> 0:21:29,87
but not that much.


477
0:21:29,87 --> 0:21:38,126
So you've got to go on the
train for 20 minutes.


478
0:21:38,126 --> 0:22:0,587
[SPEAKING SWEDISH]


479
0:22:0,587 --> 0:22:3,1
LOVE ENEROTH: This is a
suburb of Stockholm.


480
0:22:3,1 --> 0:22:7,29
And this is the backside of
where we're going to skate.


481
0:22:7,29 --> 0:22:9,6
And I don't what this is.


482
0:22:9,6 --> 0:22:12,205
Little kids just put
some shit here.


483
0:22:12,205 --> 0:22:23,64



484
0:22:23,64 --> 0:22:25,99
SARAH MEURLE: My name
is Sarah Meurle.


485
0:22:25,99 --> 0:22:31,39
We're skating with my teammates
from Bellows and a


486
0:22:31,39 --> 0:22:32,64
friend of ours called
Friedrich.


487
0:22:32,64 --> 0:22:35,788



488
0:22:35,788 --> 0:22:38,485
I came here at the beginning of
the summer, and I was out


489
0:22:38,485 --> 0:22:40,66
skating with Mika every day.


490
0:22:40,66 --> 0:22:41,91
He doesn't stop.


491
0:22:41,91 --> 0:22:48,77



492
0:22:48,77 --> 0:22:50,42
LOVE ENEROTH: We got
Sarah on the team.


493
0:22:50,42 --> 0:22:53,48
She's like the first one who's
not from Stockholm.


494
0:22:53,48 --> 0:22:56,33



495
0:22:56,33 --> 0:22:58,18
Her board is coming
out, actually.


496
0:22:58,18 --> 0:22:59,8
SARAH MEURLE: It's
going to be a--


497
0:22:59,8 --> 0:23:0,8
LOVE ENEROTH: A sunflower.


498
0:23:0,8 --> 0:23:4,69
SARAH MEURLE: --a sunflower
that Love had drawn.


499
0:23:4,69 --> 0:23:9,455
I went to school and all
the boys were skating.


500
0:23:9,455 --> 0:23:12,425
And I thought it seemed
really fun.


501
0:23:12,425 --> 0:23:15,184
And I just kept on skating
with the other boys.


502
0:23:15,184 --> 0:23:17,81



503
0:23:17,81 --> 0:23:20,84
If you go to my house,
it's on a dirt road.


504
0:23:20,84 --> 0:23:23,3
And there's nothing
at all to skate.


505
0:23:23,3 --> 0:23:27,95
So in the attic, me and my dad
built a little quarter pipe


506
0:23:27,95 --> 0:23:31,5
just next to my room, a small
little bank on the other side


507
0:23:31,5 --> 0:23:34,74
so you could kind of
go back and forth.


508
0:23:34,74 --> 0:23:38,722
I got sponsored by Streetlab,
the skate shop in Malmo.


509
0:23:38,722 --> 0:23:40,75
But I was small.


510
0:23:40,75 --> 0:23:42,26
But it was really fun.


511
0:23:42,26 --> 0:23:45,11
And I skated for them for
a couple of years.


512
0:23:45,11 --> 0:23:46,856
And then I started to
get other sponsors.


513
0:23:46,856 --> 0:23:51,78



514
0:23:51,78 --> 0:23:54,36
The first time I was on
an airplane was 2


515
0:23:54,36 --> 0:23:55,41
and 1/2 years ago.


516
0:23:55,41 --> 0:23:59,32
And since then, I've been
to so many places.


517
0:23:59,32 --> 0:24:0,7
-All because of skating?


518
0:24:0,7 --> 0:24:1,918
SARAH MEURLE: Yeah,
pretty much.


519
0:24:1,918 --> 0:24:3,834
-That's a pretty good deal.


520
0:24:3,834 --> 0:24:5,84
SARAH MEURLE: Yeah.


521
0:24:5,84 --> 0:24:9,59



522
0:24:9,59 --> 0:24:10,85
GREGER HAGELIN: I think
it's Friday afternoon.


523
0:24:10,85 --> 0:24:12,99
It's like people
are still here.


524
0:24:12,99 --> 0:24:15,16
Yeah, hey, bro, [INAUDIBLE].


525
0:24:15,16 --> 0:24:15,92
-[INAUDIBLE].


526
0:24:15,92 --> 0:24:17,41
GREGER HAGELIN: [INAUDIBLE]


527
0:24:17,41 --> 0:24:20,17
was one of the guys
that we met back


528
0:24:20,17 --> 0:24:21,695
in the days in G-Spot.


529
0:24:21,695 --> 0:24:23,923
He was a great skateboarder
back then.


530
0:24:23,923 --> 0:24:24,75
-Still am.


531
0:24:24,75 --> 0:24:25,96
GREGER HAGELIN: Still
am, yeah.


532
0:24:25,96 --> 0:24:28,98
So we met back in the day.


533
0:24:28,98 --> 0:24:31,16
So now he works here.


534
0:24:31,16 --> 0:24:33,45
There's a lot of old
skateboarders working here, or


535
0:24:33,45 --> 0:24:34,7
young skateboarder, whatever
you want to say.


536
0:24:34,7 --> 0:24:38,13



537
0:24:38,13 --> 0:24:39,85
Down here, we have the financial
department, the


538
0:24:39,85 --> 0:24:43,52
design department, and the
marketing department.


539
0:24:43,52 --> 0:24:46,63
And this is what we call
our lounge room.


540
0:24:46,63 --> 0:24:47,88
You guys play ping pong?


541
0:24:47,88 --> 0:24:52,74



542
0:24:52,74 --> 0:24:56,8
Skateboarding is the most
important subculture ever.


543
0:24:56,8 --> 0:24:59,195
If you've been skateboarding for
10 years, whatever you do


544
0:24:59,195 --> 0:25:1,5
with the rest of your life,
you're going to still have the


545
0:25:1,5 --> 0:25:6,46
same mentality, always remember
being a skateboarder.


546
0:25:6,46 --> 0:25:10,5
My generation, a lot of those
guys got into it because it


547
0:25:10,5 --> 0:25:11,49
was kind of trendy.


548
0:25:11,49 --> 0:25:12,92
Then it died out.


549
0:25:12,92 --> 0:25:17,5
After that, I started my own
skateboard company, actually a


550
0:25:17,5 --> 0:25:19,97
mail-order company out
of my apartment named


551
0:25:19,97 --> 0:25:22,8
Bam, Backside Airmail.


552
0:25:22,8 --> 0:25:26,88
Called Backside Airmail, Bam,
and our amazing stuff and make


553
0:25:26,88 --> 0:25:29,23
sure it get the best skateboard
products in three


554
0:25:29,23 --> 0:25:30,2
to four days.


555
0:25:30,2 --> 0:25:30,66
And that the [INAUDIBLE]


556
0:25:30,66 --> 0:25:33,95
skateboard staff was
me, myself, and I.


557
0:25:33,95 --> 0:25:37,55
But It was kind of funny,
because all the skaters in


558
0:25:37,55 --> 0:25:39,6
Sweden called and they were
like, you almost become a


559
0:25:39,6 --> 0:25:39,67
friend to everybody.


560
0:25:39,67 --> 0:25:42,93
It's like, hi, how are you?


561
0:25:42,93 --> 0:25:46,84
Me and Pontus started working
together back in '93.


562
0:25:46,84 --> 0:25:49,17
I actually had a skateboard camp
down in Gothenburg, and


563
0:25:49,17 --> 0:25:50,385
Pontus was there.


564
0:25:50,385 --> 0:25:52,89
Pontus Karlsson actually
had his own mail order.


565
0:25:52,89 --> 0:25:54,76
And we started talking, maybe
we should open up a


566
0:25:54,76 --> 0:25:58,68
distribution company together
and open up a store.


567
0:25:58,68 --> 0:26:1,68



568
0:26:1,68 --> 0:26:5,23
The reason why starting
G-Spot was [INAUDIBLE]


569
0:26:5,23 --> 0:26:7,2
skateboarding and have
a good time.


570
0:26:7,2 --> 0:26:12,8
And making money wasn't
that important.


571
0:26:12,8 --> 0:26:14,5
We did a lot of crazy stuff.


572
0:26:14,5 --> 0:26:17,36
But we've never been doing
anything to be mean.


573
0:26:17,36 --> 0:26:21,31
To be in Sweden, you could
actually do whatever.


574
0:26:21,31 --> 0:26:23,265
Of course, the police came and
knocked on the door and told


575
0:26:23,265 --> 0:26:25,85
us to stop selling liquor
and not have parties.


576
0:26:25,85 --> 0:26:27,1
But we didn't really
give a shit.


577
0:26:27,1 --> 0:26:35,22



578
0:26:35,22 --> 0:26:38,45
-Was G-Spot known as
the best shop?


579
0:26:38,45 --> 0:26:41,84
JEAN-PASCAL STRUWER: It was the
only shop to begin with.


580
0:26:41,84 --> 0:26:44,6
Through hanging out at the
G-Spot skate stop, I got to


581
0:26:44,6 --> 0:26:45,82
know all the skaters and
the cliques that


582
0:26:45,82 --> 0:26:47,9
were hanging out there--


583
0:26:47,9 --> 0:26:54,47
Jens Andersson, Pontus Karlsson,
Pelle Fredell, a


584
0:26:54,47 --> 0:26:55,72
couple more.


585
0:26:55,72 --> 0:26:58,32



586
0:26:58,32 --> 0:27:0,452
Actually, I made the
first video.


587
0:27:0,452 --> 0:27:10,83
It was called "G-Spot
Forever."


588
0:27:10,83 --> 0:27:13,83
JENS ANDERSSON: Early '90s,
the core group of


589
0:27:13,83 --> 0:27:15,64
skateboarders in Stockholm
couldn't be


590
0:27:15,64 --> 0:27:18,8
more than 25, 30 people.


591
0:27:18,8 --> 0:27:22,13
Skateboarding was really
in for a change there.


592
0:27:22,13 --> 0:27:25,9
And it was really ugly, fashion
wise and tricks wise.


593
0:27:25,9 --> 0:27:28,53



594
0:27:28,53 --> 0:27:31,14
The natural street skateboarding
scene in


595
0:27:31,14 --> 0:27:33,28
Stockholm has never
been that good.


596
0:27:33,28 --> 0:27:35,66
It has a very poor
architecture for


597
0:27:35,66 --> 0:27:37,6
skateboarding.


598
0:27:37,6 --> 0:27:40,91
MARTIN KARLSSON: The ground is
rough, so mini ramps was where


599
0:27:40,91 --> 0:27:42,16
people learned how to skate.


600
0:27:42,16 --> 0:27:50,48



601
0:27:50,48 --> 0:27:52,5
JEAN-PASCAL STRUWER: Right now,
we are in a park called


602
0:27:52,5 --> 0:27:57,59
[INAUDIBLE], which is a
legendary skate spot in the


603
0:27:57,59 --> 0:28:0,4
Stockholm skate scene.


604
0:28:0,4 --> 0:28:3,8
It was one of the places where
we hung out during the


605
0:28:3,8 --> 0:28:4,7
summertime.


606
0:28:4,7 --> 0:28:8,0
We would go to this mini ramp
and buy beers and hang out and


607
0:28:8,0 --> 0:28:9,34
laugh and have fun.


608
0:28:9,34 --> 0:28:16,41



609
0:28:16,41 --> 0:28:18,35
JENS ANDERSSON: In the early
days of Stockholm street


610
0:28:18,35 --> 0:28:21,93
skating, there was people from
different social backgrounds.


611
0:28:21,93 --> 0:28:23,8
I mean, there were people
from the really


612
0:28:23,8 --> 0:28:25,79
upscale parts of Stockholm.


613
0:28:25,79 --> 0:28:28,1
And there were people from
the more rougher


614
0:28:28,1 --> 0:28:29,95
neighborhoods as well.


615
0:28:29,95 --> 0:28:31,64
MARTIN KARLSSON: Some of the
skaters moved in from


616
0:28:31,64 --> 0:28:37,0
different parts of Sweden, and
we lived collectively.


617
0:28:37,0 --> 0:28:38,65
It was a strange period.


618
0:28:38,65 --> 0:28:43,22
No one really knows how anyone
got by financially.


619
0:28:43,22 --> 0:28:45,74
JENS ANDERSSON: Sell some
boards, some sweatshirts, and


620
0:28:45,74 --> 0:28:47,77
maybe sell something
else as well.


621
0:28:47,77 --> 0:28:51,39



622
0:28:51,39 --> 0:28:53,384
Well, the main spot, for
sure, was Sheraton


623
0:28:53,384 --> 0:28:55,312
Hotel, as we call it.


624
0:28:55,312 --> 0:28:57,38
But it's not really part
of Sheraton Hotel.


625
0:28:57,38 --> 0:29:1,17
It's just a delivery area
for some shops.


626
0:29:1,17 --> 0:29:4,27
It was outdoor but still
has a ceiling over it.


627
0:29:4,27 --> 0:29:7,47
So you were able to skate
there all year round.


628
0:29:7,47 --> 0:29:12,5
But there was these high metal
curbs and a manual


629
0:29:12,5 --> 0:29:13,4
pad, and that's it.


630
0:29:13,4 --> 0:29:16,48
And everybody was skating there
10 hours a day, and


631
0:29:16,48 --> 0:29:20,59
coming in from all over Sweden
just to skate this spot.


632
0:29:20,59 --> 0:29:24,4



633
0:29:24,4 --> 0:29:25,873
[CLAPPING]


634
0:29:25,873 --> 0:29:28,93
MARTIN KARLSSON: You get that?


635
0:29:28,93 --> 0:29:31,5
Always when you cut yourself
down here, you're like, what


636
0:29:31,5 --> 0:29:32,3
was that I cut myself on?


637
0:29:32,3 --> 0:29:34,67



638
0:29:34,67 --> 0:29:38,0
JENS ANDERSSON: And you kind
of remember the feeling you


639
0:29:38,0 --> 0:29:40,3
had when you were skating
back then.


640
0:29:40,3 --> 0:29:44,26



641
0:29:44,26 --> 0:29:46,364
-When we looked at the book "The
Sheraton Years," that was


642
0:29:46,364 --> 0:29:49,2
like the golden age for you
guys in terms of fun?


643
0:29:49,2 --> 0:29:50,86
GREGER HAGELIN: It was, like,
I mean, there's four


644
0:29:50,86 --> 0:29:53,52
generations of skateboarding.


645
0:29:53,52 --> 0:29:55,56
Jens did send that book to me.


646
0:29:55,56 --> 0:29:57,9
So I it at my office in LA.


647
0:29:57,9 --> 0:29:59,32
And I opened that book-- it
was a Friday afternoon--


648
0:29:59,32 --> 0:30:0,41
and started reading it.


649
0:30:0,41 --> 0:30:1,4
And I started to remember.


650
0:30:1,4 --> 0:30:4,99
And I started feeling really
sad, because skateboarding was


651
0:30:4,99 --> 0:30:6,25
very small at that time.


652
0:30:6,25 --> 0:30:10,77
And the same crowd of people
went to every contest, went to


653
0:30:10,77 --> 0:30:13,7
every spot, went out drinking
every night together.


654
0:30:13,7 --> 0:30:20,15
And it was a very, very special
time, for sure.


655
0:30:20,15 --> 0:30:20,83
JENS ANDERSSON: There
was a lot of


656
0:30:20,83 --> 0:30:22,46
pictures to choose from.


657
0:30:22,46 --> 0:30:28,16
And we decided to go with the
more insecure teenager on the


658
0:30:28,16 --> 0:30:32,15
way of growing up kind
of direction.


659
0:30:32,15 --> 0:30:34,15
I never really had an intention
of being a skate


660
0:30:34,15 --> 0:30:35,38
photographer.


661
0:30:35,38 --> 0:30:38,81
But at the time, I always had
a camera in my backpack,


662
0:30:38,81 --> 0:30:42,67
shooting regularly just
the people around me.


663
0:30:42,67 --> 0:30:46,52
Rather than trying to get the
perfect skate photo, I'm just


664
0:30:46,52 --> 0:30:51,74
trying to document the time
we were spending together.


665
0:30:51,74 --> 0:30:54,1
There was definitely a turning
point when the new


666
0:30:54,1 --> 0:30:56,93
skate park opened up.


667
0:30:56,93 --> 0:30:58,2
JENS ANDERSSON: YMCA.


668
0:30:58,2 --> 0:31:3,38
The chief for the YMCA, he was
really into doing stuff for


669
0:31:3,38 --> 0:31:6,13
kids and teens, and trying
to put his mind


670
0:31:6,13 --> 0:31:8,265
into subcultural stuff.


671
0:31:8,265 --> 0:31:10,18
MARTIN KARLSSON: So we had
something for the graffiti


672
0:31:10,18 --> 0:31:11,97
people and for the
skateboarders.


673
0:31:11,97 --> 0:31:13,95
And he even had a pub for


674
0:31:13,95 --> 0:31:16,9
skinheads down in the basement.


675
0:31:16,9 --> 0:31:19,9
They had taken skateboards from
the skateboarders and


676
0:31:19,9 --> 0:31:23,66
snapped them in half and
put them on the wall.


677
0:31:23,66 --> 0:31:28,66
That was how crazy it
was, that place.


678
0:31:28,66 --> 0:31:33,21
Ali Boulala, back then he was
so lightweight, so small he


679
0:31:33,21 --> 0:31:34,86
could jump down anything.


680
0:31:34,86 --> 0:31:38,44
When we started skating with
him, he cried every time he


681
0:31:38,44 --> 0:31:41,85
skated, because he was so
frustrated when he didn't


682
0:31:41,85 --> 0:31:43,602
skate good enough.


683
0:31:43,602 --> 0:31:46,97
You know, he was a huge Mike
Carroll fan at this time.


684
0:31:46,97 --> 0:31:48,85
I think this is the day
after he watched


685
0:31:48,85 --> 0:31:49,82
the Chocolate video.


686
0:31:49,82 --> 0:31:53,7
And Mike Carroll does the
feeble in Hubba Hideout.


687
0:31:53,7 --> 0:31:54,65
And he's just like, oh,
I got to do that.


688
0:31:54,65 --> 0:31:56,95
And he learned it.


689
0:31:56,95 --> 0:32:1,33
But he was always really aware
of what was going on in


690
0:32:1,33 --> 0:32:3,9
skateboarding, trick-wise,
style-wise.


691
0:32:3,9 --> 0:32:6,32
He always made the
right moves.


692
0:32:6,32 --> 0:32:11,26



693
0:32:11,26 --> 0:32:15,15
Greger drinking 40s,
Santa Monica beach.


694
0:32:15,15 --> 0:32:17,82
JENS ANDERSSON: The G-Spot era,
I think that was very


695
0:32:17,82 --> 0:32:21,36
important to the fact that skate
wing was getting back in


696
0:32:21,36 --> 0:32:22,32
the limelight again.


697
0:32:22,32 --> 0:32:23,26
And it was really cool.


698
0:32:23,26 --> 0:32:26,6
And there was different
companies that could offer


699
0:32:26,6 --> 0:32:28,62
money and sponsor stuff.


700
0:32:28,62 --> 0:32:30,997
We could step out of
the garage, you


701
0:32:30,997 --> 0:32:33,85
know, out of the darkness.


702
0:32:33,85 --> 0:32:36,36
-Would you bring a lot of the
skaters to the ASR Trade Show


703
0:32:36,36 --> 0:32:37,46
in Long Beach?


704
0:32:37,46 --> 0:32:37,985
GREGER HAGELIN: Yeah, sure.


705
0:32:37,985 --> 0:32:40,27
It's like our team, we used
to bring them there.


706
0:32:40,27 --> 0:32:43,35
So [INAUDIBLE], Andreas,
Ali Boulala, and


707
0:32:43,35 --> 0:32:46,76
all those guys, yeah.


708
0:32:46,76 --> 0:32:49,9
Back then it was like we were
part of this business


709
0:32:49,9 --> 0:32:50,7
just to have fun.


710
0:32:50,7 --> 0:32:53,75
And then we did that business
from '93 to '99.


711
0:32:53,75 --> 0:32:55,66
And then we decided
start up WESC.


712
0:32:55,66 --> 0:33:1,13



713
0:33:1,13 --> 0:33:4,58
This is a collaboration we do
with Be@rbricks, Medicom Toys.


714
0:33:4,58 --> 0:33:10,4
And going to be released
in January.


715
0:33:10,4 --> 0:33:11,95
You're from New York, so you'll
probably know Stash.


716
0:33:11,95 --> 0:33:12,365
-Yes.


717
0:33:12,365 --> 0:33:14,13
GREGER HAGELIN: He's From
Brooklyn as well.


718
0:33:14,13 --> 0:33:16,2
And this is a pair
of his denim.


719
0:33:16,2 --> 0:33:18,23
But this is with a gold
thread in it.


720
0:33:18,23 --> 0:33:19,86
And if you should sell
them, should


721
0:33:19,86 --> 0:33:23,24
probably cost about $5,000.


722
0:33:23,24 --> 0:33:24,49
So we don't sell those.


723
0:33:24,49 --> 0:33:26,88



724
0:33:26,88 --> 0:33:28,5
Then we had G-Spot.


725
0:33:28,5 --> 0:33:30,74
G was for a Swedish
word and name.


726
0:33:30,74 --> 0:33:31,68
[SWEDISH]


727
0:33:31,68 --> 0:33:33,69
is like all of us together.


728
0:33:33,69 --> 0:33:35,56
And then [INAUDIBLE], it's
actually the same


729
0:33:35,56 --> 0:33:39,2
feeling about us.


730
0:33:39,2 --> 0:33:42,93
I came down to [INAUDIBLE],
that skateboard place.


731
0:33:42,93 --> 0:33:46,4
And my son, he was 12 at that
time, and he was down there


732
0:33:46,4 --> 0:33:46,74
skateboarding.


733
0:33:46,74 --> 0:33:49,996
And every good skateboarder he
saw came up, hi, how are you?


734
0:33:49,996 --> 0:33:50,385
How are you?


735
0:33:50,385 --> 0:33:51,39
And he's like, how can you
know all those guys?


736
0:33:51,39 --> 0:33:52,68
Yeah, that's skateboarding.


737
0:33:52,68 --> 0:33:56,72
It's like you met them once,
and you know them for life.


738
0:33:56,72 --> 0:33:59,1
-Is your son aware of all the
generations of skateboarding?


739
0:33:59,1 --> 0:34:1,3
Does he see all the
old pictures.


740
0:34:1,3 --> 0:34:2,37
GREGER HAGELIN: He's 13.


741
0:34:2,37 --> 0:34:5,56
He thinks everyone
back then sucked.


742
0:34:5,56 --> 0:34:7,94
Of course, it's like in 10 years
from now, he'll probably


743
0:34:7,94 --> 0:34:9,78
respect it, but you know.


744
0:34:9,78 --> 0:34:11,3
-Yeah, that's typical.


745
0:34:11,3 --> 0:34:24,33



746
0:34:24,33 --> 0:34:28,612
-Pelle Fredell, he's my
father, Pelle Fredell.


747
0:34:28,612 --> 0:34:30,2
He gives me everything
I want, man.


748
0:34:30,2 --> 0:34:49,414
