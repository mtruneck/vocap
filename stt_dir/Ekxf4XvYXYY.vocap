###21 -Did you have the nickname Eric Pu-puppy?
###24 ERIC PUPECKI: No.
###25 -That's some genius.
###26 ERIC PUPECKI: Oh yeah, baby.
###27 Gotta figure out the little space.
###28 
###31 Right guys?
###32 
###35 Yeah, my daughter should be along soon.
###36 That's her, over there in the photo, in the yellow one.
###40 -Did you grow up close to here?
###43 ERIC PUPECKI: Yeah, close to here.
###43 We didn't grow up in this house though.
###46 This was my mom's house, and her husband.
###48 
###52 You know, these are all the hits.
###55 But we bring out the computer now, so there's no more--
###57 I got this new night that I bring a little vinyl out.
###60 But we just go out with big boxes like this of vinyl.
###64 I used to, anyway.
###65 -How did you get into it?
###68 ERIC PUPECKI: Just the local people around here, skaters.
###70 And it was just the great music, you know.
###74 These are some of my LPs.
###77 I don't get to them as much as I used to.
###79 I do plumbing work, and that's what I make my money with.
###82 When I used to be a pro skater, I'd sit in my room and
###84 oh, listen to album after album and hang around.
###87 -What year did you start skating?
###91 ERIC PUPECKI: I don't know, when I was like
###92 15, so 23 years ago.
###95 I got a late start, per se, 15, 16 years old.
###99 -But were you always involved in sports?
###102 ERIC PUPECKI: Yeah, I played baseball and I did BMX.
###105 The skateboard took the BMX bike away.
###108 A lot of little contests in Rhode Island--
###112 second place, sponsored, 1990.
###115 -Who were you sponsored by then?
###117 ERIC PUPECKI: It was just probably a local shop--
###118 the Watershed.
###120 -And how did you end up getting out there?
###122 ERIC PUPECKI: I just took the bus to San Francisco.
###126 I got on the bus with a couple friends, and I
###128 just went for it.
###129 It was quick, too.
###130 I was out there a month, and I was already sponsored and
###133 ready to rock.
###135 I just showed up at EMB and skated with
###137 everyone that was there.
###138 Jim Thiebaud was the first hook up, and James Kelch.
###141 Those guys liked me, so they would just give me stuff.
###143 My first photo was on Market Street doing the Thunder ad,
###147 doing that ollie over that fountain there.
###148 I was going big, pretty much.
###150 GINO IANNUCCI: He was out in San Francisco when I went to
###151 visit with Keenan and Huf.
###154 They were staying at Ron's house.
###156 And I think Eric was down with Fun, back then.
###159 I think that one trip, that's when I met Eric.
###162 He was just a good skater.
###164 -Who did you become friends with that was on Fun?
###166 ERIC PUPECKI: It was me, Keenan, and Huf.
###169 And that was the main three dudes that would roll.
###171 It would be Ron, Keenan, Huf, and me in the car, going
###175 around the tour fighting, having fun.
###177 But there was no money.
###179 So we're all just piled in a car, expected to
###183 do stuff for nothing.
###185 But we were having fun, so it didn't matter.
###187 -What were some of your favorite things
###189 that you got on video?
###191 ERIC PUPECKI: It's the things that I didn't get is some of
###194 the things that would be my favorite.
###197 The kickflip the Gonz had done had to be one
###199 of the great feelings--
###201 at the time, too.
###203 It was like two weeks after Gonz had done it.
###206 And the time I had the broke the board sequence was before
###210 Gonz had done it.
###211 So then Gonz was just hanging out one day and is like, oh,
###213 maybe I should just kickflip it.
###215 And he just goes and does it.
###217 And I was there, and I was like, fuck.
###219 And a couple weeks later I was skating it with somebody, and
###221 I just did it.
###222 But it felt really good.
###224 But I was like, fuck, three weeks ago, I could
###226 have been the first.
###229 -That 411 opener?
###230 ERIC PUPECKI: Yeah, the open the hardflip down the seven.
###233 Yeah, that felt real good too.
###234 I was happy with that because I was down and out.
###237 And I didn't have a sponsor right then either.
###238 I was just filming with Aaron, doing the thing.
###241 Mike Ternasky, at the time, he was trying to set me up.
###244 If I landed a couple good tricks, he'd throw me some
###246 money, give me the boards I'd need, keep going.
###248 Because he knew I didn't have a sponsor.
###250 I was kind of out there.
###252 Because I was talking to Mike Ternasky at the time, he was
###254 trying to set me up for Plan B and all that.
###258 Menace came along right around the same time,
###260 so I went for that.
###262 I remember he came up to me in Vancouver and said, yo, you
###265 didn't even tell me you were gonna jump on Menace.
###268 I wish you would have told me--
###270 just kind of breaking me up.
###271 He was happy for me, but he was just
###274 kind of saying whatever.
###275 Just giving me shit.
###276 -Were you filming a lot with Socrates then?
###278 ERIC PUPECKI: Oh yeah, that was like every day--
###282 go eat with Soc, go film with Soc, hang out with
###285 Soc, yell at Soc.
###286 It was a good time.
###287 He was great.
###288 He was the nicest person-- drive you
###290 anywhere, do anything.
###292 SOCRATES LEAL: Pupecki was always down to skate, but it
###293 seemed like he wasn't down to skate the stuff that the other
###295 dudes were skating.
###297 He had a different bag of tricks, definitely.
###300 He was kind of an innovator, it seemed to me.
###303 I don't think he was like one of those dudes that was
###306 busting flip and flip out type stuff.
###308 He was just the kind of dude that go for a back tail on a
###312 big rail, or front crooking the Venice ledge.
###316 -What about the Lockwood sessions?
###318 ERIC PUPECKI: Everyone's watching
###318 when you're out there.
###320 In Rhode Island, you're on a dead street with nobody, like
###322 you're there.
###322 In Lockwood, it's the center stage--
###326 everyone's filming, people ripping.
###328 This is a time when all these tricks are being done on the
###331 big benches for the first time.
###335 Even like a switch nosegrind on a top of a picnic table--
###338 no one had done it.
###340 I did the frontside blunt-- no one had done it.
###343 Every day it's a new trick, first time ever done.
###346 It was exciting--
###348 just go home and talk about the stuff.
###350 It was cool.
###352 -Did the team fit with your vibe at the time?
###355 ERIC PUPECKI: Yeah.
###356 We all got along right away.
###358 Everyone's smoking, everyone's drinking, skating.
###360 Just doing that all the time.
###363 It was just a good time.
###364 We got to move around a lot together and just be able to
###367 act as crazy as we wanted to be.
###371 And get treated with respect everywhere we went.
###373 And it was good.
###375 You can't beat that.
###376 -Were there any other people that you guys wanted to be on
###378 the team that never got on?
###379 ERIC PUPECKI: Nah.
###380 We had a team.
###381 It was almost like, who are we going to let into this?
###386 Nobody.
###386 Forget it.
###387 You know what I mean?
###388 Even Stevie Williams was dying to get on.
###391 We'd be sitting there drinking Hennessy in Philly.
###393 He'd be doing flat ground in front of us all night.
###395 Just trying to show us how high he could pop his shit.
###399 And look at Stevie now, he's fucking killing it.
###401 STEVIE WILLIAMS: Yeah, I was a fan.
###403 I've always been a fan of Kareem and Menace.
###406 And I always wanted to be on that team.
###409 That's the team that I wanted to be on.
###411 And it never happened.
###413 It's like buying a car, you know what I mean?
###415 I want the Lexus, but I had to settle for the goddamn Accord.
###418 You know what I mean?
###419 It sucked.
###420 But at least I got a chance to ride in a Lexus, you feel me?
###424 I was happy just knowing them dudes.
###427 It felt like, when I'm around them, I'm actually
###429 a part of the team.
###430 But I didn't get the product or go on a tour.
###433 ERIC PUPECKI: But then it got goofy.
###435 And then people like Caine Gayle got on.
###438 It just kind of took the integrity right
###440 out of it, I think.
###442 I wasn't down for that.
###445 And that's when I got grumpy.
###446 I was kind of distancing myself from
###449 everybody by being so grumpy.
###451 -You stayed on until the end, right?
###452 ERIC PUPECKI: Yeah, of course.
###453 But like I said, all that footage was mad old.
###456 They didn't want to use my footage because it was so old.
###458 I wasn't taking control, so I can't blame anybody.
###462 I don't regret none of that.
###464 Even though, like you said, I look back and I'm like, I
###467 should have done this, should have done that, but whatever,
###470 just keep going.
###471 -Does your daughter ever ask about your skate career?
###473 ERIC PUPECKI: Not too much.
###474 I don't talk about it.
###477 I just live in the present a lot of the times.
###481 I go through phases, like, I used to do that, but then get
###485 back to reality.
###486 -Has she ever seen "20 Shot Sequence" or anything?
###488 ERIC PUPECKI: She likes it all right, but she likes "iCarly,"
###490 she likes "Victorious," some shit like that.
###495 COREY GRAYHORSE: Good fall, though.
###498 Did you get our bunny?
###501 Uh oh, don't scratch it.
###505 -What's your bunny's name?
###506 CAILEE LOLA: Cupcake.
###508 This is my favorite.
###509 This one.
###511 It's a dolphin.
###512 -Oh yeah?
###512 CAILEE LOLA: Yeah.
###513 And this one's pretty funny.
###516 COREY GRAYHORSE: I met Eric in Long Beach, at ASR.
###520 You know, whatever, fun times lead to crazy weekend.
###524 I remember that Guru was performing that weekend.
###527 I remember Eric got arrested that weekend.
###530 Oh, I forgot she was here.
###532 CAILEE LOLA: You got arrested?
###535 -[INAUDIBLE].
###536 COREY GRAYHORSE: Yeah.
###537 Yeah, he got arrested and Keenan bailed him out.
###539 CAILEE LOLA: For what?
###540 ERIC PUPECKI: Nothing.
###542 COREY GRAYHORSE: For being too silly.
###544 CAILEE LOLA: Oh.
###544 COREY GRAYHORSE: And that's why.
###545 ERIC PUPECKI: Way too silly.
###547 COREY GRAYHORSE: He wasn't being a good boy.
###549 They were crazy.
###551 -It was just sort of like, who's that guy in the
###553 beginning of the "20 Shot Sequence"?
###555 ERIC PUPECKI: Matt Naylor.
###556 He was a good guy.
###557 That was Billy's right-hand man.
###560 One time we were all just buzzed in Hollywood.
###562 And he had an old BMW 320--
###565 his dad's car.
###567 I was like, yo, take me to McDonald's.
###568 And he fucking took me to McDonald's.
###569 I jump out, I slam the door, the whole
###571 fucking window smashes.
###573 So he gets out, and he's like, dude, what the fuck?
###577 I go like this, I flinch him and then I hit him in the
###578 shoulder two times after I break his window.
###580 I mean, shit was crazy.
###582 You know what I mean?
###583 I slammed his door, broke his window, then I punched him in
###586 his arm two times.
###588 Not nice.
###589 That's fucked up.
###590
