###0 EDDIE HUANG: The people you talk to in LA when you come on
###2 business, anything you ask them they're going to tell you
###4 it's great.
###5 You get oh, we should do an upper decker right now.
###7 That's be fantastic.
###8 You should definitely do the upper decker.
###10 Right now.
###11 Lunchtime upper decker.
###12 Who doesn't like that?
###13 You know?
###13 I'm like no, really, that's not a good idea.
###16 Stop me.
###16 Somebody got to stop me.

###37 EDDIE HUANG: Yo, I'm going to drop the ill disclaimer on you
###39 here, the "Midsummer Night's Dream." If we shadows have
###41 offended, blame vice.
###43 Because we're here, since there's a cheap ride from San
###46 Francisco to LA.
###47 Two episodes, one plane flight, you already know.
###50 The saving grace is that I'm introducing you to my dude Roy
###53 Choi, and we're going to East LA.
###55 Which is actually a very charming, ill, Mexican
###58 neighborhood, and we're going to have the best tacos you've
###60 ever seen at Guisados.
###62 
###65 EDDIE HUANG: What's up Roy?
###66 ROY CHOI: What's up man?
###67 EDDIE HUANG: What's good?
###68 How's it going?
###68 How's it going?
###69 ROY CHOI: Good, welcome to East LA, Boyle Heights.
###70 EDDIE HUANG: This is not Hollywood kid.
###71 ROY CHOI: It's not Hollywood, but it is the
###73 real LA, you know?
###74 EDDIE HUANG: Definitely.
###74 I've been to LA a few times, and really it's suspect to me.
###79 You know what I'm saying?
###80 Everyone I come visit is just trying to show me
###82 another pool deck.
###83 You know?
###84 Another roof deck.
###85 ROY CHOI: This is the real deal.
###86 This is East LA man.
###87 EDDIE HUANG: Oh wow.
###89 ROY CHOI: This is a piece of culture you don't see much on
###91 the east coast.
###92 Because you don't get a lot of the same immigration to New
###96 York from the states of Mexico that you get here.
###99 So this is chicharon.
###101 EDDIE HUANG: Just so you all know, usually I give you a lot
###103 of the food technical aspects.
###105 But this is Chef vs. Chef, Spy vs. Spy today man, I'm going
###108 to leave it to Roy, you know what I mean?
###109 This is his town.
###110 It's always ill to meet other Jedis.
###111 And Roy is definitely Jedi master.
###114 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###128 EDDIE HUANG: So what are we getting Roy?
###131 ROY CHOI: You got to get anything here.
###133 The cochinita pibil, the mole poblano.
###136 I don't meat anymore, so I'm going to get some of the
###138 veggie stuff.
###139 EDDIE HUANG: For real?
###139 ROY CHOI: Yeah.
###140 Armando, you got to give him some of your best.
###142 Probably the cochinita right?
###144 ARMANDO: The cochinita.
###145 And today's special, we have costillas in mole negro.
###149 ROY CHOI: That's probably good for him.
###150 ARMANDO: OK.
###152 
###154 EDDIE HUANG: Thank you so much.
###155 
###158 Where do you live in LA?
###160 ROY CHOI: In Korean town.
###161 EDDIE HUANG: OK, did you grow up out there?
###163 ROY CHOI: I moved around a lot.
###164 My parents came in the early '70s.
###167 For any Asian immigrant at that time you
###169 couldn't get a job.
###170 Because you were looked at as a brown, slanty-eyed,
###173 dark-haired motherfucker.
###174 EDDIE HUANG: Yeah, you washed clothes or you cooked food, or
###176 you drove cars.
###176 ROY CHOI: Washed clothes, or cooked
###177 food, or you're a janitor.
###179 Or, with the Koreans coming in the early days here in LA, you
###182 opened your own business.
###183 During my main period of elementary school, I was
###187 mainly in the restaurant.
###188 That's where a lot of my whole understanding and love
###192 of food came from.
###193 EDDIE HUANG: I came back to food after doing the law,
###197 trying to be a journalist, doing all these things.
###199 Because I realized that I would be given a fair shake in
###203 food, but I wouldn't be given a fair shake at a lot of
###205 other-- people expect us to be good at food.
###207 ROY CHOI: For me, a lot of my cousins are really smart and
###210 do really well, and I was always the black sheep.
###213 You know?
###213 Like fuck man, I can't sit in this
###216 laboratory and split cells.
###218 I just can't do that.
###220 And then it started to wear on my whole consciousness of like
###224 I'm a fucking loser, I'm a failure.
###225 EDDIE HUANG: Because you didn't fit this model minority
###227 stereotype thing.
###227 ROY CHOI: I didn't fit that, and then I think it took this
###229 whole generation through the '80s and '90s for us to mutate
###234 and evolve.
###235 And now it's just coming into fruition where we're doing it
###239 with expression in our own ways.
###241 This is homemade masa for tamales and tortillas.
###244 Come on in.
###245 Especially for you East Coast guys.
###247 
###249 This stuff is new to y'all.
###251 ARMANDO: This is dried corn, it comes in a dry state.
###255 And it doesn't actually boil and it doesn't cook.
###257 We just steep it.
###258 After it's rinsed it goes into the hopper right behind you.
###263 [SNEEZES]
###264 EDDIE HUANG: I'm sorry.
###264 Man, the smell and flavor is so strong,
###266 I'm sneezing in here.
###268 ARMANDO: Take this ground corn.
###269 At this point we can take this and add lard, shortening, to
###273 it, and make masa for tamales.
###275 At this point it's good for tortillas.
###276 EDDIE HUANG: Delicious.
###277 You don't usually see this process.
###278 ROY CHOI: You don't.
###279 This is the west coast pizza dough right here.
###281 [LAUGHTER]
###283 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###309 ARMANDO: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###317 ROY CHOI: Amazing.
###318 EDDIE HUANG: Hot sauce?
###319 ARMANDO: Yeah, hot sauce.
###320 EDDIE HUANG: Yeah, let's get some on the side.
###321 ROY CHOI: The thing about Guisados, is
###323 guisados means a stew.
###324 This is a stewed style of taco, but I
###325 think you'll enjoy.
###326 EDDIE HUANG: No, I tell you what.
###327 Unless it's a high heat broiled, I really think
###331 proteins should be
###332 slow-roasted, braised, something.
###334 Something to get the glutamates
###336 out in a slower way.
###337 ROY CHOI: This is kind of like the LA vibe right here.
###340 When you're eating, there ain't nowhere else to go.
###342 There's no before, there's no after.
###344 It's just right now.
###344 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###351 EDDIE HUANG: I've never had a tortilla like this, this good.
###354 Anywhere outside of East LA, in America you don't see
###358 tortillas like this.
###359 You know, I grew up in Orlando.
###360 A lot of Mexicans in Orlando.
###362 They made great tortillas, but they were the white ones, the
###365 flat, that are more flimsy.
###367 This is toothsome, this is like al dente.
###369 You know?
###369 ROY CHOI: Yeah.
###370 This fucking salsa is so spicy.
###372 EDDIE HUANG: Mm.
###373 ROY CHOI: Hell yeah, right?
###375 Oh man.
###378 EDDIE HUANG: Oh yeah.
###380 That chili sauce is en fuego, I'm not doing that.
###384 My ass would be on fire by 7:00 PM.
###391 ROY CHOI: The last two generations of American kids,
###394 you wake up and you have fucking Pop Tarts.
###396 And then at lunch, you have a fucking Hot Pocket.
###399 You know?
###399 And then at dinner, you're having
###402 fucking Hamburger Helper.
###404 And none of that shit is at a table, none of that shit is
###407 with other people.
###409 On a daily fucking basis, that shit is just
###412 fucking like corrosive.
###412 EDDIE HUANG: There's people who eat microwave
###414 meals or Pop Tarts.
###415 There's us who eat homemade.
###417 We all do what we do because of the environments we grew up
###420 in, and we just want people to get the whole spectrum.
###423 And you make your own decision.
###425 ROY CHOI: I want to make food as cool as Monsters and Red
###429 Bulls and Pop Tarts.
###431 I want to make it as cool as the McRib.
###433 So that way food is a part of their life, and
###436 they can make a choice.
###437 EDDIE HUANG: Much respect, kid.
###439 Much fucking respect.
###440 ROY CHOI: Yeah you got to pay homage, definitely.
###443 EDDIE HUANG: I really don't hang out with that many chefs.
###446 And Roy is one of those people that transcends
###449 being a chef to me.
###450 He understands things in and outside of the plate.
###453 He takes it beyond, and he's really trying to tell a story
###457 with his food, with his actions, with his business.
###460 And I really relate to that a lot man.
###463 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###474 EDDIE HUANG: Next up on "Fresh Off the Boat"
###476 PETER: Back then the guy riding shotgun had a shotgun.
###481 I say the person sitting in the passenger
###483 seat now is my kid.
###486 And I don't need nobody shooting at me
###488 because of old beefs.
###490 EDDIE HUANG: Yeah.
###491
