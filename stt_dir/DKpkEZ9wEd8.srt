0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:5,43



2
0:0:5,43 --> 0:0:8,792
SPIKE JONZE: Here's my new
song I just wrote.


3
0:0:8,792 --> 0:0:11,774
SHANE SMITH: [INAUDIBLE].


4
0:0:11,774 --> 0:0:18,732
SPIKE JONZE: (SINGING) Sailor,
sailor, Come home.


5
0:0:18,732 --> 0:0:26,187
Oh, sailor, sailor, come home.


6
0:0:26,187 --> 0:0:27,181
How's that?


7
0:0:27,181 --> 0:0:28,21
SHANE SMITH: Super cool.


8
0:0:28,21 --> 0:0:29,53
SPIKE JONZE: Super cool.


9
0:0:29,53 --> 0:0:30,45
All right, so Shane--


10
0:0:30,45 --> 0:0:31,77
SHANE SMITH: Oh, shit.


11
0:0:31,77 --> 0:0:32,65
SPIKE JONZE: What?


12
0:0:32,65 --> 0:0:33,9
SHANE SMITH: My tutti
went frutti.


13
0:0:33,9 --> 0:0:36,35



14
0:0:36,35 --> 0:0:38,26
How do you keep yours?


15
0:0:38,26 --> 0:0:40,264
SPIKE JONZE: Give it
a double wrap.


16
0:0:40,264 --> 0:0:41,514
SHANE SMITH: Double.


17
0:0:41,514 --> 0:0:44,67



18
0:0:44,67 --> 0:0:46,35
SPIKE JONZE: Where does
Vice go from here?


19
0:0:46,35 --> 0:0:49,98
What's the plan for
your company?


20
0:0:49,98 --> 0:0:52,25
SHANE SMITH: I think that
because it's getting bigger


21
0:0:52,25 --> 0:0:54,33
and bigger now, it's either
going to become a next


22
0:0:54,33 --> 0:0:58,36
generation media company, or
it's going to flare out.


23
0:0:58,36 --> 0:1:0,27
Just really spectacularly.


24
0:1:0,27 --> 0:1:3,15
We're just going to spend $100
million on a party and then


25
0:1:3,15 --> 0:1:5,209
not show up the next day.


26
0:1:5,209 --> 0:1:7,81
End up in Vietnam selling
Cokes on the beach.


27
0:1:7,81 --> 0:1:11,0



28
0:1:11,0 --> 0:1:12,1
SPIKE JONZE: How are you
going to decide which


29
0:1:12,1 --> 0:1:12,97
way to go with it?


30
0:1:12,97 --> 0:1:13,99
SHANE SMITH: Well,
I won't decide.


31
0:1:13,99 --> 0:1:14,84
SPIKE JONZE: Oh.


32
0:1:14,84 --> 0:1:17,32
SHANE SMITH: It'll be a thing.


33
0:1:17,32 --> 0:1:19,11
SPIKE JONZE: When are you
that your happiest?


34
0:1:19,11 --> 0:1:24,77



35
0:1:24,77 --> 0:1:27,97
SHANE SMITH: I'm at my happiest
when I'm in my bed


36
0:1:27,97 --> 0:1:29,56
with my wife and my
baby, because I


37
0:1:29,56 --> 0:1:31,13
love them both insanely.


38
0:1:31,13 --> 0:1:33,65
Like, it's like love you've
never felt before.


39
0:1:33,65 --> 0:1:36,54
Like, you have a baby, and
you're just like, all I want


40
0:1:36,54 --> 0:1:39,14
to do is make the baby happy.


41
0:1:39,14 --> 0:1:41,83



42
0:1:41,83 --> 0:1:45,17
I was a pretty selfish
guy my whole life.


43
0:1:45,17 --> 0:1:46,9
I was essentially a teenager
till I was


44
0:1:46,9 --> 0:1:49,5
like, in my late 30's.


45
0:1:49,5 --> 0:1:55,7
And I lived for my own pleasure,
and you know, ego.


46
0:1:55,7 --> 0:1:58,6
And then when you have a kid,
your ego goes out the window,


47
0:1:58,6 --> 0:1:59,99
and all your pleasure--


48
0:1:59,99 --> 0:2:2,66
not all of it, but like,
comes from them.


49
0:2:2,66 --> 0:2:4,39
And oh, I bought a house.


50
0:2:4,39 --> 0:2:6,485
That makes me feel happy,
but not for me.


51
0:2:6,485 --> 0:2:9,38
But because like, my kid has a
place to live, and my wife as


52
0:2:9,38 --> 0:2:11,18
a place to have the baby.


53
0:2:11,18 --> 0:2:12,55
That's when I'm happiest.


54
0:2:12,55 --> 0:2:14,42
But I like shooting.


55
0:2:14,42 --> 0:2:17,17
I like coming to crazy
places and shooting.


56
0:2:17,17 --> 0:2:19,66
Not because of the shooting
and stuff, but because it


57
0:2:19,66 --> 0:2:21,53
forces me to think about
stuff that I've never


58
0:2:21,53 --> 0:2:22,86
thought about before.


59
0:2:22,86 --> 0:2:23,36
You know?


60
0:2:23,36 --> 0:2:24,61
And so that makes me happy.


61
0:2:24,61 --> 0:2:27,24



62
0:2:27,24 --> 0:2:28,7
SPIKE JONZE: How should
this interview end?


63
0:2:28,7 --> 0:2:33,17



64
0:2:33,17 --> 0:2:38,84
SHANE SMITH: You should ask
me how it all ends.


65
0:2:38,84 --> 0:2:40,69
SPIKE JONZE: Shane Smith,
how does it all end?


66
0:2:40,69 --> 0:2:45,76



67
0:2:45,76 --> 0:2:49,84
SHANE SMITH: I just got married,
and I had a baby.


68
0:2:49,84 --> 0:2:55,4
And now I want to build
a family seat.


69
0:2:55,4 --> 0:3:1,3
And I want to find it by a
beautiful cove, like this one.


70
0:3:1,3 --> 0:3:2,86
Remote.


71
0:3:2,86 --> 0:3:6,2
And I want to build a house
where my kids can grow up, and


72
0:3:6,2 --> 0:3:8,34
where you can come visit me.


73
0:3:8,34 --> 0:3:13,95
And the young kids can make
Vice, and we can make books


74
0:3:13,95 --> 0:3:15,48
and movies, and TV shows.


75
0:3:15,48 --> 0:3:17,21
Or model airplanes.


76
0:3:17,21 --> 0:3:19,63
Or whatever the fuck
we want to make.


77
0:3:19,63 --> 0:3:21,89
And we'll grow old happy.


78
0:3:21,89 --> 0:3:26,74
We'll grow big beards, and
we'll eat sausages.


79
0:3:26,74 --> 0:3:28,895
And we'll drink lemonade.


80
0:3:28,895 --> 0:3:31,52
And we'll lie in the hammock.


81
0:3:31,52 --> 0:3:37,5
And we'll discuss why you're
still a bastard.


82
0:3:37,5 --> 0:3:38,75
SPIKE JONZE: OK.


83
0:3:38,75 --> 0:3:42,72



84
0:3:42,72 --> 0:3:44,22
SHANE SMITH: Can we go
for a swim now, papi?


85
0:3:44,22 --> 0:3:45,42
SPIKE JONZE: Yeah.


86
0:3:45,42 --> 0:5:45,42
