Hey Food Tubers!
Since we're having such a good relationship


2
0:0:7,249 --> 0:0:13,48
and so much chemistry I thought to bring you
here on our first trip like our mini honeymoon


3
0:0:13,48 --> 0:0:19,95
to this incredible place called Gualeguaychú,
in the provence of Entre Ríos. And here,


4
0:0:19,95 --> 0:0:26,63
I will make for you guys a braised bondiola
with a white and creamy risotto beside the


5
0:0:26,63 --> 0:0:32,18
river.
Let me show you how to start. Here I have


6
0:0:32,18 --> 0:0:40,29
the meat - bondiola, pork. Situated, located
on the back side of the neck. Now I will season


7
0:0:40,29 --> 0:0:48,69
it using pepper, some salt and drizzle it
using olive oil. What we're going to do now


8
0:0:48,69 --> 0:0:55,489
is to take the meat to my Parrilla. Don't
have a Parrilla? Don't worry, you can replace


9
0:0:55,489 --> 0:1:1,39
it using a grill. Now you will listen to the
sounds of heaven. This is what we are looking


10
0:1:1,39 --> 0:1:8,31
for, the contrast between the crust and the
inside which will be smooth, it will be soft,


11
0:1:8,31 --> 0:1:14,0
it will be wonderful. And what we are making
here is to make it flying first class! We


12
0:1:14,0 --> 0:1:21,359
are making an upgrade to the pork!
Come and look at this. Let me show you what I


13
0:1:21,359 --> 0:1:29,53
am talking about. This beautiful and amazing
crust. While this is searing from all the


14
0:1:29,53 --> 0:1:37,219
sides, I will use a big pan and inside I will
put baby carrots, small onions. This will


15
0:1:37,219 --> 0:1:46,99
be like the bed of our pork. Some thyme, good.
And the amazing bondiola, incredible, amazing


16
0:1:46,99 --> 0:1:56,149
and tasty. Take it to your pan, spread a tablespoon
of mustard, some sweet soya sauce. Look at


17
0:1:56,149 --> 0:2:9,3
this, look at the consistency. Now also, black
beer! To the pan, 1 bottle. Look at this my


18
0:2:9,3 --> 0:2:17,89
friends! This is like a festival of flavours.
And a party of all ingredients joining inside


19
0:2:17,89 --> 0:2:24,9
and sweet potatoes in syrup! I buy them on
the market, you do not know where to get them


20
0:2:24,9 --> 0:2:31,11
you can just buy any fruit you like in syrup
or if not you can replace it with any fruit


21
0:2:31,11 --> 0:2:37,14
you like. I will put them all because I like
them very much and I'm also spreading in some


22
0:2:37,14 --> 0:2:47,819
of the syrup. Put on the lid, let them join
the party and take this to the fire. Put it


23
0:2:47,819 --> 0:2:53,7
over here and now my suggestion - three hours.  
In three hours come and look at it like me,


24
0:2:53,7 --> 0:2:58,989
which I am going to do something else here
in Gualeguaychú beside the river and we'll


25
0:2:58,989 --> 0:3:13,0
come back in three hours.


26
0:3:13,0 --> 0:3:17,15
I have just finished my test on the tractor


27
0:3:17,15 --> 0:3:25,54
driving licence. I had an excellent and now
I can drive tractors everywhere. Now I didn't


28
0:3:25,54 --> 0:3:33,99
forgot about my bondiola. So now, I think
it is almost ready I will prepare a white


29
0:3:33,99 --> 0:3:39,12
and creamy risotto. Very simple because all
the flavours are here inside, as I told you,


30
0:3:39,12 --> 0:3:46,329
in this festival. Ok let's begin with the
risotto. You have some butter, put it to melt.


31
0:3:46,329 --> 0:3:57,879
Half an onion. Take this onion to your pan
- good. Now add two cups of rice, carnaroli


32
0:3:57,879 --> 0:4:7,62
rice. Look at this beautiful risotto rice.
Now pour in one, two cups. That's ok. Mix


33
0:4:7,62 --> 0:4:17,79
it. It is very simple but we have to keep
on stirring. Now add some stock, yeah baby!


34
0:4:17,79 --> 0:4:25,6
Some salt and pepper would be great. Pepper,
salt! It will take around fifteen minutes


35
0:4:25,6 --> 0:4:33,54
to be ready. Keep on adding some stock when
it requires. But now over here I have the big


36
0:4:33,54 --> 0:4:43,2
guest, my bondiola! Oooooh! Look at this,
the liquids have reduced. Everything is of


37
0:4:43,2 --> 0:4:56,0
the colour of the beer! Super amazing. Look,
these are shreds of glory.


38
0:4:56,0 --> 0:5:0,29
Mmmmmmm great!


39
0:5:0,29 --> 0:5:9,69
Now take a very nice dish or plate. Add a
nice and generous spoon of your risotto. Now


40
0:5:9,69 --> 0:5:18,2
take your pork, take the flavours to the dish
right now.


41
0:5:18,2 --> 0:5:22,2
Amazing! Now, the final touch,


42
0:5:22,2 --> 0:5:31,66
your nice vegetables, your beer, your mustard,
oh my God! Good! Finish it up using some sprouts.


43
0:5:31,66 --> 0:5:43,77
Super amazing, look! This deserves to be eaten
in a great spot. Mmmmmm, totally an upgrade!


44
0:5:43,77 --> 0:5:51,5
