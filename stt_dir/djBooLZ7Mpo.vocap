###16 PATRICK O'DELL: What's up?
###17 This is day one--
###18 I guess day two of the trip.
###20 First day of skating.
###21 We're in Medford, Oregon.
###24 I noticed the Anti-Hero team was up at like 8:00 in the
###26 morning or something, ready to skate.
###29 The Girl team rolled in about noon.
###31 
###36 Mike, I noticed Girls slept in later than Anti-Hero today.
###38 
###41 MIKE CARROLL: Beauty rest.
###42 
###49 It's kind of pretty unreal watching [INAUDIBLE]
###52 skate around.
###53 I've never seen anything like it.
###54 PATRICK O'DELL: It's pretty sick.
###55 MIKE CARROLL: Everyone's rippin'.
###56 MALE SPEAKER: That is beautiful.
###57 MALE SPEAKER: This is called Touch of Sparkle.
###59 
###62 MALE SPEAKER: Maybe the [INAUDIBLE] rock tail stall
###64 combo again.
###65 MALE SPEAKER: You gotta complete it now.
###66 
###72 There she goes.
###74 PATRICK O'DELL: I don't know, I think we're going to go to a
###76 bunch of parks today.
###77 Julien's tourguiding, so we'll see where he takes us.
###80 That's it.
###81 I don't know.
###81 Skate day.
###83 
###94 MALE SPEAKER: What's it about, helmets?
###96 MALE SPEAKER: I guess.
###97 
###101 What the hell?
###102 
###106 MAX SCHAAF: Skate at your own risk.
###108 POLICE OFFICER: OK, keep going.
###108 MAX SCHAAF: Know your abilities.
###110 POLICE OFFICERS: How about, approved helmets
###111 required at all times?
###112 MAX SCHAAF: Even for grown ups, hey?
###113 POLICE OFFICER: Doesn't say.
###114 So that means yeah.
###116 MAX SCHAAF: Well.
###118 See ya.
###120 POLICE OFFICER: You're trespassed from the property,
###122 so you need to leave.
###123 So I'm following you.
###124 PATRICK O'DELL: Why's that?
###126 POLICE OFFICER: 'Cause there's no
###126 skateboarding without helmets.
###128 PATRICK O'DELL: I'm not skating.
###130 POLICE OFFICER: But you're trespassed.
###132 So you can go.
###132 PATRICK O'DELL: What do you mean?
###134 I'm not trespassing, I'm just--
###134 POLICE OFFICER: You can go.
###137 JOHN CARDIEL: He came in kind of hot, right?
###140 You know license expired, where's your helmets at, who's
###142 the driver of the vehicle?
###143 It's like, fuck you, dude.
###145 MALE SPEAKER: Give me one problem at a time.
###146 JOHN CARDIEL: Right.
###146 MAX SCHAAF: You know, John, how whenever they come up, you
###148 go, gentlemen.
###149 You know, they say gentlemen?
###150 JOHN CARDIEL: Right, right.
###151 MAX SCHAAF: He came up, and I go, gentlemen.
###152 And he goes, start your engines.
###153 JOHN CARDIEL: Wow.
###154 MAX SCHAAF: Yeah.
###155 JOHN CARDIEL: Beat it.
###156 MAX SCHAAF: Heard that one.
###157 JOHN CARDIEL: Kick rocks.
###160 MALE SPEAKER: That was sick, did you see that?
###162 PATRICK O'DELL: What did he do?
###163 MALE SPEAKER: Step hopped the whole fucking island, dude.
###166 Film this shit, bro.
###167 
###173 PATRICK O'DELL: It seemed like with those two teams combined,
###176 there's somebody that could skate anything.
###178 JOHN ALDEN: Yeah, yeah.
###179 Like a good spark.
###180 PATRICK O'DELL: Like it could be a manual pad, or like a 13
###182 foot wall, that somebody could go.
###184 JOHN ALDEN: Yeah.
###185 Yeah.
###185 It was rad.
###187 Well rounded crew.
###188 
###191 FRANK GERWER: What was one of your favorite parts of the
###193 tour, O'Dell?
###194 Let me see that.
###195 PATRICK O'DELL: All my favorite things are swimming
###198 spots and scenic--
###199 JOHN ALDEN: Yeah.
###199 PATRICK O'DELL: Remember when we went to
###201 that cold rock river?
###202 JOHN ALDEN: The first one, like when we started driving
###204 through that field?
###204 PATRICK O'DELL: It was freezing cold.
###205 JOHN ALDEN: Like the first one we went to?
###207 PATRICK O'DELL: I really liked that.
###208 JOHN ALDEN: Yeah.
###209 PATRICK O'DELL: It was like ice.
###210 JOHN ALDEN: Yeah.
###211 It was hella cold.
###211 PATRICK O'DELL: Because I think it was like melted snow.
###213 
###220 MALE SPEAKER: Ah, come on.
###222 MALE SPEAKER: Keystone.
###223 This river's good for keeping the beer's cold.
###226 Throw 'em right there at the base.
###228 
###231 MALE SPEAKER: Pretty potent.
###233 Pretty potent and brisk.
###236 FRANK GERWER: Fuck, that sucked.
###238 
###242 MALE SPEAKER: Good way to wake up, Patrick.

###562 MALE SPEAKER: Whoo!
###563 
###570 Whoo!

###584 PATRICK O'DELL: What about Julien?
###586 Had you seen him skate in person?
###587 ALEX OLSON: No.
###589 He wouldn't skate that much.
###591 Or he would, but he'd be trying something, and everyone
###595 would sit down and start watching it.
###596 And he'd be like, be over it.
###597 He's kind of like [INAUDIBLE] in that sense.
###600 Like, doing his own thing, and once five people notice it,
###605 he's like, oh fuck.
###606 I'm over it.
###607 
###610 PATRICK O'DELL: Do you like how he skates?
###613 ALEX OLSON: Oh yeah.
