bjbj< Brandon Schauer: When I think about
John, I think about the William Gibson quote


2
0:0:6,85 --> 0:0:11,62
that s quite popular, which is, The future
is already here. It s just not evenly distributed.


3
0:0:11,62 --> 0:0:20,5
John s a guy who goes and finds where it s
unevenly distributed, too. Tells the story.


4
0:0:20,5 --> 0:0:26,59
Brings back empirical data about it, and tells
us what matters about it. I think he s really


5
0:0:26,59 --> 0:0:31,66
important for this crowd because he s going
to tell us about the way our work needs to


6
0:0:31,66 --> 0:0:37,64
change. Our work, anyone in an organization
who really wants to be relevant and perform


7
0:0:37,64 --> 0:0:42,82
well. As you can see from the program, he
has quite a distinguished background. He s


8
0:0:42,82 --> 0:0:49,14
held top positions, leading consultancies,
such as McKinsey and Boston Consulting Group,


9
0:0:49,14 --> 0:0:55,6
and he s currently serving as a co-chair of
the Silicon Valley-based Deloitte LP Center


10
0:0:55,6 --> 0:1:2,1
for the Edge, and he s doing a lot of original
research to develop new points of view on


11
0:1:2,1 --> 0:1:9,35
corporate growth, but the latest of his books,
which is down here cause I just had him sign


12
0:1:9,35 --> 0:1:14,96
it, co-authored with John Seely Brown and
Lang Davison, is The Power of Pull from which


13
0:1:14,96 --> 0:1:21,64
he will be pulling some of his ideas for today.
So I think it s critical for us to listen


14
0:1:21,64 --> 0:1:27,17
to him because he s going to tell us what
needs to change about how we need to work.


15
0:1:27,17 --> 0:1:31,159
As mentors of your acts, you re already in
a potentially powerful position as being someone


16
0:1:31,159 --> 0:1:37,28
who spends time with customers and spends
a lot of time looking at the behaviors they


17
0:1:37,28 --> 0:1:42,96
have. There s an interesting stream of data
that you cross and pull into your own organizations


18
0:1:42,96 --> 0:1:47,689
and see how the organization is actually doing
work to serve these customers. These are two


19
0:1:47,689 --> 0:1:55,1
critical points of data, but I caution that
if we don t spend time listening and paying


20
0:1:55,1 --> 0:2:1,24
attention to what John has to say, and the
realizations he has about the nature of how


21
0:2:1,24 --> 0:2:5,53
our work should change, we could potentially
be marginalized and really left behind those


22
0:2:5,53 --> 0:2:12,49
who are really performing well and better
than us in the UX business. So please listen


23
0:2:12,49 --> 0:2:25,669
up, and I d love to invite John Hagel III
to the stage. John Hagel III: Hi. It s great


24
0:2:25,669 --> 0:2:30,459
to be here this afternoon. I m particularly
privileged to speak a group that s at the


25
0:2:30,459 --> 0:2:37,2
leading edge of experience design. It s somewhat
intimidating, though, because I confess I


26
0:2:37,2 --> 0:2:46,9
come before you without any slides whatsoever
or any visual aids whatsoever so I am the


27
0:2:46,9 --> 0:2:54,749
experience here. It s clear that I m not a
designer. I m a simple business guy. I think


28
0:2:54,749 --> 0:3:0,9
I m what many of you refer to as the suits,
and I don t think you re referring to the


29
0:3:0,9 --> 0:3:6,569
fine cut of our tailored suits when you use
that term. ll just start by saying that I


30
0:3:6,569 --> 0:3:14,54
m in awe of what you ve accomplished over
the past decade. Moving the design mentality


31
0:3:14,54 --> 0:3:21,999
mindset skill set from the design of products
and services to the design of experiences


32
0:3:21,999 --> 0:3:28,609
of the users of those products and services
helps to more effectively pull out the real


33
0:3:28,609 --> 0:3:35,499
potential value of the products and services
they re dealing with, but as impressive as


34
0:3:35,499 --> 0:3:41,689
that is, I want to suggest that there s another
wave of opportunity ahead, and that is to


35
0:3:41,689 --> 0:3:49,739
design experiences that help all of us to
pull out the full potential of ourselves,


36
0:3:49,739 --> 0:3:56,699
and not just the products and services that
we use. What if we could apply the tools and


37
0:3:56,699 --> 0:4:3,689
principles of experience design to help each
of us to more effectively drive more rapid


38
0:4:3,689 --> 0:4:10,26
waves of learning and performance improvement
by working together? I want to illustrate


39
0:4:10,26 --> 0:4:15,749
that opportunity by going back in time to
the beginning of my career. As Brandon mentioned,


40
0:4:15,749 --> 0:4:22,83
I started a long time ago at Boston Consulting
Group. Boston Consulting Group is a strategy


41
0:4:22,83 --> 0:4:30,7
consulting firm. They basically built their
reputation on one chart, one visual aid, and


42
0:4:30,7 --> 0:4:36,72
it was called the Experience Curve. What the
Experience Curve did was describe how performance


43
0:4:36,72 --> 0:4:41,7
improves, and it started by looking at the
semiconductor industry, and looked at operating


44
0:4:41,7 --> 0:4:47,35
performance improvement in the semiconductor
industry over many, many years, and it had


45
0:4:47,35 --> 0:4:53,8
a very distinctive pattern to it, and over
the years BCG applied this analysis to industry


46
0:4:53,8 --> 0:5:0,54
after industry everything from Japanese beer
to toilet paper. All of it follows the experience


47
0:5:0,54 --> 0:5:6,7
curve as a way of describing how performance
improves in markets and industries. So it


48
0:5:6,7 --> 0:5:13,88
s a very accurate description of performance
improvement, but it has one distinctive characteristic,


49
0:5:13,88 --> 0:5:20,1
which I think is important to highlight here,
which is it s a diminishing returns curve.


50
0:5:20,1 --> 0:5:26,7
The more experience you accumulate in a marketer
industry, the longer and harder you have to


51
0:5:26,7 --> 0:5:32,73
work to get the next increment of performance
improvement. It may help to explain why many


52
0:5:32,73 --> 0:5:39,4
of us are feeling increasing stress in the
markets and industries that we operate in.


53
0:5:39,4 --> 0:5:45,27
But what if there were an alternative? What
if we could turn the experience curve on its


54
0:5:45,27 --> 0:5:55,61
side and generate increasing returns, rather
than diminishing returns? What if performance


55
0:5:55,61 --> 0:6:4,64
improvement accelerated as the number of participants
expands? Now that would be powerful, but what


56
0:6:4,64 --> 0:6:11,43
would it require? Well, I suggest it requires
a lot of things, and it starts with a major


57
0:6:11,43 --> 0:6:18,24
shift in our beliefs and our practices. It
s a key dimension of what we ve described


58
0:6:18,24 --> 0:6:24,12
in The Power of Pull as the big shift, and
as a result, I think it requires a shift in


59
0:6:24,12 --> 0:6:31,8
design focus so let me amplify a bit on that,
and when I talk about shift in beliefs, I


60
0:6:31,8 --> 0:6:40,63
m talking about a shift in our view of where
and how economic value gets created. The shorthand


61
0:6:40,63 --> 0:6:45,64
way we have of capturing that is saying we
re moving from a world of stocks to a world


62
0:6:45,64 --> 0:6:51,7
of flows. And what do I mean by that? Well,
I m referring in this case not to stocks that


63
0:6:51,7 --> 0:6:57,2
are traded on the stock market, but knowledge
stocks, what we know at any point in time,


64
0:6:57,2 --> 0:7:1,75
and it turns out if you ask any executive
and really probe as to their basic beliefs


65
0:7:1,75 --> 0:7:7,83
of what s created economic value, the basic
assumption is, first of all, you have to acquire


66
0:7:7,83 --> 0:7:13,18
some proprietary knowledge stocks, and then
you have to, aggressively as possible, protect


67
0:7:13,18 --> 0:7:18,21
those knowledge stocks from anybody else getting
access to them, and then as efficiently as


68
0:7:18,21 --> 0:7:25,36
possible, extract the value from those knowledge
stocks. Huge corporations were created in


69
0:7:25,36 --> 0:7:30,77
the 20th Century around this set of beliefs.
Enormous wealth generated around this set


70
0:7:30,77 --> 0:7:37,41
of beliefs. We make the case that, in fact,
we re shifting from a world of knowledge stocks


71
0:7:37,41 --> 0:7:41,62
to a world of knowledge flows, and the reason
for that is, if you think about it, anything


72
0:7:41,62 --> 0:7:51,91
you know today has more and more rapidly depreciating
value. What we know today has a very limited


73
0:7:51,91 --> 0:7:57,73
shelf life. The shelf life is shrinking over
time, and the only way you can create economic


74
0:7:57,73 --> 0:8:4,18
value in that kind of environment is to find
ways to more effectively participate in a


75
0:8:4,18 --> 0:8:10,77
larger number of more diverse knowledge flows
so that you can refresh those knowledge stocks


76
0:8:10,77 --> 0:8:17,79
at an accelerating rate. Fundamentally different
view of what s required to create economic


77
0:8:17,79 --> 0:8:23,45
value. Now in this context I m actually very
intrigued. I ve just recently encountered


78
0:8:23,45 --> 0:8:29,9
a set of design theories that are known as
constructal design theories generated by two


79
0:8:29,9 --> 0:8:36,309
people: Adrian Bejan and Sylvie Laurent, and
what they ve done is they ve built a design


80
0:8:36,309 --> 0:8:42,509
perspective based on what they call a constructal
law that they ve observed now in playing out


81
0:8:42,509 --> 0:8:50,23
across physical environments, biological environments
and social systems. And essentially what the


82
0:8:50,23 --> 0:8:57,35
constructal law says is that in order to survive,
systems have to evolve greater and greater


83
0:8:57,35 --> 0:9:8,209
access to the currents that flow through them.
Whether we re talking about riverbeds, trees,


84
0:9:8,209 --> 0:9:16,86
the design of our lungs or our cities, it
turns out they all obey this constructal law.


85
0:9:16,86 --> 0:9:23,5
Systems that survive and thrive are those
that evolve most rapidly and effectively to


86
0:9:23,5 --> 0:9:30,209
enhance those flows within those systems.
So I think two interesting implications from


87
0:9:30,209 --> 0:9:38,579
this perspective: one is that the whole emphasis
on system design is on enhancing flows. That


88
0:9:38,579 --> 0:9:43,759
really is the mark of a successful system
and experience within the system, and it s


89
0:9:43,759 --> 0:9:48,48
also an emphasis on evolving systems, not
static systems because the emphasis here is


90
0:9:48,48 --> 0:9:52,779
these systems are continually evolving, and
if they re not they re in trouble, and they


91
0:9:52,779 --> 0:9:57,72
re continuing evolving along a certain pattern,
which is how do you more effectively generate


92
0:9:57,72 --> 0:10:5,399
and support the flows within the system. So
what would it mean to design the systems we


93
0:10:5,399 --> 0:10:11,4
live and work in to continually evolve our
ability to experience more and more flow,


94
0:10:11,4 --> 0:10:23,189
especially the flow of people and of ideas?
So that s one shift: the shift in beliefs


95
0:10:23,189 --> 0:10:30,199
from stocks to flows. There s a corollary
to this, which is a shift in practices. If


96
0:10:30,199 --> 0:10:34,48
they were fundamentally changing in terms
of where the source of economic value is,


97
0:10:34,48 --> 0:10:39,529
it stands to reason that the practices we
use to create economic value are going to


98
0:10:39,529 --> 0:10:44,68
have to change in a significant way as well,
and the way we capture this is the notion


99
0:10:44,68 --> 0:10:52,8
of moving from a world of push to a world
of pull. Again, if you go back in time to


100
0:10:52,8 --> 0:10:58,869
the 20th Century, the large companies that
succeeded in the 20th Century were operating


101
0:10:58,869 --> 0:11:5,249
on a push model. Basically said the key is
to forecast and predict demand, and then make


102
0:11:5,249 --> 0:11:10,129
sure that all the right people and resources
are in the right place at the right time to


103
0:11:10,129 --> 0:11:16,43
meet that demand. Again, huge multinational
corporations created with this push model,


104
0:11:16,43 --> 0:11:22,809
enormous wealth created. On the other hand,
if we re living in a more uncertain and more


105
0:11:22,809 --> 0:11:28,639
rapidly changing world, that kind of push
model becomes more and more challenging, more


106
0:11:28,639 --> 0:11:33,36
and more problematic, and the questions is
then, well, what s the replacement? What s


107
0:11:33,36 --> 0:11:39,369
the option? Well, we argue that it s all about
pull practices. Now many of you, when I say


108
0:11:39,369 --> 0:11:44,209
pull, are going to have a certain mindset
or image of what I mean by pull. I want to


109
0:11:44,209 --> 0:11:49,779
kind of expand that, hopefully. I think it
probably expands by talking about three levels


110
0:11:49,779 --> 0:11:55,689
of pull that are becoming increasingly important.
There s one level, which is probably the most


111
0:11:55,689 --> 0:12:2,459
obvious, which I call access. It s simply
the notion of how do I more effectively access


112
0:12:2,459 --> 0:12:7,74
people and resources when I need them or where
I need them? It s basic search functionality


113
0:12:7,74 --> 0:12:13,249
that Google offers. It s the shift from push-based
media to pull-based media so you can pull


114
0:12:13,249 --> 0:12:19,66
the media you want, experience at any point
in time wherever you want it. Now that s a


115
0:12:19,66 --> 0:12:25,449
powerful of pull, but it s just the first
level. I haven t even begun to tap into the


116
0:12:25,449 --> 0:12:30,29
opportunity around pull, which comes starting
with the second level, which is the notion


117
0:12:30,29 --> 0:12:36,72
of attraction. Here s the challenge: In a
world that s more rapidly changing, you don


118
0:12:36,72 --> 0:12:44,17
t even know what to look for, what questions
to ask, what to search for. The only way you


119
0:12:44,17 --> 0:12:50,139
re going to survive and thrive in that kind
of world is by attracting people and resources


120
0:12:50,139 --> 0:12:56,949
to you that you never even knew existed, and
we ve all had the experience of serendipity


121
0:12:56,949 --> 0:13:2,19
an unexpected encounter. You run into somebody.
You start up a conversation. Start talking


122
0:13:2,19 --> 0:13:5,709
about some of the issues you re dealing with,
and my God, they offer some insight that you


123
0:13:5,709 --> 0:13:14,29
d been struggling with for months. Enormously
valuable opportunities. Now when I talk about


124
0:13:14,29 --> 0:13:19,29
serendipity, most people respond, Yeah, but
that s pure luck. Now there s nothing you


125
0:13:19,29 --> 0:13:23,42
can do about serendipity. It just happens.
All you can do is be prepared for it when


126
0:13:23,42 --> 0:13:32,4
it does happen. Well, in fact, we make a very
strong case that you can shape serendipity.


127
0:13:32,4 --> 0:13:39,769
You can increase both the probability and
the quality of those unexpected encounters


128
0:13:39,769 --> 0:13:46,869
by making choices about where you spend your
time and how you spend your time. Significant


129
0:13:46,869 --> 0:13:55,119
potential to affect that serendipity, that
ability to pull that second level of pull,


130
0:13:55,119 --> 0:13:59,209
but there s a third level that s even more
interesting, and this is the one I focus on


131
0:13:59,209 --> 0:14:5,129
in the context of this discussion around design
challenges and opportunities. The third level


132
0:14:5,129 --> 0:14:11,89
of pull is what I call achieve. It s the notion
of pulling out of each of us, and out of the


133
0:14:11,89 --> 0:14:19,189
institutions we work in the full potential
that resides within us and within those institutions.


134
0:14:19,189 --> 0:14:25,22
It gets to the notion of learning, more rapid
learning, more rapid performance improvement


135
0:14:25,22 --> 0:14:31,379
by using those first two levels of pull and
adding some additional elements on top. That


136
0:14:31,379 --> 0:14:38,73
s where the real power of pull comes in, is
if you can tap into that in a world of increasing


137
0:14:38,73 --> 0:14:44,959
pressure, that s the opportunity to shift
from diminishing returns to increasing returns.


138
0:14:44,959 --> 0:14:53,509
But the key question is how do you design
systems and experiences that provide us with


139
0:14:53,509 --> 0:15:1,319
those scalable pull experiences? It s not
just with a few friends or coworkers, but


140
0:15:1,319 --> 0:15:7,17
to really be successful we talk about the
notion of scalable pull. How do you do this


141
0:15:7,17 --> 0:15:16,519
in a global basis where you can draw out people
and resources, not just in your local workplace,


142
0:15:16,519 --> 0:15:25,189
but around the world, wherever they reside?
Now I confess I don t have the answers to


143
0:15:25,189 --> 0:15:30,269
these questions that I m posing. I don t think
anyone does at this point. That s partly why


144
0:15:30,269 --> 0:15:35,54
I think they re such interesting questions,
but I m hoping to intrigue and tease enough


145
0:15:35,54 --> 0:15:45,459
of you that you ll start to come up with the
answers to the questions, and I don t have


146
0:15:45,459 --> 0:15:50,809
the answers, but I think I can frame some
of the questions that need to be answered,


147
0:15:50,809 --> 0:15:57,499
and in particular I want to focus on two dimensions
of the design challenge: one having to do


148
0:15:57,499 --> 0:16:4,579
with platforms and the other having to do
with pathways, and I think they re both important.


149
0:16:4,579 --> 0:16:11,36
In fact, one without the other becomes not
very interesting. s what are the platform


150
0:16:11,36 --> 0:16:17,929
designs that would accelerate scalable peer-to-peer
learning? How would you think about a scalable


151
0:16:17,929 --> 0:16:25,29
platform to do that? What are the design elements?
And then how can we design the pathways that


152
0:16:25,29 --> 0:16:30,47
will help us get pragmatically from where
we are today, which is nowhere near scalable


153
0:16:30,47 --> 0:16:40,699
pull platforms, to that big opportunity that
s out there? So let me just spend a minute


154
0:16:40,699 --> 0:16:47,49
on the notion of platform designs. What would
platform designs have to do? We all know that


155
0:16:47,49 --> 0:16:54,79
teams are incredibly rich environments for
accelerated peer-to-peer learning. If you


156
0:16:54,79 --> 0:17:1,279
re a part of a high-performing team, you re
going to learn very rapidly and dramatically


157
0:17:1,279 --> 0:17:9,66
improve your own performance in the process,
but there s a big challenge with teams. Teams


158
0:17:9,66 --> 0:17:16,14
don t scale. As soon as teams get to a certain
size, they begin to disintegrate. They begin


159
0:17:16,14 --> 0:17:23,94
to fall apart. So if you re looking for scalable
pull in the sense of more rapid performance


160
0:17:23,94 --> 0:17:28,87
improvement and learning, teams alone are
not the answer. They re part of the solution,


161
0:17:28,87 --> 0:17:37,24
but the question then becomes how do we embed
teams in increasingly rich platforms that


162
0:17:37,24 --> 0:17:44,81
scale by encouraging the formation of even
more teams, and also connect with and learn


163
0:17:44,81 --> 0:17:55,5
from each other across teams? That begins
to look like a scalable pull platform. Now,


164
0:17:55,5 --> 0:18:2,49
as Brandon mentioned, I look for early instances
of some of these things in action, and so


165
0:18:2,49 --> 0:18:8,7
I want to share a couple of examples of the
opportunity that s playing out in some domains


166
0:18:8,7 --> 0:18:14,42
that are not very central to business, but
I think the opportunity is to learn from those


167
0:18:14,42 --> 0:18:22,56
environments and apply design principles into
business. So one example of where some of


168
0:18:22,56 --> 0:18:29,36
this scalable pull platform is emerging is
online in a video game that most of you, many


169
0:18:29,36 --> 0:18:35,71
of you at least, may be familiar with called
World of Warcraft. It has 12 million participants


170
0:18:35,71 --> 0:18:43,82
on a global scale 12 million and it s rapidly
growing, continuing to grow. Most of those


171
0:18:43,82 --> 0:18:50,39
12 million participants are organized into
high-performing teams. If they re richly connected


172
0:18:50,39 --> 0:18:57,95
across teams, they call them Gills. Through
rich networks of discussion forums, video


173
0:18:57,95 --> 0:19:2,51
repositories, all kinds of resources that
can help the members of these teams learn,


174
0:19:2,51 --> 0:19:9,85
not just within the team, but across teams,
very interesting network layered on top of


175
0:19:9,85 --> 0:19:16,57
teams to make them even more successful. There
s another example that we ve spent a fair


176
0:19:16,57 --> 0:19:23,33
amount of time with and we talk about in the
book, which is extreme sports. In particular


177
0:19:23,33 --> 0:19:28,32
we ve spent a lot of time looking at big wave
surfing as an area of extreme performance


178
0:19:28,32 --> 0:19:35,17
improvement, and it turns out big wave surfers,
by definition, are very much tied to local


179
0:19:35,17 --> 0:19:41,8
physical environments. They re not on the
Internet playing games. They re on surf breaks


180
0:19:41,8 --> 0:19:46,39
wrestling with very, very challenging waves
as they come. So they re deeply grounded in


181
0:19:46,39 --> 0:19:51,77
their physical environment, but the scalability
of the learning comes from the opportunity


182
0:19:51,77 --> 0:19:58,48
to layer on top of that physical experience
participation in virtual environments, and


183
0:19:58,48 --> 0:20:3,27
again, learning from each other regardless
of where these surfers are located. South


184
0:20:3,27 --> 0:20:10,5
African surfers communicating with Australian
surfers communicating with Hawaiian surfers,


185
0:20:10,5 --> 0:20:15,9
all of them using the same kinds of facilities
discussion forums, video repositories. They


186
0:20:15,9 --> 0:20:21,66
study videos of each other to learn the practices
that are emerging in different local areas,


187
0:20:21,66 --> 0:20:30,85
and the social relationships that have emerged
around those exchanges of information. So


188
0:20:30,85 --> 0:20:36,26
those are a couple of interesting examples
of the kinds of platforms that are emerging


189
0:20:36,26 --> 0:20:41,93
that create scalable pull in the sense of
learning opportunities, more rapid learning,


190
0:20:41,93 --> 0:20:48,77
more rapid performance improvement as more
participants join in. Really interesting opportunity


191
0:20:48,77 --> 0:20:55,23
in a business context. I mentioned there was
a second design challenge, though, which is


192
0:20:55,23 --> 0:21:0,16
not just the platforms. It has to do with
the pathways. Anybody who starts talking about


193
0:21:0,16 --> 0:21:4,62
these kinds of scalable pull platforms in
front of an executive is going to get a bleary


194
0:21:4,62 --> 0:21:10,87
look on the face and say, Well, wait a minute.
I m over here. You re talking about something


195
0:21:10,87 --> 0:21:15,43
that s way out there. How they hell am I going
to get out there? So if you don t design a


196
0:21:15,43 --> 0:21:21,93
pathway that helps people to move in a pragmatic
way from where they are today to where they


197
0:21:21,93 --> 0:21:29,52
need to be, it s going to be a very short
conversation. So in that context I want to


198
0:21:29,52 --> 0:21:34,88
tell a bit of a story around a company that
we found very interesting in the context of


199
0:21:34,88 --> 0:21:41,29
pull. It s a company I think most of you are
probably familiar with. It s in the software


200
0:21:41,29 --> 0:21:49,99
business and it s called SAP. SAP was at one
time a highly entrepreneurial company. The


201
0:21:49,99 --> 0:21:56,19
founder of it, Hasso Plattner, amazing guy,
very curmudgeonly guy, very passionate about


202
0:21:56,19 --> 0:22:3,1
the software technology and work that he did.
He became more and more concerned as his company


203
0:22:3,1 --> 0:22:8,98
grew and scaled because, as it grew and scaled,
it started to take on more and more of the


204
0:22:8,98 --> 0:22:16,27
kind of bureaucratic tradition-bound risk
averse, not invented here kinds of cultures


205
0:22:16,27 --> 0:22:24,52
that many of us are familiar with in large
companies. So he said, ve got to change this.


206
0:22:24,52 --> 0:22:31,29
And what he did was he went out and he bought
a company, and he bought the company not particularly


207
0:22:31,29 --> 0:22:35,82
because the company was great, but because
he wanted the guy who was the founder of that


208
0:22:35,82 --> 0:22:41,73
company. It was a guy by the name of Shai
Agassi. Not many of you may be familiar with


209
0:22:41,73 --> 0:22:48,32
Shai. He made Shai a very senior executive
of SAP, but he said, m not going to put you


210
0:22:48,32 --> 0:22:52,73
in charge of the core part of my business
because if I do they re going to kill you


211
0:22:52,73 --> 0:22:59,68
over there, and you re a really nice guy.
I don t want to see you killed. So what I


212
0:22:59,68 --> 0:23:4,63
m going to do is I m going to put you in charge
of a part of the business that s on the edge.


213
0:23:4,63 --> 0:23:9,79
It s a new product that we re introducing
called NetWeaver. It s generating a very limited


214
0:23:9,79 --> 0:23:16,27
amount of revenue and no profit so nobody
is going to pay attention to it over in the


215
0:23:16,27 --> 0:23:20,16
core of the business. You ll have degrees
of freedom out there that you wouldn t have


216
0:23:20,16 --> 0:23:25,52
if you were in the core, and he said, I want
you to use that platform as an opportunity


217
0:23:25,52 --> 0:23:32,2
to redefine how we work together and how we
can get to more accelerated performance improvement.


218
0:23:32,2 --> 0:23:42,7
What Shai did was he created a platform called
the SAP Developer Network, and initially it


219
0:23:42,7 --> 0:23:46,93
was a very simple platform. It basically was
an environment you could come into, an online


220
0:23:46,93 --> 0:23:52,58
environment, where if you were a developer
working on this NetWeaver product and running


221
0:23:52,58 --> 0:23:59,17
into programming issues, as many people would,
you could pose the question and see if anybody


222
0:23:59,17 --> 0:24:4,62
else had had an experience that was equivalent
could help you work your way through the problem


223
0:24:4,62 --> 0:24:14,4
you were wrestling with. Really simple. Basically
a discussion forum, but incredibly powerful.


224
0:24:14,4 --> 0:24:21,48
And it turns out now SAP Developer Network
has about two million software developers


225
0:24:21,48 --> 0:24:27,69
actively participating on this network, and
again, it s growing at a very rapid rate.


226
0:24:27,69 --> 0:24:36,74
It s scaling. And it has generated enormous
productivity on the part of these software


227
0:24:36,74 --> 0:24:42,24
developers, and the initial focus of the platform
was actually software developers outside of


228
0:24:42,24 --> 0:24:48,85
SAP. It was software developers in third-party
channels, software developers in the customers,


229
0:24:48,85 --> 0:24:54,96
not the SAP developers because the SAP developers
had this mindset that how can you possibly


230
0:24:54,96 --> 0:24:59,84
learn from anybody outside our company. You
know, we re an incredibly successful company.


231
0:24:59,84 --> 0:25:5,99
Well, it turns out over time more and more
of the SAP developers have migrated out into


232
0:25:5,99 --> 0:25:11,58
this developer network because word has spread
that it s an amazing productivity tool. You


233
0:25:11,58 --> 0:25:16,99
can develop more rapidly, learn more quickly
as part of this network than you ever could


234
0:25:16,99 --> 0:25:25,45
working on your own or working as part of
your local team. So very interesting progression


235
0:25:25,45 --> 0:25:32,28
over time. I tell the story because I think
it illustrates a number of elements of pathways


236
0:25:32,28 --> 0:25:40,28
that are going to be important to realizing
this opportunity to create scalable pull platforms.


237
0:25:40,28 --> 0:25:48,9
One of the pathways is the notion of starting
with a very simple transaction in these environments.


238
0:25:48,9 --> 0:25:54,56
There s often a temptation to go out with
very elaborate kind of learning environments


239
0:25:54,56 --> 0:26:0,19
and performance improvement environments.
This was a simple question and answer discussion


240
0:26:0,19 --> 0:26:8,72
forum: Pose the problem. See if anybody else
has an answer to it, and then move to using


241
0:26:8,72 --> 0:26:15,52
that to build reputation and relationships.
What happened was that as people started answering


242
0:26:15,52 --> 0:26:22,57
the problems, they developed a reputation.
They actually got points. SAP awarded them


243
0:26:22,57 --> 0:26:28,69
points for each successful answer that was
delivered, and they built a reputation around


244
0:26:28,69 --> 0:26:34,36
those points. Interesting sidelight, it turns
out that a lot of software recruiters had


245
0:26:34,36 --> 0:26:40,15
figured out that if you re looking for a software
developer with real talent in certain areas,


246
0:26:40,15 --> 0:26:45,82
go into the SAP Developer Network and look
at those reputation profiles, and you ll find


247
0:26:45,82 --> 0:26:51,6
people who are really successful at answering
some really challenging problems. So it turns


248
0:26:51,6 --> 0:26:56,51
out even though those people offering answers
were not getting any monetary reward directly


249
0:26:56,51 --> 0:27:1,85
for their answers, they were getting some
more and more attractive job offers as a result


250
0:27:1,85 --> 0:27:8,55
of having done that. More motivation to contribute
even more. And by the way, I should say at


251
0:27:8,55 --> 0:27:14,99
this point the average time to answer a problem
that s provided on the SAP Developer Network


252
0:27:14,99 --> 0:27:22,57
is about 17 minutes from the time it s posed
to the time the problem is resolved 17 minutes.


253
0:27:22,57 --> 0:27:27,89
So it s a very, very successful platform in
that regard. But what s happened is then you


254
0:27:27,89 --> 0:27:34,38
ve got a third level of progression and evolution,
which is the notion that over time, as a result


255
0:27:34,38 --> 0:27:39,16
of this reputation and the relationships that
emerge, because people were seeking each other


256
0:27:39,16 --> 0:27:45,76
out as they saw each other s reputation in
certain areas, teams stated to form and took


257
0:27:45,76 --> 0:27:51,16
on more and more challenging application development
initiatives, not just solving a problem with


258
0:27:51,16 --> 0:27:58,45
their current coding efforts, but actually
came together from around the world to develop


259
0:27:58,45 --> 0:28:3,22
entirely new applications, again, based on
the reputation and relationships that they


260
0:28:3,22 --> 0:28:11,96
had built as part of this environment. So
it s an interesting progression. It says start


261
0:28:11,96 --> 0:28:17,54
with very simple kinds of transactions and
build on that over time so you get these relationships


262
0:28:17,54 --> 0:28:25,86
emerging and more interesting learning environments
begin to surface over time. There s a second


263
0:28:25,86 --> 0:28:31,65
dimension to the pathway, which is that the
model that Shai used here, as an entrepreneur


264
0:28:31,65 --> 0:28:38,25
in the software industry, he was a big proponent
of rapid iteration of software development,


265
0:28:38,25 --> 0:28:44,66
and so the notion of deploying this network
in very short increments, getting it out there,


266
0:28:44,66 --> 0:28:49,82
watching how people behaved on these networks
and what kinds of things were working, what


267
0:28:49,82 --> 0:28:57,59
wasn t, and then doing another iteration based
on that was a very powerful way to learn from


268
0:28:57,59 --> 0:29:2,75
the participants and not simply spend a ton
of money upfront trying to figure out what


269
0:29:2,75 --> 0:29:9,7
they would need. So that s a second dimension.
A third dimension is this notion of starting


270
0:29:9,7 --> 0:29:16,59
on the edge. You know, there s a big question
of how do you get change to happen. If we


271
0:29:16,59 --> 0:29:22,7
re talking about scalable pull platforms with
large enterprises, that s really hard to accomplish


272
0:29:22,7 --> 0:29:28,5
given the deeply held beliefs and practices
that drive the core. Most of the cores of


273
0:29:28,5 --> 0:29:36,43
our companies are push-based cores, and so
the notion of not trying to change the core,


274
0:29:36,43 --> 0:29:42,27
but going out to an interesting edge and driving
change from the edge, and by the way, not


275
0:29:42,27 --> 0:29:48,61
bringing that edge back into the core. So
they would have killed the developer network


276
0:29:48,61 --> 0:29:53,82
if they tried to bring it back into the core.
What they were doing was creating more and


277
0:29:53,82 --> 0:30:0,19
more incentive and motivation to pull more
and more of the people in the core and resources


278
0:30:0,19 --> 0:30:6,4
in the core out to the edge and scale the
edge even more rapidly around a very different


279
0:30:6,4 --> 0:30:14,47
set of practices than had prevailed within
SAP at the time. There s another dimension


280
0:30:14,47 --> 0:30:22,3
of the pathway which I think becomes extremely
important to drive the movement, and that


281
0:30:22,3 --> 0:30:28,7
s the notion of performance metrics to measure
progress, and I think what s particularly


282
0:30:28,7 --> 0:30:32,69
interesting about this opportunity for more
rapid performance improvement is it almost


283
0:30:32,69 --> 0:30:39,33
by definition suggests a set of metrics to
say how are we doing. Is performance actually


284
0:30:39,33 --> 0:30:46,17
improving as a result of participation on
these platforms? And what can we learn from


285
0:30:46,17 --> 0:30:50,43
either the fact that it s improving very,
very rapidly or not improving as much as we


286
0:30:50,43 --> 0:30:56,61
d like? How would we tweak it so that we can
actually get more rapid performance improvement?


287
0:30:56,61 --> 0:31:2,36
So it involves really focusing on what are
people trying to get better at in these environments?


288
0:31:2,36 --> 0:31:8,48
What is the performance improvement goal or
objective? And how would you measure progress


289
0:31:8,48 --> 0:31:12,55
in the performance improvement? So at this
point it s not just the learning. You can


290
0:31:12,55 --> 0:31:17,32
t measure learning directly, but you can measure
the outcome from the learning, which ought


291
0:31:17,32 --> 0:31:25,6
to be performance improvement in whatever
domain. SAP was relentless in measuring this


292
0:31:25,6 --> 0:31:32,43
notion of time from question posed to answer
received as a measure of performance improvement


293
0:31:32,43 --> 0:31:42,57
within this network. And then, finally, there
s a fifth dimension of the pathway, which


294
0:31:42,57 --> 0:31:50,75
is building passion, and I think if anybody
is trying to design an environment and set


295
0:31:50,75 --> 0:31:57,44
of experiences to drive more rapid performance
improvement and more rapid learning, you ultimately


296
0:31:57,44 --> 0:32:9,44
need to focus on how do you build, generate,
catalyze, nurture passion among the participants.


297
0:32:9,44 --> 0:32:15,3
The key participants in the SAP Developer
Network are deeply passionate about the work


298
0:32:15,3 --> 0:32:22,89
they re doing on that network. They re not
doing this just because there s monetary opportunity.


299
0:32:22,89 --> 0:32:27,73
They are intrinsically engaged in what they
re doing, and having an impact with what they


300
0:32:27,73 --> 0:32:32,3
re doing and having an impact with a broader
and broader range of people with what they


301
0:32:32,3 --> 0:32:42,92
re doing. There is real passion. So if we
get it right I think there s really significant


302
0:32:42,92 --> 0:32:49,26
opportunity, but I don t want to just position
this as an opportunity. I m going to suggest


303
0:32:49,26 --> 0:32:56,2
that the reason I m optimistic this challenge
is going to be addressed is because it s an


304
0:32:56,2 --> 0:33:0,96
imperative. It s not just an opportunity.
We re going to have to do this. It s not a


305
0:33:0,96 --> 0:33:6,48
choice. It s not something that s nice to
have if we have some budget left over. It


306
0:33:6,48 --> 0:33:14,23
s essential to succeed in an increasingly
competitive business world. Why do I say that?


307
0:33:14,23 --> 0:33:23,12
Well, one of the things that we talk about
in our research for The Power of Pull is we


308
0:33:23,12 --> 0:33:30,2
asked a fairly simple question, which we thought
had been certainly asked and probably answered,


309
0:33:30,2 --> 0:33:37,48
which was just a question of how are we doing
as companies. How are companies doing? Not


310
0:33:37,48 --> 0:33:43,42
just in the most recent quarter or the past
year, but over a long period of time. How


311
0:33:43,42 --> 0:33:51,1
are companies doing? To our surprise, perhaps
not so much shouldn t have been a surprise


312
0:33:51,1 --> 0:33:56,26
given the very short-term focus we increasingly
all have, that question, to our knowledge,


313
0:33:56,26 --> 0:34:3,63
had never been asked, much less answered.
So what we ended up doing was looking at all


314
0:34:3,63 --> 0:34:10,419
public companies in the United States, not
just a sample, but every single public company,


315
0:34:10,419 --> 0:34:17,7
and we looked at it over a long period of
time. We went back to 1965 to today, and we


316
0:34:17,7 --> 0:34:22,0
asked the question, how are they doing? Now
to measure performance, and this may be a


317
0:34:22,0 --> 0:34:27,7
bit controversial, and we can certainly talk
about the pros and cons, we ended up focusing


318
0:34:27,7 --> 0:34:36,75
on return on assets as our measure of performance.
It turns out if you look at return on assets


319
0:34:36,75 --> 0:34:43,71
for all public companies in the U.S. since
1965 to today return on assets has collapsed.


320
0:34:43,71 --> 0:34:53,98
It s collapsed by 75 percent over that time
period. It s a sustained erosion. There is


321
0:34:53,98 --> 0:35:3,4
no sign of it leveling off. There s absolutely
no sign of it turning around. So I think it


322
0:35:3,4 --> 0:35:8,0
suggests that the management practices and
the management institutions we have today


323
0:35:8,0 --> 0:35:15,53
are fundamentally broken, and if we don t
crack this opportunity around more rapid performance


324
0:35:15,53 --> 0:35:19,44
improvement and more rapid learning, these
companies are going to go out of business.


325
0:35:19,44 --> 0:35:26,97
And when I go into corporate boardrooms these
days, I m struck by how often, how frequently


326
0:35:26,97 --> 0:35:33,58
I hear the metaphor or the image of the Red
Queen from Alice in Wonderland. You know,


327
0:35:33,58 --> 0:35:41,7
executives talk about feeling the Red Queen
Effect. And I actually push back on that and


328
0:35:41,7 --> 0:35:48,24
I make the case that the Red Queen actually
had it pretty good. The Red Queen ran faster


329
0:35:48,24 --> 0:35:55,34
and faster and she stayed in the same place.
We re running faster and faster and falling


330
0:35:55,34 --> 0:36:1,26
farther and farther behind so I think the
Red Queen actually had it much better than


331
0:36:1,26 --> 0:36:9,1
we do. So I don t think we have a choice about
this. I think this is becoming more and more


332
0:36:9,1 --> 0:36:14,26
of an imperative. If we don t figure out how
to learn faster and how to accelerate performance


333
0:36:14,26 --> 0:36:18,85
improvement, and how to go from that diminishing
returns environment to an increasing returns


334
0:36:18,85 --> 0:36:26,51
environment we re going out of business. Return
on assets, by the way, if you just follow


335
0:36:26,51 --> 0:36:31,28
the current trend line, which, again, has
been playing out for 40-plus years, reaches


336
0:36:31,28 --> 0:36:41,42
zero somewhere around 2022 so that s not a
sustainable outcome. Something will change


337
0:36:41,42 --> 0:36:52,43
over this next decade in order to address
that. So I want to end just by focusing on


338
0:36:52,43 --> 0:36:58,95
the opportunity. Again, I don t want to end
on a negative note. I come from Silicon Valley.


339
0:36:58,95 --> 0:37:5,49
We re inherent optimists. I mentioned earlier
that the opportunity here was this notion


340
0:37:5,49 --> 0:37:10,97
of increasing returns; that you get better
faster as more and more participants join


341
0:37:10,97 --> 0:37:14,97
in, and that s a real exciting and powerful
opportunity, but I think that s just the tip


342
0:37:14,97 --> 0:37:21,619
of the iceberg. The one thing that strikes
me when I hear discussions of increasing return


343
0:37:21,619 --> 0:37:27,23
is the classic example that people use to
illustrate increasing returns, is the fax


344
0:37:27,23 --> 0:37:32,66
machine, and that s the notion if you have
one fax machine it actually has negative value.


345
0:37:32,66 --> 0:37:37,56
You had to pay money to get it and you can
t do anything with it so it s actually a negative


346
0:37:37,56 --> 0:37:45,1
value. As more fax machines get added in and
connect to each other, the value goes up over


347
0:37:45,1 --> 0:37:52,23
time exponentially for all those fax machines.
But there s a really interesting element or


348
0:37:52,23 --> 0:37:59,49
detail in that story or in that example, and
that is that as fax machines increase in numbers


349
0:37:59,49 --> 0:38:4,84
they are not changing in terms of their basic
performance. It s simply a function of adding


350
0:38:4,84 --> 0:38:10,5
and connecting more fax machines together,
and that is a powerful form of increasing


351
0:38:10,5 --> 0:38:16,15
returns, but there s a second forum, which
is what if each of those fax machines were


352
0:38:16,15 --> 0:38:23,11
getting better in terms of their performance
and functionality, their design, by participating


353
0:38:23,11 --> 0:38:30,27
in this broader network. Then you get a second
increasing returns curve higher, steeper than


354
0:38:30,27 --> 0:38:38,64
the previous one. So it s a very significant
opportunity. I think that those of you who


355
0:38:38,64 --> 0:38:44,17
can take on this design challenge and can
crack the really difficult problems, I don


356
0:38:44,17 --> 0:38:50,6
t want to in any way trivialize the challenges
to creating these pull platforms are going


357
0:38:50,6 --> 0:39:0,19
to be on the edge of a whole new way of design
activity and practices. But one final thought


358
0:39:0,19 --> 0:39:7,2
just to kind of put this into an even broader
context is that rather than focusing on sustainability


359
0:39:7,2 --> 0:39:12,67
as a world, I think we should be taking on
an even greater challenge. It s something


360
0:39:12,67 --> 0:39:18,84
that a friend of mine, Jean Russell, calls
thrivability rather than sustainability. Sustainability


361
0:39:18,84 --> 0:39:26,32
has a notion of sustaining what we have. Thrivability
has a notion of how do we generate more and


362
0:39:26,32 --> 0:39:33,47
more sustainable prosperity from the limited
natural resources that our planet has been


363
0:39:33,47 --> 0:39:40,76
endowed with. So I don t think it s just our
business that depends on learning faster by


364
0:39:40,76 --> 0:39:48,61
working together, but it s our planet. It
s our entire world. If we don t figure out


365
0:39:48,61 --> 0:39:54,69
how to drive that kind of more rapid learning
and performance improvement, we re increasingly


366
0:39:54,69 --> 0:39:59,78
challenged as a planet. We either have to
be satisfied with less and less or we have


367
0:39:59,78 --> 0:40:9,609
to face the consequences of depleting resources
that are not replaceable. So I think we need


368
0:40:9,609 --> 0:40:17,26
to design these new experiences for all of
us, not just for the companies that we re


369
0:40:17,26 --> 0:40:30,19
in today. Thank you very much. Brandon Schauer:
So John has a little bit of time for some


370
0:40:30,19 --> 0:40:36,29
Q&A, and I want to kind of kick it off. I
think one of the challenges for this group


371
0:40:36,29 --> 0:40:43,22
is that we re poised between what we hear
from customers, what we see from customers.


372
0:40:43,22 --> 0:40:50,85
They being somewhat our platform for learning,
as well as the organization, and the organization


373
0:40:50,85 --> 0:40:58,42
representing much more of the core that we
re struggling with day in, day out. I think


374
0:40:58,42 --> 0:41:5,55
I can see examples from our industry where
one organization is moving ahead of another


375
0:41:5,55 --> 0:41:11,119
because of their ability to create a learning
platform with customers, as well as within


376
0:41:11,119 --> 0:41:18,6
the organization. I heard a talk about a year
ago by one of the creative directors at Electronic


377
0:41:18,6 --> 0:41:25,47
Arts. His story was of how they originally
started Madden football franchise interface


378
0:41:25,47 --> 0:41:32,21
based on what TV looks like, but then they
tested it with customers and found out people


379
0:41:32,21 --> 0:41:37,4
don t really like the way the television is
illustrating the experience of football for


380
0:41:37,4 --> 0:41:41,17
people. The scores were too big; they took
up too much of the screen. You couldn t really


381
0:41:41,17 --> 0:41:47,99
see the action, and so by passionately testing
and improving this interface, they were actually


382
0:41:47,99 --> 0:41:54,83
starting to see that football was following
the way Electronic Arts was presenting football


383
0:41:54,83 --> 0:42:2,4
through gaming because TV doesn t inter-test
necessarily or they don t do it in the same


384
0:42:2,4 --> 0:42:6,57
way. So we can see how one organization starts
to build another or beat out another if this


385
0:42:6,57 --> 0:42:16,79
case is TV versus gaming, but I guess my question
is, what have you found seem to be the linchpin


386
0:42:16,79 --> 0:42:21,17
ideas or changes that an organization can
take on to start moving towards this platform?


387
0:42:21,17 --> 0:42:27,39
One of them was going to the edge. Are there
others that we, as people who often are kind


388
0:42:27,39 --> 0:42:33,51
of the middle of the organization, trying
to push things forward? Are there other tactics


389
0:42:33,51 --> 0:42:39,75
we can start to employ? John Hagel III: Well,
it s a great question. I think that there


390
0:42:39,75 --> 0:42:43,73
are many different approaches, and they hinge
on the particular environments. I would say


391
0:42:43,73 --> 0:42:49,74
that one of the reasons I m optimistic is
I do think many companies, if not all, have


392
0:42:49,74 --> 0:42:58,51
kind of made this transition from a very narrow
product-centric view of their offers to much


393
0:42:58,51 --> 0:43:3,19
more of a sense that those products, if they
re going to be successful, have to be situated


394
0:43:3,19 --> 0:43:8,4
within a context in the customer, and that
you have to really kind of cross the table


395
0:43:8,4 --> 0:43:12,51
and understand what is the customer actually
trying to do with these products and services.


396
0:43:12,51 --> 0:43:19,369
What are they trying to accomplish with them?
And so broadening your horizon to look at


397
0:43:19,369 --> 0:43:25,9
the context, and I would say that if you ve
gone that far there s, I think, a logical


398
0:43:25,9 --> 0:43:35,67
next step, which is for most situations customers
are trying to use these products to get better


399
0:43:35,67 --> 0:43:40,369
at something else, something broader that
they re trying to do. What is that something


400
0:43:40,369 --> 0:43:48,54
better and how can you create design experiences?
And I think one of things, at least from my


401
0:43:48,54 --> 0:43:55,95
experience, is particularly important in this
context, and there is a barrier for many companies


402
0:43:55,95 --> 0:44:5,9
to address this, but too often companies think
about the user experiences, the mantra of


403
0:44:5,9 --> 0:44:12,69
one-to-one relationships, and increasingly
I think if you re really committed to helping


404
0:44:12,69 --> 0:44:21,19
customers get better faster using the products
and services that have been provided to them,


405
0:44:21,19 --> 0:44:26,27
and I hasten to add it s not just getting
better at using the product. It s getting


406
0:44:26,27 --> 0:44:35,22
better at whatever task or work they re trying
to do where this product fits into that experience.


407
0:44:35,22 --> 0:44:40,109
If you re really committed to doing that,
you re going to need to bring in other people,


408
0:44:40,109 --> 0:44:48,47
other participants, at least other customers,
and potentially other companies to be more


409
0:44:48,47 --> 0:44:54,69
helpful to those customers so that they can
get better faster using those products or


410
0:44:54,69 --> 0:45:1,84
services. So, again, I think one of the hooks
here is this notion of there s been a trajectory


411
0:45:1,84 --> 0:45:8,56
of progression. Understanding customer experiences
is broader than just the direct interaction


412
0:45:8,56 --> 0:45:14,92
with the product, and then taking it to that
next step of saying what if, and I think often


413
0:45:14,92 --> 0:45:21,77
I find the what if exercise is a pretty interesting
one to really put in tangible terms what would


414
0:45:21,77 --> 0:45:27,59
the opportunity be? What if the customers
could take our products and services and get


415
0:45:27,59 --> 0:45:33,39
better faster on a particular dimension? How
would that drive their continued purchase


416
0:45:33,39 --> 0:45:39,22
of our own products or the pace of adoption
of our products? And, by the way, that was


417
0:45:39,22 --> 0:45:45,24
one of the key metrics SAP used to measure
the progression here, was rate of customer


418
0:45:45,24 --> 0:45:51,119
adoption. As they deployed this developer
network, one of their key objectives, clearly,


419
0:45:51,119 --> 0:45:56,57
was to get more of the NetWeaver product into
the enterprise, and so that was a key measure


420
0:45:56,57 --> 0:46:3,19
and it was something that spoke to the very
traditional core executive if you could communicate


421
0:46:3,19 --> 0:46:10,35
in tangible terms that the pace of adoption
was going up, and show how the kind of interactions


422
0:46:10,35 --> 0:46:15,68
that were occurring on this developer network
most likely contributed to that, you got the


423
0:46:15,68 --> 0:46:22,5
attention of the core. That s something they
can relate to versus learning and relationships


424
0:46:22,5 --> 0:46:29,35
and these more qualitative kinds of terms.
Brandon Schauer: One last thing before I turn


425
0:46:29,35 --> 0:46:35,29
it on to the audience, why will push not work
in the new environment you see? John Hagel


426
0:46:35,29 --> 0:46:40,65
III: s not to say it won t ever work. I think
at the end of the day if you really pushed


427
0:46:40,65 --> 0:46:48,28
me on it I would say that everything we do
is some blend of push and pull technique so


428
0:46:48,28 --> 0:46:55,59
it s not to say push will completely disappear,
but I do think that in a world that is increasingly


429
0:46:55,59 --> 0:47:1,46
uncertain, and it s not just uncertain in
small ways. Many of you are familiar with


430
0:47:1,46 --> 0:47:7,7
Taleb s Black Swan concept. I think one of
the interesting consequences of a more connected


431
0:47:7,7 --> 0:47:13,2
world and a more competitive world, connection
and competition together actually produce


432
0:47:13,2 --> 0:47:18,619
some very interesting results. One of them
is extreme events, cascades that go out of


433
0:47:18,619 --> 0:47:28,78
control and go in ways we never would have
expected. Who would have expected Egypt, Tunisia


434
0:47:28,78 --> 0:47:36,99
would be but that s becoming more and more
frequent. So it s not just the small unexpected,


435
0:47:36,99 --> 0:47:41,34
We missed our forecast by 20 percent this
quarter. It s these eruptions, and if you


436
0:47:41,34 --> 0:47:45,92
have those kinds of eruptions, and you don
t have access to pull platforms where you


437
0:47:45,92 --> 0:47:53,31
can quickly adapt to those environments and
hopefully prosper in them, you re going to


438
0:47:53,31 --> 0:47:58,9
be increasingly challenged so I think that
s a key reason. Brandon Schauer: All right.


439
0:47:58,9 --> 0:48:4,5
Question from the audience? Audience Member::
You gave a framework access attraction achieve,


440
0:48:4,5 --> 0:48:23,34
and I was a little bit vague about that, and
then you gave the example of the developer


441
0:48:23,34 --> 0:48:26,27
network, but it resonated with me and I understood
it, and I wonder if you could just connect


442
0:48:26,27 --> 0:48:31,88
that framework to that example so that I can
get those pieces. John Hagel III: Great question.


443
0:48:31,88 --> 0:48:36,75
So access is simply one of the things they
had as part of the software developer network


444
0:48:36,75 --> 0:48:44,64
was a lot of kind of frequently asked questions
repositories. So you could access, you had


445
0:48:44,64 --> 0:48:49,23
a problem, you could go search through the
frequently asked questions and often get an


446
0:48:49,23 --> 0:48:59,9
answer to your question. Second level of attract
is much more this question of, as these reputations


447
0:48:59,9 --> 0:49:8,359
were being built on this network, people were
seeking out others in the network because


448
0:49:8,359 --> 0:49:16,5
of that reputation, and the person being approached
had no idea that these other people existed,


449
0:49:16,5 --> 0:49:20,3
much less that they had interests that were
kind of related to theirs and they started


450
0:49:20,3 --> 0:49:25,38
getting into really interesting discussions
and building relationships around that. So


451
0:49:25,38 --> 0:49:30,53
that was attraction. You re attracting people
that you never even knew existed as a result


452
0:49:30,53 --> 0:49:34,95
of the reputations that were being built and
the problem solving that you were doing for


453
0:49:34,95 --> 0:49:41,23
others. And then the third level is the notion
of achieve, pulling out our full potential,


454
0:49:41,23 --> 0:49:47,349
learning faster. I think what s happened over
time is this environment has become an extraordinarily


455
0:49:47,349 --> 0:49:52,619
rich learning environment. I mean the productivity
of the software developers has shot way up.


456
0:49:52,619 --> 0:49:57,45
That s the motivation for more and more of
these developers to join this network is because


457
0:49:57,45 --> 0:50:3,19
they know that anytime they run into a problem
they re going to get an answer pretty quickly,


458
0:50:3,19 --> 0:50:8,33
and they ll just be able to learn not only
from the answer, but move faster in terms


459
0:50:8,33 --> 0:50:12,84
of their coding and learn faster as a result
of that. They re learning faster because they


460
0:50:12,84 --> 0:50:17,8
re connecting with each other and engaging
in really interesting discussions around broader


461
0:50:17,8 --> 0:50:21,3
software development issues, and they re learning
faster because they re coming together in


462
0:50:21,3 --> 0:50:25,57
teams and actually working together to develop
new software now in ways they never would


463
0:50:25,57 --> 0:50:35,17
ve done in the past. So hopefully that helps
to clarify it a bit. Brandon Schauer: I think


464
0:50:35,17 --> 0:50:37,51
I saw another hand. Could you step by the
mic over here? Audience Member: So great talk.


465
0:50:37,51 --> 0:50:39,45
John Hagel III: Thank you. Audience Member:
And I have two questions: one is on a really


466
0:50:39,45 --> 0:50:53,27
small scale. I m curious about where you see
anonymity fitting into the pull model, and


467
0:50:53,27 --> 0:51:1,48
then the second question is do you have any
predictions and/or hopes for what you talked


468
0:51:1,48 --> 0:51:12,94
about? John Hagel III: A lot of hopes. I have
very few predictions. Who is it that said,


469
0:51:12,94 --> 0:51:17,48
s very hard to predict the future, especially
if it s in the future, or something like that?


470
0:51:17,48 --> 0:51:25,93
In any event, I think that your first question
was around anonymity, and I ve been involved


471
0:51:25,93 --> 0:51:31,3
in the online environment for a long time.
I actually wrote a book 15 years ago now I


472
0:51:31,3 --> 0:51:37,3
think on virtual community; it s called Net
Gain, and over that time period this whole


473
0:51:37,3 --> 0:51:44,43
question of anonymity versus identity has
really been a continuing discussion. I come


474
0:51:44,43 --> 0:51:50,13
from the camp that both are going to be appropriate
and relevant at different points in time.


475
0:51:50,13 --> 0:52:1,44
I do believe that over time there s more and
more value in persistent identity, being able


476
0:52:1,44 --> 0:52:11,92
to what s the right word? Being able to build
a reputation that is sustainable. Now you


477
0:52:11,92 --> 0:52:23,94
could do that with persistent anonymous identity,
an avatar, a made-up name. On the other hand


478
0:52:23,94 --> 0:52:28,91
I also am a strong believer that at the end
of the day the people who are going to learn


479
0:52:28,91 --> 0:52:34,34
fastest and improve performance most rapidly
are going to be those who find ways to connect


480
0:52:34,34 --> 0:52:40,2
with each other, not just in virtual environments,
but in physical environments, and it s going


481
0:52:40,2 --> 0:52:45,96
to be very hard to preserve anonymity if you
really believe you re going to end up having


482
0:52:45,96 --> 0:52:49,109
to actually engage in a physical space with
these people. I mean you could do it. I m


483
0:52:49,109 --> 0:52:58,21
not going to say it s impossible, but I do
think that that s more and more of an opportunity.


484
0:52:58,21 --> 0:53:7,51
So no predictions. My hopes, you know, obviously
I do think if we are able to harness this


485
0:53:7,51 --> 0:53:13,71
design challenge and create these environments
and experiences where people can learn faster,


486
0:53:13,71 --> 0:53:18,18
I think it has many different effects. I mean
I haven t had a chance to really talk about,


487
0:53:18,18 --> 0:53:24,0
for example, what s going on in Africa and
places like India using these kinds of environments


488
0:53:24,0 --> 0:53:29,84
where these very remote villagers are learning
from each other across villages and into the


489
0:53:29,84 --> 0:53:39,5
cities in ways that would have never been
possible before. I was at TED last week, and


490
0:53:39,5 --> 0:53:46,59
one of the speakers gave an incredible discussion
of what s going on in the favelas in Brazil


491
0:53:46,59 --> 0:53:51,26
in terms of connectivity, and actually there
s higher connectivity now in the favelas than


492
0:53:51,26 --> 0:53:57,3
there is in the more affluent parts of Brazil,
and it s precisely because these people recognize


493
0:53:57,3 --> 0:54:2,53
that by coming together and connecting they
re going to learn faster, and a huge motivation


494
0:54:2,53 --> 0:54:9,15
to do that. So I m very hopeful that it will
both broaden the access and prosperity that


495
0:54:9,15 --> 0:54:15,2
we ve achieved in certain parts of the globe,
and that ultimately it will help us to not


496
0:54:15,2 --> 0:54:21,23
just respond to the increasing pressure and
stress that we re all feeling, but actually


497
0:54:21,23 --> 0:54:33,42
help us to thrive and get to new levels of
rich experiences. So I m very hopeful at the


498
0:54:33,42 --> 0:54:41,55
end of the day. Audience Member: Thanks for
the great talk. Most of your examples are


499
0:54:41,55 --> 0:54:45,54
focused kind of within the organization. I
m wondering kind of within the enterprise


500
0:54:45,54 --> 0:54:51,8
or kind of businesses connecting, perhaps,
to one another, how you see pull working between


501
0:54:51,8 --> 0:54:58,47
businesses and their customers and how that
relationship has changed. John Hagel III:


502
0:54:58,47 --> 0:55:4,94
Actually, the primary example I gave, SAP,
was actually with customers and with third-party


503
0:55:4,94 --> 0:55:11,17
channels. That was the primary focus of the
SAP developer platform. It wasn t an internal


504
0:55:11,17 --> 0:55:15,98
platform, and I actually believe, going back
to the question of how do you get change to


505
0:55:15,98 --> 0:55:21,89
happen in large companies, it s easier to
change at the interface with the customer


506
0:55:21,89 --> 0:55:30,45
than internally. We have such rigid policies,
procedures, processes within the company,


507
0:55:30,45 --> 0:55:37,56
and customers, fortunately or unfortunately,
don t like rigid policies, procedures and


508
0:55:37,56 --> 0:55:42,849
processes so if we re going to be successful
in engaging with them and building deeper


509
0:55:42,849 --> 0:55:47,63
trust-based relationships with them, we re
going to have to figure this out, and so I


510
0:55:47,63 --> 0:55:53,64
believe it s going to get figured out first
at the customer interface and then be brought


511
0:55:53,64 --> 0:56:0,1
into other parts of the company, but that
is where the change will occur. And again,


512
0:56:0,1 --> 0:56:5,6
part of it is just the incredibly increasing
competitive pressure we re all facing in terms


513
0:56:5,6 --> 0:56:12,349
of how do we expand our relationships with
our customers and generate more revenue and


514
0:56:12,349 --> 0:56:22,18
profitability from them, and that that s the
economic driver that s going to make this


515
0:56:22,18 --> 0:56:29,589
work. Audience Member: So kind of going back
to the example that you were using at SAP,


516
0:56:29,589 --> 0:56:39,63
you talked about the access kind of being
the initial sort of core, and then as people


517
0:56:39,63 --> 0:56:44,79
participated and these reputations and so
forth, that it snowballed. So I have kind


518
0:56:44,79 --> 0:56:50,42
of two questions around that: one is what
kind of greases that wheel because conceptually


519
0:56:50,42 --> 0:56:54,97
it s easy to get your arms around, but until
you have the reputation how do you get the


520
0:56:54,97 --> 0:57:1,109
people to come? Was there an actually promotion
around that? Like how did they get that going?


521
0:57:1,109 --> 0:57:7,47
And the second is, in our litigious society
and how historically law has really been behind


522
0:57:7,47 --> 0:57:15,4
technology, how do we navigate that with liability.
We re in the healthcare industry and so there


523
0:57:15,4 --> 0:57:21,8
are a whole lot of issues around sharing and
learning and that kind of stuff. So I m interested


524
0:57:21,8 --> 0:57:27,27
in your thoughts on that. John Hagel III:
Yes. It s a great question. I think that in


525
0:57:27,27 --> 0:57:33,8
terms of how it gets going, again, it s hard
to generalize. In the SAP example it was this


526
0:57:33,8 --> 0:57:41,23
simple process of they took some very narrowly-defined
areas of the NetWeaver platform and created


527
0:57:41,23 --> 0:57:46,25
some discussion forums where people could
just come and ask a question, and so that


528
0:57:46,25 --> 0:57:51,82
was the starting point. One of the issues
you face with these kinds of platforms is


529
0:57:51,82 --> 0:57:56,98
the empty room problem. Right? You create
this discussion forum and you go in and ask


530
0:57:56,98 --> 0:58:2,13
a question. It s an echo chamber. Nobody there
to answer, to talk with you about it. So you


531
0:58:2,13 --> 0:58:9,27
got to be thoughtful, first of all, about
how you populate these arenas initially, potentially,


532
0:58:9,27 --> 0:58:15,46
with some people within the company, but some
lead customers who you ve identified or engaged


533
0:58:15,46 --> 0:58:21,25
with in other contexts; draw them in so that
they become part of the resource that can


534
0:58:21,25 --> 0:58:30,26
be drawn upon. And I just want to broaden
it a bit in the sense that I can t resist


535
0:58:30,26 --> 0:58:36,63
telling a story but one of the people we profiled
in the book, The Power of Pull, is a guy by


536
0:58:36,63 --> 0:58:44,66
the name of Yossi Vardi. Some of you may know
he s a very successful Israeli entrepreneur.


537
0:58:44,66 --> 0:58:52,599
He goes to conferences. I d say six days out
of seven he s at a conference somewhere in


538
0:58:52,599 --> 0:58:57,17
the world. It s all over the world, but what
s really interesting about him is he never


539
0:58:57,17 --> 0:59:3,75
goes into a conference, into a session. He
pays the money; he s there, but he never goes


540
0:59:3,75 --> 0:59:10,74
into the session. He finds a sofa outside
the room and he just sits there, and as he


541
0:59:10,74 --> 0:59:17,13
sees interesting people wondering through
the hall he kind of calls them over and says,


542
0:59:17,13 --> 0:59:23,77
Who are you? Let s talk, and he strikes up
these conversations, and he s a master of


543
0:59:23,77 --> 0:59:28,51
serendipity. s choices like that, I mean,
in terms of design that you, in fact, put


544
0:59:28,51 --> 0:59:34,3
sofas out there, seats out there where people
can connect with each other and start talking,


545
0:59:34,3 --> 0:59:40,98
start conversations. It s really basic things
like that. I just want to finish with a brief


546
0:59:40,98 --> 0:59:46,27
story because it s such a great one on so
many levels. It s actually a guy here in San


547
0:59:46,27 --> 0:59:52,26
Francisco, who many of you I m sure know,
Chris Anderson, who s the editor of Wired


548
0:59:52,26 --> 0:59:59,5
magazine. On the side Chris has a startup
in, of all things, drone aircraft technology,


549
0:59:59,5 --> 1:0:4,89
unmanned aircraft. It s been his passion all
his life, and he decided he was going to set


550
1:0:4,89 --> 1:0:9,26
up this company, and as he set it up he got
more and more anxious because he has absolutely


551
1:0:9,26 --> 1:0:15,4
no technology background himself, and so he
said, How can I do this startup without any


552
1:0:15,4 --> 1:0:21,99
technologists? So he went out and back to
the levels of pull he started with the first


553
1:0:21,99 --> 1:0:26,45
level. He went on a very systematic search.
He went out to all the logical suspects Carnegie


554
1:0:26,45 --> 1:0:36,73
Mellon, MIT, Berkeley, Stanford, Caltech.
Searched ruthlessly through all the PhD programs


555
1:0:36,73 --> 1:0:41,28
to see if he could find anybody who had the
profile of skills and experience that he was


556
1:0:41,28 --> 1:0:47,14
looking for. Nobody. Nothing came up. He was
really frustrated. One day he was in a discussion


557
1:0:47,14 --> 1:0:54,55
forum online discussing drone aircraft technology,
and he struck up a conversation with somebody


558
1:0:54,55 --> 1:0:59,21
he had never encountered before, and the more
he got into the conversation, the more excited


559
1:0:59,21 --> 1:1:4,25
he became. He said, This guy knows more about
drone aircraft technology than anybody I ve


560
1:1:4,25 --> 1:1:10,83
ever met, and he finally asked the question.
He said, Where did you get your PhD from?


561
1:1:10,83 --> 1:1:15,99
And there was kind of this awkward silence
on the other end of the discussion forum.


562
1:1:15,99 --> 1:1:21,48
The guy evaded the question, and they went
on in the conversation and the more they talked


563
1:1:21,48 --> 1:1:26,33
the more excited Christ became, and he ultimately
got enough trust with the guy to probe and


564
1:1:26,33 --> 1:1:34,75
find out who and where he was. It turns out
he was at the time a 19-year-old high-school


565
1:1:34,75 --> 1:1:44,45
graduate in Tijuana, Mexico. Who would have
thought to look among high-school graduates


566
1:1:44,45 --> 1:1:53,27
in Tijuana, Mexico to find the CTO of your
tech startup? This guy, now 23, is the CTO


567
1:1:53,27 --> 1:1:59,99
of Chris startup; has moved to the United
States. But I think it s a great example of


568
1:1:59,99 --> 1:2:2,73
serendipity in action. You often don t know
where to look for the people who are going


569
1:2:2,73 --> 1:2:7,75
to be most valuable to you, and if you don
t participate in environments that help you


570
1:2:7,75 --> 1:2:9,51
to have those unexpected encounters, you re
going to be increasingly challenged. Thank


571
1:2:9,51 --> 1:2:10,4
you. [End of Audio] [Vimeo-210831897] Keynote_John
