1
0:0:2,167 --> 0:0:5,167
<i>As a first-year intern</i>
<i>you have little free time,</i>


2
0:0:5,167 --> 0:0:33,807
<i>When you have a night off it's</i>
<i>important you do something constructive,</i>


3
0:0:33,807 --> 0:0:36,967
- How's it goin'?
- l have no idea who you are.


4
0:0:36,967 --> 0:0:41,407
What's up, dude?


5
0:0:41,407 --> 0:0:43,927
<i>Wait a second, He's dating Carla,</i>


6
0:0:43,927 --> 0:0:48,607
<i>This is not good,</i>


7
0:0:48,607 --> 0:0:51,127
First, l already told her
l got a girlfriend.


8
0:0:51,127 --> 0:0:54,247
Second, you just put
your bare lips on my ear.


9
0:0:54,247 --> 0:0:56,687
- How's it going? l'm...
- JD, l know.


10
0:0:56,687 --> 0:1:1,487
He won't stop talking about you.
l'm Jennifer.


11
0:1:1,487 --> 0:1:4,967
Do you really spend every day
saving children's lives?


12
0:1:4,967 --> 0:1:7,887
Tell the nice lady.


13
0:1:7,887 --> 0:1:9,767
l do what l can.


14
0:1:9,767 --> 0:1:13,207
lt's on! lt's on.


15
0:1:13,207 --> 0:1:17,247
- lt's on!
- <i>Oh yeah,</i>


16
0:1:17,247 --> 0:1:19,447
<i>I know two things about bars,</i>


17
0:1:19,447 --> 0:1:21,727
<i>One they're packed</i>
<i>Thanksgiving week,</i>


18
0:1:21,727 --> 0:1:24,247
<i>Two put a beer in my hand</i>
<i>and I'm Mr Smooth,</i>


19
0:1:24,247 --> 0:1:29,687
l was laughing so hard,
milk was coming out of my nose.


20
0:1:29,687 --> 0:1:35,407
l once tripped over an lV
and blood shot over everyone.


21
0:1:35,407 --> 0:1:38,207
A little got on my nose.


22
0:1:38,207 --> 0:1:40,727
Every damn day, saving those children.


23
0:1:40,727 --> 0:1:44,447
Who wants margaritas?!
Dude, less blood, more fruity drinks.


24
0:1:44,447 --> 0:1:45,767
Right.


25
0:1:45,767 --> 0:1:48,887
<i>Turk hasn't changed a bit since college,</i>


26
0:1:48,887 --> 0:1:51,727
<i>He's the same goof ball</i>
<i>who tells me how to be cooler,</i>


27
0:1:51,727 --> 0:1:54,327
Dude.


28
0:1:54,327 --> 0:1:58,47
- This girl's hot. So don't blow it.
- Why do you say that?


29
0:1:58,47 --> 0:2:1,887
Because you're like a 24-hour
convenience store. You never close.


30
0:2:1,887 --> 0:2:8,967
That sounds like a Fat Albert joke.


31
0:2:8,967 --> 0:2:12,407
Don't worry about it, l feel good
tonight, know what l'm saying?


32
0:2:12,407 --> 0:2:13,607
Good.


33
0:2:13,607 --> 0:2:16,967
Except for this stabbing pain
in my side.


34
0:2:16,967 --> 0:2:19,807
Up all night with a high fever,
cramping and crying.


35
0:2:19,807 --> 0:2:21,327
- Dude!
- My bad.


36
0:2:21,327 --> 0:2:26,167
Not crying, punching the wall all manly
and angry like, you know what l mean?


37
0:2:26,167 --> 0:2:28,247
See ya later, buddy.


38
0:2:28,247 --> 0:2:32,327
Poor Bambi. Don't worry.
Carla will take care of you.


39
0:2:32,327 --> 0:2:35,927
- Make sure he's admitted right away.
- All right.


40
0:2:35,927 --> 0:2:40,87
<i>On the bright side it'll be interesting</i>
<i>to see what it's like to be a patient,</i>


41
0:2:40,87 --> 0:2:43,767
You know people die here?


42
0:2:43,767 --> 0:2:45,87
You're a good friend.


43
0:2:45,87 --> 0:3:3,927
l do what l can.
Can l have your stuff?


44
0:3:3,927 --> 0:3:6,167
So did you talk to any girls last night?


45
0:3:6,167 --> 0:3:8,487
l'm an attractive man,
we both know this.


46
0:3:8,487 --> 0:3:10,927
lt's a burden
you're gonna have to live with.


47
0:3:10,927 --> 0:3:14,367
One of many.


48
0:3:14,367 --> 0:3:16,247
JD talked some girl up.


49
0:3:16,247 --> 0:3:21,567
Really? Are you gonna call her?


50
0:3:21,567 --> 0:3:23,967
Not right away.


51
0:3:23,967 --> 0:3:27,727
Showtime.
Clear out so l can check him out.


52
0:3:27,727 --> 0:3:31,927
You're examining me? l don't want you
to see my unmentionables.


53
0:3:31,927 --> 0:3:33,647
l've seen underwear before.


54
0:3:33,647 --> 0:3:38,127
l use the word unmentionables
for my genitals as well.


55
0:3:38,127 --> 0:3:40,847
68-year-old male
with respiratory distress...


56
0:3:40,847 --> 0:3:44,207
Save your breath.


57
0:3:44,207 --> 0:3:45,807
Hello, Dad.


58
0:3:45,807 --> 0:3:52,647
Never thought you'd call me that again,
after l left.


59
0:3:52,647 --> 0:3:54,287
- Dr Cox!
- Relax, Carla.


60
0:3:54,287 --> 0:3:56,527
The man l'm smothering
isn't my father.


61
0:3:56,527 --> 0:3:58,887
Dr Benson used to be
Chief of Medicine here.


62
0:3:58,887 --> 0:4:6,167
Hi, how are you?


63
0:4:6,167 --> 0:4:8,807
Still have that great rapport
with the nurses?


64
0:4:8,807 --> 0:4:13,367
Carla totally gets me. That's why l've
systematically tried to drive her away.


65
0:4:13,367 --> 0:4:15,527
Ever see that therapist l recommended?


66
0:4:15,527 --> 0:4:20,207
Not yet, no.


67
0:4:20,207 --> 0:4:23,287
Shortness of breath? Dizziness?
Problems urinating?


68
0:4:23,287 --> 0:4:26,967
No. No...
ls it a problem if it whistles?


69
0:4:26,967 --> 0:4:30,847
You're making this so much easier.
Are you sexually active?


70
0:4:30,847 --> 0:4:32,927
lt's active.


71
0:4:32,927 --> 0:4:36,447
l'll write ''rare dry spell''
in the margin.


72
0:4:36,447 --> 0:4:41,727
OK, time for the physical.


73
0:4:41,727 --> 0:4:45,367
Cold hands.


74
0:4:45,367 --> 0:4:49,167
Suck it up!


75
0:4:49,167 --> 0:4:55,47
<i>Elliot's exam was reminiscent of when my</i>
<i>older brother beat the crap out of me,</i>


76
0:4:55,47 --> 0:4:56,167
God!


77
0:4:56,167 --> 0:5:0,847
See, it wasn't so bad. All done.


78
0:5:0,847 --> 0:5:3,167
l'm puking every hour
and my fever's high,


79
0:5:3,167 --> 0:5:5,607
but you're sure it's OK
for me to be out of bed?


80
0:5:5,607 --> 0:5:9,247
l don't know. Dr Benson was my mentor.
Don't do that annoying thing.


81
0:5:9,247 --> 0:5:11,407
- What annoying thing?
- When you talk.


82
0:5:11,407 --> 0:5:12,487
Come on.


83
0:5:12,487 --> 0:5:15,327
- Does that not drive you crazy?
- You get used to it.


84
0:5:15,327 --> 0:5:19,207
l know you're excited with the gown on
but at no time are you to curtsy.


85
0:5:19,207 --> 0:5:22,247
<i>He can say what he wants,</i>
<i>but he's showing me off,</i>


86
0:5:22,247 --> 0:5:23,447
Dr Benson.


87
0:5:23,447 --> 0:5:27,487
Just give us a second, will ya, big guy?
Did you hear about her?


88
0:5:27,487 --> 0:5:30,447
<i>Watching Dr Cox</i>
<i>I realised we never really stop</i>


89
0:5:30,447 --> 0:5:41,47
<i>craving the attention</i>
<i>of people we look up to,</i>


90
0:5:41,47 --> 0:5:44,527
Any questions?


91
0:5:44,527 --> 0:5:47,847
Good.


92
0:5:47,847 --> 0:5:49,887
- He seemed nice.
- Careful, Newbie.


93
0:5:49,887 --> 0:5:53,207
l'm hearing it now.
lt is kind of annoying when l talk.


94
0:5:53,207 --> 0:5:57,207
<i>In a lot of relationships you regress</i>
<i>to the person you were when you met,</i>


95
0:5:57,207 --> 0:5:59,607
So Elliot's exam was that bad?


96
0:5:59,607 --> 0:6:1,887
- Dude, she violated me.
- ln a good way?


97
0:6:1,887 --> 0:6:3,567
What's the deal?


98
0:6:3,567 --> 0:6:5,447
l think l broke my ass!


99
0:6:5,447 --> 0:6:7,687
You're telling everyone l violated you.


100
0:6:7,687 --> 0:6:12,327
Not everyone, just the people
that work here. And my parents.


101
0:6:12,327 --> 0:6:14,647
Was there something wrong
with my exam?


102
0:6:14,647 --> 0:6:17,727
<i>So there it is, The classic trap,</i>
<i>Two choices,</i>


103
0:6:17,727 --> 0:6:21,247
<i>Either wuss out</i>
<i>or tell the truth,</i>


104
0:6:21,247 --> 0:6:23,127
You're kinda rough.


105
0:6:23,127 --> 0:6:26,567
You're rough and
you're a little businesslike.


106
0:6:26,567 --> 0:6:28,687
- You're cold.
- You mean my hands?


107
0:6:28,687 --> 0:6:32,207
Yeah, those too. l just think
you could be more comforting.


108
0:6:32,207 --> 0:6:35,687
<i>I could tell she appreciated</i>
<i>how hard it was for me to say that,</i>


109
0:6:35,687 --> 0:6:38,447
Do you know how annoying
you are when you talk?


110
0:6:38,447 --> 0:6:42,767
<i>Maybe not,</i>


111
0:6:42,767 --> 0:6:48,967
- l was watching that.
- lt's broken.


112
0:6:48,967 --> 0:6:52,967
Dr Cox. Did you get my memo
reminding senior staff


113
0:6:52,967 --> 0:6:55,527
that lab coats
must be worn at all times?


114
0:6:55,527 --> 0:6:59,567
You know, l did get it, Bob,
and at first l just threw it away,


115
0:6:59,567 --> 0:7:2,647
but then l decided that
wasn't a grand enough gesture.


116
0:7:2,647 --> 0:7:5,207
So l made a replica of you
out of straw


117
0:7:5,207 --> 0:7:8,847
and then l put my lab coat on it
with your memo in the pocket,


118
0:7:8,847 --> 0:7:10,927
then invited the neighbourhood kids


119
0:7:10,927 --> 0:7:14,927
to light it on fire
and whack it with sticks.


120
0:7:14,927 --> 0:7:18,167
So, l have been looking
at Dr Benson's chart.


121
0:7:18,167 --> 0:7:20,327
His chest x-ray was normal,


122
0:7:20,327 --> 0:7:25,127
his vitals are stable,
so let's discharge him.


123
0:7:25,127 --> 0:7:27,327
Now hold the phone there, skipper.


124
0:7:27,327 --> 0:7:32,447
Dr Benson should be able to stay here
until he feels he's ready to go.


125
0:7:32,447 --> 0:7:35,887
Give me a break, he was
only Chief of Medicine for ten years.


126
0:7:35,887 --> 0:7:40,647
Well, l haven't had my coffee yet,
so l'm finding it hard coming up with


127
0:7:40,647 --> 0:7:46,127
a more colourful way to say
''Who gives a crap?''


128
0:7:46,127 --> 0:7:50,367
Actually, that wasn't half bad.


129
0:7:50,367 --> 0:7:53,367
Our next patient
is a 26-year-old male


130
0:7:53,367 --> 0:7:57,567
who has presented vomiting,
abdominal cramps and fever.


131
0:7:57,567 --> 0:8:0,367
<i>I never realised how hard</i>
<i>rounds are on the patient,</i>


132
0:8:0,367 --> 0:8:2,447
<i>It feels like you're on display,</i>


133
0:8:2,447 --> 0:8:6,127
Still, Rodin's masterpiece
makes us wonder,


134
0:8:6,127 --> 0:8:9,207
why didn't he spend
a little less time thinking


135
0:8:9,207 --> 0:8:12,687
and a little more time at the gym?


136
0:8:12,687 --> 0:8:14,647
l do cardio.


137
0:8:14,647 --> 0:8:18,487
Which most likely indicates what,
Dr Reid?


138
0:8:18,487 --> 0:8:20,727
He has a simple case
of appendicitis.


139
0:8:20,727 --> 0:8:22,927
How would you proceed,
Dr Dorian?


140
0:8:22,927 --> 0:8:27,407
l would give me that news in private,
no matter how angry l was at me.


141
0:8:27,407 --> 0:8:30,247
Sounds like there's a
fascinating back story here.


142
0:8:30,247 --> 0:8:33,767
Turf him to surgery. Moving on.


143
0:8:33,767 --> 0:8:37,367
Watch it, Bambi. You don't want
a 1 00lb white girl mad at you.


144
0:8:37,367 --> 0:8:40,47
You'll flinch every time
you hear a Range Rover.


145
0:8:40,47 --> 0:8:43,47
l can't believe l have to
spend all Thanksgiving here.


146
0:8:43,47 --> 0:8:46,247
- Tell me that wouldn't kill you.
- Not really.


147
0:8:46,247 --> 0:8:49,127
Do they celebrate Thanksgiving
in your homeland?


148
0:8:49,127 --> 0:8:53,167
- You mean Chicago?
- You have a Chicago?


149
0:8:53,167 --> 0:8:55,207
Be nice to me. l'm getting surgery.


150
0:8:55,207 --> 0:8:58,887
- Dr Wen is the attending.
- Who's the intern doing the work?


151
0:8:58,887 --> 0:9:9,647
<i>I get to cut you open</i>
<i>I get to cut you open</i>


152
0:9:9,647 --> 0:9:11,127
Go, girl!


153
0:9:11,127 --> 0:9:15,927
Go get it.


154
0:9:15,927 --> 0:9:17,807
<i>Good God,</i>


155
0:9:17,807 --> 0:9:20,527
Mr Davis,
you won't be home for Thanksgiving


156
0:9:20,527 --> 0:9:23,47
but you'll be eating leftovers
by Saturday.


157
0:9:23,47 --> 0:9:25,287
Great. And doctor, thank you so much.


158
0:9:25,287 --> 0:9:28,727
You're welcome.


159
0:9:28,727 --> 0:9:32,327
We've gotten to know each other
over the last week, haven't we?


160
0:9:32,327 --> 0:9:33,647
l'd say so.


161
0:9:33,647 --> 0:9:35,607
You found me comforting?


162
0:9:35,607 --> 0:9:37,447
God, no.


163
0:9:37,447 --> 0:9:39,207
l'm pretty good with people.


164
0:9:39,207 --> 0:9:41,127
- You're horrible.
- l'm warm.


165
0:9:41,127 --> 0:9:44,247
You're very cold. l mean, your hands...


166
0:9:44,247 --> 0:9:47,367
- lt's like you're a yeti.
- l have bad circulation.


167
0:9:47,367 --> 0:9:49,847
l do this all day and it doesn't help.


168
0:9:49,847 --> 0:9:53,887
Listen, sweetie, you're
a very efficient, competent doctor.


169
0:9:53,887 --> 0:9:57,407
But your exams...
Do you examine everyone like that


170
0:9:57,407 --> 0:10:0,567
or just people you feel
have wronged you in some way?


171
0:10:0,567 --> 0:10:3,447
- l appreciate your opinion.
- lt's not an opinion.


172
0:10:3,447 --> 0:10:5,767
You see those guys right there?


173
0:10:5,767 --> 0:10:9,87
They're pretending to be asleep
so you won't manhandle them.


174
0:10:9,87 --> 0:10:13,127
- They are not.
- Dude, what are you doing?


175
0:10:13,127 --> 0:10:14,807
Too frank, right?


176
0:10:14,807 --> 0:10:19,47
l know. lt's probably why my mom
pushed me down the stairs.


177
0:10:19,47 --> 0:10:22,727
She is fat, though. And boring.


178
0:10:22,727 --> 0:10:25,407
BP's 60 over palp.
ls he having a heart attack?


179
0:10:25,407 --> 0:10:28,727
lt's hypotension and
electrical alternance on the monitor.


180
0:10:28,727 --> 0:10:30,647
This is tamponade.


181
0:10:30,647 --> 0:10:35,127
Viral infections can cause pericarditis
and a rapid accumulation of fluid.


182
0:10:35,127 --> 0:10:38,167
lt looks like a heart attack
but don't let it fool you.


183
0:10:38,167 --> 0:10:40,287
BP's stabilizing.


184
0:10:40,287 --> 0:10:43,647
- What have we got?
- Don't worry. We're fine here.


185
0:10:43,647 --> 0:10:47,487
<i>It's a universal feeling to want</i>
<i>to be there for a good friend,</i>


186
0:10:47,487 --> 0:10:51,207
<i>So from now on I'm going to stop</i>
<i>seeing Turk as my crazy frat brother,</i>


187
0:10:51,207 --> 0:10:52,567
Dr Turk, if you will?


188
0:10:52,567 --> 0:10:56,127
We'll mark for the incision
right about here.


189
0:10:56,127 --> 0:10:59,567
<i>After all he's a highly trained</i>
<i>competent young doctor,</i>


190
0:10:59,567 --> 0:11:1,127
Dude!


191
0:11:1,127 --> 0:11:7,727
l'm about to bust a mad
sliz-ice in your insides!


192
0:11:7,727 --> 0:11:11,527
Sir, l'd prefer if someone other
than Dr Turk performed the surgery.


193
0:11:11,527 --> 0:11:13,127
Fair enough.


194
0:11:13,127 --> 0:11:23,727
Dr Cotter will perform
the procedure tomorrow morning.


195
0:11:23,727 --> 0:11:27,567
<i>The best thing about friends is how</i>
<i>quickly things like this blow over,</i>


196
0:11:27,567 --> 0:11:31,567
- You understand, right?
- Whatever, man.


197
0:11:31,567 --> 0:11:34,967
You want some salsa
for that chip on your shoulder?


198
0:11:34,967 --> 0:11:39,327
l can't believe you. l would never ever
do something like this to you.


199
0:11:39,327 --> 0:11:42,407
- You're like school in July.
- What do you mean?


200
0:11:42,407 --> 0:11:50,647
No class.


201
0:11:50,647 --> 0:11:53,487
You're not supposed
to scare me like that, sir.


202
0:11:53,487 --> 0:11:56,847
lt was just a prank.
Admittedly, l took it too far.


203
0:11:56,847 --> 0:11:59,647
Well, l still laughed, but...


204
0:11:59,647 --> 0:12:2,607
l felt a little guilty
l wasn't here administering...


205
0:12:2,607 --> 0:12:5,967
l just came to check on
my favourite patient.


206
0:12:5,967 --> 0:12:8,167
l must have the wrong room.


207
0:12:8,167 --> 0:12:10,447
- How are you, Dave?
- l'm doing great, Bob.


208
0:12:10,447 --> 0:12:11,887
l owe you one.


209
0:12:11,887 --> 0:12:14,847
Hey, doc, you should
go ahead and get some rest.


210
0:12:14,847 --> 0:12:16,687
l'll be out of your hair soon.


211
0:12:16,687 --> 0:12:22,207
Just a sec, skipper. You'll stay here
until you decide you're ready to leave.


212
0:12:22,207 --> 0:12:27,47
For God's sake, you were the Chief
of Medicine here for over ten years.


213
0:12:27,47 --> 0:12:32,487
Am l right?


214
0:12:32,487 --> 0:12:34,647
That was what l said this morning.


215
0:12:34,647 --> 0:12:41,887
Yeah, it sounded familiar.


216
0:12:41,887 --> 0:12:44,7
- What?
- l was wondering


217
0:12:44,7 --> 0:12:46,727
how you comb your hair
so the horns don't show?


218
0:12:46,727 --> 0:12:48,807
l wonder what bothers you the most?


219
0:12:48,807 --> 0:12:51,887
ls it that l saved his life
and he likes me as a person?


220
0:12:51,887 --> 0:12:54,327
l bet it's how much
he respects me as a doctor.


221
0:12:54,327 --> 0:13:3,727
How does that taste?
Bitter? Hard to get down?


222
0:13:3,727 --> 0:13:5,807
- Here you go.
- Great.


223
0:13:5,807 --> 0:13:8,967
Carla, everyone likes you so much,
it makes me wonder...


224
0:13:8,967 --> 0:13:12,367
- Why patients think you're a cold fish?
- My God, you noticed?


225
0:13:12,367 --> 0:13:16,287
- Honey, they told me.
- Great. lf anyone needs me,


226
0:13:16,287 --> 0:13:19,7
l'll be in the supply closet
eating sugar packets.


227
0:13:19,7 --> 0:13:22,527
Look, Elliot...


228
0:13:22,527 --> 0:13:26,247
l'm not the kind of person who likes
telling people what to do, but...


229
0:13:26,247 --> 0:13:30,127
Here's what to do. Here's what l think.
Here's what your problem is.


230
0:13:30,127 --> 0:13:32,487
Don't think of your patients
as strangers.


231
0:13:32,487 --> 0:13:35,767
l'm dating Turk, l get it.
Sometimes he is a big kid.


232
0:13:35,767 --> 0:13:39,647
But when it comes to work, he's
as capable and mature as anyone.


233
0:13:39,647 --> 0:13:42,127
Take those out.


234
0:13:42,127 --> 0:13:44,47
Baby, l was being a walrus.


235
0:13:44,47 --> 0:13:48,327
JD's not only your friend
but a patient too, and he's scared.


236
0:13:48,327 --> 0:13:52,687
Kelso is pushing your buttons.
Every now and then let something go.


237
0:13:52,687 --> 0:13:56,607
Turk's not that mature. He spent
all yesterday being a walrus.


238
0:13:56,607 --> 0:13:58,927
He had straws and stuff...


239
0:13:58,927 --> 0:14:2,207
The only thing
JD's scared of is sharks.


240
0:14:2,207 --> 0:14:6,287
And he has a weird thing with pennies.
He's not scared about this.


241
0:14:6,287 --> 0:14:11,287
Kelso's not just some harmless
guy pushing my buttons, Carla.


242
0:14:11,287 --> 0:14:12,647
He's a pod person.


243
0:14:12,647 --> 0:14:15,167
- You're wrong.
- You're so wrong.


244
0:14:15,167 --> 0:14:21,247
<i>Wrong wrong wrong wrong</i>


245
0:14:21,247 --> 0:14:27,7
<i>You're wrong,</i>


246
0:14:27,7 --> 0:14:30,447
l think you're right. l don't know
how to connect with patients.


247
0:14:30,447 --> 0:14:34,967
Start by touching them, holding
their hand, or stroking their hair,


248
0:14:34,967 --> 0:14:37,167
or give them
a reassuring pat on the arm.


249
0:14:37,167 --> 0:14:43,407
- What are you doing?
- Nothing. You'll be great.


250
0:14:43,407 --> 0:14:46,927
Darn right.


251
0:14:46,927 --> 0:14:53,127
There you go, sir.


252
0:14:53,127 --> 0:15:6,967
l'm sorry. lt's my watch, l'll get it.


253
0:15:6,967 --> 0:15:16,687
l'm so sorry. Let me...


254
0:15:16,687 --> 0:15:21,927
Dave, at Sacred Heart we don't
treat symptoms, we treat people.


255
0:15:21,927 --> 0:15:25,167
- There's something on your back.
- What does this one say?


256
0:15:25,167 --> 0:15:28,87
''Never stop kicking me.''


257
0:15:28,87 --> 0:15:32,367
And on the other side
is my discharge form.


258
0:15:32,367 --> 0:15:36,807
Bob, you tried to discharge me
an hour before l almost died?


259
0:15:36,807 --> 0:15:40,87
Well...


260
0:15:40,87 --> 0:15:42,647
How very clever.


261
0:15:42,647 --> 0:15:44,967
What? lt wasn't me. ln fact...


262
0:15:44,967 --> 0:15:52,447
l think you put it there
yourself to get more attention.


263
0:15:52,447 --> 0:15:59,487
lt was me. l put it there.


264
0:15:59,487 --> 0:16:3,447
Hey, buddy. OK,
forget about everything that's going on.


265
0:16:3,447 --> 0:16:7,247
We know that you're bummed out
about missing Thanksgiving so...


266
0:16:7,247 --> 0:16:9,767
we decided to bring it to you.


267
0:16:9,767 --> 0:16:18,87
Wow, guys, thanks.
Where's the food?


268
0:16:18,87 --> 0:16:23,87
Who wants the unmentionables?


269
0:16:23,87 --> 0:16:25,927
Bambi? Your fever's spiking.


270
0:16:25,927 --> 0:16:30,167
They're worried your appendix might
burst so we're going into surgery now.


271
0:16:30,167 --> 0:16:31,407
Who's on call?


272
0:16:31,407 --> 0:16:41,367
Dr Turk, let's get started.


273
0:16:41,367 --> 0:16:45,167
<i>Most doctors don't believe in</i>
<i>the out-of-body experience thing</i>


274
0:16:45,167 --> 0:16:47,367
<i>and I don't know</i>
<i>if it was real or a dream</i>


275
0:16:47,367 --> 0:16:50,927
<i>but I swear I was up there</i>
<i>watching Turk operate on me,</i>


276
0:16:50,927 --> 0:16:55,247
<i>And I have to say</i>
<i>he's an amazing surgeon,</i>


277
0:16:55,247 --> 0:16:58,687
Dude, could you not look over
my shoulder while l'm doing this?


278
0:16:58,687 --> 0:17:0,527
lt's a little unnerving.


279
0:17:0,527 --> 0:17:5,167
You've got a little fever.
Probably atelectasis from lying in bed.


280
0:17:5,167 --> 0:17:8,7
- l'm really uncomfortable.
- l'm so sorry.


281
0:17:8,7 --> 0:17:12,7
- You're not gonna hug me, are you?
- l'm done with all that.


282
0:17:12,7 --> 0:17:15,647
lf it makes you feel better,
l hate this touchy-feely culture.


283
0:17:15,647 --> 0:17:16,807
Thank you.


284
0:17:16,807 --> 0:17:19,247
That whole ''kiss hello'' thing.


285
0:17:19,247 --> 0:17:22,7
l don't want anyone touching me
unless we have sex.


286
0:17:22,7 --> 0:17:24,207
Even then l don't want them
to overdo it.


287
0:17:24,207 --> 0:17:27,247
- Where in Connecticut are you from?
- Greenwich. You?


288
0:17:27,247 --> 0:17:33,127
Darien.
l'm really burning up here.


289
0:17:33,127 --> 0:17:36,487
God, that's fantastic.
lt's like an ice pack.


290
0:17:36,487 --> 0:17:39,327
Yeah.


291
0:17:39,327 --> 0:17:43,167
l'm sorry to hear about your mom.
Are you at least close with your dad?


292
0:17:43,167 --> 0:17:47,47
You see this right here?
That's his work.


293
0:17:47,47 --> 0:17:49,767
Pretty good for a man
in a wheelchair.


294
0:17:49,767 --> 0:17:52,927
Doc, l'm sorry you gotta be here
on Thanksgiving night.


295
0:17:52,927 --> 0:17:56,727
My wife can't cook anyway, she's 22.
What are you doing?


296
0:17:56,727 --> 0:18:0,287
Forget about me. What's your wife
look like? Any pictures?


297
0:18:0,287 --> 0:18:2,447
Not of this one.


298
0:18:2,447 --> 0:18:5,47
You know, being back at this old place,


299
0:18:5,47 --> 0:18:8,327
you know the thing l have found
to be the most disappointing?


300
0:18:8,327 --> 0:18:9,607
l think l can guess.


301
0:18:9,607 --> 0:18:12,647
You.


302
0:18:12,647 --> 0:18:16,847
Probably because you do things
like show up the Chief of Medicine,


303
0:18:16,847 --> 0:18:20,367
when anybody who's been in a room
with Bob Kelso for two minutes


304
0:18:20,367 --> 0:18:21,887
knows how big an ass he is.


305
0:18:21,887 --> 0:18:26,567
- Go easy, l just thought...
- You don't think, Perry.


306
0:18:26,567 --> 0:18:29,167
You're such a talented doctor.


307
0:18:29,167 --> 0:18:34,207
lf you played the game you'd be in
a position to change things around here.


308
0:18:34,207 --> 0:18:40,487
But you're too stubborn for that,
aren't you?


309
0:18:40,487 --> 0:18:42,247
All right, kid.


310
0:18:42,247 --> 0:18:57,727
Gin. Your deal.


311
0:18:57,727 --> 0:19:0,927
Hi. l just need to
check on your incision.


312
0:19:0,927 --> 0:19:3,127
- Turk, l was an idiot.
- lt's OK, man.


313
0:19:3,127 --> 0:19:7,287
No, seriously, man. l want you to know,
if l ever need surgery again,


314
0:19:7,287 --> 0:19:8,807
l want you inside of me.


315
0:19:8,807 --> 0:19:15,207
l want to be the one inside of you.


316
0:19:15,207 --> 0:19:18,727
Look, JD, l get it.


317
0:19:18,727 --> 0:19:22,847
To me you'll always be that geeky kid
with the Pat Benatar t-shirt.


318
0:19:22,847 --> 0:19:26,167
Dude, she rocks.


319
0:19:26,167 --> 0:19:29,127
l want you to know
how serious l am about what l do.


320
0:19:29,127 --> 0:19:31,407
Did you stitch your initials into me?


321
0:19:31,407 --> 0:19:37,927
That's not important. lt's still
Thanksgiving for 20 more minutes.


322
0:19:37,927 --> 0:19:40,487
Now, you can have ginger ale


323
0:19:40,487 --> 0:19:44,247
and a cracker.


324
0:19:44,247 --> 0:19:47,407
l forgot. Your change. Two pennies.


325
0:19:47,407 --> 0:19:50,487
Get those pennies away from me.


326
0:19:50,487 --> 0:19:52,607
Happy Thanksgiving, man.


327
0:19:52,607 --> 0:19:54,607
<i>I guess what they say is true,</i>


328
0:19:54,607 --> 0:19:57,567
<i>The people you work with</i>
<i>really do become your family,</i>


329
0:19:57,567 --> 0:20:0,527
<i>Like your brother,</i>


330
0:20:0,527 --> 0:20:3,247
<i>And your sister-in-law,</i>


331
0:20:3,247 --> 0:20:6,447
<i>Or that cousin</i>
<i>you have funny feelings for,</i>


332
0:20:6,447 --> 0:20:14,607
<i>And the crazy angry uncle everyone</i>
<i>sort of hopes isn't coming this year,</i>


333
0:20:14,607 --> 0:20:18,447
Dr Cox.


334
0:20:18,447 --> 0:20:21,247
lf you want, you can
come down here and hang out...


335
0:20:21,247 --> 0:20:23,287
Nobody talk.


336
0:20:23,287 --> 0:20:26,727
Just drink.


337
0:20:26,727 --> 0:20:29,847
<i>Uncomfortable silences</i>
<i>and alcohol,</i>


338
0:20:29,847 --> 0:20:33,607
<i>Just like Thanksgiving at home,</i>


339
0:20:33,607 --> 0:20:40,847
Drink!


340
0:20:40,847 --> 0:22:40,847
- There was the Nina...
- Shut up!
