###3 - The pole was 50 feet away.
###6 - And by "50" you mean "2," right?
###8 - Mom, I wasn't gonna hit it.
###10 - Then, it was gonna hit you.
###12 Lindsey, just because the car has a high safety ranking
###15 doesn't mean you should drive crazy
###16 To see if they're telling the truth.
###22 - You gonna tell me how to close the door too?
###24 - No. Since you already used the parking assist
###27 to back up safely into the driveway
###28 and managed not to hit the house,
###30 I think you can close the door on your own.
###34 - How was that?
###35 - Fine.
###40 - It's okay, baby.
###41 I won't let her hurt you.
###44 I know you're safe for the environment,
###46 and I'm going to make sure
###47 That the environment is safe for you.
###51 What are you looking at?
###52 Mind your business!
###55 Nosy.
###62 - Hey. How'd the driving lesson go?
###64 - What did Lindsey say?
###67 - Nothing.
###68 - Mm-Hmm.
###69 Did she tell you she almost hit a pole,
###71 came this close to running a red light,
###73 made a left-hand turn from the right Lane,
###75 And cut off a cop?
###76 If it weren't for the star safety system,
###79 we would have rear-ended somebody at chicken on a stick.
###82 - What are you looking at?
###84 - Nothing.
###86 - Um.
###87 Huh. Not good, huh?
###90 - Nick, all white women were giving her the finger.
###94 - Oh, are you okay?
###95 - I'm fine.
###97 It was just a bit much, you know,
###98 and I spent most of the day trying to plan
###100 that rich girl's sweet 16 party.
###102 - Oh, at that solar-powered house at the waterfront.
###104 - Yeah, because she wants a green party.
###106 - Oh, it's green, all right.
###108 - Oh, and get this.
###110 Her parents are now buying her a brand-new prius,
###112 custom green, and they want me to get Katy Perry
###115 To sing <i>Happy Birthday.</i>
###117 The whole party is so they can impress other parents.
###120 <i>for Ashley's birthday, we rented Katy Perry</i>.
###123 You know what I got for my 16th birthday?
###126 A leather eight-ball jacket and a clean version
###128 of <i>straight outta Compton.</i>
###130 - Hmm. Man.
###133 Sounds like you got a lot on your plate, babe.
###135 Aw.
###136 You got one girl driving you crazy,
###138 another girl driving crazy.
###140 If you hadn't lost your mind already,
###143 we'd really be in trouble.
###145 Well, you know what, since you're so concerned
###147 with my health and well being, you teach Lindsey to drive.
###151 - I ain't scared of that girl.
###153 - You may not have any hair on your head,
###155 but I'll bet she can turn your eyebrows gray.
###157 - Pssht.
###167 - Are we there yet?
###168 sync and correct by dr.jackson www.addic7ed.com
###174 Okay, Lindsey.
###176 Do you have your checklist memorized?
###179 - Yes, dad.
###180 - All right, well, let's hear it.
###182 - When I am driving, there is no eating,
###185 no drinking, no makeup, no texting...
###187 - Especially no texts.
###189 As a matter of fact, every time you get in the car,
###191 Where should your phone be?
###193 - In the glove compartment.
###194 - That's right. And when you take a call?
###196 - Use my Bluetooth.
###197 - Make a call? - Pull over...
###199 - No. Turn on your blinker, look in your mirrors,
###202 and <i>safely</i> pull over.
###205 - Right. Do all that, then pull over
###206 And turn the car off.
###207 - All right.
###208 It seems like you've been listening.
###211 Check, check. Check, check, check.
###213 And check. Good job.
###216 - I'm checking my mirrors to be sure
###218 it is safe to proceed.
###219 - Why are you checking mirrors?
###221 The street is right in front of you.
###223 - oh.
###227 - No radio, no singing, no humming, no head bobbing,
###230 no finger snapping, no finger tapping,
###232 no head nodding, no lip-synching.
###235 Shouldn't you be writing this down?
###236 - Mom!
###240 - Oh, absolutely, Ashley.
###243 oh...
###244 O.M.G., Ashley.
###247 Okay. Okay.
###249 Okay, bye-bye.
###252 Now after they cut the birthday cake,
###254 they want fireworks.
###257 - If they wanted real fireworks, they could just cancel the party
###260 and watch the girl explode.
###266 - Hi, Ashley.
###269 Oh, a white tiger, and you want to ride it.
###271 Okay.
###272 - Kevin. - Yeah?
###274 - Where are you going with that giant bottle of soda?
###277 - It's for my science project. I'm building a rocket.
###280 All I need is this and a pack of mentos.
###282 - Kevin, building a rocket is too easy and unoriginal.
###288 Now, I'm not gonna have you get shown up
###289 by those other kids in your class
###291 like you did last year.
###292 So this year, you're going to build
###294 Something original that no one else will have:
###297 a solar-powered house.
###300 - What? Mom!
###301 What's so original about a solar-powered house?
###304 Everybody's got a house.
###305 Who do you know who has a rocket?
###307 - Well, I can tell you who's not going to have one.
###309 Kevin, last year, you got a "d" on your science project.
###313 Now, it wasn't your fault,
###314 because all the other kids had help with their projects.
###316 So this year, I'm helping you, and we, meaning you,
###320 are building a solar-powered house.
###323 - Can it be the House of a guy who has a rocket?
###325 - Sure. - Yes!
###327 - Yeah!
###328 Uhh. - Uhh.
###334 - wow. Lindsey.
###336 Nice work.
###337 - Check.
###339 - Sounds like the driving lesson was a success.
###341 - Dad is awesome.
###344 - Check.
###346 All it took was just a little bit of patience.
###349 - Mm-Hmm.
###350 Nick, I can't stand you.
###352 You mean to tell me you spent three hours in the car
###354 with that girl and didn't have a problem?
###356 - Nope. - Nothing?
###357 - Nada. - Serious?
###359 - All right, we may have went the wrong way
###362 down a one-way street, but other than that...
###365 What's this?
###366 - Kevin's science project.
###367 I'm helping him.
###368 We're building a solar-powered house.
###370 - I thought he wanted to build a rocket.
###372 - I do.
###373 - Be quiet!
###379 - Hey.
###381 - Hey. How's it going with Ashley?
###384 - Don't ask.
###386 What's all this?
###388 - Kevin's science project.
###389 We're building a solar-powered house.
###392 - Stupid question.
###393 - Won't be the first.
###394 - But I always wondered...
###396 What happens at night?
###398 - Huh?
###399 okay, miss energy efficient.
###401 You didn't think about that, did you?
###403 Now, y'all figure that out, you come and then you talk to me
###405 about a solar house.
###407 But until then, I'm sticking with the wall plugs.
###412 - Ashley? - Mm-Hmm.
###414 Now she wants a red carpet for her V.I.P. Arrivals.
###418 - Somebody should tell her she's 16.
###420 Nobody important is at her party.
###426 - I'm hungry.
###428 - Do you want a cracker?
###434 - Mmm.
###435 - Why does she keep calling?
###437 - She's in her car.
###439 - Gigi.
###440 - Gotta go.
###450 - Kevin. - Yeah?
###451 - Why are you using my good glue?
###453 - I'm building a launch tower for my rocket.
###456 - I said he had a rocket.
###457 I didn't say he had it in his backyard.
###459 - So no launch tower?
###461 - Your launch has been postponed.
###463 Go upstairs.
###470 - Hey, sleepy.
###472 - Hi.
###474 Where were you?
###475 - A little coffee run.
###476 Plus I gassed up your car and got it washed.
###478 You were still knocked out when I left.
###481 What were you doing up so late last night?
###483 - Working on Kevin's project.
###486 I didn't come to bed till almost 2:00.
###489 I had no idea how much work goes into building
###492 a solar-powered house.
###494 - You're not supposed to.
###495 Maybe you should let Kevin work on his own project.
###499 - Well, none of those other kids are working on their projects,
###501 And I'm not gonna let him walk in with some funky old rocket
###504 When all these other kids are showing up
###506 with nuclear reactors made out of Popsicle sticks
###508 and nuclear reactor parts.
###510 - Somebody had that?
###512 - No, I'm just saying.
###513 - Baby, isn't the point of the project
###516 To let the kid work and learn something?
###520 - Who are you, Bill Nye the science guy?
###522 No. The point of the project is to get an "a."
###526 And when those other parents let their kids learn something,
###528 then I'll let my kid learn something.
###529 But in the meantime,
###531 we all just gonna have to be stupid together.
###534 What?
###535 - Nothing.
###543 - Mom. Mommy.
###548 - Can you move the car?
###549 - What are you doing? Don't wake her up.
###551 - What? - Come on.
###556 - I want to skateboard, but mom's car's in the driveway.
###559 - Fine, I'll move it.
###560 - You can't drive.
###561 - Do you want to skateboard or not?
###562 - Skateboard.
###565 - Come on. - Uh-uh.
###567 I'll come out once you're out of that car.
###570 You need my helmet? - Nope.
###576 - Nick!
###581 Gigi, are you sure you don't know what happened?
###584 - Suzanne, I drove around the block
###587 while you picked up the box.
###589 If something happened, I'd noticed!
###592 - Well, somebody around here better know something,
###594 because I'm about ready to explode!
###596 - What's up?
###597 - Why is there a dent in my car?
###605 - Well, I don't know how it happened,
###608 But I know one thing, I didn't do it.
###611 - Well, you're the only other one who drove it.
###613 - That doesn't mean I dented it.
###615 - Yeah, it kind of does.
###617 - The only people who drove the car
###618 Besides me and Gigi was you and Lindsey.
###621 She didn't do it when she was with me,
###622 and she didn't do it when she was with you.
###624 Did she?
###625 - No. - Well, all right, then.
###627 - All right, then, what? - Who did it?
###630 - Maybe you dented it, and you didn't realize it.
###633 - Nick, I think I would know if I dented my car.
###636 - What about the time you d... - Aren't you hungry?
###638 - Uh, yes.
###639 Yes, I am hungry.
###645 - Okay, let's go through it again.
###647 So you went to get coffee this morning...
###650 - Right.
###651 - And you went to the car wash.
###653 - Right.
###655 - Wait! That's it!
###657 - You dented it at the car wash?
###658 - No.
###659 The reason I went to the car wash
###661 Is because I got a free coupon when I valeted
###663 At the restaurant last night.
###665 - Great. So...Now what?
###667 - I'm going down there.
###668 They're gonna pay for that dent.
###669 oh. Yeah. That'll happen.
###671 Right after Jessica alba starts responding to my emails.
###675 You know that little ticket they give you at the valet?
###678 - Yeah, so?
###679 - Well, it indemnifies them against anything and everything
###682 That happens to the car while in their position
###684 Including but not limited to them stealing
###686 All your possessions and lighting the car on fire.
###689 Technically speaking, they don't even need to park it.
###692 They can just leave your car in the middle of the street.
###694 - Well, how do you know all that?
###695 - Because one time, they left my car
###696 In the middle of the street.
###698 - Well, all I know is,
###699 Somebody's about to pay for something.
###701 - Said the waitress to a certain professional golfer.
###708 - Kevin, be very, very careful with this.
###713 - Mom, if you keep telling me to be careful,
###715 I'm gonna get nervous and drop it.
###717 - Okay, get nervous and drop it.
###720 - Mom! - All right, all right.
###721 Good luck.
###723 I love you.
###724 - Bye, mommy. - Bye.
###725 Oh, and don't forget to tell them to look inside
###728 so they can see the photoshopped family
###730 and the miniature couch and the solar-powered pet.
###733 Eek! So cute.
###738 - We didn't dent your precious prius.
###740 - Look, maybe you did it and you didn't realize it.
###742 That's all.
###744 - We didn't, and even if we did,
###745 it's not our responsibility.
###747 It says in our policy
###749 That we're not responsible for anything.
###750 If I leave your car in the middle of the street,
###752 Guess what, it's not our fault.
###754 It's a contract.
###755 - No, no, no. That is not a contract.
###757 That is a claim ticket, man.
###758 What are you talking about?
###760 - It's a contract.
###761 Prince the musician, he never parks here
###763 Because he hates contract.
###764 You want to be like him, it's all good.
###767 Okay, but listen to me.
###768 It's accepting this and leaving your car with us,
###770 You have accepted this a contract.
###772 You're lucky to even have your car back.
###774 - Look, nobody reads these things, man.
###776 - Whose fault is that?
###777 I'm sorry.
###779 Next time you come, we'll park your car for free...
###781 Only if I remember this conversation
###785 And you wear the same outfit.
###787 You look the same, I look the same,
###789 We can shake to it right now.
###790 - Dog, dog, you did not spit in your hand
###792 And put that near me.
###793 Put your hand back in there.
###794 Look, I don't know how they do things
###796 In Madagascar, where you from,
###797 But I'm gonna tell you here right now.
###799 I'm gonna tell you how this runs, brother.
###801 Talking about some free parking? Free parking?
###802 Do you know how much my car cost?
###804 This is how this is about to run.
###806 You are gonna pay to get my car fixed.
###808 - Or what?
###809 - You know what's gonna happen if you don't?
###812 I will never come to this restaurant again.
###815 - You're never gonna come here?
###818 You know you are cheating yourself.
###819 The food is fantastic. It's the best you ever had.
###821 - I'm not missing the food.
###823 I don't care about the food anymore.
###824 I liked it. I admit.
###825 I loved the food in the past. - Okay.
###827 - But you know what, this is over, man.
###828 This ruined the whole food experience for me.
###831 You wrecked my car.
###832 - I will never see you again.
###833 - You'll never see me.
###834 - I'll never see that sweater again.
###835 You promise me?
###837 - You know what, can I talk to your supervisor please?
###839 - I am the supervisor.
###840 - Oh, no.
###841 The bowtie does not make you a supervisor.
###843 - This is my supervisor bowtie. - No, it's not.
###845 Can I talk to the person who is responsible for this?
###847 - I am responsible for everything
###848 In that we are not responsible for anything.
###851 You know what,
###852 I am never gonna valet here again.
###854 - Never?
###855 - I'm gonna tell everybody too.
###856 I'm gonna tell that this is not the place to go
###858 To get your car valeted.
###860 - You don't know anybody.
###861 You have two friends on Facebook,
###862 Your cousin and Tom.
###867 You are walking away!
###871 - It's a lose-lose situation.
###873 If we pay out of pocket to fix the car,
###875 It's gonna cost $500.
###877 - $500?
###879 - Did you call the insurance company?
###880 - Good question. Yes.
###882 And if we filed a claim,
###883 Guess how much the deductible is.
###885 - $500. - $500.
###887 - And our rate could go up.
###889 - So we get punished because someone dented the car.
###892 - That's just a shame.
###893 - Uh, anybody want some water?
###895 I'm gonna go get some water because I'm thirsty.
###897 - Well, mom, do you know who dented your car?
###900 - The valet at that restaurant.
###901 - Are you sure?
###902 Those valet guys are usually pretty good drivers.
###904 - Well, this one wasn't.
###906 - All I know is, if I worked at that valet stand
###908 And I knew the guy who dented mom's car,
###910 They'd have to pay me a lot of money
###911 For me not to say anything.
###918 - What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do?
###921 - I don't know.
###922 It seems like you got yourself in a real situation.
###924 - Kevin, come on. This isn't funny.
###926 - Oh, trust me. I know.
###928 It's not funny for you, but it's hilarious over here.
###930 - There's no way I can let mom and dad find out about this.
###933 - Oh, yeah. I totally agree. It would be disastrous.
###937 - Kevin - Yes?
###939 - Please don't tell mom and dad about this.
###941 - What makes you think I'd do such a thing?
###943 - Kevin, come on, dude. Please.
###945 - Trust me, Lindsey. I don't want to.
###948 But mom, she loves her car,
###949 And it'd just be awful for me not to say anything.
###952 - All right. Fine. What's it gonna cost me?
###954 - I don't know.
###955 I was thinking, like, three figures.
###957 - $100! I'll give you $20.
###959 - $50.
###960 - $35, and I'll keep my mouth shut the next time
###962 You do something you don't want them to know about.
###964 - Like what?
###965 - Like extorting your sister for money.
###967 - Okay, deal.
###968 Uh, do you mind picking up around here?
###970 I'm thinking about having Troy over later.
###972 Oh, yeah, you can take that.
###974 She's nasty.
###983 - what'd you get?
###985 What'd you get?
###986 - I got a "c"!
###988 - You got a "c"?
###990 How did you get a "c"?
###992 - Well, my teacher took her pen and made a little half circle
###996 And told me that my solar-powered house
###997 Was unoriginal and uninspired.
###1002 - I don't believe that.
###1004 - Yeah, and she also told me
###1005 That if I didn't have the launchpad,
###1007 I would have gotten a "d."
###1009 Yeah, and she also told me that that was
###1011 The only interesting thing about the project
###1013 And if I had the rocket with it, I would have gotten an "a."
###1016 I mean, I'm just sayin'. You know, I'm just...
###1019 - I'm just sayin', I may be wrong,
###1022 But you're still 12, and by the time the cops get here,
###1024 It'll be too late.
###1026 - I love you, mommy.
###1027 - Mm-Hmm.
###1032 - Dad, what are you doing?
###1034 - I'm going to picket the valet at Jimmy's.
###1036 Either he's getting fired, or I'm getting arrested,
###1038 But somebody's getting something.
###1039 - Dad, wait. You can't go.
###1044 I'm the one who dented moms car.
###1046 What?
###1047 - It happened the other day while you were asleep.
###1049 Kevin was going to wake you up because he wanted
###1051 To go outside and go skateboarding,
###1052 But your car was parked inside the driveway,
###1055 So I just thought I'd move it for you,
###1057 And I backed into a fire hydrant.
###1059 - Girl, I should whup... - No, let me.
###1062 I got this. - No, no, no.
###1063 Baby, run! Run! Go, Lindsey!
###1065 - Yeah, you know... you better move.
###1067 And try not to hit anything!
###1069 - <i>don't back into a fire hydrant</i>
###1071 Wasn't on your <i>checklist</i>?
###1073 - Oh, don't put this on me, Suzanne.
###1076 Look, if you wasn't so busy working
###1078 On Kevin's science project, you wouldn't have fell asleep,
###1080 And she wouldn't have had to move the car.
###1082 - Oh, so now this is my fault?
###1085 - It's not about whose fault it is.
###1087 But if it was...
###1089 It'd be yours.
###1091 Look, you ain't no different than the girl
###1093 With the parents and the party.
###1095 - Yes, I am. - How?
###1097 - I ain't got to explain myself to you.
###1100 - Oh, that's real mature.
###1103 You can't hide from the truth, Suzanne.
###1109 - Give me two minutes, please.
###1113 - Hey, man.
###1116 You remember me?
###1117 - No.
###1119 - The prius.
###1120 - No.
###1121 - The blue sweater.
###1122 - No.
###1124 - We got in an argument.
###1125 - No.
###1126 - I walked away.
###1128 - You... let me see. Turn around.
###1130 - Oh, the meats in the back of your neck.
###1131 I remember.
###1132 I remember you. - Okay.
###1135 - Blue sweater. - Yeah, yeah.
###1136 - Prius. - Yes.
###1138 - Dent. - Okay.
###1139 - Argument. - Yeah.
###1140 Um, look, look.
###1141 I... I came down here to apologize for how things went.
###1146 All right?
###1147 It turns out you didn't dent my car.
###1149 - Of course I didn't.
###1150 And if I did, I'm not responsible.
###1154 Who dented the car?
###1155 - My daughter.
###1156 - Hey! What did she hit?
###1159 - A fire hydrant.
###1160 - Hey!
###1162 Let me get this straight.
###1164 So you come here and accuse me, and all this time,
###1167 The criminal is in your own house.
###1169 I should sue you for defamation of character.
###1172 - Listen, I'm sorry you feel that way, man.
###1174 That's why I'm... that's why I'm here.
###1175 - I don't want to hear it.
###1177 You're like Sarah Palin, and I'm like Barack Obama.
###1179 And your daughter, she's George Bush.
###1181 Everything's her fault, but who they blame?
###1183 Me, the black man.
###1184 - Why are you talking about my daughter?
###1186 She don't got nothing to do with this right here.
###1188 - You mean a criminal that can't drive?
###1190 I have 13 daughters, and all can drive.
###1191 What's wrong with yours?
###1192 - Listen, man.
###1194 Look, she took responsibility for her actions.
###1196 Why don't you take responsibility for yours?
###1197 - I don't have to. It's in the ticket.
###1200 I'm not responsible for anything.
###1201 I'll read this to you.
###1202 <i>pursuant to law, operator's liabilities</i>
###1205 <i>for laws on damages to vehicles by fire...</i>
###1209 - Yeah, okay.
###1210 - <i>theft, explosion.</i> - Okay.
###1212 - Boom! - Yeah.
###1214 - Key rust. - Okay, look, look.
###1216 I know, all right? I know.
###1217 How can you open a business and then write on a piece
###1220 Of paper that you have no idea what you're doing
