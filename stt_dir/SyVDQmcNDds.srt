We have
a big problem here, girls.


2
0:0:32,879 --> 0:0:36,483
Your behavior is
completely unacceptable.


3
0:0:36,483 --> 0:0:38,719
Mr. Connor...


4
0:0:38,719 --> 0:0:40,587
Did we do something wrong?


5
0:0:40,587 --> 0:0:42,823
The three of you have
been disrupting my class


6
0:0:42,823 --> 0:0:44,691
and you're making it difficult
for the students


7
0:0:44,691 --> 0:0:47,928
who actually want
to learn something.


8
0:0:47,928 --> 0:0:50,464
Not only am l going
to call your parents,


9
0:0:50,464 --> 0:0:53,934
but you all have detention.


10
0:0:53,934 --> 0:0:57,3
Not only am l gonna
call your parents...


11
0:0:57,3 --> 0:0:59,106
But you all have detention.


12

You've got detention
You've got detention


13
0:1:5,145 --> 0:1:9,216
You girls think this is funny?


14
0:1:9,216 --> 0:1:10,65
No, Jim!


15
0:1:10,65 --> 0:1:14,821
l don't find anything
funny about this.


16
0:1:14,821 --> 0:1:17,858
l wasn't finished!


17
0:1:17,858 --> 0:1:18,825
Put these on!


18
0:1:18,825 --> 0:1:21,161
l don't think these
are appropriate to wear here.


19
0:1:21,161 --> 0:1:24,297
You fucking imbecile,
did l stutter?!


20
0:1:24,297 --> 0:1:25,599
l said put 'em on.


21
0:1:25,599 --> 0:1:27,267
This is outrageous!


22
0:1:27,267 --> 0:1:30,437
l'm just trying to give
you girls a good education!


23
0:1:30,437 --> 0:1:31,705
Ooooh...

0:1:38,712 --> 0:1:39,946
Just let me go!


27
0:1:39,946 --> 0:1:45,852
Somebody really needs detention.


28
0:1:45,852 --> 0:1:47,854
That was fun, right?


29
0:1:47,854 --> 0:1:50,123
Yeah, that was crazy.


30
0:1:50,123 --> 0:1:52,392
l love it when it's
the three of us together.


31
0:1:52,392 --> 0:1:55,829
lt's like Charlie's Angels,
look out!


32
0:1:55,829 --> 0:1:57,664
More like Hells Angels.


33
0:1:57,664 --> 0:1:59,99
And Natalie...


34
0:1:59,99 --> 0:2:3,136
that dildo was way too big
to use on him like that.


35
0:2:3,136 --> 0:2:5,539
But l think he liked it
the way he was moaning.


36
0:2:5,539 --> 0:2:7,14
You think he liked it?


37
0:2:7,14 --> 0:2:10,43
Who cares.
l liked it.


38
0:2:10,43 --> 0:2:11,378
Are you girls hungry?


39
0:2:11,378 --> 0:2:15,449
So hungry l could eat
the balls off a snake right now.


40
0:2:15,449 --> 0:2:19,319
You know, l have the strangest
craving for foie gras.


41
0:2:19,319 --> 0:2:21,254
Eew! That's nasty!


42
0:2:21,254 --> 0:2:23,857
The way they force-feed
those poor little geese -


43
0:2:23,857 --> 0:2:25,625
it's animal cruelty, you know.


44
0:2:25,625 --> 0:2:28,195
Honey, you the last one to
be talking about animal cruelty


45
0:2:28,195 --> 0:2:31,198
after what you just
did to that poor man.


46
0:2:31,198 --> 0:2:36,803
Ashtray.


47
0:2:36,803 --> 0:2:38,638

Do l have any new bookings?

You have Tony at 3 o'clock...

into latex fetish
and heavy bondage,


57
0:2:57,491 --> 0:3:0,66
and Karen and her
husband want to push to 7.


58
0:3:0,66 --> 0:3:3,29
- Can you e-mail me that to me?
- Sure.


59
0:3:3,29 --> 0:3:4,664
Jim should be ready.


60
0:3:4,664 --> 0:3:7,868
Let me write him up
so you can get out of here.


61
0:3:7,868 --> 0:3:9,803
All right, we got
an all-girl gang bang,


62

Ah! Face slapping...

0:3:24,451 --> 0:3:26,653
basic trampling and a golden.


68
0:3:26,653 --> 0:3:27,888
Any takers?

Nah, l'm good.

l'll see you later.


85
0:5:50,463 --> 0:5:52,666
Natalie, l think you should
go back to being blond


86
0:5:52,666 --> 0:5:54,3
or at least put some blond
highlights in your hair.


87
0:5:54,3 --> 0:5:55,802
lt looked so beautiful that way.


88
0:5:55,802 --> 0:5:58,138
Thanks, Ma, but the bleach
dried out my hair.


89
0:5:58,138 --> 0:5:59,272
l like it better natural.


90
0:5:59,272 --> 0:6:1,174
Ma, she looks
beautiful the way she is.


91
0:6:1,174 --> 0:6:3,476
l know she does.


92
0:6:3,476 --> 0:6:5,145
What's going on with your hair?


93
0:6:5,145 --> 0:6:6,546
l just got it cut this morning.


94
0:6:6,546 --> 0:6:7,914
lt's a little too short,
isn't it?


95
0:6:7,914 --> 0:6:9,549
l mean, just don't go
any shorter.


96
0:6:9,549 --> 0:6:12,52
l've been getting my hair cut
like this for a year.


97
0:6:12,52 --> 0:6:13,787
Nat, you think it's too short?


98
0:6:13,787 --> 0:6:17,157
No, it looks real cute.
l like that dykie look.

0:6:17,157 --> 0:6:18,224
What?


100

l mean, if l saw you
on the street


101
0:6:20,36 --> 0:6:27,634
l'd definitely think
you were gay.


102
0:6:27,634 --> 0:6:30,336
Natalie, not everybody
sees things the way you do.


103
0:6:30,336 --> 0:6:32,872
Maybe it's not about the hair.


104
0:6:32,872 --> 0:6:34,24
Then what is it?


105
0:6:34,24 --> 0:6:35,909
You know what it is?


106
0:6:35,909 --> 0:6:38,812
lt's the hair with the clothes,
it's the way you carry yourself.


107
0:6:38,812 --> 0:6:40,413
Everything about you screams,


108
0:6:40,413 --> 0:6:42,282
''l don't need a man.''


109
0:6:42,282 --> 0:6:46,119
Some people might
confuse that with being gay.

walk around town

the film business, Ma.


132

Well, that's something new.

Now, l know you don't
wanna hear this,


134
0:7:44,577 --> 0:7:46,846
but l think it would be nice
if one of you young ladies


135
0:7:46,846 --> 0:7:49,516
would just start to think
about settling down


136
0:7:49,516 --> 0:7:52,285

l want someone
to call me Grandma

- Nana!
- That's not funny.


144
0:8:4,33 --> 0:8:6,666
- Granny!
- OK!


145
0:8:6,666 --> 0:8:8,268
OK, fine.


146
0:8:8,268 --> 0:8:10,47
Can we change the subject?

0:9:15,168 --> 0:9:16,569
ln the bedroom?


169

She turned the extra room
into a dungeon


170
0:9:18,304 --> 0:9:24,777
so she could get some
work done on the side.


171
0:9:24,777 --> 0:9:33,186
- Hey, baby.

Why can't we go
to a straight club?


180

And l'm going crazy!


221

That's what l really need.

client of mine.

the corner from you, girl.


248
0:12:49,48 --> 0:12:50,95
Really? l didn't know that.


249
0:12:50,95 --> 0:12:53,619
How long have you lived there?


250
0:12:53,619 --> 0:12:55,655
How long?
Shit...


251
0:12:55,655 --> 0:12:57,657
Let me put it to you this way.


252
0:12:57,657 --> 0:12:59,492
l remember when the
neighborhood was nothin'


253
0:12:59,492 --> 0:13:2,829
but abandoned buildings and
crackheads and dope fiends...


254
0:13:2,829 --> 0:13:5,765
before these yuppie bastards
and trust-fund babies


255
0:13:5,765 --> 0:13:8,568

my once quaint little 'hood.


256
0:13:8,568 --> 0:13:11,3
l know you're not tryin'
to call me a Yuppie!


257
0:13:11,3 --> 0:13:12,972
No, l ain't tryin to say
you're no yuppie.


258
0:13:12,972 --> 0:13:15,41
l'm just sayin' they took all
the hustle off the street,


259
0:13:15,41 --> 0:13:16,843
which is cool,
but they also put out


260
0:13:16,843 --> 0:13:18,911
all the working class people
on their asses.


261
0:13:18,911 --> 0:13:20,246
Yeah, it's fucked up.


262
0:13:20,246 --> 0:13:22,882
Now me, l just had to evolve
my game a little bit.


263
0:13:22,882 --> 0:13:24,35
lnstead of hangin' out
on the corner


264
0:13:24,35 --> 0:13:26,686
and y'all comin to me,
l come to you.


265
0:13:26,686 --> 0:13:28,988
Our friendly
neighborhood delivery man.


266
0:13:28,988 --> 0:13:31,524
Tips are appreciated.


267
0:13:31,524 --> 0:13:32,892
But for real...


268
0:13:32,892 --> 0:13:36,28
this is just a little side
hustle to keep the lights on.


269
0:13:36,28 --> 0:13:37,163
You feel me?


270
0:13:37,163 --> 0:13:38,464
ln here...


271
0:13:38,464 --> 0:13:40,266
tryin' to do that artist thing.


272
0:13:40,266 --> 0:13:42,835
Oh, OK.
What kind of artist?


273
0:13:42,835 --> 0:13:44,57
l used to do a little taggin'
back in the day.


274
0:13:44,57 --> 0:13:46,806
l parlayed that into a little
bit of paintin',


275
0:13:46,806 --> 0:13:48,241
little bit of rhymin'.


276
0:13:48,241 --> 0:13:50,209
But the thing that's
really settin' me off...


277
0:13:50,209 --> 0:13:52,278
is this writin' thing...


278
0:13:52,278 --> 0:13:54,68
Like what?
A book? Poetry?


279
0:13:54,68 --> 0:13:57,49
Screenplays....


280
0:13:57,49 --> 0:13:58,718
And from pen to pad, girl,

282
0:14:1,22 --> 0:14:5,591
Hey, aren't you working on
something like that?


283

little Miss Tarantino.

Yeah, l'm workin' on

285
0:14:11,497 --> 0:14:13,633
Then you guys should
totally collaborate


286
0:14:13,633 --> 0:14:16,35
on something really fabulous.


287
0:14:16,35 --> 0:14:18,437
Collaboration, huh?


288
0:14:18,437 --> 0:14:21,407
You like brown babies?


289
0:14:21,407 --> 0:14:22,875
That's what's up!


290
0:14:22,875 --> 0:14:25,878
ln the meantime, how about
we collaborate on this L?


291
0:14:25,878 --> 0:14:31,83
Here you go.


292
0:14:31,83 --> 0:14:32,552

297

Most definitely.


298
0:14:46,299 --> 0:14:47,7
Big Pimpin' for sure!


299
0:14:47,7 --> 0:14:53,206
Hey Pimpstress,

300
0:14:53,206 --> 0:14:55,107

309
0:15:11,157 --> 0:15:13,192
He was one of the
revolutionary artists

by the government


311
0:15:15,394 --> 0:15:17,23

Now l'm not talkin' about
the way they died,


320
0:15:32,645 --> 0:15:33,913
but at the time,


321
0:15:33,913 --> 0:15:35,715
all at the height
of their careers,


322
0:15:35,715 --> 0:15:37,49
when they had
the most influence


323
0:15:37,49 --> 0:15:39,452

revolutionary generation!


324
0:15:39,452 --> 0:15:40,486

0:24:10,429 --> 0:24:11,73
Do you have a tampon?


391
0:24:11,73 --> 0:24:14,6
ln the cabinet, under the sink.


392
0:24:14,6 --> 0:24:16,668
Where are we, anyway?


393
0:24:16,668 --> 0:24:32,618
Lower East Side.


394
0:24:32,618 --> 0:24:34,987
So, l'll call you.


395
0:24:34,987 --> 0:24:44,463
Yeah, you'll call me.


396
0:24:44,463 --> 0:24:48,233
[phone rings]


397
0:24:48,233 --> 0:24:49,101
Hello?


398
0:24:49,101 --> 0:24:50,736
- Hey.
- Hey.


399
0:24:50,736 --> 0:24:52,337
What a surprise.


400
0:24:52,337 --> 0:24:54,74
l didn't expect to
hear from you so soon.


401
0:24:54,74 --> 0:24:56,441
Yeah, l know.


402
0:24:56,441 --> 0:24:58,71
The rules and all...
but l just wanted to say


403
0:24:58,71 --> 0:25:1,146
l had a really good time
with you last night.


404
0:25:1,146 --> 0:25:5,25
Yeah, me too.


405
0:25:5,25 --> 0:25:17,763
Bye.


406
0:25:17,763 --> 0:25:20,165
So, how was it last night?


407
0:25:20,165 --> 0:25:22,634
AKA, this morning?


408
0:25:22,634 --> 0:25:25,304
And don't leave out
the hot details.


409
0:25:25,304 --> 0:25:28,6
Well, put it this way...


410
0:25:28,6 --> 0:25:31,176
she ate my cookies
until the box was empty.


411
0:25:31,176 --> 0:25:33,178
Now that's what
l'm talking about!


412
0:25:33,178 --> 0:25:35,447
l won't get with a chick
if the sex ain't right!


413
0:25:35,447 --> 0:25:36,949
lt's all about the pussy!


414
0:25:36,949 --> 0:25:38,784
That's the real way
to a woman's heart.


415
0:25:38,784 --> 0:25:41,86
True. l'm definitely
gonna see her again.


416
0:25:41,86 --> 0:25:42,387
Well, hell yeah!


417
0:25:42,387 --> 0:25:46,658
You'd better see her...
before someone else sees her.


418
0:25:46,658 --> 0:25:48,827
The Viking Killer.


419
0:25:48,827 --> 0:25:53,799
Very useful if you're
trying to stretch him out.


420
0:25:53,799 --> 0:25:55,267
Does she know you're a domme?


421
0:25:55,267 --> 0:25:55,968
Nah.


422
0:25:55,968 --> 0:25:58,36
That shouldn't be a problem.
She seems mad chill.


423
0:25:58,36 --> 0:25:59,238
l don't know, babe,


424
0:25:59,238 --> 0:26:1,64
usually it's only
a matter of time...


425
0:26:1,64 --> 0:26:4,943
unless you find someone
who thinks it's normal.


426
0:26:4,943 --> 0:26:6,979
Who would think this is normal?


427
0:26:6,979 --> 0:26:10,215
l do.


428
0:26:10,215 --> 0:26:12,351
Yeah, but eventually
l wanna have


429
0:26:12,351 --> 0:26:15,22
a serious and
normal relationship.


430
0:26:15,22 --> 0:26:16,922
With a girl, of course.


431
0:26:16,922 --> 0:26:19,524
You just need someone
that's open-minded.


432
0:26:19,524 --> 0:26:22,794
Or a domme who understands.


433
0:26:22,794 --> 0:26:26,265
We are doing exactly
what we want to be doing.


434
0:26:26,265 --> 0:26:28,66
How many people can say that?


435
0:26:28,66 --> 0:26:30,35
That's true, but...


436
0:26:30,35 --> 0:26:31,77
l don't think l'm
gonna be doin' this


437
0:26:31,77 --> 0:26:33,205
for too much longer.


438
0:26:33,205 --> 0:26:35,207
l want to go back
to nursing school,


439
0:26:35,207 --> 0:26:39,211
and l wanna have
a wifey and a kid.


440
0:26:39,211 --> 0:26:40,812
Really?


441
0:26:40,812 --> 0:26:43,382
l could see that.
You'd be a cute mommy.


442
0:26:43,382 --> 0:26:45,751
Yeah.


443
0:26:45,751 --> 0:26:49,521
But for now just remember,
we're alternative therapists.


444
0:26:49,521 --> 0:26:58,597
And this is our
contribution to society, right?


445
0:26:58,597 --> 0:26:59,298
[knock on door]


446
0:26:59,298 --> 0:27:1,133
lt's open!


447
0:27:1,133 --> 0:27:3,869
Hey, hey, hey!
What's up, girl?


448
0:27:3,869 --> 0:27:7,372
Hi.


449
0:27:7,372 --> 0:27:12,778
Got some presents for you.


450
0:27:12,778 --> 0:27:15,38
- All right.
- No. l want that one.


451
0:27:15,38 --> 0:27:19,584
OK.


452
0:27:19,584 --> 0:27:24,89
- You wanna stay?
- Hell, yeah.


453
0:27:24,89 --> 0:27:25,724
What's up with that
little dime piece


454
0:27:25,724 --> 0:27:27,259
you broke out with
the other night?


455
0:27:27,259 --> 0:27:28,327
You in love yet?


456
0:27:28,327 --> 0:27:29,394
Shut the fuck up.


457
0:27:29,394 --> 0:27:32,197
You know how you lez out
at lighting speed.


458
0:27:32,197 --> 0:27:34,66
What's up with your script?


459
0:27:34,66 --> 0:27:35,934
Well, y'all inspire me,


460
0:27:35,934 --> 0:27:38,37
so l been writin' down
some new ideas.


461
0:27:38,37 --> 0:27:39,538
What's it about?


462
0:27:39,538 --> 0:27:42,641
lt's kind of
a 'slice of life' thing...


463
0:27:42,641 --> 0:27:46,111
about being happy
and an individual.


464
0:27:46,111 --> 0:27:47,679
ls that it?


465
0:27:47,679 --> 0:27:52,818
- Yeah.
- Cool.


466
0:27:52,818 --> 0:28:6,131
l just been fuckin' around
with some dialogue.


467
0:28:6,131 --> 0:28:7,432
What, what?


468
0:28:7,432 --> 0:28:9,634
That's pretty funny.


469
0:28:9,634 --> 0:28:12,4
But a woman
wouldn't say it like that.


470
0:28:12,4 --> 0:28:15,54
That sounds like a dude.


471
0:28:15,54 --> 0:28:16,575
Do you mind?


472
0:28:16,575 --> 0:28:32,491
No, go ahead.


473
0:28:32,491 --> 0:28:40,799
That's tight.


474
0:28:40,799 --> 0:28:42,901
How about we change
this whole scene?


475
0:28:42,901 --> 0:28:44,136
Yeah, l was thinkin'


476
0:28:44,136 --> 0:28:45,604
we should have her
shit on him.


477
0:28:45,604 --> 0:28:47,172
They're not ready for that!


478
0:28:47,172 --> 0:28:48,34
No, it would be cool,


479
0:28:48,34 --> 0:28:50,275
'cuz l ain't never seen that
in a movie before.


480
0:28:50,275 --> 0:28:53,11
Yeah, there's a reason;
nobody wants to see that shit.


481
0:28:53,11 --> 0:28:54,88
l do.


482
0:28:54,88 --> 0:28:58,5
- No hot lunches!
- All right.


483
0:28:58,5 --> 0:29:1,82
Wee!


484
0:29:1,82 --> 0:29:4,556
Damn, girl, you crazy.


485
0:29:4,556 --> 0:29:8,26

Slingin' drinks?


532
0:31:18,523 --> 0:31:20,225
Don't tell me

0:33:30,255 --> 0:33:32,157
Do l get the same guarantee?


583
0:33:32,157 --> 0:33:33,925
l play for the home team...


584
0:33:33,925 --> 0:33:35,794
You know my shit
is always guaranteed.


585
0:33:35,794 --> 0:33:37,696
Whatever.
Just get the fuck out of here.


586
0:33:37,696 --> 0:33:39,531
Some of us have
some real work to do.


587
0:33:39,531 --> 0:33:42,5
All right...
Look, Mike...


588
0:33:42,5 --> 0:33:43,335
Forgive me...


589
0:33:43,335 --> 0:33:45,103
l know you must get
this all the time,


590
0:33:45,103 --> 0:33:47,839
but l got this
great idea for a script.


591
0:33:47,839 --> 0:33:50,41
Oh, great. Another script.
Just what l need.


592
0:33:50,41 --> 0:33:51,943
lt's in the beginning stages,
but l was hopin'


593
0:33:51,943 --> 0:33:53,545
you'd take look at it
when l'm finished.


594
0:33:53,545 --> 0:33:54,879
Finish?


595
0:33:54,879 --> 0:33:58,149
lf you ever finish,
it'll get thrown onto a pile


596
0:33:58,149 --> 0:34:0,652
with a million other scripts
after a million re-writes


597
0:34:0,652 --> 0:34:3,288
and then some sweet-ass
little intern will read it


598
0:34:3,288 --> 0:34:5,957
and steal your fucking idea!


599
0:34:5,957 --> 0:34:7,959
Look, Nomar--


600
0:34:7,959 --> 0:34:9,361
Noah.


601
0:34:9,361 --> 0:34:10,895
l know.


602
0:34:10,895 --> 0:34:12,864
You're always on time
and your weed's pretty good,


603
0:34:12,864 --> 0:34:14,99
so stick to your day job


604
0:34:14,99 --> 0:34:15,967
and leave the movie making
to us professionals!


605
0:34:15,967 --> 0:34:18,737
OK, Spike Lee?


606
0:34:18,737 --> 0:34:20,171
OK.


607
0:34:20,171 --> 0:34:22,474
Success and nothin' less,
my man.


608
0:34:22,474 --> 0:34:27,112
Yeah, whatever.


609
0:34:27,112 --> 0:34:28,98
Close the fucking door!


610
0:34:28,98 --> 0:34:33,151
Were you born in a tent?


611
0:34:33,151 --> 0:34:40,692
Close the door!


612
0:34:40,692 --> 0:34:42,627
And then it got stuck.


613
0:34:42,627 --> 0:34:44,95
Stuck?


614
0:34:44,95 --> 0:34:46,865
Up his ass.


615
0:34:46,865 --> 0:34:48,6
l hate stickys.


616
0:34:48,6 --> 0:34:51,202
He was jumping up and down
and everything,


617
0:34:51,202 --> 0:34:53,405
but his ass just
swallowed it whole.


618
0:34:53,405 --> 0:34:55,73
Did you try the forceps?


619
0:34:55,73 --> 0:34:57,876
Of course.
lt was in way too deep.


620
0:34:57,876 --> 0:35:0,512
Birthing position?
Squatting position?


621
0:35:0,512 --> 0:35:2,881
- Hospital?
- Had to.


622
0:35:2,881 --> 0:35:4,282
St. Vincent's or Roosevelt?


623
0:35:4,282 --> 0:35:5,55
St. Vincent's...


624
0:35:5,55 --> 0:35:8,119
They have a lot of experience
with this type of thing.


625
0:35:8,119 --> 0:35:10,54
OK, this is disgusting.


626
0:35:10,54 --> 0:35:11,99
Honey, they love it.


627
0:35:11,99 --> 0:35:14,192
Damn, these dudes will have
you do anything they want.


628
0:35:14,192 --> 0:35:15,56
You got it twisted.


629
0:35:15,56 --> 0:35:17,695
Even if they come in
for something specific,


630
0:35:17,695 --> 0:35:19,197
l just figure out
their weakness


631
0:35:19,197 --> 0:35:21,132
and get them to do
whatever l want.


632
0:35:21,132 --> 0:35:22,534
So let me get this straight.


633
0:35:22,534 --> 0:35:24,135
They tell you
what they want,


634
0:35:24,135 --> 0:35:25,703
but then you don't do it?


635
0:35:25,703 --> 0:35:28,173
Well, every Mistress
has her methods.


636
0:35:28,173 --> 0:35:29,841
l like to expand their horizons.


637
0:35:29,841 --> 0:35:31,142
You're doin'
a whole lot more


638
0:35:31,142 --> 0:35:32,644
than expanding their horizons.


639
0:35:32,644 --> 0:35:34,279
They love this shit.


640
0:35:34,279 --> 0:35:36,514
lt sounds like you all love it.


641
0:35:36,514 --> 0:35:37,916
They love it!


642
0:35:37,916 --> 0:35:40,585
l just think we're all goddesses
and men should be serving us.


643
0:35:40,585 --> 0:35:42,887
- Amen.
- Yeah!


644
0:35:42,887 --> 0:35:57,969
Yeah!


645
0:35:57,969 --> 0:35:59,537
OK, great.


646
0:35:59,537 --> 0:36:1,39
l'll see you tomorrow.


647
0:36:1,39 --> 0:36:5,9
Thanks so much.


648
0:36:5,9 --> 0:36:6,644
What's up, mama?


649
0:36:6,644 --> 0:36:7,946
l just got an interview


650
0:36:7,946 --> 0:36:10,849
to possibly intern
on a feature film tomorrow.


651
0:36:10,849 --> 0:36:12,383
Ooh!


652
0:36:12,383 --> 0:36:15,687
Oh, my God.
l'm so happy for you.


653
0:36:15,687 --> 0:36:17,388
Good luck.


654
0:36:17,388 --> 0:36:18,79
Thanks.


655
0:36:18,79 --> 0:36:22,861
lf l get it, we'll have
to celebrate this weekend.


656
0:36:22,861 --> 0:36:26,264
Well, l just hope
you put some money aside,


657
0:36:26,264 --> 0:36:27,899
'cuz, you know...


658
0:36:27,899 --> 0:36:29,801
being a domme spoils you.


659
0:36:29,801 --> 0:36:31,569
l mean...


660
0:36:31,569 --> 0:36:33,171
You are gonna make
in a week


661
0:36:33,171 --> 0:36:36,7
what you can make
in an hour doing this.


662
0:36:36,7 --> 0:36:39,143
That's why eventually,
everyone comes back.


663
0:36:39,143 --> 0:36:42,413
Yeah, l know, but...
l gotta try.


664
0:36:42,413 --> 0:36:45,717
And you are trying!
That's awesome.


665
0:36:45,717 --> 0:36:49,12
But when you do come back,


666
0:36:49,12 --> 0:36:54,893
l'll be here to welcome you
and tell you it's OK.


667
0:36:54,893 --> 0:36:57,228
l never said l was quitting...


668
0:36:57,228 --> 0:37:0,31
Just takin' a break.


669
0:37:0,31 --> 0:37:3,501
He said he wants
to be mummified!


670
0:37:3,501 --> 0:37:5,336
What should l do?!


671
0:37:5,336 --> 0:37:7,71
Wrap him up in Saran Wrap.


672
0:37:7,71 --> 0:37:9,207
Waist up first,
then the bottom half.


673
0:37:9,207 --> 0:37:11,109
Just remember to cut
air holes for the head.


674
0:37:11,109 --> 0:37:12,277
Tape 'em up.


675
0:37:12,277 --> 0:37:20,852
Oh...OK.
Thanks.


676
0:37:20,852 --> 0:37:22,387
Wow...


677
0:37:22,387 --> 0:37:24,789
You look amazing,
you little shit.


678
0:37:24,789 --> 0:37:26,424
Thanks.


679
0:37:26,424 --> 0:37:28,59
lt doesn't even look like me.


680
0:37:28,59 --> 0:37:29,794
No, it doesn't!


681
0:37:29,794 --> 0:37:31,195
What are you wearing?


682
0:37:31,195 --> 0:37:32,964
Fetish gear.


683
0:37:32,964 --> 0:37:35,5
Oh, my God.


684
0:37:35,5 --> 0:37:37,302
Has Mommy seen this yet?


685
0:37:37,302 --> 0:37:43,374
Yeah. She wants a copy.


686
0:37:43,374 --> 0:37:45,41
So who's this new girl
you're in love with?


687
0:37:45,41 --> 0:37:47,946
- What new girl?
- Oh, c'mon.


688
0:37:47,946 --> 0:37:50,14
Her name is Jasmine.


689
0:37:50,14 --> 0:37:52,717
She's wonderful.
l met her at Juicy's.


690
0:37:52,717 --> 0:37:54,719
Does she know what you do?


691
0:37:54,719 --> 0:37:58,356
Yeah. She doesn't care.


692
0:37:58,356 --> 0:38:1,826
Really?


693
0:38:1,826 --> 0:38:17,976
That's great.


694
0:38:17,976 --> 0:38:19,978
Hey!


695
0:38:19,978 --> 0:38:21,813
l got hung up at work.


696
0:38:21,813 --> 0:38:24,916
OK.


697
0:38:24,916 --> 0:38:26,25
Are you OK?


698
0:38:26,25 --> 0:38:27,986
Yeah.


699
0:38:27,986 --> 0:38:29,12
You sure?


700
0:38:29,12 --> 0:38:31,155
Yeah.


701
0:38:31,155 --> 0:38:32,523
What's up?


702
0:38:32,523 --> 0:38:37,562
Nothin.


703
0:38:37,562 --> 0:38:38,963
A'ight.


704
0:38:38,963 --> 0:38:40,865
You know
l'm feelin' you, right?


705
0:38:40,865 --> 0:38:42,433
Yeah.


706
0:38:42,433 --> 0:38:45,303
When l met you
l didn't think l'd care,


707
0:38:45,303 --> 0:38:47,38
but the more l'm feelin' you


708
0:38:47,38 --> 0:38:49,273
the more it's starting
to bother me.


709
0:38:49,273 --> 0:38:51,42
l don't know how long
l can deal with


710
0:38:51,42 --> 0:38:53,144
this stuff that you do.


711
0:38:53,144 --> 0:38:55,246
lt's fuckin' with my head.


712
0:38:55,246 --> 0:38:56,648
Really?


713
0:38:56,648 --> 0:38:58,716
Yeah.


714
0:38:58,716 --> 0:39:0,585
Do you like it?


715
0:39:0,585 --> 0:39:4,88
l mean, do you get off on it
or is just your job?


716
0:39:4,88 --> 0:39:6,57
To be honest...


717
0:39:6,57 --> 0:39:8,526
it's a little of all three.


718
0:39:8,526 --> 0:39:12,43
Look, it's what l do.


719
0:39:12,43 --> 0:39:15,133
lt's what l chose to do
way before l met you.


720
0:39:15,133 --> 0:39:16,34
l know.


721
0:39:16,34 --> 0:39:17,368
l'm just tryin'
to be honest with you


722
0:39:17,368 --> 0:39:19,3
and tell you how l feel.


723
0:39:19,3 --> 0:39:22,507
And l want you to be honest,
but don't judge me.


724
0:39:22,507 --> 0:39:24,242
No. no. l'm not.


725
0:39:24,242 --> 0:39:26,377
l think you're really
creative and smart.


726
0:39:26,377 --> 0:39:28,279
l feel like there's so much
more to you


727
0:39:28,279 --> 0:39:30,415
than just beating
men's asses...


728
0:39:30,415 --> 0:39:32,984
Even though most men
need their asses beat.


729
0:39:32,984 --> 0:39:36,721
But you know what l'm sayin'.


730
0:39:36,721 --> 0:39:39,157
Look, Noah's hooking me
up on a job


731
0:39:39,157 --> 0:39:42,326
one of his customers
is directing.


732
0:39:42,326 --> 0:39:43,928
Are you serious?


733
0:39:43,928 --> 0:39:46,264
Why didn't you tell me?
That's what l'm talkin' about.


734
0:39:46,264 --> 0:39:48,366
lt's just as an intern.
l'm not even hired yet.


735
0:39:48,366 --> 0:39:50,234
No, but you're on your way!


736
0:39:50,234 --> 0:39:56,24
Yes!


737
0:39:56,24 --> 0:39:57,942
[machine beeps]
Natalie...


738
0:39:57,942 --> 0:40:1,813
He said he called you
but you're not calling him back.


739
0:40:1,813 --> 0:40:3,314
What's going on?


740
0:40:3,314 --> 0:40:6,617
l wanna live long enough
to be a great-grandmother.


741
0:40:6,617 --> 0:40:8,553
Why aren't you calling him back?


742
0:40:8,553 --> 0:40:9,787
What's good, baby girl?


743
0:40:9,787 --> 0:40:11,122
Noah!


744
0:40:11,122 --> 0:40:13,124
Thank you so much
for hooking that up.


745
0:40:13,124 --> 0:40:14,692
- All right.
- l hope l get it.


746
0:40:14,692 --> 0:40:17,28
We'll see if you thank me
after you meet him.


747
0:40:17,28 --> 0:40:18,529
He's a real dickhead.


748
0:40:18,529 --> 0:40:20,231
Whatever, l'm sure
l can handle him.


749
0:40:20,231 --> 0:40:21,365
All right.


750
0:40:21,365 --> 0:40:26,37
How bad can he be?


751
0:40:26,37 --> 0:40:27,939
You got somethin' new?


752
0:40:27,939 --> 0:40:29,6
Yeah.


753
0:40:29,6 --> 0:40:32,21
l was thinkin' that Natalie
needs to be more vulnerable.


754
0:40:32,21 --> 0:40:33,211
You understand?


755
0:40:33,211 --> 0:40:35,246
Like, we have to have her
learn something.


756
0:40:35,246 --> 0:40:37,148
Dude, we have to
change her name.


757
0:40:37,148 --> 0:40:39,45
- Why?
- Because that's what you do.


758
0:40:39,45 --> 0:40:41,786
You don't use your own name
in a movie based on yourself.


759
0:40:41,786 --> 0:40:44,21
l wanna use my name.
l'm proud of my shit.


760
0:40:44,21 --> 0:40:46,858
lt's unprofessional.


761
0:40:46,858 --> 0:40:49,594
Done.


762
0:40:49,594 --> 0:40:52,163
l can not wait till we get
this shit in the can.


763
0:40:52,163 --> 0:40:53,731
l can stop sellin' weed,


764
0:40:53,731 --> 0:40:55,733
you could stop
beatin' dudes up.


765
0:40:55,733 --> 0:40:56,968
l like beating dudes up.


766
0:40:56,968 --> 0:40:58,236
And l like selling weed.


767
0:40:58,236 --> 0:41:0,538
But l do see bigger
and better things for us.


768
0:41:0,538 --> 0:41:2,874
Let me see if l can
get this internship first.


769
0:41:2,874 --> 0:41:4,75
All right, cool.
l like that.


770
0:41:4,75 --> 0:41:7,44
Baby steps...
baby steps!


771
0:41:7,44 --> 0:41:8,45
You ready?


772
0:41:8,45 --> 0:41:13,751
Yeah, come on.
Next scene.


773
0:41:13,751 --> 0:41:20,358

0:45:59,804 --> 0:46:1,906
Why?


863
0:46:1,906 --> 0:46:4,241
You know l'm interning

0:46:4,241 --> 0:46:7,511
This isn't about the money.

it doesn't even bother you!

875
0:46:52,623 --> 0:46:54,492
This is not part
of our arrangement.

What more do you want?

you think of what l bought


883
0:47:12,443 --> 0:47:13,911
with your hard-earned money.


884

But Ashley,

885
0:47:15,513 --> 0:47:16,647
Then you better get started.


886

Ashley, please don't
do this to me.


887
0:47:17,882 --> 0:47:19,884
This is not cool.
l really gotta go.


888
0:47:19,884 --> 0:47:21,185
Perhaps we should
play the video of

0:47:21,185 --> 0:47:25,422

at your board meeting.


890
0:47:25,422 --> 0:47:42,106

a woman's opinion.


901
0:48:29,82 --> 0:48:31,288
Excuse me.


902
0:48:31,288 --> 0:48:33,9

l guess you could say
l have a little shoe fetish.


908
0:48:46,437 --> 0:48:49,64
Right, Jim?


909
0:48:49,64 --> 0:48:53,51
Now take out that next box.


910
0:48:53,51 --> 0:48:57,414
Not that one.
The other one.


911
0:48:57,414 --> 0:48:58,616

a foot massage.


914
0:49:3,287 --> 0:49:6,29
Why are you doing this to me?


915

be a filmmaker


965
0:52:3,6 --> 0:52:5,35
you just gotta go for it.


966
0:52:5,35 --> 0:52:8,705
Don't let anything
or anyone stop you.


967
0:52:8,705 --> 0:52:10,707
And believe me...


968
0:52:10,707 --> 0:52:12,509
They will try and stop you!


969
0:52:12,509 --> 0:52:13,644
Yeah?


970
0:52:13,644 --> 0:52:16,58
But...l'm sure you've
heard all this before.


971
0:52:16,58 --> 0:52:19,383
Well, yeah,
but l asked you, right?


972
0:52:19,383 --> 0:52:21,118
l'm interested
in what you're doing.


973
0:52:21,118 --> 0:52:24,54
You're...smart.


974
0:52:24,54 --> 0:52:26,39
So you're writing a screenplay?


975
0:52:26,39 --> 0:52:27,257
Yeah...


976
0:52:27,257 --> 0:52:29,226
Maybe when you get a minute,
you could take a look,


977
0:52:29,226 --> 0:52:30,761
give us some notes?


978
0:52:30,761 --> 0:52:32,596
Sure, sure.


979
0:52:32,596 --> 0:52:34,832
What am l here for?


980
0:52:34,832 --> 0:52:40,871
When you're finished,
drop off a copy for me.


981
0:52:40,871 --> 0:52:51,348
Well...


982
0:52:51,348 --> 0:52:53,517
l'm impressed.


983
0:52:53,517 --> 0:52:57,54
You're really
on top of your shit.


984
0:52:57,54 --> 0:52:58,622
Well, l'm a fast learner.


985
0:52:58,622 --> 0:52:59,523
Trust me -


986
0:52:59,523 --> 0:53:1,325
When l put my mind
to something...


987
0:53:1,325 --> 0:53:3,193
l usually get what l want.


988
0:53:3,193 --> 0:53:9,199
You know...l think that
you will have no trouble


989
0:53:9,199 --> 0:53:12,35
working your way up
in this business.


990
0:53:12,35 --> 0:53:16,406
ln fact, l might be able
to help you.


991
0:53:16,406 --> 0:53:21,245
Maybe we can help each other,
if you know what l mean.


992
0:53:21,245 --> 0:53:26,183
l think l do.


993
0:53:26,183 --> 0:53:30,2
ls that what you want, Michael?


994
0:53:30,2 --> 0:53:35,359
Actually, yes.
That is what l want.


995
0:53:35,359 --> 0:53:38,295
Well, l gotta warn you.


996
0:53:38,295 --> 0:53:45,68
l'm a real...naughty girl.


997
0:53:45,68 --> 0:53:46,937
Yeah...


998
0:53:46,937 --> 0:53:49,84
l like naughty girls.


999
0:53:49,84 --> 0:53:53,777
l bet you do.


1000
0:53:53,777 --> 0:53:55,479
So...


1001
0:53:55,479 --> 0:53:57,681
Have you ever been tied up?


1002
0:53:57,681 --> 0:54:2,953
No, but l've tied
a bunch of girls up.


1003
0:54:2,953 --> 0:54:5,923
l love being in control.
lt makes me hot.


1004
0:54:5,923 --> 0:54:7,424
Yeah?


1005
0:54:7,424 --> 0:54:13,23
Whatever turns you on, sweetie.


1006
0:54:13,23 --> 0:54:17,534
This is getting me
so fucking excited.


1007
0:54:17,534 --> 0:54:18,635
Yeah?


1008
0:54:18,635 --> 0:54:30,213
Are your panties getting wet?


1009
0:54:30,213 --> 0:54:31,515
Fuck!


1010
0:54:31,515 --> 0:54:35,319
You are good.


1011
0:54:35,319 --> 0:54:38,755
l really can't
move here, sweetie.


1012
0:54:38,755 --> 0:54:40,257
Good.


1013
0:54:40,257 --> 0:54:44,861
l want you completely helpless.


1014
0:54:44,861 --> 0:54:46,463
l wanna fuck
the shit out of you.


1015
0:54:46,463 --> 0:54:50,901
And l want you
to shut the fuck up.


1016
0:54:50,901 --> 0:54:54,771
l have a special surprise
for you.


1017
0:54:54,771 --> 0:55:0,243
l want you to feel
as hot as l do.


1018
0:55:0,243 --> 0:55:2,245
Do you want to fuck me, Michael?


1019
0:55:2,245 --> 0:55:3,947
Uh huh...


1020
0:55:3,947 --> 0:55:6,149
You wish.


1021
0:55:6,149 --> 0:55:7,884
You see...


1022
0:55:7,884 --> 0:55:10,721
You've been a bad boy.


1023
0:55:10,721 --> 0:55:14,424
And bad boys have to
be punished, Michael.


1024
0:55:14,424 --> 0:55:18,629
And l want you to know...


1025
0:55:18,629 --> 0:55:21,465
what you have coming to you.


1026
0:55:21,465 --> 0:55:23,4
First l'm gonna start
with your balls,


1027
0:55:23,4 --> 0:55:26,937
and l'm gonna
tie 'em up real tight.


1028
0:55:26,937 --> 0:55:28,905
And then l'm gonna
whip your ass


1029
0:55:28,905 --> 0:55:32,442
until you're crying
like a little bitch!


1030
0:55:32,442 --> 0:55:34,878
Then l'm gonna
spit in your face,


1031
0:55:34,878 --> 0:55:39,182
and pee right in your mouth.


1032
0:55:39,182 --> 0:55:41,51
That's right, Michael.


1033
0:55:41,51 --> 0:55:43,987
l'm gonna make you drink me.


1034
0:55:43,987 --> 0:55:45,622
l'm gonna show you


1035
0:55:45,622 --> 0:55:57,67
what a real bad girl
does to a bad boy!


1036
0:55:57,67 --> 0:56:9,98
l don't think
you're ready for this.


1037
0:56:9,98 --> 0:56:12,816
Hey, Michael, Miley said--


1038
0:56:12,816 --> 0:56:18,121
What the fuck are you doin'?


1039
0:56:18,121 --> 0:56:24,761
Can we get some scissors
for him in here, please?


1040
0:56:24,761 --> 0:56:27,364
Fuck!


1041
0:56:27,364 --> 0:56:28,965
Tell that fuckin', crazy bitch


1042
0:56:28,965 --> 0:56:36,106
that she is never allowed
on my set again!


1043
0:56:36,106 --> 0:56:38,575
Come on, sleepy head,
Get up!


1044
0:56:38,575 --> 0:56:40,11
Stop.


1045
0:56:40,11 --> 0:56:42,746
l'm sleeping
and l have a hangover.


1046
0:56:42,746 --> 0:56:43,547
See?


1047
0:56:43,547 --> 0:56:45,515
You were totally
the designated drunk last night.


1048
0:56:45,515 --> 0:56:47,451
l told you
to slow your ass down.


1049
0:56:47,451 --> 0:56:52,689
Wake up.
You gotta get up for work.


1050
0:56:52,689 --> 0:56:54,524
l got downsized.


1051
0:56:54,524 --> 0:56:56,593
We can cuddle all day.


1052
0:56:56,593 --> 0:56:58,95
Downsized?


1053
0:56:58,95 --> 0:57:1,865
How does an intern
get downsized?


1054
0:57:1,865 --> 0:57:3,6
What happened?


1055
0:57:3,6 --> 0:57:5,769
All right...


1056
0:57:5,769 --> 0:57:7,27
l got fired.


1057
0:57:7,27 --> 0:57:9,473
Fired?


1058
0:57:9,473 --> 0:57:11,541
For what?


1059
0:57:11,541 --> 0:57:14,511
What did you do?


1060
0:57:14,511 --> 0:57:15,912
What did l do?


1061
0:57:15,912 --> 0:57:24,421
Why do you immediately
think it was my fault?


1062
0:57:24,421 --> 0:57:26,22
Look...
lt's complicated, OK?


1063
0:57:26,22 --> 0:57:28,425
Me and the director, who is
a complete fucking asshole,


1064
0:57:28,425 --> 0:57:29,96
had a big misunderstanding.


1065
0:57:29,96 --> 0:57:32,462
l'm not surprised...


1066
0:57:32,462 --> 0:57:34,397
You stomp around like you're
the Queen of the City


1067
0:57:34,397 --> 0:57:40,103
and whatever you say goes
and that's that!


1068
0:57:40,103 --> 0:57:41,671
ls that how you see me?


1069
0:57:41,671 --> 0:57:43,64
Yeah...


1070
0:57:43,64 --> 0:57:45,909
Well, sometimes.


1071
0:57:45,909 --> 0:57:49,79
lt's just your energy.


1072
0:57:49,79 --> 0:57:50,747
Jazzy, you're not
makin' any sense.


1073
0:57:50,747 --> 0:57:56,486
l thought this was gonna work
when you got that new job.


1074
0:57:56,486 --> 0:57:57,754
Obviously it's not.


1075
0:57:57,754 --> 0:58:0,323
You'll probably just go back and
do that same shit again, right?


1076
0:58:0,323 --> 0:58:2,759
But l never stopped.


1077
0:58:2,759 --> 0:58:5,562
What l do has no reflection
on how l feel about you.


1078
0:58:5,562 --> 0:58:7,898
l have to share you with all
these perverts and freaks


1079
0:58:7,898 --> 0:58:10,167
looking at you,
droolin' all over you.


1080
0:58:10,167 --> 0:58:13,36
lt's bad enough the shit
we gotta go through day to day


1081
0:58:13,36 --> 0:58:17,307
as lesbians in this city,
and you invite that shit.


1082
0:58:17,307 --> 0:58:21,44
You don't have to
share me with anybody!


1083
0:58:21,44 --> 0:58:23,98
And the crazy thing is
you like that shit!


1084
0:58:23,98 --> 0:58:26,583
l see how much you love it.


1085
0:58:26,583 --> 0:58:30,353
l see how much your eyes
light up when you talk about it.


1086
0:58:30,353 --> 0:58:32,222
You try and find a girl
who's gonna love you


1087
0:58:32,222 --> 0:58:34,124
and deal with this shit.


1088
0:58:34,124 --> 0:58:38,695
l'm sorry...
lt's givin' me nightmares.


1089
0:58:38,695 --> 0:58:40,997
What do you want me to do?


1090
0:58:40,997 --> 0:58:43,2
lt doesn't even matter.


1091
0:58:43,2 --> 0:58:45,669
lt's who you are...


1092
0:58:45,669 --> 0:58:47,671
lt's what you are.


1093
0:58:47,671 --> 0:58:50,774
Sorry, l'm scared of all
this dominatrix shit.


1094
0:58:50,774 --> 0:58:56,79
l don't wanna
get caught up in it.


1095
0:58:56,79 --> 0:59:20,237
l don't know what to say.


1096
0:59:20,237 --> 0:59:22,405
- Hey.
- Hey.


1097
0:59:22,405 --> 0:59:24,674
Hey!


1098
0:59:24,674 --> 0:59:25,909
Hey what?


1099
0:59:25,909 --> 0:59:27,51
Are you all right?


1100
0:59:27,51 --> 0:59:29,112
Yeah, l'm fine.


1101
0:59:29,112 --> 0:59:30,714
OK...


1102
0:59:30,714 --> 0:59:31,982
Well, um...


1103
0:59:31,982 --> 0:59:33,183
l was on the subway


1104
0:59:33,183 --> 0:59:34,784
and there was this
really hot guy--


1105
0:59:34,784 --> 0:59:37,621
Jazz and l
got into another fight.


1106
0:59:37,621 --> 0:59:38,822
l'm sorry.


1107
0:59:38,822 --> 0:59:40,523
What was that about
the subway guy?


1108
0:59:40,523 --> 0:59:42,25
Oh, nothing.


1109
0:59:42,25 --> 0:59:43,26
Your girlfriend troubles


1110
0:59:43,26 --> 0:59:45,862
trump my almost getting
picked up by a blue-eyed hottie.


1111
0:59:45,862 --> 0:59:48,131
lt just keeps happening.
lt's crazy.


1112
0:59:48,131 --> 0:59:50,333
Well, are you doing
anything different?


1113
0:59:50,333 --> 0:59:52,602
What do you mean?


1114
0:59:52,602 --> 0:59:57,7
Well, some people might think
that the definition of crazy


1115
0:59:57,7 --> 0:59:59,376
is doing the same thing
over and over again


1116
0:59:59,376 --> 1:0:2,846
and expecting different results.


1117
1:0:2,846 --> 1:0:4,447
What?


1118
1:0:4,447 --> 1:0:6,416
Didn't Mommy say that?


1119
1:0:6,416 --> 1:0:9,386
Oh, shit.


1120
1:0:9,386 --> 1:0:12,589
Oh, fuck, l'm quoting Mommy?


1121
1:0:12,589 --> 1:0:15,25
Am l becoming Mommy?


1122
1:0:15,25 --> 1:0:16,559
Yeah...


1123
1:0:16,559 --> 1:0:20,697
The transformation has begun.


1124
1:0:20,697 --> 1:0:24,267
My life is over.


1125
1:0:24,267 --> 1:0:53,33
Oh, God...


1126
1:0:53,33 --> 1:1:15,685
Holy shit.


1127
1:1:15,685 --> 1:1:18,388
Hey, sis.


1128
1:1:18,388 --> 1:1:21,558
Are you all right?


1129
1:1:21,558 --> 1:1:25,328
Yeah, l'm fine.


1130
1:1:25,328 --> 1:1:28,365
Mommy says you're depressed.


1131
1:1:28,365 --> 1:1:29,966
Ma!


1132
1:1:29,966 --> 1:1:32,168
Why are you telling
everyone l'm depressed?


1133
1:1:32,168 --> 1:1:34,27
Rebecca's not everyone.


1134
1:1:34,27 --> 1:1:36,139
And you're all emotional.


1135
1:1:36,139 --> 1:1:37,64
Emotional?


1136
1:1:37,64 --> 1:1:39,743
Me and my girlfriend
just broke up.


1137
1:1:39,743 --> 1:1:41,411
Of course l'm emotional.


1138
1:1:41,411 --> 1:1:44,214
Don't you think you're
being overly sensitive?


1139
1:1:44,214 --> 1:1:46,983
No, l think you're being
a little insensitive.


1140
1:1:46,983 --> 1:1:49,786
lt's just because
we care about you.


1141
1:1:49,786 --> 1:1:53,456
The right person
will love you for who you are.


1142
1:1:53,456 --> 1:1:57,327
l know.


1143
1:1:57,327 --> 1:1:59,929
She wasn't right for you anyway.


1144
1:1:59,929 --> 1:2:1,331
How do you know?


1145
1:2:1,331 --> 1:2:4,0
She was just a little
too normal for you.


1146
1:2:4,0 --> 1:2:8,571
l liked her for me.


1147
1:2:8,571 --> 1:2:11,274
Natalie, your hair
looks really pretty.


1148
1:2:11,274 --> 1:2:14,244
Why don't you
leave it down today?


1149
1:2:14,244 --> 1:2:15,812
Enough with the hair thing, Ma.


1150
1:2:15,812 --> 1:2:17,313
ls there some fetish
we should know about?


1151
1:2:17,313 --> 1:2:22,986
What's your fascination
with our hair?


1152
1:2:22,986 --> 1:2:27,19
[all laughing]


1153
1:2:27,19 --> 1:2:29,459
No, no, no.


1154
1:2:29,459 --> 1:2:34,497
l just want you guys
to be healthy and happy.


1155
1:2:34,497 --> 1:2:36,499

1156
1:2:36,499 --> 1:2:38,101
l'm just tryin' to find myself.


1157
1:2:38,101 --> 1:2:39,402
You'll find yourself.


1158
1:2:39,402 --> 1:2:41,504
The important thing
to use your passion


1159
1:2:41,504 --> 1:2:59,255
to define your place
in this world.


1160
1:2:59,255 --> 1:3:5,261
[knocking at door]


1161
1:3:5,261 --> 1:3:7,3
- Hey, Noah.
- Are you all right?


1162
1:3:7,3 --> 1:3:8,631
How did you know?


1163
1:3:8,631 --> 1:3:10,533
Melanie told me.


1164
1:3:10,533 --> 1:3:13,269
lt's just stupid.
Everything's so stupid.


1165
1:3:13,269 --> 1:3:14,404

1166
1:3:14,404 --> 1:3:16,706
lt's gonna be all right.
l got you.


1167
1:3:16,706 --> 1:3:17,707
You're gonna bounce back.


1168
1:3:17,707 --> 1:3:19,109
You're the motherfuckin'
queen bee,


1169
1:3:19,109 --> 1:3:21,678
the bad girl extraordinaire!
C'mon now.


1170
1:3:21,678 --> 1:3:23,213
Bad girl...


1171
1:3:23,213 --> 1:3:26,449
The job, the relationship,
the director.


1172
1:3:26,449 --> 1:3:27,917
Bad, bad, bad.


1173
1:3:27,917 --> 1:3:29,85
You're right...


1174
1:3:29,85 --> 1:3:31,87
l am the
bad girl extraordinaire,


1175
1:3:31,87 --> 1:3:32,255
but not in a good way.


1176
1:3:32,255 --> 1:3:33,857
Come here...


1177
1:3:33,857 --> 1:3:35,492
ln times like these,


1178
1:3:35,492 --> 1:3:38,194
there's only two things
you can turn to -


1179
1:3:38,194 --> 1:3:39,796
Friends...


1180
1:3:39,796 --> 1:3:43,32
And of course...
da ganja, mon.


1181
1:3:43,32 --> 1:3:46,102
Come on.


1182
1:3:46,102 --> 1:3:48,538
l'm so upset right now
l don't even wanna smoke.


1183
1:3:48,538 --> 1:3:50,64
Come on, girl!
Get the fuck outta here!


1184
1:3:50,64 --> 1:3:51,841
Last week we were like


1185
1:3:51,841 --> 1:3:53,42
Cheech and Chong
in this muthafucker!


1186
1:3:53,42 --> 1:3:54,21
l can't even focus.


1187
1:3:54,21 --> 1:3:55,879
You got a bad case
of girl drama,


1188
1:3:55,879 --> 1:3:57,58
which means you're
gonna forget about


1189
1:3:57,58 --> 1:4:5,388
this shit in a week.
Now come on.


1190
1:4:5,388 --> 1:4:9,25
All right.


1191
1:4:9,25 --> 1:4:20,136
Here we go...


1192
1:4:20,136 --> 1:4:22,272
l gave him a copy of the script.


1193
1:4:22,272 --> 1:4:25,708
You did?


1194
1:4:25,708 --> 1:4:30,313
Can't have our shit
out there all unfinished...


1195
1:4:30,313 --> 1:4:31,981
l'll get our shit back.


1196
1:4:31,981 --> 1:4:34,751
Even if l have to beat his ass,
l will get our shit back.


1197
1:4:34,751 --> 1:4:37,487
You gonna get all
gansta on his ass?


1198
1:4:37,487 --> 1:4:39,88
l will haunt that motherfucker


1199
1:4:39,88 --> 1:4:41,724
like the soul
of a child molester.


1200
1:4:41,724 --> 1:4:43,793
[phone rings]


1201
1:4:43,793 --> 1:4:46,196
That's probably my grandmother.


1202
1:4:46,196 --> 1:4:47,363
Natalie!


1203
1:4:47,363 --> 1:4:49,532
lt's me, Michael.


1204
1:4:49,532 --> 1:4:51,167
Hey...


1205
1:4:51,167 --> 1:4:53,536
Look...l, uh...


1206
1:4:53,536 --> 1:4:56,773

1207
1:4:56,773 --> 1:4:58,7
Holy shit!


1208
1:4:58,7 --> 1:4:59,442
Michael as in dickhead Michael?


1209
1:4:59,442 --> 1:5:2,412
[phone rings]


1210
1:5:2,412 --> 1:5:4,714
Natalie, it's me again.


1211
1:5:4,714 --> 1:5:6,149

1212
1:5:6,149 --> 1:5:7,784

Damn, you got him

1:5:15,124 --> 1:5:16,893
Tell me what happened.


1216
1:5:16,893 --> 1:5:20,63
Well, your boy was
gettin' all nasty with me,


1217
1:5:20,63 --> 1:5:21,831
and l had to show him
what nasty really is.


1218
1:5:21,831 --> 1:5:23,66
What the fuck you do?


1219
1:5:23,66 --> 1:5:24,968
[phone rings]


1220
1:5:24,968 --> 1:5:27,537
What the fuck?


1221
1:5:27,537 --> 1:5:29,339
Are you there?


1222
1:5:29,339 --> 1:5:32,8
Please, l'm begging you...


1223
1:5:32,8 --> 1:5:35,11
Pick up the phone, please--


1224
1:5:35,11 --> 1:5:37,113
Damn, ma.


1225
1:5:37,113 --> 1:5:41,551
How the fuck
did he get my number?


1226
1:5:41,551 --> 1:5:44,554
Let's get to work.


1227
1:5:44,554 --> 1:6:3,72
Please, please, please.


1228
1:6:3,72 --> 1:6:5,642
- Hey.

1229
1:6:5,642 --> 1:6:8,244
l miss you guys so much.


1230
1:6:8,244 --> 1:6:10,246
l don't even remember
the last time we all hung out


1231
1:6:10,246 --> 1:6:11,614
since l left the dungeon.


1232
1:6:11,614 --> 1:6:13,49
- Do you?
- Nope.


1233
1:6:13,49 --> 1:6:17,787
Since y'all are my best
friends, and my sisters,


1234
1:6:17,787 --> 1:6:21,557
l want you to be
the first to know...


1235
1:6:21,557 --> 1:6:23,293
l'm pregnant!


1236
1:6:23,293 --> 1:6:24,761
What?


1237
1:6:24,761 --> 1:6:27,63
- Are you serious
- Really?


1238
1:6:27,63 --> 1:6:29,132
Wow! You really did it?


1239
1:6:29,132 --> 1:6:32,602
That is so cool.

1240
1:6:32,602 --> 1:6:33,87
Oh, my God!


1241

You are going to be
a great mother.


1242
1:6:36,839 --> 1:6:37,774
How do you feel?


1243
1:6:37,774 --> 1:6:40,643
Like l went to rehab...
For real!


1244
1:6:40,643 --> 1:6:43,546
l never thought l'd hear that
out of your mouth.


1245
1:6:43,546 --> 1:6:45,315
Well, there comes
a point in life


1246
1:6:45,315 --> 1:6:50,32
where you must grow up
and leave certain things behind.


1247
1:6:50,32 --> 1:6:52,288
l'm happy for you.


1248
1:6:52,288 --> 1:6:53,723
What's up with you, Mel?


1249
1:6:53,723 --> 1:6:55,591
l'm still doing my thing.


1250
1:6:55,591 --> 1:6:57,393
l have a ton of regular clients.


1251
1:6:57,393 --> 1:7:0,43
And l'm dating this guy,
and guess what?


1252
1:7:0,43 --> 1:7:2,598
He loves that l'm a domme.


1253
1:7:2,598 --> 1:7:5,1
l mean, l think he's really
kind of into it.


1254
1:7:5,1 --> 1:7:8,504
l've been having
an amazing time.


1255
1:7:8,504 --> 1:7:10,206
What about you, Nat?


1256
1:7:10,206 --> 1:7:12,41
l kept a couple of regulars.


1257
1:7:12,41 --> 1:7:14,243
But me and Noah are busy
with our script.


1258
1:7:14,243 --> 1:7:16,913
Oh, and how is that going?


1259
1:7:16,913 --> 1:7:20,983
The film business is rough,
but l love it!


1260
1:7:20,983 --> 1:7:23,553
Do you all wanna
get some ices?


1261
1:7:23,553 --> 1:7:26,589
- Yes!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!


1262
1:7:26,589 --> 1:7:39,1

1263
1:7:39,1 --> 1:7:41,7
What are you doing
with your script?


1264
1:7:41,7 --> 1:7:42,772
l'm not sure what
the next step is,


1265
1:7:42,772 --> 1:7:44,34
except getting it produced.


1266
1:7:44,34 --> 1:7:46,442
l have to find someone
who believes in it...


1267
1:7:46,442 --> 1:7:48,211
and believes in me.


1268
1:7:48,211 --> 1:7:50,79
Well, l believe in you.


1269
1:7:50,79 --> 1:7:52,448

and l want to help you.


1270
1:7:52,448 --> 1:7:55,218
That's sweet.


1271
1:7:55,218 --> 1:7:56,819
Thank you.


1272
1:7:56,819 --> 1:7:58,654
No, l'm serious.

1:7:58,654 --> 1:8:1,758
l'm a good businessman
and l know people.


1274
1:8:1,758 --> 1:8:4,193
But l don't know
anything about film.


1275
1:8:4,193 --> 1:8:6,629
lf you can find
a hotshot director...


1276
1:8:6,629 --> 1:8:8,364
l'll back it.


1277
1:8:8,364 --> 1:8:11,67
Just leave all the finances
up to me.


1278
1:8:11,67 --> 1:8:12,502
Really?


1279
1:8:12,502 --> 1:8:14,604
You'd do that for me?


1280
1:8:14,604 --> 1:8:22,745
l'd do anything
for you, Mistress.


1281
1:8:22,745 --> 1:8:24,28
Psst...


1282
1:8:24,28 --> 1:8:45,34
My real name's Natalie.


1283
1:8:45,34 --> 1:8:46,369
Natalie!


1284
1:8:46,369 --> 1:8:48,704
Hey, um...
We need to talk.


1285
1:8:48,704 --> 1:8:50,106
Michael, what the fuck
are you doing here?


1286
1:8:50,106 --> 1:8:51,307
Are you stalking me?


1287
1:8:51,307 --> 1:8:53,91
No! l-l just...


1288
1:8:53,91 --> 1:8:57,88
l needed to see you.


1289
1:8:57,88 --> 1:8:59,849
What do you want, Michael?


1290
1:8:59,849 --> 1:9:1,417
You did something to me.


1291
1:9:1,417 --> 1:9:5,455
You unlocked something in me
l didn't know existed.


1292
1:9:5,455 --> 1:9:7,623
Something l can't control.


1293
1:9:7,623 --> 1:9:9,992
You know me...
l gotta control everything.


1294
1:9:9,992 --> 1:9:12,728
Yeah, you're an asshole.


1295
1:9:12,728 --> 1:9:14,697
lf we could just...


1296
1:9:14,697 --> 1:9:17,7
lf l could just
spend some time with you...


1297
1:9:17,7 --> 1:9:21,504
Maybe we can work something out?


1298
1:9:21,504 --> 1:9:22,772
Sure...


1299
1:9:22,772 --> 1:9:24,44
We can work somethin' out.


1300
1:9:24,44 --> 1:9:33,382
Step into my office.


1301
1:9:33,382 --> 1:9:34,817
Somebody will be here shortly


1302
1:9:34,817 --> 1:10:38,748
to prepare you
for your Mistress.


1303
1:10:38,748 --> 1:10:44,82
Hi.


1304
1:10:44,82 --> 1:10:46,489
l've been thinking about
what you said about me


1305
1:10:46,489 --> 1:10:48,9
not being ready...


1306
1:10:48,9 --> 1:10:49,992
And you were right.


1307
1:10:49,992 --> 1:10:53,296
But l'm ready now.


1308
1:10:53,296 --> 1:10:56,766
Oh, really?


1309
1:10:56,766 --> 1:10:58,367
Ready for what?


1310
1:10:58,367 --> 1:11:3,873
Ready to do whatever l...


1311
1:11:3,873 --> 1:11:8,11
Ready to do whatever
you want me to do.


1312
1:11:8,11 --> 1:11:9,912
OK.


1313
1:11:9,912 --> 1:11:46,849
The first thing
l want you to do...


1314
1:11:46,849 --> 1:11:50,553
My Normal, by Natalie Lawna
and Noah Cohen.


1315
1:11:50,553 --> 1:11:51,921
Scene One.


1316
1:11:51,921 --> 1:11:54,223
James, a middle-aged man
dressed in a suit


1317
1:11:54,223 --> 1:11:56,459
sits behind a desk
shuffling papers.


1318
1:11:56,459 --> 1:12:1,897
He shakes his head
and mutters...


1319
1:12:1,897 --> 1:12:5,67
We have a very
big problem here, girls.


1320
1:12:5,67 --> 1:12:9,171
Girls, we have
a very big problem.


1321
1:12:9,171 --> 1:12:12,775
We have a very
big problem, girls.


1322
1:12:12,775 --> 1:12:16,846
Girls, we have
a very big problem.


1323
1:12:16,846 --> 1:12:19,849
How big is our problem?


1324
1:12:19,849 --> 1:13:16,505
[dialogue continues
and fades]


1325
1:13:16,505 --> 1:13:45,401
Ashtray.


1326
1:13:45,401 --> 1:13:46,902

1327
1:13:46,902 --> 1:13:48,437
Marker.


1328
1:13:48,437 --> 1:13:54,677
You don't even know!


1329
1:13:54,677 --> 1:14:15,631
Hi.


1330
1:14:15,631 --> 1:14:18,434
Tell us a little bit
about your character.


1331
1:14:18,434 --> 1:14:23,639
My character is,
l guess, the gimp...


1332
1:14:23,639 --> 1:14:26,408
the ashtray.


1333
1:14:26,408 --> 1:14:29,44
He's the bitch of
the main character


1334
1:14:29,44 --> 1:14:51,4
and he's only there as
a receptacle for her garbage.


1335
1:14:51,4 --> 1:14:54,236
Can you tell me your name
and what you do?


1336
1:14:54,236 --> 1:14:56,38
My name is Storm,


1337
1:14:56,38 --> 1:16:56,38
and l'm a physical therapist.
