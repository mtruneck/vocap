###9 Hi lovely people of Food Tube. I am in Gozo, beautiful Gozo. It's an island next to Malta.
###16 Yes! I'm gonna celebrate this beautiful island, I'm gonna make my own homemade pizza - classic
###24 margherita. So simple, so easy. The world love Pizza. Why you should go buy? Make your own.
###33 It's cheap and easy and it is delicious! Let me show you how. A bowl, 500g of strong
###41 flour, 1 teaspoon of salt, sachet of 7g of dried yeast, then you have here 325ml of warm
###55 water. Straight in. Mix it Now can you see the salt
###63 on here? I'm gonna mix it, the salt with the flour. The yeast goes inside then you mix
###73 it. What is it about making pizza? It's fantastico!
###77 Turn it down, move the spoon, then start to mix it.
###86 Fantastico! This stage I need a little bit of flour, just
###93 a little bit. Put it on top. This is the way you clean your hands. I love making pizza!
###100 You gather all together and that. With the palm of your hand in one side, you're
###106 holding for the other one, you pull it and you fold it, you pull it and you fold it and
###111 you carry on doing that, ok? Then you get the other side, pull it and you
###118 fold it. Now the dough is ready! Get the flour, just
###124 roll it a little bit. Get a knife, you do one, two, three and four. It's about, 150g.
###139 Roll it, roll it. Now you've got four beautiful portions of dough. Now I'm gonna proof the
###149 dough. First, we need a little bit of semolina. If you don't have semolina use breadcrumbs,
###157 it works fantastic. This is what I used to do. I'm gonna proof it. What is proofing?
###162 Yeast is alive. Soon as it touch water, start to move it. Soon as it touch the flour, starts
###169 to feed. They create air. Oxygen goes bubbling like oooooh. And it goes boobooboobooboo,
###179 double the size. Because they are happy! But then, (sigh) they rested. They become very
###186 elastic, you can stretch them nice, I don't mind.
###191 Put a little flour on top, put a damp cloth on and let it proof for at least two hours.
###203 Here they are! (sings) Bam bam bam bam! Flour. Look at that!
###209 They double the size. Press it and turn them around again, pick him up. Look at that!
###219 Ok. Now there is a little hole here. Don't try to stick it, try to take it from the sides
###227 of the pizza, put them on the middle. Then with your finger, just press it. This is really
###234 fantastic. Stop! We get nice tomato, or Passata will do.
###241 Or this particular one I've flavoured with the garlic, it's easy.
###244 Stop from the middle, you do not need too much tomato. Drizzle with some little olive
###254 oil. It help to flavour the pizza. Little bit of salt. When you reach the stage
###262 to make the classic margherita, you need parmesan cheese. This will be so delicious. Nice mozzarella.
###273 For each pizza you need about 50g of mozzarella. Just break with your hands, it's so good.
###283 Basil, break it. Yes, with a nice drizzle of olive oil again. Pallet, here you are.
###291 Little semolina on the pallet. Don't be afraid, readjust it. Now a miracle will happen. Yes!
###306 This is very rustic!
###310 Oh yes! This is what I call a pizza. Look at that! The perfect
###318 pizza! The tomato, the basil on top, the cheese, the Gozo olive oil. Gozo I love you. You can
###326 put salami, you can put preserved vegetable, make your own, it's ever so easy. If you want
