1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:25,296



2
0:0:25,296 --> 0:0:27,28
INTERVIEWER: Damn.


3
0:0:27,28 --> 0:0:30,26
Lucky.


4
0:0:30,26 --> 0:0:31,953
Wait, tell me about
this place.


5
0:0:31,953 --> 0:0:35,811



6
0:0:35,811 --> 0:0:38,516
DYLAN RIEDER: I don't want to
reveal too much information.


7
0:0:38,516 --> 0:0:41,436
INTERVIEWER: You've gotta
tell me something, Bro.


8
0:0:41,436 --> 0:0:43,965
DYLAN RIEDER: It's just
a private facility me


9
0:0:43,965 --> 0:0:45,474
and some guys got.


10
0:0:45,474 --> 0:0:48,85



11
0:0:48,85 --> 0:0:50,6
I designed the [INAUDIBLE]
corner,


12
0:0:50,6 --> 0:0:51,31
that was my main piece.


13
0:0:51,31 --> 0:1:11,38



14
0:1:11,38 --> 0:1:12,316
INTERVIEWER: And we're
not supposed to


15
0:1:12,316 --> 0:1:12,954
be filming in here?


16
0:1:12,954 --> 0:1:14,567
DYLAN RIEDER: I don't think
we're supposed to


17
0:1:14,567 --> 0:1:15,374
be filming in here.


18
0:1:15,374 --> 0:1:21,62
Whatever, I pay rent, so.


19
0:1:21,62 --> 0:1:23,99
I might get yelled
at for this.


20
0:1:23,99 --> 0:1:28,23
But, whatever, my life.


21
0:1:28,23 --> 0:1:29,51
PATRICK O'DELL: What's up?


22
0:1:29,51 --> 0:1:31,27
Welcome back to Epicly
Later'd.


23
0:1:31,27 --> 0:1:34,37
This episode's about Dylan
Rieder whose hands down one of


24
0:1:34,37 --> 0:1:37,9
the best pros out right now.


25
0:1:37,9 --> 0:1:42,16
He just came out with a part
on gravis, just him as the


26
0:1:42,16 --> 0:1:44,43
whole video, and it's amazing.


27
0:1:44,43 --> 0:1:46,51
I guess the only reason he made
it is because he wasn't


28
0:1:46,51 --> 0:1:49,37
really that satisfied with the
Alien Workshop part that came


29
0:1:49,37 --> 0:1:51,5
out a year ago.


30
0:1:51,5 --> 0:1:54,48
Dylan's amazing, I hope
you enjoy the episode.


31
0:1:54,48 --> 0:1:57,0



32
0:1:57,0 --> 0:2:1,71
DYLAN RIEDER: I grew up in
Westminster, a little north of


33
0:2:1,71 --> 0:2:8,22
Huntington Beach, kind of like
Korean, Mexican town, a lot of


34
0:2:8,22 --> 0:2:10,47
pool halls, a lot of pho.


35
0:2:10,47 --> 0:2:12,48
I don't think anybody's really
from Westminster, none of whom


36
0:2:12,48 --> 0:2:14,74
that skates.


37
0:2:14,74 --> 0:2:17,65
Just Huntington Beach, Dells
from Huntington Beach.


38
0:2:17,65 --> 0:2:19,3
I think, Templeton's
from Huntington.


39
0:2:19,3 --> 0:2:22,2
Like you ever been to that murdy
park down there, it's


40
0:2:22,2 --> 0:2:24,6
like a little ashtray park, I
think Templeton designed it.


41
0:2:24,6 --> 0:2:26,616
INTERVIEWER: Yeah,
the famous one.


42
0:2:26,616 --> 0:2:28,44
DYLAN RIEDER: No, I think in
Huntington Park's the famous


43
0:2:28,44 --> 0:2:29,57
one over by the high school.


44
0:2:29,57 --> 0:2:31,67
Then there's another one before
that, that was smaller,


45
0:2:31,67 --> 0:2:32,6
before Huntington Park.


46
0:2:32,6 --> 0:2:34,48
But we used to go there,
because we were too


47
0:2:34,48 --> 0:2:35,33
intimidated to go to Huntington
Park, because


48
0:2:35,33 --> 0:2:40,71
that's where Andrew went and all
those those Warren Avenue


49
0:2:40,71 --> 0:2:42,1
crew dudes, at the time.


50
0:2:42,1 --> 0:2:45,93
I was like 11, maybe 10.


51
0:2:45,93 --> 0:2:48,25
I remember seeing like Andrew
at Huntington Park for the


52
0:2:48,25 --> 0:2:52,51
first time, I was pretty
star struck.


53
0:2:52,51 --> 0:2:54,5
Saw Penny there a couple times
when I was little.


54
0:2:54,5 --> 0:2:57,4
That old Penny footage
there is awesome.


55
0:2:57,4 --> 0:2:59,43
He rips that place.


56
0:2:59,43 --> 0:3:2,53
It's not there anymore, they
took it out, demolished it to


57
0:3:2,53 --> 0:3:5,262
extend the football fucking
field, which is stupid.


58
0:3:5,262 --> 0:3:6,555
INTERVIEWER: So how
old are you now?


59
0:3:6,555 --> 0:3:8,1
DYLAN RIEDER: 21.


60
0:3:8,1 --> 0:3:11,582
INTERVIEWER: OK, that seems like
you'd be real young when


61
0:3:11,582 --> 0:3:12,805
that was going on.


62
0:3:12,805 --> 0:3:14,92
DYLAN RIEDER: Yeah,
I was super young.


63
0:3:14,92 --> 0:3:16,42
Such a little shit head.


64
0:3:16,42 --> 0:3:19,45
MARK OBLOW: I first met Dylan,
I was doing a photo shoot for


65
0:3:19,45 --> 0:3:22,66
Quicksilver for their
youth campaign.


66
0:3:22,66 --> 0:3:24,95
I would shoot whoever
they would bring.


67
0:3:24,95 --> 0:3:26,33
They would bring models,
or whatever.


68
0:3:26,33 --> 0:3:29,23
And then at that point Dylan
actually had come in, like


69
0:3:29,23 --> 0:3:31,39
they picked him as a
little boy model.


70
0:3:31,39 --> 0:3:33,543
And he had come in like that
like, and they're like, oh, we


71
0:3:33,543 --> 0:3:36,26
brought a little skater guy,
and I was super anti.


72
0:3:36,26 --> 0:3:39,18
I was like, [PHEW], totally
get away from me.


73
0:3:39,18 --> 0:3:41,94
We shot some photos, and then
they needed action photos.


74
0:3:41,94 --> 0:3:45,46
So then I sent Tim to go shoot
some stuff with Ortiz, because


75
0:3:45,46 --> 0:3:47,94
I was like, I ain't even going
to waste my fucking time.


76
0:3:47,94 --> 0:3:50,61
I talked to Ortiz later, and I
was like, hey, how'd that go?


77
0:3:50,61 --> 0:3:53,32
And Ortiz was like, Dude,
he's pretty gnarly.


78
0:3:53,32 --> 0:3:54,66
And I'm like, what
do you mean?


79
0:3:54,66 --> 0:3:56,66
What was he pretty gnarly?


80
0:3:56,66 --> 0:3:59,45
He's actually like, Smith Grind
this rail and he kick


81
0:3:59,45 --> 0:4:1,13
flipped down these stairs.


82
0:4:1,13 --> 0:4:2,26
And I was just like, what?


83
0:4:2,26 --> 0:4:4,16
Get the fuck out of
here, whatever.


84
0:4:4,16 --> 0:4:7,38
So then, Damn Am comes around,
he basically is like, can I


85
0:4:7,38 --> 0:4:9,4
come enter the Damn Am?


86
0:4:9,4 --> 0:4:10,5
Can I enter under Quicksilver?


87
0:4:10,5 --> 0:4:12,9
And I'm like, yeah go for it,
whatever, it's totally cool.


88
0:4:12,9 --> 0:4:15,22
And then next thing you know,
he won the contest.


89
0:4:15,22 --> 0:4:16,959
And I was just like,
what the fuck?


90
0:4:16,959 --> 0:4:19,73
From that point on, he basically
went on pretty much


91
0:4:19,73 --> 0:4:22,865
every single trip that I
did for Quicksilver.


92
0:4:22,865 --> 0:4:27,54



93
0:4:27,54 --> 0:4:29,44
These are the fucked up ones.


94
0:4:29,44 --> 0:4:32,61
Like this, this was the
first Miami trip.


95
0:4:32,61 --> 0:4:35,58
That was his first
trip with us.


96
0:4:35,58 --> 0:4:40,145
That was with Janoski, and
Donny Barley, and Reece.


97
0:4:40,145 --> 0:4:41,97
But like that was--


98
0:4:41,97 --> 0:4:43,342
INTERVIEWER: He's got braces?


99
0:4:43,342 --> 0:4:44,95
MARK OBLOW: Yeah,
he's got braces.


100
0:4:44,95 --> 0:4:47,23
He was such a little,
like, little guy.


101
0:4:47,23 --> 0:4:49,81



102
0:4:49,81 --> 0:4:53,141
The old team right there.


103
0:4:53,141 --> 0:4:55,4
GREG HUNT: I mean, that's
something I even, like, I


104
0:4:55,4 --> 0:4:57,53
skate with him all the
time and I forget.


105
0:4:57,53 --> 0:5:0,6
Like when he was like 12, he
was going on trips with the


106
0:5:0,6 --> 0:5:5,27
Quicksilver guys, like Reece,
Stefan, and he was just like


107
0:5:5,27 --> 0:5:7,34
the little kid with
men, you know.


108
0:5:7,34 --> 0:5:9,94
And then also with Osiris, I
think he went on like a bunch


109
0:5:9,94 --> 0:5:12,28
of trips with Jerry,
and all those guys.


110
0:5:12,28 --> 0:5:15,35
So he's got like some
pretty deep roots.


111
0:5:15,35 --> 0:5:18,4
Like, once in a while I'll see
these old photos, be like, Oh


112
0:5:18,4 --> 0:5:21,41
yeah, were like, one of
those little kids.


113
0:5:21,41 --> 0:5:23,75
Misled Youth, or whatever,
was his favorite video.


114
0:5:23,75 --> 0:5:26,43
And like, he had like super skin
tight pants, he was like


115
0:5:26,43 --> 0:5:29,37
13 years old, he's like one of
those kids, like lip sliding


116
0:5:29,37 --> 0:5:31,91
15-stair hand rails,
or something.


117
0:5:31,91 --> 0:5:34,17
Going out with his buddies at
night, like lighting stuff up


118
0:5:34,17 --> 0:5:35,95
like a bunch of like
15-year-old kids.


119
0:5:35,95 --> 0:5:39,564
Like trying to skate like most
gigantic hand rail and almost


120
0:5:39,564 --> 0:5:40,814
killing themselves, you know.


121
0:5:40,814 --> 0:5:44,86



122
0:5:44,86 --> 0:5:47,23
MARK OBLOW: Jerry has a portrait
of him somewhere.


123
0:5:47,23 --> 0:5:49,76
And it's just like this portrait
of this baby, it's


124
0:5:49,76 --> 0:5:51,59
like Dylan, it's like
this baby face.


125
0:5:51,59 --> 0:5:55,16
JERRY HSU: I first met Dylan
when I rode for Osiris.


126
0:5:55,16 --> 0:5:57,9
And I think Chris Pastras was
our team manager at the time,


127
0:5:57,9 --> 0:5:59,47
and I don't know where
he found him.


128
0:5:59,47 --> 0:6:2,99
I think he went to like a
contest or something, and just


129
0:6:2,99 --> 0:6:6,53
found this kid, and just brought
him on some trips.


130
0:6:6,53 --> 0:6:8,56
That's how I'd first met him,
I'd never heard of him, or


131
0:6:8,56 --> 0:6:11,21
seen photos of him, or
anything like that.


132
0:6:11,21 --> 0:6:14,4
But I just trust Chris, because
he had good taste.


133
0:6:14,4 --> 0:6:18,44
Me and Louie on tour we would
kind of try to take care of


134
0:6:18,44 --> 0:6:20,19
him and make sure he
didn't get into too


135
0:6:20,19 --> 0:6:22,8
much trouble or anything.


136
0:6:22,8 --> 0:6:23,6
He was so young.


137
0:6:23,6 --> 0:6:24,75
He was really quiet.


138
0:6:24,75 --> 0:6:25,95
He never said anything.


139
0:6:25,95 --> 0:6:29,78
He was just this really quiet
kid, with like braces.


140
0:6:29,78 --> 0:6:31,63
It's funny, like he
was really shy.


141
0:6:31,63 --> 0:6:34,63
Girls always wanted to
talk to him, and


142
0:6:34,63 --> 0:6:35,99
like hug him and stuff.


143
0:6:35,99 --> 0:6:38,55
He was just like this adorable
little kid, and like he was


144
0:6:38,55 --> 0:6:42,31
just so shy, and like he didn't
really-- and it was all


145
0:6:42,31 --> 0:6:44,83
really new to him, just being
sponsored and traveling.


146
0:6:44,83 --> 0:6:46,52
You could tell he was
a mature kid.


147
0:6:46,52 --> 0:6:49,54
He wasn't like just some spaz.


148
0:6:49,54 --> 0:6:52,73
Like normally kids at that age
you can tell that they don't


149
0:6:52,73 --> 0:6:54,2
really know how to skate yet.


150
0:6:54,2 --> 0:6:55,91
I mean, maybe they could do hard
tricks, but they can't


151
0:6:55,91 --> 0:6:56,48
really skate.


152
0:6:56,48 --> 0:7:0,25
But Dylan could skate
everything, and like skate


153
0:7:0,25 --> 0:7:1,21
really well.


154
0:7:1,21 --> 0:7:2,87
Like, we liked him
a lot right away.


155
0:7:2,87 --> 0:7:4,395
We really liked his skating.


156
0:7:4,395 --> 0:7:7,87
DYLAN RIEDER: When Osiris came
out with the Subject to Change


157
0:7:7,87 --> 0:7:11,86
video, I shared a part
with "the Butcher".


158
0:7:11,86 --> 0:7:16,471
I was excited, it was the first
video I was filming for.


159
0:7:16,471 --> 0:7:21,4
I was like 15, 14.


160
0:7:21,4 --> 0:7:23,96
When I was that age all I really
did was like skate


161
0:7:23,96 --> 0:7:25,21
rails and stuff.


162
0:7:25,21 --> 0:7:27,53



163
0:7:27,53 --> 0:7:29,85
GREG HUNT: He kind of got
labeled as like a little rail


164
0:7:29,85 --> 0:7:33,52
kid, because that's all he was
really skating was rails.


165
0:7:33,52 --> 0:7:36,5
Once again, seeing a little
kid in the beginning.


166
0:7:36,5 --> 0:7:38,3
He thinks one way,
and then he gets


167
0:7:38,3 --> 0:7:39,7
influenced by someone else.


168
0:7:39,7 --> 0:7:42,67
He really got influenced with
Tony T and those guys.


169
0:7:42,67 --> 0:7:45,53
And Tony was, I think, a big
influence with him, and so was


170
0:7:45,53 --> 0:7:46,5
Donnie Barley.


171
0:7:46,5 --> 0:7:49,6
And those guys, what kind of
set them apart, was their


172
0:7:49,6 --> 0:7:50,83
being able to skate tranny.


173
0:7:50,83 --> 0:7:55,68
It really hit him, and I think
the way he looked at skating


174
0:7:55,68 --> 0:7:57,18
bowls, and skating tranny.


175
0:7:57,18 --> 0:8:1,22
And, like I actually made him
enter the first contest.


176
0:8:1,22 --> 0:8:2,87
And he did pretty bad.


177
0:8:2,87 --> 0:8:5,39
And then he went back the second
year, and he actually


178
0:8:5,39 --> 0:8:9,57
got 13th place, which is pretty
gnarly for Marseilles.


179
0:8:9,57 --> 0:8:13,84
This was actually that one
he rode in Marseilles.


180
0:8:13,84 --> 0:8:16,68
That was the one where
he got 13th place.


181
0:8:16,68 --> 0:8:18,996
That was pretty gnarly,
stoked on out.


182
0:8:18,996 --> 0:8:19,89
INTERVIEWER: That was
an Am contest?


183
0:8:19,89 --> 0:8:21,5
MARK OBLOW: No, it was pro.


184
0:8:21,5 --> 0:8:24,48
It was pro, that was when he
did, and that was before


185
0:8:24,48 --> 0:8:27,84
anyone, I mean, I saw doing
them was the no-comply


186
0:8:27,84 --> 0:8:29,1
tail-side reverts.


187
0:8:29,1 --> 0:8:32,48
He did that in there,
in one of his runs.


188
0:8:32,48 --> 0:8:35,743
And then he did like, there was
a wall, a vert wall, and


189
0:8:35,743 --> 0:8:38,59
he did like, kick flip front
side wall rides, and kick flip


190
0:8:38,59 --> 0:8:41,909
backside wall rides, but like
super high and popping.


191
0:8:41,909 --> 0:8:43,38
He was skating more
like, doing more


192
0:8:43,38 --> 0:8:44,84
technical and flip stuff.


193
0:8:44,84 --> 0:8:47,78
It was good, I think, it was
just good for him to like


194
0:8:47,78 --> 0:8:52,78
break out of the little
rail kid deal.


195
0:8:52,78 --> 0:8:56,15
JERRY HSU: After all the Osiris
stuff, I would just


196
0:8:56,15 --> 0:8:57,2
kind of see him around.


197
0:8:57,2 --> 0:8:59,89
I didn't see him for years,
and then he just grew up.


198
0:8:59,89 --> 0:9:2,13
I guess I feel kind
of like proud.


199
0:9:2,13 --> 0:9:4,71
It's not like I played like
a big part in his life, or


200
0:9:4,71 --> 0:9:7,6
anything, but it was just cool
to see him go from like a


201
0:9:7,6 --> 0:9:11,39
little kid to just like a full
blown, like totally well


202
0:9:11,39 --> 0:9:13,386
respected skater.


203
0:9:13,386 --> 0:9:16,506
INTERVIEWER: Are you psyched
to be in another episode?


204
0:9:16,506 --> 0:9:23,17
DYLAN RIEDER: Yeah, I feel like
it's good that I make my


205
0:9:23,17 --> 0:9:25,69
cameo every three or
four episodes.


206
0:9:25,69 --> 0:9:26,59
That's good.


207
0:9:26,59 --> 0:9:28,71
INTERVIEWER: You're in the
[INAUDIBLE] for no reason.


208
0:9:28,71 --> 0:9:30,696
DYLAN RIEDER: Yeah like--


209
0:9:30,696 --> 0:9:33,111
INTERVIEWER: [INAUDIBLE]
occasionally pan over to you


210
0:9:33,111 --> 0:9:33,6
[INAUDIBLE]


211
0:9:33,6 --> 0:9:36,94
DYLAN RIEDER: Yeah, Yeah, I
don't know, that day I just


212
0:9:36,94 --> 0:9:38,19
felt like being in an episode.


213
0:9:38,19 --> 0:11:38,19
