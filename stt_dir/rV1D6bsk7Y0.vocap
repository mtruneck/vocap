###14 ERIC KOSTON: Things started to get a little different over at
###17 World with Rocco.
###19 He was always able to throw money around and, oh, if you
###24 do this, I'll give you $100, and he'd just
###26 have a wad of cash.
###28 After a time, it was fun, we would always get cash off him.
###33 Being young, we didn't trust him.
###36 Everyone started to mutually feel that way, but never did
###40 we get to the source of it and talk it out and, hey, Rocco,
###43 man, are you ripping us off?
###46 None of us were old enough or responsible enough to confront
###50 something like that.
###50 It's like, oh, no, I'm convinced.
###53 Fuck that dude.
###53 Let's bounce, and that was it.
###55 TIM GAVIN: We were riding for Blind at the time.
###57 I remember in '92, that's when he started to hang out more
###62 with Guy, and Rudy, and me, and Henry.
###67 And then I would bring the dude up to LA periodically.
###70 And I don't know when Eric really got the cool
###73 card with the crew.
###75 I don't know when that happened.
###76 
###78 I don't--
###79 I think it was we evolved as friends during
###82 those Plan B years.
###83 In that two year span, we all got really close.
###86 GUY MARIANO: We started going up to San Diego to hang out
###88 with Eric and skate with Eric, and I think Eric was coming
###90 down here a little bit more.
###92 I did a lot of World Park days with Eric, and that was
###95 interesting because if you've ever seen Eric skate a skate
###98 park, it's amazing.
###99 And you can only imagine him at a super young age just
###102 really going for it.
###103 I remember when we started Girl, we were actually off of
###106 Wilshire at Macy's, this ledge off stairs.
###109 And it was me, Tim, Henry Sanchez, and Eric, and Rick
###114 was telling us he's thinking about starting this company
###116 and he wanted all of us to ride for it.
###118 ERIC KOSTON: I remembering me and Guy going, sure.
###122 Let's do it.
###124 Didn't really even second guess it.
###126 That would be awesome.
###127 AARON MEZA: I heard about it that weekend they came out at
###130 the contest.
###130 Mike York was like, everybody just quit World.
###133 They all started this company.
###135 ERIC KOSTON: What's funny is that that Back to the City
###136 contest, in SF, I was already up there just skating.
###140 And [INAUDIBLE]
###140 came up to the contest, and then I wanted to tell him.
###143 And he just looked at me and he goes, are you leaving too?
###148 And I was like, yeah.
###149 And he was like, all right.
###152 The team was sick.
###153 It was all the dudes that we hung out and skated with
###156 anyway, so it was perfect.
###158 TIM GAVIN: I was the last dude to get on Girl.
###161 Eric was definitely on before me, because I was the last
###163 dude on, literally.
###164 
###167 I really befriended Eric.
###169 We just became tighter.
###171 He moved up to LA, and we moved in together.
###174 
###177 I think we were the only dudes that had an
###178 apartment in our crew.
###181 MIKE CARROLL: His house was definitely the crash pad.
###182 It was just staying up until like 5:00 in the morning
###185 playing "Mortal Kombat" and then getting up at 2:00 or
###189 3:00 in the afternoon, going and eating burritos, and then
###193 maybe hit a spot that day and skate, and then just do that
###199 same old thing.
###200 
###203 ERIC KOSTON: We were one of the first ones to have a
###204 place, so it's the play house, basically.
###210 It's the place that there's no adults, and we started to
###216 drink a bit and want to get chicks.
###220 I feel like Schner was the one who brought the Arizona
###225 drinking aspect into it.
###226 
###229 TIM GAVIN: He never was interested in drinking or
###231 smoking pot, but whenever he did, he was a
###234 total fucking disaster.
###235 I remember this one time he fucking drank, and I think it
###238 was the first time he smoked weed, and he ate a box of
###240 Cheez Its, and just fucking threw up.
###244 The entire house was fucking orange.
###245 MIKE CARROLL: I forget who it was, but someone walked in on
###247 Eric on all fours on his bed after drinking Jaeger or
###252 something like that, just puking onto his bed.
###255 It was that age for everyone.
###257 Everyone's first drinking experience, drinking the
###259 shittiest Cisco and all that shit.
###261 MALE SPEAKER: People were telling me about Mike York
###263 pissing in one of your shoes.
###264 
###267 That was a story that came up.
###268 ERIC KOSTON: Dude, I still have the shoe.
###269 MALE SPEAKER: No.
###270 ERIC KOSTON: Yeah.
###271 York, what the fuck are you doing?
###273 And he just mumbled and he was just like [MUMBLES], and his
###277 back's to me, so he's just like [MUMBLE].
###280 TIM GAVIN: Apparently Mike York does that a lot.
###282 I guess he's known to take a walk sleeping and piss in
###287 random places.
###288 Eric was so devastated about this piss in
###290 his Air-Pacs, man.
###291 It was fucking hilarious.
###293 I mean, fuck, those were our college years.
###295 Those were fraternities, our dorm rooms.
###298 I would do anything to get back there and be living with
###300 Eric again.
###302 It was lame, but it was the best times of our lives, dude.
###305 GUY MARIANO: We would wake up in the morning, he'd make egg
###307 McMuffin sandwiches for everybody and coffee.
###311 He's the man.
###313 It was Koston, dude.
###314 Koston used to make me breakfast every morning, and
###317 for that matter, like five other people.
###319 AARON MEZA: I wouldn't even be like, hey dude, is
###322 it cool if I stay?
###323 We'd all stay there.
###324 Mike Carroll, York, everybody.
###326 We'd stay there forever.
###328 I mean, if you know Eric, he's super generous, but I don't
###331 think he necessarily wanted a lot of people staying at his
###333 house and making a mess of the place.
###337 He's not like fucking come one, come all, fuck yeah,
###341 party at my house.
###342 He was just dealing with it because he's so nice.
###345 I mean, he would come pick me up at the airport and we'd go
###348 skate, and it was just for years.
###350 Seriously, since "Goldfish" through the "Chocolate" tour I
###354 stayed at his house.
###355 
###359 MALE SPEAKER: Where did you start actually taking a part
###362 really serious?
###363 Or have you always?
###364 ERIC KOSTON: It was probably "Goldfish" or really wanted to
###367 get a good part.
###369 Because that was Girl's first video, too.
###371 I wanted to make sure we had a really sick video
###374 when it came out.
###375 Everybody did, just to back the company.
###378 
###384 TONY FERGUSON: It was definitely
###386 mellower, not as intense.
###390 It was more of a friendly, fun vibe, and I think that's what
###394 Mike and Rick wanted to portray.
###396 It was everyone skating together.
###398 We would go skate the same spot everyday.
###401 We'd be at the courthouse.
###402 
###411 That was just to take it back to funner times.
###418 MALE SPEAKER: Do you remember the first time
###419 you filmed with him?
###420 AARON MEZA: I remember filming a line with him at [INAUDIBLE]
###423 that was super long with tons of hard tricks.
###426 I think he backside heelflips over a wall in "Goldfish." I
###430 just couldn't believe how much good stuff was in
###432 it how long it was.
###435 I wouldn't necessarily say every time we went out we got
###437 something, but it's pretty obvious he was definitely
###440 fucking so naturally talented.
###441 I think the most naturally talented skater ever.
###444 Back then when he was young and carefree and only had to
###447 skate, it was a joke how he could do anything.
###454 SAM SMYTH: And now I see more people like that.
###459 I feel like, at the time, he might have been the only one
###463 that I've ever seen work that way or skate that way, where
###468 he could do anything that he dreamt of.
###469 
###476 ATIBA JEFFERSON: Back then, it didn't seem like skateboarding
###478 was his main focus.
###480 It seemed like being a young kid was his main focus.
###484 I mean, I really watched skating turn
###488 into his main priority.
###489 
###492 "Mouse," you saw it.
###493 That part to me is you're seeing, oh, he's finally
###496 taking skating seriously.
###498 He's finally using his potential.
###502 His "Mouse" part, Eric's part.
###505 His video parts have always been better and better.
###510 I don't know, dude.
###511 He's just good.
###512 
###517 GUY MARIANO: During "Mouse," me and Eric were really close.
###521 I was definitely living with him at the time.
###523 
###526 I liked being around Eric.
###527 He pushed me on a skateboard.
###530 I think things would have been a lot different if I didn't
###533 spend a lot of time with Eric.
###535 I don't think I would be as good of a skateboarder.
###538 Not to say that I was on Eric's level.
###540 Eric's always been way above me.
###542 But I looked to Eric for what was the next thing, and what
###545 was possible.
###546 
###550 TONY FERGUSON: Sometimes the video doesn't give it justice.
###553 [INAUDIBLE], we were skating down with Eric one time,
###556 because he did five tricks in 10 minutes on this rail.
###566 It was insane.
###567 He did nollie 50-50, and he was like,
###572 oh, I like this rail.
###573 He did nollie frontside noseslide, nollie frontside
###575 nose grind, and then nollie frontside nose blunt.
###578 
###581 TIM GAVIN: Everyone knows Eric's good.
###582 I want to tell this, though.
###585 In the "Mouse" video, when I did that 50-50, I remember
###588 Eric was trying it too, and I did that before Eric did, and
###591 it made it in the video.
###592 
###595 I had to get that on record.
###597 I mean, I consider Eric one of my best friends.
###601 I've known the guy for 20 years, lived with him for 10,
###604 I fucking barely know the guy.
###607 ATIBA JEFFERSON: For a dude who mumbles and is the worst
###609 guy to talk to on the phone and have a conversation with,
###613 he really is good at acting not like himself.
###617 Even the Charlie Chaplin thing, his personality and
###621 charisma is so good, I'm very surprised he
###623 didn't go into acting.
###625 
###627 SPIKE JONZE: The one with Eric as Charlie Chaplin, we were
###631 shooting something else that day, I forget
###633 what we were doing.
###634 Something at the warehouse.
###635 And then we wanted to do that too.
###637 And the thing that made that one work is Eric had never
###640 heard of Charlie Chaplin, or I guess he'd heard of him, but
###642 never seen any of his stuff.
###644 So I bought him a box set of Charlie Chaplin VHSs, and he
###648 went home and watched it over and over again.
###650 And OK, here's what makes Charlie Chaplin funny.
###652 And he went and just sort of studied his Charlie Chaplin.
###657 I guess, knowing Eric, if he's going to do something, he's
###660 going to take it seriously.
###663 AARON MEZA: I feel like he's like a lot of the dudes that
###665 have to do it, he can pull it off.
###667 They moved into the old man thing, he was
###671 pretty fine with it.
###673 That's pretty hard to have to do that stuff, but I feel like
###675 he has done better than some of the other guys.
###678 Where someone like Tim was awkward about it, or just way
###682 nervous, I feel like he's always been pretty good at
###686 that stuff.
###688 SPIKE JONZE: Yeah, we'd done a set of boards with everyone
###690 old a few years before that, so it came out of that idea.
###694 
###699 Whatever dumb idea that anyone comes up
###702 with, it's made a reality.
###704 
###711 I don't know if they ever pulled that
###713 out for the box set.
###714 The dailies of that stuff, I could've just
###716 watched that for an hour.
###717 That stuff's best.
###718 What school are we from?
###720 MALE SPEAKER: We're from Santa Monica Community College.
###723 SPIKE JONZE: OK, Santa Monica, what about Santa Barbara
###725 Community College?
###726 MALE SPEAKER: Santa Monica City College.
###727 SPIKE JONZE: You stop and you're sipping your coffee,
###729 and you look up and down the street.
###731 You see a set of stairs, and then you get an idea.
###735 You start pushing, and pushing harder, and pushing harder,
###737 and then racing towards the stairs and then launch down
###740 the stairs.
###741 And then in slow motion, close up view with
###743 wind in your hair.
###744 
###747 And then you land, come to a stop, and proudly look back at
###751 the stairs you've conquered on your wheelchair.
###753
