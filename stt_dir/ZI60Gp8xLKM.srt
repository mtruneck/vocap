1
0:0:0,8 --> 0:0:3,48
friended me on wed held out hope that
jane was wrong as predictions that there


2
0:0:3,48 --> 0:0:6,95
would be a grand bargain it looks like
uh... you're wasting your time wasting


3
0:0:6,95 --> 0:0:11,7
your hope actually because the next
wednesday we're going to have com


4
0:0:11,7 --> 0:0:14,48
president bombers budget proposal
waverly details out on it and it doesn't


5
0:0:14,48 --> 0:0:17,529
look good there's massive entitlement
about cuts coming


6
0:0:17,529 --> 0:0:21,0
approach to medicare cuts the social
security as well as other cuts too


7
0:0:21,0 --> 0:0:25,29
together details for every of them are
summoned details of what's going to be


8
0:0:25,29 --> 0:0:26,439
because next week


9
0:0:26,439 --> 0:0:30,289
uh... so their overall it's expected to
reduce the deficit by one point eight


10
0:0:30,289 --> 0:0:32,36
trillion dollars over ten years


11
0:0:32,36 --> 0:0:35,63
how does the end of the number of
different ways that we'd be having


12
0:0:35,63 --> 0:0:37,52
having four hundred billion dollars in


13
0:0:37,52 --> 0:0:40,57
uh... healthcare savings or custard and
how you look at it


14
0:0:40,57 --> 0:0:43,8
uh... means testing of certain benefits
and medicare


15
0:0:43,8 --> 0:0:47,94
uh... a big change in how benefits or
dole down so security that they've


16
0:0:47,94 --> 0:0:52,24
changed c_p_i_ is going be reintroduced
things above article we've been opposing


17
0:0:52,24 --> 0:0:52,87
that


18
0:0:52,87 --> 0:0:55,2
uh... some of the good things that were
actually have not


19
0:0:55,2 --> 0:0:58,63
he's gonna be paying to expand access to
pre-k education


20
0:0:58,63 --> 0:1:2,77
there's any limits at contact for for
retirement accounts for the wealthy and


21
0:1:2,77 --> 0:1:6,1
also there's gonna be admission of the
semester to be stopping people from


22
0:1:6,1 --> 0:1:8,18
collecting full disability benefits


23
0:1:8,18 --> 0:1:10,35
and unemployment benefits at the same
time


24
0:1:10,35 --> 0:1:12,19
uh... so so it is good some of its bad


25
0:1:12,19 --> 0:1:13,39
yet most of it is bad


26
0:1:13,39 --> 0:1:16,37
and uh... is as far as central to them


27
0:1:16,37 --> 0:1:19,51
okay right or im go with what now


28
0:1:19,51 --> 0:1:22,46
uh... i changed c_p_i_ personal security
sounds


29
0:1:22,46 --> 0:1:25,42
complicated like i have the casey
periods of time or place don't worry


30
0:1:25,42 --> 0:1:26,1
about it


31
0:1:26,1 --> 0:1:27,37
is about the disaster


32
0:1:27,37 --> 0:1:28,5
and uh...


33
0:1:28,5 --> 0:1:32,1
and look let's just get right to it
uh... real liberals are saying real


34
0:1:32,1 --> 0:1:36,42
progress is arce was primary all the
democrats uh... who vote for this part


35
0:1:36,42 --> 0:1:39,22
now of course fee failure democrat you
bad


36
0:1:39,22 --> 0:1:42,84
voted yes to services massive
consequently all my god if you vote for


37
0:1:42,84 --> 0:1:47,18
gun control watch out so that they all
panicky don't vote for well they should


38
0:1:47,18 --> 0:1:52,4
be some god damn consequences if you go
to customers security is a democrat so


39
0:1:52,4 --> 0:1:55,23
out you know allot of people of
different reels on in my opinion is


40
0:1:55,23 --> 0:1:59,16
absolutely clear they give you the
numbers first before i get into obama's


41
0:1:59,16 --> 0:2:1,77
horrible rediculous


42
0:2:1,77 --> 0:2:5,409
alley but their strategy projected at a
lot of additives


43
0:2:5,409 --> 0:2:9,58
bernie sanders recent reports in her
eighty five years-old it up to you only


44
0:2:9,58 --> 0:2:12,739
get a twelve dollars a month right from
so secure that's not what you're getting


45
0:2:12,739 --> 0:2:13,72
rid of it


46
0:2:13,72 --> 0:2:15,759
twelve hundred a month that's it right


47
0:2:15,759 --> 0:2:18,54
as an example eighty-five let's assume
you're not that's in addition to


48
0:2:18,54 --> 0:2:21,69
whatever you're making from your job


49
0:2:21,69 --> 0:2:24,619
drive a role marketing is allowed to be
worded it probably does that point


50
0:2:24,619 --> 0:2:28,249
anyway which a c_p_i_ but the judge and
the one market


51
0:2:28,249 --> 0:2:31,699
spending etc it's like the old here and
we should do it by like it but i don't


52
0:2:31,699 --> 0:2:33,949
know because she never from conversation


53
0:2:33,949 --> 0:2:38,499
she tells that ever happened about well
timeouts back in a thousand dollars a


54
0:2:38,499 --> 0:2:38,929
year


55
0:2:38,929 --> 0:2:40,749
lasts because of this deal


56
0:2:40,749 --> 0:2:42,679
afoul city year you know how much
interest


57
0:2:42,679 --> 0:2:44,989
but their millionaire it's not that big
a deal


58
0:2:44,989 --> 0:2:47,29
you're living off of twelve hundred a
month


59
0:2:47,29 --> 0:2:50,279
have thousand lessons terrible as


60
0:2:50,279 --> 0:2:53,389
and look it's not just that first of all


61
0:2:53,389 --> 0:2:56,869
we're looking at so many different
numbers that are going to hurt including


62
0:2:56,869 --> 0:3:0,799
uh... veterans by the way let me give
you the moron swiss favors or it could


63
0:3:0,799 --> 0:3:2,349
have a sixty five-year-old


64
0:3:2,349 --> 0:3:5,81
period six hundred fifty dollars a year
lesson benefits seventy five-year-old a


65
0:3:5,81 --> 0:3:9,529
thousand dollars as i'm sorry eighty
five-year-old seventy five thousand


66
0:3:9,529 --> 0:3:10,639
uh...


67
0:3:10,639 --> 0:3:11,65
and so


68
0:3:11,65 --> 0:3:14,55
then we will get better and c_b_s_
thirty-year-olds


69
0:3:14,55 --> 0:3:18,459
young people to others than others and
he said this is all that benefits


70
0:3:18,459 --> 0:3:21,58
you are right now your legs blown off
you got your prize


71
0:3:21,58 --> 0:3:27,9
uh... blow their socks pops up at least
applied to grad forty-seven disabilities


72
0:3:27,9 --> 0:3:30,21
eleven things they could happen he was
sad day for you if you're a


73
0:3:30,21 --> 0:3:31,849
thirty-year-old uh...


74
0:3:31,849 --> 0:3:34,679
you're gonna lose fourteen hundred
dollars a year from this plan by that


75
0:3:34,679 --> 0:3:39,119
time you reach age forty five but i'm
reaching age fifty five dollars two


76
0:3:39,119 --> 0:3:43,539
thousand three hundred dollars a year
but any rich age sixty five losing three


77
0:3:43,539 --> 0:3:47,879
thousand two hundred dollars a year now
that's every single year they take out


78
0:3:47,879 --> 0:3:49,66
your body to get out your private


79
0:3:49,66 --> 0:3:51,46
by the way you know what you do


80
0:3:51,46 --> 0:3:55,659
that would give it almost the same exact
amount of savings you can get rid of


81
0:3:55,659 --> 0:3:59,79
just one offshore tax even will pull


82
0:3:59,79 --> 0:4:2,839
there would be raised in a ballpark with
the same hundred eleven twelve billion


83
0:4:2,839 --> 0:4:3,639
dollars


84
0:4:3,639 --> 0:4:6,74
so we can get rid of what loophole for
corporations


85
0:4:6,74 --> 0:4:10,75
or we can draw on social security
recipients we brought better is and


86
0:4:10,75 --> 0:4:13,119
whether it is one extra little


87
0:4:13,119 --> 0:4:14,389
shipping here


88
0:4:14,389 --> 0:4:17,6
it also affects taxes thing you know
what effects


89
0:4:17,6 --> 0:4:22,7
not millionaires it is an incredibly
regressive form of attacks increase


90
0:4:22,7 --> 0:4:24,229
the people i gave her the most


91
0:4:24,229 --> 0:4:27,55
of the people in the bracket of thirty
to forty thousand dollars a year


92
0:4:27,55 --> 0:4:30,74
and uh... and you know the the one of
the things you hear that


93
0:4:30,74 --> 0:4:33,419
that liberals like that i like is the


94
0:4:33,419 --> 0:4:37,909
funding for prekindergarten v which is
good obscene credibly by twenty kids in


95
0:4:37,909 --> 0:4:41,8
the school then with that's clear to
everyone except conservatives who don't


96
0:4:41,8 --> 0:4:43,13
believe in any sort of study


97
0:4:43,13 --> 0:4:47,379
for that but but it's being funded by a
increase in tobacco facts


98
0:4:47,379 --> 0:4:48,379
which i guess


99
0:4:48,379 --> 0:4:52,74
on some level but i mean the only people
that get if you're a millionaire smoker


100
0:4:52,74 --> 0:4:54,849
whatever other tobacco tax


101
0:4:54,849 --> 0:4:57,319
but if your base is forty five thousand
dollars a year in your addictive


102
0:4:57,319 --> 0:4:59,37
cigarettes are deep and what your pain


103
0:4:59,37 --> 0:5:2,49
like it used to get you to getting
things that are going


104
0:5:2,49 --> 0:5:5,69
and going about it and making the wrong
people


105
0:5:5,69 --> 0:5:7,84
but the thing that bothers me the most
about this in this there's a lot of


106
0:5:7,84 --> 0:5:9,809
things that you're gonna touch on is
that


107
0:5:9,809 --> 0:5:13,489
it's bad enough when you see wake okay
the republicans are able to is the


108
0:5:13,489 --> 0:5:15,449
democratic presidents arm and


109
0:5:15,449 --> 0:5:19,36
we give you the estate tax for two years
or something like that that was hurts


110
0:5:19,36 --> 0:5:22,439
but they are fundamentally changing the
way that the benefits are doled out


111
0:5:22,439 --> 0:5:26,99
there it's going to hurt not for two
years but for decades and decades until


112
0:5:26,99 --> 0:5:28,4
eventually hopefully this is changed
back


113
0:5:28,4 --> 0:5:33,199
but he's a he's prematurely compromising
in such along a lasting sense


114
0:5:33,199 --> 0:5:37,0
there long after he's dead many
presidents later it's just going to


115
0:5:37,0 --> 0:5:40,37
continue to bring to the does it it's
not in flex indexed to inflation in the


116
0:5:40,37 --> 0:5:41,419
correct way


117
0:5:41,419 --> 0:5:44,33
the gap is only going to get bigger and
bigger over time


118
0:5:44,33 --> 0:5:47,83
but imagine this is going to be a
massive problem in a few decades


119
0:5:47,83 --> 0:5:51,1
all right c_n_n_'s pass a problem for
the people who couldn't use the forty


120
0:5:51,1 --> 0:5:53,249
thousand president while my kids


121
0:5:53,249 --> 0:5:58,239
all the time visa told fraud in terms of
being a soap opera recife look to give


122
0:5:58,239 --> 0:6:1,859
you a sense that it's not just that look
do you think that barry and you don't


123
0:6:1,859 --> 0:6:6,75
mind i think that's all much back in tax
increases for the rage that you know


124
0:6:6,75 --> 0:6:9,729
you know there's still the the notes the
most painful thing you did you know


125
0:6:9,729 --> 0:6:11,269
anticipate is a progressive


126
0:6:11,269 --> 0:6:16,409
now as usual near new york times is than
effort to demonstrate his willingness to


127
0:6:16,409 --> 0:6:19,84
compromise with republicans he is
putting it off


128
0:6:19,84 --> 0:6:23,939
again we've got it economy come on a
compromise with the republicans


129
0:6:23,939 --> 0:6:26,5
we don't have that message already


130
0:6:26,5 --> 0:6:29,639
ownership you know it's not like
compromise in the republic's yes i do


131
0:6:29,639 --> 0:6:34,8
agree with republicans what house
republicans will enable republicans


132
0:6:34,8 --> 0:6:37,659
it says this will not be embodied the
final compromise offer


133
0:6:37,659 --> 0:6:38,759
check that


134
0:6:38,759 --> 0:6:40,169
you have


135
0:6:40,169 --> 0:6:44,129
it was the essay today suspected there
might all ticket and i'll give you


136
0:6:44,129 --> 0:6:46,36
nothing in return so are you


137
0:6:46,36 --> 0:6:50,469
roles are whatever we agree on good
cutting so security and medicare i'll


138
0:6:50,469 --> 0:6:53,74
take it you'll get nothing here okay
here's the thing here's the question you


139
0:6:53,74 --> 0:6:56,759
have to answer 'cause i disagree about
which of the target use of the figure as


140
0:6:56,759 --> 0:6:57,509
anybody else


141
0:6:57,509 --> 0:6:59,599
when you pledge to know what he actually
thinks


142
0:6:59,599 --> 0:7:2,559
hotel transactions


143
0:7:2,559 --> 0:7:7,279
and that is a corporate is not many guys
that one hundred-percent corporations


144
0:7:7,279 --> 0:7:12,729
any tax cuts structural proper though
the patterns arrived at her we're not


145
0:7:12,729 --> 0:7:15,85
going to hear the president of states
stop yelling


146
0:7:15,85 --> 0:7:18,949
and tell me what you do with the house
that would be denied what would you


147
0:7:18,949 --> 0:7:24,789
all nato believe has p_c_s_ how i would
do it makes it look nicer offshore tax


148
0:7:24,789 --> 0:7:25,889
havens


149
0:7:25,889 --> 0:7:28,59
this some thought that is a protected


150
0:7:28,59 --> 0:7:32,3
okay at one o'clock p_m_ bear comes into
my office every day asking to cut your


151
0:7:32,3 --> 0:7:37,409
social security i'm gonna get record
pieces you know i think that


152
0:7:37,409 --> 0:7:38,46
obama's only one


153
0:7:38,46 --> 0:7:40,91
sings like associate what we did say


154
0:7:40,91 --> 0:7:41,819
obon i said it


155
0:7:41,819 --> 0:7:45,589
hot movies that make a big issue for
house through but are you as a


156
0:7:45,589 --> 0:7:49,11
politician a little bit of work missus
and as we listen to lease the political


157
0:7:49,11 --> 0:7:50,869
argument here


158
0:7:50,869 --> 0:7:52,93
alarms you disagree with you guys
because


159
0:7:52,93 --> 0:7:55,3
your positive that end up hurting about
that


160
0:7:55,3 --> 0:7:58,88
and to meet the only person with any
credibility to cut social security


161
0:7:58,88 --> 0:8:2,46
is a democrat i don't think he should do
it by spending cuts make good on a


162
0:8:2,46 --> 0:8:3,71
digital republican


163
0:8:3,71 --> 0:8:6,56
presumably so that the credibility
'cause lister democrats have


164
0:8:6,56 --> 0:8:10,629
pro-democratic process started we don't
know i have been a great you know you're


165
0:8:10,629 --> 0:8:13,4
gonna get a deal where you have to cut
social security


166
0:8:13,4 --> 0:8:16,96
then their argument is we strike is a
fairly reasonable one


167
0:8:16,96 --> 0:8:20,28
that you should make the move and saying
this is what we're gonna cut this isn't


168
0:8:20,28 --> 0:8:21,89
nothing more


169
0:8:21,89 --> 0:8:24,68
method of cutting more which visit
totally fair argument to make


170
0:8:24,68 --> 0:8:26,55
but from a political point of view


171
0:8:26,55 --> 0:8:28,2
that at least that there are good


172
0:8:28,2 --> 0:8:29,72
tumi that you strike first


173
0:8:29,72 --> 0:8:31,71
and layout that position will get but


174
0:8:31,71 --> 0:8:35,679
in his writing first he's laying out
it's already a about three to one


175
0:8:35,679 --> 0:8:40,159
three times much cuts is the right to on
things now done by the way not only the


176
0:8:40,159 --> 0:8:43,7
only way you could be two point five
trillion across the road in may


177
0:8:43,7 --> 0:8:46,11
so far the cuts they've already made and
the tax increases


178
0:8:46,11 --> 0:8:49,39
it's eighty percent spending-cuts twenty
percent tax increases


179
0:8:49,39 --> 0:8:51,99
so he is already at four oh one right


180
0:8:51,99 --> 0:8:54,79
and this is a guy to get a much better
okay


181
0:8:54,79 --> 0:8:55,579
what ben


182
0:8:55,579 --> 0:8:58,499
if this was the first time it happened
you've become this angry


183
0:8:58,499 --> 0:9:2,629
but he was we sought no i'd vote for the
guy who it was so excited change will be


184
0:9:2,629 --> 0:9:5,55
on the other better than the
establishment of the clinton as in the


185
0:9:5,55 --> 0:9:9,689
first time i've seen this movie a
hundred times what is the industrial


186
0:9:9,689 --> 0:9:13,18
company such as they get 'em absolutely
nothing anyone's of weakening this


187
0:9:13,18 --> 0:9:16,889
so-called position but the reason i tell
you not that what i know when it's in
