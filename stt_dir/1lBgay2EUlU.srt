ADRI MURGUIA: On any given
Friday night, thousands of


3
0:0:14,6 --> 0:0:18,34
Peruvians gather in Lima to
attend Huayno concerts.


4
0:0:18,34 --> 0:0:21,552
As a sign of industry success,
the queens of Huayno take the


5
0:0:21,552 --> 0:0:23,9
center of the stage, wearing
dresses that look like a


6
0:0:23,9 --> 0:0:26,23
combination of Virgin
Mary cloaks and a


7
0:0:26,23 --> 0:0:27,48
flair of kabuki theater.


8
0:0:27,48 --> 0:0:40,74



9
0:0:40,74 --> 0:0:43,655
Located in the outskirts of the
city, El Arte Dorado owned


10
0:0:43,655 --> 0:0:46,58
by Francisco Herrera, is
regarded as the best Huayno


11
0:0:46,58 --> 0:0:47,83
dress shop in the country.

0:0:52,36 --> 0:1:0,14



15
0:1:0,14 --> 0:1:2,15
ADRI MURGUIA: Francisco's
craftsmanship is responsible


16
0:1:2,15 --> 0:1:4,67
for launching the careers of
some of the most iconic women


17
0:1:4,67 --> 0:1:9,46
in the scene, amongst them,
national idol Dina Paucar.

22
0:1:22,11 --> 0:1:23,92
ADRI MURGUIA: Acquiring one
of these dresses is a huge


23
0:1:23,92 --> 0:1:26,61
investment for aspiring
musicians, but it's impossible


24
0:1:26,61 --> 0:1:28,84
to perform without one.

YouTube sensation Wendy Sulca


32
0:1:45,95 --> 0:1:50,24

most prominent customers.

ADRI MURGUIA: Francisco owns
several buildings on this


36
0:2:12,71 --> 0:2:15,27
block, but he took us to his
studio next door, where his


37
0:2:15,27 --> 0:2:18,2
team of artisans assemble
his designs.


38
0:2:18,2 --> 0:2:20,8
He wanted to show us the
intricacies that go into


39
0:2:20,8 --> 0:2:21,33
making them.

ADRI MURGUIA: The blend of Incan
symbols with baroque


45
0:2:57,86 --> 0:3:0,57
influences not only help the
singers narrate their personal


46
0:3:0,57 --> 0:3:3,135
stories, but also serve to
represent Peru's culture


47
0:3:3,135 --> 0:3:4,89
around the world.

ADRI MURGUIA: Playing for
Peruvians that have migrated


53
0:3:16,95 --> 0:3:20,12
abroad is a big deal
for Huayno stars.


54
0:3:20,12 --> 0:3:25,44
It's an unmistakable sign
that you've made it.


55
0:3:25,44 --> 0:3:28,43
Considering the burning desire
for Huayno starlets to show


56
0:3:28,43 --> 0:3:30,86
off these ensembles convinced
me that I just had to bring


57
0:3:30,86 --> 0:3:32,11
one back with me to New York.
