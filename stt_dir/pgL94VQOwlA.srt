1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:16,49



2
0:0:16,49 --> 0:0:19,37
ARTO SAARI: I first met
Dylan in Barcelona.


3
0:0:19,37 --> 0:0:22,73
He was just a little kid, and
he had massive audios on,


4
0:0:22,73 --> 0:0:28,95
birdhouse board, hat backwards,
long hair--


5
0:0:28,95 --> 0:0:30,33
same long hair.


6
0:0:30,33 --> 0:0:33,87
And he must have been
like 14 or 15.


7
0:0:33,87 --> 0:0:37,434
He didn't talk much back then.


8
0:0:37,434 --> 0:0:38,41
INTERVIEWER: He was
really quiet?


9
0:0:38,41 --> 0:0:40,59
ARTO SAARI: Yeah, he
was pretty quiet.


10
0:0:40,59 --> 0:0:42,97
I was recovering from my
first knee injury.


11
0:0:42,97 --> 0:0:45,59
I wasn't able to skate,
but I was just wanted


12
0:0:45,59 --> 0:0:46,45
to go out and stuff.


13
0:0:46,45 --> 0:0:47,74
It was just me and him.


14
0:0:47,74 --> 0:0:50,93
I ended up filming him on some
random spot, skating.


15
0:0:50,93 --> 0:0:53,9
I was like, come on,
do something.


16
0:0:53,9 --> 0:0:55,75
I'm pointing the
camera at you.


17
0:0:55,75 --> 0:0:55,78
INTERVIEWER: You were filming?


18
0:0:55,78 --> 0:0:57,45
ARTO SAARI: Yeah, I
was filming him.


19
0:0:57,45 --> 0:0:59,36
And I think Anton was around.


20
0:0:59,36 --> 0:1:2,31
So I just tried to shoot a
couple of photos and stuff.


21
0:1:2,31 --> 0:1:5,37
But no, he didn't have
a crazy kid style.


22
0:1:5,37 --> 0:1:6,78
It was like--


23
0:1:6,78 --> 0:1:10,92
or maybe it was right at that
time that he started


24
0:1:10,92 --> 0:1:12,31
developing it.


25
0:1:12,31 --> 0:1:14,64
It was early, early stages
of his style.


26
0:1:14,64 --> 0:1:17,33
No, he was already
good back then.


27
0:1:17,33 --> 0:1:19,72
He was actually [INAUDIBLE]
before me, I think.


28
0:1:19,72 --> 0:1:22,64
MARK OBLOW: Basically once he
started coming on all the


29
0:1:22,64 --> 0:1:26,44
quick trips, he just started
coming into his own.


30
0:1:26,44 --> 0:1:29,27
And then at that time, Reese
was a pretty big


31
0:1:29,27 --> 0:1:30,3
influence on him.


32
0:1:30,3 --> 0:1:32,3
And then Reese started
Rasa Libre.


33
0:1:32,3 --> 0:1:34,9
And basically they were just
like, come to Rasa Libre.


34
0:1:34,9 --> 0:1:36,31
And it was on.


35
0:1:36,31 --> 0:1:42,15



36
0:1:42,15 --> 0:1:45,97
DYLAN RIEDER: Reese asked me to
ride for him, Reese Forbes,


37
0:1:45,97 --> 0:1:47,44
because he started
it with Matt.


38
0:1:47,44 --> 0:1:49,1
He asked me to ride for him.


39
0:1:49,1 --> 0:1:50,68
I was like, yeah, fuck
it, let's do it.


40
0:1:50,68 --> 0:1:51,97
INTERVIEWER: It seemed like
it had really good


41
0:1:51,97 --> 0:1:53,86
art direction, also.


42
0:1:53,86 --> 0:1:54,89
DYLAN RIEDER: The graphics
were sick, man.


43
0:1:54,89 --> 0:1:56,25
They had awesome graphics.


44
0:1:56,25 --> 0:1:59,61
I think it was all like Michael
Leon and stuff.


45
0:1:59,61 --> 0:2:0,63
I don't know if you ever
saw the board.


46
0:2:0,63 --> 0:2:3,62
It was like, the wine
bottles, and like


47
0:2:3,62 --> 0:2:4,74
the flowers and stuff.


48
0:2:4,74 --> 0:2:10,169
And then there was this one with
this snake stuff on the


49
0:2:10,169 --> 0:2:13,15
back of it, just blank wood.


50
0:2:13,15 --> 0:2:14,81
There was a bunch
of cool ones.


51
0:2:14,81 --> 0:2:15,91
I think a lot of people
were paying


52
0:2:15,91 --> 0:2:17,37
attention to Rasa Libre.


53
0:2:17,37 --> 0:2:20,6
It was such an awesome
company.


54
0:2:20,6 --> 0:2:23,74
I think that helped me out.


55
0:2:23,74 --> 0:2:26,39
ANTHONY VAN ENGELEN: I had seen
the kid around, skating,


56
0:2:26,39 --> 0:2:29,53
and knew that there was some
special about him.


57
0:2:29,53 --> 0:2:30,97
Because no one had seen anything
of Dylan either.


58
0:2:30,97 --> 0:2:35,26
All he had was this Quicksilver
promo thing.


59
0:2:35,26 --> 0:2:40,14
MARK OBLOW: I think the
TransWorld part really set him


60
0:2:40,14 --> 0:2:43,69
from being a little kid to
being a good amateur.


61
0:2:43,69 --> 0:2:54,31



62
0:2:54,31 --> 0:2:56,42
HEATH KIRCHART: That was kind
of him coming into his own,


63
0:2:56,42 --> 0:2:58,87
showcasing his style
of skating.


64
0:2:58,87 --> 0:3:1,38
So the TransWorld video was
I think when probably most


65
0:3:1,38 --> 0:3:2,79
people learned about him.


66
0:3:2,79 --> 0:3:4,31
ANTHONY VAN ENGELEN: I feel
like he was on the--


67
0:3:4,31 --> 0:3:7,9
he was working on that,
riding for Rasa Libre.


68
0:3:7,9 --> 0:3:11,45
And then Rasa Libre fell apart,
I feel like, in the


69
0:3:11,45 --> 0:3:12,6
middle of that video.


70
0:3:12,6 --> 0:3:15,18
And he finished it out riding
Workshop boards.


71
0:3:15,18 --> 0:3:17,99
I want to say that he did.


72
0:3:17,99 --> 0:3:22,326
Or that transition was
happening, or something.


73
0:3:22,326 --> 0:3:24,45
DYLAN RIEDER: I don't really
know, honestly.


74
0:3:24,45 --> 0:3:26,9
I mean, I was pretty
young at the time.


75
0:3:26,9 --> 0:3:26,84
I didn't think it was
like, oh, it's


76
0:3:26,84 --> 0:3:27,99
going out of business.


77
0:3:27,99 --> 0:3:30,85
I mean, whatever, cool.


78
0:3:30,85 --> 0:3:32,52
MARK OBLOW: You know, at that
time, when the Rasa Libre


79
0:3:32,52 --> 0:3:37,43
thing was going out, he had
numerous phone calls from


80
0:3:37,43 --> 0:3:40,49
other sponsors that wanted
to hook him up.


81
0:3:40,49 --> 0:3:43,15
Out of all the thing when the
Rasa Libre thing went-- he was


82
0:3:43,15 --> 0:3:45,94
like, there was Omar, there was
Reese, there was all those


83
0:3:45,94 --> 0:3:47,2
guys I was dealing with.


84
0:3:47,2 --> 0:3:51,78
But Dylan was by far the most
that everyone was wanting.


85
0:3:51,78 --> 0:3:53,15
Everyone was calling,
going, all right,


86
0:3:53,15 --> 0:3:54,85
what's up with Dylan?


87
0:3:54,85 --> 0:3:56,92
GREG HUNT: People were saying
that he kind of wanted to


88
0:3:56,92 --> 0:3:59,96
maybe ride for Anti Hero,
but he wasn't sure.


89
0:3:59,96 --> 0:4:1,63
Because he was through
Deluxe, too.


90
0:4:1,63 --> 0:4:3,95
He'd been talking to
those guys, maybe.


91
0:4:3,95 --> 0:4:7,7
MARK OBLOW: Yeah, obviously
he had to get


92
0:4:7,7 --> 0:4:9,59
voted on to both companies.


93
0:4:9,59 --> 0:4:13,62
I don't think he was voted on
completely with Anti Hero.


94
0:4:13,62 --> 0:4:16,55
I knew he definitely looked
up to those dudes.


95
0:4:16,55 --> 0:4:20,63
DYLAN RIEDER: They asked me
to ride for Anti Hero.


96
0:4:20,63 --> 0:4:21,7
Which I was super psyched on.


97
0:4:21,7 --> 0:4:23,58
Then I talked to Jim.


98
0:4:23,58 --> 0:4:24,77
And he wanted me to
ride for him.


99
0:4:24,77 --> 0:4:27,41
And I remember thinking, fuck,
I don't really fit the roster


100
0:4:27,41 --> 0:4:28,33
for Anti Hero.


101
0:4:28,33 --> 0:4:32,69
I'm not a super gnarly
pool skater.


102
0:4:32,69 --> 0:4:36,13
Because at that time, there
wasn't any Vans on the team, I


103
0:4:36,13 --> 0:4:36,6
don't think.


104
0:4:36,6 --> 0:4:41,32
It was just Tony and Stranger
and Hewitt and stuff.


105
0:4:41,32 --> 0:4:46,4
I went on an Anti Hero Vans
trip, but I didn't really get


106
0:4:46,4 --> 0:4:47,2
along with one of the riders.


107
0:4:47,2 --> 0:4:51,668
So I told Stranger
I was over it.


108
0:4:51,668 --> 0:4:54,602
[LAUGHTER]


109
0:4:54,602 --> 0:4:56,45
INTERVIEWER: Do you want
to tell me who it was?


110
0:4:56,45 --> 0:4:56,42
DYLAN RIEDER: No.


111
0:4:56,42 --> 0:4:57,68
Not really.


112
0:4:57,68 --> 0:5:0,58
I probably shouldn't even
have brought that up.


113
0:5:0,58 --> 0:5:3,53
At the same time as well,
AVE had asked


114
0:5:3,53 --> 0:5:4,67
me to ride for Workshop.


115
0:5:4,67 --> 0:5:7,68
So that was a big factor
in it as well.


116
0:5:7,68 --> 0:5:7,92
I don't know.


117
0:5:7,92 --> 0:5:13,19
I just felt that Workshop was
kind of more my steez.


118
0:5:13,19 --> 0:5:16,895
And fucking AVE and
Dill and Heath


119
0:5:16,895 --> 0:5:19,66
were my favorite skaters.


120
0:5:19,66 --> 0:5:22,15
So I was like, fuck, I want to
ride for the company with all


121
0:5:22,15 --> 0:5:23,94
the dudes I look up to.


122
0:5:23,94 --> 0:5:25,93
Not too many kids get to say
they ride for their favorite


123
0:5:25,93 --> 0:5:27,47
company with their
favorite skaters.


124
0:5:27,47 --> 0:5:29,43
GREG HUNT: He got on right
before that TransWorld video


125
0:5:29,43 --> 0:5:31,6
part came out that he was in.


126
0:5:31,6 --> 0:5:34,355
And he just seemed like he
really fit, especially with


127
0:5:34,355 --> 0:5:36,5
where Workshop was
at the time.


128
0:5:36,5 --> 0:5:39,81
They were talking about starting
to do a video.


129
0:5:39,81 --> 0:5:42,86
And at the time there weren't a
lot of young guys-- like new


130
0:5:42,86 --> 0:5:44,11
ams on the team.


131
0:5:44,11 --> 0:5:46,48



132
0:5:46,48 --> 0:5:48,51
HEATH KIRCHART: I mean,
Greg was the main


133
0:5:48,51 --> 0:5:49,77
motivation behind that.


134
0:5:49,77 --> 0:5:51,3
He was really psyched
on Dylan.


135
0:5:51,3 --> 0:5:53,52
It was all Greg trying to--


136
0:5:53,52 --> 0:5:55,54
because Greg was working
on "Mind Field."


137
0:5:55,54 --> 0:5:57,56
And at the time, he was like,
well, the video needs these


138
0:5:57,56 --> 0:5:58,65
younger kids, and stuff.


139
0:5:58,65 --> 0:5:59,87
And I agreed with it,
and everything.


140
0:5:59,87 --> 0:6:0,63
And it did.


141
0:6:0,63 --> 0:6:2,46
And so Greg was the
main motivation to


142
0:6:2,46 --> 0:6:4,18
make the video better.


143
0:6:4,18 --> 0:6:8,29



144
0:6:8,29 --> 0:6:10,31
ANTHONY VAN ENGELEN: We were
starting the workshop video.


145
0:6:10,31 --> 0:6:12,392
I was living with Greg.


146
0:6:12,392 --> 0:6:17,97
It was 2000 fucking 6, or
the end of 5, I think.


147
0:6:17,97 --> 0:6:22,23
And I think we were kind of
riding out that lull of when


148
0:6:22,23 --> 0:6:24,34
Pappalardo had originally
quit.


149
0:6:24,34 --> 0:6:25,46
It was a slow start.


150
0:6:25,46 --> 0:6:29,51
And there was no real new
blood on the team.


151
0:6:29,51 --> 0:6:33,29
And we knew we needed that in
the video and just for the


152
0:6:33,29 --> 0:6:35,7
Workshop in general.


153
0:6:35,7 --> 0:6:36,26
I remember talking to Greg.


154
0:6:36,26 --> 0:6:40,49
And I was like, dude,
this kid--


155
0:6:40,49 --> 0:6:45,86
Omar and Dylan being
a ideal package.


156
0:6:45,86 --> 0:6:49,73
We were talking about both
of them at the same time.


157
0:6:49,73 --> 0:6:51,44
We needed to kind of jump
on these kids, you know?


158
0:6:51,44 --> 0:8:51,44
