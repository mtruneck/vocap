SHANE SMITH: Now, Beirut's a
huge, cosmopolitan city.


4
0:0:9,2 --> 0:0:10,55
It's got casinos.


5
0:0:10,55 --> 0:0:13,44
And it's got fancy swimming
clubs and all the big mansions


6
0:0:13,44 --> 0:0:14,96
going up into the hills.


7
0:0:14,96 --> 0:0:18,71
But the camps are totally
exempt from that.


8
0:0:18,71 --> 0:0:20,28
Ahmad was born in Lebanon.


9
0:0:20,28 --> 0:0:21,72
His dad was born in Lebanon.


10
0:0:21,72 --> 0:0:24,92
But they're not considered
Lebanese.


11
0:0:24,92 --> 0:0:28,2
360 degrees of their life
is consumed with


12
0:0:28,2 --> 0:0:30,3
living in the camps.


13
0:0:30,3 --> 0:0:33,23
But because he started making
films and getting noticed for


14
0:0:33,23 --> 0:0:37,2
making those films, he's been
able to get beyond the borders


15
0:0:37,2 --> 0:0:38,97
of the camp.


16
0:0:38,97 --> 0:0:42,23
He got invited to go up to the
mountains to a rich French


17
0:0:42,23 --> 0:0:45,79
boarding school and exchange
ideas and creativity with


18
0:0:45,79 --> 0:0:49,53
other young, budding
filmmakers.


19
0:0:49,53 --> 0:0:52,251
It's like France up here.


20
0:0:52,251 --> 0:0:52,702
It's nice.


21
0:0:52,702 --> 0:0:53,952
It's like French.


22
0:0:53,952 --> 0:0:56,31



23
0:0:56,31 --> 0:0:58,9
So I guess this is some
sort of humanitarian


24
0:0:58,9 --> 0:1:0,93
project that they give.


25
0:1:0,93 --> 0:1:5,446
Palestinians can come up to the
nice French high school


26
0:1:5,446 --> 0:1:8,26
and learn things.


27
0:1:8,26 --> 0:1:9,37
It's nice here.


28
0:1:9,37 --> 0:1:11,58
It's a lot nicer
than the camp.


29
0:1:11,58 --> 0:1:13,375
And you like coming up
to the mountains?


30
0:1:13,375 --> 0:1:13,82
AHMAD: Yeah.


31
0:1:13,82 --> 0:1:16,185
I like this area and
I like this place.


32
0:1:16,185 --> 0:1:18,46
SHANE SMITH: Yeah.


33
0:1:18,46 --> 0:1:19,9
AHMAD: We cannot be late.


34
0:1:19,9 --> 0:1:20,38
SHANE SMITH: OK.


35
0:1:20,38 --> 0:1:21,82
AHMAD: We have to go inside.


36
0:1:21,82 --> 0:1:25,155



37
0:1:25,155 --> 0:1:27,41
SHANE SMITH: During the year,
this is a boarding school for


38
0:1:27,41 --> 0:1:29,64
rich Lebanese families.


39
0:1:29,64 --> 0:1:33,19
In the summer, there's a program
for young Palestinian


40
0:1:33,19 --> 0:1:35,63
filmmakers to come up,
take a break from


41
0:1:35,63 --> 0:1:37,345
the camps, and learn.

SHANE SMITH: But even here,
the kids can't escape the


46
0:2:10,28 --> 0:2:13,25
political situations that
exist in the camps.


47
0:2:13,25 --> 0:2:15,94
This film workshop turned
into a political rally.

SHANE SMITH: You know, all these
kids from the camps get


51
0:2:25,953 --> 0:2:28,9
a sort of pass for the summer to
come up here into the rich


52
0:2:28,9 --> 0:2:30,2
neighborhood.


53
0:2:30,2 --> 0:2:32,642
It's really nice, it's clean,
it's beautiful.


54
0:2:32,642 --> 0:2:34,41
It reminds me of France.


55
0:2:34,41 --> 0:2:36,61
And then you come in in the
morning, and they're like, OK,


56
0:2:36,61 --> 0:2:39,38
welcome to the Black
Death Organization.

SHANE SMITH: Politics are
embedded into the Palestinian


61
0:2:55,1 --> 0:2:57,7
mindset at the basic level.


62
0:2:57,7 --> 0:2:58,81
You see it every day there.


63
0:2:58,81 --> 0:3:1,78
And you especially see it in
modern-day Palestinian cinema.

[MUSIC PLAYING]


65
0:3:13,53 --> 0:3:15,84
SHANE SMITH: What we found at
the film retreat is that even


66
0:3:15,84 --> 0:3:18,53
though Palestinians are
hyper-political and they do


67
0:3:18,53 --> 0:3:21,58
grow up surrounded by violence,
there is a group of


68
0:3:21,58 --> 0:3:24,46
Palestinian grassroots
filmmakers that are making


69
0:3:24,46 --> 0:3:28,49
really thought-provoking films
about their situation.


70
0:3:28,49 --> 0:3:30,12
Can you tell us where
we are right now?


71
0:3:30,12 --> 0:3:42,1



72
0:3:42,1 --> 0:3:43,6
SHANE SMITH: And you're
the coordinator

0:3:43,6 --> 0:3:44,685
for the whole event?


74
0:3:44,685 --> 0:3:46,12
SHANE SMITH: Wow.


75
0:3:46,12 --> 0:3:48,65

SHANE SMITH: And so how did the
other Palestinians get to


86
0:5:27,4 --> 0:5:31,3
Berlin that you interviewed
there?


87
0:5:31,3 --> 0:5:32,5

smuggle them.

SHANE SMITH: This story is kind
of weird for us to report


98
0:8:47,71 --> 0:8:49,42
on for a couple of reasons.


99
0:8:49,42 --> 0:8:51,41
One, because we're so close
to it and it's kind of


100
0:8:51,41 --> 0:8:53,65
personal for us.


101
0:8:53,65 --> 0:8:57,76
And also because what it shows
is that film has become woven


102
0:8:57,76 --> 0:8:59,23
into our culture.


103
0:8:59,23 --> 0:9:2,25
And these people with the
worst conditions, with


104
0:9:2,25 --> 0:9:6,87
nothing, yearn to tell their
stories by making films.


105
0:9:6,87 --> 0:9:9,35
And this gives us hope that our
film and future won't be


106
0:9:9,35 --> 0:9:13,23
dominated by vapid and vacant
escapist Hollywood cartoon


107
0:9:13,23 --> 0:9:14,33
franchises.


108
0:9:14,33 --> 0:9:17,405
And two, that maybe Palestinian
kids will see


109
0:9:17,405 --> 0:9:20,87
Ahmad and his friends' example
and drop their rocks and


110
0:9:20,87 --> 0:9:23,91
instead pick up cameras.
