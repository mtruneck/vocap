###0 PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU BRING A CONE FROM
###2 GYMNOSPERM IN FOR THIS WEEK'S LAB. IT IS IMPORTANT.
###7 AND SOME OF YOU WON'T COLLECT THE GYMNOSPERM'S CONE,
###10 BUT THAT IS OKAY. YOU ARE THINKING AND THAT IS THE
###12 MAIN POINT OF THE EXERCISE, IS TO GET THIS CONE
###14 BROUGHT INTO THE LAB.
###16 TODAY'S LECTURE, WHAT I WANT TO DO IS TO
###18 CONTINUE TO EXPLORE THE PRIMARY PLANT BODY AND TALK
###22 ABOUT THE CELLS AND THE TISSUES THAT MAKE UP THE
###24 PRIMARY PLANT BODY. MOST OF YOU THINK, GOSH, THIS IS
###27 REALLY GOING TO BE A DULL TOPIC BUT WHAT I WANT TO SAY
###30 AT THE OUTSET THAT MOST OF THE THESE CELLS AND TISSUES
###33 THAT WE TALK ABOUT TODAY, YOU HAVE, IF NOT DAILY
###36 
###39 WITH MOST OF THEM. AND SO, WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO IS
###42 SHOW YOU EXAMPLES THAT ARE RELEVANT TO YOUR DAILY
###44 LIVES AND AT THE SAME TIME INTRODUCE YOU TO THE
###47 DIFFERENT CELLS AND TISSUES THAT MAKE UP THE PLANT
###50 BODY. NOW, AFTER THE EMBRYO FORMS THE FORMATION OF
###56 NEW CELLS, AND TISSUES BECOMES RESTRICTED TO THE
###59 MERISTEMS. AFTER EMBRYO FORMATION NEW CELLS OR NEW
###72 CELL PRODUCTION, IS RESTRICTED MORE OR LESS TO THE
###78 MERISTEMS.
###87 WE SAID LAST TIME THAT A MERISTEM WAS A ZONE OF
###94 HIGH CELL DIVISION ACTIVITY. MERISTEMS ARE ZONES OF
###99 HIGH CELL DIVISION ACTIVITY AND THAT THERE WAS A SHOOT
###102 MERISTEM AND A ROOT MERISTEM.
###113 THESE CELLS, WHICH ARE ABLE TO DIVIDE, WHICH WE
###116 SAY ARE COMPRISING THE MERISTEM, BASICALLY WE BELIEVE
###122 COULD DIVIDE FOREVER. THEY, AS LONG AS THEY ARE NOT
###125 DAMAGED OR INFECTED BY SOME PATHOGEN, WE THINK THESE
###131 
###133 FAMILIAR WITH THE TERM "STEM CELLS" THIS IS STEM CELLS
###139 IN THE ANIMAL SENSE, STEM CELLS. MANY PEOPLE BELIEVE
###143 THAT MERISTEM STEM CELLS ARE EQUIVALENT TO ANIMAL STEM
###146 CELLS. THAT IS, THEY HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DIVIDE
###149 LITERALLY FOREVER. NOW, THE ACTIVITY OF THE MERISTEM
###154 YIELDS CELLS WHICH WE SAID WERE PRIMARY.
###169 THEY CAN TRACE THEIR ORIGIN
###176 TO THE MERISTEMS.
###180 THIS IS AN IMPORTANT POINT, CELLS WHICH CAN
###183 TRACE THEIR ORIGINS TO THE MERISTEM ARE SAID TO BE
###186 PRIMARY. AND, THESE CELLS TOGETHER FORM THE PRIMARY
###199 PLANT BODY.
###199 WE WILL TALK ABOUT THE PRIMARY PLANT BODY TODAY.
###207 MORE IMPORTANTLY, I WILL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF
###209 IT IN A MOMENT, MERISTEMS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE
###225 CELLS WHICH YIELD ELONGATION OF THE PLANT BODY.
###237 LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT I MEAN BY
###241 MERISTEM STEM CELLS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CELLS THAT
###245 
###248 LET'S HAVE AN AXIS HERE. WE CAN START WITH THIS
###251 AXIS AND THIS WILL BE THE SHOOT APICAL MERISTEM AT ONE
###257 END, AND THIS WILL BE THE ROOT APICAL MERISTEM AT THE
###262 OTHER END.
###264 AND FOR OUR DISCUSSION TODAY LET'S JUST PUT
###267 A REFERENCE POINT HERE, WE WILL CALL THIS A REFERENCE
###271 POINT. LET'S SAY WE PUT A MARK OF INK ON THE PLANT OR
###276 TIED SOMETHING AROUND THIS PORTION OF THE PLANT. NOW
###279 WE WILL WAIT FOR SOME TIME, AND NEW CELLS ARE GOING TO
###286 BE PRODUCED AT THE SHOOT APICAL MERISTEM AND THE ROOT
###289 APICAL MERISTEM. THIS WILL BE BY MITOSIS. IF WE
###293 WAITED FOR SOME TIME WE WOULD FIND THAT THE AXIS WAS
###296 NOW LONGER.
###301 HERE IS OUR REFERENCE POINT AGAIN, THE AXIS IS
###304 STILL LONGER.
###307 AND IF WE WAITED FOR SOME MORE TIME, THE AXIS
###311 WOULD BE EVEN LONGER WITH THE SHOOT APICAL MERISTEM
###315 
###319 POINT HERE.
###323 THIS IS KNOWN AS ELONGATION GROWTH.
###333 AND THIS ELONGATION GROWTH COMES ABOUT DUE TO
###336 THE ACTIVITIES OF CELLS THAT ARE PRODUCED BY THE
###341 APICAL MERISTEM AND THEN THEMSELVES ELONGATE. SO,
###345 WHEN A PLANT GROWS IN LENGTH, THAT IS A RESULT OF
###349 CELLS THAT HAVE BEEN PRODUCED AT THE TWO TIPS, THE
###352 APICAL MERISTEM AND THOSE CELLS THEMSELVES ELONGATE TO
###356 INCREASE THE LENGTH OF THE AXIS. THIS IS THE PRIMARY
###359 PLANT BODY AND IT IS IMPORTANT.
###362 NOW, WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO IS TO BEGIN WITH
###366 THE DISCUSSION OF THE VARIOUS CELL AND TISSUE TYPES
###369 WHICH MAKE UP THE PRIMARY PLANT BODY. AND FOR OUR
###372 DISCUSSION TODAY WE CAN DEFINE A TISSUE AS ONE OR MORE
###382 CELL TYPES DISTINGUISHED STRUCTURALLY OR FUNCTIONALLY
###401 OR WITH BOTH CHARACTERISTICS.
###411 I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN OUR DISCUSSION WITH THE
###414 
###420 AND THIS TISSUE TYPE IS CALLED PARENCHYMA.
###427 THIS IS BELIEVED TO BE THE FIRST CELL TYPE
###436 EVOLVED FROM WHICH ALL OF THE OTHER PLANT CELLS WERE
###441 DERIVED.
###455 NOW, LET'S BEGIN WITH SOME CHARACTERISTICS OF
###458 PARENCHYMA CELLS. THE FIRST CHARACTERISTIC, THIS IS
###461 IMPORTANT ONE, YOU WILL SEE THIS SHORTLY WHY THIS IS
###464 SO IMPORTANT, IS THAT THEY ARE ALIVE WHEN FUNCTIONAL.
###475 SECOND CHARACTERISTIC OF THE MANY, BUT I WILL
###478 CHOOSE 3 THAT ARE PROBABLY IMPORTANT FOR TODAY'S TALK,
###482 IS THAT THEY HAVE THIN WALLS. THIN WALLS. AND THIRD
###490 THAT THEY CAN BE STIMULATED TO DIVIDE.
###499 AND THIS STIMULATION TO DIVIDE OFTEN INVOLVES
###502 THEM IN REPAIRING WOUNDS.
###510 SO, IF YOU CUT INTO A PLANT AND YOU MAKE A WOUND
###512 OR A CAR BACKS INTO A TREE AND MAKES A GAUGE OR WOUND
###516 PARENCHYMA CELLS STIMULATE AND DIVIDE AND REPAIR THAT
###520 
###526 PARENCHYMA CELLS. THESE LIVING CELLS WITHIN CELL
###530 WALLS. FOR OUR PURPOSES THEY HAVE TWO MAIN FUNCTIONS,
###535 ALTHOUGH IN SPECIALIZED CASES THEY HAVE OTHER
###538 FUNCTIONS. THOSE TWO FUNCTIONS ARE:
###540 1. THEY FUNCTION IN PHOTOSYNTHESIS. THAT IS,
###551 PHOTOSYNTHESIS OCCURS IN PARENCHYMA CELLS AND SECONDLY
###562 THEY FUNCTION IN STORAGE.
###569 USUALLY THE COMPOUND WHICH
###571 IS STORED INSIDE OF THEM IS STARCH.
###578 MOST OF YOU HAVE HAD INTIMATE CONTACT OR
###582 INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE OF PARENCHYMA CELLS IN THE FORM OF
###584 A POTATO. IF WE COULD PEEL THIS POTATO ALL OF THE
###588 CELLS THAT ARE INSIDE THE POTATO, ALL OF THE
###591 STARCH-FILLED CELLS INSIDE OF THE POTATO ARE
###593 PARENCHYMA CELLS. THE POTATO IS BASICALLY MADE UP OF
###596 SIMPLE THIN WALLED CELLS WHICH FUNCTION TO STORE
###599 STARCH. THIS IS THE FIRST CELL TYPE WHICH WE BELIEVE
###605 IS THE TYPE FROM WHICH ALL OF THE OTHER CELLS IN THE
###608 
###613 CONSIDER THE SECOND CELL TYPE:
###619 AGAIN, ONE IN WHICH MANY OF YOU HAVE HAD CONTACT
###621 WITH WITHOUT REALIZING IT. IT IS CALLED COLLENCHYMA.
###625 IT HAS ALL OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF PARENCHYMA CELLS,
###628 THAT IT IS ALIVE. BUT IT HAS ONE STRUCTURAL
###633 DIFFERENCE. IT HAS VARIOUSLY THICKENED WALLS.
###645 VARIOUSLY THICKENED WALLS. AND AS A RESULT, AND I WILL
###648 SHOW YOU SOME PICTURES OF THESE THICK WALLS, IT
###650 FUNCTIONS IN SUPPORT.
###661 EXAMPLES OF COLLENCHYMA CELLS THAT I BELIEVE ALL
###663 OF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH ARE FOUND IN CELERY. IN
###666 CELERY, THIS STRUCTURE THAT WE EAT IS PART OF THE
###670 LEAF, PART OF THE PETIOLE. THE LEAF HAS BEEN CUT OFF.
###673 WE DON'T EAT THE LEAF BUT THE COLLENCHYMA CELLS ARE
###676 WHAT GIVE THIS PETIOLE ITS SUPPORT BUT MAKE IT RIGID
###680 AND UPRIGHT. IF YOU BREAK A CELERY AND HAVE THESE
###684 STRANDS, STRINGS THAT YOU PULL OFF THESE STRINGS ARE
###687 
###690 PETIOLE ITS SUPPORT, GIVE IT ITS RIGIDITY.
###693 COLLENCHYMA CAN OCCUR IN BUNDLES OR STRANDS OR THEY
###697 CAN OCCUR SEPARATELY. NOTICE THEY ARE AT THE
###700 PERIPHERY TOWARD THE OUTSIDE OF THE CELERY. IF YOU
###703 WERE AN ENGINEER THAT IS WHERE YOU WOULD WANT TO PLACE
###705 YOUR SUPPORT, IF YOU WERE DESIGNING A BUILDING. THIRD
###710 CELL TYPE, WHICH I WANT TO CONSIDER, IS ALSO DERIVED
###714 FROM THE PARENCHYMA. BUT, IT REALLY CONSISTS OF TWO
###720 CELL TYPES WHICH MAKE IT UP AND SO I AM GOING TO GIVE
###723 YOU A GENERALIZED NAME AND THEN CONSIDER THE TWO CELL
###726 TYPES WHICH MAKE IT UP. IT IS CALLED SCLERENCHYMA.
###732 SCLERENCHYMA DIFFERS FROM PARENCHYMA AND COLLENCHYMA
###739 BY, THE GIVE-AWAY IS THIS NAME. THE WORD SCLERENCHYMA
###743 COMES FROM THE GREEK WORD SKLIRA, WHICH MEANS HARD.
###748 SCLERENCHYMA CELLS HAVE IMBEDDED OR AS PART OF THE
###756 CELL WALL A HARD COMPOUND KNOWN AS LIGNIN, KNOWN AS
###770 LIGNIN. THIS GIVES THE WORDS SKLIRAS, AND MAKES THE
###775 
###786 ALSO IN PROTECTION. I WILL SHOW YOU THE, WHY WE THINK
###790 IT IS INVOLVED IN PROTECTION.
###791 THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF SCLERENCHYMA
###801 CELLS, BOTH OF WHICH YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH, ALTHOUGH
###804 PROBABLY THE NAME OF ONLY WHICH YOU WILL BE FAMILIAR
###806 WITH WHEN WE START THIS DISCUSSION. SCLERENCHYMA COMES
###810 IN TWO TYPES OF CELLS, THEY COME IN CELLS, WHICH YOU
###813 KNOW OF AS FIBERS. AND THE SECOND GROUP SCLEROID.
###822 LET'S FIRST TALK ABOUT FIBERS. FIBERS ARE ELONGATED
###827 CELLS, ELONGATED CELLS WITH OVERLAPPING END WALLS.
###840 SO, YOU CAN PRETEND LIKE THIS IS A FIBER, ONE FIBER.
###845 AND HERE WOULD BE A SECOND FIBER AND HERE WOULD BE THE
###849 OVERLAPPING END WALLS. THEY TEND TO OCCUR IN BUNDLES.
###859 AN EXAMPLE OF A PRODUCT MADE FROM FIBERS THAT
###863 MOST OF YOU AWARE OF IS ROPE. ROPE IS GRITTY AND
###869 TOUGH AND COARSE BECAUSE OF THE LIGNIN WHICH IS
###873 DEPOSITED IN THE FIBERS AND WHAT GIVES THE ROPE ITS
###876 
###881 INSTANCES THE FIBERS DON'T BECOME LIGNIFIED, THEY
###887 DON'T GET LIGNIN DEPOSITED INTO THEM UNTIL THE PLANT
###890 GETS QUITE OLD. IN THAT PARTICULAR SITUATION HUMANS
###894 HAVE EXPLOITED THIS SITUATION FOR MILLENNIA AND
###898 ILLUSTRATED BY THIS PLANT HERE. THIS IS THE PLANT
###901 WHICH IS KNOWN AS THE LINUM PLANT. WHICH IS WHERE
###906 VERY FINE LINEN COMES FROM. IN LINUM LIGNIN
###914 DEPOSITION IS DELAYED.
###922 THIS RESULTS IN THE PRODUCTION OF SO-CALLED SOFT
###926 FIBERS. THEY AREN'T HARD AND COARSE LIKE YOU WOULD
###931 FIND IN THE ROPE.
###933 THE FIBERS, AS I WILL SHOW YOU A PICTURE OF AND
###935 SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE ACTUALLY HAD EXPERIENCE WITH THIS
###938 OCCUR IN BUNDLES IN THIS LINUM PLANT. SINCE EARLY
###943 DAYS, SINCE BEFORE THE EGYPTIANS, THIS PLANT WAS GROWN
###946 AND THE FIBERS WERE COMBED OUT OF THIS PLANT ON VERY
###951 FINE TOOTH COMBS. THEY COME OUT IN BUNDLES AND THEY
###953 
###957 VERY FINE TABLE CLOTHS, SCARVES. THESE ARE WHAT ARE
###960 MADE OF FINE LINEN OR MADE FROM THE LINUM. EVENTUALLY
###965 THESE FIBERS WILL BECOME, HAVE LIGNIN IN THEM BUT NOT
###969 FOR A LONG TIME. NOT LIKE THE FIBERS THAT MAKE THE
###971 ROPE. NOW, HERE IS AN EXAMPLE WHERE FIBERS ARE
###975 ACTUALLY INVOLVED IN MAKING THE SHAPE OR SUPPORT OF
###979 A PARTICULAR, IN THIS CASE, IT IS A LOOFAH. SOME OF
###983 YOU KNOW WHAT LOOFAH SPONGES ARE. LOOFAH IS A MEMBERS
###988 OF THE SQUASH OR GOURD FAMILY WHAT IS DONE IS THAT THE
###993 ORGANIC MATERIAL WHICH CAN BE EASILY DIGESTED OR
###996 DEGRADED AWAY IS EITHER DEGRADED AWAY WITH ACID OR BY
###999 MICROBIAL ACTIVITIES, LEAVING BEHIND ESSENTIALLY THE
###1003 STRUCTURE OF THE GOURD, WHICH IS ALL FIBERS. THESE
###1007 FIBERS HAVE (INAUDIBLE) IN THEM FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO
###1010 HAVE USED IT. AND ARE USED FOR WASHING YOURSELF IN
###1013 THE BATHROOM. SO THIS PARTICULAR GOURD AND MANY OTHER
###1018 FRUITS THAT WE WILL TALK ABOUT HAVE THEIR SHAPE AS
###1020 
###1023 IS THE FIBER MESH NETWORK THAT GIVES THIS GOURD ITS
###1026 SHAPE. SO THESE ARE FIBERS, COMMERCIALLY EXTREMELY
###1031 IMPORTANT THEY ARE USED BY US ON A DAILY BASIS.
###1037 SECOND GROUP OR TYPE OF CELLS WHICH MAKE UP THE
###1040 SCLERENCHYMA IS LESS FAMILIAR TO MOST OF YOU, BUT I
###1044 GUARANTEE MOST OF YOU HAVE USED THESE IN MANY WAYS.
###1047 THESE ARE THE SCLEROIDS. THESE TEND TO FUNCTION IN
###1050 PROTECTION. ALTHOUGH NOT ALWAYS. WE ARE NOT QUITE SURE
###1054 SOMETIMES WHY THEY FUNCTION. THEY TEND TO BE SHORT,
###1058 ROUND, SOMETIMES, AND SOMETIMES EVEN POINTED CELLS.
###1065 SHORT, ROUND, POINTED CELLS.
###1070 THEY HAVE VERY THICK WALLS.
###1081 AND SOME EXAMPLES
###1082 OF WHERE SCLEROIDS ARE USED, ARE FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE
###1086 SHELL OF WALNUTS. THE REASON THE SHELL IS SO HARD IS
###1090 BECAUSE IT HAS SCLEROIDS OR THE CELLS WHICH ARE PART
###1095 OF THE SHELL WALL HAVE SCLEROIDS IN THEM. AND IT
###1098 MAKES THIS PROTECT THE DEVELOPING EMBRYO ON THE
###1101 
###1102 SOME MORE COMMON USES OF SCLEROIDS THAT YOU MAY
###1105 OF ARE IN PEARS. WHEN YOU EAT PEARS THE GRITTY NATURE
###1110 OF THE PEAR IS THE RESULT OF SCLEROIDS. THESE STONE
###1114 CELLS THAT ARE LOCATED IN THE PEAR AND GIVE IT ITS
###1116 GRITTY TEXTURE. SOMETIMES THIS GRITTINESS MAY TURN OUT
###1120 TO BE SOMETHING WE EXPECT. FOR EXAMPLE, FIG NEWTONS,
###1125 WHEN YOU EAT FIG NEWTONS AND YOU GET A LITTLE GRITTY
###1127 NATURE YOU ARE ACTUALLY CHOMPING ON SOME SCLEROID THAT
###1130 ARE IN THE SEED OR THE FRUIT OF THE SMALL FIG. AT ONE
###1135 TIME THEY DISCOVERED A FIG WHICH DIDN'T HAVE SCLEROIDS
###1137 AND THEY TRIED TO MAKE FIG NEWTONS OUT OF IT AND
###1139 PEOPLE WOULDN'T BUY IT. BECAUSE THEY EXPECTED FIG
###1143 NEWTONS TO HAVE A GRITTY NATURE. NOW WHY HAVE THESE
###1146 SCLEROIDS? WE THINK THAT THE SCLEROIDS WHAT THEY
###1149 PROBABLY DO ARE USED TO RETARD INSECTS FROM, NOT IN
###1154 THE CASE OF THE WALNUT, BUT IN THE CASE OF THE FIG
###1156 NEWTON OR THE PEAR TO RETARD INSECTS FROM EATING THESE
###1159 
###1162 INSECT AND YOU HAD MANDIBLES, IF YOU BIT INTO
###1164 SOMETHING LIKE THIS AND YOU ENCOUNTER ONE OF THESE
###1167 STONE CELLS IS MIGHT RETARD YOU OR SLOW YOU DOWN FROM
###1171 GETTING INTO THE FRUIT. WE THINK THEY HAVE A FUNCTION
###1174 WITH REGARD TO THESE PARTICULAR TYPES OF PROTECTIVE
###1180 MECHANISMS.
###1182 LET ME SHOW YOU A FEW SLIDES, IF WE CAN GET THIS
###1184 TO GO FOR US, A FEW SLIDES OF SOME OF THESE.
###1197 OKAY, FIRST SLIDE IS MEANT TO SHOW YOU, TO
###1199 REMIND YOU OF THE APICAL MERISTEM LOCATIONS WHERE
###1204 PRIMARY GROWTH IS PRODUCED. EVERY BRANCH, AXIS WHICH
###1208 GROWS IN LENGTH HAS APICAL MERISTEM AT ITS TIP. ALL
###1212 OF THE ROOTS, WHICH ARE GROWING IN LENGTH, THE MAIN
###1215 TIP OF THE ROOT, WHICH IS GROWING IN LENGTH. ALL OF
###1216 THEM HAVE APICAL MERISTEM. AND THIS IS AN IMPORTANT
###1219 POINT THAT YOU HAVE TO REALIZE. ALL THINGS THAT GROW
###1222 IN LENGTH HAVE TO HAVE A APICAL MERISTEM. HERE ARE
###1225 
###1227 RELATIVELY THIN-WALLED. THEY ARE ALIVE AND APPEAR TO
###1231 BE EMPTY. HERE ARE PARENCHYMA CELLS WHICH CONTAIN
###1234 STARCH. THEY ARE COMPLETELY PACKED WITH STARCH AS YOU
###1237 FIND IN POTATO. THESE DARK, SORT OF STAINED BODIES ARE
###1240 STARCH. NEXT SLIDE SHOWS YOU SOME COLLENCHYMA. WE
###1243 ARE LOOKING DOWN ON A COLLENCHYMA CELL. IN THESE
###1246 PARTICULAR COLLENCHYMA CELLS THEY PUT THICKENING OF
###1248 THE CELL WALLS ONLY IN THE CORNERS, NOT IN BETWEEN.
###1252 THIS IS AN INTERESTING EXAMPLE. HERE WE CAN HAVE
###1255 SHEATHS OF COLLENCHYMA. THIS IS A STEM WHICH HAS BEEN
###1257 CUT ACROSS AT SECTION AND HERE ARE SHEATHS OF
###1260 COLLENCHYMA, WHICH I WILL SHOW YOU IN A HIGHER POWER.
###1263 HERE YOU CAN SEE THICKENED CELL WALLS, AGAIN AS YOU
###1266 WOULD FIND IN THE CELERY WHICH WE BELIEVE PROVIDES
###1269 SUPPORT.
###1270 HERE ARE FIBER. THIS IS A CROSS SECTION, CUT
###1273 ACROSS THE STEM OF THIS PLANT WHICH IS UP HERE IN
###1275 
###1278 THIS IS STAIN OR A DYE WHICH HAS BEEN PUT ON, BUT I
###1281 WANT TO CALL YOUR ATTENTION TO THE BUNDLES OF FIBERS
###1284 WHICH ARE LOCATED TOWARDS THE OUTSIDE. HUGE NUMBER OF
###1288 FIBERS, IF WE LOOK AT THE FIBERS A LITTLE HIGHER
###1291 POWERED HERE, YOU CAN SEE, THERE ARE TREMENDOUS
###1294 FIBERS, THEY HAVE A VERY SMALL INSIDE CYTOPLASM AND
###1297 VERY THICK WALLS. IN THIS CASE THEY ARE SOFT FIBERS.
###1301 HERE ARE SOME SCLEROIDS NOW, WHICH WE BELIEVE FUNCTION
###1304 TO PROTECT PLANTS FROM INSECTS AND OTHER SMALL
###1306 ANIMALS. YOU CAN SEE THESE CELLS ARE, THEY HAVE LOTS
###1310 OF POINTS ON THEM AND THESE POINTS WE THINK, THIS IS A
###1312 CAMELLIA LEAF, THESE POINTS WE THINK ARE PROBABLY WHAT
###1316 KEEPS ANIMALS FROM EATING IT. HERE IS A SCLEROID
###1318 FOUND IN A WATER PLANT, A WATER PLANT, THE LEAF
###1321 PROBABLY TO RETARD ANIMALS IN THE WATER FROM EATING
###1324 THE LEAF. HERE ARE THE SCLEROIDS THAT YOU WOULD FIND
###1327 IN THE PIT OF A PEACH. IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE, THE
###1332 
###1337 A VERY, DIFFICULT FOR US TO BITE INTO AND OF COURSE IT
###1341 WOULD BE FOR AN ANIMAL AS WELL. THE SEED WOULD BE
###1343 PROTECTED.
###1347 THESE ARE THEN THE FIRST GROUP OF CELLS, THE
###1350 PARENCHYMA, THE COLLENCHYMA AND THE SCLERENCHYMA.
###1353 THEY ARE MORE OR LESS SIMPLE CELL TYPES. NOW WHAT I
###1357 WOULD LIKE TO DO IS BEGIN A DISCUSSION OF OUR FIRST
###1360 TISSUE. OUR FIRST TISSUE. AND THIS TISSUE CONSISTS
###1364 OF A LARGE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT CELL TYPES AND THIS
###1367 FIRST TISSUE IS THE VASCULAR TISSUE. THE VASCULAR
###1374 TISSUE IS INVOLVED WITH TRANSPORT. INVOLVED WITH
###1383 TRANSPORT. AND THE VASCULAR TISSUE CONSISTS OF TWO
###1387 DIFFERENT CELL OR TISSUE TYPES, AND WE ARE GOING TO
###1389 SPEND TIME FIRST CELL TYPE IS KNOWN AS XYLEM. AND
###1396 THIS IS INVOLVED MAINLY WITH WATER TRANSPORT.
###1406 AND THE SECOND CELL TYPE IS PHLOEM. THIS IS
###1411 MAINLY INVOLVED WITH TRANSPORT OF NUTRIENTS.
###1435 THE FIRST THING I WANT TO SAY, WHICH IS CENTRAL
###1438 TO OUR DISCUSSION OF HOW THE XYLEM WORKS, IS THAT
###1440 THESE CELLS ARE DEAD WHEN FUNCTIONAL.
###1445 WE WILL EXPLORE THIS STATEMENT A LITTLE MORE IN
###1450 A MOMENT.
###1452 THERE ARE TWO CELL TYPES WHICH ARE THE MAIN
###1455 TRANSPORT TYPES IN XYLEM AND I WANT TO GIVE YOU THEIR
###1457 NAMES. THEY ARE KNOWN AS TRACHEIDS OR TRACHEARY
###1464 ELEMENTS. YOU WILL SEE IT REFERRED TO IN BOTH WAYS IN
###1470 YOUR BOOK OR -- THE SECOND CELL TYPE IS KNOWN AS
###1477 VESSEL ELEMENTS OR VESSEL MEMBERS.
###1489 NOW WHAT I WANT TO
###1489 SAY TO YOU ABOUT THESE TWO CELL TYPES, IN GYMNOSPERMS
###1498 WE ONLY FIND TRACHEIDS.
###1506 WHEREAS, IN ANGIOSPERMS,
###1513 BOTH TRACHEIDS AND
###1515 VESSEL ELEMENTS ARE INVOLVED IN WATER TRANSPORT.
###1534 THIS IS PROBABLY AN EVOLUTIONARY CHANGE. WHEN
###1540 WE EVOLVED UP TO ANGIOSPERM WE DEVELOPED AN ADDITIONAL
###1545 
###1550 WAS THE VESSEL ELEMENT. LET'S LOOK FIRST AT A
###1553 TRACHEID. A TRACHEID IS GENERALLY A THIN CELL.
###1558 A THIN CELL, TRACHEID, WITH OVERLAPPING END WALLS.
###1574 THIS IS CONTRASTED WITH A VESSEL ELEMENT.
###1578 VESSEL ELEMENT, WHICH I WILL ABBREVIATE AS, VE,
###1582 VESSEL ELEMENTS. VESSEL ELEMENTS ARE WIDE AND SHORT
###1587 OR SHORTER. LET'S NOW DRAW A VESSEL ELEMENT. HERE IS
###1593 ONE VESSEL ELEMENT, ONE VESSEL ELEMENT HERE.
###1599 NOW WATER TRANSPORT OCCURS BECAUSE VESSEL
###1603 ELEMENTS ARE CONNECTED TOGETHER.
###1605 SO, THIS IS ONE VESSEL ELEMENT. HERE WOULD BE
###1608 A SECOND VESSEL ELEMENT AND HERE WOULD BE A THIRD
###1613 VESSEL ELEMENT.
###1614 3 VESSEL ELEMENT CELLS CONNECTED TOGETHER.
###1618 THIS WHOLE STRUCTURE IS CALLED A VESSEL.
###1622 WHOLE STRUCTURE IS CALLED A VESSEL. HOW DOES
###1627 A VESSEL ELEMENT FORM AND WHERE DO WE GET THE VESSEL
###1631 
###1638 INDIVIDUAL LIVING XYLEM.
###1644 INDIVIDUAL LIVING XYLEM. AND THEN WE HAVE
###1647 A TERM THAT MOST OF YOU HAVE HEARD ABOUT BEFORE, WE
###1649 HAVE PROGRAM CELL DEATH.
###1658 ALL OF THE CYTOPLASM
###1660 DISAPPEARS IN THE CELLS AND THE END WALLS DISSOLVE TO
###1670 MAKE THIS VESSEL.
###1671 SO BASICALLY, YOU HAVE A TUBE, YOU HAVE A PIPE,
###1678 A WHOLE PIPE RUNNING THROUGH OR SERIES OF PIPES
###1681 RUNNING THROUGH THE PLANT AND YOU ACTUALLY CAN TAKE
###1685 A STEM OF A PLANT, WHICH HAS LOTS OF VESSELS, FOR
###1687 THOSE OF YOU SITTING UP HERE IN THE FRONT, I WILL BLOW
###1689 INTO THIS END AND MY BREATH WILL TRAVEL DOWN THROUGH
###1694 THE EMPTY VESSELS, WHICH ARE DEAD, AND YOU SHOULD BE
###1696 ABLE TO SEE BUBBLES EMERGE FROM THE BASE THERE.
###1699 FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE THERE. YOU COULD USE
###1702 IT AS A STRAW BUT YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO SEE IT. SO,
###1705 THIS IS A VESSEL. AND VESSELS CONDUCT WATER AND THEY
###1709 
###1717 OTHER CELL TYPE, WHICH MAKES UP THE VASCULAR TISSUE,
###1721 NAMELY THE PHLOEM. THE PHLOEM, THE PHLOEM CONSISTS OF
###1731 A CELL TYPE NOT LIKE THE TRACHEID VESSEL, BUT IS A
###1736 DIFFERENT CELL TYPE. THE PHLOEM CELL TYPE
###1742 TRANSPORTING NUTRIENTS IS CALLED A SIEVE ELEMENT.
###1749 WHICH WE WILL ABBREVIATE, SE.
###1760 NOW WHAT IS A SIEVE ELEMENT AND WHERE DID WE GET
###1763 THIS NAME FROM?
###1768 LIKE THE VESSEL ELEMENTS, THE SIEVE ELEMENTS ARE
###1772 CONNECTED IN A ROW.
###1773 EACH OF THESE IS A SIEVE ELEMENT.
###1784 WHERE DOES THE NAME SIEVE COME FROM? I WOULD
###1787 LIKE ALL OF YOU TO WATCH WHAT I AM GOING TO DO HERE
###1789 BECAUSE THIS WILL EXPLAIN TO YOU. IF WE PRETENDED
###1791 LIKE THIS ERASER WAS ONE OF THESE SIEVE ELEMENTS, LIKE
###1794 SO I AM GOING TO TAKE THIS ERASER AND TURN IT SO YOU
###1799 CAN LOOK AT THIS END WALL OF THE SIEVE ELEMENT. IF
###1802 
###1805 HERE, AND ON, YOU WOULD FIND A ROUND PLATE WITH PORES
###1811 IN IT.
###1812 THIS IS CALLED THE SIEVE PLATE. IT LOOKS LIKE
###1814 A SIEVE. THIS IS THE BASIS FOR THE NAME SIEVE
###1820 ELEMENTS.
###1821 HOW DOES THIS SIEVE ELEMENT FORM?
###1824 WELL THE VERY FIRST THING WE HAVE TO SAY IS
###1828 UNLIKE THE XYLEM, WHICH IS DEAD WHEN FUNCTIONAL, THE
###1832 PHLOEM IS ALIVE WHEN FUNCTIONAL. ALIVE WHEN
###1837 FUNCTIONAL.
###1839 THIS CREATES SOME PROBLEMS. IF THESE CELLS ARE
###1845 ALIVE WHEN FUNCTIONAL THAT MEANS THEY HAVE CYTOPLASM
###1848 AND NUCLEUS AND ALL THEIR ORGANELLES, HOW WILL THEY BE
###1852 ABLE TO TRANSPORT LOTS OF NUTRIENTS FROM ONE END OF
###1855 THE PLANT TO THE OTHER? WOULDN'T THAT GET ALL MIXED
###1857 UP WITH THE CYTOPLASM. WOULDN'T THE CYTOPLASM KIND OF
###1860 CLOG IT UP AND PREVENT VERY EFFICIENT TRANSPORT? IN
###1863 
###1867 THOUGH IT IS STILL ALIVE, I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT
###1869 ITS ORIGIN, AND YOU WILL GET A FEELING FOR THAT. HERE
###1873 IS THE SIEVE ELEMENT, MOTHER CELL. WITH TIME, AND IT
###1881 HAS A NUCLEUS IN IT, WITH TIME, WE GET A DIVISION OF
###1889 THE SIEVE ELEMENT MOTHER CELL.
###1891 BUT, IT IS NOT AN EQUAL DIVISION. IT IS UNEQUAL
###1894 DIVISION. A DIVISION. AND THEN WE HAVE A NUCLEUS
###1900 HERE, TOO.
###1902 THESE TWO CELLS ARE GIVEN SPECIAL NAMES. THIS
###1905 IS CALLED THE COMPANION CELL. THIS WILL BE THE NEW
###1912 SIEVE ELEMENT.
###1913 BUT SOMETHING HAPPENS BECAUSE WE TALKED ABOUT
###1922 THE PROBLEM OF HAVING IT CLOGGED UP. SOMETHING
###1925 HAPPENED. IN THE FORMATION OF THE SIEVE ELEMENT, WHAT
###1931 WE HAVE HAPPENING IS THAT THE NUCLEUS NOW OF THE SIEVE
###1937 ELEMENT AND OTHER ORGANELLES BEGIN TO DEGENERATE. SO
###1940 WITH TIME WE GET DEGENERATION OF THE SIEVE ELEMENT
###1950 
###1957 SO, WE WIND UP WITH TWO CELLS, THE COMPANION
###1962 CELL AND THE SIEVE ELEMENT NOW. HERE IS THE COMPANION
###1967 CELL, AND HERE IS THE SIEVE ELEMENT. AND ITS NUCLEUS
###1972 IS GONE. MOST OF ITS ORGANELLES ARE GONE. BUT IT IS
###1976 STILL ALIVE.
###1981 NOW, HOW CAN SOMETHING STAY ALIVE IF IT DOESN'T
###1983 HAVE A NUCLEUS TO CODE FOR NEW PROTEINS TO REPAIR OR
###1988 CODE FOR OTHER PROTEINS TO WORK ON THE FUNCTION?
###1991 THIS IS WHERE THE REAL KIND OF REMARKABLE LESSON COMES
###1995 IN. THOSE ACTIVITIES WHICH NO LONGER CAN BE CODED FOR
###2000 BUT WHICH ARE NECESSARY FOR THE SIEVE ELEMENT CELL TO
###2003 REMAIN ALIVE, THOSE ACTIVITIES ARE TAKEN OVER BY THE
###2007 NUCLEUS OF THE COMPANION CELL. THE COMPANION CELL
###2010 ENCODES FOR MANY OF THE ACTIVITIES THAT WOULD HAVE
###2013 GONE ON IN THE NUCLEUS OF THE SIEVE ELEMENT. WHEN THE
###2017 COMPANION CELL DIES, THE SIEVE ELEMENT DIES AS WELL.
###2023 LET ME NOW SHOW YOU SOME PICTURES OF THE VARIOUS
###2028 WE WILL
###2029 BEGIN WITH THE XYLEM AND I WANT TO AGAIN SHOW YOU THE
###2032 XYLEM CONSISTS OF, IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE, TRACHEIDS,
###2036 WHICH WE SAID ARE ELONGATED CELLS, RELATIVELY NARROW
###2039 AS COMPARED TO VESSEL ELEMENTS OR VESSEL MEMBERS WHICH
###2042 ARE SHORTER CELLS, RELATIVELY WIDER. POINT WHICH I
###2046 DIDN'T MAKE BUT YOU CAN SEE IN THE PICTURES IS THAT
###2049 END WALL OF THE VESSEL ELEMENT IS OPEN. THE VESSEL
###2052 ELEMENT IS OPEN. THERE IS NO OPENING ON THE TRACHEID
###2057 ELEMENTS BUT COMMUNICATION OCCURS THROUGH SMALLER
###2060 HOLES WHICH ARE KNOWN AS PITS. IF WE LOOK AT HOW
###2064 VESSEL FORMS, AGAIN WE HAVE A LIVING SERIES OF XYLEM
###2068 CELLS WHICH IN TIME ELONGATE AND THEN THE NUCLEUS AND
###2073 CYTOPLASM UNDERGO PROGRAM CELL DEATH AND THE END WALL
###2076 BEGINS TO DISSOLVE AWAY BEFORE THE CELL COMPLETELY
###2079 DIED UNTIL WE PRODUCE THIS TUBE, THIS TUBE WHICH
###2082 REPRESENTS THE VESSEL.
###2085 THE NEXT SLIDE WILL SHOW YOU SCANNING
###2089 TWO VESSEL
###2090 ELEMENTS ARE MEETING. THIS WOULD BE THE POINT WHERE
###2092 THE TWO MEET AND IT IS AN OPEN PORE WHICH ALLOWS WATER
###2096 TO MOVE AT VERY HIGH VELOCITIES THROUGH THE VESSEL.
###2099 HERE IS A VESSEL ELEMENT, WHICH HAS BEEN DISSECTED
###2102 OUT, YOU CAN SEE IT HAS ROUND AND THIS WOULD BE THE
###2105 OPENING IN ITS WALLS. THERE ALSO CAN BE COMMUNICATION
###2108 BETWEEN TRACHEIDS AND VESSEL ELEMENTS THROUGH
###2111 SIDEWALLS, THROUGH PITS, WHICH WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT.
###2113 NOW, HERE IS A SIEVE ELEMENT AND A COMPANION CELL
###2117 SHOWN ON ELECTROMICROGRAPH. FIRST THING TO POINT OUT
###2120 IS THAT THIS IS THE SIEVE ELEMENT AND THE SIEVE PLATE
###2124 IS LOCATED HERE, HERE IS ANOTHER SIEVE ELEMENT HERE.
###2128 SO, WHEN WE HAVE A GROUP OF SIEVE ELEMENTS ALL HOOKED
###2133 UP TOGETHER WE CALL THIS A SIEVE TUBE. A SIEVE TUBE.
###2136 WHEN ALL SIEVE ELEMENTS ARE HOOKED UP TOGETHER. NOW
###2140 WHAT I WANT YOU TO NOTICE FROM THIS ONE IS THERE IS
###2142 DENSELY CYTOPLASMIC CELL NEXT TO IT. THIS IS THE
###2145 
###2149 WHICH HAS HIGH LEVELS OF CYTOPLASM, THAT THE SIEVE
###2152 TUBE MEMBER IS RELATIVELY EMPTY, AS FAR AS HAVING
###2156 CONTENTS, BUT IT IS STILL ALIVE. IT STILL HAS ITS
###2158 MEMBRANES. NOW IF WE PUT OUR EYE AT THIS END AND LOOK
###2163 AT THE SIEVE PLATE, WE SEE THE SIEVE PLATE HERE. THIS
###2166 IS WHAT YOU WOULD LOOK AT. THERE WOULD BE ONE SIEVE
###2168 ELEMENT GOING INTO THE AUDIENCE AND ANOTHER ONE BEHIND
###2171 THE BOARD. AND I WANTED TO SHOW YOU A SIEVE UNDER
###2174 ELECTRON MICROSCOPE. THIS MAY NOT BE A TRUE PICTURE,
###2177 BUT THERE ARE PORES, THESE ARE THE DIFFERENT PORES IN
###2180 THE SIEVE PLATE. JUST TO SHOW YOU THE SERIES IN THE
###2184 PRODUCTION OF THE SIEVE ELEMENT, WHICH MAKES SIEVE
###2187 TUBE. HERE IS A MATURE SIEVE TUBE WHERE WE HAVE THE
###2191 SIEVE PLATES OF THE INDIVIDUAL SIEVE ELEMENTS. HERE
###2193 WOULD BE COMPANION CELL NEXT TO THE SIEVE ELEMENT. IF
###2197 WE FOLLOW ITS PRODUCTION WE START OUT WITH A MOTHER
###2200 CELL WHICH UNDERGOES AN ASYMMETRIC DIVISION, AND THAT
###2203 
###2206 COMPANION CELL AND A CELL WHICH WILL BECOME THE
###2209 SIEVE-TWO MEMBER. ITS NUCLEUS WILL BEGIN TO DEGRADE
###2213 AND MOST OF THE CYTOPLASM WILL BEGIN TO DEGRADE AND
###2215 SOMETIMES THE COMPANION CELLS DIVIDE AGAIN. BUT THE
###2218 POINT IS, THAT THERE IS NO LONGER ANY NUCLEUS IN THE
###2221 SIEVE-TWO, BUT IT IS STILL ALIVE.
###2225 THESE ARE THE ELEMENT WHICH MAKE UP THE VASCULAR
###2228 TISSUE. FINALLY, BEFORE I LEAVE TALKING ABOUT THE
###2232 CELL TYPES OF THE PRIMARY PLANT BODY, I WANT TO
###2235 INTRODUCE YOU TO THE LAST CELL TYPE. AGAIN WHICH MOST
###2238 OF YOU HAVE HAD CONTACT WITH. THAT LAST CELL TYPE WE
###2243 WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS THE EPIDERMIS. THE EPIDERMIS IS
###2249 OUTER-MOST LAYER OF THE PLANT.
###2257 OF THE PRIMARY PLANT BODY.
###2265 AS A CONSEQUENCE, IT'S THE FIRST LAYER TO
###2268 ENCOUNTER ALL THE DIFFICULTIES WITH THE EXTERNAL
###2270 ENVIRONMENT; POLLUTION, ATTACK BY DISEASE, ATTACK BY
###2274 
###2279 EPIDERMIS ENCOUNTERS FIRST. EPIDERMAL CELLS ARE
###2282 DIFFERENT FROM ALL OTHER CELLS IN THE PLANT, BECAUSE
###2284 THEY ARE NOT SURROUNDED ON ALL SIDES BY CELLS. ONLY
###2287 ON THEIR SIDE AND BOTTOM ARE THEY SURROUNDED BY THE
###2290 CELLS. BUT, ON ONE SURFACE THEY ARE COMPLETELY
###2293 EXPOSED TO THE OUTSIDE. SO THEY DIFFER FROM OTHER
###2297 CELLS IN THE PLANT. NOW, BECAUSE THEY REPRESENT THE
###2300 LAYER OF PROTECTION FOR THE PLANT
###2307 THEY DEVELOPED
###2308 A NUMBER OF CHARACTERISTICS WHICH ALLOW THEM TO RESIST
###2311 THE ENVIRONMENTAL INSULTS WHICH ALLOW THEM TO RETARD
###2314 SOME INSECT AND ANIMAL ATTACKS AND ALSO PERDATION BY
###2318 VARIOUS DISEASES. THE FIRST WAY IN WHICH EPIDERMAL
###2323 CELLS RESIST IN ALLOWING PATHOGENS OR POLLUTANTS TO
###2327 ENTER INTO THE PLANT IS THAT THE CELLS OF THE
###2331 EPIDERMIS ARE VERY TIGHTLY JOINED TO EACH OTHER.
###2343 SO IF YOU COULD LOOK AT AN EPIDERMAL CELL, IT
###2349 ALMOST LOOKS LIKE A PUZZLE. WHERE YOU WOULD HAVE
###2352 
###2357 NO SPACES BETWEEN THE CELLS. SO THEY HAVE TIGHT
###2361 JUNCTIONS. THE SECOND WAY IN WHICH EPIDERMAL CELLS
###2364 OFFER PROTECTION IS ILLUSTRATED BY THIS APPLE.
###2368 THIS APPLE HAS AN EPIDERMIS ON IT AND THOSE OF
###2372 YOU WHO HAD TEACHERS WHO YOU WERE TRYING TO IMPRESS
###2374 WHEN YOU WERE KIDS YOU USED TO BRING AN APPLE, PERHAPS
###2376 INTO THE TEACHER. BEFORE YOU BROUGHT IT IN YOU RUBBED
###2378 IT AGAINST YOUR SHIRT. THE APPLE BECAME SHINY. THE
###2382 REASON THE APPLE BECAME SHINY IS BECAUSE THERE ARE
###2384 WAXES SECRETED TO THE OUTSIDE. SO, THE EPIDERMIS ALSO
###2388 SECRETES WAXES.
###2395 THESE WAXES MAKE UP A LAYER OR A THICK LAYER IN
###2399 SOME CASES KNOWN AS THE CUTICLE.
###2402 THE CUTICLE.
###2403 WHAT DOES THE CUTICLE DO? IT PREVENTS WATER
###2412 LOSS. PREVENTS WATER LOSS FROM THE INSIDE.
###2418 SO, YOU HAVE A LAYER OF WAX SURROUNDING THAT
###2424 A LOT
###2424 LONGER, BE AVAILABLE A LOT LONGER FOR SOME ANIMAL TO
###2428 DISPERSE THIS FRUIT, BUT IT WILL BE ATTRACTED TO THIS
###2431 FRUIT BECAUSE IT STILL RETAINS ITS TASTE AND ITS
###2433 FLAVOR BECAUSE OF THE CUTICLE. ALL PLANT PARTS, NOT
###2437 THE ROOT SYSTEM, BUT ALL ABOVE GROUND PARTS GENERALLY
###2439 HAVE SOME CUTICLE, SOME WAX SECRETED ON THE OUTSIDE TO
###2443 RETARD WATER LOSS. NOW, LET'S PRETEND LIKE THIS
###2446 BLACKBOARD IS A LEAF. YOU ARE LOOKING DOWN AT THIS
###2450 LEAF. IT IS COVERED WITH CUTICLE. THE PROBLEM THAT
###2453 YOU ALL KNOW ABOUT IS THAT THE LEAF IS ALSO THE SITE
###2456 OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS. AS A RESULT OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS, WE
###2460 ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE ABLE TO GET CO2 INTO A LEAF.
###2464 HOW DO WE GET CO2 INTO A LEAF, WHICH IS COVERED BY
###2468 A CUTICLE, WHICH IS COVERED BY A LAYER, WHICH PREVENTS
###2471 OR SLOWS DOWN THE MOVEMENT OF GASSES AND WATER? SO
###2476 IF THIS WERE A LEAF, THE WAY THE LEAF DEALS WITH THIS
###2479 PROBLEM, IS IT MAKES PORES. MAKES PORES.
###2489 KNOWN
###2489 AS STOMA.
###2491 MAKES PORES OR STOMA.
###2495 AND THROUGH THESE PORES CO2 CAN GO IN. THIS IS
###2501 A LEAF WE ARE LOOKING ON, A LEAF SURFACE. IT MAKES
###2505 PORES OR HOLES IN THE CUTICLE. THROUGH THESE PORES
###2508 CO2 CAN GO IN. THERE IS A PROBLEM BECAUSE AT THE SAME
###2512 TIME CO2 GOES IN THE THING THAT THE CUTICLE IS TRYING
###2516 TO PREVENT IS ALSO HAPPENING. WATER IS GOING OUT.
###2522 WATER IS GOING OUT.
###2523 SO HOW DOES THE PLANT DEAL WITH THIS SITUATION
###2530 THAT IT WANTS CO2 BUT IT DOESN'T WANT TO LOSE WATER?
###2534 THIS IS AN IMPORTANT CELL TYPE WHICH DEVELOPS IN THE
###2537 EPIDERMIS. THIS PARTICULAR PORE, WE WILL MAKE ANOTHER
###2541 ONE OVER HERE, THIS PARTICULAR PORE, DEVELOPS AROUND
###2547 IT, SPECIAL CELLS. WHICH ARE KNOWN AS GUARD CELLS.
###2557 THESE GUARD CELLS CONTROL THE SIZE OF THE PORE.
###2562 WE WILL TALK MORE ABOUT HOW THE GUARD CELLS WORK LATER
###2568 
###2570 OF THE EPIDERMIS. SO, WE HAVE TWO GUARD CELLS, WE
###2579 HAVE THE PORE, AND TOGETHER THIS WHOLE STRUCTURE IS
###2584 CALLED VARIOUS THINGS BUT THE SIMPLE NAME IS
###2589 A STOMATA. S-T-O-M-A-T-A, STOMATA. OR STOMATA
###2592 COMPLEX, DEPENDS ON HOW YOUR BOOK REFERS TO IT. THESE
###2595 ARE MODIFICATIONS OF EPIDERMAL CELL. YOU HAD A
###2598 QUESTION? IS THE CUTICLE A NON-LIVING LAYER? A VERY
###2603 GOOD POINT. THE CUTICLE IS NOT LIVING. IT IS SECRETED
###2606 BY THE LIVING CELLS OF THE EPIDERMIS CELLS BUT IT IS
###2609 NOT LIVING. GOOD QUESTION. FINALLY, WHAT I WANT TO
###2613 MENTION IS, BESIDES MODIFYING THE EPIDERMIS TO HAVING
###2617 A CUTICLE AND HAVING THESE PORES, THERE ARE A COUPLE
###2619 OF OTHER MODIFICATIONS OF THE EPIDERMIS. AND AGAIN,
###2622 THESE ARE USUALLY MEANT TO PROTECT THE PLANT. ONE
###2625 MODIFICATION THAT MANY OF YOU ARE AWARE OF IS THAT
###2628 PLANT SURFACES ARE FREQUENTLY COVERED WITH HAIRS OR
###2632 DIFFERENT TYPES OF THINGS WHICH GROW UP FROM THE
###2634 
###2643 THEY ARE EPIDERMAL OUT-GROWTHS.
###2648 THEY ARE USUALLY INVOLVED IN PROTECTION. FOR
###2654 EXAMPLE, IF A LEAF IS COVERED WITH A SLIGHT LAYER OF
###2656 HAIR THIS MAY ELEVATE AN APHID OR AN INSECT WHICH MAY
###2660 WANTED TO COME IN AND ATTACK THE LEAF. IT COULDN'T GET
###2662 DOWN TO THE LEAF SURFACE BECAUSE IT WAS HELD AWAY BY
###2665 THE HAIRS.
###2666 HERE IS AN EXAMPLE OF EPIDERMAL HAIR THAT MANY
###2668 OF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH, COTTON. COTTON REPRESENTS
###2673 EPIDERMAL HAIR WHICH GROWS OUT OF THE SEED COAT.
###2676 EPIDERMAL HAIR GROWING OUT OF THE SEED COAT. WHY
###2680 WOULD COTTON PRODUCE THESE HAIRS. ONE IDEA IS THIS
###2684 MAKES SEED ATTRACTIVE TO ANIMALS TO USE FOR THEIR
###2687 NESTS. AND AS A RESULT, THEY DISPERSE SEEDS AS
###2690 A RESULT OF COLLECTING THE COTTON AND LINING THEIR
###2693 NESTS AND LATER ON THE SEEDS GET A CHANCE TO
###2695 GERMINATE.
###2699 HAVE EXPLOITED GREATLY. OTHER REASON WHY PLANT PRODUCE
###2702 EPIDERMAL HAIRS IS OFTEN TO REFLECT LIGHT. LIGHT CAN
###2709 BE VERY DAMAGING TO PLANTS AND AS A RESULT THE
###2713 PRODUCTION OF EPIDERMAL HAIRS CAN CAUSE THE LIGHT TO
###2716 BE REFLECTED AWAY. AND I WILL SHOW YOU A PICTURE OF
###2718 THIS IN A MOMENT. FINALLY, EPIDERMAL HAIRS ON THE
###2721 SHOOT SYSTEM ARE EASILY FOUND BY MOST OF YOU. IF YOU
###2724 HAVE EVER TAKEN A GERANIUM AND RUN YOUR HAND AND
###2727 CRUSHED THE LEAF VERY SLIGHTLY, YOU WILL HAVE A SMELL,
###2729 YOU CAN LEAVE THE LIGHTS ON FOR A FEW MINUTES, YOU
###2732 WILL HAVE A SMELL ON THE LEAF, AND THAT SMELL COMES
###2735 ACROSS ON TO YOUR FINGERS. THAT IS BECAUSE OF
###2738 EPIDERMAL GLAND CELLS.
###2739 I WILL SHOW YOU A PICTURE OF THAT IN A MOMENT.
###2748 FINALLY, THE LAST MODIFICATION OF THE EPIDERMIS
###2751 THAT I WANT TO POINT OUT TO YOU IS NOT FOUND IN THE
###2754 SHOOT SYSTEM, BUT IN THE ROOT SYSTEM.
###2766 EPIDERMIS OF THE ROOT. THIS IS THE ROOT EPIDERMIS.
###2774 SOME ROOT EPIDERMAL CELLS WE WILL FIND DEVELOP
###2779 OUT-GROWTH. WHICH IS KNOWN AS A ROOT HAIR. THIS ACTS
###2788 TO INCREASE WATER AND NUTRIENT UPTAKE BY THE ROOT
###2799 BECAUSE IT PROVIDES AN INCREASE SURFACE AREA FOR
###2803 TAKING UP WATER AND NUTRIENTS. SO, THE ROOT HAIR IS
###2807 ALSO EPIDERMAL OUT-GROWTH OR EPIDERMAL MODIFICATION
###2810 WHICH COMES FROM THE OUT-GROWTH OF AN EPIDERMAL CELL.
###2815 AGAIN, PROBABLY IT WOULD NOT THE EFFICIENT FOR ROOTS
###2818 TO HAVE A CUTICLE IN THEM BECAUSE THEY FUNCTION IN
###2821 WATER UPTAKE. OKAY, WE CAN DO THE SLIDES NOW. FIRST
###2825 SLIDE I WANT TO SHOW YOU IS OF THE CUTICLE. SECTION
###2827 OF A LEAF AND I WANT TO POINT OUT TO YOU EPIDERMIS AND
###2831 ALSO POINT OUT TO YOU THE CUTICLE. HERE IS THE
###2834 EPIDERMIS, THESE SMALL CELLS HERE. AND THESE ARE
###2836 PARENCHYMA CELLS UNDERNEATH. AND HERE YOU CAN SEE
###2838 THIS LAYER OF WAX, LAYER OF CUTICLE WHICH IS
###2840 
###2844 EPIDERMAL CELLS. WE ARE LOOKING DOWN ON THE SURFACE
###2847 OF A LEAF. PRETEND LIKE THIS WAS THE BLACKBOARD. HERE
###2850 YOU CAN SEE THE VERY TIGHTLY JOINED EPIDERMAL CELLS
###2853 BUT OCCASIONALLY SOME OF EPIDERMAL CELLS ARE
###2856 ASSOCIATED WITH THE STOMATA COMPLEX.
###2858 HERE IS THE PORE THAT WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE.
###2861 HERE ARE THE TWO GUARD CELLS, WHICH CONTROL THE SIZE
###2864 OF THE PORE. ANOTHER, MAYBE A CLOSER LARGER EXAMPLE OF
###2868 THE GUARD CELL. AGAIN THE PORE AND THESE TWO GUARD
###2872 CELLS AND OTHER REGULAR EPIDERMAL CELLS SURROUNDING
###2874 IT. THIS IS A SCANNING ELECTROMICROSCOPE PICTURE OF
###2877 AN EPIDERMAL CELL, OF A STOMATA COMPLEX CELL AND HERE
###2881 YOU CAN SEE THE PORE AND THE TWO GUARD CELLS ON EITHER
###2884 SIDE, WHICH FUNCTION TO DETERMINE THE SIZE OF THE
###2887 OPENING. LAST FEW SLIDES I WANT TO SHOW YOU ARE CELLS
###2891 THAT ALL OF YOU HAVE USED BEFORE. THESE ARE CELLS
###2894 WHICH ARE GLANDULAR HAIRS. THEY SECRETE A MATERIALS.
###2897 
###2902 INJECT TOXINS INTO ANIMALS THAT MIGHT COME AND FEED ON
###2905 THE PLANT. SO, SOME OF THE HAIRS THAT YOU GET ON YOUR
###2907 HAND WHEN YOU TOUCH A PLANT ARE ACTUALLY CONTAINING
###2911 TOXINS FROM THE EPIDERMIS. HERE IS GLANDULAR HAIR
###2914 WITH THE SOLUTION ON THE TOP. HERE IS ANOTHER ONE. WE
###2918 HAVE BROKEN OFF THE TIP OF THE GLAND AND NOW THE
###2920 SOLUTION IS COMING OUT. THIS MAY BE TOXIC AND
###2923 FRAGRANT IN SOME WAY. HERE IS COTTON. AGAIN, COTTON
###2927 REPRESENTS OUT-GROWTH OF HAIRS FROM THE EPIDERMIS OF
###2930 THE SEED COAT AND HERE IS A PICTURE OF THE VERY
###2932 BEGINNING, HERE IS THE EPIDERMIS OF THE SEED. THE
###2935 SEED WOULD BE DOWN HERE. AND HERE ARE THE EPIDERMAL
###2938 HAIRS GROWING OUT AND THEY GET TO BE VERY LONG. THEY
###2941 ARE JUST A SINGLE CELL. AND FINALLY, THIS LAST SLIDE
###2943 IS KIND OF AN INTERESTING SLIDE I WANTED TO SHOW YOU.
###2946 THIS SLIDE IS TAKEN IN THE ANDES ABOUT 15,000 FEET IN
###2950 ELEVATION. AND AT THAT ELEVATION LIGHT IS EXTREMELY
###2953 
###2956 PHOTOSYNTHETIC APPARATUS. THIS IS A MAN OBVIOUSLY
###2958 STANDING HERE AND THIS IS A CACTUS. THIS CACTUS IS
###2962 COVERED ITSELF WITH EPIDERMAL HAIRS, WITH EPIDERMAL
###2964 OUT-GROWTH TO REFLECT THE LIGHT AND ALSO TO SLOW DOWN
###2969 THE LOSS OF WATER IN THIS VERY DRY ENVIRONMENT. OKAY,
###2972 WE WILL CONTINUE TALKING ABOUT THE BODY NEXT WEEK.
