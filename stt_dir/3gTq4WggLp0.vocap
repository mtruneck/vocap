###6 It's a marble masterpiece,
###8 one of the most famous buildings in the world.
###11 The Leaning Tower of Pisa is simply an impossibility.
###14 More like something you dream than something that can exist.
###18 For hundreds of years, the world has watched in amazement
###21 as the building defies gravity teetering on a razor's edge.
###25 It really is quite miraculous that it has not fallen over.
###29 And thank goodness it hasn't.
###31 If the Tower were to fall no one would feel it
###34 more than the people of Pisa.
###36 For them the Tower is the heart of their city.
###39 It is what draws hundreds of thousands of tourists every year,
###42 each one anxious to give a helping hand.
###52 It really needs one. The Leaning Tower of Pisa can tumble
###56 in an instant.
###57 For 800 years architects and engineers have been trying to
###61 fiix the Leaning Tower of Pisa.
###63 Nearly every attempt has been disastrous.
###66 But somehow the Tower has serenely survived.
###74 Today the Tower is in greater danger than ever.
###76 It's lean is so extreme
###78 that the Italian government has closed it to avoid a potential disaster.
###89 It's been more than ten years since anyone has walked up its marble
###92 stairway which leads to its stunning bell chamber
###96 until now.
###98 We will take a behind the scenes look inside the Tower
###101 that's been locked off to the public for so long
###104 and climb to the top for a rare view of its breathtaking vistas.
###110 We'll examine the bizarre history of the 800 year effort to
###113 save the Tower and introduce the current plan that some believe
###116 just may make the Tower safe forever,
###120 that is if it doesn't destroy it first.
###125 Today, the Tower is in crisis a patient in intensive care.
###130 830 tons of lead have been added to hold down its north side.
###135 Steel bands cinch its waist.
###137 340-foot long cables are wrapped around it to prevent
###141 an impending catastrophe,
###143 while a group of international experts struggle to fiind
###146 a permanent solution.
###151 Michele Jamiolkowski a geo-technical engineer
###155 is the chairman of the current team to save the Tower.
###158 This is not an easy task.
###160 Not only me, but all the other members of the committee
###165 became acquainted with the responsibility and with the risk
###169 which we are incurring with this task.
###174 Their goal is to reduce the Tower's lean by about 16 inches.
###178 This would take the Tower out of danger, but keep it looking the same.
###183 After all, no one wants a straight Tower of Pisa.
###187 We never considered straightening the Tower, because the inclination
###191 is part of its character.
###193 It's absolutely central to Pisa.
###197 So there are two unacceptable scenarios really, aren't there?
###201 One would be a straight Tower but the other one would be
###204 one that fell over.
###207 The common perception is that the Tower is in danger of tipping over.
###211 In fact, that is only one of two perils that could reduce it to rubble.
###215 One problem is the very well known continuous increase of inclination,
###221 which was bringing the Tower to falling over.
###225 And the second problem was the concern about the structural collapse.
###230 The first problem, the Tower's increasing slant is due to the soft
###234 soil it is built on.
###237 Professor Carlo Viggiani is a member of the committee to save the Tower.
###241 He has been studying the Tower for over 35 years.
###244 The leaning was by change. Probably because on the south
###248 side of the Tower
###249 the subsoil was weaker than the north side.
###253 So, and once it started to lean from that side, then the weight is
###258 going on that side
###260 and the thing is continuously increasing.
###264 By 1990, the Tower was leaning at an astounding five
###268 and a half degrees,
###269 or 17 feet off the perpendicular.
###272 It literally defies the laws of physics.
###277 Committee member John Burland is a professor of soil mechanics.
###281 I think it's miraculous.
###283 I mean, when we came here in 1990,
###285 we couldn't get it to stand up on our computer.
###288 It's leaning at 5.5 degrees. We could only get our computer
###291 Tower to lean at 5.44 degrees and then it used to fall over.
###296 So it really is quite miraculous that it has not fallen over.
###301 The Tower isn't just in danger of falling,
###304 it can collapse under its own weight.
###307 Part of the problem stems from its structure.
###310 Although the Tower appears solid,
###312 it's actually a hollow cylinder reaching 185 feet into the sky.
###317 Within it, a staircase winds up to the top.
###320 Most of its 14,000 tons are supported by its walls.
###324 Its walls, however, aren't solid either.
###328 They're stone, lime and mortar, covered with a thin marble facade.
###332 One side with all of the stone is getting a lot of pressure.
###336 The other side with all of its stone is not getting that pressure,
###340 so there is an inequality.
###344 As the Tower's lean continues the pressure intensifies.
###348 Eventually the marble in this second floor section
###350 will give way the building will collapse upon itself.
###379 It could explode at any time, or this was the case in 1990 anyway.
###383 So we've got a Tower that's just about to fall over and it's
###386 on the point of exploding.
###388 And that makes it probably the biggest civil engineering
###391 challenge there is.
###394 Solving the challenge of the Tower has stumped
###397 generations of engineers.
###398 Its problems began almost as soon as it was built.
###403 When plans for the Tower were first drawn up in the 12th Century,
###406 a spot was chosen with a commanding view of Pisa.
###409 It was beautiful.
###411 But not a very good place to build,
###413 since in ancient Italy the site had been a lagoon.
###420 Piero Pierotti, is an art historian and professor of medieval architecture
###424 at the University of Pisa.
###428 Pisa was a system of islands in the middle of a very wide lagoon.
###433 This lagoon was slowly filled in by the two most important
###436 Tuscan rivers. The Arno and the Auser.
###439 And where the rivers had filled in, they left mud,
###442 which is softer and wet.
###445 The soft wet soil left behind by the rivers was where the Tower was built.
###451 The ground is so soft that it's really like building a brick Tower
###456 on a soft carpet.
###457 You can go to a certain height,
###460 and no matter how straight you try and keep that Tower,
###464 it will start to lean and then fall over.
###467 Why build a Tower doomed to lean?
###470 Although the medieval architects knew that the soil was soft,
###473 they may not have known how soft.
###475 They thought they had found the perfect spot to build a monument
###479 to the glory of Pisa.
###482 Today, Pisa is a quiet university town of 100,000.
###486 In the 11 th Century, it was a powerful city-state.
###489 Its navy roved the seas conquering other cities.
###493 In 1062, the Pisa navy sailed to Palermo, the capital of Sicily,
###498 bent on conquest.
###503 When Pisa's fleet arrived in Palermo...
###506 the Sicilians they encountered there said that the citizens of Pisa
###509 were the meanest and most ignorant people they had ever met.
###513 In reality, there was this strong arrogance of considering
###517 themselves the first, the best.
###519 This arrogance made it easy for other cities to fiind allies against Pisa.
###526 In 1063, the victorious Pisan navy returned,
###530 their chests bursting with pride and their pockets bursting
###533 with Sicilian money.
###536 They decided to build a glorious square, the religious center
###540 of medieval Pisa,
###541 the square known today as the Piazza dei Miracoli,
###545 Square of Miracles.
###550 It would have a magnificent cathedral, one that would surpass
###554 any other church in Italy.
###557 Next to it would be a baptistery where Pisa's richest citizens
###560 could be baptized.
###564 It's crowning glory,
###565 the masterpiece of Pisan civilization would be the cathedral's bell Tower,
###569 or campanile.
###573 On August Ninth, 1173, the foundation for the Tower was laid,
###578 directed it is thought, by Pisan architect, Bonnano Pisano.
###584 By the time the third level was built the Tower was starting to
###587 settle unevenly.
###588 It was leaning north not south as it does today.
###592 The Italians weren't worried.
###594 Many buildings in Pisa leaned a little.
###597 They simply compensated
###598 by making the columns and arches on the north side of the third
###601 level a little taller.
###605 Pisa had something like 10,000 towers.
###608 It was known that an adjustment of the ground was necessary.
###611 They would start construction and they would look onto
###614 which side the Tower was leaning
###616 and would build up the other side.
###618 They didn't have the technology which we have now.
###621 If we were doing the Tower now we would have driven
###623 what are called piles
###625 down onto that dense sand 40 meters down.
###629 But they didn't have that technology in 1173.
###632 They just learnt that you could build towers to a certain height
###637 from years and centuries of experience.
###641 But what they had learned from experience,
###643 did not hold true for this Tower.
###645 The soil here was softer and the Tower would have fallen
###648 if they continued building.
###650 But they didn't.
###652 In 1178, construction stopped.
###655 Some historians say it was because the Tower was tilting too much.
###658 Others say it was political and military troubles in Pisa.
###662 Whatever the reason, the delay lasted 100 years.
###667 The Tower survived only because the interruption allowed
###671 the soil beneath the Tower
###674 to settle to include the resistance and to support the fiinal
###678 lot of the Tower.
###680 When work resumed in the 13th Century the Tower was leaning
###684 about seven inches to the north. As building continued upwards,
###688 the Tower began to tilt in the opposite direction.
###691 This time, the masons tried to correct the tilt by making the stones
###695 on the south side taller.
###697 They corrected the shape just to bring the Tower in a vertical position
###703 so that the Tower is not actually straight.
###707 It is like a banana. It is shaped in this way.
###711 In 1278, work on the Tower stopped just short of the fiinal floor.
###716 82 years passed before architect Tomasso Andrea di Pisa came
###720 on to build the bell chamber.
###723 By 1370, the Tower was complete and the original vision of the great
###727 square with its Tower was realized.
###729 But as soon as the Tower reached its full height,
###732 the lean started to accelerate.
###734 They didn't realize that by putting the little bell chamber on top
###738 it was really going to start moving.
###741 They didn't have that understanding at that time.
###744 It was thought at the time that the bell chamber would stabilize the Tower
###750 The bell chamber is designed to correct the problem, to balance out
###754 the whole preexisting structure.
###757 The 14th Century solution was to build a different number of steps
###761 on each side of the bell chamber.
###763 On the north side were four steps,
###766 on the south, six.
###768 In total, the south side ended up being 34 inches higher than the north.
###774 To further balance the weight larger bells were placed on the north side.
###779 Finally, Pisa's cathedral had its Tower, and the Tower had its voice.
###796 Next to the entrance to the Tower masons sculpted a relief of two ships
###800 entering the Pisan port, as a tribute to Pisa's
###803 mighty marine power.
###804 Unfortunately by this time, Pisa's marine power wasn't very mighty.
###810 The Tower conceived as symbol of Pisa's grandeur,
###813 was now, a crooked testament to the city's faded dreams.
###818 I am sure that many explained to you in a precise, technical way
###822 why the Tower is leaning.
###824 But if we wanted to joke, the Tower could be leaning for another reason.
###828 Its imperfection could be considered a symbol of the death
###831 that was already inside the society of Pisa.
###835 The Square was supposed to be completely paved in marble.
###838 It was never paved the grass is still here.
###841 It wasn't supposed to be this way.
###843 And all of this gives the idea of what was thought that
###847 this city would become and never became.
###851 The people of Pisa would try for centuries to straighten
###854 the whole thing out.
###871 >From the moment it was complete the leaning Tower was crooked
###875 and loved by the people of Pisa.
###877 It is one of the miraculous structures of the Middles Ages.
###883 And especially since it started to fall,
###886 it gave it a kind of reclame that
###888 normally it might not have.
###890 It quickly became the center of public life.
###894 Big feasts and celebrations took place on the Piazza.
###898 Standing on the balconies every family and even their guests
###902 had a privileged space.
###903 They could come out like they did from the balconies
###906 of their own palaces.
###907 It was like having a reserved box for the theater.
###911 In 1590, the Tower even played host to a little known local scientist,
###917 named Galileo.
###919 Legend has it he conducted his famous experiments with gravity
###923 from its bell chamber.
###927 While the Tower's lean wasn't increasing much,
###929 the building was sinking.
###932 By the 19th Century, the Tower was slumping down
###935 about 10 feet into the ground.
###937 And a part of the first floor was completely obscured.
###940 And in 1838, an Italian architect Alessandro Gheradesca,
###945 decided to do something about it.
###947 Alessandro Gheradesca said "Wouldn't it be a wonderful idea
###952 to dig out around the foundation so everyone can look in
###955 and see these lovely columns going down to the base of the Tower?"
###959 So he went in there and dug out this walkway around the base of the Tower
###964 that's called the catino.
###966 Unknown to Gheradesca, there was a water table
###969 within yards of the surface.
###971 No sooner had he dug down, than water came gushing in.
###977 Suddenly, the Tower that had stood serenely and safely for five centuries,
###981 lost its balance.
###982 It lunged over a foot.
###986 And how it didn't fall over, we really don't know.
###989 It was another miracle that it didn't.
###991 The Tower had survived the first modern attempt to improve it.
###995 And for 70 years, no further attempts to help it were made.
###1000 Then, in 1902, Venice's St. Marco's Square, a bell
###1004 Tower came crashing down.
###1007 It had stood more than 1,000 years.
###1011 But on the morning of July 14th, a huge crack snaked up the Tower
###1015 and the whole structure collapse into an 18,000-ton pile of dust
###1019 and rubble.
###1023 It took some two days that collapse so there were no people
###1028 killed by that.
###1030 But it was impossible to stop that collapse.
###1033 Scared by the disaster in Venice the Italian government
###1036 formed a committee to study Pisa's Tower.
###1039 Experts reviewed the leaning Tower's condition, but nothing was done
###1042 to stabilize it.
###1047 That is until 1933, when fascist dictator, Benito Mussolini,
###1052 turned his attention to the Tower.
###1057 Mussolini was obsessed with returning Italy to the glory it hasn't
###1060 known for several centuries.
###1062 It was unthinkable that Italy's national symbol should be
###1065 a tilting Tower.
###1067 He had made the trains run on time,
###1069 how difficult would it be to straighten a Tower?
###1072 The idea was to try and inject cement into the foundation
###1077 masonry, not into the ground but into the masonry.
###1080 And the reason being that water was seeping
###1084 up through Gheradesca's catino up through the masonry
###1088 and washing out the mortar.
###1092 Mussolini's engineers thought that excess water under the Tower
###1096 was weakening the foundation. They decided to seal the base of
###1099 the Tower with concrete to prevent water from seeping in from below.
###1105 Workers drilled over 361 holes into the Tower's foundations.
###1110 Then they pumped in over 80 tons of cement.
###1115 Once again, the Tower's delicate balance was shattered
###1119 and it lurched southward nearly three and a half inches.
###1123 Now the Tower was in real danger but there was no time to fiix it.
###1127 World War II had started.
###1129 American soldiers were hitting the back door of Hitler's fortress.
###1134 This was Italy.
###1137 Bombs were raining down on Italy,
###1139 reducing large sections to rubble.
###1141 In 1944, the Allies entered Pisa hoping to control the Arno River,
###1146 which ran through the city on its way to the Mediterranean Sea.
###1150 The Allied troops found themselves under attack by artillery fire
###1154 from above.
###1156 But where could it be coming from?
###1159 The Germans, as they were retreating demolished all the bell towers
###1163 because they could be observation posts.
###1166 So the bell towers of important churches were demolished.
###1169 Obviously the most important of the bell towers was this one
###1172 and it has not been demolished.
###1175 The Allies suspected the Germans were firing from the Leaning Tower of Pisa.
###1180 US Sergeant Leon Weckstein, a scout with the 91st Infantry division,
###1184 received his orders in July 1944. He was to take out what soldiers called,
###1190 The Tiltin' Hilton,
###1191 and if he detected any enemy action blow it to smithereens.
###1197 Weckstein would recall his mission 50 years later
###1200 in his memoir, Through My Eyes.
###1203 I was sent out to get as close as I could to the Tower.
###1207 And if I saw any action up there at all, I was to direct all
###1212 these weapons against the Tower to get it out of the way.
###1215 In those days, we were very gung-ho.
###1221 If it meant the life of one of our men, we would have destroyed
###1225 the Tower very easily.
###1227 Weckstein watched for hours.
###1229 Nothing seemed move inside the Tower.
###1232 He thought about blasting it to pieces anyway, just in case.
###1236 On a basis of suspicion, I might have just said, go ahead,
###1240 fire, you know?
###1242 But there might have been an ounce of sentiment in seeing
###1244 this beautiful Tower and what it was. And probably that registered
###1253 strongly enough for me to withhold any rash movement on my part.
###1258 Then, artillery bursts began exploding above Weckstein's head.
###1263 Judging by the direction of the fire,
###1265 Weckstein reported to his commander that there were Germans in the Tower.
###1269 The fate of the building hung on the US Army's next decision.
###1274 At the last minute, Weckstein was ordered to retreat.
###1278 The army had spared the beautiful building.
###1280 The Leaning Tower of Pisa had survived World War II,
###1284 for the most part.
###1287 The only serious damage to the Tower during the war was the breaking
###1291 of a small column,
###1293 not due indeed to the Allied Forces attacks, but simply to a mistake of the
###1298 Pisan anti-aircraft, which was not capable of striking one aircraft
###1302 during the whole war,
###1303 but was able to strike a small column of the bell Tower.
###1309 In the post war years, the Tower became a favorite attraction
###1312 for tourists in Europe.
###1314 Meanwhile, it continued its slow swoop downward.
###1317 At the beginning of the century there was not a great concern
###1321 about the tower.
###1322 And even in 1940,1950, the increase of inclination was very, very little.
###1329 But the speed of inclination increased so in 1990 it was doubled.
###1335 By the end of the 1980's, the Tower was leaning 17 feet off
###1339 the perpendicular.
###1341 The more the Tower leaned, the more its unevenly distributed
###1345 weight pressed against the blocks of marble
###1347 that made up its thin facade
###1350 and the greater the risk that the marble would give way.
###1353 The Tower obviously was ever in the danger of collapse,
###1357 but with the progressive inclination the safety margin was decreasing.
###1364 The collapse of Tower was expected in next 30 to 50 years.
###1369 Despite the growing risk,
###1371 the Italian government didn't authorize any action until 1989,
###1375 when a 900-year old bell tower in nearby Pavia came crashing down.
###1380 And it wasn't even leaning.
###1383 This was sudden collapse.
###1385 It took ten or 20 seconds, not more.
###1388 And unfortunately we had some people killed in that collapse.
###1395 The Italian government announced that Pisa's Tower was unsafe.
###1399 No longer would the Leaning Tower be able to welcome the hundreds
###1402 of thousands of people who traveled from everywhere to see it.
###1406 At three o'clock on January seventh 1990,
###1409 Italy's most famous building closed its doors.
###1416 To see the Tower closed for the first time in its history
###1419 for security reasons,
###1421 it made you realize that there was a real risk, a concrete danger.
###1430 That day I cried. What a sin.
###1432 It was beautiful.
###1434 Then to see the Tower without anyone in it, it was no longer beautiful.
###1438 It was sad, very sad.
###1442 The closing of the Leaning Tower of Pisa could have been
###1445 easily avoided.
###1446 This was done to dramatize the problems that the Tower faced
###1450 and in order to justify this radical intervention.
###1454 Because when there is a dramatic case,
###1456 a close danger, then the money is forthcoming.
###1463 In 1990, the Italian government formed a committee of engineers
###1467 to save the Tower once and for all.
###1470 They began by reviewing potential solutions.
###1473 Proposals poured in from all over the world.
###1476 You get some really wacky ideas like balloons and growing
###1479 trees up the middle and so on,
###1482 which are good fun but not very serious.
###1506 As creative solutions were studied engineers gathered data.
###1511 Measurements taken throughout the century, were used to
###1513 track the Tower's lean.
###1516 And in 1992, a computerized monitoring system was installed
###1520 to keep track of the Tower's smallest movements.
###1523 Sensors were attached to very major crack.
###1526 If a crack widened, it could be the start of a structural collapse.
###1530 These instruments, measure the thickness of the crack in real time,
###1536 so we have nine years of recording of the movements of these cracks.
###1543 A routine was established that continues to this day.
###1547 Every morning a technician enters the tower to check on its condition.
###1553 Through a horizontally leveled telescope,
###1555 any increase in the tower's tilt can be detected up to
###1558 one 100th of a millimeter.
###1562 Taut wires cut across the tower to measure any distortion
###1565 in the structure.
###1568 Three pendulums incased in gray tubes track any shift
###1572 in the tower's center.
###1573 They hang from the seventh level down to the first floor.
###1580 After two years, the team studying the Tower still couldn't agree
###1584 on how to fiix it.
###1585 But they were ready to try some temporary solutions.
###1590 Their first task was to strengthen the Tower at its weakest point,
###1594 the critical zone.
###1596 The inclination of the Tower is creating very high compression
###1602 on this side,
###1603 because the Tower is inclined in this direction.
###1607 This edge is really the position in which the compression
###1612 stress is the highest one.
###1614 So the fail of the collapse would begin certainly in this position
###1620 if would happen.
###1622 Workers wrapped a belt of plastic covered steel cables
###1625 around the Tower's second story in an effort to keep the cracks
###1628 from widening further.
###1630 The operation went smoothly.
###1633 The band of steel was discreet enough not to arouse any protest.
###1638 Then, over the course of six months 600 tons of lead weights
###1642 were methodically added to the base of the north side to keep the lean
###1646 from getting worse.
###1649 The first lead weight was added on July 13, 1993.
###1654 Nervous engineers recorded every step of the process
###1657 with their own cameras.
###1659 Tests were carried out to calculate how the Tower was reacting
###1663 to the lead weights.
###1664 But nothing is certain with a building that is so unique.
###1668 We put the first lead weight on and we got a positive response.
###1672 Because it was by no means certain that we would,
###1675 it was very nerve wracking.
###1676 The tension was really very high indeed.
###1680 After the last weight was added,
###1682 monitors registered a northward movement of almost an inch.
###1687 The intervention had been a success.
###1690 It was a historical moment.
###1692 For the first time in 800 years the Leaning Tower of Pisa
###1696 moved back the other way.
###1699 There was just one snag.
###1701 The lead weights were an eyesore.
###1703 Art experts protested.
###1705 The people of Pisa complained.
###1707 The weights had to go.
###1709 The lead weights are rather ugly.
###1711 And in Italy they have a saying that anything temporary
###1714 becomes permanent.
###1716 And so, the Tower's engineers came up with a daring and complex plan,
###1721 a plan that some feared would destroy the treasured Tower.
###1727 The plan to eliminate the weights holding the Tower down was
###1730 so controversial and so filled with danger,
###1733 that it's outcome came to be known as Black September.
###1737 The idea was to build a concrete ring round the Tower's base
###1741 from which ten cables would be driven 50 meters underground
###1744 to anchor the Tower in place.
###1747 Laying the concrete ring was a dangerous task.
###1750 Workers would have to dig under the catino, the walkway
###1753 around the base of the Tower.
###1755 The ground was full of water and once digging started,
###1758 the water might gush up.
###1760 But the engineers in charge were confident they had a way around that.
###1765 The ground would be frozen using liquid nitrogen.
###1768 The frozen ground would form a physical barrier
###1771 that would stop ground water from flowing into the shallow
###1773 excavation the concrete ring would be built in.
###1777 Before the freeze started, engineers came across something puzzling.
###1781 There was already another concrete ring in the ground,
###1784 and it was attached to the Tower.
###1787 Engineers guessed that it dated back to the 1800's.
###1790 There was nothing about this ring in historical records,
###1793 but it seemed safe to go ahead.
###1796 On September seventh, workers started freezing the ground.
###1804 They made some holes around the tower.
###1806 And inside these holes they put liquid nitrogen,
###1810 practically transforming all the ground underneath the tower
###1813 into a freezer.
###1817 For 36 hours liquid nitrogen was pumped into the soil.
###1821 At first, the Tower didn't react.
###1824 Then over night, the Tower suddenly moved one 16th of an inch,
###1828 an amount almost equal to what the tower moves in a year.
###1832 As we froze the ground the ice reacted against
###1836 this concrete in the ground
###1838 and caused the tower to move adversely.
###1841 And as soon as that happened we stopped the job.
###1845 When the water in the soil froze it expanded.
###1848 The expanded soil pushed the concrete ring down,
###1851 leaving a gap between the Tower and the ring.
###1854 Once the soil defrosted, the tower sank down into this space,
###1858 and lurched further south.
###1860 I was extremely worried.
###1862 And this was really a very very difficult week.
###1867 We faced a serious risk of losing the tower, because
###1871 when Tower started to rotate toward the south with this rate,
###1878 nobody was able to evaluate if the Tower will stop or not.
###1885 Desperate to stop the Tower from leaning further,
###1887 engineers quickly added another 230 tons of lead weight to
###1891 the Tower's base.
###1893 The Tower stopped moving.
###1895 But instead of fewer weights there were now more.
###1898 And the tilt, instead of diminishing was increasing.
###1901 Nothing had gone according to plan.
###1906 This is a strange monument and one that has had too many doctors
###1910 trying to fiix it.
###1911 The Tower has most often been at risk of falling down,
###1914 not from what ails it,
###1916 but due to the mistakes of its doctors who have been exaggerating
###1920 with their cure.
###1921 In effect, the Tower has most often been in danger when there
###1924 were external interventions.
###1928 All of Italy was outraged.
###1930 After five years of studying the Tower with the most advanced
###1934 technology available,
###1935 somehow the problem was worse.
###1940 Shortly after the deep freeze of 1995 all work on the Tower stopped.
###1947 The Tower remained closed.
###1950 No one in Pisa knew when, if ever it would open again.
###1954 It was a painful situation for a city that identified so completely
###1958 with the monument.
###1961 It's the maximum.
###1961 It's the emblem of the city.
###1963 Because when we go around the world when we say where we are from,
###1966 that we are from Pisa, the first the first association is the Tower.
###1972 The Tower is a universal symbol for the citizens of Pisa.
###1976 As a little girl I used to always come here to the Piazza.
###1979 And slowly, a passion began to grow within me as I became aware
###1983 and began to understand the importance of the monument.
###1992 The Tower was like a lung something that we felt.
###1995 Not only because people had once climbed it, that makes it alive,
###1999 but also because closing it brings a little economic damage.
###2006 Pisans from all walks of life felt the closing of the Tower
###2009 in their hearts,
###2010 not to mention their pocket books.
###2013 It's the Tower that attracts the tourist.
###2015 As soon as tourists arrive, they see the Tower and that's it.
###2019 They don't see the other things.
###2021 When the Tower was open, there was a line, the people would climb
###2025 on the Tower, they would have time to eat, they would come
###2028 to our restaurants.
###2029 A lot of people would stop to have a cappuccino.
###2032 And then they would go inside the Tower.
###2034 Now instead, since the Tower is shut down, our work is a
###2038 hit and run.
###2039 Tourists arrive, they take some pictures, they do a little bit
###2042 of shopping for some souvenirs,
###2044 and then they run away.
###2047 With the Tower closed, tourism fell by 20 percent.
###2051 It was a frustrating situation for the people of Pisa.
###2055 They depended on tourism and tourism depends on the Tower.
###2061 It is considered one of the most famous structures in the world.
###2064 I believe that there cannot be a person on earth that doesn't know
###2068 what the Tower of Pisa is.
###2071 Tourists come from Japan, from America, from Canada,
###2075 from Australia.
###2076 These are people that have never seen the Tower before,
###2079 and they come here expressly to see the Tower.
###2081 Not to see the city.
###2083 For us, the Tower is an artistic wealth, a priceless property.
###2089 There was great concern about the alterations being made to
###2092 this priceless property.
###2094 At Columbia University in New York James Beck, a professor
###2098 of art history has founded Art Watch,
###2100 a non profit watchdog organization
###2103 dedicated to protecting artistic treasures.
###2106 Beck advocates an open exchange of ideas to save the Tower.
###2110 It's very bad for the preservation of the Tower that they're so secretive.
###2115 They put in a particular cure and then that cure fails
###2120 and they put in another cure,
###2122 but there's never discussion and careful explanation.
###2125 If you believe that this is an object that belongs to the world,
###2129 then you have to have all of the input that's possible.
###2133 Beck believed that the Tower was not in imminent danger.
###2136 There was time enough to debate the options openly.
###2139 The estimates are 35 to 70 years.
###2142 Therefore, the rush to do these rather stupid interventions
###2147 in some cases, was totally unnecessary.
###2150 Everybody wanted to get credit for saving the Tower of Pisa,
###2153 just because it was good publicity.
###2155 Whatever the objection of critics, by 1998, a new plan
###2159 had been set in motion.
###2160 And if it worked, the Tower would be safe for hundreds of years.
###2168 Italy's team of engineers felt confident that it had come up
###2171 with a way to stabilize the Tower.
###2174 Their solution was a process called soil extraction.
###2178 Engineers would remove soil from the north side of the Tower.
###2182 The remaining soil would start to compress to fill in the gaps
###2185 and the north side would literally settle down.
###2189 We looked at, at least 12 different methods of doing it.
###2194 But the more we looked at it the more we felt
###2197 that we had to get gravity to work for us.
###2201 Most of the solutions had been try to lift the low side.
###2206 Do something to support the south side.
###2209 But in doing that the ground is so soft you would disturb it
###2212 and probably the Tower would fall over.
###2215 And so this solution developed that maybe we could cause
###2219 the north side of the ground to subside in some way.
###2224 And the tower would follow that gravity would cause
###2227 the tower to rotate northwards.
###2229 If the project succeeded,
###2231 the Tower's lean would be reduced by half a degree, or 16 inches.
###2235 Visually, the change would be imperceptible.
###2238 That means that for American and Japanese tourists
###2241 this will make practically no difference.
###2245 The local Pisans greeted the new plan with skepticism.
###2250 They've required a lot of time
###2252 to fiind a way that could insure security and stability to he work,
###2256 that won't present any problems,
###2258 because the Tower could go down very fast.
###2261 One mistake is enough,
###2262 and when the Tower comes down who's going to stop it?
###2267 Soil extraction is a relatively rare technique, but far from new.
###2271 As early as the 1800's,
###2273 it had been used to diminish the lean on St. Chad's Tower in England.
###2278 More recently it had been used successfully
###2280 on the Metropolitan Cathedral in Mexico City.
###2285 But remarkably,
###2286 the technique had been recommended for the Tower of Pisa in 1962,
###2291 when Fernando Terracina, an Italian architect, had submitted the idea.
###2298 What has the committee done in the end?
###2301 After spending ten years and 25 million dollars, what does it do?
###2306 It accepts a project by Fernando Terracina,
###2308 a project of under-excavation from the 1960's.
###2313 Terracina's suggestion was easy to miss.
###2316 It was buried in a technical report three decades old.
###2321 What further astonished critics was that the idea had been
###2324 suggested again in 1990
###2326 by Vittorio Novelli and Nazareno Paccaloni, surveyors
###2330 from Cesna, Italy.
###2337 They told us it was a process that was too violent
###2340 and impossible to carry out.
###2343 I kept in with the president of the committee who, very cordially,
###2347 told me that he was trying to fiind a unanimous decision
###2350 on the choice of an intervention.
###2352 And that our project wasn't taken into consideration.
###2356 Yet, in the end,
###2357 the committee adopted an operation with many similarities to ours.
###2361 In fact, we were a little bit astonished after such a long time,
###2365 nine years.
###2369 With so much at stake
###2370 and with the eyes of the world upon the current team of engineers,
###2373 everyone's nerves became strained.
###2376 It's been incredibly tense.
###2379 You can imagine you don't rush into a tower that is on the point
###2381 of falling over
###2383 and start digging furiously.
###2386 This risk is huge because the Tower could feel unstable
###2390 from one moment to the next since it has been in this position
###2393 for so many centuries.
###2394 We are now all in the hands of these people, waiting.
###2399 It just seems to me it's Keystone Cops.
###2402 And that fact that they had five different operational plans
###2405 in ten years,
###2407 shows that they're not very secure about what they're doing.
###2411 The committee believes in its plan.
###2413 But just in case the Tower moved the wrong way,
###2416 it proposed wrapping two steel cables around the Tower's third level.
###2420 The cables were to be anchored into the ground, 100 yards away.
###2425 If catastrophe struck during the soil extraction, the cables could be
###2429 tensioned to hold the Tower in place.
###2434 There was never any intention that we would use the cables to
###2438 pull the Tower back.
###2439 I think there was one newspaper article, which said,
###2442 "They are going to irresponsibly drag the Tower back by the cables."
###2447 That was never the intention.
###2448 They're simply there to gently hold the Tower if it began to move.
###2454 The cables would in that event be tensioned by lead weights
###2459 so the load on them would be constant.
###2462 Work began in December 1998.
###2465 Putting the cables in position was a major and perilous task.
###2469 Each cable was 340 feet long and two inches thick.
###2475 They were enormously heavy. Just ten yards of cable weighed a half a ton.
###2484 We felt that it was necessary to have those there just so that
###2488 if something went wrong, we could hold the Tower and
###2492 fiind out what was happening and correct it.
###2494 So they are simply a safe guard and the contractor
###2498 calls them his parachute.
###2502 With parachute in place, the way was clear to start
###2505 extracting the soil.
###2509 On the tenth of February, 1999,
###2511 engineers recorded the start of the process.
###2515 First 12 pipes were placed approximately four yards
###2518 from the edge of the Tower.
###2523 Then, with a kind of mechanical corkscrew, the ground was
###2526 removed very gradually from beneath the bell tower.
###2531 At the end of five months the results were in.
###2534 The Tower had moved over half an inch north.
###2538 For the committee, the victory couldn't have been sweeter.
###2541 Finally, after ten years, they had found a method to stabilize the Tower.
###2546 The response has been beyond our wildest expectations.
###2549 It's been very positive.
###2551 We've moved the top of the tower northwards just
###2554 by drilling a few holes.
###2556 Far fewer than we are going to use with the full intervention.
###2560 So at present, it's looking good.
###2562 But you don't raise the flag when you've taken the first
###2565 step up Everest.
###2567 So we have to be very very careful.
###2570 We've got a very, very long way to go still.
###2573 As it turned out, they had even longer to go than they thought.
###2577 Just as they began making progress the money ran out.
###2584 It's a paradox that at the exact moment when the right project
###2588 has fiinally been found,
###2589 there is a risk that the funds to develop it are lacking.
###2592 So, we can see that the relationship between the committee's work
###2596 and the government's response has always been a difficult one
###2599 and sometimes even dramatic.
###2602 The Tower that had survived 800 years of danger,
###2605 was now facing a truly formidable foe the Italian bureaucracy.
###2611 Although many people were infuriated with the committee's slow pace,
###2615 the committee placed the blame squarely elsewhere, the government.
###2619 The whole project has taken an inordinate length of time...
###2624 largely due to Italian bureaucracy.
###2627 We are set up by a law, which has to be renewed every two months,
###2633 and very often it isn't. And we have long, long periods of time,
###2638 anything up to six months or more,
###2640 where we have no mandate.
###2642 And people say, "Why haven't you done anything?"
###2644 The simple answer is, ask the Italian government.
###2648 The mission to save the Tower was once again on hold.
###2656 While the bureaucratic wheels turn slowly, life in Pisa goes on
###2660 as it always has.
###2679 The tourists who visit the Tower know little of its complex history
###2682 or how close it's come to destruction.
###2685 I read that they did something on the foundation
###2688 to keep it from falling over.
###2690 They didn't want to set it up straight, they'd lost tourism, hey?
###2693 And I think they shouldn't.
###2694 It's like if they take the smile away from the Mona Lisa.
###2698 It looks like it's going to fall over.
###2700 Well, it was crooked when they first built it,
###2702 so I'm not surprised that it is still crooked now.
###2705 It does look different now when you see it in real life compared
###2708 to seeing it in books and magazines.
###2709 It's quite different when you're actually right there in front of it
###2711 and you're trying to figure out how it actually got like that
###2713 and how it stays up.
###2714 So, it's amazing.
###2715 It's one example of something that went wrong.
###2717 But at the same time they're trying to fiix it and it's going to
###2719 be a nightmare.
###2720 Just imagine somebody tries to straighten it up and it falls apart.
###2724 We wait.
###2726 Who knows when it will fall?
###2728 It is something everyone wants to witness.
###2731 As the Tower waits for the Italian government to release funds
###2735 so the soil extraction project can resume,
###2737 everyone else waits too.
###2739 We are waiting of the Italian government, because we are now
###2742 not in position to start for a number of bureaucratic
###2747 and fiinancial problems.
###2749 So that we are ready for May and now we are in November waiting
###2755 for someone saying to you, go.
###2758 For everyone, even the engineers working on the Tower,
###2761 it has been a long journey.
###2763 When the work will be fiinished I shall be extremely
###2767 happy to become a free citizen
###2770 and not be involved in Pisa Tower and not
###2774 be involved, the mass media, not be involved in the relations
###2779 with politicians and so on.
###2781 Pisans long for the day the Tower will reopen.
###2785 But no one expects that day to come any time soon.
###2789 Some political problems. Some fiinancial.
###2791 The funds arrive they don't arrive.
###2794 They close the building site they threaten to close,
###2797 then the money returns and we start again.
###2800 In short, these are all the things that we Italians are used to
###2804 and we have to be used to.
###2807 Often I hear the elderly people of Pisa say,
###2810 "But how could it possibly be,
###2811 in the year 2000, when everything has been invented,
###2814 and we live in an information age where man has gone into space,
###2817 that a tower like this one takes more than ten years to stabilize?"
###2823 At the beginning they were talking about six months, then a year.
###2826 Nobody could have known that the work would last ten years
###2830 and still continues.
###2833 Once the soil extraction can be exhumed and completed,
###2837 the Tower will, presumably, be stabilized and can be open to
###2840 the public again.
###2842 Or will it?
###2843 The problem to open the Tower has not yet been discussed
###2848 by the committee.
###2850 Because a large part of these people believe that the Tower
###2855 should be admired from the square not climbing up.
###2859 We expected that the Tower would have opened again for the millennium.
###2863 Instead we found out that the work will go on
###2866 and that nothing is certain anymore.
###2868 I fiind all of this deeply unfair.
###2870 We are fighting to have the tower reopened so that everyone
###2873 can once again admire its beauty.
###2877 We have faith and we hope to see the Tower soon beautiful
###2880 and smiling like once it was.
###2884 No one can imagine a Pisa without its Tower.
###2887 The Tower is simply unique,
###2889 with a unique hold on the imagination of Italy and the world.
###2892 There's a little quirk in the wonderful Italian romance
###2896 that likes things that are a little different.
###2897 And the fact that this is a leaning tower,
###2900 as opposed to just an old building,
###2903 is romantic in their eyes.
###2906 Actually, I'm convinced that no architect in the world today
###2909 would be capable of creating a thing like this.
###2912 They could dream of it, but defiinitely not build it.
###2915 Nature decided it would be tilted,
###2918 that it would come out inclined,
###2920 therefore people come to see this miracle this is still standing.
###2925 It is so magnificent.
###2927 Such a beautiful structure.
###2930 And the whole Piazza is so beautiful.
###2932 It really would be unthinkable that the Tower should be
###2936 lost really to the world.
###2938 I hope the future is at least another 300 years.
###2943 The future of the Leaning Tower of Pisa remains as uncertain as ever.
###2948 But for 800 years the Tower has risen above human folly,
###2952 serenely surviving friend and foe.
###2958 And it continues to do so today soaring into the sky,
###2961 magnificent and improbable beautiful and strange,
###2966 a wonder of the world.
