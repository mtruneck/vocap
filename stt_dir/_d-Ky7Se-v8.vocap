###9 NARRATOR: Much has changed in the valley, and
###11 much remains the same.
###12 The farmer tills his fields today as his
###15 ancestors did in ages past.
###17 A heritage endures.
###20 The people of the valley come and go.
###22 Life, in village and city goes on as generations have come
###27 and gone, the mountain streams have flowed on.
###30 The friendly earth still yields its produce.
###33 And cradling the valley, now as always, silent, lofty
###37 mountains keep their eternal vigil.

###51 DAVID FEINBERG: Every piece of coal in China is intended to
###53 go through one of the national coal factories.
###57 This is a private coal mine that was shut down by the
###59 authorities.
###61 Private mining is illegal, but since there's such a crazy
###64 demand for coal, a lot of people try to start their own
###67 mine in order to profit from the lucrative black market.
###71 Most of them are not successful and get fined or
###74 put in jail.

###113 DAVID FEINBERG: The enormous government
###115 factories are easy to spot.
###116 We drove by a lot of them but never hung out for very long
###120 because we didn't want the security guards to see us.
###123 -[SPEAKING CHINESE]
###124 
###140 DAVID FEINBERG: To get a better sense of the illegal
###142 coal industry, we went into the hills about two hours
###145 outside of Linfen.
###147 The area was still dense with pollution, and we started to
###150 see smaller factories and then what appeared to be some
###153 illegal mines.
###155 Since they're not regulated by the government and are
###158 operated using old methods, the illegal mines are a big
###161 part of the pollution problem.

###273 DAVID FEINBERG: Most of the people we approached for
###275 interviews were very friendly with us.
###277 
###280 But pretty soon they realized that the questions we were
###282 asking could get them in trouble.
###286 A lot of the residents of Linfen have been excluded from
###288 the economic prosperity that has come to the region.
###292 It's basically what happens when a bunch of farmers are
###295 forced to try to make a living from harvesting coal instead
###298 of harvesting crops.
###301 Everywhere we went, people seemed to be scavenging for
###304 bricks, metal, wire or anything else
###306 to make some money.
###308 
###344 After spending a week in Linfen, my
###346 eyes burned a little.
###347 My throat itched, and when I picked my nose, my burgers had
###351 turned black.
###352

###363 
###420 DAVID FEINBERG: After almost a week in Linfen, the police
###422 came to our hotel.
###424 They didn't come to our rooms, but they had the hotel staff
###427 bring us what our translator said were registration forms.
###431 We were afraid that our tapes might get confiscated because,
###434 after all, we were filming illegally.
###437 We were basically there as tourists who happened to have
###440 professional video cameras.
###442 We got a last glimpse of the factories and empty rivers.
###446 It was as good a time as any to leave.
###448 
###451 -We are faced with a very short tiny window to make the
###455 right choices about our future.
###457 So it's not a question about whether or not
###460 China should develop.
###461 China has to develop in order to lift more
###464 people out of poverty.
###466 However, it's more about how China should develop.
###469 The local-level officials are still very much obsessed with
###473 just economic growth.
###475 Really, the evaluation of officials' performance have to
###479 change in a big way in order to give more incentive for
###483 those people on the local level to do more for the
###486 environment.
###487 DAVID FEINBERG: When the World Bank first named Linfen the
###489 most polluted city on earth, the Chinese government set
###492 about to improve the situation--
###494 closing down factories, rerouting truck traffic, and
###498 there were even some signs around the city calling
###500 attention to the problem.
###501 
###536 As for the coal trucks, we were surrounded by them for
###539 another 20 hours as we drove back to Beijing.
###541 
###544 And we sat in our van at one tollbooth for about six hours
###548 in the middle of the night.
###550 All of the fumes helped me sleep through most of it, as
###553 coal trucks idled around us, and the car in front of us ran
###556 out of gas.
###558 
###580 Growing up, my impression of China was of a huge boulevard
###583 entirely full of bicycles.
###585 They've obviously been replaced by cars and trucks.
###588 And if you add the burning of coal to that, as well as all
###591 of the manufacturing that goes on, China is now the world's
###595 leading polluter.
###597 -I think that China is trying its best, tried to host a good
###602 Olympic game, and try to give a good impression for the
###608 whole rest of the word.
###611 Measures tried to clean up air for the Beijing Olympics--
###615 if you look at them, a lot of them are very short term.
###618 It's about shutting down factories, and it's about
###623 having strict transport restrictions.
###627 You would actually be much more smart if we tried to
###632 think of long-term structural solutions.
###636 As a Beijing citizen, if I would have clean air for those
###641 two weeks in Beijing, and then afterwards, I would think, why
###645 can't I have that have every day?
###648 These are all things that can lead to much long-term
###650 thinking after the Olympics.
###654 DAVID FEINBERG: A lot of people say China is going
###656 through its own industrial revolution, but I think that
###659 China's problem is kind of a global problem.
###662 One of the biggest winners from China's economic rise are
###665 the Americans and other multinational companies who
###668 use cheap labor and materials to produce goods that are sent
###671 all over the world.
###673 As big a mess as China has to clean up, the United States is
###677 still the largest per-capita polluter in the world.
###681 China's claims that the blue skies have opened over Linfen
###684 is obviously false, especially when you watch the sunset end
###689 about 20 minutes early, when the sun sets behind an
###692 artificial curtain of smog.
###693 
###699 However, once the sun goes down, the stars do come out to
###703 shine in Linfen.
