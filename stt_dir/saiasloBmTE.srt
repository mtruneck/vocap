1
0:0:0,179 --> 0:0:5,21
so dick cheney ass way b c news about
the vice presidential selection process


2
0:0:5,21 --> 0:0:7,21
while disinterested


3
0:0:7,21 --> 0:0:10,33
that after he said is this a mood
clarified of course has ruled that same


4
0:0:10,33 --> 0:0:12,39
process


5
0:0:12,39 --> 0:0:14,199
how important is it for him to do this


6
0:0:14,199 --> 0:0:18,539
in a way it is different than which are
the cannon office which president pretty


7
0:0:18,539 --> 0:0:21,759
important that one i don't think was
ronald


8
0:0:21,759 --> 0:0:24,269
alike


9
0:0:24,269 --> 0:0:26,33

17
0:0:44,79 --> 0:0:48,34

19
0:0:52,96 --> 0:0:54,59
attractive candidate


20
0:0:54,59 --> 0:0:56,83

26
0:1:7,939 --> 0:1:9,34
dick cheney


27
0:1:9,34 --> 0:1:10,67

28
0:1:10,67 --> 0:1:13,22
back in mid two thousand election


29
0:1:13,22 --> 0:1:16,2
george bush chose dick cheney


30
0:1:16,2 --> 0:1:19,29
to help them select as vice presidential
nominee


31
0:1:19,29 --> 0:1:25,8
and dick cheney came bags and i got the
program for you


32
0:1:25,8 --> 0:1:29,46
now that's a testament to how painfully
stupid george w_ bush is


33
0:1:29,46 --> 0:1:31,48
all right


34
0:1:31,48 --> 0:1:35,74

0:1:35,74 --> 0:1:41,229
anything that cover highlight and yes it
is you did


36
0:1:41,229 --> 0:1:44,37
he things about sort of a candidate is
the pre-k


37
0:1:44,37 --> 0:1:46,24
but it could be derailed


38
0:1:46,24 --> 0:1:46,979
well


39
0:1:46,979 --> 0:1:51,59
massive star anti-war about iraq


40
0:1:51,59 --> 0:1:53,81

had to pick a name you know which in a


42
0:1:57,45 --> 0:1:58,53
major


43
0:1:58,53 --> 0:2:0,59
that janet


44
0:2:0,59 --> 0:2:6,47

46
0:2:9,619 --> 0:2:13,989
what his last upon radio forgettable
wasn't twenties and thirties


47
0:2:13,989 --> 0:2:18,819
when we had a conversation about his
mother fucker for anyway

0:2:18,819 --> 0:2:23,999
i mean we who was taken as some of big
seriously


49
0:2:23,999 --> 0:2:25,949
the hall meteorite


50
0:2:25,949 --> 0:2:29,89
although they drag their reading part
always dick cheney's to dissolved


51
0:2:29,89 --> 0:2:30,56
awkward detainees that's


52
0:2:30,56 --> 0:2:34,379
well john edwards think i don't give a
shit when john edwards thanks

who is this


55
0:2:43,169 --> 0:2:46,139
deeply on popular


56
0:2:46,139 --> 0:2:48,279
walter stokely you would


57
0:2:48,279 --> 0:2:52,609
if i wasn't brocco obama i would run my
campaign


58
0:2:52,609 --> 0:2:54,539
the exact opposite way i'd say look


59
0:2:54,539 --> 0:2:56,29
whatever the case in favor of


60
0:2:56,29 --> 0:2:59,479

61
0:2:59,479 --> 0:3:2,239
dick cheney is a miserable failure


62
0:3:2,239 --> 0:3:4,659
nearly seven seven


63
0:3:4,659 --> 0:3:9,189
one other thing he said was all he had a
deadline capture that damian

123
0:5:57,439 --> 0:7:57,439
at once
