###25 INTERVIEWER: Damn.
###27 Lucky.
###30 Wait, tell me about this place.
###31 
###35 DYLAN RIEDER: I don't want to reveal too much information.
###38 INTERVIEWER: You've gotta tell me something, Bro.
###41 DYLAN RIEDER: It's just a private facility me
###43 and some guys got.
###45 
###48 I designed the [INAUDIBLE] corner,
###50 that was my main piece.
###51 
###71 INTERVIEWER: And we're not supposed to
###72 be filming in here?
###72 DYLAN RIEDER: I don't think we're supposed to
###74 be filming in here.
###75 Whatever, I pay rent, so.
###81 I might get yelled at for this.
###83 But, whatever, my life.
###88 PATRICK O'DELL: What's up?
###89 Welcome back to Epicly Later'd.
###91 This episode's about Dylan Rieder whose hands down one of
###94 the best pros out right now.
###97 He just came out with a part on gravis, just him as the
###102 whole video, and it's amazing.
###104 I guess the only reason he made it is because he wasn't
###106 really that satisfied with the Alien Workshop part that came
###109 out a year ago.
###111 Dylan's amazing, I hope you enjoy the episode.
###114 
###117 DYLAN RIEDER: I grew up in Westminster, a little north of
###121 Huntington Beach, kind of like Korean, Mexican town, a lot of
###128 pool halls, a lot of pho.
###130 I don't think anybody's really from Westminster, none of whom
###132 that skates.
###134 Just Huntington Beach, Dells from Huntington Beach.
###137 I think, Templeton's from Huntington.
###139 Like you ever been to that murdy park down there, it's
###142 like a little ashtray park, I think Templeton designed it.
###144 INTERVIEWER: Yeah, the famous one.
###146 DYLAN RIEDER: No, I think in Huntington Park's the famous
###148 one over by the high school.
###149 Then there's another one before that, that was smaller,
###151 before Huntington Park.
###152 But we used to go there, because we were too
###154 intimidated to go to Huntington Park, because
###155 that's where Andrew went and all those those Warren Avenue
###160 crew dudes, at the time.
###162 I was like 11, maybe 10.
###165 I remember seeing like Andrew at Huntington Park for the
###168 first time, I was pretty star struck.
###172 Saw Penny there a couple times when I was little.
###174 That old Penny footage there is awesome.
###177 He rips that place.
###179 It's not there anymore, they took it out, demolished it to
###182 extend the football fucking field, which is stupid.
###185 INTERVIEWER: So how old are you now?
###186 DYLAN RIEDER: 21.
###188 INTERVIEWER: OK, that seems like you'd be real young when
###191 that was going on.
###192 DYLAN RIEDER: Yeah, I was super young.
###194 Such a little shit head.
###196 MARK OBLOW: I first met Dylan, I was doing a photo shoot for
###199 Quicksilver for their youth campaign.
###202 I would shoot whoever they would bring.
###204 They would bring models, or whatever.
###206 And then at that point Dylan actually had come in, like
###209 they picked him as a little boy model.
###211 And he had come in like that like, and they're like, oh, we
###213 brought a little skater guy, and I was super anti.
###216 I was like, [PHEW], totally get away from me.
###219 We shot some photos, and then they needed action photos.
###221 So then I sent Tim to go shoot some stuff with Ortiz, because
###225 I was like, I ain't even going to waste my fucking time.
###227 I talked to Ortiz later, and I was like, hey, how'd that go?
###230 And Ortiz was like, Dude, he's pretty gnarly.
###233 And I'm like, what do you mean?
###234 What was he pretty gnarly?
###236 He's actually like, Smith Grind this rail and he kick
###239 flipped down these stairs.
###241 And I was just like, what?
###242 Get the fuck out of here, whatever.
###244 So then, Damn Am comes around, he basically is like, can I
###247 come enter the Damn Am?
###249 Can I enter under Quicksilver?
###250 And I'm like, yeah go for it, whatever, it's totally cool.
###252 And then next thing you know, he won the contest.
###255 And I was just like, what the fuck?
###256 From that point on, he basically went on pretty much
###259 every single trip that I did for Quicksilver.
###262 
###267 These are the fucked up ones.
###269 Like this, this was the first Miami trip.
###272 That was his first trip with us.
###275 That was with Janoski, and Donny Barley, and Reece.
###280 But like that was--
###281 INTERVIEWER: He's got braces?
###283 MARK OBLOW: Yeah, he's got braces.
###284 He was such a little, like, little guy.
###287 
###289 The old team right there.
###293 GREG HUNT: I mean, that's something I even, like, I
###295 skate with him all the time and I forget.
###297 Like when he was like 12, he was going on trips with the
###300 Quicksilver guys, like Reece, Stefan, and he was just like
###305 the little kid with men, you know.
###307 And then also with Osiris, I think he went on like a bunch
###309 of trips with Jerry, and all those guys.
###312 So he's got like some pretty deep roots.
###315 Like, once in a while I'll see these old photos, be like, Oh
###318 yeah, were like, one of those little kids.
###321 Misled Youth, or whatever, was his favorite video.
###323 And like, he had like super skin tight pants, he was like
###326 13 years old, he's like one of those kids, like lip sliding
###329 15-stair hand rails, or something.
###331 Going out with his buddies at night, like lighting stuff up
###334 like a bunch of like 15-year-old kids.
###335 Like trying to skate like most gigantic hand rail and almost
###339 killing themselves, you know.
###340 
###344 MARK OBLOW: Jerry has a portrait of him somewhere.
###347 And it's just like this portrait of this baby, it's
###349 like Dylan, it's like this baby face.
###351 JERRY HSU: I first met Dylan when I rode for Osiris.
###355 And I think Chris Pastras was our team manager at the time,
###357 and I don't know where he found him.
###359 I think he went to like a contest or something, and just
###362 found this kid, and just brought him on some trips.
###366 That's how I'd first met him, I'd never heard of him, or
###368 seen photos of him, or anything like that.
###371 But I just trust Chris, because he had good taste.
###374 Me and Louie on tour we would kind of try to take care of
###378 him and make sure he didn't get into too
###380 much trouble or anything.
###382 He was so young.
###383 He was really quiet.
###384 He never said anything.
###385 He was just this really quiet kid, with like braces.
###389 It's funny, like he was really shy.
###391 Girls always wanted to talk to him, and
###394 like hug him and stuff.
###395 He was just like this adorable little kid, and like he was
###398 just so shy, and like he didn't really-- and it was all
###402 really new to him, just being sponsored and traveling.
###404 You could tell he was a mature kid.
###406 He wasn't like just some spaz.
###409 Like normally kids at that age you can tell that they don't
###412 really know how to skate yet.
###414 I mean, maybe they could do hard tricks, but they can't
###415 really skate.
###416 But Dylan could skate everything, and like skate
###420 really well.
###421 Like, we liked him a lot right away.
###422 We really liked his skating.
###424 DYLAN RIEDER: When Osiris came out with the Subject to Change
###427 video, I shared a part with "the Butcher".
###431 I was excited, it was the first video I was filming for.
###436 I was like 15, 14.
###441 When I was that age all I really did was like skate
###443 rails and stuff.
###445 
###447 GREG HUNT: He kind of got labeled as like a little rail
###449 kid, because that's all he was really skating was rails.
###453 Once again, seeing a little kid in the beginning.
###456 He thinks one way, and then he gets
###458 influenced by someone else.
###459 He really got influenced with Tony T and those guys.
###462 And Tony was, I think, a big influence with him, and so was
###465 Donnie Barley.
###466 And those guys, what kind of set them apart, was their
###469 being able to skate tranny.
###470 It really hit him, and I think the way he looked at skating
###475 bowls, and skating tranny.
###477 And, like I actually made him enter the first contest.
###481 And he did pretty bad.
###482 And then he went back the second year, and he actually
###485 got 13th place, which is pretty gnarly for Marseilles.
###489 This was actually that one he rode in Marseilles.
###493 That was the one where he got 13th place.
###496 That was pretty gnarly, stoked on out.
###498 INTERVIEWER: That was an Am contest?
###499 MARK OBLOW: No, it was pro.
###501 It was pro, that was when he did, and that was before
###504 anyone, I mean, I saw doing them was the no-comply
###507 tail-side reverts.
###509 He did that in there, in one of his runs.
###512 And then he did like, there was a wall, a vert wall, and
###515 he did like, kick flip front side wall rides, and kick flip
###518 backside wall rides, but like super high and popping.
###521 He was skating more like, doing more
###523 technical and flip stuff.
###524 It was good, I think, it was just good for him to like
###527 break out of the little rail kid deal.
###532 JERRY HSU: After all the Osiris stuff, I would just
###536 kind of see him around.
###537 I didn't see him for years, and then he just grew up.
###539 I guess I feel kind of like proud.
###542 It's not like I played like a big part in his life, or
###544 anything, but it was just cool to see him go from like a
###547 little kid to just like a full blown, like totally well
###551 respected skater.
###553 INTERVIEWER: Are you psyched to be in another episode?
###556 DYLAN RIEDER: Yeah, I feel like it's good that I make my
###563 cameo every three or four episodes.
###565 That's good.
###566 INTERVIEWER: You're in the [INAUDIBLE] for no reason.
###568 DYLAN RIEDER: Yeah like--
###570 INTERVIEWER: [INAUDIBLE] occasionally pan over to you
###573 [INAUDIBLE]
###573 DYLAN RIEDER: Yeah, Yeah, I don't know, that day I just
###576 felt like being in an episode.
###578
