###5 SHANE SMITH NARRATING: We first met Ben Anderson when we
###7 started VBS, actually.
###9 We went to Spike Jonze, our creative director's, house
###12 along with some of the most talented editors and shooters
###15 and talent that Spike had put together.
###18 All we did was watch Ben Anderson footage from Africa,
###22 North Korea-- which I then ripped off when I went to
###24 North Korea--
###25 Iran, Iraq.
###26 It was just fascinating stuff.
###28 He ended up getting in a fight and Johnny Knoxville had to go
###31 save him and sneak him into a club.
###34 And since then, we've been wanting to work with Ben, and
###36 we knew that he had been working in Afghanistan for the
###39 past three years on making a documentary there.
###41 And lately, Afghanistan's been in the news.
###43 And you know, we're spending more and more money there.
###47 We're losing more and more ground.
###49 And generally what we've found with VBS is what you hear the
###51 mainstream media versus what is actually happening are two
###55 completely different things.
###56 So what he showed us blew our minds.
###58 I mean, it's completely insane.
###60 And it's also very complex.
###61 So we wanted him to come over and explain to us what we're
###65 about to see.
###66 
###84 BRITISH SOLDIER: You'll want to keep the bottles.
###86 You can fill the bottles up using either stream water, or
###89 when you go into compound from the well.
###91 Yeah, this is normally confusion.
###92 They all gather round.
###94 He wants a lot of water for himself, and he says he's
###96 going to sort it out, but if you give it to him, he'll just
###98 fuck off with the lot.
###99 So nothing would get sorted out.
###101 He'll just fill his vehicle and noone will get none.
###104 So you have to sort it out between them.
###106 Like kids.
###107 SHANE SMITH NARRATING: That guy's the British Army and the
###109 other guys are--?
###111 BEN ANDERSON NARRATING: Afghan National Army.
###112 SHANE SMITH NARRATING: Afghan National Army.
###113 BEN ANDERSON NARRATING: And that's
###114 basically our exit strategy.
###115 The idea is when these guys can stand up and provide
###118 security on their own, we can all get out.
###121 SHANE SMITH NARRATING: But they can't even give them
###122 water without them taking it away.
###124 SHANE SMITH NARRATING: No, they can't even get them to
###125 wear their helmets and flak jackets.
###128 BEN ANDERSON: Seems like quite a chaotic start, then.
###130 BRITISH SOLDIER: This is good.
###131 BEN ANDERSON: Is it?
###132 BRITISH SOLDIER: This is fucking squared away.
###135 They've got vehicles and everything.
###137 It's well done.
###139 BEN ANDERSON: How difficult is it to organize these guys?
###142 BRITISH SOLDIER: It just takes a bit of time.
###143 They're all mad.
###143 They all want to go on the mission, but they're not fully
###146 functioning yet.
###147 They need us to mentor them and make sure they've got all
###148 the kit and equipment they need.
###150 They'll go without water and without food and
###151 hope for the best.
###153 They think we can manage--
###154 magic things up, just invent things and produce a fuel
###157 truck for them.
###158 But we can't.
###159 When we come into contact with the enemy, sometimes you need
###163 to put them on a lead and hold them back, 'cause they'll just
###165 go and go and go until they kill more and more Taliban.
###167 That's what they want to do.
###168 That's what their life is.
###170 SHANE SMITH NARRATING: So I know there's problems in
###171 Pakistan with Muslim fighting Muslim.
###174 Why would the ANA fight the Taliban?
###178 BEN ANDERSON NARRATING: I think to them, it's work.
###179 It's not ideology at all.
###182 And there's an old saying--
###183 I think you can hire an Afghan army, but you
###185 can never buy one.
###186 SHANE SMITH NARRATING: Right.
###187 BEN ANDERSON NARRATING: So loyalty is
###187 never taken for granted.
###189 BRITISH SOLDIER: They are excited and
###190 they are brave soldiers.
###191 And they're like children.
###194 Their attention span doesn't last very long.
###197 They soon get bored.
###199 At the moment, I think they're all here.
###202 Clint Eastwood is.
###203 BEN ANDERSON: In the cowboy hat?
###205 MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.
###205 BEN ANDERSON: How you doing?
###207 Have you given up on making them wear uniform exactly the
###211 way they're supposed to wear it?
###212 BRITISH SOLDIER: No, I don't care.
###213 As long as they go and do the job and do what they're told
###215 and they toe the line.
###215 You know, they enjoy wearing their shemaghs and t-shirts
###217 and looking like Rambo when they go out.
###220 I'm not bothered.
###220 As long as they've got their weapon, their ammunition, all
###222 the stuff they need to sustain themselves, I'm not bothered.
###225 BRITISH SOLDIER: They're so--
###228 so bright and colorful, all of them.
###230 It's a wonderful sight, really.
###232 They're a very sort of visual army.
###234 It's great.
###236 
###238 BEN ANDERSON NARRATING: So in the past, the problem and the
###240 criticism has always been that the Brits, Americans, whoever
###243 it is, just control towns or bases, and they're isolated.
###247 Isolated from the community, and the Taliban can roll
###249 around freely in the rest of the country, apart
###251 from these big bases.
###253 The aim of this mission was to actually clear ground of the
###255 Taliban and then hold on to it for the first time, actually
###258 keep hold of that land and stop the
###259 Taliban from coming back.
###261 
###264 BRITISH SOLDIER: With this amount of manpower, we should
###266 have enough, tomorrow, to commit to a good scrap with
###269 the enemy if they choose to take on with us.
###272 We aim to destroy the enemy and take the ground this time,
###275 and not cede it again.
###277 BRITISH SOLDIER: If they can get forward, destroy the
###279 Taliban, and hold that ground, it's a massive morale booster
###282 for the ANA and for our boys.
###283 So, you know, that's what we're
###284 looking forward to doing.
###285 
###293 BEN ANDERSON: Did they know exactly where they were going?
###295 BRITISH SOLDIER: They know the general region, yeah, because
###297 they have to know.
###297 But we try and keep security to a minimum so we can--
###301 otherwise they'll get on the mobile phone, start phoning
###303 everyone around the [INAUDIBLE] they know, and
###304 then they'll pass it on to the Taliban.
###306 BEN ANDERSON: So there's a worry that some of the solders
###308 might intentionally be giving information to the Taliban?
###310 BRITISH SOLDIER: Yeah, people have been caught out
###311 before in the ANA.
###312 And they've been disciplined in their own chain.
###314 BEN ANDERSON: And remained within the ANA?
###316 BRITISH SOLDIER: No, they've been kicked out of the ANA.
###317 They probably went and joined the Taliban, but.
###321 SHANE SMITH NARRATING: The ANA, the Afghan National Army,
###324 they can't tell them where they're going because they'll
###326 call the Taliban and let them know?
###327 BEN ANDERSON NARRATING: And tell them where they're going,
###329 what the plan is.
###329 SHANE SMITH NARRATING: Why in god's name would they do that?
###331 BEN ANDERSON NARRATING: Because the Taliban pay much
###332 better salary than any government job-- police, army,
###336 whatever it is.
###337 SHANE SMITH NARRATING: So they pay them, and then they say,
###339 oh, we're coming here now.
###341 Kill us.
###341 BEN ANDERSON NARRATING: Yeah.
###343 So this is what all of Helmand is like, just desert.
###347 But then the area where the fighting is, is called the
###349 green zone.
###350 And completely opposite to the Iraq green zone, it's the most
###352 dangerous place, because it's the one fertile strip of land
###355 there, and there are so many hiding places for the Taliban
###357 that that's where they love to fight.
###358 And that's where the British and the ANA have to go looking
###361 for the Taliban.
###363 SHANE SMITH NARRATING: Green zone, bad zone.
###364 BEN ANDERSON: Yeah.
###366 BRITISH SOLDIER: They've watched us so far, last hour
###368 and a half, two hours.
###369 BEN ANDERSON: Everyone knows we're here?
###370 BRITISH SOLDIER: Yeah.
###371 They knew there was an upcoming, because they're used
###374 to it, and they'd have gone, right, OK.
###376 Seeing us go that way, Taliban go that way to
###380 their fall-back positions.
###383 And it's a waiting game.
###385 We'll outnumber them, we'll out-firepower them.
###387 And they know that.
###388 And they will stand and fight sooner or later, because
###390 they'll have to.
###391 Because that's what they do.
###393 BEN ANDERSON NARRATING: The Taliban have got a really
###394 sophisticated network of dickers.
###396 It's a phrase that comes from Northern Island.
###398 Local people with mobile phones, as soon as they see
###400 us, as soon as they see the soldiers coming, they'll tell
###402 them exactly our movement.
###403 So the Brits take it for granted the Taliban know their
###406 every movement.
###409 You see us walking through this town, and
###411 it's completely deserted.
###413 That's-- every single time we got ambushed,
###414 this happened first.
###415 You'd walk around, completely deserted.
###417 Because the civilians are very streetwise.
###419 They know where the Taliban are.
###420 They see the British soldiers coming.
###422 They know there's going to be a fight.
###423 So they get out of there.
###424 So as soon as you find an area that's deserted, you know
###427 there's going to be fighting.
###429 BRITISH SOLDIER: All these compounds make up
###431 the village of Kakara.
###433 We're just clearing through them.
###435 It's a painstaking process.
###437 Did you expect it to be this quiet?
###440 BRITISH SOLDIER: It swings around about.
###441 Sometimes it is this quiet.
###442 
###445 Other times you might meet one or two people.
###448 By and large, because this area has seen quite a bit of
###451 fighting over the last couple of months, a lot of the
###453 families have moved out.
###455 But hopefully after the next couple of days, we will have
###458 taken this area properly, secured it, and sent a message
###465 that people can move back into their compounds.
###467 
###469 SHANE SMITH NARRATING: Is that poppy, right there?
###471 BEN ANDERSON NARRATING: Yeah.
###471 Everywhere you go.
###472 I mean, without exaggeration, just about every single house
###476 we went into had a pile of harvested opium poppies as
###479 tall as you.
###481 Over 90% of our heroin, Britain's heroin, comes from
###483 Afghanistan.
###486 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE ON RADIO]
###487 
###492 BEN ANDERSON: The Afghan National Army can use their
###493 radios to get on the same channel as the Taliban and
###496 listen to what they're saying.
###500 What are they saying?
###501 MALE SPEAKER: They're saying they are about to attack.
###503 They are getting ready for attack, to attack us.
###506 BEN ANDERSON: Attack us here?
###507 MALE SPEAKER: Yes.
###508 BEN ANDERSON: Do you know where they are?
###510 MALE SPEAKER: No.
###510 Their location is not known.
###513 Just they are asking where [INAUDIBLE] located, where
###515 that relocating in the morning.
###517 
###521 SHANE SMITH NARRATING: He's saying that he knows that the
###524 Taliban are going to attack you right then.
###525 BEN ANDERSON NARRATING: Yeah.
###526 SHANE SMITH NARRATING: Were you scared?
###528 BEN ANDERSON NARRATING: Yeah, you're scared, but you get
###530 used to it very quickly.
###531 This is everyday life for these guys out there.
###533 SHANE SMITH NARRATING: How does he know the Taliban know?
###534 BEN ANDERSON NARRATING: He's just got a normal CB and he
###536 finds the same channel the Taliban are speaking on.
###538 He hears them saying, OK, I can see them, as soon as they
###540 come out of that street, as soon as they come from behind
###542 that wall, we'll attack.
###544 SHANE SMITH NARRATING: Jesus Christ.
###545 
###548 BEN ANDERSON: Are they close?
###550 MALE SPEAKER: Yes.
###551 
###566 BEN ANDERSON NARRATING: So we'd walked through the entire
###567 town, cleared the whole town.
###569 Really surprised not to see any civilians, any Taliban.
###572 And almost the last building we could see, there's a team
###575 of Taliban waiting there to fire up on us.
###577 So as happens every single time, the fight happens where
###580 they want it to happen.
###582 BRITISH SOLDIER: Possible positive identification of two
###584 times Taliban.
###585 We're going to engage with RPGs, see if it provokes a
###587 response, and if so, assault that enemy possession.
###589 Over.
###590 That side.
###591 OK, get the RPG up there, yeah?
###594 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###600 BEN ANDERSON NARRATING: This guy lived for
###601 firing these RPGs.
###602 BEN ANDERSON: So we think it's a sighting of two Taliban.
###605 And apparently what they'll often do is send foot patrol
###607 down to harass, then run away and lure British forces into a
###610 trap where they can be attacked by 360 degrees.
###614 Just wait and see if there's a response to the RPG that's
###617 just been fire.
###618 They're loading another one now.
###619 BEN ANDERSON NARRATING: Yeah you get a lot of stuff about
###621 how our poor soldiers are getting bogged
###622 down in this quagmire.
###624 And the Brits know exactly what's going on,
###627 and go ahead anyway.
###627 SHANE SMITH NARRATING: Right.
###628 Why?
###629 BEN ANDERSON NARRATING: Well, they're quite happy to go
###630 there and have a fight with them.
###631 They know they're walking into a trap, but
###635 they're looking for it.
###637 [RPG FIRE]
###642 MALE SPEAKER: [SHOUTING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###643 [MISSILE FIRE]
###646 BRITISH SOLDIER: Sixer alpha, sixer alpha, that's us now
###648 being engaged by RPG and small arms from kilo.
###651 If you could put air on that, that'd be lovely.
###653 Over.
###655 
###658 [GUNFIRE]
###659 BRITISH SOLDIER: Whoa.
###661 Where the fuck are they coming from?
###664 BRITISH SOLDIER: I'm stuck.
###665 
###668 [GUNFIRE]
###670 BRITISH SOLDIER: Six three alph--
###671 six three alpha, that's enemy trying to move, as I said, to
###675 the north of our current position.
###677 [GUNFIRE]
###677 BRITISH SOLDIER: They're trying to [INAUDIBLE].
###680 push forward [INAUDIBLE].
###683 Over.
###684 
###695 BRITISH SOLDIER: Message on the icon chatter said they
###696 were going to send their friends.
###698 So what I'm thinking is probably happening is that the
###700 original four Taliban are trying to push forward to the
###702 compound that's 50 meters just to our right, and that the
###705 friends are the ones who are now off in
###707 that hedge line there.
###708 [GUNFIRE]
###720 BEN ANDERSON: So is it [INAUDIBLE]?
###723 BRITISH SOLDIER: No, that's stuff coming into us.
###726 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###728 SHANE SMITH NARRATING: Now they're shooting at you there,
###729 so you're encircled now, then?
###731 BEN ANDERSON NARRATING: Yeah.
###731 They were paying attention to a small team round the corner
###734 to our right.
###734 Suddenly other teams have arrived, firing straight at
###738 us, making the wall that we're hiding behind useless.
###741 [GUNFIRE]
###742 BEN ANDERSON: I think the Taliban are a lot closer than
###746 they thought.
###747 
###757 BRITISH SOLDIER (SHOUTING): You're going to compound half
###758 right here.
###759 Alpha and Bravo are going to go and assault that compound.
###762 You have 60 meters of open ground, possible enemy in the
###765 compound, and we'll just clear through with squads of ANA.
###769 [RPG FIRE]
###776 [GUNFIRE AND RPG FIRE]
###778 BRITISH SOLDIER: Right.
###779 Stay right in.
###779 Stay right in there.
###782 [GUNFIRE AND RPG FIRE]
###784 BRITISH SOLDIER: Just coming straight in--
###785 BEN ANDERSON: That was the Apache, wasn't it?
###787 
###792 BEN ANDERSON NARRATING: We're all looking ahead to the area
###794 of the hedgerow where the Taliban were
###795 shooting at us from.
###796 Helicopter comes over.
###797 We hear the explosions, but there's no smoke.
###800 Look to our left, and the field next
###801 to us has been strafed.
###803 SHANE SMITH NARRATING: So they're strafing you and not
###804 the Taliban?
###804 BEN ANDERSON NARRATING: Not us, but very close to us.
###806 Too, too close to us.
###807 They're nowhere near the Taliban.
###809 SHANE SMITH NARRATING: Situation
###809 Normal All Fucked Up.
###811 BEN ANDERSON NARRATING: Yeah.
###812 [GUNFIRE]
###828 [EXPLOSION]
###843 BEN ANDERSON: The helicopter was calling for a strike.
###845 We thought it was the compound over here somewhere where the
###848 Taliban were fighting from.
###849 Instead it looks like they hit this compound here, where
###852 Patty and some ANA soldiers were.
###854 [RPG FIRE]
###856 BEN ANDERSON: I'm waiting.
###859 BEN ANDERSON NARRATING: We're already nervous about the
###860 helicopter, because they've watched this happen.
###862 And again, no smoke rises from the Taliban positions.
###864 I look around the corner and see that the compound that
###867 some of the Brits and Afghans have stormed has been hit by
###870 the Hellfire missile.
###871 SHANE SMITH NARRATING: So they bombed your own guys.
###872 BEN ANDERSON NARRATING: Yeah.
###874 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###892 BEN ANDERSON NARRATING: We then decided to go to the
###893 building, and we thought we were going to see
###895 six corpses in there.
###899 [GUNFIRE]
###905 BRITISH SOLDIER: [INAUDIBLE]
###908 BRITISH SOLDIER: Ready?
###910 BRITISH SOLDIER: Wait, wait.
###911 
###917 [GUNFIRE]
###924 BRITISH SOLDIER: We're going to get back to that compound
###925 over there as soon as we can.
###927 BRITISH SOLDIER: Go, go!
###930 BRITISH SOLDIER: Go, go!
###932 Come on!
###934 BEN ANDERSON NARRATING: We decided to run for the
###936 compound to see if there are six Afghan
###939 soldiers dead there.
###940 Some soldiers arrived to give covering fire.
###943 We come under heavy fire as we run to the compound.
###946 [MEN SHOUTING]
###951 [GUNFIRE]
###961 MALE SPEAKER: Come on!
###963 One more, one more.
###964 Good.
###967 BRITISH SOLDIER: One more Bravo [INAUDIBLE].
###970 BRITISH SOLDIER: Let's go, let's go, let's go.
###972 [GUNFIRE]
###976 BEN ANDERSON NARRATING: There's one small front door,
###978 and that's it.
###979 And we're now surrounded by the Taliban.
###981 [GUNFIRE]
###983 BEN ANDERSON: And your soldiers are all OK.
###985 
###989 BEN ANDERSON: Nobody, nobody killed.
###990 MALE SPEAKER: No.
###991 BEN ANDERSON: Nobody killed here.
###992 MALE SPEAKER: No.
###993 BEN ANDERSON: Pretty good luck.
###996 BEN ANDERSON: You found six RPGs?
###998 MALE SPEAKER: Seven.
###998 MALE SPEAKER: Seven.
###999 Shoot fire.
###1001 Taliban finished.
###1002 
###1004 BEN ANDERSON: Now the Taliban fire RPGs at us.
###1008 [MEN SHOUTING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1010 BEN ANDERSON: This compound wasn't abandoned.
###1011 There's a family behind me, with one old man and five
###1013 children, three of whom--
###1015 [EXPLOSION]
###1016 BEN ANDERSON: Two, three years old.
###1016 Absolutely terrified.
###1017 
###1020 SHANE SMITH NARRATING: So there's a family there.
###1021 The Hellfire missile came in, blew up their house, and
###1023 they're still in the house during the firefight?
###1025 BEN ANDERSON NARRATING: Yeah, yeah.
###1025 They're stuck in the house.
###1026 That was probably the most shocking thing I saw in my
###1028 entire time in Afghanistan.
###1030 These, literally, babies covered in dust, crying,
###1033 absolutely petrified.
###1035 And you can see where the missile struck.
###1037 They must have been right next to the explosion when the
###1039 missile landed.
###1040 BRITISH SOLDIER: Because there are a number of compounds
###1041 which aren't very clearly identifiable on the air
###1043 [INAUDIBLE], we called in the compound we thought we were
###1045 in, according to the GPS fixed, and obviously they
###1048 corresponded, they thought that was the
###1049 compound we were in.
###1050 So when they called the Hellfire in, it came in on
###1052 this position.
###1053 It's difficult enough when you're firing on your own
###1055 troops, let alone if you then come into the compound and
###1057 there's people who've been hiding.
###1059 But fortunately, I think everyone was all right.
###1061 There's a few slightly shaky eardrums, more
###1064 than anything else.
###1065 SHANE SMITH NARRATING: So there's only one compound with
###1066 British troops in it, and they've got that one.
###1068 BEN ANDERSON: Yeah.
###1068 Yeah.
###1069 I mean, there aren't detailed maps of this place.
###1072 And what maps they have got are a rough guide, but their
###1076 abilities aren't on map.
###1077 Their ability to look at the buildings, it's very, very
###1080 difficult, especially when you haven't got time to really
###1083 work things out.
###1085 BRITISH SOLDIER: All [INAUDIBLE]
###1085 confirmed, they're calling in strafe on
###1087 target Whiskey forward.
###1090 Sixer alpha, roger, we'll stay firm in this target location
###1093 with the grid we've given you.
###1094 I don't know what letter it is, but let's just hope it
###1096 doesn't come in us.
###1097 Over.
###1097 SHANE SMITH NARRATING: There's been two times where it comes
###1099 in on you, and now the third time he's calling it in,
###1101 saying, I hope it doesn't come in on us.
###1102 BEN ANDERSON NARRATING: Yeah.
###1103 SHANE SMITH NARRATING: I don't know what the number is.
###1104 Shoot away.
###1105 BEN ANDERSON NARRATING: Yeah.
###1105 Yeah.
###1106 Which they go on to say more and more.
###1108 They just abandon themselves to fate by the end of the day.
###1111 [GUNFIRE AND RPG FIRE]
###1118 BRITISH SOLDIER: Sixer alpha, that was spot on.
###1119 We're now observing friendly enemy movement.
###1121 Over.
###1124 BRITISH SOLDIER: They're actually terrified of the air.
###1126 The closer, the more risk you can play with, it allows us to
###1129 get even closer to the enemy.
###1130 It just means that you've got to slightly steel your nerves
###1133 for those few moments when the first rounds come in and they
###1135 might be little bit close.
###1136 But it's all fun and games, so.
###1137
