###0 model carman russell gave a really interesting ted talk about how she's
###5 been extremely beautiful model and because of that she often gets things
###9 that she doesn't deserve okay so it's really really difficult for a woman to
###14 come forward and say that because oftentimes people will criticize you for
###17 that they'll say all you're just getting all these great uh... opportunities in
###22 life because you're beautiful but there's not much more to it uh... and
###25 and she's completely honest about that in fact let's watch a little snippet up
###29 here to talk
###30 i want to genetic lottery
###31 and i and the recipient of a legacy
###33 frick the past few centuries we have defined beauty west tall slender figures
###39 and femininity
###41 and white skin and this is a legacy that was built for me and it's a legacy that
###45 i've been cashing out on
###48 so she makes a ruling simply it you know
###52 there are certain things that we get the biologically respond to in terms of
###55 purity so symmetry is one of them health
###58 uh... and honestly being young right
###61 slender has not missile had been part of that equation abut over the last however
###66 many years in modern times it has
###70 become a part of the equation because of societal expectations of saturn
###74 shes like and genetically i happen to be skinny
###76 so i went a lottery even device in the one
###79 and i happen to be tall and paul was in the silly
###82 part of our d_n_a_ that were attracted to twelve women but for whatever reason
###86 in the modeling world
###87 and it's mainly because they want to close to hang offer them in you know
###91 at that's
###92 uh... she winds up already has made a point com
###96 race that i thought was really interesting yes
###98 she says look you know you have a tire banks in the army and and all the stuff
###102 in
###103 although you know the white did to succeed in modeling suspect them of the
###107 problems
###108 only four percent of them are minority and not letting you know that that's
###112 amazing unalloyed that's actually based on to say that was done by then why u
###115 p_h_d_
###116 uh... this as didn't look at six hundred seventy seven models that were hired
###121 in the year two thousand seven and only four percent of them outward not not
###126 white
###127 stunningly six percent white now
###129 while cell obviously this astonishing within the modeling community but also
###134 really want to
###135 giver props for it you know
###138 in many something that's not be easy to admit it's hard to do that and by the
###141 way she's really intelligent she graduated from columbia uh... any
###145 graduates from colombia and any division is really smart
###149 uh... but if you listen to her whole tent auctions extreme really articulate
###153 very intelligent popping your you could tell she's hard working but nobody
###156 notices any of that because the first thing that they notice
###159 is the way that she looks and she says it's unfair because you know she gets
###163 her ted talk begets millions of hits but you know colin powell said talked into
###167 you as well and she's like why is it the people are more interested to hear what
###171 amato has to say as opposed to what someone like colin powell has to say and
###176 i think that that's very symbolic of what our society is into oftentimes we
###180 get heat for covering so-called celebrity stories when we come in
###184 celebrity stories because you guys and loving you guys love to click on it you
###187 leg as left a comment on it no decided one day we can we try to put
###192 are stamp on it meaning that we don't cover like every other cigarette if
###195 there was a slight reserves like it
###198 did you see cardiac she's misled it whereas in whatever we do correction we
###204 try to have a point
###205 rate we try to have
###207 the reason why we're trying to make a point about society culture et cetera
###211 maybe we don't always succeed but let's work going for but but you can
###215 we fall prey to the correct article it was really interesting
###218 and she mentioned colin powell specific because that is to give a speech the
###221 same time and she got four times the number of users that are now there are
###225 other factors you see colin powell often is a but you know what happened
###229 by some of those
###230 we got here on the show
###231 when i was a great worry if you don't ship
###234 because you know and i think he's right now is that they had so much is that i
###238 think that
###240 instinct was
###242 it'll be an interesting guess this is really smart and has a really
###245 interesting point plus she's super hot keep it real ight now right
###250 yes please
###251 into any such as the hotness to it said
###254 he's
###255 the category we wouldn't expect
###257 you know ice expect of a
###259 political conversation or interesting cultural conversation from
###263 someone from the nation or alternet or
###266 political figure but since it's a model since there for
###269 right right yes it is leasing a quandary two sec
###272 do i accept all these offers
###275 when it's kind of unfair that they're asking me why they should be asking more
###278 qualified people i don't think that without a doubt she should accept the
###281 offers and one huge misconception is that
###285 people were attracted get these great opportunities right
###287 but oftentimes when it's a real substantive opportunity let's say like
###292 co hosting a show for instance rain okay you can get hired based on your lucks
###296 but your intellect is what heating going that's what keeps you on michelle you
###300 can't be a moron in costa show emulate cut too much better okay get man but you
###306 know what i mean like oftentimes people get those accusations if yours if you're
###310 a cable to handle whatever the job that is take it and your abilities will help
###315 you pursue whatever that is uh... some no not and i've always thought that have
###319 been
###320 in august kind of obvious that people hired me for my looks
###325 and so you know what i'm i think i ever did over these years together doctor so
