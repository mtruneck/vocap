0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:8,568



2
0:0:8,568 --> 0:0:9,57
REIHAN SALAM: Hi.


3
0:0:9,57 --> 0:0:10,46
I'm Reihan.


4
0:0:10,46 --> 0:0:12,72
And I'm here in Los
Angeles with Vice.


5
0:0:12,72 --> 0:0:18,44
And I'm about to meet Larry
Flynt, pornographer, rebel


6
0:0:18,44 --> 0:0:23,93
godless heathen, political
activist, and so much more.


7
0:0:23,93 --> 0:0:25,18
Let's go.


8
0:0:25,18 --> 0:0:32,87



9
0:0:32,87 --> 0:0:35,83
Mr. Flynt, thanks so much for
inviting us into your office.


10
0:0:35,83 --> 0:0:37,26
It's incredibly generous
of you.


11
0:0:37,26 --> 0:0:38,8
LARRY FLYNT: All right.


12
0:0:38,8 --> 0:0:38,49
Thank you.


13
0:0:38,49 --> 0:0:41,81
REIHAN SALAM: I wanted to ask
you, was there a moment when


14
0:0:41,81 --> 0:0:45,5
you were a kid when you decided
that you were destined


15
0:0:45,5 --> 0:0:46,525
for extraordinary things?


16
0:0:46,525 --> 0:0:49,87
LARRY FLYNT: I was about 10
years old, and I was standing


17
0:0:49,87 --> 0:0:54,492
on a swinging bridge across the
river in Eastern Kentucky.


18
0:0:54,492 --> 0:0:56,2
You don't understand,
our biggest


19
0:0:56,2 --> 0:0:59,16
industry was jury duty.


20
0:0:59,16 --> 0:1:1,99
You couldn't get
a job anywhere.


21
0:1:1,99 --> 0:1:8,292
And I just felt there was
more to the world


22
0:1:8,292 --> 0:1:10,89
than where I was living.


23
0:1:10,89 --> 0:1:16,4
I felt I wanted to be wealthy
because I was so poor then.


24
0:1:16,4 --> 0:1:20,98
I felt that success was
measured by money.


25
0:1:20,98 --> 0:1:24,35
Now I realize that success
is not measured


26
0:1:24,35 --> 0:1:25,395
by what you've got.


27
0:1:25,395 --> 0:1:29,1
But it's measured by the
obstacles you had to overcome


28
0:1:29,1 --> 0:1:31,845
in order to achieve it.


29
0:1:31,845 --> 0:1:33,995
REIHAN SALAM: Was there a
particular person when you


30
0:1:33,995 --> 0:1:37,48
were 10 who inspired you, or
someone who came from the


31
0:1:37,48 --> 0:1:40,78
outside world, someone who gave
you a bigger sense of the


32
0:1:40,78 --> 0:1:42,17
world outside of Eastern
Kentucky?


33
0:1:42,17 --> 0:1:46,91
LARRY FLYNT: My role models were
really world leaders and


34
0:1:46,91 --> 0:1:51,97
politicians and people like
that, rather than actors.


35
0:1:51,97 --> 0:1:58,722
I was influenced a great deal
by President Kennedy.


36
0:1:58,722 --> 0:2:2,13
REIHAN SALAM: Kennedy is a guy
who grew up in great privilege


37
0:2:2,13 --> 0:2:5,28
and someone who, I suppose you
could say, used that privilege


38
0:2:5,28 --> 0:2:7,67
to go into public service and
devote himself to a larger


39
0:2:7,67 --> 0:2:8,96
cause than himself.


40
0:2:8,96 --> 0:2:12,34
But I wonder why it was Kennedy
who sparked that


41
0:2:12,34 --> 0:2:15,54
enthusiasm in you, given that he
came from a very different


42
0:2:15,54 --> 0:2:16,645
kind of background.


43
0:2:16,645 --> 0:2:20,75
LARRY FLYNT: I don't have a good
answer for that, other


44
0:2:20,75 --> 0:2:23,13
than when he would speak, I
used to get goose pimples.


45
0:2:23,13 --> 0:2:27,0
JOHN F. KENNEDY: Before this
decade is out of landing a man


46
0:2:27,0 --> 0:2:30,28
on the moon and returning
him safely to the earth.


47
0:2:30,28 --> 0:2:34,466
LARRY FLYNT: I always thought
he was so profound.


48
0:2:34,466 --> 0:2:38,12
REIHAN SALAM: I would love to
know, the Obama presidency


49
0:2:38,12 --> 0:2:40,75
began with tremendous
enthusiasm.


50
0:2:40,75 --> 0:2:43,71
And I wonder, as someone who
is a great devotee of


51
0:2:43,71 --> 0:2:46,2
President Kennedy, do you think
that President Obama has


52
0:2:46,2 --> 0:2:48,725
proved to be up to snuff?


53
0:2:48,725 --> 0:2:52,835
LARRY FLYNT: I think President
Obama has overperformed.


54
0:2:52,835 --> 0:2:55,57



55
0:2:55,57 --> 0:3:0,526
I know this has become a cliche,
but it's so true.


56
0:3:0,526 --> 0:3:7,27
He got handed on his platter
when he became president more


57
0:3:7,27 --> 0:3:12,9
than any president in history
ever had to deal with.


58
0:3:12,9 --> 0:3:15,11
I'm just amazed he's--


59
0:3:15,11 --> 0:3:17,97
Sure, he hasn't done
everything perfect.


60
0:3:17,97 --> 0:3:20,0
He made a few mistakes
along the way.


61
0:3:20,0 --> 0:3:27,75
But he did a marvelous job.


62
0:3:27,75 --> 0:3:31,16
REIHAN SALAM: When you say he's
overperformed, is there a


63
0:3:31,16 --> 0:3:33,91
particular quality that
he has that you think


64
0:3:33,91 --> 0:3:34,8
accounts for that?


65
0:3:34,8 --> 0:3:37,69
LARRY FLYNT: I see him and Jack
Kennedy have the same


66
0:3:37,69 --> 0:3:40,375
intellect, in terms
of being smart.


67
0:3:40,375 --> 0:3:43,23



68
0:3:43,23 --> 0:3:44,69
That's been his best asset.


69
0:3:44,69 --> 0:3:49,64
But now you don't understand
that when he was trying to do


70
0:3:49,64 --> 0:3:53,5
business with the Republicans
on the deficit and the debt


71
0:3:53,5 --> 0:3:56,98
ceiling and all that kind of
stuff, he was just one man


72
0:3:56,98 --> 0:4:1,99
fighting everybody to
try and get a deal.


73
0:4:1,99 --> 0:4:3,29
REIHAN SALAM: Did you
ever think that


74
0:4:3,29 --> 0:4:4,51
you'd go into politics?


75
0:4:4,51 --> 0:4:5,96
Did you ever think you'd
run for office?


76
0:4:5,96 --> 0:4:7,27
LARRY FLYNT: No.


77
0:4:7,27 --> 0:4:10,67
But I've always been fascinated
with politics.


78
0:4:10,67 --> 0:4:18,93
And I actually think that I know
more than most people do


79
0:4:18,93 --> 0:4:22,46
about the political status
of our nation.


80
0:4:22,46 --> 0:4:25,34
REIHAN SALAM: You recently
announced a


81
0:4:25,34 --> 0:4:28,88
challenge, a bounty.


82
0:4:28,88 --> 0:4:30,47
Can you tell us a little
bit about that?


83
0:4:30,47 --> 0:4:33,92
LARRY FLYNT: Well, in every
presidential cycle for the


84
0:4:33,92 --> 0:4:37,21
last 30 years, we've run a full
page ad in the Washington


85
0:4:37,21 --> 0:4:43,63
Post where we offer a $1 million
reward for anyone that


86
0:4:43,63 --> 0:4:48,36
can provide information
on their politicians.


87
0:4:48,36 --> 0:4:49,715
REIHAN SALAM: Have you
paid out the $1


88
0:4:49,715 --> 0:4:50,71
million in the past?


89
0:4:50,71 --> 0:4:51,37
LARRY FLYNT: Oh yes.


90
0:4:51,37 --> 0:4:52,46
We've had a number
of different--


91
0:4:52,46 --> 0:4:55,12
Sometimes they've had to split
it up because there've been


92
0:4:55,12 --> 0:4:57,2
more sources than one.


93
0:4:57,2 --> 0:5:0,8
There is nothing that will
change someone's moral outlook


94
0:5:0,8 --> 0:5:4,46
more than cash in large sums.


95
0:5:4,46 --> 0:5:6,75
REIHAN SALAM: Indeed.


96
0:5:6,75 --> 0:5:9,54
LARRY FLYNT: And I don't think
that because you pay for


97
0:5:9,54 --> 0:5:13,632
information that it's
any less credible.


98
0:5:13,632 --> 0:5:15,53
REIHAN SALAM: You're not just
a political activist.


99
0:5:15,53 --> 0:5:19,38
You're also are someone who
built a mammoth, innovative


100
0:5:19,38 --> 0:5:20,85
publishing empire.


101
0:5:20,85 --> 0:5:23,84
And I wonder what was
the innovation?


102
0:5:23,84 --> 0:5:25,42
What was your key insight?


103
0:5:25,42 --> 0:5:30,99
LARRY FLYNT: I was successful
not because of what I did, but


104
0:5:30,99 --> 0:5:33,9
in spite of what I did.


105
0:5:33,9 --> 0:5:36,59
I did not know the publishing
business.


106
0:5:36,59 --> 0:5:38,82
I just knew that I
read magazines


107
0:5:38,82 --> 0:5:40,79
like Playboy and Penthouse.


108
0:5:40,79 --> 0:5:43,56
I had a chain of clubs
in the Midwest.


109
0:5:43,56 --> 0:5:45,52
And somebody said, why
don't you do a club


110
0:5:45,52 --> 0:5:48,172
like Playboy did?


111
0:5:48,172 --> 0:5:55,27
So I looked at the magazines,
and I just realized, hey, if


112
0:5:55,27 --> 0:5:57,89
they want to know which
car to buy,


113
0:5:57,89 --> 0:5:59,3
they'll buy another magazine.


114
0:5:59,3 --> 0:6:1,79
If they want to know how to
make some perfect martini,


115
0:6:1,79 --> 0:6:5,29
they can find out from
a local bartender.


116
0:6:5,29 --> 0:6:9,42
They really wanted to know about
girls, and they want to


117
0:6:9,42 --> 0:6:11,38
see pretty women.


118
0:6:11,38 --> 0:6:14,83
And that's more or less
a philosophy that


119
0:6:14,83 --> 0:6:16,495
I applied to Hustler.


120
0:6:16,495 --> 0:6:20,29
It's that if you look at
Playboy, it's obvious that


121
0:6:20,29 --> 0:6:24,955
Hefner likes blonds with big
boobs, Amazon-type girls.


122
0:6:24,955 --> 0:6:28,63
You look at Hustler, you
don't know what I like.


123
0:6:28,63 --> 0:6:30,25
Small, medium, large.


124
0:6:30,25 --> 0:6:33,84
We have brunettes, redheads,
blondes, whatever.


125
0:6:33,84 --> 0:6:35,54
It's the girl next door look.


126
0:6:35,54 --> 0:6:38,339
You might see a girl in Hustler
who reminds you of a


127
0:6:38,339 --> 0:6:40,326
girl you've seen at the
laundromat or something.


128
0:6:40,326 --> 0:6:44,26
REIHAN SALAM: What was the
initial inspiration to go into


129
0:6:44,26 --> 0:6:47,43
opening these clubs and sort of
basically going into this


130
0:6:47,43 --> 0:6:49,608
business of--


131
0:6:49,608 --> 0:6:53,47
LARRY FLYNT: Well, when I
got out of the Navy, I


132
0:6:53,47 --> 0:6:54,325
didn't have a trade.


133
0:6:54,325 --> 0:6:56,55
I didn't have a lot of
formal education.


134
0:6:56,55 --> 0:7:0,37
So the easiest business for me
to get into would be to go in


135
0:7:0,37 --> 0:7:1,73
the bar and club business.


136
0:7:1,73 --> 0:7:3,1
And that's what I did.


137
0:7:3,1 --> 0:7:6,33
And that's how I get started.


138
0:7:6,33 --> 0:7:8,53
REIHAN SALAM: Where did the
original money come from?


139
0:7:8,53 --> 0:7:10,56
Was it just your savings
from the Navy?


140
0:7:10,56 --> 0:7:13,87
LARRY FLYNT: I worked in
factories, GM factories.


141
0:7:13,87 --> 0:7:16,335
And I saved a little money.


142
0:7:16,335 --> 0:7:19,36
The first license--


143
0:7:19,36 --> 0:7:21,31
All I had was only a beer bar.


144
0:7:21,31 --> 0:7:22,72
You couldn't even
serve liquor.


145
0:7:22,72 --> 0:7:24,12
REIHAN SALAM: And this
was in Dayton?


146
0:7:24,12 --> 0:7:25,79
LARRY FLYNT: Yeah.


147
0:7:25,79 --> 0:7:31,35
And then I continued to expand
into other cities in Ohio.


148
0:7:31,35 --> 0:7:34,44
REIHAN SALAM: So in recent
years, obviously the rise of


149
0:7:34,44 --> 0:7:37,7
the internet and internet
pornography has been a huge


150
0:7:37,7 --> 0:7:38,7
challenge to a lot of those


151
0:7:38,7 --> 0:7:40,29
established publishing empires.


152
0:7:40,29 --> 0:7:43,45
And I wonder, have you ever
felt under siege by it?


153
0:7:43,45 --> 0:7:47,93
Have you ever felt like this
world you had built was really


154
0:7:47,93 --> 0:7:49,6
being shaken up?


155
0:7:49,6 --> 0:7:54,41
LARRY FLYNT: I first took notice
in the '70s, when VHS


156
0:7:54,41 --> 0:7:59,54
and Betamax came along.


157
0:7:59,54 --> 0:8:5,92
I felt that that definitely was
going to take adult movies


158
0:8:5,92 --> 0:8:7,3
into the home.


159
0:8:7,3 --> 0:8:13,4
And then in the '80s, as the
internet started becoming the


160
0:8:13,4 --> 0:8:18,55
focus, I felt the industry's
changing, and I


161
0:8:18,55 --> 0:8:20,7
better change with it.


162
0:8:20,7 --> 0:8:23,44
So I put up my first website
in the early '90s.


163
0:8:23,44 --> 0:8:26,16
REIHAN SALAM: Do you ever miss
that world of '70s, back


164
0:8:26,16 --> 0:8:29,27
before VHS and Betamax,
and adult movies


165
0:8:29,27 --> 0:8:30,98
came into the home?


166
0:8:30,98 --> 0:8:34,39
Do you ever miss that world
where people had to go to


167
0:8:34,39 --> 0:8:34,73
movie theaters and go to
the red light district?


168
0:8:34,73 --> 0:8:36,45
LARRY FLYNT: Yeah, I
miss it because it


169
0:8:36,45 --> 0:8:37,72
was a lot more simple.


170
0:8:37,72 --> 0:8:40,929



171
0:8:40,929 --> 0:8:44,41
People think the world is simple
today because you have


172
0:8:44,41 --> 0:8:46,7
all the gadgetry and the
internet and everything.


173
0:8:46,7 --> 0:8:49,26
But life was much more
simple then.


174
0:8:49,26 --> 0:8:51,95
And there's a certain
yearning.


175
0:8:51,95 --> 0:8:54,28
REIHAN SALAM: Was there a
camaraderie there in those


176
0:8:54,28 --> 0:8:57,7
clubs in Dayton and everywhere
else that you were building


177
0:8:57,7 --> 0:9:0,65
up, where people were going to
peep shows and going to adult


178
0:9:0,65 --> 0:9:2,16
movie theaters?


179
0:9:2,16 --> 0:9:6,87
Was there a spirit that you
miss in those places?


180
0:9:6,87 --> 0:9:8,19
Or is that an [INAUDIBLE]?


181
0:9:8,19 --> 0:9:10,41
LARRY FLYNT: I definitely do.


182
0:9:10,41 --> 0:9:16,34
Those are my fondest memories,
the early years with Hustler


183
0:9:16,34 --> 0:9:19,76
and building Hustler up.


184
0:9:19,76 --> 0:9:24,762
But then as I was saying, but
I continued to diversify.


185
0:9:24,762 --> 0:9:26,83
I went into the gaming
business.


186
0:9:26,83 --> 0:9:31,31
We have probably one of the
most successful casinos in


187
0:9:31,31 --> 0:9:35,71
California, about half an hour
south of LA, which is very


188
0:9:35,71 --> 0:9:36,74
profitable.


189
0:9:36,74 --> 0:9:40,2
REIHAN SALAM: There are a lot of
people who fret a lot about


190
0:9:40,2 --> 0:9:44,89
how accessible pornography is
and how the easy availability


191
0:9:44,89 --> 0:9:47,72
of pornography has really
changed relations


192
0:9:47,72 --> 0:9:49,16
between men and women.


193
0:9:49,16 --> 0:9:50,52
Do you worry about that all?


194
0:9:50,52 --> 0:9:52,32
Do you think that it's changed
things for the worse, or do


195
0:9:52,32 --> 0:9:54,1
you think it's changed things
for the better?


196
0:9:54,1 --> 0:9:56,9
LARRY FLYNT: I think it changes
it for the better.


197
0:9:56,9 --> 0:10:0,4
One thing that pornography does
that people don't realize


198
0:10:0,4 --> 0:10:2,55
is it desensitizes people.


199
0:10:2,55 --> 0:10:8,65
Because one of the biggest
problems in relationships now


200
0:10:8,65 --> 0:10:13,29
is premature ejaculation
on behalf of the man.


201
0:10:13,29 --> 0:10:17,63
Well if I'm viewing pornography
and being exposed


202
0:10:17,63 --> 0:10:23,52
to pornography, it takes that
immediate impulse away.


203
0:10:23,52 --> 0:10:28,52
And you're not as apt
to be so quick.


204
0:10:28,52 --> 0:10:31,39
REIHAN SALAM: Although I wonder,
when you were growing


205
0:10:31,39 --> 0:10:33,58
up in eastern Kentucky, say when
you were in your early


206
0:10:33,58 --> 0:10:40,68
teens, was there an excitement
around forming those early


207
0:10:40,68 --> 0:10:43,61
attachments, those early
relationships with girls that


208
0:10:43,61 --> 0:10:48,215
isn't necessarily there
for today's teenagers?


209
0:10:48,215 --> 0:10:51,46
LARRY FLYNT: Possibly they
may be a little bit more


210
0:10:51,46 --> 0:10:56,51
promiscuous today then it was
then, as the religious right


211
0:10:56,51 --> 0:10:58,16
would try to get
you to believe.


212
0:10:58,16 --> 0:11:1,94
They attribute this
to my pornography.


213
0:11:1,94 --> 0:11:3,58
REIHAN SALAM: But it's also true
that there are a lot of


214
0:11:3,58 --> 0:11:6,87
folks, a lot of feminists,
who've given you a pretty hard


215
0:11:6,87 --> 0:11:8,81
time, and who've been
very hostile.


216
0:11:8,81 --> 0:11:13,11
And I wonder, do you think that
they just have it wrong?


217
0:11:13,11 --> 0:11:16,12
LARRY FLYNT: When they would
criticize me about


218
0:11:16,12 --> 0:11:19,85
pornography, they'd say I was
exploiting women, what I was


219
0:11:19,85 --> 0:11:22,36
doing was demeaning to women.


220
0:11:22,36 --> 0:11:27,51
That's like saying that Sports
Illustrated exploits sports.


221
0:11:27,51 --> 0:11:29,31
That's what I was selling.


222
0:11:29,31 --> 0:11:34,66
I've never, ever had a woman
pose for the magazine and say


223
0:11:34,66 --> 0:11:39,1
that she was coerced into doing
it or that she felt she


224
0:11:39,1 --> 0:11:41,36
was being exploited.


225
0:11:41,36 --> 0:11:45,7
That's just the feminists
coming up


226
0:11:45,7 --> 0:11:46,925
with their own brand.


227
0:11:46,925 --> 0:11:51,6
REIHAN SALAM: There was a moment
in the late '70s when


228
0:11:51,6 --> 0:11:54,8
the evangelical movement
was really on the rise.


229
0:11:54,8 --> 0:11:56,6
And there were a lot of people,
who had never been a


230
0:11:56,6 --> 0:11:57,94
part of it, really got
drawn into it.


231
0:11:57,94 --> 0:12:0,97
And my understanding is that in
the late '70s, there was a


232
0:12:0,97 --> 0:12:4,36
moment when you yourself
embraced religion.


233
0:12:4,36 --> 0:12:5,29
Do you remember that?


234
0:12:5,29 --> 0:12:6,84
And what was it that
led you there?


235
0:12:6,84 --> 0:12:9,22
LARRY FLYNT: I got over that.


236
0:12:9,22 --> 0:12:11,1
REIHAN SALAM: What was
it though back then?


237
0:12:11,1 --> 0:12:13,27
Because you were already a
pretty successful entrepreneur


238
0:12:13,27 --> 0:12:13,87
at the time.


239
0:12:13,87 --> 0:12:19,54
LARRY FLYNT: I did have a very
profound religious experience.


240
0:12:19,54 --> 0:12:26,26
And most people, when they
have this born-again type


241
0:12:26,26 --> 0:12:30,53
experience, the average person
has nobody to talk to.


242
0:12:30,53 --> 0:12:33,373
They don't want to go to the
doctor because they don't want


243
0:12:33,373 --> 0:12:36,0
to be perceived as being
mentally ill.


244
0:12:36,0 --> 0:12:39,8
So the only thing they can do
is talk to a member of their


245
0:12:39,8 --> 0:12:41,9
family or neighbor
or something.


246
0:12:41,9 --> 0:12:43,41
And they're directed to
start going to church.


247
0:12:43,41 --> 0:12:49,585
So that way, you're already
caught up in


248
0:12:49,585 --> 0:12:51,61
the religious sect.


249
0:12:51,61 --> 0:12:56,22
But I sought out a psychiatrist
immediately after


250
0:12:56,22 --> 0:12:57,29
it happened to me.


251
0:12:57,29 --> 0:12:59,28
REIHAN SALAM: It's funny that
it led you to the doctor,


252
0:12:59,28 --> 0:13:1,82
because most people when they
feel that warmth, they would


253
0:13:1,82 --> 0:13:3,895
welcome it rather than
go to the doctor.


254
0:13:3,895 --> 0:13:7,68
LARRY FLYNT: My psychiatrist
simply told me--


255
0:13:7,68 --> 0:13:9,93
He said, we know nothing
about the brain.


256
0:13:9,93 --> 0:13:14,51
He said, even brain surgeons
don't know anything about it.


257
0:13:14,51 --> 0:13:19,5
He says, this is largely thought
to be because of a


258
0:13:19,5 --> 0:13:22,3
iodine deficiency
in your diet.


259
0:13:22,3 --> 0:13:26,82
REIHAN SALAM: Do you think that
more devoutly religious


260
0:13:26,82 --> 0:13:29,96
Americans would be less devoutly
religious if they


261
0:13:29,96 --> 0:13:30,76
just ate more salt?


262
0:13:30,76 --> 0:13:33,5
LARRY FLYNT: He showed me a
whole map of the world.


263
0:13:33,5 --> 0:13:38,0
It shows where stronger iodine
deposits were in the salts.


264
0:13:38,0 --> 0:13:42,63
And there was always a higher
degree of manic depressive


265
0:13:42,63 --> 0:13:45,53
people that lived in those
particular areas.


266
0:13:45,53 --> 0:13:48,94
So he says there's definitely
a correlation between the


267
0:13:48,94 --> 0:13:55,44
iodine in the salt and the manic
depressive and the use


268
0:13:55,44 --> 0:13:57,336
of lithium as treatment.


269
0:13:57,336 --> 0:14:0,19
REIHAN SALAM: How did that
change things, that experience


270
0:14:0,19 --> 0:14:1,4
of having faced death?


271
0:14:1,4 --> 0:14:3,54
LARRY FLYNT: Somebody asked me
once, they said, what's it


272
0:14:3,54 --> 0:14:6,32
like to be in a wheelchair
all these years?


273
0:14:6,32 --> 0:14:8,12
I said, I don't know.


274
0:14:8,12 --> 0:14:10,27
I never thought about it
until you asked me.


275
0:14:10,27 --> 0:14:13,68
I don't dwell on things I
can't do anything about.


276
0:14:13,68 --> 0:14:17,22
So that in a nutshell
tells you about the


277
0:14:17,22 --> 0:14:19,2
type of person I am.


278
0:14:19,2 --> 0:14:22,645
I don't waste time dealing
with things


279
0:14:22,645 --> 0:14:24,165
that I can't solve.


280
0:14:24,165 --> 0:16:24,165
