###17 ELLIOT BAMBROUGH: We're here in Soweto at one of the many
###20 taxi ranks that dot the landscape.
###22 That's because they're the most popular form of
###23 transportation in the townships because most people
###26 don't have the money to buy a vehicle themselves.
###28 And it gives them accessibility to places all
###30 over Johannesburg.
###30 The taxi drivers themselves have played a key and evolving
###34 role in shaping the music scene here in Soweto.
###36 But joining me for this mission is Krishna.
###39 Krishna is from Brooklyn.
###40 How ya doing?
###41 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Hey, doing great, how about you?
###42 ELLIOT BAMBROUGH: I'm doing really well, thanks.
###43 So we're going to go now and find out a little bit more
###45 about how these guys actually fit into the music scene.
###48 So tell me, what is Krishna?
###50 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Well, I'm a writer and an editor for an
###53 online-only magazine that's about death and dying.
###56 ELLIOT BAMBROUGH: An online magazine
###57 about death and dying?
###58 How big is your audience?
###59 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Well, they're all dying, so they
###60 don't even count.
###61 ELLIOT BAMBROUGH: [LAUGH]
###61 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: We don't even know, we
###62 can't even keep track.
###63 So what do you know about the music scene in Johannesburg.
###66 ELLIOT BAMBROUGH: It was born out of the townships and at
###69 the end of apartheid.
###70 So we're talking about '93, '94.
###73 The music that sprung up
###75 instantaneously was called kwaito.
###77 So to get the music to the people, and to get these
###79 people hearing this new kwaito music, the artists found the
###82 best way of doing it was by using taxi drivers.
###86 So the artists would give their demos to the taxi
###90 drivers to play in their taxis.
###93 And that's how these musicians and kwaito stars broke into
###97 the bigtime in the '90s, was via taxi drivers.
###101 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: That's amazing.
###102 ELLIOT BAMBROUGH: So rather than me going on and on about
###104 my definition of kwaito, do you actually
###106 want to hear some?
###107 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Yeah, absolutely.
###108 ELLIOT BAMBROUGH: OK, hang on, let me sync up.
###110 [MUSIC PLAYING - KWAITO]
###113 ELLIOT BAMBROUGH: So this is kwaito.
###116 And this is one of the biggest stars in kwaito.
###119 This guy's called Brickz.
###120 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Wow.
###121 ELLIOT BAMBROUGH: What do think?
###122 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: I think it's awesome.
###123 ELLIOT BAMBROUGH: Well, we are actually on our way now to go
###127 and meet Brickz.
###128 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Man, that's exciting.
###129 ELLIOT BAMBROUGH: A star of the music.
###131 So we're on our way now.
###132 [MUSIC PLAYING - KWAITO]
###159 ELLIOT BAMBROUGH: Brickz, first off, awesome
###160 performance.
###160 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Yeah, that was amazing.
###161 ELLIOT BAMBROUGH: You put a whole lot of energy into that.
###163 BRICKZ: Thanks guys, thanks guys.
###164 I try to make sure that I bring personal
###167 experiences in my music.
###169 Things that I've seen.
###170 And everything that's happens in the streets.
###172 It's more like hip-hop.
###174 People who listen to kwaito, they are mostly people who
###177 understand ghetto life.
###178 ELLIOT BAMBROUGH: And am I right in thinking that taxi
###181 drivers were the way that everyone got their music out
###184 to the people?
###185 BRICKZ: Yes, because most taxi drivers, they
###188 come from the township.
###189 And taxi drivers know how to pump a song.
###192 And each and every one who goes in and out the taxi gets
###195 to hear your song, which is good.
###198 When someone gets out of the car, he wants to go
###201 and buy that CD.
###202 And that's what you want.
###203 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Could you teach us that Mandela dance
###204 before we go?
###206 BRICKZ: [CALLING OUT IN RHYTHM]
###211 [LAUGHS]
###213 You guys rock, man.
###216 We meet at the taxi ranks.
###218 
###223 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: We're at Bara taxi rank in Soweto.
###225 It's one of the largest taxi stands in the city.
###229 
###250 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Oh, you turn up the music at
###252 1:00 for the kids.
###252 ELLIOT BAMBROUGH: The kids like it louder.
###253 Yeah, that makes sense.
###254 
###263 ELLIOT BAMBROUGH: Are there drivers that people know--
###264 I have to go in his taxi because I know that I'll hear
###267 a great new kwaito artist.
###269 How do you find them?
###270 
###275 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Red BK.
###277 They can also you hear you coming from blocks away,
###279 probably, right?
###280 So you probably have a big soundsystem.
###282 Can we go inside and have a listen?
###283 MANDLA: What--
###284 ELLIOT BAMBROUGH: To the music, yeah.
###285 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Yeah, let's do it.
###286 ELLIOT BAMBROUGH: Let's do this.
###287 It's not your typical cab ride.
###291 OK, so four speakers in the back here.
###294 [MUSIC PLAYING - KWAITO]
###302 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Yeah, this is good.
###304 ELLIOT BAMBROUGH: I think you actually have to be in there
###306 to really appreciate the power of the subwoofer sitting in
###308 the back and it reverberating through your entire body.
###310 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: It felt great.
###311 ELLIOT BAMBROUGH: So if you're ever in Soweto and you're
###313 looking for a taxi--
###315 BK Red.
###317 A mundane thing like getting in a cab, anywhere else in the
###321 world, is just that.
###322 But here, it's almost just like you're immersed in a
###325 cultural activity.
###326 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: When I was expecting to come here, I
###327 thought, you know, taxi stands in New York are shit holes.
###331 But this is like, it's kind of nice here, and the taxis
###334 themselves are just immaculate.
###336 
###374 ELLIOT BAMBROUGH: So what's the music that you
###376 play in your taxi?
###377 
###380 ELLIOT BAMBROUGH: House music.
###382 
###388 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: So do you think it's an
###389 evolution of the sound?
###390 
###402 ELLIOT BAMBROUGH: In America and in Europe, you get into a
###405 taxi, you don't talk to the taxi driver.
###407 You don't want to hear his music.
###408 You turn it down.
###409 And here it's a totally different lifestyle and
###412 acceptance of, you get into it because you want to have a
###415 conversation.
###415 You want to hear the music.
###416 Do you feel like a music promoter, in that respect?
###419 
###424 ELLIOT BAMBROUGH: So we managed to track down this DJ
###426 called DJ Qness.
###428 And he appears to be a bit of an authority on house music
###431 and also the shaping role that the taxi drivers have played
###434 in the house music scene here in Johannesburg.
###436 
###498 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: So now, when you hear your song coming out
###501 of a taxi, you know that you've made it.
###502 It's not your way of making it.
###504 You know that people have already heard your music.
###506 
###510 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Tonight we're meeting [INAUDIBLE]
###512 at a street party of Soweto to check out some local DJs spin
###515 South Africa's biggest house songs.
###518 ELLIOT BAMBROUGH: So we finally go to the party.
###520 It's completely bangin inside.
###522 We brought [INAUDIBLE] along to check out JKN, which dude,
###525 you're gonna absolutely love him.
###527 Guys, you ready?
###528 Want to go to a party?
###529 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Yeah, let's go.
###530 [MUSIC PLAYING - HOUSE]
###568 ELLIOT BAMBROUGH: Krishna.
###569 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Elliot.
###569 ELLIOT BAMBROUGH: South Africa.
###570 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: What a great trip.
###571 ELLIOT BAMBROUGH: Thanks so much for coming along.
###572 I've really enjoyed having you along for the ride.
###574 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Yeah, we had such a great time.
###574 Such great music.
###575 ELLIOT BAMBROUGH: Well, like talking about the music.
###576 I mean, like, I think we can agree that while taxi drivers
###579 and the role they played has changed.
###581 They'll always be inextricably linked with music and giving
###584 it to the people here.
###585 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Absolutely, and they
###586 bring people together.
###587 The music is irrepressible, so.
###588 ELLIOT BAMBROUGH: To the music, and the night's being
###590 young, and us still being here.
###591
