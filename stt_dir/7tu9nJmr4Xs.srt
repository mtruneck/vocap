1
0:0:13,295 --> 0:0:16,925
What's the most important part
of your health?


2
0:0:16,925 --> 0:0:18,846
What do you think?


3
0:0:18,846 --> 0:0:25,71
Is it eating a balanced,
mostly plant-based diet,


4
0:0:25,71 --> 0:0:31,692
balancing your hormones, daily exercise,
getting enough sleep --


5
0:0:31,692 --> 0:0:33,993
What do you guys think?


6
0:0:33,993 --> 0:0:37,762
Taking your vitamins,
seeing your doctor for regular check ups?


7
0:0:37,762 --> 0:0:40,43
(Laughter)


8
0:0:40,43 --> 0:0:45,143
These things might all seem
like important, even critical, factors


9
0:0:45,143 --> 0:0:50,202
to living a healthy life,
but what if I told you


10
0:0:50,202 --> 0:0:55,679
that caring for your body was
the least important part of your health?


11
0:0:55,679 --> 0:0:58,863
What do you think?


12
0:0:58,863 --> 0:1:1,813
I'm a physician,
so if you'd told me that five years ago,


13
0:1:1,813 --> 0:1:3,908
that would have been total sacrilege.


14
0:1:3,908 --> 0:1:7,311
I mean, I spent 12 years training,


15
0:1:7,311 --> 0:1:12,558
because the body is supposed to be
the foundation for everything in life.


16
0:1:12,558 --> 0:1:17,705
But what if I told you that the medical
profession had it all backwards,


17
0:1:17,705 --> 0:1:23,317
if the body doesn't shape
how we live our lives?


18
0:1:23,317 --> 0:1:29,408
What if the body is actually
a mirror of how we live our lives?


19
0:1:29,408 --> 0:1:32,911
Think about it for a minute.
Think about a time in your life


20
0:1:32,911 --> 0:1:37,129
where you weren't living the life
you were supposed to be living.


21
0:1:37,129 --> 0:1:40,24
Maybe you were in the wrong relationship;


22
0:1:40,24 --> 0:1:42,394
or you were in
some hostile work environment


23
0:1:42,394 --> 0:1:45,32
doing what you thought you should do;


24
0:1:45,32 --> 0:1:51,207
or you were creatively thwarted,
you felt spiritually disconnected.


25
0:1:51,207 --> 0:1:54,757
And what if you started getting
little inklings from the body,


26
0:1:54,757 --> 0:1:57,501
little physical symptoms?


27
0:1:57,501 --> 0:2:0,189
You know, the body's trying to tell you
something and you ignore it,


28
0:2:0,189 --> 0:2:3,391
'cause you're supposed to do
what you're doing.


29
0:2:3,391 --> 0:2:5,975
And then the body totally decompensates.


30
0:2:5,975 --> 0:2:8,604
Can you think about a time in your life
where something like that has happened?


31
0:2:8,604 --> 0:2:11,57
Yeah, I see a lot of noddings.


32
0:2:11,57 --> 0:2:14,901
Yeah, me too.
Same thing happened to me.


33
0:2:14,901 --> 0:2:18,512
So this is what the body does,
the body is brilliant this way,


34
0:2:18,512 --> 0:2:20,85
the body speaks to us in whispers.


35
0:2:20,85 --> 0:2:25,754
And if we ignore the whispers of the body,
the body starts to yell.


36
0:2:25,754 --> 0:2:30,621
Millions of people in this country
are ignoring the whispers of the body.


37
0:2:30,621 --> 0:2:33,42
We are suffering from an epidemic


38
0:2:33,42 --> 0:2:36,451
that modern medicine
has no idea what to do with.


39
0:2:36,451 --> 0:2:40,953
People suffering from
this epidemic are fatigued,


40
0:2:40,953 --> 0:2:47,116
they're anxious and depressed,
they toss and turn at night,


41
0:2:47,116 --> 0:2:50,882
they've lost their libido.


42
0:2:50,882 --> 0:2:57,886
They suffer from
a whole variety of aches and pains,


43
0:2:57,886 --> 0:3:0,808
so they go to the doctor,
'cause something is wrong.


44
0:3:0,808 --> 0:3:5,574
And the doctor
runs a whole battery of tests,


45
0:3:5,574 --> 0:3:9,962
and the tests all come back normal,
so the patient gets diagnosed as "well".


46
0:3:9,962 --> 0:3:12,149
Only the patient does not feel well.


47
0:3:12,149 --> 0:3:15,161
So she goes to another doctor and
she starts the whole process over again,


48
0:3:15,161 --> 0:3:17,682
because something is clearly wrong.


49
0:3:17,682 --> 0:3:23,322
And it is wrong,
it's just not what she thinks.


50
0:3:23,322 --> 0:3:26,274
I used to work in
a really busy managed care practice,


51
0:3:26,274 --> 0:3:28,594
I was seeing 40 patients a day.


52
0:3:28,594 --> 0:3:31,477
And I would get so freaking frustrated
with these patients.


53
0:3:31,477 --> 0:3:35,27
They would come in and it was so obvious
they were really suffering.


54
0:3:35,27 --> 0:3:36,984
And I'd run the tests,
everything would come back normal,


55
0:3:36,984 --> 0:3:39,913
I'd diagnose them well,
and they'd look at me like:


56
0:3:39,913 --> 0:3:42,779
No, I'm not well, something's wrong.


57
0:3:42,779 --> 0:3:46,674
And I felt so frustrated because
I couldn't come up with a diagnosis.


58
0:3:46,674 --> 0:3:49,667
And they just wanted, please God,
give me a pill.


59
0:3:49,667 --> 0:3:52,685
And there was no pill,
there's no pill to treat it,


60
0:3:52,685 --> 0:3:56,299
there's no lab test
to diagnose this epidemic,


61
0:3:56,299 --> 0:4:0,652
there's no vaccine to prevent it,
no surgery to cut it out.


62
0:4:0,652 --> 0:4:3,52
It wasn't until years later
that I realized I was suffering


63
0:4:3,52 --> 0:4:6,354
from the same epidemic 
my patients were.


64
0:4:6,354 --> 0:4:9,112
By the time I was 33 years old,


65
0:4:9,112 --> 0:4:10,383
I was your typical physician.


66
0:4:10,383 --> 0:4:14,456
I had succeeded in everything I ever
wanted to achieve in my life, I thought.


67
0:4:14,456 --> 0:4:18,18
I had all the trappings of success,
the ocean front house in San Diego,


68
0:4:18,18 --> 0:4:22,252
the vacation home, the boat,
the big fat retirement account,


69
0:4:22,252 --> 0:4:27,123
so I could be happy
one day in the future.


70
0:4:27,123 --> 0:4:30,569
I was twice divorced by that point.


71
0:4:30,569 --> 0:4:32,569
I had been diagnosed
with high blood pressure.


72
0:4:32,569 --> 0:4:36,351
I was taking three medications
that failed to control my blood pressure


73
0:4:36,351 --> 0:4:37,853
and I had just been diagnosed


74
0:4:37,853 --> 0:4:42,229
with precancerous cells
of my cervix that needed surgery.


75
0:4:42,229 --> 0:4:48,26
Even more importantly I was so
disconnected from who I was,


76
0:4:48,26 --> 0:4:57,81
so totally disillusioned with my job,
so completely spiritually tapped out,


77
0:4:57,81 --> 0:4:59,732
that I didn't even know
who I was any more.


78
0:4:59,732 --> 0:5:3,228
I'd covered myself up
with a whole series of masks.


79
0:5:3,228 --> 0:5:5,526
I had the doctor mask, like when you
put on the white coat,


80
0:5:5,526 --> 0:5:8,462
stand up on a pedestal,
pretend you got it all together,


81
0:5:8,462 --> 0:5:10,702
you know it all.


82
0:5:10,702 --> 0:5:13,257
And I am also a professional artist,
so I had the artist mask,


83
0:5:13,257 --> 0:5:15,95
where you've got to be, you know,
dark and brooding,


84
0:5:15,95 --> 0:5:22,329
mysterious -- starving,
that wasn't me either.


85
0:5:22,329 --> 0:5:24,385
And then I had gotten married
a third time,


86
0:5:24,385 --> 0:5:25,769
you know, third time is a charm.


87
0:5:25,769 --> 0:5:28,475
So now I've got this dutiful wife mask
I've gotta wear,


88
0:5:28,475 --> 0:5:29,872
where I've got to get dinner on the table


89
0:5:29,872 --> 0:5:33,41
and make sure
that I've got the right sexy lingerie on.


90
0:5:33,41 --> 0:5:35,0
And then I got pregnant and all of sudden


91
0:5:35,0 --> 0:5:38,191
there's this huge mummy mask
you're supposed to wear, right?


92
0:5:38,191 --> 0:5:39,78
You guys know the mummy mask.


93
0:5:39,78 --> 0:5:41,83
You're supposed to instantly
inherit the gene


94
0:5:41,83 --> 0:5:47,616
that makes you capable of baking the
perfect cupcake.


95
0:5:47,616 --> 0:5:50,24
That's where I was,
wearing all those masks,


96
0:5:50,24 --> 0:5:54,224
when my perfect storm hit.


97
0:5:54,224 --> 0:5:59,543
And at this point in my life,
it was January 2006,


98
0:5:59,543 --> 0:6:2,565
and I gave birth to my daughter
by C-section,


99
0:6:2,565 --> 0:6:5,202
my sixteen-year-old dog died,


100
0:6:5,202 --> 0:6:8,203
my healthy young brother wound up
in full-blown liver failure


101
0:6:8,203 --> 0:6:10,505
from the antibiotic Zithromax,


102
0:6:10,505 --> 0:6:17,639
and my beloved father passed away
from a brain tumor, all in two weeks.


103
0:6:17,639 --> 0:6:21,33
I had just started to take a breath,
when my husband,


104
0:6:21,33 --> 0:6:23,164
who was the stay home for my newborn,


105
0:6:23,164 --> 0:6:31,696
cut two fingers off his left hand
with the table saw.


106
0:6:31,696 --> 0:6:33,676
Yeah --


107
0:6:33,676 --> 0:6:41,687
They say when your life falls apart,
you either grow, or you grow a tumor.


108
0:6:41,687 --> 0:6:46,971
Fortunately for me I decided to grow,
there was something in me.


109
0:6:46,971 --> 0:6:53,762
SARK called it my "Inner Wise Self",
which I call your inner pilot light.


110
0:6:53,762 --> 0:7:0,65
It said, "It's time to take the masks off.
It's time to stop the madness.


111
0:7:0,65 --> 0:7:6,909
It's time to stop doing what you should,
and start doing what you feel."


112
0:7:6,909 --> 0:7:8,942
And in that moment I knew
I had to quit my job.


113
0:7:8,942 --> 0:7:13,956
Now, this was a huge deal, right?
I spent 12 years training to be a doctor


114
0:7:13,956 --> 0:7:16,32
and hundreds of thousands of dollars


115
0:7:16,32 --> 0:7:19,73
and we had all the trappings, you know,
the house, the mortgage,


116
0:7:19,73 --> 0:7:20,648
all the doctor stuff, right?


117
0:7:20,648 --> 0:7:24,951
My husband was not employed
and I had a newborn.


118
0:7:24,951 --> 0:7:28,712
I also had to pay a malpractice tail
to buy my freedom,


119
0:7:28,712 --> 0:7:32,207
a six-figure malpractice tail,
in case I ever got sued in the future.


120
0:7:32,207 --> 0:7:36,519
So I decided to do it, and God bless
my husband, who said let's jump together.


121
0:7:36,519 --> 0:7:39,262
And I quit my job
and I had to sell my house


122
0:7:39,262 --> 0:7:41,991
and liquidate my retirement account
and move to the country;


123
0:7:41,991 --> 0:7:47,79
and I spent a few months painting
and writing and licking my wounds.


124
0:7:47,79 --> 0:7:52,852
(Laughter)
(Applause)


125
0:7:52,852 --> 0:7:56,557
It wasn't until about nine months later,
everybody was like -- nine months!


126
0:7:56,557 --> 0:7:58,152
I'm an OB/GYN!


127
0:7:58,152 --> 0:8:1,864
Nine months later I realized you can quit
your job but you can't quit your calling.


128
0:8:1,864 --> 0:8:4,409
And I had been called at a very young age,
I was seven years old,


129
0:8:4,409 --> 0:8:8,752
to the service, the practice,
the spiritual practice of medicine;


130
0:8:8,752 --> 0:8:10,75
and that calling hadn't gone away.


131
0:8:10,75 --> 0:8:15,53
I had gotten so wounded by the system
that I didn't even notice it anymore;


132
0:8:15,53 --> 0:8:20,245
but it came back after I had rested
and healed after a little while.


133
0:8:20,245 --> 0:8:23,247
But I knew I couldn't go back,
I couldn't be seeing 40 patients a day,


134
0:8:23,247 --> 0:8:27,341
7,5 minutes with my patients,
that wasn't why I went to medical school.


135
0:8:27,341 --> 0:8:32,927
So it began this quest, that turned into
an almost five-year quest now,


136
0:8:32,927 --> 0:8:36,454
to rediscover
what I loved about medicine.


137
0:8:36,454 --> 0:8:39,505
So that also meant I had to figure out
what I hated about medicine.


138
0:8:39,505 --> 0:8:41,204
So I started by blaming everybody:


139
0:8:41,204 --> 0:8:43,962
it was the ambulance chasing
malpractice attorneys;


140
0:8:43,962 --> 0:8:47,71
it's big pharma;
it's managed care medicine;


141
0:8:47,71 --> 0:8:50,208
it's the insurance company's fault.


142
0:8:50,208 --> 0:8:52,69
Then I thought, oh no,
it's the reductionist medical system,


143
0:8:52,69 --> 0:8:55,395
we're so, so sub-specialized, 
you know?


144
0:8:55,395 --> 0:8:58,98
I'm an OB/GYN, so I was seeing
these patients that had pelvic problems.


145
0:8:58,98 --> 0:9:2,345
But I knew that there was something
bigger than the pelvis


146
0:9:2,345 --> 0:9:4,92
that was causing their issues.


147
0:9:4,92 --> 0:9:7,96
But I hadn't been trained
to really look at that.


148
0:9:7,96 --> 0:9:9,955
So I thought that's the problem,
like you go to your doctor,


149
0:9:9,955 --> 0:9:13,548
your pinky finger hurts and he says,
"I'm sorry, I'm a thumb doctor."


150
0:9:13,548 --> 0:9:16,13
(Laughter)


151
0:9:16,13 --> 0:9:18,814
Nobody's looking at the whole picture.


152
0:9:18,814 --> 0:9:21,545
So I thought integrative medicine
was the answer.


153
0:9:21,545 --> 0:9:24,347
And so I joined
an integrative medicine practice,


154
0:9:24,347 --> 0:9:28,68
and it was so much better; I got
a whole hour with my patients.


155
0:9:28,68 --> 0:9:30,409
I really got to listen to my patients,


156
0:9:30,409 --> 0:9:33,171
we didn't accept
managed care medical insurance,


157
0:9:33,171 --> 0:9:35,448
so it was really so much better.


158
0:9:35,448 --> 0:9:38,301
And then I still kept bumping up
against something though,


159
0:9:38,301 --> 0:9:40,378
because now if you came in
and you were depressed


160
0:9:40,378 --> 0:9:43,76
we were giving you herbs and amino acids
instead of Prozac.


161
0:9:43,76 --> 0:9:45,789
If you had other physical symptoms --


162
0:9:45,789 --> 0:9:48,24
but it was still this allopathic model,


163
0:9:48,24 --> 0:9:49,805
where the answer was outside of you,


164
0:9:49,805 --> 0:9:52,32
and I had to give you
something that you could take.


165
0:9:52,32 --> 0:9:55,522
So I thought maybe that's not the problem,
maybe I need to look outside of that


166
0:9:55,522 --> 0:9:58,65
and find new tools
for my healing toolbox.


167
0:9:58,65 --> 0:10:0,127
So I started working
with all these complementary


168
0:10:0,127 --> 0:10:1,528
and alternative health care providers,


169
0:10:1,528 --> 0:10:5,713
whom I love, acupuncturists,
naturopaths and nutritionists.


170
0:10:5,713 --> 0:10:9,21
And I started treating my patients
with needles in their energy meridians


171
0:10:9,21 --> 0:10:11,684
and raw foods, and that was great.


172
0:10:11,684 --> 0:10:14,783
But I kept bumping up
against the same thing:


173
0:10:14,783 --> 0:10:17,303
patients would get better from one symptom


174
0:10:17,303 --> 0:10:19,799
and if we didn't treat the root cause


175
0:10:19,799 --> 0:10:22,55
of why they had
that physical symptom in first place,


176
0:10:22,55 --> 0:10:25,68
they just wound up getting a new symptom.


177
0:10:25,68 --> 0:10:28,636
So at this point I was both
really frustrated and really curious,


178
0:10:28,636 --> 0:10:31,59
and I started down this path
of trying to figure out


179
0:10:31,59 --> 0:10:34,136
what really makes a body healthy,


180
0:10:34,136 --> 0:10:36,841
and what really makes us sick.


181
0:10:36,841 --> 0:10:40,432
And I dug into the medical literature
and spent a year researching


182
0:10:40,432 --> 0:10:44,227
all of the randomized controlled
clinical trials out there.


183
0:10:44,227 --> 0:10:46,263
And I decided this is it,
I'm going to figure it out,


184
0:10:46,263 --> 0:10:47,927
I'm going to find the answer.


185
0:10:47,927 --> 0:10:52,544
And I spent hours in the library,
researching, reading, studying.


186
0:10:52,544 --> 0:10:56,179
What I found blew my frigging mind,


187
0:10:56,179 --> 0:10:59,952
stuff nobody ever taught me
in medical school.


188
0:10:59,952 --> 0:11:4,103
All the things we think of as health,
all the things we think matter, they do.


189
0:11:4,103 --> 0:11:6,103
It matters that you exercise,
it matters that you eat well,


190
0:11:6,103 --> 0:11:8,104
it matters that you see the doctor.


191
0:11:8,104 --> 0:11:16,779
But nobody taught me that what
really matters is healthy relationships,


192
0:11:16,779 --> 0:11:22,591
having a healthy professional life,


193
0:11:22,591 --> 0:11:27,264
expressing yourself creatively,


194
0:11:27,264 --> 0:11:35,192
being spiritually connected,


195
0:11:35,192 --> 0:11:40,492
having a healthy sex life,


196
0:11:40,492 --> 0:11:44,984
being healthy financially,


197
0:11:44,984 --> 0:11:50,567
living in a healthy environment,


198
0:11:50,567 --> 0:11:54,984
being mentally healthy,


199
0:11:54,984 --> 0:11:57,775
and of course all the things
we traditionally associate with health,


200
0:11:57,775 --> 0:12:1,544
also matter,
all the things that nurture the body.


201
0:12:1,544 --> 0:12:4,471
The data on this is unbelievable.


202
0:12:4,471 --> 0:12:9,451
Lots of it is not in
the traditional journals that you read,


203
0:12:9,451 --> 0:12:13,2
that doctors read, a lot of its
in the psychological literature,


204
0:12:13,2 --> 0:12:14,824
the sociological literature.


205
0:12:14,824 --> 0:12:17,987
But if you look deep, this is in
The New England Journal of Medicine,


206
0:12:17,987 --> 0:12:20,252
it's in The Journal of the
American Medical Association,


207
0:12:20,252 --> 0:12:23,24
it's coming out of Harvard and Yale
and Johns Hopkins.


208
0:12:23,24 --> 0:12:28,206
This is real data proving
that these things are just as important,


209
0:12:28,206 --> 0:12:30,256
if not more.


210
0:12:30,256 --> 0:12:32,357
I have this patient,
she's a raw vegan,


211
0:12:32,357 --> 0:12:35,451
she runs marathons,
she takes 20 supplements a day,


212
0:12:35,451 --> 0:12:38,55
she sleeps eight hours a night,
she does everything her doctor tells her,


213
0:12:38,55 --> 0:12:42,264
she's got a chart this fat, and
she's still got multiple health problems.


214
0:12:42,264 --> 0:12:46,793
So she had heard about my philosophy
I had started practicing with my patients,


215
0:12:46,793 --> 0:12:49,684
and I have an intake form
that's about 20 pages long


216
0:12:49,684 --> 0:12:54,134
and it asks about all those things,
relationships, work life, spiritual life,


217
0:12:54,134 --> 0:12:57,824
creative life, sex life,
all of these things that make you whole.


218
0:12:57,824 --> 0:13:1,887
So she came and she filled out her form and
she said, "Doctor, what's my diagnosis?"


219
0:13:1,887 --> 0:13:5,824
And I said, "Honey, your diagnosis is
you're in a freaking abusive marriage.


220
0:13:5,824 --> 0:13:10,407
You hate your job,
you feel creatively thwarted,


221
0:13:10,407 --> 0:13:13,824
you're spiritually disconnected,


222
0:13:13,824 --> 0:13:16,24
and you haven't let go of that resentment
you have against your father


223
0:13:16,24 --> 0:13:18,43
who molested you as a child.


224
0:13:18,43 --> 0:13:23,205
Your body is never gonna get well
until you heal that."


225
0:13:23,205 --> 0:13:27,427
So if taking care of the body isn't
the most important part of being healthy,


226
0:13:27,427 --> 0:13:29,91
what is?


227
0:13:29,91 --> 0:13:34,932
It's caring for the mind,
caring for the heart,


228
0:13:34,932 --> 0:13:38,264
caring for the soul,


229
0:13:38,264 --> 0:13:42,15
tapping into what I call
your inner pilot light.


230
0:13:42,15 --> 0:13:44,695
Now your pilot light is that part of you,
that essence,


231
0:13:44,695 --> 0:13:50,158
that authentic, deep, true part of you,
that spiritual, divine spark


232
0:13:50,158 --> 0:13:52,2
that always knows what's right for you.


233
0:13:52,2 --> 0:13:55,637
You're born with it,
it goes with you when you die,


234
0:13:55,637 --> 0:13:59,139
and it always knows
the truth about you and your body.


235
0:13:59,139 --> 0:14:2,326
It comes to you and whispers;
it's your intuition;


236
0:14:2,326 --> 0:14:6,473
it's that beautiful part of you
that is your biggest fan;


237
0:14:6,473 --> 0:14:9,731
the part that writes you love letters.


238
0:14:9,731 --> 0:14:12,499
And that is the biggest healer
you can tap into,


239
0:14:12,499 --> 0:14:16,233
better than any medicine,
better than any doctor.


240
0:14:16,233 --> 0:14:21,46
So based on everything that I learned,
I developed a new wellness model.


241
0:14:21,46 --> 0:14:23,593
And it was based,
not on the pie charts and pyramids


242
0:14:23,593 --> 0:14:26,534
that many of the wellness models
I had studied were based on.


243
0:14:26,534 --> 0:14:28,324
I based it on the cairn.


244
0:14:28,324 --> 0:14:31,389
Have you guys seen these things
around San Francisco?


245
0:14:31,389 --> 0:14:34,451
These stacks of balanced stones,
I love them, I've always loved them.


246
0:14:34,451 --> 0:14:36,395
I'm an artist,
so it appeals to me visually.


247
0:14:36,395 --> 0:14:40,887
But I love the interdependence.
Every stone is dependent on the other;


248
0:14:40,887 --> 0:14:44,264
you can't just pull one stone out
without the whole thing crumbling.


249
0:14:44,264 --> 0:14:47,544
And the stone that's most precarious
is the one on top.


250
0:14:47,544 --> 0:14:49,949
That's the body,
that's where I think of the body.


251
0:14:49,949 --> 0:14:53,46
The body is the stone on top.


252
0:14:53,46 --> 0:14:57,108
When any of the facets of
what makes you whole get out of balance,


253
0:14:57,108 --> 0:15:0,46
the body is the first to start whispering,


254
0:15:0,46 --> 0:15:2,797
and the foundation stone
is your inner pilot light,


255
0:15:2,797 --> 0:15:7,513
that true essence of you,
that vulnerable, transparent part of you.


256
0:15:7,513 --> 0:15:13,9
So based on that, I created this model,
that I call the whole health cairn.


257
0:15:13,9 --> 0:15:15,485
And this is what my next book is about.


258
0:15:15,485 --> 0:15:19,42
An it's taking all of the facets
of what makes you whole;


259
0:15:19,42 --> 0:15:24,7
it's about self-healing from the core,
and once you recognize this,


260
0:15:24,7 --> 0:15:29,15
then you have all the tools you need
to start your own healing journey.


261
0:15:29,15 --> 0:15:32,54
So all of the facets of
what makes you whole are surrounded


262
0:15:32,54 --> 0:15:34,482
by what I call the healing bubble.


263
0:15:34,482 --> 0:15:37,731
This is love and gratitude and pleasure.


264
0:15:37,731 --> 0:15:40,12
And science proves
that all of those things


265
0:15:40,12 --> 0:15:45,249
are good for your health as well; they are
the glue that hold everything together.


266
0:15:45,249 --> 0:15:50,575
So I challenge you.
If you have any physical symptom,


267
0:15:50,575 --> 0:15:54,921
if you're suffering from the epidemic
that plagues the developed world,


268
0:15:54,921 --> 0:15:58,635
I want you to ask yourself,
"What's the real reason I'm sick


269
0:15:58,635 --> 0:16:5,108
or suffering, what's out of balance
in my whole health cairn?"


270
0:16:5,108 --> 0:16:11,614
What's the real diagnosis
and what can you do about it?


271
0:16:11,614 --> 0:16:13,934
How can you be more transparent?


272
0:16:13,934 --> 0:16:17,108
How can you open yourself up
to more possibility?


273
0:16:17,108 --> 0:16:22,233
How can you be more honest with yourself
about what you need and who you are?


274
0:16:22,233 --> 0:16:24,893
If any of you were lucky enough to see
Brene Brown's awesome TEDTalk


275
0:16:24,893 --> 0:16:27,319
about the power of vulnerability --


276
0:16:27,319 --> 0:16:30,46
I feel a lot of nodding heads,
I love it --


277
0:16:30,46 --> 0:16:34,139
it's so fabulous, but it talks about
the science behind being true,


278
0:16:34,139 --> 0:16:37,173
being vulnerable, being transparent.


279
0:16:37,173 --> 0:16:41,98
It generates love and intimacy
which increases oxytocin and endorphins,


280
0:16:41,98 --> 0:16:46,326
and reduces harmful stress hormones
like cortisol and adrenalin.


281
0:16:46,326 --> 0:16:51,855
When we let our true self be seen,
when we let our inner pilot light radiate,


282
0:16:51,855 --> 0:16:53,33
we heal from the inside out


283
0:16:53,33 --> 0:16:57,886
and it's more powerful than anything
medicine can give you from the outside.


284
0:16:57,886 --> 0:17:1,418
So I challenge you to write
the prescription for yourself.


285
0:17:1,418 --> 0:17:3,983
No doctor can do this for you.
We can give you drugs,


286
0:17:3,983 --> 0:17:6,793
we can give you surgery,
and sometimes you need that,


287
0:17:6,793 --> 0:17:10,607
that's the jump-start
of the self-healing process.


288
0:17:10,607 --> 0:17:14,332
But to heal to the core, so that
you don't develop new symptoms,


289
0:17:14,332 --> 0:17:18,933
so you don't need another surgery --
you gotta write your own prescription.


290
0:17:18,933 --> 0:17:26,825
So I ask you, "What is it that you need,
what does your body need to get healthy?


291
0:17:26,825 --> 0:17:32,357
What is it that you need to change,
What needs to be tweaked in your life?"


292
0:17:32,357 --> 0:17:34,722
If you knew
that stripping off all of your masks


293
0:17:34,722 --> 0:17:37,5
and letting us see
that beautiful light within you,


294
0:17:37,5 --> 0:17:41,658
was the solution to your health problems,
would you be willing to do it?


295
0:17:41,658 --> 0:17:44,264
I dare you.


296
0:17:44,264 --> 0:17:48,201
It just might make
your body right for miracles.


297
0:17:48,201 --> 0:17:49,739
Thank you.


298
0:17:49,739 --> 0:19:49,739
(Applause)
