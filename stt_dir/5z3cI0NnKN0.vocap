###102 SARAH SILVERMAN: Come on, there's a lot of show.
###105 There's a lot of show, all right?
###109 Hey, everybody.
###110 It's me, your friendly neighborhood Sarah Silverman.
###113 And I'm here to say, welcome to the
###119 Internet, the Wild West.
###121 You always hear people say that, right?
###122 The Internet is like the Wild West.
###124 That's because it is, all right?
###126 It's totally unregulated.
###128 So I thought it would be cool to see just how far we could
###131 go without any consequences.
###134 What do you think?
###138 All right.
###141 Well, for starters, I know that it's highly illegal to
###144 impersonate a federal employee, all right?
###147 Oh shit, look at me.
###150 I am a mail man, you guys.
###153 I swear to God.
###156 I swear to God, I am a mail man.
###158 I deliver mail for the United States Postal Service.
###162 I cover the 03110 zip code of Bedford, New Hampshire.
###166 And oh shit, look at this, special delivery, y'all.
###171 Candy.
###172 Looks like Snickers.
###174 [APPLAUSE]
###180 SETH ROGEN: How's it going?
###181 Good to see you.

###185 I want in on this action.
###186 SARAH SILVERMAN: Yeah, let's do it.
###187 SETH ROGEN: Yeah.
###188 I need in.
###188 I want in.
###189 SARAH SILVERMAN: What do you got?
###191 SETH ROGEN: Tell you what I've got.
###193 I got a bootlegged copy, pirated, "Star Trek Into
###196 Darkness." If the FBI knows we watched this, we get five
###200 years right away.
###201 Let's watch this.
###202 SARAH SILVERMAN: Let's do it.
###203 SETH ROGEN: Nice.
###204 
###206 Let's shove it in there.
###209 SARAH SILVERMAN: Perfect.
###209 SETH ROGEN: Sure, boom.
###210 SARAH SILVERMAN: All right, it's in.
###212 SETH ROGEN: OK, Play.
###213 Nice, it's working.

###261 SETH ROGEN: No, no, no, no.
###264 Jesus, Sarah, no.
###265 SARAH SILVERMAN: Suck my dick!
###266 SETH ROGEN: No, the FBI should not eat a dick.
###268 He's dead.
###269 You just killed a production assistant.
###271 SARAH SILVERMAN: Oh, what is this? "The
###272 Guild Trip" part deux?
###274 SETH ROGEN: OK, ha ha ha.
###275 SARAH SILVERMAN: What is this? "The Guilt Trip"
###277 too boring too watch?
###279 SETH ROGEN: OK, Sarah, I'm serious.
###280 Jesus Christ.
###282 A man is dead now.
###283 SARAH SILVERMAN: (MOCKING) A man is--
###284 SETH ROGEN: He's dead.
###285 
###288 SARAH SILVERMAN: Oh.
###289 Oh my God.
###291 SETH ROGEN: Yeah.
###292 SARAH SILVERMAN: Oh no.
###293 Oh no.
###295 Fuck, oh shit, kid, wake up.
###297 Oh God.
###298 I'm sorry.
###299 SETH ROGEN: Oh, Jesus.
###300 That's not going to--
###301 SARAH SILVERMAN: Why are you bleeding?
###302 Oh fuck.
###303 SETH ROGEN: It's not going to work.
###304 I have to call the cops now, Sarah.
###306 I've got to--
###307 SARAH SILVERMAN: No.
###308 No.
###308 Don't call the cops.
###309 SETH ROGEN: I have to call the cops.
###310 SARAH SILVERMAN: No.
###310 Then I have to do this.
###312 SETH ROGEN: No, Sarah, don't, don't.
###313 Chill out.
###314 Don't do something you'll regret, OK?
###315 SARAH SILVERMAN: Oh, don't do something I'll regret?
###317 SETH ROGEN: Yes.
###317 SARAH SILVERMAN: Don't do something I'll regret?
###319 Seth, don't you think it's a little too fucking late for
###320 that, you graveling, throw it in, laughing fuck?

###333 
###338 SARAH SILVERMAN: Whoa.
###339 That stung.
###340 That really--
###342 you know, it's just so misogynistic.
###347 I guess everybody has like their trigger words?
###349 That was my trigger word.
###351 SETH ROGEN: Well, I'm sorry.
###352 I guess I'm sorry, OK?
###354 SARAH SILVERMAN: No problem.
###355 Listen, we're here testing boundaries.
###356 That's what we're here for.
###357 And I guess we found our ceiling, you know?
###360 SETH ROGEN: The ceiling is cunt.
###363 The cunt ceiling.
###364 SARAH SILVERMAN: Infamous cunt ceiling.
###365 SETH ROGEN: The cunt ceiling.
###368 Oh, shit.
###369 SARAH SILVERMAN: Oh God.
###370 Well, now we know.
###371 And I'm so sorry I stabbed you.
###372 That was shitty.
###373 SETH ROGEN: It's OK.
###374 At least you didn't slit my throat and kill me, you know?
###377 SARAH SILVERMAN: Good point.
###378 SETH ROGEN: Good point.
###379 I think you made the good point into his trachea, right?
###383 SARAH SILVERMAN: You are so good with world play.
###385 SETH ROGEN: Thank you.
###386 I try, I try.
###387 SARAH SILVERMAN: I'm so glad we're friends.
###388 SETH ROGEN: I am too, Sarah.
###388 This is great.
###389 What do you say we get the show started, huh?
###391 SARAH SILVERMAN: Great idea, Seth.
###392 SETH ROGEN: Awesome.
###393 SARAH SILVERMAN: Ladies and gentlemen, hold in all your
###396 pee and poo and put your hands together for the world's

###421 So I stay on my hustle to keep my pocketbook thick.
###424 I got papers and papers and papes all

###427 Just sold my car for some drapes.
###429 Don't get shit on 'em.
###430 I've got that diaper money.
###431 I've got that diaper money, dude.

###443 I've got that pussy on lock.
###445 I've got that wife pussy on lock 24/7.
###448 Whenever she lets me, I'm in same pussy heaven.
###451 And the best part about it is no one else can have it.
###454 And also, I can't have it, unless she says I can.
###457 See a girl on the street, man, I can't, so I won't.
###460 See my wife at home, and I would, but she hates my guts.
###463 Wife pussy, I've got that wife pussy.

###476 It's right off the highway.
###478 Wobbedy wobbedy wobbedy drop into my grave plot.
###481 You afraid of death?
###483 Well, I'm afraid not.
###484 Because I got the bomb spot right off the highway.
###487 I did it my way, a very small percent of the dime way.
###491 I've got my coffin picked out.
###493 Styrofoam painted like wood, tricked out.
###496 It's even got handles to lower me smooth.
###499 And my tombstone only has minimal typos.
###502 Grave plot, I've got that grave plot.
###504 I've got that grave plot, right next to my dad.
###508 I've got that diaper money.
###509 I've got that wife pussy.

###512 I'm a grown ass man.
###516 [APPLAUSE]
###521 All right, spring break, do you know what time it is?
###523 I'm going to need all the hot girls to come on
###525 the stage right now.
###526 Fellas, let me hear you make some noise.
###529 
###533 Kings of the pussy, pounding on brewskies.
###536 Banging chicks right there in the sand.
###539 Bros before hoes and chicks with no clothes and slamming
###544 shots and marry a man.

###566 Giant sombreros, show us your titties.
###570 Creatine shakes, marry a man.
###574 Oh shit, I'm too fucked up.
###576 Puke and rally, that's what's up.
###577 Booze cruise, raise your glass.
###579 Snort that coke off her ass.
###581 Two chicks at the dance hall, take it to the dance stall.
###583 Trade these beads for their bras.
###587 So-Co in my canteen, got girls jumping on trampoline.
###590 Two men bound by the law.
###593 Trashy motel rooms, clogging up toilets.
###596 Beer goggles if she's a hag.
###599 Planning the menu, picking out flowers.
###602 Nailing sluts and writing our vows.
###605 Down here, it's our time.
###608 Spring breakers, let's get fucked up.
###613 Then find Mr. Right and get monogamous.
###618 Picking our invite font as a twosome, something tasteful
###622 but not too bland.
###624 Seating arrangements, charming the in-laws.
###628 Ripping beer pong, sex with a man.
###631 We'll be so happy, true love forever.
###634 Two kings walking hand in hand.

###659 Everybody in the front to the fucking deck.
###662 Stand on your motherfucking toes.
###665 We running this, let's go.
###667 I'm on a bat.
###667 I'm on a boat, everybody.
###669 Look at me, 'cause I'm sailing on a boat.
###672 I'm on a boat.
###674 I'm on a boat.
###675 Take a good, hard look at the motherfucking boat.
###678 T-PAIN: Yeah, yeah.
###679 I never thought I'd be on a boat.
###683 It's a big, blue watery road.
###686 Poseidon, look at me.
###690 THE LONELY ISLAND: All hands on deck.
###692 T-PAIN: I never thought I'd see the day when a big boat
###697 coming my way.
###699 Believe me when I say, I fucked a mermaid.
###705 THE LONELY ISLAND: I'm on a boat.
###706 I'm on a boat.
###707 Everybody look at me, because I'm sailing on a boat.
###710 I'm on a boat.
###712 I'm on a boat.
###713 So take a good, hard look at the motherfucking boat.
###716 
###722 [APPLAUSE]
###727 
###744 FATAL FARM: No thanks, no thank you.
###745 MALE SPEAKER: I do a really good job.
###746 FATAL FARM: Really, I'm not interested.
###748 
###754 OK?
###755 
###765 [ENGINE REVS]
###771 
###794 He just flew away.
###796 
###802 KYLE MOONEY: This next act, no, this next act isn't--
###804 oh, sorry.
###805 I messed up.
###808 You know, this next act isn't what I had for breakfast.
###812 It's Garfunkel and Oates.
###814 
###816 I didn't know if that-- was it still me?
###818 
###822 GARFUNKEL AND OATES: Hi.
###825 What's up, guys, how are you?
###827 
###830 So in this song, we play the same woman two years apart.
###834 I'm 29.
###835 And I'm 31.
###837 So same woman, two years apart, singing about love.
###840 This song is called 29 31.
###844 For the first time in my life, I see it clearly.
###846 I realize the power of being a woman.
###849 29 years old and time's on my side.
###851 I'm in my prime.
###852 I've hit my stride.
###853 I've got so much charisma and so many options.
###855 It's nice to always have my pick.
###857 There's nobody left.
###859 I'm all alone.
###861 
###869 I'm at the top of my game.
###870 Possibilities are endless.
###871 And I just feel really pretty.
###873 I'm holding out for someone who meets my standards.
###876 Won't settle for anything less than perfect.
###878 I know what I want.
###879 And I can have it.
###880 I'm surrounded by love and peace.
###881 There's nobody left.
###883 I'm all alone.
###886 Why did I wait?
###887 What's wrong with me?
###888 In two short years, I'm going to be 33.
###890 Who the hell will want me then?
###891 My ovaries are shrinking.
###892 I'm disgusting and everyone feels bad for me.
###894 And I never get invited to dinner parties anymore.
###899 Things unfold when they're supposed to, because
###901 everything happens for a reason.
###903 It'll happen for me when I'm not even looking.
###905 He'll just appear, and I'll just know.
###907 And he'll love me forever without any work.
###909 Who needs to try when things are meant to be?
###911 There's nobody left.
###913 I'm a catch, just look at me.
###914 I'm all alone.
###915 You're such a fucking idiot.
###917 You think you're so special because people tell you that
###919 now, but that'll stop when they're replaced
###920 with looks of pity.
###921 My life complete.
###922 The world is a buffet of love.
###924 Oh, what?
###925 You think biological reality doesn't apply to you in your
###927 adorable cocoon of agelessness?
###929 Well, it does.
###930 While you're just waiting around and focusing on you,
###932 guess what?
###933 You're going to miss your fucking window.
###935 
###938 Everything happens for a reason.
###940 You know I truly believe that.
###941 Yeah, you said that before.
###943 Oh my God, it does though.
###944 Everything happens for a reason.
###946 What about the Haitian earthquake or cellulite on
###948 skinny women?
###949 Just say, hey universe, I'm ready.
###950 It'll happen when you least expect it.
###952 Well, I don't expect it at all now.
###954 So I guess it's right around the corner.
###955 Maybe you're putting out the wrong vibe.
###957 Maybe you're closed off to love.
###959 Let me tell you a secret.
###960 It's called the secret.
###961 There's another secret.
###962 You're an asshole.
###963 
###965 Your negativity is a self-fulfilling prophecy.
###967 The reason things go well for me is because of positivity.
###969 Well, I'm positive fertility always begins to atrophy when
###972 infantile fantasy eclipses true reality.
###973 It never once occurred to me that things
###974 won't work out perfectly.
###975 When God closes a door, you see, he opens a window.
###979 You realize that's a smaller opening, right?
###982 You used to just be able to walk out a door, and now you
###983 have to climb out some slightly ajar window
###985 somewhere, possibly falling like eight
###986 stories to your death.
###987 That is not an upgrade.
###989 You know what else?
###990 There's nobody left!
###992 So many people on the planet.
###993 I'm all alone!
###995 Oh my God!
###995 I'm really lonely!
###995 I'm so happy, I'm really happy.
###996 Everthing really sucks on this side.
###998 Ahhh!
###999 You get with someone else, do you love yourself?
###1003 You get with someone else, do you love youself?
###1007 
###1011 'Cause life is--
###1014 good.
###1014 Over.
###1016 Thanks, everybody.
###1017 
###1020 Thanks, guys.
###1022 We would now like to bring out the next comedian.
###1024 Please welcome the voice of the eTrade baby, Pete Holmes.
###1028 
###1040 PETE HOLMES: There's a Snickers right there.
###1042 Do you want a Snickers?
###1044 You put your hand out very entitled like.
###1047 There you go.
###1048 Someone stepped on it.
###1051 Good to see you.
###1052 Good to be here.
###1052 I'm feeling pretty good.
###1055 Thank you.
###1055 Yeah, all right, just general enthusiasm, I appreciate that.
###1059 I'm feeling pretty good, despite the fact that I ate at
###1061 Subway for lunch.
###1063 Yeah, no I know, I feel that.
###1065 We all eat there.
###1066 It's always crowded.
###1068 But it is garbage.
###1070 Don't back away.
###1071 I'm probably going there after the show.
###1074 It's also horrible.
###1075 It's the worst thing in the world.
###1076 And you know that.
###1077 You know when you're in line at Subway, part of you is
###1079 looking forward to your sandwich.
###1080 But in the back of your brain, you're just like, something
###1084 fucked up is happening here.
###1086 Can't quite put my finger on it.
###1088 But the call is coming from inside the house.
###1091 It's bad.
###1092 You know this.
###1093 Everything at Subway tastes the same.
###1095 It all tastes the way the restaurant smells--
###1098 that vague, cardboard, sawdust smell.
###1101 Everything, it doesn't matter what you order, a sandwich,
###1103 your soda, the receipt, it's saturated in that smell.
###1108 And they do it in front of you.
###1109 That's their big idea, like you're a king.
###1113 Choose from the bounty.
###1116 'Tis been a good year.
###1119 More orange tomatoes, my liege?
###1124 And they shouldn't.
###1125 Have you ever, for the love of God, been in the Subway when
###1127 they run out of turkey?
###1129 They don't just flick the lights off, perfect blackness,
###1131 flick them back on, and have more turkey.
###1134 That's what they should do.
###1135 What they do do is reach down into the bowels of hell,
###1140 making unbreaking eye contact like a college freshman
###1143 playing Hey There Delilah on the acoustic, just looking
###1146 through you.
###1147 And they pull out another shrink wrapped plastic tube of
###1150 turkey, with all the pieces the exact same size, laser cut
###1154 like coasters, with a fake skin airbrushed on the side.
###1159 They cut it out with that little yellow knife.
###1161 Satan's ass air is released.
###1164 They're just like, three disgusting pieces.
###1167 We're just schmucks.
###1168 Like oh, could I get double meat?
###1169 They're like, yeah, peeling them off like ones from
###1172 Satan's bank roll, everything sitting on those black, open
###1176 air, S&M containers.
###1178 You can see your reflection in the wet ham.
###1181 It's gross.
###1183 You shouldn't be able to watch someone make something so
###1186 disgusting.
###1186 Bring it from the back.
###1189 That's what the back is for.
###1192 If this is what they're doing in the front, what the hell
###1195 are they doing in the back?
###1197 Just shaving a gorilla, like, new low fat gorilla bread.
###1202 Jared's naked up to here in marinara.
###1204 
###1207 Eat fresh.
###1208 
###1210 You can write your own meatballs joke.
###1212 I can't do everything.
###1215 Very excited, there's magicians on this show.
###1217 Did you know that?
###1217 Did you know you're going to see magic?
###1220 I'm stoked.
###1221 I love magic.
###1223 But I am very, very grateful that I'm not a magician.
###1227 Have you ever taken a moment to be grateful that you're not
###1230 a magician?
###1231 I can come out and be like look, I stepped on a Snickers.
###1233 You want it, you entitled person?
###1235 I can do whatever I want.
###1236 I'm just a hammy guy, it's fine.
###1238 A magician has to be magic.
###1241 Are you listening?
###1242 Magic, the thing that none of us are.
###1246 That is a lot of pressure.
###1247 Backstage, you're just some regular guy named Verne,
###1251 eating nachos.
###1252 Like yeah, it's a pretty good house.
###1253 Pretty good, yeah.
###1255 The food's half off, my parents are here.
###1256 Putting a bird in your sleeve.
###1257 It's going to be a good show.
###1259 And they're like, ladies and gentleman, Excelsior.
###1261 You're like, excuse me.
###1264 Covered in silk, like I was born on the tip of a pyramid.
###1268 Owls landing on you.
###1269 You're just fucking Verne, the nacho guy.
###1272 And comedy audiences are great.
###1274 You guys want the show to be good.
###1276 Magic is the only kind of entertainment where 99% of the
###1280 audience is trying to ruin the show for themselves.
###1283 Go to a magic show, just a sea of close minded, threatened
###1286 dudes that are just like, no.
###1289 No way.
###1290 That ain't possible.
###1292 It's probably a mirror, right?
###1294 It's a mirror.
###1295 You can't saw her in half.
###1296 Shit's illegal.
###1299 Yeah, you did it.
###1300 You proved what no one else was trying to prove.
###1302 The boy on stage isn't actually a wizard.
###1305 Good job.
###1306 It cost you $35 to get in here.
###1308 Not me, I love magic.
###1310 Look at my friendly, open face.
###1312 I sit in the front.
###1313 You think I volunteer?
###1314 You're goddamn right I volunteer.
###1316 Magician drops a fake thumb, I didn't see shit.
###1318 I live in a non-magic world all day.
###1320 Make it magic.
###1323 I saw a man fly at a magic show.
###1326 I didn't misspeak.
###1327 I saw a man fly.
###1329 A wingless mammal took flight.
###1332 Can you imagine if I flew right now?
###1334 If I could just figure out the muscle in my ass to flex?
###1338 I pick fucking Snickers girl up, and we
###1339 fly around the room?
###1342 Best night of our lives.
###1343 And I saw this.
###1344 And suddenly, I'm eight years old again.
###1346 And I'm filled with majesty and wonder.
###1347 And as I'm watching this man fly, a guy next to me, I don't
###1350 know this guy, who's this guy, leans over to me and goes,
###1354 it's a magnet.
###1357 Magnet.
###1358 No man can fly.
###1360 Magnet.
###1361 
###1363 Two things.
###1364 First of all, shut up.
###1366 Shut your mouth, and just enjoy the show.
###1368 Two, magnet?
###1370 That doesn't explain shit.
###1373 What does that mean, magnets?
###1374 He's got magnets in his pocket?
###1376 The stage is a magnet?
###1377 That would look horrible.
###1379 I think those are just two things he doesn't understand.
###1382 Like, I don't get magnets, and I don't get this.
###1388 This is magnets.
###1390 Thank you very much, everybody.
###1391 That's my time.
###1392 
###1395 Appreciate that, appreciate it.
###1399 We're going to keep this going.
###1400 I've got to tell you, this show is so great that even our
###1402 warm up guy is one of my absolute favorite comedians.
###1405 Is he in the house?
###1405 Steven Brody Stevens.

###1578 BLAKE ANDERSON: Actually, more like, let's get cute.
###1581 All right?
###1581 Let's get really cute tonight, guys.
###1583 Because we've been asked to host the 2013
###1587 YouTube Cute Off.
###1588 ADAM DEVINE: Yep.
###1590 BLAKE ANDERSON: Yeah.
###1591 Yeah.
###1592 ADAM DEVINE: I'm actually a little butt hurt that they
###1594 didn't ask me to be a participant in the Cute Off.
###1597 Because I feel like I've been looking really cute lately.
###1600 BLAKE ANDERSON: He has.
###1600 He looks fucking really cute.
###1603 ADAM DEVINE: No, I know.
###1603 I'm looking really fucking cute.
###1604 I know that about myself.
###1605 BLAKE ANDERSON: Really fucking cute, man.
###1606 Very cute.
###1608 But let's introduce our competitors.
###1610 ADAM DEVINE: Sure.
###1610 BLAKE ANDERSON: First, from outer space, weighing in at
###1614 four pounds, Lil Bub.
###1617 
###1623 Look at his eyeballs.
###1624 ADAM DEVINE: Oh my God, he's so cute.
###1626 Oh my God, he's so cute.
###1629 And his opponent, from Conyers,
###1631 Georgia, weighing in at--
###1633 I feel that's rude to ask.
###1634 BLAKE ANDERSON: It is a little bit.
###1635 ADAM DEVINE: Because he could be in a
###1636 chubby phase right now.
###1636 Maybe he doesn't want people to know how much he weighs.
###1639 BLAKE ANDERSON: True.
###1639 ADAM DEVINE: Let's give it up for Lil
###1641 Jack McBrayer, everybody.
###1643 
###1646 Oh my God, he's so cute.
###1650 BLAKE ANDERSON: OK, OK, OK.
###1653 Very cute.
###1653 ADAM DEVINE: So cute.
###1654 BLAKE ANDERSON: Very cute.
###1656 Round One.
###1657 Give us your most adorable face, go.
###1660 ADAM DEVINE: Adorable face off, go!
###1663 Lil Bub, oh my God, that is cute.
###1665 Oh, look, he's so tiny.
###1666 His tongue's out.
###1667 His eyes are huge.
###1668 That is so cute.
###1669 Cute overload.
###1670 BLAKE ANDERSON: Oh my God.
###1671 ADAM DEVINE: Oh my God.
###1673 Oh!
###1674 Oh, he's so fucking cute.
###1676 He's so cute.
###1677 BLAKE ANDERSON: Oh man, this is going to be tough.
###1680 I don't know which one to shoot.
###1681 
###1685 ADAM DEVINE: Please don't--
###1687 you don't shoot them.
###1690 Let's just move on to the next round.
###1692 And that next round, dare I say it, overall cuteness.
###1697 Go!
###1699 [SCREAMING]
###1705 Oh, I don't know, I don't know which is cuter.
###1708 Oh!
###1709 Oh my God.
###1710 He's so cute, a lollipop!
###1713 Oh my God.
###1716 BLAKE ANDERSON: I don't know, this is really tough.
###1717 Maybe we should make them do something.
###1719 ADAM DEVINE: I don't know if that's possible.
###1720 They're both cats.
###1721 You can't just make cats do whatever you want.
###1723 Except, I don't know, this is just a genius move that I just
###1725 thought of and had them preplan, maybe--
###1728 play with yarn.
###1729 BLAKE ANDERSON: I like that idea.
###1730 ADAM DEVINE: Play with yarn!
###1732 
###1737 Oh my God, that is so cute.
###1738 He doesn't know what to do with the yarn.
###1742 Lil Bub's a little disinterested.
###1744 Will that count against him?
###1746 Will that count against him?
###1747 Lil Bub doesn't seem to want to play with the yarn.
###1751 BLAKE ANDERSON: How are was supposed to pick a winner?
###1754 Aww!
###1757 ADAM DEVINE: Did he just die?
###1758 BLAKE ANDERSON: Oh man, they are just both so
###1760 unbelievably cute.
###1762 How are we going to pick a winner?
###1764 ADAM DEVINE: Well, I don't know.
###1765 I feel like we have to.
###1766 Let's deliberate real quick, just me and you.
###1768 BLAKE ANDERSON: I like his tongue.
###1770 His tongue's cute too, though.
###1772 ADAM DEVINE: He also has a very cute tongue.
###1774 OK, you know what?
###1775 
###1779 OK, only one could win.
###1780 And the winner we choose won our hearts despite having
###1784 heart worms.
###1785 The winner of the 2013 YouTube Cute Off and a year's supply
###1791 of Fancy Feast is Lil Jack McBrayer, everybody.
###1796 
###1799 Congratulations.
###1800 What a cutie.
###1801 
###1804 JACK MCBRAYER: Thank you.
###1805 Thank you very much.
###1805 But you know I'm not really a cat.
###1809 [SCREAMING]
###1812 BLAKE ANDERSON: It's a talking cat!
###1813 ADAM DEVINE: It's a talking cat!
###1814 BLAKE ANDERSON: It's a talking cat!

###1849 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###1887 
###1895 THE FINE BROTHERS: Hi.
###1896 We're the Fine Brothers.
###1897 For those of you who don't know us, we have a YouTube
###1899 channel where we produce a whole ton of different shows.
###1901 One of those shows is called Spoiler Alert, where we spoil
###1904 the endings of movies, TV shows, YouTube videos, and
###1906 more, all in one take and under a
###1907 certain amount of minutes.
###1908 Like, we'll ruin the endings of 100 horror
###1910 movies in four minutes.
###1912 Now that you get it, consider yourselves warned.
###1914 Last night, we stole the script to this show.
###1917 So we're about to spoil the rest of tonight's festivities
###1918 by giving away all the surprises the other acts have
###1921 in store for you.
###1921 In one take.
###1922 In under one minute.
###1923 Starting now.
###1924 Betty White gets shot out of a cannon.
###1926 Russell Brand premiers his new scarf.
###1927 Ryan Gosling finally eats all that cereal people have been
###1930 wanting him to eat.
###1930 Zach Galifianakis reveals his downstairs beard.
###1933 Kim Jong performs his new single, the Jong Song, Jong
###1936 Jong, Jong Jong Jong Jong.
###1937 Weird Al sings his version of Passion Pit's "Carried Away"
###1939 called "Married and Gay."
###1940 After taking over two movie franchises, JJ Abrams will
###1943 start an Arby's franchise and change his name to JJ Arby's.
###1945 David Blaine levitates using only the power of his mind.
###1948 John Hamm levitates using only the power of his penis.
###1950 Amanda Bynes premiers the trailer of the documentary
###1952 she's been filming all this time,
###1953 directed by Joaquin Phoenix.
###1955 Someone makes a joke about Angelina Jolie
###1956 that is far too soon.
###1958 Zooey Deschanel gets bullied for being too adorkable.
###1960 We get beat up by Zooey Deschanel at the after party
###1962 for making that stupid joke.
###1964 Everyone on this list ends up hating us forever.
###1966 We never work in Hollywood ever again.
###1967 Every day, we ponder why we ever agreed to do this.
###1969 Our life loses all meaning and we wander the streets and
###1971 ultimately become homeless.
###1972 And every day, we try to lift our spirits back up by
###1974 watching baby sloth videos through the windows at a Best
###1976 Buy to no avail.
###1977 Then we realize none of these celebrities
###1978 are even here tonight.
###1979 But here's someone who is.
###1980 Please welcome the star of his own show on
###1982 Adult Swim, Eric Andre.
###1983 
###1993 ERIC ANDRE: Thank you.
###1994 Where's the mark?
###1995 Who knows.
###1996 Am I on my mark?
###1997 I was supposed to come out on a camel, but camels fucking
###2000 hate people.
###2001 So I don't know if that fucked up their job,
###2004 but who gives a shit.
###2005 We're all going to die one day, right, Internet?
###2008 We're all going to die.
###2012 All right, I am so high right now.
###2015 I went home to Boca Raton, Florida to visit my parents.
###2020 Yeah, Boca in the house.
###2022 Boca's where your grandparents go to die, if you don't know.
###2025 It's God's waiting room.
###2028 I went home to visit my parents.
###2030 And I text messaged this girl Kerri that I used to hook up
###2033 with back in the day.
###2034 Right when I landed, I texted her, come over.
###2037 Because I am a class act gentleman that cuts straight
###2041 to the chase.
###2042 Ladies, question mark?
###2045 And she didn't respond to that.
###2047 Come over, my penis and your vagina should hang out.
###2050 She didn't respond to my subtleties.
###2053 So I wrote her again, and I was like, are you mad at me?
###2055 And then she goes, no, sorry.
###2057 I'm in Colorado with my boyfriend.
###2059 No big deal.
###2060 I didn't know she was in a different state.
###2062 I didn't know she had a boyfriend.
###2063 Pretty benign conversation, right, Asian guy
###2067 in the third row?
###2068 You know what I'm talking about?
###2071 So then, I go, come over, are you mad at me, no sorry, I'm
###2074 in Colorado with my boyfriend.
###2075 Not a big deal.
###2076 Then I get a text from a number I don't know.
###2079 Hi.
###2080 And I write, who is this?
###2082 And they go, are you a comedian?
###2084 And I'm like, yes.
###2085 Another fan, besides my mom.
###2090 Then they go, I'm Casey, Kerri's boyfriend.
###2094 Ruh roh.
###2094 And I swear to God, I'm not making this up.
###2097 I'll text each and every one of you.
###2098 Can you see that, Camera 2?
###2101 Can you see?
###2102 I'll text each and every one of you after the show.
###2103 This is a real story.
###2105 Then I'll go back to lying compulsively right afterwards.
###2107 So I'm Casey, Kerri's boyfriend.
###2110 I got a joke for you.
###2112 This guy keeps bothering my girlfriend to the point where
###2115 I get involved.
###2116 Want to know the punchline?
###2118 Keep it up.
###2119 You'll find out.
###2123 Swear to God this is a real conversation happening between
###2126 two people.
###2127 You're the most beautiful woman I've
###2128 ever seen in my life.
###2129 You know what I'm talking about.
###2131 So then I write back to the guy.
###2133 I go, what are you, dude, a bad guy from a spring break
###2136 movie from the '80s?
###2139 Because who in the fuck talks like that?
###2142 See you on the K12, Myer.
###2148 So then he writes all this shit back.
###2150 Eric, I'm normally a pretty civil guy.
###2152 You asking my girlfriend to come over?
###2154 That's funny.
###2155 We can go back and forth, but I'd rather not waste my time.
###2159 Leave Kerri alone.
###2160 Don't call her, don't text her.
###2162 Because you're not her friend, just a one hit
###2165 wonder from her past.
###2166 
###2169 I'm willing to just forget everything, including your
###2171 name, number, et cetera.
###2173 Let's end this, dot dot dot, now.
###2177 So I just put, dot dot dot, or else.
###2182 And I was like, hey man, where you texting me from?
###2184 The Cobra Kai Dojo, you fucking weirdo?
###2189 You're just a one hit wonder for her past.
###2192 That doesn't make sense in that context.
###2194 I'm sick of my girlfriend fucking all these one hit
###2197 wonders, man.
###2198 She fucked you.
###2199 She fucked Chumbawumba.
###2201 I've had enough.
###2202 
###2206 So anyway, five minutes later, I texted the
###2208 girl back, come over.
###2211 All right, thank you so much.
###2212 Good night!
###2213 
###2234 Oh man.
###2236 Fuck.
###2237 
###2254 THE GREGORY BROTHERS: Carl, hey.
###2255 Welcome back from vacation.
###2257 It was amazing, man.
###2258 Eight years in the Andes.
###2260 Es paraiso.
###2261 Wow, eight years.
###2262 Our company has the best vacation policy.
###2264 Yeah, I just feel so refreshed and ready to really focus.
###2268 Be warned.
###2270 The world has changed a lot since 2005.
###2272 Check this out.
###2274 Yeah, laptops.
###2275 I had a laptop before I moved.
###2277 Did this one come with wireless?
###2278 This isn't about laptops, Carl.
###2281 Oh.
###2281 I'm talking about YouTube, Carl.
###2284 YouTube.
###2285 
###2289 Could this be what I think it is?
###2291 Yes it is.
###2291 Holy moly.
###2292 But before you click, think real hard before you do that.
###2295 If you don't slow down, you could get whiplash.
###2297 What'd you say?
###2298 I was watching cute cats.
###2300 And have you seen the one with the little girl's rat?
###2301 Wait, hold up, don't go too fast.
###2303 Once you dive in, you can never turn back.
###2305 Life will never be the same now that I've
###2310 seen Chocolate Rain.
###2312 And I never knew a goat could scream like that, or the
###2317 simple pleasures of a pop-tart cat.
###2320 Oh, YouTube.
###2324 I can stay and play, watching Trololo for 10 hours straight.
###2327 That's a good one.
###2328 Oh, YouTube.
###2331 Refreshing PewDiePie's page, until we die of old age.
###2335 First you get sucked in by dubstep dance, then there's
###2338 people in the subway who wear no pants.
###2340 You might start small with a laughing baby, then you end up
###2342 singing with "Call Me Maybe"
###2343 I just got trigonometry, and how to put bacon in lasagna.
###2347 People share the life lesson of the [INAUDIBLE].
###2348 Or they just stuff things into a blender.
###2350 Life won't be the same again.
###2354 now that I can wait for all of it.
###2357 And I never even knew that pandas sneeze, or how my
###2362 eyebrows should be tweezed.
###2365 Oh, YouTube.
###2368 I can stay up late, watching drive-thru pranks
###2371 for 10 hours straight.
###2372 So addictive.
###2373 Oh, YouTube.
###2375 Refreshing Jenna Marbles's page until we die of old age.
###2380 How did we live life before we saw Gandalf versus Dumbledore?
###2387 I always wanted to know how a ninja fights.
###2391 Me too.
###2392 And what Pokemon would be like in real life.
###2395 Oh, YouTube.
###2398 I can stay up late, watching Jedi a-holes
###2401 for 10 hours straight.
###2402 Oh, YouTube.
###2406 Refreshing Lonely Island's page until we die of old age.
###2411 I could stay up late, watching Philly D and Ray, I could stay
###2416 up late, watching John and Hank.
###2418 Um, could you guys keep it down in here?
###2421 You've been singing for five years.
###2423 And there's some others who would like to use this room.
###2426 Oh, it's 2018.
###2427 I've got to go to a meeting, guys.
###2429 2018.
###2431 I'm retired.
###2433 
###2440 MALE SPEAKER: All right, oh man.
###2440 There's about to be too many beards on stage.
###2445 Two whole beards.
###2446 Dang it, I like that.
###2449 What am I introducing, pirates or something?
###2451 No, I'm not.
###2452 It's Reggie Watts and Beardyman.
###2453 And make some noise.
###2455

###2673 do with that dick.
###2675 Stuff it in a jar, what, come on, come on, come on.

###2681 He ain't lying, but I'm frying my brain.
###2684 Every day it's insane.
###2686 All I do is open up my head, take out my cranium, put it on
###2690 some bread.
###2691 Yeah, put some butter on it.

###2729 REGGIE WATTS: I remember the Mansen Twins.
###2731 And I just have to say that I loved all of their work up
###2734 until about '84.
###2735 BEARDYMAN: Yeah, really, they're too
###2736 much sampling, I think.
###2737 They use too much like, [MAKING LASER SOUNDS]
###2739 REGGIE WATTS: Whatever.
###2741 Fleetwood Mac did that.
###2742 
###2747 BEARDYMAN: Hey, what about this?
###2748

###2758 Can you feel it?
###2760 
###2772 Wrap it up, yo.
###2774 Everybody knows you got only certain amount of time.
###2777 If you got a do it, you can never figure out a rhyme.
###2779 If you want to do it, you can never wipe off the grime.
###2782 Grime like you're grimy, like you wouldn't ever tell me why.
###2784 Everybody, everybody knows you've got only
###2795 certain amount of time.
###2796 If you've got to do it, you can never figure out a rhyme.
###2801 
###2814 CAT: How many of you guys here have seen a cat
###2816 lick its own asshole?
###2817 Oh, that's not actually a joke.
###2819 I'm just trying to keep heads of who's a
###2821 fucking pervert here.
###2823 
###2829 IAN HECOX: Hey.
###2830 I'm Ian.
###2831 ANTHONY PADILLA: And I'm Anthony.
###2833 And when we were asked to appear at this live event, we
###2836 were like, what do you want us to do?
###2838 IAN HECOX: And they said, be yourselves.
###2840 ANTHONY PADILLA: We said, OK.
###2843 So now we're going to give you a tutorial about how to
###2846 introduce a guest on a live show.
###2848 IAN HECOX: First, you have to upload a video
###2851 to YouTube in 2005.
###2853 ANTHONY PADILLA: Very important.
###2854 IAN HECOX: And then you just keep making videos.
###2857 Doesn't really matter what they are.
###2858 Lip sync videos, videos about video games, whatever, as long
###2862 as they kick ass.
###2863 ANTHONY PADILLA: Step Two, have awesome hair.
###2866 If you have great hair, people want to watch you.
###2868 Sometimes they want to touch you inappropriately.
###2870 John Stamos knows what I'm talking about.
###2872 That guy has had great hair forever.
###2874 IAN HECOX: Dude, totally.
###2875 ANTHONY PADILLA: Full House?
###2876 IAN HECOX: Yeah.
###2876 ANTHONY PADILLA: That.
###2878 IAN HECOX: Step Three is be booked on a live show.
###2880 And this is kind of important.
###2882 ANTHONY PADILLA: Arguably the most important part.
###2884 IAN HECOX: And I mean, you can't just get up here and do
###2887 something crazy.
###2888 You're not Kanye.
###2888 So don't fucking do that.
###2891 ANTHONY PADILLA: Oh, yeah.
###2892 Have a good rapport with your partner.
###2895 What's up?
###2895 IAN HECOX: What's up?
###2897 ANTHONY PADILLA: All right, check.
###2898 And most importantly, introduce the person together.
###2901 IAN HECOX: All right.
###2902 Ladies and gentlemen, put your hands
###2904 together for Kyle Kinane.
###2906 
###2920 KYLE KINANE: Good with their music.
###2921 How's it going, guys?
###2923 YouTube, huh?
###2925 Did you see that cat earlier with the tongue?
###2928 It was adorable.
###2929 It was like it had a little kitten stroke.
###2931 That's nice.
###2932 Let's exploit that, YouTube.
###2934 Looking forward to all the 14-year-old dick heads calling
###2937 me a homo in the comments section after this.
###2940 That's what we're going to get.
###2942 YouTube, where Christians go to see tits.
###2944 OK.
###2946 
###2948 I'll make it quick.
###2949 I'll just check the barometer of the room.
###2952 See if you'll get along with me.
###2953 I'll just let you know about myself.
###2956 Last Sunday, I picked my nose.
###2961 It's what you do.
###2962 It happens, right?
###2963 It's your finger, it's your nose.
###2964 They fit.
###2964 Why not, go for it.
###2966 Love yourself.
###2969 And I didn't want to wipe it on my couch, because I'm not
###2973 an asshole.
###2975 I was too lazy to go and get up and get a Kleenex.
###2979 So I put it back in my nose.
###2982 
###2985 If you think that's funny, we're going to get along for
###2988 the next five minutes.
###2990 If not, maybe you want to go to the bathroom and grab a
###2992 smoke break.
###2993 I don't know.
###2994 I recently experienced a defeat disguised as a victory.
###2998 I don't know if it's ever happened to you.
###2999 My friend was like, what do got going on tomorrow morning?
###3002 I was like, I don't have to wake up for nothing.
###3004 
###3010 I don't have to wake up for nothing.
###3012 Literally nothing requires my existence tomorrow.
###3016 Tomorrow, I could just not be.
###3019 That's like an optimistic way to say, what do you got going
###3021 on tomorrow morning?
###3022 I could die in my sleep.
###3023 It wouldn't matter.
###3025 Awesome.
###3027 This is a fancy show.
###3028 I don't think I belong.
###3029 I feel like a fart in a tuxedo up here.
###3032 This is nice.
###3034 For more information about me, I just stopped getting
###3038 diarrhea, which would be great, but I
###3042 didn't change my lifestyle.
###3044 You know how you drive your car around with the check
###3047 engine light?
###3047 And then the check engine light goes off, but you didn't
###3050 fix your car?
###3053 That just means that that's my body's way of saying, you're
###3055 not heeding warning signs.
###3057 Enjoy the last six months of your life.
###3059 That's what we'll get into.
###3062 I don't know.
###3063 Like socially, this should make it easier to be social,
###3066 stuff like this.
###3067 You go out, you talk to people every night.
###3069 It should be getting easier.
###3070 But instead, more and more, I just feel like I'm backed into
###3072 a corner with bright lights on me, and I'm just trying to
###3074 defend myself.
###3075 Like every night's an away gave, you know?
###3078 This is where I'm at socially.
###3079 Not too long ago, I said God bless you to a cat.
###3083 It's not like I was in a room with people and cats and I
###3087 heard a sneeze, and my gentlemanly
###3089 instinct kicked in.
###3090 I was just alone in a room with a cat, which was already
###3094 a day in my life.
###3095 I'm just alone, not my room, not my cat, just sitting on a
###3098 futon with a cat.
###3100 He's looking one way, I'm looking the other.
###3101 We're just looking for answers, you know?
###3105 The cat sneezed.
###3107 And then it was quiet.
###3108 And that made me feel uncomfortable.
###3111 Because I was raised right.
###3114 So I was like, I should say something.
###3116 I'm like, but it's a cat.
###3117 Yeah, but we're all God's creatures.
###3119 So I'm like, all right, I'm going for it.
###3121 And I was like, God bless you.
###3122 And the cat looked at me.
###3123 Because that's what they do.
###3124 Cats look at the origins of sounds.
###3126 But they also have very, very judgmental faces.
###3130 So this cat looked at me.
###3131 And instantly, I knew it was like, listen man, I think you
###3135 say stuff like God bless you.
###3136 You know I don't have a belief system put into place that
###3139 would require you to mention some sort of deity.
###3142 I think you say these things to convince yourself that
###3144 you're a good person, with your pleases
###3146 and your thank yous.
###3147 But deep down, you're trying to hide some darkness.
###3149 That's what you're saying there.
###3150 Furthermore, I was worshipped in ancient Egypt as a god.
###3153 If I need to bless myself, I can bless myself.
###3156 That's how it works with me.
###3157 It actually comes in very handy.
###3159 I sneeze all the time.
###3160 I'm covered in cat hair.
###3161 And my response to that was like, well then, go fuck
###3163 yourself, cat.
###3165 But if you were just a fly on the wall, you just saw me in a
###3169 room go, God bless you, cat.
###3170 Go fuck yourself, cat.
###3172 And that's why I don't socialize well.
###3174 That's why this is getting more and more
###3175 difficult for me.
###3179 I was on an elevator.
###3181 Guy got on the elevator, regular looking dude.
###3184 And doors closed.
###3186 And he looked at me, said, you smell nice.
###3188 And I said, thank you.
###3190 Because I don't hear that ever.
###3193 I smell how I look.
###3195 That's this.
###3196 I don't hear compliments.
###3197 I hear comments.
###3198 I hear people commenting on the general odor of the area,
###3201 stuff like, who would leave taquitos in a golf shoe like
###3204 that anyway?
###3205 I hear that kind of stuff.
###3206 It's not Old Spice.
###3207 It's old spices.
###3209 It's expired seasonings, some paprika that somebody kicked
###3212 under the stove seven years ago.
###3214 That could be it.
###3216 So I said, thank you.
###3217 But then this guy, then he kind of showed his cards a bit
###3220 with the whole thing.
###3221 Because then he kind of gets a different look.
###3224 He goes, you just get out of the shower?
###3227 OK, all right, that's a bit forward.
###3230 That's a man with a plan.
###3232 Now, whereas somebody else should take that as a warning
###3234 and be like, this guy's got something up, I was excited
###3236 for the opportunity of conversation, I just went off.
###3239 I'm like, what do you smell?
###3240 Is it lavender?
###3241 Is it lavender?
###3242 I'm using a new face scrub that's lavender.
###3244 People are saying it's very overpowering.
###3246 They're mistaking it for a whole shower.
###3247 But really, it's just my face.
###3249 Tell me, is it lavender?
###3250 And he just left the elevator.
###3253 And that's when I realized that I had out creeped a
###3256 creeper in that moment.
###3257 That's what I had done.
###3258 My own desperation became a form of self-defense, when I
###3262 became too much work for a pervert.
###3264 That's what happened.
###3265 This guy's like, this guy's just going to chew through the
###3267 whole gag and ruin the van ride.
###3270 I don't have all day.
###3271 I just wanted a hump and dump.
###3274 I'm still waving through the closing doors, where you
###3276 going, new friend?
###3277 Don't you want to watch "Silver
###3278 Linings Playbook" together?
###3280 All right, that's it for me.
###3282 Have a good night.
###3282 Thanks.
###3284 
###3313 SHANE DAWSON: Hi.
###3313 My name is Shane Dawson.
###3315 And I've been making videos on YouTube since 2006.
###3318 And a lot's changed since then.
###3320 Back in '06, the only form of comedy on YouTube was a
###3323 toddler playfully nibbling on his brother's finger, and a
###3326 big fat black woman falling on a coffee table and
###3328 breaking her ass.
###3330 And now, we've moved on to bigger and better things, like
###3333 a different big fat black woman choking on cinnamon
###3335 until she almost dies, and a bunch of tweenagers shoving
###3338 condoms up their nose, trying to sniff them into their nasal
###3341 cavities and then pull them out of their mouths.
###3344 That's a real thing.
###3345 I've done it.
###3346 It works.
###3348 Everybody, YouTube has evolved.
###3349 And I think it deserves a slow clap.
###3351 Come on, everybody.
###3353 Too fast, too fast.
###3355 So tweenagers, take those condoms out of your nose and
###3357 your mouth.
###3358 You're going to need them.
###3359 Because here is Three Loco.
###3360 
###3366 THREE LOCO: Oh my goodness.
###3367 
###3373 Step in the club, and we're looking real neato.
###3376 I'll be getting bitches in my blue tuxedo.
###3378 We're neato, like a giraffe in a speedo.
###3381 What's up, sonny?
###3383 Que pasa, mijo?
###3385 Chilling with Rihanna out in Puerto Rico.
###3387 She ate my coconut, because she thought it was a Zico.
###3391 I beat up the block like Steven Seagal, pour a four in
###3393 a Pellegrino, driving backwards through Reno.
###3396 Pointy sided Dorito, go ahead, shoot the free throw.
###3399 I pull up at the casino, candy Cheetos steamboat.
###3402 Desert Eagle, I flash the Buick Regal.
###3404 I pull up on you people, buttercream Beetle.
###3407 Neato, neato, neat, neat, neato.
###3409 Neato, neato, neat, neat, neato.
###3412 We're neato.
###3413 Look Mom, we're neato.
###3415 Look kids, we're neato.
###3417 We're really neato.
###3418 Neato.
###3420 In the El Camino, I'm back, yeah, tight like burrito.
###3424 Pull on the place, a 10 cent casino.
###3426 Next year, I'm in the movie, Quentin Tarantino.
###3429 Coast of Puerto Rico, pizza Totino.
###3432 You got a low self-esteem?
###3433 You can rent my ego.
###3435 Neato, burrito, hold the chorizo.
###3438 Snitches get stitches, shout out to Lilo.
###3441 Fuck cocaine, my cock's like a kilo.
###3444 And you know I be stacking more dough than phyllo.
###3447 Your momma sucked my dick, tell her,
###3448 keep it on the d-low.
###3449 I keep it underground.
###3450 You're commercial like Vevo.
###3452 Neato, neato, neat, neat, neato.
###3455 Neato, neato, neat, neat, neato.
###3457 We're neato.
###3459 Look Mom, we're neato.
###3461 Look kids, we're neato.
###3462 We're really neato.
###3463 Neato, neato, neat, neat, neato.
###3466 Get it Andy, get it.
###3468 Throw it.
###3469 We're neato, we're neato.
###3471 Look Mom, we're neato.
###3472 
###3475 Neato, butt naked in the El Camino.
###3477 I'm white like Berry, not brown like Nino.
###3480 Dirt Nasty, don't ask me what's neat while I'm shitting
###3483 on the track like Waka Flocka Seagulls.
###3486 Evil, don't look through the peephole unless you want to
###3489 see your grandma sitting on my meat pole.
###3492 Locked up in Chino, got shanked by a Latino for a bag
###3494 for a bag of Hot Fritos.
###3496 My dick mas piquito.
###3497 Neato, still whip it like Devo because my dick's short and
###3500 fat like Danny DeVito.
###3503 Barely legal, hotter than a jalapeno, as she dropped to
###3507 her knees and did the Tim Tebow.
###3508 Neato, neato, neat, neat, neato.
###3511 Neato, neato, neat, neat, neato.
###3514 We're neato, we're neato.
###3516 Look Mom, we're neato.
###3518 Look kids, we're neato.
###3520 Neato, neato, neat, neat, neato.
###3523 Neato, neato, neat, neat, neato.
###3526 We're neato, we're neato, look Mom, we're neato.
###3529 
###3531 Nik Nikateen, what, neato.
###3534 Going crazy out here.
###3536 Fuck you.
###3537 Tear that shit down.
###3538 Tear it down.
###3538 YouTube, I got a new video on YouTube with a
###3542 picture of my dick.
###3543 It got 10 million views.
###3545 Tear all that shit down.
###3546 We love you, YouTube.
###3547 
###3552 BEN SCHWARTZ: Owen Wilson.
###3553 OWEN WILSON: How you doing?
###3554 BEN SCHWARTZ: Vince Vaughn.
###3555 VINCE VAUGHN: How are you?
###3556 BEN SCHWARTZ: Come on, baby, the hottest
###3557 comedy duo there is.
###3558 The heat from you guys.
###3559 Wedding Crashers, enormous.
###3560 What I'm trying to do is to get you guys as the red hot
###3563 duo in a new movie.
###3564 What do you think?
###3565 You like this idea?
###3566 OWEN WILSON: Yeah, it makes sense.
###3567 BEN SCHWARTZ: Vin?
###3568 VINCE VAUGHN: Do you have a good idea?
###3569 BEN SCHWARTZ: I've got a project for you
###3570 that you might love.
###3571 It's called "The Hobbit." Enjoy it.
###3574 Read it.
###3575 OWEN WILSON: "The Hobbit."
###3576 BEN SCHWARTZ: "The Hobbit."
###3577 VINCE VAUGHN: I don't understand what
###3577 you're talking about.
###3578 BEN SCHWARTZ: OK, buddy comedy, right?
###3579 VINCE VAUGHN: It's not a buddy comedy.
###3580 I don't want to step on your feet here.
###3582 BEN SCHWARTZ: Hold up, you don't want to step on what?
###3583 VINCE VAUGHN: Hold on.
###3586 BEN SCHWARTZ: So that's it.
###3587 So we got our movie.
###3588 Do I just say green light it?
###3589 VINCE VAUGHN: No.
###3589 I'm not doing "The Hobbit."
###3590 BEN SCHWARTZ: Sean, we'll call you back.
###3591 So not "The Hobbit"?
###3592 Not "The Hobbit." But tell me why.
###3593 Is it because of a timing thing?
###3595 VINCE VAUGHN: I think, look, I'm a tall guy.
###3597 And hobbits are small.
###3598 And it doesn't make any sense.
###3598 OWEN WILSON: I guess somebody should let Eddie Murphy know
###3600 he can't play a clone.
###3602 And he can't play the white guy in the barber shop scene
###3604 in "Coming to America."
###3604 BEN SCHWARTZ: And I would say Dustin Hoffman's not a woman,
###3606 but he played Tootsie.
###3607 You can do this, VV.
###3608 You know what I mean?
###3609 OWEN WILSON: He does raise a good point.
###3610 It's about dreaming.
###3611 That's what film's about.
###3612 VINCE VAUGHN: I understand, Owen.
###3613 OWEN WILSON: We let ourselves dream a little.
###3614 VINCE VAUGHN: It's not a buddy comedy for me and you.
###3615 OWEN WILSON: You know what hobbits have?
###3617 Heart.
###3618 BEN SCHWARTZ: Oh God.
###3619 OWEN WILSON: This guy has heart.
###3620 BEN SCHWARTZ: Yeah, what about that?
###3621 OWEN WILSON: And he can play it.
###3622 BEN SCHWARTZ: So what about that?
###3623 Let you heart shine and become a tiny guy.
###3624 OWEN WILSON: I love the idea.
###3625 I love the idea of playing Gandalf.
###3627 But throw out some other ideas.
###3628 You're right, you're right.
###3629 BEN SCHWARTZ: You know what it is?
###3630 Maybe do a period piece, huh?
###3631 About a president.
###3632 About the president.
###3633 OWEN WILSON: Lincoln.
###3633 BEN SCHWARTZ: Oh!
###3634 OWEN WILSON: Guess who's from Illinois?
###3635 BEN SCHWARTZ: I can't imagine it's Vince Vaughn.
###3637 OWEN WILSON: Yeah.
###3637 BEN SCHWARTZ: No, man.
###3637 VINCE VAUGHN: I just don't think--
###3638 OWEN WILSON: You can't say you're too big to play that.
###3640 BEN SCHWARTZ: Put this on for me, just for a minute.
###3642 VINCE VAUGHN: No.
###3642 OWEN WILSON: Come on.
###3643 BEN SCHWARTZ: Oh!
###3644 Oh, do you hear that?
###3646 The office just turned oval.
###3647 I feel like I'm staring at the president right now.
###3648 Just say four score.
###3650 OWEN WILSON: Although, how would that be a buddy movie?
###3652 BEN SCHWARTZ: Easy.
###3652 John Wilkes Booth.
###3653 Abraham Lincoln.
###3654 VINCE VAUGHN: OK, John Wilkes Booth and Abraham Lincoln were
###3656 not buddies.
###3656 One was an assassin.
###3657 OWEN WILSON: No, no, but it gives us an arc.
###3660 It gives us some place to go to.
###3661 BEN SCHWARTZ: OK, then we re-route it, easily.
###3663 We make them roommates.
###3664 Makes them buddies.
###3665 VINCE VAUGHN: John Wilkes Booth kills Lincoln.
###3666 It's not a buddy comedy.
###3667 BEN SCHWARTZ: Give me a little improv maybe.
###3668 Maybe you guys lived together.
###3669 Give me some of that riff magic you guys do when like,
###3671 Vinnie says like, uh, sarcastic, and then Owen goes,
###3674 but I'm a hippie.
###3675 Give me some of that stuff, OK?
###3676 You're Abraham Lincoln.
###3678 You've gotta smile for me, Vinnie, Jesus
###3679 Christ, a tiny bit.
###3681 Use it.
###3681 That's great.
###3682 And then Owen, you're John Wilkes Booth.
###3684 You can initiate it.
###3684 Is that impossible?
###3685 OWEN WILSON: Yeah, let's try this one.
###3688 You know, I have a big date tonight.
###3691 And I need my lucky hat.
###3693 I can't find it.
###3694 It's this hat.
###3695 Where would it be?
###3696 VINCE VAUGHN: Here's you hat.
###3696 Here's your hat, roommate.
###3697 Take it.
###3697 OWEN WILSON: Here we go.
###3700 And scene.
###3701 Yeah, OK, but now let me play Gandalf.
###3702 BEN SCHWARTZ: Right into it.
###3703 OWEN WILSON: Give me a better hat, though.
###3704 BEN SCHWARTZ: Gandalf, plop that on and see what happens.
###3705 OWEN WILSON: OK, put this on.
###3706 BEN SCHWARTZ: Go, go, go.
###3707 VINCE VAUGHN: Honestly.
###3708 OWEN WILSON: Give me a pipe.
###3708 Because I'm going to smoke some of that Buckshire weed.
###3711 OK.
###3712 Oh, oh, where's my little hobbit friend?
###3718 BEN SCHWARTZ: Yeah, talk like an old
###3719 Jewish man, that's good.
###3719 Good, good, good.
###3720 OWEN WILSON: Where's my little hobbit friend?
###3721 BEN SCHWARTZ: And Vin, you enter as the hobbit friend.
###3722 OWEN WILSON: Oh, there he is.
###3723 That's the biggest hobbit I've ever seen.
###3725 
###3728 BEN SCHWARTZ: Vin, yeah?
###3729 Should we just say yes to this, or no?
###3731 Just tell me.
###3731 Let's put it on speaker phone.
###3732 VINCE VAUGHN: I just don't know what we're doing here.
###3734 OWEN WILSON: Oh God.
###3734 It's so exhausting to just like try and just be tap
###3737 dancing like Fred Astaire and have this guy
###3739 be like Doctor No.
###3740 You're nothing without your energy, your enthusiasm.
###3742 VINCE VAUGHN: I think that it's crazy.
###3743 I think it's crazy.
###3744 I think I'm wasting my day.
###3745 BEN SCHWARTZ: Crazy good?
###3745 Finish your sentences.
###3747 VINCE VAUGHN: Crazy terrible.
###3748 BEN SCHWARTZ: Crazy terrible, I know.
###3748 What about "48 Hours"?
###3749 VINCE VAUGHN: I love "48 Hours." We're not going to
###3751 remake "48 Hours."
###3751 BEN SCHWARTZ: Of course we're not.
###3751 We're going to make our own original movie that has
###3753 nothing to do with that, "41 Hours."
###3754 VINCE VAUGHN: Is there a camera or something in here?
###3755 Is this a joke?
###3757 BEN SCHWARTZ: There is a camera right there.
###3758 But it's for my wife to make sure I'm not cheating on her.
###3760 It has nothing to do with filming you guys.
###3761 I wouldn't cheat on her.
###3762 VINCE VAUGHN: Do you have any original ideas?
###3763 BEN SCHWARTZ: I do.
###3763 VINCE VAUGHN: I love your enthusiasm.
###3765 I don't mean to be a downer.
###3766 So far we have "The Hobbit," which I don't think is-- let's
###3768 just refresh.
###3768 Not a buddy comedy.
###3770 OWEN WILSON: Take the dream, put it away.
###3771 VINCE VAUGHN: Lincoln, Lincoln, Lincoln with John
###3773 Wilkes Booth?
###3774 Not a buddy comedy.
###3775 BEN SCHWARTZ: Not yet.
###3776 VINCE VAUGHN: Not ever.
###3776 BEN SCHWARTZ: We'll pass.
###3777 We'll pass.
###3779 VINCE VAUGHN: And now we're talking about remaking "48
###3780 Hours" but making it "42 Hours"?
###3781 BEN SCHWARTZ: Ooh, did I already say that?
###3783 VINCE VAUGHN: Yeah.
###3784 BEN SCHWARTZ: Oh.
###3784 It's a great idea.
###3784 VINCE VAUGHN: No.
###3785 BEN SCHWARTZ: No, it isn't.
###3785 I'm kidding.
###3786 VINCE VAUGHN: OK.
###3786 So what we need is just some simple kind of fun idea with a
###3788 fun world to go into, comedy.
###3790 I'm happy to hear an idea.
###3792 But I honestly gotta get out of here.
###3793 BEN SCHWARTZ: But there's no watch on your wrist.
###3794 VINCE VAUGHN: I know there's not.
###3794 But I gotta get out of here.
###3795 BEN SCHWARTZ: Two friends, OK?
###3797 Already this is amazing, right, that crash weddings.
###3799 
###3802 VINCE VAUGHN: Let's go.
###3804 BEN SCHWARTZ: It was great to see you.
###3805 Thanks for coming in.
###3805 We'll just reschedule.
###3807 OK.
###3808 Is this a no, or loosely attached?
###3810 OWEN WILSON: Loosely attached.
###3813 BEN SCHWARTZ: Hey Owen.
###3814 
###3823 VINCE VAUGHN: Thank you.
###3826 Thank you very much.
###3829 Thank you.
###3831 Very nice to be here at the big show here.
###3833 And yes, it's true.
###3834 There was a lot of ideas thrown at me and Owen after
###3838 "Wedding Crashers." And none of them really made any sense.
###3841 It seems like there's a lot of sequels and stuff.
###3843 So it's nice to actually have an idea and a movie actually
###3846 about something.
###3847 And the movie's very funny.
###3848 But it's also very timely.
###3850 And it's very nice to be with this crowd.
###3852 This is an attractive crowd.
###3853 This is a hungry crowd.
###3855 
###3857 And this is a sexual crowd.
###3859 I know what's going on here.
###3861 I know what's going on.
###3862 All right, guys, thank you very much.
###3864 I'm proud of you.
###3866 Thank you.
###3867 I mean it.
###3868 I'm proud of you.
###3870 Thank you.
###3871 Thank you.
###3872 
###3896 ANDY SAMBERG: Hey.
###3897 So next up is a video written by and starring a 2008 prime
###3901 time Emmy nominee for outstanding guest actress in a
###3904 comedy series for her role as Marcy Maven on "Monk."
###3907 JORMA TACCONE: You may remember her from the
###3909 beginning of the show.
###3910 She's the queen of jeans.
###3912 AKIVA SCHAFFER: The Hoodie McGoodie.
###3913 ANDY SAMBERG: The bee's knees.
###3915 JORMA TACCONE: The crocodile's butt hole.

###3931 Stay at home, order in, watch a movie, then masturbate.
###3939 And I'm not going out to the club.
###3942 Like I've ever even been to a club.

###3950 
###3954 WILL.I.AM: It's a perfect night.
###3956 It's a perfect night.
###3957 Tonight's the night.
###3959 It's going to be right.
###3959 It's the perfect night.
###3960 SARAH SILVERMAN: I'm staying home by myself, don't need
###3963 anybody else.
###3964 It's just me, myself, and I with my puppy by my side.
###3968 Got my phone for clever Tweeting.
###3970 I just followed Michael Keaton.
###3972 And I'm tired and I'm lazy.
###3974 Shit's about tonight get crazy.
###3976 WILL.I.AM: Yeah, she walking in sweatpants.
###3978 And she watering them plants.
###3979 And she ordering food because she's not in the mood to wash
###3982 all them pans.
###3983 Now she taking a bong hit.
###3985 And she shaving her armpits.
###3987 Now she looking for something that she
###3989 wanna watch on Netflix.
###3991 SARAH SILVERMAN: Tonight is the night
###3993 I'm going to celebrate.
###3997 Stay at home, order in, watch a movie, then masturbate.
###4005 And you won't find me out at the store.
###4007 Because I'll never even walk out the door.
###4012 But I got a feeling this is going to be the perfect night.
###4017 
###4020 Don't need no heavy bass.
###4022 WILL.I.AM: Like a club.
###4023 SARAH SILVERMAN: Just need to watch my face.
###4024 WILL.I.AM: Scrub a dub.
###4025 SARAH SILVERMAN: Floss my teeth, take a puff,
###4026 and brush my teeth.
###4028 Don't need no heavy bass.
###4029 WILL.I.AM: No bass.
###4030 SARAH SILVERMAN: This ain't the time or place.
###4031 WILL.I.AM: No, it ain't.
###4032 SARAH SILVERMAN: I floss my teeth then take a puff then I
###4035 brush my teeth.
###4036 WILL.I.AM: Teeth.
###4036 SARAH SILVERMAN: Drink some coconut water because
###4038 hydration is so ill.
###4040 Then I have a Dove Sensation and I give my dog his pill.
###4044 Almost ready for my beddie, put some Palmer's on my skin.
###4048 Put a YouPorn on my iPhone and I type my search words in.
###4052 Gang, amateur, cum, high fives.
###4059 I got a feeling this is going to be a perfect night.
###4063 
###4066 I got a feeling this is going to be a perfect night.
###4070 
###4074 MALE SPEAKER: Wow.
###4076 
###4081 I don't remember school being this cool.
###4083 Does that say that?
###4088 It's an epic rap battle.
###4091 Sorry.
###4092 It's the Epic Rap Battles of History.
###4093 
###4107 SKRILLEX: My name is Skrillex, man.
###4108 Welcome to the Devil's Den.
###4109 I'm a scary monster stomping this bright and frilly pant.
###4112 You're a weirdo, wolfie, into powdered wigs and poof.
###4115 And your cousin blew notes on your little magic flute.
###4119 Your daddy makes the Jackson 5 look like "The Family Circus,"
###4122 you might have been a genius.
###4123 But you died broke and worthless.
###4125 I'm rich.
###4126 My claim to fame is I'm a playlist, I'm the A list.
###4129 You're the vainest.
###4130 Kiss my ass, Amadeus.
###4131 AMADEUS: Was that a verse or did you just get the hiccups?
###4134 I'm a prodigy, son.
###4135 And I'm about to smack a bitch up.
###4137 My music is 200 years old, and it's still excellent.
###4140 Two more months, the world will forget about your
###4142 Skrillexcrement.
###4143 Look at how you dress when you dubstep out of the house.
###4146 You're an emo Steve Urkel and you reek of deadmau5.
###4149 I am the world's greatest composer.
###4151 No one knows what you are, except a lonely little troll
###4153 who knows how to press a space bar.
###4155 SKRILLEX: I attack, you decay.
###4156 Can't sustain my releases.
###4158 Sad chain, Wolfgang, Bangarang you to pieces.
###4161 I'm a self-made man, you're a slave to your pappa.
###4164 I'm a rock star.
###4166 Mix you with the bass and the drop ya.
###4167 
###4181 Global, my strobes glow like Chernobyl.
###4183 Kids explode and get mobile.
###4185 No one even knows you.
###4187 I make the whole world move.
###4189 You play community theater.
###4190 I gained your same fame from home on a blown out speaker.
###4193 AMADEUS: Oh yes, I heard that EP, and see, I
###4195 transcribed it here.
###4196 Tell me, what comes after the 68th measure of diarrhea?
###4199 What kind of drugs does it take to enjoy this?
###4202 No idea.
###4202 I've seen more complexity in a couch from IKEA.
###4206 From piano to fortissimo, that means soft to very loud,
###4210 because I'm guessing that you didn't know.
###4212 Put down your Cubase and pick up a real bow.
###4214 I rocked harder than you when I was five years old!
###4219 MALE SPEAKER: Who won?
###4220 Who's next?
###4221 You decide.
###4224 Epic Rap Battles of History!
###4231 [APPLAUSE]
###4247 [HONKING NOISE]
###4257 MALE SPEAKER: YouTube sensation Toby Turner.
###4259 Oh, I didn't know he was going to be here.
###4261 Toby Turner!
###4264 TOBY TURNER: Hi.
###4266 This is a dramatic song I wrote.
###4269 It's actually called Dramatic Song.
###4272 Title just came to me.
###4274 It felt right.
###4278 This song sounds dramatic, but I'm bad at writing the words.
###4284 If you don't speak English, this probably
###4286 sounds pretty good.
###4288 You probably think I'm singing about some
###4291 pretty serious stuff.
###4293 But in reality, I'm singing about the lack of stuff I'm
###4297 singing about.
###4298 This part's intense and emotional, as long as you
###4304 don't understand it.
###4306 Your foreign grandma would love this song.
###4310 Please send it to her.
###4313 And she'll probably tell her foreign friends about this
###4316 song her grandson or doctor sent her today.
###4319 This song might hit charts in a country if parts sounded
###4322 like Coldplay, if the chorus sounds like Coldplay.
###4333 Then I put some la la la's in there, la la la
###4339 la, la la la la.
###4342 Hopefully your foreign grandma listens to
###4344 this song every day.
###4345 And if she asks you to translate the lyrics, here's
###4349 what you say.
###4350 A perfect translation does not exist.
###4355 Well, at least, not in your language.
###4359 But if you must know, well, picture this.
###4364 50 billion rainbows and the sun is setting and the moon is
###4368 setting also, and you're there in a gazebo.
###4371 And then God descends from heaven and he gives you a
###4375 million dollars.
###4376 Take that feeling.
###4378 And put it into a song.
###4381 I could translate word by word, but
###4384 that'd take too long.
###4385 And I've got stuff to do, Grandma.
###4387 I don't have time for this.
###4390 You gotta trust me, Grandma.
###4392 This freaking song is the shhh.
###4398 Thanks.
###4399 
###4407 This is not another song.
###4408 It's just the intro to the next performer, whose
###4412 name is John Dore.
###4413 John Dore, John Dore, John Dore.
###4418 Ladies and gentlemen, John Dore.
###4420 
###4440 JOHN DORE: Wow.
###4441 What a beautiful introduction.
###4442 And to everyone out there watching YouTube who aren't
###4446 watching the TV sets, the Ottawa Senators did just tie
###4450 the game to put it into overtime.
###4453 No one gives a shit.
###4454 I understand, I understand.
###4456 But I do.
###4457 I care about a lot of things.
###4458 And I don't know if you've ever seen a video of a baby
###4461 giraffe getting born, but it's the most horrifying thing
###4465 you'll ever see in your life.
###4467 It's not like the mother helps.
###4469 Doesn't lie down.
###4470 The mother stands straight up.
###4472 It's like watching a baby fall out a three story window.
###4475 And then have to fight its way out of a gelatinous sac.
###4478 It's disgusting.
###4480 So I've written a song on behalf of the baby giraffe.
###4483 And I hope you like it.
###4484 It's called Mama, Bend Yo' Knees.
###4486 
###4516 It needs lyrics.
###4517 There's no question.
###4517 But I like it.
###4519 
###4522 That's a great song.
###4524 It really captures the spirit of the baby giraffe.
###4527 
###4531 When I was in the 11th grade, was I in my friend Jeff's
###4535 basement, and did he give me a bottle of beer?
###4538 Yes, he did.
###4539 Did I chug the beer?
###4540 Yes, I did.
###4541 Afterwards, Jeff started laughing.
###4543 And I said, Jeffrey, what amuses you so?
###4546 And true story, Jeff had put two tabs of acid in my beer.
###4550 Fact.
###4551 For the next half hour, I was fucking furious.
###4553 For the next six hours, I was the Lizard King.
###4556 And that is also a fact.
###4557 It can be checked.
###4558 I'm not trying to be cute.
###4559 But then I had to explain to my innocent, non-drug abusing
###4562 girlfriend Melissa that I'd just taken two tabs of acid.
###4565 And that is this same thing as trying to explain to someone
###4568 you're about to become a werewolf.
###4569 There's no difference.
###4570 
###4573 Melissa, you should go.
###4579 I'm going to be different soon.
###4582 We never found her body.
###4585 No, you didn't let me finish.
###4586 We never found her body again.
###4589 Now, I don't have a lot of time up here.
###4590 But I'll tell you this.
###4591 YouTube did ask me if I would do one of my
###4594 classic YouTube jokes.
###4596 So here it is for you, one of my classic YouTube jokes.
###4600 Last week, I went out with a lovely lady.
###4602 And I used the date rape drug for the first time.
###4606 But you know what?
###4607 It just made me really tired.
###4610 Like, I'm not taking that pill again.
###4612 Part way through the date, I'm getting drowsy.
###4614 It's like, I'm not going to get any raping done like this.
###4617 I'm exhausted.
###4618 Classic YouTube joke.
###4621 But you know what?
###4621 It wasn't always that way.
###4623 That is the final edited product, all right?
###4625 But it went through a lot of different forms of evolution
###4629 to become that perfect, concise joke.
###4631 And I thought for fun tonight, I'd give you a couple of
###4633 examples of how that joke used to go.
###4635 I remember the first time I told it, it went like this.
###4638 Hey, everyone.
###4639 I went out with a girl recently.
###4641 And I gave her--
###4643 or gave me, I gave her the date rope, not
###4646 rope, rape, no, rope.
###4647 I wish I had a rope.
###4648 I'd strangle myself.
###4649 So it went like that the first time.
###4650 Wasn't very good.
###4651 I was very nervous, very young.
###4653 I remember one time, I was performing in a pool hall.
###4655 And people were playing billiards, and the
###4658 joke went like this.
###4661 Well, last week I went out with a lovely lady.
###4663 And I used the date--
###4664 
###4667 um--
###4668 
###4670 sorry, sorry everyone.
###4671 Last week, I went out with a lovely lady.
###4673 And I used the uh-- oh fuck, come on.
###4677 Guys, enough with the billiards.
###4680 I'm trying to tell jokes up here, all right?
###4682 Just leave it.
###4683 Professional on stage, OK?
###4686 Idiots.
###4687 Anyway, last week I went out with a lovely lady and I used
###4690 the-- what are you doing?
###4692 Oh my God.
###4693 I didn't mean anything.
###4694 I didn't mean anything.
###4695 Ow.
###4696 
###4700 MALE SPEAKER: Who's funny now?
###4701 JOHN DORE: I didn't mean it.
###4702 I didn't mean it.
###4703 I was just trying to tell a joke.
###4706 Don't put that up my butt.
###4707 Don't put it up my butt.
###4708 
###4711 Give me--
###4713 ahh!
###4714 
###4720 CARLIE MARGOLIS: YouTube is the latest video website to
###4723 jump into the original programming arena.
###4725 The site recently announced its first high profile long
###4727 form venture, a 13 episode dramatic adaptation of the
###4730 popular video Turtle Has Sex with Shoes.
###4733 Acclaimed director David Fincher has signed on to
###4735 direct the hour long pilot, which will reunite him with
###4737 Fight Club star Edward Norton, who's been cast as a high
###4740 powered New York City attorney who owns a turtle and a pair
###4743 of sneakers.
###4744 According to New York Times media analyst David Carr,
###4746 quote, "This is the future of television.
###4748 YouTube did extensive research to find out what their users
###4750 want to see.
###4751 Turns out, it's 13 hours of a turtle having sex with shoes
###4753 that you can watch in one sitting." In addition to
###4755 Norton, the series will costar Rosario Dawson as a
###4758 no-nonsense district attorney, and Academy Award nominee Paul
###4761 Giamatti as the passionate, grunting voice of the turtle
###4763 who has sex with Mr. Norton's shoes.
###4765 When asked what attracted him to this project, Fincher told
###4768 Rolling Stone, quote, "This is the dream
###4770 come true for a filmmaker.
###4771 When I saw the original video, my immediate thoughts were,
###4773 who is this turtle?
###4774 Why is it having sex with this shoe?
###4776 Where is this taking place?
###4777 YouTube is allowing us to tell a very dark, compelling story
###4780 here."
###4781 While the full 13 episode first season won't be released
###4783 until this fall, YouTube has unveiled a teaser
###4786 trailer for the show.
###4787 Let's take a look.
###4788 
###4790 
###4816 MALE SPEAKER: The great thing about this next performer is
###4819 that he's next.
###4820 Oh yeah, plus, he's like a magician.
###4825 Dang.
###4826 
###4828 This is Justin Willman.
###4830 
###4834 JUSTIN WILLMAN: What is up, YouTube?
###4837 Ladies and gentlemen, I've shrouded myself behind a dark
###4840 curtain to build suspense.
###4841 Can I get an ooh, ahh?
###4843 AUDIENCE: Ooh, ahh.
###4845 JUSTIN WILLMAN: There's a dude in the second row with black
###4848 hair and a blue button up shit.
###4849 What's your name, dude?
###4852 Dude?
###4855 Name, loud, what is it?
###4856 JESSE: Jesse.
###4857 JUSTIN WILLMAN: Jesse.
###4858 Jesse, you're about to get magished.
###4860 Jesse, name any vegetable or fruit.
###4864 JESSE: Strawberries.
###4867 JUSTIN WILLMAN: Strawberry?
###4868 JESSE: Yep.
###4869 JUSTIN WILLMAN: Shit.
###4870 
###4873 Hello, what's up, YouTube?
###4877 How's it going?
###4880 This side, what's up, this side?
###4882 This side?
###4884 
###4887 Give it up for Jesse, everybody.
###4888 
###4891 One day, that's going to kill, though.
###4893 Can you imagine?
###4894 Dude says banana?
###4895 That could have been tonight.
###4896 But Jesse is here.
###4898 Anyway, my name is Justin Willman.
###4901 I am a magician.
###4902 This is great to be doing a show in Los Angeles.
###4904 Los Angeles crowd, we're feeling good?
###4906 
###4910 Normally, I have to travel.
###4913 And you can imagine, being a magician going through airport
###4914 security, it is complicated, with like
###4917 banana suits and shit.
###4918 So I actually have a couple handy tricks to speed up the
###4922 TSA process.
###4923 I take all my metal objects, like my phone and my
###4928 watch and my ring.
###4933 And instead of having them on me when I go through security
###4935 and setting off the metal detector, what I do is I put
###4938 them in a TSA friendly envelope.
###4940 
###4944 We pop the watch in there, and the ring in there.
###4950 Perfect.
###4951 And the phone, you want to be careful not
###4952 to scratch the screen.
###4954 Now Jesse, do you travel much?
###4955 JESSE: Yeah.
###4956 JUSTIN WILLMAN: You do.
###4957 Awesome.
###4958 TSA, they don't have a sense of humor.
###4960 So when you write not guns, they assume it's guns.
###4962 And they take whatever you just gave
###4963 them, and destroy it.
###4967 
###4972 It's cool, though, because I always still have my ring.
###4975 And I always still have my watch.
###4977 And I always still have my phone.
###4979 That's how I travel, people.
###4980 That's how I travel.
###4981 
###4987 Magnets.
###4989 Magnets.
###4991 
###4993 Pete Holmes, he's right.
###4994 Being a magician in 2013 is hard.
###4997 Like, when I was 14, I used to do shows at
###4999 kids' birthday parties.
###4999 It was adorable, OK.
###5001 And I would close the show by pulling a rabbit out of a hat.
###5004 People didn't care how the trick worked.
###5005 They weren't trying to bust me.
###5006 They were just happy there was a rabbit there.
###5008 They wanted to pet it.
###5009 It's cute.
###5010 But if I did that now, I'd pull the rabbit out of a hat
###5012 right here on this stage, you guys would be like, psh, it's
###5014 up his sleeve.
###5015 There's a trap door.
###5015 How was the bunny treated?
###5017 
###5020 And I think that audiences, you guys, have been
###5022 desensitized partly because of the iPhone.
###5024 This is a magical device that's in our
###5025 pockets at all times.
###5026 It does miracles.
###5027 We take it for granted.
###5028 Like, I could hold this thing up to a speaker,
###5030 it'll tell me the song.
###5031 That's magic.
###5032 10 years ago, I could've closed with that.
###5033 That would've been awesome.
###5035 I can say, take me to the YouTube show.
###5037 Using satellites, it'll take me here.
###5038 Sometimes, it'll make a phone call.
###5040 It's an amazing device.
###5042 So what I'd love to do is this.
###5043 This is kind of improvised.
###5044 But I'm going to see if Siri, my lovely assistant, can teach
###5047 us a magic trick.
###5048 We're going to merge the classic art of magic in the
###5050 new world of technology.
###5051 And if you're with me, give me a hell yes.
###5052 AUDIENCE: Hell yes.
###5054 JUSTIN WILLMAN: OK.
###5054 I'm going to patch in my Bluetooth to the
###5057 sound system here.
###5059 All right, here we ago.
###5062 Hello, Siri.
###5064 SIRI: Hello, Justin.
###5065 
###5068 JUSTIN WILLMAN: Can you teach me a magic trick?
###5072 SIRI: Did you say, teach me a magic trick?
###5076 JUSTIN WILLMAN: Yes, you're amazing.
###5077 It's amazing.
###5079 SIRI: OK.
###5080 I will help you create a magic trick using ordinary objects
###5084 in your vicinity.
###5086 JUSTIN WILLMAN: OK.
###5089 SIRI: What objects do you have nearby?
###5092 JUSTIN WILLMAN: A cloth napkin, banana, bottle of--
###5097 SIRI: Perfect.
###5099 We'll use the cloth napkin and the bandana.
###5102 
###5106 JUSTIN WILLMAN: Cloth napkin and a banana.
###5108 Banana.
###5110 SIRI: Correct.
###5112 The bandana.
###5114 JUSTIN WILLMAN: Banana.
###5115 SIRI: Pick up the bandana.
###5116 
###5119 Now fold the bandana in half.
###5123 
###5126 JUSTIN WILLMAN: Banana.
###5127 SIRI: Trust me, Justin.
###5128 Fold it in half.
###5129 
###5135 Now fold it one more time.
###5138 
###5144 Take the folded bandana and hide it in your left hand.
###5147 
###5150 Remember to keep your hand held in a natural position.
###5153 
###5156 This is called palming.
###5159 Now that you have mastered palming, we
###5162 are ready to begin.
###5164 Open up the folded bandana.
###5166 
###5168 Show the audience it's a regular bandana by waving it
###5173 up and down.
###5174 
###5177 If an audience member does not believe it is a real bandana,
###5181 allow him to wipe his face on it.
###5185 JUSTIN WILLMAN: Jesse?
###5186 You good?
###5188 SIRI: Pick up the cloth napkin and gather the corners
###5191 together, forming a makeshift bag.
###5194 
###5199 Using your free hand, fold the bandana along the creases you
###5203 made earlier.
###5205 And drop it into the makeshift bag.
###5208 
###5212 From the outside of the napkin, squeeze the bandana
###5216 into a small little ball.
###5217 
###5221 What the audience didn't see is that you never really put
###5226 the bandana into the napkin at all.
###5230 You really kept it in your left hand.
###5235 Remember palming?
###5237 JUSTIN WILLMAN: No.
###5239 SIRI: Now, make a magical gesture.
###5241 
###5249 For the big finale, fling open the napkin and receive your
###5253 well-deserved applause.
###5254 
###5261 JUSTIN WILLMAN: I'm Justin Willman.
###5262 Thank you guys so much.
###5263 Good night.
###5265 
###5268 MALE SPEAKER: Ladies and gentlemen.
###5269 
###5290 Ladies and gentlemen, a very funny man named Jeffrey Ross.
###5295 
###5309 JEFFREY ROSS: How about a hand for the Availables?
###5311 
###5314 What's up?
###5315 How you doing, YouTubers?
###5316 
###5320 It's Comedy Week, W-E-A-K, am I right?
###5325 Yeah.
###5326 I want to try something a little bit different.
###5328 I want to try speed roasting YouTube fans, volunteers from
###5332 the audience.
###5333 There's a stairwell right here.
###5335 Anybody who wants to come up, this is your chance.
###5338 I'll take as many people.
###5340 Just come on up right now.
###5341 Let's go, babe.
###5342 Come on.
###5344 Whoa, that might be too many.
###5345 Hold on.
###5347 The first, like, six.
###5349 Just fuck it, come up, let's go.
###5351 OK, that's good.
###5353 OK, I think we got enough.
###5354 That's good, that's good, that's good.
###5356 You have to come up.
###5357 But forget you guys.
###5358 No, it's too many.
###5359 It's too many.
###5359 It's OK.
###5361 All right, look at this.
###5362 Give it up for my volunteers.
###5364 Move down this way.
###5365 
###5370 Look at this outfit.
###5371 Did you make this yourself?
###5373 NICOLE: Yes.
###5375 JEFFREY ROSS: What's your name?
###5376 NICOLE: Nicole.
###5376 JEFFREY ROSS: Nicole?
###5377 I'm already fucking bored with you.
###5379 Let's go with you.
###5379 Is this your friend right here?
###5381 FEMALE SPEAKER: Nope.
###5381 JEFFREY ROSS: No?
###5382 Look at you.
###5383 Stand up, you two.
###5384 Look at that.
###5385 Two fives make a 10.
###5388 Speed roasting.
###5390 Come on, deal with it.
###5393 Look at you.
###5394 What's your name?
###5395 MELISSA: Melissa.
###5395 JEFFREY ROSS: Melissa, you're almost fuckable.
###5399 Oh my God, look at that.
###5401 Your balls are hanging down your skirt.
###5402 
###5405 How you doing, sir?
###5406 MALE SPEAKER: Good.
###5407 JEFFREY ROSS: Look at you.
###5408 Steroids make you look retarded, holy shit.
###5411 I never use the word retarded, but it just seemed to fit with
###5413 you for some reason.
###5416 Nice shirt.
###5416 What, do you keep it in your glove compartment?
###5418 Iron it once in a while.
###5420 How you doing, babe?
###5421 FEMALE SPEAKER: Good, how are you?
###5421 JEFFREY ROSS: What's going on with you?
###5423 FEMALE SPEAKER: Not much.
###5424 JEFFREY ROSS: Who you here with?
###5425 FEMALE SPEAKER: You.
###5426 JEFFREY ROSS: Oh my God.
###5427 Look at you.
###5429 Wow.
###5429 I wouldn't fuck you with his dick.
###5431 
###5434 How you doing, sir?
###5435 What's going on?
###5436 Come over here.
###5437 Look at this.
###5437 Harry Potter's blonde something.
###5442 Don't you tuck your shirt in or something?
###5444 I don't know why.
###5445 I just want to beat you up for some reason.
###5449 It's probably everything.
###5450 Look at you.
###5452 How you doing, babe?
###5454 Look at you, oh my God.
###5456 You're like a little red headed Snooki.
###5457 
###5460 You're like Cookie.
###5462 And who's this right here?
###5464 MCKENNA: I'm McKenna.
###5464 JEFFREY ROSS: McKenna?
###5464 MCKENNA: Yes.
###5465 JEFFREY ROSS: What's your story?
###5467 MCKENNA: I'm sitting there, and I'm here, and stuff.
###5469 I don't know.
###5471 JEFFREY ROSS: What do you do all day?
###5473 MCKENNA: I don't know.
###5475 Shit.
###5476 JEFFREY ROSS: Shit?
###5478 Have you seen the two girls, one cup videos?
###5480 
###5484 Wow.
###5484 I have a video coming out.
###5485 It's called one guy, no cup.
###5488 I just jerk off for two minutes.
###5490 How you doing, sir?
###5492 I loved you as the guard in Schindler's List.
###5493 
###5497 And who's this, your gardener?
###5498 
###5501 Step up here, sir, how you doing?
###5503 What's your story, illegal immigrant?
###5507 MALE SPEAKER: Work for Microsoft, that's about it.
###5510 JEFFREY ROSS: Microsoft?
###5511 You're making people's dicks microsoft right now.
###5516 What do you do for Microsoft?
###5518 MALE SPEAKER: Play video games.
###5519 JEFFREY ROSS: Play video games?
###5521 That's your job?
###5523 You're the fucking coolest guy in this fucking place, man.
###5527 And who's this lady wearing a piano doily?
###5529 How you doing?
###5531 Does your grandma know you stole the doily
###5533 off the grand piano?
###5535 You're very cute in, like, a horror movie.
###5539 
###5543 Here, come over here, sir.
###5544 This guy I know.
###5545 Is this Harley?
###5546 Good to see you.
###5547 Harley from Epic Meal Time, oh my God.
###5551 Hold on a second, Harley.
###5552 And who's this, your sister?
###5555 How you doing, sir?
###5556 Sir, ma'am, I'm not really sure what it is.
###5560 Are you OK?
###5560 I love you on the cover of Mad magazine.
###5563 MAX: Thank you.
###5565 JEFFREY ROSS: What's your name, Andy Milonakis?
###5568 MAX: It's Max.
###5569 JEFFREY ROSS: Max?
###5569 All right, take it easy, Max.
###5571 You have the biggest boobs on this stage right now, do you
###5574 realize that?
###5575 Dude, Harley, step up here for a second.
###5578 I'm such a fan of your YouTube show.
###5579 Have you guys seen Epic Meal Time?
###5582 Wow.
###5583 
###5588 How long you been doing that show?
###5589 HARLEY: Almost three years now.
###5591 JEFFREY ROSS: What video have you done that's
###5594 had the most hits?
###5596 HARLEY: We made a lasagna with about 45 hamburgers from
###5599 different fast food restaurants.
###5601 JEFFREY ROSS: How many people have watched that video?
###5604 HARLEY: Either 15 million people watched it, or three
###5606 million people watched it five times.
###5608 I don't know.
###5609 JEFFREY ROSS: Wow.
###5610 That's more hits than Rihanna took to the face.
###5614 It's fucking YouTube, relax.
###5617 That's so cool.
###5618 And you're kind of fat.
###5619 Do you eat a lot of the shit you make?
###5623 HARLEY: Well, you know, we're not so different, you and I.
###5626 Except I'm actually paid to look like a fat slob.
###5628 You're just a fat slob.
###5629 
###5634 I'm happy he's here, though.
###5636 Because now I'm not the only person that smells like cake
###5637 frosting and Arby's.
###5640 JEFFREY ROSS: I'm getting roasted by an Internet chef.
###5644 Wow.
###5645 HARLEY: I'd invite you to come cook on our show, except our
###5648 set is within 1,000 feet of a school
###5649 yard, so I don't think--
###5651 JEFFREY ROSS: Not allowed within 1,000 feet.
###5653 You got me on that one.
###5655 Thank you, Harley.
###5656 You're awesome, buddy.
###5657 How about a hand for all my YouTube
###5659 fan volunteers, everybody?
###5661 Good sports.
###5662 Thank you.
###5664 Thank you.
###5665 All right, thank you everybody.
###5666 I love you.
###5668 
###5670 
###5706 MALE SPEAKER: Ladies and gentlemen, Tim and Eric.
###5709 
###5715 TIM: Let's hear it, everybody.
###5717 Come on now.
###5718 We like lobster.
###5719 ERIC: This is great.
###5720 TIM: How many people out there are big Red Lobster fans, huh?
###5726 How many people just can't get enough Red Lobster?
###5730 Can you cut the music now, please?
###5734 We're done with the Red Lobster bit.
###5735 ERIC: Cut the fucking music.
###5736 TIM: Cut the music.
###5737 Stop the music.
###5738 ERIC: Cut it.
###5740 TIM: Stop the music.
###5742 ERIC: Cut it.
###5743 TIM: Come on, stop the fucking music.
###5745 ERIC: Shit show.
###5745 TIM: Turn the fucking-- turn the music off.
###5749 Well, thank you guys so much.
###5750 So happy to be here, part of Comedy Week.
###5752 What a great night it's been.
###5753 How much fun has this been, huh?
###5756 ERIC: It's totally awesome.
###5757 TIM: Thanks, guys.
###5759 Now, I bet a lot of you guys are wondering, what the hell?
###5764 Why are you guys so red?
###5765 Why are you holding lobsters?
###5766 Well, as you guys probably know, this week we celebrate
###5769 100 years of Red Lobster.
###5771 It's been 100 years.
###5773 100 years.
###5774 ERIC: Tim, I cannot believe how long it's been.
###5776 And you know, growing up, every Friday, I would go to
###5779 Red Lobster with my family.
###5780 And on my birthday, my step pappa would turn to me and say
###5783 son, why don't you upgrade to the surf and turf?
###5785 TIM: Oh.
###5787 ERIC: It was awesome.
###5788 TIM: I knew this guy was a surf and turf freak.
###5791 I knew it from the moment I met him.
###5792 He loves surf and turf.
###5793 Well, Eric, you're going to be so excited to find out that
###5795 this week, Red Lobster is introducing, for the first
###5798 time ever, they're calling it the endless summer all you can
###5801 eat surf and turf.
###5802 How many people would love the sound of that?
###5804 ERIC: Holy shit!
###5807 Endless summer surf and turf, just timed
###5809 for the real summer.
###5811 Ba ha!
###5812 Just in time for summer.
###5813 Ba ha!
###5814 
###5817 TIM: I didn't realize the timing was so perfect.
###5819 ERIC: Who writes this stuff?
###5820 Ba ha!
###5821 TIM: Thank you so much.
###5823 Well, Eric, that's true.
###5824 We are very excited about this endless summer surf and turf.
###5827 ERIC: We really are.
###5828 You know, the good folks over at Red Lobster are going to
###5831 blow the roof off of what you and I think turf really is.
###5834 TIM: That's right.
###5835 Because you know, we all get stuck in that paradigm where
###5836 we think that turf means steak.
###5839 I love steak, no offense to steak haters.
###5841 ERIC: Tim's a beef boy.
###5843 Ba ha!
###5844 
###5847 Ba ha ha!
###5848 TIM: If you're going to go off teleprompter, let me know.
###5851 ERIC: Ba ha ha!
###5852 
###5855 TIM: No, but it's true, though.
###5857 They're going to stop the way you think about what turf is.
###5860 ERIC: Absolutely.
###5861 TIM: For example, if you don't want
###5862 steak, you can get chicken.
###5863 Or you could get pork.
###5864 Hell, you can even get Chinese food.
###5867 ERIC: Hold on, Tim.
###5868 What if I'm in the mood for some succulent lob, but I also
###5871 want some Italian pizza pie?
###5873 TIM: Well, it's whatever your heart desires, my old friend.
###5875 ERIC: Oh my God.
###5876 Tim, my desire right now is to have an intimate table for two
###5879 with some of this endless summer surf and turf by Red
###5882 Lobster right now.
###5883 TIM: Well, Eric, you're my friend, my partner in life.
###5886 And I want to ask you to do yourself a little favor.
###5888 Why don't you close your eyes and make a wish.
###5891 ERIC: Please, put me on the endless summer surf and turf.
###5894 Please, please.
###5895 TIM: Eric, you might want to take a look.
###5897 ERIC: Oh, this is great.
###5899 Let's eat.
###5900 
###5902 Thank you, Tim.
###5903 This is fantastic.
###5905 TIM: By the way, guys, we've got a very special treat for
###5907 you guys, too.
###5909 Hit the music.
###5910 MALE SPEAKER: Ladies and gentlemen, from the Black Eyed
###5912 Peas, it's Fergie.
###5913 
###5929 FEMALE SPEAKER: [SINGING]
###5930 We were at a mall.
###5931 Me and my friends were very hungry.
###5935 One wanted meat.
###5937 The other one wanted lobster.
###5940 
###5945 Red Lobster.
###5946 
###5950 Red Lobster.
###5952 
###5966 Red Lobster, Red Lobster.
###5971 
###5976 Red Lobster, Red Lobster, Red Lobster, Red Lobster.
###5987 
###5989 [APPLAUSE]
###5992 TIM: Thank you, guys.
###5994 Big round for Fergie, huh?
###5996 
###5999 Thank you guys so much.
###6001 ERIC: Thank you from Red Lobster.
###6001 TIM: And anybody can help themselves to our leftovers.
###6004 Good night, everybody.
###6008 MALE SPEAKER: I like the way they work it, no diggity.
###6011 I'd like to bag it up, bag it up, boy.
###6014 I like the way you work it, no diggity.
###6017 Like to bag it up, bag it up now.
###6020 
###6025 MALE SPEAKER: Should I go now?
###6026 
###6030 Oh, sorry.
###6032 Ladies and gentlemen, Dax Flame.
###6034 
###6042 DAX FLAME: This is a quick one that I wrote
###6044 about homeless people.
###6045 
###6048 I gave a $10 bill to a homeless woman in San
###6050 Francisco once.
###6052 It was my first day there, and she had followed me from my
###6054 hostel and told me all this stuff about how she was
###6056 pregnant, and how she also currently had breast cancer
###6059 and AIDS and a sick husband.
###6061 I didn't know if she was lying or if she was just a
###6064 hypochondriac.
###6065 But I gave her the money just to be kind.
###6067 Another time, on that same San Francisco trip though, I
###6070 bought a drink from a convenience store for $3.99.
###6073 And the cashier gave me a penny back.
###6075 And as I walked out the door of the store, a homeless man
###6078 saw that I had change.
###6079 And he said, ooh, for me?
###6081 I smiled politely and began to hand him the penny.
###6084 As I put it in his hand, his expression changed.
###6087 And he yelled at me, oh, an effing penny?
###6089 Get the eff out of here, man.
###6091 And I speed walked away as fast as I could.
###6093 Because I didn't know if he had a shiv or something.
###6095 He'd asked for the penny, and then yelled at me.
###6097 It was because I had unintentionally
###6098 gotten his hopes up.
###6100 And he was expecting more than one lousy penny.
###6102 But what should I have done?
###6103 Just ignored him?
###6105 It's hard to know how to navigate those kind of
###6106 situations.
###6108 Another time, a hobo asked me for some money while I was
###6110 eating in the outdoor area of a cafe.
###6112 And I offered him the cheese off my sandwich, because I
###6114 wasn't going to eat it anyways.
###6115 And I just thought I'd ask, since he
###6117 told me he was hungry.
###6118 And he just gave me a look like he wanted to
###6120 watch me die in a fire.
###6122 There was only ever one time when a hobo tried to punch me.
###6124 Me and my parents were just walking by.
###6126 And he was sitting there holding a cup of change out.
###6129 I stopped, looked at him, and he kind of smiled at me.
###6132 So I reached my hand into the cup.
###6133 When he saw that I was about to pull a fist full of change
###6136 out, he swatted my hand away and tried to hit my face.
###6139 But I dodged his fist.
###6141 I was only 10 when that happened, and not familiar
###6143 with the habits of homeless people yet.
###6145 So that's why I didn't realize he was
###6147 begging, and not offering.
###6149 
###6155 MALE SPEAKER: One time I was sad, and then I
###6158 watched these guys.
###6159 
###6162 It's the Key of Awesome.
###6164 
###6170 THE KEY OF AWESOME: Grab every single one of your friends and
###6174 start a Mumford band.
###6177 Take a Mumford stand.
###6179 
###6181 You don't need a drummer in a Mumford band.
###6185 You just stomp your feet and you clap your hands.
###6193 Oh, pack your bag, we're going to Mumford land.
###6203 We got our own spoon man.
###6205 
###6209 Excuse me, sir, I'd like to know, where is
###6211 this Mumford land?
###6212 It's somewhere between Limerick and
###6214 Williamsburg, Brookland.
###6216 So pull up your suspenders, chug another jug of wine.
###6219 Tonight we're going to party like it's 1899.
###6223 We strum on our guitars so hard we break
###6226 our strummin' hands.
###6227 We use a toaster filter when we post on Instagram.
###6230 We used to be the house band for the "Antiques Road Show."
###6234 Someone sound the trumpets, now let's do
###6236 some heys and ho's.
###6237 Ho's and heys, heys and ho's.
###6242 Three cheers for the Lumineers.
###6244 They're a Mumford band.
###6247 And Phillip Phillips.
###6248 He's a Mumford man.
###6250 Well, he's more of a Mumford kid.
###6253 We saw "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" And said let's start a
###6259 band right now.
###6260 Our clothing and our songs are hand me downs.
###6265 Spoon solo!
###6268 The way we play is pure and honest, bordering
###6272 on weird and Amish.
###6275 Technology is what we abolish in Mumford land, except for
###6280 our iPhones.
###6282 Because we're a Mumford band, the oldest latest fad.
###6288 And Johnny Depp's a fan.
###6290 Laddie plays the washboard, Wendel
###6292 plays the fipple flutes.
###6294 Bare knuckle boxing's how they settle band disputes.
###6297 Emmett plays the juice harp, and Neil
###6299 plays his own mustache.
###6301 Thaddeus the bar keep makes us cocktails in a flask.
###6304 Joe scratches the Victrola like an old timey DJ.
###6308 Jill's on social media, she Twitters from the stage.
###6312 We got too many members.
###6313 Now the stage is caving in.
###6316 Can't tell where the audience ends and
###6318 where the band begins.
###6319 Come on everyone, clap your hands.
###6322 Start a Mumford band, the oldest latest fad.
###6329 Start a Mumford band, the oldest latest fad.
###6334 
###6337 Hey ho!
###6339 Thank you very much.
###6340 
###6351 RHETT: YouTube is home to a lot of challenge videos.
###6354 LINK: These are videos of people testing the limits of
###6355 physical and emotional embarrassment.
###6357 RHETT: And we've combined all these challenges together to
###6359 the Ultimate YouTube Challenge Challenge.
###6361 LINK: We've got a bunch of YouTubers.
###6362 We got some milk, make up, tin cans,
###6364 marshmallows, you get the idea.
###6366 RHETT: You guys ready?
###6367 
###6373 All right, we're going to get started with
###6374 the cinnamon challenge.
###6375 But a doctor said you can die if you do that.
###6377 So we're going to do the safe cinnamon challenge.
###6379 That means, put the cinnamon in your mouth and
###6381 just spit it out.
###6381 The YouTube Challenge Challenge starts in 3, 2, 1.
###6386 
###6391 All right, now the Bunny Make Up Challenge.
###6394 For the next 10 seconds, put as many marshmallows into your
###6397 mouth as you can grab.
###6400 All right, now apply the make up in front of you on your
###6404 face without the use of a mirror.
###6405 
###6409 You have your 20 second supernote, go.
###6412 
###6421 And now we're moving on to the baby food challenge.
###6423 Put your bib on.
###6425 Put the bib on.
###6426 
###6429 Now on the count of three, tell us what you think it is.
###6434 3, 2, 1.

###6528 Hey, we're Rhett and Link, creators of Nope, Chuck Testa,
###6532 the ship that shipped a commercial, and the YouTube
###6534 Challenge Challenge that you just watched.
###6535 
###6540 Why'd you do that?
###6542 LINK: Well, that was a spit take, Rhett.
###6543 And YouTube is issuing a new challenge,
###6545 the spit take challenge.
###6546 So I'm raising awareness for it.
###6548 RHETT: Yeah, but usually a spit take is like a response
###6550 to something funny.
###6551 I haven't said any--
###6554 anything funny.
###6555 OK, I see how this is going.
###6557 OK.
###6558 You can accept the YouTube spit take challenge by
###6560 uploading your creative version of a spit take.
###6563 I know you're about to do it again.
###6565 LINK: No, that one didn't do anything for me.
###6569 RHETT: So make your own spit take video.
###6570 Get creative with the liquids, get creative with the setting.
###6573 And then make sure you upload it with the title YouTube spit
###6576 take challenge.
###6577 
###6585 2%?
###6586 
###6588 2%?
###6589 LINK: Nope, whole, guaranteed organic.
###6592 RHETT: OK, all right, good.
###6594 LINK: Listen, make sure you don't have any liquid in your
###6595 mouth for this next guy, or you will ruin your screen.
###6598 RHETT: Give it up for our final performer of the night,
###6600 Hannibal Buress.
###6601 
###6609 HANNIBAL BURESS: Yeah, yeah, yes.
###6614 Yes.
###6615 Look at my suit.
###6616 
###6619 I've been doing comedy for a few years.
###6621 And one of my first big gigs, I'm opening for Tracy Morgan
###6626 at this theater in Chicago.
###6627 Before the show started, I went to his dressing room and
###6629 said, hey man.
###6631 How much time do you want me to do before you go on?
###6635 That's a simple question for the
###6636 opener to ask the headliner.
###6637 But he's such a weirdo.
###6638 Hey, just do a little time.
###6641 You'll be like the date rape drug, and I'll be like the big
###6644 black dick.
###6647 Yo, how much time is that, man?
###6650 Is that 15 minutes?
###6652 All right, I'll just do 15.
###6653 That's such a weird way to think about time, man.
###6655 
###6658 I drink.
###6659 That's my vice of choice is drinking.
###6661 I don't smoke weed.
###6663 Because I get weird when I smoke weed.
###6665 When I drink, I'm able to be in the moment.
###6667 When I smoke weed, I overanalyze the moment, which
###6671 is not good to do while you're having sex.
###6673 Because if I'm drunk and having sex, I'm thinking yeah,
###6674 this is cool.
###6675 But if I'm high and I'm having sex, I'm thinking yo, why is
###6678 she letting me do this to her?
###6682 What was her childhood like?
###6684 What's her relationship with her father?
###6686 Does she let everybody smash this quick?
###6688 I start doing weird stuff, doing high sex, like counting
###6691 my strokes.
###6692 And one, two, three and a four, is she satisfied, five.
###6696 
###6700 I tried cocaine in college.
###6701 It was too intense.
###6704 I went to this party coked up.
###6705 As soon as we got there, this girl threw a beer in my
###6707 friend's face.
###6708 I freaked out.
###6709 Fucking slap that bitch, man.
###6711 She threw a beer on you, now you slap her.
###6713 He said Hannibal, relax.
###6714 If I slap her, those five dudes over there
###6716 going to kick my ass.
###6717 Yo, you just slap her.
###6720 I'll worry about the rest.
###6722 And I never want to feel like that again.
###6724 There's no reason for me to be telling a dude to slap a woman
###6727 and think I can beat up five people.
###6728 That's not a necessary sensation.
###6730 And I don't need it in my life at all.
###6732 I probably couldn't beat up five children.
###6735 One of them kick me in the balls, I fall over.
###6737 They stomp on me.
###6737 It's a done deal.
###6740 But I'd be lying if I said that cocaine hasn't brought
###6743 some beautiful moments into my life.
###6746 When I was in Minneapolis, I had a threesome with these
###6748 girls that were on cocaine.
###6750 I didn't think a threesome was going to happen.
###6751 Because I thought the fat one would leave.
###6753 But when life gives you lemons, you
###6755 throw lemons at people.
###6757 I didn't want her to leave because she was fat.
###6759 She just didn't seem that into the whole situation at first.
###6761 But once the cocaine got into her, turns out,
###6764 she was really cool.
###6767 I didn't do any cocaine with them.
###6769 Because it can soften up your dick.
###6770 And the last thing I need in my hotel room is two angry,
###6773 coked out, horny girls yelling at me, Hannibal,
###6775 what's wrong with it?
###6776 I don't know.
###6777 Can everybody just be quiet?
###6778 
###6780 And then we had a good old fashioned Midwestern night.
###6782 It was beautiful.
###6784 I wake up, the hotel room was kind of trashed.
###6786 So I leave a nice tip for housekeeping.
###6787 I go off to do morning radio.
###6789 I come back.
###6790 The room is cleaned perfectly.
###6792 They cleaned all around the room.
###6794 They cleaned on the kitchen counter.
###6795 Except they left a small bump of cocaine.
###6798 And I say, that's extremely professional hotel
###6800 housekeeping right there.
###6802 They love people.
###6803 And that's the type of attention to detail that gets
###6805 you a five star Yelp review right there.
###6809 I'll be back to that Residence Inn, Marriott.
###6812 Three star hotel, five star service.
###6814 
###6816 I was in Vegas for Fourth of July.
###6819 I see a billboard, comedian Eddie Griffin
###6821 had a show in Vegas.
###6822 I said, oh man, that'd be great.
###6824 That's one of the veterans.
###6824 That'd be awesome to see him live.
###6826 But I go online to see how much tickets were.
###6827 Tickets were $70.
###6829 I said shit, I don't like Eddie Griffin that much.
###6831 That's a lot of money for a comedy show, $70.
###6834 Because I don't want that pressure over my head when I'm
###6836 watching the show.
###6836 Because I'll be thinking, yeah, he funny.
###6838 But he ain't $70 funny.
###6840 He good, I don't know about $70 good.
###6842 But I still want to finagle a way in.
###6844 So I figured out a plan.
###6845 I'ma call the box office, act like I'm my own agent, trying
###6848 to get tickets like that.
###6850 I call the box office.
###6850 Hello.
###6851 Who handles VIP complimentary tickets?
###6853 I want to get some tickets for my client to see
###6855 Eddie Griffin tonight.
###6856 And he said, what's your name?
###6858 And I hadn't thought of a fake agent name yet.
###6861 They kind of put me on the spot.
###6862 So reflexively I said, Hannibal Buress.
###6866 I'm thinking, I just messed up my hopes.
###6867 Dammit.
###6868 Because they don't know me.
###6869 And I can't say I'm Hannibal Buress
###6870 represented by Hannibal Buress.
###6871 That sounds dumb.
###6873 They said, well, who is your client?
###6874 I had to think quick.
###6875 I said, Donald Glover.
###6878 And I hang up the phone.
###6880 Now, I'm thinking that they sensed the
###6881 bullshit in my voice.
###6882 Nothing's going to happen.
###6884 Five minutes later they call back and say, how
###6885 many tickets you need?
###6887 I said, I need four tickets.
###6890 And then we went and watched the show.
###6894 It was a good show.
###6896 It wasn't $70 good.
###6897 But it was a good show.
###6899 So now the show's over.
###6900 We're finishing our drinks.
###6901 And one of Eddie Griffin's lackeys comes up to our table
###6903 and says, hey, you said that Donald Glover was on TV shows
###6907 with Eddie Griffin.
###6908 Eddie don't know Donald, and Donald's not even here.
###6910 I said, first of all, you are adding stuff to
###6911 my lie right now.
###6913 I never said they worked together.
###6914 I merely dropped the name and the person at the box office
###6917 fell for it.
###6917 Second of all, the show is over.
###6919 I don't know what you want from me right now.
###6921 I can't vomit the comedy out of my body back to you.
###6924 It's done, man.
###6925 We experienced that shit already.
###6927 You've been had.
###6928 It was a hoax.
###6929 I'm Hannibal Buress
###6930 represented by Hannibal Buress.
###6933 Tell Eddie I said great show.
###6934 I'm looking for new clients.
###6937 Thanks a lot, YouTube, and this crowd.
###6939 
###6943 Before I leave, I don't know if y'all know.
###6946 I got the top single in Norway right now, the top
###6949 rap single in Norway.
###6949 It's called Gibberish Rap.
