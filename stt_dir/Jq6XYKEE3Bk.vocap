###0 [DOG BARKING]
###0 ANTHONY PAPPALARDO: Stray!
###1 [SNAPS FINGERS]
###2 MALE SPEAKER: Sorry.
###4 ANTHONY PAPPALARDO: Stray.
###5 
###9 MALE SPEAKER: Wait.
###10 What's your dog's name?
###11 ANTHONY PAPPALARDO: Stray.
###13 Stray.
###14 Like a lost dog.
###16 MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, yeah.
###18 You got it at a shelter, or something?
###20 ANTHONY PAPPALARDO: Yeah, up in Harland.
###21 They just found her roaming the streets.
###24 And just the typical dog story you've heard a million times
###28 of just falling in love with the dog in the fucking cage.
###32 So it was cool.
###33 I couldn't understand paying some asshole $600 for a pure
###36 bred dog when there's so many that could just be fucking
###43 helped or saved, or something.
###46 So, it worked out.
###47 It worked out.
###48 She just hangs out in here, man.
###50 Little Stray.
###51 TED BARROW: Yeah, it was a rescue dog.
###53 It was really nervous.
###53 Like, the only person it would respond to was Pappalardo.
###57 Like, everyone else it would bark or hide under the table.
###60 If you could find a dog that reflects one aspect of his
###64 personality, he's loyal to his friends, he's loyal to his
###67 family, he's a genuinely nice person.
###71 He's not fake.
###74 
###79 PATRICK O'DELL: Welcome back to show.
###81 This episode was about Anthony Pappalardo.
###84 Now, I didn't think that would ever happen.
###86 I mean, people write in and they request who they want a
###89 show on, and people say Anthony a lot, and I always,
###92 like, psht, like that'll happen.
###95 And when I filmed the Lakai explosion day, I was like
###99 afraid to even point the camera at him, because I don't
###102 know, I thought he'd get mad, or be like, What's this corny
###104 show you do, or whatever.
###106 But for whatever reason he wrote me back when I emailed
###110 him, and he said, Yeah I'll do an episode.
###112 Come over.
###113 And maybe he didn't even think it was going to
###114 be like a full episode.
###115 I think I kind of pitched it like, I'm just going to ask
###118 you about Guy Mariano really fast.
###120 And then I kept prodding, and I was like, What about Mosaic?
###124 Anthony's done a lot in his career.
###128 He's like a real skater's skater.
###131 He's one of those people that when you see a photo or you
###133 see a video clip, it just stands out.
###135 
###148 I don't know.
###148 I'm excited to have Anthony on the show.
###150 And this may be the first time he's ever been on a show.
###153 Here it is.
###153 A full blown Anthony Pappalardo episode.
###156 I'm as shocked as you are.
###158 Welcome to the show.
###160 
###163 ANTHONY PAPPALARDO: I'm not that interesting of a dude,
###165 but it's the fact of because I don't really do this stuff.
###168 But that's the thing with pro skaters.
###170 A lot of them like to be in front of this, and do this
###173 whole side of it.
###175 When you try to keep it personal to a certain level,
###178 and you don't want to put yourself really out there,
###182 that doesn't really give people what they want.
###187 Automatically it turns into a falseness that they have to
###190 create, because there's nothing out there for them to
###195 kind of pick apart at.
###197 You know, I'll put out a video every two, three years.
###202 I hope you like it.
###202 If you do, you do.
###203 If you don't, you don't.
###204 And I think that's maybe how I was taught.
###209 When I was young and I used to look up to Mike or Rick or,
###213 like, Fred Gall, I didn't know one
###216 personal thing about Freddie.
###217 You know what I mean?
###218 I think that's how it should be.
###220 
###225 I don't think I ever thought or wanted to be like, all
###229 right this is it, I want to be a pro skater.
###232 I think that's an east coast thing.
###233 I think I just kind of fell into it, more or less.
###239 There you are.
###241 MALE SPEAKER: Here are your boards.
###243 ANTHONY PAPPALARDO: Yeah, I got two boards that I feel are
###245 kind of fitting for a kitchen, maybe.
###247 MALE SPEAKER: Oh wait.
###248 Don't you have pizza in your family?
###250 ANTHONY PAPPALARDO: Yeah, my dad owns a pizza store.
###254 So that's hat.
###256 MALE SPEAKER: You and the Fully Flared poster.
###258 ANTHONY PAPPALARDO: Oh yeah, my mom took that photo.
###261 I don't know.
###261 It was my first actual skate premiere I ever went to.
###264 I went to like an Alien one in Ohio for Mosaic that was kind
###268 of like a half-assed one.
###269 But this was, I guess, my first pretty big one.
###272 Just kind of hung out with them in
###273 kind of a little disguise.
###275 I didn't really get noticed too much, which was a good
###278 thing, I think.
###279 You know, I think I lucked out, because I didn't know
###281 anything really about the video, so I wasn't expecting
###285 my part to be second, or something.
###288 Like I had no idea what order or anything.
###291 So by the time my part was on it was pretty much done.
###295 MALE SPEAKER: Well, I remember watching right after Fully
###297 Flared some indie video on the internet, and I was like, Oh
###300 yeah, like, you know what I mean?
###301 There's still this.
###302 There's still so much to skating.
###304 ANTHONY PAPPALARDO: So much, man.
###305 And to put out a video to say that it would, like, be the
###309 end and all of skating, you'd have to be a pretty unoriginal
###312 person to think that.
###314 You know what I mean?
###315 You'd have to be like--
###318 fuck, I would hate to, you know--
###321 And there was like when [INAUDIBLE] did that video,
###323 Manic [INAUDIBLE].
###324 Like people were like, Oh my God.
###327 Like a month later that video sucked.
###331 Obviously the idea that they were doing the Lakai video,
###333 and they started getting pretty serious and they were
###335 doing trips and stuff.
###337 These guys were going to have parts, like Guy Mariano, or
###340 like Mark, and all these guys, and Carroll, and I just felt
###347 like I just couldn't really--
###348 I don't know.
###348 So I just came up with the idea of just trying to stay
###354 home and film around New York.
###357 If you watch the video from the beginning to the and, like
###361 my part, I just wanted it to look different
###363 than everyone else's.
###364 Not better, not worse.
###366 Just kind of different.
###368 I wasn't trying to change skateboarding with my part.
###372 I did a lot of basic stuff in my part, like Smith grinds,
###376 and grinds, and ollies, and stuff.
###377 But I just want to make a part where I'll watch it and be
###383 kind of psyched on it in 10 years or something.
###386 I think skating's so fucked, is like, how good everyone is.
###390 Like, why not do something like that.
###393 It's just like everyone's good at skateboarding now.
###395 And it's just hard to break apart from that.
###399 TY EVANS: You know what's funny, is like Paps, the whole
###402 time we were making this video he told me, Hey, I kind of got
###407 this idea I'm going for.
###409 And it's going to be just raw New York
###411 vibe skating at night.
###413 Like early hocus pocus.
###414 That's what he kept calling it.
###415 BILL STROBECK: I feel like the video is so gung ho, and
###418 everyone was so fucking, like, Whoa, we've got to get this
###420 thing, we've go to do this.
###422 I feel like we just did the complete opposite.
###425 I feel like it was fun, you know?
###427 Which is cool, because you do something so long, like the
###431 fun part leaves, you know?
###432 We just wanted to do it how they used to do
###434 it back in the day.
###436 In like video days.
###438 You just film what you film.
###439 It shows the time, you know what I mean?
###441 I thought he did a lot of hard shit in his part.
###443 I thought it was great.
###444 I think it's great.
###445 The only thing that I didn't think was great was that he
###447 was in Times Square in his part.
###448 I thought that was stupid.
###449 I know for a fact that he would never be in Times Square
###454 walking around.
###455 It was a little weird.
###457 ANTHONY PAPPALARDO: We'll just go skate.
###459 I'll call him up, cruise around for a couple hours, and
###461 then maybe not speak to him for a week or something.
###465 Like there's never been like, All right, well, let's meet up
###469 tomorrow to film that.
###470 I don't know.
###471 It's just always on a whim.
###473 Especially for that Lakai video.
###475 It was nothing more than having a couple of beers or
###478 something, and like, Hey, let's just go put the camera
###481 light on and go skate.
###482 And that's what it was.
###483 It was that for a couple nights, and then it was not
###486 that for a very long time.
###489 The level of some of the stuff that I had on film, a lot of
###493 people could do it, I would say.
###496 You guys are all kind of in this video.
###498 So it's like I guess has to be some level of skating that
###501 makes or breaks the cut.
###503 MALE SPEAKER: Did you have lot of stuff filmed that wasn't
###504 going to go in or didn't go in?
###507 ANTHONY PAPPALARDO: Yeah I think so.
###509 I had some other footage that wasn't in that video part.
###513 BILL STROBECK: I had all this left over footage that Ty
###516 didn't use.
###517 
###519 I didn't want it to go to waste.
###520 
###524 The beginning part was Anthony talking to this guy.
###527 Like I didn't even send that to them.
###529 Like, I knew I was going to do something with it.
###532 It was kind of like, Oh, I'm going to use this.
###534 I'm not giving this to anyone.
###536 Because I thought it was awesome.
###538 MALE SPEAKER: Want some food?
###540 I'll feed all you guys right now.
###541 Right there.
###541 BK.
###543 ANTHONY PAPPALARDO: OK, thanks for the offer.
###545 Thank you.
###546 MALE SPEAKER: Don't let the motherfucker bullshit you.
###548 Proof is in the pudding.
###549 
###552 BILL STROBECK: It's Anthony, and little Alex.
###556 Alex Olson.
###559 And this kid Goose that I grew up with.
###561 You know.
###562 It was like, I'm putting everyone in there.
###563 Fuck this, you know?
###564 It's cool.
###565 I'll tell you right now, he skates in New York a lot.
###569 New York you're just not going to get as much footage.
###573 It's different, dude.
###574 I didn't bring any equipment with me.
###576 Like, no one has a camera light.
###577 No one has a camera light.
###578 You know what I mean?
###579 It was, like, generator.
###580 You can't do generators.
###580 It's way different, man.
###583 I think Anthony's just kind of like trying to stick out.
###585 I think that's what keeps it going for him, you know?
###589 You can't keep doing the same thing or it gets boring.
###591 He just wants to keep reinventing himself.
###594 I think that's cool.
###595 
###598 MALE SPEAKER: What do you think of that?
###600 MALE SPEAKER: I said, Man, that was mad beautiful, man.
###602 That motherfucker came up and over, and then came and
###607 flipped out and came down--
###608 BILL STROBECK (OFFSCREEN): That guy's awesome.
###609 I see him all the time.
###610 That guy rules.
###611 
###616 ROB PLUHOWSKI: Hey, Laila, they want
###618 you to come out here.
###620 MALE SPEAKER: What's your name?
###621 LAILA: Laila.
###622 MALE SPEAKER: Hi Laila.
###623 Pleasure to meet you.
###624 Have you ever seen any skateboard videos that your
###627 father's in?
###629 LAILA: I don't know?
###630 ROB PLUHOWSKI: We don't let her see those.
###632 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Were you kicked off
###634 because you had a kid?
###635 ROB PLUHOWSKI: Oh, no.
###636 I wasn't going anywhere.
###638 I knew it.
###639 You know I mean?
###639 I was just in denial.
###640 You get to a point in skateboarding where it's like
###642 that's all you do is skateboard.
###644 You forget about a job.
###645 You forget that real life happens.
###646 And things go on.
###649 When Joe Castrucci called me up and kicked me off it was
###651 probably the best thing that's ever happened to me.
###653 I needed to move on.
###655 I'm not the type of person that was a career
###657 skateboarder, as you say.
###659 Maybe would say.
###661 I met Anthony in Philly.
###663 Probably I was barely 21.
###665 20, 21.
###666 If I go skateboarding tomorrow he's the one
###668 I'm going to call.
###669 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Dude, look at that.
###670 He would've done it.
###672 ROB PLUHOWSKI: See, I haven't really been, like, in the
###675 skateboard thing.
###676 Like when Lakai video came out, from what I hear, Anthony
###681 didn't meet people's expectations.
###684 People were talking shit on it, and like his
###685 part wasn't all great.
###687 But he's done like the hardest things.
###692 He just took a different path.
###694 He tried different stuff and kind of put a twist on his
###699 skateboarding.
###700 People say he's being lazy or whatnot, but Anthony can do
###702 anything he wants to do on a skateboard.
###705 He is the most determined kid on a skateboard ever I've ever
###709 personally met.
###710 One of the most determined kids on a skateboard.
###711 He can do anything he wants to do.
###716 TY EVANS: There's like that section of skaters that are,
###718 like, so into Bobby Puleo, so into Anthony Pappalardo, and
###725 Ricky Oyola, and they're so into those really raw, city
###728 street skater guys.
###729 That's just a totally raw, pure form of skating.
###732 Look at Pappalardo now compared to Pappalardo before.
###735 They're two different types of skaters.
###737 And they're both equally as rad.
###739 You want to know how fucking tech he was?
###740 He was getting into backside flips, switchfronts like
###742 Crooks on DWP when I first saw him.
###745 And I remember around that same time was Photosynthesis
###748 where he did the [INAUDIBLE]
###749 180 fakie 5.0 across the whole bench at the seaport.
###751 That's fucking gnarly.
###753 ANTHONY PAPPALARDO: There's not one professional--
###755 or it doesn't even have to be an issue of
###757 professional or not--
###759 skateboarder that hasn't changed how they've skated
###762 since they were 15 to 30.
###771 Like any skateboarder I was just so addicted to it at that
###776 age, it just consumed me.
###778 From 13 on there was a lot of skating involved, and just
###784 watching skate videos, to skating, to
###787 being in the city skating.
###788 
###792 I don't know.
###793 It's like, any skater you talk to, I think, will always have
###798 those couple of years, will agree how it really does
###802 consume everything.
###803 And you miss out on, at that time, it's like stupid shit--
###808 the high school parties, and all that stuff, college, and I
###811 don't regret a minute of it, but that doesn't even exist in
###816 your world.
###817 
###823 BRIAN WENNING: I like how all these people that don't even
###825 know him love how he is this Bob Dylan type skateboarder,
###832 where he just does what he wants, when he wants, and
###834 everybody loves him.
###837 I don't know him anymore.
###839 I know the guy that he was back then.
###842 But everybody changes.
###843 I don't know the Anthony Pappalardo of 2008 to 2009.
###847 I don't know what he's like.
###849 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): How long has it been since you and
###851 Anthony talked?
###852 BRIAN WENNING: That's when we were in competition.
###854 And I mean, I still skate the same as I [INAUDIBLE]
###857 forgot about him.
###859 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): This is like the original
###860 battleground spot for you and Anthony?
###862 BRIAN WENNING: Right here?
###863 Yeah, right here, this is where it all happened.
###866 First day we met he was trying to kick from the stairs, and I
###868 was like, No, man.
###870 Can't let this happen.
###873 And then I did it before him and then after that we hated
###875 each other, and then we became best friends.
###879 MALE SPEAKERS (OFFSCREEN): Whoaa!
###882 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Back to back.
###883 Back to back.
###885 MALE SPEAKERS (OFFSCREEN): Ohhh!
###886 
###897 ANTHONY PAPPALARDO: Yeah, we skated a bunch, man.
###900 We would just meet up in New York, downtown, and fucking
###904 jump down the bank steps all day, and just be some fucking
###910 weirdos, little suburb kids in the city getting away with it.
###915 
###918 MALE SPEAKER: You can't skate here.
###919 It's private property.
###921 get that?
###921 Understand that in your head?
###923 Private property.
###925 P-R-I-V-A-T-E.
###929 MALE SPEAKER: What are you going to do if I come back?
###930 MALE SPEAKER: Fuck you up.
###933 And you.
###933 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Me?
###934 MALE SPEAKER: Think I'm laughing?
###935 Think I'm joking?
###936 Come back here tonight.
###937 MALE SPEAKER: You can't hit him.
###938 He's 16 years old.
###938 MALE SPEAKER: I don't give a fuck if you was two.
###941 Come back here tonight and see what happens.
###943 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): All right.
###944 I'll be here.
###945 I'll be here.
###945 I'll fucking be here.
###947 MALE SPEAKER: I hope so.
###947 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): I hope so too.
###950 I'll be here tonight.
###952 All right, I'll see you tonight.
###953 I'll see you, bro.
###955 Have your boxing gloves ready.
###956 I'll be back.
###957 BILL STROBECK: I mean, when I first started film them it was
###960 for Photosynthesis.
###961 Well, the first person that I was filming was Josh Kalis,
###965 because he was just local.
###967 Then I call from Joe Castrucci a month later.
###971 He was like, Dude, you want to film?
###973 We can hook you up with some dough.
###975 I was like, Sure.
###976 I got all the numbers to everyone right away, and the
###979 first person I called was Anthony.
###981 And I was kind of nervous.
###982 It was weird, because I didn't know anyone.
###985 I mean, I knew Josh, and stuff, but I didn't know
###990 Anthony when I called him.
###991 I was like, Dude, what's up?
###994 I'm Bill.
###994 I got a job.
###996 I was like, Let's meet up.
###1001 He was, like, Dude, I'll be at the seaport at like 8:00 in
###1005 the morning.
###1006 MALE SPEAKER: (OFFSCREEN): Yeah!
###1007 BILL STROBECK: I took a Greyhound and met him up here.
###1011 It was just me and him.
###1013 And then Wenning showed up an hour later.
###1016 We filmed a line that first day.
###1017 Like right off the bat.
###1019 
###1035 MALE SPEAKER: These used to be the benches that you see in
###1037 the Photosynthesis video right here.
###1039 
###1042 Anthony slept on this one, and then I slept on this one.
###1046 And we woke up with bums going through our pockets and stuff.
###1051 Pretty much slept like a half hour, probably.
###1053 And then he got up and nollied 180 at the big rail at the
###1056 Brooklyn banks in the Alien Workshop video.
###1057 
###1076 ANTHONY PAPPALARDO: No, that was kind of wack.
###1077 I don't know about that.
###1078 
###1081 Dude, I don't know.
###1082 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Let me keep it.
###1083
