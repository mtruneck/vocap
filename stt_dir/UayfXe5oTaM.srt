You're too big.


42
0:1:36,362 --> 0:1:38,197

<i> community of friends.</i>


51
0:1:55,347 --> 0:1:58,951
<i> But behind the front doors
 of Jay's quiet cul-de-sac</i>


52
0:1:58,951 --> 0:2:2,54
<i> there's growing fear
 about the future.</i>


53
0:2:2,54 --> 0:2:4,89
Jay: We're preparing for
the breakdown of social


54
0:2:4,89 --> 0:2:9,428
order caused by an
economic collapse.


55
0:2:9,428 --> 0:2:10,829
Are they shooting
up there?


56
0:2:10,829 --> 0:2:12,665
Go!


57
0:2:12,665 --> 0:2:15,634
I believe our life is
different because we prep.


58
0:2:15,634 --> 0:2:17,57
I believe it's a
better quality of life.


59
0:2:17,57 --> 0:2:19,905
I think it was a
combination of things,


60
0:2:19,905 --> 0:2:23,576
like September 11th,
like the tsunami of 2004.


61
0:2:23,576 --> 0:2:25,611
A combination of
experiences I've had as


62
0:2:25,611 --> 0:2:28,214
law enforcement officer
lead me to believe we are


63
0:2:28,214 --> 0:2:30,449
susceptible to
certain situations


64
0:2:30,449 --> 0:2:31,951
that are out of
our control.


65
0:2:31,951 --> 0:2:33,819
I want my family
to be ready for


66
0:2:33,819 --> 0:2:35,721
those type of
situations.


67
0:2:35,721 --> 0:2:37,823
<i> Narrator: Jay believes the
 world will soon enter a</i>


68
0:2:37,823 --> 0:2:40,593
<i> global depression, causing
 unemployment worse than</i>


69
0:2:40,593 --> 0:2:42,561
<i> the Great Depression
 that could collapse</i>


70
0:2:42,561 --> 0:2:45,664
<i> civilized society
 altogether.</i>


71
0:2:45,664 --> 0:2:47,333
Jay: When people
can't get jobs and


72
0:2:47,333 --> 0:2:48,867
then can't feed
their families,


73
0:2:48,867 --> 0:2:50,135
I think those are
the types of things


74
0:2:50,135 --> 0:2:52,71
that will really
set them off.


75
0:2:52,71 --> 0:2:54,73
You see people
rioting and


76
0:2:54,73 --> 0:2:56,742
you see people basically
destroying things


77
0:2:56,742 --> 0:2:58,911
because they're not
getting their way.


78
0:2:58,911 --> 0:3:1,247
There's a very thin
fabric that holds


79
0:3:1,247 --> 0:3:3,816
together a
civilized society.


80
0:3:3,816 --> 0:3:5,784
<i> Narrator: With more
 than 5.5 million</i>


81
0:3:5,784 --> 0:3:7,853
<i> people in the
 greater D.C. area,</i>


82
0:3:7,853 --> 0:3:10,189
<i> Jay fears that urban
 unrest could spill into</i>


83
0:3:10,189 --> 0:3:14,56
<i> suburbs and overwhelm
 local police officers.</i>


84
0:3:14,56 --> 0:3:17,796
Jay: Once the mob
mentality sets in it all


85
0:3:17,796 --> 0:3:21,634
adds up to a situation
that could be very,


86
0:3:21,634 --> 0:3:24,87
very dangerous to
try to survive in.


87
0:3:24,87 --> 0:3:27,39
<i> Narrator: Jay fears
 violence and looting could</i>


88
0:3:27,39 --> 0:3:29,408
<i> potentially spill
 into his neighborhood.</i>


89
0:3:29,408 --> 0:3:31,91
<i> So he's fortified his
 4,000 square foot</i>


90
0:3:31,91 --> 0:3:33,812
<i> home with things
 he'll need to stay</i>


91
0:3:33,812 --> 0:3:37,683
<i> off the streets, like six
 months of food and water.</i>


92
0:3:37,683 --> 0:3:40,486
Jay: We believe strongly
in sheltering in place.


93
0:3:40,486 --> 0:3:42,721
You know, we have the
home field advantage here.


94
0:3:42,721 --> 0:3:44,156
We know where
our supplies are.


95
0:3:44,156 --> 0:3:45,824
We have a lot
of supplies.


96
0:3:45,824 --> 0:3:47,593
Holly: I prefer that
all of our preps


97
0:3:47,593 --> 0:3:51,96
be kept in closets,
garages and storage sheds.


98
0:3:51,96 --> 0:3:53,299
We like to maintain
some normalcy,


99
0:3:53,299 --> 0:3:55,234
even though we do
this on the side.


100
0:3:55,234 --> 0:3:56,835
<i> Narrator: As a former
 police officer,</i>


101
0:3:56,835 --> 0:3:59,271
<i> Jay's main focus
 is on security.</i>


102
0:3:59,271 --> 0:4:1,44
Jay: We keep a total
of about 7,000


103
0:4:1,44 --> 0:4:3,409
rounds of ammunition
in the bedroom.


104
0:4:3,409 --> 0:4:6,512
Holly: Ok, so I guess
we have a samurai sword


105
0:4:6,512 --> 0:4:7,479
in this closet.


106
0:4:7,479 --> 0:4:8,747
Jay: I love my
kids so much.


107
0:4:8,747 --> 0:4:10,282
I love my
wife so much.


108
0:4:10,282 --> 0:4:13,719
I don't ever want to see
them hurt or to go without


109
0:4:13,719 --> 0:4:16,455
and so if a crowd were
ever to come to my house


110
0:4:16,455 --> 0:4:19,825
for whatever reason, I
would defend my family.


111
0:4:19,825 --> 0:4:21,56
<i> Narrator: Mob violence
 is considered highly</i>


112
0:4:21,56 --> 0:4:24,463
<i> dangerous because it
 is so unpredictable.</i>


113
0:4:24,463 --> 0:4:27,232
<i> To survive, officers are
 trained to cycle through</i>


114
0:4:27,232 --> 0:4:30,302
<i> multiple defense options,
 starting with deterrents</i>


115
0:4:30,302 --> 0:4:33,906
<i> and ending with
 lethal measures.</i>


116
0:4:33,906 --> 0:4:37,376
<i> Police call this continuum
 the Circle of Force.</i>


117
0:4:37,376 --> 0:4:39,778
Jay: Seven things that I
believe are essential for


118
0:4:39,778 --> 0:4:45,184
the circle of force
are: rifle, a handgun,


119
0:4:45,184 --> 0:4:49,21
edged weapons, impact
weapons, pepper spray,


120
0:4:49,21 --> 0:4:51,623
martial arts and
verbal commands.


121
0:4:51,623 --> 0:4:52,324
Jay: Stop!


122
0:4:52,324 --> 0:4:53,359
Get on the
ground!


123
0:4:53,359 --> 0:4:57,162
You can use different
things immediately.


124
0:4:57,162 --> 0:4:58,664
You can go to
whatever option you


125
0:4:58,664 --> 0:5:0,666
need based on
the situation.


126
0:5:0,666 --> 0:5:3,435
You encounter a person and
they're attacking you with


127
0:5:3,435 --> 0:5:6,4
a knife, you don't have
to say something first.


128
0:5:6,4 --> 0:5:9,274
You can go straight to
lethal force because


129
0:5:9,274 --> 0:5:11,744
it's being brought
against you.


130
0:5:11,744 --> 0:5:13,612
<i> Narrator: Jay wants
 to avoid having</i>


131
0:5:13,612 --> 0:5:15,314
<i> to use lethal
 force, if possible.</i>


132
0:5:15,314 --> 0:5:16,782
Jay: Who needs
gloves out there?


133
0:5:16,782 --> 0:5:18,83
Holly: I
need gloves.


134
0:5:18,83 --> 0:5:20,52
<i> Narrator: So today he's
 working with Holly to</i>


135
0:5:20,52 --> 0:5:23,88
<i> install a non-violent
 first line of defense.</i>


136
0:5:23,88 --> 0:5:25,357
<i> One he hopes his entire
 prepping network</i>


137
0:5:25,357 --> 0:5:27,226
<i> can implement to
 persuade looters to</i>


138
0:5:27,226 --> 0:5:29,461
<i> move on to
 other houses.</i>


139
0:5:29,461 --> 0:5:30,796
Jay: The way our
plan is set up,


140
0:5:30,796 --> 0:5:32,798
we have many
families.


141
0:5:32,798 --> 0:5:35,467
In fact we probably 20
families representing


142
0:5:35,467 --> 0:5:38,537
75-100 people involved
in our network.


143
0:5:38,537 --> 0:5:40,706
In a shelter in
place scenario,


144
0:5:40,706 --> 0:5:44,243
the network puts boards
over the windows and


145
0:5:44,243 --> 0:5:46,845
doors in order to secure
the first level and


146
0:5:46,845 --> 0:5:49,214
then the network would
work together to


147
0:5:49,214 --> 0:5:51,417
secure the perimeter
of the property.


148
0:5:51,417 --> 0:5:54,82
So we're basically trying
to get all the entrances,


149
0:5:54,82 --> 0:5:57,423
all the entry points on
the first floor because


150
0:5:57,423 --> 0:5:58,857
those are the points
that are vulnerable


151
0:5:58,857 --> 0:6:0,659
to attack if someone
is trying to get in.


152
0:6:0,659 --> 0:6:1,927
Friend: Okay.


153
0:6:1,927 --> 0:6:3,829
<i> Narrator: Plywood is often
 used to fortify homes in</i>


154
0:6:3,829 --> 0:6:6,231
<i> hurricane zones,
 because it is flexible</i>


155
0:6:6,231 --> 0:6:7,933
<i> and able to absorb
 the impact of</i>


156
0:6:7,933 --> 0:6:10,302
<i> 100 mile per
 hour winds.</i>


157
0:6:10,302 --> 0:6:11,637
Jay: I need the
two-by-four,


158
0:6:11,637 --> 0:6:12,838
who's got that?


159
0:6:12,838 --> 0:6:14,406
<i> Narrator: But anchoring
 plywood boards to the</i>

<i> horizontal
 two-by-four,</i>


162
0:6:17,609 --> 0:6:19,578
<i> gives the wood
 increased strength.</i>


163
0:6:19,578 --> 0:6:22,514
<i> Jay believes it's
 perfect for preppers.</i>


164
0:6:22,514 --> 0:6:23,982
Jay: Push
on it guys.


165
0:6:23,982 --> 0:6:25,918
<i> Narrator: Because a

 repeated blunt force</i>

0:6:27,753 --> 0:6:30,823
<i> attacks without
 cracking or breaking.</i>


168

<i> Jay has custom
 pieces ready to go,</i>

<i> so that he and Holly can

<i> downstairs windows in
 half an hour or less.</i>


171
0:6:38,997 --> 0:6:41,133
Jay: If you hear beating
on this window right here,


172
0:6:41,133 --> 0:6:43,435
you'll know okay I
got to go upstairs,


173
0:6:43,435 --> 0:6:45,7
look down and see
what's going on and


174
0:6:45,7 --> 0:6:46,71
try to take care
of that threat.


175
0:6:46,71 --> 0:6:47,105
Holly: Okay.


176
0:6:47,105 --> 0:6:48,54
Okay, I can do it.


177
0:6:48,54 --> 0:6:49,975
Jay: They wouldn't
last forever.


178
0:6:49,975 --> 0:6:51,376
If you had an
unlimited amount of


179
0:6:51,376 --> 0:6:53,278
time you could probably
chop or hack through them,


180
0:6:53,278 --> 0:6:56,548
maybe pry them off.


181
0:6:56,548 --> 0:6:59,251

pretty good.

0:7:12,731 --> 0:7:13,699
There you go.

0:7:21,74 --> 0:7:24,176
Friend: Come
on, harder.


195
0:7:24,176 --> 0:7:25,644
Katie: Come on, your
kids are hungry.


196
0:7:25,644 --> 0:7:26,812
Friend: Harder!


197
0:7:26,812 --> 0:7:27,946
Friend 2: You can't
hit it hard enough


198
0:7:27,946 --> 0:7:28,981
to make it go through.


199
0:7:28,981 --> 0:7:30,115
Holly: By the time you
hear them doing it,


200
0:7:30,115 --> 0:7:31,283
you're going
to shoot them.


201
0:7:31,283 --> 0:7:32,384
Jay: Holly will
be upstairs with


202
0:7:32,384 --> 0:7:33,852
the .22,
hopefully.


203
0:7:33,852 --> 0:7:35,587
Holly: Picking
you off.


204
0:7:35,587 --> 0:7:36,588
Jay: Yeah,
all right.


205
0:7:36,588 --> 0:7:37,623
Good.


206
0:7:37,623 --> 0:7:39,424
The way that we've
designed this is that


207
0:7:39,424 --> 0:7:41,927
we put the boards over
just the first level,


208
0:7:41,927 --> 0:7:43,462
so that on the
second level we can


209
0:7:43,462 --> 0:7:44,763
watch from there.


210
0:7:44,763 --> 0:7:46,765
We can utilize the
different weapons


211
0:7:46,765 --> 0:7:49,101
we have to defend
the homes.


212
0:7:49,101 --> 0:7:51,57
<i> Narrator: But rather than
 rain down lethal bullets,</i>


213
0:7:51,57 --> 0:7:54,773
<i> Jay's moving up the Circle
 of Force to a non-lethal</i>


214
0:7:54,773 --> 0:7:58,844
<i> measure, one used by
 97% of American police</i>


215
0:7:58,844 --> 0:8:1,146
<i> departments for
 crowd control.</i>


216
0:8:1,146 --> 0:8:3,715
Jay: We do manufacture
our own pepper spray here.


217
0:8:3,715 --> 0:8:5,384
If you have a group of
armed people outside of


218
0:8:5,384 --> 0:8:8,22
your house I wanted
to have an option to


219
0:8:8,22 --> 0:8:10,255
encourage them to
get of the property.


220
0:8:10,255 --> 0:8:12,891
Having had pepper spray
used on me in the Police


221
0:8:12,891 --> 0:8:15,894
Academy, I know it
works very well.


222
0:8:15,894 --> 0:8:18,797
I do recall one person
actually crying for their


223
0:8:18,797 --> 0:8:21,5
mommy when they were
sprayed with pepper spray.


224
0:8:21,5 --> 0:8:22,968
<i> Narrator: The base
 ingredient of law</i>


225

226
0:8:25,771 --> 0:8:28,44
<i> the active component

229

231
0:8:39,117 --> 0:8:42,22
<i> Jay believes he can make
 a homemade brew potent</i>


232
0:8:42,22 --> 0:8:45,958
<i> enough to cause temporary
 pain and blindness.</i>


233
0:8:45,958 --> 0:8:47,759
Jay: And then the
Habanera sauce of course


234
0:8:47,759 --> 0:8:50,295
is to burn
your face off.


235
0:8:50,295 --> 0:8:53,231
The whole bottle.


236
0:8:53,231 --> 0:8:57,35
Friend: That's
really gonna hurt.


237
0:8:57,35 --> 0:8:58,47
Jay: That's perfect.


238
0:8:58,47 --> 0:9:0,973
Friend: That's not gonna
feel very good on my face.


239
0:9:0,973 --> 0:9:2,374
Friend 2: So how are
you gonna deliver this?


240
0:9:2,374 --> 0:9:3,709
I mean, are you gonna
splash it on me,


241
0:9:3,709 --> 0:9:4,843
are we gonna dip
our face in there?


242
0:9:4,843 --> 0:9:5,777
I mean what
do you?


243
0:9:5,777 --> 0:9:7,579
Jay: Well actually
lemme go get it and


244
0:9:7,579 --> 0:9:9,14
I'll tell you.


245
0:9:9,14 --> 0:9:11,16
<i> Narrator: For delivery,
 Jay's repurposed a</i>


246
0:9:11,16 --> 0:9:13,785

<i> has a range of 30 feet
 and is inconspicuous</i>


248
0:9:16,855 --> 0:9:19,57
<i> in a neighborhood
 filled with children.</i>


249
0:9:19,57 --> 0:9:20,759
Jay: Okay guys, so this
is our sophisticated


250
0:9:20,759 --> 0:9:21,994
delivery system here.


251
0:9:21,994 --> 0:9:24,696
Friend: Water guns of,
uh, death and fire.


252
0:9:24,696 --> 0:9:26,632
<i> Narrator: Jay's recipe
 should be strong enough to</i>


253
0:9:26,632 --> 0:9:29,668
<i> cause excruciating
 pain, burning and</i>


254
0:9:29,668 --> 0:9:32,671
<i> involuntary swelling of
 the eyes and throat.</i>


255
0:9:32,671 --> 0:9:34,673

 a half seconds.</i>


258
0:9:40,579 --> 0:9:42,914

0:9:44,816 --> 0:9:48,86
<i> close enough to assault
 him, it's useless.</i>


261
0:9:48,86 --> 0:9:48,954
Jay: Stop
right there!


262
0:9:48,954 --> 0:9:49,855
What do
you want?


263
0:9:49,855 --> 0:9:50,722
Friends: We're
taking what we need!


264
0:9:50,722 --> 0:9:51,623
Jay: Stop
right there!


265
0:9:51,623 --> 0:9:52,457
Friend: We're
going in!


266
0:9:52,457 --> 0:9:54,493
We're taking
what we need!


267
0:9:54,493 --> 0:9:56,561
We're taking it!


268
0:9:56,561 --> 0:9:58,497
Ahh, ahh!


269
0:9:58,497 --> 0:9:59,531
Jay: Stop!


270
0:9:59,531 --> 0:10:0,565
Stay down!


271
0:10:0,565 --> 0:10:1,9
Friends: Owwww!


272
0:10:1,9 --> 0:10:3,435
Uhhh, owww!


273
0:10:3,435 --> 0:10:5,37
Jay: Pepper spray
feels like having


274
0:10:5,37 --> 0:10:6,905
liquid magma
on your face.


275
0:10:6,905 --> 0:10:8,106
Friend: Oh,
it works!


276
0:10:8,106 --> 0:10:9,207
Jay: Put your
head down,


277
0:10:9,207 --> 0:10:10,242
otherwise it's going to
just go all over you.


278
0:10:10,242 --> 0:10:11,9
Ready?


279
0:10:11,9 --> 0:10:11,943
Friend: What
is this?


280
0:10:11,943 --> 0:10:13,612
Jay: It's
the milk.


281
0:10:13,612 --> 0:10:14,646
Friend: It
definitely stopped


282
0:10:14,646 --> 0:10:16,114
what I wanted
to do.


283
0:10:16,114 --> 0:10:17,683
<i> Narrator: Jay's
 pepper spray worked,</i>


284
0:10:17,683 --> 0:10:18,951
<i> but not fast enough.</i>


285
0:10:18,951 --> 0:10:21,887
<i> Trevor and Eric were able
 to reach his position</i>


286
0:10:21,887 --> 0:10:24,589
<i> before the spray
 took effect.</i>


287
0:10:24,589 --> 0:10:27,192
<i> So he's ready to move
 up the Circle of Force</i>


288
0:10:27,192 --> 0:10:29,661
<i> to more extreme
 options.</i>


289
0:10:29,661 --> 0:10:31,229
<i> To prepare for

292
0:10:36,68 --> 0:10:39,104
<i> Now, they'll set their
 sights on each other,</i>


293
0:10:39,104 --> 0:10:48,847
<i> for the ultimate test
 of home security.</i>


294
0:10:48,847 --> 0:10:51,83
<i> Narrator: Former police
 officer Jay Blevins has</i>


295

 a suburban stronghold.</i>


296
0:10:54,186 --> 0:10:56,121
Jay: This can be a
suburban fortress,


297
0:10:56,121 --> 0:10:59,91
a place where my
family can be safe.


298
0:10:59,91 --> 0:11:1,66
<i> Narrator: Behind these

<i> marauders following

301
0:11:7,99 --> 0:11:9,468
<i> But he doesn't plan
 on doing it alone.</i>


302
0:11:9,468 --> 0:11:12,204
<i> In Jay's densely
 populated cul-de-sac,</i>


303
0:11:12,204 --> 0:11:14,139
<i> neighbors could
 easily turn into</i>


304
0:11:14,139 --> 0:11:15,841
<i> the mob he fears.</i>


305
0:11:15,841 --> 0:11:17,943
<i> But Jay hopes to
 preempt this threat,</i>


306
0:11:17,943 --> 0:11:19,244
<i> by recruiting
 his neighbors</i>


307
0:11:19,244 --> 0:11:21,113
<i> into a prepping
 network.</i>


308
0:11:21,113 --> 0:11:23,381
<i> Together, he believes

310
0:11:26,451 --> 0:11:29,121
<i> including
 lethal force.</i>


311
0:11:29,121 --> 0:11:30,856
Jay: We have a group
here at the house


312
0:11:30,856 --> 0:11:32,19
that meets
once a month.


313
0:11:32,19 --> 0:11:34,126
It's my network
of preppers.


314
0:11:34,126 --> 0:11:35,527
Prepping is a
growing movement.


315
0:11:35,527 --> 0:11:37,429
Specifically this
year, I would say,


316
0:11:37,429 --> 0:11:39,264
the group has
doubled in size.


317
0:11:39,264 --> 0:11:41,233
<i> Narrator: Today, Jay

<i> all his preps: a mob
 assault on the front door.</i>


320
0:11:49,141 --> 0:11:52,43
<i> Armed with pellet guns,
 Jay will lead one team</i>


321
0:11:52,43 --> 0:11:54,913

<i> Patrick, a certified
 firearms expert,</i>


323
0:11:57,916 --> 0:12:0,318
<i> will work with Holly and
 a second team inside the</i>

0:12:0,318 --> 0:12:10,128
<i> house to neutralize
 the marauders.</i>


325
0:12:10,128 --> 0:12:11,363

the house secure!


326
0:12:11,363 --> 0:12:12,264
Get the doors
locked!


327
0:12:12,264 --> 0:12:13,331
Get the windows
locked!


328
0:12:13,331 --> 0:12:14,833
You're using this
wall as cover,


329
0:12:14,833 --> 0:12:17,35
so when they come through
they're not gonna be able


330
0:12:17,35 --> 0:12:19,137
to see you, so you can
pop out and engage.


331
0:12:19,137 --> 0:12:21,239
<i> Narrator: Not knowing from
 what direction the attack</i>


332
0:12:21,239 --> 0:12:24,142
<i> will come, the goal is to
 see if they can use their</i>


333
0:12:24,142 --> 0:12:27,78
<i> preps to take control
 of the situation.</i>


334
0:12:27,78 --> 0:12:29,514
<i> They hope the boarded-up
 windows will direct</i>


335
0:12:29,514 --> 0:12:32,5
<i> intruders toward the only
 available entry point:</i>


336
0:12:32,5 --> 0:12:33,685
<i> the front door.</i>


337
0:12:33,685 --> 0:12:36,221
<i> The plan is to turn
 it into a kill-box,</i>


338
0:12:36,221 --> 0:12:38,423
<i> a bottleneck where
 intruders can be</i>


339
0:12:38,423 --> 0:12:40,325
<i> shot down from
 multiple angles.</i>


340
0:12:40,325 --> 0:12:42,394
Patrick: Remember, they
all still have to get


341
0:12:42,394 --> 0:12:43,929
through the
funnel of death.


342
0:12:43,929 --> 0:12:45,864
They've gotta get
through that choke point.


343
0:12:45,864 --> 0:13:0,912
Jay: All right
guys, game faces on.


344
0:13:0,912 --> 0:13:2,147
Man: Is this
John's house?


345
0:13:2,147 --> 0:13:3,648
Girl: Get off
the property!


346
0:13:3,648 --> 0:13:4,649
Jay: Oh hey.


347
0:13:4,649 --> 0:13:5,784
We're just
looking for John.


348
0:13:5,784 --> 0:13:6,885
What are
you doing?


349
0:13:6,885 --> 0:13:8,687
I got pepper
sprayed!


350
0:13:8,687 --> 0:13:14,259
Are they shooting
up there?


351
0:13:14,259 --> 0:13:15,16
Go!


352
0:13:15,16 --> 0:13:21,666
Go!


353
0:13:21,666 --> 0:13:23,68
Patrick: Library,
report.


354
0:13:23,68 --> 0:13:24,836
Holly: VCA down
in the library.


355
0:13:24,836 --> 0:13:27,72
Patrick: Close the
front door and lock it!


356
0:13:27,72 --> 0:13:31,843
All operators into
the family room!


357
0:13:31,843 --> 0:13:33,44
Scenario's over.


358
0:13:33,44 --> 0:13:35,413
Safeties on,
guns holstered.


359
0:13:35,413 --> 0:13:37,15
Muzzles down.


360
0:13:37,15 --> 0:13:38,65
<i> Narrator: In all,
 50 shots were</i>


361
0:13:38,65 --> 0:13:40,452
<i> fired in today's
 assault.</i>


362
0:13:40,452 --> 0:13:42,287
<i> All three of the
 mob assailants were</i>


363
0:13:42,287 --> 0:13:45,9
<i> "killed" within 3 feet
 of the front door.</i>


364
0:13:45,9 --> 0:13:46,391
Jay: Ah dude,
I got lit up.


365
0:13:46,391 --> 0:13:48,226
I came in straight
and to the right.


366
0:13:48,226 --> 0:13:49,861
Bullets seemed like
they were coming from


367
0:13:49,861 --> 0:13:51,229
the front and the side.


368
0:13:51,229 --> 0:13:53,732
And I got hit about I
don't know, 14 times.


369
0:13:53,732 --> 0:13:55,667
There was like four
or five fatal shots.


370
0:13:55,667 --> 0:13:57,168
Holly: As soon as I
heard the front door


371
0:13:57,168 --> 0:13:59,638
get kicked open, I was
already ready for them.


372
0:13:59,638 --> 0:14:3,942
And I got Jamie and then
I got Dan and about ten


373
0:14:3,942 --> 0:14:5,51
seconds later Ryan
came to the door


374
0:14:5,51 --> 0:14:7,245
and I, to the
chest immediately.


375
0:14:7,245 --> 0:14:8,747
So I got all 3, yay!


376
0:14:8,747 --> 0:14:12,55
My only thought is to
make sure that none


377
0:14:12,55 --> 0:14:14,486
of these men get
past me to my kids.


378
0:14:14,486 --> 0:14:16,488
Jay: So the moral of the
story is be the good guys,

0:14:16,488 --> 0:14:17,822
not the bad guys.


380
0:14:17,822 --> 0:14:19,724
In a prepper situation,
it's good to have a


381
0:14:19,724 --> 0:14:22,827
variety of different
things at your disposal to


382
0:14:22,827 --> 0:14:25,13
deal with the person
that is attacking you.


383
0:14:25,13 --> 0:14:27,666
A lot of times people
think that preppers are


384
0:14:27,666 --> 0:14:30,568
sort of a subculture
or a fringe of society.


385
0:14:30,568 --> 0:14:32,771
But if an economic
collapse takes place,


386
0:14:32,771 --> 0:14:34,873
I do believe that
our prepper network


387
0:14:34,873 --> 0:14:38,176
will survive.


388
0:14:38,176 --> 0:14:39,711

391
0:14:45,483 --> 0:14:48,219
<i> Additionally, by working
 with a prepper network,</i>


392
0:14:48,219 --> 0:14:51,89
<i> you diversify the skills
 at your disposal and</i>


393

<i> further protect
 your family.</i>


394
0:14:52,991 --> 0:14:55,76
<i> However, while your
 security is adequate,</i>


395
0:14:55,76 --> 0:14:58,596
<i> your food and water
 storage are insufficient.</i>


396
0:14:58,596 --> 0:15:0,98
Jay: I think we do need
to get a little bit


397
0:15:0,98 --> 0:15:1,733
more in our
food storage.


398
0:15:1,733 --> 0:15:3,735
Uh, but we also
have in our network,


399
0:15:3,735 --> 0:15:6,438
some folks that can do
hunting and trapping.

 long you could initially</i>

402
0:15:10,942 --> 0:15:14,446
<i> scored your preps in five
 categories of 20 points</i>

<i> Security: 16 out
 of 20 points.</i>


409
0:15:33,531 --> 0:15:36,634
<i> In addition, your network
 of preppers is excellent</i>


410
0:15:36,634 --> 0:15:39,337
<i> and will increase your
 family's odds of survival.</i>


411
0:15:39,337 --> 0:15:41,473
<i> 13 x-factor points.</i>


412
0:15:41,473 --> 0:15:45,543
<i> Overall, you get 58
 out of 100 points.</i>


413
0:15:45,543 --> 0:15:48,88
<i> You have eight months
 initial survival time.</i>


414
0:15:48,88 --> 0:15:50,582
Jay: I think we're doing
a little bit better in a


415
0:15:50,582 --> 0:15:52,384
couple of those areas,
but there is definitely


416
0:15:52,384 --> 0:15:53,485
room for improvement.


417
0:15:53,485 --> 0:15:55,86
We'll definitely take
a lot of those into


418
0:15:55,86 --> 0:15:56,855
consideration 'cause
we do wanna survive


419
0:15:56,855 --> 0:15:59,891
a lot longer.


420
0:15:59,891 --> 0:16:1,626
Since National
Geographic was here,


421
0:16:1,626 --> 0:16:4,62
we've planted fruit trees,
a large garden and other


422
0:16:4,62 --> 0:16:6,631
edible plants and have
begun canning and will


423
0:16:6,631 --> 0:16:11,803
continue to do so for
long term storage.

436
0:16:41,966 --> 0:16:46,104

449
0:17:12,564 --> 0:17:15,7

50 acres of land.

0:21:36,527 --> 0:21:38,62
Run for our
lives, you know.


560
0:21:38,62 --> 0:21:43,434
She's had to blindly jump
off a cliff, you know,


561
0:21:43,434 --> 0:21:45,67
to take the risk to
come here to America.


562
0:21:45,67 --> 0:21:51,642
Tatiana: I can't believe
I came here to die.


563
0:21:51,642 --> 0:21:55,113
You didn't tell
me that before.


564
0:21:55,113 --> 0:21:57,281
Brian is telling me
a little about it.


565
0:21:57,281 --> 0:22:1,152
Like, because things
that are happening here


566
0:22:1,152 --> 0:22:6,9
in your country, you
know you're afraid that,


567
0:22:6,9 --> 0:22:8,426
war is coming.


568
0:22:8,426 --> 0:22:10,695
When Brian told
me he was a prepper,


569
0:22:10,695 --> 0:22:15,133
I thought that
he was crazy.


570
0:22:15,133 --> 0:22:17,468
In Colombia we
don't do it.


571
0:22:17,468 --> 0:22:19,837
It's like a new
concept for us.


572
0:22:19,837 --> 0:22:22,373
We don't know about saving
food for the bad times,


573
0:22:22,373 --> 0:22:24,442
you know because
there are bad times


574
0:22:24,442 --> 0:22:27,211
all the time over
there I guess.


575
0:22:27,211 --> 0:22:29,547
But when I marry Brian
I will become a prepper


576
0:22:29,547 --> 0:22:33,251
because I will support him
in whatever he's up to.


577
0:22:33,251 --> 0:22:34,419
He's very wise.


578
0:22:34,419 --> 0:22:40,391
I will be the perfect
prepper one day.


579
0:22:40,391 --> 0:22:44,729
I hope.


580
0:22:44,729 --> 0:22:46,431

 a moment's notice.</i>


584
0:22:55,106 --> 0:22:58,509
<i> So before Tatiana has even
 unpacked her suitcase,</i>


585
0:22:58,509 --> 0:23:1,279
<i> he wants her to
 prepare a bug-out bag</i>


586
0:23:1,279 --> 0:23:5,416
<i> free of any
 extraneous luxuries.</i>


587
0:23:5,416 --> 0:23:7,84
Brian: We'll
ease into it.


588
0:23:7,84 --> 0:23:8,319
We'll go through
your stuff,


589
0:23:8,319 --> 0:23:11,189
you know and kinda get
an idea of what's good


590
0:23:11,189 --> 0:23:12,757
and what's not, you know.


591
0:23:12,757 --> 0:23:17,528
Did you bring
a lot of stuff?


592
0:23:17,528 --> 0:23:18,83
Got all mangled
up, huh?


593
0:23:18,83 --> 0:23:20,231
Tatiana: My
creams, lotions.


594
0:23:20,231 --> 0:23:21,666
Brian: Oh boy.


595
0:23:21,666 --> 0:23:24,635
Baby, what are
these honestly?


596
0:23:24,635 --> 0:23:26,871
These are beautiful shoes
for going out on the town


597
0:23:26,871 --> 0:23:31,476
but ah, if, if we really
had to bug-out and


598
0:23:31,476 --> 0:23:33,845
get out of town and we
had to move quick,


599
0:23:33,845 --> 0:23:37,882
do you think this
is, I say that


600
0:23:37,882 --> 0:23:39,16
with all due
respect.


601
0:23:39,16 --> 0:23:41,752
I'm trying to, you
know, get you to think.


602
0:23:41,752 --> 0:23:44,555
Tatiana: See now
you're scaring me.


603
0:23:44,555 --> 0:23:47,258
I came to America 'cause
this is a safe place


604
0:23:47,258 --> 0:23:48,759
and now we have
to run away.


605
0:23:48,759 --> 0:23:49,994
Brian: I know,
it's funny.


606
0:23:49,994 --> 0:23:53,331
Tatiana: I don't know it's
very emotional because,


607
0:23:53,331 --> 0:23:56,701
you know I'm
like nobody here.


608
0:23:56,701 --> 0:23:59,904
I can't go outside,
I don't have a job.


609
0:23:59,904 --> 0:24:1,939
I don't have
friends here.


610
0:24:1,939 --> 0:24:3,608
It's sad because I'm
leaving everything,


611
0:24:3,608 --> 0:24:6,577
you know and I'm
starting like a baby.


612
0:24:6,577 --> 0:24:9,947
I tell Brian, you have
to teach me everything,


613
0:24:9,947 --> 0:24:14,118
like I don't know
many things here.


614
0:24:14,118 --> 0:24:17,154
And I'm leaving my
family and my mom,


615
0:24:17,154 --> 0:24:20,658
my daughter, my dad
and that is hard.


616
0:24:20,658 --> 0:24:23,361
You know?


617
0:24:23,361 --> 0:24:25,897
Will I be allowed
to have a razor?


618
0:24:25,897 --> 0:24:27,265
Brian: Will you be
allowed to have a razor?


619
0:24:27,265 --> 0:24:28,966
Of course.


620
0:24:28,966 --> 0:24:31,335
Why wouldn't you be?


621
0:24:31,335 --> 0:24:33,437
Some aspects of her
adjustment to America


622
0:24:33,437 --> 0:24:34,939
that are going to
be tough for her.


623
0:24:34,939 --> 0:24:37,642
Even though Tatiana is
unaware of it right now.


624
0:24:37,642 --> 0:24:40,611
Time will reveal to her
that she is a prepper.


625
0:24:40,611 --> 0:24:42,413
<i> Narrator: Before she's
 even had a chance to</i>

<i> natural prepper instinct
 Tatiana possesses</i>


628
0:24:47,785 --> 0:24:50,254
<i> and how much he'll
 have to teach her.</i>


629
0:24:50,254 --> 0:24:52,323
Brian: I think it's very
important to teach her


630
0:24:52,323 --> 0:24:54,692
necessary skills
to protect us.


631
0:24:54,692 --> 0:24:57,595
<i> Narrator: So, just
 hours after she arrived,</i>


632
0:24:57,595 --> 0:25:0,164
<i> he's decided to put
 Tatiana through her first</i>


633
0:25:0,164 --> 0:25:2,5
<i> full-fledged
 bug-out drill.</i>


634
0:25:2,5 --> 0:25:5,202
<i> But is Tatiana really
 ready to accept</i>


635
0:25:5,202 --> 0:25:7,838
<i> the life of a doomsday
 prepper wife?</i>


636
0:25:7,838 --> 0:25:8,94
Brian: What are you just
going to wait inside?


637
0:25:8,94 --> 0:25:13,444
Tatiana: Yes, thank you.


638
0:25:13,444 --> 0:25:15,313
<i> Narrator: Brian Murdock

0:25:28,426 --> 0:25:30,861
<i> But Brian believes it's

<i> down pat first.</i>


646
0:25:35,566 --> 0:25:39,103
<i> So even though she's only
 just arrived in the U.S.,</i>


647
0:25:39,103 --> 0:25:42,173
<i> it's already time for her
 to leave Somerville behind</i>


648
0:25:42,173 --> 0:25:46,477
<i> and experience her
 first bug-out drill.</i>


649
0:25:46,477 --> 0:25:47,345
Brian: Let's
bug-out.


650
0:25:47,345 --> 0:25:48,379
We're getting
out of here.


651
0:25:48,379 --> 0:25:49,46
Come on.


652
0:25:49,46 --> 0:25:49,747
We're bugging out.


653
0:25:49,747 --> 0:25:55,653
Let's go, babe.


654
0:25:55,653 --> 0:25:56,687
Tatiana: My sandal.


655
0:25:56,687 --> 0:25:57,421
Brian: I got it.


656
0:25:57,421 --> 0:25:58,756
I got.


657
0:25:58,756 --> 0:25:59,957
Tatiana: My sandal.


658
0:25:59,957 --> 0:26:1,359
Brian: Don't
worry about it.


659
0:26:1,359 --> 0:26:10,368
You're not going to need
that where we're going.


660
0:26:10,368 --> 0:26:13,27
<i> Narrator: Brian's RV will
 operate both as a home</i>


661
0:26:13,27 --> 0:26:17,341
<i> and a defense outpost
 for the couple.</i>


662
0:26:17,341 --> 0:26:20,878
<i> He expects Tatiana will
 learn to use firearms and</i>


663

<i> water he keeps
 in the RV.</i>


665
0:26:24,315 --> 0:26:25,983
Brian: So babe now that
we're here at the land,


666
0:26:25,983 --> 0:26:27,551
I'll be teaching
you how to keep


667
0:26:27,551 --> 0:26:29,12
the perimeter safe.


668
0:26:29,12 --> 0:26:31,322
And you're going to
have the opportunity


669
0:26:31,322 --> 0:26:33,324
to fire your
first handgun.


670
0:26:33,324 --> 0:26:35,92
Get you comfortable
with a firearm,


671
0:26:35,92 --> 0:26:37,828
we'll work our way into uh
working on the perimeter.


672
0:26:37,828 --> 0:26:39,93
This is better than the
living room isn't it?


673
0:26:39,93 --> 0:26:42,266
You feeling
comfortable here?


674
0:26:42,266 --> 0:26:46,137
Tatiana: I have to
see how it goes.


675
0:26:46,137 --> 0:26:48,673
And I will tell
you how I feel.


676
0:26:48,673 --> 0:26:49,874
Brian: I understand.


677
0:26:49,874 --> 0:26:54,712
Tatiana: Let's see if the
bugs leave me alone here.


678
0:26:54,712 --> 0:26:57,948
Brian: The bugs
like light skin,


679
0:26:57,948 --> 0:27:0,151
so I think
you'll be okay.


680
0:27:0,151 --> 0:27:2,653
Tatiana: Yeah right now
the bugs are bothering me.


681
0:27:2,653 --> 0:27:4,388
I need to get out
of here right now.


682
0:27:4,388 --> 0:27:6,157
Meet you inside.


683
0:27:6,157 --> 0:27:7,291
Brian: You're just
going to leave me


684
0:27:7,291 --> 0:27:8,325
out here like that?


685
0:27:8,325 --> 0:27:9,727
Don't you think we're
going to need to get


686
0:27:9,727 --> 0:27:11,896
used to this if we're
gonna live up here?


687
0:27:11,896 --> 0:27:14,699
Tatiana: Let's
see what happens.


688
0:27:14,699 --> 0:27:18,2
Brian: Well,
I understand.


689
0:27:18,2 --> 0:27:20,538
But this is, this is
the North Country.


690
0:27:20,538 --> 0:27:22,707
This is God's
country up here.


691
0:27:22,707 --> 0:27:23,507
You know?


692
0:27:23,507 --> 0:27:24,308
There's a lot
of bugs.


693
0:27:24,308 --> 0:27:25,576
I've got
bug spray.


694
0:27:25,576 --> 0:27:27,111
Tatiana: Okay, I
will put on some.


695
0:27:27,111 --> 0:27:28,212
Brian: What are
you going to do?


696
0:27:28,212 --> 0:27:29,18
Just wait inside?


697
0:27:29,18 --> 0:27:30,281
Tatiana:
Yes, thank you.


698
0:27:30,281 --> 0:27:31,482
Brian: Ah, alright.


699
0:27:31,482 --> 0:27:32,65
I'll get the
fire going.


700
0:27:32,65 --> 0:27:33,951
I'll get the
uh venison on.


701
0:27:33,951 --> 0:27:34,719
Tatiana: Okay.


702
0:27:34,719 --> 0:27:35,352
Brian: All right?


703
0:27:35,352 --> 0:27:36,187
Tatiana: Okay.


704
0:27:36,187 --> 0:27:37,188
See you later.


705
0:27:37,188 --> 0:27:38,456
Brian: Go to work on
the beans and rice.


706
0:27:38,456 --> 0:27:39,223
All right baby.


707
0:27:39,223 --> 0:27:40,157
I love you.


708
0:27:40,157 --> 0:27:42,493
Tatiana: I guess
preppers are a little,


709
0:27:42,493 --> 0:27:46,497
little bit crazy.


710
0:27:46,497 --> 0:27:48,966
Don't get upset.


711
0:27:48,966 --> 0:27:51,202
Brian: Tatiana's got a
little learning to do,


712
0:27:51,202 --> 0:27:53,437
but soon we'll
be married and


713
0:27:53,437 --> 0:27:55,473
I know we'll
be happy here.


714
0:27:55,473 --> 0:27:57,508
<i> Narrator: After a tough
 initial adjustment,</i>


715
0:27:57,508 --> 0:28:0,344
<i> Tatiana is ready for her
 first shooting lesson.</i>


716
0:28:0,344 --> 0:28:3,314
<i> One important advantage
 of prepper partnering is</i>


717
0:28:3,314 --> 0:28:5,15
<i> always having backup.</i>


718
0:28:5,15 --> 0:28:7,451
<i> Just as World War II
 soldiers were assigned to</i>


719
0:28:7,451 --> 0:28:10,54
<i> defend trenches and
 foxholes in pairs,</i>


720
0:28:10,54 --> 0:28:12,69
<i> Brian believes it is
 essential he and Tatiana</i>


721
0:28:12,69 --> 0:28:15,226
<i> are both able to
 defend the RV.</i>


722
0:28:15,226 --> 0:28:18,696
<i> So today, he's teaching
 her to shoot a handgun for</i>


723
0:28:18,696 --> 0:28:20,364
<i> the first time.</i>


724
0:28:20,364 --> 0:28:22,6
Brian: So as you know,
this is an important part


725
0:28:22,6 --> 0:28:25,2
of our prepping and
central to the blessings


726
0:28:25,2 --> 0:28:26,871
of being an American
and the 2nd amendment.


727
0:28:26,871 --> 0:28:28,572
I have a banana
up there for you.


728
0:28:28,572 --> 0:28:30,674
It was the closest I
could come to a plantain.


729
0:28:30,674 --> 0:28:32,209
I know you like
plantains.


730
0:28:32,209 --> 0:28:33,911
Want to give
it a shot?


731
0:28:33,911 --> 0:28:35,12
Tatiana: I will try.


732
0:28:35,12 --> 0:28:36,13
Brian: Alright.


733
0:28:36,13 --> 0:28:38,349
Tatiana: I don't want
to offend anybody,


734
0:28:38,349 --> 0:28:43,2
but it's a little bit
arrogant to think that


735
0:28:43,2 --> 0:28:45,222
you're gonna
save yourself,


736
0:28:45,222 --> 0:28:52,363
you know because I think if
God wants you to you know,


737
0:28:52,363 --> 0:28:54,632
that you're not
alive anymore.


738
0:28:54,632 --> 0:28:57,968
He will do it, no
matter how many water,


739
0:28:57,968 --> 0:29:0,671
how much water you

740
0:29:0,671 --> 0:29:2,54

741
0:29:2,54 --> 0:29:7,211
I hope you know that
everything I'm doing


742
0:29:7,211 --> 0:29:8,846
it's because I love you.


743
0:29:8,846 --> 0:29:10,981
And I want to share
everything with you.


744
0:29:10,981 --> 0:29:16,253
Your life and all your
experiences prepping and


745
0:29:16,253 --> 0:29:18,722
all that, because
I love you.


746
0:29:18,722 --> 0:29:20,291
Brian: I appreciate that
baby and I love you too.


747
0:29:20,291 --> 0:29:23,494
Tatiana: Sometimes,
I want to kill you.


748
0:29:23,494 --> 0:29:27,865
Brian: I love
you, too.


749
0:29:27,865 --> 0:29:32,403
Tatiana has already been
prepared to be a prepper,


750
0:29:32,403 --> 0:29:34,672
she may not know it but
I think she'll realize,


751
0:29:34,672 --> 0:29:37,441
like, "Yeah Brian, you
know, this makes sense.


752
0:29:37,441 --> 0:29:40,477
This is who I am too."


753
0:29:40,477 --> 0:29:43,214
It's a life-changing event
when you meet the right


754
0:29:43,214 --> 0:29:50,621
person to share
your life with.

Brian: A hundred

765
0:30:13,21 --> 0:30:15,212

788
0:31:14,305 --> 0:31:16,941
Brian: Yeah, I'm glad
you folks have been uh,


789
0:31:16,941 --> 0:31:18,742
crystal clear
honest about this.


790
0:31:18,742 --> 0:31:21,312
It just reminds
us of, you know,


791
0:31:21,312 --> 0:31:26,483
the intensity with which
we need to raise our game.


792
0:31:26,483 --> 0:31:29,19
Tatiana and I have
tied the knot and ah,


793
0:31:29,19 --> 0:31:31,522
we are moving in three
days to that location.


794
0:31:31,522 --> 0:31:32,556
We are getting out.


795
0:31:32,556 --> 0:31:34,124
Things have heated
up in the world.


796
0:31:34,124 --> 0:31:36,56
At that time, once we
are at our destination,


797
0:31:36,56 --> 0:31:38,228
we intend to
aggressively add to our


798
0:31:38,228 --> 0:31:41,732

813
0:32:16,266 --> 0:32:17,768
Bryan: Everybody knows
where the San Andreas


814
0:32:17,768 --> 0:32:19,57
Fault line is but not
a lot of people know


815
0:32:19,57 --> 0:32:22,306
where the Madrid
Fault line is.


816
0:32:22,306 --> 0:32:24,74
We're preparing for the
New Madrid earthquake


817
0:32:24,74 --> 0:32:31,382
that would change the
world as we know it.


818
0:32:31,382 --> 0:32:33,984
Me and my
wife, we prep.


819
0:32:33,984 --> 0:32:35,419
We're a prepping
family and


820
0:32:35,419 --> 0:32:37,21
she's right
there beside me.


821
0:32:37,21 --> 0:32:42,26
Lacey: I think the male
prepper is a stereotype.


822
0:32:42,26 --> 0:32:44,728
I'm sure there's more
women preppers out there.


823
0:32:44,728 --> 0:32:46,23
Once I became
a mother,


824
0:32:46,23 --> 0:32:50,801
I definitely started to
think about the future and


825
0:32:50,801 --> 0:32:54,738
just having extra things
that would be needed.


826
0:32:54,738 --> 0:32:58,208
My nightmare is not
having what I need


827
0:32:58,208 --> 0:33:1,211
to provide to my child.


828
0:33:1,211 --> 0:33:2,98
<i> Narrator: The highest

<i> In 1811 and 1812, a series
 of nearly 8.0 magnitude</i>


835
0:33:22,299 --> 0:33:25,469
<i> earthquakes rocked the
 New Madrid each one</i>


836
0:33:25,469 --> 0:33:28,338
<i> roughly as powerful as
 the 1906 earthquake</i>


837
0:33:28,338 --> 0:33:30,607
<i> that destroyed
 San Francisco.</i>


838
0:33:30,607 --> 0:33:33,31
<i> In 1812, the
 New Madrid area</i>


839
0:33:33,31 --> 0:33:35,579
<i> was relatively
 unpopulated.</i>


840
0:33:35,579 --> 0:33:38,916
<i> Today, more than 10
 million Americans live</i>


841
0:33:38,916 --> 0:33:40,717
<i> within the fault zone.</i>


842
0:33:40,717 --> 0:33:42,619
Bryan: We're talking
about just major cities


843
0:33:42,619 --> 0:33:43,921
being affected by this.


844
0:33:43,921 --> 0:33:45,556
There will be no
food inside the


845
0:33:45,556 --> 0:33:47,224
grocery stores
after three days.


846
0:33:47,224 --> 0:33:50,427
So if no one
has preps,


847
0:33:50,427 --> 0:33:51,895
they would
basically starve.


848
0:33:51,895 --> 0:33:53,964
Lacey: People who don't
plan wouldn't know


849
0:33:53,964 --> 0:33:56,934
what to do and so they
would be wreaking havoc


850
0:33:56,934 --> 0:34:2,573
on what is left
of society.


851
0:34:2,573 --> 0:34:5,175
Bryan: If the Madrid was
to happen today you would


852
0:34:5,175 --> 0:34:7,478
have essentially an
ocean running through


853
0:34:7,478 --> 0:34:9,379
the middle of the
United States that


854
0:34:9,379 --> 0:34:12,316
was probably 100
to 200 miles wide.


855
0:34:12,316 --> 0:34:13,984
Let me show you this.


856
0:34:13,984 --> 0:34:15,686
This right here
is showing the,


857
0:34:15,686 --> 0:34:18,522
what would happen after
a Madrid earthquake.


858
0:34:18,522 --> 0:34:20,958
Louisiana's going to
be underneath water.


859
0:34:20,958 --> 0:34:23,727
So it's gonna
stretch from there,


860
0:34:23,727 --> 0:34:25,429
some of Mississippi's
gonna be underwater.


861
0:34:25,429 --> 0:34:27,97
Arkansas, it's
gonna be cut in,


862
0:34:27,97 --> 0:34:28,265
pretty much in half.


863
0:34:28,265 --> 0:34:30,33
Missouri's got a smaller
path of water going


864
0:34:30,33 --> 0:34:32,402
through it but it goes all
the way up to Illinois.


865
0:34:32,402 --> 0:34:34,4
And up to us.


866
0:34:34,4 --> 0:34:36,14
Lacey: And where do
we sit on this map?


867
0:34:36,14 --> 0:34:38,242
Bryan: We're gonna
be, we're up here.


868
0:34:38,242 --> 0:34:40,77
They're predicting
about 7 million people


869
0:34:40,77 --> 0:34:41,311
will be affected
by this.


870
0:34:41,311 --> 0:34:42,846
Seven million
people panicked,


871
0:34:42,846 --> 0:34:44,414
is not a good thing.


872
0:34:44,414 --> 0:34:46,517
<i> Narrator: Bryan and Lacey

<i> They have income from the

<i> but they currently
 have no savings.</i>

<i> So in order to make more

0:34:59,429 --> 0:35:1,965
<i> they think they'll
 need, Bryan and Lacey</i>


879
0:35:1,965 --> 0:35:6,36
<i> have gone to extremes.</i>


880
0:35:6,36 --> 0:35:8,71
<i> Narrator: Small business
 owners living in Indiana,</i>


881
0:35:8,71 --> 0:35:10,607
<i> Bryan and Lacey may are

<i> of the U.S., tearing
 the country in two.</i>


884
0:35:16,513 --> 0:35:18,182
Bryan: If the Madrid
Fault line was to hit,


885
0:35:18,182 --> 0:35:20,83
we'd have to rethink how
we got our goods across


886
0:35:20,83 --> 0:35:22,786
the United States, because
now we would have a


887
0:35:22,786 --> 0:35:25,422
gigantic mass of
water dividing the


888
0:35:25,422 --> 0:35:26,823
United States.


889
0:35:26,823 --> 0:35:28,759
There's gonna be no way
to truck supplies in


890
0:35:28,759 --> 0:35:30,627
from the Western half
and most of our imports


891
0:35:30,627 --> 0:35:32,229
come from California.


892
0:35:32,229 --> 0:35:34,131
<i> Narrator: Their fears have
 spurred them to try to</i>


893
0:35:34,131 --> 0:35:35,933
<i> fill their home with

0:35:35,933 --> 0:35:39,136
<i> one day ride out the
 end of civilization.</i>


895
0:35:39,136 --> 0:35:42,873
<i> But Bryan and Lacey

896
0:35:42,873 --> 0:35:45,42
Lacey: So how are we
gonna get the things


897
0:35:45,42 --> 0:35:46,543
we don't have?


898
0:35:46,543 --> 0:35:48,679
That we don't
have stocked up?


899
0:35:48,679 --> 0:35:51,381
Bryan: We're gonna need
to barter for items.


900
0:35:51,381 --> 0:35:53,984
I believe bartering
should be done a lot more.


901
0:35:53,984 --> 0:35:57,654
Bartering pretty much
built the world the way we


902
0:35:57,654 --> 0:36:0,724
know it as right now and
then we got sidetracked


903
0:36:0,724 --> 0:36:3,46
with paper money
with no backing.


904
0:36:3,46 --> 0:36:5,462
<i> Narrator: Because he
 believes the dollar is</i>


905
0:36:5,462 --> 0:36:8,31
<i> failing, Bryan converts
 the bulk of his money into</i>


906
0:36:8,31 --> 0:36:11,201
<i> either silver or gold,
 to use for bartering.</i>


907
0:36:11,201 --> 0:36:12,869
Bryan: I mostly
barter with silver.


908
0:36:12,869 --> 0:36:13,971
Sometimes gold.


909
0:36:13,971 --> 0:36:16,273
And I have it in all
denominations from one


910
0:36:16,273 --> 0:36:20,544
gram all the way up
to ten-ounce bars.


911
0:36:20,544 --> 0:36:24,81
Lacey: How much money
do we have in silver?


912
0:36:24,81 --> 0:36:25,649
Bryan: In silver
we're right around


913
0:36:25,649 --> 0:36:28,118
5 or $6,000
give or take.


914
0:36:28,118 --> 0:36:30,487
I won't know exactly
until I weigh it all up


915
0:36:30,487 --> 0:36:32,856
and figure out the
current price.


916
0:36:32,856 --> 0:36:35,492
<i> Narrator: Today most coins
 are made of nickel and</i>


917
0:36:35,492 --> 0:36:40,664
<i> copper, but before 1965
 a quarter was 90% silver.</i>


918
0:36:40,664 --> 0:36:43,33

alright, here's $5.


919
0:36:43,33 --> 0:36:47,4
<i> Narrator: An actual silver
 quarter is worth $5 today.</i>


920
0:36:47,4 --> 0:36:48,372
Bryan: Whenever I
go to the bank and


921
0:36:48,372 --> 0:36:50,307
get my change or through
a drive through,


922
0:36:50,307 --> 0:36:52,242
I always check all my
coins to make sure,


923
0:36:52,242 --> 0:36:53,91
see if any of
it's silver.


924
0:36:53,91 --> 0:36:55,512
<i> Narrator: Bryan has
 been using his silver</i>


925
0:36:55,512 --> 0:36:59,516
<i> stockpile to barter
 for some big preps.</i>


926
0:36:59,516 --> 0:37:1,184
Bryan: I've got
about $700 worth of


927
0:37:1,184 --> 0:37:2,619
solar panels here.


928
0:37:2,619 --> 0:37:5,689
And the trade was about
23 and a half ounces of


929
0:37:5,689 --> 0:37:9,192
silver in trade
for these panels.


930
0:37:9,192 --> 0:37:11,428
If the Madrid Fault
Line was to hit we's


931
0:37:11,428 --> 0:37:14,164
going back in the Stone
Age for most of us.


932
0:37:14,164 --> 0:37:16,266
You'd have to make
power somehow.


933
0:37:16,266 --> 0:37:17,668
We have these
solar panels.


934
0:37:17,668 --> 0:37:19,569
We also have a
wind turbine.


935
0:37:19,569 --> 0:37:21,872
<i> Narrator: Solar and wind
 power are only effective</i>


936
0:37:21,872 --> 0:37:24,608
<i> on sunny and windy days,
 unless you have some way</i>


937
0:37:24,608 --> 0:37:26,843
<i> of storing the
 energy they create.</i>


938
0:37:26,843 --> 0:37:30,147
<i> So Bryan has run wires to
 his basement where he has</i>


939
0:37:30,147 --> 0:37:32,549
<i> ganged together 40
 batteries to store the</i>


940
0:37:32,549 --> 0:37:34,985
<i> excess electricity from
 his solar panels and</i>


941
0:37:34,985 --> 0:37:36,887
<i> wind turbine.</i>


942
0:37:36,887 --> 0:37:38,722
Bryan: We currently
have 40 batteries


943
0:37:38,722 --> 0:37:40,57
wired in parallel.


944
0:37:40,57 --> 0:37:42,359
Each battery's
100 amp hours.


945
0:37:42,359 --> 0:37:45,862
We would be able to live
for maybe two weeks to a


946
0:37:45,862 --> 0:37:48,365
month without any
interruptions if we


947
0:37:48,365 --> 0:37:49,9
had no sun
or wind.


948
0:37:49,9 --> 0:37:51,535
<i> Narrator: In his
 basement safe room,</i>


949
0:37:51,535 --> 0:37:54,838
<i> Bryan also stockpiles
 other items for bartering.</i>


950
0:37:54,838 --> 0:37:57,341
<i> Items like medication
 and alcohol,</i>


951
0:37:57,341 --> 0:37:59,409
<i> which he believes will
 be rare and therefore</i>


952
0:37:59,409 --> 0:38:2,846
<i> valuable after a
 catastrophic earthquake.</i>


953
0:38:2,846 --> 0:38:4,781
Bryan: I believe when
the shelves go empty,


954
0:38:4,781 --> 0:38:7,417
there will be a premium
on alcohol as you will


955
0:38:7,417 --> 0:38:9,619
not be able to
find it anywhere.


956
0:38:9,619 --> 0:38:11,855
I have taken the medicine
from the pet store before


957
0:38:11,855 --> 0:38:14,291
to treat my urinary tract
infections or kidney


958
0:38:14,291 --> 0:38:16,693
infections and they've
worked out excellent.


959
0:38:16,693 --> 0:38:18,261
<i> Narrator: If a New
 Madrid earthquake</i>


960
0:38:18,261 --> 0:38:20,931
<i> one day cuts supply
 lines across America,</i>


961
0:38:20,931 --> 0:38:23,266
<i> Bryan thinks people will
 return to bartering</i>


962
0:38:23,266 --> 0:38:27,671
<i> for the vital
 supplies they need.</i>


963
0:38:27,671 --> 0:38:30,54
<i> But right now, Bryan and
 Lacey need to develop</i>


964
0:38:30,54 --> 0:38:32,909
<i> other sources of income
 in order to be able to</i>


965
0:38:32,909 --> 0:38:35,479
<i> continue prepping
 for doomsday.</i>


966
0:38:35,479 --> 0:38:37,547
<i> So in addition to
 their auto shop,</i>


967
0:38:37,547 --> 0:38:40,751
<i> they breed and sell
 bearded dragons.</i>


968
0:38:40,751 --> 0:38:43,453
Lacey: Bearded dragons,
depending on what color


969
0:38:43,453 --> 0:38:46,556
phase they are,
can sell anywhere


970
0:38:46,556 --> 0:38:50,694
from $25 up to $250.


971
0:38:50,694 --> 0:38:53,597
<i> Narrator: And they
 run an adult website.</i>


972
0:38:53,597 --> 0:38:56,233
Lacey: When Bryan first
came to me with the idea


973
0:38:56,233 --> 0:39:0,871
for an adult website, I
thought it was a good idea


974
0:39:0,871 --> 0:39:4,107
because at the time I had
a friend that was selling


975
0:39:4,107 --> 0:39:6,9
bachelorette accessories
and things like that


976
0:39:6,9 --> 0:39:7,811
and she was making
tons of money.


977
0:39:7,811 --> 0:39:10,8
Everybody's always going
to buy adult toys no


978
0:39:10,8 --> 0:39:11,948
matter what type
of, you know,


979
0:39:11,948 --> 0:39:13,483
what the economy's at.


980
0:39:13,483 --> 0:39:15,152
<i> Narrator: With
 this added income,</i>


981
0:39:15,152 --> 0:39:17,287
<i> Bryan and Lacey have
 turned their basement into</i>


982
0:39:17,287 --> 0:39:20,157
<i> a prepper pantry, stocked
 with enough food to feed a</i>


983
0:39:20,157 --> 0:39:23,427
<i> family of four
 for four years.</i>


984
0:39:23,427 --> 0:39:25,195
Bryan: FEMA says you
should have a three-day


985
0:39:25,195 --> 0:39:26,463
supply of food.


986
0:39:26,463 --> 0:39:29,32
We got over 1,400
days of food.


987
0:39:29,32 --> 0:39:31,635
On all our preps combined
I would say we probably


988
0:39:31,635 --> 0:39:35,639
have spent $60,000
to $75,000.


989
0:39:35,639 --> 0:39:37,674
Any amount of
money is important,


990
0:39:37,674 --> 0:39:39,242
no matter what
the amount is,


991
0:39:39,242 --> 0:39:41,812
but for feeling
safe and secure,


992
0:39:41,812 --> 0:39:43,713
you cannot put
a price on that.


993
0:39:43,713 --> 0:39:45,816
<i> Narrator: Bryan and
 Lacey are confident their</i>


994
0:39:45,816 --> 0:39:48,685
<i> extensive home preps will
 allow them to survive the</i>


995
0:39:48,685 --> 0:39:50,821
<i> initial aftermath
 of a catastrophic</i>


996
0:39:50,821 --> 0:39:52,456
<i> New Madrid earthquake.</i>


997
0:39:52,456 --> 0:39:55,659
<i> But they also believe
 these same preps will make</i>


998
0:39:55,659 --> 0:39:57,861
<i> them prime targets for
 the millions of people</i>


999
0:39:57,861 --> 0:39:59,696
<i> expected to be displaced.</i>


1000
0:39:59,696 --> 0:40:2,966
<i> So Bryan has something
 much bigger in mind,</i>


1001
0:40:2,966 --> 0:40:5,101
<i> something he believes
 could mean the difference</i>


1002
0:40:5,101 --> 0:40:7,571
<i> between life and death.</i>


1003
0:40:7,571 --> 0:40:10,24
<i> Convincing its owner to
 part with it, however,</i>


1004
0:40:10,24 --> 0:40:13,343
<i> might be a tougher
 sell than usual.</i>


1005
0:40:13,343 --> 0:40:15,479
Dave: With delivery
it's $2,900.


1006
0:40:15,479 --> 0:40:16,646
Bryan: That
sounds good.


1007
0:40:16,646 --> 0:40:23,72
Are you willing to
take any barter?


1008
0:40:23,72 --> 0:40:25,889
<i> Narrator: Bryan and Lacey
 may are preparing for a</i>


1009
0:40:25,889 --> 0:40:28,658
<i> major earthquake along the
 New Madrid fault line in</i>


1010
0:40:28,658 --> 0:40:31,261
<i> the central U.S., which
 they believe will cause</i>


1011
0:40:31,261 --> 0:40:33,263
<i> major flooding
 in the heartland,</i>


1012
0:40:33,263 --> 0:40:36,32
<i> displacing several
 million people.</i>


1013
0:40:36,32 --> 0:40:38,468
<i> They've spent
 more than $60,000</i>


1014
0:40:38,468 --> 0:40:42,5
<i> making their suburban
 home self-sufficient,</i>


1015
0:40:42,5 --> 0:40:44,7
<i> but they're worried their
 security cameras and</i>


1016
0:40:44,7 --> 0:40:46,42
<i> arsenal won't be enough
 to protect them from the</i>


1017
0:40:46,42 --> 0:40:48,545
<i> millions of refugees
 they fear will come</i>


1018
0:40:48,545 --> 0:40:51,147
<i> knocking after the
 earthquake strikes.</i>


1019
0:40:51,147 --> 0:40:53,25
<i> So Bryan and Lacey's
 current number one</i>


1020
0:40:53,25 --> 0:40:55,752
<i> priority is to
 establish a secure,</i>


1021
0:40:55,752 --> 0:40:58,255
<i> secret bug-out
 location.</i>


1022
0:40:58,255 --> 0:41:0,123
Lacey: We've thought
about getting a shipping


1023
0:41:0,123 --> 0:41:4,628
container to actually
bury in our backyard.


1024
0:41:4,628 --> 0:41:6,463
Bryan: A shipping
container would be great


1025
0:41:6,463 --> 0:41:8,231
because it would be hidden
underneath the ground.


1026
0:41:8,231 --> 0:41:11,201
So therefore we could
basically bug-out


1027
0:41:11,201 --> 0:41:12,502
and not be seen.


1028
0:41:12,502 --> 0:41:15,105
Bryan: So you want to dig
about a nine-foot hole and


1029
0:41:15,105 --> 0:41:17,607
connect it through either
a basement or a sub-floor


1030
0:41:17,607 --> 0:41:20,744
and have one or more ways
to get in or out of it.


1031
0:41:20,744 --> 0:41:23,113
<i> Narrator: Using shipping
 containers as shelters and</i>


1032
0:41:23,113 --> 0:41:27,45
<i> emergency housing is
 a growing industry.</i>


1033
0:41:27,45 --> 0:41:29,52
<i> In the event of
 an earthquake,</i>


1034
0:41:29,52 --> 0:41:32,322
<i> a shipping container
 is 100 times stronger</i>


1035
0:41:32,322 --> 0:41:37,527
<i> than a conventionally
 designed home.</i>


1036
0:41:37,527 --> 0:41:38,728
Dave: It's all
been repainted.


1037
0:41:38,728 --> 0:41:40,897
It's basically
rust free.


1038
0:41:40,897 --> 0:41:42,399
It's got some
added vents.


1039
0:41:42,399 --> 0:41:43,6
Bryan: Wow.


1040
0:41:43,6 --> 0:41:44,768
Dave: Hardwood
floors.


1041
0:41:44,768 --> 0:41:45,869
Bryan: Boy.


1042
0:41:45,869 --> 0:41:47,237
That's great.


1043
0:41:47,237 --> 0:41:49,306
Dave: With the
delivery it's $2,900.


1044
0:41:49,306 --> 0:41:50,84
Bryan: Do you want
to do any bartering?


1045
0:41:50,84 --> 0:41:52,609
Dave: I'm open to
whatever you got in mind.


1046
0:41:52,609 --> 0:41:54,144
What are you thinkin'?


1047
0:41:54,144 --> 0:41:55,979
Bryan: Well, I've
got my older bug-out


1048
0:41:55,979 --> 0:41:57,981
vehicle and then I
also have some gold.


1049
0:41:57,981 --> 0:41:59,583
Dave: Bug-out vehicle?


1050
0:41:59,583 --> 0:42:1,51
What does that mean?


1051
0:42:1,51 --> 0:42:2,919
Bryan: Well, a bug-out
vehicle is a vehicle that


1052
0:42:2,919 --> 0:42:4,988
you would get out of
Dodge with per se.


1053
0:42:4,988 --> 0:42:7,457
You know, something
that's 4x4, you know,


1054
0:42:7,457 --> 0:42:9,259
something not low
to the ground.


1055
0:42:9,259 --> 0:42:10,327
Dave: Can we take
a look at it?


1056
0:42:10,327 --> 0:42:11,261
Bryan: Yes we can.


1057
0:42:11,261 --> 0:42:13,463
It's an older
Explorer, but you know,


1058
0:42:13,463 --> 0:42:16,32
I figure worth a
couple grand in barter.


1059
0:42:16,32 --> 0:42:18,168
Dave: Okay, I might want
to hear it run and take it


1060
0:42:18,168 --> 0:42:19,769
for a ride, but
I'm interested.


1061
0:42:19,769 --> 0:42:21,404
And then you're going
to add some gold?


1062
0:42:21,404 --> 0:42:23,239
Bryan: Yes, we are.


1063
0:42:23,239 --> 0:42:26,276
These are 24-carat
gold, one-gram bars.


1064
0:42:26,276 --> 0:42:27,711
Each one of them
at current value


1065
0:42:27,711 --> 0:42:30,46
is about $50 apiece.


1066
0:42:30,46 --> 0:42:34,284
So we need, you know,
enough to cover 900 or so.


1067
0:42:34,284 --> 0:42:35,619
There's the last one.


1068
0:42:35,619 --> 0:42:36,486
Dave: Perfect.


1069
0:42:36,486 --> 0:42:38,154
It's like a credit
card but it's.


1070
0:42:38,154 --> 0:42:41,91
Bryan: Good anywhere,
anywhere will take it.


1071
0:42:41,91 --> 0:42:42,225
Dave: Anywhere,
any time.


1072
0:42:42,225 --> 0:42:43,46
Bryan: Exactly.


1073
0:42:43,46 --> 0:42:45,629
If people don't
prep on their own,


1074
0:42:45,629 --> 0:42:48,98
when the time comes, the
government does not have


1075
0:42:48,98 --> 0:42:51,668
the resources out there
to help everybody.


1076
0:42:51,668 --> 0:42:53,737
That was proven
in Katrina.


1077
0:42:53,737 --> 0:42:56,106
They basically put
everybody in a stadium


1078
0:42:56,106 --> 0:42:57,507
and left 'em.


1079
0:42:57,507 --> 0:42:59,676
That kind of proves
when something that big


1080
0:42:59,676 --> 0:43:1,111
and overwhelming happens,


1081
0:43:1,111 --> 0:43:5,849
that you're pretty
much on your own.


1082
0:43:5,849 --> 0:43:7,417
<i> Narrator: Bryan,

<i> We recommend investing
 in a HAM radio.</i>


1088
0:43:18,795 --> 0:43:20,63
Bryan: That is
something we've already


1089
0:43:20,63 --> 0:43:21,431
been looking into
buying already.


1090
0:43:21,431 --> 0:43:23,433
We're also trying to
figure out ways to do


1091
0:43:23,433 --> 0:43:24,734
other means of
communication other


1092
0:43:24,734 --> 0:43:26,36
than HAM as well.

1098
0:43:37,313 --> 0:43:38,648
Bryan: And that is
something that we thought


1099
0:43:38,648 --> 0:43:42,786
about and we are
going to be doing.

Bryan: I can live with
that assessment, um,


1113
0:44:24,527 --> 0:44:29,132
there's always room
for improvement.

Since National
Geographic was here,


1115
0:44:31,468 --> 0:44:34,104
we've started breeding
more and more dragons.


1116
0:44:34,104 --> 0:44:37,54
We've produced hundreds
of babies since the show.


1117
0:44:37,54 --> 0:44:40,9
We also have done
enhancements to


1118
0:44:40,9 --> 0:44:41,644
our rain
catchment system.


1119
0:44:41,644 --> 0:44:44,581
Also, we've started a few
websites for preparations


1120
0:44:44,581 --> 0:44:46,783
to sell different kinds
of preparation products.


1121
0:44:46,783 --> 0:44:51,921
Thank you.
