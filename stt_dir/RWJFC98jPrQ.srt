0:0:20,38 --> 0:0:22,25
you enter Gaza from.


6

After the Egyptian Revolution,

The drive from the border town
of Rafah in the south to Gaza

it's a crucial part of

Hamas, a group that the US and


78
0:3:57,36 --> 0:4:0,96
Europe classify as a terrorist
organization, won.


79
0:4:0,96 --> 0:4:3,46
The Bush administration, who
had championed elections in


80
0:4:3,46 --> 0:4:5,65

obviously less than


81
0:4:5,65 --> 0:4:7,16
thrilled with this outcome.

84
0:4:10,66 --> 0:4:13,68
In addition to helping impose a
blockade that cut off Hamas


85
0:4:13,68 --> 0:4:16,75
from the outside world, they
equipped Hamas's rivals,


86
0:4:16,75 --> 0:4:19,779

weapons and training in hopes


87
0:4:19,779 --> 0:4:21,99

In the days before we arrived,

responded by launching
attacks on what they


98

against Israel is part of the

so when a militant group

After the 2007 battle with rival

It's not easy to have your

If the security of Hamas came to
any restaurant, any opening


165
0:9:59,41 --> 0:10:3,44

sitting together, they


166

Sometimes I feel that they

But at least they are

173
0:10:23,37 --> 0:10:25,33
SUROOSH ALVI: Hamas viewed
the Fatah-run Palestinian


174
0:10:25,33 --> 0:10:28,9
Authority in the West Bank as
an inherently corrupt entity


175
0:10:28,9 --> 0:10:32,75
that failed to provide basic
services for Gazans and looked


176
0:10:32,75 --> 0:10:35,11
the other way when it came
to alcohol and drugs.


177
0:10:35,11 --> 0:10:37,91
Much of Hamas's popularity comes
from the fact that they


178
0:10:37,91 --> 0:10:40,31
are seen as honest and
incorruptible.


179
0:10:40,31 --> 0:10:43,9
And when they took power, they
put a concerted effort into


180
0:10:43,9 --> 0:10:46,2
stomping out all forms
of vice in Gaza.


181
0:10:46,2 --> 0:10:48,79
But the same tunnels that allow
Hamas to smuggle in


182
0:10:48,79 --> 0:10:53,72
weapons from Egypt also allow
for a steady flow of drugs.


183
0:10:53,72 --> 0:10:56,54
SAMAH AHMED: They're children
working in the tunnel.


184
0:10:56,54 --> 0:10:58,58
They are 12, 13.


185
0:10:58,58 --> 0:11:1,16
They are smoking and
taking drugs.


186
0:11:1,16 --> 0:11:4,77
Through the tunnels, many kind
of drugs can enter to Gaza,


187
0:11:4,77 --> 0:11:7,84
because there is no control
on the tunnels.

we figured a park is
a good place to go.

they can do that is through

reminder of the strength of

0:23:51,62 --> 0:23:53,7
Israel's military.

Now that we were all completely
paranoid, we headed

off into the desert with our
truck full of bombs.

ordnance.

taking a lot of precautions,

up without someone
