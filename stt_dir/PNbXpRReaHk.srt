1
0:0:0,6 --> 0:0:5,13
that houses recently approved uh... a
last minute addition to the agricultural


2
0:0:5,13 --> 0:0:9,23
appropriations bill that would basically
protect monsanto


3
0:0:9,23 --> 0:0:13,89
from litigation if there's any evidence
indicating that she and most cause any


4
0:0:13,89 --> 0:0:18,76
type of health or seen health hazards
uh... which is completely disasters


5
0:0:18,76 --> 0:0:21,949
before you comment and jump inject let
me tell you how this was done


6
0:0:21,949 --> 0:0:24,19
first of all it was proposed by


7
0:0:24,19 --> 0:0:27,179
and an honest member of the house we
don't know what is which is super


8
0:0:27,179 --> 0:0:28,109
questionable


9
0:0:28,109 --> 0:0:28,9
so


10
0:0:28,9 --> 0:0:30,859
this is as usual


11
0:0:30,859 --> 0:0:33,82
uh... politics as usual where they
justice


12
0:0:33,82 --> 0:0:35,719
like out there must have felt what


13
0:0:35,719 --> 0:0:37,29
deal would you like


14
0:0:37,29 --> 0:0:41,19
oclc debate we don't know if that's the
day stating that they would only go to


15
0:0:41,19 --> 0:0:43,53
judiciary committee or any other gotten
and committee


16
0:0:43,53 --> 0:0:46,55
and by the way who ask for this


17
0:0:46,55 --> 0:0:50,28
it's not republicans the democrats are
in charge the senate and it seems that


18
0:0:50,28 --> 0:0:52,5
id originally


19
0:0:52,5 --> 0:0:55,74
that idea came from the senate obviously
both the house and senate have to agree


20
0:0:55,74 --> 0:1:0,8
to it by president obama has assigned it
anne got put in into a uh... budget deal


21
0:1:0,8 --> 0:1:2,22
that have to pass


22
0:1:2,22 --> 0:1:4,17
so this is what the intrepid


23
0:1:4,17 --> 0:1:8,46
the budget deal has to pass some corrupt
politician which they're all corrupt


24
0:1:8,46 --> 0:1:10,8
almost all corrupt right


25
0:1:10,8 --> 0:1:11,22
says ok gut


26
0:1:11,22 --> 0:1:15,36
i'm a sneak this into the bill ok
answers the bill passed the past they


27
0:1:15,36 --> 0:1:16,82
have to vote for haha


28
0:1:16,82 --> 0:1:18,909
and is no debate


29
0:1:18,909 --> 0:1:20,45
if the president


30
0:1:20,45 --> 0:1:24,9
didn't want that to be in the bill it
would have been in the bell abdullah


31
0:1:24,9 --> 0:1:27,83
spare me like to go to the clintons
moods of the president as though they


32
0:1:27,83 --> 0:1:28,39
did it


33
0:1:28,39 --> 0:1:31,49
not about defeat of the senators and
representatives


34
0:1:31,49 --> 0:1:35,24
listen if you put this in the bill i'm
not on on board board i will be toward


35
0:1:35,24 --> 0:1:38,9
et cetera there's no way it's in the
bill


36
0:1:38,9 --> 0:1:41,789
instead of course has always the mobile
app


37
0:1:41,789 --> 0:1:43,79
and the corporates democrats alike


38
0:1:43,79 --> 0:1:45,76
yaz hardly a plaza


39
0:1:45,76 --> 0:1:49,15
appointed all i think you should think
about how we became worse that it is so


40
0:1:49,15 --> 0:1:52,53
someone and they didn't know what
they're completely blown


41
0:1:52,53 --> 0:1:57,21
one of the poison dart group unless
needed but wanted boxes so i really do


42
0:1:57,21 --> 0:1:57,799
you mean


43
0:1:57,799 --> 0:2:2,68
get out of jail free car and some sick
of the got a job regards the bankers get


44
0:2:2,68 --> 0:2:6,3
one now these but you know companies
that are doing genetically modified


45
0:2:6,3 --> 0:2:10,789
foods gets a j get out of jail free cart
you've got in trouble they had a


46
0:2:10,789 --> 0:2:11,739
breakdown that


47
0:2:11,739 --> 0:2:12,839
ever on you


48
0:2:12,839 --> 0:2:16,169
local aberystwyth below what i have a
step in shorts


49
0:2:16,169 --> 0:2:20,209
also useful for two thousand rides and
other daughter does another time within


50
0:2:20,209 --> 0:2:25,609
the who served on the efforts so what
blood centers monsanto behave screw up


51
0:2:25,609 --> 0:2:28,369
our entire food supply


52
0:2:28,369 --> 0:2:31,689
who cares you know a lot of reading the
court


53
0:2:31,689 --> 0:2:35,119
but look i daresay monsanto dead and you
have to understand these companies they


54
0:2:35,119 --> 0:2:38,999
do a good as well as back right you know
they've increased


55
0:2:38,999 --> 0:2:43,99
it they've got plenty of increasing the
food supply cetera now of course the


56
0:2:43,99 --> 0:2:46,829
downside of mass until and other
companies in the field


57
0:2:46,829 --> 0:2:51,649
is many for the we've done many stories
about that determination of the farmers


58
0:2:51,649 --> 0:2:53,8
you know and then getting this involving


59
0:2:53,8 --> 0:2:56,949
and other crops that might cause birla
probs


60
0:2:56,949 --> 0:3:0,109
putting that aside what do you agree or
disagree opined that outrageous or the


61
0:3:0,109 --> 0:3:5,489
balance of how you but look at all those
factors you can upgrade with a lot of


62
0:3:5,489 --> 0:3:7,699
says know what has occurred


63
0:3:7,699 --> 0:3:10,4
yes and i think that that's the
important thing to keep in mind here a


64
0:3:10,4 --> 0:3:12,84
lot of times when it comes to you any
issue


65
0:3:12,84 --> 0:3:16,739
uh... involving monsanto if monsanto
gets a pass at something people will be


66
0:3:16,739 --> 0:3:20,23
like don't criticize anything anti
science but it didn't work this has


67
0:3:20,23 --> 0:3:21,829
nothing to do with science


68
0:3:21,829 --> 0:3:25,23
this has to do with consumer protections
this has to do with


69
0:3:25,23 --> 0:3:29,499
you know making sure that you know that
these uh... the behavior of monsanto


70
0:3:29,499 --> 0:3:33,189
isn't impacting the environment and
negative way and i love that you mention


71
0:3:33,189 --> 0:3:36,54
that there are signs and downsized
monsanto of course they're creating


72
0:3:36,54 --> 0:3:41,159
genetically modified crops beckett
withstand a hot climate change and the


73
0:3:41,159 --> 0:3:44,819
horrible things that were already doing
to the environment but at the same time


74
0:3:44,819 --> 0:3:48,669
no peer reviewed studies indicating that
g_m_ also are one hundred percent say


75
0:3:48,669 --> 0:3:51,599
i know that at this point it's
conventional wisdom alex safe don't


76
0:3:51,599 --> 0:3:54,709
worry about it don't worry about it
because i think i like that but support


77
0:3:54,709 --> 0:3:56,79
letters will be pocket just released


78
0:3:56,79 --> 0:4:0,349
and there's no question that we're not
talking about is any way shape or form


79
0:4:0,349 --> 0:4:3,499
once said to have to do this religiously
key way


80
0:4:3,499 --> 0:4:5,189
now if u are


81
0:4:5,189 --> 0:4:10,349
i think you've got a permissive product
why would you get your bride politicians


82
0:4:10,349 --> 0:4:14,49
to make sure they put the law and that
this is you can't be sooo


83
0:4:14,49 --> 0:4:16,939
weicker's you worried about the that
you're gonna get sued what they know


84
0:4:16,939 --> 0:4:21,529
that we don't know if i didn't question
monsanto before which i did i was just a


85
0:4:21,529 --> 0:4:23,879
question of after this one


86
0:4:23,879 --> 0:4:27,419
and by the way how much of the bride
politicians okay so the provision


87
0:4:27,419 --> 0:4:32,58
success is viewed by many as a victory
by companies like as ingenta corporation


88
0:4:32,58 --> 0:4:35,639
cargill uh... monsanto an affiliate tax


89
0:4:35,639 --> 0:4:38,979
they donated seven point five million to
members of congress since two thousand


90
0:4:38,979 --> 0:4:40,59
nine


91
0:4:40,59 --> 0:4:43,21
and three hundred seventy two thousand
two members of stat of the senate


92
0:4:43,21 --> 0:4:45,619
appropriations committee


93
0:4:45,619 --> 0:4:48,929
yes seven half million dollars and they
probably do that i would go into the


94
0:4:48,929 --> 0:4:52,589
hard having nothing to do with molly get
out of jail free card and again i keep


95
0:4:52,589 --> 0:4:54,3
seeing job courses


96
0:4:54,3 --> 0:4:55,35
civil litigation


97
0:4:55,35 --> 0:4:58,31
but it's just term of art area in terms
of


98
0:4:58,31 --> 0:5:1,29
being free of liability and so


99
0:5:1,29 --> 0:5:2,15
i'd


100
0:5:2,15 --> 0:5:8,13
if you thought you know bob was going to
bring you change you're nuts


101
0:5:8,13 --> 0:5:9,569
phone safety czar


102
0:5:9,569 --> 0:5:13,41
the food safety czar is the former top
lobbyist


103
0:5:13,41 --> 0:5:17,18
or monsanto but was he a pot appointed
by it


104
0:5:17,18 --> 0:5:19,349
president frodo block


105
0:5:19,349 --> 0:5:20,439
archaic


106
0:5:20,439 --> 0:5:25,21
guy loves corporations will do anything
for his lobbyist and donor friends


107
0:5:25,21 --> 0:5:30,34
and he lobbied in in in in i'm sorry
argued ford two thousand eight


108
0:5:30,34 --> 0:5:33,69
that he was gonna bring change into the
south dakota washington


109
0:5:33,69 --> 0:5:36,879
where lobbyists and owners got special
deals


110
0:5:36,879 --> 0:5:40,529
does this look like a steel this looks
like the exactly the kind of special


111
0:5:40,529 --> 0:5:41,32
deal


112
0:5:41,32 --> 0:5:43,139
the robot was said he would stop


113
0:5:43,139 --> 0:5:46,59
instead always done instead that process
up


114
0:5:46,59 --> 0:5:48,74
with bob insurance like this


115
0:5:48,74 --> 0:5:52,139
he is a julliard and owner of fraud


116
0:5:52,139 --> 0:5:53,92
so you think that's too strong


117
0:5:53,92 --> 0:5:57,409
sat there for you these are the facts
you don't like the facts


118
0:5:57,409 --> 0:5:58,599
you can't stand the fact


119
0:5:58,599 --> 0:6:0,809
soon but such a nice guy voted former
couple times


120
0:6:0,809 --> 0:6:4,68
this such a lovely smile but i can't dot
he has won a wonderful family has


121
0:6:4,68 --> 0:6:9,8
he told me it was for change he's on my
tv side team democrat notes of fraud


122
0:6:9,8 --> 0:6:12,8
is a politician just like the rest of
them


123
0:6:12,8 --> 0:8:12,8
and he takes that money he doesn't
exactly as he is told
