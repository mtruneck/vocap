1
0:0:0,99 --> 0:0:3,96
COUPLE OF ANNOUNCEMENTS FOR YOU. THE FIRST


2
0:0:3,96 --> 0:0:8,16
ANNOUNCEMENT IS THAT MR. KERN IS GIVING HIS
REVIEW


3
0:0:8,16 --> 0:0:11,75
SESSION TODAY IN 2013, SO FOR THOSE OF YOU
WHO WANT TO


4
0:0:11,75 --> 0:0:13,82
GO TO THE REVIEW SESSION YOU ARE WELCOME TO
DO SO.


5
0:0:13,82 --> 0:0:16,76
MR. KERN WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR YOU. SECOND
IS THAT


6
0:0:16,76 --> 0:0:19,48
THERE IS A HANDOUT WHICH IS A PEANUT. MAKE
SURE ALL


7
0:0:19,48 --> 0:0:22,449
OF YOU HAVE IT. WE WILL BE USING IN THE LECTURE.
FOR


8
0:0:22,449 --> 0:0:24,13
THOSE OF YOU WHO WEREN'T HERE YOU WILL BE
AT


9
0:0:24,13 --> 0:0:27,769
A DISADVANTAGE BECAUSE THE PEANUT MAY BE ON
THE


10
0:0:27,769 --> 0:0:30,96
MIDTERM. SO, THOSE OF YOU WHO LOOK AT IT TODAY
WILL


11
0:0:30,96 --> 0:0:36,83
HAVE A BIT OF AN ADVANTAGE. LAST TIME WHEN
WE ENDED


12
0:0:36,83 --> 0:0:42,91
LECTURE I WAS TALKING TO YOU ABOUT THE ANGIOSPERM.
WE


13
0:0:42,91 --> 0:0:47,47
SAID THAT THE ANGIOSPERMS TURNED OUT TO BE
SUCCESSFUL


14
0:0:47,47 --> 0:0:51,26
 GROUP AND INDEED OF MOST OF THE SEED PLANTS
ARE


15
0:0:51,26 --> 0:0:56,28
ANGIOSPERMS. ABOUT 240 THOUSAND PLANTS ARE


16
0:0:56,28 --> 0:0:58,65
ANGIOSPERMS. THE REASON THEY TURNED OUT TO
BE SUCH


17
0:0:58,65 --> 0:1:1,68
A SUCCESSFUL GROUP IS REALLY FOR A NUMBER
OF REASONS.


18
0:1:1,68 --> 0:1:6,79
FIRST OF ALL THEY DEVELOPED THE FRUIT TO PROTECT
THE


19
0:1:6,79 --> 0:1:12,939
DEVELOPING EMBRYO. AND WE TALKED ABOUT THE
FLOWER


20
0:1:12,939 --> 0:1:16,969
WHICH IS A WAY OF ATTRACTING A POLLINATOR,
AND IN FACT


21
0:1:16,969 --> 0:1:20,3
THAT TAKES US TO REALLY ITS PART OF THE SECOND
AND


22
0:1:20,3 --> 0:1:23,13
THIRD REASON OR ONE IN THE SAME IS WHICH THEY
DEVELOP


23
0:1:23,13 --> 0:1:38,189
A MECHANISM FOR FACILITATED POLLINATION OR
FOR


24
0:1:38,189 --> 0:1:41,6
FACILITATING THE TRANSFER OF POLLEN. THESE
ARE REALLY


25
0:1:41,6 --> 0:1:44,759
IMPORTANT CHARACTERISTICS THAT THE ANGIOSPERMS
HAD AND


26
0:1:44,759 --> 0:1:47,549
THAT IS WHAT MAKES THEM THE DOMINANT PLANTS
OF TODAY'S


27
0:1:47,549 --> 0:1:49,329
EARTH.


28
0:1:49,329 --> 0:1:52,3
TODAY, WHAT I WANT TO DO WITH TODAY'S LECTURE
WE


29
0:1:52,3 --> 0:1:56,429
WILL BEGIN A SERIES OF TALKS OR LECTURES ON
THE GROWTH


30
0:1:56,429 --> 0:1:59,459
AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE ANGIOSPERM PLANT BODY.


31
0:1:59,459 --> 0:2:9,47
WE WILL TALK ABOUT, NOT TODAY, BUT EVENTUALLY
WE


32
0:2:9,47 --> 0:2:12,34
 WILL TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE BIOCHEMISTRY
AND


33
0:2:12,34 --> 0:2:16,26
PHYSIOLOGY WHICH IS INVOLVED IN THE LIFE HISTORY
OF


34
0:2:16,26 --> 0:2:20,73
THESE VERY INTERESTING ORGANISMS. NOW, IN
ORDER FOR


35
0:2:20,73 --> 0:2:24,56
US TO STUDY AND UNDERSTAND BIOCHEMISTRY AND
PHYSIOLOGY


36
0:2:24,56 --> 0:2:27,9
AND TO APPRECIATE IT, WE ALSO HAVE TO KNOW
SOMETHING


37
0:2:27,9 --> 0:2:29,6
ABOUT THE STRUCTURE OF THE PLANT. WHERE DO
THESE


38
0:2:29,6 --> 0:2:31,79
EVENTS OCCUR AND WHAT ARE THE TISSUES AND
CELL TYPES


39
0:2:31,79 --> 0:2:35,6
IN WHICH THE EVENTS OCCUR? WE WILL BE SPENDING
TIME


40
0:2:35,6 --> 0:2:37,56
IN THE NEXT LECTURE TALKING ABOUT THE CELL
AND TISSUE


41
0:2:37,56 --> 0:2:42,17
TYPES AS SORT OF AN OPENING FOR THE PHYSIOLOGY
AND


42
0:2:42,17 --> 0:2:46,24
BIOCHEMICAL EXPERIMENTS I WILL TELL YOU ABOUT.


43
0:2:46,24 --> 0:2:48,9
WHENEVER WE TALK ABOUT GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT
IN


44
0:2:48,9 --> 0:2:51,37
PLANTS ONE OF THE POINTS WHICH UNDERLIES THE


45
0:2:51,37 --> 0:2:53,9
DISCUSSION, AND YOU SHOULD KEEP THIS IN YOUR
MIND THAT


46
0:2:53,9 --> 0:2:58,16
ONCE THE PLANT SENDS DOWN ITS ROOTS AND IT
PUTS ITSELF


47
0:2:58,16 --> 0:3:1,1
IN A PARTICULAR SPOT IT IS THERE FOR THE REST
OF ITS


48
0:3:1,1 --> 0:3:4,73
LIFE. IF THE WEATHER TURNS BAD OR WATER RUNS
LOW OR


49
0:3:4,73 --> 0:3:8,26
IF A TREE GROWS OVER IT THAT PLANT CAN'T GET
UP AND


50
0:3:8,26 --> 0:3:10,7
 LEAVE AND GO SOMEPLACE ELSE WHERE THERE
ARE BETTER


51
0:3:10,7 --> 0:3:14,21
CONDITIONS. IT CAN'T MOVE LIKE AN ANIMAL MOVES.
SO


52
0:3:14,21 --> 0:3:16,4
PLANTS HAVE DEVELOPED MECHANISMS AND WE WILL
TALK


53
0:3:16,4 --> 0:3:19,93
ABOUT MANY OF THEM TO HELP THEM SENSE CHANGES
IN THEIR


54
0:3:19,93 --> 0:3:22,22
ENVIRONMENT AND RESPOND TO CHANGES IN THEIR


55
0:3:22,22 --> 0:3:24,46
ENVIRONMENT. THIS IS REALLY GOING TO BE A
THEME IN


56
0:3:24,46 --> 0:3:27,29
ONE OF OUR TALKS IS HOW DO PLANTS SENSE CHANGES
AND


57
0:3:27,29 --> 0:3:30,52
HOW DO THEY RESPOND. REALIZE THAT A PLANT
IS


58
0:3:30,52 --> 0:3:33,97
EVENTUALLY FIXED OR ROOTED OR TRAPPED WHEREVER
IT


59
0:3:33,97 --> 0:3:38,29
HAPPENS TO PUT DOWN ITS ROOTS. LAST TIME WE
ENDED THE


60
0:3:38,29 --> 0:3:42,86
DISCUSSION BY INTRODUCING YOU TO FERTILIZATION
IN THE


61
0:3:42,86 --> 0:3:46,31
PLANT AND WE SAID FERTILIZATION IN ANGIOSPERM
RESULTED


62
0:3:46,31 --> 0:3:55,85
IN TWO EVENTS. WE HAVE DOUBLE FERTILIZATION,
AND AS


63
0:3:55,85 --> 0:3:58,86
A RESULT OF DOUBLE FERTILIZATION TWO DIFFERENT
TYPES


64
0:3:58,86 --> 0:4:1,36
OF EVENTS OCCURRED. FIRST OF ALL, WE HAD THE


65
0:4:1,36 --> 0:4:8,27
BEGINNING OF THE 2N EMBRYO. THEN, SECONDLY,
WE HAVE


66
0:4:8,27 --> 0:4:15,85
THIS 3N OR TRIPLOID TISSUE WHICH I CALLED
ENDOSPERM.


67
0:4:15,85 --> 0:4:22,29
WE WILL SPEND SOME TIME NOW TALKING ABOUT
BOTH


68
0:4:22,29 --> 0:4:24,27
 OF THESE TISSUES, BOTH OF THESE PRODUCTS
OF DOUBLE


69
0:4:24,27 --> 0:4:30,12
FERTILIZATION AND RETURN TO ENDOSPERM IN A
MOMENT.


70
0:4:30,12 --> 0:4:33,689
LET'S FIRST LOOK AT THE DEVELOPING EMBRYO
AND THEN WE


71
0:4:33,689 --> 0:4:37,8
WILL LOOK AT THE ENDOSPERM.


72
0:4:37,8 --> 0:4:40,2
IN ANGIOSPERMS WHAT WAS NOTICED WHEN PEOPLE


73
0:4:40,2 --> 0:4:44,669
STARTED STUDYING THEM VERY CAREFULLY IS THAT
EMBRYO'S


74
0:4:44,669 --> 0:4:47,18
TENDED TO FALL IN ONE OF TWO GROUPS.


75
0:4:47,18 --> 0:4:49,83
IF YOU LOOKED AT THE MATURE EMBRYO I WILL
DO


76
0:4:49,83 --> 0:4:53,9
A CARTOON HERE, I WILL POINT OUT THE PARTS
THAT ARE


77
0:4:53,9 --> 0:4:58,199
IMPORTANT. IN ONE TYPE OF EMBRYO, THERE SEEMED
TO BE


78
0:4:58,199 --> 0:5:4,21
TWO BUMPS.


79
0:5:4,21 --> 0:5:7,39
AND THESE TWO BUMPS, BECAUSE THEY WERE


80
0:5:7,39 --> 0:5:11,55
PRESENT IN THE EMBRYO, THEY ARE CALLED SEED
LEAVES,


81
0:5:11,55 --> 0:5:15,87
BECAUSE THEY ARE PRESENT IN THE SEED. SEED
LEAVES.


82
0:5:15,87 --> 0:5:22,4
OR THE TECHNICAL TERM THEY ARE CALLED COTYLEDONS.
AND


83
0:5:22,4 --> 0:5:26,24
BECAUSE THEY HAVE TWO BUMPS OR TWO SEED LEAVES
THEY


84
0:5:26,24 --> 0:5:33,62
ARE CALLED DICOTS. TWO COTYLEDONS, OR TWO
LEAVES AND


85
0:5:33,62 --> 0:5:36,539
THE MORE CURRENT TERM NOW, RATHER THAN CALLING
THEM


86
0:5:36,539 --> 0:5:40,449
DICOTS, YOUR BOOK REFERS TO THEM AS EUDICOTS.
BUT,


87
0:5:40,449 --> 0:5:42,789
 YOU WILL STILL FIND ME SLIPPING BACK TO
CALLING THEM


88
0:5:42,789 --> 0:5:47,919
DICOTS. ONE TYPE OF EMBRYO THAT WE FIND WHEN
WE STUDY


89
0:5:47,919 --> 0:5:52,349
THE MATURE SEEDS OF ANGIOSPERMS. THE SECOND
TYPE OF


90
0:5:52,349 --> 0:6:5,379
EMBRYO WHICH WE FIND HAS, AS IT TURNS OUT,
ONE BUMP OR


91
0:6:5,379 --> 0:6:10,539
ONE COTYLEDON. AND PLANTS HAVING THIS TYPE
OF EMBRYO


92
0:6:10,539 --> 0:6:18,189
ARE KNOWN AS MONOCOTS. MONO MEANING ONE. IN
THE


93
0:6:18,189 --> 0:6:23,539
ANGIOSPERMS YOU CAN DIVIDE THE GROUP OF PLANTS,
240


94
0:6:23,539 --> 0:6:27,449
THOUSAND SPECIES, INTO ONE OF TWO SORT OF
SUBGROUPS,


95
0:6:27,449 --> 0:6:32,86
BASED UPON WHAT THE EMBRYO LOOKS LIKE. NOW,
WHAT I


96
0:6:32,86 --> 0:6:39,15
WANT TO SAY IS THAT IN SOME PLANTS, THESE
ARE


97
0:6:39,15 --> 0:6:50,8
USUALLY EUDICOTS. USUALLY EUDICOTS, BUT NOT
ALWAYS.


98
0:6:50,8 --> 0:7:3,159
THE EMBRYO ENLARGES AND ITS COTYLEDONS EVENTUALLY
FILL


99
0:7:3,159 --> 0:7:6,87
THE SEED.


100
0:7:6,87 --> 0:7:11,919
FILL THE SEED. SO, IF YOU COULD IMAGINE SEED


101
0:7:11,919 --> 0:7:18,11
WHICH IS DEVELOPING WHICH HAD ENDOSPERM HERE,
AND


102
0:7:18,11 --> 0:7:25,8
A SMALL EMBRYO HERE. YOU WAITED FOR SOME TIME
IN THIS


103
0:7:25,8 --> 0:7:28,639
EXAMPLE THAT I HAVE GIVEN YOU, WHAT YOU WOULD
HAVE IS


104
0:7:28,639 --> 0:7:30,729
MOST OF THE SEED WOULD BE FILLED WITH THE
EMBRYO.


105
0:7:30,729 --> 0:7:36,46
 THERE WOULD BE VERY LITTLE ENDOSPERM PRESENT.
AND


106
0:7:36,46 --> 0:7:43,839
THIS TENDS TO OCCUR IN THE EUDICOTS. IN THE
MONOCOTS,


107
0:7:43,839 --> 0:7:57,349
IN GENERAL, THE EMBRYO REMAINS SMALL IN THE
MONOCOTS.


108
0:7:57,349 --> 0:8:11,24
MOST OF THE SEED IS FILLED WITH ENDOSPERM.


109
0:8:11,24 --> 0:8:13,55
BUT WHAT I WANT TO SAY NOW, AND WE WILL EXPLORE


110
0:8:13,55 --> 0:8:23,469
THIS STATEMENT IN A FEW MINUTES, THAT BOTH
COTYLEDONS


111
0:8:23,469 --> 0:8:36,709
AND ENDOSPERM PROVIDE NUTRIENTS FOR THE DEVELOPING


112
0:8:36,709 --> 0:8:39,539
SEEDLING. WE WILL EXPLORE THIS STATEMENT A
LITTLE


113
0:8:39,539 --> 0:8:47,589
MORE VERY SHORTLY.


114
0:8:47,589 --> 0:8:51,339
NOW, LET'S LOOK AT THE EMBRYO AXIS WITH THE


115
0:8:51,339 --> 0:8:55,36
COTYLEDONS ATTACHED. AGAIN, WE HAVE TWO TYPES
OF


116
0:8:55,36 --> 0:9:0,959
AXIS. IN THE FIRST TYPE, WE HAVE THE EUDICOT
WITH THE


117
0:9:0,959 --> 0:9:11,6
TWO COTYLEDONS. THIS IS THE EMBRYO AXIS.


118
0:9:11,6 --> 0:9:19,36
HERE IS THE EUDICOT. TWO COTYLEDON ATTACHED.


119
0:9:19,36 --> 0:9:22,449
WE TEND TO GIVE THE NAME TO THE REGION ABOVE
THE


120
0:9:22,449 --> 0:9:24,81
COTYLEDONS AND THE REGION BELOW. AND THE REASON
I


121
0:9:24,81 --> 0:9:27,75
WANT TO GIVE YOU THIS TERMINOLOGY IS, YOU
WILL SEE IT


122
0:9:27,75 --> 0:9:30,779
IN THE LAB AND IT WILL BE IMPORTANT WHEN WE
TALK ABOUT


123
0:9:30,779 --> 0:9:33,57
 HOW THIS SEED GERMINATES, THE REGION ABOVE
THE


124
0:9:33,57 --> 0:9:40,73
COTYLEDONS IS CALLED EPI, FOR BEING ABOVE,
THE


125
0:9:40,73 --> 0:9:45,339
EPICOTYL, EPICOTYL. THE REGION ABOVE WHERE
THE


126
0:9:45,339 --> 0:9:48,82
COTYLEDONS ARE ATTACHED TO THE AXIS. AND THE
REGION


127
0:9:48,82 --> 0:9:54,639
BELOW, HYPO, MEANING BELOW COTYL. THE REGION
BELOW THE


128
0:9:54,639 --> 0:9:59,759
AXIS. IF WE LOOK AT A MONOCOT, WHICH HAS ONLY
ONE


129
0:9:59,759 --> 0:10:4,5
COTYLEDON, WE WOULD HAVE THE SINGLE COTYLEDON
AND WE


130
0:10:4,5 --> 0:10:9,17
WOULD HAVE EXACTLY THOSE SAME REGIONS, THE
EPI AND THE


131
0:10:9,17 --> 0:10:15,31
HYPO. NOW, THIS NEXT COUPLE OF MINUTES, WHAT
I AM


132
0:10:15,31 --> 0:10:17,6
GOING TO TELL YOU, IS PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT


133
0:10:17,6 --> 0:10:20,4
POINT OR THE HARDEST POINT OF TODAY'S LECTURE,
BECAUSE


134
0:10:20,4 --> 0:10:22,75
WE WILL BE REFERRING BACK TO IT AS WE GO FURTHER
INTO


135
0:10:22,75 --> 0:10:29,529
THE CLASS. I WILL WRITE THIS DOWN FOR YOU.
AT EITHER


136
0:10:29,529 --> 0:10:41,87
OF END OF THE AXIS ARE ZONES OF HIGH CELL
DIVISION


137
0:10:41,87 --> 0:10:47,69
ACTIVITY.


138
0:10:47,69 --> 0:10:50,37
WE CALL THESE ZONES OF HIGH CELL DIVISION


139
0:10:50,37 --> 0:10:55,779
ACTIVITY, MERISTEMS.


140
0:10:55,779 --> 0:11:3,649
SO, AT THIS END HERE WE HAVE A MERISTEM, BECAUSE


141
0:11:3,649 --> 0:11:15,449
IT IS AT THE TOP, IT IS THE SHOOT MERISTEM.
 AT THIS END HERE WE ALSO HAVE A MERISTEM.


142
0:11:15,449 --> 0:11:18,43
BECAUSE IT IS AT THE BOTTOM, WE CALL IT THE
ROOT


143
0:11:18,43 --> 0:11:20,97
MERISTEM.


144
0:11:20,97 --> 0:11:26,449
NOW, WHY ARE THESE ZONES SO IMPORTANT?


145
0:11:26,449 --> 0:11:35,56
THROUGH THEIR ACTIVITY,


146
0:11:35,56 --> 0:11:36,699
NEW CELLS ARE PRODUCED


147
0:11:36,699 --> 0:11:42,959
IN THE AXIS.


148
0:11:42,959 --> 0:11:45,81
ARE PRODUCED.


149
0:11:45,81 --> 0:11:48,48
NEW CELLS PRODUCED. SO WE HAVE THESE ZONES
OF


150
0:11:48,48 --> 0:11:51,759
HIGH CELL DIVISION ACTIVITY. THE SHOOT MERISTEM
AND


151
0:11:51,759 --> 0:11:54,949
THE ROOT MERISTEM. THEY DIVIDE AND WHAT I
AM SAYING


152
0:11:54,949 --> 0:11:58,17
IS THROUGH THOSE DIVISION ACTIVITIES WE PRODUCE
MANY


153
0:11:58,17 --> 0:12:1,259
NEW CELLS.


154
0:12:1,259 --> 0:12:7,629
IF A CELL OR TISSUE, THIS IS THE HARD PART.


155
0:12:7,629 --> 0:12:21,259
CELL OR TISSUE CAN BE TRACED BACK IN ITS ORIGIN,
TO


156
0:12:21,259 --> 0:12:27,139
THE MERISTEM, THAT IS, IF A CELL OR TISSUE
ORIGINATED


157
0:12:27,139 --> 0:12:38,37
AT A MERISTEM WE CALL THIS CELL OR TISSUE,
PRIMARY.


158
0:12:38,37 --> 0:12:43,19
CALL IT PRIMARY. WE HAVE THE FIRST CATEGORY
OF CELL


159
0:12:43,19 --> 0:12:45,49
TYPES I WANT TO INTRODUCE YOU TO OR TISSUE
TYPES,


160
0:12:45,49 --> 0:12:49,23
WHICH WE CALL PRIMARY. WE CALL THEM PRIMARY,
BECAUSE


161
0:12:49,23 --> 0:12:53,89
 THEIR ORIGIN IS AS A RESULT OF CELL DIVISION
OR


162
0:12:53,89 --> 0:12:56,81
MEITOTIC ACTIVITY AT EITHER THE ROOT MERISTEM
OR SHOOT


163
0:12:56,81 --> 0:12:59,74
MERISTEM. THIS IS IMPORTANT POINT AND I WANT
YOU TO


164
0:12:59,74 --> 0:13:5,449
MAKE SURE YOU ALL UNDERSTAND THIS. OKAY, NOW,
WHAT I


165
0:13:5,449 --> 0:13:10,29
WANT TO DO IS TO EXPLORE THE SECOND TISSUE,
WHICH WAS


166
0:13:10,29 --> 0:13:17,69
IN THE EMBRYO, NAMELY THE ENDOSPERM.


167
0:13:17,69 --> 0:13:21,56
WE SAID THE ENDOSPERM IS 3N OR TRIPLOID. ALL
OF


168
0:13:21,56 --> 0:13:24,389
YOU, MAYBE THERE IS A RARE EXCEPTION HERE
IN THIS


169
0:13:24,389 --> 0:13:27,259
ROOM, BUT ALL OF YOU HAVE INTIMATE EXPERIENCE
IN YOUR


170
0:13:27,259 --> 0:13:33,47
LIVES WITH ENDOSPERM. WHENEVER YOU EAT CORN
AND YOU


171
0:13:33,47 --> 0:13:37,9
BITE INTO A EAR OF CORN WHICH MAY COME FROM,
NOT FROM


172
0:13:37,9 --> 0:13:39,8
SAFEWAY, BUT MIGHT COME FROM, LET'S SAY ANDRONICO'S
OR


173
0:13:39,8 --> 0:13:42,54
BERKELEY BOWL OR MONTEREY MARKET. WHEN YOU
BITE INTO


174
0:13:42,54 --> 0:13:46,199
A CORN KERNEL AND YOU HAVE LIQUID WHICH SQUIRTS
ON TO


175
0:13:46,199 --> 0:13:49,129
YOUR FACE WHEN YOU BITE INTO A CORN KERNEL,
THAT


176
0:13:49,129 --> 0:13:51,99
LIQUID, WHICH IS SQUIRTING ON TO YOUR FACE,
IS LIQUID


177
0:13:51,99 --> 0:13:56,709
ENDOSPERM. THAT MATERIAL IS NUTRIENT MATERIAL
THAT WE


178
0:13:56,709 --> 0:14:0,569
LIKE WHICH IS SWEET AND PROVIDES THE NUTRITION
FOR THE


179
0:14:0,569 --> 0:14:3,68
 DEVELOPING SEEDLING HERE. NOW, WHEN THIS
EAR OF CORN


180
0:14:3,68 --> 0:14:7,209
IS PRODUCED ON THE CORN PLANT AND IT IS FIRST


181
0:14:7,209 --> 0:14:11,56
PRODUCED, THE LIQUID ENDOSPERM IS SWEET. LET'S
ASSUME


182
0:14:11,56 --> 0:14:13,949
THIS EAR FALLS TO THE GROUND AND FOR SOME
REASON IT


183
0:14:13,949 --> 0:14:16,87
WASN'T HARVESTED JUST LAID ON THE GROUND.
WHAT


184
0:14:16,87 --> 0:14:19,949
NORMALLY HAPPENS IN NATURE IS THIS EAR FALLS
TO THE


185
0:14:19,949 --> 0:14:22,339
GROUND, IF IT IS NOT PICKED OR EATEN BY AN
ANIMAL, THE


186
0:14:22,339 --> 0:14:25,87
LIQUID ENDOSPERM TURNS TO STARCH. THIS IS
WHAT


187
0:14:25,87 --> 0:14:28,6
HAPPENS IN SAFEWAY WHEN THEY LET IT SIT ON
THE SHELF


188
0:14:28,6 --> 0:14:31,11
WITHOUT BEING REFRIGERATED. THE LIQUID ENDOSPERM


189
0:14:31,11 --> 0:14:35,67
TURNS TO STARCH AND LOSES SWEETNESS. IN NATURE,
THE


190
0:14:35,67 --> 0:14:38,87
EAR REMAINS ON THE GROUND IN A STATE OF STARCHINESS


191
0:14:38,87 --> 0:14:42,339
THROUGHOUT THE WINTER, AND THEN WHEN SPRING
COMES THAT


192
0:14:42,339 --> 0:14:45,769
STARCH IS CONVERTED BACK TO SUGAR AGAIN. AND
IS USED


193
0:14:45,769 --> 0:14:48,98
BY THE DEVELOPING SEEDLING. MY QUESTION TO
YOU,


194
0:14:48,98 --> 0:14:51,72
ANOTHER QUESTION WHICH I WANT TO ADDRESS IS
WHY GO


195
0:14:51,72 --> 0:14:56,23
THROUGH THE PROCESS OF SUGAR TO STARCH TO
SUGAR WHICH


196
0:14:56,23 --> 0:14:58,98
IS A BIO-CHEMICALLY, VERY EXPENSIVE PROCESS
WHERE IT


197
0:14:58,98 --> 0:15:1,61
 INVOLVES QUITE A BIT OF ENERGY, IF YOU ARE
STARTING


198
0:15:1,61 --> 0:15:4,37
WITH SUGAR AND ENDING WITH SUGAR. WHY GO THROUGH
THIS


199
0:15:4,37 --> 0:15:6,879
MIDDLE PHASE OF STARCH. QUESTION THAT I WOULD
LIKE


200
0:15:6,879 --> 0:15:10,639
YOU TO THINK ABOUT. ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF LIQUID


201
0:15:10,639 --> 0:15:12,959
ENDOSPERM THAT MANY OF YOU ESPECIALLY THOSE
OF YOU


202
0:15:12,959 --> 0:15:15,459
FROM EAST ASIAN CULTURES ARE FAMILIAR WITH
IS COCONUT


203
0:15:15,459 --> 0:15:20,459
MILK. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN HEAR. THIS IS
COCONUT


204
0:15:20,459 --> 0:15:24,529
MILK YOU CAN BUY IN THE STORE. COCONUT MILK
IS LIQUID


205
0:15:24,529 --> 0:15:29,93
ENDOSPERM. THIS IS MATERIAL WHICH THE COCONUT
PLANT


206
0:15:29,93 --> 0:15:34,519
DEVELOPS AND PUTS ASIDE FOR THE NOURISHMENT
OF THE


207
0:15:34,519 --> 0:15:37,93
YOUNG COCONUT SEEDLING, UNTIL IT GETS ESTABLISHED
AND


208
0:15:37,93 --> 0:15:41,629
CAN PHOTOSYNTHESIZE. IT IS A VERY RICH COMPOUND,
VERY


209
0:15:41,629 --> 0:15:44,579
RICH IN COMPOUNDS AND NEVER HAS BEEN FULLY
ANALYZED


210
0:15:44,579 --> 0:15:47,92
BUT AS YOU MIGHT GUESS IT CONTAINS EVERYTHING,


211
0:15:47,92 --> 0:15:51,17
INCLUDING AMINO ACIDS THAT THE YOUNG SEEDLING
NEEDS TO


212
0:15:51,17 --> 0:15:53,959
GET GOING. SO, IF WE TOOK A YOUNG COCONUT,
WHICH I


213
0:15:53,959 --> 0:15:57,18
HAVE SOME EXAMPLES HERE, IF I MADE A CUT DOWN
THE


214
0:15:57,18 --> 0:15:59,99
MIDDLE OF THE COCONUT WHAT WE WOULD SEE IS
THE


215
0:15:59,99 --> 0:16:5,899
 FOLLOWING? HERE IS A COCONUT CUT DOWN THE
MIDDLE.


216
0:16:5,899 --> 0:16:10,73
AT ONE END OF THE COCONUT IS THE EMBRYO. ONE
END OF


217
0:16:10,73 --> 0:16:14,209
THE COCONUT IS THE EMBRYO. THE REST OF THE
COCONUT IS


218
0:16:14,209 --> 0:16:21,999
THE ENDOSPERM. IT IS LIQUID ENDOSPERM. NOW
AS THIS


219
0:16:21,999 --> 0:16:27,24
EMBRYO MATURES AND STARTING TO GROW, WHAT
YOU FIND


220
0:16:27,24 --> 0:16:31,439
HAPPENING AND WHAT MOST OF YOU ARE EXPERIENCED
WITH IS


221
0:16:31,439 --> 0:16:36,449
THAT THERE IS WHITE TISSUE, WHICH IS WHAT
YOU EAT WHEN


222
0:16:36,449 --> 0:16:42,639
YOU HAVE COCONUT. THIS WHITE TISSUE ALONG
THE OUTSIDE


223
0:16:42,639 --> 0:16:47,1
OR THE PERIMETER OF THE COCONUT. THIS WHITE
TISSUE IS


224
0:16:47,1 --> 0:16:56,889
CELLULARIZED ENDOSPERM. THAT IS, EACH OF THESE
3N


225
0:16:56,889 --> 0:17:0,87
NUCLEI, OF WHICH THERE ARE MILLIONS, MILLIONS
OF THEM,


226
0:17:0,87 --> 0:17:6,309
HAVE NOW BEGUN TO PARTITION INTO INDIVIDUAL
CELLS SO


227
0:17:6,309 --> 0:17:10,839
THAT IF YOU CUT THROUGH A MATURE COCONUT WHICH
IS JUST


228
0:17:10,839 --> 0:17:14,289
STARTING TO GERMINATE THERE WOULD NO LONGER
BE LIQUID


229
0:17:14,289 --> 0:17:17,909
ALL OF THE ENDOSPERM WOULD BE CELLULARIZED.
I HAVE


230
0:17:17,909 --> 0:17:22,819
HERE A COCONUT WHICH HAS BEEN CUT DOWN THE
MIDDLE,


231
0:17:22,819 --> 0:17:24,949
THIS COCONUT HAS BEEN CUT DOWN THE MIDDLE
WE JUST


232
0:17:24,949 --> 0:17:28,83
DON'T HAVE THE COCONUT, WE HAVE THE FRUIT.
YOU ARE


233
0:17:28,83 --> 0:17:33,299
 LOOKING AT A SEED AND PART OF THE FRUIT
WALL. THIS IS


234
0:17:33,299 --> 0:17:35,39
THE OTHER PART OF THE FRUIT WALL, WHICH WE
HAVE OVER


235
0:17:35,39 --> 0:17:40,49
HERE. THIS FRUIT WALL HAS A SPECIAL PURPOSE,
BUT FOR


236
0:17:40,49 --> 0:17:43,63
OUR TALK RIGHT NOW IT PROTECTS THE EMBRYO.
IF WE OPEN


237
0:17:43,63 --> 0:17:47,159
THE SPECIAL COCONUT UP, LIKE SO, YOU CAN SEE
THE


238
0:17:47,159 --> 0:17:50,39
FIBROUS NATURE OF THE FRUIT WALL AND HERE
YOU CAN SEE


239
0:17:50,39 --> 0:17:53,62
THE ENDOSPERM, WHICH I HAVE TAKEN OUT OVER
HERE AND


240
0:17:53,62 --> 0:17:56,9
PART OF THE SEED COAT IS THIS BROWN MATERIAL
ON THE


241
0:17:56,9 --> 0:17:59,96
OUTSIDE. NOW, AT ONE END OF THE COCONUT WOULD
HAVE


242
0:17:59,96 --> 0:18:4,289
BEEN THE EMBRYO, AND IF YOU LOOK AT COCONUTS,
I HOPE


243
0:18:4,289 --> 0:18:5,89
THAT YOU WILL NEVER LOOK AT THEM THE SAME
WAY WHEN YOU


244
0:18:5,89 --> 0:18:9,62
GO TO THE STORE, IF YOU LOOK AT A COCONUT,
THERE ARE


245
0:18:9,62 --> 0:18:11,64
STRUCTURES ON THE BOTTOM, WHICH ARE KNOWN
COLLOQUIALLY


246
0:18:11,64 --> 0:18:14,62
AS EYES. IF YOU LOOK CAREFULLY AT THESE EYES,
YOU


247
0:18:14,62 --> 0:18:18,59
WILL SEE ONE OF THEM IS BIGGER, BIGGER QUADRANT,
WHICH


248
0:18:18,59 --> 0:18:23,38
OCCUPIES THE COCONUT. THIS COCONUT ORIGINALLY
HAD 3


249
0:18:23,38 --> 0:18:27,85
EMBRYOS THAT WERE FERTILIZED. IT DECIDES AS
SOME


250
0:18:27,85 --> 0:18:30,529
POINT IN ITS DEVELOPMENT WHEN ALL OF THE EMBRYOS
ARE


251
0:18:30,529 --> 0:18:35,419
 SAFE AND SECURE TO ABORT TWO AND CONTINUE
TO GROW ONE


252
0:18:35,419 --> 0:18:38,25
OF THOSE EMBRYOS. THAT EMBRYO IS FOUND UNDER
THE


253
0:18:38,25 --> 0:18:40,83
LARGER QUADRANT, LARGEST QUADRANT. WHAT WE
ARE GOING


254
0:18:40,83 --> 0:18:44,74
TO DO NOW, IS WE ARE GOING TO OPEN THIS COCONUT
UP AND


255
0:18:44,74 --> 0:18:49,76
AS I TOLD SOME OF YOU WHOSE LAB I VISITED
YESTERDAY,


256
0:18:49,76 --> 0:18:51,82
IF YOU SIT IN THE FRONT ROW MAKE SURE YOU
BRING


257
0:18:51,82 --> 0:18:55,97
UMBRELLA OR WEAR YOUR RAINCOAT. SO, ARE WE
ALL SET


258
0:18:55,97 --> 0:18:57,34
HERE. YOU GUYS ALL SET?


259
0:18:57,34 --> 0:19:3,44
ALL RIGHT. WELL ACTUALLY, I ALREADY HAVE ONE


260
0:19:3,44 --> 0:19:8,9
CRACKED. LET ME SHOW YOU THIS NOW.


261
0:19:8,9 --> 0:19:14,159
PEOPLE THAT SAID, WE ARE NOT SITTING IN THE


262
0:19:14,159 --> 0:19:18,27
FRONT HERE. HERE IS A COCONUT THAT I CRACKED
AND


263
0:19:18,27 --> 0:19:21,809
OPENED UP. IF YOU LOOK CAREFULLY AT THIS COCONUT,


264
0:19:21,809 --> 0:19:24,9
AGAIN WE HAVE THIS FIBROUS MATERIAL AROUND
THE


265
0:19:24,9 --> 0:19:26,97
OUTSIDE, WHICH IS PART FRUIT WALL AND PART
SEED COAT


266
0:19:26,97 --> 0:19:29,2
WHICH HAVE JOINED TOGETHER. IF WE OPEN IT
UP, I HAVE


267
0:19:29,2 --> 0:19:32,799
TAKEN THE LIQUID ENDOSPERM OUT YOU CAN SEE
SOME OF THE


268
0:19:32,799 --> 0:19:35,71
CELLULARIZED ENDOSPERM, THE WHITE TISSUE WHICH
WE EAT


269
0:19:35,71 --> 0:19:38,34
 WHICH IS VERY NUTRITIOUS AND NUTRITIOUS
FOR THE


270
0:19:38,34 --> 0:19:41,52
REASONS I MENTIONED BEFORE. THE EYES WOULD
HAVE BEEN


271
0:19:41,52 --> 0:19:44,559
AT THIS END OVER HERE AND I WILL SHOW YOU
A PICTURE OF


272
0:19:44,559 --> 0:19:49,14
THIS IN A MOMENT, BUT IF YOU WANT TO COME
UP AFTER THE


273
0:19:49,14 --> 0:19:52,44
END OF THE LECTURE YOU CAN SEE ONE OF THE
COCONUT


274
0:19:52,44 --> 0:19:54,809
EMBRYOS, THE COCONUT EMBRYO THAT I TOOK OUT
FROM THIS


275
0:19:54,809 --> 0:19:56,89
COCONUT WHEN I OPENED IT UP. IF YOU ARE EVER
AT


276
0:19:56,89 --> 0:19:59,9
A BORING PARTY AND THEY ARE SERVING COCONUTS
AND YOU


277
0:19:59,9 --> 0:20:3,549
WANT TO BECOME THE CENTER, GET A HAMMER AND
DISSECT


278
0:20:3,549 --> 0:20:6,82
OUT THE EMBRYO. AND I PROMISE YOU, NO ONE
THE LOOK AT


279
0:20:6,82 --> 0:20:9,419
YOU THE SAME WAY. I AM NOT SURE HOW THEY WILL
LOOK AT


280
0:20:9,419 --> 0:20:10,49
YOU.


281
0:20:10,49 --> 0:20:18,34
ALL RIGHT LET'S TALK ABOUT THE OTHER FORM
OF


282
0:20:18,34 --> 0:20:20,669
MATERIAL, WHICH IS STORED INSIDE THE COCONUT
BEFORE I


283
0:20:20,669 --> 0:20:24,149
SHOW YOU SOME SLIDES. THAT OTHER FORM OF MATERIAL
IS


284
0:20:24,149 --> 0:20:28,789
STORED IN THE COTYLEDON OF THE EUDICOT. MOST
OF YOU


285
0:20:28,789 --> 0:20:32,85
ARE USING MATERIALS OF THE EUDICOT EVERY DAY,


286
0:20:32,85 --> 0:20:35,35
MATERIALS THAT ARE STORED IN THE COTYLEDONS.
WHEN WE


287
0:20:35,35 --> 0:20:39,95
 EAT PEANUTS, WHEN YOU EAT BEANS, WHEN YOU
EAT PEAS YOU


288
0:20:39,95 --> 0:20:42,6
ARE ESSENTIALLY GAINING YOUR NUTRITION FROM
MATERIALS


289
0:20:42,6 --> 0:20:45,549
THAT ARE STORED IN THE COTYLEDONS, IN THE
SEED LEAVES.


290
0:20:45,549 --> 0:20:48,0
THOSE MATERIALS WOULD NORMALLY BE USED FOR


291
0:20:48,0 --> 0:20:50,99
ESTABLISHING THE SEEDLING. SO, WHEN YOU OPEN
UP


292
0:20:50,99 --> 0:20:54,72
A WALNUT AND TAKE OUT WHAT THIS CRINKLED STRUCTURE
IS


293
0:20:54,72 --> 0:20:58,799
HERE YOU ARE ACTUALLY LOOKING AT A COTYLEDON,
AND THAT


294
0:20:58,799 --> 0:21:2,47
COTYLEDON IS FULL OF OILS AND STARCHES AND
SUGARS AND


295
0:21:2,47 --> 0:21:6,429
IT SERVES THE FUNCTION OF PROVIDING NUTRITION
TO THE


296
0:21:6,429 --> 0:21:9,52
DEVELOPING EMBRYO. NOW I HAVE GIVEN OR ASKED
YOU ALL


297
0:21:9,52 --> 0:21:11,649
TAKE OUT A PEANUT. I WOULD LIKE YOU TO TAKE
OUT THAT


298
0:21:11,649 --> 0:21:14,84
PEANUT NOW. BUT DON'T OPEN IT YET. WHEN YOU
DO OPEN


299
0:21:14,84 --> 0:21:18,89
IT, IF YOU CAN PUT YOUR SHELLS, GIVEN THE
CUT IN THE


300
0:21:18,89 --> 0:21:20,64
BUDGET, THE SHELL WILL PROBABLY BE ON THE
FLOOR NEXT


301
0:21:20,64 --> 0:21:23,2
YEAR, PUT IT IN YOUR POCKET DON'T THROW IT
ON THE


302
0:21:23,2 --> 0:21:27,97
FLOOR. LOOK AT THE OUTSIDE OF THE SHELL. WHAT
IS


303
0:21:27,97 --> 0:21:30,25
THIS MATERIAL ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE MATERIAL?
I SAID


304
0:21:30,25 --> 0:21:32,759
THE SEEDS ARE ON THE INSIDE. WHAT WOULD IT
BE, MAKE


305
0:21:32,759 --> 0:21:39,27
 A GUESS. NOT THE SEED COAT. FURTHER OUT?


306
0:21:39,27 --> 0:21:42,549
WHAT IS IT? IT IS THE FRUIT WALL. OKAY. SO


307
0:21:42,549 --> 0:21:45,88
IN THIS CASE THINK OF THE APPLE. THE FRUIT
WAS SOFT


308
0:21:45,88 --> 0:21:48,96
AND SWEET, BUT THE EMBRYO WAS STILL PROTECTED.
IN


309
0:21:48,96 --> 0:21:53,539
THIS EXAMPLE, THE FRUIT WALL HAS BECOME HARD,
YET IT


310
0:21:53,539 --> 0:21:55,62
IS STILL PROTECTS THE DEVELOPING EMBRYO ON
THE INSIDE.


311
0:21:55,62 --> 0:21:58,49
IT IS NOT SOFT. IT IS NOT MEANT TO BE EATEN
BY


312
0:21:58,49 --> 0:22:0,35
SOME ANIMAL FOR DISPERSAL. NOW I WOULD LIKE
YOU TO DO


313
0:22:0,35 --> 0:22:3,789
IS OPEN THE PEANUT UP AND WHAT YOU WILL NOTICE,
THE


314
0:22:3,789 --> 0:22:6,779
FIRST THING WHEN YOU ENCOUNTER, WHAT ARE THE
PEANUTS


315
0:22:6,779 --> 0:22:11,309
THEY ARE SURROUNDED BY A BROWN PAPERY COATING.
WHAT


316
0:22:11,309 --> 0:22:15,39
IS THAT BROWN PAPERY COATING? ANYBODY KNOW
WHAT THE


317
0:22:15,39 --> 0:22:18,529
BROWN PAPERY COATING IS? YOU SAID IT BEFORE.
IT IS


318
0:22:18,529 --> 0:22:21,45
THE SEED COAT. CORRECT. NOW, WHAT I WOULD
LIKE YOU


319
0:22:21,45 --> 0:22:24,49
TO DO IS TAKE ONE OF THE PEANUTS AND CAREFULLY
SPLIT


320
0:22:24,49 --> 0:22:29,5
IT IN HALF. WHAT YOU ARE SPLITTING IN HALF
YOU WIND


321
0:22:29,5 --> 0:22:33,46
UP WITH TWO, LOOKS LIKE TORPEDO-SHAPED HALVES.
EACH OF


322
0:22:33,46 --> 0:22:37,8
THOSE IS A COTYLEDON. AND AT THE BASE OF ONE
OF THEM


323
0:22:37,8 --> 0:22:41,26
 YOU WILL SEE THE NEW EMBRYONIC SHOOT AXIS.
SO, IN


324
0:22:41,26 --> 0:22:45,22
THIS PARTICULAR CASE THE COTYLEDONS HAVE EXPANDED
TO


325
0:22:45,22 --> 0:22:49,25
FILL THE SEED AND TO ABSORB ALL OF THE ENDOSPERM
AND


326
0:22:49,25 --> 0:22:54,899
THEY PROVIDE THE NUTRITION FOR THE DEVELOPMENT
OF THE


327
0:22:54,899 --> 0:22:58,87
YOUNG EMBRYO AXIS. LET'S LOOK AT A FEW PICTURES
OF


328
0:22:58,87 --> 0:23:6,98
THE COCONUT.


329
0:23:6,98 --> 0:23:12,32
OKAY, FIRST SLIDE IS OF A COCONUT HERE YOU
CAN


330
0:23:12,32 --> 0:23:16,9
SEE THE 3 DIFFERENT EYES OF THE COCONUT. THIS
THE


331
0:23:16,9 --> 0:23:18,83
LARGEST EYE. IT OCCUPIES THE LARGEST QUADRANT.
UNDER


332
0:23:18,83 --> 0:23:22,45
THIS EYE IS THE DEVELOPING EMBRYO. EMBRYOS
WHICH ARE


333
0:23:22,45 --> 0:23:26,929
PRESENT UNDER THESE TWO EYES HAVE ABORTED.
NOW, IF WE


334
0:23:26,929 --> 0:23:29,64
TAKE THE HAMMER AND WE CRACK IT AND THE BEST
PLACE TO


335
0:23:29,64 --> 0:23:33,149
HIT IT IS RIGHT WHERE THE 3 SUTURES, THE 3
ENDS MEET.


336
0:23:33,149 --> 0:23:35,919
WE TAKE THE HAMMER WE CRACK IT AND WE CAN
GET OUT THE


337
0:23:35,919 --> 0:23:39,48
EMBRYO. THIS IS A CENTIMETER SCALE HERE. AND
HERE YOU


338
0:23:39,48 --> 0:23:42,47
CAN SEE THE EMBRYO. THIS WOULD BE THE SHOOT
END AND


339
0:23:42,47 --> 0:23:44,6
AT THIS END OVER HERE WOULD BE WHERE THE COTYLEDON
IS


340
0:23:44,6 --> 0:23:47,8
LOCATED. IF WE LET THAT COTYLEDON ENLARGE,
AS YOU


341
0:23:47,8 --> 0:23:50,399
 WOULD SEE IN THIS SLIDE HERE, THE EMBRYO
WOULD BE


342
0:23:50,399 --> 0:23:53,409
LOCATED HERE AND AS IT ENLARGED ITS COTYLEDON
WOULD


343
0:23:53,409 --> 0:23:57,9
GROW INTO THE LIQUID ENDOSPERM AND GRADUALLY
ABSORB


344
0:23:57,9 --> 0:24:0,0
THE MATERIALS, WHICH WOULD THEN BE USED TO
HELP THIS


345
0:24:0,0 --> 0:24:3,63
COCONUT BECOME ESTABLISHED, AS FAR AS ITS
DEVELOPMENT


346
0:24:3,63 --> 0:24:8,45
IS CONCERNED. THIS IS THE COCONUT AND I ENCOURAGE
YOU


347
0:24:8,45 --> 0:24:12,279
TO SPEND TIME EITHER LOOKING AT THE EMBRYO
HERE OR WE


348
0:24:12,279 --> 0:24:14,23
WILL PUT THE COCONUT IN THE CLASSROOM, HAVE
A LOOK AT


349
0:24:14,23 --> 0:24:17,49
IT OR WHEN YOU NEXT GO TO THE SUPERMARKET
YOU MAY TAKE


350
0:24:17,49 --> 0:24:24,19
A LOOK AT IT. WE SAID THAT ANGIOSPERM'S WERE


351
0:24:24,19 --> 0:24:26,74
SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE THEY DEVELOPED THIS FACILITATED


352
0:24:26,74 --> 0:24:29,83
POLLINATION AND DEVELOPED THE FRUIT OR AS
YOU SAW THE


353
0:24:29,83 --> 0:24:32,289
FRUIT WALL, OR IN THIS CASE, IT BECAME HARD.


354
0:24:32,289 --> 0:24:33,659
THERE WAS ANOTHER REASON WHY THEY WERE


355
0:24:33,659 --> 0:24:36,19
SUCCESSFUL, AND I WANT TO TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT
THAT


356
0:24:36,19 --> 0:24:38,14
OTHER REASON BECAUSE IT IS IMPORTANT AND THERE
ARE


357
0:24:38,14 --> 0:24:40,769
ALSO SOME INTERESTING STORIES ASSOCIATED WITH
IT.


358
0:24:40,769 --> 0:24:43,56
THEY WERE SUCCESSFUL, IN ADDITION TO THE FIRST
TWO


359
0:24:43,56 --> 0:24:47,98
 REASONS THAT I PUT ON THE BOARD BECAUSE,
THEY ALSO


360
0:24:47,98 --> 0:24:53,179
DEVELOPED MEANS OR DIFFERENT MECHANISMS FOR
SEED AND


361
0:24:53,179 --> 0:25:3,84
FRUIT DISPERSAL. SO, MECHANISMS FOR SEED AND
FRUIT


362
0:25:3,84 --> 0:25:8,419
DISPERSAL.


363
0:25:8,419 --> 0:25:11,25
THESE ARE ONE OF THE ADDITIONAL REASONS WHY
THE


364
0:25:11,25 --> 0:25:13,51
ANGIOSPERMS HAVE BECOME SO SUCCESSFUL. SOME
OF THESE


365
0:25:13,51 --> 0:25:18,82
MEANS ARE PASSIVE. I MEAN PASSIVE IS THAT
THERE IS NO


366
0:25:18,82 --> 0:25:26,909
OTHER ORGANISM INVOLVED.


367
0:25:26,909 --> 0:25:29,19
YOU ARE ALL FAMILIAR WITH SOME OF THESE PASSIVE


368
0:25:29,19 --> 0:25:32,75
MEANS. FOR EXAMPLE, DANDELIONS, IF YOU EVER
LOOK AT A


369
0:25:32,75 --> 0:25:36,57
DANDELION IT MAKES A PARACHUTE-LIKE DEVICE,
WHICH


370
0:25:36,57 --> 0:25:39,97
ALLOWS THE SEED OR THE FRUIT TO BE PICKED
UP BY THE


371
0:25:39,97 --> 0:25:43,679
WIND. WIND IS A BIG DISPERSER OF SEEDS, ESPECIALLY


372
0:25:43,679 --> 0:25:46,71
SEEDS THAT ARE SMALL AND LIGHT. FOR THOSE
OF YOU WHO


373
0:25:46,71 --> 0:25:49,529
MIGHT COME FROM THE MIDWEST OR SOUTHWEST WHERE
YOU


374
0:25:49,529 --> 0:25:55,44
HAVE EVER SEEN TUMBLE WEEDS BLOWING ACROSS
THE


375
0:25:55,44 --> 0:25:59,29
HIGHWAY. A TUMBLE WEED IS A PLANT WHICH HAS
A


376
0:25:59,29 --> 0:26:1,64
CONNECTION TO ITS ROOT SYSTEM AND AT SOME
POINT WHEN


377
0:26:1,64 --> 0:26:4,69
 THE SEEDS ARE MATURE, THE ROOT SYSTEM IN
THE SHOOT


378
0:26:4,69 --> 0:26:7,97
SYSTEM ARE SEVERED FROM EACH OTHER AND THE
SHOOT


379
0:26:7,97 --> 0:26:11,48
SYSTEM BECOMES MOBILE. SO, WHEN IT IS WINDY,
THE


380
0:26:11,48 --> 0:26:15,799
WHOLE PLANT TUMBLES AND AS IT TUMBLES IT DISPERSES


381
0:26:15,799 --> 0:26:19,399
SEEDS THROUGHOUT ITS ENVIRONMENT AND CAN TRAVEL
AND


382
0:26:19,399 --> 0:26:22,44
DISPERSE SEEDS OVER GREAT DISTANCES.


383
0:26:22,44 --> 0:26:25,89
ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF PASSIVE MEANS OF SEED AND


384
0:26:25,89 --> 0:26:31,429
FRUIT DISPERSAL IS SHOWN HERE BY THIS COCONUT
PLANT.


385
0:26:31,429 --> 0:26:37,47
HERE IS A PLANT, WHICH IS DISPERSED BY WATER.
THIS


386
0:26:37,47 --> 0:26:42,289
HARD, FIBROUS FRUIT WALL ON THE OUTSIDE MAKES
THE SEED


387
0:26:42,289 --> 0:26:45,75
BUOYANT AND ALSO MAKES IT RESISTANT TO SALT
WATER AND


388
0:26:45,75 --> 0:26:49,46
ALLOWS THE WATER TO TRANSPORT COCONUTS OVER
GREAT


389
0:26:49,46 --> 0:26:52,279
DISTANCES AND ALLOWS THE PLANTS TO BECOME
ESTABLISHED,


390
0:26:52,279 --> 0:26:55,14
ON, AS YOU KNOW PICTURES OF TROPICAL ISLANDS,
VERY


391
0:26:55,14 --> 0:26:59,94
DISTANT FROM WHERE THE ORIGINAL COCONUT STARTED.
THIS


392
0:26:59,94 --> 0:27:2,309
DISPERSAL BY WATER IS ALSO USED BY A LOT OF
OTHER


393
0:27:2,309 --> 0:27:4,86
PLANTS ON THE LAND. FOR EXAMPLE, YOU CAN IMAGINE


394
0:27:4,86 --> 0:27:9,35
STREAMS OR RAIN WATER DISPERSING LARGE AMOUNTS
OF SEED


395
0:27:9,35 --> 0:27:12,8
 MATERIAL. NOW, WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT


396
0:27:12,8 --> 0:27:20,5
ARE MORE ACTIVE MEANS OF DISPERSAL.


397
0:27:20,5 --> 0:27:23,429
IT IS ACTIVE IS SORT OF A -- NOT QUITE THE
WORD,


398
0:27:23,429 --> 0:27:25,679
BUT I CAN'T THINK OF A BETTER ONE. ALL OF
YOU ARE


399
0:27:25,679 --> 0:27:28,59
FAMILIAR WITH THIS MEANS, WHICH IS ACTIVE,
AND I


400
0:27:28,59 --> 0:27:31,75
SUSPECT ALL OF YOU HAVE UNWITTINGLY DONE THIS.
WHEN


401
0:27:31,75 --> 0:27:36,19
YOU WALK THROUGH A WEEDY AREA OR FOREST AND
LOOK AT


402
0:27:36,19 --> 0:27:39,29
THE CUFFS OF YOUR PANTS OR SOCKS YOU HAVE
THINGS STUCK


403
0:27:39,29 --> 0:27:44,12
ON TO THEM. THOSE THINGS ARE EITHER SEEDS
OR FRUITS


404
0:27:44,12 --> 0:27:47,769
WHICH HAVE HAD THEIR OUTER WALLS MODIFIED
WITH HOOKS


405
0:27:47,769 --> 0:27:51,809
TO STICK ON TO YOUR CLOTHES. THIS WAS SUCH
AN


406
0:27:51,809 --> 0:27:55,1
INTERESTING TOPIC TO A FELLOW AS TO HOW THESE
SEEDS


407
0:27:55,1 --> 0:27:58,179
STUCK ON TO HIS CLOTHES HE LOOKED AT THEM
UNDER THE


408
0:27:58,179 --> 0:28:1,33
MICROSCOPE AND HE FOUND THAT HE COULD REPEATEDLY
TAKE


409
0:28:1,33 --> 0:28:3,789
THE SEED ON AND OFF, ON AND OFF, AND THE HOOK
WAS NOT


410
0:28:3,789 --> 0:28:6,279
DAMAGED. THIS IS THE BASIS OF THE DISCOVERY
OF


411
0:28:6,279 --> 0:28:9,48
VELCRO. THIS IS HOW VELCRO WAS DISCOVERED,
BY TRYING


412
0:28:9,48 --> 0:28:13,49
TO UNDERSTAND HOW THIS PARTICULAR SEED OR
FRUIT COULD


413
0:28:13,49 --> 0:28:17,74
 REPEATEDLY BE PULLED ON AND OFF AND NOT
WEAR OUT. SO,


414
0:28:17,74 --> 0:28:21,0
THAT IS A MEANS OF ACTIVE DISPERSAL. ANOTHER
MEANS OF


415
0:28:21,0 --> 0:28:24,33
ACTIVE DISPERSAL IS ILLUSTRATED BY THE APPLE,
WHICH WE


416
0:28:24,33 --> 0:28:28,13
TALKED ABOUT LAST TIME. THE APPLE IS A SWEET
FRUIT.


417
0:28:28,13 --> 0:28:32,59
IT HAS AN ODOR TO IT. ANIMALS WANT TO EAT
THE FRUIT.


418
0:28:32,59 --> 0:28:35,929
MANY PLANTS MAKE FRUITS THAT HAVE A GOOD TASTE
HOPING


419
0:28:35,929 --> 0:28:39,679
THAT AN ANIMAL WILL EAT THEM AND DISPERSE
THE FRUIT TO


420
0:28:39,679 --> 0:28:43,73
AN AREA WHERE THERE IS NONE OF THE PLANT GROWING.


421
0:28:43,73 --> 0:28:46,44
NOW, IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE, WHEN THE ANIMAL
EAT THE


422
0:28:46,44 --> 0:28:49,97
FRUIT, THE SEEDS GO INTO THE ANIMAL'S STOMACH
AND THE


423
0:28:49,97 --> 0:28:54,26
ANIMAL HAS STOMACH ACID AND CAN'T DIGEST THE
SEEDS,


424
0:28:54,26 --> 0:28:57,51
SEEDS AND THE ORGANISM, WHICH DISPERSE THEM,
BUT


425
0:28:57,51 --> 0:29:0,6
MOSTLY THE PLANTS. HAVE HAD TO DEVELOP KIND
OF AN


426
0:29:0,6 --> 0:29:2,98
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT KIND OF ANIMAL WILL
DISPERSE


427
0:29:2,98 --> 0:29:5,539
THEM. HOW LONG IS THE SEED GOING TO REMAIN
IN THE


428
0:29:5,539 --> 0:29:8,6
ANIMALS STOMACH. HOW THICK SHOULD THE SEED
COAT BE SO


429
0:29:8,6 --> 0:29:11,919
THAT THE SEED IS NOT TOTALLY DIGESTED BY THE
TIME THE


430
0:29:11,919 --> 0:29:16,7
ANIMAL DEFECATES. SO, WHAT YOU FIND IS THAT
SOMETIMES


431
0:29:16,7 --> 0:29:18,36
 WHEN AN ANIMAL, WHICH IS THE WRONG KIND
OF ANIMAL THAT


432
0:29:18,36 --> 0:29:20,529
EATS THE FRUIT, THE SEED NEVER GETS OUT. IT
IS


433
0:29:20,529 --> 0:29:22,73
DIGESTED. THE RIGHT KIND OF ANIMAL IN AN AREA
WHICH


434
0:29:22,73 --> 0:29:29,12
EATS THE FRUIT WILL PASS THE SEED THROUGH
ITS BODY.


435
0:29:29,12 --> 0:29:32,23
BUT NOT ONLY IS THE SEED COAT DIGESTED JUST
TO THE


436
0:29:32,23 --> 0:29:35,159
POINT WHERE THE SEED IS STILL ALIVE BUT MANY
PLANT


437
0:29:35,159 --> 0:29:37,84
DEPENDS ON THE ANIMALS TO DIGEST THE SEED
COATS TO


438
0:29:37,84 --> 0:29:41,23
WEAKEN THEM. SO, THAT BY THE TIME THE ANIMAL


439
0:29:41,23 --> 0:29:43,98
DEFECATES AND THE SEED IS RELEASED TO THE
OUTSIDE THE


440
0:29:43,98 --> 0:29:46,97
SEED COAT IS WEAKENED TO THE STATE WHERE THE
SEED CAN


441
0:29:46,97 --> 0:29:50,13
GERMINATE RIGHT AWAY. SO, THERE IS THIS PARTICULAR


442
0:29:50,13 --> 0:29:54,98
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SEED AND THE ANIMAL
THAT


443
0:29:54,98 --> 0:29:59,1
DISPERSES IT AND SOMETIMES IF THAT ANIMAL
DISAPPEARS


444
0:29:59,1 --> 0:30:2,269
THE SEED DISPERSAL WILL NOT OCCUR AT ALL OR
NOT IN


445
0:30:2,269 --> 0:30:6,19
A VERY PRODUCTIVE WAY. FINALLY, THE LAST WAY
I WANT


446
0:30:6,19 --> 0:30:9,299
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT FACILITATED SEED AND
FRUIT


447
0:30:9,299 --> 0:30:17,139
DISPERSION BY ANIMALS OCCURS WITH INSECTS.


448
0:30:17,139 --> 0:30:24,519
INSECT I WANT TO TALK TO YOU MOSTLY ARE ANTS.
 MANY SEEDS, AS IT TURNS OUT, WHICH ARE


449
0:30:24,519 --> 0:30:31,279
ATTRACTIVE TO ANTS, HERE WE HAVE THE SEED.
THESE


450
0:30:31,279 --> 0:30:35,1
PLANTS, WHICH PRODUCE THESE SEEDS THAT ARE
DISPERSED


451
0:30:35,1 --> 0:30:41,72
BY ANTS ALSO PRODUCE A NEW TISSUE.


452
0:30:41,72 --> 0:30:43,659
WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE NAME. A NEW


453
0:30:43,659 --> 0:30:47,429
TISSUE WHICH IS OFTEN BUT NOT ALWAYS WHITE.
WHITE IS


454
0:30:47,429 --> 0:30:51,539
ATTRACTIVE TO ANTS. OFTEN BUT NOT ALWAYS WHITE.
AND


455
0:30:51,539 --> 0:30:57,71
THIS NEW TISSUE, THE ANTS FIND THEY CAN'T
RESIST IT.


456
0:30:57,71 --> 0:31:0,75
WHAT THEY DO IS, THEY GO OUT, THE ANTS GO
OUT AND THEY


457
0:31:0,75 --> 0:31:4,12
HARVEST SEEDS WHICH HAVE PRODUCED THIS NEW
TISSUE,


458
0:31:4,12 --> 0:31:6,69
WHITE TISSUE, AND THEY CARRY THE SEEDS BACK
TO THEIR


459
0:31:6,69 --> 0:31:10,32
BURROWS OR WHEREVER THEY HAPPEN TO BE LIVING.
THERE


460
0:31:10,32 --> 0:31:14,139
IN THE BURROW, THEY CONSUME THE WHITE TISSUE
AND GET


461
0:31:14,139 --> 0:31:16,11
THEIR REWARD FOR HAVING COLLECTED IT AND THEN
THEY


462
0:31:16,11 --> 0:31:19,46
ABANDON THE SEED. AND, HERE WE NOW HAVE ESSENTIALLY


463
0:31:19,46 --> 0:31:23,389
SEEDS PLANTED IN THE GROUND BY THE ANTS AND
DEPENDING


464
0:31:23,389 --> 0:31:25,759
ON HOW DEEP THE SEED IS IN THE GROUND AND
DEPENDING


465
0:31:25,759 --> 0:31:28,32
UPON WHETHER THE GROUND IS DISTURBED, DEPENDING
UPON


466
0:31:28,32 --> 0:31:31,399
 WHETHER IT RAINS THOSE SEEDS WILL GERMINATE.
IT HAS


467
0:31:31,399 --> 0:31:33,759
BEEN ESTIMATED IN AREAS LIKE NEW ENGLAND,
THAT A VERY


468
0:31:33,759 --> 0:31:38,36
HIGH PERCENT 30 OR 40 PERCENT OF WILD SEEDS
MAY


469
0:31:38,36 --> 0:31:42,75
ACTUALLY BE DISPERSED OR PLANTED BY ANTS.
NOW I WOULD


470
0:31:42,75 --> 0:31:45,8
LIKE TO SHOW YOU, UH OH, SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED
HERE.


471
0:31:45,8 --> 0:31:53,7
LET'S SEE IF WE CAN DO THIS AGAIN. IF NOT,
WE HAVE


472
0:31:53,7 --> 0:31:58,549
ALWAYS THE BIG GUYS IN THE BACK THERE. HERE
WE GO,


473
0:31:58,549 --> 0:32:0,74
LET'S LOOK AT THE NEXT SLIDES, EVERYTHING
LOOKS LIKE


474
0:32:0,74 --> 0:32:8,529
IT IS OKAY. FOR SOME STRANGE REASON. THE FIRST


475
0:32:8,529 --> 0:32:11,69
EXAMPLE OF A SEED THAT I WANT TO SHOW YOU,
DISPERSAL


476
0:32:11,69 --> 0:32:14,289
IS ONE THAT GROWS OUTSIDE HERE THAT MANY OF
YOU MAY


477
0:32:14,289 --> 0:32:16,74
HAVE SEEN AND PASSED. AND I ENCOURAGE YOU
TO STOP AND


478
0:32:16,74 --> 0:32:18,299
LOOK AT THESE. THERE ARE SOME OF THESE GROWING
UP


479
0:32:18,299 --> 0:32:21,6
NEAR EVANS HALL, FOR SURE. THIS IS CALLED
IMPATIENCE,


480
0:32:21,6 --> 0:32:25,279
THIS PARTICULAR PLANT. HERE IS THE FLOWER
AND HERE IS


481
0:32:25,279 --> 0:32:28,899
THE FRUIT OF THE IMPATIENCE. THIS PARTICULAR
FRUIT OF


482
0:32:28,899 --> 0:32:31,159
THE IMPATIENCE, AND WE WILL LOOK AT IT IN
A HIGHER


483
0:32:31,159 --> 0:32:34,299
POWER HERE, THIS PARTICULAR FRUIT IS UNDER
TENSION.


484
0:32:34,299 --> 0:32:38,419
 IT IS LIKE A SPRING WHICH IS READY TO POP.
INSIDE


485
0:32:38,419 --> 0:32:42,12
THIS FRUIT ARE THE SEEDS. AND WHEN AN ANIMAL
COMES BY


486
0:32:42,12 --> 0:32:45,47
OR IN YOUR CASE YOU COME BY AND BRUSH NEXT
TO THIS


487
0:32:45,47 --> 0:32:50,59
SEED CAPSULE YOU CAUSE IT TO EXPLODE. AND
WHEN IT


488
0:32:50,59 --> 0:32:53,1
EXPLODES, THE TENSION IS RELEASED AND THE
SEEDS ARE


489
0:32:53,1 --> 0:32:55,84
CAST GREAT DISTANCES. IF IT IS AN ANIMAL THEY
ARE


490
0:32:55,84 --> 0:32:58,309
CAST INTO THE ANIMALS FUR. THEN THE ANIMAL
WALKS AWAY,


491
0:32:58,309 --> 0:33:2,12
PRESUMABLY THE SEED IS THEN DROPPED OFF AT
A NEW AREA.


492
0:33:2,12 --> 0:33:4,73
THIS IS AN INTERESTING EXAMPLE OF TOUCH AND
IT WOULD


493
0:33:4,73 --> 0:33:7,99
BE FACILITATED IN THE SENSE THAT IT IS ACTIVE.
HERE


494
0:33:7,99 --> 0:33:10,549
IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF SEED DISPERSAL, THIS
IS PLANT


495
0:33:10,549 --> 0:33:13,929
CALLED SALVIA, WHICH IS A PLANT THAT GROWS
HERE IN


496
0:33:13,929 --> 0:33:16,85
CALIFORNIA. HERE, ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TOUCH
THE


497
0:33:16,85 --> 0:33:20,6
CAPSULE AND THAT RELEASES THIS SPRING TENSION
AND THE


498
0:33:20,6 --> 0:33:24,299
SEED GETS PROPELLED FORWARD. EXAMPLE OF WIND


499
0:33:24,299 --> 0:33:27,71
DISPERSAL, THIS IS MILK WEED, LIKE WE TALKED
ABOUT


500
0:33:27,71 --> 0:33:31,45
WITH DANDELIONS IN WHICH THE SEEDS PRODUCE
THIS TUFT


501
0:33:31,45 --> 0:33:35,13
OF SOFT MATERIAL THAT MAKES THE SEED LIGHT
AND EASILY


502
0:33:35,13 --> 0:33:38,36
 TRANSPORTED BY THE WIND. FOR THOSE OF YOU
WHO ARE


503
0:33:38,36 --> 0:33:44,0
COOKS, THESE PARTICULAR SEEDS, THIS IS NUTMEG,
AND


504
0:33:44,0 --> 0:33:47,82
THIS IS MACE. THIS IS THE MATERIAL THAT IS
USED AS A


505
0:33:47,82 --> 0:33:50,47
SPICE. IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE WHAT THIS SEED
HAS


506
0:33:50,47 --> 0:33:54,94
DONE OR PLANT HAS DONE IS PRODUCE THIS STRUCTURE
WHICH


507
0:33:54,94 --> 0:33:58,559
WE CALL MACE ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE SEED COVERING
THE


508
0:33:58,559 --> 0:34:2,659
SEED WHICH MADE IT ATTRACTIVE TO WHATEVER
ANIMAL WAS


509
0:34:2,659 --> 0:34:5,399
DISPERSING THIS SEED. THIS IS A RELATIVELY
LARGE


510
0:34:5,399 --> 0:34:7,809
SEED. SO, PERHAPS THE ANIMAL PUT THE WHOLE
SEED ITS


511
0:34:7,809 --> 0:34:10,819
BODY OR TOOK THE WHOLE SEED WITH IT AND THEN
CONSUMED


512
0:34:10,819 --> 0:34:13,76
IT GRADUALLY BECAUSE THE MACE, THE ANIMAL
FOUND VERY


513
0:34:13,76 --> 0:34:18,319
ATTRACTIVE. HERE IS AN EXAMPLE OF A SEED NOW
OR A


514
0:34:18,319 --> 0:34:21,419
PLANT. THIS IS A MEMBER OF THE PEA FAMILY
IN WHICH THE


515
0:34:21,419 --> 0:34:23,899
PLANT HAS MADE SORT OF THE IS CONTRASTING
TYPE OF


516
0:34:23,899 --> 0:34:27,679
SITUATION WHERE THERE IS SHOWY RED BASE AND
BLACK


517
0:34:27,679 --> 0:34:30,75
SEEDS, PRESUMABLY TO ATTRACT WHATEVER ANIMAL
IS


518
0:34:30,75 --> 0:34:33,44
INVOLVED. HERE IS ANOTHER ONE WHERE WE HAVE
CONTRAST


519
0:34:33,44 --> 0:34:36,71
BETWEEN THE BACKGROUND AND THE SEED TO AGAIN,
ATTRACT


520
0:34:36,71 --> 0:34:41,419
 SOME ANIMAL. HERE IS A SEED OF A TYPE OF
PALM. IT IS


521
0:34:41,419 --> 0:34:43,77
ULTRAMARINE IN COLOR. A VERY UNUSUAL COLOR
IN THE


522
0:34:43,77 --> 0:34:46,149
PLANT KINGDOM. ONE HAS TO PRESUME, ALTHOUGH
I DON'T


523
0:34:46,149 --> 0:34:49,19
KNOW WHAT IT IS, THAT WHATEVER WAS USED TO
DISPERSE


524
0:34:49,19 --> 0:34:52,829
THE SEED MUST KEY IN ON THIS PARTICULAR COLOR.
THIS


525
0:34:52,829 --> 0:34:56,1
IS A VERY SUCCESSFUL ONE. THE LAST ONE I WANT
TO SHOW


526
0:34:56,1 --> 0:35:0,4
YOU LOOKS LIKE EYES BUT THEY ARE NOT. THESE
ARE SEEDS


527
0:35:0,4 --> 0:35:3,73
WHICH ARE DISPERSED BY ANIMALS, BY INSECTS,
LARGE ANTS


528
0:35:3,73 --> 0:35:6,5
IN THE TROPICS. AND ON THE OUTSIDE YOU CAN
SEE THE


529
0:35:6,5 --> 0:35:9,579
FRUIT WALL WHICH IS RED AND THIS WHITE MATERIAL
IS


530
0:35:9,579 --> 0:35:12,64
THIS NEW LAYER OF TISSUE FORMED WHICH IS ATTRACTIVE
TO


531
0:35:12,64 --> 0:35:16,13
INSECTS MOSTLY TO ANTS AND YOU CAN SEE THE
BLACK SEED


532
0:35:16,13 --> 0:35:20,77
INSIDE WHICH IS USED BY THE PLANT TO GROW
ONCE IT IS


533
0:35:20,77 --> 0:35:23,869
BURIED IN THE GROUND BY THE ANT. THESE ARE
EXAMPLES


534
0:35:23,869 --> 0:35:28,329
OF SEEDS OF VARIOUS TYPES OF PLANTS AND OF
DISPERSAL


535
0:35:28,329 --> 0:35:33,79
MECHANISM. OKAY. LET'S CONTINUE NOW AND WE
WILL LOOK


536
0:35:33,79 --> 0:35:36,4
AT THE SLIDES IN A SECOND.


537
0:35:36,4 --> 0:35:43,8
OKAY, YOU CAN PUT THE SCREEN UP, MAYBE.
 FINALLY WHAT I WANT TO DO IS TALK ABOUT


538
0:35:43,8 --> 0:35:47,92
GERMINATION OF THE SEED. AFTER THE EMBRYO
IS MATURE,


539
0:35:47,92 --> 0:35:52,81
AFTER THE ENDOSPERM HAS BEEN ABSORBED IN THE
COTYLEDON


540
0:35:52,81 --> 0:35:55,75
OR IS STILL PRESENT IN THIS MATURE COCONUT,
WHICH WE


541
0:35:55,75 --> 0:35:59,1
HAVE HERE, I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT GERMINATION.


542
0:35:59,1 --> 0:36:2,41
OF ALL OF THE STAGES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF
A PLANT


543
0:36:2,41 --> 0:36:6,0
PROBABLY GERMINATION IS THE MOST DIFFICULT.


544
0:36:6,0 --> 0:36:8,65
BECAUSE, THE PLANT HAS TO GET ITSELF


545
0:36:8,65 --> 0:36:11,44
ESTABLISHED, HAS TO GET WATER, HAS TO START


546
0:36:11,44 --> 0:36:15,3
PHOTOSYNTHESIZING ALL BEFORE THE NUTRIENTS
ARE


547
0:36:15,3 --> 0:36:18,74
EXHAUSTED INSIDE THE COTYLEDONS OR INSIDE
THE


548
0:36:18,74 --> 0:36:21,39
ENDOSPERM. SO, THIS IS THE MOST DIFFICULT
TIME FOR


549
0:36:21,39 --> 0:36:26,53
THE PLANT. I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE
TYPES OF


550
0:36:26,53 --> 0:36:29,72
ISSUES THAT SEEDS HAVE TO ADDRESS IN THEIR


551
0:36:29,72 --> 0:36:32,849
ESTABLISHMENT. THE FIRST ISSUE WHICH I WOULD
LIKE


552
0:36:32,849 --> 0:36:35,81
TO POINT OUT TO YOU AND ALL OF YOU ARE AWARE
OF


553
0:36:35,81 --> 0:36:41,3
THIS, IS THAT HERE IS THE GROUND LEVEL, AND
HERE IS


554
0:36:41,3 --> 0:36:44,319
A SEED, LET'S SAY BURIED A COUPLE INCHES IN
THE


555
0:36:44,319 --> 0:36:48,22
 GROUND. THE SEED HAS TO GET UP TO THE SUNLIGHT
AND


556
0:36:48,22 --> 0:36:51,4
START PHOTOSYNTHESIZING BEFORE IT RUNS OUT
OF


557
0:36:51,4 --> 0:36:56,17
NUTRIENTS. IN ORDER TO GET UP TO THE TOP IT
HAS TO


558
0:36:56,17 --> 0:36:58,66
PASS ESSENTIALLY, A MINE FIELD OF POTENTIAL


559
0:36:58,66 --> 0:37:1,96
OBSTACLES. PERHAPS ROCKS ARE IN THE WAY, PERHAPS


560
0:37:1,96 --> 0:37:5,829
THERE IS HARD SOIL. HOW DOES THIS SEEDLING
GET UP


561
0:37:5,829 --> 0:37:15,38
TO THE TOP WITHOUT DAMAGING ITSELF? WE SAID
THAT


562
0:37:15,38 --> 0:37:20,74
WE HAD THE MERISTEM HERE. THE MERISTEM. THIS


563
0:37:20,74 --> 0:37:24,53
MERISTEM, IF THE SEED GERMINATED LIKE SO,
WOULD


564
0:37:24,53 --> 0:37:28,859
HAVE TO PUSH UP AGAINST THE OBSTACLES THAT
WERE IN


565
0:37:28,859 --> 0:37:30,72
THE GROUND. THIS MERISTEM, AS YOU MIGHT GUESS,
IS


566
0:37:30,72 --> 0:37:35,77
A VERY DELICATE PART OF THE PLANT. THE PLANT
DOES


567
0:37:35,77 --> 0:37:39,26
NOT WANT TO USE THE MERISTEM AS BATTERING
A RAM.


568
0:37:39,26 --> 0:37:41,73
DOESN'T WANT TO USE THE MERISTEM. SO, LET
ME SHOW


569
0:37:41,73 --> 0:37:45,5
YOU WHAT PLANTS DO AND THIS IS WHY I INTRODUCED
YOU


570
0:37:45,5 --> 0:37:49,619
TO THE TERMS EPICOTYL AND HYPOCOTYL. IN MANY


571
0:37:49,619 --> 0:37:52,72
PLANTS, INSTEAD OF USING THE MERISTEM AS


572
0:37:52,72 --> 0:37:56,4
A BATTERING RAM, I WILL MAKE THE BIT HIGHER
FOR


573
0:37:56,4 --> 0:38:2,839
 YOU, THE SOIL LEVEL. WHAT THE PLANT DOES
IS THE


574
0:38:2,839 --> 0:38:10,6
FOLLOWING: HERE IS THE SEED, HERE IS THE AXIS,


575
0:38:10,6 --> 0:38:15,7
HERE ARE THE COTYLEDONS AND HERE IS THE MERISTEM.


576
0:38:15,7 --> 0:38:19,77
MERISTEM IS LOCATED RIGHT HERE. AND THIS IS
THE


577
0:38:19,77 --> 0:38:19,77
HYPOCOTYL.


578
0:38:19,77 --> 0:38:28,869
SO WHAT THE PLANT DOES IS IT BENDS OVER. AND


579
0:38:28,869 --> 0:38:33,1
THE BATTERING RAM BECOME THE HYPOCOTYL. THE
HYPOCOTYL


580
0:38:33,1 --> 0:38:37,3
PUSHES ITS WAY UP THROUGH THE SOIL AND THEN
ONCE IT


581
0:38:37,3 --> 0:38:41,15
GETS UP TO THE SURFACE OF THE SOIL IT STRAIGHTENS
OUT


582
0:38:41,15 --> 0:38:44,609
AND THE PLANT STARTS GROWING UPRIGHT. IN MANY
PLANTS


583
0:38:44,609 --> 0:38:48,56
THE HYPOCOTYL IS THE BATTERING RAM AND IN
SOME PLANTS


584
0:38:48,56 --> 0:38:51,7
LIKE PEAS, AND YOU WILL SEE SOME OF THESE
IN THE LAB,


585
0:38:51,7 --> 0:38:58,5
EPICOTYL IS THE BATTERING RAM.


586
0:38:58,5 --> 0:39:1,53
FINALLY, I WANT TO MENTION THIS IS USUALLY
THE


587
0:39:1,53 --> 0:39:8,26
SITUATION IN EUDICOTS. IN MONOCOTS WE DON'T
REALLY


588
0:39:8,26 --> 0:39:11,319
HAVE A KIND OF A CLEAR EPICOTYL AND HYPOCOTYL,
EVEN


589
0:39:11,319 --> 0:39:14,23
THOUGH I DREW IT FOR YOU. TECHNICALLY IT IS
THERE BUT


590
0:39:14,23 --> 0:39:17,299
NEVER DEVELOPS TO A POINT WHERE IT HAS ANY
FUNCTION.


591
0:39:17,299 --> 0:39:21,98
 HOW DO MONOCOT SEEDS PROTECT THEMSELVES?
MONOCOT


592
0:39:21,98 --> 0:39:32,77
SEEDS PROTECT THEMSELVES, SEEDLINGS PROTECT
THEIR


593
0:39:32,77 --> 0:39:43,18
MERISTEM BY MAKING A COVER


594
0:39:43,18 --> 0:39:46,589
OR A SHEATH, A COVER OR A


595
0:39:46,589 --> 0:39:52,359
SHEATH, TO COVER THE MERISTEM.


596
0:39:52,359 --> 0:39:55,21
REASON I WANT YOU TO KNOW THE NAME OF THE
SHEATH


597
0:39:55,21 --> 0:39:57,67
IS BECAUSE WE WILL RETURN TO IT IN A DISCUSSION
VERY


598
0:39:57,67 --> 0:40:1,15
SOON. I WANT YOU TO KNOW WHERE IT CAME FROM.
SO,


599
0:40:1,15 --> 0:40:11,54
HERE IS THE SEED, HERE IS THE SHOOT AXIS,
HERE IS THE


600
0:40:11,54 --> 0:40:18,54
MERISTEM. AND HERE IS THE COVER OR THE SHEATH.


601
0:40:18,54 --> 0:40:22,42
COVERS IT UP LIKE SO. PROTECTS THAT MERISTEM.
IT IS


602
0:40:22,42 --> 0:40:26,9
THIS COVER WHICH GROWS UP THROUGH THE SOIL.


603
0:40:26,9 --> 0:40:30,109
WE GIVE THIS COVER A SPECIAL NAME, THAT IS


604
0:40:30,109 --> 0:40:32,559
REALLY WHAT I WANT YOU TO KNOW NOW, PUT IT
IN YOUR


605
0:40:32,559 --> 0:40:34,88
NOTE BECAUSE WE WILL RETURN TO IT. WE CALL
IT THE


606
0:40:34,88 --> 0:40:40,309
COLEOPTILE. COLEOPTILE. WE WILL RETURN TO
IT LATER


607
0:40:40,309 --> 0:40:47,88
ON.


608
0:40:47,88 --> 0:40:50,109
FINALLY, WHAT I WANT TO DO BEFORE WE LEAVE
TODAY


609
0:40:50,109 --> 0:40:53,859
IS TO GIVE YOU A FEW LANDMARK THAT WE NEED
TO HAVE AS


610
0:40:53,859 --> 0:40:57,15
OUR VOCABULARY, ONLY A FEW FOR THE REST OF
THE


611
0:40:57,15 --> 0:41:0,77
 DISCUSSION OF THE PLANTS. SO LETS MAKE HERE
A PLANT


612
0:41:0,77 --> 0:41:3,53
WHICH HAS ALREADY GERMINATED AND IS GROWING
OUTSIDE AS


613
0:41:3,53 --> 0:41:7,52
YOU HAVE ALREADY. I WANT TO PUT A FEW TERMS
ON HERE


614
0:41:7,52 --> 0:41:10,7
THAT WE'LL BE REFERRING TO FOR THE REST OF
THE CLASS.


615
0:41:10,7 --> 0:41:13,68
SO, FIRST OF ALL WE WILL PUT A LEAF ON HERE.


616
0:41:13,68 --> 0:41:17,829
THIS WHOLE THING IS A LEAF.


617
0:41:17,829 --> 0:41:20,72
A LEAF. MOST OF YOU KNOW THIS TERM. LEAF IS


618
0:41:20,72 --> 0:41:25,859
DIVIDED INTO TWO PARTS. THE BLADE, WHICH IS
WHAT YOU


619
0:41:25,859 --> 0:41:29,559
KNOW OF AS THE LEAF OR THINK OF AS THE LEAF
AND A


620
0:41:29,559 --> 0:41:33,109
PORTION WHICH CONNECTS THE BLADE TO THE STEM,
THAT IS


621
0:41:33,109 --> 0:41:38,99
THE PETIOLE.


622
0:41:38,99 --> 0:41:49,809
THE POINT OF ATTACHMENT OF THE LEAF, OF THE
LEAF


623
0:41:49,809 --> 0:42:0,47
TO THE STEM IS CALLED A NODE. HERE WE CAN
HAVE


624
0:42:0,47 --> 0:42:4,22
SEVERAL NODES. YOU HAVE A NODE HERE AND A
NODE HERE


625
0:42:4,22 --> 0:42:7,43
AND NODE HERE.


626
0:42:7,43 --> 0:42:11,21
AND AS YOU MIGHT GUESS WE HAVE A NAME FOR
THE


627
0:42:11,21 --> 0:42:20,69
REGION BETWEEN NODES,


628
0:42:20,69 --> 0:42:28,3
CALLED THE INTERNODE.


629
0:42:28,3 --> 0:42:30,119
ONLY REALLY ONE OTHER THING THAT I NEED TO
PUT


630
0:42:30,119 --> 0:42:35,47
 ON HERE FOR YOU. SO HERE IS AN EXAMPLE OF
A PLANT, IN


631
0:42:35,47 --> 0:42:38,27
WHICH YOU CAN SEE A SERIES OF NODES WHERE
THE LEAF IS


632
0:42:38,27 --> 0:42:42,54
ATTACHED AND A SERIES OF INTERNODES BETWEEN
WHERE THE


633
0:42:42,54 --> 0:42:46,39
LEAVES ARE ATTACHED. NOW WHY ARE NODES IMPORTANT?


634
0:42:46,39 --> 0:42:49,41
WHY DO WE SPECIFICALLY DESIGNATE WHY A NODE
IS


635
0:42:49,41 --> 0:42:55,309
IMPORTANT? BECAUSE IF YOU LOOKED HERE IN THIS


636
0:42:55,309 --> 0:43:1,38
REGION, THIS SORT OF ANGLE BETWEEN THE LEAF
AND THE


637
0:43:1,38 --> 0:43:5,92
STEM, THIS ANGLE IS CALLED AN AXLE. IF YOU
LOOKED IN


638
0:43:5,92 --> 0:43:9,16
THE AXLE OR THE ANGLE BETWEEN THE LEAF AND
THE STEM,


639
0:43:9,16 --> 0:43:13,9
YOU GENERALLY WOULD FIND BUMPS. AND WHAT ARE
THESE


640
0:43:13,9 --> 0:43:20,42
BUMPS? THESE BUMPS BECOME THE NEW BRANCHES.
THAT IS


641
0:43:20,42 --> 0:43:25,79
WHAT THEY BECOME, NEW BRANCHES. AND THEY ORIGINATE


642
0:43:25,79 --> 0:43:29,92
FROM A BUMP WE CALL THAT BUMP BECAUSE IT IS
IN AN IS


643
0:43:29,92 --> 0:43:41,619
AXLE. WE CALL IT AXILLARY BUD.


644
0:43:41,619 --> 0:43:42,98
ON THIS EXAMPLE HERE


645
0:43:42,98 --> 0:43:46,18
I WANT YOU ALL TO LOOK AT THIS; HERE WE HAVE
BRANCHES


646
0:43:46,18 --> 0:43:50,72
GROWING OUT. EACH OF THESE BRANCHES, EVEN
THOUGH


647
0:43:50,72 --> 0:43:53,329
THERE IS NO LONGER A LEAF STILL ATTACHED HERE,
EACH OF


648
0:43:53,329 --> 0:43:55,99
THESE BRANCH WOULD BE GROWING OUT FROM A NODE.
SO,


649
0:43:55,99 --> 0:43:58,18
 EVERY PLACE THAT THERE IS A BRANCH, THERE
WOULD HAVE


650
0:43:58,18 --> 0:44:1,13
BEEN A LEAF AND EVERY PLACE WHERE THERE IS
A LEAF


651
0:44:1,13 --> 0:44:3,55
THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A NODE. TAKE A LOOK
AT A PLANT


652
0:44:3,55 --> 0:44:8,319
NEXT TIME. I WANT YOU TO REALIZE THAT ALL
OF THE


653
0:44:8,319 --> 0:44:10,569
VARIETY THAT YOU SEE OUTSIDE OF PLANTS EXCEPT
FOR


654
0:44:10,569 --> 0:44:15,75
FRUITS AND FLOWERS IS BASED UPON CHANGES IN
LEAVES,


655
0:44:15,75 --> 0:44:20,24
PETIOLES, STEMS, AXILLARY BUDS, BRANCHES.
ALL OF THE


656
0:44:20,24 --> 0:44:22,859
VARIETY. JUST A FEW SIMPLE ORGANS CHANGE AND
GIVE YOU


657
0:44:22,859 --> 0:44:24,76
ALL OF THE DIVERSITY OF FORM.


658
0:44:24,76 --> 0:44:30,45
LET'S LOOK AT THE LAST SERIES OF SLIDES. AND


659
0:44:30,45 --> 0:44:38,45
REALIZE THAT THIS PLANT HERE IS A GENERALIZED
PLANT.


660
0:44:38,45 --> 0:44:40,839
OKAY. HERE IS OUR GENERALIZED PLANT WITH THE


661
0:44:40,839 --> 0:44:45,65
LANDMARKS WE PUT ON THERE A SECOND AGO, AND
WHAT I


662
0:44:45,65 --> 0:44:49,309
WANT TO POINT OUT TO YOU ARE THE NODES, THE
INTERNODE,


663
0:44:49,309 --> 0:44:53,369
THE VEGETATIVE AXILLARY BUD, WHICH HAS GROWN
OUT.


664
0:44:53,369 --> 0:44:55,329
HERE IS AN EXAMPLE OF AN AXILLARY BUD THAT
HASN'T


665
0:44:55,329 --> 0:44:58,67
GROWN OUT YET. AND WHAT I DIDN'T PUT ON THE
PICTURE


666
0:44:58,67 --> 0:45:1,73
BECAUSE THERE WAS NO ROOM AS WELL AS SHOOT
SYSTEM


667
0:45:1,73 --> 0:45:4,45
 THERE IS ALSO A ROOT SYSTEM DOWN AT THE
BOTTOM AND WE


668
0:45:4,45 --> 0:45:7,869
WILL SPEND TIME LOOKING AT THE ROOT SYSTEM.
HERE IS


669
0:45:7,869 --> 0:45:10,89
GERMINATION THAT WE TALKED ABOUT WHEN A SEEDLING
IS


670
0:45:10,89 --> 0:45:14,54
ESTABLISHED. NOW, THIS IS IN A MONOCOT. HERE
IS THE


671
0:45:14,54 --> 0:45:18,27
COLEOPTILE AND THE COLEOPTILE IS PROTECTING
THE


672
0:45:18,27 --> 0:45:20,75
MERISTEM WHICH IS BURIED DOWN HERE AT THIS
NODE


673
0:45:20,75 --> 0:45:24,99
REGION. AS THE COLEOPTILE GROWS UP TO THE
SOIL IT


674
0:45:24,99 --> 0:45:27,93
PUSHES SOIL AWAY AND AS SOON AS IT PERCEIVES
LIGHT IT


675
0:45:27,93 --> 0:45:30,359
STOPS GROWING AND THE SHOOT SYSTEM, THE APICAL


676
0:45:30,359 --> 0:45:32,7
MERISTEM SYSTEM, WHICH IS CONTAINED WITHIN,
BURSTS


677
0:45:32,7 --> 0:45:35,43
THROUGH IT AND THE SEEDLING THEN IS ABLE TO


678
0:45:35,43 --> 0:45:38,329
PHOTOSYNTHESIZE. HERE IS AN EXAMPLE NOW OF
ONE IN


679
0:45:38,329 --> 0:45:41,99
WHICH THE, IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE, THE HYPOCOTYL
IS


680
0:45:41,99 --> 0:45:43,96
THE BATTERING RAM, AS WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE.
IT IS


681
0:45:43,96 --> 0:45:46,49
THE REGION BELOW WHERE THE COTYLEDONS ARE
ATTACHED,


682
0:45:46,49 --> 0:45:48,54
AND NOTICE, THIS IS THE PART THIS IS PUSHING
UP


683
0:45:48,54 --> 0:45:52,22
AGAINST THE SOIL. NOT THE MERISTEM. BY THE
TIME THE


684
0:45:52,22 --> 0:45:55,41
SEEDLING GETS TO THE SOIL SURFACE THE SEEDLING
NOW


685
0:45:55,41 --> 0:45:57,41
 BEGINS TO STRAIGHTEN OUT AND THE MERISTEM,
WHICH IS


686
0:45:57,41 --> 0:46:0,67
INSIDE HERE OR OVER HERE, IS PROTECTED FROM
BATTERING


687
0:46:0,67 --> 0:46:4,73
OF THE SOIL. LAST SLIDE YOU WILL SEE THIS
IN THE LAB


688
0:46:4,73 --> 0:46:7,48
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS. THIS REGION HERE IS
THE


689
0:46:7,48 --> 0:46:11,8
BATTERING RAM, THE MERISTEM IS CONTAINED WITHIN
HERE.


690
0:46:11,8 --> 0:48:11,8
HAVE A NICE WEEKEND SEE YOU ON MONDAY, I HOPE.
