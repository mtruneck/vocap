###20 My name is Dr. Tierney Thys
###23 I am a National Geographic Explorer,
###25 marine biologist and filmmaker.
###28 My work has taken me all over the world ocean.
###32 From coral reefs in the tropics
###34 And the kelp forests off California
###37 to the frigid waters of Antarctica.
###41 I've studied life in the sea from some of the biggest fishes
###45 to some of the tiniest organisms in the drifting world of plankton.
###49 From this time underwater,
###52 I've come to see our planet through a new lens.
###56 We live on a water planet where 99%
###60 of the available living space lies in the ocean.
###64 All the water in our bodies,
###66 our eyes, our skin, our blood
###70 once resided in the ocean and will return one day to the sea.
###76 Water is the one element
###78 that connects us all so deeply-so profoundly.
###84 Here is where life began nearly 4 billion years ago and it's been honing
###89 its survival tactics ever since.
###93 We've explored less than 5% of this ancient realm.
###97 And now we're entering a true golden age of discovery in the ocean.
###103 Nearly 50% of the oxygen we breathe comes from hidden world of ocean microbes.
###110 Their intricate processes are crucial for life on Earth.
###117 I am constantly in awe of the ingenuity and tenacity of ocean life.
###122 How it manages to withstand the relentless
###125 and powerful energy of the waves,
###127 Extreme changes in temperature
###130 How so much diversity can thrive with nothing to latch on to,
###134 nowhere to hide.
###138 It's in these salty waters that I know the most profound secrets
###142 of the biological world still lie.
###146 If we can take care of the ocean and the life within,
###150 we can unlock the keys to so many more discoveries
###154 discoveries in science,
###156 medicine, food,
###159 energy...
###160 our own survival.
###163 As a biologist, explorer, filmmaker and mother,
###169 the ocean is the greatest gift I could ever ask for.
