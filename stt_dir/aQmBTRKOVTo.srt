0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:1,6



2
0:0:1,6 --> 0:0:2,85
PAUL LEE: My name is Paul Lee.


3
0:0:2,85 --> 0:0:4,952
And I'm a product
manager here at Google.


4
0:0:4,952 --> 0:0:6,66
For the past several
years, my wife and I


5
0:0:6,66 --> 0:0:8,4
have had the pleasure
of volunteering


6
0:0:8,4 --> 0:0:10,15
with the International
Justice Mission.


7
0:0:10,15 --> 0:0:12,79
And today, I am
privileged to introduce


8
0:0:12,79 --> 0:0:15,23
its founder and CEO Gary Haugen.


9
0:0:15,23 --> 0:0:18,1
So who is Gary Haugen?


10
0:0:18,1 --> 0:0:19,52
I didn't fact check this.


11
0:0:19,52 --> 0:0:21,49
So we'll go with this.


12
0:0:21,49 --> 0:0:24,43
This is what the
internet says Gary is.


13
0:0:24,43 --> 0:0:26,94
Gary is the youngest
of six kids and hails


14
0:0:26,94 --> 0:0:28,441
from nearby Sacramento.


15
0:0:28,441 --> 0:0:29,94
During elementary
school, he decided


16
0:0:29,94 --> 0:0:32,398
he want to be a lawyer, inspired
by the examples of Lincoln


17
0:0:32,398 --> 0:0:33,77
and MLK.


18
0:0:33,77 --> 0:0:36,1
He played football
in high school,


19
0:0:36,1 --> 0:0:37,79
with the scene crew
cut he generously


20
0:0:37,79 --> 0:0:39,48
shares with us today.


21
0:0:39,48 --> 0:0:42,18
And in 1981, he departed
for the lesser school


22
0:0:42,18 --> 0:0:44,1
in the East Coast, Harvard.


23
0:0:44,1 --> 0:0:48,9
After graduating in 1985,
Gary traveled to South Africa


24
0:0:48,9 --> 0:0:49,69
during the apartheid
era, and worked


25
0:0:49,69 --> 0:0:51,72
with Michael Cassidy
and Desmond Tutu


26
0:0:51,72 --> 0:0:55,26
at the National Initiative
for Reconciliation.


27
0:0:55,26 --> 0:0:57,2
For those of you who
were born in the '80s,


28
0:0:57,2 --> 0:0:59,33
this was during
the apartheid era.


29
0:0:59,33 --> 0:1:1,87
And as an example of what
it was like in that period,


30
0:1:1,87 --> 0:1:5,4
in one instance Gary was
detained by security forces


31
0:1:5,4 --> 0:1:6,9
for attending a
multiracial church


32
0:1:6,9 --> 0:1:8,76
service without permission.


33
0:1:8,76 --> 0:1:11,52
This was a world at that time.


34
0:1:11,52 --> 0:1:14,126
In 1988, Gary started law school
at the University of Chicago.


35
0:1:14,126 --> 0:1:16,5
And during that time, he worked
for the Lawyers Committee


36
0:1:16,5 --> 0:1:17,33
on Human Rights.


37
0:1:17,33 --> 0:1:20,84
He investigated crimes like
Lupeau Massacre of 1987,


38
0:1:20,84 --> 0:1:23,2
which involved the
execution of 17 civilians


39
0:1:23,2 --> 0:1:25,57
by soldiers in
the Filipino army.


40
0:1:25,57 --> 0:1:27,89
After law school, Gary joined
the Department of Justice


41
0:1:27,89 --> 0:1:30,402
as a trial attorney in
the Civil Rights Division.


42
0:1:30,402 --> 0:1:32,11
Gary met his wife,
Jan, during this time.


43
0:1:32,11 --> 0:1:33,75
They now have four kids.


44
0:1:33,75 --> 0:1:36,79
And in 1994, Gary was
detailed to the UN Center


45
0:1:36,79 --> 0:1:40,1
for Human Rights, where he
directed the UN's investigation


46
0:1:40,1 --> 0:1:42,7
of the genocide in Rwanda.


47
0:1:42,7 --> 0:1:44,54
I actually have on my
computer, but didn't


48
0:1:44,54 --> 0:1:47,665
send it to Ruthie in time,
a photo, my favorite photo


49
0:1:47,665 --> 0:1:49,4
that I've seen in
the IJM office.


50
0:1:49,4 --> 0:1:53,62
It's a picture of a
giant military camouflage


51
0:1:53,62 --> 0:1:57,17
helicopter in the
background, Gary


52
0:1:57,17 --> 0:1:59,61
dressed pretty much
like he is right now,


53
0:1:59,61 --> 0:2:2,63
and scores of kids
running towards him.


54
0:2:2,63 --> 0:2:4,3
And I asked the
staff there, what


55
0:2:4,3 --> 0:2:5,99
is that photo,
because it's just kick


56
0:2:5,99 --> 0:2:9,22
butt to see this giant
military transport and all


57
0:2:9,22 --> 0:2:10,479
these kids and Gary.


58
0:2:10,479 --> 0:2:13,99
It turns out that it was
from 2006, his first trip


59
0:2:13,99 --> 0:2:17,92
back to Rwanda where he
visited a remote area that


60
0:2:17,92 --> 0:2:19,88
was part of his investigation.


61
0:2:19,88 --> 0:2:24,46
That time was pivotal,
and if we go back to 1994,


62
0:2:24,46 --> 0:2:26,77
Gary, when he worked
for the investigation,


63
0:2:26,77 --> 0:2:30,3
collected with his team,
testimony of physical evidence


64
0:2:30,3 --> 0:2:32,6
from 100 mass
graves and massacre


65
0:2:32,6 --> 0:2:34,5
sites across the country.


66
0:2:34,5 --> 0:2:36,785
Allow me to share because I
can't do this justice, the "New


67
0:2:36,785 --> 0:2:38,91
Yorker" subscription as
experienced from an article


68
0:2:38,91 --> 0:2:41,52
they wrote about this in 2009.


69
0:2:41,52 --> 0:2:44,32
"Gary was sickened to come
across charred piles of bodies


70
0:2:44,32 --> 0:2:47,547
in a church where Tutsi had
expected to find sanctuary.


71
0:2:47,547 --> 0:2:49,13
He took down the
testimony of a father


72
0:2:49,13 --> 0:2:52,62
who saw his three small children
hacked to death with machetes.


73
0:2:52,62 --> 0:2:54,95
At one massacre site,
Haugen rolled back


74
0:2:54,95 --> 0:2:57,24
the decaying body of
a woman, and found


75
0:2:57,24 --> 0:2:59,3
the corpse of her
child beneath her."


76
0:2:59,3 --> 0:3:0,95
End quote.


77
0:3:0,95 --> 0:3:5,5
Over the next 17 years--
sorry, let me back up.


78
0:3:5,5 --> 0:3:8,3
Moved by this experience,
Gary returned to the US


79
0:3:8,3 --> 0:3:11,5
and went into start-up
planning mode.


80
0:3:11,5 --> 0:3:12,57
He would build a
new organization


81
0:3:12,57 --> 0:3:14,78
that would not simply
plead for victims,


82
0:3:14,78 --> 0:3:16,84
but would actually rescue them.


83
0:3:16,84 --> 0:3:19,71
This organization would
focus on four key areas.


84
0:3:19,71 --> 0:3:23,62
Victim relief, perpetrator
accountability, aftercare


85
0:3:23,62 --> 0:3:25,61
and structural reform.


86
0:3:25,61 --> 0:3:28,93
In 1997, one year prior
to Google's own start,


87
0:3:28,93 --> 0:3:31,7
Gary found IJM with
one employee, desks


88
0:3:31,7 --> 0:3:34,39
for two interns
in an office park.


89
0:3:34,39 --> 0:3:37,6
Over the next 17 years, IJM
would establish operations


90
0:3:37,6 --> 0:3:39,5
in 10 countries
and earn the right


91
0:3:39,5 --> 0:3:41,64
to investigate and
prosecute crimes,


92
0:3:41,64 --> 0:3:43,12
working with local
law enforcement


93
0:3:43,12 --> 0:3:44,91
and public prosecutors.


94
0:3:44,91 --> 0:3:47,73
You won't see these
videos, but I've seen them.


95
0:3:47,73 --> 0:3:51,2
And what you'll see if you were
actually at IJM headquarters


96
0:3:51,2 --> 0:3:52,96
is pictures of staff
putting their lives


97
0:3:52,96 --> 0:3:57,6
on the line in the back of
SWAT vans, raiding brothels,


98
0:3:57,6 --> 0:4:0,2
chasing out the aggressors
and rescuing the victims.


99
0:4:0,2 --> 0:4:2,54
It's a pretty
powerful experience.


100
0:4:2,54 --> 0:4:5,39
The organization now
includes 600 staff,


101
0:4:5,39 --> 0:4:6,89
including an
investigations team led


102
0:4:6,89 --> 0:4:10,39
by Mark Clookie, the former
director of NCIS-- yes, he


103
0:4:10,39 --> 0:4:14,78
did do two cameos on a TV show--
a policy team led by Holly


104
0:4:14,78 --> 0:4:17,95
Burkhalter, former advocacy
director for Human Rights


105
0:4:17,95 --> 0:4:21,5
Watch, as well as 200 lawyers.


106
0:4:21,5 --> 0:4:24,61
Today IJM is a $50 million
human rights agency


107
0:4:24,61 --> 0:4:27,76
that, in the words of the
"Atlantic"'s Stephen Bradley,


108
0:4:27,76 --> 0:4:32,62
investigates and prosecutes the
worst crimes, the worst evils,


109
0:4:32,62 --> 0:4:34,38
around the globe.


110
0:4:34,38 --> 0:4:37,65
Human trafficking, sexual
exploitation, slavery,


111
0:4:37,65 --> 0:4:41,17
police brutality, violence
in all manifestation


112
0:4:41,17 --> 0:4:45,194
but principally violence
against the world's poor.


113
0:4:45,194 --> 0:4:47,11
Over the last years,
I've served on the board.


114
0:4:47,11 --> 0:4:50,13
I've worked in my career
with over 40 non-profits.


115
0:4:50,13 --> 0:4:51,88
And some of these
non-profits are amazing.


116
0:4:51,88 --> 0:4:53,332
I think they do incredible work.


117
0:4:53,332 --> 0:4:55,54
This is the first time I
worked with a nonprofit that


118
0:4:55,54 --> 0:4:59,18
has as its dashboard monitoring
loss of life and limb


119
0:4:59,18 --> 0:5:3,23
to staff, tracking assassination
attempts on their staff workers


120
0:5:3,23 --> 0:5:4,15
in the field.


121
0:5:4,15 --> 0:5:6,68
The work they do is
really incredible.


122
0:5:6,68 --> 0:5:10,87
In 2013 alone, IJM
rescued over 2,000 victims


123
0:5:10,87 --> 0:5:13,26
and secured over
100 convictions.


124
0:5:13,26 --> 0:5:14,87
That's in one year.


125
0:5:14,87 --> 0:5:19,87
Over the past 18 years, IJM has
rescued over 18,000 victims,


126
0:5:19,87 --> 0:5:22,39
trained 13,000
officers and officials


127
0:5:22,39 --> 0:5:24,73
and secured over 700
convictions, much of them


128
0:5:24,73 --> 0:5:26,85
in the past five years alone.


129
0:5:26,85 --> 0:5:28,35
However, more
significant than these


130
0:5:28,35 --> 0:5:31,425
numbers is growing evidence
that IJM's model is beginning


131
0:5:31,425 --> 0:5:34,82
to result in structural
transformation and hopefully


132
0:5:34,82 --> 0:5:35,83
permanent change.


133
0:5:35,83 --> 0:5:38,474
A Gates Foundation-funded
study, for instance,


134
0:5:38,474 --> 0:5:40,89
found that the number of minors
available for exploitation


135
0:5:40,89 --> 0:5:46,99
in metro Ceba in the Philippines
plummeted 79% over four years.


136
0:5:46,99 --> 0:5:49,53
As a result of the
investigation's work in 2012,


137
0:5:49,53 --> 0:5:52,88
Gary received the Trafficking
In Persons Report Hero Reward.


138
0:5:52,88 --> 0:5:55,2
IJM was also one of
11 organizations that


139
0:5:55,2 --> 0:5:59,6
received a combined $11 million
grant from Google.org in 2011.


140
0:5:59,6 --> 0:6:2,5
A significant
portion of that grant


141
0:6:2,5 --> 0:6:5,2
was allocated to
syndicate IJM's model


142
0:6:5,2 --> 0:6:6,96
to other nonprofits in India.


143
0:6:6,96 --> 0:6:9,82
And in the first nine
months of 2013 alone,


144
0:6:9,82 --> 0:6:12,66
that initiative and your
money, Google's money,


145
0:6:12,66 --> 0:6:16,52
resulted in 830 victim rescues.


146
0:6:16,52 --> 0:6:18,64
Earlier this month,
Oxford University Press


147
0:6:18,64 --> 0:6:21,7
released Gary's latest
book "The Locust Effect:


148
0:6:21,7 --> 0:6:23,66
Why the End of Poverty
Requires the End of Violence,"


149
0:6:23,66 --> 0:6:25,826
written with Victor Boutros,
who's here in the front


150
0:6:25,826 --> 0:6:27,48
as well, federal prosecutor.


151
0:6:27,48 --> 0:6:29,62
Let me just say, amongst
the many endorsements


152
0:6:29,62 --> 0:6:31,73
that came from Bill Clinton,
Anne Marie Slaughter,


153
0:6:31,73 --> 0:6:33,64
Madeleine Albright,
I think my favorite


154
0:6:33,64 --> 0:6:35,97
is from Madeleine Albright
that says "the book is


155
0:6:35,97 --> 0:6:38,0
a much-needed argument
for reducing violence


156
0:6:38,0 --> 0:6:39,854
against the poor,
and a demonstration


157
0:6:39,854 --> 0:6:41,27
through firsthand
stories that are


158
0:6:41,27 --> 0:6:44,58
both shocking and true of
why that goal is so vital.


159
0:6:44,58 --> 0:6:47,7
The book is both a vehicle for
sharing voices rarely heard


160
0:6:47,7 --> 0:6:51,55
and a declaration of faith
that with sufficient will,


161
0:6:51,55 --> 0:6:54,53
there are ways to halt
the physical and financial


162
0:6:54,53 --> 0:6:57,2
exploitation of
the disadvantaged.


163
0:6:57,2 --> 0:6:59,68
By reminding us that basic
legal protections are not


164
0:6:59,68 --> 0:7:1,76
a privilege but a
universal right,


165
0:7:1,76 --> 0:7:3,42
Gary Haugen has
issued a moral call


166
0:7:3,42 --> 0:7:6,869
to arms that informs the
brain and touches the heart."


167
0:7:6,869 --> 0:7:9,16
That's my hope for us today,
that we'll keep our brains


168
0:7:9,16 --> 0:7:12,81
and our hearts open as we
welcome Gary to Google.


169
0:7:12,81 --> 0:7:14,316
Please join me.


170
0:7:14,316 --> 0:7:20,52
[APPLAUSE]


171
0:7:20,52 --> 0:7:23,24



172
0:7:23,24 --> 0:7:24,74
GARY HAUGEN: Thanks,
Paul, very much


173
0:7:24,74 --> 0:7:26,3
for the extravagant
introduction.


174
0:7:26,3 --> 0:7:29,22
I appreciate that you got
all the material from my mom,


175
0:7:29,22 --> 0:7:31,73
and you did a great,
great job with it.


176
0:7:31,73 --> 0:7:33,34
Thanks very much.


177
0:7:33,34 --> 0:7:37,57
And Kevin, thanks for dragging
all your friends here.


178
0:7:37,57 --> 0:7:40,5
He told me this is the
smartest people at Google.


179
0:7:40,5 --> 0:7:41,921
So congratulations for that.


180
0:7:41,921 --> 0:7:43,92
Or the people who couldn't
afford to buy a book,


181
0:7:43,92 --> 0:7:45,71
so the first 10 who
showed up got a book.


182
0:7:45,71 --> 0:7:49,32
So way to go.


183
0:7:49,32 --> 0:7:51,54
I'm glad you mentioned the hair.


184
0:7:51,54 --> 0:7:54,76
I did a Google
Hangout in New York,


185
0:7:54,76 --> 0:7:56,37
with your colleagues
in New York.


186
0:7:56,37 --> 0:7:57,57
And Justin introduced me.


187
0:7:57,57 --> 0:7:59,879
That pretty much was
the entire introduction


188
0:7:59,879 --> 0:8:1,17
was just making fun of my hair.


189
0:8:1,17 --> 0:8:4,835
So this was really
cool in the '50s.


190
0:8:4,835 --> 0:8:6,27
It really, really was.


191
0:8:6,27 --> 0:8:9,74
Anyways, it's marvelous
to get to be with you.


192
0:8:9,74 --> 0:8:13,8
Thank you for the
Google grant, that


193
0:8:13,8 --> 0:8:16,31
allowed us to replicate
the work in India.


194
0:8:16,31 --> 0:8:17,73
Thousands of people
now have been


195
0:8:17,73 --> 0:8:19,4
rescued as a result of that.


196
0:8:19,4 --> 0:8:21,4
I've been in places
of literal slavery


197
0:8:21,4 --> 0:8:23,52
and are now free because
of the willingness


198
0:8:23,52 --> 0:8:26,45
to engage in this work and to
train others in how to do it.


199
0:8:26,45 --> 0:8:29,49
But I'd like to start this
afternoon with a story much,


200
0:8:29,49 --> 0:8:32,44
much closer to home-- actually
just a few hours from here


201
0:8:32,44 --> 0:8:37,33
across the California border in
Oregon, in a rural county where


202
0:8:37,33 --> 0:8:39,5
there was a woman,
not too long ago,


203
0:8:39,5 --> 0:8:41,75
who was home alone at night.


204
0:8:41,75 --> 0:8:43,48
It's dark out.


205
0:8:43,48 --> 0:8:46,48
And she starts to
hear an intruder begin


206
0:8:46,48 --> 0:8:49,53
to break open her side door.


207
0:8:49,53 --> 0:8:53,31
And she looks over,
and sees this man


208
0:8:53,31 --> 0:8:55,87
breaking his way into her house.


209
0:8:55,87 --> 0:8:57,47
It's terrifying,
especially for her,


210
0:8:57,47 --> 0:9:0,78
because two weeks before,
this same man in her community


211
0:9:0,78 --> 0:9:3,57
had put her in the hospital
through an assault.


212
0:9:3,57 --> 0:9:7,62
And now he is clawing
his way into her house.


213
0:9:7,62 --> 0:9:9,85
So she does what any
sort of terrified person


214
0:9:9,85 --> 0:9:11,56
would do in their
house in America.


215
0:9:11,56 --> 0:9:15,1
She picks up the phone,
and she calls 911.


216
0:9:15,1 --> 0:9:20,13
And what proceeds is a pretty
horrific 10 minute conversation


217
0:9:20,13 --> 0:9:23,8
with this 911 operator
who proceeds to explain


218
0:9:23,8 --> 0:9:27,34
that due to budget cuts
in her rural county,


219
0:9:27,34 --> 0:9:31,73
law enforcement is only
operating on the weekdays.


220
0:9:31,73 --> 0:9:33,75
And this is a weekend.


221
0:9:33,75 --> 0:9:35,42
And so she's simply
explaining to her


222
0:9:35,42 --> 0:9:39,21
that you don't have law
enforcement in your area.


223
0:9:39,21 --> 0:9:40,998
Listen to this
for just a moment.


224
0:9:40,998 --> 0:9:41,664
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]


225
0:9:41,664 --> 0:9:45,41
-I don't have anybody
to send out there.


226
0:9:45,41 --> 0:9:49,94
Uh, you know, obviously if
he comes inside the residence


227
0:9:49,94 --> 0:9:51,93
and assaults you, can
you ask him to go away?


228
0:9:51,93 --> 0:9:54,34
Or do you know if he's
intoxicated or anything?


229
0:9:54,34 --> 0:9:55,34
-I've already asked him.


230
0:9:55,34 --> 0:9:56,707
I've already told him
I was calling you.


231
0:9:56,707 --> 0:9:59,814
He's broken in before, busted
down my door, assaulted me.


232
0:9:59,814 --> 0:10:0,77
-Uh huh.


233
0:10:0,77 --> 0:10:4,372
Is there any way you can
safely leave the residence?


234
0:10:4,372 --> 0:10:6,1
-No, I can't.


235
0:10:6,1 --> 0:10:8,264
Because he's blocking
pretty much my only way out.


236
0:10:8,264 --> 0:10:10,555
-Well, the only thing I can
do is give you some advice.


237
0:10:10,555 --> 0:10:13,455
And call the sheriff's
office tomorrow,


238
0:10:13,455 --> 0:10:19,3
Obviously, if he comes in and
unfortunately, has a weapon


239
0:10:19,3 --> 0:10:21,435
or is trying to cause
you physical harm,


240
0:10:21,435 --> 0:10:22,552
that's a different story.


241
0:10:22,552 --> 0:10:24,343
The sheriff's office
doesn't work up there.


242
0:10:24,343 --> 0:10:26,315
I don't have anybody to send.


243
0:10:26,315 --> 0:10:28,78
[END AUDIO PLAYBACK]


244
0:10:28,78 --> 0:10:31,36
GARY HAUGEN: The Sheriff's
office doesn't work up there.


245
0:10:31,36 --> 0:10:34,69
I don't have anybody to send.


246
0:10:34,69 --> 0:10:39,14
Of course, what happens is
that man tears into that place,


247
0:10:39,14 --> 0:10:43,61
assaults her, chokes
her, brutally rapes her.


248
0:10:43,61 --> 0:10:46,84
This is what happens
if there's no law


249
0:10:46,84 --> 0:10:52,3
enforcement in your area, if
there's no one to send for you.


250
0:10:52,3 --> 0:10:54,9
And yet, this book
that we've written,


251
0:10:54,9 --> 0:10:56,18
"The Locust Effect,"
what this is about


252
0:10:56,18 --> 0:10:58,88
is the story that there are
about four billion people


253
0:10:58,88 --> 0:11:2,9
in our world who have no
access to law enforcement.


254
0:11:2,9 --> 0:11:4,71
Especially for those
who are poorest,


255
0:11:4,71 --> 0:11:8,79
a study was done by the UN that
says quote-- listen to this--


256
0:11:8,79 --> 0:11:14,385
"most poor people live outside
the protection of law."


257
0:11:14,385 --> 0:11:16,1
Now that's a phrase
that we can sort of


258
0:11:16,1 --> 0:11:18,66
read and just let wash over us.


259
0:11:18,66 --> 0:11:20,44
But I think there's perhaps
nothing quite like this phone


260
0:11:20,44 --> 0:11:22,59
call that allows us
for just a moment


261
0:11:22,59 --> 0:11:25,73
to step into the shoes
of the common poor person


262
0:11:25,73 --> 0:11:28,34
in the developing world
who has no access to law


263
0:11:28,34 --> 0:11:32,919
enforcement and the terror that
that represents in their lives.


264
0:11:32,919 --> 0:11:33,96
So that's the big number.


265
0:11:33,96 --> 0:11:36,52
Four billion people
do not have access


266
0:11:36,52 --> 0:11:38,595
to law enforcement
that will actually


267
0:11:38,595 --> 0:11:39,72
protect them from violence.


268
0:11:39,72 --> 0:11:42,94
But what does that actually look
like in the developing world?


269
0:11:42,94 --> 0:11:44,91
Well, it looks like
this in Bolivia,


270
0:11:44,91 --> 0:11:47,34
where if you were
to sexually assault


271
0:11:47,34 --> 0:11:49,76
a child in Bolivia,
statistically,


272
0:11:49,76 --> 0:11:52,78
you would actually be at greater
risk of slipping in the shower


273
0:11:52,78 --> 0:11:54,54
and dying than you
would have ever


274
0:11:54,54 --> 0:11:57,77
being sent to jail
for that crime.


275
0:11:57,77 --> 0:12:0,3
Imagine a state of
such impunity-- yes,


276
0:12:0,3 --> 0:12:2,26
it's completely against the law.


277
0:12:2,26 --> 0:12:5,17
But the problem for the poor is
not that they don't get laws,


278
0:12:5,17 --> 0:12:7,98
it's they don't get
law enforcement.


279
0:12:7,98 --> 0:12:12,22
This means, in India and
other places in South Asia,


280
0:12:12,22 --> 0:12:17,73
if you enslave someone,
literally enslave someone,


281
0:12:17,73 --> 0:12:20,23
you're at greater risk of being
struck by lightning than you


282
0:12:20,23 --> 0:12:25,88
are of ever being sent to
jail for the crime of slavery.


283
0:12:25,88 --> 0:12:30,4
This is a profound
and massive phenomenon


284
0:12:30,4 --> 0:12:33,27
across the developing world
that receives very, very


285
0:12:33,27 --> 0:12:36,52
little mention at all,
which is the utter breakdown


286
0:12:36,52 --> 0:12:38,95
of basic criminal justice
systems in the developing


287
0:12:38,95 --> 0:12:39,45
world.


288
0:12:39,45 --> 0:12:43,5
And what it has done, then,
is unleash this epidemic


289
0:12:43,5 --> 0:12:45,67
of violence against the poor.


290
0:12:45,67 --> 0:12:47,42
And in "The Locust
Effect," this is really


291
0:12:47,42 --> 0:12:49,169
what we're trying to
bring to the surface.


292
0:12:49,169 --> 0:12:51,8
Because if I say the
word global poverty


293
0:12:51,8 --> 0:12:54,2
and if you try to bring
sort of images to mind,


294
0:12:54,2 --> 0:12:55,3
what comes to mind?


295
0:12:55,3 --> 0:12:56,62
I mean immediately
you start to think,


296
0:12:56,62 --> 0:12:58,41
don't you, about dirty shacks.


297
0:12:58,41 --> 0:13:0,29
You think about the dirty water.


298
0:13:0,29 --> 0:13:1,37
You think of sickness.


299
0:13:1,37 --> 0:13:4,76
You think of kids who
can't go to school.


300
0:13:4,76 --> 0:13:8,26
You think of lack of capital,
the need for microfinance,


301
0:13:8,26 --> 0:13:9,87
all those sorts of needs.


302
0:13:9,87 --> 0:13:12,5
One of the things that does not
commonly come to the surface


303
0:13:12,5 --> 0:13:15,14
for us is the way
that to be poor


304
0:13:15,14 --> 0:13:18,97
is to be chronically
vulnerable to violence.


305
0:13:18,97 --> 0:13:20,56
But the problem is
all that violence


306
0:13:20,56 --> 0:13:22,7
stays below the surface.


307
0:13:22,7 --> 0:13:24,8
Many of us have traveled
to the developing world.


308
0:13:24,8 --> 0:13:27,63
And we've seen the dirty shacks,
the dirty water, the hunger,


309
0:13:27,63 --> 0:13:29,4
the people who are sick.


310
0:13:29,4 --> 0:13:32,18
But very few of us will ever
just visually see the violence.


311
0:13:32,18 --> 0:13:35,61
And so it takes something
for us to be traveling


312
0:13:35,61 --> 0:13:38,11
into that subterranean
world to see


313
0:13:38,11 --> 0:13:39,36
what that violence looks like.


314
0:13:39,36 --> 0:13:41,33
And this is what we try
to do in the opening


315
0:13:41,33 --> 0:13:44,6
chapters of "The Locust
Effect" is take you


316
0:13:44,6 --> 0:13:46,14
with a common poor person
in the developing world


317
0:13:46,14 --> 0:13:47,57
to see what this
violence is like.


318
0:13:47,57 --> 0:13:50,82
And we begin with
the first category


319
0:13:50,82 --> 0:13:53,781
of most pervasive violence
among the poor in the developing


320
0:13:53,781 --> 0:13:54,28
world.


321
0:13:54,28 --> 0:13:56,96
And that's basically
gender violence.


322
0:13:56,96 --> 0:13:59,72
That's sexual violence
and domestic abuse


323
0:13:59,72 --> 0:14:1,2
of women and girls.


324
0:14:1,2 --> 0:14:3,52
It is, in the collapse
of law enforcement,


325
0:14:3,52 --> 0:14:5,99
open season on women and girls.


326
0:14:5,99 --> 0:14:8,16
In fact, gender
violence accounts


327
0:14:8,16 --> 0:14:12,13
for more death and disability
for women and girls


328
0:14:12,13 --> 0:14:15,63
between the age of 15 and
44 than malaria, cancer, car


329
0:14:15,63 --> 0:14:19,57
accidents and war combined.


330
0:14:19,57 --> 0:14:23,784
This is why we're calling this
epidemic "every day violence,"


331
0:14:23,784 --> 0:14:25,95
because, again, if we are
familiar with the violence


332
0:14:25,95 --> 0:14:27,366
against the poor,
most of the time


333
0:14:27,366 --> 0:14:30,67
we're thinking about the sort of
catastrophic spasms of violence


334
0:14:30,67 --> 0:14:32,25
that are in the headlines.


335
0:14:32,25 --> 0:14:34,92
Like the wars, the
conflicts, and for sure,


336
0:14:34,92 --> 0:14:37,19
those do decimate
people's lives.


337
0:14:37,19 --> 0:14:39,7
And I know something about
that myself, of course,


338
0:14:39,7 --> 0:14:42,65
having been the director of
the genocide investigation


339
0:14:42,65 --> 0:14:45,13
in Rwanda where,
as Paul mentioned,


340
0:14:45,13 --> 0:14:48,91
I just was given this list by
UN military intelligence of 100


341
0:14:48,91 --> 0:14:51,49
different mass graves
and massacre sites.


342
0:14:51,49 --> 0:14:54,26
And we just tediously sorted
through these thousands


343
0:14:54,26 --> 0:14:56,69
and thousands of
people who'd been


344
0:14:56,69 --> 0:14:59,86
butchered by their neighbors.


345
0:14:59,86 --> 0:15:1,7
And when you're doing
that work, especially


346
0:15:1,7 --> 0:15:3,824
as an investigator, what
you're really trying to do


347
0:15:3,824 --> 0:15:6,33
is recreate visually
how did this happen


348
0:15:6,33 --> 0:15:8,32
from the forensic
evidence that's there.


349
0:15:8,32 --> 0:15:10,9
And what is it like for
that family pressed up


350
0:15:10,9 --> 0:15:14,12
against the wall of that
stadium or that school


351
0:15:14,12 --> 0:15:17,1
or that cathedral, as they
see those machetes coming


352
0:15:17,1 --> 0:15:18,8
towards them?


353
0:15:18,8 --> 0:15:21,53
And the thing that
was so manifest to me


354
0:15:21,53 --> 0:15:23,98
is that, yes, all these
Rwandans were overwhelmingly


355
0:15:23,98 --> 0:15:25,3
very, very poor.


356
0:15:25,3 --> 0:15:29,52
The average Rwandan is
living off about $0.65 a day.


357
0:15:29,52 --> 0:15:32,856
But in that moment of
terror, when the machetes


358
0:15:32,856 --> 0:15:34,48
are coming towards
you and your family,


359
0:15:34,48 --> 0:15:37,2
you're actually not
crying out for some food.


360
0:15:37,2 --> 0:15:38,917
You're not crying
out for a doctor.


361
0:15:38,917 --> 0:15:40,5
You're not crying
out for a microloan.


362
0:15:40,5 --> 0:15:44,12
You're not crying out for
a teacher in education.


363
0:15:44,12 --> 0:15:45,96
You're crying out for
someone to restrain


364
0:15:45,96 --> 0:15:48,23
the hand of that machete.


365
0:15:48,23 --> 0:15:52,3
And this is the thing that
makes violence different.


366
0:15:52,3 --> 0:15:55,71
It is a profound
affliction of the poor,


367
0:15:55,71 --> 0:15:58,41
but it's different than the
other problems that we engage.


368
0:15:58,41 --> 0:16:1,7
And this first category
of massive abuse


369
0:16:1,7 --> 0:16:2,28
is gender violence.


370
0:16:2,28 --> 0:16:5,19
But like so many things,
it stays below the surface.


371
0:16:5,19 --> 0:16:7,28
At the beginning
of the book, I just


372
0:16:7,28 --> 0:16:9,77
invite readers to come with
me to meet Lucilla who's


373
0:16:9,77 --> 0:16:13,49
this woman that I met in a small
town in the Andean mountains


374
0:16:13,49 --> 0:16:14,492
in Peru.


375
0:16:14,492 --> 0:16:16,7
Very common woman, lives in
a town that you would not


376
0:16:16,7 --> 0:16:20,34
necessarily notice or
pay any attention to,


377
0:16:20,34 --> 0:16:24,37
except for the fact it has
a rate of sexual assault


378
0:16:24,37 --> 0:16:27,8
that is worse than the sexual
assault rates that were coming


379
0:16:27,8 --> 0:16:30,52
out of the worst war
zones of the Congo.


380
0:16:30,52 --> 0:16:32,76
And if you follow through
the story of Lucilla


381
0:16:32,76 --> 0:16:35,6
as she has to endure
the rape and murder


382
0:16:35,6 --> 0:16:38,1
of her eight-year-old
daughter, who's just dumped out


383
0:16:38,1 --> 0:16:40,31
on the street one night.


384
0:16:40,31 --> 0:16:42,94
And to follow Lucilla in
what it is like for her


385
0:16:42,94 --> 0:16:46,92
to try to get justice in a
totally broken criminal justice


386
0:16:46,92 --> 0:16:49,26
system.


387
0:16:49,26 --> 0:16:52,83
Gender violence is
this massive epidemic


388
0:16:52,83 --> 0:16:55,57
against women and girls who
are poorest and most vulnerable


389
0:16:55,57 --> 0:16:56,34
in the world.


390
0:16:56,34 --> 0:16:59,76
The second massive category
of violence against the poor


391
0:16:59,76 --> 0:17:1,64
is a kind of violence
that actually


392
0:17:1,64 --> 0:17:5,15
keeps people in poverty by
force, and that's slavery.


393
0:17:5,15 --> 0:17:8,89
You may already know that there
are about 30 million people


394
0:17:8,89 --> 0:17:12,1
held in slavery in
the world today.


395
0:17:12,1 --> 0:17:14,95
These are not people held
in slave-like conditions


396
0:17:14,95 --> 0:17:18,5
or metaphorical slavery--
in actual slavery.


397
0:17:18,5 --> 0:17:20,97
At IJM, we've met
thousands of them.


398
0:17:20,97 --> 0:17:22,589
And thanks to
Google's work with us


399
0:17:22,589 --> 0:17:25,5
have also been able to
bring rescue to thousands.


400
0:17:25,5 --> 0:17:27,63
But there remain
actually more people


401
0:17:27,63 --> 0:17:32,78
in slavery today than in any
other time in human history.


402
0:17:32,78 --> 0:17:34,54
Mind boggling, right?


403
0:17:34,54 --> 0:17:37,12
It's true that a smaller
proportion of human beings


404
0:17:37,12 --> 0:17:37,89
are in slavery.


405
0:17:37,89 --> 0:17:38,92
That's true.


406
0:17:38,92 --> 0:17:40,74
A smaller proportion
of the economy


407
0:17:40,74 --> 0:17:42,2
is produced by slave labor.


408
0:17:42,2 --> 0:17:42,52
That's true.


409
0:17:42,52 --> 0:17:44,93
But there's just so
many more human beings


410
0:17:44,93 --> 0:17:47,7
that the absolute number
of people in slavery


411
0:17:47,7 --> 0:17:50,38
is greater now than any
other time in history.


412
0:17:50,38 --> 0:17:52,72
One of the ways we try to
bring readers into this again


413
0:17:52,72 --> 0:17:55,39
subterranean reality
is to take people


414
0:17:55,39 --> 0:17:59,18
to Bangalore, which is sort of
the shining high-tech capital


415
0:17:59,18 --> 0:18:3,86
in India, really sort of the
icon of the booming economies


416
0:18:3,86 --> 0:18:5,16
of India.


417
0:18:5,16 --> 0:18:8,5
But an Indian lawyer takes me
on a drive just a few minutes


418
0:18:8,5 --> 0:18:10,39
outside the beltway
of Bangalore and shows


419
0:18:10,39 --> 0:18:12,13
me a brick factory
where scores of people


420
0:18:12,13 --> 0:18:15,16
are held literally as slaves
working seven days a week,


421
0:18:15,16 --> 0:18:18,7
12 to 14 hours a day,
making and carrying bricks.


422
0:18:18,7 --> 0:18:20,45
And anybody's who's
ever tried to run away


423
0:18:20,45 --> 0:18:22,19
from the facility
is chased down,


424
0:18:22,19 --> 0:18:24,17
dragged back and beaten
in front of the others.


425
0:18:24,17 --> 0:18:28,157
In fact, when this one
couple was able to escape,


426
0:18:28,157 --> 0:18:30,74
the owner of the brick factory
was able to go to their village


427
0:18:30,74 --> 0:18:33,91
and actually kidnap and
hold some family members


428
0:18:33,91 --> 0:18:36,78
and neighbors as
hostages, and just


429
0:18:36,78 --> 0:18:39,39
publicly proclaim until you
bring me back my slaves,


430
0:18:39,39 --> 0:18:44,47
I'm going to continue to detain
and torture their neighbors.


431
0:18:44,47 --> 0:18:47,437
In other words, he was
very happy to let everyone


432
0:18:47,437 --> 0:18:49,52
know that he was exercising
this kind of violence,


433
0:18:49,52 --> 0:18:52,6
because he had zero
fear that he would ever


434
0:18:52,6 --> 0:18:55,35
be brought to account
under the law.


435
0:18:55,35 --> 0:18:58,3
So I got a chance to sit
with Mariamam for instance,


436
0:18:58,3 --> 0:19:1,1
as she explained what
it was like to live


437
0:19:1,1 --> 0:19:4,3
as a slave with her
family and about two dozen


438
0:19:4,3 --> 0:19:7,2
other over of her
neighbors as literal slaves


439
0:19:7,2 --> 0:19:10,41
in the 21st century.


440
0:19:10,41 --> 0:19:13,44
So the book takes us again
to that subterranean world


441
0:19:13,44 --> 0:19:16,93
that we would otherwise
have no idea about.


442
0:19:16,93 --> 0:19:18,8
The third sort of
catastrophic form


443
0:19:18,8 --> 0:19:21,29
of violence against the
poor, surprisingly perhaps,


444
0:19:21,29 --> 0:19:24,4
is police abuse.


445
0:19:24,4 --> 0:19:26,74
It turns out that
the World Bank did


446
0:19:26,74 --> 0:19:28,71
this study called
"Voices of the Poor"


447
0:19:28,71 --> 0:19:31,34
which gave to the tens of
thousands of poor people


448
0:19:31,34 --> 0:19:34,4
just the chance to say what is
it about your poverty that's


449
0:19:34,4 --> 0:19:36,28
most painful to you.


450
0:19:36,28 --> 0:19:38,14
And the study was
very rigorous, and one


451
0:19:38,14 --> 0:19:44,1
of things it was
saying that police


452
0:19:44,1 --> 0:19:46,17
and courts in the
developing world


453
0:19:46,17 --> 0:19:50,91
actually make poor people
poorer and less secure.


454
0:19:50,91 --> 0:19:51,845
What?


455
0:19:51,845 --> 0:19:53,22
I mean that's like
a finding that


456
0:19:53,22 --> 0:19:55,13
says the hospitals in
the developing world


457
0:19:55,13 --> 0:19:56,94
are making everybody sicker.


458
0:19:56,94 --> 0:19:58,82
Or the schools are
actually the places


459
0:19:58,82 --> 0:20:1,76
where everyone's
prohibited from reading.


460
0:20:1,76 --> 0:20:3,29
This is what public
justice systems


461
0:20:3,29 --> 0:20:5,18
have become in the
developing world--


462
0:20:5,18 --> 0:20:6,49
places actually of harm.


463
0:20:6,49 --> 0:20:8,96
If you're poor, you run away
from the police to be safe.


464
0:20:8,96 --> 0:20:12,13
You don't run to the
police to be safe.


465
0:20:12,13 --> 0:20:13,55
One of the
manifestations of this


466
0:20:13,55 --> 0:20:17,62
is the reality of pretrial
detention, where the police are


467
0:20:17,62 --> 0:20:20,4
able to throw people
into jails and hold them


468
0:20:20,4 --> 0:20:22,5
without any charge or trial.


469
0:20:22,5 --> 0:20:25,47
In any given year, there's
about 10 million people,


470
0:20:25,47 --> 0:20:28,46
overwhelmingly the poorest, who
are held in pretrial detention.


471
0:20:28,46 --> 0:20:30,307
What you don't see in
that statistic though,


472
0:20:30,307 --> 0:20:31,89
that of the tens of
millions of people


473
0:20:31,89 --> 0:20:34,44
who are attached to
those families, when


474
0:20:34,44 --> 0:20:36,74
the breadwinner is
taken into prison,


475
0:20:36,74 --> 0:20:39,66
the way that devastates
the capacity of that family


476
0:20:39,66 --> 0:20:41,17
to move forward.


477
0:20:41,17 --> 0:20:45,91
So police abuse is the
third and just horrific form


478
0:20:45,91 --> 0:20:47,78
of violence
confronting the poor.


479
0:20:47,78 --> 0:20:52,4
The fourth, interestingly,
is violent land theft.


480
0:20:52,4 --> 0:20:55,2
Just a way that the poor
will have their land stolen


481
0:20:55,2 --> 0:20:57,69
from them by people
of power and violence.


482
0:20:57,69 --> 0:21:1,64
In any given year,
about 5 million people


483
0:21:1,64 --> 0:21:5,505
will get themselves violently
ejected off of their land.


484
0:21:5,505 --> 0:21:6,88
And if you were
to look at, well,


485
0:21:6,88 --> 0:21:8,42
who's most vulnerable
to this, it


486
0:21:8,42 --> 0:21:11,81
turns out that widows are,
especially widows in Africa.


487
0:21:11,81 --> 0:21:13,56
As the AIDS epidemic
has devastated


488
0:21:13,56 --> 0:21:17,44
much of the male population, it
leaves these families, right?


489
0:21:17,44 --> 0:21:20,16
And what happens is that
stronger families will come


490
0:21:20,16 --> 0:21:23,27
and they'll just throw a
widow like Susan and her kids


491
0:21:23,27 --> 0:21:25,15
off their land.


492
0:21:25,15 --> 0:21:28,59
One of the things that's amazing
that I had no understanding of


493
0:21:28,59 --> 0:21:33,4
was the idea that widows like
Susan in the developing world


494
0:21:33,4 --> 0:21:36,279
support a half a
billion orphans.


495
0:21:36,279 --> 0:21:38,7
So you imagine a poor
person who their sort


496
0:21:38,7 --> 0:21:40,7
of one asset for
moving out of poverty


497
0:21:40,7 --> 0:21:42,21
is their little plot of
land, which gives them


498
0:21:42,21 --> 0:21:45,54
a little shelter and then also
the little garden where they're


499
0:21:45,54 --> 0:21:46,54
able to raise some food.


500
0:21:46,54 --> 0:21:49,83
But if you steal that
land away, you've


501
0:21:49,83 --> 0:21:55,22
taken a very most basic means
for progress away from them.


502
0:21:55,22 --> 0:21:57,64
And you've left
them in destitution.


503
0:21:57,64 --> 0:22:0,8
So that's the fourth
largest pervasive form


504
0:22:0,8 --> 0:22:4,365
of violence against the
poor is violent land theft.


505
0:22:4,365 --> 0:22:8,52



506
0:22:8,52 --> 0:22:11,45
The things that we want to
bring forth from the book


507
0:22:11,45 --> 0:22:14,41
is not only this sort of
subterranean world of violence


508
0:22:14,41 --> 0:22:18,32
that we might not be aware of--
and why aren't we aware of it?


509
0:22:18,32 --> 0:22:20,41
It's hard to visualize--
but secondly, there's


510
0:22:20,41 --> 0:22:23,31
human beings actively hiding it.


511
0:22:23,31 --> 0:22:26,34
Dirty water does not
actively hide itself.


512
0:22:26,34 --> 0:22:29,62
Nor do shacks nor generally
do diseases, but human beings


513
0:22:29,62 --> 0:22:32,53
when they commit violence,
they work hard to hide it.


514
0:22:32,53 --> 0:22:34,62
And likewise, the
survivors and victims


515
0:22:34,62 --> 0:22:37,65
of abuse also because of
fear and shame many times


516
0:22:37,65 --> 0:22:39,26
are also hiding it as well.


517
0:22:39,26 --> 0:22:41,85
So the book is trying to bring
this back up to the surface.


518
0:22:41,85 --> 0:22:44,65
But not only that,
but help people


519
0:22:44,65 --> 0:22:47,75
begin to think about what
are the implications of this


520
0:22:47,75 --> 0:22:49,89
for our dreams for
the poor, that is,


521
0:22:49,89 --> 0:22:52,592
that they would be able
to get out of poverty.


522
0:22:52,592 --> 0:22:54,8
And this is why we're calling
it "The Locust Effect,"


523
0:22:54,8 --> 0:22:57,12
because one of the pictures
we want people to have


524
0:22:57,12 --> 0:23:1,829
is just the way that
over the millennia,


525
0:23:1,829 --> 0:23:3,62
these poor farm
communities, who are trying


526
0:23:3,62 --> 0:23:6,53
to scrape their way out of
poverty by all this farm work,


527
0:23:6,53 --> 0:23:10,9
in a single day would
see the locusts descend


528
0:23:10,9 --> 0:23:13,2
and just destroy
all of those years


529
0:23:13,2 --> 0:23:14,5
of hard work in a single day.


530
0:23:14,5 --> 0:23:16,22
And this is the way
predatory violence


531
0:23:16,22 --> 0:23:17,92
works in the life of the poor.


532
0:23:17,92 --> 0:23:22,59
In a moment, they descend
and destroy that work.


533
0:23:22,59 --> 0:23:25,14
But not only did it destroy
the fruit of the farm work,


534
0:23:25,14 --> 0:23:27,63
but what's interesting
about the locust is


535
0:23:27,63 --> 0:23:31,44
that farm work doesn't
stop the locust.


536
0:23:31,44 --> 0:23:33,33
So not only does
violence destroy


537
0:23:33,33 --> 0:23:35,79
the fruit of the
efforts of the poor


538
0:23:35,79 --> 0:23:38,97
and the efforts of those
who attempt to help them,


539
0:23:38,97 --> 0:23:42,17
but also the traditional things
that we do to assist the poor,


540
0:23:42,17 --> 0:23:44,31
they don't stop the violence.


541
0:23:44,31 --> 0:23:45,94
So that suggests
that we need to start


542
0:23:45,94 --> 0:23:48,58
talking about
poverty differently


543
0:23:48,58 --> 0:23:51,11
and start doing things
differently about poverty


544
0:23:51,11 --> 0:23:52,75
as well.


545
0:23:52,75 --> 0:23:54,82
So then that raises
the question that we


546
0:23:54,82 --> 0:23:57,68
try to address a bit in
the book is my goodness,


547
0:23:57,68 --> 0:24:1,58
why are criminal justice
systems so completely useless,


548
0:24:1,58 --> 0:24:4,64
backwards, brutal and broken
in the developing world?


549
0:24:4,64 --> 0:24:7,31
And there is four pretty
interesting surprises


550
0:24:7,31 --> 0:24:8,31
that explain this.


551
0:24:8,31 --> 0:24:11,44
One of them, which if you
traveled in the developing


552
0:24:11,44 --> 0:24:15,267
world you probably noticed,
but it didn't really


553
0:24:15,267 --> 0:24:17,35
come to your mind what it
was that you are seeing.


554
0:24:17,35 --> 0:24:20,57
And that is, you probably went
to a restaurant and a hotel,


555
0:24:20,57 --> 0:24:22,279
and you exchanged
some money, and you


556
0:24:22,279 --> 0:24:24,57
went to some other places,
novels and almost everywhere


557
0:24:24,57 --> 0:24:26,81
that you and I would go
in the developing world,


558
0:24:26,81 --> 0:24:31,2
someone will be there
with a gun guarding you.


559
0:24:31,2 --> 0:24:34,23
Because with the collapse
of public justice systems


560
0:24:34,23 --> 0:24:37,78
in the developing world,
what's come into its place?


561
0:24:37,78 --> 0:24:40,65
Well, people with wealth
and money and businesses


562
0:24:40,65 --> 0:24:42,77
have set up a completely
parallel system


563
0:24:42,77 --> 0:24:45,6
of private security.


564
0:24:45,6 --> 0:24:48,5
So now, in fact, in a
country like Guatemala,


565
0:24:48,5 --> 0:24:50,88
private security forces
are seven times larger


566
0:24:50,88 --> 0:24:54,38
than the public police force.


567
0:24:54,38 --> 0:24:58,7
In Africa, the largest
employer on the continent


568
0:24:58,7 --> 0:25:0,49
is private security.


569
0:25:0,49 --> 0:25:3,87
In a way that almost we have
not remarked upon at all,


570
0:25:3,87 --> 0:25:6,42
a massive social
transformation has taken place


571
0:25:6,42 --> 0:25:9,64
in the developing world, where
security, instead of it being


572
0:25:9,64 --> 0:25:12,67
a public good that's
provided to everybody


573
0:25:12,67 --> 0:25:16,14
through public institutions of
policing and criminal justice


574
0:25:16,14 --> 0:25:18,52
system has been privatized.


575
0:25:18,52 --> 0:25:21,42
So now there's two kinds of
people in the developing world.


576
0:25:21,42 --> 0:25:24,67
Those who can pay for their own
security and those who cannot


577
0:25:24,67 --> 0:25:27,88
afford to pay for security,
cannot pay to be safe,


578
0:25:27,88 --> 0:25:29,41
and so they're not.


579
0:25:29,41 --> 0:25:35,92
So we now have to picture 2 and
1/2 billion people who live off


580
0:25:35,92 --> 0:25:39,37
less than $2 a day, who
cannot purchase into their own


581
0:25:39,37 --> 0:25:42,75
security and are living
in this lawless chaos.


582
0:25:42,75 --> 0:25:47,6
What is the impact for them on
trying to get out of poverty?


583
0:25:47,6 --> 0:25:48,77
There's several
other explanations


584
0:25:48,77 --> 0:25:51,13
in the book that are
pretty surprising about how


585
0:25:51,13 --> 0:25:54,96
it is that criminal justice
systems and law enforcement has


586
0:25:54,96 --> 0:25:57,199
become so broken in
the developing world.


587
0:25:57,199 --> 0:25:58,74
But then what we
try to do is finally


588
0:25:58,74 --> 0:26:1,33
sort of pivot towards
some hope, because I


589
0:26:1,33 --> 0:26:4,14
realize I've pretty much
decimated your Wednesday


590
0:26:4,14 --> 0:26:7,91
right here that was going
along very well just fine.


591
0:26:7,91 --> 0:26:10,22
And then we hear about
all this massive violence


592
0:26:10,22 --> 0:26:11,11
and human suffering.


593
0:26:11,11 --> 0:26:13,9
It's like, thank
you very much, Gary.


594
0:26:13,9 --> 0:26:16,8
I'll take a nap now.


595
0:26:16,8 --> 0:26:20,43
But we've been at this work
now for almost 20 years.


596
0:26:20,43 --> 0:26:22,73
And you think we'd be pretty
much in a fetal position


597
0:26:22,73 --> 0:26:25,94
somewhere, because of all the
sort of overwhelming corruption


598
0:26:25,94 --> 0:26:27,68
and abuse and violence.


599
0:26:27,68 --> 0:26:30,6
But actually I have never
been and we've never


600
0:26:30,6 --> 0:26:33,17
been more hopeful about
coming to a tipping


601
0:26:33,17 --> 0:26:36,54
point of transformation
in the developing world.


602
0:26:36,54 --> 0:26:37,48
And why is that?


603
0:26:37,48 --> 0:26:38,94
Where is the hope come from?


604
0:26:38,94 --> 0:26:42,49
The first place that hope
comes from is history.


605
0:26:42,49 --> 0:26:43,99
Most of us just
have never thought


606
0:26:43,99 --> 0:26:47,79
for a few minutes of like,
where did our own reasonably


607
0:26:47,79 --> 0:26:50,48
functioning public
justice systems come from?


608
0:26:50,48 --> 0:26:52,5
Our public justice system,
our police and courts


609
0:26:52,5 --> 0:26:53,87
aren't perfect, for sure.


610
0:26:53,87 --> 0:26:56,6
I spent a career at the
Department of Justice


611
0:26:56,6 --> 0:27:0,1
going after corrupt and brutal
cops in the United States.


612
0:27:0,1 --> 0:27:2,83
And my co-author Victor
d does this currently


613
0:27:2,83 --> 0:27:4,413
and works in the
Civil Rights Division


614
0:27:4,413 --> 0:27:6,26
of the Department of Justice.


615
0:27:6,26 --> 0:27:9,32
All the sort of abuses that
happen anywhere in the world


616
0:27:9,32 --> 0:27:11,8
can also happen here.


617
0:27:11,8 --> 0:27:17,14
But we breathe, like the
invisible oxygen in the air,


618
0:27:17,14 --> 0:27:19,78
functioning criminal justice
systems that keep us safe.


619
0:27:19,78 --> 0:27:22,56
So we are outraged, are
we not, when it turns out


620
0:27:22,56 --> 0:27:25,62
that law enforcement can't
come to my house right now.


621
0:27:25,62 --> 0:27:28,29
That seems like a completely
intolerable situation.


622
0:27:28,29 --> 0:27:31,57
Because we have reasonably
functioning justice systems.


623
0:27:31,57 --> 0:27:33,96
But if you lived in
the San Francisco Bay


624
0:27:33,96 --> 0:27:39,17
Area 120 years ago, what
kind of law enforcement


625
0:27:39,17 --> 0:27:40,886
would you be experiencing?


626
0:27:40,886 --> 0:27:42,26
What I could tell
you for sure is


627
0:27:42,26 --> 0:27:45,36
that it would be either
non-existent brutal or corrupt


628
0:27:45,36 --> 0:27:47,4
or completely
captured by whatever


629
0:27:47,4 --> 0:27:49,539
local political
party was in charge.


630
0:27:49,539 --> 0:27:51,8
In fact, what we do
in the book is we


631
0:27:51,8 --> 0:27:53,66
set forth these various
examples, these scenarios,


632
0:27:53,66 --> 0:27:54,99
and have you try to guess.


633
0:27:54,99 --> 0:27:59,1
Is this one of the familiar
cities that you enjoy and walk


634
0:27:59,1 --> 0:28:1,78
in currently and a story of
what their public justice


635
0:28:1,78 --> 0:28:4,4
system looked like
140 years ago?


636
0:28:4,4 --> 0:28:7,24
Or is this a current city
in the developing world?


637
0:28:7,24 --> 0:28:11,73
And the descriptions are
indistinguishable, one


638
0:28:11,73 --> 0:28:12,86
from another.


639
0:28:12,86 --> 0:28:15,99
In other words, criminal justice
systems that work and protect


640
0:28:15,99 --> 0:28:17,71
people, they don't
descend from heaven


641
0:28:17,71 --> 0:28:19,55
as wonderfully operating.


642
0:28:19,55 --> 0:28:22,75
They always start out
brutal and corrupt.


643
0:28:22,75 --> 0:28:28,0
And a fight is engaged to make
them actually serve everybody,


644
0:28:28,0 --> 0:28:30,501
so that everybody's
protected from violence.


645
0:28:30,501 --> 0:28:33,0
And this is the history that
most of us have just forgotten.


646
0:28:33,0 --> 0:28:36,15
But what it reminds us is
that this is possible actually


647
0:28:36,15 --> 0:28:39,92
for those who are living in
the developing world as well.


648
0:28:39,92 --> 0:28:42,6
So that's the other way we begin
to turn to look for hope too,


649
0:28:42,6 --> 0:28:44,225
because there actually
are some stories


650
0:28:44,225 --> 0:28:46,73
and examples around
the world now


651
0:28:46,73 --> 0:28:48,6
where some best
practices are beginning


652
0:28:48,6 --> 0:28:51,97
to emerge of how the
international community can


653
0:28:51,97 --> 0:28:55,1
join with local
champions in the fight


654
0:28:55,1 --> 0:28:57,71
for trying to secure
justice for the poorest.


655
0:28:57,71 --> 0:28:59,59
One of the best
examples that we share


656
0:28:59,59 --> 0:29:1,5
in the book is the one
that Paul alluded to,


657
0:29:1,5 --> 0:29:4,8
which was this experiment we
did with the Gates Foundation


658
0:29:4,8 --> 0:29:7,3
in the second largest
city of the Philippines


659
0:29:7,3 --> 0:29:9,97
called Ceba which had a
terrible problem with child sex


660
0:29:9,97 --> 0:29:11,15
trafficking.


661
0:29:11,15 --> 0:29:13,39
And we were given
this grant to look at,


662
0:29:13,39 --> 0:29:15,68
well, let's see if
we can do two things.


663
0:29:15,68 --> 0:29:19,62
Number one can we stand up local
law enforcement, the police


664
0:29:19,62 --> 0:29:22,25
and the courts so they
actually effectively enforce


665
0:29:22,25 --> 0:29:24,24
the law against child
sex trafficking.


666
0:29:24,24 --> 0:29:25,26
Is that even possible?


667
0:29:25,26 --> 0:29:27,49
Because maybe it's so
hopelessly corrupt and brutal


668
0:29:27,49 --> 0:29:29,15
that's not even possible.


669
0:29:29,15 --> 0:29:31,56
And if that does happen,
will that actually


670
0:29:31,56 --> 0:29:34,0
reduce the amount of
violence against kids


671
0:29:34,0 --> 0:29:35,45
in the commercial sex trade?


672
0:29:35,45 --> 0:29:37,28
Or is this just
hopelessly some part


673
0:29:37,28 --> 0:29:39,53
of a massive problem of
poverty that will never


674
0:29:39,53 --> 0:29:41,79
be affected by good
law enforcement.


675
0:29:41,79 --> 0:29:44,53
Well, outside auditors
went in before the project


676
0:29:44,53 --> 0:29:46,31
began and sort of
drew a baseline


677
0:29:46,31 --> 0:29:48,28
of how much
victimization of children


678
0:29:48,28 --> 0:29:50,28
there was in the
commercial sex trade.


679
0:29:50,28 --> 0:29:53,0
And the goal of the project
over a four-year period of time


680
0:29:53,0 --> 0:29:56,36
was to try to demonstrate
a 20% reduction


681
0:29:56,36 --> 0:29:58,32
in the victimization
of these kids.


682
0:29:58,32 --> 0:30:1,37
That would have hit the ball
out of the park, home run.


683
0:30:1,37 --> 0:30:3,71
Gates Foundation would have
been super, super proud


684
0:30:3,71 --> 0:30:6,4
of this amazing winning project.


685
0:30:6,4 --> 0:30:9,76
But after four years of standing
up local law enforcement


686
0:30:9,76 --> 0:30:12,84
by deploying, as
IJM does everywhere


687
0:30:12,84 --> 0:30:18,45
in the world, local,
indigenous Filipino lawyers,


688
0:30:18,45 --> 0:30:20,74
criminal investigators
and social workers


689
0:30:20,74 --> 0:30:23,54
to actually turn law
enforcement around,


690
0:30:23,54 --> 0:30:26,84
what we saw after four short
years was their auditors


691
0:30:26,84 --> 0:30:31,52
found a 79% reduction in
the victimization of kids


692
0:30:31,52 --> 0:30:33,3
in the commercial sex trade.


693
0:30:33,3 --> 0:30:34,49
Why is that?


694
0:30:34,49 --> 0:30:36,97
Fundamentally, you
learn two things.


695
0:30:36,97 --> 0:30:41,21
Number one crimes against the
poor is crime of opportunity.


696
0:30:41,21 --> 0:30:43,151
You do it, because you
can get away with it.


697
0:30:43,151 --> 0:30:45,4
And it turns out that when
you can't get away with it,


698
0:30:45,4 --> 0:30:47,16
you don't do it anymore.


699
0:30:47,16 --> 0:30:49,38
It also turns out that
people who oppress the poor


700
0:30:49,38 --> 0:30:51,27
are not brave people.


701
0:30:51,27 --> 0:30:54,309
And when they start to feel
a sense of reasonable risk


702
0:30:54,309 --> 0:30:55,85
that they could pay
a price for that,


703
0:30:55,85 --> 0:30:57,884
they just leave them alone.


704
0:30:57,884 --> 0:30:59,8
There are a number of
stories in the book that


705
0:30:59,8 --> 0:31:4,64
begin to show, not only
from IJM but from other NGOs


706
0:31:4,64 --> 0:31:6,96
around the world, other
government organizations that


707
0:31:6,96 --> 0:31:11,62
are beginning to turn this
plague of violence around.


708
0:31:11,62 --> 0:31:14,75
Our invitation to you
is just really two-fold.


709
0:31:14,75 --> 0:31:18,254
One is to help us to change
the conversation about poverty.


710
0:31:18,254 --> 0:31:20,42
/ of you have probably been
engaged because you even


711
0:31:20,42 --> 0:31:21,96
came here this afternoon.


712
0:31:21,96 --> 0:31:24,682
You probably have some
heart for the struggle


713
0:31:24,682 --> 0:31:25,89
against poverty in our world.


714
0:31:25,89 --> 0:31:27,61
And we are at an
inflection point


715
0:31:27,61 --> 0:31:31,21
in history of making really
some tremendous improvements.


716
0:31:31,21 --> 0:31:33,96
But we're also
stalling out in terms


717
0:31:33,96 --> 0:31:37,32
of trying to help the
the 2 and 1/2 billion


718
0:31:37,32 --> 0:31:41,184
who are living off $2 a day, in
them actually breaking through.


719
0:31:41,184 --> 0:31:42,6
And so what we
would want to do is


720
0:31:42,6 --> 0:31:46,2
begin to make sure
that we don't fail


721
0:31:46,2 --> 0:31:48,96
to include the
problem of violence


722
0:31:48,96 --> 0:31:51,16
when we talk about poverty.


723
0:31:51,16 --> 0:31:53,7
So I would love it if you
got a hold of the book,


724
0:31:53,7 --> 0:31:57,1
read it, got yourself educated,
so you yourself are capable


725
0:31:57,1 --> 0:31:59,945
advocate of just almost
always asking the question.


726
0:31:59,945 --> 0:32:1,522
Yeah, but what
about the violence?


727
0:32:1,522 --> 0:32:3,23
And how are we dealing
with the violence?


728
0:32:3,23 --> 0:32:5,46
And how are we strengthening
local law enforcement


729
0:32:5,46 --> 0:32:7,34
to be able to address it?


730
0:32:7,34 --> 0:32:10,13
The second thing we
would love for you to do


731
0:32:10,13 --> 0:32:13,78
is not only get the book,
educate yourself, participate


732
0:32:13,78 --> 0:32:17,16
in the discussion,
but right now, there


733
0:32:17,16 --> 0:32:19,75
is a very, very important
conversation going on


734
0:32:19,75 --> 0:32:22,22
with the United Nations about
the Millennium Development


735
0:32:22,22 --> 0:32:22,927
Goals.


736
0:32:22,927 --> 0:32:24,26
You might have heard about this.


737
0:32:24,26 --> 0:32:27,26
In the year 2000,
the UN put together


738
0:32:27,26 --> 0:32:31,2
from the international community
a blueprint-- the blueprint--


739
0:32:31,2 --> 0:32:33,28
for trying to address
poverty and to try


740
0:32:33,28 --> 0:32:36,5
to make massive
progress over 15 years.


741
0:32:36,5 --> 0:32:39,21
So they came up with these
eight Millennium Goals.


742
0:32:39,21 --> 0:32:41,79
Well, in many
respects, those have


743
0:32:41,79 --> 0:32:43,97
been really helpful
and very powerful.


744
0:32:43,97 --> 0:32:46,83
But one of the grand
mistakes that was made


745
0:32:46,83 --> 0:32:50,47
was that they drew up a
blueprint to address poverty


746
0:32:50,47 --> 0:32:54,32
and didn't say a word about
violence, this horrific force


747
0:32:54,32 --> 0:32:56,46
that undercuts so
much of what's being


748
0:32:56,46 --> 0:32:58,61
done to try to assist the poor.


749
0:32:58,61 --> 0:33:0,7
An example of
that, for instance,


750
0:33:0,7 --> 0:33:2,87
is girls' education in the
developing world, which


751
0:33:2,87 --> 0:33:8,7
is this amazingly powerful way
to actually bring prosperity


752
0:33:8,7 --> 0:33:10,9
to a whole community, not
only for the individual girls


753
0:33:10,9 --> 0:33:12,7
but for that whole community.


754
0:33:12,7 --> 0:33:14,38
The problem is now
studies show that one


755
0:33:14,38 --> 0:33:15,89
of the primary
reasons girls don't


756
0:33:15,89 --> 0:33:19,2
go to school in the developing
world is because of violence.


757
0:33:19,2 --> 0:33:21,14
Violence on the way
to school, violence


758
0:33:21,14 --> 0:33:22,7
in school, violence
in the home that


759
0:33:22,7 --> 0:33:24,69
keeps them from going to school.


760
0:33:24,69 --> 0:33:27,78
And so we want to make
sure that as the UN now


761
0:33:27,78 --> 0:33:31,17
is rewriting the Millennium
Development Goals, so


762
0:33:31,17 --> 0:33:34,37
that in the year
2015, they'll launch


763
0:33:34,37 --> 0:33:36,94
this new blueprint for
addressing poverty,


764
0:33:36,94 --> 0:33:38,51
we just simply
want to make sure,


765
0:33:38,51 --> 0:33:40,42
let's not leave out violence.


766
0:33:40,42 --> 0:33:42,46
It's a bit like
the AIDS epidemic


767
0:33:42,46 --> 0:33:45,2
when it began to really
roll through the developing


768
0:33:45,2 --> 0:33:46,73
world in the '90s.


769
0:33:46,73 --> 0:33:50,1
And millions of people
were being decimated.


770
0:33:50,1 --> 0:33:56,145
Really you could not be serious
about addressing poverty


771
0:33:56,145 --> 0:33:57,974
in the developing
world if you are not


772
0:33:57,974 --> 0:33:59,64
willing to confront
the problem of AIDS,


773
0:33:59,64 --> 0:34:1,39
because whatever it
is that you are doing,


774
0:34:1,39 --> 0:34:3,49
AIDS is going to show
up and impact it.


775
0:34:3,49 --> 0:34:6,9
In the same way, we are hoping
to engage the conversation


776
0:34:6,9 --> 0:34:9,46
about poverty in the
developing world to say,


777
0:34:9,46 --> 0:34:11,67
unless you're dealing with
the problem of violence


778
0:34:11,67 --> 0:34:13,949
and the lawlessness
unleashed by the collapse


779
0:34:13,949 --> 0:34:15,699
of criminal justice
system, it's going


780
0:34:15,699 --> 0:34:18,989
to roll over almost everything
else you're trying to do.


781
0:34:18,989 --> 0:34:22,449
And so we would love
it if you would go


782
0:34:22,449 --> 0:34:26,199
to the
locusteffect.com/petition,


783
0:34:26,199 --> 0:34:28,1
and just joined
a petition there.


784
0:34:28,1 --> 0:34:31,5
That goes to the Secretary
General of the UN.


785
0:34:31,5 --> 0:34:34,2
It ought to just be
millions of common people


786
0:34:34,2 --> 0:34:36,662
who say, as they did with regard
to the AIDS epidemic, hey,


787
0:34:36,662 --> 0:34:38,12
I'm not an expert
about everything,


788
0:34:38,12 --> 0:34:39,415
but I care about this stuff.


789
0:34:39,415 --> 0:34:41,79
And it seems to make sense to
me that if we don't address


790
0:34:41,79 --> 0:34:44,4
violence, we're not going
to make the progress that we


791
0:34:44,4 --> 0:34:45,36
want in addressing poverty.


792
0:34:45,36 --> 0:34:46,38
Simple as that.


793
0:34:46,38 --> 0:34:50,8
But what I can tell you is
that this stuff matters.


794
0:34:50,8 --> 0:34:52,34
And it's a tremendous
way for you


795
0:34:52,34 --> 0:34:54,21
not only to engage
yourself, but begin


796
0:34:54,21 --> 0:34:57,45
to mobilize all of your
networks into the fight.


797
0:34:57,45 --> 0:35:0,88
So that's all I have to
share this afternoon.


798
0:35:0,88 --> 0:35:3,47
I'd be happy to take
questions or interaction.


799
0:35:3,47 --> 0:35:7,29
AUDIENCE: In your first example,
the local police station


800
0:35:7,29 --> 0:35:9,3
had lost funding.


801
0:35:9,3 --> 0:35:12,33
So my question to you would
be in these developing world,


802
0:35:12,33 --> 0:35:14,73
where the governments
themselves often


803
0:35:14,73 --> 0:35:18,239
lack funding, if you
have any ideas for


804
0:35:18,239 --> 0:35:19,28
had to attack that angle.


805
0:35:19,28 --> 0:35:20,105
GARY HAUGEN: Yeah.


806
0:35:20,105 --> 0:35:23,56
In many respects, we'll
look in the developing world


807
0:35:23,56 --> 0:35:26,292
and we'll see, especially
in low income countries,


808
0:35:26,292 --> 0:35:28,91
you think, wow, they really
don't have enough resources


809
0:35:28,91 --> 0:35:30,326
in the country to
actually provide


810
0:35:30,326 --> 0:35:31,47
for decent law enforcement.


811
0:35:31,47 --> 0:35:33,15
Except when you look
at all the dollars


812
0:35:33,15 --> 0:35:35,68
that are being spent
on private security.


813
0:35:35,68 --> 0:35:37,75
And then you realize,
oh, in the aggregate,


814
0:35:37,75 --> 0:35:39,73
this economy actually
has plenty of money


815
0:35:39,73 --> 0:35:44,1
to be able to provide for public
security, public law and order.


816
0:35:44,1 --> 0:35:48,38
And so what it takes
is a groundswell


817
0:35:48,38 --> 0:35:55,6
of social demand within
these communities--


818
0:35:55,6 --> 0:35:58,3
a groundswell of demand
to actually reallocate


819
0:35:58,3 --> 0:36:3,46
resources to the priority of
providing for law enforcement.


820
0:36:3,46 --> 0:36:5,45
That's why I want to
emphasize this is not


821
0:36:5,45 --> 0:36:9,58
a problem is going to be solved
from outsiders paratrooping


822
0:36:9,58 --> 0:36:12,25
in and setting up
American justice systems


823
0:36:12,25 --> 0:36:13,22
or something like that.


824
0:36:13,22 --> 0:36:17,16
This is a fight that the
community itself, the nation,


825
0:36:17,16 --> 0:36:19,3
must own.


826
0:36:19,3 --> 0:36:23,21
And part of that is to
rally the community,


827
0:36:23,21 --> 0:36:27,28
to begin to demand that the
public justice system is well


828
0:36:27,28 --> 0:36:28,542
provided for.


829
0:36:28,542 --> 0:36:30,75
So that's one of the things
the International Justice


830
0:36:30,75 --> 0:36:31,67
Mission does.


831
0:36:31,67 --> 0:36:34,54
And a number of
the other examples


832
0:36:34,54 --> 0:36:36,19
that we given in the
book is how do we


833
0:36:36,19 --> 0:36:39,93
come alongside local
champions in those communities


834
0:36:39,93 --> 0:36:42,78
and help resource them to
be able to draw attention


835
0:36:42,78 --> 0:36:48,21
to the problem, but
also realign resources


836
0:36:48,21 --> 0:36:50,4
so they're providing
for a public justice


837
0:36:50,4 --> 0:36:53,37
system that cares for all.


838
0:36:53,37 --> 0:36:57,32
One of the amazing, of
course, examples of this


839
0:36:57,32 --> 0:37:1,74
is the country of Georgia, which
is a former Soviet republic,


840
0:37:1,74 --> 0:37:7,24
which in 2003 was ranked
something like 145 out of 190


841
0:37:7,24 --> 0:37:9,32
countries as most corrupt.


842
0:37:9,32 --> 0:37:11,66
It was ranked as more corrupt
than any country that we


843
0:37:11,66 --> 0:37:14,37
work in, especially the police.


844
0:37:14,37 --> 0:37:17,83
But there was a demand
amongst the citizenry


845
0:37:17,83 --> 0:37:20,54
and a new election that
brought to bear leaders


846
0:37:20,54 --> 0:37:23,24
into power who began
to attack corruption.


847
0:37:23,24 --> 0:37:25,13
And they started with
police corruption.


848
0:37:25,13 --> 0:37:27,79
And the thing that
they found was


849
0:37:27,79 --> 0:37:32,22
that police officers in Georgia
would pay a $10,000 bribe


850
0:37:32,22 --> 0:37:34,28
in order to get a job,
for which they were


851
0:37:34,28 --> 0:37:37,78
paid by the government
$10 a month.


852
0:37:37,78 --> 0:37:39,326
Why would you do that?


853
0:37:39,326 --> 0:37:41,2
Because basically you've
been given a license


854
0:37:41,2 --> 0:37:43,45
to then extort
money from people.


855
0:37:43,45 --> 0:37:46,304
And then those high authorities
in the Georgian government


856
0:37:46,304 --> 0:37:47,22
also figured that out.


857
0:37:47,22 --> 0:37:48,77
Let me see, I get $10,000 bribe.


858
0:37:48,77 --> 0:37:50,76
We need a lot of police.


859
0:37:50,76 --> 0:37:53,93
Because the more police we have,
the more bribe money I get.


860
0:37:53,93 --> 0:37:56,59
And so they have this
bloated police force


861
0:37:56,59 --> 0:37:59,52
that was ill trained and
ill equipped and completely


862
0:37:59,52 --> 0:38:0,66
abusive.


863
0:38:0,66 --> 0:38:3,93
So when this new leadership came
in, the first thing they did


864
0:38:3,93 --> 0:38:7,63
is they fired 16,000 police
officers in a single day, sent


865
0:38:7,63 --> 0:38:12,3
them home and the
city was safer.


866
0:38:12,3 --> 0:38:14,39
Then they rebuilt the
police from the ground up.


867
0:38:14,39 --> 0:38:18,83
And they were able to
pay them good wages,


868
0:38:18,83 --> 0:38:20,46
provide them with
good equipment,


869
0:38:20,46 --> 0:38:22,21
and provide them with
good management that


870
0:38:22,21 --> 0:38:25,49
was able to secure integrity
to the police force.


871
0:38:25,49 --> 0:38:31,35
And the transformation for the
common person is tremendous.


872
0:38:31,35 --> 0:38:32,88
So the resources are there.


873
0:38:32,88 --> 0:38:34,82
It's just how you allocate them.


874
0:38:34,82 --> 0:38:35,41
Yeah.


875
0:38:35,41 --> 0:38:38,13
AUDIENCE: There's a sort of
a stereotype about violence


876
0:38:38,13 --> 0:38:40,627
against the poor,
which is maybe part


877
0:38:40,627 --> 0:38:42,96
of the self-defense mechanism,
like you're saying, well,


878
0:38:42,96 --> 0:38:44,56
after this, we'll feel
like going and taking a nap


879
0:38:44,56 --> 0:38:46,69
and forgetting about the
whole thing, which is, oh,


880
0:38:46,69 --> 0:38:48,691
those poor people over
in the poor part of town.


881
0:38:48,691 --> 0:38:50,648
They have all this violence
in their community.


882
0:38:50,648 --> 0:38:52,8
They're all beating
each other up.


883
0:38:52,8 --> 0:38:54,205
But as long as they don't
come into my neighborhood


884
0:38:54,205 --> 0:38:57,84
and break into my house, I just
don't have to think about it.


885
0:38:57,84 --> 0:38:59,4
I'm wondering
especially, it seems


886
0:38:59,4 --> 0:39:1,65
like this might differ across
the different categories


887
0:39:1,65 --> 0:39:3,108
of violence you
were talking about,


888
0:39:3,108 --> 0:39:7,7
but to what extent are
we looking at lawlessness


889
0:39:7,7 --> 0:39:9,69
within the poor community, and
to what extent are we really


890
0:39:9,69 --> 0:39:12,55
looking at the people who
are much better off going


891
0:39:12,55 --> 0:39:15,83
in systematically taking the
land, as you were saying,


892
0:39:15,83 --> 0:39:17,98
from the poor and
enslaving the poor and so


893
0:39:17,98 --> 0:39:20,52
forth, as opposed to domestic
violence, which might be more


894
0:39:20,52 --> 0:39:22,22
of a poor-on-poor
or kind of thing.


895
0:39:22,22 --> 0:39:23,22
GARY HAUGEN: Yeah.


896
0:39:23,22 --> 0:39:25,64
It's both.


897
0:39:25,64 --> 0:39:33,431
Poor-on-poor violence is sort of
 relatively-poor-against-the-poorest


898
0:39:33,431 --> 0:39:33,93
violence.


899
0:39:33,93 --> 0:39:34,429
Right?


900
0:39:34,429 --> 0:39:36,16
So the opening
story, for instance,


901
0:39:36,16 --> 0:39:44,22
of the rape and murder of the
child in Bolivia in this town,


902
0:39:44,22 --> 0:39:47,38
that was committed
by the wealthy family


903
0:39:47,38 --> 0:39:54,46
inside the town, who are not
wealthy from our perspective.


904
0:39:54,46 --> 0:39:56,95
But in that town, they are
the wealthy or powerful ones.


905
0:39:56,95 --> 0:40:0,31
So it is sort of the strong
preying upon the weak.


906
0:40:0,31 --> 0:40:3,47
But it is also true that,
for instance, the people who


907
0:40:3,47 --> 0:40:8,73
run slave operations in rice
factories, brick factories,


908
0:40:8,73 --> 0:40:11,83
these are people of
substantial economic power


909
0:40:11,83 --> 0:40:14,12
and substantial political power.


910
0:40:14,12 --> 0:40:16,2
So those kinds of
crimes and especially


911
0:40:16,2 --> 0:40:18,955
the land theft,
those are also crimes


912
0:40:18,955 --> 0:40:21,48
that have substantial
economic power behind them,


913
0:40:21,48 --> 0:40:24,9
so you are dealing with people
who are actually making money


914
0:40:24,9 --> 0:40:25,18
off the violence.


915
0:40:25,18 --> 0:40:28,31
There's not a lot of people
making money off malaria.


916
0:40:28,31 --> 0:40:30,79
There's not a lot of
people making money off


917
0:40:30,79 --> 0:40:35,43
of contaminating water or
making hospitals run badly.


918
0:40:35,43 --> 0:40:37,16
You could make up an
instance, I guess,


919
0:40:37,16 --> 0:40:38,3
in which that's the case.


920
0:40:38,3 --> 0:40:39,821
But for the most part,
that's not the case.


921
0:40:39,821 --> 0:40:43,8
But there is a massive
business of economic advantage


922
0:40:43,8 --> 0:40:45,12
from violence against
other human beings.


923
0:40:45,12 --> 0:40:46,87
And if you don't have
a good system that's


924
0:40:46,87 --> 0:40:48,82
prepared to fight
that, that's going


925
0:40:48,82 --> 0:40:52,3
to roll all over
the most vulnerable.


926
0:40:52,3 --> 0:40:53,95
AUDIENCE: Two kind
of related questions.


927
0:40:53,95 --> 0:40:56,7
Or it might just be that
I'm trying to jam two in.


928
0:40:56,7 --> 0:41:1,7
One, you made a good case for
how violence affects the poor.


929
0:41:1,7 --> 0:41:4,65
I'm curious about flipping
that around and thinking


930
0:41:4,65 --> 0:41:7,63
about how does poverty
actually create violence.


931
0:41:7,63 --> 0:41:11,88
How much of this is from
people being poor and having


932
0:41:11,88 --> 0:41:12,86
no other opportunities?


933
0:41:12,86 --> 0:41:15,38
How much does that impact
the police situation


934
0:41:15,38 --> 0:41:19,47
where you talk about police
who are very underpaid?


935
0:41:19,47 --> 0:41:21,454
And getting this
into the equation,


936
0:41:21,454 --> 0:41:22,87
the second part
of the question is


937
0:41:22,87 --> 0:41:25,92
where is the most
leverage to this.


938
0:41:25,92 --> 0:41:28,14
There were some big
numbers thrown out


939
0:41:28,14 --> 0:41:31,52
around 4 billion people without
law enforcement protection,


940
0:41:31,52 --> 0:41:33,526
30 million in
slavery, where do we


941
0:41:33,526 --> 0:41:34,9
get the most
leverage to actually


942
0:41:34,9 --> 0:41:38,274
have the most impact
on a problem like this?


943
0:41:38,274 --> 0:41:39,69
GARY HAUGEN: From
our perspective,


944
0:41:39,69 --> 0:41:42,65
there's no question that
the biggest leverage comes


945
0:41:42,65 --> 0:41:45,94
from a credible criminal
deterrent in the community.


946
0:41:45,94 --> 0:41:52,2
Because crime proceeds
along elasticity to risk.


947
0:41:52,2 --> 0:41:55,94
And different kinds of
crime is sensitive to risk


948
0:41:55,94 --> 0:41:56,84
in different ways.


949
0:41:56,84 --> 0:41:59,89
So if you have social
pathology, sort of deviancy,


950
0:41:59,89 --> 0:42:3,33
that the pedophilia's sort
of a crime, where somebody,


951
0:42:3,33 --> 0:42:5,942
just out of deviancy, is
going to commit that crime.


952
0:42:5,942 --> 0:42:7,9
And actually, it's not
very responsive to risk.


953
0:42:7,9 --> 0:42:10,625
You can ratchet up the
law enforcement on that,


954
0:42:10,625 --> 0:42:12,5
and those people commit
those crimes anyways.


955
0:42:12,5 --> 0:42:14,64
And they end up going to jail.


956
0:42:14,64 --> 0:42:17,16
So it's not very
responsive to risk.


957
0:42:17,16 --> 0:42:20,972
Also true with
crime of necessity,


958
0:42:20,972 --> 0:42:23,18
where some one feels like,
I gotta commit this crime.


959
0:42:23,18 --> 0:42:25,402
And., that's what a
lot of state crime


960
0:42:25,402 --> 0:42:26,86
is that's committed
by governments.


961
0:42:26,86 --> 0:42:28,776
They think I have to
torture this guy in order


962
0:42:28,776 --> 0:42:29,57
to stay in power.


963
0:42:29,57 --> 0:42:31,68
So this is a crime
of necessarity.


964
0:42:31,68 --> 0:42:35,97
So that responsiveness to
risk is also not that great.


965
0:42:35,97 --> 0:42:38,55
I also crime of
desperation where


966
0:42:38,55 --> 0:42:41,51
you feel like I got
a steal the bread,


967
0:42:41,51 --> 0:42:44,2
I have to hijack the car
because my family's starving,


968
0:42:44,2 --> 0:42:45,86
and so this is necessity.


969
0:42:45,86 --> 0:42:49,0
That's also not very
responsive to risk.


970
0:42:49,0 --> 0:42:51,31
But the vast,
vast, vast majority


971
0:42:51,31 --> 0:42:54,78
of crime against the poor
is crime of opportunity.


972
0:42:54,78 --> 0:42:57,55
You do it because you
can get away with it.


973
0:42:57,55 --> 0:42:59,28
And what you find
there on the curve


974
0:42:59,28 --> 0:43:1,91
is that as soon as there
is a little increase


975
0:43:1,91 --> 0:43:4,76
in the risk, that falls
very, very sharply,


976
0:43:4,76 --> 0:43:9,1
especially things like any
kind of crime of opportunity


977
0:43:9,1 --> 0:43:10,95
that produces an
economic reward.


978
0:43:10,95 --> 0:43:12,39
That's certainly like slavery.


979
0:43:12,39 --> 0:43:16,254
That step drops off like 79%
in a four-year period of time


980
0:43:16,254 --> 0:43:17,67
when people who
were doing it just


981
0:43:17,67 --> 0:43:21,64
for the purposes of making money
find that the risk calculation


982
0:43:21,64 --> 0:43:26,1
has changed so we have seen
the greatest returns from just


983
0:43:26,1 --> 0:43:28,867
making sure that those
who would be drawn


984
0:43:28,867 --> 0:43:30,95
to that crime against the
poor feel like they have


985
0:43:30,95 --> 0:43:32,98
a reasonable chance
of going to jail.


986
0:43:32,98 --> 0:43:36,84
That means you get rid
of all the soft crime.


987
0:43:36,84 --> 0:43:39,12
That will leave you
with a hard crime, which


988
0:43:39,12 --> 0:43:41,73
is the crime of desperation,
the crime of necessity,


989
0:43:41,73 --> 0:43:43,38
the crime of social deviancy.


990
0:43:43,38 --> 0:43:45,84
And in the West,
that's what we're


991
0:43:45,84 --> 0:43:48,84
trying to mostly battle
in our communities.


992
0:43:48,84 --> 0:43:52,467
But we have a really
different struggle


993
0:43:52,467 --> 0:43:54,5
in the developing
world, where there's


994
0:43:54,5 --> 0:43:56,81
a tremendous amount of soft
crime, crime of opportunity


995
0:43:56,81 --> 0:43:58,29
that hasn't been
addressed at all.


996
0:43:58,29 --> 0:44:0,54
And we will have to eventually
get to the other stuff.


997
0:44:0,54 --> 0:44:3,9
But right now, the
massive numbers


998
0:44:3,9 --> 0:44:6,1
are coming from just
pure opportunity.


999
0:44:6,1 --> 0:44:6,51
Yeah.


1000
0:44:6,51 --> 0:44:12,14
The second question was
about-- the prior question--


1001
0:44:12,14 --> 0:44:14,35
AUDIENCE: The first was, I
think, what you mentioned,


1002
0:44:14,35 --> 0:44:17,3
which is the crimes of
necessity or desperation,


1003
0:44:17,3 --> 0:44:19,24
that how much does
poverty itself create


1004
0:44:19,24 --> 0:44:22,895
the violence versus violence
exacerbating the poverty?


1005
0:44:22,895 --> 0:44:23,77
GARY HAUGEN: A cycle.


1006
0:44:23,77 --> 0:44:24,645
They're interrelated.


1007
0:44:24,645 --> 0:44:27,31



1008
0:44:27,31 --> 0:44:29,9
But it's a mistake
to imagine that you


1009
0:44:29,9 --> 0:44:33,35
have to wait to solve poverty
before you can drastically


1010
0:44:33,35 --> 0:44:36,5
reduce the amount of
violence against the poor.


1011
0:44:36,5 --> 0:44:40,13
You can addressed
violence because it's


1012
0:44:40,13 --> 0:44:43,84
driven by the incentives of
the perpetrator, substantially.


1013
0:44:43,84 --> 0:44:47,59
And so those risk calculations
are very, very powerful.


1014
0:44:47,59 --> 0:44:50,5
You will need to address
the other sort of caught


1015
0:44:50,5 --> 0:44:53,94
complicated social
causes for crime.


1016
0:44:53,94 --> 0:44:56,18
But a massive
amount of it can be


1017
0:44:56,18 --> 0:44:59,6
addressed by addressing the
incentives of the perpetrators


1018
0:44:59,6 --> 0:45:1,56
unlike dirty water
or disease they


1019
0:45:1,56 --> 0:45:3,97
don't have human will behind it.


1020
0:45:3,97 --> 0:45:5,59
All crime does.


1021
0:45:5,59 --> 0:45:9,42
And so you affect the
incentives of the perpetrators


1022
0:45:9,42 --> 0:45:11,842
quite powerful and faster than
you might otherwise think.


1023
0:45:11,842 --> 0:45:14,5
AUDIENCE: I realize you're
focusing on the developing


1024
0:45:14,5 --> 0:45:15,24
world.


1025
0:45:15,24 --> 0:45:18,35
And you just
mentioned that, say,


1026
0:45:18,35 --> 0:45:20,23
in a society like ours
in the United States,


1027
0:45:20,23 --> 0:45:25,64
we deal with maybe, you say
less of this soft crime.


1028
0:45:25,64 --> 0:45:26,714
More the hard crime.


1029
0:45:26,714 --> 0:45:29,13
I feel like we have the same
thing happening in the United


1030
0:45:29,13 --> 0:45:31,515
States where money
pays for protection.


1031
0:45:31,515 --> 0:45:33,36
For instance, our
property taxes pay


1032
0:45:33,36 --> 0:45:38,43
for a safe neighborhood
and the poor neighborhoods


1033
0:45:38,43 --> 0:45:40,34
may not get lights.


1034
0:45:40,34 --> 0:45:43,4
Whoever's causing the
crime, whether it's


1035
0:45:43,4 --> 0:45:45,42
for economic opportunity by
the more, more powerful or out


1036
0:45:45,42 --> 0:45:47,61
of desperation,
the same people are


1037
0:45:47,61 --> 0:45:49,78
suffering with the people
in those communities.


1038
0:45:49,78 --> 0:45:53,98
Or why do people feel they don't
trust law enforcement states?


1039
0:45:53,98 --> 0:45:56,49
Or you could pay for a good
representation in court.


1040
0:45:56,49 --> 0:45:58,1
Or you can get a
state appointed one


1041
0:45:58,1 --> 0:46:0,64
that only gives your
case five seconds.


1042
0:46:0,64 --> 0:46:3,32
So I don't see that
those problems don't


1043
0:46:3,32 --> 0:46:8,28
exist in the quote
"nondeveloping world."


1044
0:46:8,28 --> 0:46:9,83
Have you given or
are there others


1045
0:46:9,83 --> 0:46:13,51
doing similar lines of research?


1046
0:46:13,51 --> 0:46:16,45
GARY HAUGEN: Yeah,
and that is the case


1047
0:46:16,45 --> 0:46:19,61
and as I said the
first half of my career


1048
0:46:19,61 --> 0:46:21,507
was addressing those
failures actually


1049
0:46:21,507 --> 0:46:22,59
here in the United States.


1050
0:46:22,59 --> 0:46:24,923
So there's no abuse taking
place overseas that I haven't


1051
0:46:24,923 --> 0:46:27,66
seen somewhere here
in the United States.


1052
0:46:27,66 --> 0:46:30,53
What we do have is just
massively greater resources


1053
0:46:30,53 --> 0:46:31,845
to address them.


1054
0:46:31,845 --> 0:46:33,97
But it's also true that
those with wealth and money


1055
0:46:33,97 --> 0:46:36,22
supplement the provision
of public service


1056
0:46:36,22 --> 0:46:39,54
with private security and with
private legal representation


1057
0:46:39,54 --> 0:46:40,56
and so forth.


1058
0:46:40,56 --> 0:46:42,16
And so it is certainly
true that you


1059
0:46:42,16 --> 0:46:44,83
get better security
the wealthier


1060
0:46:44,83 --> 0:46:47,1
you are in the United
States and in any country.


1061
0:46:47,1 --> 0:46:49,58
That's true, but the
question is whether or not


1062
0:46:49,58 --> 0:46:51,49
you're going to have any sort
of even reasonable baseline


1063
0:46:51,49 --> 0:46:53,17
of protection for those reports.


1064
0:46:53,17 --> 0:47:0,79
You might look at Katherine
Boo's recent book on, I think,


1065
0:47:0,79 --> 0:47:3,69
"Behind the Beautiful Forevers,"
where she lived for three years


1066
0:47:3,69 --> 0:47:5,13
in a slum in India.


1067
0:47:5,13 --> 0:47:6,9
And she's this
amazing journalist


1068
0:47:6,9 --> 0:47:8,51
who's actually written a lot
about the failures of law


1069
0:47:8,51 --> 0:47:10,51
enforcement in the
United States too.


1070
0:47:10,51 --> 0:47:13,76
But she wrote about just
the realities of poverty


1071
0:47:13,76 --> 0:47:16,1
in the slum, and one of the
things, when she came home


1072
0:47:16,1 --> 0:47:19,73
and she was on NPR, talking--
She says well, one thing I can


1073
0:47:19,73 --> 0:47:22,38
say is different about coming
home to the United States


1074
0:47:22,38 --> 0:47:26,91
is that the basic level of
opportunity for law enforcement


1075
0:47:26,91 --> 0:47:29,39
to provide basic
order in the community


1076
0:47:29,39 --> 0:47:36,2
is order of magnitude different.


1077
0:47:36,2 --> 0:47:40,0
It's also true for instance
that the poor-- and we have


1078
0:47:40,0 --> 0:47:42,77
mass incarceration of the
poor in the United States,


1079
0:47:42,77 --> 0:47:46,0
because of poor legal
services in many respects--


1080
0:47:46,0 --> 0:47:48,75
but what's true
in the developing


1081
0:47:48,75 --> 0:47:52,42
world is that if you're too
poor to have an attorney,


1082
0:47:52,42 --> 0:47:54,57
you get no attorney.


1083
0:47:54,57 --> 0:47:57,68
So you don't get a sleepy
attorney or a drunk attorney,


1084
0:47:57,68 --> 0:48:1,892
or you get none at all, and
it's ap overwhelmingly likely


1085
0:48:1,892 --> 0:48:4,1
that if you're a poor person
in the developing world,


1086
0:48:4,1 --> 0:48:7,73
you will appear in court in a
proceeding that is conducted


1087
0:48:7,73 --> 0:48:9,67
in a language you
do not understand.


1088
0:48:9,67 --> 0:48:12,6
So you will appear,
because actually conducted


1089
0:48:12,6 --> 0:48:14,18
in the colonial
language, whether that's


1090
0:48:14,18 --> 0:48:17,21
English or Spanish or French.


1091
0:48:17,21 --> 0:48:18,96
Because the legal
institutions were set up


1092
0:48:18,96 --> 0:48:21,71
by the colonial powers, and they
have never been re-engineered.


1093
0:48:21,71 --> 0:48:23,84
This is the other amazing thing.


1094
0:48:23,84 --> 0:48:25,83
The laws have changed?


1095
0:48:25,83 --> 0:48:27,82
Post-colonial
wonderful embedding


1096
0:48:27,82 --> 0:48:32,37
of human rights standards
in domestic law.


1097
0:48:32,37 --> 0:48:34,91
But the pipeline that
actually delivers those rights


1098
0:48:34,91 --> 0:48:38,81
is law enforcement, which has
been set up by a colonial model


1099
0:48:38,81 --> 0:48:40,36
and never changed.


1100
0:48:40,36 --> 0:48:44,65
And so one of the
things that manifests


1101
0:48:44,65 --> 0:48:48,4
is that you don't have
any representation at all.


1102
0:48:48,4 --> 0:48:50,4
And you do it in a
proceeding that's


1103
0:48:50,4 --> 0:48:53,43
conducted in a language
you don't understand.


1104
0:48:53,43 --> 0:48:56,45
So imagine, you're
accused of a crime.


1105
0:48:56,45 --> 0:48:58,44
You are thrown into a
proceeding in which you


1106
0:48:58,44 --> 0:49:0,14
have no legal protection.


1107
0:49:0,14 --> 0:49:2,62
And you can't understand a word.


1108
0:49:2,62 --> 0:49:4,92
And then you just get
shuffled off to jail.


1109
0:49:4,92 --> 0:49:6,64
And you're sort of
asking, as I see


1110
0:49:6,64 --> 0:49:9,44
this many times, the
defendant who's poor,


1111
0:49:9,44 --> 0:49:12,36
asking the guard, of course,
who has no education,


1112
0:49:12,36 --> 0:49:14,86
is illiterate generally,
but to ask the guard,


1113
0:49:14,86 --> 0:49:17,77
can you just please
explain what just happened?


1114
0:49:17,77 --> 0:49:21,349
So ever society needs
to carry vigilance


1115
0:49:21,349 --> 0:49:23,64
on behalf of those who are
poorest and most vulnerable,


1116
0:49:23,64 --> 0:49:27,3
who are going to get run over
by a criminal justice system,


1117
0:49:27,3 --> 0:49:30,81
But the utter collapse of these
systems in the developing world


1118
0:49:30,81 --> 0:49:34,12
is something, as we
wrote in another article,


1119
0:49:34,12 --> 0:49:35,62
you almost have
to see to believe.


1120
0:49:35,62 --> 0:49:38,369
And we're hoping to just
bring that to the surface.


1121
0:49:38,369 --> 0:49:38,91
AUDIENCE: Hi.


1122
0:49:38,91 --> 0:49:42,4
I was just curious if you
had any thoughts on any ways


1123
0:49:42,4 --> 0:49:46,63
that information technology has
impacted this problem at all.


1124
0:49:46,63 --> 0:49:48,179
Have you seen this
through your work?


1125
0:49:48,179 --> 0:49:49,845
Are there things that
we could be doing?


1126
0:49:49,845 --> 0:49:53,777
You know, a big place like
Google-- that could help.


1127
0:49:53,777 --> 0:49:54,86
GARY HAUGEN: Massively so.


1128
0:49:54,86 --> 0:49:58,36
And in fact, we have
had some opportunities


1129
0:49:58,36 --> 0:50:1,27
to bring out our director
of investigations,


1130
0:50:1,27 --> 0:50:4,36
for example, who was
formerly the director of NCIS


1131
0:50:4,36 --> 0:50:7,13
to talk about the amazing ways
that actually technology can be


1132
0:50:7,13 --> 0:50:9,99
leveraged in on
behalf of the poor


1133
0:50:9,99 --> 0:50:11,72
to fight much of this crime.


1134
0:50:11,72 --> 0:50:13,96
In many ways in the
developing world,


1135
0:50:13,96 --> 0:50:16,64
these technological
advances are leapfrogging


1136
0:50:16,64 --> 0:50:19,6
in ways that are able to
empower the poor tremendously.


1137
0:50:19,6 --> 0:50:23,1
When I started doing this
work, there-- I know,


1138
0:50:23,1 --> 0:50:25,28
it's dating me a bit, but
there were no cell phones


1139
0:50:25,28 --> 0:50:26,4
in the developing world.


1140
0:50:26,4 --> 0:50:30,79
And now we give cell phones to
slaves inside brick factories.


1141
0:50:30,79 --> 0:50:33,23
And they are able to
communicate with us.


1142
0:50:33,23 --> 0:50:37,41
And then there's
using imagery to find


1143
0:50:37,41 --> 0:50:42,53
places that are more likely
to be using slave labor,


1144
0:50:42,53 --> 0:50:44,96
the way of creating
sort of hot spots


1145
0:50:44,96 --> 0:50:48,3
where abuse is
taking through data.


1146
0:50:48,3 --> 0:50:50,23
The truth is though
every word I just


1147
0:50:50,23 --> 0:50:52,74
used I was acting like I knew
what I was talking about.


1148
0:50:52,74 --> 0:50:53,96
[LAUGHTER]


1149
0:50:53,96 --> 0:50:56,25
GARY HAUGEN: You guys are
more likely to be the ones


1150
0:50:56,25 --> 0:50:58,74
to actually get
to know the needs,


1151
0:50:58,74 --> 0:51:1,79
and then to begin to dream and
imagine what technology can do.


1152
0:51:1,79 --> 0:51:4,9
So that would be another
wonderful thing for you guys


1153
0:51:4,9 --> 0:51:6,98
to read the book, acquaint
yourself with the problems,


1154
0:51:6,98 --> 0:51:9,66
and then begin to imagine with
us the way in which technology


1155
0:51:9,66 --> 0:51:10,8
can be leveraged.


1156
0:51:10,8 --> 0:51:13,34
Because one of just absolute
things that technology


1157
0:51:13,34 --> 0:51:17,45
is able to do is to bring
transparency to what's


1158
0:51:17,45 --> 0:51:20,81
happening by empowering people
to signal what is happening


1159
0:51:20,81 --> 0:51:23,445
or communicate what's happening
and to shrink the world


1160
0:51:23,445 --> 0:51:25,41
and to do it to do it real time.


1161
0:51:25,41 --> 0:51:27,51
I think technology is
fundamentally just going


1162
0:51:27,51 --> 0:51:29,135
to make it harder
and harder and harder


1163
0:51:29,135 --> 0:51:30,69
to get away with these things.


1164
0:51:30,69 --> 0:51:33,21
And that is what the victims
of abuse and violence


1165
0:51:33,21 --> 0:51:36,87
need most is for other
people to know about it.


1166
0:51:36,87 --> 0:51:39,39
Because if you think about it,
what does a violent criminal


1167
0:51:39,39 --> 0:51:39,89
always do?


1168
0:51:39,89 --> 0:51:42,51
And its part of the thing
that makes them so scary


1169
0:51:42,51 --> 0:51:45,45
is they hide what
they do in the dark.


1170
0:51:45,45 --> 0:51:48,75
And they try to intimidate
other people from seeing it.


1171
0:51:48,75 --> 0:51:50,5
Why do they do that?


1172
0:51:50,5 --> 0:51:52,84
They do it because
they're afraid.


1173
0:51:52,84 --> 0:51:54,66
Criminals are
fundamentally afraid,


1174
0:51:54,66 --> 0:51:56,859
that if other people
know what's going on,


1175
0:51:56,859 --> 0:51:58,9
they won't be able to
withstand the power that we


1176
0:51:58,9 --> 0:52:0,191
brought to bear upon the theme.


1177
0:52:0,191 --> 0:52:4,16
So that way the technology can
bring us much more to actually


1178
0:52:4,16 --> 0:52:6,79
be transparent about what's
going on in the world


1179
0:52:6,79 --> 0:52:9,227
and empower even the weakest
to be able to do that.


1180
0:52:9,227 --> 0:52:11,81
I think we're going to be living
in a very different and safer


1181
0:52:11,81 --> 0:52:12,605
world for the poor.


1182
0:52:12,605 --> 0:52:14,48
PAUL LEE: Just join me
in giving Gary a hand.


1183
0:52:14,48 --> 0:52:17,53
Thanks for coming
over, appreciate it.


1184
0:52:17,53 --> 0:54:17,53
