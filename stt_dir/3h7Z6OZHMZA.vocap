###27 HARVII: When people want to think of hobbies, you think of
###29 singing and acting.
###30 You don't think of celebrity.
###32 
###35 Or how much you try, or how much you wait, and then when
###38 you meet them you find it so worth it.
###40 And you're just such in a good mood after that.
###42 It's like a really good feeling.
###43 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###51 HARVII: I think nearly everyone there is would want
###52 to be friends with at least one celebrity just because of
###55 how famous they are and just knowing them.
###59 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###75 BILLIE JD PORTER: This is Harvii.
###76 He became an overnight internet sensation after this
###79 image where he's trying to give actress Megan Fox a rose
###82 went viral.
###84 The story blew up so much that he was even flown to America
###87 to appear on various TV shows.
###90 In this film, I follow Harvii and a few other people we meet
###93 along the way as they push their celebrity obsessions to
###96 the extreme.
###96 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###103 BILLIE JD PORTER: So what was it like, the
###105 whole Megan Fox thing?
###106 HARVII: I loved it.
###107 You had, like, paparazzis at the airports and everything.
###110 It was fun.
###111 It was, like, my little sport [INAUDIBLE]
###113 and my little five minutes of fame.
###115 I loved it.
###117 Loved it.
###119 We got saved for, like, another few days because
###121 that's when, like, loads of people were asking for
###123 interviews.
###124 And we did them.
###124 Then we got sent back.
###125 And then I did a few things in England.
###128 And then it all died down because of Michael Jackson.
###130 And then, like, now it's, like, nothing's happening.
###135 BILLIE JD PORTER: During this interview, Megan gave a warm
###137 and heartfelt apology.
###138 MEGAN FOX (OFFSCREEN): I'm sorry, sweet boy.
###139 I would ever do that to you.
###141 I would gladly accept your rose if I see you again.
###144 The paparazzi will not let you to me and I'm sorry.
###147 And I'm so embarrassed.
###149 
###154 BILLIE JD PORTER: Could you name every
###155 celebrity you've ever met?
###157 HARVII: Oh, god.
###158 [INTERPOSING VOICES]
###160 HARVII: Oh, god.
###160 That would take ages.
###162 Selina Gomez, Black Eyed Peas, Lilly Allen, Bono.
###167 Beyonce, Kesha, Taylor Swift, Justin Beiber, Pussy Cat
###172 Dolls, all the Cyrus', High School Musical cast, Demi
###178 Lovato, Aly & AJ--
###179 
###183 I honestly can't think now.
###185 I would say I'm happy.
###187 BILLIE JD PORTER: What would make you happier?
###190 HARVII: Being famous.
###192 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###203 FEMALE SPEAKER: We just have fun because we're the best.
###205 [INTERPOSING VOICES]
###207 MALE SPEAKER: I'm here today to audition for Big Brother.
###209 The last one, so I thought I'd give it to go.
###211 And this year is my third year.
###213 And I haven't been onto the rest of the show, so I thought
###216 more chance of getting through.
###217 MALE SPEAKER: I love my job at the moment, [INAUDIBLE].
###220 But I also do want to be a DJ as well.
###222 FEMALE SPEAKER: I can't sing.
###223 I can dance.
###224 I can kick box really well.
###226 I don't really stand out at anything I do, really.
###230 FEMALE SPEAKER: I just want to be famous, have the fame and
###233 fortune and the parties.
###234 MALE SPEAKER: But you know, just would be quite cool, you
###236 you're walking down the street and you have
###238 people recognize you.
###239 MALE SPEAKER: For me, I think I'm really cool and funny.
###241 And I just think it would be an amazing experience to do.
###244 FEMALE SPEAKER: I think, yeah, that we're a bit rambunctious.
###246 FEMALE SPEAKER: No, I'm actually flamboyant.
###248 Antidisestablishmentarianism.
###251 MALE SPEAKER: Well, I'm going to take
###252 every possible advantage.
###253 I'm going to go to the premiers.
###254 I'm going to try and go to parties.
###256 If I can get myself on TV shows, I'll do them.
###258 FEMALE SPEAKER: You know, everybody these days wants to
###259 have their 15 minutes of fame, or even one minute of fame.
###262 You know, and I think it's the lifestyle that comes with it.
###267 FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.
###267 We want to marry Jedward.
###268 FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah, Jedward.
###269 I'm after John.
###270 FEMALE SPEAKER: Edward, holler.
###272 
###275 We're going to have a joint marriage with John and Edward.
###277 FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah, John and Edward, the little blondies
###279 from Ireland.
###280 FEMALE SPEAKER: Yes.
###281 No, they're from Rome.
###282 FEMALE SPEAKER: They're from Ireland, you idiot.
###284 FEMALE SPEAKER: No, they're from Rome.
###285 FEMALE SPEAKER: Well, shit.
###287 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###293 HARVII: We're in Soho, love it.
###295 Do you know what I can't wait for?
###297 Sex and the City premier.
###299 Me and mum, trying to get tickets.
###300 We're like such big fans of them.
###303 I've met Kim Cattrall.
###304 And I've seen Sarah Jessica Parker.
###306 But Sarah Jessica Parker basically, I saw
###310 her outside the hotel.
###310 I was waiting for her.
###311 And I was like, Sarah, Sarah, please.
###313 And she was like, I'm sorry.
###314 I've got to go in.
###314 And then guess what?
###315 My friend, Sommer, doesn't even like her.
###317 She got a photo in the restaurant.
###319 I was so P'd off.
###320 But Sarah was actually really in a hurry.
###322 She had to, like, get ready and shit.
###324 Then she quickly went into a restaurant for some champagne.
###326 I was like so P'd off because they got a
###328 photo and I love her.
###330 BILLIE JD PORTER: From the first day we spent with
###331 Harvii, him and his cousin, Cassie, took us to a hotel in
###334 Soho where we waited all day for various celebrities.
###337 Slowly, more of his friends began to turn up, all of whom
###340 he had met through a shared love of celeb hunting.
###342 HARVII: I love Two and a Half Men!
###346 She's on Carnation Street.
###347 Hi!
###348 [INTERPOSING VOICES]
###349 
###351 BILLIE JD PORTER: It didn't seem to matter
###352 who a person was.
###353 As long as they were famous, Harvii wanted a picture.
###356 [INTERPOSING VOICES]
###357 
###361 HARVII: Cassie.
###362 No, I don't remember his name.
###365 I don't remember his name.
###366 I know him.
###366 I just don't remember his name.
###367 
###370 CASSIE: He's from [INAUDIBLE].
###371 
###376 [INTERPOSING VOICES]
###378 GROUP: Bye.
###379 HARVII: Bye.
###380 Can I see my photo?
###381 FEMALE SPEAKER: Chloe.
###381 HARVII: Cassie, come in.
###384 MALE SPEAKER: How do you take the picture?
###386 HARVII: You see, because of your fun I didn't get one of
###387 him looking in the camera.
###389 Because you think I'm getting one of my--
###390 [INTERPOSING VOICES]
###391 
###393 HARVII: Oh, I've got to the ugliest photo.
###396 CASSIE: It's nice.
###397 HARVII: I go the horriblest photo.
###399 BILLIE JD PORTER: It turned out that Cassie was also a big
###401 fan of Megan Fox.
###402 CASSIE: Well, I've got a lotus flower.
###404 And it's a beautiful flower.
###406 And M.F. is meant to be for Megan Fox.
###409 Because I just love Megan a lot.
###411 And I just thought a tattoo would always
###413 remind me of Megan Fox.
###415 It's just a special thing.
###416 So I don't know.
###418 It's a bit over the top, maybe.
###421 BILLIE JD PORTER: But what do you say when people
###422 ask you about it?
###425 CASSIE: I could make it up if I wanted to, but if I didn't--
###428 [INTERPOSING VOICES]
###429 BILLIE JD PORTER: Ask what's that M.F. for?
###430 And you're like, Megan Fox.
###431 Then they'd just laugh.
###432 CASSIE: I don't know.
###433 It depends on the person, I guess.
###434 
###441 BILLIE JD PORTER: This first portrait is Andrea Corr.
###443 I had that done in '98.
###446 And Iron Maiden, my favorite band.
###448 The [INAUDIBLE]
###449 is my second favorite band.
###452 Anastasia, she's very down to earth, very normal, or seems
###455 to be, comes across that way.
###457 Ozzy, yeah, again, he sees just nuts, a logical choice.
###462 So I've got eight of the cast members of Buffy.
###464 Suzi Quatro, I had the Doris Day one done on my calf.
###468 Dee Snider, Tim Curry as Frank N Furter from Rocky Horror.
###472 Shania Twain, which I'm not sure I'm going to get that one
###475 signed, but maybe one day.
###478 
###481 BILLIE JD PORTER: Steve Porter is hoping to break the world
###483 record for signed celebrity tattoos.
###486 We visited him at his home just outside Nottingham.
###490 How much money do you think you've spent on
###491 tattoos over the years?
###494 STEVE PORTER: $3-4,000, I'd have thought.
###496 BILLIE JD PORTER: Is it worth it?
###498 STEVE PORTER: Is anything worth it in the long run?
###501 I might needs to filet a bit more.
###503 BILLIE JD PORTER: No, it's perfect.
###504 Thanks.
###504 STEVE PORTER: Big spoon for you.
###506 BILLIE JD PORTER: What things has this kitchen seen, aye?
###509 STEVE PORTER: Cooking.
###510 
###514 STEVE PORTER: Cooking.
###515 Nah.
###517 I've got their maids.
###519 BILLIE JD PORTER: Really?
###522 STEVE PORTER: I've got maids, but I haven't--
###523 I don't mix up much.
###526 
###528 Except for the Rocky Horror and Maiden concerts.
###531 
###537 Basically, Billy Conway, I've always liked.
###539 Finally we've decided it needs to be done.
###542 He's another one of the gods.
###543 And he's probably one of the best comics ever.
###546 BILLIE JD PORTER: Yeah.
###546 STEVE PORTER: And he's very natural and down to earth.
###549 
###552 MARC FAIRBURN: Famous people?
###554 No chance.
###555 BILLIE JD PORTER: Why's that?
###555 MARC FAIRBURN: Why would I want that?
###559 STEVE PORTER: I can put my ass a bit further back.
###562 MARC FAIRBURN: No farting while I work.
###565 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###580 STEVE PORTER: That photo there looks like Rob Zombie.
###583 MARC FAIRBURN: Yeah.
###583 That's all right then?
###585 STEVE PORTER: I always have faith in Marc.
###586 
###590 BILLIE JD PORTER: We met Danilo outside a theater in
###592 Soho as he waited for hours in this snow, hoping to catch a
###595 glimpse of one of his favorite celebrities.
###597 [CROSS TALK]
###601 
###612 
###617 
###626 
###661 BILLIE JD PORTER: We joined Danilo at to his London home
###663 as he prepared a gift for his favorite Spice Girl, Melanie
###665 C.
###667 
###671 
###674 
###687 
###690 
###698 
###721 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###732 BILLIE JD PORTER: What do you think about people who dress
###733 like the celebrities they admire?
###736 HARVII: I love it.
###739 I think it's great.
###740 I love people who do it.
###742 Because it kind of shows that they're a big fan.
###745 SAM ROBINSON: I got my name changed from Sam Robinson to
###750 Sam La Roux Robinson.
###753 I'm 18 and I work for Tony & Guy in Hall Hempstead.
###757 I got that on, I think it was my 18th birthday or a couple
###763 of days after.
###764 And then I got the other one.
###767 Well, I got that one, which is the cameo that she wears.
###771 And a couple of months after, then I got
###774 that one of La Roux.
###778 She's a really big inspiration.
###781 Like, to me, she kind of made me come out of
###783 myself a bit more.
###784 It's like, I'm more confident now that I've met her.
###788 Well, not met her, but her music.
###792 I brought back five them.
###795 La Roux mug still in the--
###798 Just got that for Christmas.
###799 It's like, awesome.
###801 If I was going out and like, really want to kind of look
###805 like La Roux, I'd kind of wear a pair of these with that and
###810 maybe a t-shirt that I've got of David Bowie.
###814 And I'd wear that.
###815 I've got this shirt, like, tucked in.
###817 If I wear my hair, because my hair's really curly.
###820 If I just wear it curl, I'll still get a
###822 lot of La Roux comments.
###823 And it's just like, I don't even look like her today.
###827 Yeah, that was on or around the first July.
###831 That's a t-shirt I made as well.
###834 I just made it off Vistaprint.
###836 I just got a picture.
###837 I just made it.
###838 
###842 SAM ROBINSON: No.
###842 It's the end of the month.
###844 I can't afford to.
###846 SAM ROBINSON: Marlboro Ultra Lights.
###847 MALE SPEAKER: Oh, OK.
###848 SAM ROBINSON: They're expensive.
###849 NIKOLA ROBINSON: Well, I definitely encourage Sam.
###853 Him and his brother, I've just brought them up to just to be
###855 themselves.
###857 If he wants to wear something really outrageous and go out
###859 in full makeup with a 10-foot quiff then that's up to him.
###863 If he wants to get La Roux tattooed on
###865 him, then so be it.
###867 I wouldn't ever not encourage him.
###870 Yeah.
###870 No, Sam's my best friend.
###872 We do everything together.
###874 And I'm a lot closer than, not closer, but he's very
###877 different to my older son who just doesn't need me and moved
###880 out of home when he was 16.
###882 And it's a very different relationship.
###885 But yeah, he's my best friend.
###887 
###894 SAM ROBINSON: My dad lives in Hatfield, which is quite far
###897 away from where, like, we live.
###900 Don't talk to him at all.
###901 He totally cut me out of his life when I
###903 told him I was gay.
###904 And just said some horrible stuff to me.
###909 So I was just like, no.
###910 I think I've always been like that, just fuck you.
###913 I'm going to look like this.
###913 And I'm going to look the way I like.
###915 And it just kind of, you know, it did kind of
###918 spiral out of control.
###919 But it's still under control if you know what I mean.
###924 DANILO FIORIN: I'm back here tonight to deliver of my
###926 painting for Melanie C. Let's see if we are lucky.
###930 [CROSS TALK]

###983 BILLIE JD PORTER: Melanie, what do you
###983 think of Danilo's painting?
###985 MELANIE C.: It's brilliant.
###986 It's so nice.
###987 You know, we get given lots of gifts.
###988 But when something's being made by my somebody it's
###991 always extra special.
###992 
###994 MELANIE C.: I think it's a bit crazy.
###996 But I think all tattoos are crazy when people get them.
###998 DANILO FIORIN: But I have the cross the same as you.
###1001 MELANIE C.: Do you?
###1002 Wow.
###1003 Wow.
###1004 [CROSS TALK]
###1005 MELANIE C.: All right,guys.
###1006 So good to see you all.
###1006 Take care.
###1007 DANILO FIORIN: Thank you, ma'am.
###1008 [CROSS TALK]
###1012 MALE SPEAKER: Take care, Melanie.
###1014 DANILO FIORIN: She's so lovely every time.
###1017 BILLIE JD PORTER: How do you feel?
###1019 DANILO FIORIN: I'm shaking.
###1022 I'm really, really, really happy.
###1024 I think she did like my painting.
###1027 Let's see if she answers my letter.
###1031 I don't know.
###1033 I don't know how to start actually but I'll try to skip
###1037 the silly words, OK.
###1039 Well, you have been the inspiration of my life.
###1042 Well, you with the other girls, Emma,
###1045 Victoria, Mel B., and Geri.
###1048 As I have been lucky of meeting you a few times
###1051 already, I put all my trust on you as you
###1054 are my Northern star.
###1056 You know me because of my Viva Forever tattoos.
###1060 Remember, you signed it?
###1061 And I have tattooed it on me.
###1063 You saw it.
###1065 So I have the others Spice Girls tattoo it as well.
###1068 And I have been trying hardly to meet them.
###1071 So I can get my autographs tattooed then so I can finish
###1075 this tattoo thing and finally be able to say I have done the
###1080 dream of my life, meet the Spice Girls.
###1083 I know you have a busy life, but it would mean the world to
###1087 me if I can get this help from you.
###1090 I leave here my email address, mobile, just in case.
###1096 You know when my dream should come true.
###1098 Love you, kisses.
###1100 
###1106 STEVE PORTER: Well, basically I've just come down from Knox
###1107 again to get a tattoo which was done on Saturday of Billy
###1111 Conway signed.
###1111 With a bit of luck, it's seems he's just been playing at
###1114 [INAUDIBLE].
###1115 And it's been a long day trying to get it sorted.
###1119 BILLIE JD PORTER: Although we weren't able to film the
###1120 encounter, Steve was successful in getting the
###1123 tattoo signed.
###1125 STEVE PORTER: He loved it.
###1126 He loved it showing all the management and everything.
###1129 So it seemed to go really, really well.
###1133 Well worth the trip.
###1134 
###1137 STEVE PORTER: Yeah.
###1137 It's them authenticating it.
###1140 Saying that, yeah, I like the tattoo.
###1142 So I like it.
###1143 So I'll sign it.
###1144 And that's what it's all about.
###1145 If they don't like it, they don't sign it.
###1147 Simple as that.
###1149 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###1160 STEVE PORTER: So originally I was going to try and do Remi,
###1162 and Billy Conway took over.
###1164 So yeah.
###1165 I believe Remi will be the next one if he finds
###1168 somewhere for him.
###1170 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###1177 [CROSS TALK]
###1182 [BEEPING]
###1182 HARVII: Wait.
###1183 I know what Sarah Jessica Parker's car is, actually.
###1186 It's BBM.
###1187 
###1189 I chased her down Paul Street two years ago.
###1193 [CROSS TALK]
###1195 HARVII: Sarah Jessica Parker's on.
###1198 How do we get in?
###1200 Are you serious?
###1202 
###1206 [CHEERING AND SCREAMS]
###1215 HARVII: [INAUDIBLE]
###1217 [CHEERING AND SCREAMS]
###1225 
###1232

###1260 
###1278 
###1282 HARVII: Hello, Maria.
###1283 Have you met them?
###1284 MARIA (OFFSCREEN): A while ago.
###1285 HARVII: Did you get photos?
###1287 We're at the premier.
###1288 I've got the Empire.
###1290 I can't meet then.
###1291 
###1293 Because I'm at the Empire, not the Odeon.
###1295 I can't go down the red carpet.
###1296 I just saw Kim Cattrall.
###1297 I can't get in.
###1298 
###1301 
###1304 BILLIE JD PORTER: Harvii seemed very distressed at
###1306 being unable to meet the cast.
###1307 So we tried to cheer him up with some ice cream.
###1310 
###1316 HARVII: Well, at this moment in time, yes.
###1318 Because I know I'll get upset.
###1321 Because they'll be done, she'll run off and just say
###1323 [INAUDIBLE].
###1325 
###1328 Melanie and Tamara, I'm not going to meet you.
###1332 Of course, I'll try.
###1333 But I won't get anywhere near them.
###1336 I think I've just ruined everything.
###1338 BILLIE JD PORTER: Later that evening, we found out where
###1340 the cast was staying.
###1341 But when we invited Harvii to come with us, he declined.
###1345 
###1360 [CROSS TALK]
###1363

###1424 MALE SPEAKER: All right.
###1424 You've got it now.
###1425 Guys, you got it!
###1426 You got it!
###1427 BILLIE JD PORTER: What makes you so happy about getting
###1428 photos of somebody you don't know?
###1431 HARVII: I honestly do not know.
###1433 It's just, like a feeling.
###1435 BILLIE JD PORTER: Could you describe the feeling?
###1438 HARVII: It's a good one.
###1439 It's like a tingly kind of thing.
###1442 It just, like, makes you, how could you say it, like, more
###1444 alive or something like that.
###1446 And it's fun doing at the end of the day.
###1450 And I don't want to be doing it until my 30s and 40s like
###1454 still people do now as a fan.
###1457 I don't think it will go away.
###1459 I just think I will want to give it up.
###1461 
###1464 BILLIE JD PORTER: So what do you do then?
###1465 MALE SPEAKER: I'm a painter/decorator.
###1467 MALE SPEAKER: And when did this hobby start?
###1470 MALE SPEAKER: When did it first start with you?
###1471 I think it was--
###1472 MALE SPEAKER: A few years ago.
###1473 MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.
###1475 MALE SPEAKER: Started up with me imagining
###1476 a theatre in Epsom.
###1477 And it sort of escalated from there.
###1479 MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.
###1480 And once you meet one--
###1482 MALE SPEAKER: It just goes on and on.
