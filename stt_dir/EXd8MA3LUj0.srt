chaos in Ukraine--

ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER:
This is Gold's Gym.


7

It's not a baby gym.

JACOB SOBOROFF: --and the
world's first hybrid super car.

JACOB SOBOROFF: Alexander
Kulabuhov posted a video


13
0:0:19,1 --> 0:0:21,54
from Kiev on Sunday that you
have absolutely got to see.


14
0:0:21,54 --> 0:0:23,41
The massive
demonstrations in Ukraine


15
0:0:23,41 --> 0:0:26,33
escalated last weekend after
controversial new anti-protest


16
0:0:26,33 --> 0:0:27,4
laws were passed.


17
0:0:27,4 --> 0:0:29,43
ALEXANDER KULABUHOV: Right
now I'm breaking the law.


18
0:0:29,43 --> 0:0:32,476
Because recently the
government took the law


19
0:0:32,476 --> 0:0:37,61
that if you wear a helmet-- a
helmet-- it's against the law


20
0:0:37,61 --> 0:0:39,19
and you are going to jail.


21
0:0:39,19 --> 0:0:40,275
JACOB SOBOROFF: This all
started two months ago


22
0:0:40,275 --> 0:0:42,4
when President Yanukovych
refused a trade agreement


23
0:0:42,4 --> 0:0:44,53
from the EU and accepted
aid from Russia.


24
0:0:44,53 --> 0:0:46,37
Alexander is doing
something so important.

0:0:46,37 --> 0:0:49,134
He is dedicating his channel to

JACOB SOBOROFF:
This is an extremely


32
0:1:3,2 --> 0:1:5,186
complicated and volatile
situation, something that's


33
0:1:5,186 --> 0:1:6,75
definitely worth
paying attention to.

at Gold's Gym


38
0:1:13,75 --> 0:1:14,97

And he's disguising
himself, but not really.


40

ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER: Remember
we do everything in reps.


41
0:1:19,41 --> 0:1:21,21
So you've done two
reps of water drinking.


42
0:1:21,21 --> 0:1:22,92
Usually we do 10
reps of everything


43
0:1:22,92 --> 0:1:24,835
so do another rep
of water drinking.


44
0:1:24,835 --> 0:1:26,61
Stand up straight.


45
0:1:26,61 --> 0:1:27,11

46
0:1:27,11 --> 0:1:28,26
Rep number seven.


47
0:1:28,26 --> 0:1:32,37
You have elbows and you
have knees, so touch them.

You can have 900 horsepower, and
you can have an electric mode


61

you don't want to burn gas.

of a Toyota Yaris.

like I want to be intoxicated
but I'm really not.

been posting blogs since 2007.

And actually he was the first
Brit to hit 1 million subs.


100
0:3:26,287 --> 0:3:28,62
In March he challenged himself
to make five short films.


101

"Offline" was his second,
and he just the making of.

CHARLIE MCDONNELL: The truth is
that I hated editing this film.


103
0:3:33,982 --> 0:3:35,69
When I got home and
looked at the footage


104
0:3:35,69 --> 0:3:37,59
that I had and tried to
put something together,


105
0:3:37,59 --> 0:3:38,89
I just didn't think
it was any good.


106
0:3:38,89 --> 0:3:40,431
And so I did the
worst possible thing


107
0:3:40,431 --> 0:3:41,78
you can do when you're scared.


108
0:3:41,78 --> 0:3:42,8
I ran away.


109
0:3:42,8 --> 0:3:45,4
And I hoped the film
would edit itself.

glad you did edit it, man.

see the next one.

greatest hits.

moving than nostalgia
