0:0:20,55 --> 0:0:21,875
Hi, I'm Ken Jeong.


3
0:0:21,875 --> 0:0:24,481
And it's one of my favorite
party stories ever, from my


4
0:0:24,481 --> 0:0:24,96
bachelor party.


5
0:0:24,96 --> 0:0:27,4
I used to be a physician before
I became an actor.


6
0:0:27,4 --> 0:0:29,44
All of my friends were doctors,
and on my bachelor


7
0:0:29,44 --> 0:0:30,37
party we went to Vegas.


8
0:0:30,37 --> 0:0:32,299
And you couldn't get somebody
more geeky and more


9
0:0:32,299 --> 0:0:35,7
ill-equipped to party in Vegas
than me and my crew.


10
0:0:35,7 --> 0:0:37,1
Then went to a strip club.


11
0:0:37,1 --> 0:0:41,58
And the strippers couldn't be
less threatened by us or less


12
0:0:41,58 --> 0:0:42,63
turned on by us.


13
0:0:42,63 --> 0:0:44,82
Just imagine a bunch of
doctors having no


14
0:0:44,82 --> 0:0:45,99
idea how to have fun.


15
0:0:45,99 --> 0:0:48,29
You've got these big
tittied women just


16
0:0:48,29 --> 0:0:49,34
grinding on your laps.


17
0:0:49,34 --> 0:0:50,7
You have no idea what to do.


18
0:0:50,7 --> 0:0:54,55
And then one of my friends was
getting a lap dance, and the


19
0:0:54,55 --> 0:0:56,96
stripper was complaining
of some stomach


20
0:0:56,96 --> 0:0:57,96
pains she had had.


21
0:0:57,96 --> 0:0:59,27
And my buddy was like,
what do you think


22
0:0:59,27 --> 0:1:0,265
it could be, Miracle?


23
0:1:0,265 --> 0:1:1,2
It is your gallbladder?


24
0:1:1,2 --> 0:1:2,79
Have you had your appendix
taken out?


25
0:1:2,79 --> 0:1:4,879
And he actually figures out
that the stripper has got


26
0:1:4,879 --> 0:1:6,1
irritable bowel syndrome.


27
0:1:6,1 --> 0:1:9,27
And I literally hear him
going, well, you know,


28
0:1:9,27 --> 0:1:11,4
Miracle, in irritable
bowel you get


29
0:1:11,4 --> 0:1:12,76
constipation and diarrhea.


30
0:1:12,76 --> 0:1:14,86
An hour later, there's literally
like a line of


31
0:1:14,86 --> 0:1:17,14
chicks just waiting
to be examined.


32
0:1:17,14 --> 0:1:19,2
And he's like, oh, that's
a yeast infection.


33
0:1:19,2 --> 0:1:19,76
But that's, OK.


34
0:1:19,76 --> 0:1:22,13
It doesn't mean you're
bad person, honestly.


35
0:1:22,13 --> 0:1:24,78
I worry about STDs, so may want
to take some doxycycline,


36
0:1:24,78 --> 0:1:25,55
Sweet Sensation.


37
0:1:25,55 --> 0:1:27,41
Oh, you're just pregnant.


38
0:1:27,41 --> 0:1:28,53
You're just pregnant.


39
0:1:28,53 --> 0:1:30,37
And they're asking, so
when's the big day?


40
0:1:30,37 --> 0:1:31,11
Where are you going?


41
0:1:31,11 --> 0:1:32,12
Oh, New Zealand?


42
0:1:32,12 --> 0:1:33,24
Oh, that's awesome.


43
0:1:33,24 --> 0:1:36,39
It just felt like a group of
friends, except our friend are


44
0:1:36,39 --> 0:1:38,24
just grinding on us.


45
0:1:38,24 --> 0:1:39,84
So at the end of the night,
it was just so pleasant.


46
0:1:39,84 --> 0:1:42,39
We hugged it out, and we
went on our merry way.


47
0:1:42,39 --> 0:1:44,64
Oh, and my buddy wrote a
prescription for irritable


48
0:1:44,64 --> 0:1:45,53
bowel syndrome.


49
0:1:45,53 --> 0:1:47,9
You don't want a
gassy stripper.


50
0:1:47,9 --> 0:1:47,85
It was one of the
funniest [BLEEP]


51
0:1:47,85 --> 0:1:48,77
nights of my life.


52
0:1:48,77 --> 0:1:50,93
We were out of our element, and
we went back to what we do


53
0:1:50,93 --> 0:1:52,43
best, being dorks.


54
0:1:52,43 --> 0:3:52,43
