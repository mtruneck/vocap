###68 He's coming! He's coming!
###102 All right, now.
###104 Let's give a good Colorado welcome here!
###111 - Hello, sir. You're most welcome. - Thank you, thank you.
###114 All right, everybody, listen up.
###116 I want to introduce you to Oscar Wilde.
###123 Welcome to the Matchless Silver Mine.
###126 Today, we opened up a new seam.
###129 We're gonna name it after you.
###131 How very kind.
###133 I look forward to collecting the royalties.
###138 Now, why don't you follow me over here.
###140 Great lecture you gave last night. We're honored to have you visit us.
###146 If you'd just like to step in here. There ya go, sir.
###170 I thought I was descending into hell...
###172 but with these angel faces to greet me, it must be paradise.
###176 Is this the way to my personal seam?
###179 Of course, I should have preferred gold... purple and gold.
###182 But we live in a Silver Age, alas.
###186 So much that is exquisitely beautiful is wrought from suffering, from pain...
###190 from toil... broken bones and blistered skin.
###194 Benevenuto Cellini understood silver.
###197 He took the metal that you mine so nobly down here...
###199 and transformed it into works of art for popes and princes.
###203 Cellini... is he a wop?
###205 The Renaissance man, in every sense.
###208 The greatest silversmith the world has ever seen...
###211 but a genius in life as well as art.
###213 He experimented with every vice known to man.
###217 - He committed murder. - He killed a man?
###219 More than one.
###226 Thank you.
###230 I'd like to meet Cellini. Why didn't you bring him with you?
###233 I'm afraid he's dead.
###235 Who shot him?
###292 Is Miss Lloyd connected to Lloyd's Bank?
###297 A pity.
###299 But she's comfortable, Ada.
###301 A thousand a year.
###303 Then I congratulate you, Lady Wilde.
###305 Now that Oscar's been to America and sown his Wildean oats...
###309 it's time he settled down.
###311 But weren't they very rough?
###312 No, charming. Well, charming to me.
###315 With each other, it's true they could be a little brusque.
###317 They hanged two men in the theater one night before I gave a lecture.
###320 I felt like the sorbet after a side of beef.
###326 I know your friend is famous, Ada... notorious, at least...
###330 but I don't understand for what.
###332 For being himself, Lady Mount-Temple.
###336 Don't Americans talk the most wonderful slang, though?
###338 Well, I did hear one lady say...
###340 "After the heel-lick I shifted my day goods."
###343 What on earth did she mean?
###346 She meant that she changed her clothes after a dance.
###349 Connie, my love, Lady Mount-Temple is so anxious to meet you.
###354 I knew your father, Miss Lloyd.
###356 She's delightful, and not stupid. Really, not stupid at all.
###360 Is that quite a reason to marry her?
###363 Well, I must marry someone.
###367 And my mother has our future planned out in every detail:
###370 I'm to go into Parliament, we're to have a nice house...
###374 and live a proper, settled life... literature, lectures...
###376 the House of Commons, receptions for the world in general at 5:00.
###380 How dreary.
###381 Your attendance will not be required at those.
###384 But your sphinxiness will be essential for our intimate little dinners at 8:00.
###387 It will be a grand life, a charming life.
###391 I see Constance will be busy preparing the dinners...
###394 but what will she contribute to the literature and lectures?
###396 She'll correct the proofs of my articles.
###398 Oh, what a little sunbeam.
###408 I do love her, Ada. She's...
###412 Silent.
###414 - I find her very silent. - But so sympathetic.
###418 And I do need an audience.
###458 I don't see how you can possibly take it all in, reading at that speed.
###463 Try me.
###464 I know better.
###471 Where are we dining tonight?
###473 At the Leversons.
###475 Then you must show your true colors as a propagandist for dress reform.
###479 The cinnamon cashmere trousers, I think.
###482 And the cape with the ends that turn up into sleeves.
###485 I don't think I can wear those trousers anymore.
###496 A new Wilde for the world!
###498 Another genius for Ireland!
###503 We shall have to buy you a whole new wardrobe.
###516 Ernest proposed to me under that statue.
###518 Really, the things that go on in front of works of art are quite appalling.
###522 The police should interfere.
###524 We were made not to marry, whereas you and Constance are so happy.
###528 Everyone says so.
###529 It's perfectly monstrous how people say things behind one's back...
###532 that are absolutely true.
###535 So your audience has proved as responsive as you hoped?
###539 Receptive, yes. Responsive?
###542 I always wonder what she's thinking.
###544 I expect it's about the baby.
###547 Yes. Well, Constance is such a natural mother.
###550 She's invited Robbie into the nest while his parents are abroad.
###555 Robbie is Canadian. You can tell by his youth.
###559 Have you been brought to England to mature, Mr. Ross?
###562 Well, that was the idea, but it doesn't seem to be working.
###566 I've lived here since I was three, and you see the pitiful result.
###570 Robbie comes from a long line of imperial governors.
###572 His grandfather was Prime Minister of Upper Canada.
###575 Or was it Lower Canada?
###576 The British will take their class system with them wherever they go.
###579 They apply it even to continents.
###581 Are you planning to govern a continent?
###583 No. I don't even plan to govern myself.
###594 Very nicely turned leg.
###597 Hello, sir.
###601 Shall I give you these, my love? I'll see if I can find a cab.
###604 Coming through there, gents. Mind your backs.
###617 Can you move out of the way, please?
###629 Looking for someone?
###635 Cab, cab!
###646 Bedtime.
###648 Just one more cigarette.
###656 No. No, thanks, Robbie.
###664 Don't stay up too late, Robbie.
###667 Good night.
###673 Good night, Oscar.
###676 Good night, Robbie.
###694 He's asleep.
###700 He's so beautiful.
###705 Almost as beautiful as his mother.
###710 I don't know what I'd do without you, my constant Constance.
###735 Good night, my dear.
###738 Good night.
###760 A university education is an admirable thing, of course...
###763 so long as you remember that nothing worth knowing can ever be taught...
###766 least of all at Cambridge.
###768 But you told me...
###770 in ancient Greece the older men taught the younger.
###774 They drew them out.
###777 I look forward to being drawn out immensely.
###781 Yes, well, Greek love... platonic love...
###784 is the highest form of affection known to man, of course.
###788 You also told me...
###790 that the Greeks put statues of Apollo in the bride's chamber...
###793 so she would have beautiful sons.
###797 But I can't help noticing that here the statue's in your bedroom.
###804 Constance prefers a bath.
###823 She was so beautiful when I married her, Robbie.
###826 Slim, white as a lily...
###829 such dancing eyes.
###831 I've never seen such love in a pair of eyes.
###834 She was...
###868 Nothing should reveal the body...
###871 but the body.
###875 Didn't you say?
###886 There has to be a first time for everything, Oscar...
###893 even for you.
###903 <i>Hush. There's a good little fellow.</i>
###907 Come on. Come on, now. There.
###911 Now, come on, Cyril. It's time for your bath.
###914 Be a good boy. Don't make such a fuss!
###919 You've got to get undressed. Come on.
###922 I know you hate it.
###924 Boys, Mrs. Wilde, they never do what they're told.
###927 Oh, we're going to have a girl next time.
###931 - Aren't we, Oscar? - I must go.
###937 Good night, my dear. Now you behave, Cyril.
###940 Remember, a gentleman should take a bath at least once a year.
###944 - Good night. - Come on, Cyril.
###946 It's not that bad.
###948 I shan't be back till late. I'm dining with the Asquiths.
###951 Hush now.
###953 Come on, now.
###993 Do you love me?
###996 I feel...
###998 like a city that's been...
###1001 under siege for 20 years.
###1005 Suddenly the gates are thrown open...
###1008 and the citizens come pouring out...
###1013 to breathe the air and walk the fields...
###1016 and pluck the wildflowers.
###1020 I feel...
###1023 relieved.
###1028 You don't worry about Constance?
###1032 <i>"Every afternoon, on their way home from school...</i>
###1034 <i>the children used to play in the garden of the selfish giant. "</i>
###1037 Is that the garden where we play?
###1039 No, this is much larger and lovelier than that, with soft green grass.
###1044 There's grass where we go.
###1046 Yes, but are there 12 peach trees that burst into delicate blossoms...
###1049 of pink and pearl every springtime and bear rich fruit in the autumn?
###1052 Are there, Mama?
###1054 I don't think there are, Cyril, no.
###1057 Would you hand me a matchstick, and I'll put this hussar's head back on?
###1061 Thank you.
###1067 "The birds sat on the trees and sang so sweetly...
###1070 that the children used to stop their games to listen.
###1073 'How happy we are here,' they said to each other."
###1075 I don't know how they could be happy if there was a giant.
###1078 There wasn't, you see, not yet. He was away, visiting a friend.
###1082 You're always away.
###1085 Yes, but I only go for a night or two at a time, and I always come back.
###1089 Whereas this giant, the one whose garden it was...
###1091 he'd been away for seven years, staying with an ogre in Cornwall.
###1094 "And after seven years, when he'd said all he had to say...
###1097 because his conversation was very limited...
###1101 he decided to return home to his own castle.
###1104 When he found the children playing in his garden, he was very angry.
###1108 'What are you doing here? ' he cried.
###1111 And all the children ran away.
###1113 'My own garden...
###1115 is my own garden! ' Said the giant.
###1118 'And I won't allow anyone to play in it except myself.'
###1122 So he built a high wall all around...
###1124 put up a large notice board on which was written, in capital letters:
###1128 'Trespassers will be prosecuted."'
###1132 Arthur, you're trespassing. Cyril will now eat you.
###1135 It's Mr. Ross, sir, with Mr. Gray.
###1138 Heavens, I must fly.
###1140 The horses of Apollo are pawing impatiently at the gates.
###1143 I beg your pardon?
###1144 Papa must go.
###1149 You will come back and finish the story?
###1152 Of course I will.
###1154 Come on, Cyril. It's almost teatime.
###1158 I really don't know why people bother painting portraits anymore.
###1161 You can get a much better likeness with a photograph.
###1166 A photograph's just one moment in time...
###1168 one gesture, one turn of the head.
###1170 Yes, portraits are not likenesses, Mr. Gray.
###1174 Painters show the soul of the subject, the essence.
###1177 The essence of the sitter's vanity, you mean.
###1179 Well...
###1181 this is a portrait of Lady Battersby as a young woman.
###1186 She's over there, as a matter of fact.
###1189 I must go and console her.
###1198 How nice to see you.
###1200 Poor thing.
###1202 I expect in her heart...
###1204 she thinks she still looks like this.
###1206 If we could look young and innocent forever...
###1209 Do you think we'd want to?
###1212 If our souls were ugly, yes.
###1214 Give a man a mask, and he'll tell you the truth.
###1220 Have we had enough of this? Shall we go and have dinner somewhere?
###1263 <i>Dorian Gray is the most wonderful book I've ever read.</i>
###1267 <i>And the end, when the servants break in...</i>
###1270 and they find him wizened, old and dead...
###1273 and the picture young again...
###1276 I fainted.
###1278 My family say it's dull and wicked.
###1280 Dull?
###1290 It's sublime.
###1293 It's about the masks we wear as faces...
###1298 and the faces we wear as masks.
###1303 That my son should have written a work of such...
###1306 People say it's full of dangerous paradoxes.
###1310 Hardly anyone will speak to us anymore.
###1314 We're ceasing to be respectable.
###1319 Artists care nothing about respectability.
###1324 It's only jealousy.
###1326 It's the spite of the untalented for the men of genius.
###1334 Where is Oscar?
###1336 He's in the Lake District, writing a play.
###1339 - A drama? - A comedy.
###1343 Robbie Ross has gone to keep him company.
###1347 I do like Robbie.
###1350 And they both love you.
###1353 Oh, it'll be a great success.
###1356 Oscar's made for the stage.
###1373 - Author! Author! - Author!
###1384 Oscar, please!
###1386 - Magnificent! - Well done, everybody.
###1404 Ladies and gentlemen, I have enjoyed this evening immensely.
###1409 The actors have given us a charming rendering of a delightful play...
###1413 and your appreciation has been most intelligent.
###1417 I congratulate you on the great success of your performance...
###1420 which persuades me that you think almost as highly of this play...
###1423 as I do myself.
###1437 Absolutely splendid, Oscar. An absolute triumph!
###1440 - Thank you so much. Thank you. - Well done.
###1443 How sweet of you to say so.
###1446 It went so well, Oscar.
###1449 Even better than I'd...
###1452 They loved it. They absolutely loved it.
###1454 And I, dear boy, love you.
###1457 Congratulations, Oscar.
###1458 Thank you.
###1460 It's good to see you.
###1462 Hello.
###1465 Mr. Wilde. Wonderful, really wonderful.
###1467 - Oscar. - Sphinx!
###1469 You really must be careful. You're in grave danger of becoming rich.
###1475 - It was wonderful. I knew it would be. - Thank you, Robbie.
###1479 Everyone's dying to know who the real Lady Windermere is.
###1481 The real Lady Windermere is every woman in this room, and most of the men.
###1484 - Oscar! - Lionel!
###1486 It's a wonderful play.
###1488 My cousin Lord Alfred Douglas is here.
###1490 He would like very much to congratulate you.
###1504 - Wonderful. - Oscar, this is Bosie Douglas.
###1507 We met last year. Lionel brought me to tea at Tite Street.
###1511 How could I possibly forget?
###1517 I love your play.
###1519 The audience didn't know whether you meant your jokes or not.
###1521 You shocked them...
###1523 especially with your speech.
###1526 But the more frivolous you seem, the more serious you are, aren't you?
###1529 - I love that. - Thank you.
###1532 I always say, the young are the only critics...
###1534 with enough experience to judge my work.
###1536 - Splendid, Oscar. - We need shocking.
###1539 People are so banal. And you use your wit like a foil.
###1542 You cut through all those starched shirt fronts.
###1546 You draw blood. It's magnificent.
###1549 I wish you'd draw some blood down in Oxford...
###1552 though you'd need a miracle.
###1554 All the dons at my college have dust in their veins.
###1557 At which college do you educate the fellows?
###1560 Magdalen.
###1562 My own college.
###1564 I shall claim the privilege of a graduate and take tutorials with you.
###1569 Come soon, then. They're threatening to send me down.
###1572 How could they be so cruel to one so beautiful?
###1581 Dons... they're so middle class.
###1584 Oscar, you've shocked the whole of London, smoking on stage like that.
###1588 Excellent. Then we shall run for a year.
###1590 Oscar, you must say something to Marion Terry.
###1593 She was good, wasn't she?
###1595 So good, I think she wrote most of the lines herself.
###1598 - Excuse me, Lord Alfred. - Bosie, please.
###1607 - You must be so thrilled, Oscar. - I know.
###1609 Isn't it humiliating?
###1611 <i>" 'My own garden is my own garden, ' said the giant.</i>
###1616 So he built a high wall all round it...
###1619 and put up a notice board:
###1621 'Trespassers will be prosecuted.'
###1625 He was a very selfish giant.
###1628 The poor children had now nowhere to play.
###1631 They tried to play on the road...
###1633 but the road was very dusty and full of hard stones, and they did not like it.
###1637 They used to wander round the high wall when their lessons were over...
###1640 <i>and talk about the beautiful garden inside.</i>
###1644 <i>'How happy we were there, ' they said to each other. "</i>
###1648 I hope he was a very beautiful boy.
###1652 Well, pretty, you know, in a street-Arab sort of way.
###1657 There's no point being blackmailed by an ugly one.
###1666 What's tiresome is he's threatened to show my letters to my father.
###1670 Who will show them to all his friends for the excellence of their style.
###1675 You don't know him. He's a brute.
###1679 Really. He carries a whip wherever he goes.
###1686 He used to beat my mother.
###1689 He beat my brothers. He thrashed me from the age...
###1692 My dear boy.
###1696 Of course, he's practically illiterate.
###1701 He probably won't understand the letters anyway.
###1703 By an unforgivable oversight, I've never been blackmailed myself...
###1706 but my friends assure me that a hundred pounds will usually suffice.
###1709 Really?
###1711 God, l... You promise?
###1713 Leave it to Lewis... George Lewis... my solicitor.
###1717 He knows what he's doing. He acts for the Prince of Wales.
###1729 <i>Leave me not to pine</i>
###1731 <i>Alone and desolate</i>
###1736 <i>No fate seem fair as mine</i>
###1741 <i>No happiness</i>
###1745 <i>So great</i>
###1747 Isn't he killing, Mr. Wilde?
###1749 <i>- And nature day by day - He's perfect.</i>
###1752 He's perfect in every way.
###1755 <i>In accents clear</i>
###1759 <i>This joyous roundelay</i>
###1765 <i>He loves me</i>
###1768 <i>He is here</i>
###1778 <i>He loves me</i>
###1783 <i>He is here</i>
###1797 That was lovely. Well done, Bosie.
###1799 Yes, absolutely enchanting.
###1800 More tea, anyone?
###1888 I don't want to sit here. I want to sit there.
###1891 You heard what Lord Alfred said.
###1895 I want everyone to look at us.
###1897 I want everyone to say, "Look, there's Oscar Wilde with his boy."
###1910 So, what shall we let people see us eating?
###1914 Fois gras and lobster and champagne.
###1917 For two. We do everything together.
###1920 Very good, Mr. Wilde.
###1930 I think he enjoyed thrashing me.
###1933 All my family are mad.
###1937 My uncle slit his throat last year in a railway hotel.
###1942 Which station?
###1945 Euston.
###1948 All life's really serious journeys involve a railway terminus.
###1954 And now I must go to the station myself.
###1958 Sarah Bernhardt thinks she knows better than I do how to play Salome.
###1961 Stay.
###1964 Please stay.
###1968 At least till this evening.
###1973 Sarah is divine, as you are.
###1976 She will be wonderful at the play's climax when Salome kisses the lips...
###1980 of the severed head ofJohn the Baptist.
###1983 "Ah, thou wouldst not suffer me to kiss thy mouth, Jokanaan."
###1986 Jokanaan is an old Hebrew name forJohn.
###1989 "Well, I will kiss it now.
###1992 I will bite it with my teeth as one bites a ripe fruit.
###1995 Yes, I will kiss thy mouth, Jokanaan.
###2000 Thy body is white like the snows that lie on the mountains...
###2004 <i>like the snows that lie on the mountains ofJudea...</i>
###2007 <i>and come down into the valleys.</i>
###2010 <i>The roses in the garden of the queen of Arabia...</i>
###2013 <i>are not so white as thy body. "</i>
###2023 <i>I'm not good enough for him anymore.</i>
###2028 I'm just the son of a carpenter, while Bosie...
###2030 Oscar's only ever been smitten before.
###2035 He was smitten with me. He was smitten with you.
###2039 I wasn't smitten.
###2046 I loved him.
###2048 Well, now he's fallen in love.
###2053 I'm halfway to hellfire. I'm not joking.
###2058 Someone else was a carpenter's son.
###2063 I've given in and become a Catholic.
###2067 I find confession...
###2069 wonderfully consoling.
###2071 I can't go to confession...
###2074 when I want to kill Bosie...
###2079 or myself.
###2089 - Oscar's furious. - He has no right to be.
###2092 He knew perfectly well the Lord Chamberlain would never allow...
###2095 a play with biblical characters.
###2097 Oscar doesn't think there should be censorship of plays at all.
###2099 Of course there must be censorship.
###2101 Or people would say what they meant, and then where should we be?
###2105 - When is he coming to join us? - He's not.
###2108 He must stay and look after Lord Alfred.
###2110 Those Douglases are always ill, when they're not demented.
###2113 One of them roasted a kitchen boy on a spit.
###2115 And Bosie's father, Lord Queensberry...
###2118 he's a dreadful man, Constance...
###2121 eoesn't believe in God or marriage.
###2123 A marquis should set a proper example...
###2126 or what are the upper classes for?
###2129 I tell you...
###2131 I wouldn't want a daughter of mine to marry a Douglas.
###2137 I haven't got a daughter.
###2139 Plenty of time still, my dear.
###2148 I see.
###2151 It's my fault.
###2154 After Vyvyan was born, all I could think of was the children.
###2160 So that's why Oscar spends so much time with his men friends.
###2164 Oscar needs disciples.
###2167 Lord Alfred's a poet. A very fine poet, Oscar says.
###2170 He's studying classics. Oscar and he talk about Plato.
###2177 There's nothing wrong.
###2179 Really, there isn't.
###2181 It's not whether there is anything wrong.
###2183 It's whether or not there appears to be.
###2186 That's all people care about.
###2188 The empire was not built by men like Bosie Douglas.
###2194 <i>"Then the spring came...</i>
###2198 <i>only in the garden of the selfish giant it was still winter.</i>
###2201 <i>The birds did not care to sing in it, as there were no children.</i>
###2204 <i>And the trees forgot to blossom.</i>
###2207 <i>The snow covered up the grass with her great white cloak...</i>
###2210 <i>and the frost painted all the trees silver. "</i>
###2267 Let's go out.
###2268 If you like.
###2275 The thing about renters is you don't have to consider their feelings.
###2278 But if someone is willing to give one pleasure, one should show gratitude.
###2282 No. Money, that's all they want.
###2285 What's wonderful about going to Taylor's is no one pretends.
###2289 You just do it and be done with it.
###2299 I do love you, Oscar.
###2303 But variety is the spice of life.
###2310 You can watch me, if you like.
###2314 <i>You must attempt to keep a grasp upon your sobriety.</i>
###2318 That is disgusting. We'll have less of that.
###2322 - Good evening. - Lord Alfred.
###2324 Alfred Taylor, this is Oscar.
###2326 Delighted to make your acquaintance, Oscar.
###2329 Charles Parker. I remember you.
###2332 Hello, Oscar.
###2334 Charming to see you again.
###2341 - Do you smoke? - I do everything.
###2343 - Yeah, everything that pays. - Expertly, I might add.
###2350 Mr. Wilde, some wine.
###2352 Thank you.
###2354 - It's a nice case. - I want you to keep it.
###2360 Thank you.
###2362 So, this is a den of vice. I should call it more of a garden.
###2366 Such pretty flowers, Mr. Taylor.
###2369 How wise of you to keep the curtains closed.
###2371 They would never grow in the common light of day.
###2373 - Who are you calling common? - Certainly not you, dear boy.
###2376 You seem to be a flower of the rarest hue.
###2389 Bosie never told me that you were a botanist, Mr. Taylor...
###2392 that you roam the earth, climbing the highest peaks of the Himalayas...
###2396 and plunging into the darkest forests...
###2398 of Borneo to return triumphant...
###2401 to this delightful conservatory in the shadow of Westminster Abbey...
###2404 to exhibit your specimens.
###2407 The boys are all Londoners, actually.
###2410 Impossible. I see Londoners every day...
###2413 but never such exotic blooms as these.
###2416 Does he always talk like this?
###2419 Not when he's in bed.
###2431 <i>I am discreet.</i>
###2433 <i>Bosie is far too grand for that. He wants everyone to know.</i>
###2438 - You must understand... - I must be with young people, Robbie.
###2441 They're so frank and free.
###2443 They make me feel young myself.
###2445 That's all very well, but what would you say...
###2448 if someone wanted to go to bed with your son?
###2451 Cyril's eight.
###2452 What will you say when he's 18?
###2458 Nothing. He must do as his nature dictates...
###2462 <i>as I only wish I had done.</i>
###2464 "'I do believe the spring has come at last,' said the giant.
###2468 He jumped out of bed, and looked out of the window."
###2471 - What did he see? - You tell me.
###2474 No, you tell it.
###2475 All right. "He saw the most wonderful sight.
###2479 Through a little hole in the wall...
###2481 the children had crept back into the garden and were sitting...
###2484 on the branches of the trees.
###2486 And every tree that he could see, there was a little child.
###2489 The trees were so glad that they..."
###2491 They covered themselves with blossoms!
###2493 Blossoms!
###2495 "And were waving their arms gently above the children's heads.
###2498 And the birds were twittering and singing above them with delight.
###2502 And the flowers were looking up through the grass and laughing.
###2506 Oscar, it's time the boys changed, or we'll miss the train.
###2510 Come on, boys.
###2512 Papa, can't we stay?
###2515 Papa's got to work. He's got to finish his play.
###2519 Yes, poor dear Papa.
###2520 Poor Papa.
###2523 Poor, poor, poor, poor, poor Papa.
###2529 <i>Where is Oscar? We haven't seen him at all.</i>
###2532 Where do you think he is? He's working. He is a writer, after all.
###2535 I hear your father's threatening to shoot Lord Roseberry.
###2537 Really? He usually prefers the horsewhip.
###2541 Says he's been buggering your brother.
###2543 Well, Roseberry is Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs...
###2547 and Francis is his private secretary.
###2549 Actually, Francis is about to get engaged.
###2552 What's your father talking about, then?
###2556 He's obsessed with sex.
###2558 He thinks Oscar's buggering me...
###2560 as though I'd allow anyone to do that.
###2575 I'm sick of the country.
###2581 Let's get back to London.
###2588 What's the point of us living together if you're always working?
###2591 - I have responsibilities... a family. - God, not that again!
###2597 I ask my friends over from Oxford, and you just disappear.
###2605 I'd be better off staying at my mother's.
###2608 - At least she's there. - You asked me to take this house...
###2611 Now I'm bored with it.
###2613 - And with you. - I can't give it up.
###2617 It's paid for in advance. Until I finish my new...
###2622 Bosie, dear...
###2623 you have beauty, you have breeding...
###2626 and, most glorious of all, you have youth.
###2628 But you are very fantastical if you think that pleasures...
###2631 don't have to be earned and paid for.
###2634 Whenever I want to do anything, you say you can't afford it...
###2638 but you give all those renters cigarette cases.
###2640 But I've lavished presents on you!
###2642 Every penny I've earned from my play I have spent on you!
###2645 I'm sure you've been counting.
###2648 You're so mean and penny-pinching...
###2651 and middle-class, all you can think about is your bank balance.
###2654 For God's sake! This is intolerable!
###2656 No gentleman ever has the slightest idea what his bank balance is!
###2662 You're absurd!
###2664 Telling everyone how they ought to live.
###2666 You're so vulgar!
###2669 I never want to see you again, ever.
###2672 All right, then. If that's what you want, then you go!
###2675 Get out!
###2681 <i>"But in the farthest corner of the garden...</i>
###2683 <i>it was still winter, and in it was standing a little boy.</i>
###2688 <i>He was so small, he could not reach up to the branches of the tree.</i>
###2692 <i>'Climb up, little boy, ' said the tree.</i>
###2695 <i>But the little boy was too tiny. "</i>
###2699 Egypt is lovely this time of year.
###2702 - But you mustn't idle your time away. - Mother.
###2705 And I want you to promise me something:
###2710 Not to write to Oscar Wilde.
###2713 I can't do that. I love Oscar.
###2717 I love him as a disciple loves his teacher.
###2720 But he's not fit to teach anything. He's evil.
###2723 Do you really think your own son could love someone evil?
###2728 I just wish I could love Oscar as loyally, devotedly...
###2731 unselfishly and purely as he loves me.
###2737 But I'm not as good as he is.
###2741 I probably never will be.
###2746 Good-bye, then.
###2763 <i>"I adore simple pleasures.</i>
###2765 <i>They are the last refuge of the complex.</i>
###2768 But, if you wish, let us stay here.
###2770 Yes, let us stay here.
###2773 <i>The Book of Life begins with a man and a woman in a garden."</i>
###2776 "It ends with 'Revelations."'
###2778 Yes. Mr. Tree, may I?
###2781 I'm delighted, of course, that you find my lines funny...
###2784 but please don't try and make the audience laugh with them.
###2786 They should sound completely spontaneous and natural...
###2789 as though people spoke like that all the time.
###2791 Yes, of course.
###2794 Let's try again.
###2797 You should break with Bosie more often, Oscar.
###2799 Then we'd have more of your spontaneous and natural plays.
###2804 Bosie was envious. That's why he stopped Oscar working.
###2807 - That's not true. - Of course it is.
###2809 His poems aren't nearly as good as you pretend...
###2812 and he knows it.
###2814 - He's just a shallow little... - Rivulet.
###2820 Bosie's a child, a vulnerable child. He needs love.
###2823 We all need love.
###2826 But which of us can give it?
###2828 <i>Wish you a merry Christmas</i>
###2831 <i>We wish you a merry Christmas</i>
###2836 <i>And a happy New Year</i>
###2839 <i>Good tidings we bring</i>
###2842 <i>To you and your kin</i>
###2844 <i>We wish you a merry Christmas</i>
###2847 <i>And a happy New Year</i>
###2850 - Cracker time! - It is cracker time.
###2853 I won this time. Look. There. One for you, one for me.
###2856 <i>"And the giant's heart melted as he looked out.</i>
###2859 <i>'How selfish I have been, ' he said.</i>
###2863 <i>'Now I know why the spring would not come here.</i>
###2866 <i>I will put that little boy on top of the tree...</i>
###2868 <i>and I will knock down the wall, and my garden shall be...</i>
###2871 <i>the children's playground forever and ever. '</i>
###2874 <i>He was really very sorry for what he had done. "</i>
###2878 This is really nice, even though...
###2881 <i>"So he crept downstairs and opened the front door quite softly...</i>
###2885 <i>and went out into the garden.</i>
###2891 <i>That he did not see the giant coming.</i>
###2894 <i>And the giant stole up behind him and took him gently by the hand...</i>
###2898 <i>and put him up into the tree.</i>
###2900 <i>And the tree broke at once into blossom...</i>
###2902 <i>and the birds came and sang on it, and the little boy...</i>
###2905 <i>stretched out his two arms...</i>
###2907 <i>and flung them round the giant's neck...</i>
###2910 <i>and kissed him. "</i>
###2945 I don't care what people think. I love you.
###2948 It's all that matters to me. It was agony being away from you.
###2951 Well, here I am.
###2953 Oh, Bosie, you're my catastrophe, my doom.
###2956 Everyone says so, even me.
###2959 I missed you.
###2963 I thought you might like something to celebrate your return.
###2973 When I saw them in the window, they begged me on their knees...
###2976 to make them yours.
###2979 I'll put them on now. They're superb.
###2997 - I'll sit there. I want a proper table. - Is there something wrong, my lord?
###3001 This young fool wants me to sit by the service door.
###3004 Oh, God, my father.
###3006 I'm extremely sorry. He's new, and he didn't know who you were.
###3011 Bosie, you're not going to flee.
###3019 Give me the menu.
###3025 I'll have the pea soup and then the salmon.
###3028 Will you have it with us, Papa?
###3032 I'm lunching with Oscar Wilde. Will you join us?
###3040 I told you never to see that vile cur again.
###3042 He's not vile or a cur. He's utterly delightful. Come and see.
###3048 How do you know what he's like when you've never met him?
###3053 You're not a man to be influenced by other people's opinions.
###3064 Oscar, you've never met my father, have you?
###3068 Lord Queensberry.
###3073 Bosie has told me so much about your exploits on the racetrack.
###3079 I've never heard such bad luck as yours with the Grand National.
###3083 Bosie tells me that you would have won...
###3086 but that your cousin wouldn't let you ride the horse?
###3090 Bloody fool said I was too old.
###3093 Why, you're never too old. I'd ridden Old Joe on the gallops.
###3097 Came in at 40 to 1.
###3099 No horse could ever have carried me over the jumps, I fear.
###3102 What are you having?
###3104 - Pea soup and salmon. - Then I shall join you.
###3107 Spring is the time to lunch on salmon...
###3109 though I always think it tastes so much nicer if you've caught it yourself.
###3113 You fish?
###3115 I used to when I lived in Ireland.
###3117 My father had the most charming hunting lodge...
###3119 on an island in a lake.
###3122 - Do you know the west of Ireland? - Not really.
###3129 Whereabouts, exactly?
###3145 The Christians go around pretending they know who God is and how He works.
###3148 I've got no time for that tomfoolery.
###3151 If you don't know something, you should stand up and say so...
###3154 not go around pretending you believe in some mumbo jumbo.
###3157 I can believe in anything, provided it's incredible.
###3160 That's why I intend to die a Catholic, though I couldn't possibly live as one.
###3164 Catholicism is such a romantic religion. It has saints and sinners.
###3169 The Church of England only has respectable people...
###3171 who believe in respectability.
###3174 You get to be a bishop not by what you believe but by what you don't.
###3178 That's true enough.
###3180 It's the only church where the skeptic stands at the altar...
###3183 and St. Thomas the Doubter is prince of the apostles.
###3186 No, I couldn't possibly die in the Church of England.
###3190 Where do you stand on cremation?
###3193 I'm not sure I have a position.
###3198 I'm for it.
###3200 I wrote a poem:
###3202 "When I am dead, cremate me."
###3206 That's how it begins.
###3208 "When I am dead, cremate me."
###3211 What do you think of that for an opening line?
###3215 It's challenging.
###3217 I'm a challenging sort of man.
###3219 That's why people don't like me.
###3221 I don't go along with the ordinary ways of thinking.
###3224 Then we are exactly alike.
###3227 Another glass of brandy?
###3229 I find that alcohol, taken in sufficient quantities...
###3232 can produce all the effects of drunkenness.
###3237 You were there for ages.
###3239 You stayed talking till after 4:00. I knew you'd like him.
###3243 Well, he's got charm, I admit that.
###3246 But that's bad.
###3248 Men shouldn't be charming.
###3250 It's disgusting. I don't think much of his action.
###3252 Let's have a look at the bay.
###3255 Mind you, Wilde's no fool.
###3258 Talks wonderfully, really wonderfully.
###3260 But that means nothing when what he says is such rot.
###3264 Worse than rot... evil.
###3267 Which is why I insist you stop seeing him forthwith.
###3269 "Insist"? What's that supposed to mean?
###3271 It means I will cut off your allowance if you don't do as I say.
###3276 - Trot him up and down a bit! - Look, Father.
###3279 You wasted time at Oxford pretending you were going into the Foreign Office.
###3282 Thank God you didn't when thatJew queer Roseberry...
###3285 can become Foreign Secretary and bugger all the juniors, including your brother.
###3288 That's all lies.
###3289 You spent your whole time writing obscene poetry.
###3292 My poems aren't obscene.
###3293 They're in the manner of Wilde. That's filthy enough for me.
###3296 Have you ever actually read any of Oscar's poems?
###3299 I wouldn't sully my mind with perverted trash like that.
###3303 Tell him to pick his feet up!
###3305 He's not straight!
###3307 Are you calling Oscar a pervert?
###3309 Because that's libelous.
###3311 I'm not saying he is one. I'm saying he's posing as one...
###3315 which is worse.
###3317 His wife's divorcing him.
###3319 Did you know that? For sodomy!
###3323 - That's completely untrue! - I hope it is.
###3326 Because if it were true, I'd shoot him on sight.
###3332 You will cease to see Wilde, or I'll cut you off without a penny.
###3338 As though I wanted your money...
###3340 what little you have left from your tarts.
###3344 How dare you speak to your father like that.
###3347 What a funny little man you are.
###3351 Come back here, you filthy-minded sissy!
###3354 You're absurd!
###3356 And you're nothing but a bum-boy!
###3358 You're pathetic!
###3364 I'm a bloody good shot. Better than he is.
###3366 I'll shoot him through the heart if he threatens me.
###3368 Hadn't you better use a silver bullet then?
###3371 Here's one for the Black Douglas.
###3373 Bosie, for God's sake!
###3375 And one for his liver! One for his lights!
###3377 One for his stinking rotten soul!
###3383 I'll save one for myself.
###3386 My own father... he wants to kill me.
###3405 My life is everything I ever wanted.
###3408 I have fame.
###3412 I have recognition.
###3414 With two plays about to open in London...
###3417 I may even have money.
###3421 The world is at my command...
###3425 yet I can't command myself.
###3429 I can't command my feelings for you.
###3445 <i>- Thank you. - Constance, my dear.</i>
###3448 How nice.
###3460 I brought you your letters.
###3463 You haven't been home for so long.
###3466 Thank you.
###3473 It's so much more convenient for Oscar living in the West End...
###3475 when he has a play coming on.
###3478 I'm like a northern businessman keeping an eye on his factory.
###3481 The boys ask for you all the time.
###3484 They're longing to see you.
###3487 Oscar has to make sure the play's a success, Constance.
###3490 I'll come round this afternoon...
###3492 for tea.
###3496 It's the dress rehearsal this afternoon.
###3502 Tomorrow then. I'll come tomorrow.
###3504 Well, tomorrow then.
###3514 Good-bye, my dear.
###3517 Good-bye.
###3525 Good-bye, Constance.
###3537 - Something like that. - I'm not trying to get anything.
###3539 I hope so. It would be rather fun. Perhaps a codfish.
###3543 Codfish. I've a strong feeling that codfish live rather deeper.
###3546 - Do you think we'll have skate... - Possibly.
###3553 I don't think there'll be anything for our table tonight, my love. No luck.
###3558 I think I'd better stay. You're getting a cold.
###3560 No, no. I'm all right. Let's get the boys some ices.
###3564 - Boys, you stay and look after nanny. - Oh, all right.
###3569 We'll look after nanny.
###3571 I could take the boys to the dentist on Thursday on their way back to school.
###3575 But the whole point of them having dentistry now...
###3577 is so they can stuff themselves with sweets for a week before we lose them.
###3584 - Are you quite sure? - Bosie'll look after me.
###3609 Get your coat on, quick!
###3611 I've got a present for you!
###3615 Oh, God.
###3617 - You're not still seedy, are you? - Bosie, where have you been?
###3620 I've had no one to talk to, no one to look after me.
###3623 Don't be so pathetic. I've found you the divinest boy.
###3626 - Bosie, you promised Constance... - Bugger Constance.
###3629 I'm not your nanny. Come on. We're going out.
###3632 Bosie, please.
###3636 You look such an idiot lying there. Revolting.
###3640 - Have you forgotten how to wash? - As a matter of fact...
###3642 I'm dying for a glass of water.
###3646 - You know where the jug is. - Bosie, darling.
###3649 It stinks in here. You'll be wanting me to empty your chamber pot next.
###3653 Well, I emptied your chamber pot. I looked after you.
###3657 Well, I'm not looking after you. Not now.
###3659 You don't interest me. Not when you're ill.
###3662 You're just a boring middle-aged man with a blocked-up nose.
###3665 - Bosie, dearest boy. - Shut up!
###3669 "Dearest boy, darling Bosie." It doesn't mean anything.
###3673 You don't love me. The only person you've ever loved is yourself.
###3676 You like me. You lust after me.
###3679 You go about with me because I've got a title. That's all.
###3683 You like to write about dukes and duchesses...
###3686 but you know nothing about them.
###3687 You're the biggest snob I've ever met...
###3689 and you think you're so daring because you fuck the occasional boy.
###3693 Please, you're killing me.
###3695 You'll just about do when you're at your best.
###3697 You're amusing... very amusing... but when you're not at your best, you're no one.
###3701 All I asked for was a glass of water.
###3706 For Christ's sake! There you are then!
###3712 Now will you shut up about the fucking water?
###3720 There are two boys waiting out there.
###3722 If you're not coming, I'll fuck them both myself.
###3725 I'll take them to the Grand and fuck them in front of the whole hotel...
###3729 and I'll send you the bill.
###3747 Drink this.
###3749 - It will help your fever. - He's ashamed of loving men.
###3757 His father bullies him, his mother spoils him...
###3760 and then berates him for being spoiled.
###3762 Neither of them gives him any real love. They're torturing him.
###3768 And what's truly dreadful is that when...
###3772 he can't bear it and has one of his...
###3776 he becomes exactly like his father.
###3778 - And he hates himself for that. - You're too kind about him.
###3784 You can't be too kind about someone who's been so hurt.
###3790 Yet if I go on trying to come between Bosie and his father...
###3796 that'll destroy me.
###3798 Bosie's quite capable of destroying you on his own.
###3802 Look how much you wrote while he was away.
###3805 Two wonderful plays which will run for years.
###3808 Back comes Bosie, and what have you written since?
###3819 You know how much I...
###3823 Iove and admire you...
###3828 but you're throwing your genius away.
###3830 - For what? - It's highly ironic.
###3834 Queensberry thinks Bosie and I are locked in nightly embrace...
###3838 and in reality, we've been the purest model of Greek love since...
###3844 Bosie doesn't like doing it with me, but I've loved him.
###3849 - I've educated him. - But he's never grown up.
###3854 And he never will.
###3857 I'm not taking him back, Robbie.
###3860 Not again.
###3864 I can't.
###3866 I've been very foolish, very fond...
###3870 but now I must grow up myself.
###3873 Oh, please, don't do that.
###3876 You're an artist. Artists are always children at heart.
###3882 Oh, Robbie, I sometimes I wonder if...
###3888 Back page, sir.
###3896 My God. Francis Douglas.
###3899 - What? - Bosie's brother.
###3901 He's been found shot. He's dead.
###3907 But he's just got engaged.
###3912 Poor, poor Bosie. He'll be utterly distraught.
###3927 <i>He killed himself.</i>
###3930 It was my father. He drove him to it.
###3933 I'm sure your father's just as upset as everyone else.
###3938 No, he's not.
###3943 He says it's a judgment on Roseberry and my mother...
###3947 and me and you.
###3959 We've got to stop him, Oscar...
###3963 before he drives my whole family to suicide.
###3969 I promise you, I won't let him hurt you ever again.
###3972 I promise.
###3981 It's not enough. I want him stopped.
###3987 I want the whole world to know what he's done...
###3993 what an evil man he is.
###4000 Table, my lord?
###4001 Is Lord Alfred here? And that shit and sod Wilde?
###4004 No, my lord. Not tonight.
###4007 Bugger must be at Kettner's.
###4024 Is my son staying here?
###4028 Is Lord Alfred Douglas staying here?
###4031 No, sir, he's not.
###4035 - What about Wilde? - No, sir.
###4041 If I find they have been staying here...
###4045 I'll give you the biggest whipping of your life.
###4081 Well, I expect you two would like a drink after your exertions.
###4093 I must ask you to leave, Mr. Wilde.
###4095 My dear man, what are you talking about?
###4098 At once, please.
###4102 What's the matter? My father cracking the whip downstairs, is he?
###4118 - My lord. - Bosie.
###4120 You're not frightened of what this little man thinks, are you?
###4123 I think the pleasures of the evening should be resumed elsewhere.
###4132 You're such a coward.
###4134 You say you despise convention...
###4136 but you're the most conventional man I know.
###4140 Come on then. If we're going, let's go.
###4151 Until tomorrow, Tommy.
###4154 Good-bye, sir.
###4156 I goes in, and there's all this tropical fruit laid out.
###4164 Wait a minute, Oscar!
###4167 Alfred, how nice to see you. And Charlie, looking so well.
###4171 I'm afraid I'm busy this evening, but we must have dinner again soon.
###4173 It's not a question of dinner. I got a letter of yours to Lord Alfred.
###4179 It's a nice letter, Oscar. Beautiful.
###4182 "Lips like roses. The madness of kisses in ancient Greece."
###4186 Then I expect it's one of my prose poems.
###4188 There's a gentleman's offered me 60 pounds for it.
###4189 Then you must accept, Alfred. I've never received so large a sum...
###4192 for a prose work of that length in all my life.
###4195 Tell him I'm delighted that someone in England values my work so highly.
###4198 - Well, he's gone away. - He's gone to the country.
###4200 Well, I'm sure he'll be back soon.
###4205 Oscar, look. You couldn't let us have something, could you?
###4210 Bit short at the moment. You know.
###4214 Of course. Of course.
###4217 Here's half a sovereign. Now you mind you take good care of that letter.
###4219 Lord Alfred is going to publish it in sonnet form in his new magazine.
###4224 For fuck's sake.
###4229 It's no good trying to rent you.
###4231 You just laugh at us.
###4234 - Here. - Thank you.
###4237 He can be very careless, Lord Alfred.
###4242 What a wonderfully wicked life you lead.
###4244 You boys. You boys.
###4251 - Where is he? - Mr. Wilde is not receiving visitors.
###4254 - Where is he? - He's busy, sir. I cannot...
###4257 I wish you would get out of my way. Get out of my way!
###4262 Excuse me, sir, there's a gentleman...
###4264 You!
###4267 Listen to me.
###4270 You're a bugger!
###4274 I don't allow people to talk to me like that in my house, Lord Queensberry...
###4277 or anywhere else.
###4280 I suppose you've come to apologize for the lies you've been spreading about me?
###4283 I've come to tell you to leave my son alone, you sodomite.
###4287 The marquis appears to be very obsessed with other people's sexual activities.
###4291 Has it anything to do with his new wife...
###4293 I wonder, and the fact that she's seeking divorce for non-consummation?
###4297 Unless you swear that you'll have nothing more to do with Bosie...
###4300 I shall go to Scotland Yard.
###4302 You can go to the devil.
###4304 You and your... Who is this gargoyle?
###4307 You're a queer! And a sham! A poseur!
###4311 If I catch you and Bosie together again, I'll give you such a thrashing.
###4316 I believe Lord Queensberry once invented some rules for boxing.
###4319 I've no idea what they are...
###4321 but the Oscar Wilde rule is to shoot on sight.
###4323 - Now, kindly leave my house. - You can shut up!
###4326 I shall leave when I'm damn well ready.
###4333 It's a scandal what you've been doing.
###4336 All the scandal is your own.
###4339 Your treatment of your wives...
###4342 your neglect of your children...
###4344 and, above all, the depraved insistence...
###4347 that they be as tyrannical and unloving as you are yourself.
###4352 Arthur, this is the Marquis of Queensberry...
###4355 the most infamous brute and the least tender father in London.
###4360 Never let him into my house again.
###4365 Very well then.
###4369 Let's get out of this stew.
###4417 - Out of the way, then! - I'm sorry, sir!
###4419 I'm very sorry, but it's just not possible!
###4429 What are you doing? Rotten vegetables?
###4432 Give that to Oscar Wilde.
###4434 Thank you, sir. We'll take care of it.
###4437 I wanted to give it to him personally as a bouquet.
###4442 I daresay you did, sir, but you're not going to.
###4447 He's a cur and a sod!
###4451 And a bugger!
###4452 You remember that!
###4457 I always told you, Gwendolen, my name is Ernest, didn't I?
###4460 Well, it is Ernest after all.
###4462 I mean, it naturally is Ernest.
###4466 Yes, I remember now that the general was called Ernest.
###4469 I knew I had some particular reason for disliking the name.
###4475 Ernest! My own Ernest!
###4479 I knew from the first you could have had no other name.
###4482 Gwendolen, it's a terrible thing for a man to find out suddenly...
###4486 that all his life he's been speaking nothing but the truth.
###4490 Can you forgive me?
###4492 I can, for I feel you are sure to change.
###4495 - My own one! - Laetitia.
###4498 Frederick! At last!
###4500 - Cecily! At last! - Gwendolen! At last!
###4505 My nephew, you seem to be displaying signs of triviality.
###4511 On the contrary, Aunt Augusta...
###4513 I've now realized for the first time in my life...
###4516 the vital importance of being earnest.
###4548 Allen, you were wonderful! Thank you all so much.
###4550 They're calling for you. You must come on. Curtain, curtain.
###4553 - No, no, George, no, no. - Come on!
###4603 - Mr. Wilde, sir. - Yes?
###4608 - For you. - Thank you.
###4621 "For Oscar Wilde...
###4625 Ponce," is it?
###4626 "Ponce and 'somdomite."'
###4629 "Posing as a sodomite." He's illiterate... illiterate, ignorant.
###4633 - It's hideous. - We've got him now, Robbie.
###4636 He wrote it down. The porter read it.
###4638 That makes it a public libel. Now we can take him to court.
###4641 For God's sake.
###4646 Oscar, you mustn't do that. That would be... I mean...
###4649 We've just been waiting for a chance to get him in the dock...
###4652 and show the world what a swine and shit he's always been.
###4655 - To me, my mother, my brothers. - But he'll plead justification.
###4659 He'll call all the renters as witnesses for the defense.
###4662 Of course he won't. He doesn't know what a renter is.
###4665 I hear he's had detectives following you ever since you came back from Egypt.
###4669 He can't prove anything. But we can.
###4673 We can prove he's the vilest man that ever walked the earth.
###4675 Tear the card up, Oscar. Pretend you never got it.
###4677 Are you mad? That's our main piece of evidence.
###4681 I'm sure if Oscar went abroad for a few months...
###4683 lived on royalties while your father calms down...
###4685 - Whose side are you on? - Bosie, if this goes to court...
###4688 Oscar will have to tell lies...
###4690 perjure himself... everything will come out.
###4693 Whatever the result, it will be utter disaster.
###4696 You're an enemy then.
###4698 No, no, Bosie, please. Robbie...
###4702 you're a dear boy, but I can't even think of leaving the country.
###4705 As a matter of fact, I can't even leave this hotel. I can't pay the bill.
###4711 We can raise you money, for heaven's sake.
###4714 Anyway, what about your royalties?
###4716 We shall need all the money we can get for the libel case.
###4719 My father can't go on making all our lives a torment like this.
###4724 Oscar, I beg you.
###4727 I'm not going to run away, Robbie.
###4729 I'm not going to hide. That would be the English thing to do.
###4732 If you take Queensberry to court, all hell will break loose.
###4736 All my life I've fought against the English vice:
###4740 Hypocrisy... not that that's the point.
###4743 The point is, Queensberry's already caused the death of one of his sons.
###4747 If I don't try and stop him now, whom will he harm next?
###4753 <i>He's avoiding me, Robbie.</i>
###4756 I know what everyone's saying, but it's not true.
###4760 It's not true.
###4764 - Is it? - Of course not.
###4768 Oh, it's so shaming.
###4772 No, I find it easier to stand.
###4777 I'm going to Torquay for a month, try to get my back right.
###4781 - Oscar's been so busy... - I'm sure he'll be terribly upset...
###4785 when he knows you've been in so much pain.
###4789 The truth is, I need some money.
###4793 Not even sure where he is to ask for it.
###4797 It does seem rather hard when he's having such an extraordinary success.
###4800 I think I can find him.
###4806 I keep hearing these stories about Bosie and his father.
###4808 - I'm sure you don't want to... - Oh, yes. I do.
###4814 Men think women should be protected by not knowing.
###4819 Not knowing only makes it worse.
###4824 Is there going to be trouble?
###4829 I hope not.
###4833 <i>I believe a prosecution would certainly succeed...</i>
###4836 provided... and I stress this...
###4838 provided there is no truth whatever in the accusation made by Lord Queensberry.
###4842 Of course there's no truth in it.
###4846 Then so long as I have Mr. Wilde's assurance that that is indeed the case.
###4861 There is no truth in the accusation whatever.
###4864 Good. Excellent.
###4870 The defense, I understand, will be led by Mr. Edward Carson.
###4874 Old Ned? I was at college with him in Dublin.
###4878 No doubt he will perform his task with all the bitterness of an old friend.
###4884 In writing a book or a play, I'm concerned entirely with literature...
###4887 with art... I do not aim at doing good or evil...
###4891 but at making a thing that will have some quality of beauty.
###4894 Well, listen, sir. Here is one of your pieces of literature.
###4899 "Wickedness is a myth invented by good people...
###4902 to account for the curious attractiveness of others."
###4909 Do you think that true?
###4911 Oh, I rarely think anything I write is true.
###4913 "If one tells the truth, one is sure, sooner or later, to be found out."
###4922 That is a pleasing paradox, but I do not set store by it as an axiom.
###4926 Is it good for the young?
###4928 Anything is good that stimulates thought, at whatever age.
###4931 Whether moral or immoral?
###4933 There's no such thing as morality or immorality in thought.
###4936 What about this then?
###4939 "Pleasure is the only thing one should live for."
###4944 I think that the realization of one's self is the prime aim of life...
###4948 and that to realize through pleasure is finer than to do so through pain.
###4952 I am, on this point, entirely on the side of the ancients, the Greeks.
###4959 <i>How long have you known Alfred Taylor?</i>
###4962 <i>About two years, two-and-a-half years.</i>
###4965 - Is he an intimate friend of yours? - I wouldn't call him that, no.
###4969 But you went often to his rooms?
###4972 About seven or eight times, perhaps.
###4974 Did you know Mr. Taylor kept ladies' dresses in his rooms?
###4981 Did you know he was notorious for introducing young men to older men?
###4986 I never heard it in my life.
###4990 Has he introduced young men to you?
###4993 Yes.
###4995 - How many young men? - About five.
###4998 - What were their occupations? - I really don't know.
###5003 Oh, well, let me tell you, Mr. Wilde.
###5006 You met a man called Charles Parker there, I believe.
###5010 Yes.
###5011 Charles Parker is...
###5014 a gentleman's valet.
###5017 You met his brother there too, I believe.
###5019 - Yes. - He is a groom.
###5024 I didn't care tuppence what they were.
###5026 I liked them. I have a passion to civilize the community.
###5031 I recognize no social distinctions at all of any kind.
###5035 To me, youth... the mere fact of youth...
###5038 is so wonderful that I would sooner talk to a young man for half an hour...
###5042 than, well, than be cross-examined in court.
###5046 So, do I understand that...
###5049 even a boy you might pick up in the street would be a pleasing companion?
###5053 I would talk to a street Arab with pleasure if he would talk to me.
###5057 - And take him to your rooms? - Yes.
###5059 And then commit improprieties with him?
###5064 Certainly not.
###5069 <i>You withdraw your libel action against Lord Queensberry.</i>
###5072 Well and good.
###5074 But there remains the question of the evidence...
###5078 Lord Queensberry's evidence against you.
###5081 My information is that the Crown wishes to pursue the matter.
###5087 In which case, an arrest and a charge of gross indecency...
###5092 are certain to follow.
###5094 The maximum sentence is two years hard labor.
###5098 Nine months hard labor is reckoned to be more...
###5102 than a man of our background...
###5104 can survive.
###5109 The children, the boys...
###5111 - I must go and see them. - You have no time for that.
###5114 But my wife... I have to say good-bye to my wife.
###5119 Unless you positively wish to subject her...
###5121 to the further humiliation of seeing you arrested...
###5124 and taken away in front of the gutter press...
###5127 <i>Mr. Wilde, you must go.</i>
###5136 Oscar, you must take that train.
###5140 Practically everyone you know will be on it.
###5143 At least 600 single gentlemen, all in abject terror of arrest.
###5152 Where your life leads you, you must go.
###5157 <i>I defy society.</i>
###5159 Tell him to go.
###5163 He must save himself.
###5167 Tell him to go abroad.
###5169 I've been telling him all day.
###5173 He won't budge.
###5182 People have never understood the courage he needed to be himself.
###5186 You must go abroad too.
###5188 We must all go abroad at once.
###5194 Oscar says, will you tell the boys good-bye.
###5199 I need to go through his papers.
###5205 You know, I was always too silent.
###5208 If I'd known...
###5216 If I'd only spoken up.
###5218 It wouldn't have made any difference.
###5222 Perhaps not...
###5225 but at least I wouldn't blame myself now.
###5251 <i>You're an Irish gentleman. Of course, you must stay.</i>
###5255 Your father fought when he was libeled.
###5257 <i>- I was in the courts myself. I fought... - Yes, I know, Madre.</i>
###5260 You will fight these English philistines, and you'll win.
###5264 And even if you lose... if you go to prison...
###5269 you'll always be my son.
###5272 Of course, it's too late to change that now.
###5276 If you go, Oscar...
###5278 I'll never speak to you again.
###5280 No one will ever speak to me again, whatever I do.
###5285 <i>Of course I'm your son, Madre...</i>
###5288 which is why, even if I lose...
###5292 the English will never forget me.
###5297 My darling.
###5328 Get out of my way. Get out! Out!
###5332 Take me away at once!
###5342 Lady Wilde. Lady Wilde!
###5344 Have you anything to say about your son's disgrace, Lady Wilde?
###5347 <i>Have you anything to say?</i>
###5357 Come in.
###5365 Mr. Wilde, I believe.
###5368 Yes, yes.
###5369 We have a warrant here for your arrest...
###5372 on a charge of committing indecent acts.
###5383 <i>I recommend Switzerland as soon as possible.</i>
###5385 You will have to change your name, of course.
###5390 I can't.
###5392 My dear Constance, the name of Wilde will be...
###5394 a word of execration for the next thousand years.
###5396 You can't possibly let your boys grow up with people knowing who they are.
###5400 Think of their lives at school.
###5402 Thank you for your advice.
###5406 I'm sorry our friendship has to end like this.
###5408 - Oh, you will always be my friend. - I am still Oscar's wife.
###5412 That must cease forthwith. Forthwith. Do you understand?
###5417 Anybody who has anything to do with Oscar from now on...
###5420 will never be received in society again...
###5423 ever.
###5429 Oh, God, Ada. What is going to happen to him?
###5442 That's Oscar Wilde's boy.
###5444 Oscar, you must let me in the witness box.
###5447 If the jury can only hear what I have to say...
###5449 Bosie, darling boy.
###5451 As soon as they see you in all your golden youth...
###5455 and me in all my corruption...
###5457 You didn't corrupt me. I corrupted you, if anything.
###5460 That's not how it will seem.
###5462 But I must have my say. It's outrageous.
###5466 Everyone else has said everything, anything that came into his head.
###5469 But I'm the person all this is about.
###5471 It's me my father wants to get at, not you.
###5474 It's outrageous that I can't have my say.
###5477 It won't help, Bosie. It may actually make things worse.
###5481 But my father will win. I can't endure my father winning.
###5487 You must go away, dear boy.
###5490 I couldn't bear for them to arrest you.
###5496 I can't bear what they're saying about you in court.
###5502 Jesus Christ.
###5506 Good-bye, Bosie, dear boy.
###5508 Don't let anyone, anything, ever change your feeling for me...
###5511 change your love.
###5513 - See you next time. - Time's up, my lord.
###5516 Oscar, never. They never will. I won't let them.
###5531 <i>You've been a great deal in the company of Lord Alfred Douglas?</i>
###5534 Oh, yes.
###5537 - Did he read his poems to you? - Yes.
###5540 So, you can perhaps understand that...
###5543 some of his verses...
###5546 would not be acceptable to a reader with an ordinary balance to mind?
###5552 I'm not prepared to say.
###5554 It's a question of taste and temperament...
###5557 and individuality.
###5560 I should say that one man's poetry is another man's poison.
###5563 Yes, I daresay.
###5565 But in this poem by Lord Alfred Douglas...
###5568 "Two Loves"...
###5570 there is one love, true love...
###5572 which... and I quote...
###5576 "fills the hearts of boy and girl with mutual flame."
###5580 And, there is another:
###5584 "I am the love that dare not speak its name."
###5591 Was that poem explained to you?
###5594 - I think it's clear. - There's no doubt as to what it means?
###5598 Most certainly not.
###5599 So, is it not clear that the love described...
###5602 relates to natural and unnatural love?
###5610 Then what is the love that dare not speak its name?
###5627 The love that dare not speak its name...
###5631 in this century...
###5634 is such a great affection...
###5636 of an elder for a younger man...
###5640 as there was between David and Jonathan...
###5643 such as Plato made the very basis of his philosophy...
###5648 and such as you may find in the sonnets of Michelangelo...
###5651 and Shakespeare.
###5655 It is, in this century, misunderstood...
###5660 so much misunderstood that it may be described as...
###5663 the love that dare not speak its name.
###5666 And, on account of it, I am placed where I am now.
###5672 It is beautiful. It is fine.
###5676 It is the noblest form of affection.
###5680 There's nothing unnatural about it.
###5684 It is intellectual...
###5687 and it repeatedly exists between an elder and a younger man...
###5691 when the elder has intellect...
###5695 and the younger man...
###5697 has all the joy, hope and glamour of life before him.
###5704 That it should be so, the world does not understand.
###5709 The world mocks at it...
###5711 and sometimes puts one in the pillory for it.
###5734 The crime of which you have been convicted...
###5737 is so bad...
###5739 that I shall pass the severest sentence...
###5743 that the law will allow.
###5746 In my judgment, it is totally inadequate for such a case as this.
###5752 It is the worst case I have ever tried!
###5755 The sentence of the court...
###5758 is that you will be imprisoned...
###5760 <i>and held to hard labor...</i>
###5764 <i>- Stand aside, please. - for two years.</i>
###5767 - Shame. - Pervert.
###5774 Pervert!
###5782 Shame on you!
###5805 Disgusting!
###5832 <i>A slim thing, gold-haired like an angel...</i>
###5835 <i>stands always at my side.</i>
###5838 <i>He moves in the gloom like a white flower.</i>
###5842 <i>I thought but to defend him from his father. I thought of nothing else.</i>
###5863 <i>Now my life seems to have gone from me.</i>
###5865 <i>I'm caught in a terrible net.</i>
###5868 <i>But so long as I think he is thinking of me...</i>
###5871 <i>my sweet rose, my delicate flower, my lily of lilies...</i>
###5875 <i>it is in prison that I shall test the power of love.</i>
###5879 <i>I shall see if I can't make the bitter waters sweet...</i>
###5883 <i>by the intensity of the love I bear you.</i>
###5899 <i>He asked me not to change. Those were his last words to me...</i>
###5903 "Don't change."
###5905 Well, things are going to have to change when he comes out.
###5910 He'll have no money at all.
###5912 - So you're blaming me, too, are you? - I'm not blaming anyone.
###5915 Bosie, you're not the only person on this earth Oscar cares about.
###5920 You've always hated me, Robbie...
###5923 because Oscar loved and still loves me when you were just one of his boys.
###5936 I'm suffering just as much as he is, you know.
###5941 My life's ruined too.
###5943 I'm much younger than he is. I've hardly had any life, and it's ruined already.
###5948 When Oscar gets out, we'll live together properly.
###5951 We'll take a villa somewhere near here... Posilipo...
###5955 - or Ischia. - Or Capri.
###5960 I'll take care of him.
###5963 I'll give him everything he wants.
###5966 I love him, Robbie.
###5971 Oscar's mine, and I'm going to have him.
###5990 <i>"Years went over, and the giant grew very old and very feeble.</i>
###5995 <i>He couldn't play about anymore, so he sat in a huge armchair...</i>
###5999 <i>and watched the children at their games and admired his garden.</i>
###6007 <i>'I have many beautiful flowers, ' he said.</i>
###6010 <i>'But the children are the most beautiful flowers of all. "'</i>
###6052 I'm afraid Cyril has got some idea why you're here.
###6056 I'm sending him to school in Germany.
###6062 I can't manage them on my own.
###6068 Your back isn't better then?
###6071 No, not really.
###6074 I may have to have an operation.
###6079 What I've done to you and the boys...
###6082 I can't...
###6084 I shall never forgive myself.
###6090 If we could choose our natures...
###6095 If we could only choose.
###6097 But it's no use.
###6102 Whatever our natures are, we must fulfill them...
###6107 or our lives... my life...
###6109 would have been filled with dishonesty.
###6115 Even more dishonesty than there actually was.
###6124 I've always loved you, Constance.
###6128 You must believe me.
###6132 I don't see how you can have done...
###6134 not truly.
###6137 Not if all the time...
###6139 I didn't know.
###6144 "Know thyself," I used to say.
###6148 I didn't know myself.
###6153 I didn't know.
###6158 I suppose you want a divorce.
###6163 You have every reason.
###6168 I've been thinking, when you do come out...
###6171 when they let you out... you can go to Switzerland or Italy...
###6174 write another play, get yourself back.
###6178 You can.
###6181 You're so clever. You can.
###6194 I don't want a divorce.
###6201 Will you ever let me see the children again?
###6205 Of course.
###6214 But there must be one condition:
###6220 Oscar, you must never see Bosie again.
###6224 If I saw Bosie now, I'd kill him.
###6232 The children love you, Oscar.
###6243 They'll always love you.
###6255 Did anyone tell you?
###6258 <i>They've been performing Salome in Paris.</i>
###6269 <i>"The giant hastened across the grass and came near to the child.</i>
###6273 <i>And when he came quite close, his face grew red with anger.</i>
###6276 <i>And he said, 'Who hath dared to wound thee? '</i>
###6280 <i>For on the palms of the child's hands were the prints of two nails.</i>
###6284 <i>And the prints of two nails were on his little feet.</i>
###6303 <i>'Who hath dared to wound thee? ' Cried the giant.</i>
###6307 <i>'Tell me, that I may take my big sword and slay him. '</i>
###6311 <i>'Nay, 'answered the child.</i>
###6313 <i>'For these are the wounds of love. "'</i>
###6324 Bosie thinks I'm jealous.
###6327 I think it will come as a shock to Bosie to realize...
###6329 that even he is relatively unimportant in the scheme of things.
###6332 But, no doubt, Bosie will be remembered as long as Oscar...
###6336 unfortunately.
###6343 I sometimes wonder...
###6348 if I hadn't...
###6354 pushed him into...
###6356 Don't.
###6359 Oscar was very lucky to meet you, Robbie.
###6362 Think who else it might have been.
###6365 Oh, I'll have that one. Thank you.
###6367 - Must you go abroad again at once? - I shouldn't be here now.
###6374 But has he got anywhere to go when he's released?
###6377 It'll have to be in France.
###6379 I'm going to see what I can arrange.
###6382 But here...
###6384 when he leaves prison...
###6392 - Good-bye, Mr. Harris. - Good-bye, sir.
###6395 Good-bye, Mr. Snow. Thank you.
###6403 My dear Sphinx.
###6407 How marvelous of you to know what hat to wear at 7:00 in the morning...
###6410 to meet a friend who's been away.
###6413 - No, I'll keep this. - What is it.
###6416 It's a letter to Bosie telling him...
###6419 how I love him but can never see him again.
###6421 I'm going to ask Robbie to have it copied out before I send it.
###6424 I rather fear Bosie might throw it on the fire.
###6428 <i>I call it De Profundis. It comes from the very depths.</i>
###6466 <i>"I know not whether laws be right...</i>
###6469 <i>or whether laws be wrong.</i>
###6472 <i>All that we know who lie in jail...</i>
###6474 <i>is that the wall is strong...</i>
###6476 <i>and that each day is like a year...</i>
###6479 <i>a year whose days are long.</i>
###6486 <i>Yet each man kills the thing he loves.</i>
###6490 <i>By each, let this be heard.</i>
###6493 <i>Some do it with a bitter look...</i>
###6495 <i>some with a flattering word.</i>
###6498 <i>The coward does it with a kiss...</i>
###6500 <i>the brave man with a sword.</i>
###6506 <i>Some kill their love when they are young...</i>
###6508 <i>and some when they are old.</i>
###6511 <i>Some strangle with the hands of lust...</i>
###6514 <i>some with the hands of gold.</i>
###6517 <i>The kindest use a knife...</i>
###6520 <i>because the dead so soon grow cold. "</i>
###6532 I'm sure we can find an hotel near here.
###6537 Somewhere where you can work.
###6548 - I've decided to see him again, Robbie. - Yes.
###6552 - I thought you might. - I've nothing left.
###6557 I've lost my wife.
###6559 I've lost my children.
###6563 They won't allow me to see them now.
###6567 No one will ever read my plays or books again.
###6569 Yes, they will.
###6571 Bosie loves me more than he loves anyone else...
###6576 as much as he can love...
###6578 and allow himself to be loved.
###6585 I think we need some more wine.
###6590 I find that alcohol...
###6594 taken in sufficient quantities...
###6600 Can bring about all the effects of drunkenness.
###6647 <i>"Life cheats us with shadows.</i>
###6648 <i>We ask it for pleasure. It gives it to us...</i>
###6652 <i>with bitterness and disappointment in its train.</i>
###6655 <i>And we find ourselves looking with dull heart of stone...</i>
###6659 <i>at the tress of gold-flecked hair...</i>
###6661 <i>that we had once so wildly worshipped...</i>
###6664 <i>and so madly kissed. "</i>
###6702 <i>In this world, there are only two tragedies.</i>
###6706 <i>One is not getting what one wants.</i>
###6708 <i>The other is getting it.</i>
