###17 <i>Oh, Eileen</i>
###20 <i>Said, come on, Eileen</i>
###22 <i>I need to-loo-rye-ay</i>
###25 <i>Come on, I need to-loo-rye-ay</i>
###28 <i>Now I must say, more than ever</i>
###31 <i>Things round here have changed, I said</i>
###34 <i>Too-ra, loo-ra, too-ra, loo-rye-ay</i>
###53 <i>,,verge on dirty</i>
###55 <i>Ah, come on, Eileen</i>
###72 <i>What are you doing playing army on Sunday morning ? You're missing Grange Hill,</i>
###75 The TA is no game, Tim.
###77 It isn't the TA, Mike, it's the Rough Ramblers.
###80 You're a civilian, you don't understand. You're thinking "It's Sunday, I'd rather be in bed."
###84 <i>And you're thinking "It's Sunday, I'd rather be in Apocalypse Now, "</i>
###88 That's easy for you to say. What are you doing later on ?
###90 - It's classified. - Why don't you come round ? I'm bored.
###93 I can't - combat canoeing.
###95 I'm learning to Eskimo roll with a two-stone rucksack on my back, holding a loaded rifle.
###99 They don't have rifles in the Rough Ramblers, Mike.
###102 - Hand grenades ? - No.
###103 - Anthrax ? - Mike !
###105 Listen, Tim, gotta go. Looks like we're moving out. Roger Bravo Tango Alpha.
###111 Come on, Mike.
###117 Yay ! Danny Kendall's about to die.
###124 You're right, that is better than when Jeremy went into the swimming pool
###127 to retrieve Fay's necklace and suffered a brain embolism.
###131 Bronson's got to pay.
###133 Bronson's got to pay !
###136 <i>Tim, Bronson's got to pay, He's got a toupee,</i>
###141 Can I bring the bike in ? Your landlady's got the look of a bike thief about her.
###145 What, ageing female divorcee ? What's she gonna do, sell it to buy Jacob's Creek ?
###148 Don't get sarky, that bike's my living. Not like you pretending to be a struggling cartoonist,
###153 poncing off the state while decent taxpayers like me fund your drink problem.
###156 I wouldn't mind so much, but you seem to be having such a shit time.
###158 Anyway, I was just coming back from a club, right, passed your gaff and I remembered -
###162 you owe me 20 quid.
###164 Daisy, this is Tyres, he bikes my drawings round for me.
###167 Tyres ! Yeah, Tim told me he had more than one friend,
###170 <i>I didn't believe him, but here you are - it's The Village Of The Damned !</i>
###175 - Are youse two... ? - What, hand ? I don't...
###179 Are youse two an item ?
###181 No ! No.That's... No. Well...
###184 No, Daisy's not like that. That's funny, that's actually funny.
###187 - No, we're just mates, aren't we ? Chums. - Get off me !
###191 Oh, I see, youse are er... "friends".
###195 - Yeah. - Yeah.
###199 Did you want a cup of tea, Tyres ?
###200 I couldn't eat a thing, my stomach's like a walnut.
###202 - Can't you even have tea ? - No, no solids.
###204 - Something orange ? - Er, water ?
###207 Water ? OK.
###236 Hello ? What, already ?
###240 All right. I'll see you later.
###243 - Who was that ? - It was Mike.
###245 He just nearly drowned doing an Eskimo roll. He put too many pebbles in his rucksack.
###249 <i>Last time I seen Mike he was on Crimewatch,</i>
###251 No, that was a case of mistaken identity. Police had his house surrounded last week.
###255 - No, this was about two months ago. - Oh, yeah, that was him.
###259 What did you do last night ?
###261 Last night ? Last night was A1, tip-top, clubbing jam fair.
###265 It was a sandwich of fun on ecstasy bread, wrapped up in a bag like disco fudge.
###269 <i>Doesn't get much better than that. I just wish I could control these fucking mood swings !</i>
###274 <i>So what did youse two friends do last night ?</i>
###279 Oh, we just stayed in, didn't we ? Had a laugh, played Scrabble.
###283 (Roberto Picardo: lena Sequence)
###287 Six. Seven. Six.
###291 Live, or live.
###295 <i>Shazam. It is a word. It is a word. I've got a pile of comics this big.</i>
###299 - Captain Marvel says it. - It's a nonsense invented word.
###302 You're only doing that so you can use Z. Take it off, it's not a word.
###308 Pro V. Pantene Pro V.
###310 You can't have Pantene Pro V !
###312 It's the ingredient in the shampoo that makes the hair silky and smooth !
###317 It's a word they made up to make shampoo sound important !
###319 You're so naive. I cannot believe...
###322 It probably isn't a word !
###326 Fuck !
###328 - What ? - The last four letters you threw spelt "fuck".
###331 Oh. What do you think that means ?
###334 I see. So you skipped the sex part and went straight to the Scrabble.
###337 I can't get my head round this platonic inter-gender relationship malarkey.
###341 It just doesn't seem right.
###342 Don't get me wrong, I don't mind having a chinwag with a honey,
###345 but I just like to do it after waggling her chin, you know what I mean ?
###348 - Yeah. - You like to waggle your willie on her chin ?
###351 Don't come your post-feminist, art-school bollocks with me, sunflower,
###355 if that's your real frigging name, all right ?
###356 - I work for a living. What do you do ? - I write, actually.
###360 Oh, do you ? In other words, you're on the dole.
###362 So anyway, are youse two friends coming out with me tonight or what ?
###365 - No money. - I'll lend you the money.
###368 - I already owe you 20 quid. - Do you ?
###371 No.
###373 - Oh, look, there's Madonna. - Where ?
###375 - So we'll see you later, then, yeah ? - Cool, right.
###378 OK, I'm going off for a shower, a shit and a shave. I'll be back for youse about eleven.
###382 Pack your party bags, people, cos tonight is gonna be a large one, all right ?
###384 Be lucky ! Oi-oi !
###389 - What was all that about Madonna ? - Tyres has got a really short attention span.
###393 I remember once... Oh, look, wrestling.
###399 - Get the stick, get the stick ! - Come on.
###402 - Aargh ! - Sorry, mate.
###404 - Bastard ! - Sorry. God.
###411 I haven't been to a club in ages. I think we should ask Brian to come.
###415 I don't really see Brian throwing shapes in the church of dance, do you ?
###419 Well, he might if we ask Twist to come.
###422 - Brian and Twist ? - Yeah ! Get with the programme !
###425 - Although Tyres'll think we're double-dating. - Urgh.
###428 He was funny, wasn't he ?
###431 What did you mean when you said "Daisy's not like that" ?
###433 - I never said that. - You did.
###435 He said "Are you two... ?" and you said "No, Daisy's not like that."
###438 - I just wondered what you meant. - I just meant... I meant you're not like that.
###441 I don't see you in that way.
###444 - What am I ? Chopped liver ? - I wish !
###449 You're too hung up on your ex-girlfriend to even notice the existence of another woman.
###454 Who said that ? !
###456 No, I'm serious. I'm serious, I think you've got a big problem.
###460 Shut up ! You don't know anything about my problems !
###463 Yes, I do. Half a bottle of Galliano and that's all you talk about.
###467 - Bloody Galliano. - No, it's an obsession, Tim, it's unhealthy.
###470 I heard you call her name out in your sleep the other night.
###472 How did you know I was asleep ?
###473 Why would you call her name out if you were awake ?
###476 All I'm saying is I think you've got a V big problem with your ex-G-friend.
###481 Just back off, will you ? What do you care about what I do, anyway ?
###484 All right ! I was just making an observation.
###487 Yeah, well, don't, all right ? You don't know what you're talking about.
###493 - Sorry ! - It's all right.
###502 You gonna ask Brian if he wants to come out ?
###504 Yes !
###506 - Are you gonna sulk all day ? - No !
###520 Can't come out.
###522 We're going to a club later. Do you want to come ?
###524 - I don't go to clubs. - What do you mean, you don't go to clubs ?
###529 I'm working, Tim. Working. Do you understand ?
###534 No, sorry. Got me there.
###535 Trying to... avoid...
###539 clich–πs
###542 by not actually placing my brush on the canvas.
###546 Wow. Right.
###548 - I'm using my penis. - Finally !
###552 Do you want to see ?
###554 No, I'm just about to have my tea. Why don't you come out ? It'll be good for you.
###558 No, it won't.
###561 Twist'll be there.
###564 Will she ?
###571 Can't.
###575 Huge.
###579 - It's a no. - Shh !
###581 Money, money, that's all you care about.
###583 - What do you know about what I care about ? - More than you think, young lady !
###587 Leave me alone !
###589 <i>Oh, I feel for Amber,</i>
###598 <i>I feel for Amber,</i>
###601 <i>Why you gotta play that song so loud ?</i>
###603 <i>Because we want to, because we want to</i>
###610 That'll be Marsha.
###612 No !
###615 - Hi, Marsha. - Hello.
###618 Sorry about the noise. Periods, you know.
###621 - Her dad left. - I thought he left when she was two.
###625 Yeah, yeah. She is milking it slightly.
###630 - So do you want a tea ? - No, no, I won't intrude.
###634 Yeah, all right, then, I'll have a small one.
###636 One small tea.
###641 It's difficult, isn't it ? Me and my mum used to row all the time.
###646 I'll worry about you if you stay out later than ten.
###650 - Try to think about my feelings. - Oh, all right.
###657 - Bye, Mum. Love you. - Bye, dumpling. Love you too.
###661 Oh, yeah ! She used to go ballistic.
###665 She'd say "You're not going out" and I'd say "Yes, I am."
###670 It was a nightmare. She was just so unreasonable.
###673 - For God's sake, she was worried about you. - No, she wasn't.
###677 She was scared to face a life without me so she tried to stop me from growing.
###681 That is so self-obsessed, as if everything revolved around you.
###684 She probably looked forward to you going but wanted to show she cared about you.
###689 If she'd wanted to do that, she could have bought me that pony.
###692 That's what it boils down to with you - money, money, money. It's all you care about.
###695 - What do you know about what I care about ? - More than you think, young lady.
###699 Oh, leave me alone !
###709 You got any biscuits ?
###728 How is she ?
###729 The fibreglass on the outer casing was severely damaged in the incident.
###734 - What happened ? - Showing off, Tim.
###736 I had fifteen rocks in my rucksack instead of the regulation five.
###740 I knew something was wrong when I got her in the water. She was sitting so low.
###743 So low.
###745 But I didn't stop, Tim. Fifteen rocks in my rucksack and everyone knew it.
###749 So what happened when you rolled ?
###751 I lost control of the vessel two feet from the shore.
###753 As I struggled to right her, I banged into the jetty,
###756 damaging the canoe's carcass.
###758 The ramble leader had to dive in and rescue me from beneath the canoe.
###763 So it wasn't so much an Eskimo roll,
###765 <i>it was more a case of rolling right Inuit !</i>
###771 Inuit's another word for Eskimo.
###773 I've been thrown out, Tim. The Rough Ramblers don't want me any more.
###779 Come on, come on. Come on.
###781 I've gotta face it, Tim. I'm not the big man, not the leader.
###784 No-one's ever gonna look up to me. I feel like a failure.
###788 You're not a failure, Mike, you're not.
###790 You're too good for them. They're not ready for you.
###793 You're a renegade, you're a soldier of fortune.
###796 - Yeah, like the A-Team. - Yeah, you're like Mr T but white and hairy.
###800 - I am, aren't I ? - I feel sorry for anybody who says you're not.
###803 <i>- I pity the fool. - I pity the fool.</i>
###804 - "I ain't going on no plane, sucker." - Stop that.
###807 - I'll never be in the real army, though, will I ? - No.
###809 - Cos of what happened.
###818 I know, Mike, and I'm sorry, but this was a long time ago.
###822 I haven't let you down since, have I ?
###824 No.
###827 - And I never will. - I know.
###830 Come 'ere, you big twat.
###834 - Ahem ! Excuse me. - Just a second.
###841 OK.
###846 Mike !
###850 - Cheap Dutch lager for the lady ? - No, thanks.
###853 - Oh, thanks( !) - I'm on a special diet. I have to eat like a bird.
###857 What, like this ?
###866 - Where's Brian ? - Yeah, Tim, where's Brian ?
###869 - Up his own arse. - You don't like him ?
###872 I do like him, I'm just not sure why.
###874 How are you, Mike ?
###878 - Yep. - That's a well-fitted body warmer, Mike.
###881 It's a life jacket.
###883 - Have you been yachting ? - I've been all-terrain rambling.
###885 Kind of off-road rambling. Comes in all forms of outdoor pursuits -
###890 walking, canoeing, killing.
###893 - Killing ? - No, no. No killing.
###897 - Maybe you should take the jacket off now. - He will when he's ready.
###904 - Coming out tonight, Mike ? - I don't know. I don't really go out much.
###907 - I haven't got anything to wear. - Come on, Mike. Come on ! Let's all go out.
###912 Let's get dressed up and go out. We'll be like a gang. Like a group.
###917 Like an army. Yeah.
###922 - Try this. - Hey, is this mine ?
###925 - That's mine ! - I let you borrow my clothes.
###927 Why would I want to borrow your clothes ?
###935 Oh, you look fantastic !
###939 - Too tight ? - No !
###941 It does look really good. Maybe you could tie something round your waist...
###944 if you feel a bit self-conscious.
###946 - The style's a bit feminine, isn't it ? - No !
###949 Of course it's too feminine, it's a girl's top ! Get away from him.
###953 Mike, don't let them dress you up like a giant cock.
###957 I had to dress up as an elderly Israeli woman once.
###959 <i>- Did you ? - I didn't have to.</i>
###961 We should talk.
###974 Is this too much ?
###976 - Yes. - No !
###980 Oh, hi, Bri.
###982 - Can I use your video while you're out ? - What are you gonna do ?
###986 Stick it to canvas as part of a piece depicting a society populated by cathode junkies
###990 selling their imagination for quick-fix media hits from the Blockbuster syringe ?
###995 <i>No, I want to record Ready Steady Cook,</i>
###1000 OK.
###1002 - You're sure you don't want to come out ? - No, I don't go to clubs.
###1005 - Oh, why ? - Erm...
###1013 - Just don't.
###1015 Get that, will you, Mike ?
###1019 So, er... packed the party bag ?
###1022 Yes, two fresh jumpers, two fresh T-shirts, two woolly hats, all right ?
###1027 You saved any small countries from tyranny recently ?
###1030 - No. - I like a soldier that minds his own business.
###1033 Wahey ! Oh, you lucky people !
###1036 - Who's this ? - It's Brian. He's not coming.
###1039 - Why are you not coming ? - Well... Yeah, why aren't you coming ?
###1042 Why aren't you coming, Brian ? It won't be the same without you. Please !
###1047 I don't go clubbing !
###1049 Hello, everyone.
###1052 - Oh, hi, Marsha. - Hi, Marsha.
###1054 You all going out ?
###1056 Yeah, except Brian.
###1058 Looks like it's just you and me, then, Brian.
###1071 - I'm gonna put my coat in the cloakroom. - Yeah, take mine, will you, Daisy ?
###1074 - Take mine, too. - There's no point us both queuing, is there ?
###1088 Thanks very much, little lady.
###1113 - Who wrote the music ? - What ?
###1116 - Who wrote the music ? - I'm sorry, I can't hear you.
###1120 What ?
###1239 I've got to dance !
###1242 Let's weave !
###1276 Hey, listen, I'm sorry about earlier on, snapping at you.
###1279 I was so out of order. I'm really sorry.
###1281 No !
###1283 No, it's fine. It was fine. It's good.
###1286 - Is it ? - Yeah, we're on another level.
###1287 Yeah, we are, cos we can snap at each other and it doesn't matter
###1291 and it's not a problem, it's not an issue, you know what I mean ?
###1293 It's beneath us, yeah.
###1296 Yeah, cos I like you, I do. I just like living with you, it's fun.
###1299 You know, you're so talented, you're gonna do so well.
###1303 <i>You are. You are. No, you are.</i>
###1306 <i>- You're so good. - No.</i>
###1308 <i>- You're such a good artist. - Am I ?</i>
###1310 - You are ! You're so good. - I am.
###1313 You're gonna be fine, we're both gonna be fine, gonna do well.
###1316 We're gonna do so well and when we do, we'll get a big house in Hampstead
###1319 and we'll get a room in the house and have our own club.
###1322 Have a club and we'll get all our friends in.
###1325 We'll be like the King and Queen of Clubland, you and me.
###1328 Yeah, you and me.
###1332 Yaaay ! Ah-ha-ha !
###1335 Terribly sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.
###1337 <i>I was just wondering if you two friends would like to come and join the collective.</i>
###1350 - I'm sorry I left you in the queue. - I had a great time. Where's Mike ?
###1355 - Where's Mike ? - Where's Mike ?
###1357 He's over there.
