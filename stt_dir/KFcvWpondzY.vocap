###1 CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: There is a storm out there that`s potentially effecting tens of
###4 millions of people, including a lot of folks in our audience. We`re going in depth on Hurricane
###8 Sandy today, on CNN STUDENT NEWS.
###18 23 states, nearly half the country. On Monday afternoon, that`s how many were under some
###36 kind of warning or advisory for wind related to Hurricane Sandy. This is the view of Sandy
###42 from the international space station. It`s huge. All that white stuff, that`s Sandy`s
###47 wind field. If that were a country, it would be the 20th biggest country in the world.
###52 But you really start to understand its power and intensity when you are on the ground.
###56 The rain is torrential, and the wind - yesterday it was consistently blowing at about 90 miles
###62 per hour. Then, there is something called the storm surge. That`s the combination of
###66 a storm and high tide. You see those waves off the coast of Massachusetts? Storms like
###72 this drive those waves higher, some areas were expecting a storm surge 11 feet above
###78 normal high tide. That could lead to severe flooding.
###82 Some officials say that the damage from Hurricane Sandy could be unprecedented. One government
###86 model says we could be looking at more than $7 billion in damages, and that`s just from
###91 the wind. When it comes to storms that make landfall in the northeastern U.S., this is
###97 the one all the others get compared to. The Long Island Hurricane of 1938. One of the
###102 things that experts look at when they are measuring hurricanes is the low pressure reading.
###107 Usually, the lower the pressure, the stronger the storm. The 1938 hurricane had a low pressure
###113 reading of 946 millibars. Sandy`s low pressure reading -- 943. I asked CNN`s Chad Myers about
###121 the comparison between these two storms.
###123 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
###124 CHAD MYERS, AMS METEOROLOGIST: The problem with this storm call is that people took it
###128 as a category one. It had the pressure of a category two or three, the wind field of
###135 a category one hurricane, but yet the surge of a category two or three. When it got north
###140 of Cape Hatteras, and kept getting stronger, the pressure of this storm was deeper, it
###146 was a stronger storm than the 1938 storm that just rolled right over Long Island. This was
###152 always a dangerous storm, we knew it in the pressure. Sometimes you just can`t tell people,
###157 hey, it`s a cat one, take cover, because they say ah, it`s just a cat one, we don`t care.
###161 This was much, much more than a category one hurricane.
###164 (END VIDEOTAPE)
###165 AZUZ: All right, thanks, Chad. There is something else going on with Hurricane Sandy that could
###168 make its impact even worse. It`s the possibility that this could turn into a super storm. Now,
###174 let me show you what we mean by that. There is Sandy spinning off the East Coast, and
###178 that high pressure system is keeping it from moving out into the Atlantic. Then there is
###182 this cold front moving in from the west. What happens is that when the cold air and the
###187 warm air meet up and make Sandy more powerful, and you can see there, it keeps the storm
###192 in that same area, just sitting right over that part of the country. When it`s all said
###197 and done, Sandy could end up affecting up to 60 million people. Some states have mandatory
###202 evacuations, thousands of people spent the night at shelters like this one. Hundreds
###207 of thousands of people lost power, and school was canceled for millions of students. We
###212 heard from some of you on Facebook and Twitter about that.
###215 Hurricane Sandy is even having an impact on the race for the White House. President Obama
###220 and Republican presidential nominee Romney, both altered or canceled campaign events yesterday.
###226 Instead of next week`s election, they were focused on the storm and the people in its
###229 path.
###230 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
###230 BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: We anticipate that there are going
###232 to be a lot of trees down, a lot of water and despite the fact that the power companies
###240 are working very closely with the various state officials and local officials to make
###245 sure that they are bringing in as many assets as possible and getting those ready in preparation
###250 for the storm, the fact is that a lot of these emergency crews are not going to be able to
###254 get into position to start restoring power until some of these winds have died down.
###259 MITT ROMNEY, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We faced these kinds of challenges before.
###262 And as we have, it`s interesting to see how Americans come together, and this, this looks
###267 like another time when we need to come together, all across the country, even here in Ohio,
###272 and make sure that we give of our support to the people who need it.
###276 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###277 AZUZ: Campaigning is on halt for the hurricane. The election is still going to happen, it`s
###281 just a week away, and what we are going to do this week is look at where the candidates
###284 stand on some of the issues. Today`s topic is education. During his first term in the
###289 White House, President Obama launched a program called "Race to the Top". It offers money
###293 from the federal government to states for coming up with plans to meet national standards
###298 and improve teacher quality and plans to turn around low performing schools. The president
###303 also supports the development of charter schools.
###306 Governor Romney`s education plan is called "A Chance for Every Child." He also supports
###310 national standards, but he said that education policies should come more from the state and
###315 local level rather than from the federal government. Governor Romney`s plan also focuses on choice.
###321 He said he wants to give some parents the ability to choose where their kids go to school.
###326 Yesterday, we looked at the electoral college, the system that determines who wins the presidency.
###331 We looked at some scenarios for both Governor Romney and President Obama to get enough votes
###335 to win the election. One other possibility came up at the end of that report yesterday.
###340 A tie. Now, Josh Levs looks at what could happen.
###343 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
###344 JOSH LEVS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It could happen, and it would throw the race into confusion
###349 and controversy. What if President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney tie in the electoral
###354 college with 269 votes each? There is an amendment for that. Here is how it works. In January,
###360 the new House of Representatives would choose the president, with each state getting one
###365 vote. Republicans will almost surely have the majority in that vote and choose Romney.
###371 But not Paul Ryan. The vice president gets decided by the Senate. If that`s still in
###376 Democratic control, Biden would almost surely win. So, thanks to the electoral system, we
###382 could have a Romney-Biden White House.
###386 But there is also another possibility. Let`s go back to that electoral college tie. These
###391 are the votes electors are expected to take, based on the votes in their states. But they
###395 don`t all legally have to. Some states don`t have laws to punish faithless electors who
###401 go their own way. So, if there is a tie, expect swayable electors to suddenly become very,
###407 very popular to some, and a source of anger to others.

###412 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Today, "Shoutout" goes out to Mr. Uselding`s social studies classes
###418 at St. Frances Cabrini Catholic School in West Bend, Wisconsin. Which of these U.S.
###423 military branches was established last? Here we go, was it the Army, Navy, Air Force or
###431 Marines? You`ve got three seconds, go!
###440 The Air Force was established as its own military branch in 1947. Before that, it was part of
###446 the U.S. Army. That`s your answer, and that`s your "Shoutout."
###451 AZUZ: OK, I`ve heard of a chain-linked fence, a white-picket fence, even a defense. But
###457 a space fence -- that`s a real thing. The Air Force has been in charge of it for decades,
###462 but the fence needs some repairs, about $3.5 billion worth. The space fence program is
###469 a series of radar signals. What they do is track space junk. Some pieces are as small
###474 as a soft ball, others are as big as a bus. And it`s good to have a heads up if one of
###478 those is heading towards the International Space Station or satellite that carries TV
###482 signals or cell phone service. The Air Force tracks about 20,000 pieces of space junk,
###488 but it`s estimated that there are ten times that much junk floating around out there.
###494 The military wants to restring the space fence, so to speak, before something slips through.
###500 Washington State University head football coach, Mike Leach, hasn`t posted anything
###504 on Twitter in a couple of weeks. And hopefully, his players haven`t either. Because if they
###508 do, and coach Leach finds out about it, he says they`ll be suspended from the team. The
###514 coach banned his players from using the social media service last week. The school`s athletic
###518 director said some players posted inappropriate tweets. He described them as vulgar. Some
###523 Washington State students think this is a good decision, since the players represent
###527 the school; others think the coach shouldn`t be allowed to take away a player`s right to
###532 use Twitter.
###533 What do you think of the coach`s decision to keep players off Twitter? Do you agree
###537 it will help prevent distractions, or do you think it stifles their speech? Cnnstudentnews.com
###542 is the place to tell us.
###544 Before we go, we know a lot of you out there have gangnam style. We also know that the
###548 leader of the United Nations doesn`t. Well, not a lot. Here you see him next to international
###553 pop star Psy. Now, Psy tries to show U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon a little gangnam
###560 style. Ban falls off the horse. He admitted he was a little jealous of Psy. Ban says he`d
###565 have to relinquish being the world`s most famous Korean. Of course, in the U.N. workplace,
###570 Ban`s more focused on ergangnomics (ph). And you can`t really blame the performer, because
###574 he reached for the moon, and with moves like that, the Psy`s the limit. OK, I`m done. We`ll
###578 see you tomorrow, on CNN STUDENT NEWS.
