1
0:0:6,277 --> 0:0:8,728
London Heathrow is the busiest international


2
0:0:8,728 --> 0:0:12,679
Airport in The world.It handles nearly half


3
0:0:12,679 --> 0:0:16,311
a million flights,and could easily feed  


4
0:0:16,311 --> 0:0:18,96
the entire british population through its 


5
0:0:18,96 --> 0:0:27,92
gates every year.For Heathrow to get this big


6
0:0:27,92 --> 0:0:29,911
,it took a series of major technological 


7
0:0:29,911 --> 0:0:35,46
innovations.We have lined up seven


8
0:0:35,46 --> 0:0:39,859
landmark airports,historic giants of aviation.


9
0:0:39,859 --> 0:0:43,647
At the heart of each one lies a technology


10
0:0:43,647 --> 0:0:46,499
that allowed airports to feed ever more people 


11
0:0:46,499 --> 0:0:51,62
through their gates,safely,quickly and comfortably


12
0:0:51,62 --> 0:0:55,591
One by one travelling up the scale we will reveal the


13
0:0:55,591 --> 0:0:58,996
incredible stories behind these airports 


14
0:0:58,996 --> 0:1:0,615
and the inventions that transformed them into 


15
0:1:0,615 --> 0:1:5,444
sprawling city-like structures.Seven ingenious


16
0:1:5,444 --> 0:1:8,477
leaps forward that enabled airports to evolve


17
0:1:8,477 --> 0:1:39,246
 from big to bigger into the worlds biggest


18
0:1:39,246 --> 0:1:42,895
Heathrow Airport,Britain's gateway to the world


19
0:1:42,895 --> 0:1:48,362
and a huge powerhouse for the country's economy


20
0:1:48,362 --> 0:1:55,981
,and now it will get even bigger,T5 an immense new terminal 


21
0:1:55,981 --> 0:2:5,745
that cost over 8 billion dollars to build is about to open.


22
0:2:5,745 --> 0:2:11,116
Lead Architect Mike Davis can't wait "It's going to


23
0:2:11,116 --> 0:2:14,662
be fantastic,it's 19 years of work all going to come into 


24
0:2:14,662 --> 0:2:18,46
frutition when the first plane comes through.  "


25
0:2:18,46 --> 0:2:22,235
T5 has three huge terminal buildings,assembled


26
0:2:22,235 --> 0:2:31,401
from 80,000 tons of steel.The main terminal is a true


27
0:2:31,401 --> 0:2:35,358
skyscraper of a terminal,reaching 40 metres


28
0:2:35,358 --> 0:2:40,895
into the sky."This is a building of immense complexity


29
0:2:40,895 --> 0:2:46,58
we had to satisfy the needs of 43 different groups of people


30
0:2:46,58 --> 0:2:49,597
,to make sure that this building got a tick in the box


31
0:2:49,597 --> 0:2:52,44
from everybody,and you are talking about major systems


32
0:2:52,44 --> 0:2:55,229
like passenger check-in and you got the retail and various


33
0:2:55,229 --> 0:2:58,694
passenger services.We got three big railway stations


34
0:2:58,694 --> 0:3:1,128
under this building,all of that has to be co-ordinated 


35
0:3:1,128 --> 0:3:7,79
together.T5 will process 30 million passengers a year.


36
0:3:7,79 --> 0:3:11,89
It takes Heathrow's capacity to nearly a 100 million


37
0:3:11,89 --> 0:3:25,583
travellers.To understand how Heathrow became this busy,


38
0:3:25,583 --> 0:3:33,944
we need to go back in time,and look at how airports begin.


39
0:3:33,944 --> 0:3:36,446
The first big breakthrough comes with a small


40
0:3:36,446 --> 0:3:42,29
airport just outside London.Before it can get any bigger,


41
0:3:42,29 --> 0:3:49,396
Croydon airport must make the sky above it safer.


42
0:3:49,396 --> 0:3:53,689
In 1920 Croydon is the main airport in London aviation


43
0:3:53,689 --> 0:3:58,845
is young and navigation primitive."Flying was really


44
0:3:58,845 --> 0:4:4,111
the pilot made use of landmarks such as coastlines,


45
0:4:4,111 --> 0:4:11,761
rivers,large towns,roadways.But the Mark I eyeball


46
0:4:11,761 --> 0:4:19,312
can't always be trusted.On the 7th of April 1922 a French


47
0:4:19,312 --> 0:4:23,13
pilot heading out of Paris airport drops below the clouds


48
0:4:23,13 --> 0:4:32,463
to get his bearings.Scanning the ground for landmarks 


49
0:4:32,463 --> 0:4:35,78
he doesn't realise that a cargo plane from Croydon


50
0:4:35,78 --> 0:4:41,562
is approaching on exactly the same heading.The first 


51
0:4:41,562 --> 0:4:44,895
collision in the history of civil aviation kills seven


52
0:4:44,895 --> 0:4:54,462
people.It was an accident waiting to happen."Pilots would


53
0:4:54,462 --> 0:4:58,363
be looking out to see the road they were following,.


54
0:4:58,363 --> 0:5:0,519
they were looking over to the side,the road was here


55
0:5:0,519 --> 0:5:3,644
,the other jet was looking maybe the same side,the road


56
0:5:3,644 --> 0:5:7,995
and they were really over the top of the road.


57
0:5:7,995 --> 0:5:12,145
To stop such disasters from ever happening again,Croydon


58
0:5:12,145 --> 0:5:19,28
invents a clever new technology.Every aircraft heading


59
0:5:19,28 --> 0:5:26,5
towards the airport sends out a radio burst.


60
0:5:26,5 --> 0:5:29,678
A radio receiver at Croydon then measures the angle of this 


61
0:5:29,678 --> 0:5:35,201
signal which reveals where the plane is coming from.


62
0:5:35,201 --> 0:5:38,94
" I'm getting a call which is telling me that Croydon


63
0:5:38,94 --> 0:5:43,71
 has a bearing of 140,So I'm taking out the mouse 


64
0:5:43,71 --> 0:5:51,845
and placing it on a bearing of 140 " .But a plane's bearing isn't 


65
0:5:51,845 --> 0:5:56,228
enough to pinpoint it's precise position,so Croydon 


66
0:5:56,228 --> 0:6:0,413
installs two more radio stations and their recievers


67
0:6:0,413 --> 0:6:4,845
lock on as well." Huramenel now calling they have a


68
0:6:4,845 --> 0:6:17,821
bearing of 195,and just here Lim-Lim have a bearing of 230


69
0:6:17,821 --> 0:6:24,355
I can see now that the strings cross at Haistings, the pilot


70
0:6:24,355 --> 0:6:29,97
is over Haistings." Once Croydon knows the plane's


71
0:6:29,97 --> 0:6:35,212
coordinates they can safely guide it to the airport.


72
0:6:35,212 --> 0:6:46,723
This is the birth of Air Traffic Control.In 1921 Croydon


73
0:6:46,723 --> 0:6:51,446
Airport had about 60 flights per week,today Heathrow


74
0:6:51,446 --> 0:6:56,378
pushes in to upto a 100 flights per hour.Air Traffic Control


75
0:6:56,378 --> 0:6:59,83
guides planes out of the sky and hands them over to


76
0:6:59,83 --> 0:7:4,836
 the Ground Traffic Controllers,they need to be able to see


77
0:7:4,836 --> 0:7:7,625
every single tail fin on the tarmac with their own


78
0:7:7,625 --> 0:7:13,625
eyes.This is where the construction of Terminal 5 creates a 


79
0:7:13,625 --> 0:7:22,38
problem.The T5 buildings are so tall  that controllers


80
0:7:22,38 --> 0:7:26,939
can't see the planes at the far end.They need a new 


81
0:7:26,939 --> 0:7:30,477
taller control tower right in the middle of the airport,


82
0:7:30,477 --> 0:7:35,114
one of the busiest crossroads at Heathrow,turning  it into a


83
0:7:35,114 --> 0:7:46,801
construction site would cause chaos for the aircraft. 


84
0:7:46,801 --> 0:7:49,711
The only option is to build the new control tower


85
0:7:49,711 --> 0:7:52,714
on the edge of the airport and move it into position


86
0:7:52,714 --> 0:8:2,164
in one piece.But the tower weighs nearly a 1000 tons


87
0:8:2,164 --> 0:8:5,7
moving it onto the airport takes months of careful planning


88
0:8:5,7 --> 0:8:9,613
there is no margin for error." It was a great challenge


89
0:8:9,613 --> 0:8:11,561
to do it because we had to do it without stopping airline


90
0:8:11,561 --> 0:8:18,133
operations,not a single aircraft should be rescheduled.


91
0:8:18,133 --> 0:8:20,846
We decided one great friday evening to wheel it across


92
0:8:20,846 --> 0:8:23,347
the airport and we took the fence down and rolled it out


93
0:8:23,347 --> 0:8:31,264
on to the apron . " Just after Heathrow shuts down,the tower


94
0:8:31,264 --> 0:8:35,446
begins it 2km journey across the airport,balanced on


95
0:8:35,446 --> 0:8:41,264
three transporters designed to carry the space shuttle.


96
0:8:41,264 --> 0:8:44,597
The crew must deliver their precious cargo before the airport


97
0:8:44,597 --> 0:8:50,965
reopens in 5 hours." It was literally going 2 miles an hour


98
0:8:50,965 --> 0:8:54,414
so one point on that friday night,it became the fastest


99
0:8:54,414 --> 0:9:5,281
building in the UK.Once safely in place over its foundations


100
0:9:5,281 --> 0:9:11,349
engineers jack the tower 87 metres up into the sky.


101
0:9:11,349 --> 0:9:14,814
Now air traffic controllers at Heathrow have a tower


102
0:9:14,814 --> 0:9:33,68
that lets them do their job without T5 getting in the way.


103
0:9:33,68 --> 0:9:36,281
Air Traffic Control  technology allows more planes


104
0:9:36,281 --> 0:9:44,331
to reach airports safely.But as airports become cluttered


105
0:9:44,331 --> 0:9:48,513
with aircraft,it gets more difficult for passengers to board


106
0:9:48,513 --> 0:9:57,35
and disembark safely.For London Gatwick to take on


107
0:9:57,35 --> 0:10:0,85
20,000 passengers,they need to bring planes 


108
0:10:0,85 --> 0:10:9,324
and passengers closer together,yet keep them apart.


109
0:10:9,324 --> 0:10:13,837
In the 1920s Air travel is only for the super rich.


110
0:10:13,837 --> 0:10:19,398
But conditions at the airfields are from first-class.


111
0:10:19,398 --> 0:10:23,82
" They had to walk across a windy apron to reach the plane


112
0:10:23,82 --> 0:10:25,882
,so it was a fairly sort of primitive kind of activity.


113
0:10:25,882 --> 0:10:29,94
And it wasn't consistent with the pampered rich."


114
0:10:29,94 --> 0:10:34,248
Boarding planes isn't just inconvenient,it can be downright


115
0:10:34,248 --> 0:10:40,535
dangerous.Propellers and human bodies don't mix.


116
0:10:40,535 --> 0:10:46,446
But in 1933 a young man has an idea.Morris Jackerman


117
0:10:46,446 --> 0:10:49,582
wants to offfer passengers at Gatwick Airport something


118
0:10:49,582 --> 0:10:54,731
revolutionary,a terminal,but he struggles to find the right 


119
0:10:54,731 --> 0:10:59,238
shape for the building." You could imagine that he was umm...


120
0:10:59,238 --> 0:11:1,446
he was playing with all the variables and he  was thinking 


121
0:11:1,446 --> 0:11:5,513
about the way the aircraft would position themselves


122
0:11:5,513 --> 0:11:10,706
taxiing in,and although that positioning of aircraft


123
0:11:10,706 --> 0:11:12,635
was good from the passengers point of view


124
0:11:12,635 --> 0:11:15,495
it wasn't good for the movement of the aircraft


125
0:11:15,495 --> 0:11:17,871
because if that aircraft is in position,that aircraft


126
0:11:17,871 --> 0:11:20,632
can't move.If that aircraft is in position that 


127
0:11:20,632 --> 0:11:25,471
aircraft can't move.And there's wasted space there


128
0:11:25,471 --> 0:11:29,522
he just couldn't make the square work an as far


129
0:11:29,522 --> 0:11:31,381
the said,you are going around in circles aren't


130
0:11:31,381 --> 0:11:33,547
you?.And it was then that he had that eureka


131
0:11:33,547 --> 0:11:37,683
moment that the circle is the solution and here is the


132
0:11:37,683 --> 0:11:44,564
end-product,still standing today,the beehive at Gatwick."


133
0:11:44,564 --> 0:11:48,396
Jackerman's design is revolutionary,its shape is ideal


134
0:11:48,396 --> 0:11:56,182
for both passenger and plane.Each aircraft can quickly


135
0:11:56,182 --> 0:12:0,915
and independently taxi to its gates to unload,refuel


136
0:12:0,915 --> 0:12:7,468
and load up again.And inside the Beehive 


137
0:12:7,468 --> 0:12:10,647
passengers wait in comfort,until telescopic canopy's


138
0:12:10,647 --> 0:14:10,647
take them right to the aircraft door.The beehive is the first
