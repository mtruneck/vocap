1
0:0:0,189 --> 0:0:2,7
senator or block


2
0:0:2,7 --> 0:0:6,22
allergies pretty blunt about who we
represent in terms of his monsanto


3
0:0:6,22 --> 0:0:9,779
uh... we wonder where the monsanto
protection act came from


4
0:0:9,779 --> 0:0:12,59
and appears it might have come from


5
0:0:12,59 --> 0:0:13,809
senator roadblocks office now


6
0:0:13,809 --> 0:0:15,389
he is uh...


7
0:0:15,389 --> 0:0:18,96
republican senator and he's not be shy
in the past about


8
0:0:18,96 --> 0:0:23,39
uh... pushing legislation that was in
favor of monsanto and snot any other


9
0:0:23,39 --> 0:0:27,449
corporation though that might give him a
donation now mother jones reports that


10
0:0:27,449 --> 0:0:29,72
he uh... was likely source


11
0:0:29,72 --> 0:0:32,399
of the monsanto protection i did you
don't know what that was


12
0:0:32,399 --> 0:0:33,469
as it was a little


13
0:0:33,469 --> 0:0:37,11
attachment to the budget bill that had
to pass a budget though overall


14
0:0:37,11 --> 0:0:41,3
but this attachment the need to be a
narrow all it wasn't saying that my


15
0:0:41,3 --> 0:0:43,829
central it and other cultural companies


16
0:0:43,829 --> 0:0:46,47
are protected from certain types of
lawsuits


17
0:0:46,47 --> 0:0:49,33
now that's outrageous why would they
need to be protected if the did


18
0:0:49,33 --> 0:0:52,8
something wrong they should go to court
like everybody else in the fatten them


19
0:0:52,8 --> 0:0:52,95
selves


20
0:0:52,95 --> 0:0:56,319
too for the congress to supersede the
courts and say no no


21
0:0:56,319 --> 0:1:0,46
this is a company that's above the law
is absolutely outrageous course though


22
0:1:0,46 --> 0:1:4,659
bombing administration did not object to
it and the democrats uh... are the ones


23
0:1:4,659 --> 0:1:6,3
that uh... also


24
0:1:6,3 --> 0:1:9,619
put it you know through while barbara
mikulski who runs that


25
0:1:9,619 --> 0:1:12,88
committee in the senate is a democrat
allowed to go forward


26
0:1:12,88 --> 0:1:15,87
as she says she's not in favor of it was
kinda funny way of showing it


27
0:1:15,87 --> 0:1:19,41
'cause she allowed in the into the belt


28
0:1:19,41 --> 0:1:21,699
if senator autoblog is the person who


29
0:1:21,699 --> 0:1:24,0
really did put afford a smoother joe
suggests


30
0:1:24,0 --> 0:1:28,25
well that makes some sense because they
also outlined where roy blount gets his


31
0:1:28,25 --> 0:1:32,939
money so how much the j from monsanto
recently well back in two thousand eight


32
0:1:32,939 --> 0:1:36,509
when he was in the house he to ten
thousand dollars from those the warm-up


33
0:1:36,509 --> 0:1:37,94
uh... legalize pride


34
0:1:37,94 --> 0:1:40,91
and twenty ten when he was running for
senate yet forty four thousand two


35
0:1:40,91 --> 0:1:44,62
hundred fifty dollars and then twenty
twelve when they were getting ready for


36
0:1:44,62 --> 0:1:46,72
the monsanto protection act


37
0:1:46,72 --> 0:1:50,36
well that's what i had a pony up sixty
four thousand two hundred fifty dollars


38
0:1:50,36 --> 0:1:53,11
well this is directly toured a lot


39
0:1:53,11 --> 0:1:55,25
what about the pax was one of those


40
0:1:55,25 --> 0:2:0,7
and the biz packs overall is all they
can call to companies have given


41
0:2:0,7 --> 0:2:3,79
a fifty one thousand dollars in twenty
twelve to wrote a blog


42
0:2:3,79 --> 0:2:5,4
and then twenty ten


43
0:2:5,4 --> 0:2:7,56
who when he was running for senate


44
0:2:7,56 --> 0:2:10,3
two hundred and forty three fx


45
0:2:10,3 --> 0:2:12,399
the house and all that


46
0:2:12,399 --> 0:2:13,569
narrower blunt


47
0:2:13,569 --> 0:2:17,119
according to public citizen of the
watchdog over these matters


48
0:2:17,119 --> 0:2:19,189
quote the legislative leader


49
0:2:19,189 --> 0:2:21,769
who not only has surrendered his office


50
0:2:21,769 --> 0:2:25,22
to the imperative monied interests but
who has also done so


51
0:2:25,22 --> 0:2:28,709
with two studies you'll and efficiency


52
0:2:28,709 --> 0:2:31,7
uh... he is also in the past for tobacco
companies


53
0:2:31,7 --> 0:2:33,639
his wife works for craft


54
0:2:33,639 --> 0:2:35,979
craft was also part of a


55
0:2:35,979 --> 0:2:38,53
trying to defeat california probs this
thirty-seven


56
0:2:38,53 --> 0:2:43,29
which would've label g_m_ os monsanto
also added to that effort


57
0:2:43,29 --> 0:2:46,949
four borders will be married to
corporate interest in this case


58
0:2:46,949 --> 0:2:50,759
uh... but you don't have to go that far
you're so that is num where yeses money


59
0:2:50,759 --> 0:2:52,879
when i've done yet


60
0:2:52,879 --> 0:2:55,239
coursework one is not the only one
taking mine


61
0:2:55,239 --> 0:2:58,959
democrats are also taking other
republicans as well when you look at who


62
0:2:58,959 --> 0:3:1,489
attire monsanto packed in its receipt


63
0:3:1,489 --> 0:3:5,34
