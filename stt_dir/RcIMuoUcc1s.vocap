###27 ROCCO CASTORO: I recently wrote an article for the
###28 technology issue of "Vice" about
###30 "The Anarchist Cookbook".
###31 And if you don't know what "The Anarchist Cookbook" is,
###33 it was written in 1971 by a 19-year-old
###36 named William Powell.
###37 It was a response to the Vietnam War and a type of
###40 field manual for civil unrest at the time.
###43 And it contains stuff like how to make TNT, how to kill
###46 people with your bare hands, firearms knowledge, and all
###49 sorts of fun stuff.
###50 A few years later he actually became a born again Christian
###53 and requested that the book be taken off the shelves and
###56 taken out of print.
###57 Unfortunately for him he didn't have that luxury
###59 because he sold the original copyright to the publisher and
###62 today you can still buy the thing on Amazon.
###64 Somewhere around the mid-1980s things took kind of an
###67 interesting turn with the heyday of
###70 bulletin board systems.
###72 Someone compiled this list of instructions on how to make
###76 low-grade explosives and stuff like flaming tennis balls, and
###80 just general malcontent shit.
###83 And somewhere along the line they appropriated William
###85 Powell's original title "The Anarchist Cookbook" and people
###88 started calling it that even though it had very little
###91 resemblance to the original.
###92 A lot of people know about "The Anarchist Cookbook" but I
###95 don't know too many people that have actually tried the
###97 entries out for themselves, and they're rumored to be very
###99 dangerous and incomplete and incorrect.
###101 So I thought it would be a good idea to head out to a
###103 warehouse in Brooklyn and just blow some shit up and see if
###106 there was any merit to these recipes.
###109 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###125 ROCCO CASTORO: It's pretty simple here.
###127 You just take Strike Anywhere matches--
###130 just going to be cutting the match heads off.
###133 I think we figured out that for each tennis ball you need
###138 about 3,000 match heads.
###140 And you want to cut in maybe a quarter of an inch, and get a
###145 split tennis ball.
###147 Let's do some sandpaper now.
###149 
###154 Literally drop your matches in there.
###156 
###160 Just in case Strike Anywhere match-filled tennis balls
###164 don't explode like we hope, we're going to have a plan B.
###167 And we're breaking apart some bottle rockets, getting the
###173 black powder out, and we're going to make a combination of
###177 matches and black powder in one of the balls.
###180 We don't know how many parts powder compared to how many
###185 parts matches we should be using, so we're just going to
###188 fill up the entire fucking thing.
###189 
###192 ED ZIPCO: Black powder.
###195 ROCCO CASTORO: Yeah, I mean we're going to need to pack it
###197 with a lot of the--
###199 ED ZIPCO: Sandpaper?
###200 ROCCO CASTORO: The sandpaper then.
###201 Maybe a little bit of cardboard.
###202 We just need it like filler, essentially.
###204 
###207 This is going to be test one of the flaming tennis ball.
###210 
###222 OK we're going to use the experimental version packed
###225 with black powder and match heads.
###230 - Whoa!
###231 [LAUGHTER]
###231 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###248 ROCCO CASTORO: I mean this was kind of silly to begin with--
###250 make blow darts out of these pipes, and
###254 yarn, and pencil erasers.
###257 Those are the directions and I suspected it wasn't really
###260 going to do anything.
###261 So basically you just take a pencil eraser, push it down to
###266 the end of the dart, which serves as a kind
###269 of a stopper here.
###271 You want to make sure you have, I think these are called
###275 beaded needles, with the hole in them.
###278 Some yarn which is going to act as kind of like a feather.
###283 Kind of stupid and silly--
###284 I didn't really think it was going to work that well, and
###288 it really doesn't.
###288 I don't know why anybody would really make one of these.
###290 Certainly couldn't defend yourself or hurt
###293 anybody with it.
###294 I think it's safe to say that this was definitely a failure,
###299 and "The Anarchist Cookbook", whoever wrote
###302 it, just wasn't thinking.
###304 [FAST MUSIC PLAYING]
###314 Apparently, if you make a pound of this, it will fill up
###318 an entire city block with smoke.
###319 Going to need four parts sugar, six
###322 parts potassium nitrate.
###323 It's pretty simple.
###325 Got here in your hot plate, you can use your stove if
###328 you're a little daring, I guess.
###330 Very low heat.
###334 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###344 ED ZIPCO: This is the first time where I felt like we're
###346 really cooking up something.
###347 It's like fucking foul.
###351 Oh wow.
###352 
###361 ROCCO CASTORO: This is what the saltpeter and sugar
###364 mixture turned into.
###365 We've got wicks and matches in it.
###368 We'll see what happens.
###369 If it smells as bad as it does now when it starts smoking
###372 then we're all in for a bad night.
###375 
###382 - Whoa!
###383 
###388 - Put it out.
###389 
###394 - That's awesome.
###396 ROCCO CASTORO: Basically the idea here, you've got the BB
###399 gun, you've got the can of hairspray.
###402 And what theoretically this is supposed to do, at least what
###405 "The Anarchist Cookbook" says it'll do, is spark the
###409 matches, also puncture the bottom of this can, and send
###414 it down the road.
###416 We're not doing it outside because there's a school
###418 across the street.
###418 Because we just think it's going to explode.
###422 ED ZIPCO: Dude, Nick?
###423 His fucking buddy, ah what the fuck was it, they threw a keg
###427 into a campfire.
###428 
###430 One kid got decapitated.
###432 ROCCO CASTORO: What?
###432 ED ZIPCO: It was for real, fucking like
###433 proper murder charges.
###436 They charged everybody, everyone who was involved.
###438 It was like a fucking thing.
###441 People got really fucked up.
###442 ROCCO CASTORO: Who was this?
###443 ED ZIPCO: One dude gone.
###443 Nick.
###443 He was here earlier.
###446 Shrapnel ain't a fucking joke.
###447 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###459 LOU: Did that hurt?
###460 
###463 Don't, don't, don't, don't!
###466 Seriously!
###466 Ow!
###469 Back up if you're going to do it.
###470 Back up [INAUDIBLE].
###472 
###474 ROCCO CASTORO: This is what we call the down the road rocket,
###476 and what "The Anarchist Cookbook" calls the down the
###477 road rocket.
###478 We've attached ours to a skateboard.
###480 It's a little modification.
###481 We don't think it's going to work, but if it doesn't work,
###483 we're going to either put some napalm in the back, or figure
###487 out a way to do it.
###488 [MUSIC - LIVEFASTDIE, "WEAPONS"]
###489 
###495 - What are we going to do now?
###496 LOU: Another one of these.
###497 But we're gonna light the matches.
###499 
###530 Whoa, shit!
###531 
###544 ROCCO CASTORO: Simple ingredients for napalm.
###548 Basically, take gasoline, put it in a bucket.
###553 Put as much Styrofoam as the gasoline will eat.
###557 So just keep feeding it the Styrofoam until it stops
###560 dissolving.
###561 You'll end up with a really nice little goo that you can
###564 spread on your baby sister, or a car, or
###568 somebody and burn forever.
###571 And it doesn't go out so make sure whatever you're burning
###575 you don't want.
###577 And you're able to control it somehow-- either be a big open
###582 space or some kind of space blanket you can throw over it
###588 because I don't know what else will put it out.
###591 ED ZIPCO: Yeah, but if we mash it down first,
###592 and we flatten it--
###593 MILES: Like that?
###594 ED ZIPCO: Yeah, look at that.
###594 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###597 [INAUDIBLE]
###598 
###647 - That's awesome!
###650 LANDLORD: Hey guys?
###651 As soon as you can, you should turn that off because if the
###654 sprinklers go off, all our equipment gets damaged, and
###656 that's quite a bit of--
###658 - OK.
###658 OK.
###659 OK Can we turn it on?
###661 - Yeah, but we're not turning it on.
###662 -No we're not.
###663 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###676 - That's badass.
###677 - That is so fucked up.
