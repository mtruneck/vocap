###5 Did you get the link I sent you?
###7 You've got to see this. It's hilarious.
###9 Yeah, it's still loading.
###10 Okay, go ahead, Troy, and make a muscle.
###12 All right, check out these guns.
###17 Those aren't muscles.
###19 These are muscles.
###23 Kevin. Kevin.
###25 Time for breakfast.
###26 Hey, dad.
###28 What are you doing, boy?
###30 I'm showing Troy my muscles.
###32 Those aren't muscles.
###35 These are muscles.
###36 Wow.
###37 Wow. My whole screen went black.
###40 It's like a bicep eclipse.
###43 Kevin's got to go eat breakfast.
###45 He'll see you later, Troy.
###46 Bye, Mr. Kingston-Persons.
###48 Catch you later.
###53 Kevin.
###55 Kevin, do you have my lotion in here again?
###57 I can't believe it's so round.
###59 It's, like, out there.
###60 I mean, it's gross. Look.

###127 What you making?
###128 Mom's teaching me how to make peppered salmon.
###130 Awesome.
###131 Peppered salmon is awesome?
###133 No, I just pulled up this viral video.
###135 It's an old lady dancing to <i>Baby Got Back.</i>
###138 I love dancing to that song,
###140 but who would record it and put it on the Internet?
###146 Look at this fool.
###148 She is a mess.
###149 Got not makeup on, looking like a ghetto Lady Gaga.
###158 Hey, that looks like your room.
###161 Baby, those look like your pajamas.
###163 What?
###165 Mom, that looks like...

###191 I didn't know you could dance like that, mom.
###193 Well, you weren't supposed to find out on the Internet.
###196 It's no big deal.
###197 Cats are put online all the time.
###199 Doesn't seem to bother them,
###200 because they just keep doing stuff that's hilarious.
###202 You ever see <i>surprised Kitty?</i>
###205 Pop!
###206 Pop!
###208 Pop!
###211 I am not a cat.
###213 I'm a wife and a working woman and a mother,
###215 and I'm not hilarious.
###217 How did this video even get on there?
###219 Did you record your mother without her knowing it?
###222 Ew, no.
###223 Did you leave your webcam running?
###225 I don't know.
###227 Maybe.
###228 Probably.
###230 I guess, yeah.
###233 Man, I told you, you got to be careful about that.
###235 You leave your webcam running,
###237 people can capture video on what they see from your computer
###239 whether you're there or not.
###241 I can't believe this happened.
###243 I'm on the Internet in my drawers
###245 doing the big butt dance.
###248 Could be worse. How?
###250 Could have been dancing to... ♪ ice, ice, baby ♪
###252 Dad.
###254 ♪ Ice, ice, baby ♪
###258 pop!
###260 Pop! Nick!
###261 Baby.
###263 What's she so upset about?
###265 I mean, it's not like it's a sex tape.
###268 What is wrong with you, man?
###279 So explain to me again why I'm here.
###282 We're having a little family emergency.
###284 Ooh, do I smell a divorce?
###286 No, ma.
###287 I need you to help Lindsey finish making dinner
###289 while I deal with Suzanne.
###290 I thought you invited me over here to eat dinner, not make it.
###293 If I'd have told you Suzanne and I were having a problem,
###295 would you have come?
###296 No.
###297 All right, then.
###298 So what's wrong with her?
###300 I mean, other than the obvious.
###302 It's a long story.
###304 Well, it better be over by 10:30.
###306 Mama got a hot date.
###308 Hot! Hot, honey, I tell you.
###310 Hot.
###311 Ma. What?
###314 How do you think you got here?
###320 I just feel so violated.
###323 You know, it's like I was spied on in my own house.
###325 What else can record me without my knowing it?
###328 Well, technically, anything that can receive a signal
###330 can transmit a signal.
###332 So the tv, telephone, radio, headphones.
###336 Ugh, you're not helping.
###338 I'm just trying to answer your question.
###340 Okay, Nick, you're an I.T. guy.
###341 This is your world.
###343 Isn't there some way to get the video off the Internet?
###345 Well, unfortunately, once something's up on the Web,
###348 it's there for good.
###349 But don't worry about it.
###351 This will go away. You're not Kim Kardashian.
###354 This week, it's you.
###356 Next week, it'll be a cat in a fishbowl.
###359 What is up with you and cats?
###361 Cats are funny.
###363 Look, you can't even tell it's you.
###366 Really?
###367 Really.
###368 Why do you think I hate it
###369 when you come to bed looking like that?
###374 Pop!
###375 Pop!
###376 Pop!
###381 No, you don't understand.
###383 I didn't put it on the Internet.
###385 Hello? Hello?
###387 Who's that?
###388 I just had another client cancel
###390 because they saw the video.
###394 Mom, what are you doing with my computer?
###397 It's my computer until you learn
###399 what that thing is capable of.
###401 I know what it's capable of.
###402 That's why I don't want you to take it.
###404 How am I supposed to communicate with my friends?
###406 Talk to them. How?
###408 Face-to-face.
###410 Like an old person?
###411 You know, Suzanne,
###413 I don't think the video's that big a deal.
###414 I mean, it's not like it's a sex tape.
###416 Though it'd be better for you if it were,
###417 because I guarantee nobody would want to see that.
###419 Aren't you supposed to be eating?
###421 I would if I had some real food.
###424 You don't like peppered salmon?
###425 It's mom's specialty.
###427 Specialty, huh?
###428 Lindsey, you need to learn how to cook some real food,
###431 because you are not gonna get a man cooking like this.
###434 I got a man cooking like this.
###436 Baby, believe me, it was not your cooking.
###438 Maybe it was your dancing.
###441 I want a man to like me for my mind and my personality,
###444 not how I look or how I cook.
###446 I had one of those once. It gets old fast, trust me.
###449 Maybe that's not what got old.
###451 You guys gonna eat or you gonna fight?
###453 All I'm saying is, I need to teach Lindsey
###455 how to cook some real soul food.
###457 What's soul food?
###458 The number two cause of death in black men over 40.
###462 What's the number one cause?
###463 Stress. Now, eat, please.
###471 Butter, butter, lard,
###476 chicken.
###478 What is wrong with this thing? It looks disgusting.
###481 What the heck is all this stuff wrapped around it?
###484 That's called the skin.
###486 Ew!
###488 No, you mean, "mmm."
###491 You see, the skin is what gives the chicken the flavor.
###494 Is this an organic free-range chicken?
###496 No, it's a flavorful hard-knock-life chicken.
###499 If that chicken was a rapper, it'd be Tupac.
###503 Ooh. What do we need vodka for?
###505 I'll give you a hint: It's not for the chicken.
###514 Mom!
###515 Mom!
###523 Kevin.
###524 Why do you have your computer when I took it away from you?
###527 I thought my punishment was over.
###528 Nuh-uh.
###529 I was just gonna watch a video.
###531 Were you gonna watch the video,
###533 or was the video going to watch you?
###535 Go put that computer up in my bedroom,
###537 and I don't want to see it back in your hands
###539 until I put it there.
###541 Yes, ma'am.
###548 Hi, Mrs. Kingston-Persons.
###550 Hi, Troy. Hi, Jackie.
###552 Come on in.
###553 Suzanne, can I talk to you for a moment?
###555 Sure.
###557 Suzanne, you need to be more responsible with your child.
###561 What are you talking about?
###562 Well, Troy was recording his Web chat
###565 with Kevin the other day,
###566 and the next thing he knows, you're in the room
###568 dancing around like Tila Tequila.
###571 I was shocked.
###573 Wait a minute. Troy did this?
###576 And you're upset with me because he recorded me
###578 in the privacy of my own home?
###580 He wouldn't have had anything to record
###581 if you were a little more responsible.
###584 I used to think the Internet was safe,
###586 but now...
###588 If you're so responsible, Jackie,
###590 than why is your son posting videos of people
###592 all over the Internet?
###594 For your information,
###596 he's not posting videos of people.
###598 He posted a video of you
###599 because the rest of the people weren't dancing around
###602 in their underwear.
###604 I feel like my innocence has been taken from me.
###609 Are you at least going to make him say he's sorry?
###612 Do you have any idea how many people might see this?
###615 1/2 million, but that was just yesterday.
###617 By tomorrow, you'll probably pass <i>printer cat.</i>
###624 What is so funny?
###626 I was just thinking about printer cat.
###629 Fump! Fump!
###630 Fump!
###633 Okay, if it makes you feel any better,
###635 Troy, just say you're sorry.
###637 Sorry, Mrs. Kingston-Persons.
###641 I hope you're satisfied.
###644 You need to be more responsible with your child.
###654 Ooh, if that lady pointed her finger at me one more time...
###658 Goodness gracious.
###662 I'm telling you, man, Suzanne's video is huge.
###665 She's, like, the featured video of the day
###667 on 15 different websites.
###669 You're wife might be the next Star Wars Kid.
###671 My wife is not gonna be the next Star Wars Kid.
###674 Turn it off.
###675 Turn what off? Nothing.
###676 Just some stupid cat videos.
###679 Oh, well, you guys must be the only ones watching that,
###682 because everyone else seems to be watching me.
###684 Did you know that video of me has over 1/2 million hits?
###688 That was yesterday.
###689 Today it's more like 3 1/2 million.
###692 What? Oh, yeah.
###693 You better hope that none of those kids watching this video
###695 is good with Photoshop.
###698 Ow.
###699 Nick, you're my man,
###700 and you said that this was gonna go away.
###702 So I don't know how you're gonna do it,
###704 but you have got to get that video off the Web.
###706 What am I supposed to do?
###708 I can't just shut down the Internet.
###710 Have you tried?
###716 Listen, man, you do what you need to do,
###717 but if you shut down the Internet,
###719 you and me are gonna have a problem.
###721 Ah!
###729 Suzanne, why aren't you dressed?
###731 We got to get going.
###732 I can't think of work at a time like this.
###734 Because it's time to go to work.
###736 Well, I'm not going to work. I'm too embarrassed.
###738 Oh, gosh.
###740 Are you still worried about the stupid video?
###741 Gigi, that stupid video has over 5 million hits,
###744 and obviously somebody at work recognized me,
###746 because my inbox is filled of videos
###748 of me dancing to <i>Baby Got Back.</i>
###750 I even got an email from Sir Mix-a-Lot.
###753 Well, it could be worse.
###754 How?
###756 You could be dancing to <i>Everybody Dance Now,</i>
###758 and lord knows you don't want an email from Freedom Williams.
###761 Why do I keep falling for that?
###764 Well, you know what?
###765 You don't have anything to be embarrassed about.
###767 Look at all these cool comments.
###768 People think it's great,
###770 think it's fun.
###772 Ha! You're making 'em laugh.
###774 Gigi, it's not funny.
###775 How would you feel if this were a video of you?
###778 If this were a video of me, I wouldn't be dancing,
###781 and there would be a whole different set of comments.
###791 Okay. I have Suzanne's video up.
###794 Okay, click play and tell me what happens.
###798 Oh, wait a second.
###800 I got, like, a billion pop-ups here.
###803 Well, as a matter of fact,
###804 I would like to meet singles in my area.
###806 Thank you for asking.
###808 Okay, now the screen just froze.
###811 Good. It works.
###813 You wanted this to happen?
###814 I can't shut down the Internet,
###816 but I can shut down the people.
###818 If they try to watch this video,
###819 it'll be the last thing they watch.
###821 So you're willing to crash 20 million computers
###824 to save one marriage?
###825 Yes. Yes, I am.
###833 Okay, now put a little salt in it.
###835 Okay.
###837 Oh, baby, they haven't taught you anything, have they?
###841 Excuse me.
###843 This is how you put a little salt in it.
###846 Stir it up. Okay.
###848 Mmm, that smells good.
###851 What are we having?
###852 Well, Lindsey is making southern fried chicken,
###855 macaroni and cheese, and collard greens.
###857 And Marilyn's teaching me how to make pot liquor.
###861 Pot liquor.
###864 I hope she's also teaching you how to make a cure
###866 for type 2 diabetes.
###868 Ha!
###869 Type 2 diabetes.
###871 I worry about that kid.
###873 For your information, I also taught Lindsey
###875 how to make my sweet potato pound cake.
###877 Of course, you won't want any,
###879 because you're afraid you might get type 2 diabetes.
###881 Pfft!
###883 Type 2.
###887 Type 2. You're funny.
###889 Don't look at me.
###891 I don't know what's wrong with him.
###892 You made sweet potato pound cake?
###894 Yup, with buttercream frosting.
###896 Oh, my goodness.
###898 See?
###899 I told you men can't resist soul food.
###901 You were right.
###902 This pound cake gonna make my blood pressure go up.
###905 Well, have one of these.
###906 It'll send it right back down.
###907 Ha!
###910 Blood pressure!
###919 Great.
###920 Now my computer is frozen.
###922 Well, try hitting the escape button.
###924 I tried that. It didn't work.
###925 It's still frozen.
###926 Why do they even have an escape button
###928 if it doesn't help you escape?
###930 It feels more like a trap.
###932 Well, press the command key
###933 and start hitting all the other keys.
###934 What does that do?
###936 I don't know, but we're about to find out.
###938 Suzanne.
###940 I've solved your problem.
###943 Thank you, honey,
###944 but now I have a new problem.
###946 I clicked on my video, and my computer is frozen.
###949 That's not the problem.
###952 That's the solution.
###953 Just restart your computer, and everything will be fine.
###956 I don't understand.
###958 I'm your man.
###961 You're responsible for this.
###963 Yes, I am.
###964 I figured I couldn't stop the video from circulating,
###967 so I attached a virus
###968 to the keywords associated to the video.
###971 Now people will stay away from your video like the plague.
###975 I have my own virus.
###976 Yes, you do.
###978 Oh, my God. That is so romantic.
###982 I want a virus.
###984 Give it time.
###987 Nick.
###988 Come on. She'll get one.
###995 Dad gave you a virus. That's awesome.
###999 Yes, it is awesome,
###1000 but what wasn't awesome was you leaving your webcam running
###1003 so Troy could record me.
###1005 I know.
###1006 I'm sorry.
###1008 It's okay. Apology accepted.
###1010 Here's your computer back.
###1012 Thanks. Mm-hmm.
###1014 Mom, have you seen the lotion?
###1019 Produce some ashy elbows,
###1021 and then maybe you can have the lotion back.
###1031 Sweetheart, this is delicious.
###1034 You did a fantastic job.
###1036 Thank you.
###1037 I'm gonna have use my bullworker for five hours
###1039 to burn off all these calories.
###1041 Pass the gravy.
###1042 I love gravy. I love gravy too.
###1045 Gravy goes with everything:
###1047 Chicken, biscuits, mashed potatoes.
###1049 Gravy even tastes good with gravy.
###1051 This gravy's so good, you don't need the food.
###1054 I gained three pounds just smelling it.
###1056 I'm gonna have to dance like you in that video
###1058 to burn it off.
###1060 You know, now that I think about it,
###1062 the video was kind of funny.
###1064 Plus, it all worked out in my favor.
###1065 It was so popular, I actually gained clients from it.
###1068 Wow.
###1069 See, that's great.
###1071 Everything worked out for the best.
###1074 Ooh, I haven't ate like this in years.
###1076 You used to eat like this?
###1078 Sure, every day when I played football.
###1080 You didn't get to be 300 pounds
###1081 by eating flavorless, skinless, stress-free chicken.
###1086 You know, as much as I hate to admit it,
###1088 this is just like a Sunday dinner.
###1093 Mmm. Mmm.
###1094 Wow. That's really good.
###1096 Mm-hmm. Oh, my goodness.

###1122 experts have dubbed "the dancing housewife virus."
###1125 Apparently, when you click on this viral video
###1128 of a woman dancing
###1129 to Sir Mix-a-Lot's hit <i>Baby Got Back,</i>
###1132 it freezes your computer,
###1134 sends you countless pop-up ads,
###1136 and, in some extreme cases,
###1138 wipes out your entire hard drive.
###1163 Ew.
###1169 What time is it?
###1172 It's Thursday.
###1174 Oh, I forgot to warn you guys.
###1176 It's one of the side effects of eating soul food.
###1178 It's been known to put you to sleep.
###1180 For a day and a half?
###1184 Ooh, my ears keep ringing.
###1186 That's not your ears. That's the doorbell.
###1189 Oh.
###1190 Coming.
###1192 Ooh. Ooh.

###1206 Hi, Mrs. Kingston-Persons.
###1207 Hi, Mr. Kingston-Persons.
###1209 Hi, Troy.
###1211 You guys have cake?
###1213 In the kitchen.
###1216 What can we do for you, Jackie?
###1218 The dancing housewife virus crashed my computer.
###1220 I need you to fix it.
###1221 What does that have to do with me?
###1223 Well, if your wife hadn't been prancing around on the Internet,
###1225 none of this would have happened.
###1228 If you knew there was a virus, Jackie,
###1230 why would you click on the video?
###1234 I was trying to figure out how you did it.
###1244 Is she still doing it, Nick?
###1247 Yeah. Mm-hmm.
###1249 Maybe you could show me.
###1251 Want some cake?
###1253 We got some, uh, sweet potato pound cake.
###1257 Let me fix it. Let me fix it.
