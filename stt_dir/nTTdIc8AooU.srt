CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: One of the world`s
most powerful countries is selecting a new


2
0:0:4,6 --> 0:0:7,529
leader. We are not talking about the U.S.
election, but we have a lot of follow-up on


3
0:0:7,529 --> 0:0:23,839
that at well. Welcome to CNN STUDENT NEWS.


4
0:0:23,839 --> 0:0:28,269
We are starting with the U.S. presidential
election. The election night audience wasn`t


5
0:0:28,269 --> 0:0:33,9
limited to the United States. From South America
to Europe, Africa to the Middle East and Asia,


6
0:0:33,9 --> 0:0:36,1
the world was watching as results came in
on Tuesday night.

8
0:0:36,75 --> 0:0:40,329
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It`s a day to celebrate
for Barack Obama supporters. Let`s get to


9
0:0:40,329 --> 0:0:47,76
the big headlines at this moment. Barack Obama
is reelected U.S. president. The first picture


10
0:0:47,76 --> 0:1:1,21
of the first couple`s victory as Obama tweets
a thank you to his voters for a second term.


11
0:1:1,21 --> 0:1:7,96
(END VIDEO CLIP)


12
0:1:7,96 --> 0:1:13,83
AZUZ: So people were watching the election
in the real world, and many of them were talking


13
0:1:13,83 --> 0:1:18,51
about the election in the digital one. Karin
Caifa look at the role that social media took


14
0:1:18,51 --> 0:1:21,94
on during election day and some of the trends
that defined the day.


15
0:1:21,94 --> 0:1:22,63
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


16
0:1:22,63 --> 0:1:26,67
KARIN CAIFA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: As election
day turned into election night, millions of


17
0:1:26,67 --> 0:1:32,43
votes and how they added up generated million
of tweets, leading up to this one: a thank


18
0:1:32,43 --> 0:1:35,56
you from a newly reelected president of the
United States.


19
0:1:35,56 --> 0:1:38,72
BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA: For the United States of America,


20
0:1:38,72 --> 0:1:40,54
the best is yet to come.


21
0:1:40,54 --> 0:1:41,9
(APPLAUSE)


22
0:1:41,9 --> 0:1:47,18
CAIFA: Election day 2012 took its place as
Twitter`s biggest political event ever. And


23
0:1:47,18 --> 0:1:53,25
as TV networks called the race, second screens
lit up at a rate of more than 327,000 tweets


24
0:1:53,25 --> 0:1:58,77
per minute. Google searches pointed to an
anxious electorate. Top search terms during


25
0:1:58,77 --> 0:2:3,8
the day included "election results", "exit
polls", "election news" and "Who`s winning


26
0:2:3,8 --> 0:2:9,299
the election?" On Facebook, the number one
term Tuesday morning and afternoon, variations


27
0:2:9,299 --> 0:2:15,359
of "vote", "voted", and "go vote." After projections,
"Obama wins" jumped to the top spots on both


28
0:2:15,359 --> 0:2:17,209
Facebook and Google.


29
0:2:17,209 --> 0:2:22,459
Meanwhile, among Instagram photos, a bevy
of proud ballot shots raised legal questions


30
0:2:22,459 --> 0:2:28,45
in states with restrictions on photography
in polling places. In November 2008, about


31
0:2:28,45 --> 0:2:33,859
37 percent of Americans said they used a social
networking site. Fast forward to 2012, two


32
0:2:33,859 --> 0:2:35,26
thirds are socially engaged.


33
0:2:35,26 --> 0:2:37,459
MITT ROMNEY, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:
You guys are the best.


34
0:2:37,459 --> 0:2:42,59
CAIFA: And while Republicans made social strides,
they are still catching up to do -- Mitt Romney


35
0:2:42,59 --> 0:2:48,34
amassed a respectable 1.7 million Twitter
follows during his campaign; still, just a


36
0:2:48,34 --> 0:2:52,4
fraction of President Obama`s over 22 million.


37
0:2:52,4 --> 0:2:54,43
In Chicago, I`m Karin Caifa.


38
0:2:54,43 --> 0:2:55,42
(END VIDEOTAPE)


39
0:2:55,42 --> 0:2:59,439
AZUZ: Well, President Obama has been elected
to a second term in the White House, but the


40
0:2:59,439 --> 0:3:4,67
next four years could present some big challenges
for the president and the country. The fiscal


41
0:3:4,67 --> 0:3:10,98
cliff has to do with the U.S. debt, some spending
cuts and tax increases are said to kick in


42
0:3:10,98 --> 0:3:15,639
unless President Obama and Congress can come
up with other ways to get the country`s debt


43
0:3:15,639 --> 0:3:21,389
under control. Most American voters said the
economy was the number one issue in this election.


44
0:3:21,389 --> 0:3:25,519
One thing the financial experts look at in
order to figure out how the economy is doing


45
0:3:25,519 --> 0:3:30,349
is the U.S. stock markets, specifically, the
Dow Jones Industrial Average. Yesterday, it


46
0:3:30,349 --> 0:3:36,269
dropped more than 300 points, the worst one
day drop in a year. So, things are still pretty


47
0:3:36,269 --> 0:3:40,889
rough on Wall Street, and that`s why economic
issues like the fiscal cliff are going to


48
0:3:40,889 --> 0:3:42,519
get a lot of attention.


49
0:3:42,519 --> 0:3:46,42
What else lies ahead for the president`s second
term? There is a possibility he could nominate


50
0:3:46,42 --> 0:3:51,489
more justices to the U.S. Supreme Court. He
nominated two during his first term, plus


51
0:3:51,489 --> 0:3:55,529
some members of the president`s cabinet have
said they`ll step down, so he`ll need to fill


52
0:3:55,529 --> 0:3:57,79
those positions as well.


53
0:3:57,79 --> 0:4:1,779
Before we leave election night behind, we
want to point out some firsts that happened


54
0:4:1,779 --> 0:4:7,609
on Tuesday. Same-sex marriage became legal
in Maryland and Maine. A similar vote in Washington


55
0:4:7,609 --> 0:4:12,49
was still pending. Judges and legislators
have approved it in other states, but this


56
0:4:12,49 --> 0:4:16,19
was the first time that voters approved same-sex
marriage.


57
0:4:16,19 --> 0:4:20,91
In Wisconsin, Tammy Baldwin became the first
openly gay politician elected to the U.S.


58
0:4:20,91 --> 0:4:25,25
Senate. She`s also the first woman elected
to the Senate from Wisconsin.


59
0:4:25,25 --> 0:4:30,39
Voters in two states, Colorado and Washington,
approved legalizing marijuana. That`s a first,


60
0:4:30,39 --> 0:4:35,12
but it`s also not a done deal. The federal
government says marijuana is illegal, and


61
0:4:35,12 --> 0:4:40,38
that overrules states rights in this case.
And for the first time, a majority of voters


62
0:4:40,38 --> 0:4:45,44
in Puerto Rico said they would like the U.S.
territory to change its status and become


63
0:4:45,44 --> 0:4:47,13
a U.S. state.


64
0:4:47,13 --> 0:4:48,82
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


65
0:4:48,82 --> 0:4:55,78
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Just the facts: in 1949,
China officially changed its name to the People`s


66
0:4:55,78 --> 0:5:1,29
Republic of China. The country had existed
for centuries, but 1949 was when China became


67
0:5:1,29 --> 0:5:7,16
a communist nation. In a communist country,
the government controls the economy and one


68
0:5:7,16 --> 0:5:9,9
political party holds all the power.


69
0:5:9,9 --> 0:5:12,71
(END VIDEO CLIP)


70
0:5:12,71 --> 0:5:17,6
AZUZ: That government and country are set
to get a new leader. Now, there won`t be a


71
0:5:17,6 --> 0:5:22,25
new party in charge of China. The Communist
Party will still lead the country`s government,


72
0:5:22,25 --> 0:5:27,47
but there will be a different person heading
up that party. Every five years, more than


73
0:5:27,47 --> 0:5:32,43
2,200 delegates from the Communist Party Congress
get together. They evaluate the country`s


74
0:5:32,43 --> 0:5:37,19
progress and set new directions for China.
Every ten years, they pick new leadership.


75
0:5:37,19 --> 0:5:42,38
That process started today. Most, maybe all
of the decisions are determined in advance.


76
0:5:42,38 --> 0:5:47,9
And that`s why we can tell you that this man,
Xi Jingping, is expected to be China`s next


77
0:5:47,9 --> 0:5:51,9
president. He`s been the vice president for
nearly 5 years, but some experts describe


78
0:5:51,9 --> 0:5:56,3
Xi as a mystery. They say they are not sure
what type of leader he would be.


79
0:5:56,3 --> 0:5:57,59
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


80
0:5:57,59 --> 0:6:3,44
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What`s the word? It`s
a type of winter storm that commonly hits


81
0:6:3,44 --> 0:6:7,14
this part of the United States.


82
0:6:7,14 --> 0:6:12,56
Nor`easter. That`s the word.


83
0:6:12,56 --> 0:6:14,56
(END VIDEO CLIP)


84
0:6:14,56 --> 0:6:19,61
AZUZ: There is one of those bearing down on
the Northeastern U.S. right now. Yes, this


85
0:6:19,61 --> 0:6:24,37
is the same part of the country that was hit
less than two weeks ago by Sandy. A lot of


86
0:6:24,37 --> 0:6:29,19
people still recovering from that storm. Hundreds
of thousands still don`t have power. And now


87
0:6:29,19 --> 0:6:33,3
they are going to have to deal with this two.
You are looking at more rain, more wind, now


88
0:6:33,3 --> 0:6:38,31
add snow to the mix. The Nor`easter could
drive temperatures down into the `20s, and


89
0:6:38,31 --> 0:6:43,71
that could be a serious problem for the thousands
of people whose homes don`t have heat or power.


90
0:6:43,71 --> 0:6:45,47
Rob Marciano has more on these winter storms.


91
0:6:45,47 --> 0:6:46,11
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


92
0:6:46,11 --> 0:6:49,19
ROB MARCIANO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: A Nor`easter
is the storm that typically happens in the


93
0:6:49,19 --> 0:6:54,19
Northeast. That`s not why it`s called a Nor`easter,
though. The name comes from the wind or the


94
0:6:54,19 --> 0:6:58,68
prevailing wind that you typically get from
that sort of storm, which is out of the Northeast,


95
0:6:58,68 --> 0:7:5,85
and the bigger, stronger the storm, the stronger
the Nor`east wind is.


96
0:7:5,85 --> 0:7:12,44
Nor`easters are typically a weak storm that
make their way across the U.S. and will get


97
0:7:12,44 --> 0:7:16,18
a little bit of energy from the jet stream,
and then when they heat the coast, that difference


98
0:7:16,18 --> 0:7:20,5
in temperature between the land and the ocean,
that gives them a little bit more in the way


99
0:7:20,5 --> 0:7:26,67
of instability and more fuel for the fire.


100
0:7:26,67 --> 0:7:32,61
Common characteristics of a Nor`easter are
wind, rain, sometimes snow, definitely waves


101
0:7:32,61 --> 0:7:35,7
battering the coastline, and because of that
you can get some beach erosion, you can get


102
0:7:35,7 --> 0:7:41,68
some coastal flooding. A storm surge is possible
as well. So, a lot of damage can be done not


103
0:7:41,68 --> 0:7:46,87
only along the shoreline, but also inland
in form of winds and heavy snow. Sometimes


104
0:7:46,87 --> 0:7:52,3
Nor`easters can dump several feet of snow,
especially at the higher terrain.


105
0:7:52,3 --> 0:7:58,4
Nor`easters typically happen anywhere really
from September all the way to May. The more


106
0:7:58,4 --> 0:8:2,69
intense ones happen really in the fall and
winter time, but spring time, you can get


107
0:8:2,69 --> 0:8:6,97
some Nor`easters that have some devastating
winds.


108
0:8:6,97 --> 0:8:13,2
Nor`easters and hurricanes are completely
different, because they derive their energy


109
0:8:13,2 --> 0:8:19,63
from two completely different sources. Your
hurricanes get your energy from the warm waters


110
0:8:19,63 --> 0:8:25,47
of the Atlantic Ocean, and that latent heat
relays is what drives the engine. Once a hurricane


111
0:8:25,47 --> 0:8:27,91
goes on land, it loses its energy.


112
0:8:27,91 --> 0:8:34,11
A Nor`easter gets its energy from the differences
between hot and cold. Often, a blizzard will


113
0:8:34,11 --> 0:8:39,459
come from a strong Nor`easter. And some cases,
they can be one and the same. Blinding snow


114
0:8:39,459 --> 0:8:45,139
and wind, winds blowing 35-40 miles an hour.
And obviously, devastating cold. And that`s


115
0:8:45,139 --> 0:8:49,999
why the strongest Nor`easters typically happen
in fall and winter, when you have that dynamic


116
0:8:49,999 --> 0:8:51,759
contrast in temperatures.


117
0:8:51,759 --> 0:8:52,85
(END VIDEOTAPE)


118
0:8:52,85 --> 0:8:57,569
AZUZ: Well, finally today, we are going to
talk about a ping-pong player that is a machine.


119
0:8:57,569 --> 0:9:2,61
Well, at least we warned you. This robotic
returner is a ping-pong prodigy. It`s on display


120
0:9:2,61 --> 0:9:8,1
at an event in China. The robot`s eyes have
cameras that collect images of the ball, and


121
0:9:8,1 --> 0:9:13,259
then it takes it 50 to 100 milliseconds to
respond and hit the ball back. Actually it


122
0:9:13,259 --> 0:9:16,68
seems kind of like the ball is coming right
to it. So, if you were to really challenge


123
0:9:16,68 --> 0:9:20,91
this thing, it might be in for some trouble.
If it couldn`t keep up, it could be up the


124
0:9:20,91 --> 0:9:24,829
creek without a pedal. But for the engineers
building it, they could still get some valuable


125
0:9:24,829 --> 0:9:27,86
information. And besides, it seems like they
are doing pretty well, considering the net


126
0:9:27,86 --> 0:9:29,23
results so far.


127
0:9:29,23 --> 0:9:32,31
Coming up with puns like that is always a
ball, and we really gave them our best shot,


128
0:9:32,31 --> 0:9:37,24
and now it`s time for us to go so, we will
serve up more headlines tomorrow on CNN STUDENT


129
0:9:37,24 --> 0:11:37,24
