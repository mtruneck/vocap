ONE OF THE BOMBING SUSPECTS.
THEY'VE BEEN SEARCHING FOR THE OTHER.

0:2:4,99 --> 0:2:13,379
THIS IS THE MAN POLICE HAVE BEEN SEARCHING
FOR ALL DAY.


13
0:2:13,379 --> 0:2:17,98
THE MAN THE FBI HAD CALLED SUSPECT NUMBER
TWO.


14
0:2:17,98 --> 0:2:21,87
AGENTS SAY HIS OLDER BROTHER WAS SUSPECT NUMBER

15
0:2:21,87 --> 0:2:27,489
HE IS DEAD KILLED IN A SHOOT OUT EARLIER TODAY
BY POLICE.


16
0:2:27,489 --> 0:2:36,29
ACTIVITY CAME AFTER A STAY IN PLACE ORDER
FOR BOSTON.


17
0:2:36,29 --> 0:2:43,25
THEY'VE BEEN DOING A DOOR TO DOOR SEARCH.
OFFICERS ENTERED HOMES ON 20 STREETS LOOKING


18
0:2:43,25 --> 0:2:48,87
FOR ANY SIGN.
EARLIER IN THE DAY HIS URNGAL SPOKE TO THE


19

0:3:7,909 --> 0:3:12,9
>> >>DWANE: THE SEARCH INTENSIFIED LAST NIGHT
HOURS AFTER FBI RELEASED PHOTOS OF THE SUSPECTS


22
0:3:12,9 --> 0:3:40,59
AN MIT CAMPUS POLICE OFFICERS WAS FOUND SHOT.
THEN A CAR JACKING IN AND 
A VIOLENT CAR CHASE ENSUED WITH GUN DPIER


23
0:3:40,59 --> 0:3:56,76
CHANGE.
ONE OF THE SUSPECTS WAS KILLED IN THE 


24
0:3:56,76 --> 0:4:23,56
FIRE FIGHT.
HERE IS SOME OF 
WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE SUSPECTS RIGHT NOW,


25
0:4:23,56 --> 0:4:28,7
AS WE SAID BEFORE THEY ARE BROTHERS, THEY
ARE ETHNIC CHECHENS, FAMILY MEMBERS SAY THEY'VE


26
0:4:28,7 --> 0:4:33,31
BEEN IN THE U.S. FOR CLOSE TO 10 YEARS. THE
YOUNGER BROTHER IS REPORTEDLY A MEDICAL STUDENT.


27
0:4:33,31 --> 0:4:40,69
THE UNCLE SAYS THE YOUNGER BROTHER CALLED
LAST NIGHT TO APOLOGIZE FOR A RIFT IN THE


28
0:4:40,69 --> 0:4:43,69
FAMILY.
ANOTHER SAYS THE BROTHERS BROUGHT SHAME TO


29
0:4:43,69 --> 0:4:52,37
THE FAMILY AND CHECHENS.
>> >>: BEING LOSERS, HATRED TO THOSE WHO WERE


30
0:4:52,37 --> 0:4:57,84
ABLE TO SETTLE THEMSELVES THESE ARE THE ONLY
REASONS I CAN IMAGINE.


31
0:4:57,84 --> 0:5:4,95
ANYTHING ELSE, ANYTHING ELSE WITH RELIGION,
WITH IZ LM, IT'S A FRAUD, IT'S A FAKE.


32
0:5:4,95 --> 0:5:9,28
>> >>DWANE: PEAK PEGGY PICO BRINGS US SOME
LOCAL REACTION TO THIS STORY.


33
0:5:9,28 --> 0:5:13,95
>> >>PEGGY: LIKE MOST COMMUNITIES AROUND THE
COUNTRY, SAN DIEGO HAS KEPT CLOSE TABS ON


34
0:5:13,95 --> 0:5:18,45
UNFOLDING EVENTS IN BOSTON TODAY.
JOINING ME WITH SOME LOCAL REACTION IS KPBS


35
0:5:18,45 --> 0:5:27,63
INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER AMITA SHARMA.
AMITA, YOU WERE OUT AND ABOUT.


36
0:5:27,63 --> 0:5:35,61
>> >>AMITA: WE ENGAGED IN A LITTLE BIT OF
SOUL SEARCHING HOW TO LOCALIZE THIS STORY


37
0:5:35,61 --> 0:5:40,92
TO SAN DIEGO.
THERE AREN'T A LOT OF CHECHEN PEOPLE WHO LIVE


38
0:5:40,92 --> 0:5:42,97
HERE.
I MEAN, THERE'S SOME CHECHEN CAB DRIVERS,


39
0:5:42,97 --> 0:5:47,11
BUT NO ORGANIZED CHECHEN COMMUNITY WHO CARED
TO SPEAK ABOUT THIS.


40
0:5:47,11 --> 0:5:54,47
THEN NEWS STARTED TRICKLING OUT ABOUT THE
STATE OF THESE TWO SUSPECTS, THE TWO BROTHERS.


41
0:5:54,47 --> 0:5:57,11
IT IS ISLAM.
ONE OF THE BROTHERS, THE YOUNGER BROTHER I


42
0:5:57,11 --> 0:6:0,5
BELIEVE HAD WRITTEN ON FACEBOOK THAT HIS WORLD
VIEW IS ISLAM.


43
0:6:0,5 --> 0:6:6,15
THE OLDER BROTHER CONSIDERS HIMSELF AT LEAST
ON FACEBOOK @ AS A DEVOUT MUSLIM.


44
0:6:6,15 --> 0:6:14,58
SO WE WENT TO GO TALK TO THE CLAIREMONT MOSQUE.
HE IS SOMEBODY WHO HAS MET WITH COMMUNITY


45
0:6:14,58 --> 0:6:21,5
GROUPS OVER THE YEARS QUITE FREQUENTLY TO
TALK ABOUT THE PUBLIC PERCEPTION OF THESE


46
0:6:21,5 --> 0:6:26,27
TERRORIST ACTS WHEN THEY ARE COMMITTED BY
ISLAMIC RADICALS SOAVMENT, YOU SO, YOU KNOW,


47
0:6:26,27 --> 0:6:31,62
WE WANTED TO TALK TO HIM ABOUT HIS RKS TO
THE EVENTS THIS WEEK AS THEY UNFOAD LD.


48
0:6:31,62 --> 0:6:37,96
HE SAID BASICALLY HE HAD REACTED TO THE BOMBINGS
IN BOSTON ON MONDAY AS ANY PERSON WOULD.


49
0:6:37,96 --> 0:6:44,11
HERE'S WHAT HE HAD TO SAY.
>> >>: WE HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THE NEWS CLOSELY.


50
0:6:44,11 --> 0:6:51,65
AND WE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE SAFETY
OF PEOPLE AND PROPERTIES IN THE BOSTON AREA.


51
0:6:51,65 --> 0:7:1,68
AND AS ANY FAITH BASED COMMUNITY AND ETHNIC
GROUP, WE FELT VERY SORRY FOR WHAT HAPPENED


52
0:7:1,68 --> 0:7:6,11
TO THE INNOCENT PEOPLE.
WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A CRIME.


53
0:7:6,11 --> 0:7:10,71
AND REGARDLESS WHO IS BEHIND IT.
>> >>PEGGY: THAT WAS SORT OF GENERAL TAKE


54
0:7:10,71 --> 0:7:13,45
ON IT.
WHEN YOU TOLD HIMﾊ WHEN HE LEARNED THE TWO


55
0:7:13,45 --> 0:7:18,2
SUSPECTS IN THE BOMBING WERE CHECH EXPN MUSLIM,
WHAT WAS HIS REACTION TO THAT?


56
0:7:18,2 --> 0:7:21,86
>> >>AMITA: HE SAID THE IRONY WAS HIS REACTION
DIDN'T CHANGE.


57
0:7:21,86 --> 0:7:27,74
HE'S WELL AWARE THAT THE PUBLIC'S REACTION
MOA MORE THAN LIKELY HAS CHANGED.


58
0:7:27,74 --> 0:7:33,13
IN OTHER WORDS RS ONCE THE PUBLIC LEARNED
THAT THESE TWO SUSPECTS WERE CHECHEN, THAT


59
0:7:33,13 --> 0:7:40,9
THEY WERE MUSLIM, THEIR ETHNICITY, THEIR FAITH,
HE'Sﾊ HE BELIEVES THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL


60
0:7:40,9 --> 0:7:47,78
USE THIS JUST TO REINFORCE THE BELIEF THAT
ISLAM SOME HOW MOTIVATES TERRORISM.


61
0:7:47,78 --> 0:7:55,44
>> >>PEGGY: A FALSE BELIEF, NECESSARILY.
>> >>AMITA: THAT'S A DEBATE FOR ANOTHER TIME,


62
0:7:55,44 --> 0:7:59,39
ANOTHER SHOW.
I ASKED HIM IF HE WAS TIRED OF BEING APPROACHED


63
0:7:59,39 --> 0:8:7,17
BY JOURNALISTS TO TALK ABOUT TERRORISM WHENEVER
THERE IS AN ACT COMMITTED BY AN ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALIST


64
0:8:7,17 --> 0:8:11,18
ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD, AND HIS RESPONSE WAS
MIXED.


65
0:8:11,18 --> 0:8:16,71
>> >>: YES, AND NO.
YES, BECAUSE YOU KNOW I EXPECTED THIS AND


66
0:8:16,71 --> 0:8:22,27
NO BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT MY JOB AS AN IMAM
OF THIS COMMUNITY IS TO NULLIFY THESE KINDS


67
0:8:22,27 --> 0:8:25,34
OF CONCEPTIONS.
THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO TELL


68
0:8:25,34 --> 0:8:29,7
EVERYONE THAT ISLAM HAS NOTHING TO GOO WITH
SUCH CRIMES.


69
0:8:29,7 --> 0:8:35,6
THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE PRESENTED THEMSELVES
THEY SHOULD BE DEALT WITH AS CRIMINALLED.


70
0:8:35,6 --> 0:8:41,12
>> >>PEGGY: SAN DIEGO HAS NOTORIOUS LINKS
TO HIGH PROFILE HAIR RS ACTS AND CRIMINALS


71
0:8:41,12 --> 0:8:45,62
OVER THE DECADE.
>> >>AMITA: THAT'S RIGHT, PEGGY.


72
0:8:45,62 --> 0:8:53,46
ACTUALLY TWO OF THE IS SEPTEMBERﾊ11 HIGH
JACKERS LIVED HERE, STUDIED HERE, WORSHIPED


73
0:8:53,46 --> 0:8:58,51
HERE BEFORE THEY FLEW A PLANE INTO THE PENTAGON
ON SEPTEMBERﾊ11.


74
0:8:58,51 --> 0:9:5,79
THEY ALSO MET PLIEIVE PRIVATELY QUITE FREQUENTLY
WITH AN IMAM AT A MOSQUE IN LA MESA.


75
0:9:5,79 --> 0:9:13,58
THIS IMAM IS NONE OTHER THAN WHO WAS CONSIDERED
A LEADER OF AL QAEDA ON THE ARAB PENINSULA.


76
0:9:13,58 --> 0:9:20,77
HE WAS FASCINATED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IN
SEPTEMBERﾊ2011.


77
0:9:20,77 --> 0:9:25,96
THERE IS ALSO ANOTHER TERRORIST GROUP BY THE
NAME OF ALSHABOB IN SMALL YOU.


78
0:9:25,96 --> 0:9:31,77
ONE OF THE TOP COMMANDERS IN THAT GROUP IS
A LOCAL SAN DIEGAN.


79
0:9:31,77 --> 0:9:37,75
HE STUDIED HERE, WENT THERE I BELIEVE IN 2005,
THAT'S WHAT FEDERAL OFFICIALS BELIEVE.


80
0:9:37,75 --> 0:9:45,9
AND THEN JUST AS RECENTLY AS FEBRUARY OF THIS
YEAR, A JURY IN SAN DIEGO CONVICTED FOUR MEN


81
0:9:45,9 --> 0:9:51,72
INCLUDING AN IMAM AT A LOCAL P MOSQUE IN CITY
HEIGHTS OF SENDING MONEY, CONSPIRING TO SEND


82
0:9:51,72 --> 0:9:56,86
MONEY AND PROVIDE OTHER MATERIAL SUPPORT TO
AL SHABOB IN SO SOMALIA.


83
0:9:56,86 --> 0:9:57,83
>> >>PEGGY: THANK YOU SE MUCH.
>> >>DWANE: NOW THE BOSTON MARATHON BOMBINGS


84
0:9:57,83 --> 0:10:2,15
CAST A SHADOW ON THE START OF DEBATE ON A
SWEEPING NEW IMMIGRATION BILL TODAY.


85
0:10:2,15 --> 0:10:4,17
A NUMBER OF REPUBLICANS USED THE EVENTS IN
BOSTON TO RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE EXISTING


86
0:10:4,17 --> 0:10:4,779
IMMIGRATION SYSTEM AND THE CHANGES PROPOSED
IN THE NEW BILL.


87
0:10:4,779 --> 0:10:5,75
THE ATTACKS WERE ALLEGEDLY CARRIED OUT BY
TWO BROTHERS OF A RUSSIAN REGION OF CHEF NU


88
0:10:5,75 --> 0:10:6,74
CHECHNYA.
WHEN THOUSANDS OF POLICE CONVERSED ON BOSTON


89
0:10:6,74 --> 0:10:6,74
TODAY T CAUSED THE CITY TO COME TO A COMPLETE
HALT.


90
0:10:6,74 --> 0:10:8,68
ON L PLAIJER BUS LINES WERE SUSPENDED ALONG
WITH AMTRAK SERVICE BETWEEN BAWS EXPN NEW


91
0:10:8,68 --> 0:10:10,65
YORK.
ONLY AIR TRAVEL FUNCTIONED NORMALLY.


92
0:10:10,65 --> 0:10:15,6
MOST HIGHWAYS REMAINED OPEN, WITH THE EXCEPTION
OF WATER TOWN WHERE THE MASSIVE SEARCH HAS


93
0:10:15,6 --> 0:10:18,92
BEEN CONDUCTED. THE BOSTON RED SOX AND BREW
NS GAMES WERE CANCELED.


94
0:10:18,92 --> 0:10:25,29
A MORE DETAILED PHOTO OF ONE OF THE SUSPECTS
IN THE BOSTON MARATHON SURFACED TODAY.


95
0:10:25,29 --> 0:10:29,84
HE'S THE ONE THEY'RE SEARCHING FOR NOW.
HIS PHOTO APPEARS TO CAPTURE ONE OF THE SUSPECTS


96
0:10:29,84 --> 0:10:32,46
ACTUALLY FLEEING WITH OTHER PEOPLE RIGHT AFTER
THE EXPLOSIONS.


97
0:10:32,46 --> 0:10:36,26
HE'S SEEN IN THE WHITE BASEBALL CAP AMAN WHO
TOOK THE PHOTO WAS LEAVING THE STORE WHEN


98
0:10:36,26 --> 0:10:37,88
THE BOMBS EXPLODED.
HOO GOT A QUICK PHOTO WITH THE IPHONE BUT


99
0:10:37,88 --> 0:10:41,15
DIDN'T NOTICE WHO IT WAS UNTIL YESER DAW.
SOCIAL MEDIA PROVED TO BE A POWERFUL TOOL


100
0:10:41,15 --> 0:10:43,1
FOR INVESTIGATORS HUNTING THE BOSTON BAWM
NING SUSPECTS.


101
0:10:43,1 --> 0:10:47,58
PEGGY PICO HAS MORE ON SAN DIEGO'S CONNECTION
TO THE HIGH TECH INVESTIGATION.


102
0:10:47,58 --> 0:10:51,89
>> >>PEGGY: HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PHOTOS
AND TWEETS FROM MARATHON SPECTATORS HELP UNDER


103
0:10:51,89 --> 0:10:57,31
VEST GATERS ZERO IN ON THE SUSPECT SAID.
KPBS REPORTER SUSAN MURPHY JOINS ME WITH HOW


104
0:10:57,31 --> 0:11:2,45
SAN DIEGO STATE'S VIZ CENTER AND HOMELAND
SECURITY SPHOONTS GOT INVOLVED.


105
0:11:2,45 --> 0:11:7,62
YOU'VE TALKED EXTENSIVELY THIS WEEK WITH ERIC
FROST AT THE VIZ CENTER.


106
0:11:7,62 --> 0:11:13,4
>> >>SUSAN: ERIC FROST IS CODIRECTOR OF SAN
DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY'S HOMELAND SECURITY


107
0:11:13,4 --> 0:11:20,1
PROGRAM, AND DIRECTOR O F THE VIZ CENTER.
HE GATHER MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF DATA FROM PHOTOS


108
0:11:20,1 --> 0:11:27,8
AND TWITTER, AND CREATES THESE VISUALIZATIONS,
IT'S TIEBL CAPTURE A SCENE SECOND BY SECOND,


109
0:11:27,8 --> 0:11:34,15
AND HE SAYS PEOPLE AT MONDAY'S MARATHON, THEY
ANALYZED THIS DATA AT LIGHTNING SPEED.


110
0:11:34,15 --> 0:11:38,83
HERE'S WHAT HE HAS TO SAY ABOUT IT.
>> >>: THERE WAS AN ENORMOUS EFFORT QUIETLY


111
0:11:38,83 --> 0:11:46,22
IN THE BACK END TO IDENTIFY PEOPLE AND TAKE
THEM OFF THE SUSPECT LIST.


112
0:11:46,22 --> 0:11:50,51
SO THAT WHEN THEY ACTUALLY HAD A PRESS CONFERENCE
OR WHEN THE FBI RELEASED THEM, IT WASN'T WE


113
0:11:50,51 --> 0:11:55,2
THINK THESE ARE, IT WAS LIKE THESE ARE THE
GUYS IT.


114
0:11:55,2 --> 0:11:58,22
AND IT WAS BECAUSE OF A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF
WORK IN THE BACKGROUND.


115
0:11:58,22 --> 0:12:3,66
>> >>PEGGY: NOW, HE WAS TALKING ABOUT GETTING
ALL OF THIS AND GETTING THIS INFORMATION,


116
0:12:3,66 --> 0:12:8,29
IS THAT WHAT WE REFER TO AS CROWD SOURCING?
>> >>SUSAN: CROWD SOURCING USED TO BE TIP


117
0:12:8,29 --> 0:12:14,74
LINES, THESE TELEVISION SHOWS THAT ASKED THE
PUBLIC TO SOLVE INVESTIGATIONS.


118
0:12:14,74 --> 0:12:20,68
SOCIAL MEDIA TAKES IT TO A NEW LEVEL.
ERIC FROST EXPLAINS.


119
0:12:20,68 --> 0:12:25,65
>> >>: HERE'S THIS MASS AMOUNT OF DATA COMES
IN, IT'S IN AN ORGANIZED WAY, AND IT'S ORGANIZED


120
0:12:25,65 --> 0:12:31,89
AND YOU CAN DO SOMETHING WITH IT.
AND SO A COMMON THOUGHT PATTERN IS IF YOU'RE


121
0:12:31,89 --> 0:12:35,61
CROWD SOURCING, SO LIKE IN A DISASTER, HAVE
OTHER PEOPLE TELL YOU WHAT'SER GOING O, YOU


122
0:12:35,61 --> 0:12:40,86
THEN KNOW WHAT'SER GOING ON, AND WHAT USUALLY
WORKS THE BEST IS SAY TO THE CROWD GIVING


123
0:12:40,86 --> 0:12:45,529
SOMETHING BACK THAT'S CALLED CROWD FEEDING.
>> >>PEGGY: HE'S TALKING ABOUT THIS CROWD


124
0:12:45,529 --> 0:12:49,46
FEEDING, THIS CROWD SOURCING, THIS BACK AND
FORTH CONVERSATION THAT'S NOT JUST SENDING


125
0:12:49,46 --> 0:12:52,36
IN A PICTURE.
BUT THERE'S SOME DRAW BACKS TO THAT SORT OF


126
0:12:52,36 --> 0:12:55,47
TWO WAY CONVERSATION.
>> >>SUSAN: YEAH, RUMORS CAN START.


127
0:12:55,47 --> 0:13:0,69
THERE WERE ABOUT EIGHT TO TEN PEOPLE WHO WERE
WRONGLY LABELED AS SUSPICIOUS.


128
0:13:0,69 --> 0:13:6,92
RUMORS CAN FLY RAPIDLY ON TWITTER.
WELL, MOST OF THEM WERE PHOTOS OF MEN WITH


129
0:13:6,92 --> 0:13:11,6
BACKPACKS OF COURSE, ANDﾊ
>> >>PEGGY: THEY WERE ACTUALLY THESE MEN WERE


130
0:13:11,6 --> 0:13:14,829
ACTUALLY PEOPLE WERE SENDING IN SAYING THESE
MIGHT TBHEE GUY, RIGHT?


131
0:13:14,829 --> 0:13:18,88
>> >>SUSAN: RIGHT SOME OF THEM WERE POSTED
ON MEDIA OUTLETS.


132
0:13:18,88 --> 0:13:22,92
THE POSITIVE THING IS THAT MOST OF THESE PEOPLE
WERE ABLE TO COME FORWARD AND CLEAR THEMSELVES


133
0:13:22,92 --> 0:13:26,3
WITH POLICE.
IT ALSO HELP UNDER VEST GATERS TO NARROW DOWN


134
0:13:26,3 --> 0:13:28,49
THE SUSPECT LIST.
>> >>PEGGY: ABSOLUTELY.


135
0:13:28,49 --> 0:13:31,24
SO IT CAN WORK BOTH WAYS.
IT CAN BE HARMFUL IF YOU'RE ONE OF THE RUMOR


136
0:13:31,24 --> 0:13:35,85
GUYS.
NOW THE BOSTON MARATHON, LIKE THE SAN DIEGO


137
0:13:35,85 --> 0:13:42,339
MARATHON OR ANY REALLY PUBLIC SPORTING EVENT
HAS BEEN KNOWN FOR QUITE AWHILE HAS AS A SOFT


138
0:13:42,339 --> 0:13:45,69
TARGET.
WHEN YOU WERE TALKING TO FROST, HE WAS ESPECIALLY


139
0:13:45,69 --> 0:13:51,2
CONCERNED ABOUT THIS, HOW COME?
>> >>SUSAN: HE FEARS THAT WE'VE ENTER UNDER


140
0:13:51,2 --> 0:13:56,16
TO A NEW ERA OF TERRORISM.
>> >>: PEOPLE GETTING IN OVER AND OVER.


141
0:13:56,16 --> 0:14:0,66
PEOPLE SEE THAT WORKED REALLY WELL, IT WAS
ON CAMERA, ALL THESE PEOPLE WERE LOOKING AT


142
0:14:0,66 --> 0:14:5,1
IT AND THIS HAD THE RIGHT EFFECT, SO I'M GOING
TO DO THE SAME THING.


143
0:14:5,1 --> 0:14:11,649
IT'S LIKE WHEN THE FIRST PEOPLE HIGH JACKED
AN AIRPLANE, OUR WORLD CHANGED AND FOR SPORTS


144
0:14:11,649 --> 0:14:15,68
EVENTS ABSOLUTELY SPORTS EVENTS ARE AN EXTRAORDINARY
TARGET.


145
0:14:15,68 --> 0:14:21,2
THE TEAMS ARE A TARGET BECAUSE THAT'S THE
MAJOR ASSET THAT THE TEAM HAS, AND HOW YOU


146
0:14:21,2 --> 0:14:24,279
PROTECT THOSE PEOPLE.
>> >>PEGGY: THESE SOFT TARGETS HE'S TALKING


147
0:14:24,279 --> 0:14:27,95
ABOUT HAVE BEEN KNOWN FOR SOME TIME, AND THERE
WERE GRAD STUDENTS YOU TALKED WITH AT THE


148
0:14:27,95 --> 0:14:31,46
VIZ CENTERS THAT ARE STUDYING SPORTS SECURITY
SPECIFICALLY.


149
0:14:31,46 --> 0:14:36,46
WHAT DID THEY HAVE TO SAY ABOUT WHAT THEY'VE
LEARNED FROM THIS BOSTON MARATHON SITUATION?


150
0:14:36,46 --> 0:14:39,93
>> >>SUSAN: THEY'VE LEARN AD LOT.
THEY'RE GOING TO BE GOING BACK AND DISUDYING,


151
0:14:39,93 --> 0:14:45,73
THEY'RE CONTINUING THE INVESTIGATION, COMPILING
EVIDENCE THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA, AND PHOTOS.


152
0:14:45,73 --> 0:14:50,71
THEY SAY THAT SOCIAL MEDIA IS THE BEST KIND
OF FORENSIC EVIDENCE BECAUSE EVERY PHOTO AND


153
0:14:50,71 --> 0:14:56,23
SOCIAL MEDIA ENTRY HAS A TIME STAMP AND A
LOCATE LOCATION AND THAT DATA IS INVALUABLE.


154
0:14:56,23 --> 0:15:2,43
>> >>PEGGY: YOU CAN SEE SUSAN MURPHY'S COMPLETE
REPORT ON OUR WEBSITE KPBS.ORG.


155
0:15:2,43 --> 0:15:4,339

NORTH COUNTY BUREAU CHIEF ALISON ST. JOHN
SAYS QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PLANT'S FUTURE ARE


173
0:16:38,589 --> 0:16:43,29
MORE COMPLEX.
>> >>ALISON: BILL HENMAN IS A NUCLEAR ENGINEER


174
0:16:43,29 --> 0:16:46,529
AND CONSULTANT.
HE'S ASSESSED RISK AT NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS


175
0:16:46,529 --> 0:16:49,66
AROUND THE COUNTRY.
I ASKED HIM IF IT WOULD BE COST EFFECTIVE


176
0:16:49,66 --> 0:16:55,149
TO BRING SAN ONOFRE BACK ONLINE.
>> >>: I THINK THE ANSWER IS YES.


177
0:16:55,149 --> 0:16:59,7
IF YOU LOOK AT THE HISTORY, THE PLANT HAS
DONE VERY WELL RK IT'S OPERATED ESSENTIALLY


178
0:16:59,7 --> 0:17:5,459
30 YEARS WITH NO REAL PROBLEMS LIKE THE BUN
THAT WE HAVE NOW.


179
0:17:5,459 --> 0:17:11,799
AND IT'S BEEN A REAL FRIEND TO PEOPLE IN SOUTHERN
CALIFORNIA BECAUSE IT'S KEPT OUR RATES LOW,


180
0:17:11,799 --> 0:17:15,289
BELIEVE IT OR NOT.
>> >>ALISON: HE SAYS IT WOULD BE WORTH SPENDING


181
0:17:15,289 --> 0:17:21,569
MONEY TO BRING IT BACK ONLINE BECAUSE MOST
OF THE CAPITAL EQUIPMENT COSTS ARE PAID OFF.


182

EVEN IF WE HAVE OO REPLACE THE ONES IN UNIT


183
0:17:26,23 --> 0:17:34,159
THREE WOULDN'T BEﾊ I DON'T THINK IS THAT
BAD BECAUSE THERE ARE ONLY 700ﾊMILLION,


184
0:17:34,159 --> 0:17:39,769
LET'S SAY.
WHEN YOU HAVE A MILLION OR MORE CUSTOMERS


185
0:17:39,769 --> 0:17:44,409
THAT ARE PAYING IN THAT AMOUNT CAN GET PAID
OFF RATHER QUICKLY.


186
0:17:44,409 --> 0:17:49,44
WE WILL BE ABLE TO GENERATE IT POWER TO COVER
THOSE COSTS.


187
0:17:49,44 --> 0:17:54,33
>> >>ALISON: WE'VE BEEN SO FOCUSED ON THE
FAILED STEAM GENERATORS AT SAN ONOFRE, BUT


188
0:17:54,33 --> 0:17:59,44
THERE ARE OTHER PROBLEMS THAT WILL COST MONEY,
PERHAPS A LOT OF MONEY, TO ADDRESS IN THE


189
0:17:59,44 --> 0:18:2,47
NOT SO DISTANT FUTURE.
>> >>: DO WE WANT TO GIVE THEM ANOTHER BILLION


190
0:18:2,47 --> 0:18:9,169
DOLLARS AND ANOTHER FIVE YEARS TO MAYBE OPERATE
FOR ANOTHER SEVEN YEARS WHEN OTHER COSTS ARE


191
0:18:9,169 --> 0:18:12,999
ON THE HORIZON.
>> >>ALISON: SHE SAYS CALIFORNIA RATE PAYERS


192
0:18:12,999 --> 0:18:18,19
NEED TO KNOW WHAT OTHER COSTS ARE AHEAD LIKE
COSTS TRIGGERED BY WHAT HAPPENED.

>> >>: IF YOU DRIVE INTO THIS LOVELY CAMP
GROUND, YOU NOTICE A SIGN THAT SAYS TSUNAMI

0:18:22,429 --> 0:18:30,269
ZONE, THERE ARE SIRENS FOR EMERGENCY PLANNING,
THE TRANSMISSION LINES AND ARE THEY SAFE DURING


195
0:18:30,269 --> 0:18:32,6
A SEISMIC EVENT.
>> >>ALISON: STUDIES OF EARTHQUAKE FAULT LINES


196
0:18:32,6 --> 0:18:38,36
ON THE COAST COULD REVEAL MAJOR RETRO FITS
ARE NEEDED AT SAN ONOFRE.

BECKER SAYS ANOTHER COST IS WHERE TO STORE
NUCLEAR WASTE.


198
0:18:43,379 --> 0:18:50,29
>> >>: THOUSANDS OF TONS OF RADIOACTIVE WASTE
SIT BEHIND ME ON OUR COAST.


199
0:18:50,29 --> 0:18:55,82
THE NRC HAS NO PLANS TO GELT IT OFF OUR COAST,
AND WE'VE BEEN PROMISED SINCE 1982 THAT IT


200
0:18:55,82 --> 0:19:1,289
WOULD BE REMOVED TO SOMEWHERE ELSE, SOME DAY.
>> >>ALISON: A THIRD UNRESOLVED ISSUE IS WHAT


201
0:19:1,289 --> 0:19:5,559
IT WILL COST TO REDESIGN THE PLANT'S COOLING
SYSTEM, PERHAPS WITH COOLING TOWERS TO MEET


202
0:19:5,559 --> 0:19:8,57
NEW CALIFORNIA REGULATIONS TO PROTECT MARINE
LIFE.

THIS PLANT, SUCKING IN SEA LIFE, LARVAE, TAKING


204
0:19:13,989 --> 0:19:20,869
OUT WARMER WATER.
THE ALTERNATIVES ARE REALLY VERY EXPENSE F,


205
0:19:20,869 --> 0:19:26,889
TECHNICALLY VERY CHALLENGING, AND COULD RESHAPE
THIS COAST LINE AGAIN.


206
0:19:26,889 --> 0:19:30,619
THEY'RE GOING TO ASK RATE PAYERS TO PAY, I
WANT TO KNOW WHAT IT'S GOING TO COST BEFORE


207
0:19:30,619 --> 0:19:35,509
THEY ASK ME TO PAY.
THIS PLANT BEHIND ME WAS DESIGNED IN 1967.


208
0:19:35,509 --> 0:19:41,909
MAYBE POURING A LOT OF MONEY INTO A NEW PLANT
WOULD HAVE MADE SENSE, NEW EMERGENCY PLANNING,


209
0:19:41,909 --> 0:19:50,22
NEW STEAM GENERATORS, NEW SEISMIC STUDIES,
BUT DOING THAT FOR A PLANT THAT WAS DESIGNED


210
0:19:50,22 --> 0:19:56,2
IN THE 1960S HOW MANY OF US ARE GOING TO DRIVE
A CAR, FIX EVERYTHING UP, AND SAY WE'RE GOING


211
0:19:56,2 --> 0:20:0,8
TO DRIVE IT ANOTHER 20 YEARS.
>> >>ALISON: BILL DOESN'T BUY THE OLD CAR


212
0:20:0,8 --> 0:20:5,669
ANALOGY.
>> >>: I DON'T SEE THAT AS A REAL DRAW BACK.


213
0:20:5,669 --> 0:20:11,269
I THINK I'VE SEEN SOME CLASSIC CARS THAT ARE
JUST BEAUTIFULLY RESTORED AND THEY'RE REALLY


214
0:20:11,269 --> 0:20:14,259
GREAT TO SEE ON THE ROAD.
>> >>ALISON: AND HE ISN'T WORRIED ABOUT AN


215
0:20:14,259 --> 0:20:17,509
ACCIDENT IN THE FUTURE.
>> >>: I THIK WE'RE AT THE EDGE OF THE 50


216
0:20:17,509 --> 0:20:22,889
MILE RADIUS RIGHT HERE.
WE'RE SITTING IN THE RANGE OF SOMETHING FROM


217
0:20:22,889 --> 0:20:25,639
THE PLANT RIGHT NOW.
I'M TOTALLY COMFORTABLE.


218
0:20:25,639 --> 0:20:35,359
FOR ME, THE TRADE OFF IN HAVING A SOLID, GOOD
ELECTRICAL SYSTEM IS FAR BETTER THAN, YOU


219
0:20:35,359 --> 0:20:42,58
KNOW, WORRYING ABOUT A SMALL RISK THAT WE
HAVEN'T EVER ENCOUNTERED BEFORE.


220
0:20:42,58 --> 0:20:48,45
>> >>ALISON: BECKER SAYS BEEFED UP EVACUATION
PLANNING MAY JEK GENERATE MORE COSTS, SHE


221
0:20:48,45 --> 0:20:55,33
BELIEVES TAX PAYERS LIABILITY IS UNDER ESTIMATED.
>> >>: THE FEDERAL LIABILITY LIMIT IS $12.6ﾊBILLIONS.


222
0:20:55,33 --> 0:21:1,429
WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED TO FUKOSHIMA,
THE DAMAGES PAYING OUT ARE OVER A HUNDRED


223
0:21:1,429 --> 0:21:6,9
50ﾊBILLION DOLLARS.
THAT WAS A SMALL FISHING VILLAGE IN JAPAN,


224
0:21:6,9 --> 0:21:9,249
THIS IS THE COAST OF CALIFORNIA.
>> >>ALISON: BECKER SAYS THE UTILITIES ARE


225
0:21:9,249 --> 0:21:13,639
NOT IGNORING ALL THESE ISSUES, BUT THE RATE
PAYER NEEDS TO KNOW HOW THESE PROBLEMS WILL


226
0:21:13,639 --> 0:21:18,21
BE RESOLVED AND WHAT THAT WILL COST.
>> >>: WE NEED TO CONSIDER THE ARGUMENTS AGAINST


227
0:21:18,21 --> 0:21:23,119
NUCLEAR POWER, THE ARGUMENTS FOR NUCLEAR POWER.
THESE ARE A SIDE ISSUE.


228
0:21:23,119 --> 0:21:28,519
WHAT WE REALLY WANT TO KNOW IS WHAT IS NUCLEAR
POWER GOING TO COST THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA,


229
0:21:28,519 --> 0:21:33,259
COST THE RATE PAYERS OF CALIFORNIA, IF OUR
LIVES AND OUR LIVELIHOODS ARE AT STAKE, AND


230
0:21:33,259 --> 0:21:35,72
WE NEED THE ANSWERS.
>> >>ALISON: SAN ONOFRE'S BEEN A SOURCE OF


231
0:21:35,72 --> 0:21:39,859
SAFE, RELIABLE ELECTRICITY FOR DECADES. THE
QUESTION OF WHETHER IT WOULD BE SAFE AND COST


232
0:21:39,859 --> 0:21:44,44
EFFECTIVE IN THE FUTURE IS MORE COMPLEX.
