1
0:0:3,541 --> 0:0:6,77
I'm going to talk about a very difficult subject.


2
0:0:6,77 --> 0:0:9,72
It's called "free will".


3
0:0:9,72 --> 0:0:12,737
Most people believe that they have free will.


4
0:0:12,737 --> 0:0:16,908
Strange thing about it... In the mechanical world


5
0:0:16,908 --> 0:0:20,69
when they say the machine turned off


6
0:0:20,69 --> 0:0:24,491
machines don't turn off. Either there's a short


7
0:0:24,491 --> 0:0:27,4
or something wrong with the circuit.


8
0:0:27,4 --> 0:0:30,441
Even automobile mechanics look for


9
0:0:30,441 --> 0:0:34,55
the factors that change the behavior of the automobile.


10
0:0:34,55 --> 0:0:38,768
Either the tires are not equally inflated


11
0:0:38,768 --> 0:0:42,877
they look for that, if your car veers to the right or left.


12
0:0:42,877 --> 0:0:46,561
Sometimes the tire pressure isn't even in your car.


13
0:0:46,561 --> 0:0:49,402
Sometimes a lawn mower doesn't cut the grass:


14
0:0:49,402 --> 0:0:51,708
The blades aren't sharp enough


15
0:0:51,708 --> 0:0:55,832
or the RPM isn't great enough, the rotational speed.


16
0:0:55,832 --> 0:0:59,66
So they always look for events


17
0:0:59,66 --> 0:1:4,88
that are responsible for the behavior of all mechanical systems.


18
0:1:4,88 --> 0:1:8,872
In fact, if you made a blade of a fan and had no pitch


19
0:1:8,872 --> 0:1:11,449
it would turn, but it wouldn't blow wind.


20
0:1:11,449 --> 0:1:15,83
So it's the pitch that blows the wind.


21
0:1:15,83 --> 0:1:20,783
And of course, the pitch moves the air rather than blows the wind.


22
0:1:20,783 --> 0:1:25,274
So, we all look for... Even a wind turbine


23
0:1:25,274 --> 0:1:30,936
is turned by the pitch, but wind has to act on it to do that.


24
0:1:30,936 --> 0:1:34,971
Now, moisture rises off the earth.


25
0:1:34,971 --> 0:1:40,794
We say the moisture is rising. Actually, the sun evaporates it.


26
0:1:40,794 --> 0:1:44,839
The sun lifts these little drops by heating them


27
0:1:44,839 --> 0:1:49,679
and they move up and back rapidly and they rise.


28
0:1:49,679 --> 0:1:52,449
Actually, they're caused to rise


29
0:1:52,449 --> 0:1:55,906
by the sun acting on the drops of water.


30
0:1:55,906 --> 0:1:59,837
We equate everything in nature. We never see...


31
0:1:59,837 --> 0:2:3,176
Well some of us do. We say "The tree fell over."


32
0:2:3,176 --> 0:2:7,701
The tree doesn't fall over, unless it happens that branches


33
0:2:7,701 --> 0:2:12,55
grow and change the center of gravity of the tree


34
0:2:12,55 --> 0:2:15,505
so it can no longer... The roots


35
0:2:15,505 --> 0:2:19,676
do not grasp enough surface to keep the tree upright.


36
0:2:19,676 --> 0:2:23,346
So the wind acting on the tree


37
0:2:23,346 --> 0:2:25,882
makes it fall to the ground.


38
0:2:25,882 --> 0:2:28,659
It isn't just the wind; it's gravity


39
0:2:28,659 --> 0:2:34,93
and asymmetry of balance which causes that.


40
0:2:34,93 --> 0:2:37,265
But human beings feel that


41
0:2:37,265 --> 0:2:42,574
they themselves have free will. They make choices.


42
0:2:42,574 --> 0:2:48,889
Free will means that all choices are made without cause.


43
0:2:48,889 --> 0:2:54,613
If something is caused by something else, it's not free will.


44
0:2:54,613 --> 0:2:58,62
In other words, hunger, when you get hungry


45
0:2:58,62 --> 0:3:1,514
the organism has used up a lot of energy


46
0:3:1,514 --> 0:3:4,188
and so you have different feelings.


47
0:3:4,188 --> 0:3:8,545
You have thirst. You have hunger. It's thirst


48
0:3:8,545 --> 0:3:11,66
that tends to make you want a glass of water.


49
0:3:11,66 --> 0:3:16,589
If you never had a feeling of thirst, you'd dry up; you would die.


50
0:3:16,589 --> 0:3:18,654
If you didn't have a sensor.


51
0:3:18,654 --> 0:3:22,69
If a fly landed on you, if you didn't feel the itch


52
0:3:22,69 --> 0:3:26,584
it would sting you continuously; so would a bee.


53
0:3:26,584 --> 0:3:29,29
But the fact that you have sensory things


54
0:3:29,29 --> 0:3:32,895
meaning responding mechanisms


55
0:3:32,895 --> 0:3:35,141
you'll whack the fly.


56
0:3:35,141 --> 0:3:38,561
So if all things in nature


57
0:3:38,561 --> 0:3:42,62
are subject to natural force


58
0:3:42,62 --> 0:3:45,559
including the orbit of the moon around the earth


59
0:3:45,559 --> 0:3:50,233
there's a gravitational field that keeps the moon within the orbit.


60
0:3:50,233 --> 0:3:52,464
The same [happens] with the earth.


61
0:3:52,464 --> 0:3:55,158
The same [happens] with the earth rotation


62
0:3:55,158 --> 0:3:57,962
[which] is done by physical force.


63
0:3:57,962 --> 0:4:1,344
[There is] something in nature that does that.


64
0:4:1,344 --> 0:4:5,391
A magnet really does not attract other material


65
0:4:5,391 --> 0:4:9,389
but there's some mechanism in the magnet


66
0:4:9,389 --> 0:4:12,355
that acts in a certain way.


67
0:4:12,355 --> 0:4:15,607
In other words, they found out years ago


68
0:4:15,607 --> 0:4:18,646
that if you suspend a ball with a string


69
0:4:18,646 --> 0:4:23,232
and you're in a precipice, it moves toward the precipice.


70
0:4:23,232 --> 0:4:27,511
Mass seems to attract mass, certain kinds of mass.


71
0:4:27,511 --> 0:4:30,466
So if you suspend a ball near a cliff


72
0:4:30,466 --> 0:4:33,707
it moves a little bit toward the cliff.


73
0:4:33,707 --> 0:4:36,542
Now, what that mechanism is


74
0:4:36,542 --> 0:4:40,821
I can go into theories about that, but I don't want to do that now


75
0:4:40,821 --> 0:4:44,54
because it won't serve any useful purpose.


76
0:4:44,54 --> 0:4:47,29
If an airplane is about to take off


77
0:4:47,29 --> 0:4:51,435
and there's a certain gust of wind, it'll take off faster.


78
0:4:51,435 --> 0:4:55,32
If it's about to come in for a landing and the wind moves


79
0:4:55,32 --> 0:4:58,243
at the speed the airplane is going, it'll drop to the ground:


80
0:4:58,243 --> 0:5:2,691
It needs wind coming at it to sustain it.


81
0:5:2,691 --> 0:5:7,21
Also, man does not see with his eyes.


82
0:5:7,21 --> 0:5:9,48
He needs light.


83
0:5:9,48 --> 0:5:11,857
If a man says "Well, at least I can see."


84
0:5:11,857 --> 0:5:15,789
If you bring him into a dark closet and tell him to see


85
0:5:15,789 --> 0:5:18,793
he cannot, unless there's light.


86
0:5:18,793 --> 0:5:23,93
So he does not see with his eyes. He sees with a combination


87
0:5:23,93 --> 0:5:26,858
of the retina, the brain, the eyes, and light


88
0:5:26,858 --> 0:5:30,673
and many other factors which I needn't go into.


89
0:5:30,673 --> 0:5:34,169
If all things are acted upon by nature


90
0:5:34,169 --> 0:5:38,413
if a moth has a tendency to fly into light


91
0:5:38,413 --> 0:5:42,297
and the moth has what we call an antenna.


92
0:5:42,297 --> 0:5:44,59
It's a heat sensor


93
0:5:44,59 --> 0:5:49,64
and when he gets near the flame, the heat sensor lets him know


94
0:5:49,64 --> 0:5:52,287
gives him a reaction away for the flame.


95
0:5:52,287 --> 0:5:57,157
So a moth without an antenna would fly into fire.


96
0:5:57,157 --> 0:6:0,79
It's the antenna that caused him to back off.


97
0:6:0,79 --> 0:6:3,627
If you put sensors on a machine


98
0:6:3,627 --> 0:6:8,113
meaning if they can sense the environment, they can react to it.


99
0:6:8,113 --> 0:6:12,3
Without sensors, a blind man needs a cane


100
0:6:12,3 --> 0:6:14,257
to see if there's objects in front of him


101
0:6:14,257 --> 0:6:17,538
because he doesn't have visual sensors.


102
0:6:17,538 --> 0:6:20,263
They say he tripped over the object.


103
0:6:20,263 --> 0:6:23,992
No, he had no sensors to tell him there was an object


104
0:6:23,992 --> 0:6:27,316
on the floor that he could not sense.


105
0:6:27,316 --> 0:6:31,153
So if a doctor knows that you have damaged sensors


106
0:6:31,153 --> 0:6:34,8
they recommend eyeglasses or eye surgery


107
0:6:34,8 --> 0:6:39,417
or retinal damage replacement or hearing aids.


108
0:6:39,417 --> 0:6:42,605
If you lose your hearing, you can't hear a Mack truck


109
0:6:42,605 --> 0:6:45,938
coming down the street. You'd have to step in front.


110
0:6:45,938 --> 0:6:49,387
If you can hear, at least you've got another sensor


111
0:6:49,387 --> 0:6:51,815
that tells you there's a vehicle coming.


112
0:6:51,815 --> 0:6:56,926
So people that are deaf, have a higher chance of being hit by a car


113
0:6:56,926 --> 0:7:0,399
not because they're deaf, but because they can't sense the car


114
0:7:0,399 --> 0:7:2,733
coming down the street.


115
0:7:2,733 --> 0:7:7,652
So, when we talk, they used to in the old days say we have six senses


116
0:7:7,652 --> 0:7:9,595
like we had six.


117
0:7:9,595 --> 0:7:13,374
We have an internal sense of how full you are.


118
0:7:13,374 --> 0:7:17,4
You have a pain sense of the depth of your body.


119
0:7:17,4 --> 0:7:21,102
You have an itch sense; you have a burn sense.


120
0:7:21,102 --> 0:7:24,224
You have many different senses, not six.


121
0:7:24,224 --> 0:7:29,19
You can say, we have six senses that I'm aware of


122
0:7:29,19 --> 0:7:32,613
but you can't say we have six senses.


123
0:7:32,613 --> 0:7:36,763
You have a sense of fullness, sometimes, a sense of fatigue


124
0:7:36,763 --> 0:7:39,545
which they don't talk about.


125
0:7:39,545 --> 0:7:42,86
So, don't try to [assess] numerically...


126
0:7:42,86 --> 0:7:46,6
unless you do a study of everything you react to


127
0:7:46,6 --> 0:7:49,541
and you say this a list of everything


128
0:7:49,541 --> 0:7:53,471
that I find, that man can react to.


129
0:7:53,471 --> 0:7:56,474
Some people, some, very few


130
0:7:56,474 --> 0:7:59,303
can sense magnetic fields.


131
0:7:59,303 --> 0:8:3,551
Some birds can't, if you put a magnet


132
0:8:3,551 --> 0:8:7,896
connect a magnet to their head, they lose sense of direction.


133
0:8:7,896 --> 0:8:9,992
The same with fish


134
0:8:9,992 --> 0:8:13,212
so fish have senses we don't have.


135
0:8:13,212 --> 0:8:16,15
I'm not talking about good, bad, right or wrong.


136
0:8:16,15 --> 0:8:19,798
I'm just talking about what you react with!


137
0:8:19,798 --> 0:8:23,649
So if a light gets continuously brighter and brighter


138
0:8:23,649 --> 0:8:25,748
your eyelids will come down.


139
0:8:25,748 --> 0:8:28,994
And if it gets so bright, you'll put your hand in front


140
0:8:28,994 --> 0:8:30,847
to diminish the light.


141
0:8:30,847 --> 0:8:33,489
They say "I put my hand there to diminish the light."


142
0:8:33,489 --> 0:8:37,938
Even if they couldn't speak, they'd do that. Do you know what I mean ?


143
0:8:37,938 --> 0:8:40,146
You don't have to be able to speak.


144
0:8:40,146 --> 0:8:44,293
So people think that they choose things.


145
0:8:44,293 --> 0:8:50,91
The proofs that they don't choose things are many, but I'll give some.


146
0:8:50,91 --> 0:8:52,96
If you're brought up in a tribe


147
0:8:52,96 --> 0:8:57,235
that looks very different than we do, you fall in love


148
0:8:57,235 --> 0:9:0,4
with that configuration.


149
0:9:0,4 --> 0:9:2,803
That's why when I say there's no such thing as beauty


150
0:9:2,803 --> 0:9:4,952
it's a condition thing.


151
0:9:4,952 --> 0:9:9,189
You're conditioned to like girls that are blond or redhead


152
0:9:9,189 --> 0:9:13,202
depending on the movies, books or people you've known.


153
0:9:13,202 --> 0:9:17,448
So, we don't always know what it is


154
0:9:17,448 --> 0:9:21,246
that makes us appear to choose.


155
0:9:21,246 --> 0:9:26,508
But if you met a person with yellow spots on their face


156
0:9:26,508 --> 0:9:29,977
and they always beat you up, every time you met a person


157
0:9:29,977 --> 0:9:32,988
with yellow spots, then the next time you saw a person


158
0:9:32,988 --> 0:9:36,28
with yellow spots you'd cross the street


159
0:9:36,28 --> 0:9:39,138
and they say "I'm avoiding the person with the yellow spots."


160
0:9:39,138 --> 0:9:42,629
No, that's called the conditioned reflex.


161
0:9:42,629 --> 0:9:45,616
You're conditioned to react to yellow spots.


162
0:9:45,616 --> 0:9:50,25
It doesn't mean that everybody with yellow spots will beat you up.


163
0:9:50,25 --> 0:9:56,854
We project, and maybe some of that projection is useful for survival.


164
0:9:56,854 --> 0:10:1,139
So if you eat a certain type of grass and you get a belly ache


165
0:10:1,139 --> 0:10:3,789
the next time you see that pattern


166
0:10:3,789 --> 0:10:7,5
you'll tell somebody else "Don't eat that"


167
0:10:7,5 --> 0:10:10,843
because all your decision-making is based upon experience.


168
0:10:10,843 --> 0:10:15,411
So if you touch a lot of poison oak, you get blisters on your hand


169
0:10:15,411 --> 0:10:17,858
and you don't know what it is that you touched


170
0:10:17,858 --> 0:10:20,869
you'd better make a record in the future of touching things


171
0:10:20,869 --> 0:10:24,498
and then looking in your hand, and then later when you get a reaction...


172
0:10:24,498 --> 0:10:29,768
Your decision-making system is affected by the rash you get.


173
0:10:29,768 --> 0:10:35,733
If you meet a redhead and she's very temperamental


174
0:10:35,733 --> 0:10:38,911
and you meet a second redhead and she's very temperamental


175
0:10:38,911 --> 0:10:41,689
you might tell your friends "Stay away from redheads!"


176
0:10:41,689 --> 0:10:47,15
They're temperamental." No, that's your reaction to particular redheads.


177
0:10:47,15 --> 0:10:50,654
If you meet a gay person, and they reach for you


178
0:10:50,654 --> 0:10:53,422
you push their hand and say "What is the matter with that person?"


179
0:10:53,422 --> 0:10:57,351
They've been conditioned differently than you have.


180
0:10:57,351 --> 0:11:0,142
It isn't that they're bad; nobody is bad.


181
0:11:0,142 --> 0:11:4,436
That's why society does not believe in free will.


182
0:11:4,436 --> 0:11:8,548
They say "Don't steal." When the kid steals you slap his hand


183
0:11:8,548 --> 0:11:12,965
if you catch him stealing. If you don't catch him, he can get away with it.


184
0:11:12,965 --> 0:11:16,89
So you tell kids... You give them a sense of morality


185
0:11:16,89 --> 0:11:21,263
a sense of behavior by spanking or pulling a dog.


186
0:11:21,263 --> 0:11:26,575
All dogs will try to do whatever they want to do


187
0:11:26,575 --> 0:11:28,534
so you connect a leash to him.


188
0:11:28,534 --> 0:11:31,833
When he tries to do his own thing you pull him away.


189
0:11:31,833 --> 0:11:35,549
So he always has to obey you.


190
0:11:35,549 --> 0:11:38,754
But if you let a dog alone, he'll take over.


191
0:11:38,754 --> 0:11:42,745
A dog will always try to get you to do things


192
0:11:42,745 --> 0:11:46,599
to satisfy it, unless you dominate the dog.


193
0:11:46,599 --> 0:11:50,675
The same with people. If a guy says to a small guy:


194
0:11:50,675 --> 0:11:54,94
"Go get me a glass of water," and the small guy doesn't, and he slaps him


195
0:11:54,94 --> 0:11:58,87
the next time he says "Get me a glass of water", the small guy will.


196
0:11:58,87 --> 0:12:3,224
But if he's a big guy, he picks him up and throws him across the room.


197
0:12:3,224 --> 0:12:6,207
He then says "I will get my own glass of water."


198
0:12:6,207 --> 0:12:9,141
That's based on conditioning.


199
0:12:9,141 --> 0:12:13,801
Free will is an arrogance on the part of man:


200
0:12:13,801 --> 0:12:18,6
the assumption that he is the only object in the world


201
0:12:18,6 --> 0:12:21,545
that does not react to certain stimuli.


202
0:12:21,545 --> 0:12:26,289
All decisions are based upon whatever reaction you had.


203
0:12:26,289 --> 0:12:29,609
If you like a young lady, you get married.


204
0:12:29,609 --> 0:12:32,418
In the old days you just moved in together


205
0:12:32,418 --> 0:12:35,788
but it was to difficult to manage.


206
0:12:35,788 --> 0:12:40,163
That is, a ruling group of people could not manage people


207
0:12:40,163 --> 0:12:42,553
unless they made a set of laws


208
0:12:42,553 --> 0:12:45,208
and said "You don't take anything out of his hut.


209
0:12:45,208 --> 0:12:47,441
You don't take anything out of her hut."


210
0:12:47,441 --> 0:12:50,536
They had to invent some kind of structure


211
0:12:50,536 --> 0:12:54,87
to keep that society working.


212
0:12:54,87 --> 0:12:57,422
In other words, if everybody took things from your log cabin


213
0:12:57,422 --> 0:13:1,564
and you went hunting and you got 5 rabbits and I stole 4 of them


214
0:13:1,564 --> 0:13:3,554
the tribe wouldn't work.


215
0:13:3,554 --> 0:13:6,466
So morality is an outgrowth


216
0:13:6,466 --> 0:13:11,11
of the inability to manage systems. Do you understand that?


217
0:13:11,11 --> 0:13:13,695
All moral laws come about


218
0:13:13,695 --> 0:13:15,728
because we need to have...


219
0:13:15,728 --> 0:13:19,44
especially if you get more than four people living together


220
0:13:19,44 --> 0:13:21,517
you have to make laws.


221
0:13:21,517 --> 0:13:26,112
The laws like "Don't take his bow and arrow. He made that bow and arrow."


222
0:13:26,112 --> 0:13:30,651
You give them all kinds of words "It is wrong, this is..."


223
0:13:30,651 --> 0:13:34,441
But if a guy doesn't have bow and arrow or a javelin


224
0:13:34,441 --> 0:13:38,514
and a lion comes at him, and your javelin is nearby


225
0:13:38,514 --> 0:13:40,796
he will borrow it.


226
0:13:40,796 --> 0:13:45,118
He doesn't steal it. He borrows it and he throws it at the lion


227
0:13:45,118 --> 0:13:49,48
because that's the only thing he knows that'll keep the lion off.


228
0:13:49,48 --> 0:13:52,424
He says "I decided to take your javelin


229
0:13:52,424 --> 0:13:54,531
although I know it's yours


230
0:13:54,531 --> 0:13:57,591
but there was nothing else I could do at the time."


231
0:13:57,591 --> 0:14:0,392
So the judge might be lenient.


232
0:14:0,392 --> 0:14:5,31
A lenient judge is a broad judge with broader experience.


233
0:14:5,31 --> 0:14:9,198
A judge is brought up to believe in right, wrong, good, bad


234
0:14:9,198 --> 0:14:13,64
black and white. His decisions are rigid as hell.


235
0:14:13,64 --> 0:14:17,94
But if you go to another country that has a different set of values


236
0:14:17,94 --> 0:14:19,531
and he learns to live there


237
0:14:19,531 --> 0:14:22,495
he can understand when you say:


238
0:14:22,495 --> 0:14:27,596
"Different cultures impose different values on people."


239
0:14:27,596 --> 0:14:32,687
They don't care if you were to take one grape


240
0:14:32,687 --> 0:14:36,224
from your grape collection, if you had a lot of grapes on the table.


241
0:14:36,224 --> 0:14:38,583
But if you only have one grape


242
0:14:38,583 --> 0:14:40,794
the law becomes severe.


243
0:14:40,794 --> 0:14:44,7
In scarcity there are more laws. Can you understand that?


244
0:14:44,7 --> 0:14:48,421
The scarcer the object: the more laws.


245
0:14:48,421 --> 0:14:51,601
Now if a man is incapacitated


246
0:14:51,601 --> 0:14:53,651
he has scarcity.


247
0:14:53,651 --> 0:14:57,185
So he looks at you, who can walk up and down and jump.


248
0:14:57,185 --> 0:14:59,628
He envies you


249
0:14:59,628 --> 0:15:3,185
because you have a wider range of behavior.


250
0:15:3,185 --> 0:15:7,293
But if he can be given a shot in the same range of behavior


251
0:15:7,293 --> 0:15:9,57
he no longer envies you.


252
0:15:9,57 --> 0:15:13,46
So envy is a by-product of behavior


253
0:15:13,46 --> 0:17:13,46
sometimes, that you cannot perform.
