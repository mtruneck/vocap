0:0:1,874 --> 0:0:5,648
Um-mm. I love the smell of pancakes
in the morning.


2
0:0:5,648 --> 0:0:6,849
Good morning, everybody.


3
0:0:6,849 --> 0:0:8,217
Hey, Nick.
Hey, Nick.


4
0:0:8,217 --> 0:0:11,653
Um, you know,
it's okay if you call me dad.


5
0:0:11,653 --> 0:0:13,154
I mean, your mother and I
got married


6
0:0:13,154 --> 0:0:14,322
so we could be a family:


7
0:0:14,322 --> 0:0:16,29
Mom, dad, son, daughter.


8
0:0:16,29 --> 0:0:17,591
I'm not saying
that you have to,


9
0:0:17,591 --> 0:0:22,346
but if you want to,
it's cool.


10
0:0:22,346 --> 0:0:24,857
Thanks, Nick.


11
0:0:24,857 --> 0:0:26,652
Uh...


12
0:0:26,652 --> 0:0:29,48
Your mother was supposed
to make me a special breakfast.


13
0:0:29,48 --> 0:0:30,692
Do you know
where it is?


14
0:0:30,692 --> 0:0:32,402
I think maybe we ate it.


15
0:0:32,402 --> 0:0:34,731
There's some cereal
if you want that.


16
0:0:34,731 --> 0:0:36,309
I love cereal.


17
0:0:36,309 --> 0:0:37,592
I don't want cereal.


18
0:0:37,592 --> 0:0:39,167
Why would you
eat my breakfast?


19
0:0:39,167 --> 0:0:40,948
We didn't know
you were coming down.


20
0:0:40,948 --> 0:0:43,62
Since when have
I stayed upstairs all day?


21
0:0:43,62 --> 0:0:46,388
There's always a first time.

How come?

Good morning, baby.

This was all
that was left.


35
0:1:17,452 --> 0:1:18,99
I made your breakfast.

0:1:18,99 --> 0:1:21,501
It's not here.


37
0:1:21,501 --> 0:1:22,605
Freeze.


38
0:1:22,605 --> 0:1:23,941
Where is it?


39
0:1:23,941 --> 0:1:25,278
Where is what?


40
0:1:25,278 --> 0:1:26,649
You want to play?


41
0:1:26,649 --> 0:1:28,189
Really?


42
0:1:28,189 --> 0:1:29,859
Kevin?


43
0:1:29,859 --> 0:1:45,34
In the freezer?


44
0:1:45,34 --> 0:1:46,61
I'm sick of this.


45
0:1:46,61 --> 0:1:49,485
Ooh, no, no, no.
Go, go, go.


46
0:1:49,485 --> 0:1:51,358
I can make you
another breakfast tomorrow,


47
0:1:51,358 --> 0:1:53,497
but I can't make
two more kids,


48
0:1:53,497 --> 0:1:54,898
at least
not by tomorrow morning.


49
0:1:54,898 --> 0:1:56,268
I'm not Octomom.


50
0:1:56,268 --> 0:1:58,307
If I made two new kids,
maybe they wouldn't hate me.


51
0:1:58,307 --> 0:2:0,579
Sweetheart,
they don't hate you.


52
0:2:0,579 --> 0:2:1,782
They love you.


53
0:2:1,782 --> 0:2:3,888
And freezing my food
is how they show it?


54
0:2:3,888 --> 0:2:5,159
Exactly.


55
0:2:5,159 --> 0:2:7,296
Well, what would they do
if they didn't love me?


56
0:2:7,296 --> 0:2:29,315
Poison your food
and then let you eat it.


57
0:2:29,315 --> 0:2:32,489
Why are you
looking at me like that?


58
0:2:32,489 --> 0:2:33,891
Can we talk
for a second?


59
0:2:33,891 --> 0:2:36,964
Nick Persons
wants to talk.


60
0:2:36,964 --> 0:2:39,737
This must be serious.


61
0:2:39,737 --> 0:2:42,41
Go ahead.


62
0:2:42,41 --> 0:2:43,645
You know I love you,
right?


63
0:2:43,645 --> 0:2:46,985
Yes.
What?


64
0:2:46,985 --> 0:2:49,457
Are you gonna be coming to bed
looking like this every night?


65
0:2:49,457 --> 0:2:51,228
What are you
trying to say?


66
0:2:51,228 --> 0:2:53,933
During the day,
you look like Halle Berry,


67
0:2:53,933 --> 0:2:56,939
but at bedtime,
you turn into Tyler Perry.


68
0:2:56,939 --> 0:3:0,179
Nick, we have been married
for six months,


69
0:3:0,179 --> 0:3:1,447
and you are acting like


70
0:3:1,447 --> 0:3:3,851
this is the first time
you've seen me like this.


71
0:3:3,851 --> 0:3:5,153
No, I'm acting like


72
0:3:5,153 --> 0:3:8,627
this is the sixth month
I've seen you like this.


73
0:3:8,627 --> 0:3:9,629
And what about you?


74
0:3:9,629 --> 0:3:11,98
How do you look
when you come to bed?


75
0:3:11,98 --> 0:3:13,336
This is not about me.


76
0:3:13,336 --> 0:3:16,7
Look, Suzanne,
I understand you're upset,


77
0:3:16,7 --> 0:3:17,109
but you need to know this.


78
0:3:17,109 --> 0:3:18,679
It's no different
than me telling you


79
0:3:18,679 --> 0:3:19,78
you have lettuce in your teeth.


80
0:3:19,78 --> 0:3:21,684
Oh, so now I got lettuce
in my teeth?


81
0:3:21,684 --> 0:3:23,254
No.
That's not what I meant.


82
0:3:23,254 --> 0:3:24,723
Oh, no.
I know what you mean.


83
0:3:24,723 --> 0:3:25,958
What you mean is,


84
0:3:25,958 --> 0:3:28,63
"you better look beautiful
all the time, or else."


85
0:3:28,63 --> 0:3:29,565
Well, you know what?


86
0:3:29,565 --> 0:3:31,34
The vows say
for better or for worse.


87
0:3:31,34 --> 0:3:32,637
In the daytime,
it's better.


88
0:3:32,637 --> 0:3:34,474
At nighttime,
it's worse.


89
0:3:34,474 --> 0:3:36,21
You can't have it
both ways.


90
0:3:36,21 --> 0:3:37,245
I'm sorry, okay?


91
0:3:37,245 --> 0:3:38,247
I'm just trying to be honest,


92
0:3:38,247 --> 0:3:40,25
like they tell you to do
on <i>Dr. Phil.</i>


93
0:3:40,25 --> 0:3:41,519
Oh, yeah?


94
0:3:41,519 --> 0:3:46,628
Well, how's that
working out for you?


95
0:3:46,628 --> 0:3:48,297
What's that?


96
0:3:48,297 --> 0:3:49,299
It's just a bill.


97
0:3:49,299 --> 0:3:50,868
They got your name wrong.


98
0:3:50,868 --> 0:3:52,738
It says
"Suzanne Kingston-Persons."


99
0:3:52,738 --> 0:3:54,307
You should call and fix it.


100
0:3:54,307 --> 0:3:55,776
Suzanne Kingston-Persons.


101
0:3:55,776 --> 0:3:57,546
I don't need to call.
That's right.


102
0:3:57,546 --> 0:4:0,45
Suzanne Kingston-Persons.


103
0:4:0,45 --> 0:4:1,886
What's with the hyphen?


104
0:4:1,886 --> 0:4:2,921
You're married now.


105
0:4:2,921 --> 0:4:3,956
It's my name.


106
0:4:3,956 --> 0:4:5,157
Hyphenated.


107
0:4:5,157 --> 0:4:7,595
A hyphen in your name
is a recipe for disaster.


108
0:4:7,595 --> 0:4:9,465
No, a recipe for disaster


109
0:4:9,465 --> 0:4:11,635
is telling your wife
she looks like Tyler Perry.


110
0:4:11,635 --> 0:4:13,871
A hyphen is just
a punctuation mark.


111
0:4:13,871 --> 0:4:15,905
A punctuation mark
that says,


112
0:4:15,905 --> 0:4:17,539
"I don't know
if this will work out,


113
0:4:17,539 --> 0:4:19,941
so I'm gonna keep
my old name just in case."


114
0:4:19,941 --> 0:4:22,409
Remember Rebecca Romijn?


115
0:4:22,409 --> 0:4:23,543
She married John Stamos.


116
0:4:23,543 --> 0:4:26,412
Then she became
Rebecca Romijn hyphen Stamos.


117
0:4:26,412 --> 0:4:27,413
Then what happened?


118
0:4:27,413 --> 0:4:28,915
Divorced.


119
0:4:28,915 --> 0:4:31,617
Well, Nick, my name
is part of my identity, okay?


120
0:4:31,617 --> 0:4:33,652
That's the name
I do business under.


121
0:4:33,652 --> 0:4:35,653
Puff daddy
turned into P. Diddy.


122
0:4:35,653 --> 0:4:36,988

0:4:36,988 --> 0:4:38,122
Huh?


124
0:4:38,122 --> 0:4:40,191
The rock turned into
Dwayne Johnson.


125
0:4:40,191 --> 0:4:44,694
Did people stop smelling
what he was cooking?


126
0:4:44,694 --> 0:4:47,497
If you want everybody
to have the same name so bad,


127
0:4:47,497 --> 0:4:48,497
change yours.

0:4:48,497 --> 0:4:56,371

Mmm.


157
0:6:0,403 --> 0:6:1,771
Did you get me
some more corn flakes?


158
0:6:1,771 --> 0:6:3,439
No.
Why?


159
0:6:3,439 --> 0:6:5,506
So just to be clear,


160
0:6:5,506 --> 0:6:8,142
you want me to do things
that make you happy,


161
0:6:8,142 --> 0:6:10,644
but you don't want to do things
that make me happy.


162
0:6:10,644 --> 0:6:14,147
Do you think it's easier for me
to get beautiful for you


163
0:6:14,147 --> 0:6:17,483
or easier for you
to get me a box of corn flakes?


164
0:6:17,483 --> 0:6:20,586
When did you
turn into the riddler?


165

Really think you should quit

Oh, he's not ahead.

0:6:23,821 --> 0:6:24,822

169
0:6:26,656 --> 0:6:28,24
It was a trial period.


170
0:6:28,24 --> 0:6:29,625
Didn't go well.


171
0:6:29,625 --> 0:6:31,994
You see that?


172
0:6:31,994 --> 0:6:35,13
Well, they need time
to adjust,


173
0:6:35,13 --> 0:6:36,665
and obviously,
so do you,


174
0:6:36,665 --> 0:6:39,501
because you don't do everything
you did six months ago either.


175
0:6:39,501 --> 0:6:41,136
Nick.


176
0:6:41,136 --> 0:6:49,362
Shave your legs,
maybe I would.

0:6:50,663 --> 0:6:53,332
Yo.
Who are you?

Hello, honey.

0:6:54,766 --> 0:7:0,937
Hey, ma.


181
0:7:0,937 --> 0:7:2,338
Ooh, don't speak.


182
0:7:2,338 --> 0:7:4,706
I heard everything
you had to say yesterday.


183
0:7:4,706 --> 0:7:10,576
Anything else
might ruin it.


184
0:7:10,576 --> 0:7:12,977
Mm.
Mm-mm.


185
0:7:12,977 --> 0:7:13,878
Who was that?


186
0:7:13,878 --> 0:7:15,98
Oh, that.
That was Orlando.


187
0:7:15,98 --> 0:7:17,647
We met in New York.


188
0:7:17,647 --> 0:7:18,748
Oh, I thought you said


189
0:7:18,748 --> 0:7:20,449
you was just
gonna hang out this weekend.


190
0:7:20,449 --> 0:7:22,951
I did, in New York.


191
0:7:22,951 --> 0:7:23,952
Oh, there you go.


192
0:7:23,952 --> 0:7:26,722
Thank you.


193
0:7:26,722 --> 0:7:29,459
He's kind of young,
isn't he?


194
0:7:29,459 --> 0:7:30,426
Now would be a good time


195
0:7:30,426 --> 0:7:31,993
for you to quit
asking questions,


196
0:7:31,993 --> 0:7:33,27
'cause if you keep talking,


197
0:7:33,27 --> 0:7:36,465
I will give you
the answer.


198
0:7:36,465 --> 0:7:37,834
What's wrong?


199
0:7:37,834 --> 0:7:39,136
Who said
something was wrong?


200
0:7:39,136 --> 0:7:40,137
I know my son,


201
0:7:40,137 --> 0:7:41,907
and you're acting funny.


202
0:7:41,907 --> 0:7:43,942
Something happen
with you and Suzanne?


203
0:7:43,942 --> 0:7:45,978
It's nothing.


204
0:7:45,978 --> 0:7:49,348
Suzanne wants to keep her name
and hyphenate it with mine.


205
0:7:49,348 --> 0:7:51,484
Suzanne Kingston-Persons.


206
0:7:51,484 --> 0:7:58,792
Hold that thought.


207
0:7:58,792 --> 0:7:59,993
Oh, hey, Suzanne.


208
0:7:59,993 --> 0:8:1,662
Are you at work?


209
0:8:1,662 --> 0:8:2,796
Oh, girl, I'm sorry.


210
0:8:2,796 --> 0:8:4,898
I must have called your number
by accident.


211
0:8:4,898 --> 0:8:8,168
Okay, bye.


212
0:8:8,168 --> 0:8:9,236
What was all that?


213
0:8:9,236 --> 0:8:10,504
Just had to make sure
she wasn't home


214
0:8:10,504 --> 0:8:12,304
before I started
talking about her.


215
0:8:12,304 --> 0:8:13,771
She's my wife.


216
0:8:13,771 --> 0:8:15,105
Start getting used to it.


217
0:8:15,105 --> 0:8:16,273
I started.


218
0:8:16,273 --> 0:8:18,172
Just not finished.


219
0:8:18,172 --> 0:8:20,374
And what is all this
hyphenated name stuff?


220
0:8:20,374 --> 0:8:22,508
You know, the least she could do
is be proud of the fact


221
0:8:22,508 --> 0:8:24,308
that you gave her
your last name,


222
0:8:24,308 --> 0:8:28,243
seeing as how you married her
and took in those...people.


223
0:8:28,243 --> 0:8:30,78
They're not people.


224
0:8:30,78 --> 0:8:32,314
They're kids.


225
0:8:32,314 --> 0:8:34,482
Anyway,
all I'm saying is,


226
0:8:34,482 --> 0:8:37,184
you don't see Michelle Obama
complaining.


227
0:8:37,184 --> 0:8:39,752
You know what her last name was
before she married Barack?


228
0:8:39,752 --> 0:8:41,254
No.


229
0:8:41,254 --> 0:8:42,322
That's right.


230
0:8:42,322 --> 0:8:45,824
Nobody knows,
and nobody cares.


231
0:8:45,824 --> 0:8:47,626
So what else did you do
in New York?


232
0:8:47,626 --> 0:8:49,226
Boy, I'm your mother.


233
0:8:49,226 --> 0:8:50,862
If you want to hear
about something nasty,


234
0:8:50,862 --> 0:8:57,536
go on the Internet
like everybody else.


235
0:8:57,536 --> 0:8:58,504
Thanks, mom.


236
0:8:58,504 --> 0:9:3,341
Mm-hmm.


237
0:9:3,341 --> 0:9:4,676
Uncle Terrence wants to know


238
0:9:4,676 --> 0:9:6,71
if we can spend the night
this weekend.


239
0:9:6,71 --> 0:9:9,178
He got tickets to a screening
of the new Will Smith movie.


240
0:9:9,178 --> 0:9:10,579
It's already made
$100 million,


241
0:9:10,579 --> 0:9:11,781
and it's not even out yet.


242
0:9:11,781 --> 0:9:13,49
Yeah.


243
0:9:13,49 --> 0:9:15,317
If it's fine with
miss Kingston hyphen Persons,


244
0:9:15,317 --> 0:9:16,585
it's fine with me.


245
0:9:16,585 --> 0:9:18,419
In that case,


246
0:9:18,419 --> 0:9:20,788
mom, can we have some
of Nick's money?


247
0:9:20,788 --> 0:9:21,756
Yes.


248
0:9:21,756 --> 0:9:25,559
Yes, you can.


249
0:9:25,559 --> 0:9:27,28
What?


250
0:9:27,28 --> 0:9:32,7
Kids need money.


251
0:9:32,7 --> 0:9:34,569
Thank you.


252
0:9:34,569 --> 0:9:35,937
Thanks.
Dad.


253
0:9:35,937 --> 0:9:43,409
Nick, can I talk to you
for a moment.


254
0:9:43,409 --> 0:9:45,911
Nick Persons, you should be
ashamed of yourself.


255
0:9:45,911 --> 0:9:47,245
You the one
that wants everybody


256
0:9:47,245 --> 0:9:48,647
to be clear
about their identity.


257
0:9:48,647 --> 0:9:49,68
It's just a name, Nick.


258
0:9:49,68 --> 0:9:51,14
What else do we need to do


259
0:9:51,14 --> 0:9:52,982
to make you feel like
you're a part of this family?


260
0:9:52,982 --> 0:9:54,816
How about treating me
like it?


261
0:9:54,816 --> 0:9:56,184
Just because you're here


262
0:9:56,184 --> 0:9:58,819
doesn't mean we have to forget
everything we ever did.


263
0:9:58,819 --> 0:10:3,23
We have a past.
Deal with it.


264
0:10:3,23 --> 0:10:3,991
Okay.


265
0:10:3,991 --> 0:10:17,614
Cool.


266
0:10:17,614 --> 0:10:19,683
Nick,


267
0:10:19,683 --> 0:10:21,151
what is all this?


268
0:10:21,151 --> 0:10:25,521
This is an autographed
pair of 1992 Air Jordans.


269
0:10:25,521 --> 0:10:27,823
And what is it doing
on my table?


270
0:10:27,823 --> 0:10:29,258
You not letting go
of your past,


271
0:10:29,258 --> 0:10:30,593
so I'm not letting go of mine.


272
0:10:30,593 --> 0:10:32,962
So I got all my stuff
out of storage.


273
0:10:32,962 --> 0:10:39,869
Deal with it.


274
0:10:39,869 --> 0:10:42,204
And who is this?


275
0:10:42,204 --> 0:10:44,372
Oh.
That is Renee.


276
0:10:44,372 --> 0:10:46,373
She was my girlfriend
for the first half of--


277
0:10:46,373 --> 0:10:47,541
I don't--


278
0:10:47,541 --> 0:10:50,71
I don't care
about your tramp ex-girlfriends.


279
0:10:50,71 --> 0:10:53,212
Okay?
I'm here. She's not.


280
0:10:53,212 --> 0:10:56,215
So obviously, I have something
that she doesn't.


281
0:10:56,215 --> 0:11:1,152
Yeah, two last names.


282
0:11:1,152 --> 0:11:2,86
You know what?


283
0:11:2,86 --> 0:11:3,354
Just 'cause
you rip up a photo


284
0:11:3,354 --> 0:11:6,656
doesn't make you right,
sweetheart.


285
0:11:6,656 --> 0:11:9,625
And you better not
try and put it back together.


286
0:11:9,625 --> 0:11:13,896
I'm just cleaning up.


287
0:11:13,896 --> 0:11:19,33
Knock, knock.


288
0:11:19,33 --> 0:11:23,7
Kevin, Lindsey,
front and center.


289
0:11:23,7 --> 0:11:24,873
Hey, Uncle Terrence.


290
0:11:24,873 --> 0:11:26,608
What the heck
is all this stuff?


291
0:11:26,608 --> 0:11:28,143
Mom and Nick
are having an argument.


292
0:11:28,143 --> 0:11:29,11
Yeah.


293
0:11:29,11 --> 0:11:30,278
Go wait in the car.


294
0:11:30,278 --> 0:11:31,178
Okay.


295
0:11:31,178 --> 0:11:32,714
And don't talk
to strangers.


296
0:11:32,714 --> 0:11:35,316
We're just
getting inside the car.


297
0:11:35,316 --> 0:11:37,151
Strangers could be anywhere,


298
0:11:37,151 --> 0:11:38,885
even in your own car.


299
0:11:38,885 --> 0:11:42,221
Okay.


300
0:11:42,221 --> 0:11:43,588
Hey, Nick.


301
0:11:43,588 --> 0:11:45,89
Hey, Terrence.
What's wrong?


302
0:11:45,89 --> 0:11:46,256
You tell me, man.


303
0:11:46,256 --> 0:11:48,191
What's going on
with you and my baby sister?


304
0:11:48,191 --> 0:11:49,492
We're having a fight,


305
0:11:49,492 --> 0:11:50,792
and it's not your business.


306
0:11:50,792 --> 0:11:51,993
Oh, I think it is.


307
0:11:51,993 --> 0:11:54,95
Look, I done seen her
go through one heartbreak,


308
0:11:54,95 --> 0:11:56,897
and I'm not about to stand here
and watch it happen again.


309
0:11:56,897 --> 0:11:58,165
What's that
supposed to mean?


310
0:11:58,165 --> 0:11:59,5
I tell you
what it mean.


311
0:11:59,5 --> 0:12:3,7
As the sole member
of an elite black ops unit,


312
0:12:3,7 --> 0:12:4,571
I got extensive training


313
0:12:4,571 --> 0:12:7,274
in defusing situations
just like this.


314
0:12:7,274 --> 0:12:9,142
I got a policy, bro.


315
0:12:9,142 --> 0:12:11,51
If I can't talk you down,


316
0:12:11,51 --> 0:12:13,279
I got to take you down.


317
0:12:13,279 --> 0:12:15,8
And it won't be pretty.


318
0:12:15,8 --> 0:12:18,416
Suzanne, Terrence
is threatening to kill me again.


319
0:12:18,416 --> 0:12:21,119
Terrence,
don't kill my husband.


320
0:12:21,119 --> 0:12:22,12
That's one.


321
0:12:22,12 --> 0:12:23,154
That's one?


322
0:12:23,154 --> 0:12:25,756
That's one what?


323
0:12:25,756 --> 0:12:28,191
What--what are you writing?


324
0:12:28,191 --> 0:12:31,46
What's that?


325
0:12:31,46 --> 0:12:39,636
Hate it when he does that.


326
0:12:39,636 --> 0:12:42,205
It's a shame that
a beautiful woman like you


327
0:12:42,205 --> 0:12:43,472
sitting here
all by herself--


328
0:12:43,472 --> 0:12:44,773
I am married
with two kids,


329
0:12:44,773 --> 0:12:46,642
and I do not look like this
in the morning.


330
0:12:46,642 --> 0:12:49,845
Good-bye.


331
0:12:49,845 --> 0:12:59,82
Good-bye.


332
0:12:59,82 --> 0:13:1,823
Oh, my God.


333
0:13:1,823 --> 0:13:5,26
Men get on my nerves.


334
0:13:5,26 --> 0:13:7,194
They think just because
they have a private plane


335
0:13:7,194 --> 0:13:8,295
and a house in Miami,


336
0:13:8,295 --> 0:13:10,13
you will fly off
on a moment's notice,


337
0:13:10,13 --> 0:13:12,64
like you don't have
anything else to do.


338
0:13:12,64 --> 0:13:13,665
Don't go, then.


339
0:13:13,665 --> 0:13:15,0
Are you crazy?


340
0:13:15,0 --> 0:13:16,702
What else do I have to do?


341
0:13:16,702 --> 0:13:18,57
Who is this,
Malcolm?


342
0:13:18,57 --> 0:13:19,638
Are you kidding?


343
0:13:19,638 --> 0:13:21,306
Malcolm can't afford
his own plane.


344
0:13:21,306 --> 0:13:22,573
That's why I dumped him.


345
0:13:22,573 --> 0:13:23,574
When?


346
0:13:23,574 --> 0:13:24,608
This morning.


347
0:13:24,608 --> 0:13:26,51
And you already have
a new boyfriend?


348
0:13:26,51 --> 0:13:27,51
Mm-hmm.


349
0:13:27,51 --> 0:13:28,911
And his name is...


350
0:13:28,911 --> 0:13:30,512
Angelo.


351
0:13:30,512 --> 0:13:31,513
Mm.


352
0:13:31,513 --> 0:13:32,813
And I told him,


353
0:13:32,813 --> 0:13:34,748
I just don't hop in a plane
with just any old body.


354
0:13:34,748 --> 0:13:35,75
I don't sleep around.


355
0:13:35,75 --> 0:13:37,219
I'm a one-man woman.


356
0:13:37,219 --> 0:13:38,487
You mean,


357
0:13:38,487 --> 0:13:41,19
"one man this morning,
one man this evening" woman.


358
0:13:41,19 --> 0:13:42,191
Suzanne,


359
0:13:42,191 --> 0:13:43,759
I would love
to be like you


360
0:13:43,759 --> 0:13:45,127
and find a wonderful man


361
0:13:45,127 --> 0:13:47,462
I can spend
the rest of my life with,


362
0:13:47,462 --> 0:13:49,96
but the fact of the matter is,


363
0:13:49,96 --> 0:13:51,398
men get on my nerves.


364
0:13:51,398 --> 0:13:52,666
Well, you're better off.


365
0:13:52,666 --> 0:13:54,34
You don't want
to be like me.


366
0:13:54,34 --> 0:13:55,502
Why?


367
0:13:55,502 --> 0:13:57,3
Trouble in paradise?


368
0:13:57,3 --> 0:13:58,304
Maybe.


369
0:13:58,304 --> 0:13:59,938
Nick's all bent out of shape


370
0:13:59,938 --> 0:14:2,241
because I want
to hyphenate my name.


371
0:14:2,241 --> 0:14:3,944
I'd like to say
it's not a problem,


372
0:14:3,944 --> 0:14:5,446
but it is.


373
0:14:5,446 --> 0:14:6,446
Mm-hmm.


374
0:14:6,446 --> 0:14:7,414
Well, you know what?


375
0:14:7,414 --> 0:14:8,882
Let me ask you
one question.


376
0:14:8,882 --> 0:14:9,849
What's that?


377
0:14:9,849 --> 0:14:10,95
Are you crazy?


378
0:14:10,95 --> 0:14:12,17
What?


379
0:14:12,17 --> 0:14:14,553
You are a woman...


380
0:14:14,553 --> 0:14:17,622
With two kids.


381
0:14:17,622 --> 0:14:19,824
Not only did you find a man;


382
0:14:19,824 --> 0:14:23,46
you found a good man
with a good job


383
0:14:23,46 --> 0:14:26,262
who loves you
and loves your kids.


384
0:14:26,262 --> 0:14:28,3
Oh, and he black.


385
0:14:28,3 --> 0:14:31,233
I mean, if the man wants you
to drop your name,


386
0:14:31,233 --> 0:14:32,334
drop it.


387
0:14:32,334 --> 0:14:39,306
You drop it
like the sponsors dropped Tiger.


388
0:14:39,306 --> 0:14:41,41
Well...


389
0:14:41,41 --> 0:14:42,209
Either you like
who you are


390
0:14:42,209 --> 0:14:43,71
or you like who you were.


391
0:14:43,71 --> 0:14:45,44
I can't be both?


392
0:14:45,44 --> 0:14:46,145
Michael Jackson couldn't,


393
0:14:46,145 --> 0:14:48,58
and neither can you.


394
0:14:48,58 --> 0:14:55,186
Mmm.
Mmm.


395
0:14:55,186 --> 0:15:0,324
You gonna finish that?


396
0:15:0,324 --> 0:15:2,725
Mmm.
Mmm.


397
0:15:2,725 --> 0:15:3,659
Mmm.


398
0:15:3,659 --> 0:15:7,395
Mmm.
Mmm.


399
0:15:7,395 --> 0:15:10,832
Whoo!


400
0:15:10,832 --> 0:15:11,999
Let's go.


401
0:15:11,999 --> 0:15:14,334
I got to make it to the airport
in 30 minutes.


402
0:15:14,334 --> 0:15:15,935
Well, who's gonna pay?


403
0:15:15,935 --> 0:15:16,836
Don't worry about it.


404
0:15:16,836 --> 0:15:18,671
I used to date the owner.
Come on.


405
0:15:18,671 --> 0:15:20,72
Well, we'll stop
at a gas station,


406
0:15:20,72 --> 0:15:26,76
'cause you gonna
have to pee.


407
0:15:26,76 --> 0:15:27,61
Man, she's hot.


408
0:15:27,61 --> 0:15:29,378
I can see why Suzanne
tore this up.


409
0:15:29,378 --> 0:15:31,614
Why would you bring this
back into the house, man?


410
0:15:31,614 --> 0:15:33,15
Everybody knows
pictures like this


411
0:15:33,15 --> 0:15:35,416
are why basements
and garages exist.


412
0:15:35,416 --> 0:15:37,786
I was trying
to prove a point.


413
0:15:37,786 --> 0:15:39,42
See, that's why
I avoid relationships.


414
0:15:39,42 --> 0:15:40,421
It's just too much.


415
0:15:40,421 --> 0:15:41,822
Who's right?
Who's wrong?


416
0:15:41,822 --> 0:15:43,157
Whose underwear is this?


417
0:15:43,157 --> 0:15:45,26
Just too complicated.


418
0:15:45,26 --> 0:15:46,794
What do you know
about it anyway?


419
0:15:46,794 --> 0:15:49,13
I mean, the longest you've ever
been with a woman is two weeks.


420
0:15:49,13 --> 0:15:50,665
How you supposed
to get to know a woman


421
0:15:50,665 --> 0:15:51,633
over ten working days?


422
0:15:51,633 --> 0:15:52,867
I don't.


423
0:15:52,867 --> 0:15:54,702
See, that's the difference
between you and me.


424
0:15:54,702 --> 0:15:55,903
I don't care
about who you are.


425
0:15:55,903 --> 0:15:57,404
I only care about
what we do together.


426
0:15:57,404 --> 0:15:59,539
Now, if you want to do
what I want to do,


427
0:15:59,539 --> 0:16:2,141
then we do
what we're gonna do.


428
0:16:2,141 --> 0:16:3,642
Do you?


429
0:16:3,642 --> 0:16:4,843
Hey, man,
hate me if you want.


430
0:16:4,843 --> 0:16:6,877
Who's the one of us
having problems?


431
0:16:6,877 --> 0:16:8,612
Do you think I'm wrong
about Suzanne?


432
0:16:8,612 --> 0:16:11,114
Who cares
what name she uses?


433
0:16:11,114 --> 0:16:14,65
Everybody knows Katie Holmes
is married to Tom Cruise.


434
0:16:14,65 --> 0:16:16,753
Okay, weird example.


435
0:16:16,753 --> 0:16:18,788
Everybody knows beyonce
is married to Jay-Z.


436
0:16:18,788 --> 0:16:21,557
In fact, I heard
he's hyphenating his last name.


437
0:16:21,557 --> 0:16:23,491
So now, if Jigga
doesn't have a problem with it,


438
0:16:23,491 --> 0:16:24,759
why should you?


439
0:16:24,759 --> 0:16:26,16
Yeah, I know.


440
0:16:26,16 --> 0:16:30,163
I'm allowed to say "Jigga,"
right?


441
0:16:30,163 --> 0:16:37,159
Oh, can I keep this?


442
0:16:37,159 --> 0:16:41,776
knock, knock.


443
0:16:41,776 --> 0:16:43,11
How was the movie?


444
0:16:43,11 --> 0:16:44,345
Movie was good.


445
0:16:44,345 --> 0:16:46,18
I like Will Smith.


446
0:16:46,18 --> 0:16:48,148
He funny.


447
0:16:48,148 --> 0:16:49,216
Hey, Nick.
Hey, Nick.


448
0:16:49,216 --> 0:16:50,25
Hey, guys.


449
0:16:50,25 --> 0:16:51,184
You wouldn't believe


450
0:16:51,184 --> 0:16:52,485
all the cool stuff
that happened.


451
0:16:52,485 --> 0:16:54,453
Uncle Terrence took us
on the rooftop of the mall


452
0:16:54,453 --> 0:16:55,787
and showed us where
a crazy gunman


453
0:16:55,787 --> 0:16:58,322
got taken out with a single shot
from a helicopter.


454
0:16:58,322 --> 0:16:59,49
Yep.


455
0:16:59,49 --> 0:17:2,258
When did this happen?


456
0:17:2,258 --> 0:17:4,994
A lot of things happen
that you don't hear about, Dick.


457
0:17:4,994 --> 0:17:7,429
It's because of people like me


458
0:17:7,429 --> 0:17:8,63
people like you


459
0:17:8,63 --> 0:17:11,333
don't know how dangerous
this world really is.


460
0:17:11,333 --> 0:17:12,901
Man, what are you
talking about?


461
0:17:12,901 --> 0:17:14,168
Look, man,
I don't have time,


462
0:17:14,168 --> 0:17:16,437
and I'm not interested
in explaining myself


463
0:17:16,437 --> 0:17:19,673
to somebody that sleeps
under the safety and comfort


464
0:17:19,673 --> 0:17:20,774
that I provide


465
0:17:20,774 --> 0:17:22,709
and then questions
how I provide it.


466
0:17:22,709 --> 0:17:24,144
Why don't you just say
"thank you"?


467
0:17:24,144 --> 0:17:25,412
And let's leave it at that.


468
0:17:25,412 --> 0:17:27,8
Hello, Big Brother.


469
0:17:27,8 --> 0:17:28,81
Hello.


470
0:17:28,81 --> 0:17:29,479
Why don't you guys
go upstairs?


471
0:17:29,479 --> 0:17:30,413
Bring your stuff.


472
0:17:30,413 --> 0:17:31,647
Okay, mom.
All right, mom.


473
0:17:31,647 --> 0:17:32,682
Hop to it.


474
0:17:32,682 --> 0:17:33,616
Bye, Uncle Terrence.


475
0:17:33,616 --> 0:17:35,951
Eat your vegetables.
We will.


476
0:17:35,951 --> 0:17:37,652
Moved all your stuff,
huh?


477
0:17:37,652 --> 0:17:39,854
Y'all patching things up?


478
0:17:39,854 --> 0:17:41,689
No, and stay out of it.


479
0:17:41,689 --> 0:17:43,19
I understand,
little sis.


480
0:17:43,19 --> 0:17:45,191
But if you need
to hide the body,


481
0:17:45,191 --> 0:17:47,26
just let me know.


482
0:17:47,26 --> 0:17:49,262
Yeah, he'll be in the bushes
with a vat of acid.


483
0:17:49,262 --> 0:17:50,763
You don't know that.


484
0:17:50,763 --> 0:17:52,632
I could be anywhere.


485
0:17:52,632 --> 0:17:53,599
I could be over there.


486
0:17:53,599 --> 0:17:57,804
Where?


487
0:17:57,804 --> 0:18:2,275
So is this your way
of saying you're sorry,


488
0:18:2,275 --> 0:18:4,944
you were stupid,
and I was right?


489
0:18:4,944 --> 0:18:6,411
Honey, I'm just trying


490
0:18:6,411 --> 0:18:8,513
to understand
where you coming from with this.


491
0:18:8,513 --> 0:18:10,148
You took back
everything else.


492
0:18:10,148 --> 0:18:12,515
What is your old sofa
still doing here?


493
0:18:12,515 --> 0:18:14,416
Honestly,
I hate our sofa.


494
0:18:14,416 --> 0:18:15,551
I put it in storage.


495
0:18:15,551 --> 0:18:17,119
Well, you better
bring it back out,


496
0:18:17,119 --> 0:18:18,386
'cause I'm not sitting there.


497
0:18:18,386 --> 0:18:20,788
Who knows what strange behinds
have been on that thing?


498
0:18:20,788 --> 0:18:25,192
I bought this sofa when
I started going out with you.


499
0:18:25,192 --> 0:18:26,259
So you never...


500
0:18:26,259 --> 0:18:31,264
Not on this.


501
0:18:31,264 --> 0:18:33,9
Mm.


502
0:18:33,9 --> 0:18:37,36
Nick, I know how important
this is to you,


503
0:18:37,36 --> 0:18:39,604
so if you want me
to change my name,


504
0:18:39,604 --> 0:18:41,572
I'm willing to do it.


505
0:18:41,572 --> 0:18:44,375
The reason I married you
is because I love who you are.


506
0:18:44,375 --> 0:18:46,244
If being
Suzanne Kingston-Persons


507
0:18:46,244 --> 0:18:47,246
makes you that woman,


508
0:18:47,246 --> 0:18:48,546
then I'm okay with that.


509
0:18:48,546 --> 0:18:50,81
Just tell me
what you think I should do.


510
0:18:50,81 --> 0:18:51,482
I want you to do
what you want to do.


511
0:18:51,482 --> 0:18:53,83
If you wanted me to do
what I wanted to do,


512
0:18:53,83 --> 0:18:55,118
we wouldn't have this problem
in the first place.


513
0:18:55,118 --> 0:18:56,319
You're an independent woman.


514
0:18:56,319 --> 0:18:57,587
Make up your independent mind.


515
0:18:57,587 --> 0:18:59,522
What kind of example
are you setting for the kids


516
0:18:59,522 --> 0:19:2,258
if you can't make a decision
on matters affecting our family?


517
0:19:2,258 --> 0:19:4,26
I tried to.
You wouldn't let me.


518
0:19:4,26 --> 0:19:5,194
Fine.
Keep your name.


519
0:19:5,194 --> 0:19:6,328
Don't tell me
what to do!


520
0:19:6,328 --> 0:19:8,364
Oh, forget it.


521
0:19:8,364 --> 0:19:10,199
I'll change mine.


522
0:19:10,199 --> 0:19:12,0
What?


523
0:19:12,0 --> 0:19:13,134
You heard me.


524
0:19:13,134 --> 0:19:15,17
I'll change my name.


525
0:19:15,17 --> 0:19:17,673
Nick Kingston-Persons.


526
0:19:17,673 --> 0:19:20,41
Is that okay with you?


527
0:19:20,41 --> 0:19:24,744
Yes.


528
0:19:24,744 --> 0:19:26,11
I'm gonna go get ready
for bed.


529
0:19:26,11 --> 0:19:28,18
No, no,
don't change.


530
0:19:28,18 --> 0:19:30,15
Keep that on.


531
0:19:30,15 --> 0:19:37,87
For me, please?


532
0:19:37,87 --> 0:19:38,121
My eyes!


533
0:19:38,121 --> 0:19:39,989
Turn it off!


534
0:19:39,989 --> 0:19:42,57
What is wrong with you, man?


535
0:19:42,57 --> 0:19:43,592
What in the world
are you two dog?


536
0:19:43,592 --> 0:19:45,895
Uncle Terrence gave us
these new night vision goggles.


537
0:19:45,895 --> 0:19:48,63
We're trying them out.


538
0:19:48,63 --> 0:19:49,897
You got another pair?


539
0:19:49,897 --> 0:19:51,899
Sure.


540
0:19:51,899 --> 0:20:0,439
Here.


541
0:20:0,439 --> 0:20:7,11
Let me talk to you guys
for a second.


542
0:20:7,11 --> 0:20:8,946
If it's okay with you guys,


543
0:20:8,946 --> 0:20:12,482
I'm gonna be Nick
Kingston-Persons from now on.


544
0:20:12,482 --> 0:20:14,184
Did Uncle Terrence
threaten you again?


545
0:20:14,184 --> 0:20:15,351
Yeah.


546
0:20:15,351 --> 0:20:16,919
But it's because I love you.


547
0:20:16,919 --> 0:20:20,722
I want us to be a family
with one name.


548
0:20:20,722 --> 0:20:21,856
You mean two names.


549
0:20:21,856 --> 0:20:23,191
The same name.


550
0:20:23,191 --> 0:20:26,27
Lindsey Kingston-Persons.


551
0:20:26,27 --> 0:20:27,261
I like it.


552
0:20:27,261 --> 0:20:28,495
Good.


553
0:20:28,495 --> 0:20:31,131
So will it still bother you
if we call you Nick?


554
0:20:31,131 --> 0:20:32,132
No.


555
0:20:32,132 --> 0:20:33,234
Do you have any suggestions


556
0:20:33,234 --> 0:20:35,602
for anything else
that would bother you?


557
0:20:35,602 --> 0:20:37,237
I'll see you in the morning.


558
0:20:37,237 --> 0:20:38,47
I love you guys.


559
0:20:38,47 --> 0:20:39,805
Good night.


560
0:20:39,805 --> 0:20:52,549
Good night.


561
0:20:52,549 --> 0:20:53,918
Oh, my God.


562
0:20:53,918 --> 0:20:56,862
What is wrong with you, man?


563
