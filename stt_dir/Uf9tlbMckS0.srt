0:0:13,64 --> 0:0:16,488
Professor Paul Bloom:
This class today is about


2
0:0:16,488 --> 0:0:18,785
language.
And language is,


3
0:0:18,785 --> 0:0:23,5
to a large extent,
where the action is.


4
0:0:23,5 --> 0:0:26,494
The study of human language has
been the battleground over


5
0:0:26,494 --> 0:0:28,73
different theories of human
nature.


6
0:0:28,73 --> 0:0:32,148
So, every philosopher or
psychologist or humanist or


7
0:0:32,148 --> 0:0:36,36
neuroscientist who has ever
thought about people has had to


8
0:0:36,36 --> 0:0:40,46
make some claim about the nature
of language and how it works.


9
0:0:40,46 --> 0:0:43,785
I'm including here people like
Aristotle and Plato,


10
0:0:43,785 --> 0:0:45,98
Hume, Locke,
Freud and Skinner.


11
0:0:45,98 --> 0:0:49,686
I'm also including modern-day
approaches to computational


12
0:0:49,686 --> 0:0:53,261
theory, cognitive neuroscience,
evolutionary theory and


13
0:0:53,261 --> 0:0:56,894
cultural psychology.
If you hope to make it with a


14
0:0:56,894 --> 0:1:0,66
theory of what people are and
how people work,


15
0:1:0,66 --> 0:1:3,38
you have to explain and talk
about language.


16
0:1:3,38 --> 0:1:6,501
In fact, language is
sufficiently interesting that,


17
0:1:6,501 --> 0:1:10,6
unlike most other things I'll
talk about in this class,


18
0:1:10,6 --> 0:1:13,209
there is an entire field
devoted to its study,


19
0:1:13,209 --> 0:1:17,409
the field of linguistics that
is entirely devoted to studying


20
0:1:17,409 --> 0:1:21,189
the nuances and structures of
different languages.


21
0:1:21,189 --> 0:1:23,897
Now, I'll first,
before getting into details,


22
0:1:23,897 --> 0:1:27,867
make a definitional point.
When I'm talking about language


23
0:1:27,867 --> 0:1:32,72
I'm meaning systems like English
and Dutch and Warlpiri and


24
0:1:32,72 --> 0:1:36,64
Italian and Turkish and Urdu and
what we've seen and heard right


25
0:1:36,64 --> 0:1:40,265
now in class in the
demonstration that preceded the


26
0:1:40,265 --> 0:1:44,694
formal lecture.
Now, you could use language in


27
0:1:44,694 --> 0:1:47,869
a different sense.
You could use the term


28
0:1:47,869 --> 0:1:51,567
"language" to describe what dogs
do, or what chimpanzees do,


29
0:1:51,567 --> 0:1:53,924
or birds.
You could use language to


30
0:1:53,924 --> 0:1:56,49
describe music,
talk about the--a musical


31
0:1:56,49 --> 0:1:59,424
language or art,
or any communicative system,


32
0:1:59,424 --> 0:2:2,239
and there's actually nothing
wrong with that.


33
0:2:2,239 --> 0:2:5,121
There's no rule about how
you're supposed to use the word


34
0:2:5,121 --> 0:2:7,504
"language."
But the problem is if you use


35
0:2:7,504 --> 0:2:10,58
the word "language" impossibly,
incredibly broadly,


36
0:2:10,58 --> 0:2:14,129
then from a scientific point of
view it becomes useless to ask


37
0:2:14,129 --> 0:2:17,896
interesting questions about it.
If language can refer to just


38
0:2:17,896 --> 0:2:21,8
about everything from English to
traffic signals,


39
0:2:21,8 --> 0:2:23,715
then we're not going to be able
to find interesting


40
0:2:23,715 --> 0:2:26,139
generalizations or do good
science about it.


41
0:2:26,139 --> 0:2:28,51
So, what I want to do is,
I want to discuss the


42
0:2:28,51 --> 0:2:32,718
scientific notion of language,
at first restricting myself to


43
0:2:32,718 --> 0:2:37,834
systems like English and Dutch
and American sign language and


44
0:2:37,834 --> 0:2:40,794
Navajo and so on.
Once we've made some


45
0:2:40,794 --> 0:2:43,992
generalizations about language
in this narrow sense,


46
0:2:43,992 --> 0:2:46,534
we could then ask,
and we will ask,


47
0:2:46,534 --> 0:2:51,49
to what extent do other systems
such as animal communication


48
0:2:51,49 --> 0:2:54,569
systems relate to this narrower
definition.


49
0:2:54,569 --> 0:2:56,509
So we could ask,
in this narrow sense,


50
0:2:56,509 --> 0:2:59,55
what properties do languages
have and then go on to ask,


51
0:2:59,55 --> 0:3:1,891
in a broader sense,
what other communicative


52
0:3:1,891 --> 0:3:4,69
systems also possess those
properties.


53
0:3:4,69 --> 0:3:9,819
Well, some things are obvious
about language so here are some;


54
0:3:9,819 --> 0:3:11,25
here are the questions we will
ask.


55
0:3:11,25 --> 0:3:13,159
This will frame our discussion
today.


56
0:3:13,159 --> 0:3:15,75
We'll first go over some basic
facts about language.


57
0:3:15,75 --> 0:3:18,89
We'll talk about what languages
share, we'll talk about how


58
0:3:18,89 --> 0:3:21,435
language develops,
and we'll talk about language


59
0:3:21,435 --> 0:3:25,639
and communication in nonhumans.
I began this class with a


60
0:3:25,639 --> 0:3:30,442
demonstration of--that
illustrates two very important


61
0:3:30,442 --> 0:3:35,834
facts about language.
One is that languages all share


62
0:3:35,834 --> 0:3:39,52
some deep and intricate
universals.


63
0:3:39,52 --> 0:3:41,319
In particular,
all languages,


64
0:3:41,319 --> 0:3:45,11
at minimum, are powerful enough
to convey an abstract notion


65
0:3:45,11 --> 0:3:47,992
like this;
abstract in the sense that it


66
0:3:47,992 --> 0:3:51,821
talks about thoughts and it
talks about a proposition and


67
0:3:51,821 --> 0:3:55,754
spatial relations in objects.
There's no language in the


68
0:3:55,754 --> 0:3:59,78
world that you just cannot talk
about abstract things with.


69
0:3:59,78 --> 0:4:2,921
Every language can do this.
But the demonstration also


70
0:4:2,921 --> 0:4:6,381
illustrated another fact about
language, which is how different


71
0:4:6,381 --> 0:4:8,56
languages are.
They sound different.


72
0:4:8,56 --> 0:4:11,829
If you know one language,
you don't necessarily know


73
0:4:11,829 --> 0:4:14,569
another.
It's not merely that you can't


74
0:4:14,569 --> 0:4:17,762
understand it.
It could sound strange or look


75
0:4:17,762 --> 0:4:20,62
unusual in the case of a sign
language.


76
0:4:20,62 --> 0:4:25,548
And so, any adequate theory of
language has to allow for both


77
0:4:25,548 --> 0:4:30,23
the commonalities and the
differences across languages.


78
0:4:30,23 --> 0:4:33,937
And this is the puzzle faced by
the psychology and cognitive


79
0:4:33,937 --> 0:4:37,82
science of language.
Well, let's start with an


80
0:4:37,82 --> 0:4:41,1
interesting claim about language
made by Charles Darwin.


81
0:4:41,1 --> 0:4:43,97
So, Darwin writes,
"Man has an instinctive


82
0:4:43,97 --> 0:4:47,329
tendency to speak,
as we see in the babble of our


83
0:4:47,329 --> 0:4:50,277
young children,
while no child has an


84
0:4:50,277 --> 0:4:53,819
instinctive tendency to bake,
brew or write."


85
0:4:53,819 --> 0:4:57,14
And what Darwin is claiming
here, and it's a controversial


86
0:4:57,14 --> 0:5:0,742
and interesting claim,
is that language is special in


87
0:5:0,742 --> 0:5:4,714
that there's some sort of
propensity or capacity or


88
0:5:4,714 --> 0:5:9,48
instinct for language unlike the
other examples he gives.


89
0:5:9,48 --> 0:5:13,132
Not everything comes natural to
us but Darwin suggests that


90
0:5:13,132 --> 0:5:15,645
language does.
Well, why should we believe


91
0:5:15,645 --> 0:5:18,695
this?
Well, there are some basic


92
0:5:18,695 --> 0:5:22,35
facts that support Darwin's
claim.


93
0:5:22,35 --> 0:5:25,778
For one thing,
every normal--every human


94
0:5:25,778 --> 0:5:29,591
society has language.
In the course of traveling,


95
0:5:29,591 --> 0:5:32,711
cultures encounter other
cultures and they often


96
0:5:32,711 --> 0:5:36,759
encounter cultures that are very
different from their own.


97
0:5:36,759 --> 0:5:39,83
But through the course of human
history, nobody has ever


98
0:5:39,83 --> 0:5:42,844
encountered another group of
humans that did not have a


99
0:5:42,844 --> 0:5:45,678
language.
Does this show that it's built


100
0:5:45,678 --> 0:5:48,3
in?
Well, not necessarily.


101
0:5:48,3 --> 0:5:51,11
It could be a cultural
innovation.


102
0:5:51,11 --> 0:5:52,853
It could be,
for instance,


103
0:5:52,853 --> 0:5:56,828
that language is such a good
idea that every culture comes


104
0:5:56,828 --> 0:6:1,1
across it and develops it.
Just about every culture uses


105
0:6:1,1 --> 0:6:5,191
some sort of utensils to eat
food with, a knife and a fork,


106
0:6:5,191 --> 0:6:9,163
chopsticks, a spoon.
This probably is not because


107
0:6:9,163 --> 0:6:13,459
use of eating utensils is human
nature, but rather,


108
0:6:13,459 --> 0:6:16,932
it's because it's just a very
useful thing that cultures


109
0:6:16,932 --> 0:6:20,563
discover over and over again.
Well, we know that this


110
0:6:20,563 --> 0:6:23,91
probably is not true with regard
to language.


111
0:6:23,91 --> 0:6:29,973
And one reason we know this is
because of the demonstrated case


112
0:6:29,973 --> 0:6:34,863
studies where a language is
created within a single


113
0:6:34,863 --> 0:6:38,889
generation.
And these case studies have


114
0:6:38,889 --> 0:6:43,846
happened over history.
The standard example is people


115
0:6:43,846 --> 0:6:48,71
involved in the slave trade.
The slave trade revolving


116
0:6:48,71 --> 0:6:51,524
around tobacco or cotton or
coffee or sugar would tend to


117
0:6:51,524 --> 0:6:55,41
mix slaves and laborers from
different language backgrounds,


118
0:6:55,41 --> 0:6:59,182
in part deliberately,
so as to avoid the possibility


119
0:6:59,182 --> 0:7:1,462
of revolt.
What would happen is these


120
0:7:1,462 --> 0:7:4,73
people who were enslaved from
different cultures would develop


121
0:7:4,73 --> 0:7:7,783
a makeshift communication system
so they could talk to one


122
0:7:7,783 --> 0:7:11,219
another.
And this is called a "pidgin,"


123
0:7:11,219 --> 0:7:15,468
p-i-d-g-i-n, a pidgin.
And this pidgin was how they


124
0:7:15,468 --> 0:7:17,961
would talk.
And this pidgin was not a


125
0:7:17,961 --> 0:7:19,854
language.
It was strings of words


126
0:7:19,854 --> 0:7:22,931
borrowed from the different
languages around them and put


127
0:7:22,931 --> 0:7:25,19
together in sort of haphazard
ways.


128
0:7:25,19 --> 0:7:29,233
The question is what happens to
the children who are raised in


129
0:7:29,233 --> 0:7:32,432
this society.
And you might expect it that


130
0:7:32,432 --> 0:7:36,37
they would come to speak a
pidgin, but they don't.


131
0:7:36,37 --> 0:7:39,131
What happens is,
in the course of a single


132
0:7:39,131 --> 0:7:42,23
generation, they develop their
own language.


133
0:7:42,23 --> 0:7:46,96
They create a language with
rich syntax and morphology and


134
0:7:46,96 --> 0:7:50,29
phonology, terms that we'll
understand in a few minutes.


135
0:7:50,29 --> 0:7:54,74
And this language that they
create is called a "creole."


136
0:7:54,74 --> 0:7:59,26
And languages that we know now
as creoles, the word refers back


137
0:7:59,26 --> 0:8:1,998
to their history.
That means that they were


138
0:8:1,998 --> 0:8:5,441
developed from pidgins.
And this is interesting because


139
0:8:5,441 --> 0:8:8,725
this suggests that to some
extent the ability to use and


140
0:8:8,725 --> 0:8:12,129
understand and learn language is
part of human nature.


141
0:8:12,129 --> 0:8:14,43
It doesn't require an extensive
cultural history.


142
0:8:14,43 --> 0:8:18,404
Rather, just about any normal
child, even when not exposed to


143
0:8:18,404 --> 0:8:21,649
a full-fledged language,
can create a language.


144
0:8:21,649 --> 0:8:25,13
And more recently,
there's been case studies of


145
0:8:25,13 --> 0:8:27,93
children who acquire sign
language.


146
0:8:27,93 --> 0:8:31,995
There's a wonderful case in
Nicaragua in sign language where


147
0:8:31,995 --> 0:8:36,13
they acquire sign language from
adults who themselves are not


148
0:8:36,13 --> 0:8:39,77
versed in sign language.
They're sort of second-language


149
0:8:39,77 --> 0:8:42,638
learners struggling along.
What you might have expected


150
0:8:42,638 --> 0:8:45,788
would be the children would then
use whatever system their adults


151
0:8:45,788 --> 0:8:48,409
use, but they don't.
They "creolized" it.


152
0:8:48,409 --> 0:8:51,11
They take this makeshift
communication system developed


153
0:8:51,11 --> 0:8:52,259
by adults and,
again,


154
0:8:52,259 --> 0:8:56,667
they turn it into a full-blown
language, suggesting that to


155
0:8:56,667 --> 0:9:0,466
some extent it's part of our
human nature to create


156
0:9:0,466 --> 0:9:6,46
languages.
Also, every normal human has


157
0:9:6,46 --> 0:9:9,577
language.
Not everybody in this room can


158
0:9:9,577 --> 0:9:12,421
ride a bicycle.
Not everybody in this room can


159
0:9:12,421 --> 0:9:15,744
play chess.
But everybody possesses at


160
0:9:15,744 --> 0:9:19,173
least one language.
And everybody started to


161
0:9:19,173 --> 0:9:22,399
possess at least one language
when they were a child.


162
0:9:22,399 --> 0:9:26,241
There are exceptions,
but the exceptions come about


163
0:9:26,241 --> 0:9:28,929
due to some sort of brain
damage.


164
0:9:28,929 --> 0:9:33,9
Any neurologically normal human
will come to possess a language.


165
0:9:33,9 --> 0:9:38,677
What else do we know?
Well, the claim that language


166
0:9:38,677 --> 0:9:42,611
is part of human nature is
supported by neurological


167
0:9:42,611 --> 0:9:45,347
studies,
some of which were referred to


168
0:9:45,347 --> 0:9:49,61
in the chapters on the brain
that you read earlier that talk


169
0:9:49,61 --> 0:9:52,899
about dedicated parts of the
brain that work for language.


170
0:9:52,899 --> 0:9:56,399
And if parts of these
brains--if parts--if these parts


171
0:9:56,399 --> 0:10:0,427
of the brain are damaged you get
language deficits or aphasias


172
0:10:0,427 --> 0:10:4,59
where you might lose the ability
to understand or create


173
0:10:4,59 --> 0:10:6,701
language.
More speculatively,


174
0:10:6,701 --> 0:10:11,744
there has been some fairly
recent work studying the genetic


175
0:10:11,744 --> 0:10:16,22
basis of language,
looking at the genes that are


176
0:10:16,22 --> 0:10:20,505
directly responsible for the
capacity to learn and use


177
0:10:20,505 --> 0:10:23,376
language.
And one bit of evidence that


178
0:10:23,376 --> 0:10:27,154
these genes are implicated is
that some unfortunate people


179
0:10:27,154 --> 0:10:29,74
have point mutations in these
genes.


180
0:10:29,74 --> 0:10:33,25
And such people are unable to
learn and use language.


181
0:10:33,25 --> 0:10:35,761
So, in general,
there is some support,


182
0:10:35,761 --> 0:10:39,902
at least at a very broad level,
for the claim that language is


183
0:10:39,902 --> 0:10:42,549
in some sense part of human
nature.


184
0:10:42,549 --> 0:10:44,36
Well, what do we mean by
language?


185
0:10:44,36 --> 0:10:46,559
What are we talking about when
we talk about language?


186
0:10:46,559 --> 0:10:48,975
We don't want to restrict
ourselves, for instance,


187
0:10:48,975 --> 0:10:53,799
to English or French.
What do all languages share?


188
0:10:53,799 --> 0:11:0,539
Well, all languages are
creative and this means a couple


189
0:11:0,539 --> 0:11:4,507
of things.
One meaning is the meaning


190
0:11:4,507 --> 0:11:9,245
emphasized by Rene Descartes.
When Rene Descartes argued that


191
0:11:9,245 --> 0:11:12,238
we are more than merely
machines, his best piece of


192
0:11:12,238 --> 0:11:15,59
evidence for him was the human
capacity for language.


193
0:11:15,59 --> 0:11:19,15
No machine could do this
because our capacity for


194
0:11:19,15 --> 0:11:23,436
language is unbounded and free.
We could say anything we choose


195
0:11:23,436 --> 0:11:25,74
to say.
We have free will.


196
0:11:25,74 --> 0:11:29,317
And in fact,
language allows us to produce a


197
0:11:29,317 --> 0:11:33,104
virtual infinity of sentences.
So, we could create and


198
0:11:33,104 --> 0:11:35,5
understand sentences that we
never heard before.


199
0:11:35,5 --> 0:11:38,49
And there are a lot of
sentences.


200
0:11:38,49 --> 0:11:44,991
So, if you want to estimate how
many grammatical sentences under


201
0:11:44,991 --> 0:11:49,177
twenty words in English,
the answer is,


202
0:11:49,177 --> 0:11:53,279
"a lot."
And what this means is that any


203
0:11:53,279 --> 0:11:58,209
theory of language use and
language comprehension cannot


204
0:11:58,209 --> 0:12:2,268
simply appeal to a list.
When you understand a sentence


205
0:12:2,268 --> 0:12:5,53
I said you have to have the
capacity to understand a


206
0:12:5,53 --> 0:12:7,73
sentence even if you've never
heard it before.


207
0:12:7,73 --> 0:12:11,684
And this is because we could
effortlessly produce and


208
0:12:11,684 --> 0:12:16,19
understand sentences that no
human has ever said before on


209
0:12:16,19 --> 0:12:18,785
earth.
Would anybody volunteer to say


210
0:12:18,785 --> 0:12:21,393
a sentence, non obscene,
non derogatory,


211
0:12:21,393 --> 0:12:24,201
that has never been spoken
before on earth,


212
0:12:24,201 --> 0:12:24,87
ever?


213
0:12:24,87 --> 0:12:29,85



214
0:12:29,85 --> 0:12:35,799
Here.
I'll start.


215
0:12:35,799 --> 0:12:39,751
"It's surprisingly easy to get
a purple tie on eBay if you


216
0:12:39,751 --> 0:12:43,467
don't care much about quality."
I could imagine no one else in


217
0:12:43,467 --> 0:12:47,361
the world has said this before.
"I am upset that one cannot


218
0:12:47,361 --> 0:12:52,629
easily download 'Buffy the
Vampire Slayer' through iTunes."


219
0:12:52,629 --> 0:12:56,931
Now, it's possible somebody
said both these sentences


220
0:12:56,931 --> 0:13:0,82
before, but you probably have
not heard them.


221
0:13:0,82 --> 0:13:3,48
But you understand them
immediately.


222
0:13:3,48 --> 0:13:8,551
So, how do you do it?
Well, you have rules in your


223
0:13:8,551 --> 0:13:11,424
head.
You've learnt what the words


224
0:13:11,424 --> 0:13:15,679
mean, but you have abstract and
unconscious rules that take


225
0:13:15,679 --> 0:13:18,242
these words,
figure out the order,


226
0:13:18,242 --> 0:13:22,35
and in a fraction of a second,
give rise to understanding.


227
0:13:22,35 --> 0:13:24,649
And that's the sort of thing
linguists study.


228
0:13:24,649 --> 0:13:30,438
So, take some standard examples
from the linguistic study of


229
0:13:30,438 --> 0:13:32,976
English.
And bear in mind the rules


230
0:13:32,976 --> 0:13:36,57
we're talking about here are not
rules you explicitly know.


231
0:13:36,57 --> 0:13:40,422
They're automatic rules of the
same sort we're going to talk


232
0:13:40,422 --> 0:13:44,78
about in the context of visual
perception in that they're


233
0:13:44,78 --> 0:13:47,604
implicit and unconscious and not
accessible to explicit


234
0:13:47,604 --> 0:13:50,214
understanding.
So for instance,


235
0:13:50,214 --> 0:13:55,189
immediately you read "The pig
is eager to eat" versus "The pig


236
0:13:55,189 --> 0:13:59,512
is easy to eat" and in a
fraction of a second you know


237
0:13:59,512 --> 0:14:4,254
there's an important difference.
"The pig is eager to eat" means


238
0:14:4,254 --> 0:14:7,592
the state of affairs that we're
talking about is when the pig


239
0:14:7,592 --> 0:14:10,303
does the eating.
"The pig is easy to eat" is


240
0:14:10,303 --> 0:14:14,62
when the pig is being eaten.
You would see a sentence like


241
0:14:14,62 --> 0:14:17,7
"Bill knew that John liked him"
and you know,


242
0:14:17,7 --> 0:14:19,6
without even knowing how you
know,


243
0:14:19,6 --> 0:14:24,557
that this could mean that Bill
knew that John liked Bill or it


244
0:14:24,557 --> 0:14:28,539
could mean that Bill knew that
John liked Fred.


245
0:14:28,539 --> 0:14:32,789
But it can't mean that Bill
knew that John liked John.


246
0:14:32,789 --> 0:14:35,56
The natural interpretation,
in fact, is that Bill knew that


247
0:14:35,56 --> 0:14:39,19
John liked Bill.
The two words co-refer.


248
0:14:39,19 --> 0:14:42,958
Contrast that with "Bill knew
that John liked himself," which


249
0:14:42,958 --> 0:14:46,35
only has the meaning Bill knew
that John liked John.


250
0:14:46,35 --> 0:14:49,353
And this is what linguists do
for a living so if you hear me


251
0:14:49,353 --> 0:14:52,564
talking about this and say,
"I want to spend the next forty


252
0:14:52,564 --> 0:14:56,9
years of my life studying that,"
you should become a linguist.


253
0:14:56,9 --> 0:14:59,141
But that's the sort of--those
are the sort of phenomena that


254
0:14:59,141 --> 0:15:2,9
we're interested in.
Now, it gets more complicated.


255
0:15:2,9 --> 0:15:5,474
Those are examples from syntax,
but language has many


256
0:15:5,474 --> 0:15:8,344
structures.
Language has structures going


257
0:15:8,344 --> 0:15:12,638
from the bottom to the top.
All languages--All human


258
0:15:12,638 --> 0:15:17,9
languages have phonology,
which is the system of sounds


259
0:15:17,9 --> 0:15:21,84
or signs;
morphology, which is the system


260
0:15:21,84 --> 0:15:26,39
of words or morphemes,
basic units of meaning;


261
0:15:26,39 --> 0:15:30,68
and syntax, which refer to
rules and principles that put


262
0:15:30,68 --> 0:15:34,169
together words and phrases into
meaningful utterances.


263
0:15:34,169 --> 0:15:38,543
And I want to talk briefly
about each of these three parts


264
0:15:38,543 --> 0:15:42,379
of language before looking at
some other issues.


265
0:15:42,379 --> 0:15:45,363
I'm indebted here to Steven
Pinker's excellent book The


266
0:15:45,363 --> 0:15:47,719
Language Instinct which
provides, I think,


267
0:15:47,719 --> 0:15:49,97
a superb discussion of these
phenomena.


268
0:15:49,97 --> 0:15:53,86
And I'm going to steal some of
my examples from Pinker.


269
0:15:53,86 --> 0:15:59,142
So, phonology.
Phonology is the system of


270
0:15:59,142 --> 0:16:1,58
sounds that languages have.


271
0:16:1,58 --> 0:16:8,65



272
0:16:8,65 --> 0:16:11,66
There's a subset.
There's a list,


273
0:16:11,66 --> 0:16:13,81
a finite list,
of possible sounds that


274
0:16:13,81 --> 0:16:15,611
language can use.
I'm going to put aside for the


275
0:16:15,611 --> 0:16:18,35
moment the question of sign
languages and how they work.


276
0:16:18,35 --> 0:16:20,32
I'm going to talk about them in
a little bit.


277
0:16:20,32 --> 0:16:25,879
The idea is that English has
about forty of these phonemes.


278
0:16:25,879 --> 0:16:29,599
So, if you're a native
monolingual speaker of English


279
0:16:29,599 --> 0:16:33,604
you hear speech and each sound
you hear is categorized as


280
0:16:33,604 --> 0:16:37,37
falling into one of those forty
morphemes--sorry,


281
0:16:37,37 --> 0:16:39,965
phonemes.
So, for example,


282
0:16:39,965 --> 0:16:46,69
English has a phoneme of "lu,"
"l," and a phoneme of "r."


283
0:16:46,69 --> 0:16:50,302
And so, an English speaker can
hear the difference between


284
0:16:50,302 --> 0:16:53,598
"lip" and "rip" and that
corresponds to two different


285
0:16:53,598 --> 0:16:57,305
words in English.
Other languages don't have that


286
0:16:57,305 --> 0:17:1,518
distinction and so those
distinctions are very difficult


287
0:17:1,518 --> 0:17:4,89
for non-native English speakers
to learn.


288
0:17:4,89 --> 0:17:9,148
So, part of what goes on when
you learn, is you have to learn


289
0:17:9,148 --> 0:17:12,839
the language--the phonemes that
your language has.


290
0:17:12,839 --> 0:17:17,89
Another part of the problem of
learning language is you have to


291
0:17:17,89 --> 0:17:20,859
figure out what the boundaries
are between the words.


292
0:17:20,859 --> 0:17:23,561
You have to use sound signals
to figure out the boundaries


293
0:17:23,561 --> 0:17:26,319
between the words.
Now that--If the only language


294
0:17:26,319 --> 0:17:29,698
you've ever heard is English,
that's going to seem like a


295
0:17:29,698 --> 0:17:33,136
really weird example of a
problem because you're listening


296
0:17:33,136 --> 0:17:36,695
to me speak and in between each
of my words you're hearing a


297
0:17:36,695 --> 0:17:38,993
pause.
You don't have to be very smart


298
0:17:38,993 --> 0:17:41,68
to figure out where one word
begins and one word ends.


299
0:17:41,68 --> 0:17:45,9
But the pause is a
psychological illusion.


300
0:17:45,9 --> 0:17:49,17
If you were to just talk into
an oscilloscope that measured


301
0:17:49,17 --> 0:17:52,679
your sound vibrations,
there are no pauses between the


302
0:17:52,679 --> 0:17:55,597
words.
Rather, the pauses are inserted


303
0:17:55,597 --> 0:17:59,692
by your mind as you already know
where one word begins and


304
0:17:59,692 --> 0:18:3,392
another one ends.
And you insert a pause at that


305
0:18:3,392 --> 0:18:5,967
point.
You could see this when you


306
0:18:5,967 --> 0:18:9,0
hear a language you don't
already know.


307
0:18:9,0 --> 0:18:12,261
So, for those of you who have
never heard French before,


308
0:18:12,261 --> 0:18:15,701
when you hear somebody say,
"Je ne sais pas" you could say,


309
0:18:15,701 --> 0:18:18,594
"Remarkable!
French has no pauses between


310
0:18:18,594 --> 0:18:21,27
words."
And you-- And now a French


311
0:18:21,27 --> 0:18:24,859
speaker, of course,
hears "Je ne sais pas."


312
0:18:24,859 --> 0:18:28,278
For Hebrew, I know one sentence
in Hebrew: "Sleecha,


313
0:18:28,278 --> 0:18:31,898
eypho ha-sheeruteem" which I
think is a request for the


314
0:18:31,898 --> 0:18:35,87
bathroom.
But if you don't know Hebrew


315
0:18:35,87 --> 0:18:37,869
there's no pauses.
And the truth is,


316
0:18:37,869 --> 0:18:40,572
when you each gave your
demonstrations,


317
0:18:40,572 --> 0:18:44,342
nobody spoke properly because
nobody spoke--Here's the


318
0:18:44,342 --> 0:18:47,329
sentence: "Glorp fendel smug
wuggle."


319
0:18:47,329 --> 0:18:51,652
Rather, you all sounded like,
"blublublublublub" without any


320
0:18:51,652 --> 0:18:54,95
pauses because I don't know your
languages.


321
0:18:54,95 --> 0:18:59,553
Children come into the world
without knowing any specific


322
0:18:59,553 --> 0:19:3,17
language and so they have to
learn pauses.


323
0:19:3,17 --> 0:19:8,3
They have to learn to interpret
sounds in context and sometimes


324
0:19:8,3 --> 0:19:11,698
they make mistakes.
They get problems of


325
0:19:11,698 --> 0:19:13,903
segmentation.
And there are some


326
0:19:13,903 --> 0:19:16,287
illustrations.
You could see their mistakes if


327
0:19:16,287 --> 0:19:19,612
they're trying to repeat back
something that's already known


328
0:19:19,612 --> 0:19:22,64
within a society.
So, songs are a good example.


329
0:19:22,64 --> 0:19:24,46
These are excerpts from
children.


330
0:19:24,46 --> 0:19:27,49
"I'll never be your pizza
burnin'."


331
0:19:27,49 --> 0:19:29,61
Anybody know--figure out what
that corresponds to?


332
0:19:29,61 --> 0:19:31,948
Student: Beast of burden?
Professor Paul Bloom:


333
0:19:31,948 --> 0:19:33,69
"Beast of burden."
Very good.


334
0:19:33,69 --> 0:19:38,789
"A girl with colitis goes by."
Somebody?


335
0:19:38,789 --> 0:19:41,29
Student: "A girl with
kaleidoscope eyes."


336
0:19:41,29 --> 0:19:42,18
Professor Paul Bloom:
"The ants are my friends;


337
0:19:42,18 --> 0:19:48,862
they're blowin' in the wind."
And [laughter]


338
0:19:48,862 --> 0:19:54,539
this is a religious one.
"Our father with Bart in heaven;


339
0:19:54,539 --> 0:19:59,444
Harold be they name… Lead us
not into Penn Station…" Now,


340
0:19:59,444 --> 0:20:4,185
phonological understanding
illustrates all sorts of aspects


341
0:20:4,185 --> 0:20:8,859
of language processing and,
in fact, of consciousness.


342
0:20:8,859 --> 0:20:13,414
Because remember I said that,
typically, when you hear a


343
0:20:13,414 --> 0:20:17,638
sentence you make--you
manufacture in your mind gaps


344
0:20:17,638 --> 0:20:21,258
between the words.
Typically, when there's


345
0:20:21,258 --> 0:20:25,325
something which is unclear
you'll fill in the gap and


346
0:20:25,325 --> 0:20:29,41
figure out what the word is.
And you'll hear it that way.


347
0:20:29,41 --> 0:20:32,323
So, the few examples--The best
examples, again,


348
0:20:32,323 --> 0:20:37,259
are for when it goes wrong.
So, a classic example is from


349
0:20:37,259 --> 0:20:41,319
the song "Super Freak" by Rick
James.


350
0:20:41,319 --> 0:20:46,86
I got a big lecture about
copyright laws and this is going


351
0:20:46,86 --> 0:20:49,27
to violate most of them.
Rick James is going to be


352
0:20:49,27 --> 0:20:51,533
sitting on the--at--staring at
the web two years from now


353
0:20:51,533 --> 0:20:53,0
saying, "Hey.
That's my thing."


354
0:20:53,0 --> 0:20:55,522
Okay.
So, I want you to listen to


355
0:20:55,522 --> 0:20:59,553
this line.
I'm sure most of you have heard


356
0:20:59,553 --> 0:21:4,53
this before but I want you to
listen closely.


357
0:21:4,53 --> 0:21:6,5
What was that last line?


358
0:21:6,5 --> 0:21:15,29



359
0:21:15,29 --> 0:21:17,47
[laughter]
"The kind of girl you read


360
0:21:17,47 --> 0:21:20,521
about--" Well,
it turns out that nobody really


361
0:21:20,521 --> 0:21:23,687
knows.
And it sounds to many people


362
0:21:23,687 --> 0:21:28,13
who do top-down interpretation
as--to me as well,


363
0:21:28,13 --> 0:21:30,49
that "she's the kind of girl
you read about in


364
0:21:30,49 --> 0:21:34,597
Newsweek magazine."
But that makes no sense at all


365
0:21:34,597 --> 0:21:39,79
given that you don't want to
"bring home to Mama."


366
0:21:39,79 --> 0:21:42,207
And she's--and it's not
the--and in fact,


367
0:21:42,207 --> 0:21:46,38
if you check the notes on the
song, she's in fact,


368
0:21:46,38 --> 0:21:50,73
"the kind of girl you read
about in new wave magazines."


369
0:21:50,73 --> 0:21:57,233
Now, when you listen to it
then, again, knowing that,


370
0:21:57,233 --> 0:22:2,173
you hear it that way.
Now, this top-down--This is


371
0:22:2,173 --> 0:22:6,953
known as "top-down" processing.
Top-down processing is an


372
0:22:6,953 --> 0:22:12,366
example of when you know what
something is you hear it that


373
0:22:12,366 --> 0:22:16,212
way.
And this is extremely useful


374
0:22:16,212 --> 0:22:21,23
when it comes to filling in gaps
in sounds.


375
0:22:21,23 --> 0:22:26,29
In normal conversation,
if I'm to say "s-- entence" you


376
0:22:26,29 --> 0:22:29,57
won't hear that as "s--
entence."


377
0:22:29,57 --> 0:22:32,25
Rather, you hear "sentence."
You fill in the gap.


378
0:22:32,25 --> 0:22:36,999
This can lead to problems.
The problem it's led to in my


379
0:22:36,999 --> 0:22:41,26
life revolves around the song
"Get Crunk" [laughter]


380
0:22:41,26 --> 0:22:45,685
because I've heard "Get Crunk"
and my children asked me if I


381
0:22:45,685 --> 0:22:49,16
would buy them "Get Crunk" from
iTunes.


382
0:22:49,16 --> 0:22:53,0
My children are eight and ten.
And now "Get Crunk," as I was


383
0:22:53,0 --> 0:22:57,9
aware from having heard it
before, involves the consistent


384
0:22:57,9 --> 0:23:0,319
refrain of "get crunk" extremely
bad word,


385
0:23:0,319 --> 0:23:4,109
"get crunk" extremely bad word,
and so I said "no."


386
0:23:4,109 --> 0:23:6,264
And then they said,
"Well, there's a clean version


387
0:23:6,264 --> 0:23:9,118
of it."
So, I downloaded the clean


388
0:23:9,118 --> 0:23:10,987
version.
Unfortunately,


389
0:23:10,987 --> 0:23:14,766
knowing what the clean
version--knowing what the word


390
0:23:14,766 --> 0:23:18,69
is means to me the clean version
is not very clean.


391
0:23:18,69 --> 0:23:21,896
Now, I will add,
[laughter]


392
0:23:21,896 --> 0:23:28,68
before people write letters and
stuff, this is the clean


393
0:23:28,68 --> 0:23:31,348
version.
[laughter]


394
0:23:31,348 --> 0:23:37,17
Thank goodness they took away
that obscene word.


395
0:23:37,17 --> 0:23:42,1
[laughter] Okay.
So, top-down processing affects


396
0:23:42,1 --> 0:23:45,313
how we hear things,
usually, almost always,


397
0:23:45,313 --> 0:23:47,395
for the better.
And in fact,


398
0:23:47,395 --> 0:23:50,804
this is a theme we're going to
return to next class when we


399
0:23:50,804 --> 0:23:54,213
talk about vision because the
same thing is going to happen


400
0:23:54,213 --> 0:23:57,686
there.
How we see the world is often


401
0:23:57,686 --> 0:24:3,73
confusing and befuddled but what
we know can clear things up.


402
0:24:3,73 --> 0:24:4,63
Same with sound.


403
0:24:4,63 --> 0:24:8,0



404
0:24:8,0 --> 0:24:11,84
Morphology is the next level up.
Phonology is sounds.


405
0:24:11,84 --> 0:24:16,28
Morphology is words.
And human language uses this


406
0:24:16,28 --> 0:24:19,812
amazing trick described by
Ferdinand de Saussure,


407
0:24:19,812 --> 0:24:23,27
the great linguist,
as "the arbitrariness of the


408
0:24:23,27 --> 0:24:26,593
sign."
And what this means is we can


409
0:24:26,593 --> 0:24:31,88
use--take any arbitrary idea in
the world, the idea of a chair


410
0:24:31,88 --> 0:24:36,704
or a story or a country,
and make a sound or a sign to


411
0:24:36,704 --> 0:24:40,16
connect to it.
And the link is arbitrary.


412
0:24:40,16 --> 0:24:44,75
You might choose to use a word
for "dog" as "woof woof" because


413
0:24:44,75 --> 0:24:49,44
it sounds like a dog but you
can't use a word for "country"


414
0:24:49,44 --> 0:24:53,78
that sounds like a country.
You could use a sign language


415
0:24:53,78 --> 0:24:56,674
thing for "drink" that looks
sort of like the act of drinking


416
0:24:56,674 --> 0:25:0,31
but you can't use a sign
language word for "country" that


417
0:25:0,31 --> 0:25:3,78
looks like a country,
or for "idea" that looks like


418
0:25:3,78 --> 0:25:6,618
an idea.
So, the way languages work is


419
0:25:6,618 --> 0:25:11,821
it allows for arbitrary naming.
It allows for this map between


420
0:25:11,821 --> 0:25:17,369
a symbol, say a spoken word,
and any sort of thought we want


421
0:25:17,369 --> 0:25:20,823
to use.
And those arbitrary mappings,


422
0:25:20,823 --> 0:25:25,329
as we come to learn them,
make up the vocabulary of a


423
0:25:25,329 --> 0:25:28,69
language.
I'm talking about words but the


424
0:25:28,69 --> 0:25:31,309
more technical term is
"morpheme."


425
0:25:31,309 --> 0:25:35,546
And what a morpheme is is the
smallest meaningful unit in a


426
0:25:35,546 --> 0:25:38,221
language.
Now often, this is the same


427
0:25:38,221 --> 0:25:40,789
thing as a word.
So, "dog" is a word.


428
0:25:40,789 --> 0:25:43,991
And "dog" is also a morpheme,
but not always because there


429
0:25:43,991 --> 0:25:46,968
are single morphemes and then
there are words that are


430
0:25:46,968 --> 0:25:51,466
composed of many morphemes.
So, "dogs" and "complained" are


431
0:25:51,466 --> 0:25:57,69
one word, but two morphemes and
what this means is that you make


432
0:25:57,69 --> 0:26:1,16
the word by putting together two
morphemes.


433
0:26:1,16 --> 0:26:4,435
To put it differently,
in order to know what "dogs"


434
0:26:4,435 --> 0:26:7,579
means, you never had to learn
the word "dogs."


435
0:26:7,579 --> 0:26:11,628
All you had to know is the word
"dog" and the plural morpheme


436
0:26:11,628 --> 0:26:15,339
's' and you could put them
together to create a word.


437
0:26:15,339 --> 0:26:20,2
How many morphemes does the
average speaker know?


438
0:26:20,2 --> 0:26:25,217
The answer is fairly startling.
The average speaker knows,


439
0:26:25,217 --> 0:26:28,97
as a low-ball estimate,
about 60,000 words.


440
0:26:28,97 --> 0:26:34,849
I think the proper estimate is
closer to 80,000 or 100,000.


441
0:26:34,849 --> 0:26:37,27
What this means,
if you average it out,


442
0:26:37,27 --> 0:26:40,294
is that since children start
learning their first words at


443
0:26:40,294 --> 0:26:44,959
about their first year of life,
they learn about nine new words


444
0:26:44,959 --> 0:26:49,772
a day.
And it's not a continuous nine


445
0:26:49,772 --> 0:26:54,13
words every day.
It goes up and down depending


446
0:26:54,13 --> 0:26:56,8
on the age.
But still, the amount of words


447
0:26:56,8 --> 0:27:0,71
we know is staggering.
How many of you know more than


448
0:27:0,71 --> 0:27:4,891
one language pretty fluently?
Those of you who know other


449
0:27:4,891 --> 0:27:8,804
languages might have in your
heads 200,000 words or 300,000


450
0:27:8,804 --> 0:27:12,92
words and you're accessing them
in a fraction of a second.


451
0:27:12,92 --> 0:27:18,254
It is--could legitimately be
seen as one of the most


452
0:27:18,254 --> 0:27:22,2
astonishing things that people
do.


453
0:27:22,2 --> 0:27:26,28
Finally, syntax.
So, we have the sound system of


454
0:27:26,28 --> 0:27:29,381
a language, the phonology.
We have the words of a


455
0:27:29,381 --> 0:27:33,36
language, the morphology,
but all that gives you is


456
0:27:33,36 --> 0:27:37,42
"dog," "cup," "chair," "house,"
"story," "idea."


457
0:27:37,42 --> 0:27:41,299
That won't allow us to
communicate complicated ideas.


458
0:27:41,299 --> 0:27:45,59
So, the final step in the story
is syntax.


459
0:27:45,59 --> 0:27:49,423
And syntax refers to those
rules and principles that allow


460
0:27:49,423 --> 0:27:54,17
us to combine words into phrases
and phrases into sentences.


461
0:27:54,17 --> 0:27:59,616
And syntax uses another neat
trick and this is defined by


462
0:27:59,616 --> 0:28:5,55
Wilhelm von Humboldt as the
"infinite use of finite media."


463
0:28:5,55 --> 0:28:9,17
So, here's the question.
Your vocabulary is finite.


464
0:28:9,17 --> 0:28:12,681
There are just so many words.
You have to learn them one by


465
0:28:12,681 --> 0:28:16,72
one, but you could produce a
virtual infinity of sentences.


466
0:28:16,72 --> 0:28:20,738
How can you do that?
How can you go from a finite


467
0:28:20,738 --> 0:28:25,359
list of symbols to an infinite
number of sentences?


468
0:28:25,359 --> 0:28:30,789
And the answer is you have a
combinatorial system.


469
0:28:30,789 --> 0:28:34,965
Now, language is not the only
thing in culture or nature that


470
0:28:34,965 --> 0:28:37,75
has this sort of combinatorial
system.


471
0:28:37,75 --> 0:28:40,789
Music also has a combinatorial
system.


472
0:28:40,789 --> 0:28:43,839
There's a finite number of
notes but a limitless number of


473
0:28:43,839 --> 0:28:47,545
musical compositions.
DNA also has this sort of


474
0:28:47,545 --> 0:28:53,89
combinatorial system where you
have a finite number of,


475
0:28:53,89 --> 0:28:57,176
I guess, bases or amino acids
that could combine to a possible


476
0:28:57,176 --> 0:29:0,81
infinity of strings,
of DNA strings.


477
0:29:0,81 --> 0:29:3,9



478
0:29:3,9 --> 0:29:8,233
So, how does this happen?
Well, the infinity mechanism,


479
0:29:8,233 --> 0:29:11,253
and many of you will be
familiar with this from


480
0:29:11,253 --> 0:29:14,47
mathematics or computer science,
is recursion.


481
0:29:14,47 --> 0:29:17,744
And there's a lot to be said
about this but it could be


482
0:29:17,744 --> 0:29:20,17
pretty simply illustrated in
language.


483
0:29:20,17 --> 0:29:22,68
So, here's an example of a
simple language.


484
0:29:22,68 --> 0:29:27,1
It's not--It's actually close
to how linguists describe normal


485
0:29:27,1 --> 0:29:31,89
languages, but it's very simple.
It has three nouns,


486
0:29:31,89 --> 0:29:34,889
"Fred," "Barney" and "Wilma,"
and two verbs,


487
0:29:34,889 --> 0:29:38,59
"thinks" and "likes."
A very simple language.


488
0:29:38,59 --> 0:29:42,783
And one rule.
And the way to read this rule


489
0:29:42,783 --> 0:29:47,46
is you make a sentence by taking
a noun, any noun,


490
0:29:47,46 --> 0:29:51,57
putting a verb after it,
and then following that verb


491
0:29:51,57 --> 0:29:54,849
with a noun.
Now, when you do this,


492
0:29:54,849 --> 0:29:57,712
how many--And then so,
for instance,


493
0:29:57,712 --> 0:30:1,23
you get the sentence "Fred
likes Wilma."


494
0:30:1,23 --> 0:30:4,349
When you do this,
how many possible sentences are


495
0:30:4,349 --> 0:30:6,91
there?
Let me just take a second.


496
0:30:6,91 --> 0:30:12,9
Okay.
Any guesses?


497
0:30:12,9 --> 0:30:16,268
Eighteen.
The sentences are "Fred likes


498
0:30:16,268 --> 0:30:19,13
Fred," "Fred likes Barney,"
"Fred likes Wilma,"


499
0:30:19,13 --> 0:30:21,976
"Fred thinks Fred," "Fred
thinks Barney," "Fred thinks


500
0:30:21,976 --> 0:30:25,28
Wilma," and so on.
The three nouns followed by any


501
0:30:25,28 --> 0:30:28,41
of the two verbs followed by any
of the three nouns.


502
0:30:28,41 --> 0:30:30,74
That is not a very interesting
language.


503
0:30:30,74 --> 0:30:34,777
But now, take a more
complicated language--same


504
0:30:34,777 --> 0:30:39,341
vocabulary, the same three
nouns, the same two verbs,


505
0:30:39,341 --> 0:30:43,73
the same sentence,
but now one other sentence.


506
0:30:43,73 --> 0:30:48,529
This sentence expands to a noun
followed by a verb followed by a


507
0:30:48,529 --> 0:30:51,5
sentence and there you get
recursion.


508
0:30:51,5 --> 0:30:57,96
You have one rule invoking
another rule and then you can


509
0:30:57,96 --> 0:31:4,42
get a sentence like "Fred thinks
Barney likes Wilma."


510
0:31:4,42 --> 0:31:9,18
And here you get a potential
infinity of sentences.


511
0:31:9,18 --> 0:31:14,201
And this is obviously a toy
example but you could see the


512
0:31:14,201 --> 0:31:19,134
use of recursion in everyday
life and in everyday use of


513
0:31:19,134 --> 0:31:21,18
language.
You could say,


514
0:31:21,18 --> 0:31:24,701
"John hates cheese," "My
roommate heard a rumor that John


515
0:31:24,701 --> 0:31:26,9
hates cheese,"
"It disturbed Mary when I told


516
0:31:26,9 --> 0:31:29,16
her that my roommate heard a
rumor that John hates cheese,"


517
0:31:29,16 --> 0:31:31,263
"I was amazed that it disturbed
Mary when I told her that my


518
0:31:31,263 --> 0:31:33,9
roommate heard a rumor that John
hates cheese,"


519
0:31:33,9 --> 0:31:34,89
"Professor Bloom had devoted
way too much of his lecture


520
0:31:34,89 --> 0:31:36,258
talking about how I was amazed
[laughter]


521
0:31:36,258 --> 0:31:38,31
that it disturbed Mary when I
told her that my roommate heard


522
0:31:38,31 --> 0:31:42,119
a rumor that John hates cheese,"
"It really bothered me that--"


523
0:31:42,119 --> 0:31:46,79
and there's no limit.
There's no longest sentence.


524
0:31:46,79 --> 0:31:49,213
You could keep producing a
sentence deeper and deeper


525
0:31:49,213 --> 0:31:52,867
embedded until you die.
And this is part of the power


526
0:31:52,867 --> 0:31:56,247
of language.
Now, the syntactic rules are


527
0:31:56,247 --> 0:31:59,136
complicated.
And one of the puzzles of


528
0:31:59,136 --> 0:32:2,315
syntactic rules,
or one of the issues of them,


529
0:32:2,315 --> 0:32:6,13
is that different rules can
conspire to create the same


530
0:32:6,13 --> 0:32:8,771
sentence.
So, you take a sentence


531
0:32:8,771 --> 0:32:12,74
like--This is a classic line
from Groucho Marx:


532
0:32:12,74 --> 0:32:15,89
"I once shot an elephant in my
pajamas.


533
0:32:15,89 --> 0:32:17,91
How it got into my pajamas I'll
never know."


534
0:32:17,91 --> 0:32:20,131
And the humor,
such that it is,


535
0:32:20,131 --> 0:32:24,204
revolves around the ambiguity
of rules that generate it,


536
0:32:24,204 --> 0:32:29,553
like this versus like this.
Often, to illustrate the issues


537
0:32:29,553 --> 0:32:33,591
of ambiguity,
people have collected poorly


538
0:32:33,591 --> 0:32:38,614
thought-out headlines in
newspaper reports that play


539
0:32:38,614 --> 0:32:42,849
on--that inadvertently have
ambiguity.


540
0:32:42,849 --> 0:32:45,809
"Complaints about NBA referees
growing ugly."


541
0:32:45,809 --> 0:32:48,73
So, that's the beauty of that
structure.


542
0:32:48,73 --> 0:32:54,461
"Kids make nutritious snacks."
"No one was injured in a blast


543
0:32:54,461 --> 0:32:58,314
which was attributed to the
buildup of gas by one town


544
0:32:58,314 --> 0:33:1,811
official."
Last summer I was in Seoul


545
0:33:1,811 --> 0:33:7,602
visiting the--visiting Korea
University and the big headline


546
0:33:7,602 --> 0:33:13,197
there on the front page was
"General arrested for fondling


547
0:33:13,197 --> 0:33:15,522
privates."
[laughter]


548
0:33:15,522 --> 0:33:20,126
Now, there actually is--The
ambiguity is actually quite


549
0:33:20,126 --> 0:33:24,815
difficult to avoid in the
construction and understanding


550
0:33:24,815 --> 0:33:28,47
of sentences.
It's one of the ways in which


551
0:33:28,47 --> 0:33:31,89
it's often difficult to write
clearly, and in fact,


552
0:33:31,89 --> 0:33:36,125
there's a whole sub-field of
the law involving the use of


553
0:33:36,125 --> 0:33:40,621
linguistic theory to
disambiguate sentences both in


554
0:33:40,621 --> 0:33:44,357
the Constitution,
in legislation,


555
0:33:44,357 --> 0:33:48,67
as well as in some criminal
cases.


556
0:33:48,67 --> 0:33:51,837
And there was,
several years ago,


557
0:33:51,837 --> 0:33:57,48
a very serious criminal case
that rested on a sentence.


558
0:33:57,48 --> 0:34:0,438
And here's what happened.
There were two brothers,


559
0:34:0,438 --> 0:34:3,599
one of them retarded,
and they get into a robbery.


560
0:34:3,599 --> 0:34:9,289
And a police officer sees them
and points the gun at them.


561
0:34:9,289 --> 0:34:15,48
And one of the brothers points
a gun at the police officer.


562
0:34:15,48 --> 0:34:19,683
The police officer shouts for
the brother, the non-retarded


563
0:34:19,683 --> 0:34:23,138
brother, to drop the gun.
Actually, he said,


564
0:34:23,138 --> 0:34:27,294
"Give me the gun."
The retarded brother shouted,


565
0:34:27,294 --> 0:34:32,532
"Let him have it," whereupon
the brother shot and killed the


566
0:34:32,532 --> 0:34:35,842
police officer.
Now, the brother who did the


567
0:34:35,842 --> 0:34:39,347
shooting was plainly a murderer.
What about that brother who


568
0:34:39,347 --> 0:34:43,448
shouted, "Let him have it"?
Well, it depends on what he--on


569
0:34:43,448 --> 0:34:47,906
how you interpret that sentence
because the sentence is


570
0:34:47,906 --> 0:34:52,189
beautifully ambiguous.
It could mean "shoot him,


571
0:34:52,189 --> 0:34:56,804
let him have it," or it could
mean "give him the gun,


572
0:34:56,804 --> 0:34:59,167
let him have it."
And in fact,


573
0:34:59,167 --> 0:35:1,762
the trial, which I think
somebody could--If people out


574
0:35:1,762 --> 0:35:4,26
there know about this,
please send me an e-mail.


575
0:35:4,26 --> 0:35:8,63
My understanding was he was
found guilty but a lot to turn


576
0:35:8,63 --> 0:35:13,349
on the ambiguity of a sentence.
I want to shift now and talk


577
0:35:13,349 --> 0:35:17,495
about where does all this
knowledge come from but I'll


578
0:35:17,495 --> 0:35:22,11
stop and answer any questions
about the material so far.


579
0:35:22,11 --> 0:35:24,809
What are your questions?
Yes.


580
0:35:24,809 --> 0:35:27,565
Student: How does syntax
differ from grammar or are they


581
0:35:27,565 --> 0:35:29,207
exactly the same?
Professor Paul Bloom:


582
0:35:29,207 --> 0:35:30,718
Syntax--The question is,
"How is syntax different from


583
0:35:30,718 --> 0:35:33,119
grammar?"
They're exactly the same.


584
0:35:33,119 --> 0:35:39,451
Syntax is a more technical term
but it means the same thing as


585
0:35:39,451 --> 0:35:41,51
grammar.
Yes.


586
0:35:41,51 --> 0:35:44,59
Student: You said that
every normal human being that's


587
0:35:44,59 --> 0:35:47,619
born uses at some point or
another some kind of language.


588
0:35:47,619 --> 0:35:52,618
Aren't there people who weren't
born within a culture and grew


589
0:35:52,618 --> 0:35:57,207
up and who never really spoke a
language though they were


590
0:35:57,207 --> 0:35:59,561
physically normal?
Professor Paul Bloom:


591
0:35:59,561 --> 0:36:1,37
Yes.
I'm glad you actually asked me


592
0:36:1,37 --> 0:36:2,506
about that because,
as I said it,


593
0:36:2,506 --> 0:36:4,159
I realized it wasn't quite
right.


594
0:36:4,159 --> 0:36:7,942
The point that was just raised
here is I had said before that


595
0:36:7,942 --> 0:36:11,536
everybody who's neurologically
normal comes to acquire and


596
0:36:11,536 --> 0:36:14,606
learn a language.
But what about people who are


597
0:36:14,606 --> 0:36:18,46
neurologically normal but they
don't have language around them?


598
0:36:18,46 --> 0:36:20,166
And in fact,
there have been,


599
0:36:20,166 --> 0:36:22,3
historically,
some cases of this.


600
0:36:22,3 --> 0:36:24,662
There's been,
probably apocryphal,


601
0:36:24,662 --> 0:36:29,3
stories about children who are
raised by wolves or by dogs.


602
0:36:29,3 --> 0:36:31,525
There are stories,
horrible stories,


603
0:36:31,525 --> 0:36:35,732
some in the twentieth century,
about children who are locked


604
0:36:35,732 --> 0:36:40,51
away by insane or evil parents
and have never learned to speak.


605
0:36:40,51 --> 0:36:43,738
There are stories of deaf
people who are within certain


606
0:36:43,738 --> 0:36:47,206
societies where nobody signs to
them, and so they're what's


607
0:36:47,206 --> 0:36:50,979
known as linguistic isolates.
And they themselves never learn


608
0:36:50,979 --> 0:36:53,337
to speak.
And those cases are the


609
0:36:53,337 --> 0:36:57,28
dramatic exception and they do
tell you something.


610
0:36:57,28 --> 0:36:59,118
They tell you that it's not
enough to have a brain for


611
0:36:59,118 --> 0:37:2,3
language.
Somebody does have to use it


612
0:37:2,3 --> 0:37:4,5
with you.
Interestingly,


613
0:37:4,5 --> 0:37:7,929
it doesn't have to be that many
people.


614
0:37:7,929 --> 0:37:11,533
So, Susan Goldin-Meadow has
studied deaf children that


615
0:37:11,533 --> 0:37:15,476
nobody signed to but what she
studies is deaf children with


616
0:37:15,476 --> 0:37:19,42
deaf siblings and these children
don't just sit there.


617
0:37:19,42 --> 0:37:23,52
They create their own language.
It's not a full-blown language


618
0:37:23,52 --> 0:37:25,656
like American sign-language or
langue des signes


619
0:37:25,656 --> 0:37:28,26
quebecoise but it's a
language nonetheless,


620
0:37:28,26 --> 0:37:31,3
with words and syntax and
phonology.


621
0:37:31,3 --> 0:37:39,4
It's an interesting question.
Any other questions?


622
0:37:39,4 --> 0:37:46,154
Yes.
Student: Could it be


623
0:37:46,154 --> 0:37:56,46
argued that there are inherent
limits to grammar?


624
0:37:56,46 --> 0:37:58,59
Professor Paul Bloom:
It's a good question.


625
0:37:58,59 --> 0:38:0,63
The question is,
"Are there inherent limits in


626
0:38:0,63 --> 0:38:3,3
our abilities to come up with
grammars?"


627
0:38:3,3 --> 0:38:7,18
And most linguists would argue
"yes," that languages are highly


628
0:38:7,18 --> 0:38:9,59
constrained in how they do
things.


629
0:38:9,59 --> 0:38:12,947
So, for instance,
one example is there's no


630
0:38:12,947 --> 0:38:17,343
language in the world that ever
constructs a question by


631
0:38:17,343 --> 0:38:21,659
switching the order of words
around in a sentence.


632
0:38:21,659 --> 0:38:25,731
There's no language in the
world that has a rule that says


633
0:38:25,731 --> 0:38:29,559
the fifth word has to be a verb.
And linguists have all of these


634
0:38:29,559 --> 0:38:31,862
conditions they say,
"no language in the world works


635
0:38:31,862 --> 0:38:33,462
this way."
Now this is--;So,


636
0:38:33,462 --> 0:38:36,44
these are constraints on
grammar and they're really


637
0:38:36,44 --> 0:38:39,775
interesting because they tell us
what's a humanly natural


638
0:38:39,775 --> 0:38:43,289
language versus what's not a
humanly natural language.


639
0:38:43,289 --> 0:38:46,603
But notice, even if there is
incredible constraints on


640
0:38:46,603 --> 0:38:50,354
grammars, still--we could still
produce an infinite number of


641
0:38:50,354 --> 0:38:53,458
sentences.
It's just like if you restrict


642
0:38:53,458 --> 0:38:57,321
me to only a subset of numbers,
only the odd numbers,


643
0:38:57,321 --> 0:39:0,59
still there's an infinity of
odd numbers.


644
0:39:0,59 --> 0:39:7,132
So, grammar can be restricted
but still give rise to an


645
0:39:7,132 --> 0:39:13,204
infinity of possible sentences.
Well, there's a radical claim


646
0:39:13,204 --> 0:39:17,354
about the origin of language
associated with the guy who we


647
0:39:17,354 --> 0:39:20,932
met when we talked about
behaviorism who wrote A


648
0:39:20,932 --> 0:39:24,949
Review of Verbal Behavior,
 the linguist Noam Chomsky.


649
0:39:24,949 --> 0:39:28,79
And Chomsky makes this radical
claim.


650
0:39:28,79 --> 0:39:31,297
And this is that we shouldn't
view language learning as


651
0:39:31,297 --> 0:39:34,23
learning at all.
Instead, we should view it as


652
0:39:34,23 --> 0:39:37,19
something similar to growth.
So he says, 


653
0:39:37,19 --> 0:39:39,88
No one would take
seriously the proposal that a


654
0:39:39,88 --> 0:39:42,933
human organism learns through
experience to have arms rather


655
0:39:42,933 --> 0:39:45,138
than wings,
or that the basic structure of


656
0:39:45,138 --> 0:39:47,71
particular organs results from
accidental experience.


657
0:39:47,71 --> 0:39:49,641
[Language]
proves to be no less marvelous


658
0:39:49,641 --> 0:39:51,909
and intricate than these
physical structures.


659
0:39:51,909 --> 0:39:55,329
Why, then, should we not study
the acquisition of a cognitive


660
0:39:55,329 --> 0:39:58,749
structure like language more or
less as we study some complex


661
0:39:58,749 --> 0:40:1,775
bodily organ?
So, you might learn to play


662
0:40:1,775 --> 0:40:5,205
baseball, you might learn about
the American Civil War,


663
0:40:5,205 --> 0:40:9,79
but if Chomsky is right you
didn't learn to speak English.


664
0:40:9,79 --> 0:40:12,85
Rather, what happened is you
heard English and--but the


665
0:40:12,85 --> 0:40:17,109
capacity grew in your head and
something a lot more similar to


666
0:40:17,109 --> 0:40:20,95
the development of arms or legs
or a visual system.


667
0:40:20,95 --> 0:40:25,559
Well, should we believe this?
We know there has to be some


668
0:40:25,559 --> 0:40:28,828
effect of the environment
shaping language,


669
0:40:28,828 --> 0:40:31,107
obviously,
because in order to know


670
0:40:31,107 --> 0:40:34,329
English you have to have heard
English, in order to know Dutch


671
0:40:34,329 --> 0:40:37,884
you have had to heard,
to--had to have learned and


672
0:40:37,884 --> 0:40:39,569
heard Dutch.
And in fact,


673
0:40:39,569 --> 0:40:42,67
languages differ in all the
ways that we were talking about.


674
0:40:42,67 --> 0:40:46,708
Some languages like English has
a--have a distinction between


675
0:40:46,708 --> 0:40:49,44
‘l' and ‘r.'
Other languages do not.


676
0:40:49,44 --> 0:40:53,898
For a language like English,
that creature there is referred


677
0:40:53,898 --> 0:40:57,655
to with the morpheme "dog."
That's a historical accident of


678
0:40:57,655 --> 0:41:1,855
English.
In French it's chien and


679
0:41:1,855 --> 0:41:6,615
in Greek it's something else.
And each of those 6,000


680
0:41:6,615 --> 0:41:9,724
languages and people in the room
who know another language would


681
0:41:9,724 --> 0:41:11,539
say,
"Yeah, in Vietnamese it's


682
0:41:11,539 --> 0:41:14,48
this," "In Urdu it's this," "In
Czech it's that."


683
0:41:14,48 --> 0:41:19,76
Finally, there is syntax.
So, English is what's known as


684
0:41:19,76 --> 0:41:24,292
a subject-verb-object language.
That means if you want to


685
0:41:24,292 --> 0:41:28,217
convey the idea that Bill hit
John, you would say,


686
0:41:28,217 --> 0:41:32,99
"Bill hit John."
But not all languages work that


687
0:41:32,99 --> 0:41:34,139
way.
In fact, the majority of


688
0:41:34,139 --> 0:41:36,767
languages, more languages,
are actually


689
0:41:36,767 --> 0:41:40,338
subject-object-verb languages.
So, you would say,


690
0:41:40,338 --> 0:41:44,632
if you wanted to convey that
Bill was the hitter and John was


691
0:41:44,632 --> 0:41:48,26
hit, "Bill John hit."
All of this has to be learned.


692
0:41:48,26 --> 0:41:51,756
And all of this has to be
learned through exposure to


693
0:41:51,756 --> 0:41:54,499
language users.
On the other hand,


694
0:41:54,499 --> 0:41:59,741
there is considerable evidence
that the development of these


695
0:41:59,741 --> 0:42:2,814
language skills,
in some way,


696
0:42:2,814 --> 0:42:9,159
is similar to growth in the way
that Chomsky suggests.


697
0:42:9,159 --> 0:42:12,469
So, here are some basic facts
about language development.


698
0:42:12,469 --> 0:42:15,39
One is something which I had
mentioned before.


699
0:42:15,39 --> 0:42:21,92
All normal children learn
language.


700
0:42:21,92 --> 0:42:25,19
There can be specific
impairments of language.


701
0:42:25,19 --> 0:42:28,11
Now, again, we spoke about them
before when talking about the


702
0:42:28,11 --> 0:42:30,845
brain.
Some of these impairments could


703
0:42:30,845 --> 0:42:33,36
be due to trauma,
the aphasias.


704
0:42:33,36 --> 0:42:38,159
Trauma, a blow to the head,
a stroke can rid you of your


705
0:42:38,159 --> 0:42:40,947
language.
But, also, there are genetic


706
0:42:40,947 --> 0:42:44,731
disorders, some falling under
the rubric of what's known as


707
0:42:44,731 --> 0:42:49,889
"specific language impairment,"
where children are born without


708
0:42:49,889 --> 0:42:55,1
the same ability as the rest of
us to learn to speak.


709
0:42:55,1 --> 0:42:58,13
And these are interesting in
many ways.


710
0:42:58,13 --> 0:43:1,347
One reason that they're
interesting is that they


711
0:43:1,347 --> 0:43:4,36
illustrate something about human
language.


712
0:43:4,36 --> 0:43:8,101
It is not--It would not be
unreasonable for you to think


713
0:43:8,101 --> 0:43:10,889
before listening to his lecture,
"Look.


714
0:43:10,889 --> 0:43:14,974
All you need to have to learn a
language is to be smart" or "All


715
0:43:14,974 --> 0:43:18,151
you need to have to learn a
language is to want to


716
0:43:18,151 --> 0:43:22,171
communicate" or "All you need to
have to learn a language is to


717
0:43:22,171 --> 0:43:25,477
be a social person wanting
to--having the ability to


718
0:43:25,477 --> 0:43:28,59
understand others and deal with
others."


719
0:43:28,59 --> 0:43:32,208
But the cases of specific
language impairments suggest


720
0:43:32,208 --> 0:43:36,336
that all of that is wrong,
because there are children in


721
0:43:36,336 --> 0:43:39,47
this world right now who are
plenty smart,


722
0:43:39,47 --> 0:43:44,682
who really want to communicate,
and who are entirely social


723
0:43:44,682 --> 0:43:48,65
creatures but they can't learn
language.


724
0:43:48,65 --> 0:43:52,522
And this suggests that the
ability to learn language and


725
0:43:52,522 --> 0:43:56,888
understand language is to some
extent separate from these other


726
0:43:56,888 --> 0:44:0,763
aspects of mental life.
Continuing on this theme,


727
0:44:0,763 --> 0:44:5,105
we also know that language is
learnt without any sort of


728
0:44:5,105 --> 0:44:8,917
feedback or training.
There are many Americans who


729
0:44:8,917 --> 0:44:12,82
believe that they need to teach
their children language.


730
0:44:12,82 --> 0:44:16,151
And there's a huge industry
with DVDs and flash cards and


731
0:44:16,151 --> 0:44:19,9
all sorts of things designed to
teach your children language.


732
0:44:19,9 --> 0:44:22,392
And I think many parents
believe that if they didn't


733
0:44:22,392 --> 0:44:25,374
persist in using these things
their children would never learn


734
0:44:25,374 --> 0:44:28,112
to speak.
But we know that that's not


735
0:44:28,112 --> 0:44:30,82
true.
We know that this isn't true


736
0:44:30,82 --> 0:44:35,619
because there are communities
where they don't speak to their


737
0:44:35,619 --> 0:44:37,772
kids.
They don't speak to their kids


738
0:44:37,772 --> 0:44:40,696
because they don't believe it's
important to speak to their


739
0:44:40,696 --> 0:44:42,348
kids.
Some linguists would


740
0:44:42,348 --> 0:44:45,532
interview--Linguists would
interview adults in these


741
0:44:45,532 --> 0:44:48,528
communities and say,
"Why don't you speak to your


742
0:44:48,528 --> 0:44:51,523
babies?"
And these adults would respond,


743
0:44:51,523 --> 0:44:54,34
"It'd be ridiculous to speak to
a baby.


744
0:44:54,34 --> 0:44:58,562
The baby has nothing to say.
You might as well just speak to


745
0:44:58,562 --> 0:45:0,687
your dog."
And then the American linguist


746
0:45:0,687 --> 0:45:5,469
would say, "Yeah.
We speak to our dogs."


747
0:45:5,469 --> 0:45:7,629
[laughter]
Americans and Europeans speak


748
0:45:7,629 --> 0:45:10,96
to everything and everybody.
Other cultures are more picky


749
0:45:10,96 --> 0:45:14,242
and they don't talk to their
children until their children


750
0:45:14,242 --> 0:45:17,694
themselves are talking.
This doesn't seem to make much


751
0:45:17,694 --> 0:45:20,17
of a difference in language
learning.


752
0:45:20,17 --> 0:45:24,188
Some studies have,
motivated by Chomsky's work in


753
0:45:24,188 --> 0:45:28,206
expressed--sorry,
motivated by Chomsky's critique


754
0:45:28,206 --> 0:45:33,137
of Skinner's Verbal Behavior,
 have asked even in-- "What


755
0:45:33,137 --> 0:45:36,599
if we just looked at children
within the United States?


756
0:45:36,599 --> 0:45:39,83
Don't these children get
feedback?"


757
0:45:39,83 --> 0:45:45,628
And the answer is yes and no.
So your average highly educated


758
0:45:45,628 --> 0:45:50,425
Western parent does give their
children feedback--do give their


759
0:45:50,425 --> 0:45:53,829
children feedback based on what
they say.


760
0:45:53,829 --> 0:45:58,961
But they don't typically give
feedback based on the syntax or


761
0:45:58,961 --> 0:46:3,73
grammaticality of what they say.
The example given by Brown and


762
0:46:3,73 --> 0:46:7,326
Hanlon in the classic study in
the 1970s is they did all of


763
0:46:7,326 --> 0:46:10,86
these studies looking at what
children say and how parents


764
0:46:10,86 --> 0:46:13,859
responded,
and it turns out parents


765
0:46:13,859 --> 0:46:19,205
respond not to the grammatical
correctness but to the affect or


766
0:46:19,205 --> 0:46:23,0
cuteness or sociability of the
utterance.


767
0:46:23,0 --> 0:46:26,32
So for instance,
if a child says to his mother,


768
0:46:26,32 --> 0:46:28,668
"I loves you,
Mommy," it's a very unusual


769
0:46:28,668 --> 0:46:30,91
parent who would say,
"Oh, no.


770
0:46:30,91 --> 0:46:34,82
The verb agreement is mistaken.
[laughter]


771
0:46:34,82 --> 0:46:38,719
You've added a redundant ‘s.'
It's not appropriate."


772
0:46:38,719 --> 0:46:42,171
Similarly, if a child is to
say, "I hate your guts,


773
0:46:42,171 --> 0:46:45,83
Mother," it's an unusual
mother, "That's wonderful.


774
0:46:45,83 --> 0:46:48,852
There's a subject, verb, object.
The whole thing's structurally


775
0:46:48,852 --> 0:46:51,4
fine."
We respond to our kids like we


776
0:46:51,4 --> 0:46:54,396
respond to each other based on
the message that's conveyed,


777
0:46:54,396 --> 0:46:56,969
not the grammaticality of the
utterances.


778
0:46:56,969 --> 0:47:0,794
Children make grammatical
mistakes all the time but then


779
0:47:0,794 --> 0:47:4,34
they go away and they go away
without correction.


780
0:47:4,34 --> 0:47:9,143
So those are some basic facts.
What do we know about the time


781
0:47:9,143 --> 0:47:13,354
course of language?
Well, early on children start


782
0:47:13,354 --> 0:47:18,26
off and they prefer the melody
of their own language.


783
0:47:18,26 --> 0:47:23,389
These studies were done in
France with four-day-old babies.


784
0:47:23,389 --> 0:47:26,639
And what they did was they used
a sucking method.


785
0:47:26,639 --> 0:47:28,86
Remember, there's a limited
number of things babies can do.


786
0:47:28,86 --> 0:47:32,559
One of the things they can do
is suck, and these babies would


787
0:47:32,559 --> 0:47:34,78
suck on a pacifier to hear
French.


788
0:47:34,78 --> 0:47:41,119
And they would prefer to hear
French than to hear Russian.


789
0:47:41,119 --> 0:47:45,391
And these investigators claimed
this is because they had been


790
0:47:45,391 --> 0:47:49,519
exposed to French in the first
four days of their lives.


791
0:47:49,519 --> 0:47:53,395
Reviewers, mostly from France,
objected and said,


792
0:47:53,395 --> 0:47:55,429
"No.
Maybe French just sounds better.


793
0:47:55,429 --> 0:47:57,84
Everybody's going to like
French."


794
0:47:57,84 --> 0:48:0,239
So, they re-did the study in
Russia.


795
0:48:0,239 --> 0:48:3,893
Russian kids sucked harder to
hear Russian than they did to


796
0:48:3,893 --> 0:48:6,263
French.
And what they're listening to


797
0:48:6,263 --> 0:48:8,38
isn't the words.
They don't know words yet.


798
0:48:8,38 --> 0:48:11,539
They don't know of syntax yet.
It's the rhythm of the language.


799
0:48:11,539 --> 0:48:14,57
For you, French and Russian
sound different.


800
0:48:14,57 --> 0:48:17,123
Even if you're like me and you
don't know a word of either


801
0:48:17,123 --> 0:48:18,869
language, they still sound
different.


802
0:48:18,869 --> 0:48:22,79
They sound different to babies
too.


803
0:48:22,79 --> 0:48:27,295
And a baby being raised in
France or a baby being raised in


804
0:48:27,295 --> 0:48:32,24
Russia knows enough to tell
what's his language and what


805
0:48:32,24 --> 0:48:35,738
isn't.
Early on, children are


806
0:48:35,738 --> 0:48:40,11
sensitive to every phoneme there
is.


807
0:48:40,11 --> 0:48:42,898
So, English-speaking children,
for instance,


808
0:48:42,898 --> 0:48:46,66
can--English-speaking babies
– babies who are born in the


809
0:48:46,66 --> 0:48:49,773
United States – can
distinguish between English


810
0:48:49,773 --> 0:48:53,665
phonemes like "lip" and "rip"
but they could also distinguish


811
0:48:53,665 --> 0:48:58,269
between phonemic contrasts that
are not exemplified in English,


812
0:48:58,269 --> 0:49:0,92
such as phonemic contrasts in
Czech or Hindi.


813
0:49:0,92 --> 0:49:2,379
Yes.
Student:


814
0:49:2,379 --> 0:49:6,35
I'm wondering if you can say
the wrong things to them--to


815
0:49:6,35 --> 0:49:9,17
infants based on what you were
saying before.


816
0:49:9,17 --> 0:49:11,542
Because I was in France one
summer and I had some neighbors


817
0:49:11,542 --> 0:49:13,61
there.
I hated these neighbors,


818
0:49:13,61 --> 0:49:18,906
I thought they were stupid.
Not because they were French,


819
0:49:18,906 --> 0:49:25,1
but they had a baby and it
would gaggle and coo and they


820
0:49:25,1 --> 0:49:30,96
would respond in similar terms.
Professor Paul Bloom:


821
0:49:30,96 --> 0:49:31,929
They would gaggle and coo back
at the baby.


822
0:49:31,929 --> 0:49:34,21
Student: [inaudible]
And I hate these people.


823
0:49:34,21 --> 0:49:40,737
[inaudible]
So I don't know if it--Does it


824
0:49:40,737 --> 0:49:50,449
matter what you say to babies as
long as you say something.


825
0:49:50,449 --> 0:49:54,51
Professor Paul Bloom:
There's a lot going on in your


826
0:49:54,51 --> 0:49:55,722
question.
[laughter]


827
0:49:55,722 --> 0:49:57,889
Some raising--Well,
there's a lot going on in your


828
0:49:57,889 --> 0:50:0,166
question.
The answer to the question--


829
0:50:0,166 --> 0:50:3,34
The question was,
"your baby's going to coo and


830
0:50:3,34 --> 0:50:6,402
'ga ga, goo goo,' does it matter
if you coo and 'ga ga,


831
0:50:6,402 --> 0:50:8,687
goo goo' back?"
No, it doesn't make a


832
0:50:8,687 --> 0:50:11,929
difference.
Your hatred towards them was


833
0:50:11,929 --> 0:50:15,89
unmotivated.
You can be relieved of that


834
0:50:15,89 --> 0:50:18,59
debt, or now you know you feel
bad now, I guess.


835
0:50:18,59 --> 0:50:22,4
[laughter]
If you speak to your children


836
0:50:22,4 --> 0:50:25,579
in perfect English,
it's very strange.


837
0:50:25,579 --> 0:50:28,17
Nobody speaks to their babies
in, "Hello, Son.


838
0:50:28,17 --> 0:50:31,364
It's time--Oh.
You want to change your diaper


839
0:50:31,364 --> 0:50:34,9
right now so stay still."
That's bad parenting.


840
0:50:34,9 --> 0:50:36,379
It sounds kind of silly.
More--What most people do is,


841
0:50:36,379 --> 0:50:38,0
"Oh.
You're such a cute little baby."


842
0:50:38,0 --> 0:50:41,612
And it probably--One--T
here's--Evolutionary


843
0:50:41,612 --> 0:50:46,315
psychologists debate the
function of why we talk funny to


844
0:50:46,315 --> 0:50:48,863
babies.
And some people have argued


845
0:50:48,863 --> 0:50:51,449
that it does help their language
learning.


846
0:50:51,449 --> 0:50:55,85
And some people have argued
instead that what it does is it


847
0:50:55,85 --> 0:50:57,855
calms them.
They like to hear the music of


848
0:50:57,855 --> 0:51:1,83
a smooth voice and so on.
But whether or not you do so


849
0:51:1,83 --> 0:51:3,219
doesn't seem to make a big
difference.


850
0:51:3,219 --> 0:51:7,44
It is very difficult to find
any effect of how parents talk


851
0:51:7,44 --> 0:51:10,786
to their kids on how their kids
learn language,


852
0:51:10,786 --> 0:51:13,769
particularly when it comes to
babies.


853
0:51:13,769 --> 0:51:19,498
So, early on babies can--are
sensitive to all phonemes and


854
0:51:19,498 --> 0:51:23,202
then that goes away.
Around twelve months of age it


855
0:51:23,202 --> 0:51:26,144
goes away.
This is one thing you were much


856
0:51:26,144 --> 0:51:29,929
better at when you were a baby
than you are now.


857
0:51:29,929 --> 0:51:33,329
When you were a baby you were a
multilingual fool.


858
0:51:33,329 --> 0:51:38,989
You could understand the sound
differences of every language on


859
0:51:38,989 --> 0:51:41,18
earth.
Now, if you're like me,


860
0:51:41,18 --> 0:51:43,53
you could barely understand
English.


861
0:51:43,53 --> 0:51:46,313
[laughter]
You narrow down until you're


862
0:51:46,313 --> 0:51:49,389
sensitive just to the language
you hear.


863
0:51:49,389 --> 0:51:55,95
And this narrowing down is
largely in place by about twelve


864
0:51:55,95 --> 0:51:59,71
months of age.
Around seven months is babbling.


865
0:51:59,71 --> 0:52:4,396
And I want to stop at this
point to go back to the issue--I


866
0:52:4,396 --> 0:52:9,325
promised you I would turn a bit
to sign language and I want to


867
0:52:9,325 --> 0:52:14,174
describe now a very elegant--I
want to show a little film now


868
0:52:14,174 --> 0:52:18,457
of a very elegant series of
experiments looking at the


869
0:52:18,457 --> 0:52:23,386
question of whether babies who
are exposed to a sign language,


870
0:52:23,386 --> 0:52:26,862
babble.
One of the real surprising


871
0:52:26,862 --> 0:52:31,634
findings in my field over the
last ten/twenty years has been


872
0:52:31,634 --> 0:52:36,324
that the acquisition of sign
languages has turned out to be


873
0:52:36,324 --> 0:52:40,84
almost exactly the same;
in fact, as far as we know,


874
0:52:40,84 --> 0:52:43,7
exactly the same as the
acquisition of spoken languages.


875
0:52:43,7 --> 0:52:46,498
It didn't have to be that way.
It could have been just as


876
0:52:46,498 --> 0:52:50,175
reasonable to expect that
there'd be an advantage for


877
0:52:50,175 --> 0:52:53,175
speech over sign.
That sign languages may be


878
0:52:53,175 --> 0:52:56,773
full-blown languages but they
just take--they're just harder


879
0:52:56,773 --> 0:53:0,128
to learn because the brain and
the body have adapted for


880
0:53:0,128 --> 0:53:2,26
speech.
It turns out that this just


881
0:53:2,26 --> 0:53:5,69
isn't the case.
It turns out that sign and--the


882
0:53:5,69 --> 0:53:9,91
developmental milestones of sign
languages and the developmental


883
0:53:9,91 --> 0:53:12,73
milestones of spoken languages
are precisely the same.


884
0:53:12,73 --> 0:53:14,53
They start babbling at the same
point.


885
0:53:14,53 --> 0:53:17,64
They start using first words,
first sentences,


886
0:53:17,64 --> 0:53:19,989
first complicated
constructions.


887
0:53:19,989 --> 0:53:23,385
There seems to be no
interesting difference between


888
0:53:23,385 --> 0:53:27,256
how the brain comes to acquire
and use the spoken language


889
0:53:27,256 --> 0:53:31,564
versus a sign language.
Around twelve months of age,


890
0:53:31,564 --> 0:53:35,99
children start using their
first words.


891
0:53:35,99 --> 0:53:41,396
These are words for objects and
actions like "dog" and "up" and


892
0:53:41,396 --> 0:53:44,201
"milk."
They start showing some


893
0:53:44,201 --> 0:53:47,79
sensitivity to the order of
words.


894
0:53:47,79 --> 0:53:53,178
So they know that "dog bites
cat" is different from "cat


895
0:53:53,178 --> 0:53:56,209
bites dog."
Around eighteen months of age,


896
0:53:56,209 --> 0:53:58,1
they start learning words
faster.


897
0:53:58,1 --> 0:54:2,895
They start producing little,
miniature sentences like "Want


898
0:54:2,895 --> 0:54:7,36
cookie" or "Milk spill" and the
function morphemes,


899
0:54:7,36 --> 0:54:10,179
the little words,
"in," "of," "a," "the," and so


900
0:54:10,179 --> 0:54:12,4
on start to gradually appear.


901
0:54:12,4 --> 0:54:15,84



902
0:54:15,84 --> 0:54:17,929
Then the--Then there's the bad
news.


903
0:54:17,929 --> 0:54:22,21
Around seven years of age going
up through puberty,


904
0:54:22,21 --> 0:54:26,489
the ability to learn language
starts to go away.


905
0:54:26,489 --> 0:54:31,542
The best work on this has been
done by Elissa Newport and Sam


906
0:54:31,542 --> 0:54:36,425
Supalla who have studied people
who have been in the United


907
0:54:36,425 --> 0:54:40,419
States for many,
many years – 30,40 years –


908
0:54:40,419 --> 0:54:44,5
and seeing how well they have
come to speak English.


909
0:54:44,5 --> 0:54:47,35
And it turns out the big
determinant of how well you


910
0:54:47,35 --> 0:54:50,48
speak English as an immigrant
isn't how smart you are.


911
0:54:50,48 --> 0:54:53,238
It's not how many family
members you have when you're


912
0:54:53,238 --> 0:54:55,46
here.
It's not your motivation.


913
0:54:55,46 --> 0:54:58,53
It's how old you were when you
started.


914
0:54:58,53 --> 0:55:2,418
It turns out that if you start
learning a language – a second


915
0:55:2,418 --> 0:55:6,181
language is where most of the
work's been done – within the


916
0:55:6,181 --> 0:55:8,69
first few years of life you're
fine.


917
0:55:8,69 --> 0:55:13,27
You'll speak like a native.
But then it starts getting


918
0:55:13,27 --> 0:55:16,227
worse and worse.
And once you hit puberty,


919
0:55:16,227 --> 0:55:20,635
suddenly there's huge variation
in the abilities you have to


920
0:55:20,635 --> 0:55:22,929
learn language.
It is very rare,


921
0:55:22,929 --> 0:55:25,363
for instance,
for somebody who has learned


922
0:55:25,363 --> 0:55:28,389
English past puberty to speak
without an accent.


923
0:55:28,389 --> 0:55:31,53
An accent is very hard to shake
and it's not just an accent.


924
0:55:31,53 --> 0:55:35,677
It's also other aspects of
phonology, syntax,


925
0:55:35,677 --> 0:55:39,569
and morphology.
It's like the part of the brain


926
0:55:39,569 --> 0:55:44,222
that's responsible for language
learning is only around early in


927
0:55:44,222 --> 0:55:48,949
development and if you don't get
your language by then it'll just


928
0:55:48,949 --> 0:55:53,616
run out.
I want to begin next class with


929
0:55:53,616 --> 0:55:58,4
this question,
the question of animals.


930
0:55:58,4 --> 0:56:1,3
And that will shut down the
language learning part.


931
0:56:1,3 --> 0:56:10,199
But one thing I'll put up here
is your second reading response.


932
0:56:10,199 --> 0:56:13,353
So, I'll also put this up on
Wednesday, and by Wednesday you


933
0:56:13,353 --> 0:56:16,667
might have a bit of a better--be
in a better position to answer


934
0:56:16,667 --> 0:56:19,335
this question.
But I'll continue with language


935
0:56:19,335 --> 0:56:22,85
on Wednesday and then we'll also
talk about vision,


936
0:56:22,85 --> 0:56:30,0
attention, and memory.
I'll see you then.


937
0:56:30,0 --> 0:58:30,0
