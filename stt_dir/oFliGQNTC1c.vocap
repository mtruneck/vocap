###11 DAVID CHOE: China's a huge place.
###12 The landscape keeps changing.
###14 It goes from vast canyons to sand dunes to, like, these
###18 desolate zombie towns, where there's huge complexes where
###22 there's just no people living there.
###24 Things like that, they make you think about
###26 your position in life.
###27 We go into these towns and these worker bees, these
###29 people are working for pennies doing these huge
###31 construction projects.
###32 I mean, it makes me think about shit.
###34 It's like, I spill paint on these expensive rugs and then
###37 sell it for shitloads of money.
###38 And if I was born in this shithole town and I had to
###42 paint that whole thing and I spilled a drop of paint, then
###44 I'd get fired.
###46 It's fucking crazy.
###48 It's life circumstance.
###49 
###52 But I don't know.
###56 Hopefully life on the road, us expressing ourselves through
###62 dance and music and hitchhiking, maybe we'll start
###66 some kind of a revolution.
###67 But probably not.
###69 Let's go.
###71 So we're outside of a town called Xi'an.
###74 It's our next biggest city.
###75 There's a bus.
###77 We're just going to get on.
###78 I guess we're just going to get on.
###80 
###84 [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###86 
###93 DAVID CHOE: Let Homegirl know we don't have any money.
###95 [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###96 
###101 DAVID CHOE: We're drifters.
###102 [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###103 
###108 DAVID CHOE: We inherently don't pay for rides.
###112 It's against the religion of the road.
###114 No money.
###116 
###119 I got a jizz tissue and some dust.
###124 We got to get off?
###126 So mean.
###129 OK, OK.
###129 Shit.
###130 Moving.
###131 
###133 You're very cute, you know, in this life.
###136 
###140 [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###141 
###144 DAVID CHOE: All right.
###145 So they were kind enough.
###147 That was a 10-cent ride.
###148 I guess we could have fucking faked it and paid for it.
###150 But sort of goes against my religion.
###153 It goes against everything we believe in at Thumbs Up.
###157 And then--
###159 Look at this.
###160 Jump-- let's go.
###163 Get in.
###164 Jump in.
###165 Squeeze in.
###167 Yeah!
###169 Hi.
###169 Hello.
###170 [CHINESE].
###171 What are your names?
###172 What are your names?
###172 [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###175 DAVID CHOE: Jiang Ho.
###176 FEMALE SPEAKER: Jiang Ho.
###176 DAVID CHOE: What up, Jiang Ho?
###177 FEMALE SPEAKER: Jiang Ho, what's up, what's up?
###179 DAVID CHOE: What's up?
###180 [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###181 
###185 DAVID CHOE: Hey, ask him if he knows Street Fighter, the
###186 video game.
###187 Street Fighter.
###188 [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###188 DAVID CHOE: Chun Li.
###189 [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###191 
###197 DAVID CHOE: Does he know Chun Li from Street Fighter?
###198 [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###200 
###202 DAVID CHOE: All right.
###203 All right.
###204 Thank you.
###204 [CHINESE].
###205 [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###206 
###210 DAVID CHOE: I've often wondered why Chun Li from
###213 Street Fighter had huge thighs.
###214 
###217 Every time I got to take a dump, I got to squat like
###219 this, because all the toilets are squatter-style.
###222 But the chicks, they got to squat every time they got to
###225 pee or shit.
###227 They get the hugest hamstrings and calves.
###230 
###235 [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###236 
###243 DAVID CHOE: Yeah, yeah, yeah, all right.
###244 HARRY KIM: All right.
###245 DAVID CHOE: Party.
###246 HARRY KIM: Yay.
###247 DAVID CHOE: Party, party, party, party.
###248 [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###250 DAVID CHOE: Give us a ride, dude.
###251 Be cool.
###252 Be cool.
###253 [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###254 DAVID CHOE: Whether you give us a ride or you don't give us
###255 a ride, it'll never change the fact--
###257 [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###258 DAVID CHOE: --what a handsome devil you are.
###259 [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###260 
###264 FEMALE SPEAKER: Ah, come on.
###265 Come on.
###265 Come on.
###265 DAVID CHOE: Yeah, yeah?
###266 FEMALE SPEAKER: Come on.
###266 Come on.
###266 Get in.
###266 Get in.
###267 Get in.
###267 Get in.
###268 DAVID CHOE: Yeah, yeah.
###268 You, sir, are a handsome devil.
###270 I like you.
###271 Yeah!
###272 [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###274 DAVID CHOE: Look at that smile.
###276 I want to fucking kiss you right now, man.
###278 FEMALE SPEAKER: Kiss him.
###279 Kiss him.
###279 DAVID CHOE: No, you kiss him.
###280 I'm not going to kiss him.
###281 [LAUGHTER]
###284 You're the best.
###285 One, two, three.
###286 Go!
###287 [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###289 DAVID CHOE: Yeah.
###290 [EXCITING ROCK MUSIC PLAYING]
###300 DAVID CHOE: We're in Xi'an.
###301 It's our first big city after Beijing.
###303 I got the shits.
###304 Had to take a dump, and I had a accident on my shirt.
###310 We came out.
###312 These guys looked pretty cool and hip.
###314 The dude with the orange hair, he looks like a freak, so we
###317 just sat down and ate with them.
###317 We had a delicious meal.
###319 It turns out they're punk rockers.
###321 They're in a rock band called Echo Rush.
###325 We're giving them massages right now.
###327 They're going to go out and party tonight.
###328 So you guys ready to rock?
###330 Yeah?
###330 All right, let's do it.
###331 Echo Rush.
###333 
###345 [PUNK MUSIC PLAYING]
###349 DAVID CHOE: I love this guy.
###351 [PUNK MUSIC PLAYING]
###358 DAVID CHOE: Yeah.
###359 [PUNK MUSIC PLAYING]
###385 DAVID CHOE: Echo Rush.
###386 We fucking rock China so hard.
###388 
###394 China!
###395 Fucking love China.
###397 I come to China, and the fucking
###399 girls have little mustaches.
###401 [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###402 
###405 DAVID CHOE: I like it.
###406 I fucking like it.
###408 I saw it, and I was fucking scared.
###411 I was scared when I saw the mustache, and now I
###413 fucking love it.
###415 Do you know how to love?
###416 Do you love, or do you fuck?
###418 MALE SPEAKER: Yes, I love.
###419 DAVID CHOE: Who do you love?
###419 What's the last name?
###420 HARRY KIM: Do you fuck?
###421 DAVID CHOE: Do you know what love is?
###422 Do you know what love is?
###423 Do you know what love is?
###424 [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###426 DAVID CHOE: You're the lead singer.
###426 You should fuck everybody.
###428 Fuck everybody.
###429 MALE SPEAKER: OK.
###430 DAVID CHOE: There's no time for love.
###431 There's no time for love.
###432 [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###434 DAVID CHOE: Don't be a bitch.
###435 Fuck everybody.
###436 [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###437 DAVID CHOE: Fuck from China all the way to Russia.
###439 MALE SPEAKER: You can help me?
###440 DAVID CHOE: I'll help you.
###441 HARRY KIM: Oh god, you can do it.
###443 DAVID CHOE: I'm not that shit, but I'll do it for this guy.
###445 All the fucking Chinese bitches with mustaches, I'll
###448 fuck them all.
###450 I love this guy.
###451 
###456 [COUGHING]
###457 DAVID CHOE: That's not water.
###458 FEMALE SPEAKER: I'll be right back, OK?
###460 
###462 DAVID CHOE: So we're still in Xi'an.
###464 It's a city that's known for the Terracotta Warriors.
###467 And this guy, I can't travel with this guy if he looks like
###473 shit all the time.
###474 So we're going to get him a haircut right now.
###476 I don't know.
###477 There's not much we can do with it.
###478 But let's go check it out.
###480 
###483 [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###484 
###497 DAVID CHOE: Sausage party, all you can eat.
###499 That's what last night was.
###501 With the good-looking dudes in a rock band.
###503 And once again, it took Harry to show rockers how to rock.
###507 My band, KGB, Koreans Gone Bad, with my brother Harry, we
###510 formed this shit years ago.
###512 We get on stage.
###513 The guy writes a song.
###515 It goes, ching chong China, ripping a vagina.
###518 I mean, I know I get pissed at Harry sometimes.
###521 I know I yell at him.
###522 But you know what's worse in life than being mad
###524 and pissed at Harry?
###525 It's not having Harry in your life.
###527 So today I'm going to treat Harry to a day at the spa.
###530 Get a haircut.
###532 This is what you call traditional-style
###535 Chinese bowl cut.
###539 [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###540 
###545 DAVID CHOE: All right.
###545 HARRY KIM: Hey.
###546 DAVID CHOE: Look good, man.
###547 HARRY KIM: Hey.
###548 DAVID CHOE: Remember that baby we saw in that little village?
###551 We want this haircut on this guy.
###553 All right, we're going to do Harry up one up
###555 better than this one.
###557 Yeah, finish it off.
###558 [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###559 DAVID CHOE: So in the entire hair salon, Harry's getting
###562 his hair cut by the one girl that is not certified, and has
###566 never done a haircut before.
###568 We think she's the receptionist.
###570 [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###571 FEMALE SPEAKER: She's a little nervous right now.
###573 DAVID CHOE: Oh, don't be nervous.
###574 [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###576 DAVID CHOE: If you guys are bored watching this, how about
###578 we read this girl's shirt while Harry's
###581 getting his hair cut?
###582 It says--
###584 
###606 HARRY KIM: OK.
###607 Here, man.
###610 DAVID CHOE: I know Harry hasn't been picking up too
###612 much road pussy on this trip.
###614 That's all about to change after this haircut.
###616 
###622 [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###623 
###628 HARRY KIM: Oh.
###629 Hey.
###630 
###635 [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###637 
###641 DAVID CHOE: Oh, excuse me.
###642 [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###646 DAVID CHOE: Would you ever date a guy
###646 that his this style?
###649 [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###650 
###653 DAVID CHOE: You like this kind of look?
###655 No?
###655 [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###656 DAVID CHOE: The irony being, she's not into guys that have
###660 this kind of style.
###661 But the fact is, Harry would fuck her better than any
###664 fucking guy she's ever been into, better than any of them.
###668 And she'll never know that pleasure, because she's
###672 judging him.
###673 HARRY KIM: Yeah.
###674 DAVID CHOE: So I'm sorry.
###675 I'm sorry.
###678 You will never know.
###679 You will never, ever, ever know.
###681 You will never know.
###683 You will never, ever know.
###685 Sorry, Harry.
###686 I tried.
###686 HARRY KIM: It's all right.
###687 [HONKING]
###693 [SHRIEKING]
###696 [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###697 
###718 DAVID CHOE: How-how for Echo Rush, whose favorite drummer
###722 is Usher's drummer.
###723 Total sweetheart.
###724 Total cutie.
###725 He let us stay, the whole band and crew, at his grandmother's
###728 house last night.
###729 And then even better, their fucking tour
###733 driver, Jacob, aka Hong--
###736 hi.
###737 JACOB: OK, hi.
###739 DAVID CHOE: Echo Rush just finished their tour, so he's
###741 heading-- what's that city?
###742 [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###744 DAVID CHOE: I can't pronounce it.
###745 [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###748 DAVID CHOE: And it seems to be south, so he's nice enough to
###752 give us a ride.
###755 Jacob?
###755 JACOB: OK.
###756 DAVID CHOE: You're on the road a lot with these punk bands.
###759 So is it lonely on the road?
###761 [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###762 
###771 DAVID CHOE: I mean, those guys in that
###772 band were pretty young.
###773 When you're giving a ride to all these young bands, are
###775 they annoying?
###776 Do they get on your nerves?
###777 [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###778 
###792 DAVID CHOE: So since he's all over China, does he have like
###794 a girlfriend in every city?
###796 There's a lot of girls on the road?
###798 [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###799 DAVID CHOE: Road pussy.
###800 Road pussy.
###801 Jacob, you know what I said, come on, man.
###804 The girls everywhere, all over China.
###806 Road pussy.
###807 [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###810 FEMALE SPEAKER: Called Mimis.
###811 Called Mimis.
###813 DAVID CHOE: Yeah, Mimis.
###813 [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###814 DAVID CHOE: Do you have a girlfriend?
###815 Are you married?
###816 [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###817 
###829 FEMALE SPEAKER: See, they're-- he's separated right now.
###831 DAVID CHOE: Oh.
###832 [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###832 DAVID CHOE: Oh, wait.
###834 So that's very interesting.
###836 Jacob, I've been in a very long relationship myself also.
###839 But the road kills all.
###841 In the end, you can only choose one--
###844 love or the road.
###845 If you love the road, that will destroy any
###847 relationship you have.
###849 And if you choose love, you get love, but you have to stay
###852 at home and be boring.
###854 [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###856 FEMALE SPEAKER: Because that's why after five
###857 years they did separate.
###859 He chose the road.
###860 DAVID CHOE: Jacob, the road destroyed me.
###863 The road destroyed Harry.
###866 Or not us, but our love lives.
###868 But in the end, after the dust settles, we're
###872 totally gay for the road.
###874 So it doesn't matter.
###875 [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###877 FEMALE SPEAKER: He says he chooses the road as well.
###879 DAVID CHOE: Oh, yeah!
###881 JACOB: Yeah.
###882 DAVID CHOE: Yeah, dude.
###883 
###890 JACOB: Fuck you.
###891 
###895 Fuck you.
###896 [LAUGHTER]
###897 
###906 DAVID CHOE: The road is long and hard, like Harry's shit
###908 this morning.
###909 But we just got the longest ride on
###911 Thumbs Up China so far.
###913 In my experience of all my years of traveling, when you
###915 get rides like this, people either pick you up because
###920 they want you to keep telling them stories to keep them
###922 awake while they're driving, or they want to spill all
###924 their shit on you, like you're a roadside psychiatrist, and
###927 they confess all their sins.
###929 Jacob, my main man, did what few drivers
###934 usually let you do.
###934 And that is sleep.
###936 And I mean, we've done everything to offer this guy--
###940 cigarettes, Red Bull, coffee.
###942 He is a fucking driving machine.
###945 And I just wanted to ask, because we're almost to the
###947 town he's going to drop us off in, does he have any words of
###950 wisdom or advice that he would like to give to us?
###954 [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###956 
###959 FEMALE SPEAKER: He says, my good words to you are that
###962 there are beautiful bitches waiting ahead for you.
###966 DAVID CHOE: Yeah!
###968 Yeah.
###969 
###971 All right.
###972 
###976 JACOB: Fuck you.
###977 [LAUGHTER]
###980 DAVID CHOE: It's another beautiful day in China.
###982 Thumbs up, China.
###983 Thumbs up, everybody.
###985 There's more rides to be had.
###987 There's more fun to be had.
###989 Let's get the fuck out of here.
###990 
###996 Dude, we got one of the best rides we've
###998 ever got in our life.
###999 True road warrior, down for the road, ride or die shit.
###1003 Fucking Jacob.
###1004 JACOB: Fuck you.
###1005 [LAUGHTER]
###1005 DAVID CHOE: Longest ride.
###1007 Drove us out.
###1008 Think we're along the Yellow River right now.
###1011 It's pretty dirty.
###1012 I think some rare dolphin went extinct in it.
###1017 We're also spending more time out in the sun.
###1020 And I was thinking we're getting darker, and the
###1024 Chinese girls out here like pale skin, so that might be a
###1025 problem too.
###1027 We're going to cross this river right now,
###1028 head in that direction.
###1030 Thumbs up, China.
###1032 Let's keep rolling it.
###1033 
###1049 [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###1052 DAVID CHOE: Hi.
###1053 
###1057 More, more.
###1057 Oh!
###1058 Oh!
###1059 Hit that fool.
###1059 Hit him.
###1060 Oh.
###1061 Oh.
###1061 Ooh, hit that bitch.
###1063 Oh!
###1063 Oh.
###1065 I like the dude on the left.
###1067 Yo Harry, I got $100-- oh!
###1070 Fuck yeah, dude.
###1072 Oh!
###1073 
###1076 Oh.
###1078 My money's on Harry.
###1080 My money's on Harry.
###1081 Go.
###1082 Oh, come on, you pussy.
###1085 Bash that shit, dude.
###1087 Oh.
###1088 
###1091 FEMALE SPEAKER: Come on, honey.
###1092 Let me touch you.
###1093 
###1101 [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###1102 
###1106 DAVID CHOE: Are you guys in a bike gang?
###1108 [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###1109 
###1114 DAVID CHOE: Yeah?
###1115 What's the name of their gang?
###1117 [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###1118 
###1121 FEMALE SPEAKER: They don't have a name.
###1121 They just fucking roll.
###1122 They spin around.
###1124 DAVID CHOE: That's cool, man.
###1126 [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###1127 FEMALE SPEAKER: He wants to know if
###1128 we want to go somewhere.
###1129 DAVID CHOE: Yeah, of course, dude.
###1130 As far as he'll take us.
###1131 [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###1132 DAVID CHOE: Ride or die.
###1134 [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###1137 DAVID CHOE: Yeah, come on, man.
###1141 Come on, man.
###1143 Let's ride.
###1145 
###1154 [HORN HONKING]
###1156 
###1161 DAVID CHOE: Thumbs up, China.
###1162 
###1165 Harry's balls are touching his back.
###1167 My balls are touching his back.
###1169 Life doesn't get better than this.
###1171 Thumbs up, China.
###1172 
###1180 [HORN HONKING]
###1183 DAVID CHOE: Yeah.
###1184 
###1199 This is my makeshift cooking show.
###1202 I'm going to show you how to eat really healthy and
###1204 nutritious on the road.
###1207 What is that?
###1208 FEMALE SPEAKER: Baby chick.
###1209 DAVID CHOE: OK, one.
###1209 One.
###1210 Just one.
###1210 One.
###1211 One.
###1211 Some baby birds.
###1213 Little baby canaries, like Tweety Bird.
###1216 
###1220 Eat that shit, dude.
###1221 How is that?
###1222 HARRY KIM: Mmm, it's good.
###1223 DAVID CHOE: It's good?
###1223 HARRY KIM: Mm-hmm.
###1224 DAVID CHOE: How's the flavor?
###1226 HARRY KIM: A little spicy.
###1228 DAVID CHOE: It needs a little something?
###1229 HARRY KIM: It needs a little something, though.
###1231 Mm-hmm?
###1232 DAVID CHOE: You want to put something on it?
###1233 HARRY KIM: Yeah, let's put something on this thing.
###1234 DAVID CHOE: All right.
###1235 
###1237 This is the candy man.
###1239 He takes whatever you want, and he makes it into candy.
###1241 Like that Iggy Pop song.
###1243 B-52s.
###1244 (SINGING) Candy, candy, candy.
###1246 So we got these chickens.
###1247 They taste like shit.
###1249 But there's like this thing that they have in LA, like the
###1252 Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles.
###1253 It's, you got some chicken, and you got some sweetness,
###1255 some sugar.
###1257 It's that same concept.
###1258 So we got a baby little pigeons, and we're going to
###1261 caramelize them with some sugar, and have chicken bird.
###1265 This guy thinks we're a fucking moron, but we're going
###1267 to have tasty treat.
###1268 [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###1269 
###1272 DAVID CHOE: And lettuce.
###1274 Yes, yes, yes.
###1276 Lettuce.
###1276 Oh.
###1277 Oh.
###1279 Yeah.
###1279 It's crunchy on the inside, and crunchy on the outside.
###1282 [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###1282 DAVID CHOE: Crunchy crunch.
###1284 Oh!
###1285 [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###1287 DAVID CHOE: This is Chinese style, ancient Chinese style.
###1292 Fucking delicious.
###1294 Oh my god.
###1295 
###1297 All right.
###1298 
###1303 Mmm.
###1304 Mmm.
###1305 That shit is good.
###1307 
###1309 Cabbage, cabbage pops.
###1311 This is fucking real eating.
###1312 This is some gangsta shit right here.
###1314 You want one?
###1316 Want one?
###1318 Yeah.
###1320 Some gangsta shit.
###1322 This is healthy for you.
###1323 HARRY KIM: Healthy for you.
###1323 DAVID CHOE: It's delicious.
###1325 Yeah!
###1327 Dude, that's the best spinach you're ever going to eat in
###1329 your whole life.
###1330 Your dad's never going to give you spinach like that, never.
###1333 Eat that shit, dude.
###1334 
###1339 Mmm.
###1342 That's some good shit.
