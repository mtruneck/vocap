1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:0,69



2
0:0:0,69 --> 0:0:1,85
MICHEL GONDRY: It's running?


3
0:0:1,85 --> 0:0:3,305
MALE SPEAKER 1: Yeah.


4
0:0:3,305 --> 0:0:4,76
It is.


5
0:0:4,76 --> 0:0:5,73
CHARLOTTE GAINSBOURG: [LAUGH]


6
0:0:5,73 --> 0:0:7,96
MICHEL GONDRY: What
about my make up?


7
0:0:7,96 --> 0:0:9,84
I know my nose is
always shiny.


8
0:0:9,84 --> 0:0:10,9
I don't care.


9
0:0:10,9 --> 0:0:12,64
OK, also, we speak English?


10
0:0:12,64 --> 0:0:13,35
OK.


11
0:0:13,35 --> 0:0:19,41
I remember when we shot Science
of Sleep, you were


12
0:0:19,41 --> 0:0:20,99
hiding from the camera,
especially


13
0:0:20,99 --> 0:0:22,34
in the first scenes.


14
0:0:22,34 --> 0:0:24,5
And it's interesting.


15
0:0:24,5 --> 0:0:26,24
CHARLOTTE GAINSBOURG: But I
remember, I don't know, it has


16
0:0:26,24 --> 0:0:29,74
nothing to do with this, but I
remember, I must have been


17
0:0:29,74 --> 0:0:36,14
used to so many years of hiding
because I was on my


18
0:0:36,14 --> 0:0:42,0
mother's sets when she was
acting, and just hiding to


19
0:0:42,0 --> 0:0:42,95
look at the scene.


20
0:0:42,95 --> 0:0:47,26
So I was in this position of
trying to find the place where


21
0:0:47,26 --> 0:0:53,39
nobody would say, go away and
just being like a mouse.


22
0:0:53,39 --> 0:0:57,96
And spying on the scenes
and loving it.


23
0:0:57,96 --> 0:1:2,96
And then suddenly, when I was, I
don't know, 12 when I did my


24
0:1:2,96 --> 0:1:7,75
first film, I remember hearing
people say, move away.


25
0:1:7,75 --> 0:1:9,72
And I always thought
it was me.


26
0:1:9,72 --> 0:1:10,62
MICHEL GONDRY: [LAUGH]


27
0:1:10,62 --> 0:1:12,23
CHARLOTTE GAINSBOURG: And no,
this time it wasn't me.


28
0:1:12,23 --> 0:1:14,6
MICHEL GONDRY: That's great.


29
0:1:14,6 --> 0:1:16,47
Actually, I had the same
feeling with Mos Def.


30
0:1:16,47 --> 0:1:21,44
Mos Def, he is so oblivious of
the camera, that he would


31
0:1:21,44 --> 0:1:24,42
always end up to have his back
like blocking the view.


32
0:1:24,42 --> 0:1:26,88
Sometimes I just have to
ask him to go away.


33
0:1:26,88 --> 0:1:29,85
At least, if you don't want to
be in the show, don't stop the


34
0:1:29,85 --> 0:1:31,7
others from being in the shot.


35
0:1:31,7 --> 0:1:34,32
But I have to say,
in counterparty,


36
0:1:34,32 --> 0:1:35,63
he has a great presence.


37
0:1:35,63 --> 0:1:36,65
Because he's not--


38
0:1:36,65 --> 0:1:38,99
if you put the camera here, he's
not going to feel that


39
0:1:38,99 --> 0:1:40,3
the camera. is there.


40
0:1:40,3 --> 0:1:42,0
And I think you have
this quality too.


41
0:1:42,0 --> 0:1:46,73
That you can be scrutinized by
the camera, or I guess, the


42
0:1:46,73 --> 0:1:49,72
microphone or whatever.


43
0:1:49,72 --> 0:1:51,6
And it doesn't feel you're


44
0:1:51,6 --> 0:1:54,19
communicating with this equipment.


45
0:1:54,19 --> 0:1:56,78
You're still communicating
with the other


46
0:1:56,78 --> 0:1:58,41
person or the audience.


47
0:1:58,41 --> 0:2:0,12
But a lot of peoples have--


48
0:2:0,12 --> 0:2:3,2
to me I see that as, they
have a little eye


49
0:2:3,2 --> 0:2:4,38
inside of their eye.


50
0:2:4,38 --> 0:2:7,91
So if, for instance, if I look
at you and I'm aware that the


51
0:2:7,91 --> 0:2:10,509
camera is here, I'm not
really looking at you.


52
0:2:10,509 --> 0:2:13,77
In fact, I'm looking at the
camera here to make sure the


53
0:2:13,77 --> 0:2:14,67
camera looks at me.


54
0:2:14,67 --> 0:2:17,29
And a lot of actors
have this problem.


55
0:2:17,29 --> 0:2:21,9
It's very hard because you
want to help them to be


56
0:2:21,9 --> 0:2:24,95
communicating with the person,
to create the moment.


57
0:2:24,95 --> 0:2:27,16
But they have little eyes in the
white of their eye that is


58
0:2:27,16 --> 0:2:29,52
looking to the camera,
and it's horrible.


59
0:2:29,52 --> 0:2:34,63
You coming from, probably, the
most famous couple from this


60
0:2:34,63 --> 0:2:37,66
era in France?


61
0:2:37,66 --> 0:2:40,17
CHARLOTTE GAINSBOURG: Yeah,
because I was young when I


62
0:2:40,17 --> 0:2:45,56
started, I didn't think,
ooh, I have to be as


63
0:2:45,56 --> 0:2:46,81
good as them, or--


64
0:2:46,81 --> 0:2:49,736



65
0:2:49,736 --> 0:2:52,62
I was just having fun
with the films.


66
0:2:52,62 --> 0:2:56,66
And with the album,
I did think--


67
0:2:56,66 --> 0:3:2,3
I was preoccupied, yeah.


68
0:3:2,3 --> 0:3:6,43
And that's why I chose to do it
in English, was because I


69
0:3:6,43 --> 0:3:11,74
didn't want myself to be able to
compare the words with what


70
0:3:11,74 --> 0:3:14,5
he had written.


71
0:3:14,5 --> 0:3:18,9
Because it was too
strong for me.


72
0:3:18,9 --> 0:3:20,853
MICHEL GONDRY: Using the foreign
language, it's a very


73
0:3:20,853 --> 0:3:22,72
good help for this kind of--


74
0:3:22,72 --> 0:3:26,14
CHARLOTTE GAINSBOURG: It was
easier for me, much easier.


75
0:3:26,14 --> 0:3:30,14
Because I remember, I tried
to write, and it was so


76
0:3:30,14 --> 0:3:33,69
dreadful, in French.


77
0:3:33,69 --> 0:3:36,73
And I read stuff.


78
0:3:36,73 --> 0:3:42,85
And maybe I could've read
a masterpiece, I


79
0:3:42,85 --> 0:3:44,2
wouldn't have seen it.


80
0:3:44,2 --> 0:3:46,89
I was just pushing
everything away.


81
0:3:46,89 --> 0:3:48,26
MICHEL GONDRY: Yeah, there's too
much things interfering.


82
0:3:48,26 --> 0:3:49,62
CHARLOTTE GAINSBOURG: Yeah.


83
0:3:49,62 --> 0:3:52,53
MICHEL GONDRY: But there is this
relation that's really


84
0:3:52,53 --> 0:3:57,71
complex and interesting because
all those guys that


85
0:3:57,71 --> 0:4:4,47
worked on this album are direct
influenced by what your


86
0:4:4,47 --> 0:4:5,28
father did.


87
0:4:5,28 --> 0:4:6,11
CHARLOTTE GAINSBOURG:
Yeah, yeah.


88
0:4:6,11 --> 0:4:9,75
MICHEL GONDRY: And basically
their music is a tribute.


89
0:4:9,75 --> 0:4:12,5
Without you, way before they
met you, the music is a


90
0:4:12,5 --> 0:4:13,725
tribute to what your
father was doing.


91
0:4:13,725 --> 0:4:15,67
CHARLOTTE GAINSBOURG: But each
time I could hear that


92
0:4:15,67 --> 0:4:20,6
something was close to one of my
father's songs in the music


93
0:4:20,6 --> 0:4:21,93
I was really proud.


94
0:4:21,93 --> 0:4:28,2
It was in the words that I
didn't want to be like a pale


95
0:4:28,2 --> 0:4:30,58
copy of something he had done.


96
0:4:30,58 --> 0:4:33,59
In the music, they came
out like tributes.


97
0:4:33,59 --> 0:4:34,33
MICHEL GONDRY: Yeah.


98
0:4:34,33 --> 0:4:37,55
CHARLOTTE GAINSBOURG: And we
were all aware of, not my


99
0:4:37,55 --> 0:4:41,71
father's presence, but it was
like, everybody knew what I


100
0:4:41,71 --> 0:4:44,49
had in my head, that he was--


101
0:4:44,49 --> 0:4:47,56
that I thought about
him all the time.


102
0:4:47,56 --> 0:4:52,71
And Air, and Nigel, and Jarvis,
and Neil Hannon, too,


103
0:4:52,71 --> 0:4:58,84
they were all very, very
discreet about him.


104
0:4:58,84 --> 0:5:3,33
And I was always starting
to talk about him.


105
0:5:3,33 --> 0:5:4,89
It was strange, yeah.


106
0:5:4,89 --> 0:5:7,146
MICHEL GONDRY: Yeah, that's
interesting, yeah.


107
0:5:7,146 --> 0:5:13,64
But I think it's a nice loop
that comes back to a sort of


108
0:5:13,64 --> 0:5:15,6
healthy place.


109
0:5:15,6 --> 0:5:20,74
The way inspiration and tribute
and then coming back


110
0:5:20,74 --> 0:5:25,15
to where it started, and
somewhat in a different


111
0:5:25,15 --> 0:5:26,774
generation.


112
0:5:26,774 --> 0:5:27,98
CHARLOTTE GAINSBOURG: Mmm.


113
0:5:27,98 --> 0:5:30,0
MICHEL GONDRY: So we're
talking about


114
0:5:30,0 --> 0:5:33,8
being in the studio.


115
0:5:33,8 --> 0:5:37,55
And I like the idea that the
studio is a place where things


116
0:5:37,55 --> 0:5:39,86
are created.


117
0:5:39,86 --> 0:5:41,68
CHARLOTTE GAINSBOURG:
Yeah, well for me it


118
0:5:41,68 --> 0:5:42,93
was also just being--


119
0:5:42,93 --> 0:5:45,63



120
0:5:45,63 --> 0:5:48,9
because I wasn't composing
any music.


121
0:5:48,9 --> 0:5:51,4
And I was trying to write
lyrics, but I wasn't


122
0:5:51,4 --> 0:5:52,6
very good at it.


123
0:5:52,6 --> 0:5:55,78
And I was very embarrassed
about myself,


124
0:5:55,78 --> 0:5:57,34
and what I was writing.


125
0:5:57,34 --> 0:6:0,48
So at the beginning, I was
really enjoying just being a


126
0:6:0,48 --> 0:6:3,6
witness of their work.


127
0:6:3,6 --> 0:6:6,53
And just being able to be
there whilst they were


128
0:6:6,53 --> 0:6:11,926
creating something, and
instrument after instrument.


129
0:6:11,926 --> 0:6:14,34
It was such a magical
time for me.


130
0:6:14,34 --> 0:6:18,26
And with Nigel behind
the commands.


131
0:6:18,26 --> 0:6:24,4
But I remember, before we
started going in the studio, I


132
0:6:24,4 --> 0:6:28,59
remember just talking to Nicolas
and Jean-Benoit, for


133
0:6:28,59 --> 0:6:33,28
such a long time because I was
so scared to start something


134
0:6:33,28 --> 0:6:37,415
that I wanted to talk about what
it was going to be like,


135
0:6:37,415 --> 0:6:41,54
and what kind of music,
and the words were so


136
0:6:41,54 --> 0:6:42,54
important for me.


137
0:6:42,54 --> 0:6:46,81
So what lyrics, and after a
while, they just pushed me and


138
0:6:46,81 --> 0:6:51,18
said, we can't just talk
about it for years.


139
0:6:51,18 --> 0:6:54,87
You have to go in the studio
and see what happens.


140
0:6:54,87 --> 0:6:59,96
And it's true because maybe
nothing could've happened.


141
0:6:59,96 --> 0:7:3,2
And it just did.


142
0:7:3,2 --> 0:7:6,78
And with no pressure.


143
0:7:6,78 --> 0:7:10,9
Until we weren't happy,
we could go on.


144
0:7:10,9 --> 0:7:14,15
And that was a great luxury
to have that.


145
0:7:14,15 --> 0:7:17,55
MICHEL GONDRY: So they were
really probably so pleased to


146
0:7:17,55 --> 0:7:19,63
be next to you.


147
0:7:19,63 --> 0:7:22,32
And I think sometimes, even
if you don't physically or


148
0:7:22,32 --> 0:7:24,612
actively participate, if you're
there next to the


149
0:7:24,612 --> 0:7:26,96
person, it makes all
the difference.


150
0:7:26,96 --> 0:7:27,98
CHARLOTTE GAINSBOURG:
I think it did make


151
0:7:27,98 --> 0:7:30,71
a difference because--


152
0:7:30,71 --> 0:7:32,9
MICHEL GONDRY: Because they feel
they are doing it with


153
0:7:32,9 --> 0:7:33,45
you, even though you
weren't singing.


154
0:7:33,45 --> 0:7:37,59
Although where they would feel
like just record like session


155
0:7:37,59 --> 0:7:39,65
musicians, and then you come
to do your vocals.


156
0:7:39,65 --> 0:7:40,2
CHARLOTTE GAINSBOURG: Exactly.


157
0:7:40,2 --> 0:7:43,98
I would have hated to just
receive a CD with all the


158
0:7:43,98 --> 0:7:47,16
tracks and then just go in
the studio and record it.


159
0:7:47,16 --> 0:7:48,33
I wanted to be there.


160
0:7:48,33 --> 0:7:51,515
I wanted to be a part
of everything.


161
0:7:51,515 --> 0:7:54,27
And I know that they
knew that.


162
0:7:54,27 --> 0:7:59,1
I needed that time, also, for
myself, to be able to go


163
0:7:59,1 --> 0:8:3,62
behind the microphone
and just try things.


164
0:8:3,62 --> 0:8:4,51
MICHEL GONDRY: That's nice.


165
0:8:4,51 --> 0:8:8,0
It reminds me, I did some video
with Bjork where she's


166
0:8:8,0 --> 0:8:9,16
hardly not in it.


167
0:8:9,16 --> 0:8:12,13
We flew over Iceland, and we
took a lot of pictures.


168
0:8:12,13 --> 0:8:14,92
But I was scared to death
in the small plane.


169
0:8:14,92 --> 0:8:18,105
We went to this airport, and
they have some crashed plane


170
0:8:18,105 --> 0:8:20,59
on the side, and we're have
to go in the same one.


171
0:8:20,59 --> 0:8:22,67
And she would go,
always, with me.


172
0:8:22,67 --> 0:8:27,35
And I think the fact that she
was there, and even if she's


173
0:8:27,35 --> 0:8:32,9
not in front of the camera, it's
like it goes through me,


174
0:8:32,9 --> 0:8:34,429
like waves or something.


175
0:8:34,429 --> 0:8:38,669
And I think I always try
to work this way.


176
0:8:38,669 --> 0:8:41,809
Even if the artist is not
in front of the camera.


177
0:8:41,809 --> 0:8:44,636
He has to be behind or it's a
collaborative [INAUDIBLE].


178
0:8:44,636 --> 0:8:47,39
CHARLOTTE GAINSBOURG: Yeah.


179
0:8:47,39 --> 0:8:52,35
And Nigel was very important,
too, because


180
0:8:52,35 --> 0:8:54,11
he was a great judge.


181
0:8:54,11 --> 0:8:57,965
And I felt very close
to him in his--


182
0:8:57,965 --> 0:9:0,6



183
0:9:0,6 --> 0:9:5,89
every judgement he had on the
lyrics, mainly, for me.


184
0:9:5,89 --> 0:9:10,28
He was a great support.


185
0:9:10,28 --> 0:9:17,22
Also, to be able to think about
subjects I wanted to


186
0:9:17,22 --> 0:9:17,94
talk about.


187
0:9:17,94 --> 0:9:24,15
And just to make it feel
personal, I had


188
0:9:24,15 --> 0:9:26,86
to do it that way.


189
0:9:26,86 --> 0:9:28,39
MICHEL GONDRY: How old is he?


190
0:9:28,39 --> 0:9:28,55
CHARLOTTE GAINSBOURG: Nigel?


191
0:9:28,55 --> 0:9:29,5
He's exactly my age.


192
0:9:29,5 --> 0:9:32,65
He's 35.


193
0:9:32,65 --> 0:9:33,81
MICHEL GONDRY: And so he worked


194
0:9:33,81 --> 0:9:36,56
with Beck and Radiohead?


195
0:9:36,56 --> 0:9:37,32
CHARLOTTE GAINSBOURG: He
worked with Beck, with


196
0:9:37,32 --> 0:9:41,41
Radiohead, with Paul
McCartney.


197
0:9:41,41 --> 0:9:44,43
I was very intimidated
at first.


198
0:9:44,43 --> 0:9:50,68
Especially once the music was,
not finished, but there were


199
0:9:50,68 --> 0:9:54,45
times when I had to try
and put my voice on.


200
0:9:54,45 --> 0:10:0,7
I was so embarrassed, thinking
he's worked with such talent.


201
0:10:0,7 --> 0:10:1,78
MICHEL GONDRY: He has
the same feeling,


202
0:10:1,78 --> 0:10:3,9
probably, towards you.


203
0:10:3,9 --> 0:10:4,94
CHARLOTTE GAINSBOURG: He
can see I'm a fake.


204
0:10:4,94 --> 0:10:8,412
[LAUGHTER]


205
0:10:8,412 --> 0:10:15,37



206
0:10:15,37 --> 0:10:18,89
MICHEL GONDRY: So are you going
to tour with the band?


207
0:10:18,89 --> 0:10:20,14
CHARLOTTE GAINSBOURG:
I don't think I can.


208
0:10:20,14 --> 0:10:25,19



209
0:10:25,19 --> 0:10:28,9
I don't think I'm capable
of doing something.


210
0:10:28,9 --> 0:10:28,8
But maybe later.


211
0:10:28,8 --> 0:10:34,915
Maybe when I won't feel I have
to, I'll want to do it.


212
0:10:34,915 --> 0:10:39,54
But for the moment, I'm just
too nervous about it.


213
0:10:39,54 --> 0:10:41,5
MICHEL GONDRY: Well, don't you
think this nervousness is


214
0:10:41,5 --> 0:10:44,385
going to give something
to the concert?


215
0:10:44,385 --> 0:10:44,83
CHARLOTTE GAINSBOURG: No.


216
0:10:44,83 --> 0:10:46,165
MICHEL GONDRY: Oh, I think so.


217
0:10:46,165 --> 0:10:47,95
CHARLOTTE GAINSBOURG: No.


218
0:10:47,95 --> 0:10:54,53
MICHEL GONDRY: But I think
the awkwardness is very--


219
0:10:54,53 --> 0:10:56,42
he gives you a different
level of


220
0:10:56,42 --> 0:10:58,507
connection with your audience.


221
0:10:58,507 --> 0:10:59,83
And I find that with Bjork.


222
0:10:59,83 --> 0:11:2,46
Bjork, OK she's a very
professional singer.


223
0:11:2,46 --> 0:11:4,64
And she's done a ton
of concerts.


224
0:11:4,64 --> 0:11:6,47
But she doesn't connect
with the audience


225
0:11:6,47 --> 0:11:8,7
in a classical sense.


226
0:11:8,7 --> 0:11:12,565
She's not going to talk to the
microphone and say, hey, New


227
0:11:12,565 --> 0:11:13,305
York I love you.


228
0:11:13,305 --> 0:11:14,0
All this bullshit.


229
0:11:14,0 --> 0:11:14,76
She's on camera.


230
0:11:14,76 --> 0:11:15,94
CHARLOTTE GAINSBOURG: No, of
course, but she's such a


231
0:11:15,94 --> 0:11:17,17
performer that something--


232
0:11:17,17 --> 0:11:18,82
MICHEL GONDRY: I know
but, I think--


233
0:11:18,82 --> 0:11:19,3
CHARLOTTE GAINSBOURG:
--is happening.


234
0:11:19,3 --> 0:11:22,76
MICHEL GONDRY: What I like the
most in her concert is this


235
0:11:22,76 --> 0:11:25,9
non-connection she makes
with the audience.


236
0:11:25,9 --> 0:11:27,37
CHARLOTTE GAINSBOURG: Yeah,
but no, the thing is, I'm


237
0:11:27,37 --> 0:11:29,57
worried that--


238
0:11:29,57 --> 0:11:32,61
and really, it's not fake
modesty or something.


239
0:11:32,61 --> 0:11:36,818
But I'm just worried it
will be very boring.


240
0:11:36,818 --> 0:11:41,66
Because I'm not a performer,
so [INTERPOSING VOICES].


241
0:11:41,66 --> 0:11:43,445
MICHEL GONDRY: Well, to
me what's boring is


242
0:11:43,445 --> 0:11:45,81
professionalism.


243
0:11:45,81 --> 0:11:50,41
There is some quality
in not being in


244
0:11:50,41 --> 0:11:51,21
control of the situation.


245
0:11:51,21 --> 0:11:53,41
CHARLOTTE GAINSBOURG: Yeah, but
also, the thing is, for


246
0:11:53,41 --> 0:11:58,2
this album, because we did it
all together with Air and


247
0:11:58,2 --> 0:12:5,9
Jarvis, the fact that I would be
on stage on my own without


248
0:12:5,9 --> 0:12:7,55
them doesn't make any sense.


249
0:12:7,55 --> 0:12:8,32
MICHEL GONDRY: Well, of
course, but why don't


250
0:12:8,32 --> 0:12:9,596
you tour with them?


251
0:12:9,596 --> 0:12:11,15
CHARLOTTE GAINSBOURG: Well,
they have their


252
0:12:11,15 --> 0:12:12,29
own album to release.


253
0:12:12,29 --> 0:12:13,77
MICHEL GONDRY: All right,
well that's different.


254
0:12:13,77 --> 0:12:16,17
But I think you should
tour with them, yes.


255
0:12:16,17 --> 0:12:19,14
I saw them in Los Angeles.


256
0:12:19,14 --> 0:12:20,89
And they were doing the songs.


257
0:12:20,89 --> 0:12:24,27
The singer that was doing their
big hit at the time--


258
0:12:24,27 --> 0:12:27,22
I forgot her name-- and
she was so shy.


259
0:12:27,22 --> 0:12:28,74
It was a great moment.


260
0:12:28,74 --> 0:12:31,61
Obviously, she was just coming
from one song, and she could


261
0:12:31,61 --> 0:12:32,685
hardly sing.


262
0:12:32,685 --> 0:12:35,3
And it was a great moment
because the audience just


263
0:12:35,3 --> 0:12:38,13
wanted go with her,
and help her.


264
0:12:38,13 --> 0:12:39,914
And it was really--


265
0:12:39,914 --> 0:12:41,65
CHARLOTTE GAINSBOURG:
An American singer?


266
0:12:41,65 --> 0:12:42,62
MICHEL GONDRY: Yeah,
it was in--


267
0:12:42,62 --> 0:12:45,656
I don't know if she's
American or English.


268
0:12:45,656 --> 0:12:49,3
It's that song that
goes [SINGING].


269
0:12:49,3 --> 0:12:51,876
It's one of their big hits.


270
0:12:51,876 --> 0:12:54,6
CHARLOTTE GAINSBOURG: Yeah,
and she sings on


271
0:12:54,6 --> 0:12:54,99
the album, or she?


272
0:12:54,99 --> 0:12:56,95
MICHEL GONDRY: Yeah, yeah, that
was the singer on the


273
0:12:56,95 --> 0:12:59,525
album, but she sing few songs,
or maybe only one.


274
0:12:59,525 --> 0:13:2,898
But she came for this song.


275
0:13:2,898 --> 0:13:6,404
I can't sing it, but
it goes [SINGING].


276
0:13:6,404 --> 0:13:7,832
Do you know it?


277
0:13:7,832 --> 0:13:14,2
CHARLOTTE GAINSBOURG: [LAUGH]


278
0:13:14,2 --> 0:13:14,75
MICHEL GONDRY: So anyway,
yeah, you


279
0:13:14,75 --> 0:13:15,83
should tour with them.


280
0:13:15,83 --> 0:13:18,93
You should not tour with the
professional [INAUDIBLE].


281
0:13:18,93 --> 0:13:20,18
CHARLOTTE GAINSBOURG: Yeah.


282
0:13:20,18 --> 0:15:20,18
