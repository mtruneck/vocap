0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:7,11



2
0:0:7,11 --> 0:0:9,1
ANTWAUN DIXON: Whoo!


3
0:0:9,1 --> 0:0:10,4
See my new teeth I got?


4
0:0:10,4 --> 0:0:15,79



5
0:0:15,79 --> 0:0:17,4
[CHUCKLE].


6
0:0:17,4 --> 0:0:20,32



7
0:0:20,32 --> 0:0:22,4
That's when all the
cameras come on.


8
0:0:22,4 --> 0:0:24,23
And then that's when the
videos go on YouTube.


9
0:0:24,23 --> 0:0:26,29
Like, that's all everybody
see, oh fight,


10
0:0:26,29 --> 0:0:27,39
oh this, this, this.


11
0:0:27,39 --> 0:0:30,88
That's when I'm faded, just
like, living, like doing me,


12
0:0:30,88 --> 0:0:32,86
but you know what I'm saying,
just, like, whatever.


13
0:0:32,86 --> 0:0:35,265
That's who I am, whatever
position I'm in.


14
0:0:35,265 --> 0:0:39,12
It's always all eyes on me, but
niggas ain't got to put it


15
0:0:39,12 --> 0:0:40,67
on the internet and shit.


16
0:0:40,67 --> 0:0:41,94
They just--


17
0:0:41,94 --> 0:0:42,66
MALE SPEAKER: You think
that that's--


18
0:0:42,66 --> 0:0:43,3
ANTWAUN DIXON: --stupid


19
0:0:43,3 --> 0:0:43,8
MALE SPEAKER: --a little
one-sided?


20
0:0:43,8 --> 0:0:45,34
That like, doesn't
show who you are?


21
0:0:45,34 --> 0:0:45,8
ANTWAUN DIXON: Why?


22
0:0:45,8 --> 0:0:46,83
What do you mean?


23
0:0:46,83 --> 0:0:48,46
MALE SPEAKER: Like, all that
footage, do you think that


24
0:0:48,46 --> 0:0:49,16
doesn't really--


25
0:0:49,16 --> 0:0:49,89
ANTWAUN DIXON: Well, no duh.


26
0:0:49,89 --> 0:0:52,13
What, drunk and just fighting
and all that shit?


27
0:0:52,13 --> 0:0:53,38
No, that ain't me.


28
0:0:53,38 --> 0:0:55,77



29
0:0:55,77 --> 0:0:58,1
MALE SPEAKER: I think a lot of
people might say that, like


30
0:0:58,1 --> 0:1:3,4
the Baker thing, all the videos
and the ads, would be


31
0:1:3,4 --> 0:1:5,61
promoting the destructive
behavior.


32
0:1:5,61 --> 0:1:7,2
ANTWAUN DIXON: Shit.


33
0:1:7,2 --> 0:1:8,37
ANDREW REYNOLDS: I just tell
the truth about how


34
0:1:8,37 --> 0:1:10,6
skateboarding is.


35
0:1:10,6 --> 0:1:12,69
I like "Goodfellas," but I'm not
going to go shoot somebody


36
0:1:12,69 --> 0:1:13,78
and chop them up.


37
0:1:13,78 --> 0:1:15,28
You know what I mean?


38
0:1:15,28 --> 0:1:16,8
Whatever.


39
0:1:16,8 --> 0:1:18,98
It's like, people were bent out
of shape about the tour


40
0:1:18,98 --> 0:1:21,17
video because people
were doing drugs.


41
0:1:21,17 --> 0:1:24,18
And that's the footage
Beagle gave me.


42
0:1:24,18 --> 0:1:27,9
What am I going to do,
candy-coat it and make it not


43
0:1:27,9 --> 0:1:28,19
what it really was?


44
0:1:28,19 --> 0:1:29,986
Just show what it really was.


45
0:1:29,986 --> 0:1:32,4
MALE SPEAKER: Do you ever worry
that Antwaun's career


46
0:1:32,4 --> 0:1:35,1
could just cut short because
of going to jail?


47
0:1:35,1 --> 0:1:36,15
Like, for real, jail?


48
0:1:36,15 --> 0:1:37,166
LIZARD KING: Yeah, yeah,
like prison.


49
0:1:37,166 --> 0:1:38,77
Like, stupid shit.


50
0:1:38,77 --> 0:1:40,96
Yeah, yeah, I trip on him
all the time, man.


51
0:1:40,96 --> 0:1:43,98
But, I mean, even if I said
anything to him, he wouldn't


52
0:1:43,98 --> 0:1:45,37
give a fuck.


53
0:1:45,37 --> 0:1:49,0
But it just sucks to think
that he has the sickest--


54
0:1:49,0 --> 0:1:52,76
dude, he's the fucking best
dude on a skateboard ever.


55
0:1:52,76 --> 0:1:56,49
And he fucking got caught up
in that fucking scene, you


56
0:1:56,49 --> 0:1:57,29
know what I mean?


57
0:1:57,29 --> 0:1:59,33
MALE SPEAKER: I'll
take aim for you.


58
0:1:59,33 --> 0:2:3,53
MALE SPEAKER: Blowing his
CO dude with smoke.


59
0:2:3,53 --> 0:4:6,655



60
0:4:6,655 --> 0:4:7,905
MALE SPEAKER: That's
your brother?


61
0:4:7,905 --> 0:4:55,492



62
0:4:55,492 --> 0:4:57,32
ANTWAUN DIXON: And Beagle was
the last person that was with


63
0:4:57,32 --> 0:4:59,24
me when I've seen my brother.


64
0:4:59,24 --> 0:5:1,493
That's real.


65
0:5:1,493 --> 0:5:31,2



66
0:5:31,2 --> 0:5:31,82
ANTWAUN DIXON: My nigga.


67
0:5:31,82 --> 0:5:33,69
Like for real.


68
0:5:33,69 --> 0:5:35,33
Like for real.


69
0:5:35,33 --> 0:5:38,81



70
0:5:38,81 --> 0:5:39,134
MALE SPEAKER: Who?


71
0:5:39,134 --> 0:5:39,68
Terry and your brother?


72
0:5:39,68 --> 0:5:40,93
ANTWAUN DIXON: TK, yeah.


73
0:5:40,93 --> 0:5:50,84



74
0:5:50,84 --> 0:5:52,59
ANTWAUN DIXON: Hey, you already
know what that's


75
0:5:52,59 --> 0:5:53,7
about, nigga.


76
0:5:53,7 --> 0:5:55,2
ANDREW REYNOLDS: That's
what people say.


77
0:5:55,2 --> 0:5:58,81
A lot of people say he looks
up to his brother a lot.


78
0:5:58,81 --> 0:6:1,8
So that's like, he doesn't
look up to


79
0:6:1,8 --> 0:6:3,13
someone who's doing good.


80
0:6:3,13 --> 0:6:5,481
He looks up to someone who's
probably in jail for the rest


81
0:6:5,481 --> 0:6:7,47
of their life.


82
0:6:7,47 --> 0:6:21,8



83
0:6:21,8 --> 0:6:23,5
ANTWAUN DIXON: Always.


84
0:6:23,5 --> 0:6:27,65



85
0:6:27,65 --> 0:6:28,9
MALE SPEAKER: Make it work.


86
0:6:28,9 --> 0:6:55,56



87
0:6:55,56 --> 0:6:56,76
ANTWAUN DIXON: Ain't
that real?


88
0:6:56,76 --> 0:6:57,66
That real.


89
0:6:57,66 --> 0:6:59,76
Hey, ain't that real?


90
0:6:59,76 --> 0:7:1,1
I'm going to take
your shirt off.


91
0:7:1,1 --> 0:9:1,1
