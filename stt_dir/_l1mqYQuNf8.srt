1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:47,25



2
0:0:47,25 --> 0:0:49,995
FEMALE SPEAKER: Have you
always been an artist?


3
0:0:49,995 --> 0:0:51,0
THOM DEVITA: What'd you say?


4
0:0:51,0 --> 0:0:52,972
FEMALE SPEAKER: Have you
always been an artist?


5
0:0:52,972 --> 0:0:55,53
THOM DEVITA: Yeah, for
about 40 years.


6
0:0:55,53 --> 0:0:57,955
JOHN WYATT: He's the
greatest tattooer.


7
0:0:57,955 --> 0:0:59,41
FEMALE SPEAKER: Greatest
tattooer?


8
0:0:59,41 --> 0:0:59,705
[INAUDIBLE].


9
0:0:59,705 --> 0:1:2,32
THOM DEVITA: I can
do that also.


10
0:1:2,32 --> 0:1:3,73
FEMALE SPEAKER: You can, yeah.


11
0:1:3,73 --> 0:1:9,37



12
0:1:9,37 --> 0:1:15,218
THOM DEVITA: Every shop I went
in, I'd tell them I'm deVita.


13
0:1:15,218 --> 0:1:17,186
And they never heard
of deVita.


14
0:1:17,186 --> 0:1:20,138
You walk out like you're
an idiot, you know?


15
0:1:20,138 --> 0:1:23,9
Who the hell is deVita?


16
0:1:23,9 --> 0:1:27,166
JOHN WYATT: And now they're
honored to have you.


17
0:1:27,166 --> 0:1:29,78
THOM DEVITA: Oh,
let me finish.


18
0:1:29,78 --> 0:1:48,66



19
0:1:48,66 --> 0:1:52,14
JOHN WYATT: When they meet
Thom, they will realize


20
0:1:52,14 --> 0:1:55,32
they've never met anybody
like him before.


21
0:1:55,32 --> 0:1:58,2
He's probably the most different
person, without


22
0:1:58,2 --> 0:2:2,4
trying to be different, of
anybody I've ever met.


23
0:2:2,4 --> 0:2:4,2
He's so many different things.


24
0:2:4,2 --> 0:2:8,58
He's a tattoo artist, but
he's also a fine artist.


25
0:2:8,58 --> 0:2:10,78
I think he's one of the
true originals.


26
0:2:10,78 --> 0:2:14,33
THOM DEVITA: But you've got
these lines in here anyway


27
0:2:14,33 --> 0:2:15,41
from the cardboard.


28
0:2:15,41 --> 0:2:17,107
MALE SPEAKER: The corrugation,
yeah.


29
0:2:17,107 --> 0:2:18,41
I really like it.


30
0:2:18,41 --> 0:2:21,777
There's a good, strong
iconic strike to it.


31
0:2:21,777 --> 0:2:23,96
Where in the city were
you located?


32
0:2:23,96 --> 0:2:24,575
THOM DEVITA: On the
Lower East Side.


33
0:2:24,575 --> 0:2:25,64
MALE SPEAKER: Very nice.


34
0:2:25,64 --> 0:2:28,394
THOM DEVITA: It wasn't nice
when I went there.


35
0:2:28,394 --> 0:2:30,34
MALE SPEAKER: I guess it's
nice today, right?


36
0:2:30,34 --> 0:2:31,66
It's all about [INAUDIBLE].


37
0:2:31,66 --> 0:2:32,535
THOM DEVITA: Thanks
for coming in.


38
0:2:32,535 --> 0:2:34,842
Take a card.


39
0:2:34,842 --> 0:2:38,586
MALE SPEAKER: Wow, deVita.


40
0:2:38,586 --> 0:2:41,38
NICK BUBASH: What I try to get
across about Thom deVita to


41
0:2:41,38 --> 0:2:43,26
anybody that's interested--


42
0:2:43,26 --> 0:2:45,982
he wasn't just a tattoo
artist, he was


43
0:2:45,982 --> 0:2:48,21
an artist who tattooed.


44
0:2:48,21 --> 0:2:50,98
It was all one big ball
of wax with him.


45
0:2:50,98 --> 0:2:53,39
Everything he did was art--


46
0:2:53,39 --> 0:2:56,29
the way he lived, the way he
talked, the way he thought,


47
0:2:56,29 --> 0:2:58,86
what he did, where he went.


48
0:2:58,86 --> 0:3:2,295
The tattoos were just as
important as the floor.


49
0:3:2,295 --> 0:3:5,4
And then it all came up
on onto his body.


50
0:3:5,4 --> 0:3:6,29
I mean, it was everywhere.


51
0:3:6,29 --> 0:3:14,5



52
0:3:14,5 --> 0:3:16,71
JOHN WYATT: Have you ever done
commercial art, Thom?


53
0:3:16,71 --> 0:3:17,96
THOM DEVITA: Yeah, tattooing.


54
0:3:17,96 --> 0:3:20,76



55
0:3:20,76 --> 0:3:22,342
Art that pays.


56
0:3:22,342 --> 0:3:24,31
JOHN WYATT: When's
the last time you


57
0:3:24,31 --> 0:3:25,294
set up a tattoo machine?


58
0:3:25,294 --> 0:3:28,9
THOM DEVITA: Not too long ago.


59
0:3:28,9 --> 0:3:31,715
Last year when I
was [INAUDIBLE]


60
0:3:31,715 --> 0:3:35,92
I'd write my name
on tattooers.


61
0:3:35,92 --> 0:3:38,375
JOHN WYATT: Aren't you going
to a convention this year?


62
0:3:38,375 --> 0:3:39,365
THOM DEVITA: Yeah, in October.


63
0:3:39,365 --> 0:3:40,615
JOHN WYATT: October?


64
0:3:40,615 --> 0:3:54,71



65
0:3:54,71 --> 0:3:57,63
BUBBA REEVES: I knew that Thom,
he wasn't wanting to do


66
0:3:57,63 --> 0:3:59,57
a whole lot more conventions.


67
0:3:59,57 --> 0:4:3,55
But I knew that his book had
came out, and his wife, Jenny,


68
0:4:3,55 --> 0:4:4,83
had lost her job.


69
0:4:4,83 --> 0:4:8,7
And so Thom kind of had to
be the money maker again.


70
0:4:8,7 --> 0:4:12,35
And Ed loves to have him out
here, and so I've kind of been


71
0:4:12,35 --> 0:4:14,24
helping Thom out with
his travels and


72
0:4:14,24 --> 0:4:17,6
his sales and stuff.


73
0:4:17,6 --> 0:4:20,5
He sells his artwork.


74
0:4:20,5 --> 0:4:23,29
He still works all
day, everyday,


75
0:4:23,29 --> 0:4:24,9
just like he tattooed.


76
0:4:24,9 --> 0:4:26,32
But now he does it on paper.


77
0:4:26,32 --> 0:4:30,96
So he has plenty of artwork to
sell of tattoo stencils and


78
0:4:30,96 --> 0:4:33,33
rubbings and stuff like that.


79
0:4:33,33 --> 0:4:36,85
When I first seen Thom's stuff,
I was wanting to get my


80
0:4:36,85 --> 0:4:39,46
back tattooed from him or
something real big.


81
0:4:39,46 --> 0:4:42,9
But by that time, he was
already done tattooing.


82
0:4:42,9 --> 0:4:44,57
I think it's been about
10 years since he's


83
0:4:44,57 --> 0:4:46,88
tattooed for a living.


84
0:4:46,88 --> 0:4:49,69
Well, the main thing, when you
get a tattoo by Thom, is he's


85
0:4:49,69 --> 0:4:51,36
going to have to like you.


86
0:4:51,36 --> 0:4:55,61
You're going to have to pass
this thing that you want to


87
0:4:55,61 --> 0:4:57,62
get a tattoo from him,
and you understand


88
0:4:57,62 --> 0:4:59,38
that his hand shakes.


89
0:4:59,38 --> 0:5:4,3
I tell them my hands shake
and I'm drunk,


90
0:5:4,3 --> 0:5:6,795
and they don't care.


91
0:5:6,795 --> 0:5:9,27
BUBBA REEVES: His signature
is what he does.


92
0:5:9,27 --> 0:5:12,81
That's his last name with
his birth date.


93
0:5:12,81 --> 0:5:15,79
Since he's been tattooing,
he tattoos for


94
0:5:15,79 --> 0:5:18,48
$30 always, I heard.


95
0:5:18,48 --> 0:5:21,66
And so he charges the tattooers
that get tattooed by


96
0:5:21,66 --> 0:5:24,63
him $30 for his name.


97
0:5:24,63 --> 0:5:27,43
The first time I heard about
Thom was through the "Tattoo


98
0:5:27,43 --> 0:5:29,82
Times," and I was like
man, this guy's


99
0:5:29,82 --> 0:5:32,46
doing something special.


100
0:5:32,46 --> 0:5:34,3
ED HARDY: When we did this
"Tattoo Times" series in


101
0:5:34,3 --> 0:5:36,28
magazines, my primary goal with
that was to enlighten


102
0:5:36,28 --> 0:5:38,84
people, make people realize
that there was a lot more


103
0:5:38,84 --> 0:5:41,59
depth and history and complexity
to tattooing than


104
0:5:41,59 --> 0:5:42,32
anybody realized.


105
0:5:42,32 --> 0:5:44,83
And then finally, by the fifth
issue, I was like, oh my god,


106
0:5:44,83 --> 0:5:46,466
I've got to do something
on Malone, who was


107
0:5:46,466 --> 0:5:47,12
a very close friend.


108
0:5:47,12 --> 0:5:48,59
And he introduced
me to deVita.


109
0:5:48,59 --> 0:5:51,39
And do a piece on deVita,
because deVita's was such an


110
0:5:51,39 --> 0:5:52,83
important guy.


111
0:5:52,83 --> 0:5:55,28
Hopefully, it woke people
up to who he was.


112
0:5:55,28 --> 0:5:58,46
Culturally, it was a
subterranean practice, and


113
0:5:58,46 --> 0:5:59,71
deVita was sub-subterranean.


114
0:5:59,71 --> 0:6:2,708



115
0:6:2,708 --> 0:6:4,67
ROBERT RYAN: When people say
that someone has a cult


116
0:6:4,67 --> 0:6:8,13
following, I think that people
that know and get it really


117
0:6:8,13 --> 0:6:10,9
appreciate his work and really
have a lot of love for it.


118
0:6:10,9 --> 0:6:12,7
And I think it flies over
the heads of a lot


119
0:6:12,7 --> 0:6:14,59
of people as well.


120
0:6:14,59 --> 0:6:18,5
I was a deVita devotee
from the beginning.


121
0:6:18,5 --> 0:6:20,46
It just unlocked this whole
world that I was already


122
0:6:20,46 --> 0:6:23,37
totally into of the Lower
East Side of New York.


123
0:6:23,37 --> 0:6:27,14
There's this creative energy
there that I think Thom's work


124
0:6:27,14 --> 0:6:28,72
definitely emanates.


125
0:6:28,72 --> 0:6:33,16
There's not a lot of care-taking
in trying to nail


126
0:6:33,16 --> 0:6:35,32
each line so everything's
perfect.


127
0:6:35,32 --> 0:6:38,82
But I think he captures the
essence and the energy of a


128
0:6:38,82 --> 0:6:40,63
tattoo design.


129
0:6:40,63 --> 0:6:42,6
NICK BUBASH: It had an
earthiness to it.


130
0:6:42,6 --> 0:6:43,56
It had soul to it.


131
0:6:43,56 --> 0:6:46,29
Thom characterizes
it as folk art.


132
0:6:46,29 --> 0:6:49,146
He says all tattooing
is folk art.


133
0:6:49,146 --> 0:6:51,485
That's right from his mouth.


134
0:6:51,485 --> 0:6:53,79
MALE SPEAKER: Now they've turned
into things that the


135
0:6:53,79 --> 0:6:56,92
Metropolitan Museum could
display proudly, some of the


136
0:6:56,92 --> 0:6:58,25
tattoos that are being done.


137
0:6:58,25 --> 0:6:59,31
THOM DEVITA: But it's
still folk art.


138
0:6:59,31 --> 0:7:0,37
MALE SPEAKER: Those
humble beginnings.


139
0:7:0,37 --> 0:7:1,77
THOM DEVITA: But it's
still folk art.


140
0:7:1,77 --> 0:7:5,69
MALE SPEAKER: But once it gets
put on your body, it


141
0:7:5,69 --> 0:7:6,11
becomes folk art.


142
0:7:6,11 --> 0:7:8,3
THOM DEVITA: Instantly.


143
0:7:8,3 --> 0:7:9,84
Some of them are
real folk art.


144
0:7:9,84 --> 0:7:12,55



145
0:7:12,55 --> 0:7:14,805
I work with traditional
tattoo designs.


146
0:7:14,805 --> 0:7:18,92



147
0:7:18,92 --> 0:7:21,24
I like repeating myself.


148
0:7:21,24 --> 0:7:23,67
That's why I like tattooing.


149
0:7:23,67 --> 0:7:28,79
It's just drawing the same
panthers on a hundred guys.


150
0:7:28,79 --> 0:7:32,41
I have a hard time copying what
someone else had done.


151
0:7:32,41 --> 0:7:36,72
But I'd start off with the
Coleman design, and I would


152
0:7:36,72 --> 0:7:39,89
fill it in a little differenty,
because you just


153
0:7:39,89 --> 0:7:41,26
can't copy.


154
0:7:41,26 --> 0:7:43,75
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, I
got one on my leg.


155
0:7:43,75 --> 0:7:45,81
I only have one piece of his.


156
0:7:45,81 --> 0:7:47,31
It's on the back of this leg.


157
0:7:47,31 --> 0:7:50,286
He did it all with a shader.


158
0:7:50,286 --> 0:7:53,21
It was from a design on his
wall that was some kind of


159
0:7:53,21 --> 0:7:55,292
Catholic image.


160
0:7:55,292 --> 0:7:58,1
CLAYTON PATTERSON: His flash
would be on pieces of wood.


161
0:7:58,1 --> 0:7:58,795
Have you seen his flash?


162
0:7:58,795 --> 0:7:59,445
JOHN WYATT: Yeah.


163
0:7:59,445 --> 0:8:0,941
THOM DEVITA: Here's
a piece that was


164
0:8:0,941 --> 0:8:2,191
done on Fourth Street.


165
0:8:2,191 --> 0:8:5,851



166
0:8:5,851 --> 0:8:21,563
And that's my flash
from 30 years ago.


167
0:8:21,563 --> 0:8:23,58
ANGELO SCOTTO: At the time, you
didn't think people would


168
0:8:23,58 --> 0:8:25,13
get those tattoos, you
know what I mean?


169
0:8:25,13 --> 0:8:26,34
But it was art.


170
0:8:26,34 --> 0:8:27,655
I said, wow.


171
0:8:27,655 --> 0:8:30,4
I said, it's totally different
from what we were used to.


172
0:8:30,4 --> 0:8:33,809
That was, you went from
Spaulding and Rogers' flash to


173
0:8:33,809 --> 0:8:38,12
Thom deVita's designs, which
was a total transformation.


174
0:8:38,12 --> 0:8:39,34
Like overnight, you
could blink your


175
0:8:39,34 --> 0:8:41,509
eyes, you'd say, wow.


176
0:8:41,509 --> 0:8:44,869
MALE SPEAKER: That's probably
the most different piece of


177
0:8:44,869 --> 0:8:48,605
flash I've ever seen.


178
0:8:48,605 --> 0:8:50,56
CLAYTON PATTERSON: Part of what
this whole dialogue is


179
0:8:50,56 --> 0:8:53,6
about is transformation of
tattooing from kind of a


180
0:8:53,6 --> 0:8:57,86
classic, conservative,
traditional style to


181
0:8:57,86 --> 0:9:1,41
eventually it breaks out into
this whole new matrix.


182
0:9:1,41 --> 0:9:4,9
NICK BUBASH: I never thought
of them as high art.


183
0:9:4,9 --> 0:9:6,74
When I went to deVita's place,
and I saw what he was doing,


184
0:9:6,74 --> 0:9:10,13
that I started thinking
of as art.


185
0:9:10,13 --> 0:9:12,81
He's still kind of esoteric.


186
0:9:12,81 --> 0:9:14,36
You have to know what you're
talking about.


187
0:9:14,36 --> 0:9:15,57
You have go into the
history of it.


188
0:9:15,57 --> 0:9:19,73
You have to find out the early
beginnings of modern tattooing


189
0:9:19,73 --> 0:9:22,68
to understand we're all standing
on the shoulders of


190
0:9:22,68 --> 0:9:23,375
other people.


191
0:9:23,375 --> 0:9:27,79
And a lot of us are standing
on the shoulders of Thom.


192
0:9:27,79 --> 0:9:30,6
ROBERT RYAN: The thing that
really struck me about


193
0:9:30,6 --> 0:9:34,635
deVita's place in tattooing
was he wasn't a biker, he


194
0:9:34,635 --> 0:9:39,2
wasn't military, he wasn't
carny-- he was just a guy


195
0:9:39,2 --> 0:9:40,82
making his art.


196
0:9:40,82 --> 0:9:45,4
And it was rooted in traditional
tattooing, but it


197
0:9:45,4 --> 0:9:47,72
was his take on it.


198
0:9:47,72 --> 0:9:50,91
And the people that he
influenced in tattooing after


199
0:9:50,91 --> 0:9:53,595
that are definitely a lot of the
people that I also looked


200
0:9:53,595 --> 0:9:55,7
up to as well as Thom--


201
0:9:55,7 --> 0:10:1,41
guys like Ed, and Mike Malone,
Nick Bubash, Tux Farrar, Dan


202
0:10:1,41 --> 0:10:3,4
Higgs, Cliff Raven, too.


203
0:10:3,4 --> 0:10:8,16
No, none of those guys come from
that lineage of biker,


204
0:10:8,16 --> 0:10:11,21
carny, hot rod.


205
0:10:11,21 --> 0:10:16,96
It's just like this almost
poetic approach to tattooing


206
0:10:16,96 --> 0:10:18,55
that you didn't really
have before Thom.


207
0:10:18,55 --> 0:10:21,5



208
0:10:21,5 --> 0:10:24,57
And for Thom, it even went
further, because he was more


209
0:10:24,57 --> 0:10:26,14
into the experience.


210
0:10:26,14 --> 0:10:30,83
And I think that goes back a lot
further than what we know


211
0:10:30,83 --> 0:10:33,574
as our American history
in tattooing.


212
0:10:33,574 --> 0:10:38,22
I think that goes back to the
beginnings of it, where it was


213
0:10:38,22 --> 0:10:41,147
something that happened in
tribes and villages and small


214
0:10:41,147 --> 0:10:44,105
places all over the world.


215
0:10:44,105 --> 0:10:47,6
SCOTT HARRISON: The mark
itself has this sort of


216
0:10:47,6 --> 0:10:50,42
significant form, to use
the [INAUDIBLE] term.


217
0:10:50,42 --> 0:10:54,715
But it's just like each mark
is sort of an expression.


218
0:10:54,715 --> 0:10:58,79
And Thom, he does what he's
inspired to do at the moment.


219
0:10:58,79 --> 0:11:1,58
I'd been wanting to get my chest
tattooed for a while,


220
0:11:1,58 --> 0:11:3,81
and so I picked out this
panther head with a


221
0:11:3,81 --> 0:11:4,46
snake in its mouth.


222
0:11:4,46 --> 0:11:5,76
Perfect design for a chest.


223
0:11:5,76 --> 0:11:7,23
It would fit perfectly.


224
0:11:7,23 --> 0:11:10,81
He initially just put it so it
was, like, half covering


225
0:11:10,81 --> 0:11:11,65
another tattoo.


226
0:11:11,65 --> 0:11:13,79
It was like, there's plenty of
space, but he chose to put


227
0:11:13,79 --> 0:11:15,24
it-- he's like, see, it's
not going to work.


228
0:11:15,24 --> 0:11:16,46
And I'm like, oh, you
could just move it.


229
0:11:16,46 --> 0:11:17,83
So he washes it off.


230
0:11:17,83 --> 0:11:20,4
And while I'm standing there
waiting for him, he sneaks up


231
0:11:20,4 --> 0:11:22,75
behind me and puts a stencil
on the back of my arm.


232
0:11:22,75 --> 0:11:25,36
He's like, that's where
it should be.


233
0:11:25,36 --> 0:11:28,37
I told you when I got my first
deVita tattoo in New York, I


234
0:11:28,37 --> 0:11:29,38
came and showed it
to Bernie Luther.


235
0:11:29,38 --> 0:11:33,77
And he was like, it's so ugly.


236
0:11:33,77 --> 0:11:36,38
And I go swimming with tattooers
and they're like,


237
0:11:36,38 --> 0:11:41,14
oh, I've never seen anyone like
a bad tattoo that much.


238
0:11:41,14 --> 0:11:42,56
It's like, dude, you
don't see it.


239
0:11:42,56 --> 0:11:46,72
You're not stepping back out of
the commercial art form and


240
0:11:46,72 --> 0:11:49,52
seeing that there's
this larger thing.


241
0:11:49,52 --> 0:11:51,89
It's like the difference between
listening to something


242
0:11:51,89 --> 0:11:57,91
like Kenny G or listening
to the Stooges.


243
0:11:57,91 --> 0:12:0,5
You're missing the point.


244
0:12:0,5 --> 0:12:1,9
My favorite wind bars.


245
0:12:1,9 --> 0:12:2,7
You did the wind bars.


246
0:12:2,7 --> 0:12:5,46
They're so good.


247
0:12:5,46 --> 0:12:6,45
SCOTT HARRISON: You did those!


248
0:12:6,45 --> 0:12:7,3
THOM DEVITA: Yeah?


249
0:12:7,3 --> 0:12:9,2
SCOTT HARRISON: Yep.


250
0:12:9,2 --> 0:12:12,837
Who else would have
does those?


251
0:12:12,837 --> 0:12:17,4
THOM DEVITA: Whenever we
tattoo, we collaborate.


252
0:12:17,4 --> 0:12:22,922
If you get something that Nick
done on somebody, or with any


253
0:12:22,922 --> 0:12:27,5
tattooer, and somebody else
worked on it, on the guy's


254
0:12:27,5 --> 0:12:28,89
body, it means you're
collaborating.


255
0:12:28,89 --> 0:12:33,78



256
0:12:33,78 --> 0:12:35,23
SCOTT HARRISON: That's one
thing Thom loves is when


257
0:12:35,23 --> 0:12:38,295
there's an old advertising
pane on the wall.


258
0:12:38,295 --> 0:12:40,765
And then part of it's painted
out, but you can see it


259
0:12:40,765 --> 0:12:41,904
through, and there's another
one on there.


260
0:12:41,904 --> 0:12:44,825
And then there's another thing
over there, and there's a


261
0:12:44,825 --> 0:12:46,789
little graffiti-- he loves
that layering effect.


262
0:12:46,789 --> 0:12:51,68



263
0:12:51,68 --> 0:12:54,24
CLAYTON PATTERSON: Tattoos
tend to be classic--


264
0:12:54,24 --> 0:13:0,24
a dragon, a tribal, an abstract,
but never the whole


265
0:13:0,24 --> 0:13:1,78
combination.


266
0:13:1,78 --> 0:13:4,44
Now the other thing Thom does,
which almost nobody else does,


267
0:13:4,44 --> 0:13:6,48
is people will cover
up a tattoo.


268
0:13:6,48 --> 0:13:8,26
And to me, there's a
richness and beauty


269
0:13:8,26 --> 0:13:9,355
with really old colors.


270
0:13:9,355 --> 0:13:13,55
So then he would take his new
stencil, snap it down, and


271
0:13:13,55 --> 0:13:16,74
then so now he's got one of
his tribal tattoos totally


272
0:13:16,74 --> 0:13:17,74
covering this area.


273
0:13:17,74 --> 0:13:21,4
He might maybe blacken this
whole part in through to here,


274
0:13:21,4 --> 0:13:24,66
leave this part of the eye and
head, and then maybe finish


275
0:13:24,66 --> 0:13:28,76
off the tribal coming down
here, leaving this part.


276
0:13:28,76 --> 0:13:31,45
And so it's like a collage.


277
0:13:31,45 --> 0:13:33,83
And people now, when they're
going to redo a tattoo, it's a


278
0:13:33,83 --> 0:13:34,83
standard way of thinking.


279
0:13:34,83 --> 0:13:37,21
I don't care how creative the
artist is, he looks at the


280
0:13:37,21 --> 0:13:38,33
tattoo, and he thinks, OK,
I'm going to cover


281
0:13:38,33 --> 0:13:39,396
this whole thing up.


282
0:13:39,396 --> 0:13:42,76
You get very few people who try
to integrate with the old.


283
0:13:42,76 --> 0:13:45,86
You've got the tribal mixed with
the other elements, and


284
0:13:45,86 --> 0:13:47,4
now you've got a whole
different look.


285
0:13:47,4 --> 0:13:50,2
And some of Carlos' tattoos,
I hope there's really great


286
0:13:50,2 --> 0:13:52,69
pictures of those, because
that's a classy example of


287
0:13:52,69 --> 0:13:56,62
that collage weave that I've
never seen anybody else do up


288
0:13:56,62 --> 0:13:57,87
until this point.


289
0:13:57,87 --> 0:14:0,46



290
0:14:0,46 --> 0:14:3,7
That's the one thing that's
totally unique and amazing


291
0:14:3,7 --> 0:14:5,79
about Thom, which is also
the drawback factor.


292
0:14:5,79 --> 0:14:9,17
Because original is not really
respected that much.


293
0:14:9,17 --> 0:14:11,5
Because original, especially in
a conservative world, kind


294
0:14:11,5 --> 0:14:13,375
of shakes the whole thing up.


295
0:14:13,375 --> 0:14:15,1
NICK BUBASH: There's a book
called "The Tipping Point"--


296
0:14:15,1 --> 0:14:15,69
have you ever read that?


297
0:14:15,69 --> 0:14:19,82
That shows you how one person
or a group of people can


298
0:14:19,82 --> 0:14:22,684
influence the entire world
with what they're doing.


299
0:14:22,684 --> 0:14:25,72
And I think that's pretty
much what Thom did.


300
0:14:25,72 --> 0:14:28,77
And I don't know that Thom knew
he was doing it, either.


301
0:14:28,77 --> 0:14:31,7
It's just what he was doing,
you know what I mean?


302
0:14:31,7 --> 0:14:33,6
He didn't set out saying, well,
I'm going to change the


303
0:14:33,6 --> 0:14:35,7
world with this.


304
0:14:35,7 --> 0:14:38,58
He's not that kind of
a person anyway.


305
0:14:38,58 --> 0:14:41,35
He's a very humble man,
and he was just


306
0:14:41,35 --> 0:14:42,885
doing what he was doing.


307
0:14:42,885 --> 0:14:46,295
He was making art, which he does
absolutely, automatically


308
0:14:46,295 --> 0:14:49,472
and completely naturally.


309
0:14:49,472 --> 0:14:50,905
He's on automatic.


310
0:14:50,905 --> 0:14:52,48
He never stops.


311
0:14:52,48 --> 0:14:55,44
What is he, 80-years-old with
Parkinson's disease now?


312
0:14:55,44 --> 0:14:58,185
He's shaking, and he's still
making art every day.


313
0:14:58,185 --> 0:14:59,7
He'll never quit.


314
0:14:59,7 --> 0:15:1,535
One time I asked him, are you
doing anything different?


315
0:15:1,535 --> 0:15:4,139
And he says, nah, I'm just
doing the same old stuff.


316
0:15:4,139 --> 0:15:8,51



317
0:15:8,51 --> 0:15:13,43
He still gets excited about it,
too, in kind of a low-tone


318
0:15:13,43 --> 0:15:13,919
excitement.


319
0:15:13,919 --> 0:15:14,897
What are you doing?


320
0:15:14,897 --> 0:15:16,853
I'm working on a bunch
of panda bears.


321
0:15:16,853 --> 0:15:18,809
THOM DEVITA: What do
you want to see?


322
0:15:18,809 --> 0:15:19,595
The panda scrolls?


323
0:15:19,595 --> 0:15:20,66
JOHN WYATT: Did you see
the panda scroll?


324
0:15:20,66 --> 0:15:22,652
MALE SPEAKER: No, I
don't think so.


325
0:15:22,652 --> 0:15:24,146
JOHN WYATT: That's important.


326
0:15:24,146 --> 0:15:42,11



327
0:15:42,11 --> 0:15:43,855
JOHN WYATT: Did you paint this
is response to something?


328
0:15:43,855 --> 0:15:47,752
THOM DEVITA: Yes, in response
of Ed's 2,000 dragons.


329
0:15:47,752 --> 0:15:53,704
I was going to do
2,000 pandas.


330
0:15:53,704 --> 0:15:55,688
JOHN WYATT: Did you ever
show this to him?


331
0:15:55,688 --> 0:15:57,672
THOM DEVITA: Yeah, he's
seen it, sure.


332
0:15:57,672 --> 0:16:0,648



333
0:16:0,648 --> 0:16:3,624
You should take [INAUDIBLE]
down like this.


334
0:16:3,624 --> 0:18:3,624
