1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:20,78



2
0:0:20,78 --> 0:0:23,6
FREDDY CORBIN: I tell them the
story, you know, well, I did


3
0:0:23,6 --> 0:0:25,75
my brother's funeral here, and
I got married, and I'm having


4
0:0:25,75 --> 0:0:29,67
a baby, so I'm kind of coming
back for good juju for his


5
0:0:29,67 --> 0:0:31,16
birth and stuff like that.


6
0:0:31,16 --> 0:0:33,24
And they just got it.


7
0:0:33,24 --> 0:0:34,81
They're way into thinking
like that.


8
0:0:34,81 --> 0:0:35,16
You know what I mean?


9
0:0:35,16 --> 0:0:37,32
So they just totally got it.


10
0:0:37,32 --> 0:0:40,35
We were trying to figure
out a place to tattoo.


11
0:0:40,35 --> 0:0:42,19
They told them what I was doing,
and asked them if it


12
0:0:42,19 --> 0:0:44,23
was OK if I tattooed
at the temple.


13
0:0:44,23 --> 0:0:47,97
They really dug the intention
of what we were doing.


14
0:0:47,97 --> 0:0:50,31
They were just dumbfounded, why
would you come here and


15
0:0:50,31 --> 0:0:51,78
tattoo us for free?


16
0:0:51,78 --> 0:0:54,34
Now, the temple would literally
only fit a few


17
0:0:54,34 --> 0:0:55,17
people in there.


18
0:0:55,17 --> 0:1:0,22
But we would do a puja every
morning, build an altar donate


19
0:1:0,22 --> 0:1:3,97
fruit to the sadhus,
the Brahmin


20
0:1:3,97 --> 0:1:7,22
priests that are monastic.


21
0:1:7,22 --> 0:1:9,13
My friend, Vinnie, that I was
telling you about, made a big


22
0:1:9,13 --> 0:1:10,46
flower mandala.


23
0:1:10,46 --> 0:1:12,47
We decorated the whole temple
with flowers and


24
0:1:12,47 --> 0:1:13,76
marigolds and stuff.


25
0:1:13,76 --> 0:1:15,8
It was really beautiful.


26
0:1:15,8 --> 0:1:16,47
It was really magical.


27
0:1:16,47 --> 0:1:19,84
So I just drew up this piece of
flash, any of these seven


28
0:1:19,84 --> 0:1:22,255
designs for free.


29
0:1:22,255 --> 0:1:26,9
I wrote it out in Hindi that
there was no charge.


30
0:1:26,9 --> 0:1:27,0
It was only symbols.


31
0:1:27,0 --> 0:1:28,17
It was religious symbols.


32
0:1:28,17 --> 0:1:32,958
So there was a Tibetan om, a
Hindu om, a Buddhist om, a


33
0:1:32,958 --> 0:1:35,5
cross, and a swastika with a--


34
0:1:35,5 --> 0:1:38,54
The swastikas over there usually
has four dots in them,


35
0:1:38,54 --> 0:1:40,25
one for each element.


36
0:1:40,25 --> 0:1:44,39
And it's funny because I did
tons of crosses, and I didn't


37
0:1:44,39 --> 0:1:49,5
do one swastika, which I thought
was kind of unusual.


38
0:1:49,5 --> 0:1:52,52
But they were like, since World
War II, we don't really


39
0:1:52,52 --> 0:1:54,71
push the swastika so much.


40
0:1:54,71 --> 0:1:56,31
It's all over our religious
artwork.


41
0:1:56,31 --> 0:1:59,16
It's all over our buildings and
our clothes, but, at the


42
0:1:59,16 --> 0:2:2,86
same time, they get that it
kind of hurts people's


43
0:2:2,86 --> 0:2:5,96
feelings, in a way, which I
thought was pretty cool.


44
0:2:5,96 --> 0:2:9,7
There was probably 50 guys
hanging out, and everybody's


45
0:2:9,7 --> 0:2:11,59
like, oh, me, me, me, me,
me first, me first.


46
0:2:11,59 --> 0:2:14,44
So we were basically trying
to figure out how are


47
0:2:14,44 --> 0:2:16,5
we going to do this?


48
0:2:16,5 --> 0:2:18,99
And are we going to
give them tickets?


49
0:2:18,99 --> 0:2:21,36
So my friend, Little Mary,
was really good.


50
0:2:21,36 --> 0:2:22,27
She had a great idea.


51
0:2:22,27 --> 0:2:26,32
She's like, just take a Sharpie
and just draw a number


52
0:2:26,32 --> 0:2:27,5
on them and sign it.


53
0:2:27,5 --> 0:2:30,89
So I would basically just
write number one,


54
0:2:30,89 --> 0:2:33,8
cross, and sign it.


55
0:2:33,8 --> 0:2:36,36
Number two, om, sign it.


56
0:2:36,36 --> 0:2:38,45
Dustin, my apprentice,
was just on point.


57
0:2:38,45 --> 0:2:41,95
He was right there next to me,
handing me a clean set up as


58
0:2:41,95 --> 0:2:43,0
soon as I--


59
0:2:43,0 --> 0:2:45,87
I'd take a smoke break every
four or five or whatever, but


60
0:2:45,87 --> 0:2:49,54
we worked pretty labor
intensively because we were


61
0:2:49,54 --> 0:2:51,39
tattooing under the
light of day.


62
0:2:51,39 --> 0:2:52,86
MALE SPEAKER: Were you the
only guy tattooing?


63
0:2:52,86 --> 0:2:54,68
FREDDY CORBIN: Yeah.


64
0:2:54,68 --> 0:2:58,1
Going into the night, I
had a head lamp on.


65
0:2:58,1 --> 0:3:1,25
So we only had a little bit
after dark to do it before


66
0:3:1,25 --> 0:3:3,12
they had to do the closing
ceremony and lock


67
0:3:3,12 --> 0:3:5,19
the doors and stuff.


68
0:3:5,19 --> 0:3:6,842
Then we'd go in back
and smoke hash with


69
0:3:6,842 --> 0:3:7,66
the priests and stuff.


70
0:3:7,66 --> 0:3:9,21
It was really awesome.


71
0:3:9,21 --> 0:3:12,62
A really sweet thing when I was
there the first time, I


72
0:3:12,62 --> 0:3:15,0
met this two really cool kids.


73
0:3:15,0 --> 0:3:17,64
It was Raj and Raju,
they're brothers.


74
0:3:17,64 --> 0:3:20,17
So Raj wanted to be
the first one.


75
0:3:20,17 --> 0:3:22,4
He's like, Freddy, can
I be the first one?


76
0:3:22,4 --> 0:3:24,34
Of course, of course.


77
0:3:24,34 --> 0:3:27,86
And just perfect for India
because no rules apply.


78
0:3:27,86 --> 0:3:30,42
I had the seven that you could
only get, but at the bottom,


79
0:3:30,42 --> 0:3:31,99
there was a little pyramid
with an eye,


80
0:3:31,99 --> 0:3:32,83
and he wanted that.


81
0:3:32,83 --> 0:3:36,44
So the first thing I did was
break the rules of only


82
0:3:36,44 --> 0:3:38,46
getting the seven and then
everybody was like,


83
0:3:38,46 --> 0:3:39,8
well, can I get it?


84
0:3:39,8 --> 0:3:40,89
And I was like, no,
no, no, only Raj.


85
0:3:40,89 --> 0:3:41,61
Only Raj.


86
0:3:41,61 --> 0:3:42,12
Only Raj.


87
0:3:42,12 --> 0:3:48,56
So I tattooed a cross on his
younger brother's neck and it


88
0:3:48,56 --> 0:3:49,52
looked pretty cool.


89
0:3:49,52 --> 0:3:53,86
I mean, it was on his neck, he's
like 16 years old now.


90
0:3:53,86 --> 0:3:57,9
And my cut off point
was 15 years old.


91
0:3:57,9 --> 0:3:59,8
So there was a lot of kids there
wanting to get tattooed,


92
0:3:59,8 --> 0:4:1,46
and I'd say, I can't
touch you, your


93
0:4:1,46 --> 0:4:2,92
parents would get mad.


94
0:4:2,92 --> 0:4:3,75
I have no parents.


95
0:4:3,75 --> 0:4:4,73
I am alone in the world.


96
0:4:4,73 --> 0:4:6,48
They give you this shtick.


97
0:4:6,48 --> 0:4:7,99
You know half the time
it's true, maybe.


98
0:4:7,99 --> 0:4:8,93
I don't know.


99
0:4:8,93 --> 0:4:11,55
There was a deaf
kid named Raul.


100
0:4:11,55 --> 0:4:12,68
He was deaf and dumb.


101
0:4:12,68 --> 0:4:17,399
And he obviously couldn't speak
or hear, and the older


102
0:4:17,399 --> 0:4:18,98
guys would let him
hang around.


103
0:4:18,98 --> 0:4:21,12
But you'd see other guys kind
of fucking with him a little


104
0:4:21,12 --> 0:4:22,93
bit, like teasing
him and stuff.


105
0:4:22,93 --> 0:4:25,19
He was young, so
he kept saying,


106
0:4:25,19 --> 0:4:25,93
I want to get tattooed.


107
0:4:25,93 --> 0:4:27,0
I want to get tattooed.


108
0:4:27,0 --> 0:4:29,45
I was like, no, no, no, no.


109
0:4:29,45 --> 0:4:32,31
And so after the first night,
I went to dinner with Dustin


110
0:4:32,31 --> 0:4:35,42
and Vinnie, and fortunately,
they


111
0:4:35,42 --> 0:4:36,43
brought it to my attention.


112
0:4:36,43 --> 0:4:40,9
They said this poor kid is
already missing out on so much


113
0:4:40,9 --> 0:4:43,57
in life, like not being
able to hear or speak.


114
0:4:43,57 --> 0:4:46,3
Other people are mocking him
and teasing him and stuff.


115
0:4:46,3 --> 0:4:49,5
This is just like one more
cool thing that's coming


116
0:4:49,5 --> 0:4:51,5
through town that he doesn't
get to participate in.


117
0:4:51,5 --> 0:4:53,69



118
0:4:53,69 --> 0:4:56,41
And I immediately wanted
to tattoo him, but I'm


119
0:4:56,41 --> 0:4:58,375
like he's so young.


120
0:4:58,375 --> 0:5:0,66
You know what mean?


121
0:5:0,66 --> 0:5:2,53
I know he was 11.


122
0:5:2,53 --> 0:5:7,575
I got Raul, the 11-year-old,
tattooed, and he got an S and


123
0:5:7,575 --> 0:5:10,8
an I with two periods
after them.


124
0:5:10,8 --> 0:5:13,4
Still to this day, nobody knows
what that stands for.


125
0:5:13,4 --> 0:5:15,61
So I said OK, we'll
go to your house.


126
0:5:15,61 --> 0:5:18,22
I'll tattoo you and Raj again.


127
0:5:18,22 --> 0:5:19,7
I'll tattoo Sunny.


128
0:5:19,7 --> 0:5:22,55
He's like, maybe my mom
wants to get tattooed.


129
0:5:22,55 --> 0:5:25,14
I started getting nervous as
we're going to the house


130
0:5:25,14 --> 0:5:27,72
because I'm going
to meet his mom.


131
0:5:27,72 --> 0:5:30,8
And I just tattooed
her kid's neck.


132
0:5:30,8 --> 0:5:31,86
You know what I mean?


133
0:5:31,86 --> 0:5:34,35
So I'm like, was it OK
with your mom that


134
0:5:34,35 --> 0:5:35,405
you guys got tattooed?


135
0:5:35,405 --> 0:5:35,68
Oh no.


136
0:5:35,68 --> 0:5:36,45
Yeah, yeah, yeah.


137
0:5:36,45 --> 0:5:36,955
It's totally cool.


138
0:5:36,955 --> 0:5:37,58
It's totally cool.


139
0:5:37,58 --> 0:5:39,2
I don't know if they're just
telling me that because they


140
0:5:39,2 --> 0:5:40,99
want to get me there--


141
0:5:40,99 --> 0:5:42,74
it's really cool or whatever.


142
0:5:42,74 --> 0:5:46,99
So we show up at the house and
the first thing I said after


143
0:5:46,99 --> 0:5:51,41
nice to meet you, was I really
hope it's OK that I tattooed


144
0:5:51,41 --> 0:5:52,33
your sons' necks.


145
0:5:52,33 --> 0:5:54,563
And she was like, oh,
we're Christians.


146
0:5:54,563 --> 0:5:57,915
I was like, oh, killer, OK.


147
0:5:57,915 --> 0:5:59,165
Like no problem.


148
0:5:59,165 --> 0:7:59,165
