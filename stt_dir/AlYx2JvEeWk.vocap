###304 DANNY LOZANO: For sure, it's the oldest store in Madrid, if
###309 not even Spain, I don't know.
###311 But it's super old.
###314 The thing is that it looks exactly the same now as it did
###318 25 years ago.
###320 But that's what gives it its beauty.

###360 IGNACIO: I think that we must begin with some boards that
###364 are really, really old school.
###365 These are the boards I was talking to you before.
###368 these are the Sancheskis.
###369 These were the first Spanish brand of
###371 skate, as you can see.
###374 I love this deck because this one, it was the first pro
###379 model deck of a Spanish guy.
###381 It was Ricardo Damborenea.
###384 He was a really, really good skater.
###386 And he still skates.
###388 He has skated with us every weekend.
###389 And now he's dedicating most of his time to slalom.
###394 This one is another Sancheski.
###398 You can see it's a bit weird.
###400 This one, it was [INAUDIBLE]
###402 with both feet like this, really near the feet.
###407 My name is Ignacio.
###408 I'm the son of the founder of Caribbean.
###411 His name is Jose Antonio.
###413 And in 1975, he opened Caribbean.
###416 And this was the first skate shop in Spain.
