###2 DALE TALDE: The halo-halo is our one dessert.
###5 It's our only dessert right now.
###7 "Halo-halo" really means "mix-mix." And it is a funkier
###12 Filipino version of a flavored snow cone.
###15 In the Philippines, typically it's topped up with, like,
###17 Rice Krispies that are like the bootleg version.
###20 They're not even in a box.
###21 They're in the bag.
###21 They're like on the bottom shelf, and they're in the bag.
###24 And it's like, hey, man, I looked at--
###25 I was like, if I'm going to put cereal on this.
###27 I'm going to put like dope cereal on it.
###29 I'm going to put Cap'n Crunch.
###30 It's my favorite.
###32 Seriously, dude, some people get it, some people
###34 just don't get it.
###35 Well, people who do love it, they take a bite of it, and
###38 there's this instant childhood memory.
###40 And you could tell that it clicks with some people.
###41 And when it doesn't, you're just like--
###44 you had like granola and yogurt, right?
###45 Your parents were hippies or some shit.
###46 And they didn't give you crappy cereal.
###48 Because I grew up on that, and I love that shit.

###66 DALE TALDE: Hi.
###66 My name is Dale Talde.
###68 This is Talde Restaurant, Park Slope, Brooklyn.
###71 The food here at Talde is Asian-American.
###74 It's holding on to some of these very traditional dishes
###78 and then giving it a Brooklyn, local, American feel to it.
###82 The neighborhood needed not just regular Tom Yum soup
###86 because they can get that in any Thai place around here.
###88 They wanted something more.
###90 
###93 I love Pad Thai.
###94 It's my thing.
###95 So I put brunch and Pad Thai together.
###97 And then I will just gild the lily a little bit and add some
###100 more oysters to it.
###102 If I was hung over and--like today--
###104 and to fix me up, to me, Pad Thai is the
###107 perfect hangover food.
###109 It's starch.
###110 It's greasy.
###112 It soaks up all the poison.
###114 And when I thought about it, I was like, you know what?
###116 For me, if I could have it for brunch, I would every day.
###119 First restaurant job was Outback
###121 Steakhouse, Bloomin' Onions.
###125 I was absolutely terrible.
###127 Pretty bad when you get stoned before you go to work.
###129 And then you're trying to work a station, and you're not
###131 really good at cooking as it is.
###133 And you're trying to do it stoned.
###135 Didn't work out too well.
###139 I love what I do, but I don't take myself too seriously.
###144 Top Chef gave me enormous opportunities.
###146 I mean, you get to travel.
###147 You get to meet tons of cool people.
###150 I mean, Dave recognized me walking into Enoteca, where at
###153 the time he was the GM and recognized me because he
###156 watched the show.
###157 And honestly, if I hadn't gone on the show, I probably won't
###159 be here right now.
###163 So last night, David Massoni, my partner, and John Bush,
###166 bartender and owner--
###168 at the end of the shift we went to Franny's.
###170 JOHN BUSH: I am hungry.
###171 DAVID MASSONI: I am hungry, too.
###172 DALE TALDE: Me, too.
###173 JOHN BUSH: They know we're coming?
###174 DAVID MASSONI: They know we're coming.
###176 Martin and the boys are ready.
###179 DALE TALDE: You don't need to go to Manhattan.
###181 You really don't.
###181 I mean, if you want to eat well, stay at the borough of
###184 Brooklyn because they're doing a killer job.
###187 
###190 MARTIN GOBBEE: Yeah.
###191 Should we seat you, guys?
###192 DAVID MASSONI: Shall we go ahead and have a seat, yeah?
###193 DALE TALDE: Hi, how's it going?
###194 Dale, Dale Talde.
###195 It's nice to meet you.
###196 He was a fucking big dude, man.
###198 If he came around my kitchen, I was like--
###199 I don't know.
###200 I'm not exactly the tallest dude in the world, man.
###202 You got to be like 6'4".
###203 
###206 DANNY AMEND: Franny's is definitely a southern Italian
###208 restaurant.
###209 We do make hand noodles, but most of our noodles are dry,
###212 which is what you would typically
###213 find in southern Italy.
###216 So this is definitely my favorite dish right now.
###219 And it might be my favorite Franny's dish ever--
###222 real basic citrus salad.
###224 Growing up in California--
###225 I'm from northern California.
###227 My mom had a satsuma tangerine tree that grow on our deck.
###231 And I used to eat this all the time.
###233 So it tastes a little bit like home.
###235 When I finish it, it has parsley.
###238 It has red onion, pistachios, hot peppers that we
###241 pickle in the house.
###243 So it's got a lot more soul to it.
###246 DALE TALDE: I mean their level of execution in what they're
###248 doing is so spot on.
###250 They were the benchmark for what we hope to be.
###254 They are destination restaurant on Flatbush Ave.--
###257 on Flatbush Ave., like four blocks away from where the
###261 Mets are going to play next year.
###263 People are coming out to see them because the food is
###264 fucking dope.
###265 And they're doing a good job.
###267 They're doing everything in-house.
###269 You can tell.
###270 DANNY AMEND: Spigarello, which is basically broccoli leaf.
###274 For me, I never had it before I came to Franny's.
###276 And that's another cool thing about the restaurant is we do
###280 a lot of things that most people have never had.
###284 DALE TALDE: Mm.
###286 It's so fucking good.
###287 It's like the best cool flavor I've ever had.
###289 
###292 What we're doing is just a craft.
###293 With them, you could tell that the level of
###295 craftsmanship is so high.
###298 Hopefully, we can get there.
###299 I mean, we're working hard every day.
###302 This is the fucking pasta I want to do.
###304 This kind of food makes you fucking jealous.
###306 [LAUGHTER]
###307 DAVID MASSONI: It makes you jealous?
###308 DALE TALDE: Yeah, it's like-- what the fuck?
###310 What have I done with my life?
###311 [CHUCKLES]
###313 I'm making fried rice.
###314 DAVID MASSONI: This food makes you wish you were Italian.
###316 DALE TALDE: It really does.
###318 DAVID MASSONI: Cheers, guys.
###320 The first night out since we opened the restaurant--
###322 DALE TALDE: --together.
###323 And it depends on the level of sobriety on that.
###325 It's what I want to eat.
###327 So I've had two whiskeys.
###329 I'm being somewhat civilized.
###331 And if I've gone on to, like three or four, then I'm really
###333 starting to get into the gross, uncivilized pizza with
###339 a ton a ranch and sriracha.
###342 And it's total blasphemy, but I'm down.
###345 
###350 I've got dope fat kid moves--
###352 making a box of mac and cheese, eating half of it, and
###355 then saving the hot sauce for the last half.
###358 So all of a sudden it tastes different and shit.
###359 So like, oh, no, I have a new mac and cheese.
###363 
###366 Somebody farted.
###367 DAVID MASSONI: It wasn't me.
###369 DALE TALDE: Somebody farted.
###370 DAVID AND JOHN (OFFSCREEN): Whoever smelt it, dealt it.
###371 [CHUCKLES]
###372 DALE TALDE: From Franny's we jumped in a cab and went to
###375 Pearl's Social Club in Bushwick, deep in Bushwick--
###380 those mad handlebar mustaches and really tight pants.
###385 Goddamn, in the borough, you could tell, like
###387 Monday is for pros.
###389 Friday and Saturday is for amateurs, and Monday is for
###391 the pros to go out because it was like all industry folks.
###394 And it was two, three at the bar deep.
###397 DAVID MASSONI: Hi, can I have three shots of Jamesons and
###398 three Tecates?
###400 DALE TALDE: People are drinking cheap beer.
###401 And I was like good, this is getting fucked up, but I'm
###404 having a good time.
###405 And it's awesome.
###406 That bar is awesome.
###408 DAVID MASSONI: To hanging out again.
###411 Salud.
###414 DALE TALDE: So we all did a shot of Jameson, drank a beer.
###416 And then Betsy, who owns the bar--
###419 awesome, awesome person-- she made us a cocktail and made it
###422 with the tobacco bitters.
###423 
###426 JOHN BUSH: What are these called?
###428 BETSY MAHER: Red dawn.
###429 DALE TALDE: America, fuck yeah!
###431 And that was it for me.
###433 That was the--
###435 you get to that point, and you just know that it's the end of
###437 your night?
###438 And that was the end of the night.
###439 And we were only like 2/3.
###440 [CHUCKLES]
###441 We weren't even halfway there.
###444 DAVID (OFFSCREEN): Can somebody get
###445 Dale a glass of water?
###446 DALE TALDE: It's like that big.
###447 DAVID MASSONI: A glass of water?
###448 
###452 DALE TALDE: I feel like a lot of pressure.
###453 Like, I have to actually cook for people now.
###455 And I'm going to get shit-faced and now, I have to
###457 fucking cook.
###458 JOHN BUSH: So Betsy, you want to come back and have some
###460 food with us tonight?
###461 We got some grub munchies.
###463 DALE TALDE: And we asked all the guys, Martin, the chef of
###465 Franny's, Betsy to come on in.
###467 Hey, Bill, so we're on our way back.
###470 DAVID MASSONI: [LAUGHTER]
###474 JOHN BUSH: You better be good, man.
###475 I'm hungry and I got to go bed.
###477 DALE TALDE: Not really.
###478 I'm not really prepared to cook shit.
###480 I've been cooking fucking all day.
###482 Now, I'm rundown.
###484 I told my guys there better be like 3 pounds of butter
###486 outside so I can make something fucking taste good.
###489 Brought it back here.
###490 And to be honest with you, I hope it tasted good because I
###495 remember very little what the fuck happened.
###497 
###501 Planning some black bean lobster--
###504 uh, I'm sorry, black bean clams.
###505 Where the fuck is everything?
###507 Chow fun noodles--
###509 I don't have the clams.
###511 Clams seem to not be here.
###514 
###519 No, I've no fucking idea what I'm planning to do right now.
###523 [LAUGHTER]
###526 I do not recommend using a wok when you're fucking hammered.
###530 They're about 180,000 btus, jet flames that
###534 pop out of that wok.
###535 It's taken ice from ice to boiling in 4 minutes.
###539 Do a little hot sauce.
###541 Cooking is about fire and food and the application of heat
###545 and/or salt and/or whatever.
###548 But I'm not one of those cooks that are subtle.
###551 And my food's always been "punch in your face" flavors.
###553 I will sacrifice the way something looks
###555 over taste any day.
###557 
###562 Chili black bean, brown butter clams.
###564 
###567 "Nooder?" Did anybody ask for some "nooders?" Chow fun
###575 "nooder?"
###576 I gotta serve you guys.
###579 You guys hooked us up.
###582 A little red-cooked pork shank with the chow fun noodle,
###586 charred red cabbage, and some bean sprouts.
###590 This restaurant is my last name.
###594 It's kind of a tribute to my family and my mom and my dad,
###597 who've helped me get to where I am.
###599 When we ate celebratory meals, it was always like--
###603 it was my mom and eight of her sisters and her entire family.
###606 So it was all of us getting together and eating.
###608 You have to love that part of restaurants, that atmosphere
###611 of hospitality and cooking for others and
###614 doing all for others.
###615 Making people happy, that's what it's about.
