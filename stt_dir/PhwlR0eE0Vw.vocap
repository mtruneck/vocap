###10 BRYAN IGUCHI: I guess I could say an average person could
###12 definitely become a good snowboarder.
###13 You know good enough to have a great time in the mountains.
###18 It's worth it, it's fun.
###20 SPEAKER: It could take up to a month to become a pro.
###24 BRYAN IGUCHI: Oh at least.
###26 BRYAN FOX: He's legendary everywhere, but down there he
###29 was you know, that type of thing where like the Guch is
###32 like from here.
###34 There's not a lot of people who are from Southern
###37 California and really made any sort of impact on snowboarding
###43 in general.
###44 I'd say Guch is like the most influential Southern
###48 California snowboarder.
###52 That'd be my personal opinion.
###55 PAT BRIDGES: Guch was a sponsored skateboarder, I
###58 think he skated for EPIC skateboards,
###61 something like that.
###62 So even before he got into snowboarding you knew he was a
###65 skater which was cool.
###66 BRYAN IGUCHI: I was 13 years old and I got sponsored by
###70 EPIC Skateboards out of northern California.
###72 But I actually got my first skate shot in "TransWorld,"
###77 Spike Jones shot it.
###79 And I was doing a feeble grind on like a flat bar in '89, I
###84 think it was.
###86 So the skateboarding thing was always--
###88 
###92 I was trying to go pro doing it but then I started
###95 snowboarding at the same time.
###96 And just kind of shifted from skateboarding to snowboarding.
###99 KEVIN JONES: When I started snowboarding, I really thought
###102 it was gay.
###103 I mean, in gay in the true sense of the word.
###107 I was like wow there is other people out there like me, they
###109 skateboard and they snowboard, wow this is cool, maybe it's
###112 not as gay as I thought it was.
###114 And then you saw like these trend setters, you saw all
###117 these guys that are--
###120 Guch especially, just this little short guy with these
###123 huge jeans, and then the irony was after a day of shredding
###127 they would get wet, and when the sun would go down, and
###130 you'd be riding in them , and they would turn into these big
###131 bells, these frozen bells, and your leg would just be like in
###136 this thing.
###137 It was like--
###138 it was the worse like coldest trend in snowboarding to date.
###145 But that era was just funny.
###146 But it was like--
###147 it was the whole attitude of the snowboarders and
###150 skateboarders back then, it was like rebellious.
###153 And everybody made fun of you because you wore big jeans,
###155 but you were like yeah that's right.
###157 You don't understand man, you don't understand what I'm
###160 doing with these jeans.
###162 TERJE HAAKONSEN: I met Guch, just kind of
###164 signed up with Burton.
###167 He was riding in big baggy jeans, he had a small bong in
###171 his pocket, he had super long hair, he was from SoCal, he
###176 loves his chips and salsa, and he
###180 introduced me to a few things.
###182 KEVIN JONES: Guch kind of has this lure to him, this like
###185 ninja, Japanese, like mystical Guch, and there's this shot of
###192 him with like-- it's all back-lit and there's just a
###195 huge pony coming off, you know the soul--
###197 you know I'm hardcore, I listen to punk rock music, I
###199 skateboard, but I'm also very soulful.
###205 He's just looking off into the distance like, you don't even
###207 know what I'm looking at right now, what I'm looking at is
###210 totally heavy, and you have no idea.
###215 It was freaking awesome.
###217 BRYAN IGUCHI: I guess--
###219 once I got out of junior--
###220 Well I did that, it's mostly junior college, and once I got
###222 out and moved up to Big Bear, and that was kind of the
###224 beginning of snowboard parks.
###226 That was the first time that a mountain had given like full
###230 permission to just build jumps,
###232 and build these features.
###234 And no one really knew how--
###236 we didn't really know at the time how big to build them or
###238 what really kind of features, so we started experimenting.
###242 The technical aspect of it was just accelerating.
###245 It was like we've built this like skate park, where it was
###248 like kind of bowled corners and banks long runs, and then
###252 gaps, and then we put up rails, and everything.
###254 The riders around were just-- it seemed like every day there
###256 was some new trick going on or there was just really intense
###260 amount of progression happening in that park.
###263 DAVE DOWNING: Bear Mountain was like the only real
###264 snowboard park.
###265 Like they're building jumps and Mike Parillo was like
###268 digging this half pipe with a chainsaw, it was
###271 pretty raw back then.
###274 And Bryan was just definitely the innovator of the whole
###277 group there.
###278 He started doing those like shifty backside 180s off these
###282 hips and stuff and I remember just everybody trying to do
###286 shifty backside 180s like Bryan Iguchi did.
###288 There's this one rainbow rail that is pretty famous, it was
###291 like a piece of a chair lift tower that was just laying in
###294 some scrap pile and Parillo like drug it out and stuck it
###297 in the snow.
###298 That was like one of the first like metal rails in a
###301 snowboard park, Bryan used to just kill all that stuff.
###305 BRYAN IGUCHI: The word got out then people from all over the
###308 place were coming down.
###309 There was people from the Northwest and East coast, and
###312 then people from Europe, and we kind of--
###314 the snowboard park just caught on and pretty much changed the
###318 way people were snowboarding.
###320 It really blew up and it created the X Games.
###325 It just kind of created this environment where snowboarding
###327 could really progress on a level where there is--
###332 there was a lot of spectators, and events, and things.
###337 It seemed like a lot of things were happening at that time.
###340 TERJE HAAKONSEN: He would always do something
###341 amazing on the board.
###342 
###345 He was like the guy who could do a lot out of little.
###348 Guch was really into spinning and all the little jib things,
###352 he was a really good skateboarder, still is.
###356 So there was a lot of jibonks and lot of
###358 tail and nose maneuvers.
###362 BILLY ANDERSON: I guess like one of his influential things
###363 too were just like all the nose butter stuff.
###366 Like that was one of his deals just like spinning around from
###369 his tip to his tail, and ollieing, and bouncing around
###372 with one foot, that was all stuff that no
###376 one had really done.
###378 BRYAN IGUCHI: It was probably two months after I moved to
###380 Big Bear, there was a big pipe contest at Snow Summit, and I
###387 was living in my Jeep and whatever, and I really wanted
###389 to do this contest.
###390 I got started--
###392 ride the bunch and felt like maybe I could do--
###395 maybe I could go pro or whatever, that's
###398 what I wanted to do.
###400 It was the first pro contest I entered and halfway down my
###404 first run my binding broke, and I didn't
###406 qualify for the event.
###408 And I was so bummed, wasted that money.
###411 I don't even know what I was thinking, I was just pissed.
###415 Next day, I went out and I was just riding the pipe at Bear
###418 Mountain, just doing my thing, just sessioning
###420 with a couple friends.
###421 It was a nice day and the pipe was good.
###424 So I was having a good session, and went to take a
###427 break to grab some water, and Tim Pogue was the team manager
###430 of Burton snowboards and he was there with some of the
###433 team and had seen me ride during the contest, or in the
###439 practice for the contest in that morning, and approached
###441 me and gave me his business card, and said, give me a call
###445 in two weeks, I'll be in the office and I'd
###448 love to help you out.
###449 BILLY ANDERSON: It's kind of crazy because when I think
###451 about it I don't think of him as really a progressive pipe
###454 rider for the time.
###455 But then when you start talking about it, he was one
###457 of the ones that was really pushing it at those times.
###461 The early-- and I think it's in A Lively Ride, he does a
###465 cab nine in the pipe, and a bunch of switch stuff, and a
###470 ton of spinning.
###471 I think he was one of the first ones to really kind of
###473 take that up and I think, Hard The Hungry and The Homeless, I
###476 think he was doing some 900s.
###478 PAT BRIDGES: But he was also--
###481 in A Lively Ride, he was doing Alley-Oop McTwists and tail
###483 grabs on this quarter pipe that couldn't have been more
###485 than six feet wide and 10 feet tall.
###487 It was really, really impressive to see.
###491 I mean here's a guy who was buttering, he was trying to
###493 hook 1080s, 9s, off of everything.
###497 And he was ruling on McTwists and stuff like
###500 that, it was sick.
###502 DAVE DOWNING: That's when he was filming The Hard, The
###505 Hungry, and The Homeless.
###506 And then after that, Burton brought Bryan
###509 in and helped him--
###511 Bryan helped Burton develop the twin, which was that
###514 question mark Ouija twin that was pretty famous.
###518 BRYAN IGUCHI: I think it was early enough in snowboarding
###520 there was a big change happening.
###521 It was kind of one of those things you go, well here go
###523 travel with Mack dog and go film, and
###526 then go to these contests.
###527 So we filmed between the contests and kind
###529 of just road tripped.
###530 I just jumped in the car with him, we drove
###531 from event to event.
###533 But it was more of the filming, we would go out and
###536 film, hook up with locals at different
###538 places and go film stuff.
###540 And the project turned out to be The Hard, The Hungry, and
###542 The Homeless, that was the first snowboard
###544 film I'd worked on.
###546 That was where my career kind of shifted to is more the
###549 filming stuff, it was just kind of--
###552 that was gaining in popularity more than the events.
###556 The events were kind of you know I would say pretty well
###560 dominated by Terje and everyone.
###563 And it was just more of a--
###566 I don't know, it just seemed like it was a better
###570 opportunity for me.
###571 DAVE DOWNING: Guchi seemed like he
###572 just came out of nowhere.
###573 And it's interesting because all the other riders, they
###577 still had to do contests and stuff, with the exception of
###580 like Damian, and those guys.
###582 But he was the first pure freestyler who actually just
###584 seemed like first he did movies, then he did contests.
###589 BRYAN IGUCHI: I've never had the best
###591 luck with the contests.
###594 I ended up feeling frustrated a lot at contests.
###600 It's just one of those things, I don't think
###601 competition's easy.
###604 I remember Dave Seoane came up to me at the ASR show in San
###609 Diego and he said he had this concept for
###615 this snowboard movie.
###615 We're going to all jump in these Cadillacs, and drive
###619 around, and road trip around the states, and make a
###620 snowboard movie.
###623 I'm like that sounds awesome, who's going to go?
###625 He's like well I got Terje, and Ranquet, and John Cardiel,
###628 I was like done, let's do this.
###629 We'd go shred all these spots but then we'd go skate as
###633 much, if not more.
###635 It was like on that trip, I remember skating Burnside with
###640 him, and some mini ramps in Colorado.
###643 And just everywhere we went there was like-- we would hook
###646 up with the skaters or we would hook up with the
###648 snowboarders, or whatever.
###651 It was a really cool time.
###652 DAVE DOWNING: He basically took off with Dave Seoane
###655 during the Roadkill filming sessions, he was gone for a
###661 couple months.
###662 I didn't even know what was going on until that movie came
###664 out and then I was like, whoa Bryan was doing that, it's
###668 pretty sick.
###669 PAT BRIDGES: And then you saw him in the Vulcan movies.
###671 A Lively Ride, was the first Vulcan film I saw him in, and
###675 then obviously he had a lot of clips in The Garden.
###679 BRYAN IGUCHI: Throughout the process of making it, we just
###681 kind of went out, OK we're doing Vulcan snow project, and
###684 Wooly the owner, he'd be out in the field with us in the
###687 back country hiking filming the super 8 and Troy Eckert.
###692 It kind of all came together at Sonora Pass in California
###696 and that's where we came up with the name, The Garden.
###698 We would go up there, we'd camp, and hike these jumps,
###701 and we'd have these amazing sessions where it would be
###704 exhausting long days, hiking around, and just having a
###708 blast, and sitting around the campfire at night telling
###712 stories, laughing, and partying just
###715 having a good time.
###716 That's when we were like this is the butterfly garden, this
###720 is The Garden.
###722 This is the movie, this movie's about this, this is
###726 what snowboarding is about.
###728 It's hanging out with your friends, and going out and
###730 finding these places that are special.
###733 It was a really kind of a liberating experience for all
###736 of us to be able to get out from the ski resorts, from the
###739 crowds, and from the crazy park scene
###743 that was blowing up.
###744 I mean, making The Garden was probably still to this day the
###747 highlight of my snowboarding career.
###749 It kind of got me inspired to continue to search, and
###753 explore, and recreate that kind of feeling.
###755 And been trying to keep that dream alive by riding.
