###23 TOM CLARE: The English culture, so many things are
###26 dying out, and we've got so little to hold onto.
###29 And Morris dancing is one of those things that goes back
###32 hundreds of years.
###34 
###37 I'm undertaking a journey from Olympia, in Greece, all the
###41 way to the Olympic Games opening ceremony in London.
###44 I hope that my humble effort has a little bit of the
###48 Olympic feel to it.
###49 
###57 I think I could have Morris danced the
###59 entire 2000 mile journey.
###62 Perhaps a little bit of support, and a bit more time
###67 to be able to do it comfortably.
###69 I really enjoyed dancing through Greece.
###71 I got a fantastic reception there.
###73 It was very much like being in England with lots of people
###76 waving and cheering.
###78 And coming into France, I've had a really
###80 good reaction, too.
###82 
###84 Last night I was underneath a motorway bridge, hiding from a
###88 thunderstorm, eating cold beans, questioning is it
###93 really worth it?
###93 But then when I get to cycle into the city, and dance in
###97 the city, the feel of elevation I get, and when I
###101 see a smile on someone's face, it's definitely worth it.
###104 
###108 I don't have a woman waiting for me at home.
###110 I'm not sure that a woman would let
###113 me go on this adventure.
###115 So I'm staying free and enjoying it at the moment.
###120 It
###127 KEVIN BLOWE: On the 27th of April, a dispersal zone was
###130 created for an area that surrounds
###133 Stratford town center.
###134 If there's more than two people together at any
###137 particular point, police and police community support
###141 officers can demand that people disperse.
###146 What the dispersal zone does is exactly the same as the
###148 powers of stop and search.
###149 It's about stigmatizing people.
###151 It's making an assumption that everybody who is of a certain
###153 age is likely to be causing some sort of nuisance to the
###157 visitors that are turning up here.
###159 It's based on a fear of young people.
###161 It's based on the assumption that
###162 everybody's up to no good.
###164 There's also a power that if you're under 16 and you're out
###169 after 9 o'clock at night--
###170 and bear in mind, we're talking about the summer--
###172 you can be picked up by the police.
###174 And effectively what it's done is create a curfew for anybody
###177 under the age of 16 between the hours of 9 and 6 anywhere
###180 around this site.
###182 MALE SPEAKER: The idea there is good.
###185 To keep everyone safe.
###186 I could respect that.
###187 But the whole fact that without any reason, like, if
###191 you look suspicious, we'll have to remove you from the
###194 whole bother.
###195 That's a bit extreme.
###197 MALE SPEAKER: Olympics is only happening now.
###199 And we've been hanging around here full time.
###202 We're happy that tourists are coming, and they have the
###204 right to be here.
###205 But we also have our rights to hang with our
###208 friends and have fun.
###210 KEVIN BLOWE: A lot of young people are not prepared to put
###213 up with just being told what to do, forcing people into a
###216 situation where they get into conflict with the police.
###219 A natural consequence of that is people end up being
###221 criminalized.
###221 People end up in court.
###223 
###228 MALE SPEAKER: We should have a right to be around where we
###231 live and hang around our area.
###233 
###238 LEAH BORROMEO: Do Londoners feel safer when they're
###241 walking through the streets and they suddenly find armed
###244 police with big guns?
###245 I mean, not in a country that rather prides itself in having
###248 an unarmed police force.
###250 However, we are already the most surveyed society.
###253 We've now got drones coming in over the sky.
###256 You hear the sounds of military helicopters.
###258 Do we really want to be living in a kind of
###260 Ridley Scott wet dream?
###262 
###268 BRIAN WHELAN: Well, starting from tomorrow, there's going
###271 to be armed police at my door, 10 soldiers stationed, 24/7,
###277 at the end of the corridor, and a battery of missiles on
###281 the roof of the water tower above my apartment.
###284 If you look at the Olympic site, the first thing you see
###286 is my building and the roof of that water tower.
###288 Maybe if you see missiles on the top of that,
###290 maybe you feel safe.
###291 If the [INAUDIBLE] comes out and says, look, we're putting
###294 missiles on the roof of people's houses, it makes it
###297 look like they're really serious about security.
###299 But I think the proper work of keeping the Olympics safe is
###304 done elsewhere.
###304 Those missiles are just for show.
###307 LT.
###307 COL.
###307 JAMES PHILLIPS: Behind me, we have the Rapier Air Defense
###310 missile system.
###311 Four of those will be deployed on Exercise Olympic Guardian.
###314 There is no specific threat against the Olympics in terms
###317 of an air threat.
###318 This is purely a contingency.
###319 But obviously we need to prepare for if
###322 that order does come.
###323 
###327 KEVIN BLOWE: Overall security for the Olympic Park has
###329 increased from round about 4,000 to
###331 somewhere like 23,000.
###333 Which includes G4S, the police, the army, in uniform,
###337 and then all the other security
###339 from private sponsors.
###341 500 FBI agents coming over with the team from the US.
###344 It's complete overkill for what is a sporting event.
###347 The security is predominantly about defending the interests
###349 of the money that's gone into the Olympics.
###352 PROTESTORS: G4S!
###353 You can't hide!
###355 We charge you with aparthied!
###357 G4S!
###359 You can't hide!
###360 We charge you with aparthied!
###363 MICHAEL DEAS: There's lots of lovely things
###365 said about the Olympics.
###367 But if you're hiring a company to provide the security that's
###370 involved in supporting Israeli apartheid, that's involved in
###373 exploiting prisoners in the UK, it's killed asylum seekers
###378 and immigrants in the UK, then I think that's really
###380 undermining the message of the Olympics.
###382 SARA CALLAWAY: In the case of Jimmy Mubenga, the officers
###385 deporting him pushed his head down, they kept him in a
###388 position where he asphyxiated.
###390 
###393 G4S claimed that they've done nothing wrong.
###395 But even their own employees came forward, saying that they
###398 were doing this all the time-- these very violent and
###401 basically murderous procedures.
###403 
###411 STEPHEN BAYLEY: Any sane person could be against the
###413 idea of the Olympics.
###414 Anything which brings prosperity and vitality and
###418 activity to London is obviously a good thing.
###422 However, that said, if you are a fastidious aesthete--
###425 which is one of several definitions I apply to
###428 myself-- if you are a fastidious aesthete, you can
###433 only be appalled at the brainless detritus which the
###437 Olympics generate.
###440 I was recently described as a ubiquitous know-it-all.
###443 I'm an author and journalist, but in the past I was
###445 responsible for making London's design museum.
###448 I was briefly, hilariously, and catastrophically the
###451 creative director of the Millennium Dome.
###454 And that gave me special insights into politicized
###457 projects, which often end in disaster.
###460 I'm an expert on those.
###462 And what's deplorable about the Olympic merchandise, and
###467 the terrible graphics going with it, it assumes a very low
###471 level of intelligence amongst the public.
###473 And I think that is really despicable.
###478 Look upon my works, ye mighty, and despair.
###481 I think the idea that the mascot's there to excite
###484 younger children reveals the deplorable ignorance of how
###487 intelligent and sensitive young children are.
###489 Young children are not moronic.
###490 But I think some parts of the Olympic organizing committee
###494 probably are moronic.
###495 How is the person who consumes this bit of tat going to be
###499 changed or enhanced by possession of it?
###501 It's ugly, it's cynical, and it's stupid.
###505 Several design principles have been violated here.
###508 This is an ugly travesty.
###510 Mindless, stupid, cynical, patronizing, exploitative,
###516 manipulative, ugly, and useless.
###519 We want to revive our industry and revive the credibility of
###522 our great nation by putting something like this for sale?
###527 I mean, what purpose is this meant to serve?
###530 It's not a clever photograph.
###532 And it shows this sort of laborious conceit of the
###536 London eye as a target.
###539 Given the ever-present threat of terrorist activity, that
###542 seems to me to be an unfortunate lapse of taste.
###546 But I think al Qaeda, their aesthetics are too advanced to
###550 take much interest in this sort of thing.
###552 The local Olympic organizers seem to think that the public
###556 has absolutely no appetite for thoughtful speculation about
###561 what the Olympics might be, about what competition might
###563 be, about the nature of sport, the nature of participative
###567 activity, the symbolic importance of the games in a
###571 modern culture.
###572 Instead, what the public, they think, needs is distorted,
###576 debased Smurfs which you can hang on a key rings.
###579 Appalling.
###581 
###584 MALE SPEAKER: I would say I'm a pinhead.
###587 I've been called a pinhead, yes.
###589 It's more than just collecting pins.
###591 It breaks down barriers.
###592 It makes it easy for people to meet each other.
###595 MALE SPEAKER: This is now the eighth meet that we've had.
###598 For me, the pins are a tangible memento.
###600 This has really taken over my life.
###601 MALE SPEAKER: The reason I love this logo--
###604 one, it's very, very distinctive.
###606 Two, it's creative.
###607 Absolutely amazing level of discussion over it.
###611 I think when it first came out, we all
###613 said ew, what's that?
###614 That's not a great look.
###615 Over time, we've come to accept it a lot more.
###617 Given what we have the marketplace, I think our logo
###620 is pretty good.
###621 MALE SPEAKER: It's going to become the biggest global
###624 brand this year because of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
###628
