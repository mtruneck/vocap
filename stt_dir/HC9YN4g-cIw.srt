do that again.

think the loop is?

BILL BRYANT: It says that
it's 100 to Cabo.


18

So we would come down that.

21
0:1:2,56 --> 0:1:4,18
We might just go straight.

0:1:5,7 --> 0:1:8,4
what Chris was saying, let's
just go to Pescadero, set up


24

at, where everything is, and

0:1:10,0 --> 0:1:12,2
then just ride down to Cabo.

we can drive up.

can go, though.

53
0:2:5,76 --> 0:2:6,8
I'd seen Cabo from a boat.

as La Paz before.

But I'd never been in that
stretch in between.

attention to the riding so

on it for free.

all day.

to do that again.

This is not good.


404
0:19:51,67 --> 0:19:53,365
At least he's not laying
out in the road.


405
0:19:53,365 --> 0:19:56,11
He's sitting up, which
means he's alert.


406
0:19:56,11 --> 0:20:0,22
And can't be dead if he's
sitting up on his bike.


407
0:20:0,22 --> 0:20:3,16
Because the way the bike
looked was shocking.


408
0:20:3,16 --> 0:20:6,9
You don't see a Harley turned
on its side without some


409
0:20:6,9 --> 0:20:9,38
damage to man and machine.


410
0:20:9,38 --> 0:20:11,5
Had that been a day when
somebody was wearing skate


411
0:20:11,5 --> 0:20:17,6
shoes and a t-shirt, it would
have been a lot worse.


412
0:20:17,6 --> 0:20:18,4
KEEGAN SAUDER: If I hadn't have
been wearing that helmet,


413
0:20:18,4 --> 0:20:21,13
I might be dead.


414
0:20:21,13 --> 0:20:22,39
-[INAUDIBLE]


415
0:20:22,39 --> 0:20:23,95
KEEGAN SAUDER: I took
it off forever.


416
0:20:23,95 --> 0:20:26,76
And then yesterday
I did that skid.


417
0:20:26,76 --> 0:20:29,227
And then Harvey's like, you
should wear a helmet.


418
0:20:29,227 --> 0:20:33,63
So I was like, OK, I'm taking
Harvey's advice.


419
0:20:33,63 --> 0:20:35,63
I was tumbling.


420
0:20:35,63 --> 0:20:38,7
The tank slappers, the
handlebars, it's just like,


421
0:20:38,7 --> 0:20:39,94
build up, more and more.


422
0:20:39,94 --> 0:20:42,65
And then it's [WOOSH].


423
0:20:42,65 --> 0:20:44,5
I could feel that
helmet hitting--


424
0:20:44,5 --> 0:20:45,15
[WOOSH]


425
0:20:45,15 --> 0:20:47,9
I could feel it hitting
rocks and stuff, too.


426
0:20:47,9 --> 0:20:50,752
That would have split
my head open.


427
0:20:50,752 --> 0:20:54,6
Maybe I'll slow down now.


428
0:20:54,6 --> 0:20:55,312
That's the moral.


429
0:20:55,312 --> 0:20:58,204
-All right.


430
0:20:58,204 --> 0:20:59,454
Don't scratch it now.


431
0:20:59,454 --> 0:21:2,542



432
0:21:2,542 --> 0:21:3,52
HARVEY FOSTER: Look at
this stuff, dude.


433
0:21:3,52 --> 0:21:5,975
The holes could be gouges
in your ribs.


434
0:21:5,975 --> 0:21:8,386
KEEGAN SAUDER: There was a
fucking machete sticking off


435
0:21:8,386 --> 0:21:8,7
the back.


436
0:21:8,7 --> 0:21:9,67
-The machete.


437
0:21:9,67 --> 0:21:11,62
KEEGAN SAUDER: What if
it had landed on me?


438
0:21:11,62 --> 0:21:12,77
-I've thought of that
so many times.


439
0:21:12,77 --> 0:21:16,4
Like, dude, there's a machete
right here, sticking up.


440
0:21:16,4 --> 0:21:17,15
HARVEY FOSTER: I said
that to you too.


441
0:21:17,15 --> 0:21:18,82
I was like, dude, are you
sure that's safe?


442
0:21:18,82 --> 0:21:19,965
And you're like, oh, yeah.


443
0:21:19,965 --> 0:21:21,92
It's totally fine.


444
0:21:21,92 --> 0:21:23,94
-All the shit happens.


445
0:21:23,94 --> 0:21:25,5
And you have--


446
0:21:25,5 --> 0:21:26,5
KEEGAN SAUDER: I don't know
how the fuck [INAUDIBLE].


447
0:21:26,5 --> 0:21:27,5
-You're going to be sore.


448
0:21:27,5 --> 0:21:29,8
KEEGAN SAUDER: I got
away with it.


449
0:21:29,8 --> 0:21:29,87
-No road rash.


450
0:21:29,87 --> 0:21:30,61
No--


451
0:21:30,61 --> 0:21:31,107
-Oh, yeah.


452
0:21:31,107 --> 0:21:32,357
Rib cage.


453
0:21:32,357 --> 0:21:38,65



454
0:21:38,65 --> 0:21:41,312
KEEGAN SAUDER: That's
the worst one.


455
0:21:41,312 --> 0:21:43,4
-That would have been all
on the top of your head.


456
0:21:43,4 --> 0:21:47,8



457
0:21:47,8 --> 0:21:48,77
KEEGAN SAUDER: I could've
just been dead.


458
0:21:48,77 --> 0:21:54,41



459
0:21:54,41 --> 0:21:58,29
-That little fucking ball.


460
0:21:58,29 --> 0:22:0,23
HARVEY FOSTER: Because
you rode through it.


461
0:22:0,23 --> 0:22:2,17
You rode through it too.


462
0:22:2,17 --> 0:22:4,11
I'm psyched on you guys
for doing that.


463
0:22:4,11 --> 0:22:5,525
That's a good ride.


464
0:22:5,525 --> 0:22:6,21
I did it too.


465
0:22:6,21 --> 0:22:17,67
[ROCK]


466
0:22:17,67 --> 0:22:20,535
ARTO SAARI: I'll go on a
motorcycle trip to anywhere.


467
0:22:20,535 --> 0:22:22,0
Tierra de Fuego.


468
0:22:22,0 --> 0:22:23,43
That's it, right?


469
0:22:23,43 --> 0:22:24,87
Tierra del Fuego.


470
0:22:24,87 --> 0:22:27,54
The tip of fire.


471
0:22:27,54 --> 0:22:29,39
Alaska's one place
I want to go.


472
0:22:29,39 --> 0:22:33,61
And fucking tip of fire is
one place I want to go.


473
0:22:33,61 --> 0:22:37,931
If you can combine the two,
it would be most apex.


474
0:22:37,931 --> 0:22:44,16
[ROCK]


475
0:22:44,16 --> 0:22:45,63
ARTO SAARI: Or start
from the bottom.


476
0:22:45,63 --> 0:22:45,93
Fuck.


477
0:22:45,93 --> 0:22:46,73
Who knows?


478
0:22:46,73 --> 0:22:50,13
Go all the way up and then take
the Bering Strait across


479
0:22:50,13 --> 0:22:56,18
to Russia, take the Road of
Bones, Mongolia, side by side


480
0:22:56,18 --> 0:22:59,83
Siberian Express, or even
ride on the tracks.


481
0:22:59,83 --> 0:23:1,8
Go to Scando.


482
0:23:1,8 --> 0:23:6,668



483
0:23:6,668 --> 0:23:10,572
Go up Norway all the way
down to Morocco, the


484
0:23:10,572 --> 0:23:13,58
southern tip of Africa.


485
0:23:13,58 --> 0:23:18,74



486
0:23:18,74 --> 0:23:21,444
Retire in Australia.


487
0:23:21,444 --> 0:23:23,924
-Jesus.


488
0:23:23,924 --> 0:23:25,574
-What you just said
there was--


489
0:23:25,574 --> 0:23:26,56
-You're a real go-getter.


490
0:23:26,56 --> 0:23:31,82
ARTO SAARI: Fucking go get her
done while you're at it.


491
0:23:31,82 --> 0:23:34,47
So what's going on with
these beers, anyway?


492
0:23:34,47 --> 0:23:39,66
It's as important as fuel at
this point of the trip.


493
0:23:39,66 --> 0:23:40,91
This is very important.


494
0:23:40,91 --> 0:25:40,91
