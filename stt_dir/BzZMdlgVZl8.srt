1
0:0:0,38 --> 0:0:4,47
during these david shuster host to take
action news on we act radio on take


2
0:0:4,47 --> 0:0:8,95
action news dot com and also on you tube
that you too dot com slash take action


3
0:0:8,95 --> 0:0:13,629
news t_v_ david idoney should probably
build up to this but i just want to get


4
0:0:13,629 --> 0:0:16,79
right into the good stuff that i know
people want to know right away so from


5
0:0:16,79 --> 0:0:18,89
from ninety-six the two thousand two


6
0:0:18,89 --> 0:0:23,189
you were of washington d_c_-based
correspondent for fox news channel and


7
0:0:23,189 --> 0:0:27,999
then you went on to msnbc so when you
were at foxnews


8
0:0:27,999 --> 0:0:33,399
explicit is the right wing talking point
point of view in terms of the direction


9
0:0:33,399 --> 0:0:36,28
that that and on air staff get


10
0:0:36,28 --> 0:0:40,29
approx was a very different organization
back and then it is now when i joined


11
0:0:40,29 --> 0:0:43,71
fox news i've been a local reporter
little rock arkansas though i had led


12
0:0:43,71 --> 0:0:46,79
them on local stations covered to the
whitewater investigation i really good


13
0:0:46,79 --> 0:0:48,9
contacts and ken starr's office


14
0:0:48,9 --> 0:0:51,84
with the flats news hired me to
washington to essentially keep track of


15
0:0:51,84 --> 0:0:53,95
white water case and when anywhere


16
0:0:53,95 --> 0:0:56,58
and then when the monica lewinsky
scandal broke a lot of the prosecutors


17
0:0:56,58 --> 0:0:59,94
are covered in arkansas they were then
working for stars like a great contacts


18
0:0:59,94 --> 0:1:2,24
in the office of independent counsel


19
0:1:2,24 --> 0:1:6,61
and i never really had any um issue with
fox outbid saying do a store display or


20
0:1:6,61 --> 0:1:8,48
door don't do it that way


21
0:1:8,48 --> 0:1:10,42
are the biggest problem and have worked
with


22
0:1:10,42 --> 0:1:13,58
some of the on-air talent uh... some of
the host to a cake that sort of


23
0:1:13,58 --> 0:1:17,6
carefully crafted information about the
whitewater investigation


24
0:1:17,6 --> 0:1:21,49
for about the monica lewinsky scandal
and take it out of context and use it


25
0:1:21,49 --> 0:1:24,34
for their own agenda but that was a sort
of a constant battle charlie


26
0:1:24,34 --> 0:1:28,619
we would also get their memos from other
head of the sort of editorial planter


27
0:1:28,619 --> 0:1:32,119
boxes saying here's the types of stories
we're gonna be following but i didn't


28
0:1:32,119 --> 0:1:33,799
really think that there was a m


29
0:1:33,799 --> 0:1:35,19
our heavy hand


30
0:1:35,19 --> 0:1:39,16
or a unattractive sort of right wing
hand on fox news until really uh...


31
0:1:39,16 --> 0:1:41,789
starting with the porter recounted two
thousand


32
0:1:41,789 --> 0:1:44,68
and then it became or i_v_f_ and that's
what i felt like wow


33
0:1:44,68 --> 0:1:46,479
maybe this isn't that a great place for
me


34
0:1:46,479 --> 0:1:51,329
right said you were on the you decide to
thousand i don't know if it's staffer or


35
0:1:51,329 --> 0:1:54,56
whatever you were part of you decide to
thousands and and everything that took


36
0:1:54,56 --> 0:1:58,14
place around the two thousand election
so at that point


37
0:1:58,14 --> 0:2:2,79
as things were developing with the
supreme court and with the greek counts


38
0:2:2,79 --> 0:2:4,689
in all of the stuff was there any kind
of


39
0:2:4,689 --> 0:2:9,319
uh... of concerted decision about what
the point of view would be is it just


40
0:2:9,319 --> 0:2:11,79
kind of known what it would be


41
0:2:11,79 --> 0:2:15,1
well it became pretty obvious to me and
i i had that cover the john mccain


42
0:2:15,1 --> 0:2:18,989
campaign and it felt like it a lot more
sort of a apt word to try to get me to


43
0:2:18,989 --> 0:2:22,53
do negative stories about john mccain
and the two thousand republican primary


44
0:2:22,53 --> 0:2:25,599
tend to get the guy who is covering
george w_ bush to do negative stories


45
0:2:25,599 --> 0:2:26,7
about him


46
0:2:26,7 --> 0:2:29,87
so i felt like the network it management
attempt was more sort of in the george


47
0:2:29,87 --> 0:2:32,559
w_ bush camp is enjoying the floor to
recount


48
0:2:32,559 --> 0:2:34,889
i've got to tell happy for a for four
weeks


49
0:2:34,889 --> 0:2:39,199
where became so apparently is that uh...
you recall that on election night when


50
0:2:39,199 --> 0:2:43,359
all the networks got it wrong one of the
talking points from the republicans with


51
0:2:43,359 --> 0:2:47,719
that well the network had not called the
state of florida when they did


52
0:2:47,719 --> 0:2:50,339
thousands of voters in the panhandle
forum would not have been


53
0:2:50,339 --> 0:2:53,919
disenfranchised and they keep in mind
for the polls colton portable pathetic


54
0:2:53,919 --> 0:2:57,469
seven o'clock and then the panhandle
which is a central time zone it actually


55
0:2:57,469 --> 0:2:58,339
cause of that


56
0:2:58,339 --> 0:3:1,369
seven o'clock central time which is
eight o'clock eastern the networks


57
0:3:1,369 --> 0:3:3,719
called florida for gore initially


58
0:3:3,719 --> 0:3:7,69
hand gel until the argument was oh my
god or thousands of conservative


59
0:3:7,69 --> 0:3:8,12
republicans in the


60
0:3:8,12 --> 0:3:9,4
the panhandle of florida


61
0:3:9,4 --> 0:3:13,93
that didn't vote at the network and that
call detroit for al gore than george w_


62
0:3:13,93 --> 0:3:15,7
bush would've won the vote period


63
0:3:15,7 --> 0:3:19,28
that was a talking point on election
night in for several days afterwards


64
0:3:19,28 --> 0:3:22,89
what fox news there to take that one of
my colleagues


65
0:3:22,89 --> 0:3:23,599
guy by the name of brett there


66
0:3:23,599 --> 0:3:25,14
right of the panhandle


67
0:3:25,14 --> 0:3:29,0
to flying the thousands of republican
voters who had heard that al gore one


68
0:3:29,0 --> 0:3:31,569
quarter were disenfranchised who decided
not to vote


69
0:3:31,569 --> 0:3:35,239
and brad couldn't find any of them
pianist exhibit in advance there were no


70
0:3:35,239 --> 0:3:38,799
people if they were waiting in line a
quarter of the vote anyway racking up by


71
0:3:38,799 --> 0:3:41,59
many people think even come to
tallahassee tells me


72
0:3:41,59 --> 0:3:44,62
you know there's parking for this
republican party point is wrong


73
0:3:44,62 --> 0:3:47,43
after all when you're gonna do the story
then write your get a report that there


74
0:3:47,43 --> 0:3:49,8
is there were none of these you
thousands of people that we're getting


75
0:3:49,8 --> 0:3:52,709
franchise that in fact al gore that the
networks


76
0:3:52,709 --> 0:3:55,9
that george will be which would not have
won the overall bpl regardless of the


77
0:3:55,9 --> 0:3:56,739
networks did


78
0:3:56,739 --> 0:3:58,709
he said no i'm not gonna do that story


79
0:3:58,709 --> 0:4:2,499
and i said whoa wind up in our job as
you go a report and we've got people on


80
0:4:2,499 --> 0:4:4,989
the air right now saying that george
will be bush


81
0:4:4,989 --> 0:4:7,93
would've won florida had not been for
the networking to god


82
0:4:7,93 --> 0:4:11,79
i'm just not you know i'm just not to do
this try not to rock the boat


83
0:4:11,79 --> 0:4:14,969
and that's when i realized that ok but
did have an agenda to sort of left of


84
0:4:14,969 --> 0:4:18,34
talking point be out there that george
will be bush would've won had it not


85
0:4:18,34 --> 0:4:19,6
been for network


86
0:4:19,6 --> 0:4:24,18
and i felt like dad brett bear is going
to a very far parking is news channel


87
0:4:24,18 --> 0:4:24,869
because


88
0:4:24,869 --> 0:4:28,189
he's playing to management he's not as
the third cling to journalism and that


89
0:4:28,189 --> 0:4:28,77
was


90
0:4:28,77 --> 0:4:32,61
you know there was a choice that he may
tie was done but i was disturbed by a


91
0:4:32,61 --> 0:4:35,24
control like no that's not the truth but
i would have made


92
0:4:35,24 --> 0:4:39,16
and when i was in florida are reported
what i was finding and that is both i'd


93
0:4:39,16 --> 0:4:42,919
we're working like hell to try to win
the recap the more shenanigans on both


94
0:4:42,919 --> 0:4:46,639
sides it wasn't just al gore that was
you know trying to


95
0:4:46,639 --> 0:4:49,599
touring certain things that wasn't just
george w_ bush


96
0:4:49,599 --> 0:4:52,66
but the network starting in the porter
recant had very much a manage end of


97
0:4:52,66 --> 0:4:56,169
today al gore's trying to steal the
thing so that's a pretty candid


98
0:4:56,169 --> 0:4:59,879
discussion to have with brett there who
now hosts the six p_m_ news hour he's


99
0:4:59,879 --> 0:5:3,25
one of the main fox news guys at this
point you were writing your for your


100
0:5:3,25 --> 0:5:5,699
prediction that he would go far with
that point of view


101
0:5:5,699 --> 0:5:8,5
and he basically just admit it you know
it's it's it's gonna it's gonna stirred


102
0:5:8,5 --> 0:5:12,61
things up if i report that i missed does
not gonna talk about it all do you find


103
0:5:12,61 --> 0:5:16,619
that this kind two sites that we saw the
bills salmon memos were they say


104
0:5:16,619 --> 0:5:21,9
faces how we're gonna talk about health
care and that's like a very proactive


105
0:5:21,9 --> 0:5:25,18
way to push basically republican talking
points but you're talking about a


106
0:5:25,18 --> 0:5:29,249
different thing which is just the
exclusion of certain stories that might


107
0:5:29,249 --> 0:5:34,15
conflict with the party lines so so it's
really it's like a two-sided approach


108
0:5:34,15 --> 0:5:37,71
absolutely and it's just i mean by then
apply them perfectly the one side would


109
0:5:37,71 --> 0:5:38,72
be the holes


110
0:5:38,72 --> 0:5:41,77
who you know that the people who hold
certain shows soon they will express


111
0:5:41,77 --> 0:5:45,36
whatever opinion a bill famine or
somebody for management and in a memo


112
0:5:45,36 --> 0:5:48,759
they will we need that into their
commentary to their discussion


113
0:5:48,759 --> 0:5:52,499
and in effect inside is involve the
people who consider themselves to be


114
0:5:52,499 --> 0:5:56,309
reporters and that is they will report
uncertain stories and they will not


115
0:5:56,309 --> 0:5:57,25
touch


116
0:5:57,25 --> 0:6:0,87
other stories and felt you know folks
like a breath there are other people who


117
0:6:0,87 --> 0:6:2,99
considered themselves journalist


118
0:6:2,99 --> 0:6:6,379
they will do an admirable job with the
story that they are prepared under the


119
0:6:6,379 --> 0:6:8,22
story they are asked to cover


120
0:6:8,22 --> 0:6:11,61
but there's a whole range of stories
that these reports even they make their


121
0:6:11,61 --> 0:6:15,629
hey we should go cover this story over
here apart his mental state not knowing


122
0:6:15,629 --> 0:6:19,4
racket cover that's where we're not
going to talk about that in some time


123
0:6:19,4 --> 0:6:21,89
the absolute of covering stories
particularly ones that


124
0:6:21,89 --> 0:6:23,8
kichu in the face


125
0:6:23,8 --> 0:6:25,259
that's where the bias and show up


126
0:6:25,259 --> 0:6:28,37
so let's talk a little bit about msnbc
because we get out


127
0:6:28,37 --> 0:6:33,9
beyond the on the progress of side of
independent media myself i hear tooth to


128
0:6:33,9 --> 0:6:36,479
kind of opinions about msnbc what is
people who really like it and they like


129
0:6:36,479 --> 0:6:40,25
rachel maddow and uh... and they like
everything that's going on on the


130
0:6:40,25 --> 0:6:43,58
channel and others who say you know the
keith olbermann thing is really just


131
0:6:43,58 --> 0:6:45,52
kind of an example keith olbermann


132
0:6:45,52 --> 0:6:48,8
uh... the controversy over his political
donations and and eventually leaving the


133
0:6:48,8 --> 0:6:55,229
channel is really an example that msnbc
has chosen as a profit product to have


134
0:6:55,229 --> 0:6:59,509
editorially more progressive uh...
commentator's but really that it's


135
0:6:59,509 --> 0:7:3,729
indistinguishable for from fox news in
the sense that they both urges corporate


136
0:7:3,729 --> 0:7:7,389
media putting out the product they think
will make them the most money rachel


137
0:7:7,389 --> 0:7:10,97
maddow has come back and said now you
know these are both for-profit companies


138
0:7:10,97 --> 0:7:16,9
but there's a huge difference between
the kind of of decidedly right wing


139
0:7:16,9 --> 0:7:20,55
talking points that purveyed the
supposedly news coverage on fox and


140
0:7:20,55 --> 0:7:25,38
msnbc having liberal opinion programming
having worked for both what's your take


141
0:7:25,38 --> 0:7:27,259
how do you compare them


142
0:7:27,259 --> 0:7:30,36
well well have a great question in a
greater an electrician and that is i


143
0:7:30,36 --> 0:7:34,999
would play a couple of things yes bearer
is a uh... there if the buyer from both


144
0:7:34,999 --> 0:7:38,869
died in once upon a time i would have
had foxnews far more conservative than


145
0:7:38,869 --> 0:7:41,8
m_f_n_ if you could ever be quotable


146
0:7:41,8 --> 0:7:44,39
old liberal these however i would think
that it started to doubt that a little


147
0:7:44,39 --> 0:7:47,27
bit more that put that them a permit to
become much more sort of progressive


148
0:7:47,27 --> 0:7:51,229
liberal uh... than before and then
certainly when i started their but a


149
0:7:51,229 --> 0:7:54,31
couple of things i would also argue
though that the rachel maddow things


150
0:7:54,31 --> 0:7:55,83
that people remains


151
0:7:55,83 --> 0:8:0,459
uh... and shold though i prefer rapid
it's much more money fact-based approach


152
0:8:0,459 --> 0:8:3,679
and i think that's also been something
the progress of the loan thing tivoli


153
0:8:3,679 --> 0:8:6,8
tell you that progress is tell me look


154
0:8:6,8 --> 0:8:7,699
we don't want the parliament


155
0:8:7,699 --> 0:8:9,12
the out but we simply want that


156
0:8:9,12 --> 0:8:12,479
fact-based affiant based discussion of
these issues


157
0:8:12,479 --> 0:8:15,8
and therefore i think you know they have
a committee commentators do a better job


158
0:8:15,8 --> 0:8:19,389
in five pin that yes you may think will
reach a battle at the point of view


159
0:8:19,389 --> 0:8:23,94
or lord of da doran chilled but they
tend to be they can do it here to fax


160
0:8:23,94 --> 0:8:26,49
and basic


161
0:8:26,49 --> 0:8:28,52
much more than a strict spectra fashion


162
0:8:28,52 --> 0:8:31,96
and you get on the opposite side over at
fox news and that frankly the


163
0:8:31,96 --> 0:8:33,159
differences that you could


164
0:8:33,159 --> 0:8:36,39
and i think that the funding of programs
of local say of court


165
0:8:36,39 --> 0:8:39,19
progressive i think most progresses
we'll tell you if you have it backbase


166
0:8:39,19 --> 0:8:40,44
discussion


167
0:8:40,44 --> 0:8:43,82
progresses again win seventy percent of
the time and i think that seems to be


168
0:8:43,82 --> 0:8:47,47
what i hear from put my former
colleagues at msnbc they just want to


169
0:8:47,47 --> 0:8:48,689
have a arduous


170
0:8:48,689 --> 0:8:51,6
arg of very arduous


171
0:8:51,6 --> 0:8:54,98
uh... on point discussion that in fact
based


172
0:8:54,98 --> 0:8:58,1
and and they believe that their progress
in point of view will win


173
0:8:58,1 --> 0:9:3,43
lastname we saw after the twenty twelve
election results viewers tuning out


174
0:9:3,43 --> 0:9:7,76
allot from fox news their ratings have
while they're still very good in the


175
0:9:7,76 --> 0:9:9,23
kind of aggregate sens


176
0:9:9,23 --> 0:9:12,89
in in the key demographics in prime time
they've been lower than they they were


177
0:9:12,89 --> 0:9:15,44
since before tonight eleven in fact


178
0:9:15,44 --> 0:9:19,58
what do you think this is a response to
is this just some fifty dash they're


179
0:9:19,58 --> 0:9:24,29
losing an election or could this be kind
of the start of a longer term shift away


180
0:9:24,29 --> 0:9:26,0
from that type of program


181
0:9:26,0 --> 0:9:29,81
i think it's part of a longer term ship
i mean the credibility gap and fox news


182
0:9:29,81 --> 0:9:33,1
had been there for a long time and i
think it is finally catching up with
