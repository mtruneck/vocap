###0 CHRIS GROSSO: Hi.
###0 My name is Chris Grosso.
###1 I'm a producer here at Vice.com and the first show I
###4 ever got to work on was Epicly Later'd.
###5 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###12 CHRIS GROSSO: So this episode of Epicly Later'd is centered
###14 around Andrew Reynolds' madness.
###16 Andrew Reynolds is obviously one of the best skaters in the
###20 world and has been for a long time.
###23 This episode focuses on him trying to film a trick for
###27 what was then his upcoming video Stay Gold.
###31 We actually have a doctor from Columbia University in this
###35 episode and he explains what the actual breakdown is for
###40 OCD, in particular, OCD for a skateboarder.
###44 Vice presents Epicly Later'd Andrew Reynolds' Madness.
###47 
###63 
###94 MALE SPEAKER: Neckface was telling me he saw you try a
###96 trick and it was hat nine times.
###98 ANDREW REYNOLDS: Nine, yeah.
###98 Like before I go to bed at night I go to the door and I
###103 lock it nine times but like 3,3,3.
###108 3,3,3.
###109 3,3,3.
###109 And I do that three times.
###113 And then sometimes I'm laying down and I'm
###114 like, did I do it?
###115 And I go back.
###116 And then it's like once I did that, then it has to be the
###119 nine, the whole thing, 3,3,3.
###122 3,3,3.
###122 3,3,3.
###123 Three times, and then if I messed up and did it, then I
###126 have to do that whole thing three times.
###128 You know what I mean?
###131 PATRICK O'DELL: All right.
###131 Welcome back to the show.
###132 This episode is about Andrew Reynolds.
###136 I've said this about every guest so far but Andrew really
###139 is the best skater.
###141 There's no one that can skate big stuff like him as stylish
###145 as he does.
###147 He'll do an ollie inward heelflip down all these stairs
###152 and it looks like flat-ground.
###155 This episode I went on a little trip to San Francisco
###158 and I filmed him trying to trick down
###160 the Wallenberg Four.
###161 Kind of what I wanted to focus on was what he calls "madness"
###164 where he has to do all these little rituals.
###167 It means a lot to me to have a skater like Andrew talk to me
###172 and talk about these weird tics he has.
###176 And that's what this episode's about, it's
###178 just the madness episode.
###179 
###182 I'm going to ask you just what madness is?
###185 ANDREW REYNOLDS: All right.
###185 Well, it's basically obsessive compulsive disorder.
###190 And it comes on really strong when I'm doing tricks and I'm
###197 skating and I'm kind of scared.
###198 I think it has something to do with being scared or having
###201 some anxiety from having to try the trick.
###203 Wherever you skate there's cracks in the ground and
###206 there's signs and there's people around.
###208 And pretty much it ends up being this thing where I have
###214 to do three things three times.
###217 
###222 I do like three taps a lot of times.
###225 It could start with just like, [TAPPING], and then by the end
###229 it could be [TAPPING]
###231 that, and then like [TAPPING]
###235 that and then it could be three taps and then it could
###238 be, Patrick, you ready?
###240 Tepa, ready?
###242 So and so, you ready?
###244 Back.
###245 Tepa, you ready?
###246 And then make sure the coast is clear, there's no people,
###249 and then go.
###250 
###253 [CHEERING]
###255 ANDREW REYNOLDS: I don't know what it does.
###256 I don't even know why I do it but for me, I think, why I do
###260 it is because I get all this little bullshit stuff out of
###264 the way and then it's like I'm clear to just go forward and
###269 jump down the thing.
###271 
###278 MICHAEL MAHER: I know in executing tricks and try like
###281 repeating them over and over there's a certain amount of
###283 repetition that's even necessary
###285 to be good at skating.
###287 I don't think anyone could make an assessment based on
###289 watching someone's, say, pre-trick ritual or behavior,
###295 whether they have a disorder or not.
###297 Oh sure, it's interesting because I grew up skating in a
###300 half-pipe in a friend's backyard and stuff like that
###303 and even the way you hold the board or start something or
###306 kick the board up like what we're talking about, get's
###309 associated with pulling off a trick right.
###311 I think they may even sort of cue motor systems to sort of
###315 be on target and paying attention to things that we're
###319 not so aware of.
###321 It may actually fine-tune our ability to pull off some
###324 difficult tricks or difficult maneuvers.
###329 KEVIN "SPANKY" LONG: I've had this theory that with
###331 skateboarding, with the madness, it's so hard to clear
###337 your mind when you're about to try a trick and if you're
###340 focusing on little stupid things like tapping or walking
###344 up the stairs a certain way, it kind of clears your mind.
###348 And you're like, OK, I did that right.
###350 I got it.
###353 ANDREW REYNOLDS: I mean, it's like I know people where OCD
###355 has came and pretty much fucked up their whole life and
###359 they can't do anything.
###360 They can but they need meds and it's all fucked up.
###365 And I realized it at one point, I have this and I do it
###369 and I know I do it.
###370 And I just thought to myself, well, it's worked this long I
###374 might as well keep doing it.
###375 PATRICK O'DELL: Yeah.
###376 ANDREW REYNOLDS: I can't stop it.
###378 
###381 MALE SPEAKER: Fuck!
###383 He fucked it up!
###384 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
###388 ANDREW REYNOLDS: Thank you, man.
###389 MALE SPEAKER: It's crazy.
###390 That was awesome.
###392 
###394 PATRICK O'DELL: Andrew, can I film your back one more time?
###396 
###401 Did you have madness that time?
###402 ANDREW REYNOLDS: You saw it.
###404 It was a lot of variations, though.
###406 PATRICK O'DELL: Yeah.
###408 ANDREW REYNOLDS: Tail drop, tap three, tail drop, tap
###410 three, tail drop, tap three.
###412 PATRICK O'DELL: Yeah.
###413 ANDREW REYNOLDS: It works though.
###414 PATRICK O'DELL: Hell yeah!
###415 ANDREW REYNOLDS: I have no complaints about it because I
###417 got my trick.
###418 PATRICK O'DELL: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
###419 BRYAN HERMAN: You see what it does if you tap
###420 the wall three times?
###421 He gets a chance to backstep at Wallenberg.
###424 Like that.
###425 
###429 ANDREW REYNOLDS: There's a 19 in Victorville that I really
###430 want to do.
###431 MALE SPEAKER: It's like that.
###432 BEAGLE: He's not even happy.
###433 He's not even happy.
###435 Monumental.
###437 JAKE PHELPS: He's like a Spiderman.
###439 His legs.
###441 All in the legs until he can't get up.
###442 He'll be doing it forever.
###443 He's better than all the whole fucking team.
###445 So you can park that and put that in your
###447 pipe and smoke it.
###447 All you little fags on the team, you
###449 can think about that.
###450 Who's the boss?
###451 The boss.
###451 Who's driving the van?
###452 The boss.
###453 Who's frontside flicking the big shit?
###454 The boss.
###455 To the rest of you guys, who cares.
###458 PATRICK O'DELL: What about Terry Kennedy?
###460 JAKE PHELPS: Who?
###460 PATRICK O'DELL: Terry.
###461 JAKE PHELPS: I don't know him.
###463 PATRICK O'DELL: How would you describe Jason Dill?
###465 JAKE PHELPS: Jesse's a great Brit skater.
###467 PATRICK O'DELL: How about Jason Dill?
###468 JAKE PHELPS: I don't know him.
###470 PATRICK O'DELL: What about Braydon Szafranski?
###472 JAKE PHELPS: Bust or Bail, that's what I call it.
###474 PATRICK O'DELL: Yeah.
###475
