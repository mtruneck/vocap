###0 today they were voting on background checks on the government robo has
###4 already incredibly watered down is not universal background checks
###8 there was johnnie loopholes in it
###10 and uh... then they want to add more loopholes
###13 now normal isn't having that passes actually
###16 bless your heart snow a lot of you out there were saying oh aging sebi adrian b
###20 he got this right he said that
###23 uh... gun control laws in the past
###25 well to be fair that's only half true
###28 uh... i fought the assault-weapons ban was going to pass of course is that he
###31 got crotch
###32 on a forty votes
###34 freer tho busted even have a filibuster
###36 and then uh...
###37 uh... high-capacity magzine that i said that was in the past
###41 net income goes either
###42 i got about forty six votes that also didn't get a majority soda all i was
###47 sure right about that stuff
###48 but i actually thought and i was i even of at some point i guess i think the
###52 background checks
###53 would be a fig leaf
###55 that they would say all right here you go get some background checks nine new
###58 much anyway
###59 well you know we kill the relevant portions the spell
###62 and that it would be you know obama moment it with a mission accomplished up
###65 their and that's a historic gun control legislation
###69 and particularly i fought back
###72 because bloomberg came to a twelve million dollars
###74 now twelve million dollars makes a lot of nevers and politics is pressuring you
###78 run ads against
###79 certain politicians apparently they haven't gotten that memo yet
###83 they definitely got that are a mammal
###85 because then or is this thing out money for decades
###89 now things might turn around a couple years i'll tell you i am i turn around
###92 in my body and a couple years two things that happen
###96 those bloomberg ads are gonna run and then the politicians are gonna start to
###100 feel the pain of that
###101 and it's already become immediate to them
###103 animator dot all man all i didn't know you have that much money
###107 whether there are a had more money okay my battles which my book
###111 the same thing that's going to happen is
###113 base root out today
###114 so uh... the main
###116 background check by board of drums up compromise obviously didn't pass right
###122 why is that a screw-up
###124 because you're supposed to put a fig leaf on a this is how washington
###127 normally works
###128 and say we solve it and move on
###132 but you didn't do that so what happened was anger
###136 live so they're trying to cut the same time anything into it
###140 hang on this
###141 it's the n_r_a_ overplaying their hand
###143 the bill was already incredibly weak
###146 you should have just take it
###148 instead you jump the shark
###151 there's signifi enter in the country now look
###154 it stretches out
###155 across everyone but it started at this moment when buying city and of course as
###161 the head of the senate businesses role but he does time to time as the vice
###164 president
###165 uh... ceremony only
###167 uh... window votes were announcers what up
###172 yours and
###177 the world
###179 on his vote the yeas are fifty four
###181 the nature of forty-six under the previous order requiring sixty votes

###224 so even though they have plenty of all it's a passenger or any
###226 it got killed anyway that's when
###229 uh... two women in vertigo started
###231 uh... sings share
###232 aim shez
###233 who are they want a lead researcher may show shea
###236 which is a person
###238 who's stopping jhrlaw funner

###254 i saw on my own eyes the war does he have a more bullets he had killed more
###257 people he killed she knows she's the one at the concert magazine away
###261 in fact i wanted or course right now
###263 she said
###264 looked you don't have established starters hussein issue should be ashamed
###268 from the rafters right
###270 there of course escort her out of the chamber
###273 and in the capital poisonous for out of the building when reporters definite
###277 and what what the police do and they talked her here's what she says
###281 when i was told
###282 it was done
###284 i decided that i could not stay
###286 still any longer
###287 that they needed to be ashamed of themselves
###290 they have no souls
###292 they have no compassion
###293 for the experiences that people have lived through
###295 having a child or loved one murdered by a gun
###299 issue and i must say
###300 there are nim barris man to our country
###304 as giving that's harsh way to get a lotta gabby giffords
###307 she's of course a congresswoman was shot mad
###310 and she did not pull back either she put out a statement say moments ago the u_s_
###314 senate decided to do the unthinkable about gun violence
###318 nothing
###319 at all
###320 he went on to say
###322 over two years ago
###324 when i was shot point-blank in their head
###327 the u_s_ senate shows and do nothing
###330 four months ago twenty first graders lost their lives
###333 and a brutal attack on their school
###335 and the u_s_ senate shows to do nothing
###339 it's clear to me that members of the u_s_ senate
###341 refused to change the laws
###343 to reduce gun violence then we need to change
###346 the members of the u_s_ senate
###348 damn straight
###349 but that's my khana language
###351 you either
###352 get a lot of ninety one percent of the country
###355 when you get the hell out of the this place
###357 that this is what we need to spend money time energy resources
###361 to make sure but the people who voted against this bill that they'd leave
###366 politically
###368 politically
###369 we go to get them
###370 well that pitchfork
###372 and if it takes bloomberg's miami you grab bloomberg's money
###376 everything's getting different safe
###377 shame on you i got shot on the head
###380 out your fellow congresswoman
###382 i got shot padding you didn't know anything about it
###385 well then that's what we know s
###387 this isn't coming for your guns
###389 this is the simplest
###391 piece of legislation
###393 hate week you can just buy a gun without doing a background check
###397 we need to know what your credibility or terrorist
###399 but there are a so strong it doesn't matter you can buy a gun even if you're
###403 on the terrorist watchlist did you know that
###406 that's why it because it ad already has this
###409 congress lock stock and barrel they got locked up
###413 and they shot it today
###416 ashamed
###417 at the very least they should be ashamed
###422 so now were nowhere
###424 nowhere we've gotten awfully
###428 but that andrew will rise and now let me tell you the third reason
###432 why they will eventually lose on this
###435 because unfortunately there will be another tragedy
###439 solely a matter of time
###441 the mass shootings keep on coming in
###444 i wish that hell they didn't
###446 but they do
###448 you think there won't be another
###450 horrible tragic nationally
###452 and you think it won't happen relatively soon
###455 you they would have to wait a couple of years i wish we waited forever and never
###458 happen again
###460 but it's gonna happen again and again that and again
###464 and then the next time
###466 you wanna cnr
###467 is going to be real anger
###470 because you know why
###472 you didn't do the one thing you're supposed to do most of all
###475 you're supposed to protect the citizens
###478 protecting the citizens isn't
###480 going in and being a country like iraq had been the packers
###483 starting senseless war so defense contractors
###486 an auto companies gain get paid in get rich
###489 protecting our sentences
###491 is making sure that what young kids
###493 don't get shot and killed in a
###495 classes they went to
###497 it's pretty it
###500 something you're not only for becca gotten stable from getting shot of the
###503 head
###505 you know as all these people are saying uganda has had you know she
###509 but the answer is obvious
###511 of course they don't
###512 of course they don't all they care about is
###516 who signs my checks
###518 and if there are a signing my checks i don't give a damn who gets murdered
###522 that's what the boat was about today
