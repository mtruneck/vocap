CHARLES MOORE: Every reporter
changes the story.


3
0:0:20,48 --> 0:0:23,35
Just like every scientist
changes what he's observing,


4
0:0:23,35 --> 0:0:25,438
every reporter is changing
that story.

0:0:42,64 --> 0:0:43,954
MEREDITH DANLUCK: What
are we doing, Joe?


7
0:0:43,954 --> 0:0:47,576
JOE GOODMAN: Well, I'm ready
to put a plastic catcher in


8
0:0:47,576 --> 0:0:48,894
the water, a troll.


9
0:0:48,894 --> 0:0:49,388
MALE SPEAKER: Troll?


10
0:0:49,388 --> 0:0:51,364
JOE GOODMAN: So I'll
troll for plastic.

0:0:51,364 --> 0:1:4,208
[MUSIC PLAYING]


12
0:1:4,208 --> 0:1:7,666
CHARLES MOORE: What in
the hell is that?


13
0:1:7,666 --> 0:1:12,1
There's a misconception that the
worst kind of spill is the


14
0:1:12,1 --> 0:1:12,593
gooey, oily mess.


15
0:1:12,593 --> 0:1:13,8
THOMAS MORTON: Yeah.


16
0:1:13,8 --> 0:1:15,24
CHARLES MOORE: But it's really
these nice little bits of your


17
0:1:15,24 --> 0:1:16,776
plastic bottles that
are going to be


18
0:1:16,776 --> 0:1:21,18
around forever, basically.


19
0:1:21,18 --> 0:1:23,18
THOMAS MORTON: So we're just
on the outskirts of


20
0:1:23,18 --> 0:1:24,5
the gyre right now.


21
0:1:24,5 --> 0:1:25,71
I haven't really even gotten
into the thick of things.


22
0:1:25,71 --> 0:1:28,72
And already, in the last hour,
we've seen more fucking trash


23
0:1:28,72 --> 0:1:32,79
float by than we have in the
entire voyage up until now.


24
0:1:32,79 --> 0:1:36,69



25
0:1:36,69 --> 0:1:37,44
We're nowhere near land.


26
0:1:37,44 --> 0:1:39,52
We're nowhere near any
other fucking ships.


27
0:1:39,52 --> 0:1:43,36
And it's just flotsam
city out here.


28
0:1:43,36 --> 0:1:51,5
All fucking plastic too, all
gross, sun baked, plastic.


29
0:1:51,5 --> 0:1:52,745
It's absurd.


30
0:1:52,745 --> 0:1:55,87
FREDERICK VOM SAAL: Just this
one chemical, bisphenol A,


31
0:1:55,87 --> 0:1:59,79
that is used to make this hard,
clear plastic called


32
0:1:59,79 --> 0:2:5,85
polycarbonate, is produced at
over 7 billion pounds a year.


33
0:2:5,85 --> 0:2:8,44
And it's a non-recyclable
plastic.


34
0:2:8,44 --> 0:2:10,509
What's happening to it?


35
0:2:10,509 --> 0:2:13,17
It's being thrown away
into the environment.


36
0:2:13,17 --> 0:2:19,94
The evidence from Europe, Asia,
the United States, is


37
0:2:19,94 --> 0:2:23,14
that every person examined
has these


38
0:2:23,14 --> 0:2:25,19
chemicals in their bodies.


39
0:2:25,19 --> 0:2:28,74
There is actually a study in
Japan where women with


40
0:2:28,74 --> 0:2:32,46
elevated levels of bisphenol
A were the women who were


41
0:2:32,46 --> 0:2:35,56
repeatedly miscarrying,
never able to have


42
0:2:35,56 --> 0:2:37,89
a successful pregnancy.


43
0:2:37,89 --> 0:2:42,35
When you go out into the ocean
and you see that the ocean is


44
0:2:42,35 --> 0:2:47,15
full of these plastic products,
where in the world


45
0:2:47,15 --> 0:2:49,7
is there not exposure to them?


46
0:2:49,7 --> 0:3:9,46
[MUSIC PLAYING]


47
0:3:9,46 --> 0:3:10,32
THOMAS MORTON: Tell me when.


48
0:3:10,32 --> 0:3:10,78
Ready?


49
0:3:10,78 --> 0:3:12,22
JAKE BURGHART: All right,
whenever you're ready.


50
0:3:12,22 --> 0:3:13,48
THOMAS MORTON: OK,
you rolling?


51
0:3:13,48 --> 0:3:14,512
JAKE BURGHART: Yep.


52
0:3:14,512 --> 0:3:15,49
THOMAS MORTON: Hi.


53
0:3:15,49 --> 0:3:16,89
I'm Thomas Morton.


54
0:3:16,89 --> 0:3:19,42
We're here in Long Beach,
California, on our way to meet


55
0:3:19,42 --> 0:3:22,93
Charles Moore, who's the captain
of the oceanographic


56
0:3:22,93 --> 0:3:25,265
research vessel, Alguita.


57
0:3:25,265 --> 0:3:27,51
For a number of years, we've
been reading these articles


58
0:3:27,51 --> 0:3:30,28
about this just huge section
of the ocean that's


59
0:3:30,28 --> 0:3:32,89
essentially a floating
landfill.


60
0:3:32,89 --> 0:3:37,35
10 years ago, on a sailing
trip back from Australia,


61
0:3:37,35 --> 0:3:41,26
Captain Moore took a detour into
a section of the North


62
0:3:41,26 --> 0:3:44,52
Pacific called the North Pacific
Gyre, which is kind of


63
0:3:44,52 --> 0:3:47,54
a swirling vortex of currents.


64
0:3:47,54 --> 0:3:50,52
That area has historically acted
as a collecting point


65
0:3:50,52 --> 0:3:51,58
for all the debris.


66
0:3:51,58 --> 0:3:55,19
And it's sometimes referred to
as the Eastern Garbage Patch.


67
0:3:55,19 --> 0:4:0,1
Now, with the advent of
plastics, it's just become one


68
0:4:0,1 --> 0:4:3,0
large, continuous dump.


69
0:4:3,0 --> 0:4:6,23
When Captain Moore found it, it
was just plastic bags and


70
0:4:6,23 --> 0:4:10,7
bottles and consumer products
as far as the eye can see.


71
0:4:10,7 --> 0:4:13,23
Some places have estimated
it as the size of Texas.


72
0:4:13,23 --> 0:4:15,69
There's a lot of what sounds
like hyperbole.


73
0:4:15,69 --> 0:4:16,76
And some people have
written it off


74
0:4:16,76 --> 0:4:18,47
totally as an urban myth.


75
0:4:18,47 --> 0:4:22,2
So we're going to go out with
Captain Moore on his boat to


76
0:4:22,2 --> 0:4:24,75
survey the damage out there.


77
0:4:24,75 --> 0:4:26,9
I've never been on a boat.


78
0:4:26,9 --> 0:4:31,13
And I've been kind of boning
up on my knots and swimming


79
0:4:31,13 --> 0:4:32,68
lessons and all.


80
0:4:32,68 --> 0:4:33,59
It's a three-week trip.


81
0:4:33,59 --> 0:4:37,33
A week to get out there, a week
of taking samples and


82
0:4:37,33 --> 0:4:40,44
hanging out with all the trash,
and a week to get back.


83
0:4:40,44 --> 0:4:43,48
We are going to act as crew.


84
0:4:43,48 --> 0:4:46,15
That's Jake, our camera guy.


85
0:4:46,15 --> 0:4:48,9
Meredith, our producer.


86
0:4:48,9 --> 0:4:53,23
We are 1/2 of the crew of the
ORV Alguita on our way to


87
0:4:53,23 --> 0:4:53,42
"Garbage


88
0:4:53,42 --> 0:4:56,686
Island." [CAR HORN]


89

MEREDITH DANLUCK:
Captain Moore?


90
0:5:0,144 --> 0:5:1,132
THOMAS MORTON: Hi.


91
0:5:1,132 --> 0:5:1,63
I'm Thomas.


92
0:5:1,63 --> 0:5:2,442
CHARLES MOORE: Nice to
meet you, Thomas.


93
0:5:2,442 --> 0:5:3,426
THOMAS MORTON: Good
to meet you.


94
0:5:3,426 --> 0:5:4,41
CHARLES MOORE: Good
to have you.


95
0:5:4,41 --> 0:5:4,983
Come on aboard.


96
0:5:4,983 --> 0:5:5,42
Come on aboard.


97
0:5:5,42 --> 0:5:6,4
THOMAS MORTON: Thank you.


98
0:5:6,4 --> 0:5:8,85
CHARLES MOORE: We've got some
people for you to meet here.


99
0:5:8,85 --> 0:5:10,74
FEMALE SPEAKER: Great.


100
0:5:10,74 --> 0:5:10,81
Welcome.


101
0:5:10,81 --> 0:5:11,79
THOMAS MORTON: Hello.


102
0:5:11,79 --> 0:5:12,77
FEMALE SPEAKER: Come on in.


103
0:5:12,77 --> 0:5:15,71
Welcome aboard.


104
0:5:15,71 --> 0:5:18,86
CHARLES MOORE: We do have
a freezer on this side.


105
0:5:18,86 --> 0:5:22,702
And we can put a couple gallons
of ice cream in there.


106
0:5:22,702 --> 0:5:24,58
MEREDITH DANLUCK: Ice cream
seems to be a high


107
0:5:24,58 --> 0:5:25,326
priority for you.


108
0:5:25,326 --> 0:5:28,83
CHARLES MOORE: Well, it's
like that's a treat


109
0:5:28,83 --> 0:5:29,87
because it's a dry boat.


110
0:5:29,87 --> 0:5:33,67
I usually give it one day in the
jar, because it's so calm


111
0:5:33,67 --> 0:5:36,42
and we've been working so hard
for so long, where we just put


112
0:5:36,42 --> 0:5:37,725
out the sea anchor and stop.


113
0:5:37,725 --> 0:5:39,9
And if you want to get
pissed, go ahead.


114
0:5:39,9 --> 0:5:41,385
[LAUGHTER]


115
0:5:41,385 --> 0:5:44,58
CHARLES MOORE: But mostly, when
you're on watch and we're


116
0:5:44,58 --> 0:5:46,32
working, it's a dry boat.


117
0:5:46,32 --> 0:5:46,72
THOMAS MORTON: Yeah.


118
0:5:46,72 --> 0:5:50,16
CHARLES MOORE: That's
just the way it is.


119
0:5:50,16 --> 0:5:52,92
I know that you don't have
much experience.


120
0:5:52,92 --> 0:5:54,83
But do you know whether or
not you get sea sick?


121
0:5:54,83 --> 0:5:56,78
THOMAS MORTON: I have
in the past.


122
0:5:56,78 --> 0:5:57,7
CHARLES MOORE: OK, so
you're going to


123
0:5:57,7 --> 0:5:59,2
probably want the patch.


124
0:5:59,2 --> 0:5:59,503
THOMAS MORTON: I might.


125
0:5:59,503 --> 0:6:0,61
CHARLES MOORE: At least
to get started.


126
0:6:0,61 --> 0:6:4,9
THOMAS MORTON: I'm about to get
my scopolamine patch to


127
0:6:4,9 --> 0:6:8,43
help keep down the sea
sickness, hopefully.


128
0:6:8,43 --> 0:6:13,4
This is the same stuff that
Colombian gangsters use to


129
0:6:13,4 --> 0:6:14,11
knock people out.


130
0:6:14,11 --> 0:6:15,47
FEMALE SPEAKER: The one thing
you want to be careful of is,


131
0:6:15,47 --> 0:6:19,9
if you touch it, don't
touch your eyes.


132
0:6:19,9 --> 0:6:21,18
THOMAS MORTON: OK.


133
0:6:21,18 --> 0:6:22,163
I'm just going to--


134
0:6:22,163 --> 0:6:22,506
[LAUGHTER]


135
0:6:22,506 --> 0:6:24,37
THOMAS MORTON: I'm not going
to try to imagine


136
0:6:24,37 --> 0:6:25,1
what that would do.


137
0:6:25,1 --> 0:6:25,68
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.


138
0:6:25,68 --> 0:6:26,93
THOMAS MORTON: I'm not
going to do it.


139
0:6:26,93 --> 0:6:56,233



140
0:6:56,233 --> 0:6:59,12
JAKE BURGHART: We haven't
really done anything.


141
0:6:59,12 --> 0:7:0,36
We loaded up the boat.


142
0:7:0,36 --> 0:7:3,19
And since we're going to be at
sea for three weeks and then


143
0:7:3,19 --> 0:7:6,792
this boat's going to be in
Hawaii for a ways of time and


144
0:7:6,792 --> 0:7:8,85
then coming back, so
they're just making


145
0:7:8,85 --> 0:7:10,224
everything super tight.


146
0:7:10,224 --> 0:7:13,598



147
0:7:13,598 --> 0:7:16,56
MEREDITH DANLUCK: Do you want
to introduce yourself?


148
0:7:16,56 --> 0:7:19,492
JOE GOODMAN: The last voyage,
nobody survived.


149
0:7:19,492 --> 0:7:19,91
Hi.


150
0:7:19,91 --> 0:7:20,876
My name is Joe Goodman.


151
0:7:20,876 --> 0:7:22,48
MEREDITH DANLUCK: What
do you do, Joe?


152
0:7:22,48 --> 0:7:26,592
JOE GOODMAN: I'm a physician
in Fresno, California.


153
0:7:26,592 --> 0:7:29,7
I work with crazy people.


154
0:7:29,7 --> 0:7:31,66
MEREDITH DANLUCK: [LAUGHS]


155
0:7:31,66 --> 0:7:33,473
JOE GOODMAN: I don't know if
you know Captain Moore, but


156
0:7:33,473 --> 0:7:35,38
the guy is an extremely
good cook.


157
0:7:35,38 --> 0:7:36,55
THOMAS MORTON: That's
what we've read.


158
0:7:36,55 --> 0:7:38,716
JOE GOODMAN: So don't hesitate
saying, hey, by the way-- this


159
0:7:38,716 --> 0:7:40,34
is on film too.


160
0:7:40,34 --> 0:7:40,92
I love the man.


161
0:7:40,92 --> 0:7:41,26
I love him.


162
0:7:41,26 --> 0:7:41,94
THOMAS MORTON: It seems
it, so far.


163
0:7:41,94 --> 0:7:45,67
JOE GOODMAN: He also will keep a
little distant to all of us.


164
0:7:45,67 --> 0:7:46,8
I mean, he'll bark at me too.


165
0:7:46,8 --> 0:7:48,91
If I'm not moving fast enough,
he's going to say something.


166
0:7:48,91 --> 0:7:49,175
THOMAS MORTON: Yeah.


167
0:7:49,175 --> 0:7:51,32
JOE GOODMAN: So don't
take offense to it.


168
0:7:51,32 --> 0:7:53,82
Safety is number one for
hitting on his boat.


169
0:7:53,82 --> 0:7:56,28
Everyone that comes back,
healthy, happy and enjoyable.


170
0:7:56,28 --> 0:7:58,29
And nobody has any problems.


171
0:7:58,29 --> 0:8:2,1
And then you cross over,
and then come through.


172
0:8:2,1 --> 0:8:7,83
MEREDITH DANLUCK: We're
preparing to leave, to leave


173
0:8:7,83 --> 0:8:9,89
and not see land for
three weeks.


174
0:8:9,89 --> 0:8:12,832
I trust the captain.


175
0:8:12,832 --> 0:8:16,598
He knows what he's
doing, right?


176
0:8:16,598 --> 0:8:17,848
This smells like cat piss.


177
0:8:17,848 --> 0:8:23,556



178
0:8:23,556 --> 0:8:57,392
LORENA M. RIOS MENDOZA:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]


179
0:8:57,392 --> 0:9:2,3
CHARLES MOORE: And now
here's the sea grass


180
0:9:2,3 --> 0:9:3,5
and all this plastic.


181
0:9:3,5 --> 0:9:7,66
This is a pre-production
plastic pellet here.


182
0:9:7,66 --> 0:9:12,28
These pellets are the virgin
material that have never been


183
0:9:12,28 --> 0:9:13,66
through the hands
of a consumer.


184
0:9:13,66 --> 0:9:18,2
They're just what the factory
uses to make plastic objects


185
0:9:18,2 --> 0:9:21,85
out of, whether it's a plastic
bag or a coffee cup.


186
0:9:21,85 --> 0:9:26,47
They get here by being lost in
the rail yards and the truck


187
0:9:26,47 --> 0:9:28,59
delivery docks.


188
0:9:28,59 --> 0:9:32,595
It's a symbol of the whole
plastic production chain, how


189
0:9:32,595 --> 0:9:35,73
it pollutes from the very
beginning, when it's just in


190
0:9:35,73 --> 0:9:38,0
this pellet form, up to
these bottle caps.


191
0:9:38,0 --> 0:9:42,6
We may get up to, say, 50% of
some water bottles recycled.


192
0:9:42,6 --> 0:9:44,965
But none of the caps are
getting recycled at the


193
0:9:44,965 --> 0:9:46,215
present time.


194
0:9:46,215 --> 0:9:51,1



195
0:9:51,1 --> 0:9:53,6
She's on the phone.


196
0:9:53,6 --> 0:9:55,8
Soon there will be no phone.


197
0:9:55,8 --> 0:9:58,79
It will be all work
and no play.


198
0:9:58,79 --> 0:10:0,542
MEREDITH DANLUCK: [LAUGHTER]


199
0:10:0,542 --> 0:10:3,4
THOMAS MORTON: I think, from
first impressions, we're going


200
0:10:3,4 --> 0:10:6,54
to have kind of a family cruise
vibe on this trip.


201
0:10:6,54 --> 0:10:10,8
Captain Moore is, obviously,
the no-nonsense dad.


202
0:10:10,8 --> 0:10:12,52
He sort of reminds me
of the dad from


203
0:10:12,52 --> 0:10:15,47
Freaks and Geeks a little.


204
0:10:15,47 --> 0:10:17,28
Joe's the wacky uncle.


205
0:10:17,28 --> 0:10:21,38
Lorena's the Mexican
scientist aunt.


206
0:10:21,38 --> 0:10:25,51
And I guess we're the
slightly grown kids.


207
0:10:25,51 --> 0:10:27,94
THOMAS MORTON: You all right?


208
0:10:27,94 --> 0:10:28,82
Did you just clock yourself?


209
0:10:28,82 --> 0:10:29,4
JAKE BURGHART: Yeah.


210
0:10:29,4 --> 0:10:29,8
THOMAS MORTON: Nice.


211
0:10:29,8 --> 0:10:32,714
CHARLES MOORE: OK, here we go!


212
0:10:32,714 --> 0:10:36,9
Gwen, we got Gwen on
the stern line.


213
0:10:36,9 --> 0:10:38,47
We've got Parker on the bow.


214
0:10:38,47 --> 0:10:39,42
[APPLAUSE]

0:10:39,42 --> 0:10:41,795

a great trip!


217
0:10:43,22 --> 0:10:45,12
FEMALE SPEAKER: Have
a nice journey!


218
0:10:45,12 --> 0:10:47,37
THOMAS MORTON: I don't know if
it's like California, or being


219
0:10:47,37 --> 0:10:48,87
in a marina.


220
0:10:48,87 --> 0:10:50,96
It's really hard to distinguish
between other


221
0:10:50,96 --> 0:10:56,55
people that are being friendly
or dickheads or are just so


222
0:10:56,55 --> 0:10:58,76
sun-basted, their
brains are done.


223
0:10:58,76 --> 0:11:5,606



224
0:11:5,606 --> 0:11:9,34
You know, it's funny if you
consider that there are places


225
0:11:9,34 --> 0:11:12,2
in the world that are
seven days away.


226
0:11:12,2 --> 0:11:14,63



227
0:11:14,63 --> 0:11:17,93
Like flying to Hawaii from LA
or whatever takes, what?


228
0:11:17,93 --> 0:11:18,265
Like eight hours?


229
0:11:18,265 --> 0:11:21,9
Eight or nine?


230
0:11:21,9 --> 0:11:24,53
And yet this is going to
be seven days away.


231
0:11:24,53 --> 0:11:45,3
[MUSIC PLAYING]


232
0:11:45,3 --> 0:11:46,4
JOE GOODMAN: Here he is.


233
0:11:46,4 --> 0:11:48,93
He's coming up right here.


234
0:11:48,93 --> 0:11:49,905
THOMAS MORTON: There we go.


235
0:11:49,905 --> 0:11:50,9
Oh, this might be
the final one.


236
0:11:50,9 --> 0:11:51,4
Look.


237
0:11:51,4 --> 0:11:52,39
Look.


238
0:11:52,39 --> 0:11:54,88
JOE GOODMAN: I tell you, if he
circles around, I'm putting my


239
0:11:54,88 --> 0:11:55,61
wet suit on.


240
0:11:55,61 --> 0:11:56,6
[LAUGHTER]


241
0:11:56,6 --> 0:11:56,96
JOE GOODMAN: Yeah.


242
0:11:56,96 --> 0:11:58,75
So I've swam with the Orcas.


243
0:11:58,75 --> 0:11:59,68
Orcas aren't afraid of me.


244
0:11:59,68 --> 0:12:1,575
I'm not afraid of them.


245
0:12:1,575 --> 0:12:3,38
They can take me, if they
want to, today.


246
0:12:3,38 --> 0:12:6,88



247
0:12:6,88 --> 0:12:8,381
THOMAS MORTON: It's
just water now.


248
0:12:8,381 --> 0:12:10,686
MEREDITH DANLUCK: There's
not even any boats.


249
0:12:10,686 --> 0:12:11,61
THOMAS MORTON: Nope.


250
0:12:11,61 --> 0:12:15,285
Nothing on the radar,
on the radio.


251
0:12:15,285 --> 0:12:17,61
Just us.


252
0:12:17,61 --> 0:12:19,613
MEREDITH DANLUCK: I got a little
twinge of anxiety last


253
0:12:19,613 --> 0:12:22,8
night where I was
like, holy fuck.


254
0:12:22,8 --> 0:12:25,44
We are on a boat in the
middle of the ocean.


255
0:12:25,44 --> 0:12:26,3
JOE GOODMAN: We're not even
close to the middle yet.


256
0:12:26,3 --> 0:12:27,15
MEREDITH DANLUCK: Yeah.


257
0:12:27,15 --> 0:12:29,23
JOE GOODMAN: I can
still see land.


258
0:12:29,23 --> 0:12:31,12
THOMAS MORTON: What made
you want to come?


259
0:12:31,12 --> 0:12:32,54
JOE GOODMAN: First I've
always wanted to be


260
0:12:32,54 --> 0:12:33,38
in the North Pacific.


261
0:12:33,38 --> 0:12:35,24
I've never sailed this
area before.


262
0:12:35,24 --> 0:12:38,64
Also, I wanted to know about the
plastic garbage problem.


263
0:12:38,64 --> 0:12:40,54
There's so much that
individuals, they get


264
0:12:40,54 --> 0:12:43,3
inundated, inundated,
inundated.


265
0:12:43,3 --> 0:12:45,8
And yet something really
significant, like The Gyre,


266
0:12:45,8 --> 0:12:47,11
nobody knows about it.


267
0:12:47,11 --> 0:12:49,52
I mean, if we didn't have this
boat and some other people,


268
0:12:49,52 --> 0:12:50,8
who would ever tell
us about it?


269
0:12:50,8 --> 0:12:51,63
It's the middle of nowhere.


270
0:12:51,63 --> 0:12:53,66
Why would it affect us?


271
0:12:53,66 --> 0:12:54,45
It's the middle of nowhere.


272
0:12:54,45 --> 0:12:56,16
We don't see it.


273
0:12:56,16 --> 0:12:58,28
And if you don't see it,
it doesn't exist.


274
0:12:58,28 --> 0:13:1,304
[MUSIC PLAYING]


275
0:13:1,304 --> 0:13:3,14
CHARLES MOORE: Where can
you really see a


276
0:13:3,14 --> 0:13:6,6
huge expanse of nothing?


277
0:13:6,6 --> 0:13:8,402
What's the biggest thing most
people ever see that's really


278
0:13:8,402 --> 0:13:10,6
open and unencumbered?


279
0:13:10,6 --> 0:13:13,64
Like a desert scene?


280
0:13:13,64 --> 0:13:15,43
But still, it's very finite,
compared to the ocean.


281
0:13:15,43 --> 0:13:15,818
MEREDITH DANLUCK: How
much garbage do you


282
0:13:15,818 --> 0:13:17,86
think is in the ocean?


283
0:13:17,86 --> 0:13:21,312
CHARLES MOORE: I think there's
100 million tons minimum.


284
0:13:21,312 --> 0:13:23,96
100 million tons minimum.


285
0:13:23,96 --> 0:13:25,8
We're all guilty.


286
0:13:25,8 --> 0:13:27,5
There's no guiltless
parties here.


287
0:13:27,5 --> 0:13:39,815



288
0:13:39,815 --> 0:13:41,306
MEREDITH DANLUCK: Ooh.


289
0:13:41,306 --> 0:13:41,803
Wow.


290
0:13:41,803 --> 0:13:42,672
MALE SPEAKER: What'd you get?


291
0:13:42,672 --> 0:13:43,922
THOMAS MORTON: Whoa.


292
0:13:43,922 --> 0:13:46,276



293
0:13:46,276 --> 0:13:50,66
I busted out the ship's jelly
guide and managed to hit the


294
0:13:50,66 --> 0:13:51,63
right page.


295
0:13:51,63 --> 0:13:52,17
Jesus Christ.


296
0:13:52,17 --> 0:13:55,88
OK, so I went to the glossary to
look up manubrium, because


297
0:13:55,88 --> 0:13:57,86
I was a little unclear
on what that was.


298
0:13:57,86 --> 0:14:2,14
And thankfully, it lays
it straight for me.


299
0:14:2,14 --> 0:14:4,63
"The manubrium is a variously
shaped pendant,


300
0:14:4,63 --> 0:14:8,52
subumbrellular, gastrovascular
cavity in medusa bearing a


301
0:14:8,52 --> 0:14:10,198
terminal mouth."
[MAKES SPITTING NOISE]


302
0:14:10,198 --> 0:14:13,691
Of course.


303
0:14:13,691 --> 0:14:18,182
MEREDITH DANLUCK: It really is
amazing how similar plastic


304
0:14:18,182 --> 0:14:21,47
looks to the jellies.


305
0:14:21,47 --> 0:14:24,75
I swam up to it thinking
it was jelly.


306
0:14:24,75 --> 0:14:26,0
It's crazy.

LORENA M. RIOS MENDOZA:


309
0:14:52,69 --> 0:14:54,84
CHARLES MOORE: Every part
needs to have a


310
0:14:54,84 --> 0:14:57,78
well-understood by the
general public end.


311
0:14:57,78 --> 0:15:0,214
You can't just say it's the
consumer's fault, right?


312
0:15:0,214 --> 0:15:1,85
You've got to have a
place for it to go.


313
0:15:1,85 --> 0:15:3,202
Right now, plastic
has no end game.


314
0:15:3,202 --> 0:15:4,198
You're done with it?


315
0:15:4,198 --> 0:15:5,692
Well, which bucket
do I throw it in?


316
0:15:5,692 --> 0:15:7,684
You know, there's no end game.


317
0:15:7,684 --> 0:15:12,636



318
0:15:12,636 --> 0:15:14,53
MEREDITH DANLUCK: I've
done it before.


319
0:15:14,53 --> 0:15:17,946
I don't know what kind
of status that is.


320
0:15:17,946 --> 0:15:20,27
THOMAS MORTON: Isn't it a little
ironic that, on a trip


321
0:15:20,27 --> 0:15:24,14
out to see the damage plastic's
doing to the ocean,


322
0:15:24,14 --> 0:15:26,95
almost all the food that we need
for the trip has to be


323
0:15:26,95 --> 0:15:27,97
kept in plastic?


324
0:15:27,97 --> 0:15:31,2
CHARLES MOORE: I'm quite sure
all of us during this trip


325
0:15:31,2 --> 0:15:36,11
have contributed plastic to the
ocean, not wantonly, but


326
0:15:36,11 --> 0:15:36,88
helplessly.


327
0:15:36,88 --> 0:15:39,65
With all the plastic we have,
we can't help it.


328
0:15:39,65 --> 0:15:42,35
This idea that we're going to
have all these pristine


329
0:15:42,35 --> 0:15:43,972
products in plastic one after
the other, and open, open,


330
0:15:43,972 --> 0:15:48,37
open, open, all day long, it's
like Christmas every day,


331
0:15:48,37 --> 0:15:49,13
you're being fooled.


332
0:15:49,13 --> 0:15:50,802
What about an orange?


333
0:15:50,802 --> 0:15:51,64
That has its own wrapper.


334
0:15:51,64 --> 0:15:53,4
What about a head of lettuce?


335
0:15:53,4 --> 0:15:55,405
Romaine lettuce, you just pick
off the outer leaves.


336
0:15:55,405 --> 0:15:56,56
You don't need a wrapper.


337
0:15:56,56 --> 0:15:59,26
Now there's a million things
that don't need this bullshit.

MEREDITH DANLUCK:
What is that?


339
0:16:2,17 --> 0:16:5,85

sort of pod fruit?

What is it?


341
0:16:6,1 --> 0:16:8,25
CHARLES MOORE: Banana flower.

remember what day it is when


350
0:16:36,75 --> 0:16:39,45
all you're doing is
sitting on a boat.


351
0:16:39,45 --> 0:16:42,56
We've been having shit luck
with sailing wind.


352
0:16:42,56 --> 0:16:45,14
So we've been running the
motors the whole time.


353
0:16:45,14 --> 0:16:47,6
And now we need to refuel.


354
0:16:47,6 --> 0:16:49,92
Have to run hoses down into the
tanks from those little


355
0:16:49,92 --> 0:16:51,72
nozzles on top.


356
0:16:51,72 --> 0:16:53,97
I guess it's kind of ironic
that we're here on this


357
0:16:53,97 --> 0:16:55,55
environmental tour
of the place.


358
0:16:55,55 --> 0:16:57,91
Nature won't even give us the
winds we need not to pollute


359
0:16:57,91 --> 0:16:59,42
her with diesel fumes.


360
0:16:59,42 --> 0:17:1,94
CHARLES MOORE: Can you imagine
this full of vegetable oil?


361
0:17:1,94 --> 0:17:2,94
THOMAS MORTON: So you're
planning on


362
0:17:2,94 --> 0:17:5,79
converting your engine.


363
0:17:5,79 --> 0:17:7,485
How soon do you think you're
going to be able to do that?


364
0:17:7,485 --> 0:17:10,329
CHARLES MOORE: As soon as I
can identify sources in


365
0:17:10,329 --> 0:17:11,77
foreign ports where
I'll be traveling.


366
0:17:11,77 --> 0:17:13,83
THOMAS MORTON: Ah!

five inches, mate.

THOMAS MORTON: So we just
stopped and Lorena's going to


373
0:17:45,64 --> 0:17:48,6
take her first samples.


374
0:17:48,6 --> 0:17:50,75
We're just going to see, I
think, what the plastic


375
0:17:50,75 --> 0:17:52,704
content in this water is,
and see if we can


376
0:17:52,704 --> 0:17:54,97
catch a couple of pieces.


377
0:17:54,97 --> 0:17:56,67
It's literally what
you'd expect.


378
0:17:56,67 --> 0:18:0,78
It's like beakers and funnels,
some sort of weird handheld


379
0:18:0,78 --> 0:18:2,63
microscope, it looks like.

LORENA M. RIOS MENDOZA: Yes.

0:18:13,9 --> 0:18:39,181
LORENA M. RIOS MENDOZA:


389
0:18:39,181 --> 0:18:41,54
THOMAS MORTON: Lorena was
explaining to me earlier a


390
0:18:41,54 --> 0:18:46,5
little bit of her equipment,
some sort of solution that's


391
0:18:46,5 --> 0:18:49,92
going to somehow indicate the
presence of plastic particles,


392
0:18:49,92 --> 0:18:52,46
polymers, in the water, so
that you can get a rough


393
0:18:52,46 --> 0:18:56,54
estimate of what the exact
polymer count is.


394
0:18:56,54 --> 0:18:58,93
JOE GOODMAN: Wherever there's
little areas of collection,


395
0:18:58,93 --> 0:19:0,73
you see this stuff
filling them up.


396
0:19:0,73 --> 0:19:3,9
And historically, these places
were places where nutrients


397
0:19:3,9 --> 0:19:4,92
accumulated.


398
0:19:4,92 --> 0:19:7,57
And debris had nutrient value.


399
0:19:7,57 --> 0:19:9,18
It was biodegradable.


400
0:19:9,18 --> 0:19:13,4
Now we're covering up with a
suffocating layer of non-gas


401
0:19:13,4 --> 0:19:17,95
permeable plastic with toxics
attached to it.


402
0:19:17,95 --> 0:19:19,792
When you put your hand in here,
you can feel some of the


403
0:19:19,792 --> 0:19:21,3
hard objects, the plastics.


404
0:19:21,3 --> 0:19:22,55
It's kind of interesting.


405
0:19:22,55 --> 0:19:25,41
THOMAS MORTON: The difference
between organic trash and


406
0:19:25,41 --> 0:19:29,43
synthetics is whereas the
organic stuff biodegrades,


407
0:19:29,43 --> 0:19:32,32
plastics, they just break down
into individual polymers.


408
0:19:32,32 --> 0:19:34,37
So as small as they
keep getting, it's


409
0:19:34,37 --> 0:19:37,24
still the same plastic.


410
0:19:37,24 --> 0:19:41,58
It's every part of a Coke bottle
busted down into a


411
0:19:41,58 --> 0:19:43,5
little digestible morsel.


412
0:19:43,5 --> 0:19:47,235



413
0:19:47,235 --> 0:19:50,17
CHARLES MOORE: What we say is,
we sweat the small stuff.


414
0:19:50,17 --> 0:19:53,23
And what we're doing with Lorena
is trying to get down


415
0:19:53,23 --> 0:19:54,44
into what we can't see.


416
0:19:54,44 --> 0:19:57,42
No one's tried to find
microplastics in the main


417
0:19:57,42 --> 0:19:57,85
environment.


418
0:19:57,85 --> 0:20:0,1
What is it doing to
these jellyfish?


419
0:20:0,1 --> 0:20:2,98
When we pull up blobs of plastic
and globs of jelly all


420
0:20:2,98 --> 0:20:5,179
mixed together, what's
going on there?


421
0:20:5,179 --> 0:20:8,53



422
0:20:8,53 --> 0:20:13,801
[MUSIC PLAYING]


423
0:20:13,801 --> 0:20:17,2
MEREDITH DANLUCK: We just
jostled Thomas out of bed for


424
0:20:17,2 --> 0:20:18,52
the sunset.


425
0:20:18,52 --> 0:20:21,1
Is this one, maybe, in the
top five things that


426
0:20:21,1 --> 0:20:22,206
you've never seen?


427
0:20:22,206 --> 0:20:23,41
THOMAS MORTON: I've
seen some things.


428
0:20:23,41 --> 0:20:25,165
JAKE BURGHART: Have you seen
the moon on the other side?


429
0:20:25,165 --> 0:20:27,105
Let's go check that out.


430
0:20:27,105 --> 0:20:28,56
THOMAS MORTON: I'm bored.


431
0:20:28,56 --> 0:20:30,2
JAKE BURGHART: All right,
let's see your point.


432
0:20:30,2 --> 0:20:31,98
Bring your point out a
little to the right.


433
0:20:31,98 --> 0:20:33,18
All right, ready?


434
0:20:33,18 --> 0:20:34,43
Turn back and look
at the camera.


435
0:20:34,43 --> 0:20:37,68



436
0:20:37,68 --> 0:22:37,68
