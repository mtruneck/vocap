Beautiful people, we are going to make a classic
Negroni. An amazing cocktail that I love!


2
0:0:11,2 --> 0:0:16,59
The king of Aperitvo.
This was invented in Florence and the last


3
0:0:16,59 --> 0:0:20,73
name of the guy that invented it was Negroni.
So, first up we've got Gin, right next door


4
0:0:20,73 --> 0:0:25,269
to our modifier which is a sweet vermouth
and then our beautiful bitters. This is good


5
0:0:25,269 --> 0:0:28,57
for stimulating the stomach. Settling the
stomach. It's also good at the end of the


6
0:0:28,57 --> 0:0:31,179
meal to settle the stomach when you eat nice
things.


7
0:0:31,179 --> 0:0:36,91
So, we're gonna go 25ml of gin. And you've
got here, if you see through the bottle, we've


8
0:0:36,91 --> 0:0:40,19
got things like the Juniper berries. That
has to be in the gin as the main ingredient


9
0:0:40,19 --> 0:0:45,0
of course, but you've got lemon peel, coriander,
angelica. All these things grow in my garden,


10
0:0:45,0 --> 0:0:50,0
it's great!
Orrice, no idea what that is but I'm sure it's lovely.


11
0:0:50,0 --> 0:0:55,0
Then 25ml of the sweet vermouth.


12
0:0:55,0 --> 0:1:3,39
So real.... oooh. Ok, not all of that, just half of that!
Sorry I got over excited. It's only natural.


13
0:1:3,39 --> 0:1:11,32
25ml of the bitters. Bitter flavours is very
much a part of very historical, old cooking


14
0:1:11,32 --> 0:1:17,48
both in Britain but absolutely in Italy. You
know all of these kind of botanical, vegetables


15
0:1:17,48 --> 0:1:21,65
and stuff, they're bitter. And bitters is
a very old fashioned part of your palate.


16
0:1:21,65 --> 0:1:30,56
So, 3 equal parts of those great spirits go
in. Now we need to have some dilution of this


17
0:1:30,56 --> 0:1:34,77
cocktail. It's very strong at the moment.
So we're just simply gonna put in a few ice


18
0:1:34,77 --> 0:1:41,53
cubes , use a spoon and just move it around.
So we're just kind of watering down that cocktail,


19
0:1:41,53 --> 0:1:44,86
just a little bit and you know what, that's
probably enough!


20
0:1:44,86 --> 0:1:51,68
So all we have to do now is a little smile
of orange. So a nice fresh orange. And a little


21
0:1:51,68 --> 0:1:56,11
tip - remember we've got bitterness in the
white, well actually we don't want that. But


22
0:1:56,11 --> 0:2:0,91
here in the skin is the oils, the essential
oils, the beautiful flavour. So I'm just gonna


23
0:2:0,91 --> 0:2:7,93
hold it up and I'm just gonna squeeze it and
as I bruise that skin, right, the juice will


24
0:2:7,93 --> 0:2:12,66
come out and it will go through the oil and
that's all. Just a little smile, a little


25
0:2:12,66 --> 0:2:18,239
squeeze, nothing more, nothing less. We'll have another little stir and I'm just gonna top it up with


26
0:2:18,239 --> 0:2:25,54
a few nice ice cubes. That's the job done!
Happy as Larry! There we have a beautiful


27
0:2:25,54 --> 0:2:33,0
classic cocktail. All we gotta do now is have
a little sip.


28
0:2:33,0 --> 0:2:36,9
Spectacular! But of course,


29
0:2:36,9 --> 0:2:43,6
life is too short just to have this great,
classic cocktail. So, if I took the Gin out,


30
0:2:43,6 --> 0:2:49,299
right, and swapped it for Vodka, that would
be called Negroski! So of course look, there's


31
0:2:49,299 --> 0:2:53,45
beautiful things you can do. Top it up with
Prosecco or some soda water. You can lighten


32
0:2:53,45 --> 0:4:53,45
it even. Even beautiful with food! So guys,
cheers! Until next time! Happy stirring! Bye!
