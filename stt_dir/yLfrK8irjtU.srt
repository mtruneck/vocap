SUROOSH ALVI: Yesterday, we came
here with the police for


3
0:0:17,65 --> 0:0:20,41
the operation that felt like
we were on the set of Cops.


4
0:0:20,41 --> 0:0:24,73
We're back here today, much to
the chagrin of the cops, who


5
0:0:24,73 --> 0:0:27,65
say that it's too dangerous to
be here because this is a


6
0:0:27,65 --> 0:0:29,617
Taliban town, and this is where
everyone gets kidnapped


7
0:0:29,617 --> 0:0:30,93
from, and that we shouldn't
be here.


8
0:0:30,93 --> 0:0:32,81
But we wanted to find out from
the people who live here


9
0:0:32,81 --> 0:0:37,4
exactly what they thought of
the operation yesterday.


10
0:0:37,4 --> 0:0:39,4
So let's go see.


11
0:0:39,4 --> 0:0:41,73
Our fixer was very nervous about
being a sitting duck in


12
0:0:41,73 --> 0:0:44,15
the middle of Orangi Town, to
the point where he refused to


13
0:0:44,15 --> 0:0:45,36
get out of the car.


14
0:0:45,36 --> 0:0:47,13
He said we were asking
for trouble.


15
0:0:47,13 --> 0:0:49,79
We promised we'd only ask two
quick questions and then get


16
0:0:49,79 --> 0:0:50,96
the hell out of there.

As soon as we approached those
guys, the vibe suddenly


33
0:1:49,54 --> 0:1:52,35
changed, and I had a sinking
feeling that we had overstayed

The last two people
I went up to, they


41
0:2:24,42 --> 0:2:25,79
refused to talk to us.


42
0:2:25,79 --> 0:2:27,89
I looked over at my corner, and
there was a guy glaring at


43
0:2:27,89 --> 0:2:31,2
me on the phone, making a call
to someone else, which was our


44
0:2:31,2 --> 0:2:32,36
cue to leave.

46
0:2:37,59 --> 0:2:40,24
We didn't get kidnapped in
Orangi Town, so we decided to


47
0:2:40,24 --> 0:2:42,75
push our luck by visiting the
place where the kidnapped


48
0:2:42,75 --> 0:2:44,99
victims are reportedly held--


49
0:2:44,99 --> 0:2:46,132
the dump.


50
0:2:46,132 --> 0:2:48,55
The air was thick with
smoldering rot.


51
0:2:48,55 --> 0:2:51,77

SUROOSH ALVI: Yeah.


69
0:3:21,73 --> 0:3:26,59
We're here, an hour outside of
Karachi, in the largest waste


70
0:3:26,59 --> 0:3:30,21
dump in Karachi, and some
say the largest


71
0:3:30,21 --> 0:3:31,49
waste dump in the world.


72
0:3:31,49 --> 0:3:35,97

is all that's left.


74
0:3:40,71 --> 0:3:44,88
And when the gangsters kidnap
people, the best place to


75
0:3:44,88 --> 0:3:47,63
bring them is just on the other
side of this garbage


76
0:3:47,63 --> 0:3:48,96
dump, because no one ever
comes out there.


77
0:3:48,96 --> 0:3:49,69
I mean, why would they?


78
0:3:49,69 --> 0:3:50,36
It's brutal.


79
0:3:50,36 --> 0:3:51,625
It's like hell on Earth.


80
0:3:51,625 --> 0:3:54,55



81
0:3:54,55 --> 0:3:56,49
I knew that going to one of the
largest garbage dumps in


82
0:3:56,49 --> 0:3:57,24
the world--


83
0:3:57,24 --> 0:3:59,31
70 million square feet
and counting--


84
0:3:59,31 --> 0:4:3,3
would be a miserable experience,
but I was shocked


85
0:4:3,3 --> 0:4:6,16
at just how miserable it was.


86
0:4:6,16 --> 0:4:9,98
When Pakistan became a nation
in 1947, Karachi was home to


87
0:4:9,98 --> 0:4:13,35
about 450,000 people.


88
0:4:13,35 --> 0:4:16,589
Today, there are almost 18
million people producing about


89
0:4:16,589 --> 0:4:21,67
8,000 metric tons of
trash every day.


90
0:4:21,67 --> 0:4:24,66
Scavengers here burn that crash,
sending god knows what


91
0:4:24,66 --> 0:4:28,1
into the air over Karachi, in
order to extract the tiniest


92
0:4:28,1 --> 0:4:32,55
bits of metal that they can sell
to recyclers for pennies.


93
0:4:32,55 --> 0:4:36,26
The UNHCR reports that as many
as 20,000 children spend their


94
0:4:36,26 --> 0:4:39,31
days here in the dump, most of
them refugees from the war in


95
0:4:39,31 --> 0:4:40,56
Afghanistan.


96
0:4:40,56 --> 0:4:45,78



97
0:4:45,78 --> 0:4:48,22
Another effect of the war in
Afghanistan has been a major


98
0:4:48,22 --> 0:4:51,16
increase in the flow of heroin
into Pakistan, and at rock


99
0:4:51,16 --> 0:4:52,3

to buy some heroin.


104
0:4:58,97 --> 0:5:2,645
We're going to buy some
dope with these guys.


105
0:5:2,645 --> 0:5:4,84
And it's weird, because we're
like, hey, can we watch you


106
0:5:4,84 --> 0:5:6,645
guys shoot up and
buy some heroin?


107
0:5:6,645 --> 0:5:9,36
They're like, sure, why not?


108
0:5:9,36 --> 0:5:12,68
Sounds like a perfectly
good idea.


109
0:5:12,68 --> 0:5:15,625
While one gram of heroin can
cost more than $200 in the US,


110
0:5:15,625 --> 0:5:19,1
here in Karachi, it
costs about $0.80.


111
0:5:19,1 --> 0:5:22,92
Wow, we just lost them
dropping down.

0:5:22,92 --> 0:5:24,99
This is the shop for heroin.


113
0:5:24,99 --> 0:5:28,6
Even at these ridiculously low
prices, the market for illegal


114
0:5:28,6 --> 0:5:31,63
opiates in Pakistan is more than
$1 billion annually, with


115
0:5:31,63 --> 0:5:35,49
roughly 160 metric tons of
heroin coming in every year,


116
0:5:35,49 --> 0:5:38,872
feeding the habits of over
four million addicts.


117
0:5:38,872 --> 0:5:41,51
We headed back to these guys'
favorite place to shoot up--


118
0:5:41,51 --> 0:5:42,945
the middle of a busy street.


119
