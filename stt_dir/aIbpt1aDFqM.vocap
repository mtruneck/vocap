###79 INTERVIEWER (OFFSCREEN): How old were you when started
###80 taking drugs?
###82 AMY PROTHEROE (OFFSCREEN): When I first started taking
###84 dope and Valium and things like that, I was 12.
###88 CORNELIUS COLLINS (OFFSCREEN): I was 11 when I started
###89 smoking dope, then Valium and eggs and speed.
###92 AMY PROTHEROE (OFFSCREEN): When I started taking
###94 heroin I was 14.
###95 My mother started giving it to me.
###97 CORNELIUS COLLINS (OFFSCREEN): I was 15 when I started taking
###98 heroin and crack.
###100 I was dealing by the time I was 16 with my father.
###103 AMY PROTHEROE (OFFSCREEN): I was homeless when I was 12.
###107 And when I was 14, I went back to live with my mother, and
###110 within three months of going back to my mother, I was
###113 taking heroin.
###113 She sent me to work in a parlour-- do you know a
###117 massage parlour--
###119 when I was 14, wasn't it?
###121 CORNELIUS COLLINS (OFFSCREEN): It was not a parlour.
###121 It was a fucking whore house, not a massage parlour.
###123 AMY PROTHEROE (OFFSCREEN): Yeah.
###124 When I was 14, she sent me to work in one of them.
###127 CORNELIUS COLLINS (OFFSCREEN): That's the posh word
###127 for them, isn't it?
###128 AMY PROTHEROE (OFFSCREEN): And all the money that I was
###129 earning, I was giving to her and her boyfriend.
###130 CORNELIUS COLLINS (OFFSCREEN): That's because people like us
###132 grow up with parents who are selling drugs and doing drugs,
###134 you learn where you live.
###137 AMY PROTHEROE (OFFSCREEN): You end up copying.
###137 CORNELIUS COLLINS (OFFSCREEN): Right.
###138 You end up kind of doing what your parents did, because you
###141 think that's what's the norm.
###142 That's what normality is to you.
###146 AMY PROTHEROE: Oh, oh.
###148 Amy Protheroe loves Cornelius Collins forever, 2008.
###151 CORNELIUS COLLINS: It's just a little reminder to the world
###153 that she loves me.
###155 AMY PROTHEROE: He's my baby.
###155 I loves him.
###157 We've been together nearly four years, haven't we?
###159 CORNELIUS COLLINS: Yeah.
###159 Well, three years, 9 months.
###162 AMY PROTHEROE: I lied about my age when I got with him.
###164 I told him I was 16.
###165 I was only 15.
###167 I wrote that.
###168 CORNELIUS COLLINS: She did it when I was in jail.
###169 INTERVIEWER (OFFSCREEN): 2008, October last year.
###172 CORNELIUS COLLINS: Yeah.
###172 AMY PROTHEROE: I was on suicide watch.
###174 24/7, they made sure someone was with me all the time,
###177 because I was depressed.
###179 I used to sleep with his red Gap jumper and cuddle into it.
###183 I never washed it.
###184 I'd smell him, yeah?
###185 CORNELIUS COLLINS: Don't--
###186 hey.
###187 AMY PROTHEROE: But we've had some hard times, haven't we?
###194 We've had a lot of trouble.
###195 We recently lost a baby.
###197 
###200 Didn't we, Corneil?
###201 We recently lost our baby.
###202 CORNELIUS COLLINS: Sort me out with a glug of that.
###204 AMY PROTHEROE: Didn't we?
###204 CORNELIUS COLLINS: Let's talk about better things, Amy.
###206 AMY PROTHEROE: No, wait.
###206 But I'm explaining, that's how we went downhill so rapidly.
###208 CORNELIUS COLLINS: Well, whatever, innit.
###209 AMY PROTHEROE: I was eight and a half months pregnant.
###210 My baby was born stillborn.
###212 I had a little boy.
###214 And after that happened, we just started drinking really
###218 heavily, didn't we, babes?
###219 Because we never used to drink.
###222 You hated drinking, didn't you?
###223 CORNELIUS COLLINS: Yep.
###223 I did.
###223 AMY PROTHEROE: We started off drinking a little bit, and
###225 then when the baby died, that was it, our heads went.
###228 
###232 CORNELIUS COLLINS: Give us a glug on that, babes, please.
###234 AMY PROTHEROE: I don't want to, shove off.
###235 CORNELIUS COLLINS: No, man.
###236 Oh, this one's fucking dirty.
###237 [INAUDIBLE].
###238 
###241 ANDREW WILLIAMSON: Lighter?
###241 The lighter?
###242 
###246 Where's that filter?
###249 You're a dozy fucker.
###250 
###260 Lighter.
###261 Lighter.
###264 It's like talking to the fucking wall
###266 with you lot, man.
###267 CORNELIUS COLLINS: Haven't got a lighter.
###269 ANDREW WILLIAMSON: Amy, have you got a lighter?
###270 
###310 [WHISTLES]
###310 ANDREW WILLIAMSON: Yeah, that's nice as fuck, that is.
###312 Lovely gear, that is.
###314 [WHISTLES]
###360 ANDREW WILLIAMSON (OFFSCREEN): I wish I'd said
###361 this when I was sober.
###363 
###367 I'm having to maintain myself on a seriously addictive drug.
###371 
###390 Just make sure you wait for me.
###391 I'll come into town with you, innit?
###393 CORNELIUS COLLINS: We'll meet you round the
###394 back of the YM, yeah?
###395 
###400 DEREK JAMES: I heard a definition many years ago
###403 about the difference a North Walian and a South Walian.
###406 And the difference was between belt and braces.
###409 The South Walian always wore a belt slung under his beer
###413 belly, and was a roistering, boisterous taffy.
###417 Whereas a North Walian always wore braces and hunched them
###421 forward as if he were forever plodding uphill.
###425 Most of the coal that was mined in the Swansea area and
###428 up the Swansea Valley was used in Swansea
###432 for the metal refining.
###435 Swansea was then, at one time, the major metal refining
###441 center for the entire world.
###443 That's an example from the old days, when children were
###446 underground.
###447 And it was only about 1840- odd that they raised the age
###451 of children working underground to 12.
###454 But no, Mrs. Thatcher shut the lot down.
###457 It's awful when you think that the amount of skill and the
###459 amount of knowledge that was here, the knowledge base that
###462 they had, and it all just withered away.
###464 
###468 Employment after the heavy industry went as not good.
###470 There was a short period in the '60s when there was quite
###474 a lot of work around.
###475 But that declined all through the '70s and the '80s, until
###479 the late '90s.
###482 Yeah, that's played a part in the present drug problem, I
###487 think, in Swansea, and the alcoholism.
###491 Of course, the system under which we live--
###494 the capitalist system-- is so competitive.
###497 And it's a continual stress on the individual.
###501 And younger people, I feel, who can't get into the stream
###506 and compete and can't get work just lose heart.
###511 And then they descend into a drug culture, which is almost
###517 a subculture now.
###518 DANIELLE GRAY: (SINGING) Swansea, oh
###519 Swansea, Swansea City.
###523 Living on the lamppost until the day I die.
###526 (SPEAKING) Something like that, isn't it?
###527 JOSIE: My name's Josie.
###529 DANIELLE GRAY: My name is Danielle Gray
###531 and I'm from Swansea.
###533 We're stepsisters.
###533 JOSIE: We're stepsisters.
###534 DANIELLE GRAY: That we are.
###535 INTERVIEWER (OFFSCREEN): Stepsisters.
###535 DANIELLE GRAY: There's 12 of us all together.
###536 INTERVIEWER (OFFSCREEN): Right.
###537 DANIELLE GRAY: There's me, Rachel, Ciaran, Becca, Teagan,
###543 Gemma, Emma, then it's Ryan, Reagan, Brandon,
###550 and Timmy and Teagan.
###553 And my daughter's named Courtney-Lee--
###555 28th of the fifth--
###556 it's a bit faded at the moment.
###558 JOSIE: "Dad", I put there.
###560 DANIELLE GRAY: They're prison tattoos, they are.
###561 JOSIE: I got "Mum" there.
###562 DANIELLE GRAY: You've got her ex-missus
###562 named Leanne up there.
###564 That's fucked it off.
###565 JOSIE: Fucked off.
###565 My ex-girlfriend's name there.
###566 I've got my ex-boyfriend's name--
###570 DANIELLE GRAY: On that side, isn't it?
###571 Yeah, Mark.
###572 I got a daughter.
###573 She's three years old now.
###575 And if you look there, I got a Cesarean, from there to there.
###580 I sees her every Tuesday between 10:00 and 12:00.
###582 She's brilliant.
###584 She goes, Mummy, Dani, where's my daddy?
###588 I goes, working away.
###589 But he was in prison.
###590 He came out the other day.
###591 No, she doesn't want to see him and that.
###594 Two days ago, my mother was a bit drunk, and she hit me.
###598 I hit her back.
###599 And she bit my nose from there to there.
###601 INTERVIEWER (OFFSCREEN): What happened to your face there?
###602 JOSIE: Oh, I was jumped by two girls, I was.
###605 INTERVIEWER (OFFSCREEN): Right.
###605 In Swansea?
###606 DANIELLE GRAY: Yeah.
###607 It's gone down.
###607 Rough area.
###608 JOSIE: Rough, yeah.
###609 DANIELLE GRAY: Real rough area.
###610 INTERVIEWER (OFFSCREEN): Why?
###610 JOSIE: Because of the drugs.
###611 DANIELLE GRAY: But now you've got kids at ages 12 and 13--
###615 JOSIE: Taking heroin.
###616 DANIELLE GRAY: They're taking heroin.
###617 JOSIE: There's dealers selling it to them--
###619 DANIELLE GRAY: Exactly.
###620 JOSIE: And they don't really care about them, as long as
###622 they get their money.
###623 DANIELLE GRAY: They won't care if a 12-year-old or an 11
###626 goes, oh, have you got a bag and that?
###628 Oh, yeah, have you got a tenner?
###629 Yeah, here's a bag and that.
###630 Do you know what I mean?
###631 JOSIE: They just don't care.
###632 DANIELLE GRAY: No.
###632 They should have more respect.
###634 
###639 CORNELIUS COLLINS: Right, you've got SANDS, which is for
###641 over-18s, and Sandpit, down in Nash House, for under-18s.
###646 This is a drug agency.
###649 They offer counseling.
###650 They can help you get on opiate prescribing--
###654 methadone, Subutex, Suboxone Needle exchange.
###658 They do a men's day on a Wednesday, when you go in and
###660 have some toast and tea, and just have a chat with all the
###664 boys in there.
###666 JOHN FRITH: Thanks, Lynn.
###667 Is everybody here?
###668 
###671 This is another counseling room, which we'd
###673 call a family room.
###675 First point of call would normally be the needle
###677 exchange, where we'd first engage with--
###679 INTERVIEWER (OFFSCREEN): Why's that?
###680 JOHN FRITH: A lot of them would actually come here and
###684 be asking for clean needles.
###686 And so we've got the cookers, then.
###689 This is the most popular type of needle.
###694 So this is a 1 mil syringe.
###697 You hear about people drawing up water from puddles.
###700 We have got water ampules as well, which you can put in the
###704 cooker and mix with the heroin.
###706 People will still use whether we were here or not.
###710 Where there's a way, they'll find a way.
###712 You can actually inject into your anus, where there's lots
###716 of blood vessels close to the surface.
###720 People are beginning to inject crack now.
###725 Most people are still actually smoking it.
###728 ANDREW WILLIAMSON: This is how complicated it is to get
###729 drugs, but this is to get crack.
###731 Basically, I've got to get there.
###734 I'll ring him on the way-- say I'm in a taxi.
###737 I meet him by a certain shop.
###739 Hello?
###741 Yeah?
###743 Righto.
###745 No, I will.
###746 I will comply.
###748 At 11:30.
###749 And what's the time now?
###750 
###756 Righto.
###756 Right.
###756 OK.
###757 OK, I'll be there at 11:30.
###761 [INAUDIBLE].
###762 
###764 My drug worker, that was.
###766 I got a phone call about my medication, because I'm banned
###768 from the building, due to an incident.
###771 I've got to meet the lady outside there at half past 11.
###774 And she'll go through things with me.
###775 And it's involving my methadone prescription, it is.
###781 I'm on my way up in a taxi now, mate, yeah?
###783 I've got to be back by the YMCA at ha;f past 11.
###787 So, step on it, driver, as they say in the films.
###791 Yeah, I take crack recreationally.
###793 It's not something I make a habit of doing.
###796 It's not physically addictive, so it's--
###798 INTERVIEWER (OFFSCREEN): You don't think so?
###800 ANDREW WILLIAMSON: Well, textbook, it's
###803 not physically addictive.
###804 I have come off it before.
###806 And I have vomited blood.
###808 I drank 60 mil of methadone.
###810 And then an hour later, I injected 2 mil of Subutex.
###815 And I tell you what, it was one of the worst cold turkeys
###818 I've ever been through in my entire life.
###821 Any users who watch this program, never ever do that.
###825 I don't want to be vulgar, yeah, but you could have
###828 fitted a watermelon up my asshole, that's how disg--
###834 it came out of me like piss.
###836 And I laid on my bed with my eyes like 50 pence pieces--
###840 the old 50 pence pieces.
###842 I'm there now, yeah.
###844 
###855 INTERVIEWER (OFFSCREEN): You all right?
###856 ANDREW WILLIAMSON: Yeah, safe, sorted.
###857 INTERVIEWER (OFFSCREEN): Good.
###859 ANDREW WILLIAMSON: That's the crack.
###863 Kim, it's Andrew, it is.
###865 Right, love, I'm going to be about 10 minutes later, is
###868 that all right?
###868 Yeah, I know, I know.
###869 But I've got to pick up a counter payment from the job
###871 center, see?
###872 Yeah, no.
###873 This won't happen again.
###874 This is a one off.
###875 Yeah, I know, love, but please.
###877 I promise you I'll be 10 minutes, at the most, late.
###882 Yeah, no.
###882 I didn't realize I was going to get a phone call saying to
###884 be at the job center.
###886 I got a phone call after I spoke to you,
###888 you know what I mean?
###888 I didn't realize this was going to happen.
###891 OK, my love, I'll be there.
###893 OK, thanks.
###894 Bye.
###896 ooh.
###897 She weren't happy.
###899 She bought it.
###900 Oh, Jesus.
###902 Christ.
###903 
###915 Ah, Shit.

###1003 residue collects, and you can clean it out.
###1008 And what you clean out is better than what you smoked
###1010 the first time round.
###1012 One more pipe, boys, and we're away.
###1014 
###1028 Fuck it.
###1029 
###1045 Aw, I left your lighter, didn't I?
###1047 Ah, for fuck's sake.

###1085 She might have someone--
###1086 I was wondering, they might have someone waiting there to
###1090 maybe arrest me for the theft of the magazines.
###1094 Ah, come on, mate.
###1096 Please.
###1097 Get out of the fucking way.
###1100 Oh my god, what's this traffic?
###1102 It's driving me nuts.
###1103 Well, mate, I'm going to get out and run, yeah?
###1105 
###1113 LEE DENNIS: Well, we've known each other years.
###1117 I mean, we always used to bump into each other and talk.
###1120 RACHEL REES: We used to have a nice chat, didn't we?
###1124 LEE DENNIS: I mean, she's a tidy girl, like.
###1127 RACHEL REES: My ex was giving me a few hidings here and
###1130 there, like.
###1131 Dennis is there.
###1133 Have a chat with Dennis-- this, that, and the other.
###1135 Tidy guy.
###1137 And that's how we clicked, really.
###1140 LEE DENNIS: I mean, I've always had a little
###1141 soft spot for her.
###1143 RACHEL REES: We'll see how it goes from here now, isn't it?
###1145 LEE DENNIS: Yeah.
###1145 RACHEL REES: Just take it day by day and help each other out
###1148 as much as we can.
###1150 Yeah?
###1152 LEE DENNIS: February 27, I got out of jail.
###1154 But when I moved in here, it was stinking.
###1159 This is my bedroom.
###1160 I'm gonna put my bed down here.
###1163 Put the bed down here--
###1165 I got my bedside cabinet--
###1167 and lay the carpet and put my wardrobes down here and my
###1174 chest of drawers behind the door.
###1176 
###1181 RACHEL REES: You can't put it in your ear, can he?
###1183 LEE DENNIS: It's all right like that.
###1186 That's my first ever Swansea City tattoo--
###1190 the proudest ever.
###1192 I've been to a few prisons, as well, and I always wear it
###1197 with pride, always walk around with my top off.
###1200 And I want to get clean.
###1201 I'm starting treatment now on the 26th of this month.
###1205 Because I tattooed myself in jail, I had test results done.
###1209 I had a letter then from the nurse, saying come
###1213 down and see me.
###1215 I need to see you urgently.
###1217 And when I went down, she says, I'm very sorry, but you
###1220 have got hep C. I'm gonna try a cupboard, put a
###1225 cupboard up on here.
###1227 I'm gonna paint the ceiling.
###1229 I'm gonna paint that.
###1231 It'll probably be tomorrow.
###1233 And look, there's bits of blood.
###1236 When you're cooking up and that, you draw
###1238 the blood into yourself.
###1241 And when you draw so much in, there's a little bit of blood
###1245 left in, and they just squirt it.
###1249 There was some on here as well.
###1251 I put a bit on there.
###1253 My stereo's in my mum's it is.
###1256 INTERVIEWER (OFFSCREEN): Why?
###1256 What kind of music do you like?
###1258 LEE DENNIS: I like all different types of music.
###1259 I got loads of music here.
###1261 
###1266 R&B, Garage, R&B, Fleetwood Mac Seven Wonders--
###1274 if I live to see the Seven Wonders.
###1277 RACHEL REES: There was an abscess.
###1279 I had to go in for an operation on that, because I
###1283 missed there.
###1287 You know, basically, my veins are kaput now.
###1293 That's going into another abscess.
###1295 
###1298 That one's not too bad.
###1300 If I wasn't on the heroin, I'd cry my eyes out for my kids
###1304 now, you know?
###1306 Don't get me wrong, I love them all to bits, but you
###1311 know, I can't really see them while I'm in this predicament.
###1315 LEE DENNIS: This is gonna go up in my bedroom.
###1317 
###1321 RACHEL REES: Other way round, babes.
###1325 LEE DENNIS: Is that all right?
###1327 RACHEL REES: The other way, babes.
###1329 
###1333 LEE DENNIS: (SINGING) When I was just a little boy, I asked
###1338 my mother, what shall I be?
###1341 Shall I be Swansea?
###1343 Shall I be scum?
###1345 This is what she said to me.
###1348 Take your father's gun, and shoot the Cardiff scum.
###1354 Forever will be, my son.
###1357 You'll always be Swansea.

###1368 LEE ANDERSON: Lee Anderson, in Swansea, like, in a shared
###1372 flat, with smackheads, down and outs.
###1375 CLINT RYAN JONES: Aye.
###1375 All right?
###1377 This is Clint, the old famous Clinty.
###1379 This is a friend's bedsit, as they call it.
###1384 He said I could stay here for a couple of days, so I've made
###1387 myself a room.
###1388 [FARTING]
###1391 LEE ANDERSON: Oh, had to come out, didn't it?
###1393 CLINT RYAN JONES: I started a program now with methadone.
###1396 It's done me a world of good.
###1397 For some people, it'll make them worse.
###1399 And then they have a heroin habit on top
###1404 of a methadone habit.
###1406 LEE ANDERSON: It's people like Clint are stupid.
###1408 They think it's the answer.
###1410 But it's not.
###1411 INTERVIEWER (OFFSCREEN): You disagree with him?
###1413 CLINT RYAN JONES: It's going again in a minute.
###1414 [FARTING]
###1416 CLINT RYAN JONES: Right.
###1416 Better out than in, isn't it?
###1417 You know what I mean?
###1418 Because I went off the heroin, and when I get to that point
###1422 when it's making me better, I'll stop using heroin, and
###1425 then eventually, in a couple of months, gradually come off
###1429 the methadone.
###1430 And I'll be a brand new, squeaky clean person again.
###1434 LEE ANDERSON: With rotten teeth.
###1435 
###1440 KRISTIAN EVANS: I've been on it since I can remember--
###1443 14, which is the best part of my life.
###1444 CLINT RYAN JONES: Anyway, I'm just doing about
###1445 my day to day thing.
###1446 Come on, let's go down the shop now.
###1448 KRISTIAN EVANS: Is it?
###1449 LEE ANDERSON (OFFSCREEN): Come along if you want.
###1450 KRISTIAN EVANS: Hm?
###1451 Well, if it's all about him-- he's a fucking idiot.
###1454 CLINT RYAN JONES: Before I had the bedsit, this is where we
###1456 used to go up to have a dig.
###1458 "Dig up" means inject your heroin and what have you.
###1462 Bish, bash, bosh.
###1463 LEE ANDERSON: Look, there's pin tops.
###1464 Look, there, where he's standing.
###1466 CLINT RYAN JONES: This is where we used to go for a
###1468 pipe, down here.
###1468 This is where we used to go.
###1469 LEE ANDERSON: We started--
###1472 we get the needles from there.
###1473 KRISTIAN EVANS: It's our fault why the
###1475 needles are down there.
###1476 LEE ANDERSON: Yeah.
###1476 People should clean up.
###1476 KRISTIAN EVANS: They give us things--
###1478 CLINT RYAN JONES: Hang on, let me put this camera right now.
###1479 Hang on.
###1480 It's not our fault the needles are down there.
###1482 We clean up what we used to use.
###1484 KRISTIAN EVANS: Yeah, yeah.
###1484 CLINT RYAN JONES: Months ago, when I used to come here, I
###1487 always used to take my doings with me and put them in the
###1490 same bin and take them back to the drug project.
###1492 The dirty smackheads that are around that leave needles
###1494 about then and what have you--
###1496 we are the clean smackheads, the user.
###1498 We are users, not smackheads.
###1501 Whoa, watch you don't sit on any fucking needles, mate.
###1504 KRISTIAN EVANS: I would have thought the heroin
###1506 consumption--
###1507 considering that 90% of heroin comes from Afghanistan, how
###1512 much has come into the country, considering a our
###1515 British troops--
###1516 CLINT RYAN JONES: But it's not all about fucking
###1516 Afghanistan, really.
###1518 Why are we using it, you know?
###1520 KRISTIAN EVANS: Yes, I know.
###1521 But the documentary's about how there's
###1524 been such an increase.
###1524 CLINT RYAN JONES: Yeah, but they want to know about
###1525 Swansea and things--
###1526 why are we using it so much?
###1527 And basically, at the end of the day--
###1529 KRISTIAN EVANS: Well, I wasn't talking about that.
###1530 CLINT RYAN JONES: Why?
###1530 Because there's boredom.
###1532 KRISTIAN EVANS: I think that a lot of heroin addicts are
###1534 using the actual, "oh, I'm addicted to heroin" to get
###1541 away with the way that they're looking, the way that they
###1544 talk to people, and the actual way that
###1549 they live their lifestyle.
###1550 I like to think that I've proven them all wrong.
###1553 I've been a heroin addict since I was 18 years of age,
###1557 which is nearly 10 years.
###1558 Yeah, I'm well known around town for shoplifting to fund
###1561 for my habit.
###1562 But fingers crossed, that if someone walked past me in the
###1566 street, they wouldn't think that I was a
###1568 dodgy-looking bastard--
###1571 excuse my French--
###1572 and consider me to look like a typical smackhead like you see
###1577 off Trainspotting, you know?
###1579 I can't see any reason why I can't turn my life around.
###1584 LEE ANDERSON: [INAUDIBLE].
###1587 [INAUDIBLE].
###1590 CLINT RYAN JONES: OK, we having a dig, are we?
###1591 MAN (OFFSCREEN): Yeah.
###1592 CLINT RYAN JONES: Positive mental attitude, as I put
###1594 underneath.
###1595 You know, I wake up in the bed in the morning, and I thought,
###1597 I see the sign that's on the wall.
###1600 So I look and I think, right.
###1601 PMA, PMA--
###1605 Positive Mental Attitude.
###1606 So, at the end of the day, positive mental attitude.
###1609 Right, what am I going to do today?
###1610 Straight to the chemist-- they'll have my methadone--
###1613 positive mental attitude.
###1614 There's one.
###1614 Number two, go and score a fucking bag.
###1621 Positive mental attitude, yeah?
###1623 
###1626 My spelling's not too good, though.
###1627 Sorry.
###1629 
###1634 I just want to be part of my kids and my ex-wife, you know?
###1637 I just want the chance to be a daddy, yeah?
###1640 I love my babies.
###1642 I said to myself, PMA.
###1646 I'm going to stop using any type of drug before I get in
###1650 touch with my children ever again, because it wouldn't be
###1653 fair on my children if I was to go, oh, that's
###1657 my daddy, that is.
###1657 Ah, but your daddy's a junkie.
###1659 
###1662 CORNELIUS COLLINS (OFFSCREEN): My old man's never been on the
###1663 streets, homeless.
###1666 He's just been a junkie and a drug dealer most of his life,
###1669 and a burglar, and in and out of jail.
###1674 He's not selling drugs at the moment or committing crime,
###1677 but he's still using drugs.
###1681 SEAN COLLINS: Please don't litter or
###1682 urinate on the stairs.
###1683 They want to put with that "or use needles." That's for them
###1687 to have a boot, smoke the heroin on the foil That's
###1691 probably two days, between three.
###1693 INTERVIEWER (OFFSCREEN): So how many do you drink a day?
###1696 SEAN COLLINS: About 12 each.
###1702 About 12 each, yeah.
###1706 Come on.
###1707 Come on, Celine.
###1710 LIBBY COLLINS (OFFSCREEN): No, you can't have a joint.
###1712 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Of course we can.
###1713 MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, you can.

###1720 CARLO: Can you just get one between me and you?
###1722 LIBBY COLLINS: Why?
###1723 Dad.
###1724 SEAN COLLINS (OFFSCREEN): I put it on top of
###1725 there, right by you.
###1727 LIBBY COLLINS: Four cans, Dad!
###1729 CORNELIUS COLLINS: Yeah, no, it is.
###1730 Sorry, I've picked yours up.
###1733 LIBBY COLLINS: Dad, come here.
###1734 Dad, just come here a sec.
###1738 It's in your hand.
###1739 SEAN COLLINS: It's not.
###1739 I just opened it.
###1740 LIBBY COLLINS: Yeah, and you've got one in the fridge.
###1742 Come here.
###1742 SEAN COLLINS: No, I haven't.
###1743 LIBBY COLLINS: Yes, you have.
###1743 That one in the fridge is yours, Daddy.
###1745 CORNELIUS COLLINS: That's Carlo, my sister's boyfriend.
###1747 This is my sister, Libby.
###1749 LIBBY COLLINS: Hi.
###1750 CORNELIUS COLLINS (OFFSCREEN): My old man, Sean.
###1752 Dad's mate, Darren.
###1754 And my missus, Amy, who you've met already.
###1755 CARLO: Well, I've known her for years, but we recently got
###1758 to meet on the streets, yeah?
###1759 LIBBY COLLINS: Yeah, we met drinking in town.
###1761 CARLO: In town.
###1761 Drinking in town.
###1762 INTERVIEWER (OFFSCREEN): In the last four years,
###1763 everyone's said there's been a lot more heroin in Swansea.
###1765 Is that true?
###1766 LIBBY COLLINS: Oh, yeah.
###1767 SEAN COLLINS: Lots of it.
###1768 You've got to go back from the '60s.
###1770 You've got to take it from the '60s, really.
###1773 You could do chemists, and it'd be amazing.
###1777 You know, it's be wooden--
###1777 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Morphine and--
###1778 SEAN COLLINS: Shut up.
###1779 Shh.
###1780 Shut up.
###1780 LIBBY COLLINS (OFFSCREEN): People of these days, they're
###1781 just growing up--
###1782 CARLO (OFFSCREEN): They're growing up around it.
###1782 Yeah.
###1783 LIBBY COLLINS (OFFSCREEN): Everybody's doing gear,
###1784 because everybody's doing it.
###1786 You know, people just don't care now, because their mother
###1790 or their father or their brother or their
###1791 cousin is doing it.
###1791 They're all doing it.
###1791 SEAN COLLINS: It don't make no difference about your mother
###1794 or your father--
###1795 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Of course it do.
###1795 SEAN COLLINS: It's about you.
###1796 It's about you.
###1797 It's your brain.
###1798 LIBBY COLLINS (OFFSCREEN): Look at kids now.
###1799 10, 20 years ago, it was different.
###1801 Look at them now.
###1802 SEAN COLLINS: And yet my--
###1804 LIBBY COLLINS (OFFSCREEN): [INAUDIBLE]
###1807 No, hang on.
###1808 I'm not saying it's the parents' responsibility.
###1810 What I'm saying is, if you're round people doing it.
###1813 If your mother and your father, your aunt and your
###1815 uncle, or anybody that's around you 24/7 is on heroin,
###1817 obviously, you're going to take it.
###1819 I'm not blaming you or Mammy, Dad.
###1821 I'm just saying, I got sucked into the wrong circle.
###1824 DARREN: [INAUDIBLE].
###1826 SEAN COLLINS: Right.
###1827 Hang on, now.
###1828 How did you get sucked into it?
###1831 I never used in front of you.
###1832 Your mother never used in front of you.
###1834 CORNELIUS COLLINS: Right.
###1835 As a kid, I did catch you dosed up on the toilet with
###1837 the works in your arms.
###1837 Shit like that.
###1838 Yeah?
###1838 SEAN COLLINS: Yeah.
###1839 CORNELIUS COLLINS: Right, started
###1840 smoking fags and drinking.
###1841 Then I went to smoking dope.
###1842 Then I went to smoking dope with you.
###1844 Seeing you smoking dope once I'd started smoking dope.
###1847 But that's part of it, isn't it?
###1848 Drink and drugs.
###1850 That's the circle you're in.
###1852 LIBBY COLLINS (OFFSCREEN): He shouldn't have been should he?
###1854 CORNELIUS COLLINS: Not now, I've got an abscess.
###1855 SEAN COLLINS: I know.
###1856 I've never laid a finger on him.
###1860 I think once I hit you, didn't I?
###1862 One time.
###1863 LIBBY COLLINS (OFFSCREEN): Don't get into this now.
###1864 Speak to these questions.
###1864 SEAN COLLINS: And that was in another house.
###1865 AMY PROTHEROE: How long was you homeless for, Carlo?
###1867 CARLO: I'm lucky at the moment.
###1868 I've got a girlfriend with a flat at the moment.
###1870 So god knows what's gonna happen if she kicks me out.
###1875 LIBBY COLLINS: Well, if you were a bit nicer, you wouldn't
###1877 be worrying, would you, love?
###1879 CORNELIUS COLLINS: How many times have you been into detox
###1880 and rehab and whatever?
###1882 SEAN COLLINS: Detox.
###1883 I've been to detox about--
###1886 CORNELIUS COLLINS: 10, 12 times?
###1887 SEAN COLLINS: 10, 12 times.
###1889 I didn't stay that long.
###1890 CORNELIUS COLLINS: My mother and father split up--
###1893 AMY PROTHEROE: Ask if his mother got clean.
###1894 CORNELIUS COLLINS: When I 13.
###1895 My mother got clean.
###1897 I stayed with Dad.
###1898 [INAUDIBLE].
###1899 SEAN COLLINS: Not my fault, I said.
###1901 Look at her, sticking her oar in.
###1902 CORNELIUS COLLINS: In and out of detox, rehab, whatever.
###1905 LIBBY COLLINS (OFFSCREEN): Mammy and Daddy fought fucking
###1906 and got clean for 8 weeks.
###1906 SEAN COLLINS: It'll be like Jeremy Kyle now.
###1907 CORNELIUS COLLINS: I just pissed a
###1908 whole day on that one.
###1909 SEAN COLLINS: Let me tell you something now.
###1910 She's one bitch.
###1911 CORNELIUS COLLINS: Ah, Dad, give it up now, will you?
###1913 Don't speak about her like that.
###1914 It's not nice.
###1915 SEAN COLLINS: All right, she's not a bitch.
###1916 I didn't mean to insult dogs, sorry.
###1920 AMY PROTHEROE: It's a long story.
###1921 SEAN COLLINS: No, it's not.
###1922 It's a short story.
###1923 If I have a minute with my son, Amy seems to think that
###1929 that little bit of love in that minute, she's losing.
###1933 She won't allow us about five minutes together.
###1936 AMY PROTHEROE: You're the same, though, Sean.
###1937 SEAN COLLINS: Quiet.
###1938 Hurry up, because you've got one minute now, right?
###1942 [MUSIC - DUNVANT MALE VOICE CHOIR SINGING]
###1945 SEAN COLLINS: I used to beat you when you
###1947 were a little baby.
###1947 LIBBY COLLINS: Shut up, Dad.
###1949 SEAN COLLINS: All I'm saying is the truth.
###1950 She's one evil person.
###1952 [ALL CHATTERING]
###1964 LIBBY COLLINS: Come on, then, sit up here.
###1965 
###1977 CORNELIUS COLLINS: Cheese.
###1979 It's a chaotic family I got, isn't it?
###1981 LIBBY COLLINS: There'll be no chaos.
###1982 Excuse me, you've got a loving family.
###1984 
###2018 [CHOIR SINGING]
###2066 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): In the old days, the way to get
###2067 out of a situation was boxing.
###2071 If you wanted to earn a bit of money, you wanted to become a
###2073 professional, you wanted to get a bit of money, people
###2075 went into boxing.
###2076 So it was physical.
###2077 
###2081 The working environment was more physical.
###2083 Now we look around, and there's no jobs
###2086 left for the kids.
###2087 And, same as anything else, they want to make a few bob.
###2091 And then you've got the people who've got these drugs.
###2094 Right, OK, go and sell these.
###2096 Take them into schoolyards, where, I know from personal
###2099 experience, 11 year olds have been given cannabis and things
###2103 in schoolyards.
###2105 And it comes down to an economic climate, if you like.
###2109 That person will grow up to be 18, 19, perhaps meet a girl,
###2113 get married--
###2115 drug problem is still there.
###2116 The children see the parents with a drug problem, and it's
###2120 just a never-ending circle.
###2122 When the factories closed down and the docks closed down, and
###2126 you've got the coal tippers gone from the docks.
###2127 BP closed down.
###2129 Then the steel company cut back.
###2131 And then you got all the building firms that were
###2133 pulling out.
###2134 
###2136 Depression can do a lot of things to a lot of people.
###2138 I can understand why these kids get so depressed and turn
###2144 to something like drugs, alcohol, whatever.
###2148 It's a sad indictment of our society that at 30 years of
###2151 age, you're on the rubbish heap.
###2153 MALE SPEAKER: It's not that the city was changed.
###2154 It's the people that's changed It's all about derelict
###2161 warehouses on the back of the strand
###2163 down there, for instance.
###2165 They're now about to be taken over by a lap dancing company.
###2171 So, showing your knickers off in a club for a couple of
###2173 quid-- that's OK, is it?
###2175 I don't think so.
###2178 All I can say is only a total idiot would pay money at the
###2181 door to go in and watch crap like that.
###2184 And if I had a grandchild--
###2185 and I've got a couple of granddaughters, actually,
###2187 well, three--
###2189 I would hammer them with that.
###2191 
###2214 FEMALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): This is just basically my job
###2216 at the moment, which is really good.
###2219 It's good fun, pouring alcohol down each other's necks,
###2222 getting wet, breathing fire, stripping off.
###2226 Like, trying something different and wearing really
###2230 sexy, beautiful clothes.
###2231 FEMALE SPEAKER: My parents know.
###2232 Yeah, they think it's brilliant.
###2234 It gives me confidence.
###2235 I wasn't normally a confident person.
###2238 It's given me a world of confidence.
###2240 I really enjoy it.
###2241 FEMALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Yeah, my
###2241 parents think it's awesome.
###2242 My nan actually thinks it's amazing.
###2244 She said if she was like 60 years younger, she'd do it.
###2248 But, yeah, she's a bit old to do it.
###2249 But they love it.
###2250 FEMALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): My mum wants to come do it too.
###2253 She wants to come and dance around the poles.
###2255 FEMALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): I think they're actually proud
###2257 of the fact that we're going out there, and we're
###2260 independent females who can do this kind of thing and just be
###2263 amazingly proud of it.
###2263 We have a really good time.
###2265 
###2279 [DOG BARKING]
###2284 MALE SPEAKER: I've been living here for 12 years.
###2286 INTERVIEWER (OFFSCREEN): Yeah, and how old are you now?
###2287 MALE SPEAKER: 13.
###2288 INTERVIEWER (OFFSCREEN): OK.
###2288 And how old are you?
###2289 MALE SPEAKER: 14.
###2289 MALE SPEAKER: Prostitutes all the way down there.
###2292 MALE SPEAKER: In those flats there.
###2295 MALE SPEAKER: Goofy as hell.
###2297 They've got [INAUDIBLE] all over-- one girl,
###2299 all over her teeth.
###2300 She hadn't got none.
###2301 They were false.
###2302 Loads of boys speak about her and that--
###2305 like loads of junkies and all that.
###2307 INTERVIEWER (OFFSCREEN): What do they do, the junkies?
###2309 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Inject
###2309 themselves on the street.
###2311 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Couple of them died the other
###2313 day up there, didn't they?
###2314 MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.
###2314 A boy, he took Valium, isn't it?
###2316 And he died then.
###2318 
###2321 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): No, I don't like the Muslims.
###2322 INTERVIEWER (OFFSCREEN): You don't like them.
###2323 Why not?
###2324 MALE SPEAKER: Because they wouldn't like
###2325 it if we all emigrated.
###2327 They wouldn't like it if we all emigrated over to their
###2329 countries, so why should they come over to our country?
###2332 MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, and they comes down here, works, gets
###2334 the money, and then goes back to their
###2335 country and spends it.
###2337 They don't spend it here.
###2338 
###2343 TAHA IDRIS: When somebody has got no job, no income, et
###2347 cetera, and you go and tell them, have you seen the people
###2351 out there, the black people taking our jobs?
###2355 People tend to believe that sort of thing.
###2358 Swansea's a very peaceful place.
###2360 You know, it has always been a very peaceful place.
###2363 I've lived here for almost 40 years, and I can honestly say
###2367 that there has never been any major discord.
###2371 The only time I've ever seen a big protest, demonstration in
###2375 Swansea, where people actually joined in thousands, was
###2379 protesting against the killing of Kala Kawa Karim, or
###2382 anything of that nature.
###2383 FEMALE SPEAKER: Hey!
###2384 Who is it?
###2385 Who are you?
###2386 TAHA IDRIS: Goodness me.
###2387 FEMALE SPEAKER: Abdul!
###2389 TAHA IDRIS: Why?
###2391 INTERVIEWER (OFFSCREEN): Why?
###2392 TAHA IDRIS: Yeah, come on through.
###2392 INTERVIEWER (OFFSCREEN): Who are you?
###2392 FEMALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Abdul!
###2394 
###2401 INTERVIEWER (OFFSCREEN): "Abdul."
###2403 TAHA IDRIS: There we are.
###2405 That's what happens.
###2407 You get used to it, honestly.
###2410 You get used to it.
###2410 And you start thinking, well, if there is that sort of
###2415 attitudes around, you can't do anything about it.
###2418 CORNELIUS COLLINS: A mosque?
###2419 Fuck.
###2420 Are you taking the piss, man?
###2421 Why do they want to open another--
###2423 a wosque-- a mosque, when there's one opposite?
###2427 There's one across the road.
###2429 AMY PROTHEROE: I got arrested for being racist, right?
###2431 But he said something behind my back.
###2432 CORNELIUS COLLINS: He called her white trash, so she
###2434 slapped him and smashed a window.
###2436 He says to her, show me your tits, and I'll give you free
###2438 kebab meat.
###2440 Cheeky cunt, innit he?
###2442 
###2455 MALE SPEAKER: Fuck off.
###2458 ALL CHANTING: Nazi scum, off our streets!
###2460 
###2468 MALE SPEAKER: What, then?
###2469 What, then?
###2469 POLICE OFFICER: I want your full name.

###2479 MALE SPEAKER: Just charge forward.
###2481 Give it some of that.

###2491 MALE SPEAKER: Swansea's a good town.
###2494 It's a good town.
###2495 It's a good town.
###2497 As long everybody gets on.
###2499 If you don't get on, well, you can't make it, can you?
###2503 I say there's enough room in the world for everybody, as
###2508 long as somebody gives some space.
###2510 CORNELIUS COLLINS: Hey, hey.
###2511 What's happening, boys?
###2513 
###2515 Oh, a lot of old bill about, isn't it?
###2517 Fucking filth everywhere, man.
###2519 Oh, they're doing a--
###2520 There's my old man, look!

###2522 That's his--
###2523 CORNELIUS COLLINS: Mr. Collins.
###2524 SEAN COLLINS: How's it going?
###2525 All right?
###2526 How's things?
###2527 CORNELIUS COLLINS: Remember this one, do ya?
###2528 SEAN COLLINS: Where's the bin?
###2529 CORNELIUS COLLINS: You all right, man?
###2531 Yeah?
###2532 SEAN COLLINS: Well, I went to that BNP thing, and I thought,
###2535 well, it's a load of fucking--
###2537 what's going on?
###2539 But we do need the jobs for our boys.
###2544 And most of them are illegal immigrants.
###2546 There's no black on the Union Jack.
###2550 There is no white on the Stars and Stripes.
###2553 AMY PROTHEROE: [INAUDIBLE].
###2554 CORNELIUS COLLINS: Oy, it'd be nice if we was working again,
###2556 Dad, wouldn't it?
###2557 SEAN COLLINS: Yeah.
###2557 Get him off the drugs.
###2559 AMY PROTHEROE: Oh, look what he bought me for my birthday.
###2561 CORNELIUS COLLINS: I'm trying to get back on The
###2562 Big Issue, I am.
###2562 SEAN COLLINS: I don't want them two to get married.
###2564 CORNELIUS COLLINS: Why?
###2565 SEAN COLLINS: Would you?
###2566 Too many--
###2567 CORNELIUS COLLINS: We're in love.
###2567 SEAN COLLINS: Yeah, right.
###2568 CORNELIUS COLLINS: We're in love.
###2569 SEAN COLLINS: I really don't want my son
###2570 to marry this girl.
###2571 CORNELIUS COLLINS: Come on, then.
###2573 SEAN COLLINS: She drags him down, man.
###2576 Since he's been with her, it's like he's
###2579 gone into the gutter.
###2580 She drags him down, man.
###2582 I don't know why he loves her.
###2584 Love is blind, so they say.
###2585 I don't know.
###2587 And it's a sad thing.
###2588 I'm really sorry for my son now.
###2591 I'm sorry for her, for what happened-- what
###2594 she said, you know?
###2595 That she was abused and that.
###2597 AMY PROTHEROE: He's not just my boyfriend.
###2599 He's my soulmate, my best friend, and he's
###2601 the love of my life.
###2602 SEAN COLLINS: I loves him.
###2604 He loves me.
###2605 I loves him.
###2606 He loves me.
###2607 AMY PROTHEROE: I loves him, too.
###2607 Sean, why don't we get on, darling?
###2611 SEAN COLLINS: What do you reckon?
###2612 AMY PROTHEROE: We do and we don't.
###2613 SEAN COLLINS: You're a bitch, man.
###2614 CORNELIUS COLLINS: Shut it, you, you cunt.
###2616 SEAN COLLINS: Well, you asked me why.
###2618 I'm telling the truth.
###2618 You are a bitch.
###2619 Eh?
###2620 You are a bitch, you know.
###2623 INTERVIEWER (OFFSCREEN): He pulled your hair out?
###2623 AMY PROTHEROE: Yeah.
###2624 And he smashed the phone up.
###2626 SEAN COLLINS (OFFSREEN): I did, yes.
###2626 I shouldn't have, but I did.
###2629 I am very sorry.
###2630 You know that, don't you?
###2631 CORNELIUS COLLINS: The Collins clan.
###2634 The Collins clan.
###2635 
###2639 CLINT RYAN JONES: Hello.
###2641 How are you?
###2642 INTERVIEWER (OFFSCREEN): How are you?
###2643 CLINT RYAN JONES: All right, thank you.
###2644 INTERVIEWER (OFFSCREEN): Good to see you.
###2645 CLINT RYAN JONES: I've cleaned up.
###2645 I'm clean.
###2646 INTERVIEWER (OFFSCREEN): You are?
###2646 CLINT RYAN JONES: Yeah, I'm clean.
###2648 I've sorted my head out since the last time you've seen me.
###2651 I went on a detox.
###2653 And then, that didn't work for me.
###2655 I relapsed.
###2657 And then they put me on a methadone program.
###2659 
###2664 Ah, that's better, isn't it?
###2665 I've come a long way since you last seen me, you know?
###2668 INTERVIEWER (OFFSCREEN): Yeah.
###2669 CLINT RYAN JONES: It's nice to see you fellows, anyway.
###2670 INTERVIEWER (OFFSCREEN): Yeah.
###2670 You too, man.
###2671 You too.
###2673 Positive mental attitude.
###2673 CLINT RYAN JONES: Yeah.
###2674 PMA.
###2674 INTERVIEWER (OFFSCREEN): Yeah.
###2675 CLINT RYAN JONES: It does work.
###2678 CLINT RYAN JONES (OFFSCREEN): I've really
###2679 improved and things.
###2680 I'm much happier.
###2681 Like, I want to go back to college and study social--
###2687 
###2689 is it care?
###2691 I'm saving up now for my daughter, for when I get to
###2695 see her, to give her a load of presents and things.
###2698 
###2701 Because I don't want to be dependent on methadone.
###2705 No, no way.
###2705 Liquid handcuffs, they call it.
###2708 That's what they call it-- liquid handcuffs, because
###2710 you've got to stay in the area to take that liquid every day
###2715 to stop you from being ill.
###2717 It's impossible.
###2717 It's every other door around here is selling it.
###2720 Or if they haven't got it, you know, it's only down around
###2722 the corner have got it.
###2723 You know, it's easy to get a hold of-- so easy
###2725 to get a hold of.
###2726 It is.
###2727 It's getting really worse.
###2728 It's getting terrible.
###2729 INTERVIEWER (OFFSCREEN): Why?
###2730 Because of the demand?
###2731 CLINT RYAN JONES: Well, It's not so much as that.
###2732 It's the money that's being made off it, you know?
###2736 People are making thousands upon thousands
###2738 of pounds off it.
###2740 I'm ashamed to say I used to sell it.
###2742 I used to make, easy, 1,500 pounds a day.
###2746 And I'd still be living like a scruff.
###2749 I'd do a snowball, as they call it--
###2751 mix heroin with crack and have one hell of a
###2755 fantastic head on.
###2757 But you've still got to wake up to the same shit the
###2761 following day, you know?
###2763 I've turned my life around now, and I've
###2765 sorted myself out.
###2766 And I wouldn't dare touch another bag of it in my life.
###2770 
###2793 CORNELIUS COLLINS: Hey, cat.
###2794 Guess what we done yesterday?
###2795 INTERVIEWER (OFFSCREEN): What happened yesterday?
###2796 CORNELIUS COLLINS: Lost our fucking money.
###2797 Amy gets paid on a Wednesday.
###2799 I get paid on Thursday.
###2800 
###2804 She's coming.
###2804 Said she had the car.
###2805 There she is.
###2805 There she is.
###2808 She's crying.
###2809 
###2813 CORNELIUS COLLINS: Amy, would you be nice and not hit me?
###2817 AMY PROTHEROE: [INAUDIBLE].
###2818 You poured cider all over my hair, man.
###2820 CORNELIUS COLLINS: What?
###2821 Why?
###2822 Amy, why?
###2823 Because you fucking--
###2824 AMY PROTHEROE: You fucked my mother.
###2825 CORNELIUS COLLINS: I didn't fuck your mother.
###2827 Amy.
###2827 AMY PROTHEROE: I'm homeless.
###2828 [INAUDIBLE].
###2831 Look what you've done.
###2832 CORNELIUS COLLINS: Look what I've done.
###2833 Hold on.
###2833 Right, Amy?
###2834 It's either do that, right, or hit you back?
###2837 What do you want me to do?
###2838 Do you want a punch?
###2839 Or do you want a fucking dribble of
###2841 cider chucked at you?
###2842 I'm not having it, Amy.
###2844 Amy, your mother and Fogey yesterday, right, told me and
###2849 you you're lucky I haven't fucking hit you.
###2851 That's what they said.
###2852 You're lucky you haven't had a fucking hiding.
###2854 Do you know if you weren't my girlfriend--
###2856 AMY PROTHEROE: You fucked my mother.
###2857 CORNELIUS COLLINS: Amy, fuck off, right?
###2858 AMY PROTHEROE: He's always abandoning me.
###2859 I've fucked my own mother.
###2861 Her lips are long, man.
###2863 Don't they sag down a bit?
###2864 CORNELIUS COLLINS (OFFSCREEN): I know you've fucked your own
###2865 mother, Amy.
###2866 You've told me, man.
###2867 AMY PROTHEROE: Don't they sag down a bit?
###2870 CORNELIUS COLLINS: Fuck off.
###2871 You knows I wouldn't shag your mother.
###2875 Would you risk shagging your girlfriend's mother when your
###2877 girlfriend's on the settee, you're out in the kitchen
###2879 looking for cider with your girlfriend's mother.
###2882 And her boyfriend--
###2883 no, her mother's boyfriend-- is upstairs, who's fucking
###2885 loopy, who's been to jail for kidnapping and smashing
###2887 people's toes off.
###2889 And he's fucking psycho to the max.
###2892 Would you risk shagging his missus
###2893 downstairs while he's upstairs?
###2895 Would you?
###2896 INTERVIEWER (OFFSCREEN): I wouldn't.
###2897 CORNELIUS COLLINS: Would you, Adam?
###2897 INTERVIEWER (OFFSCREEN): Mm-mm.
###2898 CORNELIUS COLLINS: Would do?
###2898 INTERVIEWER (OFFSCREEN): No.
###2899 CORNELIUS COLLINS: So fuck you.
###2900 I wouldn't neither.
###2901 You knows I don't like violence.
###2902 You knows I don't like fighting.
###2903 So am I gonna risk having my fucking hand
###2908 chopped off with an axe?
###2910 AMY PROTHEROE: [INAUDIBLE].
###2911 CORNELIUS COLLINS: Not my problem.
###2912 I'll give you one glass and that's it.
###2914 I'm not having you take a piss ut of me.
###2916 Telling me I shagged your fucking mother.
###2918 How are you so insecure?
###2919 AMY PROTHEROE: Corneil, I paid the money [INAUDIBLE].
###2921 CORNELIUS COLLINS: Why don't you go do a punter?
###2924 Quicker than begging, isn't it?
###2925 AMY PROTHEROE: I had to beg for the 17
###2926 pounds my mother robbed.
###2928 And I'm only allowed to have one.
###2929 Can I have the cider?
###2931 It's just gonna make me ill.
###2933 CORNELIUS COLLINS: Fucking fill your glass
###2934 up, and shut up.
###2935 You're being dopey.
###2936 AMY PROTHEROE: [INAUDIBLE].
###2937 CORNELIUS COLLINS: Oh, well fuck off then, if
###2938 you're gonna go.
###2939 I just don't know why you're being nasty.
###2942 AMY PROTHEROE: Fill it up, will you?
###2943 Fuck's sake.
###2944 CORNELIUS COLLINS: Look at the way you're talking.
###2945 Get off my-- hey.
###2946 Kick my glass on the floor.
###2948 Get all dirt all over it.
###2950 Thanks.
###2951 I'm in agony, right?
###2952 Yesterday, she punched me four times in the bollocks.
###2955 And she's fucked my other-- she's fucked my only decent
###2958 bollock up.
###2959 One's fucked already from 11 years ago, as she knows, and
###2963 she's gonna fucking punch me four times.
###2965 And I've got a pain in my stomach at the moment.
###2968 My bollocks are fucking killing.
###2970 AMY PROTHEROE (OFFSCREEN): You're fucking lying.
###2971 CORNELIUS COLLINS: I'm lying?
###2972 Right.
###2973 Did you know I had a fucking dodgy bollock, then?
###2975 AMY PROTHEROE (OFFSCREEN): Yeah.
###2976 CORNELIUS COLLINS: Was is much bigger than the other one?
###2977 AMY PROTHEROE (OFFSCREEN): Don't know.
###2978 CORNELIUS COLLINS: Fuck off.
###2979 You don't know.
###2980 AMY PROTHEROE: Why can't you give me some cider?
###2982 CORNELIUS COLLINS (OFFSREEN): I just gave you a glass.
###2984 AMY PROTHEROE: I want you to give me some more.
###2987 CORNELIUS COLLINS: All right, [INAUDIBLE], huh?
###2989 Are you going to knock it over?
###2991 AMY PROTHEROE: [INAUDIBLE].
###2993 
###2995 CORNELIUS COLLINS (OFFSREEN): Amy.
###2996 AMY PROTHEROE: [INAUDIBLE].
###2996 CORNELIUS COLLINS: What
###2997 AMY PROTHEROE (OFFSCREEN): [INAUDIBLE]
###2998 CORNELIUS COLLINS: Oh, phwor.
###3001 Poor little Amy.
###3002 
###3025 LEE DENNIS (OFFSCREEN): I feel a lot better in myself.
###3026 I mean I've been clean now a good few weeks.
###3029 There's a few boys on the bikes by here, look.
###3031 [ENGINES REVVING]
###3037 LEE DENNIS (OFFSCREEN): Little kids, eh?
###3038 Some mad times we used to have up here as kids--
###3041 setting cars on fire.
###3043 Good boy.
###3046 The rabbits and the hares and that-- many times we'd come up
###3048 here, early hours of the morning, and you could see
###3050 eyes running everywhere.
###3052 We used to try to chasing them in a stolen car and try
###3053 killing them and stuff you know what I mean?
###3055 Off our face, drunk and stuff, you know what I mean?
###3058 Many times, the farmer used to come out with his rice gun and
###3061 shoot us with his rice--
###3063 rice cartridges.
###3064 And they used to sting like hell, especially if they catch
###3067 you on the arse, like.
###3068 You know, I wish I'd stuck with the old crowd, instead of
###3072 all the heroin users and stuff.
###3073 Years ago, I could count a good few friends on my hand.
###3077 But now, they disowned me, type of thing, for the heroin.
###3079 If I'd known how bad heroin was, I wouldn't have tried it.
###3084 It's a bad drug.
###3085 It' a dirty drug.
###3086 But it's a nice drug as well.
###3089 It's a nice feeling off it.
###3091 Now, I wake up in the morning, I go down to get my methadone,
###3094 I drink my methadone, and I try to keep myself occupied
###3097 then by going over to my sister's or my mum's That I
###3100 made when I was in prison before.
###3102 INTERVIEWER (OFFSCREEN): You did?
###3102 LEE DENNIS: Yeah, Gypsy caravan out of matches.
###3105 Nodding head--
###3106 when I put my reggae on, his head rocks back and forth.
###3112 Drug testing kit that I done
###3114 yesterday, which is a negative.
###3116 They test you for heroin and crack cocaine.
###3119 And there's two lines--
###3120 negative.
###3121 Now I just want to be normal now, try and get myself a
###3124 decent job.
###3126 INTERVIEWER (OFFSCREEN): When you look back on
###3127 it, how do you feel?
###3128 LEE DENNIS: Tell you the truth, man, I
###3129 think I'm an asshole.
###3131 Put my family through so much shit and trouble.
###3134 Many a times, I said I've love to move away and that, but
###3136 really, I won't.
###3139 I don't know.
###3140 It's my hometown, and all my family are in Swansea.
###3142 
###3146 I don't think I've ever move away.
###3147 
###3156 AMY PROTHEROE: If I didn't have Corneil, I think I would
###3158 have killed myself by now.
###3159 He's what keeps me going.
###3159 You're my rock, aren't you?
###3161 CORNELIUS COLLINS: Oh, baby.
###3163 AMY PROTHEROE: He's my rock.
###3165 Well, we loves each other to bits, don't we?
###3167 CORNELIUS COLLINS: We do, yeah.
###3168 AMY PROTHEROE: Yeah.
###3168 CORNELIUS COLLINS: We love each other.
###3170 AMY PROTHEROE: We're engaged.
###3170 He got me an engagement ring for my
###3172 18th birthday, remember?
###3178 CORNELIUS COLLINS: Just found a bottle of wine.
###3180 
###3185 That is when I had Student of the Year award in Swansea
###3189 College, Tychoch College, for NVQ Level 1 business studies.
###3194 Or was it level 2?
###3196 I can't remember now.
###3197 Level 2, I think it was.
###3198 No, GNVQ Foundation Level 1.
###3201 And I look like I got lipstick on.
###3203 AMY PROTHEROE: He done a catering course, business
###3205 studies course.
###3206 CORNELIUS COLLINS: What's that say?
###3207 AMY PROTHEROE: Have you got fucking
###3208 lip balm on or something?
###3210 CORNELIUS COLLINS: Don't I look like I got lipstick on?
###3211 
###3214 I look weird, don't I, man?
###3217 AMY PROTHEROE: I love you.
###3220 See, look at that.
###3222 Look at all that--
###3222 all stale blood.
###3224 CORNELIUS COLLINS: See this bit here?
###3225 That was all up the wall.
###3227 It was a shit hole.
###3229 AMY PROTHEROE: Look at my pillow case.
###3230 [INAUDIBLE].
###3230 There's blood on it.
###3232 He got me all of my shampoos.
###3234 These shampoos-- he didn't get me cheap ones.
###3236 He got me that.
###3236 He got me perfume.
###3238 CORNELIUS COLLINS: Do you like that?
###3240 From Next, but I didn't actually have it in Next.
###3243 It was three or four quid in one of the charity shops.
###3248 AMY PROTHEROE: He bought me that.
###3249 I haven't worn it yet.
###3249 Look, al the tags are still on it.
###3251 CORNELIUS COLLINS (OFFSCREEN): Knickers
###3252 AMY PROTHEROE: My pajama set--
###3254 my Minnie Mouse.
###3255 I'd love to be pretty.
###3257 CORNELIUS COLLINS (OFFSCREEN): You are pretty.
###3259 AMY PROTHEROE: Me?
###3259 I looks like a fucking dog.
###3261 CORNELIUS COLLINS (OFFSCREEN): Shut up, twat.
###3262 AMY PROTHEROE: I'm fat.
###3263 Look at the size of me.
###3264 Look how fat I am.
###3266 CORNELIUS COLLINS: She's not fat, is she?
###3267 AMY PROTHEROE: Aren't I fat?
###3268 My ass is huge.
###3269 CORNELIUS COLLINS: You're more of a twat than fat.
###3272 [INAUDIBLE].
###3273 Turn around and show them your feet.
###3275 CORNELIUS COLLINS: No, I don't want to do that.
###3276 AMY PROTHEROE: Don't be a big baby.
###3277 Turn around.
###3278 If you love me, you will.
###3279 CORNELIUS COLLINS: Stop it.
###3280 AMY PROTHEROE: [INAUDIBLE].
###3282 Look, look.
###3283 They're not well, are they?
###3283 Lift your foot up.
###3284 CORNELIUS COLLINS: No way.
###3284 Stop it, man.
###3285 It's embarrassing.
###3286 AMY PROTHEROE: Please.
###3287 CORNELIUS COLLINS: The red's burning right there.
###3288 It's all burning.
###3289 AMY PROTHEROE (OFFSCREEN): He's been crying.
###3291 Every time he walks, it's like he's just been bum raped.
###3294 CORNELIUS COLLINS: It's called trench foot.
###3295 They used to get in the war.
###3297 Yeah, I bought the trainers.
###3298 Was it me that bought the trainers?
###3300 AMY PROTHEROE: Yeah.
###3300 CORNELIUS COLLINS: She woke up, and somebody had taken
###3302 them off her fucking feet, man.
###3303 AMY PROTHEROE: My little zebra.
###3305 What's he do now?
###3306 How do you do it?
###3307 [COWBOY-LIKE SHOUTING FROM TOY]
###3308 CORNELIUS COLLINS (OFFSCREEN): Woohoo.
###3309 
###3315 AMY PROTHEROE: My mother sent me to live
###3317 with this bloke, right?
###3318 He was 31 and I was 13.
###3320 He used to make me sleep with his friends and that.
###3323 They used to know what was going on.
###3324 They used to watch him beat me up.
###3325 And they used to watch him send me to the
###3327 bedroom with other men.
###3328 And my mother did nothing, because he used to give her 50
###3330 pounds' worth of heroin for free.
###3333 I had to have sex with my mother and
###3335 her partner as well.
###3337 So it hasn't been a really good life, but--
###3339 it's tough, isn't it?
###3340 CORNELIUS COLLINS (OFFSCREEN): Let's talk about
###3340 something else, Amy.
###3342 
###3344 AMY PROTHEROE: The first time his father ever hit me, his
###3346 father misplaced 20 pounds.
###3348 And we didn't have it.
###3349 I had my maternity grant.
###3351 I was six months pregnant.
###3352 His father threw me on the floor, ripped my hair out,
###3356 slapped me in the face, spat on my face, and within three
###3361 weeks, the baby died.

###3425 CLINT RYAN JONES: This is the one now, "Don't Do Drugs."
###3428 Some of my friends sang some of it.
###3432 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###3432 FEMALE SINGER (OFFSCREEN): I was sitting on a log And along
###3436 came a frog.
###3439 He said, do you want to smoke some pot?
###3444 I said, I'd rather not.
###3446 
###3449 He said he slung hash, come on and give me your cash.
###3458 You mean you want my money?
###3462 You must be trying to be funny.
###3467 I don't do drugs.
###3469 
###3472 CLINT RYAN JONES: I relapsed a fortnight ago.
###3475 So I went to put a needle in, and I missed.
###3477 And it went in to an abscess.
###3479 I've lost my wife, my three kids.
###3483 Now, all I want in life is to be a family and to be loved.
###3488 I've never been loved.
###3490 I've never had a mother or father that loved me.
###3493 Basically, I was abused.
###3495 Instead of having a cutch, I'd be fucking
###3497 punched around, you know?
###3499 But I am going to be the best daddy going when I get to the
###3504 stage I can say, fuck it.
###3507 I don't want no more.
###3510 That was me demonstrating on the very last fucking bag I'll
###3514 ever do in my whole entire life.
###3516 I missed a bit.
###3518 But there's the fucking hole it left me with, which isn't a
###3522 fucking pleasurable sight, as you can see.
###3526 Mums, dads, don't turn your back on your children.
###3532 Always be there.
###3534 Give them plenty of love and attention.
###3536 
###3541 Once chance you have of living.
###3543 Don't blow it.
