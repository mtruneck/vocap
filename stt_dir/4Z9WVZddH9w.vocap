###40 just because we have an excess supply of goods...

###67 Now, my grandmother was a wonderful person.
###70 She taught me how to play the game Monopoly.
###73 She understood that the name of the game is to acquire.
###77 She would accumulate everything she could
###79 and eventually, she became the master of the board.
###83 And then she would always say the same thing to me.
###85 She would look at me and she would say:
###87 “One day, you'll learn to play the game.”
###90 One summer, I played Monopoly almost every day, all day long.
###94 And that summer, I learned to play the game.
###97 I came to understand the only way to win
###99 is to make a total commitment to acquisition.
###102 I came to understand that money and possessions-
###104 that's the way that you keep score.
###108 And by the end of that summer, I was more ruthless than my grandmother.
###111 .
###111 I was ready to bend the rules if I had to, to win that game.
###115 And I sat down with her to play that fall.
###119 I took everything she had.
###120 I watched her give her last dollar and quit in utter defeat.
###126 And then she had one more thing to teach me.
###130 Then she said:
###134 “Now it all goes back in the box.
###140 All those houses and hotels.
###143 All the railroads and utility companies...
###145 All that property and all that wonderful money...
###150 Now it all goes back in the box.
###154 None of it was really yours.
###158 You got all heated up about it for a while.
###161 But it was around a long time before you sat down at the board
###165 and it will be here after you're gone: players come, players go.
###172 Houses and cars...
###175 Titles and clothes...
###177 Even your body.”
###180 Because the fact is that everything I clutch and consume and hoard
###184 is going to go back in the box and I'm going to lose it all.
###187 So you have to ask yourself
###189 when you finally get the ultimate promotion
###191 when you have made the ultimate purchase
###193 when you buy the ultimate home
###195 when you have stored up financial security
###197 and climbed the ladder of success
###199 to the highest rung you can possibly climb it...
###203 and the thrill wears off
###205 - and it will wear off -
###209 Then what?
###212 How far do you have to walk down that road
###214 before you see where it leads?
###219 Surely you understand
###222 it will never be enough.
###225 So you have to ask yourself the question:
###228 What matters?
###289 They're Hot!
###292 They're Rich!
###296 And They're Spoiled!

###355 When I was a young man
###357 growing up in New York City
###360 I refused to pledge allegiance to the flag.
###365 Of course I was sent to the principal's office.
###368 And he asked me, 'Why don't you want to pledge allegiance?
###371 Everybody does!'
###373 I said, 'Everybody once believed the Earth was flat
###376 but that doesn't make it so.'
###378 I explained that America owed everything it has
###381 to other cultures and other nations
###384 .
###384 and that I would rather pledge allegiance
###386 to the Earth and everyone on it.
###390 .
###390 Needless to say it wasn't long before I left school entirely
###395 .
###395 ...and I set up a lab in my bedroom.
###398 There I began to learn about science and nature.
###402 .
###402 I realized then that the universe is governed by laws
###406 .
###406 and that the human being, along with society itself,
###410 .
###410 was not exempt from these laws.
###413 Then came the crash of 1929
###416 which began what we now call
###419 “The Great Depression”.
###420 I found it difficult to understand why millions
###424 were out of work, homeless, starving,
###427 while all the factories were sitting there;
###430 the resources were unchanged.
###433 It was then that I realized
###435 that the rules of the economic game
###438 were inherently invalid.
###441 Shortly after, came World War II
###444 where various nations took turns
###446 systematically destroying each other.
###449 I later calculated that all the destruction
###452 and wasted resources spent on that war
###456 .
###456 could have easily provided for every
###458 human need on the planet.
###463 Since that time，I have watched humanity
###466 set the stage for its own extinction.
###470 I have watched as the precious finite resources
###473 are perpetually wasted and destroyed
###476 in the name of profit and free markets.
###479 I have watched the social values of society
###482 be reduced into a base artificiality of materialism
###487 and mindless consumption.
###489 And I have watched as the monetary powers
###493 control the political structure
###495 of supposedly free societies.
###499 I'm 94 years old now.
###502 And I'm afraid my disposition is the same as it was
###506 .
###506 75 years ago.
###510 This shit's got to go.
###520 [ ZEITGEIST ]
###525 [ ZEITGEIST: MOVING FORWARD ]
###540 [ Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful
###543 committed citizens can change the world.
###546 Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has. -Margaret Mead ]
###550 .
###550 [ Part 1: Human Nature ]
###553 So you're a scientist, and ...
###556 somewhere along the way, hammered into your head
###559 is the inevitable “nature versus nurture”
###562 and that's at least up there with Coke versus Pepsi
###565 or Greeks versus Trojans.
###567 So, nature versus nurture: This, by now
###570 utterly over-simplifying view of
###573 where influences are-
###575 influences on how a cell deals with
###580 an energy crisis up to
###582 what makes us who we are on the most individualistic
###585 levels of personality.
###588 And what you've got is this complete false dichotomy
###591 built around nature as deterministic
###594 at the very bottom of all the causality.
###597 Of 'life is DNA' and the 'code of codes'
###600 and the Holy Grail, and everything is driven by it.
###603 At the other end is a much more social science perspective
###606 .
###606 which is: We are 'social organisms'
###609 and biology is for slime molds;
###612 humans are free of biology.
###615 And obviously both views are nonsense.
###618 What you see instead is that
###620 it is virtually impossible to understand how biology works
###625 .
###625 outside of the context of environment.
###628 [ It's Genetic ]
###630 One of the most crazy making yet widespread
###635 .
###635 and potentially dangerous notions is:
###638 “Oh, that behavior is genetic.”
###642 Now what does that mean? It means all sorts of subtle stuff if you
###646 .
###646 know modern biology, but for most people out there
###649 what it winds up meaning is:
###651 a deterministic view of life,
###654 one rooted in biology and genetics.
###657 Genes equal things that can't be changed.
###660 Genes equal things that are
###663 inevitable and that you might as well
###665 not waste resources trying to fix,
###668 might as well not put societal energies into trying to improve
###671 because it's inevitable and it's unchangeable.
###674 And that is sheer nonsense.
###680 [ Disease ]
###683 It is widely thought that
###686 conditions like ADHD are genetically programmed,
###689 conditions like schizophrenia are genetically programmed.
###691 The truth is the opposite.  Nothing is genetically programmed.
###695 .
###695 There are very rare diseases, a small handful,
###698 .
###698 extremely sparsely represented in the population,
###702 that are truly genetically determined.
###706 Most complex conditions
###708 might have a predisposition that has a genetic component,
###712 but a predisposition is not the same as a predetermination.
###716 The whole search for the source of diseases in the genome
###720 was doomed to failure before anybody even thought of it,
###723 because most diseases are not genetically predetermined.
###727 Heart disease, cancer, strokes,
###731 rheumatoid conditions, autoimmune conditions in general,
###736 mental health conditions, addictions-
###738 none of them are genetically determined.
###741 Breast cancer, for example. Out of 100 women with breast cancer
###745 only seven will carry the breast cancer genes.
###748 93 do not.
###750 And out of 100 women who do have the genes
###752 not all of them will get cancer.
###757 [ Behavior ]
###759 Genes are not just things that make us behave in
###762 a particular way regardless of our environment.
###767 Genes give us different ways of responding to our environment.
###771 And in fact it looks as if some of the early
###775 childhood influences and the kind of child rearing,
###780 affect gene expression:
###781 actually turning on or off different genes
###784 to put you on a different developmental track
###788 which may suit the kind of world you've got to deal with.
###792 So for example,
###793 a study done in Montreal with suicide victims
###798 looked at autopsies of the brains of these people.
###801 And it turned out that if a suicide victim
###804 (these are usually young adults)
###806 had been abused as children, the abuse actually
###809 caused a genetic change in the brain
###812 that was absent in the brains of people who had not been abused.
###817 That's an epigenetic effect.
###818 “Epi” means on top of, so that
###821 the epigenetic influence is what happens
###825 environmentally to either activate or deactivate certain genes.
###831 In New Zealand, there was a study
###833 that was done in a town called Dunedin,
###836 in which a few thousand individuals
###841 were studied from birth into their 20s.
###845 What they found was that they could identify
###851 a genetic mutation- an abnormal gene-
###854 which did have some relation to
###857 the predisposition to commit violence,
###861 but only if the individual had also
###864 been subjected to severe child abuse.
###868 In other words, children with this abnormal gene
###871 would be no more likely to be violent than anybody else,
###874 and in fact, they actually had a lower rate of violence
###877 than people with normal genes
###879 as long as they weren't abused as children.
###883 Great additional example of the ways
###885 in which genes are not “be all - end all.”
###887 A fancy technique where you can
###889 take a specific gene out of a mouse,
###892 that mouse and its descendants will not have that gene.
###894 You have ”knocked out” that gene.
###896 So there's this one gene that encodes for a protein
###898 that has something to do with learning and memory.
###901 And with this fabulous demonstration you “knock out” that gene
###905 .
###905 and you have a mouse that doesn't learn as well.
###907 “Ooh! A genetic basis for intelligence!”
###910 What was much less appreciated in that landmark study
###913 that got picked up by the media left and right,
###916 is take those genetically impaired mice
###919 and raise them in a much more enriched
###921 stimulating environment than your normal mice in a lab cage,
###924 and they completely overcame that deficit.
###928 So, when one says in a contemporary sense that
###932 “Oh, this behavior is genetic”
###935 to the extent that that's even a valid sort of phrase to use,
###938 what you're saying is: there is a
###941 genetic contribution to how this organism responds to environment;
###945 .
###946 genes may influence the readiness with which
###950 an organism will deal with a certain environmental challenge.
###953 .
###953 You know, that's not the version most people have in their minds.
###956 And not to be too 'soap-boxing'
###959 but run with the old version of “It's genetic!” and
###964 .
###964 it's not that far from the history of Eugenics and things of that sort.
###969 .
###969 It's a widespread misconception
###971 and it's a potentially fairly dangerous one.
###974 One reason that the
###978 biological explanation for violence,
###980 one reason that hypothesis is potentially dangerous-
###984 it's not just misleading it can really do harm-
###987 .
###988 is because if you believe that, you could very easily say:
###992 .
###992 “Well, there's nothing we can do
###995 to change the predisposition people have to becoming violent.
###999 All we can do, if somebody becomes violent is
###1002 punish them- lock them up or execute them-
###1005 .
###1005 but we don't need to worry about changing the
###1008 social environment or the social preconditions
###1012 that may lead people to become violent
###1015 because that's irrelevant.”
###1018 The genetic argument allows us the luxury of ignoring
###1022 past and present historical and social factors.
###1025 And in the words of Louis Menand
###1028 who wrote in the New Yorker, very astutely he said:
###1031 .
###1031 “It's all in the genes, an explanation for the way things are
###1035 that does not threaten the way things are.
###1038 Why should someone feel unhappy or
###1041 engage in antisocial behavior when that person is living
###1044 .
###1045 in the freest and most prosperous nation on Earth?
###1048 It can't be the system.
###1050 There must be a flaw in the wiring somewhere.”
###1053 Which is a good way of putting it.
###1055 So, the genetic argument is simply a cop-out
###1059 which allows us to ignore
###1061 the social and economic and political factors
###1064 that, in fact, underlie many troublesome behaviors.
###1071 .
###1073 [ Case Study: Addiction ]
###1075 Addictions are usually considered to be a drug-related issue.
###1079 .
###1079 But looking at it more broadly, I define addiction as any behavior
###1084 .
###1084 that is associated with craving, with temporary relief
###1089 .
###1089 and with long-term negative consequences
###1091 along with an impairment of control over it, so that the person
###1094 wishes to give it up or promises to do so
###1098 but can't follow through.
###1100 And when you understand that, you see that
###1103 there are many more addictions than simply those related to drugs.
###1106 .
###1106 There's workaholism, addiction to shopping,
###1109 to the Internet; to video games.
###1110 There's the addiction to power. People that have power but
###1113 they want more and more; nothing is ever enough for them.
###1116 Acquisition - corporations that must own more and more.
###1120 The addiction to oil, or at least to the wealth
###1123 and to the products made accessible to us by oil.
###1127 .
###1127 Look at the negative consequences on the environment.
###1130 We are destroying the very earth that we inhabit
###1134 for the sake of that addiction. Now, these addictions
###1136 are far more devastating in their social consequences
###1139 .
###1139 than the cocaine or heroin habits of my downtown Eastside patients.
###1144 Yet, they are rewarded! And considered to be respectable.
###1148 The tobacco company executive that shows a higher profit
###1151 will get a much bigger reward.
###1154 He doesn't face any negative consequences legally or otherwise.
###1159 In fact he is a respected member
###1160 of the board of several other corporations.
###1164 But, tobacco smoke related diseases
###1167 kill 5 ½ million people around the world every year.
###1171 In the United States they kill 400,000 people a year.
###1175 And these people are addicted to what? To profit.
###1177 To such a degree that they are addicted
###1179 that they are actually in denial
###1182 about the impact of their activities
###1184 which is typical for addicts, is denial!
###1187 And that's a respectable one. It's respectable to be
###1190 addicted to profit, no matter what the cost.
###1192 So, what is acceptable and what is respectable
###1196 is a highly arbitrary phenomenon in our society.
###1199 And it seems like the greater the harm
###1201 the more respectable the addiction.
###1205 [ The Myth ]
###1207 There is a general myth that drugs, in themselves, are addictive.
###1210 In fact, the war on drugs is predicated on the idea
###1214 that if you interdict the source of drugs
###1216 you can deal with addiction that way.
###1218 Now, if you understand addiction in the broader sense
###1221 we see that nothing in itself is addictive.
###1224 No substance, no drug is by itself addictive
###1227 and no behavior is by itself addictive.
###1229 Many people can go shopping without becoming shopaholics.
###1232 Not everyone becomes a food addict.
###1234 Not everyone who drinks a glass of wine becomes an alcoholic.
###1237 So the real issue is: what makes people susceptible?
###1240 Because it's the combination of a susceptible individual
###1244 and the potentially addictive substance or behavior
###1247 that makes for the full flowering of addiction.
###1251 In short, it's not the drug that's addictive,
###1254 it's the question of the susceptibility of the individual
###1257 to being addicted to a particular substance or behavior.
###1260 [ Environment ]
###1262 If we wish to understand what then
###1264 makes some people susceptible
###1266 we actually have to look at the life experience.
###1268 The old idea- although it's old but it's still
###1274 broadly held- that addictions are due to some genetic cause
###1277 is simply scientifically untenable.
###1280 What the case is actually is that
###1282 certain life experiences make people susceptible.
###1285 Life experiences that not only shape the person's
###1289 personality and psychological needs
###1293 but also their very brains in certain ways.
###1296 And that process begins in utero.
###1301 [ Prenatal ]
###1303 It has been shown, for example,
###1304 that if you stress mothers during pregnancy
###1308 their children are more likely to have traits
###1310 that predispose them to addictions.
###1313 And that's because development is shaped
###1315 by the psychological and social environment.
###1317 So the biology of human beings is very much affected by
###1320 and programmed by the life experiences beginning in utero.
###1326 Environment does not begin at birth.
###1328 Environment begins as soon as you have an environment.
###1331 As soon as you are a fetus, you are subject to
###1334 whatever information is coming through mom's circulations.
###1337 Hormones, levels of nutrients...
###1339 A great landmark example of this is
###1341 something called the Dutch Hongerwinter.
###1344 In 1944, Nazis occupying Holland
###1348 for a bunch of reasons, they decide to take all the food
###1350 and divert it to Germany;
###1352 for three months everybody there was starving.
###1354 Tens of thousands of people starve to death.
###1356 What the Dutch hunger winter effect is:
###1358 if you were a second or third trimester fetus during the starvation
###1363 your body 'learned' something very unique during that time.
###1367 As it turns out, second and third trimester is when
###1370 your body is going about trying to learn about the environment:
###1373 How menacing of a place is it out there?
###1377 How plentiful? How much nutrients am I getting
###1380 by way of mom's circulation?
###1382 Be a fetus who was starving during that time and
###1385 your body programs forever after to be
###1389 really, really stingy with your sugar and fat
###1393 and what you do is you store every bit of it.
###1396 Be a Dutch Hunger Winter fetus and half a century later,
###1400 everything else being equal, you are more likely to have
###1403 .
###1403 high blood pressure, obesity or metabolic syndrome.
###1406 That is environment coming in a very unexpected place.
###1410 You can stress animals in the laboratory when they're pregnant
###1414 and their offspring will be more likely to use
###1416 cocaine and alcohol as adults.
###1418 You can stress human mothers. For example, in a British study
###1422 women who were abused in pregnancy
###1424 will have higher levels of the
###1426 stress hormone cortisol in their placenta at birth
###1429 and their children are more likely to have conditions
###1432 that predispose them to addictions by age 7 or 8.
###1435 So in utero stress already prepares the gun
###1438 for all kinds of mental health issues.
###1440 An Israeli study done on children
###1444 born to mothers who were pregnant
###1447 prior to the onset of the 1967 war...
###1452 These women, of course, were very stressed
###1454 and their offspring have a higher incidence of schizophrenia
###1456 than the average cohort.
###1458 So, there is plenty of evidence now that prenatal effects
###1462 have a huge impact on the developing human being.
###1468 [ Infancy ]
###1470 The point about human development and specifically
###1472 human brain development is that it occurs mostly
###1474 under the impact of the environment and mostly after birth.
###1477 .
###1477 Now, if you compare us to a horse
###1479 which can run on the first day of life
###1481 we see that we are very undeveloped.
###1485 We can't muster that much neurological coordination
###1489 balance, muscle strength, visual acuity
###1492 until a year and a half, two years of age.
###1494 That's because the brain development in the horse
###1496 happens in the safety of the womb
###1498 and in the human being, it has to happen after birth,
###1501 and that has to do with simple evolutionary logic.
###1504 As the head gets larger, which is what makes us into human beings-
###1507 the burgeoning of the forebrain
###1510 is what creates the human species, actually.
###1513 At the same time we walk on two legs, so our pelvis narrows
###1516 to accommodate that. So now we have a narrower pelvis, a larger head- ...
###1520 .
###1520 Bingo! We have to be born prematurely.
###1522 And that means the brain development that in other animals
###1525 occurs in utero, in us, occurs after birth
###1528 .
###1528 and much of that under the impact of the environment.
###1532 The concept of Neural Darwinism simply means
###1535 that the circuits that get the appropriate input from the environment
###1538 will develop optimally and the ones that don't
###1541 will either not develop optimally or perhaps not at all.
###1543 If you take a child with perfectly good eyes at birth
###1546 and you put him in a dark room for five years
###1548 he will be blind thereafter for the rest of his life
###1551 because the circuits of vision require light waves for their development,
###1555 and without that even the rudimentary circuits
###1558 present and active at birth
###1560 will atrophy and die and new ones will not develop.
###1565 [ Memory ]
###1567 There is a significant way in which
###1570 early experiences shape adult behavior,
###1575 and even and especially
###1578 early experiences for which there is no recall memory.
###1581 It turns out that there are two kinds of memory:
###1584 there is explicit memory which is recall;
###1586 this is when you can call back facts,
###1589 details, episodes, circumstances.
###1592 But the structure in the brain which is called the hippocampus
###1595 which encodes recall memory
###1597 doesn't even begin to develop fully until a year and a half
###1600 and it is not fully developed until much later.
###1602 Which is why hardly anybody has any recall memory
###1605 prior to 18 months.
###1607 But there is another kind of memory which is called implicit memory
###1609 .
###1609 which is in fact, an emotional memory
###1612 where the emotional impact and the interpretation the child makes
###1616 of those emotional experiences are ingrained in the brain
###1619 in the form of nerve circuits ready to fire without specific recall.
###1623 .
###1623 So to give you a clear example, people who are adopted
###1626 .
###1626 have a lifelong sense of rejection very often.
###1629 They can't recall the adoption.
###1631 They can't recall the separation of the birth mother
###1633 because there's nothing there to recall with.
###1635 But the emotional memory of separation and rejection
###1638 is deeply embedded in their brains.
###1641 Hence, they are much more likely to experience a sense of rejection
###1644 .
###1644 and a great emotional upset
###1646 when they perceive themselves as being rejected by other people.
###1650 .
###1650 That's not unique to people who are adopted
###1652 but it is particularly strong in them
###1653 because of this function of implicit memory.
###1656 People who are addicted, given ...
###1659 all the research literature and in my experience,
###1662 the hard-core addicts virtually were all
###1667 significantly abused as children
###1669 or suffered severe emotional loss.
###1671 Their emotional or implicit memories
###1674 are those of a world that's not safe
###1677 and not helpful, caregivers who were not to be trusted
###1680 and relationships that are not
###1684 safe enough to open up to vulnerably.
###1686 And hence their responses tend to be
###1687 to keep themselves separate from really intimate relationships;
###1692 .
###1692 not to trust caregivers, doctors
###1694 and other people who are trying to help them
###1697 and generally see the world as an unsafe place.
###1700 And that is strictly a function of implicit memory
###1704 which sometimes has to do with incidents they don't even recall.
###1712 [ Touch ]
###1714 Infants who are born premature are often in incubators
###1717 and various types of gadgetry and machinery
###1719 for weeks and perhaps months.
###1722 It's now known that if these children
###1724 are touched and stroked on the back for just 10 minutes a day,
###1727 that promotes their brain development.
###1729 So, human touch is essential for development
###1732 and in fact, infants who are never picked up will actually die.
###1736 That is how much of a fundamental need
###1739 being held is to human beings.
###1741 In our society, there is an unfortunate tendency
###1744 to tell parents not to pick up their kids, not to hold them,
###1747 not to pick up babies who are crying for fear of spoiling them or
###1752 to encourage them to sleep through the night- you don't pick them up-
###1756 .
###1756 which is just the opposite of what the child needs.
###1758 And these children might go back to sleep because they give up
###1762 and their brains just shut down as a way of
###1765 defending against the vulnerability
###1767 of being abandoned really by their parents.
###1770 But their implicit memories will be
###1772 that of the world that doesn't give a damn.
###1775 [ Childhood ]
###1777 A lot of these differences are structured very early in life.
###1783 In a way, the parental experience of adversity-
###1788 how tough life is or how easy it is- is passed on to children
###1792 .
###1792 whether through maternal depression
###1795 or parents being bad tempered with their kids because they have
###1798 .
###1798 had a hard day or just being too tired at the end of the day.
###1802 And these have very powerful effects
###1805 programming children's development, which we know a lot about now.
###1809 But that early sensitivity isn't just an evolutionary mistake.
###1814 It exists again in many different species.
###1817 Even in seedlings, there's an early adaptive process
###1820 to the kind of environment they are growing up in.
###1822 But for humans, the adaptation is to the quality of social relations.
###1828 And so, early life:
###1831 how nurturing, how much conflict, how much attention you get-
###1836 is a taster of the kind of world you may be growing up in.
###1840 Are you growing up in a world where you have to
###1842 fight for what you can get, watch your back,
###1844 fend for yourself, learn not to trust others?
###1847 Or are you growing up in a society where you depend on
###1850 reciprocity, mutuality, cooperation, where empathy is important,
###1855 where your security depends on good relations with other people?
###1859 And that needs a very different emotional and cognitive development.
###1863 .
###1863 And that's what the early sensitivity is about.
###1866 And parenting is almost- quite unconsciously-
###1870 a system for passing on that experience to children,
###1874 of the kind of world they are in.
###1876 The great British child psychiatrist, D.W. Winnicott, said
###1880 that fundamentally, two things can go wrong in childhood.
###1883 One is when things happen that shouldn't happen
###1886 and then things that should happen but don't.
###1889 In the first category, is the traumatic and abusive
###1893 and abandonment experiences of my
###1896 downtown Eastside patients and of many addicts.
###1899 That's what shouldn't happen but did.
###1902 But then there is the non-stressed, attuned,
###1906 non-distracted attention of the parent that every child needs
###1911 .
###1911 that very often children don't get.
###1913 They're not abused. They are not neglected
###1915 and they're not traumatized.
###1918 But what should happen-
###1919 the presence of the emotionally available nurturing parent-
###1922 just is not available to them because
###1924 of the stresses in our society and the parenting environment.
###1928 The psychologist Allan Schore calls that "Proximal Abandonment"
###1934 when the parent is physically present but emotionally absent.
###1939 .
###1940 I have spent
###1943 roughly the last 40 years of my life
###1947 working with the most violent of people our society produces:
###1952 murderers, rapists and so on.
###1954 In an attempt to understand what causes this violence,
###1958 I discovered that the most violent of the criminals in our prisons
###1962 had themselves been victims
###1965 of a degree of child abuse that was beyond the scale
###1968 of what I ever thought of applying the term child abuse to.
###1971 I had no idea of the depth
###1974 of the depravity with which children in our society
###1978 are all too often treated.
###1981 The most violent people I saw were themselves the survivors
###1984 of their own attempted murder often at the hands of their
###1987 parents or other people in their social environment
###1991 or were the survivors of family members who had been killed-
###1994 their closest family members- by other people.
###1999 The Buddha argued that everything depends on everything else.
###2003 He says 'The one contains the many and the many contains the one.'
###2006 That you can't understand anything in isolation from its environment.
###2010 The leaf contains the sun, the sky and the earth, obviously.
###2018 This has now been shown to be true, of course all around
###2021 and specifically when it comes to human development.
###2024 The modern scientific term for it
###2027 is the "bio-psycho-social" nature of human development
###2029 which says that the biology of human beings
###2032 depends very much on their interaction with
###2034 the social and psychological environment.
###2036 And specifically, the psychiatrist and researcher
###2042 Daniel Siegel at the University of California, Los Angeles, UCLA
###2046 has coined a phrase “Interpersonal Neurobiology”
###2050 which means to say that the way that our nervous system functions
###2054 depends very much on our personal relationships:
###2057 in the first place with the parenting caregivers,
###2060 and in the second place with other important
###2062 attachment figures in our lives
###2063 and in the third place, with our entire culture.
###2066 So that you can't separate the
###2068 neurological functioning of a human being
###2071 from the environment in which he or she grew up in
###2075 and continues to exist in.
###2077 And this is true throughout the life cycle.
###2080 It's particularly true when you are
###2082 dependent and helpless when your brain is developing
###2084 but it's true even in adults and even at the end of life.
###2091 [ Culture ]
###2093 Human beings have lived in almost every kind of society,
###2096 from the most egalitarian-
###2099 hunting and gathering societies seem to have been very egalitarian-
###2103 for instance based on food sharing, gift exchange...
###2106 Small bands of people living
###2109 predominately off of foraging and a little bit of hunting,
###2113 predominantly among people you have
###2115 at the least, known your entire life
###2117 if not surrounded by third cousins or closer,
###2120 in a world in which there is a great deal
###2122 of fluidity between different groups,
###2124 in a world which there is not
###2125 a whole lot in terms of material culture...
###2128 this is how humans have spent most of their hominid history.
###2131 And, no surprise, that makes for a very different world.
###2134 One of the things you get as a result of that is far less violence.
###2138 Organized group violence is
###2141 not something that occurred at that time
###2143 of human history and that seems quite clear.
###2146 So where did we go wrong?
###2150 Violence is not universal. It is not symmetrically distributed
###2156 throughout the human race. There is a huge variation
###2160 in the amount of violence in different societies.
###2163 There are some societies that have virtually no violence.
###2167 There are others that destroy themselves!
###2170 Some of the Anabaptist religious groups
###2176 that are complete strict pacifists
###2178 like the Amish, the Mennonites, the Hutterites...
###2181 Among some of these groups, the Hutterites-
###2184 there are no recorded cases of homicide.
###2189 During our major wars, like World War II
###2193 where people were being drafted
###2194 they would refuse to serve in the military.
###2196 They would go to prison rather than serve in the military.
###2200 In the Kibbutzim in Israel
###2202 the level of violence is so low that the criminal courts there
###2205 will often send violent offenders
###2208 -people who have committed crimes-
###2211 to live on the Kibbutzim in order to
###2214 learn how to live a non-violent life.
###2216 Because that's the way people live there.
###2218 So, we are amply shaped by society.
###2222 Our societies, in the broader sense, including our theological,
###2227 our metaphysical, our linguistic influences, etc.,
###2231 our societies help shape us as to whether or not we think
###2234 life is basically about sin or about beauty;
###2238 whether the afterlife will carry a price
###2240 for how we live our lives or if it's irrelevant.
###2243 In a broad sort of way, different large societies
###2247 could be termed as individualistic or collectivist, and
###2250 you get very different people and different mindsets and
###2253 .
###2253 I suspect different brains coming along with that.
###2255 We, in America, are in one of the most individualistic of societies,
###2261 with capitalism being a system that allows you to go
###2263 higher and higher up a potential pyramid and
###2267 the deal is that it comes with fewer and fewer safety nets.
###2270 By definition, the more stratified a society is,
###2274 the fewer people you have as peers; the fewer people with whom
###2277 you have symmetrical, reciprocal relationships
###2280 and instead, all you have are differing spots and endless hierarchies.
###2285 A world in which you have few reciprocal partners
###2289 is a world with a lot less altruism.
###2294 [Human Nature]
###2297 So, this brings us to a total impossible juncture which is
###2302 to try to make sense in perspective science
###2305 as to what that nature is of human nature.
###2308 You know, on a certain level
###2310 the nature of our nature is not to be
###2313 particularly constrained by our nature.
###2316 We come up with more social
###2317 variability than any species out there.
###2320 More systems of belief, of styles, of family structures,
###2324 of ways of raising children. The capacity
###2327 for variety that we have is extraordinary.
###2332 In a society which is predicated on competition
###2335 and really, very often, the ruthless exploitation
###2341 of one human being by another-
###2343 the profiteering off of other people's problems
###2346 and very often the creation of problems
###2348 for the purpose of profiteering-
###2351 the ruling ideology will very often justify that behavior
###2354 by appeals to some fundamental and unalterable human nature.
###2359 So the myth in our society
###2360 is that people are competitive by nature
###2362 and that they are individualistic and that they're selfish.
###2367 The real reality is quite the opposite.
###2370 We have certain human needs.
###2371 The only way that you can talk about human nature concretely
###2374 is by recognizing that there are certain human needs.
###2377 We have a human need for companionship and for close contact,
###2380 to be loved, to be attached to, to be accepted,
###2383 to be seen, to be received for who we are.
###2387 If those needs are met, we develop
###2390 into people who are compassionate and cooperative and
###2396 who have empathy for other people.
###2398 So...
###2401 the opposite, that we often see in our society,
###2403 is in fact, a distortion of human nature
###2405 precisely because so few people have their needs met.
###2409 So, yes you can talk about human nature
###2411 but only in the sense of basic human needs
###2414 that are instinctively evoked
###2416 or I should say, certain human needs
###2418 that lead to certain traits if they are met
###2421 and a different set of traits if they are denied.
###2427 So...
###2428 when we recognize the fact that the human organism,
###2431 which has a great deal of adaptive flexibility
###2434 allowing us to survive in many different conditions,
###2437 is also rigidly programmed for certain environmental requirements
###2442 or human needs,
###2444 a social imperative begins to emerge.
###2447 Just as our bodies require physical nutrients,
###2450 the human brain demands positive forms of environmental stimulus
###2455 at all stages of development,
###2457 while also needing to be protected
###2459 from other negative forms of stimulus.
###2463 And if things that should happen, do not...
###2465 or if things that shouldn't happen, do...
###2468 it is now apparent that the door can be opened for not only
###2471 a cascade of mental and physical diseases
###2474 but many detrimental human behaviors as well.
###2478 So, as we turn our perspective now outward
###2481 and take account for the state of affairs today,
###2483 we must ask the question:
###2486 Is the condition we have created in the modern world
###2488 actually supporting our health?
###2491 Is the bedrock of our socioeconomic system
###2495 acting as a positive force
###2496 for human and social development and progress?
###2500 Or, is the foundational gravitation of our society
###2504 actually going against the core evolutionary requirements
###2508 needed to create and maintain
###2511 our personal and social well-being?
###2531 [Part II: Social Pathology]
###2537 So, one might ask where did this all begin?
###2541 what we have today... really a world in a state of
###2544 cumulative collapse.
###2547 [The Market]
###2550 You get it started with John Locke.
###2553 And John Locke introduces property.
###2556 He has three provisos for just private right and property.
###2560 And the three provisos are:
###2563 There must be enough left over for others
###2565 and that you must not let it spoil
###2567 and that you, most of all, must mix your labor with it.
###2571 It seems justified- you mix your labor with the world
###2574 then you are entitled to the product.
###2576 And as long as there's enough left over for others
###2579 and as long as it doesn't spoil
###2581 and you don't allow anything to go to waste then that's okay.
###2584 He spends a long time on his famous Treatises of Government
###2587 and it's since been the canonical text
###2590 for economic and political and legal understanding.
###2593 It is still the classic text that's studied.
###2596 Well, ... after he gives the provisos
###2600 and you're almost thinking at the time
###2601 whether you are for private property or not-
###2603 he has given a very good and plausible and powerful defense
###2608 of private property here-
###2609 Well, he drops them!
###2611 He drops them like that. Right in one sentence.
###2613 He says, 'Well, once the introduction
###2615 of money came in by men's tacit consent..." then it became-
###2620 .
###2620 and he doesn't say all the provisos are canceled or erased-
###2623 but that's what happens.
###2626 So, now we have not
###2628 product and your property earned by your own labor-
###2630 oh no- money buys labor now.
###2633 There is no longer consideration
###2635 whether there is enough left over for others;
###2637 there is no longer consideration of whether it spoils-
###2640 because he says money is like silver and gold and gold can't spoil-
###2643 .
###2643 and therefore money can't be responsible for waste...
###2647 which is ridiculous. We are not talking about money and silver,
###2650 we are talking about what its effects are.
###2651 It's one non sequitur after another.
###2654 Just the most startling
###2657 logical legerdemain that he gets away with here.
###2661 But it fits the interests of capital owners.
###2666 Then Adam Smith comes along
###2668 and what he adds is the religion to this...
###2670 Locke started with 'God made it all this way- this is God's right...'
###2674 .
###2674 and now we get also with Smith saying 'it's not only God's...'
###2679 .
###2679 well, he's not actually saying this but this is
###2680 what's happening philosophically, in principle-
###2683 he's saying that 'it is not only a question of private property...'
###2686 That's all now 'presupposed'- It's Given!
###2689 And that there's 'money investors that buy labor' – Given!
###2691 There's no limit to how much they can buy of other men's labor,
###2695 how much they can accumulate, how much 'inequality'-
###2697 that's all given now.
###2699 And so he comes along and what his big idea is-
###2702 and again it's just introduced in parentheses, in passing...
###2707 You know, when people put out goods for sale- ... the supply-
###2712 and other people buy them- the demand and so forth,
###2715 how do we have supply equaling demand or demand equaling supply?
###2721 .
###2721 How can they come into equilibrium?
###2723 And that is one of the central notions of economics,
###2725 is how do they come into equilibrium.
###2728 And he says: it's the “Invisible Hand of the Market”
###2732 that brings them into equilibrium.
###2734 So, now we have "God is actually imminent”.
###2737 He just didn't give the rights to property
###2740 and all its wherewithal and its "natural rights"
###2745 regarding what Locke said...
###2747 now we have the system itself AS "God".
###2751 In fact, Smith says, when he talks
###2754 and you'll never find this quote, and you have to read the whole of
###2757 the Inquiry into the Wealth of Nations to find it.
###2759 He says: 'the scantiness of subsistence
###2762 sets limits to the reproduction of the poor
###2766 and that nature can deal with this in no other way
###2771 than elimination of their children.'
###2774 So he anticipated evolutionary theory in the worst sense...
###2779 this is well before Darwin.
###2780 And so he called them the 'Race of Laborers'.
###2783 So you can see: there was inherent racism built in here,
###2787 there was an inherent life blindness to kill innumerable children.
###2794 .
###2794 And he thought: 'That's the Invisible Hand making supply
###2797 meet demand and demand meet supply.'
###2800 So, see- how wise "God" is?
###2803 So you can see a lot of the really virulent
###2806 life destructive, eco-genocidal things
###2810 that are going on now have, in a way,
###2814 a 'thought gene' back in Smith too.
###2820 When we reflect on the original concept of
###2822 the so-called free market capitalist system
###2825 as initiated by early economic philosophers
###2828 such as Adam Smith
###2829 we see that the original intent of a “market”
###2832 was based around real, tangible, life supporting goods for trade.
###2837 Adam Smith never fathomed that the most
###2839 profitable economic sector on the planet
###2842 would eventually be in the arena of financial trading
###2845 or so-called investment, where money itself is simply
###2848 ,
###2848 gained by the movement of other money in an arbitrary game
###2851 .
###2852 which holds zero productive merit to society.
###2855 Yet, regardless of Smith's intent
###2858 the door for such seemingly anomalous advents
###2860 was left wide open by one fundamental tenet of this theory:
###2865 Money is treated as a Commodity, in and of itself.
###2870 Today, in every economy of the world
###2872 regardless of the social system they claim
###2874 money is pursued for the sake of money and nothing else.
###2878 The underlying idea, which was mysteriously qualified
###2881 by Adam Smith with his religious declaration of the 'Invisible Hand'
###2887 .
###2887 is that the narrow, self-interested pursuit
###2890 of this fictional commodity will somehow
###2893 .
###2893 magically manifest human and social well-being and progress.
###2898 The reality is that the monetary incentive 'interest'
###2902 or what some have termed the "Money Sequence of Value”
###2906 has now completely decoupled from the foundational
###2909 'life interest', which could be termed the
###2912 "Life Sequence of Value".
###2914 What has happened is that there is a complete confusion
###2918 in economic doctrine between those two sequences.
###2922 .
###2922 They think that the Money Sequence of Value
###2924 delivers the Life Sequence of Value.
###2927 And that's why they say if more goods are sold,
###2929 if GDPs rise and so forth...
###2931 there would be more enhanced well-being
###2934 and we could take the GDP as being our basic layer indicator
###2938 .
###2938 of social health. Well, there you see the confusion.
###2941 It's talking about Money Sequences of Value-
###2943 that is, all the receipts and all the revenues
###2945 that are derived from selling goods-
###2948 and they're confusing that with life reproduction.
###2951 So, you have built right into this thing from the beginning
###2955 a complete conflation of the money
###2958 and life sequences of value. So,
###2960 we are dealing with a kind of structured delusion
###2964 which becomes more and more deadly
###2966 as the money sequence decouples from producing
###2969 anything at all. So it's a system disorder.
###2973 .
###2973 And the system disorder seems to be fatal.
###2978 [Welcome to the Machine]
###2981 In society today, you seldom hear anyone speak
###2984 of the progress of their country or society
###2987 in terms of their physical well-being, state of happiness,
###2991 trust or social stability.
###2993 Rather, the measures are presented to us
###2995 through economic abstractions.
###2997 We have the gross domestic product, the consumer price index,
###3001 the value of the stock market, rates of inflation,
###3004 and so on.
###3005 But does this tell us anything of real value
###3008 as to the quality of peoples' lives?
###3011 No. All of these measures have to do with
###3013 the money sequence itself and nothing more.
###3017 For example, the Gross Domestic Product of a country
###3020 is a measure of the value of goods and services sold.
###3023 This measure is claimed to correlate to the
###3026 “standard of living” of a country's people.
###3029 In the United States health care accounted
###3031 for over 17% of GDP in 2009
###3035 amounting to over $2.5 trillion spent,
###3038 hence creating a positive effect on this economic measure.
###3041 And, based on this logic it would be even better for the US economy
###3045 .
###3045 if health care services increased more so...
###3048 perhaps to $3 trillion or 5 trillion,
###3051 since that would create more growth,
###3053 more jobs and hence boasted by economists
###3055 as a rise in their country's standard of living.
###3059 But- ... wait a minute.
###3060 What do health care services actually represent?
###3064 Well, SICK AND DYING PEOPLE.
###3067 That's right: the more unhealthy people there are in America
###3071 the better the economy.
###3073 Now, that is not an exaggeration or a cynical perspective.
###3077 In fact, if we step back far enough you will realize that the GDP
###3081 .
###3081 not only doesn't reflect real public or social health
###3084 on any tangible level,
###3085 it is, in fact, mostly a measure
###3088 of industrial inefficiency and social degradation.
###3092 .
###3092 And the more you see it rise, the worse things are becoming
###3095 with respect to personal, social
###3098 and environmental integrity.
###3100 You have to create problems to create profit.
###3104 There is no profit under the current paradigm
###3107 in saving lives, putting balance on this planet,
###3110 having justice and peace or anything else.
###3113 There is just no profit there.
###3116 There's an old saying: 'Pass a law and create a business.'
###3120 .
###3120 Whether you are creating a business for a lawyer or whatever.
###3122 So, crime does create business
###3125 just like destruction creates business in Haiti.
###3128 .
###3128 We have now roughly 2 million people incarcerated
###3132 in this country (USA)
###3133 and of those many are in prisons run by private corporations:
###3137 .
###3137 Corrections Corporation of America, Wackenhut,
###3139 who trade their stock on Wall Street
###3141 based upon how many people are in jail.
###3144 Now that's sickness!
###3146 But that is a reflection
###3148 of what this economic paradigm calls for.
###3152 So what exactly does this economic paradigm call for?
###3155 What is it that keeps our economic system going?
###3159 Consumption.
###3160 Or more accurately- Cyclical Consumption.
###3164 When we break down the foundation of classic market economics
###3167 .
###3167 we are left with a pattern of monetary exchange
###3170 that simply cannot be allowed to stop
###3172 or even substantially slowed
###3174 if the society as we know it is to remain operational.
###3178 .
###3178 There are three main actors on the economic stage:
###3181 the employee, the employer and the consumer.
###3184 .
###3184 The employee sells labor to the employer for income.
###3188 The employer sells its production services and hence goods,
###3191 to the consumer for income.
###3193 And the consumer, of course, is simply another role
###3195 of the employer and employee,
###3197 spending back into the system
###3199 to enable the cyclical consumption to continue.
###3202 In other words, the global market system is based
###3205 on the assumption that there will always be enough
###3207 product demand in a society to move enough money around
###3211 .
###3211 at a rate which can keep the consumption process going.
###3215 And the faster the rate of consumption
###3216 the more so-called economic growth is assumed
###3219 and so the machine goes...
###3222 But, hold on-
###3223 I thought an economy was meant to, I don't know...
###3226 “Economize”?
###3228 Doesn't the very term have to do with preservation
###3231 and efficiency and a reduction of waste?
###3234 So how does our system, which demands consumption
###3238 and the more the better, efficiently preserve
###3240 or “Economize” at all?
###3243 Well... it doesn't.
###3245 The intent of the market system is, in fact, the exact opposite
###3248 of what a real economy is supposed to do,
###3251 which is efficiently and conservatively
###3253 orient the materials for production and distribution
###3255 of life supporting goods.
###3258 We live on a finite planet, with finite resources
###3261 where, for example, the oil we utilize
###3263 took millions of years to develop...
###3265 where the minerals we use took billions of years to develop.
###3269 So...having a system that deliberately promotes
###3273 the acceleration of consumption
###3275 for the sake of so-called “economic growth”
###3278 is pure ecocidal insanity.
###3282 Absence of waste, that's what efficiency is.
###3285 Absence of waste?
###3287 This system is more wasteful than all the other
###3290 existing systems in the history of the planet.
###3292 Every level of life organization and life system
###3295 is in a state of crisis and challenge
###3298 and decay or collapse.
###3300 No peer-reviewed journal in the last 30 years
###3303 will tell you anything different:
###3305 that is that every life system is in decline
###3309 as well as social programs... as well as our water access.
###3313 .
###3313 Try to name any means of life that isn't threatened and endangered.
###3317 .
###3317 You can't.
###3319 There really isn't one and that's very, very despairing.
###3321 But we haven't even figured out the causal mechanism.
###3324 We don't want to face the causal mechanism.
###3326 We just want to go on. You know that's where insanity is
###3329 where you keep doing the same thing over and over again
###3332 even though it clearly doesn't work.
###3335 So you're really
###3337 dealing with not an economic system
###3339 but I would go so far as to say an anti-economic system.
###3344 [The Anti-Economy]
###3347 There is an old saying that the competitive market model seeks to
###3351 .
###3351 “create the best possible goods at the lowest possible prices”.
###3355 This statement is essentially the incentive concept
###3358 which justifies market competition, based on the assumption
###3362 .
###3362 that the result is the production of higher quality goods.
###3366 If I was going to build myself a table from scratch
###3369 I would naturally build it out of the best
###3371 most durable materials possible, right?
###3373 With the intent for it to last as long as possible.
###3376 Why would I want to make something poor
###3378 knowing I would have to eventually do it again
###3380 and expend more materials and more energy?
###3384 Well, as rational as that may seem in the physical world,
###3388 when it comes to the market world
###3389 it is not only explicitly irrational
###3392 it is not even an option.
###3394 It is technically impossible to produce the best of anything
###3397 .
###3397 if a company is to maintain a competitive edge
###3400 and hence remain affordable to the consumer.
###3403 Literally everything created and set for sale
###3405 in the global economy is immediately inferior
###3408 the moment it is produced,
###3410 for it is a mathematical impossibility
###3413 to make the most scientifically advanced
###3415 efficient and strategically sustainable products.
###3419 This is due to the fact that the market system
###3421 requires that “cost efficiency”
###3423 or the need to reduce expenses
###3425 exists at every stage of production.
###3428 From the cost of labor, to the cost of
###3430 materials and packaging and so on.
###3432 This competitive strategy, of course,
###3435 is to make sure the public buys their goods
###3438 rather than from a competing producer
###3440 ...which is doing the exact same thing
###3442 to also make their goods both competitive and affordable.
###3447 This immutably wasteful consequence of the system
###3450 could be termed "Intrinsic Obsolescence".
###3454 However, this is only one part of a larger problem.
###3457 A fundamental governing principle of market economics,
###3460 one you will not find in any textbook by the way, is the following:
###3465 .
###3465 “Nothing produced can be allowed to maintain a lifespan longer
###3469 than what can be endured in order to continue cyclical consumption.”
###3473 .
###3473 In other words, it is critical that stuff break down,
###3476 fail and expire within a certain amount of time.
###3480 This is termed - “Planned obsolescence”.
###3484 Planned obsolescence is the backbone of the underlying market strategy
###3487 of every goods producing corporation in existence.
###3491 While very few, of course would admit to such a strategy outright
###3494 .
###3494 what they do is mask it within the
###3496 Intrinsic Obsolescence phenomenon just discussed,
###3500 while often ignoring, or even suppressing new advents in technology
###3504 .
###3504 which might create a more sustainable, durable good.
###3508 So, if it wasn't wasteful enough
###3510 that the system inherently cannot allow
###3513 the most durable and efficient goods to be produced,
###3516 Planned Obsolescence deliberately recognizes
###3519 that the longer any good is in operation
###3521 the worse it is for sustaining cyclical consumption
###3524 and hence the market system itself.
###3527 In other words, product sustainability
###3530 is actually inverse to economic growth
###3533 and hence there is a direct, reinforced incentive
###3537 to make sure life spans are short of any given good produced.
###3541 .
###3541 And, in fact, the system cannot operate any other way.
###3546 One glance at the sea of landfills now spreading across the world
###3550 show the obsolescence reality.
###3552 There are now billions of cheaply made cell phones,
###3555 computers and other technology
###3557 each full of precious, difficult to mine materials
###3560 such as gold, coltan, copper,
###3562 now rotting in vast piles
###3564 usually due to the mere malfunction or obsolescence
###3567 of small parts which, in a conservative society
###3571 could likely be fixed or updated and the life of the good extended.
###3575 .
###3575 Unfortunately, as efficient as that may seem in our physical reality
###3579 living on a finite planet with finite resources,
###3583 .
###3583 it is explicitly inefficient with respect to the market.
###3588 To put it into a phrase:
###3589 “Efficiency, Sustainability, and Preservation
###3592 are the enemies of our economic system.”
###3596 Likewise, just as physical goods need to be constantly produced
###3599 and reproduced regardless of their environmental impact,
###3603 .
###3603 the service industry operates with an equal rationale.
###3607 The fact is, there is no monetary benefit
###3610 to resolving any problems
###3612 which are currently being serviced.
###3614 At the end of the day
###3616 the last thing the medical establishment really wants
###3619 is the curing of diseases such as cancer,
###3622 which would eliminate countless jobs and trillions in revenue.
###3627 And since we are on the subject,
###3628 crime and terrorism in this system are good!
###3632 Well, at least economically.
###3634 For it is employing police,
###3636 generating high-value commodities for security,
###3638 not to mention the value of prisons
###3640 that are privately owned- for profit.
###3643 And how about war?
###3645 The war industry in America is a huge driver of GDP-
###3649 one of the most profitable industries-
###3651 producing weapons of death and destruction.
###3655 The favorite game of this industry is to blow things up
###3658 and then go and rebuild them! For profit.
###3661 We saw this with the windfall billion dollar contracts
###3664 made from the Iraq war.
###3666 The bottom line is that socially negative attributes of society
###3670 .
###3670 have become positively rewarded ventures for industry.
###3674 And any interest in problem resolution
###3676 or environmental sustainability and conservation
###3680 is intrinsically counter to economic sustainability.
###3685 And this is why
###3687 every time you see the GDP rise in any country
###3690 you are witnessing an increase in necessity
###3693 whether real or contrived.
###3695 And by definition, a necessity is rooted in inefficiency.
###3699 Hence, increased necessity means increased inefficiency.
###3704 [ Value System Disorder ]
###3707 The American dream is based on rampant consumerism.
###3710 .
###3710 It is based upon the fact that
###3713 mainstream media and
###3714 especially commercial advertising-
###3717 all corporations who need this infinite growth-
###3720 have convinced us or brainwashed
###3722 most people in America and hence the world
###3726 that we have to have X number of material possessions
###3728 and the possibility of gaining infinitely more
###3731 material possessions, in order to be happy.
###3734 That's just not true.
###3735 So why do people continue to buy in this way
###3739 which is ultimately eco-genocidal
###3742 in its systemic effects cumulatively?
###3744 And it just is classical operand conditioning.
###3747 You simply put inputs of conditioning into the organism
###3752 and you have outputs of desired behaviors
###3755 or goals or objectives.
###3758 And it has all the resources of technology.
###3761 And they boast about how they get into the minds of infants;
###3764 .
###3764 what they hear is already making them
###3767 conditioned to the brand.
###3769 Then you see, that's how people have been such fools.
###3773 .
###3773 In a way, they have been taught to be fools.
###3775 It's a value system disorder.
###3779 You know, if there is any testament
###3781 to the plasticity of the human mind;
###3783 if there is any proof to how malleable
###3785 human thought is and how easily conditioned
###3788 and guided people can become
###3790 based on the nature of their environmental stimulus
###3792 and what it reinforces:
###3794 the world of commercial advertising is the proof.
###3798 You have to stand in awe
###3801 at the level of brainwashing
###3803 where these programmed robots known as "consumers"
###3807 wander the landscape
###3809 only to walk into a store and spend, say-
###3812 $4000 on a handbag
###3815 that likely cost $10 to make
###3817 in a sweatshop overseas.
###3820 Only for the brand status it supposedly represents
###3824 in the culture.
###3825 Or perhaps the ancient communal traditions
###3828 which increase trust and cohesiveness in society-
###3832 which have now been hijacked
###3833 by acquisitive, materialistic values where now annually
###3837 we exchange useless crap a few times a year.
###3841 And we might wonder why so many today
###3843 have a compulsion to shopping and acquisition,
###3846 when it is clear that they have been conditioned from childhood
###3849 to expect material goods
###3851 as a sign of their status with friends and family.
###3855 The fact is, the foundation of any society
###3858 are the values that support its operation.
###3860 And our society, as it exists
###3862 can only operate if our values support
###3865 the conspicuous consumption
###3867 it requires to continue the market system.
###3871 75 years ago consumption in America
###3874 and much of the first world was half
###3876 of what we see today, per person.
###3878 Today's new consumer culture
###3880 has been manufactured and imposed
###3883 due to the very real need
###3885 for higher and higher levels of consumption.
###3888 And this is why most corporations now spend
###3891 more money on advertising
###3893 than the actual process of product creation itself.
###3897 They work diligently to create a false need for you to fill.
###3901 And it happens to work.
###3905 [ The “Economists” ]
###3907 You know economists, in fact, are not economists at all.
###3911 They're propagandists of money value.
###3914 And you will find that all of their models basically
###3916 get down to token exchanges that are true to profit
###3921 .
###3921 of one side or both sides or whatever.
###3923 But they are completely disconnected from the actually
###3926 existing world of reproduction.
###3928 In Ohio, an old man failed to pay his electric bill;
###3932 you may be familiar with the case.
###3934 And the electric company turned off the electricity and he died.
###3938 The reason they turned it off was because
###3939 it wouldn't have been profitable for them
###3941 to keep it on because he didn't pay his bill.
###3944 Do you believe that was right?
###3946 The responsibility really lies not on
###3948 the electric company for turning it off
###3950 but on those of this man's neighbors and friends and associates
###3955 .
###3955 who were not charitable enough to enable him, as an individual
###3958 .
###3958 to meet the electric bill.
###3961 HMMMMMM...
###3962 Did I hear that right?
###3964 Did he just say the death of a man caused by not having money
###3967 .
###3967 was the responsibility of...
###3969 other people...
###3971 or, in effect, charity?
###3973 Well then, I guess we're gonna need a whole lot of infomercials,
###3977 little miserable coin slot donations for bodega counters
###3981 .
###3981 and a bunch of pickle jars
###3983 for the billion people now starving to death on this planet
###3987 .
###3987 because of the very system Milton Friedman promotes.
###3992 Whether you are dealing with the philosophies of Milton Friedman,
###3995 F.A. Hyack, John Maynard Keynes, Ludwig von Mises
###3999 .
###3999 or any other major market economist
###4001 the basis of rationale rarely leaves the money sequence.
###4006 .
###4006 It is like a religion.
###4007 Consumption analysis, stabilization policies,
###4010 deficit spending, aggregate demand...
###4013 it exists as a never ending, self-referring
###4016 self-rationalizing circle of discourse
###4019 where universal human need, natural resources
###4023 and any form of physical life supporting efficiency
###4026 is ruled out by default,
###4028 and replaced by the singular notion that humans
###4031 seeking advantage over each other for money alone,
###4034 motivated by their own, narrow self-interest,
###4037 will magically create a sustainable, healthy, balanced society.
###4042 There is no life coordinate in this whole theory, this whole doctrine.
###4046 .
###4046 What are they doing? What are they doing??
###4049 What they are doing is tracking the money sequences.
###4052 That's all it is, is tracking money sequences
###4055 presupposing everything that matters:
###4058 One: There is no life coordinates...
###4061 Whoa- ... no life coordinates!
###4063 Two: That all the agents are self-maximizing preferences seekers.
###4069 .
###4069 That is, they think of nothing other than themselves
###4071 and what they can get most for themselves.
###4073 That's the ruling notion of rationality: self-maximizing choice.
###4079 .
###4079 And the only thing that they are interested in self-maximizing
###4082 is money or commodities.
###4085 Well, where does social relations come in?
###4087 It doesn't, except in the exchange to self-maximize.
###4091 Where do our natural resources come in?
###4093 They don't, except to exploit.
###4096 Where does the family come in as being able to survive?
###4101 It doesn't. They have to have money in order to purchase any good.
###4106 .
###4106 Well, shouldn't an economy deal somewhere with human need?
###4109 .
###4109 Isn't that what the fundamental issue is: to satisfy human needs?
###4115 .
###4115 Oh, "need" isn't even in your lexicon.
###4118 You dissolve it into "wants".
###4121 And what is a want? That means money demand that wants to buy.
###4125 .
###4125 Well, if it's money demand that wants to buy
###4128 it has nothing to do with need
###4129 because maybe the person has no money demand
###4132 and desperately needs, say, water supply.
###4135 Or, it may be money demand wants a gold toilet seat.
###4139 Well, where does it all go? To the gold toilet seat.
###4142 .
###4142 And you call this economics?
###4145 Really, when one thinks of it, it's got to be the most bizarre
###4149 .
###4150 delusion in the history of human thought!
###4154 [ Monetary System ]
###4156 Now- so far we have focused on the market system.
###4160 But this system is actually only half of the global economic paradigm.
###4164 .
###4164 The other half is the “Monetary System”.
###4168 While the Market System deals with the interaction of people
###4171 gaming for profit across the spectrum of labor,
###4174 production and distribution,
###4176 the Monetary System is an underlying set of policies
###4179 set by financial institutions
###4181 which create conditions for the market system, among other things.
###4186 .
###4186 It includes terms we often hear
###4188 such as interest rates, loans, debt,
###4191 the money supply, inflation, etc.
###4194 And while you might want to pull your hair out listening
###4197 to the gibberish coming from the monetary economists:
###4200 "Modest preemptive actions, can obviate the need
###4204 of more drastic actions, at a later date."
###4207 ... the nature and effect of this system
###4210 is actually quite simple:
###4212 Our economy has- or the global economy has-
###4216 .
###4216 three basic things that govern it. One is fractional reserve banking:
###4219 .
###4219 the banks printing money out of nothing.
###4221 [2nd] It's also based upon compound interest.
###4224 When you borrow money, you have to pay back more
###4227 than you borrowed which means that you, in effect,
###4230 create money out of thin air,
###4233 again which has to be serviced by creating still more money.
###4236 [3rd] We live in an infinite growth paradigm.
###4239 The economic paradigm we live in now is a Ponzi scheme.
###4243 Nothing grows forever. It's not possible.
###4246 .
###4246 As a great psychologist James Hillman wrote:
###4249 “The only thing that grows in the human body
###4251 after a certain age is cancer.”
###4253 It's not just the amount of money that has to keep growing
###4256 it's the amount of consumers. Consumers to
###4258 borrow money at interest to generate more money and obviously,
###4261 .
###4261 that's not possible on a finite planet.
###4264 People are basically vehicles to just create money,
###4268 which must create more money
###4270 to keep the whole thing from falling apart,
###4272 which is what's happening right now.
###4275 There are really only two things anyone needs to know
###4277 about the monetary system:
###4280 1: All money is created out of debt.
###4283 Money is monetized debt
###4285 whether it materialized from treasury bonds,
###4288 home loan contracts or credit cards.
###4291 In other words, if all outstanding debt
###4293 was to be repaid right now
###4295 there would not be one dollar in circulation.
###4298 And 2: Interest is charged on virtually all loans made,
###4303 and the money needed to pay back this interest
###4306 does not exist in the money supply outright.
###4309 Only the principal is created by the loans
###4312 and the principal is the money supply.
###4314 So, if all this debt was to be repaid right now,
###4317 not only would there not be one dollar left in circulation,
###4320 there would be a gigantic amount of money owed
###4324 that is literally impossible to pay back, for it does not exist.
###4330 The consequence of all of this is that two things are inevitable:
###4334 Inflation and Bankruptcy.
###4337 .
###4338 As far as inflation, this can be seen as a historical trend
###4341 in virtually every country today,
###4343 and easily tied to its cause,
###4345 which is the perpetual increase of the money supply
###4348 which is required to cover the interest charges
###4351 and keep the system going.
###4354 As far as Bankruptcy,
###4355 it comes in the form of debt collapse.
###4359 This collapse will inevitably occur with a person,
###4362 a business or a country
###4364 and typically happens when the interest payments
###4366 are no longer possible to make.
###4370 But there is a bright side to all of this...
###4372 well, at least in terms of the market system.
###4376 Because debt creates pressure.
###4378 Debt creates wage slaves.
###4381 A person in debt is much more likely to take a low wage
###4384 than a person who isn't,
###4385 hence becoming a cheap commodity.
###4388 So it's great for corporations to have a pool of people
###4390 that have no financial mobility.
###4393 But hey - that same idea also goes for entire countries.
###4398 The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund,
###4401 which mostly serve as proxies for transnational corporate interests,
###4405 .
###4405 give gigantic loans to troubled countries
###4408 at very high interest rates. And then,
###4410 once the countries are deeply in the hole and can't pay,
###4413 .
###4413 austerity measures are applied, the corporations swoop in,
###4417 .
###4417 set up sweatshops and take their natural resources.
###4421 Now that's market efficiency.
###4425 But wait – there's more:
###4426 You see, there's this unique hybrid
###4428 of the monetary and market system
###4430 called the stock market.
###4432 Which rather than, you know, actually produce anything real,
###4436 they just buy and sell money itself.
###4439 And when it comes to debt, you know what they do?
###4442 That's right- they trade it!
###4445 They actually buy and sell debt for profit.
###4449 From credit default swaps and
###4450 collateralized debt obligations for consumer debt,
###4454 to complex derivative schemes used
###4456 to mask the debt of entire countries,
###4459 .
###4459 such as the collusion of investment bank Goldman Sachs and Greece,
###4462 which nearly collapsed the entire European economy.
###4466 So when it comes to the stock market and Wall Street,
###4469 we have an entirely new level of insanity
###4472 born out of the Money Sequence of Value.
###4475 All you need to know about markets
###4477 was written in an editorial in the Wall Street Journal
###4480 a couple years ago. It was called
###4482 "Lessons of the Brain-Damaged Investor".
###4485 And in this editorial, they explained why
###4488 people with slight brain damage do better as investors
###4491 .
###4492 than people with normal brain functionality.
###4494 Why? Because the slightly
###4496 brain-damaged person has no empathy.
###4499 That's the key. If you don't have any empathy
###4502 you do well as an investor.
###4504 And so Wall Street breeds people who have no empathy.
###4509 To go in there and to make decisions
###4511 and to make trades they have no compunction about
###4514 and no thought whatsoever as to how what they are doing
###4517 might affect their fellow human being.
###4519 So they breed these robots.
###4521 These people who have no souls.
###4524 And since they don't even want to pay these people anymore-
###4527 they are now breeding robots – real robots –
###4529 real algorithmic traders.
###4531 Goldman Sachs in the high frequency trading scandal:
###4533 They put a computer next to the New York Stock Exchange.
###4537 This computer, this “co-located” computer, as they call it:
###4540 it front-runs all the trades on the exchange and
###4543 hits the exchange with volumes of orders
###4545 in ways that "scalp"
###4547 pennies and nickels away from the exchange.
###4549 It's like they're siphoning money all day long.
###4552 They went one quarter last year
###4554 30 or 60 straight days without a single down day
###4557 and made millions of dollars every single day?
###4560 That's statistically impossible!
###4564 When I worked on Wall Street, the way it works is
###4566 everyone kicks upstairs to bribes.
###4568 The brokers bribe to the office manager,
###4571 the office manager bribes to the regional sales manager,
###4575 the regional sales manager
###4576 bribes to the national sales manager.
###4578 It's a common understanding.
###4580 At Christmas, who gets the biggest bonus at Christmas
###4583 in an average broker job? The compliance officer.
###4586 The compliance officer sits there all day long; he's supposed
###4588 to be making sure you don't violate any of the margin rules
###4591 .
###4591 and you're "complying" with the law.
###4594 Of course, yeah, to the extent that
###4596 you can bribe the compliance officer-
###4598 yeah, that's right, you are complying with the law!
###4600 So how has fraud become the system?
###4603 It's no longer a byproduct.
###4604 It is the system.
###4606 It's like that old Woody Allen joke. He says:
###4609 “Doctor, my brother thinks he's a chicken.”
###4611 And the doctor says, “Take a pill
###4613 and that should cure the problem.”
###4615 And he says, “No doctor. You don't understand.
###4617 We need the eggs.”
###4618 Okay? So ...
###4620 the trading of fraudulent claims back and forth
###4623 between banks, to generate fees, to generate bonuses,
###4627 .
###4627 .
###4627 has become the GDP-producing
###4632 growth engine of the United States economy-
###4633 even though they are essentially trading fraudulent claims
###4637 that there is absolutely no hope of ever paying back.
###4639 They are processing, generating and re-securitizing nothing.
###4642 If I write $20 billion on a cocktail napkin
###4645 and I sell it to J.P. Morgan and J.P. Morgan writes
###4648 $20 billion on a cocktail napkin
###4651 and we swap those two cocktail napkins at a bar,
###4654 and we each pay ourselves a quarter of 1% in a fee,
###4657 we make a lot of money for our Christmas bonus.
###4659 We each have on our books a $20 billion cocktail napkin
###4663 which has no real value, until such time as
###4667 the system is no longer able to absorb
###4670 bogus cocktail napkins, in which case we go to the government
###4672 to get bailed out.
###4675 And because of Wall Street and the global stock market
###4677 there are now conservatively about 700 trillion dollars
###4681 of outstanding fraudulent claims,
###4683 known as derivatives,
###4685 still waiting to collapse.
###4687 A value amounting to over
###4689 10 times the gross domestic product
###4691 of the entire planet.
###4694 And while we have seen the bailouts of
###4696 corporations and banks by governments,
###4698 which, of course, comically borrow their money
###4700 from banks to begin with,
###4702 we are now seeing attempts to bailout whole countries
###4705 by conglomerates of other countries
###4708 through the International banks.
###4710 But how do you bailout a planet?
###4714 There is no country out there that isn't now saturated in debt.
###4718 The cascade of sovereign debt defaults we have seen
###4721 can only be the beginning, when the math is taken into account.
###4726 It has been estimated in the United States alone
###4729 that income tax would need to be raised to  65% per person
###4733 just to cover the interest in the near future.
###4737 Economists are now foreshadowing that within a few decades
###4740 60% of the countries on the planet will be bankrupt.
###4745 But hold on-- Let me get this straight.
###4749 The world is going "bankrupt"
###4752 whatever the hell that means
###4753 because of this idea called "debt"
###4756 which doesn't even exist in the physical reality.
###4759 It's only part of a game we've invented...
###4762 and yet the well being of billions of people
###4765 is now being compromised.
###4767 Extreme layoffs, tent cities, accelerating poverty,
###4772 austerity measures imposed, schools shutting down,
###4775 child hunger and other levels of familial deprivation- ...
###4780 all because of this elaborate fiction...
###4784 What are we, fucking stupid?!
###4788 Hey! Hey! Mars- my man!
###4790 Help a brother out, uh?
###4795 Grow up, kid!
###4804 Saturn! What's up man?
###4806 You remember that smokin' nebula I hooked you up with
###4808 a while back?
###4811 Uh- listen Earth.
###4813 We're getting really tired of you.
###4815 You've been given everything and yet you waste it all.
###4818 You've got plenty of resources and you know it.
###4821 Why don't you grow up and learn some responsibility for Christ's sake!
###4824 .
###4824 You're making your mother miserable.
###4832 You're on your own, pal.
###4834 Yeah, whatever.
###4842 [ Public Health ]
###4845 Now, all of this considered
###4847 from the waste machine known as the market system
###4850 to the debt machine known as the monetary system-
###4853 hence creating the monetary-market paradigm
###4857 which defines the global economy today-
###4860 there is one consequence that runs through
###4863 the entire machine:
###4865 Inequality.
###4867 Whether it is the market system which creates
###4870 a natural gravitation towards monopoly and power consolidation
###4874 while also generating pockets of wealthy industries
###4877 that tower over others regardless of utility-
###4881 .
###4882 such as the fact that top hedge fund managers on Wall Street
###4885 .
###4885 now take home over $300 million a year
###4889 for contributing literally nothing,
###4891 while a scientist looking for a cure for a disease
###4895 trying to help humanity
###4897 might make $60,000 a year if they're lucky-
###4901 or whether it is the monetary system,
###4903 which has class division built right into its structure.
###4907 For example: If I have $1 million to spare
###4910 .
###4910 and I put it into a CD at 4% interest,
###4913 I will make $40,000 a year.
###4915 No social contribution- no nothing.
###4919 However, if I'm a lower class person and have to take loans
###4922 to buy my car or home,
###4924 I am paying in interest which in abstraction
###4927 .
###4927 is going to pay that millionaire with the 4% CD.
###4931 This stealing from the poor to pay the rich
###4934 is a foundational, built-in aspect of the monetary system
###4938 and it could be labeled “Structural Classism”.
###4943 Of course, historically, social stratification
###4946 has always been deemed unfair, but obviously accepted overall,
###4950 .
###4950 as now 1% of the population owns 40% of the planet's wealth.
###4955 But material fairness aside
###4958 there is something else going on underneath the surface of inequality
###4961 .
###4961 causing an incredible deterioration in public health as a whole.
###4966 Well, I think people often are puzzled by the contrast
###4970 between the material success of our societies
###4973 - unprecedented levels of wealth -
###4976 and the many social failings.
###4979 If you look at the rates of
###4982 drug abuse or violence or self-harm
###4984 amongst kids or mental illness
###4987 there is clearly something going deeply wrong
###4991 with our societies.
###4992 The data I have been describing
###4996 simply shows that intuition that
###5000 people have had for hundreds of years:
###5001 that inequality is divisive and socially corrosive.
###5004 But that intuition is truer than I think we ever imagined.
###5008 There are very powerful psychological and social effects
###5012 of inequality. More to do I suppose with feelings
###5015 of superiority and inferiority.
###5018 That kind of division...
###5020 Maybe going with the respect or disrespect;
###5023 people feeling looked down on at the bottom.
###5026 Which, by the way, is why violence is
###5027 more common in more unequal societies-
###5030 the trigger to violence is so often people feeling
###5033 looked down upon and disrespected.
###5035 If there is one principle I could emphasize
###5039 that is, the most important principle
###5044 underlying the prevention of violence
###5047 it would be “Equality”.
###5050 The single most significant factor that affects the rate of violence
###5053 .
###5053 is the degree of equality versus the degree of inequality
###5057 in that society.
###5060 So, what we're looking at is a sort of
###5062 general social dysfunction.
###5065 It's not just one or two things that go wrong
###5067 as inequality increases.
###5069 It seems to be everything, whether we are talking about
###5071 crime or health or mental illness or whatever.
###5074 One of the really disturbing findings out there in public health is:
###5079 Never ever make the mistake of being poor.
###5083 Or being born poor.
###5084 Your health pays for it in endless sorts of ways:
###5087 something known as the 'health socioeconomic gradient'.
###5091 As you move down from the highest strata in society
###5094 in terms of socioeconomic status, every step down,
###5098 health gets worse for umpteen different diseases.
###5101 .
###5101 Life expectancy gets worse.
###5103 Infant mortality rate- everything you could look at.
###5106 .
###5106 So, a huge issue has been:
###5109 why is it that this gradient exists?
###5112 A totally simple obvious answer which is
###5114 'If you're chronically sick, you're not going to be very productive
###5117 .
###5117 so health causes drive socioeconomic differences.'
###5121 Not that in the slightest- on the very simple level that
###5124 .
###5124 you could look at the socioeconomic status of a 10-year-old
###5128 .
###5128 and that's going to predict something about their health decades later.
###5131 .
###5131 So, that's the direction of causality.
###5133 Next one- ... 'Oh, it's perfectly obvious:
###5137 poor people can't afford to go to the doctor; it's healthcare access.'
###5140 .
###5140 It's got nothing to do with that, because you see these same gradients
###5144 .
###5144 in countries with universal health care and socialized medicine.
###5147 .
###5147 Okay – next 'simple explanation':
###5149 'Oh -on the average- the poorer you are the more likely you are to
###5153 .
###5153 smoke, to drink and all sorts of lifestyle risk factors.'
###5158 Yeah, those contribute but careful studies have shown
###5161 that it explains maybe about a third of the variability.
###5164 So what's left?
###5166 What's left is having a ton to do with the stress of poverty.
###5171 .
###5171 So, the poorer you are- starting off being
###5175 the person who is one dollar of income behind Bill Gates-
###5178 the poorer you are in this country
###5179 on the average, the worse your health is.
###5181 This tells us something really important:
###5184 the health connection with poverty
###5186 it's not about being poor, it's about feeling poor.
###5190 Increasingly we recognize that
###5194 chronic stress is an important influence on health.
###5198 But the most important sources of stress
###5200 are the quality of social relations.
###5203 And if there is anything that lowers the quality of social relations,
###5207 .
###5207 it is the socioeconomic stratification of society.
###5211 What science has now shown is that regardless of material wealth
###5215 .
###5215 the stress of simply living in a stratified society
###5219 leads to a vast spectrum of public health problems.
###5222 And the greater the inequality, the worse they become.
###5227 Life expectancy: longer in more equal countries.
###5231 Drug Abuse: Less in more equal countries.
###5235 Mental Illness: Less in more equal countries.
###5240 Social Capital - meaning the ability of people to trust each other:
###5244 .
###5244 Naturally greater in more equal countries.
###5247 Educational Scores: Higher in more equal countries.
###5252 Homicide rates: less in more equal countries.
###5257 Crime and Rates of Imprisonment: Less in more equal countries.
###5261 .
###5262 It goes on and on:
###5264 Infant mortality – obesity - teen birth rate:
###5268 Less in more equal countries.
###5269 and perhaps most interesting:
###5272 Innovation: Greater in more equal countries.
###5276 which challenges the age old notion that a competitive
###5279 stratified society is somehow more creative and inventive.
###5284 Moreover, a study done in the UK called The WhiteHall Study
###5288 .
###5288 confirmed that there is a social distribution of disease
###5291 as you go from the top of the socioeconomic ladder to the bottom.
###5295 .
###5295 For example, it was found that the lowest rungs of the hierarchy
###5298 had a 4-fold increase of heart disease based mortality
###5302 .
###5302 compared to the highest rungs.
###5304 And this pattern exists, irrespective of access to health care.
###5309 Hence, the worse a person's relative financial status,
###5312 the worse their health is going to be on average.
###5315 This phenomenon is rooted in what could be termed
###5319 'Psychosocial Stress'
###5321 and it is at the foundation of the greatest social distortions
###5324 plaguing our society today.
###5326 Its cause?
###5328 The Monetary-Market System.
###5331 Make no mistake:
###5333 The greatest destroyer of ecology,
###5336 the greatest source of waste, depletion and pollution,
###5340 the greatest purveyor of violence-
###5342 war - crime - poverty - animal abuse and inhumanity,
###5347 the greatest generator of social and personal neurosis,
###5350 mental disorders - depression, anxiety,
###5354 not to mention, the greatest source of social paralysis
###5358 stopping us from moving into new methodologies
###5361 for personal health, global sustainability
###5364 and progress on this planet-
###5367 is not some corrupt government or legislation,
###5370 not some rogue corporation or banking cartel,
###5374 not some flaw of human nature,
###5377 and not some secret hidden cabal that controls the world.
###5382 .
###5382 It is, in fact: The Socio-Economic System itself
###5386 at its very foundation.
###5406 [ Part 3: Project Earth ]
###5410 Let's imagine for a moment we had the option
###5413 to redesign human civilization from the ground up.
###5416 What if- hypothetically speaking-
###5418 we discovered an exact replica of the planet Earth
###5421 and the only difference between this new planet and our current one
###5424 .
###5424 is that human evolution had not occurred. It was an open palette.
###5428 .
###5428 No countries, no cities, no pollution, no republicans...
###5432 just a pristine, open environment.
###5435 So- what would we do?
###5437 Well, first we need a “goal”, right?
###5440 And it's safe to say that goal would be to survive.
###5444 And not to just survive, but to do so
###5446 in an optimized, healthy, prosperous way.
###5449 Most people, indeed, desire to live
###5451 and they would prefer to do so without suffering.
###5454 Therefore, the basis of this civilization needs to be
###5457 as supportive and hence sustainable for human life as possible-
###5461 .
###5461 taking into account the material needs of all the world's people
###5465 .
###5465 while trying to remove anything
###5467 that can could hurt us in the long run.
###5469 With that goal of “Maximum Sustainability” understood
###5473 the next question regards our “method”.
###5476 What kind of approach do we take?
###5478 Well, let's see-
###5480 last I checked, politics was the method of social operation on Earth...
###5484 so what do the doctrines of the republicans, liberals,
###5487 conservatives or socialists have to say about societal design?
###5492 Hmmm... not a damn thing.
###5495 Okay then- what about religion?
###5497 Surely the great creator had to have left some blueprints somewhere...
###5501 Nope... nothing I can find.
###5504 Okay then- so what's left?
###5506 It appears something called “Science”.
###5509 Science is unique in that its methods demand not only
###5513 that ideas proposed be tested and replicated,
###5516 but everything science comes up with is also inherently falsifiable.
###5521 In other words, unlike religion and politics
###5523 science has no ego
###5525 and everything it suggests accepts the possibility
###5528 of being proven wrong eventually.
###5531 It holds on to nothing and evolves constantly.
###5534 Well, that sounds natural enough to me.
###5537 So then: based on the current state of scientific knowledge
###5540 in the early 21st century
###5542 along with our goal of “maximum sustainability”
###5545 for the human population,
###5547 how do we begin the actual process of construction?
###5550 Well, the first question to ask is:
###5552 What do we need to survive?
###5555 The answer, of course, are Planetary Resources.
###5558 Whether it is the water we drink, the energy we use
###5561 or the raw materials we utilize to create tools and shelter,
###5565 the planet hosts an inventory of resources-
###5568 many of which are demanded for our survival.
###5572 So, given that reality
###5574 it then becomes critical to figure out what we have and where it is.
###5578 This means we need to conduct a survey.
###5581 We simply locate and identify every physical resource on the planet
###5585 we can, along with the amount available at each location.
###5589 From the deposits of copper, to the most potent locations for
###5592 wind farms to produce energy, to the natural fresh water springs
###5597 .
###5597 to an assessment of the amount of fish in the ocean
###5599 to the most prime arable land for food cultivation, etc.
###5604 But, since we humans are going to be
###5606 consuming these resources over time
###5609 we then realize that not only do we need to locate and identify-
###5613 we also need to track.
###5616 We need to make sure we don't run out
###5617 of any of this stuff; that would be bad.
###5620 And this means not only tracking our rates of use
###5623 but the rates of earthly regeneration as well
###5626 such as how long it takes for say,
###5628 a tree to grow or a spring to replenish.
###5632 This is called “Dynamic Equilibrium”.
###5635 In other words, if we use up trees faster than they can be grown back,
###5640 we have a serious problem, for it is unsustainable.
###5643 So then, how do we track this inventory
###5646 especially when we recognize that
###5648 all of this stuff is scattered everywhere?
###5651 We have large mineral mines in what we call Africa,
###5655 energy concentrations in the Middle East,
###5657 huge tidal power possibilities on the Atlantic coast of North America,
###5661 the largest supply of fresh water in Brazil, etc.
###5665 Well, once again, good old science has a suggestion:
###5669 It's called “Systems theory”.
###5672 Systems theory recognizes that the fabric of the natural world,
###5676 from human biology to the earthly biosphere
###5679 to the gravitational pull of the solar system itself,
###5682 is one huge synergistically connected system - fully interlinked.
###5687 Just as human cells connect to form our organs
###5690 and the organs connect to form our bodies
###5693 and since our bodies cannot live without the earthy resources
###5696 of food, air and water, we are intrinsically connected to the earth.
###5701 And so on.
###5702 So, as nature suggests, we take all of this inventory
###5706 and tracking data, and create a “system” to manage it.
###5710 A “Global Resource Management System”, in fact,
###5713 to account for every relevant resource on the planet.
###5717 There is simply no logical alternative, if our goal as a species
###5721 is survival in the long run. We have to keep track as a whole.
###5726 That understood, we can now consider production.
###5729 How do we use all this stuff?
###5731 What will our process of production be, and what do we need
###5734 to consider to make sure it is as optimized as possible,
###5738 to maximize our sustainability?
###5741 Well, the first thing that jumps right out at us, is the fact
###5744 that we need to constantly try and preserve.
###5747 The planet's resources are essentially finite.
###5750 So it is important that we be “strategic”.
###5753 "Strategic Preservation" is key.
###5757 The second thing we recognize, is that some resources
###5760 are really not as good as others in their performance.
###5763 In fact, some of this stuff when put into use
###5766 has a terrible effect on the environment,
###5768 which invariably hinders our own health.
###5770 For example: oil and fossil fuels, no matter how you cut it,
###5775 release some pretty destructive agents into the environment.
###5778 Therefore, it is critical we do our best to use such things
###5782 only when we really have to- if at all.
###5785 Fortunately for us, we see a ton of solar – wind – tidal – wave –
###5790 heat differential and geothermal possibilities for energy production.
###5795 So we can strategize objectively, about what we use and where,
###5799 to avoid what could be called “negative retroactions”,
###5803 or anything that results from production or use
###5806 that damages the environment and hence, ourselves.
###5810 We will call this “Strategic Safety”
###5813 to couple in with our "Strategic Preservation”.
###5817 But production strategies do not stop there.
###5820 We are going to need an "Efficiency Strategy”,
###5823 for the actual mechanics of production itself.
###5826 And what we find is that there are roughly
###5828 three specific protocols we must adhere to:
###5832 1: Every good we produce must be designed
###5835 to last as long as possible.
###5837 Naturally, the more things break down,
###5839 the more resources we are going to need to replace them,
###5842 and the more waste produced.
###5844 2: When things do break down,
###5847 or are no longer usable for whatever reason,
###5850 it is critical that we harvest, or recycle
###5852 as much as we possibly can.
###5854 So the production design must take this into account directly
###5858 at the very earliest stages.
###5861 3: Quickly evolving technologies, such as electronics,
###5865 which are subject to the fastest rates of technological obsolescence,
###5869 would need to be designed to foreshadow
###5872 and accommodate physical updates.
###5875 The last thing we want to do is throw away an entire computer system
###5879 just because it has only one broken part, or is outdated.
###5883 So we simply design the components to be easily updated,
###5886 part by part, standardized and universally interchangeable,
###5891 foreshadowed by the current trend of technological change.
###5895 And when we realize that the mechanisms of "Strategic Preservation”,
###5899 “Strategic Safety” and “Strategic Efficiency”
###5903 are purely technical considerations
###5905 devoid of any human opinion or bias,
###5908 we simply program these strategies into a computer
###5912 which can weigh and calculate all the relevant variables,
###5915 allowing us to always arrive
###5917 at the absolute best method for sustainable production
###5920 based on current understandings.
###5923 And while that might sound complex
###5926 all it is, is a glorified calculator,
###5928 not to mention that such multi-varied
###5930 decision making and monitoring systems,
###5932 are already used across the world today for isolated purposes.
###5936 It is simply a process of scaling it out.
###5940 So...
###5941 Now, we not only have our Resource Management System,
###5944 but also a Production Management System,
###5947 both of which are easily computer automated
###5950 to maximize efficiency, preservation and safety.
###5954 The informational reality is that the human mind
###5957 or even a group of humans, cannot track what needs to be tracked.
###5961 It must be done by computers, and it can be.
###5965 And this bring us to the next level: Distribution.
###5969 What sustainability strategies make sense here?
###5972 Well, since we know that the shortest distance
###5974 between two points is a straight line,
###5977 and since energy is required to power transport machines,
###5980 the less transport distance, the more efficient.
###5984 Producing goods in one continent and shipping them over to another
###5988 only makes sense if the goods in question
###5991 simply cannot be produced in the target area.
###5994 Otherwise, it is nothing but wasteful.
###5996 We must localize production, so distribution is simple,
###6000 fast, and requires the least amount of energy.
###6003 We'll call this the “Proximity Strategy”,
###6006 which simply means we reduce
###6008 the travel of goods as much as possible
###6010 whether raw materials or finished consumer products.
###6014 Of course, it might also be important to know
###6016 what goods we are transporting and why.
###6019 And this falls under the category of Demand.
###6022 And demand is simply what people need to be healthy
###6025 and to have a high quality of life.
###6028 The spectrum of material human needs
###6030 range from core life supporting necessities
###6033 such as food, clean water and shelter,
###6036 to social and recreational goods which allow for relaxation
###6040 and personal, social enjoyment:
###6042 both important factors in human and social health overall.
###6047 So, very simply, we take another survey.
###6050 People describe their needs, demand is assessed,
###6053 and production begins based on that demand.
###6056 And since the level of demand of different goods
###6058 will naturally fluctuate and change around different regions,
###6062 we need to create a “Demand / Distribution Tracking System"
###6066 so to avoid overruns and shortages.
###6070 Of course, this idea is old news;
###6072 it is used in every major store chain today
###6075 to make sure they keep up with their inventory.
###6078 Only this time, we are tracking on a global scale.
###6081 But, wait a minute. We really can't fully understand demand
###6085 if we don't account for the actual usage of the good itself.
###6090 Is it logical and sustainable for every single human to say,
###6094 have one of everything made? Regardless of their usage?
###6098 No. That would be simply wasteful and inefficient.
###6103 If a person has a need for a good but that need is only for say,
###6106 45 minutes a day on average, it would be much more efficient
###6110 .
###6110 if that good was made available to them
###6112 and to others when needed.
###6116 Many forget that it isn't the good that they want,
###6118 it is the purpose of that good.
###6120 When we realize that the good itself
###6122 is only as important as its utility,
###6125 we see that “external restriction”,
###6128 or what we might call today “ownership”,
###6130 is extremely wasteful and environmentally illogical
###6134 in a fundamental, economic sense.
###6137 So, we need to devise a strategy called: “Strategic Access”.
###6142 This would be the foundation of our
###6144 "Demand / Distribution Tracking System”
###6146 which makes sure we can meet
###6148 the demand of the population's needs
###6150 for access of whatever they need, when they need it.
###6154 And as far as physically obtaining the goods,
###6157 centralized and regional access centers
###6160 all make sense for the most part,
###6162 placed in close proximity to the population
###6165 and a person would simply come in, take the item,
###6168 use it and when finished, return it when it is no longer needed...
###6172 sort of how a library works today.
###6174 In fact, these centers could not only exist in the community
###6177 in the way we see local stores today,
###6180 but specialized access centers would exist in specific areas
###6184 where often certain goods are utilized,
###6186 saving more energy with less repeat transport.
###6190 And once this Demand Tracking System is in order,
###6193 it is tied into our Production Management system,
###6196 and of course, into our Resource Management system.
###6200 Hence creating a unified, dynamically updating,
###6203 global economic management machine,
###6206 that simply makes sure we remain sustainable.
###6208 Starting with securing the integrity of our finite resources,
###6212 moving to make sure we only create the best,
###6215 most strategic goods possible,
###6217 while distributing everything
###6219 in the most intelligent and efficient way.
###6222 And the unique result of this preservation-based approach,
###6227 which is intuitively counter to many,
###6230 is that this logical, ground up
###6232 empirical process of preservation and efficiency
###6236 - which can only define true human sustainability on this planet -
###6241 would likely enable something never before seen in human history:
###6245 Access Abundance.
###6247 Not just for a percentage of the global population,
###6251 but the entire civilization.
###6255 This economic model, as was just generalized...
###6258 this responsible, systems approach
###6261 to total Earth resource management and processes,
###6264 designed, again, to do nothing less
###6266 than take care of humanity as a whole
###6268 in the most efficient and sustainable way,
###6271 could be termed:
###6272 a “RESOURCE-BASED ECONOMY”.
###6275 The idea was defined in the 1970s
###6278 by structural engineer Jacque Fresco.
###6281 He understood back then that society was on a collision course
###6284 with nature and itself, unsustainable on every level,
###6288 and if things didn't change,
###6290 we would destroy ourselves, one way or another.
###6294 Are all of these things you are saying Jacque,
###6296 could they be built with what we know today?
###6298 Or, ... are you guessing
###6301 based on what we know today?
###6302 No. All of these things can be built with what we know today.
###6306 It would take 10 years to change the surface of the earth.
###6309 To rebuild the world into a second Garden of Eden.
###6312 The choice lies with you.
###6313 The stupidity of a nuclear arms race,
###6316 the development of weapons,
###6317 trying to solve your problems politically
###6320 by electing this political party or that political party,
###6323 that all politics is immersed in corruption.
###6325 Let me say it again:
###6326 Communism, socialism, fascism, the Democrats, the liberals-
###6331 we want to absorb human beings ...
###6333 all organizations that believe in a better life for man!
###6337 There are no Negro problems or Polish problems
###6340 or Jewish problems or Greek problems
###6342 or women's problems – there are human problems!
###6345 I'm not afraid of anybody, I don't work for anyone;
###6347 no one can discharge me.
###6349 I have no boss.
###6351 I am afraid to live in the society we live in today.
###6354 Our society cannot be maintained by this type of incompetency.
###6357 It was great- the free enterprise system-
###6360 about 35 years ago. That was the last of its usefulness.
###6363 Now we have got to change our way of thinking or perish.
###6368 The horror movies of the future will be our society-
###6372 the way it didn't work-
###6374 and politics ...
###6375 would be part of a horror movie.
###6379 Well, lots of people today use the term 'cold science'
###6385 because it's analytical,
###6387 and they don't even know what analytical means.
###6390 Science means: closer approximations
###6392 to the way the world really works.
###6395 So, it's telling the truth- is what it is.
###6398 A scientist doesn't try to get along with people.
###6401 They tell them what their findings are.
###6404 They have to question all things.
###6407 And if some scientist comes up with an experiment
###6410 that shows certain materials have certain strengths,
###6413 other scientists have to be able to duplicate that experiment
###6417 and come up with the same results.
###6419 Even if a scientist feels that an airplane wing
###6423 due to mathematics or calculations
###6425 can hold up a given amount of weight
###6427 they still pile sandbags on it
###6430 to see when it breaks, and they say
###6433 'you know my calculations are right' or 'they are not correct.'
###6436 I love that system because it's free of bias
###6440 and free of thinking that math can solve all the problems.
###6443 You have to put your Math to test also.
###6446 I think that every system that can be put to test
###6450 should be put to test.
###6451 And that all decisions should be based upon research.
###6456 A Resource-Based Economy is simply
###6459 the scientific method applied to social concern-
###6462 an approach utterly absent in the world today.
###6465 Society is a technical invention.
###6467 And the most efficient methods of optimized human health,
###6470 physical production, distribution, city infrastructure and the like
###6475 reside in the field of science and technology-
###6477 not politics or monetary economics.
###6481 It operates in the same systematic way as, say an airplane
###6485 and there is no Republican or Liberal way to build an airplane.
###6489 Likewise, nature itself is the physical referent we use
###6493 to prove our science, and it is a set system-
###6496 .
###6496 emerging only from our increased understanding of it.
###6499 In fact, it has no regard for what you
###6501 subjectively think or believe to be true.
###6504 Rather, it gives you an option:
###6506 you can learn and fall in line with its natural laws
###6509 and conduct yourself accordingly-
###6511 invariably creating good health and sustainability,
###6514 or you can go against the current- to no avail.
###6517 It doesn't matter how much you believe you can just
###6519 stand up right now and walk on the wall next to you;
###6522 the law of gravity will not allow it.
###6524 If you do not eat- you will die.
###6526 If you are not touched as an infant- you will die.
###6529 As harsh as it may sound, nature is a dictatorship
###6533 and we can either listen to it and come in harmony with it
###6537 or suffer the inevitable adverse consequences.
###6540 So, a Resource-Based Economy
###6542 is nothing more than a set of proven,
###6544 life supporting understandings
###6546 where all decisions are based upon
###6549 optimized human and environmental sustainability.
###6552 It takes into account the empirical “Life Ground”
###6556 which every human being shares as a need
###6558 regardless, again, of their political or religious philosophy.
###6562 There is no cultural relativism to this approach.
###6566 It isn't a matter of o
###6568 Human needs are human needs.
###6570 And having access to the necessities of life, such as clean air,
###6574 nutritious food and clean water,
###6577 along with a positively reinforcing, stable,
###6580 nurturing, non-violent environment,
###6583 is demanded for our mental and physical health,
###6587 our evolutionary fitness,
###6589 and hence, the species' survival itself.
###6592 A Resource-Based Economy
###6594 would be based upon available resources.
###6598 You can't just bring a lot of people to an island
###6601 or build a city of 50,000 people without having access
###6606 to the necessities of life.
###6608 So, when I use the term 'a comprehensive systems approach'
###6613 I'm talking about doing an inventory of the area first
###6617 and determining what that area can supply-
###6620 not just architectural approach-
###6623 not just design approach-
###6626 but design must be based on all of the requirements
###6629 to enhance human life.
###6631 And that's what I mean by an integrated way of thinking.
###6635 Food, clothing, shelter, warmth, love-
###6637 all those things are necessary.
###6640 And if you deprive people of any of them
###6643 you have a lesser human being, less capable of functioning.
###6649 As previously outlined, a Resource-Based Economy's ground-up
###6653 global, systems approach to extraction, production and distribution
###6657 is based upon on a set of true economic mechanisms, or 'strategies'
###6662 which guarantee efficiency and sustainability
###6665 in every area of the economy.
###6668 So, continuing this train of thought regarding logical design,
###6672 what is next in our equation?
###6674 Where does all this materialize?
###6676 Cities.
###6678 The advent of the city is a defining feature of modern civilization.
###6682 Its role is to enable efficient access to the necessities of life
###6686 along with increased social support and community interaction.
###6691 So how would we go about designing an ideal city?
###6694 What shape should we make it?
###6695 Square? Trapezoid?
###6698 Well, given we are going to be moving around the thing
###6700 we might as well make it as equidistant as possible for ease,
###6703 hence the circle.
###6705 What should the city contain?
###6707 Well, naturally we need a residential area, a goods production area,
###6711 a power generation area, an agricultural area.
###6715 But we also need nurturing as human beings-
###6718 hence culture, nature, recreation and education.
###6722 So lets include a nice open park,
###6724 an entertainment/events area for cultural purposes and socializing
###6728 and educational and research facilities.
###6731 And since we are working with a circle
###6733 it seems rational to place these functions in belts
###6736 based on the amount of land required for each goal
###6739 along with ease of access.
###6741 Very good.
###6743 Now, let's get down to specifics:
###6745 First we need the consider the core infrastructure
###6748 or intestines of the city organism.
###6751 These would be the water, goods,
###6753 waste and energy transport channels.
###6755 Just as we have water and sewage systems under our cities today,
###6759 we would extend this channeling concept
###6761 to integrate waste recycling and delivery itself.
###6765 No more mailmen or garbage men.
###6767 It is built right in. We could even use
###6769 automated pneumatic tubes and similar technologies.
###6773 Same goes for transport.
###6775 It needs to be integrated and strategically designed to reduce
###6778 or even remove the need for wasteful, independent automobiles.
###6782 Electric trams, conveyors, transveyors
###6785 and maglevs- which can take you virtually
###6787 anywhere in the city, even up and down,
###6790 along with connecting you to other cities as well.
###6793 And of course, in the event a car is required,
###6796 it is automated by satellite for safety and integrity.
###6800 In fact, this automation technology is in working order right now.
###6804 Automobile accidents kill about 1.2 million people every single year,
###6809 injuring about 50 million.
###6811 This is absurd and doesn't have to occur.
###6814 Between efficient city design and automated, driverless cars
###6817 this death toll can be virtually eliminated.
###6821 Agriculture.
###6822 Today, through our haphazard, cost-cutting industrial methods-
###6826 using pesticides, excessive fertilizers and other means-
###6830 we have successfully destroyed
###6832 much of the the arable land on this planet,
###6834 not to mention also extensively poisoning our bodies.
###6837 In fact, industrial and agricultural chemical toxins
###6841 now show up in virtually every human being tested, including infants.
###6847 Fortunately, there is a glaring alternative:
###6849 the soil-less mediums of hydroponics and aeroponics,
###6853 which also reduce nutrient and water requirements
###6856 by up to 75% of our current usage.
###6860 Food can now be organically grown on an industrial scale
###6864 in enclosed vertical farms,
###6866 such as in 50-story 1-acre plots,
###6869 virtually eliminating the need
###6871 for pesticides and hydrocarbons in general.
###6874 This is the future of industrial food cultivation:
###6877 efficient, clean and abundant.
###6880 So, such advanced systems would be, in part,
###6883 what comprise our agricultural belt,
###6886 producing all the food required for the entire city's population
###6889 with no need to import anything from the outside,
###6892 saving time, waste and energy.
###6896 And speaking of Energy,
###6898 the Energy Belt would work in a systems approach
###6900 to extract electricity from our abundant renewable mediums-
###6904 specifically wind, solar, geothermal and heat differentials-
###6908 and if near water potentials- tidal and wave power.
###6912 To avoid intermittency and make sure
###6914 a positive net energy return occurs,
###6917 these mediums would operate in an integrated system
###6920 powering each other when needed,
###6922 while storing excessive energy to large super capacitors
###6926 under the ground, so nothing can go to waste.
###6929 .
###6929 And not only does the city power itself,
###6931 particular structures will also power independently
###6934 and generate electricity through photovoltaic paints,
###6938 structural pressure transducers, the thermocouple effect,
###6941 and other current but underutilized technologies.
###6945 But of course, this begs the question:
###6947 How does this technology, and goods in general,
###6950 get created in the first place?
###6952 This bring us to Production:
###6954 The Industrial Belt, apart from having hospitals and the like,
###6957 would be the hub of factory production.
###6959 Completely localized overall,
###6961 it would, of course, obtain raw materials
###6963 by way of the global resource management system just discussed,
###6967 with demand being generated by the population of the city itself.
###6972 As far as the mechanics of production,
###6974 we need to discuss a new, powerful phenomenon
###6977 which was sparked very recently in human history
###6980 and is on pace to changing everything.
###6983 It's called Mechanization
###6985 or the automation of labor.
###6988 Well, if you look around, you'll notice that
###6990 almost everything that we use today is built automatically.
###6996 .
###6997 Your shoes, your clothes, your home appliances, your car and so on...
###7002 they are all built by machines in an automatic way.
###7008 Can we say that the society has not been influenced
###7012 by these major technological advancements?
###7016 Of course not.
###7017 These systems really dictate new structures
###7022 and new needs and they make a lot of other things obsolete.
###7027 So, we have been going up in the development
###7032 and use of technology in an exponential way.
###7036 So, definitely automation is going to continue.
###7040 You cannot stop technologies that just make sense.
###7044 Labor automation through technology is at the bottom
###7047 of every major social transformation in human history.
###7051 From the agricultural revolution and the invention of the plow,
###7054 to the industrial revolution and the invention of the powered machine,
###7058 to the information age we live in now,
###7060 through essentially the invention
###7062 of advanced electronics and computers.
###7065 And with regard to advanced production methods today
###7068 mechanization is now evolving on its own:
###7071 moving away from the traditional method
###7073 of assembling component parts into a configuration,
###7076 into an advanced method of creating
###7078 entire products in one single process.
###7082 Like most engineers, I'm fascinated by biology because it is
###7085 so full of examples of extraordinary pieces of engineering.
###7091 What biology is - is the study of things that copy themselves.
###7096 As good a definition of life as we've got.
###7098 Again, as an engineer, I have always been intrigued
###7100 by the idea of machines copying themselves.
###7103 RepRap is a three-dimensional printer -
###7105 that's to say it is a printer that you plug into your computer and
###7109 instead of making 2-dimensional sheets of paper with patterns on,
###7112 it makes real, physical, 3-dimensional objects.
###7115 Now there's nothing new about that.
###7117 3D printers have been around for about 30 years.
###7120 The big thing about RepRap is that it prints most of its own parts.
###7125 So, if you've got one, you could make another one
###7127 and give it to a friend as well as being able to print
###7130 lots of useful things.
###7131 From the simple printing of basic household goods in your home
###7135 to the printing of an entire automobile body in one swoop,
###7138 advanced, automated 3D printing now has the potential
###7141 to transform virtually every field of production,
###7145 including home construction.
###7147 Contour Crafting is actually a fabrication technology-
###7153 .
###7153 the so-called 3D printing- when you directly build
###7156 3D objects from a computer model.
###7160 Using Contour Crafting, it will be possible
###7163 to build a 2000 square-foot home
###7166 entirely by the machine, in one day.
###7171 The reason that people are interested in automating construction
###7176 is that it really brings a lot of benefits.
###7179 For example, construction is pretty labor-intensive.
###7183 And although it provides jobs for a sector of the society
###7189 it also has issues and complications.
###7194 For example, construction is the most dangerous job that there is.
###7199 It is worse than mining and agriculture,
###7202 that has the highest level of fatality in almost every country.
###7207 Another issue is the waste.
###7210 An average home in the United States has 3 to 7 tons of waste.
###7215 So this is huge if we look at the impact of construction,
###7221 and knowing about 40% of all materials in the world
###7224 are used in construction.
###7227 So, a big waste of energy and resources
###7231 and big damage to the environment as well.
###7234 Making homes using hammers and nails and wood
###7239 with the state of our technology today, is really absurd
###7243 and will go the way of our labor class
###7247 in regards to manufacturing in the United States.
###7250 Recently, there was a study by economist David Autor of MIT,
###7256 that states that our middle class is obsolete
###7260 and being replaced by automation.
###7263 Quite simply, Mechanization is more productive,
###7266 efficient and sustainable than human labor
###7269 in virtually every sector of the economy today.
###7273 Machines do not need vacations, breaks, insurance, pensions,
###7276 and they can work 24 hours a day, everyday.
###7279 The output potential and accuracy
###7282 compared to human labor, is unmatched.
###7285 The bottom line: repetitive human labor is becoming obsolete
###7289 and impractical across the world.
###7291 And the unemployment you see around you today is fundamentally
###7295 the result of this evolution of efficiency in technology.
###7299 .
###7300 For years, market economists have dismissed this growing pattern
###7303 which could be called “Technological Unemployment”,
###7307 because of the fact that new sectors always seemed
###7309 to emerge to re-absorb the displaced workers.
###7312 Today, the service sector is the only real hub left
###7316 and currently employs over 80% of the American workforce
###7319 with most industrialized countries maintaining a similar proportion.
###7324 However, this sector is now being challenged increasingly
###7327 by automated kiosks, automated restaurants,
###7331 and even automated stores.
###7333 Economists today are finally acknowledging
###7335 what they had been denying for years:
###7337 Not only is technological unemployment exacerbating
###7340 the current labor crisis we see across the world
###7343 due to the global economic downturn,
###7346 but the more the recession deepens
###7348 the faster the industries are mechanizing.
###7351 The catch, which is not realized,
###7353 is that the faster they mechanize to save money-
###7356 the more they displace people-
###7357 the more they reduce public purchasing power.
###7361 This means that, while the corporation
###7363 can produce everything more cheaply,
###7364 fewer and fewer people will actually have money to buy anything
###7368 regardless of how cheap they become.
###7371 The bottom line is that the “labor for income” game
###7374 is slowly coming to an end.
###7376 In fact, if you take a moment to reflect
###7379 on the jobs which are in existence today
###7381 which automation could take over right now if applied,
###7385 75% of the global workforce
###7387 could be replaced by mechanization tomorrow.
###7391 And this is why, in a Resource-Based Economy,
###7394 there is no Monetary-Market system.
###7397 No money at all...
###7399 for there is no need.
###7401 A Resource-Based Economy
###7402 recognizes the efficiency of mechanization
###7406 and accepts it for what it offers.
###7407 It doesn't fight it, like we do today.
###7410 Why? Because it is irresponsible not to,
###7413 given any interest in efficiency and sustainability.
###7418 And this brings us back to our city system.
###7421 In the center is the Central Dome, which not only houses
###7424 .
###7424 the educational facilities and transportation hub,
###7427 it also hosts the mainframe
###7429 that runs the cities technical operations.
###7432 The city is, in fact, one big automated machine.
###7436 It has sensors in all technical belts
###7438 to track the progress of agriculture,
###7439 energy gathering, production, distribution and the like.
###7444 Now, would people be needed to oversee these operations
###7447 in the event of a malfunction or the like?
###7449 Most probably: yes.
###7451 But that number would decrease over time as improvements continue.
###7455 .
###7455 However, as of today, maybe 3% of the city population
###7459 would be needed for this job when you break it down.
###7461 .
###7462 And I can assure you: that in an economic system
###7466 .
###7466 which is actually designed to take care of you
###7468 and secure your well being, without you having to submit
###7471 .
###7472 to a private dictatorship on a daily basis
###7475 usually to a job that is either technically unnecessary
###7478 or socially pointless,
###7480 while often struggling with debt that doesn't exist
###7483 just to make ends meet...
###7485 I guarantee you: people will volunteer their time left and right
###7490 to maintain and improve a system that actually takes care of them.
###7497 .
###7497 And coupled with this issue of 'Incentive'
###7500 comes the common assumption
###7502 that if there isn't some external pressure
###7504 for one to “work for a living”
###7506 people would just sit around, do nothing
###7509 and turn into fat lazy blobs.
###7512 This is nonsense.
###7514 The labor system we have today
###7516 is in fact the generator of laziness, not a resolver of it.
###7522 .
###7522 If you think back to when you were a child-
###7524 full of life, interested in new things to understand,
###7527 likely creating and exploring...
###7529 But as time went on, the system pushed you
###7532 into the focus of figuring out how to make money.
###7536 And from early education,
###7538 to study at a university, you are narrowed.
###7541 Only to emerge as a creature which serves as a cog in a wheel
###7545 .
###7545 in a model that sends all the fruits to the upper 1%.
###7549 Scientific Studies have now shown that people are, in fact,
###7552 not motivated by monetary reward
###7555 when it comes to ingenuity and creation.
###7557 The creation itself is the reward.
###7560 Money, in fact, appears only to serve as an incentive
###7563 for repetitive, mundane actions
###7566 a role we have just now shown can be replaced by machine.
###7570 So when it comes to innovation- the actual use of the human mind-
###7574 .
###7575 the monetary incentive has proven to be a hindrance,
###7577 interfering and detracting from creative thought.
###7581 And this might explain why Nikola Tesla, the Wright Brothers,
###7584 and other inventors who contributed massively to our current world
###7588 .
###7588 never showed a monetary incentive to do so.
###7591 Money is, in fact, a false incentive
###7595 and causes 100 times more distortion than it does contribution.
###7602 .
###7602 Good morning class. Please settle down.
###7604 The first thing I would like to do is go around the room
###7608 and ask what everyone would like to be when they grow up.
###7611 Who would like to go first?
###7614 Okay, how about you Sarah?
###7616 When I grow up I want to work at McDonald's like my mom!
###7620 Oh, family tradition, eh?
###7623 How about you, Linda?
###7625 When I grow up, I'm going to be a prostitute
###7628 on the streets of New York City!
###7631 Oh! glamour girl, huh? Very ambitious.
###7635 .
###7635 How about you, Tommy?
###7636 When I grow up, I'm going to be a rich, elitist businessman
###7640 who works on Wall Street and profits
###7642 .
###7642 off of the collapse of foreign economies.
###7645 Enterprising... and great to see some multicultural interest!
###7650 .
###7651 [Victims of Culture]
###7653 As stated before, a Resource-Based Economy
###7656 applies the Scientific Method to social concern
###7660 and this isn't limited to simply technical efficiency.
###7663 It also has the consideration of human
###7665 and social well-being directly and what comprises it.
###7669 What good is a social system if, in the end,
###7672 it doesn't produce happiness and peaceful coexistence?
###7676 So, it is important to point out
###7678 that with the removal of the money system
###7680 and the necessities of life provided
###7682 we would see a global reduction in crime
###7685 by about 95% almost immediately-
###7688 for there is nothing to steal, embezzle, scam, or the like.
###7692 95% of all people in prisons today are there
###7694 due to some monetary related crime or drug abuse
###7698 and drug abuse is a disorder- not a crime.
###7703 So what about the other 5%?, the truly violent...
###7706 .
###7707 often seeming to some as being violent
###7709 for the sake of being violent...
###7711 are they just “evil” people?
###7715 The reason that I frankly think it's a waste of time
###7720 to engage in moral value judgments about people's violence
###7726 .
###7726 is because it doesn't advance by one iota
###7730 our understanding of either the causes
###7733 or the prevention of the violent behavior.
###7737 People sometimes ask if I believe in “forgiving” criminals.
###7742 My answer to that is
###7744 “No, I don't believe in forgiveness
###7747 anymore than I believe in condemnation.”
###7750 It's only if we, as a society,
###7753 can take the same attitude of treating violence
###7756 as a problem in public health and preventive medicine
###7759 rather than as a moral "evil"...
###7763 It's only when we make that change
###7765 in our own attitudes and assumptions and values
###7768 that we will actually succeed in reducing the level of violence
###7772 rather than stimulating it, which is what we do now.
###7776 .
###7776 The more justice you seek, the more hurt you become
###7779 because there's no such thing as justice.
###7781 There is whatever there is out there. That's it.
###7786 In other words, if people are conditioned to be racist bigots-
###7790 if they are brought up in an environment that advocates that-
###7793 why do you blame the person for it?
###7795 They are a victim of a subculture.
###7798 Therefore they have to be helped.
###7800 The point is, we have to redesign the environment
###7803 that produces aberrant behavior. That's the problem.
###7807 .
###7807 Not putting a person in jail.
###7809 That's why judges, lawyers, “freedom of choice”-
###7813 such concepts are dangerous!
###7816 Because it gives you mis-information
###7819 that the person is “bad”, or that person is a “serial killer”.
###7823 Serial killers are made
###7825 just like soldiers become serial killers with a machine gun.
###7830 They become killing machines,
###7832 but nobody looks at them as murderers or assassins
###7835 because that's “natural”.
###7837 So we blame people.
###7839 We say, “Well, this guy was a Nazi- he tortured Jews.”
###7842 No, he was brought up to torture Jews.
###7845 Once you accept the fact that people have individual choices
###7849 and they are free to make those choices- ...
###7852 Free to make choices means without being influenced.
###7855 .
###7855 And I can't understand that at all.
###7858 All of us are influenced in all of our choices
###7862 by the culture we live in, by our parents
###7865 and by the values that dominate.
###7867 So we're influenced- so there can't be “free” choices.
###7871 'What's the greatest country in the world?' - the true answer:
###7873 'I haven't been all over the world and I don't know enough
###7877 about different cultures to answer that question.'
###7880 I don't know anybody that speaks that way.
###7882 They say, "It's the good old USA! The greatest country in the world!"
###7886 .
###7886 There is no survey... 'Have you been to India?' - 'No.'
###7888 'Have you been to England?' - 'No.' 'Have you been to France?' - 'No.'
###7891 .
###7891 'Then what do you make your assumptions on?'
###7893 They can't answer, they get mad at you. They say,
###7896 'God dammit! Who the hell are you to tell me what to think?!'
###7899 .
###7899 You know... Don't forget: you're dealing with aberrated people.
###7902 They are not responsible for their answers;
###7905 they're victims of culture and that means
###7907 they have been influenced by their culture.
###7931 [ Part 4: Rise ]
###7937 When we consider a Resource-Based Economy
###7940 there are often a number of arguments that tend to come up with...
###7943 [ EH! ] (Interrupted)
###7945 [ Eh! Hey! ]
###7946 [ Now hold on just a minute! ] - Yes?
###7949 [ I know what this is. This is called Marxism, buddy! ]
###7953 [ Stalin killed 800 billion people because of ideas like this... ]
###7958 [ My father died in the Gulag! ] - All right, hold on, hold on ...
###7962 [ Communist! Fascist! ]
###7964 [You don't like America you should just leave!]
###7966 All right, everybody just calm down...
###7967 [ Death to the New World Order! ]
###7969 [ Death to the New World Order! ]
###7971 And as the irrationality of the audience grew,
###7974 shocked and confused, suddenly
###7975 the narrator suffered a fatal heart attack.
###7979 And the seemingly communist propaganda film was no more.
###7985 [System Error]
###7990 [Backup Initiated - Restored]
###7993 But you know, I've said that sort of thing to people
###7996 in think-tank type of situations,
###8000 you know these Club of Rome types and so forth...
###8003 they say 'Marxist!'
###8004 What? Marxist? Where did that come from?
###8007 They just got this icon they hold onto- It's their Holy Grail
###8012 .
###8012 and it's such an easy one, you know.
###8014 People ask if I'm a Socialist or a Communist or Capitalist.
###8018 And I say I am none of the above.
###8019 And why do you think that those are the only options?
###8023 All of those political constructs were created by writers
###8026 who assumed we lived on a planet of infinite resources.
###8030 .
###8030 Not one of those political philosophies even contemplates
###8034 that there might be a shortage of anything!
###8036 I believe that communism, socialism, free enterprise, fascism
###8041 are part of social evolution.
###8043 You can't take a giant step from one culture to another-
###8048 .
###8048 there are in-between systems.
###8049 Before there's any “ism”, we've got a life ground.
###8052 And the life ground is as I've just described most easily
###8054 as all the conditions required to take your next breath.
###8057 .
###8057 And that involves the air you breathe, the water you get,
###8061 the safety you have, the education you can access
###8065 .
###8065 - all these things that we share and use
###8067 and that no life, in any culture, can do without.
###8071 So we've got to reset down to the Life Ground
###8075 and the life ground is no longer any “ism”.
###8077 It's “life value analysis.”
###8081 [ Beyond The Pale ]
###8083 It's simply a matter of historical fact
###8085 that the dominant intellectual culture
###8088 of any particular society reflects the interests
###8091 of the dominant group in that society.
###8094 In a slave owning society
###8096 the beliefs about human beings and human rights
###8099 and so on will reflect the needs of the slave owners.
###8102 In the society, which again is based on
###8105 the power of certain people to control and profit from
###8110 the lives and work of millions of others,
###8113 the dominant intellectual culture
###8115 will reflect the needs of the dominant group.
###8118 So, if you look across the board,
###8121 the ideas that pervade psychology and sociology
###8126 .
###8126 and history and political economy and political science
###8130 fundamentally reflect certain elite interests.
###8134 And the academics who question that too much
###8138 tend to get shunted to the side or to be seen as sort of “radicals”.
###8143 .
###8143 The dominant values of a culture
###8145 tend to support and perpetuate
###8147 what is rewarded by that culture.
###8150 And in a society where success and status
###8152 is measured by material wealth- not social contribution-
###8156 .
###8156 it is easy to see why the state of the world is what it is today.
###8161 We are dealing with a value system disorder
###8164 - completely denatured -
###8166 where the priority of personal and social health
###8168 have become secondary to the detrimental notions
###8172 of artificial wealth and limitless growth.
###8175 And, like a virus, this disorder now permeates every facet of
###8178 .
###8178 government - news media - entertainment - and even academia.
###8183 And built into its structure are mechanisms of protection
###8187 .
###8187 from anything that might interfere.
###8190 Disciples of the Monetary-Market religion-
###8193 the Self-Appointed Guardians of the Status Quo-
###8196 constantly seek out ways to avoid any form of thought
###8200 which might interfere with their beliefs,
###8202 the most common of which are Projected Dualities.
###8206 If you're not a Republican, you must be a Democrat.
###8209 If you are not Christian, you might be a Satanist.
###8212 And if you feel society can be greatly improved
###8215 to consider, perhaps - I don't know - taking care of everyone?
###8219 .
###8219 you're just a “Utopianist”.
###8221 And the most insidious of them all:
###8223 If you are not for the "free-market"
###8226 you must be against freedom itself.
###8228 I'm a believer in freedom!
###8231 Every time you hear the word 'freedom' being said anywhere
###8233 or 'government interference' said anywhere, it means, decoded:
###8239 .
###8239 blocking maximization of turning money
###8243 into more money for private money possessors.
###8247 That's it. Every other thing they'll say:
###8249 'Oh, we need more commodities for people';
###8251 'Oh, this is freedom against tyranny' and so forth,
###8255 every time you see it, you can decode it down to that.
###8258 And I think you'll find a one-to-one correlation
###8261 with every time they use it.
###8262 And this, in a sense, in which we might call- ...
###8265 It's a Syntax. A governing syntax of understanding and of value.
###8270 So it governs beneath their own recognition of it.
###8273 So they might say: 'Oh, I didn't mean that at all!'
###8276 but in fact, that's what they do.
###8278 Just like you may speak a grammar
###8280 and you have rules of grammar you follow
###8281 without recognizing what the rules are...
###8284 and so what we have is what I call the “Ruling Value Syntax”
###8288 that underlies this. So, every time they use these words:
###8291 'government interference'; 'lack of freedom' or 'freedom'
###8295 or 'progress' or 'development'
###8297 you can decode them all to come back to mean that.
###8302 Of course, when you hear the word 'freedom'
###8305 it tends to be in same sentence with something called 'democracy'.
###8310 .
###8310 It's fascinating how people today seem to believe
###8313 that they actually have a relevant influence
###8315 on what their government does,
###8317 forgetting that the very nature of our system
###8320 offers everything for sale.
###8322 The only vote that counts is the monetary vote
###8325 and it doesn't matter how much any activist
###8327 yells about ethics and accountability.
###8330 In a market system, every politician, every legislation
###8334 and hence, every government- is for sale.
###8338 And even with the $20 trillion bank bailouts starting in 2007-
###8343 .
###8343 an amount of money which could have changed say,
###8346 the global energy infrastructure to fully renewable methods-
###8350 .
###8350 instead going to a series of institutions
###8352 that literally do nothing to help society,
###8355 institutions that could be removed tomorrow with no recourse...
###8359 .
###8359 the blind conditioning that politics and politicians
###8363 exist for the public well-being still continues.
###8368 The fact is, politics is a business,
###8371 no different than any other in a market system,
###8374 and they care about their self-interest before anything else.
###8378 I don't really, honestly, deep down believe in political action.
###8382 I think the system contracts and expands as it wants to.
###8385 It accommodates these changes.
###8387 I think the civil rights movement was an accommodation
###8390 on the part of those who own the country.
###8392 I think they see where their self-interest lies;
###8395 they see a certain amount of freedom seems good
###8397 -an illusion of liberty- give these people a voting day every year
###8401 so that they will have the illusion of meaningless choice.
###8404 Meaningless choice- that we go, like slaves and say
###8407 “Oh, I Voted.” The limits of debate in this country
###8410 are established before the debate even begins
###8412 and everyone else is marginalized and made to seem
###8414 either to be communist or some sort of disloyal person-
###8417 a “kook- there's a word...
###8419 and now it's “conspiracy”. See- they made that
###8421 something that should not be even entertained for a minute:
###8424 that powerful people might get together and have a plan!
###8427 Doesn't happen! You're a “kook”! You're a “conspiracy buff”!
###8433 And of all the mechanisms of defense of this system
###8437 there are two that repeatedly come up.
###8440 The first is this idea that the system has been the “cause”
###8443 of the material progress we have seen on this planet.
###8447 Well...No.
###8449 There are basically two root causes
###8451 which have created the increased so-called “wealth”
###8454 and population growth we see today.
###8457 One: the exponential advancement of production technology;
###8461 hence scientific ingenuity.
###8464 And Two: the initial discovery of abundant hydrocarbon energy-
###8468 which is currently the foundation of the entire socio-economic system.
###8473 The free-market / capitalist / monetary market system
###8476 - whatever you want to call it -
###8477 has done nothing but ride the wave of these advents
###8481 with a distorted incentive system and a haphazard
###8484 grossly unequal method of utilizing and distributing those fruits.
###8490 The second defense is a belligerent social bias
###8493 generated from years of propaganda
###8496 which sees any other social system
###8498 as a route to so called "tyranny”
###8501 with various name droppings of Stalin, Mao, Hitler,
###8505 and the death tolls they generated.
###8507 Well, as despotic as these men might have been
###8510 along with the societal approaches they perpetuated,
###8513 when it comes to the game of death-
###8515 when comes to the systematic
###8517 daily mass murder of human beings-
###8520 nothing in history compares to what we have today.
###8524 Famines- throughout at least the last century of our history-
###8530 have not been caused by a lack of food.
###8532 They have been caused by relative poverty.
###8536 The economic resources were so inequitably distributed
###8540 that the poor simply didn't have enough money
###8543 with which to buy the food that would've been
###8546 available if they could have afforded to pay for it.
###8549 That would be an example of Structural Violence.
###8552 Another example: in Africa and other areas-
###8557 I'll particularly focus on Africa-
###8559 tens of millions of people are dying of AIDS.
###8562 Why are they dying?
###8564 It's not because we don't know how to treat AIDS.
###8567 We have millions of people in the wealthy countries
###8571 getting along remarkably well
###8574 because they have the medicines that will treat it.
###8577 The people in Africa who are dying of AIDS
###8579 are not dying because of the HIV virus.
###8583 They are dying because they don't have the money
###8585 with which to pay for the drugs
###8587 that would keep them alive.
###8589 Gandhi saw this. He said:
###8591 “The deadliest form of violence is poverty.”
###8596 And that's absolutely right.
###8598 Poverty kills far more people than all the wars in history,
###8603 more people than all the murderers in history,
###8605 more than all the suicides in history.
###8608 Not only does Structural Violence kill more people
###8612 than all the Behavioral Violence put together,
###8615 Structural Violence is also the main cause of Behavioral Violence.
###8620 .
###8622 [ Beyond the Peak ]
###8626 Oil is the foundation of
###8630 and is present throughout, the edifice of human civilization.
###8635 There are 10 calories of hydrocarbon energy– oil and natural gas–
###8638 in every calorie of food you and I eat in the industrialized world.
###8643 Fertilizers are made from natural gas.
###8646 Pesticides are made from oil.
###8648 You drive oil-powered machines to plant, plow,
###8650 irrigate, harvest, transport, package.
###8653 You wrap the food in plastic– that's oil. All plastic is oil.
###8656 There are 7 gallons of oil in every tire.
###8659 Oil is everywhere; it's ubiquitous. And it's only because of oil
###8663 that there are 7 billion people or almost
###8665 7 billion people on this planet right now.
###8667 The arrival of this cheap and easy energy
###8670 which is equivalent, by the way,
###8672 to billions of slaves working around the clock,
###8676 changed the world in such a radical way over the last century
###8680 and the population has gone up 10 times.
###8683 But by 2050, oil supply is able to support
###8688 less than half the present world's population
###8690 in their present way of life.
###8692 So, the scale of adjustment to live differently is just enormous.
###8697 The world is now using 6 barrels of oil for every barrel it finds.
###8701 Five years ago it was using 4 barrels of oil
###8703 for every barrel it finds.
###8705 A year from now it is going to be using 8 barrels of oil
###8707 for every barrel of oil it finds.
###8709 What's disturbing to me is the lack of any real effort
###8713 from governments worldwide
###8716 and industry leaders worldwide to do something different.
###8720 We have these, sort of, attempts to build more wind power
###8724 and to maybe do something with Tide...
###8726 we've got attempts to make our cars a little bit more efficient.
###8731 But there's nothing which really looks like a revolution coming along;
###8734 these are all pretty minor, and that I think is pretty frightening.
###8738 .
###8738 And the governments who are driven by these economists
###8742 who don't really appreciate what we're talking about
###8745 are trying to stimulate consumerism to restore past prosperity
###8750 in the hope that they can restore the past.
###8752 They're printing yet more money lacking any collateral at all.
###8756 So, if the economy improves and recovers
###8759 and the famous growth comes back, it will only be short-lived
###8762 because within a short period of time,
###8766 counted in months rather than years,
###8768 it will hit the supply barrier again;
###8771 there will be another price shock and a deeper recession.
###8773 So I think we go into a series of vicious circles.
###8776 .
###8776 So you have the economic growth going up
###8778 -price spike- everything shuts down. That's where we are now.
###8781 Then it starts to come up again but what we have now is this area
###8785 where there's no more ability to produce cheap energy.
###8788 We're at the peak- we're on the down slope of oil production.
###8791 No way you're going to get any more out of the ground any faster
###8795 which means that things shut down, the price of oil drops
###8799 which it did in early 2009 but then as you have a “recovery”
###8805 the price of oil starts to come back.
###8807 It's recently been hovering at about $80 a barrel
###8809 and what we see is that at even at $80 a barrel now,
###8812 with the financial and economic collapse,
###8814 people are having a hard time affording that.
###8816 World oil production right now is about 86 million barrels a day.
###8820 Over 10 years, you're looking at roughly 14 million barrels a day
###8826 having to be replaced.
###8828 There's nothing around which can come even
###8832 within 1% of meeting that sort of demand.
###8835 If we don't do something pretty quickly
###8837 there's going to be a huge energy deficiency.
###8840 I think the big mistake is in not recognizing a decade or so ago
###8846 that a concerted effort needed to be made
###8849 to develop these sustainable forms of energy.
###8851 .
###8851 I think that's something our grandchildren
###8853 will look back on with total disbelief.
###8857 'You people knew you were dealing with a finite commodity.
###8862 How could you possibly have build your economy
###8865 around something which was going to disappear?'
###8869 For the first time in human history
###8871 the species is now faced with the depletion of a core resource
###8875 central to our current system of survival.
###8877 And the punchline of the whole thing
###8879 is that even with oil becoming more scarce
###8882 the economic system will still blindly push
###8885 its cancerous growth model,
###8887 so people can go out and buy more oil powered cars
###8890 to generate GDP and jobs, exacerbating the decline.
###8896 Are there solutions to replace the edifice
###8898 of the hydrocarbon economy? Of course.
###8901 .
###8901 But the path needed to accomplish these changes
###8904 will not manifest through the Market System Protocols required
###8908 since new solutions can only be implemented
###8911 through the Profit Mechanism.
###8913 People are not investing in renewable energies
###8915 because there is no money in it in both long and short term.
###8919 And the commitment needed to make it happen
###8922 can only occur at a severe financial loss.
###8925 Therefore, there is no monetary incentive and in this system,
###8929 if there is no monetary incentive, things do not happen.
###8933 And on top of it all,
###8934 Peak Oil is just one of many surfacing consequences
###8938 of the environmental-social train wreck gaining speed today.
###8943 Other declines include fresh water
###8944 -the very fabric of our existence-
###8947 which is currently showing shortages for 2.8 billion people
###8951 .
###8951 and those shortages are on pace to reach 4 billion by 2030.
###8956 Food Production:
###8957 The destruction of arable crop land,
###8959 from which 99.7% of all human food comes from today
###8964 is occurring up to 40 times faster than it is being replenished.
###8969 And over the last 40 years, 30% of the arable land
###8972 has become unproductive.
###8974 Not to mention that hydrocarbons
###8976 are the backbone of agriculture today
###8978 and, as it declines, so will the food supply.
###8982 As far as resources in general,
###8984 at our current patterns of consumption,
###8986 by 2030 we will need 2 planets to continue our rates.
###8991 Not to mention the continual destruction
###8993 of life supporting biodiversity causing extinction spasms
###8996 .
###8997 and environmental destabilization across the globe.
###9000 And with all of these declines
###9002 we have the near exponential population growth
###9005 where by 2030 there might be over 8 billion people on this planet.
###9010 .
###9010 Energy production alone would need to increase 44%
###9014 by 2030 to meet such demand.
###9017 And again- since money is the only initiator of action,
###9021 are we to expect that any country on the planet
###9024 is going to be able to afford the massive changes
###9027 needed to revolutionize agriculture
###9030 water processing, energy production and the like?
###9033 When the global debt pyramid scheme
###9034 is slowly shutting the entire world down?
###9038 Not to mention the fact that the unemployment you currently see
###9041 .
###9041 is going to become normality, due
###9043 to the nature of technological unemployment.
###9045 The jobs are not coming back.
###9048 And finally, a broad social perspective:
###9051 From the 1970 to 2010, poverty on this planet
###9054 doubled due to this system.
###9057 And given our current state,
###9058 do you honestly think we will see anything less than more doubling,
###9062 .
###9062 more suffering and more mass starvation?
###9066 [ The Beginning ]
###9068 There is not going to be any recovery.
###9071 This is not some long depression
###9073 that we're some day going to pull out of.
###9075 I think the next phase that we are going to see
###9077 after the next round of economic collapses is massive civil unrest.
###9081 When unemployment checks stop being paid
###9083 because the states have no money left.
###9085 And when things get so bad that people lose confidence
###9090 in their elected leaders, they will demand change
###9093 if we don't kill each other in the process
###9096 or destroy the environment.
###9098 I'm just afraid that we might get to the point of no return
###9103 and that bothers me to no end.
###9105 We do all we can to avoid that condition.
###9110 It's clear that we're on the verge of a great transition in human life.
###9116 That what we face now is this fundamental change
###9120 of the life we've known over the last century.
###9123 There has to be a link between the economy
###9126 and the resources of this planet-
###9128 the resources being of course, all animal and plant life,
###9131 the health of the oceans and everything else.
###9135 This is a monetary paradigm that will not let go
###9138 until it's killed the last human being.
###9142 The "in" group will do all it can to stay in power
###9147 and that's what you've got to keep in mind.
###9149 They'll use the army and navy and lies
###9152 or whatever they have to use to keep in power.
###9155 They're not about to give it up
###9157 because they don't know of any other system
###9160 that will perpetuate their kind.
