CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: Hi, my name is Carl
Azuz. Today is December 12th, 2012, and you


2
0:0:6,63 --> 0:0:22,23
are watching CNN STUDENT NEWS.


3
0:0:22,23 --> 0:0:27,8
This is the state Capitol, building in Lansing,
Michigan. There`s a crowd gathered in front,


4
0:0:27,8 --> 0:0:32,279
and this is what that crowd looked like a
close. Protesters, thousands of them, holding


5
0:0:32,279 --> 0:0:36,809
up signs and chanting. At least three schools
around the state were closed, because teachers


6
0:0:36,809 --> 0:0:44,429
went to Lansing to be part of this. The chants
were going on inside the capitol, too.


7
0:0:44,429 --> 0:0:45,989
UNIDENTIFIED MALES AND FEMALES: Veto! Veto!
Veto! Veto!


8
0:0:45,989 --> 0:0:49,179
AZUZ: They are saying, veto, because they
are protesting against legislation, that was


9
0:0:49,179 --> 0:0:53,719
up for a vote yesterday. That legislation
passed, and it was headed to the governor`s


10
0:0:53,719 --> 0:0:59,559
desk next. He said he`ll sign it, and when
he does, Michigan will become the 24th U.S


11
0:0:59,559 --> 0:1:4,449
state with Right-to-Work laws. Now, what that
means is that workers in Michigan won`t have


12
0:1:4,449 --> 0:1:9,979
to join a labor union or to pay union dues
in order to get or keep a job. People who


13
0:1:9,979 --> 0:1:15,2
support these laws say they give workers more
choice and can attract more business. Critics


14
0:1:15,2 --> 0:1:19,369
say that right-to-work laws make unions weaker
and keep wages lower.


15
0:1:19,369 --> 0:1:24,659
Nelson Mandela, political activist, world
leader, Nobel Peace Prize winner, here`s Mandela


16
0:1:24,659 --> 0:1:30,84
at the U.S. Capitol building in 1990 and this
is where Mandela was yesterday, a hospital


17
0:1:30,84 --> 0:1:35,7
in his home country of South Africa, checked
in there over the weekend. Authorities say


18
0:1:35,7 --> 0:1:40,43
doctors were treating the 94-year old for
a lung infection. Mandela had abdominal surgery


19
0:1:40,43 --> 0:1:46,9
earlier this year and had a serious respiratory
infection last year. Nelson Mandela was once


20
0:1:46,9 --> 0:1:52,52
called the world`s most famous political prisoner.
He spent 27 years in jail, fighting for equality


21
0:1:52,52 --> 0:1:57,95
for black South Africans. After he was released
in 1990, he continued his efforts to unite


22
0:1:57,95 --> 0:2:4,229
his country. His work earned him that Nobel
Peace Prize and in 1994, he won South Africa`s


23
0:2:4,229 --> 0:2:8,75
first open election, becoming the country`s
first black president.


24
0:2:8,75 --> 0:2:16,92
Is this legit? "Zwolf, doce and dvenadzat`
all represent the number twelve.


25
0:2:16,92 --> 0:2:24,8
Yep, in order, those are the German, Spanish
and Russian words for 12.


26
0:2:24,8 --> 0:2:31,51
Well, considering today`s date, 12/12/12,
we thought we`d get in on the fun, so with


27
0:2:31,51 --> 0:2:36,67
the year winding down, we are going to take
a look back at 12 newsmakers from the past


28
0:2:36,67 --> 0:2:42,459
12 months.


29
0:2:42,459 --> 0:2:51,159
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


30
0:2:51,159 --> 0:3:2,75
CROWD (chanting): Huria! Huria!


31
0:3:2,75 --> 0:3:28,1
AUNG SAN SUU KYI, ACTIVIST AND POLITICAL LEADER:
We hope that this will be the beginning of


32
0:3:28,1 --> 0:3:34,18
new era where there will be more emphasis
on the role of the people in the everyday


33
0:3:34,18 --> 0:3:41,92
politics of our country.


34
0:3:41,92 --> 0:4:30,3
MICHAEL PHELPS, AMERICAN SWIMMING CHAMPION:
I finished my career how I wanted to. Now,


35
0:4:30,3 --> 0:4:47,65
looking back, I can (inaudible) everything
I`ve ever wanted to.


36
0:4:47,65 --> 0:4:50,34
MALALA YOUSUFZAI, PAKISTANI TEENAGER: I thought
that I must stand up for my rights, the right


37
0:4:50,34 --> 0:4:53,82
of education, the right for peace.


38
0:4:53,82 --> 0:5:1,93
FELIX BAUMGARTNER, AUSTRIAN SKYDIVER: (inaudible)


39
0:5:1,93 --> 0:5:11,66
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: 725. (cheering and applause)


40
0:5:11,66 --> 0:5:21,389
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: ... the world record holder.


41
0:5:21,389 --> 0:5:33,16
MITT ROMNEY, FORMER GOVERNOR OF MASSACHUSETTS:
This is the time of great challenges for America,


42
0:5:33,16 --> 0:5:39,449
and I pray that the president will be successful
in guiding our nation.


43
0:5:39,449 --> 0:5:52,71
BARACK OBAMA, U.S. PRESIDENT: With your stories
and your struggles, I return to the White


44
0:5:52,71 --> 0:5:58,68
House more determined and more inspired than
ever about the work there is to do and the


45
0:5:58,68 --> 0:6:0,569
future that lies ahead.


46
0:6:0,569 --> 0:6:1,5
(applause)


47
0:6:1,5 --> 0:6:2,47
(END VIDEO CLIP)


48
0:6:2,47 --> 0:6:3,889
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


49
0:6:3,889 --> 0:6:8,639
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Today`s "Shoutout" goes
out to Mrs. Marx`s social studies classes


50
0:6:8,639 --> 0:6:15,4
in Freeland, Michigan. Which of these professional
sports leagues plays an 82-game season? You


51
0:6:15,4 --> 0:6:21,36
know what to do, is it Major League Soccer,
National Football League, Major League Baseball


52
0:6:21,36 --> 0:6:25,25
or National Hockey League? You`ve got three
seconds, go.


53
0:6:25,25 --> 0:6:39,55
In a standard NHL season, teams plays 82 games.
That`s your answer and that`s your "Shoutout."


54
0:6:39,55 --> 0:6:42,229
(END VIDEO CLIP)


55
0:6:42,229 --> 0:6:47,569
AZUZ: But so far this season, NHL teams haven`t
played any games, and they are not going to


56
0:6:47,569 --> 0:6:51,43
for at least a few more weeks. All those games
have been canceled through the end of the


57
0:6:51,43 --> 0:6:57,389
year, the all star game scrapped. This year`s
outdoor winter classic game, gone, all because


58
0:6:57,389 --> 0:7:1,449
of a labor dispute between the league and
its players. And two sides are trying to work


59
0:7:1,449 --> 0:7:6,21
out a new deal. It would include things like
how players contracts are set up, and how


60
0:7:6,21 --> 0:7:11,86
long those contracts can last. Eight years
ago, a similar dispute led to the entire NHL


61
0:7:11,86 --> 0:7:14,11
season being canceled.


62
0:7:14,11 --> 0:7:17,71
Kareem Abdul Jabbar set a lot of records in
the basketball court. But the Hall of Famer


63
0:7:17,71 --> 0:7:22,66
has also said, quote, "I can do more than
stuff a ball through a hoop. My greatest asset


64
0:7:22,66 --> 0:7:26,84
is my mind." He is hoping his new foundation
will send the same message to young people.


65
0:7:26,84 --> 0:7:27,379
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


66
0:7:27,379 --> 0:7:30,9
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR, NBA PLAYER 1969-89: We
are trying to get the Skyhoop Foundation off


67
0:7:30,9 --> 0:7:33,96
the ground and set up to give kids a shot
that can`t be blocked, and that has to do


68
0:7:33,96 --> 0:7:39,69
with their education, no matter what happens
to a young person, if they have good educational


69
0:7:39,69 --> 0:7:42,78
foundation, they can do what they want to
do with their lives.


70
0:7:42,78 --> 0:7:45,629
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Education, it`s very important
to you.


71
0:7:45,629 --> 0:7:50,9
ABDUL-JABBAR: Yes, it is. Too many young people
think that the only thing that they can do


72
0:7:50,9 --> 0:7:58,27
is be LeBron James or Denzel Washington or
Jay-Z, and if they can`t do that, they are


73
0:7:58,27 --> 0:8:0,78
lost. That`s not it.


74
0:8:0,78 --> 0:8:6,99
Any kid that wants to grow up and be me is
facing incredible odds, there are only 450


75
0:8:6,99 --> 0:8:13,39
NBA jobs available for athletes. That`s it.
We live in a country of many millions of people


76
0:8:13,39 --> 0:8:19,139
and there are 450 jobs of that type. So, most
kids are not going to make it. Because if


77
0:8:19,139 --> 0:8:25,9
they just do the math, it would become very
obvious to them, but they all use the exception


78
0:8:25,9 --> 0:8:30,9
as a rule. We need to flip that around and
give them an idea of what they want to do.


79
0:8:30,9 --> 0:8:32,93
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There`s kids watching right
now that think I`m going to be the next Kareem


80
0:8:32,93 --> 0:8:37,5
Abdul Jabbar. I`m going to be the greatest
basketball player ever. Your advice to them


81
0:8:37,5 --> 0:8:37,45
is what?


82
0:8:37,45 --> 0:8:41,47
ABDUL-JABBAR: Dream your dreams, pursue your
dreams, but don`t have that to be the only


83
0:8:41,47 --> 0:8:47,47
thing that you pursue. I`m going to still
a quote from the United Negro College Fund,


84
0:8:47,47 --> 0:8:53,3
"A mind is a terrible thing to waste," don`t
let your intellectual development suffer because


85
0:8:53,3 --> 0:8:55,84
you want to play sports. You can do the both.


86
0:8:55,84 --> 0:8:56,43
(END VIDEOTAPE)


87
0:8:56,43 --> 0:9:1,1
AZUZ: Well, finally today sometimes it`s all
about the details: This man from Washington


88
0:9:1,1 --> 0:9:5,79
State decided to go big when it came time
to propose to his girlfriend. No simple down


89
0:9:5,79 --> 0:9:12,22
on one knee and ask business. This guy used
his tractor to plow his proposal into a 200


90
0:9:12,22 --> 0:9:18,75
acre field. Then he flew his intended fiancee
Jody over it in an airplane. There was just


91
0:9:18,75 --> 0:9:24,75
one problem: the Jay in Jody was facing the
wrong way, so, you could give him an A for


92
0:9:24,75 --> 0:9:30,66
romance and F for handwriting. His little
slip up didn`t distract her from the question


93
0:9:30,66 --> 0:9:34,54
at hand, and she said, yes. There are a lot
of ways to propose, you could go with type


94
0:9:34,54 --> 0:9:39,13
A, or type B, that guy went with type O. Still,
they decide to write their own vows. He might


95
0:9:39,13 --> 0:9:43,82
want to leave that to his bride. We`ve plowed
through all our time for today, more stories


96
0:9:43,82 --> 0:11:43,82
and more puns cropping up tomorrow on CNN
STUDENT NEWS. See you then.
