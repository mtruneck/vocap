###10 Pasta compomodori. It's
###13 basic, basic tomato sauce. The basis of lots of Italian recipes. It is classic.
###21 We are going to show you two different directions
###23 One is gonna be arrabiata and then the other one is tuna and capers
###27 
###29 Onions and garlic and tinned tomatoes are your base
###33 Ems, you're on the onions. I'm going to chop the garlic
###38 My trick with garlic is I put a bit of salt on it and it releases all the juices
###43 
###44 Look at all that moisture
###47 That's the salt that's released that. It makes it really easy to crush
###50 with a flat blade. A nice glug of olive oil. Heat it up
###55 Ready? Yup
###59 We've got a lovely mix of different sized onions in there. Authentic.
###67 In theory you'd have them all diced nice and fine. Garlic wants to go in a little bit later because
###72 you don't want it to burn, the garlic cooks much quicker than the onion's. Ems
###76 will you open the tin of tomatoes. Make sure they're chopped
###79 Mum's shown us how to do this.
###81 It just saves you pulling them out and chopping them. There we go nice chopped tomatoes
###88 Look at that!
###90 Because there's a lot of liquid in there we also cheat with the stock.
###95 Crumble that stock in and it will dissolve
###97 Trust me!
###99 It does the job, it really does.
###102 There's some bigger chunks of tomatoes there. Just bash it down with your spoon
###107 Put some salt and pepper in them
###108 and then pepper anchino, which is cayenne pepper. Not enough to make it spicy.
###113 It should just give it a little heat
###116 That is a classic tomato sauce. I'm just going to have a little taste. I'll have a little taste too please.
###120 Leave it to simmer as it is, for about 15 minutes but that's pretty much
###124 the same time as your pasta's going to cook
###127 Mum would literally make this in vats
###130 Do you want to come and have a little look?
###132 This is where she stores all the essentials
###134 Italian tuna, Italian pasta. Here we go.
###136 Come September they'll
###139 probably be 15 of these and these are brilliant because they're
###143 like little bricks, they're perfect for two people. You can pop that straight into
###147 a pan
###148 from frozen, ten minutes on the heat? Mum's going to hate the fact that we're in here. Don't tell her!
###153 Come on, take a look at our pasta store cupboard  essentials video.
###157 Just click on the link below
###162 So we're going to split this sauce and show you arrabiata, which is
###166 spicy, a bit like a pesto, really versatile. Let's put our pasta in because that's
###171 going to take ten minutes
###173 So this pasta that we're using here is fusilli.
###175 All those little twists
###179 really mop up the sauce, and you'll have gooey tomato sauce running
###183 through that pasta.
###185 Chop up some pancetta now
###188 So that's nice and warm
###190 You don't need any oil
###192 because this pancetta will just, it's got enough fat in it
###196 If you say you're arrabiata you're cross, you're angry, they call it that because it's
###202 fiery and
###204 spicy
###207 You don't want to get rid of that fat because it's full of
###209 flavour and saltiness and it's
###212 really good
###213 Look at those bits
###214 Nice and crispy and delicious
###219 If you're going to have an arrabiatta you want it nice and hot. Half a teaspoon of chilli flakes
###224 As you can see it's quite meaty
###226 thick sauce now.
###228 Just before I put the pasta in there I'm going to add a little bit of the pasta water.
###234 Come on Em's. I'm ready. We want 50/50 yeah?
###238 Marry the pasta on the heat.
###241 Always
###244 This one's your spicy Arrabiata
###247 And then the other one is really simple we loved it as kids
###250 tuna and capers
###252 My tuna's gone in
###255 Capers will give it a little bit of saltiness and it goes really really well with
###259 the fish
###260 After our swimming lessons when we were kids, instead of going to the fish and chip shop like everyone else,
###263 we went home for a plate of pasta with tuna
###268 I want a drizzle of olive oil
###271 I'm going, I'm not waiting for you.
###275 I want parmesan on mine too.
###283 Yup, really good
###285 Chilli?
###286 Yup, it's got a hit. It's good.
###290 Ohhh, everytime
###291 You can try some of mine
