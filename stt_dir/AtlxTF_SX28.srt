SHANE SMITH: When I was a kid,
I always want to take the


5
0:0:15,98 --> 0:0:18,95
Trans-Siberian because it
seemed so far away, and


6
0:0:18,95 --> 0:0:20,76
romantic, and freaky.


7
0:0:20,76 --> 0:0:23,25
I imagined Tartars and
Mongolians cooking in their


8
0:0:23,25 --> 0:0:26,64
cabins and trading with Turkmen
and Uyghurs for rare


9
0:0:26,64 --> 0:0:27,48
and delicate silks.


10
0:0:27,48 --> 0:0:30,96

trees, lots of trees,


11
0:0:30,96 --> 0:0:33,64
interspersed with rotten
industrial wastelands and


12
0:0:33,64 --> 0:0:36,35
peppered with some failed
Stalinist industry--


13
0:0:36,35 --> 0:0:38,96
and then, of course, more
and more trees.


14
0:0:38,96 --> 0:0:41,76
