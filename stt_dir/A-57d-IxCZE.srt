STEVE SPANGLER: All right,
it's Thanksgiving.


3
0:0:1,19 --> 0:0:4,2
This is going to be a very cool
episode, because you are


4
0:0:4,2 --> 0:0:7,63
going to use common household
items to do amazing things for


5
0:0:7,63 --> 0:0:8,69
your friends.


6
0:0:8,69 --> 0:0:9,64
You're going to amaze them.


7
0:0:9,64 --> 0:0:10,562
I just know it.

[THEME MUSIC PLAYING]


9
0:0:12,41 --> 0:0:14,43
STEVE SPANGLER: I'm Steve
Spangler, and I'm all about


10
0:0:14,43 --> 0:0:15,85
making science fun.


11
0:0:15,85 --> 0:0:18,48
For the last 20 years, I've
been teaching ways to turn


12
0:0:18,48 --> 0:0:21,49
ordinary science experiments
into unforgettable learning


13
0:0:21,49 --> 0:0:22,5
experiences.


14
0:0:22,5 --> 0:0:25,14
I have an amazing team who will
do whatever it takes to


15
0:0:25,14 --> 0:0:27,88
affect the way people
think about science.


16
0:0:27,88 --> 0:0:30,17
And to do that, I live
by one motto--


17
0:0:30,17 --> 0:0:33,13
make it big, do it right,
give it class.


18
0:0:33,13 --> 0:0:39,32



19
0:0:39,32 --> 0:0:41,57
Just finished that great
Thanksgiving meal.


20
0:0:41,57 --> 0:0:43,54
Boy, am I full.


21
0:0:43,54 --> 0:0:47,285
So the deal is this-- there's
lots of toothpicks around.


22
0:0:47,285 --> 0:0:49,61
And if you're like 80 years old,
you know what this is,


23
0:0:49,61 --> 0:0:51,42
but if you're a little kid you
don't even know why they even


24
0:0:51,42 --> 0:0:52,78
use toothpicks.


25
0:0:52,78 --> 0:0:54,13
For science experiments.


26
0:0:54,13 --> 0:0:56,25
Here's what you're going to do--
you're going to bend some


27
0:0:56,25 --> 0:0:58,17
toothpicks like this, and you're
going to form them into


28
0:0:58,17 --> 0:0:59,49
the shape of a star.


29
0:0:59,49 --> 0:1:2,56
This is what we want our little
project to look like,


30
0:1:2,56 --> 0:1:5,65
but the toothpicks actually have
to start out on a plate


31
0:1:5,65 --> 0:1:6,59
like this right here.


32
0:1:6,59 --> 0:1:10,5
And without touching it, you
turn it from this into this.


33
0:1:10,5 --> 0:1:11,572
How do you do that?


34
0:1:11,572 --> 0:1:12,46
I'll show you.


35
0:1:12,46 --> 0:1:13,71
Watch.


36
0:1:13,71 --> 0:1:16,77



37
0:1:16,77 --> 0:1:17,88
It didn't work.


38
0:1:17,88 --> 0:1:20,6
Since that last strategy clearly
did not work, we're


39
0:1:20,6 --> 0:1:21,84
making another one.


40
0:1:21,84 --> 0:1:23,99
So notice how you break it just
like this, not all the


41
0:1:23,99 --> 0:1:24,52
way through.


42
0:1:24,52 --> 0:1:27,87
This completes a last little
piece right here.


43
0:1:27,87 --> 0:1:30,74
So the object is to go from
here and to make it


44
0:1:30,74 --> 0:1:31,88
open up as a star.


45
0:1:31,88 --> 0:1:33,86
Believe it or not, the
secret is a straw.


46
0:1:33,86 --> 0:1:36,46
And you're going to put the
straw down in some water, and


47
0:1:36,46 --> 0:1:38,55
put your finger in the end,
and pick up just a


48
0:1:38,55 --> 0:1:39,33
little bit of water.


49
0:1:39,33 --> 0:1:41,58
You don't want much at all--
just a couple drops.


50
0:1:41,58 --> 0:1:43,69
It goes right into the
middle-- watch.


51
0:1:43,69 --> 0:1:51,402



52
0:1:51,402 --> 0:1:54,25
It's not that the water just
pushed out the toothpicks, but


53
0:1:54,25 --> 0:1:56,77
instead the toothpicks
absorbed the water.


54
0:1:56,77 --> 0:1:58,83
And when it absorbs the water,
the little capillaries that


55
0:1:58,83 --> 0:2:2,2
make up the wood literally
went from this to


56
0:2:2,2 --> 0:2:3,43
pushing back out again.


57
0:2:3,43 --> 0:2:7,39
And in doing so, it literally
just pushed those pieces out


58
0:2:7,39 --> 0:2:8,65
to form the little star.


59
0:2:8,65 --> 0:2:10,65
So you might want to practice
and try some different


60
0:2:10,65 --> 0:2:12,92
things-- some different kinds
of liquid, maybe different


61
0:2:12,92 --> 0:2:15,6
kinds and styles of toothpick
to be able to


62
0:2:15,6 --> 0:2:15,785
get your best burst.


63
0:2:15,785 --> 0:2:19,5
But once you've got it, hoard
the toothpicks, because you're


64
0:2:19,5 --> 0:2:20,32
going to want to
do it forever.


65
0:2:20,32 --> 0:2:22,53
It's pretty cool.


66
0:2:22,53 --> 0:2:24,63
This little trick is going to
teach all those people who


67
0:2:24,63 --> 0:2:26,6
give you more silverware
than you need at your


68
0:2:26,6 --> 0:2:27,54
fancy little dinner.


69
0:2:27,54 --> 0:2:29,37
You know how they always
give you two forks?


70
0:2:29,37 --> 0:2:31,37
Well, snag one of them, because
you're going to need


71
0:2:31,37 --> 0:2:33,5
two of them at the very
end of the meal.


72
0:2:33,5 --> 0:2:36,2
And you're going to need
to have a water glass.


73
0:2:36,2 --> 0:2:38,12
And a toothpick.


74
0:2:38,12 --> 0:2:39,82
So here's what the
challenge is.


75
0:2:39,82 --> 0:2:44,14
You need to balance these forks
on the rim of the glass,


76
0:2:44,14 --> 0:2:45,46
using just this toothpick.


77
0:2:45,46 --> 0:2:47,66
And you can't break
the glass, and you


78
0:2:47,66 --> 0:2:49,65
can't use Gorilla Glue.


79
0:2:49,65 --> 0:2:51,1
That's pretty much everything.


80
0:2:51,1 --> 0:2:52,3
Well, and magnets.


81
0:2:52,3 --> 0:2:54,1
And you can't use duct tape--


82
0:2:54,1 --> 0:2:55,415
for sure not duct tape.


83
0:2:55,415 --> 0:3:0,56
You can't use Elmer's glue,
Superglue, c-clamps, radiator


84
0:3:0,56 --> 0:3:2,52
hose clamps--


85
0:3:2,52 --> 0:3:5,17
any other things like that.


86
0:3:5,17 --> 0:3:6,82
That's what you can't use.


87
0:3:6,82 --> 0:3:9,31
You just can use the
toothpick and this.


88
0:3:9,31 --> 0:3:11,27
And your brain.


89
0:3:11,27 --> 0:3:12,18
So here's the secret.


90
0:3:12,18 --> 0:3:14,37
You're going to jam
these little tines


91
0:3:14,37 --> 0:3:15,78
together, like that.


92
0:3:15,78 --> 0:3:19,87
So this is what you're looking
for, this little system.


93
0:3:19,87 --> 0:3:22,48
And then it's going to take a
little work, but you're going


94
0:3:22,48 --> 0:3:28,89
to try to get the toothpick
in through both sides.


95
0:3:28,89 --> 0:3:31,88
I've got an opening here at the
top that you can just work


96
0:3:31,88 --> 0:3:34,9
the toothpick in a little bit
more, and you've got it.


97
0:3:34,9 --> 0:3:35,95
So here's what we're
going to try to do.


98
0:3:35,95 --> 0:3:39,8
We're going to try to rest this
on the edge of the glass.


99
0:3:39,8 --> 0:3:44,4
The trick here is to get the
center of gravity down below


100
0:3:44,4 --> 0:3:45,97
that balance point
right there.


101
0:3:45,97 --> 0:3:49,49
So the object here is to balance
it on the glass.


102
0:3:49,49 --> 0:3:51,86
It's going to go to
the very edge.


103
0:3:51,86 --> 0:3:53,7
And you've got it.


104
0:3:53,7 --> 0:3:54,32
A lot of people think
it's done.


105
0:3:54,32 --> 0:3:56,61
No, it's not done, because
now we introduce


106
0:3:56,61 --> 0:3:58,86
the element of fire.


107
0:3:58,86 --> 0:4:0,56
Watch.


108
0:4:0,56 --> 0:4:5,75
See, you burn this part here,
and you burn this part over


109
0:4:5,75 --> 0:4:11,48
here, and here comes
pending disaster.


110
0:4:11,48 --> 0:4:14,9
You'll notice that the stick
stopped burning the moment it


111
0:4:14,9 --> 0:4:15,7
got to the glass.


112
0:4:15,7 --> 0:4:18,69
That's because the glass-- the
rim of the glass absorbed that


113
0:4:18,69 --> 0:4:21,76
heat energy away from the wood
and caused it to go out.


114
0:4:21,76 --> 0:4:23,78
Same thing with the
metal over here.


115
0:4:23,78 --> 0:4:25,53
It absorbs that heat energy.


116
0:4:25,53 --> 0:4:28,61
So it just naturally goes out,
burns everything to the very


117
0:4:28,61 --> 0:4:31,39
end, because the real support is
only at that one point, and


118
0:4:31,39 --> 0:4:34,93
you have a system that is
in perfect balance.


119
0:4:34,93 --> 0:4:38,49
And a trick that's guaranteed
to amaze your friends.


120
0:4:38,49 --> 0:4:40,42
It's pretty good.


121
0:4:40,42 --> 0:4:42,69
So this one, you're going to
need to have some money-- a


122
0:4:42,69 --> 0:4:43,83
couple nickels.


123
0:4:43,83 --> 0:4:46,57
So clear an area on the table,
put the nickel on the table,


124
0:4:46,57 --> 0:4:50,17
put the other nickel so it's
perpendicular, like this.


125
0:4:50,17 --> 0:4:52,2
And of course, the theme
today, toothpicks--


126
0:4:52,2 --> 0:4:53,7
so you're going to
need to have that


127
0:4:53,7 --> 0:4:55,11
toothpick right there.


128
0:4:55,11 --> 0:4:58,3
You're going to try to balance
the toothpick right on the


129
0:4:58,3 --> 0:5:0,47
edge like that.


130
0:5:0,47 --> 0:5:3,46
I can kick it over just
a little bit more.


131
0:5:3,46 --> 0:5:4,89
Balance it just like that.


132
0:5:4,89 --> 0:5:8,11
Now, the object is to move the
toothpick, but you can't touch


133
0:5:8,11 --> 0:5:8,71
the toothpick.


134
0:5:8,71 --> 0:5:11,29
And the problem is, it's so
precariously balanced that


135
0:5:11,29 --> 0:5:13,92
just breathing on it would move
it, so that's where the


136
0:5:13,92 --> 0:5:15,0
cup comes in.


137
0:5:15,0 --> 0:5:18,37
Because now you cover the whole
thing with the cup, and


138
0:5:18,37 --> 0:5:23,25
now, without touching the glass,
the object is to move


139
0:5:23,25 --> 0:5:24,42
the toothpick.


140
0:5:24,42 --> 0:5:25,87
How would you do it?


141
0:5:25,87 --> 0:5:27,51
The secret--


142
0:5:27,51 --> 0:5:28,89
a balloon.


143
0:5:28,89 --> 0:5:30,14
Blow it up.


144
0:5:30,14 --> 0:5:35,9



145
0:5:35,9 --> 0:5:37,54
Now you're not going to pop
the balloon and cause that


146
0:5:37,54 --> 0:5:38,79
burst to move it.


147
0:5:38,79 --> 0:5:41,34
You're actually going to use
something as simple as static


148
0:5:41,34 --> 0:5:43,36
electricity.


149
0:5:43,36 --> 0:5:45,14
So you're just going to build
up some static electricity


150
0:5:45,14 --> 0:5:46,6
here-- that's about right.


151
0:5:46,6 --> 0:5:48,54
Now we're going to take that
over and get it close to the


152
0:5:48,54 --> 0:5:50,37
toothpick, and watch.


153
0:5:50,37 --> 0:5:55,18
So you're just trying to
discharge the electrons in the


154
0:5:55,18 --> 0:6:0,3
balloon, and these electrons
literally are able to push


155
0:6:0,3 --> 0:6:4,24
that stick around, and to move
it in such a way until it


156
0:6:4,24 --> 0:6:6,72
finally discharges.


157
0:6:6,72 --> 0:6:9,146
But it totally looks like
magic, doesn't it?


158
0:6:9,146 --> 0:6:12,93
And very cool how you can move
it even under the glass.


159
0:6:12,93 --> 0:6:15,57
Now, even with the glass
off, you can try it.


160
0:6:15,57 --> 0:6:16,96
Try different kinds
of glasses.


161
0:6:16,96 --> 0:6:19,6
See whether or not plastic is
the only thing that you can


162
0:6:19,6 --> 0:6:24,42
use, or whether or not
an actual glass


163
0:6:24,42 --> 0:6:25,82
container will work.


164
0:6:25,82 --> 0:6:29,44
It's ridiculously cool, and it
almost looks like magic.


165
0:6:29,44 --> 0:6:30,25
Secret?


166
0:6:30,25 --> 0:6:31,28

slide creates a vibration.

Here's what I'm going to ask you
do, is find two glasses.


190
0:7:9,86 --> 0:7:11,93
Start with them identical.


191
0:7:11,93 --> 0:7:14,95
That's usually not hard, since
you buy them in a set, right?


192
0:7:14,95 --> 0:7:17,26
And try to get them so they're
exactly the same sound.


193
0:7:17,26 --> 0:7:19,9
We're going to try to make
this so it's sympathetic.


194
0:7:19,9 --> 0:7:22,0
We'd like to have the vibration
from one go


195
0:7:22,0 --> 0:7:22,83
to the other one.

going to vibrate.


199
0:7:29,38 --> 0:7:30,98
Take the other glass.


200
0:7:30,98 --> 0:7:31,62
Vibrate it.


201

Get it close, but not close
enough to touch, and see

However, a little
experimentation, which now

turns this into a real
experiment and not just a

two different glasses.


228
0:8:21,72 --> 0:8:23,8

still move, because it's not


243

about the volume of the water
or the size of the glass.


244
0:8:52,9 --> 0:8:56,35
It's about the frequency of the
tone that you're creating.


245

That energy is literally
transferring from one


246
0:8:59,15 --> 0:9:0,77

247
0:9:0,77 --> 0:9:2,71
Look at that toothpick move.


248

It's all because we tried to
experiment and prove something

end of any good meal?

253
0:9:16,96 --> 0:9:17,44
No.

0:9:17,44 --> 0:9:19,47
Even though you've just amazed
everyone with your little


255
0:9:19,47 --> 0:9:21,78
toothpick tricks, you
offer to clean up.


256
0:9:21,78 --> 0:9:25,12
But you always start with the
tablecloth, because that's


257
0:9:25,12 --> 0:9:26,4
what's dirty first.


258
0:9:26,4 --> 0:9:30,13
So you just take the tablecloth
like this, and--


259
0:9:30,13 --> 0:9:30,99
perfect.


260
0:9:30,99 --> 0:9:34,68
Now you can wipe your mouth,
and you're ready to go.


261
0:9:34,68 --> 0:9:38,2



262
0:9:38,2 --> 0:9:39,56
All right, you want
to learn how to do


263
0:9:39,56 --> 0:9:40,56
the tablecloth trick.


264
0:9:40,56 --> 0:9:43,52
It's actually very cool, and
one of the secrets is


265
0:9:43,52 --> 0:9:44,85
selecting the right
tablecloth.


266
0:9:44,85 --> 0:9:47,76
Now most tablecloths that people
use are nice, and they


267
0:9:47,76 --> 0:9:48,21
don't work.


268
0:9:48,21 --> 0:9:51,24
And the reason they don't work
is because they have a hem.


269
0:9:51,24 --> 0:9:52,69
Look at this one here.


270
0:9:52,69 --> 0:9:54,4
There's no hem.


271
0:9:54,4 --> 0:9:57,1
See, I just literally
cut the edges off.


272
0:9:57,1 --> 0:9:59,5
This means that it gets to be a
little frayed after a while,


273
0:9:59,5 --> 0:10:1,1
and it's not very pretty.


274
0:10:1,1 --> 0:10:3,14
But this is exactly what we
want, because we don't want


275
0:10:3,14 --> 0:10:6,0
there to be any bump or anything
that would interrupt


276
0:10:6,0 --> 0:10:7,44
the flow of the cloth.


277
0:10:7,44 --> 0:10:9,9
When you learn how to do the
tablecloth trick, you're


278
0:10:9,9 --> 0:10:11,51
learning about the laws of
inertia, or the tendency of an


279
0:10:11,51 --> 0:10:15,24
object to stay at rest until
a force acts upon it.


280
0:10:15,24 --> 0:10:17,22
Thanks, Newton.


281
0:10:17,22 --> 0:10:19,5
It starts with a little
bit of practice.


282
0:10:19,5 --> 0:10:20,41
You start this way.


283
0:10:20,41 --> 0:10:23,84
Now, I've got a piece of cloth
here that's probably 1 meter


284
0:10:23,84 --> 0:10:26,97
by 1 meter, so almost
a yard by a yard.


285
0:10:26,97 --> 0:10:29,22
You're going to practice doing
this-- you lay it out on the


286
0:10:29,22 --> 0:10:31,84
table, and your hands, I
think, are the secret.


287
0:10:31,84 --> 0:10:33,49
Because you hold the
cloth like this.


288
0:10:33,49 --> 0:10:37,11
I actually fold it up a little
bit in my hands and hang it


289
0:10:37,11 --> 0:10:38,52
over the edge like this.


290
0:10:38,52 --> 0:10:40,28
I never go above the table.


291
0:10:40,28 --> 0:10:41,42
I'm going to start
below the table.


292
0:10:41,42 --> 0:10:44,18
It forces me to pull
straight down.


293
0:10:44,18 --> 0:10:47,17
You pull straight down
to your toes.


294
0:10:47,17 --> 0:10:48,76
So you can hear the
whipping sound.


295
0:10:48,76 --> 0:10:49,81
Listen to this, listen.


296
0:10:49,81 --> 0:10:50,86
[WHIPPING SOUND]


297
0:10:50,86 --> 0:10:52,37
STEVE SPANGLER: That's what
you're looking for.


298
0:10:52,37 --> 0:10:53,92
Practice that a couple times.


299
0:10:53,92 --> 0:10:56,37
All right, a hundred times,
I don't care.


300
0:10:56,37 --> 0:10:58,53
But if you don't practice
this, you're going to be


301
0:10:58,53 --> 0:11:0,2
ruining some dishes.


302
0:11:0,2 --> 0:11:1,38
Second thing--


303
0:11:1,38 --> 0:11:2,56
the dishes.


304
0:11:2,56 --> 0:11:4,57
Notice how this is smooth
on the bottom.


305
0:11:4,57 --> 0:11:7,96
You're going to run to garage
sales and try to find dishes


306
0:11:7,96 --> 0:11:9,64
that are smooth here
on the bottom.


307
0:11:9,64 --> 0:11:12,18
If they're rough or they have--
the more expensive they


308
0:11:12,18 --> 0:11:14,362
are, probably the more rough
they're going to be, with a


309
0:11:14,362 --> 0:11:15,82
little edge, and you
don't want those.


310
0:11:15,82 --> 0:11:18,34
So this nice and smooth will
be perfect, because we want


311
0:11:18,34 --> 0:11:20,85
very little friction between
the cloth and the dishes.


312
0:11:20,85 --> 0:11:23,56
So that when you're pulling the
cloth out from underneath,


313
0:11:23,56 --> 0:11:24,81
then it slides very easily.


314
0:11:24,81 --> 0:11:29,16
So find dishes that have no
little things that will grab


315
0:11:29,16 --> 0:11:31,495
on the bottom, and this'll
be perfect.


316
0:11:31,495 --> 0:11:34,56



317
0:11:34,56 --> 0:11:36,28
Third part, the glasses.


318
0:11:36,28 --> 0:11:39,33
I like to call these the
convincer, because glasses by


319
0:11:39,33 --> 0:11:42,14
themselves are perfect,
especially when you take water


320
0:11:42,14 --> 0:11:44,4
and you fill these with water.


321
0:11:44,4 --> 0:11:46,47
What you're actually doing,
believe it or not, is making


322
0:11:46,47 --> 0:11:49,71
it easier on yourself, because
you're increasing the mass.


323
0:11:49,71 --> 0:11:51,8
See, once you increase the
mass, you increase the


324
0:11:51,8 --> 0:11:55,22
inertia, or the tendency of an
object to stay at rest until


325
0:11:55,22 --> 0:11:57,1
some sort of force
acts upon it.


326
0:11:57,1 --> 0:11:59,3
The force here-- gravity
pulling down.


327
0:11:59,3 --> 0:12:2,9
Of course, the table below,
supporting it, so there's no


328
0:12:2,9 --> 0:12:3,17
movement at all.


329
0:12:3,17 --> 0:12:6,68
And hopefully, we can slip
the tablecloth right out.


330
0:12:6,68 --> 0:12:9,2
Other things you're going to
need-- forks, of course, find


331
0:12:9,2 --> 0:12:10,2
a knife, spoon.


332
0:12:10,2 --> 0:12:12,4
The only thing that you
don't want to use--


333
0:12:12,4 --> 0:12:13,69
wineglasses.


334
0:12:13,69 --> 0:12:16,44
See, they're too heavy on the
top, and so a wineglass can


335
0:12:16,44 --> 0:12:17,7
fairly easily tip over.


336
0:12:17,7 --> 0:12:20,67
You might find one that works
well, but for me, this seems


337
0:12:20,67 --> 0:12:22,43
to be the perfect setup.


338
0:12:22,43 --> 0:12:26,7
Remember, straight down, and
notice that I didn't put a lot


339
0:12:26,7 --> 0:12:27,57
of the tablecloth over there.


340
0:12:27,57 --> 0:12:30,24
As I'm practicing, I'm going
to set this off to the side


341
0:12:30,24 --> 0:12:33,32
like this and allow the edge
to sneak out first.


342
0:12:33,32 --> 0:12:35,28
It just makes it a little bit
easier as you're starting.


343
0:12:35,28 --> 0:12:36,83
Right straight down to your
toes, watch this--


344
0:12:36,83 --> 0:12:39,9
three, two--


345
0:12:39,9 --> 0:12:41,27
it's that easy.


346
0:12:41,27 --> 0:12:43,1
The best part of learning the
tablecloth trick is you can


347
0:12:43,1 --> 0:12:44,36
come up with your
own variations.


348
0:12:44,36 --> 0:12:45,83
So here, take a look at this.

Here's the plate, glasses.


354
0:12:53,19 --> 0:12:56,48
And now you take another plate
on top of the glass like this.


355
0:12:56,48 --> 0:13:1,11
And now the glass goes on top.

enough-- don't get crazy.
