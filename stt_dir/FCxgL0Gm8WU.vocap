###9 TRAVIS BROWNE: Before, I was little more superstitious
###10 about stuff, and I'd be like, OK, well, everything has to be
###15 like just perfect.
###16 And I still kind of am.
###18 It's like there are sometimes that if something's happening,
###22 I get a little irritated about something.
###24 But for the most part, I learned how to relax and just
###28 go with the flow and know that, at the end of the day,
###30 all the work that I've done was put in my camp.
###33 And the result will be the result no matter what it is.
###36 -This is what we do and why we do it, baby.
###39 No doubt, nobody does it any better.
###41 This is your night, your fight.
###43 You get it right, son.
###44 All that hard work, all that time in the gym, now it's time
###48 to get it done.
###49 
###76 -When you get over there today, please, please make
###79 sure when you go up in front of the commission that you
###82 identify specifically the people that you want on your
###86 corner shoot tomorrow.
###88 Travis Browne.
###89 TRAVIS BROWNE: Yep.
###90 The thing about fighting, for two months, we're doing
###94 everything for ourselves.
###95 Like, nobody else is going to get in that damn cage with us.
###97 You know?
###99 So for two months straight before a fight, we are some of
###102 most selfish people out there.
###104 And we have every right to be.
###106 So after the fights or even leading up to the fights--
###109 it gets even that much more intense
###111 leading up to the fight.
###112 I fought Chad in April, and I went back a week later to
###116 train for 146 just as an alternate.
###119 And then I went back two weeks later to train for my fight
###121 with Ben Rothwell.
###123 That got cut a week before the fight.
###127 And then I went home for two weeks and then came back and
###130 did another seven week camp for this fight.
###131 So it was like rough, bro.
###135 -What have you guys been chatting about so far?
###137 They're from New York.
###138 You've got a fight tomorrow.
###141 TRAVIS BROWNE: Yeah, we've got a fight tomorrow.
###142 You guys came in.
###143 -I saw Big Foot in the hotel.
###144 He looked a little scared actually.
###145 TRAVIS BROWNE: Oh, did you?
###146 -He did, yeah.
###147 -He didn't really look as big as I expected.
###148 You're actually a lot taller.
###150 TRAVIS BROWNE: Oh, yeah.
###150 I'm a lot taller.
###151 But he's a big dude.
###153 Did you shake his hand?
###153 -No.
###154 TRAVIS BROWNE: His hands are like this big.
###157 
###161 With Silva, there's little things that he does that we
###163 just have to be careful about.
###165 In the long run, I'm just training to train.
###169 I'm just training to fight like I'm going to fight.
###172 My style isn't going to change regardless who it is.
###177 I'm one of the taller guys in the division.
###179 I have one of the longer reaches.
###180 So I'm just going to use that in every single fight I can.
###183 -Travis Hapa Browne versus Antonio Big Foot Silva.
###188 246 for Travis Browne.
###200 TRAVIS BROWNE: I think usually the guys that feel like they
###203 have to try and intimidate somebody are usually the ones
###206 that feel like they have something to make up for.
###209 You know?
###210 I go there.
###213 I do my stare down, and I'm good with just walking away.
###218 But if somebody wants to get in there and get in my face
###221 and try to posture on me to make me back down, they're
###225 going to get it right back.
###226 And that's what happened today.
###228 He got where we are like touching noses and all this
###231 kind of stuff.
###232 And Dana had to come in.
###233 And at that point, I'm not going to back down.
###236 If you're going to bring it up like that, you better be able
###239 to back it up the next day.
###240 
###243 -Travis, can I get your autograph?
###244 TRAVIS BROWNE: Yeah.
###244 For sure, bud.
###245 -Thanks, dude.
###247 [CHATTERING]
###253 -Thanks, man.
###254 Can I get a picture with you too, bro?
###255 TRAVIS BROWNE: Yeah.
###256 
###260 -Good luck, dude.
###260 TRAVIS BROWNE: Thanks, man.
###262 
###263 Fans coming up to you wanting to take your picture, or have
###267 an autograph, or just talk for a little bit or something is,
###270 for me, that means I'm doing my job right.
###272 It means that they're interested in me as a fighter,
###274 and they're excited to watch me fight.
###276 That's why they bought the ticket, to go and spend the
###279 night there waiting for me to get into the cage and knock
###283 somebody out.
###285 Today during the stare down, my opponent kind of got a
###290 little close.
###291 And he wanted to keep an eye on me.
###293 So I was just showing him that he's got a fight tomorrow.
###297 You can't look away, you know?
###298 You can't submit like that.
###300 So he knows.
###301 He knows what's coming down tomorrow.
###303 And I look forward to it.
###305 
###319 I try to eat these pretty plain, even
###320 though this is curry.
###322 It's still eight hours before my fight.
###324 So my next meal will be pretty bland.
###330 I just try to eat stuff that gives me energy.
###333 The day of my fight, in the morning I'll be waking up.
###336 And I'll just be warming up with my coach and really just
###340 going over last minute game plan things.
###342 And just break a sweat, hitting pads, doing a little
###345 bit of wrestling, staying focused on our game plan.
###349 That way when I'm in the cage, it's just second nature.
###352 I don't have to think about it.
###353 It just happens.
###354 It helps you get over that first hump in the day where
###358 you might feel a little sluggish, a little slow, or
###361 something like that.
###362 That way when you're warming up right before you walk out
###365 for your fight, you're already on your second wind.
###367 You're like, OK, I'm ready to go.
###369 This is it.
###370 There's nothing holding me back.
###372 And you're walking into that arena knowing that you're
###374 ready to fight.
###376 -Mr. Browne, what's up, baby?
###377 TRAVIS BROWNE: What's up?
###379 -All the way down on the end, baby.
###382 All the way down on the end.
###384 TRAVIS BROWNE: Coach, that spin kick's coming nasty.
###386 -Is it?
###387 TRAVIS BROWNE: Yeah.
###388 
###390 With coach Jackson and coach Wink has really helped me in a
###396 couple different ways.
###399 They have the perfect yin and yang tactics, I
###403 guess you could say.
###405 But really it's the environment that they've
###407 created in the gym also with my training partners and the
###411 environment where the gym is.
###414 Definitely my striking has come around a lot.
###416 I've really learned what my body can do.
###417 And I think coach Wink has had a lot to do with that.
###420 He's like, oh, you like that?
###421 Yeah, let's work it.
###421 Let's make it a weapon and go out and perform and
###426 do what I do best.
###427 And I already have the mentality that I'm going to go
###429 in that cage, and I'm going to go in that cage to hurt you.
###432 I'm not your friend.
###434 I'm not your family.
###436 And even if I was, if you're in that cage with me on flight
###440 day, I'm still going to try to hurt you.
###443 Because you're going to try to do the same thing to me.
###444 
###473 -Travis Hapa Browne.
###479 [FIGHT COMMENTARY]
###505 -Declaring the winner by TKO Antonio Big Foot Silva.
###512 
###540 TRAVIS BROWNE: At this point it just motivates me.
###542 It pisses me off that somebody like that is going to make a
###544 name off me.
###546 He's my first defeat.
###547 And being cordial and all that kind of shit put aside, that
###556 mother fucker doesn't beat me on my worst day.
###558 I got injured in the fight.
###561 And I wouldn't mind that being my first fight back.
###565 I want that fight back, everybody knows it.
###567 
###570 And all it's going to do is motivate the fuck out of me.
###574 If I wasn't motivated before, I am now.
###577 My whole thing is that if he was better than me today, I
###579 wouldn't have a problem with it.
###580 But the fact that I got injured and I was hurt in the
###584 first fucking 30 seconds of the fight, just
###586 fucking pisses me off.
###587 And for him to make a staple in his career off of my name,
###592 makes it even worse.
###594
