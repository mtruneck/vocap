1
0:0:13,848 --> 0:0:15,393
Ever wonder where most of the food


2
0:0:15,393 --> 0:0:17,598
you eat every day comes from?


3
0:0:17,598 --> 0:0:19,563
Well, about 60% of the food you eat


4
0:0:19,563 --> 0:0:21,6
is carbohydrates.


5
0:0:21,6 --> 0:0:23,626
As you can probably tell from its name,


6
0:0:23,626 --> 0:0:25,251
carbohydrates contain carbon,


7
0:0:25,251 --> 0:0:25,749
hydrogen,


8
0:0:25,749 --> 0:0:27,87
and oxygen.


9
0:0:27,87 --> 0:0:29,419
But where do these atoms originally come from


10
0:0:29,419 --> 0:0:30,719
and how do they join together


11
0:0:30,719 --> 0:0:33,963
to make delicious foods like fruits and pasta?


12
0:0:33,963 --> 0:0:35,785
It actually all starts with the air


13
0:0:35,785 --> 0:0:38,17
you are exhaling this very minute,


14
0:0:38,17 --> 0:0:41,149
specifically the carbon dioxide molecules.


15
0:0:41,149 --> 0:0:42,951
Plants are going to breath in


16
0:0:42,951 --> 0:0:44,328
this very same carbon dioxide


17
0:0:44,328 --> 0:0:47,215
through pores in their skin, called stomata.


18
0:0:47,215 --> 0:0:49,296
Plants drink in water from their roots


19
0:0:49,296 --> 0:0:51,862
to get the needed oxygen and hydrogen atoms,


20
0:0:51,862 --> 0:0:53,46
and their electrons,


21
0:0:53,46 --> 0:0:55,222
in order to build carbohydrates.


22
0:0:55,222 --> 0:0:57,66
What is that thing?


23
0:0:57,66 --> 0:0:59,18
Well, that's a special plant organelle


24
0:0:59,18 --> 0:1:0,354
inside the leaves of plants


25
0:1:0,354 --> 0:1:1,897
called a chloroplast.


26
0:1:1,897 --> 0:1:4,313
It's green beceause of a special light-absorbing pigment


27
0:1:4,313 --> 0:1:6,107
called chlorophyll.


28
0:1:6,107 --> 0:1:9,366
Each leaf has about 44,000 cells


29
0:1:9,366 --> 0:1:11,203
and every cell can have anywhere


30
0:1:11,203 --> 0:1:14,197
between 20 to 100 chloroplasts.


31
0:1:14,197 --> 0:1:17,659
That's up to 4,400,000 chloroplasts!


32
0:1:17,659 --> 0:1:18,989
By now, you've probably guessed


33
0:1:18,989 --> 0:1:21,827
that we're talking about the process of photosynthesis


34
0:1:21,827 --> 0:1:22,87
and you might be wondering


35
0:1:22,87 --> 0:1:25,657
when the sun is going to make its entrance.


36
0:1:25,657 --> 0:1:28,411
Let's go back to that original molecule of water.


37
0:1:28,411 --> 0:1:30,685
The plant has to split this molecule of water


38
0:1:30,685 --> 0:1:32,788
so it can get electrons from it.


39
0:1:32,788 --> 0:1:36,92
But, the plant can't pull that water apart by itself.


40
0:1:36,92 --> 0:1:39,161
It needs help from the high-energy rays of the sun.


41
0:1:39,161 --> 0:1:41,723
So now that the chloroplast has all the building blocks


42
0:1:41,723 --> 0:1:44,546
- carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and electrons -


43
0:1:44,546 --> 0:1:45,663
it can use them to go through


44
0:1:45,663 --> 0:1:48,136
the rest of the steps of photosynthesis


45
0:1:48,136 --> 0:1:50,634
to transform that original carbon dioxide gas


46
0:1:50,634 --> 0:1:53,847
into a simple carbohydrate called glucose,


47
0:1:53,847 --> 0:1:56,625
C-6-H-12-O-6.


48
0:1:56,625 --> 0:1:59,27
That little glucose molecule then helps to build


49
0:1:59,27 --> 0:2:0,782
bigger and better carbohydrates


50
0:2:0,782 --> 0:2:2,545
like cellulose.


51
0:2:2,545 --> 0:2:5,284
Cellulose is a type of carbohydrate found in plants


52
0:2:5,284 --> 0:2:7,376
that our body cannot break down.


53
0:2:7,376 --> 0:2:8,506
We call it fiber


54
0:2:8,506 --> 0:2:10,209
and we eat it in vegetables like lettuce,


55
0:2:10,209 --> 0:2:10,8
broccoli,


56
0:2:10,8 --> 0:2:12,127
and celery.


57
0:2:12,127 --> 0:2:14,912
Plants use cellulose to keep themselves strong.


58
0:2:14,912 --> 0:2:17,568
The plant could also turn that glucose into starch,


59
0:2:17,568 --> 0:2:20,301
a large molecule that stores energy for the plant.


60
0:2:20,301 --> 0:2:22,217
We love eating starch from plants like potatoes,


61
0:2:22,217 --> 0:2:22,835
corn,


62
0:2:22,835 --> 0:2:24,161
and rice.


63
0:2:24,161 --> 0:2:26,239
So you see, when you eat plants,


64
0:2:26,239 --> 0:2:28,675
we're actually benefiting from photosynthesis.


65
0:2:28,675 --> 0:2:30,802
The plant makes things like starch,


66
0:2:30,802 --> 0:2:31,489
which we eat


67
0:2:31,489 --> 0:2:34,136
and then break back down into glucose,


68
0:2:34,136 --> 0:2:36,192
the first form the plant made.


69
0:2:36,192 --> 0:2:38,492
Then, the mitochondria in our cells,


70
0:2:38,492 --> 0:2:40,234
powered by the oxygen we breath,


71
0:2:40,234 --> 0:2:43,137
can turn glucose into pure energy molecules


72
0:2:43,137 --> 0:2:45,222
called ATP.


73
0:2:45,222 --> 0:2:47,335
ATP powers all work done


74
0:2:47,335 --> 0:2:49,382
by each and every one of your cells,


75
0:2:49,382 --> 0:2:50,486
things like communication,


76
0:2:50,486 --> 0:2:51,7
movement,


77
0:2:51,7 --> 0:2:52,529
and transport.


78
0:2:52,529 --> 0:2:56,236
But why do we have to turn that glucose into ATP?


79
0:2:56,236 --> 0:2:57,991
Well, think of it like this.


80
0:2:57,991 --> 0:2:59,941
You're excited to start your summer job


81
0:2:59,941 --> 0:3:1,73
at the local ice cream stand,


82
0:3:1,73 --> 0:3:3,44
but your boss has just told you


83
0:3:3,44 --> 0:3:7,307
that she is going to pay you in ice cream cones.


84
0:3:7,307 --> 0:3:8,741
What are you going to be able to do


85
0:3:8,741 --> 0:3:10,573
with those ice cream cones?


86
0:3:10,573 --> 0:3:11,81
Nothing,


87
0:3:11,81 --> 0:3:15,322
which is why you kindly asked to be paid in dollars.


88
0:3:15,322 --> 0:3:17,467
ATP is just like dollars.


89
0:3:17,467 --> 0:3:20,385
It is the currency that all cells of life use


90
0:3:20,385 --> 0:3:21,626
while glucose is,


91
0:3:21,626 --> 0:3:23,642
well, kind of like ice cream.


92
0:3:23,642 --> 0:3:26,671
Even plants have mitochondria in their cells


93
0:3:26,671 --> 0:3:30,248
to break down the glucose they make into ATP.


94
0:3:30,248 --> 0:3:31,821
So as you can see,


95
0:3:31,821 --> 0:3:34,199
humans and plants are intricately connected.


96
0:3:34,199 --> 0:3:35,36
The air we breath out


97
0:3:35,36 --> 0:3:37,451
is used by plants to make the carbohydrates


98
0:3:37,451 --> 0:3:39,156
we enjoy so much.


99
0:3:39,156 --> 0:3:40,626
And, in the process,


100
0:3:40,626 --> 0:3:43,303
they are releasing the very same oxygen molecules


101
0:3:43,303 --> 0:3:44,478
we need to breath in


102
0:3:44,478 --> 0:3:46,601
in order that our mitochondria can break down


103
0:3:46,601 --> 0:5:46,601
our delicous carbohydrate meal.
