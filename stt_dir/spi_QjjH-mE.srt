CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: Hi, I`m Carl Azuz.
And this is CNN STUDENT NEWS. Ten minutes,


2
0:0:4,69 --> 0:0:8,42
no commercials, headlines from around the
world coming straight to your classroom. It


3
0:0:8,42 --> 0:0:16,59
all starts right now.


4
0:0:16,59 --> 0:0:27,689
Two weeks after the so called Super Storm
Sandy hit the North Eastern U.S., there are


5
0:0:27,689 --> 0:0:32,119
some signs of recovery in the region. Power
has been restored for millions of people,


6
0:0:32,119 --> 0:0:37,59
some bridges and tunnels have reopened. But
signs of devastation and struggle are there


7
0:0:37,59 --> 0:0:42,51
too. Officials say the storm is responsible
for at least 113 death in the U.S., more than


8
0:0:42,51 --> 0:0:47,999
160,000 people still don`t have power. That
means they are fighting the cold as the temperature


9
0:0:47,999 --> 0:0:53,42
drops. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano
says the priority is to get food, shelter


10
0:0:53,42 --> 0:0:57,539
and clothing to these victims of the storm.
Some of that is coming from relief groups


11
0:0:57,539 --> 0:1:2,519
and volunteers like this team from New Orleans
that cooked and served thousands of meals.


12
0:1:2,519 --> 0:1:7,53

0:1:12,68 --> 0:1:18,0
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Is this legit? Saudi
Arabia is the world`s largest producer of


16
0:1:18,0 --> 0:1:19,31
oil?


17
0:1:19,31 --> 0:1:25,979
It`s true. The Middle Eastern nation is home
to around one fifth of the entire world`s


18
0:1:25,979 --> 0:1:28,2
existing reserves of oil.


19
0:1:28,2 --> 0:1:30,71
(END VIDEO CLIP)


20
0:1:30,71 --> 0:1:36,9
AZUZ: But Saudi Arabia might lose that number
one ranking by the end of this decade. A new


21
0:1:36,9 --> 0:1:41,549
report says the U.S. will be the world`s top
producer of oil by the year 2020. The U.S.


22
0:1:41,549 --> 0:1:46,79
is going through a sort of oil boom right
now, and part of that is thanks to new technology.


23
0:1:46,79 --> 0:1:50,53
For example, hydraulic fracturing, which is
sometimes called fracking. It`s a process


24
0:1:50,53 --> 0:1:54,96
that involves pumping water and chemicals
into the ground to cause rock formations to


25
0:1:54,96 --> 0:2:0,49
fracture and release oil and natural gas.
It`s controversial, though. Some researchers


26
0:2:0,49 --> 0:2:4,82
are worried that the process could hurt the
environment. That same concern, producing


27
0:2:4,82 --> 0:2:9,119
oil versus protecting the environment is happening
up in the Arctic, where some companies are


28
0:2:9,119 --> 0:2:11,84
planning to drill. Miguel Marquez has more
on that.


29
0:2:11,84 --> 0:2:12,1
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


30
0:2:12,1 --> 0:2:16,64
MIGUEL MARQUEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: This is
the spot where America`s oil needs meets environmental


31
0:2:16,64 --> 0:2:18,51
frustration and concern.


32
0:2:18,51 --> 0:2:23,36
The Noble Discoverer, one of two rigs Shell
is operating in the Arctic, the rigs aren`t


33
0:2:23,36 --> 0:2:28,39
drilling for oil, only putting in 1500 foot
preparatory wells that they`ll revisit and


34
0:2:28,39 --> 0:2:31,82
complete next year when the real work begins.


35
0:2:31,82 --> 0:2:35,92
Success here doesn`t come easy. In a setback,
Shell scaled back its drilling plants this


36
0:2:35,92 --> 0:2:41,0
summer after a major piece of cleanup gear
and oil containment dome was damaged during


37
0:2:41,0 --> 0:2:46,19
testing. To win drilling right, Shell has
paid for and equipped its own armada of cleanup


38
0:2:46,19 --> 0:2:51,45
vessels. Environmentalists and some Alaskan
native say, the failure is proof the Arctic


39
0:2:51,45 --> 0:2:53,7
is not ready for oil exploration.


40
0:2:53,7 --> 0:2:57,78
(on camera): You can`t have success in a controlled
environment, how can you be confident you


41
0:2:57,78 --> 0:2:59,22
can control it in the place like the Arctic?


42
0:2:59,22 --> 0:3:1,36
PETE SLALBY, VICE PRESIDENT, SHELL ALASKA:
Well, first of all, we are working on this,


43
0:3:1,36 --> 0:3:6,6
this is why we were testing the containment
dome to begin with. We were looking at a really,


44
0:3:6,6 --> 0:3:12,81
say, it is a serial number one piece of equipment.
So the work we are doing is really working


45
0:3:12,81 --> 0:3:16,45
to work all the bugs out of the problems before
we bring it up to the Arctic.


46
0:3:16,45 --> 0:3:20,5
MARQUEZ (voice over): But oil from the Arctic
won`t come cheap and it won`t come easily.


47
0:3:20,5 --> 0:3:25,39
Shell has already spent $5 billion just to
get to this point, and they are not entirely


48
0:3:25,39 --> 0:3:31,4
sure what they`ll find down there. They believe
that as much as 20 percent of America`s future


49
0:3:31,4 --> 0:3:35,2
oil needs could be below the sea floor where
I`m standing.

(END VIDEOTAPE)


51
0:3:35,88 --> 0:3:41,95
AZUZ: The U.S. Navy is hoping to send a message.
It punished seven of its elite Special Forces


52
0:3:41,95 --> 0:3:46,93
members, its Navy SEALs for releasing classified
information. Now, normally, this kind of punishment


53
0:3:46,93 --> 0:3:51,54
would be handled privately. But not this time
around. The U.S. Navy made this punishment


54
0:3:51,54 --> 0:3:57,34
public, because commanders wanted to let all
SEALs know that this kind of behavior is unacceptable.


55
0:3:57,34 --> 0:3:59,14
Brian Todd now tells us what this is all about.


56
0:3:59,14 --> 0:3:59,76
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


57
0:3:59,76 --> 0:4:3,95
BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: You are in
their eyes, as they sprint through dangerous


58
0:4:3,95 --> 0:4:7,51
terrain, dodge explosions, gun down their
enemies.


59
0:4:7,51 --> 0:4:13,1
The new video game "Medal of Honor: Warfighter"
from Electronic Arts brags that it gives you


60
0:4:13,1 --> 0:4:17,799
the experience of fighting with SEAL Team
Six. It`s given seven real members of that


61
0:4:17,799 --> 0:4:23,0
team the experience of losing half their pay
for two months and likely their careers. At


62
0:4:23,0 --> 0:4:27,9
least one of those SEALs was on the raid that
killed Osama bin Laden last year. A Navy official


63
0:4:27,9 --> 0:4:32,849
says the seven, all active duty, have been
reprimanded for giving up classified information


64
0:4:32,849 --> 0:4:35,71
to the makers of the game when they worked
as paid consultants.


65
0:4:35,71 --> 0:4:37,33
(on camera): Why do you think they gave up?


66
0:4:37,33 --> 0:4:41,11
JOHN MCGUIRE, FORMER NAVY SEAL: I wasn`t part
of the game, but making the game, but I heard


67
0:4:41,11 --> 0:4:44,58
that they might have shown their equipment
that they used, and for some people that might


68
0:4:44,58 --> 0:4:48,3
not seem like a big deal, but you put a little
piece of information here, together with another


69
0:4:48,3 --> 0:4:52,229
piece of information there and you can get
some information to put people in harms` way.


70
0:4:52,229 --> 0:4:56,86
TODD: John McGuire is a former Navy SEAL who
served ten years. He says one big problem


71
0:4:56,86 --> 0:5:0,969
with what these SEALs did was that it was
not authorized by their commanders, but the


72
0:5:0,969 --> 0:5:2,96
problems go beyond that.


73
0:5:2,96 --> 0:5:7,93
This episode adds more controversy over SEALs
capitalizing on their reputation. John McGuire`s


74
0:5:7,93 --> 0:5:12,2
got an outdoor fitness business based on his
experience. He had to clear the name of that


75
0:5:12,2 --> 0:5:16,979
business 14 years ago with the Navy. There
was a recent movie, "Act of Valor" featuring


76
0:5:16,979 --> 0:5:21,949
real active duty Navy SEALs, that was cleared
by the Pentagon. But there was also a book


77
0:5:21,949 --> 0:5:26,289
written by a former SEAL who was on the bin
Laden raid. The Pentagon complained about


78
0:5:26,289 --> 0:5:27,999
that for revealing secret information.


79
0:5:27,999 --> 0:5:31,31
HARRY HUMPHRIES, FORMER NAVY SEAL: It`s gotten
out of hand. There is entirely too much being


80
0:5:31,31 --> 0:5:39,96
discussed about a community that lives on
the fact that it`s a group of folks that thrive


81
0:5:39,96 --> 0:5:42,919
on a concept called silent pride.


82
0:5:42,919 --> 0:5:48,439
TODD: The SEALs lives are secret, their identities
classified. Still, one former SEAL disputes


83
0:5:48,439 --> 0:5:53,159
the notion that the video game gave much away.
He says raids of militants compounds have


84
0:5:53,159 --> 0:5:55,81
not suggested they use video games for intel.

Kennedy Middle School in Plainfield, Illinois.

The festival of Diwali is observed by which
of these religions? Here we go, is it Taoism,

0:6:12,62 --> 0:6:21,849
Hinduism, Shintoism or Baha`I? You`ve got
three seconds, go!


91
0:6:21,849 --> 0:6:29,629
Diwali is a festival of lights in Hinduism,
the world`s third largest religion. That`s


92
0:6:29,629 --> 0:6:33,729

AZUZ: Diwali is one of the most important
festivals in Hinduism, it`s happening right


95
0:6:41,139 --> 0:6:46,599
now, starts today and lasts for five days.
The word Diwali means "row of lights," and


96
0:6:46,599 --> 0:6:50,74
that`s what you`ll see a lot of during this
celebration. Everything from small lamps to


97
0:6:50,74 --> 0:6:56,49
lights to giant fireworks displays. For Hindus,
the Diwali festival represents the victory


98
0:6:56,49 --> 0:7:1,36
of light over darkness, good over evil. It
also marks the start of a New Year, and it`s


99
0:7:1,36 --> 0:7:6,46
a time when many Hindus exchange gifts and
offer prayers for a successful year. ` All


100
0:7:6,46 --> 0:7:10,46
right. Our next report today is from Sara
Hoye. It`s about a program for teenagers in


101
0:7:10,46 --> 0:7:15,3
Philadelphia that`s called "Cradle to Grave."
It takes place at a hospital, and the people


102
0:7:15,3 --> 0:7:19,87
who designed the program hope that by bringing
these teens there as visitors, they can teach


103
0:7:19,87 --> 0:7:24,21
them about the dangers of gun violence and
prevent them from returning to the hospital


104
0:7:24,21 --> 0:7:24,539
as patients.

0:7:25,69 --> 0:7:28,529
SCOTT CHARLES, CRADLE TO GRAVE Welcome. I
work with gunshot patients. How many of you


107
0:7:28,529 --> 0:7:29,879
guys know somebody who`s been shot?


108
0:7:29,879 --> 0:7:33,24
SARA HOYE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Philadelphia
educator Scott Charles is on a mission to


109
0:7:33,24 --> 0:7:38,99
save young lives. Charles and Amy Goldberg,
chief trauma surgeon at Temple University


110
0:7:38,99 --> 0:7:42,419
Hospital, co-founded the Cradle to Grave program
to help reduce gun violence in the city of


111
0:7:42,419 --> 0:7:43,129
brotherly love.


112
0:7:43,129 --> 0:7:46,389
CHARLES: What we are going to do today is
kind of take you behind the scenes, pull back


113
0:7:46,389 --> 0:7:47,93
the curtain and let you see what we do ...


114
0:7:47,93 --> 0:7:51,9
HOYE: The Cradle to Grave program brings local
high school students inside Temple`s trauma


115
0:7:51,9 --> 0:7:56,43
center to relive the final 15 minutes of life
of a teen killed by gun violence.


116
0:7:56,43 --> 0:8:2,589
CHARLES: That young boy stood over Lamont
(ph) and fired ten more shots into him.


117
0:8:2,589 --> 0:8:9,159
AMY GOLDBERG, CRADLE TO GRAVE: You know gun
violence can kill. But I think it`s really


118
0:8:9,159 --> 0:8:12,969
our responsibility to prevent these kids from
coming in.


119
0:8:12,969 --> 0:8:18,229
HOYE: Among America`s largest cities, Philadelphia`s
homicide rate is the worst. With African Americans


120
0:8:18,229 --> 0:8:20,249
making up 85 percent of the victims.


121
0:8:20,249 --> 0:8:24,93
CHARLES: You know, statistics suggest that
as a young black man, you have a greater chance


122
0:8:24,93 --> 0:8:29,27
of being shot and killed in Philadelphia than
you would have if you were a soldier serving


123
0:8:29,27 --> 0:8:34,38
in the conflicts in Afghanistan or Iraq. That`s
absurd to me.


124
0:8:34,38 --> 0:8:38,82
HOYE: Since 2006, more than 7,000 students
have come to the Cradle to Grave program.


125
0:8:38,82 --> 0:8:42,75
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Like I don`t want that
to happen to me. Like I want to be able to


126
0:8:42,75 --> 0:8:45,3
live, be someone my mom wants me to be.


127
0:8:45,3 --> 0:8:50,23
GOLDBERG: We want to really teach them the
preciousness of life. That in an instant your


128
0:8:50,23 --> 0:8:52,33
life can be changed forever.


129
0:8:52,33 --> 0:8:55,46

for. You can comment on our blog and if you
are at least 13 years old, you can tell us


134
0:9:7,63 --> 0:9:12,46
in person through an I-report. Now, on the
I-reports, no music, just you and the camera,

this is your chance to get on CNN STUDENT
NEWS. Visit us at cnnstudentnews.com.


136
0:9:16,92 --> 0:9:22,47
Today`s before we go segment is either incredibly
cute or incredibly creepy. Actually, it might


137
0:9:22,47 --> 0:9:28,87
be a little bit of both. This is a slow loris,
and this is how a slow loris eats a rice ball.


138
0:9:28,87 --> 0:9:34,18
It takes the rice ball slowly. It considers
the rice ball slowly. It nibbles the rice


139
0:9:34,18 --> 0:9:39,7
ball slowly. Well, at least it lives up to
its name. For the record, it`s holding a fork,


140
0:9:39,7 --> 0:9:44,1
but eating with its hand. So, no table manners.
You might think loris is a made up name, but


141
0:9:44,1 --> 0:9:48,27
that`s why we show you videos like this, so
you know what the truth is and what the lore


142
0:9:48,27 --> 0:9:48,52
is.


143
0:9:48,52 --> 0:11:48,52
That`s going to wrap things up for us today.
For CNN STUDENT NEWS, I`m Carl Azuz.
