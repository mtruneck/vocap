0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:13,38



2
0:0:13,38 --> 0:0:15,6
ROCCO CASTORO: Hi, I'm Rocco,
and today we're in Venice


3
0:0:15,6 --> 0:0:19,8
Beach at the Rose Cafe,
which is a favorite


4
0:0:19,8 --> 0:0:21,3
eatery of Rob Delaney.


5
0:0:21,3 --> 0:0:24,34
He's a very funny comedian and
what some have termed the King


6
0:0:24,34 --> 0:0:25,24
of Twitter.


7
0:0:25,24 --> 0:0:28,62
He writes a column for us
at Vice on the website.


8
0:0:28,62 --> 0:0:31,25
And today we're going to have
breakfast with him and chat


9
0:0:31,25 --> 0:0:35,88
about eating vaginas, Rick
Santorum, hairiness, and all


10
0:0:35,88 --> 0:0:37,15
sorts of other fun stuff.


11
0:0:37,15 --> 0:0:42,67



12
0:0:42,67 --> 0:0:45,11
ROCCO CASTORO: I'm hear on a
lovely Wednesday morning with


13
0:0:45,11 --> 0:0:47,6
the lovely Rob Delaney.


14
0:0:47,6 --> 0:0:47,9
ROB DELANEY: Hello.


15
0:0:47,9 --> 0:0:50,11
ROCCO CASTORO: The first thing
you did for us and how this


16
0:0:50,11 --> 0:0:54,63
relationship started was a piece
in our Larfs issue a


17
0:0:54,63 --> 0:0:56,19
couple years back.


18
0:0:56,19 --> 0:0:58,3
And the piece was
called "Comedy."


19
0:0:58,3 --> 0:0:58,55
ROB DELANEY: It was.


20
0:0:58,55 --> 0:1:0,19
ROCCO CASTORO: It actually
opened the issue.


21
0:1:0,19 --> 0:1:4,23
ROB DELANEY: Yeah, well, I had
been approached by your


22
0:1:4,23 --> 0:1:7,56
magazine to write for them
anything I wanted,


23
0:1:7,56 --> 0:1:9,22
essentially, about comedy.


24
0:1:9,22 --> 0:1:15,69
And I remember lamenting that
most magazines, when they do a


25
0:1:15,69 --> 0:1:20,59
comedy issue, it's usually
really awful and unfunny.


26
0:1:20,59 --> 0:1:25,34
So I really just tried to sort
of plumb my depths, so to


27
0:1:25,34 --> 0:1:28,35
speak, psychologically and just
talk about my motivations


28
0:1:28,35 --> 0:1:30,87
for doing comedy, what I think
is funny, what's not funny,


29
0:1:30,87 --> 0:1:33,88
why it might be funny, what
sort of drives me.


30
0:1:33,88 --> 0:1:35,26
Because I like comedians.


31
0:1:35,26 --> 0:1:36,1
I like it other comedians.


32
0:1:36,1 --> 0:1:37,92
And I like fans of comedy.


33
0:1:37,92 --> 0:1:41,1
And I wanted to give them
something like this that would


34
0:1:41,1 --> 0:1:42,83
hopefully nourish them.


35
0:1:42,83 --> 0:1:46,506
I wanted them to have
the sandwich.


36
0:1:46,506 --> 0:1:49,14
ROCCO CASTORO: The subject
matter of that article--


37
0:1:49,14 --> 0:1:52,89
sort of lay of the land at that
point in your life, what


38
0:1:52,89 --> 0:1:53,77
you're doing.


39
0:1:53,77 --> 0:1:56,7
And you told me earlier
that you were--


40
0:1:56,7 --> 0:1:57,93
I don't know if you were at
the time, but right around


41
0:1:57,93 --> 0:2:0,67
then working at a call center
but also doing comedy, and


42
0:2:0,67 --> 0:2:3,83
this was a year and
a half ago.


43
0:2:3,83 --> 0:2:5,99
But you also talked a little bit
about what happened to you


44
0:2:5,99 --> 0:2:10,5
10 years ago, which you can say
much better than I can.


45
0:2:10,5 --> 0:2:11,63
ROB DELANEY: Yeah, well.


46
0:2:11,63 --> 0:2:13,655
Yeah, first, I'll say
you're right.


47
0:2:13,655 --> 0:2:18,83
I'm very lucky right now to be
making a living doing comedy,


48
0:2:18,83 --> 0:2:22,66
but it was just 10 years ago
that I was in a big car


49
0:2:22,66 --> 0:2:25,9
accident that prompted
me to quit drinking.


50
0:2:25,9 --> 0:2:30,29
But yeah, I drove into a
building in LA and broke both


51
0:2:30,29 --> 0:2:33,39
my arms and was in jail
in a wheelchair.


52
0:2:33,39 --> 0:2:37,41
And it was then that I was like,
oh, if I keep drinking,


53
0:2:37,41 --> 0:2:39,13
it'll kill other people.


54
0:2:39,13 --> 0:2:41,252
And I didn't want to
kill other people.


55
0:2:41,252 --> 0:2:43,6
I don't like to kill people.


56
0:2:43,6 --> 0:2:44,82
Sorry, guys.


57
0:2:44,82 --> 0:2:49,38
So after I kind of physically
got better from that accident,


58
0:2:49,38 --> 0:2:52,21
I said, oh, I'm a
comedian now.


59
0:2:52,21 --> 0:2:54,38
ROCCO CASTORO: So do you
remember the first time that


60
0:2:54,38 --> 0:2:57,35
you found out what
Twitter was?


61
0:2:57,35 --> 0:3:0,21
ROB DELANEY: Well, the first
time I heard what it was, I


62
0:3:0,21 --> 0:3:4,53
think I was at a comedy show
and somebody mentioned it.


63
0:3:4,53 --> 0:3:7,7
I'd heard about it maybe on
the news or something.


64
0:3:7,7 --> 0:3:9,48
And it sounded very
unappealing.


65
0:3:9,48 --> 0:3:9,91
Why?


66
0:3:9,91 --> 0:3:11,3
Who cares?


67
0:3:11,3 --> 0:3:13,95
I was on Facebook and Louis
CK had said that


68
0:3:13,95 --> 0:3:16,12
he had joined Twitter.


69
0:3:16,12 --> 0:3:18,53
And I thought, well, maybe--


70
0:3:18,53 --> 0:3:21,12
he usually does things that
I think are funny and


71
0:3:21,12 --> 0:3:21,73
intelligent.


72
0:3:21,73 --> 0:3:22,47
I should check it out.


73
0:3:22,47 --> 0:3:23,49
So I did.


74
0:3:23,49 --> 0:3:29,97
And what I tried to do was just
post jokes rather than,


75
0:3:29,97 --> 0:3:31,38
like, I ate this.


76
0:3:31,38 --> 0:3:34,2
ROCCO CASTORO: So where
did your Twitter--


77
0:3:34,2 --> 0:3:34,67
picture?


78
0:3:34,67 --> 0:3:35,89
I don't know if it's
an avatar?


79
0:3:35,89 --> 0:3:37,49
You're in Speedos.


80
0:3:37,49 --> 0:3:37,6
ROB DELANEY: Yeah.


81
0:3:37,6 --> 0:3:39,28
I am wearing a Speedo
bathing suit.


82
0:3:39,28 --> 0:3:43,18
And that is a bathing suit
that I do genuinely own,


83
0:3:43,18 --> 0:3:45,23
because I live very close
to the beach.


84
0:3:45,23 --> 0:3:48,3
So if I go swimming in the
winter, I will wear that


85
0:3:48,3 --> 0:3:50,95
'cause it just makes more
sense under a wetsuit.


86
0:3:50,95 --> 0:3:54,79
So I totally am aware of the
fact that it's a disgusting


87
0:3:54,79 --> 0:3:57,73
look on a hairy large person.


88
0:3:57,73 --> 0:4:0,75
But basically, I was getting
ready to go swimming at night


89
0:4:0,75 --> 0:4:3,9
with my wife, and my friend John
was there, and I took off


90
0:4:3,9 --> 0:4:7,1
my clothes and had the Speedo,
and he's like, Jesus.


91
0:4:7,1 --> 0:4:8,3
He took a picture.


92
0:4:8,3 --> 0:4:10,41
And then when I first signed up
for Twitter, I thought, oh,


93
0:4:10,41 --> 0:4:12,88
this is so stupid, I'll put
the worst picture of


94
0:4:12,88 --> 0:4:13,8
me that I have up.


95
0:4:13,8 --> 0:4:15,14
And that's it.


96
0:4:15,14 --> 0:4:17,82
And then after a while,
people were like, you


97
0:4:17,82 --> 0:4:18,64
gotta rid of that.


98
0:4:18,64 --> 0:4:21,6
And I was like, no,
I'll never.


99
0:4:21,6 --> 0:4:23,29
ROCCO CASTORO: And your last--


100
0:4:23,29 --> 0:4:24,91
well, we'll say your
last two tweets.


101
0:4:24,91 --> 0:4:27,94
Pepsi's Twitter account said,
The best place to


102
0:4:27,94 --> 0:4:30,375
hide a Pepsi is blank.


103
0:4:30,375 --> 0:4:34,6
And Rob responded, in
a cop's asshole.


104
0:4:34,6 --> 0:4:35,35
Nothing aga-- cops--


105
0:4:35,35 --> 0:4:35,94
we need 'em.


106
0:4:35,94 --> 0:4:36,48
I like 'em.


107
0:4:36,48 --> 0:4:39,71
But the word "cop," it's
(ENUNCIATING) cop.


108
0:4:39,71 --> 0:4:41,79
So I've always taught cop
was a funny word.


109
0:4:41,79 --> 0:4:44,8
I have words that I just
think are funny, just


110
0:4:44,8 --> 0:4:45,41
the sound of them.


111
0:4:45,41 --> 0:4:46,4
ROCCO CASTORO: Phonetically?


112
0:4:46,4 --> 0:4:47,72
ROB DELANEY: Yeah, like cop--


113
0:4:47,72 --> 0:4:48,34
ROCCO CASTORO: Cock?


114
0:4:48,34 --> 0:4:49,31
ROB DELANEY: Ham.


115
0:4:49,31 --> 0:4:50,47
Cock is a funny word.


116
0:4:50,47 --> 0:4:51,91
I love the word ham.


117
0:4:51,91 --> 0:4:52,74
Beef.


118
0:4:52,74 --> 0:4:54,43
A lot of meat-related words.


119
0:4:54,43 --> 0:4:57,11
So cop, cop's just
such a nice word.


120
0:4:57,11 --> 0:4:59,2
And anyway, so, and then
asshole, that just always


121
0:4:59,2 --> 0:5:0,22
makes me laugh.


122
0:5:0,22 --> 0:5:1,3
ROCCO CASTORO: OK.


123
0:5:1,3 --> 0:5:6,365
And your tweet before is,
Virginia is for lovers, and


124
0:5:6,365 --> 0:5:8,87
then in parentheses,
of psychotic--


125
0:5:8,87 --> 0:5:9,79
in all caps--


126
0:5:9,79 --> 0:5:11,17
abortion bills.


127
0:5:11,17 --> 0:5:13,34
So why did you tweet that?


128
0:5:13,34 --> 0:5:15,25
ROB DELANEY: There are right now
in Virginia some lawmakers


129
0:5:15,25 --> 0:5:18,72
who have drafted a bill that
would require women who wanted


130
0:5:18,72 --> 0:5:21,26
to get an abortion to
get an ultrasound.


131
0:5:21,26 --> 0:5:28,45
Now what is a big part of this
is that when a woman is in the


132
0:5:28,45 --> 0:5:31,14
early stages of pregnancy,
the fetus is super tiny.


133
0:5:31,14 --> 0:5:33,76
So they can't use an
over-the-belly ultrasound.


134
0:5:33,76 --> 0:5:38,66
They actually have to put a
probe up her vagina to do the


135
0:5:38,66 --> 0:5:39,39
ultrasound.


136
0:5:39,39 --> 0:5:42,34
And it's a big fucking wand.


137
0:5:42,34 --> 0:5:45,54
It's like bigger than, like,
three of my dicks.


138
0:5:45,54 --> 0:5:47,21
And they're putting it up.


139
0:5:47,21 --> 0:5:47,97
And that--


140
0:5:47,97 --> 0:5:50,53
so it's like robot rape.


141
0:5:50,53 --> 0:5:52,7
It's beyond--


142
0:5:52,7 --> 0:5:54,2
I mean, that's psychological
torture.


143
0:5:54,2 --> 0:5:55,79
It's physical torture.


144
0:5:55,79 --> 0:6:0,88
It's unbelievable and
fundamentally wrong.


145
0:6:0,88 --> 0:6:2,79
ROCCO CASTORO: One thing you
really like to talk about is


146
0:6:2,79 --> 0:6:5,85
women, in a way that
I think is positive


147
0:6:5,85 --> 0:6:8,37
but also very honest.


148
0:6:8,37 --> 0:6:13,53
ROB DELANEY: I do like to take
a more, I don't know,


149
0:6:13,53 --> 0:6:17,76
proletariat approach to like
sexuality, of like a


150
0:6:17,76 --> 0:6:26,5
blue-collar, sweaty, fun
approach to sex.


151
0:6:26,5 --> 0:6:30,16
And I genuinely really
feel the things that


152
0:6:30,16 --> 0:6:33,84
I tweet about that.


153
0:6:33,84 --> 0:6:35,87
Like, I don't like it
when women shave


154
0:6:35,87 --> 0:6:38,3
off their pubic hair.


155
0:6:38,3 --> 0:6:39,75
That is a legitimate
thing that I feel.


156
0:6:39,75 --> 0:6:42,26
That's weird to me.


157
0:6:42,26 --> 0:6:44,47
And maybe it's because I'm a man
and it's easier for me to


158
0:6:44,47 --> 0:6:48,21
see, like it's easier for me to
be an other and see, like,


159
0:6:48,21 --> 0:6:50,16
oh, I see this thing that's
happening to this group of


160
0:6:50,16 --> 0:6:52,63
people, which represents more
than half of our planet's


161
0:6:52,63 --> 0:6:56,0
population, and it's so fucking
wrong that I'm going


162
0:6:56,0 --> 0:6:59,24
to do my little bit that I
possibly can to try and help.


163
0:6:59,24 --> 0:7:2,4
So women usually, the
overwhelming majority, are


164
0:7:2,4 --> 0:7:3,42
funny and nice.


165
0:7:3,42 --> 0:7:5,28
And they'll probably write a
zinger back to me that's


166
0:7:5,28 --> 0:7:7,56
funnier than what I wrote.


167
0:7:7,56 --> 0:7:11,4
ROCCO CASTORO: You've had quite
a few tweets and columns


168
0:7:11,4 --> 0:7:14,21
about the current Republican
candidates.


169
0:7:14,21 --> 0:7:16,99
Who would you say is the
best to make fun of?


170
0:7:16,99 --> 0:7:23,21
ROB DELANEY: Probably Rick
Santorum, because he's the


171
0:7:23,21 --> 0:7:27,15
antipodes of how I feel
about many things.


172
0:7:27,15 --> 0:7:32,56
I feel like his policies, if
enacted, would hurt people.


173
0:7:32,56 --> 0:7:35,4
I feel that he would have a
really negative effect.


174
0:7:35,4 --> 0:7:37,49
So if there's something I see
that I think is having a


175
0:7:37,49 --> 0:7:42,58
negative effect, I'm going to
use comedy to present my ideas


176
0:7:42,58 --> 0:7:46,41
and to eviscerate the ones
that I don't like.


177
0:7:46,41 --> 0:7:47,65
ROCCO CASTORO: When
was there a--


178
0:7:47,65 --> 0:7:50,15
we'll call it an exponential


179
0:7:50,15 --> 0:7:51,84
explosion of Twitter followers?


180
0:7:51,84 --> 0:7:55,39
When did you hit a marker where
you're like, wow, I have


181
0:7:55,39 --> 0:7:57,82
50,000 people following
me on Twitter.


182
0:7:57,82 --> 0:8:0,16
ROB DELANEY: Getting to 100,000
followers took what


183
0:8:0,16 --> 0:8:0,88
felt like forever.


184
0:8:0,88 --> 0:8:3,49
Going from 100,000 to 200,000
was like [SNAP].


185
0:8:3,49 --> 0:8:6,2
Going from 200,000 to 300,000
was like, oh, it happened.


186
0:8:6,2 --> 0:8:7,34
It's crazy.


187
0:8:7,34 --> 0:8:10,93
So the speed that you accumulate
them gets faster.


188
0:8:10,93 --> 0:8:16,35
But the big thing for me was
after years of submitting


189
0:8:16,35 --> 0:8:19,5
packets to late night comedy
shows, and being told, like,


190
0:8:19,5 --> 0:8:23,13
oh, this is terrific, but not
getting hired, I at the same


191
0:8:23,13 --> 0:8:28,71
time got hired by Graham Linehan
to work on story ideas


192
0:8:28,71 --> 0:8:33,799
for the fifth season of the
British show The IT Crowd.


193
0:8:33,799 --> 0:8:38,5
And also I got hired by MTV to
write for a Rob Dyrdek show


194
0:8:38,5 --> 0:8:40,419
called Ridiculousness.


195
0:8:40,419 --> 0:8:43,0
So those two things happened
at the same time.


196
0:8:43,0 --> 0:8:45,51
And Vice Magazine said,
hey, want to


197
0:8:45,51 --> 0:8:46,64
write this comedy article?


198
0:8:46,64 --> 0:8:48,85
ROCCO CASTORO: Some of the most
popular pieces you've


199
0:8:48,85 --> 0:8:52,31
written for us, and I would
imagine tweets as well, have


200
0:8:52,31 --> 0:8:55,42
concerned the nature
of celebrity.


201
0:8:55,42 --> 0:8:58,365
Specifically, a piece you
wrote about suing Kim


202
0:8:58,365 --> 0:9:1,23
Kardashian after her divorce.


203
0:9:1,23 --> 0:9:2,58
ROB DELANEY: Yes.


204
0:9:2,58 --> 0:9:5,285
ROCCO CASTORO: How would
serious were you?


205
0:9:5,285 --> 0:9:11,2
ROB DELANEY: Uh, 100% about
the feelings behind it.


206
0:9:11,2 --> 0:9:12,58
I think that what she
did was wrong.


207
0:9:12,58 --> 0:9:14,12
We know it was fake
from the outset.


208
0:9:14,12 --> 0:9:18,63
So I just wanted to say, no,
young lady, and Ryan Seacrest,


209
0:9:18,63 --> 0:9:21,2
and E Entertainment Television,
and Comcast, who


210
0:9:21,2 --> 0:9:23,52
were also named in
the lawsuit.


211
0:9:23,52 --> 0:9:25,31
ROCCO CASTORO: You're
also writing a book.


212
0:9:25,31 --> 0:9:26,39
ROB DELANEY: I'm
writing a book.


213
0:9:26,39 --> 0:9:27,16
Yes.


214
0:9:27,16 --> 0:9:30,8
The book has nothing
to do Twitter.


215
0:9:30,8 --> 0:9:33,64
It's a memoir/novel
type thing.


216
0:9:33,64 --> 0:9:37,0
Since I am a relatively young
person, I understand that


217
0:9:37,0 --> 0:9:40,2
people wouldn't want to read
a book about just my life.


218
0:9:40,2 --> 0:9:41,71
I wouldn't want to write that.


219
0:9:41,71 --> 0:9:44,24
So I am trying to--


220
0:9:44,24 --> 0:9:47,81
I'm filtering it through
the cheese grater of my


221
0:9:47,81 --> 0:9:50,93
joke-writing-trained mind
to make sure that it is


222
0:9:50,93 --> 0:9:51,7
entertaining.


223
0:9:51,7 --> 0:9:56,35
Because as a comedian, it's my
job that everything that I do


224
0:9:56,35 --> 0:10:0,49
be funny, and at the very
least compelling


225
0:10:0,49 --> 0:10:1,74
and pull you along.


226
0:10:1,74 --> 0:12:1,74
