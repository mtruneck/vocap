###2 SO DEADLY
###4 IS NOT■■HEIR FANGS OR THEIR VENOM, BUT THEIR WEBS--
###7 THOSE GRACEFUL STRANDS OF SILK.
###10 NOW, A COUSIN OF THESE SPIDERS SPIN WEBS THAT ARE SO STRONG
###13 THEY'RE USED AS FISH NETS
###15 ON SOME ISLANDS IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC.
###18 IN F EVEN
###18 IGHT.
###21 THIS WEEK WE ENTER THE DELICATE WORLD
###23 OF THE LOVELIEST DEATHTRAP-- THE WEB OF THE SPIDER.
###40 Narrator: IT IS AN ANCIENT CREATURE
###43 AS OLD AS ANY WALKING THE EARTH.
###47 THROUGH THE AGES, IT HAS BECOME AN EXPERT WEAVER...
###54 A CONSUMMATE HUNTER
###56 AND, WITH MORE THAN 30,000 DIFFERENT FACES
###60 A MASTER OF ADAPTATION.
###64 IT LIVES ALL AROUND US-- IN OUR BACKYARDS AND GARDENS
###69 EVEN INSIDE OUR HOMES.
###72 YET MOST PEOPLE ARE TERRIFIED BY THIS SOLITARY SPINNER
###75 AND ONLY A FEW KNOW THE INNER WORKINGS OF THE SPIDER'S WORLD.
###91 LONG BEFORE THE DINOSAURS
###94 SPIDERS WERE ALREADY USING SILK TO CATCH THEIR PREY.
###98 FROM THOSE FIRST RANDOM SNARES, THE CLASSIC ORB WEB EVOLVED.
###107 THE SPIDER BEGINS BY RELEASING A STRAND OF SILK
###110 THAT IS
###110 RRENTS
###124 AN ORB CAN TAKE AN HOUR OR MORE TO MAKE.
###127 HERE, THE PROCESS IS COMPRESSED INTO A MINUTE.
###132 FIRST THE SPIDER LAYS DOWN A SET OF LINES RADIATING FROM A HUB
###138 LIKE THE SPOKES OF A WHEEL.
###142 AFTER MAKING A LOOSE SCAFFOLDING
###144 SHE MOVES INWARDS AND CRAFTS A TIGHTER SPIRAL.
###147 THE SILK IS STICKIER NOW--
###149 THE KIND THAT WILL GLUE HER VICTIMS TO THE WEB.
###179 ALL SPIDERS SPIN, BUT WEBS CAN VARY GREATLY
###183 EACH BEARING THE SIGNATURE OF ITS MAKER.
###204 ONE OF THE MOST UNMISTAKABLE
###206 IS THE HOME OF THE AUSTRALIAN LEAF CURLER.
###209 SHE DESCENDS TO THE FOREST FLOOR BY NIGHT
###212 TO GATHER BUILDING SUPPLIES.
###219 THE SPIDER ATTACHES A LEAF TO THE SAME SILKEN CORD
###222 THAT BROUGHT HER TO THE GROUND.
###224 THEN, LIKE A HIGH-RISE CONSTRUCTION WORKER
###227 SHE HAULS IT SEVERAL FEET INTO THE AIR.
###241 THE LEAF WILL BECOME THE CENTERPIECE OF HER NEW WEB
###245 BUT FIRST SHE MUST MAKE SOME ALTERATIONS.
###255 THE LEAF IS COVERED WITH SILK
###258 WHICH WHEN DRY, WILL CURL THE LEAF INTO PROPER SHAPE.
###265 THE JOB CAN TAKE HOURS
###266 BUT SPIDERS SEEM TO HAVE INFINITE PATIENCE.
###281 WITH HER RETREAT FINISHED, THE SPIDER CAN TURN HER ATTENTION
###286 TO A MORE PRESSING MATTER-- HER NEXT FEEDING.
###289 HER INSECT TRAP IS SET OUTSIDE HER FRONT DOOR.
###303 WEB SPIDERS HAVE EXTREMELY POOR SIGHT
###306 PERCEIVING MOST OF THEIR WORLD BY TOUCH INSTEAD.
###310 IT WAS BY THAT SENSE ALONE THAT THE LEAF CURLER FOUND HER LEAF
###315 AND CHANGED ITS SHAPE
###316 AND IT IS BY TOUCH NOW
###318 THAT SHE WEAVES THE INTRICATE FABRIC OF HER LAIR.
###324 AND THERE IT IS, THE PERFECT WEB--
###327 A WORK OF ART TO US, A DEADLY SNARE FOR INSECTS
###332 AND FOR THE SPIDER, THE ONLY MEANS OF SURVIVAL.
###340 SPIDERS ARE OPPORTUNISTIC.
###342 AND IF THEY CAN FIND A SHORTCUT, THEY'LL TAKE IT.
###344 INSTEAD OF A LEAF AT THE HUB, THIS LEAF CURLER HAS SUBSTITUTED
###349 A PREFAB STRUCTURE-- AN EMPTY SNAIL SHELL.
###355 MOST PEOPLE CAN RECOGNIZE A SPIDER BY ITS EIGHT LEGS
###359 BUT THERE ARE OTHER COMMON CHARACTERISTICS AS WELL.
###362 ALL USE SPINNERETS FOR MAKING SILK.
###365 THE ONES ON THIS RELATIVE OF THE TARANTULA ARE UNUSUALLY LONG.
###372 EVERY SPIDER'S BODY IS DIVIDED INTO TWO SEGMENTS:
###376 A HEAD WITH UP TO EIGHT EYES
###378 AND AN ABDOMEN, WHERE ITS VARIOUS SILK GLANDS LIE.<i> </i>
###382 DIFFERENT SILKS ARE USED FOR DIFFERENT NEEDS.
###386 A FEMALE WEAVING AN EGG SAC WILL LINE IT WITH HER SOFTEST SILK
###391 BUT COVER IT WITH HER TOUGHEST, FOR PROTECTION.
###398 A SILK THREAD CAN BE A SAFETY LINE
###400 WHEN A SPIDER DANGLES HIGH ABOVE THE GROUND
###404 AND SILK IS USED LIKE A TELEGRAPH--
###406 THE BETW
###406 NK
###414 AS NIGHT FALLS ON AN AUSTRALIAN SUBURB
###417 A LARGE FEMALE SPIDER COMES OUT OF HIDING.
###420 SHE HAS DEVELOPED A PARTICULARLY INGENIOUS USE FOR SILK.
###428 UNLIKE A WEB DWELLER, THE OGRE-FACED SPIDER
###431 DOESN'T WAIT FOR PREY TO WANDER INTO HER HOME.
###435 SHE IS A NET CASTER,<i> </i> AND HER WEB IS A MOBILE TRAP.
###445 AT NEARLY 200 STROKES A MINUTE
###447 SHE COMBS OUT A SPECIAL KIND OF SILK
###450 WITH A ROW OF BRISTLES ON HER LONG HIND LEGS.
###467 SHE ATTACHES THE FINISHED THREADS
###470 AND STARTS COMBING WITH THE OTHER LEG.
###474 WHAT STA IS N
###474 F SILK T.
###483 BUT HOW CAN A SCRAP OF FABRIC NO BIGGER THAN A POSTAGE STAMP
###488 CATCH ENOUGH FOOD FOR SUCH A LARGE SPIDER?
###503 SHE LIES IN AMBUSH ABOVE AN INSECT HIGHWAY.
###510 UNLIKE THE LEAF CURLER, HER NIGHT VISION IS EXCELLENT
###514 AND SHE'LL DETECT THE SLIGHTEST MOVEMENT BELOW.
###538 THIS LARGE ANT IS HOPELESSLY ENTANGLED
###541 BUT THE SPIDER, WARY OF ITS FEROCIOUS STING
###544 RESTRAINS IT EVEN MORE.
###558 THE OGRE-FACED SPIDER CAN MAKE SEVERAL CATCHES A NIGHT
###562 BUT FOR EACH ONE, SHE MUST WEAVE A BRAND-NEW NET.
###588 NOT EVERY SPIDER USES AN AIRBORNE ATTACK TO CATCH PREY.
###593 LIKE AN ENTRENCHED SOLDIER
###595 THE TRAP-DOOR SPIDER PREFERS TERRA FIRMA.
###598 ITS SILK-LINED BURROW CAN BE MORE THAN THREE FEET DEEP.
###608 RELYING ON ITS FEET TO DETECT THE VIBRATIONS
###613 OF PASSING INSECTS
###614 IT CAN DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN BUGS WITH AMAZING ACCURACY.
###624 LIKE VIRTUALLY ALL SPIDERS, THE TRAP-DOOR IS CARNIVOROUS.
###628 IT CAN GO WITHOUT FOOD FOR MONTHS IF NECESSARY
###631 BUT FOR THIS ONE, THE LONG SIEGE IS OVER.
###646 TRAP-DOOR SPIDERS AND THEIR CLOSE RELATIVES
###649 ARE DISTINGUISHED BY LARGE, DOWNWARD-STRIKING FANGS.
###653 VENOM IS PRODUCED AS DROPLETS AT THE TIP OF THE FANGS
###657 AND INJECTED WHEN THE SPIDER STRIKES.
###659 MOST ARE DEADLY ONLY TO INSECTS
###661 BUT THE BITE OF THE SYDNEY FUNNEL WEB
###664 CAN BE FATAL FOR PEOPLE AS WELL.
###673 FUNNEL WEBS HIDE IN BURROWS UNDER ROCKS AND LOGS.
###703 THE VENOM OF THE MALE FUNNEL WEB IS FIVE TIMES MORE TOXIC
###707 THAN THAT OF HIS FEMALE COUNTERPART.
###710 DURING THE BREEDING SEASON
###712 HE STRAYS AWAY FROM HIS HOME IN SEARCH OF A MATE
###715 BUT OCCASIONALLY MEETS HIS HUMAN NEIGHBORS INSTEAD.
###725 AN UNSUSPECTING GARDENER UNLEASHES A LETHAL THREAT
###728 WHEN HE DIGS UP ONE OF THESE SPIDERS AND SETS HIM WANDERING.
###757 THIS MAY LOOK LIKE A DANGEROUS GAME
###759 BUT THE CAT'S NOT REALLY AT RISK.
###762 AMONG THE BACKBONED ANIMALS
###764 ONLY PRIMATES ARE BELIEVED TO BE SUSCEPTIBLE TO FUNNEL WEB BITE
###769 WHICH IS BAD LUCK FOR PEOPLE.
###785 (<i> phone rings</i> )
###797 IF YOU KNOW HOW TO HANDLE THEM
###799 THERE IS ONE GOOD USE FOR A FUNNEL WEB.
###806 USING THE SPIDER'S OWN TOXIC VENOM
###808 SCIENTISTS HAVE FINALLY DISCOVERED AN ANTIVENIN.
###822 OUS
###825 IS THE BLACK WIDOW.
###827 THIS IS HER COUSIN, THE REDBACK.
###830 SHE BUILDS A PERMANENT TRAP OUT OF STRONG, VERTICAL THREADS
###835 BEADED AT THE BASE WITH A CONTACT ADHESIVE.
###838 IT'S AN INVISIBLE MAZE WITH NO WAY OUT BUT DEATH.
###846 THE ANT CLEANS ITS ANTENNAE, A SIGN THAT IT SENSES DANGER
###851 BUT ITS WARNING SYSTEM IS TOO LATE.<i> </i>
###854 ABOVE WAITS AN ASSASSIN.
###885 WITH A SPECIAL COMB
###887 REDBACK SPIDERS AND THEIR RELATIVES TIE UP THEIR VICTIMS.
###896 IN SLOW MOTION, THE SILK APPEARS AS A RIBBON OF RAINBOW COLORS
###902 BUT TO THE ANT, IT IS SIMPLY A SHROUD.
###913 <i> THIS SPIDER ISN'T  STALKING AN INSECT.</i>
###915 <i> IT'S UNSUSPECTING VICTIM  IS A FISH.</i>

###1160 Narrator: IN THE COURSE OF EVOLUTION, INSECTS DEVELOPED FLIGHT
###1164 AND SPIDERS FOLLOWED THEM UPWARDS-- NOT WITH WINGS
###1168 BUT WITH ALL KINDS OF AERIAL TRAPS AND SNARES.■
###1171 FOUND IN WARM CLIMATES THE WORLD OVER
###1174 SPECIES OF NEPHILA ARE AMONG THE BIGGEST SPIDERS IN THE WORLD
###1178 MEASURING UP TO TEN INCHES ACROSS.
###1180 THEY OFTEN BUILD THEIR ENORMOUS WEBS IN TROPICAL GARDENS
###1185 WHERE EXOTIC FLOWERS ATTRACT HUGE MOTHS AND BUTTERFLIES.
###1202 THIS MASSIVE SPIDER'S WEB IS SO STRONG
###1205 THAT IT HAS BEEN KNOWN TO TRAP SMALL BIRDS
###1209 BUT ITS INTENDED PREY ARE LARGE INSECTS.
###1226 SLOW
###1226  CAUGHT
###1228 BUT EVEN THE WORLD'S FASTEST FLYING INSECT, THE DRAGONFLY
###1232 IS STOPPED COLD BY THIS SUPER WEB.
###1236 THESE SILKEN THREADS MAY LOOK DELICATE
###1239 BUT THEY HAVE THE TENSILE STRENGTH OF STEEL.
###1261 USUALLY ANYTHING MOVING ABOUT IN A WEB IS FAIR GAME
###1265 BUT THESE LITTLE SPIDERS FEED FEARLESSLY ON NEPHILAS' CRUMBS.
###1271 THEIR RELATIONSHIP IS KNOWN AS COMMENSALISM
###1275 WHICH LITERALLY MEANS "FEEDING AT THE SAME TABLE."
###1280 THE COMMENSALS CLEAN THE WEB OF TINY UNWANTED INSECTS.
###1284 IN RETURN, THEY GET PART OF THEIR GIANT HOSTESS'S FEAST.
###1294 BUT FOR REAL COMMUNITY SPIRIT
###1296 NO SPIDER CAN MATCH THE CRYTOPHORA.
###1298 SPIDERS ARE GENERALLY AN ANTISOCIAL LOT
###1301 BUT THIS SOUTH SEAS NATIVE SHARES ITS GARGANTUAN WEB
###1305 WITH HUNDREDS OF ITS KIND.
###1310 WITHIN THE WEB
###1311 EACH CRYTOPHORA DEFENDS ITS OWN TERRITORY AND ORB
###1315 BUT THEIR HOMES ARE ALL LINKED TOGETHER
###1318 TO FORM WHAT LOOKS LIKE A FLOATING CITY.
###1352 MANY FOREST SPIDERS USE
###1353 NEITHER WEBS NOR NETS TO CAPTURE THEIR PREY
###1356 BUT DEPEND RATHER ON SPEED.
###1358 THIS TREE TRUNK IS A PROMISING SITE FOR THE SMALL TAMA SPIDER.
###1378 SHE WRESTLES AN ANT BETWEEN HER TWO TAIL-LIKE SPINNERETS
###1382 AND THEN TIES IT UP WITH SILK.
###1388 SHE MOVES IN FOR THE KILL
###1390 BITING HER VICTIM BEFORE EATING IT.
###1395 TAMA IS NOT ALWAYS SO FRENETIC.
###1398 WHEN SHE'S NOT HUNTING
###1400 SHE SITS SO STILL SHE IS NEARLY IMPERCEPTIBLE.
###1418 JUMPING SPIDERS ARE THE AERIAL ACROBATS OF THE SPIDER WORLD.
###1422 LAUNCHING THEMSELVES AT HIGH SPEED
###1425 THEY LEAP ACROSS OPEN SPACES
###1428 BUT IF ONE MISSES ITS MARK, A SAFETY LINE IS ALWAYS AT HAND.
###1441 OF THEIR EIGHT EYES,<i> </i> TWO ARE DRAMATICALLY ENLARGED
###1444 GIVING THEM GOOD VISION FOR DAYTIME HUNTING
###1447 AS WELL AS A FRIENDLY APPEARANCE.
###1452 JUMPING SPIDERS ARE FOUND ALL OVER THE WORLD.
###1455 MOST ARE LESS THAN HALF AN INCH LONG AND ARE STRIKINGLY COLORED
###1460 BUT BECAUSE FEW MAKE WEBS, THEY'RE OFTEN OVERLOOKED.
###1467 LEAVES OF PLANTS ARE THEIR HUNTING GROUNDS.
###1471 A SUNBATHING FLY CAN BE A REAL CHALLENGE.
###1493 THE FLY PROVES TOO QUICK EVEN FOR A JUMPING SPIDER
###1496 BUT NO MATTER, JUMPERS AREN'T PICKY EATERS.
###1499 THEY'LL EVEN PREY ON OTHER SPIDERS.
###1529 SPIDERS HAVE EXPLOITED EVERY CORNER OF THE GLOBE
###1533 EXCEPT THE DEEP OCEANS.
###1534 FRESH WATER SUITS THE DOLOMEDES SPIDER JUST FINE, HOWEVER.
###1539 ITS DIET EVEN INCLUDES FISH.
###1545 THIS IS AN ANGLER THAT USES NO BAIT
###1548 AND SURPRISINGLY, NO SILKEN FISHING LINE.
###1553 THE HAIRS ON THE SPIDER'S LEGS ACT AS FLOATS.
###1556 THEY PREVENT HIM FROM SINKING THROUGH THE SURFACE FILM.
###1563 PATIENCE IS THE HALLMARK OF ANY GOOD FISHERMAN.
###1567 WHILE FISH SWIM BELOW, THE SPIDER WAITS FOR HIS MOMENT.
###1575 WHEN HE DIVES, THE AIR BUBBLES ON HIS LEG HAIRS
###1578 WILL DRAW HIM BACK UP TO THE SURFACE
###1580 SO HE DRIES HIS LEGS CAREFULLY BETWEEN PLUNGES.
###1587 THE FISH SEE ONLY A DISTORTED SHAPE ABOVE THEM
###1590 AND SHOW NO FEAR, AND THAT'S THEIR UNDOING.
###1604 SPIDERS CAN'T EAT SOLID FOOD.
###1607 THEY MUST CRUSH THEIR PREY AND PREDIGEST IT
###1610 THEN SUCK IT UP AS A LIQUID.
###1612 THIS ONE'S TURNING THE CATCH OF THE DAY INTO FISH SOUP.
###1620 <i> DON'T LOOK NOW-- THAT INNOCENT  BUMP ON A BRANCH</i>

###1846 Narrator: WHEREVER THERE ARE FLOWERS, INSECTS CAN BE FOUND
###1849 AND SPIDERS ARE BOUND TO FOLLOW.
###1862 THESE SPIDERS DON'T USE WEBS TO TRAP THEIR PREY.
###1865 THEY RELY INSTEAD ON CAMOUFLAGE AND THE FLOWER'S LURE.
###1890 SITTING ABSOLUTELY STILL
###1893 A FLOWER SPIDER MAY HAVE TO WAIT DAYS FOR SUITABLE QUARRY.
###1897 EVEN THEN, IT WON'T MAKE ITS MOVE
###1900 UNTIL ITS VICTIM IS AT THE PRECISE STRIKING DISTANCE.
###1933 EVEN AN INSECT MUCH LARGER THAN THE SPIDER
###1936 IS NOT SAFE FROM AMBUSH.
###1961 THE SPIDER'S DISGUISE IS SO GOOD
###1964 THAT IT EVEN FOOLS THIS BUTTERFLY INTO LANDING ON IT.
###1975 CKGROUND
###1979 TO DECEIVE A KEEN-EYED PREDATOR
###1982 A SPIDER PRETENDS IT IS SOMETHING INEDIBLE.
###1985 THE TRICK IS NOT TO MOVE.
###2001 ANY LUMP OR BUMP ON A TREE MAY TURN OUT TO BE A SPIDER.
###2006 THIS ONE APPEARS TO BE A BIRD DROPPING-- UNTIL IT WALKS AWAY.
###2015 WE OURSELVES ARE OFTEN UNAWARE OF THE SPIDERS AROUND US.
###2035 THE FLAT SHAPE AND CAMOUFLAGE PATTERN OF PANDERCETES
###2038 HELP CONCEAL IT.
###2040 HAIRS ON ITS LEGS BLUR THE SHADOW THAT MIGHT GIVE IT AWAY.
###2045 IN THIS CASE, THE DISGUISE IS NOT JUST FOR DEFENSE
###2049 AS A TINY BARK MANTIS IS ABOUT TO DISCOVER.
###2070 PLAYING WALLFLOWER MAY BE FINE FOR SOME
###2073 BUT OTHER SPIDERS HAVE TAKEN THE ART OF DECEPTION A STEP FURTHER.
###2078 YOU CAN TELL THIS IS AN ANT BY HER TWO ANTENNAE AND SIX LEGS.
###2085 BUT THIS ONE IS AN IMPOSTOR.
###2088 THE SPIDER WAVES TWO OF ITS EIGHT LEGS ABOUT
###2091 IMITATING THE ANT'S ANTENNAE.
###2101 THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF THESE ANT-MIMICKING SPIDERS.
###2105 EACH ONE SPECIFICALLY COPIES THE ANT IT PREYS ON.
###2123 THIS ONE IS A DOUBLE
###2124 FOR THE FIERCE WEAVER ANTS OF TROPICAL AUSTRALIA.
###2129 LIVING LIKE A SPY IN ENEMY TERRITORY
###2131 IT FEEDS ON THEM EXCLUSIVELY.
###2135 WHILE EATING AN ANT
###2136 THE SPIDER RETREATS SAFELY TO ITS SILK THREAD.
###2149 BUT THE NUMBERS ARE STACKED AGAINST THE SPIDER
###2152 AND SOMETIMES THE HUNTER BECOMES THE HUNTED.
###2163 WARY OF THE ANTS PATROLLING ABOVE
###2165 THE SPIDER DROPS DOWN HIS ESCAPE ROPE.
###2173 IT RARELY HAPPENS
###2175 BUT THIS TIME THE TABLES ARE TURNED ON THE SPIDER.
###2199 ANOTHER AUSTRALIAN SPIDER
###2201 ACTUALLY SEEMS TO SPEAK THE LANGUAGE OF HER PREY.
###2207 SHE FEEDS ON MEAT ANTS, WHICH LIVE IN LARGE MOUNDED NESTS
###2211 AT THE CENTER OF WELL-WORN FORAGING TRACKS.
###2219 FROM HER UNIQUELY SHAPED WEB
###2221 THIS INDUSTRIOUS CREATURE EARNED HER NAME:
###2225 THE LOBSTER POT SPIDER.
###2230 WHEN AN ANT COMES TO INVESTIGATE HER LAIR, THE SPIDER EMERGES.
###2236 SHE APPEARS TO TAP OUT A MESSAGE IN ANT FASHION
###2241 BUT FOR NOW, HER GREETING GOES UNANSWERED.
###2260 AGAIN THE SPIDER TAPS OUT HER TACTILE INVITATION
###2263 AND
###2263 ANT
###2283 THE UNSUSPECTING GUEST IS SEIZED AND EATEN.
###2299 THE BOLAS SPIDER IS EVEN MORE DEVIOUS
###2301 ATTRACTING HER VICTIMS WITH AN IRRESISTIBLE BAIT.
###2315 THE CLASSIC ORB WEB OF HER ANCESTORS
###2318 HAS EVOLVED INTO A SINGLE THREAD IN HER SPECIES.
###2328 SHE DANGLES IT LIKE A FISHING LINE BEADED WITH STICKY DROPS.
###2336 IT SEEMS LIKE A POOR WAY TO CATCH A FLYING INSECT
###2340 AND THE BOLAS FEEDS ONLY ON MALE MOTHS OF A PARTICULAR KIND.
###2346 INCREDIBLY, THE SPIDER LURES HER PREY
###2350 WITH BY FEMAL
###2350  MATING.
###2360 WHEN THE MALE MOTH HOMES IN ON THIS SINGULAR PERFUME
###2399 THE MOTH ENDS UP IN THE ARMS OF A VERY DIFFERENT FEMALE
###2403 THAN HE SET OUT TO MEET.
###2411 THOUGH FEMALES DOMINATE THE LORE OF SPIDERS
###2414 MALES DO HAVE ONE VERY IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY.
###2420 ON A SPECIAL WEB, THIS LARGE-JAWED SPIDER
###2423 IS DEPOSITING A DROPLET OF WHITE SPERM FLUID.
###2434 IT FLOWS FROM THE SPIDER'S GENITAL OPENING
###2437 HALFWAY ALONG HIS BODY.
###2442 NOW HE PICKS THE DROPLET OFF THE SPERM WEB
###2445 AND DRAWS THE FLUID INTO THE MATING ORGANS ON HIS FEELERS
###2448 KNOWN AS PALPS.
###2463 HIS PREPARATIONS COMPLETE
###2465 THE MALE IS NOW READY
###2477 DOWN IN THE GRASS, A LINK SPIDER TRIES TO CHARM A FEMALE.
###2481 LIKE ALL SPIDERS THAT HUNT BY DAY
###2483 THEIR MATING HABITS ARE VERY VISUAL.
###2491 THE FEMALE WATCHES INTENTLY.
###2493 SHE WON'T RESPOND UNTIL HE'S ESTABLISHED HIMSELF
###2496 AS ONE OF HER OWN KIND.
###2511 WAVING HIS CONSPICUOUS BLACK PALPS, HE SIGNALS HIS INTENT.
###2517 HE TAPS THE FEMALE WITH HIS HAIRY FRONT LEGS
###2519 AND SHE SEEMS INTRIGUED.
###2539 BUT APPARENTLY SHE WAS ONLY LEADING HIM ON.
###2550 THE MOST ELEGANT RITUALS OF SPIDER COURTSHIP
###2552 ARE FOUND AMONG THE JUMPING SPIDERS.
###2564 THE MATE OF THIS LITTLE FEMALE FROM THE TROPICS
###2567 NED
###2569 BY HIS BLACK FACE AND WHITE SIDE WHISKERS
###2572 MUST
###2574 NOT WITH HIS PALPS THIS TIME
###2576 BUT WITH HIS DISTINCTIVE BLACK LEGS.
###2586 HE MUST FIRST CAPTURE HER FULL ATTENTION.
###2589 PERHAPS BECAUSE SHE'S MORE INTERESTED
###2592 IN CATCHING FLIES THAN A MATE
###2595 THIS IS HARD TO DO, BUT HE'S PERSISTENT AND FOLLOWS HER.
###2602 HE MAKES PRECISE, RITUALIZED MOVEMENTS WITH HIS FRONT LEGS...
###2616 BUT SHE STILL SEEMS ALOOF.
###2631 EVENTUALLY, THE FEMALE LETS HIM ADVANCE AND STROKE HER HEAD.
###2635 THE MASSAGE PUTS HER INTO A TRANCELIKE STATE
###2638 AND THE MALE IS AT LAST ABLE TO TILT HER ABDOMEN
###2642 AND PROCEED WITH MATING.
###2649 WHILE THE EXACT RITUALS OF COURTSHIP
###2652 ARE UNIQUE TO EACH SPECIES
###2654 ALL SPIDERS ARE HIGHLY SENSITIVE TO TOUCH AND VIBRATIONS
###2658 SO COMMUNICATION BETWEEN MALES AND FEMALES IS USUALLY TACTILE.
###2665 THIS MALE NET-CASTING SPIDER IS ON THE LINE TO A POTENTIAL MATE.
###2672 HE PRESENTS HIS CREDENTIALS
###2675 IN THE SPECIAL LANGUAGE OF HIS KIND...
###2677 AND WINS HER OVER.
###2680 THIS TANGLE OF 16 LEGS LOOKS A BIT AWKWARD
###2684 BUT THE SPIDERS KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE DOING.
###2693 WITH HIS PALP SWELLING LIKE A BALLOON
###2695 THE MALE FERTILIZES HIS MATE.
###2718 THE COILED DUCT, OR EMBOLUS THAT DELIVERS THE SPERM
###2721 IS RETRACTED BACK INTO THE PALP.
###2723 SOON THE WHOLE PROCESS WILL BE REPEATED WITH THE OTHER PALP.
###2733 BY STORING ENOUGH SPERM FOR SEVERAL BATCHES OF EGGS
###2748 BUT MALES CAN MATE SEVERAL TIMES.
###2750 THIS ONE'S CLEANING HIS PALPS
###2752 SO HE'LL BE READY FOR HIS NEXT ALLIANCE.
###2758 <i> WHEN SOME MALE  SPIDERS GO COURTING</i>
###2760 <i> THEY'RE ALSO COURTING DEATH.</i>

###2936 WHEN THE SEXES ARE ABOUT THE SAME SIZE, THIS SELDOM OCCURS
###2940 BUT THE FEMALE SAINT ANDREWS CROSS SPIDER
###2943 IS A GIANT COMPARED WITH HER MATE.
###2950 AND THE MALE THAT COURTS HER COURTS DEATH.
###2956 WHEN A POTENTIAL SUITOR APPROACHES A FEMALE
###2959 HE MUST QUICKLY IDENTIFY HIMSELF AS A MALE RATHER THAN A MEAL.
###2966 HE SITS VERY STILL ON THE OPPOSITE FACE OF HER WEB.
###2973 HE'S MADE A HOLE IN IT
###2975 SO HE CAN MAKE A DASH FOR SAFETY IF SHE ATTACKS.
###2985 RISKING LIFE AND LIMB, HE PERFORMS A MATING DANCE.
###3008 ONTO
###3011 THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE WEB.
###3013 HE PLUCKS A TACTILE SERENADE ON A SILK THREAD
###3017 AND SHE
###3017  FEET.
###3023 HIS LOVE SONG HAS WORKED AND THEY BEGIN TO MATE.
###3031 BUT THERE'S SOMETHING SINISTER GOING ON BEHIND HIS BACK.
###3035 WHY IS SHE PULLING OUT A SILK NOOSE?
###3042 SENSING TREACHERY, HE LEAPS AWAY.
###3050 THE MALE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN KNOCKED OFF BALANCE
###3053 BY THIS DANGEROUS LIAISON.
###3054 IN FACT, HE'S ONLY GOT SEVEN LEGS LEFT.
###3059 THE FEMALE'S EATING THE EIGHTH ONE.
###3063 STILL, THE DRIVE TO REPRODUCE IS OVERWHELMING.
###3068 THE MALE MAKES ANOTHER ATTEMPT.
###3070 IF HE'S LUCKY, HE'LL SUCCEED.
###3072 IF HE'S EVEN LUCKIER,
###3081 ONE THING IS CERTAIN: A MALE SAINT ANDREWS CROSS SPIDER
###3086 IS UNLIKELY TO DIE OF OLD AGE.
###3094 THOUGH SOME FEMALES DISPLAY
###3096 OUTRIGHT HOSTILITY TOWARD THEIR MATES
###3098 THEY ARE DEVOTED TO THEIR OFFSPRING.
###3102 ALL SPIDERS ENCLOSE THEIR EGGS
###3104 IN AN EGG SAC LINED WITH THE SOFTEST SILK.
###3107 BUT THE NURSERY OF THE WOLF SPIDER
###3109 MUST ALSO HAVE A TOUGH EXTERIOR.
###3112 LIKE HER NAMESAKE, THIS SPIDER IS ALWAYS ON THE MOVE.
###3118 SHE MUST DRAG IT ALONG WHEREVER SHE GOES
###3121 LIKE A BABY CARRIAGE IN REVERSE.
###3123 VERY FEW SPIDERS RISK
###3125 PUTTING ALL THEIR EGGS IN ONE BASKET, HOWEVER.
###3128 A BOLAS SPIDER MAY CREATE MANY EGG SACS EACH YEAR.
###3136 POURING LIKE WATER FROM A TAP
###3138 THESE EGGS ARE JUST A FEW OF THE SEVERAL THOUSAND
###3141 THAT THE MOTHER WILL LAY IN A SINGLE SEASON.
###3151 EGG SACS ARE AS DISTINCT AS THE DIFFERENT SPECIES OF SPIDER.
###3156 THE NET-CASTER ROTATES HERS AS SHE WEAVES.
###3171 SHE SEES NOTHING OF WHAT SHE'S DOING.
###3173 THROUGH TOUCH ALONE
###3175 SHE CRAFTS A PERFECTLY OVAL CRADLE FOR HER BABIES.
###3182 PROGRESSIVE LAYERS ARE MADE FROM DIFFERENT SILKS.
###3194 LIKE A JEWEL BOX, A SPIDER'S EGG SAC IS OPENED
###3198 TO REVEAL EMERALD GREEN SPIDERLINGS.
###3205 THE NEWBORNS STAY CLOSE TO THEIR ABANDONED NURSERY
###3208 UNTIL THEY'VE MOLTED.
###3210 THERE'S SAFETY IN NUMBERS.
###3219 AFTER SEVERAL WEEKS OF BEING PROTECTED
###3221 FROM THE ELEMENTS AND PREDATORS, THESE YOUNGSTERS HAVE EMERGED
###3226 INTO A WORLD FRAUGHT WITH HAZARD.
###3238 THE FEMALE HUNTSMAN SPIDER HAS A STRONG MATERNAL INSTINCT.
###3242 SHE GUARDS HER YOUNG AND PROVIDES THEM WITH FOOD
###3245 AS THEY GATHER AROUND HER MOUTH.
###3247 ANY DISTURBANCE SETS OFF A CHAIN REACTION IN THE CLUSTER.
###3274 THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE TO BREAK OUT OF THE SAC BY THEMSELVES.
###3278 THEIR MOTHER OPENS IT FOR THEM.
###3281 SHE KEEPS THE HATCHLINGS CLOSE BY AT ALL TIMES.
###3284 CLINGING TO SPECIAL HAIRS ON HER ABDOMEN
###3287 THEY RIDE PIGGYBACK EVERYWHERE.
###3298 AS SEASON FOLLOWS SEASON ALL AROUND THE WORLD
###3302 NEW GENERATIONS OF SPIDERS EXPLODE INTO LIFE AND DISPERSE.
###3330 MOST WILL LIVE ONLY BRIEFLY, PREYED ON BY BIRDS, INSECTS
###3335 AND EVEN THEIR OWN KIND
###3336 BUT THOSE THAT DO SURVIVE WILL NEED NO APPRENTICESHIP
###3340 IN SPIDERLY CRAFTS.
###3343 A BABY BOLAS SPIDER ALREADY
###3347 SHE'S SM
###3347 TIP.
###3350 AND THE SCENT SHE USES FOR BAIT
###3352 NOW LURES A MUCH SMALLER KIND OF MOTH.
###3356 A YOUNG NET-CASTING SPIDER MAKES A PERFECT MINIATURE NET.
###3361 A TINY ORB-WEAVING SPIDER
###3363 A BORN ENGINEER WITH A GENETIC BLUEPRINT
###3366 IS MAKING ITS VERY FIRST WEB.
###3372 THINGS CAN GET CONFUSING IN A CONFINED SPACE
###3375 WITH SO MANY SIBLINGS AROUND.
###3395 BUT SOON IT ALL GOES LIKE CLOCKWORK.
###3412 THESE LITTLE SPIDERS WILL EVENTUALLY SPREAD OUT
###3415 INTO THEIR SEPARATE TERRITORIES.
###3418 MANY WILL SPAN THE EARTH ON SILKEN BRIDGES.
###3421 OTHERS WILL LAUNCH THEMSELVES INTO THE AIR
###3424 TO BE CARRIED FAR AND WIDE
###3426 BUT ALL WILL BE THE SCOURGE OF INSECTS--
###3429 MASTERS OF DECEPTION AND WEAVERS OF WONDER.
###3441 THAT SPECTACULAR SPIDER FOOTAGE
###3443 IS THE WORK OF A UNIQUE TEAM OF FILMMAKERS:
###3445 AUSTRALIANS JIM FRAZIER AND DENSEY CLYNE.
###3448 WHEN WE COME BACK, WE'RE GOING TO TAKE YOU
###3451 FOR A SPECIAL LOOK AT THEIR WORLD.

###3682 AUSTRALIANS JIM FRAZIER AND DENSEY CLYNE
###3685 ARE ONE OF THE PREMIER COUPLES OF THE FILMMAKING WORLD.
###3689 THEY'RE MARRIED-- NOT TO EACH OTHER--
###3691 BUT TO A WORLD MOST PEOPLE NEVER SEE:
###3693 THE WORLD OF MICRO-ACTION
###3695 WHERE THE STARS ARE CATERPILLARS, SPIDERS
###3698 AND THE OCCASIONAL RIFLEBIRD.
###3700 AND NOW, JIM AND DENSEY BEHIND THE WEB.
###3709 Narrator: TO BE IN PICTURES, A SPIDER'S GOT TO LOOK TERRIFIC.
###3716 AND TO BE DAZZLING ENOUGH FOR THE MOVIES
###3719 EVEN NATURE NEEDS PROFESSIONAL HELP.
###3726 MAKING SOME OF THE SMALLEST CREATURES
###3728 LOOK THEIR BEST ON CAMERA
###3730 IS THE BUSINESS OF THESE TWO AUSTRALIANS...
###3735 AND THEY'RE GOOD AT IT.
###3746 JIM FRAZIER AND DENSEY CLYNE
###3748 ARE AWARD-WINNING WILDLIFE FILMMAKERS.
###3750 HE'S A CAMERAMAN.
###3752 SHE'S A NATURALIST AND WRITER
###3754 WHO BEGAN HER CAREER AS A STILL PHOTOGRAPHER.
###3757 Clyne: MOST OF MY PHOTOGRAPHY
###3758 IS DONE OUTDOORS
###3760 BECAUSE I LIKE TO BE OUT IN THE BUSH
###3762 AND I LIKE TO FIND THE INSECTS DOING THEIR THING
###3765 AND PHOTOGRAPH THEM NATURALLY.
###3767 BUT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN I HAVE TO USE A STUDIO SETUP.
###3771 WITH VERY SMALL INSECTS, YOU CAN CONTROL THEM MUCH BETTER
###3775 IF YOU'VE GOT THEM, FOR INSTANCE, ON A STEM OR A LEAF--
###3779 CONFINED TO THAT AREA.
###3782 THEY'RE REALLY AT YOUR MERCY.
###3785 SO THERE YOU CAN LET YOUR HEAD GO
###3787 AND YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO GET A SHOT.
###3790 Narrator: JIM'S SPECIALTY IS MOVING PICTURES.
###3794 Frazier: I BECAME INTERESTED IN PHOTOGRAPHY
###3797 APPROXIMATELY 20 YEARS AGO.
###3799 DENSEY WAS INTRODUCED TO ME
###3801 AND SHE WAS TAKING THESE WONDERFUL PHOTOGRAPHS
###3804 AND I THOUGHT, "GEE, I'D LOVE TO HAVE A GO AT THAT"
###3808 AND I'D NEVER EVEN HANDLED A CAMERA BEFORE.
###3812 AND WHEN I FINALLY STARTED WORKING WITH DENSEY
###3816 SHE TAUGHT ME THE RUDIMENTS OF PHOTOGRAPHY
###3819 AND I GUESS MY WHOLE CAREER GREW FROM THAT POINT ON.
###3824 Narrator: FOR JIM TO ACTUALLY PRODUCE THE SHOTS HE DREAMS UP
###3828 HE'S BECOME MORE THAN A CINEMATOGRAPHER.
###3831 HE'S ALSO AN INVENTOR.
###3833 Frazier: ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH FILMING WILDLIFE IS
###3837 THAT MOST OF THE LENSES THAT ARE AVAILABLE ON THE SHELVES
###3842 DON'T NECESSARILY DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO<i> </i>
###3845 SO I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN FORCED TO BUILD LENSES
###3848 TO DO THE SORTS OF THINGS THAT I'VE ENVISAGED.
###3851 ONE OF THE SUCCESSFUL LENSES IS THIS ONE.
###3854 FOR INSTANCE, IF YOU WANT A SHOT FROM GROUND LEVEL
###3857 LOOKING AT THE ACTUAL SPECIMEN IN FRONT
###3860 IT PUTS A LOT OF IT IN FOCUS
###3863 AND YOU GET THEIR EYE-VIEW OF THE WORLD.
###3872 NOW, THIS PARTICULAR ONE I'VE USED A LOT ON BUTTERFLIES
###3875 FLIES
###3875 .
###3880 BUT BY MOVING THE LENS LIKE THIS
###3883 YOU'RE ACTUALLY ACHIEVING CRANES.
###3886 THE LENS THAT HAS COME TO MOST ATTENTION
###3890 IS THIS LITTLE SECRET IN THE BLACK BOX.
###3893 Narrator: IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE
###3896 BUT DAVID ATTENBOROUGH ISN'T POSING WITH A MONSTER.
###3899 IT'S AN INCH-LONG CATERPILLAR.
###3902 THE ILLUSION IS A RESULT OF ONE OF JIM'S OPTICAL INNOVATIONS.
###3906 Frazier: I'VE COME UP WITH A CONFIGURATION
###3909 THAT PUTS INTO FOCUS EVERYTHING FROM AN ANT HERE
###3912 TO AN ELEPHANT OR MOUNTAINS IN THE BACKGROUND--
###3916 IT DOESN'T MATTER.
###3917 I'M REALLY PROUD OF THIS LITT
###3917  DOES.
###3920 Narrator: FOR THE PHOTOGRAPHERS AND THEIR ASSISTANT, JOHN YOUNG
###3925 FILMMAKING ISN'T ONLY FANCY EQUIPMENT AND SPECIAL EFFECTS.
###3930 IT'S ALSO HANDS-ON WORK IN THE FIELD.
###3937 .
###3939 Narrator: ON THIS MISSION, THEY WANT TO FILM A BUTTERFLY
###3942 AFTER IT EMERGES FROM ITS PUPA.
###3944 THE PROBLEM IS, THIS PARTICULAR PUPA LIVES EMBEDDED
###3947 IN A NEST OF WEAVER ANTS...
###3951 AND WEAVER ANTS STING.
###3956 RIGHT.
###3957 GOT ONE, JIM, LOOK!
###3959 Frazier: OH, GREAT, FANTASTIC!
###3964 Narrator: BACK IN THE STUDIO, JIM INVENTS A SYSTEM
###3967 THAT SOUNDS WHEN THE PUPA IS ABOUT TO BREAK.
###3971 (<i> alarm buzzing</i>  )
###3977 AT THE ALARM, ONLY ONE TASK REMAINS:
###3980 RETURNING THE PUPA TO A NEST FULL OF ANTS.
###3984 THESE, TOO.
###3985 OH, BEAUTY.
###3989 (<i> chirping</i>  )
###3994 OKAY.
###3995 HIT THE LIGHT, PLEASE.
###3997 OH, LOOK AT IT!
###3998 OH, BEAUTIFUL!
###4005 Narrator: THE FILMMAKERS GO TO A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE
###4008 BUT IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO GET PICTURES LIKE THESE.
###4017 THE PLACE WHERE JIM AND DENSEY DO MOST OF THEIR FIELDWORK
###4021 IS THE AUSTRALIAN RAIN FOREST.
###4027 THIS TIME THEY'RE AFTER A BIRD.
###4036 TO GET A GOOD VIEW CLOSE TO THE ACTION
###4040 THEY NEED A PLACE TO HIDE.
###4045 PLATFORMS IN THE TREETOPS ARE JOHN YOUNG'S SPECIALTY.
###4049 Young: IT'S AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS BUSINESS THAT I'M IN
###4053 BECAUSE OF THE CLIMBING ASPECTS.
###4055 ONE HAS TO BE SO CAREFUL
###4057 HE HAS TO KNOW THE TIMBER YOU CLIMB, THE TREES.
###4065 Frazier: THIS PARTICULAR TREE
###4066 WE'RE PUTTING A HIDE IN AT THE MOMENT
###4069 IT'S CALLED A CODAHI-- ONE OF THOSE REALLY BRITTLE GUMS
###4074 AND JOHN KNOWS THEM ONLY TOO WELL.
###4077 HE KNOWS WHAT SIZE BRANCH WILL SUPPORT WHAT WEIGHT
###4082 AND THAT'S WHAT I RELY ON.
###4084 SOME OF THESE THINGS, LIKE THIS ONE
###4086 WILL SNAP JUST LIKE A CARROT
###4088 AND THEY DON'T GIVE YOU ANY
###4100 Narrator: THE BIRD JIM AND DENSEY WANT TO FILM HAS BEEN ELUSIVE
###4104 AND IT'S KEPT THEM REVISITING THEIR HIDEOUT FOR MONTHS NOW--
###4108 OFTEN FOR DAYS AT A TIME.
###4111 Frazier: IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE PLEASANT
###4113 SITTING UP IN A HIDE IN THE RAIN FOREST FILMING.
###4116 YOU TEND TO NOTICE EVERYTHING THAT MOVES AROUND YOU
###4120 AND SO WHILE YOU MAY BE CONCENTRATING
###4123 ON ONE PARTICULAR SUBJECT
###4125 YOU CAN'T HELP BUT SEE
###4127 EVERYTHING ELSE THAT'S HAPPENING.
###4129 THAT'S THE FASCINATING PART
###4131 AND THAT KEEPS YOU ALIVE, THAT KEEPS YOU VIBRANT.
###4135 THES
###4135 TING
###4137 BUT THEY'RE NOT WHAT THE FILMMAKERS ARE LOOKING FOR.
###4140 THEY WANT THE RIFLEBIRD.
###4143 (<i> squawks</i> )
###4146 JIM WANTS TO FILM THIS BIRD MATING--
###4149 SOMETHING WHICH HAS NEVER BEEN PHOTOGRAPHED BEFORE.
###4153 ALL THE RIFLEBIRD WANTS IS A FEMALE.
###4210 JUST WHEN THE FEMALE SEEMS AGREEABLE, SHE CHANGES HER MIND.
###4216 (<i> screeches</i> )
###4223 THE RIFLEBIRD ISN'T THE ONLY ONE LET DOWN.
###4227 JIM AND DENSEY HAVE WAITED IN THE BLIND SEVEN DAYS FOR THIS.
###4231 BUT THE VERY NEXT DAY, EVERYONE GETS SATISFACTION.
###4245 THE RIFLEBIRD ESPECIALLY HAS SOMETHING TO CROW ABOUT.
###4257 SHOWING US NATURE'S SMALL CREATURES
###4259 AS WE RARELY SEE THEM
###4261 IS JIM AND DENSEY'S BUSINESS... AND THEIR PLEASURE.
###4264 IT'S A LIFE THEY ALMOST SEEM MADE FOR.
###4267 Clyne:
###4267 .
###4270 I LIKE TO FEEL FREE.
###4274 JIM AND I BOTH LIKE THAT BEST--
###4276 TO BE FREE, OUT THERE IN THE BUSH, WITH OUR CAMERAS
###4281 JUST LOOKING, SEEING WHAT WE CAN FIND.
###4287 Frazier: I GUESS I WOULDN'T SWAP IT
###4290 FOR ANY OTHER LIFE IN THE WORLD.
###4292 IT'S GREAT.
###4293 YOU DON'T MAKE A LOT OF MONEY OUT OF MAKING WILDLIFE FILMS.
###4297 IN FACT, YOU LIVE QUITE POORLY.
###4299 BUT THIS SORT OF LIFESTYLE
###4302 OF BEING OUT HERE LEARNING ABOUT ANIMALS
###4306 AND WATCHING ANIMALS DO EXTRAORDINARY THINGS--
###4311 THERE'S NO JOB IN AN OFFICE IN A CITY
