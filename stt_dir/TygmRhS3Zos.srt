1
0:0:5,85 --> 0:0:12,94
What are they fighting for?
If the war sells munitions, submarines


2
0:0:12,94 --> 0:0:15,19
yet you take the lives
of American soldiers


3
0:0:15,19 --> 0:0:18,757
and put them up
to defend the US.


4
0:0:18,757 --> 0:0:21,507
Are they defending the US


5
0:0:21,507 --> 0:0:25,663
or are they defending
the social institutions


6
0:0:25,663 --> 0:0:28,905
the war factories,
the war industries?


7
0:0:28,905 --> 0:0:30,714
Do you see what I mean?


8
0:0:30,714 --> 0:0:35,834
Merely marching in front of the
Stock Market or Stock Exchange


9
0:0:35,834 --> 0:0:38,364
is only part of this system.


10
0:0:38,364 --> 0:0:42,76
The public pays taxes.
They support the police


11
0:0:42,76 --> 0:0:45,428
the Army, the war
weapons, everything.


12
0:0:45,428 --> 0:0:48,316
The very rich pay
very little taxes


13
0:0:48,316 --> 0:0:50,744
yet they control the police


14
0:0:50,744 --> 0:0:55,81
and the National
Guard and the Army.


15
0:0:55,81 --> 0:0:57,958
It's the public that pays
the police's salary.


16
0:0:57,958 --> 0:1:0,912
I am told they arrested... - 700


17
0:1:0,912 --> 0:1:6,413
- By now, you say 700.
Well, that's interesting


18
0:1:6,413 --> 0:1:9,214
but remember the public
pays their salary.


19
0:1:9,214 --> 0:1:11,457
They don't know who they
hell they're serving.


20
0:1:11,457 --> 0:1:13,844
When they serve Wall
Street that means


21
0:1:13,844 --> 0:1:17,872
the money people really control
the country, not the public.


22
0:1:17,872 --> 0:1:20,65
80% of the people say


23
0:1:20,65 --> 0:1:24,411
they are not satisfied with
the government's decisions.


24
0:1:24,411 --> 0:1:30,4
If you walk in front of the
Stock Exchange, and you say


25
0:1:30,4 --> 0:1:33,63
that these people are corrupt,
the whole system is corrupt!


26
0:1:33,63 --> 0:1:35,329
You have to point
out these things.


27
0:1:35,329 --> 0:1:39,723
They want to cut
Medicare for the poor.


28
0:1:39,723 --> 0:1:44,71
"What do you suggest as an alternative?
Let them die?" Bring that up!


29
0:1:44,71 --> 0:1:46,188
"What do you suggest?"


30
0:1:46,188 --> 0:1:50,535
The guy that says "We don't want
to give people free medical care."


31
0:1:50,535 --> 0:1:54,458
"What do you want them to do?
Die? Yes or No?"


32
0:1:54,458 --> 0:1:57,596
They can't answer that


33
0:1:57,596 --> 0:2:2,657
so pin them down when they say


34
0:2:2,657 --> 0:2:5,603
"We love this country.
Our boys are out there fighting


35
0:2:5,603 --> 0:2:7,715
giving up their lives
for the country."


36
0:2:7,715 --> 0:2:11,442
"Don't you think we ought to
take the profit out of war also


37
0:2:11,442 --> 0:2:14,904
just like the guys don't make
money fighting over there?"


38
0:2:14,904 --> 0:2:18,245
They get minimum wage fighting.


39
0:2:18,245 --> 0:2:22,862
When you figure out
the cost of war


40
0:2:22,862 --> 0:2:27,345
all the aircraft carriers, all the
airplanes, all the cities destroyed


41
0:2:27,345 --> 0:2:29,72
and all the nations wiped out


42
0:2:29,72 --> 0:2:31,873
it's cheaper to take that money


43
0:2:31,873 --> 0:2:35,202
and build new cities all over
the world, helping people


44
0:2:35,202 --> 0:2:39,637
to understand the benefits
of technology and knowledge.


45
0:2:39,637 --> 0:2:43,33
The whole country is
involved in exploitation.


46
0:2:43,33 --> 0:2:47,378
If you are a dentist, you make money
on me if I need a root canal.


47
0:2:47,378 --> 0:2:50,119
If you dent your automobile,
somebody makes money


48
0:2:50,119 --> 0:2:54,55
straightening out the fenders.
Everything is profitable


49
0:2:54,55 --> 0:2:56,486
and we want that changed.


50
0:2:56,486 --> 0:3:0,111
We want the world to
concern itself with people


51
0:3:0,111 --> 0:3:4,467
and taking care of the environment.
It's the greatest gift we have:


52
0:3:4,467 --> 0:3:7,791
the trees, top soil, oceans


53
0:3:7,791 --> 0:3:12,649
where ships, luxury liners, empty
their bilge into the ocean.


54
0:3:12,649 --> 0:3:17,182
That means the oil and all the
stuff; they pump it into the ocean.


55
0:3:17,182 --> 0:3:20,132
The oceans are the
toilets of the world.


56
0:3:20,132 --> 0:3:25,438
All big hotels pump their fecal
matter out into the oceans.


57
0:3:25,438 --> 0:3:27,581
So what do you expect from that?


58
0:3:27,581 --> 0:3:30,938
Do you expect the dolphins to
live on [with] healthy lives?


59
0:3:30,938 --> 0:3:32,681
They can't.


60
0:3:32,681 --> 0:3:37,293
If you use genetic manipulation
without a long-term study


61
0:3:37,293 --> 0:3:40,57
of the effects of it, you
are going to hurt people.


62
0:3:40,57 --> 0:3:45,72
It's the system, not Wall Street.
The system produces all that.


63
0:3:45,72 --> 0:3:50,151
Therefore, we offer an alternative
system and this is what it is:


64
0:3:50,151 --> 0:3:54,853
to declare the Earth the common
heritage of all the world's people.


65
0:3:54,853 --> 0:3:57,138
For those of you
that are religious


66
0:3:57,138 --> 0:4:0,504
God didn't make the Earth for
the Greeks or the Polocks


67
0:4:0,504 --> 0:4:2,702
of the Jews or the French.


68
0:4:2,702 --> 0:4:5,542
He made it for all the
people of the world.


69
0:4:5,542 --> 0:4:8,544
Use religion, use it that way.


70
0:4:8,544 --> 0:4:12,186
You can find that in the Bible
"Love your enemy" it says.


71
0:4:12,186 --> 0:4:15,668
It says "Thou shall not
kill" in all Bibles


72
0:4:15,668 --> 0:4:18,207
and yet people don't
seem to follow that


73
0:4:18,207 --> 0:4:22,42
so apparently they don't
understand what they are reading.


74
0:4:22,42 --> 0:4:26,414
They believe in honesty
and good and fair-play.


75
0:4:26,414 --> 0:4:29,658
Where did we get this land?
We stole it from the Indians.


76
0:4:29,658 --> 0:4:34,841
Women who disagreed were burned as
witches in Salem, Massachusetts.


77
0:4:34,841 --> 0:4:38,768
The Ku Klux Klan in America
had 3 million members.


78
0:4:38,768 --> 0:4:41,541
If you don't bring that
up, that's a problem.


79
0:4:41,541 --> 0:4:44,881
The problem is that freedom


80
0:4:44,881 --> 0:4:48,868
and individual opinions
can become dangerous.


81
0:4:48,868 --> 0:4:52,318
I asked many people years
ago whether they thought


82
0:4:52,318 --> 0:4:56,387
man will ever get to the Moon.
They said "not in a thousand years."


83
0:4:56,387 --> 0:4:58,825
I said "Do you know anything
about rockets?" No.


84
0:4:58,825 --> 0:5:0,996
"Do you know anything
about space travel?" No.


85
0:5:0,996 --> 0:5:4,56
Well how do you formulate that?


86
0:5:4,56 --> 0:5:6,993
How come we give everybody a
right to their own opinion?


87
0:5:6,993 --> 0:5:10,814
Why don't you give them
access to information?


88
0:5:10,814 --> 0:5:14,605
Essentially, you have
to educate people


89
0:5:14,605 --> 0:5:18,932
teach them about the system, how
it works, where it's offensive.


90
0:5:18,932 --> 0:5:21,228
If a man commits a crime


91
0:5:21,228 --> 0:5:24,834
say he steals a watch worth $200


92
0:5:24,834 --> 0:5:28,962
it's his third offense, he
goes to jail for 7 years.


93
0:5:28,962 --> 0:5:33,158
It's cheaper to give him a watch
than feed him for 7 years


94
0:5:33,158 --> 0:5:35,992
and take care of his
medical problems


95
0:5:35,992 --> 0:5:38,147
and hotel, his food.


96
0:5:38,147 --> 0:5:42,665
Putting a man in jail is
cruel beyond description.


97
0:5:42,665 --> 0:5:46,974
It's confining a human,
taking away his life


98
0:5:46,974 --> 0:5:51,75
putting him there for 10 years,
some 20 years, some life in prison.


99
0:5:51,75 --> 0:5:54,451
The judge has no idea
what he's doing.


100
0:5:54,451 --> 0:5:58,88
He doesn't know the condition
that shaped that value system.


101
0:5:58,88 --> 0:6:1,621
If he knew where
that man came from


102
0:6:1,621 --> 0:6:4,503
if he knew the conditioning
of that man, he'd say


103
0:6:4,503 --> 0:6:8,47
"It's not his fault.
He was brought up to hate


104
0:6:8,47 --> 0:6:11,74
and kill and murder."


105
0:6:11,74 --> 0:6:14,168
It seems that all people
that kill and murder


106
0:6:14,168 --> 0:6:19,573
are really enacting the way
movies (all our cowboy pictures)


107
0:6:19,573 --> 0:6:22,997
[They] never sit down to discuss anything.
They shoot people.


108
0:6:22,997 --> 0:6:25,656
[They] have their two guns.
They shoot people.


109
0:6:25,656 --> 0:6:29,388
The Indians were fighting for
their land; we stole it from them


110
0:6:29,388 --> 0:6:34,416
but we shoot Indians, and we show
the guys in the covered wagons ...


111
0:6:34,416 --> 0:6:37,397
What the hell, are you taking
their land away from [them]?


112
0:6:37,397 --> 0:6:43,116
Why don't you ask them whether we can
settle down here? They said "No."


113
0:6:43,116 --> 0:6:45,256
We didn't ask them. We took it


114
0:6:45,256 --> 0:6:48,296
and we drove the Indians
into the desert region.


115
0:6:48,296 --> 0:6:50,598
They're still looking
for justice.


116
0:6:50,598 --> 0:6:55,374
The Indians aren't going to get
justice because they have no power.


117
0:6:55,374 --> 0:6:58,785
If they get an Indian
in the Congress


118
0:6:58,785 --> 0:7:2,7
if he doesn't conform to the
views of the Congressmen


119
0:7:2,7 --> 0:7:6,393
they'll move him out.
Do you understand?


120
0:7:6,393 --> 0:7:10,93
Now, as long as sports
exist: racing cars


121
0:7:10,93 --> 0:7:13,955
football, baseball,
they act as detractors.


122
0:7:13,955 --> 0:7:17,231
They detract people
from the real issues.


123
0:7:17,231 --> 0:7:19,872
They don't even know what
the real issues are.


124
0:7:19,872 --> 0:7:23,555
The real issues are to take
care of this God-given Earth


125
0:7:23,555 --> 0:7:27,72
if you're talking to them,
to take care of nature.


126
0:7:27,72 --> 0:7:29,614
God put the trees here
to give us oxygen.


127
0:7:29,614 --> 0:7:33,494
We give out carbon dioxide;
the trees use that.


128
0:7:33,494 --> 0:7:38,187
Use religion, whatever,
wherever they're at.


129
0:7:38,187 --> 0:7:41,947
Talk to them.
Say it's not going to change anything


130
0:7:41,947 --> 0:7:45,545
if you march in front of Wall Street,
but if you talk to other people


131
0:7:45,545 --> 0:7:49,448
and get a sufficient
amount of people organized


132
0:7:49,448 --> 0:7:51,778
to demand the Venus Project.


133
0:7:51,778 --> 0:7:56,91
When 80% of the people don't
trust their government anymore


134
0:7:56,91 --> 0:8:0,214
(what the Republicans
say about the Democrats


135
0:8:0,214 --> 0:8:2,616
or the Democrats say
about the Republicans)


136
0:8:2,616 --> 0:8:6,848
they just don't feel comfortable,
and they don't know what else to do


137
0:8:6,848 --> 0:8:11,384
so they would like to (like
the Arabs) change the culture


138
0:8:11,384 --> 0:8:14,584
but what do you change it to?
They don't know.


139
0:8:14,584 --> 0:8:17,554
If they succeed in
changing the culture


140
0:8:17,554 --> 0:8:20,701
it'll revert back
to the old values


141
0:8:20,701 --> 0:8:25,199
unless you teach them about
the new value system.


142
0:8:25,199 --> 0:8:30,424
Then they say "Well, they've tried
that for years and it never worked."


143
0:8:30,424 --> 0:8:34,146
Who tried it? When did they try it?
Pin them down.


144
0:8:34,146 --> 0:8:36,234
"Well, I don't know..."


145
0:8:36,234 --> 0:8:41,257
Say "I'm not interested in your
opinion, I want facts!" OK?


146
0:8:41,257 --> 0:8:43,506
And they'll try to detract you.


147
0:8:43,506 --> 0:8:47,272
They'll say "It will kill incentive.
" "Have you ever tried it?"


148
0:8:47,272 --> 0:8:52,221
"No, Russia has." "Well, Russia
didn't have the resources we have


149
0:8:52,221 --> 0:8:55,797
and they didn't steal the
land; it was their land."


150
0:8:55,797 --> 0:9:0,162
Russia had men pulling boats
along the Volga River.


151
0:9:0,162 --> 0:9:2,854
Did you know that?
They had no power system.


152
0:9:2,854 --> 0:9:6,858
Life was so miserable for
the majority of people


153
0:9:6,858 --> 0:9:9,69
they took to an ideal that


154
0:9:9,69 --> 0:9:12,459
if the people owned the
means of production


155
0:9:12,459 --> 0:9:14,624
they wouldn't hurt each other


156
0:9:14,624 --> 0:9:18,68
so they tried this social
experiment and they failed


157
0:9:18,68 --> 0:9:22,31
because they didn't know how
precisely to carry it out


158
0:9:22,31 --> 0:9:24,59
to attain what they wanted.


159
0:9:24,59 --> 0:9:27,1
If the socialists got into power


160
0:9:27,1 --> 0:9:29,937
they'd be concerned
about the working man.


161
0:9:29,937 --> 0:9:34,195
If automation came up they'd say "No,
we have to have people working,"


162
0:9:34,195 --> 0:9:36,732
and other nations
will pass us by


163
0:9:36,732 --> 0:9:41,821
surpass us, because
they put in automation.


164
0:9:41,821 --> 0:9:45,625
When you get new machines that
work everything in the factory


165
0:9:45,625 --> 0:9:49,161
(let's say you've got 3,000
people working in it)


166
0:9:49,161 --> 0:9:55,28
[but] now you got 1500, and
machines are assembling cars.


167
0:9:55,28 --> 0:9:58,599
You have to point out that
if new machines come in


168
0:9:58,599 --> 0:10:0,956
you'll get the workers
together and say:


169
0:10:0,956 --> 0:10:5,592
"Instead of working 8 hours,
you now work 4 hours a day


170
0:10:5,592 --> 0:10:8,333
and instead of getting
a week off every year


171
0:10:8,333 --> 0:10:12,361
you get 2 months off with your
family," and they'd get paid.


172
0:10:12,361 --> 0:10:15,357
That's what the machines
do, but if machines


173
0:10:15,357 --> 0:10:19,469
cause you to lose your job,
you're going to hate machines.


174
0:10:19,469 --> 0:10:22,151
Machines, when
used intelligently


175
0:10:22,151 --> 0:10:26,137
if they turn out 50 times
more than a man can turn out


176
0:10:26,137 --> 0:10:30,339
industry will use machines.
They don't give a shit about people.


177
0:10:30,339 --> 0:10:35,856
They don't care whether they lay
off 400 people, 500 or 3000


178
0:10:35,856 --> 0:10:38,438
if they make more
money doing it.


179
0:10:38,438 --> 0:10:42,347
The Japanese are presently
working on human faces.


180
0:10:42,347 --> 0:10:44,674
They're not quite good enough.


181
0:10:44,674 --> 0:10:50,177
When you get human faces on
television to sell toothpaste


182
0:10:50,177 --> 0:10:53,426
it works for about
15 cents an hour.


183
0:10:53,426 --> 0:10:59,401
Eventually, instead of having
people selling goods on TV


184
0:10:59,401 --> 0:11:3,401
you'll have a face: sweet
old lady, excellent face


185
0:11:3,401 --> 0:11:7,266
but today, their heads
turn like this.


186
0:11:7,266 --> 0:11:12,27
They don't turn naturally.
When the Japanese finally get there


187
0:11:12,27 --> 0:11:16,909
everybody can be displaced,
including doctors, lawyers.


188
0:11:16,909 --> 0:11:20,778
If you don't understand that,
the more sophisticated


189
0:11:20,778 --> 0:11:24,508
say "Well, a scientist can't
be displaced, he can think."


190
0:11:24,508 --> 0:11:28,588
No, a scientist is given
every word in school


191
0:11:28,588 --> 0:11:32,151
that gravity is a force
that shows itself


192
0:11:32,151 --> 0:11:34,653
by electrical, magnetic
and chemical effect.


193
0:11:34,653 --> 0:11:37,416
Every word that they
use is pumped in.


194
0:11:37,416 --> 0:11:41,385
If you made a computer,
an architectural computer


195
0:11:41,385 --> 0:11:44,801
you can say to it
"I want a home"


196
0:11:44,801 --> 0:11:48,25
and it'll say "What kind of home?
" It has to say that


197
0:11:48,25 --> 0:11:50,475
and you'll say "I'm not sure"


198
0:11:50,475 --> 0:11:52,738
because you're not of
student of architecture.


199
0:11:52,738 --> 0:11:55,835
Different homes will
appear and rotate


200
0:11:55,835 --> 0:11:59,219
and you say finally
"No not, that one!"


201
0:11:59,219 --> 0:12:2,134
Then you'd say to the computer


202
0:12:2,134 --> 0:12:6,59
"I'd like to see the floor plan"
and it understands language.


203
0:12:6,59 --> 0:12:10,613
If you don't understand that, there
are machines that can type the speech


204
0:12:10,613 --> 0:12:14,615
that understand language,
so just like the architect


205
0:12:14,615 --> 0:12:18,14
you say ''I'd like to see the floor
plan," and the roof lifts off


206
0:12:18,14 --> 0:12:21,275
or a blueprint is
presented to you.


207
0:12:21,275 --> 0:12:24,707
You begin to design
integrated systems.


208
0:12:24,707 --> 0:12:28,694
Do you know what that means?
That they take in the whole factor


209
0:12:28,694 --> 0:12:32,458
and instead of selling an
air-conditioner to every home


210
0:12:32,458 --> 0:12:35,828
we pipe air-conditioned
air all around


211
0:12:35,828 --> 0:12:38,619
and you absorb what you want.
You turn it on and off.


212
0:12:38,619 --> 0:12:41,735
That's much cheaper than
selling an air-conditioner


213
0:12:41,735 --> 0:12:44,387
or a lawn mower to 5000 houses.


214
0:12:44,387 --> 0:12:46,835
The lawn mower people
would love to do that


215
0:12:46,835 --> 0:12:49,68
to sell a lawn mower
to each house.


216
0:12:49,68 --> 0:12:52,82
Instead of that you have
4 or 5 giant lawn mowers


217
0:12:52,82 --> 0:12:56,66
that take care of the whole area.
Do you understand that?


218
0:12:56,66 --> 0:12:58,805
They say "Do we have
enough resources?"


219
0:12:58,805 --> 0:13:1,922
We don't, using it the
way it's used today:


220
0:13:1,922 --> 0:13:6,74
a lawn mower, an air-conditioner
hanging out of every window.


221
0:13:6,74 --> 0:13:8,874
That's not a way to do things.


222
0:13:8,874 --> 0:13:12,766
You have a thousand farms
growing the same thing.


223
0:13:12,766 --> 0:13:16,685
You have farms, large
farms, industrial farms


224
0:13:16,685 --> 0:13:21,95
without genetic engineering, unless
it's been tested for many years


225
0:13:21,95 --> 0:13:25,966
to make sure there's
no negative effects.


226
0:13:25,966 --> 0:13:31,325
The system I'm talking about
doesn't profit anyone to lie.


227
0:13:31,325 --> 0:13:35,522
Everybody has access to books,
school, free of charge


228
0:13:35,522 --> 0:13:39,202
and there's no taxation.
If you don't like that system


229
0:13:39,202 --> 0:13:42,743
"What are you, an atheist?"


230
0:13:42,743 --> 0:13:45,559
You approach religious
people that way


231
0:13:45,559 --> 0:13:50,386
"This is what God wants.
It's called the brotherhood of man."


232
0:13:50,386 --> 0:13:53,598
This doesn't differ from
any religious teaching.


233
0:13:53,598 --> 0:13:57,838
It really doesn't, so if
you're with normal people


234
0:13:57,838 --> 0:14:1,685
if they say "Will you come
to the Presbytarian church


235
0:14:1,685 --> 0:14:5,678
and give a presentation?
" do it in that guise.


236
0:14:5,678 --> 0:14:9,551
If you go to a bunch of
humanists that are atheists


237
0:14:9,551 --> 0:14:12,225
you don't need to use religion.


238
0:14:12,225 --> 0:14:16,488
You can just point out
the shortcomings.


239
0:14:16,488 --> 0:14:19,316
I think I told you about
the girl that came with me


240
0:14:19,316 --> 0:14:21,961
with a whip and
handcuffs and she says


241
0:14:21,961 --> 0:14:24,865
"I'd like to be whipped and
handcuffed to the bed."


242
0:14:24,865 --> 0:14:28,319
She was a Catholic and
couldn't think of having sex


243
0:14:28,319 --> 0:14:32,721
without force, and
it's not her fault.


244
0:14:32,721 --> 0:14:37,358
She always dreamt of guys holding
her down and making love to her


245
0:14:37,358 --> 0:14:39,995
and that was legitimate to her.


246
0:14:39,995 --> 0:14:44,865
Whenever she thought of 'gee',
having sex, that was sinful.


247
0:14:44,865 --> 0:14:48,322
Is she bad? No.
Is she wrong? No.


248
0:14:48,322 --> 0:14:50,966
She was brought up under
different circumstances.


249
0:14:50,966 --> 0:14:53,506
It takes a long while
to learn that.


250
0:14:53,506 --> 0:14:57,11
It's much easier to
get mad at people.


251
0:14:57,11 --> 0:15:0,523
When you get mad at them,
you feel relieved.


252
0:15:0,523 --> 0:15:4,643
In the future when you understand
that's where they're coming from


253
0:15:4,643 --> 0:17:4,643
you don't get mad.
