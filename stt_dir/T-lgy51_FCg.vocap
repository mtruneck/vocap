###0 f_b_i_ today says alright well we've got a couple suspects we don't know their
###4 names that although now c_b_s_ news reporting
###7 they might be close to getting their names with the maybe perhaps to have
###9 their names but i'm not release them
###11 uh... we don't know about that 'cause this is happening right now but we do
###14 know what they look like
###16 because they have got video and it got pictures of two suspects
###20 lissa here from f_b_i_ today where listing the public's help to identify
###23 the two suspects
###25 after very detailed analysis of photo video and other evidence
###29 we are releasing photos of these two suspects
###33 they are identified a suspect one and suspects who
###36 they appear to be associated
###39 suspect one is wearing a dark at
###42 suspects who was wearing a white house
###44 suspects who sat down a backpack at the site of the second explosion
###49 just in front of the forum restaurant
###53 terial
###54 immediately everybody's learned of those pictures going
###57 are the middle eastern
###59 or are they white
###61 i'd look at adam all day long and
###64 suspect there were two of the white hat
###66 use that kind of a scruffy look there
###68 in the beginning one of the shots of the way he had a mustache
###71 plays at a middle eastern mustache or is that a west virginia mustache
###75 i don't know
###76 for now
###77 that suspect number one with a black at at least is smart enough to put the had
###82 on forwarded supposed cover-up a space
###85 and what is harder to see him
###86 uh... summer saying he looks darker i can understand why they're saying that i
###89 don't know if it's a stigma cap
###91 or fears darker this idiot has done with the baseball cap on backwards
###95 thereby giving the whole point because we did see his face a lot better
###99 it's not covering his face
###101 so
###102 those aren't you guys and everybody in the country now look at those pictures
###106 over and over
###107 obviously if you're in the boston area wondering if you know them to spot them
###111 to figure out who they are
###113 uh... on that note let me just say
###115 whatever you do not do the joy the justice
###118 based on these pictures you are not going to have any certainty whatsoever
###123 you should call that the i wanna eight hundred call f_b_i_
###126 if you think you've got a lead on 'em absolutely don't take action on your own
###130 this is no way you could be absolutely sure base on those pictures they can do
###134 further investigations and figure out if really at those guys are really it or
###138 not right
###139 now yesterday on the show i told you
###140 i was on her all those radio show as south because then
###143 that's what he said he was
###145 and so we're looking for these guys and they cops bettered
###148 uh... they better hope the cops get in before we do
###152 you don't know who got the right guy don't they go on your own hands now
###155 at going back to the race issue come up
###160 i think hop suspect number two at the white house looks white
###164 that's what everybody's saying that
###165 the other guy looks darker
###168 uh...
###169 can you tell
###170 jr hasten his thoughts
###174 that's exactly what it looks like he looks like the person suspect as glasses
###179 you've gone on here
###180 that several of them in person
###184 c and that is that this year is is that the act he created he looks like he did
###188 poorly be white
###190 and could it be a lighter shade of
###192 middle-eastern
###193 i want to go
###194 these are things you can win uh... law enforcement gets too
###198 is that
###200 our look at this hour they must have something then we
###203 also you find my like this
###206 yet but you know the is
###208 uh... my guess they don't have a better than this otherwise it was sherry cuz
###211 they work
###212 if you're sharing the pictures that means we don't
###215 have them
###216 and we need your help
###217 now to are certainly not look like much but if you knew of the guys
###221 then you might see him women did that looks like bob
###225 and that's what helps the thorniest but then you got a report it to them so now
###229 the reason why race is relevant here of course
###232 look it's gonna be a much different reaction in the country keep it real if
###236 it's white words middle east davis rotor orton article that was
###239 very controversial early in the week talking about you know he's rooting for
###243 them to be white
###244 now as we got the pictures
###247 i realize why he was right
###249 weakest as i was out of the bridges honestly i was rooting for them to be
###252 white
###254 because look at their white people aren't going to go on random violent
###258 attacks basis there are typing white people
###261 suffocated alike all dude is a white guy let's attack a
###264 that's not gonna happen in this country because a majority the treasury's white
###267 uh... any people get it you'd r_b_c_ can't make that assumption distrust
###271 because the boss unabomber was white
###274 you should attack brenda white people on force after nine eleven a lot of people
###279 may decide chin sister taggers are muslim there we should attack random
###283 muslim people now is that assumption baeza of course i just loved i was
###287 assuming never a white guys a bomber if these guys turn out to be white
###291 or let's eternity right wingers can you make the assumption
###294 leisure tag every right warehouse if it is that
###297 r_t_c_ can do that
###298 these are extremists no matter what their politics says
###302 and a lot of other ideology or nationality or races
###305 but unfortunately becomes a muslims in this country people do make assumptions
###309 of undoubtedly the wrong as substance after nine eleven and it's so continues
###313 to this day a lot of sikhs were attacked it was a bitter but also they get its
###318 act position in the sikh temple
###321 people are still that dumb this late in the process
###325 i couldn't help us say hey you know what man
###328 i hope they are not middle eastern 'cause we know what happens when their
###331 middle eastern and it has been pretty
###333 whereas the people are not going to make a research hopes about why people in
###337 this country so that's part of the reasoning behind it not being honest
###340 about it now do i know who they are of course i don't i i don't know if they're
###343 white and middle eastern
###345 whether nationality or what their ideology is
###347 but i sure hope the parties get 'em
###349 uh... because
###351 i'm also worried that it's been a couple of days now if they planned this well
###355 and they planted well ahead of time
###357 they obviously
###358 should i have an escape route
###359 and we didn't get them in a couple of days and if they were foreigners
###363 it even if they're not borders they could be long gone
###367 god knows where they are
###368 it we have a name we might be able to track them down better
###372 out but i was there incredibly series entirely possible
###375 they wouldn't be
###376 anywhere near the boston area now
###380 another hand we've seen time and time again
###382 wears a guy you're looking for
###384 right next to you
###385 eleven with christopher dorfner and have been all the way back with a with
###388 interpret an end
###389 that he killed reciting in miami no i don't like i was using it as well as a
###394 target self
###395 now internet is a couple months down the street in miami
###399 we don't know yet
###401 but with a whole country's hoping we find him
###403 no matter what their ideology or their racists
