1
0:1:2,3 --> 0:1:6,64
Christmas comes but once a year


2
0:1:6,64 --> 0:1:10,976
For every girl and boy


3
0:1:10,976 --> 0:1:15,315
The laughter and the joy


4
0:1:15,315 --> 0:1:19,82
They find in each new toy


5
0:1:19,82 --> 0:1:24,323
I'll tell you of a little boy


6
0:1:24,323 --> 0:1:28,83
Who lives across the way


7
0:1:28,83 --> 0:1:33,25
This little fella's Christmas


8
0:1:33,25 --> 0:3:8,21
Is just another day


9
0:3:8,21 --> 0:3:11,148
It was just before dawn


10
0:3:11,148 --> 0:3:13,86
One miserable morning


11
0:3:13,86 --> 0:3:17,989
In black '44


12
0:3:17,989 --> 0:3:23,577
When the forward commander
was told to sit tight


13
0:3:23,577 --> 0:3:30,671
When he asked that
his men be withdrawn


14
0:3:30,671 --> 0:3:33,548
And the generals gave thanks


15
0:3:33,548 --> 0:3:35,552
As the other ranks


16
0:3:35,552 --> 0:3:39,54
Held back the enemy tanks


17
0:3:39,54 --> 0:3:41,55
For a while


18
0:3:41,55 --> 0:3:43,682
And the Anzio bridgehead


19
0:3:43,682 --> 0:3:46,27
Was held for the price


20
0:3:46,27 --> 0:4:15,594
Of a few hundred ordinary lives


21
0:4:15,594 --> 0:4:18,182
He's the little boy


22
0:4:18,182 --> 0:4:25,189
That Santa Claus forgot


23
0:4:25,189 --> 0:4:27,523
And Goodness knows


24
0:4:27,523 --> 0:4:34,364
He didn't want a lot


25
0:4:34,364 --> 0:4:38,2
He sent a note to Santa


26
0:4:38,2 --> 0:4:43,207
For some soldiers and a drum


27
0:4:43,207 --> 0:4:46,836
It broke his little heart


28
0:4:46,836 --> 0:4:52,218
When he found Santa hadn't come


29
0:4:52,218 --> 0:4:54,804
In the street he envies


30
0:4:54,804 --> 0:7:27,717
All those lucky boys


31
0:7:27,717 --> 0:7:30,138
So ya thought ya


32
0:7:30,138 --> 0:7:32,141
Might like to


33
0:7:32,141 --> 0:7:37,48
Go to the show


34
0:7:37,48 --> 0:7:41,485
To feel the warm thrill
of confusion


35
0:7:41,485 --> 0:7:46,322
That space cadet glow


36
0:7:46,322 --> 0:7:51,244
Tell me, is something
eluding you, sunshine


37
0:7:51,244 --> 0:7:55,666
Is this not what
you expected to see


38
0:7:55,666 --> 0:8:0,505
If you wanna find out
what's behind these cold eyes


39
0:8:0,505 --> 0:10:33,3
You'll just have to
claw your way through this disguise


40
0:10:33,3 --> 0:10:38,718
Mama loves her baby


41
0:10:38,718 --> 0:10:43,516
And Daddy loves you too


42
0:10:43,516 --> 0:10:49,272
And the sea may look
warm to you, babe


43
0:10:49,272 --> 0:10:53,984
And the sky may look blue


44
0:10:53,984 --> 0:10:58,115
Ooh, ooh, ooh


45
0:10:58,115 --> 0:11:4,705
Ooh, babe


46
0:11:4,705 --> 0:11:8,837
Ooh, ooh, ooh


47
0:11:8,837 --> 0:11:15,675
Baby blue


48
0:11:15,675 --> 0:11:21,57
Ooh, ooh, ooh


49
0:11:21,57 --> 0:11:27,855
Ooh, ooh, babe


50
0:11:27,855 --> 0:11:31,651
If you should go skating


51
0:11:31,651 --> 0:11:37,575
On the thin ice of modern life


52
0:11:37,575 --> 0:11:40,76
Dragging behind you


53
0:11:40,76 --> 0:11:42,581
The silent reproach


54
0:11:42,581 --> 0:11:48,462
Of a million tear-stained eyes


55
0:11:48,462 --> 0:11:50,547
Don't be surprised


56
0:11:50,547 --> 0:11:53,8
When a crack in the ice


57
0:11:53,8 --> 0:11:58,765
Appears under your feet


58
0:11:58,765 --> 0:12:4,313
You slip out of your depth
and out of your mind


59
0:12:4,313 --> 0:12:8,231
With you fear
flowing out behind you


60
0:12:8,231 --> 0:13:9,715
As you claw the thin ice


61
0:13:9,715 --> 0:13:19,52
Daddy's flown across the ocean


62
0:13:19,52 --> 0:13:28,946
Leaving just a memory


63
0:13:28,946 --> 0:13:39,39
A snapshot in the family album


64
0:13:39,39 --> 0:13:51,221
Daddy, what else
did you leave for me


65
0:13:51,221 --> 0:13:59,103
Daddy, what'd ya leave behind for me


66
0:13:59,103 --> 0:14:1,397
All in all it was


67
0:14:1,397 --> 0:14:8,949
Just a brick in the wall


68
0:14:8,949 --> 0:14:36,937
All in all it was all
just bricks in the wall


69
0:14:36,937 --> 0:14:49,992
Easy. Be careful.


70
0:14:49,992 --> 0:14:52,204
- What?
- Will you put me on there?


71
0:14:52,204 --> 0:14:55,247
- Well, where's your mother, then?
- She's gone to the shops.


72
0:14:55,247 --> 0:14:59,335
Yes, all right.


73
0:14:59,335 --> 0:15:8,18
How's that then? Enjoying it?


74
0:15:8,18 --> 0:15:19,984
Lovely, lovely.


75
0:15:19,984 --> 0:15:25,156
Now off you go.
Go on.


76
0:15:25,156 --> 0:15:27,325
Now what have I told you about this?
What have I told you?


77
0:15:27,325 --> 0:17:32,461
Go on, go on now. Sling your hook.
Go on. Sling your hook.


78
0:17:32,461 --> 0:17:34,964
And kind old King George


79
0:17:34,964 --> 0:17:37,884
Sent Mother a note


80
0:17:37,884 --> 0:17:43,471
When he heard that Father was gone


81
0:17:43,471 --> 0:17:46,1
It was, I recall


82
0:17:46,1 --> 0:17:49,229
In the form of a scroll


83
0:17:49,229 --> 0:17:54,36
Gold leaf and all


84
0:17:54,36 --> 0:17:57,405
And I found it one day


85
0:17:57,405 --> 0:18:0,782
In a drawer of old photographs


86
0:18:0,782 --> 0:18:4,787
Hidden away


87
0:18:4,787 --> 0:18:8,834
And my eyes still grow damp
to remember


88
0:18:8,834 --> 0:18:11,753
His Majesty signed


89
0:18:11,753 --> 0:18:17,218
With his own rubber stamp


90
0:18:17,218 --> 0:18:19,929
It was dark all around


91
0:18:19,929 --> 0:18:22,515
There was frost in the ground


92
0:18:22,515 --> 0:18:28,73
When the tigers broke free


93
0:18:28,73 --> 0:18:31,276
And no one survived


94
0:18:31,276 --> 0:18:39,657
From the Royal Fusiliers Company C


95
0:18:39,657 --> 0:18:42,996
They were all left behind


96
0:18:42,996 --> 0:18:45,748
Most of them dead


97
0:18:45,748 --> 0:18:51,339
The rest of them dying


98
0:18:51,339 --> 0:18:54,926
And that's how the high command


99
0:18:54,926 --> 0:19:59,454
Took my daddy from me


100
0:19:59,454 --> 0:20:3,958
Did you see the frightened ones


101
0:20:3,958 --> 0:20:8,297
Did you hear the falling bombs


102
0:20:8,297 --> 0:20:12,967
Did you ever wonder why
we had to run for shelter


103
0:20:12,967 --> 0:20:34,826
When the promise of a brave new world
unfurled beneath the clear blue sky


104
0:20:34,826 --> 0:20:39,81
Did you see the frightened ones


105
0:20:39,81 --> 0:20:43,587
Did you hear the falling bombs


106
0:20:43,587 --> 0:20:52,302
The flames are all long gone
but the pain lingers on


107
0:20:52,302 --> 0:20:54,388
Good-bye


108
0:20:54,388 --> 0:20:56,934
Blue sky


109
0:20:56,934 --> 0:21:0,478
Good-bye, blue sky


110
0:21:0,478 --> 0:21:4,901
Good-bye


111
0:21:4,901 --> 0:21:13,368
Good-bye


112
0:21:13,368 --> 0:21:16,621
Wait for me, Pinky,
you rotten bleeder.


113
0:21:16,621 --> 0:21:19,626
- They're my bullets, ain't they?
- I don't know.


114
0:21:19,626 --> 0:21:23,45
Come on, Tubs.
It's great down in the tunnel.


115
0:21:23,45 --> 0:21:25,505
Don't you think
it'd be dangerous, Pinky?


116
0:21:25,505 --> 0:21:38,98
No. Don't be daft.


117
0:21:38,98 --> 0:21:49,573
- You all right, Tubs?
- Yeah. Hurt me knee a bit.


118
0:21:49,573 --> 0:21:51,326
- Come on.
- Na. It's too dangerous.


119
0:21:51,326 --> 0:22:4,381
- We'll wait for the train.
- Give me the torch.


120
0:22:4,381 --> 0:22:6,968
Pinky! Here comes the train!


121
0:22:6,968 --> 0:22:12,181
Get off the line,
you bloody idiot! Here it comes!


122
0:22:12,181 --> 0:22:16,603
Pinky, get off the line!
Here it comes!


123
0:22:16,603 --> 0:22:36,84
Pinky, get off the line!


124
0:22:36,84 --> 0:22:39,961
You!


125
0:22:39,961 --> 0:22:43,591
You! Yes, you!


126
0:22:43,591 --> 0:23:8,493
Stand still, laddie!


127
0:23:8,493 --> 0:23:11,455
When we grew up and went to school


128
0:23:11,455 --> 0:23:20,422
There were certain teachers who would
hurt the children anyway they could


129
0:23:20,422 --> 0:23:25,11
By pouring their derision
upon anything we did


130
0:23:25,11 --> 0:23:27,347
Exposing every weakness


131
0:23:27,347 --> 0:23:31,144
However carefully hidden
by the kids


132
0:23:31,144 --> 0:23:33,646
What have we here, laddie?


133
0:23:33,646 --> 0:23:38,66
Mysterious scribblings?
A secret code?


134
0:23:38,66 --> 0:23:40,526
No. Poems, no less.


135
0:23:40,526 --> 0:23:42,739
Poems, everybody!


136
0:23:42,739 --> 0:23:46,201
The lad here reckons himself
a poet.


137
0:23:46,201 --> 0:23:49,204
"Money, get back.
I'm all right, Jack.


138
0:23:49,204 --> 0:23:52,5
Keep your hands
off my stack.


139
0:23:52,5 --> 0:23:55,835
New car, caviar,
four-star daydream.


140
0:23:55,835 --> 0:23:59,49
Think I'll buy me
a football team. "


141
0:23:59,49 --> 0:24:1,717
Absolute rubbish, laddie!


142
0:24:1,717 --> 0:24:5,96
Get on with your work.


143
0:24:5,96 --> 0:24:6,807
Repeat after me:


144
0:24:6,807 --> 0:24:10,61
An acre is the area
of a rectangle...


145
0:24:10,61 --> 0:24:12,439
whose length is one furlong...


146
0:24:12,439 --> 0:24:15,231
and whose width is one chain.


147
0:24:15,231 --> 0:24:17,567
But in this town it was well known


148
0:24:17,567 --> 0:24:21,989
When they got home at night
their fat and psychopathic wives


149
0:24:21,989 --> 0:24:43,847
Would thrash them
within inches of their lives


150
0:24:43,847 --> 0:24:53,273
We don't need no education


151
0:24:53,273 --> 0:25:2,201
We don't need no thought control


152
0:25:2,201 --> 0:25:11,5
No dark sarcasm in the classroom


153
0:25:11,5 --> 0:25:22,181
Teacher, leave them kids alone


154
0:25:22,181 --> 0:25:30,814
Hey, teacher, leave them kids alone


155
0:25:30,814 --> 0:25:37,53
All in all it's just
another brick in the wall


156
0:25:37,53 --> 0:25:39,782
Wrong! Do it again!


157
0:25:39,782 --> 0:25:49,0
All in all you're just
another brick in the wall


158
0:25:49,0 --> 0:25:53,339
We don't need no education


159
0:25:53,339 --> 0:25:56,342
If you don't eat your meat,
you can't have any pudding!


160
0:25:56,342 --> 0:25:59,681
We don't need no thought control


161
0:25:59,681 --> 0:26:2,557
How can you have any pudding
if you don't eat your meat?


162
0:26:2,557 --> 0:26:5,852
No dark sarcasm in the classroom


163
0:26:5,852 --> 0:26:8,521
You! Yes, you, laddie!


164
0:26:8,521 --> 0:26:11,858
Poems, everybody.
The lad here reckons himself a poet.


165
0:26:11,858 --> 0:26:22,247
Teachers, leave them kids alone


166
0:26:22,247 --> 0:26:31,88
Hey, teacher, leave those kids alone


167
0:26:31,88 --> 0:26:40,307
All in all you're just
another brick in the wall


168
0:26:40,307 --> 0:27:30,945
All in all you're just
another brick in the wall


169
0:27:30,945 --> 0:27:49,466
We don't need no education


170
0:27:49,466 --> 0:27:58,934
No dark sarcasm in the classroom


171
0:27:58,934 --> 0:28:3,396
Again. An acre is the area
of a rectangle...


172
0:28:3,396 --> 0:28:5,733
whose length is one furlong...


173
0:28:5,733 --> 0:29:1,377
and whose width is one chain.


174
0:29:1,377 --> 0:29:17,31
Mother, do you think
they'll drop the bomb


175
0:29:17,31 --> 0:29:34,162
Mother, do you think
they'll like the song


176
0:29:34,162 --> 0:29:49,178
Mother, do you think
they'll try to break my balls


177
0:29:49,178 --> 0:30:19,378
Mother, should I build the wall


178
0:30:19,378 --> 0:30:35,688
Mother, should I run for president


179
0:30:35,688 --> 0:30:52,581
Mother, should I trust the government


180
0:30:52,581 --> 0:31:7,222
Mother, will they put me
in the firing line


181
0:31:7,222 --> 0:31:16,398
Mother, am I really dying


182
0:31:16,398 --> 0:31:25,158
Hush now, baby, baby
don't you cry


183
0:31:25,158 --> 0:31:30,788
Mama's gonna make all of
your nightmares come true


184
0:31:30,788 --> 0:31:36,47
Mama's gonna put
all of her fears into you


185
0:31:36,47 --> 0:31:41,342
Mama's gonna keep you
right here under her wing


186
0:31:41,342 --> 0:31:46,64
She won't let you fly
but she might let you sing


187
0:31:46,64 --> 0:31:56,236
Mama's gonna keep baby cozy and warm


188
0:31:56,236 --> 0:32:2,991
Ooooh, babe


189
0:32:2,991 --> 0:32:7,788
Ooooh, babe


190
0:32:7,788 --> 0:32:47,248
Ooh, babe, of course
Mama's gonna help build the wall


191
0:32:47,248 --> 0:32:58,259
Hello. Hello.
Is there anybody in there?


192
0:32:58,259 --> 0:32:59,97
Do you remember me?


193
0:32:59,97 --> 0:33:13,319
I'm the one
from the Registry Office.


194
0:33:13,319 --> 0:33:22,369
Mother, do you think
she's good enough


195
0:33:22,369 --> 0:33:29,501
For me


196
0:33:29,501 --> 0:33:38,803
And, Mother
do you think she's dangerous


197
0:33:38,803 --> 0:33:45,853
To me


198
0:33:45,853 --> 0:33:56,78
Mother, will she tear
your little boy apart


199
0:33:56,78 --> 0:34:1,204
Ooooh, Ma


200
0:34:1,204 --> 0:34:10,295
Mother, will she break my heart


201
0:34:10,295 --> 0:34:19,13
Hush now, baby, baby
don't you cry


202
0:34:19,13 --> 0:34:24,311
Mama's gonna check out
all your girlfriends for you


203
0:34:24,311 --> 0:34:29,65
Mama won't let anyone
dirty get through


204
0:34:29,65 --> 0:34:34,906
Mama's gonna wait up
until you get in


205
0:34:34,906 --> 0:34:40,162
Mama will always find out
where you've been


206
0:34:40,162 --> 0:34:49,672
Mama's gonna keep baby
healthy and clean


207
0:34:49,672 --> 0:34:56,388
Oooh, babe


208
0:34:56,388 --> 0:35:1,393
Oooh, babe


209
0:35:1,393 --> 0:35:19,915
Ooh, babe
You'll always be baby to me


210
0:35:19,915 --> 0:35:47,653
Mother, did it need to be so high


211
0:35:47,653 --> 0:35:49,32
- Hello?
- Yes, a collect call...


212
0:35:49,32 --> 0:35:51,615
for Mrs. Floyd from Mr. Floyd.


213
0:35:51,615 --> 0:36:0,124
Will you accept the charge
from the United States?


214
0:36:0,124 --> 0:36:2,543
I wonder why he hung up. Is there
supposed to be someone else there...


215
0:36:2,543 --> 0:36:8,341
besides your wife, sir,
to answer?


216
0:36:8,341 --> 0:36:10,802
- Hello?
- This is United States calling.


217
0:36:10,802 --> 0:36:15,35
Are we reaching-


218
0:36:15,35 --> 0:38:2,341
See, he keeps hanging up,
and it's a man answering.


219
0:38:2,341 --> 0:38:6,846
What shall we use


220
0:38:6,846 --> 0:38:9,431
To fill


221
0:38:9,431 --> 0:38:14,394
The empty spaces


222
0:38:14,394 --> 0:38:16,897
Where waves


223
0:38:16,897 --> 0:38:19,567
Of hunger


224
0:38:19,567 --> 0:38:22,363
Roar


225
0:38:22,363 --> 0:38:26,285
Shall we set out across


226
0:38:26,285 --> 0:38:28,996
This sea


227
0:38:28,996 --> 0:38:32,289
Of faces


228
0:38:32,289 --> 0:38:36,376
In search of more


229
0:38:36,376 --> 0:38:59,737
And more applause


230
0:38:59,737 --> 0:39:4,408
Shall we buy a new guitar


231
0:39:4,408 --> 0:39:8,996
Shall we drive
a more powerful car


232
0:39:8,996 --> 0:39:13,709
Shall we work
straight through the night


233
0:39:13,709 --> 0:39:15,92
Shall we get into fights


234
0:39:15,92 --> 0:39:18,591
Leave the lights on
Drop bombs


235
0:39:18,591 --> 0:39:23,13
Do tours of the East
Contract diseases


236
0:39:23,13 --> 0:39:25,39
Bury bones
Break up homes


237
0:39:25,39 --> 0:39:27,724
Send flowers by phone


238
0:39:27,724 --> 0:39:30,61
Take to drink
Go to shrinks


239
0:39:30,61 --> 0:39:32,354
Give up meat
Rarely sleep


240
0:39:32,354 --> 0:39:34,607
Keep people as pets


241
0:39:34,607 --> 0:39:36,986
Train dogs
Race rats


242
0:39:36,986 --> 0:39:39,278
Fill the attic with cash


243
0:39:39,278 --> 0:39:41,281
Bury treasure
Store up leisure


244
0:39:41,281 --> 0:39:47,287
But never relax at all


245
0:39:47,287 --> 0:40:24,995
With our backs to the wall


246
0:40:24,995 --> 0:40:30,42
I am just a new boy


247
0:40:30,42 --> 0:40:35,47
A stranger in this town


248
0:40:35,47 --> 0:40:40,96
Where are all the good times


249
0:40:40,96 --> 0:40:55,28
Who's gonna show this stranger around


250
0:40:55,28 --> 0:40:59,284
Ooooh


251
0:40:59,284 --> 0:41:5,456
I need a dirty woman


252
0:41:5,456 --> 0:41:9,46
Ooooh


253
0:41:9,46 --> 0:41:15,635
I need a dirty girl


254
0:41:15,635 --> 0:41:20,68
Will some woman in this desert land


255
0:41:20,68 --> 0:41:25,6
Make me feel like a real man


256
0:41:25,6 --> 0:41:30,525
Take this rock and roll refugee


257
0:41:30,525 --> 0:41:45,959
Ooh, babe, set me free


258
0:41:45,959 --> 0:41:49,838
Ooooh


259
0:41:49,838 --> 0:41:56,54
I need a dirty woman


260
0:41:56,54 --> 0:42:0,14
Ooooh


261
0:42:0,14 --> 0:42:51,656
I need a dirty girl


262
0:42:51,656 --> 0:42:55,658
Ooooh


263
0:42:55,658 --> 0:43:1,707
I need a dirty woman


264
0:43:1,707 --> 0:43:5,755
Ooooh


265
0:43:5,755 --> 0:43:39,29
I need a dirty girl


266
0:43:39,29 --> 0:43:42,461
Oh, my God.


267
0:43:42,461 --> 0:43:48,841
What a fabulous room.


268
0:43:48,841 --> 0:44:5,194
- Are all these your guitars?


269
0:44:5,194 --> 0:44:7,239
- God.


270
0:44:7,239 --> 0:44:23,547
This place is bigger
than our whole apartment.


271
0:44:23,547 --> 0:44:28,927
- You like the tube, huh?


272
0:44:28,927 --> 0:44:35,143
Can I get a drink of water?


273
0:44:35,143 --> 0:44:54,539
- Can I get you a drink of water?


274
0:44:54,539 --> 0:44:58,169
- Oh, wow, look at this tub!


275
0:44:58,169 --> 0:45:11,98
Wanna take a bath?


276
0:45:11,98 --> 0:45:20,734
- What are you watching?


277
0:45:20,734 --> 0:45:30,411
- Hello? Hello?


278
0:45:30,411 --> 0:45:32,622
- You feeling okay?


279
0:45:32,622 --> 0:45:36,417
Day after day


280
0:45:36,417 --> 0:45:39,214
Love turns grey


281
0:45:39,214 --> 0:45:46,345
Like the skin of a dying man


282
0:45:46,345 --> 0:45:49,266
And night after night


283
0:45:49,266 --> 0:45:52,936
We pretend it's all right


284
0:45:52,936 --> 0:45:56,4
But I have grown older


285
0:45:56,4 --> 0:45:59,733
And you have grown colder


286
0:45:59,733 --> 0:46:6,409
And nothing is very much fun anymore


287
0:46:6,409 --> 0:46:13,82
And I can feel


288
0:46:13,82 --> 0:46:19,798
One of my turns coming on


289
0:46:19,798 --> 0:46:22,968
I


290
0:46:22,968 --> 0:46:26,306
Feel


291
0:46:26,306 --> 0:46:29,685
Cold as a razor blade


292
0:46:29,685 --> 0:46:33,62
Tight as a tourniquet


293
0:46:33,62 --> 0:46:41,447
Dry as a funeral drum


294
0:46:41,447 --> 0:46:43,448
Run to the bedroom


295
0:46:43,448 --> 0:46:52,252
In the suitcase on the left
you'll find my favorite axe


296
0:46:52,252 --> 0:46:56,754
Don't look so frightened
This is just a passing phase


297
0:46:56,754 --> 0:47:2,511
One of my bad days


298
0:47:2,511 --> 0:47:5,806
Would you like to watch TV


299
0:47:5,806 --> 0:47:11,438
Or get between the sheets
Or contemplate the silent freeway


300
0:47:11,438 --> 0:47:14,106
Would you like something to eat


301
0:47:14,106 --> 0:47:18,487
Would you like to learn to fly


302
0:47:18,487 --> 0:47:57,654
Would ya
Would you like to see me try


303
0:47:57,654 --> 0:48:0,408
Would you like to call the cops


304
0:48:0,408 --> 0:48:4,78
- Do you think it's time I stopped
- Next time, fuckers!


305
0:48:4,78 --> 0:49:8,94
Why are you running away


306
0:49:8,94 --> 0:49:14,821
Oooh, babe


307
0:49:14,821 --> 0:49:26,501
Don't leave me now


308
0:49:26,501 --> 0:49:39,141
How could you go


309
0:49:39,141 --> 0:49:51,152
When you know how I need you


310
0:49:51,152 --> 0:49:56,325
To beat to a pulp
on a Saturday night


311
0:49:56,325 --> 0:50:1,708
Oh, babe


312
0:50:1,708 --> 0:50:17,641
Don't leave me now


313
0:50:17,641 --> 0:50:24,939
How can you treat me this way


314
0:50:24,939 --> 0:50:33,7
Running away


315
0:50:33,7 --> 0:50:39,663
Ooh, babe


316
0:50:39,663 --> 0:50:43,959
Why are you running away


317
0:50:43,959 --> 0:50:55,598
Oooh, babe


318
0:50:55,598 --> 0:51:35,766
Oooh, babe


319
0:51:35,766 --> 0:51:44,235
I don't need no arms around me


320
0:51:44,235 --> 0:51:53,161
And I don't need
no drugs to calm me


321
0:51:53,161 --> 0:52:1,545
I have seen the writing on the wall


322
0:52:1,545 --> 0:52:10,346
Don't think I need anything at all


323
0:52:10,346 --> 0:52:12,723
No


324
0:52:12,723 --> 0:52:23,945
Don't think I need anything at all


325
0:52:23,945 --> 0:52:31,952
All and all it was all
just bricks in the wall


326
0:52:31,952 --> 0:53:7,284
All and all you were all
just bricks in the wall


327
0:53:7,284 --> 0:53:11,662
Good-bye, cruel world


328
0:53:11,662 --> 0:53:16,292
I'm leaving you today


329
0:53:16,292 --> 0:53:20,924
Good-bye, good-bye


330
0:53:20,924 --> 0:53:30,935
Good-bye


331
0:53:30,935 --> 0:53:35,355
Good-bye, all you people


332
0:53:35,355 --> 0:53:39,443
There's nothing you can say


333
0:53:39,443 --> 0:53:44,616
To make me change my mind


334
0:53:44,616 --> 0:54:13,814
Good-bye


335
0:54:13,814 --> 0:54:26,536
Is there anybody out there


336
0:54:26,536 --> 0:54:37,883
Is there anybody out there


337
0:54:37,883 --> 0:54:52,314
Is there anybody out there


338
0:54:52,314 --> 0:57:57,307
Is there anybody out there


339
0:57:57,307 --> 0:58:2,22
I've got a little black book
with my poems in


340
0:58:2,22 --> 0:58:6,651
Got a bag with a toothbrush
and a comb in


341
0:58:6,651 --> 0:58:15,118
When I'm a good dog
they sometimes throw me a bone in


342
0:58:15,118 --> 0:58:19,706
I got elastic bands
keeping my shoes on


343
0:58:19,706 --> 0:58:24,212
Got those swollen-hand blues


344
0:58:24,212 --> 0:58:33,138
I've got 13 channels of shit
on the TV to choose from


345
0:58:33,138 --> 0:58:39,604
I've got electric light


346
0:58:39,604 --> 0:58:42,357
And I've got second sight


347
0:58:42,357 --> 0:58:53,284
I've got amazing powers
of observation


348
0:58:53,284 --> 0:58:56,997
And that is how I know


349
0:58:56,997 --> 0:59:1,961
When I try to get through


350
0:59:1,961 --> 0:59:8,466
On the telephone to you


351
0:59:8,466 --> 0:59:18,604
- There'll be nobody home


352
0:59:18,604 --> 0:59:23,401
- I got the obligatory Hendrix perm


353
0:59:23,401 --> 0:59:28,49
And the inevitable pinhole burns


354
0:59:28,49 --> 0:59:36,624
All down the front
of my favorite satin shirt


355
0:59:36,624 --> 0:59:41,545
I've got nicotine stains
on my fingers


356
0:59:41,545 --> 0:59:46,342
I've got a silver spoon on a chain


357
0:59:46,342 --> 0:59:54,811
Got a grand piano
to prop up my mortal remains


358
0:59:54,811 --> 1:0:0,523
I got wild staring eyes


359
1:0:0,523 --> 1:0:6,697
And I got a strong urge to fly


360
1:0:6,697 --> 1:0:18,376
But I got nowhere to fly to


361
1:0:18,376 --> 1:0:23,425
Oooh, babe


362
1:0:23,425 --> 1:0:30,58
When I pick up the phone


363
1:0:30,58 --> 1:0:40,233
There's still nobody home


364
1:0:40,233 --> 1:0:44,906
I've got a pair of Gohills boots


365
1:0:44,906 --> 1:3:16,238
And I got fading roots


366
1:3:16,238 --> 1:3:27,81
Does anybody here
remember Vera Lynn


367
1:3:27,81 --> 1:3:29,876
Remember how she said


368
1:3:29,876 --> 1:3:33,548
That we would meet again


369
1:3:33,548 --> 1:4:1,246
Some sunny day


370
1:4:1,246 --> 1:4:8,42
Vera


371
1:4:8,42 --> 1:4:16,553
What has become of you


372
1:4:16,553 --> 1:4:20,309
Does anybody else in here


373
1:4:20,309 --> 1:4:43,873
Feel the way I do


374
1:4:43,873 --> 1:4:52,843
Bring the boys back home


375
1:4:52,843 --> 1:5:1,519
Bring the boys back home


376
1:5:1,519 --> 1:5:4,69
Don't leave the children


377
1:5:4,69 --> 1:5:13,49
On their own, no, no


378
1:5:13,49 --> 1:5:22,874
Bring the boys back home


379
1:5:22,874 --> 1:5:31,97
Bring the boys back home


380
1:5:31,97 --> 1:5:35,387
Don't leave the children


381
1:5:35,387 --> 1:5:43,732
On their own, no, no


382
1:5:43,732 --> 1:5:50,614
Bring the boys back home


383
1:5:50,614 --> 1:6:2,96
- Bad! Do it again!


384
1:6:2,96 --> 1:6:13,929
- You feeling okay?


385
1:6:13,929 --> 1:6:17,434
Is there anybody out there


386
1:6:17,434 --> 1:6:19,728
- Fuck me.


387
1:6:19,728 --> 1:6:23,25
He's gone completely around
the bleedin' twist.


388
1:6:23,25 --> 1:6:27,322
You vicious bastard,
you never did like me, did you?


389
1:6:27,322 --> 1:6:29,616
Hello


390
1:6:29,616 --> 1:6:33,701
Is there anybody in there


391
1:6:33,701 --> 1:6:38,248
Just nod if you can hear me


392
1:6:38,248 --> 1:6:42,462
Is there anyone at home


393
1:6:42,462 --> 1:6:45,758
Come on, now


394
1:6:45,758 --> 1:6:50,52
I hear you're feeling down


395
1:6:50,52 --> 1:6:52,931
Well, I can ease your pain


396
1:6:52,931 --> 1:6:57,52
- And get you on your feet again
- The boy's an asthmatic.


397
1:6:57,52 --> 1:7:0,565
- Asthmatic!?
- Relax


398
1:7:0,565 --> 1:7:5,153
- I'll need some information first
- He's an artist!


399
1:7:5,153 --> 1:7:8,531
Just the basic facts


400
1:7:8,531 --> 1:7:12,911
Can you show me where it hurts


401
1:7:12,911 --> 1:7:20,879
There is no pain
you are receding


402
1:7:20,879 --> 1:7:28,345
A distant ship smoke
on the horizon


403
1:7:28,345 --> 1:7:35,353
You are only coming through in waves


404
1:7:35,353 --> 1:7:37,355
Your lips move


405
1:7:37,355 --> 1:7:43,28
But I can't hear what you're saying


406
1:7:43,28 --> 1:7:45,988
When I was a child


407
1:7:45,988 --> 1:7:50,536
I had a fever


408
1:7:50,536 --> 1:7:58,42
My hands felt just like two balloons


409
1:7:58,42 --> 1:8:3,92
Now I've got that feeling once again


410
1:8:3,92 --> 1:8:7,303
I can't explain
you would not understand


411
1:8:7,303 --> 1:8:13,644
This is not how I am


412
1:8:13,644 --> 1:8:18,359
I


413
1:8:18,359 --> 1:8:55,274
Have become comfortably numb


414
1:8:55,274 --> 1:9:0,322
I


415
1:9:0,322 --> 1:9:6,868
Have become comfortably numb


416
1:9:6,868 --> 1:9:9,454
Okay


417
1:9:9,454 --> 1:9:13,292
Just a little pinprick


418
1:9:13,292 --> 1:9:17,298
There'll be no more
Aaaaah


419
1:9:17,298 --> 1:9:21,301
But you may feel a little sick


420
1:9:21,301 --> 1:9:24,637
Can you stand up


421
1:9:24,637 --> 1:9:27,141
I do believe it's working


422
1:9:27,141 --> 1:9:28,435
- Good
- He's coming around.


423
1:9:28,435 --> 1:9:33,44
- That'll keep you going through the show
- There, you see?


424
1:9:33,44 --> 1:9:37,111
- Come on, it's time to go
- How do you feel?


425
1:9:37,111 --> 1:9:45,77
There is no pain
you are receding


426
1:9:45,77 --> 1:9:52,419
A distant ship smoke
on the horizon


427
1:9:52,419 --> 1:9:59,508
You are only coming through in waves


428
1:9:59,508 --> 1:10:1,51
Your lips move


429
1:10:1,51 --> 1:10:7,102
But I can't hear what you're saying


430
1:10:7,102 --> 1:10:10,146
When I was a child


431
1:10:10,146 --> 1:10:15,4
I caught a fleeting glimpse


432
1:10:15,4 --> 1:10:22,785
Out of the corner of my eye


433
1:10:22,785 --> 1:10:26,872
I turned to look
but it was gone


434
1:10:26,872 --> 1:10:31,669
I cannot put my finger on it now


435
1:10:31,669 --> 1:10:37,717
The child is grown
The dream is gone


436
1:10:37,717 --> 1:10:42,431
I


437
1:10:42,431 --> 1:14:24,256
Have become comfortably numb


438
1:14:24,256 --> 1:14:27,343
So ya thought ya


439
1:14:27,343 --> 1:14:33,933
Might like to go to the show


440
1:14:33,933 --> 1:14:37,685
To feel the warm thrill
of confusion


441
1:14:37,685 --> 1:14:43,777
That space cadet glow


442
1:14:43,777 --> 1:14:48,2
I got some bad news for you, sunshine


443
1:14:48,2 --> 1:14:52,33
Pink isn't well
He's, uh, back at the hotel


444
1:14:52,33 --> 1:14:55,455
And they sent us along
as a surrogate band


445
1:14:55,455 --> 1:15:3,9
Now tonight, we 're gonna find out
where you fans really stand


446
1:15:3,9 --> 1:15:7,803
Are there any queers
in the audience tonight


447
1:15:7,803 --> 1:15:12,183
- Get 'em up against the wall
- Against the wall


448
1:15:12,183 --> 1:15:17,604
There's one in the spotlight
he don't look right


449
1:15:17,604 --> 1:15:22,193
- Have him up against the wall
- Against the wall


450
1:15:22,193 --> 1:15:26,658
And that one looks Jewish
And that one's a coon


451
1:15:26,658 --> 1:15:30,287
Who let all this riffraff
into the room


452
1:15:30,287 --> 1:15:32,538
There's one smoking a joint


453
1:15:32,538 --> 1:15:36,751
And that one's got spots


454
1:15:36,751 --> 1:17:12,63
If I had my way
I'd have all of you shot


455
1:17:12,63 --> 1:17:27,955
Run, run, run, run


456
1:17:27,955 --> 1:17:32,84
You better make your face up
in your favorite disguise


457
1:17:32,84 --> 1:17:36,632
With your button-down lips
and your roller-blind eyes


458
1:17:36,632 --> 1:17:40,762
With your empty smile
and your hungry heart


459
1:17:40,762 --> 1:17:44,681
Feel the bile rising
from your guilty past


460
1:17:44,681 --> 1:17:48,853
With your nerves in tatters
as the cockleshell shatters


461
1:17:48,853 --> 1:17:52,692
And the hammers batter down your door


462
1:17:52,692 --> 1:17:57,53
You better run
run, run, run


463
1:17:57,53 --> 1:18:9,25
Run, run, run, run


464
1:18:9,25 --> 1:18:13,339
You better run all day
and run all night


465
1:18:13,339 --> 1:18:17,343
Keep your dirty feelings deep inside


466
1:18:17,343 --> 1:18:21,472
And if you're taking
your girlfriend out tonight


467
1:18:21,472 --> 1:18:25,893
You'd better park the car
well out of sight


468
1:18:25,893 --> 1:18:29,815
'Cause if they catch you in
the back seat trying to pick her locks


469
1:18:29,815 --> 1:18:33,904
They're gonna send you back to Mother
in a cardboard box


470
1:18:33,904 --> 1:19:7,814
You better run


471
1:19:7,814 --> 1:19:14,238
You cannot reach me now


472
1:19:14,238 --> 1:19:19,409
No matter how you try


473
1:19:19,409 --> 1:19:22,372
Good-bye, cruel world


474
1:19:22,372 --> 1:19:24,958
It's over


475
1:19:24,958 --> 1:19:31,258
Walk on by


476
1:19:31,258 --> 1:19:33,26
Waiting


477
1:19:33,26 --> 1:19:36,428
- To cut out the dead wood
- Waiting


478
1:19:36,428 --> 1:19:39,848
- To weed out the weaklings
- Waiting


479
1:19:39,848 --> 1:19:43,604
To smash in their windows
and kick in their doors


480
1:19:43,604 --> 1:19:48,108
- Waiting
- For the final solution to strengthen the strain


481
1:19:48,108 --> 1:19:55,73
- Waiting
- To follow the worms


482
1:19:55,73 --> 1:19:58,453
- Would you like to see
- Would you like to see


483
1:19:58,453 --> 1:20:4,42
Britannia rule again


484
1:20:4,42 --> 1:20:8,172
My friend


485
1:20:8,172 --> 1:20:56,392
All you need to do
is follow the worms


486
1:20:56,392 --> 1:21:18,916
Hammer! Hammer!


487
1:21:18,916 --> 1:21:23,714
Hammer! Hammer! Hammer!


488
1:21:23,714 --> 1:23:17,379
Stop!


489
1:23:17,379 --> 1:23:25,302
Stop.


490
1:23:25,302 --> 1:23:31,184
I wanna go home


491
1:23:31,184 --> 1:23:38,776
Take off this uniform
and leave the show


492
1:23:38,776 --> 1:23:42,989
But I'm waiting in this cell


493
1:23:42,989 --> 1:23:47,744
Because I have to know


494
1:23:47,744 --> 1:23:51,249
Have I been


495
1:23:51,249 --> 1:24:47,434
Have I been guilty all this time


496
1:24:47,434 --> 1:24:50,438
Good morning, Worm, Your Honor


497
1:24:50,438 --> 1:24:52,856
The crown will plainly show


498
1:24:52,856 --> 1:24:56,734
The prisoner who now stands before you


499
1:24:56,734 --> 1:25:1,658
Was caught red-handed showing feelings


500
1:25:1,658 --> 1:25:7,29
Showing feelings
of an almost human nature


501
1:25:7,29 --> 1:25:11,125
This will not do


502
1:25:11,125 --> 1:25:13,421
Call the schoolmaster


503
1:25:13,421 --> 1:25:16,465
I always said he'd come to no good


504
1:25:16,465 --> 1:25:18,968
In the end, Your Honor


505
1:25:18,968 --> 1:25:21,512
If they'd let me have my way


506
1:25:21,512 --> 1:25:25,81
I could have flayed him into shape


507
1:25:25,81 --> 1:25:28,813
But my hands were tied


508
1:25:28,813 --> 1:25:31,273
The bleeding hearts and artists


509
1:25:31,273 --> 1:25:34,735
Let him get away with murder


510
1:25:34,735 --> 1:25:40,283
Let me hammer him today


511
1:25:40,283 --> 1:25:43,703
Crazy


512
1:25:43,703 --> 1:25:49,834
Toys in the attic
I am crazy


513
1:25:49,834 --> 1:25:56,843
Truly gone fishing


514
1:25:56,843 --> 1:26:2,85
They must have taken my marbles away


515
1:26:2,85 --> 1:26:6,27
Crazy


516
1:26:6,27 --> 1:26:17,32
Toys in the attic
He is crazy


517
1:26:17,32 --> 1:26:20,118
You little shit
You're in it now


518
1:26:20,118 --> 1:26:23,413
I hope they throw away the key


519
1:26:23,413 --> 1:26:27,751
You should've talked to me
more often than you did


520
1:26:27,751 --> 1:26:31,506
But no
You had to go your own way


521
1:26:31,506 --> 1:26:35,9
Have you broken
any homes up lately


522
1:26:35,9 --> 1:26:38,347
Just five minutes, Worm, Your Honor


523
1:26:38,347 --> 1:26:42,853
Him and me alone


524
1:26:42,853 --> 1:26:49,66
Babe


525
1:26:49,66 --> 1:26:51,36
Come to Mother, baby


526
1:26:51,36 --> 1:26:55,199
Let me hold you in my arms


527
1:26:55,199 --> 1:27:0,746
M'lud, I never wanted him
to get in any trouble


528
1:27:0,746 --> 1:27:4,82
Why'd he ever have to leave me


529
1:27:4,82 --> 1:27:9,754
Worm, Your Honor
let me take him home


530
1:27:9,754 --> 1:27:12,967
Crazy


531
1:27:12,967 --> 1:27:19,433
Over the rainbow
I'm crazy


532
1:27:19,433 --> 1:27:25,647
Bars in the window


533
1:27:25,647 --> 1:27:30,819
There must have been a door there
in the wall


534
1:27:30,819 --> 1:27:35,784
- When I came in
- Crazy


535
1:27:35,784 --> 1:27:45,795
Over the rainbow
He is crazy


536
1:27:45,795 --> 1:27:52,53
The evidence before the court
is incontrovertible


537
1:27:52,53 --> 1:27:58,392
There's no need
for the jury to retire


538
1:27:58,392 --> 1:28:1,102
In all my years of judging


539
1:28:1,102 --> 1:28:4,396
I have never heard before


540
1:28:4,396 --> 1:28:7,68
Of someone more deserving


541
1:28:7,68 --> 1:28:11,113
The full penalty of law


542
1:28:11,113 --> 1:28:13,617
The way you made them suffer


543
1:28:13,617 --> 1:28:17,372
Your exquisite wife and mother


544
1:28:17,372 --> 1:28:23,586
Fills me with the urge to defecate


545
1:28:23,586 --> 1:28:29,342
Since, my friend
you have revealed your deepest fear


546
1:28:29,342 --> 1:28:33,221
I sentence you to be exposed


547
1:28:33,221 --> 1:28:36,348
Before your peers


548
1:28:36,348 --> 1:31:45,388
Tear down the wall


549
1:31:45,388 --> 1:31:47,932
All alone


550
1:31:47,932 --> 1:31:51,646
Or in two's


551
1:31:51,646 --> 1:31:59,696
The ones who really love you


552
1:31:59,696 --> 1:32:2,699
Walk up and down


553
1:32:2,699 --> 1:32:10,414
Outside the wall


554
1:32:10,414 --> 1:32:16,297
Some hand in hand


555
1:32:16,297 --> 1:32:23,136
Some gathered together in bands


556
1:32:23,136 --> 1:32:28,477
The bleeding hearts
and the artists


557
1:32:28,477 --> 1:32:34,234
Make their stand


558
1:32:34,234 --> 1:32:39,697
And when they've given you their all


559
1:32:39,697 --> 1:32:42,618
Some stagger and fall


560
1:32:42,618 --> 1:32:48,291
After all, it's not easy


561
1:32:48,291 --> 1:32:50,876
Banging your heart


562
1:32:50,876 --> 1:34:13,674
Against some mad bugger's wall


563
1:34:13,674 --> 1:34:18,888
When they've given you their all


564
1:34:18,888 --> 1:34:21,6
Some stagger and fall


565
1:34:21,6 --> 1:36:21,6
After all, it's not easy
