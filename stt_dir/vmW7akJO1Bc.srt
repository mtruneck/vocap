CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: Hello and welcome to
CNN STUDENT NEWS on this Thursday, October


2
0:0:4,85 --> 0:0:10,5
18th. A fair warning: if you enjoy being outside
soaking up the sun, you might be a little


3
0:0:10,5 --> 0:0:29,62
jealous by the end of today show. The extraterrestrial
explanations coming up in just a bit.


4
0:0:29,62 --> 0:0:34,249
First up today, we have an update for you
on Malala Yousafzai. She is the 14-year old


5
0:0:34,249 --> 0:0:39,3
from Pakistan who was attacked and shot by
the Taliban recently. Malala had spoken out


6
0:0:39,3 --> 0:0:43,55
against the group and called for education
rights for girls. That`s something that the


7
0:0:43,55 --> 0:0:49,359
Taliban are against. On Monday, Malala was
airlifted from Pakistan to a hospital in England


8
0:0:49,359 --> 0:0:54,42
for specialized medical treatment. Doctors
say, her recovery could take months. As of


9
0:0:54,42 --> 0:1:0,139
Wednesday, Malala was in stable condition,
but she wasn`t able to speak. Malala was attacked


10
0:1:0,139 --> 0:1:4,25
on October 9th on her way home from school.
And she wasn`t the only one who was hurt in


11
0:1:4,25 --> 0:1:9,39
the shooting. Reza Sayah traveled to the region
in Pakistan where Malala is from. He talked


12
0:1:9,39 --> 0:1:13,869
to one of the other girls who was shot that
day and visited their school. Here is his


13
0:1:13,869 --> 0:1:14,219
report.


14
0:1:14,219 --> 0:1:14,909
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


15
0:1:14,909 --> 0:1:20,869
REZA SAYAH, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The city of
Mangora in Pakistan`s scenic Swat Valley.


16
0:1:20,869 --> 0:1:27,34
This is the region the Taliban took over in
2008, forcing shut then blowing up girls`


17
0:1:27,34 --> 0:1:33,2
schools. Threatening to kill anyone who stood
in their way. This is also where Malala Yousafzai


18
0:1:33,2 --> 0:1:40,119
and her classmate Kainat Ahmed (ph) defied
the Taliban by going to school anyway. Kainat


19
0:1:40,119 --> 0:1:46,79
was seated next to Malala when Taliban gunman
stopped their school van and opened fire.


20
0:1:46,79 --> 0:1:51,2
One of the bullets hit Kainat in the arm.


21
0:1:51,2 --> 0:1:56,49
In her hospital room, a mob of reporters shoved
their way through for a glimpse of Kainat`s


22
0:1:56,49 --> 0:1:59,64
ten minutes visit with Pakistan`s interior
minister.


23
0:1:59,64 --> 0:2:6,329
(on camera): Do you regret standing up against
the Taliban now that you`ve been hurt?


24
0:2:6,329 --> 0:2:10,759
KAINAT AHMED, INJURED IN TALIBAN ATTACK (through
translator): No, sir, I don`t regret it. God


25
0:2:10,759 --> 0:2:12,44
willing, I will continue my education.


26
0:2:12,44 --> 0:2:15,4
SAYAH: What do you want the world to know?


27
0:2:15,4 --> 0:2:21,19
AHMED: Girls` education here is more important
than boys`. Because boys can have any jobs


28
0:2:21,19 --> 0:2:26,17
they want to, but girls cannot. I want to
tell all the girls to continue their mission


29
0:2:26,17 --> 0:2:27,48
to get an education.


30
0:2:27,48 --> 0:2:33,599
SAYAH: We have left Kainat in the hospital,
we are heading to Malala`s school, and we


31
0:2:33,599 --> 0:2:39,599
are really racing at high speeds and in armed
convoy. And it shows you, even thought the


32
0:2:39,599 --> 0:2:43,78
government says, they`ve cleared the Taliban
out of this region, there are still a lot


33
0:2:43,78 --> 0:2:45,53
of safety concerns.


34
0:2:45,53 --> 0:2:50,28
We arrived at Malala`s school, this is where
Kainat went to school as well, so did Shazi


35
0:2:50,28 --> 0:2:55,83
(ph) and the other school girl who was hurt.
When the Taliban took over this region, this


36
0:2:55,83 --> 0:3:1,22
was one of the few girls` schools that remained
open. The headmaster was Malala`s father.


37
0:3:1,22 --> 0:3:4,33
He essentially said, no, we are staying open.


38
0:3:4,33 --> 0:3:9,349
Much of what Malala learned was in classrooms
here, despite the attack on students here,


39
0:3:9,349 --> 0:3:12,19
the school opened three days after the shooting.


40
0:3:12,19 --> 0:3:16,409
(on camera): How can you take practical steps
to make sure these little girls are safe?


41
0:3:16,409 --> 0:3:18,819
REHMAN MALIK, PAKISTANI INTERIOR MINISTER:
We are taking practical steps, but we have


42
0:3:18,819 --> 0:3:22,79
to change the mindset. There is the mindset
we need to change. And the first practical


43
0:3:22,79 --> 0:3:25,439
step is, to take action against (inaudible),
these terrorists.


44
0:3:25,439 --> 0:3:30,849
SAYAH (voice over): Before she was attacked,
Malala was working on starting a charity to


45
0:3:30,849 --> 0:3:35,909
promote female education. In the report, you
just heard Kainat talking about the importance


46
0:3:35,909 --> 0:3:40,549
of girls getting an education in Pakistan.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What`s the word? Is the
study of objects and materials that are outside


52
0:3:54,879 --> 0:3:58,34
of Earth`s atmosphere?


53
0:3:58,34 --> 0:4:2,17
Astronomy, that`s the word.


54
0:4:2,17 --> 0:4:6,739
(END VIDEO CLIP)


55
0:4:6,739 --> 0:4:13,84
AZUZ: There is a lot of sky. A lot of universe
out there for astronomers to study, sometimes


56
0:4:13,84 --> 0:4:18,34
those astronomers at NASA crowd source, and
what that means, is they give wide groups


57
0:4:18,34 --> 0:4:22,78
of people access to the same information to
see if they can come up with anything.


58
0:4:22,78 --> 0:4:27,55
For example, the Kepler telescope, that`s
what this is, its mission is to search the


59
0:4:27,55 --> 0:4:34,81
galaxy and collect data about stars and planets.
And NASA made this data available to the public,


60
0:4:34,81 --> 0:4:40,24
and that`s how two amateur astronomers discovered
something like this: it`s called a circum


61
0:4:40,24 --> 0:4:46,5
binary planet, which means it orbits two suns,
only the one that was just discovered is believed


62
0:4:46,5 --> 0:4:53,27
to be orbited by two more distant stars, so
you are looking at one planet, four suns.


63
0:4:53,27 --> 0:4:57,759
The citizen scientists compared their findings
with professional astronomers to confirm the


64
0:4:57,759 --> 0:5:0,509
finding of the four star planet.


65
0:5:0,509 --> 0:5:4,509
This yellow wristbands you are probably seeing
all over the place are from the Live Strong


66
0:5:4,509 --> 0:5:9,99
cancer charity. Cyclist Lance Armstrong who
was a cancer survivor helped found that organization


67
0:5:9,99 --> 0:5:15,87
15 years ago. Yesterday, he announced he is
stepping down as LiveStrong`s chairman.


68
0:5:15,87 --> 0:5:22,669
The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency says it has overwhelming
evidence that Armstrong used banned performance-enhancing


69
0:5:22,669 --> 0:5:27,52
drugs during his career. Armstrong denies
doping, he said he is walking away from the


70
0:5:27,52 --> 0:5:34,9
Live Strong organization to "spare the foundation
any negative effects as a result of controversy


71
0:5:34,9 --> 0:5:35,59
surrounding my cycling career."

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Today`s "Shoutout" goes
out to Mr. Ibarra and the students and teachers


74
0:5:41,97 --> 0:5:45,5
at Lunsford Middle School in Chantilly, Virginia.


75
0:5:45,5 --> 0:5:52,44
What is the capital of Texas? You know what
to do, is it Dallas, Houston, Austin or ElPaso?


76
0:5:52,44 --> 0:5:56,9
You`ve got three seconds, go!


77
0:5:56,9 --> 0:6:7,31
The capital of the lone start state is its
fourth largest city Austin. That`s your answer


78
0:6:7,31 --> 0:6:9,729
and that`s your "Shoutout."


79
0:6:9,729 --> 0:6:11,55
(END VIDEO CLIP)


80
0:6:11,55 --> 0:6:16,71
AZUZ: Just outside of Austin, you can hop
on highway 130 to toll road, and it`s one


81
0:6:16,71 --> 0:6:22,139
way to get from the state`s fourth largest
city to its second largest, which is San Antonio.


82
0:6:22,139 --> 0:6:26,639
But if you do take highway 130, starting next
month, you might be able to make that trip


83
0:6:26,639 --> 0:6:32,819
a little faster. That is because the speed
limit is going up for a stretch of 41 miles.


84
0:6:32,819 --> 0:6:38,5
The new limit will be 85 miles per hours.
When that happens, this section of highway


85
0:6:38,5 --> 0:6:44,36
130 will officially become the fastest road
in America. 35 states have raised speed limits


86
0:6:44,36 --> 0:6:49,69
to 70 or higher. And the engineers who built
this one, say that 85 is the safe and right


87
0:6:49,69 --> 0:6:54,889
speed for highway 130. But some safety expert
have raised concerns. They say that increasing


88
0:6:54,889 --> 0:6:59,379
speed limits leads to more accidents and more
severe injuries in those accidents.


89
0:6:59,379 --> 0:7:3,52
All right, we are going to stay on the road
for this next report, but we are going to


90
0:7:3,52 --> 0:7:8,169
move into the bike lane. Now, you`ve seen
road bikes, mountain bikes, dirt bikes, but


91
0:7:8,169 --> 0:7:13,47
the two wheeler that Isha Sesay is talking
about, is in the class all its own. And that


92
0:7:13,47 --> 0:7:16,759
is because of the material that it`s made
out of. Check this out:


93
0:7:16,759 --> 0:7:17,28
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


94
0:7:17,28 --> 0:7:21,44
ISHA SESAY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Setting the
wheels in motion on a breakthrough: with its


95
0:7:21,44 --> 0:7:27,539
pedal power and traditional two wheel frame,
this may look like a typical bicycle. But


96
0:7:27,539 --> 0:7:32,639
the Israeli entrepreneurs behind this bike
call it the future of low cost transportation.


97
0:7:32,639 --> 0:7:39,3
NIMROD ELMISH, CARDBOARD BICYCLE PROJECT:
Basically, this bicycle is built out of 95


98
0:7:39,3 --> 0:7:45,8
percent recycled cardboard, which is the most
cheapest raw material that you can find in any country.


99
0:7:45,8 --> 0:7:50,31
SESAY: And there is no metal parts. The rest
is recycled car tires and plastic bottles.


100
0:7:50,31 --> 0:7:58,0
Not only is the bike eco-friendly, it's cheap.
Each costs just $9 to build. 


101
0:7:58,0 --> 0:8:1,97
Inventor Izhar Gafni (ph) came up with the design
in his backyard chair.


102
0:8:1,97 --> 0:8:5,629
IZHAR GAFNI, INVENTOR, CARDBOARD BICYCLE:
What I did is when I took the cardboard I


103
0:8:5,629 --> 0:8:10,93
tried to overcome all the weaknesses that
 the cardboard as a shipping material as we all know had.


104
0:8:10,93 --> 0:8:16,71
SESAY: Using a secret process, Gafni says
his cardboard bike is both waterproof and


105
0:8:16,71 --> 0:8:22,349
fire resistant. And by using green materials
and keeping production costs low, he hopes


106
0:8:22,349 --> 0:8:25,199
the bikes can be given away in poor countries.


107
0:8:25,199 --> 0:8:30,139
ELMISH: When you see something like this,
you understand quite fast that this is a real


108
0:8:30,139 --> 0:8:36,35
game changer. I know that the lifespan of
the regular bike is maximum five years. So,


109
0:8:36,35 --> 0:8:41,51
in five years basically I can replace all
of them, because that would be cheaper, faster,


110
0:8:41,51 --> 0:8:44,52
stronger and ecological.


111
0:8:44,52 --> 0:8:50,5
SESAY: Production is set to begin on three
bicycle modules and a wheelchair. They should


112
0:8:50,5 --> 0:8:54,19
be on sale within a year. Isha Sesay, CNN,
Atlanta.


113
0:8:54,19 --> 0:8:55,15
(END VIDEOTAPE)


114
0:8:55,15 --> 0:9:1,64
AZUZ: So, a cardboard bike might work, but
a cardboard anchor - that could produce some


115
0:9:1,64 --> 0:9:4,98
challenges. For example, trying to get him
to ride a bike. We thought this will be off


116
0:9:4,98 --> 0:9:9,48
the chain, but it didn`t really work. He can`t
figure out how to sip hot chocolate, needs


117
0:9:9,48 --> 0:9:13,4
someone to spill it out for him. All right,
man, stop mugging for the camera.


118
0:9:13,4 --> 0:9:17,66
He doesn`t need much help getting ready to
go on camera, but, you know, this can go - hair


119
0:9:17,66 --> 0:9:19,26
today, gone tomorrow.


120
0:9:19,26 --> 0:9:24,39
Especially since he is an absolutely terrible
news anchor. Look at him, always falling down


121
0:9:24,39 --> 0:9:28,46
on the job. You know, it`s worse that we came
up with all of these plans and all of these


122
0:9:28,46 --> 0:9:33,68
situations for cardboard Carl, but in all
of them, his performance was absolutely flat.


123
0:9:33,68 --> 0:9:37,78
Well, we did the best we card, and hopefully,
you weren`t board by it. Back tomorrow to


124
0:9:37,78 --> 0:9:39,64
close out the week. I`m Carl Azuz.


125
0:9:39,64 --> 0:11:39,64
Let`s go, Buddy.
