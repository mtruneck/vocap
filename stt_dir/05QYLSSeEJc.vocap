###0 NIMROD KAMER: Venice, 2012.
###2 The 69th Annual Film Festival.
###5 I had arrived in style to sell a Pierce Brosnan sex tape.
###9 I was financing my trip for the sale of MDMA NYPD stolen
###13 from Macaulay Culkin's kitchen.
###16 But most importantly, I had enjoyed some creamy puddings.
###21 I am Nimrod Kamer, a social climber disguised as a
###24 journalist, and this is my film, "How To Make It #Huge In
###28 The Film Industry (And Also Get Fingered.)"
###33 I had achieved so much already, so I splashed out on
###36 a food salad and a glass of spritz.
###39 You can put it on Michael Fassbender's room account.
###42 It's OK.
###43 Room, I think, 344 or something.
###47 The cold food made me realize that to make it #enorm in the
###50 film industry, I had to be among the Venice 1%.
###52 
###56 I want to put money in films, actually.
###58 I'm a merchant in Venice.
###59 MIRAMAX CEO: Cool.
###60 NIMROD KAMER: I want to put some money on films, but if
###63 you don't pay me back, I have take a piece of your flesh.
###66 MIRAMAX CEO: [LAUGHING]
###67 Call it good collateral.
###68 NIMROD KAMER: Small piece, yeah.
###70 - Scuzi.
###70 It's private.
###72 NIMROD KAMER: Private party?
###73 
###76 See you later.
###78 
###81 Film finance and XLS files were so boring, so I casually
###86 wandered down the street where I bumped into my old pal,
###89 Danny Huston.
###91 Danny and I go way back and almost always agree on
###94 everything.
###95 DANNY HUSTON: Yes, yes, yes.
###96 Yes, yes,
###96 NIMROD KAMER: Yeah, yeah.
###97 DANNY HUSTON: Uh huh.
###98 I had Danny in mind for the lead role in an [INAUDIBLE]
###101 book I'd optioned.
###102 ARI EMANUEL: A friend of mine that I'm talking to is selling
###105 the movie rights to "50 Shades of Grey."
###109 NIMROD KAMER: It's about spanking and submissive sex.
###113 Soft stuff.
###114 ARI EMANUEL: We will talk more.
###116 NIMROD KAMER: Legitimate.
###118 
###123 I set up a meeting with Harvey Weinstein about a visionary
###126 sci-fi idea I had.
###130 NIMROD KAMER: Just for a sec.
###131 NIMROD KAMER: I just want to say.
###133 NIMROD KAMER: I'm leaving.
###133 I just want to do the remake of the remake of "Total
###136 Recall."
###139 NIMROD KAMER: Yeah.
###139 The remake of the remake, because "Total Recall" was the
###141 best remake ever.
###142 You should remake that.
###143 Good to see you, girls.
###145 Yeah.
###146 I have Pierce Brosnan sex tape.
###149 NIMROD KAMER: Thanks.
###151 
###154 NIMROD KAMER: I could tell Harvey Weinstein was
###156 interested by the movement of his chin.
###158 It was only a matter of time before he bid.
###161 What I needed now was actors.
###164 I can be your agent in London.
###166 I can put you in corporate infomercials and
###169 all kinds of stuff.
###170 JOE PESCI'S BROTHER: Really?
###171 NIMROD KAMER: Yeah, yeah.
###172 JOE PESCI'S BROTHER: Can you give me your card?
###173 NIMROD KAMER: I can represent you in Paris and the Middle
###175 East if you want.
###176 I'm an agent, yeah.
###178 I'm an agent, a manager, and a lawyer.
###180 I can represent her, yeah.
###182 I can give you stationery, because my grandfather, he
###185 owns a stationery shop.
###186 MICHAEL LONSDALE: What's that?
###187 NIMROD KAMER: It's like pencils and clipboards.
###191 Have you ever done, like, nude scenes?
###193 [LAUGHING]
###195 NIMROD KAMER: I can give you my card, definitely.
###199 I got some condoms here.
