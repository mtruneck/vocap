###26 POLICE OFFICER: We were getting phone calls, doing
###27 things that weren't real smart, weren't real safe.
###30 You know, in a group like this, everything kind of
###31 sticks out.
###32 Enjoy your ride and have a good time, but don't do
###34 anything crazy, OK?
###35 Thank you.
###35 GROUP: [IN UNISON]
###36 Thank you.
###36 PATRICK O'DELL: Hello, welcome back to the
###37 "Epicly Later'd" show.
###38 This episode is the mild ride, which is Ruca's Vespa tour.
###44 And we went from Los Angeles to San
###46 Francisco, back to Los Angeles.
###48 And it was a really mellow tour, like mellow demos at
###52 like Derby Park in Santa Cruz, and, like,
###55 just real mellow stuff.
###56 And so this is it, the Mild Ride Tour.
###59 
###62 -[INAUDIBLE]
###64 Devouring its future.
###66 Hey, Sean, Jimmy.
###68 We're on Treasure Island at a Navy base, so call me back.
###72 All right, bye.
###72 PATRICK O'DELL: Have you been here before?
###74 KEEGAN SAUDER: Uh, no.
###75 I've never been to Treasure Island.
###78 
###113 PATRICK O'DELL: What are you building?
###115 JOSH HARMONY: Getting that Vespa in here,
###117 so we can get launched.
###118 
###126 -Ha!
###128 JOSH HARMONY: So you're just going to stop.
###129 Maybe you should, like, turn to the right.
###130 -I'll do it, but I'm going to turn.
###132 Yeah, I'm going to turn, but I'm going to stop.
###133 I'm not going to go anywhere.
###134 
###140 [APPLAUSE AND CHEERS]
###146 -Is this urine?
###147 -That's definitely urine.
###149 Urine throw.
###150 [CRASH]
###151 [LAUGHS]
###153 Urine!
###154 PATRICK O'DELL: You know this is a mature skate tour.
###156 ETHAN FOWLER: Of course, yeah, in all ways.
###159 JOSH HARMONY: If by mature you mean totally awesome, then
###163 you're right.
###164 
###167 AUSTIN STEPHENS: I don't know.
###168 I don't know how to sum it up.
###169 I don't know, it's been really silly.
###171 These things are kind of silly.
###174 It just got banged up a little bit.
###175 But I think they kind of have to expect that.
###179 If you're lending out like a group of Vespas to a group of
###181 skateboarders, it's kind of maybe somewhat expected.
###185 That's just the--
###186 it's just the edge of the world right now.
###188 KEEGAN SAUDER: Yeah.
###188 AUSTIN STEPHENS: There's no ocean down there.
###191 It's just completely clouds and just universe out there.
###197 PATRICK O'DELL: How was this drive so far?
###199 AUSTIN STEPHENS: Well, pretty beautiful, as you can see.
###202 
###215 -[GROWLING]
###220 
###233 KEEGAN SAUDER: Just slide around and shit.
###235 Just go until you loop out.
###237 ETHAN FOWLER: Yeah.
###237 KEEGAN SAUDER: Board almost hits you in the face.
###239 PATRICK O'DELL: What about Ethan?
###240 How long have you known him?
###241 KEEGAN SAUDER: I think I met him three years.
###244 He is one of my favorite skaters.
###246 I looked up to him 10 since I was about--
###248 you know, when that first stereo video came out, I was
###251 like 14, 15, so yeah, he is kind of--
###255 he is Ethan Fowler.
###256 To me, he's fucking sick.
###259 
###263 [CHEERING]
###266 
###277 PATRICK O'DELL: What about the other night.
###278 Were you in the hotel room?
###278 Oh yeah, you were in the hotel room--
###279 KEEGAN SAUDER: Yeah, yeah.
###280 PATRICK O'DELL: --when he was like ranting and
###282 philosophizing.
###284 KEEGAN SAUDER: Yeah, well, he'd had a couple road pops,
###286 so the conversation was flowing.
###291 ETHAN FOWLER: We went to Burnside.
###292 My first time at Burnside was on a
###294 fucking eighth of mushrooms.
###296 I got it, dude.
###297 It was the most satisfying demo of my life.
###302 PATRICK O'DELL: Today?
###302 Really?
###303 ETHAN FOWLER: Yeah.
###304 
###309 It was fun.
###310 KEEGAN SAUDER: It was a fun session.
###314 ETHAN FOWLER: It was.
###314 KEEGAN SAUDER: It was like a session.
###315 It wasn't like a demo.
###316 ETHAN FOWLER: Exactly.
###316 That's what I'm saying.
###320 
###331 KEEGAN SAUDER: This happened.
###332 
###335 Hello.
###337 
###345 ETHAN FOWLER: I think that's seriously the longest I've
###347 skated at a demo in years, multiple years.
###351 I told you that.
###352 KEEGAN SAUDER: You said eight years.
###353 ETHAN FOWLER: Serious, and I'm not even kidding.
###354 KEEGAN SAUDER: You said it was the first time you'd skated
###356 more than 10 minutes.
###357 ETHAN FOWLER: I swear to God, that's not even a joke.
###360 Like, it was a good time, like goofing about, you know?
###364 It still was fun.
###367 [IMITATING CHARACTER VOICE]
###367 Did I tell you about the one time I'm at that computer, and
###371 the last time I talked to that girl was a bad time.
###376 KEEGAN SAUDER: Are you doing Sling Blade right now?
###379 ETHAN FOWLER: Yeah, right?
###380 Yeah, it was good, huh?
###381 KEEGAN SAUDER: That was so Sling Blade.
###382 ETHAN FOWLER: Yeah.
###385 [IMITATING CHARACTER VOICE]
###385 Man, I'll tell you one time-- every time I took that liquor,
###389 I came down a bad man.
###393 PATRICK O'DELL: Hi, welcome back to the show.
###394 At the end of the Mild Ride Tour, I started interviewing
###397 Ethan a lot.
###398 I think on the tour, I forgot who he was.
###400 Maybe with the beard, I couldn't remember.
###402 And then I'd see him skate-- and I was like, damn, that's
###405 Ethan Fowler.
###406 
###410 I don't know.
###410 He's just a real influential, stylish skater.
###414 I've been following his career for a long time.
###415 So I just met up with him and started asking him these
###418 questions just to sort of do like a little retrospective of
###422 Ethan Fowler's pro career.
###424 So that's what this is.
###425 The Ethan Fowler episode.
###427 PATRICK O'DELL: Oh, don't let him eat the mic.
###430 ETHAN FOWLER: He ain't gonna eat it.
###433 Looks like Henry Rollins.
###435 PATRICK O'DELL: I interviewed Ed the other day, and I asked
###436 him about you.
###436 And speaking of Rollins, he said when he first met you,
###439 you were, like, really into Rollins and vegetarian.
###443 ETHAN FOWLER: Yep.
###445 And a stint of veganism as well.
###447 PATRICK O'DELL: Really?
###448 ETHAN FOWLER: Indeed, yeah.
###449 It's kind of weird for a 14-year-old kid, I think.
###453 I don't know.
###453 PATRICK O'DELL: How did you meet Ed?
###455 ETHAN FOWLER: My buddy Dave that I skated with was, I
###461 guess, buddies with Jerry Fowler.
###464 I don't know what, but I'd just gone skating with him,
###466 and then Jerry mentioned it to Ed.
###470 And I don't know, but we just ended up at the Huntington
###474 High School.
###475 [CHUCKLES]
###477 And skating around and shit.
###480 And, I don't know.
###481 I guess Ed was into it.
###486 ED TEMPLETON: Yeah, we we're just skating a lot back them.
###487 I mean, he was like a rad kid to skate with.
###490 And he was not just, like, a typical stake kid.
###493 He was interested in music, and art, and stuff.
###496 So it was kind of fun to be around a kid who was into that
###498 kind of stuff.
###499 He was super young.
###500 I mean, he was like, 15 or 16 when I first sponsored him.
###506 And he was just like beyond incredible.
###511 ETHAN FOWLER: And then Ed called and said we'd like to
###513 have you on board.
###514 So I said, I don't know.
###517 I mean, OK, turn me pro, and I'll ride for you.
###520 And he goes, OK.
###523 So that was that.
###523 PATRICK O'DELL: No way.
###525 ETHAN FOWLER: Yeah.
###526 PATRICK O'DELL: [LAUGHS]
###527 So wait, how old were you?
###529 ETHAN FOWLER: 15.
###530 PATRICK O'DELL: That's funny is that you were just like,
###532 make me pro.
###533 ETHAN FOWLER: Yeah.
###534 PATRICK O'DELL: That's pretty cool.
###534 ETHAN FOWLER: Yeah, it worked out, I guess, you know?
###539 ED TEMPLETON: And then the weird thing happened with us
###541 is, his parents moved to Iowa City, and that was
###546 devastating for him.
###547 His skate career was just starting.
###549 He's 16 years old.
###551 But his parents are going to move the some butt-fuck town
###553 and take him away from California and the whole skate
###556 scene and stuff.
###557 ETHAN FOWLER: Yeah, the whole family picked up and split and
###559 went to Iowa--
###560 well, except for my brother, who was of age.
###564 And Ed had offered to take me in, kind of like a guardian
###568 and all that, so I could further my career.
###574 But Mom wasn't having that, so--
###576 ED TEMPLETON: You know, don't worry, I'll be a good dad.
###578 And she was super pissed.
###581 I mean, she just got up and said, how dare you.
###584 Fuck you.
###584 And like walked out of the room.
###586 And I was just sitting there like, oh shit, I really, oh,
###589 this sucks.
###589 ETHAN FOWLER: Yeah, yeah, she was mad.
###591 It'd be an uncomfortable thing, your teenage son going
###595 to live with his employer buddy skate friend.
###601 
###604 ETHAN FOWLER: Which I ended up doing anyway, I mean, that
###608 was, like, inevitable.
###611 TOBIN YELLAND: I had never met Ethan Fowler before.
###613 I had driven across the United States.
###616 Thomas Campbell had come with us.
###618 And he had the idea to stop by his friend Ethan's house, who
###621 was, at that time, 16 years old.
###623 And he was a really amazing skateboarder.
###625 And Thomas' idea was to stop by his house, say hello to
###628 him, and shoot a bunch of photos.
###630 And maybe we can use him for Big Brother, you know, a
###633 magazine article or something.
###634 ETHAN FOWLER: They were coming through from New York, and I
###636 had met before and shot with Thomas and stuff.
###640 And we got along good, so they came through to shoot weird
###644 Iowa spots.
###645 And then they were splitting and said, well, we've got an
###649 extra seat.
###649 You want to come?
###650 And I said, well, yeah, but I do.
###654 And so I just had my shit in my backpack, like an extra
###658 pair of shoes and a shirt.
###660 And I was like, OK, let's go.
###661 And so I went to the bank and took out all my money and just
###664 got in and split.
###665 And that was it.
###666 End of story.
###667 PATRICK O'DELL: Didn't you tell your mom?
###669 ETHAN FOWLER: Yeah, I was there for three days.
###670 I called and said I live in San Francisco now.
###675 DAVE CARNIE: Yeah, one of the first times I met Ethan, it
###679 was his birthday.
###679 And me and Tobin went over to his house.
###683 And he was kind of weird.
###685 He just seemed-- he was just kind of odd.
###686 He was, like, playing jazz, and playing his drums, and
###689 listening to jazz music really loud, like really crazy jazz.
###693 And he was drinking whiskey.
###696 I remember that.
###697 And he was only 15 or something.
###700 And I was doing speed at the time.
###703 And so I offered him some speed.
###705 And he was like, oh, fuck yeah.
###707 And like, I didn't know he was 15 at the time.
###710 And then I learned later that he was drunk on whiskey, he
###716 was high on speed, but before all that, he had dropped two
###719 hits of acid.
###720 I don't know, obviously, I like that
###722 kind of thing in people.
###723 So we had a good time that night.
###725 ED TEMPLETON: So that's it, you know?
###726 I mean, basically, he was in our video during that time.
###730 That was the time we filmed for Toy Machine Live.
###733 So yeah, a lot of that footage from that period was like
###737 Ethan in his new phase, coming from Iowa City, and you can
###740 see him in the video smoking cigs and wearing cool vests
###744 and things.
###745 And within weeks of him being in SF, I get a call from him
###749 saying, I'm running for Stereo.
###752 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###763 CHRIS PASTRAS: Ethan just oozed style, man.
###765 We always used to say, like, it was as if he
###767 was born for Stereo.
###769 But I kind of had this vision of like, man, I want to get
###772 like some skate company going where it's all, like, solid
###777 skating, with big tricks, and not all the board hitting the
###781 ground at the same time as the dude or whatever.
###784 When he came along, it was like the golden child of
###787 Stereo basically.
###788 And we gave him two weeks to film that video part.
###791 And him and Tobin came back with this part, and they went
###794 out like four or five times.
###795 Like the Stereo video was like, this is what happens
###798 when you leave the house with a skateboard.
###801 PATRICK O'DELL: Did you film a lot of his Stereo part?
###803 TOBIN YELLAND: Yeah, I filmed, probably, most of it.
###805 And as well as, like, I filmed most of the video.
###808 And that was really fun.
###811 He's just like a prodigy skateboarder.
###813 So he just came to San Francisco, started filming for
###817 his part, and just, basically, kind of, like, made every
###821 trick that he tried.
###822 And he was just in this like--
###824 this kind of mode, just being like Superman skateboarder.
###827 KEEGAN SAUDER: Skateboarding was kind of shit back then.
###829 You know, small wheels, creeping at a curb, just doing
###833 the stab and wiggle, where you don't even ollie.
###835 You just like, uhh.
###837 And then, I don't know.
###838 These guys were skating fast and smooth.
###842 It was kind of like a precursor to Eastern Exposure.
###845 Like it was the start of skating getting good again.
###849 JAKE PHELPS: Chris Pastras and Jason Lee were in this very
###852 same office.
###853 And they were going, looking through their Ethan Fowler
###854 footage, and they were like, man, we fucking--
###857 we got lucky on this kid.
###858 Because he was 15, he won the world championships.
###860 You know, I'm not worthy, you know?
###863 He did a couple three flips and some flat grounds, some
###864 front boards, some big spins, and people were like--
###867 in a contest, unbelievable!
###869 Which is all normal now, but at that time, it was all
###872 really pretty earth shattering.
###874 Ethan, I think he was an amazing skater.
###878 He told me some really funny things in life, I think.
###882 He goes, Phelps, man--
###884 you know, this is when he was the slicked-back
###886 fucking teen wolf.
###888 I was like, all right, what is it?
###890 And he's like, everyone else is all trying
###891 to flip their board.
###892 Man, I just want to ollie everything.
###893 And he had supreme ollie powers.
###897 ETHAN FOWLER: But that was the whole idea.
###899 Like, I don't think anybody on that team was even remotely
###903 interested in sitting there for three hours trying to get
###907 some insane thing on a curb that they
###909 would make once a year.
###913 But no, at the time, I don't think it was--
###915 I mean, it was well received in small circles.
###917 But, like, for the most part, it was like, whatever.
###921 You know?
###922 Who are these goofballs?
###925 PATRICK O'DELL: More like contemporary videos, like--
###927 CHRIS PASTRAS: Virtual Reality.
###929 PATRICK O'DELL: Virtual reality.
###930 CHRIS PASTRAS: That was the one we were up against, I
###932 think, in terms of timing.
###934 And the first girl video, I think, had come out.
###937 Yeah, for sure Stereo definitely always got a strong
###940 reaction, one way or the other.
###943 That's for sure.
###944
