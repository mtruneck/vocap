###0 JACOB SOBOROFF: Hey, it's Jacob.
###1 Today we're hanging with Oscar nominees.
###3 JACOB SOBOROFF: Tripping with the most interesting man
###5 in Germany.
###6 [MUSIC - DER TOURIST,  "SUPERGEIL"]
###8 JACOB SOBOROFF: And running in circles.

###13 For the past three years, the Egyptian revolution
###15 has been a roller coaster.
###17 Two presidents have been deposed.
###19 Thousands of people have died.
###20 And just yesterday, the Prime Minister abruptly
###22 resigned his government. "The Square"
###23 is a newly released documentary that gives a street-level look
###26 at the ongoing revolution since 2011.
###38 JACOB SOBOROFF: It's up for an Oscar this Sunday,
###40 and we got the filmmaker Jehane and the producer Karim
###42 right here.
###43 Hey, guys.
###43 JEHANE NOUJAIM: Hey, what's up?
###44 KARIM AMER: How you doing, YouTube?
###45 JACOB SOBOROFF: Guys, tell us about the challenges
###46 of making a film like this.
###47 JEHANE NOUJAIM: All of us got either arrested, tear gassed,
###49 shot at at various points in the making of the film.
###52 JACOB SOBOROFF: So these guys just put the movie on YouTube
###54 for the people in Egypt.
###55 What motivated that, and how does it work, exactly?
###56 KARIM AMER: YouTube was an integral part
###58 of this revolution.
###58 When you live in a country where the media is in full control
###61 and is lying about what's happening on the ground,
###64 our young activists used YouTube as their own channel
###66 to spread their stories.
###67 JACOB SOBOROFF: Jehane's the only female director
###69 nominated for an Oscar this year.
###71 Where can people see this movie?
###72 JEHANE NOUJAIM: Well, you can see it
###74 on Netflix in 47 countries, including the US.
###76 And also, internationally, you can see it
###79 by going to our YouTube site.
###81 JACOB SOBOROFF: Thank you so much to these guys.
###82 We put together a playlist with moments of triumph
###84 from Tahrir Square.
###84 You can see that after the show.
###86 ALEX: I've seen this stunt hundreds of times
###88 before on bikes, skateboards, even a wheelchair,
###91 but I've never seen it on feet.
###93 Meet my new personal hero, Damien Walters.
###96 He's about to make history as the first human looper.
###98 
###101 MAN: Getting close.
###103 DAMIEN WALTERS: You can't really go any further
###105 until you take the mats out.
###108 
###114 ALEX: This insanity is all over the blogosphere.
###116 His channel is awesome.
###118 Subscribe if you want to see some crazy stunts
###120 and insane back loops.
###121 JACOB SOBOROFF: The most interesting man in the world
###122 has a German doppelganger in what
###124 is hands down the oddest video that I have seen today.
###127 This supermarket ad got almost two million views
###129 over the weekend.
###130 The guy in it is Friedrich Liechtenstein,
###133 an electronic music star.

###148 JACOB SOBOROFF: I think Centerfold Skye said it best.
###150 "When the apocalypse happens, I want
###152 to be Robin to this guy's Batman."
###156 ROB HUGEL: What's up, YouTube Nation?
###158 My name is Rob.
###159 You might know me from the series "I Hate Being Single."
###161 WOMAN 1: When was the last time you got laid, little ho?
###163 ROB HUGEL: Stop calling me little ho.
###164 WOMAN 1: It's a compliment.
###164 WOMAN 2: Ain't nothing wrong with being a ho.
###166 ROB HUGEL: Today I want to tell you
###166 about a new series I made called "Man vs Waiter."
###169 The man is on a date.
###170 The waiter is a part of that date by default.
###173 WAITER: Can I get you stated with something to drink?
###176 DATE: You know, water's fine for me.
###178 ROB HUGEL: I'll have water also.
###180 WAITER: Listen man, you're on a date, right?
###182 ROB HUGEL: Yeah.
###182 WAITER: See, it's customary to buy an alcoholic beverage,
###185 at least for your date.
###187 ROB HUGEL: Watch to find out what
###188 happens between man and waiter.
###190 Definitely subscribe to "I Hate Being Single," because there's
###192 going to be new stuff coming out every week, probably
###195 for eternity.
###196 JACOB SOBOROFF: If you like what you see, guys,
###197 go to Rob's channel.
###198 Check out season one of his series.
###199 He's actually doing an Indiegogo campaign to finance season two,
###202 and that ends tomorrow.
###204 EARNEST: Hey, it's Earnest, and I
###205 am sitting on something that's pretty remarkable.
###207 Justin Bieber's "Baby" has passed a billion views
###210 on YouTube and VEVO combined.
###211 So however you feel about Justin Bieber,
###213 if you love him, if you hate him, it's a billion views.
###215 And that's pretty remarkable.
###216 And also, see if you can spot Drake in the video.
###218 [MUSIC - JUSTIN BIEBER, "BABY"]
###219 
###223 JACOB SOBOROFF: Thanks, Earnest.
###225 The only other video ever to cross a billion views
###227 is "Gangnam Style."
###228 We want you in the show.
###229 Film yourself talking about a video
###231 you love, and then post it with the hashtag YouTubeNation.
###234 Now play us out, Chromeo.
