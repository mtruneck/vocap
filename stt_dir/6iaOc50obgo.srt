1
0:0:15,4 --> 0:0:21,96
Sophie, could you
come in here, please ?


2
0:0:21,96 --> 0:0:24,4
Yes, Damien ?


3
0:0:24,4 --> 0:0:26,24
I've been thinking.


4
0:0:26,24 --> 0:0:28,28
We've become rather staid recently.


5
0:0:28,28 --> 0:0:29,8
We haven't really produced


6
0:0:29,8 --> 0:0:33,12
any truly interesting titles
for some time.


7
0:0:33,12 --> 0:0:39,68
We need some new... blood.


8
0:0:39,68 --> 0:0:41,6
Did you have anyone in mind ?


9
0:0:41,6 --> 0:0:43,6
I was rather hoping you might.


10
0:0:43,6 --> 0:0:46,4
How about Peter Gibbons ?


11
0:0:46,4 --> 0:0:50,4
I don't think so.


12
0:0:50,4 --> 0:0:51,16
Jason Murray ?


13
0:0:51,16 --> 0:0:55,32
Too... arty.


14
0:0:55,32 --> 0:0:58,44
- Tim Bisley.
- Bisley ?


15
0:0:58,44 --> 0:1:0,36
Why do I know that name ?


16
0:1:0,36 --> 0:1:2,48
'He came in last year.


17
0:1:2,48 --> 0:1:4,36
'You laughed him out of the office.


18
0:1:4,36 --> 0:1:6,56
'He had blond hair.


19
0:1:6,56 --> 0:1:7,76
'Small ears.'


20
0:1:7,76 --> 0:1:11,28
Yes, Bisley. That's right.


21
0:1:11,28 --> 0:1:13,2
I remember his work now.


22
0:1:13,2 --> 0:1:16,44
All muscles and guns. Most amusing.


23
0:1:16,44 --> 0:1:18,52
Give him a ring, will you Sophie ?


24
0:1:18,52 --> 0:1:23,96
- Get me his portfolio.
- Ok.


25
0:1:23,96 --> 0:1:43,32
I think it's time we gave
young Mr Bisley another shot.


26
0:1:43,32 --> 0:1:47,32
# Oh, baby


27
0:1:47,32 --> 0:1:51,76
# Oh, baby


28
0:1:51,76 --> 0:1:57,48
# Oh, baby #


29
0:1:57,48 --> 0:2:2,8
You idiot.


30
0:2:2,8 --> 0:2:5,32
- Morning. Coffee and Kilroy ?
- No thanks.


31
0:2:5,32 --> 0:2:7,0
- Tea and Tricia ?
- No !


32
0:2:7,0 --> 0:2:8,76
Why are you scrimmaging around ?


33
0:2:8,76 --> 0:2:12,28
- Sophie from Darkstar called.
- Sophie.


34
0:2:12,28 --> 0:2:14,28
Damien Knox wants to see
my portfolio.


35
0:2:14,28 --> 0:2:15,44
Sophie.


36
0:2:15,44 --> 0:2:18,28
No, Damien Knox.
The head of Darkstar Comix.


37
0:2:18,28 --> 0:2:21,36
He wants to see my portfolio.
I am a little nervous.


38
0:2:21,36 --> 0:2:24,48
God, wow. He wants
to see your portfolio ?


39
0:2:24,48 --> 0:2:26,72
God, what a break.
That's brilliant.


40
0:2:26,72 --> 0:2:28,4
- Is it, Daisy ?
- Yeah.


41
0:2:28,4 --> 0:2:29,96
God, well done.


42
0:2:29,96 --> 0:2:32,52
That's excellent. Really good.
Well done, you.


43
0:2:32,52 --> 0:2:37,88
Well done.


44
0:2:37,88 --> 0:2:39,52
- What's that ?
- I don't know.


45
0:2:39,52 --> 0:2:41,92
It's upstairs. Maybe it's Marsha.


46
0:2:41,92 --> 0:2:45,68
- Maybe it's Mike.
- Maybe it's Mike AND Marsha.


47
0:2:45,68 --> 0:2:47,88
Ready to go again, soldier ?


48
0:2:47,88 --> 0:2:52,0
Cock-locked and ready to rock.


49
0:2:52,0 --> 0:2:53,56
Got anything planned ?


50
0:2:53,56 --> 0:2:55,68
I have got a bit of a project.


51
0:2:55,68 --> 0:2:57,36
I'm gonna be
as inactive as I can


52
0:2:57,36 --> 0:3:0,44
in order to get into the psyche
of someone unemployed,


53
0:3:0,44 --> 0:3:2,28
vocationally and cerebrally,


54
0:3:2,28 --> 0:3:6,2
to see if enforced passivity
exacerbates itself.


55
0:3:6,2 --> 0:3:8,48
Does inactivity breed laziness ?


56
0:3:8,48 --> 0:3:19,8
- You writing an article on it ?
- No. I can't be bothered.


57
0:3:19,8 --> 0:3:22,4
I'm not really a praying man and
I never really ask you for much,


58
0:3:22,4 --> 0:3:25,56
so if you could see your
way clear to helping me today,


59
0:3:25,56 --> 0:3:27,84
I would be really grateful.


60
0:3:27,84 --> 0:3:41,28
Thank you very much. Amen.


61
0:3:41,28 --> 0:3:50,64
"I'm a massive wanker."


62
0:3:50,64 --> 0:3:58,4
It's all right.
It's my messenger.


63
0:3:58,4 --> 0:3:59,88
- That's weird.
- What ?


64
0:3:59,88 --> 0:4:2,2
- There's nobody there.
- Oi oi !


65
0:4:2,2 --> 0:4:4,64
You lucky people.


66
0:4:4,64 --> 0:4:7,32
Oh, hi, Tyres.


67
0:4:7,32 --> 0:4:10,76
I understand you two "friends"
wanted to talk to me.


68
0:4:10,76 --> 0:4:14,4
I was wondering if you could run
my portfolio over to Darkstar.


69
0:4:14,4 --> 0:4:15,8
I see. You don't
call me for weeks


70
0:4:15,8 --> 0:4:17,84
and all of a sudden
you want a favour.


71
0:4:17,84 --> 0:4:20,36
That's nice. The last time
I seen you, you said


72
0:4:20,36 --> 0:4:21,96
you wished I was your da


73
0:4:21,96 --> 0:4:23,88
and hugged me
for the entire length


74
0:4:23,88 --> 0:4:26,44
of Josh Wink's Higher State
of Consciousness.


75
0:4:26,44 --> 0:4:29,32
And now you want me to ferry
round your "art" ?


76
0:4:29,32 --> 0:4:31,96
- Yes, please.
- Ok.


77
0:4:31,96 --> 0:4:33,56
By the way, you owe me 20 quid.


78
0:4:33,56 --> 0:4:35,76
Oh, right. Yeah.


79
0:4:35,76 --> 0:4:37,92
How are you,
my pocket Shakespeare ?


80
0:4:37,92 --> 0:4:40,44
Come up with any exciting
literary characters ?


81
0:4:40,44 --> 0:4:41,96
Yes, actually.


82
0:4:41,96 --> 0:4:43,68
Dizzy Steinway.


83
0:4:43,68 --> 0:4:45,12
I like it.


84
0:4:45,12 --> 0:4:48,2
What is she, some sort of
crime-busting jazz singer ?


85
0:4:48,2 --> 0:4:50,24
No. It's the name
I'm using to sign on.


86
0:4:50,24 --> 0:4:51,72
You want to get off your arse


87
0:4:51,72 --> 0:4:54,84
and get a job, Dizzy,
or whatever your name isn't.


88
0:4:54,84 --> 0:4:57,64
- Nice hair, by the way.
- There you go, mate.


89
0:4:57,64 --> 0:5:0,8
- Cheers.
- My livelihood is in here.


90
0:5:0,8 --> 0:5:3,32
- Guard it with your life.
- As ever. You out this weekend ?


91
0:5:3,32 --> 0:5:7,0
I'm a bit strapped for cash actually.
Lend me 20 quid ?


92
0:5:7,0 --> 0:5:10,56
- Yeah, sure.
- Great.


93
0:5:10,56 --> 0:5:11,84
What's that noise ?


94
0:5:11,84 --> 0:5:13,68
Um...


95
0:5:13,68 --> 0:5:24,8
- We don't know.
- I like it.


96
0:5:24,8 --> 0:5:27,56
You better get off.
That's got to be there by 11.


97
0:5:27,56 --> 0:5:30,48
Right, sir. I've got a good
feeling about this parcel.


98
0:5:30,48 --> 0:5:32,92
Hopefully things
might start going my way.


99
0:5:32,92 --> 0:5:36,0
You know what it's like.
Door, please, Timmy.


100
0:5:36,0 --> 0:5:40,36
Right.


101
0:5:40,36 --> 0:5:43,48
That was close.
He nearly went disco.


102
0:5:43,48 --> 0:5:45,44
What is that noise ?


103
0:5:45,44 --> 0:5:47,2
I don't know. I'm gonna find out.


104
0:5:47,2 --> 0:5:50,32
- Can you tell Mike I need him ?
- What for ?


105
0:5:50,32 --> 0:5:54,6
No reason, I just... need him.


106
0:5:54,6 --> 0:5:58,16
'Can you feel it
in your butt ? That's good.'


107
0:5:58,16 --> 0:5:59,52
Marsha ?


108
0:5:59,52 --> 0:6:1,16
Come in, kitten. It's open.


109
0:6:1,16 --> 0:6:3,12
'... two, turn, one... '


110
0:6:3,12 --> 0:6:5,28
- Morning, Daisy.
- Hi, Mike.


111
0:6:5,28 --> 0:6:7,32
- Nice outfit.
- Thanks.


112
0:6:7,32 --> 0:6:9,64
- Tim wants you.
- Wants me or needs me ?


113
0:6:9,64 --> 0:6:11,8
Needs you.


114
0:6:11,8 --> 0:6:14,88
Right. Ladies.


115
0:6:14,88 --> 0:6:16,4
So what you up to, Marsha ?


116
0:6:16,4 --> 0:6:20,84
It's Cher's new fitness video.
Thong for Europe.


117
0:6:20,84 --> 0:6:23,6
Mike reckons I got
between 15 and 20 years


118
0:6:23,6 --> 0:6:27,32
to find hubby number three
and I want to look my best.


119
0:6:27,32 --> 0:6:29,28
Why don't you come
for a jog with me ?


120
0:6:29,28 --> 0:6:31,36
Oh, no. No.


121
0:6:31,36 --> 0:6:33,4
Come on. It'll be fun.


122
0:6:33,4 --> 0:6:36,56
Get off your ass.
Get the adrenaline pumpin'.


123
0:6:36,56 --> 0:6:38,8
No, I shouldn't do sport
of any kind.


124
0:6:38,8 --> 0:6:42,72
I'm actually allergic to endorphins.
I get very competitive.


125
0:6:42,72 --> 0:6:45,28
Anyway, who wants
to look like these people ?


126
0:6:45,28 --> 0:6:49,24
Go to the gym all day, go to
some premiere in a low-cut dress


127
0:6:49,24 --> 0:6:51,28
to get on the cover
of some magazine.


128
0:6:51,28 --> 0:6:53,2
What kind of a life is that ?


129
0:6:53,2 --> 0:6:56,4
I'm happy right where I am.


130
0:6:56,4 --> 0:6:59,12
- Where is it ?
- Where's what ?


131
0:6:59,12 --> 0:7:1,48
There was a picture
of a man with a white eye


132
0:7:1,48 --> 0:7:3,24
saying "I am a massive wanker."


133
0:7:3,24 --> 0:7:5,6
And if you put it
in my portfolio I cannot begin


134
0:7:5,6 --> 0:7:7,76
to describe the damage
you may have done.


135
0:7:7,76 --> 0:7:9,16
Well, I...


136
0:7:9,16 --> 0:7:12,12
We want this to be easy.
You're amongst friends.


137
0:7:12,12 --> 0:7:13,64
- I just...
- What ?


138
0:7:13,64 --> 0:7:16,76
- What you done with it ?
- Did you put it in my portfolio ?


139
0:7:16,76 --> 0:7:18,92
I put it in A portfolio.


140
0:7:18,92 --> 0:7:20,4
What ? !


141
0:7:20,4 --> 0:7:22,24
I put it in your portfolio.


142
0:7:22,24 --> 0:7:23,44
What ? !


143
0:7:23,44 --> 0:7:24,88
Did she say what I think ?


144
0:7:24,88 --> 0:7:27,4
- She put it in my portfolio.
- What ? !


145
0:7:27,4 --> 0:7:29,92
I thought you'd forgotten it.
I was trying to help.


146
0:7:29,92 --> 0:7:32,48
That was a picture of a man
who is about to decide


147
0:7:32,48 --> 0:7:34,4
whether I work for Darkstar Comix.


148
0:7:34,4 --> 0:7:36,8
You see why I left it out ?


149
0:7:36,8 --> 0:7:39,32
Yes ! Yes, yes. And I'm sorry.
I was just trying to help.


150
0:7:39,32 --> 0:7:42,84
Don't ! If you're going to help,
get off your ass and help yourself.


151
0:7:42,84 --> 0:7:44,92
Why is everyone
talking about my ass ?


152
0:7:44,92 --> 0:7:48,44
Mike. We've got
to try and stop Tyres.


153
0:7:48,44 --> 0:7:49,84
Don't worry, Daisy.


154
0:7:49,84 --> 0:7:51,84
Tim's just really angry at you


155
0:7:51,84 --> 0:7:55,32
because you've jeopardised
his future, Ok ?


156
0:7:55,32 --> 0:7:58,24
I was just trying to help.


157
0:7:58,24 --> 0:8:0,56
God.


158
0:8:0,56 --> 0:8:2,2
Ow, ow, ow.


159
0:8:2,2 --> 0:8:4,32
- All right, Kitten ?
- Yes !


160
0:8:4,32 --> 0:8:6,24
Sure you don't want
to come for a jog ?


161
0:8:6,24 --> 0:8:8,44
- Yes.
- You got work to do ?


162
0:8:8,44 --> 0:8:10,92
No.


163
0:8:10,92 --> 0:8:12,48
What you gonna do, then ?


164
0:8:12,48 --> 0:8:15,44
Sit around the house waiting
for Tim to come home ?


165
0:8:15,44 --> 0:8:25,0
I'll get my plimsolls.


166
0:8:25,0 --> 0:8:29,76
Is Brian there ?


167
0:8:29,76 --> 0:8:31,44
Why are you dressed like that ?


168
0:8:31,44 --> 0:8:33,56
Thought you might like
to come for a run.


169
0:8:33,56 --> 0:8:36,2
Might ease your frustration.


170
0:8:36,2 --> 0:8:38,36
What frustration ?


171
0:8:38,36 --> 0:8:42,2
Why ? I like going out !
I want to stay in.


172
0:8:42,2 --> 0:8:45,12
And have sex ?
That's all you ever want.


173
0:8:45,12 --> 0:8:48,0
I'm not here for one thing.
I want you to see me as a whole.


174
0:8:48,0 --> 0:8:51,88
- I do.
- Whole with a "w".


175
0:8:51,88 --> 0:8:55,52
Just thought you might like a jog.


176
0:8:55,52 --> 0:8:58,64
No, can't. Mum's coming,
we're going out for lunch.


177
0:8:58,64 --> 0:9:0,96
Is that why you're
dressed like that ?


178
0:9:0,96 --> 0:9:3,32
She thinks I'm a lawyer.


179
0:9:3,32 --> 0:9:4,84
Bloody 'ell.


180
0:9:4,84 --> 0:9:8,52
I thought I knew
all your little secrets.


181
0:9:8,52 --> 0:9:11,76
No wonder you're so tense.


182
0:9:11,76 --> 0:9:14,0
Come on !


183
0:9:14,0 --> 0:9:15,64
Come on !


184
0:9:15,64 --> 0:9:17,2
What is the hold-up ?


185
0:9:17,2 --> 0:9:19,64
There's been an accident.


186
0:9:19,64 --> 0:9:21,48
Somebody got hurt.


187
0:9:21,48 --> 0:9:26,8
- Who ?
- A lady.


188
0:9:26,8 --> 0:9:29,28
- How d'you know ?
- Because we hit her.


189
0:9:29,28 --> 0:9:31,68
- Did we ?
- Yeah. That's her there.


190
0:9:31,68 --> 0:9:34,0
- Ah !
- What the hell are you doing ?


191
0:9:34,0 --> 0:9:35,32
It's broad daylight !


192
0:9:35,32 --> 0:9:39,64
You have no consideration
for cyclists.


193
0:9:39,64 --> 0:9:41,0
Pardon ?


194
0:9:41,0 --> 0:9:43,48
What the hell are you doing ?
It's broad daylight.


195
0:9:43,48 --> 0:9:45,28
You have no consideration
for cyclists.


196
0:9:45,28 --> 0:9:52,16
All right.
What's your problem ?


197
0:9:52,16 --> 0:9:53,44
- You all right ?
- Yeah.


198
0:9:53,44 --> 0:10:10,84
- Think you can go on ? Come on.
- Yeah.


199
0:10:10,84 --> 0:10:13,36
Yeah. Yeah, sure.


200
0:10:13,36 --> 0:10:15,32
Sure.


201
0:10:15,32 --> 0:10:17,12
That's not gonna happen


202
0:10:17,12 --> 0:10:19,24
cos he's a small fish
in a big pond


203
0:10:19,24 --> 0:10:21,2
and I'm a big... shark !


204
0:10:21,2 --> 0:10:24,72
Yes, yes. OK. Bye.


205
0:10:24,72 --> 0:10:26,0
Hi, Mum.


206
0:10:26,0 --> 0:10:27,96
- Hello, love.
- Shall we go ?


207
0:10:27,96 --> 0:10:29,44
Aren't we going in ?


208
0:10:29,44 --> 0:10:32,44
No, I've got the builders in.
They're making a wall.


209
0:10:32,44 --> 0:10:36,68
I know a good place to eat.


210
0:10:36,68 --> 0:10:38,28
This is all right.


211
0:10:38,28 --> 0:10:55,28
- What did I tell you ?
- It's quite fun.


212
0:10:55,28 --> 0:10:56,4
Shit, there he is.


213
0:10:56,4 --> 0:11:16,96
Tyres !


214
0:11:16,96 --> 0:11:18,16
What about you ?


215
0:11:18,16 --> 0:11:20,88
- Don't deliver that parcel.
- Why ?


216
0:11:20,88 --> 0:11:23,28
There's something
I don't want them to see.


217
0:11:23,28 --> 0:11:24,72
Paperclips ?


218
0:11:24,72 --> 0:11:26,36
No. Where's my portfolio ?


219
0:11:26,36 --> 0:11:28,64
I delivered that half an hour ago.


220
0:11:28,64 --> 0:11:32,48
Noooooooooooooooo !


221
0:11:32,48 --> 0:11:33,8
Did you get it ?


222
0:11:33,8 --> 0:11:37,44
- Nice outfit.
- Thanks.


223
0:11:37,44 --> 0:11:40,36
Tim Bisley's portfolio
has arrived.


224
0:11:40,36 --> 0:11:42,2
Right.


225
0:11:42,2 --> 0:11:55,92
Actually, I'll look
at it after lunch.


226
0:11:55,92 --> 0:11:57,4
Couldn't we go get it ?


227
0:11:57,4 --> 0:11:59,56
Not even I can get
to the upper reaches.


228
0:11:59,56 --> 0:12:2,88
Parcels are left at reception
and collected by personnel.


229
0:12:2,88 --> 0:12:5,24
- Damn.
- They must let some people up.


230
0:12:5,24 --> 0:12:7,28
- Not without an appointment.
- Shit.


231
0:12:7,28 --> 0:12:19,96
How am I gonna get my
picture back ? Mike, any ideas ?


232
0:12:19,96 --> 0:12:21,24
Tyres ?


233
0:12:21,24 --> 0:12:24,88
Yeah, but we'll need
another walkie-talkie.


234
0:12:24,88 --> 0:12:29,16
- Or two.


235
0:12:29,16 --> 0:12:33,48
Can I have a large half-caff
frappuccino, please ?


236
0:12:33,48 --> 0:12:37,64
With whipped cream
and marshmallow dunkers... Mum ?


237
0:12:37,64 --> 0:12:41,84
Yes. I'll have one of those, too.


238
0:12:41,84 --> 0:12:43,24
When in Rome.


239
0:12:43,24 --> 0:12:47,6
- So how is everything ?
- Good.


240
0:12:47,6 --> 0:12:50,32
- How's Twist ?
- Good. 0ut of town.


241
0:12:50,32 --> 0:12:51,6
Can't wait to meet her.


242
0:12:51,6 --> 0:12:53,0
Very busy.


243
0:12:53,0 --> 0:12:55,96
Well, fashion is big business
these days, Brian.


244
0:12:55,96 --> 0:13:3,56
You know that.


245
0:13:3,56 --> 0:13:5,68
Oh, are they friends of yours ?


246
0:13:5,68 --> 0:13:13,0
Never seen them before.


247
0:13:13,0 --> 0:13:17,44
- Brian, what is it ?
- Sorry ?


248
0:13:17,44 --> 0:13:19,68
- What is it ?
- It's me again.


249
0:13:19,68 --> 0:13:22,16
- I can see that.
- Third time today.


250
0:13:22,16 --> 0:13:24,44
Have you got something to deliver ?


251
0:13:24,44 --> 0:13:26,32
I was thinking, I'm getting a bit


252
0:13:26,32 --> 0:13:28,48
long in the tooth
with this cycling lark.


253
0:13:28,48 --> 0:13:30,92
The old pins ain't
what they used to be.


254
0:13:30,92 --> 0:13:32,52
What's your point ?


255
0:13:32,52 --> 0:13:35,96
I was wondering what it's like
to be a security guard.


256
0:13:35,96 --> 0:13:38,4
I really look up to people like you.


257
0:13:38,4 --> 0:13:39,64
Do you ?


258
0:13:39,64 --> 0:13:41,52
Yeah. How'd I get to be like you ?


259
0:13:41,52 --> 0:13:45,2
Well, tell you what,
give us your name and address,


260
0:13:45,2 --> 0:13:47,32
and I'll send you
all you need to apply.


261
0:13:47,32 --> 0:13:50,2
- Would you ?
- Sure. Why not ?


262
0:13:50,2 --> 0:13:53,36
Brilliant. All right.
My name's Henry Krinkle.


263
0:13:53,36 --> 0:13:55,88
K-r-i-n-k-l-e.


264
0:13:55,88 --> 0:13:57,72
154, Hopper Avenue.


265
0:13:57,72 --> 0:14:3,36
- Hopper ?
- Yeah, Hopper.


266
0:14:3,36 --> 0:14:9,56
Ow. Ow.


267
0:14:9,56 --> 0:14:12,8
Colin ! Stop her.


268
0:14:12,8 --> 0:14:15,8
Who does he think he is ?
Bob bloody Kane ?


269
0:14:15,8 --> 0:14:21,36
Tell him I'd make more money
pimping his grandmother.


270
0:14:21,36 --> 0:14:22,76
How's Dad ?


271
0:14:22,76 --> 0:14:26,84
Oh, you know him. Frustrated as ever.
He's taken up art classes.


272
0:14:26,84 --> 0:14:28,88
- What ?
- Yes.


273
0:14:28,88 --> 0:14:31,68
I think he'd always fancied
himself as an artist.


274
0:14:31,68 --> 0:14:33,24
He keeps it to himself.


275
0:14:33,24 --> 0:14:36,12
We always hoped you might
go in for that sort of thing.


276
0:14:36,12 --> 0:14:37,92
You were so good at it at school.


277
0:14:37,92 --> 0:14:41,4
It might have given you something
to talk about with your father.


278
0:14:41,4 --> 0:14:47,44
- Mum.
- What, love ?


279
0:14:47,44 --> 0:14:49,16
Something I should tell you.


280
0:14:49,16 --> 0:14:51,76
What is it ?


281
0:14:51,76 --> 0:14:54,4
This is it. Fourth floor.


282
0:14:54,4 --> 0:14:56,76
- You ready ?
- I was born ready.


283
0:14:56,76 --> 0:14:58,6
- But are you ready now ?
- Yeah.


284
0:14:58,6 --> 0:15:1,76
We've only got to get the
picture back and not get caught.


285
0:15:1,76 --> 0:15:4,88
How hard can that be ?


286
0:15:4,88 --> 0:15:6,76
Tell Stan I'll speak to him later.


287
0:15:6,76 --> 0:15:18,52
After I've put Bisley
out of his misery.


288
0:15:18,52 --> 0:15:20,4
There it is.


289
0:15:20,4 --> 0:15:22,28
- Shit.
- Is it locked ?


290
0:15:22,28 --> 0:15:24,64
No, I was joking.


291
0:15:24,64 --> 0:15:28,84
- What are we gonna do ?
- Er... there.


292
0:15:28,84 --> 0:15:30,76
- What ?
- Ventilation shaft.


293
0:15:30,76 --> 0:15:33,6
Simple and classic.


294
0:15:33,6 --> 0:15:36,24
Oh.


295
0:15:36,24 --> 0:15:38,92
- I can't believe this.
- I'm sorry.


296
0:15:38,92 --> 0:15:42,2
- Why ?
- I thought you'd be disappointed.


297
0:15:42,2 --> 0:15:45,4
That's so silly.
We don't mind what you do,


298
0:15:45,4 --> 0:15:46,72
so long as you're not gay.


299
0:15:46,72 --> 0:15:48,44
I bet you made up Twist, as well.


300
0:15:48,44 --> 0:15:51,48
I should've known.
What sort of a name is Twist ?


301
0:15:51,48 --> 0:15:55,16
- No, she's real.
- Well, that's something.


302
0:15:55,16 --> 0:15:58,68
- So, you're an artist.
- Yep.


303
0:15:58,68 --> 0:16:0,88
What sort of thing do you do ?


304
0:16:0,88 --> 0:16:2,48
Um, anger.


305
0:16:2,48 --> 0:16:7,12
Aaaaaaaah !


306
0:16:7,12 --> 0:16:8,76
Pain.


307
0:16:8,76 --> 0:16:9,92
Ow !


308
0:16:9,92 --> 0:16:14,0
Fear.


309
0:16:14,0 --> 0:16:18,32
Aggression.


310
0:16:18,32 --> 0:16:21,28
Watercolours ?


311
0:16:21,28 --> 0:16:22,56
Do you go clubbing much ?


312
0:16:22,56 --> 0:16:24,64
No, do a lot of night work.


313
0:16:24,64 --> 0:16:27,36
I love night work.
I'm usually up all hours.


314
0:16:27,36 --> 0:16:38,0
- Speeding through the night ?
- Something like that.


315
0:16:38,0 --> 0:16:39,2
Ok, stay out of sight.


316
0:16:39,2 --> 0:16:41,32
If anybody comes,
warn me on the walkie.


317
0:16:41,32 --> 0:17:4,96
- Roger.
- Let's go.


318
0:17:4,96 --> 0:17:8,8
- How's your knee ?
- I'll live.


319
0:17:8,8 --> 0:17:10,72
My teeth hurt.


320
0:17:10,72 --> 0:17:13,52
I wish I hadn't started this now.


321
0:17:13,52 --> 0:17:18,36
I'm sorry, Marsha,
but I did warn you.


322
0:17:18,36 --> 0:17:21,28
It was the same with netball.


323
0:17:21,28 --> 0:17:24,48
At school.


324
0:17:24,48 --> 0:17:27,6
'I remember playing a friendly
in the upper sixth.


325
0:17:27,6 --> 0:17:30,8
'I played goal attack.


326
0:17:30,8 --> 0:17:33,16
'And I had a wee rivalry with
the goalie on the other team.


327
0:17:33,16 --> 0:17:35,72
'She was called Nina.


328
0:17:35,72 --> 0:17:38,4
'I remember the goal shooter
took a shot


329
0:17:38,4 --> 0:17:40,84
'and it was obvious
Nina was gonna save.


330
0:17:40,84 --> 0:17:43,4
'So I did what I had to do.


331
0:17:43,4 --> 0:17:46,96
'I saved the game.


332
0:17:46,96 --> 0:17:50,76
'But I lost a lot of friends.'


333
0:17:50,76 --> 0:17:53,8
I just shouldn't exercise.


334
0:17:53,8 --> 0:17:56,48
It's not just bad for me,
it's bad for everybody.


335
0:17:56,48 --> 0:18:4,68
I don't know.
I'm really feeling the benefit now.


336
0:18:4,68 --> 0:18:6,56
Come on, let's fuck off home.


337
0:18:6,56 --> 0:18:10,72
Hmm. I wonder if Tim's back.


338
0:18:10,72 --> 0:18:17,36
What's Colin looking at ?


339
0:18:17,36 --> 0:18:21,76
Where's he off to ?


340
0:18:21,76 --> 0:18:23,52
Oh, my God !


341
0:18:23,52 --> 0:18:27,32
So, when did you decide
to become an artist ?


342
0:18:27,32 --> 0:18:29,84
I think it was,
you know, when the dog died.


343
0:18:29,84 --> 0:18:32,52
Oh, you never did get over that.


344
0:18:32,52 --> 0:18:33,72
Colin !


345
0:18:33,72 --> 0:18:49,48
Colin !


346
0:18:49,48 --> 0:18:54,32
Pom-Pom !


347
0:18:54,32 --> 0:18:55,84
Not again.


348
0:18:55,84 --> 0:19:3,24
Colin !


349
0:19:3,24 --> 0:19:14,84
Daisy !


350
0:19:14,84 --> 0:19:17,4
What the hell do you think
you're doing ?


351
0:19:17,4 --> 0:19:19,88
Ooh, um. Well.


352
0:19:19,88 --> 0:19:24,92
- I... was just...
- Looking for this ?


353
0:19:24,92 --> 0:19:27,4
Yes. Yeah, um...


354
0:19:27,4 --> 0:19:29,28
I had to get it back, you see.


355
0:19:29,28 --> 0:19:33,48
I mean if Mr Knox saw it, then...


356
0:19:33,48 --> 0:19:35,6
It wouldn't really
do you any favours ?


357
0:19:35,6 --> 0:19:37,2
No, no, no.


358
0:19:37,2 --> 0:19:40,16
No, um.


359
0:19:40,16 --> 0:19:41,44
How are you, Sophie ?


360
0:19:41,44 --> 0:19:42,8
Fine, thanks.


361
0:19:42,8 --> 0:19:45,24
Good, good.


362
0:19:45,24 --> 0:19:47,44
I forgot you worked here.


363
0:19:47,44 --> 0:19:50,6
Really ?


364
0:19:50,6 --> 0:19:56,12
'Tim, that girl you fancy's
coming into the office.'


365
0:19:56,12 --> 0:20:0,72
Thanks, Mike.


366
0:20:0,72 --> 0:20:2,68
How's Damien ?


367
0:20:2,68 --> 0:20:5,92
I'm sorry. You just
ran out in front of me.


368
0:20:5,92 --> 0:20:9,64
I know you.
You're a massive wanker.


369
0:20:9,64 --> 0:20:11,4
I said I was sorry.


370
0:20:11,4 --> 0:20:14,64
I've had enough of keeping fit.
It's too bloody dangerous.


371
0:20:14,64 --> 0:20:18,56
If people throw themselves
in front of cars, what do you expect ?


372
0:20:18,56 --> 0:20:20,32
She could sue you.


373
0:20:20,32 --> 0:20:22,8
For what ?


374
0:20:22,8 --> 0:20:23,28
Dangerous driving.


375
0:20:23,28 --> 0:20:25,84
Bloody hell, you're not a lawyer ?


376
0:20:25,84 --> 0:20:30,88
No, he's an artist.


377
0:20:30,88 --> 0:20:34,8
- Here's your picture.
- Thanks.


378
0:20:34,8 --> 0:20:36,88
I think I'll keep this one.


379
0:20:36,88 --> 0:20:39,72
Yeah, fine.


380
0:20:39,72 --> 0:20:41,64
It was nice to see you again, Tim.


381
0:20:41,64 --> 0:20:46,4
You're nice, too.
It was nice to see you, too.


382
0:20:46,4 --> 0:20:48,2
- Tim.
- Yes.


383
0:20:48,2 --> 0:20:50,64
- What are you doing on Friday ?
- What ?


384
0:20:50,64 --> 0:20:54,4
Would you like to go out for a drink
with me on Friday ?


385
0:20:54,4 --> 0:20:57,28
Yeah.


386
0:20:57,28 --> 0:20:59,92
Great. I'll give you a ring.


387
0:20:59,92 --> 0:21:1,72
OK.


388
0:21:1,72 --> 0:21:12,88
- See you Friday.
- See you Friday.


389
0:21:12,88 --> 0:21:14,4
You get it ?


390
0:21:14,4 --> 0:21:16,0
That's not all I got.


391
0:21:16,0 --> 0:21:20,6
Leave the coffee !


392
0:21:20,6 --> 0:21:22,24
No, never been to Ibiza.


393
0:21:22,24 --> 0:21:23,96
You should go, mate.


394
0:21:23,96 --> 0:21:29,2
Went to Gran Canaria.
I got some pictures, actually.


395
0:21:29,2 --> 0:21:33,56
- What the...
- The cat is out of the bag.


396
0:21:33,56 --> 0:21:35,6
'Repeat,
the cat is out of the bag.'


397
0:21:35,6 --> 0:21:41,68
Shit.


398
0:21:41,68 --> 0:21:44,64
He's taking the stairs,
get the lift.


399
0:21:44,64 --> 0:21:47,24
'He's taking the stairs,
get the lift ! '


400
0:21:47,24 --> 0:22:17,28
Shit.


401
0:22:17,28 --> 0:22:18,88
Bisley.


402
0:22:18,88 --> 0:22:20,76
Hi.


403
0:22:20,76 --> 0:22:24,92
Well now. You're keen, aren't you ?


404
0:22:24,92 --> 0:22:29,0
Haven't had a chance to look
over your stuff yet.


405
0:22:29,0 --> 0:22:33,28
Oh, that's all right.


406
0:22:33,28 --> 0:22:35,96
- Everything all right, Willis ?
- Sorry, sir.


407
0:22:35,96 --> 0:22:38,64
Thought I saw unauthorised
personnel on the monitor.


408
0:22:38,64 --> 0:22:42,36
I haven't seen anybody.


409
0:22:42,36 --> 0:22:44,48
I'll get back to me desk, then.


410
0:22:44,48 --> 0:22:45,72
- Hello, Mike.
- Hello.


411
0:22:45,72 --> 0:22:47,88
- What are you doing here ?
- I'm with Tim.


412
0:22:47,88 --> 0:22:49,76
Right. You coming to TA Saturday ?


413
0:22:49,76 --> 0:22:53,2
Oh, yes. Stealth and tactics
weekend. I wouldn't miss it.


414
0:22:53,2 --> 0:22:56,24
I've an idea for an
infiltration technique.


415
0:22:56,24 --> 0:22:59,2
It involves draining a man's
blood, replacing it with Tizer.


416
0:22:59,2 --> 0:23:1,6
Sounds great.
Look forward to that.


417
0:23:1,6 --> 0:23:3,4
- See you Saturday.
- Yeah.


418
0:23:3,4 --> 0:23:4,56
Sir.


419
0:23:4,56 --> 0:23:7,2
Yes, right.


420
0:23:7,2 --> 0:23:10,8
Good to see you looking
so enthusiastic, Bisley.


421
0:23:10,8 --> 0:23:13,8
I'll let you know either way.


422
0:23:13,8 --> 0:23:15,52
Thanks, Mr Knox.


423
0:23:15,52 --> 0:23:22,96
- Damien.
- Thanks, Damien.


424
0:23:22,96 --> 0:23:25,36
- Nice outfit.
- Oh, thanks.


425
0:23:25,36 --> 0:23:29,4
He's nice, isn't he ?


426
0:23:29,4 --> 0:23:30,48
So, we happy ?


427
0:23:30,48 --> 0:23:31,68
Are we happy.


428
0:23:31,68 --> 0:23:34,0
Right, mine's a pint
of the black stuff.


429
0:23:34,0 --> 0:23:39,36
You can't drink
a pint of Bovril.


430
0:23:39,36 --> 0:23:40,76
What do you think ?


431
0:23:40,76 --> 0:23:44,8
Very good. Very good indeed.


432
0:23:44,8 --> 0:23:47,12
Schedule him in
for a meeting next Tuesday.


433
0:23:47,12 --> 0:23:57,52
I think we're going to be seeing
a lot of young Mr Bisley.


434
0:23:57,52 --> 0:24:0,52
- Oi oi.
- Oh. Hello.


435
0:24:0,52 --> 0:24:2,44
Hi. Listen, I got that picture back.


436
0:24:2,44 --> 0:24:4,6
- That's not all he got.
- Mike.


437
0:24:4,6 --> 0:24:6,8
- I got off me ass.
- Did you ?


438
0:24:6,8 --> 0:24:7,36
- Yeah.
- What happened ?


439
0:24:7,36 --> 0:24:9,0
I bumped into a friend of yours.


440
0:24:9,0 --> 0:24:11,4
Really ? Why don't you
tell me all about it ?


441
0:24:11,4 --> 0:24:15,4
- My ass ?
- Yeah, if you like.


442
0:24:15,4 --> 0:26:15,4
Where's Tyres ?
