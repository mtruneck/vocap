STEVE SPANGLER: Dit,
da, dit, da, dit.


3
0:0:1,46 --> 0:0:2,25
What are you doing, Barbie?


4
0:0:2,25 --> 0:0:2,403
BARBIE: [MOCK FEMALE VOICE]


5
0:0:2,403 --> 0:0:4,525
Oh, I'm just going to get
ready to do pushups.


6
0:0:4,525 --> 0:0:7,5
STEVE SPANGLER: Well, no time
for pushups today, Barbie,


7
0:0:7,5 --> 0:0:8,615
because today you're
doing science.


8
0:0:8,615 --> 0:0:9,43
BARBIE: [MOCK FEMALE VOICE]


9
0:0:9,43 --> 0:0:10,44
No, I don't want to.


10
0:0:10,44 --> 0:0:10,738
STEVE SPANGLER: Yes, you do.


11
0:0:10,738 --> 0:0:12,29
You're smart, and you
like science.


12
0:0:12,29 --> 0:0:13,15
And I got your favorite


13
0:0:13,15 --> 0:0:15,73
demonstration, the bed of nails.


14
0:0:15,73 --> 0:0:16,69
BARBIE: [MOCK FEMALE VOICE]


15
0:0:16,69 --> 0:0:18,166
No, not the bed of nails.


16
0:0:18,166 --> 0:0:19,72
STEVE SPANGLER: No, you
really like it.


17
0:0:19,72 --> 0:0:20,4
Watch this.


18
0:0:20,4 --> 0:0:21,69
No, don't lay down that way.


19
0:0:21,69 --> 0:0:22,47
That'll hurt you.


20
0:0:22,47 --> 0:0:23,73
So you have to lay
down this way.


21
0:0:23,73 --> 0:0:24,14
Ready?


22
0:0:24,14 --> 0:0:24,944
BARBIE: [MOCK FEMALE VOICE]


23
0:0:24,944 --> 0:0:25,75
Ohh.


24
0:0:25,75 --> 0:0:26,7
STEVE SPANGLER: No.


25
0:0:26,7 --> 0:0:28,3
It didn't really hurt because
the pressure is distributed


26
0:0:28,3 --> 0:0:29,15
all over your back.


27
0:0:29,15 --> 0:0:29,94
BARBIE: [MOCK FEMALE VOICE]


28
0:0:29,94 --> 0:0:30,64
No, that's a lie.


29
0:0:30,64 --> 0:0:30,86
It totally hurt.


30
0:0:30,86 --> 0:0:31,75
STEVE SPANGLER: No.


31
0:0:31,75 --> 0:0:35,36
It'll be fine because I have
a new thing for you to do.


32
0:0:35,36 --> 0:0:36,95
Watch this, Barbie.


33
0:0:36,95 --> 0:0:38,45
You're going to love this.


34
0:0:38,45 --> 0:0:40,19
It's the Barbie bowling ball.


35
0:0:40,19 --> 0:0:41,126
BARBIE: [MOCK FEMALE VOICE]


36
0:0:41,126 --> 0:0:42,53
No, not the Barbie
bowling ball.


37
0:0:42,53 --> 0:0:43,23
STEVE SPANGLER: Yes.


38
0:0:43,23 --> 0:0:44,3
It's only 10 pounds.


39
0:0:44,3 --> 0:0:46,54
But dropped from here, it's not
going to hurt you at all.


40
0:0:46,54 --> 0:0:46,865
Watch.


41
0:0:46,865 --> 0:0:49,6
[BOOM BOOM]


42
0:0:49,6 --> 0:0:49,835
STEVE SPANGLER: Oopsie.

0:0:49,835 --> 0:0:51,575
[MUSIC PLAYING]


44
0:0:51,575 --> 0:0:54,7
STEVE SPANGLER: I'm Steve
Spangler, and I'm all about


45
0:0:54,7 --> 0:0:55,13
making science fun.


46
0:0:55,13 --> 0:0:58,12
For the last 20 years, I've
been teaching ways to turn


47
0:0:58,12 --> 0:1:1,13
ordinary science experiments
into unforgettable learning


48
0:1:1,13 --> 0:1:2,14
experiences.


49
0:1:2,14 --> 0:1:4,78
I have an amazing team who will
do whatever it takes to


50
0:1:4,78 --> 0:1:6,94
affect the way people
think about science.


51
0:1:6,94 --> 0:1:11,22
And to do that, I live by one
motto, make it big, do it


52
0:1:11,22 --> 0:1:12,805
right, give it class.


53
0:1:12,805 --> 0:1:17,84
[MUSIC PLAYING]


54
0:1:17,84 --> 0:1:18,91
STEVE SPANGLER: You
guessed it.


55
0:1:18,91 --> 0:1:21,95
Today is all about bed of
nails and pressure.


56
0:1:21,95 --> 0:1:23,49
I'm going to show you all the
secrets of the bed of nails--


57
0:1:23,49 --> 0:1:25,52
how they crush the cinder block,
how you can make your


58
0:1:25,52 --> 0:1:29,25
own bed of nails at home, and
how we use the coolest bed of


59
0:1:29,25 --> 0:1:31,78
nails I've ever seen on
over 700 teachers in


60
0:1:31,78 --> 0:1:33,17
less than 24 hours.


61
0:1:33,17 --> 0:1:34,96
So if you're going to make your
own bed of nails, you're


62
0:1:34,96 --> 0:1:37,97
going to need some nails.


63
0:1:37,97 --> 0:1:40,28
We wanted good-looking nails
here for our bed of nails.


64
0:1:40,28 --> 0:1:43,39
And we have 98 of them to be
exact to correspond with the


65
0:1:43,39 --> 0:1:46,85
98 holes that are in the board
that you see right here.


66
0:1:46,85 --> 0:1:48,57
Now we have this as a kit.


67
0:1:48,57 --> 0:1:50,27
It's like a CNC machine
did this.


68
0:1:50,27 --> 0:1:51,68
It's spaced out perfectly.


69
0:1:51,68 --> 0:1:54,43
But you could easily make
this in the shop as a


70
0:1:54,43 --> 0:1:55,47
simple little project.


71
0:1:55,47 --> 0:1:58,94
But before you load up the thing
with all of the nails,


72
0:1:58,94 --> 0:2:2,768
try just one.


73
0:2:2,768 --> 0:2:5,11
See here's what makes this
demonstration cool--


74
0:2:5,11 --> 0:2:8,31
is if you start with just one
nail get to see the effect of


75
0:2:8,31 --> 0:2:11,74
all of that pressure, the
amount of force per a


76
0:2:11,74 --> 0:2:14,48
particular, area exerted
on this balloon.


77
0:2:14,48 --> 0:2:17,13
And all the pressure as I push
down will be exerted on the


78
0:2:17,13 --> 0:2:18,22
tip of that nail.


79
0:2:18,22 --> 0:2:18,865
What happens.


80
0:2:18,865 --> 0:2:20,72
[POP]


81
0:2:20,72 --> 0:2:21,28
STEVE SPANGLER: No surprise.


82
0:2:21,28 --> 0:2:24,29
It pops because all of that
pressure was on just a small


83
0:2:24,29 --> 0:2:25,5
amount of that balloon.


84
0:2:25,5 --> 0:2:26,91
What if we try two nails?


85
0:2:26,91 --> 0:2:28,8
Watch this.


86
0:2:28,8 --> 0:2:29,9
[POP]


87
0:2:29,9 --> 0:2:30,435
STEVE SPANGLER: It still pops.


88
0:2:30,435 --> 0:2:32,635
But I got to push a little
bit more than I do


89
0:2:32,635 --> 0:2:33,23
on the first one.


90
0:2:33,23 --> 0:2:35,31
What if we do four nails?


91
0:2:35,31 --> 0:2:37,68
See, every time I add a
nail, it looks worse.


92
0:2:37,68 --> 0:2:39,55
But in fact I'm just spreading
that weight out


93
0:2:39,55 --> 0:2:42,724
over a bigger area.


94
0:2:42,724 --> 0:2:43,162
[POP]


95
0:2:43,162 --> 0:2:45,53
STEVE SPANGLER: And I
had to push harder.


96
0:2:45,53 --> 0:2:46,275
You guessed it.


97
0:2:46,275 --> 0:2:47,826
It's time for 98 nails.


98
0:2:47,826 --> 0:2:49,45
Go.


99
0:2:49,45 --> 0:2:54,15
[MUSIC PLAYING]


100
0:2:54,15 --> 0:2:56,78
STEVE SPANGLER: Last nail.


101
0:2:56,78 --> 0:2:59,94
Looks good.


102
0:2:59,94 --> 0:3:1,26
Just push down.


103
0:3:1,26 --> 0:3:6,852
[BANG, BANG, BANG]


104
0:3:6,852 --> 0:3:7,705
STEVE SPANGLER: Perfect.


105
0:3:7,705 --> 0:3:9,35
And there's your bed of nails.


106
0:3:9,35 --> 0:3:10,87
See, doesn't this look
so much worse?


107
0:3:10,87 --> 0:3:13,68
98 sharp nails.


108
0:3:13,68 --> 0:3:14,51
It looks bad.


109
0:3:14,51 --> 0:3:17,49
But I'm actually now spreading
that pressure, or that weight,


110
0:3:17,49 --> 0:3:20,975
distributing that pressure
across 98 points instead of


111
0:3:20,975 --> 0:3:23,59
the one or two points that
was there before.


112
0:3:23,59 --> 0:3:26,73
It looks bad, but it's going to
be better for the balloon.


113
0:3:26,73 --> 0:3:29,23
Don't make the mistake of
pushing the balloon down with


114
0:3:29,23 --> 0:3:31,82
your hand as hard as you can
because you can see just a


115
0:3:31,82 --> 0:3:33,71
small amount is perfectly
fine.


116
0:3:33,71 --> 0:3:36,41
But if you push harder, then
this is going to pop, and,


117
0:3:36,41 --> 0:3:38,35
finally you're going to
impale your hands.


118
0:3:38,35 --> 0:3:39,5
Not a good idea.


119
0:3:39,5 --> 0:3:41,73
That's why we have these
guideposts that


120
0:3:41,73 --> 0:3:43,16
go on either side.


121
0:3:43,16 --> 0:3:46,66
And now there's a safety piece
that goes at the top that'll


122
0:3:46,66 --> 0:3:48,31
now protect your hand.


123
0:3:48,31 --> 0:3:50,48
Time for Mr. Balloon to meet
his fate because it


124
0:3:50,48 --> 0:3:52,63
goes down like this.


125
0:3:52,63 --> 0:3:57,68
The safety panel goes on
top here like this.


126
0:3:57,68 --> 0:4:0,73
And now we're ready to go.


127
0:4:0,73 --> 0:4:2,92
You start pushing and watch.


128
0:4:2,92 --> 0:4:5,6
As you get closer and closer and
closer, you can actually


129
0:4:5,6 --> 0:4:8,72
see the tips of the nails
working their


130
0:4:8,72 --> 0:4:10,482
way into the rubber.


131
0:4:10,482 --> 0:4:13,74
A tremendous amount of
pressure goes in.


132
0:4:13,74 --> 0:4:14,91
Look at this.


133
0:4:14,91 --> 0:4:16,965
That's a lot of pressure.


134
0:4:16,965 --> 0:4:19,68
Yet when you pull it back out
again, the balloon is


135
0:4:19,68 --> 0:4:23,61
perfectly fine with small,
little indentations right on


136
0:4:23,61 --> 0:4:25,9
the surface.


137
0:4:25,9 --> 0:4:27,75
This time we use a clear balloon
because this time I


138
0:4:27,75 --> 0:4:31,2
want you to see the nails
actually being forced up and


139
0:4:31,2 --> 0:4:32,34
into the surface
of the balloon.


140
0:4:32,34 --> 0:4:33,59
Watch.


141
0:4:33,59 --> 0:4:34,57
Look right down here.


142
0:4:34,57 --> 0:4:38,9
As I increase the pressure,
look at those nails being


143
0:4:38,9 --> 0:4:40,83
pushed into the balloon.


144
0:4:40,83 --> 0:4:43,42
Again, the secret is
distributing that pressure


145
0:4:43,42 --> 0:4:44,67
over all of the nails.


146
0:4:44,67 --> 0:4:47,22
And that force is being
distributed.


147
0:4:47,22 --> 0:4:49,26
You can put a tremendous
amount of


148
0:4:49,26 --> 0:4:50,51
pressure until finally--


149
0:4:50,51 --> 0:4:53,3



150
0:4:53,3 --> 0:4:53,49
[POP]


151
0:4:53,49 --> 0:4:54,5
STEVE SPANGLER: --it pops.


152
0:4:54,5 --> 0:4:56,435
That's the reason we have
the safety shield.


153
0:4:56,435 --> 0:4:57,94
You want it bigger?


154
0:4:57,94 --> 0:4:59,16
This is bigger.


155
0:4:59,16 --> 0:5:2,825
2,000 nails in our
new bed of nails.


156
0:5:2,825 --> 0:5:3,47
It's bigger.


157
0:5:3,47 --> 0:5:4,28
It's scarier.


158
0:5:4,28 --> 0:5:8,11
But it still works on the same
principle of a distribution of


159
0:5:8,11 --> 0:5:9,545
the weight on all the nails.


160
0:5:9,545 --> 0:5:12,5
And it even passes
the balloon test.


161
0:5:12,5 --> 0:5:13,75
Watch.


162
0:5:13,75 --> 0:5:16,65



163
0:5:16,65 --> 0:5:18,16
You have to always
remember that the


164
0:5:18,16 --> 0:5:20,17
bed of nails is dangerous.


165
0:5:20,17 --> 0:5:22,78
If you just let it sit here on
the floor unattended, somebody


166
0:5:22,78 --> 0:5:23,57
could walk on it.


167
0:5:23,57 --> 0:5:25,19
It can be very, very
dangerous.


168
0:5:25,19 --> 0:5:27,66
And so you need to have
a cover for it.


169
0:5:27,66 --> 0:5:28,91
And that's what these are for.


170
0:5:28,91 --> 0:5:32,96
See, these thin pieces of wood
cover the nails so that nobody


171
0:5:32,96 --> 0:5:35,465
accidentally trips and
falls on it as well.


172
0:5:35,465 --> 0:5:37,55
And now we're ready
for Higgensworth.


173
0:5:37,55 --> 0:5:39,295
Oh, there is one more thing.


174
0:5:39,295 --> 0:5:40,87
We have a little fake blood.


175
0:5:40,87 --> 0:5:41,44
All right.


176
0:5:41,44 --> 0:5:44,24
So just a little fake blood
here like this.


177
0:5:44,24 --> 0:5:46,465
We just throw a little
bit here like this.


178
0:5:46,465 --> 0:5:48,26
Ahh, that's perfect.


179
0:5:48,26 --> 0:5:50,41
We have to have some splatter
marks here.


180
0:5:50,41 --> 0:5:53,81
This will freak him out
when we reveal it.


181
0:5:53,81 --> 0:5:55,29
And we'll say, no, it's OK.


182
0:5:55,29 --> 0:6:0,4
Ever since we fixed the problem,
it's perfectly fine.


183
0:6:0,4 --> 0:6:2,6
Well, ladies and gentlemen, boys
and girls, children of


184
0:6:2,6 --> 0:6:4,307
all ages, it's come to the time
of the show you've all


185
0:6:4,307 --> 0:6:4,76
been waiting for.


186
0:6:4,76 --> 0:6:5,57
That's right.


187
0:6:5,57 --> 0:6:6,95
That's where we do
the bed of nails.


188
0:6:6,95 --> 0:6:10,38
And who better to lay on the
bed of nails than our own--


189
0:6:10,38 --> 0:6:14,32
you know him, you love him, the
master, the dangerous, the


190
0:6:14,32 --> 0:6:17,62
disastrous, it's Higgensworth.


191
0:6:17,62 --> 0:6:20,14
Where is he?


192
0:6:20,14 --> 0:6:22,73
Higgens?


193
0:6:22,73 --> 0:6:23,71
Higgensworth?


194
0:6:23,71 --> 0:6:25,9
I'll get him.


195
0:6:25,9 --> 0:6:26,25
Hey, it's going to be OK.


196
0:6:26,25 --> 0:6:26,69
Come here.


197
0:6:26,69 --> 0:6:27,52
Higgensworth, come here.


198
0:6:27,52 --> 0:6:30,534
HIGGENSWORTH: I'm getting
tired of this [BEEP].


199
0:6:30,534 --> 0:6:32,65
STEVE SPANGLER: So I got
everything worked out, all the


200
0:6:32,65 --> 0:6:33,665
bugs worked out.


201
0:6:33,665 --> 0:6:34,7
This is going to be great.


202
0:6:34,7 --> 0:6:35,69
You're going to like this.


203
0:6:35,69 --> 0:6:36,15
HIGGENSWORTH: I've heard
that before.


204
0:6:36,15 --> 0:6:37,11
STEVE SPANGLER: And when
they see this, they're


205
0:6:37,11 --> 0:6:38,41
going to love you.


206
0:6:38,41 --> 0:6:39,36
Drum roll please.


207
0:6:39,36 --> 0:6:41,23
HIGGENSWORTH: Brrrrrrr.


208
0:6:41,23 --> 0:6:42,204
STEVE SPANGLER: Little
bit more enthusiasm.


209
0:6:42,204 --> 0:6:43,152
HIGGENSWORTH: Brrrrrrrrr.


210
0:6:43,152 --> 0:6:44,574
STEVE SPANGLER: Watch this.


211
0:6:44,574 --> 0:6:46,17
Drrrrr-rup.


212
0:6:46,17 --> 0:6:47,85
2,000 nails.


213
0:6:47,85 --> 0:6:48,52
Look at this Higgensworth.


214
0:6:48,52 --> 0:6:49,32
These are two--


215
0:6:49,32 --> 0:6:49,94
HIGGENSWORTH: [BEEP]


216
0:6:49,94 --> 0:6:50,875
is that?


217
0:6:50,875 --> 0:6:51,53
STEVE SPANGLER: That's find.


218
0:6:51,53 --> 0:6:52,26
Don't worry about it.


219
0:6:52,26 --> 0:6:53,8
It's just a little thing.


220
0:6:53,8 --> 0:6:54,15
You're going to be
perfectly fine.


221
0:6:54,15 --> 0:6:56,81
This is a carny stunt that's
been done for hundreds and


222
0:6:56,81 --> 0:6:58,35
hundreds of years, maybe
thousands of--


223
0:6:58,35 --> 0:6:59,6
who knows.


224
0:6:59,6 --> 0:7:0,59
I don't-- maybe Egyptians
did this.


225
0:7:0,59 --> 0:7:1,33
Maybe they didn't.


226
0:7:1,33 --> 0:7:2,1
I don't know.


227
0:7:2,1 --> 0:7:3,89
But today you're going
to lay on this, and


228
0:7:3,89 --> 0:7:5,45
it's going to be awesome.


229
0:7:5,45 --> 0:7:6,86
They're going to love you.


230
0:7:6,86 --> 0:7:7,67
HIGGENSWORTH: All right.


231
0:7:7,67 --> 0:7:10,2
STEVE SPANGLER: I would do it
myself, but I have to talk and


232
0:7:10,2 --> 0:7:11,76
explain what's working.


233
0:7:11,76 --> 0:7:14,0
So that's why I'm asking you
to be the star of the show.


234
0:7:14,0 --> 0:7:14,84
HIGGENSWORTH: That sounds
really important.


235
0:7:14,84 --> 0:7:15,52
STEVE SPANGLER: OK.


236
0:7:15,52 --> 0:7:16,12
Just--


237
0:7:16,12 --> 0:7:17,22
why do you have a pillow?


238
0:7:17,22 --> 0:7:18,59
HIGGENSWORTH: Don't
worry about that.


239
0:7:18,59 --> 0:7:19,37
STEVE SPANGLER: OK.


240
0:7:19,37 --> 0:7:20,75
Just put it here.


241
0:7:20,75 --> 0:7:21,2
OK.


242
0:7:21,2 --> 0:7:21,93
This is going to be great.


243
0:7:21,93 --> 0:7:22,393
Ouch.


244
0:7:22,393 --> 0:7:23,45
OK.


245
0:7:23,45 --> 0:7:25,13
Important if you're doing
this at home--


246
0:7:25,13 --> 0:7:27,31
I mean don't do this at home.


247
0:7:27,31 --> 0:7:30,14
But if you're helping a friend
do it at a friend's home, you


248
0:7:30,14 --> 0:7:31,95
have to help them down
onto the nails.


249
0:7:31,95 --> 0:7:33,4
So you just don't go lay
down on the nails.


250
0:7:33,4 --> 0:7:33,78
So watch.


251
0:7:33,78 --> 0:7:34,81
I'm going to help you,
Higgensworth.


252
0:7:34,81 --> 0:7:35,3
Ready.


253
0:7:35,3 --> 0:7:36,8
So I'm going to hold your
wrist like this.


254
0:7:36,8 --> 0:7:36,65
Now go ahead.


255
0:7:36,65 --> 0:7:37,765
You're just going to sit down.


256
0:7:37,765 --> 0:7:38,12
OK.


257
0:7:38,12 --> 0:7:38,87
HIGGENSWORTH: All right.


258
0:7:38,87 --> 0:7:39,45
STEVE SPANGLER: Ahh.


259
0:7:39,45 --> 0:7:40,51
Perfect.


260
0:7:40,51 --> 0:7:40,77
OK.


261
0:7:40,77 --> 0:7:41,51
Now ready?


262
0:7:41,51 --> 0:7:43,14
And you're just going to kind
of put your hands there and


263
0:7:43,14 --> 0:7:44,41
kind of lay down.


264
0:7:44,41 --> 0:7:44,91
OK.


265
0:7:44,91 --> 0:7:47,8
Your head is going to be
back here like this.


266
0:7:47,8 --> 0:7:48,22
All right here.


267
0:7:48,22 --> 0:7:49,666
I'd better take this hat.


268
0:7:49,666 --> 0:7:50,274
HIGGENSWORTH: Yeah.


269
0:7:50,274 --> 0:7:50,64
Get that off.


270
0:7:50,64 --> 0:7:50,95
STEVE SPANGLER: OK.


271
0:7:50,95 --> 0:7:51,13
Good.


272
0:7:51,13 --> 0:7:51,99
HIGGENSWORTH: All right.


273
0:7:51,99 --> 0:7:52,24
STEVE SPANGLER: OK.


274
0:7:52,24 --> 0:7:53,51
How is that?


275
0:7:53,51 --> 0:7:54,192
HIGGENSWORTH: Pretty good.


276
0:7:54,192 --> 0:7:55,4
STEVE SPANGLER: How
does that feel?


277
0:7:55,4 --> 0:7:56,41
HIGGENSWORTH: Not terrible.


278
0:7:56,41 --> 0:7:57,94
STEVE SPANGLER: Is
that pretty cool?


279
0:7:57,94 --> 0:7:58,982
HIGGENSWORTH: Yeah.


280
0:7:58,982 --> 0:8:0,71
I think we're good.


281
0:8:0,71 --> 0:8:2,35
STEVE SPANGLER: This, ladies and
gentlemen, is the bed of


282
0:8:2,35 --> 0:8:3,32
nails trick.


283
0:8:3,32 --> 0:8:6,32
And it kind of is boring.


284
0:8:6,32 --> 0:8:8,78
You see, it's boring because for
years and years and years


285
0:8:8,78 --> 0:8:10,0
people have done the
bed of nails.


286
0:8:10,0 --> 0:8:12,22
But see, the wow moment
is the moment that the


287
0:8:12,22 --> 0:8:13,69
person touches the nails.


288
0:8:13,69 --> 0:8:16,43
When he sat down here like this
and then he started to


289
0:8:16,43 --> 0:8:18,44
lay back, you knew he wasn't
going to get hurt.


290
0:8:18,44 --> 0:8:20,95
And so all that motion of him
laying down and finally the


291
0:8:20,95 --> 0:8:22,98
ta-dah moment, there is not
ta-dah moment because


292
0:8:22,98 --> 0:8:23,985
all he's doing is--


293
0:8:23,985 --> 0:8:24,68
HIGGENSWORTH: Steve, Steve.


294
0:8:24,68 --> 0:8:25,535
Am I done?


295
0:8:25,535 --> 0:8:26,67
STEVE SPANGLER: No
we got more.


296
0:8:26,67 --> 0:8:28,72
So-- here, just wear this.


297
0:8:28,72 --> 0:8:29,54
HIGGENSWORTH: What
is this for?


298
0:8:29,54 --> 0:8:30,67
STEVE SPANGLER: Don't
worry about it.


299
0:8:30,67 --> 0:8:31,423
It's fine.


300
0:8:31,423 --> 0:8:32,21
HIGGENSWORTH: All right.


301
0:8:32,21 --> 0:8:32,929
STEVE SPANGLER: OK.


302
0:8:32,929 --> 0:8:33,85
Just stay right there.


303
0:8:33,85 --> 0:8:37,24
For years, people have done
this classic stunt.


304
0:8:37,24 --> 0:8:41,69
And Higgensworth is going to
perform the crushing cinder


305
0:8:41,69 --> 0:8:43,7
block trick.


306
0:8:43,7 --> 0:8:46,3
And this is where we take a
cinder block and we put it on


307
0:8:46,3 --> 0:8:47,43
Higgensworth like this.


308
0:8:47,43 --> 0:8:50,18
All right, Higgensworth,
this is a cinder block.


309
0:8:50,18 --> 0:8:52,55
I don't know exactly
where to put it.


310
0:8:52,55 --> 0:8:53,8
Do you want it right here?


311
0:8:53,8 --> 0:8:54,644
HIGGENSWORTH: Yeah.


312
0:8:54,644 --> 0:8:57,42
STEVE SPANGLER: Does
that feel good?


313
0:8:57,42 --> 0:8:59,69
I've never actually done this
before, but I read about it on


314
0:8:59,69 --> 0:9:0,18
the internet.


315
0:9:0,18 --> 0:9:0,53
OK.


316
0:9:0,53 --> 0:9:2,15
I'm just going to smash down.


317
0:9:2,15 --> 0:9:2,625
You're ready?


318
0:9:2,625 --> 0:9:3,76
Here we go.


319
0:9:3,76 --> 0:9:6,28
Drum roll please.


320
0:9:6,28 --> 0:9:7,31
Drum roll.


321
0:9:7,31 --> 0:9:9,66
HIGGENSWORTH: Brrrrrrrrrr.


322
0:9:9,66 --> 0:9:10,6
STEVE SPANGLER: Louder.


323
0:9:10,6 --> 0:9:11,9
Here it goes.


324
0:9:11,9 --> 0:9:11,578
HIGGENSWORTH: Brrrrrrrrr.


325
0:9:11,578 --> 0:9:14,18
[BANG]


326
0:9:14,18 --> 0:9:15,73
STEVE SPANGLER: Look at that.


327
0:9:15,73 --> 0:9:17,51
And he's OK, ladies
and gentlemen.


328
0:9:17,51 --> 0:9:19,88
I remove this from
the Higgensworth.


329
0:9:19,88 --> 0:9:20,89
Look at this.


330
0:9:20,89 --> 0:9:22,95
He's perfectly fine.


331
0:9:22,95 --> 0:9:24,11
You did such a good job.


332
0:9:24,11 --> 0:9:25,8
I think you're going to actually
get a t-shirt for


333
0:9:25,8 --> 0:9:26,43
doing this.


334
0:9:26,43 --> 0:9:26,85
All right.


335
0:9:26,85 --> 0:9:27,62
HIGGENSWORTH: A t-shirt?


336
0:9:27,62 --> 0:9:28,13
STEVE SPANGLER: Yes.


337
0:9:28,13 --> 0:9:29,545
This is the other part
that's important.


338
0:9:29,545 --> 0:9:30,33
Help them back up again.


339
0:9:30,33 --> 0:9:31,73
Otherwise, they get hurt at
the end of the trick.


340
0:9:31,73 --> 0:9:33,5
And then you're not
amazing anymore.


341
0:9:33,5 --> 0:9:35,0
I'm going to help you
Higgensworth.


342
0:9:35,0 --> 0:9:35,94
Are you OK?


343
0:9:35,94 --> 0:9:36,43
OK.


344
0:9:36,43 --> 0:9:37,72
Lift up.


345
0:9:37,72 --> 0:9:39,15
Perfect.


346
0:9:39,15 --> 0:9:40,93
Look at your back.


347
0:9:40,93 --> 0:9:43,47
There's indentations all over
your back, but, see, it's


348
0:9:43,47 --> 0:9:44,68
perfectly fine.


349
0:9:44,68 --> 0:9:45,14
You're fine.


350
0:9:45,14 --> 0:9:46,25
HIGGENSWORTH: I'm good.


351
0:9:46,25 --> 0:9:47,254
STEVE SPANGLER: Turn around.


352
0:9:47,254 --> 0:9:48,526
Ta-dah.


353
0:9:48,526 --> 0:9:49,31
HIGGENSWORTH: I survived.


354
0:9:49,31 --> 0:9:51,65
STEVE SPANGLER: He'll never
actually have kids,


355
0:9:51,65 --> 0:9:54,96
but he did the trick.


356
0:9:54,96 --> 0:9:55,55
It was awesome.


357
0:9:55,55 --> 0:9:56,1
All right.


358
0:9:56,1 --> 0:9:57,47
So I need you to do
it one more time.


359
0:9:57,47 --> 0:9:58,746
So I'm going to have
you just lay down.


360
0:9:58,746 --> 0:10:0,36
HIGGENSWORTH: I don't want
to do it another time.


361
0:10:0,36 --> 0:10:0,88
STEVE SPANGLER: It's fine.


362
0:10:0,88 --> 0:10:1,14
Don't worry about it.


363
0:10:1,14 --> 0:10:1,38
Just--


364
0:10:1,38 --> 0:10:2,982
I'll let you go home
early today.


365
0:10:2,982 --> 0:10:4,43
HIGGENSWORTH: That's fair.


366
0:10:4,43 --> 0:10:4,96
STEVE SPANGLER: OK.


367
0:10:4,96 --> 0:10:6,62
So we're just going to lay
down on it one more time.


368
0:10:6,62 --> 0:10:7,5
I got another idea.


369
0:10:7,5 --> 0:10:7,96
Come on.


370
0:10:7,96 --> 0:10:8,34
Play along.


371
0:10:8,34 --> 0:10:10,908
HIGGENSWORTH: All right.


372
0:10:10,908 --> 0:10:12,53
STEVE SPANGLER: Well, after
the last time Higgensworth


373
0:10:12,53 --> 0:10:14,15
pulled me off to the side
and said, could I


374
0:10:14,15 --> 0:10:14,97
please do it again?


375
0:10:14,97 --> 0:10:15,98
And I said, sure.


376
0:10:15,98 --> 0:10:16,697
Right, Higgensworth?


377
0:10:16,697 --> 0:10:17,451
HIGGENSWORTH: Yep.


378
0:10:17,451 --> 0:10:19,31
STEVE SPANGLER: So here's
what I was thinking.


379
0:10:19,31 --> 0:10:21,25
This a totally a boring
demonstration because the


380
0:10:21,25 --> 0:10:23,13
moment of wow is lost.


381
0:10:23,13 --> 0:10:25,89
Wouldn't it be really
cool if the nails


382
0:10:25,89 --> 0:10:27,445
actually lifted you up.


383
0:10:27,445 --> 0:10:30,384
What if you just got lift--
hey, hey, hey.


384
0:10:30,384 --> 0:10:31,17
What--


385
0:10:31,17 --> 0:10:31,46
what--


386
0:10:31,46 --> 0:10:31,8
No.


387
0:10:31,8 --> 0:10:32,58
I didn't mean lift--


388
0:10:32,58 --> 0:10:33,96
I don't mean the whole
bed of nails lifting.


389
0:10:33,96 --> 0:10:36,8
I just meant if the nails
lifted you up.


390
0:10:36,8 --> 0:10:37,49
Like--


391
0:10:37,49 --> 0:10:38,13
Higgens--


392
0:10:38,13 --> 0:10:41,9
If you were just like
on a bed of nails.


393
0:10:41,9 --> 0:10:41,74
This--


394
0:10:41,74 --> 0:10:42,14
hey--


395
0:10:42,14 --> 0:10:45,46
Higgens, if you're--
it'll be all--


396
0:10:45,46 --> 0:10:47,37
We already did this
with 700 teachers.


397
0:10:47,37 --> 0:10:47,96
Take a look.


398
0:10:47,96 --> 0:10:48,89
How about this.


399
0:10:48,89 --> 0:10:52,4
How about 4,500 nails.


400
0:10:52,4 --> 0:10:54,63
And this is the bed
of nails from the


401
0:10:54,63 --> 0:10:56,2
Oklahoma Museum Network.


402
0:10:56,2 --> 0:10:58,69
And they're nice enough to let
us borrow it so that we can


403
0:10:58,69 --> 0:11:2,354
show teachers the difference
between pressure and support.


404
0:11:2,354 --> 0:11:4,29
FEMALE SPEAKER: There you go.


405
0:11:4,29 --> 0:11:8,162



406
0:11:8,162 --> 0:11:9,99
STEVE SPANGLER: So when
I push the button,


407
0:11:9,99 --> 0:11:11,93
4,500 nails will rise.


408
0:11:11,93 --> 0:11:12,47
FEMALE SPEAKER: [LAUGHTER]


409
0:11:12,47 --> 0:11:13,307
STEVE SPANGLER: Isn't
that weird?


410
0:11:13,307 --> 0:11:14,181
FEMALE SPEAKER: [SCREAMING].


411
0:11:14,181 --> 0:11:16,66
STEVE SPANGLER: You're going to
feel this unusual pressure


412
0:11:16,66 --> 0:11:17,83
that's all over your body.


413
0:11:17,83 --> 0:11:19,96
Isn't that kind of
an unusual piece?


414
0:11:19,96 --> 0:11:22,94
So if you put your fingers here
now, you actually can


415
0:11:22,94 --> 0:11:25,24
feel that you're on the
very tip of the nail.


416
0:11:25,24 --> 0:11:25,83
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yes.


417
0:11:25,83 --> 0:11:28,27
STEVE SPANGLER: So your body
is supported on the tip, I


418
0:11:28,27 --> 0:11:30,15
don't know, of about 1,000
nails, somewhere there.


419
0:11:30,15 --> 0:11:32,5
When I let you back down again,
keep your hands there.


420
0:11:32,5 --> 0:11:35,35
You're going to feel the tip of
the nail go into the top of


421
0:11:35,35 --> 0:11:37,2
the table, and it literally
will vanish.


422
0:11:37,2 --> 0:11:39,104
But if I took out half of those
nails, you couldn't lay


423
0:11:39,104 --> 0:11:40,32
on the bed of nails because
the pressure


424
0:11:40,32 --> 0:11:40,96
would be too much.


425
0:11:40,96 --> 0:11:42,85
Isn't that a great sensation?


426
0:11:42,85 --> 0:11:43,885
So as a teacher--


427
0:11:43,885 --> 0:11:44,46
FEMALE SPEAKER: Kind of neat.


428
0:11:44,46 --> 0:11:45,695
STEVE SPANGLER: -- what would
it feel like as a teacher if


429
0:11:45,695 --> 0:11:47,88
we had 100% support in
everything that we do?


430
0:11:47,88 --> 0:11:49,17
It'd be amazing.


431
0:11:49,17 --> 0:11:49,862
FEMALE SPEAKER: Ahhh.


432
0:11:49,862 --> 0:11:50,54
STEVE SPANGLER: Ahh.


433
0:11:50,54 --> 0:11:50,8
Isn't that great?


434
0:11:50,8 --> 0:11:51,53
FEMALE SPEAKER: It
would be awesome.


435
0:11:51,53 --> 0:11:52,95
STEVE SPANGLER: We clicked
your picture


436
0:11:52,95 --> 0:11:53,86
when you had wonder.


437
0:11:53,86 --> 0:11:54,8
All right.


438
0:11:54,8 --> 0:11:54,775
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.


439
0:11:54,775 --> 0:11:58,915
STEVE SPANGLER: And then I have
a new name tag for you in


440
0:11:58,915 --> 0:12:1,885
five minutes is [INAUDIBLE]--


441
0:12:1,885 --> 0:12:42,97
[MUSIC PLAYING]


442
0:12:42,97 --> 0:12:45,39
HIGGENSWORTH: Thanks, Steve
for the sweet shirt.


443
0:12:45,39 --> 0:12:47,44
STEVE SPANGLER: You survived
the bed of nails.


444
0:12:47,44 --> 0:12:48,28
You did a great job.


445
0:12:48,28 --> 0:12:49,12
HIGGENSWORTH: Thank you.


446
0:12:49,12 --> 0:12:49,77
STEVE SPANGLER: You
did perfect.


447
0:12:49,77 --> 0:12:52,52
You just laid on the nails, and
everything was just fine.


448
0:12:52,52 --> 0:12:53,725
I told you it'd be OK.


449
0:12:53,725 --> 0:12:55,13
HIGGENSWORTH: I guess
you were right.


450
0:12:55,13 --> 0:14:55,13
