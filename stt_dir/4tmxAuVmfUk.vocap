###3 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU (OFFSCREEN): We're here to find out about
###4 something that frankly most Jamaicans are uncomfortable
###7 talking about.
###8 It's called Obeah, and it's an Afro-Caribbean religion that
###10 has its roots in magic and sorcery.
###12 There's good aspects of it, and then there's kind of evil
###15 aspects of it.
###16 The first place we're going to go is an occult shop, an Obeah
###19 shop, so it has sort of like the materials and the things
###22 that you need for an Obeah man to do rituals and stuff.
###26 -Sounds exciting.
###26 -Yeah.
###27 Well, honestly, I'm a little scared.
###29 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU (OFFSCREEN): Can you tell us where we can
###30 find like a real Obeah man?
###32 -Could go down by Wollaston to meet Joseph.
###36 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU (OFFSCREEN): Have you ever seen a demon?
###38 -Of course, I've seen many demons.
