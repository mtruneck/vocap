1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:5,77



2
0:0:5,77 --> 0:0:7,3
THOMAS MORTON: We left Belgrade
and headed south


3
0:0:7,3 --> 0:0:8,675
through Serbia, on the
same highway as turbo


4
0:0:8,675 --> 0:0:10,35
folk grew up on.


5
0:0:10,35 --> 0:0:12,8
As we crossed the Ibar River
into the mountains of Kosovo,


6
0:0:12,8 --> 0:0:15,39
the weather darkened, and the
"Kosovo is Serbia" graffiti


7
0:0:15,39 --> 0:0:17,56
we'd been seeing since Belgrade
became more frequent


8
0:0:17,56 --> 0:0:18,81
and less nicely scrawled.


9
0:0:18,81 --> 0:0:24,92



10
0:0:24,92 --> 0:0:27,6
It's 1:30 in the morning.


11
0:0:27,6 --> 0:0:29,35
We're going to Mitrovica,
a city in the North.


12
0:0:29,35 --> 0:0:32,32
It's half Serb, half Albanian,
and there's a bunch of dudes


13
0:0:32,32 --> 0:0:38,26
on a bridge who keep the
Albanians from crossing into


14
0:0:38,26 --> 0:0:40,16
the area with the Serbs.


15
0:0:40,16 --> 0:0:44,25
We're going to go hang out with
these guys, hopefully not


16
0:0:44,25 --> 0:0:45,528
watch them beat up Albanians.


17
0:0:45,528 --> 0:0:54,19



18
0:0:54,19 --> 0:0:57,24
The problems in Kosovo date back
over 600 years of very,


19
0:0:57,24 --> 0:0:59,93
very, very confusing history.


20
0:0:59,93 --> 0:1:2,32
A long time ago, the entire
region belonged to the Serbs,


21
0:1:2,32 --> 0:1:5,329
but they lost it to
the Turks in 1389.


22
0:1:5,329 --> 0:1:7,75
And despite the fact that, since
then, the territory has


23
0:1:7,75 --> 0:1:10,68
changed hands more times than
fucking Poland, many Serbs


24
0:1:10,68 --> 0:1:13,57
still carry a grudge.


25
0:1:13,57 --> 0:1:15,9
Tension simmered during the
Tito years before finally


26
0:1:15,9 --> 0:1:19,48
erupting in 1989, when Serbs
rioted over discrimination by


27
0:1:19,48 --> 0:1:21,79
the growing Albanian majority.


28
0:1:21,79 --> 0:1:24,8
This is where Milosevic actually
became a Serbian


29
0:1:24,8 --> 0:1:27,11
nationalist, and it was
basically the flash point for


30
0:1:27,11 --> 0:1:28,36
all the wars that followed.


31
0:1:28,36 --> 0:1:31,99



32
0:1:31,99 --> 0:1:33,805
We just got to the
Kosovo border.


33
0:1:33,805 --> 0:1:35,775
There's barbed wire here.


34
0:1:35,775 --> 0:1:38,25
Are there men up there
with guns?


35
0:1:38,25 --> 0:1:39,5
No?


36
0:1:39,5 --> 0:1:42,843
It looks like a fortress.


37
0:1:42,843 --> 0:1:44,93
OK.


38
0:1:44,93 --> 0:1:47,81



39
0:1:47,81 --> 0:1:49,6
So we are now in Kosovo.


40
0:1:49,6 --> 0:1:52,33



41
0:1:52,33 --> 0:1:55,2
During the '90s, the Kosovar
Albanians accused the Serbian


42
0:1:55,2 --> 0:1:59,1
army of trying to ethnically
cleanse them from the area.


43
0:1:59,1 --> 0:2:1,5
The Kosovo Liberation Army was
formed by the Albanians,


44
0:2:1,5 --> 0:2:4,53
ostensibly to defend them from
Serbian genocide, though many


45
0:2:4,53 --> 0:2:6,67
people noticed their tactics
were eerily similar their


46
0:2:6,67 --> 0:2:9,919
enemy's, which is to
say atrocious.


47
0:2:9,919 --> 0:2:12,22
Then Bill Clinton got a blow job
and decided to bomb Serbia


48
0:2:12,22 --> 0:2:14,395
until they gave up Kosovo
to the Albanians, which


49
0:2:14,395 --> 0:2:16,21
they kind of didn't.


50
0:2:16,21 --> 0:2:18,34
Anyhoo, the tidiest symbol for
this ridiculous mess is a


51
0:2:18,34 --> 0:2:20,72
bridge in the town
of Mitrovica.


52
0:2:20,72 --> 0:2:23,48
The north side is Serbian, the
south side is Albanian, and


53
0:2:23,48 --> 0:2:25,51
every night, a group of hotheads
stand on each side


54
0:2:25,51 --> 0:2:29,9
and beat the shit out of anybody
who tries to cross.


55
0:2:29,9 --> 0:2:32,33
Even though the war officially
ended in 1999, the bridge has


56
0:2:32,33 --> 0:2:33,53
continued to be the
site of some


57
0:2:33,53 --> 0:2:35,75
extremely nasty showdowns.


58
0:2:35,75 --> 0:2:38,51
Most recently, in 2010, a
dispute over some local


59
0:2:38,51 --> 0:2:41,3
elections turned into a rock
party between the Serbian


60
0:2:41,3 --> 0:2:43,76
Bridgewatchers and their
Albanian counterparts.


61
0:2:43,76 --> 0:2:45,82
That silver-haired guy chucking
a stone in the middle


62
0:2:45,82 --> 0:2:48,317
of the bridge right there is the
Serbian Bridgewatchers' de


63
0:2:48,317 --> 0:2:51,24
facto leader, Nebojsa Jovic.


64
0:2:51,24 --> 0:2:53,18
He's been watching the bridge
for over a decade, and has


65
0:2:53,18 --> 0:2:55,465
been involved in a lot of
particularly shady incidents


66
0:2:55,465 --> 0:2:57,94
between the Serbs
and Albanians.


67
0:2:57,94 --> 0:2:59,19
NEBOJSA JOVIC:
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]


68
0:2:59,19 --> 0:3:24,71



69
0:3:24,71 --> 0:3:26,42
THOMAS MORTON: Nebojsa's basic
point is that if his


70
0:3:26,42 --> 0:3:28,88
Bridgewatchers didn't stand
guard every night, there'd be


71
0:3:28,88 --> 0:3:30,35
no one to protect the
Serbs from being


72
0:3:30,35 --> 0:3:32,58
driven out of Mitrovica.


73
0:3:32,58 --> 0:3:33,83
NEBOJSA JOVIC:
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]


74
0:3:33,83 --> 0:3:52,11



75
0:3:52,11 --> 0:3:53,45
THOMAS MORTON: While Nebojsa
claims that his men have


76
0:3:53,45 --> 0:3:55,8
called off their vigil, we
couldn't help but notice a lot


77
0:3:55,8 --> 0:3:58,5
of tough-looking motorists
making extremely aggressive


78
0:3:58,5 --> 0:4:2,11
U-turns right in front of the
bridge all night long.


79
0:4:2,11 --> 0:4:4,9
We just got done having a little
chat with our buddy,


80
0:4:4,9 --> 0:4:6,36
with the Bridgewatchers.


81
0:4:6,36 --> 0:4:9,57
I guess we're just going to
hang out here and see what


82
0:4:9,57 --> 0:4:11,894
happens, see if people just
circle all night or if they


83
0:4:11,894 --> 0:4:13,42
get out of their cars
or whatever.


84
0:4:13,42 --> 0:4:15,85
I'm kind of hoping it's
boring, because the


85
0:4:15,85 --> 0:4:17,56
alternative sounds terrifying.


86
0:4:17,56 --> 0:4:21,57



87
0:4:21,57 --> 0:4:25,83
MALE SPEAKER: Three guys on my
left, two guys sitting on the


88
0:4:25,83 --> 0:4:29,726
benches behind me, so there
is so much activity.


89
0:4:29,726 --> 0:4:33,352
If you'd like to go to the
bridge, you can freely do it.


90
0:4:33,352 --> 0:4:34,62
THOMAS MORTON: Oh, we can?


91
0:4:34,62 --> 0:4:44,34
MALE SPEAKER:
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]


92
0:4:44,34 --> 0:4:47,62
THOMAS MORTON: That's
a little foreboding.


93
0:4:47,62 --> 0:4:48,12
Yeah.


94
0:4:48,12 --> 0:4:49,882
Well, let's go to the
bridge, then.


95
0:4:49,882 --> 0:4:53,33



96
0:4:53,33 --> 0:4:55,21
Crossing the bridge in Mitrovica
was actually sort of


97
0:4:55,21 --> 0:4:55,92
no big deal.


98
0:4:55,92 --> 0:4:59,125
It was just like crossing any
bridge that has no lights and


99
0:4:59,125 --> 0:5:1,7
a permanent detachment
of UN soldiers


100
0:5:1,7 --> 0:5:2,55
stationed in the middle.


101
0:5:2,55 --> 0:5:4,5
Still, there's something eerie
about being the only people


102
0:5:4,5 --> 0:5:6,49
besides cops on a bridge
where hundreds of other


103
0:5:6,49 --> 0:5:8,0
folks have bled out.


104
0:5:8,0 --> 0:5:10,65
It's kind of like sneaking into
Antietam in the middle of


105
0:5:10,65 --> 0:5:12,2
the night, only if the Civil
War had happened,


106
0:5:12,2 --> 0:5:14,3
like, five years ago.


107
0:5:14,3 --> 0:5:20,44
There's another person doing
a U-turn very fast.


108
0:5:20,44 --> 0:5:22,47
MALE SPEAKER: They're coming to
the bridge, making U-turn,


109
0:5:22,47 --> 0:5:23,57
going back.


110
0:5:23,57 --> 0:5:27,38
There, just the same as here.


111
0:5:27,38 --> 0:5:28,3
THOMAS MORTON: There's
no reason for


112
0:5:28,3 --> 0:5:30,99
them to make a U-turn.


113
0:5:30,99 --> 0:5:32,73
Despite the fact that nothing
kicked off while we were


114
0:5:32,73 --> 0:5:35,4
there, it was definitely
spooky on the bridge.


115
0:5:35,4 --> 0:5:37,92
We also had no idea whether or
not the Albanian side would be


116
0:5:37,92 --> 0:5:39,705
as hectic as Nebojsa
had warned us.


117
0:5:39,705 --> 0:5:44,69



118
0:5:44,69 --> 0:5:45,63
Hey, it's Thomas.


119
0:5:45,63 --> 0:5:47,2
I'm at the [INAUDIBLE]


120
0:5:47,2 --> 0:5:49,72
Cafe, which is a very nice,
European-style place.


121
0:5:49,72 --> 0:5:54,13
A couple years ago, though, an
Albanian boy walked across the


122
0:5:54,13 --> 0:5:55,53
bridge and threw
a bomb in here.


123
0:5:55,53 --> 0:5:58,2
And that wasn't the first bomb
that's gone off in here.


124
0:5:58,2 --> 0:5:59,37
This is the bridge.


125
0:5:59,37 --> 0:6:0,71
You see a heavy police
presence there,


126
0:6:0,71 --> 0:6:2,26
but it's that's it.


127
0:6:2,26 --> 0:6:7,58
That tiny little strip is what
divides Albanian Kosovo from


128
0:6:7,58 --> 0:6:8,75
Serbian Kosovo.


129
0:6:8,75 --> 0:6:12,78
And so one thing that's weird
is we noticed a lot of cars


130
0:6:12,78 --> 0:6:14,72
pull over right before they
cross the bridge.


131
0:6:14,72 --> 0:6:18,5
And the drivers hop out and pop
off their license plates.


132
0:6:18,5 --> 0:6:19,93
And the deal is, if you're
driving a car in the wrong


133
0:6:19,93 --> 0:6:22,88
neighborhood with the wrong
plates, you're basically


134
0:6:22,88 --> 0:6:24,44
asking to get killed.


135
0:6:24,44 --> 0:6:27,335
And you'll see a number of cars
just driving around with


136
0:6:27,335 --> 0:6:29,97
no plates at all, like
it's no big thing.


137
0:6:29,97 --> 0:6:32,6
I mean, we've been getting,
I feel like,


138
0:6:32,6 --> 0:6:35,7
one side of the story.


139
0:6:35,7 --> 0:6:38,79
So we're going to go
over there and--


140
0:6:38,79 --> 0:6:42,856
basically into Albanian Kosovo
and see what it's like.


141
0:6:42,856 --> 0:6:45,45
On the Albanian side of the
bridge, we met a group of kids


142
0:6:45,45 --> 0:6:48,3
who didn't quite live up to the
menacing hoard Nebojsa had


143
0:6:48,3 --> 0:6:49,28
led us to expect.


144
0:6:49,28 --> 0:6:57,45



145
0:6:57,45 --> 0:6:58,7
THOMAS MORTON: This
is the spot.


146
0:6:58,7 --> 0:7:1,69



147
0:7:1,69 --> 0:7:3,7
The old main drag.


148
0:7:3,7 --> 0:7:5,53
Have you ever had any trouble
with the Bridgewatchers?


149
0:7:5,53 --> 0:7:6,87
We keep hearing about them.


150
0:7:6,87 --> 0:7:15,596



151
0:7:15,596 --> 0:7:16,846
THOMAS MORTON: I'm sorry.


152
0:7:16,846 --> 0:7:27,85



153
0:7:27,85 --> 0:7:31,45
THOMAS MORTON: Right, they just
look like normal folks.


154
0:7:31,45 --> 0:7:36,5



155
0:7:36,5 --> 0:7:37,36
THOMAS MORTON: I didn't know
you'd grown up in the North.


156
0:7:37,36 --> 0:7:43,24



157
0:7:43,24 --> 0:7:44,37
THOMAS MORTON: A Serb friend?


158
0:7:44,37 --> 0:7:45,62
And you'll go with him?


159
0:7:45,62 --> 0:7:52,2



160
0:7:52,2 --> 0:7:53,27
THOMAS MORTON: Right.


161
0:7:53,27 --> 0:8:14,3



162
0:8:14,3 --> 0:8:15,36
THOMAS MORTON: It's
like lawless.


163
0:8:15,36 --> 0:8:16,61
Right.


164
0:8:16,61 --> 0:8:27,43



165
0:8:27,43 --> 0:8:28,68
THOMAS MORTON: Snitches
get stitches.


166
0:8:28,68 --> 0:8:55,49



167
0:8:55,49 --> 0:8:57,3
THOMAS MORTON: No, we walked
right through.


168
0:8:57,3 --> 0:9:0,24
I was waiting for a frisk
and the dogs and stuff.


169
0:9:0,24 --> 0:9:7,24



170
0:9:7,24 --> 0:9:9,27
THOMAS MORTON: Our day on the
Albanian side made it totally


171
0:9:9,27 --> 0:9:10,745
clear what the real
problem is here.


172
0:9:10,745 --> 0:9:12,44
It isn't violence or genocide.


173
0:9:12,44 --> 0:9:14,48
It's demographics.


174
0:9:14,48 --> 0:9:16,42
The Serbian side is practically
empty, and what


175
0:9:16,42 --> 0:9:18,46
people you do see all seem to
be pretty fucking old or


176
0:9:18,46 --> 0:9:20,24
bussed-in skinheads.


177
0:9:20,24 --> 0:9:22,855
Then you cross the bridge,
and it's all kids--


178
0:9:22,855 --> 0:9:25,66
not scary kids, either, just
regular kids hanging out and


179
0:9:25,66 --> 0:9:28,39
otherwise minding their own,
but a lot of them.


180
0:9:28,39 --> 0:9:30,76
And that's what the
real threat is.


181
0:9:30,76 --> 0:9:31,89
Albanian Kosovo is
growing, while


182
0:9:31,89 --> 0:9:33,56
Serbian Kosovo is shrinking.


183
0:9:33,56 --> 0:9:34,84
And all the beatings
in the world ain't


184
0:9:34,84 --> 0:9:36,9
going to change that.


185
0:9:36,9 --> 0:11:36,9
