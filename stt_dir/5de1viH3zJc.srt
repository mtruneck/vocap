SAMY AL-JAMAL: In the Middle
East, I think people are


4
0:0:26,87 --> 0:0:30,105
warriors by nature.


5
0:0:30,105 --> 0:0:32,17
They're born in conflicts.


6
0:0:32,17 --> 0:0:34,808
They live their whole
lives in conflicts.


7
0:0:34,808 --> 0:0:37,541
And I think that martial arts,
for them, is something that


8
0:0:37,541 --> 0:0:38,791
suits them perfectly.


9
0:0:38,791 --> 0:0:42,263

SAMY AL-JAMAL: Go, fight.


13
0:1:11,73 --> 0:1:13,146
Let's go.

15
0:1:14,396 --> 0:1:16,64



16
0:1:16,64 --> 0:1:18,93
SAMY AL-JAMAL: My parents were
Palestinian refugees.


17
0:1:18,93 --> 0:1:23,64
They went to Brazil
in the early '60s.


18
0:1:23,64 --> 0:1:26,86
I was born and raised
in Brazil.


19
0:1:26,86 --> 0:1:28,53
They came back to Jordan.


20
0:1:28,53 --> 0:1:33,8
They acquired the Jordanian
passport and citizenship.


21
0:1:33,8 --> 0:1:34,49
I also did that.


22
0:1:34,49 --> 0:1:39,41
So basically, I'm
Brazilian-Jordanian but lived


23
0:1:39,41 --> 0:1:40,62
all my life in Brazil.


24
0:1:40,62 --> 0:1:45,44
And I've been here living for
the past five years in Jordan.


25
0:1:45,44 --> 0:1:49,59
My name is Samy Al-Jamal, I'm a
fourth degree black belt in


26
0:1:49,59 --> 0:1:51,14
Brazilian jujitsu.


27
0:1:51,14 --> 0:1:52,47
I'm a black belt in judo.


28
0:1:52,47 --> 0:1:54,82
I'm a black belt in
Karate, Shotokan.


29
0:1:54,82 --> 0:1:57,6
I needed to defend myself
in the streets of Rio.


30
0:1:57,6 --> 0:2:0,9
Rio is not an easy place for you
to grow up, especially in


31
0:2:0,9 --> 0:2:3,99
the streets at the time
was very violent.


32
0:2:3,99 --> 0:2:7,8
So I decided to start learning
martial arts in Brazil.


33
0:2:7,8 --> 0:2:12,4
And since I was five years old
up to now, I'm 46, I still


34
0:2:12,4 --> 0:2:14,72
train martial arts.


35
0:2:14,72 --> 0:2:20,91
I decided to come here, stay
here, and teach jujitsu for


36
0:2:20,91 --> 0:2:24,96
the Jordanian people, because
I thought it would be very


37
0:2:24,96 --> 0:2:30,93
nice for them to learn the
true, original jujitsu.


38
0:2:30,93 --> 0:2:35,61
And I stayed here and I opened
the school in order to teach


39
0:2:35,61 --> 0:2:39,15
the real jujitsu, the real
Brazilian jujitsu.


40
0:2:39,15 --> 0:2:41,35
Overall it's a way of life.


41
0:2:41,35 --> 0:2:43,8
So I thought it was very
important for the Jordanian


42
0:2:43,8 --> 0:2:45,81
people to be exposed to that.


43
0:2:45,81 --> 0:2:48,36
And I actually felt a difference
here when I first


44
0:2:48,36 --> 0:2:50,1
came and started wrestling
with they guys.


45
0:2:50,1 --> 0:2:51,26
I thought they were
very strong.


46
0:2:51,26 --> 0:3:3,58



47
0:3:3,58 --> 0:3:6,94
And I don't think the Muslim
empire was an empire just by


48
0:3:6,94 --> 0:3:9,9
chance, because these guys were
really, really strong


49
0:3:9,9 --> 0:3:11,1
since back then.


50
0:3:11,1 --> 0:3:17,8
The Source MMA is located in
Rabia, which is west Amman, in


51
0:3:17,8 --> 0:3:18,31
the heart of the city.


52
0:3:18,31 --> 0:3:22,74
And our dojo is about 200
meters for training.


53
0:3:22,74 --> 0:3:24,93
I think we are like a
mini New York here.


54
0:3:24,93 --> 0:3:28,83
It's like a melting pot of
cultures, religions.


55
0:3:28,83 --> 0:3:32,37
And sometimes we have people
in the cage behind me here


56
0:3:32,37 --> 0:3:36,82
praying, and right next to
them people fighting, and


57
0:3:36,82 --> 0:3:38,95
right behind them people
actually doing mixed martial


58
0:3:38,95 --> 0:3:42,14
arts and hitting each other,
which I think is a beautiful


59
0:3:42,14 --> 0:3:43,9
scene to watch.


60
0:3:43,9 --> 0:3:45,37
And not many places in
the world can have


61
0:3:45,37 --> 0:3:47,12
this type of scenery.


62
0:3:47,12 --> 0:3:52,35
We have foreigners that are
non-native Arabic-speaking


63
0:3:52,35 --> 0:3:58,39
people, and because they become
Muslim they come to


64
0:3:58,39 --> 0:4:3,31
Jordan, to live in Jordan to
live a life of a Muslim.


65
0:4:3,31 --> 0:4:5,9
And they also are into martial
arts, so they come


66
0:4:5,9 --> 0:4:7,77
and train with us.


67
0:4:7,77 --> 0:4:12,86
And they're very religious, but
at the same time very good


68
0:4:12,86 --> 0:4:14,43
martial artists.


69
0:4:14,43 --> 0:4:16,39
RAMZI NABULSI: My name's
Ramzi Nabulsi.


70
0:4:16,39 --> 0:4:18,42
I'm from Australia--


71
0:4:18,42 --> 0:4:19,67
Melbourne, Australia.


72
0:4:19,67 --> 0:4:21,37



73
0:4:21,37 --> 0:4:24,25
I often get asked why did
I come to Jordan.


74
0:4:24,25 --> 0:4:28,26
Why did I leave the land of milk
and honey of Australia


75
0:4:28,26 --> 0:4:31,79
and come to the original
land of milk and honey?


76
0:4:31,79 --> 0:4:37,59
And the reason for me was to
provide an environment for my


77
0:4:37,59 --> 0:4:41,3
children and for my family
and myself where we could


78
0:4:41,3 --> 0:4:43,627
spiritually grow as people.


79
0:4:43,627 --> 0:4:55,0



80
0:4:55,0 --> 0:4:58,88
See this is learning sensitivity
and how to stick


81
0:4:58,88 --> 0:5:0,87
to your opponent.


82
0:5:0,87 --> 0:5:4,24
It's very awkward,
with the idea of


83
0:5:4,24 --> 0:5:5,63
always remaining stuck.


84
0:5:5,63 --> 0:5:7,78
So it's like a two-man drill.


85
0:5:7,78 --> 0:5:13,87
And then you can start adding
strikes and so on.


86
0:5:13,87 --> 0:5:16,52
You win when you can
move your opponent.


87
0:5:16,52 --> 0:5:20,47
And you want to do so without
having to muscle them.


88
0:5:20,47 --> 0:5:25,135
You're just feeling and
finding their center.


89
0:5:25,135 --> 0:5:27,407
The good thing about playing
with children is you don't


90
0:5:27,407 --> 0:5:28,657
become aggressive.


91
0:5:28,657 --> 0:5:36,71



92
0:5:36,71 --> 0:5:40,82
So I live in a little town off
Sports City, what's known as


93
0:5:40,82 --> 0:5:42,4
Sports City in Amman.


94
0:5:42,4 --> 0:5:44,79
It's called Haya Karupsha.


95
0:5:44,79 --> 0:5:49,82
And it's known for the many
scholars that live here.


96
0:5:49,82 --> 0:5:54,27
The community is people from
the US, the UK, Canada,


97
0:5:54,27 --> 0:6:1,3
Australia, India, and local
Arabs, Jordanians, and so on.


98
0:6:1,3 --> 0:6:3,28
So it's a big mix of people.


99
0:6:3,28 --> 0:6:8,17
And so we have every color of
the rainbow here and many


100
0:6:8,17 --> 0:6:11,71
languages, coming under the
same banner or the same


101
0:6:11,71 --> 0:6:14,88
intention to work on themselves
and improve


102
0:6:14,88 --> 0:6:16,13
themselves.


103
0:6:16,13 --> 0:6:24,4



104
0:6:24,4 --> 0:6:28,17
There is a stereotype present
within the world that Muslims


105
0:6:28,17 --> 0:6:32,67
have something in their
genetics, they just want to


106
0:6:32,67 --> 0:6:39,21
get in to violence and they have
a passion for violence.


107
0:6:39,21 --> 0:6:43,1
I'm interested very much in
the seeking a supremacy in


108
0:6:43,1 --> 0:6:46,41
fighting in terms of the
art form itself.


109
0:6:46,41 --> 0:6:54,81
So I'm looking for excellence
of fighting, which I think


110
0:6:54,81 --> 0:6:57,23
comes down to something to do
with justice, and so on.


111
0:6:57,23 --> 0:6:59,33
An importance put on being
able to stop people


112
0:6:59,33 --> 0:7:2,29
evil with your hand.


113
0:7:2,29 --> 0:7:3,9
So there's a need to do that.


114
0:7:3,9 --> 0:7:6,12
And to do that, I find that
martial arts gives you the


115
0:7:6,12 --> 0:7:9,9
tools to do so.


116
0:7:9,9 --> 0:7:13,49
So I don't find martial arts
contradicts my faith at all.


117
0:7:13,49 --> 0:7:17,97
And I find that, if anything,
it's just a tool in order to


118
0:7:17,97 --> 0:7:21,95
do what I'm supposed to do,
which is support what is good


119
0:7:21,95 --> 0:7:23,9
and stop what is bad.


120
0:7:23,9 --> 0:7:27,4
I'm interested in competing
at some point in the mixed


121
0:7:27,4 --> 0:7:33,28
martial arts arena and other
arenas, very much with the


122
0:7:33,28 --> 0:7:41,23
intention to dispel any myths
within myself, what I'm


123
0:7:41,23 --> 0:7:42,98
capable of doing.


124
0:7:42,98 --> 0:7:44,25
I don't want to lie to anyone.


125
0:7:44,25 --> 0:7:46,7
And I don't want to
lie to myself.


126
0:7:46,7 --> 0:7:49,58
So I'm studying a number
of martial arts--


127
0:7:49,58 --> 0:7:54,36
Brazilian jujitsu, and I come
from a background of Kung Fu,


128
0:7:54,36 --> 0:7:57,25
and recently have
started Tai Chi.


129
0:7:57,25 --> 0:8:0,8
Much like in the same sentiment
as Rickson Gracie


130
0:8:0,8 --> 0:8:5,59
had said in his documentary,
"Choke," in order to believe


131
0:8:5,59 --> 0:8:9,1
in what you're doing, you need
to be open to competition at


132
0:8:9,1 --> 0:8:10,35
some point.


133
0:8:10,35 --> 0:8:56,35



134
0:8:56,35 --> 0:8:57,13
SAMY AL-JAMAL: Don't
take the back.


135
0:8:57,13 --> 0:8:57,37
Let go.


136
0:8:57,37 --> 0:8:58,13
Take the back.


137
0:8:58,13 --> 0:8:59,16
Go, go.


138
0:8:59,16 --> 0:8:59,9
Two points.


139
0:8:59,9 --> 0:9:1,455
Move, move, move.


140
0:9:1,455 --> 0:9:4,48
Pass the guard.


141
0:9:4,48 --> 0:9:9,835



142
0:9:9,835 --> 0:9:10,4
What are you doing?


143
0:9:10,4 --> 0:9:12,99
Why is the hand and that
leg over there again?


144
0:9:12,99 --> 0:9:14,24
The bottom of the leg.


145
0:9:14,24 --> 0:9:17,7



146
0:9:17,7 --> 0:9:17,46
Go down.


147
0:9:17,46 --> 0:9:18,264
Go down.


148
0:9:18,264 --> 0:9:18,748
Good guard.


149
0:9:18,748 --> 0:9:20,684
Good guard.


150
0:9:20,684 --> 0:9:21,168
Stop.


151
0:9:21,168 --> 0:9:23,104
Time.


152
0:9:23,104 --> 0:9:25,524
You OK?


153
0:9:25,524 --> 0:9:26,1
No?


154
0:9:26,1 --> 0:9:28,23
It's interesting, you have a
lot of female BJJ fighters


155
0:9:28,23 --> 0:9:31,58
here, more than my school in
Brazil, more than many schools


156
0:9:31,58 --> 0:9:33,21
that I see outside.


157
0:9:33,21 --> 0:9:36,76
And although the culture here
it's a bit restricted towards


158
0:9:36,76 --> 0:9:39,1
women training martial arts,
the girls here are doing a


159
0:9:39,1 --> 0:9:42,868
very good job and this year we
made two world champions.


160
0:9:42,868 --> 0:9:46,172



161
0:9:46,172 --> 0:9:52,5
Rana, she came to me, she had
never done any sports,


162
0:9:52,5 --> 0:9:55,31
especially any sports that she
really had to push hard.


163
0:9:55,31 --> 0:9:57,86
And she started kickboxing
with me.


164
0:9:57,86 --> 0:10:0,91
And then she merged
into jujitsu.


165
0:10:0,91 --> 0:10:6,3
And last year she competed in
the European championship and


166
0:10:6,3 --> 0:10:8,16
Abu Dhabi World Pro
Championship.


167
0:10:8,16 --> 0:10:13,52
She won both, the World Pro in
her weight and open weight and


168
0:10:13,52 --> 0:10:16,97
the Portugal, also, her weight,
without anybody


169
0:10:16,97 --> 0:10:19,99
scoring one advantage on her,
which is a huge accomplishment


170
0:10:19,99 --> 0:10:21,8
for anyone.


171
0:10:21,8 --> 0:10:24,8
She's the first Arab
woman to do that.


172
0:10:24,8 --> 0:10:27,78



173
0:10:27,78 --> 0:10:30,45
RANA QUBBAJ: I don't know why,
but people think that girls


174
0:10:30,45 --> 0:10:35,505
should be delicate and they
should not be strong.


175
0:10:35,505 --> 0:10:39,66
But I was never able to follow
that concept, because I think


176
0:10:39,66 --> 0:10:42,35
everybody should be strong
because you cannot stand up


177
0:10:42,35 --> 0:10:43,73
for yourself.


178
0:10:43,73 --> 0:10:46,97
Not necessarily like being
aggressive, but every person


179
0:10:46,97 --> 0:10:49,7
should be able to stand
up on their own.


180
0:10:49,7 --> 0:10:53,3



181
0:10:53,3 --> 0:10:55,3
My name is Rana Qubbaj.


182
0:10:55,3 --> 0:10:57,2
I like to do MMA and
Brazilian jujitsu,


183
0:10:57,2 --> 0:10:59,9
mostly Brazilian jujitsu.


184
0:10:59,9 --> 0:11:1,393
And I train and compete
in jujitsu.


185
0:11:1,393 --> 0:11:5,65



186
0:11:5,65 --> 0:11:8,12
I started doing competitive
fighting by chance.


187
0:11:8,12 --> 0:11:10,12
I started doing jujitsu
by chance.


188
0:11:10,12 --> 0:11:11,83
I was just looking for
a workout to lose


189
0:11:11,83 --> 0:11:14,26
weight and get in shape.


190
0:11:14,26 --> 0:11:15,87
I was a lot overweight.


191
0:11:15,87 --> 0:11:17,1
And I had to lose some weight.


192
0:11:17,1 --> 0:11:20,79
And it was very hard for me to
get into working out because I


193
0:11:20,79 --> 0:11:23,4
knew nothing about sports.


194
0:11:23,4 --> 0:11:26,5
I tried to go to the gym,
I don't know how


195
0:11:26,5 --> 0:11:26,96
to carry the weight.


196
0:11:26,96 --> 0:11:27,59
I don't know how
to do anything.


197
0:11:27,59 --> 0:11:29,29
I tried to jog, I can't jog.


198
0:11:29,29 --> 0:11:29,85
Couldn't do anything.


199
0:11:29,85 --> 0:11:30,93
I was totally out of shape.


200
0:11:30,93 --> 0:11:32,62
I was a smoker.


201
0:11:32,62 --> 0:11:34,52
I never worked out in my life.


202
0:11:34,52 --> 0:11:38,36
So I tried a lot of things
for six months.


203
0:11:38,36 --> 0:11:40,19
And then I started kickboxing.


204
0:11:40,19 --> 0:11:42,79
There was a jujitsu
team in my gym.


205
0:11:42,79 --> 0:11:45,71
And I kept on looking at them
for like 2 and 1/2 years, and


206
0:11:45,71 --> 0:11:46,39
I didn't feel I'm interested.


207
0:11:46,39 --> 0:11:48,87
And then the first time I tried
it, I really loved it.


208
0:11:48,87 --> 0:11:51,74
The first time, the first five
minutes, I really loved it.


209
0:11:51,74 --> 0:11:56,2
And six months after there was
a tournament in Abu Dhabi.


210
0:11:56,2 --> 0:11:57,89
And I decided to try
my luck out.


211
0:11:57,89 --> 0:11:59,185
And I loved it.


212
0:11:59,185 --> 0:12:0,61
So I didn't plan for it.


213
0:12:0,61 --> 0:12:3,46



214
0:12:3,46 --> 0:12:14,31



215
0:12:14,31 --> 0:12:18,72
OK, so my normal routine is I
wake up, like, 5:30 in the


216
0:12:18,72 --> 0:12:22,64
morning, sometimes 6:00
when I'm really tired.


217
0:12:22,64 --> 0:12:26,62
I prepare my food, because I
have to eat certain stuff.


218
0:12:26,62 --> 0:12:27,47
So I prepare my food.


219
0:12:27,47 --> 0:12:30,65
I cook whatever I want
to cook, whatever.


220
0:12:30,65 --> 0:12:36,71
I have to prepare four meals.


221
0:12:36,71 --> 0:12:39,2
Up to now, I have to
eat four meals.


222
0:12:39,2 --> 0:12:40,44
So I prepare my four meals.


223
0:12:40,44 --> 0:12:45,3
And I try to be in the
gym like 6:30, 7:00.


224
0:12:45,3 --> 0:12:48,29
I start my morning workout
routine, which is basically


225
0:12:48,29 --> 0:12:50,56
cardio, strength, and
weight-lifting and strength


226
0:12:50,56 --> 0:12:53,71
exercises and whatever--
balance-- whatever I


227
0:12:53,71 --> 0:12:54,81
need to work on.


228
0:12:54,81 --> 0:12:56,1
So that goes in the morning.


229
0:12:56,1 --> 0:12:59,56
And then I go to work.


230
0:12:59,56 --> 0:13:1,45
I try to be on time at 9:00.


231
0:13:1,45 --> 0:13:4,9
And I work 9-6.


232
0:13:4,9 --> 0:13:8,24
My training is usually at 7:00,
my second training.


233
0:13:8,24 --> 0:13:13,58
So I leave from work to
the dojo, to the gym.


234
0:13:13,58 --> 0:13:16,55
I'm actually the first Arab
girl to win an IBJJF


235
0:13:16,55 --> 0:13:19,29
tournament, which is the
International Brazilian


236
0:13:19,29 --> 0:13:20,6
Jujitsu Federation.


237
0:13:20,6 --> 0:13:23,47
These are the tournaments that
are organized by the


238
0:13:23,47 --> 0:13:24,76
International Federation.


239
0:13:24,76 --> 0:13:26,9
So they're the hardest to win.


240
0:13:26,9 --> 0:13:29,16
So the Europeans was the
first IBJJF tournament


241
0:13:29,16 --> 0:13:30,1
I've ever been to.


242
0:13:30,1 --> 0:13:34,5
And I'm the first Arab
girl to win that one.


243
0:13:34,5 --> 0:13:35,84
There are a bit of difficulties
actually.


244
0:13:35,84 --> 0:13:38,682
The community's a bit
conservative about girls and


245
0:13:38,682 --> 0:13:48,165
guys grappling together and
any form of being in very


246
0:13:48,165 --> 0:13:48,88
close distance.


247
0:13:48,88 --> 0:13:52,73
So it's harder here, because
girls outside get more


248
0:13:52,73 --> 0:13:56,37
opportunities, or they
fight with guys more.


249
0:13:56,37 --> 0:13:58,34
And guys are stronger,
physically, obviously.


250
0:13:58,34 --> 0:14:1,669
So that helps you develop
your jujitsu more.


251
0:14:1,669 --> 0:14:10,66



252
0:14:10,66 --> 0:14:15,75
My family, the first time they
thought it was just a trip.


253
0:14:15,75 --> 0:14:17,88
They knew I'm fighting but
nobody took me seriously.


254
0:14:17,88 --> 0:14:21,37
And I still remember I was
pissed off when I lost.


255
0:14:21,37 --> 0:14:23,82
And then my father called
and said, how'd it go?


256
0:14:23,82 --> 0:14:24,64
And I was like, I lost.


257
0:14:24,64 --> 0:14:25,64
And he was like, why
are you pissed off?


258
0:14:25,64 --> 0:14:27,32
Of course you're
going to lose.


259
0:14:27,32 --> 0:14:30,26
So nobody took me seriously
the first time.


260
0:14:30,26 --> 0:14:33,47
The second time when
I told them I won,


261
0:14:33,47 --> 0:14:34,73
it was like a surprise.


262
0:14:34,73 --> 0:14:35,68
Everyone was surprised.


263
0:14:35,68 --> 0:14:37,435
It's like, how can you
win in the Europeans?


264
0:14:37,435 --> 0:14:40,36



265
0:14:40,36 --> 0:14:42,4
The last competition,
the World Forum,


266
0:14:42,4 --> 0:14:42,84
I didn't see that.


267
0:14:42,84 --> 0:14:43,95
I wish I could see that.


268
0:14:43,95 --> 0:14:45,18
But it was on TV.


269
0:14:45,18 --> 0:14:47,71
So my sisters were telling me my
parents panicked when they


270
0:14:47,71 --> 0:14:49,71
saw me fighting on TV.


271
0:14:49,71 --> 0:14:52,63
And especially in jujitsu it's
sometimes complicated, because


272
0:14:52,63 --> 0:14:56,454
you can be on bottom and winning
and you are the one


273
0:14:56,454 --> 0:14:57,81
who's in control and you're
the one who's


274
0:14:57,81 --> 0:14:59,62
not in pain or anything.


275
0:14:59,62 --> 0:15:1,64
But it doesn't look this way.


276
0:15:1,64 --> 0:15:3,28
So I was winning all the
fights and they were


277
0:15:3,28 --> 0:15:6,56
panicking at home.


278
0:15:6,56 --> 0:15:9,63
So this is my Dad.


279
0:15:9,63 --> 0:15:11,142
RANA'S FATHER: Hello.


280
0:15:11,142 --> 0:15:12,35
RANA QUBBAJ: My dad.


281
0:15:12,35 --> 0:15:15,69
My mom went away.


282
0:15:15,69 --> 0:15:19,35
I don't think that living in my
parents' house effects my


283
0:15:19,35 --> 0:15:22,97
ability to be a good fighter,
because I know that our world


284
0:15:22,97 --> 0:15:27,5
is conservative, but even not
every part of the society is


285
0:15:27,5 --> 0:15:28,29
as conservative.


286
0:15:28,29 --> 0:15:30,96
So my parents have no problem
with me going out, training,


287
0:15:30,96 --> 0:15:32,5
travelling to compete.


288
0:15:32,5 --> 0:15:35,76
And I've always travelled before
competitions and after


289
0:15:35,76 --> 0:15:36,74
competitions.


290
0:15:36,74 --> 0:15:39,6
So for me, it's not a problem.


291
0:15:39,6 --> 0:15:41,75
I know it might be a problem
for other Arab girls.


292
0:15:41,75 --> 0:15:43,7
But for me it's not.


293
0:15:43,7 --> 0:15:44,64
Thank god.


294
0:15:44,64 --> 0:15:48,48
And sometimes guys in this
country, unfortunately, have


295
0:15:48,48 --> 0:15:53,45
the habit of just commenting on
girls when they're walking.


296
0:15:53,45 --> 0:16:0,65
So it used to annoy me more
before I used to do jujitsu.


297
0:16:0,65 --> 0:16:5,217
For example, I never would
have stopped at an ATM at


298
0:16:5,217 --> 0:16:8,41
night to withdraw money
two years ago.


299
0:16:8,41 --> 0:16:10,36
But now I don't care.


300
0:16:10,36 --> 0:16:13,95
I had to use my jujitsu
only once.


301
0:16:13,95 --> 0:16:17,2
I was walking down the street
and this guy started making


302
0:16:17,2 --> 0:16:19,44
comments and I ignored him
because this is what we do.


303
0:16:19,44 --> 0:16:21,28
We ignore the guys when
they do that.


304
0:16:21,28 --> 0:16:22,906
And then he grabbed my hand.


305
0:16:22,906 --> 0:16:24,77
He was like, I'm
talking to you.


306
0:16:24,77 --> 0:16:26,92
So I had to use some jujitsu.


307
0:16:26,92 --> 0:16:28,17
But not too much.


308
0:16:28,17 --> 0:16:32,37



309
0:16:32,37 --> 0:16:35,82
SAMY AL-JAMAL: Every part of
society, they have something


310
0:16:35,82 --> 0:16:40,4
against it, which, to me,
creates a platform for them to


311
0:16:40,4 --> 0:16:43,83
show freedom, for them to
actually go there and conquer


312
0:16:43,83 --> 0:16:46,9
their rights and show to people
that people are wrong


313
0:16:46,9 --> 0:16:50,32
through going to championships,
conquering


314
0:16:50,32 --> 0:16:51,61
world championships.


315
0:16:51,61 --> 0:16:54,18
And that's what I tell them all
the time, their results in


316
0:16:54,18 --> 0:16:56,65
the martial arts is what's
going to make people


317
0:16:56,65 --> 0:16:57,85
understand and except
them better.


318
0:16:57,85 --> 0:18:57,85
