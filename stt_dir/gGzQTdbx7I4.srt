0:0:3,1 --> 0:0:5,1
This is "All Around Losing."
And today I'm


5
0:0:5,1 --> 0:0:6,67
learning how to fight.


6
0:0:6,67 --> 0:0:9,9
When this started, it
was a lot of fun.


7
0:0:9,9 --> 0:0:11,68
I got to wear the cool mask
and the dick guard and


8
0:0:11,68 --> 0:0:13,19
practice punching the air.


9
0:0:13,19 --> 0:0:15,22
But by the time I was
getting choked out,


10
0:0:15,22 --> 0:0:16,9
I came to an epiphany--


11
0:0:16,9 --> 0:0:20,4
fighting is hard and passing
out is easy.


12
0:0:20,4 --> 0:0:21,84
But if being manly
was painless,


13
0:0:21,84 --> 0:0:23,65
everyone would be a man.


14
0:0:23,65 --> 0:0:24,49
My name is Harry.


15
0:0:24,49 --> 0:0:26,53
And I've been a loser
for most of my life.


16
0:0:26,53 --> 0:0:28,52
I thought I was done with my
awkward phase when "Vice"


17
0:0:28,52 --> 0:0:31,2
hired me to write about
politics, culture, and other


18
0:0:31,2 --> 0:0:33,69
important world affairs, which
should make me cool.


19
0:0:33,69 --> 0:0:34,93
But it doesn't.


20
0:0:34,93 --> 0:0:37,7

who creeps people out.

23
0:0:45,33 --> 0:0:46,84
HARRY: This is Daniel.


24
0:0:46,84 --> 0:0:48,86
He was in the Israeli
army for 10 years.


25
0:0:48,86 --> 0:0:51,66
And he lives and breathes
Krav Maga.


26
0:0:51,66 --> 0:0:53,2
And this is me.


27
0:0:53,2 --> 0:0:54,4
I'm not very manly or tough.


28
0:0:54,4 --> 0:0:55,69
And I mainly deal with conflict


29
0:0:55,69 --> 0:0:57,5
through nervous laughter.


30
0:0:57,5 --> 0:0:58,64
But I wanted to change
all of that.


31
0:0:58,64 --> 0:1:1,76
And because Daniel is such a
walking testosterone machine,


32
0:1:1,76 --> 0:1:3,95
I thought I could learn some
martial arts from him and


33
0:1:3,95 --> 0:1:6,85
hoped his massive manliness
rubbed off on me.

defend myself against being

really a problem right


40
0:1:18,85 --> 0:1:19,7

41
0:1:19,7 --> 0:1:21,27
Sounds very intense.


42
0:1:21,27 --> 0:1:22,49
Hopefully nothing bad happens.


43
0:1:22,49 --> 0:1:23,64
And I don't get hurt too much.

HARRY: First, we did some cardio
warm ups, which just


49
0:1:32,41 --> 0:1:34,83
helped remind me how
out of shape I was.


50
0:1:34,83 --> 0:1:36,93
Most of my classmates were tough
guys who looked like


51
0:1:36,93 --> 0:1:39,555
they hung out in saunas and
boxing gyms all the time and


52
0:1:39,555 --> 0:1:41,14
had balls the size of beets.

0:1:41,14 --> 0:1:43,58
Even the one woman there was
more manly than I was.

still early.

Just try not to fall down,
that's what I'm trying to do.


61
0:1:56,34 --> 0:1:58,28
Then, all of a sudden,
it was time for the


62
0:1:58,28 --> 0:1:59,116
punching and kicking.


63
0:1:59,116 --> 0:2:2,21
Punching and kicking, in case
you've never experienced it,


64
0:2:2,21 --> 0:2:4,79
is no fun and it hurts a lot.


65
0:2:4,79 --> 0:2:6,32
But we kept doing it anyway.

to remember just punching.

while they pummeled me.

0:2:15,29 --> 0:2:18,29
So it was like being in a club,
only instead of dancing,


71
0:2:18,29 --> 0:2:19,99
I was getting beat up.


72
0:2:19,99 --> 0:2:21,45

a little less

ended, I was ready to stop

0:2:41,34 --> 0:2:42,57

the kicking.

JOE: OK.


213
0:6:20,71 --> 0:6:24,5
But I have a lot of youngster
and old, retired people who


214
0:6:24,5 --> 0:6:26,24
pretty much are more comfortable
with the gun.

for first timers?

JOE: I'm not saying it
happens to everybody.


229
0:6:42,8 --> 0:6:47,265
There are some people who just
come and pick it up, and some

really fun and awesome.


237

I also learned that shooting
small pink things going really


238
0:7:0,4 --> 0:7:2,73
fast is incredibly difficult.


239
0:7:2,73 --> 0:7:5,18
If a small pink thing attacks
me at high speed,

0:7:5,18 --> 0:7:6,65
I'm probably fucked.

But if a person attacks me, I
think I'm going to be a little

more confident because I've
got my Krav Maga skills--


243
0:7:12,18 --> 0:7:13,61
that was a punch.


244
0:7:13,61 --> 0:7:16,22
Actually, now that I think about
it, if someone attacks


245
0:7:16,22 --> 0:7:21,21
me, I'm probably just going to
run away or get beat up.
