###65 Just don't get nervous.
###67 
###72 MALE SPEAKER: Ahh, right on the pad.
###75 MALE SPEAKER: Eddy!
###77 Was it fun?
###78 MALE SPEAKER: He doesn't remember.
###79 He missed most of the jump.
###81 MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.
###82 
###85 MALE SPEAKER: Smiling all the way down.
###87 
###102 FREDDY CORBIN: Go nuts.
###102 You can pull all my videos off the shelf.
###107 Here's some water.
###109 I need some for work.
###111 Here.
###113 Now he's going to want this.
###116 Go ahead.
###117 It's cheap.
###118 Now this is a cool photo.
###121 This is doing the last tattoo at Realistic.
###125 That's Howie the Cosmic Commander.
###127 This would probably be about June or May of '91.
###132 And you'll recognize those screens in the tattoo time.
###135 Realistic Studio was opened up in '74.
###138 I had the honor of working there in '90 and '91.
###141 And what it was was Ed went over to Japan after hanging
###145 out with Jerry in Hawaii and stuff, and when he came back
###149 he wanted to open up, basically, the United States'
###152 first appointment only non walk-in tattoo shop.
###158 There was no sign.
###159 You couldn't see it from the street.
###162 That's where Bob Roberts worked.
###165 Greg Irons worked there.
###166 Phillip sat in there.
###167 Leo Zulueta worked there.
###170 What happened was, Realistic, the lease was coming up, and
###174 Eddy wanted to move to San Francisco.
###177 And we wanted to work together, but we didn't want
###179 to work in that back room format.
###182 We wanted a walk-in tattoo shop.
###185 We, basically, were going to open up a shop and we were
###188 going to hire Igor Mortis and Dan Higgs, and that's where
###192 the whole Temple Dude tattoo came from.
###195 Because we were going to work a convention, I think in New
###197 Orleans together, but we weren't going to really be
###199 able to talk about the shop yet.
###201 But we felt, out of respect, we should go to Ed first and
###204 ask Ed if he wanted to own the shop.
###207 And we were driving across the Bay Bridge he actually brought
###211 it up, so what are you going to do Fred?
###213 Your lease is coming up.
###213 I been wanting to talk you about that.
###215 I got this idea.
###216 He drove from the bridge to Columbus and was like, this is
###221 where I wanted to open up when I first got back.
###224 And the next morning he had the place rented.
###228 That's how he operates.
###229 He just gets shit done.
###231 So we opened up Tattoo City on July 1 of '91, and I worked
###237 there till about '96.
###240 If I were to be really truthful, it was really
###242 difficult working with Eddy Deutsche and Ed Hardy, because
###245 I had only been tattooing a few years.
###248 And Eddy was amazing from the gate.
###251 And Ed Hardy was the best tattooer in the world.
###254 Like living in a fishbowl.
###256 We opened up Tattoo City and people are coming in and just
###259 expecting me to be able to--
###260 I want a back piece of this, and I want this.
###262 And I wasn't ready to do big tattoos like that yet.
###265 There were some that I could do.
###266 I could do a big Jesus head back piece or a big rock of
###270 ages maybe because they were simple enough.
###272 But I couldn't do wind bars or Japanese water back then, and
###275 stuff like that.
###276 I still had to learn how to do all that stuff.
###278 I did feel a lot of pressure, to be honest, to be able to do
###282 anything because I worked for Ed Hardy at Tattoo City.
###287 I think a big dynamic of one of the reasons that I got into
###290 drugs even was because there was so much pressure.
###295 I never got into heroin and stuff because I
###296 had a career going.
###298 Like, I work for Ed Hardy.
###300 I didn't take this shit lightly.
###302 I'd start popping Valiums at the end of the day.
###306 And I'll say, it kind of helped for a while, because
###310 you're working all day and you're tattooing somebody,
###313 that's a pretty serious thing.
###314 You know what I mean?
###315 It's not like a haircut.
###316 It doesn't grow back.
###317 And I remember the first time I used to--
###319 this was before cable--
###320 I used to love David Letterman.
###322 And I'd watch David Letterman and I remember smoking a joint
###326 and taking a couple Valiums and feeling that feeling, that
###330 kind of calmness and serenity.
###332 Like, oh, wow.
###333 This feels really good.
###335 And I got into--
###337 when I started getting my ribs tattooed I started taking some
###340 dilaudids and some morphine pills.
###342 And my brother, unfortunately at the time, was getting into
###346 heroin and using heroin.
###347 And there was nobody shooting up, there was no junkies
###350 hanging around, it was like, let's just buy a little bit
###353 and smoke it on some foil.
###354 And it seemed at the time, not innocent, but not harmful.
###359 It didn't seem as harmful as it really was.
###362 And ironically Ed had given me a month off because I was
###365 doing so good.
###367 I mean, we had closed Realistic and opened up Tattoo
###371 City and I was working my ass off.
###374 He said, Freddy, you've been doing so good.
###377 You should take a month off, dude.
###379 And that was the month I got strung out.
###382 Because I just laid around my house and covered the windows
###386 and slept for-- would just go into my room and not come out.
###391 And I would try the 90 meetings in 90 days thing.
###395 It's just not me.
###396 And then I would go through periods of just
###398 giving up even trying.
###401 I had gone to Amsterdam and I was living in the Red Light
###403 District and I was using a lot.
###405 And some crazy shit went down.
###407 My brother got in a car accident.
###409 My brother was a paraplegic.
###412 I called Ed and let him know what was going on and that's
###415 kind of when I got canned at Tattoo City and stuff.
###417 I wanted to tell Ed that I was strung out because I really,
###419 really respected him.
###420 But Ed's business.
###422 So I always knew that Ed would be like, well, Freddy, I love
###424 ya and I appreciate you telling me but you gotta go.
###427 And I was fine with that.
###429 But I wanted to kind of go to him--
###431 it sounds silly in retrospect--
###432 but I wanted to kind of get clean and then go to Ed and
###435 say here's what's been going on.
###436 But in the midst of my grandiose plan of trying to do
###440 this and figure out all this crazy shit, because it's like
###443 you're getting caught up in a shit storm.
###447 He basically canned me.
###448 And then, from what my mom tells me and Eddy and stuff,
###452 that he was really concerned at first.
###454 It was like, what are we going to do?
###455 We gotta get him into rehab.
###456 But by the time I was walking through the gate, he was
###459 yelling at me and screaming at me and all kinds of shit.
###462 So I think he just got kind of angry.
###466 Then it was like all eyes on me.
###468 Around the world.
###469 What's Freddy going to do kind of shit.
###473 It's just really good gossip.
###475 That's pretty much it.
###477 It's like, I think there's a couple dynamics.
###482 There's it's great gossip.
###484 There's the hater aspect.
###485 And then there's the concerned friend aspect of it, too.
###489 There were people that really loved me that were
###490 concerned about me.
###492 There were a lot of people that were stoked.
###495 I don't mean stoked to see me go down, but
###497 like, I had '66 Chevelle.
###500 I was young, I was making money, I was
###502 working for Ed Hardy.
###503 I was kind of rolling.
###505 JASON MCAFEE: I don't really know if I think that's the way
###508 people wanted to see it go for Freddy.
###510 Even though he might say that, I don't really think so.
###513 I think people love him and never really want to be like,
###516 yeah, fucking Freddy's fucked up.
###517 Or Freddy fuckin' blah, blah.
###519 I think that could be his own little thing
###521 going on with him.
###524 I didn't know about the Tattoo City thing, and why he got
###527 fired, or the stuff with him and Ed, or drugs or whatever
###533 had been going on with him.
###535 He was very open about it.
###536 He's a very open person, and was very like, hey, man, just
###540 want you to know, this is what's happened and
###542 you might get shit.
###543 And people are always going to be like, oh, Freddy Corbin
###546 because he's messed up or whatever.
###548 But he's been through some bad shit.
###551 People dying, his brother getting in an accident and
###554 being paralyzed, his brother dying recently.
###557 Things just with his whole life.
###559 Like, he's had a pretty rough run.
###561 And he's come out on top and been amazing.
###565 There's something about him, that his soul and his heart is
###567 just so genuine and so real.
###569 And no matter if he was drugs or not or weed or whatever the
###573 fuck he was doing, there's this part of him that you just
###576 care about and I love no matter what.
###578 FREDDY CORBIN: Of course I wanted to do the right thing,
###580 whatever that was.
###581 So I got off dope.
###584 I stayed clean for a little while, but not long.
###587 And then I ended up going back to Amsterdam and kind of just
###591 bailing the whole scene.
###593 I continued to use in Amsterdam for a while, and
###596 even here in Oakland for a little bit, and then just
###598 wasn't happy.
###599 It just wasn't working for me.
###601 Just staying well and just darkness,
###604 just living in darkness.
###606 So my friend Vinny was always really cool about being really
###611 supportive in a non-judgmental kind of way, was always there
###616 for me as a friend.
###618 And even my wife Lisa, who was then my girlfriend, as
###622 stubborn as we both can be, and as much as we're on
###627 opposite ends of the spectrum when it comes to things like
###631 religion or going to India or shit like that, she was always
###635 there for me, too.
###636 So the two of them are really instrumental in me kind of
###639 getting my shit together.
###641 LISA CORBIN: A lot of us have gone
###642 through the similar things.
###643 It is helpful to have other people because they can kind
###646 of call you on your shit.
###648 But there are times when we were all just
###650 like, what can we do?
###652 At a loss.
###654 And there are times with Freddy that were very scary.
###661 Knowing Freddy has been a journey, and sometimes I've
###664 had to hold on with the tightest ropes I've ever had
###669 to hold on to in my entire life.
###672 And I go through all that doubt of, what am I doing?
###676 Am I crazy?
###678 But there was always something there.
###679 There's always that bond.
###681 There was always that connection.
###683 And it's just been amazing to see him pull through that.
###689 There must have been something deep down that
###690 made him want to live.
###691 And then we have Sonny, our awesome son.
###694 And he's just sort of taken, I think, some of that energy and
###699 put it into him and they have a beautiful relationship.
###704 Makes me jealous sometimes.
###706 FREDDY CORBIN: [HUMMING]
###709 Ready for the dip?
###710 Can you dip?
###714 Oh, that's the sound.
###716 I guess you do the right thing, good things happened.
###719 Because I was always petrified of having a kid, because I had
###724 been strung out for so many years.
###725 So it was just like, I wouldn't be a good father.
###727 I could never do this or how would this work?
###731 The two things that petrified me the most were getting clean
###734 and having a kid.
###735 And I eventually was able to get clean.
###737 
###740 Sonny, my son, has just been the coolest thing in my life.
###744 Because I think when we were talking earlier, I said I
###747 could have never imagined having a kid, and I can't even
###750 imagine what it would be like to not have him.
###753 And I named him after Sonny, kind of.
###756 But Sonny was such a notorious fuck-up, Sonny Tufts, that it
###760 was like, did you name him after Sonny?
###762 Well, not really.
###765 I really just kind of learned how much I loved that name and
###768 how endearing it was to me because of my friend and
###771 because of knowing him so long and stuff like that.
###774 JASON MCAFEE: I tell him all the time.
###775 I'm just like, dude, from when I met you to now, it's insane.
###780 When I met him, he lived three blocks up in this dark,
###784 shitty, fuckin' depressing apartment.
###787 it was just this den of, like, you sat on a couch and you
###790 would melt in it and almost fall asleep.
###792 I would get there and just be like, 11:00 in the morning
###796 coming to work, and I was just--
###799 And just to see where he's come from to like, getting
###803 married, having a baby, owning the two successful shops.
###808 His house, his life, he's changed so, so much.
###813 And definitely, it's Sonny.
###815 Seeing him be a dad is unbelievable.
###818 I've never seen someone attack it so strongly and so
###822 passionately and become--
###824 
###828 he's a rad dad.
###829 
###832 FREDDY CORBIN: Look at you.
###833 There you go.
###834 Do it.
###836 Do it.
###838 Yes.
###839 Yay!
###841 Yeah.
###843 You conquered.
###846 TIM HENDRICKS: It's hard to tame a free spirit, and he's
###848 the ultimate free spirit.
###851 So I think this is one way of doing it organically and
###854 naturally, is having a kid and having a family.
###859 He's still Freddy.
###860 Nothing changed about him.
###862 I admire people like that.
###864 He's an extremely fun time.
###867 Freddy could have fun in a cardboard box.
###870 MAX SCHAAF: The weirdest thing to me is, he
###872 goes to Burning Man.
###873 And he's like, it was insane, bro.
###876 And I never want to go to Burning Man.
###878 I just don't have any desire to, but when Freddy tells you
###881 about it you're like, what?
###882 What?
###883 Oh my god, really?
###885 Because he's just that cool.
###888 FREDDY CORBIN: I feel like Burning Man prepared me for
###890 India, because at Burning Man, anything goes.
###895 You could be talking to some really cool fuckin' people
###898 that are just really down, and the next thing you know you've
###901 got some crazy dude tripping on acid who's flailing and not
###905 knowing where the fuck he is, or whatever,
###908 because there's no rules.
###910 And India is the same way.
###912 India is no rules.
###914 We have this term.
###915 It's like, both and.
###917 It's profound, profane, and then a little bit more.
###923 India is so intense.
###925 You could see a dead person in the street.
###927 There's lepers.
###927 There's people begging.
###928 There's poor kids begging, running around
###931 with no pants on.
###932 There's just a lot of poverty.
###935 A cliche that people say is that India is the most
###938 beautiful and the most horrific place that
###940 you'll every go.
###941 And it's true.
###943 So you'll be out boating and you'll see a
###945 carcass floating by.
###949 A bloated human body will just--
###950 I've seen a dog with a hand in it's mouth cruising off like,
###954 I got some food.
###955 It's just bizarre.
###957 First time I was there, I was like, if I stayed at this one
###959 hotel, I could maybe bring Lisa and her mom here.
###964 Her mom's really cool.
###965 And I'm just like, why am I wasting my time trying to turn
###969 them on to something that I think is really cool?
###972 My wife has no desire to go to India.
###975 It's too dirty for her.
###976 She won't even go camping.
###978 If there's not a toilet, she's not interested.
###982 LISA CORBIN: Freddy's spiritual side is very
###984 separate from our relationship.
###985 It's not something that we share or do together.
###988 So his trips to India, or Burning Man, or Brazil, or the
###994 tea ceremonies, or the parties that he goes to, like the
###998 alchemy parties.
###1000 Freddy, I think, maybe got opened up to different things,
###1004 but I think he's always been a spiritual.
###1007 JASON MCAFEE: His spiritual side is, all over the place,
###1011 in a good way.
###1013 I think Freddy believes and dabbles in a little
###1016 bit of all of it.
###1019 There's obviously a lot Jesuses here and a lot of
###1021 Christian stuff and all this stuff.
###1022 And he even sometimes will say that's what he is and what he
###1025 does, is he's a Christian.
###1027 But he believes so much in Buddha and all these other
###1032 kinds of religions and forms of religion that I think he
###1035 takes pieces from all of it.
###1039 He's definitely got a lot of spirituality.
###1041 Wherever it comes from, I couldn't really pinpoint.
###1046 FREDDY CORBIN: I don't feel bound by any dogma of any
###1048 religion whatsoever.
###1049 And I consider myself a Christian because I'm down for
###1054 Jesus and I believe in what he was here for, as well as
###1059 Buddha or Martin Luther King or Gandhi or
###1063 anybody of that nature.
###1065 I'm just kind of into positive energy.
###1069 And I think we're all God's fuckin' children.
###1071 We're all brothers and sisters no matter what religious sect
###1074 or color or size or sex or whatever.
###1077 
###1081 Huh, Son?
###1083 And don't trust the government.
###1084 
###1090 LISA CORBIN: I think, actually, when Freddy's
###1092 brother passed away because of his involvement in his
###1097 spirituality, it really helped them through it.
###1100 Because I think that he was in a place where he was able to
###1104 accept it and felt that it was maybe the universe had
###1109 actually let things happen in a way that was best.
###1115 He handled it in a way, I think, that was the best--
###1122 I don't know.
###1124 He got through it and I think he got through it because of
###1127 what he believes in.
###1129 And it didn't send him over the edge, because a lot of
###1132 those things--
###1133 Freddy lives on the edge.
###1133 A lot of us have lived on the edge.
###1135 And it's one of those things.
###1137 Death can be one of those things that
###1138 might put you there.
###1140 FREDDY CORBIN: My brother was kind of a lone wolf.
###1142 I was one of his few friends so I decided to do his funeral
###1147 on the Ganges, just take his ashes to India and do it
###1151 there, do his little funeral there.
###1154 And it's-- they call it a puja.
###1158 So you do a puja for the dead and then you do a puja for the
###1161 people that you love that are alive.
###1164 And so the first day was a lot of burning, and certain
###1166 incense and smoke and stuff.
###1170 And then the ones for your living loved ones, a lot of
###1174 flowers, water.
###1175 The living day one, I had to hold this pitcher of water
###1180 over the shiva lingam, which is basically like a penis and
###1183 vagina statue.
###1184 It represents fertility and the cycle of life.
###1188 I had to pour this huge pitcher of water over it.
###1191 They fill it up and then I'd have to hold it.
###1193 And then they fill it up again.
###1195 And by the third time, I'm kind of holding my arm.
###1198 I came home and I said to Lisa-- because she had been
###1200 wanting to get pregnant for a while.
###1202 I came home and I said to Lisa, I said, well, if you're
###1205 ever going to get pregnant, it's going to happen now,
###1207 babe, because I had to hold this penis water thing over
###1210 these flowers.
###1211 And I was just kind of joking about it.
###1213 And she said, well, if I get pregnant, I'll turn Hindu.
###1219 She literally said that.
###1220 And right after we got married and got locked into this
###1223 house, she turns up pregnant.
###1226 And I'm convinced that definitely helped.
###1231 I'm not saying that was the cause of it.
###1234 Obviously, sperm had a lot to do with it.
###1236 But I think stuff like that helps, and my beliefs.
###1241 That intention is a big part of anything that we do.
###1243 
###1247 Peel it.
###1249 
###1251 All right.
###1252 That was cool.
