1
0:0:0,13 --> 0:0:7,49
wilcox county high school in georgia has
not hack and racially integrated com


2
0:0:7,49 --> 0:0:8,589
unbelievable added


3
0:0:8,589 --> 0:0:13,789
says twenty lectures with a wet places
like the executive branch there has to


4
0:0:13,789 --> 0:0:17,869
different problems they have a white
prague event so-called into racially


5
0:0:17,869 --> 0:0:21,929
integrated probable suites where you
know the black students have their prom


6
0:0:21,929 --> 0:0:24,69
right in the cool like it to go


7
0:0:24,69 --> 0:0:27,769
drown me at some something clan


8
0:0:27,769 --> 0:0:30,789
and now what's happening right now is
our forces that are fighting there


9
0:0:30,789 --> 0:0:33,1
they're trying to raising money


10
0:0:33,1 --> 0:0:35,85
to have a racially integrated trial
because what the high school does is


11
0:0:35,85 --> 0:0:38,26
they don't have their own probably have


12
0:0:38,26 --> 0:0:39,47
private parties


13
0:0:39,47 --> 0:0:41,699
provide for a prom okay


14
0:0:41,699 --> 0:0:42,649
so hot


15
0:0:42,649 --> 0:0:48,59
parents add maybe some members of staff
knows they provide funding for you know


16
0:0:48,59 --> 0:0:52,329
white prom and then the other prom on it
since they're privately funded the


17
0:0:52,329 --> 0:0:55,46
school really doesn't have much say in
terms of what happened switched back i


18
0:0:55,46 --> 0:0:59,429
think is the as if it's a prom that's
tied to your students you should not


19
0:0:59,429 --> 0:1:4,22
allow any any type of segregation it of
course and so


20
0:1:4,22 --> 0:1:7,47
the other problem obvious is not really
racially integrated because they're


21
0:1:7,47 --> 0:1:9,469
having to raise money for a whole
different


22
0:1:9,469 --> 0:1:13,0
racially integrated products another
headed have three props


23
0:1:13,0 --> 0:1:16,119
if your wife there you go to all three
of us kind of cool


24
0:1:16,119 --> 0:1:19,99
kid dependent now seriously getting him
and


25
0:1:19,99 --> 0:1:23,509
i'm and literally have trouble reading
the story okay so there's a lot of news


26
0:1:23,509 --> 0:1:27,2
of our i want to show that see you guys
to and because it'll give you some more


27
0:1:27,2 --> 0:1:28,26
detail than


28
0:1:28,26 --> 0:1:32,2
how it works and what happened to one
o'clock sitemap dot that's the issue


29
0:1:32,2 --> 0:1:35,909
left to the white from looks at their
world full-color wilcox county has


30
0:1:35,909 --> 0:1:38,85
caused those people who says black and
white


31
0:1:38,85 --> 0:1:42,49
there the white prominent had a
annotated prompted n erased other than


32
0:1:42,49 --> 0:1:45,42
cartesian tries to and the white brown


33
0:1:45,42 --> 0:1:49,12
they would probably have a policeman and
well-prepared


34
0:1:49,12 --> 0:1:53,25
that was the case just last year as a
biracial student was turned away by


35
0:1:53,25 --> 0:1:57,84
police it's been away for as long as
anyone can remember it doesn't stop it


36
0:1:57,84 --> 0:1:58,87
from


37
0:1:58,87 --> 0:2:1,83
homecoming is almost everyday


38
0:2:1,83 --> 0:2:3,98
and the homecoming king queen


39
0:2:3,98 --> 0:2:7,46
one the one was more than one this year
for the first time in and out of black


40
0:2:7,46 --> 0:2:9,42
and a black man away what


41
0:2:9,42 --> 0:2:12,919
it was a black and white and black


42
0:2:12,919 --> 0:2:16,93
and they were uh... they were allowed to
pictures two for the year but


43
0:2:16,93 --> 0:2:18,709
harmonica


44
0:2:18,709 --> 0:2:22,1
so that when people say race in this guy


45
0:2:22,1 --> 0:2:24,59
now look have we made progress


46
0:2:24,59 --> 0:2:27,779
of course we have this is an would have
described entire herself


47
0:2:27,779 --> 0:2:31,59
you know forty fifty years ago


48
0:2:31,59 --> 0:2:34,46
that goes to show it wasn't that long
ago that


49
0:2:34,46 --> 0:2:36,299
because we still have remnants of it


50
0:2:36,299 --> 0:2:39,969
in twenty thirteen this storm playing
this


51
0:2:39,969 --> 0:2:43,16
the fact of the activities in that town
have put up with it


52
0:2:43,16 --> 0:2:47,11
you know is amazing i mean obviously not
want to know that we could escorted out


53
0:2:47,11 --> 0:2:48,1
of the dalai


54
0:2:48,1 --> 0:2:49,18
but cars


55
0:2:49,18 --> 0:2:53,979
but if ever there was a time to call and
then double a_c_p_ et cetera this is a


56
0:2:53,979 --> 0:2:57,909
that they have a little story keep the
black kids from goldman were probably


57
0:2:57,909 --> 0:3:1,359
just go to the white promptly ended this
year


58
0:3:1,359 --> 0:3:5,719
but you did you get the police com the
political complicated story allow what


59
0:3:5,719 --> 0:3:6,58
charge


60
0:3:6,58 --> 0:3:10,1
and by the way of thinking about whether
black people in that time to get a fair


61
0:3:10,1 --> 0:3:10,789
shake


62
0:3:10,789 --> 0:3:14,709
on other matters act let alone when it
comes to the police those police are


63
0:3:14,709 --> 0:3:18,1
escorting a black is for the prompt even
imagine they turn around and say


64
0:3:18,1 --> 0:3:22,359
although no i'm not gonna pull the plug
of respondents


65
0:3:22,359 --> 0:3:25,49
or do you think they make certain
assumptions about coordinated since


66
0:3:25,49 --> 0:3:29,68
as a candidate the regular fare sort of
it's formats of the school this is a


67
0:3:29,68 --> 0:3:32,939
well into the while the school is no
official stance on that


68
0:3:32,939 --> 0:3:38,309
does the have travis and definitely do
have an official stance have to have one


69
0:3:38,309 --> 0:3:41,49
uh... but another point that i wanted to
make


70
0:3:41,49 --> 0:3:43,869
the fact that you don't we talk about


71
0:3:43,869 --> 0:3:48,239
institutional racism and we talk about
certain uh... obstacles that a black


72
0:3:48,239 --> 0:3:52,229
people have to go through just to become
successful and one thing that we


73
0:3:52,229 --> 0:3:56,99
unfortunately get the chance to talk
about earlier this week was a study that


74
0:3:56,99 --> 0:4:0,359
was done on uh... networking and how lot
of times


75
0:4:0,359 --> 0:4:3,81
people who are c_e_o_'s are managers are
owners of companies


76
0:4:3,81 --> 0:4:8,3
uh... art typically white and when we do
they do favors for their boyfriends and


77
0:4:8,3 --> 0:4:11,77
those are the people that usually get
hired into their companies so bill


78
0:4:11,77 --> 0:4:13,399
redeker position with


79
0:4:13,399 --> 0:4:16,66
uh... robert johnson who said who was
that had it bt


80
0:4:16,66 --> 0:4:18,9
than i thought was a really


81
0:4:18,9 --> 0:4:19,669
interesting


82
0:4:19,669 --> 0:4:22,27
but rogers amends process from a
conservative


83
0:4:22,27 --> 0:4:26,3
but i thought his answer served or other
words replicating said any mentioned


84
0:4:26,3 --> 0:4:28,21
just that point it it's not


85
0:4:28,21 --> 0:4:31,89
even malicious nine if you are exactly
you know if you're a regular guy your


86
0:4:31,89 --> 0:4:33,739
carpenter were you when i'm here


87
0:4:33,739 --> 0:4:37,129
and for that one of the job opens up the
you know


88
0:4:37,129 --> 0:4:38,24
carpenter position


89
0:4:38,24 --> 0:4:41,239
your son your nephew jesus you know


90
0:4:41,239 --> 0:4:44,73
that would help okay although he kinda
left i know


91
0:4:44,73 --> 0:4:46,35
say i'm not sure is a great carbon


92
0:4:46,35 --> 0:4:49,189
may be happy to know


93
0:4:49,189 --> 0:4:51,44
and so that's just the way it works here
in a union


94
0:4:51,44 --> 0:4:54,639
and so one of the reasons you need
affirmative action was to break through


95
0:4:54,639 --> 0:4:56,33
that national barrier


96
0:4:56,33 --> 0:4:58,61
that was a demon s early malicious


97
0:4:58,61 --> 0:5:4,9
okay now this in georgia is malicious
prepared by the way law that either


98
0:5:4,9 --> 0:5:5,269
watched


99
0:5:5,269 --> 0:5:7,75
yet over the course of course pack a day


100
0:5:7,75 --> 0:5:10,84
but even now i'm just saying that right
here is that you know i'll give you know


101
0:5:10,84 --> 0:5:14,74
the we work with your friends yet and if
you have no exposed anybody else's gonna


102
0:5:14,74 --> 0:5:17,529
keep perpetuating the situation


103
0:5:17,529 --> 0:5:19,949
and it's amazing to in another


104
0:5:19,949 --> 0:5:22,39
blaming the victim he don't get me wrong
but


105
0:5:22,39 --> 0:5:24,289
summation among people problems


106
0:5:24,289 --> 0:5:27,84
i know that it was incredible part of
the story and this has been going on for


107
0:5:27,84 --> 0:5:28,77
decades


108
0:5:28,77 --> 0:5:32,12
there'll they're like uh... talent
frozen in time


109
0:5:32,12 --> 0:5:36,599
innocent civilians are spread this story
and it has a proposal earlier this week


110
0:5:36,599 --> 0:5:39,24
when i first read i think this is an
april fool's joke sorry there's no


111
0:5:39,24 --> 0:5:40,45
question about it


112
0:5:40,45 --> 0:5:43,539
but now it's a real this is the kind of
suffered some having a country


113
0:5:43,539 --> 0:5:45,2
suffolk ip alike


114
0:5:45,2 --> 0:5:48,259
ignored it lacked and then just pretend
like we don't have any problems of


115
0:5:48,259 --> 0:7:48,259
racism
