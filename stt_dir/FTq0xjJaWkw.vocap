###44 I can't always explain my experiences in relation to the dogmas or doctrines of
###49 every faith, but as bad as some of these demons are, which they are very, very serious
###54 and they are by far so rabid in this world. It's almost impossible to even explain.
###68 One night I was given to go over a particular US city and the entire upper atmosphere was
###75 filled with so many demons it was almost impossible to get through it... and when I got through
###81 it I was exhausted for like two weeks, and it was a particular city where there was just
###86 really dominantly dark at that point, and so we have to recognize that much of what
###94 we believe to be true really isn't. There is more to what we're doing here than what
###100 we maybe want to deal with.
###108 I believe that this world that we're experiencing is,
###112 to put it kindly, small potatoes. It's like a little experience that God has given us for our
###121 benefit and edification and our spiritual development. This is not graduate school by
###129 any means. It's more like nursery school. When I asked Jesus, 'Is this like elementary
###138 school? He said no. And I said kindergarden? He goes no. And I said, "Nursery school?"
###142 And He says, "Mmm, like nursery school." The lessons of this world are avoid evil and love
###150 good, be kind to one another... these are not really difficult or intellectually challenging
###157 lessons that were learning down here and which plenty of people are failing to learn.
###162 It's possible that if you are not progressing properly in this realm that you could go backwards
###167 but that's usually for people who are engaging in seriously destructive things. Dominantly
###176 dark and evil would be people who are engaging in murder, rape... serious, serious acts against
###185 life, because the way energy is perceived in the mystical realms is acts for or against
###191 life. And so to go into the dominantly dark and evil realms you would have to do some
###198 pretty bad stuff. However, just having the issues of vanity and lust could put you in
###206 a lower realm.
###210 This is just a small portion of what I was shown, it's called the universal
###214 sphere of realms. We are in here... this is the third realm and this is the fourth realm.
###219 This fourth realm is the astral plane. This third realm would be a third dimensional reality
###225 which we reside on. In the very center is the first realm which, as you can see, is
###230 totally black - that's total darkness, that's where pure evil resides. The second realm
###235 is where dominant darkness resides. When you're dealing with realms one and two, you're dealing
###240 with purgatories and hell realms - both of these are even lower realms than we are. And
###246 when you're dealing with three and four you're dealing with purgatories and people who are
###250 trying to reach beyond into realms five and above, which go out into higher and higher
###256 gradations of light. But these four realms together make up what is called the border
###261 worlds - the underworlds - and so the reason why this is important is because if you understand
###267 this is where we are... and God is somewhere way out there, than what I'm going to try
###273 to describe and explain makes a lot more sense.
###277 When we die, we human beings have no power
###279 to ascend or descend spiritually. We are taken by guides... who could be either angels or
###292 demons... to what we carry in our hearts. If we carry hate in our hearts we go to a world of
###301 hate, and if we carry love in our hearts we're carried to world of love.
###306 It's not good enough just to be nice, to speak nicely and have a seething mind filled with eros
###312 and thanatos. Because when you die, it's that seething mind that will carry your spiritual
###316 gene into places where seething beings live... and you don't want to go in seething places.
###322 In the mystical realms you see what is called the energetic truth about a person
###327 or another being or a spirit. In the physical realm we can all disguise ourselves in any
###335 way that we choose. We can be a wolf in sheep's clothing in the physical realm, but when
###341 you're in the mystical realm what you really are is what people see.
###346 And there's no deception and there's no fooling around. You can't get out of it.
###353 You can say, "I don't want this." Well, that ain't going to do you any good because
###357 you spent your whole life building your heart. What we are doing here in this world
###363 is building a heart of love or building a heart that's not love.
###368 We have to become more like God in order to go to a higher place.
###374 We go where we're compatible, as depressing as that may be.
###383 I remember many times that the angels would
###386 show me, "How would you save a world that serves its function to perfection?" And I
###392 would say, "What you do mean?" And they would say, "The mortal realms are where the battles
###398 between good and evil rage. They rage around you, they rage inside of you. This world
###405 is functioning to perfection." The purpose of being in a mortal realm is to become aware
###411 of that interior process that has to begin, of purification, and that's when we start
###417 understanding... we understand that the goal is God.
###423 If you leave your mind filled with
###425 unconscious drives of greed and hatred, eros and thanatos, then they will drive you into
###430 bad life forms. So the whole goal in a contemplative culture is to go into the unconscious and
###435 become conscious of it, and to cleanse yourself of the negative, ego-centered, ignorance-dominated
###442 drives. Like 'I want this' or 'I hate that.'
###445 Why is it so important to purify the soul?
###448 Because that's the true you; that's who you are. Most people get caught
###452 up with how they look, or they look at the vehicle that carries the self. It's just
###458 like the person who wants to get a nice body. They go to Gold's Gym and they lift the
###464 weights and they do the push-ups and the sit-ups and all these kinds of things. So now, you
###468 do all of that so that you can have a beautiful body, and what do you do for the inside? So
###472 there's work that you have to do on the inside so that you can make sure that you
###477 get rid of those vices.
###478 One of the things I've learned in the spiritual realms is that
###481 a thought of vice is actually what gives dominion for a demon of that vice to come in and be
###490 around you. So let's say you have a greedy thought... that is enough grounds for a demon
###498 to come around and start suggesting things to you. If you have the opposite thought where
###503 you want to be charitable to somebody... that also gives the same permission for an angel
###510 of that virtue to come in and be around you, as well. And this is where you begin understanding
###516 the battle that goes on around us.
###519 We've all seen these movies in which you've got a good
###524 angel and a demon sitting on someone's shoulders saying, "Go ahead and do this, no, go ahead
###529 and do that." Pulling the dark side and the bright side of us sort of thing. It's the
###534 truth. As we sit here right now there are myriads of angels and myriads of demons, there's
###542 light and darkness that's constantly vying for our soul.
###546 The best way to always describe
###549 what a demon is... is something that was cast out, tossed down here on earth, into hell,
###555 the pit, whatever you want to call it, and it's to wreak havoc, to undo everything on
###561 a positive level, to be able to break down people, to break down their life structures
###566 and to do things on a totally negative level.
###569 In order to begin purifying and begin getting
###572 rid of some of our vices, we have to start behaving differently and thinking differently
###578 because if you understand that when you have a simple thought of greed or a simple
###582 thought of vanity, you're giving dominion for a dark force to be around you and influencing
###587 your thoughts, then you become more and more aware of how much more vigilance you have
###596 to keep over your mind, heart, and soul so that you are progressing.
###600 Those that want to change have to first change the way they think. If you don't change it, you can
###605 dress up a certain way and it seems like everything is okay... a person could, even a Muslim, he
###611 can learn so many verses from the Koran, he can stop eating pork, he can fast in the month
###617 of Ramadan, but if he or she have not changed the way they think, then their behavior is
###624 going to be the same. They might camouflage it for a while, but then when they get back
###629 into the environment, the same thinking is there, so the behavior is going to come right back.
###640 St. Francis was gathered in the field with some of his brothers right outside of
###646 a small town in Umbria and there was a fellow who had the ability to see demons. And as
###653 he stood in this field he saw legions of demons as far as he could see that were lined up
###661 in the field who were just plotting as to how to tempt these Franciscan Friars. Then
###668 he walks down the street to the entrance to the town and there's one old demon sitting
###674 there yawning, leaning back by the side of the entrance to the town, and he went to
###679 one of the Franciscan Friars and he said, "Brother, I've been given this gift to be
###684 able to see these things. Why are there millions of demons here with you twenty in the field and
###690 only one by the gate that's filled with all these people," And he said, "Because all that's
###696 needed is one little old demon in order to bring those people to perdition... but the
###703 devil has to work very hard in order to tempt those who have given their lives completely to God."
###712 What you have to understand is that there's a continual warfare that goes on for
###717 every soul on this earth. Much of the time when we're here on earth, we're thinking all
###721 the battles between good and evil are going on outside of us but we don't recognize that
###726 that battle is going on inside of us as well.
###729 Anything that's good, a demon or a devil will
###732 do in reverse. Now what do I mean by that? If a person is a good person and they go to
###736 church and they're trying to lead a halfway decent life... they will rebel against that,
###742 they'll try to break down that individual, wear that individual down to be able to get
###746 them to do mean, rotten types of things and create all kinds of havoc.
###752 What the forces of darkness want us to do is to spend our life trying to grab for all the gusto that
###757 we can get. To get stuff, and to get things... and to treat people like things.
###766 There really is a purpose for us being here, and the purpose is not to live a worldly life, be
###774 successful and all this stuff. The purpose has to do with this purification process that God sent
###779 us to the mortal realms to overcome. But if you think about how brilliant this is of
###786 the dark side, if the dark side can get us to focus entirely on worldly things and
###794 waste our time... works for him, doesn't it? Because we waste an entire lifetime and accomplish nothing.
###801 Are demons clever? They are the most sophisticated, most cunning things you could
###807 ever deal with. Why? They have the wisdom of the ages. They have the knowledge of the
###813 ages. They know how to manipulate things. They know how to trick people. They know how
###817 to do things very, very... cunning is the best way I can describe it.
###823 Now usually what happens
###825 when people really turn their path towards God is that they will begin what will become
###832 almost a real warfare for their soul. And a lot of people are really surprised by this.
###838 But as long as we're kind of content and lackadaisical about just living life and not doing anything,
###845 the demons and Satan already has dominion over us, so they don't have to make themselves
###852 known. But when we turn away and we start saying, "We want God," then they have to fight for us.
###859 The more spiritual an individual is, the more they pray, the more that they
###864 are into their belief system, the more of a target that individual actually can be.
###871 Because trying to win a very spiritual individual over - no matter what denomination you're
###877 talking about... that's like the grand prize.
###880 But you have to push through this warfare,
###882 you cannot back down. Because that's their goal, is that they want to wear you down
###886 so you're so tired you're like, "This is too hard, I'm just going to go back to my
###890 lackadaisical lifestyle, nothing bothered me then."
###893 I think it's probably wise to
###895 admit this about ourselves and our society that evil is real, people are not always
###900 going to be good or do good. And to be open to the idea that some of those forces of evil
###906 just as the forces of good may be invisible, and that whether one calls it a
###911 devil or not is maybe less important than realizing that there are evils that we cannot
###917 see, evils that are spiritual that we only partially grasp, and we should be humbled
###922 before reality, that we don't control the good, we don't control the evil, and
###927 there may be forces around us that can hurt us and help us and we have to find our way between them.
###932 The most powerful thing against the demons in any of the spheres is - I'm
###937 going to say something that the exorcists usually say - which is confession. The sacrament of
###942 confession is, according to many exorcists, more powerful than the rite of exorcism, but
###948 in my experience in the mystical realms... the reason that's the case is because by confessing
###952 your sins, you are taking away the dominion that they have. They have dominion because
###958 of your agreement to certain sins or vices or ways of thinking.
###964 You are your catalyst.
###966 That's the best way I can describe that to you. You are in control of your vessel. You
###972 have to fight back. You have to protect yourself. And the way I recommend to anybody is
###978 I don't care if you worship a 5 pound quartz crystal. I don't care what it is. As long
###983 as it's on a positive. You call upon that positive to be able to help protect yourself...
###989 and you have to fight back.
###995 In regards to some of the demons associated with the deadly sins,
###999 there is a demon of rage... and it's interesting because the demon of rage operates
###1006 and appears very much like a person who has an uncontrollable rage issue. It's a small
###1012 little snake, and you can see it in the mystical realm, but when it becomes energized it becomes
###1020 huge, red, pumping with fury, and you've got to get out of it's way... and so that's
###1028 one of the demons of rage.
###1032 Narcissism, which is an aspect of pride, and a lot of these
###1037 things are offshoots of the deadly sins, but like narcissism in particular there's a demon
###1042 called Gold Eyes. He's a very frightening demon. When he is inside the soul of a person
###1049 he will appear as this gold light coming through their eyes and he's so enraged... and it's
###1055 an imperialistic rage. It's like the rage that you would see from someone who feels
###1060 very entitled. When you get this creature to come out it's like a big raging wall of
###1067 fire... and that's narcissism and imperialistic rage.
###1074 The Gull demon is a demon of destructive
###1077 sexuality. The worst ones, which would be the incubus and the succubus, these are much
###1082 more higher caliber demons, they have a lot more strength and they can do a lot more damage
###1088 to a soul. These have to do with lust. You'll see them as very attractive but when they
###1093 reveal themselves they're like a skeleton with flesh hanging from it, spider webs... almost
###1099 like a corpse that's been decomposing. You know how it says in the scriptures somewhere,
###1106 "Outside they look one way and inside they're like a ravening wolf."
###1110 That's the way the demonic is.
###1114 One of the most important and most disturbing demons to mention is called
###1121 the Lord Demon, and one of the reasons it's so disturbing is because of its commonality.
###1128 Christ showed me this demon and I was so overwhelmed by the power of this demon... and then He showed
###1135 me... it was a real, real mortal battle to the death kind of thing. I mean, this demon
###1142 was really sneaky. The Lord Demon represents, more than anything, self-intelligence... so
###1149 you have to have the ego, you have to have the greed, and the avarice is anger that's
###1157 disordered. The Lord Demon is the most common demon in the world today because we're so
###1164 smart as human beings, we're so self-intelligent, that we're smarter than God, right? We want
###1170 the opinion of God, the opinion of the prophets, saints, mystics and sages from all time, to
###1177 be of equal value to every single one of us down here below. But in reality, it's not.
###1185 If you have to hold on to the self-intelligence that, "I'm right. This whole concept of demons
###1193 is illogical. The concept that God would not just love all His creatures no matter what
###1202 is illogical," then you're going to be visiting with the Lord Demon. And the Lord Demon, Jesus
###1209 Christ also told me, was the most common cause of damnation today. And that's interesting
###1215 because in Fatima in 1917, when the Blessed Virgin appeared to the three shepherd children,
###1222 she had said the most common reason for souls to go to hell at that time was sins of impurity.
###1229 But our society has become so arrogant
###1233 that we have become smarter than God. Think about that. Think about us down here in the
###1239 third and fourth realm, and God somewhere ad infinitum, and we believe that. That's
###1247 not going to allow us to grow. And the Lord Demon is so sneaky, all he has to do is convince
###1252 you that it's illogical... religion is illogical, the moral code is illogical, the ten commandments
###1259 are illogical. But if we think that we're smarter than the simple moral code, we think
###1266 that anything can be changed according to our simple whims, we become really vulnerable
###1274 to having a voice speaking inside of us telling us we're right, and it gets harder and harder
###1283 to get away from this one because the Lord Demon is really, really powerful. This is
###1287 not like some little pansy demon. This Lord Demon is a scary creature, and he will come
###1296 to you and when you see him in the mystical, when he becomes his true self, his teeth
###1300 are all pointy, he turns red and black and blood oozes from his pores and his teeth,
###1307 and there's flesh on his teeth... he's the most disgusting creature you'll ever see, but...
###1311 boy, is he good at what he does.
###1353 Before my experience with Jesus I was a successful,
###1357 A+, American guy, who believed that it's a dog-eat-dog world, life is about competition
###1366 and winning and not being a loser. Life is about not being the victim but being the aggressor
###1374 and I tried to bully my way in my relationships. I tried to intimidate people. I didn't hesitate
###1382 to physically assault people and verbally assault them. I did very well. I got
###1389 promotions, I got money, I got prestige, I got honors. I was a winner. I was very aggressive
###1398 with my wife, with my children. A lot of people despised me and I was glad of it because I
###1407 figured part of the quality of being a winner was that there were casualties in your relationships
###1412 along the way. And my friends were people that subscribed to the same sort of highly
###1418 assertive, self-centered, narcissistic, point of view. I believe that there is no such thing
###1427 as an atheist, I believe that everybody has a God. The only question is, "Who's your
###1432 god?" And for atheists, their god is themselves. So they have these little bitty gods, which
###1438 is their self, and that was me and my friends. We were all in love with ourselves and that's
###1443 who we worshipped. Having yourself as a god fails in a crisis because you have nobody
###1451 to turn to because you can't do anything about the circumstances, they're just collapsing
###1456 around you. I was dying in a hospital and it was catastrophic, and you have nothing
###1462 left but hopelessness and despair and a very fatalistic, nihilistic view of the world, that
###1469 life sucks and then you die and who cares. Which is pretty bleak when you think about it.
###1475 And that's what I was believing when I died on June 1, 1985 at 38 years old.
###1488 Your consciousness, when you die, doesn't
###1491 cease. That's the interesting thing is that consciousness survives bodily death. And so
###1497 when you have a negative consciousness you get to go into negative world... the world
###1504 where 'of like' people and like consciousness and it's a very cruel and brutal and horrible place.
###1513 It was much like what has been described as rats when they over-reproduce in too small
###1520 a cage and they just start gnawing on each other. That's what they were doing... basically
###1526 people biting, tearing, ripping each other apart continuously.
###1535 One of the things as a priest,
###1537 I've been a priest for 31 years, and one of the things that is the most wonderful
###1541 moment in the day is when at 2:30 in the morning you get a call to go to the hospital and somebody's
###1546 dying. At first you grumble that it's 2:30 in the morning - I got this 7 o'clock mass
###1552 tomorrow, I'm going to be tired all day, and you whine about that. And then you get up
###1559 and you go to the hospital. But when you're standing by that bed, and you look at everybody
###1565 standing around it, life is clearer and makes more sense at that moment than it does any
###1574 other time during the day. Because at that moment there's no one who dies saying, "I
###1582 wish I'd gotten more stuff. I wish I'd committed more sin. I wish I'd been more selfish."
###1589 They all die saying, "I wish I'd loved more."
###1597 I thought about my life, and as I thought
###1599 about my life I realized, since I'd been a teacher all my life, that somehow I'd missed
###1606 the whole point, that whatever the point of life was not only had I missed it but I
###1611 failed it. I'd failed to recognize what the course was about and I was clueless and whatever
###1618 I was supposed to have achieved I didn't achieve it because I ended up in this cesspool... this
###1624 horrible cesspool. And so obviously I was a big failure.
###1629 One of the beautiful things
###1631 about Hindu tradition is that God is very, very accommodating, God is very open to
###1634 adjustment and whatever way a human being happens to be heading or wandering, God is
###1641 able to go there and meet the person there. The example is given in some scriptures that
###1646 if we are seeking God in a very basic way, we're like little children running around
###1651 in the courtyard and God is like our mother who will find us wherever we are, both to
###1657 protect us from harm and to make us well.
###1660 We can trust that God's love and mercy will
###1663 overcome our sinfulness. And that's true whether we're the worst sinner in the world or whether
###1669 we've actually led a pretty decent God-fearing upright life of kindness and mercy and compassion.
###1676 That God's grace is what brings us into a right relationship with Him in the last analysis.
###1682 Yes, we respond by good works and so on and so forth, and all we have to do is simply
###1687 acknowledge that we need that grace.
###1689 After the people in darkness had devastated me and
###1693 emotionally, psychologically, spiritually had torn me down to nothing... I heard my voice
###1704 say, "Pray to God." And I thought I don't pray, I don't believe in God... that's what
###1711 I thought... and the voice said, "Pray to God." And I thought I don't know how to pray, I
###1717 don't pray. And the voice said, "Pray to God." And I thought - I used to pray, I knew how
###1725 to pray once!
###1727 No matter where we are, the second a soul wants God, God comes - just
###1732 like that! It's amazing to me because to me that demonstrates mercy... that's what love
###1740 and mercy is, and that's the corrective, merciful love of God. Because every single
###1745 one of these people - and many of these people have written to me who've had these experiences
###1750 to hell and have called out for help - have been so blown away by that merciful nature
###1756 of God their entire life changes.
###1758 There is in the universe a caring, a love, a compassion,
###1763 some kind of meaning to the universe, and I called out to that and I said, "Jesus please
###1768 save me." And with that, He - Jesus - the being of light, the ambassador of God, came
###1774 over me and loved me and took me out of that place. And that changed everything and my
###1781 whole life, my entire life for the past 25 years has all been about that moment and
###1787 trying to get people to say, "God I need you. Jesus I need you. Allah help me." However
###1797 they can express it.
###1799 If we put our reliance back towards where it should be, which is
###1803 on God, and we don't make ourselves our own gods, we humble ourselves and let God lovingly
###1811 correct us and bring us through that path of purification. He will! He will not leave
###1818 you behind. The only time people are left where they are is because the really, truly,
###1825 honestly want to be there - and that's one of the hardest things for people to understand
###1830 is that you stay there because you don't want to do anything different, you like it the
###1835 way things are. You're compatible to it!
###1845 The dogma of materialism I think arose from
###1848 the dogma of the inquisition, of the Christian Church, and burning Giordano Bruno and muzzling
###1856 Galileo Galilei and many other lesser people... burning and muzzling. And so to escape from
###1862 that after the Renaissance and Reformation and Enlightenment, the thinkers and intelligentsia
###1869 in Europe went to another extreme to get away from being dominated by the church and being
###1874 threatened with hell and so forth, and so they abandoned having a soul. They decided
###1879 we don't even have one. We're just a species, we have genes, we have drives,
###1886 survival of the fittest, and went on through all of those different theories. And then
###1892 they got to where they, like Carl Sagan, one of his last books was When Demons Stalked
###1898 the Earth, and it had to do with the Fundamentalists that he'd had to tangle with in Arkansas
###1902 and other places as a scientist. And the idea was that if anything non-physical were admitted
###1908 to exist in the world, this would open the door for all kinds of crazies and new inquisitions
###1915 and demented creationists... like the world is 7,000 years old and the Grand Canyon was
###1921 made in a flash flood and Adam was a white guy... just a silly bunch of stuff. And then
###1927 they'd end up getting political power, these religions, and they'd start clamping down
###1932 on free thought and scientific discovery like they did before.
###1935 Did the Garden of Eden really happen?
###1937 Was the world made, the universe made in literally seven days... or six days and
###1943 a day of rest? I mean, is that how it really happened? That God spoke the universe into
###1948 being? And sometimes in discourse religious people can't get passed that - that it's real
###1955 facts - into a discourse about an even deeper truth underneath which is a description of
###1962 the estrangement in the human community and between human beings and God.
###1967 We let the details trip us up.
###1970 So the dogma of materialism in a spiritual sense boils down to that view
###1974 of not understanding the common sense reality and scientific viability of former and future
###1981 lives - in some form - and that's the heart wrong view of our psychotic culture, which
###1990 thinks it's not connected to the world, it can keep messing with the climate, it can
###1995 kill off all the animals, cut all the trees, do whatever it is. The rapture people do it
###2001 as a sort of warped spiritual thing, but the materialists do it because, 'I'm not
###2005 going to be here, so I'm going to use it up.' And then they will say, 'Oh, no,
###2009 but I'm not unethical, I'm a humanist and I care about my children so I'm
###2013 not going to wreck the planet." But actually they are wrecking the planet.
###2016 If we waste the time here, if we don't take the time to purify ourselves or to move upwards then
###2024 we're going to start circling. And what I mean by circling is when you see people
###2032 for those who believe in reincarnation... and I've had a lot of experiences myself - I didn't
###2036 believe in the reincarnation until I started having mystical experiences about them and
###2040 I've had thousands of them now... but for those who believe in reincarnation you end up coming
###2046 back and doing the same thing over and over again, with the same characters, the same
###2051 configuration. And until you see, "I'm doing something wrong here... there's a reason why
###2057 I keep doing the same thing." And it's made more difficult because most people don't remember
###2061 their previous lives. But sometimes when people become more spiritually alert you'd be surprised
###2068 how quickly they start remembering.
###2070 There's a very strong sense in the most ancient parts
###2073 of Hinduism that we are, in fact, on a journey that takes many lifetimes. To be a being in
###2081 this world is not done in a short period of time, even if that short period of time is
###2086 100 years, but that the purification of nature, the discovery of true identity comes in small
###2093 packets, which we would call one lifetime or another lifetime. And in Hinduism, as in
###2100 Jainism and Buddhism, there is a sense that one can be reborn again and again into new
###2105 bodies as one journeys along one's path. There is no guarantee, of course, that every
###2110 body and every rebirth is better than the one before because we're really faced with
###2115 the prospect of what do you do with the body you have, what do you do with the opportunities
###2119 of your current life? And then, in a sense, that if we use those well, we move into
###2125 more pure, more focused bodies that are directed to the divine. And if we become distracted,
###2132 if we begin to forget who we are, then we might come back in a body that is more immersed
###2138 in matter and less able to be open to the divine. So, there is a way in which every
###2143 life is extremely important because it really charts our way on the course, and yet every
###2148 life also is simply part of a much larger journey that takes a much longer time.
###2152 There's a karmic understanding to everything which is something that's not quite correct, and
###2157 there's an eternal understanding which is the real truth. And so we circle and we keep
###2163 doing the same thing over because we have a karmic understanding, which doesn't create
###2168 peace. It's very chaotic... we're usually messed up. Once we reach that eternal understanding
###2175 there's peace. And that's one of the ways you can tell. Like when someone meets a new
###2181 person, if it's an eternal thing there'll be a lot of peace. If it's karmic, there may
###2188 be a lot of chaos and a lot of really intense emotions and things like that. That may very
###2193 well indicate that there is an issue that's coming up from previous existences that either
###2199 has to do with you and that particular person, or it's just that this particular person is
###2205 going to play that role that has been played for you before in previous existences... and
###2212 that's why it brings up all this intensity. But a lot of times even something that starts
###2219 out karmic, if the two parties are seeking an eternal solution, it can end up well. It
###2228 can become eternal. It can amend to an eternal situation if the two parties both go in that direction.
###2235 I think a lot of individuals can be reincarnated because there was karma carried
###2240 over from a past life. And some of the traditional belief systems in that is that people keep
###2245 reincarnating and reincarnating until they actually get it right.
###2285 So how does one become more spiritually alert?
###2288 You do so by doing what every human being has done for the last
###2292 several thousand years. If you look at the ancient sacred texts throughout history from
###2296 every single world religion it's the same process. It's prayer - prayer is speaking
###2303 to God; Meditation is listening and trying to get that answer; and Spiritual Reading,
###2309 which is utilizing the works of all those people who've come before us who have figured
###2316 it out. And there are many, many people like that from Tibet's Milarepa to Catholicism's
###2323 St. Francis DeSales and St. Catherine of Siena to... Earth Store Bodhisattva was a Buddhist
###2331 monk who had a similar calling that I have where he would actually go into hell realms
###2335 and liberate souls. So you do the spiritual reading to form your conscience better. The
###2342 more of the spiritual reading you do, the more sensitive you become to what is vice
###2348 and what is a virtue.
###2350 If you're not putting good thoughts or good scripture in your mind
###2353 and in your soul, then something else is coming in. So if you're a person who's always
###2358 in front of the television, always watching violent movies or whatever the case may be,
###2363 always involved with that, then your soul is being fed something but it's not being
###2368 fed anything that's going to elevate you or lift you up. In order for your soul to
###2373 be lifted up you have read and study and reflect and meditate on good things.
###2380 The worship, the prayer, the visits to Holy sites, the reading of the books, are not to say the more
###2385 we have the better off we'll be, but all of these are wisdom and advice that lead us
###2392 toward letting go of the things that stand in the way.
###2399 Prayer is saying I want to be
###2402 a part of that life of God in me and to let it more and more fill me, my conscious life,
###2407 so that more and more of how I live, how I speak, how I listen, how I make choices
###2414 is caught up in what God wants to do through me.
###2419 Just think about being in this world,
###2421 where you have to make a living, and it's the hustle and bustle in life... always
###2426 running, always running and you take out five times of the day where you have this
###2432 spiritual refreshment called prayer. You take a break from all that hustle and bustle. It's
###2438 something that empowers you, and it's something that keeps you grounded, because you can
###2443 get lost out there just going after the dollar. And then, it's like nothing else counts, nothing else matters.
###2450 Prayer is a very powerful thing. I recommend it to people continuously
###2456 no matter what your structure is, no matter what your belief system is. There are all
###2462 sets of prayers in different belief systems out there. I recommend very strongly to people
###2467 call upon that. It doesn't hurt to say prayers. It's a very positive element in our lives.
###2474 A lot of times we believe when we're praying that we should be answered in a certain way,
###2481 but in reality, we have to remember that God knows exactly what we need at any given time.
###2488 And God's purpose isn't the same as ours. Our purpose is often very motivated by the
###2494 fact that we're in denial that this is a temporary place of existence. So God is not motivated
###2501 by continuing our denial about the impermanence of this life. He's motivated by what is going
###2507 to give this soul the most progress spiritually at this time. And I have seen many situations
###2515 where miraculous things have occurred and many other situations where the answer is no.
###2523 Nobody can explain that except God because only God knows why He says yes and why He
###2528 says no and why other times He says no, but how about this? But it's because God has that
###2537 all-knowing where He understands what we need to progress.
###2548 We live in a society that's got a lot of noise.
###2552 Listen to yourself and see what yourself is saying. Take time out.
###2556 There are so many people that don't take time out. Some people can't even go to
###2560 sleep unless the music is playing. They can't go to sleep unless the television is on. And
###2565 there's noise everywhere, so shut it down. Once you shut it down you're going to hear
###2568 something inside yourself. You have something talking within you.
###2571 God will use anything and everything
###2573 to reach out to us. God always is. God's always trying to connect with us.
###2577 We forget that. We think, 'Oh, I have to go and find God.' But, in fact, it's more
###2582 like opening our eyes to what's already there. God is reaching out to us all the time.
###2586 It's a lot like tuning your radio. Like when you're in a rural area and you're trying to find
###2590 something to listen to and you're either pressing the digital thing or turning the dial trying
###2597 to find a radio station. Then you get some real terrible country-western thing... you're
###2604 searching, searching, searching for something good to listen to - then finally you found it,
###2608 and you fine tune your radio just so you get it. You got to seek God. And there's
###2615 a lot of voices out there like... chase the ladies, get more money, grow more hair, have
###2624 flat abdominal muscles so you'll be desirable to chicks... whatever. There are all these
###2629 voices out there booming at you all the time, telling you all this like crazy and often
###2634 stupid stuff - and it's bad stuff. And so to tune in God, which is always the voice
###2640 of love and kindness and peace and hope and joy - that's how you recognize it, because
###2650 that's what it sounds like... when you get to that voice and then to be able to focus on it.
###2654 And the thing that's not so hard is it's there, and if you contemplate love,
###2662 contemplate goodness - you can find it.
###2666 I seek to be with God in praying. I seek to
###2668 be with God in hanging around with Him and those who nobody else will have anything to
###2672 do with. I seek to be with God through the sacraments in a wonderful way. I seek to be
###2679 with God through doing what is right, through working for justice. So there are all kinds
###2684 of ways I seek to be with God, but at the base of it all is shutting up and letting Him talk to me.
###2693 We all have guardian angels, we all have forces around us that are trying to lead
###2698 us towards the good, but we've blocked it all out with noise, with sin, with vice, with
###2705 just certain ways of thinking - so they can't reach us. We have to re-open the channel so
###2711 that God can show us what He put us here to do. And if we do that He will show us and
###2718 it becomes really easy because He does show you every step of the way.
###2723 If you get quiet and say,
###2726 "God, what do I need to do?" God will let you know, but it's not necessarily
###2731 in a big Charlton Heston booming voice broadcast. It's more in the Elijah sense... in the small,
###2743 still inner voice. You just contemplate something and then you know that you know that you know.
###2760 When my journey began Jesus came to me and He said it was time for my purification and
###2765 He said, "Gather the ancient sacred texts and all the ancient prayer books because you're
###2771 going to learn from them." And He took me through - I didn't even know what they were.
###2775 He showed me and He told me... He would give me these strange names, like the Holy Teaching
###2780 of Vimalakirti... I was like, "How am I going to find that?" But I went through this process
###2786 and He would tell me what to look for. One was the Dialogues of St. Catherine of Siena,
###2791 which explains Christian mysticism and redemption in such a way that it remains my favorite
###2799 books to this day. I really loved the writings, and was led to read the writings of Imam Ghazali
###2805 who is one of the mystical theologians of Islam. He wrote a really great text called
###2812 the Ihya Ulumuddin - and I actually ordered that from overseas. And it's interesting because
###2820 I compared that with the Catholic contemporary which is Father Adolf Tanqueray's The Spiritual
###2827 Life: A Treatise On Ascetical And Mystical Theology. And it's so interesting when you
###2832 look at the two and you look at many of these things - because there's some Jewish books
###2836 that I'd like to mention as well - that they're just like different sides of the same coin.
###2843 There might be a few different terms used but it's the same idea - they go through the
###2848 purification of the soul through the virtues.
###2857 So what are the seven deadly sins?
###2858 They are gluttony, lust, greed, pride, sloth, vanity, and avarice.
###2863 And the seven virtues which counterbalance the seven deadly sins
###2867 would be prudence, justice, fortitude, temperance, and faith, hope, and love.
###2871 And love is also charity - and faith, hope, and love are in the area that's considered
###2876 supernatural virtues, as well. If you want to talk about how to attain to the virtues
###2881 and to discard some of the vices, you have to really take a close self-examination of
###2888 yourself, and spiritual reading is one of the ways that you do this because that's how
###2892 you make yourself aware of things, because many of the vices we have are so habitual
###2898 that we would never see it in ourselves. We might see in someone else but not in ourselves.
###2903 So in order to attain those virtues you want to engage in the spiritual reading, the prayer,
###2907 and the meditation, but then you also have to practice the virtues that are opposite
###2912 to the vices that you know you have.
###2929 Let's say, for instance, you have an issue with lust.
###2931 You're going to need some temperance. If you have a problem with greed, you're going
###2937 to need to experience the virtue of justice in order to be more willing to part with your goods.
###2944 If you have a vice of greed, then you have to become mindful of that and you have to give.
###2956 Greedy people don't like to give. So if you turn it around and you start giving,
###2961 you can loosen that up a bit, and the hope will be that at some point you're no longer
###2966 that greedy type person because you're giving. If it's gluttony, again, you have
###2970 to back off from the table.
###2972 For those of us who, when we start realizing that we have
###2975 some failings - because I've had a lot - and I have been shown all of them and I'm sure
###2981 there's more to come. When you see them there's a tendency to feel ashamed of yourself. I'll
###2989 never forget the moment when I got to see my vanity through the eyes of God. It was
###2995 so profoundly humbling in the sense of I saw vanity in all its ugliness. Everything I had
###3002 ever done up to that point in my life, including the things that were good, were all done
###3008 for the wrong reason, because they all had some kind of self-serving reason behind it.
###3015 Whether it's to make you do something good for someone else to make yourself to feel
###3018 better, or you do something that's good but you're doing it because it'll make you look
###3024 good... you do, whatever it is, some kind of self-serving reason. That was really a big
###3031 turning point for me - it took me about a month to recover from it. And I have been
###3036 told many times by my angels in the spirit, "This is a time we want you to apply Buddhist
###3041 principles because otherwise we're going to waste too much time with you in shame, where
###3046 we want you to understand this as a fetter, this is something holding you back." Christianity
###3054 has it right - it's very correct - it's just that Buddhism takes it more from an intellectual
###3059 standpoint, and that makes it a little quicker because rather than spending a lot of time
###3067 thinking about how ashamed we are of what we've done, we say, well, this is a fetter,
###3071 this is a hindrance, this is keeping me from moving up towards the love that is God
###3077 so I'm going to let these things fall away.
###3081 When the Bhagavad Gita, like other Hindu texts,
###3083 talks about this yogic practice of simplifying our lives, focusing, getting our bodies in
###3090 order, our morality in order, our spiritual practice in order, it can at first sound very
###3096 complicated, it can sound as if there's so many things to do. But, generally speaking,
###3101 it really is an effort to stop doing things, stop worrying about things, stop needing things...
###3108 physically, mentally, psychologically coming into a simpler and simpler state where one
###3115 is confronting and being confronted by ultimate reality. And because traditions like that
###3121 of Hinduism and the Bhagavad Gita believe that one finds one's joy in the presence
###3127 of the divine, ultimately being happy, rejoicing in life, finding peace, come down to uncluttering
###3135 one's life, doing away with the things that stand in our way and our obstacles and
###3140 coming to that simple presence of ourselves and the divine. Once one gets there, this
###3145 is what we are made for, this is who we are. And in that moment, we find the joy of our
###3151 life, we find the bliss - and there's no reason ever to leave that condition.
###3192 The most difficult part of my experience was not the hellish part that I experienced to get
###3198 to the good part - that was insignificant compared to what Jesus told me about God's
###3206 disappointment with this world because it's a whole lot bigger than me. The human race
###3213 has failed miserably in what God's hope and expectation was what we can be. Granted, God
###3220 put us in a very challenging world - this world is not easy - but the world that God
###3227 wants, and that God will get in the future... it's going to happen because it's what God
###3232 wants, and God gets what God wants - one way or another. That world is going to come about
###3240 and it's so different than the world we have. God doesn't like the idea of propelling bits
###3246 of metal through exploding gases into each other's guts to prove that you're right and
###3252 they're wrong. God doesn't like the idea that a small portion of the planet has so much
###3258 resources and meanwhile there are people in the world who literally don't have enough
###3263 to eat, don't have enough clothes to wear, don't have enough shelter to keep themselves
###3267 dry when it rains. They don't have the minimal resources for survival. And when they show
###3273 those miserable pictures of them on T.V. - it's like, "Change the channel, don't bore me
###3279 with the starving children."
###3281 I remember I went to a church to speak many years ago and
###3284 the pastor told me that he has a problem with his congregation because they're rich - and
###3290 because they're rich they don't believe they commit sin. So it's a challenge for
###3298 him to teach them certain things because they think, 'Oh, I don't do that.' But
###3302 no, they can do it just like anybody else.
###3305 We don't realize how dumb it is that we focus
###3308 so much on mortal, impermanent things in this world. We focus on how we look on the outside,
###3315 whether or not we have enough degrees, whether or not we make enough money... and you know
###3321 the only thing that matters when you're on that deathbed is the people you love and whether
###3327 or not you loved well, whether or not you actually improved and progressed in your spiritual
###3335 life, if you moved closer to God rather than further away.
###3339 People who want more and more
###3340 things are trying to make up for an inner feeling of inadequacy and unfulfillment by
###3346 piling on outer things, but it never works, right? And then as they do that, they get
###3352 angry with others because they think that they want to take things from other people
###3355 so they imagine that other people want to take things from them.
###3358 Living from your center, knowing who
###3360 you are, having a sense that you are living what God created you to live is a pearl of
###3366 great price. And it can't be bought and no one or nothing can take it away from you.
###3373 Careers come and go. Money can come and go. There's nothing wrong with money. Money can
###3378 do great things, but it's a poor master. It's a great tool, terrible master. We need
###3384 more to ground our sense of worth than money. When people live too far from their center
###3389 you can tell, because they're always looking to be entertained and distracted from the
###3393 emptiness they find inside.
###3397 The Buddhist legend of coming to the guide and saying, "I'm suffering...
###3401 I can't deal with it." "Okay, well, I want to help you. This is what you do: Go find
###3405 a home that has known no suffering." So the person goes off to the home and says, "I'm
###3409 looking for a home where there's no suffering." "Oh, no, that's not here." Tells him all the
###3413 suffering, and the person starts working with them... then goes to the next home, same thing,
###3416 works with them. Before they know it, they forget about their own suffering.
###3418 As the Dalai Lama says, if you want to be happier yourself then make other people happy, and forget
###3424 about being happy yourself. Because as long as you're worried about being happy yourself, you'll
###3429 be unhappy because you'll measure how happy you are and then you'll not think
###3433 it's happy enough. You'll want another ice cream cone, you'll want another extra
###3437 thing. But if you forget about how happy you are and you're just trying to make another
###3441 person happy, then without even trying you'll be happy. So as the Dalai Lama says, if you're
###3446 going to be selfish seeking your own happiness,
###3450 at least be a wise selfish and affect other being's happiness.
###3454 Good deeds done well encourage more good deeds done well. A lot of these
###3461 kinds of things we don't realize the astronomical effect it has when we try to bring God into
###3470 what we are doing and we try to keep in mind the well-being of everyone involved and everyone
###3477 around us that others mimic that and they start doing the same. And so it multiplies, and
###3484 you bring more and more light into this world.
###3487 Every time there's an act of goodness, of
###3491 bringing God's light in the world, you're bringing healing. There's a wonderful traditional
###3495 phrase in Jewish mysticism, it's very much used in normative Jewish practice today, it's
###3500 Tikkun Olam. Literally, it means to repair the world. The acts that we can do on a daily
###3506 basis that help bring healing to the world. You're not commanded by God to fix everything...
###3512 but you are commanded by God to keep trying.
###3519 When Jesus told me that my fate was to come
###3522 back in this world and that I was not going to go to heaven - which is what I wanted to do,
###3526 I argued as forcibly as I could to not send me back here. I told Him that the world was
###3533 full of evil, it was a terrible place. And He said, "Yeah, there's a lot of evil in the
###3538 world and there's a lot of bad stuff in the world, but there's a lot of good and a lot
###3541 of loving people." He said, "What you are in your heart is what you're going
###3547 to seek. If you seek hate, you'll find hate, and you are hate. If you seek love,
###3553 you'll find love and you'll be love. If you seek kindness, you'll find kindness, and you'll
###3559 be kindness." And so we have to be it, and seek it, and then we will find it. So I said,
###3566 "But what's the point of sending me back? Why would you want me to go back to that world?
###3575 If you really loved me you wouldn't send me back to that place." And He said, "I need
###3578 you. I need you back there." I said, "You need me to do what?" And He said, "I need
###3582 you to change the world." I said, "Whoa, whoa, whoa... I'm not going to change the world!"
###3587 I said,"I don't even know if I could change me. I don't know if I can be what you want
###3595 me to be, be the loving, kind person you want me to be and asking me to be the Savior
###3603 of the world." He didn't say that, I said it... I was sort of exaggerating my role. He
###3610 said, "No, that's really what I want you to do. I want you to change the world." "That's
###3616 crazy," I said, "people that try and change the world come out to a bad end. We're talking
###3623 about Stalin and Hitler and Genghis Khan... they all wanted to change the world and they were
###3629 all megalomaniacs. I don't want to go back and be a megalomaniac." He said, "No, no,
###3634 no... you got it all wrong. They were bad, they were megalomaniacs. That's not how I
###3642 want you to change the world." And I said, "Well, how do want me to change the world?"
###3644 He said, "Love somebody." And I said, "Okay... but what's the rest of the plan?" He said,
###3652 "No, that's the whole plan." And I said, "If I go back and love someone... that changes
###3657 the world?" And He said, "That's the plan. That's it." I said, "What's the rest of the
###3661 plan?" He said, "That's the whole plan, there is no more. Just love somebody." And I said,
###3665 "If I love somebody, how in the world will that change anything?" And He said, "If you
###3669 love someone, really truly love them, they will love someone, and that person will love
###3675 someone, and that person will love someone." And me, being a clever fellow I was, I said,
###3679 "Yeah, and then they get run over by a truck and that's the end of the plan." And He said,
###3685 "No... because I never said you're the only one." He said, "There's a lot." And I said,
###3692 "Well, how many." He said, "Millions. Millions of people are the instrument of change." And
###3699 I said, "Okay, but there are a lot of trucks down there and a lot of bad stuff can happen
###3704 to thwart the millions of people trying to love somebody." And He said, "Yeah, but I
###3709 have a backup." I said, "What's the backup?" And He said, "Angels." And I said, "So you're
###3715 going to bring the angels into this?" And He said, "The angels are already in it, they're
###3718 already intervening." He said, "So I got millions of people, I got angels beyond counting all
###3726 trying to inspire people, encourage people, help people." He said, "This is God's Will.
###3731 It is inevitable. It's going to happen one way or another. It has to happen because
###3737 it's what God wants." And I said, "Well, when you put it that way... when you put it as like
###3744 God's going to make it happen... sure, I'd be happy to be part of it!" So anyways, this
###3748 is my interpretation: You're either part of the program or you're against it. There's
###3757 no longer an opportunity to sit on the fence and say, oh, look at the foolish loving
###3763 people doing the loving thing. Good luck to them and the Boston Red Sox. And look at
###3768 the bad people going around fermenting hate and fear and strife in the world. Good
###3775 luck to them. You can't do that anymore. You're either in the program, which is God's program
###3782 of turning this world into a loving and kind place or you're against the program. And
###3792 there's nothing in between.
###3797 We are told that you can't even go to sleep if your neighbor's
###3800 hungry and you have food. The Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, told us that our neighbors
###3806 are forty houses in front of us, forty houses in back of us, and forty houses on the side
###3810 of us. And he told us that he received so many instructions from Almighty about the
###3817 neighbor that he thought that the neighbor was going to actually be in the will. That
###3821 you have to actually put the neighbor in the will. So he told us to treat our neighbor
###3824 as we treat ourselves.
###3826 How do I love God in this life? I don't do it by putting on all
###3830 kinds of fancy clothes with jewels and standing and waving my hand and saying, "I love God."
###3835 I don't do it by standing in a pulpit and saying, "I love God." I don't do it by wearing
###3839 a button that says, "I love God and He loves me." I do it by going to the soup kitchen
###3844 down the street. I do it by buying a coat for the guy I know is cold. I do it by taking
###3851 care of those who are the most broken in life and loving them. How do you get to heaven?
###3859 By loving God... and by loving Him in my neighbor.
###3862 We can't journey back to God without taking
###3865 into account our obligation to our neighbor. It's not just about me and God. It's about
###3869 me and the whole human community and how together this earth can be more like the kingdom of
###3876 God, which is a community of justice, of love, of peace. No one's God says, 'Hate your neighbor.'
###3894 Some fanatics in every religion distort, perhaps, but rightly understood
###3899 the core of all religions is a journey of love. A journey toward our fellow human beings
###3904 and toward God not away from them.
###3906 A lot of the times God is saying, "Just be. Just be
###3910 there with that person. You don't you have to fix them. They're not broken. If they
###3916 got brokenness I'll fix them, you just love them the way they are... just love them the
###3920 way they are." I've been with drug users, prostitutes, alcoholics, murderers... I did
###3927 a ministry with a guy on death row for a long time... and God was saying, "You don't have
###3931 to preach to these people, just love them. I'll take care of the rest."
###3937 Love your neighbor as yourself, everything else is commentary.
###3940 If you're really serious about that, you're starting in a position of love.
###3944 If everyone just started with that, that one thing, imagine
###3948 how different the world would be. "I love you. Now let's talk."
###3956 In the Hindu religious traditions
###3959 there is a very universal sense that we are all on the path, and that all
###3963 beings are destined toward a higher development, toward true knowledge, toward ultimately bliss,
###3970 in union with the ultimate reality, or as that reality, or with God. And I think the
###3975 good Hindu teacher can see a crowd before her or him and realize that each person here
###3981 is on the spiritual path, has the same destiny, and yet needs to be allowed to travel at his
###3988 or her own pace. And trying to make somebody travel at somebody else's pace and speed
###3993 things up or slow things down only leads to unhappiness for everyone. So everyone is on
###3998 the journey and yet people are at different stages, just as we tend to be at different
###4002 stages of life depending on our age or circumstances.
###4005 The goal for all of us is that we're trying
###4008 to get to God, and the only way we can do that is by becoming more and more holy. Does
###4014 that mean that any of us are going to achieve perfection in this life? Mm-mmm (no). But
###4019 we can become more aware and even just having the humility to realize who we really are
###4026 in relation to God is a really good place to start.
###4029 I feel that as we are trying to
###4031 move forward and I think that the church is trying to recognize the fact that they need
###4037 to open up and change some of their old methods. I feel that a lot of them were looking at
###4044 it from the perspective that devils and demons and these things were something from the stone
###4050 ages and it really didn't encompass our world.
###4054 The book of Revelation is a very unique piece
###4056 of literature because it's a kind of a literature... apocalyptic literature, that was very popular
###4063 in those years immediately after the death and resurrection of Christ in the early days
###4068 of the church, and it was not necessarily meant as a prediction of the way things are
###4075 going to happen in a physical, historical way. So to say that, in effect, we each participate
###4084 in our own kind of cosmic battle, our own internal battle between light and darkness,
###4090 well, that's the theme of everything I've saying along the way, it's true. And so one
###4095 can see this kind of cosmic battle as simply being a description of what's going on inside
###4101 of each of us.
###4102 I think the very idea of the end of the world is one of those concepts
###4109 that we have in mind without ever really knowing what to make of it in terms of history. We
###4115 do have a sense that everything ends... summer ends, winter ends, the day ends. We know through
###4124 the experience of death that so many people we love, their lives come to an end. And I
###4128 think we can expand that and say the world, too, will come to an end. It may be that the
###4133 Armageddon or the last judgment matters most in terms of my life, my facing up to my destiny,
###4141 my facing up to the fact that some day this life will be over and there are basic choices
###4146 to be made about to live in the face of that reality.
###4148 Judgment is a little different than
###4151 people think because people think of judgment as like an external group or individual saying,
###4156 "You're good, you're bad." That's not the way it works. Our judgment is what our hearts are.
###4161 When I had my life review... I could summarize my life review simply by saying I was judged
###4170 entirely by the quality of my relationships, of whether my relationships were loving
###4177 and caring and compassionate and kind, or whether my relationships with other people
###4184 were me being manipulative, and greedy, and self-centered. And, unfortunately, I was the
###4191 latter and not the former.
###4194 One of the biggest issues that I see in the world today is too
###4198 many people not realizing that there is a function and a purpose for us being here, and
###4204 that function was told to me in a near-death experience I had with Jesus Christ, and it's
###4209 very simple: We're supposed to go from selfishness to selflessness.
