###7 PRESIDENT OBAMA: By 2025, we expect new spacecraft designed
###11 for long journeys to allow us to begin the first ever crewed
###14 missions beyond the Moon into deep space.
###18 We'll start by sending astronauts to an asteroid for
###21 the first time in history.
###24 
###35 NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: There's an asteroid called Apophis
###37 discovered a couple of years ago.
###39 That asteroid, on Friday the 13th in April in the year
###43 2029, will come close enough to Earth to dip below our
###48 orbiting communications satellites.
###49 It'll be the biggest, closest thing
###51 ever in recorded history.
###53 If it goes through what we call the keyhole, which is
###56 where the Earth's gravity is just right, it will hit the
###60 Earth seven years later.
###61 
###64 If it goes through the center of the keyhole, it will hit
###66 the Pacific Ocean and create waves of tsunamis that'll
###69 blast clean the entire west coast of North America.
###72 
###75 MIKE GERNHARDT: It is a statistical certainty that one
###77 day, the Earth will get hit by a large asteroid, whether that
###81 be in 50 years or 100 million years.
###86 
###89 NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: We pay for insurance against car
###91 accidents, against damage to your home, but no one has
###94 organized what it would take to get asteroid insurance.
###98 In fact, the asteroid insurance isn't to replace
###99 your home if you get hit by an asteroid, it would be to have
###102 enough money to do something about it in the first place.
###106 
###113 SAUL ROSSER: My name's Saul Rosser.
###114 I'm the Operations Director at Aquarius Reef Base, which is
###117 NOAA's underwater habitat or research station about four
###120 miles off of Key Largo.
###122 We house six people at a time about 60 feet underwater.
###125 During this mission, we have three astronauts, a planetary
###128 scientist, and two of our technicians living underwater
###131 to work on techniques for exploring asteroids.
###134 
###141 The first habitat was built in 1962 by Jacques Cousteau.
###145 Now 50 years later, this is the last
###147 habitat on the sea floor.
###149 And this is the only place you can do this kind of thing.
###151 So they're down there looking at, how do you translate
###153 across an asteroid, and how do you work out the details of
###155 moving along in a zero-G environment, taking samples,
###159 and working across the surface of the asteroid?
###160 
###163 BILL TODD: NEEMO is NASA's undersea research program--
###166 stands for NASA's Extreme Environment Mission
###168 Operations.
###169 This particular mission is focused on going to an
###172 asteroid and living and working on the surface of an
###175 asteroid, which is a fairly complex and difficult task.
###179 What possibly could be more cool and more exciting than
###184 blending outer space and undersea together in this is
###188 extremely vivid, dynamic, exciting environment that
###193 there's also risk that you have to manage, and you have
###195 to really pay attention to what you're doing?
###197 For me, that's exciting.
###198 
###203 MIKE GERNHARDT: So my name is Mike Gernhardt.
###204 I'm a NASA astronaut.
###205 I've actually flown in space four times, and I'm the
###208 principal investigator of the Neemo 16 mission.
###210 So to be perfectly honest with you, I had my heart set on
###213 going back to the Moon, and I was hoping to maybe have a
###216 chance to be the crew that did that.
###217 So when I first heard we're going to an asteroid and
###221 stopping the lunar program, that was a big
###224 disappointment to me.
###226 But rather than go off and cry in the corner, I picked it up
###230 with my team, and we started working the details of what
###233 it's going to be like to work on an asteroid.
###235 And it's turned out to be a very fascinating, challenging
###238 place to work that's really moved our technologies forward
###240 in a very positive way.
###243 
###247 Working and doing space walks on the asteroid is like the
###250 worst combination of the dirt and all of that of the Moon
###254 but with no ground reaction force.
###257 On the Moon, you can walk.
###259 You have ground reaction force.
###260 On a space station, we're floating around but we have
###263 pre-engineered translation paths with handholds and foot
###266 restraints and all these kinds of things.
###268 And we have none of that on an asteroid.
###270 So two and a half years ago, no one had any idea of how
###273 we're going to do these things.
###275 And we have very systematically developed the
###277 techniques and evaluated them, and I think that we're well on
###281 our way to understanding what those
###282 operations should be like.
###286 
###289 So we probably won't land on an asteroid, but we will touch
###292 the asteroid with a human hand.
###293 And the way we will do that is to be on a foot restraint
###297 that's attached to the space exploration vehicle, this
###300 small vehicle that flies around.
###302 So we'll fly in close to the asteroid and then reach in
###305 with our foot on a foot restraint and grab rocks or
###309 deploy scientific instruments on the asteroid.
###312 So unlike the lunar landing, we will probably not land and
###316 attach to the asteroid.
###317 We will fly around it and touch it with our hands to get
###321 the samples that we need to understand the geology.
###325 
###330 There are all sorts of minerals on these asteroids
###333 that we can't get here on Earth.
###334 There's rare earth metals.
###335 There's platinum.
###336 There's precious metals, things like that.
###340 Without a doubt, there are economic benefits of mining,
###344 and I think it will come.
###346 It's not 10 years away.
###348 I think it's way more than that, but
###351 you gotta start somewhere.
###353 
###357 By going to an asteroid and understanding their
###359 characteristics, that informs us with better techniques for
###364 so-called planetary defense, where we could either slightly
###367 shift the course of the asteroid at a distance far
###370 enough away that it doesn't hit the earth or possibly
###373 percuss it into smaller pieces.
###375 We don't really know the right answer for that, but the more
###378 we know about asteroids, the better informed we'll be to
###382 defend the Earth against an asteroid hit in the future.
###385 NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Well, we're smart enough, and we
###386 have a space program, and we're clever enough that we
###389 never have to go extinct by an asteroid.
###392 We have more choices available to us than
###394 Tyrannosaurus Rex did.
