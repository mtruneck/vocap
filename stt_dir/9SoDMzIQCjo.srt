0:0:5,18 --> 0:0:11,41
We're talking about anthropology tonight. From the point of view of a scientific approach to the problem.


2
0:0:11,41 --> 0:0:19,6
And so heres how anthropology might be viewed as a scientist might look at it.. some scientists.


3
0:0:19,6 --> 0:0:22,53
We would look at a culture.. Does anyone have any ideas?


4
0:0:22,53 --> 0:0:27,59
Of what might be done. What you think, the methods might be. Want to guess that?


5
0:0:27,59 --> 0:0:28,65
Yes try it.


6
0:0:28,65 --> 0:0:31,48
Man: A possible comparison to some other known system.


7
0:0:31,48 --> 0:0:33,98
Yes.. thats the way you do it.


8
0:0:33,98 --> 0:0:39,5
What you do is you take an area, we'll take a rough idea of an island.


9
0:0:39,5 --> 0:0:41,8
And we'll put a tribe here.


10
0:0:41,8 --> 0:0:45,8
Now we'll say "well they eat fish and use this area of water for fishing"


11
0:0:45,8 --> 0:0:51,49
They... they pick their crops in this area of the forest.


12
0:0:51,49 --> 0:0:55,16
Then they get their root plants in this area of the forest.


13
0:0:55,16 --> 0:0:59,98
And they make their boats, they get their building material from this area of the forest.


14
0:0:59,98 --> 0:1:2,22
Then they get their water from this area.


15
0:1:2,22 --> 0:1:5,86
And so.. This is the area of resource supply.


16
0:1:5,86 --> 0:1:10,45
Then you deal with the population, how many people exist you know.


17
0:1:10,45 --> 0:1:15,83
Then you draw functional connections between the tribe and its real physical need.


18
0:1:15,83 --> 0:1:19,96
Water.. food.. fish.


19
0:1:19,96 --> 0:1:21,62
You draw all of those things


20
0:1:21,62 --> 0:1:27,17
Then you measure the amount of work done to accumulate a pile of food so high.


21
0:1:27,17 --> 0:1:28,77
Anyone doesn't understand that?


22
0:1:28,77 --> 0:1:34,7
You got 100 people and you put out so many man hours to gather the fruit and the bananas.


23
0:1:34,7 --> 0:1:37,15
You measure the efficiency ratio of the tribe.


24
0:1:37,15 --> 0:1:40,9
That is.. how much work they had to do to get a potato.


25
0:1:40,9 --> 0:1:44,6
If you had to walk over the hill and plant the seeds, and take all day to bring it back.


26
0:1:44,6 --> 0:1:48,29
Thats a hell of a whole lot, you use up a potato and a half of energy to get a potato.


27
0:1:48,29 --> 0:1:53,54
So.. we measure the efficiency of how much energy they put out to get the job done.


28
0:1:53,54 --> 0:1:55,44
But if you're dying of thirst.


29
0:1:55,44 --> 0:2:0,87
And you looked up and theres a canteen of water on top of a mountain or desert.


30
0:2:0,87 --> 0:2:4,9
To get up there you use two canteens of water within your body..


31
0:2:4,9 --> 0:2:7,1
..to get that canteen of water, so you don't go up there in the first place.


32
0:2:7,1 --> 0:2:10,57
So what happens is that you measure these activities.


33
0:2:10,57 --> 0:2:12,67
The next thing you measure..


34
0:2:12,67 --> 0:2:16,8
is activities superfluous to the task at hand.


35
0:2:16,8 --> 0:2:18,52
Now..


36
0:2:18,52 --> 0:2:22,33
We measure activities superfluous to the task at hand.


37
0:2:22,33 --> 0:2:27,7
Now heres what that means. Does anyone want to volunteer what they think that means?


38
0:2:27,7 --> 0:2:30,31
What are activities superfluous in task?


39
0:2:30,31 --> 0:2:33,45
Man: Just general entertainment, amusement by (?)


40
0:2:33,45 --> 0:2:34,48
Yes thats superfluous in..


41
0:2:34,48 --> 0:2:35,7
The task.. the task is to eliminate (?)
Yes thats superfluous in..


42
0:2:35,7 --> 0:2:37,66
The task.. the task is to eliminate (?)


43
0:2:37,66 --> 0:2:40,18
Does anybody else want to say anything to that?


44
0:2:40,18 --> 0:2:41,73
I'll tell you what that means.


45
0:2:41,73 --> 0:2:47,3
That means if you go out to fly a kite one day, you ever fly a kite?


46
0:2:47,3 --> 0:2:51,34
And you get ordered and you get on the bus and go all the way out there and then it rains.


47
0:2:51,34 --> 0:2:53,29
Badly, heavily.


48
0:2:53,29 --> 0:2:58,8
And you say oh darn it, fiddly-dee or shit whatever you say.


49
0:2:58,8 --> 0:3:0,42
That doesn't stop the rain.


50
0:3:0,42 --> 0:3:6,35
And that would be activities more than necessary to fly a kite. You don't need it.


51
0:3:6,35 --> 0:3:11,21
But if you just got a flat tire and you say "god dammit I just had a tire and I bought it." and all that.


52
0:3:11,21 --> 0:3:16,78
 ...get on out of your car and put the other tire on. That would be essential.


53
0:3:16,78 --> 0:3:20,24
And if you can afford it, you pick up the phone and say get down here and change the tire.


54
0:3:20,24 --> 0:3:25,48
You put it on somebody else's back, and you use money to pay them off, that's another way.


55
0:3:25,48 --> 0:3:28,16
Now you measure all of those factors.


56
0:3:28,16 --> 0:3:30,64
Then you take their beliefs.


57
0:3:30,64 --> 0:3:33,85
They believe that the potato was put there by the water god..


58
0:3:33,85 --> 0:3:36,76
..because the water god was angry at the banana god..


59
0:3:36,76 --> 0:3:41,17
the banana god made it rain on Wednesdays. And that made this god mad.


60
0:3:41,17 --> 0:3:46,46
And all of that bullshit is what we call cerebral clutter of the tribe


61
0:3:46,46 --> 0:3:47,91
You think you know what I mean?


62
0:3:47,91 --> 0:3:50,24
They build up a lot of cerebral clutter.


63
0:3:50,24 --> 0:3:53,1
Thats is.. they talk to their bananas.


64
0:3:53,1 --> 0:3:56,29
And they talk to...


65
0:3:56,29 --> 0:4:2,3
they placate the sea, they go down and they hope that the sea wont be bad next year and generate tidal waves.


66
0:4:2,3 --> 0:4:4,98
And you build up non essential verbal clutter.


67
0:4:4,98 --> 0:4:6,9
Okay?


68
0:4:6,9 --> 0:4:7,41
Now!


69
0:4:7,41 --> 0:4:10,78
Then you add up the efficiency of one island against the other.


70
0:4:10,78 --> 0:4:14,3
because when you go to another planet, and I say "What kind of society do they have?"


71
0:4:14,3 --> 0:4:17,45
What is the efficiency ratio of the society?


72
0:4:17,45 --> 0:4:19,82
If they have this much arable land area


73
0:4:19,82 --> 0:4:26,1
And they maintain a population that can eat off that. They are alright.


74
0:4:26,1 --> 0:4:28,46
If they let that population too many people grow, there wont be enough bananas to go around.


75
0:4:28,46 --> 0:4:33,1
They have to maintain some sort of eco-balance. Alright.


76
0:4:33,1 --> 0:4:35,9
Now the folk ways...You know what that means?


77
0:4:35,9 --> 0:4:42,78
Who marries who and what ceremonies you do when a guy dies, bury the arrow heads and his fur.


78
0:4:42,78 --> 0:4:45,32
And you bury his favorite hat with him.


79
0:4:45,32 --> 0:4:51,79
That would be depriving a tribe of some possibly useful equipment.


80
0:4:51,79 --> 0:4:57,51
We talk about that in terms of energy expenses toward a non-functional gain.


81
0:4:57,51 --> 0:5:1,4
Now, are there any problems with that kind of thinking in relation to anthropology?


82
0:5:1,4 --> 0:5:4,5
I didn't go into at all which I'm going to any more.


83
0:5:4,5 --> 0:5:8,73
I would like to know whether you would like to raise questions about that now.


84
0:5:8,73 --> 0:5:11,88
Man:Is there any importance in it, whats the importance of anthropology?


85
0:5:11,88 --> 0:5:12,62
Whats is the what?


86
0:5:12,62 --> 0:5:16,9
Man: I there any importance to anthropology?


87
0:5:16,9 --> 0:5:17,94
Is there any importance?


88
0:5:17,94 --> 0:5:18,75
Man: whats the point of doing this?


89
0:5:18,75 --> 0:5:22,54
Well the point is, it deals with the evolution of culture.


90
0:5:22,54 --> 0:5:27,21
So in the study of man and his technological climb.


91
0:5:27,21 --> 0:5:32,49
Okay? you draw the technological climb and then you draw this line.


92
0:5:32,49 --> 0:5:38,43
This non-technological climb; religion, superstition, hanging plastic Jesus in your car.


93
0:5:38,43 --> 0:5:41,2
You draw all the non technological..


94
0:5:41,2 --> 0:5:46,5
The technological thing. The non technological are downward trends. You see that?


95
0:5:46,5 --> 0:5:50,6
In other words. If you have a machine that doesn't work too well and you yell..


96
0:5:50,6 --> 0:5:54,21
 ..its better to pick up a can of oil and oil it. Because that means standing there and yelling.


97
0:5:54,21 --> 0:5:56,86
So that would be technological.


98
0:5:56,86 --> 0:6:1,82
Technological is where you break a leg, then you make a crutch out of wood.


99
0:6:1,82 --> 0:6:3,99
That would be a technological solution.


100
0:6:3,99 --> 0:6:9,28
But sitting under bay leaves for three months under the sun..


101
0:6:9,28 --> 0:6:15,33
Doesn't really help cure your broken leg. That would be patterns unrelated. Is that alright?


102
0:6:15,33 --> 0:6:23,44
Now if I send you in a submarine on an expedition and some of the cable..


103
0:6:23,44 --> 0:6:29,39
Those gadgets they lowering in to the water the spheres , they lower them into the ocean depths?


104
0:6:29,39 --> 0:6:35,44
A mile down.. and all that cuts the cable. It falls deep into a trench.


105
0:6:35,44 --> 0:6:39,49
And you say "Oh geeze I hope I can get out of here."


106
0:6:39,49 --> 0:6:43,15
Because they don't.. A ship.. that lowers you into the sea..


107
0:6:43,15 --> 0:6:49,46
doesn't have 67 other bathyspheres and rescue equipment also included in the expedition.


108
0:6:49,46 --> 0:6:54,41
They also don't have a bathysphere joined by an airlock.


109
0:6:54,41 --> 0:6:59,11
And another bathysphere joined to that and another joined to that, separate units.


110
0:6:59,11 --> 0:7:4,3
That would drop together and if anything goes wrong you could climb into other units.


111
0:7:4,3 --> 0:7:9,91
That would be redundancy, safety. Does that make sense to you? Extra gas in the car, whatever.


112
0:7:9,91 --> 0:7:13,94
So instead of lowering some poor bastard to the bottom of the sea.


113
0:7:13,94 --> 0:7:20,6
You do it redundantly with additional safety equipment, ok. We get back to anthropology.


114
0:7:20,6 --> 0:7:28,99
Then you try to find out why they worship the guava instead of all the other fruits.


115
0:7:28,99 --> 0:7:33,95
And they say once he came sick and we were out of food, and we fed them guava and they got well.


116
0:7:33,95 --> 0:7:40,62
You can find out how these customs came to be. How it is that we evolve certain language habits.


117
0:7:40,62 --> 0:7:45,44
And then we you deliver the information through anthropology, you just show charts.


118
0:7:45,44 --> 0:7:52,24
And you show their music.. And you show this, for example I mention this many times in sessions.


119
0:7:52,24 --> 0:7:58,22
So the great plains Indians of the west have dances they do around the fire.


120
0:7:58,22 --> 0:8:0,47
And the dance I indicated is this.


121
0:8:0,47 --> 0:8:2,89
(Fresco Stomps)


122
0:8:2,89 --> 0:8:6,91
Theres a bird, a turkey, kind of a turkey that walks like that. Did you know that?


123
0:8:6,91 --> 0:8:10,2
And that's where they got the dance, so you show all of that.


124
0:8:10,2 --> 0:8:14,57
And you show how all of their customs, you try, this is a very difficult job to do..


125
0:8:14,57 --> 0:8:22,45
Try to link up the connections of their customs and the major influences that primary effected those customs.


126
0:8:22,45 --> 0:8:24,24
You want some paper to draw on of any kind?


127
0:8:24,24 --> 0:8:24,85
Man: No


128
0:8:24,85 --> 0:8:25,66
Alright.


129
0:8:25,66 --> 0:8:29,8
So we show all that, and then that way we build a chain


130
0:8:29,8 --> 0:8:35,26
Linking early systems of society and the technological growth..


131
0:8:35,26 --> 0:8:39,96
And the primitive growth how it, they go through all the technological society.


132
0:8:39,96 --> 0:8:45,98
As we come to say 1914. We have a pretty high degree of technology, even in 1914.


133
0:8:45,98 --> 0:8:52,79
But you show how the superstition and the folkways still come from the primitive tribes and have clung to that society.


134
0:8:52,79 --> 0:8:58,92
And you try to show how it is that 20th century man even then he walks on the moon


135
0:8:58,92 --> 0:9:1,46
may take a plastic jesus with him on the moon.


136
0:9:1,46 --> 0:9:4,1
You show how it is that he does that.


137
0:9:4,1 --> 0:9:7,18
What the factors are that makes him do that.


138
0:9:7,18 --> 0:9:9,21
Does anybody here the things they know?


139
0:9:9,21 --> 0:9:15,36
Why a man in the space age would spit on his telescope and wish him a lot of luck?


140
0:9:15,36 --> 0:9:17,56
People do that occasionally.


141
0:9:17,56 --> 0:9:21,41
Man: Positive thinking, using the most positive attitude.


142
0:9:21,41 --> 0:9:24,34
Does that mean he may not have a positive attitude?


143
0:9:24,34 --> 0:9:25,98
He has a degree of uncertainty.


144
0:9:25,98 --> 0:9:27,4
Man: He's uncertain he my be negative.


145
0:9:27,4 --> 0:9:33,38
Uncertainly sometimes may cause that as the prime effect to carry on habits.


146
0:9:33,38 --> 0:9:36,91
Uh.. even back then, they weren't very useful.


147
0:9:36,91 --> 0:9:41,36
They weren't useful to the tribe, but you cant take them away. Thats something you can't do.


148
0:9:41,36 --> 0:9:44,85
Alright, now this is a description of anthropology.


149
0:9:44,85 --> 0:9:51,24
Now what do you feel that description may lack, at least compressed or other things we talk about?


150
0:9:51,24 --> 0:9:56,52
Man: It doesn't contain any.. its like studying economics or political science. Those things don't contain any solutions.


151
0:9:56,52 --> 0:10:3,81
Oh! We don't consider the early stages of man with a solution in mind.


152
0:10:3,81 --> 0:10:10,55
When we say..When we go to uh.. If I go to New Guinea, I go to some place, I go to a Seminole Indian village.


153
0:10:10,55 --> 0:10:13,47
They don't send me there to modify the village.


154
0:10:13,47 --> 0:10:18,36
The school says "go on and study the customs of the Seminole Indians".


155
0:10:18,36 --> 0:10:22,66
Now, the Seminole Indian. Well one of the arguments I had with this anthropologists,


156
0:10:22,66 --> 0:10:28,52
She said that primitive people were happier than we are in our technological civilization.


157
0:10:28,52 --> 0:10:33,14
Well I asked her whether not she could show me anything that indicates that.


158
0:10:33,14 --> 0:10:37,14
The reason I said that they were not, she said "do you have any evidence to show me that they are not?"


159
0:10:37,14 --> 0:10:42,34
And I said that uh.. If they hand you the pipe of peace, I come as a friend...


160
0:10:42,34 --> 0:10:46,91
Then you say "I don't smoke its bad for the lungs but i agree with you that peace is essential"


161
0:10:46,91 --> 0:10:51,48
They don't sit back and say "well thats your custom, thats interesting as long as you come with the same intention".


162
0:10:51,48 --> 0:10:58,82
They have no shades of gray. If you don't drink their bowl of fly soup when they offer it to you


163
0:10:58,82 --> 0:11:2,26
If you push it away, you've offended the chief.


164
0:11:2,26 --> 0:11:8,4
But I'm sure if people came from another planet and we offered them some meat and they said "we're vegetarians"


165
0:11:8,4 --> 0:11:13,29
"whip up some fresh vegetables"


166
0:11:13,29 --> 0:11:17,96
We would not be offended. So primitive people tend to project a hell of a lot.


167
0:11:17,96 --> 0:11:20,73
Man: What happens Sometimes is you got stress.


168
0:11:20,73 --> 0:11:25,26
Man: I mean, if one wants to use a level of stress in their lives as a measure.


169
0:11:25,26 --> 0:11:31,92
Man: Might, under certain circumstances some primitive people might be better﻿ off and it might depend on the tribe under study.


170
0:11:31,92 --> 0:11:37,51
Yes, it might be. It might be but they are not happier because they are primitive.


171
0:11:37,51 --> 0:11:41,6
They may be happier in your sense because they had uh..


172
0:11:41,6 --> 0:11:44,89
They had an island, they had a low population density and a lot of food.


173
0:11:44,89 --> 0:11:46,79
But not because they are primitive.


174
0:11:46,79 --> 0:11:50,92
Primitive means less able to cope with problems.


175
0:11:50,92 --> 0:11:56,1
Before the outrigger canoe a lot of boats would over turn in the sea, a lot of people drowned.


176
0:11:56,1 --> 0:12:1,42
Now, people tell me that the primitives at least worked out the outrigger canoe. I don't think that the primitives did.


177
0:12:1,42 --> 0:12:6,98
I think some primitive worked on the outrigger canoe and the others were supported by that idea.


178
0:12:6,98 --> 0:12:13,4
Some primitives probably invented the javelin, or modified a stick that they throw.


179
0:12:13,4 --> 0:12:19,4
Some primitives may had added the bow and arrow to the tribe. Which could have had enhanced the survival in the tribe.


180
0:12:19,4 --> 0:12:23,55
But happiness is a method. When a primitives wife doesn't behave


181
0:12:23,55 --> 0:12:28,44
he doesn't walk over there and say "Now look if you don't behave we cant get the job done."


182
0:12:28,44 --> 0:12:30,82
So the primitives work it out real well.


183
0:12:30,82 --> 0:12:35,75
When John gets married and he tells you what to do you do it or he'll hang you up by your hair.


184
0:12:35,75 --> 0:12:37,42
You under stand what I mean. 


185
0:12:37,42 --> 0:12:42,35
So a lot of primitive tribes are not so free and democratic.


186
0:12:42,35 --> 0:12:46,5
They don't sit around to discuss anything. The witchdoctor says this is the way it is.


187
0:12:46,5 --> 0:12:50,97
And you say "I wonder at that." That is discouraged.


188
0:12:50,97 --> 0:12:59,3
If by happiness you mean from awakening to sleep..


189
0:12:59,3 --> 0:13:7,21
The amount of stress that occurs in that person. Pain is one way of measuring it.


190
0:13:7,21 --> 0:13:10,61
Is the chief happy because he has his javelin in his hut?


191
0:13:10,61 --> 0:13:17,33
We say that happiness is a very interesting thing. Your going to deal with that, I'll try to give you a description of it.


192
0:13:17,33 --> 0:13:22,1
If I were to give you a brand new Mercedes. Lets say.. How old are you?


193
0:13:22,1 --> 0:13:24,18
Boy: 14


194
0:13:24,18 --> 0:13:28,46
Alright. And we worked it out so you could drive it, through town and all that, you're able to do that.


195
0:13:28,46 --> 0:13:31,82
I think you'd be very happy.. for a while.


196
0:13:31,82 --> 0:13:35,3
Then after 3 years you get in your Mercedes and drive it around.


197
0:13:35,3 --> 0:13:37,91
I don't think you'd say"Gosh its nice to have a Mercedes."


198
0:13:37,91 --> 0:13:41,22
Its only the beginning when someone gets you a new toy.


199
0:13:41,22 --> 0:13:45,85
The minute you shove that electric train in your closet. You know what I mean?


200
0:13:45,85 --> 0:13:53,74
When you get a bunch of (?). You gotta know how to (?). You shove them on a shelf (?).


201
0:13:53,74 --> 0:13:59,79
Take them off the shelf a second time, unless you have a goal in mind. You know what that means?


202
0:13:59,79 --> 0:14:7,7
Thats means if Paul makes a boat for me, I sail around in Biscayne Bay, and then I've sailed it in Biscayne Bay.


203
0:14:7,7 --> 0:14:15,37
And I may enjoy doing that weekends. But if he ordered me to do it everyday of my life. I may not enjoy it.


204
0:14:15,37 --> 0:14:19,47
But if i have a goal. I wanted to go to the Exuma islands.


205
0:14:19,47 --> 0:14:25,13
Then I'm going somewhere, and that the journey from here to there may..


206
0:14:25,13 --> 0:14:30,1
have elements in it that make me feel good because I'm getting somewhere.


207
0:14:30,1 --> 0:14:36,35
But if a storm comes that interferes with it. That interferes with the kind of happiness.


208
0:14:36,35 --> 0:14:41,58
Like if you go to see the south seas on a trip. And theres a fog going through the area.


209
0:14:41,58 --> 0:14:44,55
And you're traveling on a boat and they guy says thats Tonga island over there.


210
0:14:44,55 --> 0:14:48,36
You cant see. That would be an interference factor.


211
0:14:48,36 --> 0:14:54,5
So whenever I go on a boat and the guy says its foggy. I go downstairs and leave.


212
0:14:54,5 --> 0:14:57,6
I don't shit now I cant see the islands I came to see.


213
0:14:57,6 --> 0:15:6,89
So through a system of a certain type of maturation in attitudes, the way you grow up and think about things.


214
0:15:6,89 --> 0:15:12,32
If you want to go bicycle riding with the kids and you bike is gone. No one can lend you a bike, it was stolen.


215
0:15:12,32 --> 0:15:18,2
You better go to the roof, instead of staying home saying "shit I can't go, they're all out bike riding"


216
0:15:18,2 --> 0:17:18,2
That is the unhealthy thing to do. Finding something else to do, ok.
