###23 GELAREH KIAZAND: So here, we're at the dog fights.

###28 GELAREH KIAZAND: He's saying, it's wrong, it is bad.
###31 Whatever people may think, I love it, and I'm going to do
###33 it until the day I die.
###36 Because that's my addiction.

###51 GELAREH KIAZAND: When you think of gambling, you think
###53 of Las Vegas and tacky slot machines.
###55 And when you think of Afghanistan, you think of its
###57 reputation for corruption, its never-ending
###59 wars, and the Taliban.
###62 But in spite of all this, the men of Kabul have found refuge
###65 in a world of quail fighting parlors and dusty
###67 dog fighting circles.
###69 We're going to explore this culture of illicit gambling
###71 and see how the men of Kabul thrive in a realm of sport
###74 that defies Islam.
###76 We're going to Marshal Fahim's gardens.
###78 This is really exciting.
###79 We just got a phone call saying that there might be a
###82 buzkashi game on today.
###84 So we're on our way there now, and hopefully we can see the
###88 game and maybe talk to his spokesperson.
###92 Buzkashi is the national sport of Afghanistan.
###95 It's a lot like polo, but instead of a ball, they play
###97 with a headless goat carcass.
###99 The sport is legal, but all the side betting that the
###101 crowds take part in is not.
###103 And since Afghanistan's vice president, Marshal Mohammed
###106 Fahim, was hosting the game at his estate, it was a bit
###109 tricky for us to get in.

###122 GELAREH KIAZAND: All right, so we got in, and then we got
###125 sent out again.
###126 Because today, Mr. Fahim decided to
###129 show up to the game.
###130 And with Fahim, they're not going to be allowing just
###133 anyone-- especially a foreigner, a
###135 woman, with a camera.
###138 Kabul is the center of this gambling world.
###140 But since betting is illegal, reputation is very important.
###143 It was unlikely that they were going to allow an Iranian
###145 woman into the bettor's circle,
###147 especially with a camera.
###149 So we had to find some one people trusted, an old-timer--
###151 Dardar.
###153 We're in West Kabul right now.
###154 We're to meet Mr. Samad Dardar.
###157 He's an 80-year-old man who, back in the days, they called
###160 him The Gangster, because of all the fights
###162 he used to get into.
###163 He's a very, very hard man to get a hold of.

###257 GELAREH KIAZAND: Thursday morning--
###258 our first in.
###259 We get a phone call from Dardar.
###261 8:00 AM, there will be a quail fight 20
###262 minutes outside of Kabul.
###264 We're at Saleh Dezama's cafe.
###268 It's away from all the craze of the city.
###271 They're very strict on the people they let in.
###272 They don't just let anyone in.
###274 During the Talib times, obviously this place was
###276 closed down, and no one would come here.
###278 -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###280 
###285 GELAREH KIAZAND: The Taliban banned the sport, largely
###288 because the fights were community-driven and brought a
###290 wide spectrum of influential men together that could form
###293 alliances dangerous to the regime.
###297 So head of the circle is sitting there with the white
###299 bag in front of him.
###300 I'm trying to get people to put more birds out or fight a
###304 bit, because they're a bit reluctant in
###305 front of the camera.
###306 Everyone here pretty much has a bird with them.
###309 They usually fight for a couple hours.
###310 They sell them behind here in case you don't have one.
###314 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###317 GELAREH KIAZAND: So what they're doing right now is,
###319 they go around and they start comparing the different quails
###323 to each other.
###324 So what they have to do is, they have to
###325 get the same weight.
###327 And then, once they pick, then they come out in the middle.
###332 So how does a bird win?
###333 One quail has to push the other out of the ring, or in
###336 this case, close to the edge of the carpet.
###338 When a quail is pushed out of the ring, or simply flees,
###341 it's game over.
###342 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###352 GELAREH KIAZAND: After the first couple rounds, the
###353 betting slowed down.
###354 The Taliban were known for targeting animal fights and
###357 gambling rings when they were in power.
###359 And even now, the bettors were nervous about being caught
###361 gambling on camera.
###363 
###366 The owner noticed, and told us to turn off our cameras.
###369 Yeah, they want us to leave.
