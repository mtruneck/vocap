create a clash of two


4
0:0:24,98 --> 0:0:27,88
margins-- the people from the
city and the people from


5
0:0:27,88 --> 0:0:28,95

6
0:0:28,95 --> 0:0:32,88
I was thinking that showing
these fancy guys from the town


7
0:0:32,88 --> 0:0:37,33
who get lost somewhere and
people in the village who are


8
0:0:37,33 --> 0:0:39,59
also lost can be a nice idea.

JAN KWIECINSKI: One thing was
the margins, and the other


13
0:0:51,33 --> 0:0:54,38
thing was the unknown place,
which the audience had never


14
0:0:54,38 --> 0:0:55,5
seen before.


15
0:0:55,5 --> 0:0:58,59
And I was thinking that maybe
that a cool idea would be if I


16
0:0:58,59 --> 0:1:0,86
would go to place where I
have never been before.

JAN KWIECINSKI: What is great
about Parysewo is that when I


29
0:1:35,7 --> 0:1:38,48
first came here, it
was totally empty.


30
0:1:38,48 --> 0:1:41,37
Basically, there was nobody
on the street.


31
0:1:41,37 --> 0:1:42,69
It was very mysterious.


32
0:1:42,69 --> 0:1:47,22
Because you look at this amazing
big church, but it's


33
0:1:47,22 --> 0:1:48,8
untouched in a way.


34
0:1:48,8 --> 0:1:54,6
There are 100-year-old houses,
and you feel that you don't

0:1:54,6 --> 0:1:55,66
have this life outside.


36
0:1:55,66 --> 0:1:57,8
It feels like it's the
middle of nowhere.


37
0:1:57,8 --> 0:2:1,6
I felt a quite strange
atmosphere here.


38
0:2:1,6 --> 0:2:2,91
I don't know what it is.


39
0:2:2,91 --> 0:2:5,13
Logistically, like from my point
of view, it's quite easy


40
0:2:5,13 --> 0:2:8,11
to close the town and to
shoot the empty town.


41
0:2:8,11 --> 0:2:12,46
And I was thinking that maybe
it wouldn't be such a stupid


42
0:2:12,46 --> 0:2:15,422

there.

49
0:2:33,55 --> 0:2:35,26
logical structure.


50
0:2:35,26 --> 0:2:40,22
I tried to write as few details
as possible because of


51
0:2:40,22 --> 0:2:45,25
the fact that I want my actors
to feel creative and to be a


52
0:2:45,25 --> 0:2:46,67
part of the storytelling.


53
0:2:46,67 --> 0:2:50,4
And in my opinion, it's always
good to open these kind of


54
0:2:50,4 --> 0:2:54,45
doors to the actors because they
straightaway feel like a


55
0:2:54,45 --> 0:2:56,5
participant of the project.


56
0:2:56,5 --> 0:2:58,368

63

I was really lucky because they
knew each other before


64
0:3:29,85 --> 0:3:31,2
they met in my project.


65
0:3:31,2 --> 0:3:34,69
I felt there was an energy which
is coming straight from


66
0:3:34,69 --> 0:3:35,77
nothing in a way.


67
0:3:35,77 --> 0:3:39,77
I felt from the beginning of the
project that these are the


68
0:3:39,77 --> 0:3:44,281
kind of actors which will make
these characters feel alive.

JAN KWIECINSKI: I got a
good group in here.


72
0:3:56,27 --> 0:4:0,25
And sometimes the director who
really wants to direct can


73
0:4:0,25 --> 0:4:1,615
kill the project.


74
0:4:1,615 --> 0:4:4,3
A very, very important
part of the


75
0:4:4,3 --> 0:4:6,18
process is keeping distance.


76
0:4:6,18 --> 0:4:9,71
And what's helps you in keeping
distance is constantly


77
0:4:9,71 --> 0:4:11,46
sharing this idea
with the others.


78
0:4:11,46 --> 0:4:15,1
Don't think that only your way
is the good way because that


79
0:4:15,1 --> 0:4:18,89
can make the project look really
like without life.


80
0:4:18,89 --> 0:4:21,35
And this way of thinking about
the script, I think it's not


81
0:4:21,35 --> 0:4:24,93
only connected with thinking how
should you work with the


82
0:4:24,93 --> 0:4:28,36
actors, but also how should you
work with other people who


83
0:4:28,36 --> 0:4:30,19
are participating in
movie projects.


84
0:4:30,19 --> 0:4:32,82
And I try to not make
it my script but


85
0:4:32,82 --> 0:4:34,32
their script as well.

She's terrified.


89
0:4:40,2 --> 0:4:43,17
She peed on me, like,
twice already.


90
0:4:43,17 --> 0:4:47,58
We want to show that the town
got abandoned by locals, and


91
0:4:47,58 --> 0:4:50,6
these dogs are homeless, and
they just hang around.


92
0:4:50,6 --> 0:4:54,32
We make sure that we have bag of
kielbasa, polish sausages.


93
0:4:54,32 --> 0:4:55,93
And we just bribe them.


94
0:4:55,93 --> 0:4:58,45
If they come with us, they
start their career.

JAN KWIECINSKI: I really feel
so overwhelmed that I'm the


97
0:5:5,23 --> 0:5:7,4
participant of this project.


98
0:5:7,4 --> 0:5:12,8
And I really feel like this so
great opportunity to me.


99
0:5:12,8 --> 0:5:14,32
And it's really hard
to talk about it.


100
0:5:14,32 --> 0:5:15,95
Everything was so fast.


101
0:5:15,95 --> 0:5:19,65
And the whole process is
like I didn't even


102
0:5:19,65 --> 0:5:21,682
notice where it started.


103
0:5:21,682 --> 0:5:24,59
It wasn't clear at all.


104
0:5:24,59 --> 0:5:29,5
You gave us this super
opportunity to talk about


105
0:5:29,5 --> 0:5:33,48
something so metaphysical that
you can't even talk about it.


106
0:5:33,48 --> 0:5:36,29
So this is the four dimension of
my movie, trying to capture


107
0:5:36,29 --> 0:5:40,99
something beyond our perception,
something more


108
0:5:40,99 --> 0:5:41,91
than we can imagine.


109
0:5:41,91 --> 0:5:46,92
So from the beginning, I was
thinking, create the story


110
0:5:46,92 --> 0:5:49,39
between this magical
and real world.


111
0:5:49,39 --> 0:5:52,7
But the magic has to be created
from the realism which


112
0:5:52,7 --> 0:5:54,192
you are making.


113
0:5:54,192 --> 0:5:57,24
And maybe we'll find four
dimensions in the end.


114
0:5:57,24 --> 0:5:59,69
I hope so.
