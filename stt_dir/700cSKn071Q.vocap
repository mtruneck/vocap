###13 CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: Glad you`re starting your new week with CNN STUDENT NEWS. My name
###16 is Carl Azuz. We are going to start today at the top of the U.S. Central Intelligence
###20 Agency. That organization, the CIA, will be getting a new director, because the previous
###27 one resigned. On Friday, Director David Petraeus turned in his resignation and admitted to
###32 cheating on his wife. This all started with an FBI investigation into emails being sent
###38 by the woman who wrote Petraeus` biography. The investigation turned up other emails that
###43 revealed the CIA director`s affair.
###46 Some congressional leaders, both Democrats and Republicans, have raised questions about
###50 why they were not told about the investigation sooner, since it could have had an impact
###54 on national security. The name David Petraeus might be familiar to you. At different times,
###60 he was the commander of U.S. forces in both Iraq and Afghanistan. He became CIA director
###65 in September of last year, after he officially left the military.
###69 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
###71 JONATHAN MANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: I`m Jonathan Mann, with another political jargon buster.
###74 What is the fiscal cliff? It is shorthand for the potential economic disaster that`s
###80 facing Washington. In real terms, it`s the $7 trillion in spending cuts and tax increases
###86 scheduled to go into effect the beginning of January. President and members of Congress
###92 set the deadline themselves last year after they failed to agree on how to reduce the
###97 U.S. debt. Now, time is almost up, and Democrats and Republicans remain far apart on a deal
###102 that would reduce the deficit, reform the tax system and U.S. entitlement programs like
###108 Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Analysts warn if there is no agreement, it could cripple
###113 the U.S. economy and drive up unemployment. Will the political standoff turn into an economic
###119 disaster? U.S. politicians hope to avoid running off the fiscal cliff.
###125 (END VIDEOTAPE)
###126 AZUZ: As they work to avoid running off that cliff, one of the other things that politicians
###131 will focus on is how much money Americans pay in taxes. For anyone making less than
###136 $250,000 a year, Republicans and Democrats want tax rates to stay the same, to stay where
###142 they are, but when it comes to those who make more than $250,000, President Obama says they
###148 should pay more in taxes. Republican leaders, like House Speaker John Boehner say they don`t
###153 want anyone`s taxes to go up.

###157 BAN KI-MOON, U.N. SECRETARY GENERAL: Education is a fundamental human right. It is a pathway
###164 to development, tolerance and global citizenship. Join us in our campaign to put education first,
###172 for Malala and girls and boys throughout the world.
###177 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###180 AZUZ: All right. You heard U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon mention the name Malala.
###187 He was talking about Malala Yousufzai. She is the Pakistani teenager who was shot by
###192 the Taliban because she stood up for education rights for girls. Her efforts and the attack
###197 on her gained international attention, and the United Nations declared November 10 as
###202 Malala Day. In her home country of Pakistan, people marked the day by lighting candles
###207 and holding vigils in Malala`s honor. Meanwhile, she isn`t in her home country. After the attack,
###212 Malala was transported to a hospital in England for special treatment. Dan Rivers tells us
###217 how recovery is going.
###219 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
###219 DAN RIVERS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It is staggering to see Malala Yousufzai out of bed, with her
###225 father looking through some of the thousands of get-well cards she`s received. It`s exactly
###231 a month since she was shot at pointblank range by Taliban gunmen for her campaign for girls
###237 education in Pakistan.
###239 Despite the bullet passing through her head and neck, she is able to talk. Doctors at
###244 Birmingham`s Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Britain are still assessing the extent of the brain
###248 damage. Her only visitors so far have been her immediate family.
###252 ZIAUDDIN YOUSUFZAI, MALALA`S FATHER: I`m awfully thankful to all peace-loving well wishers
###257 of Malala Yousufzai, who strongly condemn the assassination attempt on Malala, who pray
###265 for her health, and who support the great cause of Malala Yousufzai, that is peace,
###273 education, freedom of thought and freedom of expression.
###276 RIVERS: The cards have come from all over the world. This one from Myanmar or Burma.
###282 Some are signed by entire households, some by entire offices. Her story has touched people
###288 around the world. And there is now an Internet campaign for Malala to win the Nobel Peace
###294 Prize. She`s yet to undergo surgery for her skull and jaw in Britain, but judging by these
###300 pictures, she is in very good hands, surprising everyone with her determination to recover.
###307 Dan Rivers, CNN, London.

###323 AZUZ: Americans celebrated Veterans Day yesterday, honoring the men and women who`ve served in
###330 the U.S. armed forces. Events and parades like this on in Atlanta took place across
###335 the country. President Obama was part of the wreath laying ceremony at Arlington National
###340 Cemetery. During a speech afterward, he talked about America`s commitment to those who have
###344 served.
###344 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
###345 BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE U.S.: Each year, on the 11th day of the 11th month, we
###352 pause as a nation and as a people to pay tribute to you, to thank you, to honor you, the heroes
###364 over the generations who have served this country of ours with distinction.
###368 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###368 AZUZ: The Purple Heart is America`s oldest military medal. It is awarded to men and women
###375 who have been killed or wounded in action against an enemy of the United States. Now,
###380 over time, some of the Purple Hearts that had been awarded had been lost, but there
###384 is one National Guardsman who is trying to get some of these medals returned back home.
###389 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
###390 BARBARA MACNEVIN, DAUGHTER OF PURPLE HEART RECEPIENT: My dad, Ralph W. Bingham (ph).
###394 He was the veteran of the first world war, the big war. He lost his right leg fighting
###400 in France, and he received a Purple Heart for that. We had it for many years in my home,
###406 where I grew up.
###407 ROBERT MACNEVIN, GRANDSON OF PURPLE HEART RECEPIENT: Unbeknownst to us, it was lost
###409 in some manner in one his moves later in his life.
###413 CAPT. ZACHARIAH FIKE, U.S. ARMY: I found Private Ralph W. Bingham`s medal on Craigslist. This
###419 has been the calling of mine for about the last three years. I locate lost or stolen
###424 medals. These are all the Purple Hearts that I`m currently working. Some I`ve located to
###429 families, some I haven`t.
###431 I do these on my own time. I don`t consider it a hobby. It`s more of a calling and an
###435 honor. I myself have a Purple Heart. It hangs on the wall in my mother`s home, and I would
###440 hope that one day, if my medal was lost, someone would do the same thing for me and my family.
###446 It is truly an honor to bring Private Bingham`s Purple Heart home to his family, and I am
###452 again truly humbled by his sacrifice.
###454 It is a great honor to bring home his Purple Heart. Thank you very much.
###458 B. MACNEVIN: The medal means a lot to me, especially, and to our family.
###463 FIKE: I`m glad it is home to where it belongs, and I`ll move on to the next medal.
###472 (END VIDEOTAPE)
###474 AZUZ: Imagine creating something that you intend to share with the world, but then it
###478 sits on the shelf for more than 60 years. As World War II was winding down, U.S. Army
###483 Colonel stationed in the States composed a symphony, but no one ever played it until
###488 now.
###489 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
###494 (MUSIC)
###495 COL. HAROLD VAN HUEVELEN (RET.), COMPOSER: Wonderful!
###506 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###510 AZUZ: That was the symphony that Colonel Harold Van Huevelen wrote in 1945. That was the composer
###517 himself, listening to the U.S. Army Band perform his peace earlier this month. He`s 93 years
###523 old now and traveled across the country for the performance. Colonel Van Huevelen says
###527 that the symphony tells the story of the war, and it concludes with the peace that had been
###532 announced just before he wrote it. Of course, a lot of us here at CNN STUDENT NEWS offer
###537 our thanks to America`s veterans. We`re going to end today`s show with some images from
###541 Veterans Day events around the U.S. We`ll see you again tomorrow for more CNN STUDENT
###545 NEWS.
