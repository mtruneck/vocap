SO BEAUTIFUL"]

0:0:46,7 --> 0:1:44,506



4
0:1:44,506 --> 0:1:54,83



5
0:1:54,83 --> 0:1:56,92
FEMALE SPEAKER: Hi!


6
0:1:56,92 --> 0:1:57,5
FEMALE SPEAKER: Are you OK?


7
0:1:57,5 --> 0:1:58,82
FEMALE SPEAKER: Sorry
I'm a bit late.


8
0:1:58,82 --> 0:2:1,23
I had to pick up the tan.


9
0:2:1,23 --> 0:2:2,9
The tan injections.


10
0:2:2,9 --> 0:2:4,9
I have run out of
tan injections.


11
0:2:4,9 --> 0:2:7,39
INTERVIEWER: Where do
you get them from?


12
0:2:7,39 --> 0:2:9,345
FEMALE SPEAKER: Someone
that sells steroids.


13
0:2:9,345 --> 0:2:12,56
INTERVIEWER: Are you like a
celebrity in Liverpool, then?


14
0:2:12,56 --> 0:2:14,67
FEMALE SPEAKER: No, I'm not
what you call a celebrity.


15
0:2:14,67 --> 0:2:15,92
[INAUDIBLE]


16
0:2:15,92 --> 0:2:17,2



17
0:2:17,2 --> 0:2:19,2
I do little bits.


18
0:2:19,2 --> 0:2:19,89
Is it up this way?


19
0:2:19,89 --> 0:2:21,2
No.


20
0:2:21,2 --> 0:2:24,18
I do little bits like
TV and modeling.


21
0:2:24,18 --> 0:2:27,985
And got my own website
and things like that.


22
0:2:27,985 --> 0:2:31,91
When anything tends to focus
around Liverpool, they always


23
0:2:31,91 --> 0:2:33,48
get me involved.


24
0:2:33,48 --> 0:2:35,25
Maybe because I represent
something


25
0:2:35,25 --> 0:2:36,93
about Liverpool, probably.


26
0:2:36,93 --> 0:2:39,19
INTERVIEWER: What do you think
you represent about Liverpool?


27
0:2:39,19 --> 0:2:42,55
FEMALE SPEAKER: I'd like to
say it was vibrancy and


28
0:2:42,55 --> 0:2:44,7
enthusiasm, et cetera.


29
0:2:44,7 --> 0:2:48,485
But it's probably because they
think I'm quite vain, or


30
0:2:48,485 --> 0:2:49,17
something like that.


31
0:2:49,17 --> 0:2:51,595
They think Liverpool is quite
a vain city, don't they?


32
0:2:51,595 --> 0:2:59,95



33
0:2:59,95 --> 0:3:2,1
MALE SPEAKER: This is Face
Fashion, which is an event in


34
0:3:2,1 --> 0:3:3,78
aid of Liverpool Unites.


35
0:3:3,78 --> 0:3:6,7
We are the official charity
of Liverpool Echo.


36
0:3:6,7 --> 0:3:8,48
We were formed in the wake of
the murder of Rhys Jones.


37
0:3:8,48 --> 0:3:12,41
Rhys Jones was a local
schoolboy, who was 11 at the


38
0:3:12,41 --> 0:3:14,375
time, and he was murdered.


39
0:3:14,375 --> 0:3:17,51
He was caught up in the
crossfire of, basically,


40
0:3:17,51 --> 0:3:20,1
gang-related shooting, where
there was a bullet intended


41
0:3:20,1 --> 0:3:21,72
for one gang from the other.


42
0:3:21,72 --> 0:3:24,26
And he got caught in crossfire
just walking home from


43
0:3:24,26 --> 0:3:25,51
football practice.


44
0:3:25,51 --> 0:3:27,8



45
0:3:27,8 --> 0:3:29,7
INTERVIEWER: How much hairspray
does it normally


46
0:3:29,7 --> 0:3:30,42
take to keep it--


47
0:3:30,42 --> 0:3:30,87
FEMALE SPEAKER: A lot.


48
0:3:30,87 --> 0:3:33,3
Yeah, she used a full bottle
on the photo shoot we


49
0:3:33,3 --> 0:3:34,5
did the other day.


50
0:3:34,5 --> 0:3:35,27
A full bottle like that.


51
0:3:35,27 --> 0:3:35,9
FEMALE SPEAKER: Like that big.


52
0:3:35,9 --> 0:3:36,855
FEMALE SPEAKER: It was even
bigger, wasn't it?


53
0:3:36,855 --> 0:3:38,105
The Elnett one.


54
0:3:38,105 --> 0:3:43,7



55
0:3:43,7 --> 0:3:44,94
RICK VAUGHN: If you want to do
this differently, you tell me.


56
0:3:44,94 --> 0:3:46,58
I'll go on stage and say,
good evening, everyone.


57
0:3:46,58 --> 0:3:48,34
I'm Rick Vaughn from
Radio City.


58
0:3:48,34 --> 0:3:50,66
Please welcome my host for
this half of the show.


59
0:3:50,66 --> 0:3:51,67
And bring you on stage.


60
0:3:51,67 --> 0:3:52,8
Is that all right?


61
0:3:52,8 --> 0:3:52,81
AMANDA HARRINGTON: Yeah, yeah.


62
0:3:52,81 --> 0:3:55,12
RICK VAUGHN: Amanda Harrington,
is that all right?


63
0:3:55,12 --> 0:3:55,51
AMANDA HARRINGTON:
That's fine.


64
0:3:55,51 --> 0:3:57,745
RICK VAUGHN: I'll explain
about the charity angle.


65
0:3:57,745 --> 0:4:1,24
OK, and about exactly why we're
here, how much raffle


66
0:4:1,24 --> 0:4:3,812
and all that sort of stuff, the
great entertainment we got


67
0:4:3,812 --> 0:4:5,69
coming up, and all that.


68
0:4:5,69 --> 0:4:8,33
And listen to how loud I am and
think, fuck, I've got to


69
0:4:8,33 --> 0:4:9,58
be as loud as him.


70
0:4:9,58 --> 0:4:13,33



71
0:4:13,33 --> 0:4:14,86
FEMALE SPEAKER: No better
work than charity work.


72
0:4:14,86 --> 0:4:18,579
The kicks you get off it, it's
just worth more than


73
0:4:18,579 --> 0:4:19,459
anything, isn't it?


74
0:4:19,459 --> 0:4:20,6
FEMALE SPEAKER: Sometimes it's
better to give than to


75
0:4:20,6 --> 0:4:22,19
receive, isn't it?


76
0:4:22,19 --> 0:4:23,13
INTERVIEWER: How do you
two know each other?


77
0:4:23,13 --> 0:4:24,26
FEMALE SPEAKER: We're
actually family.


78
0:4:24,26 --> 0:4:25,98
We're cousins.


79
0:4:25,98 --> 0:4:28,83
FEMALE SPEAKER: I make the
clothes, and she models them.


80
0:4:28,83 --> 0:4:30,34
INTERVIEWER: Have you
got a label name?


81
0:4:30,34 --> 0:4:31,48
FEMALE SPEAKER: Dare to Bare.


82
0:4:31,48 --> 0:4:32,68
INTERVIEWER: Dirty Bird?


83
0:4:32,68 --> 0:4:35,7
FEMALE SPEAKER: No, Dare to
Bare, not Dirty Mare.


84
0:4:35,7 --> 0:4:38,85
It's Dare to Bare for
all the dirty mares.


85
0:4:38,85 --> 0:4:41,386
FEMALE SPEAKER: He said,
Dirty Bird, then.


86
0:4:41,386 --> 0:4:43,98
FEMALE SPEAKER: It's kind
of a wenchy, barn


87
0:4:43,98 --> 0:4:45,22
look going on today.


88
0:4:45,22 --> 0:4:46,651
INTERVIEWER: What made
you decide to do a


89
0:4:46,651 --> 0:4:48,56
wenchy, barn look?


90
0:4:48,56 --> 0:4:49,92
FEMALE SPEAKER: It's just
how I was feeling.


91
0:4:49,92 --> 0:4:52,51
The fact that you've gotta look
like you've been dragged


92
0:4:52,51 --> 0:4:53,816
out of a barn.


93
0:4:53,816 --> 0:4:56,96
INTERVIEWER: Why are Liverpool
women so glamorous?


94
0:4:56,96 --> 0:5:0,28
FEMALE SPEAKER: Because
we have no qualms.


95
0:5:0,28 --> 0:5:2,956
Up here it's any excuse to dress
up, even if it's just to


96
0:5:2,956 --> 0:5:4,2
go into to town shopping.


97
0:5:4,2 --> 0:5:6,4
You gotta wear your
heels to the Asda.


98
0:5:6,4 --> 0:5:8,86
No qualms in going shopping
[INAUDIBLE].


99
0:5:8,86 --> 0:5:11,396
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah, I go to
bed in my high heels, as well,


100
0:5:11,396 --> 0:5:12,646
just in case.


101
0:5:12,646 --> 0:5:15,13



102
0:5:15,13 --> 0:5:17,38
INTERVIEWER: What do you think
could possibly happen?


103
0:5:17,38 --> 0:5:18,64
FEMALE SPEAKER: Someone might
knock me up in the


104
0:5:18,64 --> 0:5:19,77
middle of the night.


105
0:5:19,77 --> 0:5:21,2
Gotta be ready.


106
0:5:21,2 --> 0:5:23,674



107
0:5:23,674 --> 0:5:24,924
You think I'm messing!


108
0:5:24,924 --> 0:5:28,83



109
0:5:28,83 --> 0:5:30,17
FEMALE SPEAKER: When we went
down to London a few weeks


110
0:5:30,17 --> 0:5:32,33
ago, everyone had jeans on.


111
0:5:32,33 --> 0:5:36,62
We had all over-the-top dresses
like my mum's clothes.


112
0:5:36,62 --> 0:5:39,68
And we went in the
Mayfair bar, and


113
0:5:39,68 --> 0:5:40,416
Vanessa Feltz walks in.


114
0:5:40,416 --> 0:5:42,69
She was like, oh my god,
your dress is amazing.


115
0:5:42,69 --> 0:5:44,21
And was like asking us.


116
0:5:44,21 --> 0:5:46,46
Everyone was staring at us
when we were down there


117
0:5:46,46 --> 0:5:48,555
because nobody wears
clothes like that.


118
0:5:48,555 --> 0:6:8,23



119
0:6:8,23 --> 0:6:9,3
FEMALE SPEAKER: I did
another shoot last


120
0:6:9,3 --> 0:6:10,85
night for my calendar.


121
0:6:10,85 --> 0:6:13,1
So that's nearly done.


122
0:6:13,1 --> 0:6:15,65
I'm doing a calendar to raise
money for Help For Heroes.


123
0:6:15,65 --> 0:6:16,56
You know, for the soldiers.


124
0:6:16,56 --> 0:6:19,9
I went to an awards with my
boyfriend once in London.


125
0:6:19,9 --> 0:6:22,6
And there was a group of young
lads sitting next to us.


126
0:6:22,6 --> 0:6:23,92
And they were soldiers.


127
0:6:23,92 --> 0:6:27,58
And some of them had no legs, no
arms, and stuff like that.


128
0:6:27,58 --> 0:6:29,42
They were only about 18, 19.


129
0:6:29,42 --> 0:6:30,87
I just thought it was
just dead sad.


130
0:6:30,87 --> 0:6:34,7
And I just thought, what can
I do to help them and raise


131
0:6:34,7 --> 0:6:35,58
money for them, or whatever.


132
0:6:35,58 --> 0:6:36,875
And I just came up with this.


133
0:6:36,875 --> 0:6:37,65
It's glamorous.


134
0:6:37,65 --> 0:6:39,79
It's not like topless or
anything like that.


135
0:6:39,79 --> 0:6:41,8
It's classy.


136
0:6:41,8 --> 0:6:43,56
And it's based on weather
scenes, really.


137
0:6:43,56 --> 0:6:45,71
It's all about nature
and stuff like that.


138
0:6:45,71 --> 0:6:46,65
So it's different.


139
0:6:46,65 --> 0:6:47,97
It's unique.


140
0:6:47,97 --> 0:6:51,25
There's one where I'm holding
a big snake in the jungle.


141
0:6:51,25 --> 0:6:53,14
And then there's another one
where I'm lying on loads of


142
0:6:53,14 --> 0:6:55,4
ice and stuff like that.


143
0:6:55,4 --> 0:6:56,2
Another one, I'm coming
out of a lily.


144
0:6:56,2 --> 0:6:58,528
So it's all based on
nature, really.


145
0:6:58,528 --> 0:7:1,18
RICK VAUGHN: I'll tell
you what, superb.


146
0:7:1,18 --> 0:7:3,1
[INAUDIBLE], kid.


147
0:7:3,1 --> 0:7:5,2
Absolutely superb.


148
0:7:5,2 --> 0:7:5,998
Right, OK.


149
0:7:5,998 --> 0:7:9,484
So listen, let's get some
more entertainment on.


150
0:7:9,484 --> 0:7:10,48
Make some noise!


151
0:7:10,48 --> 0:7:38,94
[MUSIC]


152
0:7:38,94 --> 0:7:41,38
MALE SPEAKER: Had that
for 45 years.


153
0:7:41,38 --> 0:7:43,1
That's been 45 years old.


154
0:7:43,1 --> 0:7:44,84
All of them have been with
me for-- there's my


155
0:7:44,84 --> 0:7:45,84
mum's wedding ring.


156
0:7:45,84 --> 0:7:47,83
But I think that's why they
call it the Bling Bling


157
0:7:47,83 --> 0:7:50,38
Building because something
to do with me


158
0:7:50,38 --> 0:7:51,7
being the king of bling.


159
0:7:51,7 --> 0:7:54,846
So we'll take you through.


160
0:7:54,846 --> 0:7:58,46
And on a personal note, when
I was 15, I used to


161
0:7:58,46 --> 0:8:0,1
love going in lifts.


162
0:8:0,1 --> 0:8:1,423
You'd work the lift yourself.


163
0:8:1,423 --> 0:8:2,39
FEMALE SPEAKER: What
did you do?


164
0:8:2,39 --> 0:8:3,891
MALE SPEAKER: Well, you
have gates and you'd


165
0:8:3,891 --> 0:8:5,16
pull the gates across.


166
0:8:5,16 --> 0:8:8,29
And I was just fascinated
with these lifts.


167
0:8:8,29 --> 0:8:10,78
And those were the days where,
you know, chauffeur driven


168
0:8:10,78 --> 0:8:12,8
limousines.


169
0:8:12,8 --> 0:8:15,88
You could not walk up Bold
Street a lady unless you had,


170
0:8:15,88 --> 0:8:19,48
maybe, a crocodile handbag
and shoes.


171
0:8:19,48 --> 0:8:21,92
It was very much like
Old Bond Street.


172
0:8:21,92 --> 0:8:24,46
I mean, my parents would never
walk up Bold Street.


173
0:8:24,46 --> 0:8:26,13
It was too posh.


174
0:8:26,13 --> 0:8:30,61
If you went to a tea room, the
ladies would be in the


175
0:8:30,61 --> 0:8:34,72
pinnies, and the hair,
and all silverware.


176
0:8:34,72 --> 0:8:37,28
There was the Best Dressed Man
in Bold Street at the time,


177
0:8:37,28 --> 0:8:40,0
and I think it went to a
hairdresser called Antoine.


178
0:8:40,0 --> 0:8:41,35
And he came from Switzerland.


179
0:8:41,35 --> 0:8:43,1
And he used to walk
up and down Bold


180
0:8:43,1 --> 0:8:43,83
Street with a poodle.


181
0:8:43,83 --> 0:8:46,82
Because I had a nightclub called
Hollywood in the '80s


182
0:8:46,82 --> 0:8:49,42
and we had the riots then.


183
0:8:49,42 --> 0:8:51,816
And they were coming
down from Toxteth.


184
0:8:51,816 --> 0:8:55,39
And people were rioting
for different reasons.


185
0:8:55,39 --> 0:8:58,32
All for people who didn't want
to work, and for people who


186
0:8:58,32 --> 0:9:0,51
did work, we were
all penalized.


187
0:9:0,51 --> 0:9:3,97
So we lost the shipping because
of the dockers strikes


188
0:9:3,97 --> 0:9:4,8
all the time.


189
0:9:4,8 --> 0:9:8,14
So once you lost the shipping,
that was really the heart of


190
0:9:8,14 --> 0:9:10,24
our Liverpool docks, really.


191
0:9:10,24 --> 0:9:11,815
And that was a bad time.


192
0:9:11,815 --> 0:9:14,87
But the hairdressing industry
was very, very upmarket.


193
0:9:14,87 --> 0:9:16,79
You know, to be a hairdresser
in those days was marvelous


194
0:9:16,79 --> 0:9:19,45
because it took you five
years as an apprentice.


195
0:9:19,45 --> 0:9:21,41
These days, it's cut and
blow drying, and


196
0:9:21,41 --> 0:9:22,68
monkeys can do that.


197
0:9:22,68 --> 0:9:23,87
I've got my own lift.


198
0:9:23,87 --> 0:9:26,31
Come on downstairs.


199
0:9:26,31 --> 0:9:29,97
Botox should only be either
administered by a qualified


200
0:9:29,97 --> 0:9:33,63
cosmetic surgeon or a dentist.


201
0:9:33,63 --> 0:9:36,21
It's like everything else
in Liverpool, you know?


202
0:9:36,21 --> 0:9:38,58
The cowboys start to
get onto the--


203
0:9:38,58 --> 0:9:40,7
everyone wants to cut
price each other.


204
0:9:40,7 --> 0:9:45,16
I mean, I don't know so much
about cosmetic surgery.


205
0:9:45,16 --> 0:9:47,63
Although, I've had a bit.


206
0:9:47,63 --> 0:9:50,97
I had it done about
10 years ago.


207
0:9:50,97 --> 0:9:55,16
And then I was in pantomime
with Julie Goodyear as the


208
0:9:55,16 --> 0:9:56,89
emperor in Aladdin.


209
0:9:56,89 --> 0:9:59,796
And I couldn't move my face.


210
0:9:59,796 --> 0:10:3,2
So when you're trying to express
yourself, acting, I


211
0:10:3,2 --> 0:10:3,97
was like that.


212
0:10:3,97 --> 0:10:6,1
[INAUDIBLE]


213
0:10:6,1 --> 0:10:8,16
Well, I couldn't stand that
either like that.


214
0:10:8,16 --> 0:10:10,565
INTERVIEWER: Would you
ever consider it?


215
0:10:10,565 --> 0:10:11,55
FEMALE SPEAKER: Oh, yeah,


216
0:10:11,55 --> 0:10:11,9
MALE SPEAKER: Of course.


217
0:10:11,9 --> 0:10:12,49
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah,
definitely.


218
0:10:12,49 --> 0:10:14,785
I feel like I need it quite
soon, to be honest.


219
0:10:14,785 --> 0:10:16,42
INTERVIEWER: How old
are you now then?


220
0:10:16,42 --> 0:10:18,502
FEMALE SPEAKER: 25.


221
0:10:18,502 --> 0:10:20,962
MALE SPEAKER: I do love
this lift, you know.


222
0:10:20,962 --> 0:10:23,914
Are you coming in?


223
0:10:23,914 --> 0:10:24,898
Feel it going up.


224
0:10:24,898 --> 0:10:26,148
[INAUDIBLE]


225
0:10:26,148 --> 0:10:30,802

[MUSIC]


227
0:10:46,56 --> 0:10:48,37
FEMALE SPEAKER: A lot of girls
in Liverpool will get their


228
0:10:48,37 --> 0:10:50,46
lips done for any occasion.


229
0:10:50,46 --> 0:10:52,81
It's like buying a
new dress now.


230
0:10:52,81 --> 0:10:55,77
There's a lot of competition
in Liverpool with Botox and


231
0:10:55,77 --> 0:10:56,8
dermal fillers.


232
0:10:56,8 --> 0:10:58,95
And the best is to
be reasonable.


233
0:10:58,95 --> 0:11:1,55
And I am probably
the cheapest.


234
0:11:1,55 --> 0:11:2,86
INTERVIEWER: How much?


235
0:11:2,86 --> 0:11:6,54
FEMALE SPEAKER: A full lip would
be 120, and that's a


236
0:11:6,54 --> 0:11:8,31
good price.


237
0:11:8,31 --> 0:11:11,93
The Botox is it's actually
a botulism.


238
0:11:11,93 --> 0:11:16,4
It's a poison that goes into
just the muscle, probably the


239
0:11:16,4 --> 0:11:20,385
upper face, frown lines,
forehead, eyes.


240
0:11:20,385 --> 0:11:24,13
And you inject the muscle, and
it just stops it working.


241
0:11:24,13 --> 0:11:26,14
INTERVIEWER: Have you ever
had this done before?


242
0:11:26,14 --> 0:11:28,14
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah, I've had
this done about three times.


243
0:11:28,14 --> 0:11:29,72
INTERVIEWER: How was it?


244
0:11:29,72 --> 0:11:31,34
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah,
I liked it.


245
0:11:31,34 --> 0:11:34,55
FEMALE SPEAKER: You can only
put so much in, I think.


246
0:11:34,55 --> 0:11:36,747
OK, I'll just do a little
on this side here.


247
0:11:36,747 --> 0:11:41,54



248
0:11:41,54 --> 0:11:43,17
INTERVIEWER: Where does
the hair come from?


249
0:11:43,17 --> 0:11:44,42
FEMALE SPEAKER: Russia,
with love.


250
0:11:44,42 --> 0:11:51,47



251
0:11:51,47 --> 0:11:52,82
INTERVIEWER: Is it weird to
think you're walking around


252
0:11:52,82 --> 0:11:55,348
with a Russian's hair in?


253
0:11:55,348 --> 0:11:55,784
FEMALE SPEAKER: No.


254
0:11:55,784 --> 0:11:57,97
It's weird to think there's a
Russian walking around bald.


255
0:11:57,97 --> 0:12:10,11



256
0:12:10,11 --> 0:12:12,32
FEMALE SPEAKER: We sell 100%
human hair, all different


257
0:12:12,32 --> 0:12:14,42
qualities, lengths, colors.


258
0:12:14,42 --> 0:12:17,39
And we sell curly hair,
straight hair,


259
0:12:17,39 --> 0:12:18,65
relaxed Afro hair.


260
0:12:18,65 --> 0:12:22,14
And we also do synthetic, human
hair wigs, lace front


261
0:12:22,14 --> 0:12:26,37
wigs, ponytails, all accessories
and stuff to go


262
0:12:26,37 --> 0:12:27,38
with the hair.


263
0:12:27,38 --> 0:12:30,762
This is the most popular color
of blonde because it's


264
0:12:30,762 --> 0:12:31,655
different shades.


265
0:12:31,655 --> 0:12:34,25
And that's 100% human hair.


266
0:12:34,25 --> 0:12:35,5
So it's fitted there.


267
0:12:35,5 --> 0:12:37,54
So it gets sewn in.


268
0:12:37,54 --> 0:12:39,106
FEMALE SPEAKER: I would like
to go to dark because I'm


269
0:12:39,106 --> 0:12:41,15
loving Katie Price's dark
hair at the minute.


270
0:12:41,15 --> 0:12:41,83
But every time--


271
0:12:41,83 --> 0:12:43,14
I've been wearing a wig,
haven't I, for


272
0:12:43,14 --> 0:12:43,74
the last few weeks.


273
0:12:43,74 --> 0:12:46,9
FEMALE SPEAKER: She ordered a
brunette wig, the Joanna wig.


274
0:12:46,9 --> 0:12:47,53
FEMALE SPEAKER: Coming to work
in the morning, popping a wig


275
0:12:47,53 --> 0:12:49,25
on, trying to get used to it.


276
0:12:49,25 --> 0:12:51,31
But when I went home,
my husband hated it.


277
0:12:51,31 --> 0:12:53,8
Joanna was my favorite.


278
0:12:53,8 --> 0:12:56,74
I was going for Joanna.


279
0:12:56,74 --> 0:12:58,38
I wanted to be a racy redhead.


280
0:12:58,38 --> 0:12:59,78
FEMALE SPEAKER: This is the
half head wig, which


281
0:12:59,78 --> 0:13:0,62
is not a full wig.


282
0:13:0,62 --> 0:13:4,68
So when you've got it on, it
goes like about there.


283
0:13:4,68 --> 0:13:6,85
And you have all your own
hair over the top of it.


284
0:13:6,85 --> 0:13:7,9
INTERVIEWER: Do you
think the beauty


285
0:13:7,9 --> 0:13:8,66
industry is getting bigger?


286
0:13:8,66 --> 0:13:9,72
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah,
a lot bigger.


287
0:13:9,72 --> 0:13:11,26
Especially in Liverpool.


288
0:13:11,26 --> 0:13:12,615
INTERVIEWER: What percentage
of girls, do you think, in


289
0:13:12,615 --> 0:13:14,505
Liverpool have hair
extensions?


290
0:13:14,505 --> 0:13:16,42
FEMALE SPEAKER: A
hell of a lot.


291
0:13:16,42 --> 0:13:17,71
FEMALE SPEAKER: I'd
say about 70%.


292
0:13:17,71 --> 0:13:18,52
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.


293
0:13:18,52 --> 0:13:19,3
FEMALE SPEAKER: Definitely.


294
0:13:19,3 --> 0:13:23,54
I can't believe that we're in
a credit crunch and how many


295
0:13:23,54 --> 0:13:26,79
young girls come in and think
nothing of spending 80 pounds


296
0:13:26,79 --> 0:13:28,49
on their hair extensions.


297
0:13:28,49 --> 0:13:30,33
They just come in, and they
say, you know what we want


298
0:13:30,33 --> 0:13:31,68
because they get it every
six, eight weeks.


299
0:13:31,68 --> 0:13:34,12
And they say, I'll have two
packets of that, and they hand


300
0:13:34,12 --> 0:13:35,18
the money over.


301
0:13:35,18 --> 0:13:36,92
INTERVIEWER: Do you go
to tanning salons?


302
0:13:36,92 --> 0:13:38,46
FEMALE SPEAKER: After the big
scare with skin cancer and


303
0:13:38,46 --> 0:13:40,84
stuff like that, I have been
sticking to false tan.


304
0:13:40,84 --> 0:13:42,12
As you can tell.


305
0:13:42,12 --> 0:13:44,11
FEMALE SPEAKER: I feel, like,
really a lot paler now, but I


306
0:13:44,11 --> 0:13:46,1
think they're trying to promote
that aren't they?


307
0:13:46,1 --> 0:13:47,63
FEMALE SPEAKER: And this has
been really popular.


308
0:13:47,63 --> 0:13:49,77
Most celebrities use it.


309
0:13:49,77 --> 0:13:52,29
This is the one that
I actually use.


310
0:13:52,29 --> 0:13:58,19
It's voted Bazaar Best
of the Best 2009.


311
0:13:58,19 --> 0:13:59,67
Orange knuckles and white
fingers today.


312
0:13:59,67 --> 0:14:1,17
FEMALE SPEAKER: We have been
trying to scrub her all


313
0:14:1,17 --> 0:14:2,2
morning to get it off.


314
0:14:2,2 --> 0:14:2,72
FEMALE SPEAKER: We'll
be scrubbing


315
0:14:2,72 --> 0:14:3,72
more before I go out.


316
0:14:3,72 --> 0:14:4,25
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah


317
0:14:4,25 --> 0:14:5,69
INTERVIEWER: Why do you
feel the need to be


318
0:14:5,69 --> 0:14:6,87
tanned all the time?


319
0:14:6,87 --> 0:14:7,895
FEMALE SPEAKER: Because
I felt dead pale


320
0:14:7,895 --> 0:14:10,2
and sick this morning.


321
0:14:10,2 --> 0:14:12,22
So when I've got it on, I feel
like I've just come back from


322
0:14:12,22 --> 0:14:13,335
my holiday when I look
in the mirror.


323
0:14:13,335 --> 0:14:14,675
FEMALE SPEAKER: When you've
got pale, fat


324
0:14:14,675 --> 0:14:15,73
skin it looks horrible.


325
0:14:15,73 --> 0:14:18,95
Tan, fat skin doesn't look as
bad, on your bum and stuff.


326
0:14:18,95 --> 0:14:23,41



327
0:14:23,41 --> 0:14:25,63
FEMALE SPEAKER: I started using
Melanotan about a year


328
0:14:25,63 --> 0:14:28,84
ago because I was fed up
with getting spray


329
0:14:28,84 --> 0:14:30,16
tans all the time.


330
0:14:30,16 --> 0:14:32,59
Now, I've tried every
kind of a spray tan.


331
0:14:32,59 --> 0:14:36,55
Like the one I'm using at the
moment, which is the Su-do Tan


332
0:14:36,55 --> 0:14:39,2
or the California Tan, they're
about the best of a bad bunch,


333
0:14:39,2 --> 0:14:41,6
where they don't really
start to come off.


334
0:14:41,6 --> 0:14:44,8
But no spray tan lasts
a week for a start.


335
0:14:44,8 --> 0:14:45,93
So nothing's ever permanent.


336
0:14:45,93 --> 0:14:51,99
You can never get a tan that's
permanent or tan that's real.


337
0:14:51,99 --> 0:14:56,55
Melanotan is like a natural
source of tanning by making


338
0:14:56,55 --> 0:14:58,3
you produce something
in your body.


339
0:14:58,3 --> 0:15:0,87
I still get top ups and get
spray tans, of I still put on


340
0:15:0,87 --> 0:15:3,3
a bit of instant tan.


341
0:15:3,3 --> 0:15:4,41
You know, when I go out?


342
0:15:4,41 --> 0:15:8,64
But the only reason I use the
Melanotan is because it gives


343
0:15:8,64 --> 0:15:10,19
you pigments in your skin.


344
0:15:10,19 --> 0:15:12,1
It's like a top up for the
sunbeds, isn't it?


345
0:15:12,1 --> 0:15:14,84
It's like using a sunbed
cream inside your skin.


346
0:15:14,84 --> 0:15:15,61
INTERVIEWER: Does it
have any other


347
0:15:15,61 --> 0:15:19,33
effects apart from tanning?


348
0:15:19,33 --> 0:15:20,83
FEMALE SPEAKER: Does it have
any other effects?


349
0:15:20,83 --> 0:15:22,96
It makes you feel sick.


350
0:15:22,96 --> 0:15:26,55
Well, it makes you feel
nauseous, like a sort of


351
0:15:26,55 --> 0:15:28,47
travel sick.


352
0:15:28,47 --> 0:15:32,19
Whenever you start using them,
you always have your 10ml


353
0:15:32,19 --> 0:15:33,75
before you go to bed.


354
0:15:33,75 --> 0:15:35,83
Some people only start
off with 5ml.


355
0:15:35,83 --> 0:15:38,57
If you have 10ml before you go
to bed, you sleep through most


356
0:15:38,57 --> 0:15:39,54
of the sickness.


357
0:15:39,54 --> 0:15:41,34
But to be perfectly honest with
you, when you start off


358
0:15:41,34 --> 0:15:44,396
using them, they make you
feel sick all the time.


359
0:15:44,396 --> 0:15:45,842
INTERVIEWER: Some people get
it off the internet.


360
0:15:45,842 --> 0:15:48,7
Where do you get yours
from again?


361
0:15:48,7 --> 0:15:50,27
FEMALE SPEAKER: I get
mine from a--


362
0:15:50,27 --> 0:15:52,64
well, a person.


363
0:15:52,64 --> 0:15:54,53
They don't sell them on show.


364
0:15:54,53 --> 0:15:56,94
But if you know a person in a
gym, they'll probably sell


365
0:15:56,94 --> 0:15:59,45
them if they sell steroids.


366
0:15:59,45 --> 0:16:3,15
Just because it goes hand in
hand with injecting yourself


367
0:16:3,15 --> 0:16:5,42
with steroids, sort of thing,
really, isn't it?


368
0:16:5,42 --> 0:16:9,79
It's also not a narcotic, it's
like putting a drug in your


369
0:16:9,79 --> 0:16:13,295
body but it's not for
social purposes.

ALEX LARGE: Hi my name is Alex
Large, and today we're here at


373
0:16:30,31 --> 0:16:34,1
the Mr. Liverpool contest,
here at the Plaza Cinema.


374
0:16:34,1 --> 0:16:36,73
Today we're hoping for a really
good day as a show for


375
0:16:36,73 --> 0:16:37,52
bodybuilders.


376
0:16:37,52 --> 0:16:39,64
INTERVIEWER: So how's it changed
then over the years


377
0:16:39,64 --> 0:16:41,36
from when you used to do it?


378
0:16:41,36 --> 0:16:42,8
ALEX LARGE: Pretty much
the same, actually.


379
0:16:42,8 --> 0:16:45,22
There's no real difference,
except, really, the standards


380
0:16:45,22 --> 0:16:49,92
become higher, obviously, with
enhanced performance products.


381
0:16:49,92 --> 0:16:52,35
That has contributed to a
level of very, very high


382
0:16:52,35 --> 0:16:53,69
standard physique.


383
0:16:53,69 --> 0:16:54,27
INTERVIEWER: Are they
the polish that are


384
0:16:54,27 --> 0:16:54,75
standing out there?


385
0:16:54,75 --> 0:16:56,59
ALEX LARGE: No, I'm talking
about, obviously, you've got


386
0:16:56,59 --> 0:16:59,2
growth hormone involved
and things like that.


387
0:16:59,2 --> 0:17:3,3
Obviously, the media,
newspapers, and coverage is


388
0:17:3,3 --> 0:17:5,99
against the bodybuilding sport
because obviously it involves


389
0:17:5,99 --> 0:17:7,4
anabolic steroids.


390
0:17:7,4 --> 0:17:10,819
That's the killing point.


391
0:17:10,819 --> 0:17:11,2
All right, fella?


392
0:17:11,2 --> 0:17:11,99

0:17:17,52 --> 0:17:20,9
all connected for many years,
and obviously, competed for


398
0:17:20,9 --> 0:17:21,54
donkey's years.


399
0:17:21,54 --> 0:17:23,129
And now all the lads
are following suit.


400
0:17:23,129 --> 0:17:25,65
COLIN MATHIESON: See the thing
is, with bodybuilding, there's


401
0:17:25,65 --> 0:17:26,43
no age limit.


402
0:17:26,43 --> 0:17:29,57
People say certain sports and
you'll go, oh, I'm too old to


403
0:17:29,57 --> 0:17:30,865
do that sport.


404
0:17:30,865 --> 0:17:33,68
Now, you couldn't get, like, a
40-year old starting squash,


405
0:17:33,68 --> 0:17:37,23
or something like that, but if
you're 40, or you're 50, or


406
0:17:37,23 --> 0:17:39,47
even you're 60, to go into
bodybuilding, you're doing the


407
0:17:39,47 --> 0:17:41,98
same movements with your muscle
as a young person.


408
0:17:41,98 --> 0:17:43,87
But you're doing it
at your pace.


409
0:17:43,87 --> 0:17:47,6
So there's no age limit to
weightlifting or bodybuilding.


410
0:17:47,6 --> 0:17:48,79
You're not straining yourself
because you're not going to


411
0:17:48,79 --> 0:17:49,69
excess weights.


412
0:17:49,69 --> 0:17:53,41
INTERVIEWER: Do you mind me
asking how old you are?


413
0:17:53,41 --> 0:17:56,26
ALEX LARGE: I've told
him my age.


414
0:17:56,26 --> 0:17:59,5
COLIN MATHIESON: I'm 59.


415
0:17:59,5 --> 0:18:1,388
The proof of the pudding
is in the eating.


416
0:18:1,388 --> 0:18:4,7



417
0:18:4,7 --> 0:18:6,386
FEMALE SPEAKER: You
all right, pet?


418
0:18:6,386 --> 0:18:7,91
Are you outside?


419
0:18:7,91 --> 0:18:8,32
OK.


420
0:18:8,32 --> 0:18:10,89
Do you want to just nip
down with that?


421
0:18:10,89 --> 0:18:12,2
It's for Ben.


422
0:18:12,2 --> 0:18:12,72
Cheers, pet.


423
0:18:12,72 --> 0:18:13,71
Thanks, darling.


424
0:18:13,71 --> 0:18:15,53
Yes, Lynne's coming
down for you now.


425
0:18:15,53 --> 0:18:17,42
Steroids are very addictive.


426
0:18:17,42 --> 0:18:19,2
On the next day--


427
0:18:19,2 --> 0:18:23,53
when you've been taking
steroids, however briefly,


428
0:18:23,53 --> 0:18:25,32
even just after a couple
of days, three to


429
0:18:25,32 --> 0:18:27,4
five days, I'd say--


430
0:18:27,4 --> 0:18:30,76
the next day, when you wake up
and say, [INAUDIBLE], you


431
0:18:30,76 --> 0:18:34,723
actually get to the point in
that day when you feel like,


432
0:18:34,723 --> 0:18:37,25
oh, I need to take
my steroids.


433
0:18:37,25 --> 0:18:38,84
You actually have the
feeling within you.


434
0:18:38,84 --> 0:18:41,56
It's hard to explain, but
it's like your body's


435
0:18:41,56 --> 0:18:44,32
anticipating the rush.


436
0:18:44,32 --> 0:18:46,81
Then it's the aggressive,
because they're a big man,


437
0:18:46,81 --> 0:18:48,2
don't mess with me.


438
0:18:48,2 --> 0:18:50,45
As soon as they start working
out regularly, even if it's


439
0:18:50,45 --> 0:18:55,17
just cardiovascular stuff like
regular cycling, anything,


440
0:18:55,17 --> 0:18:55,81
that's fine.


441
0:18:55,81 --> 0:18:57,92
But some don't do
anything at all.


442
0:18:57,92 --> 0:19:1,23
And then it just goes to
flubber and the anger--


443
0:19:1,23 --> 0:19:7,384



444
0:19:7,384 --> 0:19:9,93
Hello?


445
0:19:9,93 --> 0:19:11,18
That was my chap.


446
0:19:11,18 --> 0:19:17,37



447
0:19:17,37 --> 0:19:19,11
MALE SPEAKER: Steroids
are everywhere.


448
0:19:19,11 --> 0:19:20,47
Police are using them.


449
0:19:20,47 --> 0:19:21,19
Everybody's using them.


450
0:19:21,19 --> 0:19:22,38
I'll tell you that, everybody.


451
0:19:22,38 --> 0:19:23,67
INTERVIEWER: What's
the expression?


452
0:19:23,67 --> 0:19:24,97
MALE SPEAKER: Sted head.


453
0:19:24,97 --> 0:19:28,27
That's what they call them Sted
heads or juice heads.


454
0:19:28,27 --> 0:19:29,49
INTERVIEWER: When did
you start getting


455
0:19:29,49 --> 0:19:31,55
into the steroid scene?


456
0:19:31,55 --> 0:19:32,57
MALE SPEAKER: I started
going to the gym


457
0:19:32,57 --> 0:19:34,85
when I was about 15.


458
0:19:34,85 --> 0:19:36,46
The people behind the counter
didn't really


459
0:19:36,46 --> 0:19:37,99
realize my real age.


460
0:19:37,99 --> 0:19:40,39
[INAUDIBLE]


461
0:19:40,39 --> 0:19:43,48
I was a young kid
with potential.


462
0:19:43,48 --> 0:19:47,655
When I first did
it, I injected.


463
0:19:47,655 --> 0:19:49,96
It kinda hurt, do you
know what I mean?


464
0:19:49,96 --> 0:19:51,54
Because it's a thick
liquid you're


465
0:19:51,54 --> 0:19:53,36
putting into your veins.


466
0:19:53,36 --> 0:19:54,74
It hurt quite a lot.


467
0:19:54,74 --> 0:19:58,83
So when I had been injected,
I was just on edge.


468
0:19:58,83 --> 0:20:1,94
Just a bit wary, [INAUDIBLE]


469
0:20:1,94 --> 0:20:2,64
do you know what I mean?


470
0:20:2,64 --> 0:20:4,48
I was just a bit scared
and wary, panicky.


471
0:20:4,48 --> 0:20:6,18
After I had seen it
was all right.


472
0:20:6,18 --> 0:20:8,13
You have six weeks off
and six weeks on.


473
0:20:8,13 --> 0:20:11,18
After I had seen that it was
OK, I felt all right.


474
0:20:11,18 --> 0:20:12,86
I started to feel
a [INAUDIBLE].


475
0:20:12,86 --> 0:20:16,103
When I started to take them
at the age of 16, I


476
0:20:16,103 --> 0:20:18,9
had bad anger problems.


477
0:20:18,9 --> 0:20:18,9
I kicked off.


478
0:20:18,9 --> 0:20:20,13
There's something called
roid rage.


479
0:20:20,13 --> 0:20:21,61
Have you heard of it?


480
0:20:21,61 --> 0:20:23,47
I was getting in trouble
with the police.


481
0:20:23,47 --> 0:20:25,9
Violence, I was having
arguments.


482
0:20:25,9 --> 0:20:28,93
I was having problems
with my girlfriend.


483
0:20:28,93 --> 0:20:30,4
Sometimes I was feeling like
I was getting suffocated,


484
0:20:30,4 --> 0:20:32,86
because my chest was up there.


485
0:20:32,86 --> 0:20:35,2
Sometimes I couldn't breathe.


486
0:20:35,2 --> 0:20:37,62
I felt like I was in a circus.


487
0:20:37,62 --> 0:20:40,695
I would walk around
town [INAUDIBLE]


488
0:20:40,695 --> 0:20:42,57
superstar, he's this,
he's that.


489
0:20:42,57 --> 0:20:46,33
But what I didn't like about it,
in the end, when I started


490
0:20:46,33 --> 0:20:49,33
to come off them is the simple
fact that you're


491
0:20:49,33 --> 0:20:51,65
obviously on steroids.


492
0:20:51,65 --> 0:20:53,44
You're not big because
you worked hard.


493
0:20:53,44 --> 0:20:55,88
You're big because you worked
half as hard as you should


494
0:20:55,88 --> 0:20:58,22
work, and you took stuff
to make you like that.


495
0:20:58,22 --> 0:20:58,665
It's abnormal.


496
0:20:58,665 --> 0:21:0,45
I felt like a freak show.


497
0:21:0,45 --> 0:21:1,795
FEMALE SPEAKER: Well, it's the
whole thing, isn't it?


498
0:21:1,795 --> 0:21:2,66
Scousers.


499
0:21:2,66 --> 0:21:5,9
It's to become more than
what they are.


500
0:21:5,9 --> 0:21:7,72
Guys are just really interested
in their vanity,


501
0:21:7,72 --> 0:21:10,24
and the way they look,
and girls, of course.


502
0:21:10,24 --> 0:21:12,615
That's where the aspect is
with the younger ones.


503
0:21:12,615 --> 0:21:13,45
It's to get the women.


504
0:21:13,45 --> 0:21:29,5
[MUSIC]


505
0:21:29,5 --> 0:21:30,63
MATT FISHER: Hi, I'm
Matt Fisher.


506
0:21:30,63 --> 0:21:32,14
I'm entering for
Mr. Liverpool.


507
0:21:32,14 --> 0:21:35,85
It's like a beauty contest
for male and female.


508
0:21:35,85 --> 0:21:39,79
You've got to show off your
personality, as well as what


509
0:21:39,79 --> 0:21:42,81
you should basically
appeal to be.


510
0:21:42,81 --> 0:21:46,43
Throughout the night we'll
be modelling beachwear.


511
0:21:46,43 --> 0:21:47,91
It's beachwear that
we've chosen.


512
0:21:47,91 --> 0:21:50,1
And then finally it'll
be the suits.


513
0:21:50,1 --> 0:21:54,92
Over the past two weeks we've
been choreographing routines.


514
0:21:54,92 --> 0:21:57,725
So it's kind of like dance
routines, press-ups.


515
0:21:57,725 --> 0:21:59,26
INTERVIEWER: What
are you doing?


516
0:21:59,26 --> 0:22:0,51
MATT FISHER: I do press-ups.


517
0:22:0,51 --> 0:22:2,525



518
0:22:2,525 --> 0:22:5,795
But there's one routine where
the lads have to do press-ups


519
0:22:5,795 --> 0:22:9,69
and one has to jump
over the other.


520
0:22:9,69 --> 0:22:11,816
I wish I could actually
eat at KFC.


521
0:22:11,816 --> 0:22:17,3



522
0:22:17,3 --> 0:22:19,896
I'm going to have a tan now,
a fake tan, a spray


523
0:22:19,896 --> 0:22:22,4
tan, my fake bake.


524
0:22:22,4 --> 0:22:23,8
FEMALE SPEAKER: This is
an inflatable machine.


525
0:22:23,8 --> 0:22:27,37
So I'm going to blow it up, and
then he'll get inside, and


526
0:22:27,37 --> 0:22:28,62
I'll start spraying you.


527
0:22:28,62 --> 0:22:31,832



528
0:22:31,832 --> 0:22:33,254
INTERVIEWER: Is that one
of your t-shirts?


529
0:22:33,254 --> 0:22:34,86
MATT FISHER: Yeah, this
is one of my t-shirts.


530
0:22:34,86 --> 0:22:40,95
It's a model image and I made
it into a chicken because I


531
0:22:40,95 --> 0:22:44,36
think this leg looks like
a wing, for some reason.


532
0:22:44,36 --> 0:22:45,99
So I made her into a chicken.


533
0:22:45,99 --> 0:22:48,74
Basically, she's had an egg.


534
0:22:48,74 --> 0:22:50,76
And the human fries the egg.


535
0:22:50,76 --> 0:22:53,79
I know it's pretty insane, but
that's what fashion's about.


536
0:22:53,79 --> 0:22:55,25
It's about making a statement.


537
0:22:55,25 --> 0:22:56,91
Sizzle, sizzle.


538
0:22:56,91 --> 0:22:59,23
Yeah, I've got my own website
at the moment,


539
0:22:59,23 --> 0:23:1,45
www.matt-fisher.com.


540
0:23:1,45 --> 0:23:5,7
But I've been building it up
over the past five months,


541
0:23:5,7 --> 0:23:8,1
because as soon as I got here,
it was my dream to build up


542
0:23:8,1 --> 0:23:11,5
something like that.


543
0:23:11,5 --> 0:23:13,96
My confidence has grown
so much in these past


544
0:23:13,96 --> 0:23:15,63
six months, as well.


545
0:23:15,63 --> 0:23:17,492
INTERVIEWER: What other beauty
treatments do you have apart


546
0:23:17,492 --> 0:23:19,12
from spray tan?


547
0:23:19,12 --> 0:23:20,59
MATT FISHER: I don't really
have a lot of beauty


548
0:23:20,59 --> 0:23:20,76
treatments.


549
0:23:20,76 --> 0:23:22,83
I mean, I used to
have facials.


550
0:23:22,83 --> 0:23:27,34
I used to have one where I had
to hold a metal stick, and


551
0:23:27,34 --> 0:23:29,86
they sent electrical currents
on my face.


552
0:23:29,86 --> 0:23:32,15
FEMALE SPEAKER: If you come
out on a Saturday night in


553
0:23:32,15 --> 0:23:33,81
Liverpool, you'll see
everyone all tidied


554
0:23:33,81 --> 0:23:36,1
up, hair done perfectly.


555
0:23:36,1 --> 0:23:38,37
They've got all the
nice accessories.


556
0:23:38,37 --> 0:23:38,89
They look amazing.


557
0:23:38,89 --> 0:23:42,135
They all look like stars.


558
0:23:42,135 --> 0:23:43,438
MATT FISHER: All sequins,
isn't it?


559
0:23:43,438 --> 0:23:44,902
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah, they
get dresses made.


560
0:23:44,902 --> 0:23:48,27
So you definitely want to
go with the dark tan?


561
0:23:48,27 --> 0:23:50,2
MATT FISHER: [INAUDIBLE]


562
0:23:50,2 --> 0:23:50,657
FEMALE SPEAKER: Pardon?


563
0:23:50,657 --> 0:23:52,942
MATT FISHER: Aren't you
dark to start with?


564
0:23:52,942 --> 0:23:56,1



565
0:23:56,1 --> 0:24:17,454
[MUSIC]


566
0:24:17,454 --> 0:24:20,436
MALE SPEAKER: Three, two, one.


567
0:24:20,436 --> 0:24:23,418



568
0:24:23,418 --> 0:24:24,909
Now, with your back straight.


569
0:24:24,909 --> 0:24:25,903
Head up.


570
0:24:25,903 --> 0:24:27,394
Awesome, good.


571
0:24:27,394 --> 0:24:28,885
One.


572
0:24:28,885 --> 0:24:29,879
Good technique.


573
0:24:29,879 --> 0:24:32,364
Two, control on the way down.


574
0:24:32,364 --> 0:24:32,861
Three.


575
0:24:32,861 --> 0:24:33,855
Easy?


576
0:24:33,855 --> 0:24:34,352
MATT FISHER: Yeah.


577
0:24:34,352 --> 0:24:35,602
MALE SPEAKER: Go to the
next weight up.


578
0:24:35,602 --> 0:24:38,34



579
0:24:38,34 --> 0:24:39,5
MATT FISHER: Liverpool is
very well known for


580
0:24:39,5 --> 0:24:41,43
the football teams.


581
0:24:41,43 --> 0:24:44,48
And football lifestyles
are very glamorous.


582
0:24:44,48 --> 0:24:48,5
And maybe the girls look up to
the glamour models that are


583
0:24:48,5 --> 0:24:50,8
already out there, and say,
I want to be like that.


584
0:24:50,8 --> 0:24:53,176
INTERVIEWER: There's a glamorous
model judging


585
0:24:53,176 --> 0:24:53,83
tonight, isn't there?


586
0:24:53,83 --> 0:24:55,15
MATT FISHER: Yeah, Amanda
Harrington.


587
0:24:55,15 --> 0:24:55,94
INTERVIEWER: Do you know her?


588
0:24:55,94 --> 0:24:56,335
MATT FISHER: Yeah.


589
0:24:56,335 --> 0:24:57,48
INTERVIEWER: Could you
describe Amanda?


590
0:24:57,48 --> 0:24:58,95
MATT FISHER: Amanda's
fantastic.


591
0:24:58,95 --> 0:25:1,29
She's a really hard-working
girl.


592
0:25:1,29 --> 0:25:2,79
She's very independent.


593
0:25:2,79 --> 0:25:4,7
She's gorgeous.


594
0:25:4,7 --> 0:25:7,425
She's got blonde hair,
big assets.


595
0:25:7,425 --> 0:25:14,2



596
0:25:14,2 --> 0:25:15,32
RICK VAUGHN: Bien.


597
0:25:15,32 --> 0:25:17,438
Senor Rick Vaughn, Amanda
Harrington.


598
0:25:17,438 --> 0:25:18,41
AMANDA HARRINGTON: Hello.


599
0:25:18,41 --> 0:25:19,382
Nice to meet you.


600
0:25:19,382 --> 0:25:20,354
MALE SPEAKER: Nice
to meet you.


601
0:25:20,354 --> 0:25:23,756
JADE: Oh, wait for me!


602
0:25:23,756 --> 0:25:25,6
Sorry.


603
0:25:25,6 --> 0:25:27,65



604
0:25:27,65 --> 0:25:29,1
JADE: I was thinking, in this
lift, long enough, you could


605
0:25:29,1 --> 0:25:32,521
do full make-up, couldn't you?


606
0:25:32,521 --> 0:25:33,97
Hi!


607
0:25:33,97 --> 0:25:35,87
Are you OK?


608
0:25:35,87 --> 0:25:37,9
Hi ya.


609
0:25:37,9 --> 0:25:38,495
AMANDA HARRINGTON: Are you OK?


610
0:25:38,495 --> 0:25:39,32
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah,
I'm fine, are you?


611
0:25:39,32 --> 0:25:40,328
AMANDA HARRINGTON: I'll be with
you now, I've just got to


612
0:25:40,328 --> 0:25:41,64
get these pictures taken.


613
0:25:41,64 --> 0:25:43,53
I know, but my fringe
is on this side.


614
0:25:43,53 --> 0:25:44,78
I need to be this side.


615
0:25:44,78 --> 0:25:47,458



616
0:25:47,458 --> 0:25:49,873
MALE SPEAKER: A headshot.


617
0:25:49,873 --> 0:25:51,63
Who's the lady in the red
dress, by the way?


618
0:25:51,63 --> 0:25:52,37
AMANDA HARRINGTON: My friend.


619
0:25:52,37 --> 0:25:53,4
MALE SPEAKER: Is that
your friend?


620
0:25:53,4 --> 0:25:54,19
Get her in the picture.


621
0:25:54,19 --> 0:25:55,2
AMANDA HARRINGTON: Jade,
do you want to get a


622
0:25:55,2 --> 0:25:55,75
picture with me?


623
0:25:55,75 --> 0:25:56,3
MALE SPEAKER: Get
by the window.


624
0:25:56,3 --> 0:25:56,73
Get by the window.


625
0:25:56,73 --> 0:25:58,64
Because it'll look
really great.


626
0:25:58,64 --> 0:26:1,43
RICK VAUGHN: You've actually met
a couple of girls who are


627
0:26:1,43 --> 0:26:3,6
what I call grafters.


628
0:26:3,6 --> 0:26:5,41
They're actually prepared to get
out there and not wait for


629
0:26:5,41 --> 0:26:8,0
somebody to rock up with a
cheque book and say, go and


630
0:26:8,0 --> 0:26:9,17
get what you want.


631
0:26:9,17 --> 0:26:10,89
They'll fight for every
penny they earn.


632
0:26:10,89 --> 0:26:11,93
It's the old saying, isn't it?


633
0:26:11,93 --> 0:26:13,52
You judge a book by the cover.


634
0:26:13,52 --> 0:26:14,62
A lot of people do that.


635
0:26:14,62 --> 0:26:16,15
Especially, with the
WAG culture,


636
0:26:16,15 --> 0:26:17,78
the Liverpool culture.


637
0:26:17,78 --> 0:26:19,74
And I dare say, there are a lot
of girls out there that


638
0:26:19,74 --> 0:26:22,54
would love to be hooked up
to a footballer or two.


639
0:26:22,54 --> 0:26:24,54
Wouldn't we all for
a nice life.


640
0:26:24,54 --> 0:26:27,6
However, when you actually
scratch the surface of some of


641
0:26:27,6 --> 0:26:30,8
the girls and realize about
their insecurities, their


642
0:26:30,8 --> 0:26:34,61
frailties, they're just
normal girls.


643
0:26:34,61 --> 0:26:37,47
Amanda and Jade are
real good friends.


644
0:26:37,47 --> 0:26:39,16
And everyone would think, well,
isn't there a bit of,


645
0:26:39,16 --> 0:26:42,29
sort of, animosity in there over
who gets what gig or who


646
0:26:42,29 --> 0:26:43,36
gets what magazine.


647
0:26:43,36 --> 0:26:46,1
They're from a different
era, where--


648
0:26:46,1 --> 0:26:46,96
I call them young kids.


649
0:26:46,96 --> 0:26:49,282
They're not young kids because
I'd like to say we're all the


650
0:26:49,282 --> 0:26:51,99
same age, 20 something--


651
0:26:51,99 --> 0:26:55,95
where, for them, history,
possibly, isn't a big part of


652
0:26:55,95 --> 0:26:57,6
their lives.


653
0:26:57,6 --> 0:26:58,6
It's all about the future.


654
0:26:58,6 --> 0:27:1,35
I think kids now would rather
know about how a Selfridges


655
0:27:1,35 --> 0:27:4,14
were built, rather than
how a castle is built.


656
0:27:4,14 --> 0:27:5,25
That's life.


657
0:27:5,25 --> 0:27:6,3
Get with the program.


658
0:27:6,3 --> 0:27:7,31
Let's move it on.


659
0:27:7,31 --> 0:27:11,12
Once you scratch the surface,
and all the hype around the


660
0:27:11,12 --> 0:27:13,3
girls, because they're
really popular and


661
0:27:13,3 --> 0:27:14,28
for the right reasons.


662
0:27:14,28 --> 0:27:16,91
They do lots of stuff for
charity, which nobody even


663
0:27:16,91 --> 0:27:20,26
ever talks about because you
wouldn't associate the girls


664
0:27:20,26 --> 0:27:21,88
with charity stuff.


665
0:27:21,88 --> 0:27:23,55
And they'll probably
not even mention


666
0:27:23,55 --> 0:27:24,8
it to you guys tonight.


667
0:27:24,8 --> 0:27:27,17
They're not like, they're
just normal girls,


668
0:27:27,17 --> 0:27:29,25
who, like us all--


669
0:27:29,25 --> 0:27:31,69
it sounds a bit corny--
just want to be loved.


670
0:27:31,69 --> 0:27:35,66



671
0:27:35,66 --> 0:27:38,225
AMANDA HARRINGTON: To be honest,
I've been in a couple


672
0:27:38,225 --> 0:27:42,18
relationships over the years.


673
0:27:42,18 --> 0:27:44,74
When I've been single, I find
it hard to meet someone


674
0:27:44,74 --> 0:27:49,96
because I don't get approached
a lot, at all, really, never.


675
0:27:49,96 --> 0:27:50,91
I mean, I'm not a big head.


676
0:27:50,91 --> 0:27:52,41
I wouldn't like to say it's
because of the way I look


677
0:27:52,41 --> 0:27:53,37
because I'm not like that.


678
0:27:53,37 --> 0:27:55,6
Well, maybe that's what it is.


679
0:27:55,6 --> 0:27:57,0
Maybe they are a bit
intimidated, I don't know.


680
0:27:57,0 --> 0:27:59,75
I wouldn't like to say, but
that's what my friends has


681
0:27:59,75 --> 0:28:1,923
said because sometimes I've
been single for ages.


682
0:28:1,923 --> 0:28:4,59
And I've thought, why is that?


683
0:28:4,59 --> 0:28:6,9
But obviously, maybe
it is intimidation.


684
0:28:6,9 --> 0:28:8,21
I'm not sure.


685
0:28:8,21 --> 0:28:10,25
My mum brought me up on my own
and didn't really have my dad


686
0:28:10,25 --> 0:28:11,12
around much.


687
0:28:11,12 --> 0:28:15,76
So I think that's what made me
more determined in what I do.


688
0:28:15,76 --> 0:28:17,89
This is my mum.


689
0:28:17,89 --> 0:28:19,943
FEMALE SPEAKER: Always
looked after herself.


690
0:28:19,943 --> 0:28:22,248
Always wanted the best
of everything.


691
0:28:22,248 --> 0:28:24,3
INTERVIEWER: Did she
get that from you?


692
0:28:24,3 --> 0:28:25,855
AMANDA HARRINGTON: No, to
be honest, my mum's


693
0:28:25,855 --> 0:28:27,17
twin sister it is.


694
0:28:27,17 --> 0:28:27,98
Yeah, my twin sister.


695
0:28:27,98 --> 0:28:30,685
My mum's twin is more like me.


696
0:28:30,685 --> 0:28:33,16
My mum is not really
that fussed on.


697
0:28:33,16 --> 0:28:36,13
You like nice clothes and stuff,
but she's not obsessed


698
0:28:36,13 --> 0:28:36,63
with shopping or whatever.


699
0:28:36,63 --> 0:28:37,96
Where, my mum's twin is.


700
0:28:37,96 --> 0:28:40,287
I think I'm more like my mum's
twin than I am my mum.


701
0:28:40,287 --> 0:28:41,943
FEMALE SPEAKER: I think some
of them should cool down a


702
0:28:41,943 --> 0:28:44,511
little bit with the make-up
because most of them are


703
0:28:44,511 --> 0:28:46,251
natural beauties, anyway,
aren't they?


704
0:28:46,251 --> 0:28:46,75
They really are.


705
0:28:46,75 --> 0:28:48,53
But I don't think she
needs all that.


706
0:28:48,53 --> 0:28:53,62



707
0:28:53,62 --> 0:28:55,157
FEMALE SPEAKER: Well, what's
the point of having a


708
0:28:55,157 --> 0:28:57,42
personality if you
look terrible?


709
0:28:57,42 --> 0:29:0,4
The whole world is based
on appearances, first


710
0:29:0,4 --> 0:29:1,47
impressions.


711
0:29:1,47 --> 0:29:3,1
That's not the be all and
end all of everything,


712
0:29:3,1 --> 0:29:4,2
don't get me wrong.


713
0:29:4,2 --> 0:29:6,81
But it's first impressions that
people have got of people


714
0:29:6,81 --> 0:29:7,93
that matter.


715
0:29:7,93 --> 0:29:10,38
I don't expect all of them
people to like the way I look.


716
0:29:10,38 --> 0:29:12,92
But I just don't want to
look the same as them.


717
0:29:12,92 --> 0:29:15,78
I look after my appearance in
my own way, not in the way


718
0:29:15,78 --> 0:29:17,3
that they look after theirs.


719
0:29:17,3 --> 0:29:35,8



720
0:29:35,8 --> 0:29:36,71
This is Mark Hart.


721
0:29:36,71 --> 0:29:39,62
He's a junior competitor, one
of our lads from the gym.


722
0:29:39,62 --> 0:29:40,99
He's here today to compete.


723
0:29:40,99 --> 0:29:42,18
Obviously, he'll have tan on.


724
0:29:42,18 --> 0:29:44,475
MARK HART: I'll have
tan on, yeah.


725
0:29:44,475 --> 0:29:45,87
INTERVIEWER: What sort of
tan will you put on?


726
0:29:45,87 --> 0:29:46,32
MARK HART: Dream Tan.


727
0:29:46,32 --> 0:29:47,36
We used the Dream Tan.


728
0:29:47,36 --> 0:29:48,66
Last time we used Pro Tan.


729
0:29:48,66 --> 0:29:49,76
INTERVIEWER: And explain
what that is.


730
0:29:49,76 --> 0:29:51,76
MARK HART: Dream Tan is like
dead thick color, so when you


731
0:29:51,76 --> 0:29:53,61
put it on it will be
like straight on.


732
0:29:53,61 --> 0:29:55,78
Not like you've got to develop
the other tan that you've got


733
0:29:55,78 --> 0:29:57,57
to put on coats and coats.


734
0:29:57,57 --> 0:29:59,713
MALE SPEAKER: It reminds me
of the Fantastic Four or


735
0:29:59,713 --> 0:30:0,83
something like that.


736
0:30:0,83 --> 0:30:1,94
COLIN MATHIESON: Well,
I've never tried it


737
0:30:1,94 --> 0:30:2,82
with a roller before.


738
0:30:2,82 --> 0:30:5,58
Normally, we just put it on you
with a sponge, put on with


739
0:30:5,58 --> 0:30:6,77
your fingers.


740
0:30:6,77 --> 0:30:11,3
Or you could just dab it on,
just rub it in with the hands.


741
0:30:11,3 --> 0:30:14,56
So I was just trying with the
sponge just to see what the


742
0:30:14,56 --> 0:30:15,42
difference was like.


743
0:30:15,42 --> 0:30:16,56
MALE SPEAKER: Just slap
it on like mud.


744
0:30:16,56 --> 0:30:17,96
It's a bit thin, that.


745
0:30:17,96 --> 0:30:19,36
COLIN MATHIESON: A friend of
mine had suggested did


746
0:30:19,36 --> 0:30:20,74
I want to try it.


747
0:30:20,74 --> 0:30:23,42
I had tried jiu-jitsu,
I'd tried karate.


748
0:30:23,42 --> 0:30:26,15
And bodybuilding I
just got to like.


749
0:30:26,15 --> 0:30:28,41
You don't do it for females.


750
0:30:28,41 --> 0:30:31,1
A lot of females
don't like it.


751
0:30:31,1 --> 0:30:33,8
You'll notice it will
be more like a lad


752
0:30:33,8 --> 0:30:35,46
would notice your physique.


753
0:30:35,46 --> 0:30:37,9
Everyone was saying to me last
night, oh, where have you


754
0:30:37,9 --> 0:30:37,985
been, where have
you been, where


755
0:30:37,985 --> 0:30:39,66
have you been on holiday?


756
0:30:39,66 --> 0:30:41,36
I went, no, I haven't.


757
0:30:41,36 --> 0:30:43,11
It gives you more confidence.


758
0:30:43,11 --> 0:30:44,57
It does give you more
confidence.


759
0:30:44,57 --> 0:30:50,57
And for people who are suffering
a lack of confidence


760
0:30:50,57 --> 0:30:51,6
it would be a good thing.


761
0:30:51,6 --> 0:30:52,79
This comes off on
your clothes.


762
0:30:52,79 --> 0:30:54,25
I comes off in your bed.


763
0:30:54,25 --> 0:30:57,17
When you get the tan you
sleep on old sheets.


764
0:30:57,17 --> 0:30:58,72
You wear tracksuits in bed.


765
0:30:58,72 --> 0:30:59,57
It's uncomfortable.


766
0:30:59,57 --> 0:31:0,75
It's sticky.


767
0:31:0,75 --> 0:31:2,39
It's tacky.


768
0:31:2,39 --> 0:31:3,67
But it looks nice.


769
0:31:3,67 --> 0:31:6,1
If was girls who always used the
sunbed shops and all that.


770
0:31:6,1 --> 0:31:8,58
But now there's a lot of lads
who use sunbed shops.


771
0:31:8,58 --> 0:31:11,4
I know it's not a healthy thing
and it's not a good


772
0:31:11,4 --> 0:31:14,64
thing for underage or--


773
0:31:14,64 --> 0:31:17,96
I can understand them putting an
age limit on using sunbeds


774
0:31:17,96 --> 0:31:19,79
and sun showers.


775
0:31:19,79 --> 0:31:23,22
But for other people, it's
a business, isn't it?


776
0:31:23,22 --> 0:31:24,19
You can get injections.


777
0:31:24,19 --> 0:31:26,61
Melanotan is what it is.


778
0:31:26,61 --> 0:31:28,41
But there's reports on that.


779
0:31:28,41 --> 0:31:30,43
I've got reports in the
gym on the wall.


780
0:31:30,43 --> 0:31:33,65
I had a newspaper cutting saying
it's a link to cancer.


781
0:31:33,65 --> 0:31:37,79
Now, whether it is a link
to cancer, I don't know.


782
0:31:37,79 --> 0:31:40,99
It's supposed to help your
sexual life, as well,


783
0:31:40,99 --> 0:31:42,24
apparently.


784
0:31:42,24 --> 0:31:43,81



785
0:31:43,81 --> 0:31:45,6
Nearly lost my finger then.


786
0:31:45,6 --> 0:31:49,97



787
0:31:49,97 --> 0:31:52,13
MALE SPEAKER: Liverpool has, I
have to say, and I've heard a


788
0:31:52,13 --> 0:31:54,73
lot people say this, probably
the best looking girls in the


789
0:31:54,73 --> 0:31:57,175
country, or not far off.


790
0:31:57,175 --> 0:31:58,56
If you travel around the
country, and I travel around


791
0:31:58,56 --> 0:32:0,996
the country quite a lot,
Liverpool does have some of


792
0:32:0,996 --> 0:32:2,83
the best looking
girls, I think.


793
0:32:2,83 --> 0:32:5,9
And they always make an effort
when they go out, probably a


794
0:32:5,9 --> 0:32:6,29
lot more than other places.


795
0:32:6,29 --> 0:32:8,35
It's very fashion conscious.


796
0:32:8,35 --> 0:32:9,839
And so I think that
is probably one


797
0:32:9,839 --> 0:32:11,89
major, major thing.


798
0:32:11,89 --> 0:32:18,344



799
0:32:18,344 --> 0:32:20,31
INTERVIEWER: How many
floors up is it?


800
0:32:20,31 --> 0:32:21,3
JADE: Four.


801
0:32:21,3 --> 0:32:21,49
Three.


802
0:32:21,49 --> 0:32:22,59
Well, we're on one
so we're going to


803
0:32:22,59 --> 0:32:24,704
four, so is that three?


804
0:32:24,704 --> 0:32:25,954
Four.


805
0:32:25,954 --> 0:32:32,159



806
0:32:32,159 --> 0:32:33,17
MALE SPEAKER: They're
not celebrities.


807
0:32:33,17 --> 0:32:35,16
Nobody knows them.


808
0:32:35,16 --> 0:32:36,9
JADE: This is Palm Sugar.


809
0:32:36,9 --> 0:32:40,32
It's the new It place
to be in Liverpool.


810
0:32:40,32 --> 0:32:42,42
We just think to do the most
amazing cocktails.


811
0:32:42,42 --> 0:32:43,73
They do gorgeous shots.


812
0:32:43,73 --> 0:32:46,38
And I just think it's just a
fantastic place for everyone


813
0:32:46,38 --> 0:32:47,976
to meet up on a night out.


814
0:32:47,976 --> 0:32:49,72
MALE SPEAKER: It's very nice.


815
0:32:49,72 --> 0:32:51,37
MALE SPEAKER: If you call me
on a Friday or a Saturday


816
0:32:51,37 --> 0:32:54,43
night, any weekend, really,
we tend to have--


817
0:32:54,43 --> 0:32:56,61
everyone looks like Jade,
well, tries to


818
0:32:56,61 --> 0:32:59,32
look as good as Jade.


819
0:32:59,32 --> 0:33:1,65
Certainly, Liverpool
women take pride--


820
0:33:1,65 --> 0:33:2,71
JADE: How to make the
best of themselves.


821
0:33:2,71 --> 0:33:3,98
MALE SPEAKER: --looking
after themselves.


822
0:33:3,98 --> 0:33:6,29
It's like almost a competition,
isn't it?


823
0:33:6,29 --> 0:33:7,88
Have you actually danced
on the bar yet?


824
0:33:7,88 --> 0:33:9,311
JADE: No, I've had my
photo taken on there


825
0:33:9,311 --> 0:33:9,913
though, didn't I?


826
0:33:9,913 --> 0:33:12,62
MALE SPEAKER: In the center.


827
0:33:12,62 --> 0:33:16,53
Very opulent, luxurious, very
Liverpool, lots of Swarovski


828
0:33:16,53 --> 0:33:20,62
everywhere you look, three and a
half million pounds worth in


829
0:33:20,62 --> 0:33:21,74
the whole place.


830
0:33:21,74 --> 0:33:23,19
JADE: I just think the lights
look absolutely


831
0:33:23,19 --> 0:33:24,53
amazing, don't they?


832
0:33:24,53 --> 0:33:25,99
MALE SPEAKER: You've got
actually crystals on your


833
0:33:25,99 --> 0:33:26,972
business cards?


834
0:33:26,972 --> 0:33:29,703
JADE: No, my photograph in here
is on my business cards.


835
0:33:29,703 --> 0:33:32,413
And everyone says to me every
time I that I get them out, oh


836
0:33:32,413 --> 0:33:34,51
my god, how amazing
are those lights.


837
0:33:34,51 --> 0:33:37,35
MALE SPEAKER: Very sparkly,
very Liverpool.


838
0:33:37,35 --> 0:33:41,43
This is a traditional
gong from Thailand.


839
0:33:41,43 --> 0:33:44,79
It was meal time for monks,
actually it could be heard


840
0:33:44,79 --> 0:33:46,872
from miles away.


841
0:33:46,872 --> 0:33:48,61
JADE: Like that?


842
0:33:48,61 --> 0:33:50,54
MALE SPEAKER: This is where most
of our celebrities come,


843
0:33:50,54 --> 0:33:51,15
isn't it Jade?


844
0:33:51,15 --> 0:33:52,22
JADE: Yes, it is.


845
0:33:52,22 --> 0:33:54,17
MALE SPEAKER: All the
footballers, the WAGS.


846
0:33:54,17 --> 0:33:57,64
This is definitely your
high-end Gucci.


847
0:33:57,64 --> 0:33:59,99
And downstairs is
more Topshop.


848
0:33:59,99 --> 0:34:2,93



849
0:34:2,93 --> 0:34:4,35
I don't think anybody
in Liverpool


850
0:34:4,35 --> 0:34:6,35
takes themselves seriously.


851
0:34:6,35 --> 0:34:8,25
We're all comedians,
aren't we?


852
0:34:8,25 --> 0:34:9,94
I think we're all a bit real.


853
0:34:9,94 --> 0:34:13,79
I think we know where we're
from and what we do.


854
0:34:13,79 --> 0:34:17,34
And I suppose I'm speaking for
you here, on your behalf, you


855
0:34:17,34 --> 0:34:19,61
make a lot of effort, in terms
of your appearance, and spend


856
0:34:19,61 --> 0:34:21,909
an awful lot of money
on your appearance.


857
0:34:21,909 --> 0:34:22,92
But you don't take
yourself serious.


858
0:34:22,92 --> 0:34:24,83
You're still a real,
down-to-earth girl.


859
0:34:24,83 --> 0:34:26,9
JADE: Oh god, yeah.


860
0:34:26,9 --> 0:34:28,23
MALE SPEAKER: And through here
is the most popular for the


861
0:34:28,23 --> 0:34:29,48
curry and chips.


862
0:34:29,48 --> 0:34:33,0



863
0:34:33,0 --> 0:34:34,53
This is typical of Liverpool.


864
0:34:34,53 --> 0:34:36,969
This is where all the gossip--


865
0:34:36,969 --> 0:34:38,29
this is where you find
out everything.


866
0:34:38,29 --> 0:34:41,72
Anything you want to share with
us that's happened here?


867
0:34:41,72 --> 0:34:42,97
Any gossip?


868
0:34:42,97 --> 0:34:46,63



869
0:34:46,63 --> 0:34:50,3
The inspiration behind this
was all Romeo and Juliet.


870
0:34:50,3 --> 0:34:53,62
Obviously, where the two first
met, and it was romance.


871
0:34:53,62 --> 0:34:56,7
Obviously, the Liverpool spin
on that, with the characters


872
0:34:56,7 --> 0:35:0,9
and the humor would be, they
first met in the toilet.


873
0:35:0,9 --> 0:35:3,86



874
0:35:3,86 --> 0:35:5,0
Wasn't that loud, was it?


875
0:35:5,0 --> 0:35:8,5
You know, I was born and
bred in Liverpool.


876
0:35:8,5 --> 0:35:10,68
And the I went to the
States to live.


877
0:35:10,68 --> 0:35:12,68
And came back, and it was
completely different.


878
0:35:12,68 --> 0:35:15,48
Because when I left, it was like
shell suits, curly hair


879
0:35:15,48 --> 0:35:16,58
and moustaches.


880
0:35:16,58 --> 0:35:19,15
And then came back to a
little bit of style.


881
0:35:19,15 --> 0:35:20,43
And I just think it's
just evolved.


882
0:35:20,43 --> 0:35:24,14
I think in ten years' time,
we'll give anywhere a run for


883
0:35:24,14 --> 0:35:25,39
their money.


884
0:35:25,39 --> 0:35:28,7



885
0:35:28,7 --> 0:35:28,61
AMANDA MOSS: The Philly
cheesesteak


886
0:35:28,61 --> 0:35:30,9
sandwich looks nice.


887
0:35:30,9 --> 0:35:34,25
But then I've seen half
roast chicken.


888
0:35:34,25 --> 0:35:34,936
Steak.


889
0:35:34,936 --> 0:35:37,5
JADE: A Reform burger.


890
0:35:37,5 --> 0:35:40,6
AMANDA MOSS: Chocolate fudge
cake, followed by steak.


891
0:35:40,6 --> 0:35:45,27
Chicken liver pate followed
by steak.


892
0:35:45,27 --> 0:35:47,64
Oh, the burger sounds--


893
0:35:47,64 --> 0:35:48,28
Burger.


894
0:35:48,28 --> 0:35:50,57
MALE SPEAKER: Are you
ready to order?


895
0:35:50,57 --> 0:35:51,97
AMANDA MOSS: I was going to
have a the char-grilled


896
0:35:51,97 --> 0:35:55,4
asparagus and then steak.


897
0:35:55,4 --> 0:35:58,1
It's got to be cooked and juicy,
but cooked all the


898
0:35:58,1 --> 0:36:1,26
through to the middle,
but not rubbery.


899
0:36:1,26 --> 0:36:2,67
I don't want to see blood.


900
0:36:2,67 --> 0:36:4,73
I might have to send it
back if it's blood.


901
0:36:4,73 --> 0:36:8,2
JADE: Can I have the duck spring
rolls please, and the


902
0:36:8,2 --> 0:36:9,51
duck breast.


903
0:36:9,51 --> 0:36:10,14
AMANDA MOSS: That's it.


904
0:36:10,14 --> 0:36:11,67
One more drink, and then
I'm on Diet Cokes


905
0:36:11,67 --> 0:36:12,92
for a couple of hours.


906
0:36:12,92 --> 0:36:15,76



907
0:36:15,76 --> 0:36:19,4
I'm Amanda Moss, editor of
Lifestyle Monthly magazine,


908
0:36:19,4 --> 0:36:23,1
which is the biggest lifestyle
magazine for Liverpool, the


909
0:36:23,1 --> 0:36:24,82
Wirral, and Southport.


910
0:36:24,82 --> 0:36:28,48
Jade approached me and said,
why don't I do a fashion


911
0:36:28,48 --> 0:36:30,6
column for you.


912
0:36:30,6 --> 0:36:31,7
We've got loads of events
planned now.


913
0:36:31,7 --> 0:36:35,12
And we're gonna just work
together loads, aren't we?


914
0:36:35,12 --> 0:36:40,93
I'm having a cocktail party at
my house just for select VIPs.


915
0:36:40,93 --> 0:36:45,46
We're doing champagne, cupcakes,
and jewelry.


916
0:36:45,46 --> 0:36:50,42



917
0:36:50,42 --> 0:36:53,595
This is where I sit when the
kids are asleep and listen to


918
0:36:53,595 --> 0:36:56,2
them all synchronized snoring.


919
0:36:56,2 --> 0:36:59,4
This is my little
chill out zone.


920
0:36:59,4 --> 0:36:59,66
Lost my drink.


921
0:36:59,66 --> 0:37:1,5
Don't know where my
drink's gone.


922
0:37:1,5 --> 0:37:2,45
Well, that's Saxon's room.


923
0:37:2,45 --> 0:37:4,62
Saxon and Honey tend
to sleep together.


924
0:37:4,62 --> 0:37:5,86
Well, Floyd and Albany--


925
0:37:5,86 --> 0:37:9,87
although Albany's with me.


926
0:37:9,87 --> 0:37:11,63
FEMALE SPEAKER: Albany's
the baby?


927
0:37:11,63 --> 0:37:12,88
AMANDA MOSS: No, Darling's
the baby.


928
0:37:12,88 --> 0:37:15,768



929
0:37:15,768 --> 0:37:17,72
Saxon!


930
0:37:17,72 --> 0:37:20,31
Keep the noise down!


931
0:37:20,31 --> 0:37:21,54
Why should London
be the capital


932
0:37:21,54 --> 0:37:23,83
of couture and fashion?


933
0:37:23,83 --> 0:37:26,0
Liverpool has got
everything here.


934
0:37:26,0 --> 0:37:29,13
You get to meet lots of people
and go to glamorous parties


935
0:37:29,13 --> 0:37:30,5
like this one.


936
0:37:30,5 --> 0:37:34,43
Will you go downstairs
and be quiet!


937
0:37:34,43 --> 0:37:36,86
I mean I'm not even from
Liverpool, and yet I've


938
0:37:36,86 --> 0:37:41,53
established myself as Amanda
Moss, editor of Lifestyle


939
0:37:41,53 --> 0:37:42,18
Monthly magazine.


940
0:37:42,18 --> 0:37:44,43
I walk into town and
everybody knows me.


941
0:37:44,43 --> 0:37:46,17
We've got more fans on Facebook
than anyone else.


942
0:37:46,17 --> 0:37:47,15
INTERVIEWER: How many
have you got?


943
0:37:47,15 --> 0:37:48,78
AMANDA MOSS: 1,400.


944
0:37:48,78 --> 0:37:53,7
I just want everybody to just
know Lifestyle Monthly is just


945
0:37:53,7 --> 0:37:55,918
the best thing since sliced
bread, really.


946
0:37:55,918 --> 0:38:21,87
[MUSIC]


947
0:38:21,87 --> 0:38:26,55
FEMALE SPEAKER: Liverpool
fashion, it's big hair, curls,


948
0:38:26,55 --> 0:38:32,21
jewels and glitter and massive
heels, massive platforms.


949
0:38:32,21 --> 0:38:35,703
I was gonna say, if you're not
in heels in Liverpool, see ya!


950
0:38:35,703 --> 0:38:37,2
FEMALE SPEAKER: Little
heels, you're getting


951
0:38:37,2 --> 0:38:38,697
chucked in the gutter.


952
0:38:38,697 --> 0:38:39,695
FEMALE SPEAKER: Little heels
and you're out of here.


953
0:38:39,695 --> 0:38:41,358
FEMALE SPEAKER: Kitten heels
make me want to kill myself a


954
0:38:41,358 --> 0:38:42,689
little bit.


955
0:38:42,689 --> 0:38:44,934
FEMALE SPEAKER: The whole money
that we earn from our


956
0:38:44,934 --> 0:38:47,679
shitty jobs, we're going to
have amazing outfits for.


957
0:38:47,679 --> 0:38:48,677
It's a babe.


958
0:38:48,677 --> 0:38:50,174
It's a sexy little babe.


959
0:38:50,174 --> 0:38:52,17
We love it so bad it hurts.


960
0:38:52,17 --> 0:38:53,667
Liverpool is a babe.


961

[MUSIC]


962
0:39:17,12 --> 0:39:24,62



963
0:39:24,62 --> 0:39:26,96
SERENA STREGAPEDE: This is
my dress for tomorrow.


964
0:39:26,96 --> 0:39:28,51
A guy called Ronnie made this.


965
0:39:28,51 --> 0:39:30,18
I've had him up the
wall with it.


966
0:39:30,18 --> 0:39:31,71
But it looks better
on, anyway.


967
0:39:31,71 --> 0:39:36,38
It's just a nice, long fitted
dress, fishtail, as well.


968
0:39:36,38 --> 0:39:38,33
Well, we have to do
a swimwear one.


969
0:39:38,33 --> 0:39:40,76
And then after that, we do
the evening wear one.


970
0:39:40,76 --> 0:39:42,846
These are one pair of shoes
I'm going to be wearing.


971
0:39:42,846 --> 0:39:46,15



972
0:39:46,15 --> 0:39:46,85
Nice, aren't they?


973
0:39:46,85 --> 0:39:48,97
And we've got our pink
stools, as well.


974
0:39:48,97 --> 0:39:51,82



975
0:39:51,82 --> 0:39:56,7
And there's Tony when he boxed
some Russian or something.


976
0:39:56,7 --> 0:39:57,75
And that's just some of
his belts, as well.


977
0:39:57,75 --> 0:40:0,67
We're just waiting to get them
framed and all that and then


978
0:40:0,67 --> 0:40:1,81
put up on the wall.


979
0:40:1,81 --> 0:40:3,82
INTERVIEWER: How'd
you two meet?


980
0:40:3,82 --> 0:40:4,77
SERENA STREGAPEDE:
In our shop.


981
0:40:4,77 --> 0:40:6,6
In my work.


982
0:40:6,6 --> 0:40:7,49
INTERVIEWER: What
work is that?


983
0:40:7,49 --> 0:40:8,7
SERENA STREGAPEDE:
I do beauty.


984
0:40:8,7 --> 0:40:9,76
INTERVIEWER: You've got
your own beauty place?


985
0:40:9,76 --> 0:40:11,464
SERENA STREGAPEDE: I do beauty
and that as well.


986
0:40:11,464 --> 0:40:12,7
INTERVIEWER: Do you go in there
for beauty treatments?


987
0:40:12,7 --> 0:40:14,6
TONY: For some reason, I grow
more hair on my back and my


988
0:40:14,6 --> 0:40:16,55
chest than I do on my head.


989
0:40:16,55 --> 0:40:18,72
She gets me in there, and says,
it'll be all right, it


990
0:40:18,72 --> 0:40:19,63
doesn't hurt.


991
0:40:19,63 --> 0:40:22,25
So one step, bang!


992
0:40:22,25 --> 0:40:22,69
Never again.


993
0:40:22,69 --> 0:40:24,2
I'd rather go home and
just shave it off.


994
0:40:24,2 --> 0:40:25,31
INTERVIEWER: Was it love
at first sight?


995
0:40:25,31 --> 0:40:27,57
SERENA STREGAPEDE:
Yeah, definitely.


996
0:40:27,57 --> 0:40:29,156
Definitely, wasn't it?


997
0:40:29,156 --> 0:40:32,54
TONY: Yeah, she's lucky
to have me.


998
0:40:32,54 --> 0:40:34,4
INTERVIEWER: What do you think
the outcome of the


999
0:40:34,4 --> 0:40:36,63
competition's going to be?


1000
0:40:36,63 --> 0:40:38,94
SERENA STREGAPEDE: Well,
I'd like to win.


1001
0:40:38,94 --> 0:40:40,25
INTERVIEWER: Are you
hopeful or what?


1002
0:40:40,25 --> 0:40:41,14
SERENA STREGAPEDE: Yeah, very.


1003
0:40:41,14 --> 0:40:41,95
I'm positive.


1004
0:40:41,95 --> 0:40:43,245
I'm so positive.


1005
0:40:43,245 --> 0:40:45,15
INTERVIEWER: Do you know
any of the judges?


1006
0:40:45,15 --> 0:40:45,93
SERENA STREGAPEDE: No.


1007
0:40:45,93 --> 0:40:48,3
INTERVIEWER: This guy we were
with knew three judges.


1008
0:40:48,3 --> 0:40:51,48
SERENA STREGAPEDE: Well, Tony
boxed one of the judges, but I


1009
0:40:51,48 --> 0:40:53,2
don't really know him.


1010
0:40:53,2 --> 0:40:56,84
Because Liverpool is such a
glamorous city, everyone wants


1011
0:40:56,84 --> 0:40:58,135
a beauty therapist.


1012
0:40:58,135 --> 0:40:59,26
INTERVIEWER: Cause
some fellows get


1013
0:40:59,26 --> 0:41:0,86
spray tans, don't they?


1014
0:41:0,86 --> 0:41:1,1
SERENA STREGAPEDE: Yeah,
they do, yeah.


1015
0:41:1,1 --> 0:41:4,41
TONY: I know some fighters, like
Dave Coldwell, who waxes


1016
0:41:4,41 --> 0:41:5,22
his eyebrows.


1017
0:41:5,22 --> 0:41:8,29
And he's taken a little bit of a
pasting off me, from time to


1018
0:41:8,29 --> 0:41:10,68
time with getting them done.


1019
0:41:10,68 --> 0:41:12,52
It's good that he wants to look
after himself, but come


1020
0:41:12,52 --> 0:41:13,52
on, you don't need to
wax your eyebrows.


1021
0:41:13,52 --> 0:41:15,66
SERENA STREGAPEDE: Well, Tony,
a few years ago came into my


1022
0:41:15,66 --> 0:41:16,95
shop to see me.


1023
0:41:16,95 --> 0:41:18,44
And we were bored because
it was a quiet day.


1024
0:41:18,44 --> 0:41:20,26
So I said to him, oh what
can I do, I want to do


1025
0:41:20,26 --> 0:41:21,47
something, I'm bored.


1026
0:41:21,47 --> 0:41:22,577
Pierce my ear then.


1027
0:41:22,577 --> 0:41:24,9
I went, all right, then.


1028
0:41:24,9 --> 0:41:25,39
And I pierced his ear and he was
walking around with this


1029
0:41:25,39 --> 0:41:27,89
diamond earring in.


1030
0:41:27,89 --> 0:41:29,98
TONY: It seemed good
at the time.


1031
0:41:29,98 --> 0:41:30,99
SERENA STREGAPEDE: Liverpool
lads aren't


1032
0:41:30,99 --> 0:41:32,9
like that, are they.


1033
0:41:32,9 --> 0:41:34,28
I know in London and places
like that they do, but in


1034
0:41:34,28 --> 0:41:37,215
Liverpool lads don't
really do that.


1035
0:41:37,215 --> 0:41:38,919
INTERVIEWER: One thing the lads
do in the city, there's


1036
0:41:38,919 --> 0:41:41,55
quite a bit of steroids
going on, isn't there?


1037
0:41:41,55 --> 0:41:42,88
TONY: You know, if you stood
around, if you go anywhere,


1038
0:41:42,88 --> 0:41:45,79
you see juice heads
everywhere.


1039
0:41:45,79 --> 0:41:47,88
INTERVIEWER: Is that
big in Liverpool?


1040
0:41:47,88 --> 0:41:50,89
TONY: Certain people, doormen,
mainly doormen


1041
0:41:50,89 --> 0:41:51,56
do stuff like that.


1042
0:41:51,56 --> 0:41:52,46
I don't know.


1043
0:41:52,46 --> 0:41:54,37
Each to their own.


1044
0:41:54,37 --> 0:41:56,47
I'm not going to sit here
and say, don't do it.


1045
0:41:56,47 --> 0:41:58,25
If they want to do it, it's a
free world and they can do


1046
0:41:58,25 --> 0:41:59,5
what they want.


1047
0:41:59,5 --> 0:42:2,538



1048
0:42:2,538 --> 0:42:5,795
FEMALE SPEAKER: I think what
Marcel's achieved in the last


1049
0:42:5,795 --> 0:42:7,68
year is amazing because
he's natural now.


1050
0:42:7,68 --> 0:42:10,46
But I just know that
by the time he's--


1051
0:42:10,46 --> 0:42:13,88
I think up until 21, he'll train
and achieve the best he


1052
0:42:13,88 --> 0:42:14,94
possibly can.


1053
0:42:14,94 --> 0:42:20,425
But once he gets to 21, I know
because then he'll be in the


1054
0:42:20,425 --> 0:42:21,59
Mister classes.


1055
0:42:21,59 --> 0:42:22,83
And I know what it entails.


1056
0:42:22,83 --> 0:42:23,78
INTERVIEWER: What's that?


1057
0:42:23,78 --> 0:42:25,88
FEMALE SPEAKER: The Misters,
it's like up until 21 you're


1058
0:42:25,88 --> 0:42:26,86
like a junior.


1059
0:42:26,86 --> 0:42:29,34
But then, when you get past
21, you have to go in the


1060
0:42:29,34 --> 0:42:33,19
Misters, which is kind of like
the big men, if you like.


1061
0:42:33,19 --> 0:42:36,68
And to get like that, I know
he's never going to --


1062
0:42:36,68 --> 0:42:38,436
he won't stay natural because he
can't, because it'd just be


1063
0:42:38,436 --> 0:42:39,686
a waste of time.


1064
0:42:39,686 --> 0:42:45,11



1065
0:42:45,11 --> 0:42:49,0
It's an awkward subject because
they have natural


1066
0:42:49,0 --> 0:42:52,205
organizations, right, where
people just go and compete and


1067
0:42:52,205 --> 0:42:53,44
they are natural.


1068
0:42:53,44 --> 0:42:56,4
Everybody knows that with
bodybuilding, most of them


1069
0:42:56,4 --> 0:42:57,24
aren't natural.


1070
0:42:57,24 --> 0:42:59,99
But the thing is, they're
not drug tested.


1071
0:42:59,99 --> 0:43:1,762
It's kind of, like,
acceptable, if


1072
0:43:1,762 --> 0:43:3,63
you know what I mean.


1073
0:43:3,63 --> 0:43:6,6
INTERVIEWER: Why should
it be unacceptable?


1074
0:43:6,6 --> 0:43:6,62
FEMALE SPEAKER: Why
should it be?


1075
0:43:6,62 --> 0:43:8,81
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.


1076
0:43:8,81 --> 0:43:11,75
People talk about it like
it's a bad thing, but


1077
0:43:11,75 --> 0:43:12,438
why is it a bad thing?


1078
0:43:12,438 --> 0:43:14,15
FEMALE SPEAKER: The thing is,
within the sport, everybody


1079
0:43:14,15 --> 0:43:18,95
knows who is and who isn't.


1080
0:43:18,95 --> 0:43:24,46
In the organizations that I know
they do drug test them.


1081
0:43:24,46 --> 0:43:27,392
You only have to look at a
certain physique and I can


1082
0:43:27,392 --> 0:43:30,418
tell which is natural
and which isn't.


1083
0:43:30,418 --> 0:43:33,9
And so can everybody
else who's into it.


1084
0:43:33,9 --> 0:43:34,34
Do you know what I mean?


1085
0:43:34,34 --> 0:43:36,874



1086
0:43:36,874 --> 0:43:39,81
INTERVIEWER: It's better
to be natural, right?


1087
0:43:39,81 --> 0:43:40,8
FEMALE SPEAKER: The thing
is, right, it


1088
0:43:40,8 --> 0:43:43,14
depends what you want.


1089
0:43:43,14 --> 0:43:44,94
If you want to look
freaky, you're


1090
0:43:44,94 --> 0:43:47,344
never going to be natural.


1091
0:43:47,344 --> 0:43:49,84
INTERVIEWER: Why do you think
people want to look freaky?


1092
0:43:49,84 --> 0:43:50,81
FEMALE SPEAKER: Because it's
like the biggest and


1093
0:43:50,81 --> 0:43:52,125
the best, isn't it?


1094
0:43:52,125 --> 0:43:54,448
What with the best condition,
the best everything.


1095
0:43:54,448 --> 0:43:57,8



1096
0:43:57,8 --> 0:43:58,55
Anouska?


1097
0:43:58,55 --> 0:43:59,18
ANOUSKA: Yeah?


1098
0:43:59,18 --> 0:44:0,89
FEMALE SPEAKER: Come
here please.


1099
0:44:0,89 --> 0:44:1,358
ANOUSKA: No.


1100
0:44:1,358 --> 0:44:2,8
FEMALE SPEAKER: OK, it
doesn't matter then,


1101
0:44:2,8 --> 0:44:3,906
I'll close the door.


1102
0:44:3,906 --> 0:44:4,9
INTERVIEWER: Is she shy?


1103
0:44:4,9 --> 0:44:6,37
FEMALE SPEAKER: Not
at all, no.


1104
0:44:6,37 --> 0:44:7,62
Show them your six pack then.


1105
0:44:7,62 --> 0:44:11,18



1106
0:44:11,18 --> 0:44:13,16
INTERVIEWER: How does
that happen?


1107
0:44:13,16 --> 0:44:14,16
FEMALE SPEAKER: She's
just a genetically


1108
0:44:14,16 --> 0:44:15,31
muscular, aren't you?


1109
0:44:15,31 --> 0:44:18,64
But she was training
28 hours a week.


1110
0:44:18,64 --> 0:44:21,35
Fridays, she used to do
one to eight, all day


1111
0:44:21,35 --> 0:44:22,58
Saturday and then--


1112
0:44:22,58 --> 0:44:23,65
INTERVIEWER: One to eight?


1113
0:44:23,65 --> 0:44:24,98
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah,
training.


1114
0:44:24,98 --> 0:44:26,11
INTERVIEWER: As in eight
hours a day?


1115
0:44:26,11 --> 0:44:26,995
FEMALE SPEAKER: Seven
hours, yeah.


1116
0:44:26,995 --> 0:44:29,33
INTERVIEWER: Well, what do you
do for seven hours a day?


1117
0:44:29,33 --> 0:44:30,79
FEMALE SPEAKER: What do you
do for seven hours a day?


1118
0:44:30,79 --> 0:44:31,745
INTERVIEWER: Training?


1119
0:44:31,745 --> 0:44:32,32
ANOUSKA: Yeah.


1120
0:44:32,32 --> 0:44:33,16
FEMALE SPEAKER: What
did you do?


1121
0:44:33,16 --> 0:44:34,3
ANOUSKA: Conditioning.


1122
0:44:34,3 --> 0:44:37,2
FEMALE SPEAKER: Body
conditioning, the actual


1123
0:44:37,2 --> 0:44:40,17
moves, just practising
the same old routines


1124
0:44:40,17 --> 0:44:41,18
and things like that.


1125
0:44:41,18 --> 0:44:42,91
She couldn't, like, go and see
her friends after school.


1126
0:44:42,91 --> 0:44:45,3
She couldn't do sleepovers,
anything like that.


1127
0:44:45,3 --> 0:44:48,15
So now, she's still doing her
gymnastics, but she only does


1128
0:44:48,15 --> 0:44:49,59
six hours a week.


1129
0:44:49,59 --> 0:44:51,55
INTERVIEWER: It's a big thing
in Liverpool, isn't it?


1130
0:44:51,55 --> 0:44:53,29
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah,
it is, actually.


1131
0:44:53,29 --> 0:44:55,25
INTERVIEWER: Why is that?


1132
0:44:55,25 --> 0:44:56,47
MARCEL: It's a lot
bigger lately.


1133
0:44:56,47 --> 0:44:59,2
A lot of people want to get into
shape because they feel


1134
0:44:59,2 --> 0:45:0,31
like they need to keep up.


1135
0:45:0,31 --> 0:45:2,91
There's a lot more people seem
to be doing it now than say,


1136
0:45:2,91 --> 0:45:5,17
five years ago.


1137
0:45:5,17 --> 0:45:8,388
MALE ANNOUNCER: Right, that
completes the under 18s.


1138
0:45:8,388 --> 0:45:11,36
Closing round, and we'll
be moving on to


1139
0:45:11,36 --> 0:45:13,99
the under 21s shortly.


1140
0:45:13,99 --> 0:45:15,79
MALE SPEAKER: If you can psyche
your opponents out,


1141
0:45:15,79 --> 0:45:16,53
well, even better.


1142
0:45:16,53 --> 0:45:18,38
They might pose a little
bit worse than you.


1143
0:45:18,38 --> 0:45:21,258
You show off a bit more than
them and well, you've won it,


1144
0:45:21,258 --> 0:45:22,9
haven't you?


1145
0:45:22,9 --> 0:45:23,545
MALE SPEAKER: If the small
person looks small behind the


1146
0:45:23,545 --> 0:45:26,92
bigger person, let the small
person fight his way through


1147
0:45:26,92 --> 0:45:28,665
just to try and make them look
small again, make the big


1148
0:45:28,665 --> 0:45:29,83
opponent small.


1149
0:45:29,83 --> 0:45:30,81
MALE SPEAKER: If you're going
on that stage, you're going


1150
0:45:30,81 --> 0:45:31,59
out to win.


1151
0:45:31,59 --> 0:45:32,67
You can say you're not.


1152
0:45:32,67 --> 0:45:35,1
You can say whatever, but
you going out to win.


1153
0:45:35,1 --> 0:45:36,24
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, just don't
put your head down.


1154
0:45:36,24 --> 0:45:39,965
And whatever mistakes that
you pull you can work


1155
0:45:39,965 --> 0:45:40,56
hard on in the gym.


1156
0:45:40,56 --> 0:45:43,3
I mean, whatever things that
you lack on, go back to the


1157
0:45:43,3 --> 0:45:45,84
gym and try and build
up on those things.


1158
0:45:45,84 --> 0:45:49,534
And then come back and try and
beat that better opponent.


1159
0:45:49,534 --> 0:45:51,28
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, that's
what's he's done.


1160
0:45:51,28 --> 0:45:53,53
Well, tried to do, anyway.


1161
0:45:53,53 --> 0:45:55,3
Beat him last time.


1162
0:45:55,3 --> 0:45:57,72
Going to beat him again today.


1163
0:45:57,72 --> 0:45:59,856
Friendly competition,
that's all.


1164
0:45:59,856 --> 0:46:2,6
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, see
what the judges say.


1165
0:46:2,6 --> 0:46:2,7
Just see what happens.


1166
0:46:2,7 --> 0:46:3,43
I don't know.


1167
0:46:3,43 --> 0:46:5,2
It could happen, I don't know.


1168
0:46:5,2 --> 0:46:7,2
See how they feel.


1169
0:46:7,2 --> 0:46:8,612
He can try and put me off,
but it's not happening.


1170
0:46:8,612 --> 0:46:11,878



1171
0:46:11,878 --> 0:46:13,171
MALE SPEAKER: Every
bodybuilder's watched it a


1172
0:46:13,171 --> 0:46:14,421
million times.


1173
0:46:14,421 --> 0:46:16,69



1174
0:46:16,69 --> 0:46:18,21
MALE SPEAKER: Jay Cutler's
my idol.


1175
0:46:18,21 --> 0:46:20,77
Arnie boomed off bodybuilding,
full stop.


1176
0:46:20,77 --> 0:46:23,29
INTERVIEWER: What's your
favorite Arnie film?


1177
0:46:23,29 --> 0:46:25,38
MALE SPEAKER: I was watching
Predator last night, actually,


1178
0:46:25,38 --> 0:46:26,69
to psyche myself up.


1179
0:46:26,69 --> 0:46:28,53
Because they say it's war.


1180
0:46:28,53 --> 0:46:29,78
That's what it's like.


1181
0:46:29,78 --> 0:46:32,76



1182
0:46:32,76 --> 0:46:34,17
MALE SPEAKER: We watched a bit
of Pumping Iron just because I


1183
0:46:34,17 --> 0:46:34,73
brought it down.


1184
0:46:34,73 --> 0:46:36,3
And then we thought, oh, we'll
watch this, just get a bit,


1185
0:46:36,3 --> 0:46:37,38
like, in the moment.


1186
0:46:37,38 --> 0:46:40,58
INTERVIEWER: Did you ever
watch Kindergarten Cop?


1187
0:46:40,58 --> 0:46:42,52
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, I've
watched all his films a


1188
0:46:42,52 --> 0:46:43,64
million times.


1189
0:46:43,64 --> 0:46:47,14
Because from a young age, that's
the physique that I've


1190
0:46:47,14 --> 0:46:49,775
found he's brought,
for men, to have.


1191
0:46:49,775 --> 0:46:51,26
Do you know what I mean?

INTERVIEWER: Did you win?


1194
0:47:30,86 --> 0:47:32,11
MALE SPEAKER: Twice.


1195
0:47:32,11 --> 0:47:36,8



1196
0:47:36,8 --> 0:47:38,5
Both of them.

0:47:38,5 --> 0:47:41,82



1198
0:47:41,82 --> 0:47:42,78
MALE SPEAKER: Do you know
what I mean, fair


1199
0:47:42,78 --> 0:47:44,25
enough, he won, he won.


1200
0:47:44,25 --> 0:47:45,27
MALE SPEAKER: More
competitive, do


1201
0:47:45,27 --> 0:47:45,97
you know what I mean?


1202
0:47:45,97 --> 0:47:47,22
It's what we do it for.


1203
0:47:47,22 --> 0:47:50,35



1204
0:47:50,35 --> 0:47:51,89
MALE SPEAKER: Give me a year.


1205
0:47:51,89 --> 0:47:54,48
We'll probably look up to them
as a bit of an idol.


1206
0:47:54,48 --> 0:47:55,93
We look up going, yeah,
we could end up


1207
0:47:55,93 --> 0:47:57,3
building up to that.


1208
0:47:57,3 --> 0:47:59,55
Fair enough, we're only young
and still growing.


1209
0:47:59,55 --> 0:48:1,22
Work the crowd, that's
what it's all


1210
0:48:1,22 --> 0:48:1,79
about, working the crowd.


1211
0:48:1,79 --> 0:48:3,4
[INAUDIBLE]


1212
0:48:3,4 --> 0:48:11,93



1213
0:48:11,93 --> 0:48:13,68
MALE SPEAKER: It's very
difficult to assess how


1214
0:48:13,68 --> 0:48:15,28
widespread Melanotan is.


1215
0:48:15,28 --> 0:48:20,58
It's legal to buy
and to possess.


1216
0:48:20,58 --> 0:48:23,31
Or rather, it's not illegal
to do that.


1217
0:48:23,31 --> 0:48:26,9
But it's technically
illegal to sell it.


1218
0:48:26,9 --> 0:48:29,67
The kits that were provided over
the internet tended to


1219
0:48:29,67 --> 0:48:34,1
have only a couple of syringes
in them, which isn't enough,


1220
0:48:34,1 --> 0:48:37,25
even remotely enough, for
a course of injections.


1221
0:48:37,25 --> 0:48:42,4
You know, we're hearing of
completely unusual groups of


1222
0:48:42,4 --> 0:48:43,67
people going into needle
exchanges.


1223
0:48:43,67 --> 0:48:46,83
So they weren't bodybuilders
or steroid users.


1224
0:48:46,83 --> 0:48:48,98
They weren't heroin
or opiate users.


1225
0:48:48,98 --> 0:48:52,38
They were working mums going
in with their daughters and


1226
0:48:52,38 --> 0:48:54,9
things like this.


1227
0:48:54,9 --> 0:48:56,43
It stimulates the receptors
in the skin to


1228
0:48:56,43 --> 0:48:59,9
produce the skin pigment.


1229
0:48:59,9 --> 0:49:2,9
One form of it, supposedly,
gives you a libido boost


1230
0:49:2,9 --> 0:49:5,37
within a very short
space of time.


1231
0:49:5,37 --> 0:49:7,74
We've had reports of
people's genitals


1232
0:49:7,74 --> 0:49:10,17
supposedly turning purple.


1233
0:49:10,17 --> 0:49:12,97
How do you tell them it's a
bad idea when, from their


1234
0:49:12,97 --> 0:49:15,64
point of view, at least, what
they're doing is taking


1235
0:49:15,64 --> 0:49:17,65
something which is going
to make them look


1236
0:49:17,65 --> 0:49:19,55
better and feel horny?


1237
0:49:19,55 --> 0:49:22,11



1238
0:49:22,11 --> 0:49:23,75
FEMALE SPEAKER: I hate it when
there's a bubble in it.


1239
0:49:23,75 --> 0:49:26,6
You see, you can't administer
it with a bubble in it.


1240
0:49:26,6 --> 0:49:27,31
That can kill you.


1241
0:49:27,31 --> 0:49:30,35



1242
0:49:30,35 --> 0:49:33,69
So what you do is you rub
the area where you're


1243
0:49:33,69 --> 0:49:37,29
going to put it.


1244
0:49:37,29 --> 0:49:43,243
And then you grab the bit
of skin like that, and


1245
0:49:43,243 --> 0:50:0,604
then and that's it.


1246
0:50:0,604 --> 0:50:1,99
You can feel it going
in your system.


1247
0:50:1,99 --> 0:50:4,65



1248
0:50:4,65 --> 0:50:6,48
To be perfectly honest with you,
I feel a bit sick off the


1249
0:50:6,48 --> 0:50:8,47
5ml I had before.


1250
0:50:8,47 --> 0:50:11,925
Bloody hell, that really
hurt, that one.


1251
0:50:11,925 --> 0:50:14,29
A girl has put it into
her stomach before


1252
0:50:14,29 --> 0:50:16,3
now and nearly died.


1253
0:50:16,3 --> 0:50:19,18
She's got the needle, and
she's gone that way, and


1254
0:50:19,18 --> 0:50:21,548
nearly died.


1255
0:50:21,548 --> 0:50:22,277
INTERVIEWER: Because
she injected


1256
0:50:22,277 --> 0:50:23,31
right into the stomach?


1257
0:50:23,31 --> 0:50:24,98
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah, you're
not meant to do that.


1258
0:50:24,98 --> 0:50:29,18
I mean, I don't really think
people should be administering


1259
0:50:29,18 --> 0:50:31,175
needles that aren't
nurses, anyway, to


1260
0:50:31,175 --> 0:50:32,425
be perfectly honest.


1261
0:50:32,425 --> 0:50:36,36



1262
0:50:36,36 --> 0:50:39,38
The most ones who say, it's
not meant to be about


1263
0:50:39,38 --> 0:50:41,18
appearance and all that are the
ones that are bitter and


1264
0:50:41,18 --> 0:50:42,44
resentful inside.


1265
0:50:42,44 --> 0:50:44,5
And they're usually
the ones that


1266
0:50:44,5 --> 0:50:45,8
are jealous and resentful.


1267
0:50:45,8 --> 0:50:46,0
And that is ugly.


1268
0:50:46,0 --> 0:50:47,58
That's an ugly character.


1269
0:50:47,58 --> 0:50:49,73
So therefore, not only are they
not nice on the outside,


1270
0:50:49,73 --> 0:50:51,44
but they're not nice
on the inside.


1271
0:50:51,44 --> 0:50:53,89
And not being nice on the inside
is a lot more tragic


1272
0:50:53,89 --> 0:50:55,37
than them not being nice
on the outside.


1273
0:50:55,37 --> 0:51:12,555



1274
0:51:12,555 --> 0:51:14,34
INTERVIEWER: When did
you get that done?


1275
0:51:14,34 --> 0:51:18,29
FEMALE SPEAKER: About five,
six years ago now, when


1276
0:51:18,29 --> 0:51:21,2
Liverpool won their fifth
Champion's League.


1277
0:51:21,2 --> 0:51:23,97
Regret it a little bit now I'm
older because think it's a bit


1278
0:51:23,97 --> 0:51:25,37
chavvy on a girl now.


1279
0:51:25,37 --> 0:51:26,75
INTERVIEWER: Have you been in
this competition before?


1280
0:51:26,75 --> 0:51:27,11
FEMALE SPEAKER: I haven't, no.


1281
0:51:27,11 --> 0:51:28,59
This is my first year.


1282
0:51:28,59 --> 0:51:30,33
So I'm a bit nervous.


1283
0:51:30,33 --> 0:51:32,11
INTERVIEWER: What time did you
start getting ready today?


1284
0:51:32,11 --> 0:51:34,62
FEMALE SPEAKER: I went to my
brother's girlfriend's, and


1285
0:51:34,62 --> 0:51:37,31
she started doing my hair and
my eyelashes and all that


1286
0:51:37,31 --> 0:51:40,69
about a quarter to nine this
morning when it all started.


1287
0:51:40,69 --> 0:51:43,12
I was in the Asda at half eight
picking my last little


1288
0:51:43,12 --> 0:51:45,412
bits of lacquer and everything
like that up.


1289
0:51:45,412 --> 0:51:48,1
I've just drove here today
in my rollers.


1290
0:51:48,1 --> 0:51:49,72
I had to keep on saying to the
girls, every time I was


1291
0:51:49,72 --> 0:51:51,2
getting out of the car
and in the car, I


1292
0:51:51,2 --> 0:51:51,52
kept on whacking them.


1293
0:51:51,52 --> 0:51:53,546
So they're all falling
out now.


1294
0:51:53,546 --> 0:51:55,37
Kept on forgetting to duck
my head when I was


1295
0:51:55,37 --> 0:51:56,47
getting out of the car.


1296
0:51:56,47 --> 0:51:58,8

You've got to do it.


1298
0:51:59,59 --> 0:52:1,1
You've got to be humiliated.

laughing at you when you run


1301
0:52:5,69 --> 0:52:7,33
in the shop with them on .


1302
0:52:7,33 --> 0:52:9,61
Like I say, if you want to look
good then you've got to


1303
0:52:9,61 --> 0:52:11,65
do this stuff.

0:52:11,65 --> 0:52:15,19
It's the only way your hair's
gonna stay big, really.


1305
0:52:15,19 --> 0:52:17,48
FEMALE SPEAKER: I said their
answers all seemed a little


1306
0:52:17,48 --> 0:52:19,472
regurgitated.


1307
0:52:19,472 --> 0:52:21,73
No, they do though,
don't they?


1308
0:52:21,73 --> 0:52:23,24
Because they say, why do
you want to be a model?


1309
0:52:23,24 --> 0:52:24,9
Oh, I really want to
help the world.


1310
0:52:24,9 --> 0:52:27,0
I want to help people.


1311
0:52:27,0 --> 0:52:27,46
No, you don't.


1312
0:52:27,46 --> 0:52:31,95
You just got that off fucking
a magazine or telly.

You have all the girls
waiting in here.

three questions that they've


1319
0:52:49,49 --> 0:52:50,763
pre-prepared.


1320

And then they're going
to walk out.

slag them off and write down


1322

0:55:12,869 --> 0:55:14,348
FEMALE ANNOUNCER:
Second place.


1351
0:55:14,348 --> 0:55:20,757
MALE ANNOUNCER: Runner-up
in Miss Liverpool 2010.

FEMALE ANNOUNCER: It's Serena,
Serena Stregapede!

0:55:27,43 --> 0:55:44,155



1355
0:55:44,155 --> 0:55:47,65
SERENA STREGAPEDE: Absolutely
over the moon.


1356
0:55:47,65 --> 0:55:49,455
I feel like I've won because
of the way I was


1357
0:55:49,455 --> 0:55:50,525
and the way I felt.


1358
0:55:50,525 --> 0:55:53,89
I can't believe that I did come
second because my nerves


1359
0:55:53,89 --> 0:55:55,785
were just shot, for
some reason.


1360
0:55:55,785 --> 0:55:58,755
But I'm absolutely buzzing
that I've come second.


1361
0:55:58,755 --> 0:56:0,24
I'm gonna go and get
bladdered now.

0:56:27,96 --> 0:56:34,89



1365
0:56:34,89 --> 0:56:37,5
MALE SPEAKER: And I think vanity
is the greatest thing


1366
0:56:37,5 --> 0:56:38,5
in the world.


1367
0:56:38,5 --> 0:56:40,28
Always have done.


1368
0:56:40,28 --> 0:56:43,3
And people are vain about most
things, even if they're not


1369
0:56:43,3 --> 0:56:44,81
vain about themselves.


1370
0:56:44,81 --> 0:56:48,38
You have a moral obligation
to look smart.


1371
0:56:48,38 --> 0:56:50,82
I took four youngsters to
the Dorchester Hotel.


1372
0:56:50,82 --> 0:56:53,5
It was a hairdressing
function, right?


1373
0:56:53,5 --> 0:56:56,37
So when I get to the top of
the stairs, watch all the


1374
0:56:56,37 --> 0:57:1,89
television cameras and all the
photographers come over to me.


1375
0:57:1,89 --> 0:57:5,37
I go to the top of the stairs
and sure enough, saw all the


1376
0:57:5,37 --> 0:57:7,345
lights running over to me.


1377
0:57:7,345 --> 0:57:9,3
And they were taking
photographs.


1378
0:57:9,3 --> 0:57:11,88
And I said to the youngsters,
now, tell me


1379
0:57:11,88 --> 0:57:14,7
why they came over.


1380
0:57:14,7 --> 0:57:15,74
Was it me?


1381
0:57:15,74 --> 0:57:17,24
Or was it the pink suit?


1382
0:57:17,24 --> 0:59:17,24
