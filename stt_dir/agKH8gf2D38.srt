0:0:6,399 --> 0:0:9,73
THE PRESIDENT: Thanks for coming by to say
hello. Mr. Chairman, thank you for your kind


2
0:0:9,73 --> 0:0:16,82
introduction, and thanks for the invitation
to tour this impressive facility. The restart


3
0:0:16,82 --> 0:0:23,109
of Browns Ferry Unit Number 1 represents the
first nuclear reactor to come online in the


4
0:0:23,109 --> 0:0:39,379
United States in more than a decade. (Applause.)
This is a demonstration that one is capable


5
0:0:39,379 --> 0:0:47,76
of doing a job on time and on budget. And
I congratulate you all for your hard work,


6
0:0:47,76 --> 0:0:51,549
and thank you for the contribution you're
making to the United States of America.


7
0:0:51,549 --> 0:0:59,949
I'm going to talk a little bit about nuclear
power today, and there's no better place to


8
0:0:59,949 --> 0:1:5,189
do it here than with a group of folks who
understand the great benefits of nuclear power


9
0:1:5,189 --> 0:1:12,83
to our country. I believe that it is essential
that we have a comprehensive energy policy


10
0:1:12,83 --> 0:1:18,25
to be able to deal with the challenges we're
going to face in the 21st century, whether


11
0:1:18,25 --> 0:1:24,35
that be energy independence or economic security
or good environmental policy. And at the core


12
0:1:24,35 --> 0:1:35,3
of such policy must be electricity generated
from nuclear power. (Applause.)


13
0:1:35,3 --> 0:1:43,11
I'm also here to nudge Congress along. They're
working on a bill -- (laughter) -- that I


14
0:1:43,11 --> 0:1:47,86
hope that they can get to my desk, that is
a good bill, a balanced bill, a reasonable


15
0:1:47,86 --> 0:1:54,729
approach to making sure we continue to be
wise about how we use energy in the United


16
0:1:54,729 --> 0:1:54,95
States.


17
0:1:54,95 --> 0:1:59,39
I do want to thank Bill for his leadership,
and I thank the members of the board of the


18
0:1:59,39 --> 0:2:6,71
TVA. I thank Tom Kilgore for taking time to
visit today. He's led me on a tour with R.G.


19
0:2:6,71 --> 0:2:18,159
Jones. Some of you may have heard of R.G.
(Applause.) R.G. and I discovered we're both


20
0:2:18,159 --> 0:2:25,159
60. (Laughter.) We were born in 1946, which
is a fine year to be born, at least as far


21
0:2:25,159 --> 0:2:32,579
as R.G. and I are concerned. (Laughter.) I
reminded him 60 is not as old as it used to


22
0:2:32,579 --> 0:2:37,239
sound -- until I climbed up all those stairs
to get to the control room. (Laughter.) I


23
0:2:37,239 --> 0:2:46,65
also want to thank Brian O'Grady, the Vice
President here. (Applause.)


24
0:2:46,65 --> 0:2:53,279
Put a good man who understands nuclear power
as the head of the Energy Department, Sam


25
0:2:53,279 --> 0:2:58,999
Bodman. He's with us today. Mr. Secretary,
thank you for traveling with us. Appreciate


26
0:2:58,999 --> 0:3:6,159
you coming. (Applause.) Also with us is Dr.
Dale Klein, Chairman of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory


27
0:3:6,159 --> 0:3:13,959
Commission. It's an important position. It's
a position that's going to expedite the regulations


28
0:3:13,959 --> 0:3:18,489
so we can get more plants up and running.
And I'll talk a little bit about his intentions


29
0:3:18,489 --> 0:3:23,99
and our intentions to help increase nuclear
power here in the United States.


30
0:3:23,99 --> 0:3:34,359
I'm traveling with a fine United States Senator,
in Jeff Sessions. (Applause.) As well as the


31
0:3:34,359 --> 0:3:37,939
Congressman from this district, a man awfully
proud of the work you do here, and that's


32
0:3:37,939 --> 0:3:47,499
Bud Cramer. (Applause.) Finally, we let a
fellow from Mobile tag along with us, Congressman


33
0:3:47,499 --> 0:3:48,299
Jo Bonner. Appreciate you coming, Congressman.
(Applause.)


34
0:3:48,299 --> 0:3:57,249
I thank all the employees who work at this
plant. Thanks for what you're doing. Thanks


35
0:3:57,249 --> 0:4:2,299
for being skillful. Thanks for working hard.
Thanks for helping the country.


36
0:4:2,299 --> 0:4:8,639
The world is seeing the promise and potential
of the peaceful use of nuclear energy. I emphasize


37
0:4:8,639 --> 0:4:14,73
that word, peaceful use, because one of my
predecessors, Dwight David Eisenhower, in


38
0:4:14,73 --> 0:4:19,919
1953 called on the world's scientists and
engineers to find a way to produce peaceful


39
0:4:19,919 --> 0:4:27,62
power from atomic energy that would serve
the needs, rather than the fears, of mankind.


40
0:4:27,62 --> 0:4:32,699
That's exactly what we're doing here. You're
serving the needs, rather than the fears,


41
0:4:32,699 --> 0:4:40,25
of mankind. You're helping implement the vision
of President Dwight David Eisenhower.


42
0:4:40,25 --> 0:4:45,86
Nuclear power is America's third leading source
of electricity. It provides nearly 20 percent


43
0:4:45,86 --> 0:4:50,34
of our country's electricity. I don't know
if a lot of our citizens understand that,


44
0:4:50,34 --> 0:4:57,31
but nuclear power is a key component of economic
vitality, because it provides 20 percent of


45
0:4:57,31 --> 0:4:58,169
the electricity.


46
0:4:58,169 --> 0:5:3,68
Interestingly enough, nuclear power provides
78 percent of electricity for France, provides


47
0:5:3,68 --> 0:5:12,699
50 percent for Sweden, 30 percent for the
entire European Union. China has nine nuclear


48
0:5:12,699 --> 0:5:19,879
reactors in operation and has ambitious plans
to build many more over the next two decades.


49
0:5:19,879 --> 0:5:26,33
Nuclear power is prevalent and it's recognized
as a necessary power source, not only here


50
0:5:26,33 --> 0:5:36,0
in the United States, but around the world.
Nuclear power is clean. It's clean, domestic


51
0:5:36,0 --> 0:5:40,8
energy. There is a lot of discussion about
the environment, as there should be. We certainly


52
0:5:40,8 --> 0:5:43,96
want to leave the environment better for the
next generation that comes along. There's


53
0:5:43,96 --> 0:5:50,629
a lot of discussion about greenhouse gases,
which I believe is a serious problem.


54
0:5:50,629 --> 0:5:56,77
And therefore, I remind those who share my
concern about greenhouse gases that nuclear


55
0:5:56,77 --> 0:6:2,8
energy produces no greenhouse gases. If you
are interested in cleaning up the air, then


56
0:6:2,8 --> 0:6:14,9
you ought to be an advocate for nuclear power.
(Applause.) Without nuclear power here in


57
0:6:14,9 --> 0:6:18,159
the United States, there would be nearly 700
million additional tons of carbon dioxide


58
0:6:18,159 --> 0:6:25,3
in the atmosphere every year. There is no
single solution to climate change, but there


59
0:6:25,3 --> 0:6:30,61
can be no solution without nuclear power.


60
0:6:30,61 --> 0:6:36,58
Nuclear power is safe. The nuclear sector
is one of the safest industries in the United


61
0:6:36,58 --> 0:6:43,389
States. Advances in science and engineering
and plant design have made nuclear plants


62
0:6:43,389 --> 0:6:49,509
even safer than the last generation of plants.
In other words, technology has advanced, knowledge


63
0:6:49,509 --> 0:6:53,939
has advanced, engineering has advanced. This
is a safe plant and the people in the United


64
0:6:53,939 --> 0:6:55,74
States must understand that.


65
0:6:55,74 --> 0:7:1,11
They've also got to understand that NRC inspectors
are stationed full time at these plants to


66
0:7:1,11 --> 0:7:5,71
provide daily inspections, and I appreciate
the NRC inspectors who are with us today.


67
0:7:5,71 --> 0:7:11,889
In other words, we go extra steps to be able
to say to the American people, this is a safe


68
0:7:11,889 --> 0:7:17,65
place to work and it's a safe facility to
have in the area of the country in which you


69
0:7:17,65 --> 0:7:19,37
live.


70
0:7:19,37 --> 0:7:27,12
Nuclear power is affordable and it is reliable.
Once a nuclear plant is constructed, fuel


71
0:7:27,12 --> 0:7:34,849
and operating costs are low. The cost of electricity
from a nuclear power plant is stable. It is


72
0:7:34,849 --> 0:7:44,21
predictable. The cost of electricity from
a plant like this doesn't fluctuate the way


73
0:7:44,21 --> 0:7:50,379
plants fired by natural gas can fluctuate.
The flow of power is not intermittent like


74
0:7:50,379 --> 0:7:57,319
the wind. This is a reliable source of low-cost
energy.


75
0:7:57,319 --> 0:8:2,71
We need nuclear power to play a greater role
in our future. That's what I want to share


76
0:8:2,71 --> 0:8:9,55
with you and the American people, as we talk
about a comprehensive energy strategy, a comprehensive


77
0:8:9,55 --> 0:8:16,189
energy plan, nuclear power has got to be a
really important part of our future.


78
0:8:16,189 --> 0:8:19,87
Nuclear power is the only large-scale emissions-free
power source that is currently able to meet


79
0:8:19,87 --> 0:8:27,34
the growing need for electricity. As our economy
grows, with additional demands for power and


80
0:8:27,34 --> 0:8:30,379
electricity, nuclear power can handle those
needs.


81
0:8:30,379 --> 0:8:34,36
In order to keep pace with our nuclear energy
needs, experts believe it will be necessary


82
0:8:34,36 --> 0:8:39,1
to build an average of three new plants per
year starting in 2015. In other words, it's


83
0:8:39,1 --> 0:8:43,75
one thing to talk about nuclear power; it's
another thing to have -- understand the strategy


84
0:8:43,75 --> 0:8:45,23
necessary.


85
0:8:45,23 --> 0:8:49,9
So we are going to need three plants starting
in 2015. And as we tackle climate change,


86
0:8:49,9 --> 0:8:56,28
it may be necessary to have even more plants.
Here's the problem: Our country has not ordered


87
0:8:56,28 --> 0:9:5,9
a new nuclear power plant since the 1970s,
partially as a result of constant litigation


88
0:9:5,9 --> 0:9:12,79
and overly complex regulations. So we're working
to overcome those obstacles. I appreciate


89
0:9:12,79 --> 0:9:19,21
the fact that the TVA is making decisions
to move forward nuclear power. It's time for


90
0:9:19,21 --> 0:9:24,12
our country to start building nuclear power
plants again. That's what I want to share


91
0:9:24,12 --> 0:9:28,8
with you. (Applause.)


92
0:9:28,8 --> 0:9:38,21
One thing to restart one, and I congratulate
you. It's another thing to build the new ones.


93
0:9:38,21 --> 0:9:43,29
And that's what we ought to have happen if
we're interested in a comprehensive, sound,


94
0:9:43,29 --> 0:9:49,6
wise energy policy that is environmentally
friendly. The federal government is helping


95
0:9:49,6 --> 0:9:55,22
to expand the safe use of nuclear power in
some important ways. First, we've set up what's


96
0:9:55,22 --> 0:10:1,63
called the Nuclear Power 2010 initiative.
We launched the nuclear power initiative,


97
0:10:1,63 --> 0:10:6,16
which is a partnership between industry and
the U.S. government, to reduce regulatory


98
0:10:6,16 --> 0:10:11,66
and other barriers to the development of new
nuclear power plants. That's why we set it


99
0:10:11,66 --> 0:10:17,0
up. We want to start building plants, and
we recognize that there have been some regulatory


100
0:10:17,0 --> 0:10:23,7
burdens that prevent the construction of new
plants or at least discourage the construction


101
0:10:23,7 --> 0:10:24,93
of new plants.


102
0:10:24,93 --> 0:10:30,14
The 2008 budget I submitted would double the
requested funding for this initiative to $114


103
0:10:30,14 --> 0:10:35,9
million. In other words, it takes money to
get this initiative moving. And we're asking


104
0:10:35,9 --> 0:10:39,7
Congress to spend money on it in order to
help us put in a comprehensive energy strategy.


105
0:10:39,7 --> 0:10:47,8
It makes sense. It's just a common sense strategy.
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is working


106
0:10:47,8 --> 0:10:52,71
to improve and streamline the regulatory process
to help accelerate the construction of nuclear


107
0:10:52,71 --> 0:10:58,78
plants. Under the old system, the permitting
process was slow. Some of the older hands


108
0:10:58,78 --> 0:11:5,19
here might remember that. It was cumbersome,
because it limited builders to completing


109
0:11:5,19 --> 0:11:9,26
only one step at a time before moving on.
You could only do one thing, and then there


110
0:11:9,26 --> 0:11:13,87
would be regulatory deals, and another thing
-- and it just took a long time. And when


111
0:11:13,87 --> 0:11:20,11
something takes a long time to build, that
discourages capital and discourages people


112
0:11:20,11 --> 0:11:27,13
from moving forward. Plus you could get sued
all the time. That would discourage people,


113
0:11:27,13 --> 0:11:28,62
as well.


114
0:11:28,62 --> 0:11:32,68
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is implementing
a more efficient review process that allows


115
0:11:32,68 --> 0:11:37,62
builders to complete several steps at a time
without compromising safety. They took a good


116
0:11:37,62 --> 0:11:42,54
look at the problems, they said we need more
nuclear power, and so we're going to streamline


117
0:11:42,54 --> 0:11:49,33
the process. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission
now expects 20 applications for combined construction


118
0:11:49,33 --> 0:11:54,55
and operating licenses for up to 30 new reactors.
In other words, we're beginning to make some


119
0:11:54,55 --> 0:11:59,81
progress. Things are beginning to change.
Attitudes are changing, and so is the regulatory


120
0:11:59,81 --> 0:12:6,46
process, which has enabled me to tell you
we've got 20 applications for up to 30 new


121
0:12:6,46 --> 0:12:11,24
reactors. That is good news for the American
consumer. (Applause.)


122
0:12:11,24 --> 0:12:19,64
We think that we ought to -- America ought
to -- should be able to start construction


123
0:12:19,64 --> 0:12:26,88
on additional nuclear plants by the end of
this decade. That's not all that far away.


124
0:12:26,88 --> 0:12:31,34
So I've got the Chairman of the NRC here.
I want him to hear what I just said. (Laughter.)


125
0:12:31,34 --> 0:12:36,43
He's doing some good work. He's got more work
to do.


126
0:12:36,43 --> 0:12:44,14
I signed an energy bill in 2005 that included
important incentives to support the development


127
0:12:44,14 --> 0:12:51,24
of nuclear power, including federal risk insurance
for builders of new nuclear plants, loan guarantee


128
0:12:51,24 --> 0:12:56,69
eligibility and production tax credits. In
other words, to get this industry started,


129
0:12:56,69 --> 0:13:0,37
put some incentives out there for people that
would be spending the money to get the plants


130
0:13:0,37 --> 0:13:1,37
going.


131
0:13:1,37 --> 0:13:9,28
We're working to settle the issue of storage
for nuclear waste. That's an issue. More than


132
0:13:9,28 --> 0:13:14,23
55,000 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel and
high-level waste are stored at a hundred sites


133
0:13:14,23 --> 0:13:22,64
in 39 states. I've submitted a budget of $495
million to continue progress on licensing


134
0:13:22,64 --> 0:13:27,82
Yucca Mountain as a repository for spent fuel.


135
0:13:27,82 --> 0:13:33,62
There's also another idea that I want you
to -- I know you know about it, but I want


136
0:13:33,62 --> 0:13:39,2
Americans and Congress to consider. We ought
to do something about reprocessing. We ought


137
0:13:39,2 --> 0:13:49,85
to bring that technology to bear. (Applause.)
We ought to bring new technologies to bear


138
0:13:49,85 --> 0:13:57,91
to help us all deal with the spent fuel. So
we proposed a global nuclear energy partnership


139
0:13:57,91 --> 0:14:4,51
to work with nations with advanced civilian
nuclear energy programs, such as France, Japan,


140
0:14:4,51 --> 0:14:10,53
China, and Russia. And the reason why we proposed
this partnership is we want to use technologies,


141
0:14:10,53 --> 0:14:17,22
new technologies -- develop and use technologies
that effectively and safely recycle spent


142
0:14:17,22 --> 0:14:20,5
nuclear fuel.


143
0:14:20,5 --> 0:14:25,7
Reprocessing spent uranium fuel for use in
advanced reactors will allow us to extract


144
0:14:25,7 --> 0:14:31,43
more energy and has the potential to reduce
storage requirements for nuclear waste by


145
0:14:31,43 --> 0:14:38,41
up to 90 percent. I am confident that we can
have the technological breakthroughs necessary


146
0:14:38,41 --> 0:14:45,86
to deal with the fuel. Congress needs to spend
the money in order to do the research. And


147
0:14:45,86 --> 0:14:50,88
when we do, we will be able to answer a lot
of the charges of our critics that say, what


148
0:14:50,88 --> 0:14:50,95
are you going to do with the fuel?


149
0:14:50,95 --> 0:14:59,77
Well, here's a good answer: Recycle it, reburn
it and reduce the amount of the problem. And


150
0:14:59,77 --> 0:15:8,12
that's what the United States needs to be
doing. (Applause.)


151
0:15:8,12 --> 0:15:14,37
Nuclear power is part of a broader strategy.
I want to spend a little time on the broader


152
0:15:14,37 --> 0:15:31,4
strategy before we all pass out in here. (Laughter.)
There's enough hot air in the room as there


153
0:15:31,4 --> 0:15:32,3
is. (Laughter.)


154
0:15:32,3 --> 0:15:38,67
We're too dependent on oil. And you know,
in 1985, about 27 percent of our oil came


155
0:15:38,67 --> 0:15:44,74
from other countries; today, about 60 percent
does. And that's a dependency that creates


156
0:15:44,74 --> 0:15:48,63
economic and national security problems for
us.


157
0:15:48,63 --> 0:15:54,19
On the national security side, our dependence
on oil leaves us more vulnerable to hostile


158
0:15:54,19 --> 0:15:59,38
regimes and terrorists. If you can blow up
oil facilities overseas, it will affect the


159
0:15:59,38 --> 0:16:4,76
price of oil here at home. When you're dependent
on something and somebody disrupts the supply


160
0:16:4,76 --> 0:16:11,1
on which you're dependent, it will affect
you. It effects international politics, to


161
0:16:11,1 --> 0:16:13,63
a certain extent, to be dependent on oil.


162
0:16:13,63 --> 0:16:21,5
When the price of oil goes up for whatever
reason overseas, it affects the price of gasoline


163
0:16:21,5 --> 0:16:28,52
here in northern Alabama. So there is an economic
issue for being dependent on oil. And, of


164
0:16:28,52 --> 0:16:36,44
course, when oil is burned as a fuel, it effects
the environment. So we've got to change our


165
0:16:36,44 --> 0:16:37,82
dependency.


166
0:16:37,82 --> 0:16:43,89
One way to do so is to spend some of your
money on new technologies that will change


167
0:16:43,89 --> 0:16:50,75
how we live in positive ways. So we spent
$12 billion since I've been the President


168
0:16:50,75 --> 0:16:54,61
to develop cleaner, cheaper and more reliable
energy sources. I think that's a wise use


169
0:16:54,61 --> 0:17:2,57
of your money -- to encourage research and
development on new ways to drive your cars,


170
0:17:2,57 --> 0:17:4,35
for example.


171
0:17:4,35 --> 0:17:13,569
One such example is -- that we're spending
your money on is for clean coal technologies.


172
0:17:13,569 --> 0:17:18,449
We've got to do something to make sure that
when we have electricity generated by coal


173
0:17:18,449 --> 0:17:22,89
that we can say to future generations of Americans
that we're going to protect the environment,


174
0:17:22,89 --> 0:17:27,79
as well. We've got a lot of coal. If you want
to be less dependent on foreign sources of


175
0:17:27,79 --> 0:17:31,82
oil, you ought to use the energy sources you've
got here at home. Not all electricity is going


176
0:17:31,82 --> 0:17:36,34
to be generated as a result of nuclear power.
We're going to be burning coal. And so we


177
0:17:36,34 --> 0:17:42,56
are spending a lot of money, and I believe
that we'll have emission-free coal plants


178
0:17:42,56 --> 0:17:46,3
that will capture and remove virtually all
air pollutants and greenhouse gases from burning


179
0:17:46,3 --> 0:17:48,5
coal. That's what the experts tell me.


180
0:17:48,5 --> 0:17:53,28
So some of your money, some of your hard-earned
money is going to encourage that kind of research.


181
0:17:53,28 --> 0:17:59,14
I think it's worth it. And I know it's necessary
if we want to be less dependent on oil and


182
0:17:59,14 --> 0:18:0,87
be good about how we deal with the environment.


183
0:18:0,87 --> 0:18:8,27
And we're also spending money to help others
research wind and solar power. That's a nice


184
0:18:8,27 --> 0:18:12,52
alternative. It's certainly not going to -- wind
power is not going to be nearly as effective


185
0:18:12,52 --> 0:18:17,68
and efficient as nuclear power, but it can
be a part of the mix.


186
0:18:17,68 --> 0:18:22,99
If you want to affect dependency on oil, then
we've got to figure out how to use -- put


187
0:18:22,99 --> 0:18:32,2
different power sources in our cars. Gasoline
is oil. You know, so when you say I'm using


188
0:18:32,2 --> 0:18:37,65
gasoline, you really are using oil. Because
that's how -- that's where gasoline comes


189
0:18:37,65 --> 0:18:46,22
from. And so one idea that we're working on
is to encourage ethanol, which works. See,


190
0:18:46,22 --> 0:18:51,87
if you're driving your automobile based upon
something a farmer grows here in northern


191
0:18:51,87 --> 0:18:57,35
Alabama, as opposed to something that's as
a result of buying from overseas -- makes


192
0:18:57,35 --> 0:18:58,2
sense to me.


193
0:18:58,2 --> 0:19:1,92
You've got your farmer growing something that
powers your automobile, I think it puts us


194
0:19:1,92 --> 0:19:6,9
in a much better position economically, from
a national security perspective. And we're


195
0:19:6,9 --> 0:19:11,22
spending a fair amount of your money to make
sure that we can use something other than


196
0:19:11,22 --> 0:19:16,4
corn from which to make ethanol. If you're
a hog farmer, you're getting tired of seeing


197
0:19:16,4 --> 0:19:23,33
the corn prices go up. If you're a corn farmer,
it's a nice feeling to see the prices go up.


198
0:19:23,33 --> 0:19:24,11
(Laughter.)


199
0:19:24,11 --> 0:19:30,59
But we believe we can come up with technologies
that will enable us to use wood chips to make


200
0:19:30,59 --> 0:19:35,29
ethanol that you can put in your automobiles
to help us become less dependent on oil, or


201
0:19:35,29 --> 0:19:39,86
switchgrasses. That would be nice for some
of the people from my state. Switchgrass grows


202
0:19:39,86 --> 0:19:44,99
in a nice dry environment. I understand you're
dry here, by the way. The senator and the


203
0:19:44,99 --> 0:19:49,31
congressmen are working hard on me about the
drought that you've got here. (Laughter.)


204
0:19:49,31 --> 0:19:54,96
But some parts of our country need to -- have
got dry country and they can grow some switchgrass.


205
0:19:54,96 --> 0:20:1,0
The whole idea is to come up with different
ways to power our automobiles. And along those


206
0:20:1,0 --> 0:20:6,19
lines, I think it's not going to be long before
you're going to be able to drive an automobile


207
0:20:6,19 --> 0:20:11,41
with new battery technologies that you can
just plug in to your garage. And your automobile


208
0:20:11,41 --> 0:20:24,36
won't look like a golf cart. It will be a
normal size pickup truck. (Laughter and applause.)


209
0:20:24,36 --> 0:20:30,65
So I laid out a goal that said we're going
to reduce our gasoline usage by 20 percent


210
0:20:30,65 --> 0:20:40,23
over 10 years as a part of our energy diversification
strategy. And I think we can achieve that.


211
0:20:40,23 --> 0:20:44,45
I also know we need to change our fuel economy
standards just like we did for trucks, and


212
0:20:44,45 --> 0:20:46,69
I want to work with Congress to do that as
well.


213
0:20:46,69 --> 0:20:52,17
In other words, it's part of a comprehensive
strategy. I call it the 20-10 goal. And I


214
0:20:52,17 --> 0:20:57,28
commend Congress for pursuing the framework
for the 20-10 proposal. It's a promising start.


215
0:20:57,28 --> 0:21:2,72
However, as bills get written, it's being
frustrated by special interests and, of course,


216
0:21:2,72 --> 0:21:6,97
all the politics that takes place in Washington,
D.C.


217
0:21:6,97 --> 0:21:12,63
The current plan being debated in the Senate
falls far short of the ambitious goal I laid


218
0:21:12,63 --> 0:21:19,72
out. But it's a realistic goal. It's a necessary
goal if we want to become less dependent on


219
0:21:19,72 --> 0:21:25,48
oil from overseas. The Senate's proposed fuel
mandate, for example, calls for just a 10


220
0:21:25,48 --> 0:21:30,68
percent reduction in gasoline usage by 2017.
We can do much better than that. We really


221
0:21:30,68 --> 0:21:35,61
can. We've got to be optimistic about what
America can do when we put our mind to doing


222
0:21:35,61 --> 0:21:35,86
something.


223
0:21:35,86 --> 0:21:43,78
And so I urge the Congress to be realistic
about the bills they're talking about and


224
0:21:43,78 --> 0:21:49,71
get it done. Get it to my desk so we can all
say we've done a good job of representing


225
0:21:49,71 --> 0:21:50,16
the people.


226
0:21:50,16 --> 0:21:55,58
By the way, as we talk about these new technologies,
we're still going to need oil and gas. And


227
0:21:55,58 --> 0:22:0,559
we can explore for oil and gas in environmentally
friendly ways. I strongly believe that we


228
0:22:0,559 --> 0:22:6,94
ought to open up more outer continental shelf
area, as well as ANWR in Alaska. You know,


229
0:22:6,94 --> 0:22:12,91
there's a big debate about whether or not
you can drill and find oil and gas that's


230
0:22:12,91 --> 0:22:16,73
good for you without ruining the environment.
I'm telling you we can. Technologies have


231
0:22:16,73 --> 0:22:18,38
changed. (Applause.)


232
0:22:18,38 --> 0:22:26,93
By the way, when they're debating the bill
up there, they've also got to fill up -- add


233
0:22:26,93 --> 0:22:32,9
to the strategic petroleum reserve. If you're
worried about a terrorist attack which could


234
0:22:32,9 --> 0:22:36,58
affect the price of oil, we ought to have
oil in the ground that we can use to protect


235
0:22:36,58 --> 0:22:44,87
the American consumer. And they need to expand
the petroleum reserve against natural disasters,


236
0:22:44,87 --> 0:22:49,53
protection against natural disasters, as well
as a potential attack.


237
0:22:49,53 --> 0:22:54,89
By the way, the Supreme Court -- I don't know
if you follow the Supreme Court at all, but


238
0:22:54,89 --> 0:22:58,87
they've ruled that the EPA must take action
under the Clean Air Act regarding greenhouse


239
0:22:58,87 --> 0:23:4,44
gas emissions from motor vehicles. That's
what the Court said. And when the Court says


240
0:23:4,44 --> 0:23:8,92
something, then the executive branch of government
says, okay, you said it, now we'll listen.


241
0:23:8,92 --> 0:23:10,82
We'll do what you asked us to do.


242
0:23:10,82 --> 0:23:16,85
And so I directed the EPA and the Department
of Transportation, Energy, and Agriculture


243
0:23:16,85 --> 0:23:21,95
to take the first steps toward regulations
that would cut gasoline consumption and greenhouse


244
0:23:21,95 --> 0:23:27,43
gases using the plan I just described to you.
So Congress can pass the law, which I hope


245
0:23:27,43 --> 0:23:31,9
they do, but if they don't, we're moving forward
because the Supreme Court told us to move


246
0:23:31,9 --> 0:23:36,7
forward. And either way, in either case, we're
going to become less dependent on oil, and


247
0:23:36,7 --> 0:23:43,42
that's good for the United States of America.
(Applause.)


248
0:23:43,42 --> 0:23:49,37
So I appreciate you letting me come by and
talk a little energy. You live it, I'm talking


249
0:23:49,37 --> 0:23:53,45
it. (Laughter.) I thank you for what you're
doing for the country. I thank you for your


250
0:23:53,45 --> 0:23:58,54
hard work, I thank you for your skill, I thank
you for your prayers. I thank you for being


251
0:23:58,54 --> 0:23:59,33
good Americans.


252
0:23:59,33 --> 0:25:59,33
And may God bless you. And may God bless our
country. Thank you all. (Applause.)
