###2 Ancient people saw them as messages from the Gods, as supernatural winds that blew from
###13 the realm of spirits.
###21 Modern science has linked these polar light shows, called auroras, to vast waves of electrified
###27 gas hurled in our direction by the sun.
###34 Today, researchers from a whole new generation see this dynamic substance, plasma, as an
###45 energy source that may one day fuel humanityÕs expansion into space.
###55 What can we learn, and how far can we go, by tapping into the strange and elusive fourth
###73 state of matter?
###88 Since the dawn of rocketry, weÕve relied on the same basic technology to get us off
###94 the ground. Fill a cylinder with volatile chemicals, then ignite them in a controlled
###103 explosion.
###106 The force of the blast is what pushes the rocket up.
###110 Nowadays, chemical rockets are the only ones with enough thrust to overcome EarthÕs gravity
###117 and carry a payload into orbit. But they are not very efficient.
###122 The heavier the payload, the more fuel a rocket needs to lift it into space. But the more
###131 fuel a rocket carries, the more fuel it needs.
###137 For long-range missions, most spacecraft rely on their initial launch speed to essentially
###144 coast to their destination.
###147 Flight planners often design routes that give the craft a gravity assist by sending it around
###153 the moon or another planet.
###161 One small cadre of scientists believes it has a quicker and more efficient way to get
###166 around in space.
###168 Dr. Ben Longmier and his team from the University of Michigan have traveled to Fairbanks, Alaska
###176 to play a small part in a much larger push to revolutionize space travel and exploration.
###184 The team plans to use helium balloons to send components of a new type of rocket engine
###190 to an altitude of over 30 kilometers, above 99% of EarthÕs atmosphere.
###200 The purpose is to test these components within the harsh environment of space.
###208 While astronauts train to live and work in zero gravity, or to move around in bulky space
###215 suits, these would-be space explorers are preparing to negotiate some of EarthÕs harshest
###223 environments.
###226 Once they launch their payload, they have to retrieve it wherever it comes down in AlaskaÕs
###231 vast snowy wilderness. The idea they are pursuing is nothing short of revolutionary.
###241 ItÕs a type of rocket that promises far greater gas mileage than other rockets, and enough
###248 power to reach distant targets.
###252 It runs on the same fuel that nature uses, literally, to power the universe.
###259 To understand it, we go back to the early moments of time and space.
###273 Not long after its explosive beginnings, the universe was awash in vast stores of hydrogen
###279 gas.
###283 But even as the universe continued to expand, gravity began to draw clumps of matter into
###289 ever-denser concentrations. The earliest stars took shape, immense balls of hydrogen gas,
###299 hundreds of times the mass of our sun.
###303 As they contracted inward, they heated up and ignited.
###309 Intense radiation now began to flow through the voids. That had the effect, all through
###315 the universe, of stripping electrons away from the primordial gas.
###322 The universe became filled, not with solids, liquid, or gas, but with a fourth state of
###329 matter: plasma.
###335 On our planet, plasma occurs only in rare circumstances: in a hot flame, a bolt of lightning,
###348 or in a blown electrical transformer.
###352 Made up of negatively charged electrons and positively charged ions, plasma is in most
###358 cases electrically neutral since the charges balance each other out.
###366 That led the physicist Irving Langmuir in the 1920s to compare it to the clear liquid,
###373 plasma, that carries blood cells through our bodies.
###377 The development of radio led to the discovery, high above the Earth, of a natural plasma
###383 ceiling, the ionosphere. It hovers above us, reflecting some radio frequencies and absorbing
###391 others.
###394 The discovery of immense radiation belts beyond our atmosphere opened the way to the study
###400 of plasma in space.
###406 Unlike most matter on Earth, plasma conducts electricity and responds to magnetic fields.
###415 These properties influence the formation of structures like galaxies and nebulae.
###423 They power high velocity jets that roar out of newborn stars or black holes.
###436 Studies of one giant nearby ball of plasma show what a complex and volatile substance
###442 it can be.
###448 In the core of our sun, high heat and crushing pressures cause hydrogen atoms to crash together.
###457 That sets off a nuclear reaction in which hydrogen atoms fuse into heavier ones like
###463 helium and carbon, generating heat.
###468 This heat slowly rises to the surface of the sun in vast plumes of plasma.
###476 You can see evidence of this process, called convection, in a pattern of ever evolving
###482 blobs known as granules.
###485 They are like the tops of thunderstorms.
###492 Even as energy builds within, the sunÕs gravity and density can stifle its escape.
###500 What carries it out are magnetic fields generated by the rising and sinking motion of hot plasma.
###511 They twist and wrap around, channeling energy to the surface.
###517 The fields can power immense loops of hot gas, about 60,000 degrees Celsius, that rise
###527 up from the solar surface and fall back.
###535 The sun can also erupt in giant waves of plasma that fly out from its surface.
###551 Called coronal mass ejections, they can reach up to 6 million miles per hour as they hurtle
###558 out across the solar system.
###562 When the solar wave strikes, it slams into EarthÕs own magnetic field.
###582 Because solar particles are charged, a portion follows the orientation of EarthÕs magnetic
###588 field lines. Finding an opening at the poles, they race down into the atmosphere.
###597 You know this is happening when you see the beautiful lights of the aurora borealis in
###610 the far north, or the aurora australis in the south.
###618 They appear when charged solar particles collide with oxygen molecules in the upper atmosphere,
###625 causing them to glow blue, red, and green depending on altitude.
###649 Flying through a zone called the thermosphere, some 350 kilometers above the earth, astronauts
###656 in the international space station watch in awe as the aurora shimmers, framed by the
###662 glow of stars and cities at night.
###672 ItÕs the explosive properties of plasma that have motivated the collaboration between NASA,
###682 BenÕs team, and a company that heÕs affiliated with: the Ad Astra Rocket Company of Houston,
###690 Texas.
###692 Because plasma does not occur naturally on Earth, the challenge is to create it, then
###697 harness it in a rocket engine.
###704 In the lab, the teams do this by injecting argon gas into a chamber. They bombard it
###710 with radio waves, which strip electrons from the gas and turn it into a plasma.
###718 The soup of electrons and ions accelerates as it moves through a magnetic field generated
###724 by superconducting magnets. Then itÕs hit with a second blast of radio waves that heats
###731 it up to a million degrees Celsius.
###733 This hot plasma blasts out the back and propels the craft.
###742 As part of their design process, Ben and team are testing some of the specialized components
###749 of their rocket in the harsh environment of space.
###754 A simple frame will carry an array of novel sensors. One holds a colony
###790 of bacteria.
###793 Another is a series of tiny GoPro cameras converted to record the intensity of infrared
###799 and ultraviolet light normally hidden to the human eye.
###805 Argon gas is used to insulate instruments against the cold, with chemical packets added
###812 for warmth.
###816 The frame is stabilized with tiny gyroscopes, and outfitted with GPS devices for tracking.
###828 The idea of using plasma to power rockets is not a new one.
###837 The Polish physicist Stanislav Ulam is said to have been inspired by atom bomb tests in
###843 the 1940s. He speculated that waves of plasma from small nuclear detonations could propel
###852 a spacecraft to extreme speeds.
###859 In the 1950s, that idea animated dreams of exploring the solar system in spacecraft like
###866 this 360-ton Mars-bound vehicle.
###873 The idea gained funding in the Orion project, with the idea of driving a spacecraft with
###879 nuclear pulses and landing on Mars in only a month. Concerns about radioactive exhaust
###888 helped doom the project.
###895 Plasma rockets, energized by nuclear reactions, were revived in the Daedalus and Nerva projects
###901 of the 1960s, and again at the beginning of this century as part of a journey to JupiterÕs
###908 moon Europa. Rising costs killed that mission.
###913 BenÕs efforts rely on simpler, far less expensive methods.
###922 Their payload has flown all night up to an altitude of over 100,000 feet. Then in the
###930 low air pressure, the balloon burst and the payload parachuted to the ground.
###953 They know exactly where it is. But that doesnÕt mean retrieving it will be easy.
###967 It takes nearly all day to travel well-packed trails to a point about seven miles from their
###973 prize. The rest of the way will take them through forests and over hills.
###994 A brave attempt through the deep snow. The team gets to within two miles.
###1017 The next day, a long hike and snow shoes finally gets them to the payload.
###1026 To this team, the effort is worth it, for plasma rockets could finally have their day.
###1046 A real world test, being designed by the private company, Ad Astra, could take place as early
###1053 as 2016.
###1058 It fits a real world need.
###1063 Flying at an altitude of three hundred fifty kilometers, the International Space Station
###1069 whips around the Earth every one and a half hours.
###1075 To stay aloft, it must maintain a speed of 28,000 kilometers per hour. But its solar
###1083 panels and crew modules smack into so many tiny molecules in the upper atmosphere that
###1089 it gradually slows down and loses altitude.
###1094 To stay aloft, the station uses up around 4,000 kilograms of fuel per year. That fuel
###1102 must be flown up from Earth, which in turn reduces the amount of food, water, people,
###1108 and equipment that a resupply mission can deliver.
###1114 The idea is to use a plasma rocket to help boost the station to a higher altitude, powered
###1122 by electricity generated by solar panels aboard the station.
###1129 Ben is also working on lower power rockets for much smaller spacecraft. The idea is to
###1137 mount them on tiny desktop-sized craft called Cube Sats.
###1143 Based on this miniature model, he imagines sending small, solar-powered rockets to remote
###1149 locations in the solar system to collect scientific data, prospect for minerals, or even look
###1156 for evidence of life.
###1160 From there, the idea is to one day scale up the technology to power a human mission to
###1167 Mars.
###1170 After weeks spent accelerating in earth orbit, the rocket would make a break for Mars. Cutting
###1176 flight time from a year to several months would lower costs and crew hazards.
###1183 BenÕs ultimate goal is to help boost a whole new approach to space travel thatÕs now emerging.
###1192 May 2012 marked a major milestone in the rise of free enterprise in space. The SpaceX Company
###1204 successfully docked an unmanned space capsule with the International Space Station. It followed
###1213 that up six months later with the first commercial resupply mission.
###1219 ThatÕs just the beginning. NASA is looking to companies to supply orbital launch services,
###1235 and to be long-term partners in future manned missions beyond the moon.
###1246 Hoping to make big bucks, companies are developing orbital habitats and space planes, laying
###1253 the groundwork for missions geared to mining, exploration, and even tourism.
###1263 To Ben, this new race to space will go to the swift and the innovative.
###1274 Today, because of weather and winds, he and his team have chosen to launch their payload
###1279 from the spectacular Ruth Glacier in Denali National Park.
###1291 Amid the rugged terrain, this immense river of ice sweeps down into a perfect natural
###1297 runway.
###1324 With dusk approaching, balloon and payload are ready.
###1337 The balloon drifts up through the dense polar air.
###1378 With night falling, it rises up to the edge of space.
###1384 Meanwhile, overhead, a solar storm is raging.
###1396 Aboard the International Space Station, astronaut Don Pettit is making observations to complement
###1403 what BenÕs team finds.
###1408 He passes over the Arctic several times during the balloonÕs flight.
###1415 The auroras he photographs are an indicator of the amount of solar particles that will
###1420 pummel BenÕs rocket components.
###1424 This is a time of high solar activity, approaching the peak of an 11-year cycle.
###1431 The Arctic is framed by a ring of dancing lights, by curtains of green and red and blue.
###1438 This university-based experiment operates on the remote edge of modern scienceÉ dominated
###1445 by large international projects such as the Hubble Space Telescope, the International
###1453 Space Station or the Large Hadron Collider.
###1460 And yet, working small, BenÕs team believes they are onto something big. Their goal is
###1473 not only to open new avenues of space exploration, but to actually seize the initiative.
###1481 ItÕs a romantic idea of individuals challenging the odds and striking out to new frontiers.
###1496 With technologies that are getting smaller and more powerful, who will hold back this
###1502 new breed of explorer?
