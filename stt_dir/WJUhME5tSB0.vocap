###0 Speaker: Welcome, everyone.
###1 (applause)
###7 I want to start to frame the day a little bit,
###11 so that you know how we approach this work and how we approach
###17 our partnership with you.
###18 First of all, no one gets anywhere on their own.
###24 We have all had mentors.
###27 And I have been really blessed to have two terrific mentors
###33 in my life among many others.
###36 But two very special ones.
###38 When I was a young college student thinking about going to
###43 law school, I talked my way into a job as a paralegal in this
###48 big law firm in Chicago.
###51 And anyone who was foolish enough to make eye contact with
###55 me, I asked them what they did.
###57 And there was a young attorney who spent some time with me.
###64 And invited me into her office.
###67 Told me what she did for a living.
###70 Gave me an opportunity to ask her some questions.
###74 Basically, she invested in me.
###77 And, and she saw something in me that I didn't see in myself.
###84 She later introduced me to her fiance,
###87 this hot shot young lawyer named Barack Obama.
###94 And I really can say that having known the two of them as
###99 long as I have, I am a better professional, a better husband,
###107 a better father from their example and from
###111 their mentorship.
###112 And so I really try to go out of my way personally to mentor
###119 anyone that I have had the opportunity to do so.
###121 And I am surrounded by people here at the White House who
###127 have the same ethic and who feel the same way.
###131 And at a time of such turmoil, such volatility,
###136 such economic hardship, mentoring is even more
###141 important.
###143 And, and you know that taking a little bit of time in someone's
###147 life, it doesn't just do something for the person
###150 that you have the opportunity to mentor.
###154 It does something for yourself.
###157 Participating in your community, making your community a better
###160 place to live, it helps all of us.
###163 And so we have brought that work into the White House.
###167 We have had a great partnership with you, Big Brothers,
###170 Big Sisters.
###172 We have started our own mentoring program here.
###177 The Boys Mentoring Program about 20 young men,
###182 high school age from the Washington, D.C. area,
###185 that are hooked up with White House staffers as mentors.
###190 They have done amazing things.
###194 20 young women who are from the Washington,
###197 D.C. area participated in the White House Mentoring Program.
###201 I keep hearing from staffers what a great opportunity
###204 it is for them.
###206 Mentor, mentees have got a chance to do a couple
###209 of cool things.
###210 They have visited the Supreme Court.
###211 They have had a chance to visit Air Force One.
###214 They have hung out with Bo.
###216 (laughter)
###217 And they have met the President and the First Lady
###220 of the United States.
###221 We just had a graduation ceremony for those
###223 who graduated.
###224 And for, for the entire program that graduated just
###227 this past weekend.
###228 We are about to bring on another 40 young men and
###232 women into the White House.
###233 So we have, we have done this ourselves because we know what,
###238 what a privilege it is to be here.
###240 And our responsibility to reach out and help others.
###245 And so we have a lot of groups that come into the White House
###251 and sit down, and, and, and talk with us.
###253 And we are going to have a parade of senior officials who
###256 want to come in and meet you and share a little bit
###259 about what we are doing.
###260 Because we know something else.
###263 You all are leaders in your community.
###266 People follow you.
###268 People listen to you.
###270 You have credibility.
###271 And so when you go back home and just,
###274 just tell them a little bit about us.
###275 You know, sometimes people can get a bit cynical
###278 about government.
###279 Tell them what you saw.
###281 Tell them what you learned.
###283 Tell them what you thought was great.
###285 Tell them what you thought was full of beans and all of that.
###288 But just the fact that you are engaging with us
###290 I think is important.
###291 It is important to us.
###293 I hope it is important to you.
###294 And it will be important to, to the people back home.
###299 So with that, I want to turn this over to a, a,
###304 a young attorney, who I first met when he was a college
###309 student at the University of Illinois.
###310 He graduated and went on to the law school,
###314 started his own practice.
###315 He was doing pretty well until I told him,
###317 forget about all of that.
###318 I need you to come to Washington,
###320 D.C. and take a gigantic pay cut.
###322 And, and come work with me.
###325 He is the leader of Disability Outreach.
###329 And the leader of Disability Policy for the Domestic Policy
###333 Council, Kareem Dale.
###335 Thanks, Kareem.
###335 (applause)
###342 I was going to give you a different introduction.
###344 But then I saw you standing there.
###345 So I knew you could hear me.
###347 Thanks, everyone.
###348 See you later.
###349 (applause)
###353 Kareem Dale: All right.
###354 Thanks.
###354 Thanks, Mike.
###355 And welcome to the White House to everybody.
###358 And we are certainly thrilled to have all of you all here.
###361 And for those who may be watching on line on the live
###365 stream, we are certainly pleased to have all of you all watching
###369 on line as well.
###370 So we have a good agenda for you all today.
###373 Hopefully, everybody has picked up the agenda
###376 when you walked in.
###377 I will kind of be back and forth periodically to bridge the gap
###382 between different folks and to give you some additional
###384 information about what we are doing,
###385 things we are doing here at the White House that we think are,
###389 we think was very interesting to you all.
###391 We think it is beneficial for you all to know.
###393 But we also think it is beneficial from our stand point
###397 to make sure that you know what the President is doing,
###399 what the President is up to, what our administration is up
###402 to, and what the White House at large is up to.
###406 So we obviously have coming up next Tina Tchen who is the
###411 First Lady's Chief of Staff.
###412 And Tina will be here in a few minutes.
###415 And then we have George Sheldon from the -- sorry.
###421 Next after Tina is Joshua DuBois.
###424 Who is the head of our faith office and then we also
###428 have George Sheldon.
###429 Then to be concluded by the Attorney General.
###432 So we have a good line-up for you all today.
###435 And so let me just talk about a few things while we wait for
###438 Tina to arrive in the next few minutes.
###441 As Mike said, I have two, two roles here.
###444 Well, actually I have three roles here.
###447 You have three roles plus whatever else might come up
###450 in the interim that the administration,
###453 that the President, or Valerie or anybody else needs you to do.
###456 So we have you know some designed roles,
###458 but we are the jack of all trades,
###460 particularly in the Office of Public Engagement.
###462 So as Mike said, I do Disability Policy in the
###464 Domestic Policy Council.
###466 I also do in the Office of Public Engagement which is
###468 Valerie Jarrett, one of Valerie Jarrett's offices I do outreach
###471 to the disability community.
###473 But I also do outreach to lawyers and the
###476 civil rights community.
###478 I think I got stuck with that.
###479 Actually, Tina is my former boss in the Office of Public
###482 Engagement before she went over to the First Lady's office.
###485 And she is a lawyer from Chicago as well.
###487 And so I think when she saw that I was coming, she just decided,
###490 well, I know you, you are a lawyer from Chicago.
###492 I am a lawyer from Chicago.
###493 So you do lawyers.
###494 So that is, that is how I got stuck with that.
###497 But, but it has been a good gig.
###500 So within the Office of Public Engagement,
###505 we do a number of things.
###507 And we are the front door to the White House.
###510 So it is our job to make sure that you all know what is going
###515 on here at the White House, what the President is up to.
###518 It is our job to make sure that we are communicating to you all
###522 as constituents about things that are important to you,
###525 and to your communities across the country.
###528 It is also our job to listen to you.
###530 And to bring you to events like this and briefings so you can
###534 hear from us, but that also we can hear from you.
###537 And you will, you will have a chance to ask questions to
###540 some of our, some of our briefers today.
###542 We want to have a chance to hear from you.
###545 And to make sure that we understand where you
###547 are coming from.
###548 And this is something that we, we do quite a bit here in the
###551 Office of Public Engagement bringing in constituents really
###554 from around the country, Democrats, Republican,
###556 Independents.
###557 It doesn't matter to us.
###558 We want to hear from all Americans to make sure that that
###561 is, that you all are advising us on what you think our policy
###565 should be related to, to your communities.
###568 And so we have developed a number of different tools
###572 and so that we can do that.
###573 And so that we can hear from you.
###576 And so that we can understand where you are coming from.
###578 But also so that, so that you can hear from us.
###580 Our new director, our new director,
###583 I guess he is no longer new.
###584 I know he has been here for maybe, gosh,
###587 I think John has been here since December or November now.
###590 I lose track.
###591 I have been here since day one, so it,
###594 it gets a little -- things get a little run together.
###596 But john has been here several months,
###598 John Carson is our Director of the Office of Public Engagement
###602 and so he has developed a number of tools for us to communicate
###606 with everybody throughout the country.
###607 And so let me just tell you about -- let me make sure --
###611 Catherine, Tina is not here yet, right?
###614 Catherine?
###615 Catherine: No, she is not.
###617 Kareem Dale: Okay.
###617 All right. She is all right.
###617 While we are, I am going to tell you about a couple of these
###620 tools that I think are beneficial to you all,
###622 that you all should know about.
###624 One of those tools is what is called a
###627 Community Leaders Briefing.
###629 And the Community Leaders Briefing is,
###632 it is actually not that much different than what we are doing
###636 today with you all.
###638 What we do is we bring in leaders,
###640 community leaders from a particular constituency or a
###644 particular place in the country or particular group of people
###647 that are leaders in their local communities.
###650 That are doing great things, that are leading their
###652 communities across the country.
###655 And we bring those community leaders in and we have a
###659 dialogue with White House administration officials.
###662 And while house officials and administration officials from
###666 particular agencies.
###667 So we'll bring in those community or we'll bring in 100
###671 to 150 leaders, they will have a chance to come here and hear
###676 from administration officials which is the part that is very
###678 similar to what we are doing here today.
###681 You will have a chance to hear from,
###683 hear from administration officials in
###685 their relevant areas.
###686 We'll do a briefing.
###687 We'll do that here.
###688 They will have a chance to ask questions and then we'll have
###690 break out sessions in the afternoon where those,
###694 those leaders break up into you know four or five, six,
###698 different break out groups and have a chance to ask questions
###701 of administration officials and really kind of dig down deep
###704 into some of the issues that are concerning them in
###706 their local communities.
###708 And it is just another way for us to reach out to
###710 local communities.
###711 Because, you know, we get kind of tied up here in Washington
###714 and we think the world only exists in Washington.
###717 But we realize we need to be communicating and talking to
###720 communities across the country.
###722 So that is one way that we do that.
###724 So I say that to say that you should go out and check out our
###728 website, the Office of Public Engagement website on the White
###731 House website and you know if you think that there is an
###734 opportunity that community leaders briefing,
###736 that you think oh, these set of or group of persons or a
###742 particular constituency, might be interested in having a
###745 community, community leaders briefing,
###747 then you can email me and we'll, we'll, we'll take a look at it.
###750 And we'll consider it.
###751 And we'll figure out if there is a way to do it.
###755 Obviously, we are doing this already for Big Brothers,
###758 Big Sisters.
###759 So it will be something different.
###760 But that you might be, I am sure you all,
###762 all of you are involved in other organizations and other groups
###764 and things of that nature.
###765 So that is one, one idea.
###767 The second thing, second tool that we have done in order to
###770 highlight people that are doing great things around the country,
###774 we have created Champions Of Change.
###775 Let me ask, how many people have actually heard of community
###779 leaders briefing or Champions Of Change?
###781 Have any of you all heard of that?
###783 If you raise your hands, I am blind,
###784 if you didn't see the cane.
###786 Please don't, don't raise your hand you know.
###788 You all are the ones that look crazy, not me.
###789 (laughter)
###791 Because I know I am blind, so if you all didn't see the cane,
###794 you all want to look like oh, duh, why did I raise my hand?
###798 He can't see me.
###799 So maybe just clap for any of those that have,
###803 that have heard of Community Leaders Briefing or
###805 Champions Of Change.
###806 Okay.
###807 A few of you all.
###808 A few of you all.
###809 All right.
###810 Not nearly enough, though.
###811 So Champions Of Change was something that we developed to
###814 really highlight people that are really doing great
###817 things around the country.
###818 I will give you an example.
###820 We did a Champions Of Change in my disability role.
###822 We did a Champions Of Change for those persons who are doing
###826 great things in STEM, science, technology, engineering,
###829 and math for people with disabilities.
###831 And we had some you know great people.
###833 Actually it was -- we had some really,
###836 really great people and there were stories done.
###840 In various news outlets or really across the country,
###843 a lot of good publicity.
###845 And we highlight generally about 12 to 14 people and we bring
###849 them into the White House, we highlight them,
###851 we do a blog about it, we tweet about it,
###854 and we do a couple of different panel discussions.
###859 We do panel discussions with the different champions to talk
###861 about the issues.
###862 And we invite you know a hundred or so people to come in.
###865 Their guests as well as different people from that
###868 particular community to come in and listen to the
###870 panel discussions.
###871 We also give the champions a tour of the White House,
###874 and it is just a great way to really signal that our,
###879 our belief that it is not only about government.
###882 It is not government alone that is going to make a difference
###885 in our communities, but it is people like you all that
###888 are going to make a difference everyday.
###890 And it is a chance for us to highlight some of those
###892 champions that are really doing phenomenal things.
###895 If you take a look at our Champions website,
###897 you will see we have had champions in business,
###900 in environment.
###901 We have had champions in, in, I think teachers and just all
###906 sorts of different areas where we have had Champions Of Change.
###909 And so if you take a look at that and you think, wow,
###911 I have an idea for a Champions Of Change program.
###914 You know, let us know.
###916 And we will, we will also consider that.
###918 So to really those are two really great tools for
###922 us to get involved.
###923 Let me, let me stop for a second and take a few questions.
###926 If anybody has questions that they would want to ask about,
###929 generally the Office of Public Engagement, the work I do,
###932 while, and then we'll just have, we'll move into Tina as
###935 soon as Tina gets here.
###936 I have some other stuff I am going to download for you all as
###939 the briefing progresses.
###941 So any questions right now?
###945 If you have questions, just you can just shout out.
###948 I don't mind.
###950 Any questions?
###950 Audience Member: Over here. Just quick question.
###953 Big Brothers and Big Sisters is pleased to have
###955 the chance to be here.
###955 Thank you very much for hosting us.
###958 Our local agencies around the country,
###960 are obviously consider themselves and have been for
###964 many years, for decades, leaders in child safety and
###966 in youth outcomes.
###968 One of the things we need in addition to resources
###970 are more volunteers.
###971 And as, through the Office of Public Engagement,
###974 are there ways that the White House can encourage different
###977 constituent groups to come forward and serve as Big
###979 Brothers, Big Sisters around the country?
###981 Kareem Dale: Well, I think, I think what we have tried to do
###984 is while you know it is, it gets a little complicated if you
###988 start talking about you know asking people to volunteer
###990 for specific organizations.
###992 I think what we have tried to do is the President and the First
###995 Lady have really highlighted volunteerism and we have put
###998 a big emphasis on that.
###999 And the main emphasis that has been through,
###1001 is through the Corporation For National Community Service.
###1005 And really encouraging people to get out and volunteer in
###1009 your local communities and organizations that you
###1013 appreciate and that you want to help out.
###1016 Now, obviously Big Brothers, Big Sisters would be one of those
###1018 organizations where folks can volunteer and do mentoring.
###1023 But there are obviously many other organizations as well.
###1026 And so obviously I would, I would encourage I think you all,
###1030 I assume you all probably have a partnership in some capacity
###1033 with Corporation for National Community Service.
###1036 If not, we can certainly help facilitate that,
###1039 additional conversations with the corporation.
###1043 But we, we, we believe as you heard Mike talk about,
###1046 we certainly believe in community service and we are
###1050 pushing individuals to volunteer and get involved in their
###1053 communities because the President and First Lady really
###1057 believe in that as well.
###1059 So we'll, you know, we can certainly work on that.
###1062 Yup.
###1064 Other questions at this point?
###1067 Okay.
###1068 All right.
###1069 So let's, we'll give me a couple of minutes and we'll
###1072 wait for Tina to arrive.
###1074 Oh, Tina is here.
###1076 Perfect timing.
###1077 Perfect timing.
###1078 You know, they have been raising their hands and I told them I
###1082 couldn't see them, Tina.
###1084 Right at home.
###1084 So you heard me talk a little bit about Tina earlier.
###1089 So without further adieu, the First Lady's Chief Of Staff and
###1092 my former boss, Tina Tchen.
###1094 (applause)
###1103 Tina Tchen: Thank you, Kareem.
###1105 Kareem is you have already seen sort of one of our best
###1110 spokespersons and role models and is just out you know on all
###1115 sorts of issues.
###1116 So he has been such a terrific leader around the country.
###1119 And for young people.
###1121 I am delighted to be here.
###1123 I actually wear two hats here at the White House.
###1125 I am Mrs. Obama's Chief Of Staff.
###1128 And after having served the first two years of the
###1130 administration as the Director of the Office Of Public
###1132 engagement, so that in former capacity,
###1135 I spent a lot of time with Big Brothers Big Sisters as part of
###1138 our outreach efforts.
###1139 So I am a great admirer of the all of the work
###1141 that all of you do.
###1143 My second hat is I am also the Executive Director of the White
###1146 House Council on Women and Girls which is chaired by
###1149 Valerie Jarrett.
###1150 And it is our council consisting all of the agencies in the
###1153 federal government and all of the major White House offices.
###1157 That really promotes pursuant to the President's directive in the
###1160 executive order that he signed when he created the council back
###1165 in March of '09 to make sure that every part of the federal
###1168 government pays attention to the needs of women and girls in
###1171 everything that we do.
###1173 And, certainly, making sure that young women and girls really
###1178 reach their full potential in things like STEM education,
###1182 in leadership capacities, in much of what we all of you do I
###1186 know as, as mentors is part of our mission here and what we do.
###1192 For the First Lady's office, as many of you know from her own
###1195 personal history, mentorship is a concept that she feels
###1201 quite strongly about.
###1203 Very often times when she speaks to young people,
###1206 not just here in the United States,
###1208 but a key part of many of her foreign speeches when she,
###1212 whether it is in Brazil or in India or more recently last
###1217 summer in South Africa she talks to young people about her own
###1222 personal narrative and about how, you know,
###1226 you can be anything you want to be and how her own life
###1230 story demonstrates that.
###1231 And the importance then of paying it forward and
###1235 of mentorship.
###1236 Her own personal story as you all know, one where she after,
###1241 you know, graduating from Princeton, Harvard Law School,
###1243 going to work at Sidley Austin a big national law firm based in
###1248 Chicago, then made the decision to leave that and you know to
###1253 work both in city government, but importantly to work for
###1256 public allies.
###1258 To really be at the ground level of that organization that really
###1262 promotes young adults working in inner cities and on programs and
###1268 with disconnected youth and providing that kind of up growth
###1271 and mentorship.
###1272 And she has seen herself very much as a mentor to many of
###1275 those public allies folks.
###1278 And I now see it as we travel around the country,
###1281 more often than not when we are in a,
###1282 in an event and holding some sort of grass roots rally or
###1286 something else, people will come up having been high school
###1289 students that she mentored or college students who are now
###1292 people who are administrators or executives or work
###1294 for state government.
###1296 And we have tried to replicate and model mentorship
###1299 here at the White House.
###1301 So from early on as many of you may know, we have had the,
###1304 the First Lady started a White House Mentorship Program.
###1307 We will in fact tomorrow hold a graduation ceremony for our
###1311 second group of graduates who will be graduating
###1313 from high school.
###1315 We, we started it when we first got here and had a group of,
###1318 of at that point, sophomores and juniors.
###1321 And we graduated that first group that became
###1324 seniors last year.
###1325 And our second group this year, and we have had a
###1327 new group come in.
###1328 And this year, we had one for the girls,
###1331 because we organized that from the East Wing.
###1333 This year, we told the West Wing we'll let the boys come in
###1336 too and be part of the graduation ceremony.
###1338 The President runs, his staff runs a mentorship program for
###1342 boys as well.
###1344 And it is, it has been terrific.
###1346 It has been a labor of love for many of us here
###1347 in the White House.
###1349 The mentors are a collection of White House staffers.
###1353 And we also do then organize group events for all of them.
###1357 We have had great participation from places like George
###1360 Washington University who has sent over many of their staff to
###1364 do Saturday morning writing seminars for these kids and
###1367 career counseling.
###1368 And, you know, we have been able to take them on visits to Air
###1372 Force One and to, to the Capitol building.
###1375 And every year they come with us to the Women Of Courage Awards
###1378 event that Secretary Clinton gives, gives out.
###1382 We have been able to give them previews of State Dinners.
###1384 So it has been, I hope exciting for them.
###1387 It has been tremendously rewarding for all of us.
###1390 Because as -- I don't have to tell all of you, you know,
###1394 mentorship is a two way street.
###1395 You know, you get as much out of it as a mentor as you give and
###1400 put in for these young people.
###1402 So that has been you know really a constant theme that I think
###1405 the President and the First Lady have promoted as part of their
###1409 overall message in support of public service as a whole.
###1414 It is a theme that carried through the recent report of
###1417 the Commission On Community Solutions that just finished
###1420 it's work last week and submitted a report to the
###1422 President on recommendations for carrying the work forward to
###1427 stay involved with disconnected youth.
###1430 You know, especially our older youth who are not in school,
###1433 not employed, and how we, we reach those kids.
###1437 And in our work that we recently did in Chicago,
###1441 when we hosted the NATO Summit there about three weeks ago and
###1446 what the First Lady was able to do.
###1447 Every part of the summit has a spousal program where the
###1450 spouses of the visiting leaders participate in
###1454 a separate program.
###1455 And what we were able to do for that event was to take those
###1460 spouses to the Gary Comer Youth Center which is a youth center
###1463 that Gary Comer, the founder of Lands End,
###1468 created in his old neighborhood on the south side of Chicago
###1472 which is just a few blocks from where the First Lady grew up.
###1475 And it is now a full service center for youth both after
###1478 school and before school and they started a
###1480 charter high school.
###1482 And really it is an embodiment of how people in our community
###1486 can be engaged with youth.
###1488 And we were able to show that to the NATO leader spouses.
###1492 The First Lady of Norway who is quite an expert in these having
###1497 been to several summits actually told me it was the best spousal
###1500 program they had ever had.
###1502 Because they are used to seeing a lot of museums and lovely
###1504 places that are shown off usually by, by Heads Of State.
###1509 They don't often get to see actually really having an
###1512 engagement with the community.
###1513 And it is, it is a terrific center and the kids were really
###1517 our tour directors you know all throughout,
###1519 who were terrific spokes people.
###1521 And real examples of what mentorship and what you all do
###1525 with Big Brothers and Big Sisters.
###1527 The kinds of molding of young lives that you,
###1531 you all do everyday.
###1532 So my message is I guess you know just really very
###1535 brief and two fold.
###1536 And that is to thank you for the work that I know all of
###1540 you do across the country everyday with your mentors,
###1546 supporting them and recruiting them with your mentees.
###1549 Supporting them in their lives.
###1551 And to make sure that you know that you have great supporters
###1556 and partners in both the East Wing and the West Wing of
###1559 the White House.
###1560 And really people throughout the administration who know
###1563 what important work it is that you do,
###1567 who are great supporters of the work that you do.
###1570 And that, you know, we look forward to continuing to expand
###1573 that work and to figure out ways on which we can you know,
###1577 send along and continue to promote the message of
###1579 mentorship throughout everything that we do.
###1583 So thank you again.
###1584 With that, I am, you know, I can take a couple of questions if
###1588 people have got some.
###1589 Yes.
###1589 Paul Bliss: Yes, I am Paul bliss,
###1591 CEO of Big Brothers Big Sisters in Washington, D.C.
###1595 and we have had the privilege of hosting the Obama
###1598 family for approximately two hours painting the school
###1602 for Martin Luther King Day.
###1604 And I know there is an awful lot of Big Brother,
###1607 Big Sister agencies across the country that would love to
###1610 be able to host the President or the First Lady.
###1615 How would they go about doing that?
###1617 Obviously, there is re-elections and there is traveling
###1621 throughout the country.
###1623 I am certain that there would be opportunities for us
###1626 to host the First Family.
###1630 Tina Tchen: Well, and we have had a wonderful time here in,
###1634 in the DC community.
###1636 Sure.
###1637 It is -- travel is always a little challenging.
###1639 It is going to be particularly challenging this year with the
###1641 remaining 149 days I gather that there are now between now and
###1646 Novemeber 6 just to pick a day off the calendar.
###1652 But, you know, we are certainly you know in -- and Kareem you
###1655 know can be your contact at public engagement if there are
###1659 particular invites that you all have or
###1660 particular ideas for things.
###1664 Feel free to send them in and send them along you know through
###1667 Kareem and his team and they will get them over to us to,
###1670 to consider.
###1671 You know, we are happy, happy to consider those.
###1674 But I will beg your indulgence and your patience as we
###1679 work our ways through what are, what are lots of requests.
###1683 But as I said, these are, these are important issues to the
###1686 President and First Lady, so we welcome any ideas.
###1691 Speaker: Hi Tina.
###1691 Remember me.
###1692 Tina Tchen: I do.
###1693 Speaker: How are you?
###1695 Tina Tchen: Okay. How are you?
###1696 Speaker: We spent many years together in Chicago at the
###1698 Department of Children and Family Services and we won't
###1700 talk about that anymore.
###1702 (laughter)
###1703 It is one, it is just great to see you.
###1706 And the second thing is connecting with your office and
###1710 helping Big Brothers, Big Sisters expose more of the
###1714 work that it is doing.
###1715 Particularly, I was very interested in what Kareem
###1718 talked about, highlighting some of the matches,
###1724 the longevity of those matches.
###1726 We just had a match that lasted four children had 24 years of
###1730 mentoring from us.
###1732 All four went to college.
###1733 Two have graduated and two are on their way to graduating.
###1737 That is the kind of community story I would like to see on
###1739 the website or some way that we can do that.
###1742 So if you don't mind, may I call you?
###1744 Tina Tchen: Of course, you can do that.
###1746 And Kareem really is, you know, we rely on him
###1750 also as a contact.
###1751 But, you know, he can get you through to me.
###1756 And, and I think, you know, trying to really pass that word
###1760 along and highlight stories.
###1762 We are always looking for, you know,
###1764 we call them real person stories.
###1767 But those, those things that really convey.
###1770 You know, we have found telling an individual's story is
###1773 sometimes you know, the most powerful thing.
###1775 You know, I should mention one of the things I wanted in
###1777 particular to mention from the First Lady's office that we have
###1780 spent the last year working on and I know I think many of
###1783 your chapters have as well, and that is our
###1786 Joining Forces Initiative.
###1787 So a year ago April the First Lady started the second
###1791 of her initiatives.
###1792 The first one is our Let's Move Initiative on childhood obesity.
###1794 But the second one is Joining Forces which really works to
###1798 address the issues concerning our military families,
###1801 our veterans, our active duty reserve, our military families.
###1807 And in particular not just the service member themselves,
###1810 but also their spouse and their children.
###1813 And this is something the First Lady you know really learned
###1816 about on the campaign trail in talking to many of these
###1819 spouses and realizing the tremendous challenges that
###1823 these families have.
###1825 They have you know after ten years of war with an all
###1827 volunteer force, we really have one percent of the country that
###1831 is serving to protect the 99 percent of us.
###1834 And I count myself in that 99 percent,
###1836 not coming from a military family.
###1838 But I have now had the privilege of meeting
###1839 these incredible families.
###1841 These are folks whose kids, you know,
###1843 probably went to ten schools before they graduated high
###1846 school, because their parent is deployed and
###1848 moved so many times.
###1850 They are families who have endured having their military
###1854 family members sometimes it is actually both parents, you know,
###1858 serve multiple deployments.
###1859 You know, not just you once.
###1861 Usually two, three, four, five, six times deployed
###1864 into a war zone.
###1866 And these are kids who are incredibly resilient and like
###1871 their families are pretty stoic and incredibly patriotic.
###1876 But kids who really deserve our help.
###1880 And you know, I know, you know mentoring and providing you know
###1884 that kind of guidance that you all do so well for our military
###1887 kids, would be, you know, a terrific service.
###1890 And it is not just the kids who are near a military base because
###1893 in many ways those communities are pretty visible and
###1896 have stepped up.
###1898 Our reserves in Illinois, you know,
###1900 we really have Illinois guard units that have deployed.
###1903 And then those, those, those folks are spread out to our
###1906 communities.
###1907 They are not near a base.
###1908 So you may have a kid you know who is the only kid in their
###1911 school who is going through a deployment.
###1914 And finding those kids and finding ways to connect and
###1918 support those kids is something that we,
###1921 is I think a really important service.
###1923 And something that you all can uniquely provide to them.
###1929 Okay.
###1931 One more.
###1932 No.
###1933 No more.
###1933 I think we answered it all.
###1934 Well, thank you again for all of the work that you do.
###1936 Oh, wait one more.
###1938 Speaker: Can you comment on how you think Big Brothers,
###1939 Big Sisters could be relevant in helping the Council
###1944 On Women And Girls?
###1945 Tina Tchen: Well, absolutely.
###1947 You know, we would, you know, again I think that what you do,
###1950 you know mentorship and providing role models for young
###1953 girls is, is very important.
###1956 And one area that we have been able to spend a lot of time on
###1959 here, at the White House and through the council has been in
###1962 the area of STEM education.
###1963 In fact, I just came from a, from a bilateral session this
###1965 morning with a delegation from India where we were trying to
###1969 find ways to support women and girls in the science,
###1972 technology, engineering, and math fields.
###1974 But we have tried to do that across the board.
###1976 We know that we lose starting after the 4th grade,
###1980 girls where they are, girls and boys interest are about the same
###1983 in math and science, that it starts to fall off pretty
###1986 precipitously, you know, past that point.
###1988 And these are the jobs of the future.
###1990 Even though women are half of the work force,
###1992 they are only 25 percent of the careers in the STEM fields.
###1995 And we are not only losing our girls and our girls are losing
###2000 the ability to access those careers,
###2003 which are both where the jobs are going to be and the economy
###2006 of the future and where the higher paying jobs
###2009 are going to be.
###2010 We as a country are losing out on that talent.
###2013 And so getting, you know, doing, providing mentorship at a young
###2016 age for these young girls is going to be pretty key.
###2020 So recruiting, we have tried to actually tap into our federal
###2024 scientists in our work force to provide that mentorship
###2027 opportunity.
###2028 I think Big Brothers and Big Sisters could do that as well.
###2031 But that is not just in the STEM area.
###2033 We have the next area we would like to do more in,
###2036 I will you know, be quite candid to say we haven't spend enough
###2039 time on but would like to do some more on is the more general
###2042 area of girl's self esteem.
###2046 I mean I think building the self esteem of our young girls and
###2051 women and I say this as the mom of a 15 year old daughter,
###2054 is so important with all of the other counter messaging
###2056 that they are exposed to that is out there.
###2059 Again, I think mentors provide that sounding board,
###2064 an alternative role model, an alternative ear and support to
###2069 these young girls who are fighting against a lot of
###2073 cultural messaging that is different.
###2075 And in many cases, you know, even worse kinds of
###2078 vulnerabilities and dangers, whether it is dangers at home,
###2081 and vulnerabilities at home, or externally.
###2084 And I think making sure that we are connected to
###2088 those young girls.
###2089 And we would welcome you know greater partnership.
###2093 We have a Deputy Director Avra Siegel who works with me and
###2096 Haley Schneier (phonetic)
###2097 who is one of Kareem's colleagues in the Office of
###2099 Public Engagement who is devoted to women and girls outreach.
###2103 And again Kareem can get you in touch you know with a more
###2105 specifically if there is specific things that you want
###2108 to connect with the Council on Women and Girls on.
###2110 We would again welcome that as well.
###2112 So again, thank you.
###2113 We hope you enjoyed your day at the White House and we thank you
###2115 again for all of the work that you do everyday.
###2118 (applause)
###2129 Kareem Dale: All right.
###2130 Thank you very much, Tina.
###2132 It is always, you know, there is,
###2135 there is a few of us around here that have been around
###2137 here since day one.
###2139 And go back to the transition.
###2140 Tina is one of those, one of my colleagues here who we came in
###2145 on day one, when it was a little -- you know,
###2149 we didn't quite know where all of the bathrooms were and where
###2151 everything was going on.
###2153 So we spent a long time here and it has been a great journey.
###2158 So while we wait for Joshua, a couple of
###2161 other things I want to do.
###2164 The first thing is when we, you know, we talk about, you hear,
###2167 you have heard Tina and you heard Mike say it, if you,
###2170 questions you have about participating in events or
###2173 getting in contact with Tina or the Council for Women and Girls,
###2176 we actually, we are very serious about that.
###2178 So if you do want to make those connections,
###2181 I am happy to help make those connections.
###2183 Particularly because it won't go,
###2184 it won't be me having to do the work.
###2185 I will be able to put it off on my colleagues.
###2187 I am always happy to give my colleagues more work.
###2190 And so but if you, if you make that contact,
###2194 Kelly your government relations person has my email address
###2198 and contact information.
###2199 Kelly, you are free to give it to any of these folks and
###2201 we will make those connections with you.
###2204 And that reminds me, I want to thank Kelly for all of her work
###2208 in getting this done.
###2210 She did a phenomenal job, and --
###2212 (applause)
###2216 -- believe you me, doing something here at the White
###2219 House like this, we put a lot of demands on her to get us all of
###2223 the information, get it right, get it by a specific time,
###2227 and this, that, and the other.
###2228 So she did a great job.
###2229 So we appreciate all of her efforts in making the
###2232 event easy for us.
###2236 Is Joshua here?
###2238 He usually just like yells out at me or something crazy.
###2241 So, so just if you have, if you really do want to connect,
###2246 you know, I will second what Tina said about the young man
###2250 who asked about the events, I mean the schedule is incredibly
###2252 tight for the President and the First Lady.
###2254 So it is very difficult.
###2255 And a lot of times it is maybe we get an opportunity for some
###2258 sort of off the record thing at the last minute.
###2261 But it is incredibly difficult to get things on the schedule.
###2264 So just bear with us and keep that in mind.
###2267 But the First Lady's office is really great about connecting
###2271 particularly about her core initiatives,
###2273 whether it be Joining Forces, or Childhood Obesity, Let's Move,
###2279 those are her two core initiatives.
###2281 The Council on Women and Girls would go through the two young
###2284 ladies that Tina mentioned.
###2286 So I am happy to make those connections and our team is
###2289 always looking for really great opportunities.
###2291 So I have more to say to you.
###2292 But I don't want Joshua yelling at me.
###2295 So without further adieu, let me introduce you to the head of our
###2299 faith based office and another one of my colleagues that has
###2302 been here since day one.
###2303 And is a long time friend and worked for the President's
###2306 Senate office as well.
###2308 Joshua DuBois.
###2310 (applause)
###2312 Joshua DuBois: Thank you.
###2312 I appreciate it.
###2315 Good afternoon everyone.
###2316 Audience: Good afternoon.
###2317 Joshua DuBois: It is such a pleasure to be here and to bring
###2318 you greetings on behalf the President and the
###2321 entire White House.
###2322 And also on behalf of a fellow Big Brother myself.
###2326 (applause)
###2330 This is my crowd here.
###2331 I, I was, when I was walking over here and I was recalling
###2335 the first moment that I met my little, I was at the top floor.
###2339 Anybody been to Big Brothers of Mass Bay by any chance?
###2342 There we go.
###2343 Hi, guys.
###2345 So any way, and it is in a high-rise building.
###2347 At least it was at the time.
###2349 We were in this conference room on the top floor.
###2351 And the dread and fear that filled my soul when I thought
###2355 about the, this responsibility that I was entering into.
###2359 And then I saw this little kid with these huge eyes looking up
###2362 at me, and I had no idea what I was going to do.
###2365 But I knew it was going to be a good thing.
###2367 And that was, gosh, 13 or 14 years ago.
###2370 We have been hanging out ever since.
###2372 (applause)
###2373 Thank you.
###2376 I, I knew it was much more than you know just kind of a
###2380 programmatic connection when he went on his Facebook page and,
###2383 you know, you add your siblings on there.
###2385 And he added me as a brother onto his, to his Facebook page.
###2389 And I almost got emotional when I saw that, that happen.
###2393 So Adid, he is now, he was a wonderful kid then,
###2397 facing a number of challenges in his life.
###2399 His father was incarcerated.
###2399 But I am happy to say he just find up his freshman year
###2401 at Morehouse College.
###2402 And so we are delighted by his progress.
###2406 (applause)
###2407 And it's just a wonderful example of what you all do
###2410 every single day.
###2412 And it's the small things that matter.
###2414 It's the Match Support folks reaching out to us and making
###2416 sure things are on track, even when we ignore them,
###2419 and I'm sorry, guys.
###2420 (laughter)
###2423 I was quite delinquent.
###2424 But I was still, Adid and I were still connecting.
###2426 But it took me a couple weeks to return phone calls.
###2429 But -- or, you know, the opportunities that we went to
###2432 baseball games at Fenway and ice skating and all sorts of things.
###2436 You know, years later these stick with us and they matter.
###2440 And, you know, Adid, I'm positive,
###2442 is going to be a future leader in this country.
###2445 He is going to finish up at Morehouse and maybe run for
###2448 office or impact kids in other ways.
###2450 And I was excited to talk to him a couple weeks ago and he said
###2454 he's going to reach out to his own local Big Brothers,
###2456 and when the time is right become a Big Brother himself.
###2459 And so you know that your work matters,
###2461 but on behalf of the President I want to affirm that it matters
###2464 so much for so many young men and women all around,
###2467 all across our country.
###2469 So I lead the Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood
###2471 Partnerships, and my job is to work through our offices at 13
###2475 federal agencies to connect the Administration to local
###2478 nonprofits, both faith-based and secular.
###2481 For example, we have an office at the Department of Labor that
###2484 works with local congregations and nonprofits on job training
###2487 programs, getting them set up and running.
###2488 We have an office at the Department of Agriculture that
###2492 works on food and nutrition issues with local congregations
###2495 and nonprofits at the Department of Justice and Education,
###2497 and on, and on.
###2499 We've managed the government's relationship with local groups
###2501 around the country.
###2502 And we're also one of several advocates for mentoring
###2505 in the Administration.
###2507 I have been particularly pleased to work with my colleagues at
###2510 the Department of Justice on making sure that the funding
###2513 for mentoring programs like Big Brothers continues and
###2516 strengthens in some ways.
###2518 I was very delighted last year we were able to support,
###2520 in somewhat of a new way, mentoring of juvenile offenders
###2528 to the tune of about $13 million in an impactful way.
###2531 Thank you.
###2532 (applause)
###2533 And what we're trying to do is kind of weave mentoring into
###2537 federal programs that may be distinct from mentoring.
###2539 For example, workforce development, you know, well,
###2541 if you're thinking about, you know,
###2543 how to make sure that young people are connected to jobs,
###2547 well, one thing they need is a good mentor in their life that
###2549 reminds them about, you know, the importance of going to
###2553 work and finding employment.
###2555 If you're looking at ex-offender reentry, which we talked about,
###2559 or substance abuse, well, one thing that would be great for
###2562 folks who are receiving counseling and support for
###2564 substance problems is to have a mentor that comes alongside them
###2567 and supports them as well.
###2568 So we're trying to cross-pollinate mentoring
###2570 across other federal programs and federal agencies,
###2574 and our office does a lot of that work advocating for
###2577 mentoring across the Administration.
###2579 We are open to new ideas.
###2581 For example, we've been participating in some
###2583 conversations recently about how in light of the cuts to
###2587 the Mentoring Children of Prisoners program,
###2589 how potentially the Department of Justice can partner with
###2591 HHS to support some of that good work.
###2593 If there are other ideas, in fact I was talking with one of
###2596 our other mentoring leads at DOJ on the way over here,
###2599 we want to hear from you.
###2601 We don't want this to be a one-way conversation.
###2604 There's a lot going on at any given moment.
###2605 I have 13 agency offices I'm running,
###2608 and other folks are doing a lot of work,
###2609 and so don't assume that we have all the ideas and info we need
###2614 to support mentoring.
###2615 We don't, we need your feedback.
###2617 We need to be in conversation and dialogue with you.
###2620 I'll give everyone my e-mail address so we can keep the
###2621 conversation going from here.
###2624 For any tweeters in the room, any folks on Twitter in here?
###2626 I'm also @JoshuaDuBois as well.
###2629 And I respond to those frequently.
###2632 My e-mail address is JDuBois, J-D-U-B-O-I-S @WHO.EOP.gov.
###2647 I'll give that again.
###2647 J DuBois, JDUBOIS at WHO, as in White House Office,
###2653 EOP, Executive Office of the President, .gov.
###2657 And I'd love to continue the conversation with you all.
###2659 But, you know, most importantly, thank you for
###2661 all the good work you do.
###2662 I am just one of thousands of Big Brothers and Big Sisters
###2665 who's deeply appreciative of this wonderful organization.
###2669 You're changing lives every single day.
###2671 People say that a lot, but, you know,
###2673 I've seen it in my own life and in Adid's life as well,
###2676 and on behalf of the President I want to appreciate
###2677 your good work.
###2679 Thank you all so much.
###2679 (applause)
###2682 Thank you.
###2695 Kareem Dale: All right.
###2697 Thank you very much to Joshua.
###2698 So our next speaker, as you see from your agenda,
###2703 is from Department of Health and Human Services Administration on
###2706 Children and Families.
###2708 Please give a warm welcome to George Sheldon.
###2711 (applause)
###2717 George Sheldon: Thank you.
###2718 Welcome.
###2719 Do we have any Floridians here?
###2721 (cheering)
###2722 All right.
###2723 I just want to make sure.
###2724 I've only been with the federal government for
###2726 the last 12 months.
###2728 I had this nice, quiet job in Florida running the Florida
###2731 Department of Children and Families,
###2733 and so they decided to open me up to the federal government,
###2737 and I'm really trying to learn how this process works.
###2741 My Deputy in Florida when I came here said that
###2744 Washington is 76 square miles surrounded by reality.
###2749 (laughter)
###2750 But I -- and I think that Joshua made this point -- is that all
###2755 knowledge doesn't reside here, it really is out in the
###2757 communities, and I've learned that so much.
###2760 I would also say that there have been better times to be the
###2764 Assistant Secretary of the Administration for
###2766 Children and Families.
###2768 I would love to have been Assistant Secretary in the '90s,
###2771 when the federal government was flush with dollars and we were
###2774 expanding, but these are different times.
###2777 I mean, you know that.
###2780 You've seen the recent poverty numbers among children,
###2783 one in every five children in this country live in poverty.
###2788 It's even worse for African Americans, about 38 percent,
###2791 35 percent for Hispanics.
###2794 It's upwards to almost 50 percent with children
###2798 who are growing up in single-parent families.
###2801 And that's four times the rate of poverty among kids in
###2807 two-parent families.
###2809 And so children are much more at risk today than
###2813 probably ever before.
###2814 And a lot of things add to that.
###2816 I was in San Diego just this last Thursday,
###2821 and met with the Federal Task Force on Human Trafficking at
###2828 the high school, Glenmont Unified School District,
###2834 and came, you know, stark in the face of active recruiting in
###2843 that high school and other high schools for children
###2847 to be trafficked.
###2849 It is a whole new phenomenon, and these are children who are
###2854 disaffected, who may not have the best of all home life.
###2860 And that's, and that combined with everything is a real,
###2863 is the reason the partnerships with entities like Big Brothers
###2868 and Big Sisters is so important.
###2870 And I'm not saying that, that's a reality.
###2873 When I first got to the Department in Florida,
###2876 I sat down with about 15 young kids who aged out of foster
###2881 care, and these were kids in their, you know, 20, 21, 25.
###2886 And, you know, it was one of those kind of things you do when
###2889 you just become an agency head and you think, well,
###2891 I've got to go by this, so I'll spend about 20 minutes,
###2894 make a few comments.
###2896 Well, two and a half hours later,
###2899 I think I learned more from those 15 kids about foster care
###2902 than I ever learned from all the professionals.
###2904 And I'm not taking anything away from professionals.
###2907 But we designed really a whole child welfare system in this
###2910 country, and we never talked to the kids.
###2912 (applause)
###2917 And I think that's, I mean, I think that's so -- what I
###2918 learned from those kids was almost to a child they said I
###2924 would have rather stayed at home and dealt with some of the
###2927 issues out of my home than to go in to a child welfare system
###2931 where I was passed from home to home, school to school.
###2935 And I don't care if you're in ten good foster homes,
###2943 that if you're in that many homes,
###2945 you begin to believe as a child you don't belong anywhere.
###2949 And that is so important, that is the reason that mentors are
###2953 so important.
###2954 Whether a brother figure or sister figure or father figure
###2958 or mother figure is so important to these kids,
###2961 whether it's children in the child welfare system,
###2964 those children who are susceptible to human trafficking
###2968 in Glenmont High School, it is so important to
###2972 have that connection.
###2974 The other thing I learned from those kids was how important one
###2977 human being was in their life.
###2978 It may have been another foster child,
###2983 it may have been a foster parent,
###2984 it may have been their caseworker,
###2986 but in many cases it was a mentor.
###2988 Somebody who took the time to do something with them that they
###2993 looked for every week.
###2994 The third thing I really learned is how important being normal is
###3000 to them and doing normal things.
###3003 And if you look at child welfare systems,
###3006 they're really designed to be risk adverse.
###3008 You know, let's not allow something to happen because
###3012 we're going to be sued as a result of it.
###3016 So we, you know, when I was -- I was speaking to a group of
###3020 foster parents in Clearwater, actually,
###3023 and afterwards some of these foster parents came over to me
###3027 and said that we had a dangerous activity czar in the department.
###3032 I said no, we don't.
###3034 (laughter)
###3035 She said, yes, you do.
###3036 Well, we did.
###3037 We had the this woman who approved what foster
###3040 children could do.
###3043 Well, you can be part of Boy Scouts,
###3045 but you can't participate in archery.
###3048 I mean, I'm serious about this.
###3050 And so I basically said, you know,
###3054 you can do something else in the department,
###3055 and we created what we call --
###3057 (laughter)
###3059 We created what I called a normalcy czar.
###3062 Because that's what kids want to be.
###3065 They want to go, they don't want the latest Wii game or iPad,
###3070 most of them want to go to the prom or they want
###3074 to learn how to drive.
###3075 Ninety percent of the kids in the foster care system age out
###3077 without a driver's license.
###3079 My god daughter, when she was old enough to get her learner's
###3083 permit, she had dad up at 7:00 a.m.
###3087 You know what I'm talking about.
###3089 We also use all these nonnormal words at child welfare.
###3093 You know, foster kids are in multiple placements.
###3099 Regular kids grow up in several different homes.
###3101 You know, foster parents need respite care.
###3105 Regular parents need a vacation.
###3107 (laughter)
###3108 I mean, it's, and I think it's a mindset we really kind of have
###3112 to get out to.
###3114 The -- but I do think that I've been mentoring a young man
###3116 for several years, and I just got an opportunity,
###3126 he was in foster care for 11 years,
###3128 and I just had an opportunity to robe him at his
###3133 graduation from law school.
###3135 (applause)
###3136 Which is -- and, because a lot of these kids who have,
###3143 who are disaffected, who have, whether it's foster care or
###3147 whether it's poverty or whether -- these are good kids.
###3152 And generally pretty bright if they're given that opportunity
###3157 to dream and to think beyond themselves.
###3159 And I think that's the reason the partnerships -- I will tell
###3163 you that having been now at state government now in the
###3166 federal government, government cannot do it all.
###3170 We can provide some resources, and that's becoming
###3174 more and more limited.
###3175 We can provide some overall direction,
###3177 but in reality communities have to take it upon themselves.
###3180 And that's the reason that I think Big brothers Big Sisters
###3184 are so important.
###3185 I'm also a strong proponent of Best Buddies,
###3188 because I think they've had this issue working with kids with
###3193 disabilities.
###3194 So the extent to which we can work with you,
###3197 I know that these are particularly tough times to get
###3200 in the door of a state agency, with the limited budgets that
###3204 they are constricting, but we have sent out,
###3210 with my counterpart at the Department of Labor,
###3213 a letter to commissioners around the country pointing out the use
###3219 of TANF funds and that TANF in use for summer jobs for young
###3225 kids is an allowable expense to count against their
###3228 maintenance of effort.
###3229 And that they really ought to be thinking in those terms.
###3232 I think when you're trying to access those kind of supports
###3236 from government, it is important to be a little
###3239 innovative in doing that.
###3242 So I just wanted to take a few minutes and come by.
###3246 I don't want to take up too much of your time,
###3248 but I appreciate what you do.
###3250 I'm coming back to Florida for a day this week, actually.
###3253 I miss Florida, but I like the rest of the 49 states as well.
###3260 (laughter)
###3261 This is a big country.
###3262 I'd be happy to take a question or two if I have the
###3266 authorization to do that.
###3269 Yes, ma'am.
###3269 Audience member: Most TANF funds are directed to states.
###3274 How can you help us or help the states understand that TANF
###3278 funds can be used quite appropriately by an organization
###3283 such as Big Brothers Big Sisters?
###3285 They really do fit the category of many of the children --
###3290 George Sheldon: They do.
###3291 And some that -- are there other Big Brothers Big Sisters around
###3294 the country who have access to TANF funds?
###3297 It really, to what states are you from?
###3300 Audience member: I'm from Pennsylvania.
###3302 Audience member: Mississippi.
###3302 Audience member: I'm from Minnesota.
###3303 Audience member: Texas.
###3304 George Sheldon: Has Minnesota accessed --
###3307 Audience member: We just accessed TANF funds this year.
###3311 George Sheldon: The letter that we sent out -- and I'll
###3313 take another look at it in terms of guidance to state agencies --
###3317 with Labor, was really focused on summer jobs,
###3323 but it was also articulating using local community
###3328 agencies to do that.
###3330 But let me do that, we've had the same issue with states with
###3334 Boys Clubs Girls Clubs, who have also attempted to access TANF.
###3339 I would also point out that TANF used to be almost two-thirds
###3344 direct cash assistance, and it's now reversed.
###3348 And I believe in flexibility for the states.
###3353 I mean, coming from the State, I believe in that.
###3356 But the extent to which we can give greater guidance,
###3359 I clearly am willing to do that.
###3362 I think they've got to be innovative with it.
###3363 I also think you all have to be aggressive, because, you know,
###3367 because they get a lot of asks.
###3370 Yes, sir.
###3371 Audience member: Thank you for pointing out the poverty
###3374 statistics, that 50 percent of children with single-parent
###3377 families are living in poverty.
###3380 Over 80 percent of the over 200,000
###3382 children in Big Brothers Big Sisters are from single-parent
###3385 families.
###3386 So we are in that sweet spot.
###3390 In terms of working together, Big Brothers Big Sisters
###3394 relative to many other mentoring organizations and youth serving
###3398 organizations has a tremendous capacity.
###3400 It's been doing research on youth outcomes,
###3402 continuous research for quality improvement on match strength
###3405 and match length, and we'd like to continue to share that with
###3408 the Department of Health and Human Services.
###3410 It may help you all as you're informed,
###3412 and inform you as you're designing and
###3414 developing programs.
###3416 George Sheldon: I would be very interested in that because,
###3418 you know, this Administration has put a heavy emphasis on
###3421 evidence-based research, and a lot of what we're doing,
###3424 particularly in the child welfare area,
###3426 is now real evidence-based practices.
###3430 We've made a major commitment to trying to deal with trauma
###3437 as an underlying element in child welfare,
###3440 and I think that same thing is true with a lot of the kids
###3444 who grew up in poverty, is the, you know,
###3447 there are some who call it toxic stress,
###3449 and that toxic stress has a long-term impact on the
###3453 development of that child.
###3456 So any research you can share with us,
###3459 I would be very interested in.
###3463 And any of our programs that you feel like you might be able to
###3468 have some additional insights in, be aggressive in doing that.
###3473 I learned a new motto in Texas, I think, which was,
###3479 "In God we trust.
###3480 All others must bring data."
###3482 (laughter)
###3485 And I think we've got to recognize that.
###3487 The one thing I do, as, the one thing that I really do -- and I
###3491 am very committed to using data and analyzing it in an
###3497 evidence-based research fashion, but I also think it is very
###3501 important to not lose sight that there are real
###3503 faces behind that data.
###3509 And these kids are as diverse as they are individuals.
###3514 And I think that's the real value of this one-on-one
###3518 mentoring program that you all are talking about,
###3521 is there's a real recognition of that.
###3523 Yes, ma'am.
###3523 Audience member: I think you will be proud to know our
###3525 Big Brother of the Year and our Big Sister of the Year and their
###3527 Littles, and there's something special you want to know about
###3530 our Big Brother of the Year and his Little Brother -- why don't
###3533 you guy stand up -- our Bigs of the Year,
###3534 and tell them where you're from.
###3536 George Sheldon: Which one's the big one and which one's the little one?
###3538 (laughter)
###3539 Audience member: I'm older, and we live in Tallahassee.
###3542 George Sheldon: Oh, welcome.
###3543 (applause)
###3545 Audience member: Born and raised in Tallahassee.
###3549 Lived there all our lives, so we're Floridians
###3551 through and through.
###3553 It's quite an honor to be here.
###3554 George Sheldon: Well, thank you.
###3555 I did stay up last night and watched Florida State
###3562 beat Stanford --
###3564 (laughter)
###3565 -- 18 to 7.
###3566 It was close.
###3567 (laughter)
###3571 Audience member: Thank you very much.
###3572 Audience member -- (inaudible)
###3573 a year behind --
###3575 George Sheldon: Stand up.
###3577 (applause)
###3585 Yes, ma'am.
###3586 Audience member: Thank you very much for pointing out the
###3588 importance of listening to the children, and the voices,
###3592 and the impact of their statements.
###3595 Many of our agencies have waiting lists where children,
###3600 the parents themselves have called in.
###3602 They're almost equal the number of children that we're serving.
###3606 So talk about a groundswell of support and yearning for the
###3610 kinds of services that we offer.
###3612 How can DHHS either through policy or resources help us
###3617 address this groundswell, this massive need that is out there
###3622 for children who need our service?
###3624 George Sheldon: Well, and I'll be honest with you,
###3626 I don't have all the answers to that question,
###3630 because you've been reading the newspaper,
###3635 we're dealing with constricting budgets,
###3638 and that constricting budget at the federal level is
###3642 impacting state and local's disproportionately, even,
###3646 if you look at it.
###3648 So I think we've got to be a little more innovative and a
###3651 little more -- we've got to do a lot more to integrate our
###3656 programs together, and recognize that we can no longer afford the
###3663 inefficiency of various streams of funding.
###3666 And that means, the extent to which we can -- and we're
###3671 desperately trying to break the silos down.
###3673 The extent to which we can integrate what's happening to
###3676 child support around a child, and that those child support
###3681 dollars are really focused on going to the child,
###3685 and we've got some policies forthcoming to do that.
###3688 And the extent to which we can also leverage
###3691 TANF in that family.
###3694 So I think part of that is how we do it.
###3697 I think that I would be all ears for any suggestions that you
###3704 might have as to how efforts that we have at the federal
###3708 government can greater impact the ability to do that
###3710 at the local level.
###3712 States are very important to this process.
###3715 And so I think it is important to work with your local
###3719 commissioners, in the children and families area.
###3724 I think TANF is one of the most flexible that -- I think you do
###3731 need to keep reminding state agencies, as we will,
###3735 about the flexible use of TANF.
###3739 Yes, sir.
###3740 And then I'll come --
###3741 Audience member: (inaudible)
###3744 -- receive TANF dollars, would you be interested or willing
###3748 before you send a letter out to your states to learn what the 20
###3754 or so Big Brother Big Sister agencies are doing with creative
###3758 programs and maybe --
###3760 George Sheldon: You're here in D.C., right?
###3761 Audience member: Yes.
###3762 George Sheldon: Yeah, I'd be happy,
###3763 I'd be happy to sit down with some folks and explore what kind
###3767 of guidance would be helpful, recognizing the constraints on
###3773 our budget, but I would be very open to that,
###3777 because I -- as I indicated, all the knowledge
###3780 doesn't reside here.
###3782 Definitely here.
###3783 But here in D.C.
###3785 Audience member: Because I'm sure a lot of other agencies
###3788 across the country are using TANF dollars, creatively.
###3791 George Sheldon: Yeah, I think states can learn from each other.
###3794 And I think one thing is to get the APHSA,
###3799 the American Public Human Service Association.
###3803 And I don't mind engaging with them.
###3806 We also just hired someone away from the National Governors'
###3809 Association who probably knows TANF as well as anybody in the
###3812 country, so maybe I can sit down with her.
###3816 And I promised one and I know I'm violating a rule --
###3819 Audience member: (inaudible)
###3822 I think one of the things that we've been looking at is how we
###3824 can collaborate better with different agencies,
###3829 and the more that I think the government and you all who are
###3833 providing us resources can encourage that collaboration and
###3838 incent those agencies that work together and get rid of the
###3842 redundancies would be useful as well.
###3846 George Sheldon: I appreciate that, and we will. Let's get together.
###3849 One thing that we are doing under the Affordable Care Act,
###3853 the Affordable Care Act, among other things, you know,
###3857 you can say whatever you want about it,
###3858 there are a lot of amazing things about it.
###3861 But what it basically did is it gave 100 percent federal money
###3865 to develop the information system for the insurance
###3868 exchanges, 90 percent, 90-10 for Medicaid.
###3872 OMB about six, eight months ago gave us a waiver so that states
###3877 can now plan that large technology system and bring
###3883 Human Services in to it, and Human Services doesn't have to
###3887 share in the cost of development of the big system.
###3889 So information sharing is important.
###3893 And I think, frankly, and a lot of states,
###3896 in their advance planning documents,
###3899 have really indicated a willingness to go after those
###3901 dollars and bring Human Services in.
###3903 I think that is a major step in breaking down some of the silos.
###3908 In Florida, for instance, I had real difficulties, for instance,
###3912 getting my agency to talk to the Medicaid agency.
###3915 And yet Medicaid funded a lot of services to the people that we
###3920 served.
###3921 And breaking down, and -- I think this technology
###3924 thing can do that.
###3925 Thank you very much and come back to Washington.
###3928 (applause)
###3935 Kareem Dale: All right, thank you very much to George for
###3937 that valuable information.
###3939 So, as we prepare to wrap up here,
###3942 our final speaker for today is a man who needs no introduction,
###3949 a man who actually in my role as disability policy leader for the
###3953 Administration, is -- the Department of Justice has done
###3958 an unbelievable job on civil rights for all Americans,
###3962 including Americans with disabilities,
###3965 and also whose man is a very staunch advocate for mentoring
###3969 and the benefits of that.
###3970 I think you're going to hear a little bit of that
###3973 from him today.
###3974 So without further ado, let me introduce to you the
###3977 Attorney General of the United States, Eric H. Holder.
###3981 (applause)
###3990 Attorney General Eric Holder: Good afternoon.
###3991 Good afternoon.
###3993 Audience members: Good afternoon.
###3993 Attorney General Eric Holder: So I'm the last speaker, huh?
###3995 Audience members: Yes.
###3995 Attorney General Eric Holder: I'm all that separates you from
###3997 whatever you're going to do next.
###3999 Did someone say cocktails?
###4000 Ooh, ooh, ooh, we've got a live crew here.
###4005 I was told as I walked in, though,
###4006 this is being live streamed, which means like, you know,
###4008 my fun quotient went way down, folks.
###4011 (laughter)
###4011 If it was just going to be us here,
###4013 we could have some good times, some jokes, talk about Congress,
###4015 but, you know, I can't do that now. So.
###4017 (laughter)
###4020 I promise, I promise, I promise.
###4021 I want to thank Kareem for those kind words,
###4023 and for all that he and his colleagues at the White House
###4027 Office of Public Engagement have done to bring us all
###4029 together here today.
###4030 This is something that for me is a real treat.
###4032 I started out this morning talking to the League of women
###4034 voters about a whole variety of things that have been kind of in
###4039 the news lately, and, you know, voting rights and things like
###4042 that, and this is I think a good way to bookend what
###4044 otherwise has been a not really enjoyable day.
###4047 But so I'm glad to end it with you all.
###4050 (laughter)
###4051 It is really a pleasure for me to be here with you,
###4052 and a privilege to join so many advocates, allies,
###4056 and partners in calling attention to this critical and
###4059 really growing need for mentors in neighborhoods
###4062 across this country.
###4063 Now for more than a century Big Brothers and Big Sisters of
###4068 America has led the way in encouraging community leaders to
###4071 give of their time and talents to support America's young
###4075 people, especially those who are at risk and those
###4077 who are in need.
###4079 Last year alone, these are really pretty amazing
###4081 statistics, more than 350 local Big Brothers Big Sisters
###4084 agencies served over 200,000 children nationwide.
###4088 That is very significant.
###4090 Their ongoing efforts have raised awareness about the
###4092 importance of positive role models and demonstrated the
###4096 enduring impact that each mentor can have.
###4099 So this afternoon I'm proud to stand with so many
###4102 administration leaders, many of whom have come by here,
###4105 and understand that at least some of you had a chance to meet
###4107 the big guy today, is that right?
###4109 Who got to see the President?
###4112 Don't hate him, don't hate him.
###4113 (laughter)
###4115 All right.
###4116 How was that selection determination made?
###4119 Audience member: Big Brother of the year, 2011 and 2012 --
###4121 (inaudible)
###4124 Attorney General Eric Holder: Okay.
###4125 And how was it decided who would meet with me?
###4127 (laughter)
###4129 Everybody, right?
###4131 Audience member: Everybody --
###4132 (inaudible)
###4133 Attorney General Eric Holder: That's all right, no, no,
###4134 don't try to clean it up, don't try to clean it up, that's okay.
###4136 All right.
###4138 But I am really proud to stand with so many people from the
###4140 Administration in celebrating this organization's
###4144 accomplishments, and commending you on yet really another
###4147 extraordinary year.
###4149 But I also recognize that this leadership summit is much more
###4152 than an occasion for reflecting on the record of success that
###4155 you have helped to establish.
###4157 It also presents an opportunity to recommit ourselves to
###4161 building on this progress and to continuing the unfinished work
###4164 that still stands before us.
###4166 Today, again some other startling statistics: More than
###4169 a million students drop out of high school every year,
###4172 and many of those kids start down the wrong path,
###4175 turning to violence, criminal behavior, substance abuse,
###4179 and just over 2 million kids per year are arrested.
###4182 A third of all children and half of all low-income
###4184 youth fail to graduate from high school on time.
###4188 Nearly a third of those between the ages of 12 and 17 have
###4191 recently reported using alcohol or marijuana,
###4194 and today one in four violent crime victims known to law
###4197 enforcement -- children, think about that -- one in four
###4200 violent crime victims known to law enforcement are children.
###4203 Now you've heard, you know, these alarming statistics.
###4206 You're familiar with the heartbreaking stories and
###4208 probably have seen some of this harsh reality firsthand.
###4212 You also understand that we have a responsibility to confront
###4215 this problem, and you've led the way in responding to this
###4218 crisis, not with despair, but with resolve.
###4222 By serving as the role models that so many children lack,
###4225 you've shown how mentors can teach really invaluable lessons,
###4228 help young people develop the skills they need for future
###4231 success, and instill a sense of self worth and self respect.
###4236 You have proven that mentors can fill a void,
###4238 helping to guide and encourage children as they set and achieve
###4242 goals and develop the confidence necessary to
###4245 fulfill their potential.
###4246 Now, studies have really consistently shown that through
###4249 stable and consistent, consistent personal engagement,
###4253 mentored children are more likely to grow and mature
###4256 into confident and responsible young adults.
###4260 Now one report found that children matched with a Big
###4262 Brother or a Big Sister were nearly 50 percent less likely to
###4266 begin using illegal drugs and more than 50 percent less
###4269 likely to skip school.
###4271 Great statistics.
###4272 Over the years we've also seen that investing in mentoring
###4275 programs makes basic economic sense.
###4277 This is a time of, you know, great economic problems we've
###4280 had in terms of budgets and things like that nature.
###4283 In fact if we were to increase the high school graduation rate
###4286 among male students by just 5 percent,
###4288 estimates suggest that our country would save close to $8
###4291 billion in criminal justice spending.
###4293 So there's a direct correlation between those things.
###4296 But as I'm sure we can all say from personal experience,
###4300 one of the greatest joys of mentoring is that the benefits
###4302 really run both ways.
###4303 It doesn't just go to the kids.
###4306 During my time as United States Attorney for the District of
###4309 Columbia during the Clinton Administration,
###4311 my staff and I adopted an elementary school in a
###4314 low-income, predominantly African-American part of
###4317 Washington, D.C.
###4318 I was really thrilled to have a chance to work with these kids
###4321 on a regular basis, getting to know them,
###4324 becoming invested in their futures,
###4326 and finding a remarkable and rewarding sense of purpose in
###4329 the relationships that we developed in my office and
###4332 with that school.
###4334 As a result, I'm really proud to say that I know well and have
###4337 seen firsthand that mentoring changes lives,
###4340 and not just for the students.
###4342 The prosecutors in my office, hard-boiled, you know,
###4345 long-time prosecutors, were changed as a result of their
###4349 interaction with these kids at Amidon Elementary School.
###4352 And that's one of the many reasons why I've been honored
###4354 to join the President, the First Lady,
###4357 and others throughout the Administration in supporting
###4359 mentoring programs.
###4360 We've made great strides in bringing stakeholders,
###4363 including federal officials, state and local partners,
###4366 community organizations, and leaders like yourselves together
###4369 to discuss how mentors can improve educational outcomes and
###4373 to reduce juvenile delinquency.
###4376 And I believe that there's good reason to be optimistic about
###4379 the continued progress that we'll achieve through
###4381 initiatives like the First Lady's Corporate Mentoring
###4384 Challenge, as additional partners rally to this effort,
###4388 and in the robust, ongoing work of today's Justice Department.
###4391 Over the last three years my colleagues and I have made a
###4394 strong and in some cases really unprecedented commitment to
###4397 expanding federal assistance for mentoring initiatives and
###4400 exploring evidence-based strategies for reducing
###4404 children's exposure to violence.
###4406 Since 1994, the Department's Office of Juvenile Justice and
###4410 Delinquency Prevention has awarded more than $480 million
###4414 to support mentoring programs.
###4416 (applause)
###4420 And there was a direct connection between great
###4424 mentoring and good anti-crime efforts.
###4426 People sometimes don't see that connection,
###4429 but we certainly realize that that exists in this
###4431 Justice Department.
###4432 This past March we announced a $20 million grant solicitation
###4436 for research proposals that can give us a better sense of
###4439 which of these programs are most effective.
###4442 Now, these investments will help to strengthen the progress
###4445 that's been made through the Department's Defending Childhood
###4448 Initiative, which was launched in 2010 as part of an effort to
###4452 help us better understand and more effectively
###4455 combat youth violence.
###4457 And it will build upon a critical work that's under way
###4459 in ten cities nationwide as part of the National Forum on
###4463 Youth Violence Prevention.
###4464 Now as a result of these really broad-based collaborative
###4467 efforts, I think that we're making meaningful, measurable,
###4470 measurable progress in assisting the young people who
###4473 need our help the most.
###4475 But as you all know, this work is far from over.
###4478 Countless at-risk youth, foster kids,
###4481 young people in tribal lands and juvenile offenders rejoining
###4485 their communities are really still in desperate need of our
###4488 help, and every last one of them must continue to be the top
###4492 priority for each and every one of us.
###4495 Now it's no exaggeration to say that our nation's future will be
###4497 defined and its progress determined by the support that
###4501 we offer and the doors that we open for our young people.
###4506 But as I look out over this crowd today,
###4508 I cannot help but feel confident in our ability to rise to this
###4512 challenge and to bring about the change that our
###4514 young people deserve.
###4516 Never forget that they are depending on us.
###4519 These kids are depending on us.
###4521 And know that President Obama and I,
###4523 along with so many others in this Administration,
###4525 are counting on each of you to keep up your outstanding work
###4528 and to continue driving these efforts forward.
###4531 I look forward to working with you all in the coming months
###4534 and years to make America what it should be for
###4537 all of our children.
###4538 Thank you so much.
###4539 (applause)
###4556 Kareem Dale: All right.
###4556 Well, I guess that brings us to the conclusion of
###4561 our event today.
###4562 A few things that I want to touch on before we
###4566 let you all depart.
###4570 One encouragement or two encouragements, maybe,
###4572 and then one announcement of something you all
###4575 can take with you.
###4577 The two encouragements are, number one,
###4580 we need you all to get involved.
###4582 And we need you all to get involved for yourselves,
###4585 for your communities, but for your young people,
###4587 and not just only on mentoring.
###4590 You've heard a lot today about mentoring and the things that
###4593 are great about Big Brothers Big Sisters,
###4596 but there's a lot that this President is fighting for that
###4599 benefits you all, but that even more importantly benefits
###4603 the future of our country.
###4604 And that's the young people that you all mentor.
###4606 So we need you all to get involved.
###4608 We believe that the President, the Attorney General,
###4611 and so many others in our Administration are fighting for
###4616 Americans, fighting for Americans to be able to achieve.
###4621 And so we need you all involved in that effort.
###4625 The second encouragement really relates to getting involved.
###4628 And I'll give you an example of, you know,
###4630 things that you can do to get involved.
###4632 We need you to be aware of what we're doing and the fights
###4635 that are going on in our country right now.
###4638 One that I think should be near and dear to your heart is the
###4643 fight that's going on right now regarding student loans.
###4645 And I don't know if all of you all have heard about that,
###4648 but the rates for college students,
###4651 some of whom are here today, just some college students,
###4656 the rates on college student loans are going to double if
###4660 Congress doesn't pass action to stop those rates
###4664 from doubling by July.
###4666 And so the President has been vocal in his support for not
###4672 doubling student loan rates and for making sure that students
###4676 don't have that happen to them.
###4679 They are the future of our country,
###4681 and the President has been pushing for that effort.
###4684 We need you all to get involved and support that effort for the
###4687 student loans, the student loan rates not to double.
###4690 There are all types of Twitter, hashtags,
###4693 if you will -- they've told me that's what it's called,
###4695 I'm not a Twitter guy myself.
###4698 But there are hashtags involved, I'm sure there's stuff on
###4701 Facebook, I'm sure the students have heard about it,
###4704 I'm sure that many of you all in this room have heard about it,
###4706 but this is impacting the students that you are mentoring
###4710 now, for those who are in college or who are maybe getting
###4713 ready to graduate from college, and those who are coming up in
###4715 the future who are preparing to go to college.
###4718 And this is an important fight, and so we need you
###4721 all's voices to be heard.
###4723 And for you all to get engaged and know what's going on in your
###4725 community and support the effort for student loan
###4728 rates to not double.
###4729 That's just one example of the many things that are going on
###4732 in this country and that are going to be going on over the
###4734 next five or six months.
###4736 So I strongly encourage you all to pay attention to what's going
###4741 on, get involved on behalf of yourselves, your families,
###4746 and the students who represent the future of this country.
###4750 So thank you all very, very much for joining us today.
###4752 We're delighted to have you all.
###4754 Please stay in touch, please check out our White House
###4756 website, as I talked about, and stay involved.
###4759 And then as you depart here to my left and your right,
###4763 we do have copies of President Obama's proclamation from
###4769 last year on mentoring.
###4771 I forgot the month that it was --it's national mentoring month
###4774 Audience members: January.
###4775 Kareem Dale: Yeah. So everybody knows that.
###4777 (laughter)
###4778 So we have signed official copies of his proclamation for
###4781 each one of you all to take -- one, so your colleagues get one,
###4785 too -- take one with you as a memento.
###4788 So thank you very much.
###4789 (applause)
