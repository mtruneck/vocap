###2 CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: All week we`ve been looking at different aspects of this massive
###5 storm named Sandy. We`ve talked about the science behind it, what happened when it hit
###9 the U.S., the devastation that it left behind. Today we are going to take a look at how Sandy
###15 affected people on an individual level. Plus, we`re going to take a look ahead the next
###19 Tuesday as the presidential campaigns make their final push. I`m Carl Azuz. This is CNN
###24 STUDENT NEWS.
###31 When you`ve lived through something like Sandy, how do you balance the need to emotionally
###47 recover with the need to get back some sense of normalcy? A lot of people are struggling
###52 with that question right now.

###53 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You can`t describe it in words, because there is nothing -- nothing,
###57 all you see is burnt out rubble. That`s it. Burnt out rubble.
###62 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You know, it is no words to put on what happened here, but we -- we
###67 got to start over and bring back this community.
###71 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You take a lot of stuff for granted, I think until you get to this
###74 point, and then now it`s -- you just want to get back to it, you know, you want everything
###78 back that you complained about a week ago.
###79 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I just want to get back in there, get the kids back to school and
###82 things like that, get our life back.
###83 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###84 AZUZ: In New York and New Jersey, people are trying to get back to their normal routines,
###88 but things aren`t normal. This line, it`s for a bus. With huge sections of the subway
###95 shutdown, bus service is trying to help now. Some people said it took four or five hours
###100 to get to work on Thursday. And how about checking your email or sending a text? Millions
###105 of people still didn`t have power on Thursday, couldn`t even charge their phones. Some of
###109 the ones who did, were offering it up to neighbors. They set up charging stations, running extension
###115 cords and power strips out of their homes for anyone to use, the sign of community coming
###120 together as it tries to recover.
###122 On our blog, it`s cnnstudentnews.com, jobs, the economy and education top your list of
###128 election issues.
###129 Priscilla is concerned about all three. "With the prices of everything going up, including
###133 college, it is really going to be a challenge to attain a higher education."
###137 Carol says, "... there are enough jobs for the people who have just graduated college.
###140 I am worried I won`t be able to support myself when I graduate."
###144 Max writes," ... education should be the top concern. If we have a good educational system,
###149 we will be able to make jobs and help the economy at the same time."
###152 Some folks like Joshua had a different take, the biggest issue for him is deficit reduction.
###157 As a large deficit could lead to a default on our debt.
###161 Jabari also notes the debt, saying, "new ways to try to fix it might not help."
###165 Austin writes, "It`s the high price of fuel. I think that if the price of gas were lower,
###170 more people would have jobs ..."
###172 And Brittany feels that Obama and Romney should talk more about what will happen when schools
###176 have to fire teachers because the school is low on money."
###181 People who think jobs are the number one election issue, might focus on a government report
###184 that comes out every month. It updates the national unemployment rate and says how many
###189 jobs were added the month before. The latest numbers come out today, and they are the last
###193 ones coming out before Tuesday`s election. You could be sure the presidential candidates
###198 will be talking about this report and hoping it helps them gain some support on Tuesday.
###203 We looked at Governor Romney and President Obama`s economic policies earlier this week.
###207 Today, as we wrap up our series on the candidates` positions we are focusing on foreign policy.
###213 That covers a lot of issues, so we are going to cover two of them today. First one, the
###217 war in Afghanistan. President Obama has announced the plan that would have U.S. combat troops
###222 out of Afghanistan by 2014. Governor Romney has said, he supports gradually pulling American
###227 forces out of Afghanistan, but he`s criticized the president for announcing the timetable.
###233 Next up, Iran. When it comes to that country`s controversial nuclear program, the U.S. presidential
###238 candidates share a lot of the same basic ideas. Neither one wants Iran to be able to develop
###243 a nuclear weapon. Both support the idea of using sanctions, punishments against Iran
###248 and neither one has ruled out the idea of using military force against Iran.
###253 We have a ton of resources on the presidential election on our home page. Go to cnnstudentnews.com,
###259 check out the election resources bin.
###261 We are in the home stretch of this presidential campaign. For some folks, it feels like it`s
###266 going on forever. It`s this idea called voter fatigue. That after months and months of the
###271 speeches and the rallies, the media coverage and especially the ads, some people are just
###276 worn out. Presidential candidates have been making political ads for decades, but they
###281 haven`t always look like the ones we see today. Watch this.
###283 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
###284 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You like Ike, I like Ike, everybody likes Ike.
###285 DARRELL WEST, BROOKINGS INSTITUTION: The way that candidates communicate with voters tells
###291 us a lot about the politicians, but also about ourselves.
###295 JOHN F. KENNEDY: This is candidate John Kennedy.
###297 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: President Johnson.
###298 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Jimmy Carter.
###299 WEST: So, it`s an amazing lens on American culture and on American politics.`
###304 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This time, vote like your whole world depended on it.
###309 WEST: The biggest difference in ads that we see today is really in the editing. Today,
###315 we have a much faster pace, they splice different images together, there is much greater sophistication
###322 in the production that lies behind contemporary ads.
###326 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Eisenhower answers America.
###329 WEST: The first presidential election where TV ads played a role was 1952, Dwight Eisenhower
###337 pulled together footage from press conferences and basically had "Eisenhower Answering America."
###344 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This historic moment is brought to you by Citizens for Kennedy.
###347 WEST: 1960 is really considered the first television election, that was the first election
###353 where we had TV debates between Kennedy and Nixon, ads also were seen as very prominent,
###360 because it was a wave for Kennedy to basically contrast his youthfulness with Nixon experience.
###367 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They understand what peace demands.
###370 WEST: 1964 was a very interesting election, and it featured a lot of attack ads.
###376 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Four, five, six ...
###378 WEST: There was a famous ad called "the daisy ad", incumbent president Lyndon Johnson had
###382 a little girl in a meadow pulling petals off of a daisy and in the background you have
###388 the countdown, and at the end of the end, there is a nuclear explosion.
###392 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Nine, eight, seven, six, five ...
###394 WEST: By today standards, it seems remarkably tame, because we`ve seen a lot more vicious
###400 and personal attacks on individuals. But when that ad aired, it actually only aired once
###407 on network television, the public outcry was so strong that Johnson took down that ad and
###414 never aired it again.
###414 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
###415 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Today`s "Shoutout" goes out to Mrs. Golden`s U.S. and world history
###421 classes at the Augusta Fells Savage Institute of Visual Arts in Baltimore, Maryland. Who
###428 painted this famous artwork? You know what to do. Was it Leonardo, Michelangelo, Donatello
###435 or Raphael? You`ve got three seconds, go!
###440 You`re looking at Michelangelo`s masterpiece on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. That`s
###450 your answer and that`s your "Shoutout."
###453 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###456 AZUZ: Michelangelo`s masterpiece is celebrating a big birthday this week. In 1512, exactly
###462 500 years ago, it was finished and open to the public. The different panels on the Sistine
###468 Chapel ceiling show people and events from the Bible. The most famous one is the creation
###473 of Adam, which shows the arms of God and Adam reaching out to each other. The painting has
###477 survived centuries of war and severe weather. But now, it`s facing a new threat, one that
###483 comes from an unexpected source.
###485 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
###486 BEN WEDEMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Today the greatest threat to this priceless art comes
###490 from those who flock to admire it. About 5 million people visit the Sistine Chapel every
###496 year, that means 5 million people with sweat, with heat, with dust.
###504 The number of visitors is expected only to grown in coming years. The Vatican is planning
###509 to upgrade the current climate control system for the chapel, but officials are hesitant
###515 to turn tourists away.
###516 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###516 AZUZ: We don`t have to wait till next Tuesday for election results, thanks to some presidential
###521 prognosticators. Like the Redskins rule. If the team wins its last home game before the
###527 election, the person or party in power stays there. Road team wins, expect a victory for
###533 the White House challenger. Has that ever been manipulated before? We`d be worried about
###537 pass interference.
###538 If football is not your cup of tea, try coffee. 711 is selling Obama and Romney cups of java,
###544 those results will be hot off the presses. Halloween may be over, but some people think
###547 they can predict the presidency based on which candidate`s mask sold more. On election day,
###553 they`ll face reality. And the squirrel can tell us the outcome based on which dish it
###558 eats from. Some of these ideas seem a little wacky, that squirrel one is downright nuts,
###563 but hey, listen, it`s not scientific, it just food for thought. One thing we can predict,
###568 we will be back on the air next Monday, so we hope to see you then, and that you have
###572 a wonderful weekend. Bye now.
