###0 As the Mid Ocean Ridge pulls apart
###3 there's decompression of the material underneath it, and that creates melting
###7 Decompression is simply removing the pressure from a pile of rock
###11 it's much like opening a can of soda
###13 or popping the cork off of a champagne bottle
###15 The removal of so much pressure
###18 makes the rock melt into liquid magma
###21 And the Hot Spot is transporting heat directly from the interior of the earth to the surface
###24 which also creates melting
###27 So this combination of decompression of existing rock beneath the surface
###30 and the direct transport of heat from the center of the earth created huge amounts of magma
###37 This incredible meeting of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and Hot Spot
###40 began to build the island beneath the waves
###43 pushing it upwards and giving birth to Iceland
###49 Scientists have dated the island's emergence to 20 million years ago
###52 but could only imagine what this might have looked like
###56 But on November 14th, 1963, off the south coast of Iceland
###61 The world watched an action-replay of Iceland's spectacular birth
###70 A column of rock and ash blasted out of the ocean
###73 18.000 feet (5.400 m) into the sky
###76 So high it could be seen 70 miles (110 Km) away in Iceland's capital city, Reykjavík
###83 A new island was forming, right in front of the world's eyes
###90 Scientists called it Surtsey after the Norse god of fire: Surtr
###98 Located 20 miles (32 Km) off the mainland,
###100 the small island of Surtsey is now a magnet for geologists
###106 It offers a wealth of forensic evidence for Dr. La Femina,
###109 who is investigating how Iceland first formed
###116 It'a amazing to see Surtsey for the first time
###118 I've seen pictures, I've seen aerial photographs
###120 but actually be here and get a chance to
###123 to go out and see it up close and actually look at the geology
###126 it's just inspiring
###135 This type of eruption that formed Surtsey has now been named after Surtsey
###139 We call them "Surtseyan Eruptions",
###141 and they're very, very explosive
###143 The interaction of hot magma or lava with the ocean
###147 causes these very steam-rich and highly explosive eruptions
###151 of ash and water
###154 When scientists first stepped foot into the island in the summer of '64
###158 they found it hard to believe that this was an island whose age
###162 was measured in MONTHS, not millenia
###165 In about 9,5 months this whole volcanic cone built up
###170 In addition, lava flows came out of the volcanic center here
###174 and we seen those as nice black cliffs in front of us
###179 Now geologists had an insight into how early Iceland might have formed
###184 In only 20 million years, Iceland grew from a tiny island into a 40.000 square mile (104.000 Km2) landmass,
###192 as big as the state of Kentucky
###197 The forces that powered Iceland's volcanoes
###200 have been revealed
###202 Cracks along Hekla volcano unleashed gigantic fissure eruptions
###208 and rare chemicals in the rock proved
###211 that these eruptions were fuelled by two separated forces:
###216 Mid-Atlantic Ridge and the Hot Spot
###220 Iceland grew to become the world's largest volcanic island
###225 But volcanism alone doesn't explain how the land of Iceland was formed
###231 The investigation will honour another equally dramatic force
###235 that sculpted the distinctive shape of the Iceland we know today
###239 A force which would challenge the might of Iceland's volcanoes
###251 If Iceland was formed by fire alone,
###253 it should look like other volcanic islands such as Hawaii or Tahiti
###258 But something else was at work here to transform this island
###263 into the distinctive shape it is today
###267 Its shape is another clue to Iceland's formation
###271 An extraordinary force indented Iceland's Northern coastline
###275 burrowing deep fjords which extended far inland
###281 But, what colossal force could cause such a dramatic change to Iceland's volcanic landscape?
###287 There's an obvious suspect that is found scattered across the island:
###292 Ice
###294 As its name suggests, Iceland has a long history of being covered in ice, like this
###302 Today it covers 10% of the island
###304 all year round
###307 And in the middle of the country lies Europe's biggest ice cap:
###312 The mighty Vatnajökull
###317 Over 3000 square miles (7.800 Km2) in size
###319 Vatnajökull is so large it even has its own climatic conditions
###327 Up to two thirds of a mile (1 Km) thick,
###328 it squashes the land like a giant slab of rock
###332 and at its edges great tongues of ice
###335 flow out through deep valleys
###344 Glacier expert Dr. Mattew Roberts
###346 is investigating how ice can gauge out solid rock
###350 and discover the role it is playing in Iceland's past
###360 This is a GPS receiver, just like in car satellite navigation
###363 it's used here to measure glacier movement
###366 this will be left on the ice surface for a few days
###368 and I'll come back and analyse the data
###370 to discover just how far the glacier has moved
###374 Dr. Roberts data reveals that this whole glacier is sliding forward
###379 at an astounding rate of 2 feet (0,6 m) ... per day!
###384 This is an amazing ever changing environement: The ice around me is like
###387 an icy sea that has been frozen in place
###390 As the ice flows out to the confines of the valley
###394 it expands, it spreads to occupy a greater area
###396 Now as it expands, crevasses form
###399 In large depressions, just like the one here,
###402 (here's a smaller crevasse that is formed)
###404 ocasionally when these crevasses open, as it begin to open,
###407 sounds can be heard
###409 Also, the glacier ocasionally makes a groaning sound
###413 it's all signs that the glacier is alive and moving forward
###416 very slowly
###420 Vatnajökull is one of the largest ice caps in the northern hemisphere
###426 flowing down the valleys, the great mass of ice
###428 bears down with the weight of 100 tons per square foot (975 tons/m2)
###434 Dr. Roberts believes this moving giant is a force
###437 capable of eroding solid rock,
###439 and he has found crucial evidence to prove it
###442 This is an excellent example of the power of glacial erosion
###446 This boulder would have been trapped beneath the base of the ice
###448 and, as the ice flowed over the surface of it,
###451 it would have progressively eroded the surface of the boulder
###454 to produce these very distinctive marks, called striations, in its surface
###458 We can even tell the direction in wich the ice was flowing
###461 If I take a rock, I can illustrate this
###464 Imagine this is the base of the ice,
###467 the material trapped inside the ice
###469 being dragged across as the glacier moved
###472 to produce this very distinctive marks in the surface
###476 This is just like sandpaper over wood,
###478 the same erosive effect
###481 The erosive process that's happening on this boulder
###484 is the same process that's happening on a much larger scale
###487 along the surface of these valleys
###490 The glacier is responsible for literally carving the landscape,
###493 producing very distinctive throughs and basins
###497 which were formerly infilled with solid rock
###499 This really testifies the erosive power of a glacier
###505 The ancient fjords on the north coast
###507 are the same deep-basin shape
###510 Which means they must once have been filled with ice
###516 Scientists now know that around 1,5 million years ago
###520 changes in the earth's orbit and the tilt of its axis
###523 began to cool the planet
###527 An enormous ice sheet descended from the north
###530 and shrouded Iceland in a cloak of ice
###535 As the ice advanced and retreated,
###537 it carved out deep fjords
###539 and indented Iceland's northern coastline
###544 Ice was a formidable force in Iceland
###547 and many volcanoes laid at tomb beneath it
###552 Fire and ice were now locked in a titanic battle of supremacy
###557 When the giant ice sheets that carved the fjords
###560 put out the fires that created Iceland
###569 The first clue lies in this ancient valley, 5 miles (8 Km) west of the glacier
###576 The valley floor is strewed with hundreds of giant boulders
###579 but it's how they got here that interests Dr. Roberts
###584 These boulders provide a lot of insight into how this landscape was formed
###588 The boulders clusted together and, interestingly,
###591 this boulders are rounded, which shows they've been rolling
###594 And the boulders have been brought together by some dynamical force
###598 We can also see smaller boulders trapped in the center
###601 And it's quite clear that flowing water is the cause of this
###604 But this would haven't been water in the stream that we see in the background
###608 this would have been water produced by a much larger, faster flow
###613 that would have inundated this entire valley
###617 Dr. Roberts has an extraordinay theory about what happened here:
###621 In ancient times, a cataclysmic flood 100 feet (30 m) high cut through this valley
###628 It was so powerful that it rolled this giant boulders like pebbles in a stream
###632 before dumping them on the landscape
###638 But what could create such a colossal flow of water?
###643 Dr. Roberts suspects the flood came from the mighty Vatnajökull glacier
###647 and he's hunting for clues
###652 With such a huge area to cover, Dr. Roberts takes to the air
###663 His investigation leads him to a crucial peace of evidence:
###668 This strange bowl-like depression on the surface of the ice
###673 This is an amazing location. This giant depression in the ice has been formed
###677 as a pocket of water drained from beneath the base of the ice cap
###682 The beautiful concentric crevasses that you see on the ice surface were formed
###686 as the ice slowly crept into the hole of this pit created as the waters drained the way
###695 Beneath the ice, a dynamic process is happening
###699 Hot magma and steam are melting the glacier from underneath
###704 The meltwater collects in a huge ice basin at the top of the volcano
###710 The basin slowly fills. But as it does, the surrounding ice becomes unstable,
###718 cracks up here, in the ice basin. And as the hot water drains away,
###722 it forms a tunnel which channels the water to the edge of the glacier
###729 This would suggest that volcanic eruptions still happen even under the enormous weight of ice
###736 Is this process the key to explaining the ancient cataclysmic flood?
###742 To answer this, we must go to one of Iceland's largest volcanoes:
###748 Grímsvötn
###751 Lying entombed beneath the ice in the heart of Vatnajökull
###755 This massive volcano violently erupts every 10 years
###761 Here fire and ice spectacularly collide, with Iceland's volcanoes emerging victorious
###769 Ice cannot supress the invincible power of Iceland's volcanoes
###773 which have now found a new way to vent their anger
###779 During a huge eruption like this, Grímsvötn can melt enough ice
###783 to fill America's largest man-made reservoir: Lake Mead
###788 But this vast volume of water cannot be held back by the ice for long
###793 and leads inevitabily to a massive glacial flood
###798 Such a force of nature struck Iceland in 1996 with devastating consequences,
###805 the floodwater taking out everyting in its path
###810 Bridges were torn down and swept away
###813 and the highway was submerged under water
###818 The flood itself reached a peak discharge of over 1,8 million cubic feet per second (50.000 m3/s),
###824 that's a remarkable discharge, prevalent to the summertime discharge of the river Amazon
###829 Imagine that sort of condition over a relatively small area
###835 The sheer force of the water carried icebergs the size of 4 storey buildings
###841 It's floods like these that can change the landscape in a matter of days
###847 The erosive power of the flowing water can result in tremendous amounts of rock
###852 being eroded, literally being fractured away by the high water pressure that is being created
###858 so, literally a landscape can form before your eyes during a very severe glacial flood
###865 The story of Iceland's bizarre landscape is taking shape
###871 Striations on rock prove that ice is a formidable force
###874 that carved out Iceland's unique coastline
###879 Boulders strewn in an empty valley
###881 reveal cataclysmic floods of the past
###884 And depressions in the ice confirm that Iceland's volcanoes could not be supressed
###891 But 12.000 years ago the great ice sheets retreated
###894 and Iceland was liberated from their wintery grip,
###898 Now, the effects of Iceland's volcanoes would be felt on a global scale
###909 For thusands of years Iceland's volcanoes were locked in a titanic battle with ice
###916 But then, 12.000 years ago, the giant ice sheets finally retreated
###922 This would open a new chapter in Iceland's volcanic history,
###926 as they were now free to wreak havoc
###930 But, what effect would this have on Iceland and its surroundings?
###937 One of the most dramatic effects can be found in the south-central region of the island
###945 This alien landscape is known as Laki
###951 A road of strange craters and solidified lava flows
###954 that have bubbled up from a huge tear in the earth
###959 A massive fissure eruption, it stretches for an astounding 16 miles (25 Km) across the landscape
###970 Volcanologist Dr. Thor Thordarson is investigating Laki,
###973 the site of one of the greatest eruptions in recent history,
###977 one which would have devastating effects worldwide
###981 The Laki fissures, which extend from here in the southwest,
###986 continue here through the landscape as roll cones, up in through Mount Laki
###992 which was split into 2 during the eruption
###994 and continue futher to the northeast all the way to the margins of the glaciers here
###1002 Eyewitness accounts accurately date the eruption to 1783
###1008 This was one of the most disastrous years in Icelandic history
###1013 Fallout from the eruption caused harvests all over the island to fail
###1018 75% of the livestock died, plunging Iceland into a great famine which killed 10.000 people
###1029 But mysteriously, at the same time the rest of the northern hemisphere
###1033 reported freakishly cold weather
###1037 Averaging 2,3 ºF (1,28ºC) below normal, the northern hemisphere froze over
###1046 The North Sea along the coast of Holland froze,
###1048 so people skated between villages along the coast
###1051 There was on Mississippi down by New Orleans in that winter
###1059 For many years it was thought the Laki eruption and this climatic events were unrelated,
###1065 but advances in geology found it wasn't just a bizarre coincidence
###1071 Comparing eyewitness accounts with the geological remains
###1075 Dr. Thordarson has reconstructed what happened
###1081 He discovered that the eruption started with a bang on the morning of June 8, 1783
###1088 It sent rocks flying high into the air
###1090 and ripped the earth open along a 1 mile (1,6 Km) tear
###1095 But this was just the beginning
###1099 3 days later, a second eruption ripped open, then a 3rd, 4th, 5th...
###1106 In total, the earth unzipped along 10 vast tears in the crust
###1111 erupting lava continuously for over 8 months
###1116 The mammoth amounts of lava that poured out of the ground here
###1120 would have buried Manhattah to a depth of 830 feet (250 m)
###1126 But how an eruption on this small, remote island could cause climatic chaos
###1130 thousands of miles away, remained a mystery
###1137 The evidence that would link Laki with this worldwide catastrophe
###1141 was locked inside these boulders
###1147 The story is in the rocks. This rock here is part of
###1151 the material, the magma that came out during the eruption
###1155 These holes are cold bubbles,
###1158 and they form as the magma raises from deep within the ground and approaches the surface
###1164 and it really starts to boil!
###1166 The gas, which is dissolved in the magma at depth, goes into the bubbles
###1170 then it escapes into the atmosphere
###1174 When this bubble rock erupted onto the surface
###1177 it would have poured gas out into the Icelandic atmosphere
###1184 Could this gas have caused climatic chaos across the globe?
###1192 The identity of this gas can be found in the microscopic structure of the rock
###1197 If you look closely at this rock, you can see a lot of white specks
###1201 these little white specks are the crystals who grow in the magma at depth
###1206 Sometimes this crystals, as they're growing, they would encapsulate
###1210 pristine magma and bring it up to the surface
###1214 Like time capsules, the white crystals contained untouched magma from deep in the earth
###1220 locked away since 1783
###1225 Dr. Thordarson has analysed this magma and found it to contain poisonous Sulphur Dioxide
###1232 And because there was so much lava here, it would have released enormous amounts
###1238 A staggering 100 million tons of Sulphur Dioxide gas was pumped into the atmosphere
###1248 But how could gases released from Laki cause bitterly cold weather across the globe?
###1254 The answer laid in accounts of a thick, red fog reported over Iceland in June 1783
###1262 Within a few weeks it had been blown over London and Paris
###1266 By July, it had dispersed across the entire northern hemisphere
###1273 Scientists now know that the red fog was caused by the Sulphur Dioxide which rose high into the air
###1281 Mixing with water, it created a Sulphuric Acid haze
###1286 The haze blocked out the sun, and it sent temperatures plummeting
###1292 As a result, the northern hemisphere endured 3 bitterly cold winters
###1297 which brought spring floods, famine and widespread poverty to Europe
###1304 Some historians have long believed that these climatic conditions
###1308 triggered social and political unrest, which led to the French Revolution in 1789
###1316 But scientists now suspect Laki had ramifications even further afield
###1322 The cold temperatures in the north changed air currents in the south
###1326 causing dramatic climate changes
###1330 India was hit by a terrible drought
###1333 People say that more than half a million people died from the drought in India
###1340 Also, this change in atmospheric circulation caused a very cold summer in Japan
###1346 It was cold and wet
###1348 The rice harvest failed,
###1351 and the result was the greatest famine in japanese history
###1356 It is estimated that Laki killed over 2 million people worldwide,
###1362 and was one of the most devastating volcanic eruptions in the history of mankind
###1370 The evidence has proven that Iceland's recent volcanic history
###1373 has had a devastating effect on the island and the rest of the world
###1378 Enormous lava fields reveal that Laki was a gigantic eruption
###1384 Bubbles in the rock indicate that huge volumes of gas were released from Laki
###1390 The white crystals reveal that this gas was poisonous Sulphur Dioxide,
###1396 evidence that Iceland's volcanoes caused climatic mayhem across the globe
###1404 But eruptions like Laki may not be confined to the past
###1408 Some believe that the balance between fire and ice is shifting,
###1412 and has the potential to propel Iceland into another hell on earth
###1422 The evidence is mounting, that Iceland has the potential to be the most lethal island on the planet
###1429 A fearsome volcanic force lies beneath it, creating powerful volcanoes
###1434 capable of generating gigantic lava flows and altering global climates
###1442 Yet many of Iceland's volcanoes are covered in glaciers,
###1446 fire and ice are held in a delicate balance
###1451 Scientists fear if this balance were tipped the volcanoes favour,
###1455 Iceland could become even deadlier
###1459 If the remaining ice were to melt,
###1462 what effect would it have on the activity of Iceland's volcanoes?
###1468 The first clue in the investigation lies in these innocuous-looking piles of rock and rubble
###1476 They're found all over Iceland,
###1478 and yet this rocks don't come from a volcano
###1483 They're Morraines:
###1484 The geological term for rock piles deposited at the mouth of a glacier
###1490 These deposits are evidence that the glaciers are shrinking
###1496 Year by year, the glacier has melted and retreated back up the valley,
###1500 leaving a Morraine like this behind
###1509 Dr. Roberts has studied the Vatnajökull glacier for the last ten years
###1513 and has noticed this dramatic trend
###1516 The glacier is retreating at a remarkable rate since I've been visiting the area
###1520 I've seen tremendous changes. The ice has retreated annually at a rate of about
###1524 200 feet (61 m) per year. This lake over here used to be filled with ice
###1530 I've seen the ice progressively melt, this morraine has formed,
###1532 this whole valley has become almost bare
###1536 Maybe in the next 20 years this whole glacier will disappear and a lake will form in that valley
###1542 Iceland's glaciers are melting at an unprecedented rate
###1547 With 5% of Iceland's ice caps melting in the last 40 years,
###1551 the question that scientists are keen to understand
###1554 is: What effect this rapid melting will have on the volcanoes that lie beneath?
###1562 The only other time that glaciers have melted this quickly
###1565 is when Iceland came out of the last Ice Age
###1570 But what can past events tell us about the future?
###1576 Geologist professor Bill McGuire is investigating how volcanic activity changed
###1581 at the end of the last Ice Age
###1584 And he's unearthed some surprising results
###1589 Around about 11 or 12 thousand years ago you started to see quite rapid melting of glaciers
###1594 in Iceland and elsewhere
###1595 And that triggered a recognisable increase of volcanic activity,
###1599 because you were removing this large mass of ice very, very quickly
###1603 The rapid melting of ice kick-starts volcanic eruptions beneath
###1608 Volcanic eruptions are triggered by the gas in the magma,
###1611 which expands to form bubbles and the bubbles drive the eruption
###1614 It's rather like taking the cork out of a bottle of champagne
###1618 Now, if you have a very heavy weight on top of a volcano,
###1622 if it's a heavy mass of water or ice,
###1624 that can help supress eruptive activity
###1628 But when ice melts quickly, this downward pressure is suddenly released
###1633 and that's when the trouble starts
###1637 As the ice melts, so the pressure on the magma underneath is reduced,
###1640 the gas in the magma can form bubbles, they can coalesce and they can eventually
###1645 drive the magma upwards towards the surface and trigger
###1647 other explosive eruptions or effusions of lava that are spared out at a huge distances
###1655 Iceland's glaciers are melting rapidly
###1659 This has led scientists to believe that a devastating eruption on the scale of Laki
###1664 could happen again
###1666 The question is WHEN? These are things that we have to think about
###1669 and try to prepare ourselves to deal with if they happen in our lifetime
###1675 Is it possible that we can get another eruption like this in Iceland?
###1681 Definetely
###1683 The investigation has revealed how the vast and voilent island of Iceland was formed
###1692 Cracks in the Thingvellir plane and traces of chemicals in the rocks
###1696 revealed how the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and Hot Spot joined forces to create a collossal volcanic force
###1706 Massive fissure eruptions ripped the land open
###1710 Hemorrhaging millions of tons of lava, Iceland rapidly formed
###1716 Deep northern fjords were evidence that a giant ice sheet eroded the land
###1721 and entombed the volcanoes, locking fire and ice in a titanic battle
###1729 Boulders strewn in an ancient valley reveal how fire emerged victorious
###1735 unleashing cataclysmic floods
###1738 And specks of Sulphur in the rocks showed how Iceland's volcanoes
###1743 have the potential to cause global destruction
###1747 Now, glaciers melting above some of the world's most deadly volcanoes
###1752 are increasing the threat of future eruptions
###1759 Over the last 20 million years, Iceland's almighty volcanic force
###1764 has created a vast, alien landscape
###1769 Volatile and unpredictable, it may one day unleash a massive eruption
###1774 which could devastate both Iceland and a wider world beyond
