ROBERT ALEXANDER: If you'd
asked me five years ago,


3
0:0:5,415 --> 0:0:7,64
Robert, where will you be
five years from now?


4
0:0:7,64 --> 0:0:11,983
I don't think I would've been
able to come up with an answer


5
0:0:11,983 --> 0:0:13,97
as cool as what I actually feel
like I'm doing, you know?

9
0:0:39,13 --> 0:0:41,1
ROBERT ALEXANDER: My name
is Robert Alexander.


10
0:0:41,1 --> 0:0:44,22
And I'm a data sonification
specialist with the Solar and


11
0:0:44,22 --> 0:0:45,57
Heliospheric Research Group.


12
0:0:45,57 --> 0:0:49,74
To sonify something just means
that you're taking any type of


13
0:0:49,74 --> 0:0:51,6
data and just turning
it into sound.


14
0:0:51,6 --> 0:0:54,82
So it could be a measurement
of the stock market.


15
0:0:54,82 --> 0:0:57,34
It could be a measurement
of people entering


16
0:0:57,34 --> 0:0:58,32
and exiting a room.


17
0:0:58,32 --> 0:0:59,98
It could be your heartbeat.


18
0:0:59,98 --> 0:1:1,74
So if you think about a
heart rate monitor--


19
0:1:1,74 --> 0:1:3,17
beep, beep--


20
0:1:3,17 --> 0:1:5,33
essentially, this is
a sonification


21
0:1:5,33 --> 0:1:6,58
of someone's pulse.


22
0:1:6,58 --> 0:1:12,95



23
0:1:12,95 --> 0:1:14,75
I think of myself
as an explorer.


24
0:1:14,75 --> 0:1:19,5
I live in the space between
art, and science, and


25
0:1:19,5 --> 0:1:20,13
technology.


26
0:1:20,13 --> 0:1:22,83
And the Toroidal Universe
project is a great example.


27
0:1:22,83 --> 0:1:25,51
I collaborated with this amazing
visual artist by the


28
0:1:25,51 --> 0:1:26,85
name of Danielle Battaglia.


29
0:1:26,85 --> 0:1:29,47
And we created this
multi-sensory experience in


30
0:1:29,47 --> 0:1:32,8
which people, they can just get
lost in these theoretical


31
0:1:32,8 --> 0:1:34,57
higher dimensional spaces.


32
0:1:34,57 --> 0:1:37,84
And these were filled with these
sounds that I generated


33
0:1:37,84 --> 0:1:40,65
from raw satellite data that
were these kind of guide posts


34
0:1:40,65 --> 0:1:41,9
as you move around.


35
0:1:41,9 --> 0:2:4,59



36
0:2:4,59 --> 0:2:8,4
It really is important for me to
remain grounded in what it


37
0:2:8,4 --> 0:2:11,59
means to just be connected with
the world of sound in a


38
0:2:11,59 --> 0:2:13,9
very tangible, very
visceral way.


39
0:2:13,9 --> 0:2:17,44
So then when I go off and I'm
interacting with the sun, it


40
0:2:17,44 --> 0:2:19,5
gives me a sense of grounding
in a sense.


41
0:2:19,5 --> 0:2:22,48
And it kind of helps just
round out my life and to


42
0:2:22,48 --> 0:2:24,7
maintain a healthy sort
of balance, I


43
0:2:24,7 --> 0:2:25,32
guess you could say.


44
0:2:25,32 --> 0:2:28,18



45
0:2:28,18 --> 0:2:30,5
So as I was finishing up my
master's degree, I was


46
0:2:30,5 --> 0:2:32,88
approached by Thomas Zurbuchen
who leads the Solar and


47
0:2:32,88 --> 0:2:34,7
Heliospheric Research Group.


48
0:2:34,7 --> 0:2:36,14
And he was interested in taking
some other data and


49
0:2:36,14 --> 0:2:37,18
turning it into sound.


50
0:2:37,18 --> 0:2:38,47
So I met with their team.


51
0:2:38,47 --> 0:2:40,55
And they put up a
bunch of plots.


52
0:2:40,55 --> 0:2:42,82
And they were telling me about
coronal holes, and they were


53
0:2:42,82 --> 0:2:44,84
throwing out this scientific
jargon.


54
0:2:44,84 --> 0:2:46,41
And I really didn't understand
much of it.


55
0:2:46,41 --> 0:2:49,6
But then they put up these
images and these movies.


56
0:2:49,6 --> 0:2:57,27



57
0:2:57,27 --> 0:2:59,5
And then I really started
to understand why


58
0:2:59,5 --> 0:3:0,45
they were so excited.


59
0:3:0,45 --> 0:3:3,7
It's because what's happening
out there is absolutely


60
0:3:3,7 --> 0:3:5,38
amazing, and it was
all silent.


61
0:3:5,38 --> 0:3:7,87
So essentially they're
interested in kind of creating


62
0:3:7,87 --> 0:3:10,53
a soundtrack for these things
that are taking


63
0:3:10,53 --> 0:3:11,926
place out in space.


64
0:3:11,926 --> 0:3:14,674



65
0:3:14,674 --> 0:3:19,41
SUSAN LEPRI: He brought to us
this idea of sonifying data,


66
0:3:19,41 --> 0:3:24,44
which is really quite innovative
and maybe even


67
0:3:24,44 --> 0:3:24,775
transformative.


68
0:3:24,775 --> 0:3:25,83
ROBERT ALEXANDER: I had
no idea what data


69
0:3:25,83 --> 0:3:27,35
audification was.


70
0:3:27,35 --> 0:3:30,38
But that's what I was doing at
the time is I was taking this


71
0:3:30,38 --> 0:3:34,58
solar data, and I was writing it
directly into audio files.


72
0:3:34,58 --> 0:3:35,92
So I hit play.


73
0:3:35,92 --> 0:3:40,3
And I hear this underlying
hum.


74
0:3:40,3 --> 0:3:41,86
And there seemed to
be a structure.


75
0:3:41,86 --> 0:3:44,67
The hum would rise and fall.


76
0:3:44,67 --> 0:3:48,8
So then after I crunched all the
numbers, I realized that


77
0:3:48,8 --> 0:3:50,38
what I was listening to
was something that was


78
0:3:50,38 --> 0:3:53,54
periodically happening every
roughly 27 days.


79
0:3:53,54 --> 0:3:58,6
And that's exactly the
rotational period of the sun.


80
0:3:58,6 --> 0:4:2,35



81
0:4:2,35 --> 0:4:4,82
And then, from there it was this
journey of realizing that


82
0:4:4,82 --> 0:4:6,99
I'm listening to the solar
cycle, so the rise and the


83
0:4:6,99 --> 0:4:9,11
fall in solar activity.


84
0:4:9,11 --> 0:4:12,36
And then, at that point, I
realized this can really


85
0:4:12,36 --> 0:4:14,31
actually teach us
something new.


86
0:4:14,31 --> 0:4:27,82



87
0:4:27,82 --> 0:4:31,13
At first, it came off as
extremely cerebral.


88
0:4:31,13 --> 0:4:33,7
And it was just a tone that
kind of went up and down.


89
0:4:33,7 --> 0:4:36,53
And there really wasn't very
much emotion behind it.


90
0:4:36,53 --> 0:4:38,73
And we really didn't know how
we wanted to start to


91
0:4:38,73 --> 0:4:40,8
investigate these sounds.


92
0:4:40,8 --> 0:4:43,34
So then as it evolved, they
said, well, how about we try


93
0:4:43,34 --> 0:4:44,6
an emotional journey?


94
0:4:44,6 --> 0:4:47,72
So a week later, I came back,
and I had created this


95
0:4:47,72 --> 0:4:50,89
iteration whereby you take a
journey from the Earth out to


96
0:4:50,89 --> 0:4:54,41
the sun and back, with
sonification audio underlying


97
0:4:54,41 --> 0:4:55,66
this whole entire experience.


98
0:4:55,66 --> 0:5:2,83



99
0:5:2,83 --> 0:5:7,25
Every single piece of that music
is driven in some way,


100
0:5:7,25 --> 0:5:9,41
shape, or form by that data.


101
0:5:9,41 --> 0:5:12,62
And all of the choices in terms
of the rise and the


102
0:5:12,62 --> 0:5:15,65
fall, all of them relate back
to the underlying data.


103
0:5:15,65 --> 0:5:17,87
And all of them are true
to the data in some


104
0:5:17,87 --> 0:5:19,12
way, shape, or form.


105
0:5:19,12 --> 0:5:24,68



106
0:5:24,68 --> 0:5:26,83
Starting with one of the more
predominant things that you're


107
0:5:26,83 --> 0:5:28,89
actually hearing is
that drumbeat.


108
0:5:28,89 --> 0:5:31,54
There's a question of are there
African tribal drummers


109
0:5:31,54 --> 0:5:32,43
on the surface of the sun?


110
0:5:32,43 --> 0:5:33,84
And the answer is no.


111
0:5:33,84 --> 0:5:37,28
But if you think about a
scientific graph, there are


112
0:5:37,28 --> 0:5:38,3
hash marks.


113
0:5:38,3 --> 0:5:40,495
And you need these hash
marks to make sense.


114
0:5:40,495 --> 0:5:45,63



115
0:5:45,63 --> 0:5:49,85
What the drum beat is is it's a
sort of grandiose metronome,


116
0:5:49,85 --> 0:5:50,69
in a sense.


117
0:5:50,69 --> 0:5:52,36
And it just lets you
know where you are


118
0:5:52,36 --> 0:5:53,67
within this data set.


119
0:5:53,67 --> 0:5:55,99
So for that piece with the
drumming that's all over the


120
0:5:55,99 --> 0:5:59,46
year 2003, and the drumming
actually lets you, like every


121
0:5:59,46 --> 0:6:1,86
eight bars, that you've
gone through one full


122
0:6:1,86 --> 0:6:3,34
rotation of the sun.


123
0:6:3,34 --> 0:6:5,9
And in a sense, if you hear
something that happens at the


124
0:6:5,9 --> 0:6:8,12
beginning of the bar and then
you hear something happen


125
0:6:8,12 --> 0:6:11,3
again, similarly, at the
beginning eight bars later,


126
0:6:11,3 --> 0:6:14,8
then you know that this might be
a feature that's persisted


127
0:6:14,8 --> 0:6:16,77
across an entire solar rotation
now, and it's coming


128
0:6:16,77 --> 0:6:18,37
back in the musical form.


129
0:6:18,37 --> 0:6:21,555
And the sun then provides the
structure and can provide


130
0:6:21,555 --> 0:6:23,11
these sort of recurring
themes.


131
0:6:23,11 --> 0:6:25,57
And the drums just give
it that structure


132
0:6:25,57 --> 0:6:26,945
within which to evolve.


133
0:6:26,945 --> 0:6:32,82



134
0:6:32,82 --> 0:6:35,4
I recorded the voice of my
sister, Amanda Alexander.


135
0:6:35,4 --> 0:6:37,26
And she has a great
alto voice.


136
0:6:37,26 --> 0:6:40,68
And originally I was thinking
about these charge states of


137
0:6:40,68 --> 0:6:44,23
carbon, and the fact that as one
of them goes up, another


138
0:6:44,23 --> 0:6:45,44
one comes down.


139
0:6:45,44 --> 0:6:49,0
And so when you have a lower
voice versus a higher voice,


140
0:6:49,0 --> 0:6:51,2
there's actually more
energy pushing out


141
0:6:51,2 --> 0:6:52,36
those higher notes.


142
0:6:52,36 --> 0:6:55,27
So when I'm representing a
higher energetic state, I'm


143
0:6:55,27 --> 0:6:57,14
using a more energized voice.


144
0:6:57,14 --> 0:6:59,85
And in this way, it's kind of
appealing directly to the


145
0:6:59,85 --> 0:7:2,49
intuition of the listener in
that when you hear these


146
0:7:2,49 --> 0:7:5,86
voices get more energized,
you're at a higher energy


147
0:7:5,86 --> 0:7:7,893
level coming from the
sun, essentially.


148
0:7:7,893 --> 0:7:16,68



149
0:7:16,68 --> 0:7:18,71
I create a structure.


150
0:7:18,71 --> 0:7:20,37
I create a framework.


151
0:7:20,37 --> 0:7:23,84
And without the data driving
that framework,


152
0:7:23,84 --> 0:7:25,34
nothing takes place.


153
0:7:25,34 --> 0:7:28,82
So the structure just kind
of exists on its own.


154
0:7:28,82 --> 0:7:30,93
And then it's the data that
creates all the motion, that


155
0:7:30,93 --> 0:7:32,62
creates all the interaction,
and all the


156
0:7:32,62 --> 0:7:33,87
progression of the music.


157
0:7:33,87 --> 0:7:38,297



158
0:7:38,297 --> 0:7:41,8
SUSAN LEPRI: Initially, it
started out sort of more


159
0:7:41,8 --> 0:7:46,74
looking at the aesthetics of how
can you sonify solar wind?


160
0:7:46,74 --> 0:7:48,65
And it was a musical
sort of approach.


161
0:7:48,65 --> 0:7:51,75
But then it evolved more
into a scientific


162
0:7:51,75 --> 0:7:53,5
data analysis method.


163
0:7:53,5 --> 0:7:56,77



164
0:7:56,77 --> 0:7:59,97
When he was working with the
scientists here, Enrico Landi,


165
0:7:59,97 --> 0:8:3,23
who is, I believe, the first
author on the paper, he found


166
0:8:3,23 --> 0:8:6,53
that he could actually hear
some of the trends more


167
0:8:6,53 --> 0:8:8,47
clearly in some of
the elements.


168
0:8:8,47 --> 0:8:11,21
ROBERT ALEXANDER: I was digging
through like 20, 30


169
0:8:11,21 --> 0:8:13,58
different data parameters and
listening to them all.


170
0:8:13,58 --> 0:8:16,76
And I realized that if I
listened to carbon that I


171
0:8:16,76 --> 0:8:20,7
could hear a very strong,
harmonic presence.


172
0:8:20,7 --> 0:8:24,5
And I started to think, if I'm
hearing carbon here, but no


173
0:8:24,5 --> 0:8:25,71
one in the group has
ever really been


174
0:8:25,71 --> 0:8:26,58
talking about carbon.


175
0:8:26,58 --> 0:8:28,33
It's not really something
that they


176
0:8:28,33 --> 0:8:29,92
stress as being important.


177
0:8:29,92 --> 0:8:33,88
And yet, here, fundamentally,
this is one of the strongest


178
0:8:33,88 --> 0:8:36,7
periodic signals that I had
found up to that point.


179
0:8:36,7 --> 0:8:38,6
I'm thinking maybe this is
something worth looking into a


180
0:8:38,6 --> 0:8:39,85
little bit more.


181
0:8:39,85 --> 0:8:41,99



182
0:8:41,99 --> 0:8:46,21
We were able to figure out that,
if we use carbon, that


183
0:8:46,21 --> 0:8:49,1
we can trace the origins
of the solar wind


184
0:8:49,1 --> 0:8:50,6
with a higher accuracy.


185
0:8:50,6 --> 0:8:56,445
So we can figure out where it's
originating on the sun.


186
0:8:56,445 --> 0:9:1,91
SUSAN LEPRI: This was fairly
significant research findings


187
0:9:1,91 --> 0:9:3,76
that came out of this
audification thing.


188
0:9:3,76 --> 0:9:8,79
So it really, I think, set the
stage for Robert to do a lot


189
0:9:8,79 --> 0:9:11,635
more exciting things with the
sonification of data.


190
0:9:11,635 --> 0:9:13,695
ROBERT ALEXANDER: We wrote
everything up.


191
0:9:13,695 --> 0:9:17,23
And we said that the ear can be
an extremely powerful tool


192
0:9:17,23 --> 0:9:20,92
in the analysis of this type of
data, of time series data.


193
0:9:20,92 --> 0:9:23,51
And some people at NASA, I
guess, got excited about that.


194
0:9:23,51 --> 0:9:25,72
And they said, all right,
let's give it a shot.


195
0:9:25,72 --> 0:9:29,2
And so now I'm in the second
year of my NASA JPFP


196
0:9:29,2 --> 0:9:29,99
fellowship.


197
0:9:29,99 --> 0:9:31,97
And I spent the last summer
working at NASA Goddard.


198
0:9:31,97 --> 0:9:35,19
And I was really amazed at how
eager they all were to pick up


199
0:9:35,19 --> 0:9:36,73
the ball with sonification.


200
0:9:36,73 --> 0:9:38,6
And so it was really
invigorating to be in that


201
0:9:38,6 --> 0:9:42,79
kind of space with those kinds
of minds and to be tackling


202
0:9:42,79 --> 0:9:44,4
these kinds of ideas.


203
0:9:44,4 --> 0:9:49,93



204
0:9:49,93 --> 0:9:52,73
We forget that the most powerful
tool that we have for


205
0:9:52,73 --> 0:9:56,35
exploring the universe is right
between our two ears.


206
0:9:56,35 --> 0:9:59,49
And those same two ears
provide a wealth of


207

210
0:10:10,72 --> 0:10:11,97
understanding the universe.
