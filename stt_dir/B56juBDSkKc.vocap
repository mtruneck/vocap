###9 (# Bagpuss theme)
###31 - I'm sorry. - I'm hit !
###32 - I'm blind. - Buffy !
###48 - Amber. - Amber.
###49 - Amber. - Amber.
###51 Woof.
###72 I knew this day would come.
###74 Still. She had to go sometime.
###92 I met this girl when I was travelling,
###95 whose dad had to go to war, but he was crippled.
###98 Because she wasn't what her parents wanted,
###101 not that Amber wasn't what you wanted,
###103 but you know she was different, like a tomboy...
###105 So she stole her dad's armour
###109 and went to war instead of him
###111 and they won the war because of her.
###113 - That's Mulan. - That's her name. Do you know her ?
###116 - It's a film. - It's a Disney film. Yes.
###119 And there's a song in it...
###123 which is about how she wants to look in the mirror...
###125 # And see her real reflection #
###128 I think that's probably a bit how Amber's feeling.
###132 Like Mulan ?
###134 Yeah.
###136 Eddie Murphy does the voice of the dragon.
###138 To my mind, his third best film.
###140 Does anyone want a drink ?
###142 Phew. Bit early for that, innit ? Yeah, go on, then.
###147 I'm thinking more like a tea.
###151 Are you worried about Amber ?
###153 Nah. She's got three languages and a Dutch cap. She'll be fine. Cheers.
###160 You are so blind ! You so do not understand !
###164 You weren't there at the beginning.
###166 You don't know how good it was. How important.
###168 This is it for you.
###170 This jumped-up firework display of a toy advert.
###172 People like you make me sick. What's wrong with you ?
###175 Now, I don't care if you've saved up all your 50p's.
###179 Take your pocket money and get out !
###189 What a prick.
###193 Tim, can I have a word in my office ?
###196 Yes.
###205 Have a seat, Tim.
###209 - Twiglet ? - Better not.
###212 I was like you once.
###214 Blond hair. Scraggy little beard. Child-like ears.
###219 Full of beans and spunk.
###221 I let my principles get in the way sometimes.
###224 I punched a bloke in the face once
###226 for saying Hawk the Slayer was rubbish.
###228 - Good for you. - Thanks.
###230 But that's not the point.
###231 The point is, I was defending the fantasy genre
###234 with terminal intensity,
###236 when what I should have said is, "Dad, you're right."
###239 Let's give Krull a try and we'll discuss it later.
###242 The Phantom Menace was 18 months ago, Tim.
###246 I know, Bilbo. It just... It still hurts.
###249 That kid brought in a Jaja doll.
###251 - Kids like Jaja. - Why ?
###253 What about the Ewoks ?
###255 They were rubbish. You don't complain about them.
###257 Jaja Binks makes the Ewoks look like fucking Shaft.
###261 - I've had enough, Tim. - Bilbo.
###263 I know how you feel, I do. But this can't go on.
###266 What you trying to say ?
###268 I'm gonna have to let you go.
###271 Phew !
###276 I thought you were gonna fire me then.
###279 I was like ergh... Phew. Look at that.
###292 Right, Daisy. 0ff to work.
###294 Should be back in a couple of hours.
###296 Mike. Mike, have you got any money ?
###299 If you mean actual currency, no.
###301 I was sure I had some, but it just seems to have gone.
###305 Oh, I should, you know, get off.
###308 You didn't sort of borrow it ?
###310 You know, go through my pockets and...
###313 - Steal it ? - I'm sorry. That sounded really bad.
###316 - Did you steal it ? - No !
###319 Sorry. No, you're right. Have a nice day.
###322 Thanks.
###324 Mike, what do you do ? I've never asked.
###326 If I tell you that, I'll have to kill you.
###329 What, is it like secret ?
###331 No.
###339 Hi, Bri.
###340 - Gone. - What's gone ?
###343 - Can't paint. - Yes, you can. You're very good.
###347 Mind's just blank. Haven't painted anything in months.
###352 I don't know what's wrong.
###354 Maybe you should try approaching the canvas in different ways.
###358 I have.
###373 How do you tackle a creative block, Daisy ?
###376 Well, I'm actually very, very fortunate.
###379 I rarely suffer from writer's block.
###381 - I'm extremely prolific. - Very lucky.
###384 Yeah, I know.
###386 Have you got any money, Brian ?
###388 I've got to sign on today and I can't afford the bus fare.
###391 Can't you go to the bank ?
###393 Please, just a tenner ?
###398 I haven't got a bank account.
###400 They closed it. I'm really worried.
###403 I haven't signed on for three months
###405 and I didn't tell them I was going away.
###407 I'm sure you'll be all right. They're reasonable people.
###412 Please ! Just a tenner.
###423 Tim ?
###436 - Is everything all right ? - Yes ! Why ? !
###439 No reason.
###444 I've lost my job.
###445 What ? Why ?
###453 Not Phantom Menace.
###457 - Better go. - All right, Bri.
###459 Good luck with your blockage. Oh, a letter came for you.
###463 Thanks. Sorry about your job, Tim.
###467 Yeah. I'm sorry about your uncle, Brian.
###476 Come on, mate. It's not as if he hasn't fired you before.
###479 He's a reasonable bloke.
###481 If you talked to him you could sort it out.
###483 I don't think so. Someone's got an interview this afternoon.
###487 Well, one thing's for sure, they'll be no Tim Bisley.
###492 Well, it all seems to be in order. When can you start ?
###497 Come on, Tim. There'll be other jobs.
###499 Anyway, what about your comic ?
###502 I'm sure the comic industry's
###504 desperately in need of a giant, mutant bird
###507 with special claws.
###512 You've just got to get out there.
###515 - Yeah, well, I'm scared. - 0f what ?
###523 Nothing.
###525 Come on. I was about to go and sign on.
###528 Why don't you come with me ?
###529 - OK. - Lend me the bus fare ?
###532 - OK. - Yeah.
###535 You've got a very special talent.
###537 Sooner or later it's going to make you a lot of money.
###540 Yeah, thanks, Daisy.
###542 I wish I had another special talent to fall back on.
###558 'Dear Brian, I hope this letter finds you well
###562 'and that you're not finding being a lawyer too stressful.
###565 'Sadly, I'm writing with bad news.
###568 'Your Uncle Kevin died in his sleep last weekend
###572 'whilst driving to Staines on the M4.
###575 'We hope you can find time in your busy schedule
###577 'to come to the funeral, which is next Thursday.
###580 'Lots of love, Mum.'
###597 I'm frightened. What are you gonna say ?
###599 I'll tell 'em I was ill and start crying.
###602 - That's you. New claims. - Where ? Oh, yeah. Ok.
###606 - Good luck. - You, too.
###626 Hello. I'm Daisy Steiner.
###628 I had an appointment at 10:30. I'm late.
###634 Daisy Steiner, you must take an AB form from the stand
###636 and then join the queue.
###642 How long will I have to wait ?
###644 I'm sorry, I don't understand. Just fill out the form.
###656 How long have you been unemployed, Mr Bisley ?
###659 About an hour and a half.
###661 Have you been looking for work ?
###665 That's good. No.
###668 Why did you leave your last job ?
###670 - I got fired. - Why ?
###672 Difference of opinion.
###674 - The Phantom Menace. - Yeah.
###679 - Didn't you like it ? - No.
###684 Well, leave this with me.
###687 I'll get you some money out in the next few days.
###701 Hello.
###702 - Brian, it's me. - Hello, me.
###704 - How are you ? - Very well, thank you.
###706 - I miss you. - Miss me, too.
###711 Would you like to come out for drinks later ?
###714 - Yes, please. - 'I could stay at yours.'
###717 I'm not working tomorrow. We could stay in bed all day.
###722 So don't forget to wash your sheets.
###725 - Right. - And your penis.
###728 - OK. - 'Bye.'
###732 Bye.
###748 Ah, no. This is the Ab form. You need the AB form, capital B.
###754 But... What ?
###755 I've been here for over an hour.
###757 Just over there on the stand.
###763 Is this it ?
###768 Ok. You wanna sign on again.
###769 Yeah.
###770 You last signed on three months ago.
###772 What have you been doing since then ?
###775 I've been ill.
###780 Do you have a doctor's note ?
###783 No, I lost it.
###785 Look, this shouldn't be a problem.
###788 I just want some money.
###791 You've always given me money before.
###793 Sure you haven't been on holiday ?
###795 Me ? God, no. I couldn't afford that. Not on my income.
###808 - You... bastard ! - What can I say ? She liked me.
###812 How am I gonna pay the rent ?
###815 Just write some articles.
###816 It's not as easy as that, Tim. I can't just pluck
###819 another Winter Skin Care Dos And Don'ts out of the air.
###823 Why ?
###827 Well, maybe poverty will inspire you.
###831 It's not that bad.
###833 Mike's giving us a few quid every week.
###835 What if he wants to move out ?
###837 He doesn't at the moment. He's happy.
###840 It's not as if he's gonna get a better offer
###842 by the time we get back, is it ?
###844 Eh ?
###858 Mike, d'you mind...
###859 What are you doing ?
###860 Marsha has kindly offered me the position of lodger,
###865 which I have duly accepted.
###867 - But Mike... - No, no.
###868 You've been kind enough to let me stay,
###870 but now you're back, I should move on.
###873 But we like having you here.
###875 It'll be fine. I'm only upstairs.
###876 We can see each other every day.
###878 We'll be able to legitimately use our walkie-talkies
###881 without going to the park.
###882 - Ready then ? - With you in one second.
###886 Here he is, then. My new lodger.
###889 Hardly see the other one.
###891 Yeah, Brian's spending a lot of time with Twist.
###894 I mean, I hardly see her.
###897 I sometimes hear her.
###904 Yeah, he was up earlier on.
###906 I think he's having some kind of creative crisis.
###909 Serves him right for getting his knackers in a twist.
###912 Come on then, Mike.
###914 I'm looking forward to having a strong bloke round the house.
###917 Who's that ?
###919 - You, you pillock. - Oh, right.
###922 Oooooooh, he's funny, isn't he ?
###933 Any thoughts ?
###935 I'll have to get some new batteries for my walkie-talkie.
###938 No, about our situation.
###939 We're both unemployed.
###941 I'm getting no benefit. We need money.
###943 How else am I gonna afford aspirational magazines ?
###946 I'm gonna get a job.
###948 Why ? You've just signed on. You don't have to.
###951 I like working, Daisy.
###953 The smell of the ink, the taste of the biscuit.
###955 Giving the littl'uns advice.
###957 'People like you make me sick ! '
###961 Yeah, well. So do I. I love working.
###963 I was a barmaid once. I loved it.
###966 The hustle and bustle of a busy bar.
###969 - Can I get some service, please ? - Oh, fuck you.
###972 What can I say ? We are good with people.
###975 - Absolutely. - That's what writers do.
###977 They take unrelated jobs in order to make money
###981 and... gain experience.
###983 I temped in this office once
###986 and there were some great characters, real fodder.
###990 There was this guy Tony...
###995 Oh, what did he say ?
###1000 Anyway, that's what I'm gonna do.
###1003 Everyone does things they don't want to do sometimes.
###1007 Mike isn't doing what he wants
###1008 - but he makes the best of it. - Does he ?
###1010 Move, move !
###1013 Don't look at me ! Move !
###1015 I am gonna go to one of those temping places
###1018 and put my name down for a job.
###1020 That's the spirit. New horizons.
###1022 - Pastures green. Change. - And not the small kind.
###1027 - Why is that funny ? - I don't know.
###1031 You worked in a comic shop before ?
###1033 Yeah. The Fantasy Bazaar.
###1035 Fantasy Bazaar. That's Bilbo Bagshot's shop, isn't it ?
###1039 - Yeah. - Why'd you leave ?
###1041 - Difference of opinion. - Phantom Menace ?
###1046 Yeah. And I wanted a change.
###1049 - Ok. When can you start ? - I'm sorry ?
###1054 When can you start ?
###1059 So, what kind of work can you do ?
###1063 Sorry ?
###1065 What kind of work can you do ?
###1068 Well, I'm creative,
###1071 but I'm at home in the normal office environment.
###1076 But equally comfortable in the hustle and bustle of an eatery.
###1080 So that's anything ?
###1081 Yes, yes. Anything. I'm desperate.
###1099 - Everything all right ? - Yes, thank you, Mrs K.
###1104 Give us a shout if you need anything.
###1106 OK.
###1107 Anything at all.
###1109 Ok, then.
###1111 I like to think I'm an approachable landlady.
###1115 Ok, then.
###1119 - That's great. - So anything you want.
###1122 Just ask.
###1125 There a key to this lock ?
###1130 Hello, Brian.
###1132 Hello.
###1135 Aren't you gonna invite me in ?
###1138 - Bit busy. - Doing what ?
###1145 Nice to see you've tidied up a bit.
###1150 Thanks.
###1152 Daisy was telling me you're feeling a little dry.
###1156 Everything Ok ?
###1157 - Mmm. - Yes ?
###1162 Don't know, Marsha. Can't seem to get inspired.
###1166 Used to come so easily.
###1167 Thought I'd cracked it this morning.
###1169 Got a letter saying Uncle Kevin had died.
###1171 Next thing I knew, I was painting. Couldn't stop.
###1175 Twist called and lost it. Just went.
###1179 You know what your problem is, Brian.
###1182 What ?
###1184 You're happy.
###1187 I think you'll find
###1189 you dried up the minute you started seeing Twit.
###1193 - D'you think so ? - It's obvious.
###1197 You cannot have your cake and eat her, Brian.
###1201 Contentment is the enemy of invention.
###1206 Oh, my God.
###1207 Funny, innit ?
###1210 You were so prolific when we was at it.
###1215 - This is awful. - Innit.
###1218 - What a dilemma. - Can't believe this.
###1221 It's so depressing, Brian.
###1225 You must be really worried.
###1228 - Yes. - Angst-ridden.
###1231 - Yes. - Inconsolable.
###1236 Yes.
###1239 Right, I'm off.
###1242 Mike's cooking beans,
###1244 then we're gonna polish his guns and watch The A-Team, bye.
###1258 I love it when a plan comes together.
###1273 Hello, Silent Reading.
###1275 Yes, we do stock Jaja Binks merchandise.
###1278 Yeah, we've got him in cuddly form,
###1280 lunch box, action figure and key ring.
###1283 No problem, bye-bye.
###1287 Well done, Tim.
###1288 You've just taken your first step into a larger world.
###1292 All right, Derek.
###1296 Bilbo.
###1297 I was wondering if I could have a chat with Tim.
###1300 Certainly.
###1303 I'll put some tea on.
###1304 - Want a cup, Tim ? - Yes, please.
###1312 He should mount his collector's editions
###1314 in full view, not hide 'em away.
###1316 Man's insane.
###1318 Why'd you want to talk to me ?
###1320 So, how's it going ?
###1322 Yeah, it's all right.
###1324 - What's Derek like as a boss ? - He's Ok.
###1328 I don't really agree with his policy on vintage comic display.
###1334 Tim, I'm sorry I sacked you. It was a mistake.
###1336 Things not working out with the new guy ?
###1339 You could say that.
###1341 Hawk the Slayer's rubbish.
###1345 - I see. - Will you come back ?
###1347 Well... I like it here.
###1349 What makes you think I want to come back ?
###1351 This.
###1355 'Bilbo, this is Tim.
###1357 'Please can I come back ? I don't like it here.'
###1362 - You got that ? - I would have come in anyway.
###1365 The place is just not the same without you.
###1370 I'm already there.
###1371 What ?
###1373 I mean, I'll come back.
###1375 Oh, yeah. Yeah, you frightened me for a bit there.
###1379 I'll have to give my notice here.
###1381 Can't you just get fired ?
###1386 Derek, Babylon 5's a big pile of shit.
###1389 Get out !
###1406 I got me job back.
###1409 I got me own room.
###1412 How's Brian doing ?
###1413 He's standing in the garden with no clothes on.
###1417 - What about Daisy ? - She got a job in a bookshop.
###1420 - Think she'll be all right ? - Erm... Yeah.
###1442 Excuse me, can you point me in the direction of Personal Growth ?
###1447 Fuck you.
###1457 'S'il vous plaоt.'
