1
0:0:10,59 --> 0:0:18,53
From the fires of a sun's birth... twin planets
emerged.


2
0:0:18,53 --> 0:0:24,17
Venus... and Earth.


3
0:0:24,17 --> 0:0:37,1
Two roads diverged in our young solar system.
Nature draped one world in the greens and


4
0:0:37,1 --> 0:0:37,449
blues of life.


5
0:0:37,449 --> 0:0:47,7
While enveloping the other in acid clouds...
high heat... and volcanic flows.


6
0:0:47,7 --> 0:0:54,59
Why did Venus take such a disastrous turn?


7
0:0:54,59 --> 0:1:4,27
For as long as we have gazed upon the stars,
they have offered few signs... that somewhere


8
0:1:4,27 --> 0:1:10,28
out there... are worlds as rich and diverse
as our own.


9
0:1:10,28 --> 0:1:15,14
Recently, though, astronomers have found ways
to see into the bright lights of nearby stars.


10
0:1:15,14 --> 0:1:23,7
They've been discovering planets at a rapid
clip... using observatories like NASA's Kepler


11
0:1:23,7 --> 0:1:25,899
space telescope...


12
0:1:25,899 --> 0:1:29,31
A French observatory known as Corot ...


13
0:1:29,31 --> 0:1:35,209
...And an array of ground-based instruments.
The count is approaching 500... and rising.


14
0:1:35,209 --> 0:1:44,75
These alien worlds run the gamut... from great
gas giants many times the size of our Jupiter...


15
0:1:44,75 --> 0:1:51,49
to rocky, charred remnants that burned when
their parent star exploded.


16
0:1:51,49 --> 0:1:57,789
Some have wild elliptical orbits... swinging
far out into space... then diving into scorching


17
0:1:57,789 --> 0:2:1,179
stellar winds.


18
0:2:1,179 --> 0:2:6,319
Still others orbit so close to their parent
stars that their surfaces are likely bathed


19
0:2:6,319 --> 0:2:9,729
in molten rock.


20
0:2:9,729 --> 0:2:16,28
Amid these hostile realms, a few bear tantalizing
hints of water or ice... ingredients needed


21
0:2:16,28 --> 0:2:19,469
to nurture life as we know it.


22
0:2:19,469 --> 0:2:24,459
The race to find other Earths has raised anew
the ancient question... whether, out in the


23
0:2:24,459 --> 0:2:31,709
folds of our galaxy, planets like our own
are abundant... and life commonplace?


24
0:2:31,709 --> 0:2:38,269
Or whether Earth is a rare Garden of Eden
in a barren universe?


25
0:2:38,269 --> 0:2:42,95
With so little direct evidence of these other
worlds to go on, we have only the stories


26
0:2:42,95 --> 0:2:49,75
of planets within our own solar system to
gauge the chances of finding another Earth.


27
0:2:49,75 --> 0:2:56,65
Consider, for example, a world that has long
had the look and feel of a life-bearing planet.


28
0:2:56,65 --> 0:3:2,379
Except for the moon, there's no brighter light
in our night skies than the planet Venus...


29
0:3:2,379 --> 0:3:4,959
known as both the morning and the evening
star.


30
0:3:4,959 --> 0:3:12,29
The ancient Romans named it for their goddess
of beauty and love.


31
0:3:12,29 --> 0:3:21,2
In time, the master painters transformed this
classical symbol into an erotic figure.


32
0:3:21,2 --> 0:3:28,239
It was a scientist, Galileo Galilei, who demystified
planet Venus... charting its phases as it


33
0:3:28,239 --> 0:3:32,3
moved around the sun, drawing it into the
ranks of the other planets.


34
0:3:32,3 --> 0:3:41,18
With a similar size and weight, Venus became
known as Earth's sister planet. But how Earth-like


35
0:3:41,18 --> 0:3:43,54
is it?


36
0:3:43,54 --> 0:3:50,84
The Russian scientist Mikkhail Lomonosov caught
a tantalizing hint in 1761. As Venus passed


37
0:3:50,84 --> 0:3:56,7
in front of the Sun, he witnessed a hair thin
luminescence on its edge.


38
0:3:56,7 --> 0:4:4,68
Venus, he found, has an atmosphere.


39
0:4:4,68 --> 0:4:11,129
Later observations revealed a thick layer
of clouds. Astronomers imagined they were


40
0:4:11,129 --> 0:4:17,91
made of water vapor, like those on Earth.
Did they obscure stormy, wet conditions below?


41
0:4:17,91 --> 0:4:25,48
And did anyone, or anything, live there? The
answer came aboard an unlikely messenger....


42
0:4:25,48 --> 0:4:33,5
an asteroid that crashed into Earth.


43
0:4:33,5 --> 0:4:43,93
That is... according to the classic sci-fi
adventure, The First Spaceship on Venus. A


44
0:4:43,93 --> 0:4:48,6
mysterious computer disk is found among the
rubble.


45
0:4:48,6 --> 0:4:54,69
With


46
0:4:54,69 --> 0:5:0,21
anticipation rising on Earth, an international
crew sets off to find out who sent it... and


47
0:5:0,21 --> 0:5:1,509
why.


48
0:5:1,509 --> 0:5:18,539
Approaching Venus, the astronauts translate
the contents of the disk. The news is not


49
0:5:18,539 --> 0:5:19,15
good.


50
0:5:19,15 --> 0:5:31,919
In a desperate attempt to prevent an interplanetary
war... and save their home planet... the crew


51
0:5:31,919 --> 0:5:35,289
embarks on a dangerous mission.


52
0:5:35,289 --> 0:5:39,349
They descend to the planet's dark surface
to confront the adversaries.


53
0:5:39,349 --> 0:6:0,15
What they find is a treacherous, toxic world.


54
0:6:0,15 --> 0:6:9,19
No wonder the Venusians want to switch planets.


55
0:6:9,19 --> 0:6:18,849
It turns out that the aliens had already been
destroyed... by their own machines.


56
0:6:18,849 --> 0:6:22,129
The new rulers of Venus are not in the mood
for visitors.


57
0:6:22,129 --> 0:6:33,659
They repel the Earthlings with anti-gravity
technology.


58
0:6:33,659 --> 0:6:46,849
Unfortunately, two astronauts are left behind
to perish.


59
0:6:46,849 --> 0:6:52,99
So what if the aliens found a way to come
to Earth?


60
0:6:52,99 --> 0:6:57,56
Think Zontar, the thing from Venus.


61
0:6:57,56 --> 0:7:7,65
It was now time to get serious about exploring
our sister planet.


62
0:7:7,65 --> 0:7:11,379
BREAK


63
0:7:11,379 --> 0:7:19,46
NASA sent Mariner 2 to Venus in 1962... in
the first-ever close planetary encounter.


64
0:7:19,46 --> 0:7:24,379
Its instruments showed that Venus is nothing
at all like Earth. Rather, it's extremely


65
0:7:24,379 --> 0:7:28,47
hot, with an atmosphere made up mostly of
carbon dioxide.


66
0:7:28,47 --> 0:7:36,689
The data showed that Venus rotates very slowly...
only once every 243 Earth days... and it goes


67
0:7:36,689 --> 0:7:38,58
in the opposite direction.


68
0:7:38,58 --> 0:7:44,419
American and Soviet scientists found out just
how strange Venus is when they sent a series


69
0:7:44,419 --> 0:7:47,55
of landers down to take direct readings.


70
0:7:47,55 --> 0:7:53,9
Surface temperatures are almost 900 degrees
Fahrenheit, hot enough to melt lead, with


71
0:7:53,9 --> 0:7:57,889
the air pressure 90 times higher than at sea
level on Earth.


72
0:7:57,889 --> 0:8:6,479
The air is so thick that it's not a gas, but
a "supercritical fluid." Liquid CO2.


73
0:8:6,479 --> 0:8:7,759
On our planet, the only naturally occurring
source is in the high-temperature, high-pressure


74
0:8:7,759 --> 0:8:10,629
environments of undersea volcanoes. It comes
in handy for extracting caffeine from coffee


75
0:8:10,629 --> 0:8:12,8
beans... or dry cleaning our clothes.


76
0:8:12,8 --> 0:8:18,479
You just wouldn't want to have to breathe
it.


77
0:8:18,479 --> 0:8:25,36
The


78
0:8:25,36 --> 0:8:31,61
Soviet Venera landers sent back pictures showing
that Venus is a vast garden of rock, with


79
0:8:31,61 --> 0:8:35,229
no water in sight.


80
0:8:35,229 --> 0:8:40,9
In fact, if you were to smooth out the surface
of Venus, all the water in the atmosphere


81
0:8:40,9 --> 0:8:43,15
would be just 3 centimeters deep.


82
0:8:43,15 --> 0:8:51,5
Compare that to Earth... where the oceans
would form a layer 3 kilometers deep.


83
0:8:51,5 --> 0:8:56,52
If you could land on Venus, you'd be treated
to tranquil vistas and sunset skies, painted


84
0:8:56,52 --> 0:8:58,61
in orange hues.


85
0:8:58,61 --> 0:9:4,29
The winds are light, only a few miles per
hour... but the air is so thick that a breeze


86
0:9:4,29 --> 0:9:6,99
would knock you over.


87
0:9:6,99 --> 0:9:15,29
Look up and you'd see fast-moving clouds...
streaking around the planet at 300 kilometers


88
0:9:15,29 --> 0:9:24,14
per hour. These clouds form a dense high-altitude
layer, from 45 to 66 kilometers above the


89
0:9:24,14 --> 0:9:24,82
surface.


90
0:9:24,82 --> 0:9:30,82
The clouds are so dense and reflective that
Venus absorbs much less solar energy than


91
0:9:30,82 --> 0:9:33,71
Earth, even though it's 30% closer to the
Sun.


92
0:9:33,71 --> 0:9:41,12
These clouds curve around into a pair of immense
planetary hurricanes as the air spirals down


93
0:9:41,12 --> 0:9:43,6
into the cooler polar regions.


94
0:9:43,6 --> 0:9:50,29
They are made up mostly of sulfuric acid droplets...
possibly a bi-product of sulfur dioxide emitted


95
0:9:50,29 --> 0:9:52,17
by volcanoes.


96
0:9:52,17 --> 0:9:58,19
Along the equator, they rise in powerful storms,
unleashing bolts of lightning.


97
0:9:58,19 --> 0:10:4,6
Just like earth, these storms produce rain...
only it's acid rain that evaporates before


98
0:10:4,6 --> 0:10:5,82
it hits the ground.


99
0:10:5,82 --> 0:10:13,2
At higher elevations, a fine mist forms...
not of water but of the rare metal tellurium...


100
0:10:13,2 --> 0:10:16,8
and iron pyrites... known as fool's gold.


101
0:10:16,8 --> 0:10:24,94
It can form a metallic frost... like snowflakes
in hell.


102
0:10:24,94 --> 0:10:29,64
Still, the mountains of Venus offer no relief
from the heat. They are part of what makes


103
0:10:29,64 --> 0:10:34,2
Venus so extreme.


104
0:10:34,2 --> 0:10:40,7
Scientists have identified around 1700 major
volcanic centers on Venus ranging from lava


105
0:10:40,7 --> 0:10:49,5
domes... and strange features called arachnoids
or coronae... to giant volcanic summits.


106
0:10:49,5 --> 0:10:54,98
The planet is peppered with volcanoes, perhaps
in the millions, distributed randomly on its


107
0:10:54,98 --> 0:11:1,37
surface. Venus is run through with huge cuts
thousands of kilometers long that may well


108
0:11:1,37 --> 0:11:4,51
be lava channels.


109
0:11:4,51 --> 0:11:13,12
Our sister planet is a volcanic paradise,
in a solar system shaped by volcanism.


110
0:11:13,12 --> 0:11:20,27
The largest mountain on Earth, Hawaii's Mauna
Kea volcano, measures 32,000 feet from sea


111
0:11:20,27 --> 0:11:22,26
floor to summit.


112
0:11:22,26 --> 0:11:32,89
Rising almost three times higher is the mother
of all volcanoes: Olympus Mons on Mars.


113
0:11:32,89 --> 0:11:40,2
Jupiter's moon Io... is bleeding lava. It's
produced deep underground by the friction


114
0:11:40,2 --> 0:11:42,7
of rock on rock, caused by the gravitational
pull of its mother planet.


115
0:11:42,7 --> 0:11:49,15
Then there's Neptune's moon Triton... with
crystals of nitrogen ice shooting some 10


116
0:11:49,15 --> 0:11:53,0
kilometers above the surface.


117
0:11:53,0 --> 0:11:58,48
Saturn's moon Titan... with frozen liquid
methane and ammonia oozing into lakes and


118
0:11:58,48 --> 0:12:0,98
swamps.


119
0:12:0,98 --> 0:12:6,57
On our planet, volcanoes commonly form at
the margins of continents and oceans, where


120
0:12:6,57 --> 0:12:12,73
steep mountainsides fall off into deep undersea
trenches. Here, the vast slabs of rock that


121
0:12:12,73 --> 0:12:18,5
underlie the oceans push beneath those that
bear the continents.


122
0:12:18,5 --> 0:12:24,33
Deep underground, friction between these plates
can melt vast amounts of rock.


123
0:12:24,33 --> 0:12:31,55
Magma mixes with water... and the rising pressure
forces it up... in explosive eruptions.


124
0:12:31,55 --> 0:12:37,45
On Earth, volcanoes can blast into the upper
atmosphere, in a hail of ash, rock, dust,


125
0:12:37,45 --> 0:12:41,23
and lava.


126
0:12:41,23 --> 0:12:49,98
On Venus, the scene is very different. In
the high-density atmosphere, volcanoes are


127
0:12:49,98 --> 0:12:56,89
more likely to ooze and splatter... sending
rivers of lava flowing down onto the lowlands.


128
0:12:56,89 --> 0:13:3,5
They resemble volcanoes that form at hot spots
like the Hawaiian islands. There, plumes of


129
0:13:3,5 --> 0:13:8,91
magma rise up from deep within the earth,
releasing the pressure in a stream of eruptions.


130
0:13:8,91 --> 0:13:18,62
To see a typical large volcano on Venus, go
to Sappas Mons... at 400 kilometers across


131
0:13:18,62 --> 0:13:22,2
and 1.5 kilometers high.


132
0:13:22,2 --> 0:13:27,62
The mountain was likely built through eruptions
at its summit. But as magma reached up from


133
0:13:27,62 --> 0:13:33,48
below, it began to drain out through subsurface
tubes or cracks that formed a web of channels


134
0:13:33,48 --> 0:13:37,53
leading onto the surrounding terrain.


135
0:13:37,53 --> 0:13:43,66
Is Venus, like Earth, still volcanically active?


136
0:13:43,66 --> 0:13:49,3
Finding the answer is a major goal of the
Venus Express mission, launched in 2005 by


137
0:13:49,3 --> 0:13:55,58
the European Space Agency. Armed with a new
generation of high-tech sensors, it peered


138
0:13:55,58 --> 0:13:57,11
through the clouds.


139
0:13:57,11 --> 0:14:2,29
Recording the infrared light given off by
several large mountains, it found that the


140
0:14:2,29 --> 0:14:7,48
summits are brighter than the surrounding
basins. That's probably because they had not


141
0:14:7,48 --> 0:14:12,18
been subject to as much weathering in this
corrosive environment.


142
0:14:12,18 --> 0:14:18,7
This means that they would have erupted sometime
within the last few hundred thousand years.


143
0:14:18,7 --> 0:14:24,12
If these volcanoes are active now, it's because
they are part of a deeper process that shapes


144
0:14:24,12 --> 0:14:28,76
our planet as well.


145
0:14:28,76 --> 0:14:34,56
On Earth, the release of heat from radioactive
decay deep in its mantle is what drives the


146
0:14:34,56 --> 0:14:37,67
motion of oceanic and continental plates.


147
0:14:37,67 --> 0:14:45,1
This process is dependent on erosion and other
processes associated with water.


148
0:14:45,1 --> 0:14:51,2
With no water on Venus, the planet's internal
heat builds to extreme levels, then escapes


149
0:14:51,2 --> 0:14:54,3
in outbreaks of volcanism that may be global
in scope.


150
0:14:54,3 --> 0:15:1,16
That may explain why fewer than a thousand
impact craters have been found on Venus. Anything


151
0:15:1,16 --> 0:15:7,45
older than about 500 million years has literally
been paved over.


152
0:15:7,45 --> 0:15:12,83
So why did Venus diverge so radically from
Earth when it was born in same solar system


153
0:15:12,83 --> 0:15:14,88
and under similar circumstances?


154
0:15:14,88 --> 0:15:16,42
BREAK


155
0:15:16,42 --> 0:15:21,49
There is growing evidence, still circumstantial,
that Venus may in fact have had a wetter,


156
0:15:21,49 --> 0:15:23,1
more Earth-like past.


157
0:15:23,1 --> 0:15:29,73
One of the most startling findings of the
early Venus missions was the presence of deuterium,


158
0:15:29,73 --> 0:15:36,68
a form of hydrogen, in Venus' upper atmosphere.
It forms when ultraviolet sunlight breaks


159
0:15:36,68 --> 0:15:38,32
apart water molecules.


160
0:15:38,32 --> 0:15:46,93
Additional evidence recently came to light.
Venus Express trained its infrared sensors


161
0:15:46,93 --> 0:15:52,18
on the planet's night side... to look at how
the terrain emits the energy captured in the


162
0:15:52,18 --> 0:15:55,72
heat of the day.


163
0:15:55,72 --> 0:16:2,25
This picture is a composite of over a thousand
individual images of Venus' southern hemisphere.


164
0:16:2,25 --> 0:16:8,58
Higher elevation areas, shown in blue, emit
less heat than the surrounding basins.


165
0:16:8,58 --> 0:16:16,64
That supports a hypothesis that these areas
are made not of lava, but of granite.


166
0:16:16,64 --> 0:16:23,55
On Earth, granite forms in volcanoes when
magma mixes with water. If there's granite


167
0:16:23,55 --> 0:16:29,62
on Venus, then there may well have been water.


168
0:16:29,62 --> 0:16:34,74
If Earth and Venus emerged together as twin
blue marbles... then at some point, the two


169
0:16:34,74 --> 0:16:36,3
worlds parted company.


170
0:16:36,3 --> 0:16:43,49
Earth developed ways to moderate its climate,
in part by removing carbon dioxide, a greenhouse


171
0:16:43,49 --> 0:16:49,8
gas, from its atmosphere.


172
0:16:49,8 --> 0:16:57,19
Plants, for one, absorb CO2 and release oxygen
in photosynthesis. One square kilometer of


173
0:16:57,19 --> 0:17:5,49
tropical jungle, for example, can take in
several hundred tons of co2 in just a year.


174
0:17:5,49 --> 0:17:10,809
That's nothing compared to the oceans. In
a year's time, according to one recent study,


175
0:17:10,809 --> 0:17:16,449
just one square kilometer of ocean can absorb
41 million tons of CO2.


176
0:17:16,449 --> 0:17:25,309
Earth takes in its own share of CO2. When
rainfall interacts with rocks, a chemical


177
0:17:25,309 --> 0:17:32,509
reaction known as "weathering" converts atmospheric
CO2 to carbonate compounds. Runoff from the


178
0:17:32,509 --> 0:17:38,6
land washes it into rivers and the seas...
where they settle into ocean sediments.


179
0:17:38,6 --> 0:17:44,48
To understand how much this can influence
the climate, look back into Earth's history.


180
0:17:44,48 --> 0:17:49,61
The formation of the Himalayan Mountains and
the Tibetan Plateau around 50 million years


181
0:17:49,61 --> 0:17:54,95
ago exposed massive amounts of rock... and
led to an increase in rainfall.


182
0:17:54,95 --> 0:18:3,39
Over time, so much CO2 was removed from the
atmosphere through weathering that it sent


183
0:18:3,39 --> 0:18:11,19
Earth into a period of global cooling that
has lasted to this day.


184
0:18:11,19 --> 0:18:17,809
With little water and no oceans, Venus has
no good way to remove CO2 from its atmosphere.


185
0:18:17,809 --> 0:18:23,82
Instead, with volcanic eruptions adding more
and more CO2 to the atmosphere, it has trapped


186
0:18:23,82 --> 0:18:29,429
more and more of the sun's heat in a runaway
greenhouse effect.


187
0:18:29,429 --> 0:18:34,96
Venus is so hot that liquid water simply cannot
survive on the surface.


188
0:18:34,96 --> 0:18:40,669
Nor, it now seems, can it last in the upper
atmosphere.


189
0:18:40,669 --> 0:18:47,169
As our solar system moves around the galaxy,
it is lashed by a fierce wind of charged particles.


190
0:18:47,169 --> 0:18:52,11
The sun blocks this galactic wind with a powerful
solar wind.


191
0:18:52,11 --> 0:18:57,769
It reaches its peak in the wake of great looping
eruptions on the surface of the Sun, called


192
0:18:57,769 --> 0:18:59,549
coronal mass ejections.


193
0:18:59,549 --> 0:19:4,19
Fortunately, Earth has its own line of defense.


194
0:19:4,19 --> 0:19:9,74
Plumes of hot magma rise and fall in Earth's
core as it spins, generating a magnetic field


195
0:19:9,74 --> 0:19:11,509
that extends far out into space.


196
0:19:11,509 --> 0:19:18,9
It acts as a shield, deflecting the solar
wind and causing it to flow past.


197
0:19:18,9 --> 0:19:23,49
It's this protective bubble that Venus lacks.


198
0:19:23,49 --> 0:19:27,559
Venus Express found that these solar winds
are steadily stripping off lighter molecules


199
0:19:27,559 --> 0:19:34,25
of hydrogen and oxygen. They escape the planet
on the night side... then ride solar breezes


200
0:19:34,25 --> 0:19:35,57
on out into space.


201
0:19:35,57 --> 0:19:43,9
All this may be due to Venus' size... 80%
that of Earth. This prevents the formation


202
0:19:43,9 --> 0:19:48,47
of a solid iron core... and with it the rising
and falling plumes that generate a strong


203
0:19:48,47 --> 0:19:50,309
magnetic field.


204
0:19:50,309 --> 0:19:57,169
There may be another reason too... according
to a theory about the planet's early years.


205
0:19:57,169 --> 0:20:2,83
A young planet Venus encountered one or more
planet-sized objects... in violent collisions.


206
0:20:2,83 --> 0:20:12,509
The force of these impacts slowed its rotation
to a crawl... and reversed it... reducing


207
0:20:12,509 --> 0:20:17,23
the chances that a magnetic field could take
hold.


208
0:20:17,23 --> 0:20:22,59
This does not mean that Venus was Earth-like.
Another theory holds that the planet's primordial


209
0:20:22,59 --> 0:20:28,36
oceans were actually held as vapor in its
atmosphere... and replenished by icy comets


210
0:20:28,36 --> 0:20:33,47
in the early years of the solar system.


211
0:20:33,47 --> 0:20:37,12
So what can we glean from the evolution of
planet Venus?


212
0:20:37,12 --> 0:20:43,499
For one thing, as we continue to scan the
cosmic horizons for worlds that may resemble


213
0:20:43,499 --> 0:20:48,679
our own, the story of Venus will stand as
a stark reminder.


214
0:20:48,679 --> 0:20:55,999
It takes more than just the right size, composition,
and distance from the parent star... for a


215
0:20:55,999 --> 0:20:59,409
planet to become truly Earth-like.


216
0:20:59,409 --> 0:21:6,649
No matter how promising a planet may be, there
are myriad forces out there that can radically


217
0:21:6,649 --> 0:21:8,409
alter its course.


218
0:21:8,409 --> 0:21:16,62
For here was a world... Venus... poised perhaps
on the brink of a glorious future.


219
0:21:16,62 --> 0:21:25,879
But bad luck passed its way. Now, we can only
imagine... what might have become of Earth's


220
0:21:25,879 --> 0:21:26,509
sister planet?


221
0:21:26,509 --> 0:23:26,509
