###2 JACOB SOBOROFF: For the past three years,
###4 the Egyptian revolution has been a roller coaster.
###7 Two presidents have been deposed, thousands of people
###9 have died, and just yesterday, the prime minister abruptly
###12 resigned his government. "The Square"
###13 is a newly-released documentary that gives a street-level look
###16 at the ongoing revolution since 2011.

###28 JACOB SOBOROFF: It's up for an Oscar this Sunday.
###30 And we've got the filmmaker Jehane and the producer Karim
###32 right here.
###33 Hi, guys.
###33 JEHANE NOUJAIM: Hey, what's up?
###33 KARIM AMER: How are you doing, YouTube?
###34 JACOB SOBOROFF: Guys, tell us about the challenges
###36 of making a film like this.
###37 JEHANE NOUJAIM: All of us got either arrested, tear gassed,
###39 shot at at various points in the making of the film.
###42 JACOB SOBOROFF: When they first debuted the movie at Sundance,
###43 it wasn't even reallt done, right?
###44 JEHANE NOUJAIM: It was a work in progress,
###45 and we promised all of our characters
###47 that we would go back and continue filming.
###49 Because we had a very neat story from the bringing
###51 down of a dictator to the election of a president.
###53 But the story wasn't over, because all of our characters,
###56 when we were on the way to Sundance,
###57 were back in the streets again, basically saying,
###60 this newly-elected president, first freely-elected president
###63 of Egypt, is using the tools of democracy
###65 to create another dictatorship.

###72 JACOB SOBOROFF: So these guys just put the movie on YouTube
###74 for the people in Egypt.
###75 What motivated that, and how does it work exactly?
###77 KARIM AMER: YouTube was an integral part
###78 of this revolution.
###79 When you live in a country where the media is in full control
###82 and is lying about what's happening on the ground,
###84 our young activists used YouTube as their own channel
###87 to spread their stores.
###88 AHMED HASSAN: [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###89 
###99 JACOB SOBOROFF: Obviously, right now there's
###100 protests in Venezuela, unrest in the Ukraine.
###103 Why now is this time important for people to see this film,
###105 do you think?
###106 JEHANE NOUJAIM: What these kids are fighting
###108 for is what this country was founded on,
###110 which is civil liberties and freedom
###111 of expression and human rights.
###113 I mean, it's the civil rights struggle of our time.
###115 And that's what's happening in Egypt
###117 right now as they're being silenced.
###119 And so releasing this film now and the support
###121 of the international community makes it
###123 so that it's not just a lonely fight of protesters
###126 on the frontlines in Egypt.
###127 It makes it a global fight.
###129 AHMED HASSAN: [SPEAKING ARABIC]

###132 JACOB SOBOROFF: Jehane's the only female director
###135 nominated for an Oscar this year.
###136 Where can people see this movie?
###138 JEHANE NOUJAIM: Well, you can see it
###139 on Netflix in 47 countries, including the US.
###141 And also internationally, you can see it
###144 by going to our YouTube site.
###146 JACOB SOBOROFF: Thank you so much to these guys.
###147 We've put together a playlist with moments of triumph
###149 from Tahrir Square.
###150 You could see that after the show.
