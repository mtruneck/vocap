###8 MITT ROMNEY: I think marijuana should not be
###9 legal in this country.
###10 I believe it's a gateway drug to other drug violations.
###15 The use of the illegal drugs in this country is leading to
###18 terrible consequences.
###20 
###24 SHANE SMITH: Now we all know Mitt Romney's stance on drugs,
###26 but it was interesting to hear Kelly's thoughts on the drug
###28 war, considering it affects him every day.
###31 KELLY ROMNEY: To me, this used to be the most peaceful place
###34 in the world.
###35 I used let my kids go to [SPANISH], go to the shows, go
###39 to dances, go to parties.
###41 But now you keep a close watch.
###44 And it all has to do with the drug
###46 violence that has started.
###47 When they started the war on drugs, the
###51 violence just escalated.
###53 Most of the problems that we have around
###55 here are drug related.
###57 And there's been some kidnappings and some killings
###60 from drug related things.
###63 SHANE SMITH: Have there ever been any Romneys kidnapped?
###66 KELLY ROMNEY: Yeah, my brother was kidnapped three
###68 years ago in May.
###70 I think they kept him for two days, took him to a cave up in
###73 the mountains.
###74 We paid a small ransom.
###75 It wasn't a lot.
###76 They were mainly punks.
###78 They weren't really professionals.
###80 SHANE SMITH: And most of the weapons that are here in
###83 Mexico are illegal weapons.
###85 And most of those illegal weapons are
###87 coming from the states.
###88 KELLY ROMNEY: Yes.
###89 Fast and Furious, I'm sure you've heard about that?
###92 SHANE SMITH: Now, the Fast and the Furious scandal he's
###95 talking about refers to a case where the American government
###98 gave thousands of guns to the cartels in
###100 order to track them.
###102 Then they proceeded to lose track of them until they
###104 surfaced again in the murder cases of American agents.
###108 KELLY ROMNEY: What, they think that we're going to be able to
###109 keep control of them or keep track of them?
###111 Nonsense.
###112 I don't know what in the world they were thinking sending all
###115 those weapons to Mexico.
###118 SHANE SMITH: And the Fast and the Furious scandal is just
###120 one of many that have seriously embarrassed the
###122 American government.
###124 Now, perhaps, Mitt's hard line stance on issues like guns,
###127 immigration, and drugs becomes more clear.
###130 Because even though his father was born in Chihuahua, Mitt
###133 surely must want to distance himself from the region,
###135 because the region is totally fucked up.
###138 And it's not the first time this has been the Romney
###141 strategy, either.
###142 When his father ran for president, both his
###144 citizenship and his Mormon colony's polygamist roots were
###147 called into question.
###149 And his run for the White House didn't last too long.
###152 But Mitt Romney has to deal with his family's polygamist
###155 past, kidnapping, drug wars, and in the extreme case of
###159 Ervil LeBaron, crazy Mormon blood atonement.
###163 Now, having close familial ties to all of this shit does
###166 not a good presidential candidate make.
###168 
###171 Being on the front lines of this, what do you think are
###174 some of solutions to these problems?
###176 KELLY ROMNEY: Looking at it from a perspective of someone
###178 living here, we say, well, why don't they legalize it in the
###181 United States and cut out all of violence in Mexico?
###183 SHANE SMITH: Sure.
###185 KELLY ROMNEY: As long as you have the swimming pool over
###187 there, this is going to be the diving board.
###189 
###195 SHANE SMITH: So as we began our long drive back to the
###197 border, I had lots of time to think about what
###199 we'd seen in Chihuahua.
###201 I thought about the LeBarons and the war against the
###203 narcos, the kidnapping and murders, and the length they
###206 have to go to protect themselves every day.
###209 I also thought about what Kelly Romney had said about
###212 the US being the swimming pool and Mexico being the diving
###214 board, and how similar all this is to America's history
###218 with outlawing alcohol.
###219 
###223 So we're just approaching the border here back into America.
###226 Feels like about a year has passed since were here last.
###230 As we were driving here from Chihuahua, I was thinking how
###234 prohibition in America led to the rise of the mob, the Al
###236 Capones, the Lucky Lucianos.
###238 Our war on drugs, our prohibition against drugs, has
###241 caused the same thing.
###242 You see it down here.
###243 It's the blunt end of the hammer.
###245 It's rule of the thug.
###246 You have $200 assassins.
###248 And as long as there's prohibition,
###249 it's going to continue.
###251 The war on drugs is a failure.
###253 There have never been more drugs in America and they've
###254 never been cheaper or better or higher quality.
###258 And as we sat for hours at the border, waiting to get back
###260 into America, I thought about the fact that Mitt Romney
###263 might just be the next president
###264 of the United States.
###265 MITT ROMNEY: God bless America.
###267 Thank you guys.
###268 SHANE SMITH: Now, polygamy and kidnapping not withstanding,
###271 if he wins, he's going to have some hard decisions to make
###274 about decriminalizing drugs and fixing
###276 our immigration problem.
###278 Because if he doesn't, Mexico, his Mormon brethren, and
###281 perhaps even his own flesh and blood are
###284 going to pay the price.
