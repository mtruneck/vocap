0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:2,784



2
0:0:2,784 --> 0:0:4,913
JEFF OGIBA: I like the
frog on the mushroom.


3
0:0:4,913 --> 0:0:4,98
DAN SANTORO: Yeah.


4
0:0:4,98 --> 0:0:6,16
I love that one too, man.


5
0:0:6,16 --> 0:0:8,308
I would really like to do that,
to be honest with you.


6
0:0:8,308 --> 0:0:9,61
JEFF OGIBA: Who tagged
all these?


7
0:0:9,61 --> 0:0:11,8
How big would you make that?


8
0:0:11,8 --> 0:0:11,73
DAN SANTORO: I'd do
probably like--


9
0:0:11,73 --> 0:0:11,835
JEFF OGIBA: Just a little one?


10
0:0:11,835 --> 0:0:12,45
DAN SANTORO: Yeah.


11
0:0:12,45 --> 0:0:13,19
Like that more, you know?


12
0:0:13,19 --> 0:0:13,44
JEFF OGIBA: Like here?


13
0:0:13,44 --> 0:0:14,1
DAN SANTORO: Yeah.


14
0:0:14,1 --> 0:0:15,49
I think that's a good spot
for it, actually.


15
0:0:15,49 --> 0:0:16,31
JEFF OGIBA: I don't know.


16
0:0:16,31 --> 0:0:17,13
So I don't know.


17
0:0:17,13 --> 0:0:19,56
DAN SANTORO: Oh, I
love that frog.


18
0:0:19,56 --> 0:0:19,92
JEFF OGIBA: Well--


19
0:0:19,92 --> 0:0:20,61
DAN SANTORO: What do you want?


20
0:0:20,61 --> 0:0:22,78
Fucking like American
flag rip-out?


21
0:0:22,78 --> 0:0:23,87
Jesus Christ.


22
0:0:23,87 --> 0:0:25,23
Everything I do is silly.


23
0:0:25,23 --> 0:0:26,26
JEFF OGIBA: What does
it say, though?


24
0:0:26,26 --> 0:0:29,19
DAN SANTORO: It says that you
like fucking Bluegrass.


25
0:0:29,19 --> 0:0:30,55
You don't mind amphibians.


26
0:0:30,55 --> 0:0:32,235
And you definitely get high.


27
0:0:32,235 --> 0:0:41,566
[MUSIC PLAYING]


28
0:0:41,566 --> 0:0:45,69
DAN SANTORO: I think this is an
interesting design, simply


29
0:0:45,69 --> 0:0:50,49
because it's not like some
kind of famous thing.


30
0:0:50,49 --> 0:0:53,25
It's not like some kind
of iconic graphic.


31
0:0:53,25 --> 0:0:55,77
It's not like a Gibson girl
or something like that.


32
0:0:55,77 --> 0:0:57,78
But you know it was pulled off
of something, which I think is


33
0:0:57,78 --> 0:0:59,19
really interesting.


34
0:0:59,19 --> 0:1:0,95
It might have been pulled
off of a candy


35
0:1:0,95 --> 0:1:3,882
wrapper or a cereal box.


36
0:1:3,882 --> 0:1:7,49
I think that's really cool.


37
0:1:7,49 --> 0:1:9,13
In the beginning, we didn't
know how to make


38
0:1:9,13 --> 0:1:12,23
a good tattoo design.


39
0:1:12,23 --> 0:1:13,0
Neither of us did.


40
0:1:13,0 --> 0:1:14,96
Right, Jeff?


41
0:1:14,96 --> 0:1:17,35
Jeff is a long-time
friend of mine.


42
0:1:17,35 --> 0:1:19,13
We went to high school
together.


43
0:1:19,13 --> 0:1:22,4
I learned by doing a bunch of
really shitty tattoos on him.


44
0:1:22,4 --> 0:1:25,39
Like in the very beginning,
he wanted to just get line


45
0:1:25,39 --> 0:1:27,61
drawings and hardcore
band things.


46
0:1:27,61 --> 0:1:32,27
But now, yeah, he just wants to
get really funny, goofies.


47
0:1:32,27 --> 0:1:34,52
It's goofy, but at the same,
sort of like mystical stuff.


48
0:1:34,52 --> 0:1:35,62
That's what he's into.


49
0:1:35,62 --> 0:1:37,7
I just wanted to do a tiger
on his forearm.


50
0:1:37,7 --> 0:1:40,23
And he convinced me to do a
tiger on a flying carpet


51
0:1:40,23 --> 0:1:44,785
jumping through atom symbols
and like the galaxy and all


52
0:1:44,785 --> 0:1:45,35
this stuff like that.


53
0:1:45,35 --> 0:1:47,12
And normally, that would
be a terrible idea.


54
0:1:47,12 --> 0:1:48,89
But it works on him.


55
0:1:48,89 --> 0:1:51,72
And I think I did a pretty
good job on that one.


56
0:1:51,72 --> 0:1:56,18
He's just one of those people
that, no matter what I do or


57
0:1:56,18 --> 0:1:58,35
do to him, it's all good.


58
0:1:58,35 --> 0:2:1,19
We're friends, you know?


59
0:2:1,19 --> 0:2:3,77
My wife and him were just having
a conversation about,


60
0:2:3,77 --> 0:2:6,86
potentially, in the future,
opening up a record store.


61
0:2:6,86 --> 0:2:10,259
And then, within six months,
we had the grand opening.


62
0:2:10,259 --> 0:2:14,21
So it was just a really cool
thing, because it's like a


63
0:2:14,21 --> 0:2:16,66
pipe dream that every kid has
with their best friend when


64
0:2:16,66 --> 0:2:17,63
you're in high school.


65
0:2:17,63 --> 0:2:19,3
When we're older, we're
going to have a


66
0:2:19,3 --> 0:2:20,62
record store one day.


67
0:2:20,62 --> 0:2:23,11
And half the people don't even
talk to their friends from


68
0:2:23,11 --> 0:2:24,22
that time period any more.


69
0:2:24,22 --> 0:2:26,26
And here we are,
grown ass men.


70
0:2:26,26 --> 0:2:29,27
And we have a record store.


71
0:2:29,27 --> 0:2:32,42
Sommer is usually the face
of this place, up


72
0:2:32,42 --> 0:2:33,42
front making coffee.


73
0:2:33,42 --> 0:2:35,35
Jeff is the record guy.


74
0:2:35,35 --> 0:2:37,46
And I do the antique
stuff, when I can.


75
0:2:37,46 --> 0:2:39,69
JEFF OGIBA: We all do a little
bit of everything.


76
0:2:39,69 --> 0:2:44,0
I end up in piles of records
mostly, dealing with weirdos,


77
0:2:44,0 --> 0:2:48,23
taking phone calls, going out
to visit people who--


78
0:2:48,23 --> 0:2:49,29
DAN SANTORO: Try and rob you.


79
0:2:49,29 --> 0:2:50,198
SOMMER SANTORO: [LAUGHS]


80
0:2:50,198 --> 0:2:53,42
-What are some indicators that
it's going to be a good buy?


81
0:2:53,42 --> 0:2:55,66
JEFF OGIBA: These
are my uncle's.


82
0:2:55,66 --> 0:2:57,355
And he just overdosed
on heroin.


83
0:2:57,355 --> 0:2:58,53
[LAUGHTER]


84
0:2:58,53 --> 0:2:58,91
DAN SANTORO: Yeah.


85
0:2:58,91 --> 0:3:0,97
That's usually a good
sign, right?


86
0:3:0,97 --> 0:3:2,9
Johnny Thunders got
you into heroin.


87
0:3:2,9 --> 0:3:4,45
You know?


88
0:3:4,45 --> 0:3:6,62
Sinatra did not, you know?


89
0:3:6,62 --> 0:3:8,115
JEFF OGIBA: Soon as you hear a
little bit of the history, you


90
0:3:8,115 --> 0:3:10,785
know right away that
there's a chance.


91
0:3:10,785 --> 0:3:12,735
DAN SANTORO: I had a guy come
in here with a bunch of


92
0:3:12,735 --> 0:3:13,63
antique medical charts.


93
0:3:13,63 --> 0:3:14,63
He was a teacher.


94
0:3:14,63 --> 0:3:19,13
And they were in the facility
closet of the science lab.


95
0:3:19,13 --> 0:3:21,5
And he had taken them 20
years ago or something.


96
0:3:21,5 --> 0:3:22,71
And they were probably
sitting in there for


97
0:3:22,71 --> 0:3:24,6
60 years, you know?


98
0:3:24,6 --> 0:3:25,83
Again, someone that's going to
do that is kind of weird.


99
0:3:25,83 --> 0:3:26,39
But I like that.


100
0:3:26,39 --> 0:3:28,8
Those are my people,
really, you know?


101
0:3:28,8 --> 0:3:30,25
[LAUGHS]


102
0:3:30,25 --> 0:3:31,726
That's my nationality.


103
0:3:31,726 --> 0:3:32,48
[LAUGHS]


104
0:3:32,48 --> 0:3:35,1
I grew up in a relatively
old house.


105
0:3:35,1 --> 0:3:37,12
And my father actually used
to have a military store.


106
0:3:37,12 --> 0:3:39,23
My father was a World War II
collector, specifically


107
0:3:39,23 --> 0:3:41,15
Italian Fascist stuff.


108
0:3:41,15 --> 0:3:44,7
And then he also dealt
in a little German.


109
0:3:44,7 --> 0:3:45,28
And they had that
for a few years.


110
0:3:45,28 --> 0:3:47,36
And then, when they closed it
down, they brought everything


111
0:3:47,36 --> 0:3:48,0
into the house.


112
0:3:48,0 --> 0:3:50,23
So it was like the scariest
thing ever.


113
0:3:50,23 --> 0:3:53,26
I used to go down to try
to work on models.


114
0:3:53,26 --> 0:3:57,45
And there'd be two full dressed
Black Brigade soldiers


115
0:3:57,45 --> 0:3:58,62
standing next to me.


116
0:3:58,62 --> 0:4:0,69
It was a weird situation
to grow up in.


117
0:4:0,69 --> 0:4:2,52
But it was pretty
normal to me.


118
0:4:2,52 --> 0:4:4,31
And I actually really loved the
fact that that was kind of


119
0:4:4,31 --> 0:4:5,46
normal to my parents.


120
0:4:5,46 --> 0:4:6,37
So it's funny.


121
0:4:6,37 --> 0:4:8,47
Some people walk through the
doors here and they're just


122
0:4:8,47 --> 0:4:12,29
hit in the face with, I don't
know, the whole store.


123
0:4:12,29 --> 0:4:14,62
They can't wrap their head
around why anybody would buy


124
0:4:14,62 --> 0:4:16,529
any of this.


125
0:4:16,529 --> 0:4:17,7
But for us, I mean,
this is my life.


126
0:4:17,7 --> 0:4:18,636
This has been my life.


127
0:4:18,636 --> 0:4:20,4
All of us.


128
0:4:20,4 --> 0:4:22,85



129
0:4:22,85 --> 0:4:26,4
It's like I travel on the
weekend quite a bit, when I'm


130
0:4:26,4 --> 0:4:28,0
not tattooing.


131
0:4:28,0 --> 0:4:31,32
Flea markets, yard sales,
Craigslist.


132
0:4:31,32 --> 0:4:34,8
I get it anywhere
I can, you know?


133
0:4:34,8 --> 0:4:37,2
It's a pretty small window
of opportunity


134
0:4:37,2 --> 0:4:38,46
for me to get stuff.


135
0:4:38,46 --> 0:4:41,236
So all week, I'm trying
to line stuff up.


136
0:4:41,236 --> 0:4:42,81
STEVE BOLTZ: He's a
bit of a picker.


137
0:4:42,81 --> 0:4:44,49
I mean, he likes to
go to antique


138
0:4:44,49 --> 0:4:46,35
stores and antique fairs.


139
0:4:46,35 --> 0:4:50,2



140
0:4:50,2 --> 0:4:53,7
And then, of course, Black Gold
now has given him purpose


141
0:4:53,7 --> 0:4:54,58
in that hoarding.


142
0:4:54,58 --> 0:4:57,49
I think, before, it was just
like having stuff.


143
0:4:57,49 --> 0:4:58,9
We all like to just
have stuff we like


144
0:4:58,9 --> 0:4:59,79
to look at or whatever.


145
0:4:59,79 --> 0:5:1,13
But now he's got the store.


146
0:5:1,13 --> 0:5:3,85
Now he can actually
justify having as


147
0:5:3,85 --> 0:5:4,86
much of it as he wants.


148
0:5:4,86 --> 0:5:9,88
BERT KRAK: A lot of stuff that
Dan looks for is kind of tied


149
0:5:9,88 --> 0:5:13,2
into tattooing, as far as what
the image is or it's got those


150
0:5:13,2 --> 0:5:14,76
rock of ages things.


151
0:5:14,76 --> 0:5:21,4
It's like classic tattoo motifs
that he looks for.


152
0:5:21,4 --> 0:5:24,96
I guess it's stuff that
tattooing has borrowed from


153
0:5:24,96 --> 0:5:26,582
the real world, you know?


154
0:5:26,582 --> 0:5:30,14
STEVE BOLTZ: Dan's object
hoarding, it comes mainly from


155
0:5:30,14 --> 0:5:32,0
tattooing, I would imagine,
even though there's other


156
0:5:32,0 --> 0:5:34,82
influences, because you just
are exposed to so many


157
0:5:34,82 --> 0:5:36,3
different types of art.


158
0:5:36,3 --> 0:5:39,215
You think about tattooing now,
well, that crawling panther


159
0:5:39,215 --> 0:5:40,59
has been drawn for us already.


160
0:5:40,59 --> 0:5:40,81
You know what I mean?


161
0:5:40,81 --> 0:5:43,78
But there was a time when
it didn't exist.


162
0:5:43,78 --> 0:5:45,44
And somebody came in and
wanted a panther


163
0:5:45,44 --> 0:5:46,52
crawling up their arm.


164
0:5:46,52 --> 0:5:50,0
Well, Coleman or one of these
guys had to find some sort of


165
0:5:50,0 --> 0:5:51,23
reference for this.


166
0:5:51,23 --> 0:5:53,88
And a lot of early designs,
they'll come from old


167
0:5:53,88 --> 0:5:58,32
children's books or comics
or whatever.


168
0:5:58,32 --> 0:6:0,42
Or the Kewpie is
a good example.


169
0:6:0,42 --> 0:6:2,4
A Kewpie was an actual doll.


170
0:6:2,4 --> 0:6:4,85
Then it became a tattoo
icon over the years.


171
0:6:4,85 --> 0:6:8,61
But now, because we know that
Kewpie so well, well, you go


172
0:6:8,61 --> 0:6:11,4
into an antique store or
something and you see a little


173
0:6:11,4 --> 0:6:13,22
Kewpie doll sitting on the
shelf, you're like, oh, there


174
0:6:13,22 --> 0:6:14,14
it is in 3D.


175
0:6:14,14 --> 0:6:14,89
DAN SANTORO: Oh yeah.


176
0:6:14,89 --> 0:6:15,47
Here's another thing.


177
0:6:15,47 --> 0:6:17,56
That thing is ready to
be a tattoo too.


178
0:6:17,56 --> 0:6:20,32
There's a Kewpie little
home butler thing.


179
0:6:20,32 --> 0:6:22,56
But it's a Kewpie.


180
0:6:22,56 --> 0:6:24,32
Who doesn't want that?


181
0:6:24,32 --> 0:6:25,76
My house has, more or
less, looked like


182
0:6:25,76 --> 0:6:28,0
this for a long time.


183
0:6:28,0 --> 0:6:33,78
It went from "Star Wars" toys,
as much as I can fill.


184
0:6:33,78 --> 0:6:35,13
I thought it was corny
for a while.


185
0:6:35,13 --> 0:6:37,51
So then I did the thrasher
cut out thing.


186
0:6:37,51 --> 0:6:41,81
As long as the walls just
looked like culture


187
0:6:41,81 --> 0:6:43,61
vomit, I was happy.


188
0:6:43,61 --> 0:6:44,34
You know what I mean?


189
0:6:44,34 --> 0:6:45,97
And then it became like
tattoo flash.


190
0:6:45,97 --> 0:6:51,71
And then tattoo flash kind of
evolved into old circus prints


191
0:6:51,71 --> 0:6:55,58
and lithographs that were what
a lot of the tattoo stuff was


192
0:6:55,58 --> 0:6:57,35
derived from, and so on,
and so on, and so on.


193
0:6:57,35 --> 0:6:59,48
And then, the next thing
you know, you've


194
0:6:59,48 --> 0:7:0,48
got a lot of stuff.


195
0:7:0,48 --> 0:7:7,43
[ORGAN MUSIC]


196
0:7:7,43 --> 0:7:9,6
ELI QUINTERS: It's not
a big apartment.


197
0:7:9,6 --> 0:7:11,89
And he's filled the walls.


198
0:7:11,89 --> 0:7:14,26
But it's all amazing
stuff, you know?


199
0:7:14,26 --> 0:7:20,62
It's top of the line taxidermy,
old tattoo flash.


200
0:7:20,62 --> 0:7:22,7
It's just the way he wants it.


201
0:7:22,7 --> 0:7:23,49
You know what I mean?


202
0:7:23,49 --> 0:7:26,22
It's a good representation
of the stuff that


203
0:7:26,22 --> 0:7:27,33
he's passionate about.

[ORGAN MUSIC]


205
0:7:29,262 --> 0:7:31,44
DAN SANTORO: Oh!


206
0:7:31,44 --> 0:7:32,94
I just found this at
a flea market.


207
0:7:32,94 --> 0:7:37,74
It's a studio portrait of a
mother and two children.


208
0:7:37,74 --> 0:7:40,58
And the two kids are on
a taxidermied ostrich.


209
0:7:40,58 --> 0:7:41,62
It's like anything, you know?


210
0:7:41,62 --> 0:7:43,3
You get into collecting
one thing.


211
0:7:43,3 --> 0:7:45,73
And then you start to pick up
the subtleties that make one


212
0:7:45,73 --> 0:7:47,55
thing more appealing
than the other.


213
0:7:47,55 --> 0:7:49,86
I've been flea marketing
for a long time.


214
0:7:49,86 --> 0:7:52,27
And if I had seen something
like this, I'd probably be


215
0:7:52,27 --> 0:7:53,41
interested in buying it.


216
0:7:53,41 --> 0:7:54,98
But I wouldn't know why.


217
0:7:54,98 --> 0:8:0,2
Whereas now, I'm a little bit
more immersed in collecting.


218
0:8:0,2 --> 0:8:2,21
It's pretty easy to
pick up on what


219
0:8:2,21 --> 0:8:3,29
makes something desirable.


220
0:8:3,29 --> 0:8:4,79
So to me, that's
very desirable.


221
0:8:4,79 --> 0:8:5,44
It's an ostrich.


222
0:8:5,44 --> 0:8:7,74
How often do you see an ostrich
in a photo from the


223
0:8:7,74 --> 0:8:9,57
turn of the century?


224
0:8:9,57 --> 0:8:11,64
This is a photo I picked up
that I thought was pretty


225
0:8:11,64 --> 0:8:13,59
interesting, just in a
box of random photos.


226
0:8:13,59 --> 0:8:17,16
It's obviously some kind
of carnival performer.


227
0:8:17,16 --> 0:8:18,6
But she's reading a magazine.


228
0:8:18,6 --> 0:8:22,5
And the back ad of the magazine
is, "Tattoo your


229
0:8:22,5 --> 0:8:25,95
lips." Another stony tattooing
the inside of a woman lips.


230
0:8:25,95 --> 0:8:29,72
ELI QUINTERS: Very well-studied
in stuff of that


231
0:8:29,72 --> 0:8:34,6
era, of when American tattooing
came to life.


232
0:8:34,6 --> 0:8:39,179
He knows a lot about that
era in history anyway.


233
0:8:39,179 --> 0:8:43,329
And so I think he collects
a lot of that stuff.


234
0:8:43,329 --> 0:8:46,71
So he's very well-studied
in antique flash.


235
0:8:46,71 --> 0:8:48,985
And he knows a lot
about that stuff.

[MUSIC PLAYING]


237
0:8:53,735 --> 0:8:55,73
DAN SANTORO: I have a lithograph
of that at the


238
0:8:55,73 --> 0:8:57,3
store right now.


239
0:8:57,3 --> 0:9:0,32
That's the one that I said you
see a lot of the lithographs


240
0:9:0,32 --> 0:9:3,2
that old tattooers
pulled from.


241
0:9:3,2 --> 0:9:5,57
That particular image, I had
never seen recreated as a


242
0:9:5,57 --> 0:9:6,67
tattoo before.


243
0:9:6,67 --> 0:9:8,55
And I had actually obtained
this about


244
0:9:8,55 --> 0:9:9,91
five, six years ago.


245
0:9:9,91 --> 0:9:11,53
And I was like, oh, that's
the coolest thing.


246
0:9:11,53 --> 0:9:12,57
I didn't know who did it.


247
0:9:12,57 --> 0:9:14,37
It came from the same collection
that a bunch of


248
0:9:14,37 --> 0:9:18,42
other stuff that I was told
was Coleman came from.


249
0:9:18,42 --> 0:9:22,9
He was a tattooer
from Virginia.


250
0:9:22,9 --> 0:9:24,61
He just was the pioneer
of a lot of the


251
0:9:24,61 --> 0:9:26,67
style that we see today.


252
0:9:26,67 --> 0:9:29,49
He had a knack for drawing
really pretty women.


253
0:9:29,49 --> 0:9:34,4
And everything he did was a
step above everything else


254
0:9:34,4 --> 0:9:35,43
that was going on at the time.


255
0:9:35,43 --> 0:9:39,26
This is a famous photo of
Coleman outside his shop.


256
0:9:39,26 --> 0:9:41,37
So I've seen this photo
hundreds of times.


257
0:9:41,37 --> 0:9:43,89
I was like, oh, if I could only
see around the corner of


258
0:9:43,89 --> 0:9:44,6
that, you know?


259
0:9:44,6 --> 0:9:47,61
And then, when this book came
out, boom, the other wall.


260
0:9:47,61 --> 0:9:51,45
And that made my day.


261
0:9:51,45 --> 0:9:56,9
100%, that is that.


262
0:9:56,9 --> 0:9:58,68
I was told his shop
burned down.


263
0:9:58,68 --> 0:10:0,51
Then a lot of the stuff got
kicked to the curb.


264
0:10:0,51 --> 0:10:4,25
And the woman that I acquired a
lot of this stuff from, her


265
0:10:4,25 --> 0:10:8,78
husband had gone and, I guess,
picked up a lot of this stuff,


266
0:10:8,78 --> 0:10:10,43
literally, off the
side of the road.


267
0:10:10,43 --> 0:10:13,73
And so that's why something
like that exists.


268
0:10:13,73 --> 0:10:15,82
That was just two of the designs
on the sheet that


269
0:10:15,82 --> 0:10:17,44
weren't scorched.


270
0:10:17,44 --> 0:10:19,81
There's a photo of
him tattooing.


271
0:10:19,81 --> 0:10:23,1
It's that famous photo of him
tattooing with the visor.


272
0:10:23,1 --> 0:10:24,24
There's all the flash
on the wall.


273
0:10:24,24 --> 0:10:25,89
He's got one sheet
off the wall.


274
0:10:25,89 --> 0:10:27,73
And it's propped up
on his station.


275
0:10:27,73 --> 0:10:29,81
And these two designs
are on that sheet.


276
0:10:29,81 --> 0:10:30,74
But it had been cut.


277
0:10:30,74 --> 0:10:33,38
A lot of this stuff got cut.


278
0:10:33,38 --> 0:10:35,51
One thing that I really don't
ever want to be is


279
0:10:35,51 --> 0:10:36,72
self-absorbed.


280
0:10:36,72 --> 0:10:39,68
And when someone asks me to talk
about all these things


281
0:10:39,68 --> 0:10:41,38
that I've surrounded myself
with, it makes me feel like


282
0:10:41,38 --> 0:10:42,63
I'm self-absorbed.


283
0:10:42,63 --> 0:12:42,63
