1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:6,37



2
0:0:6,37 --> 0:0:8,32
PATRICK O'DELL: What videos do
you have that you're in?


3
0:0:8,32 --> 0:0:10,18
I can see one of them?


4
0:0:10,18 --> 0:0:13,161
JERRY HSU: I can't believe
you're making me watch this.


5
0:0:13,161 --> 0:0:17,99
Wait, this is a trick that I
worked on for weeks, like


6
0:0:17,99 --> 0:0:19,86
weeks nonstop trying
to learn it.


7
0:0:19,86 --> 0:0:22,32
PATRICK O'DELL: Dude, you
have the hugest pants.


8
0:0:22,32 --> 0:0:25,7
JERRY HSU: I know, it's funny
because I wanted them bigger.


9
0:0:25,7 --> 0:0:29,23
Because that was what skaters
did, and I just wanted to look


10
0:0:29,23 --> 0:0:31,23
like skaters.


11
0:0:31,23 --> 0:0:34,39
Like skaters looked so retarded
when I started


12
0:0:34,39 --> 0:0:37,31
skating, and I wanted
to look like that.


13
0:0:37,31 --> 0:0:41,126



14
0:0:41,126 --> 0:0:43,236
PATRICK O'DELL: What is this
so torturous for you?


15
0:0:43,236 --> 0:0:45,82
JERRY HSU: I don't know.


16
0:0:45,82 --> 0:0:49,142
PATRICK O'DELL: I mean, is it
from watching yourself state?


17
0:0:49,142 --> 0:0:51,26
JERRY HSU: I don't think
I'd like it.


18
0:0:51,26 --> 0:0:52,5
PATRICK O'DELL: Hi, welcome
back to the


19
0:0:52,5 --> 0:0:53,78
"Epicly Later'd" show.


20
0:0:53,78 --> 0:0:56,12
This episode is about
Jerry Hsu.


21
0:0:56,12 --> 0:0:59,525
I went on a little trip to San
Jose, met up with Jerry.


22
0:0:59,525 --> 0:1:2,38
He just took me around in his
car, we went to some of the


23
0:1:2,38 --> 0:1:4,709
spots where he learned
how to skate.


24
0:1:4,709 --> 0:1:7,16
Jerry, since the first time he
started skating it seems, was


25
0:1:7,16 --> 0:1:10,16
a total child prodigy.


26
0:1:10,16 --> 0:1:13,845
At 13, it seems like he was as
good as most pro skaters.


27
0:1:13,845 --> 0:1:18,2
He also entrusted me with a VHS
tape of all his home skate


28
0:1:18,2 --> 0:1:20,42
videos from when he was 13.


29
0:1:20,42 --> 0:1:23,42
Anyway, this is the Jerry
Hsu episode and I


30
0:1:23,42 --> 0:1:24,253
hope you enjoy it.


31
0:1:24,253 --> 0:1:28,68
JERRY HSU: So basically now
we've entered the hotbed, the


32
0:1:28,68 --> 0:1:32,14
one mile radius of the
house I grew up in.


33
0:1:32,14 --> 0:1:37,28
So this is basically where
I did all of my skating.


34
0:1:37,28 --> 0:1:39,4
It's right there.


35
0:1:39,4 --> 0:1:41,76
Oh, dude, they knobbed it.


36
0:1:41,76 --> 0:1:44,418



37
0:1:44,418 --> 0:1:46,8
PATRICK O'DELL: Your
first handrail?


38
0:1:46,8 --> 0:1:47,33
JERRY HSU: Yeah.


39
0:1:47,33 --> 0:1:49,81



40
0:1:49,81 --> 0:1:54,91
Probably slid like here to
here, did a no slide.


41
0:1:54,91 --> 0:1:56,58
PATRICK O'DELL: That was your
first handrail trick?


42
0:1:56,58 --> 0:1:59,7
JERRY HSU: Yeah.


43
0:1:59,7 --> 0:2:0,862
PATRICK O'DELL: Because of you
they put a knob on it.


44
0:2:0,862 --> 0:2:2,843
JERRY HSU: Yeah, I hadn't
really been


45
0:2:2,843 --> 0:2:4,6
skating that long--


46
0:2:4,6 --> 0:2:5,2
just like three or four years.


47
0:2:5,2 --> 0:2:7,1
MARC JOHNSON: Did he show you
the footage of him skating in


48
0:2:7,1 --> 0:2:8,6
his garage?


49
0:2:8,6 --> 0:2:9,564
JERRY HSU: Filmed it himself?


50
0:2:9,564 --> 0:2:12,1
MARC JOHNSON: Yeah, like
just doing [INAUDIBLE]


51
0:2:12,1 --> 0:2:12,92
around his garage.


52
0:2:12,92 --> 0:2:16,22
Like him just going back and
forth, doing really hard


53
0:2:16,22 --> 0:2:18,33
tricks for back then
and stuff.


54
0:2:18,33 --> 0:2:19,475
PATRICK O'DELL: Did you just
set the camera up?


55
0:2:19,475 --> 0:2:21,61
JERRY HSU: Yeah, I'm just
setting the camera up and


56
0:2:21,61 --> 0:2:24,9
filming myself because I wanted
to know what everything


57
0:2:24,9 --> 0:2:25,33
looked like.


58
0:2:25,33 --> 0:2:28,2
I just wanted to know what
skating looked like.


59
0:2:28,2 --> 0:2:33,94
I wanted everything in my life
to revolve around skating.


60
0:2:33,94 --> 0:2:35,92
So this is where my
parents live.


61
0:2:35,92 --> 0:2:39,301



62
0:2:39,301 --> 0:2:43,648
And this is where I
started skating--


63
0:2:43,648 --> 0:2:46,38
and there's my parking block.


64
0:2:46,38 --> 0:2:49,39
My mom figured out that skaters
liked the skate


65
0:2:49,39 --> 0:2:50,13
parking blocks.


66
0:2:50,13 --> 0:2:54,1
One day after work she went
to a construction site or


67
0:2:54,1 --> 0:2:56,76
something and bought
one and brought it


68
0:2:56,76 --> 0:2:59,18
home for me to skate.


69
0:2:59,18 --> 0:3:1,6
Hello?


70
0:3:1,6 --> 0:3:1,54
Hey, dad.


71
0:3:1,54 --> 0:3:2,395
CHING HSU: Hi.


72
0:3:2,395 --> 0:3:5,64
JERRY HSU: Dad, he's filming me
for a little internet show.


73
0:3:5,64 --> 0:3:6,785
CHING HSU: OK, cool.


74
0:3:6,785 --> 0:3:9,16
JERRY HSU: Yeah, is
mom around, too?


75
0:3:9,16 --> 0:3:9,996
CHING HSU: Yeah.


76
0:3:9,996 --> 0:3:11,42
JERRY HSU: Hi, mom.


77
0:3:11,42 --> 0:3:13,296
SU HSU: Oh, he's going
to interview me?


78
0:3:13,296 --> 0:3:14,385
JERRY HSU: Yeah, is that OK?


79
0:3:14,385 --> 0:3:16,17
SU HSU: Oh, OK.


80
0:3:16,17 --> 0:3:17,876
PATRICK O'DELL: When he was
young did you ever worry he


81
0:3:17,876 --> 0:3:19,11
was going to get hurt or
anything like that?


82
0:3:19,11 --> 0:3:21,646
SU HSU: Sure.


83
0:3:21,646 --> 0:3:23,204
Which mother doesn't?


84
0:3:23,204 --> 0:3:26,541
PATRICK O'DELL: Did you want
him to go to college?


85
0:3:26,541 --> 0:3:27,97
SU HSU: Sure.


86
0:3:27,97 --> 0:3:31,3
That's probably every parent's
first choice.


87
0:3:31,3 --> 0:3:33,83
Well, I'm happy for
him as I said.


88
0:3:33,83 --> 0:3:38,753
This is his job, not mine, and
it's his life, not mine.


89
0:3:38,753 --> 0:3:41,74
MARC JOHNSON: It's traditional
Chinese, like comes from a


90
0:3:41,74 --> 0:3:43,6
traditional Chinese family.


91
0:3:43,6 --> 0:3:47,5
And it's just the cultures are
different and he just chose a


92
0:3:47,5 --> 0:3:50,44
different road and I don't think
he'd have been happy


93
0:3:50,44 --> 0:3:53,61
being a computer programmer
or something like that.


94
0:3:53,61 --> 0:3:56,93
I think he knew what he
wanted to do, despite


95
0:3:56,93 --> 0:3:58,15
what anybody said.


96
0:3:58,15 --> 0:4:0,76
He just kept doing it.


97
0:4:0,76 --> 0:4:4,712



98
0:4:4,712 --> 0:4:6,315
JERRY HSU: Are you waiting
for me to speak Chinese?


99
0:4:6,315 --> 0:4:7,565
PATRICK O'DELL: Yeah.


100
0:4:7,565 --> 0:4:12,12



101
0:4:12,12 --> 0:4:17,5
[SPEAKING CHINESE]


102
0:4:17,5 --> 0:4:19,149
JERRY HSU: I got caught
shoplifting here


103
0:4:19,149 --> 0:4:22,22
when I was like 13.


104
0:4:22,22 --> 0:4:25,78
And they called the cops and
the cops took me home.


105
0:4:25,78 --> 0:4:28,69
And my grandpa was there and
he didn't speak English.


106
0:4:28,69 --> 0:4:34,11
And the cops dropped me
off, and my grandpa


107
0:4:34,11 --> 0:4:35,14
was freaking out.


108
0:4:35,14 --> 0:4:37,895
And he thought I got arrested,
which I kind of did.


109
0:4:37,895 --> 0:4:41,1
But I totally lied to him in
Chinese and told him that I


110
0:4:41,1 --> 0:4:45,346
got lost and the cops just
brought me home.


111
0:4:45,346 --> 0:4:48,462
PATRICK O'DELL: What
did you steal?


112
0:4:48,462 --> 0:4:50,91
JERRY HSU: This is pretty funny,
but I tried to steal my


113
0:4:50,91 --> 0:4:52,5
own photos.


114
0:4:52,5 --> 0:4:54,6
PATRICK O'DELL: What were
they photos of?


115
0:4:54,6 --> 0:4:56,6
JERRY HSU: Probably just me
and my friend skating.


116
0:4:56,6 --> 0:4:59,472



117
0:4:59,472 --> 0:5:2,3
This is like my first
line spot.


118
0:5:2,3 --> 0:5:4,65
We would come here after school
and hang out with this


119
0:5:4,65 --> 0:5:7,13
guy who worked here.


120
0:5:7,13 --> 0:5:13,14
And he was like an older guy who
claimed to be a pro skater


121
0:5:13,14 --> 0:5:16,11
in the '80s, but we totally
believed him because we were


122
0:5:16,11 --> 0:5:17,78
just like 12.


123
0:5:17,78 --> 0:5:21,1
So it was so impressive to us
that we believed anything he


124
0:5:21,1 --> 0:5:24,645
said, but really he was kind
of just like a liar.


125
0:5:24,645 --> 0:5:25,68
MATT EVERSOLE: [INAUDIBLE]


126
0:5:25,68 --> 0:5:28,57
me and his brother went to
play basketball down the


127
0:5:28,57 --> 0:5:30,176
street from his house.


128
0:5:30,176 --> 0:5:33,33
And there was these two kids
skating and they came over and


129
0:5:33,33 --> 0:5:36,4
said hello, and it was Jerry
and his friend Will.


130
0:5:36,4 --> 0:5:38,18
He was just like some
dorky little kid.


131
0:5:38,18 --> 0:5:41,5
He was wearing these Dickies and
they were blown out ass.


132
0:5:41,5 --> 0:5:43,38
And he was just going for it--


133
0:5:43,38 --> 0:5:46,37
hucking his body off of the
deck, 360 flip, and just


134
0:5:46,37 --> 0:5:47,18
eating shit.


135
0:5:47,18 --> 0:5:49,49
And we were all like oh my
God, this kid wants it.


136
0:5:49,49 --> 0:5:51,902
But it was pretty incredible.


137
0:5:51,902 --> 0:5:54,19
JERRY HSU: These are like some
stairs I ollied once.


138
0:5:54,19 --> 0:5:56,29
These are actually stairs
that we skated like


139
0:5:56,29 --> 0:5:57,49
every single day.


140
0:5:57,49 --> 0:6:0,97
And we'd try to do every single
trick that we possibly


141
0:6:0,97 --> 0:6:1,95
knew how to do down them.


142
0:6:1,95 --> 0:6:3,5
And we would just like
throw ourselves down


143
0:6:3,5 --> 0:6:4,53
these little stairs.


144
0:6:4,53 --> 0:6:8,52
One of the myths that we heard
when we were little kids is a


145
0:6:8,52 --> 0:6:15,65
skater ollied from the stairs
to the street, which is


146
0:6:15,65 --> 0:6:16,713
basically impossible--


147
0:6:16,713 --> 0:6:20,166
I don't like anyone
could do it.


148
0:6:20,166 --> 0:6:25,36
But we would try and ollie, like
long jump, we would try


149
0:6:25,36 --> 0:6:28,63
and ollie as far as we could to
try and eventually get to


150
0:6:28,63 --> 0:6:31,29
the street.


151
0:6:31,29 --> 0:6:33,42
I made it to here.


152
0:6:33,42 --> 0:6:35,55
MATT EVERSOLE: Darkslides, he
did darkslides back then.


153
0:6:35,55 --> 0:6:36,71
PATRICK O'DELL: Yeah,
I couldn't believe


154
0:6:36,71 --> 0:6:37,59
that, I was like what?


155
0:6:37,59 --> 0:6:39,71
MATT EVERSOLE: A kid in middle
school doing darkslides.


156
0:6:39,71 --> 0:6:40,63
PATRICK O'DELL: And
landing them.


157
0:6:40,63 --> 0:6:42,4
I could see him getting
into them.


158
0:6:42,4 --> 0:6:44,99
MATT EVERSOLE: Oh yeah,
I just watched him


159
0:6:44,99 --> 0:6:47,13
just grow into himself.


160
0:6:47,13 --> 0:6:50,32
Like he found a uniqueness like


161
0:6:50,32 --> 0:6:52,51
unmistakable Jerry, you know?


162
0:6:52,51 --> 0:6:54,506
FEMALE SPEAKER: Quiet
down everyone.


163
0:6:54,506 --> 0:6:57,225
We have a new student today in
class, his name is Jerry Hsu.


164
0:6:57,225 --> 0:6:58,896
OK, Jerry, why don't you
tell the class a


165
0:6:58,896 --> 0:7:0,12
little bit about yourself?


166
0:7:0,12 --> 0:7:4,23
JERRY HSU: My name's Jerry Hsu,
and I'm 14-years-old and


167
0:7:4,23 --> 0:7:7,11
I live in San Jose.


168
0:7:7,11 --> 0:7:9,1
Sorry, it's just like I'm
watching this and


169
0:7:9,1 --> 0:7:10,77
it's kind of crazy.


170
0:7:10,77 --> 0:7:14,99
It's like every video part that
I make, I want it to be


171
0:7:14,99 --> 0:7:17,22
the best I could possibly do.


172
0:7:17,22 --> 0:7:19,56
Of course it never really ends
up being like that, but


173
0:7:19,56 --> 0:7:24,98
definitely every time I start a
new project, I just want it


174
0:7:24,98 --> 0:7:25,87
to be really good.


175
0:7:25,87 --> 0:7:28,52
I think it's just wanting to be
good at something, and to


176
0:7:28,52 --> 0:7:29,21
get better at it.


177
0:7:29,21 --> 0:7:30,54
And then when you don't
want to do that, then


178
0:7:30,54 --> 0:7:32,46
you stop doing it.


179
0:7:32,46 --> 0:7:33,35
Oh, this kid?


180
0:7:33,35 --> 0:7:36,57
He tried to pickpocket me in
Moscow and I caught him.


181
0:7:36,57 --> 0:7:40,43
And then he swung around
and did a karate kick,


182
0:7:40,43 --> 0:7:42,55
but he missed me.


183
0:7:42,55 --> 0:7:45,16
He was like a gypsy kid.


184
0:7:45,16 --> 0:7:47,47
His whole family were gypsies
and they're all trying to rob


185
0:7:47,47 --> 0:7:48,94
us by creating diversions.


186
0:7:48,94 --> 0:7:51,34
Like his sisters were all doing
cartwheels in front of


187
0:7:51,34 --> 0:7:53,59
us, and then all the brothers
were behind us trying to


188
0:7:53,59 --> 0:7:54,57
pickpocket us.


189
0:7:54,57 --> 0:7:58,97
And their dad was walking
alongside of us, supervising


190
0:7:58,97 --> 0:8:0,22
the robbery.


191
0:8:0,22 --> 0:8:3,35



192
0:8:3,35 --> 0:8:6,78
This is a photo of
my friend Louie.


193
0:8:6,78 --> 0:8:11,92
We're just riding mopeds
in Cambodia.


194
0:8:11,92 --> 0:8:14,42
That's the only country I've
ever been to that doesn't have


195
0:8:14,42 --> 0:8:15,816
a McDonald's in it.


196
0:8:15,816 --> 0:8:19,62
But it's crazy, it's one of
those countries with like


197
0:8:19,62 --> 0:8:24,13
naked babies walking around, and
people with no arms, and


198
0:8:24,13 --> 0:8:27,27
people with machine guns
just walking around--


199
0:8:27,27 --> 0:8:27,97
it's pretty fucked up.


200
0:8:27,97 --> 0:8:29,51
But yeah, we went
to a gun range.


201
0:8:29,51 --> 0:8:33,69
And for $20 you could shoot
AKs and throw grenades.


202
0:8:33,69 --> 0:8:40,26
And for a little more money, you
can bring a cow there and


203
0:8:40,26 --> 0:8:44,22
throw a grenade at it and
just watch it blow up.


204
0:8:44,22 --> 0:8:49,91
This was in Moscow, and this
guy was just wasted and


205
0:8:49,91 --> 0:8:50,84
couldn't stand up.


206
0:8:50,84 --> 0:8:55,96
And then we were all watching
him and then he just tipped


207
0:8:55,96 --> 0:8:57,953
over like a tree falling over.


208
0:8:57,953 --> 0:9:0,82
And he fell, like his head right
on the curb, there's


209
0:9:0,82 --> 0:9:1,76
blood was everywhere.


210
0:9:1,76 --> 0:9:5,52
And everyone walking around was
just ignoring him, like it


211
0:9:5,52 --> 0:9:6,86
wasn't even happening.


212
0:9:6,86 --> 0:9:10,47
This is kind of like a gem.


213
0:9:10,47 --> 0:9:15,26
This is me, I used to play
Rambo when I was a kid.


214
0:9:15,26 --> 0:9:21,37
I seriously have no filing
system, it's so disorganized


215
0:9:21,37 --> 0:9:25,1
and kind of embarrassing.


216
0:9:25,1 --> 0:9:27,19
This is my drawer of
sketchy photos.


217
0:9:27,19 --> 0:9:28,865
PATRICK O'DELL: That's hidden?


218
0:9:28,865 --> 0:9:30,38
JERRY HSU: But you probably
can't film it.


219
0:9:30,38 --> 0:9:33,272



220
0:9:33,272 --> 0:9:35,0
PATRICK O'DELL: I see
that you spend a


221
0:9:35,0 --> 0:9:37,25
lot of money on framing.


222
0:9:37,25 --> 0:9:40,854
JERRY HSU: Yeah, I take really
good care of them, too.


223
0:9:40,854 --> 0:9:42,31
I like to collect masks.


224
0:9:42,31 --> 0:9:49,23
I got it in Japan, and the name
of it was Hollywood Girl.


225
0:9:49,23 --> 0:9:51,28
MATT EVERSOLE: The way that
Jerry lives his life is like


226
0:9:51,28 --> 0:9:52,52
he lives it on his own terms.


227
0:9:52,52 --> 0:9:54,775
He wears what he wants
to wear, he sleeps


228
0:9:54,775 --> 0:9:55,82
when he wants to sleep.


229
0:9:55,82 --> 0:9:58,28
He does whatever
he wants to do.


230
0:9:58,28 --> 0:10:2,17
And when you're in a business
situation, they either don't


231
0:10:2,17 --> 0:10:5,43
like that because they can't
do that, or they don't like


232
0:10:5,43 --> 0:10:7,96
that because it's not marketable
or whatever.


233
0:10:7,96 --> 0:10:10,42
He's kind of like an old soul,
like he's way ahead


234
0:10:10,42 --> 0:10:12,52
of people up here.


235
0:10:12,52 --> 0:10:14,8
He's the guy that's younger
than you and


236
0:10:14,8 --> 0:10:16,44
you look up to him.


237
0:10:16,44 --> 0:10:19,49
JERRY HSU: This is kind
of like the rec room.


238
0:10:19,49 --> 0:10:22,6



239
0:10:22,6 --> 0:10:24,48
PATRICK O'DELL: Dirt floors?


240
0:10:24,48 --> 0:10:25,72
JERRY HSU: Yeah, this
is probably the


241
0:10:25,72 --> 0:10:27,67
coolest room in my house.


242
0:10:27,67 --> 0:10:29,115
PATRICK O'DELL: Are you
going to build a well?


243
0:10:29,115 --> 0:10:29,78
JERRY HSU: Yeah.


244
0:10:29,78 --> 0:10:32,62
I started, but it's underneath
that piece of plywood.


245
0:10:32,62 --> 0:10:34,8
And it's not done yet,
so I don't really


246
0:10:34,8 --> 0:10:36,73
want to ruin the surprise.


247
0:10:36,73 --> 0:10:39,135
PATRICK O'DELL: Are there
any chicks down there?


248
0:10:39,135 --> 0:10:43,12
JERRY HSU: Not yet, but
hopefully soon.


249
0:10:43,12 --> 0:10:45,86



250
0:10:45,86 --> 0:10:47,37
Whoa, look at this one.


251
0:10:47,37 --> 0:10:48,69
PATRICK O'DELL: Oh shit, that's


252
0:10:48,69 --> 0:10:50,875
worth money right there.


253
0:10:50,875 --> 0:10:53,19
JERRY HSU: It's like one
of the best skate


254
0:10:53,19 --> 0:10:55,656
videos probably ever.


255
0:10:55,656 --> 0:10:58,24
PATRICK O'DELL: What do you
consider the job of being a


256
0:10:58,24 --> 0:10:58,88
pro skater?


257
0:10:58,88 --> 0:11:2,72
Like, what are the things that
you're supposed to do?


258
0:11:2,72 --> 0:11:5,96
JERRY HSU: Well, I guess the
main thing you have to do is


259
0:11:5,96 --> 0:11:7,47
be good at skateboarding.


260
0:11:7,47 --> 0:11:10,48
It's funny, because there's
nothing involved and there's a


261
0:11:10,48 --> 0:11:11,73
lot involved.


262
0:11:11,73 --> 0:11:13,35
You can be really, really
good, but no


263
0:11:13,35 --> 0:11:14,97
one will give a shit.


264
0:11:14,97 --> 0:11:16,96
There are amazing skaters
who are really


265
0:11:16,96 --> 0:11:19,62
unsuccessful as pro skaters.


266
0:11:19,62 --> 0:11:23,1
It's crazy, there's a lot of
discrimination in skating.


267
0:11:23,1 --> 0:11:26,45
But also it kind of makes sense,
because they want the


268
0:11:26,45 --> 0:11:29,98
people that endorse their shit
to be interesting and they


269
0:11:29,98 --> 0:11:32,84
want people to like
them and stuff.


270
0:11:32,84 --> 0:11:35,805
I don't know, ask me
another question.


271
0:11:35,805 --> 0:11:38,852
PATRICK O'DELL: Oh, this photo
is pretty controversial.


272
0:11:38,852 --> 0:11:39,56
JERRY HSU: Yeah?


273
0:11:39,56 --> 0:11:41,25
PATRICK O'DELL: What was
the deal with that?


274
0:11:41,25 --> 0:11:43,44
JERRY HSU: That's my
friend Tim's cat.


275
0:11:43,44 --> 0:11:45,24
I just, I don't know.


276
0:11:45,24 --> 0:11:49,16
Nothing's happening there, I'm
like really close to the cat,


277
0:11:49,16 --> 0:11:50,36
but I'm not touching it.


278
0:11:50,36 --> 0:11:55,49
That photo ended up on
a porno website, too.


279
0:11:55,49 --> 0:12:0,66
It was like a porno website,
one of those sites like has


280
0:12:0,66 --> 0:12:4,6
just shocking photos of things
that your friends email you.


281
0:12:4,6 --> 0:12:5,5
Some guy just sent me
a link to that.


282
0:12:5,5 --> 0:12:9,89
And it was on some sketchy
website with chicks with dicks


283
0:12:9,89 --> 0:12:13,18
and guys' dicks tied in knots
and things like that.


284
0:12:13,18 --> 0:14:13,18
