CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: Hi, I`m Carl Azuz.
You know, we think Fridays are awesome, but


2
0:0:17,39 --> 0:0:25,119
for the 4229 people aboard the Carnival "Triumph"
cruise ship, this Friday probably seems especially


3
0:0:25,119 --> 0:0:30,34
awesome. Because hopefully by now they are
all off that ship. On Sunday, the ship lost


4
0:0:30,34 --> 0:0:34,97
power in the Gulf of Mexico after a fire in
the engine room. Tugboats eventually came


5
0:0:34,97 --> 0:0:39,44
out to help pull the "Triumph" in the port
in Mobile, Alabama, but that has been very,


6
0:0:39,44 --> 0:0:45,46
very slow. And when the passengers finally
get off the ship, their nightmare may not


7
0:0:45,46 --> 0:0:51,41
be over. One doctor said, conditions on board
after the fire made the ship a floating petri


8
0:0:51,41 --> 0:0:56,77
dish, if that sounds kind of gross, that`s
his point. No power means the toilets stop


9
0:0:56,77 --> 0:1:1,75
working. Raw sewage can be a major health
risk, and we`ve heard reports about it slushing


10
0:1:1,75 --> 0:1:7,869
across the floors and running down the walls.
No power means food starts rotting, spoiled


11
0:1:7,869 --> 0:1:13,93
food can lead to E. coli or Salmonella. There
haven`t been any reports of any kind of outbreak


12
0:1:13,93 --> 0:1:18,84
on the ship. But the doctor says, a full-
blown infection might not show up for a couple


13
0:1:18,84 --> 0:1:23,86
of weeks. So, would you consider cruising
again after going through something like this?


14
0:1:23,86 --> 0:1:29,58
On our Facebook page, Mason said, "Sure. That
was just one very unlucky cruise." Joseph


15
0:1:29,58 --> 0:1:33,649
and Unique (ph) both said "No way." Reese
(ph) would consider taking another cruise,


16
0:1:33,649 --> 0:1:38,88
but not for a very long time, and Kora`s (ph)
opinion, if it happens again, it would definitely


17
0:1:38,88 --> 0:1:40,94
be something to tell your grandkids.


18
0:1:40,94 --> 0:1:46,39
Remember, a week or so ago, when we talked
about the asteroid that would fly by the Earth,


19
0:1:46,39 --> 0:1:51,369
today is the day. Scientists are sure it won`t
hit anything down here. But what about up


20
0:1:51,369 --> 0:1:51,619
there?


21
0:1:51,619 --> 0:1:52,369
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


22
0:1:52,369 --> 0:1:55,67
CHAD MYERS, AMS METEOROLOGIST: This is 17,000
miles away. Now, if you are watching a dish


23
0:1:55,67 --> 0:2:2,63
or Direct TV, your satellite is 22,000 miles
away. So, yes, there are some Earth satellites,


24
0:2:2,63 --> 0:2:7,7
here, around the ring. The Moon is far away.
The Moon is ten times farther away than what


25
0:2:7,7 --> 0:2:12,81
this thing is going to fly through our geosynchronous
Earth orbit. So, is there a chance of it hitting


26
0:2:12,81 --> 0:2:13,69
something? Yes.


27
0:2:13,69 --> 0:2:15,2
(END VIDEO CLIP)


28
0:2:15,2 --> 0:2:20,31
AZUZ: A chance? Sure. But it`s not too likely.
One analyst said, other objects pass through


29
0:2:20,31 --> 0:2:24,92
the same area every day. They don`t cause
any problems. This asteroid is a lot bigger


30
0:2:24,92 --> 0:2:29,239
than those, but that also means, it`s easier
to keep track of. So, scientists have a better


31
0:2:29,239 --> 0:2:32,56
idea of what it will or more likely will not
hit.

0:2:32,56 --> 0:2:34,129

33
0:2:34,129 --> 0:2:39,53
LEON PANETTA, U.S. DEFENSE SECRETARY: The
work that they do, contribution that they


34
0:2:39,53 --> 0:2:49,68
make does contribute to the success of combat
operations, particularly when they remove


35
0:2:49,68 --> 0:2:53,579
the enemy from the field of battle.


36
0:2:53,579 --> 0:2:57,189
(END VIDEO CLIP)


37
0:2:57,189 --> 0:3:1,739
AZUZ: Defense Secretary Panetta was talking
about members of the military who are not


38
0:3:1,739 --> 0:3:7,3
on the battlefield themselves. People who
operate drones, unmanned aircraft, or who


39
0:3:7,3 --> 0:3:11,719
are involved in the military cyber warfare
efforts. Secretary Panetta announced a new


40
0:3:11,719 --> 0:3:16,81
medal to honor those people -- the Distinguished
Warfare Medal -- he said it will be awarded


41
0:3:16,81 --> 0:3:22,989
for extraordinary actions that directly impact
combat operations, but don`t actually involve


42
0:3:22,989 --> 0:3:25,599
the physical risks of combat.


43
0:3:25,599 --> 0:3:29,73
You probably played with some remote control
cars or planes at some point -- Secretary


44
0:3:29,73 --> 0:3:35,49
Panetta says this kind of technology is changing
the way wars are fought. As drones get more


45
0:3:35,49 --> 0:3:37,34
attention, they can also cause some controversy.


46
0:3:37,34 --> 0:3:38,189
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


47
0:3:38,189 --> 0:3:41,45
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Drones are
remotely controlled aircraft. They are much


48
0:3:41,45 --> 0:3:46,159
more maneuverable than conventional aircraft,
much lighter, much cheaper to manufacturer,


49
0:3:46,159 --> 0:3:56,359
and the person, the pilot manning them can
be many thousands of miles away on the ground.


50
0:3:56,359 --> 0:4:0,819
Drones are used in two capacities: to support
troops on the ground to make sure that there


51
0:4:0,819 --> 0:4:6,499
are no enemy close to them, to make sure that
no IEDs, mines, bombs have been laid in the


52
0:4:6,499 --> 0:4:12,43
road ahead of them, and they are also used
in a surveillance capacity to monitor people


53
0:4:12,43 --> 0:4:16,7
who might be targets, and then at the end
of that surveillance, then the trigger can


54
0:4:16,7 --> 0:4:24,83
be pulled, and the missile can be fired from
that aircraft at that target.


55
0:4:24,83 --> 0:4:28,97
Drones are controversial because they can
kill from a great distance without certainty


56
0:4:28,97 --> 0:4:34,199
precisely who the person is on the ground
or the possibility of collateral damage that


57
0:4:34,199 --> 0:4:39,639
could be women, children in the vicinity.
That`s the concern. Also, the person on the


58
0:4:39,639 --> 0:4:45,6
ground, who is being killed, has no right
to defend himself. If the information is faulty,


59
0:4:45,6 --> 0:4:52,9
then this can be judged by some people to
be a wrongful death.


60
0:4:52,9 --> 0:4:57,53
Targets can take evasive measures, by staying
inside buildings. Drones that assigned to


61
0:4:57,53 --> 0:5:2,3
circle those buildings for days, even weeks
at a time, to monitor movements who comes,


62
0:5:2,3 --> 0:5:7,199
who goes. They can recognize whether it`s
a man or a woman entering that house. So targets


63
0:5:7,199 --> 0:5:12,47
have been known to not leave their location
for fear of giving themselves away. Osama


64
0:5:12,47 --> 0:5:18,81
bin Laden, in his compound in Abbotabad, Pakistan,
had tall trees planted, so that it was difficult


65
0:5:18,81 --> 0:5:24,4
for drones take a direct and positive recognition
of him.


66
0:5:24,4 --> 0:5:31,74
There is an incredible array of uses for drones
now. They can be used in agriculture to look


67
0:5:31,74 --> 0:5:37,3
at crops, they can be used by architects to
look at buildings. They can be used by law


68
0:5:37,3 --> 0:5:40,979
enforcement. They can be used by amateurs
as well, it`s just to take pretty pictures


69
0:5:40,979 --> 0:5:47,789
from high up. There is really, at the moment,
a hugely expanded role for drones in the civilian


70
0:5:47,789 --> 0:5:48,34
area.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Today`s "Shoutout" goes
out to Mrs. Weddington`s, Mrs. Wolzen`s and


74
0:5:56,53 --> 0:6:2,84
Ms. Anderson`s social studies classes at Schoo
Middle School in Lincoln, Nebraska. Which


75
0:6:2,84 --> 0:6:9,71
U.S. president`s face is not featured on Mt.
Rushmore? Is it George Washington, John Adams,


76
0:6:9,71 --> 0:6:19,409
Thomas Jefferson or Abraham Lincoln? You`ve
got three seconds, go!


77
0:6:19,409 --> 0:6:25,19
Mt. Rushmore features the faces of Washington,
Jefferson, Lincoln and Teddy Roosevelt. But


78
0:6:25,19 --> 0:6:30,5
not John Adams. That`s your answer and that`s
your "Shoutout".


79
0:6:30,5 --> 0:6:32,55
(END VIDEO CLIP)


80
0:6:32,55 --> 0:6:37,84
AZUZ: Maybe you owned government class, maybe
you can name all the U.S presidents. But do


81
0:6:37,84 --> 0:6:41,919
you know who is honored by President`s Day?
You could have asked Calvin Coolidge, but


82
0:6:41,919 --> 0:6:46,159
he might have been silent on the matter. Teddy
Roosevelt might have walked softly around


83
0:6:46,159 --> 0:6:50,759
the subject, despite being a rough writer.
Most Americans believe President`s Day is


84
0:6:50,759 --> 0:6:55,849
about every president we`ve had. But that`s
kind of wring, at least as far as its origin


85
0:6:55,849 --> 0:7:1,9
goes. President`s Day was originally Washington`s
birthday, just Washington`s. On February 22nd.


86
0:7:1,9 --> 0:7:7,629
It became a federal holiday in 1885, and as
far as the U.S government`s concerned, it`s


87
0:7:7,629 --> 0:7:13,3
still Washington`s birthday, not President`s
Day. In 1968, Congress voted to switch it


88
0:7:13,3 --> 0:7:18,289
to the third Monday in February, giving government
employees a three day weekend. But even though


89
0:7:18,289 --> 0:7:23,3
Washington`s birthday and Lincoln`s birthday
were only days apart, Congress refused to


90
0:7:23,3 --> 0:7:28,0
combine them n the President`s Day, though
that`s what many Americans do. So, if you


91
0:7:28,0 --> 0:7:31,629
work for the government, you`ll get a day
off for Washington`s birthday. If you don`t,


92
0:7:31,629 --> 0:7:36,419
you may get a day off for President`s Day.
Those, after all, are the precedents.


93
0:7:36,419 --> 0:7:41,33
Well, how do you stand out in the crowd? It`s
a question some of you might be wondering,


94
0:7:41,33 --> 0:7:45,479
as you start applying to college. Last weekend,
there was a major college fair, right next


95
0:7:45,479 --> 0:7:49,8
door to the CNN Center. I spoke with some
college admission officers there about what


96
0:7:49,8 --> 0:7:54,419
they look for in prospective students, and
about what they think, you should do, when


97
0:7:54,419 --> 0:7:55,36
you picking out a school.


98
0:7:55,36 --> 0:7:56,34
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


99
0:7:56,34 --> 0:8:0,21
QUENTIN JOHNSON, UNIVERSITY OF TAMPA: Someone
who really stands out, someone who`s really


100
0:8:0,21 --> 0:8:6,99
strong with their extracurricular activities
as well as someone that has done well academically.


101
0:8:6,99 --> 0:8:10,8
JESSICA GRANT, PRESBYTERIAN COLLEGE: Probably
maybe think of the top three things that they


102
0:8:10,8 --> 0:8:15,28
are looking for. I think, major does a big
part to consider. But also, what the school


103
0:8:15,28 --> 0:8:17,5
offers and the things that this school focuses
on.


104
0:8:17,5 --> 0:8:22,569
CLINTON HOBBS, YOUNG HARRIS COLLEGE: We tend
to find the students that are really emerged


105
0:8:22,569 --> 0:8:28,379
in the high school experience, involved in
three to four or five extracurricular or co-curricular


106
0:8:28,379 --> 0:8:35,7
activities, actively involved in civic opportunities,
maybe involved in their church. Tend to really


107
0:8:35,7 --> 0:8:42,909
impress us more. A more well rounded student,
a more holistically developed individual is


108
0:8:42,909 --> 0:8:47,72
going to be better prepared for today`s world,
career, work, life.

jeopardy, Leonard Cooper didn`t know the answer,
but he also knew it didn`t matter.

114
0:9:1,64 --> 0:9:3,63
Why? Did he come up with Ike, Dwight David
Eisenhower?


115
0:9:3,63 --> 0:9:4,53
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, I didn`t.


116
0:9:4,53 --> 0:9:5,76

120
0:9:13,6 --> 0:9:18,73
AZUZ: It sounds like the host appreciates
the smart Alecs, but I guess, you can afford


121
0:9:18,73 --> 0:9:22,58
to have some fun, when your victory isn`t
in jeopardy. All right. That`s going to wrap


122
0:9:22,58 --> 0:9:27,27
things up for today. Teachers, we are looking
for your feedback on today`s show. Asteroids,


123
0:9:27,27 --> 0:9:31,91
cruise, college -- finally, to share your
thought on our home page, there will be no


124
0:9:31,91 --> 0:9:35,66
show on Monday for President`s Day. We hope
you enjoy the long weekend, and we`ll forward


125
0:9:35,66 --> 0:11:35,66
to seeing you again on Tuesday. Bye there.
