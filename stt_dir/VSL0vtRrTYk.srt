0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:16,16



2
0:0:16,16 --> 0:0:17,23
My name is Annette Ramos.


3
0:0:17,23 --> 0:0:18,73
I'm the fashion editor
at Vice.


4
0:0:18,73 --> 0:0:21,595
And today you're at my house
because I am babysitting for


5
0:0:21,595 --> 0:0:25,8
my parents' sugar gliders.


6
0:0:25,8 --> 0:0:26,42
I know that they're
from Australia.


7
0:0:26,42 --> 0:0:28,57
They're marsupials.


8
0:0:28,57 --> 0:0:30,61
They are closely related
to koalas.


9
0:0:30,61 --> 0:0:32,79
They are called sugar gliders
because of their preference


10
0:0:32,79 --> 0:0:33,58
for nectarous foods.


11
0:0:33,58 --> 0:0:37,15
And they basically just
eat fruit and insects.


12
0:0:37,15 --> 0:0:39,42
I'm feeding them peach yogurt.


13
0:0:39,42 --> 0:0:41,15
They hate all other flavors,
though, which is weird.


14
0:0:41,15 --> 0:0:43,67
They are very easy to take care
of-- apples, Gatorade,


15
0:0:43,67 --> 0:0:46,37
and grain, and maybe
some yogurt.


16
0:0:46,37 --> 0:0:48,57
Their tails are so long because
they can actually use


17
0:0:48,57 --> 0:0:50,98
them to wrap around things.


18
0:0:50,98 --> 0:0:52,63
And they have these crazy
long tongues, too.


19
0:0:52,63 --> 0:0:53,67
They are, like, this long.


20
0:0:53,67 --> 0:0:55,5
They clean themselves.


21
0:0:55,5 --> 0:0:57,23
You'll see them huddled up in
a ball together just, like,


22
0:0:57,23 --> 0:0:58,465
licking each other.


23
0:0:58,465 --> 0:1:0,54
They have little flaps
underneath both of their arms.


24
0:1:0,54 --> 0:1:4,709
If you put them on a high
ledge, they fly off.


25
0:1:4,709 --> 0:1:8,54
No, no, no, you're not
going in my closet.


26
0:1:8,54 --> 0:1:12,33
When we first got them, it took
a while to get used to


27
0:1:12,33 --> 0:1:14,9
them because they would
just jump on you.


28
0:1:14,9 --> 0:1:17,42
And sometimes, if you're not
turned the right way, they'll


29
0:1:17,42 --> 0:1:21,634
jump into your hair and just,
like, dangle there.


30
0:1:21,634 --> 0:1:22,83
Come on, yeah.


31
0:1:22,83 --> 0:1:24,83
[LAUGH]


32
0:1:24,83 --> 0:1:27,44
During the day, I let them crawl
around because they are


33
0:1:27,44 --> 0:1:29,96
normally really tame
and sleepy.


34
0:1:29,96 --> 0:1:34,14
So they're not trying
to experiment.


35
0:1:34,14 --> 0:1:35,866
Where is she?


36
0:1:35,866 --> 0:1:38,47
They actually sleep
most of the day.


37
0:1:38,47 --> 0:1:42,57
They're nocturnal, so they wake
up at 10:00 PM, normally,


38
0:1:42,57 --> 0:1:45,33
and they go to bed
around 10:00 PM.


39
0:1:45,33 --> 0:1:47,35
But every now and then they wake
up during the day just to


40
0:1:47,35 --> 0:1:48,79
play, and then they
go back to sleep.


41
0:1:48,79 --> 0:1:50,13
But when they're awake,
they're awake


42
0:1:50,13 --> 0:1:51,8
for, like, 12 hours.


43
0:1:51,8 --> 0:1:55,2
They love this wheel, which
is extremely loud.


44
0:1:55,2 --> 0:1:57,46
Because they're awake all night,
it's a little difficult


45
0:1:57,46 --> 0:2:0,11
taking care of them in
a studio apartment.


46
0:2:0,11 --> 0:2:2,38
And then occasionally at night,
they will bark if they


47
0:2:2,38 --> 0:2:4,69
want your attention, like when
they first wake up, they want


48
0:2:4,69 --> 0:2:5,94
to see you.


49
0:2:5,94 --> 0:2:24,67



50
0:2:24,67 --> 0:2:26,81
My dogs, they're fascinated
by them.


51
0:2:26,81 --> 0:2:28,42
I have an Italian Greyhound.


52
0:2:28,42 --> 0:2:30,46
My little Chihuahua really
likes them too.


53
0:2:30,46 --> 0:2:32,81
She would just sniff at them if
you have them in your hands


54
0:2:32,81 --> 0:2:34,27
when you're feeding them.


55
0:2:34,27 --> 0:2:37,7
I think they're about done
with us for today.


56
0:2:37,7 --> 0:2:39,44
They're going to go back to
sleep and wake up at 10:00.


57
0:2:39,44 --> 0:2:40,698
They don't want to play
with us anymore.


58
0:2:40,698 --> 0:4:40,698
