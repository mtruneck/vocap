0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:1,82



2
0:0:1,82 --> 0:0:3,22
STEVE SPANGLER: So
we're here at the


3
0:0:3,22 --> 0:0:4,47
Warner Brothers Studios.


4
0:0:4,47 --> 0:0:6,814
This is the home of
the Ellen set.


5
0:0:6,814 --> 0:0:7,796
Don't move, don't move.


6
0:0:7,796 --> 0:0:8,778
Here it comes.


7
0:0:8,778 --> 0:0:9,514
Here it comes.


8
0:0:9,514 --> 0:0:9,76
Ahh.


9
0:0:9,76 --> 0:0:12,215
Turn it upside down, put
it in the water.


10
0:0:12,215 --> 0:0:14,51
So I bet you think this is the
part of the show, where I'm


11
0:0:14,51 --> 0:0:17,3
going to say, don't try these
experiments at home.


12
0:0:17,3 --> 0:0:19,91
And you're right, except
there is one experiment


13
0:0:19,91 --> 0:0:20,65
we want you to try.


14
0:0:20,65 --> 0:0:22,41
Just look for the graphic
that's right here


15
0:0:22,41 --> 0:0:23,36
that says try it.


16
0:0:23,36 --> 0:0:25,26
That's your signal that
you can try that


17
0:0:25,26 --> 0:0:26,3
experiment at home.


18
0:0:26,3 --> 0:0:27,9
Everything else, off limits.


19
0:0:27,9 --> 0:0:30,142
Look, I've already given you
homework, and the show hasn't


20
0:0:30,142 --> 0:0:31,79
even started.


21
0:0:31,79 --> 0:0:34,77
I'm Steve Spangler and I'm all
about making science fun.


22
0:0:34,77 --> 0:0:37,77
For the last 20 years I've been
teaching ways to turn


23
0:0:37,77 --> 0:0:40,77
ordinary science experiments
into unforgettable learning


24
0:0:40,77 --> 0:0:41,79
experiences.


25
0:0:41,79 --> 0:0:44,43
I have an amazing team, who will
do whatever it takes to


26
0:0:44,43 --> 0:0:47,18
affect the way people
think about science.


27
0:0:47,18 --> 0:0:49,44
And to do that, I live
by one motto--


28
0:0:49,44 --> 0:0:52,42
make it big, do it right,
give it class.


29
0:0:52,42 --> 0:0:58,1
[MUSIC PLAYING]


30
0:0:58,1 --> 0:1:0,5
Well, we're here at DIA,
we are ready to go


31
0:1:0,5 --> 0:1:1,1
to the Ellen Show.


32
0:1:1,1 --> 0:1:2,61
It's a quick trip to Burbank.


33
0:1:2,61 --> 0:1:5,65
And now it's my job to just
practice the demos.


34
0:1:5,65 --> 0:1:7,99
So I figure I'll just flip
down the tray table and


35
0:1:7,99 --> 0:1:10,8
practice the demos that I'm
going to do on the show.


36
0:1:10,8 --> 0:1:13,52
I actually am her bodyguard,
I'm Carly's bodyguard.


37
0:1:13,52 --> 0:1:14,97
I speak into my arm.


38
0:1:14,97 --> 0:1:16,55
Sector one clear, sector
one clear.


39
0:1:16,55 --> 0:1:18,38
And I just make sure that
everything is fine.


40
0:1:18,38 --> 0:1:20,7
I always accompany her like
this, like she is a criminal.


41
0:1:20,7 --> 0:1:22,7
Usually I have to
take her hands.


42
0:1:22,7 --> 0:1:23,825
The other thing is
we've learned how


43
0:1:23,825 --> 0:1:25,3
to merge into traffic.


44
0:1:25,3 --> 0:1:27,176
So there's a correct
way to walk and a


45
0:1:27,176 --> 0:1:28,4
correct way not to walk.


46
0:1:28,4 --> 0:1:29,75
You'd better turn around,
because you're


47
0:1:29,75 --> 0:1:30,11
going to fall in.


48
0:1:30,11 --> 0:1:43,77
[MUSIC PLAYING]


49
0:1:43,77 --> 0:1:45,1
All right, we're here
at the airport.


50
0:1:45,1 --> 0:1:46,97
And, I think, I've got all the
demos figured out for the


51
0:1:46,97 --> 0:1:49,15
Ellen Show because of good
friend here, Lopez.


52
0:1:49,15 --> 0:1:49,44
All right.


53
0:1:49,44 --> 0:1:53,2
So he and I have discussed this,
and we know exactly what


54
0:1:53,2 --> 0:1:55,24
we're going to do on
the Ellen Show.


55
0:1:55,24 --> 0:1:57,25
Tell them what we're
going to do.


56
0:1:57,25 --> 0:1:59,77
LOPEZ: Well, I'm going
to wait and everybody


57
0:1:59,77 --> 0:2:0,71
else will see later.


58
0:2:0,71 --> 0:2:2,44
STEVE SPANGLER: That's right,
see he's a consummate


59
0:2:2,44 --> 0:2:4,55
professional, because he knows
you don't tell the


60
0:2:4,55 --> 0:2:5,91
demos ahead of time.


61
0:2:5,91 --> 0:2:7,371
You've got to tell
me the demo.


62
0:2:7,371 --> 0:2:8,832
But when you think of
it , you tell me.


63
0:2:8,832 --> 0:2:9,319
Because I've--


64
0:2:9,319 --> 0:2:19,8
[MUSIC PLAYING]


65
0:2:19,8 --> 0:2:20,97
So here we are in lovely
California.


66
0:2:20,97 --> 0:2:23,88
And I didn't realize this, but
look at the Hollywood sign.


67
0:2:23,88 --> 0:2:26,63
It is so much smaller
in person.


68
0:2:26,63 --> 0:2:27,915
And it's so big on TV.


69
0:2:27,915 --> 0:2:29,77
But look at those letters
right there.


70
0:2:29,77 --> 0:2:31,93
And right now, I think that it
would be a good idea for me to


71
0:2:31,93 --> 0:2:33,43
climb up in there and
I'm just going to--


72
0:2:33,43 --> 0:2:34,95
AIRPORT PORTER: Sir, it's
time for you to go.


73
0:2:34,95 --> 0:2:35,29
Please.


74
0:2:35,29 --> 0:2:36,94
STEVE SPANGLER: But I just
wanted to see the sign.


75
0:2:36,94 --> 0:2:38,26
AIRPORT PORTER: Well,
you see it, sir.


76
0:2:38,26 --> 0:2:39,57
Time for you to go.


77
0:2:39,57 --> 0:2:41,47
STEVE SPANGLER: OK, But I just
wanted to see the sign.


78
0:2:41,47 --> 0:2:44,464
I just wanted--


79
0:2:44,464 --> 0:2:47,24
Whenever we do the Ellen Show,
this is the time in the


80
0:2:47,24 --> 0:2:48,98
morning, when we sit down
and go through notes.


81
0:2:48,98 --> 0:2:51,42
So we do have notes.


82
0:2:51,42 --> 0:2:54,13
So going to kind of go through
all the demos, and just make


83
0:2:54,13 --> 0:2:55,81
sure that everything is
set, and so forth.


84
0:2:55,81 --> 0:2:58,41
And then, I'm sitting here at
the table with Carly and Jeff,


85
0:2:58,41 --> 0:3:2,9
and there's a ton of science
stuff that you can do.


86
0:3:2,9 --> 0:3:4,1
Anything that you can
find around you.


87
0:3:4,1 --> 0:3:4,73
So look what I've got.


88
0:3:4,73 --> 0:3:6,27
A little diaper time.


89
0:3:6,27 --> 0:3:9,72
If you can find yourself a
diaper, you have all the


90
0:3:9,72 --> 0:3:11,75
makings of a great little
experiment.


91
0:3:11,75 --> 0:3:14,61
Believe it or not, the secret
that makes these diapers super


92
0:3:14,61 --> 0:3:17,5
absorbent is this polymer
that's inside.


93
0:3:17,5 --> 0:3:19,68
So you are going to have to give
me a couple minutes here.


94
0:3:19,68 --> 0:3:22,62
But you rip open the diaper, and
then you kind of get the


95
0:3:22,62 --> 0:3:24,974
polymer out.


96
0:3:24,974 --> 0:3:25,43
Ah.


97
0:3:25,43 --> 0:3:27,52
See, you can start to even
see it coming out here.


98
0:3:27,52 --> 0:3:29,22
Watch this.


99
0:3:29,22 --> 0:3:31,38
See the powder that's
coming out?


100
0:3:31,38 --> 0:3:38,1
That powder is the polymer
that is super absorbent.


101
0:3:38,1 --> 0:3:38,86
OK, watch.


102
0:3:38,86 --> 0:3:40,84
So this goes into a cup.


103
0:3:40,84 --> 0:3:44,1
Here, we won't use all of it.


104
0:3:44,1 --> 0:3:44,4
Perfect.


105
0:3:44,4 --> 0:3:45,8
Watch this.


106
0:3:45,8 --> 0:3:48,2
Here is this water, watch.


107
0:3:48,2 --> 0:3:49,93
So here's what makes
it super absorbent.


108
0:3:49,93 --> 0:3:53,282
Watch, three, two, one.


109
0:3:53,282 --> 0:3:54,6
Isn't that awesome?


110
0:3:54,6 --> 0:3:57,38
So this is the material that's
in the diaper that causes it


111
0:3:57,38 --> 0:3:59,1
to become super absorbent.


112
0:3:59,1 --> 0:4:1,67
It's a polymer that absorbs
about 500 times


113
0:4:1,67 --> 0:4:2,73
its weight in water.


114
0:4:2,73 --> 0:4:6,81
So you can hide this, for
example, in the bottom of one


115
0:4:6,81 --> 0:4:8,57
of these cups.


116
0:4:8,57 --> 0:4:9,98
OK, see these cups here?


117
0:4:9,98 --> 0:4:10,88
They're perfect.


118
0:4:10,88 --> 0:4:15,25
So you just put this in
the bottom of a cup.


119
0:4:15,25 --> 0:4:15,512
OK.


120
0:4:15,512 --> 0:4:17,12
And so here's that powder.


121
0:4:17,12 --> 0:4:18,5
See, it's hiding here.


122
0:4:18,5 --> 0:4:20,79
So not this one goes on top,
a this one's here.


123
0:4:20,79 --> 0:4:22,36
And nobody knows it's there.


124
0:4:22,36 --> 0:4:23,76
Now you just have to
find somebody to


125
0:4:23,76 --> 0:4:25,8
play along with you.


126
0:4:25,8 --> 0:4:26,1
Look, it's Jack.


127
0:4:26,1 --> 0:4:27,93
Jack manages the club up here.


128
0:4:27,93 --> 0:4:30,16
And we've made kind of a mess,
but I want to show you


129
0:4:30,16 --> 0:4:30,82
something cool.


130
0:4:30,82 --> 0:4:32,49
And disregard most of this.


131
0:4:32,49 --> 0:4:34,46
And the fact when you
do this and you open


132
0:4:34,46 --> 0:4:35,61
this up, it goes tah-dah.


133
0:4:35,61 --> 0:4:36,87
Like this, see?


134
0:4:36,87 --> 0:4:38,29
This is a defect
in the bottle.


135
0:4:38,29 --> 0:4:40,27
There are actually holes in
the bottle like that.


136
0:4:40,27 --> 0:4:43,51
And that was her idea, so
that's her problem.


137
0:4:43,51 --> 0:4:44,52
But here, let me
show you this.


138
0:4:44,52 --> 0:4:45,45
This is very cool.


139
0:4:45,45 --> 0:4:47,71
All right, so have you ever
seen the three shell game?


140
0:4:47,71 --> 0:4:48,5
JACK: Sure.


141
0:4:48,5 --> 0:4:49,97
STEVE SPANGLER: You know where
you put the pea in one.


142
0:4:49,97 --> 0:4:51,3
OK, so watch this.


143
0:4:51,3 --> 0:4:53,17
You put the water here.


144
0:4:53,17 --> 0:4:54,4
OK, now.


145
0:4:54,4 --> 0:4:54,9
Here's what I'm going to do.


146
0:4:54,9 --> 0:4:56,42
I'm going to move them around.


147
0:4:56,42 --> 0:4:58,36
And you tell me where it is.


148
0:4:58,36 --> 0:4:59,79
Oops, it's not in that one.


149
0:4:59,79 --> 0:5:0,24
JACK: Yeah.


150
0:5:0,24 --> 0:5:0,69
STEVE SPANGLER: OK?


151
0:5:0,69 --> 0:5:0,91
All right.


152
0:5:0,91 --> 0:5:1,57
So you're ready?


153
0:5:1,57 --> 0:5:1,93
JACK: Aha.


154
0:5:1,93 --> 0:5:2,325
STEVE SPANGLER: All
right, watch this.


155
0:5:2,325 --> 0:5:3,73
It's going to be good.


156
0:5:3,73 --> 0:5:5,632
OK, here we go.


157
0:5:5,632 --> 0:5:6,63
OK, where is it?


158
0:5:6,63 --> 0:5:7,98
In the middle one, left
one, or right?


159
0:5:7,98 --> 0:5:11,41
Whoa, see you're watching
pretty closely.


160
0:5:11,41 --> 0:5:12,93
OK, I'm going to give you
a hint this time, ready?


161
0:5:12,93 --> 0:5:14,75
It's not in this one.


162
0:5:14,75 --> 0:5:15,65
You ready?


163
0:5:15,65 --> 0:5:16,63
Oh look, Elvis.


164
0:5:16,63 --> 0:5:18,1
STEVE SPANGLER: All right, so
now where do you think it is?


165
0:5:18,1 --> 0:5:20,18
Left, middle or right?


166
0:5:20,18 --> 0:5:22,77
Ah, see you're watching very,
very, very closely.


167
0:5:22,77 --> 0:5:25,597
All right, so this one here, I'm
going to give you, OK, you


168
0:5:25,597 --> 0:5:26,96
know where it is.


169
0:5:26,96 --> 0:5:27,89
OK, ready?


170
0:5:27,89 --> 0:5:28,34
Here we go.


171
0:5:28,34 --> 0:5:29,91
Right here.


172
0:5:29,91 --> 0:5:30,22
Right here.


173
0:5:30,22 --> 0:5:32,9
See, it's not in this, so
I did that on purpose.


174
0:5:32,9 --> 0:5:32,18
Ready?


175
0:5:32,18 --> 0:5:34,1
I'm doing this whole switcheroo
like this.


176
0:5:34,1 --> 0:5:35,165
Where do you think it is?


177
0:5:35,165 --> 0:5:37,45
Nope, not in this one, but
that's a good guess.


178
0:5:37,45 --> 0:5:38,6
OK, so now.


179
0:5:38,6 --> 0:5:39,35
Are you ready to keep going?


180
0:5:39,35 --> 0:5:39,78
Here we go.


181
0:5:39,78 --> 0:5:41,12
Here and here.


182
0:5:41,12 --> 0:5:42,52
Now where do you think it is?


183
0:5:42,52 --> 0:5:43,72
JACK: The middle.


184
0:5:43,72 --> 0:5:44,66
STEVE SPANGLER: OK,
not in the middle.


185
0:5:44,66 --> 0:5:45,25
No.


186
0:5:45,25 --> 0:5:46,14
OK, keep going.


187
0:5:46,14 --> 0:5:47,47
Right here, and here.


188
0:5:47,47 --> 0:5:48,28
Where you think it is?


189
0:5:48,28 --> 0:5:49,61
JACK: The middle.


190
0:5:49,61 --> 0:5:51,71
STEVE SPANGLER: OK,
that was close.


191
0:5:51,71 --> 0:5:52,72
Watch this one.


192
0:5:52,72 --> 0:5:54,175
See the water's gone.


193
0:5:54,175 --> 0:5:54,86
It's gone.


194
0:5:54,86 --> 0:5:55,692
Tah-dah.


195
0:5:55,692 --> 0:5:56,51
JACK: Wow.


196
0:5:56,51 --> 0:5:58,2
STEVE SPANGLER: See
is that cool?


197
0:5:58,2 --> 0:5:58,755
JACK: How did--


198
0:5:58,755 --> 0:5:59,803
you're not going to tell me.


199
0:5:59,803 --> 0:6:0,55
But, wow, that was great.


200
0:6:0,55 --> 0:6:1,78
STEVE SPANGLER: When you weren't
looking, I just went


201
0:6:1,78 --> 0:6:3,12
ah, and I drank it.


202
0:6:3,12 --> 0:6:5,16
It was perfect.


203
0:6:5,16 --> 0:6:5,32
JACK: Get out of here.


204
0:6:5,32 --> 0:6:5,87
STEVE SPANGLER: See?


205
0:6:5,87 --> 0:6:6,63
That's awesome.


206
0:6:6,63 --> 0:6:8,38
JACK: That was very,
very good.


207
0:6:8,38 --> 0:6:8,85
Very impressive.


208
0:6:8,85 --> 0:6:9,12
STEVE SPANGLER: Thanks, man.


209
0:6:9,12 --> 0:6:9,71
Very cool.


210
0:6:9,71 --> 0:6:12,1
There you go, now next time
you see a diaper--


211
0:6:12,1 --> 0:6:13,32
see it's a science
of a diaper.


212
0:6:13,32 --> 0:6:14,63
All right, cool.


213
0:6:14,63 --> 0:6:16,11
And, now you know.


214
0:6:16,11 --> 0:6:18,47
See how cool is this to be
able to do all of this.


215
0:6:18,47 --> 0:6:19,4
We are ready to go.


216
0:6:19,4 --> 0:6:22,325
We'll head to the studios here
in just a couple minutes.


217
0:6:22,325 --> 0:6:24,701
And nothing that we did this
morning will be on the show.


218
0:6:24,701 --> 0:6:30,16
[MUSIC PLAYING]


219
0:6:30,16 --> 0:6:31,16
STEVE SPANGLER: Well, here
we are backstage


220
0:6:31,16 --> 0:6:32,7
at the Ellen Show.


221
0:6:32,7 --> 0:6:35,59
Not everybody gets to see this
backstage area at the show.


222
0:6:35,59 --> 0:6:37,98
We are getting ready for the
big finale, so we're using


223
0:6:37,98 --> 0:6:40,36
this big, huge swimming pool.


224
0:6:40,36 --> 0:6:42,58
And logistically, you know,
you've got to work on things


225
0:6:42,58 --> 0:6:44,48
about how things are going to
move in and out of the show.


226
0:6:44,48 --> 0:6:46,64
So, these are the pros that
know how to make it work.


227
0:6:46,64 --> 0:6:49,2
I just stand here and wait for
them to say go, and we'll head


228
0:6:49,2 --> 0:6:50,6
into rehearsal.


229
0:6:50,6 --> 0:6:52,425
So, I think we've got the
cannon pressure set.


230
0:6:52,425 --> 0:6:58,81
[MUSIC PLAYING]


231
0:6:58,81 --> 0:7:0,11
STEVE SPANGLER: Look at this.


232
0:7:0,11 --> 0:7:1,65
This is nerd fest over here.


233
0:7:1,65 --> 0:7:2,23
Do you see this?


234
0:7:2,23 --> 0:7:5,845
See, she has to have a little
gun to make sure that the


235
0:7:5,845 --> 0:7:6,655
temperature is OK.


236
0:7:6,655 --> 0:7:7,65
It's ice water.


237
0:7:7,65 --> 0:7:13,77
[MUSIC PLAYING]


238
0:7:13,77 --> 0:7:15,93
STEVE SPANGLER: One of the
things I've learned from the


239
0:7:15,93 --> 0:7:18,27
people here at the Ellen Show is
not to telegraph things to


240
0:7:18,27 --> 0:7:19,9
the audience.


241
0:7:19,9 --> 0:7:20,54
So normally, as a teacher,
I'd just have


242
0:7:20,54 --> 0:7:21,65
everything sitting out there.


243
0:7:21,65 --> 0:7:23,787
But what I've learned is how
important it is to keep things


244
0:7:23,787 --> 0:7:24,73
as kind of a secret.


245
0:7:24,73 --> 0:7:27,45
So, when it's ready and they
say go, and they open the


246
0:7:27,45 --> 0:7:29,3
doors, everything kind of gets
moved into place, and the


247
0:7:29,3 --> 0:7:30,19
audience gets that
real reaction.


248
0:7:30,19 --> 0:7:34,6
The other thing that you have to
know is that Ellen doesn't


249
0:7:34,6 --> 0:7:36,67
want to see anything that has
to happen with the science


250
0:7:36,67 --> 0:7:39,55
experiments ahead of time, so
we keep things as shielded


251
0:7:39,55 --> 0:7:40,66
from her as possible.


252
0:7:40,66 --> 0:7:42,99
So it's completely a surprise
when she gets to see it.


253
0:7:42,99 --> 0:7:45,65
So when she's seeing it for the
first time, it's just like


254
0:7:45,65 --> 0:7:47,4
the audience seeing it
for the first time.


255
0:7:47,4 --> 0:7:49,38
It just means we've got to
practice a lot internally,


256
0:7:49,38 --> 0:7:51,156
making sure that we're OK.


257
0:7:51,156 --> 0:8:1,892
[MUSIC PLAYING]


258
0:8:1,892 --> 0:8:2,868
STEVE SPANGLER: All right,
it's go time.


259
0:8:2,868 --> 0:8:4,82
Let's see how it goes.


260
0:8:4,82 --> 0:8:5,796
Back this way.


261
0:8:5,796 --> 0:8:8,73
See you.


262
0:8:8,73 --> 0:8:12,34
ELLEN: I have safety glasses
ready and I have the fire


263
0:8:12,34 --> 0:8:13,75
marshal standing by.


264
0:8:13,75 --> 0:8:15,19
And that can only
mean one thing.


265
0:8:15,19 --> 0:8:17,36
Please welcome our science
guy, Steve Spangler.


266
0:8:17,36 --> 0:8:24,88

267
0:8:24,88 --> 0:8:24,566
STEVE SPANGLER: How are you?


268
0:8:24,566 --> 0:8:25,522
ELLEN: Oh I'm good.


269
0:8:25,522 --> 0:8:27,434
How are you?


270
0:8:27,434 --> 0:8:27,93
STEVE SPANGLER: I'm great.


271
0:8:27,93 --> 0:8:29,74
ELLEN: I never like to know
what's happening.


272
0:8:29,74 --> 0:8:31,57
I like to be surprised
with everybody else.


273
0:8:31,57 --> 0:8:32,58
So what are we doing today?


274
0:8:32,58 --> 0:8:34,23
STEVE SPANGLER: My socks
are from JC Penney's.


275
0:8:34,23 --> 0:8:35,39
ELLEN: Thank you very much.


276
0:8:35,39 --> 0:8:36,289
Thank you.


277
0:8:36,289 --> 0:8:39,22



278
0:8:39,22 --> 0:8:40,293
Thank you.


279
0:8:40,293 --> 0:8:41,919
STEVE SPANGLER: So I'm
fascinated with pendulums.


280
0:8:41,919 --> 0:8:43,26
I don't know about this,
but you probably


281
0:8:43,26 --> 0:8:44,49
are too, aren't you?


282
0:8:44,49 --> 0:8:44,45
ELLEN: Sure.


283
0:8:44,45 --> 0:8:44,54
STEVE SPANGLER: Yeah.


284
0:8:44,54 --> 0:8:47,93
So, maybe it's just the swinging
repetitive motion.


285
0:8:47,93 --> 0:8:49,26
Maybe I have nothing
to do in my life.


286
0:8:49,26 --> 0:8:49,74
But it's--


287
0:8:49,74 --> 0:8:50,33
I like that.


288
0:8:50,33 --> 0:8:52,4
And so I was thinking
why don't we do


289
0:8:52,4 --> 0:8:52,85
something with a pendulum.


290
0:8:52,85 --> 0:8:54,85
And so look, it's a bowling
ball attached to a


291
0:8:54,85 --> 0:8:55,78
great big huge rope.


292
0:8:55,78 --> 0:8:56,57
Come here, this will be fun.


293
0:8:56,57 --> 0:8:59,42
If I pull it back, and add some
energy to it, like when


294
0:8:59,42 --> 0:9:1,44
you're pushing a kid on the
playground, you know swinging


295
0:9:1,44 --> 0:9:3,87
the kid, you can make them go
higher than how you started.


296
0:9:3,87 --> 0:9:4,7
ELLEN: OK.


297
0:9:4,7 --> 0:9:4,98
STEVE SPANGLER: Which
could be dangerous.


298
0:9:4,98 --> 0:9:5,25
ELLEN: Yes.


299
0:9:5,25 --> 0:9:5,76
STEVE SPANGLER: Right?


300
0:9:5,76 --> 0:9:8,55
So that's why I have the
stand-in right over here.


301
0:9:8,55 --> 0:9:9,53
This is Mellon.


302
0:9:9,53 --> 0:9:10,474
ELLEN: Hi, Mellon.


303
0:9:10,474 --> 0:9:12,16
STEVE SPANGLER: And,
Mellon meet Ellen.


304
0:9:12,16 --> 0:9:14,8



305
0:9:14,8 --> 0:9:14,99
Awkward.


306
0:9:14,99 --> 0:9:15,93
ELLEN: And how do you
know it's going to


307
0:9:15,93 --> 0:9:17,17
come exactly back?


308
0:9:17,17 --> 0:9:17,54
STEVE SPANGLER: I don't.


309
0:9:17,54 --> 0:9:18,82
I just saw this on
the Internet.


310
0:9:18,82 --> 0:9:20,162
ELLEN: I see.


311
0:9:20,162 --> 0:9:21,49
STEVE SPANGLER: This is what I
was thinking is I want you to


312
0:9:21,49 --> 0:9:23,87
stand in the place
of Mellon, OK?


313
0:9:23,87 --> 0:9:24,27
ELLEN: No.


314
0:9:24,27 --> 0:9:26,39
So, it's fine.


315
0:9:26,39 --> 0:9:27,93
You don't have to worry
about that at all.


316
0:9:27,93 --> 0:9:28,93
ELLEN: I'm not going
to do that.


317
0:9:28,93 --> 0:9:30,37
STEVE SPANGLER: But if you had
a friend who wanted to?


318
0:9:30,37 --> 0:9:31,62
Lauren, come on out here.


319
0:9:31,62 --> 0:9:34,14

0:9:34,14 --> 0:9:35,38
STEVE SPANGLER: Ah, this
is so awesome.


321
0:9:35,38 --> 0:9:37,7
So if you stand right here like
this, I'm going to go get


322
0:9:37,7 --> 0:9:38,4
the bowling ball.


323
0:9:38,4 --> 0:9:39,4
I'll be right back, OK?


324
0:9:39,4 --> 0:9:41,16
All right, so now watch.


325
0:9:41,16 --> 0:9:42,125
If I bring this right--


326
0:9:42,125 --> 0:9:42,89
LAUREN: Oh boy.


327
0:9:42,89 --> 0:9:44,24
STEVE SPANGLER: --to your
face, like this.


328
0:9:44,24 --> 0:9:45,21
Let's see it to your nose.


329
0:9:45,21 --> 0:9:46,64
See how it's touching
right there.


330
0:9:46,64 --> 0:9:48,88
And then I let go, it should
not come back and hit you.


331
0:9:48,88 --> 0:9:50,53
Now if you move, it could
be dangerous.


332
0:9:50,53 --> 0:9:52,94
So that's why this wall is going
to come in behind you.


333
0:9:52,94 --> 0:9:53,75
All right, so here we go.


334
0:9:53,75 --> 0:9:54,53
Watch this.


335
0:9:54,53 --> 0:9:55,21
Bring in the wall.


336
0:9:55,21 --> 0:9:55,68
Keep coming.


337
0:9:55,68 --> 0:9:56,8
Keep coming.


338
0:9:56,8 --> 0:9:56,246

339
0:9:56,246 --> 0:9:56,313
It's been great.


340
0:9:56,313 --> 0:9:56,48
Thank you for having me.


341
0:9:56,48 --> 0:9:58,7
STEVE SPANGLER: Keep the-- right
there, oh it's perfect.


342
0:9:58,7 --> 0:10:1,5
So now, I'm going to bring
it right to your nose,


343
0:10:1,5 --> 0:10:1,79
and it'll be great.


344
0:10:1,79 --> 0:10:2,95
All right.


345
0:10:2,95 --> 0:10:6,95
And this is for me, just in
case, because I have more


346
0:10:6,95 --> 0:10:8,72
experiments to do, all right?


347
0:10:8,72 --> 0:10:9,97

348
0:10:9,97 --> 0:10:11,84

0:10:11,84 --> 0:10:12,78
Here it goes.


350
0:10:12,78 --> 0:10:13,315
Don't move.


351
0:10:13,315 --> 0:10:14,596
Don't move.


352
0:10:14,596 --> 0:10:15,94
Here it comes.

Here it comes.

[APPLAUSE]


359
0:10:25,7 --> 0:10:26,38
STEVE SPANGLER: What I was
thinking was is there another


360
0:10:26,38 --> 0:10:28,49
way to crush a can that
would be better?


361
0:10:28,49 --> 0:10:29,81
And this is it, all right?


362
0:10:29,81 --> 0:10:31,64
So I've taken the cans
here, these cans.


363
0:10:31,64 --> 0:10:33,74
And I put a little bit of water
into each of the cans.


364
0:10:33,74 --> 0:10:36,4
So I'm cooking them on our
little stove here.


365
0:10:36,4 --> 0:10:38,71
If we turn it upside down into
this colder water that's here,


366
0:10:38,71 --> 0:10:40,89
you're going to allow the air
pressure to crush the can.


367
0:10:40,89 --> 0:10:42,4
All right, so which one do
you want Sprite or Coke?


368
0:10:42,4 --> 0:10:42,64
Which one?


369
0:10:42,64 --> 0:10:43,71
ELLEN: I'll take Sprite.

STEVE SPANGLER: Bingo.


371
0:10:44,1 --> 0:10:45,9
All right, so now you're going
to pick up like this, hold it


372
0:10:45,9 --> 0:10:47,446
like this, and turn it
upside down, and


373
0:10:47,446 --> 0:10:48,18
put it into the water.


374
0:10:48,18 --> 0:10:48,68
ELLEN: All right.


375
0:10:48,68 --> 0:10:50,36
STEVE SPANGLER: Turn it upside
down, put it in the water.


376
0:10:50,36 --> 0:10:51,17
That was a nice one.


377
0:10:51,17 --> 0:10:52,61
Look at that power
that's there.


378
0:10:52,61 --> 0:10:52,83
ELLEN: Wow.


379
0:10:52,83 --> 0:10:53,62
That's amazing.


380
0:10:53,62 --> 0:10:55,18
STEVE SPANGLER: But I was
thinking, this is your big


381
0:10:55,18 --> 0:10:57,85
show, and you would never allow
just that to happen.


382
0:10:57,85 --> 0:10:59,96
So when I was thinking, I
thought what if we did it with


383
0:10:59,96 --> 0:11:3,47
a 55-gallon steel
drum, all right?


384
0:11:3,47 --> 0:11:5,11
Because who doesn't want
to crush one those?


385
0:11:5,11 --> 0:11:6,29
ELLEN: Everyone needs to.


386
0:11:6,29 --> 0:11:7,9
STEVE SPANGLER: Look at
this set up here.


387
0:11:7,9 --> 0:11:8,25
This is going to be
really great.


388
0:11:8,25 --> 0:11:9,5
ELLEN: Ah, yep.


389
0:11:9,5 --> 0:11:11,59
STEVE SPANGLER: So here's
what we have going here.


390
0:11:11,59 --> 0:11:14,24
We have a 55-gallon
steel drum.


391
0:11:14,24 --> 0:11:17,39
As he caps it off now, no more
air inside, just that steam.


392
0:11:17,39 --> 0:11:20,7
And the molecules are going to
go from 1,700 times farther


393
0:11:20,7 --> 0:11:21,83
away from each other
then close by.


394
0:11:21,83 --> 0:11:22,925
And see the swimming pool?


395
0:11:22,925 --> 0:11:24,9
Some cold water.


396
0:11:24,9 --> 0:11:26,38
Jeff, will you pour some
water on it for me?


397
0:11:26,38 --> 0:11:28,91
So now, watch this, where you
just have the air pressure


398
0:11:28,91 --> 0:11:30,7
pushing on it.

0:11:30,7 --> 0:11:33,636

0:11:49,18 --> 0:11:50,34
It's just kind of crushing.


408
0:11:50,34 --> 0:11:52,66
The same kind of thing that
we're trying to do to get kids


409
0:11:52,66 --> 0:11:54,67
excited, whether it's online
or on YouTube, or any other


410
0:11:54,67 --> 0:11:55,38
way they we're doing it.


411
0:11:55,38 --> 0:11:56,65
ELLEN: Well it's always
a lot of fun, Steve.


412
0:11:56,65 --> 0:11:59,34

417
0:12:12,257 --> 0:12:13,243
STEVE SPANGLER: It crushed.


418
0:12:13,243 --> 0:12:15,215
Bam, and we got it down.


419
0:12:15,215 --> 0:12:17,68
And the bowling ball didn't
smack her in the face.


420
0:12:17,68 --> 0:12:19,159
I say it's good.


421
0:12:19,159 --> 0:12:22,62
