CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: You`ve got one day
before the U.S. chooses its leader for the


2
0:0:4,39 --> 0:0:8,91
next four years. You`ve got one hour of extra
sleep thanks to a time switch, and we`ve got


3
0:0:8,91 --> 0:0:13,9
one show that will bring you coverage of both
events in the next ten minutes. Welcome to


4
0:0:13,9 --> 0:0:15,39
CNN STUDENT NEWS.

0:0:15,39 --> 0:0:18,56
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


6
0:0:18,56 --> 0:0:30,789
BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA: After four years as president,


7
0:0:30,789 --> 0:0:31,67
you know me.


8
0:0:31,67 --> 0:0:32,5
AUDIENCE: Yes!


9
0:0:32,5 --> 0:0:37,41
OBAMA: You may not agree with every decision
I`ve made, you may at times have been frustrated


10
0:0:37,41 --> 0:0:42,41
by the pace of change, but you know what I
believe. You know where I stand. You know


11
0:0:42,41 --> 0:0:46,35
I tell the truth. And you know I`ll fight
for you and your families every single day.


12
0:0:46,35 --> 0:0:50,0
MITT ROMNEY, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:
The same path we`re on means $20 trillion


13
0:0:50,0 --> 0:0:55,78
in debt in four years. It means crippling
unemployment continues. It means stagnant


14
0:0:55,78 --> 0:1:0,86
take home pay, depressed home values. And
a devastated military.


15
0:1:0,86 --> 0:1:4,969
OBAMA: Our fight goes on, Virginia, because
-- because we know this nation can`t succeed


16
0:1:4,969 --> 0:1:11,67
without a growing, thriving middle class.


17
0:1:11,67 --> 0:1:16,139
Our fight goes on because America`s always
done best when everybody has a fair shot.


18
0:1:16,139 --> 0:1:20,95
And everybody is doing their fair share, and
everybody is playing by the same rules.


19
0:1:20,95 --> 0:1:22,52
ROMNEY: If you believe we can do better ...


20
0:1:22,52 --> 0:1:22,7
(cheers)


21
0:1:22,7 --> 0:1:25,719
ROMNEY: If you believe America should be on
a better course ...


22
0:1:25,719 --> 0:1:26,439
AUDIENCE: Yes!


23
0:1:26,439 --> 0:1:28,84
ROMNEY: If you are tired of being tired ...


24
0:1:28,84 --> 0:1:29,259
AUDIENCE: Yes!


25
0:1:29,259 --> 0:1:34,29
ROMNEY: Then I ask you to vote and work for
real change, because Paul Ryan and I are going


26
0:1:34,29 --> 0:1:37,27
to bring real change to America from the day
one.


27

28
0:1:38,9 --> 0:1:42,74
AZUZ: If you think there were a lot of stops
on that map, it`s not even the half of it.


29
0:1:42,74 --> 0:1:48,219
Ohio, Wisconsin, Virginia, Colorado, Iowa,
New Hampshire, Florida, Pennsylvania -- the


30
0:1:48,219 --> 0:1:53,39
candidates are campaigning hard in states
that could go either way tomorrow. One of


31
0:1:53,39 --> 0:1:56,399
the things that we are talking about this
weekend was a report that came out on Friday.


32
0:1:56,399 --> 0:2:3,259
It said the U.S. economy added 171,000 jobs
in October. But that the nation`s unemployment


33
0:2:3,259 --> 0:2:9,119
rate went up slightly, to 7.9 percent. The
candidates focused on different parts of that


34
0:2:9,119 --> 0:2:13,7
report. President Obama referred to the added
jobs and said it shows that the economy is


35
0:2:13,7 --> 0:2:18,67
improving. Governor Romney looked at the unemployment
rate and said it shows the economy is at a


36
0:2:18,67 --> 0:2:24,15
standstill. The CNN election center is packed
with interactive resources that can help you


37
0:2:24,15 --> 0:2:26,42
get geared up for election day. Check this
out.

MANAV TANNEERU, SENIOR PRODUCER, CNN.COM:
This is Manav Tanneeru, I`m a senior producer


40
0:2:29,6 --> 0:2:33,89
at CNN.COM. And I`m here to tell you about
a couple of features we have at out Web site,


41
0:2:33,89 --> 0:2:40,27
that might help you get a better idea about
the election that`s coming around. One of


42
0:2:40,27 --> 0:2:45,43
them is what we call the CNN electoral map.
It allows you to game out the presidential


43
0:2:45,43 --> 0:2:50,65
race by assigning different states to different
candidates. The point of it is, to see who


44
0:2:50,65 --> 0:2:56,27
gets the 270 electoral votes first. Now, after
you make your selection and you come with


45
0:2:56,27 --> 0:3:2,16
a prediction, you can share with the family
and friends, the social media, email, different


46
0:3:2,16 --> 0:3:2,88
methods.


47
0:3:2,88 --> 0:3:7,47
Another feature we have is called the CNN
Campaign Explorer. We work with Google on


48
0:3:7,47 --> 0:3:12,82
this feature. And it shows you different types
of data. It allows you to take a glance at


49
0:3:12,82 --> 0:3:18,87
fundraising data, ad spending data, candidate
travel, and also polling. The last feature


50
0:3:18,87 --> 0:3:23,84
we have is our polling interactive. It shows
you CNN poll of polls for the national race


51
0:3:23,84 --> 0:3:28,64
and different battleground states like Ohio,
and Florida and Colorado and Nevada. States


52
0:3:28,64 --> 0:3:49,12
you have heard a lot about in this presidential
election.

54
0:4:7,34 --> 0:4:23,84
AZUZ: It`s been one week since the storm Sandy
hit land. You`ve seen pictures of the devastation,


55
0:4:23,84 --> 0:4:29,8
but what`s incredible, is to compare it to
what these areas looked like before the storm.


56
0:4:29,8 --> 0:4:34,9
Like this New Jersey Pier, before totally
intact, after parts of it just ripped away.


57
0:4:34,9 --> 0:4:40,9
We are seeing these kinds of before and after
images from up and down the coast. Originally,


58
0:4:40,9 --> 0:4:44,6
analysts were predicting that Sandy might
cause $10 billion to $20 billion in damages.


59
0:4:44,6 --> 0:4:49,449
Now, they are estimating between 30 and 50
billion. The victims of these storm are dealing


60
0:4:49,449 --> 0:4:54,29
with all kinds of challenges, some things
are starting to get back to normal. For example,


61
0:4:54,29 --> 0:4:58,529
New York City`s public schools are opening
back up today. But millions of people still


62
0:4:58,529 --> 0:5:3,319
didn`t have power yesterday. No power means
no heat, and with the temperature dropping


63
0:5:3,319 --> 0:5:8,36
New York officials say tens of thousands of
people will have to find other housing options.


64
0:5:8,36 --> 0:5:13,2
Gasoline has also been in short supply. The
U.S. Defense Department is planning to bring


65
0:5:13,2 --> 0:5:17,219
more in, but some residents have stood in
line for hours waiting to fill up.


66
0:5:17,219 --> 0:5:18,199
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


67
0:5:18,199 --> 0:5:22,789
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We saw the truck pulling
here, we are like, get the cans out, because


68
0:5:22,789 --> 0:5:24,24
it`s better than waiting in the car.


69
0:5:24,24 --> 0:5:27,77
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I ran out of gas, looking
for gas. So I walked here.


70
0:5:27,77 --> 0:5:30,779
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right now, I`m just kind
of waiting it out. I think in a few more days,


71
0:5:30,779 --> 0:5:33,419
hopefully, there will be fuel and all the
stuff will ease up.


72
0:5:33,419 --> 0:5:33,96
(END VIDEO CLIP)


73
0:5:33,96 --> 0:5:37,529
AZUZ: New York City`s subway tunnels were
flooded during the storm. System is coming


74
0:5:37,529 --> 0:5:42,319
back online, but when Jason Carroll went to
look at the damage with the subway official,


75
0:5:42,319 --> 0:5:44,879
he found out some sections still need a lot
of work.


76
0:5:44,879 --> 0:5:45,49
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


77
0:5:45,49 --> 0:5:48,249
JASON CARROLL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: What is
it exactly that you`ll be doing down here,


78
0:5:48,249 --> 0:5:51,719
because this is in the area clearly were you
are working now. I mean it`s ...


79
0:5:51,719 --> 0:5:54,62
FRANK JEZYCKI, CHIEF INFRASTRUCTURE OFFICER,
MTA: Well, the station complex itself will


80
0:5:54,62 --> 0:6:3,209
require a significant rehabilitation due to
the damage from the storm. The infrastructure


81
0:6:3,209 --> 0:6:11,539
-- the electrical systems, the fare collection
systems. The lighting systems. The stairways,


82
0:6:11,539 --> 0:6:16,849
the ventilation systems, the elevators, the
escalators, they are all pretty much ruined


83
0:6:16,849 --> 0:6:19,3
from the water damage, from the surge damage.


84
0:6:19,3 --> 0:6:20,559

85
0:6:20,559 --> 0:6:25,539
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Today`s "Shoutout" goes
out to Ms. Holt`s classes at Westbrook Walnut


86
0:6:25,539 --> 0:6:31,52
Grove High School in Westbrook, Minnesota.
During which war did the U.S. first practice


87
0:6:31,52 --> 0:6:38,24
daylight-saving time? Here we go, was it the
Civil War, World War One, Spanish-American


88
0:6:38,24 --> 0:6:46,249
War or World War II? You`ve got three seconds,
go!


89
0:6:46,249 --> 0:6:53,24
The U.S. first observed daylight saving time
during World War I. That`s your answer and


90
0:6:53,24 --> 0:6:55,15
that`s your "Shoutout."


91
0:6:55,15 --> 0:6:57,69
(END VIDEO CLIP)


92
0:6:57,69 --> 0:7:2,369
AZUZ: But the idea of daylight saving goes
back further than that. Back in the 1700s,


93
0:7:2,369 --> 0:7:7,289
Ben Franklin suggested getting up earlier
in order to use fewer candles. So that covers


94
0:7:7,289 --> 0:7:11,639
the who and the when. As for why and where
this happens around the world, here is Reynolds


95
0:7:11,639 --> 0:7:11,759
Wolf.


96
0:7:11,759 --> 0:7:12,139
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


97
0:7:12,139 --> 0:7:16,86
REYNOLDS WOLF, CNN CORRESPONDENT: This is
not a complex issue. Daylight saving is basically


98
0:7:16,86 --> 0:7:21,969
self-explanatory, it`s saving daylight.


99
0:7:21,969 --> 0:7:28,639
Originally, daylight saving was one of those
things where it was -- originally for agrarian


100
0:7:28,639 --> 0:7:33,99
societies, it was to use the -- get the most
use out of as much daylight as you possibly


101
0:7:33,99 --> 0:7:37,479
could. It was certainly helpful with farmers,
certainly helpful with fisherman. But then


102
0:7:37,479 --> 0:7:43,89
later, in later years it actually began -- daylight
saving was actually practiced for the sole


103
0:7:43,89 --> 0:7:47,779
purpose of really saving energy.


104
0:7:47,779 --> 0:7:53,59
We`ve been following daylight saving time
in the United States for quite a while. It


105
0:7:53,59 --> 0:7:57,49
really first became official back during World
War I for the sake of growing extra food for


106
0:7:57,49 --> 0:8:2,77
troops overseas. It was brought back for World
War II. But recently, it was the Energy Policy


107
0:8:2,77 --> 0:8:8,369
Act of 2005 that was the real difference maker
that made it more of a formal type of exercise


108
0:8:8,369 --> 0:8:12,569
that has been basically followed by every
state in the United States with a few exceptions


109
0:8:12,569 --> 0:8:18,46
that, being, of course, Arizona, Hawaii, U.S.
Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico and the American


110
0:8:18,46 --> 0:8:19,74
Samoa.


111
0:8:19,74 --> 0:8:25,999
Internationally, it`s kind of a hodgepodge
around the globe. If you took a look at the


112
0:8:25,999 --> 0:8:29,619
planet, and you were to light up places that
were experiencing daylight saving, you`d see


113
0:8:29,619 --> 0:8:33,55
really just a hop, skip and a jump from one
continent to the other. It`s kind of varied


114
0:8:33,55 --> 0:8:34,56
where you happen to go.


115
0:8:34,56 --> 0:8:38,51
There are some places, I can tell you in Africa
where there are many spots they don`t practice


116
0:8:38,51 --> 0:8:44,26
it. There are many places, obviously, in parts
of Asia. Europe, though, practices it for


117
0:8:44,26 --> 0:8:47,17
the most part.


118
0:8:47,17 --> 0:8:50,79
OK, now we are getting to the nitty-gritty
stuff. This is the stuff that drives people


119
0:8:50,79 --> 0:8:56,65
crazy. To me, it`s daylight saving. It`s a
verb, it`s something we are doing. We are


120
0:8:56,65 --> 0:9:0,2
saving daylight. Savings is a noun, that`s
something that you have in the bank. Obviously,


121
0:9:0,2 --> 0:9:3,72
we are using the verb.


122
0:9:3,72 --> 0:9:9,5
It`s very possible that at some point we may
indeed get rid of daylight saving time, but


123
0:9:9,5 --> 0:9:13,7
for the time being, it is certainly here,
and something we got to deal with, for better


124
0:9:13,7 --> 0:9:13,33
or for worse.


125
0:9:13,33 --> 0:9:14,8
(END VIDEO CLIP)


126
0:9:14,8 --> 0:9:18,45
AZUZ: On Halloween, a 14-year old in Oregon
elected to fight the bitterness of politics


127
0:9:18,45 --> 0:9:24,32
with a sweet political costume. He went out
as a ballot box, the left side was for Obama,


128
0:9:24,32 --> 0:9:29,44
the right side for Romney. His neighbors voted
by putting candy in the side they like more.


129
0:9:29,44 --> 0:9:34,6
And they could vote multiple times. So, no
matter who got the most votes, this kid won.


130
0:9:34,6 --> 0:9:38,99
He said there was a five percent margin of
error for any candy he ate while trick-or-treating,


131
0:9:38,99 --> 0:9:44,7
not to mention the fact that he wanted people
to vote early and vote often, to totally stuff


132
0:9:44,7 --> 0:9:47,25
the ballot box. To sweeten the pot for their
favorite candy dip.


133
0:9:47,25 --> 0:9:50,81
There is no real harm in it, though, when
you think about it. The only potential corruption


134
0:9:50,81 --> 0:9:52,14
could have been to his teeth.


135
0:9:52,14 --> 0:11:52,14
We hope you answer the door when CNN STUDENT
NEWS knocks again tomorrow. See you then.
