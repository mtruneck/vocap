You know it's a Creole
culture.

people need to understand is

that Louisiana is Creole.

Creole that you know about,

it's the same Creole that's
here from Haiti.

and rice, baby.

at this snapper.


72
0:2:24,66 --> 0:2:28,73
Hey look, this ain't just
snapper that we just take, put


73
0:2:28,73 --> 0:2:30,92
it under hot water and give
it to the people.

say, Chef, when he cooks he


84
0:2:47,66 --> 0:2:48,79
puts his foot in it.

compliment someone could

foot in the shit.

up in the guts.

in life, you got to

build your army.

And your army is what you call
your support system.


108

EDDIE HUANG: Yeah.


109
0:3:35,26 --> 0:3:37,58
CHEF CREOLE: The best support
system you could have is


110
0:3:37,58 --> 0:3:39,87
grassroots.


111
0:3:39,87 --> 0:3:43,25
If for some reason you're not
pleased with the next level--


112
0:3:43,25 --> 0:3:45,23
you're like, look guys, this
is a little bit too


113
0:3:45,23 --> 0:3:46,49
superficial for me.


114
0:3:46,49 --> 0:3:48,7
EDDIE HUANG: Look at you,
you've got the promo!


115

to be shunned out.

Because the first adopters, they
will always keep it real.

They'll always get your back.


121

EDDIE HUANG: You nailed
it on the head, man.


122
0:3:59,94 --> 0:4:2,38
The grassroots and your first
supporters-- those are the


123
0:4:2,38 --> 0:4:3,2
people you do it for.


124
0:4:3,2 --> 0:4:4,96
That's your family.


125
0:4:4,96 --> 0:4:7,4
The other thing I wanted
to ask you about is


126
0:4:7,4 --> 0:4:8,67
gentrification, right?


127
0:4:8,67 --> 0:4:12,4
I really want to see it happen
with people like you opening


128
0:4:12,4 --> 0:4:12,75
Chef Creole's.


129
0:4:12,75 --> 0:4:14,9
Serving the community
that's here.


130
0:4:14,9 --> 0:4:17,504
Providing an environment that
other people can also enjoy.


131
0:4:17,504 --> 0:4:18,1
CHEF CREOLE: Right.


132
0:4:18,1 --> 0:4:20,829
EDDIE HUANG: But it's very, very
evident from jump, when


133
0:4:20,829 --> 0:4:25,65
you come to Chef Creole, who
that restaurant is inspired by


134
0:4:25,65 --> 0:4:28,39
and who you are paying
tribute to, and


135
0:4:28,39 --> 0:4:29,43
they will never change.


136
0:4:29,43 --> 0:4:30,795
Because he got money.


137
0:4:30,795 --> 0:4:31,65
He got money.


138
0:4:31,65 --> 0:4:32,385
He look expensive.


139
0:4:32,385 --> 0:4:34,526
-See that stomach right there?


140
0:4:34,526 --> 0:4:36,96
That stomach is expensive.


141
0:4:36,96 --> 0:4:39,6
But for these prices, I tell
you, I'm fed and we're good.


142
0:4:39,6 --> 0:4:41,78
The family is here,
everyone's here.


143
0:4:41,78 --> 0:4:44,0
The family over here,
family over here.


144
0:4:44,0 --> 0:4:46,1
EDDIE HUANG: And I think
that's the thing with


145
0:4:46,1 --> 0:4:48,1
gentrification that people
have to remember.


146
0:4:48,1 --> 0:4:49,49
It's like, who came before?


147
0:4:49,49 --> 0:4:51,55
What are the traditions
of this neighborhood?


148
0:4:51,55 --> 0:4:53,96
How can we come in and
integrate into this


149
0:4:53,96 --> 0:4:56,26
neighborhood, not come
in and take it over.


150
0:4:56,26 --> 0:4:58,87
Do it in a way that everyone
can participate, because


151
0:4:58,87 --> 0:5:0,35
that's what you do with
your restaurant.


152
0:5:0,35 --> 0:5:3,77
CHEF CREOLE: Something that I
would normally sell for $12, I


153
0:5:3,77 --> 0:5:6,43
would turn around and say look,
we're in the 'hood.


154
0:5:6,43 --> 0:5:8,18
We're in the 'hood.


155
0:5:8,18 --> 0:5:11,54
I'm going to run a
special, $4.99.


156
0:5:11,54 --> 0:5:13,33
Now we're talking business.


157
0:5:13,33 --> 0:5:18,43
Now you've got the people that
encompasses that area, now


158
0:5:18,43 --> 0:5:19,535
you've got them involved.

investing.


160
0:5:20,82 --> 0:5:24,276

these people.

beautiful, man.

to start and we're going to


181
0:6:5,97 --> 0:6:6,635
get out of here, man.


182
0:6:6,635 --> 0:6:9,11
We're going to go in the
water and get some


183
0:6:9,11 --> 0:6:9,64
real natural salt.


184
0:6:9,64 --> 0:6:10,94
You know what I mean?

0:6:23,8 --> 0:6:24,28
Everything's better
on the water.


188

CHEF CREOLE: Everything's
better on the water.

All the negativity that followed
you jumped off a


190

bridge away because they knew
you were coming here.


191
0:6:31,865 --> 0:6:33,736

my producer's still here.

You see it?

three, four, five, six, and we


198

got seven on the--

put chefs on "Fresh Off


203

get into culture in ways


204
0:7:23,33 --> 0:7:26,16
outside of the restaurant,
outside of chefs.


205
0:7:26,16 --> 0:7:29,52
But sometimes the best
way into a story


206
0:7:29,52 --> 0:7:30,85
is a chef, you know?


207
0:7:30,85 --> 0:7:33,4
This dude grew up on
these streets.


208
0:7:33,4 --> 0:7:33,97
He reps it hard.


209
0:7:33,97 --> 0:7:35,8
He reps his family.


210
0:7:35,8 --> 0:7:36,97
And I feel blessed just
to be a part of it.


211
0:7:36,97 --> 0:7:39,92
To come and see how in a lot
of ways they've kind of


212
0:7:39,92 --> 0:7:43,955
recreated their own
Haiti in Miami.


213
0:7:43,955 --> 0:7:46,86
And that's the goal of the
show is to try to go find


214
0:7:46,86 --> 0:7:47,65
these underdogs.


215
0:7:47,65 --> 0:7:50,17
Try to go find these stories
that other people thought were


216
0:7:50,17 --> 0:7:51,62
inappropriate for food shows.


217
0:7:51,62 --> 0:7:53,2
This is how people live.


218
0:7:53,2 --> 0:7:54,22
This is how people eat.


219
0:7:54,22 --> 0:7:56,38
This is how culture is created,


220
0:7:56,38 --> 0:7:57,43
preserved, and survived.


221
0:7:57,43 --> 0:7:59,78
So I hope you all enjoyed it.


222
0:7:59,78 --> 0:8:0,83
I hope you all enjoyed Miami.


223
0:8:0,83 --> 0:8:3,62
And I hope overall you all enjoy
the real life reality


224
0:8:3,62 --> 0:8:5,94
that we give you on "Fresh
Off the Boat." All right?


225
0:8:5,94 --> 0:8:8,19
It's your boy, Eddie Huang.


226
0:8:8,19 --> 0:8:9,155
We out.


227
0:8:9,155 --> 0:8:52,22
