NATISHA LANCE, CNN ANCHOR: It is Monday, and
that means it`s a new week of CNN STUDENT


2
0:0:4,27 --> 0:0:8,469
NEWS. Hi there, everyone. I`m Natisha Lance,
in for Carl today. And we`re taking you from


3
0:0:8,469 --> 0:0:26,109
the Middle East to Southeast Asia, so let`s
get going.


4
0:0:26,109 --> 0:0:30,5
First up today, we`re looking at the increased
fighting between the Israelis and Palestinians.


5
0:0:30,5 --> 0:0:35,129
Representatives from other countries are trying
to work out a cease-fire to stop the violence,


6
0:0:35,129 --> 0:0:39,589
but until that happens, millions of people
from both sides are in harm`s ways. The attacks


7
0:0:39,589 --> 0:0:43,979
are mostly made up of two things -- that`s
Israeli air strikes and Palestinian rockets.


8
0:0:43,979 --> 0:0:47,469
And those rockets, like the ones that are
being launched right here, those are fired


9
0:0:47,469 --> 0:0:53,79
at Israel from Gaza. That`s a Palestinian-controlled
territory. Israel says the air strikes it


10
0:0:53,79 --> 0:0:58,459
launched at Gaza are aimed at terrorist targets,
including leaders of Hamas. That`s an organization


11
0:0:58,459 --> 0:1:2,559
that runs the Palestinian government in Gaza,
and it`s been labeled as a terrorist group


12
0:1:2,559 --> 0:1:4,21
by the U.S. government.


13
0:1:4,21 --> 0:1:8,31
The U.S. and some European nations say Hamas
should get most of the blame for the current


14
0:1:8,31 --> 0:1:14,9
crisis, but most Arab and Muslim nations,
though, have accused Israel of being the aggressor,


15
0:1:14,9 --> 0:1:18,6
or the one who attacked first. Tom Foreman
breaks down some of the comparisons between


16
0:1:18,6 --> 0:1:19,42
the two sides in this conflict.


17
0:1:19,42 --> 0:1:20,7
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


18
0:1:20,7 --> 0:1:23,71
TOM FOREMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Let`s look
at how the battlefield is shaping up over


19
0:1:23,71 --> 0:1:27,329
in the Middle East. Here is Israel alongside
the Mediterranean. It`s about the size of


20
0:1:27,329 --> 0:1:33,1
New Jersey. 7.5 million people, 75 percent
Jewish. The economy is good, unemployment


21
0:1:33,1 --> 0:1:39,59
below 7 percent. Gaza by comparison geographically
very small, only about twice as big as Washington,


22
0:1:39,59 --> 0:1:44,219
D.C., predominately Palestinian. The economy
there is quite bad and unemployment is very


23
0:1:44,219 --> 0:1:45,9
high.


24
0:1:45,9 --> 0:1:51,79
Globalfirepower.com has called Israel the
tenth most powerful military in the world,


25
0:1:51,79 --> 0:1:55,84
so let`s break that down and see why. They
have compulsory military service, that means


26
0:1:55,84 --> 0:2:2,289
every young person must go into the military
for a while. 176,000 active troops are available


27
0:2:2,289 --> 0:2:5,869
and they have about half a million that they
can call up from the reserves very quickly.


28
0:2:5,869 --> 0:2:10,479
Ground forces, also impressive. Some 3,000
tanks. If you count all the artillery pieces


29
0:2:10,479 --> 0:2:14,709
and mortars, things like that, you get up
to about 12,000 units that can operate on


30
0:2:14,709 --> 0:2:19,819
the ground. And of course, their air force
is formidable. About 800 aircraft out there,


31
0:2:19,819 --> 0:2:24,87
including some 200 helicopters. This is largely
what they`ve used to have these strikes within


32
0:2:24,87 --> 0:2:25,58
Gaza.


33
0:2:25,58 --> 0:2:32,6
Now, if you look at Hamas, their forces are
much smaller in terms of their official forces,


34
0:2:32,6 --> 0:2:35,439
certainly, if you look at people who are really
in uniform, soldiers, police, whatever you


35
0:2:35,439 --> 0:2:40,47
want to call it -- about 12,500 -- and of
course they have nothing like the weapons


36
0:2:40,47 --> 0:2:46,989
that the Israelis have. However, Palestinian
militants do have lots and lots of rockets,


37
0:2:46,989 --> 0:2:51,409
and I want to bring in a model of one of them
here. This is a Kassam 2, you probably heard


38
0:2:51,409 --> 0:2:55,45
this a good bit. These rockets are popular
because they are cheap, they`re easy to make


39
0:2:55,45 --> 0:2:59,95
out of steel tubes. They only weigh 70 to
100 pounds, and they are fueled essentially


40
0:2:59,95 --> 0:3:4,269
by commercial-grade fertilizer, and they can
pack quite a punch. They`re not very accurate,


41
0:3:4,269 --> 0:3:7,34
but if you fire enough of them, they don`t
have to be accurate.


42
0:3:7,34 --> 0:3:13,51
If you go beyond this to some of their more
robust and better targeted rockets and missiles,


43
0:3:13,51 --> 0:3:18,65
then you also start talking about range. In
this conflict so far, we have reports of weapons


44
0:3:18,65 --> 0:3:24,65
fired from Gaza traveling as much as 50 miles
to hit Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. In fact, Israeli


45
0:3:24,65 --> 0:3:30,29
officials now believe as much as a fifth of
population of Israel is subject to these rocket


46
0:3:30,29 --> 0:3:33,819
attacks. That`s something they say they simply
will not tolerate anymore, and that`s why


47
0:3:33,819 --> 0:3:39,5
we keep hearing all this talk and speculation
about a possible ground invasion of Gaza.


48
0:3:39,5 --> 0:3:41,49
(END VIDEOTAPE)


49
0:3:41,49 --> 0:3:47,79
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Just the facts. Myanmar
is a country in Southeast Asia. It used to


50
0:3:47,79 --> 0:3:55,78
be known as Burma. The nation got its independence
from Great Britain in 1948. Starting in 1962,


51
0:3:55,78 --> 0:4:2,799
Myanmar was ruled by a military junta, a small
group that held all the power. Nearly 50 years


52
0:4:2,799 --> 0:4:9,31
later, in 2011, Myanmar established a civilian
government.


53
0:4:9,31 --> 0:4:16,38
LANCE: President Obama says the shift in Myanmar
toward a democratic government is a good step.


54
0:4:16,38 --> 0:4:20,17
He also says the country has a long way to
go, and he`s planning to deliver that message


55
0:4:20,17 --> 0:4:25,94
in person this week when he becomes the first
U.S. president to visit the nation. Myanmar


56
0:4:25,94 --> 0:4:30,24
is one of three countries that the president
is visiting on a trip to Southeast Asia. He


57
0:4:30,24 --> 0:4:35,57
will end up in Cambodia for the East Asia
summit, but his first stop was in Thailand.


58
0:4:35,57 --> 0:4:40,8
President Obama took part in an official welcoming
ceremony with the country`s prime minister.


59
0:4:40,8 --> 0:4:44,86
Later in the day, he was the guest at an official
dinner. The U.S. and Thailand have a relationship


60
0:4:44,86 --> 0:4:49,31
that goes back nearly 200 years. The president
brought that up during his visit, calling


61
0:4:49,31 --> 0:4:52,66
Thailand America`s oldest friend in Asia.


62
0:4:52,66 --> 0:5:1,4
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: See if you can ID me.
I am a microscopic agent that can cause infections.


63
0:5:1,4 --> 0:5:7,87
I was first identified in the late 1800s.
I can spread in animals or plants, but only


64
0:5:7,87 --> 0:5:16,57
inside their living cells. My name comes from
a Latin word that means slime or poison. I`m


65
0:5:16,57 --> 0:5:25,1
a virus, and different types of me cause colds
and the flu.


66
0:5:25,1 --> 0:5:31,6
LANCE: And those viruses are pretty common
around this time of year, and that`s because


67
0:5:31,6 --> 0:5:35,66
from October through May, it`s cold and flu
season. So instead of just running through


68
0:5:35,66 --> 0:5:39,44
some facts and advice, we thought that we`d
have a little bit of fun with this. So get


69
0:5:39,44 --> 0:5:43,38
ready to shout out some answers to our flu
and cold quiz.


70
0:5:43,38 --> 0:5:50,76
First, true or false? You get colds from being
cold. False. We covered this one in the ID


71
0:5:50,76 --> 0:5:55,7
me. Colds and flu are caused by viruses. They
pop up more during the winter because people


72
0:5:55,7 --> 0:6:0,24
stay inside more, and so that means germs
spread more easily.


73
0:6:0,24 --> 0:6:5,88
Next, true or false? You need to come in direct
contact with someone to catch the flu from


74
0:6:5,88 --> 0:6:12,19
them. That one is false too. You can be six
to 10 feet away from someone who`s sick and


75
0:6:12,19 --> 0:6:15,66
still catch their cold or flu.


76
0:6:15,66 --> 0:6:22,21
True of false? One of the best ways to avoid
getting sick is to wash your hands regularly.


77
0:6:22,21 --> 0:6:28,7
That one is totally true. Experts say washing
with soap and water will keep germs from spreading.


78
0:6:28,7 --> 0:6:34,5
True or false? If you get a flu shot, you
are guaranteed not to catch the flu that year.


79
0:6:34,5 --> 0:6:40,22
Oh, that one is false. Flu shots are not 100
percent effective, but getting one will significantly


80
0:6:40,22 --> 0:6:45,1
cut down your chances of getting sick, and
experts say if you do get sick, the symptoms


81
0:6:45,1 --> 0:6:46,99
probably won`t be as bad.


82
0:6:46,99 --> 0:6:52,39
OK, and the last one, true of false? If you
catch the flu, the best treatment is to get


83
0:6:52,39 --> 0:6:59,31
plenty of rest. That one is true. Doctors
may recommend medication sometimes, but for


84
0:6:59,31 --> 0:7:3,92
the most part, the best way to treat the flu
is with lots of rest and lots of fluids.


85
0:7:3,92 --> 0:7:9,0
S if you go out to the store this weekend
and you see a Twinkie on the shelves, you


86
0:7:9,0 --> 0:7:12,19
might want to remember what it looks like,
because there is a chance you won`t see it


87
0:7:12,19 --> 0:7:17,3
again any time soon. The company that makes
them, and that`s Hostess, is shutting down.


88
0:7:17,3 --> 0:7:22,66
It announced the decision last Friday. Closing
up shop means more than 18,000 employees will


89
0:7:22,66 --> 0:7:27,9
lose their jobs. A lot of those bakers have
been on strike. They were protesting against


90
0:7:27,9 --> 0:7:31,33
a new contract that would cut their pay and
benefits. Hostess says it cannot afford to


91
0:7:31,33 --> 0:7:33,88
stay open through the extended strike.


92
0:7:33,88 --> 0:7:38,46
With the company closing, the future of the
food it makes is up in the air. Alison Kosik


93
0:7:38,46 --> 0:7:42,82
looks at one of those items, evolved from
a snack into a part of American culture.


94
0:7:42,82 --> 0:7:43,34
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


95
0:7:43,34 --> 0:7:48,2
ALISON KOSIK, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Following
a nasty labor dispute and almost a year in


96
0:7:48,2 --> 0:7:53,75
bankruptcy, Hostess Brands is closing its
33 bakeries, more than 500 distribution centers,


97
0:7:53,75 --> 0:7:58,43
and selling off its assets, putting the future
of the 82-year-old Twinkie in question. It`s


98
0:7:58,43 --> 0:8:2,75
been a long road for the cream-filled pastry,
now part of the American lexicon.


99
0:8:2,75 --> 0:8:3,69
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It`s Twinkie the kid!


100
0:8:3,69 --> 0:8:5,46
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Wow!


101
0:8:5,46 --> 0:8:11,93
KOSIK: The Twinkie was born in 1930 in Illinois.
Inventor James Dewar was looking for a way


102
0:8:11,93 --> 0:8:17,17
to use the Continental Baking Company`s seasonal
strawberry shortcake pans year round. He came


103
0:8:17,17 --> 0:8:22,77
up with a yellow sponge cake filled with banana
cream, but during World War II, banana rationing


104
0:8:22,77 --> 0:8:27,55
forced the company to change to vanilla cream
filling. The replacement was so popular, it


105
0:8:27,55 --> 0:8:33,879
never changed back. Over the years, the Twinkie
became a part of American popular culture.


106
0:8:33,879 --> 0:8:38,61
In the 1950s the Howdy Doody show host Buffalo
Bob gave it an endorsement.


107
0:8:38,61 --> 0:8:43,31
BUFFALO BOB: Presto, and what do we have?
Hostess Twinkies.


108
0:8:43,31 --> 0:8:44,91
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Obsession.


109
0:8:44,91 --> 0:8:49,41
KOSIK: In the 1990s there was a presidential
endorsement as President Bill Clinton included


110
0:8:49,41 --> 0:8:54,22
a Twinkie in a millennium time capsule. And
in the Youtube age, we`ve seen the Twinkie


111
0:8:54,22 --> 0:8:58,56
put to the test for shelf life, toughness
and microwave ability.


112
0:8:58,56 --> 0:9:2,639
KOSIK: But now the Twinkie needs someone to
come to its rescue or we`ll have to say good-bye


113
0:9:2,639 --> 0:9:5,0
to the Twinkie for good.


114
0:9:5,0 --> 0:9:6,66
Alison Kosik, CNN, New York.


115
0:9:6,66 --> 0:9:7,389
(END VIDEOTAPE)


116
0:9:7,389 --> 0:9:11,379
LANCE: Before we go, we`re going to look at
a really unique bike, and this thing is so


117
0:9:11,379 --> 0:9:14,339
cool. So you`ve seen a two-wheeler, probably
had a three- wheeler when you were growing


118
0:9:14,339 --> 0:9:19,399
up, but this Georgia teenager came up with
a 2 by 4 wheeler. It`s a bike built entirely


119
0:9:19,399 --> 0:9:23,579
out of wood, and it might not be good for
all cyclists, but it could appeal to a splinter


120
0:9:23,579 --> 0:9:27,92
group. They might really pine for it. This
is the kind of thing you have to cedar to


121
0:9:27,92 --> 0:9:33,5
believe, but even then you might want to take
it out for a spin. But we`re guessing that


122
0:9:33,5 --> 0:9:38,36
if you could, you would. So the big question,
why did he pick this material for his bike?


123
0:9:38,36 --> 0:9:43,649
And the answer, he was board. Sometimes the
puns just really write themselves here, you


124
0:9:43,649 --> 0:9:43,959
guys.


125
0:9:43,959 --> 0:9:48,319
But we`ll be back with more of them tomorrow
too, so for CNN STUDENT NEWS, I`m Natisha


126
0:9:48,319 --> 0:11:48,319
Lance. Have a good one.
