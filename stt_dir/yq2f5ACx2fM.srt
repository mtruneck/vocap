0:0:31,398 --> 0:0:33,52
TERI DIMARINO: The competition
can involve everything from


4
0:0:33,52 --> 0:0:35,35
the sublime to the ridiculous.


5
0:0:35,35 --> 0:0:36,53
And it's fun.


6
0:0:36,53 --> 0:0:38,175
It is still a grooming
competition.


7
0:0:38,175 --> 0:0:39,49
This is what people forget.


8
0:0:39,49 --> 0:0:41,78
It's not just a dog-decorating
competition.


9
0:0:41,78 --> 0:0:44,815
There are criteria based
on the coloring of


10
0:0:44,815 --> 0:0:45,815
the dog, its grooming.


11
0:0:45,815 --> 0:0:47,18
There's technical
aspects of it.


12
0:0:47,18 --> 0:0:49,57
How is the scissoring,
the clipper work?


13
0:0:49,57 --> 0:0:50,77
Is it clean?


14
0:0:50,77 --> 0:0:52,6
Here there's no holds barred.


15
0:0:52,6 --> 0:0:56,16
Everything is pretty much legal
with the designs, the


16
0:0:56,16 --> 0:0:58,75
creativity, and our
presentations.


17
0:0:58,75 --> 0:1:0,0
It's a package.


18
0:1:0,0 --> 0:1:5,62



19
0:1:5,62 --> 0:1:6,895
ADRIENNE POPE: Well first
of all, you walk out


20
0:1:6,895 --> 0:1:7,71
with a dog like that.


21
0:1:7,71 --> 0:1:9,73
When I go to a gas station
on the way here,


22
0:1:9,73 --> 0:1:10,62
people bombard me.


23
0:1:10,62 --> 0:1:12,76
I mean, they're just
like, oh my gosh!


24
0:1:12,76 --> 0:1:13,87
Was he born like that?


25
0:1:13,87 --> 0:1:15,35
I mean, I've gotten
so many questions.


26
0:1:15,35 --> 0:1:17,98



27
0:1:17,98 --> 0:1:20,78
KAT OBSON: My dog's name is
Koby, and he is a puppy.


28
0:1:20,78 --> 0:1:23,5
And he is designed in a
Jurassic-Park theme.


29
0:1:23,5 --> 0:1:25,907
And the poodles have such great
hair for it because it


30
0:1:25,907 --> 0:1:26,992
just sticks straight out.


31
0:1:26,992 --> 0:1:28,8
So it's really easy to sculpt.


32
0:1:28,8 --> 0:1:30,1
And I enjoy it.


33
0:1:30,1 --> 0:1:31,3
It's fun.


34
0:1:31,3 --> 0:1:33,79
It's good time to spend
with your dog, good


35
0:1:33,79 --> 0:1:35,736
time to spend bonding.


36
0:1:35,736 --> 0:1:38,59
And he gets all this attention
after he's done.


37
0:1:38,59 --> 0:1:50,46



38
0:1:50,46 --> 0:1:51,6
TERI DIMARINO: OK.


39
0:1:51,6 --> 0:1:55,56
Our winner of the Groom Expo
2011 People's Choice Award is


40
0:1:55,56 --> 0:1:57,6
Jurassic Bark.

0:1:57,6 --> 0:2:10,26
