###33 BILL BRYANT: Well, the old adage that we go by is, if you
###36 have a chance to top off, top off.
###38 And sometimes just because you can make it 150 miles on a
###41 tank, you don't know if the gas station at the other end
###43 of that 100 miles is really going to be open or
###45 functioning, and we planned ahead for that.
###50 Buy gas off the locals.
###51 And I only see them every year or two or whatever, but
###56 they're pretty consistently there.
###58 It's probably the same guys-- probably has been forever.
###60 [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###61 
###76 KEEGAN SAUDER: At first when I actually heard that we had a
###79 guide, I was kind of like, oh really?
###81 We have a guide?
###83 I think it could be pretty easy, but it's actually been
###86 really good having those guys.
###87 Because they've done this before, and you
###90 might run out of gas.
###91 BILL BRYANT: I was trying to get it all from one guy.
###93 But there's two dudes that are splitting this territory, so
###96 he doesn't want to cock block the other dude.
###97 So we've made it more complicated.
###100 ARTO SAARI: Well, we might be shit out of luck around here.
###105 This might be the two only guys.
###108 I think we'd fucking be in some severe trouble or
###112 somewhere in the gutter if it wasn't for Bill.
###116 I can't wait for your interview.
###118 It's like, he's these fucking kooks, man.
###120 These fucking monkeys think they're riding bikes and shit.
###125 KYNAN TAIT: He seems like he has a pretty good tolerance.
###128 I know he gets fed up having to wait for everyone, because
###131 we do so much waiting at gas stations.
###135 BILL BRYANT: I'm just kind of driven.
###136 I want to get up early, I want to hit the road, I want to get
###138 my miles done.
###139 In case there's a problem, I want to be working on it in
###141 the daylight.
###141 And so guys would kind of do their own thing and some would
###144 want to go faster and some slower and that kind of thing
###147 and it complicates the movement.
###149 
###154 HIME HERBERT: Yeah, he doesn't like waiting.
###157 We did the other ride, he's be like OK, get your gas.
###159 OK, let's go.
###160 
###163 HEATH KIRCHART: I like riding by myself.
###165 I like riding a motorcycle by myself.
###167 I like being completely alone and doing whatever I want.
###170 So I like to break off and be on my own.
###173 
###176 KEEGAN SAUDER: He definitely has kind of the lone wolf kind
###182 of air about him.
###185 Just sitting off in the shade like, I've already got gas, I
###188 was here a half hour ago, I'm ready.
###191 He doesn't care if he rides 500 miles, I don't think.
###194 He would just do it.
###196 PATRICK O'DELL: Like honestly, if it was just me and Heath on
###199 this trip, or if it was just Heath, turns where we went
###203 into San Ignacio--
###204 that wouldn't happen.
###205 
###217 HEATH KIRCHART: I mean, it's gets from OK to epic as you
###221 slowly get down closer to the bottom.
###226 KEEGAN SAUDER: This is the closest thing to an oasis I
###230 think I've ever seen, except for pictures of them in
###233 "National Geographic." It only lasts for a few miles, and
###237 then it's gone.
###238 Pretty awesome little spot.
###240 
###243 BILL BRYANT: True Baja, to me, really starts in San Ignacio.
###247 It just feels like authentic Baja.
###249 There's handpainted signs and things that look exactly like
###253 they looked when I saw them 20 years ago.
###255 And they probably look exactly like they looked 50 years ago.
###286 KEEGAN SAUDER: At the end of September I just put two small
###290 fractures near the toes.
###292 Skating makes it sore, or doing too many doughnuts on
###296 the motorcycle.
###297 So the doctor said just keep trying to not do anything that
###301 makes it hurt and you'll get better.
###303 
###308 KEEGAN SAUDER: I'm sure I have at some point in person.
###311 
###314 Oh, wait, OK.
###315 We're going to go way back to 1994, when Foundation did a
###320 demo in my hometown in Nelson, BC.
###322 I saw him skate then.
###324 He was probably 15.
###327 He's sick.
###328 Sick Kirchart.
###329 
###342 Arto's actually kind a similar vibe to friends from Canada
###348 and Australia that I've been on motorcycle trips with.
###351 
###354 You know, that get in the water kind of attitude.
###357 Just go for it.
###358 
###365 Just trying to get as epic as possible at all times.
###369 
###387 HIME HERBERT: I don't think we've ever ruined a more
###390 ancient skate spot, which is kind of awesome.
###396 
###406 ARTO SAARI: That's the local church.
###409 Let's go have a look inside, see what they got.
###411 
###417 ARTO SAARI: Not so much.
###420 The ceilings looks pretty cool.
###422 Must have been so hard to build.
###424 
###439 HIME HERBERT: I had sex with a lot of hookers.
###442 ARTO SAARI: Go on my child.
###443 HIME HERBERT: And did tons of blow.
###446 ARTO SAARI: Oh, it's all right.
###447 Jesus forgives you--
###448 HIME HERBERT: Thank God.
###449 ARTO SAARI: --for such things.
###450 How much was the coke?
###452 HIME HERBERT: I forget.
###454 The hooker was expensive though.
###456 ARTO SAARI: You probably got ripped off.
###458 Just don't do it again.
###460 HIME HERBERT: All right.
###461 Hail Mary, full of grace?
###463 ARTO SAARI: Hail Mary.
###464 
###473 Jesus likes money.
###474 
###477 KYNAN TAIT: He's in every corner of this place.
###479 
###523 MALE SPEAKER: You see those kids dressed up?
###526 There's going to be a party up here in a couple hours and
###529 we'll be able to party with the locals.
###532 
###552 KYNAN TAIT: San Ignacio was the first
###554 legitimate camp spot.
###557 And we showed up and it was just this dirt--
###561 
###564 I don't know, just this dirt lot.
###567 
###569 ARTO SAARI: Kind of looks a little bit
###571 un-epic, if I must say.
###576 Make your bed.
###579 HIME HERBERT: This doesn't look like a campground.
###582 BILL BRYANT: Dude, there was a massive hurricane here in
###584 August, and all this has been flooded.
###586 You're welcome to explore.
###587 This is what there is.
###588 I mean, I went to the other campground that he had picked
###591 originally and there was no way you could get into it.
###593 It was just palm trees and sand and rocks and stuff.
###596 So this is kind of where we're at.
###598 
###603 HARVEY FOSTER: Are those vultures or just birds?
###605 
###618 MALE SPEAKER: Did you have any fun in town that night?
###621 KYNAN TAIT: Yeah, it was pretty fun.
###623 It was Halloween proper, I guess, and all the kids were
###629 out trick or treating.
###630 
###633 Man, that kid's cool.
###635 HARVEY FOSTER: He's a kiddie.
###638 A little kiddie.
###639 How about these guys?
###640 
###644 [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###645 
###671 HARVEY FOSTER: What?
###673 What'd she say?
###674 Do you understand?
###674 FEMALE SPEAKER: Huh?
###675 Huh?
###677 HARVEY FOSTER: Hola!
###678 
###680 Adios!
###680 FEMALE SPEAKER: Adios!
###682 HARVEY FOSTER: Time to party, man.
###684 How hard is it to party?
###687 KYNAN TAIT: It was kind of a weird
###690 scene in the town square.
###691 There was like all these old guys sitting in these line of
###695 chairs watching a boxing match on TV.
###699 HARVEY FOSTER: Oh, there's boxing right here.
###701 KYNAN TAIT: And 20 feet to the left of them were all of their
###706 kids beating the shit out of each other with
###709 boxing gloves on.
###711 [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###716 HARVEY FOSTER: Go, Carlos!
###717 
###724 HARVEY FOSTER: He's got pipes.
###726 Look at his muscles.
###727 HEATH KIRCHART: Like when I saw that, I was like oh, we
###729 need to get involved in this.
###731 We need to become a part of this.
###732 
###736 I haven't seen any young people this entire
###739 trip, look at this.
###740 
###742 Turns out you just got to box.
###745 I need boxing gloves.
###747 When I was there, I was like I want to be in this.
###751 Because I was like I want to box, but I don't want to be
###753 the guy that's like, I want to box.
###756 But they just kind of like put the gloves on me.
###759 I just don't want to fight that one guy.
###762 No Carlos!
###764 No!
###765 
###768 HARVEY FOSTER: Too late!
###769 Too late!
###769 Too late!
###770 Who am I getting?
###772 [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###773 
###777 HEATH KIRCHART: [INAUDIBLE], man.
###779 
###785 Is he making fun of me?
###787 
###810 You got me.
###811 
###814 MALE SPEAKER: What happened to your finger?
###815 HEATH KIRCHART: No, he hit me in the nose.
###817 
###822 HARVEY FOSTER: He's kicked the shit out of Carlos.
###824 Do you guys remember when he was telling me to
###826 fight the kid after?
###827 I was like, what?
###828 No, dude.
###829 I'll actually get beat up.
###831 There's going to be like all these kids beating us up.
###834 That was pretty fun.
###835 And we waited like two hours for our food.
###841 But that was all right, because we all got drunk.
###843 MALE SPEAKER: You held your own, man.
###845 You had him going.
###846 HEATH KIRCHART: I did not.
###846 I thought I'd get knocked out.
###847 MALE SPEAKER: You didn't get knocked down.
###848 You stumbled one time, that was it.
###850
