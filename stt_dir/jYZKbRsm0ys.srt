1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:10,25



2
0:0:10,25 --> 0:0:11,59
NECKFACE: Should I go away so
you can say some stuff?


3
0:0:11,59 --> 0:0:13,55
PATRICK: No, that's fine.


4
0:0:13,55 --> 0:0:14,4
NECKFACE: Hi.


5
0:0:14,4 --> 0:0:16,68
Welcome back to the Epicly
Later'd Show.


6
0:0:16,68 --> 0:0:20,39
This episode, our special guest
is Neckface, who is


7
0:0:20,39 --> 0:0:22,96
standing right next to
me with a skull.


8
0:0:22,96 --> 0:0:25,92
Does a lot of writing
on walls.


9
0:0:25,92 --> 0:0:27,45
What else do you do?


10
0:0:27,45 --> 0:0:28,7
NECKFACE: I skate.


11
0:0:28,7 --> 0:0:31,138



12
0:0:31,138 --> 0:0:33,72
[LAUGHING], I skate.


13
0:0:33,72 --> 0:0:35,1
I paint.


14
0:0:35,1 --> 0:0:38,1
I just do whatever makes
me happy, and makes


15
0:0:38,1 --> 0:0:40,94
other people bummed.


16
0:0:40,94 --> 0:0:42,72
Zero trans fat.


17
0:0:42,72 --> 0:0:44,13
PATRICK: Is it a bunny?


18
0:0:44,13 --> 0:0:47,17
NECKFACE: No, it's a bat.


19
0:0:47,17 --> 0:0:49,5
These are bat ears.


20
0:0:49,5 --> 0:0:50,67
PATRICK: Those look
like bunny ears.


21
0:0:50,67 --> 0:0:52,8
NECKFACE: No, it's
a bat, dude.


22
0:0:52,8 --> 0:0:55,12
So it's like I'm Batman, and
I'm hiding my identity.


23
0:0:55,12 --> 0:0:57,78



24
0:0:57,78 --> 0:1:0,77
If I have this on, they're like
oh, there's Neckface.


25
0:1:0,77 --> 0:1:4,79
When I take this off, it's like,
oh, some random dude.


26
0:1:4,79 --> 0:1:7,42
My real face is my mask.


27
0:1:7,42 --> 0:1:8,843
This is Neckface.


28
0:1:8,843 --> 0:1:10,292
My real face is my mask.


29
0:1:10,292 --> 0:1:14,64



30
0:1:14,64 --> 0:1:18,95
See all those people
on the train there,


31
0:1:18,95 --> 0:1:21,63
everyone on the train?


32
0:1:21,63 --> 0:1:24,49
They don't know who
you're filming.


33
0:1:24,49 --> 0:1:28,33
I pass by cops all the
time, every day.


34
0:1:28,33 --> 0:1:31,85
Every time I pass by them,
they have no idea.


35
0:1:31,85 --> 0:1:35,264
But if they knew, [LAUGHING].


36
0:1:35,264 --> 0:1:39,51



37
0:1:39,51 --> 0:1:42,6
So I'm riding on this
bridge, right?


38
0:1:42,6 --> 0:1:45,795
I'm just looking at the city
like everyone else does.


39
0:1:45,795 --> 0:1:50,26
But not everyone else
sees what I see.


40
0:1:50,26 --> 0:1:54,93
Buildings, buildings, buildings,
oh, two billboards.


41
0:1:54,93 --> 0:1:55,61
Right there.


42
0:1:55,61 --> 0:1:59,29
One of them was the one
for Neckface Begins.


43
0:1:59,29 --> 0:2:2,81
For me, I want to make
people laugh.


44
0:2:2,81 --> 0:2:7,83
I want the person who is just
bummed out, like, man, fuck


45
0:2:7,83 --> 0:2:11,14
that girl, like, fuck this
place, like, I'm never going


46
0:2:11,14 --> 0:2:12,56
there again.


47
0:2:12,56 --> 0:2:14,8
Just so bummed, the person's
so bummed out, right?


48
0:2:14,8 --> 0:2:19,35
And then he sees my thing on
the streets, and it says


49
0:2:19,35 --> 0:2:21,19
Neckface, beat your kids.


50
0:2:21,19 --> 0:2:24,38
And if I bring a smile to that
guy who's been so bummed out


51
0:2:24,38 --> 0:2:26,94
the whole day, or a whole
week, then that's


52
0:2:26,94 --> 0:2:30,76
like, I feel psyched.


53
0:2:30,76 --> 0:2:33,43
It's just like growing up, just
being a bad kid, doorbell


54
0:2:33,43 --> 0:2:37,17
ditching and kicking other
people's trash cans over, this


55
0:2:37,17 --> 0:2:42,16
is what I was meant
to be, I think.


56
0:2:42,16 --> 0:2:46,66
King Diamond is like my
dad, my father figure.


57
0:2:46,66 --> 0:2:48,38
He's rad, man.


58
0:2:48,38 --> 0:2:52,88
King Diamond is like when
you're trying all these


59
0:2:52,88 --> 0:2:55,95
flavors of Gatorade, and you're
over all these Gatorade


60
0:2:55,95 --> 0:2:59,755
flavors, and then you finally
find the fucking Riptide Rush.


61
0:2:59,755 --> 0:3:0,57
And you're like, what?


62
0:3:0,57 --> 0:3:2,85
This Gatorade's fucking sick.


63
0:3:2,85 --> 0:3:5,0
That's who King Diamond is.


64
0:3:5,0 --> 0:3:6,35
To me that's who he is.


65
0:3:6,35 --> 0:3:12,48
I was digging through all these
little whatever things.


66
0:3:12,48 --> 0:3:16,72
And I found King Diamond, and
that's the guy for me.


67
0:3:16,72 --> 0:3:20,255
The dream that I just had of
me turning into a bat and


68
0:3:20,255 --> 0:3:22,22
flying away makes sense.


69
0:3:22,22 --> 0:3:23,74
PATRICK: Is this your
inspiration board?


70
0:3:23,74 --> 0:3:25,74
NECKFACE: It is my inspiration
board.


71
0:3:25,74 --> 0:3:27,45
And I need to change it.


72
0:3:27,45 --> 0:3:30,35
This is a squishy face.


73
0:3:30,35 --> 0:3:30,98
It's a doll.


74
0:3:30,98 --> 0:3:32,16
Somebody made that.


75
0:3:32,16 --> 0:3:35,5
It's Eddie, from Iron Maiden,
who's actually


76
0:3:35,5 --> 0:3:36,4
coming out of a shirt.


77
0:3:36,4 --> 0:3:37,37
That's not a graphic.


78
0:3:37,37 --> 0:3:40,38
That's him coming
out of a shirt.


79
0:3:40,38 --> 0:3:44,34
This girl gave me a whole bag
of stuff for my birthday, a


80
0:3:44,34 --> 0:3:46,11
bunch of random stuff
from her house.


81
0:3:46,11 --> 0:3:48,18
And this guy was in there.


82
0:3:48,18 --> 0:3:50,55
That's where that
guy came from.


83
0:3:50,55 --> 0:3:52,63
My parents didn't care
about me watching


84
0:3:52,63 --> 0:3:54,96
rated R movie, or something.


85
0:3:54,96 --> 0:3:57,14
So I was watching all this
crazy shit, like Freddy


86
0:3:57,14 --> 0:4:1,69
Krueger and Nightmare on Elm
Street and Jason, and all that


87
0:4:1,69 --> 0:4:3,45
stuff at a young age.


88
0:4:3,45 --> 0:4:8,51
And it's just really like
a comic relief.


89
0:4:8,51 --> 0:4:12,29
[EVIL CACKLE]


90
0:4:12,29 --> 0:4:15,93
NECKFACE: If I see a old lady
fall down on the street, it


91
0:4:15,93 --> 0:4:18,29
may not be violent, but she
fell down on the street.


92
0:4:18,29 --> 0:4:20,47
Of course I'm going to laugh.


93
0:4:20,47 --> 0:4:23,9
Oh yeah, this is a new style,
using watercolors.


94
0:4:23,9 --> 0:4:27,56
Trying to take the beautiful
water colors, that everyone--


95
0:4:27,56 --> 0:4:30,74
oh, they're so pretty,
watercolors,


96
0:4:30,74 --> 0:4:32,32
paint a rain forest.


97
0:4:32,32 --> 0:4:35,36
And then I get the watercolors,
and then I just


98
0:4:35,36 --> 0:4:37,55
fuck it up.


99
0:4:37,55 --> 0:4:42,39
I just mess it up and make
this fucked up guy here,


100
0:4:42,39 --> 0:4:49,11
taking your water color and
creating a mess out of it.


101
0:4:49,11 --> 0:4:50,87
PATRICK: You went to art
school for a while.


102
0:4:50,87 --> 0:4:52,8
NECKFACE: Yeah, I went to art
school for two years and


103
0:4:52,8 --> 0:4:54,37
realized that it sucked dick.


104
0:4:54,37 --> 0:4:55,62
So I dropped out.


105
0:4:55,62 --> 0:4:58,63



106
0:4:58,63 --> 0:4:59,63
PATRICK: Those are
the originals?


107
0:4:59,63 --> 0:5:2,76
NECKFACE: Yeah, these
are the originals.


108
0:5:2,76 --> 0:5:4,95
I don't know what the
fuck that is.


109
0:5:4,95 --> 0:5:8,3



110
0:5:8,3 --> 0:5:10,71
I think that might be
on Terry's board.


111
0:5:10,71 --> 0:5:15,2
Braden has this tattooed
on his arm, that guy.


112
0:5:15,2 --> 0:5:18,7
This one is on Terry Kennedy's
board, too.


113
0:5:18,7 --> 0:5:20,59
Devil slam dunking, nobody knows
that the devil plays


114
0:5:20,59 --> 0:5:22,31
basketball.


115
0:5:22,31 --> 0:5:24,88
I'm doing the same thing I've
been doing for years.


116
0:5:24,88 --> 0:5:27,53
And it's like, finally people
are like, oh, his


117
0:5:27,53 --> 0:5:29,3
art's pretty cool.


118
0:5:29,3 --> 0:5:30,43
Maybe we'll give him a show.


119
0:5:30,43 --> 0:5:33,34
But it's like the whole
world against me.


120
0:5:33,34 --> 0:5:36,97
Like, fuck that guy, he sucks.


121
0:5:36,97 --> 0:5:38,77
I'm not going to be like,
OK, everyone hates me.


122
0:5:38,77 --> 0:5:40,23
I'm going to stop.


123
0:5:40,23 --> 0:5:40,56
No.


124
0:5:40,56 --> 0:5:41,73
No fucking way.


125
0:5:41,73 --> 0:5:43,19
I'm going to still be
out there, even if


126
0:5:43,19 --> 0:5:45,27
you hate me or not.


127
0:5:45,27 --> 0:5:47,1
PATRICK: How did you learn
how to papier-mache?


128
0:5:47,1 --> 0:5:48,42
NECKFACE: Not even elementary
school.


129
0:5:48,42 --> 0:5:51,75
Like where you have to make the
balloon, and then you put


130
0:5:51,75 --> 0:5:53,64
the papier-mache over it.


131
0:5:53,64 --> 0:5:56,43
And then you pop the balloon,
and the thing still stays,


132
0:5:56,43 --> 0:5:57,68
because it's dry?


133
0:5:57,68 --> 0:5:59,9



134
0:5:59,9 --> 0:6:0,83
Like that.


135
0:6:0,83 --> 0:6:4,105
I think I learned more in school
in the early years than


136
0:6:4,105 --> 0:6:4,96
in the later years.


137
0:6:4,96 --> 0:6:6,52
Because in the later years,
I didn't give


138
0:6:6,52 --> 0:6:7,77
a fuck about school.


139
0:6:7,77 --> 0:6:10,9



140
0:6:10,9 --> 0:6:14,58
So I think if you're a teacher,
you should teach the


141
0:6:14,58 --> 0:6:17,65
kid as much as you can in the
beginning years of school,


142
0:6:17,65 --> 0:6:18,79
than towards the
end of school.


143
0:6:18,79 --> 0:6:21,93
Because the end school sucks
when you start figuring out,


144
0:6:21,93 --> 0:6:22,55
fuck school.


145
0:6:22,55 --> 0:6:23,49
I like skateboarding.


146
0:6:23,49 --> 0:6:27,26
I'm not going to go
to school no more.


147
0:6:27,26 --> 0:6:28,51
Thar's what I think.


148
0:6:28,51 --> 0:8:28,51
