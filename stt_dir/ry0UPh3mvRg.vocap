###18 HAYDEN GILLIM: We've had this track for four or five years
###22 and we've been riding on it every day.
###25 
###30 FRANKIE GILLIM: The good thing is, now they're all old enough
###33 that they can look over the littler kids.
###36 So I don't have to sit up here and babysit.
###37 
###46 They crashed a lot.
###47 Now they crash and it's all funny.
###50 Back then they crashed and it'd be
###51 like oh, I hurt myself.
###52 
###56 My granddad owned this 28 acres here.
###58 That used to be his house down there, his barn, raised
###61 cattle, worked in tobacco.
###63 KERRI GILLIM: They started racing when they were about
###65 six and eight and my family all had raced.
###67 So I raced when I was young, my uncle's family races, my
###70 dad raced, so we just always have been around it.
###73 
###78 I just want him to have fun.
###79 I try not to think about the whole if he's going
###82 to make it or not.
###84 Because life's too short.
###85 I want him to experience it, and I went him to enjoy his
###88 friends and the whole entire thing.
###91 HAYDEN GILLIM: I crashed at Indy--
###95 it's pretty beat up.
###98 And I got all the trophies from last year that I got, and
###106 the Rookie's Cup.
###107 Canteen that my grandpa gave me that he had
###111 in the Vietnam War.
###113 
###115 And then this is a plate that was in my
###120 collarbone last year.
###122 Right after I broke my
###123 collarbone, I won that weekend.
###126 So it was a good and bad weekend.
###127 
###130 And that t-shirt was made right after my
###136 little brother died.
###138 It's a picture of three of us on the podium at the Flat
###142 Track Nationals.
###144 Picture of him holding his Youth Dirt
###147 Tracker of the Year trophy.
###148 There's a picture of him and then I'm right there, he's
###151 beating me.
###154 I had to stop wearing it, couldn't put
###156 it through the washer.
###157 
###164 KERRI GILLIM: He was the clown, the one that scared
###167 everybody, the one that kept us all laughing.
###170 He was almost 11--
###171 May 5, 2007, he died.
###175 And it was just really a freak accident.
###177 I wasn't there, his dad and Frankie Lee
###179 and Hayden were there.
###181 And he just got into some kind of wobble that just took him
###184 up into a wall and hit the wall.
###186 Just too much force for his body to take, and he died
###189 about 15-20 minutes after he hit.
###192 DANNY WALKER: Hayden was one of the first guys there, and
###195 he knew right away that it was really, really bad.
###200 It's still something they struggle with constantly.
###203 KERRI GILLIM: Two weekends later, he actually went to a
###206 race and I wasn't crazy about it.
###208 Then when I was watching all of them, the only time at that
###211 point through that whole year it seemed like that's where
###214 they were the happiest.
###215 So I was like I can't make them stop.
###217 Five laps and you're coming in.
###218 MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE] doing a five lap race.
###220 KERRI GILLIM: Five lap race and done.
###222 
###227 The more kids you have and the more people you have at your
###229 house, the more likely they'll stay at the house and then you
###232 know what's going on.
###234 
###258 HAYDEN GILLIM: Owensboro has a lot of kids that race.
###262 Everybody always comes over to our house, just because we
###264 have a track and our parents don't really care about how
###267 dirty the house gets.
###268 
###272 Barbecue here's amazing.
###275 This is Kentucky.
###277 You don't find bad barbecue in Kentucky.
###279 
###300 KERRI GILLIM: Once Ethan died, all of his friends at first,
###303 the first few months, stopped coming over because I don't
###306 think they knew where their place was.
###308 And then as we would say you could come over, come over.
###311 And then they came over and would realize it's not creepy,
###315 it's OK to talk about him.
###316 
###320 MALE SPEAKER: Oh, Hayden.
###321 I'll see if you can spell a three-letter word, like sweet.
###327 But it's harder if they weren't here.
###329 Then it would be lonely and Ethan
###331 wouldn't have liked that.
###333 
###347 FRANKIE LEE GILLIM: Me and Hayden, we're real
###349 competitive.
###349 We road race, we don't really race each other.
###352 But flat track, we're in the same classes and stuff.
###356 I get more mad if he beats me than anybody else.
###359 Because it's my brother and we'd be riding home together
###361 and if I say something wrong, he'll be like well, sh, be
###364 quiet, I beat you today and it makes us all mad and stuff.
###367 Because we ride here together, we can push
###370 each other to go faster.
###371 
###380 HAYDEN GILLIM: During the summers, it's really hard to
###383 get yourself motivated to work out because of the heat.
###385 
###388 The average is 90 degrees, and then the
###390 humidity here is horrible.
###393 It just makes you have to push that much harder with how the
###396 landscape is here.
###398 
###417 FRANKIE GILLIM: I don't think any of this year he's actually
###420 been mentally prepared.
###422 It's kind of thrown a curve ball to me to try to figure
###424 out what to say to him.
###426 Try to help improve or try to help him realize that it's
###430 just a learning process and this is
###431 something you have to overcome.
###432 KERRI GILLIM: The first year I think that they worried about
###436 me and Frankie more on how we were taking it, how we were
###439 living, how we were going to survive.
###441 But the second year, I've always heard it's worse on the
###444 kids and it is.
###445 I think this second year's been really hard on them.
###447 DANNY WALKER: I'll never, ever, ever,
###449 get over losing him.
###453 It's weird, it's just such a strong spirit--
###457 you don't come across those that often.
###458 And the 10-year-old that's made such a difference in my
###461 life on how I talk to people and treat people.
###465 It's really a tough thing for the Gillim family, and
###469 everybody that was there.
###470 It's a tough thing to go OK, we're sending him back out.
###474 HAYDEN GILLIM: I'm not scared to die.
###476 As long as I'm going to heaven, I'll just embrace it
###482 and I'll go up there and hang out with my little brother and
###487 all the friends that have died racing.
###492 I'll just go up there and hang out with them, race some
###494 motorcycles.
###495
