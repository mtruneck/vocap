###12 NARRATOR: It's been a bloody month in Afghanistan, and
###14 there was more bad news as the Ministry of Defence announced
###17 the deaths of four more British soldiers.
###20 18 British soldiers' lives have been taken this month,
###23 bringing the total to 307.
###26 The news comes on the day that three more troops were
###28 repatriated to the town of Wootton Bassett.
###31 The announcement of yet more deaths has caused the local
###34 population to question how many more people will have to
###37 sacrifice their lives before the conflict ends.
###40 
###53 LAWRENCE BEDFORD: You're now in Paghman village.
###57 Beyond Paghman village, you've got the patrol base Mektila,
###60 where the company's operating from.
###62 They've got a platoon forward in Paghman which has taken
###65 over the ANP station.
###66 And there's now going to be a shura, which is going to take
###69 place at about 09:00, about 30 minutes time, where the OC
###73 will come down, have a meeting with the local elder here,
###77 just to see how he can improve the situation
###79 for the local nationals.
###80 
###87 NICK COPPERWAITE: Shakar does not have enough soldiers to
###89 protect the village.
###90 So if we work with Shakar, I will put soldiers in the
###93 village because they will give you greater protection.
###96 When they're no longer required, we will move back
###99 across to our base, and leave Shakar here.
###102 But we will do that in discussion between the Malik,
###105 Shakar, and myself.
###107 [MURMURING]
###109 MALE SPEAKER 1: Oh, that's good battlefield-brewed.
###111 You've got to have some.
###113 
###116 [EXPLOSIONS]
###121 MALE SPEAKER 2: [INAUDIBLE], is that mortars?
###123 [EXPLOSIONS AND GUNFIRE]
###125 MALE SPEAKER 3: Hey.
###126 MALE SPEAKER 4: It looks like he's got
###127 something under there.
###128 MALE SPEAKER 4: Lift up.
###131 [INAUDIBLE], you stay there.
###134 [SHOUTING AND GUNFIRE]
###137 [EXPLOSION]
###139 [CRYING AND SCREAMING]
###145 MALE SPEAKER 3: --at one, nine, nine, niner, over.
###147 MALE SPEAKER 4: Can you see through both eyes, mate?
###149 MALE SPEAKER 5: We're looking for an [INAUDIBLE], and it's
###151 going to be coming in soon.
###152 Coming
###153 FEMALE SPEAKER 1: [CRYING]
###155 MALE SPEAKER 6: Where's the medic?
###157 FEMALE SPEAKER 1: [CRYING]
###158 FEMALE SPEAKER 2: Basically, we had a local woman come in
###161 with her child and say, help my child, help my child.
###164 She was alive when she came in.
###167 She was obviously upset.
###168 FEMALE SPEAKER 1: [CRYING]
###177 FEMALE SPEAKER 2: Unfortunately, her wounds were
###179 very great.
###179 And there was nothing I could do as a class 2 medic.
###181 So I said to the woman, I did all I could do.
###183 I'm sorry, but your child's dead.
###190 There's not much we could've done.
###194 MALE SPEAKER 7: You're a child killer.
###195 FEMALE SPEAKER 2: Cheers.
###196 MALE SPEAKER 7: I'm joking, I'm joking.
###197 
###207 WILL HUNT: We're in a place called Stanford
###211 Training Area, STANTA.
###213 We're just heading up to, basically, where B-company's
###216 location is, which is called Fort Mektila.
###220 Because they've changed this area quite recently because of
###224 the way that we've altered our training.
###225 STANTA always used to be where it was set up for Northern
###228 Ireland training.
###229 So there were a lot of mock Northern Ireland-type
###233 buildings and farms.
###234 Over recent years, they've changed it to simulate
###238 Afghanistan.
###239 And actually, this is the first time I've been here
###240 since that change has happened.
###242 That's out in the training area, but as we've come out of
###244 the camp, we overshot the turning.
###246 So we're just going to turn 'round and go back.
###249 Might be in that one, actually, there, right.
###252 Have we gone past Hobson Farm yet?
###253 
###264 [INAUDIBLE] ranges on [INAUDIBLE].
###265 
###295 ADAM PROUD: We'll be extracted from here to--
###299 well, we're going to do a bit of an arc towards the ward,
###301 and then back to Mektila.
###302 And we'll also take the two dogs.
###305 
###311 JASMINE BARON: You could walk out in the street tomorrow and
###313 get hit by a bus and die.
###314 You could die doing anything, really.
###316 I mean, there's much more dangerous
###317 jobs, even, than ours.
###319 I get all the time, I get, oh look at the little girl with
###321 the little dog.
###322 [LAUGH]
###323 Just tell them to stick on the suit and start running.
###325 And they start shutting up a bit.
###326 MONIQUE REYNOLDS: But they father us quite a lot as well.
###329 [INAUDIBLE]
###329 JASMINE BARON: You get looked after, make sure you're OK and
###331 all the rest of it.
###332 And you end up going, yeah, well, I am in the army.
###335 [LAUGHTER]
###336 MONIQUE REYNOLDS: Mother, leave me alone.
###337 JASMINE BARON: You sometimes do have to remind some of them
###339 that you've got the same training as them.
###340 We do all the same stuff.
###342 INTERVIEWER: So you're like lethal weapons?
###344 MONIQUE REYNOLDS: No, I wouldn't go that far.
###347 Maybe our dogs, but not us.
###349 INTERVIEWER: All right.
###350 
###357 [EXPLOSIONS]
###362 MALE SPEAKER 8: [INAUDIBLE], body on one.
###364 All right?
###364 You're the fucking sergeant in here.
###366 All right, that's what should happen.
###368 Fucking take responsibility.
###370 Everyone here should be on channel 9, so they can say to
###373 me, engineer 10, no casualties.
###375 All right?
###376 I expect that to fucking happen.
###379 MALE SPEAKER 9: Just give zero radio a check,
###380 mate, before we disappear.
###382 
###392 [EXPLOSION]
###395 [SHOUTS AND EXPLOSIONS]
###414 [TROOP CONVERSATIONS]
###424 MALE SPEAKER 10: I'll cover these doors, mate.
###426 MALE SPEAKER 11: All right, keep your fucking eyes open.
###428 [SHOUTING]
###430 
###434 [RADIO CHATTER]
###440 MALE SPEAKER 12: [INAUDIBLE] shoot.
###441 MALE SPEAKER 13: That's fucking definitely them, but
###442 you can't see weapons on them now.
###444 MALE SPEAKER 12: Fucking yeah, they're
###444 fucking fair game, then.
###447 MALE SPEAKER 14: See if we can detain them and
###448 bring them in here.
###449 Preferably take them alive.
###451 If they're fighting--
###452 kill them, OK?
###453 [INAUDIBLE] rules of engagement.
###454 
###457 GLEN GARDENER: Get out and in as fast as you can.
###458 We need to speed it up here.
###460 
###466 Keep your eyes out to the northwest.
###468 They were walking from east to west.
###471 
###479 MALE SPEAKER 15: We were in Kosovo, and we went out to
###481 deal with this fucking dead body with the RMPs.
###483 This dead body had been probably
###484 for a couple of weeks.
###485 It was stinking.
###486 Bits kept falling off him because he was that fucking
###488 decomposed.
###488 It was unreal.
###489 He didn't even have a watch to take home.
###492 [LAUGH]
###498 And this other geezer, we had to snap his neck to put him in
###500 his coffin.
###502 Fucking, that was [INAUDIBLE].
###503 MALE SPEAKER 16: He wasn't even dead.
###505 [LAUGHTER]
###508 MALE SPEAKER 15: Yeah, [INAUDIBLE] fucking moaning
###510 like a bitch.
###511 GLEN GARDENER: Mopping up other people.
###512 [INAUDIBLE]
###514 Sarcasm-- the worst form of wit.
###516 I fucking thrive on it.
###518 MALE SPEAKER 15: Suicide bombers, all right mate, don't
###519 lose your head.
###520 Everything's all right.
###522 Fucking brilliant.
###523 What do you do if you find an epileptic in the bath?
###526 GLEN GARDENER: Put your washing in.
###527 MALE SPEAKER 15: Put your washing in.
###528 [LAUGH]
###529 GLEN GARDENER: [INAUDIBLE]
###530 swimming pool.
###532 Maybe we passed [INAUDIBLE].
###533 [LAUGHTER]
###536 MALE SPEAKER 15: What's black and orange, and
###538 looks good on a Muslim?
###539 A Bengal Tiger.
###540 [LAUGHTER]
###543 GLEN GARDENER: Why [INAUDIBLE], sir?
###545 because he's a cunt.
###547 MALE SPEAKER 15: Because he's a cunt.
###548 
###569 [EXPLOSIONS AND GUNFIRE]
###595 
###604 JOHN DENNIS: This is the Afghan village which was built
###606 about 18 months ago, specifically designed for
###608 training in Afghanistan.
###609 And this is just replicates one of the generic bazaars
###612 that we find in Afghanistan and
###613 throughout the Helmand area.
###615 MALE SPEAKER 16: [SPEAKING PASHTO]
###618 JOHN DENNIS: Just to add more realism, these are people from
###620 Afghanistan who've lived in the country for quite a while.
###623 MALE SPEAKER 16: [SPEAKING PASHTO]
###624 FEMALE SPEAKER 3: [SPEAKING PASHTO]
###627 JOHN DENNIS: I came in here about a year ago before I
###629 deployed to Afghanistan.
###630 And it just gives that touch of realism before you deploy
###633 to theater.
###634 MALE SPEAKER 17: [SPEAKING PASHTO]
###639 MALE SPEAKER 18: Don't let anyone near you.
###642 [MARKETPLACE CONVERSATION]
###654 [EXPLOSION]
###656 [SCREAMING AND CRYING]
###689 GLEN GARDENER: [INAUDIBLE]
###689 your fucking [INAUDIBLE].
###691 
###696 That casualty is coming in.
###698 Why would you take three casualties [INAUDIBLE]
###701 he's coming back.
###702 Put him there.
###704 Put him there.
###705 [INAUDIBLE].
###707 If people stop fucking [INAUDIBLE]
###710 things will move a lot smoother and a lot faster.
###713 MALE SPEAKER 19: Tourniquet applied, morphine given, all
###716 the vital signs are checked.
###718 [INAUDIBLE]
###719 It's clear, it's been tied.
###722 His pulse rate is high.
###724 
###745 RYAN WHITFIELD: [INAUDIBLE].
###747 Apparently, if you use the patches, they do work.
###750 INTERVIEWER: The patches work?
###750 RYAN WHITFIELD: Yeah, stick them over your eyes and
###752 camouflage your face.
###753 [DRUM FILL]
###756 [INAUDIBLE]
###757 DAVID GOOD: Hello, I'm David.
###758 I work for a company called Amputees in Action.
###760 And this is what I do for a living, is play casualties in
###764 [INAUDIBLE] work, really.
###765 RYAN WHITFIELD: And my name is Ryan.
###767 This is my first job as an OPTAG, a week away.
###771 DAVID GOOD: Well, this scenario--
###772 [INAUDIBLE] is the suicide bomber.
###774 So we were holding our little jobs
###776 RYAN WHITFIELD: It's just based around roleplaying.
###778 DAVID GOOD: And roleplay.
###779 So as soon as the bang goes off, then we'll come out
###781 covered in blood.
###782 And sort of--
###783 RYAN WHITFIELD: The blood bags are ready to explode.
###786 DAVID GOOD: [INAUDIBLE]
###789 RYAN WHITFIELD: It's basically a sock that goes out of our
###791 stump covered with cosmetics.
###793 DAVID GOOD: And we're always researching various injuries
###795 and things and trying to get it more and more realistic.
###799 RYAN WHITFIELD: This is quite a split, but it's not real.
###802 INTERVIEWER: Yeah, that's rough.
###803 RYAN WHITFIELD: Cut myself shaving.
###804 INTERVIEWER: Yeah, [LAUGH].
###805 DAVID GOOD: These are fairly basic ones, really, but later
###809 on, we'll be doing abdominals and chest injuries and things
###812 like that as well.
###813 RYAN WHITFIELD: Yeah, this is probably one of the best jobs
###815 I've ever had in my life.
###816 I've done sales work before, as an estate agent in a fairly
###820 fake environment.
###820 And this job allows me to use my disability to an advantage.
###824 And I also think, long term, this could be saving lives and
###827 helping out the forces.
###829 I'm a patriotic man, and it's nice to know that I can have
###832 some effect.
###833 
###860 BRENT THOM: I think this is the Mark VI helmet.
###864 It's the one you use on tour.
###865 I think we're getting a new one.
###866 I think we're going to something like the Americans
###868 use with the--
###870 it comes down further, beyond the neck.
###872 This is just like basic issue plates.
###876 Basically that, both sides.
###879 These'll stop 7.62.
###883 Difference with us and the Americans is, we use a
###884 smaller-caliber round.
###886 Because we're--
###888 it's just to injure.
###890 I'm not sure why we'd want to just injure
###892 someone shooting at you.
###893 But that's the scope of it.
###895 INTERVIEWER: So the enemy's weapons are trying to kill,
###898 but yours are only trying to injure.
###899 BRENT THOM: Yeah, they use a bigger caliber bullet.
###903 INTERVIEWER: How do you feel about that?
###905 BRENT THOM: Well, I don't know, really.
###908 It doesn't seem fair, does it, to be honest?
###912 If I could get away with injuring someone and not
###915 killing them, then I suppose that'd probably be better.
###918 so--
###920 RICHARD ROBINSON: This is the SAE [INAUDIBLE]
###922 582.
###923 It outshoots most of the weapons of its kind.
###926 
###930 INTERVIEWER: Have you been to Afghanistan?
###931 RICHARD ROBINSON: Yeah, I went last time, yeah.
###932 INTERVIEWER: How was it?
###933 RICHARD ROBINSON: Yeah, it was all right.
###936 INTERVIEWER: You didn't love it, didn't hate it?
###938 RICHARD ROBINSON: No.
###938 Didn't really like it too much either.
###941 Just, I don't know, something about it.
###942 It's just not a place you want to be-- getting shot at,
###944 everything like that.
###947 It's just not a nice place.
###948 
###953 [EXPLOSION]
###957 [GUNFIRE AND SHOUTING]
###970 BALL BAG: I've always wanted to join the army.
###972 I've got one uncle who's in the army.
###974 But that wasn't why.
###976 I've just always wanted to.
###979 Little boys and guns, I suppose.
###981 This'll be my first tour.
###983 I've wanted to do it because it is what you join up for, no
###986 matter what anyone says.
###987 It is the main part of the job.
###989 
###992 It's exciting, but it's scary as well.
###995 We'll see.
###996 Hear about blokes don't come back, and about mates who've
###999 been injured, and stuff like that.
###1001 
###1006 RICHARD DARE: This is me in Afghan.
###1008 This is about four minutes before I got hit.
###1010 INTERVIEWER: Really?
###1010 RICHARD DARE: Yeah.
###1011 And this is me after I got hit, about five minutes.
###1015 After [INAUDIBLE]
###1016 paralyzation and all that.
###1018 And then there's me--
###1020 and obviously I wasn't in no pain.
###1021 INTERVIEWER: Were you thinking, why are these
###1023 fuckers taking photographs of me?
###1025 RICHARD DARE: No, I gave my mate the camera.
###1026 I said do it.
###1028 I tried writing it down in my notebook
###1030 because I couldn't speak.
###1031 And I said, look, once in a lifetime picture.
###1033 I mean, just give me the camera.
###1036 But I wasn't in no pain, so I had no problems really.
###1040 [INAUDIBLE]
###1040 I don't get to wear.
###1044 I [INAUDIBLE].
###1047 The last time I wore it was a photoshoot.
###1051 We got woke up, like we did every
###1053 morning about half eight.
###1055 The Taliban had started chucking mortars at us.
###1059 We didn't wait to get [INAUDIBLE]
###1063 and then get out on the mortars and start retaliating.
###1066 It finished.
###1067 About five minutes went by.
###1069 Everyone stood down, so I took my body armor off, took my
###1072 helmet off.
###1073 And [INAUDIBLE]
###1074 the translator said that [INAUDIBLE].
###1077 And then within two seconds of me going like that--
###1079 I didn't even get my hand off the helmet, I got
###1081 blown to the side.
###1082 It landed about that far and [INAUDIBLE].
###1086 Looking around, I couldn't see no blood or
###1088 nothing, all right?
###1088 And then suddenly, I saw a gushing of blood just flow
###1093 down my head, hitting the floor and [INAUDIBLE]
###1094 roll down me.
###1095 I couldn't speak, couldn't move,
###1096 couldn't do nothing, really.
###1098 I was [INAUDIBLE]
###1100 first of all.
###1101 But as I got off the Chinook going to the ambulance, I was
###1104 just walking and suddenly just lost the use of my legs.
###1106 They said it was adrenaline that kept me going.
###1110 I had two shrapnels go through here.
###1112 I don't know if you can see the scar there.
###1115 [INAUDIBLE]
###1117 It cut the artery.
###1119 That's where all the blood came from.
###1120 I didn't know the extent of that until a few months later.
###1124 Because the blast was so close, it shook the brain side
###1129 to side, and it killed all the brain cells around the
###1131 outside, which give me signal problems.
###1135 So that's why I couldn't use certain muscles, and it was
###1138 tough to start walking.
###1139 Couldn't lift my arm up.
###1140 Couldn't speak properly.
###1141 Couldn't use my tongue.
###1143 [SLURRED AND CHOPPY SPEECH]
###1150 RICHARD DARE: Because then, I [INAUDIBLE].
###1154 Name and number.
###1158 That's it.
###1159 I couldn't [INAUDIBLE].
###1160 
###1163 They told me I probably wouldn't walk.
###1165 They told me I probably wouldn't do nothing.
###1168 But I managed to get--
###1169 INTERVIEWER: How old were you when they told you that?
###1173 RICHARD DARE: 22.
###1174 I mean it was only 5 days after my birthday.
###1176 So yeah, 22.
###1198 MARION YOUNG: RAF Lyneham is only a town away from us.
###1202 What happens is, the bodies get
###1203 repatriated to RAF Lyneham.
###1206 We're the first town on the way to Oxford.
###1209 So the repat bodies come through Wootton Bassett.
###1212 And then people line the streets to pay their respects
###1216 on the day.
###1217 Well, I've got three grown-up sons and none of them in the
###1221 armed forces.
###1222 I know it sounds a horrible thing to say, but I'm glad
###1224 because they would be out in that war now.
###1227 That's one of the reasons I started standing out there, is
###1230 because I knew that in them coffins was someone's son or
###1233 daughter, husband, boyfriend.
###1237 And I just wanted to do something to
###1238 say that I do care.
###1240 But equally I care about all the people that's been lost
###1243 their lives in Afghanistan as well-- the Muslims as well.
###1246 So, I mean, I just don't feel for our soldiers.
###1249 I feel for everybody that's losing their life in this war.
###1253 [EXPLOSIONS]
###1264 [GUNFIRE]
###1269 
###1281 RICH MURPHY: Hi, my name is Rich Murphy.
###1283 I'm a corporal with 2 Para.
###1284 INTERVIEWER: What just happened this morning?
###1285 RICH MURPHY: Eh, full breakfast, and there was the
###1287 cereal as well.
###1289 Obviously, there's a mortar attack on at the moment, so
###1291 we're a bit postponed.
###1293 
###1299 MALE SPEAKER 21: Avril Lavigne is fit as fuck isn't she?
###1301 You're from America.
###1302 Avril Lavigne?
###1303 INTERVIEWER: If you like 12-year-olds, yeah.
###1305 SERGEANT FITZPATRICK: She's fucking rat, mate, I told you.
###1307 See, this is three people.
###1308 This is three people, now, who've said Avril
###1311 Lavigne is turbo rat.
###1312 She's horrible.
###1313 We do not do Avril Lavigne.
###1315 She's like whiskey tango nasty.
###1317 INTERVIEWER: What'd you call it?
###1318 What was your version?
###1318 What?
###1318 SERGEANT FITZPATRICK: Turbo rat.
###1319 INTERVIEWER: Turbo rats.
###1320 SERGEANT FITZPATRICK: Yeah.
###1321 Would you stop gobbing your toothpaste outside my RAP?
###1325 MALE SPEAKER 21: [LAUGH]
###1326 I know it's bad drills.
###1328 SERGEANT FITZPATRICK: It is bad drills, get a grip.
###1329 INTERVIEWER: So you guys are just waiting for
###1331 the wounded in here?
###1332 SERGEANT FITZPATRICK: Pretty much, yeah.
###1334 A lot of sitting around, unfortunately, but, quite
###1337 frankly, I'd rather spend every minute of every day on
###1341 tour sitting around being bored.
###1343 Because if you're doing your job, it means some poor sod's
###1346 having a bad day.
###1347 That's never good.
###1348 [GUNFIRE]
###1356 MALE SPEAKER 22: Get the light, get the light on it.
###1361 MALE SPEAKER 23: [INAUDIBLE]
###1362 MALE SPEAKER 24: [CRYING IN PAIN]
###1370 FEMALE SPEAKER 2: Being a medic's rough.
###1371 You see horrible stuff.
###1372 It's a shame because you have to see soldiers hurt for you
###1375 to do your job.
###1376 
###1381 You get to know them, and then you help them get [INAUDIBLE].
###1387 And that's what makes the medics run out under fire and
###1393 drag their blokes back in.
###1396 MALE SPEAKER 25: Hello, one, zero, bravo,
###1398 this is one, nine.
###1399 I'm going to send nine line in from this location and then
###1401 move to HLS and send it again.
###1403 If you're listening blind or not.
###1405 It'll be marked by smoke, a yellow smoke.
###1408 MALE SPEAKER 26: He's got it on the report.
###1409 
###1415 RICHARD DARE: [INAUDIBLE], an absolute nightmare.
###1418 I really did, I was in a restaurant,
###1420 and I started panicking.
###1422 And I didn't know what to do.
###1424 I could see everything around me, but I could
###1426 see Afghan on top.
###1428 I could see the people just walking around normally, just
###1432 enjoying the fireworks and that.
###1433 And I was sitting here trying to eat my steak.
###1437 And I could see the soldiers around him fighting.
###1440 [INAUDIBLE].
###1441 It was really strange.
###1442 I've never had that before.
###1443 It was like I had the urge to get out and fight.
###1445 [INAUDIBLE]
###1447 And I kept wanting to shout stuff.
###1449 I hold it back.
###1450 And every time I'm holding it back, it kicks off other
###1454 things, and emotions, and go up and down.
###1455 And just holding the head, and I didn't know what
###1458 to do in the end.
###1461 I ate my steak in less than two minutes.
###1464 I was just going for it.
###1466 I was just getting it all or I just would've
###1468 poured my eyes out.
###1469 I didn't know what to do.
###1471 INTERVIEWER: What was your favorite thing about
###1472 being in the army?
###1474 RICHARD DARE: Definitely Afghanistan.
###1474 Definitely.
###1476 
###1478 I miss the company.
###1479 I miss the company of the men.
###1481 And I missed all the action.
###1484 And I just enjoyed everything, everything I did out there.
###1488 As I said, I want to go back.
###1490 Even if it means me getting hit again.
###1493
