2
0:0:4,99 --> 0:0:6,49
MALE SPEAKER: Good
afternoon, folks.


3
0:0:6,49 --> 0:0:8,78
Welcome to today's
"Authors at Talk."


4
0:0:8,78 --> 0:0:13,62
We have Huggy Rao and Bob Sutton
with us, both from Stanford.


5
0:0:13,62 --> 0:0:15,677
And they are incredible
collaborators


6
0:0:15,677 --> 0:0:18,26
who have written this new book
called "Scaling Up Excellence,"


7
0:0:18,26 --> 0:0:20,45
which we will be
discussing with them today.


8
0:0:20,45 --> 0:0:22,16
The format, as you
can figure out,


9
0:0:22,16 --> 0:0:24,82
is a fireside chat between us.


10
0:0:24,82 --> 0:0:28,215
But we will open it up to you
for questions at some point


11
0:0:28,215 --> 0:0:29,8
soon.


12
0:0:29,8 --> 0:0:35,1
Before I get into interactions
with Huggy and Bob,


13
0:0:35,1 --> 0:0:37,97
my first exposure to Huggy
was almost ten years back.


14
0:0:37,97 --> 0:0:41,5
And we were both working
with an Indian nonprofit.


15
0:0:41,5 --> 0:0:43,4
And then a few years
later, we again


16
0:0:43,4 --> 0:0:44,66
connected when I was at Google.


17
0:0:44,66 --> 0:0:48,74
And he is a frequent visitor to
our annual PiLab summit, which


18
0:0:48,74 --> 0:0:53,615
is a gathering that we
have every year, where


19
0:0:53,615 --> 0:0:55,84
we get academics from
different social scientists


20
0:0:55,84 --> 0:0:56,76
to come out here.


21
0:0:56,76 --> 0:1:0,41
And Huggy always asked the most
incisive questions out there.


22
0:1:0,41 --> 0:1:2,37
And he would say,
can I be mischievous?


23
0:1:2,37 --> 0:1:7,84
And ask a critical question
that would really make us think.


24
0:1:7,84 --> 0:1:9,354
And so today, I'm
happy that I get


25
0:1:9,354 --> 0:1:11,52
to ask him the mischievous
questions about his book.


26
0:1:11,52 --> 0:1:15,7
BOB SUTTON: He'll probably
get you a couple times.


27
0:1:15,7 --> 0:1:17,34
MALE SPEAKER: And
Bob is a professor


28
0:1:17,34 --> 0:1:19,42
at the Stanford
engineering school.


29
0:1:19,42 --> 0:1:22,39
And Bob doesn't know this,
but Jennifer Kurkoski,


30
0:1:22,39 --> 0:1:24,55
who leads our People
& Innovation Lab,


31
0:1:24,55 --> 0:1:27,28
said that one of the best
reads, that she has ever


32
0:1:27,28 --> 0:1:30,26
had on the academic
side, is a paper


33
0:1:30,26 --> 0:1:33,68
that Bob authored in ASQ in '96.


34
0:1:33,68 --> 0:1:35,72
This was about
brainstorming an idea--


35
0:1:35,72 --> 0:1:36,56
BOB SUTTON: Oh yeah, that
was a long time ago--


36
0:1:36,56 --> 0:1:38,893
MALE SPEAKER: --and she said,
that was the best research


37
0:1:38,893 --> 0:1:40,61
that she has ever
read that describes


38
0:1:40,61 --> 0:1:42,4
a qualitative methodology.


39
0:1:42,4 --> 0:1:45,65
So we're really excited to
have both of them out here.


40
0:1:45,65 --> 0:1:49,49
They have set up this
program about scaling


41
0:1:49,49 --> 0:1:51,89
that they've been
running at Stanford.


42
0:1:51,89 --> 0:1:54,67
And coming from both the
business school side, as well


43
0:1:54,67 --> 0:1:56,78
as the engineering
side, they really


44
0:1:56,78 --> 0:1:59,7
have a very Googley,
I guess, approach


45
0:1:59,7 --> 0:2:3,45
to thinking about this
huge problem with scaling.


46
0:2:3,45 --> 0:2:6,716
So let's give a warm
welcome to Bob and Huggy.


47
0:2:6,716 --> 0:2:7,85
BOB SUTTON AND HUGGY
RAO: Thank you very much.


48
0:2:7,85 --> 0:2:7,585
Thank you.


49
0:2:7,585 --> 0:2:9,885



50
0:2:9,885 --> 0:2:11,51
MALE SPEAKER: So I
have a few questions


51
0:2:11,51 --> 0:2:12,72
to start off the discussion.


52
0:2:12,72 --> 0:2:17,17
And then we'll get into
some of your questions too.


53
0:2:17,17 --> 0:2:19,59
So the first one,
I guess is, tell us


54
0:2:19,59 --> 0:2:21,27
what you mean by scaling?


55
0:2:21,27 --> 0:2:24,734
And why you thought it was
important to write this book?


56
0:2:24,734 --> 0:2:26,525
BOB SUTTON: I guess,
Huggy's looking at me,


57
0:2:26,525 --> 0:2:28,95
so that means I'm
supposed to go first.


58
0:2:28,95 --> 0:2:32,73
So in the process of thinking
about what this challenge was,


59
0:2:32,73 --> 0:2:35,15
it actually was a
pretty simple problem


60
0:2:35,15 --> 0:2:36,39
that we thought
was going to take


61
0:2:36,39 --> 0:2:37,53
a couple years to figure out.


62
0:2:37,53 --> 0:2:40,4
But some seven years later,
we're still struggling with it.


63
0:2:40,4 --> 0:2:41,77
And it's essentially,
when you've


64
0:2:41,77 --> 0:2:44,28
got a little bit of
goodness in an organization,


65
0:2:44,28 --> 0:2:45,67
how do you spread it further?


66
0:2:45,67 --> 0:2:49,451
So it's everything from,
you've got a startup,


67
0:2:49,451 --> 0:2:51,7
being Googley would be a
good example like, how do you


68
0:2:51,7 --> 0:2:54,54
maintain your Googley-ness
as you get bigger?


69
0:2:54,54 --> 0:2:57,75
And also, spreading
goodness across the system,


70
0:2:57,75 --> 0:2:59,85
and getting rid of bad behavior.


71
0:2:59,85 --> 0:3:4,8
So one of the big things
that led us to this research


72
0:3:4,8 --> 0:3:6,82
was, we were involved in
the founding of the Stanford


73
0:3:6,82 --> 0:3:9,66
d.school, or Hasso Plattner
Institute of Design.


74
0:3:9,66 --> 0:3:13,58
And spreading design thinking or
innovation was a big challenge.


75
0:3:13,58 --> 0:3:16,23
And executives were always
asking us, well, we've


76
0:3:16,23 --> 0:3:18,63
got this one group
that's really great, how


77
0:3:18,63 --> 0:3:19,68
do we spread it further?


78
0:3:19,68 --> 0:3:22,73
So I guess the headline
is, spreading something


79
0:3:22,73 --> 0:3:24,63
good from the few to the many.


80
0:3:24,63 --> 0:3:27,9
And it's a simple problem,
but it's not easy to address.


81
0:3:27,9 --> 0:3:29,42
So that's the basic thing.


82
0:3:29,42 --> 0:3:32,1
HUGGY RAO: A very
complementary addition


83
0:3:32,1 --> 0:3:36,64
to that would be that--
spreading good from one pocket


84
0:3:36,64 --> 0:3:38,67
to many pockets.


85
0:3:38,67 --> 0:3:40,4
You can think of that problem
as a problem of diffusion,


86
0:3:40,4 --> 0:3:41,7
if you will.


87
0:3:41,7 --> 0:3:43,81
But there's also another
dimension of scaling.


88
0:3:43,81 --> 0:3:45,89
And that is, if you're
a small startup,


89
0:3:45,89 --> 0:3:49,94
as you grow rapidly and
become larger in size,


90
0:3:49,94 --> 0:3:52,21
how do you actually
scale successfully


91
0:3:52,21 --> 0:3:53,83
in the sense of
not only achieving


92
0:3:53,83 --> 0:3:58,11
a particular footprint
metric, but also making sure


93
0:3:58,11 --> 0:4:0,13
you retain your mindset.


94
0:4:0,13 --> 0:4:3,46
Let me illustrate that
with a little example.


95
0:4:3,46 --> 0:4:6,92
One of the venture
capitalists mentioned


96
0:4:6,92 --> 0:4:9,39
that the difference between
a startup and a large company


97
0:4:9,39 --> 0:4:13,12
was, startups are
like beach volleyball.


98
0:4:13,12 --> 0:4:14,506
You've got two people.


99
0:4:14,506 --> 0:4:15,63
You don't have substitutes.


100
0:4:15,63 --> 0:4:16,76
You don't have coaches.


101
0:4:16,76 --> 0:4:18,24
You know what the game plan is.


102
0:4:18,24 --> 0:4:20,94
You've got to make sure the
ball doesn't touch the sand.


103
0:4:20,94 --> 0:4:23,96
You're playing volleyball
still, you go from two to six.


104
0:4:23,96 --> 0:4:28,37
All of a sudden, if Prasad
serves from the other end,


105
0:4:28,37 --> 0:4:30,35
I receive the serve.


106
0:4:30,35 --> 0:4:33,83
Bob takes it and supplies
it to Cliff, here.


107
0:4:33,83 --> 0:4:37,72
Cliff arcs into the air and
smashes the ball into the net.


108
0:4:37,72 --> 0:4:39,79
I'm sorry, Cliff.


109
0:4:39,79 --> 0:4:41,906
The interesting problem
is, whose fault was it?


110
0:4:41,906 --> 0:4:45,29
Was it Prasad's serve
that was unplayable?


111
0:4:45,29 --> 0:4:48,21
Was it my fault that I couldn't
receive the serve well?


112
0:4:48,21 --> 0:4:49,72
Or was it the way Bob supplied?


113
0:4:49,72 --> 0:4:51,86
Or was it Cliff's problem?


114
0:4:51,86 --> 0:4:54,34
So you can see, when
you go from two to six,


115
0:4:54,34 --> 0:4:56,88
how very quickly it
becomes a problem.


116
0:4:56,88 --> 0:4:59,14
And you can extend
it, six to 60,


117
0:4:59,14 --> 0:5:4,627
to 600, to 6,000, to
60,000, and the like.


118
0:5:4,627 --> 0:5:5,46
MALE SPEAKER: Great.


119
0:5:5,46 --> 0:5:6,793
Thank you for that introduction.


120
0:5:6,793 --> 0:5:10,36
So given that as the
basis then, if you


121
0:5:10,36 --> 0:5:13,35
have to summarize, what is
the advice that you would give


122
0:5:13,35 --> 0:5:16,81
organizations on how they
should achieve scaling?


123
0:5:16,81 --> 0:5:20,62
And specifically, how would
that differ for a startup,


124
0:5:20,62 --> 0:5:24,3
as you mentioned, versus,
let's say a large organization


125
0:5:24,3 --> 0:5:26,59
like Google?


126
0:5:26,59 --> 0:5:29,8
HUGGY RAO: Let me take
a quick stab at that.


127
0:5:29,8 --> 0:5:34,79
For a startup, I think
the advice that both of us


128
0:5:34,79 --> 0:5:38,18
talk about in the
book is, smart scaling


129
0:5:38,18 --> 0:5:41,43
means that you take time,
and you do it slowly.


130
0:5:41,43 --> 0:5:45,33
We just recently
had an organization


131
0:5:45,33 --> 0:5:50,21
that actually was
acquired by Google, Waze.


132
0:5:50,21 --> 0:5:52,36
And we actually had
one of their executives


133
0:5:52,36 --> 0:5:55,0
come and talk to our class,
and he gave a great example.


134
0:5:55,0 --> 0:5:56,86
They were growing in Israel.


135
0:5:56,86 --> 0:6:0,56
You've got all these resources,
and the VC is saying,


136
0:6:0,56 --> 0:6:3,75
now's the time to expand
higher, higher, higher.


137
0:6:3,75 --> 0:6:7,18
The top managers get
together and say, you know,


138
0:6:7,18 --> 0:6:9,67
now is the time to
have a hiring freeze.


139
0:6:9,67 --> 0:6:11,82
And that's sort of
somewhat counterintuitive.


140
0:6:11,82 --> 0:6:14,5
And people within the company
are astonished, how could you


141
0:6:14,5 --> 0:6:16,78
say you have a hiring
freeze right when you've


142
0:6:16,78 --> 0:6:18,98
got all this money from the VCs?


143
0:6:18,98 --> 0:6:22,62
And the argument
was the following.


144
0:6:22,62 --> 0:6:24,83
The moment you
expand, you actually


145
0:6:24,83 --> 0:6:28,24
are going to get a lot of smart
people with very many ideas.


146
0:6:28,24 --> 0:6:31,92
And since you want to focus on a
particular product application,


147
0:6:31,92 --> 0:6:34,33
you're going to wind up
spending a lot of time


148
0:6:34,33 --> 0:6:37,4
saying no to their smart ideas.


149
0:6:37,4 --> 0:6:38,96
And that's not something
you want to do.


150
0:6:38,96 --> 0:6:41,25
The other interesting
thing was, when


151
0:6:41,25 --> 0:6:44,39
you hire people in a
startup, the smart people


152
0:6:44,39 --> 0:6:46,82
assume they can hit
the ground running.


153
0:6:46,82 --> 0:6:48,79
But often many of them can't.


154
0:6:48,79 --> 0:6:50,85
And very quickly you've
shifted the ratio


155
0:6:50,85 --> 0:6:53,36
of unproductive to
productive people, at least


156
0:6:53,36 --> 0:6:55,117
for a short window of time.


157
0:6:55,117 --> 0:6:56,7
And the third thing
is, of course, you


158
0:6:56,7 --> 0:6:59,89
increase coordination
costs enormously.


159
0:6:59,89 --> 0:7:1,92
So what they did was--
they did a smart thing--


160
0:7:1,92 --> 0:7:4,3
which is hiring freeze.


161
0:7:4,3 --> 0:7:7,1
But they made sure,
during that period,


162
0:7:7,1 --> 0:7:9,8
every single
employee was focused


163
0:7:9,8 --> 0:7:13,41
on one number-- improving
their retention of users


164
0:7:13,41 --> 0:7:14,75
after three months.


165
0:7:14,75 --> 0:7:18,8
And pretty much every day,
you have one question to ask.


166
0:7:18,8 --> 0:7:21,27
What did I do today to
improve that number?


167
0:7:21,27 --> 0:7:23,97
So scaling smartly,
very important


168
0:7:23,97 --> 0:7:25,53
for small organizations.


169
0:7:25,53 --> 0:7:26,94
I'll turn it over to you for
the larger organizations--


170
0:7:26,94 --> 0:7:27,95
BOB SUTTON: --I
get the large end?


171
0:7:27,95 --> 0:7:29,81
Well, I would also
emphasize that there's


172
0:7:29,81 --> 0:7:32,8
a lot of things
that are similar.


173
0:7:32,8 --> 0:7:35,29
And in particular, there's
kind of two principles that


174
0:7:35,29 --> 0:7:36,91
are implied in what Huggy said.


175
0:7:36,91 --> 0:7:39,9
One is the notion that
adding more people


176
0:7:39,9 --> 0:7:40,98
isn't necessarily good.


177
0:7:40,98 --> 0:7:43,5
This notion that many
hands make light work.


178
0:7:43,5 --> 0:7:46,8
And we were actually
talking about this at lunch.


179
0:7:46,8 --> 0:7:49,99
So in 2002, one of my other
co-authors, Jeff Pfeffer and I


180
0:7:49,99 --> 0:7:52,91
interviewed Larry Page, when
Google was about 400 people.


181
0:7:52,91 --> 0:7:55,74
And Larry emphasized how
the venture capitalists


182
0:7:55,74 --> 0:7:58,324
were giving all this grief that
he wasn't hiring fast enough.


183
0:7:58,324 --> 0:8:0,99
And that all of his friends from
Stanford were giving him grief.


184
0:8:0,99 --> 0:8:5,23
But he said, we really have
to slow down, and hire and get


185
0:8:5,23 --> 0:8:7,67
the right people who
can grow with Google.


186
0:8:7,67 --> 0:8:10,2
And I'm not going
to back off on that.


187
0:8:10,2 --> 0:8:12,36
And then, for the book, we
interviewed Shona Brown,


188
0:8:12,36 --> 0:8:14,42
who was quite senior
here for many years


189
0:8:14,42 --> 0:8:16,41
and helped grow sort
of the non-product part


190
0:8:16,41 --> 0:8:18,21
of the organization,
in particular.


191
0:8:18,21 --> 0:8:22,14
And Shona said, we
constantly had this issue,


192
0:8:22,14 --> 0:8:23,97
where people are telling
us to hire faster,


193
0:8:23,97 --> 0:8:26,79
but we had to make sure we got
the right people in the seats.


194
0:8:26,79 --> 0:8:29,503
And I think that's a pretty
good philosophy, , see,


195
0:8:29,503 --> 0:8:32,39
even the small versus
a large company.


196
0:8:32,39 --> 0:8:35,1
But if I was going to talk
about large companies,


197
0:8:35,1 --> 0:8:37,57
one of things that becomes
increasingly important as they


198
0:8:37,57 --> 0:8:41,33
grow larger is-- and this
is Huggy's expression--


199
0:8:41,33 --> 0:8:44,25
is the notion that bad
is stronger than good.


200
0:8:44,25 --> 0:8:47,38
Or the path to greatness
is to get rid of badness,


201
0:8:47,38 --> 0:8:48,87
so bad to great.


202
0:8:48,87 --> 0:8:52,21
And so what happens as
companies get older,


203
0:8:52,21 --> 0:8:55,82
very often sort of bad
behavior or ineffectiveness


204
0:8:55,82 --> 0:8:56,99
starts growing and growing.


205
0:8:56,99 --> 0:9:0,24
And if you just push the
good, and you don't get rid


206
0:9:0,24 --> 0:9:1,822
of the bad, the
bad gets obscured.


207
0:9:1,822 --> 0:9:3,53
And there's lots of
evidence that, things


208
0:9:3,53 --> 0:9:7,46
like laziness, incompetence,
all sorts of difficult things,


209
0:9:7,46 --> 0:9:9,1
just overwhelm the goodness.


210
0:9:9,1 --> 0:9:11,98
So good companies, and
I'll sort of stop here,


211
0:9:11,98 --> 0:9:16,19
they view scaling as a
problem of more or less.


212
0:9:16,19 --> 0:9:18,2
They're always
adding more people,


213
0:9:18,2 --> 0:9:20,635
expanding the more
places and so on.


214
0:9:20,635 --> 0:9:22,26
But in the process,
they're getting rid


215
0:9:22,26 --> 0:9:24,1
of things that are
getting in the way, are


216
0:9:24,1 --> 0:9:26,16
no longer effective.


217
0:9:26,16 --> 0:9:29,2
HUGGY RAO: If I could just
add one more line to that.


218
0:9:29,2 --> 0:9:32,27
The big difference, I would say,
between a small company scaling


219
0:9:32,27 --> 0:9:35,52
and a large company scaling
is that, in a large company,


220
0:9:35,52 --> 0:9:39,73
I would hypothesize that
the larger the company,


221
0:9:39,73 --> 0:9:43,2
the greater the probability
that the smart people inside


222
0:9:43,2 --> 0:9:45,92
are going to become dumber.


223
0:9:45,92 --> 0:9:47,554
What I mean by that
is, obviously I


224
0:9:47,554 --> 0:9:48,47
don't mean to insist--


225
0:9:48,47 --> 0:9:49,678
BOB SUTTON: Take that Google.


226
0:9:49,678 --> 0:9:50,602
[LAUGHTER]


227
0:9:50,602 --> 0:9:52,6
HUGGY RAO: --I
don't mean to insist


228
0:9:52,6 --> 0:9:54,17
that smart people become stupid.


229
0:9:54,17 --> 0:9:57,19
Clearly that's an untenable
position for me to argue.


230
0:9:57,19 --> 0:10:0,79
But what I would say is, that
smart people can become dumb


231
0:10:0,79 --> 0:10:3,7
in the sense of being silent.


232
0:10:3,7 --> 0:10:5,36
And so in a large
enterprise, I would


233
0:10:5,36 --> 0:10:9,5
submit that silence is the
real enemy of excellence.


234
0:10:9,5 --> 0:10:10,38
BOB SUTTON: So
just real quickly,


235
0:10:10,38 --> 0:10:14,1
I was at Pixar yesterday and met
with some of the senior folks.


236
0:10:14,1 --> 0:10:17,587
And one thing that they
did-- because Pixar


237
0:10:17,587 --> 0:10:19,17
is sort of at this
point in transition


238
0:10:19,17 --> 0:10:21,13
where they've kind of grown
up and everything-- and so


239
0:10:21,13 --> 0:10:22,713
Ed Catmull, who is
president of Pixar,


240
0:10:22,713 --> 0:10:25,13
was worried that too many
people were being silent.


241
0:10:25,13 --> 0:10:27,835
And the way Pixar actually
does movies is that, four


242
0:10:27,835 --> 0:10:33,61
or five people who are the brain
trust-- John Lasseter, Pete


243
0:10:33,61 --> 0:10:36,65
Docter, a number of other folks,
who make comments on movies,


244
0:10:36,65 --> 0:10:37,67
and they write notes.


245
0:10:37,67 --> 0:10:39,85
But they had notes
days where everybody


246
0:10:39,85 --> 0:10:41,28
wrote notes about
everything that


247
0:10:41,28 --> 0:10:42,86
could be improved at Pixar.


248
0:10:42,86 --> 0:10:45,1
And it was because they
were worried they had grown


249
0:10:45,1 --> 0:10:47,844
and the silence had
sort of sunk in.


250
0:10:47,844 --> 0:10:49,51
And as they had gotten
larger and older,


251
0:10:49,51 --> 0:10:50,634
there was too much of that.


252
0:10:50,634 --> 0:10:54,1
And that was a
countervailing force.


253
0:10:54,1 --> 0:10:55,63
MALE SPEAKER: The
technology industry


254
0:10:55,63 --> 0:11:0,6
has grown rapidly over
the last few decades.


255
0:11:0,6 --> 0:11:3,62
And within that industry,
there are many companies


256
0:11:3,62 --> 0:11:6,65
that have grown
very, very quickly.


257
0:11:6,65 --> 0:11:9,43
And given your vantage
and your knowledge


258
0:11:9,43 --> 0:11:11,64
of what's happening
in that industry,


259
0:11:11,64 --> 0:11:15,6
do you see the
processes and tools


260
0:11:15,6 --> 0:11:17,876
that technology
companies use to scale?


261
0:11:17,876 --> 0:11:19,25
Are they different
from what used


262
0:11:19,25 --> 0:11:20,84
to happen a generation ago?


263
0:11:20,84 --> 0:11:24,609
Or different from how it
happens in the other industries?


264
0:11:24,609 --> 0:11:26,15
BOB SUTTON: What do
you think, Huggy?


265
0:11:26,15 --> 0:11:28,82
HUGGY RAO: They are
certainly very different.


266
0:11:28,82 --> 0:11:32,9
I mean, if you take Google,
for example, and compare it to,


267
0:11:32,9 --> 0:11:35,579
let's say the median
firm in Detroit.


268
0:11:35,579 --> 0:11:37,37
The way they scale is
very, very different.


269
0:11:37,37 --> 0:11:40,52
Not just in terms of
sheer pace, but also


270
0:11:40,52 --> 0:11:43,25
as you very rightly point
out, the technology.


271
0:11:43,25 --> 0:11:46,14
One advantage is, you
actually have technology


272
0:11:46,14 --> 0:11:48,65
that allows great
decentralization.


273
0:11:48,65 --> 0:11:50,94
But conversely,
technology also that


274
0:11:50,94 --> 0:11:53,65
allows great monitoring as well.


275
0:11:53,65 --> 0:11:57,6
So you actually have both
dimensions of scaling.


276
0:11:57,6 --> 0:12:1,3
Whereas in the older
industries, as it were,


277
0:12:1,3 --> 0:12:5,76
the problem is the
costs of monitoring


278
0:12:5,76 --> 0:12:9,22
are very, very high because
you really lack line of sight


279
0:12:9,22 --> 0:12:10,61
into the enterprise.


280
0:12:10,61 --> 0:12:13,73
Coincidentally, by the way,
our operational definition


281
0:12:13,73 --> 0:12:17,61
of excellence, since both
of us are social scientists,


282
0:12:17,61 --> 0:12:19,63
is not metric-related.


283
0:12:19,63 --> 0:12:22,2
But it simply
means, excellence is


284
0:12:22,2 --> 0:12:25,1
when an organization-- when
people in an organization--


285
0:12:25,1 --> 0:12:28,98
do the right thing, even when
nobody's monitoring them.


286
0:12:28,98 --> 0:12:31,85
Even when nobody is actually
watching over your shoulder.


287
0:12:31,85 --> 0:12:36,18
So I would say the older
generation companies perhaps


288
0:12:36,18 --> 0:12:38,73
invest a little more
in the monitoring part.


289
0:12:38,73 --> 0:12:40,81
Here, the kinds
of individuals who


290
0:12:40,81 --> 0:12:45,3
self-select, they presumably
disdain monitoring, in fact,


291
0:12:45,3 --> 0:12:47,81
otherwise they wouldn't
actually join the organization.


292
0:12:47,81 --> 0:12:49,5
BOB SUTTON: One
thing I would also


293
0:12:49,5 --> 0:12:51,492
add-- I tend to think
of similarities more


294
0:12:51,492 --> 0:12:53,2
than differences--
maybe it's because I'm


295
0:12:53,2 --> 0:12:57,2
an old fashioned,
qualitative researcher.


296
0:12:57,2 --> 0:13:0,7
But when I look even
within tech firms,


297
0:13:0,7 --> 0:13:2,41
it's amazing how--
when organizations


298
0:13:2,41 --> 0:13:4,45
have a different mindset
about how they're


299
0:13:4,45 --> 0:13:7,9
going to do things--
how it affects


300
0:13:7,9 --> 0:13:10,54
a whole bunch of different
decisions about how people are


301
0:13:10,54 --> 0:13:13,917
hired, about how,
actually, a who gets fired,


302
0:13:13,917 --> 0:13:16,25
the incentives, and so on,
and the nature of their work.


303
0:13:16,25 --> 0:13:18,791
And one thing-- and I actually
talked about this a little bit


304
0:13:18,791 --> 0:13:21,1
with your BizOps group about
three or four months ago--


305
0:13:21,1 --> 0:13:24,139
when I think of-- and I already
mentioned this a little bit--


306
0:13:24,139 --> 0:13:25,68
when I think of
Google, I think of it


307
0:13:25,68 --> 0:13:28,54
as a place that has generally
leaned towards generalists,


308
0:13:28,54 --> 0:13:30,18
and people can grow in the role.


309
0:13:30,18 --> 0:13:32,787
And at least, my conversations
with Apple-- and I


310
0:13:32,787 --> 0:13:34,37
can't quote people
because, of course,


311
0:13:34,37 --> 0:13:36,51
they'll shoot me,
it being Apple.


312
0:13:36,51 --> 0:13:38,58
But my conversations
with people at Apple


313
0:13:38,58 --> 0:13:40,3
is-- and I was told
this story directly


314
0:13:40,3 --> 0:13:43,46
by a senior executive-- is
people get more senior here,


315
0:13:43,46 --> 0:13:46,1
they get more specialized.


316
0:13:46,1 --> 0:13:47,741
And if you have an
organization where


317
0:13:47,741 --> 0:13:49,24
you are assuming
people are becoming


318
0:13:49,24 --> 0:13:51,67
more generalists versus
more specialized,


319
0:13:51,67 --> 0:13:54,77
you have to run it in
completely different ways.


320
0:13:54,77 --> 0:13:57,21
And I think that's an important
difference between Google


321
0:13:57,21 --> 0:13:59,75
and Apple, and it doesn't
work perfectly in all cases.


322
0:13:59,75 --> 0:14:1,26
You have certainly
specialists here,


323
0:14:1,26 --> 0:14:2,63
and they have generalists there.


324
0:14:2,63 --> 0:14:4,14
But a sort of exhibit
one-- and this


325
0:14:4,14 --> 0:14:5,77
is what this guy
was talking about--


326
0:14:5,77 --> 0:14:8,15
was what was going to
happen with Ron Johnson


327
0:14:8,15 --> 0:14:9,76
when he went to JC Penneys.


328
0:14:9,76 --> 0:14:12,84
So Ron Johnson was just
extremely focused on,


329
0:14:12,84 --> 0:14:15,11
what's the experience
like an Apple store?


330
0:14:15,11 --> 0:14:17,4
And the way it was described
to me, him and Steve


331
0:14:17,4 --> 0:14:20,7
would argue for like an
hour over exactly what angle


332
0:14:20,7 --> 0:14:22,53
an iPad should be in the store.


333
0:14:22,53 --> 0:14:25,7
And then you give a guy like
that an entire business to run,


334
0:14:25,7 --> 0:14:27,36
the supply chain, pricing,
you add everything.


335
0:14:27,36 --> 0:14:29,667
He would not be prepared
as much to be a generalist.


336
0:14:29,667 --> 0:14:31,75
If you took another company
like General Electric,


337
0:14:31,75 --> 0:14:34,52
it would be sort of the
opposite sort of career path.


338
0:14:34,52 --> 0:14:36,98
So I do think that
tech might have


339
0:14:36,98 --> 0:14:38,58
some of its own
characteristics, but


340
0:14:38,58 --> 0:14:42,9
the company-to-company
variation is just astounding.


341
0:14:42,9 --> 0:14:44,8
Even in the old days,
I remember sitting


342
0:14:44,8 --> 0:14:47,89
in on new training for
Facebook employees.


343
0:14:47,89 --> 0:14:49,63
So this was like--
and half of them


344
0:14:49,63 --> 0:14:51,8
were from Google, by the way.


345
0:14:51,8 --> 0:14:53,98
And I remember Chris Cox,
who's now head of products,


346
0:14:53,98 --> 0:14:56,43
and then head of HR, saying,
yes, you can go in tomorrow,


347
0:14:56,43 --> 0:14:58,91
and you can touch the
code, and you can break it.


348
0:14:58,91 --> 0:15:0,74
And they'd say, we
can't do that at Google.


349
0:15:0,74 --> 0:15:4,72
So the point is that,
the different standards


350
0:15:4,72 --> 0:15:6,74
in companies are very
important for scaling


351
0:15:6,74 --> 0:15:9,51
because-- as Huggy would say--
that in good organizations,


352
0:15:9,51 --> 0:15:12,58
people have a really clear
view of what is sacred


353
0:15:12,58 --> 0:15:13,91
and what is taboo.


354
0:15:13,91 --> 0:15:16,16
And those vary from
organizations to organizations.


355
0:15:16,16 --> 0:15:20,2
And when everybody
agrees, it helps a lot.


356
0:15:20,2 --> 0:15:22,34
BOB SUTTON: As I was
thinking about your question,


357
0:15:22,34 --> 0:15:26,63
what suddenly hit me also,
was the sheer difference


358
0:15:26,63 --> 0:15:31,5
in the physical architecture
between the tech companies


359
0:15:31,5 --> 0:15:33,93
and the old industrial giants.


360
0:15:33,93 --> 0:15:36,82
Open offices and
all of these things.


361
0:15:36,82 --> 0:15:39,0
And I think part of what
the tech companies do


362
0:15:39,0 --> 0:15:43,14
is they provide way
more cues to individuals


363
0:15:43,14 --> 0:15:47,7
to excel than, I would
submit, the large companies.


364
0:15:47,7 --> 0:15:51,28
Let me give you one research
study which actually shows


365
0:15:51,28 --> 0:15:53,3
that when you have
bright lights,


366
0:15:53,3 --> 0:15:55,97
people actually resort
to much less cheating.


367
0:15:55,97 --> 0:15:59,63
Turn down the lamps, the
propensity to cheat increases.


368
0:15:59,63 --> 0:16:4,42
So lamps matter more than
cops, is one simple thing.


369
0:16:4,42 --> 0:16:6,525
And you can go to
any organization


370
0:16:6,525 --> 0:16:10,6
and simply look at, how
bright is the place?


371
0:16:10,6 --> 0:16:11,41
How dark is the place?


372
0:16:11,41 --> 0:16:13,4
That ought to give you
at least an initial kind


373
0:16:13,4 --> 0:16:16,26
of working hypothesis about
what's likely to happen.


374
0:16:16,26 --> 0:16:18,404



375
0:16:18,404 --> 0:16:20,7
MALE SPEAKER: One of
the scaling mantras


376
0:16:20,7 --> 0:16:21,98
that you have in the book.


377
0:16:21,98 --> 0:16:26,294
It is very colorful, it's
called "Feel the Clusterfug"--


378
0:16:26,294 --> 0:16:27,71
BOB SUTTON: It's
"fug" not "fuck."


379
0:16:27,71 --> 0:16:29,376
MALE SPEAKER: --and
the last few letters


380
0:16:29,376 --> 0:16:32,5
are F-U-G, because we know
this is going to be on YouTube.


381
0:16:32,5 --> 0:16:35,15
So tell us what
you mean by that.


382
0:16:35,15 --> 0:16:37,14
BOB SUTTON: You're looking
at me, why don't you go?


383
0:16:37,14 --> 0:16:38,57
HUGGY RAO: OK.


384
0:16:38,57 --> 0:16:45,17
Bob, of course, is well
known to have a tendency


385
0:16:45,17 --> 0:16:49,15
to really aim for very
provocated titles.


386
0:16:49,15 --> 0:16:54,992
His earlier books are inspired,
let's say by various parts of--


387
0:16:54,992 --> 0:16:56,45
BOB SUTTON: The
"no asshole world,"


388
0:16:56,45 --> 0:16:56,75
you can put that, if you want--


389
0:16:56,75 --> 0:16:58,25
HUGGY RAO: Well, there you go.


390
0:16:58,25 --> 0:17:3,73
So originally he was actually
wanting to think of the book


391
0:17:3,73 --> 0:17:6,51
as, maybe we ought
to call it cluster,


392
0:17:6,51 --> 0:17:8,46
and then you know
what the expletive is.


393
0:17:8,46 --> 0:17:11,2
The four letter word
that follows cluster.


394
0:17:11,2 --> 0:17:14,74
And as we were writing
it, the editors of course


395
0:17:14,74 --> 0:17:17,38
said, wait a minute you can't
use something like that.


396
0:17:17,38 --> 0:17:20,119
And fortunately, he
quickly sort of thought


397
0:17:20,119 --> 0:17:25,579
of Norman Mailer, who used the
word "fug" to indicate the act.


398
0:17:25,579 --> 0:17:28,14
And very quickly we
thought of clusterfug.


399
0:17:28,14 --> 0:17:30,765
So that's kind of the
etymology of clusterfug.


400
0:17:30,765 --> 0:17:32,0
Do you want to talk about--


401
0:17:32,0 --> 0:17:33,53
BOB SUTTON: --so you
get to do the fun part?


402
0:17:33,53 --> 0:17:34,32
HUGGY RAO: --I get
to do the fun part.


403
0:17:34,32 --> 0:17:34,97
BOB SUTTON: So
where this came from


404
0:17:34,97 --> 0:17:37,93
is, we were having a dinner with
a guy named Mark Hershon who


405
0:17:37,93 --> 0:17:39,54
actually is a
professional namer.


406
0:17:39,54 --> 0:17:41,94
So he named the BlackBerry,
he named Swiffer,


407
0:17:41,94 --> 0:17:44,122
he's really a good
namer, Dasani water.


408
0:17:44,122 --> 0:17:45,58
And so we were
trying to figure out


409
0:17:45,58 --> 0:17:47,105
what the opposite
of good scaling


410
0:17:47,105 --> 0:17:48,969
was so we came on
this word, clusterfug.


411
0:17:48,969 --> 0:17:50,26
HUGGY RAO: After a lot of wine.


412
0:17:50,26 --> 0:17:51,593
BOB SUTTON: After a lot of wine.


413
0:17:51,593 --> 0:17:55,5
And we realize that there's sort
of three characteristics you


414
0:17:55,5 --> 0:17:58,96
would see, in particular, a
bad IT Rollout at Stanford,


415
0:17:58,96 --> 0:18:0,9
we were thinking of.


416
0:18:0,9 --> 0:18:2,73
Or you can figure out what
happened with Obamacare just


417
0:18:2,73 --> 0:18:3,42
recently.


418
0:18:3,42 --> 0:18:4,98
And when bad things
happen, there's


419
0:18:4,98 --> 0:18:7,28
three characteristics
we always would see.


420
0:18:7,28 --> 0:18:9,41
The first one would be illusion.


421
0:18:9,41 --> 0:18:11,79
That this is going to be so
easy, overconfidence, bias,


422
0:18:11,79 --> 0:18:13,65
we can just roll it out.


423
0:18:13,65 --> 0:18:14,65
So that's the first one.


424
0:18:14,65 --> 0:18:17,28
The second was impatience, and
this is classic with scaling,


425
0:18:17,28 --> 0:18:18,71
we can do this really fast.


426
0:18:18,71 --> 0:18:19,76
No problem.


427
0:18:19,76 --> 0:18:22,38
And then the third
one is, the people


428
0:18:22,38 --> 0:18:23,94
doing it are incompetent.


429
0:18:23,94 --> 0:18:26,18
And that makes
others incompetent.


430
0:18:26,18 --> 0:18:29,83
And to us, those three,
illusion, impatience,


431
0:18:29,83 --> 0:18:33,66
and incompetence, are the
hallmarks of both the causes


432
0:18:33,66 --> 0:18:35,7
and the characteristics
of bad scaling.


433
0:18:35,7 --> 0:18:37,66
And I think that that
happened with Obamacare,


434
0:18:37,66 --> 0:18:39,2
to name a company.


435
0:18:39,2 --> 0:18:43,109
If you sort of dig in to what
happened with poor Groupon.


436
0:18:43,109 --> 0:18:44,9
I hope nobody here used
to work at Groupon.


437
0:18:44,9 --> 0:18:48,37
But if you read the
CEO's resignation letter,


438
0:18:48,37 --> 0:18:53,93
pretty much all three of those
things were raging at Groupon.


439
0:18:53,93 --> 0:18:56,6
And when I look at the
companies in the Valley


440
0:18:56,6 --> 0:18:59,66
that have generally got it
right, they somehow or another


441
0:18:59,66 --> 0:19:0,43
avoid that.


442
0:19:0,43 --> 0:19:3,34
Especially the impatience part
is sometimes the worst thing.


443
0:19:3,34 --> 0:19:5,91
HUGGY RAO: So the implication
behind all of this


444
0:19:5,91 --> 0:19:9,19
is, really scaling up
is easy, but screwing up


445
0:19:9,19 --> 0:19:10,74
is equally easy.


446
0:19:10,74 --> 0:19:14,51
And the problem of course
is when people screw up,


447
0:19:14,51 --> 0:19:18,13
we typically only focus on
what's called, the sharp edge.


448
0:19:18,13 --> 0:19:22,9
You look at a person or persons
and promptly blame them.


449
0:19:22,9 --> 0:19:23,72
But when you really
understand what


450
0:19:23,72 --> 0:19:26,78
causes them to make the
mistake or the screw up,


451
0:19:26,78 --> 0:19:28,98
you quickly realize
there is actually


452
0:19:28,98 --> 0:19:31,23
a confluence of a
couple of things.


453
0:19:31,23 --> 0:19:35,86
One is the psychology,
the illusion part.


454
0:19:35,86 --> 0:19:39,27
And the other is
circulation, or physiology.


455
0:19:39,27 --> 0:19:41,3
And this gets at
the impatience part.


456
0:19:41,3 --> 0:19:44,84
You hasten things, you do
things, you block circulation.


457
0:19:44,84 --> 0:19:48,495
And the third is anatomy,
the structure in who


458
0:19:48,495 --> 0:19:50,73
can occupy positions
in the structure.


459
0:19:50,73 --> 0:19:53,4
So all three of them
kind of to come together.


460
0:19:53,4 --> 0:19:57,8
And the result is, anything
from Sochi, from one extreme,


461
0:19:57,8 --> 0:19:59,22
to the doping scandal in biking.


462
0:19:59,22 --> 0:20:1,88
So you can pick whatever
you want in between,


463
0:20:1,88 --> 0:20:7,43
you pretty much get an idea of
how attempts to reform usually


464
0:20:7,43 --> 0:20:10,87
wind up in clusterfugs.


465
0:20:10,87 --> 0:20:13,3
MALE SPEAKER: Thank
you for sharing that.


466
0:20:13,3 --> 0:20:15,93
I have a bunch more questions,
but if you have anything


467
0:20:15,93 --> 0:20:17,88
please feel free to
line up at the mic.


468
0:20:17,88 --> 0:20:20,47
BOB SUTTON: We would love
to hear some questions.


469
0:20:20,47 --> 0:20:21,67
Torture us, we love that.


470
0:20:21,67 --> 0:20:23,586
MALE SPEAKER: Yes, and
while you're lining up,


471
0:20:23,586 --> 0:20:26,5
let me just continue
with a couple more.


472
0:20:26,5 --> 0:20:31,63
And one of them is, the
role of bureaucracy, right.


473
0:20:31,63 --> 0:20:35,0
And so we often hear
that organizations


474
0:20:35,0 --> 0:20:37,72
grow by instilling a
lot of bureaucracy.


475
0:20:37,72 --> 0:20:40,42
But then that is not
something that people


476
0:20:40,42 --> 0:20:42,75
find very pleasant to bear with.


477
0:20:42,75 --> 0:20:46,99
What is the role that
you see for bureaucracy--


478
0:20:46,99 --> 0:20:49,2
BOB SUTTON: --let me
start out with that.


479
0:20:49,2 --> 0:20:54,346
So bureaucracy seems to
be used as a dirty word.


480
0:20:54,346 --> 0:20:56,22
And to me there's a
difference between having


481
0:20:56,22 --> 0:20:58,96
just enough structure
and just enough process,


482
0:20:58,96 --> 0:21:1,369
versus having stuff
that weighs people down.


483
0:21:1,369 --> 0:21:2,91
And this is a big
scaling issue which


484
0:21:2,91 --> 0:21:4,92
is, when and how
late you add process.


485
0:21:4,92 --> 0:21:7,195
But just to go to what
Huggy's little companies


486
0:21:7,195 --> 0:21:8,74
that-- so there's
a company called


487
0:21:8,74 --> 0:21:12,436
Pulse started by two Stanford
students, Ankit and Akshay.


488
0:21:12,436 --> 0:21:13,81
So we went and we
talked to them.


489
0:21:13,81 --> 0:21:16,84
And they had about 11 or 12
people when we talked to them.


490
0:21:16,84 --> 0:21:18,74
And they were
describing how when


491
0:21:18,74 --> 0:21:20,12
they got about
seven people, they


492
0:21:20,12 --> 0:21:23,5
realized that they have to break
into a couple of teams, two


493
0:21:23,5 --> 0:21:25,39
or three teams,
because it was too big.


494
0:21:25,39 --> 0:21:27,62
Teams over five or six
usually are a nightmare,


495
0:21:27,62 --> 0:21:28,964
especially when you get to 10.


496
0:21:28,964 --> 0:21:30,63
And then when they
got to 11, and that's


497
0:21:30,63 --> 0:21:32,75
about the time where
there are 11 or 12 people.


498
0:21:32,75 --> 0:21:35,649
They're all in one room, sort
of the street in Paulo Alto,


499
0:21:35,649 --> 0:21:37,44
sort of the typical
startup space with sort


500
0:21:37,44 --> 0:21:38,67
of rough floors and everything.


501
0:21:38,67 --> 0:21:40,41
But what they did is they had
them working in three or four


502
0:21:40,41 --> 0:21:41,31
different teams.


503
0:21:41,31 --> 0:21:42,56
So they had division.


504
0:21:42,56 --> 0:21:45,18
And then they each
had a board that they


505
0:21:45,18 --> 0:21:47,43
put with a Post-it note,
what they were working on.


506
0:21:47,43 --> 0:21:49,599
And then every
afternoon, each team


507
0:21:49,599 --> 0:21:51,89
would say, this is what we
work-- they all turn around,


508
0:21:51,89 --> 0:21:53,389
they would announce
the other teams,


509
0:21:53,389 --> 0:21:54,8
this is what we worked on.


510
0:21:54,8 --> 0:21:57,714
Here's the challenges we
need, can you help us?


511
0:21:57,714 --> 0:21:59,505
And to me that's actually
some bureaucracy.


512
0:21:59,505 --> 0:22:0,79
It's some process.


513
0:22:0,79 --> 0:22:3,16
It's some division.


514
0:22:3,16 --> 0:22:5,54
But the challenge,
and this is Chris Fry,


515
0:22:5,54 --> 0:22:9,22
who is now head of Twitter,
some engineering group,


516
0:22:9,22 --> 0:22:11,23
and is going to bring me to
a Commonwealth Club event


517
0:22:11,23 --> 0:22:12,28
with him next week.


518
0:22:12,28 --> 0:22:14,46
And Chris has this
great line which


519
0:22:14,46 --> 0:22:16,64
is that, the
purpose of hierarchy


520
0:22:16,64 --> 0:22:19,33
is to defeat bad
bureaucracy, basically.


521
0:22:19,33 --> 0:22:22,45
And I really like that line
because some time stuff that's


522
0:22:22,45 --> 0:22:25,86
put in causes all this friction,
and that's bad bureaucracy.


523
0:22:25,86 --> 0:22:29,12
But sometimes, I mean you've got
to add a little bit complexity.


524
0:22:29,12 --> 0:22:32,43
And the things he has, his
test is, if what you put in


525
0:22:32,43 --> 0:22:34,149
helps people get
their work done,


526
0:22:34,149 --> 0:22:36,19
but it doesn't feel like
they're walking in muck,


527
0:22:36,19 --> 0:22:37,67
then you're doing
your job right.


528
0:22:37,67 --> 0:22:40,7
And you've always got to
be sensitive to that sort


529
0:22:40,7 --> 0:22:40,71
of balance.


530
0:22:40,71 --> 0:22:43,35
But bureaucracy has
become, appropriately so,


531
0:22:43,35 --> 0:22:45,77
a dirty word because of
the way it's done so often.


532
0:22:45,77 --> 0:22:49,44
But you do need hierarchy,
you do need division of labor,


533
0:22:49,44 --> 0:22:51,51
and you do need process.


534
0:22:51,51 --> 0:22:55,5
Sorry, Google wouldn't work
without all those things, as


535
0:22:55,5 --> 0:22:57,49
warm and fuzzy a
company as it is.


536
0:22:57,49 --> 0:23:0,58
HUGGY RAO: My quick take on
bureaucracy is the following.


537
0:23:0,58 --> 0:23:3,6
I was actually reminded
of the role of bureaucracy


538
0:23:3,6 --> 0:23:7,45
when I was actually at a CTO
forum a couple of days ago.


539
0:23:7,45 --> 0:23:9,42
And one of the
participants, they put it,


540
0:23:9,42 --> 0:23:11,38
I thought, very cleverly.


541
0:23:11,38 --> 0:23:15,25
He said, look, the
great thing about brakes


542
0:23:15,25 --> 0:23:16,94
is they also make you go faster.


543
0:23:16,94 --> 0:23:18,44
BOB SUTTON: He means
brakes on cars.


544
0:23:18,44 --> 0:23:19,106
HUGGY RAO: Yeah.


545
0:23:19,106 --> 0:23:19,78
Brakes on cars.


546
0:23:19,78 --> 0:23:21,42
We often think of
brakes, of course,


547
0:23:21,42 --> 0:23:23,18
as something that limits speed.


548
0:23:23,18 --> 0:23:25,68
But you could plausibly argue,
when you have breaks you


549
0:23:25,68 --> 0:23:27,65
actually go a little
bit faster too.


550
0:23:27,65 --> 0:23:30,85
And it's a little bit
like that for rules.


551
0:23:30,85 --> 0:23:34,275
And the real challenge about
rules and bureaucracies


552
0:23:34,275 --> 0:23:39,1
is whatever you do, you ought
not to increase cognitive load.


553
0:23:39,1 --> 0:23:43,1
And what we talk about in the
book is, if you increase load,


554
0:23:43,1 --> 0:23:44,99
you erode willpower.


555
0:23:44,99 --> 0:23:47,62
And one of our colleagues
did a beautiful experiment,


556
0:23:47,62 --> 0:23:50,67
which actually was a
variation on a theme.


557
0:23:50,67 --> 0:23:52,54
So what he did was
he took a large room


558
0:23:52,54 --> 0:23:55,58
like this, randomly assigned
you to two conditions.


559
0:23:55,58 --> 0:23:57,88
One condition, you
actually had to remember


560
0:23:57,88 --> 0:23:59,294
a unique two-digit number.


561
0:23:59,294 --> 0:24:0,96
The other condition,
you had to remember


562
0:24:0,96 --> 0:24:2,6
a unique seven-digit number.


563
0:24:2,6 --> 0:24:5,3
And all that he does is,
he opens the door there.


564
0:24:5,3 --> 0:24:6,95
And along the
corridors, there are


565
0:24:6,95 --> 0:24:10,62
two tables, one laden with
chocolate dessert, one laden


566
0:24:10,62 --> 0:24:12,0
with fruits.


567
0:24:12,0 --> 0:24:14,37
And lo and behold,
what he finds is,


568
0:24:14,37 --> 0:24:16,62
people who have been asked
to remember the seven digit


569
0:24:16,62 --> 0:24:17,41
number.


570
0:24:17,41 --> 0:24:19,935
They're saying
238-9242 or whatever,


571
0:24:19,935 --> 0:24:21,81
and the next thing you
know is, you're really


572
0:24:21,81 --> 0:24:23,53
kind of attacking the chocolate.


573
0:24:23,53 --> 0:24:26,15
And the guys were told to
remember the two digit number.


574
0:24:26,15 --> 0:24:28,64
They can resist the
temptation of chocolate,


575
0:24:28,64 --> 0:24:31,13
and actually go eat the fruit.


576
0:24:31,13 --> 0:24:33,5
And what we do in
organizations when


577
0:24:33,5 --> 0:24:35,6
we increase
bureaucracy is, we're


578
0:24:35,6 --> 0:24:37,24
actually increasing
demands on people.


579
0:24:37,24 --> 0:24:40,12
Everyone has to remember
the seven digit number.


580
0:24:40,12 --> 0:24:43,27
And then it's no use standing up
and giving a speech and saying,


581
0:24:43,27 --> 0:24:44,26
use your willpower.


582
0:24:44,26 --> 0:24:45,19
They can't.


583
0:24:45,19 --> 0:24:50,39
Because it's all depleted
anyway, and that's the problem.


584
0:24:50,39 --> 0:24:51,64
BOB SUTTON: We got a question.


585
0:24:51,64 --> 0:24:52,12
ALL: All right.


586
0:24:52,12 --> 0:24:52,619
All right.


587
0:24:52,619 --> 0:24:53,21
Thank you.


588
0:24:53,21 --> 0:24:57,875



589
0:24:57,875 --> 0:24:59,25
AUDIENCE: My
question relates to,


590
0:24:59,25 --> 0:25:1,83
one of things I'm hearing
as you're talking,


591
0:25:1,83 --> 0:25:4,38
is that people who,
needing to scale up,


592
0:25:4,38 --> 0:25:6,88
need to change the way in
which they're doing things,


593
0:25:6,88 --> 0:25:7,699
obviously.


594
0:25:7,699 --> 0:25:10,24
One of things I'm thinking, if
I play a role in Google, which


595
0:25:10,24 --> 0:25:12,82
is designed to help people
learn how to do that,


596
0:25:12,82 --> 0:25:14,787
can you teach
people to scale up?


597
0:25:14,787 --> 0:25:16,37
And if so, what are
some of the things


598
0:25:16,37 --> 0:25:17,84
that are important to consider.


599
0:25:17,84 --> 0:25:19,465
BOB SUTTON: So that's
a great question.


600
0:25:19,465 --> 0:25:23,74
And in the mindset that at
least we try to instill, folks,


601
0:25:23,74 --> 0:25:26,98
is constantly think,
what got you here


602
0:25:26,98 --> 0:25:28,79
that won't get you
to the next stage?


603
0:25:28,79 --> 0:25:33,0
And two diagnostic things I
would start with, and then


604
0:25:33,0 --> 0:25:37,52
Huggy maybe you can jump in, is
to go back to this size thing.


605
0:25:37,52 --> 0:25:39,47
Because there are things
that work at one size


606
0:25:39,47 --> 0:25:40,65
that won't work in another.


607
0:25:40,65 --> 0:25:42,93
One of the classic ones,
and one of the companies


608
0:25:42,93 --> 0:25:44,96
we know very well, IDEO.


609
0:25:44,96 --> 0:25:47,7
For years, when I was
doing an ethnography there,


610
0:25:47,7 --> 0:25:49,81
I would go to the
Monday morning meeting.


611
0:25:49,81 --> 0:25:51,4
There would be 60 people.


612
0:25:51,4 --> 0:25:53,38
David Kelly, the CEO,
would run it perfectly.


613
0:25:53,38 --> 0:25:56,62
It got up to 150 even--
everybody would talk,


614
0:25:56,62 --> 0:25:58,12
there would be this
esprit de corps,


615
0:25:58,12 --> 0:26:0,9
150 was just-- it
was a clusterfug.


616
0:26:0,9 --> 0:26:4,44
So they divided it up, and
you sort of had to do it.


617
0:26:4,44 --> 0:26:5,7
So that's one of the things.


618
0:26:5,7 --> 0:26:10,0
And then the other test is
that, back to this idea,


619
0:26:10,0 --> 0:26:11,98
it feels like people
are walking in muck.


620
0:26:11,98 --> 0:26:14,165
And one tool we've
been using-- in fact,


621
0:26:14,165 --> 0:26:16,95
there's a Fortune 500 company
that we just did this with,


622
0:26:16,95 --> 0:26:20,8
where the CEO basically
put $5,000 on the line


623
0:26:20,8 --> 0:26:21,97
for each of the
group presidents,


624
0:26:21,97 --> 0:26:23,84
is we call the subtraction game.


625
0:26:23,84 --> 0:26:26,39
And what we do is we have
people think about what things


626
0:26:26,39 --> 0:26:28,83
are getting in the way,
and subtract stuff.


627
0:26:28,83 --> 0:26:31,82
And it's amazing when
you think about that.


628
0:26:31,82 --> 0:26:32,54
Well if somebody
came in your role,


629
0:26:32,54 --> 0:26:34,53
which part would you take out?


630
0:26:34,53 --> 0:26:37,88
That can be quite powerful.


631
0:26:37,88 --> 0:26:40,1
You have some other
ideas too, but I


632
0:26:40,1 --> 0:26:42,87
do think it's a mindset of
being aware of what is getting


633
0:26:42,87 --> 0:26:45,1
in the way, in weighing us down.


634
0:26:45,1 --> 0:26:47,71
HUGGY RAO: Just as a
quick little extension.


635
0:26:47,71 --> 0:26:51,84
Given your role for us,
the key thing about scaling


636
0:26:51,84 --> 0:26:56,34
is, scaling actually
has inflection points.


637
0:26:56,34 --> 0:26:58,13
So scaling is not
arithmetic, you


638
0:26:58,13 --> 0:27:0,54
have to really think
calculus, if you will.


639
0:27:0,54 --> 0:27:3,39
So as you move from one
inflection point to another,


640
0:27:3,39 --> 0:27:6,86
what worked if you scale,
let's say from zero to 50


641
0:27:6,86 --> 0:27:11,49
units may not work as you move
from 50 to 100, then et cetera.


642
0:27:11,49 --> 0:27:14,39
So the way we think
about these challenges


643
0:27:14,39 --> 0:27:17,97
is, you may start
out as a Catholic,


644
0:27:17,97 --> 0:27:19,97
and by which we mean
you have a model


645
0:27:19,97 --> 0:27:21,62
that you want to replicate.


646
0:27:21,62 --> 0:27:24,61
But as you quickly
go up in scale,


647
0:27:24,61 --> 0:27:26,74
the option that you
really want to think about


648
0:27:26,74 --> 0:27:29,71
is, how can we actually
become Buddhist?


649
0:27:29,71 --> 0:27:34,17
By which we mean that instead
of actually prescribing


650
0:27:34,17 --> 0:27:37,96
every single thing you do, you
outline general principles,


651
0:27:37,96 --> 0:27:40,2
and you give tools to people.


652
0:27:40,2 --> 0:27:44,18
So starting out Catholic
becoming Buddhist


653
0:27:44,18 --> 0:27:46,11
is certainly a useful thing.


654
0:27:46,11 --> 0:27:48,12
Conversely, in large
companies where


655
0:27:48,12 --> 0:27:50,24
there's a lot of bad
behavior, there's


656
0:27:50,24 --> 0:27:52,75
a lot of Buddhism with
respect to bad behavior too.


657
0:27:52,75 --> 0:27:54,5
So there, one of the
things you have to do


658
0:27:54,5 --> 0:27:56,8
is, you have to be pretty
Catholic about what


659
0:27:56,8 --> 0:27:58,6
the bad behavior is.


660
0:27:58,6 --> 0:28:0,26
Stop that one thing.


661
0:28:0,26 --> 0:28:2,67
So those are the
trade-offs that you


662
0:28:2,67 --> 0:28:5,17
have to actually
think of making.


663
0:28:5,17 --> 0:28:8,2
BOB SUTTON: Good question.


664
0:28:8,2 --> 0:28:10,29
AUDIENCE: Hi.


665
0:28:10,29 --> 0:28:11,2
My question.


666
0:28:11,2 --> 0:28:13,77
At Google, oftentimes
we hear this principle,


667
0:28:13,77 --> 0:28:15,54
and we act on them,
and I know I've


668
0:28:15,54 --> 0:28:17,34
done, is "launch and iterate."


669
0:28:17,34 --> 0:28:21,41
Because we don't have
time to scale slow,


670
0:28:21,41 --> 0:28:23,539
that's the advice you
said in the beginning.


671
0:28:23,539 --> 0:28:25,83
Because there's all these
demands that are coming to us


672
0:28:25,83 --> 0:28:28,84
and we need to act
extremely fast.


673
0:28:28,84 --> 0:28:34,35
So how does your idea
of scaling slowly,


674
0:28:34,35 --> 0:28:37,32
would really work with this
"launch and iterate" principle?


675
0:28:37,32 --> 0:28:40,67
BOB SUTTON: To me,
you sort of have


676
0:28:40,67 --> 0:28:42,99
to decide which things
you have to slow down at.


677
0:28:42,99 --> 0:28:45,32
So you can do other things fast.


678
0:28:45,32 --> 0:28:48,3
So I hate to bring up
Facebook, but I will.


679
0:28:48,3 --> 0:28:50,67
They put an enormous
amount of energy


680
0:28:50,67 --> 0:28:53,67
into hiring people and
brainwashing them properly.


681
0:28:53,67 --> 0:28:55,68
So they can move fast
and break things.


682
0:28:55,68 --> 0:28:57,82
So that's even more
extreme than iteration.


683
0:28:57,82 --> 0:28:59,75
And if you have the
right people, and people


684
0:28:59,75 --> 0:29:1,78
who will learn fast
enough, and this,


685
0:29:1,78 --> 0:29:3,82
we teach in the design
school, both of us.


686
0:29:3,82 --> 0:29:6,53
That's our whole
philosophy is rapid


687
0:29:6,53 --> 0:29:9,62
prototyping and moving fast.


688
0:29:9,62 --> 0:29:14,387
And to me, the question is when
you do that, do you create--


689
0:29:14,387 --> 0:29:16,47
are you doing it in such
a way where it's actually


690
0:29:16,47 --> 0:29:18,11
safe to fail?


691
0:29:18,11 --> 0:29:20,78
And if you're moving
fast and breaking things


692
0:29:20,78 --> 0:29:22,31
or doing rapid prototyping.


693
0:29:22,31 --> 0:29:24,29
To me that's just fast learning.


694
0:29:24,29 --> 0:29:25,73
And that should work.


695
0:29:25,73 --> 0:29:28,59
But if you're doing that in
a setting, where it's not


696
0:29:28,59 --> 0:29:33,16
safe to fail, so surgery,
launching an airplane,


697
0:29:33,16 --> 0:29:34,577
keeping the Google
site running, I


698
0:29:34,577 --> 0:29:36,243
mean if people can't
do a Google search,


699
0:29:36,243 --> 0:29:37,89
really bad things are happening.


700
0:29:37,89 --> 0:29:41,18
So I'm all for moving
fast and breaking things


701
0:29:41,18 --> 0:29:43,53
or rapid prototyping
and the like.


702
0:29:43,53 --> 0:29:45,49
But the more skilled
people you've had,


703
0:29:45,49 --> 0:29:47,66
so the more time you
spent hiring them,


704
0:29:47,66 --> 0:29:49,75
and the more they have
actually shared ideas


705
0:29:49,75 --> 0:29:51,25
of what effectiveness
looks like and


706
0:29:51,25 --> 0:29:53,47
doesn't, the faster
you can move forward.


707
0:29:53,47 --> 0:29:58,2
That's why Huggy's metric, Waze,
is that the name that company?


708
0:29:58,2 --> 0:30:1,37
That their metric was, are we
acquiring customers or not?


709
0:30:1,37 --> 0:30:2,819
So that's what success was.


710
0:30:2,819 --> 0:30:3,86
So theirs is agreed upon.


711
0:30:3,86 --> 0:30:6,28
But I'm not saying you
should oh, be a nervous Cindy


712
0:30:6,28 --> 0:30:7,61
and not move fast.


713
0:30:7,61 --> 0:30:9,25
But there are times
in life-- there's


714
0:30:9,25 --> 0:30:11,35
a guy named Jerome
Groopman, who writes stuff


715
0:30:11,35 --> 0:30:14,37
on how doctors do
diagnoses, and sometimes


716
0:30:14,37 --> 0:30:19,89
in life, the best advice he says
is, don't just do something,


717
0:30:19,89 --> 0:30:20,99
stand there.


718
0:30:20,99 --> 0:30:24,42
And a lot of the key to life--
and this is Danny Kahneman,


719
0:30:24,42 --> 0:30:27,404
Nobel Prize-winning stuff
too-- is figuring out


720
0:30:27,404 --> 0:30:28,82
when you go to
that sort of system


721
0:30:28,82 --> 0:30:31,51
too where you actually have to
do deep cognition versus boom,


722
0:30:31,51 --> 0:30:33,31
we can go on automatic pilot.


723
0:30:33,31 --> 0:30:36,13
So I don't think there's any
hard, magic answers there.


724
0:30:36,13 --> 0:30:37,6
But knowing when
to hit the brakes,


725
0:30:37,6 --> 0:30:38,975
so then you can
accelerate later,


726
0:30:38,975 --> 0:30:41,89
to use Huggy's metaphor is a
lot of what scaling and all


727
0:30:41,89 --> 0:30:43,515
of organizational life is about.


728
0:30:43,515 --> 0:30:45,14
HUGGY RAO: Very
quickly, if I can add--


729
0:30:45,14 --> 0:30:46,223
BOB SUTTON: Good question.


730
0:30:46,223 --> 0:30:48,21
HUGGY RAO: I think--
very nice question.


731
0:30:48,21 --> 0:30:51,23
I'm often reminded of a
lovely Latin proverb that


732
0:30:51,23 --> 0:30:53,88
goes something like this,
"Festina Lente," which


733
0:30:53,88 --> 0:30:56,15
means "make haste slowly."


734
0:30:56,15 --> 0:30:57,83
So here's the problem.


735
0:30:57,83 --> 0:31:1,22
The problem is when decision
makers want to scale,


736
0:31:1,22 --> 0:31:4,67
they usually think of
desirability considerations.


737
0:31:4,67 --> 0:31:6,9
What's desirable?


738
0:31:6,9 --> 0:31:9,9
And cognitively, when we
think of what's desirable,


739
0:31:9,9 --> 0:31:12,22
we actually think in
very abstract ways.


740
0:31:12,22 --> 0:31:14,925
We call that the
air war in the book.


741
0:31:14,925 --> 0:31:16,86
You sort of think it's
an air-war problem.


742
0:31:16,86 --> 0:31:18,318
All that you've
got to do is you've


743
0:31:18,318 --> 0:31:19,36
got to launch it all out.


744
0:31:19,36 --> 0:31:21,234
You've got to do this,
you've got to do that.


745
0:31:21,234 --> 0:31:23,5
You think things are
going to really scale.


746
0:31:23,5 --> 0:31:25,69
But real scaling actually
requires great attention


747
0:31:25,69 --> 0:31:29,75
to concrete details, and
to think feasibility.


748
0:31:29,75 --> 0:31:32,71
So you really have to
think about the ground war.


749
0:31:32,71 --> 0:31:34,52
And in order to
fight a ground war.


750
0:31:34,52 --> 0:31:38,96
As you can imagine, a ground war
also is intense, but arguably


751
0:31:38,96 --> 0:31:43,81
that occurs on a somewhat slower
time scale than just an air


752
0:31:43,81 --> 0:31:43,58
war--


753
0:31:43,58 --> 0:31:46,17
BOB SUTTON: And I would add,
back to your prototyping idea.


754
0:31:46,17 --> 0:31:47,84
So the great thing
about prototyping


755
0:31:47,84 --> 0:31:50,35
is, if you're good
prototyper, whether it's


756
0:31:50,35 --> 0:31:53,21
software or a product,
it's really tangible.


757
0:31:53,21 --> 0:31:55,81
You give people-- do you
want the latch like this?


758
0:31:55,81 --> 0:31:58,25
Do you want A or B,
out of AB testing?


759
0:31:58,25 --> 0:31:59,99
So the great thing
about prototyping


760
0:31:59,99 --> 0:32:1,92
is, you actually
got tangibility.


761
0:32:1,92 --> 0:32:3,63
You're not thinking abstractly.


762
0:32:3,63 --> 0:32:7,25
That's like our definition
of a lousy group of Stanford


763
0:32:7,25 --> 0:32:9,85
students or
executives, is they're


764
0:32:9,85 --> 0:32:13,589
talking tangibly, and then
my buddy Diego Rodriguez


765
0:32:13,589 --> 0:32:15,63
from IDEO, when they talk
like that, and he says,


766
0:32:15,63 --> 0:32:16,589
where's your prototype?


767
0:32:16,589 --> 0:32:18,546
And if they don't have
a prototype, he says, F,


768
0:32:18,546 --> 0:32:19,2
and he leaves.


769
0:32:19,2 --> 0:32:23,95
So tangibility is a big
part of that concreteness.


770
0:32:23,95 --> 0:32:24,45
Please.


771
0:32:24,45 --> 0:32:25,866
AUDIENCE: I have
another question,


772
0:32:25,866 --> 0:32:27,18
since nobody else is here.


773
0:32:27,18 --> 0:32:27,4
BOB SUTTON: Oh good.


774
0:32:27,4 --> 0:32:27,899
Yeah.


775
0:32:27,899 --> 0:32:28,42
Go for it.


776
0:32:28,42 --> 0:32:31,38
AUDIENCE: So you said that
you define excellence very


777
0:32:31,38 --> 0:32:34,54
generally, when people do
the right thing when nobody's


778
0:32:34,54 --> 0:32:36,18
watching, something like this.


779
0:32:36,18 --> 0:32:38,86
I think at Google, we
are very metrics-driven.


780
0:32:38,86 --> 0:32:42,5
So we need to define
excellence with metrics.


781
0:32:42,5 --> 0:32:46,1
So what do you discuss
about that in your book,


782
0:32:46,1 --> 0:32:48,722
or you just keep
it very general?


783
0:32:48,722 --> 0:32:50,43
HUGGY RAO: I think
what we talk about is,


784
0:32:50,43 --> 0:32:52,93
when we think about
excellence, we actually


785
0:32:52,93 --> 0:32:55,7
are talking a lot
about accountability.


786
0:32:55,7 --> 0:32:58,4
Accountability actually
has two dimensions.


787
0:32:58,4 --> 0:33:2,91
One dimension is, you feel
like you own the place.


788
0:33:2,91 --> 0:33:6,64
But you can actually do things
to influence development


789
0:33:6,64 --> 0:33:10,97
metrics or whatsoever has been
actually entrusted to you.


790
0:33:10,97 --> 0:33:15,18
The second dimension
really is, but you also


791
0:33:15,18 --> 0:33:17,67
feel the place owns you.


792
0:33:17,67 --> 0:33:20,72
So you need, I think,
the push of commitment


793
0:33:20,72 --> 0:33:22,9
and the tug of obligation.


794
0:33:22,9 --> 0:33:26,6
And what's important
with metrics is,


795
0:33:26,6 --> 0:33:27,59
you want to make
sure you preserve


796
0:33:27,59 --> 0:33:29,53
that feeling of
ownership, and you


797
0:33:29,53 --> 0:33:31,93
create that sense of obligation.


798
0:33:31,93 --> 0:33:35,0
If it's only metrics
that you have-- you


799
0:33:35,0 --> 0:33:37,16
can actually get
to that footprint,


800
0:33:37,16 --> 0:33:39,8
but lose the mindset.


801
0:33:39,8 --> 0:33:41,75
A couple of weeks ago,
there was this company


802
0:33:41,75 --> 0:33:44,78
called Health
Associates, which I


803
0:33:44,78 --> 0:33:47,83
think is a Florida-based company
that actually was indicted


804
0:33:47,83 --> 0:33:49,53
by the attorney
general's office.


805
0:33:49,53 --> 0:33:51,119
Why were they indicted?


806
0:33:51,119 --> 0:33:52,91
Because they were
actually admitting people


807
0:33:52,91 --> 0:33:56,54
into hospitals when there was
absolutely no reason to do so.


808
0:33:56,54 --> 0:33:59,91
And what was fascinating
was the emphasis on metrics.


809
0:33:59,91 --> 0:34:5,9
Every physician had a
color-coded ID, if you will,


810
0:34:5,9 --> 0:34:6,69
on a scorecard.


811
0:34:6,69 --> 0:34:9,23
You beat target, you were green.


812
0:34:9,23 --> 0:34:11,85
You were close to
target, you were orange.


813
0:34:11,85 --> 0:34:14,19
You were below
target, you were red.


814
0:34:14,19 --> 0:34:16,21
And what do you think
these physicians did?


815
0:34:16,21 --> 0:34:17,88
They were admitting
young infants


816
0:34:17,88 --> 0:34:22,31
with temperatures of 98.7,
saying that they were abnormal.


817
0:34:22,31 --> 0:34:24,88
Let them actually get
admitted into the hospital,


818
0:34:24,88 --> 0:34:27,139
because you're actually
increasing revenue.


819
0:34:27,139 --> 0:34:31,4
So there's also a dark
side of accountability.


820
0:34:31,4 --> 0:34:33,51
And the dark side
of accountability


821
0:34:33,51 --> 0:34:37,6
often is realized on the
over-emphasis on metrics.


822
0:34:37,6 --> 0:34:38,87
And we talked at
length about that,


823
0:34:38,87 --> 0:34:40,86
to be very mindful of that.


824
0:34:40,86 --> 0:34:41,96
BOB SUTTON: But I'll
get to what your saying,


825
0:34:41,96 --> 0:34:44,334
but I want to-- and this is
actually very good question--


826
0:34:44,334 --> 0:34:47,395
I wouldn't necessarily directly
disagree with Huggy, but--


827
0:34:47,395 --> 0:34:48,27
HUGGY RAO: Please do.


828
0:34:48,27 --> 0:34:50,739
BOB SUTTON: --but I agree
that you have to-- that things


829
0:34:50,739 --> 0:34:53,29
are more effective-- whatever
the metrics are, when there's


830
0:34:53,29 --> 0:34:55,81
that feeling that, I own the
place, and the place owns me.


831
0:34:55,81 --> 0:34:57,12
And you know what
the larger thing


832
0:34:57,12 --> 0:34:59,16
you're trying to accomplish
is, assuming it's ethical.


833
0:34:59,16 --> 0:35:1,564
Because this would work from
unethical organizations too.


834
0:35:1,564 --> 0:35:3,48
Let's have as many murders
as we possibly can,


835
0:35:3,48 --> 0:35:5,7
might be, for some
organizations,


836
0:35:5,7 --> 0:35:6,44
a reasonable metric.


837
0:35:6,44 --> 0:35:8,86
But if you look at the
cases that we look at.


838
0:35:8,86 --> 0:35:11,682
And three points
in my career, I try


839
0:35:11,682 --> 0:35:13,64
to figure out what
organizational effectiveness


840
0:35:13,64 --> 0:35:14,25
was.


841
0:35:14,25 --> 0:35:17,46
And each time I sort of
succeeded and sort of failed.


842
0:35:17,46 --> 0:35:19,931
And the best I
could do was to say,


843
0:35:19,931 --> 0:35:22,43
in every context you have to
ask the question, effectiveness


844
0:35:22,43 --> 0:35:23,22
of what?


845
0:35:23,22 --> 0:35:24,74
And effectiveness for whom?


846
0:35:24,74 --> 0:35:28,34
And come up with a reasonable
metric in that situation.


847
0:35:28,34 --> 0:35:30,79
So one of the cases
we use in the book


848
0:35:30,79 --> 0:35:34,79
is a group that does
routine knee operations


849
0:35:34,79 --> 0:35:35,99
at a hospital in Boston.


850
0:35:35,99 --> 0:35:38,96
So for them, the
contextualized metrics,


851
0:35:38,96 --> 0:35:42,3
and you have them here at
Google as well, would be,


852
0:35:42,3 --> 0:35:43,607
so how much does it cost?


853
0:35:43,607 --> 0:35:44,69
How much pain are they in?


854
0:35:44,69 --> 0:35:46,481
And how many days are
they in the hospital?


855
0:35:46,481 --> 0:35:48,209
Those are pretty
reasonable metrics,


856
0:35:48,209 --> 0:35:50,25
assuming that they're
dealing with the exceptions


857
0:35:50,25 --> 0:35:53,74
in an ethical case,
in an ethical way,


858
0:35:53,74 --> 0:35:55,65
but I think the
notion of metrics--


859
0:35:55,65 --> 0:35:57,85
I don't think that Huggy
and I would dismiss it.


860
0:35:57,85 --> 0:35:59,433
And believe me,
between the two of us,


861
0:35:59,433 --> 0:36:1,28
he's the one who
can count, not me.


862
0:36:1,28 --> 0:36:4,65
He's one of the best people
in metrics I've ever seen.


863
0:36:4,65 --> 0:36:7,61
But embedding it in the
context is very important.


864
0:36:7,61 --> 0:36:8,15
Please.


865
0:36:8,15 --> 0:36:10,68
AUDIENCE: And probably,
also what you're saying


866
0:36:10,68 --> 0:36:13,54
is too many metrics
could be the dark side,


867
0:36:13,54 --> 0:36:16,109
but just enough, that's
what you should go for.


868
0:36:16,109 --> 0:36:17,9
BOB SUTTON: So one of
my favorite examples,


869
0:36:17,9 --> 0:36:19,941
I can't remember if we
put this in a book or not,


870
0:36:19,941 --> 0:36:22,56
but Jeff Pfeffer and
I, once, years ago, we


871
0:36:22,56 --> 0:36:23,87
were studying Citibank.


872
0:36:23,87 --> 0:36:27,14
And we were introduced to the
most effective Citibank branch


873
0:36:27,14 --> 0:36:29,439
manager in all of the New
York metropolitan area.


874
0:36:29,439 --> 0:36:31,48
So we go in, and they got
this balance scorecard,


875
0:36:31,48 --> 0:36:33,1
they got like 30 measures.


876
0:36:33,1 --> 0:36:34,76
We say, what's the
secret to your success?


877
0:36:34,76 --> 0:36:36,45
He said, I ignore
everything on the scorecard.


878
0:36:36,45 --> 0:36:38,324
And the reason they
think I'm the best person


879
0:36:38,324 --> 0:36:42,22
is that I have the best
profitability of any branch.


880
0:36:42,22 --> 0:36:44,29
And you notice that they
called me the best guy,


881
0:36:44,29 --> 0:36:46,144
and that balance
scorecard is bullshit.


882
0:36:46,144 --> 0:36:47,81
And the other people
who are screwing up


883
0:36:47,81 --> 0:36:49,81
are actually paying
attention to it.


884
0:36:49,81 --> 0:36:55,13
So absolutely too many
metrics are very bad.


885
0:36:55,13 --> 0:36:57,12
I like Huggy's case with Waze.


886
0:36:57,12 --> 0:36:59,98
AUDIENCE: Actually I would also
add that the right metrics are


887
0:36:59,98 --> 0:37:1,21
just as important, right?


888
0:37:1,21 --> 0:37:3,29
Metrics drive behavior.


889
0:37:3,29 --> 0:37:6,59
I think, the question that
I have on the table is,


890
0:37:6,59 --> 0:37:9,26
when we talk about
scaling, I think


891
0:37:9,26 --> 0:37:14,9
you touch upon people, process,
tools, so all those three


892
0:37:14,9 --> 0:37:16,7
things we need to
look at them, right?


893
0:37:16,7 --> 0:37:17,98
And how to prioritize.


894
0:37:17,98 --> 0:37:21,85
And I think you talk about
stopping bad behavior.


895
0:37:21,85 --> 0:37:23,73
And I find that
really interesting,


896
0:37:23,73 --> 0:37:25,67
and I kind of want
to hear your take on,


897
0:37:25,67 --> 0:37:30,77
what are some of the things that
the highly successful companies


898
0:37:30,77 --> 0:37:33,89
do in dealing with
the people issue?


899
0:37:33,89 --> 0:37:36,98
Because you do hire
different people


900
0:37:36,98 --> 0:37:40,9
with different capabilities
as the company grows.


901
0:37:40,9 --> 0:37:41,81
Because the needs change.


902
0:37:41,81 --> 0:37:45,55
So but you go enter with
different players on the field.


903
0:37:45,55 --> 0:37:48,94
How do you make them
work together, right?


904
0:37:48,94 --> 0:37:48,76
HUGGY RAO: Yeah.


905
0:37:48,76 --> 0:37:50,53
That's a great question as well.


906
0:37:50,53 --> 0:37:53,35
So the first thing
about bad behavior.


907
0:37:53,35 --> 0:37:55,93
The very basic finding,
robust finding,


908
0:37:55,93 --> 0:37:58,83
is bad's way stronger than good.


909
0:37:58,83 --> 0:38:2,29
In one study of marital
relationships, what is it?


910
0:38:2,29 --> 0:38:5,47
For every nasty thing you
tell your partner, or spouse,


911
0:38:5,47 --> 0:38:7,5
you have to say five
good things at least--


912
0:38:7,5 --> 0:38:9,83
BOB SUTTON: Or it's
not going to last.


913
0:38:9,83 --> 0:38:12,54
HUGGY RAO: --and you can
imagine the, sort of, asymmetry.


914
0:38:12,54 --> 0:38:16,88
The thing about bad behavior
is, bad behavior basically


915
0:38:16,88 --> 0:38:19,654
is a signal that nobody cares.


916
0:38:19,654 --> 0:38:21,7
And that's the
reason why you have


917
0:38:21,7 --> 0:38:24,2
to actually get to
it very quickly.


918
0:38:24,2 --> 0:38:29,94
And it might actually
have to do with waste,


919
0:38:29,94 --> 0:38:31,61
it might have to
do with delay, it


920
0:38:31,61 --> 0:38:34,87
might have to do with
outright malfeasance, whatever


921
0:38:34,87 --> 0:38:38,36
the manifestation
of bad behavior is.


922
0:38:38,36 --> 0:38:39,95
But the important
thing to realize,


923
0:38:39,95 --> 0:38:41,82
and we talk about
in the book is,


924
0:38:41,82 --> 0:38:43,56
you don't want to
leap to the conclusion


925
0:38:43,56 --> 0:38:46,93
that bad behavior is the
product of bad people.


926
0:38:46,93 --> 0:38:49,9
Good people do bad things.


927
0:38:49,9 --> 0:38:52,66
Because they're mostly
responding to the system


928
0:38:52,66 --> 0:38:53,5
that's there.


929
0:38:53,5 --> 0:38:57,38
And you guys at Google do a
marvelous job of making sure--


930
0:38:57,38 --> 0:39:1,32
when you think of people
who aren't performing,


931
0:39:1,32 --> 0:39:4,41
how you actually reduce
variance in performance,


932
0:39:4,41 --> 0:39:6,97
by giving them a new
start and so forth.


933
0:39:6,97 --> 0:39:11,29
So very important to make sure
you come to terms with the fact


934
0:39:11,29 --> 0:39:14,42
that why are bad people--
why are good people doing


935
0:39:14,42 --> 0:39:15,34
bad things?


936
0:39:15,34 --> 0:39:17,49
And here, context matters.


937
0:39:17,49 --> 0:39:20,44
At the other extreme, what
we talk about in the book is,


938
0:39:20,44 --> 0:39:23,831
people do bad things
because bad involves thrill.


939
0:39:23,831 --> 0:39:25,58
And one of the things
you've got to you've


940
0:39:25,58 --> 0:39:27,89
got to kill the thrill.


941
0:39:27,89 --> 0:39:31,35
We actually have an example of a
nice study done by psychologist


942
0:39:31,35 --> 0:39:37,5
about a factory where they
were actually stealing tools.


943
0:39:37,5 --> 0:39:38,251
So what do you do?


944
0:39:38,251 --> 0:39:39,875
BOB SUTTON: Like big
tools, like things


945
0:39:39,875 --> 0:39:41,13
that weighed 1,000 pounds.


946
0:39:41,13 --> 0:39:42,796
HUGGY RAO: They're
all taking them home.


947
0:39:42,796 --> 0:39:46,65
So you can think of, oh my
god, I'm going to put fines.


948
0:39:46,65 --> 0:39:48,76
No, I'm going to appoint guards.


949
0:39:48,76 --> 0:39:50,79
No, we're going to
have video cameras.


950
0:39:50,79 --> 0:39:52,95
So these guys thought about
it, and they came back


951
0:39:52,95 --> 0:39:56,27
with a very strikingly
counter intuitive solution.


952
0:39:56,27 --> 0:39:59,76
They said, hey, we actually
have a lending library here.


953
0:39:59,76 --> 0:40:3,89
You guys can borrow the tools,
and if you've been late,


954
0:40:3,89 --> 0:40:7,3
there's an amnesty, you
can always turn it back in.


955
0:40:7,3 --> 0:40:10,43
So once there was no prohibition
about taking the tools,


956
0:40:10,43 --> 0:40:11,9
the thrill of
stealing was kind of


957
0:40:11,9 --> 0:40:14,876
lost because anybody
could take any tool.


958
0:40:14,876 --> 0:40:16,25
And of course,
these workers were


959
0:40:16,25 --> 0:40:18,33
being pressured by
their wives saying,


960
0:40:18,33 --> 0:40:21,66
you're messing up the art
and taking up too much space.


961
0:40:21,66 --> 0:40:25,4
Please return those damn
tools back to your factory.


962
0:40:25,4 --> 0:40:27,15
So they were able to
stop it like that.


963
0:40:27,15 --> 0:40:30,25
So those are the two
bookends, if you will of that.


964
0:40:30,25 --> 0:40:32,52
BOB SUTTON: In this story,
I like to use the metric.


965
0:40:32,52 --> 0:40:35,61
They went from having a million
dollars worth of stuff a year


966
0:40:35,61 --> 0:40:37,472
stolen to nothing, just by
saying, here it's yours.


967
0:40:37,472 --> 0:40:39,43
This was a great example
of killing the thrill.


968
0:40:39,43 --> 0:40:40,66
And they would just
steal things that


969
0:40:40,66 --> 0:40:43,76
were hard to steal, just because
it was fun to steal them,


970
0:40:43,76 --> 0:40:45,876
not because they needed them.


971
0:40:45,876 --> 0:40:48,0
HUGGY RAO: The other thing
you have to keep in mind


972
0:40:48,0 --> 0:40:52,67
is-- and I just want
to connect the metrics


973
0:40:52,67 --> 0:40:55,37
and kind of bad
behavior-- this isn't


974
0:40:55,37 --> 0:40:57,95
a conclusion by any means,
but at least a good null


975
0:40:57,95 --> 0:40:59,25
hypothesis.


976
0:40:59,25 --> 0:41:1,99
When there are lots of
metrics, a good null


977
0:41:1,99 --> 0:41:6,76
hypothesis to begin is, you have
smart people who are afraid.


978
0:41:6,76 --> 0:41:9,49
Because if all of the metrics
were highly correlated,


979
0:41:9,49 --> 0:41:11,27
they would all load
into one factor.


980
0:41:11,27 --> 0:41:13,0
So obviously you
don't need 30 metrics


981
0:41:13,0 --> 0:41:15,559
because the intercorrelations
are so high.


982
0:41:15,559 --> 0:41:17,6
And the reason they're
not going to be correlated


983
0:41:17,6 --> 0:41:19,4
is you going to look
good on some things.


984
0:41:19,4 --> 0:41:20,873
BOB SUTTON: I would
also add, independently,


985
0:41:20,873 --> 0:41:23,257
the fear-- I actually
did some early consulting


986
0:41:23,257 --> 0:41:25,84
work a litttle with HP on this
when they had too many metrics.


987
0:41:25,84 --> 0:41:29,2
And what ends up happening
is, in terms of having


988
0:41:29,2 --> 0:41:32,8
the same mindset and
people in the same page is,


989
0:41:32,8 --> 0:41:35,27
the whole game becomes-- so
you're a general manager at HP.


990
0:41:35,27 --> 0:41:37,75
In the old days,
there's 54 divisions


991
0:41:37,75 --> 0:41:40,91
and you're assessed on like
30 or 40 different metrics.


992
0:41:40,91 --> 0:41:42,33
Your job is to
convince everybody


993
0:41:42,33 --> 0:41:43,789
that the one metric
you're great on


994
0:41:43,789 --> 0:41:45,246
is what you should
be evaluated on.


995
0:41:45,246 --> 0:41:47,8
So this whole
political gamesmanship


996
0:41:47,8 --> 0:41:50,14
went on that had nothing
to do with actually


997
0:41:50,14 --> 0:41:51,58
moving the company forward.


998
0:41:51,58 --> 0:41:52,41
Yes.


999
0:41:52,41 --> 0:41:54,6
You have a question here.


1000
0:41:54,6 --> 0:41:56,58
AUDIENCE: Thank you for coming
here, and writing the book.


1001
0:41:56,58 --> 0:41:57,496
BOB SUTTON: Thank you.


1002
0:41:57,496 --> 0:41:59,36
AUDIENCE: I wanted
to ask about the step


1003
0:41:59,36 --> 0:42:0,98
before you worry about scaling.


1004
0:42:0,98 --> 0:42:4,131
There is a lot of
theories, and Paul Graham


1005
0:42:4,131 --> 0:42:6,13
I think wrote an article
a few months back that,


1006
0:42:6,13 --> 0:42:8,1
startups should never
worry about scaling,


1007
0:42:8,1 --> 0:42:11,23
should just get the prototype,
learn as much as you can.


1008
0:42:11,23 --> 0:42:14,5
And I've actually
managed startups


1009
0:42:14,5 --> 0:42:18,42
where we had a great product.


1010
0:42:18,42 --> 0:42:20,982
We had the team of people
that were not aligned.


1011
0:42:20,982 --> 0:42:22,94
And we had the three
issues that you mentioned,


1012
0:42:22,94 --> 0:42:27,92
incompetence, the
impatience, and the illusion.


1013
0:42:27,92 --> 0:42:29,68
And I sort of said, OK.


1014
0:42:29,68 --> 0:42:30,98
Let's stop.


1015
0:42:30,98 --> 0:42:33,74
And let's try to figure
out what's going on.


1016
0:42:33,74 --> 0:42:35,29
And improve it based on that.


1017
0:42:35,29 --> 0:42:36,53
And then worry about scaling.


1018
0:42:36,53 --> 0:42:38,65
It's not about getting
more customers, et cetera.


1019
0:42:38,65 --> 0:42:41,274
BOB SUTTON: I think you answered
your own question brilliantly.


1020
0:42:41,274 --> 0:42:43,424
And the way that we
say this, and it's


1021
0:42:43,424 --> 0:42:45,59
one of those things that
is so obvious, it's stupid.


1022
0:42:45,59 --> 0:42:48,52
But companies
sometimes forget it.


1023
0:42:48,52 --> 0:42:50,2
Which is to spread
excellence, you


1024
0:42:50,2 --> 0:42:52,2
have to have
excellence to spread.


1025
0:42:52,2 --> 0:42:54,81
And so you've got
to stop-- and that's


1026
0:42:54,81 --> 0:42:58,2
why to quote Huggy--
it's a ground war,


1027
0:42:58,2 --> 0:42:58,94
it's not an air war.


1028
0:42:58,94 --> 0:43:0,944
When you have real
excellence, you actually


1029
0:43:0,944 --> 0:43:2,36
create that little
pocket in them.


1030
0:43:2,36 --> 0:43:3,735
And especially if
you have money.


1031
0:43:3,735 --> 0:43:5,76
Money's dangerous.


1032
0:43:5,76 --> 0:43:6,742
And I think you're
Waze example is great


1033
0:43:6,742 --> 0:43:7,825
because it's a temptation.


1034
0:43:7,825 --> 0:43:10,32
Let's build it out and hire
a huge sales organization


1035
0:43:10,32 --> 0:43:11,51
before we have something
that we're selling


1036
0:43:11,51 --> 0:43:12,92
is a classic thing
that's happening


1037
0:43:12,92 --> 0:43:15,211
in many of our over funded
startups in the Valley right


1038
0:43:15,211 --> 0:43:15,76
now.


1039
0:43:15,76 --> 0:43:17,98
And that's one advantage
that Larry and Sergey took


1040
0:43:17,98 --> 0:43:19,7
a long time for
them to sell Google,


1041
0:43:19,7 --> 0:43:22,85
so they actually had to work on
making the thing even better.


1042
0:43:22,85 --> 0:43:26,1
And just to give you an example,
in the IT rollout space.


1043
0:43:26,1 --> 0:43:28,0
One of my favorite
cases in the book,


1044
0:43:28,0 --> 0:43:31,91
at the end of chapter
two, is a great rollout


1045
0:43:31,91 --> 0:43:36,23
of medical care,
electronic medical care


1046
0:43:36,23 --> 0:43:37,59
records at Kaiser Permanente.


1047
0:43:37,59 --> 0:43:40,73
And the way they did it, this
woman named Louise Lang led it.


1048
0:43:40,73 --> 0:43:44,846
It was about six or seven year
process, cost about $5 billion.


1049
0:43:44,846 --> 0:43:46,47
Kaiser's the biggest
health care system


1050
0:43:46,47 --> 0:43:48,5
in the country, private
health care system.


1051
0:43:48,5 --> 0:43:51,45
They got it working perfectly in
the smallest region in Hawaii.


1052
0:43:51,45 --> 0:43:53,822
They got it just, worked
and worked and worked.


1053
0:43:53,822 --> 0:43:55,28
And once that
started working, then


1054
0:43:55,28 --> 0:43:57,7
they went to the next
region, once it was working,


1055
0:43:57,7 --> 0:43:58,2
went to the next one.


1056
0:43:58,2 --> 0:44:0,66
So they didn't spread that
thin coat of whatever.


1057
0:44:0,66 --> 0:44:3,89
They got it humming, and then
they spread that excellence.


1058
0:44:3,89 --> 0:44:6,821
So your example in the startup,
I think, is exactly right.


1059
0:44:6,821 --> 0:44:9,7
And that's one reason that--
probably most people know


1060
0:44:9,7 --> 0:44:11,49
this evidence-- there's a lot
of evidence of startups that


1061
0:44:11,49 --> 0:44:17,56
are started in downturns are
more likely to survive and grow


1062
0:44:17,56 --> 0:44:19,811
into larger companies than
upturns because they-- well


1063
0:44:19,811 --> 0:44:22,268
first of all, don't have too
much money, and second of all,


1064
0:44:22,268 --> 0:44:24,2
they have to take time
to do stuff right.


1065
0:44:24,2 --> 0:44:27,66
And I remember when we
interviewed Larry Page in 2002,


1066
0:44:27,66 --> 0:44:31,6
I could not figure out whether
he was the last dot.com person


1067
0:44:31,6 --> 0:44:33,937
standing, or actually,
he was on to something.


1068
0:44:33,937 --> 0:44:36,2
Because all the other
companies seemed to be dead.


1069
0:44:36,2 --> 0:44:38,642
And then there was
this guy, Larry Page,


1070
0:44:38,642 --> 0:44:40,85
who claimed that he was
going to grow a huge company.


1071
0:44:40,85 --> 0:44:42,84
And I guess he was right.


1072
0:44:42,84 --> 0:44:45,55
So I think you've got it, man.


1073
0:44:45,55 --> 0:44:46,93
AUDIENCE: So I guess
the core of my question,


1074
0:44:46,93 --> 0:44:48,88
and based on your
experience, and maybe it


1075
0:44:48,88 --> 0:44:51,28
might be your next book
which is, how do you


1076
0:44:51,28 --> 0:44:53,415
infuse excellence
in the first place?


1077
0:44:53,415 --> 0:44:54,4
BOB SUTTON: OK.


1078
0:44:54,4 --> 0:44:54,956
Huggy you answer that.


1079
0:44:54,956 --> 0:44:55,814
That's too hard.


1080
0:44:55,814 --> 0:44:57,23
Huggy gets all the
hard questions.


1081
0:44:57,23 --> 0:44:58,63
He's the smart one--


1082
0:44:58,63 --> 0:44:58,987
HUGGY RAO: I think--


1083
0:44:58,987 --> 0:44:59,82
BOB SUTTON: --He is.


1084
0:44:59,82 --> 0:45:2,21
If there was an IQ test right
now, [INAUDIBLE] happen.


1085
0:45:2,21 --> 0:45:5,62
HUGGY RAO: So this
actually dovetails


1086
0:45:5,62 --> 0:45:8,61
quite nicely with one of
the core beliefs at Google


1087
0:45:8,61 --> 0:45:11,59
and really your own
experience here.


1088
0:45:11,59 --> 0:45:14,15
I think the heart of
infusing excellence


1089
0:45:14,15 --> 0:45:17,57
is really how you hire people.


1090
0:45:17,57 --> 0:45:20,3
That's one part.


1091
0:45:20,3 --> 0:45:23,12
And real excellence
also means, how do you


1092
0:45:23,12 --> 0:45:27,84
get extraordinary performance
out of ordinary individuals?


1093
0:45:27,84 --> 0:45:29,98
So hiring talent
doesn't sort of mean,


1094
0:45:29,98 --> 0:45:33,6
well we're actually going
to get the very best people.


1095
0:45:33,6 --> 0:45:35,49
And we're going to pay a
whole lot and so forth.


1096
0:45:35,49 --> 0:45:37,84
You can actually get
amazing performance


1097
0:45:37,84 --> 0:45:39,88
from ordinary individuals.


1098
0:45:39,88 --> 0:45:43,2
And here, changing
the context matters.


1099
0:45:43,2 --> 0:45:44,99
One of the cases
that we talk about,


1100
0:45:44,99 --> 0:45:48,2
which was actually written by a
colleague of ours at Stanford,


1101
0:45:48,2 --> 0:45:51,4
is about a company called
Tomago-ya in Japan.


1102
0:45:51,4 --> 0:45:56,6
And what Tomago-ya does is
they deliver lunch to offices,


1103
0:45:56,6 --> 0:45:59,3
$3.60 per lunch.


1104
0:45:59,3 --> 0:46:2,36
And it's a little Bento box.


1105
0:46:2,36 --> 0:46:4,63
So every day you can
order the lunch you want.


1106
0:46:4,63 --> 0:46:7,8
The last order is at 10 o'clock.


1107
0:46:7,8 --> 0:46:9,9
And you've got to
deliver the lunch by 12.


1108
0:46:9,9 --> 0:46:12,51
The amazing thing is, their
factory is more than 2.5 hours


1109
0:46:12,51 --> 0:46:15,83
away from the business
district of Tokyo, Shinjuku,


1110
0:46:15,83 --> 0:46:17,53
but you've got to
deliver the lunch.


1111
0:46:17,53 --> 0:46:20,98
So the problem is, how do you
actually wait until 10 o'clock


1112
0:46:20,98 --> 0:46:22,53
and deliver the lunch?


1113
0:46:22,53 --> 0:46:26,6
And every day they
serve 70,000 lunches.


1114
0:46:26,6 --> 0:46:30,27
And the average
waste, if you will,


1115
0:46:30,27 --> 0:46:33,91
the underage, or in
their case, the overage,


1116
0:46:33,91 --> 0:46:38,63
is that on 46 lunches,
which translates to 0.06.


1117
0:46:38,63 --> 0:46:41,94
My colleague, who wrote
the case, asked the CEO.


1118
0:46:41,94 --> 0:46:42,26
He says, how do you do that?


1119
0:46:42,26 --> 0:46:44,89
Do you guys have very
sophisticated algorithms,


1120
0:46:44,89 --> 0:46:47,85
where you can process
orders, route trucks.


1121
0:46:47,85 --> 0:46:49,14
He says no.


1122
0:46:49,14 --> 0:46:50,44
How do you do that?


1123
0:46:50,44 --> 0:46:53,42
And he says, well, we
make sure our trucks leave


1124
0:46:53,42 --> 0:46:55,94
before the first order comes.


1125
0:46:55,94 --> 0:46:57,78
And the guy says,
how can you do that?


1126
0:46:57,78 --> 0:47:0,79
How can you get trucks to
leave your facility at 8:00


1127
0:47:0,79 --> 0:47:4,6
in the morning to the farthest
the [INAUDIBLE] customers


1128
0:47:4,6 --> 0:47:6,58
even before you got the orders?


1129
0:47:6,58 --> 0:47:10,2
And the guy says, the key
people are our van drivers,


1130
0:47:10,2 --> 0:47:11,83
who deliver the lunches.


1131
0:47:11,83 --> 0:47:13,93
They can actually
pick the customer.


1132
0:47:13,93 --> 0:47:17,51
And once the lunch is over,
these are reusable Bento boxes.


1133
0:47:17,51 --> 0:47:20,47
You can go and pick the
Bento box up, talk to people,


1134
0:47:20,47 --> 0:47:23,46
and quickly find out what the
nature of demand the next day


1135
0:47:23,46 --> 0:47:24,0
is.


1136
0:47:24,0 --> 0:47:26,1
And in the evening,
they tell their boss.


1137
0:47:26,1 --> 0:47:29,87
By the way, a small
district actually


1138
0:47:29,87 --> 0:47:32,63
is managed by one of
these area managers.


1139
0:47:32,63 --> 0:47:34,59
And then you'll
funnel it upwards,


1140
0:47:34,59 --> 0:47:36,45
and that's really what it is.


1141
0:47:36,45 --> 0:47:39,18
And my colleague said,
now, who designed this?


1142
0:47:39,18 --> 0:47:42,72
And the founder said, you
know, me and the truck drivers.


1143
0:47:42,72 --> 0:47:44,73
And he said, who are
the truck drivers?


1144
0:47:44,73 --> 0:47:46,55
And this is the
striking part, they


1145
0:47:46,55 --> 0:47:50,4
are all people who are
high school dropouts.


1146
0:47:50,4 --> 0:47:51,9
Now, it's true that
there are bonuses


1147
0:47:51,9 --> 0:47:53,56
that link to any weigh stage.


1148
0:47:53,56 --> 0:47:56,8
But the point is,
it's not just that.


1149
0:47:56,8 --> 0:47:58,77
You've given them
a second chance.


1150
0:47:58,77 --> 0:48:1,19
And you are really getting
extraordinary performance


1151
0:48:1,19 --> 0:48:5,81
out of people who could arguably
be labeled C or B, or whatever.


1152
0:48:5,81 --> 0:48:9,939
So very important to
keep that in mind.


1153
0:48:9,939 --> 0:48:11,73
AUDIENCE: I'll make it
a little bit harder.


1154
0:48:11,73 --> 0:48:17,74
So you go into a startup,
small team, one star.


1155
0:48:17,74 --> 0:48:20,36



1156
0:48:20,36 --> 0:48:24,45
Most of the others are B's
and a few, let's call, F's.


1157
0:48:24,45 --> 0:48:28,1
And you start getting rid of
the F's because it's just not


1158
0:48:28,1 --> 0:48:29,0
working.


1159
0:48:29,0 --> 0:48:31,12
And then you end up
with a smaller team,


1160
0:48:31,12 --> 0:48:32,95
with the VCs shouting at you.


1161
0:48:32,95 --> 0:48:36,88
And you're running out of
money, product's not performing.


1162
0:48:36,88 --> 0:48:41,58
The excellence, the culture of
the company is just struggling.


1163
0:48:41,58 --> 0:48:46,44
And all of the elements
are against you,


1164
0:48:46,44 --> 0:48:48,0
as any other startup.


1165
0:48:48,0 --> 0:48:50,63
And then to infuse a
culture of excellence


1166
0:48:50,63 --> 0:48:55,73
into a place that got used to
being sub-mediocre performance


1167
0:48:55,73 --> 0:48:58,82
is something I really
struggled with personally


1168
0:48:58,82 --> 0:48:59,9
in a previous life.


1169
0:48:59,9 --> 0:49:3,38
And I want to just see
what is your take on how


1170
0:49:3,38 --> 0:49:5,537
that could that be handled.


1171
0:49:5,537 --> 0:49:7,37
HUGGY RAO: I can certainly
feel your pain is


1172
0:49:7,37 --> 0:49:8,53
one thing I can say.


1173
0:49:8,53 --> 0:49:10,21
I'm being mischievous here.


1174
0:49:10,21 --> 0:49:14,0
But in the hypothetical example,
or the reconstructed example


1175
0:49:14,0 --> 0:49:17,36
out of your experience that
you gave, you've got one star,


1176
0:49:17,36 --> 0:49:21,86
you've taken out
the F's, I assume.


1177
0:49:21,86 --> 0:49:25,342
And you've got the B people
as it were, so to speak.


1178
0:49:25,342 --> 0:49:26,8
And one of the
things we talk about


1179
0:49:26,8 --> 0:49:31,19
is, scaling isn't just
about stars, it's actually


1180
0:49:31,19 --> 0:49:33,37
about your sherpas, too.


1181
0:49:33,37 --> 0:49:35,74
I mean think of how you
get to the top of Everest.


1182
0:49:35,74 --> 0:49:37,344
Three people get
there, that's true.


1183
0:49:37,344 --> 0:49:39,1
But there's a lot of
people who actually


1184
0:49:39,1 --> 0:49:40,88
do all the heavy lifting
to help you get there.


1185
0:49:40,88 --> 0:49:41,85
BOB SUTTON: The
Sherpas are the stars,


1186
0:49:41,85 --> 0:49:43,558
and the other people
just pay them money.


1187
0:49:43,558 --> 0:49:46,4
So [INAUDIBLE] the question
where the stars is.


1188
0:49:46,4 --> 0:49:49,31
HUGGY RAO: So the real challenge
is, how do you actually


1189
0:49:49,31 --> 0:49:53,12
get great performance out of
people who are at the B level?


1190
0:49:53,12 --> 0:49:55,4
And one simple place to start.


1191
0:49:55,4 --> 0:49:59,1
It's by no means a
sure fire bullet is,


1192
0:49:59,1 --> 0:50:3,45
if you look at the evidence,
B-level players respond


1193
0:50:3,45 --> 0:50:9,2
way more positively to
gifts that are actually


1194
0:50:9,2 --> 0:50:11,17
given to them.


1195
0:50:11,17 --> 0:50:13,68
So when I say gifts, I'm
not saying buying them off


1196
0:50:13,68 --> 0:50:16,99
with money, doing something
for them that's a surprise


1197
0:50:16,99 --> 0:50:19,26
that they actually value.


1198
0:50:19,26 --> 0:50:21,83
And the reason is, if
you have B-level player,


1199
0:50:21,83 --> 0:50:24,77
you look around in the
market, and you sort of say,


1200
0:50:24,77 --> 0:50:26,7
I'm looking around,
I can't get a job


1201
0:50:26,7 --> 0:50:28,37
like I have in this company.


1202
0:50:28,37 --> 0:50:31,8
Here's a company that's
done something nice for me.


1203
0:50:31,8 --> 0:50:33,9
And it could be as simple
a thing as something


1204
0:50:33,9 --> 0:50:36,16
for their child or
spouse or whatever


1205
0:50:36,16 --> 0:50:38,94
the specific
instantiation is, they're


1206
0:50:38,94 --> 0:50:41,4
actually going to
give you 10x back.


1207
0:50:41,4 --> 0:50:45,1
If I'm an A-level player,
you do something nice for me,


1208
0:50:45,1 --> 0:50:47,64
I'm also going to scan
the talent market,


1209
0:50:47,64 --> 0:50:49,92
and simply say, well
he did it because hey,


1210
0:50:49,92 --> 0:50:51,72
that's the price at attention.


1211
0:50:51,72 --> 0:50:53,78
Otherwise, I'm going
to go someplace else.


1212
0:50:53,78 --> 0:50:56,93
So you actually have
very asymmetric responses


1213
0:50:56,93 --> 0:50:58,15
to gift-giving.


1214
0:50:58,15 --> 0:51:0,23
And what you really
need to understand


1215
0:51:0,23 --> 0:51:2,47
is, what's the gift
that makes the most


1216
0:51:2,47 --> 0:51:5,0
sense for your B-level players?


1217
0:51:5,0 --> 0:51:7,34
And that, I don't have line
of sight to give you more--


1218
0:51:7,34 --> 0:51:10,4
BOB SUTTON: I'm going to say
something more cynical which


1219
0:51:10,4 --> 0:51:13,99
is, we hear about the--
including this one we're


1220
0:51:13,99 --> 0:51:16,1
sitting in now-- the
startups that all make it.


1221
0:51:16,1 --> 0:51:17,15
Most of them die.


1222
0:51:17,15 --> 0:51:18,69
Most of them deserve to die.


1223
0:51:18,69 --> 0:51:21,35
And a lot of the
entrepreneurial game, I'm sorry,


1224
0:51:21,35 --> 0:51:23,11
it's just knowing when
to shoot the thing.


1225
0:51:23,11 --> 0:51:26,77
And venture capitalists,
especially the good ones,


1226
0:51:26,77 --> 0:51:28,46
are really good at that.


1227
0:51:28,46 --> 0:51:31,35
And I don't want to
damn your startup.


1228
0:51:31,35 --> 0:51:35,36
But the typical startup
in Silicon Valley dies.


1229
0:51:35,36 --> 0:51:36,62
And it should die.


1230
0:51:36,62 --> 0:51:39,79
So in the thing to do
is to take that A-player


1231
0:51:39,79 --> 0:51:43,65
and maybe reform with another
set A-players and to go again.


1232
0:51:43,65 --> 0:51:46,49
Because the great thing about
startups is, failure's cheap.


1233
0:51:46,49 --> 0:51:50,39
And most of you who start
firms in Silicon Valley-- this


1234
0:51:50,39 --> 0:51:52,17
is not Detroit-- you
can get another job.


1235
0:51:52,17 --> 0:51:53,63
Most of you are quite talented.


1236
0:51:53,63 --> 0:51:56,95
So my view of startups is, if
things are really screwed up,


1237
0:51:56,95 --> 0:51:59,93
well that's what
pulling the plug is for.


1238
0:51:59,93 --> 0:52:1,87
And quitting is good.


1239
0:52:1,87 --> 0:52:3,43
Never quit-- that's bullshit.


1240
0:52:3,43 --> 0:52:6,55
HUGGY RAO: And
certainly, you don't


1241
0:52:6,55 --> 0:52:9,92
want to escalate commitment to a
losing course of action either.


1242
0:52:9,92 --> 0:52:12,94
BOB SUTTON: That's
what I was saying.


1243
0:52:12,94 --> 0:52:14,825
More fancy language.


1244
0:52:14,825 --> 0:52:16,95
HUGGY RAO: This is the
conversation Bob and I have.


1245
0:52:16,95 --> 0:52:18,824
But usually over
a lot of wine so.


1246
0:52:18,824 --> 0:52:21,24
MALE SPEAKER: So having said
all that, you aren't advising


1247
0:52:21,24 --> 0:52:22,573
people to go to startups, right?


1248
0:52:22,573 --> 0:52:23,222
[LAUGHTER]


1249
0:52:23,222 --> 0:52:26,4
BOB SUTTON: No, no.


1250
0:52:26,4 --> 0:52:27,394
You all know the odds.


1251
0:52:27,394 --> 0:52:28,31
You all know the game.


1252
0:52:28,31 --> 0:52:29,86
So it's just the way it works.


1253
0:52:29,86 --> 0:52:32,21
So you go there, and Google
buys you or they come back,


1254
0:52:32,21 --> 0:52:34,1
you come back as an
employee after it died.


1255
0:52:34,1 --> 0:52:35,44
Either way, it's OK.


1256
0:52:35,44 --> 0:52:38,1
MALE SPEAKER: So do we have time
for a question or two, Cliff,


1257
0:52:38,1 --> 0:52:39,18
or are we set?


1258
0:52:39,18 --> 0:52:40,61
CLIFF: Yes, a final question.


1259
0:52:40,61 --> 0:52:43,11
MALE SPEAKER: Any other audience
question for Bob and Huggy?


1260
0:52:43,11 --> 0:52:47,16



1261
0:52:47,16 --> 0:52:49,61
I had one more, which
doesn't have anything


1262
0:52:49,61 --> 0:52:51,35
to do with the book itself.


1263
0:52:51,35 --> 0:52:53,87
Obviously, both of you
teach at the business school


1264
0:52:53,87 --> 0:52:55,29
at Standford.


1265
0:52:55,29 --> 0:52:57,8
And many Googlers are
interested in going


1266
0:52:57,8 --> 0:53:0,3
to business school
getting their MBAs, right?


1267
0:53:0,3 --> 0:53:6,7
So what's the advice that
you'd give to a Googler who's


1268
0:53:6,7 --> 0:53:8,62
considering business
school, who has


1269
0:53:8,62 --> 0:53:10,66
other things that they could do?


1270
0:53:10,66 --> 0:53:13,32
And this is a question that
we and the people up scheme


1271
0:53:13,32 --> 0:53:15,2
get asked all the time.


1272
0:53:15,2 --> 0:53:18,26
So since we have you, we can
ask the same question of you.


1273
0:53:18,26 --> 0:53:20,58
And by the way, don't
make it too compelling


1274
0:53:20,58 --> 0:53:22,73
because we want these
people to stay here.


1275
0:53:22,73 --> 0:53:25,386
HUGGY RAO: So Bob why
don't you actually be--


1276
0:53:25,386 --> 0:53:27,76
BOB SUTTON: I don't teach in
a business school, remember.


1277
0:53:27,76 --> 0:53:29,67
I'm an engineering
professor, so therefore, I


1278
0:53:29,67 --> 0:53:31,42
am free to be cynical.


1279
0:53:31,42 --> 0:53:33,78
Our friend Jeff
Pfeffer would tell you


1280
0:53:33,78 --> 0:53:37,4
that, if you're interested
actually in lifetime income,


1281
0:53:37,4 --> 0:53:40,269
that you should only go to a top
eight-- in addition to the fact


1282
0:53:40,269 --> 0:53:42,81
that it's a great vacation, and
all sorts of wonderful things


1283
0:53:42,81 --> 0:53:44,55
happen in business school.


1284
0:53:44,55 --> 0:53:48,251
But you should only go to a top
eight or ten business school.


1285
0:53:48,251 --> 0:53:49,626
Because other than
that it's just


1286
0:53:49,626 --> 0:53:50,83
going to take two
years of your life


1287
0:53:50,83 --> 0:53:52,72
and lower your lifetime income,
and there's very good evidence


1288
0:53:52,72 --> 0:53:53,85
to support this.


1289
0:53:53,85 --> 0:53:57,704
So I want to play the,
sort of, Jeff Pfeffer card.


1290
0:53:57,704 --> 0:53:59,87
But one thing I will say
about the Stanford Business


1291
0:53:59,87 --> 0:54:2,64
School, where I don't
teach, because I'm


1292
0:54:2,64 --> 0:54:6,31
a tenured engineering professor,
is that-- as my understanding--


1293
0:54:6,31 --> 0:54:7,847
is that if you go
to Stanford, it's


1294
0:54:7,847 --> 0:54:9,43
actually a really
good financial deal.


1295
0:54:9,43 --> 0:54:12,7
That on average, you're going
to come out ahead financially.


1296
0:54:12,7 --> 0:54:14,836
And culturally, that's
sort of up to you.


1297
0:54:14,836 --> 0:54:16,71
The final thing I would
say though, since I'm


1298
0:54:16,71 --> 0:54:18,71
from an engineering school
and I'm not engineer,


1299
0:54:18,71 --> 0:54:20,53
is we all know that
the characteristic


1300
0:54:20,53 --> 0:54:23,9
of the current boom is
it's much, much less


1301
0:54:23,9 --> 0:54:27,296
MBA-centric, and
much, much-- you


1302
0:54:27,296 --> 0:54:28,87
know this much
better than I do--


1303
0:54:28,87 --> 0:54:31,31
and much, much more
engineering-centric.


1304
0:54:31,31 --> 0:54:33,66
So it's the engineers'
days, and we're


1305
0:54:33,66 --> 0:54:35,227
winning, even on an engineer.


1306
0:54:35,227 --> 0:54:37,91
HUGGY RAO: So one other
thing to keep in mind


1307
0:54:37,91 --> 0:54:43,2
is, business schools are
changing dramatically too,


1308
0:54:43,2 --> 0:54:46,2
so you don't think of the
MBA as a standalone degree.


1309
0:54:46,2 --> 0:54:48,96
In fact, we have a number of
programs where you actually


1310
0:54:48,96 --> 0:54:51,12
have an MBA, you can
also get a masters


1311
0:54:51,12 --> 0:54:53,17
in computer science and
electrical engineering,


1312
0:54:53,17 --> 0:54:56,17
just to name a few.


1313
0:54:56,17 --> 0:54:59,9
So there are lots of
options and combinations.


1314
0:54:59,9 --> 0:55:2,24
Our experience certainly at
the Stanford Business School


1315
0:55:2,24 --> 0:55:6,11
is, pretty much, the kinds
of people who actually come,


1316
0:55:6,11 --> 0:55:10,45
they're overwhelmingly tilted
towards a startup option.


1317
0:55:10,45 --> 0:55:14,23
By the end of year one, they've
already figured out an idea.


1318
0:55:14,23 --> 0:55:15,41
They're working.


1319
0:55:15,41 --> 0:55:17,2
They're trying to do things.


1320
0:55:17,2 --> 0:55:19,62
And as a matter of fact,
right before I came here,


1321
0:55:19,62 --> 0:55:23,74
I was actually teaching a course
along with a finance professor


1322
0:55:23,74 --> 0:55:26,725
and a marketing professor,
a course called "From Launch


1323
0:55:26,725 --> 0:55:28,14
to Liquidity."


1324
0:55:28,14 --> 0:55:30,58
Once you start a venture,
how do you actually


1325
0:55:30,58 --> 0:55:31,93
think of your exit?


1326
0:55:31,93 --> 0:55:34,37
And I can certainly
tell you, our students


1327
0:55:34,37 --> 0:55:36,87
believe in very liquid futures.


1328
0:55:36,87 --> 0:55:38,67
or at least, they kind
of anticipate that.


1329
0:55:38,67 --> 0:55:39,69
BOB SUTTON: See,
I don't even know


1330
0:55:39,69 --> 0:55:41,41
how he was teaching this,
since I'm very focused.


1331
0:55:41,41 --> 0:55:43,784
The course we teach in the
engineering school, especially


1332
0:55:43,784 --> 0:55:45,71
the design school, we
wouldn't talk about it.


1333
0:55:45,71 --> 0:55:47,25
We have a class
called "Launch Pad."


1334
0:55:47,25 --> 0:55:49,5
We put you in it, and
you'd start your company.


1335
0:55:49,5 --> 0:55:51,25
And so there's a class
called "Launch Pad"


1336
0:55:51,25 --> 0:55:52,54
taught by Michael
Dearing and Perry


1337
0:55:52,54 --> 0:55:54,49
Klebahn, both who are
successful entrepreneurs


1338
0:55:54,49 --> 0:55:55,41
in their own right.


1339
0:55:55,41 --> 0:55:58,152
Although Michael did fail
in a big shoe operation.


1340
0:55:58,152 --> 0:55:59,86
If you don't have a
product by week four,


1341
0:55:59,86 --> 0:56:1,45
you're supposed
to be thrown out.


1342
0:56:1,45 --> 0:56:2,332
So little--


1343
0:56:2,332 --> 0:56:3,79
HUGGY RAO: A number
of our students


1344
0:56:3,79 --> 0:56:5,1
actually do take that course--


1345
0:56:5,1 --> 0:56:6,46
BOB SUTTON: You can take that
as well in the business school.


1346
0:56:6,46 --> 0:56:9,82
HUGGY RAO: So you have the
whole, sort of, university.


1347
0:56:9,82 --> 0:56:11,11
But just to give underscore.


1348
0:56:11,11 --> 0:56:15,65
Bob's point about how
attractive this is as an option.


1349
0:56:15,65 --> 0:56:17,852
Once when I was
teaching a class,


1350
0:56:17,852 --> 0:56:21,7
there was a young lady who
got up and told everybody


1351
0:56:21,7 --> 0:56:23,222
in the class, hey, I
have a proposal for you.


1352
0:56:23,222 --> 0:56:24,93
And she looked at me
and said, professor,


1353
0:56:24,93 --> 0:56:26,5
can I make the proposal?


1354
0:56:26,5 --> 0:56:26,98
I said, sure.


1355
0:56:26,98 --> 0:56:29,82
She looked at 80 kids
in the class and said,


1356
0:56:29,82 --> 0:56:33,87
I'm actually going to give
you $250,000 right now.


1357
0:56:33,87 --> 0:56:38,78
In return, I want 2% of
your lifetime earnings.


1358
0:56:38,78 --> 0:56:42,32
what do you think was the
response of those 80 people?


1359
0:56:42,32 --> 0:56:44,93
Mull over that,
and that's where we


1360
0:56:44,93 --> 0:56:47,88
ought to appropriately
close on a puzzle.


1361
0:56:47,88 --> 0:56:49,63
BOB SUTTON: That's
like a Google interview


1362
0:56:49,63 --> 0:56:51,25
question, the old ones.


1363
0:56:51,25 --> 0:56:52,25
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you.


1364
0:56:52,25 --> 0:56:54,39
Thank you Bob and Huggy
for coming over and sharing


1365
0:56:54,39 --> 0:56:56,6
all of your insights on scaling.


1366
0:56:56,6 --> 0:56:58,747
Again, the book is called
"Scaling Up Excellence."


1367
0:56:58,747 --> 0:57:0,33
BOB SUTTON: Thanks
for your questions.


1368
0:57:0,33 --> 0:57:1,49
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah,
thank you for questions,


1369
0:57:1,49 --> 0:57:4,23
and we have copies of the
book in the back, as well.


1370
0:57:4,23 --> 0:57:7,434
So, with that, lets give a
warm round to Bob and Huggy.


1371
0:57:7,434 --> 0:57:8,35
BOB SUTTON: Thank you.


1372
0:57:8,35 --> 0:57:9,641
HUGGY RAO: Thank you very much.


1373
0:57:9,641 --> 0:59:9,641
