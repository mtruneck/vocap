1
0:0:3,688 --> 0:0:6,124
- The pole was 50 feet away.


2
0:0:6,124 --> 0:0:8,86
- And by "50" you mean "2," right?


3
0:0:8,86 --> 0:0:10,562
- Mom, I wasn't gonna hit it.


4
0:0:10,562 --> 0:0:12,3
- Then, it was gonna hit you.


5
0:0:12,3 --> 0:0:15,66
Lindsey, just because the car
has a high safety ranking


6
0:0:15,66 --> 0:0:16,501
doesn't mean you should drive crazy


7
0:0:16,501 --> 0:0:22,707
To see if they're telling the truth.


8
0:0:22,707 --> 0:0:24,609
- You gonna tell me how
to close the door too?


9
0:0:24,609 --> 0:0:27,145
- No. Since you already used
the parking assist


10
0:0:27,145 --> 0:0:28,813
to back up safely into the driveway


11
0:0:28,813 --> 0:0:30,615
and managed not to hit the house,


12
0:0:30,615 --> 0:0:34,285
I think you can close the door
on your own.


13
0:0:34,285 --> 0:0:35,587
- How was that?


14
0:0:35,587 --> 0:0:40,425
- Fine.


15
0:0:40,425 --> 0:0:41,993
- It's okay, baby.


16
0:0:41,993 --> 0:0:44,62
I won't let her hurt you.


17
0:0:44,62 --> 0:0:46,97
I know you're safe
for the environment,


18
0:0:46,97 --> 0:0:47,565
and I'm going to make sure


19
0:0:47,565 --> 0:0:51,336
That the environment is safe for you.


20
0:0:51,336 --> 0:0:52,871
What are you looking at?


21
0:0:52,871 --> 0:0:55,94
Mind your business!


22
0:0:55,94 --> 0:1:2,46
Nosy.


23
0:1:2,46 --> 0:1:4,949
- Hey. How'd the driving lesson go?


24
0:1:4,949 --> 0:1:7,152
- What did Lindsey say?


25
0:1:7,152 --> 0:1:8,386
- Nothing.


26
0:1:8,386 --> 0:1:9,454
- Mm-Hmm.


27
0:1:9,454 --> 0:1:11,156
Did she tell you
she almost hit a pole,


28
0:1:11,156 --> 0:1:13,358
came this close
to running a red light,


29
0:1:13,358 --> 0:1:15,627
made a left-hand turn
from the right Lane,


30
0:1:15,627 --> 0:1:16,895
And cut off a cop?


31
0:1:16,895 --> 0:1:19,164
If it weren't for
the star safety system,


32
0:1:19,164 --> 0:1:22,801
we would have rear-ended
somebody at chicken on a stick.


33
0:1:22,801 --> 0:1:24,35
- What are you looking at?


34
0:1:24,35 --> 0:1:26,7
- Nothing.


35
0:1:26,7 --> 0:1:27,605
- Um.


36
0:1:27,605 --> 0:1:30,975
Huh. Not good, huh?


37
0:1:30,975 --> 0:1:34,112
- Nick, all white women
were giving her the finger.


38
0:1:34,112 --> 0:1:35,647
- Oh, are you okay?


39
0:1:35,647 --> 0:1:37,48
- I'm fine.


40
0:1:37,48 --> 0:1:38,65
It was just a bit much, you know,


41
0:1:38,65 --> 0:1:40,552
and I spent most of the day
trying to plan


42
0:1:40,552 --> 0:1:42,32
that rich girl's sweet 16 party.


43
0:1:42,32 --> 0:1:44,856
- Oh, at that solar-powered
house at the waterfront.


44
0:1:44,856 --> 0:1:46,958
- Yeah, because she wants
a green party.


45
0:1:46,958 --> 0:1:48,626
- Oh, it's green, all right.


46
0:1:48,626 --> 0:1:50,94
- Oh, and get this.


47
0:1:50,94 --> 0:1:52,831
Her parents are now buying her
a brand-new prius,


48
0:1:52,831 --> 0:1:55,967
custom green, and they want me
to get Katy Perry


49
0:1:55,967 --> 0:1:57,302
To sing <i>Happy Birthday.</i>


50
0:1:57,302 --> 0:2:0,138
The whole party is so they can
impress other parents.


51
0:2:0,138 --> 0:2:3,942
<i>for Ashley's birthday,
we rented Katy Perry</i>.


52
0:2:3,942 --> 0:2:6,211
You know what I got
for my 16th birthday?


53
0:2:6,211 --> 0:2:8,847
A leather eight-ball jacket
and a clean version


54
0:2:8,847 --> 0:2:10,448
of <i>straight outta Compton.</i>


55
0:2:10,448 --> 0:2:13,117
- Hmm. Man.


56
0:2:13,117 --> 0:2:15,286
Sounds like you got a lot
on your plate, babe.


57
0:2:15,286 --> 0:2:16,821
Aw.


58
0:2:16,821 --> 0:2:18,523
You got one girl driving you crazy,


59
0:2:18,523 --> 0:2:20,992
another girl driving crazy.


60
0:2:20,992 --> 0:2:23,127
If you hadn't lost your mind already,


61
0:2:23,127 --> 0:2:25,997
we'd really be in trouble.


62
0:2:25,997 --> 0:2:27,966
Well, you know what,
since you're so concerned


63
0:2:27,966 --> 0:2:31,769
with my health and well being,
you teach Lindsey to drive.


64
0:2:31,769 --> 0:2:33,638
- I ain't scared of that girl.


65
0:2:33,638 --> 0:2:35,406
- You may not have any hair
on your head,


66
0:2:35,406 --> 0:2:37,609
but I'll bet she can turn
your eyebrows gray.


67
0:2:37,609 --> 0:2:47,51
- Pssht.


68
0:2:47,51 --> 0:2:48,686
- Are we there yet?


69
0:2:48,686 --> 0:2:54,425
sync and correct by dr.jackson
www.addic7ed.com


70
0:2:54,425 --> 0:2:56,528
Okay, Lindsey.


71
0:2:56,528 --> 0:2:59,63
Do you have your checklist memorized?


72
0:2:59,63 --> 0:3:0,64
- Yes, dad.


73
0:3:0,64 --> 0:3:2,667
- All right, well, let's hear it.


74
0:3:2,667 --> 0:3:5,303
- When I am driving,
there is no eating,


75
0:3:5,303 --> 0:3:7,972
no drinking, no makeup, no texting...


76
0:3:7,972 --> 0:3:9,474
- Especially no texts.


77
0:3:9,474 --> 0:3:11,843
As a matter of fact,
every time you get in the car,


78
0:3:11,843 --> 0:3:13,144
Where should your phone be?


79
0:3:13,144 --> 0:3:14,379
- In the glove compartment.


80
0:3:14,379 --> 0:3:16,548
- That's right.
And when you take a call?


81
0:3:16,548 --> 0:3:17,582
- Use my Bluetooth.


82
0:3:17,582 --> 0:3:19,317
- Make a call?
- Pull over...


83
0:3:19,317 --> 0:3:22,22
- No. Turn on your blinker,
look in your mirrors,


84
0:3:22,22 --> 0:3:25,123
and <i>safely</i> pull over.


85
0:3:25,123 --> 0:3:26,558
- Right. Do all that, then pull over


86
0:3:26,558 --> 0:3:27,725
And turn the car off.


87
0:3:27,725 --> 0:3:28,96
- All right.


88
0:3:28,96 --> 0:3:31,95
It seems like you've been listening.


89
0:3:31,95 --> 0:3:33,932
Check, check. Check, check, check.


90
0:3:33,932 --> 0:3:36,467
And check. Good job.


91
0:3:36,467 --> 0:3:38,57
- I'm checking my mirrors to be sure


92
0:3:38,57 --> 0:3:39,938
it is safe to proceed.


93
0:3:39,938 --> 0:3:41,773
- Why are you checking mirrors?


94
0:3:41,773 --> 0:3:43,708
The street is right in front of you.


95
0:3:43,708 --> 0:3:47,812
- oh.


96
0:3:47,812 --> 0:3:50,648
- No radio, no singing,
no humming, no head bobbing,


97
0:3:50,648 --> 0:3:52,65
no finger snapping, no finger tapping,


98
0:3:52,65 --> 0:3:55,32
no head nodding, no lip-synching.


99
0:3:55,32 --> 0:3:56,854
Shouldn't you be writing this down?


100
0:3:56,854 --> 0:4:0,325
- Mom!


101
0:4:0,325 --> 0:4:3,261
- Oh, absolutely, Ashley.


102
0:4:3,261 --> 0:4:4,495
oh...


103
0:4:4,495 --> 0:4:7,999
O.M.G., Ashley.


104
0:4:7,999 --> 0:4:9,867
Okay. Okay.


105
0:4:9,867 --> 0:4:12,136
Okay, bye-bye.


106
0:4:12,136 --> 0:4:14,672
Now after they cut the birthday cake,


107
0:4:14,672 --> 0:4:17,141
they want fireworks.


108
0:4:17,141 --> 0:4:20,11
- If they wanted real fireworks,
they could just cancel the party


109
0:4:20,11 --> 0:4:26,818
and watch the girl explode.


110
0:4:26,818 --> 0:4:29,187
- Hi, Ashley.


111
0:4:29,187 --> 0:4:31,956
Oh, a white tiger,
and you want to ride it.


112
0:4:31,956 --> 0:4:32,924
Okay.


113
0:4:32,924 --> 0:4:34,726
- Kevin.
- Yeah?


114
0:4:34,726 --> 0:4:37,462
- Where are you going
with that giant bottle of soda?


115
0:4:37,462 --> 0:4:40,131
- It's for my science project.
I'm building a rocket.


116
0:4:40,131 --> 0:4:42,9
All I need is this
and a pack of mentos.


117
0:4:42,9 --> 0:4:48,406
- Kevin, building a rocket
is too easy and unoriginal.


118
0:4:48,406 --> 0:4:49,907
Now, I'm not gonna have
you get shown up


119
0:4:49,907 --> 0:4:51,309
by those other kids in your class


120
0:4:51,309 --> 0:4:52,644
like you did last year.


121
0:4:52,644 --> 0:4:54,612
So this year, you're going to build


122
0:4:54,612 --> 0:4:57,849
Something original
that no one else will have:


123
0:4:57,849 --> 0:5:0,518
a solar-powered house.


124
0:5:0,518 --> 0:5:1,819
- What? Mom!


125
0:5:1,819 --> 0:5:4,55
What's so original about
a solar-powered house?


126
0:5:4,55 --> 0:5:5,723
Everybody's got a house.


127
0:5:5,723 --> 0:5:7,825
Who do you know who has a rocket?


128
0:5:7,825 --> 0:5:9,994
- Well, I can tell you
who's not going to have one.


129
0:5:9,994 --> 0:5:13,64
Kevin, last year, you got a "d"
on your science project.


130
0:5:13,64 --> 0:5:14,532
Now, it wasn't your fault,


131
0:5:14,532 --> 0:5:16,934
because all the other kids
had help with their projects.


132
0:5:16,934 --> 0:5:20,638
So this year, I'm helping you,
and we, meaning you,


133
0:5:20,638 --> 0:5:23,174
are building a solar-powered house.


134
0:5:23,174 --> 0:5:25,777
- Can it be the House of a guy
who has a rocket?


135
0:5:25,777 --> 0:5:27,145
- Sure.
- Yes!


136
0:5:27,145 --> 0:5:28,79
- Yeah!


137
0:5:28,79 --> 0:5:34,252
Uhh.
- Uhh.


138
0:5:34,252 --> 0:5:36,887
- wow. Lindsey.


139
0:5:36,887 --> 0:5:37,955
Nice work.


140
0:5:37,955 --> 0:5:39,357
- Check.


141
0:5:39,357 --> 0:5:41,826
- Sounds like the driving lesson
was a success.


142
0:5:41,826 --> 0:5:44,95
- Dad is awesome.


143
0:5:44,95 --> 0:5:46,43
- Check.


144
0:5:46,43 --> 0:5:49,3
All it took was just
a little bit of patience.


145
0:5:49,3 --> 0:5:50,368
- Mm-Hmm.


146
0:5:50,368 --> 0:5:52,37
Nick, I can't stand you.


147
0:5:52,37 --> 0:5:54,705
You mean to tell me you spent
three hours in the car


148
0:5:54,705 --> 0:5:56,474
with that girl
and didn't have a problem?


149
0:5:56,474 --> 0:5:57,942
- Nope.
- Nothing?


150
0:5:57,942 --> 0:5:59,61
- Nada.
- Serious?


151
0:5:59,61 --> 0:6:2,113
- All right, we may have went
the wrong way


152
0:6:2,113 --> 0:6:5,616
down a one-way street,
but other than that...


153
0:6:5,616 --> 0:6:6,617
What's this?


154
0:6:6,617 --> 0:6:7,818
- Kevin's science project.


155
0:6:7,818 --> 0:6:8,986
I'm helping him.


156
0:6:8,986 --> 0:6:10,821
We're building a solar-powered house.


157
0:6:10,821 --> 0:6:12,59
- I thought he wanted
to build a rocket.


158
0:6:12,59 --> 0:6:13,724
- I do.


159
0:6:13,724 --> 0:6:19,53
- Be quiet!


160
0:6:19,53 --> 0:6:21,732
- Hey.


161
0:6:21,732 --> 0:6:24,201
- Hey. How's it going with Ashley?


162
0:6:24,201 --> 0:6:26,504
- Don't ask.


163
0:6:26,504 --> 0:6:28,673
What's all this?


164
0:6:28,673 --> 0:6:29,874
- Kevin's science project.


165
0:6:29,874 --> 0:6:32,243
We're building a solar-powered house.


166
0:6:32,243 --> 0:6:33,577
- Stupid question.


167
0:6:33,577 --> 0:6:34,879
- Won't be the first.


168
0:6:34,879 --> 0:6:36,213
- But I always wondered...


169
0:6:36,213 --> 0:6:38,549
What happens at night?


170
0:6:38,549 --> 0:6:39,617
- Huh?


171
0:6:39,617 --> 0:6:41,852
okay, miss energy efficient.


172
0:6:41,852 --> 0:6:43,354
You didn't think about that, did you?


173
0:6:43,354 --> 0:6:45,656
Now, y'all figure that out,
you come and then you talk to me


174
0:6:45,656 --> 0:6:47,91
about a solar house.


175
0:6:47,91 --> 0:6:52,963
But until then, I'm sticking
with the wall plugs.


176
0:6:52,963 --> 0:6:54,799
- Ashley?
- Mm-Hmm.


177
0:6:54,799 --> 0:6:58,235
Now she wants a red carpet
for her V.I.P. Arrivals.


178
0:6:58,235 --> 0:7:0,671
- Somebody should tell her she's 16.


179
0:7:0,671 --> 0:7:6,444
Nobody important is at her party.


180
0:7:6,444 --> 0:7:8,346
- I'm hungry.


181
0:7:8,346 --> 0:7:14,185
- Do you want a cracker?


182
0:7:14,185 --> 0:7:15,486
- Mmm.


183
0:7:15,486 --> 0:7:17,288
- Why does she keep calling?


184
0:7:17,288 --> 0:7:19,19
- She's in her car.


185
0:7:19,19 --> 0:7:20,691
- Gigi.


186
0:7:20,691 --> 0:7:30,34
- Gotta go.


187
0:7:30,34 --> 0:7:31,936
- Kevin.
- Yeah?


188
0:7:31,936 --> 0:7:33,838
- Why are you using my good glue?


189
0:7:33,838 --> 0:7:36,14
- I'm building a launch tower
for my rocket.


190
0:7:36,14 --> 0:7:37,408
- I said he had a rocket.


191
0:7:37,408 --> 0:7:39,944
I didn't say he had it
in his backyard.


192
0:7:39,944 --> 0:7:41,612
- So no launch tower?


193
0:7:41,612 --> 0:7:43,13
- Your launch has been postponed.


194
0:7:43,13 --> 0:7:50,755
Go upstairs.


195
0:7:50,755 --> 0:7:52,556
- Hey, sleepy.


196
0:7:52,556 --> 0:7:54,291
- Hi.


197
0:7:54,291 --> 0:7:55,493
Where were you?


198
0:7:55,493 --> 0:7:56,694
- A little coffee run.


199
0:7:56,694 --> 0:7:58,662
Plus I gassed up your car
and got it washed.


200
0:7:58,662 --> 0:8:1,432
You were still knocked out
when I left.


201
0:8:1,432 --> 0:8:3,834
What were you doing up
so late last night?


202
0:8:3,834 --> 0:8:6,36
- Working on Kevin's project.


203
0:8:6,36 --> 0:8:9,64
I didn't come to bed till almost 2:00.


204
0:8:9,64 --> 0:8:12,343
I had no idea how much work goes
into building


205
0:8:12,343 --> 0:8:14,311
a solar-powered house.


206
0:8:14,311 --> 0:8:15,646
- You're not supposed to.


207
0:8:15,646 --> 0:8:19,183
Maybe you should let Kevin work
on his own project.


208
0:8:19,183 --> 0:8:21,619
- Well, none of those other kids
are working on their projects,


209
0:8:21,619 --> 0:8:24,588
And I'm not gonna let him walk
in with some funky old rocket


210
0:8:24,588 --> 0:8:26,257
When all these other kids
are showing up


211
0:8:26,257 --> 0:8:28,893
with nuclear reactors
made out of Popsicle sticks


212
0:8:28,893 --> 0:8:30,761
and nuclear reactor parts.


213
0:8:30,761 --> 0:8:32,53
- Somebody had that?


214
0:8:32,53 --> 0:8:33,597
- No, I'm just saying.


215
0:8:33,597 --> 0:8:36,767
- Baby, isn't the point of the project


216
0:8:36,767 --> 0:8:40,471
To let the kid work
and learn something?


217
0:8:40,471 --> 0:8:42,506
- Who are you,
Bill Nye the science guy?


218
0:8:42,506 --> 0:8:46,1
No. The point of the project
is to get an "a."


219
0:8:46,1 --> 0:8:48,412
And when those other parents
let their kids learn something,


220
0:8:48,412 --> 0:8:49,947
then I'll let my kid learn something.


221
0:8:49,947 --> 0:8:51,81
But in the meantime,


222
0:8:51,81 --> 0:8:54,51
we all just gonna have to be
stupid together.


223
0:8:54,51 --> 0:8:55,219
What?


224
0:8:55,219 --> 0:9:3,461
- Nothing.


225
0:9:3,461 --> 0:9:8,365
- Mom. Mommy.


226
0:9:8,365 --> 0:9:9,667
- Can you move the car?


227
0:9:9,667 --> 0:9:11,469
- What are you doing?
Don't wake her up.


228
0:9:11,469 --> 0:9:16,574
- What?
- Come on.


229
0:9:16,574 --> 0:9:19,443
- I want to skateboard,
but mom's car's in the driveway.


230
0:9:19,443 --> 0:9:20,444
- Fine, I'll move it.


231
0:9:20,444 --> 0:9:21,445
- You can't drive.


232
0:9:21,445 --> 0:9:22,88
- Do you want to skateboard or not?


233
0:9:22,88 --> 0:9:25,216
- Skateboard.


234
0:9:25,216 --> 0:9:27,318
- Come on.
- Uh-uh.


235
0:9:27,318 --> 0:9:30,688
I'll come out
once you're out of that car.


236
0:9:30,688 --> 0:9:36,594
You need my helmet?
- Nope.


237
0:9:36,594 --> 0:9:41,665
- Nick!


238
0:9:41,665 --> 0:9:44,702
Gigi, are you sure
you don't know what happened?


239
0:9:44,702 --> 0:9:47,771
- Suzanne, I drove around the block


240
0:9:47,771 --> 0:9:49,573
while you picked up the box.


241
0:9:49,573 --> 0:9:52,276
If something happened, I'd noticed!


242
0:9:52,276 --> 0:9:54,378
- Well, somebody around here
better know something,


243
0:9:54,378 --> 0:9:56,38
because I'm about ready to explode!


244
0:9:56,38 --> 0:9:57,815
- What's up?


245
0:9:57,815 --> 0:10:5,495
- Why is there a dent in my car?


246
0:10:5,495 --> 0:10:8,31
- Well, I don't know how it happened,


247
0:10:8,31 --> 0:10:11,0
But I know one thing, I didn't do it.


248
0:10:11,0 --> 0:10:13,503
- Well, you're the only
other one who drove it.


249
0:10:13,503 --> 0:10:15,204
- That doesn't mean I dented it.


250
0:10:15,204 --> 0:10:17,106
- Yeah, it kind of does.


251
0:10:17,106 --> 0:10:18,975
- The only people who drove the car


252
0:10:18,975 --> 0:10:21,77
Besides me and Gigi
was you and Lindsey.


253
0:10:21,77 --> 0:10:22,545
She didn't do it when she was with me,


254
0:10:22,545 --> 0:10:24,18
and she didn't do it
when she was with you.


255
0:10:24,18 --> 0:10:25,114
Did she?


256
0:10:25,114 --> 0:10:27,16
- No.
- Well, all right, then.


257
0:10:27,16 --> 0:10:30,587
- All right, then, what?
- Who did it?


258
0:10:30,587 --> 0:10:33,89
- Maybe you dented it,
and you didn't realize it.


259
0:10:33,89 --> 0:10:36,225
- Nick, I think I would know
if I dented my car.


260
0:10:36,225 --> 0:10:38,428
- What about the time you d...
- Aren't you hungry?


261
0:10:38,428 --> 0:10:39,529
- Uh, yes.


262
0:10:39,529 --> 0:10:45,602
Yes, I am hungry.


263
0:10:45,602 --> 0:10:47,203
- Okay, let's go through it again.


264
0:10:47,203 --> 0:10:50,139
So you went to get coffee
this morning...


265
0:10:50,139 --> 0:10:51,341
- Right.


266
0:10:51,341 --> 0:10:53,543
- And you went to the car wash.


267
0:10:53,543 --> 0:10:55,144
- Right.


268
0:10:55,144 --> 0:10:57,146
- Wait! That's it!


269
0:10:57,146 --> 0:10:58,348
- You dented it at the car wash?


270
0:10:58,348 --> 0:10:59,449
- No.


271
0:10:59,449 --> 0:11:1,117
The reason I went to the car wash


272
0:11:1,117 --> 0:11:3,319
Is because I got a free coupon
when I valeted


273
0:11:3,319 --> 0:11:5,54
At the restaurant last night.


274
0:11:5,54 --> 0:11:7,457
- Great. So...Now what?


275
0:11:7,457 --> 0:11:8,458
- I'm going down there.


276
0:11:8,458 --> 0:11:9,826
They're gonna pay for that dent.


277
0:11:9,826 --> 0:11:11,661
oh. Yeah. That'll happen.


278
0:11:11,661 --> 0:11:15,999
Right after Jessica alba starts
responding to my emails.


279
0:11:15,999 --> 0:11:18,267
You know that little ticket
they give you at the valet?


280
0:11:18,267 --> 0:11:19,769
- Yeah, so?


281
0:11:19,769 --> 0:11:22,205
- Well, it indemnifies them
against anything and everything


282
0:11:22,205 --> 0:11:24,4
That happens to the car
while in their position


283
0:11:24,4 --> 0:11:26,676
Including but not limited
to them stealing


284
0:11:26,676 --> 0:11:29,879
All your possessions
and lighting the car on fire.


285
0:11:29,879 --> 0:11:32,15
Technically speaking,
they don't even need to park it.


286
0:11:32,15 --> 0:11:34,217
They can just leave your car
in the middle of the street.


287
0:11:34,217 --> 0:11:35,418
- Well, how do you know all that?


288
0:11:35,418 --> 0:11:36,886
- Because one time, they left my car


289
0:11:36,886 --> 0:11:38,121
In the middle of the street.


290
0:11:38,121 --> 0:11:39,555
- Well, all I know is,


291
0:11:39,555 --> 0:11:41,19
Somebody's about to pay for something.


292
0:11:41,19 --> 0:11:48,665
- Said the waitress to
a certain professional golfer.


293
0:11:48,665 --> 0:11:53,136
- Kevin, be very, very careful
with this.


294
0:11:53,136 --> 0:11:55,4
- Mom, if you keep telling me
to be careful,


295
0:11:55,4 --> 0:11:57,73
I'm gonna get nervous and drop it.


296
0:11:57,73 --> 0:12:0,176
- Okay, get nervous and drop it.


297
0:12:0,176 --> 0:12:1,344
- Mom!
- All right, all right.


298
0:12:1,344 --> 0:12:3,112
Good luck.


299
0:12:3,112 --> 0:12:4,347
I love you.


300
0:12:4,347 --> 0:12:5,682
- Bye, mommy.
- Bye.


301
0:12:5,682 --> 0:12:8,618
Oh, and don't forget
to tell them to look inside


302
0:12:8,618 --> 0:12:10,353
so they can see
the photoshopped family


303
0:12:10,353 --> 0:12:13,423
and the miniature couch
and the solar-powered pet.


304
0:12:13,423 --> 0:12:18,461
Eek! So cute.


305
0:12:18,461 --> 0:12:20,53
- We didn't dent your precious prius.


306
0:12:20,53 --> 0:12:22,932
- Look, maybe you did it
and you didn't realize it.


307
0:12:22,932 --> 0:12:24,33
That's all.


308
0:12:24,33 --> 0:12:25,702
- We didn't, and even if we did,


309
0:12:25,702 --> 0:12:27,704
it's not our responsibility.


310
0:12:27,704 --> 0:12:29,205
It says in our policy


311
0:12:29,205 --> 0:12:30,873
That we're not responsible
for anything.


312
0:12:30,873 --> 0:12:32,975
If I leave your car
in the middle of the street,


313
0:12:32,975 --> 0:12:34,51
Guess what, it's not our fault.


314
0:12:34,51 --> 0:12:35,878
It's a contract.


315
0:12:35,878 --> 0:12:37,613
- No, no, no. That is not a contract.


316
0:12:37,613 --> 0:12:38,915
That is a claim ticket, man.


317
0:12:38,915 --> 0:12:40,149
What are you talking about?


318
0:12:40,149 --> 0:12:41,217
- It's a contract.


319
0:12:41,217 --> 0:12:43,553
Prince the musician,
he never parks here


320
0:12:43,553 --> 0:12:44,687
Because he hates contract.


321
0:12:44,687 --> 0:12:47,56
You want to be like him,
it's all good.


322
0:12:47,56 --> 0:12:48,591
Okay, but listen to me.


323
0:12:48,591 --> 0:12:50,96
It's accepting this
and leaving your car with us,


324
0:12:50,96 --> 0:12:52,795
You have accepted this a contract.


325
0:12:52,795 --> 0:12:54,363
You're lucky to even have
your car back.


326
0:12:54,363 --> 0:12:56,699
- Look, nobody reads
these things, man.


327
0:12:56,699 --> 0:12:57,8
- Whose fault is that?


328
0:12:57,8 --> 0:12:59,602
I'm sorry.


329
0:12:59,602 --> 0:13:1,871
Next time you come,
we'll park your car for free...


330
0:13:1,871 --> 0:13:5,74
Only if I remember this conversation


331
0:13:5,74 --> 0:13:7,543
And you wear the same outfit.


332
0:13:7,543 --> 0:13:9,45
You look the same, I look the same,


333
0:13:9,45 --> 0:13:10,58
We can shake to it right now.


334
0:13:10,58 --> 0:13:12,849
- Dog, dog, you did not spit
in your hand


335
0:13:12,849 --> 0:13:13,85
And put that near me.


336
0:13:13,85 --> 0:13:14,984
Put your hand back in there.


337
0:13:14,984 --> 0:13:16,486
Look, I don't know how they do things


338
0:13:16,486 --> 0:13:17,887
In Madagascar, where you from,


339
0:13:17,887 --> 0:13:19,355
But I'm gonna tell you here right now.


340
0:13:19,355 --> 0:13:21,57
I'm gonna tell you
how this runs, brother.


341
0:13:21,57 --> 0:13:22,992
Talking about some free parking?
Free parking?


342
0:13:22,992 --> 0:13:24,46
Do you know how much my car cost?


343
0:13:24,46 --> 0:13:26,129
This is how this is about to run.


344
0:13:26,129 --> 0:13:28,64
You are gonna pay to get my car fixed.


345
0:13:28,64 --> 0:13:29,398
- Or what?


346
0:13:29,398 --> 0:13:32,769
- You know what's gonna happen
if you don't?


347
0:13:32,769 --> 0:13:35,838
I will never come
to this restaurant again.


348
0:13:35,838 --> 0:13:38,641
- You're never gonna come here?


349
0:13:38,641 --> 0:13:39,942
You know you are cheating yourself.


350
0:13:39,942 --> 0:13:41,911
The food is fantastic.
It's the best you ever had.


351
0:13:41,911 --> 0:13:43,45
- I'm not missing the food.


352
0:13:43,45 --> 0:13:44,547
I don't care about the food anymore.


353
0:13:44,547 --> 0:13:45,715
I liked it. I admit.


354
0:13:45,715 --> 0:13:47,45
I loved the food in the past.
- Okay.


355
0:13:47,45 --> 0:13:48,918
- But you know what,
this is over, man.


356
0:13:48,918 --> 0:13:51,53
This ruined the whole food
experience for me.


357
0:13:51,53 --> 0:13:52,288
You wrecked my car.


358
0:13:52,288 --> 0:13:53,489
- I will never see you again.


359
0:13:53,489 --> 0:13:54,457
- You'll never see me.


360
0:13:54,457 --> 0:13:55,992
- I'll never see that sweater again.


361
0:13:55,992 --> 0:13:57,36
You promise me?


362
0:13:57,36 --> 0:13:59,529
- You know what, can I talk
to your supervisor please?


363
0:13:59,529 --> 0:14:0,496
- I am the supervisor.


364
0:14:0,496 --> 0:14:1,631
- Oh, no.


365
0:14:1,631 --> 0:14:3,366
The bowtie does not make you
a supervisor.


366
0:14:3,366 --> 0:14:5,101
- This is my supervisor bowtie.
- No, it's not.


367
0:14:5,101 --> 0:14:7,27
Can I talk to the person
who is responsible for this?


368
0:14:7,27 --> 0:14:8,638
- I am responsible for everything


369
0:14:8,638 --> 0:14:11,607
In that we are not responsible
for anything.


370
0:14:11,607 --> 0:14:12,642
You know what,


371
0:14:12,642 --> 0:14:14,76
I am never gonna valet here again.


372
0:14:14,76 --> 0:14:15,244
- Never?


373
0:14:15,244 --> 0:14:16,612
- I'm gonna tell everybody too.


374
0:14:16,612 --> 0:14:18,447
I'm gonna tell that this is
not the place to go


375
0:14:18,447 --> 0:14:20,183
To get your car valeted.


376
0:14:20,183 --> 0:14:21,284
- You don't know anybody.


377
0:14:21,284 --> 0:14:22,819
You have two friends on Facebook,


378
0:14:22,819 --> 0:14:27,557
Your cousin and Tom.


379
0:14:27,557 --> 0:14:31,661
You are walking away!


380
0:14:31,661 --> 0:14:33,663
- It's a lose-lose situation.


381
0:14:33,663 --> 0:14:35,164
If we pay out of pocket
to fix the car,


382
0:14:35,164 --> 0:14:37,33
It's gonna cost $500.


383
0:14:37,33 --> 0:14:39,235
- $500?


384
0:14:39,235 --> 0:14:40,87
- Did you call the insurance company?


385
0:14:40,87 --> 0:14:42,4
- Good question. Yes.


386
0:14:42,4 --> 0:14:43,573
And if we filed a claim,


387
0:14:43,573 --> 0:14:45,7
Guess how much the deductible is.


388
0:14:45,7 --> 0:14:47,777
- $500.
- $500.


389
0:14:47,777 --> 0:14:49,679
- And our rate could go up.


390
0:14:49,679 --> 0:14:52,481
- So we get punished because
someone dented the car.


391
0:14:52,481 --> 0:14:53,916
- That's just a shame.


392
0:14:53,916 --> 0:14:55,685
- Uh, anybody want some water?


393
0:14:55,685 --> 0:14:57,887
I'm gonna go get some water
because I'm thirsty.


394
0:14:57,887 --> 0:15:0,323
- Well, mom, do you know
who dented your car?


395
0:15:0,323 --> 0:15:1,657
- The valet at that restaurant.


396
0:15:1,657 --> 0:15:2,859
- Are you sure?


397
0:15:2,859 --> 0:15:4,927
Those valet guys are
usually pretty good drivers.


398
0:15:4,927 --> 0:15:6,262
- Well, this one wasn't.


399
0:15:6,262 --> 0:15:8,13
- All I know is, if I worked
at that valet stand


400
0:15:8,13 --> 0:15:10,132
And I knew the guy
who dented mom's car,


401
0:15:10,132 --> 0:15:11,934
They'd have to pay me a lot of money


402
0:15:11,934 --> 0:15:18,322
For me not to say anything.


403
0:15:18,322 --> 0:15:21,492
- What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?


404
0:15:21,492 --> 0:15:22,76
- I don't know.


405
0:15:22,76 --> 0:15:24,662
It seems like you got yourself
in a real situation.


406
0:15:24,662 --> 0:15:26,764
- Kevin, come on. This isn't funny.


407
0:15:26,764 --> 0:15:28,132
- Oh, trust me. I know.


408
0:15:28,132 --> 0:15:30,434
It's not funny for you,
but it's hilarious over here.


409
0:15:30,434 --> 0:15:33,4
- There's no way I can let
mom and dad find out about this.


410
0:15:33,4 --> 0:15:37,74
- Oh, yeah. I totally agree.
It would be disastrous.


411
0:15:37,74 --> 0:15:39,343
- Kevin
- Yes?


412
0:15:39,343 --> 0:15:41,445
- Please don't tell mom and dad
about this.


413
0:15:41,445 --> 0:15:43,447
- What makes you think
I'd do such a thing?


414
0:15:43,447 --> 0:15:45,583
- Kevin, come on, dude. Please.


415
0:15:45,583 --> 0:15:48,119
- Trust me, Lindsey. I don't want to.


416
0:15:48,119 --> 0:15:49,587
But mom, she loves her car,


417
0:15:49,587 --> 0:15:52,59
And it'd just be awful for me
not to say anything.


418
0:15:52,59 --> 0:15:54,692
- All right. Fine.
What's it gonna cost me?


419
0:15:54,692 --> 0:15:55,726
- I don't know.


420
0:15:55,726 --> 0:15:57,194
I was thinking, like, three figures.


421
0:15:57,194 --> 0:15:59,297
- $100! I'll give you $20.


422
0:15:59,297 --> 0:16:0,731
- $50.


423
0:16:0,731 --> 0:16:2,533
- $35, and I'll keep my mouth
shut the next time


424
0:16:2,533 --> 0:16:4,569
You do something you don't want
them to know about.


425
0:16:4,569 --> 0:16:5,736
- Like what?


426
0:16:5,736 --> 0:16:7,371
- Like extorting your sister
for money.


427
0:16:7,371 --> 0:16:8,673
- Okay, deal.


428
0:16:8,673 --> 0:16:10,274
Uh, do you mind picking up
around here?


429
0:16:10,274 --> 0:16:12,877
I'm thinking about having Troy
over later.


430
0:16:12,877 --> 0:16:14,679
Oh, yeah, you can take that.


431
0:16:14,679 --> 0:16:23,22
She's nasty.


432
0:16:23,22 --> 0:16:25,156
- what'd you get?


433
0:16:25,156 --> 0:16:26,157
What'd you get?


434
0:16:26,157 --> 0:16:28,893
- I got a "c"!


435
0:16:28,893 --> 0:16:30,461
- You got a "c"?


436
0:16:30,461 --> 0:16:32,63
How did you get a "c"?


437
0:16:32,63 --> 0:16:36,33
- Well, my teacher took her pen
and made a little half circle


438
0:16:36,33 --> 0:16:37,969
And told me that
my solar-powered house


439
0:16:37,969 --> 0:16:42,306
Was unoriginal and uninspired.


440
0:16:42,306 --> 0:16:44,275
- I don't believe that.


441
0:16:44,275 --> 0:16:45,443
- Yeah, and she also told me


442
0:16:45,443 --> 0:16:47,211
That if I didn't have the launchpad,


443
0:16:47,211 --> 0:16:49,213
I would have gotten a "d."


444
0:16:49,213 --> 0:16:51,82
Yeah, and she also told me
that that was


445
0:16:51,82 --> 0:16:53,5
The only interesting thing
about the project


446
0:16:53,5 --> 0:16:56,821
And if I had the rocket with it,
I would have gotten an "a."


447
0:16:56,821 --> 0:16:59,256
I mean, I'm just sayin'.
You know, I'm just...


448
0:16:59,256 --> 0:17:2,59
- I'm just sayin', I may be wrong,


449
0:17:2,59 --> 0:17:4,996
But you're still 12, and
by the time the cops get here,


450
0:17:4,996 --> 0:17:6,364
It'll be too late.


451
0:17:6,364 --> 0:17:7,465
- I love you, mommy.


452
0:17:7,465 --> 0:17:12,97
- Mm-Hmm.


453
0:17:12,97 --> 0:17:14,572
- Dad, what are you doing?


454
0:17:14,572 --> 0:17:16,307
- I'm going to picket
the valet at Jimmy's.


455
0:17:16,307 --> 0:17:18,509
Either he's getting fired,
or I'm getting arrested,


456
0:17:18,509 --> 0:17:19,91
But somebody's getting something.


457
0:17:19,91 --> 0:17:24,215
- Dad, wait. You can't go.


458
0:17:24,215 --> 0:17:26,83
I'm the one who dented moms car.


459
0:17:26,83 --> 0:17:27,618
What?


460
0:17:27,618 --> 0:17:29,62
- It happened the other day
while you were asleep.


461
0:17:29,62 --> 0:17:31,422
Kevin was going to wake you up
because he wanted


462
0:17:31,422 --> 0:17:32,89
To go outside and go skateboarding,


463
0:17:32,89 --> 0:17:35,159
But your car was parked
inside the driveway,


464
0:17:35,159 --> 0:17:37,161
So I just thought I'd move it for you,


465
0:17:37,161 --> 0:17:39,664
And I backed into a fire hydrant.


466
0:17:39,664 --> 0:17:42,266
- Girl, I should whup...
- No, let me.


467
0:17:42,266 --> 0:17:43,567
I got this.
- No, no, no.


468
0:17:43,567 --> 0:17:45,536
Baby, run! Run! Go, Lindsey!


469
0:17:45,536 --> 0:17:47,4
- Yeah, you know... you better move.


470
0:17:47,4 --> 0:17:49,373
And try not to hit anything!


471
0:17:49,373 --> 0:17:51,609
- <i>don't back into a fire hydrant</i>


472
0:17:51,609 --> 0:17:53,477
Wasn't on your <i>checklist</i>?


473
0:17:53,477 --> 0:17:56,414
- Oh, don't put this on me, Suzanne.


474
0:17:56,414 --> 0:17:58,215
Look, if you wasn't so busy working


475
0:17:58,215 --> 0:18:0,885
On Kevin's science project,
you wouldn't have fell asleep,


476
0:18:0,885 --> 0:18:2,82
And she wouldn't have had
to move the car.


477
0:18:2,82 --> 0:18:5,322
- Oh, so now this is my fault?


478
0:18:5,322 --> 0:18:7,391
- It's not about whose fault it is.


479
0:18:7,391 --> 0:18:9,293
But if it was...


480
0:18:9,293 --> 0:18:11,462
It'd be yours.


481
0:18:11,462 --> 0:18:13,297
Look, you ain't no different
than the girl


482
0:18:13,297 --> 0:18:15,99
With the parents and the party.


483
0:18:15,99 --> 0:18:17,835
- Yes, I am.
- How?


484
0:18:17,835 --> 0:18:20,538
- I ain't got to explain
myself to you.


485
0:18:20,538 --> 0:18:23,908
- Oh, that's real mature.


486
0:18:23,908 --> 0:18:29,513
You can't hide
from the truth, Suzanne.


487
0:18:29,513 --> 0:18:33,884
- Give me two minutes, please.


488
0:18:33,884 --> 0:18:36,587
- Hey, man.


489
0:18:36,587 --> 0:18:37,755
You remember me?


490
0:18:37,755 --> 0:18:39,9
- No.


491
0:18:39,9 --> 0:18:40,257
- The prius.


492
0:18:40,257 --> 0:18:41,292
- No.


493
0:18:41,292 --> 0:18:42,593
- The blue sweater.


494
0:18:42,593 --> 0:18:44,228
- No.


495
0:18:44,228 --> 0:18:45,296
- We got in an argument.


496
0:18:45,296 --> 0:18:46,397
- No.


497
0:18:46,397 --> 0:18:48,99
- I walked away.


498
0:18:48,99 --> 0:18:50,67
- You... let me see. Turn around.


499
0:18:50,67 --> 0:18:51,669
- Oh, the meats in the back
of your neck.


500
0:18:51,669 --> 0:18:52,803
I remember.


501
0:18:52,803 --> 0:18:55,406
I remember you.
- Okay.


502
0:18:55,406 --> 0:18:56,774
- Blue sweater.
- Yeah, yeah.


503
0:18:56,774 --> 0:18:58,142
- Prius.
- Yes.


504
0:18:58,142 --> 0:18:59,243
- Dent.
- Okay.


505
0:18:59,243 --> 0:19:0,511
- Argument.
- Yeah.


506
0:19:0,511 --> 0:19:1,712
Um, look, look.


507
0:19:1,712 --> 0:19:6,83
I... I came down here to apologize
for how things went.


508
0:19:6,83 --> 0:19:7,284
All right?


509
0:19:7,284 --> 0:19:9,653
It turns out you didn't dent my car.


510
0:19:9,653 --> 0:19:10,821
- Of course I didn't.


511
0:19:10,821 --> 0:19:14,325
And if I did, I'm not responsible.


512
0:19:14,325 --> 0:19:15,86
Who dented the car?


513
0:19:15,86 --> 0:19:16,961
- My daughter.


514
0:19:16,961 --> 0:19:19,497
- Hey! What did she hit?


515
0:19:19,497 --> 0:19:20,898
- A fire hydrant.


516
0:19:20,898 --> 0:19:22,767
- Hey!


517
0:19:22,767 --> 0:19:24,602
Let me get this straight.


518
0:19:24,602 --> 0:19:27,338
So you come here and accuse me,
and all this time,


519
0:19:27,338 --> 0:19:29,306
The criminal is in your own house.


520
0:19:29,306 --> 0:19:32,176
I should sue you
for defamation of character.


521
0:19:32,176 --> 0:19:34,211
- Listen, I'm sorry
you feel that way, man.


522
0:19:34,211 --> 0:19:35,98
That's why I'm... that's why I'm here.


523
0:19:35,98 --> 0:19:37,281
- I don't want to hear it.


524
0:19:37,281 --> 0:19:39,35
You're like Sarah Palin,
and I'm like Barack Obama.


525
0:19:39,35 --> 0:19:41,418
And your daughter, she's George Bush.


526
0:19:41,418 --> 0:19:43,287
Everything's her fault,
but who they blame?


527
0:19:43,287 --> 0:19:44,922
Me, the black man.


528
0:19:44,922 --> 0:19:46,49
- Why are you talking
about my daughter?


529
0:19:46,49 --> 0:19:48,526
She don't got nothing to do
with this right here.


530
0:19:48,526 --> 0:19:50,127
- You mean a criminal
that can't drive?


531
0:19:50,127 --> 0:19:51,829
I have 13 daughters,
and all can drive.


532
0:19:51,829 --> 0:19:52,897
What's wrong with yours?


533
0:19:52,897 --> 0:19:54,231
- Listen, man.


534
0:19:54,231 --> 0:19:56,133
Look, she took responsibility
for her actions.


535
0:19:56,133 --> 0:19:57,935
Why don't you take
responsibility for yours?


536
0:19:57,935 --> 0:20:0,137
- I don't have to. It's in the ticket.


537
0:20:0,137 --> 0:20:1,639
I'm not responsible for anything.


538
0:20:1,639 --> 0:20:2,84
I'll read this to you.


539
0:20:2,84 --> 0:20:5,776
<i>pursuant to law,
operator's liabilities</i>


540
0:20:5,776 --> 0:20:9,146
<i>for laws on damages
to vehicles by fire...</i>


541
0:20:9,146 --> 0:20:10,114
- Yeah, okay.


542
0:20:10,114 --> 0:20:12,383
- <i>theft, explosion.</i>
- Okay.


543
0:20:12,383 --> 0:20:14,285
- Boom!
- Yeah.


544
0:20:14,285 --> 0:20:16,2
- Key rust.
- Okay, look, look.


545
0:20:16,2 --> 0:20:17,521
I know, all right? I know.


546
0:20:17,521 --> 0:20:20,658
How can you open a business
and then write on a piece


547
0:20:20,658 --> 0:20:22,56
Of paper that you have
no idea what you're doing


548
0:20:22,56 --> 0:20:23,794
And then do it anyway?


549
0:20:23,794 --> 0:20:24,862
- Yes.
- Listen.


550
0:20:24,862 --> 0:20:26,163
You can't get a job driving a bus


551
0:20:26,163 --> 0:20:28,165
And then hand everybody
a ticket saying


552
0:20:28,165 --> 0:20:30,734
If you crash into a wall
and kill everybody on board,


553
0:20:30,734 --> 0:20:32,236
Then it's not your fault.


554
0:20:32,236 --> 0:20:33,704
- What's wrong with that?


555
0:20:33,704 --> 0:20:36,24
- You can't open a restaurant
and then hand everybody a ticket


556
0:20:36,24 --> 0:20:38,108
And say you don't know how to cook


557
0:20:38,108 --> 0:20:39,61
And you give everybody food poisoning


558
0:20:39,61 --> 0:20:41,512
And you say it's not
your responsibility.


559
0:20:41,512 --> 0:20:42,98
- Why not?


560
0:20:42,98 --> 0:20:45,649
- You cannot go into a hospital
and then cut somebody open,


561
0:20:45,649 --> 0:20:47,651
Pull out their heart, and kill them


562
0:20:47,651 --> 0:20:49,253
And then hand them a ticket saying


563
0:20:49,253 --> 0:20:52,456
You don't have any responsibility.


564
0:20:52,456 --> 0:20:55,791
- Obviously,
you've never been to Africa.
