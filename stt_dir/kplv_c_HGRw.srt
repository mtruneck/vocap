1
0:0:49,21 --> 0:0:51,12
Cave Hotel


2
0:0:51,12 --> 0:0:53,82
Is a large and commodious establishment


3
0:0:53,82 --> 0:0:56,43
capable of entertaining 500 guests.


4
0:0:56,43 --> 0:0:58,85
It is constructed on the cottage plan


5
0:0:58,85 --> 0:1:3,34
and the rooms are furnished in a style equal to any first class hotel.


6
0:1:3,34 --> 0:1:6,95
It is the beau ideal of a fashionable summer resort


7
0:1:6,95 --> 0:1:8,14
in the South.


8
0:1:8,14 --> 0:1:11,59
A magnificent ball room is attached to the Hotel.


9
0:1:11,59 --> 0:1:14,1
Curious Sand-Stone Rock


10
0:1:14,1 --> 0:1:17,62
Excavated near the cave about 15 years since,


11
0:1:17,62 --> 0:1:21,44
and now to be seen in the hotel yard.


12
0:1:21,44 --> 0:1:24,14
Path Leading to the Mouth of Cave


13
0:1:24,14 --> 0:1:26,18
Is about a quarter of a mile in length


14
0:1:26,18 --> 0:1:27,9
extending from the hotel


15
0:1:27,9 --> 0:1:30,37
through a gorge in a dense wood.


16
0:1:30,37 --> 0:1:34,76
Visitors generally supply themselves with stout branches from the trees


17
0:1:34,76 --> 0:1:40,32
to assist themselves in their explorations of the rugged paths of the cave.


18
0:1:40,32 --> 0:1:42,22
Out for the Last Time


19
0:1:42,22 --> 0:1:44,979
This is a picture of the gentlemen who conceived


20
0:1:44,979 --> 0:1:46,97
and executed the project


21
0:1:46,97 --> 0:1:48,939
of Photographing the cave,


22
0:1:48,939 --> 0:1:52,75
with the reflectors and etcetera used.


23
0:1:52,75 --> 0:1:54,65
Mouth of the Cave


24
0:1:54,65 --> 0:1:57,799
is 194 feet above Green River,


25
0:1:57,799 --> 0:2:0,1
125 feet in height by 


26
0:2:0,1 --> 0:2:1,88
30 in width.


27
0:2:1,88 --> 0:2:6,14
In summer visitors experience a sudden change of temperature when


28
0:2:6,14 --> 0:2:7,909
they stand on the embankment


29
0:2:7,909 --> 0:2:9,42
above the entrance


30
0:2:9,42 --> 0:2:12,519
and a cold blast rushes out from the cave,


31
0:2:12,519 --> 0:2:16,219
the temperature is invariably 59 degrees.


32
0:2:16,219 --> 0:2:19,159
The scene, looking down towards the immediate entrance,


33
0:2:19,159 --> 0:2:21,23
a distance of 100 yards


34
0:2:21,23 --> 0:2:24,269
is picturesque in the extreme


35
0:2:24,269 --> 0:2:25,749
and impresses the beholder


36
0:2:25,749 --> 0:2:29,849
with a feeling of awe at the contemplation of the subterraneous


37
0:2:29,849 --> 0:2:32,269
world beneath his feet.


38
0:2:32,269 --> 0:2:34,189
Mouth of the Cave


39
0:2:34,189 --> 0:2:37,28
This view introduces three well know guides.


40
0:2:37,28 --> 0:2:39,729
The one on the right is old Mat,


41
0:2:39,729 --> 0:2:45,149
he has acted in the capacity of guide for the last 30 years.


42
0:2:45,149 --> 0:2:46,719
Gothic Chapel


43
0:2:46,719 --> 0:2:49,479
A mile from the entrance is a large room


44
0:2:49,479 --> 0:2:54,659
from the ceiling of which hang gigantic stalactites, extending to the floor.


45
0:2:54,659 --> 0:2:58,769
It is represented here as it appeared when lightedup with magnesium light,


46
0:2:58,769 --> 0:3:2,779
the glare of which may be seen behind the columns on the right.


47
0:3:2,779 --> 0:3:5,59
Column of Hercules


48
0:3:5,59 --> 0:3:7,159
Is also in the Gothic Chapel.


49
0:3:7,159 --> 0:3:11,19
It is formed by the union of stalactites and stalagmites


50
0:3:11,19 --> 0:3:13,26
is eight feet in height 


51
0:3:13,26 --> 0:3:15,309
and thirty in circumference.


52
0:3:15,309 --> 0:3:18,569
The length of time necessary to form such a column


53
0:3:18,569 --> 0:3:22,769
may be inferred from the fact that it takes fifty years to form


54
0:3:22,769 --> 0:3:26,459
an incrustation no thicker than a wafer.


55
0:3:26,459 --> 0:3:27,819
The Altar


56
0:3:27,819 --> 0:3:31,819
In the foreground is a cluster of columns called the Altar,


57
0:3:31,819 --> 0:3:35,779
at which a romantic marriage took place between two parties


58
0:3:35,779 --> 0:3:38,139
whose union on the face of the earth


59
0:3:38,139 --> 0:3:41,469
was prevented by family interference.


60
0:3:41,469 --> 0:3:43,459
Devil's Arm Chair,


61
0:3:43,459 --> 0:3:48,529
In Gothic Avenue is a large column about 500 yards beyond the chapel.


62
0:3:48,529 --> 0:3:50,549
There is a niche or seat


63
0:3:50,549 --> 0:3:53,279
and which one of the guides maybe seen sitting.


64
0:3:53,279 --> 0:3:55,1
The ceiling of Gothic Avenue


65
0:3:55,1 --> 0:3:56,719
singularly beautiful


66
0:3:56,719 --> 0:4:0,429
as the stalactites assume the most fantastic shapes.


67
0:4:0,429 --> 0:4:1,949
In the niche of this column


68
0:4:1,949 --> 0:4:4,77
the celebrated Jenny Lind rested for some time 


69
0:4:4,77 --> 0:4:7,669
during her visit to the cave.


70
0:4:7,669 --> 0:4:9,949
End of Gothic Avenue


71
0:4:9,949 --> 0:4:13,39
The avenue terminates about a half mile beyond the chapel


72
0:4:13,39 --> 0:4:16,9
at "Elephant's Head" and "Lover's Leap."


73
0:4:16,9 --> 0:4:18,31
The former is a large stalagmite


74
0:4:18,31 --> 0:4:21,68
shaped like the head of the animal after which it is named


75
0:4:21,68 --> 0:4:24,96
and the latter is a rock projecting 16 feet 


76
0:4:24,96 --> 0:4:27,439
over a black abyss.


77
0:4:27,439 --> 0:4:29,759
Wandering Willie's Spring


78
0:4:29,759 --> 0:4:34,3
trickling down from the roof and the wall of rock


79
0:4:34,3 --> 0:4:36,61
on the left hand side of the Main Cave


80
0:4:36,61 --> 0:4:39,319
beyond the Rotunda and Methodist Church.


81
0:4:39,319 --> 0:4:43,33
It is named after a country violinist who wandered away from his party,


82
0:4:43,33 --> 0:4:45,22
had his lamp extinguished


83
0:4:45,22 --> 0:4:48,43
and was found lying asleep beside the spring.


84
0:4:48,43 --> 0:4:51,6
On the left will be observed some names of visitors


85
0:4:51,6 --> 0:4:53,99
cut on the rock.


86
0:4:53,99 --> 0:4:56,56
The spring is about half a mile from the entrance.


87
0:4:56,56 --> 0:4:58,89
Standing Rocks


88
0:4:58,89 --> 0:5:1,479
Are fifteen feet in length and many tons in weight


89
0:5:1,479 --> 0:5:4,159
and evidently fell from the roof of the cave


90
0:5:4,159 --> 0:5:7,46
at a time when the entire cave was filled with water.


91
0:5:7,46 --> 0:5:9,6
They stand in a upright position


92
0:5:9,6 --> 0:5:13,36
and are 3/4 of a mile from the entrance.


93
0:5:13,36 --> 0:5:15,68
Entrance to Rocky Hall


94
0:5:15,68 --> 0:5:17,22
Looking from Main Cave.


95
0:5:17,22 --> 0:5:19,669
A few feet beyond Standing Rocks


96
0:5:19,669 --> 0:5:22,789
to the left of Main Cave is Rocky Hall.


97
0:5:22,789 --> 0:5:27,49
It is reached by ascending a few steps on rocks piled up at the entrance.


98
0:5:27,49 --> 0:5:29,27
Giant's Coffin


99
0:5:29,27 --> 0:5:31,74
Is an immense rock 40 feet long,


100
0:5:31,74 --> 0:5:34,57
twenty wide and eight high,


101
0:5:34,57 --> 0:5:38,499
which has been detached from the avenue against which it rests.


102
0:5:38,499 --> 0:5:39,38
On the left


103
0:5:39,38 --> 0:5:42,639
beneath the coffin may be seen a narrow passage


104
0:5:42,639 --> 0:5:45,199
which leads into Deserted Chamber.


105
0:5:45,199 --> 0:5:48,86
Giant's Coffin presents a gloomy sepulchral appearance


106
0:5:48,86 --> 0:5:52,229
when lighted up by the glare of the magnesium light.


107
0:5:52,229 --> 0:5:53,9
It is on the right of Main Cave,


108
0:5:53,9 --> 0:5:56,419
one mile from the entrance.


109
0:5:56,419 --> 0:5:58,36
Entrance to Long Route,


110
0:5:58,36 --> 0:6:2,84
Is on the left of Giant's Coffin and so narrow and low that visitors


111
0:6:2,84 --> 0:6:6,439
have to stoop almost to almost to the ground in passing through it.


112
0:6:6,439 --> 0:6:9,599
On the right may be seen the end of Giant's Coffin.


113
0:6:9,599 --> 0:6:13,719
By some it is supposed that the water receded from the main cave


114
0:6:13,719 --> 0:6:15,43
through this passage.


115
0:6:15,43 --> 0:6:17,24
Deserted Chamber,


116
0:6:17,24 --> 0:6:20,769
Is a dreary looking room about 100 feet in length.


117
0:6:20,769 --> 0:6:23,319
The guide in the picture is entering the chamber


118
0:6:23,319 --> 0:6:26,699
from the narrow passage beneath the Giant's Coffin.


119
0:6:26,699 --> 0:6:28,36
In Wooden Bowl Chamber


120
0:6:28,36 --> 0:6:29,84
adjoining this apartment


121
0:6:29,84 --> 0:6:32,68
curious looking Indian bowl was found.


122
0:6:32,68 --> 0:6:34,87
The Indians used long reeds


123
0:6:34,87 --> 0:6:36,129
filled with deer's fat


124
0:6:36,129 --> 0:6:39,58
as torches to guide them through the cave.


125
0:6:39,58 --> 0:6:40,789
Gorin's Dome


126
0:6:40,789 --> 0:6:44,209
Is 200 feet high and 60 wide.


127
0:6:44,209 --> 0:6:47,34
It is reached by descending from the Deserted Chamber


128
0:6:47,34 --> 0:6:52,889
to a narrow rugged causeway called the Labyrinth, passing over a small bridge


129
0:6:52,889 --> 0:6:54,569
and ascending a ladder.


130
0:6:54,569 --> 0:6:57,83
The far side appears like an immense curtain.


131
0:6:57,83 --> 0:7:0,419
When there is a rise in the subterraneous rivers,


132
0:7:0,419 --> 0:7:3,5
the floor of the dome is covered with water


133
0:7:3,5 --> 0:7:5,749
in which eyeless fish are caught.


134
0:7:5,749 --> 0:7:9,889
The view is taken half way between the roof and the floor.


135
0:7:9,889 --> 0:7:14,56
It is called after one of the former proprietors of the cave.


136
0:7:14,56 --> 0:7:17,389
Bottomless Pit and Bridge of Sighs,


137
0:7:17,389 --> 0:7:19,63
Are on the main route to Echo River


138
0:7:19,63 --> 0:7:21,849
and mile-and-a-half from the entrance


139
0:7:21,849 --> 0:7:24,819
The pit is of a immense depth and over it


140
0:7:24,819 --> 0:7:27,469
is thrown a substantial wooden bridge,


141
0:7:27,469 --> 0:7:29,52
across which visitors pass


142
0:7:29,52 --> 0:7:30,69
in the long route and


143
0:7:30,69 --> 0:7:32,779
towards Pensacola Avenue.


144
0:7:32,779 --> 0:7:36,259
The pit presents a sight of awful sublimity


145
0:7:36,259 --> 0:7:38,54
hen its steep sides are lighted


146
0:7:38,54 --> 0:7:39,86
up by the guide.


147
0:7:39,86 --> 0:7:42,59
View From Bridge of Sighs,


148
0:7:42,59 --> 0:7:46,309
Shows a part of Shelby?s Dome overhanging the terrible pit.


149
0:7:46,309 --> 0:7:49,37
It is wild and dreary beyond conception.


150
0:7:49,37 --> 0:7:53,699
The dark avenue to the right is inaccessible to human footsteps,


151
0:7:53,699 --> 0:7:56,569
that is supposed to lead a vast distance


152
0:7:56,569 --> 0:7:59,469
further into the bowels of he earth.


153
0:7:59,469 --> 0:8:1,799
Beyond The Bridge of Sighs,


154
0:8:1,799 --> 0:8:7,729
This view represents two of the guides, just having crossed the bridge towards Reveler's Hall.


155
0:8:7,729 --> 0:8:9,96
They are facing the Bottomless Pit,


156
0:8:9,96 --> 0:8:13,59
overhanging which is the rock in the foreground.


157
0:8:13,59 --> 0:8:15,669
Pit Beneath the Bridge,


158
0:8:15,669 --> 0:8:18,58
Here are the steep sides of the Bottomless Pit


159
0:8:18,58 --> 0:8:20,569
far below the bridge.


160
0:8:20,569 --> 0:8:25,61
The view was taken from a narrow ledge of rocks overhanging the fearful chasm.


161
0:8:25,61 --> 0:8:28,6
The rock on the right projects 30 feet


162
0:8:28,6 --> 0:8:30,199
and extends from the brink of the pit


163
0:8:30,199 --> 0:8:33,26
to 50 feet below the bridge.


164
0:8:33,26 --> 0:8:34,74
Wild Hall,


165
0:8:34,74 --> 0:8:36,75
Is in Pensacola Avenue.


166
0:8:36,75 --> 0:8:39,429
The floor is strewn with immense rocks


167
0:8:39,429 --> 0:8:41,91
that have become detached from the roof.


168
0:8:41,91 --> 0:8:45,5
The cliffs on the left are called the Snow Cliffs,


169
0:8:45,5 --> 0:8:48,9
as they seem to be covered with flakes of snow.


170
0:8:48,9 --> 0:8:51,17
It is two miles from the entrance.


171
0:8:51,17 --> 0:8:53,45
Snowball Archway,


172
0:8:53,45 --> 0:8:57,5
Is also in Pensacola Avenue.


173
0:8:57,5 --> 0:8:59,93
The ceiling of white gypsum looks as if it was covered with snow


174
0:8:59,93 --> 0:9:2,48
and presents a most beautiful appearance.


175
0:9:2,48 --> 0:9:6,81
Symmetry of the natural buttresses which project from the side of the cliff


176
0:9:6,81 --> 0:9:9,98
is also striking and interesting.


177
0:9:9,98 --> 0:9:11,47
Grand Crossing


178
0:9:11,47 --> 0:9:13,53
Is in Pensacola Avenue.


179
0:9:13,53 --> 0:9:17,45
Here four large avenues branch off from the main one.


180
0:9:17,45 --> 0:9:19,51
The rocks here are completely covered


181
0:9:19,51 --> 0:9:22,41
with the names of visitors scratched on them.


182
0:9:22,41 --> 0:9:26,53
Grand Crossing is about 2 miles and a 1/4 from the entrance.


183
0:9:26,53 --> 0:9:28,42
Angelica's Grotto


184
0:9:28,42 --> 0:9:31,6
Is also in Pensacola Avenue.


185
0:9:31,6 --> 0:9:32,619
The little girl in the picture


186
0:9:32,619 --> 0:9:34,96
is resting on Angelica's Couch


187
0:9:34,96 --> 0:9:38,16
over the foot of which hangs the Pine Apple Bush,


188
0:9:38,16 --> 0:9:40,42
a curious looking rock.


189
0:9:40,42 --> 0:9:42,58
Scotchman's Trap


190
0:9:42,58 --> 0:9:44,49
Is on the road to the river,


191
0:9:44,49 --> 0:9:47,21
about 500 yards beyond the Bottomless Pit.


192
0:9:47,21 --> 0:9:49,97
The trap is a small circular opening


193
0:9:49,97 --> 0:9:52,98
through which it is necessary to descend a few steps


194
0:9:52,98 --> 0:9:54,84
to go toward the river.


195
0:9:54,84 --> 0:9:56,56
Over this narrow opening is


196
0:9:56,56 --> 0:10:0,11
suspended a huge rock many tons in weight,


197
0:10:0,11 --> 0:10:1,69
which, if it fell


198
0:10:1,69 --> 0:10:6,11
would completely close up the avenue leading to the Echo River.


199
0:10:6,11 --> 0:10:7,5
The guide in the picture is


200
0:10:7,5 --> 0:10:10,85
standing at the head of the steps.


201
0:10:10,85 --> 0:10:13,8
Dinning in Great Relief


202
0:10:13,8 --> 0:10:17,5
Is entered after passing through the narrow, tortuous passage


203
0:10:17,5 --> 0:10:19,22
called Fat Man's Misery.


204
0:10:19,22 --> 0:10:21,32
It is indeed a relief


205
0:10:21,32 --> 0:10:23,36
for the aching bones of the


206
0:10:23,36 --> 0:10:26,5
visitor after threading the narrow path above mentioned


207
0:10:26,5 --> 0:10:28,19
and the dinner party in the picture


208
0:10:28,19 --> 0:10:29,76
seem to think so.


209
0:10:29,76 --> 0:10:32,4
One of the guides is pouring out some of


210
0:10:32,4 --> 0:10:34,34
Kentucky's unrivaled beverage,


211
0:10:34,34 --> 0:10:35,75
Bourbon Whiskey,


212
0:10:35,75 --> 0:10:38,25
for the relief of his companions.


213
0:10:38,25 --> 0:10:39,83
Bacon Chamber


214
0:10:39,83 --> 0:10:44,66
Is situated to the right of River Hall which is entered from Great Relief.


215
0:10:44,66 --> 0:10:47,4
The curious projections from the roof


216
0:10:47,4 --> 0:10:52,11
resembling flitches of bacon, are caused by the action of water at a period when


217
0:10:52,11 --> 0:10:54,79
the chamber was completely filled with water.


218
0:10:54,79 --> 0:10:59,7
It is one of the best views taken in the cave.


219
0:10:59,7 --> 0:11:2,17
Is immediately above Bacon Chamber


220
0:11:2,17 --> 0:11:6,6
and at the commencement of Spark's Avenue which leads to Mammoth Dome.


221
0:11:6,6 --> 0:11:11,3
Several unexplored avenues branch off here in every direction.


222
0:11:11,3 --> 0:11:12,7
The scene represents a party of bandits


223
0:11:12,7 --> 0:11:17,38
at dinner and as reviewed by the magnesium light


224
0:11:17,38 --> 0:11:25,1
exceeds in Romantic wildness the most extravagant conceptions of Salvator Rosa.


225
0:11:25,1 --> 0:11:27,18
Pillars in Mammoth Dome 


226
0:11:27,18 --> 0:11:30,27
The Mammoth Dome is one of the largest in the world. 


227
0:11:30,27 --> 0:11:32,49
It is 250 feet in height 


228
0:11:32,49 --> 0:11:34,32
and of immense size. 


229
0:11:34,32 --> 0:11:35,65
Those pillars are of 


230
0:11:35,65 --> 0:11:37,1
colossal dimensions 


231
0:11:37,1 --> 0:11:38,86
and standing beneath them 


232
0:11:38,86 --> 0:11:41,66
one would imagine himself amid the ruins 


233
0:11:41,66 --> 0:11:44,29
of some Egyptian temple. 


234
0:11:44,29 --> 0:11:46,11
Corinthian Columns 


235
0:11:46,11 --> 0:11:50,32
Those columns are at the furthest extremity of Mammoth Dome


236
0:11:50,32 --> 0:11:55,16
and resemble the broken columns of the Acropolis of Athens and Corinth.


237
0:11:55,16 --> 0:11:57,56
Cliffs Over the Dead Sea 


238
0:11:57,56 --> 0:12:0,98
The Dead Sea is a black ominous looking body of water,


239
0:12:0,98 --> 0:12:3,53
about 40 feet below the terrace


240
0:12:3,53 --> 0:12:7,16
on which the three persons in the picture are standing.


241
0:12:7,16 --> 0:12:9,21
Visitors pass along the terrace


242
0:12:9,21 --> 0:12:12,8
and descend the ladder on their way to the river.


243
0:12:12,8 --> 0:12:14,86
The sea lies below the foot of the rock


244
0:12:14,86 --> 0:12:18,1
over which the parties in the view are looking.


245
0:12:18,1 --> 0:12:20,44

247
0:12:22,85 --> 0:12:25,26
and five miles from the entrance.


248
0:12:25,26 --> 0:12:28,3
from the entrance. It is at the end of Silliman?s Avenue.


249
0:12:28,3 --> 0:12:29,74
The black gorge to the right


250
0:12:29,74 --> 0:12:32,71
is the entrance to Pass of El Ghor.

252
0:12:37,91 --> 0:12:39,39
Hanging Rocks


253
0:12:39,39 --> 0:12:41,24
Are in the Pass of El Ghor


254
0:12:41,24 --> 0:12:44,22
about a mile from Ole Bull?s concert room.


255
0:12:44,22 --> 0:12:46,939
Visitors experience much uneasiness


256
0:12:46,939 --> 0:12:49,3
in passing under these rocks,


257
0:12:49,3 --> 0:12:52,88
as they seem to be on the point of tumbling down on their heads,


258
0:12:52,88 --> 0:12:55,8
but since the discovery of the cave,


259
0:12:55,8 --> 0:12:57,11
no rocks have been known to fall


260
0:12:57,11 --> 0:12:58,9
in any part of it.


261
0:12:58,9 --> 0:12:59,6
Martha's Vineyard


262
0:12:59,6 --> 0:13:4,18
Is elevated about 20 feet above the Pass of El Ghor


263
0:13:4,18 --> 0:13:7,119
and receives it name from the appearance,


264
0:13:7,119 --> 0:13:11,88
shape and size of the dark stalactites formations on the side and roof


265
0:13:11,88 --> 0:13:14,28
which closely resemble grapes 


266
0:13:14,28 --> 0:13:18,88
Martha?s Vineyard is six miles and a half from the entrance.


267
0:13:18,88 --> 0:13:20,56
Grape Clusters


268
0:13:20,56 --> 0:13:24,27
This view shows a section of the side of Martha?s Vineyard


269
0:13:24,27 --> 0:13:27,51
and sufficiently explains the meaning of the name


270
0:13:27,51 --> 0:13:29,13
which has been given it.


271
0:13:29,13 --> 0:13:31,15
The entire walls of the vineyard


272

The roof seems to be one mass of snowballs


276
0:13:44,18 --> 0:13:48,66
each of which is from 2 to 4 inches in diameter.


277
0:13:48,66 --> 0:13:50,28
