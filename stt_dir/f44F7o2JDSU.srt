FREDDY CORBIN: I always
did art as a kid.


3
0:0:12,38 --> 0:0:14,89
I was the kid in school that
would make the poster for


4
0:0:14,89 --> 0:0:16,32
brushing your teeth
if the teacher


5
0:0:16,32 --> 0:0:18,24
asked me to or whatever.


6
0:0:18,24 --> 0:0:22,2
But I actually fell out of
it for a little while.


7
0:0:22,2 --> 0:0:24,95
I'd pierce my ear and
get called a fag.


8
0:0:24,95 --> 0:0:27,29
And my best friend was gay.


9
0:0:27,29 --> 0:0:29,945
So leaving high school was the
best thing that ever happened


10
0:0:29,945 --> 0:0:33,46
to me because I got to be my
own person and not have to


11
0:0:33,46 --> 0:0:37,51
deal with getting bullied and
all that other stuff.


12
0:0:37,51 --> 0:0:40,245
So I started doing art
a lot more once I


13
0:0:40,245 --> 0:0:41,47
had left high school.


14
0:0:41,47 --> 0:0:44,21
And I was really interested in
punk rock, and I'd always


15
0:0:44,21 --> 0:0:46,76
wanted to move to San Francisco
because I would come


16
0:0:46,76 --> 0:0:51,26
to Berkeley and Haight Street
and was so turned on by it.


17
0:0:51,26 --> 0:0:52,69
I saw beautiful people.


18
0:0:52,69 --> 0:0:58,84
I saw European city style.


19
0:0:58,84 --> 0:1:2,78
I saw people that were
liberal thinking.


20
0:1:2,78 --> 0:1:4,3
I saw freedom.


21
0:1:4,3 --> 0:1:7,75



22
0:1:7,75 --> 0:1:9,19
So I always knew that
I'd be here.


23
0:1:9,19 --> 0:1:11,998

25
0:1:23,52 --> 0:1:24,986
TIM HENDRICKS: The first time I
ever heard of Freddy Corbin,


26
0:1:24,986 --> 0:1:29,59
I was a kid, and I was just
getting into tattooing.


27
0:1:29,59 --> 0:1:32,39
Breaking out in it and meeting
some of the older guys.


28
0:1:32,39 --> 0:1:35,3
And there was this magazine
write-up.


29
0:1:35,3 --> 0:1:38,53
And it said Mr. Niceguy
right on the front.


30
0:1:38,53 --> 0:1:42,64
And I remember seeing it and
being like, who's this little


31
0:1:42,64 --> 0:1:43,65
skinny guy?


32
0:1:43,65 --> 0:1:46,94
This guy kills it.


33
0:1:46,94 --> 0:1:49,82
Even before I got to know
Freddy, if somebody asked me


34
0:1:49,82 --> 0:1:53,42
hey, I'm going up to the Bay
Area, and I want to get a rad


35
0:1:53,42 --> 0:1:55,61
black and grey tattoo
while I'm up there.


36
0:1:55,61 --> 0:1:58,185
I'd be like, well, you've got to
go to Temple Tattoo and get


37
0:1:58,185 --> 0:1:59,98
tattooed by Freddy Corbin.


38
0:1:59,98 --> 0:2:2,54
He took what he knew from
learning from these old


39
0:2:2,54 --> 0:2:7,5
schoolers and brought some black
and grey twist on it.


40
0:2:7,5 --> 0:2:7,62
He made--


41
0:2:7,62 --> 0:2:10,66
I don't know man,
he made a mark.


42
0:2:10,66 --> 0:2:11,91
It's hard to describe.


43
0:2:11,91 --> 0:2:13,56
It's not even really--


44
0:2:13,56 --> 0:2:16,25
like I said, it's Freddy
Corbin style.


45
0:2:16,25 --> 0:2:18,69
JASON MCAFEE: I'd never seen
anyone do a Day of the Dead


46
0:2:18,69 --> 0:2:20,6
skull until Freddy.


47
0:2:20,6 --> 0:2:22,55
When I saw one I was oh, it's
those little, like, candy


48
0:2:22,55 --> 0:2:23,67
sugar skull things.


49
0:2:23,67 --> 0:2:24,6
As a tattoo?


50
0:2:24,6 --> 0:2:27,46
And I think he definitely
brought that


51
0:2:27,46 --> 0:2:30,71
kind of style to tattooing.


52
0:2:30,71 --> 0:2:33,22
TIM HENDRICKS: That style of
doing sugar skulls had been


53
0:2:33,22 --> 0:2:36,96
copied so many times that kids
these days have no idea where


54
0:2:36,96 --> 0:2:37,95
it came from.


55
0:2:37,95 --> 0:2:41,78
FREDDY CORBIN: I mean I will say
that I saw a painting of


56
0:2:41,78 --> 0:2:44,87
one that Malone did before
I ever did one.


57
0:2:44,87 --> 0:2:47,87
So Malone probably had
done one or two.


58
0:2:47,87 --> 0:2:52,15
And Scott Sylvia also was doing
them simultaneously.


59
0:2:52,15 --> 0:2:56,285
So I think it would be safe to
say, as egotistical as it


60
0:2:56,285 --> 0:2:59,22
might sound only because you
asked the question, that Scott


61
0:2:59,22 --> 0:3:2,36
and I might have started the
Day of the Dead thing.


62
0:3:2,36 --> 0:3:6,0
Greys, sugar skull greys,
but who knows?


63
0:3:6,0 --> 0:3:9,23
I never got caught up
in having a thing.


64
0:3:9,23 --> 0:3:12,31
I eventually got known for doing
religious tattoos and


65
0:3:12,31 --> 0:3:14,38
stuff but I love doing
lettering and


66
0:3:14,38 --> 0:3:15,59
black and grey tattoos.


67
0:3:15,59 --> 0:3:19,59
I love that whole East
LA, Chicano look.


68
0:3:19,59 --> 0:3:23,94
I love old English next to
Jesuses next to Guadalupes and


69
0:3:23,94 --> 0:3:25,61
big low rider cars.


70
0:3:25,61 --> 0:3:27,896
And I love that stuff.


71
0:3:27,896 --> 0:3:29,85
JASON MCAFEE: He does a lot
of stuff that I love


72
0:3:29,85 --> 0:3:31,22
to watch him tattoo.


73
0:3:31,22 --> 0:3:34,23
I really, really like when he's
about to start some big


74
0:3:34,23 --> 0:3:35,4
lettering thing.


75
0:3:35,4 --> 0:3:38,77
I don't think people really get
what a craft that is to be


76
0:3:38,77 --> 0:3:41,54
able to do lettering
that good.


77
0:3:41,54 --> 0:3:44,81
Watching him write something
out, there's times when I'm


78
0:3:44,81 --> 0:3:46,8
like, dude, I'm having trouble
with this name.


79
0:3:46,8 --> 0:3:48,99
Would you help me out?


80
0:3:48,99 --> 0:3:52,38
And in just one pass, he'll
write the most beautiful name


81
0:3:52,38 --> 0:3:53,74
you've ever seen.


82
0:3:53,74 --> 0:3:58,19
He's just so good with it,
it's unbelievable.


83
0:3:58,19 --> 0:4:0,48
FREDDY CORBIN: Basically, I was
fortunate enough to work


84
0:4:0,48 --> 0:4:5,524
with a guy named Hollywood,
Mark in Amsterdam.


85
0:4:5,524 --> 0:4:8,3
And he had gone to school
with Cartoon.


86
0:4:8,3 --> 0:4:11,0
They had gone to graphic
art school together.


87
0:4:11,0 --> 0:4:13,7
And he taught me a
lot of tricks.


88
0:4:13,7 --> 0:4:14,136
JASON MCAFEE: I mean, there's
probably so many kids and


89
0:4:14,136 --> 0:4:15,99
tattooers out there right now
who don't even know who


90
0:4:15,99 --> 0:4:17,24
Freddy Corbin is.


91
0:4:17,24 --> 0:4:21,6
He was the young guy, but now
he's become the older


92
0:4:21,6 --> 0:4:22,4
generation.


93
0:4:22,4 --> 0:4:26,7
He's been doing this for 27
years or something crazy.


94
0:4:26,7 --> 0:4:31,31
He is that guy now that people
pay respect to and have love


95
0:4:31,31 --> 0:4:33,56
for and show it.


96
0:4:33,56 --> 0:4:37,59
FREDDY CORBIN: Back then you had
to be half a cowboy to get


97
0:4:37,59 --> 0:4:39,24
into the business.


98
0:4:39,24 --> 0:4:44,6
Tattoo shops drew a weird type
of folk, you know what I mean?


99
0:4:44,6 --> 0:4:47,77
And it was a weird type of
folk that was drawn to


100
0:4:47,77 --> 0:4:50,44
tattooing, especially with
the stigma behind it.


101
0:4:50,44 --> 0:4:55,81
So you were pretty much
embracing an outcast culture.


102
0:4:55,81 --> 0:4:57,6
We were all outcasts.


103
0:4:57,6 --> 0:5:0,93



104
0:5:0,93 --> 0:5:2,446
Do you want hop up?


105
0:5:2,446 --> 0:5:3,38
MALE SPEAKER 1: Yeah.


106
0:5:3,38 --> 0:5:7,466
FREDDY CORBIN: Let me look
at them if you stand real


107
0:5:7,466 --> 0:5:8,716
natural, real straight.


108
0:5:8,716 --> 0:5:11,23



109
0:5:11,23 --> 0:5:13,2
I think they look even.


110
0:5:13,2 --> 0:5:19,92



111
0:5:19,92 --> 0:5:23,41
I always was trying to
be a good tattooer.


112
0:5:23,41 --> 0:5:25,22
I look at tattooing
like any trade.


113
0:5:25,22 --> 0:5:27,7
Like being a plumber or a
shoemaker, or whatever.


114
0:5:27,7 --> 0:5:29,32
I just want to be good at it.


115
0:5:29,32 --> 0:5:32,23
I just want to own a shop
that's going to be an


116
0:5:32,23 --> 0:5:35,28
institution of good tattooing
so people can come and know


117
0:5:35,28 --> 0:5:37,84
that no matter who's working
there that day, that they'll


118
0:5:37,84 --> 0:5:40,72
get a solid tattoo, they'll get
treated with respect, and


119
0:5:40,72 --> 0:5:42,4
they'll leave happy.


120
0:5:42,4 --> 0:5:43,526
That's my goal.


121
0:5:43,526 --> 0:5:50,47
[MUSIC PLAYING]


122
0:5:50,47 --> 0:5:52,85
MAX SCHAAF: Freddy has two
shops, Temple and 13.


123
0:5:52,85 --> 0:5:55,23
And Temple is the
original one.


124
0:5:55,23 --> 0:5:58,38
And going to Temple is like, you
walk in, and you're like,


125
0:5:58,38 --> 0:5:59,89
ooh, Temple.


126
0:5:59,89 --> 0:6:2,45
This is a place,
this is gnarly.


127
0:6:2,45 --> 0:6:3,75
It's a cool place to be.


128
0:6:3,75 --> 0:6:20,54
[MUSIC PLAYING]


129
0:6:20,54 --> 0:6:21,42
FREDDY CORBIN: It
took me a while.


130
0:6:21,42 --> 0:6:22,86
I had to postpone it a year.


131
0:6:22,86 --> 0:6:25,43
I tried opening up in '97.


132
0:6:25,43 --> 0:6:28,82
Couldn't get a place so I put it
on hold and then came back.


133
0:6:28,82 --> 0:6:31,626
And then in '98 opened
up Temple Tattoo.


134
0:6:31,626 --> 0:6:35,8



135
0:6:35,8 --> 0:6:41,96
Now it's me, Heath Preheim,
Jason McAfee, and Chummy


136
0:6:41,96 --> 0:6:44,33
Alexanian works there
part time.


137
0:6:44,33 --> 0:6:48,23
Jason McAfee I met through
tattooing him.


138
0:6:48,23 --> 0:6:50,2
He's a super solid dude.


139
0:6:50,2 --> 0:6:54,48
We clicked, and I asked him to
come cover while I went to


140
0:6:54,48 --> 0:6:56,65
Japan that first Tokyo
convention.


141
0:6:56,65 --> 0:6:58,8
JASON MCAFEE: And he
randomly called me.


142
0:6:58,8 --> 0:7:0,56
And I almost had a heart
attack in the shop.


143
0:7:0,56 --> 0:7:1,41
We all did.


144
0:7:1,41 --> 0:7:4,4
Me and Chops, and Kelly Krantz
and all these guys were like,


145
0:7:4,4 --> 0:7:4,51
what the fuck?


146
0:7:4,51 --> 0:7:6,15
How come Freddy Corbin
called you?


147
0:7:6,15 --> 0:7:7,96
I don't know, I met him once.


148
0:7:7,96 --> 0:7:9,6
And I was like, oh my god.


149
0:7:9,6 --> 0:7:12,69
Like it was meeting some famous
rock star or something


150
0:7:12,69 --> 0:7:14,22
for me at that time
because I was so


151
0:7:14,22 --> 0:7:15,89
obsessed with tattooing.


152
0:7:15,89 --> 0:7:18,76
And he gave me that for my
birthday couple years ago,


153
0:7:18,76 --> 0:7:23,57
which is from a Tattoo Time
book, it's the original.


154
0:7:23,57 --> 0:7:28,69
And it was a weird, emotional
thing because I'd looked at


155
0:7:28,69 --> 0:7:30,854
that piece of flash forever
and ever and ever


156
0:7:30,854 --> 0:7:31,65
since I was a kid.


157
0:7:31,65 --> 0:7:37,82
And then to be holding it and
have it was like, oh my god.


158
0:7:37,82 --> 0:7:40,65
I got the Tattoo Time books, and
that's how I first heard


159
0:7:40,65 --> 0:7:42,4
about Freddy Corbin.


160
0:7:42,4 --> 0:7:43,94
They're the old books that
Ed used to put out


161
0:7:43,94 --> 0:7:45,1
on tattoos and stuff.


162
0:7:45,1 --> 0:7:47,17
And I was probably 16.


163
0:7:47,17 --> 0:7:49,8
I would look at them
and see pictures of


164
0:7:49,8 --> 0:7:51,2
Freddy's tattoos in there.


165
0:7:51,2 --> 0:7:53,36
Something attracted me
to the Freddy ones.


166
0:7:53,36 --> 0:7:55,335
He's also the first
young dude.


167
0:7:55,335 --> 0:8:0,34
To see this young guy with all
these old guys pop up and be


168
0:8:0,34 --> 0:8:3,53
this little ghetto Nick
Cave kind of dude.


169
0:8:3,53 --> 0:8:6,95
Like cool hair, and he had
diamonds in his teeth and


170
0:8:6,95 --> 0:8:8,5
Mexican style frames.


171
0:8:8,5 --> 0:8:11,755
MALE SPEAKER 2: Hey, how
are you doing Freddy?


172
0:8:11,755 --> 0:8:13,24
Look at these.


173
0:8:13,24 --> 0:8:15,71
JASON MCAFEE: He was a
sharp looking dude.


174
0:8:15,71 --> 0:8:19,67
He wore cool jean vests with
Jesus on them, and he drove


175
0:8:19,67 --> 0:8:23,88
cool, old cars, and that just
wasn't really happening.


176
0:8:23,88 --> 0:8:25,66
HEATH PREHEIM: That's one of
those names, like when is the


177
0:8:25,66 --> 0:8:27,44
first time you heard
Chevrolet?


178
0:8:27,44 --> 0:8:29,96
I think I heard these
older, punker


179
0:8:29,96 --> 0:8:32,22
girls say Freddy Corbin.


180
0:8:32,22 --> 0:8:34,809
And it was one of those names
when you heard it where you're


181
0:8:34,809 --> 0:8:35,51
like, man that's a cool name.


182
0:8:35,51 --> 0:8:38,39
That dude must be cool.


183
0:8:38,39 --> 0:8:42,7
And that's how it has
been to this day


184
0:8:42,7 --> 0:8:58,75
[MUSIC PLAYING]


185
0:8:58,75 --> 0:8:59,8
HEATH PREHEIM: He's
one of those dudes


186
0:8:59,8 --> 0:9:1,84
that has that thing.


187
0:9:1,84 --> 0:9:4,32
You or I might walk into the
room and be like, did you hear


188
0:9:4,32 --> 0:9:5,712
I had a kid?


189
0:9:5,712 --> 0:9:7,9
Did you hear I got
my face tattooed?


190
0:9:7,9 --> 0:9:11,73
Duke Freddy, he walks into the
room and that's who he is.


191
0:9:11,73 --> 0:9:13,99
You have to be, has he always
had that fucking


192
0:9:13,99 --> 0:9:16,33
tattoo on his face?


193
0:9:16,33 --> 0:9:18,61
He's fucking cool.


194
0:9:18,61 --> 0:9:20,21
TIM HENDRICKS: Especially
today, you see all these


195
0:9:20,21 --> 0:9:23,23
people with face tattoos
and neck tattoos.


196
0:9:23,23 --> 0:9:26,44
And it's like, oh, my indie
band got signed.


197
0:9:26,44 --> 0:9:29,78
I'm only 21, but I'm going
to get my neck tattooed.


198
0:9:29,78 --> 0:9:33,94
With Freddy, he's been around
this for so long that he just


199
0:9:33,94 --> 0:9:36,21
wears it well.


200
0:9:36,21 --> 0:9:38,14
There's no one else that
can wear a face


201
0:9:38,14 --> 0:9:40,37
tattoo like Freddy Corbin.


202
0:9:40,37 --> 0:9:41,73
HEATH PREHEIM: I never thought
about it 'til right now, but I


203
0:9:41,73 --> 0:9:43,24
can't picture him as a kid.


204
0:9:43,24 --> 0:9:47,48
Like a 14-year-old or a
16-year-old in school reading


205
0:9:47,48 --> 0:9:49,26
Catcher in the Rye.


206
0:9:49,26 --> 0:9:53,55
He's always been slicked
back hair, tattoos.


207
0:9:53,55 --> 0:9:55,87
How are you doing
bro, hey bro.


208
0:9:55,87 --> 0:9:58,2
Bro is a gross word when most
people say it, but when he


209
0:9:58,2 --> 0:10:0,33
says it, you're like
ah, yeah, bro.


210
0:10:0,33 --> 0:10:1,52
JASON MCAFEE: Thanks
for the birthday


211
0:10:1,52 --> 0:10:2,77
vacation, working here.


212
0:10:2,77 --> 0:10:3,86
FREDDY CORBIN: Oh, of course,
you deserve it dude.


213
0:10:3,86 --> 0:10:6,83
I told him the smartest thing he
did was fucking stay home.


214
0:10:6,83 --> 0:10:8,79
At home vacations are
the way to go.


215
0:10:8,79 --> 0:10:10,76
JASON MCAFEE: It's been nice.


216
0:10:10,76 --> 0:10:13,86
HEATH PREHEIM: It's funny
because Jason McAfee is one of


217
0:10:13,86 --> 0:10:14,77
my best friends.


218
0:10:14,77 --> 0:10:17,31
And I go by 13 every day.


219
0:10:17,31 --> 0:10:18,86
It's on my route.


220
0:10:18,86 --> 0:10:24,32
And Freddy lives by 13 so
that's why I see him.


221
0:10:24,32 --> 0:10:24,7
[LAUGHING]


222
0:10:24,7 --> 0:10:26,2
FREDDY CORBIN: OK, yeah.


223
0:10:26,2 --> 0:10:30,31
Can I ask you how do you feel
about this neighborhood being


224
0:10:30,31 --> 0:10:32,55
gentrified?


225
0:10:32,55 --> 0:10:33,9
MALE SPEAKER 3: We need
more marijuana.


226
0:10:33,9 --> 0:10:34,64
FREDDY CORBIN: Oh yeah we do.


227
0:10:34,64 --> 0:10:38,7
I hear that brother.


228
0:10:38,7 --> 0:10:42,21
I say we never trust our
government, sonny, never.


229
0:10:42,21 --> 0:10:46,62
Never get the chip, never
trust the president.


230
0:10:46,62 --> 0:10:49,62
HEATH PREHEIM: 13 is a real
fucking tattoo shop.


231
0:10:49,62 --> 0:10:51,67
Everyone's good that
works there.


232
0:10:51,67 --> 0:10:54,53
But they're all fucking
fuck-ups that


233
0:10:54,53 --> 0:10:56,68
tattoo, and it's rad.


234
0:10:56,68 --> 0:11:0,12
Freddy's smart enough to hire
dudes that want to work.


235
0:11:0,12 --> 0:11:1,8
Dudes that like to party.


236
0:11:1,8 --> 0:11:4,76
Because I think that's important
in tattooing.


237
0:11:4,76 --> 0:11:7,875
They used to have Friday
the 13th parties,


238
0:11:7,875 --> 0:11:11,27
and you get $13 tattoos.


239
0:11:11,27 --> 0:11:15,98
Freddy did a 13 on my butt as
a joke, but that's my only


240
0:11:15,98 --> 0:11:17,53
Freddy Corbin tattoo.


241
0:11:17,53 --> 0:11:21,25
I was drunk, and you leave there
like, god, who's going


242
0:11:21,25 --> 0:11:22,803
to fucking clean this up?


243
0:11:22,803 --> 0:11:23,63
What's Freddy going to think?


244
0:11:23,63 --> 0:11:26,4
Freddy's going to walk in there
and go, I've done that


245
0:11:26,4 --> 0:11:27,31
1,000 times bro.


246
0:11:27,31 --> 0:11:28,99
Did you guys have a good time?


247
0:11:28,99 --> 0:11:32,57
Hey next time, don't let someone
sit on my chair.


248
0:11:32,57 --> 0:11:35,79
Or whatever, it's going
to be that simple.


249
0:11:35,79 --> 0:11:38,28
FREDDY CORBIN: I'm not
really their boss.


250
0:11:38,28 --> 0:11:42,57
I'm their friend, and I just
happen to be their boss.


251
0:11:42,57 --> 0:11:46,5
It was a free for all for a
while because like I was


252
0:11:46,5 --> 0:11:49,96
saying, we're all brothers
so nobody wants to


253
0:11:49,96 --> 0:11:51,39
rat out their brother.


254
0:11:51,39 --> 0:11:54,12
And when it comes down to
it, what I say goes.


255
0:11:54,12 --> 0:11:55,95
And they all give me that
respect and they are all


256
0:11:55,95 --> 0:11:57,85
wonderful about that.


257
0:11:57,85 --> 0:12:1,21
It's almost like I've had to say
OK, if you're not going to


258
0:12:1,21 --> 0:12:4,38
come in, you have to call me and
tell me because no one's


259
0:12:4,38 --> 0:12:6,24
going to rat you out.


260
0:12:6,24 --> 0:12:7,93
I need to know what's
going on.


261
0:12:7,93 --> 0:12:10,72
I'm not going to be mad, but
I kinda gotta need to know


262
0:12:10,72 --> 0:12:14,55
because there's been times where
someone will say oh, I


263
0:12:14,55 --> 0:12:15,22
want to go down--


264
0:12:15,22 --> 0:12:17,69
I'll go to send somebody up
to 13 because we're busy.


265
0:12:17,69 --> 0:12:19,84
That's another reason why I
opened is to be our own


266
0:12:19,84 --> 0:12:21,38
competition.


267
0:12:21,38 --> 0:12:26,22
Tattoo 13, it was
a guerilla move.


268
0:12:26,22 --> 0:12:28,84
I knew that this neighborhood
was going to blow up.


269
0:12:28,84 --> 0:12:30,16
And I knew that--


270
0:12:30,16 --> 0:12:32,4
I actually tried to open up in
this neighborhood, but nobody


271
0:12:32,4 --> 0:12:33,6
would rent to me.


272
0:12:33,6 --> 0:12:34,91
I opened it up about
a year and a half


273
0:12:34,91 --> 0:12:37,2
after I opened up Temple.


274
0:12:37,2 --> 0:12:39,25
It was premature.


275
0:12:39,25 --> 0:12:42,56
I knew that it was premature,
but I went for it.


276
0:12:42,56 --> 0:12:44,12
And it worked out really well.


277
0:12:44,12 --> 0:12:45,3
I'm glad I didn't listen
to anybody.


278
0:12:45,3 --> 0:12:47,192
OK, bye, you guys.


279
0:12:47,192 --> 0:12:50,51



280
0:12:50,51 --> 0:12:52,53
HEATH PREHEIM: I mean, our
economy is fucked right now,


281
0:12:52,53 --> 0:12:54,56
but they're tattooing
every day there.


282
0:12:54,56 --> 0:12:57,68
Jason's got a kid
and an ex-wife.


283
0:12:57,68 --> 0:13:1,78
And he's gotta handle his
business and still party and


284
0:13:1,78 --> 0:13:2,85
have a good time.


285
0:13:2,85 --> 0:13:6,28
And he can do that working
for Freddy.


286
0:13:6,28 --> 0:13:9,48
Freddy opened Temple
13 years ago.


287
0:13:9,48 --> 0:13:12,14
So Jason was there from
the beginning.


288
0:13:12,14 --> 0:13:15,97
JASON MCAFEE: I've seen the shop
go through so many insane


289
0:13:15,97 --> 0:13:19,5
changes, it's pretty nuts.


290
0:13:19,5 --> 0:13:21,47
Freddy was the first white
guy on this whole block.


291
0:13:21,47 --> 0:13:22,92
When I first started working
here, everyone


292
0:13:22,92 --> 0:13:25,8
thought I was him.


293
0:13:25,8 --> 0:13:27,3
I would go to the store, and
they'd like Freddy, what's up?


294
0:13:27,3 --> 0:13:28,78
And I was like oh,
I'm not Freddy.


295
0:13:28,78 --> 0:13:31,302
He popped up in the middle of
this area and people were just


296
0:13:31,302 --> 0:13:32,95
like, what the fuck?


297
0:13:32,95 --> 0:13:36,11
Downtown Oakland used to
be totally different.


298
0:13:36,11 --> 0:13:37,49
FREDDY CORBIN: This is actually
after we had been


299
0:13:37,49 --> 0:13:39,84
open, and the windows got busted
out from the protests


300
0:13:39,84 --> 0:13:41,71
from Oscar Grant getting shot.


301
0:13:41,71 --> 0:13:43,1
HEATH PREHEIM: I'd tell someone
next to me on the


302
0:13:43,1 --> 0:13:46,29
airplane, I'm from Oakland.
"Oh, god." That's what


303
0:13:46,29 --> 0:13:48,0
everyone thinks of Oakland.


304
0:13:48,0 --> 0:13:51,81
He could have opened a shop
in San Francisco.


305
0:13:51,81 --> 0:13:55,66
Man, I get choked up thinking
about him making that decision


306
0:13:55,66 --> 0:13:59,35
because Oakland means
so much to me.


307
0:13:59,35 --> 0:14:3,51
But he chose to open
a shop downtown.


308
0:14:3,51 --> 0:14:8,21
That neighborhood, when he
did it, was way cutty.


309
0:14:8,21 --> 0:14:10,54
We'd skateboard there on
weekends because there's no


310
0:14:10,54 --> 0:14:11,58
businesses down there.


311
0:14:11,58 --> 0:14:12,92
No one wants to be down there.


312
0:14:12,92 --> 0:14:15,82
There's no reason to
be down there.


313
0:14:15,82 --> 0:14:17,795
FREDDY CORBIN: I don't want to
say it was a huge ghetto, you


314
0:14:17,795 --> 0:14:18,41
know what I mean?


315
0:14:18,41 --> 0:14:22,56
But it was crack head heaven.


316
0:14:22,56 --> 0:14:26,58
So there isn't really a
reason to come over,


317
0:14:26,58 --> 0:14:29,4
you know what I mean?


318
0:14:29,4 --> 0:14:32,56
But I've worked in so many
low income areas and


319
0:14:32,56 --> 0:14:34,4
was cool with that.


320
0:14:34,4 --> 0:14:39,96
Plus I knew it made sense that
with San Francisco blowing up


321
0:14:39,96 --> 0:14:43,96
the way it was, like Manhattan,
people have to


322
0:14:43,96 --> 0:14:47,26
migrate east.


323
0:14:47,26 --> 0:14:50,35
HEATH PREHEIM: The weed places
and all that shit are there


324
0:14:50,35 --> 0:14:55,7
now because of him or because
someone had to pave the way.


325
0:14:55,7 --> 0:14:58,86
And Freddy was the dude that--


326
0:14:58,86 --> 0:15:1,49
it probably was the price,
probably how the space was


327
0:15:1,49 --> 0:15:3,91
shaped, he knew he could
fit everyone in there.


328
0:15:3,91 --> 0:15:10,0
But had enough foresight to
say, this is the spot.


329
0:15:10,0 --> 0:15:12,82
FREDDY CORBIN: This is some
early Temple, Temple Tattoo,


330
0:15:12,82 --> 0:15:14,3
Oakland tattooing.


331
0:15:14,3 --> 0:15:20,1
"Fuck the world, I'm a killer,
you just don't know it yet."


332
0:15:20,1 --> 0:15:22,7
This was this little Crip kid
that I had covered up BK on


333
0:15:22,7 --> 0:15:26,7
and put his family's name on
him and stuff like that.


334
0:15:26,7 --> 0:15:28,9
Even though I'm not really into
violence or whatever, I


335
0:15:28,9 --> 0:15:32,45
love that whole East LA
gangster imagery.


336
0:15:32,45 --> 0:15:34,65
I've always been really,
really attracted to it.


337
0:15:34,65 --> 0:15:37,33
And that's why I've always
really liked working in places


338
0:15:37,33 --> 0:15:41,4
like Philly, or Oakland, or
Sacramento, where there's a


339
0:15:41,4 --> 0:15:43,36
bunch of kids from the hood
getting tattooed.


340
0:15:43,36 --> 0:15:47,768
I could do tattoos like that all
day for weeks and not be


341
0:15:47,768 --> 0:15:52,54
bummed out about it
at all, you know?


342
0:15:52,54 --> 0:15:54,93
Anywhere there's a low income
area, you knew it.


343
0:15:54,93 --> 0:15:56,53
You'd do pit bulls, you'd
do grim reapers.


344
0:15:56,53 --> 0:16:2,7
You'd do cash money maker,
you'd do money signs.


345
0:16:2,7 --> 0:16:5,425
Fuck the world, the world
with the fuck you finger


346
0:16:5,425 --> 0:16:7,72
busting out of it.


347
0:16:7,72 --> 0:16:10,27
Playboy bunny ring,
shit like that.


348
0:16:10,27 --> 0:16:12,7
I think it's hilarious.


349
0:16:12,7 --> 0:16:13,87
I love doing it too.


350
0:16:13,87 --> 0:16:15,37
It's cool shit.
