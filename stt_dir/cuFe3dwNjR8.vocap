###29 (Children shouting)
###37 ñ Are you all right? ñ No, I'm fine, yeah.
###45 (# Menacing music)
###56 Hello, Mrs... er...
###61 Certainly, Headmaster.
###65 Er, how are the erm?
###68 ñ Oh, they're fine. ñ Good. Good.
###78 ñ (Raucous chanting) lñañan! ñ lañañn!
###82 Here, lan, what's brown and hard and doesn't make sense?
###85 Er, I don't know.
###87 (Gibberish) Tough shit.
###90 It was in the bog.
###93 ñ (Door opens) ñ Sis!
###95 ñ Hi. Don't lift me up. ñ I'm not gonna lift you up.
###97 ñ Can you change that for me? ñ Yeah, no problem.
###100 Supergiñiñirl!
###102 ñ Just two fives is lovely. ñ She used to love that.
###105 You're a star. Thank you. Hi, lan. You always seem to be in here.
###108 It's nice to be where everybody knows your name.
###111 There you go, Steve.
###113 ñ That's a joke between him and himself. ñ Yes.
###115 I have noticed, when talking with the children,
###119 they've started referring to you as, erm, Lisa.
###123 Rather than Miss or, indeed, er, Mrs... Lyons.
###128 Yeah. Honor, Derek and I decided to change it a couple of months ago.
###132 ñ The children seem to prefer it. ñ Yes. I'd like the practice to stop.
###135 Oh, why?
###137 For the same reason I don't want my chiropodist calling me by my first name.
###141 Is it helpful to compare the person who does your feet
###144 with an eightñyearñold whose trust you're trying to earn?
###147 Yes, I'd like the practice to stop.
###151 Thank you.
###153 And the... school governors are about to meet
###156 and I'd like to confirm your husband's appointment to their number.
###159 Yes, I don't think he is the best choice.
###162 He's a fresh face in the village.
###164 It isn't really that, though, is it?
###167 It's no secret that I admire his stance on discipline.
###170 He smacked a difficult child he was photographing, which he regrets.
###173 Well, I... I've sent him a letter. I just thought you should know.
###177 ñ So is that the criteria? ñ "On".
###181 Criterion.
###182 Is that the criterion now? You whack a child and become a governor?
###186 I don't think you know lan very well if...
###188 ñ (Pencil sharpening) ñ Never mind.
###193 D'you think I'll get a chain of office?
###195 Or a special little black car with little black windows?
###198 No.
###200 Will people have to call me "Governor"?
###202 In the chemist, "Good afternoon, Governor lan, here's your Preparation H."
###206 It's not that much of an honour. They have trouble finding anyone at all.
###210 I wouldn't be surprised if they'd already asked about 88 people.
###214 ñ Oh, really? ñ What d'you mean, "Oh, really?"?
###217 I'm getting just a whiff of... jealousy here.
###220 (Chuckling) I'm not jealous.
###222 It's because, effectively, now I'm your boss, isn't it?
###225 ñ No, you're not. ñ First thing I'm gonna do
###227 is make all the lady teachers wear seeñthrough, short, leather skirts.
###233 So I can see their pants. Then they'll all have to straddle me, one by one.
###237 ñ You're drinking too much. ñ What else is there to do here?
###240 ñ Apart from hoe. ñ Mm... nothing.
###244 ñ "Nothing, Governor." ñ Shh! Nothing, Governor.
###249 No, it's a serious job. I'll take it seriously.
###254 You may get up now. The governor can't feel his left leg.
###258 So, that's agreed. We shall advertise for a new dinner lady,
###263 but this time we'll specify someone with a cooking background.
###267 ñ Mm. ñ Yes? Agreed on that? Good. Thank you.
###270 I always think they should be called school lunch ladies, don't you?
###273 ñ Hm? ñ Although, nowadays,
###275 school lunch persons would be considered more appropriate.
###279 ñ Hm! PC... PC... ñ (Laughing)
###284 Apologies. Turkey business.
###287 Mr Lyons, this is Mr Yardley,
###289 who's been an honorary governor for some... 30 years.
###293 I know. He's my fatherñinñlaw.
###296 Of course. One occasionally forgets
###299 that everyone in this village is related.
###306 Oh... (Clears throat)
###309 The, er, west wall short corridor
###313 is still extremely damp.
###315 Bringing a rather nasty fungus, from all accounts,
###318 ñ which children are starting to pick at. ñ Indeed.
###323 ñ I'll get some of my men to fix it. ñ Thank you, Mr Yardley.
###326 ñ Isn't that a false economy? ñ What?
###330 The local education authority will never fund a realistic maintenance programme
###335 if the school's being repaired ad hoc outside the budget.
###340 You are obviously not familiar with the concept of a community looking after itself.
###345 No, I am. It's just that, surely help like this from Snowle's major fowl tsar
###351 would be better spent on projects that the authority won't fund.
###354 I think you've got a point there, Mr Lyons.
###357 Yes, instead... instead, Mr Yardley, perhaps you could contribute help in kind
###363 to the Millennium millpond.
###368 Yes. All right.
###371 Thank you. Thank you.
###374 Good.
###376 ñ (Laughter) ñ (Man) Minicab for Mr Lyons.
###381 ñ Oh... ñ (Giggling)
###384 Someone keeps letting the tyres down on the mobile library.
###390 Really?
###392 Erm, yes.
###394 ñ (Young men belching) ñ Perhaps it's a slow puncture.
###398 ñ Or... ñ Er, I don't think so.
###402 Ah.
###404 Probably some bastard from... WHSmith's.
###411 I think they've changed the sherry in here.
###416 (Laughing)
###418 Can you excuse me, please? I want to go to the toilet.
###424 Mm.
###426 ñ Mm. ñ It's a bit tinny.
###428 ñ Are you all right there, mate? ñ Poof.
###433 ñ D'you know who you look like in a tie? ñ What?
###436 ñ A complete wanker. A wanker's wanker. ñ It's my pillarñofñtheñcommunity look.
###440 ñ Pillock of the community. ñ Top joke, John!
###443 I had to get out of there. My brains are gonna start tumbling out.
###446 Have a lager. We bought four pints each to cut down on the walking.
###450 Topñup. Whoo!
###452 ñ Wahey! ñ Hey!
###454 Just... just... just one.
###457 ñ Oh, yeah! ñ Oh, yeah!
###460 (Laughing)
###466 # Two men went to mow #
###468 I've always wanted one of these.
###471 ñ What, a cricket pitch? Yeah! ñ (Both laughing)
###474 ñ Hey, listen, lan. ñ Yeah.
###476 ñ I've got a secret, right? ñ OK.
###478 I've always really badly wanted to have sex with my sister, Helen.
###487 So have I!
###492 Oh, you're very frightening!
###494 (Laughing)
###499 ñ (Horn) ñ (Tyres screeching)
###514 (Dog barking)
###516 That is incredibly poor roadñholding.
###518 (Laughing hysterically)
###523 Oh, shit. We'd better make ourselves scarce.
###526 OK. You be plutonium
###528 and I'll be some diamonds.
###534 (Snorting)
###536 It's OK! It's OK! I am a governor.
###540 I am a governor. Go into your house and prepare for government.
###549 ñ Oh, can I turn the radio on now? ñ (lan) No. Please. No.
###553 ñ No noise. No noise. ñ Shall I ring up Jean Bulmer
###557 and tell her you're feeling too shitty to photograph her today?
###561 No. No.
###564 I'll be all right. In a week.
###567 Did Norriswood complain about the kids calling us by our first names?
###571 Why do people drink, anyway?
###575 I mean, what is the point of it? Standing around tipping it into your face.
###580 I've never seen it.
###583 ñ Maybe you should give up for a while. ñ Yeah. That's a good idea.
###587 ñ You have been knocking it back a bit. ñ Yeah.
###589 The only friends you've made are the Hubners, who run the offñlicence.
###593 They're nice people. We should have them round,
###595 if only to see what bottles they bring.
###597 You could just give up for a month.
###600 No, you have to do it forever.
###602 Make a clean break. Leave it behind.
###604 Go on, leave it.
###607 Tea.
###611 Start... start with a month.
###614 Then segue into forever.
###617 OK, who can tell me where the two lungs are? Anyone?
###622 (Panting)
###623 Yep, Joe? Would you like to point out on the diagram?
###628 ñ (Giggling) ñ Erm, no, you know that's not right.
###630 Pop yourself back in the seat, good lad. Erm... lungs.
###635 Someone must know where the lungs are. No?
###638 OK, lungs are there and there and they're for breathing.
###642 So, the stomach. Who knows where the tummy is?
###645 ñ Me! Me! ñ Derek! Derek!
###648 You're all very good at the tummy.
###650 Now open them up and have a look at the shape.
###655 Natalie, hold yours up, show the headmaster.
###658 ñ How lovely. ñ Lisa, Lisa, mine's torn.
###661 ñ It doesn't matter. ñ Can I have more paper?
###664 ñ We've already discussed this. ñ No.
###666 ñ Gavin, d'you want a drink? ñ Oh, cheers. Pint.
###669 A pint for Gavin and a fruit juice for me, please.
###672 ñ Fruit juice? ñ I've giving up booze for the month.
###675 What, is that cos you rode on the motorñmower?
###677 No, no. It's about proving I can do it, really.
###680 Be brutal with me if you see me wavering.
###689 Crispy triangle?
###694 The hardest job in building, in all building, is hanging doors properly.
###700 No, Phil, that's the easiest job.
###702 No, no. It looks easiest, but it's the hardest.
###705 Well, I don't know. I'm a bit torn.
###707 ñ Why? ñ Well, er, yeah.
###709 Might I suggest it's somewhere between the two?
###712 Ooh, everyone listen to Captain Sensible, Mr Noñdrinks.
###718 Why don't you sponsor me?
###720 ñ In what? ñ Not drinking.
###722 For a month, say. If I could do a month you could all give me 90 quid.
###726 (All laugh)
###728 ñ I'm just gonna get a quick pint. ñ No!
###731 No, no, Mrs.
###733 I insist that pupils at this school
###736 call their teachers by the traditional Sir or Miss.
###741 ñ The three of us discussed this... ñ Failure to do so
###744 is one more symptom of the erosion of discipline in schools
###747 and thence in society as a whole.
###749 The belief that we're all the same,
###752 that a sevenñyearñold girl has the same rights and privileges
###756 as a... justice of the peace.
###757 ñ Well, doesn't she? ñ No.
###760 It's the same process of enforced intimacy whereby in my petrol station
###764 I'm ritually called "mate". Indeed, I know that matey, "ma'ey", is now creeping in.
###770 Erm, we stand at the front of the class
###772 and tell the children what to do all day.
###774 I think they realise we're not all the same.
###777 And then there's the problem that Miss suggests
###780 all female teachers are unmarried girls
###783 and Sir that male teachers all carry a natural authority.
###786 Oh, yes, well, God forbid.
###792 So... I trust we'll hear no more of this.
###796 Erm, no. I'm afraid, as a body of, erm, teachers,
###800 we feel quite strongly that the children should...
###803 I see. And that... is the final view...
###808 of your body?
###812 Mm.
###814 Well, this is an important matter
###817 and I've no choice but to call an emergency meeting of the school governors.
###826 Will you leave, please?
###836 It's good, isn't it? Three days without alcohol,
###839 that shows I've got the willpower of... of an ox.
###841 At least an ox.
###843 It just shows you, when you're in that state, how pivotal drink is.
###846 It's the great, moist crutch that's propping up the sick body of British society.
###851 Would you mind not mentioning moist crutches with my family?
###854 The only question is, how come I feel like total shit?
###857 ñ It's all the toxins coming out. ñ That's all I need.
###860 Show me your tongue. It should be all furry.
###863 Ugh! (Laughing) That's disgusting!
###865 ñ (Angrily) Oh, piss off! ñ Uhñuhñuh.
###868 I'm sorry, the strain is enormous. I'm sorry I'm being irritable.
###872 ñ It's good, isn't it? ñ Mm. Isn't the problem
###874 that there's an insufficient client base to support a photographer,
###878 so you're ultimately doomed?
###880 ñ Doomed. ñ Doomed.
###882 Doomed.
###884 If you'll just excuse me, I'm going to get a drink.
###887 No, lan, we're all being very supportive.
###890 Yes, we're all very proud of you.
###892 Can I change my pledge to drinking in moderation?
###894 ñ No, you can't. ñ Helen, draw the curtains.
###897 Oh, yes, OK. Hang on. Right.
###900 ñ Erm, OK, so, hello, everyone. Hello? ñ Hello!
###903 We're gathered here this evening
###905 to celebrate me finally having put up curtains throughout my house. Yey!
###910 ñ Hooray. ñ I know. It's taken seven years.
###912 And this is the last curtain, which I am now going to solemnly draw across.
###917 Oh, no, lan, you do it, as the latest arrival in the family.
###920 ñ Oh, no, I couldn't possibly. ñ Do it.
###923 ñ Go on. ñ I'll just... do it.
###925 ñ Yay! ñ Whoo!
###930 ñ Super pattern, darling. Super pattern. ñ Lovely.
###933 ñ Yeah, but not the right colour. ñ Oh, course it's the right colour. It is.
###937 I've made a terrible mistake and I feel sick.
###949 Come on. Come on.
###951 It's OK, come on. Come on.
###953 It's OK.
###971 ñ The usual, please. ñ No, I'm sorry.
###975 ñ Hm? ñ You told me to refuse to serve you alcohol.
###978 Oh, the pledge? Oh, right.
###980 That's changed from, you know, to drinking in moderation.
###983 ñ You said, "Don't ever listen to me." ñ Not never ever.
###994 ñ It's a whole... lan. ñ Hi.
###996 ñ lñlñan! ñ lñlñan!
###999 ñ Hi. ñ Hello.
###1001 John, will you buy me a pint, please?
###1003 ñ No. You said you'd never ever... ñ I know what I said.
###1007 This is a test, isn't it?
###1009 Will anybody please... Will anybody...
###1020 ñ Can I have 15 portions of sherry trifle, please? ñ No.
###1025 ñ Give me a grapefruit juice. ñ Pink or regular?
###1028 I don't give a toss.
###1029 God, have a drink! If you need one so much.
###1032 I don't need it! I don't care!
###1034 Anyway, you've drank the house dry.
###1037 Just think what it says about us if you can't survive without a drink down here.
###1054 ñ Hi. ñ lan.
###1056 ñ Hi. ñ Peter. Hi. How are you two?
###1058 ñ Ooh, very well. How are you, lan? ñ Oh, I'm OK. You know.
###1062 I'm OK.
###1065 ñ How did Louis get over his leg? ñ Oh, very well, thanks.
###1068 Fortunately, it turned out to be a twist.
###1070 Oh, right. I'll just take one of these. A twist, eh? That's good.
###1073 I'm sorry, lan. No.
###1075 What?
###1076 I'm sorry, but if a medical practitioner or a customer himself
###1080 asks us not to serve someone, then we do like to stick to that.
###1085 But you're an offñlicence.
###1087 I mean, I could accuse you of... hypocrisy.
###1090 Oh, well.
###1095 It's for my Uncle Teddy.
###1099 He's got this, er, blood alcohol thing.
###1102 He needs to have the right ratio, otherwise he can't breathe through his nose.
###1113 I'm not an alcoholic. That's obviously what people think.
###1117 Well, but I must... I should be... I should be an alcoholic down here.
###1120 In the great nothingness. But I'm not.
###1123 But if somebody tells me I can't have something or, "You can't do it,"
###1127 I think, "Well, I want it, I'll have it" and "I will do it."
###1130 That's why I... That's why I only lasted eight minutes as a vegetarian.
###1135 But the implications, as well. Personal freedom.
###1138 Cos if you say to somebody, "You can't change your mind,"
###1141 that means that it becomes... It's all like, you know...
###1144 And 1984. Rolled into one.
###1147 Is there a choice of background?
###1149 Uh?
###1155 You know, er, actually, I was wondering, could I, er... Very quickly, cos my wife is...
###1160 Could I, er, just to nip into Penfold. Could I borrow your car?
###1163 No, I have to do the shopping.
###1166 Right. Shopping. Right.
###1178 Three... On Tuesdays and Saturdays! I don't believe it.
###1181 Shit!
###1186 # Fifteen barrels of cold water #
###1195 ñ Oh. ñ Er, sorry. I move rather quietly.
###1200 Headmaster.
###1202 I... I wanted to have a chat about tonight's governors' meeting.
###1205 I'm distressed to find myself isolated on this issue.
###1210 As my father, governor Yardley, always says, "You must be doing something right
###1214 "if nobody agrees with anything you say or do."
###1218 Don't get frustrated, Carl. Remember what we talked about.
###1221 Yes. Yes, your fa... He's very...
###1225 But perhaps we should talk about... awe.
###1228 Or... what?
###1231 Er, wonderment, awe. Which I regard as a good thing.
###1235 It seems to me that awe drives everything that's good about the world.
###1239 We need awe to, er... to love people, to look up to our heroes
###1244 or to change the world. And awe is now under attack.
###1247 It's being replaced by indifference, stupor, blind tolerance and cool.
###1253 I suppose this is my point. This is my point.
###1256 If a pupil loses his, er or her, erm... awe for their teacher,
###1262 albeit mixed up with other emotions,
###1264 er, learning and selfñcontrol break down.
###1267 So you think that the children would have more awe for me
###1270 if they called me Miss, then?
###1272 No, I...
###1275 Look, if Miss is a stumbling block
###1277 I'd be prepared to compromise on Mrs Lyons.
###1279 I'm sure Mr Few and Mrs Deacon wouldn't mind
###1282 and then we could avoid this meeting.
###1284 No, I don't think that would be fair.
###1290 Fine.
###1291 I'm coming tonight, by the way.
###1294 That's... not normal.
###1297 Oh, well.
###1300 Top shelf.
###1304 I'm sorry I've been away.
###1306 I meant to call. But I'm back now.
###1311 And another one.
###1313 Another one. For the little boy who lives down the lane.
###1316 And... something for the plants.
###1321 No, I can't carry that for four bloody miles.
###1325 No, I'll eat them.
###1334 Hi.
###1345 That would have been really annoying.
###1347 I'm sorry, mate. You're on my board.
###1350 What?
###1352 "Do not serve this man alcohol."
###1358 D'you still want the biscuits, though?
###1367 (Coin rattling)
###1371 (Groaning)
###1374 Why do I have to eat the whole packet? Why does he eat the whole packet?
###1378 Stay away from me.
###1381 (Shouting)
###1384 ñ Give me an A! ñ A!
###1386 ñ Give me an A! ñ A!
###1391 So what brings you out and about, then, nature boy?
###1394 I went to get a drink and my photograph is in the pub and the offñlicence.
###1401 Are you suggesting it was us?
###1403 ñ Well, it was, wasn't it? ñ Yeah. So?
###1410 Here, lan... Look, don't take it so bad, mate.
###1414 We're only trying to help you to help yourself.
###1416 We're like your personal trainers, your liver police.
###1419 Dean, just go away. You're making me feel more sober.
###1422 No! No, I won't. No.
###1425 And I'll tell you why not.
###1427 Because I've got something at home which will help ease your pain.
###1433 Without interfering with your solemn and binding pledge.
###1438 I've got a school governors' meeting.
###1440 No, no. Lan, this is far more important.
###1442 Now... some people make these into tea.
###1447 Some people cook 'em up in an omelette.
###1450 But me, I... I just chew 'em.
###1454 Because, well, that's me, I suppose.
###1456 I don't know, Dean. I'm a bit nervous.
###1459 Don't be nervous. Look, it's mushroom. It's a growing thing.
###1463 Everything that grows is good.
###1466 So, erm, how did the, er...
###1470 grand opening of the curtains go, then?
###1473 ñ Fine. If you like that kind of thing. ñ Yeah.
###1477 Why don't you go to any of those family dos?
###1480 Dunno, really. I suppose because I sense I don't really belong.
###1485 I mean, I'm the youngest.
###1488 In a lot of ways I'm, you know, regarded as the runt of the family.
###1493 ñ But a big runt, you know? ñ Mm. You are. You're a big runt.
###1499 ñ Yeah. Yeah, a big runt. ñ A big runt.
###1502 ñ A big runt. ñ A really big... runt.
###1507 ñ (lan, smacking lips) Very nibbly, aren't they? ñ Mm.
###1511 ñ (Dean) In a sort of chicken kind of way. ñ Mm.
###1514 (lan) Fingerñlickin', mindñwarping good.
###1517 Well, I should declare an interest in that Lisa is my daughter. Obviously.
###1522 And if she says this change is benefiting the children,
###1526 that's good enough for me.
###1528 Fine. Naked nepotism was ne'er so charmingly expressed.
###1534 Nevertheless, we are here to reach a balanced judgment...
###1537 ñ (Twanging, jingling) ñ... on this situation.
###1540 Look what I found in the hall.
###1544 Just lying there.
###1546 Sorry I'm late. Carry on.
###1548 Been having mushrooms with Dean.
###1550 ñ My own... ñ Totally clean. Nothing to drink.
###1553 ñ Sorry, carry on. ñ (Chiming)
###1556 My own view is that school should be a preparation for life.
###1561 And we live in a formal society,
###1565 so school should reflect that formality. Oh...
###1570 I didn't understand a word of that. Did you?
###1572 What? Oh, no. Good point. Good point. Good point.
###1575 It's very complex. Like those pictures in the hall, the ones we should have in here,
###1580 ñ the purple beetle and... ñ Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
###1584 (Clears throat) We've been discussing this now for quite a long time and...
###1589 we're all, to a greater or a lesser extent, tired!
###1593 So hands up those in favour of the traditional form of address.
###1599 ñ Two, three, four. ñ Look at the pictures, look at the pictures.
###1602 Those in favour of the new way, hands up.
###1607 ...three, four. Four each.
###1610 Mr Lyons, you have the casting vote.
###1612 ñ Is it me? ñ It's you.
###1614 I've listened to the ebb and flow, back and forth, here we are again.
###1618 What'll we do? I don't know.
###1620 ñ But nobody's mentioned this echo. ñ (Footsteps echoing)
###1623 Amazing. It's actually better if there's some background noise. You be a hen.
###1627 You be a hen and I'll go over there.
###1630 ñ Be a hen. ñ (Clucks)
###1632 ñ Yeah. And I'll go over here and do the... ñ Stop this.
###1636 Not you. The lady with the moving hair.
###1638 ñ Stop this! ñ That's another very good point.
###1641 So it's me again, is it? Ebb and flow and all that.
###1644 OK. Well, I happen to think that children are people.
###1648 I think. Smaller. Much smaller.
###1650 Little trousers, little voices, but still people.
###1653 They should be allowed to call anybody by their given name, whatever that is.
###1657 In this case, it's Honor and Lisa and... the man. What's his name again?
###1661 ñ Derek. ñ Oh, yeah.
###1663 I mean, am I right? Astley? Astle? Assles?
###1666 Yes.
###1667 ñ See? ñ I'm afraid... I don't think you are.
###1672 Oh. Well, that's the way I'm voting, they're the votes from the Irish jury, so stuff you.
###1676 Oh...
###1680 That's it. Good evening.
