###22 MALE SPEAKER: Get in the hold now.
###24 Get in the hold now.
###26 Get in the hold now.
###27 Whoa!
###27 Come on.
###28 Come on.
###30 Turn around.
###31 EARL TSOSIE, JR: When we get to rodeos now, we meet people.
###33 And that's when we have our time, we meet a lot of people.
###37 We have our own ways of making a living, like this.
###43 The triple B, that's a good association triple B, they're
###46 giving back to us.
###47 A lot of these associations, they'll take you to
###50 the finals and stuff.
###50 But the amount of money is sometimes not there.
###55 This is you and the animal, you and the horse that's
###58 inside that chute.
###60 Out during the ride when you're going at it to the
###62 eight seconds, you know.
###64 You don't hear much, you just see the horse going at it and
###67 you doing your part.
###69 That's just how it goes.
###71 
###96 And you just get off the pick-up man.
###98 And that's when you just tip your hat to the crowd like
###103 thank you, guys.
###106 I just got up, I ran.
###109 Walking back, I'm talking to myself like you're
###111 going to win today.
###112 Like, this is your day.
###113 I feel it already, that's why I woke up.
###116 I was like OK, I'm going to get here, I'm going to get me
###118 a good horse and I'm going to win.
###120 And it turned out my way.
###123 I'm pretty happy.
###125 I've got some money in my pocket and
###127 another belt buckle.
###128 And it bumped me up in the standings.
###130 And this rodeo's pretty good.
###131 I've been here last year and I won it.
###133 That's all there is to do out there.
###135 There's no mall, no movie theater out there, so you got
###139 to find something to do.
###140 But it keeps you busy.
###141 The weekend flies by fast and pretty soon the rodeo again.
###146 
###151 BERT JONES: I started at a young age with just having
###154 practice bulls.
###154 And then getting interested in buying bucking bulls.
###161 All right, now we're just going to load up the bulls.
###164 
###170 So I've been in the bucking bull business
###173 for about 10 years.
###176 And the bull run part maybe ever since I was
###179 12, so about 16 years.
###182 Yeah, we're going to hook up the trailer and then we'll
###186 chase the bulls into a pen right here.
###189 And then we'll back up the trailer right there and then
###193 load up the bulls.
###194 
###210 CORY ROSE CHEE: If I have homework or
###211 anything, I won't ride.
###213 I get my homework done first.
###214 My mom always tells me school comes first.
###217 You can always rodeo, there's always another rodeo.
###219 And if I want to go to a rodeo and I have a class, she says
###221 Cory Rose, go to class.
###224 It's usually on the weekends.
###225 Usually Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays are when the
###227 rodeos take place.
###229 I compete with whatever.
###231 I enjoy competing with men though.
###233 It's a rush, an adrenaline rush.
###235 Not many women can do it.
###237 That's my strongest event, team roping.
###238 And barrel racing, I'm not really interested.
###240 But my mom pushes me for the all-around.
###241 
###247 Good boy.
###250 Usually when I'm up here, I just let him come up and sit
###253 and just look at the barrels.
###254 And then you'll notice that his ears--
###256 he'll tell you when he's ready.
###257 When you're ready, he'll know when you're ready.
###259 You can just see by his ears, one of his ears will be down
###261 and one will be looking towards that first barrel.
###263 Or both of them will be up , looking at that barrel, and
###265 that's when he's ready to go.
###266 It's hard to rodeo and pay for entry fees.
###268 It's hard to find sponsors because
###270 they're in the same situation.
###273 Usually when you win you roll your money.
###275 You roll it.
###275 If you win, that's real good.
###277 And if you lose, you're shit out of luck.
###280 Yeah, we suffer for a while, and then you have to find your
###283 own way home or anything, food-wise and your horse.
###285 And if you win, you'll just keep going.
###287 LENA MITIS CHEE: Going down.
###290 Go ahead and cut the white one, too.
###294 Come down the back side, right here.
###297 Easy, pull it up, back further, and then
###300 just slide on down.
###302 She doctors with me a little bit, but she's still learning.
###305 So I'm constantly riding her all the time about my way's
###309 the right way.
###312 CORY ROSE CHEE: My mom, she beads.
###314 She'll sell her beadwork and everything.
###316 Or it'll end up, my family will try to help out with my
###318 sponsoring and everything.
###320 
###323 LENA MITIS CHEE: With her dad, he ropes a
###325 lot, and he gets her.
###326 He'll throw a rope at that thing 100
###329 times without missing.
###331 We don't keep a lot of trophies.
###333 I mean, we get buckles.
###335 You're looking for buckles and you're looking for saddles,
###338 breastcollars.
###339 Anything that says, hey, I was there and I won.
###342 This is what I got.
###343 And that's what you're looking for when
###344 you're going to rodeo.
###345 Something to show that hey, I'm this good and I can do it.
###348 Bragging rights is what it is.
###351 
###354 EARL TSOSIE, JR: When I was raised up, we were kind of low
###360 on money and trying to help out my mom and everything.
###363 Now we're up there and a lot of people look up to us now.
###365 Back then, they probably were thinking they won't succeed,
###369 you know what I mean?
###369 It's a good thing I joined the rodeo.
###372 Because if I didn't join the rodeo, I don't know what I'd
###374 be doing now.
###374 I'd have probably been doing something crazy with my life.
###379 But no, this really changed me.
###381 So now I just go rodeo full time.
###384 It really gave me a positive attitude and stay up there.
###388 But every rodeo I hit, every weekend.
###390 And I win, I place second, third, and then I get money
###395 from there.
###396 A good rodeo, good weekend, you'll at least walk away for
###398 like maybe two grand.
###399 So it's pretty good every weekend, it's how we pay our
###403 stuff, you know?
###404 I bring these back just to make my mom and
###406 dad proud of me.
###407 Show somebody I can do something.
###410 When we entered, a bunch of riders were probably thinking
###412 like they won't go long.
###415 And now all them riders are ducking and diving for muscle.
###420 But we don't worry about the other riders, we just throw
###423 our stuff on the horse 110%.
###431 CORY ROSE CHEE: When you can't focus, you can't win.
###434 When you're at a rodeo and you're stressed
###435 with all the crap--
###436 I need to win this one.
###437 If I don't win this one I'm out, I can't
###439 get in for next weekend.
###440 
###446 When I'm out roping sometimes, and I'm tired because I just
###449 barely pulled in and it's my turn to rope, I kind of lose
###452 concentration and slack off because I'm so tired.
###454 And I'm stressing like if I don't win, and the what-ifs
###456 and all the maybes and stuff.
###458 But the key to it is practice, practice, practice.
###462 
###467 But rodeo can wait.
###469 School, my boys is taking care of them.
###471 Making sure they're healthy, in shape, well taken care of.
###474 The economy goes bad, I'm not going to sell my horses.
###477 There's no way in heck I'm going to sell my horses.
###479 Take anything else.
###480 Take my car, I could care less.
###481 Just as long as I have my horses.
###482 These are my best friends.
###484 When I have something wrong, I'll go outside and talk to
###486 them, they'll just stand there.
###488 They like to be loved.
###489 But like I said, when it's time to do work, they know
###492 when it is.
###493 Once you get them out, every single day we're riding each
###495 horse about an hour a day.
###497 Bringing them up here, and running barrels.
###499 Roping the dummies, then saddling up.
###500 Roping your dummy off them, then that's
###503 when they're golden.
###504 
###513 EARL TSOSIE, JR: And this is where I was raised.
###515 Where I spend most of my time, here at the horse corral.
###518 Out there riding on the mountains, and herding sheep.
###524 I started in sheep when five years old.
###528 From there I just learned how to ride the horse.
###531 This place is all family owned.
###533 My grandpa's brothers live over there,
###536 so this is all family.
###538 So you can do whatever you want to do.
###541 When I was raised up, my grandpa and grandma used to
###545 just wake me up in the morning.
###546 They used to tell me to go run.
###548 If you really want something you have to go run and beat
###551 the sun up.
###553 So it's kind of like a traditional thing, I guess.
###556 Like, if you run in the morning, that's where all the
###561 good stuff come from.
###563 If you beat the sun, you know you can beat anything.
###567 I just need to get a new motor.
###568 Fix it up a little, this will be my rodeo car.
###572 Get me to some rodeos a lot faster.
###573 
###576 I'm kind of like a rock and roll type of guy.
###580 I listen to country here and there.
###583 But kind of more into a little rock and roll--
###585 it gets me going.
###588 Maybe next year you'll see me cruising
###589 this car to the rodeo.
###591
