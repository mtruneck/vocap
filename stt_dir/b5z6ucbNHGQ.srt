1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:29,29



2
0:0:29,29 --> 0:0:31,74
ANTHONY STRONG: Ironically, I'm
at my happiest when I show


3
0:0:31,74 --> 0:0:36,154
up here at the crack of dawn
after leaving work at 1:00,


4
0:0:36,154 --> 0:0:37,71
1:30 in the morning.


5
0:0:37,71 --> 0:0:41,59
And I'm in the kitchen and I'm
surrounding by all my cooks


6
0:0:41,59 --> 0:0:43,186
and all the food.


7
0:0:43,186 --> 0:0:47,56
And we have a list a mile long
to get through, problems,


8
0:0:47,56 --> 0:0:48,98
around every corner.


9
0:0:48,98 --> 0:0:52,41
It is so much fun to attack
something like that.


10
0:0:52,41 --> 0:0:53,81
It's such a beautiful process.


11
0:0:53,81 --> 0:0:58,61



12
0:0:58,61 --> 0:1:0,24
My name is Anthony Strong.


13
0:1:0,24 --> 0:1:3,51
I'm the executive chef for
Locanda Osteria and Bar, in


14
0:1:3,51 --> 0:1:4,76
San Francisco, in the Mission.


15
0:1:4,76 --> 0:1:7,71



16
0:1:7,71 --> 0:1:10,88
I guess my interest in food
started when I was a kid


17
0:1:10,88 --> 0:1:12,86
growing up in Iowa.


18
0:1:12,86 --> 0:1:15,3
And I'd weed my grandmother's
tomato garden.


19
0:1:15,3 --> 0:1:20,65
And then she'd make me BLTs with
bacon made at the Dubuque


20
0:1:20,65 --> 0:1:23,62
meat packing company nearby,
where the whole family worked


21
0:1:23,62 --> 0:1:24,36
at some point.


22
0:1:24,36 --> 0:1:27,75
I moved to New York, worked at
Le Bernardin, and then moved


23
0:1:27,75 --> 0:1:31,74
out here because I just really,
really wanted to cook


24
0:1:31,74 --> 0:1:32,66
in San Francisco.


25
0:1:32,66 --> 0:1:33,875
I just fell in love with it.


26
0:1:33,875 --> 0:1:37,86
It was exactly everything
I was looking for.


27
0:1:37,86 --> 0:1:40,55
As a cook, I think it's
important to have a certain


28
0:1:40,55 --> 0:1:43,27
set of parameters that are
guiding your cooking.


29
0:1:43,27 --> 0:1:47,58
We're trying to give a Roman
restaurant and food experience


30
0:1:47,58 --> 0:1:49,48
through the lens of
the Bay Area--


31
0:1:49,48 --> 0:1:52,48
slightly interpreting dishes,
but really making it feel


32
0:1:52,48 --> 0:1:53,855
Roman to the core.


33
0:1:53,855 --> 0:2:2,58



34
0:2:2,58 --> 0:2:4,98
Last night, we went out to Lers
Ros, which is my favorite


35
0:2:4,98 --> 0:2:6,34
Thai food in the city.


36
0:2:6,34 --> 0:2:8,46
Do want to meet us there,
or should I swing by


37
0:2:8,46 --> 0:2:9,139
and pick you up?


38
0:2:9,139 --> 0:2:13,24
My conundrum with Lers Ros is
that the menu is so huge, and


39
0:2:13,24 --> 0:2:16,39
I haven't been able to dig all
of the way through it yet


40
0:2:16,39 --> 0:2:19,63
because I keep finding favorite
dishes that I want to


41
0:2:19,63 --> 0:2:23,3
order over and over and over.


42
0:2:23,3 --> 0:2:24,55
Sweet.


43
0:2:24,55 --> 0:2:27,22



44
0:2:27,22 --> 0:2:32,712
So far, we've got deep-fried
quail in garlic sauce.


45
0:2:32,712 --> 0:2:37,37
We've got grilled pork shoulder,
and we've got


46
0:2:37,37 --> 0:2:41,934
chilled duck salad with lime
and peppercorn dressing.


47
0:2:41,934 --> 0:2:47,2
And spicy and sour soup soup,
with pork spare ribs.


48
0:2:47,2 --> 0:2:47,99
KAREN ROGERS: No.


49
0:2:47,99 --> 0:2:50,82
ANTHONY STRONG: This
is so good.


50
0:2:50,82 --> 0:2:51,973
And they chopped the thing
up, deep fried it.


51
0:2:51,973 --> 0:2:54,56
KAREN ROGERS: And we're all
having some of it, right?


52
0:2:54,56 --> 0:2:55,823
ANTHONY STRONG: Oh, yeah.


53
0:2:55,823 --> 0:2:57,9
KAREN ROGERS: This one.


54
0:2:57,9 --> 0:2:58,27
ANTHONY STRONG: Guys, I'd
like to introduce


55
0:2:58,27 --> 0:3:0,879
everybody to Caleb.


56
0:3:0,879 --> 0:3:2,33
[LAUGHTER]


57
0:3:2,33 --> 0:3:5,6
ANTHONY STRONG: Caleb is the
gentlemen lovingly drinking


58
0:3:5,6 --> 0:3:8,2
soup broth out of the spoon.


59
0:3:8,2 --> 0:3:9,27
CALEB ZIGAS: This is awesome.


60
0:3:9,27 --> 0:3:11,98
ANTHONY STRONG: Caleb
runs La Cocina.


61
0:3:11,98 --> 0:3:15,69
They are some of the
biggest heroes of


62
0:3:15,69 --> 0:3:17,71
the local food scene.


63
0:3:17,71 --> 0:3:21,38
It's a non-profit business
incubator, basically, geared


64
0:3:21,38 --> 0:3:23,31
towards Mexican women.


65
0:3:23,31 --> 0:3:29,64
And basically, they start food
businesses with their clients,


66
0:3:29,64 --> 0:3:35,25
rent out kitchen space, and give
them all the guidance and


67
0:3:35,25 --> 0:3:41,1
infrastructure and assistance
that they need to start their


68
0:3:41,1 --> 0:3:47,6
cookie shop, taco truck,
restaurant, catering business.


69
0:3:47,6 --> 0:3:50,26



70
0:3:50,26 --> 0:3:55,22
La Cocina has given
birth to so many


71
0:3:55,22 --> 0:3:57,66
businesses in the Bay Area.


72
0:3:57,66 --> 0:3:59,75
And they are very
important to us.


73
0:3:59,75 --> 0:4:1,33
CALEB ZIGAS: San Francisco has
a customer base that wants


74
0:4:1,33 --> 0:4:3,4
that kind of authentic food.


75
0:4:3,4 --> 0:4:5,14
And that we've been lucky
enough to find really


76
0:4:5,14 --> 0:4:8,41
talented, driven women who can
bring that kind of food in a


77
0:4:8,41 --> 0:4:8,66
way that people want.


78
0:4:8,66 --> 0:4:10,78
So, I think San Francisco's
a place for it to start.


79
0:4:10,78 --> 0:4:12,18
I think it has a lot
of meaning here.


80
0:4:12,18 --> 0:4:14,194
And I think there are other
places where it would make a


81
0:4:14,194 --> 0:4:14,85
lot of sense, too.


82
0:4:14,85 --> 0:4:15,7
ANTHONY STRONG: And they're
some of the best


83
0:4:15,7 --> 0:4:17,14
cooks I've ever met--


84
0:4:17,14 --> 0:4:17,54
CALEB ZIGAS: The best.


85
0:4:17,54 --> 0:4:18,79
ANTHONY STRONG: --in my life.


86
0:4:18,79 --> 0:4:22,66



87
0:4:22,66 --> 0:4:26,48
We are going to Suppenkuche,
the most badass German food


88
0:4:26,48 --> 0:4:28,365
and beer in the city.


89
0:4:28,365 --> 0:4:33,15



90
0:4:33,15 --> 0:4:37,22
The one thing that I miss about
New York, and I crave in


91
0:4:37,22 --> 0:4:40,11
San Francisco, is late-night
dining.


92
0:4:40,11 --> 0:4:42,22
I love late-night
dining scenes.


93
0:4:42,22 --> 0:4:45,7
I love having a bunch of cooks,
restaurant people, from


94
0:4:45,7 --> 0:4:49,529
around the city coming in and
digging the food and drinking


95
0:4:49,529 --> 0:4:50,99
and having a good time.


96
0:4:50,99 --> 0:4:54,27
So we've got weinerschnitzel
and roasted potatoes.


97
0:4:54,27 --> 0:4:57,73
And then over here, we've got
jaegerschnitzel, which is a


98
0:4:57,73 --> 0:5:1,56
weinerschnitzel covered in
mushroom gravy with spaetzle.


99
0:5:1,56 --> 0:5:4,89
We have this, which is already
kind of destroyed.


100
0:5:4,89 --> 0:5:9,71
It's their house-made pretzle,
with this insanely dense


101
0:5:9,71 --> 0:5:11,88
cheese stuff.


102
0:5:11,88 --> 0:5:13,65
I don't really know
what that is.


103
0:5:13,65 --> 0:5:17,77
But it's absolutely incredible
with beer, sausages and mash,


104
0:5:17,77 --> 0:5:20,66
and grilled lamb chops.


105
0:5:20,66 --> 0:5:22,16
RUSSEL OLSON: [INAUDIBLE]


106
0:5:22,16 --> 0:5:23,41
ANTHONY STRONG: Thank
you, sir.


107
0:5:23,41 --> 0:5:25,604



108
0:5:25,604 --> 0:5:28,74
ANTHONY STRONG: Now say "prost"
and make eye contact.


109
0:5:28,74 --> 0:5:29,728
KAREN ROGERS: Prost.


110
0:5:29,728 --> 0:5:30,716
ANTHONY STRONG: Prost


111
0:5:30,716 --> 0:5:31,704
ASHLEY BELLVIEW: Prost.


112
0:5:31,704 --> 0:5:33,186
MALE SPEAKER 1: Prost.


113
0:5:33,186 --> 0:5:34,436
MALE SPEAKER 2: Prost.


114
0:5:34,436 --> 0:5:38,14



115
0:5:38,14 --> 0:5:39,28
ANTHONY STRONG: I love
San Francisco.


116
0:5:39,28 --> 0:5:40,9
It's a great place
to be a cook.


117
0:5:40,9 --> 0:5:41,31
I love it.


118
0:5:41,31 --> 0:5:45,66
We just basically survive on
vegetables and hippy love.


119
0:5:45,66 --> 0:5:48,578
We have drum circles pretty
much every night.


120
0:5:48,578 --> 0:5:50,53
ZACK SWELME: We have to
before a service.


121
0:5:50,53 --> 0:5:51,66
ANTHONY STRONG: And that's
what San Francisco


122
0:5:51,66 --> 0:5:52,91
is really all about.


123
0:5:52,91 --> 0:5:54,28
It's great.


124
0:5:54,28 --> 0:5:56,935
What I love about being a cook
in San Francisco is that


125
0:5:56,935 --> 0:6:1,35
there's such a great
democratization of the food


126
0:6:1,35 --> 0:6:2,94
culture here, and the
food community.


127
0:6:2,94 --> 0:6:7,92
You're able to get an insane
tasting menu, beautifully,


128
0:6:7,92 --> 0:6:11,57
beautifully prepared
multi-course dinners, and then


129
0:6:11,57 --> 0:6:15,5
you can walk two blocks away and
get one of the best tacos


130
0:6:15,5 --> 0:6:19,88
of your life for $2, or a
burrito that's the size of


131
0:6:19,88 --> 0:6:25,7
your arm, and it is absolutely
delicious, and made by people


132
0:6:25,7 --> 0:6:26,48
who are loving what they do.


133
0:6:26,48 --> 0:6:29,3



134
0:6:29,3 --> 0:6:32,7
We're going to Locanda, in the
Mission, the restaurant that,


135
0:6:32,7 --> 0:6:34,4
apparently, I run.


136
0:6:34,4 --> 0:6:36,62
We're going to make BLTs
because I want a BLT.


137
0:6:36,62 --> 0:6:37,84
Is that cool?


138
0:6:37,84 --> 0:6:39,172
Hey, welcome to Locanda.


139
0:6:39,172 --> 0:6:40,618
KAREN ROGERS: [LAUGH]


140
0:6:40,618 --> 0:6:48,51



141
0:6:48,51 --> 0:6:51,23
ANTHONY STRONG: BLTs
a la Locanda.


142
0:6:51,23 --> 0:6:54,68
Being a kid from the Midwest
and a very working-class


143
0:6:54,68 --> 0:6:57,67
background, I've never
really believed in


144
0:6:57,67 --> 0:6:59,79
anything like luck.


145
0:6:59,79 --> 0:7:2,202
It's always been very important
to me from the start


146
0:7:2,202 --> 0:7:6,5
to pound the pavement
and pay dues.


147
0:7:6,5 --> 0:7:9,86
And I've always believed that
the harder you work, the more


148
0:7:9,86 --> 0:7:12,6
luck you have.


149
0:7:12,6 --> 0:7:13,31
Create your own luck.


150
0:7:13,31 --> 0:7:16,2



151
0:7:16,2 --> 0:7:19,39
In the restaurant and cooking
world, it's cool that there's


152
0:7:19,39 --> 0:7:22,1
space for so many of us.


153
0:7:22,1 --> 0:7:23,71
And we can all be
so different.


154
0:7:23,71 --> 0:7:26,75
I love the fact that there are
people that are great at being


155
0:7:26,75 --> 0:7:31,74
on TV, and looking and talking
great, and shooting from the


156
0:7:31,74 --> 0:7:33,97
hip with the question
and answer thing.


157
0:7:33,97 --> 0:7:38,21
And I love and respect
those people.


158
0:7:38,21 --> 0:7:42,23
And I also am really
appreciative of the fact that


159
0:7:42,23 --> 0:7:46,77
there's space for guys like me
that are just really good at


160
0:7:46,77 --> 0:7:49,31
getting underneath the
dishwasher during a Friday


161
0:7:49,31 --> 0:7:51,74
night service and fixing it.


162
0:7:51,74 --> 0:7:53,6
[LAUGH]


163
0:7:53,6 --> 0:7:57,55
I'm definitely invigorated by
how competitive and ruthless


164
0:7:57,55 --> 0:8:2,44
the restaurant industry is, and
how tough it is to make a


165
0:8:2,44 --> 0:8:5,38
plate of pasta happen
on somebody's plate.


166
0:8:5,38 --> 0:8:9,79
And then how tough it is
to make a buck on it.


167
0:8:9,79 --> 0:8:10,78
It's a blast.


168
0:8:10,78 --> 0:8:12,48
It's a constant challenge.


169
0:8:12,48 --> 0:8:14,23
And I wouldn't trade
it for anything.


170
0:8:14,23 --> 0:10:14,23
