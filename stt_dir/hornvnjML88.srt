1
0:0:15,694 --> 0:0:42,65
The following program is brought
to you in living color on NBC.


2
0:0:42,65 --> 0:0:46,3
Captain's log, stardate 6031.2


3
0:0:46,3 --> 0:0:48,701
We are in standard orbit above
the neutral planetoid Babel,


4
0:0:48,701 --> 0:0:51,63
awaiting the beaming aboard
of Federation ambassadors


5
0:0:51,63 --> 0:0:54,661
who have been attending a
crucial economic conference.


6
0:0:54,661 --> 0:0:59,976
One ambassador, however, prefers
an older form of transport....


7
0:0:59,976 --> 0:1:4,147
- You must think I'm hopelessly old fashioned.
- Ma'am?


8
0:1:4,147 --> 0:1:9,724
Well to prefer traveling by shuttle, rather than
having my atoms shooting through space.


9
0:1:9,724 --> 0:1:13,145
I always found that, a very unsettling concept.


10
0:1:13,145 --> 0:1:15,184
Our ship’s doctor agrees with you.


11
0:1:15,184 --> 0:1:18,244
He's a sensible man.


12
0:1:18,244 --> 0:1:23,637
You know, you remind me so much
of someone I knew a long time ago.


13
0:1:23,637 --> 0:1:27,28
Would that be because I resemble my
grandfather -- Dimitri Chekov.


14
0:1:27,28 --> 0:1:29,609
Federation ambassador to Russia.


15
0:1:29,609 --> 0:1:33,141
You mean "from Earth."
Of course...


16
0:1:33,141 --> 0:1:37,934
I knew him as ambassador when I
first went into service for Obsidia.


17
0:1:37,934 --> 0:1:40,585
I liked him very much.


18
0:1:40,585 --> 0:1:45,39
He liked you. He told me so. Many times.


19
0:1:45,39 --> 0:1:50,694
Did he?


20
0:1:50,694 --> 0:1:52,692
Many times?


21
0:1:52,692 --> 0:2:3,585
Yes, ma'am.


22
0:2:3,585 --> 0:2:7,92
[Warning tone]


23
0:2:7,92 --> 0:2:23,699
What the hell?


24
0:2:23,699 --> 0:2:24,714
What are you doing?


25
0:2:24,714 --> 0:2:29,233
Buying time. That debris field might camouflage
our image. He won’t know what to target.


26
0:2:29,233 --> 0:2:30,657
Target?!


27
0:2:30,657 --> 0:2:56,678
His disrupters are armed.


28
0:2:56,678 --> 0:3:31,718
Hold on. I’m going to try something....


29
0:3:31,718 --> 0:3:40,75
Space, the final frontier.


30
0:3:40,75 --> 0:3:43,995
These are the new voyages of the Starship Enterprise,


31
0:3:43,995 --> 0:3:48,654
Its five year mission to
explore strange new worlds


32
0:3:48,654 --> 0:3:52,67
To seek out new life and new civilizations.


33
0:3:52,67 --> 0:4:57,466
To boldly go where no man has gone before.


34
0:4:57,466 --> 0:5:23,24
- Oh My.
- Yes, Ma'am.


35
0:5:23,24 --> 0:5:33,738
Klingon vessel, stand down
or be fired upon!


36
0:5:33,738 --> 0:5:35,101
That was exciting.


37
0:5:35,101 --> 0:5:56,15
Sorry. I hadn’t planned
on any entertainment.


38
0:5:56,15 --> 0:5:59,131
Captain, the Klingon is signaling us.


39
0:5:59,131 --> 0:6:2,651
He identifies himself as
the Dark Destroyer.


40
0:6:2,651 --> 0:6:8,635
- On screen, Lieutenant.
- Aye, sir.


41
0:6:8,635 --> 0:6:12,757
Well, well, well. Lost a little
something, have you, Kirk?


42
0:6:12,757 --> 0:6:14,97
Our sensors had the Shuttle at all times.


43
0:6:14,97 --> 0:6:19,853
But it’s...thoughtful of you to enter neutral
space to see about it. Now get gone.


44
0:6:19,853 --> 0:6:25,464
Ah, but it is neutral space. You have
no authority to order me out.


45
0:6:25,464 --> 0:6:31,75
I just came by to offer a friendly greeting...
get in a little target practice.


46
0:6:31,75 --> 0:6:34,14
If you were friendly, you wouldn’t
have come in cloaked.


47
0:6:34,14 --> 0:6:38,2
We have been visiting quite a few
of your Federation planets lately,


48
0:6:38,2 --> 0:6:41,132
the ones that have failed
and been abandoned.


49
0:6:41,132 --> 0:6:45,423
They make very nice -- and easy --
additions to the Klingon Empire.


50
0:6:45,423 --> 0:6:49,22
Kargh, get out of here before
I run you out under escort.


51
0:6:49,22 --> 0:6:51,702
Mr. DeSalle - Phasers?


52
0:6:51,702 --> 0:6:54,177
Hot and locked on the Klingon.


53
0:6:54,177 --> 0:6:55,692
You hear that, Captain?


54
0:6:55,692 --> 0:7:4,479
I am sure we will see you again, Kirk
-- as our Empire expands.


55
0:7:4,479 --> 0:7:8,235
I think a welcoming committee for Ambassador
Morgan and Mr. Chekov is in order.


56
0:7:8,235 --> 0:7:10,192
Mr. Spock, Bones, your with me.


57
0:7:10,192 --> 0:7:36,647
- Scotty, you have the conn.
- Aye, sir.


58
0:7:36,647 --> 0:7:41,738
Hanger deck secured.
Hanger deck pressurizing.


59
0:7:41,738 --> 0:7:43,604
That was really quite a ride.


60
0:7:43,604 --> 0:7:46,21
- Permission to come aboard allowed?
- Granted, sir.


61
0:7:46,21 --> 0:7:50,98
- You know, you did a wonderful job.
- Thank you.


62
0:7:50,98 --> 0:8:2,249
This way, Ambassador.


63
0:8:2,249 --> 0:8:5,5
- That was a nice piece of flying, Mr. Chekov.
- Thank you, sir.


64
0:8:5,5 --> 0:8:7,85
Captain James T. Kirk, Ambassador.
Welcome aboard the Enterprise.


65
0:8:7,85 --> 0:8:8,799
Thank you, Captain.


66
0:8:8,799 --> 0:8:10,9
I have to apologize for
that little Klingon incident.


67
0:8:10,9 --> 0:8:17,474
My pilot was very skillful. However, I may
have to consider the transporter, next time.


68
0:8:17,474 --> 0:8:20,312
Allow me to introduce you
to my first officer Mr. Spock


69
0:8:20,312 --> 0:8:21,566
Mr. Spock


70
0:8:21,566 --> 0:8:23,857
- My Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Leonard McCoy.
- Ambassador.


71
0:8:23,857 --> 0:8:26,692
If you were injured, or shaken up
in the shuttle, I'd be happy...


72
0:8:26,692 --> 0:8:28,61
Not at all, Dr. McCoy, I'm fine.


73
0:8:28,61 --> 0:8:32,176
However, I would appreciate
some rest in my quarters.


74
0:8:32,176 --> 0:8:34,118
Permit us to escort you to
your quarters, Ambassador.


75
0:8:34,118 --> 0:8:37,716
Mr. Chekov, take the ship out of orbit
and set a course straight for Earth.


76
0:8:37,716 --> 0:8:41,544
- See you later Pavel.
- Lady Rayna.


77
0:8:41,544 --> 0:8:45,722
Let's go, Pavel.


78
0:8:45,722 --> 0:8:48,3
I was never that young.


79
0:8:48,3 --> 0:8:50,159
I trust the Council sessions went well?


80
0:8:50,159 --> 0:8:53,805
Not at all captain, I’m afraid
we didn't accomplish a thing.


81
0:8:53,805 --> 0:9:16,472
That’s disturbing.


82
0:9:16,472 --> 0:9:20,23
[Rayna] The Federation credits system
is collapsing on planet after planet.


83
0:9:20,23 --> 0:9:22,576
[Kirk] Credits aren’t worth the same
from one planet to the next.


84
0:9:22,576 --> 0:9:25,378
[Spock] Resupplying consumables,
in certain sections of the quadrant,


85
0:9:25,378 --> 0:9:28,23
has become difficult where the value
of the credit has been devalued.


86
0:9:28,23 --> 0:9:32,547
Yes, but it’s more than that. The planets
with viable economies can hold their own.


87
0:9:32,547 --> 0:9:36,802
But others, less fortunate, are falling into
economic ruin and will soon be abandoned.


88
0:9:36,802 --> 0:9:40,237
How well we know that. The Enterprise
has assisted in the evacuation


89
0:9:40,237 --> 0:9:43,5
and relocation of two
Federation colonies, so far.


90
0:9:43,5 --> 0:9:44,636
Really?


91
0:9:44,636 --> 0:9:48,746
The Council debated for over three
months and came up with no solutions.


92
0:9:48,746 --> 0:9:51,916
And we won’t meet again
for another six months.


93
0:9:51,916 --> 0:9:53,51
I am not hopeful.


94
0:9:53,51 --> 0:9:57,85
Our Klingon visitor pointed out abandoned
planets are ripe for the plucking.


95
0:9:57,85 --> 0:9:59,15
Yes, by the Klingons or the Romulans.


96
0:9:59,15 --> 0:10:4,64
So, we have economic Chaos, failing
worlds. We must find a solution.


97
0:10:4,64 --> 0:10:20,256
Otherwise, I’m afraid the Federation
will not exist much longer.


98
0:10:20,256 --> 0:10:35,465
- Mr. Sulu, you are relieved.
- Take good care of her tonight Vincent.


99
0:10:35,465 --> 0:10:37,692
Not a bad piece of flying out there, Chekov.


100
0:10:37,692 --> 0:10:39,989
Thank you.


101
0:10:39,989 --> 0:10:44,197
Considering you’re not rated
for helm as well as navigation


102
0:10:44,197 --> 0:10:46,245
Well, it doesn’t matter in the shuttle.


103
0:10:46,245 --> 0:10:51,246
As I demonstrated.


104
0:10:51,246 --> 0:10:59,567
Still, a double bridge qualification means
more when promotions come up.


105
0:10:59,567 --> 0:11:3,953
DeSalle? What’s your phaser firing rank?


106
0:11:3,953 --> 0:11:9,592
Eighty-five.


107
0:11:9,592 --> 0:11:18,435
Ninety-seven.


108
0:11:18,435 --> 0:11:23,236
- Have fun at Dinner.
- Dinner?


109
0:11:23,236 --> 0:11:20,915
Oh really?


110
0:11:20,915 --> 0:11:25,347
With Ambassador... Rayna?


111
0:11:25,347 --> 0:11:35,55
It's a... just dinner.


112
0:11:35,55 --> 0:11:38,548
Captain. I’m picking up a blip.
It’s pacing us.


113
0:11:38,548 --> 0:11:40,267
Can you make it out?


114
0:11:40,267 --> 0:11:43,73
Could be a ship, but it’s just on the
edge of our long range sensors.


115
0:11:43,73 --> 0:11:46,84
All I got was a flash --
solid but unidentifiable.


116
0:11:46,84 --> 0:11:52,678
I want the sensors set for a constant sweep
around the ship. Under a 24-hour surveillance.


117
0:11:52,678 --> 0:11:55,353
If there's something out there,


118
0:11:55,353 --> 0:12:3,16
I want to know what it is.


119
0:12:3,16 --> 0:12:5,753
he told me all the old Russian
folk tales when I was a boy.


120
0:12:5,753 --> 0:12:10,533
But he set them in outer space.


121
0:12:10,533 --> 0:12:14,46
- On alien planets, of course.
- Of course.


122
0:12:14,46 --> 0:12:18,56
I wanted to visit them all,
so I became a navigator.


123
0:12:18,56 --> 0:12:20,42
Very simple.


124
0:12:20,42 --> 0:12:23,448
Dimitri was an inspiring man, wasn’t he.


125
0:12:23,448 --> 0:12:30,43
Do you know that told he told me when I was just 22,
that I could be the Obsidia System ambassador?


126
0:12:30,43 --> 0:12:36,34
He was always so positive. He said he saw
in me all the possibilities, even then.


127
0:12:36,34 --> 0:12:40,139
He was right. He told me
all about you, you know.


128
0:12:40,139 --> 0:12:43,36
Yes, "many times", you said.


129
0:12:43,36 --> 0:12:47,85
I think he was just a little bit in love.


130
0:12:47,85 --> 0:12:49,98
Was he?


131
0:12:49,98 --> 0:12:52,706
Yes.


132
0:12:52,706 --> 0:12:57,406
You know, this is much too complicated a
subject to be discussing at such a late hour.


133
0:12:57,406 --> 0:13:0,95
Perhaps we could do it
on another occasion?


134
0:13:0,95 --> 0:13:3,89
Tomorrow, dinner?


135
0:13:3,89 --> 0:13:31,496
Done.


136
0:13:31,496 --> 0:13:35,191
Slummin’, lad? Not like you
to come down here for a visit.


137
0:13:35,191 --> 0:13:37,952
The navigation system’s showing
a slight deviation off prime.


138
0:13:37,952 --> 0:13:41,656
It’s only a tenth of a degree, but it’s
increased since I noticed it last shift.


139
0:13:41,656 --> 0:13:44,12
I’ll take a look at it.
But it will have to wait a bit.


140
0:13:44,12 --> 0:13:51,346
We’re having a wee bit of a problem
with the manifold pressure here....


141
0:13:51,346 --> 0:14:9,737
Mr. Scott!


142
0:14:9,737 --> 0:14:10,848
Well?


143
0:14:10,848 --> 0:14:14,22
I don’t see how you could have been
shielded from that radiation burst,


144
0:14:14,22 --> 0:14:17,745
but, there doesn’t seem to be any damage.


145
0:14:17,745 --> 0:14:19,527
Then I can return to duty?


146
0:14:19,527 --> 0:14:22,851
Take this shift off. Go back
to your quarters and relax.


147
0:14:22,851 --> 0:14:24,61
Doctor, I feel fine.


148
0:14:24,61 --> 0:14:29,59
Hey, doctor’s orders. And If you decide to
disobey, remember I can pull you in here


149
0:14:29,59 --> 0:14:35,65
for a complete two-day medical
exam. With probes. Just because.


150
0:14:35,65 --> 0:15:21,11
I think I’ll go back to my quarters... and relax.


151
0:15:21,11 --> 0:15:23,1
Status, Mr. Scott.


152
0:15:23,1 --> 0:15:30,25
Do you want the full report or the summary?


153
0:15:30,25 --> 0:15:32,62
The summary will do.


154
0:15:32,62 --> 0:15:35,511
All right then. We've got one
warp engine, one impulse engine.


155
0:15:35,511 --> 0:15:39,448
Full warp will be impossible and
maneuvering will be clumsy,


156
0:15:39,448 --> 0:15:42,926
but we’re working around the
clock to get us back on line.


157
0:15:42,926 --> 0:15:44,21
How long?


158
0:15:44,21 --> 0:15:46,683
As soon as humanly possible, sir.
Best we can do. [Bridge com sounds]


159
0:15:46,683 --> 0:15:50,412
McCoy to bridge.


160
0:15:50,412 --> 0:15:51,82
Kirk here. What is it, Bones?


161
0:15:51,82 --> 0:15:54,345
Captain, report to Sickbay as soon as
possible.


162
0:15:54,345 --> 0:15:56,4
Can it wait?


163
0:15:56,4 --> 0:15:57,885
Now, Jim.


164
0:15:57,885 --> 0:16:2,1
Alright Doctor, I’m on my way.
Mr. Spock, you have the Bridge.


165
0:16:2,1 --> 0:16:15,59
- Stay on it, Mr. Scott.
- That was my intention, Sir.


166
0:16:15,59 --> 0:16:20,358
This shouldn’t be. I mean he was perfectly
fine on the last scan. Yesterday.


167
0:16:20,358 --> 0:16:24,187
Did you miss anything?


168
0:16:24,187 --> 0:16:25,71
Well then why is this happening?


169
0:16:25,71 --> 0:16:30,732
History. On Gamma Hydra Four, he was exposed,
just as we were, to the aging disease.


170
0:16:30,732 --> 0:16:34,898
Back then a burst of adrenaline allowed
him to escape the full effects, but


171
0:16:34,898 --> 0:16:38,423
obviously his body has been harboring
the disease all this time.


172
0:16:38,423 --> 0:16:40,319
And?


173
0:16:40,319 --> 0:16:45,34
He's suffered a massive radiation dose.
It unleashed the disease and...


174
0:16:45,34 --> 0:16:47,821
now the Hyronaline therapy isn’t working.


175
0:16:47,821 --> 0:16:51,396
Prognosis, Doctor.


176
0:16:51,396 --> 0:16:54,458
He’s aged twenty-five years in one day.


177
0:16:54,458 --> 0:16:56,266
Bones, What can you do?


178
0:16:56,266 --> 0:17:14,146
Nothing, Jim. I can't stop it.


179
0:17:14,146 --> 0:17:17,922
No. This has to be reversible.


180
0:17:17,922 --> 0:17:22,352
The ship’s computers can access all the
medical knowledge the Federation has.


181
0:17:22,352 --> 0:17:25,196
I’ll do my best, Pavel. Count on it.


182
0:17:25,196 --> 0:17:31,4
That’s not good enough. You have to
find a cure. There has to be one.


183
0:17:31,4 --> 0:17:32,615
If there isn’t....


184
0:17:32,615 --> 0:17:34,548
You always have an answer.


185
0:17:34,548 --> 0:17:41,173
Lieutenant, maybe you'd better think about
putting a few things in order. Just in case....


186
0:17:41,173 --> 0:17:43,9
I won’t have to.


187
0:17:43,9 --> 0:17:45,615
I’ll report to my station now.


188
0:17:45,615 --> 0:17:49,35
Mr. Chekov, in your condition, I think
it's best that you remain here in sick bay.


189
0:17:49,35 --> 0:17:53,37
Unless, if Dr. McCoy thinks it's all right,
you may return to your quarters.


190
0:17:53,37 --> 0:18:2,5
But I feel fine!


191
0:18:2,5 --> 0:18:4,687
Captain,


192
0:18:4,687 --> 0:18:11,85
I’m picking up that anomaly again. Stronger now.
I’m definitely reading it as another ship.


193
0:18:11,85 --> 0:18:12,514
Spock - configuration?


194
0:18:12,514 --> 0:18:18,199
I cannot make it out, sir. It remains on the
extreme edge of our sensor perception.


195
0:18:18,199 --> 0:18:21,85
Or it could be taunting us
by cloaking and uncloaking.


196
0:18:21,85 --> 0:18:24,71
Klingon? Romulan?


197
0:18:24,71 --> 0:18:26,768
Either is possible.


198
0:18:26,768 --> 0:18:29,534
Lieutenant Uhura, hail that ship.


199
0:18:29,534 --> 0:18:33,55
Aye, sir.


200
0:18:33,55 --> 0:18:37,51
Federation Starship USS Enterprise
to unidentified vessel.


201
0:18:37,51 --> 0:18:43,369
State your planet of origin
and purpose in this quadrant.


202
0:18:43,369 --> 0:18:45,26
No response, sir.


203
0:18:45,26 --> 0:18:47,57
Open a channel, Lieutenant.


204
0:18:47,57 --> 0:18:49,61
Aye, sir.


205
0:18:49,61 --> 0:18:52,49
Kargh, if that’s you – no more games.


206
0:18:52,49 --> 0:18:56,39
As of right now, my phasers are armed,
and they’re going to stay hot.


207
0:18:56,39 --> 0:18:57,694
Close channel, Lieutenant.


208
0:18:57,694 --> 0:18:59,307
Aye, sir.


209
0:18:59,307 --> 0:19:1,695
Mr. Spock, this ship is on yellow alert.


210
0:19:1,695 --> 0:19:5,7
All ship’s eyes and ears are
to remain on that intruder.


211
0:19:5,7 --> 0:19:7,78
I want to know their every move.


212
0:19:7,78 --> 0:19:9,734
If he’s cloaked, sir....


213
0:19:9,734 --> 0:19:12,704
Then he has to uncloak to 
fire his disrupters.


214
0:19:12,704 --> 0:19:18,4
 Full yellow alert, Mr. Spock, until 
and unless I order a stand-down.


215
0:19:18,4 --> 0:19:23,417
Understood, Captain.


216
0:19:23,417 --> 0:19:27,6
I'm young.


217
0:19:27,6 --> 0:19:31,12
Damn it, I’m young,


218
0:19:31,12 --> 0:19:37,107
and this can’t happen!


219
0:19:37,107 --> 0:19:39,29
Why me?


220
0:19:39,29 --> 0:19:42,48
I didn’t do anything.


221
0:19:42,48 --> 0:19:45,281
I was just there.


222
0:19:45,281 --> 0:19:48,35
Everyone else was cured.


223
0:19:48,35 --> 0:19:54,26
Why am I the only one that wasn’t?


224
0:19:54,26 --> 0:20:0,831
I didn’t do anything.


225
0:20:0,831 --> 0:20:3,824
[Door Buzzer]


226
0:20:3,824 --> 0:20:6,28
Who... who's there?


227
0:20:6,28 --> 0:20:11,18
Lady Rayna. May I come in?


228
0:20:11,18 --> 0:20:22,45
A moment, please.


229
0:20:22,45 --> 0:20:29,9
Come.


230
0:20:29,9 --> 0:20:35,41
Pavel.


231
0:20:35,41 --> 0:20:38,32
I'm so sorry.


232
0:20:38,32 --> 0:20:40,26
Funny,


233
0:20:40,26 --> 0:20:47,26
I didn’t hear an announcement
on the ship’s intercom.


234
0:20:47,26 --> 0:20:48,76
Well, you know how it is.


235
0:20:48,76 --> 0:20:51,503
You tell one person in 
strictest confidence and it's...


236
0:20:51,503 --> 0:20:55,189
all over the ship in an hour.


237
0:20:55,189 --> 0:20:56,82
It’s only a rumor.


238
0:20:56,82 --> 0:20:58,56
Yes but, Pavel, surely...


239
0:20:58,56 --> 0:21:2,27
Dr. McCoy is searching the
medical files right now.


240
0:21:2,27 --> 0:21:4,22
He always has an answer.


241
0:21:4,22 --> 0:21:7,97
Yes, I am sure he will find a cure for you.


242
0:21:7,97 --> 0:21:13,19
Yes.


243
0:21:13,19 --> 0:21:15,703
Get me the Tellerite information.


244
0:21:15,703 --> 0:21:19,48
Their physiology is only
remotely like a human’s.


245
0:21:19,48 --> 0:21:21,433
Get it anyway.


246
0:21:21,433 --> 0:21:34,41
Of course.


247
0:21:34,41 --> 0:21:35,99
So how are we doing?


248
0:21:35,99 --> 0:21:37,41
We're making progress.


249
0:21:37,41 --> 0:21:41,156
Give me another hour, and I’ll have
the second warp engine on line.


250
0:21:41,156 --> 0:21:42,767
Thanks Scotty.


251
0:21:42,767 --> 0:21:46,36
Sir, the unidentified vessel
is moving in our direction.


252
0:21:46,36 --> 0:21:52,29
Bearing 230 mark five.
Picking up speed.


253
0:21:52,29 --> 0:21:54,15
It's gone.


254
0:21:54,15 --> 0:21:57,18
Cloaked.


255
0:21:57,18 --> 0:21:58,66
Trajectory?


256
0:21:58,66 --> 0:22:2,11
Angle on our starboard bow---


257
0:22:2,11 --> 0:22:5,407
Vessel uncloaking. Two hundred thousand
kilometers and closing fast.


258
0:22:5,407 --> 0:22:7,34
It's Klingon.


259
0:22:7,34 --> 0:22:9,178
Disruptor ports are open.


260
0:22:9,178 --> 0:22:10,596
Red Alert. Now.


261
0:22:10,596 --> 0:22:14,87
Red alert. All hands, man your
battle stations -- This is not a drill.


262
0:22:14,87 --> 0:22:19,29
I Repeat, All hands, man your
battle stations -- This is not a drill.


263
0:22:19,29 --> 0:22:20,97
Where are you going?


264
0:22:20,97 --> 0:22:22,4
To my station.


265
0:22:22,4 --> 0:22:24,24
You can't.


266
0:22:24,24 --> 0:22:27,62
I’m the best weapons officer
the Captain has.


267
0:22:27,62 --> 0:22:41,309
Pavel, did he call you?


268
0:22:41,309 --> 0:22:41,997
Deflectors.


269
0:22:41,997 --> 0:22:50,752
Shields up, sir. We have full power on
deflectors and phasers.


270
0:22:50,752 --> 0:22:51,931
Shields haev gone sir.


271
0:22:51,931 --> 0:22:54,453
Scotty, when can I have power to maneuver?


272
0:22:54,453 --> 0:22:57,39
Captain, I can give you phasers and
shields or maneuvering power,


273
0:22:57,39 --> 0:22:58,56
but I canna give you both.


274
0:22:58,56 --> 0:23:4,68
- The best you can, as soon as you can.
- Right, sir. I had better get down there.


275
0:23:4,68 --> 0:23:11,508
Phasers targeted. Ready to fire.


276
0:23:11,508 --> 0:23:15,448
He's coming around, sir.


277
0:23:15,448 --> 0:23:28,95
Fire.


278
0:23:28,95 --> 0:23:34,37
Damage to port sections five and six.
Isolating that section...now.


279
0:23:34,37 --> 0:23:38,673
Helm is sluggish, sir. Power down
thirty percent.... Forty.


280
0:23:38,673 --> 0:23:39,98
Sentell, report.


281
0:23:39,98 --> 0:24:20,758
Diverting power to maneuvering.


282
0:24:20,758 --> 0:24:23,744
Uhura, shut off that noise.
Mr. Spock, monitor the reports


283
0:24:23,744 --> 0:24:25,488
and give me a summary
of the damage.


284
0:24:25,488 --> 0:24:27,438
DeSalle. Do we still have
shields and phasers?


285
0:24:27,438 --> 0:24:32,64
Shields at twenty percent. Phasers are down.
We have full photon torpedo capacity.


286
0:24:32,64 --> 0:24:38,11
- Then let’s give him a jolt.
- Yes, sir.


287
0:24:38,11 --> 0:24:39,99
Damn.


288
0:24:39,99 --> 0:24:41,739
Full spread, sir? If he didn’t deviate
from his original course ---


289
0:24:41,739 --> 0:24:47,411
No, Mr. DeSalle. We might need them later,
and we've got a ship to save. Mr. Spock?


290
0:24:47,411 --> 0:24:49,413
Phaser and shield power is compromised,


291
0:24:49,413 --> 0:24:51,7
but we still have power
to maneuver slowly.


292
0:24:51,7 --> 0:24:55,637
Four quarters decks and one engineering
level are damaged. We have lost crew.


293
0:24:55,637 --> 0:24:57,464
Personnel is checking the roster now.


294
0:24:57,464 --> 0:25:0,122
Sickbay is flooded with injured.


295
0:25:0,122 --> 0:25:2,22
And Mr. Scott?


296
0:25:2,22 --> 0:25:8,726
He begs to inform you he generally only
performs miracles on Tuesdays and Thursdays.


297
0:25:8,726 --> 0:25:11,34
Today is Monday.


298
0:25:11,34 --> 0:25:14,512
Very well. Carry on, then.


299
0:25:14,512 --> 0:25:17,457
[Speaker] Deck 6 forward bulkheads totally blown.


300
0:25:17,457 --> 0:25:21,44
[Speaker] Engineering level 3, extensive
damage to decking and overheads.


301
0:25:21,44 --> 0:25:25,483
[Speaker] Four water recyclers are non-
functional, but they can be rehabbed.


302
0:25:25,483 --> 0:26:6,21
[Speaker: Multiple voice reports at once - unintelligible]


303
0:26:6,21 --> 0:26:8,7
Thank you Miss Okuda.


304
0:26:8,7 --> 0:26:11,157
- Does anyone have any good news?
- There’s a wee tad, sir.


305
0:26:11,157 --> 0:26:15,66
We have all our engines back. On the other hand,
two of our generators were damaged by the


306
0:26:15,66 --> 0:26:17,24
hit on Engineering level 3.


307
0:26:17,24 --> 0:26:20,742
If we go to warp, I don’t have enough
power for the phasers and shields.


308
0:26:20,742 --> 0:26:23,553
If we stay here I can give you those.


309
0:26:23,553 --> 0:26:26,412
So we can run, or we can
stand here and fight.


310
0:26:26,412 --> 0:26:29,773
That’s about it, sir.
We’re working on it.


311
0:26:29,773 --> 0:26:33,945
Lieutenant Uhura, send a subspace Mayday
to all Federation starships in range.


312
0:26:33,945 --> 0:26:37,4
We've been attacked by a Klingon vessel,


313
0:26:37,4 --> 0:26:42,31
without provocation. We're able to move,
but we don’t have adequate defenses.


314
0:26:42,31 --> 0:26:45,136
The Federation ambassadors
on board are at high risk,


315
0:26:45,136 --> 0:26:48,2
and we can't protect them
if we are attacked again.


316
0:26:48,2 --> 0:26:51,796
Captain’s log, supplemental. I have decided
to wait at the site of the attack,


317
0:26:51,796 --> 0:26:55,64
hoping my call for help will bring us
an escort of Federation vessels.


318
0:26:55,64 --> 0:27:0,868
Thus far...no response.


319
0:27:0,868 --> 0:27:3,3
Pavel.


320
0:27:3,3 --> 0:27:8,39
Pavel.


321
0:27:8,39 --> 0:27:11,432
Why you wasting your time sleeping?


322
0:27:11,432 --> 0:27:12,829
What the hell?


323
0:27:12,829 --> 0:27:15,261
What indeed.


324
0:27:15,261 --> 0:27:18,754
I’m still asleep. I have to be.


325
0:27:18,754 --> 0:27:21,18
You’re not.


326
0:27:21,18 --> 0:27:24,32
- You’re not an hallucination.
- Not to you,


327
0:27:24,32 --> 0:27:29,116
but, anyone else looked in here
you would be talking to yourself.


328
0:27:29,116 --> 0:27:31,15
I have to see Dr. McCoy.


329
0:27:31,15 --> 0:27:33,38
He will only tell you what you already know.


330
0:27:33,38 --> 0:27:35,887
What? That I’m losing my mind?


331
0:27:35,887 --> 0:27:39,115
Are you? What do you see
when you look at me?


332
0:27:39,115 --> 0:27:41,75
Myself. The way I should be.


333
0:27:41,75 --> 0:27:47,65
I see the way I will be... Would be.
If I was given the time.


334
0:27:47,65 --> 0:27:53,35
Let me tell you something --
that mirror is not our friend.


335
0:27:53,35 --> 0:27:55,253
We could cover it up.


336
0:27:55,253 --> 0:27:57,264
It wouldn’t change the
truth of the matter.


337
0:27:57,264 --> 0:27:59,45
Are we going to admit what that is?


338
0:27:59,45 --> 0:28:3,1
Yes. I


339
0:28:3,1 --> 0:28:4,84
we --


340
0:28:4,84 --> 0:28:7,603
were young two days ago.


341
0:28:7,603 --> 0:28:9,78
Now look at us.


342
0:28:9,78 --> 0:28:14,45
Grandfather’s hands looked like that.


343
0:28:14,45 --> 0:28:18,49
Do you know what I think?


344
0:28:18,49 --> 0:28:21,13
I'm dying


345
0:28:21,13 --> 0:28:23,35
and you're here.


346
0:28:23,35 --> 0:28:26,23
And this is starting to get


347
0:28:26,23 --> 0:28:31,3
very Russian.


348
0:28:31,3 --> 0:28:35,58
- Any response, Lieutenant?
- No, sir.


349
0:28:35,58 --> 0:28:42,13
- Keep sending the Mayday.
- Aye, sir.


350
0:28:42,13 --> 0:28:45,68
- Do you remember...?
- Everything.


351
0:28:45,68 --> 0:28:50,46
[Both together] Tribbles! (laughing)


352
0:28:50,46 --> 0:28:52,442
Billy Claibourne.


353
0:28:52,442 --> 0:28:54,713
I made a hell of an outlaw.


354
0:28:54,713 --> 0:28:56,807
They killed us then.


355
0:28:56,807 --> 0:29:1,69
It was an illusion. If you
don’t believe, it is not real.


356
0:29:1,69 --> 0:29:4,814
This is real


357
0:29:4,814 --> 0:29:8,17
Yes.


358
0:29:8,17 --> 0:29:12,18
Gamma Trianguli VI.


359
0:29:12,18 --> 0:29:14,85
Yeoman Martha Landon.


360
0:29:14,85 --> 0:29:17,48
She was beautiful.


361
0:29:17,48 --> 0:29:21,52
[Together] We were in love.


362
0:29:21,52 --> 0:29:26,66
A planet where there was no disease
and no one ever grew old.


363
0:29:26,66 --> 0:29:31,15
- The Feeders of Vaal.
- Captive to a machine God.


364
0:29:31,15 --> 0:29:34,21
Would you settle now for such a life?


365
0:29:34,21 --> 0:29:39,134
- I don't know.
- You wouldn’t. I wouldn’t!


366
0:29:39,134 --> 0:29:40,565
Harry Mudd.


367
0:29:40,565 --> 0:29:43,234
And all his beautiful ageless...


368
0:29:43,234 --> 0:29:45,679
- androids!


369
0:29:45,679 --> 0:29:56,953
Captain, I’ve got another blip.
Unidentified vessel closing on us fast.


370
0:29:56,953 --> 0:30:1,544
Uncloaked Klingon vessel.
Not the same one that attacked us.


371
0:30:1,544 --> 0:30:4,731
Message coming in, Captain.
It’s from the Klingon.


372
0:30:4,731 --> 0:30:7,492
On screen.


373
0:30:7,492 --> 0:30:10,637
Greetings, Captain Kirk. We
intercepted your distress call.


374
0:30:10,637 --> 0:30:12,675
Come to gloat?


375
0:30:12,675 --> 0:30:14,433
In fact, we came to help.


376
0:30:14,433 --> 0:30:19,855
Really? Then I’ve a great deal for you on
some waterfront property in Riverside, Iowa.


377
0:30:19,855 --> 0:30:22,293
I do not understand the reference.


378
0:30:22,293 --> 0:30:25,11
Just what do you want, Kargh?


379
0:30:25,11 --> 0:30:28,382
On my honor, Kirk, the ship that
attacked you was not Klingon.


380
0:30:28,382 --> 0:30:32,26
Are you telling that me we didn’t see the
vessel that uncloaked and fired upon us?


381
0:30:32,26 --> 0:30:35,794
I can have the visual record
played back for you. Lt. Uhura---


382
0:30:35,794 --> 0:30:38,27
Have you ever seen a magician’s trick, Kirk?


383
0:30:38,27 --> 0:30:42,31
The success of the trick lies in your
seeing what he wants you to see.


384
0:30:42,31 --> 0:30:44,4
And your point is...?


385
0:30:44,4 --> 0:30:49,747
Kirk, I know where my sister
ships are. On my honor,


386
0:30:49,747 --> 0:30:52,722
the vessel that attacked
you was not Klingon.


387
0:30:52,722 --> 0:30:55,159
Based on past history, I can’t accept that.


388
0:30:55,159 --> 0:31:0,71
Sir. Captain Kargh has twice said, “on his honor”
the attack vessel was not one of theirs.


389
0:31:0,71 --> 0:31:4,905
To Klingons, honor is everything --
more important than their very lives.


390
0:31:4,905 --> 0:31:6,4
He harried the shuttle at Babel.


391
0:31:6,4 --> 0:31:12,214
A different time, a different exercise.
I believe he means exactly as he says.


392
0:31:12,214 --> 0:31:16,8
It was not a Klingon that attacked us.


393
0:31:16,8 --> 0:31:18,93
What are you suggesting, Kargh?


394
0:31:18,93 --> 0:31:20,689
I have a proposition for you.


395
0:31:20,689 --> 0:31:22,5
Then let’s hear it.


396
0:31:22,5 --> 0:31:25,243
I am willing to transport
aboard your ship, Captain.


397
0:31:25,243 --> 0:31:29,321
We should conduct our
business face to face.


398
0:31:29,321 --> 0:31:31,77
All right then, prepare to beam aboard.


399
0:31:31,77 --> 0:31:36,595
I look forward to meeting you.


400
0:31:36,595 --> 0:31:37,688
Lieutenant Uhura,


401
0:31:37,688 --> 0:31:42,15
Have Security escort Mr. Kargh to the
Briefing Room, and ask Mr. Scott to join us.


402
0:31:42,15 --> 0:31:51,402
Spock, your with me.
DeSalle, you have the Conn.


403
0:31:51,402 --> 0:31:57,6
Growing up, this was all that I wanted,
to be an officer on a starship.


404
0:31:57,6 --> 0:31:58,992
But once I did that,


405
0:31:58,992 --> 0:32:3,397
It wasn’t enough, just to have
my commission and this berth.


406
0:32:3,397 --> 0:32:8,23
I had to be the best navigator,
the best weapons officer.


407
0:32:8,23 --> 0:32:13,722
Not just the best on this ship --
the best in the Fleet.


408
0:32:13,722 --> 0:32:17,681
We did devote a lot of time to duty.


409
0:32:17,681 --> 0:32:22,66
That was before. I had years to spend,


410
0:32:22,66 --> 0:32:27,704
and now this thief of time in
my body has taken them.


411
0:32:27,704 --> 0:32:30,55
I’ve lost all the things I could have had.


412
0:32:30,55 --> 0:32:33,45
Opportunity,


413
0:32:33,45 --> 0:32:34,347
love


414
0:32:34,347 --> 0:32:38,77
joy,


415
0:32:38,77 --> 0:32:42,725
Life.


416
0:32:42,725 --> 0:32:47,803
I am 25 years old.


417
0:32:47,803 --> 0:32:51,437
I’m not just going to die,


418
0:32:51,437 --> 0:32:55,648
I didn’t get to live!


419
0:32:55,648 --> 0:32:59,365
We both had the same dreams.


420
0:32:59,365 --> 0:33:3,186
Why are you here?


421
0:33:3,186 --> 0:33:5,784
I suppose I want to know...


422
0:33:5,784 --> 0:33:9,552
if this is  all there is, was it worth it?


423
0:33:9,552 --> 0:33:12,378
That’s one of those questions, isn’t it?


424
0:33:12,378 --> 0:33:16,269
Was I a good person?
Did I make a difference anywhere?


425
0:33:16,269 --> 0:33:19,381
Was I worth the time I spent here?


426
0:33:19,381 --> 0:33:21,155
I’d like to say yes.


427
0:33:21,155 --> 0:33:24,988
So would I. But can I?


428
0:33:24,988 --> 0:33:27,964
- You saved Scott’s life.
- Reflexes.


429
0:33:27,964 --> 0:33:32,792
No, you had a choice. You could have
gotten of the way and saved yourself.


430
0:33:32,792 --> 0:33:35,11
Maybe.


431
0:33:35,11 --> 0:33:37,803
Would you have done anything else?


432
0:33:37,803 --> 0:33:40,948
If I knew the cost?


433
0:33:40,948 --> 0:33:45,457
I honestly don’t know.


434
0:33:45,457 --> 0:33:51,308
And what’s left?
We don’t have much time.


435
0:33:51,308 --> 0:33:53,574
I should be on that bridge.


436
0:33:53,574 --> 0:33:58,452
That Klingon is still out there, and I’m the
best weapons officer the Captain has.


437
0:33:58,452 --> 0:34:1,235
Best in the Fleet.
Why not report in?


438
0:34:1,235 --> 0:34:4,32
I can’t! Dr. McCoy won't clear me for duty.


439
0:34:4,32 --> 0:34:9,764
But he will.


440
0:34:9,764 --> 0:34:12,977
Yes.


441
0:34:12,977 --> 0:34:21,187
He has to...


442
0:34:21,187 --> 0:34:22,492
Welcome aboard.


443
0:34:22,492 --> 0:34:25,137
Odd situation we are in,
isn’t it, Kirk?


444
0:34:25,137 --> 0:34:28,205
If we're going to make the most of this,
we had better get started.


445
0:34:28,205 --> 0:34:38,37
Please.


446
0:34:38,37 --> 0:34:41,372
"Anything can be resolved ---"


447
0:34:41,372 --> 0:34:46,133
"-- after a hot glass of tea."


448
0:34:46,133 --> 0:34:50,797
Grandfather’s motto.


449
0:34:50,797 --> 0:34:53,584
But not this.


450
0:34:53,584 --> 0:34:56,19
No.


451
0:34:56,19 --> 0:35:2,379
"Curative properties. Good for the soul."


452
0:35:2,379 --> 0:35:5,506
Can’t cure this problem.


453
0:35:5,506 --> 0:35:8,208
- Do you remember?
- Everything.


454
0:35:8,208 --> 0:35:10,258
I was thinking of Apollo.


455
0:35:10,258 --> 0:35:13,163
Tried to make us worship him. Obey him.


456
0:35:13,163 --> 0:35:15,912
Overstepped his bounds there,
the arrogant ---


457
0:35:15,912 --> 0:35:17,322
Well, he’d been a god.


458
0:35:17,322 --> 0:35:18,916
Have you noticed that never works?


459
0:35:18,916 --> 0:35:20,361
I did. I wonder why.


460
0:35:20,361 --> 0:35:22,464
Because humans have this
stubborn streak in them.


461
0:35:22,464 --> 0:35:26,882
You try to tame them,
bend them, they rebel.


462
0:35:26,882 --> 0:35:31,27
Why aren’t we rebelling
against this thing?


463
0:35:31,27 --> 0:35:33,475
You go into service,


464
0:35:33,475 --> 0:35:35,693
you know you could die.


465
0:35:35,693 --> 0:35:39,759
You hope you won’t,
but you know you can.


466
0:35:39,759 --> 0:35:43,792
If you’re lucky, you’ll live
past your service years,


467
0:35:43,792 --> 0:35:46,247
take your pension and go live on a


468
0:35:46,247 --> 0:35:49,548
nice blue and white planet
in sunshine and joy.


469
0:35:49,548 --> 0:35:51,318
And?


470
0:35:51,318 --> 0:35:55,281
Not "And." - "Or".


471
0:35:55,281 --> 0:36:2,8
You die young and,
one hopes, heroically.


472
0:36:2,8 --> 0:36:4,508
But this...


473
0:36:4,508 --> 0:36:8,704
No heroics. No glory.
No sunshine and joy.


474
0:36:8,704 --> 0:36:12,179
But we’ve done a thing
or two, haven’t we?


475
0:36:12,179 --> 0:36:17,73
Are you ashamed of our record?
Of how we’ve served?


476
0:36:17,73 --> 0:36:26,43
No. I...


477
0:36:26,43 --> 0:36:29,865
we..., did our best.


478
0:36:29,865 --> 0:36:33,573
Yes.


479
0:36:33,573 --> 0:36:35,603
Damn right.


480
0:36:35,603 --> 0:36:37,986
Should we regret?


481
0:36:37,986 --> 0:36:46,812
Not one thing. Ever.


482
0:36:46,812 --> 0:36:49,891
Can you prove no Klingon was
responsible for this attack?


483
0:36:49,891 --> 0:36:54,15
How? Shall I contact our sister ships
and interrogate the captains?


484
0:36:54,15 --> 0:36:57,5
And if I did, would you believe them?


485
0:36:57,5 --> 0:36:58,737
No!


486
0:36:58,737 --> 0:37:1,4
We have to trust your "honor", Kargh.


487
0:37:1,4 --> 0:37:4,735
Why attack the Enterprise so
deep in Federation space?


488
0:37:4,735 --> 0:37:6,605
Why attack your ship at all?


489
0:37:6,605 --> 0:37:10,988
Because, you’re not above causing
chaos where you can, laddie.


490
0:37:10,988 --> 0:37:14,98
Captain Kirk, you understand
we have “ears” on Babel.


491
0:37:14,98 --> 0:37:18,662
We are well aware the economic
conference was useless.


492
0:37:18,662 --> 0:37:22,757
Threatening the Federation ambassadors
aboard is a waste of effort.


493
0:37:22,757 --> 0:37:26,36
They are only going home to report defeat.


494
0:37:26,36 --> 0:37:28,612
Failing fringe planets will be abandoned


495
0:37:28,612 --> 0:37:34,27
and can be taken over by our
invasion troops, if we want them.


496
0:37:34,27 --> 0:37:38,724
The only reason to attack you, is to
place blame on the Klingon Empire.


497
0:37:38,724 --> 0:37:42,219
And who would want to do that?


498
0:37:42,219 --> 0:37:44,94
The Romulan Star Empire.


499
0:37:44,94 --> 0:37:48,578
Possible, Captain. They are
occasional Klingon allies,


500
0:37:48,578 --> 0:37:50,461
but they do not have the same goals.


501
0:37:50,461 --> 0:37:52,403
You would know, of course.


502
0:37:52,403 --> 0:37:56,71
Projections based on past history and
societal ambitions are quite logical.


503
0:37:56,71 --> 0:37:58,547
Or it could be someone else.


504
0:37:58,547 --> 0:38:1,803
Which is why I am offering our assistance.


505
0:38:1,803 --> 0:38:6,534
Cut him loose, Captain. Why would
this Sassenach want to help us?


506
0:38:6,534 --> 0:38:11,293
Because whoever it is,
is an enemy to us both.


507
0:38:11,293 --> 0:38:13,845
You’re on, Captain.


508
0:38:13,845 --> 0:38:16,804
Let’s do this…


509
0:38:16,804 --> 0:38:25,66
together.


510
0:38:25,66 --> 0:38:27,357
Captains log, supplemental.


511
0:38:27,357 --> 0:38:30,564
The Enterprise faces the
possibility of another attack.


512
0:38:30,564 --> 0:38:34,91
This time, however, we
have an unlikely ally.


513
0:38:34,91 --> 0:38:38,22
On screen, Mr. Spock.


514
0:38:38,22 --> 0:38:40,85
This is the ship that attacked us.


515
0:38:40,85 --> 0:38:43,18
It is a perfect replica.


516
0:38:43,18 --> 0:38:44,958
Replica?


517
0:38:44,958 --> 0:38:48,521
Since it could not have been one
of our ships, it must be a replica.


518
0:38:48,521 --> 0:38:52,46
The name? The symbols on the ship?


519
0:38:52,46 --> 0:38:54,312
"Danger Stalker".


520
0:38:54,312 --> 0:38:58,1
And an identifying vessel number.
Before you ask,


521
0:38:58,1 --> 0:39:0,14
there is no such ship in our fleet.


522
0:39:0,14 --> 0:39:2,58
But if the Klingons can
prove it’s not theirs---


523
0:39:2,58 --> 0:39:5,621
The marauder does not intend for
that to happen, Commander Scott.


524
0:39:5,621 --> 0:39:7,713
They can destroy us and
leave enough evidence


525
0:39:7,713 --> 0:39:9,961
the Klingons perpetrated the attack.


526
0:39:9,961 --> 0:39:12,695
The Federation leaps to the desired conclusion.


527
0:39:12,695 --> 0:39:15,124
And we’re in the middle of a war …


528
0:39:15,124 --> 0:39:18,42
Clever. But we’re not
going to cooperate.


529
0:39:18,42 --> 0:39:20,81
Mr. Scott, repair status?


530
0:39:20,81 --> 0:39:23,779
You’re going to owe the entire
Engineering Department a round, Sir.


531
0:39:23,779 --> 0:39:26,77
Both the phasers and
the shields are back on line.


532
0:39:26,77 --> 0:39:29,678
Two rounds, Mr. Scott –
just as soon as we’re out of this.


533
0:39:29,678 --> 0:39:32,389
Gentlemen, now we recall our Mayday.


534
0:39:32,389 --> 0:39:35,26
We're fully operational,
so we don't need any more help.


535
0:39:35,26 --> 0:39:39,221
We can report that this
alien ship is not Klingon.


536
0:39:39,221 --> 0:39:41,16
Baiting a trap.


537
0:39:41,16 --> 0:39:58,115
With a little help from our friends.
-- let’s move.


538
0:39:58,115 --> 0:39:59,99
[Door buzzer]


539
0:39:59,99 --> 0:40:1,629
[Intercom] Pavel -- it’s Rayna.


540
0:40:1,629 --> 0:40:4,19
Come.


541
0:40:4,19 --> 0:40:9,38
I thought you might need some
company. I know I certainly do.


542
0:40:9,38 --> 0:40:14,315
It has gotten lonely in here,
the last few hours.


543
0:40:14,315 --> 0:40:17,39
Shutting yourself off?


544
0:40:17,39 --> 0:40:19,466
Do you mind if I turn up the lights?


545
0:40:19,466 --> 0:40:27,313
No.


546
0:40:27,313 --> 0:40:30,801
I’m sorry if I embarrassed you.


547
0:40:30,801 --> 0:40:35,91
There is not much left to embarrass.


548
0:40:35,91 --> 0:40:43,248
It’s all right. Leave the lights up.


549
0:40:43,248 --> 0:40:45,856
The Enterprise is fully repaired.


550
0:40:45,856 --> 0:40:50,51
The Captain expects another
attack, but we have an ally.


551
0:40:50,51 --> 0:40:53,573
But no one responded to our Mayday.


552
0:40:53,573 --> 0:40:55,588
Someone did.


553
0:40:55,588 --> 0:40:59,11
Captain Kargh of the Dark Destroyer.


554
0:40:59,11 --> 0:41:2,678
You've got to be joking.


555
0:41:2,678 --> 0:41:3,95
No,


556
0:41:3,95 --> 0:41:7,654
that would be a Russian joke.


557
0:41:7,654 --> 0:41:11,864
Oh, Pavel...if ever you were needed,
it will be in the next hours.


558
0:41:11,864 --> 0:41:21,13
That may be all the time I have left.


559
0:41:21,13 --> 0:41:24,89
U.S.S. Enterprise to all Federation
vessels in the Alpha Quadrant.


560
0:41:24,89 --> 0:41:30,963
We're withdrawing our Mayday. We
have no further need of assistance.


561
0:41:30,963 --> 0:41:34,27
There are few similar diseases,
but they’re genetic and


562
0:41:34,27 --> 0:41:35,855
and not induced in the same way.


563
0:41:35,855 --> 0:41:38,302
But similar.


564
0:41:38,302 --> 0:41:44,568
There are no cures for them, either.


565
0:41:44,568 --> 0:41:47,81
I have to report to the captain.


566
0:41:47,81 --> 0:41:52,977
I understand.


567
0:41:52,977 --> 0:41:55,42
- McCoy to Kirk.
- Kirk here.


568
0:41:55,42 --> 0:41:58,678
Captain, I have completed my
final examination of Mr. Chekov.


569
0:41:58,678 --> 0:42:3,226
As we discussed, the
situation has not changed.


570
0:42:3,226 --> 0:42:5,386
My diagnosis remains the same.


571
0:42:5,386 --> 0:42:6,666
Thank you, Bones.


572
0:42:6,666 --> 0:42:13,303
Mr. Chekov -- We’re going to need you.
Report to the bridge.


573
0:42:13,303 --> 0:42:16,801
Was that the wisest decision, Jim?


574
0:42:16,801 --> 0:42:19,587
Maybe not, Spock.


575
0:42:19,587 --> 0:42:22,99
But it was the best one.


576
0:42:22,99 --> 0:42:34,911
You heard the Captain.


577
0:42:34,911 --> 0:42:38,929
How much time do I have?


578
0:42:38,929 --> 0:42:41,56
Honestly.


579
0:42:41,56 --> 0:42:50,287
Damn it, Pavel, I’m a doctor, not a watchmaker.


580
0:42:50,287 --> 0:42:55,646
Soon.


581
0:42:55,646 --> 0:43:0,131
It's all right.


582
0:43:0,131 --> 0:43:4,385
Damn it, man, you saved Scotty,
but you sacrificed ---


583
0:43:4,385 --> 0:43:7,886
No sacrifices.


584
0:43:7,886 --> 0:43:10,881
It was worth it.


585
0:43:10,881 --> 0:43:13,49
It was all worth it.


586
0:43:13,49 --> 0:43:17,12
You can’t know that.


587
0:43:17,12 --> 0:43:23,88
Oh Yes … I can.


588
0:43:23,88 --> 0:44:14,815
Go on. Captain wants you on the bridge.


589
0:44:14,815 --> 0:44:19,91
Klingon vessel uncloaking on the port
bow, one hundred thousand kilometers.


590
0:44:19,91 --> 0:44:27,95
Relative position, 180 degrees mark three.


591
0:44:27,95 --> 0:44:33,621
I have him. On screen.


592
0:44:33,621 --> 0:44:38,106
Long range full perimeter scan...
No other vessels, sir.


593
0:44:38,106 --> 0:44:48,155
[Kirk] Where's Kargh?
[Sulu] Probably ran.


594
0:44:48,155 --> 0:44:50,999
They are targeting the previously
damaged area, Captain.


595
0:44:50,999 --> 0:44:57,111
Shields?


596
0:44:57,111 --> 0:45:4,62
Holding, Sir.


597
0:45:4,62 --> 0:45:20,68
Mr. Chekov?


598
0:45:20,68 --> 0:45:23,511
Forward shields are gone.
Secondary deflectors holding.


599
0:45:23,511 --> 0:45:25,199
Phasers still charged and ready.


600
0:45:25,199 --> 0:45:26,156
Captain!


601
0:45:26,156 --> 0:45:31,6
The hostile is recharging disrupters.


602
0:45:31,6 --> 0:45:50,767
Now.


603
0:45:50,767 --> 0:46:1,862
The marauder has been damaged.
But not enough. He’s coming about.


604
0:46:1,862 --> 0:46:3,934
The marauder is preparing to fire again.


605
0:46:3,934 --> 0:46:7,33
Secondary shields gone.
We still have phasers.


606
0:46:7,33 --> 0:46:9,84
- Any signal from Kargh?
- Negative, sir.


607
0:46:9,84 --> 0:46:44,662
We cannot withstand another attack, Captain.


608
0:46:44,662 --> 0:46:46,778
The hostile has charged torpedo racks.


609
0:46:46,778 --> 0:46:49,799
A strategic hit will stop Mr. Chekov’s aerobatics.


610
0:46:49,799 --> 0:47:18,774
Not likely.


611
0:47:18,774 --> 0:47:40,876
Got you.


612
0:47:40,876 --> 0:47:44,17
Mr. Chekov,


613
0:47:44,17 --> 0:47:50,27
that was the most elegant weapons 
demonstration I have ever seen.


614
0:47:50,27 --> 0:47:53,134
Captain, incoming message
from the Dark Destroyer.


615
0:47:53,134 --> 0:47:55,743
On screen.


616
0:47:55,743 --> 0:47:58,27
That worked out well.


617
0:47:58,27 --> 0:47:59,74
You're late.


618
0:47:59,74 --> 0:48:1,499
But in time for the kill.


619
0:48:1,499 --> 0:48:4,112
Kargh, we need to know who they are.


620
0:48:4,112 --> 0:48:7,68
Which is why I offer to board the hostile.


621
0:48:7,68 --> 0:48:10,2
They have dishonored the Klingon Empire.


622
0:48:10,2 --> 0:48:13,9
I want to know who these people are
even more than you do, Kirk.


623
0:48:13,9 --> 0:48:31,433
Very well, Captain. But I expect a
report as soon as you find anything.


624
0:48:31,433 --> 0:49:7,366
Permission to return to my quarters, Captain?


625
0:49:7,366 --> 0:49:57,26
Lieutenant Uhura, have Ambassador
Morgan come up to the bridge.


626
0:49:57,26 --> 0:50:0,665
Sir, report coming in from
Captain Kargh on the hostile.


627
0:50:0,665 --> 0:50:4,656
On screen, Lieutenant.


628
0:50:4,656 --> 0:50:5,961
What is it, Kargh?


629
0:50:5,961 --> 0:50:9,652
As I assured you, Kirk,
this is not a Klingon vessel.


630
0:50:9,652 --> 0:50:12,938
It is a Federation ship modified
to look like one of ours.


631
0:50:12,938 --> 0:50:15,733
but only on the exterior
and in its weaponry.


632
0:50:15,733 --> 0:50:18,665
What’s its origin?


633
0:50:18,665 --> 0:50:23,89
[Kargh and Rayna] Esterion system.


634
0:50:23,89 --> 0:50:24,195
How can you tell?


635
0:50:24,195 --> 0:50:28,944
Well look at him. He hasn’t
even covered his interface.


636
0:50:28,944 --> 0:50:33,251
This whole ship reflects their building
style. Federation, yes --


637
0:50:33,251 --> 0:50:35,303
but with Esterion’s particular touches.


638
0:50:35,303 --> 0:50:36,445
And how would you know?


639
0:50:36,445 --> 0:50:38,355
Captain, I believe I know
what's happened.


640
0:50:38,355 --> 0:50:44,52
Esterion is one of the systems with a shaky
economy, hovering on the edge of collapse.


641
0:50:44,52 --> 0:50:45,493
I don’t understand.


642
0:50:45,493 --> 0:50:48,99
Esterion is known for their engineering
and technological advancements.


643
0:50:48,99 --> 0:50:51,105
They are extremely valuable 
for the entire Federation.


644
0:50:51,105 --> 0:50:56,439
Absolutely, but they’ve placed primary emphasis
on combat devices and inventions.


645
0:50:56,439 --> 0:50:59,845
In a Federation of peace, they
face failure on a planet-wide level


646
0:50:59,845 --> 0:51:2,274
because there is no use for their technology.


647
0:51:2,274 --> 0:51:5,504
And they've consistently refused
to change directions or goals,


648
0:51:5,504 --> 0:51:8,643
even though it means 
their own economic death.


649
0:51:8,643 --> 0:51:14,141
Their philosophy is that there will always be a
war. All they have to do is simply wait for one.


650
0:51:14,141 --> 0:51:15,983
But how did they get a cloaking device?


651
0:51:15,983 --> 0:51:20,187
Captain, my inquiries into classified records
indicates that Starfleet gave it to them


652
0:51:20,187 --> 0:51:26,39
for reverse engineering after we... ”removed it”
from the Romulan vessel eighteen months ago.


653
0:51:26,39 --> 0:51:30,959
And if they could provoke a war between
the Federation and the Klingons---


654
0:51:30,959 --> 0:51:35,743
A war would fuel their entire economy -- make
them more necessary to the Federation.


655
0:51:35,743 --> 0:51:38,6
But to not them alone.


656
0:51:38,6 --> 0:51:39,436
Who's in on this with you?


657
0:51:39,436 --> 0:51:45,296
We’ve already asked that question.
This one has chosen not to answer it.


658
0:51:45,296 --> 0:51:47,147
What about the others on board?


659
0:51:47,147 --> 0:51:49,281
All dead.


660
0:51:49,281 --> 0:51:51,555
By their own hand, I can assure you.


661
0:51:51,555 --> 0:51:53,442
I can continue questioning---


662
0:51:53,442 --> 0:51:56,669
No. Prepare them to beam
aboard the Enterprise.


663
0:51:56,669 --> 0:51:58,755
They’ll face trial for
their crimes.


664
0:51:58,755 --> 0:52:1,429
And their planetary leaders will join them.


665
0:52:1,429 --> 0:52:6,886
I owe you that courtesy, Kirk --
but only because we stood together this time.


666
0:52:6,886 --> 0:52:9,135
The next time....


667
0:52:9,135 --> 0:52:11,81
Until then, Kargh.


668
0:52:11,81 --> 0:52:12,789
Channel close, Miss Uhura.


669
0:52:12,789 --> 0:52:14,566
Sir.


670
0:52:14,566 --> 0:52:18,51
Mr. Spock we’ll detain the Esterion and
tow his vessel to the nearest Starbase.


671
0:52:18,51 --> 0:52:23,644
Ambassador, I’d like your written opinion on this
situation to go along with my official report.


672
0:52:23,644 --> 0:52:27,731
Of course.


673
0:52:27,731 --> 0:52:31,702
You realize, we may never
discover who else was involved.


674
0:52:31,702 --> 0:52:36,699
You mean, we may never know who all of 
our enemies are -- inside the Federation.


675
0:52:36,699 --> 0:52:39,41
Keep it in mind, Captain Kirk.


676
0:52:39,41 --> 0:53:16,983
And look to your back.


677
0:53:16,983 --> 0:53:21,11
Pavel …


678
0:53:21,11 --> 0:53:24,2
We’re almost at Starbase 16.


679
0:53:24,2 --> 0:53:30,588
From there, the ambassadors will be 
given transit to their home planets.


680
0:53:30,588 --> 0:53:34,134
Leaving?


681
0:53:34,134 --> 0:53:36,711
In a few moments.


682
0:53:36,711 --> 0:53:42,45
You need a pilot.


683
0:53:42,45 --> 0:53:47,139
- A shuttle.
- Mr. Scott has volunteered.


684
0:53:47,139 --> 0:53:49,53
Good man.


685
0:53:49,53 --> 0:53:54,978
Thanks to you he’s alive to do it . . .


686
0:53:54,978 --> 0:53:56,874
Pavel,


687
0:53:56,874 --> 0:54:3,27
it has been my great honor...
and joy...to know you.


688
0:54:3,27 --> 0:54:9,84
Thank you . . . for bringing me home.


689
0:54:9,84 --> 0:54:12,849
The pleasure


690
0:54:12,849 --> 0:54:16,86
has been mine,


691
0:54:16,86 --> 0:54:29,28
my lady.


692
0:54:29,28 --> 0:54:34,1
Do Svidania …
(Farewell)


693
0:54:34,1 --> 0:54:47,449
Thank you, Ambassador.


694
0:54:47,449 --> 0:54:49,919
There's...


695
0:54:49,919 --> 0:54:56,29
been a steady stream of visitors


696
0:54:56,29 --> 0:54:59,889
through here today.


697
0:54:59,889 --> 0:55:1,716
Sulu...


698
0:55:1,716 --> 0:55:4,444
Uhura...


699
0:55:4,444 --> 0:55:8,677
... Doctor McCoy.


700
0:55:8,677 --> 0:55:14,65
Mr. Scott, he brought me a bottle of vodka...


701
0:55:14,65 --> 0:55:17,271
for...


702
0:55:17,271 --> 0:55:22,81
when I’m on my feet again.


703
0:55:22,81 --> 0:55:25,8
And...


704
0:55:25,8 --> 0:55:30,747
S... Spock.


705
0:55:30,747 --> 0:55:33,595
For


706
0:55:33,595 --> 0:55:39,101
my journey.


707
0:55:39,101 --> 0:55:41,98
I thought I’d take my turn.


708
0:55:41,98 --> 0:55:44,13
Captain and all.


709
0:55:44,13 --> 0:55:48,5
Who’d have thought, I’d live so long,


710
0:55:48,5 --> 0:55:51,28
in such a short time.


711
0:55:51,28 --> 0:55:54,47
I didn’t …


712
0:55:54,47 --> 0:55:57,51
do too badly, did I?


713
0:55:57,51 --> 0:55:59,41
Never.


714
0:55:59,41 --> 0:56:3,22
You had top marks from the beginning.


715
0:56:3,22 --> 0:56:6,69
The bridge will never be the same without you.


716
0:56:6,69 --> 0:56:10,33
You’re the best Weapons Officer,


717
0:56:10,33 --> 0:56:18,382
the best navigator.


718
0:56:18,382 --> 0:56:23,0
... in the fleet.


719
0:56:23,0 --> 0:56:44,592
In the fleet.


720
0:56:44,592 --> 0:57:25,467

Captain's log, stardate 2683.4


723
0:57:45,433 --> 0:57:47,589
An attempt to rescue the Enterprise
from a Romulan threat,


724
0:57:47,589 --> 0:57:50,4
has propelled Sulu forward, 
thirty years in time.


725
0:57:50,4 --> 0:57:53,601
There's a signal. Looks to be Sulu,


726
0:57:53,601 --> 0:57:59,926
but something's nee right.


727
0:57:59,926 --> 0:58:4,56
Mr. Sulu, what was 30 years to you,
was 30 seconds to us.


728
0:58:4,56 --> 0:58:6,24
Something else.


729
0:58:6,24 --> 0:58:8,978
- Alana.
- Who is she?


730
0:58:8,978 --> 0:58:10,737
She's my daughter.


731
0:58:10,737 --> 0:58:12,487
You're Captain Kirk, aren't you?


732
0:58:12,487 --> 0:58:13,741
How did you know?


733
0:58:13,741 --> 0:58:15,842
My father told me
you were impressive...


734
0:58:15,842 --> 0:58:20,9
...and knew it.


735
0:58:20,9 --> 0:58:23,68
You command miracles
and you don't even know it.


736
0:58:23,68 --> 0:58:27,96
I'm starting to.


737
0:58:27,96 --> 0:58:40,4
We now have only 32 minutes,
before our shields collapse.


738
0:58:40,4 --> 0:58:44,834
I don't care who dies--
she lives!
