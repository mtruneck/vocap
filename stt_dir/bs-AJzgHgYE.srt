 episode of Wicked Tuna.</i>


2
0:0:12,645 --> 0:0:13,679
Dave: And he's
gonna (bleep) us.


3
0:0:13,679 --> 0:0:16,315
Paul: He's used to being
the number one boat.


4
0:0:16,315 --> 0:0:18,5
Kevin: There's only room
for one Number One in this


5
0:0:18,5 --> 0:0:18,751
group.


6
0:0:18,751 --> 0:0:20,152
Dave: I want to be on top.


7
0:0:20,152 --> 0:0:23,289
Paul: It was like someone
(bleep) flicked a switch.


8
0:0:23,289 --> 0:0:25,357
Dave: (Bleep) them,
(bleep) them all.


9
0:0:25,357 --> 0:0:27,526
Kevin: I know he's a
little jealous right now.


10
0:0:27,526 --> 0:0:29,161
Dave's been humbled.


11
0:0:29,161 --> 0:0:30,529
Humbled and hobbled.


12
0:0:30,529 --> 0:0:31,831
Dave: I want the (bleep)
biggest one in the fleet


13
0:0:31,831 --> 0:0:32,765
this year.


14
0:0:32,765 --> 0:0:34,633
Marciano: Holy (bleep).


15
0:0:34,633 --> 0:0:35,334
Bill: Oh, my God.


16
0:0:35,334 --> 0:0:36,268
He's right under the boat.


17
0:0:36,268 --> 0:0:38,737
Marciano: Any rod
can go any minute.


18
0:0:38,737 --> 0:0:40,573
Scott: It's all right, I'll
play this game all night.


19
0:0:40,573 --> 0:0:41,574
That's huge.


20
0:0:41,574 --> 0:0:42,908
This is a monster.


21
0:0:42,908 --> 0:0:45,77
Paul: The biggest one, ever.


22
0:0:45,77 --> 0:0:46,946
Kevin: Oh, my god.


23
0:0:46,946 --> 0:0:48,614
<i> Narrator: Fishing
 is a hard life.</i>


24
0:0:48,614 --> 0:0:50,82
Ralph: There's gonna
be confrontation.


25
0:0:50,82 --> 0:0:52,351
<i> Narrator: And harder with
 bluefin stocks depleted.</i>


26
0:0:52,351 --> 0:0:53,853
<i> In Gloucester,
 Massachusetts,</i>


27
0:0:53,853 --> 0:0:55,988
<i> there's a special
 breed of fisherman.</i>


28
0:0:55,988 --> 0:0:58,457
<i> For generations, they've
 used rod and reel to catch</i>


29
0:0:58,457 --> 0:1:0,192
<i> the elusive bluefin tuna.</i>


30
0:1:0,192 --> 0:1:1,393
Jay: Yeah, baby!


31
0:1:1,393 --> 0:1:2,895

 on these fish for their</i>

33
0:1:3,796 --> 0:1:5,331
<i> The competition is brutal.</i>


34
0:1:5,331 --> 0:1:6,599
Scott: You miserable prick.


35
0:1:6,599 --> 0:1:16,242
<i> Narrator: This
 is Wicked Tuna.</i>


36
0:1:16,242 --> 0:1:17,476
Dave: It's great
to be on top.


37
0:1:17,476 --> 0:1:18,544
It's great to make
all the money.


38
0:1:18,544 --> 0:1:20,98
But with that, nobody
likes a winner.


39
0:1:20,98 --> 0:1:23,282
Marciano: For me the money
doesn't fall out of the sky,


40
0:1:23,282 --> 0:1:25,151
it comes out of the sea.


41
0:1:25,151 --> 0:1:26,619
Bill: This gets harder
as you get older.


42
0:1:26,619 --> 0:1:28,154
But I'm keeping up
with the young guns.


43
0:1:28,154 --> 0:1:29,355
Get out of the way!


44
0:1:29,355 --> 0:1:30,99
Ralph: If it's on my mind
you're gonna hear about it.


45
0:1:30,99 --> 0:1:32,24
And if you did
something to me,


46
0:1:32,24 --> 0:1:45,571
I'm gonna do
something back to you.


47
0:1:45,571 --> 0:1:46,906
Dave: Sandro,
keep throwing 'em.


48
0:1:46,906 --> 0:1:48,774
You keep doing
your job, buddy.


49
0:1:48,774 --> 0:1:49,875
Come on, we got
the fish here.


50
0:1:49,875 --> 0:1:50,609
Paul: Still there.


51
0:1:50,609 --> 0:1:51,71
Two of 'em right now.


52
0:1:51,71 --> 0:1:52,745
Dave: Keep it on.


53
0:1:52,745 --> 0:1:53,979
Keep it, I like it,
gets them frenzied up.


54
0:1:53,979 --> 0:1:55,581
You know what you're seeing
right now on the Tuna.com?


55
0:1:55,581 --> 0:1:57,216
Three good fishermen at
the top of their game,


56
0:1:57,216 --> 0:1:58,918
catching fish
and kicking ass.


57
0:1:58,918 --> 0:2:0,92
Two of 'em right
now under the boat.


58
0:2:0,92 --> 0:2:4,29
All big (bleep)
chum feeding fish.


59
0:2:4,29 --> 0:2:6,759
One of us, sometimes two of
us, sometimes three of us,


60
0:2:6,759 --> 0:2:9,962
are always in the back of
that boat working non-stop.


61
0:2:9,962 --> 0:2:12,798
And that's what we do,
work hard and catch fish.


62
0:2:12,798 --> 0:2:16,1
So we got a bite the
other day, right there.


63
0:2:16,1 --> 0:2:17,303
Paul: They're coming
in hot right now.


64
0:2:17,303 --> 0:2:17,937
They're hot.


65
0:2:17,937 --> 0:2:20,339
Dave: They're hot.


66
0:2:20,339 --> 0:2:22,908
I'm gonna get him in.


67
0:2:22,908 --> 0:2:30,683
Here we go.


68
0:2:30,683 --> 0:2:32,585
Bill: Alright, Charlie.


69
0:2:32,585 --> 0:2:34,587
You have avoided
me long enough.


70
0:2:34,587 --> 0:2:37,556
It's time to jump on
and go for a ride.


71
0:2:37,556 --> 0:2:40,492
This year, we are pretty
much in the hole.


72
0:2:40,492 --> 0:2:42,628
You know it's getting
late in the season now.


73
0:2:42,628 --> 0:2:47,66
You still have
to catch them.


74
0:2:47,66 --> 0:2:47,9
Come on.


75
0:2:47,9 --> 0:2:49,702
Say some prayers,
do something.


76
0:2:49,702 --> 0:2:52,4
Do a voodoo or do
something good.


77
0:2:52,4 --> 0:2:53,772
There you go.


78
0:2:53,772 --> 0:2:55,507
Now you're talking.


79
0:2:55,507 --> 0:2:57,61
I'm telling you,
they're coming.


80
0:2:57,61 --> 0:3:9,288
You watch.


81
0:3:9,288 --> 0:3:11,423
Kevin: We're gonna go
kill one here shortly.


82
0:3:11,423 --> 0:3:12,491
I grew up fishing.


83
0:3:12,491 --> 0:3:14,493
I was one of those kids
that, uh, you know,


84
0:3:14,493 --> 0:3:17,162
I'd skip school and grab a,
a trout rod and sneak down


85
0:3:17,162 --> 0:3:18,97
to the lake.


86
0:3:18,97 --> 0:3:19,999
I caught my first
giant when I was 18.


87
0:3:19,999 --> 0:3:23,35
Once I caught that first
big fish, I, I was hooked.


88
0:3:23,35 --> 0:3:24,203
It, obviously, it's fun.


89
0:3:24,203 --> 0:3:25,471
It's a challenge.


90
0:3:25,471 --> 0:3:29,308
But it's all
about the money.


91
0:3:29,308 --> 0:3:30,376
Sandro: What's he doing?


92
0:3:30,376 --> 0:3:31,277
What the hell, what's
he doing right there?


93
0:3:31,277 --> 0:3:31,877
Dave: Anchored.


94
0:3:31,877 --> 0:3:32,411
Sandro: Right there?


95
0:3:32,411 --> 0:3:33,479
Dave: He's, yeah.


96
0:3:33,479 --> 0:3:34,647
I don't know why he's
not in his other spot.


97
0:3:34,647 --> 0:3:36,582
Kevin anchored way
too (bleep) close.


98
0:3:36,582 --> 0:3:38,851
We steam out of
Gloucester Harbor.


99
0:3:38,851 --> 0:3:39,785
We're fishing.


100
0:3:39,785 --> 0:3:41,2
An hour goes by.


101
0:3:41,2 --> 0:3:43,422
And we look out the window,
and see this boat steaming


102
0:3:43,422 --> 0:3:46,58
right at us and, uh, I
realize its Kevin on the


103
0:3:46,58 --> 0:3:46,825
Christina.


104
0:3:46,825 --> 0:3:47,793
He's been around
a long time.


105
0:3:47,793 --> 0:3:49,161
He's a very
experienced fisherman.


106
0:3:49,161 --> 0:3:50,863
He knows better than
to anchor that close.


107
0:3:50,863 --> 0:3:52,64
And he's gonna (bleep) us.


108
0:3:52,64 --> 0:3:53,265
He's gonna saw us right off
and our day is gonna be


109
0:3:53,265 --> 0:3:54,433
over.


110
0:3:54,433 --> 0:3:55,1
And there's no reason for
him to be sitting right on


111
0:3:55,1 --> 0:3:56,702
top of our anchor.


112
0:3:56,702 --> 0:3:58,837
He knows I've been catching
fish there every day.


113
0:3:58,837 --> 0:4:0,673
So he wanted to be close
to us because we were


114
0:4:0,673 --> 0:4:3,676
definitely pulling up quite
a few fish out of there.


115
0:4:3,676 --> 0:4:5,344
Now he's gonna hook up and
he's gonna (bleep) go right


116
0:4:5,344 --> 0:4:6,845
through our anchor.


117
0:4:6,845 --> 0:4:8,47
Paul: Of course.


118
0:4:8,47 --> 0:4:9,515
Sandro: I can't believe he's
setting up right there.


119
0:4:9,515 --> 0:4:12,184
Dave: I don't
understand that.


120
0:4:12,184 --> 0:4:13,519
And if he hooks up
he's gonna say, "Dave,


121
0:4:13,519 --> 0:4:14,853
you gotta get
off your anchor."


122
0:4:14,853 --> 0:4:15,888
And we're gonna
miss the bite.


123
0:4:15,888 --> 0:4:16,955
Paul: Uh-huh.


124
0:4:16,955 --> 0:4:18,39
Kevin: Dave's
got this thing.


125
0:4:18,39 --> 0:4:21,627
If anybody anchors within
a mile of the Dot Com,


126
0:4:21,627 --> 0:4:23,529
he goes, he comes unglued.


127
0:4:23,529 --> 0:4:24,997
Unglued.


128
0:4:24,997 --> 0:4:26,98
So I said, "You know what?


129
0:4:26,98 --> 0:4:28,3
I'm gonna torture him
a little bit today."


130
0:4:28,3 --> 0:4:29,868
Shut my radio off.


131
0:4:29,868 --> 0:4:32,4
And I anchored
right on top of him.


132
0:4:32,4 --> 0:4:35,107
His theory is, everybody
knows Dave's catching fish,


133
0:4:35,107 --> 0:4:37,776
so they all want to
anchor on top of him.


134
0:4:37,776 --> 0:4:44,283
For me, I just anchored on
top of him to torture him.


135
0:4:44,283 --> 0:4:45,784
Dave: Kevin, keep in mind,
you're pretty close to my


136
0:4:45,784 --> 0:4:49,722
anchor right off the port.


137
0:4:49,722 --> 0:4:53,592
You copy?


138
0:4:53,592 --> 0:4:55,427
Because he anchored
up so close to us,


139
0:4:55,427 --> 0:4:57,863
if he hooks up and makes
us get off the anchor,


140
0:4:57,863 --> 0:5:3,669
I'm gonna be
(bleep) furious.


141
0:5:3,669 --> 0:5:4,87
Kevin: He'll be beatin'
himself against the side of


142
0:5:4,87 --> 0:5:6,138
the boat.


143
0:5:6,138 --> 0:5:7,873
Sammy: That is a
weird looking boat.


144
0:5:7,873 --> 0:5:10,776
Kevin: It is a
weird looking boat.


145
0:5:10,776 --> 0:5:13,545
He was pointing at
us a minute ago.


146
0:5:13,545 --> 0:5:18,83
Dot Com coming unglued.


147
0:5:18,83 --> 0:5:19,618
Dave's been on
top for a while.


148
0:5:19,618 --> 0:5:21,72
But it's definitely
all gonna change.


149
0:5:21,72 --> 0:5:32,164
Somebody's gonna catch
one bigger than his.


150
0:5:32,164 --> 0:5:33,298
Marciano: On the
starboard side,


151
0:5:33,298 --> 0:5:35,601
we got Dave in the Tuna.com.


152
0:5:35,601 --> 0:5:38,804
On the port side, we got
Kevin on the Christina.


153
0:5:38,804 --> 0:5:41,106
And then on the
port side of Kevin,


154
0:5:41,106 --> 0:5:42,508
we have Bounty Hunter.


155
0:5:42,508 --> 0:5:44,71
We're all right
in a row here.


156
0:5:44,71 --> 0:5:47,679
These guys have
been seeing fish.


157
0:5:47,679 --> 0:5:49,782
We're gonna see if we can
snag one right out from in


158
0:5:49,782 --> 0:5:57,756
between them all.


159
0:5:57,756 --> 0:5:59,858
Paul: We got one in the
chum at 35 feet, Dave.


160
0:5:59,858 --> 0:6:0,826
Dave: All right.


161
0:6:0,826 --> 0:6:3,262
Paul: Dude, look
how long he is.


162
0:6:3,262 --> 0:6:4,73
Sandro: He is
(bleep) long, dude.


163
0:6:4,73 --> 0:6:6,565
Holy (bleep).


164
0:6:6,565 --> 0:6:8,167
Paul: Look at how
big he is, Dave!


165
0:6:8,167 --> 0:6:9,34
Dave: Is it really?


166
0:6:9,34 --> 0:6:11,236
Holy (bleep).


167
0:6:11,236 --> 0:6:12,271
Paul: Oh, Dave, right here.


168
0:6:12,271 --> 0:6:14,84
These fish are eating chum.


169
0:6:14,84 --> 0:6:21,814
Dave: I'm gonna get him in.


170
0:6:21,814 --> 0:6:23,449
Bill: Oh, my God, he's
right under the boat, yeah,


171
0:6:23,449 --> 0:6:24,616
a big fish, though.


172
0:6:24,616 --> 0:6:25,984
Real big.


173
0:6:25,984 --> 0:6:26,785
Donna: Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on,


174
0:6:26,785 --> 0:6:27,319
come on.


175
0:6:27,319 --> 0:6:28,22
Bill: How far up?


176
0:6:28,22 --> 0:6:30,155
Scott: He came up
to a hundred feet.


177
0:6:30,155 --> 0:6:31,356
Bill: Here he comes.


178
0:6:31,356 --> 0:6:32,424
Come on baby, come on.


179
0:6:32,424 --> 0:6:36,762
Come on.


180
0:6:36,762 --> 0:6:38,964
Donna: Come on.


181
0:6:38,964 --> 0:6:40,999
Bill: 50 feet.


182
0:6:40,999 --> 0:6:46,371
Here he comes.


183
0:6:46,371 --> 0:6:48,6
Marciano: There we go.


184
0:6:48,6 --> 0:6:49,107
He's coming to life now.


185
0:6:49,107 --> 0:6:55,814
Let's see holy (bleep),
that's a big one, Jay.


186
0:6:55,814 --> 0:6:58,383
Jay: Get your rig on,
I'll put this guy down.


187
0:6:58,383 --> 0:6:59,985
Marciano: I'll be damned if
I'm gonna let somebody else


188
0:6:59,985 --> 0:7:2,387
land this fish.


189
0:7:2,387 --> 0:7:4,223
Jay: 10!


190
0:7:4,223 --> 0:7:8,126
That's a big one.


191
0:7:8,126 --> 0:7:12,798
Marciano: Come on,
baby, you're all mine.


192
0:7:12,798 --> 0:7:14,967
Blair: Ah, that's a big one.


193
0:7:14,967 --> 0:7:15,601
There he is.


194
0:7:15,601 --> 0:7:16,668
He's turning.


195
0:7:16,668 --> 0:7:17,402
Kevin: There he is.


196
0:7:17,402 --> 0:7:18,37
Oh.


197
0:7:18,37 --> 0:7:19,938
I'm looking at the
fish finder, Sammy.


198
0:7:19,938 --> 0:7:21,173
He's right up in the chum.


199
0:7:21,173 --> 0:7:51,169
He's, I know he's big.


200
0:7:51,169 --> 0:7:52,17
We're on, we're on.


201
0:7:52,17 --> 0:7:53,71
Scott, you take the rod.


202
0:7:53,71 --> 0:7:54,473
I'm on the wheel.


203
0:7:54,473 --> 0:7:58,277
Get out of my way.


204
0:7:58,277 --> 0:8:0,445
Blair: Real
tight, real tight.


205
0:8:0,445 --> 0:8:1,346
Scott: Easy.


206
0:8:1,346 --> 0:8:2,581
Kevin: Come on,
stay with him.


207
0:8:2,581 --> 0:8:3,181
Stay with him.


208
0:8:3,181 --> 0:8:4,116
Come on.


209
0:8:4,116 --> 0:8:5,617
Blair: He's coming.


210
0:8:5,617 --> 0:8:6,118
All right, take it easy.


211
0:8:6,118 --> 0:8:7,319
Take it easy.


212
0:8:7,319 --> 0:8:9,388
Kevin: That fish took the
line right out of Scott's


213
0:8:9,388 --> 0:8:12,19
hands, and we hooked up.


214
0:8:12,19 --> 0:8:13,859
Come on, come
on, stay on him.


215
0:8:13,859 --> 0:8:15,6
He's taking line, guys.


216
0:8:15,6 --> 0:8:16,662
Scott: Jesus, Kevin,
he's pulling hard.


217
0:8:16,662 --> 0:8:17,229
Kevin: Make it crank.


218
0:8:17,229 --> 0:8:22,768
There you go.


219
0:8:22,768 --> 0:8:25,37
He's pulling away from us.


220
0:8:25,37 --> 0:8:29,274
Scott: Easy, easy.


221
0:8:29,274 --> 0:8:31,71
Kevin: He took off,
and he kept going.


222
0:8:31,71 --> 0:8:32,77
Scott: Forward!


223
0:8:32,77 --> 0:8:32,945
Forward!


224
0:8:32,945 --> 0:8:34,112
Kevin: And he burned rubber.


225
0:8:34,112 --> 0:8:42,487
Scott: Okay, back
up, back up, back up.


226
0:8:42,487 --> 0:8:46,358
Kevin: Just put some
good pressure on him.


227
0:8:46,358 --> 0:8:47,426
Take him now.


228
0:8:47,426 --> 0:8:50,462
Scott: Hold on, I can't
see him well enough.


229
0:8:50,462 --> 0:8:55,801
Yeah, he's coming around,
he's on his side.


230
0:8:55,801 --> 0:8:57,169
Kevin: I can see him
on the fish finder.


231
0:8:57,169 --> 0:9:1,54
So we're slowly
gaining on him.


232
0:9:1,54 --> 0:9:4,242
If we get him up to 50 feet
or so, he'd see the boat,


233
0:9:4,242 --> 0:9:8,48
he'd go right back
to the bottom.


234
0:9:8,48 --> 0:9:9,481
Blair: Oh, no.


235
0:9:9,481 --> 0:9:10,349
Kevin: He still there?


236
0:9:10,349 --> 0:9:15,454
Scott: I don't
think so, hold on.


237
0:9:15,454 --> 0:9:16,54
Yeah, he's there.


238
0:9:16,54 --> 0:9:17,255
He's there.


239
0:9:17,255 --> 0:9:18,79
Blair: Yep, he's circling.


240
0:9:18,79 --> 0:9:20,25
Scott: Move forward
just a little bit.


241
0:9:20,25 --> 0:9:22,794
Kevin: So we're slowly
gaining on him.


242
0:9:22,794 --> 0:9:24,763
And you're looking down on
the water, I'm like, "Jeez,


243
0:9:24,763 --> 0:9:26,365
this is a big fish."


244
0:9:26,365 --> 0:9:27,432
Blair: He's coming around.


245
0:9:27,432 --> 0:9:28,867
Stop.


246
0:9:28,867 --> 0:9:30,68
Under the boat.


247
0:9:30,68 --> 0:9:31,603
Don't, leave it in neutral.


248
0:9:31,603 --> 0:9:32,838
Swivel's coming.


249
0:9:32,838 --> 0:9:35,34
Under the boat.


250
0:9:35,34 --> 0:9:37,209
Get ready for
the reverse, Kev.


251
0:9:37,209 --> 0:9:37,943
Kevin: I don't like that.


252
0:9:37,943 --> 0:9:38,81
Scott: I don't either.


253
0:9:38,81 --> 0:9:39,745
Blair: Forward,
forward, forward.


254
0:9:39,745 --> 0:9:41,246
Scott: Hold on.


255
0:9:41,246 --> 0:9:43,48
Man: He's on this side.


256
0:9:43,48 --> 0:9:45,283
There he is, he's up on
top, he's coming down.


257
0:9:45,283 --> 0:9:46,685
He's coming right at us.


258
0:9:46,685 --> 0:9:48,22
Yep, he's still there.


259
0:9:48,22 --> 0:9:49,521
He's coming up,
he's coming up,


260
0:9:49,521 --> 0:9:51,356
just come back a little bit.


261
0:9:51,356 --> 0:9:53,525
He's coming up.


262
0:9:53,525 --> 0:9:54,593
You gotta blast him.


263
0:9:54,593 --> 0:9:55,927
Blair: Alright, alright,
alright, bring him up.


264
0:9:55,927 --> 0:9:57,596
Scott: He's coming
up, he's coming up.


265
0:9:57,596 --> 0:10:0,32
Coming up, coming,
coming, coming.


266
0:10:0,32 --> 0:10:0,932
Kevin: Ready to let go?


267
0:10:0,932 --> 0:10:2,501
Scott: No Kevin, no?


268
0:10:2,501 --> 0:10:3,168
Scott: There he is.


269
0:10:3,168 --> 0:10:4,69
Kevin: This is a monster.


270
0:10:4,69 --> 0:10:14,88
Oh my God.


271
0:10:14,88 --> 0:10:15,614
Kevin: Still going?


272
0:10:15,614 --> 0:10:16,682
Scott: Yep.


273
0:10:16,682 --> 0:10:18,55
It's all right, I'll play
this game all night.


274
0:10:18,55 --> 0:10:20,352
Kevin: He started
circling, under the boat,


275
0:10:20,352 --> 0:10:21,586
like he knew what to do.


276
0:10:21,586 --> 0:10:24,556
He was trying to
cut himself off.


277
0:10:24,556 --> 0:10:26,458
Probably a 30 year old fish.


278
0:10:26,458 --> 0:10:30,996
It's not his first rodeo,
he had been hooked before.


279
0:10:30,996 --> 0:10:32,531
Scott: He just took back
everything I grabbed.


280
0:10:32,531 --> 0:10:35,67
Blair: Pure power right there.


281
0:10:35,67 --> 0:10:36,501
Kevin: Still going?


282
0:10:36,501 --> 0:10:38,57
I can't let him
go under the boat.


283
0:10:38,57 --> 0:10:40,472
He wasn't ready to die.


284
0:10:40,472 --> 0:10:47,646
Take him now.


285
0:10:47,646 --> 0:10:48,547
Got him.


286
0:10:48,547 --> 0:10:49,781
Scott: Come on,
get the tail rope.


287
0:10:49,781 --> 0:10:52,818
Get the tail rope.


288
0:10:52,818 --> 0:11:1,126
Kevin: He's pulling
away from us.


289
0:11:1,126 --> 0:11:4,696
Man: Put it in
reverse, reverse.


290
0:11:4,696 --> 0:11:8,366
Come on, pull it ahead.


291
0:11:8,366 --> 0:11:9,634
Kevin: Got him.


292
0:11:9,634 --> 0:11:11,503
That is a beast, my boys.


293
0:11:11,503 --> 0:11:12,17
Scott: Where'd
you come from?


294
0:11:12,17 --> 0:11:13,605
Kevin: Whoo!


295
0:11:13,605 --> 0:11:15,44
All right.


296
0:11:15,44 --> 0:11:16,875
Scott: That's above
average, Rich.


297
0:11:16,875 --> 0:11:18,777
Kevin: That's
why we do this.


298
0:11:18,777 --> 0:11:20,746
Blair: That is gonna
be all of 900 pounds.


299
0:11:20,746 --> 0:11:22,781
Kevin: That's my
grander right there.


300
0:11:22,781 --> 0:11:24,683
I gotta give you a hug.


301
0:11:24,683 --> 0:11:25,984
Whoo hoo.


302
0:11:25,984 --> 0:11:27,619
Scott: Let's get
him in the boat.


303
0:11:27,619 --> 0:11:30,255
Kevin: We open the door
and we slid him in.


304
0:11:30,255 --> 0:11:31,923
Pull.


305
0:11:31,923 --> 0:11:33,191
Pull!


306
0:11:33,191 --> 0:11:38,63
(Bleep), look at that boy!


307
0:11:38,63 --> 0:11:40,132
And we were all in awe.


308
0:11:40,132 --> 0:11:42,701
I said, this is the biggest
one I've ever caught.


309
0:11:42,701 --> 0:11:45,937
Ohh!


310
0:11:45,937 --> 0:11:47,305
I think we need
a bigger boat.


311
0:11:47,305 --> 0:11:50,41
If anybody was to catch
that, it's a trophy.


312
0:11:50,41 --> 0:11:52,611
I'm gonna call it an
eleven hundred pound fish.


313
0:11:52,611 --> 0:11:57,82
This is gonna cash in
between 10 and 15 grand.


314
0:11:57,82 --> 0:11:58,817
That's all that it's all
about, the big fish.


315
0:11:58,817 --> 0:12:1,19
You know, people talk about
the glorious and the big


316
0:12:1,19 --> 0:12:2,187
ones.


317
0:12:2,187 --> 0:12:7,759
You know, it's not
in the numbers.


318
0:12:7,759 --> 0:12:8,293
Dave: Come in.


319
0:12:8,293 --> 0:12:11,53
You guys there?


320
0:12:11,53 --> 0:12:12,697
Hey, where you guys at?


321
0:12:12,697 --> 0:12:15,2
Come in.


322
0:12:15,2 --> 0:12:16,968
They're not answering.


323
0:12:16,968 --> 0:12:17,869
Bill: It was a big boy.


324
0:12:17,869 --> 0:12:19,304
It was jumbo.


325
0:12:19,304 --> 0:12:22,841
And, uh, we couldn't
time it just right.


326
0:12:22,841 --> 0:12:24,676
Hey, good going.


327
0:12:24,676 --> 0:12:26,578
Big one?


328
0:12:26,578 --> 0:12:28,747
Kevin: Oh yeah,
she's a beast.


329
0:12:28,747 --> 0:12:30,348
A thousand pounds at least.


330
0:12:30,348 --> 0:12:31,95
Bill: Woo.


331
0:12:31,95 --> 0:12:32,784
Awesome.


332
0:12:32,784 --> 0:12:33,418
Real good.


333
0:12:33,418 --> 0:12:34,219
Good going.


334
0:12:34,219 --> 0:12:35,187
Donna: Good job, Kevin.


335
0:12:35,187 --> 0:12:37,88
Kevin: Thanks a lot, Bill.


336
0:12:37,88 --> 0:12:39,324
Bill: Yeah, we had him
here a minute ago and, uh,


337
0:12:39,324 --> 0:12:40,892
couldn't get him hooked.


338
0:12:40,892 --> 0:12:43,862
Pretty big, pretty big
mark too, you know.


339
0:12:43,862 --> 0:12:45,764
Kevin: Yeah, we had this guy
up to the boat like two or


340
0:12:45,764 --> 0:12:48,366
three times then he'd just
go right to the bottom.


341
0:12:48,366 --> 0:12:50,702
We were getting ready to
leave and dumped a bunch of


342
0:12:50,702 --> 0:12:52,904
chum and he showed up.


343
0:12:52,904 --> 0:12:53,438
Dave: Come in.


344
0:12:53,438 --> 0:12:56,875
You guys there?


345
0:12:56,875 --> 0:12:57,542
Bill: Good going, Kevin.


346
0:12:57,542 --> 0:13:1,179
At least it wasn't Dave.


347
0:13:1,179 --> 0:13:2,714
Dave: He still
ain't gonna answer.


348
0:13:2,714 --> 0:13:8,22
I give up.


349
0:13:8,22 --> 0:13:10,722
Marciano: Kevin, that guy
in the Christina, yeah,


350
0:13:10,722 --> 0:13:13,658
that guy.


351
0:13:13,658 --> 0:13:16,461
You know we heard he had an
eleven hundred pound fish.


352
0:13:16,461 --> 0:13:18,496
On the one hand, it's
like good for Kevin.


353
0:13:18,496 --> 0:13:20,232
But on the other
hand, you know,


354
0:13:20,232 --> 0:13:23,935
that's a bigger fish than
we've caught in this season.


355
0:13:23,935 --> 0:13:25,203
We're still in the game.


356
0:13:25,203 --> 0:13:27,606
We know how to catch
twelve hundred pounders,


357
0:13:27,606 --> 0:13:34,346
and we're gonna
do one today.


358
0:13:34,346 --> 0:13:36,248
Dave: Hey, you there, Kevin?


359
0:13:36,248 --> 0:13:36,648
Kevin: Yo.


360
0:13:36,648 --> 0:13:37,682
Come in.


361
0:13:37,682 --> 0:13:39,17
Dave: How was it?


362
0:13:39,17 --> 0:13:40,986
How big was he?


363
0:13:40,986 --> 0:13:43,121
Kevin: Ah, he's in the boat.


364
0:13:43,121 --> 0:13:44,422
118 inches.


365
0:13:44,422 --> 0:13:45,757
Paul: Nice.


366
0:13:45,757 --> 0:13:47,292
Dave: That's a
nice 118 inches.


367
0:13:47,292 --> 0:13:48,126
That's.


368
0:13:48,126 --> 0:13:48,994
Paul: That's a
big fish, dude.


369
0:13:48,994 --> 0:13:50,128
Dave: That's a
big fish there.


370
0:13:50,128 --> 0:13:52,931
Paul: That's as long
as the stern, dude.


371
0:13:52,931 --> 0:13:55,533
Dave: 118 inches
is a big fish.


372
0:13:55,533 --> 0:13:57,636
Paul: 10 feet long.


373
0:13:57,636 --> 0:13:59,237
Dave: That's a big boy.


374
0:13:59,237 --> 0:14:0,272
I'd like to see a
couple more of those.


375
0:14:0,272 --> 0:14:3,308
Good for him.


376
0:14:3,308 --> 0:14:5,76
Good for him.


377
0:14:5,76 --> 0:14:7,512
Paul: He was (bleep)
beside himself.


378
0:14:7,512 --> 0:14:8,947
We were very envious of him.


379
0:14:8,947 --> 0:14:18,69
That was a big (bleep).


380
0:14:18,69 --> 0:14:20,358
Rick: That is the biggest
fish that we've seen all


381
0:14:20,358 --> 0:14:21,126
year.


382
0:14:21,126 --> 0:14:22,46
That's huge.


383
0:14:22,46 --> 0:14:25,864
Kevin: I've fished with
Blair for probably 20 years,


384
0:14:25,864 --> 0:14:27,198
and we both gave the nod.


385
0:14:27,198 --> 0:14:30,168
We knew it, we knew it
was, this was a slammer.


386
0:14:30,168 --> 0:14:33,438
He made a turn, came by the
boat, and we, we all said,


387
0:14:33,438 --> 0:14:38,276
"Holy (bleep)," and it's
something that we've fished


388
0:14:38,276 --> 0:14:42,881
our whole lives to catch a
fish of that, of that size.


389
0:14:42,881 --> 0:14:45,25
Rick: Far and few of these
fish come across the boards.


390
0:14:45,25 --> 0:14:47,185
And we're looking at a,
you know, a 15,000


391
0:14:47,185 --> 0:14:48,453
dollar fish right now.


392
0:14:48,453 --> 0:14:50,455
15,000, 18,000 dollar fish.


393
0:14:50,455 --> 0:14:51,389
That's.


394
0:14:51,389 --> 0:14:52,324
Kevin: It's like
catching three, right?


395
0:14:52,324 --> 0:14:53,425
Rick: Right, it's
like catching three.


396
0:14:53,425 --> 0:14:56,194
A sizable fish like this,
and the beauty and the


397
0:14:56,194 --> 0:14:58,697
quality of this fish, I, I
feel that you can do real


398
0:14:58,697 --> 0:14:59,831
well.


399
0:14:59,831 --> 0:15:1,66
Think you'll really raise
the bar at the auction.


400
0:15:1,66 --> 0:15:3,401
This, this, this is a fish
that we certainly want to


401
0:15:3,401 --> 0:15:7,973
get to Tokyo as
soon as possible.


402
0:15:7,973 --> 0:15:11,676
Bill: Oh, yeah,
that's a big boy.


403
0:15:11,676 --> 0:15:12,477
Ohh!


404
0:15:12,477 --> 0:15:13,211
Donna: Ooh, hoo, hoo.


405
0:15:13,211 --> 0:15:21,453
Nice job, Kev!


406
0:15:21,453 --> 0:15:24,723
That was worth
waiting for, Kev.


407
0:15:24,723 --> 0:15:26,992
Rick: It's a
thousand pound fish.


408
0:15:26,992 --> 0:15:29,194
Biggest fish I've
seen all year.


409
0:15:29,194 --> 0:15:31,529
Sammy: Big fish,
with a little hook.


410
0:15:31,529 --> 0:15:33,865
I told these guys
earlier in the day,


411
0:15:33,865 --> 0:15:37,435
"Elephants eat peanuts."


412
0:15:37,435 --> 0:15:38,169
Man: Okay.


413
0:15:38,169 --> 0:15:40,672
Easy.


414
0:15:40,672 --> 0:15:44,442
This is just gonna fit.


415
0:15:44,442 --> 0:15:45,577
Rick: Kevin,
congratulations.


416
0:15:45,577 --> 0:15:47,445
That's the biggest fish of
the year, dressed weight,


417
0:15:47,445 --> 0:15:49,14
here at Compass Seafood.


418
0:15:49,14 --> 0:15:49,714
Great job.


419
0:15:49,714 --> 0:15:50,815
Great job.


420
0:15:50,815 --> 0:15:54,786
Man: Biggest by 400 pounds.


421
0:15:54,786 --> 0:15:56,621
Rick: Word will travel real
quick about this fish being


422
0:15:56,621 --> 0:15:58,823
landed tonight throughout
town and it'll get everyone


423
0:15:58,823 --> 0:16:0,859
hot and hungry again, to go
back out and try to catch


424
0:16:0,859 --> 0:16:3,595
one of these giants.


425
0:16:3,595 --> 0:16:4,662
Kevin: All right.


426
0:16:4,662 --> 0:16:5,163
I'll buy.


427
0:16:5,163 --> 0:16:10,101
Who flies?


428
0:16:10,101 --> 0:16:11,302
Dave: We're just gonna
spend the night here.


429
0:16:11,302 --> 0:16:12,737
It's such a perfect night.


430
0:16:12,737 --> 0:16:16,441
Winds are five knots, so the
radar running for the night.


431
0:16:16,441 --> 0:16:17,976
I'll fish a couple
more hours anyway,


432
0:16:17,976 --> 0:16:20,812
and wrap it up, and,
uh, wait for sunup.


433
0:16:20,812 --> 0:16:22,447
That's the game plan.


434
0:16:22,447 --> 0:16:25,65
Paul: Now, Dave is obsessed
with beating Kevin.


435
0:16:25,65 --> 0:16:28,987
It was like someone
(bleep) flicked a switch.


436
0:16:28,987 --> 0:16:32,891
He turned into this (bleep)
crazed (bleep) robot.


437
0:16:32,891 --> 0:16:34,392
Dave: Oh, we gotta
catch a (bleep) fish.


438
0:16:34,392 --> 0:16:37,395
Paul: He was like, "I don't
even want an 800-pounder.


439
0:16:37,395 --> 0:16:40,432
I want a 1.200-pounder or
I don't even want one."


440
0:16:40,432 --> 0:16:43,301
Dave: We're long overdue,
it's, uh, it's time.


441
0:16:43,301 --> 0:16:44,569
It's time for it
to happen for us.


442
0:16:44,569 --> 0:17:0,585
Hopefully, tomorrow
will be the day.


443
0:17:0,585 --> 0:17:2,587
Dave: Out here in day two.


444
0:17:2,587 --> 0:17:7,225
Just got word from Kevin
his fish was 1,075 pounds.


445
0:17:7,225 --> 0:17:8,993
That's a, that's
a big ass fish,


446
0:17:8,993 --> 0:17:10,829
that's all I could
say about that.


447
0:17:10,829 --> 0:17:12,43
Paul: Dave wants to get a
bigger fish than Kevin.


448
0:17:12,43 --> 0:17:13,765
He couldn't even sleep.


449
0:17:13,765 --> 0:17:16,668
And then when we get up,
he was (bleep) exhausted,


450
0:17:16,668 --> 0:17:22,14
'cause he stayed
awake all that night.


451
0:17:22,14 --> 0:17:23,675
Dave: Definitely under
pressure to get one today


452
0:17:23,675 --> 0:17:24,709
after Kevin got that one.


453
0:17:24,709 --> 0:17:26,1
Can't come home
empty handed now,


454
0:17:26,1 --> 0:17:27,712
he'll be rubbing
it in my face.


455
0:17:27,712 --> 0:17:30,81
Paul: It was really hard for
Dave 'cause he's used to


456
0:17:30,81 --> 0:17:32,584
being the number one boat.


457
0:17:32,584 --> 0:17:37,422
And now Kevin got this
thousand fifty pounder,


458
0:17:37,422 --> 0:17:39,424
and it just made him twitch.


459
0:17:39,424 --> 0:17:41,392
I made him freak out.


460
0:17:41,392 --> 0:17:43,761
Dave: All I know is I want
to get the biggest fish out


461
0:17:43,761 --> 0:17:45,63
of this group this year.


462
0:17:45,63 --> 0:17:47,398
Paul: We just need
'em to make a mistake.


463
0:17:47,398 --> 0:17:49,667
Dave: (Bleep) them,
(bleep) them all.


464
0:17:49,667 --> 0:17:51,69
Everybody's
giving me (bleep),


465
0:17:51,69 --> 0:17:52,704
but I want the (bleep)
biggest one in the fleet


466
0:17:52,704 --> 0:17:54,606
this year.


467
0:17:54,606 --> 0:17:55,94
And we're gonna
(bleep) get him.


468
0:17:55,94 --> 0:17:59,344
Paul: That was cool to see
him amped up like that.


469
0:17:59,344 --> 0:18:0,979
That's what you want.


470
0:18:0,979 --> 0:18:4,15
You want the guy that's
running the boat to (bleep)


471
0:18:4,15 --> 0:18:5,383
be amped up like that.


472
0:18:5,383 --> 0:18:7,785
You want to give him
a kick in the (bleep).


473
0:18:7,785 --> 0:18:10,455
Dave: I want to be on top.


474
0:18:10,455 --> 0:18:16,227
And we're gonna
(bleep) get him.


475
0:18:16,227 --> 0:18:17,529
Marciano: All we've been
doing at this point is


476
0:18:17,529 --> 0:18:18,73
surviving this season.


477
0:18:18,73 --> 0:18:20,932
We keep, we get a few, and
then we fish for a while and


478
0:18:20,932 --> 0:18:22,66
don't get more.


479
0:18:22,66 --> 0:18:24,302
We get a few and then we
don't that's just survival


480
0:18:24,302 --> 0:18:25,336
mode for us.


481
0:18:25,336 --> 0:18:27,338
We're not really getting
ahead at that level.


482
0:18:27,338 --> 0:18:30,241
What really needs to happen
is we need to go right back


483
0:18:30,241 --> 0:18:33,111
out there now after landing,
and keep catching those


484
0:18:33,111 --> 0:18:34,78
fish.


485
0:18:34,78 --> 0:18:37,482
And that's how I get
ahead of the game.


486
0:18:37,482 --> 0:18:39,551
Steve: You got a, a charter
this weekend, Dave, or?


487
0:18:39,551 --> 0:18:41,819
Marciano: Yeah, the, the
last one coming up for the


488
0:18:41,819 --> 0:18:43,54
season, yeah.


489
0:18:43,54 --> 0:18:45,957
We'll take the, uh, little
bit of extra bling.


490
0:18:45,957 --> 0:18:48,59
Come on, it's like a kid in
a candy store here, right?


491
0:18:48,59 --> 0:18:50,161
I keep wandering around.


492
0:18:50,161 --> 0:18:51,729
My wife hates it
when I go here.


493
0:18:51,729 --> 0:18:53,765
You know, I finally
get desperate.


494
0:18:53,765 --> 0:18:55,967
I finally agree to
do a few charters.


495
0:18:55,967 --> 0:18:57,502
You guys want to go fishing?


496
0:18:57,502 --> 0:18:59,337
Put, put some
money in my hand?


497
0:18:59,337 --> 0:19:1,639
I'll take you out
fishing for the day.


498
0:19:1,639 --> 0:19:4,175
Okay.


499
0:19:4,175 --> 0:19:5,81
Steve: We'll worry about the
tab later and we'll just


500
0:19:5,81 --> 0:19:6,744
take care of this, then?


501
0:19:6,744 --> 0:19:8,279
Marciano: Yeah, all right.


502
0:19:8,279 --> 0:19:10,481
Steve: 18 once, twice.


503
0:19:10,481 --> 0:19:11,716
11.


504
0:19:11,716 --> 0:19:16,721
19, nine, nine, 10 once.


505
0:19:16,721 --> 0:19:18,756
10 twice.


506
0:19:18,756 --> 0:19:19,657
Marciano: Here's
the painful part.


507
0:19:19,657 --> 0:19:21,659
Steve: $117.94.


508
0:19:21,659 --> 0:19:22,56
Marciano: Remember,


509
0:19:22,56 --> 0:19:24,929
if my wife stops
in, I only spent 17.


510
0:19:24,929 --> 0:19:26,831
Steve: I think, sure,
wanna pay her tab?


511
0:19:26,831 --> 0:19:28,766
Marciano: Oh, man, come on.


512
0:19:28,766 --> 0:19:29,934
You're killing me.


513
0:19:29,934 --> 0:19:31,269
What is her tab?


514
0:19:31,269 --> 0:19:33,504
Steve: It's $487.50.


515
0:19:33,504 --> 0:19:36,274
Marciano: Who, wha-, what?


516
0:19:36,274 --> 0:19:37,442
Steve: Four hundred and
eighty seven dollars and


517
0:19:37,442 --> 0:19:38,276
fifty cents.


518
0:19:38,276 --> 0:19:41,479
Just, 487's good
for me, buddy.


519
0:19:41,479 --> 0:19:42,48
Marciano: That's it.


520
0:19:42,48 --> 0:19:43,248
You get it all.


521
0:19:43,248 --> 0:19:43,848
Steve: I get it all, huh?


522
0:19:43,848 --> 0:19:44,549
Marciano: I get nothing.


523
0:19:44,549 --> 0:19:45,283
Steve: Thanks, buddy.


524
0:19:45,283 --> 0:19:46,284
Marciano: I get receipts.


525
0:19:46,284 --> 0:20:7,905
And I thought tuna
fishing was expensive.


526
0:20:7,905 --> 0:20:12,76
Kevin: Dave and myself
are very competitive.


527
0:20:12,76 --> 0:20:14,245
I know he's a little
jealous right now.


528
0:20:14,245 --> 0:20:15,647
He's been humbled.


529
0:20:15,647 --> 0:20:17,48
Humbled and hobbled.


530
0:20:17,48 --> 0:20:19,25
There's not a day in my life
with Dave that we don't


531
0:20:19,25 --> 0:20:21,352
compete one way or another.


532
0:20:21,352 --> 0:20:29,46
Size matters.


533
0:20:29,46 --> 0:20:31,629
Sandro: The (bleep) you
gotta do to catch tuna.


534
0:20:31,629 --> 0:20:32,23
It's ridiculous.


535
0:20:32,23 --> 0:20:34,65
Paul: That's right.


536
0:20:34,65 --> 0:20:35,733
Dave: Now we're
gonna pretty much,


537
0:20:35,733 --> 0:20:37,235
pretty much kind of fish the
same way today as we did


538
0:20:37,235 --> 0:20:38,97
yesterday and all
the other days.


539
0:20:38,97 --> 0:20:40,305
Only nothing,
nothing different.


540
0:20:40,305 --> 0:20:41,372
You just got to be in the
right place at the right


541
0:20:41,372 --> 0:20:43,908
time, and have the right
fish here, that's all.


542
0:20:43,908 --> 0:20:45,943
Paul: Hopefully
we can get lucky.


543
0:20:45,943 --> 0:20:47,245
Dave: Exactly.


544
0:20:47,245 --> 0:20:49,38
Kevin had a beauty,
no doubt about it.


545
0:20:49,38 --> 0:20:52,183
Paul: The biggest one ever.


546
0:20:52,183 --> 0:20:54,719
Dave: That's his, that's
his biggest fish, for sure.


547
0:20:54,719 --> 0:20:56,387
Paul: I haven't caught a
(bleep) eleven hundred


548
0:20:56,387 --> 0:21:0,591
pounder in 25 years.


549
0:21:0,591 --> 0:21:4,195
I haven't caught a thousand
pounder in 20 years.


550
0:21:4,195 --> 0:21:5,73
Dave: Hey, you there, Kev?


551
0:21:5,73 --> 0:21:6,931
Kevin: Yeah, come in.


552
0:21:6,931 --> 0:21:9,767
Dave: That thing had to be
fat as, fat as it was, uh,


553
0:21:9,767 --> 0:21:11,35
as long.


554
0:21:11,35 --> 0:21:13,4
Kevin: Could barely, barely
fit through the door.


555
0:21:13,4 --> 0:21:14,172
Dave: Really?


556
0:21:14,172 --> 0:21:15,106
Yeah, it's gonna be a few
years before you beat that


557
0:21:15,106 --> 0:21:17,475
one.


558
0:21:17,475 --> 0:21:21,813
That was your first, first
grander plus, in 27 years.


559
0:21:21,813 --> 0:21:25,983
Sandro, his first fish,
was eleven hundred.


560
0:21:25,983 --> 0:21:27,752
Kevin: Unbelievable.


561
0:21:27,752 --> 0:21:29,821
Dave: All right, well, I'm
gonna go back to work.


562
0:21:29,821 --> 0:21:30,855
Kevin: Hey, hey.


563
0:21:30,855 --> 0:21:31,923
Dave: I was just
saying to Kevin,


564
0:21:31,923 --> 0:21:33,591
it took him 27 years
to catch his first


565
0:21:33,591 --> 0:21:34,659
1,000-pounder.


566
0:21:34,659 --> 0:21:37,128
Sandro comes out
with me on his,


567
0:21:37,128 --> 0:21:39,43
one of his first maiden
voyages on this boat and,


568
0:21:39,43 --> 0:21:42,867
uh, his first giant tuna
was eleven hundred pounds.


569
0:21:42,867 --> 0:21:44,736
So, quite a big disparity.


570
0:21:44,736 --> 0:21:48,39
27 years to catch the first
one and Sandro catches one


571
0:21:48,39 --> 0:21:51,42
eleven hundred
pounds the first day.


572
0:21:51,42 --> 0:21:54,579
Yeah, man, I want a bigger
one now than I have all year


573
0:21:54,579 --> 0:21:58,983
because Kevin got one.


574
0:21:58,983 --> 0:22:1,919
Kevin: So the
drama continues.


575
0:22:1,919 --> 0:22:3,454
Davy.


576
0:22:3,454 --> 0:22:5,523
There's a lot of jealousy.


577
0:22:5,523 --> 0:22:6,758
I mean, that's
the bottom line.


578
0:22:6,758 --> 0:22:10,61
If you're catching fish,
and the other guy isn't,


579
0:22:10,61 --> 0:22:12,196
he can't help
but be jealous.


580
0:22:12,196 --> 0:22:14,332
Dave is absolutely sour.


581
0:22:14,332 --> 0:22:15,466
Scott: Beside himself.


582
0:22:15,466 --> 0:22:18,302
Kevin: About not having
a bigger fish than us.


583
0:22:18,302 --> 0:22:22,44
Size matters, Davy boy.


584
0:22:22,44 --> 0:22:26,43
Kevin: He didn't break the
thousand mark this year.


585
0:22:26,43 --> 0:22:28,98
And we got one.


586
0:22:28,98 --> 0:22:30,47
Yeah, you still there Dave?


587
0:22:30,47 --> 0:22:33,551
Come in.


588
0:22:33,551 --> 0:22:36,154
Dave: Well yeah, only did
see on fish there and that


589
0:22:36,154 --> 0:22:38,55
was at, uh, first light.


590
0:22:38,55 --> 0:22:39,657
And that was it.


591
0:22:39,657 --> 0:22:42,59
Marciano: We were sitting
there at prime time and


592
0:22:42,59 --> 0:22:44,529
we're hoping them big, fat
slobs come back through and


593
0:22:44,529 --> 0:22:46,23
cooperate.


594
0:22:46,23 --> 0:22:47,465
Dave: Got to do something.


595
0:22:47,465 --> 0:22:49,1
I'm getting kind of burned
out just (bleep) sitting in


596
0:22:49,1 --> 0:22:50,268
one spot.


597
0:22:50,268 --> 0:22:52,17
Nothing happening, you know?


598
0:22:52,17 --> 0:22:53,704
Should be doing
better than this.


599
0:22:53,704 --> 0:22:55,139
Marciano: Yeah, yeah.


600
0:22:55,139 --> 0:22:56,908
Yeah, I hear you.


601
0:22:56,908 --> 0:22:57,942
Dave: Oh, man.


602
0:22:57,942 --> 0:23:0,278
Well, I'm gonna fish
through this tide here.


603
0:23:0,278 --> 0:23:2,447
I'll be out of here
shortly thereafter.


604
0:23:2,447 --> 0:23:3,347
Good luck.


605
0:23:3,347 --> 0:23:4,882
I'll chat with you
in a few minutes.


606
0:23:4,882 --> 0:23:6,784
Marciano: Standing by.


607
0:23:6,784 --> 0:23:9,887
Kevin gets lucky, gets a
wicked slob, (bleep) yeah,


608
0:23:9,887 --> 0:23:17,795
I want to catch a
bigger fish than him.


609
0:23:17,795 --> 0:23:21,699
All right, so we got Davy
Dot Com up ahead of us.


610
0:23:21,699 --> 0:23:24,168
Now, Wilson, I want you to
be paying attention up here


611
0:23:24,168 --> 0:23:26,637
while I'm back there
getting these rigs out,


612
0:23:26,637 --> 0:23:28,906
make damn sure you let me
know if you start to see a


613
0:23:28,906 --> 0:23:31,242
few fish.


614
0:23:31,242 --> 0:23:33,11
It's gonna hurt him a lot
more than it's gonna hurt


615
0:23:33,11 --> 0:23:38,249
me.


616
0:23:38,249 --> 0:23:39,55
There's a bunch
of fish here.


617
0:23:39,55 --> 0:23:45,556
Any rod could go any minute.


618
0:23:45,556 --> 0:23:46,29
There he is.


619
0:23:46,29 --> 0:23:52,163
We're on!


620
0:23:52,163 --> 0:23:55,233
We definitely got a tuna
fish on the line here.


621
0:23:55,233 --> 0:23:58,336
Let's just hope he makes the
grade to be a sellable fish.


622
0:23:58,336 --> 0:24:6,811
The legal limit is
73 inches or greater.


623
0:24:6,811 --> 0:24:10,81
Let me have a good
look at you, son.


624
0:24:10,81 --> 0:24:16,287
He's awful close.


625
0:24:16,287 --> 0:24:20,625
Nah, he's not a keeper.


626
0:24:20,625 --> 0:24:21,993
Right species.


627
0:24:21,993 --> 0:24:24,829
Wrong size.


628
0:24:24,829 --> 0:24:29,5
Gonna do a quick
release job here.


629
0:24:29,5 --> 0:24:30,902
There he is.


630
0:24:30,902 --> 0:24:31,402
You know?


631
0:24:31,402 --> 0:24:32,136
So that's it.


632
0:24:32,136 --> 0:24:33,271
We got a short.


633
0:24:33,271 --> 0:24:35,39
Again, not what
we're here to target.


634
0:24:35,39 --> 0:24:38,442
But, uh, it would be illegal
for me to sell that fish.


635
0:24:38,442 --> 0:24:39,71
He's too short.


636
0:24:39,71 --> 0:24:43,614
The legal limit for a giant
bluefin tuna is 73 inches or


637
0:24:43,614 --> 0:24:44,549
greater.


638
0:24:44,549 --> 0:24:47,18
That fish there
falls into the, uh,


639
0:24:47,18 --> 0:24:51,22
small medium bluefin
tuna category.


640
0:24:51,22 --> 0:24:51,822
Jay: You know, it's
a disappointment;


641
0:24:51,822 --> 0:24:53,691
no meat for the boat.


642
0:24:53,691 --> 0:24:57,528
But, uh, at least we know
the tuna are biting.


643
0:24:57,528 --> 0:25:0,64
Just not the big tuna.


644
0:25:0,64 --> 0:25:1,532
Marciano: Well we just
(bleep) haven't been having


645
0:25:1,532 --> 0:25:2,567
a good year.


646
0:25:2,567 --> 0:25:5,102
I (bleep) pissing
money away,


647
0:25:5,102 --> 0:25:8,306
(bleep) hand over fist.


648
0:25:8,306 --> 0:25:10,41
It just, you know, this
has been the worst (bleep)


649
0:25:10,41 --> 0:25:14,278
season I've ever
(bleep) had doing this.


650
0:25:14,278 --> 0:25:14,912
Jay: Yeah.


651
0:25:14,912 --> 0:25:15,913
Right now it just sucks.


652
0:25:15,913 --> 0:25:18,95
It feels like we can't
do anything right.


653
0:25:18,95 --> 0:25:20,484
Enough is enough.


654
0:25:20,484 --> 0:25:22,119
Captain decides to go home.


655
0:25:22,119 --> 0:25:23,854
You know, we're gonna come
out tomorrow and put the


656
0:25:23,854 --> 0:25:26,19
hooks back in the
water and hopefully,


657
0:25:26,19 --> 0:25:27,825
we can get that right bite.


658
0:25:27,825 --> 0:25:29,93
Get that week's check.


659
0:25:29,93 --> 0:25:30,328
You know?


660
0:25:30,328 --> 0:25:32,797
Get that thousand
pounder, hopefully.


661
0:25:32,797 --> 0:25:47,678
The Hard Merchandise
will be on the fish.


662
0:25:47,678 --> 0:25:49,18
Dave: Good morning.


663
0:25:49,18 --> 0:25:50,181
Sandro: Yo.


664
0:25:50,181 --> 0:25:51,148
Dave: Yeah, let's get
out of here quick.


665
0:25:51,148 --> 0:25:54,85
Uh, catch a couple
fish hopefully, and,


666
0:25:54,85 --> 0:25:55,987
we got to beat Kevin.


667
0:25:55,987 --> 0:25:56,988
Sandro: Be the biggest fin.


668
0:25:56,988 --> 0:25:57,655
Dave: You ready?


669
0:25:57,655 --> 0:25:58,589
Sandro: Let's get it done.


670
0:25:58,589 --> 0:25:59,223
Dave: Come on.


671
0:25:59,223 --> 0:26:0,391
One big jumbo today.


672
0:26:0,391 --> 0:26:1,125
Sandro: Yeah, right.


673
0:26:1,125 --> 0:26:2,326
Dave: 1,038 whatever it is.


674
0:26:2,326 --> 0:26:4,261
Sandro: Thousand
thirty-eight.


675
0:26:4,261 --> 0:26:5,396
Paul: And you
know what Kevin?


676
0:26:5,396 --> 0:26:7,131
Back the (bleep) up.


677
0:26:7,131 --> 0:26:17,241
Here we come.


678
0:26:17,241 --> 0:26:20,878
Jay: Who wants a nice
gourmet breakfast?


679
0:26:20,878 --> 0:26:23,581
Anybody up for a
gourmet breakfast?


680
0:26:23,581 --> 0:26:24,615
Man: Yeah, I'd love
one, yeah, yeah.


681
0:26:24,615 --> 0:26:25,516
Marciano: The season
wasn't going well.


682
0:26:25,516 --> 0:26:26,917
I had to do something.


683
0:26:26,917 --> 0:26:29,954
So I had an opportunity
to grab this charter.


684
0:26:29,954 --> 0:26:31,422
Jay: Remember, nice and slow
so you don't rip it out of


685
0:26:31,422 --> 0:26:33,424
his mouth.


686
0:26:33,424 --> 0:26:35,726
Marciano: The whole idea of
a charter is these guys are


687
0:26:35,726 --> 0:26:38,462
hiring me for the
opportunity to come out and


688
0:26:38,462 --> 0:26:40,97
catch a few fish.


689
0:26:40,97 --> 0:26:42,366
It's not something
I normally do.


690
0:26:42,366 --> 0:26:45,69
Call me a slut, but they
offered me money for me to


691
0:26:45,69 --> 0:26:46,47
take 'em out fishing.


692
0:26:46,47 --> 0:26:48,272
I'll do what I got to do.


693
0:26:48,272 --> 0:26:49,707
Yeah, you can whip a
few flounders up there,


694
0:26:49,707 --> 0:26:53,31
though white side up.


695
0:26:53,31 --> 0:26:54,11
Man: Like that?


696
0:26:54,11 --> 0:26:55,446
Marciano: Yeah.


697
0:26:55,446 --> 0:26:56,881
And then we'll do
these flounders first,


698
0:26:56,881 --> 0:26:58,516
and then I'll do the cod.


699
0:26:58,516 --> 0:26:59,85
You know, it's nice
to have the charter.


700
0:26:59,85 --> 0:27:1,385
Its guaranteed income.


701
0:27:1,385 --> 0:27:3,587
Especially when tuna
fishing's slow.


702
0:27:3,587 --> 0:27:5,823
But then sometimes it's a
little frustrating 'cause


703
0:27:5,823 --> 0:27:7,892
that pulls me away
from the tuna game,


704
0:27:7,892 --> 0:27:9,894
right during prime time.


705
0:27:9,894 --> 0:27:11,862
You know, guys are looking
to catch some good eatin'


706
0:27:11,862 --> 0:27:13,3
fish for supper.


707
0:27:13,3 --> 0:27:14,265
You know?


708
0:27:14,265 --> 0:27:15,866
We have these beautiful cod
and haddock up here in New


709
0:27:15,866 --> 0:27:17,134
England.


710
0:27:17,134 --> 0:27:19,437
It's usually pretty easy to
go out and get a handful of


711
0:27:19,437 --> 0:27:21,872
cod and make
these guys happy.


712
0:27:21,872 --> 0:27:26,77
Jay: What we got here, we
got some nice big clams.


713
0:27:26,77 --> 0:27:29,313
You got to make sure your
baits got that black gook


714
0:27:29,313 --> 0:27:31,916
the haddock and cod and
pollock they like to suck on


715
0:27:31,916 --> 0:27:33,117
that.


716
0:27:33,117 --> 0:27:36,487
The more nastier it is, the
faster it's gonna work,


717
0:27:36,487 --> 0:27:39,23
and the faster you're gonna
hook that little fish.


718
0:27:39,23 --> 0:27:41,92
Marciano: I desperately
need this trip.


719
0:27:41,92 --> 0:27:43,828
This will give me a paycheck
and Jay a paycheck to keep


720
0:27:43,828 --> 0:27:51,168
us in the tuna game
a little bit longer.


721
0:27:51,168 --> 0:27:52,97
Dave: There'll be a bit
here in the next few days.


722
0:27:52,97 --> 0:27:54,238
Do you think so, Paul?


723
0:27:54,238 --> 0:27:55,473
Paul: I hope so.


724
0:27:55,473 --> 0:27:57,541
I hope it's this afternoon
will determine what's going


725
0:27:57,541 --> 0:28:0,144
on.


726
0:28:0,144 --> 0:28:2,98
The last few days have
really been bad luck.


727
0:28:2,98 --> 0:28:5,583
But, it happens.


728
0:28:5,583 --> 0:28:7,785
Sandro: I would love
an 800 pounder.


729
0:28:7,785 --> 0:28:8,753
Paul: Could, there's
always that chance,


730
0:28:8,753 --> 0:28:11,355
we've done really
good here this year.


731
0:28:11,355 --> 0:28:12,423
Dave: We're gonna
stay until dark,


732
0:28:12,423 --> 0:28:13,891
I don't care how
hard it blows.


733
0:28:13,891 --> 0:28:16,26
Especially with Kevin
getting that fish.


734
0:28:16,26 --> 0:28:18,362
It's imperative we come home
with something, anyway.


735
0:28:18,362 --> 0:28:20,931
I'm getting a
little burned out.


736
0:28:20,931 --> 0:28:23,134
Getting a little burned
out to say the least.


737
0:28:23,134 --> 0:28:24,235
Paul: Yep.


738
0:28:24,235 --> 0:28:25,636
Dave: Man, I'd love to see
something happen here,


739
0:28:25,636 --> 0:28:27,972
I really would.


740
0:28:27,972 --> 0:28:30,875
We caught a lot of
fish here this year.


741
0:28:30,875 --> 0:28:33,177
But it's not
happening right now.


742
0:28:33,177 --> 0:28:35,246
We'll blame it on Sandro.


743
0:28:35,246 --> 0:28:35,98
Paul: Yep.


744
0:28:35,98 --> 0:28:37,114
Just (bleep) everything up.


745
0:28:37,114 --> 0:28:37,848
Dave: It's all his fault.


746
0:28:37,848 --> 0:28:39,55
Right, Sandro?


747
0:28:39,55 --> 0:28:40,618
Sandro: (Bleep).


748
0:28:40,618 --> 0:28:41,619
Paul: Aah.


749
0:28:41,619 --> 0:28:42,553
Dave: Look, aah, you can't.


750
0:28:42,553 --> 0:28:45,623
Paul: He can't even
hold his, chum.


751
0:28:45,623 --> 0:28:46,624
Paul: You got one?


752
0:28:46,624 --> 0:28:47,458
Dave: You got one?


753
0:28:47,458 --> 0:28:48,92
Crank it.


754
0:28:48,92 --> 0:28:48,726
Something's on there.


755
0:28:48,726 --> 0:28:49,66
Paul: Something's going.


756
0:28:49,66 --> 0:28:50,661
You got him; don't
let him slack out.


757
0:28:50,661 --> 0:28:52,196
Dave: Crank, that's
tuna coming up.


758
0:28:52,196 --> 0:28:52,897
Paul: Yep.


759
0:28:52,897 --> 0:28:56,1
That's a tuna.


760
0:28:56,1 --> 0:28:57,968
Dave: It's what
it's all about.


761
0:28:57,968 --> 0:28:59,537
Paul: Keep him
tight there, rookie.


762
0:28:59,537 --> 0:29:2,573
Dave: Crank, crank.


763
0:29:2,573 --> 0:29:4,408
Come on.


764
0:29:4,408 --> 0:29:6,443
Always want to stay
ahead of the competition.


765
0:29:6,443 --> 0:29:8,312
Just by one.


766
0:29:8,312 --> 0:29:9,68
We're on the cliff,
right Sandro?


767
0:29:9,68 --> 0:29:10,748
Sandro: Yeah.


768
0:29:10,748 --> 0:29:12,683
Bend that rod.


769
0:29:12,683 --> 0:29:15,352
This is what it's
all about again.


770
0:29:15,352 --> 0:29:17,521
Crank, crank, come on.


771
0:29:17,521 --> 0:29:19,924
The competition continues.


772
0:29:19,924 --> 0:29:20,691
Sandro, stay on him.


773
0:29:20,691 --> 0:29:21,759
Stay on him.


774
0:29:21,759 --> 0:29:22,927
Here he comes.


775
0:29:22,927 --> 0:29:24,528
I almost got color.


776
0:29:24,528 --> 0:29:25,196
Grab that rope?


777
0:29:25,196 --> 0:29:26,897
Dave: Yeah, bitch.


778
0:29:26,897 --> 0:29:29,6
Aah, looks small,
maybe a small tuna.


779
0:29:29,6 --> 0:29:30,968
Small tuna or bluedog.


780
0:29:30,968 --> 0:29:31,702
Paul: I don't know; a seven
hundred pounder does the


781
0:29:31,702 --> 0:29:33,437
same thing.


782
0:29:33,437 --> 0:29:34,905
Dave: A little French fry.


783
0:29:34,905 --> 0:29:37,174
Paul: A (bleep) baby.


784
0:29:37,174 --> 0:29:39,109
Dave: Come on.


785
0:29:39,109 --> 0:29:40,411
Going on?


786
0:29:40,411 --> 0:29:41,378
There he is.


787
0:29:41,378 --> 0:29:42,313
Little rat.


788
0:29:42,313 --> 0:29:43,247
Paul: Throw it back.


789
0:29:43,247 --> 0:29:45,282
We don't want those
little (bleep).


790
0:29:45,282 --> 0:29:46,517
Small fish.


791
0:29:46,517 --> 0:29:49,52
It's just like a streak of
bad luck, that, it happens.


792
0:29:49,52 --> 0:29:50,921
Dave was pissed.


793
0:29:50,921 --> 0:29:51,755
(Bleep)!


794
0:29:51,755 --> 0:29:54,892
What the (Bleep)!


795
0:29:54,892 --> 0:29:56,527
Dave: Ah, not a (bleep) rat.


796
0:29:56,527 --> 0:29:59,29
Damnit a rat.


797
0:29:59,29 --> 0:30:5,102
Oh, man.


798
0:30:5,102 --> 0:30:6,237
Now what we want.


799
0:30:6,237 --> 0:30:7,238
Sandro: Look at
those huge fins.


800
0:30:7,238 --> 0:30:9,206
Look at that, it's giant.


801
0:30:9,206 --> 0:30:12,643
That fish there one day will
be a thousand-plus pounds.


802
0:30:12,643 --> 0:30:14,211
Look at the belly on him.


803
0:30:14,211 --> 0:30:18,582
Paul: Look how fat he is.


804
0:30:18,582 --> 0:30:22,219
Sandro: Alright,
you can let go.


805
0:30:22,219 --> 0:30:23,87
Dave: Good-bye.


806
0:30:23,87 --> 0:30:26,323
Paul: Yeah.


807
0:30:26,323 --> 0:30:27,591
Dave: Not even
close actually,


808
0:30:27,591 --> 0:30:29,894
we could've used
him for bait.


809
0:30:29,894 --> 0:30:30,527
Real small.


810
0:30:30,527 --> 0:30:31,795
They got to be 73 inches.


811
0:30:31,795 --> 0:30:32,963
Those are the regs.


812
0:30:32,963 --> 0:30:35,432
We follow 'em, so does
everybody else, pretty much.


813
0:30:35,432 --> 0:30:37,368
And, uh, let him go.


814
0:30:37,368 --> 0:30:39,47
Come back, get
him another day.


815
0:30:39,47 --> 0:30:40,671
Get him in another, what?


816
0:30:40,671 --> 0:30:42,606
Maybe five, six years?


817
0:30:42,606 --> 0:30:45,776
Paul: You give back to
you save the stocks.


818
0:30:45,776 --> 0:30:47,144
Keep the fishery alive.


819
0:30:47,144 --> 0:30:49,813
You don't want to kill
every little fish.


820
0:30:49,813 --> 0:30:52,716
You've gotta give back
to the sea, you know?


821
0:30:52,716 --> 0:30:53,784
It's good karma, too.


822
0:30:53,784 --> 0:30:57,154
God damn it.


823
0:30:57,154 --> 0:30:59,56
Dave: Definitely a
lot of fish around.


824
0:30:59,56 --> 0:31:0,557
Both the little ones
and the big ones.


825
0:31:0,557 --> 0:31:2,893
Unfortunately we can't
get the big ones to bite.


826
0:31:2,893 --> 0:31:4,161
I'm very competitive
in nature.


827
0:31:4,161 --> 0:31:5,396
You know, especially
with Kevin,


828
0:31:5,396 --> 0:31:8,432
and he's got us beat right
now and I want to beat him.


829
0:31:8,432 --> 0:31:21,445
I want to beat him
in the worst way.


830
0:31:21,445 --> 0:31:24,748
Donna: You want to put
the live guy in, or?


831
0:31:24,748 --> 0:31:28,18
Bill: Yeah, I was actually
thinking about it.


832
0:31:28,18 --> 0:31:30,988
Donna: Once in a while I
have dreams that are really


833
0:31:30,988 --> 0:31:34,158
whacked out about fishing.


834
0:31:34,158 --> 0:31:37,461
Dreamt one time that I was
tuna fishing off my front


835
0:31:37,461 --> 0:31:41,498
porch in a puddle, and
actually hooked up.


836
0:31:41,498 --> 0:31:42,66
Yeah.


837
0:31:42,66 --> 0:31:44,468
Rod was bent over.


838
0:31:44,468 --> 0:31:45,736
It was great.


839
0:31:45,736 --> 0:31:49,473
Scott: What
the hell is wrong with you?


840
0:31:49,473 --> 0:31:53,143
Donna: I told you, I'm
whacked out, I'm sick.


841
0:31:53,143 --> 0:31:54,78
Bill: I can't
make it happen.


842
0:31:54,78 --> 0:31:57,14
They just won't
get under the boat.


843
0:31:57,14 --> 0:31:57,715
Dave: I know.


844
0:31:57,715 --> 0:31:59,283
I feel for you, I do.


845
0:31:59,283 --> 0:32:0,15
We're rooting for you.


846
0:32:0,15 --> 0:32:2,82
Bill: You're a lying
sack of (bleep).


847
0:32:2,82 --> 0:32:3,62
Dave: Keep plugging away.


848
0:32:3,62 --> 0:32:5,389
I don't, I don't know.


849
0:32:5,389 --> 0:32:8,492
Donna: Again, getting to the
point where this is not a


850
0:32:8,492 --> 0:32:10,6
good habit to be in.


851
0:32:10,6 --> 0:32:12,563
Glad that Christina
got a fish.


852
0:32:12,563 --> 0:32:14,631
But, doesn't do me any good.


853
0:32:14,631 --> 0:32:17,735
I'm sure the mood on the
Christina is a whole lot


854
0:32:17,735 --> 0:32:29,68
better than the mood on the
Bounty Hunter right now.


855
0:32:29,68 --> 0:32:30,948
Kevin: We caught a big fish.


856
0:32:30,948 --> 0:32:33,83
It was almost eleven hundred
pounds and it could turn out


857
0:32:33,83 --> 0:32:34,985
to be the biggest
fish of the season.


858
0:32:34,985 --> 0:32:36,353
We're hot right now.


859
0:32:36,353 --> 0:32:37,454
We're here to do it again.


860
0:32:37,454 --> 0:32:39,189
I know the big
fish are feeding.


861
0:32:39,189 --> 0:32:40,958
And I know what
they're biting on.


862
0:32:40,958 --> 0:32:43,227
I think the best part of the
whole thing is knowing that


863
0:32:43,227 --> 0:32:51,135
it's killing Dave.


864
0:32:51,135 --> 0:32:53,303
Dave: Yeah, let her go.


865
0:32:53,303 --> 0:33:1,879
You're good.


866
0:33:1,879 --> 0:33:6,583
Let's go with the
fourth bridle.


867
0:33:6,583 --> 0:33:8,218
Hopefully we can
get something here.


868
0:33:8,218 --> 0:33:9,787
Paul: Kevin, we're
coming for you.


869
0:33:9,787 --> 0:33:11,688
We're gonna kick your
(bleep) (bleep),


870
0:33:11,688 --> 0:33:14,124
so watch the (bleep) out!


871
0:33:14,124 --> 0:33:16,326
Dave: Day's not over.


872
0:33:16,326 --> 0:33:25,135
Day's not over.


873
0:33:25,135 --> 0:33:27,104
Marciano: Today we've got
a charter aboard the boat,


874
0:33:27,104 --> 0:33:28,939
and it's a
double-edged sword.


875
0:33:28,939 --> 0:33:32,643
On the one hand, fifteen
hundred bucks is a pretty


876
0:33:32,643 --> 0:33:34,44
good chunk of change.


877
0:33:34,44 --> 0:33:36,98
On the other hand, I could
be out tuna fishing.


878
0:33:36,98 --> 0:33:41,251
And I could catch a fish
that's worth 10,000 dollars.


879
0:33:41,251 --> 0:33:43,32
We're doing a little bit
of cod fishing right now.


880
0:33:43,32 --> 0:33:44,555
So what we're
going to do is,


881
0:33:44,555 --> 0:33:46,123
we're gonna hope we can do
a little of both here today


882
0:33:46,123 --> 0:33:47,858
for these guys.


883
0:33:47,858 --> 0:33:49,393
While we're out there
with this charter,


884
0:33:49,393 --> 0:33:51,662
I'm gonna throw the tuna
rod over just for a little


885
0:33:51,662 --> 0:33:56,1
while, just to
see what happens.


886
0:33:56,1 --> 0:33:58,1
That movie The
Perfect Storm,


887
0:33:58,1 --> 0:34:0,27
I knew a few of those
guys on that boat.


888
0:34:0,27 --> 0:34:3,407
In particular,
that guy Sully.


889
0:34:3,407 --> 0:34:5,642
Now the interesting thing
about that, is, uh,


890
0:34:5,642 --> 0:34:7,544
I was just about
to go on that trip.


891
0:34:7,544 --> 0:34:10,38
That very trip that wound up
being that boat's last trip.


892
0:34:10,38 --> 0:34:12,149
Just two days
before we left,


893
0:34:12,149 --> 0:34:15,652
I got the opportunity for a
full-time job on a day boat.


894
0:34:15,652 --> 0:34:17,788
So I went with
the full-time job.


895
0:34:17,788 --> 0:34:20,324
Like that kid Sully, we were
down in the Crow's Nest


896
0:34:20,324 --> 0:34:23,6
having a few beers and he
loaned me some money that


897
0:34:23,6 --> 0:34:24,228
night.


898
0:34:24,228 --> 0:34:26,597
He loaned me a few hundred
bucks, and to this day,


899
0:34:26,597 --> 0:34:29,299
I still owe him that money.


900
0:34:29,299 --> 0:34:32,302
If it wasn't for me getting
that full-time day job,


901
0:34:32,302 --> 0:34:34,505
you know, I'd be with the
rest of those guys on the


902
0:34:34,505 --> 0:34:36,14
Andrea Gail.


903
0:34:36,14 --> 0:34:37,941
And I wouldn't
have any kids.


904
0:34:37,941 --> 0:34:39,176
Man: Not to mention, you
wouldn't be cutting that


905
0:34:39,176 --> 0:34:40,444
flounder right now.


906
0:34:40,444 --> 0:34:42,479
Marciano: Yeah.


907
0:34:42,479 --> 0:34:43,147
Jay: Hey, Dave?


908
0:34:43,147 --> 0:34:44,114
Marciano: Yeah?


909
0:34:44,114 --> 0:34:45,983
Jay: That boat's on
a fish over there.


910
0:34:45,983 --> 0:34:46,783
That guy.


911
0:34:46,783 --> 0:34:47,384
I just watched
him do a circle.


912
0:34:47,384 --> 0:34:52,89
Marciano: Oh, yeah?


913
0:34:52,89 --> 0:34:55,926
Kevin: Stay on him.


914
0:34:55,926 --> 0:34:57,327
Which way?


915
0:34:57,327 --> 0:34:59,163
I need one guy
talking to me.


916
0:34:59,163 --> 0:34:59,496
Scott: Good.


917
0:34:59,496 --> 0:35:0,23
Good.


918
0:35:0,23 --> 0:35:1,64
Blair: There, good.


919
0:35:1,64 --> 0:35:3,33
Scott: Ah, Jesus,
pulling hard.


920
0:35:3,33 --> 0:35:5,35
Kevin: One more circle
then I'm coming back.


921
0:35:5,35 --> 0:35:9,84
Scott: All right, that's
good, right there.


922
0:35:9,84 --> 0:35:11,975
Bill: You've got
to be (bleep) me.


923
0:35:11,975 --> 0:35:14,411
Scott: Kevin on Christina
the hug boat, he, uh,


924
0:35:14,411 --> 0:35:15,746
was here five
minutes, he hooked up,


925
0:35:15,746 --> 0:35:18,982
and he's off fighting
the fish right now.


926
0:35:18,982 --> 0:35:20,918
Bill: How can that be?


927
0:35:20,918 --> 0:35:23,32
How, how can that be?


928
0:35:23,32 --> 0:35:24,755
Donna: It be.


929
0:35:24,755 --> 0:35:27,257
Scott: I'm trying to
stay on top of this fish.


930
0:35:27,257 --> 0:35:29,92
Gonna keep the
pressure on him,


931
0:35:29,92 --> 0:35:31,361
and slowly bring him up.


932
0:35:31,361 --> 0:35:33,13
Kevin: Dad, get
the small harpoon.


933
0:35:33,13 --> 0:35:34,798
Get the small harpoon.


934
0:35:34,798 --> 0:35:35,933
I'm gonna come back.


935
0:35:35,933 --> 0:35:42,72
Tell me when I can
come back, Scott.


936
0:35:42,72 --> 0:35:43,373
Scott: Back, back, back,
back, back, back back.


937
0:35:43,373 --> 0:35:44,174
Kevin: Keep him coming,
keep him coming.


938
0:35:44,174 --> 0:35:49,313
Keep him coming.


939
0:35:49,313 --> 0:35:50,48
All right, we got him.


940
0:35:50,48 --> 0:35:51,81
Sammy: I got the gaff.


941
0:35:51,81 --> 0:35:51,548
Kevin: Gaff.


942
0:35:51,548 --> 0:35:53,817
Tail, tail wrap.


943
0:35:53,817 --> 0:35:58,88
Then we're gonna go watch
the Patriots, boys.


944
0:35:58,88 --> 0:36:0,424
All right, now
we're roped up.


945
0:36:0,424 --> 0:36:0,857
Man: I'm on it.


946
0:36:0,857 --> 0:36:5,62
Get on it.


947
0:36:5,62 --> 0:36:9,233
Kevin: Nice
angling, my friend.


948
0:36:9,233 --> 0:36:10,767
Let's go guys.


949
0:36:10,767 --> 0:36:14,104
Pull.


950
0:36:14,104 --> 0:36:16,39
Man: It's a whale!


951
0:36:16,39 --> 0:36:19,276
Kevin: Told you they
grow when they come in.


952
0:36:19,276 --> 0:36:21,645
Ooh, that's, uh, that
might be a grander.


953
0:36:21,645 --> 0:36:25,716
Man: It might be, it might
be another thousand pounder.


954
0:36:25,716 --> 0:36:28,719
Kevin: Right there,
that's what you do.


955
0:36:28,719 --> 0:36:31,488
108.


956
0:36:31,488 --> 0:36:43,7
108.


957
0:36:43,7 --> 0:36:52,142
Dave: Holy (bleep).


958
0:36:52,142 --> 0:36:52,943
Oh, there he is!


959
0:36:52,943 --> 0:36:53,777
We're on!


960
0:36:53,777 --> 0:36:54,578
We're on, we're
on, we're on!


961
0:36:54,578 --> 0:36:55,746
Paul: Yeah!


962
0:36:55,746 --> 0:36:56,68
Dave: Yeah, (bleep).


963
0:36:56,68 --> 0:36:57,14
Go!


964
0:36:57,14 --> 0:36:57,781
Go!


965
0:36:57,781 --> 0:36:58,749
This is the one.


966
0:36:58,749 --> 0:37:0,15
This is the one that's
gonna beat Kevin.


967
0:37:0,15 --> 0:37:2,152
Might be a grander.


968
0:37:2,152 --> 0:37:3,287
This is it, guys.


969
0:37:3,287 --> 0:37:4,888
Paul: This is the one
that's gonna beat Kevin.


970
0:37:4,888 --> 0:37:6,56
Dave: Come on,
Sandro, come on.


971
0:37:6,56 --> 0:37:6,957
Paul: This is it, guys.


972
0:37:6,957 --> 0:37:15,899
Dave: Whoa!


973
0:37:15,899 --> 0:37:17,534
Dave: Kevin just put
another one on the boat.


974
0:37:17,534 --> 0:37:18,302
Sandro, stay on him.


975
0:37:18,302 --> 0:37:19,403
Stay on him.


976
0:37:19,403 --> 0:37:20,47
I know there's a lot more
money swimming under the


977
0:37:20,47 --> 0:37:23,4
boat right now that
we're gonna catch.


978
0:37:23,4 --> 0:37:29,446
Paul: This might
be a grander!


979
0:37:29,446 --> 0:37:31,14
Dave: Come on,
Sandro, come on!


980
0:37:31,14 --> 0:37:34,151
This is the one!


981
0:37:34,151 --> 0:37:34,985
This might be him.


982
0:37:34,985 --> 0:37:40,357
This is it, guys.


983
0:37:40,357 --> 0:37:42,893
God damn it, another
(bleep) baby.


984
0:37:42,893 --> 0:37:45,629
Paul: Oh, there
goes this line.


985
0:37:45,629 --> 0:37:50,767
Dave: Man, I don't have
time for this today.


986
0:37:50,767 --> 0:37:53,87
Paul: Another (bleep) baby.


987
0:37:53,87 --> 0:37:54,571
Dave: Let it go.


988
0:37:54,571 --> 0:38:0,377
Let it go for another day.


989
0:38:0,377 --> 0:38:1,545
Little rats.


990
0:38:1,545 --> 0:38:2,546
Sandro: A baby.


991
0:38:2,546 --> 0:38:8,652
Dave: Ready?


992
0:38:8,652 --> 0:38:10,754
Kevin: Let him go,
it's just a baby!


993
0:38:10,754 --> 0:38:13,56
It's a baby!


994
0:38:13,56 --> 0:38:19,963
Come on, 144 inches
over here, Davy.


995
0:38:19,963 --> 0:38:21,598
Paul: Kevin, he
was being cocky.


996
0:38:21,598 --> 0:38:23,1
He's like, look at
that (bleep) thing,


997
0:38:23,1 --> 0:38:24,968
look how little it is.


998
0:38:24,968 --> 0:38:31,975
Kevin: Hundred and forty
four inches, Dave.


999
0:38:31,975 --> 0:38:34,144
Paul: I felt like (bleep)
going over there and cutting


1000
0:38:34,144 --> 0:38:38,14
his off.


1001
0:38:38,14 --> 0:38:39,483
Dave: I know I'm never gonna
hear the end of Kevin's


1002
0:38:39,483 --> 0:38:40,45
fish.


1003
0:38:40,45 --> 0:38:43,754
He'll find some way
to stick it to me.


1004
0:38:43,754 --> 0:38:45,322
Kevin: I've said it to Dave,
and I said it to him earlier


1005
0:38:45,322 --> 0:38:46,56
today.


1006
0:38:46,56 --> 0:38:47,491
I said, "Size matters, Dave.


1007
0:38:47,491 --> 0:38:48,625
And you know it."


1008
0:38:48,625 --> 0:38:51,862
There's only room for one
Number One in this group,


1009
0:38:51,862 --> 0:38:53,196
and sorry, buddy.


1010
0:38:53,196 --> 0:39:6,276
It's right here.


1011
0:39:6,276 --> 0:39:9,746
Came in early because,
uh, couple reasons.


1012
0:39:9,746 --> 0:39:12,649
Boat's full.


1013
0:39:12,649 --> 0:39:14,384
Which is a good thing.


1014
0:39:14,384 --> 0:39:16,553
We pretty much went through
all the tackle that we had,


1015
0:39:16,553 --> 0:39:18,388
and, you know, I'm
just, I'm just beat.


1016
0:39:18,388 --> 0:39:19,256
I'm beat.


1017
0:39:19,256 --> 0:39:20,791
We couldn't have
hit that one better.


1018
0:39:20,791 --> 0:39:22,225
Man: We need
those dots back.


1019
0:39:22,225 --> 0:39:23,126
Kevin: Yeah,
we're out of dots.


1020
0:39:23,126 --> 0:39:25,829
That's another
reason we came in.


1021
0:39:25,829 --> 0:39:35,338
We had no dots,
we're out of dots.


1022
0:39:35,338 --> 0:39:36,39
Man 1: Close to 800.


1023
0:39:36,39 --> 0:39:37,974
Seven and change.


1024
0:39:37,974 --> 0:39:40,177
Big fish.


1025
0:39:40,177 --> 0:39:41,745
Man 2: Here's your receipt.


1026
0:39:41,745 --> 0:39:42,446
Good job.


1027
0:39:42,446 --> 0:39:43,313
Kevin: Thanks.


1028
0:39:43,313 --> 0:39:44,948
Man 2: Good job.


1029
0:39:44,948 --> 0:39:46,45
Kevin: I'm hanging on with
the biggest fish out of the


1030
0:39:46,45 --> 0:39:48,18
group here, so.


1031
0:39:48,18 --> 0:39:50,454
Uh, I don't think, uh,
delicate Dave's gonna beat


1032
0:39:50,454 --> 0:39:52,856
it.


1033
0:39:52,856 --> 0:39:54,424
Man: See you, guys.


1034
0:39:54,424 --> 0:39:55,358
Kevin: It's been
a good week,


1035
0:39:55,358 --> 0:39:57,427
but the Pats are
playing tonight.


1036
0:39:57,427 --> 0:40:5,101
I'd like to see this game.


1037
0:40:5,101 --> 0:40:6,303
Jay: This is how
the rig's gotta be.


1038
0:40:6,303 --> 0:40:7,704
It's gotta be right on
the bottom, like that.


1039
0:40:7,704 --> 0:40:8,705
Man 1: Yeah.


1040
0:40:8,705 --> 0:40:9,372
Jay: Keep it tight.


1041
0:40:9,372 --> 0:40:10,207
Man 1: Yeah.


1042
0:40:10,207 --> 0:40:11,141
Marciano: Guys
are hooking up.


1043
0:40:11,141 --> 0:40:13,21
I can see their
bent rods from here.


1044
0:40:13,21 --> 0:40:16,313
But I got to sit here and
tell fishing stories.


1045
0:40:16,313 --> 0:40:18,14
I might shift in
a minute, guys.


1046
0:40:18,14 --> 0:40:19,95
I don't see us getting
much good here.


1047
0:40:19,95 --> 0:40:21,84
We'll give it a
few more minutes.


1048
0:40:21,84 --> 0:40:21,551
Man 2: I'm good for


1049
0:40:21,551 --> 0:40:22,886
one minute.


1050
0:40:22,886 --> 0:40:23,62
Ask my wife.


1051
0:40:23,62 --> 0:40:25,622
Ha ha ha.


1052
0:40:25,622 --> 0:40:28,492
Man 3: That is so stupid.


1053
0:40:28,492 --> 0:40:29,493
Jay: Oh, we're on,
we're on, we're on!


1054
0:40:29,493 --> 0:40:32,462
We're on!


1055
0:40:32,462 --> 0:40:38,869
Dave!


1056
0:40:38,869 --> 0:40:41,805
Jay: Um, about
a 300-pounder!


1057
0:40:41,805 --> 0:40:43,54
Man 2: Go, Dave, come on!


1058
0:40:43,54 --> 0:40:44,708
Jay: We got you, Dave!


1059
0:40:44,708 --> 0:40:48,11
Man 3: Marciano, he's
bringing him in.


1060
0:40:48,11 --> 0:40:49,312
Jay: He's coming
right at us.


1061
0:40:49,312 --> 0:40:50,38
There he is.


1062
0:40:50,38 --> 0:40:51,248
Man 3: There we go.


1063
0:40:51,248 --> 0:40:51,781
Man 2: Let's get him!


1064
0:40:51,781 --> 0:40:52,516
Man 3: Let's go!


1065
0:40:52,516 --> 0:40:53,55
Jay: I saw his tail.


1066
0:40:53,55 --> 0:40:56,386
Right there, right there!


1067
0:40:56,386 --> 0:41:0,223
My (bleep) heart's out
of my chest right now.


1068
0:41:0,223 --> 0:41:3,994
Marciano: This I think is
about a 400-pound fish.


1069
0:41:3,994 --> 0:41:6,997
So we know he's gonna be at
least five grand for me.


1070
0:41:6,997 --> 0:41:7,964
Man 2: Come on!


1071
0:41:7,964 --> 0:41:8,999
Man 3: Yeah, come
on, Dave, here we go!


1072
0:41:8,999 --> 0:41:10,734
Marciano: Watch what I'm
doing, alright guys?


1073
0:41:10,734 --> 0:41:12,469
We'll give you a
little time on the rod?


1074
0:41:12,469 --> 0:41:13,436
Man: Yep.


1075
0:41:13,436 --> 0:41:14,371
Marciano: You saw
how we did it, right?


1076
0:41:14,371 --> 0:41:17,674
You pull with one,
reel in the other.


1077
0:41:17,674 --> 0:41:19,776
You know, for me, now we're
hooked up to an eight or


1078
0:41:19,776 --> 0:41:21,878
eight or 10,000 dollar fish.


1079
0:41:21,878 --> 0:41:22,946
I did have a
little, you know,


1080
0:41:22,946 --> 0:41:25,849
anxiety letting these
guys get in on the game,


1081
0:41:25,849 --> 0:41:27,35
fight the fish for
a little while.


1082
0:41:27,35 --> 0:41:29,386
You gotta keep that
rod bent for me though.


1083
0:41:29,386 --> 0:41:30,52
Jay: Nice and easy Johnny!


1084
0:41:30,52 --> 0:41:32,389
Man: The Tuna God,
thatta boy, Johnny boy.


1085
0:41:32,389 --> 0:41:33,89
You're the man!


1086
0:41:33,89 --> 0:41:36,426
Marciano: It's not gonna be
very exciting for them if


1087
0:41:36,426 --> 0:41:38,695
Jay and I just
bring the fish in.


1088
0:41:38,695 --> 0:41:40,33
Who's gonna pay
you to do that?


1089
0:41:40,33 --> 0:41:41,965
Well if they get
a taste of this,


1090
0:41:41,965 --> 0:41:44,301
they're gonna want to
come back and do more.


1091
0:41:44,301 --> 0:41:45,669
All right, watch the tip.


1092
0:41:45,669 --> 0:41:47,737
While you guys are fighting
this fish, watch the tip.


1093
0:41:47,737 --> 0:41:48,972
That's the key.


1094
0:41:48,972 --> 0:41:50,974
The part that bothers me
a little bit about this


1095
0:41:50,974 --> 0:41:53,71
situation, you can
lose one so easily.


1096
0:41:53,71 --> 0:41:56,78
And now I gotta have six
cherries on the rod,


1097
0:41:56,78 --> 0:41:58,782
so they can all
get a little turn?


1098
0:41:58,782 --> 0:42:1,751
You know, that's the
potential for making six new


1099
0:42:1,751 --> 0:42:4,22
guy mistakes which
could cost me this


1100
0:42:4,22 --> 0:42:7,591
8,000-dollar fish?


1101
0:42:7,591 --> 0:42:9,893
Eventually, and
we got to land that fish.


1102
0:42:9,893 --> 0:42:12,162
All 800 pounds of him.


1103
0:42:12,162 --> 0:42:13,763
Broke the (bleep)
tail strap.


1104
0:42:13,763 --> 0:42:19,903
Jay: Oh, my goodness.


1105
0:42:19,903 --> 0:42:22,372
Wow.


1106
0:42:22,372 --> 0:42:24,341
It is a big (bleep) fish.


1107
0:42:24,341 --> 0:42:25,542
He's way bigger.


1108
0:42:25,542 --> 0:42:27,77
Marciano: It was a thrill
for them to see such a big,


1109
0:42:27,77 --> 0:42:30,68
beautiful fish up
close and personal.


1110
0:42:30,68 --> 0:42:34,117
Now we got him.


1111
0:42:34,117 --> 0:42:36,119
Man 3: Jesus,
feel that derma.


1112
0:42:36,119 --> 0:42:37,821
Marciano: Hard, huh?


1113
0:42:37,821 --> 0:42:38,955
Man: Say thank you.


1114
0:42:38,955 --> 0:42:40,59
Feel it, feel it.


1115
0:42:40,59 --> 0:42:41,324
Man: Whoa.


1116
0:42:41,324 --> 0:42:42,425
Oh my God.


1117
0:42:42,425 --> 0:42:55,472
Look at that
frigging football.


1118
0:42:55,472 --> 0:42:57,14
Dave: Kevin got a big
thousand pounder now and


1119
0:42:57,14 --> 0:42:59,676
we're here to catch a big
fish and it didn't happen.


1120
0:42:59,676 --> 0:43:3,213
Paul: Dave's been beside
himself that Kevin got that


1121
0:43:3,213 --> 0:43:4,8
big fish.


1122
0:43:4,8 --> 0:43:5,849
Dave: I want to
beat his (bleep).


1123
0:43:5,849 --> 0:43:6,716
That's what's
important here,


1124
0:43:6,716 --> 0:43:7,984
it's not about the
dollars anymore,


1125
0:43:7,984 --> 0:43:9,52
it's about the biggest fish.


1126
0:43:9,52 --> 0:43:9,919
Paul: I said, "Don't worry.


1127
0:43:9,919 --> 0:43:11,421
We'll get one
bigger than Kevin's.


1128
0:43:11,421 --> 0:43:12,389
You just wait."


1129
0:43:12,389 --> 0:43:13,289
Dave: We deserve
to be on top.


1130
0:43:13,289 --> 0:43:14,858
I mean, we're working
hardest at it.


1131
0:43:14,858 --> 0:43:17,16
I'm not gonna sleep until
I get a bigger fish than


1132
0:43:17,16 --> 0:43:19,62
Kevin.


1133
0:43:19,62 --> 0:43:20,3
Paul: You know what Kevin?


1134
0:43:20,3 --> 0:43:30,373
We're (bleep) coming
for you, dude.


1135
0:43:30,373 --> 0:43:32,475
Marciano: This morning, I
wasn't too thrilled about


1136
0:43:32,475 --> 0:43:33,61
this trip.


1137
0:43:33,61 --> 0:43:36,379
But I gotta admit, it was
fun to have an audience


1138
0:43:36,379 --> 0:43:38,148
cheering me on.


1139
0:43:38,148 --> 0:43:39,416
Tail's up, man.


1140
0:43:39,416 --> 0:43:41,584
That's what it's all
about right there.


1141
0:43:41,584 --> 0:43:42,886
A couple of you
kneel down in front of him


1142
0:43:42,886 --> 0:43:46,389
so we can get everybody
in, even the whole fish.


1143
0:43:46,389 --> 0:43:48,358
I love it when a
plan comes together.


1144
0:43:48,358 --> 0:43:50,727
As a rule of thumb, I don't
like people on my boat.


1145
0:43:50,727 --> 0:43:55,65
But this is a great
bunch of guys.


1146
0:43:55,65 --> 0:43:56,7
'Cause this is the
part we get paid for.


1147
0:43:56,7 --> 0:43:57,934
We don't get paid
for the head.


1148
0:43:57,934 --> 0:43:59,736
We don't get paid
for the tail.


1149
0:43:59,736 --> 0:44:3,54
We get paid for the meat.


1150
0:44:3,54 --> 0:44:5,341
Man 2: You know what
I got to tell you?


1151
0:44:5,341 --> 0:44:7,644
You made sure that each of
us got to take a little


1152
0:44:7,644 --> 0:44:8,545
turn.


1153
0:44:8,545 --> 0:44:9,279
Marciano: Yeah?


1154
0:44:9,279 --> 0:44:10,213
Man 2: Reeling that fish in.


1155
0:44:10,213 --> 0:44:11,381
I know it was a lot
of money for you.


1156
0:44:11,381 --> 0:44:12,982
And, we, you know, we're all
rookies, and everything.


1157
0:44:12,982 --> 0:44:14,184
Marciano: Right.


1158
0:44:14,184 --> 0:44:15,552
Man 2: But the fact that you
thought of enough to make


1159
0:44:15,552 --> 0:44:18,221
sure we all it
meant a lot to us.


1160
0:44:18,221 --> 0:44:18,855
Marciano: Good, good.


1161
0:44:18,855 --> 0:44:19,689
I'm glad you enjoyed it.


1162
0:44:19,689 --> 0:44:20,59
That's what it's all about.


1163
0:44:20,59 --> 0:44:21,658
Man 2: Thank you very much.


1164
0:44:21,658 --> 0:44:22,659
Man 4: Best Captain on
the planet, right there.


1165
0:44:22,659 --> 0:44:23,693
Man 1: Right there,
buddy, right there.


1166
0:44:23,693 --> 0:44:25,261
Man 4: Captain
Dave Marciano.


1167
0:44:25,261 --> 0:44:26,596
The best.


1168
0:44:26,596 --> 0:44:27,564
Not just because I'm
married to your sister.


1169
0:44:27,564 --> 0:44:28,965
Jay: What, what
about the best crew?


1170
0:44:28,965 --> 0:44:30,266
Nothing about the crew?


1171
0:44:30,266 --> 0:44:31,801
Nothing about the crew?


1172
0:44:31,801 --> 0:44:33,636
Man: Who's he?


1173
0:44:33,636 --> 0:44:34,804
Jay: Who's this guy?


1174
0:44:34,804 --> 0:44:35,605
Man 2: I thought
he worked here.


1175
0:44:35,605 --> 0:44:38,475
Thank you, fellas.


1176
0:44:38,475 --> 0:46:38,475
Great trip.
