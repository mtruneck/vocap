###26 BEEFY: Mate, I'm starving.
###29 NATHAN: Tell me about it.
###30 What have you got?
###31 BEEFY: Burger.
###32 NATHAN: Oh, man.
###33 Ha.
###34 BEEFY: What?
###35 NATHAN: Hey.
###36 BEEFY: What are you mean about?
###37 NATHAN: OK.
###38 Right.
###38 You ain't going to believe this, because I didn't believe
###40 it at first.
###41 But I swear it's true, 'cause Ash said he
###42 heard the same thing.
###43 BEEFY: What are you talking to Ash for, man?
###45 NATHAN: Look, you know that kid who got
###45 stabbed last month?
###47 
###49 BEEFY: Yeah.
###50 I heard about it.
###50 But I didn't know him.
###51 NATHAN: Yeah, but you heard about it, right?
###53 BEEFY: Yeah.
###54 NATHAN: Well, anyway, after he got stabbed, the guys who
###56 stabbed him let him get away.
###58 Too busy arguing like idiots.
###59 
###63 So the stabbed kid, you know, he's trying to get away, but
###65 there's no where for him to go.
###67 So he's stumbling down that alleyway.
###68 You know, one arm pushed against his wound like that.
###70 And as he looks behind him, they're all there,
###72 coming after him.
###73 
###76 So he turns a corner, and he sees the bright
###78 lights of this place.
###79 
###83 
###86 He stumbles in.
###87 He's fallen behind the counter.
###89 But now, he's leaking like a tap.
###90 Blood everywhere.
###92 
###98 BEEFY: No way.
###98 This place?
###99 NATHAN: Yeah.
###99 This place.
###100 I mean, the kebab guy, he didn't know what was going on.
###102 He didn't know whether to help him or chuck him out.
###103 
###107 [CLINK]
###108 BEEFY: Yeah.
###108 And?
###109 NATHAN: Right.
###110 So now, the gang bursts through the doors, and they're
###112 looking to finish him off.
###113 -What the fuck are you looking at, man?
###115 Move.
###115 BEEFY: Wait.
###116 This really happened here?
###117 NATHAN: Yeah.
###117 It gets worse.
###117 Look, I'm telling you.
###119 They started giving it real big to the kebab guy.
###121 You know, telling him to get out of the way so they could
###122 get to the kid.
###123 -Move.
###124 -Get out of the fucking way, man.
###125 Are you mad?
###127 NATHAN: What do you think the owner's done?
###129 BEEFY: I don't know.
###130 NATHAN: Well, they didn't take too kindly to it, you see.
###132 Some fuckers running in there with knives
###133 out looking for trouble.
###135 They've had enough of that shit.
###136 They're probably from some war-torn country, you know?
###138 Seeing shit me and you wouldn't believe.
###140 So he picks up a knife.
###143 I ain't talking about no pocket knife.
###145 I'm talking about a big, motherfucking knife.
###147 BEEFY: Shit man.
###148 That's some "Crocodile Dundee" shit.
###150 NATHAN: Exactly.
###151 And the other two workers, they got two knives.
###153 And it's three on three.
###157 
###188 BEEFY: What the hell happens?
###189 NATHAN: What happens?
###190 Oh, come on.
###192 Use your imagination.
###193 
###197 Why do think I'm only eating the chips?
###198 
###203 [LAUGHING]
###205 BEEFY: [INAUDIBLE], man.
###206 Is it true?
###207 Is it true?
###207 NATHAN: Yeah.
###207 BEEFY: What?
###208 NATHAN: No, I'm joking.
###210 You should have seen your face.
###211 Oh, I should have held it for longer.
###213 Eat up.
