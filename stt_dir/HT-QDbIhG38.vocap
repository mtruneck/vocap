###1 CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: There are loud cars, there are quiet cars. People are saying, some
###5 cars are too quiet, and now the governments getting involved. I`m Carl Azuz. We are hitting
###9 the gas on the new edition of CNN STUDENT NEWS.
###14 Newtown, Connecticut, Aurora, Colorado, Tucson, Arizona - when a mass shooting happens like
###31 we`ve seen in those cities, the issue of gun control often comes up. President Obama has
###36 said he wants to take action on this, he`s put Vice President Joe Biden in charge of
###40 coming up with ideas on how to reduce gun violence. Vice President Biden`s task force
###46 is getting input from people with many different view points. Yesterday, I`ve met with gun
###50 safety organizations and victims from some of these shootings. Now, they are pushing
###55 for stricter gun control. Today, the task force is set to meet with representatives
###60 from groups that support gun rights, like the National Rifle Association. That organization
###65 says it`s committed to protecting people, but it thinks stricter gun laws aren`t the
###69 best way to do that. Retail stores that sell guns are also going to be involved in these
###74 meetings. President Obama said he wants some concrete proposals from the task force by
###79 the end of this month.
###81 2012 is in the books, and it`s in the record books, too. Last year is officially the hottest
###87 year ever for the United States. It was also the second worst for extreme weather: things
###92 like hurricanes, droughts or floods. The average temperature across the lower 48 states was
###98 55.3 degrees. That beat the old record by a full degree. Scientists say that when things
###104 get warmer, it raises the chances for extreme weather. All 48 of those states had above
###110 average temperatures last year, but some set their own superlatives.

###113 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You`ve got to tell me if you don`t feel good.
###115 CHAD MYERS, AMS METEOROLOGIST: The warmest year on record for the United States. Every
###119 here, every spot here in the red, a new record for the hottest event for any year ever recorded.
###125 And July, 2012 was the hottest year on record of any month we`ve ever recorded since we`ve
###132 been here.

###133 AZUZ: In many U.S. States state legislatures are back in session this week and next. They`ve
###137 got different names in different states. They may be called the state house and senate.
###141 The legislative assembly, the general assembly, but basically, they are meeting of people
###146 elected by the states citizens to make laws.
###149 All right, cool, so what - well, a lot of the things that affect you every day are determined
###154 by state legislatures. They make laws about your schools and the requirements for graduation.
###159 They decide who can drive and when, they ensure roads are taken care of and safe. They operate
###165 states courts and they decide how much tax you pay when you go out to eat or you buy
###170 clothes. These are all responsibilities of the state, so while we spend a lot of time
###174 talking about the U.S. Congress on CNN STUDENT NEWS, we want you to keep in mind that your
###179 state law makers pass laws that effect you as well. It`s part of what`s called "federalism."
###183 It`s a system of government where the same place is controlled by two different authorities,
###189 so in this case that would be your state government and the U.S. Federal Government. Each of the
###194 50 states has a governor he or she represents the states executive branch. Your state courts
###198 are the states judicial branch and the state legislatures we just talked about make up
###203 your states legislative branch.

###207 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: See if you can I.D. me. I`m a South American country that`s home to
###213 about 28 million people. I border the Caribbean Sea, Colombia and Brazil. I`m one of the world`s
###220 largest exporters of oil. My president is Hugo Chavez. I`m Venezuela. And President
###231 Chavez has been in charge of my government for nearly 14 years.
###235 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###237 AZUZ: Hugo Chavez is supposed to stay in charge of Venezuela`s government for the next six
###242 years. He was reelected to a new term last year. The country`s constitution says his
###246 inauguration is today, on January Tenth. There`s a problem, though, Chavez won`t be there.
###253 The Venezuelan president has been in Cuba for the past month or so, he`s being treated
###257 there for cancer. There was some concern in Venezuela about what might happen if Chavez
###262 missed the inauguration. The Constitution there says that if a leader is permanently
###266 absent, there would have to be new elections. That`s not going to happen. Yesterday Venezuela`s
###271 Supreme Court ruled that President Chavez will start his new term today even if he`s
###277 not sworn in.

###284 School inn Palm Bay, Florida.
###287 What U.S. State is home to the National Baseball Hall of Fame? You know what to do, is it in
###292 New York, Ohio, Texas or California? You`ve got three seconds, go!
###302 Baseball`s Hall of Fame is in Cooperstown. So if you said New York, you hit out the park.
###310 That`s your answer and that`s your shoutout.
###314 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###316 AZUZ: That Hall of Fame isn`t getting any new members this year: there were 37 players
###321 eligible to get into Cooperstown on the 2013 ballot. But when the votes came in, no one
###327 was elected to the Hall of Fame. This isn`t that unusual, it has happened before seven
###332 other times since the Hall of Fame voting started in 1936. What`s really interesting
###337 about this, this time around is that some of the players who were eligible for the first
###341 time have been accused of using performance enhancing drugs. That includes all time home
###346 run king Barry Bonds, seven times Cy Young winner Roger Clemens and Sammy Sosa, one of
###352 only eight players to hit more than 600 career home runs. All three have denied using performance
###358 enhancing drugs. The Hall of Fame is voted on by members of the Baseball Writers` Association
###363 of America. Players need to get support from 75 percent of the voters in order to get into
###368 Cooperstown. One voter said, this year`s results are a statement on baseball`s so called "steroid
###374 era." He says the concerns about players who were linked to steroids has hurt the Hall
###379 of Fame chances for some clean players as well. This is an issue we are talking about
###383 in our blog. So, you are welcome to log on to cnnstudent.com, to tell us your opinion.
###389 In 2010, Congress passed a law called the Pedestrian Safety Enhancement Act, it laid
###394 out new rules for certain vehicles. The Department of Transportation looked at a lot of factors
###398 including the extra costs for car companies, now they are planning to put these rules in
###403 effect. So why is the government making noise about cars that don`t make enough?
###408 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
###409 RENE MARSH, CNN CORRESPONDENT: They are green, fuel efficient, but too quiet and a potential
###414 threat to cyclists and pedestrians. That`s what the Department of Transportation says
###419 about hybrid and electric cars. The federal agency just proposed rules that would require
###425 new green vehicles make sounds loud enough to alert pedestrians and cyclists like George
###431 Abbot.
###432 GEORGE ABBOT, PEDESTRIAN, CYCLIST: I have the experience going alongside them - and
###434 not, like not realizing that there was one there.
###437 MARSH: It`s what`s under the hood that makes this hybrid an electric car so quiet on the
###442 road. This Nissan Leaf also has technologies similar to what the government wants in all
###447 electric and hybrid cars. Do you hear that sound? Well, the government believes it could
###453 save lives.
###455 Eddie George sells the vehicles at Dart cars in Maryland.
###459 EDDIR GEORGE, DARCARS NISSAN: The car is very quiet, you cannot hear anything, so I mean
###463 you have some people when they are coming to test drive the car, the car is on.
###467 MARSH: But a flip of a switch and its pedestrian alert feature turns on. Without the feature,
###472 a much quieter drive.
###474 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I didn`t know that would help, but I think, you know, again, I think
###480 people would just need to pay more attention.
###481 MARSH: DOT says the sounds would need to be loud enough to still be heard despite other
###486 street and ambient noises when the vehicle is traveling under 18 miles per hour.
###492 The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates their proposal would mean 2800 fewer
###499 pedestrian and cyclist injuries per year.
###502 MARSH: You shouldn`t expect to hear blaring sounds coming from these green cars, if this
###507 is enacted, it was a lot louder in our piece because our mikes picked up the sound. Each
###512 company can pick their particular sound they want their cars to make. For example, the
###517 vehicle we looked at, the Nissan Leaf, the technology, it was developed with the help
###522 of students at some of the country`s schools for the hearing impaired. Rene Marsh, CNN,
###527 Washington.

###528 AZUZ: All right, well, before we go, we`ve got a beastly tail of mistaken identity: reports
###534 of a lion on the loose in Norfolk, Virginia, might have given some residents paws - look
###540 at this thing, it`s kind of cute. There was no need for concern, as you can see. The carousing
###544 cat was actually a dog. Easy to understand the mix up, though. This labradoodle`s owner
###550 cuts his canine so that he resembles the local university mascot - a lion. Still, police
###555 called the zoo just to make sure that cats were in their cages. So it seems like this
###560 time the main event was just the king of the concrete jungle. CNN STUDENT NEWS returns
###565 tomorrow. No lion about that, we look forward to seeing you all then.
