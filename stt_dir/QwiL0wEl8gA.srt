In a decaying society, Art


2
0:0:8,8 --> 0:0:13,76
if it is truthful, must also reflect decay.


3
0:0:13,76 --> 0:0:19,64
And unless it wants to break faith with its social function


4
0:0:19,64 --> 0:0:24,92
Art must show the world as changeable.


5
0:0:24,92 --> 0:0:28,56
And help to change it.

Deadly riots over the government's


8
0:0:34,4 --> 0:0:36,64
plan to avoid defaulting on its loans...


9
0:0:36,64 --> 0:0:38,72
is that the unemployment keeps


10
0:0:38,72 --> 0:0:40,84
rising and it has to keep rising


11
0:0:40,84 --> 0:0:44,56
just because we have an excess supply of goods...


12
0:0:44,56 --> 0:0:46,8
this is all borrowed money...


13
0:0:46,8 --> 0:0:50,72
and that debt is owned by banks in other countries...


14
0:0:50,72 --> 0:0:55,28

Now, my grandmother was a wonderful person.


20
0:1:10,32 --> 0:1:13,72
She taught me how to play the game Monopoly.


21
0:1:13,72 --> 0:1:17,56
She understood that the name of the game is to acquire.


22
0:1:17,56 --> 0:1:19,4
She would accumulate everything she could and


23
0:1:19,4 --> 0:1:23,2
eventually, she became the master of the board.


24
0:1:23,2 --> 0:1:24,96
And then she would always say the same thing to me.


25
0:1:24,96 --> 0:1:27,4
She would look at me and she would say:


26
0:1:27,4 --> 0:1:30,96
“One day, you'll learn to play the game.”


27
0:1:30,96 --> 0:1:34,32
One summer I played Monopoly almost every day, all day long


28
0:1:34,32 --> 0:1:37,4
and that summer, I learned to play the game.


29
0:1:37,4 --> 0:1:39,76
I came to understand that the only way to win


30
0:1:39,76 --> 0:1:42,68
is to make a total commitment to acquisition.


31
0:1:42,68 --> 0:1:44,96
I came to understand that money and possessions...


32
0:1:44,96 --> 0:1:48,4
that's the way that you keep score.


33
0:1:48,4 --> 0:1:49,36
And by the end of that summer


34
0:1:49,36 --> 0:1:51,64
I was more ruthless than my grandmother.


35
0:1:51,64 --> 0:1:55,88
I was ready to bend the rules if I had to, to win that game...


36
0:1:55,88 --> 0:1:59,2
and I sat down with her to play that fall.


37
0:1:59,2 --> 0:2:1,52
I took everything she had. I watched her


38
0:2:1,52 --> 0:2:6,4
give her last dollar and quit in utter defeat.


39
0:2:6,4 --> 0:2:10,8
And then she had one more thing to teach me.


40
0:2:10,8 --> 0:2:14,44
Then she said:


41
0:2:14,44 --> 0:2:20,16
“Now it all goes back in the box.


42
0:2:20,16 --> 0:2:23,24
All those houses and hotels.


43
0:2:23,24 --> 0:2:25,6
All the railroads and utility companies...


44
0:2:25,6 --> 0:2:30,32
All that property and all that wonderful money...


45
0:2:30,32 --> 0:2:34,84
Now it all goes back in the box.


46
0:2:34,84 --> 0:2:38,24
None of it was really yours.


47
0:2:38,24 --> 0:2:41,56
You got all heated up about it for a while.


48
0:2:41,56 --> 0:2:45,64
But it was around a long time before you sat down at the board


49
0:2:45,64 --> 0:2:52,2
and it will be here after you're gone - players come - players go.


50
0:2:52,2 --> 0:2:55,16

51
0:2:55,16 --> 0:2:57,16
Titles and clothes...


52
0:2:57,16 --> 0:3:0,2
Even your body.”


53
0:3:0,2 --> 0:3:4,8
Because the fact is that everything I clutch and consume and hoard


54
0:3:4,8 --> 0:3:7,84
is going to go back in the box and I'm going to lose it all.


55
0:3:7,84 --> 0:3:9,8
So you have to ask yourself


56
0:3:9,8 --> 0:3:11,8
when you finally get the ultimate promotion


57
0:3:11,8 --> 0:3:13,64
when you have made the ultimate purchase


58
0:3:13,64 --> 0:3:15,16
when you buy the ultimate home


59
0:3:15,16 --> 0:3:17,48
when you have stored up financial security


60
0:3:17,48 --> 0:3:19,6
and climbed the ladder of success to the


61
0:3:19,6 --> 0:3:23,0
highest rung you can possibly climb it...


62
0:3:23,0 --> 0:3:25,6
and the thrill wears off


63
0:3:25,6 --> 0:3:29,8
- and it will wear off -


64
0:3:29,8 --> 0:3:32,36
Then what?


65
0:3:32,36 --> 0:3:34,52
How far do you have to walk down that road


66
0:3:34,52 --> 0:3:39,72
before you see where it leads?


67
0:3:39,72 --> 0:3:42,16
Surely you understand


68
0:3:42,16 --> 0:3:45,6
it will never be enough.


69
0:3:45,6 --> 0:3:48,92
So you have to ask yourself the question:


70
0:3:48,92 --> 0:4:49,16
What matters?


71
0:4:49,16 --> 0:4:52,24

77

When I was a young man


78
0:5:57,8 --> 0:6:0,32
growing up in New York City


79
0:6:0,32 --> 0:6:5,8
I refused to pledge allegiance to the flag.


80
0:6:5,8 --> 0:6:8,0
Of course I was sent to the principal's office.


81
0:6:8,0 --> 0:6:11,44
And he asked me 'Why don't you want to Pledge Allegiance?


82
0:6:11,44 --> 0:6:13,8
Everybody does!'


83
0:6:13,8 --> 0:6:16,0
I said, 'Everybody once believed the earth was flat


84
0:6:16,0 --> 0:6:18,2
but that doesn't make it so.'


85
0:6:18,2 --> 0:6:21,64
I explained that America owed everything it has


86
0:6:21,64 --> 0:6:23,24
to other cultures


87
0:6:23,24 --> 0:6:24,56
and other nations


88
0:6:24,56 --> 0:6:26,84
and that I would rather pledge allegiance


89
0:6:26,84 --> 0:6:27,96
to the earth


90
0:6:27,96 --> 0:6:30,84
and everyone on it.


91
0:6:30,84 --> 0:6:32,72
Needless to say, it wasn't long


92
0:6:32,72 --> 0:6:35,6
before I left school entirely


93
0:6:35,6 --> 0:6:38,76
and I set up a lab in my bedroom.


94
0:6:38,76 --> 0:6:41,32
There I began to learn about science


95
0:6:41,32 --> 0:6:42,52
and nature.


96
0:6:42,52 --> 0:6:44,4
I realized then


97
0:6:44,4 --> 0:6:46,4
that the universe is governed by laws


98
0:6:46,4 --> 0:6:48,0
and that the human being


99
0:6:48,0 --> 0:6:49,92
along with society itself


100
0:6:49,92 --> 0:6:53,84
was not exempt from these laws.


101
0:6:53,84 --> 0:6:56,84
Then came the crash of 1929.


102
0:6:56,84 --> 0:6:59,12
Which began what we now call


103
0:6:59,12 --> 0:7:0,68
“The Great Depression”.


104
0:7:0,68 --> 0:7:4,16
I found it difficult to understand why millions


105
0:7:4,16 --> 0:7:7,28
were out of work, homeless, starving


106
0:7:7,28 --> 0:7:10,36
while all the factories were sitting there.


107
0:7:10,36 --> 0:7:12,96
The resources were unchanged.


108
0:7:12,96 --> 0:7:15,0
It was then that I realized


109
0:7:15,0 --> 0:7:18,4
that the rules of the economic game


110
0:7:18,4 --> 0:7:21,16
were inherently invalid.


111
0:7:21,16 --> 0:7:24,0
Shortly after came World War II


112
0:7:24,0 --> 0:7:26,68
where various nations took turns


113
0:7:26,68 --> 0:7:29,6
systematically destroying each other.


114
0:7:29,6 --> 0:7:32,76
I later calculated that all the destruction


115
0:7:32,76 --> 0:7:34,56
and wasted resources


116
0:7:34,56 --> 0:7:36,12
spent on that war


117
0:7:36,12 --> 0:7:38,44
could have easily provided for every


118
0:7:38,44 --> 0:7:43,32
human need on the planet.


119
0:7:43,32 --> 0:7:46,48
Since that time I have watched humanity


120
0:7:46,48 --> 0:7:50,4
set the stage for its own extinction.


121
0:7:50,4 --> 0:7:53,44
I have watched as the precious finite resources


122
0:7:53,44 --> 0:7:56,24
are perpetually wasted and destroyed


123
0:7:56,24 --> 0:7:59,52
in the name of profit and free-markets.


124
0:7:59,52 --> 0:8:3,8
I have watched the social values of society be reduced


125
0:8:3,8 --> 0:8:6,96
into a base artificiality of materialism


126
0:8:6,96 --> 0:8:9,72
and mindless consumption.


127
0:8:9,72 --> 0:8:13,2
And I have watched as the monetary powers


128
0:8:13,2 --> 0:8:15,52
control the political structure


129
0:8:15,52 --> 0:8:19,56
of supposedly free societies.

0:8:19,56 --> 0:8:22,8
I'm 94 years old now.


131
0:8:22,8 --> 0:8:24,36
And I'm afraid my disposition


132
0:8:24,36 --> 0:8:26,2
is the same as it was


133
0:8:26,2 --> 0:8:30,56

0:9:15,8 --> 0:9:19,8
and somewhere along the way, hammered into your head


144
0:9:19,8 --> 0:9:22,6
is the inevitable “nature versus nurture”


145
0:9:22,6 --> 0:9:25,24

know modern biology, but for most people

out there, what it winds-up meaning is:

0:10:51,84 --> 0:10:54,2
a deterministic view of life;

196
0:11:42,72 --> 0:11:46,0
that are truly genetically determined.

0:11:46,0 --> 0:11:48,12
Most complex conditions


198
0:11:48,12 --> 0:11:52,4
might have a predisposition that has a genetic component


199
0:11:52,4 --> 0:11:56,4
but a predisposition is not the same as a predetermination.

affect gene expression


219
0:13:1,68 --> 0:13:4,48
actually turning on or off different genes


220
0:13:4,48 --> 0:13:8,24
to put you on a different developmental track


221
0:13:8,24 --> 0:13:12,24
which may suit the kind of world you've got to deal with.


222
0:13:12,24 --> 0:13:13,56
So for example.


223
0:13:13,56 --> 0:13:18,4
A study done in Montreal with suicide victims


224
0:13:18,4 --> 0:13:21,56
looked at autopsies of the brains of these people


225
0:13:21,56 --> 0:13:24,36
and it turned out that if a suicide victim


226
0:13:24,36 --> 0:13:26,28
(these are usually young adults)


227
0:13:26,28 --> 0:13:29,56
had been abused as a child, the abuse actually


228
0:13:29,56 --> 0:13:32,8
caused a genetic change in the brain


229
0:13:32,8 --> 0:13:37,8
that was absent in the brains of people who had not been abused.


230
0:13:37,8 --> 0:13:38,84
That's an epigenetic effect.


231
0:13:38,84 --> 0:13:41,76
“epi” means on top of, so that


232
0:13:41,76 --> 0:13:45,28
the epigenetic influence is what happens


233
0:13:45,28 --> 0:13:51,44
environmentally to either activate or deactivate certain genes.


234
0:13:51,44 --> 0:13:53,64
In New Zealand, there was a study


235
0:13:53,64 --> 0:13:56,36
that was done in a town called Dunedin


236
0:13:56,36 --> 0:14:0,72
in which a few thousand individuals


237
0:14:0,72 --> 0:14:5,52
were studied from birth into their 20s.


238
0:14:5,52 --> 0:14:11,8
What they found was that they could identify


239
0:14:11,8 --> 0:14:14,56
a genetic mutation, an abnormal gene


240
0:14:14,56 --> 0:14:17,56
which did have some relation to


241
0:14:17,56 --> 0:14:21,12
the predisposition to commit violence


242
0:14:21,12 --> 0:14:24,92
but only if the individual had also


243
0:14:24,92 --> 0:14:28,8
been subjected to severe child abuse.


244
0:14:28,8 --> 0:14:31,6
In other words, children with this abnormal gene would


245
0:14:31,6 --> 0:14:34,36
be no more likely to be violent than anybody else


246
0:14:34,36 --> 0:14:37,44
and, in fact, they actually had a lower rate of violence


247
0:14:37,44 --> 0:14:39,36
than people with normal genes


248
0:14:39,36 --> 0:14:43,2
as long as they weren't abused as children.


249
0:14:43,2 --> 0:14:45,12
Great additional example of the ways


250
0:14:45,12 --> 0:14:47,2
in which genes are not “be all - end all”.


251
0:14:47,2 --> 0:14:49,52
A fancy technique where you can


252
0:14:49,52 --> 0:14:52,8
take a specific gene out of a mouse


253
0:14:52,8 --> 0:14:54,8
and that mouse and its descendants will not have that gene.


254
0:14:54,8 --> 0:14:56,48
You have ”knocked out” that gene.


255
0:14:56,48 --> 0:14:58,2
So there's this one gene that encodes


256
0:14:58,2 --> 0:14:59,92
for a protein that has something to do


257
0:14:59,92 --> 0:15:4,12
with learning and memory and with this fabulous demonstration-


258
0:15:4,12 --> 0:15:5,68
you “knock out” that gene and you


259
0:15:5,68 --> 0:15:7,52
have a mouse that doesn't learn as well.


260
0:15:7,52 --> 0:15:10,44
“Oh! A genetic basis for intelligence!”


261
0:15:10,44 --> 0:15:13,72
What was much less appreciated in that landmark study


262
0:15:13,72 --> 0:15:16,24
that got picked up by the media left and right


263
0:15:16,24 --> 0:15:19,52
is take those genetically impaired mice


264
0:15:19,52 --> 0:15:21,6
and raise them in a much more enriched


265
0:15:21,6 --> 0:15:24,76
stimulating environment than your normal mice in a lab cage


266
0:15:24,76 --> 0:15:27,88
and they completely overcame that deficit.


267
0:15:27,88 --> 0:15:32,2
So, when one says in a contemporary sense that


268
0:15:32,2 --> 0:15:35,24
“oh, this behavior is genetic”


269
0:15:35,24 --> 0:15:38,52
to the extent that that's even a valid sort of phrase to use


270
0:15:38,52 --> 0:15:41,32
what you're saying is: there is a


271
0:15:41,32 --> 0:15:43,64
genetic contribution to how this


272
0:15:43,64 --> 0:15:45,92
organism responds to environment;


273
0:15:45,92 --> 0:15:48,6
genes may influence the


274
0:15:48,6 --> 0:15:50,84
readiness with which an organism will


275
0:15:50,84 --> 0:15:53,4
deal with a certain environmental challenge.


276
0:15:53,4 --> 0:15:56,68
You know, that's not the version most people have in their minds


277
0:15:56,68 --> 0:15:59,64
and not to be too 'soap-boxing'


278
0:15:59,64 --> 0:16:2,16
but run with the old


279
0:16:2,16 --> 0:16:4,2
version of “It's genetic!”


280
0:16:4,2 --> 0:16:7,32
and it's not that far from the history of eugenics


281
0:16:7,32 --> 0:16:9,28
and things of that sort.


282
0:16:9,28 --> 0:16:11,4
It's a widespread misconception


283
0:16:11,4 --> 0:16:14,36
and it's a potentially fairly dangerous one.


284
0:16:14,36 --> 0:16:17,48
One reason that the


285
0:16:17,48 --> 0:16:20,8
biological explanation for violence...


286
0:16:20,8 --> 0:16:23,12
one reason that hypothesis is


287
0:16:23,12 --> 0:16:25,68
potentially dangerous, it's not just misleading


288
0:16:25,68 --> 0:16:28,0
it can really do harm...


289
0:16:28,0 --> 0:16:31,16
is because if you believe that


290
0:16:31,16 --> 0:16:33,48
you could very easily say:


291
0:16:33,48 --> 0:16:35,16
“Well, there's nothing we can do


292
0:16:35,16 --> 0:16:37,28
to change the predisposition


293
0:16:37,28 --> 0:16:39,64
people have to becoming violent;


294
0:16:39,64 --> 0:16:44,32
all we can do is punish them - lock them up


295
0:16:44,32 --> 0:16:45,8
or execute them


296
0:16:45,8 --> 0:16:48,64
but we don't need to worry about changing the


297
0:16:48,64 --> 0:16:52,84
social environment or the social preconditions


298
0:16:52,84 --> 0:16:56,48
that may lead people to become violent because


299
0:16:56,48 --> 0:16:58,36
that's irrelevant'.”


300
0:16:58,36 --> 0:17:2,8
The genetic argument allows us the luxury of ignoring


301
0:17:2,8 --> 0:17:5,84
past and present historical and social factors


302
0:17:5,84 --> 0:17:8,4
and in the words of Louis Menand


303
0:17:8,4 --> 0:17:10,8
who wrote in the New Yorker


304
0:17:10,8 --> 0:17:11,52
Very astutely, he said:


305
0:17:11,52 --> 0:17:15,52
“it's all in the genes... an explanation for the way things are


306
0:17:15,52 --> 0:17:18,12
that does not threaten the way things are.


307
0:17:18,12 --> 0:17:20,56
Why should someone feel unhappy


308
0:17:20,56 --> 0:17:23,48
or engage in antisocial behavior


309
0:17:23,48 --> 0:17:25,36
when that person is living in the


310
0:17:25,36 --> 0:17:28,72
freest and most prosperous nation on Earth?


311
0:17:28,72 --> 0:17:30,56
It can't be the system.


312
0:17:30,56 --> 0:17:33,84
There must be a flaw in the wiring somewhere.”


313
0:17:33,84 --> 0:17:35,6
Which is a good way of putting it.


314
0:17:35,6 --> 0:17:39,8
So, the genetic argument is simply a cop-out


315
0:17:39,8 --> 0:17:41,32
which allows us to ignore


316
0:17:41,32 --> 0:17:44,84
the social and economic and political factors


317
0:17:44,84 --> 0:17:47,92
that, in fact, underlie


318
0:17:47,92 --> 0:17:53,12
many troublesome behaviors.


319
0:17:53,12 --> 0:17:55,68
[Case Study: Addiction]


320
0:17:55,68 --> 0:17:57,8
Addictions are usually


321
0:17:57,8 --> 0:17:59,92
considered to be a drug-related issue


322
0:17:59,92 --> 0:18:1,96
but looking at it more broadly


323
0:18:1,96 --> 0:18:4,8
I define addiction as any behavior


324
0:18:4,8 --> 0:18:7,2
that is associated with craving


325
0:18:7,2 --> 0:18:9,8
with temporary relief


326
0:18:9,8 --> 0:18:11,68
and with long-term negative consequences


327
0:18:11,68 --> 0:18:15,0
along with an impairment of control over it so that the person


328
0:18:15,0 --> 0:18:18,44
wishes to give it up or promises to do so


329
0:18:18,44 --> 0:18:20,56
but can't follow through


330
0:18:20,56 --> 0:18:23,24
and when you understand that, you see that


331
0:18:23,24 --> 0:18:24,4
there are many more addictions


332
0:18:24,4 --> 0:18:26,8
than simply those related to drugs.


333
0:18:26,8 --> 0:18:28,64
There's workaholism; addiction to shopping;


334
0:18:28,64 --> 0:18:30,76
to the Internet; to video games...


335
0:18:30,76 --> 0:18:33,4
There's the addiction to power. People that have power but they


336
0:18:33,4 --> 0:18:36,8
want more and more; nothing is ever enough for them.


337
0:18:36,8 --> 0:18:40,44
Acquisition - corporations that must own more and more.


338
0:18:40,44 --> 0:18:42,4
The addiction to oil


339
0:18:42,4 --> 0:18:44,68
or at least to the wealth and to the products made


340
0:18:44,68 --> 0:18:47,2
accessible to us by oil.


341
0:18:47,2 --> 0:18:50,4
Look at the negative consequences on the environment.


342
0:18:50,4 --> 0:18:52,6
We are destroying the very earth that we


343
0:18:52,6 --> 0:18:55,32
inhabit for the sake of that addiction.


344
0:18:55,32 --> 0:18:57,4
Now, these addictions are far more


345
0:18:57,4 --> 0:18:59,16
devastating in their social consequences


346
0:18:59,16 --> 0:19:4,32
than the cocaine or heroin habits of my downtown Eastside patients.


347
0:19:4,32 --> 0:19:8,2
Yet, they are rewarded and considered to be respectable.


348
0:19:8,2 --> 0:19:11,44
The tobacco company executive that shows a higher profit


349
0:19:11,44 --> 0:19:14,56
will get a much bigger reward.


350
0:19:14,56 --> 0:19:19,8
He doesn't face any negative consequences legally or otherwise.


351
0:19:19,8 --> 0:19:21,6
In fact he is a respected member of


352
0:19:21,6 --> 0:19:24,44
the board of several other corporations.


353
0:19:24,44 --> 0:19:27,4
But, tobacco smoke related diseases


354
0:19:27,4 --> 0:19:31,12
kill 5 ½ million people around the world every year.


355
0:19:31,12 --> 0:19:35,72
In the United States they kill 400,000 people a year.


356
0:19:35,72 --> 0:19:37,8
And these people are addicted to what? To profit.


357
0:19:37,8 --> 0:19:39,84
To such a degree that they are addicted


358
0:19:39,84 --> 0:19:42,0
that they are actually in denial


359
0:19:42,0 --> 0:19:44,48
about the impact of their activities


360
0:19:44,48 --> 0:19:47,56
which is typical for addicts, this denial.


361
0:19:47,56 --> 0:19:50,8
And that's a respectable one. It's respectable


362
0:19:50,8 --> 0:19:52,72
to be addicted to profit, no matter what the cost.


363
0:19:52,72 --> 0:19:56,12
So, what is acceptable and what is respectable


364
0:19:56,12 --> 0:19:59,28
is a highly arbitrary phenomenon in our society


365
0:19:59,28 --> 0:20:0,76
and it seems like the greater the harm


366
0:20:0,76 --> 0:20:5,84
the more respectable the addiction.


367
0:20:5,84 --> 0:20:7,96
[The Myth]


368
0:20:7,96 --> 0:20:10,76
There is a general myth that drugs, in themselves, are addictive.


369
0:20:10,76 --> 0:20:13,52
In fact, the war on drugs is predicated on the


370
0:20:13,52 --> 0:20:15,84
idea that if you interdict the source of


371
0:20:15,84 --> 0:20:18,32
drugs you can deal with addiction that way.


372
0:20:18,32 --> 0:20:21,72
Now, if you understand addiction in the broader sense


373
0:20:21,72 --> 0:20:24,24
we see that nothing in itself is addictive.


374
0:20:24,24 --> 0:20:27,48
No substance, no drug is by itself addictive


375
0:20:27,48 --> 0:20:29,48
and no behavior is by itself addictive.


376
0:20:29,48 --> 0:20:32,48
Many people can go shopping without becoming shopaholics.


377
0:20:32,48 --> 0:20:34,2
Not everyone becomes a food addict.


378
0:20:34,2 --> 0:20:37,32
Not everyone who drinks a glass of wine becomes an alcoholic.


379
0:20:37,32 --> 0:20:40,44
So the real issue is what makes people susceptible


380
0:20:40,44 --> 0:20:44,4
because it's the combination of a susceptible individual


381
0:20:44,4 --> 0:20:47,4
and the potentially addictive substance or behavior


382
0:20:47,4 --> 0:20:51,76
that makes for the full flowering of addiction.


383
0:20:51,76 --> 0:20:54,52
In short, it's not the drug that's addictive


384
0:20:54,52 --> 0:20:57,36
it's the question of the susceptibility of the individual


385
0:20:57,36 --> 0:21:1,36
to being addicted to a particular substance or behavior.


386
0:21:1,36 --> 0:21:2,76
[Environment]


387
0:21:2,76 --> 0:21:4,2
If we wish to understand what


388
0:21:4,2 --> 0:21:6,28
then makes some people susceptible


389
0:21:6,28 --> 0:21:8,8
we actually have to look at the life experience.


390
0:21:8,8 --> 0:21:14,12
The old idea, although it's old but it's still


391
0:21:14,12 --> 0:21:17,44
broadly held, that addictions are due to some genetic cause


392
0:21:17,44 --> 0:21:20,6
is simply scientifically untenable.


393
0:21:20,6 --> 0:21:23,92
What the case is actually is that certain life experiences


394
0:21:23,92 --> 0:21:25,64
make people susceptible.


395
0:21:25,64 --> 0:21:29,72
Life experiences that not only shape the person's


396
0:21:29,72 --> 0:21:33,28
personality and psychological needs


397
0:21:33,28 --> 0:21:36,4
but also their very brains in certain ways.


398
0:21:36,4 --> 0:21:41,8
And that process begins in utero.


399
0:21:41,8 --> 0:21:43,2
[Prenatal]


400
0:21:43,2 --> 0:21:44,84
It has been shown, for example


401
0:21:44,84 --> 0:21:48,52
that if you stress mothers during pregnancy


402
0:21:48,52 --> 0:21:50,24
their children are more likely to have


403
0:21:50,24 --> 0:21:52,96
traits that predispose them to addictions


404
0:21:52,96 --> 0:21:55,12
and that's because development is shaped


405
0:21:55,12 --> 0:21:57,48
by the psychological and social environment.


406
0:21:57,48 --> 0:22:1,92
So the biology of human beings is very much affected by


407
0:22:1,92 --> 0:22:6,68
and programmed by the life experiences beginning in utero.


408
0:22:6,68 --> 0:22:8,72
Environment does not begin at birth.


409
0:22:8,72 --> 0:22:11,24
Environment begins as soon as you have an environment.


410
0:22:11,24 --> 0:22:14,8
As soon as you are a fetus, you are subject to whatever


411
0:22:14,8 --> 0:22:17,52
information is coming through mom's circulations.


412
0:22:17,52 --> 0:22:19,32
Hormones, levels of nutrients...


413
0:22:19,32 --> 0:22:21,6
A great landmark example of this is


414
0:22:21,6 --> 0:22:24,36
something called the Dutch Hongerwinter.


415
0:22:24,36 --> 0:22:28,8
In 1944, Nazis occupying Holland


416
0:22:28,8 --> 0:22:30,2
for a bunch of reasons, they decide to


417
0:22:30,2 --> 0:22:32,48
take all the food and divert it to Germany;


418
0:22:32,48 --> 0:22:34,56
for three months everybody there was starving.


419
0:22:34,56 --> 0:22:36,68
Tens of thousands of people starve to death.


420
0:22:36,68 --> 0:22:38,84
What the Dutch hunger winter effect is:


421
0:22:38,84 --> 0:22:43,72
if you were a second or third trimester fetus during the starvation


422
0:22:43,72 --> 0:22:47,76
your body 'learned' something very unique during that time.


423
0:22:47,76 --> 0:22:51,0
As it turns out, second and third trimester is when your body is


424
0:22:51,0 --> 0:22:53,56
going about trying to learn about the environment:


425
0:22:53,56 --> 0:22:57,4
How menacing of a place is it out there?


426
0:22:57,4 --> 0:23:0,2
How plentiful? How much nutrients am I getting


427
0:23:0,2 --> 0:23:2,28
by way of mom's circulation?


428
0:23:2,28 --> 0:23:6,6
Be a fetus who was starving during that time and your body


429
0:23:6,6 --> 0:23:9,4
programs forever after to be


430
0:23:9,4 --> 0:23:13,96
really, really stingy with your sugar and fat and


431
0:23:13,96 --> 0:23:16,48
what you do is you store every bit of it.


432
0:23:16,48 --> 0:23:19,88
Be a Dutch Hunger Winter fetus and half a century later


433
0:23:19,88 --> 0:23:21,6
everything else being equal


434
0:23:21,6 --> 0:23:24,76
you are more likely to have high blood pressure


435
0:23:24,76 --> 0:23:26,56
obesity or metabolic syndrome.


436
0:23:26,56 --> 0:23:30,76
That is environment coming in a very unexpected place.


437
0:23:30,76 --> 0:23:34,36
You can stress animals in the laboratory when they're pregnant


438
0:23:34,36 --> 0:23:35,96
and their offspring will be more


439
0:23:35,96 --> 0:23:38,44
likely to use cocaine and alcohol as adults.


440
0:23:38,44 --> 0:23:41,96
You can stress human mothers. For example, in a British study


441
0:23:41,96 --> 0:23:44,92
women who were abused in pregnancy


442
0:23:44,92 --> 0:23:46,84
will have higher levels of


443
0:23:46,84 --> 0:23:49,92
the stress hormone cortisol in their placenta at birth


444
0:23:49,92 --> 0:23:52,8
and their children are more likely to have conditions that


445
0:23:52,8 --> 0:23:55,6
predispose them to addictions by age 7 or 8.


446
0:23:55,6 --> 0:23:58,64
So in utero stress already prepares the gun


447
0:23:58,64 --> 0:24:0,64
for all kinds of mental health issues.


448
0:24:0,64 --> 0:24:4,44
An Israeli study done on children


449
0:24:4,44 --> 0:24:7,0
born to mothers who were pregnant


450
0:24:7,0 --> 0:24:12,24
prior to the onset of the 1967 war...


451
0:24:12,24 --> 0:24:14,2
These women, of course, were very stressed


452
0:24:14,2 --> 0:24:16,92
and their offspring have a higher incidence of schizophrenia


453
0:24:16,92 --> 0:24:18,84
than the average cohort.


454
0:24:18,84 --> 0:24:22,16
So, there is plenty of evidence now that prenatal


455
0:24:22,16 --> 0:24:28,4
effects have a huge impact on the developing human being.


456
0:24:28,4 --> 0:24:30,24
[Infancy]


457
0:24:30,24 --> 0:24:31,68
The point about human development and


458
0:24:31,68 --> 0:24:33,4
specifically human brain development


459
0:24:33,4 --> 0:24:35,36
is that it occurs mostly under the impact of the environment


460
0:24:35,36 --> 0:24:37,32
and mostly after birth.


461
0:24:37,32 --> 0:24:39,96
Now, if you compare us to a horse


462
0:24:39,96 --> 0:24:41,96
which can run on the first day of life


463
0:24:41,96 --> 0:24:45,84
we see that we are very undeveloped.


464
0:24:45,84 --> 0:24:49,64
We can't muster that much neurological coordination


465
0:24:49,64 --> 0:24:52,32
balance, muscle strength, visual acuity


466
0:24:52,32 --> 0:24:54,16
until a year and a half, two years of age.


467
0:24:54,16 --> 0:24:56,8
That's because the brain development in the horse


468
0:24:56,8 --> 0:24:58,68
happens in the safety of the womb


469
0:24:58,68 --> 0:25:1,84
and in the human being, it has to happen after birth


470
0:25:1,84 --> 0:25:4,36
and that has to do with simple evolutionary logic.


471
0:25:4,36 --> 0:25:8,68
As the head gets larger, which is what makes us into human beings


472
0:25:8,68 --> 0:25:11,16
the burgeoning of the forebrain is


473
0:25:11,16 --> 0:25:13,64
what creates the human species, actually.


474
0:25:13,64 --> 0:25:16,76
At the same time, we walk on two legs. So, our pelvis narrows


475
0:25:16,76 --> 0:25:18,24
to accommodate that. So now we


476
0:25:18,24 --> 0:25:20,64
have a narrower pelvis, a larger head


477
0:25:20,64 --> 0:25:22,64
Bingo! We have to be born prematurely.


478
0:25:22,64 --> 0:25:25,4
And that means the brain development that in other animals


479
0:25:25,4 --> 0:25:26,48
occurs in utero


480
0:25:26,48 --> 0:25:28,52
in us, occurs after birth


481
0:25:28,52 --> 0:25:30,92
and much of that under the impact of the environment.


482
0:25:30,92 --> 0:25:35,8
The concept of Neural Darwinism simply means


483
0:25:35,8 --> 0:25:38,12
that the circuits that get the appropriate input from the environment


484
0:25:38,12 --> 0:25:40,8
will develop optimally and the ones that don't


485
0:25:40,8 --> 0:25:43,72
will either not develop optimally or perhaps not at all.


486
0:25:43,72 --> 0:25:46,64
If you take a child with perfectly good eyes at birth


487
0:25:46,64 --> 0:25:48,84
and you put him in a dark room for five years


488
0:25:48,84 --> 0:25:51,8
he will be blind thereafter for the rest of his life


489
0:25:51,8 --> 0:25:55,2
because the circuits of vision require light waves for their development


490
0:25:55,2 --> 0:25:57,68
and without that even the rudimentary


491
0:25:57,68 --> 0:26:0,2
circuit's present and active at birth


492
0:26:0,2 --> 0:26:6,48
will atrophy and die and new ones will not develop.


493
0:26:6,48 --> 0:26:7,84
[Memory]


494
0:26:7,84 --> 0:26:10,52
There is a significant way in which


495
0:26:10,52 --> 0:26:16,8
early experiences shape adult behavior


496
0:26:16,8 --> 0:26:18,24
and even and especially early


497
0:26:18,24 --> 0:26:21,72
experiences for which there is no recall memory.


498
0:26:21,72 --> 0:26:24,0
It turns out that there are two kinds of memory:


499
0:26:24,0 --> 0:26:26,6
there is explicit memory which is recall


500
0:26:26,6 --> 0:26:29,72
this is when you can call back facts


501
0:26:29,72 --> 0:26:32,56
details, episodes, circumstances.


502
0:26:32,56 --> 0:26:35,48
But the structure in the brain which is called the hippocampus


503
0:26:35,48 --> 0:26:37,32
which encodes recall memory


504
0:26:37,32 --> 0:26:40,44
doesn't even begin to develop fully until a year and a half


505
0:26:40,44 --> 0:26:42,4
and it is not fully developed until much later.


506
0:26:42,4 --> 0:26:44,6
Which is why hardly anybody has


507
0:26:44,6 --> 0:26:47,12
any recall memory prior to 18 months.


508
0:26:47,12 --> 0:26:48,32
But there is another kind of


509
0:26:48,32 --> 0:26:49,92
memory which is called implicit memory


510
0:26:49,92 --> 0:26:52,8
which is, in fact, an emotional memory


511
0:26:52,8 --> 0:26:56,72
where the emotional impact and the interpretation the child makes


512
0:26:56,72 --> 0:26:59,76
of those emotional experiences are ingrained in the brain


513
0:26:59,76 --> 0:27:1,84
in the form of nerve circuits ready to fire


514
0:27:1,84 --> 0:27:3,44
without specific recall.


515
0:27:3,44 --> 0:27:5,24
So to give you a clear example


516
0:27:5,24 --> 0:27:7,24
people who are adopted have a


517
0:27:7,24 --> 0:27:9,84
lifelong sense of rejection very often.


518
0:27:9,84 --> 0:27:11,12
They can't recall the adoption.


519
0:27:11,12 --> 0:27:13,24
They can't recall the separation of the birth mother


520
0:27:13,24 --> 0:27:15,2
because there's nothing there to recall with.


521
0:27:15,2 --> 0:27:18,6
But the emotional memory of separation and rejection


522
0:27:18,6 --> 0:27:20,84
is deeply embedded in their brains.


523
0:27:20,84 --> 0:27:22,48
Hence, they are much more likely


524
0:27:22,48 --> 0:27:24,2
to experience a sense of rejection


525
0:27:24,2 --> 0:27:26,6
and a great emotional upset


526
0:27:26,6 --> 0:27:29,16
when they perceive themselves as being rejected


527
0:27:29,16 --> 0:27:30,16
by other people.


528
0:27:30,16 --> 0:27:31,68
That's not unique to people who are


529
0:27:31,68 --> 0:27:33,6
adopted but it is particularly strong in them


530
0:27:33,6 --> 0:27:36,24
because of this function of implicit memory.


531
0:27:36,24 --> 0:27:39,36
People who are addicted, given all the


532
0:27:39,36 --> 0:27:42,64
research literature and in my experience


533
0:27:42,64 --> 0:27:47,2
the hard-core addicts virtually were all


534
0:27:47,2 --> 0:27:49,36
significantly abused as children


535
0:27:49,36 --> 0:27:51,52
or suffered severe emotional loss.


536
0:27:51,52 --> 0:27:54,0
Their emotional or implicit memories


537
0:27:54,0 --> 0:27:56,44
are those of a world that's not safe


538
0:27:56,44 --> 0:28:0,52
and not helpful; caregivers who were not to be trusted


539
0:28:0,52 --> 0:28:3,2
and relationships that are not


540
0:28:3,2 --> 0:28:6,32
safe enough to open up to vulnerability


541
0:28:6,32 --> 0:28:7,88
and hence their responses tend


542
0:28:7,88 --> 0:28:9,6
to be to keep themselves separate from


543
0:28:9,6 --> 0:28:11,52
really intimate relationships;


544
0:28:11,52 --> 0:28:14,8
not to trust caregivers


545
0:28:14,8 --> 0:28:17,0
doctors and other people who are trying to help them


546
0:28:17,0 --> 0:28:20,12
and generally see the world as an unsafe place...


547
0:28:20,12 --> 0:28:24,92
and that is strictly a function of implicit memory


548
0:28:24,92 --> 0:28:32,16
which sometimes has to do with incidents they don't even recall.


549
0:28:32,16 --> 0:28:34,4
[Touch]


550
0:28:34,4 --> 0:28:36,76
Infants who are born premature or often in incubators


551
0:28:36,76 --> 0:28:39,24
and various types of gadgetry and


552
0:28:39,24 --> 0:28:42,8
machinery for weeks and perhaps months,


553
0:28:42,8 --> 0:28:43,64
it's now known that if these


554
0:28:43,64 --> 0:28:46,4
children are touched and stroked on the back


555
0:28:46,4 --> 0:28:49,68
for just 10 minutes a day that promotes their brain development.


556
0:28:49,68 --> 0:28:52,44
So, human touch is essential for development


557
0:28:52,44 --> 0:28:56,32
and, in fact, infants who are never picked up will actually die.


558
0:28:56,32 --> 0:28:58,76
That is how much of a fundamental


559
0:28:58,76 --> 0:29:1,36
need being held is to human beings.


560
0:29:1,36 --> 0:29:4,24
In our society, there is an unfortunate tendency


561
0:29:4,24 --> 0:29:7,0
to tell parents not to pick up their kids, not to hold them


562
0:29:7,0 --> 0:29:12,92
not to pick up babies who are crying for fear of spoiling them


563
0:29:12,92 --> 0:29:15,4
or to encourage them to sleep through the night


564
0:29:15,4 --> 0:29:16,2
you don't pick them up...


565
0:29:16,2 --> 0:29:18,64
which is just the opposite of what the child needs


566
0:29:18,64 --> 0:29:22,0
and these children might go back to sleep because they give up


567
0:29:22,0 --> 0:29:24,32
and their brains just shut down as a


568
0:29:24,32 --> 0:29:27,4
way of defending against the vulnerability


569
0:29:27,4 --> 0:29:29,96
of being abandoned really by their parents


570
0:29:29,96 --> 0:29:31,76
but their implicit memories will be


571
0:29:31,76 --> 0:29:35,72
that of the world that doesn't give a damn.


572
0:29:35,72 --> 0:29:37,84
[Childhood]


573
0:29:37,84 --> 0:29:42,88
A lot of these differences are structured very early in life.


574
0:29:42,88 --> 0:29:48,28
In a way, the parental experience of adversity


575
0:29:48,28 --> 0:29:51,0
how tough life is or how easy it is


576
0:29:51,0 --> 0:29:52,84
is passed on to children


577
0:29:52,84 --> 0:29:55,28
whether through maternal depression


578
0:29:55,28 --> 0:29:56,84
or parents being bad tempered with


579
0:29:56,84 --> 0:29:58,8
their kids because they have had a hard day


580
0:29:58,8 --> 0:30:2,52
or just being too tired at the end of the day...


581
0:30:2,52 --> 0:30:6,4
and these have very powerful effects programming


582
0:30:6,4 --> 0:30:9,88
children's development, which we know a lot about now


583
0:30:9,88 --> 0:30:14,76
But that early sensitivity isn't just an evolutionary mistake.


584
0:30:14,76 --> 0:30:17,44
It exists again in many different species.


585
0:30:17,44 --> 0:30:20,56
Even in seedlings there's an early adaptive process


586
0:30:20,56 --> 0:30:22,68
to the kind of environment they are growing up in


587
0:30:22,68 --> 0:30:28,32
but for humans, the adaptation is to the quality of social relations.


588
0:30:28,32 --> 0:30:31,4
And so, early life:


589
0:30:31,4 --> 0:30:35,2
how nurturing, how much conflict, how much attention you get


590
0:30:35,2 --> 0:30:40,2
is a taster of the kind of world you may be growing up in.


591
0:30:40,2 --> 0:30:41,72
Are you growing up in a world where


592
0:30:41,72 --> 0:30:43,36
you have to fight for what you can get;


593
0:30:43,36 --> 0:30:47,4
watch your back; fend for yourself; learn not to trust others?...


594
0:30:47,4 --> 0:30:50,36
or are you growing up in a society where you depend on


595
0:30:50,36 --> 0:30:55,24
reciprocity, mutuality, cooperation, where empathy is important


596
0:30:55,24 --> 0:30:59,4
where your security depends on good relations with other people?...


597
0:30:59,4 --> 0:31:1,16
and that needs a very different


598
0:31:1,16 --> 0:31:3,48
emotional and cognitive development


599
0:31:3,48 --> 0:31:6,68
and that's what the early sensitivity is about


600
0:31:6,68 --> 0:31:10,6
and parenting is almost, quite unconsciously


601
0:31:10,6 --> 0:31:13,92
a system for passing on that experience to children...


602
0:31:13,92 --> 0:31:16,52
of the kind of world they are in.


603
0:31:16,52 --> 0:31:20,32
The great British child psychiatrist, DW Winnicott, said


604
0:31:20,32 --> 0:31:23,32
that fundamentally, two things can go wrong in childhood.


605
0:31:23,32 --> 0:31:26,48
One is when things happen that shouldn't happen


606
0:31:26,48 --> 0:31:29,6
and then things that should happen but don't.


607
0:31:29,6 --> 0:31:33,52
In the first category, is the dramatic, abusive


608
0:31:33,52 --> 0:31:36,4
and abandonment experiences of my


609
0:31:36,4 --> 0:31:39,56
downtown Eastside patients and of many addicts.


610
0:31:39,56 --> 0:31:42,8
That's what shouldn't happen but did.


611
0:31:42,8 --> 0:31:46,8
But then there is the non-stressed


612
0:31:46,8 --> 0:31:48,6
attuned, non-distracted attention


613
0:31:48,6 --> 0:31:51,28
of the parent that every child needs


614
0:31:51,28 --> 0:31:53,2
that very often children don't get.


615
0:31:53,2 --> 0:31:55,24
They're not abused. They are not neglected


616
0:31:55,24 --> 0:31:58,0
and they're not traumatized


617
0:31:58,0 --> 0:31:59,68
but what should happen


618
0:31:59,68 --> 0:32:2,88
the presence of the emotionally available nurturing parent


619
0:32:2,88 --> 0:32:5,2
just is not available to them because of the


620
0:32:5,2 --> 0:32:7,56
stresses in our society and the parenting environment.


621
0:32:7,56 --> 0:32:14,24
The psychologist Allan Surer calls that "Proximal Abandonment"


622
0:32:14,24 --> 0:32:17,16
when the parent is physically present


623
0:32:17,16 --> 0:32:20,44
but emotionally absent.


624
0:32:20,44 --> 0:32:23,24
I have spent...


625
0:32:23,24 --> 0:32:27,4
roughly the last 40 years of my life


626
0:32:27,4 --> 0:32:31,88
working with the most violent of people our society produces:


627
0:32:31,88 --> 0:32:34,2
murderers, rapists and so on.


628
0:32:34,2 --> 0:32:38,0
In an attempt to understand what causes this violence.


629
0:32:38,0 --> 0:32:42,48
I discovered that the most violent of the criminals in our prisons


630
0:32:42,48 --> 0:32:45,44
had themselves been victims


631
0:32:45,44 --> 0:32:48,28
of a degree of child abuse that was beyond the scale of


632
0:32:48,28 --> 0:32:51,12
what I ever thought of applying the term child abuse to.


633
0:32:51,12 --> 0:32:54,64
I had no idea of the depth


634
0:32:54,64 --> 0:32:58,64
of the depravity with which children in our society


635
0:32:58,64 --> 0:33:0,56
are all too often treated.


636
0:33:0,56 --> 0:33:4,48
The most violent people I saw were themselves the survivors


637
0:33:4,48 --> 0:33:7,68
of their own attempted murder often at the hands of their parents


638
0:33:7,68 --> 0:33:11,8
or other people in their social environment


639
0:33:11,8 --> 0:33:14,6
or were the survivors of family members who had been killed


640
0:33:14,6 --> 0:33:19,28
their closest family members, by other people.


641
0:33:19,28 --> 0:33:23,84
The Buddha argued that everything depends on everything else.


642
0:33:23,84 --> 0:33:26,76
He says 'the one contains the many and the many contains the one'.


643
0:33:26,76 --> 0:33:30,36
That you can't understand anything in isolation from its environment.


644
0:33:30,36 --> 0:33:38,56
The leaf contains the sun, the sky and the earth, obviously.


645
0:33:38,56 --> 0:33:41,4
This has now been shown to be true, of course


646
0:33:41,4 --> 0:33:44,44
all around and specifically when it comes to human development.


647
0:33:44,44 --> 0:33:46,92
The modern scientific term for it


648
0:33:46,92 --> 0:33:49,76
is the "bio psycho social" nature of human development


649
0:33:49,76 --> 0:33:52,8
which says that the biology of human beings


650
0:33:52,8 --> 0:33:54,4
depends very much on their interaction with


651
0:33:54,4 --> 0:33:56,64
the social and psychological environment.


652
0:33:56,64 --> 0:34:2,36
Specifically, the psychiatrist and researcher


653
0:34:2,36 --> 0:34:6,84
Daniel Siegel at the University of California, Los Angeles, UCLA


654
0:34:6,84 --> 0:34:10,8
has coined a phrase “Interpersonal Neurobiology”


655
0:34:10,8 --> 0:34:12,32
which means to say that the way


656
0:34:12,32 --> 0:34:14,72
that our nervous system functions


657
0:34:14,72 --> 0:34:17,48
depends very much on our personal relationships.


658
0:34:17,48 --> 0:34:20,32
In the first place with the parenting caregivers and in the


659
0:34:20,32 --> 0:34:23,48
second place with other important attachment figures in our lives


660
0:34:23,48 --> 0:34:26,16
and in the third-place, with our entire culture.


661
0:34:26,16 --> 0:34:28,28
So that you can't separate the


662
0:34:28,28 --> 0:34:31,12
neurological functioning of a human being


663
0:34:31,12 --> 0:34:35,8
from the environment in which he or she grew up in


664
0:34:35,8 --> 0:34:37,56
and continues to exist in


665
0:34:37,56 --> 0:34:40,32
and this is true throughout the lifecycle.


666
0:34:40,32 --> 0:34:42,12
It's particularly true when you are


667
0:34:42,12 --> 0:34:44,8
dependent and helpless when your brain is developing


668
0:34:44,8 --> 0:34:51,92
but it's true even in adults and even at the end of life.


669
0:34:51,92 --> 0:34:53,24
[Culture]


670
0:34:53,24 --> 0:34:56,84
Human beings have lived in almost every kind of society.


671
0:34:56,84 --> 0:35:1,56
From the most egalitarian... hunting and gathering societies


672
0:35:1,56 --> 0:35:3,56
seem to have been very egalitarian


673
0:35:3,56 --> 0:35:6,6
for instance, based on food sharing, gift exchange...


674
0:35:6,6 --> 0:35:9,76
Small bands of people living predominately


675
0:35:9,76 --> 0:35:13,16
off of foraging and a little bit of hunting


676
0:35:13,16 --> 0:35:15,24
predominantly among people you have


677
0:35:15,24 --> 0:35:17,28
at the least, known your entire life


678
0:35:17,28 --> 0:35:20,24
if not surrounded by third cousins or closer;


679
0:35:20,24 --> 0:35:22,12
in a world in which there is a great


680
0:35:22,12 --> 0:35:24,24
deal of fluidity between different groups;


681
0:35:24,24 --> 0:35:26,0
in a world which there is not a


682
0:35:26,0 --> 0:35:28,12
whole lot in terms of material culture...


683
0:35:28,12 --> 0:35:31,4
this is how humans have spent most of their hominid history.


684
0:35:31,4 --> 0:35:34,52
And no surprise, that makes for a very different world.


685
0:35:34,52 --> 0:35:38,92
One of the things you get as a result of that is far less violence.


686
0:35:38,92 --> 0:35:41,8
Organized group violence is not


687
0:35:41,8 --> 0:35:43,2
something that occurred at that time


688
0:35:43,2 --> 0:35:46,88
of human history and that seems quite clear.


689
0:35:46,88 --> 0:35:50,4
So where did we go wrong?


690
0:35:50,4 --> 0:35:54,48
Violence is not universal.


691
0:35:54,48 --> 0:35:58,32
It is not symmetrically distributed throughout the human race.


692
0:35:58,32 --> 0:36:3,4
There is a huge variation in the amount of violence in different societies.


693
0:36:3,4 --> 0:36:7,28
There are some societies that have virtually no violence.


694
0:36:7,28 --> 0:36:10,84
There are others that destroy themselves.


695
0:36:10,84 --> 0:36:14,16
Some of the Anabaptist religious


696
0:36:14,16 --> 0:36:18,4
groups that are complete strict pacifists


697
0:36:18,4 --> 0:36:21,24
like the Amish, the Mennonites, the Hutterites...


698
0:36:21,24 --> 0:36:24,4
among some of these groups, the Hutterites


699
0:36:24,4 --> 0:36:29,44
there are no recorded cases of homicide.


700
0:36:29,44 --> 0:36:32,6
During our major wars, like World War II


701
0:36:32,6 --> 0:36:34,64
where people were being drafted


702
0:36:34,64 --> 0:36:36,96
they would refuse to serve in the military.


703
0:36:36,96 --> 0:36:40,0
They would go to prison rather than serve in the military


704
0:36:40,0 --> 0:36:42,44
In the Kibbutzim in Israel


705
0:36:42,44 --> 0:36:45,92
the level of violence is so low that the criminal courts there


706
0:36:45,92 --> 0:36:48,6
will often send violent offenders


707
0:36:48,6 --> 0:36:51,2
people who have committed crimes


708
0:36:51,2 --> 0:36:54,12
to live on the Kibbutzim in order to


709
0:36:54,12 --> 0:36:56,2
learn how to live a non-violent life...


710
0:36:56,2 --> 0:36:58,52
because that's the way people live there.


711
0:36:58,52 --> 0:37:2,24
So, we are amply shaped by society.


712
0:37:2,24 --> 0:37:7,52
Our societies, in the broader sense including our theological


713
0:37:7,52 --> 0:37:11,0
our metaphysical, our linguistic influences, etc.


714
0:37:11,0 --> 0:37:14,84
our societies help shape us as to whether or not we think


715
0:37:14,84 --> 0:37:18,8
life is basically about sin or about beauty;


716
0:37:18,8 --> 0:37:20,8
whether the afterlife will carry a price for


717
0:37:20,8 --> 0:37:23,6
how we live our lives or if it's irrelevant.


718
0:37:23,6 --> 0:37:27,0
In a broad sort of way different large societies could


719
0:37:27,0 --> 0:37:29,12
be termed as individualistic or


720
0:37:29,12 --> 0:37:32,2
collectivist and you get very different people


721
0:37:32,2 --> 0:37:33,92
and different mindsets and I suspect


722
0:37:33,92 --> 0:37:35,72
different brains coming along with that.


723
0:37:35,72 --> 0:37:40,12
We, in America, are in one of the most individualistic of societies.


724
0:37:40,12 --> 0:37:43,92
With capitalism being a system that allows you to go


725
0:37:43,92 --> 0:37:47,56
higher and higher up a potential pyramid and


726
0:37:47,56 --> 0:37:50,56
the deal is that it comes with fewer and fewer safety nets.


727
0:37:50,56 --> 0:37:54,8
By definition, the more stratified a society is


728
0:37:54,8 --> 0:37:57,6
the fewer people you have as peers - the fewer people with whom


729
0:37:57,6 --> 0:38:0,88
you have symmetrical, reciprocal relationships -


730
0:38:0,88 --> 0:38:5,64
and instead, all you have are differing spots and endless hierarchies...


731
0:38:5,64 --> 0:38:8,68
A world in which you have few reciprocal partners


732
0:38:8,68 --> 0:38:14,32
is a world with a lot less altruism.


733
0:38:14,32 --> 0:38:17,84
[Human Nature]


734
0:38:17,84 --> 0:38:22,2
So, this brings us to a total impossible juncture which is


735
0:38:22,2 --> 0:38:25,52
to try to make sense in perspective science...


736
0:38:25,52 --> 0:38:28,2
as to what that nature is of human nature.


737
0:38:28,2 --> 0:38:30,68
You know, on a certain level


738
0:38:30,68 --> 0:38:33,24
the nature of our nature is not to be


739
0:38:33,24 --> 0:38:36,0
particularly constrained by our nature.


740
0:38:36,0 --> 0:38:37,84
We come up with more social


741
0:38:37,84 --> 0:38:40,44
variability than any species out there.


742
0:38:40,44 --> 0:38:44,76
More systems of belief, of styles of family structures


743
0:38:44,76 --> 0:38:47,76
of ways of raising children. The capacity


744
0:38:47,76 --> 0:38:51,8
for variety that we have is extraordinary.


745
0:38:51,8 --> 0:38:55,56
In a society which is predicated on competition


746
0:38:55,56 --> 0:39:1,4
and really, very often, the ruthless exploitation


747
0:39:1,4 --> 0:39:3,8
of one human being by another


748
0:39:3,8 --> 0:39:6,28
the profiteering off of other people's problems


749
0:39:6,28 --> 0:39:8,56
and very often the creation of


750
0:39:8,56 --> 0:39:11,64
problems for the purpose of profiteering


751
0:39:11,64 --> 0:39:14,92
the ruling ideology will very often justify that behavior


752
0:39:14,92 --> 0:39:19,0
by appeals to some fundamental and unalterable human nature.


753
0:39:19,0 --> 0:39:20,72
So the myth in our society is


754
0:39:20,72 --> 0:39:22,92
that people are competitive by nature


755
0:39:22,92 --> 0:39:27,12
and that they are individualistic and that they're selfish.


756
0:39:27,12 --> 0:39:30,12
The real reality is quite the opposite.


757
0:39:30,12 --> 0:39:31,72
We have certain human needs.


758
0:39:31,72 --> 0:39:34,52
The only way that you can talk about human nature concretely


759
0:39:34,52 --> 0:39:37,24
is by recognizing that there are certain human needs.


760
0:39:37,24 --> 0:39:40,4
We have a human need for companionship and for close contact


761
0:39:40,4 --> 0:39:43,48
to be loved, to be attached to, to be accepted


762
0:39:43,48 --> 0:39:47,52
to be seen, to be received for who we are.


763
0:39:47,52 --> 0:39:50,4
If those needs are met, we develop


764
0:39:50,4 --> 0:39:52,44
into people who are compassionate


765
0:39:52,44 --> 0:39:58,44
and cooperative and who have empathy for other people.


766
0:39:58,44 --> 0:40:1,2
So...


767
0:40:1,2 --> 0:40:3,32
the opposite, that we often see in our


768
0:40:3,32 --> 0:40:5,88
society is, in fact, a distortion of human nature


769
0:40:5,88 --> 0:40:9,28
precisely because so few people have their needs met.


770
0:40:9,28 --> 0:40:11,68
So, yes you can talk about human nature


771
0:40:11,68 --> 0:40:14,2
but only in the sense of basic human needs


772
0:40:14,2 --> 0:40:16,36
that are instinctively evoked


773
0:40:16,36 --> 0:40:18,72
or I should say, certain human needs


774
0:40:18,72 --> 0:40:21,64
that lead to certain traits if they are met


775
0:40:21,64 --> 0:40:27,2
and a different set of traits if they are denied.


776
0:40:27,2 --> 0:40:28,84
So...


777
0:40:28,84 --> 0:40:31,88
when we recognize the fact that the human organism


778
0:40:31,88 --> 0:40:34,48
which has a great deal of adaptive flexibility


779
0:40:34,48 --> 0:40:37,84
allowing us to survive in many different conditions


780
0:40:37,84 --> 0:40:42,12
is also rigidly programmed for certain environmental requirements


781
0:40:42,12 --> 0:40:44,52
or human needs


782
0:40:44,52 --> 0:40:47,92
a social imperative begins to emerge.


783
0:40:47,92 --> 0:40:50,76
Just as our bodies require physical nutrients


784
0:40:50,76 --> 0:40:55,16
the human brain demands positive forms of environmental stimulus


785
0:40:55,16 --> 0:40:57,64
at all stages of development


786
0:40:57,64 --> 0:41:0,0
while also needing to be protected


787
0:41:0,0 --> 0:41:3,8
from other negative forms of stimulus.


788
0:41:3,8 --> 0:41:5,6
And if things that should happen, do not...


789
0:41:5,6 --> 0:41:8,16
or if things that shouldn't happen, do...


790
0:41:8,16 --> 0:41:11,48
it is now apparent that the door can be opened for not only


791
0:41:11,48 --> 0:41:14,64
a cascade of mental and physical diseases


792
0:41:14,64 --> 0:41:18,4
but many detrimental human behaviors as well.


793
0:41:18,4 --> 0:41:21,8
So, as we turn our perspective now outward


794
0:41:21,8 --> 0:41:23,92
and take account for the state of affairs today


795
0:41:23,92 --> 0:41:26,16
we must ask the question:


796
0:41:26,16 --> 0:41:28,92
Is the condition we have created in the modern world


797
0:41:28,92 --> 0:41:31,8
actually supporting our health?


798
0:41:31,8 --> 0:41:34,12
Is the bedrock of our socioeconomic


799
0:41:34,12 --> 0:41:36,36
system acting as a positive force


800
0:41:36,36 --> 0:41:40,36
for human and social development and progress?


801
0:41:40,36 --> 0:41:44,4
Or, is the foundational gravitation of our society


802
0:41:44,4 --> 0:41:48,92
actually going against the core evolutionary requirements


803
0:41:48,92 --> 0:41:51,48
needed to create and maintain


804
0:41:51,48 --> 0:42:11,56
our personal and social well-being?


805
0:42:11,56 --> 0:42:17,96
[Part II: Social Pathology]


806
0:42:17,96 --> 0:42:21,36
So, one might ask where did this all begin?


807
0:42:21,36 --> 0:42:24,64
What we have today... really a world in a state of


808
0:42:24,64 --> 0:42:27,88
cumulative collapse.


809
0:42:27,88 --> 0:42:30,64
[The Market]


810
0:42:30,64 --> 0:42:33,36
You get it started with John Locke.


811
0:42:33,36 --> 0:42:36,16
And John Locke introduces property.


812
0:42:36,16 --> 0:42:40,88
He has three provisos for just private right and property.


813
0:42:40,88 --> 0:42:42,64
And the three provisos are:


814
0:42:42,64 --> 0:42:45,28
There must be enough left over for others


815
0:42:45,28 --> 0:42:47,32
and that you must not let it spoil


816
0:42:47,32 --> 0:42:51,8
and that you, most of all, must mix your labor with it.


817
0:42:51,8 --> 0:42:54,32
It seems justified- you mix your labor with the world


818
0:42:54,32 --> 0:42:56,48
then you are entitled to the product


819
0:42:56,48 --> 0:42:59,28
and as long as there's enough left over for others


820
0:42:59,28 --> 0:43:1,56
and as long as it doesn't spoil


821
0:43:1,56 --> 0:43:4,8
and you don't allow anything to go to waste then that's okay.


822
0:43:4,8 --> 0:43:7,32
He spends a long time on this and his famous treatise of government


823
0:43:7,32 --> 0:43:10,24
and it's since been the canonical text


824
0:43:10,24 --> 0:43:13,52
for economic and political and legal understanding.


825
0:43:13,52 --> 0:43:16,88
It is still the classic text that's studied.


826
0:43:16,88 --> 0:43:20,12
Well - after he gives the provisos


827
0:43:20,12 --> 0:43:22,4
and you're almost thinking at the time whether you


828
0:43:22,4 --> 0:43:23,52
are for private property or not


829
0:43:23,52 --> 0:43:28,0
he has given a very good plausible and powerful defense


830
0:43:28,0 --> 0:43:29,72
of private property here...


831
0:43:29,72 --> 0:43:31,16
Well, he drops them!


832
0:43:31,16 --> 0:43:33,96
He drops them like that. Right in one sentence.


833
0:43:33,96 --> 0:43:35,96
He says, 'Well, once the introduction


834
0:43:35,96 --> 0:43:38,64
of money came in by men's tacit consent


835
0:43:38,64 --> 0:43:40,2
then it became...'


836
0:43:40,2 --> 0:43:43,92
and he doesn't say all the provisos are canceled or erased-


837
0:43:43,92 --> 0:43:46,12
but that's what happens.


838
0:43:46,12 --> 0:43:48,2
So, now we have not


839
0:43:48,2 --> 0:43:50,84
product and your property earned by your own labor-


840
0:43:50,84 --> 0:43:53,92
oh no- money buys labor now.


841
0:43:53,92 --> 0:43:55,44
There is no longer consideration


842
0:43:55,44 --> 0:43:57,84
whether there is enough left over for others;


843
0:43:57,84 --> 0:44:0,24
there is no longer consideration of whether it spoils


844
0:44:0,24 --> 0:44:1,76
because he says money is like


845
0:44:1,76 --> 0:44:3,56
silver and gold and gold can't spoil


846
0:44:3,56 --> 0:44:7,8
and therefore money can't be responsible for waste...


847
0:44:7,8 --> 0:44:9,56
which is ridiculous. We are not talking about money


848
0:44:9,56 --> 0:44:11,92
and silver, we are talking about what its effects are.


849
0:44:11,92 --> 0:44:14,44
It's one non sequitur after another.


850
0:44:14,44 --> 0:44:17,64
Just the most startling


851
0:44:17,64 --> 0:44:21,4
logical legerdemain that he gets away with here


852
0:44:21,4 --> 0:44:26,16
but it fits the interests of capital owners.


853
0:44:26,16 --> 0:44:28,92
Then Adam Smith comes along and what he adds


854
0:44:28,92 --> 0:44:30,64
is the religion to this...


855
0:44:30,64 --> 0:44:33,32
Locke started with God made it all this way


856
0:44:33,32 --> 0:44:34,8
this is God's right


857
0:44:34,8 --> 0:44:36,96
and now we get also with Smith


858
0:44:36,96 --> 0:44:39,12
saying 'it's not only God's...'


859
0:44:39,12 --> 0:44:40,84
well, he's not actually saying this but


860
0:44:40,84 --> 0:44:43,48
this is what's happening philosophically, in principle


861
0:44:43,48 --> 0:44:46,52
he's saying that 'it is not only a question of private property...'


862
0:44:46,52 --> 0:44:49,4
That's all now 'presupposed'- It's Given!


863
0:44:49,4 --> 0:44:51,96
And that there's 'money investors that buy labor' – Given!


864
0:44:51,96 --> 0:44:55,8
There's no limit to how much they can buy of other men's labor


865
0:44:55,8 --> 0:44:57,44
how much they can accumulate, how much 'inequality'-


866
0:44:57,44 --> 0:44:59,32
that's all given now.


867
0:44:59,32 --> 0:45:2,72
And so he comes along and what his big idea is


868
0:45:2,72 --> 0:45:7,52
and again it's just introduced in parentheses, in passing...


869
0:45:7,52 --> 0:45:10,72
You know, when people put out goods for sale - the supply


870
0:45:10,72 --> 0:45:15,64
and other people buy them - the demand and so forth


871
0:45:15,64 --> 0:45:19,64
how do we have supply equaling demand


872
0:45:19,64 --> 0:45:21,16
or demand equaling supply?


873
0:45:21,16 --> 0:45:23,4
how can they come into equilibrium?


874
0:45:23,4 --> 0:45:25,88
and that is one of the central notions of economics


875
0:45:25,88 --> 0:45:28,0
is how do they come into equilibrium...


876
0:45:28,0 --> 0:45:32,32
and he says: it's the “Invisible Hand of the Market”


877
0:45:32,32 --> 0:45:34,2
that brings them into equilibrium.


878
0:45:34,2 --> 0:45:37,12
So, now we have "God is actually imminent”.


879
0:45:37,12 --> 0:45:41,8
He just didn't give the rights to property


880
0:45:41,8 --> 0:45:45,76
and all its wherewithal and its "natural rights"


881
0:45:45,76 --> 0:45:47,28
regarding what Locke said...


882
0:45:47,28 --> 0:45:51,96
now we have the system itself as "God".


883
0:45:51,96 --> 0:45:55,28
In fact, Smith says, when he talks


884
0:45:55,28 --> 0:45:57,52
and you have to read the whole of the


885
0:45:57,52 --> 0:45:59,8
Wealth of Nations' to find this quote.


886
0:45:59,8 --> 0:46:2,52
He says: 'the scantiness of subsistence


887
0:46:2,52 --> 0:46:6,84
sets limits to the reproduction of the poor


888
0:46:6,84 --> 0:46:11,8
and that nature can deal with this in no other way


889
0:46:11,8 --> 0:46:14,48
than elimination of their children.'


890
0:46:14,48 --> 0:46:19,12
So he anticipated evolutionary theory in the worst sense...


891
0:46:19,12 --> 0:46:20,88
this is well before Darwin.


892
0:46:20,88 --> 0:46:23,76
And so he called them the 'Race of Laborers'.


893
0:46:23,76 --> 0:46:27,8
So you can see: there was inherent racism built-in here


894
0:46:27,8 --> 0:46:32,28
there was an inherent life blindness to kill


895
0:46:32,28 --> 0:46:34,88
innumerable children


896
0:46:34,88 --> 0:46:37,96
and he thought: 'that's the Invisible Hand making supply


897
0:46:37,96 --> 0:46:40,8
meet demand and demand meet supply.'


898
0:46:40,8 --> 0:46:43,32
So, see how wise "God" is?


899
0:46:43,32 --> 0:46:46,24
So you can see a lot of the really virulent


900
0:46:46,24 --> 0:46:50,92
life destructive, eco-genocidal things


901
0:46:50,92 --> 0:46:54,52
that are going on now have, in a way,


902
0:46:54,52 --> 0:47:0,4
a 'thought gene' back in Smith too.


903
0:47:0,4 --> 0:47:2,88
When we reflect on the original concept of


904
0:47:2,88 --> 0:47:5,44
the so-called free market - capitalist system


905
0:47:5,44 --> 0:47:8,2
as initiated by early economic philosophers


906
0:47:8,2 --> 0:47:9,72
such as Adam Smith


907
0:47:9,72 --> 0:47:12,84
we see that the original intent of a “market”


908
0:47:12,84 --> 0:47:17,24
was based around real, tangible, life supporting goods for trade.


909
0:47:17,24 --> 0:47:19,72
Adam Smith never fathomed that the most


910
0:47:19,72 --> 0:47:22,16
profitable economic sector on the planet


911
0:47:22,16 --> 0:47:25,8
would eventually be in the arena of financial trading


912
0:47:25,8 --> 0:47:27,2
or so-called investment


913
0:47:27,2 --> 0:47:28,72
where money itself is simply


914
0:47:28,72 --> 0:47:30,76
gained by the movement of other money


915
0:47:30,76 --> 0:47:33,12
in an arbitrary game which holds


916
0:47:33,12 --> 0:47:35,92
zero productive merit to society.


917
0:47:35,92 --> 0:47:38,16
Yet, regardless of Smith's intent


918
0:47:38,16 --> 0:47:40,88
the door for such seemingly anomalous advents


919
0:47:40,88 --> 0:47:45,76
was left wide open by one fundamental tenet of this theory:


920
0:47:45,76 --> 0:47:50,8
Money is treated as a Commodity, in and of itself.


921
0:47:50,8 --> 0:47:52,2
Today, in every economy of the world


922
0:47:52,2 --> 0:47:54,92
regardless of the social system they claim


923
0:47:54,92 --> 0:47:58,92
money is pursued for the sake of money and nothing else.


924
0:47:58,92 --> 0:48:1,96
The underlying idea, which was mysteriously qualified


925
0:48:1,96 --> 0:48:5,8
by Adam Smith with his religious declaration of the


926
0:48:5,8 --> 0:48:7,88
'Invisible Hand'


927
0:48:7,88 --> 0:48:10,48
is that the narrow, self-interested pursuit


928
0:48:10,48 --> 0:48:12,44
of this fictional commodity


929
0:48:12,44 --> 0:48:14,72
will somehow magically manifest


930
0:48:14,72 --> 0:48:18,56
human and social well-being and progress.


931
0:48:18,56 --> 0:48:22,36
The reality is that the monetary incentive interest


932
0:48:22,36 --> 0:48:26,8
or what some have termed the:“Money Sequence of Value”


933
0:48:26,8 --> 0:48:29,28
has now completely decoupled from the foundational


934
0:48:29,28 --> 0:48:32,0
'life interest', which could be termed the


935
0:48:32,0 --> 0:48:34,56
'Life Sequence of Value.'


936
0:48:34,56 --> 0:48:38,36
What has happened is that there is a complete confusion


937
0:48:38,36 --> 0:48:40,48
in economic doctrine


938
0:48:40,48 --> 0:48:42,4
between those two sequences.


939
0:48:42,4 --> 0:48:44,88
They think that the Money Sequence of Value


940
0:48:44,88 --> 0:48:47,8
delivers the Life Sequence of Value


941
0:48:47,8 --> 0:48:49,8
and that's why they say if more goods are sold


942
0:48:49,8 --> 0:48:51,76
If GDP's rise and so forth...


943
0:48:51,76 --> 0:48:54,92
there would be more enhanced well-being


944
0:48:54,92 --> 0:48:58,32
and we could take the GDP as being our basic layer indicator


945
0:48:58,32 --> 0:48:59,6
of social health...


946
0:48:59,6 --> 0:49:1,24
Well, there you see the confusion.


947
0:49:1,24 --> 0:49:3,36
It's talking about Money Sequences of Value


948
0:49:3,36 --> 0:49:5,48
that is, all the receipts and all the revenues that are


949
0:49:5,48 --> 0:49:8,2
derived from selling goods


950
0:49:8,2 --> 0:49:11,92
and they're confusing that with life reproduction.


951
0:49:11,92 --> 0:49:15,6
So, you have built right into this thing from the beginning


952
0:49:15,6 --> 0:49:18,52
a complete conflation of the money


953
0:49:18,52 --> 0:49:20,92
and life sequences of value.


954
0:49:20,92 --> 0:49:24,36
So, we are dealing with a kind of structured delusion


955
0:49:24,36 --> 0:49:26,6
which becomes more and more deadly


956
0:49:26,6 --> 0:49:29,32
as the money sequence decouples from producing


957
0:49:29,32 --> 0:49:30,84
anything at all.


958
0:49:30,84 --> 0:49:33,28
So, it's a system disorder


959
0:49:33,28 --> 0:49:38,16
and the system disorder seems to be fatal.


960
0:49:38,16 --> 0:49:41,4
[Welcome to the Machine]


961
0:49:41,4 --> 0:49:44,8
In society today, you seldom hear anyone speak


962
0:49:44,8 --> 0:49:47,44
of the progress of their country or society


963
0:49:47,44 --> 0:49:51,0
in terms of their physical well-being, state of happiness,


964
0:49:51,0 --> 0:49:53,64
trust or social stability.


965
0:49:53,64 --> 0:49:55,96
Rather, the measures are presented to us


966
0:49:55,96 --> 0:49:57,92
through economic abstractions.


967
0:49:57,92 --> 0:50:1,44
We have the gross domestic product, the consumer price index,


968
0:50:1,44 --> 0:50:4,24
the value of the stock market, rates of inflation...


969
0:50:4,24 --> 0:50:5,76
and so on.


970
0:50:5,76 --> 0:50:8,2
But does this tell us anything of real value


971
0:50:8,2 --> 0:50:11,2
as to the quality of people's lives?


972
0:50:11,2 --> 0:50:13,44
No. All of these measures have to do with


973
0:50:13,44 --> 0:50:17,0
the money sequence itself and nothing more.


974
0:50:17,0 --> 0:50:20,8
For example, the Gross Domestic Product of a country


975
0:50:20,8 --> 0:50:23,52
is a measure of the value of goods and services sold.


976
0:50:23,52 --> 0:50:26,4
This measure is claimed to correlate to the


977
0:50:26,4 --> 0:50:29,0
“standard of living” of a country's people.


978
0:50:29,0 --> 0:50:31,88
In the United States health care accounted for over


979
0:50:31,88 --> 0:50:34,96
17% of GDP in 2009


980
0:50:34,96 --> 0:50:38,4
amounting to over 2.5 trillion spent.


981
0:50:38,4 --> 0:50:41,8
Hence, creating a positive effect on this economic measure.


982
0:50:41,8 --> 0:50:43,24
And, based on this logic


983
0:50:43,24 --> 0:50:45,64
it would be even better for the US economy


984
0:50:45,64 --> 0:50:48,16
if health care services increased more so...


985
0:50:48,16 --> 0:50:51,0
perhaps to 3 trillion dollars... or 5 trillion


986
0:50:51,0 --> 0:50:52,92
since that would create more growth


987
0:50:52,92 --> 0:50:55,64
more jobs and hence boasted by economists


988
0:50:55,64 --> 0:50:59,4
as a rise in their country's standard of living.


989
0:50:59,4 --> 0:51:0,92
But wait a minute.


990
0:51:0,92 --> 0:51:4,12
What do health care services actually represent?


991
0:51:4,12 --> 0:51:7,44
Well, SICK AND DYING PEOPLE.


992
0:51:7,44 --> 0:51:11,12
That's right- the more unhealthy people there are in America


993
0:51:11,12 --> 0:51:13,16
the better the economy.


994
0:51:13,16 --> 0:51:17,16
Now, that is not an exaggeration or a cynical perspective.


995
0:51:17,16 --> 0:51:19,24
In fact, if we step back far enough


996
0:51:19,24 --> 0:51:21,12
you will realize that the GDP


997
0:51:21,12 --> 0:51:24,0
not only doesn't reflect real public or social health


998
0:51:24,0 --> 0:51:25,88
on any tangible level


999
0:51:25,88 --> 0:51:28,2
it is, in fact, mostly a measure


1000
0:51:28,2 --> 0:51:30,32
of industrial inefficiency


1001
0:51:30,32 --> 0:51:32,32
and social degradation.


1002
0:51:32,32 --> 0:51:35,8
And the more you see it rise, the worse things are becoming


1003
0:51:35,8 --> 0:51:38,36
with respect to personal, social


1004
0:51:38,36 --> 0:51:40,84
and environmental integrity.


1005
0:51:40,84 --> 0:51:44,8
You have to create problems to create profit.


1006
0:51:44,8 --> 0:51:47,88
There is no profit under the current paradigm


1007
0:51:47,88 --> 0:51:50,76
in saving lives, putting balance on this planet


1008
0:51:50,76 --> 0:51:53,16
having justice and peace or anything else.


1009
0:51:53,16 --> 0:51:56,44
There is just no profit there.


1010
0:51:56,44 --> 0:51:57,64
There's an old saying-


1011
0:51:57,64 --> 0:52:0,4
Pass a law and create a business'.


1012
0:52:0,4 --> 0:52:2,6
Whether you are creating a business for a lawyer or whatever.


1013
0:52:2,6 --> 0:52:4,92
So, crime does create


1014
0:52:4,92 --> 0:52:7,44
business just like destruction creates


1015
0:52:7,44 --> 0:52:8,88
business in Haiti.


1016
0:52:8,88 --> 0:52:12,2
We have now roughly 2,000,000 people incarcerated


1017
0:52:12,2 --> 0:52:13,52
in this country (USA)


1018
0:52:13,52 --> 0:52:16,12
and of those many are in prisons run


1019
0:52:16,12 --> 0:52:17,44
by private corporations:


1020
0:52:17,44 --> 0:52:19,4
Corrections Corporation of America, Wackenhut


1021
0:52:19,4 --> 0:52:21,16
who trade their stock on Wall Street


1022
0:52:21,16 --> 0:52:24,12
based upon how many people are in jail.


1023
0:52:24,12 --> 0:52:26,4
Now that's sickness.


1024
0:52:26,4 --> 0:52:28,12
But that is a reflection of what


1025
0:52:28,12 --> 0:52:32,0
this economic paradigm calls for.


1026
0:52:32,0 --> 0:52:35,84
So what exactly does this economic paradigm call for?


1027
0:52:35,84 --> 0:52:39,28
What is it that keeps our economic system going?


1028
0:52:39,28 --> 0:52:40,8
Consumption.


1029
0:52:40,8 --> 0:52:44,28
Or more accurately- Cyclical Consumption.


1030
0:52:44,28 --> 0:52:45,56
When we break down the


1031
0:52:45,56 --> 0:52:47,8
foundation of classic market economics


1032
0:52:47,8 --> 0:52:50,4
we are left with a pattern of monetary exchange


1033
0:52:50,4 --> 0:52:52,64
that simply cannot be allowed to stop


1034
0:52:52,64 --> 0:52:54,68
or even substantially slowed


1035
0:52:54,68 --> 0:52:56,24
if the society as we know it


1036
0:52:56,24 --> 0:52:58,36
is to remain operational.


1037
0:52:58,36 --> 0:53:1,2
There are three main actors on the economic stage:


1038
0:53:1,2 --> 0:53:3,2
the employee, the employer


1039
0:53:3,2 --> 0:53:4,56
and the consumer.


1040
0:53:4,56 --> 0:53:7,96
The employee sells labor to the employer for income.


1041
0:53:7,96 --> 0:53:11,0
The employer sells its production services, and hence goods,


1042
0:53:11,0 --> 0:53:13,4
to the consumer for income


1043
0:53:13,4 --> 0:53:15,64
and the consumer, of course, is simply another role


1044
0:53:15,64 --> 0:53:17,76
of the employer and employee


1045
0:53:17,76 --> 0:53:19,8
spending back into the system


1046
0:53:19,8 --> 0:53:22,88
to enable the cyclical consumption to continue.


1047
0:53:22,88 --> 0:53:25,28
In other words, the global market system is based on


1048
0:53:25,28 --> 0:53:27,6
the assumption that there will always be enough


1049
0:53:27,6 --> 0:53:29,76
product demand in a society


1050
0:53:29,76 --> 0:53:32,2
to move enough money around at a rate


1051
0:53:32,2 --> 0:53:35,12
which can keep the consumption process going.


1052
0:53:35,12 --> 0:53:36,88
And the faster the rate of consumption


1053
0:53:36,88 --> 0:53:39,48
the more so-called economic growth is assumed


1054
0:53:39,48 --> 0:53:42,12
and so the machine goes...


1055
0:53:42,12 --> 0:53:43,96
But, hold on-


1056
0:53:43,96 --> 0:53:46,84
I thought an economy was meant to, I don't know...


1057
0:53:46,84 --> 0:53:48,52
“Economize”?


1058
0:53:48,52 --> 0:53:51,24
Doesn't the very term have to do with preservation


1059
0:53:51,24 --> 0:53:54,8
and efficiency and a reduction of waste?


1060
0:53:54,8 --> 0:53:58,16
So how does our system, which demands consumption


1061
0:53:58,16 --> 0:54:0,68
and the more the better, efficiently preserve


1062
0:54:0,68 --> 0:54:3,0
or “Economize” at all?


1063
0:54:3,0 --> 0:54:5,12
Well... it doesn't.


1064
0:54:5,12 --> 0:54:8,96
The intent of the market system is, in fact, the exact opposite


1065
0:54:8,96 --> 0:54:11,32
of what a real economy is supposed to do,


1066
0:54:11,32 --> 0:54:13,88
which is efficiently and conservatively orient


1067
0:54:13,88 --> 0:54:15,96
the materials for production and distribution


1068
0:54:15,96 --> 0:54:18,24
of life supporting goods.


1069
0:54:18,24 --> 0:54:21,8
We live on a finite planet, with finite resources


1070
0:54:21,8 --> 0:54:23,36
where, for example, the oil we utilize took


1071
0:54:23,36 --> 0:54:25,44
millions of years to develop...


1072
0:54:25,44 --> 0:54:29,6
where the minerals we use took billions of years to develop.


1073
0:54:29,6 --> 0:54:32,92
So...having a system that deliberately promotes


1074
0:54:32,92 --> 0:54:35,8
the acceleration of consumption


1075
0:54:35,8 --> 0:54:38,28
for the sake of so-called “economic growth”


1076
0:54:38,28 --> 0:54:42,2
is pure ecocidal insanity.


1077
0:54:42,2 --> 0:54:45,2
Absence of waste, that's what efficiency is.


1078
0:54:45,2 --> 0:54:47,8
Absence of waste?


1079
0:54:47,8 --> 0:54:49,92
This system is more wasteful than all the other


1080
0:54:49,92 --> 0:54:52,84
existing systems in the history of the planet.


1081
0:54:52,84 --> 0:54:55,6
Every level of life organization and life system


1082
0:54:55,6 --> 0:54:58,8
is in a state of crisis and challenge


1083
0:54:58,8 --> 0:55:0,44
and decay or collapse.


1084
0:55:0,44 --> 0:55:3,44
No peer-reviewed journal in the last 30 years


1085
0:55:3,44 --> 0:55:5,52
will tell you anything different:


1086
0:55:5,52 --> 0:55:9,24
that is that every life system is in decline


1087
0:55:9,24 --> 0:55:11,36
as well as social programs...


1088
0:55:11,36 --> 0:55:13,64
as well as our water access.


1089
0:55:13,64 --> 0:55:15,52
Try to name any means of life that


1090
0:55:15,52 --> 0:55:17,4
isn't threatened and endangered...


1091
0:55:17,4 --> 0:55:18,56
You can't.


1092
0:55:18,56 --> 0:55:21,88
There really isn't one and that's very, very despairing.


1093
0:55:21,88 --> 0:55:24,76
But we haven't even figured out the causal mechanism.


1094
0:55:24,76 --> 0:55:26,88
We don't want to face the causal mechanism.


1095
0:55:26,88 --> 0:55:29,8
We just want to go on. You know that's where insanity is


1096
0:55:29,8 --> 0:55:32,12
where you keep doing the same thing over and over again


1097
0:55:32,12 --> 0:55:35,0
even though it clearly doesn't work.


1098
0:55:35,0 --> 0:55:37,6
So you're really


1099
0:55:37,6 --> 0:55:39,64
dealing with not an economic system


1100
0:55:39,64 --> 0:55:44,96
but I would go so far as to say an anti-economic system.


1101
0:55:44,96 --> 0:55:47,4
[The Anti-Economy]


1102
0:55:47,4 --> 0:55:49,48
There is an old saying that the competitive


1103
0:55:49,48 --> 0:55:51,44
market model seeks to


1104
0:55:51,44 --> 0:55:55,68
“create the best possible goods at the lowest possible prices”.


1105
0:55:55,68 --> 0:55:58,56
This statement is essentially the incentive concept


1106
0:55:58,56 --> 0:56:1,0
which justifies market competition


1107
0:56:1,0 --> 0:56:2,84
based on the assumption that the result


1108
0:56:2,84 --> 0:56:6,16
is the production of higher quality goods.


1109
0:56:6,16 --> 0:56:9,12
If I was going to build myself a table from scratch


1110
0:56:9,12 --> 0:56:11,48
I would naturally build it out of the best


1111
0:56:11,48 --> 0:56:13,44
most durable materials possible, right?


1112
0:56:13,44 --> 0:56:16,56
With the intent for it to last as long as possible.


1113
0:56:16,56 --> 0:56:18,6
Why would I want to make something poor


1114
0:56:18,6 --> 0:56:20,96
knowing I would have to eventually do it again


1115
0:56:20,96 --> 0:56:24,56
and expend more materials and more energy?


1116
0:56:24,56 --> 0:56:28,4
Well, as rational as that may seem in the physical world


1117
0:56:28,4 --> 0:56:29,84
when it comes to the market world


1118
0:56:29,84 --> 0:56:32,4
it is not only explicitly irrational


1119
0:56:32,4 --> 0:56:34,4
it is not even an option.


1120
0:56:34,4 --> 0:56:36,32
It is technically impossible to produce


1121
0:56:36,32 --> 0:56:37,68
the best of anything


1122
0:56:37,68 --> 0:56:40,52
if a company is to maintain a competitive edge


1123
0:56:40,52 --> 0:56:43,24
and hence remain affordable to the consumer.


1124
0:56:43,24 --> 0:56:45,92
Literally everything created and set for sale


1125
0:56:45,92 --> 0:56:48,96
in the global economy is immediately inferior


1126
0:56:48,96 --> 0:56:50,72
the moment it is produced


1127
0:56:50,72 --> 0:56:53,48
for it is a mathematical impossibility


1128
0:56:53,48 --> 0:56:56,4
to make the most scientifically advanced, efficient


1129
0:56:56,4 --> 0:56:59,12
and strategically sustainable products.


1130
0:56:59,12 --> 0:57:1,4
This is due to the fact that the market system


1131
0:57:1,4 --> 0:57:3,88
requires that “cost efficiency”


1132
0:57:3,88 --> 0:57:5,88
or the need to reduce expenses


1133
0:57:5,88 --> 0:57:8,28
exists at every stage of production.


1134
0:57:8,28 --> 0:57:10,48
From the cost of labor, to the cost


1135
0:57:10,48 --> 0:57:12,96
of materials and packaging and so on.


1136
0:57:12,96 --> 0:57:15,32
This competitive strategy, of course


1137
0:57:15,32 --> 0:57:18,28
is to make sure the public buys their goods


1138
0:57:18,28 --> 0:57:20,6
rather than from a competing producer


1139
0:57:20,6 --> 0:57:22,8
...which is doing the exact same thing


1140
0:57:22,8 --> 0:57:27,0
to also make their goods both competitive and affordable.


1141
0:57:27,0 --> 0:57:30,28
This immutably wasteful consequence of the system


1142
0:57:30,28 --> 0:57:34,12
could be termed: Intrinsic Obsolescence.


1143
0:57:34,12 --> 0:57:37,6
However, this is only one part of a larger problem:


1144
0:57:37,6 --> 0:57:40,64
A fundamental governing principle of market economics


1145
0:57:40,64 --> 0:57:43,84
one you will not find in any textbook, by the way


1146
0:57:43,84 --> 0:57:45,16
- is the following:


1147
0:57:45,16 --> 0:57:48,8
“Nothing produced can be allowed to maintain a lifespan


1148
0:57:48,8 --> 0:57:50,2
longer than what can be endured


1149
0:57:50,2 --> 0:57:53,76
in order to continue cyclical consumption.”


1150
0:57:53,76 --> 0:57:56,88
In other words, it is critical that stuff breakdown,


1151
0:57:56,88 --> 0:58:0,64
fail and expire within a certain amount of time.


1152
0:58:0,64 --> 0:58:4,0
This is termed - “Planned obsolescence”.


1153
0:58:4,0 --> 0:58:7,52
Planned obsolesce is the backbone of the underlying market


1154
0:58:7,52 --> 0:58:11,2
strategy of every goods producing corporation in existence.


1155
0:58:11,2 --> 0:58:12,64
While very few, of course


1156
0:58:12,64 --> 0:58:14,88
would admit to such a strategy outright


1157
0:58:14,88 --> 0:58:16,92
what they do is mask it within the


1158
0:58:16,92 --> 0:58:20,24
Intrinsic Obsolescence phenomenon just discussed,


1159
0:58:20,24 --> 0:58:22,76
while often ignoring, or even suppressing


1160
0:58:22,76 --> 0:58:24,56
new advents in technology


1161
0:58:24,56 --> 0:58:28,6
which might create a more sustainable, durable good.


1162
0:58:28,6 --> 0:58:30,76
So, if it wasn't wasteful enough


1163
0:58:30,76 --> 0:58:33,48
that the system inherently cannot allow the most


1164
0:58:33,48 --> 0:58:36,4
durable and efficient goods to be produced,


1165
0:58:36,4 --> 0:58:38,36
Planned Obsolescence deliberately


1166
0:58:38,36 --> 0:58:41,48
recognizes that the longer any good is in operation


1167
0:58:41,48 --> 0:58:44,76
the worse it is for sustaining cyclical consumption


1168
0:58:44,76 --> 0:58:47,68
and hence the market system itself.


1169
0:58:47,68 --> 0:58:50,16
In other words, product sustainability


1170
0:58:50,16 --> 0:58:53,72
is actually inverse to economic growth


1171
0:58:53,72 --> 0:58:57,16
and hence there is a direct, reinforced incentive


1172
0:58:57,16 --> 0:58:59,12
to make sure life spans are short


1173
0:58:59,12 --> 0:59:1,68
of any given good produced.


1174
0:59:1,68 --> 0:59:6,24
And, in fact, the system cannot operate any other way.


1175
0:59:6,24 --> 0:59:9,0
One glance at the sea of landfills now spreading across


1176
0:59:9,0 --> 0:59:12,6
the world show the obsolescence reality.


1177
0:59:12,6 --> 0:59:15,32
There are now billions of cheaply made cell phones


1178
0:59:15,32 --> 0:59:17,16
computers and other technology


1179
0:59:17,16 --> 0:59:20,4
each full of precious, difficult to mine materials


1180
0:59:20,4 --> 0:59:22,48
such as gold, coltan, copper...


1181
0:59:22,48 --> 0:59:24,68
now rotting in vast piles


1182
0:59:24,68 --> 0:59:27,44
usually due to the mere malfunction or obsolescence


1183
0:59:27,44 --> 0:59:31,36
of small parts which, in a conservative society


1184
0:59:31,36 --> 0:59:33,4
could likely be fixed or updated


1185
0:59:33,4 --> 0:59:35,68
and the life of the good extended.


1186
0:59:35,68 --> 0:59:38,2
Unfortunately, as efficient as that may seem


1187
0:59:38,2 --> 0:59:40,64
in our physical reality, living on a


1188
0:59:40,64 --> 0:59:43,8
finite planet with finite resources,


1189
0:59:43,8 --> 0:59:48,4
it is explicitly inefficient, with respect to the market.


1190
0:59:48,4 --> 0:59:49,44
To put into a phrase:


1191
0:59:49,44 --> 0:59:51,96
“Efficiency, Sustainability, and


1192
0:59:51,96 --> 0:59:56,28
Preservation are the enemies of our economic system” .


1193
0:59:56,28 --> 0:59:59,32
Likewise, just a physical goods need to be constantly


1194
0:59:59,32 --> 1:0:0,92
produced and reproduced


1195
1:0:0,92 --> 1:0:3,56
regardless of their environmental impact


1196
1:0:3,56 --> 1:0:7,64
the service industry operates with an equal rational.


1197
1:0:7,64 --> 1:0:10,28
The fact is, there is no monetary benefit


1198
1:0:10,28 --> 1:0:12,56
to resolving any problems


1199
1:0:12,56 --> 1:0:14,68
which are currently being serviced.


1200
1:0:14,68 --> 1:0:16,0
At the end of the day


1201
1:0:16,0 --> 1:0:19,4
the last thing the medical establishment really wants


1202
1:0:19,4 --> 1:0:22,4
is the curing of diseases such as cancer


1203
1:0:22,4 --> 1:0:27,16
which would eliminate countless jobs and trillions in revenue.


1204
1:0:27,16 --> 1:0:28,6
And since we are on the subject...


1205
1:0:28,6 --> 1:0:32,32
Crime and Terrorism in this system are good!


1206
1:0:32,32 --> 1:0:34,32
Well, at least economically...


1207
1:0:34,32 --> 1:0:36,4
for it is employing police


1208
1:0:36,4 --> 1:0:38,84
generating hi-value commodities for security


1209
1:0:38,84 --> 1:0:40,76
not to mention the value of prisons


1210
1:0:40,76 --> 1:0:43,92
that are privately owned - for profit.


1211
1:0:43,92 --> 1:0:45,52
And how about war?


1212
1:0:45,52 --> 1:0:49,44
The war industry in America is a huge driver of GDP -


1213
1:0:49,44 --> 1:0:51,84
one of the most profitable industries -


1214
1:0:51,84 --> 1:0:55,24
producing weapons of death and destruction.


1215
1:0:55,24 --> 1:0:58,44
The favorite game of this industry is to blow things up


1216
1:0:58,44 --> 1:1:1,8
and then can go and rebuild them, for profit.


1217
1:1:1,8 --> 1:1:3,64
We saw this with the windfall billion dollar


1218
1:1:3,64 --> 1:1:6,84
contracts made from the Iraq war.


1219
1:1:6,84 --> 1:1:9,12
The bottom line is that socially negative


1220
1:1:9,12 --> 1:1:10,76
attributes of society


1221
1:1:10,76 --> 1:1:14,16
have become positively rewarded ventures for industry


1222
1:1:14,16 --> 1:1:16,96
and any interest in problem resolution


1223
1:1:16,96 --> 1:1:20,4
or environmental sustainability and conservation


1224
1:1:20,4 --> 1:1:25,6
is intrinsically counter to economic sustainability.


1225
1:1:25,6 --> 1:1:27,28
And this is why


1226
1:1:27,28 --> 1:1:30,64
every time you see the GDP rise in any country


1227
1:1:30,64 --> 1:1:33,4
you are witnessing an increase in necessity


1228
1:1:33,4 --> 1:1:35,44
whether real or contrived


1229
1:1:35,44 --> 1:1:39,4
and by definition, a necessity is rooted in inefficiency.


1230
1:1:39,4 --> 1:1:44,84
Hence, increased necessity means increased inefficiency.


1231
1:1:44,84 --> 1:1:47,6
[Value System Disorder]


1232
1:1:47,6 --> 1:1:49,48
The American dream is based on


1233
1:1:49,48 --> 1:1:50,88
the rampant consumerism.


1234
1:1:50,88 --> 1:1:53,24
It is based upon the fact that


1235
1:1:53,24 --> 1:1:54,8
mainstream media and


1236
1:1:54,8 --> 1:1:56,88
especially commercial advertising


1237
1:1:56,88 --> 1:2:0,8
- all corporations who need this infinite growth -


1238
1:2:0,8 --> 1:2:2,64
have convinced us or brainwashed


1239
1:2:2,64 --> 1:2:6,0
most people in America and the world


1240
1:2:6,0 --> 1:2:8,96
that we have to have X number of material possessions


1241
1:2:8,96 --> 1:2:11,36
and the possibility of gaining infinitely more


1242
1:2:11,36 --> 1:2:14,4
material possessions, in order to be happy.


1243
1:2:14,4 --> 1:2:15,76
That's just not true.


1244
1:2:15,76 --> 1:2:19,6
So why do people continue to buy in this way


1245
1:2:19,6 --> 1:2:22,4
which is ultimately eco-genocidal


1246
1:2:22,4 --> 1:2:24,92
in its systemic effects cumulatively?


1247
1:2:24,92 --> 1:2:27,8
And it just is classical & operant conditioning.


1248
1:2:27,8 --> 1:2:32,2
You simply put inputs of conditioning into the organism


1249
1:2:32,2 --> 1:2:35,68
and you have outputs of desired behaviors


1250
1:2:35,68 --> 1:2:38,4
or goals or objectives.


1251
1:2:38,4 --> 1:2:41,28
And it has all the resources of technology


1252
1:2:41,28 --> 1:2:42,56
and they boast about how they


1253
1:2:42,56 --> 1:2:44,32
get into the minds of infants


1254
1:2:44,32 --> 1:2:47,48
what they hear is already making them


1255
1:2:47,48 --> 1:2:49,36
conditioned to the brand.


1256
1:2:49,36 --> 1:2:51,72
Then you see, that's how


1257
1:2:51,72 --> 1:2:52,96
people have been such fools.


1258
1:2:52,96 --> 1:2:55,28
They have been taught to be fools.


1259
1:2:55,28 --> 1:2:59,28
It's a value system disorder.


1260
1:2:59,28 --> 1:3:2,2
You know, if there is any testament to the plasticity


1261
1:3:2,2 --> 1:3:3,48
of the human mind.


1262
1:3:3,48 --> 1:3:5,56
If there is any proof to how malleable


1263
1:3:5,56 --> 1:3:7,56
human thought is and how easily


1264
1:3:7,56 --> 1:3:10,4
conditioned and guided people can become


1265
1:3:10,4 --> 1:3:12,68
based on the nature of their environmental stimulus


1266
1:3:12,68 --> 1:3:14,68
and what it reinforces:


1267
1:3:14,68 --> 1:3:18,4
the world of commercial advertising is the proof.


1268
1:3:18,4 --> 1:3:21,12
You have to stand in awe


1269
1:3:21,12 --> 1:3:23,52
at the level of brainwashing


1270
1:3:23,52 --> 1:3:27,56
where these programmed robots known as "consumers"


1271
1:3:27,56 --> 1:3:29,36
wander the landscape


1272
1:3:29,36 --> 1:3:32,76
only to walk into a store and spend, say


1273
1:3:32,76 --> 1:3:35,56
4000$ on a handbag


1274
1:3:35,56 --> 1:3:37,88
that likely cost 10 dollars to make


1275
1:3:37,88 --> 1:3:40,4
in a sweatshop overseas.


1276
1:3:40,4 --> 1:3:42,92
Only for the brand status it supposedly


1277
1:3:42,92 --> 1:3:45,8
represents in the culture.


1278
1:3:45,8 --> 1:3:48,48
Or perhaps the ancient communal traditions


1279
1:3:48,48 --> 1:3:52,4
which increase trust and cohesiveness in society -


1280
1:3:52,4 --> 1:3:54,56
which have now been hijacked by acquisitive


1281
1:3:54,56 --> 1:3:57,36
materialistic values where now we annually


1282
1:3:57,36 --> 1:4:1,24
exchange useless crap a few times a year.


1283
1:4:1,24 --> 1:4:3,56
And we might wonder why so many today have a


1284
1:4:3,56 --> 1:4:6,8
compulsion to shopping and acquisition


1285
1:4:6,8 --> 1:4:9,28
when it is clear that they have conditioned from childhood


1286
1:4:9,28 --> 1:4:11,16
to expect material goods


1287
1:4:11,16 --> 1:4:15,8
as a sign of their status with friends and family.


1288
1:4:15,8 --> 1:4:18,0
The fact is, the foundation of any society


1289
1:4:18,0 --> 1:4:20,32
are the values that support its operation


1290
1:4:20,32 --> 1:4:22,76
and our society, as it exists


1291
1:4:22,76 --> 1:4:25,44
can only operate if our values support


1292
1:4:25,44 --> 1:4:27,96
the conspicuous consumption it


1293
1:4:27,96 --> 1:4:31,4
requires to continue the market system.


1294
1:4:31,4 --> 1:4:34,44
75 years ago consumption in America


1295
1:4:34,44 --> 1:4:36,56
and much of the 1st world was half


1296
1:4:36,56 --> 1:4:38,6
of what we see today, per person.


1297
1:4:38,6 --> 1:4:40,72
Today's new consumer culture


1298
1:4:40,72 --> 1:4:43,16
has been manufactured and imposed


1299
1:4:43,16 --> 1:4:45,6
due to the very real need for higher


1300
1:4:45,6 --> 1:4:48,44
and higher levels of consumption.


1301
1:4:48,44 --> 1:4:51,52
And this is why most corporations now spend


1302
1:4:51,52 --> 1:4:55,12
more money on advertising, than the actual process


1303
1:4:55,12 --> 1:4:57,24
of product creation itself.


1304
1:4:57,24 --> 1:5:1,52
They work diligently to create a false need for you to fill.


1305
1:5:1,52 --> 1:5:5,4
And it happens to work.


1306
1:5:5,4 --> 1:5:7,72
[The “Economists”]


1307
1:5:7,72 --> 1:5:11,64
You know economists, in fact, are not economists at all.


1308
1:5:11,64 --> 1:5:13,96
They're propagandists of money value


1309
1:5:13,96 --> 1:5:16,8
and you will find that all of their


1310
1:5:16,8 --> 1:5:18,4
models basically get down to token


1311
1:5:18,4 --> 1:5:21,64
exchanges that are true to profit


1312
1:5:21,64 --> 1:5:23,92
of one side or both sides or whatever


1313
1:5:23,92 --> 1:5:26,28
but they are completely disconnected from the actually


1314
1:5:26,28 --> 1:5:28,44
existing world of reproduction.


1315
1:5:28,44 --> 1:5:32,48
In Ohio, an old man failed to pay his electric bill


1316
1:5:32,48 --> 1:5:34,72
you may be familiar with the case


1317
1:5:34,72 --> 1:5:38,24
and the electric company turned off the electricity and he died.


1318
1:5:38,24 --> 1:5:39,56
The reason they turned it off was


1319
1:5:39,56 --> 1:5:41,28
because it wouldn't have been profitable


1320
1:5:41,28 --> 1:5:44,56
for them to keep it on because he didn't pay his bill.


1321
1:5:44,56 --> 1:5:46,28
Do you believe that was right?


1322
1:5:46,28 --> 1:5:48,8
The responsibility really lies not on


1323
1:5:48,8 --> 1:5:50,56
the electric company for turning it off


1324
1:5:50,56 --> 1:5:53,84
but on those of this man's neighbors and friends


1325
1:5:53,84 --> 1:5:55,24
and associates


1326
1:5:55,24 --> 1:5:56,88
who were not charitable enough


1327
1:5:56,88 --> 1:5:58,84
to enable him, as an individual


1328
1:5:58,84 --> 1:6:1,0
to meet the electric bill.


1329
1:6:1,0 --> 1:6:2,68
HMMMMMM...


1330
1:6:2,68 --> 1:6:4,28
Did I hear that right?


1331
1:6:4,28 --> 1:6:6,2
Did he just say the death of a man


1332
1:6:6,2 --> 1:6:7,72
caused by not having money


1333
1:6:7,72 --> 1:6:9,44
was the responsibility of...


1334
1:6:9,44 --> 1:6:11,28
other people...


1335
1:6:11,28 --> 1:6:13,68
or, in effect, charity?


1336
1:6:13,68 --> 1:6:15,28
Well then, I guess we're gonna need


1337
1:6:15,28 --> 1:6:18,28
a whole lot of infomercials, little miserable


1338
1:6:18,28 --> 1:6:21,76
coin slot donations for bodega counters


1339
1:6:21,76 --> 1:6:23,6
and a bunch of pickle jars


1340
1:6:23,6 --> 1:6:26,4
for the billion people now starving to death


1341
1:6:26,4 --> 1:6:27,88
on this planet...


1342
1:6:27,88 --> 1:6:32,68
because of the very system Milton Friedman promotes.


1343
1:6:32,68 --> 1:6:35,0
Whether you are dealing with the philosophies of


1344
1:6:35,0 --> 1:6:36,84
Milton Friedman, F.A. Hyack


1345
1:6:36,84 --> 1:6:39,44
John Maynard Keynes, Ludwig von Mises


1346
1:6:39,44 --> 1:6:41,92
or any other major market economist


1347
1:6:41,92 --> 1:6:43,48
the basis of rationale


1348
1:6:43,48 --> 1:6:46,2
rarely leaves the money sequence.


1349
1:6:46,2 --> 1:6:47,72
It is like a religion.


1350
1:6:47,72 --> 1:6:50,44
Consumption analysis, stabilization policies


1351
1:6:50,44 --> 1:6:53,12
deficit spending, aggregate demand...


1352
1:6:53,12 --> 1:6:55,96
it exists as a never ending, self-referring


1353
1:6:55,96 --> 1:6:59,28
self-rationalizing circle of discourse


1354
1:6:59,28 --> 1:7:3,28
where universal human need, natural resources


1355
1:7:3,28 --> 1:7:6,72
and any form of physical life supporting efficiency


1356
1:7:6,72 --> 1:7:8,88
is ruled out by default


1357
1:7:8,88 --> 1:7:11,6
and replaced by the singular notion that humans


1358
1:7:11,6 --> 1:7:14,44
seeking advantage over each other for money alone


1359
1:7:14,44 --> 1:7:17,72
motivated by their own, narrow self-interest


1360
1:7:17,72 --> 1:7:22,16
will magically create a sustainable, healthy, balanced society.


1361
1:7:22,16 --> 1:7:25,36
There is no life coordinate in this whole theory


1362
1:7:25,36 --> 1:7:26,52
this whole doctrine.


1363
1:7:26,52 --> 1:7:28,4
What are they doing?


1364
1:7:28,4 --> 1:7:31,96
What they are doing is tracking the money sequences.


1365
1:7:31,96 --> 1:7:35,32
That's all it is, is tracking money sequences


1366
1:7:35,32 --> 1:7:38,64
presupposing everything that matters.


1367
1:7:38,64 --> 1:7:41,24
One: There is no life coordinates...


1368
1:7:41,24 --> 1:7:43,48
whoa... no life coordinates!


1369
1:7:43,48 --> 1:7:45,8
Two: That all the agents are


1370
1:7:45,8 --> 1:7:49,4
self-maximizing preferences seekers.


1371
1:7:49,4 --> 1:7:51,36
That is, they think of nothing other than themselves


1372
1:7:51,36 --> 1:7:53,36
and what they can get most for themselves.


1373
1:7:53,36 --> 1:7:57,48
That's the ruling notion of rationality:


1374
1:7:57,48 --> 1:7:59,52
self-maximizing choice


1375
1:7:59,52 --> 1:8:3,0
and the only thing that they are interested in self-maximizing


1376
1:8:3,0 --> 1:8:5,32
is money or commodities.


1377
1:8:5,32 --> 1:8:7,72
Well, where does social relations come in?


1378
1:8:7,72 --> 1:8:11,24
It doesn't, except in the exchange to self-maximize.


1379
1:8:11,24 --> 1:8:13,76
Where do our natural resources come in?


1380
1:8:13,76 --> 1:8:16,84
They don't, except to exploit.


1381
1:8:16,84 --> 1:8:21,56
Where does the family come in as being able to survive?


1382
1:8:21,56 --> 1:8:23,84
It doesn't. They have to have


1383
1:8:23,84 --> 1:8:26,76
money in order to purchase any good.


1384
1:8:26,76 --> 1:8:28,24
Well, shouldn't an economy


1385
1:8:28,24 --> 1:8:29,96
deal somewhere with human need?


1386
1:8:29,96 --> 1:8:35,2
Isn't that what the fundamental issue is?


1387
1:8:35,2 --> 1:8:38,24
Oh, "need" isn't even in your lexicon.


1388
1:8:38,24 --> 1:8:41,44
You dissolve it into "wants"...


1389
1:8:41,44 --> 1:8:43,4
and what is a want? That means


1390
1:8:43,4 --> 1:8:45,8
money demand that wants to buy.


1391
1:8:45,8 --> 1:8:48,4
Well, if it's money demand that wants to buy


1392
1:8:48,4 --> 1:8:49,92
it has nothing to do with need


1393
1:8:49,92 --> 1:8:52,8
because maybe the person has no money demand


1394
1:8:52,8 --> 1:8:55,2
and desperately needs, say, water supply.


1395
1:8:55,2 --> 1:8:58,92
Or, it may be money demand wants a gold toilet seat.


1396
1:8:58,92 --> 1:9:0,52
Well, where does it all go?


1397
1:9:0,52 --> 1:9:2,24
To the gold toilet seat.


1398
1:9:2,24 --> 1:9:4,0
And you call this economics?


1399
1:9:4,0 --> 1:9:6,56
Really, when one thinks of it


1400
1:9:6,56 --> 1:9:9,72
it's got to be the most bizarre


1401
1:9:9,72 --> 1:9:14,4
delusion in the history of human thought.


1402
1:9:14,4 --> 1:9:16,28
[Monetary System]


1403
1:9:16,28 --> 1:9:20,4
Now- so far we have focused on the market system.


1404
1:9:20,4 --> 1:9:22,32
But this system is actually only


1405
1:9:22,32 --> 1:9:24,92
half of the global economic paradigm.


1406
1:9:24,92 --> 1:9:28,28
The other half is the “Monetary System”.


1407
1:9:28,28 --> 1:9:31,44
While the Market System deals with the interaction of people


1408
1:9:31,44 --> 1:9:34,48
gaming for profit across the spectrum of labor


1409
1:9:34,48 --> 1:9:36,44
production and distribution


1410
1:9:36,44 --> 1:9:39,92
the Monetary System is an underlying set of policies


1411
1:9:39,92 --> 1:9:41,88
set by financial institutions


1412
1:9:41,88 --> 1:9:43,84
which create conditions for the


1413
1:9:43,84 --> 1:9:46,8
market system, among other things.


1414
1:9:46,8 --> 1:9:48,88
It includes terms we often hear


1415
1:9:48,88 --> 1:9:52,0
such as interest rates, loans, debt, the money supply


1416
1:9:52,0 --> 1:9:54,76
inflation, etc.


1417
1:9:54,76 --> 1:9:57,4
And while you might want to pull your hair out listening


1418
1:9:57,4 --> 1:9:59,96
to the gibberish coming from the monetary economists:


1419
1:9:59,96 --> 1:10:4,12
"Modest preemptive actions, can obviate the need


1420
1:10:4,12 --> 1:10:7,96
of more drastic actions, at a later date."


1421
1:10:7,96 --> 1:10:10,12
the nature and effect of this


1422
1:10:10,12 --> 1:10:12,52
system is actually quite simple:


1423
1:10:12,52 --> 1:10:14,2
Our economy has...


1424
1:10:14,2 --> 1:10:16,28
or the global economy has


1425
1:10:16,28 --> 1:10:17,84
three basic things that govern it.


1426
1:10:17,84 --> 1:10:19,4
One is fractional reserve banking


1427
1:10:19,4 --> 1:10:21,88
the banks printing money out of nothing.


1428
1:10:21,88 --> 1:10:24,32
It's also based upon compound interest.


1429
1:10:24,32 --> 1:10:27,32
When you borrow money, you have to pay back more


1430
1:10:27,32 --> 1:10:29,96
than you borrowed, which means that you, in effect


1431
1:10:29,96 --> 1:10:32,76
create money out of thin air


1432
1:10:32,76 --> 1:10:36,76
again, which has to be serviced by creating still more money.


1433
1:10:36,76 --> 1:10:39,0
We live in an infinite growth paradigm.


1434
1:10:39,0 --> 1:10:42,76
The economic paradigm we live in now is a Ponzi scheme.


1435
1:10:42,76 --> 1:10:45,56
Nothing grows forever.


1436
1:10:45,56 --> 1:10:46,68
It's not possible.


1437
1:10:46,68 --> 1:10:49,4
As a great psychologist James Hillman wrote


1438
1:10:49,4 --> 1:10:51,32
“The only thing that grows in the human body after


1439
1:10:51,32 --> 1:10:53,56
a certain age is cancer.”


1440
1:10:53,56 --> 1:10:56,8
It's not just the amount of money that has to keep growing


1441
1:10:56,8 --> 1:10:57,48
it's the amount of consumers.


1442
1:10:57,48 --> 1:10:59,6
Consumers to borrow money at interest


1443
1:10:59,6 --> 1:11:2,76
to generate more money and obviously, that's not possible


1444
1:11:2,76 --> 1:11:4,64
on a finite planet.


1445
1:11:4,64 --> 1:11:8,4
People are basically vehicles to just create money


1446
1:11:8,4 --> 1:11:10,32
which must create more money


1447
1:11:10,32 --> 1:11:12,2
to keep the whole thing from falling apart


1448
1:11:12,2 --> 1:11:15,2
which is what's happening right now.


1449
1:11:15,2 --> 1:11:17,88
There are really only two things anyone needs to know


1450
1:11:17,88 --> 1:11:20,24
about the monetary system:


1451
1:11:20,24 --> 1:11:23,48
1: All money is created out of debt.


1452
1:11:23,48 --> 1:11:25,72
Money is monetized debt


1453
1:11:25,72 --> 1:11:28,24
whether it materialized from treasury bonds


1454
1:11:28,24 --> 1:11:31,12
home loan contracts or credit cards.


1455
1:11:31,12 --> 1:11:33,28
In other words, if all outstanding debt


1456
1:11:33,28 --> 1:11:35,28
was to be repaid right now


1457
1:11:35,28 --> 1:11:38,64
there would not be one dollar in circulation.


1458
1:11:38,64 --> 1:11:43,72
And 2: Interest is charged on virtually all loans made


1459
1:11:43,72 --> 1:11:46,24
and the money needed to pay back this interest


1460
1:11:46,24 --> 1:11:49,4
does not exist in the money supply outright.


1461
1:11:49,4 --> 1:11:52,12
Only the principal is created by the loans


1462
1:11:52,12 --> 1:11:54,8
and the principal is the money supply.


1463
1:11:54,8 --> 1:11:57,68
So, if all this debt was to be repaid right now


1464
1:11:57,68 --> 1:12:0,88
not only would there not be one dollar left in circulation


1465
1:12:0,88 --> 1:12:4,52
there would be a gigantic amount of money owed


1466
1:12:4,52 --> 1:12:10,64
that is literally impossible to pay back, for it does not exist.


1467
1:12:10,64 --> 1:12:14,84
The consequence of all of this is that two things are inevitable:


1468
1:12:14,84 --> 1:12:16,4
Inflation


1469
1:12:16,4 --> 1:12:18,12
and Bankruptcy.


1470
1:12:18,12 --> 1:12:21,64
As far as inflation, this can be seen as a historical trend


1471
1:12:21,64 --> 1:12:23,48
in virtually every country today


1472
1:12:23,48 --> 1:12:25,36
and easily tied to its cause


1473
1:12:25,36 --> 1:12:28,52
which is the perpetual increase of the money supply


1474
1:12:28,52 --> 1:12:29,72
which is required


1475
1:12:29,72 --> 1:12:34,24
to cover the interest charges and keep the system going.


1476
1:12:34,24 --> 1:12:35,68
As far as Bankruptcy


1477
1:12:35,68 --> 1:12:39,24
it comes in the form of debt collapse.


1478
1:12:39,24 --> 1:12:42,24
This collapse will inevitably occur with a person


1479
1:12:42,24 --> 1:12:44,16
a business or a country


1480
1:12:44,16 --> 1:12:46,8
and typically happens when the interest payments


1481
1:12:46,8 --> 1:12:50,28
are no longer possible to make.


1482
1:12:50,28 --> 1:12:52,24
But there is a bright side to all of this...


1483
1:12:52,24 --> 1:12:56,0
well, at least in terms of the market system


1484
1:12:56,0 --> 1:12:58,96
Because debt creates pressure


1485
1:12:58,96 --> 1:13:1,28
Debt creates wage slaves.


1486
1:13:1,28 --> 1:13:4,12
A person in debt is much more likely to take a low wage


1487
1:13:4,12 --> 1:13:5,64
than a person who isn't


1488
1:13:5,64 --> 1:13:8,28
hence becoming a cheap commodity


1489
1:13:8,28 --> 1:13:10,68
so it's great for corporations to have a pool of people


1490
1:13:10,68 --> 1:13:13,92
that have no financial mobility.


1491
1:13:13,92 --> 1:13:18,4
But hey - that same idea also goes for entire countries...


1492
1:13:18,4 --> 1:13:21,0
the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund


1493
1:13:21,0 --> 1:13:23,24
which mostly serve as proxies for


1494
1:13:23,24 --> 1:13:25,52
transnational corporate interests


1495
1:13:25,52 --> 1:13:28,0
give gigantic loans to troubled countries


1496
1:13:28,0 --> 1:13:29,88
at very high interest rates


1497
1:13:29,88 --> 1:13:31,88
and then, once the countries are


1498
1:13:31,88 --> 1:13:33,92
deeply in the hole and can't pay


1499
1:13:33,92 --> 1:13:35,8
austerity measures are applied


1500
1:13:35,8 --> 1:13:37,56
the corporations swoop in


1501
1:13:37,56 --> 1:13:41,48
set up sweatshops and take their natural resources.


1502
1:13:41,48 --> 1:13:45,0
Now that's market efficiency.


1503
1:13:45,0 --> 1:13:46,88
But wait – there's more:


1504
1:13:46,88 --> 1:13:48,44
you see- there's this unique


1505
1:13:48,44 --> 1:13:50,8
hybrid of the monetary and market system


1506
1:13:50,8 --> 1:13:52,72
called the stock market


1507
1:13:52,72 --> 1:13:56,32
which rather than, you know, actually produce anything real


1508
1:13:56,32 --> 1:13:59,72
they just buy and sell money itself.


1509
1:13:59,72 --> 1:14:2,36
And when it comes to debt, you know what they do?


1510
1:14:2,36 --> 1:14:5,4
That's right - they trade it.


1511
1:14:5,4 --> 1:14:9,4
They actually buy and sell debt for profit.


1512
1:14:9,4 --> 1:14:10,8
From credit default swaps


1513
1:14:10,8 --> 1:14:14,12
and collateralized debt obligations for consumer debt


1514
1:14:14,12 --> 1:14:16,44
to complex derivative schemes used


1515
1:14:16,44 --> 1:14:19,4
to mask the debt of entire countries


1516
1:14:19,4 --> 1:14:20,12
such as the collusion of


1517
1:14:20,12 --> 1:14:22,88
investment bank Goldman Sachs and Greece


1518
1:14:22,88 --> 1:14:26,48
which nearly collapsed the entire European economy.


1519
1:14:26,48 --> 1:14:29,4
So when it comes to the stock market and Wall Street


1520
1:14:29,4 --> 1:14:32,44
we have an entirely new level of insanity


1521
1:14:32,44 --> 1:14:35,72
born out of the Money Sequence of value.


1522
1:14:35,72 --> 1:14:37,36
All you need to know about markets


1523
1:14:37,36 --> 1:14:40,56
was written in an editorial in the Wall Street Journal


1524
1:14:40,56 --> 1:14:41,72
a couple years ago


1525
1:14:41,72 --> 1:14:45,24
it was called 'Lessons of the Brain-Damaged Investor".


1526
1:14:45,24 --> 1:14:48,28
And in this editorial, they explained why


1527
1:14:48,28 --> 1:14:50,8
people with slight brain damage


1528
1:14:50,8 --> 1:14:52,8
do better as investors


1529
1:14:52,8 --> 1:14:54,8
than people with normal brain functionality.


1530
1:14:54,8 --> 1:14:56,68
Why? Because the slightly


1531
1:14:56,68 --> 1:14:59,24
brain-damaged person has no empathy.


1532
1:14:59,24 --> 1:15:2,2
That's the key. If you don't have any empathy


1533
1:15:2,2 --> 1:15:4,2
you do well as an investor


1534
1:15:4,2 --> 1:15:9,12
and so Wall Street breeds people who have no empathy.


1535
1:15:9,12 --> 1:15:11,48
To go in there and to make decisions


1536
1:15:11,48 --> 1:15:14,4
and to make trades they have no compunction about


1537
1:15:14,4 --> 1:15:17,16
no thought whatsoever as to how what they are doing


1538
1:15:17,16 --> 1:15:19,12
might affect their fellow human being.


1539
1:15:19,12 --> 1:15:21,48
So they breed these robots.


1540
1:15:21,48 --> 1:15:24,4
These people who have no souls


1541
1:15:24,4 --> 1:15:27,12
and since they don't even want to pay these people anymore-


1542
1:15:27,12 --> 1:15:29,32
they are now breeding robots – real robots –


1543
1:15:29,32 --> 1:15:31,12
real algorithmic traders.


1544
1:15:31,12 --> 1:15:33,72
Goldman Sachs in the high frequency trading scandal:


1545
1:15:33,72 --> 1:15:37,52
they put a computer next to the New York Stock Exchange.


1546
1:15:37,52 --> 1:15:40,56
This computer, this “co-located” computer, as they call it:


1547
1:15:40,56 --> 1:15:42,96
it front-runs all the trades on the exchange and


1548
1:15:42,96 --> 1:15:45,88
hits the exchange with volumes of orders


1549
1:15:45,88 --> 1:15:47,4
in ways that "scalp"


1550
1:15:47,4 --> 1:15:49,52
pennies and nickels away from the exchange.


1551
1:15:49,52 --> 1:15:52,4
It's like they're siphoning money all day long.


1552
1:15:52,4 --> 1:15:54,76
They went one quarter last year 30


1553
1:15:54,76 --> 1:15:57,72
or 60 straight days without a single down day


1554
1:15:57,72 --> 1:16:0,24
and made millions of dollars every single day?


1555
1:16:0,24 --> 1:16:4,2
That statistically impossible!


1556
1:16:4,2 --> 1:16:6,12
When I worked on Wall Street, the way it works is


1557
1:16:6,12 --> 1:16:8,4
everyone kicks upstairs to bribes.


1558
1:16:8,4 --> 1:16:11,92
The brokers bribe to the office manager


1559
1:16:11,92 --> 1:16:15,32
the office manager bribes to the regional sales manager.


1560
1:16:15,32 --> 1:16:16,84
The regional sales manager


1561
1:16:16,84 --> 1:16:18,92
bribes to the national sales manager.


1562
1:16:18,92 --> 1:16:20,48
It's a common understanding.


1563
1:16:20,48 --> 1:16:23,56
At Christmas, who gets the biggest bonus at Christmas


1564
1:16:23,56 --> 1:16:26,44
in an average broker job? The compliance officer.


1565
1:16:26,44 --> 1:16:28,76
The compliance officer sits there all day long;


1566
1:16:28,76 --> 1:16:30,28
he's supposed to be making sure you


1567
1:16:30,28 --> 1:16:31,96
don't violate any of the margin rules


1568
1:16:31,96 --> 1:16:34,8
and you're "complying" with the law.


1569
1:16:34,8 --> 1:16:36,48
Of course, yeah, to the extent that


1570
1:16:36,48 --> 1:16:38,4
you can bribe the compliance officer


1571
1:16:38,4 --> 1:16:40,88
yeah, that's right, you are complying with the law!


1572
1:16:40,88 --> 1:16:43,28
So how has fraud become the system?


1573
1:16:43,28 --> 1:16:44,96
It's no longer a byproduct.


1574
1:16:44,96 --> 1:16:46,36
It is the system.


1575
1:16:46,36 --> 1:16:49,16
It's like that old Woody Allen joke. He says:


1576
1:16:49,16 --> 1:16:51,72
“Doctor, my brother thinks he's a chicken.”


1577
1:16:51,72 --> 1:16:53,64
And the doctor says, “Take a pill


1578
1:16:53,64 --> 1:16:55,56
and that should cure the problem.”


1579
1:16:55,56 --> 1:16:57,28
And he says, “No doctor. You don't understand


1580
1:16:57,28 --> 1:16:59,0
We need the eggs.”


1581
1:16:59,0 --> 1:17:0,92
Okay?


1582
1:17:0,92 --> 1:17:3,32
So, the trading of fraudulent claims back and forth


1583
1:17:3,32 --> 1:17:5,4
between banks


1584
1:17:5,4 --> 1:17:6,36
to generate fees


1585
1:17:6,36 --> 1:17:7,48
to generate bonuses


1586
1:17:7,48 --> 1:17:11,2
has become the GDP producing growth


1587
1:17:11,2 --> 1:17:14,16
engine of the United States economy


1588
1:17:14,16 --> 1:17:17,2
even though they are essentially trading fraudulent claims


1589
1:17:17,2 --> 1:17:19,72
that there is absolutely no hope of ever paying back.


1590
1:17:19,72 --> 1:17:22,92
They are processing, generating and re-securitizing nothing.


1591
1:17:22,92 --> 1:17:25,76
If I write $20 billion on a cocktail napkin


1592
1:17:25,76 --> 1:17:28,6
and I sell it to J.P. Morgan and J.P. Morgan writes


1593
1:17:28,6 --> 1:17:31,52
$20 billion on a cocktail napkin


1594
1:17:31,52 --> 1:17:34,12
and we swap those two cocktail napkins at a bar


1595
1:17:34,12 --> 1:17:37,76
and we each pay ourselves a quarter of 1% in a fee


1596
1:17:37,76 --> 1:17:39,88
we make a lot of money for our Christmas bonus.


1597
1:17:39,88 --> 1:17:43,4
We each have on our books a $20 billion cocktail napkin


1598
1:17:43,4 --> 1:17:47,16
which has no real value until such time as


1599
1:17:47,16 --> 1:17:50,12
the system is no longer able to absorb bogus


1600
1:17:50,12 --> 1:17:52,8
cocktail napkins in which case we go to the government


1601
1:17:52,8 --> 1:17:55,0
to get bailed out.


1602
1:17:55,0 --> 1:17:57,76
And because of Wall street and the global stock market


1603
1:17:57,76 --> 1:18:1,32
there are now conservatively about 700 Trillion dollars


1604
1:18:1,32 --> 1:18:3,88
of outstanding fraudulent claims-


1605
1:18:3,88 --> 1:18:5,64
know as derivatives


1606
1:18:5,64 --> 1:18:7,96
still waiting to collapse.


1607
1:18:7,96 --> 1:18:9,68
A value amounting to over 10


1608
1:18:9,68 --> 1:18:11,72
times the gross domestic product


1609
1:18:11,72 --> 1:18:14,16
of the entire planet.


1610
1:18:14,16 --> 1:18:16,8
And while we have seen the bailouts of


1611
1:18:16,8 --> 1:18:18,68
corporations and banks by governments...


1612
1:18:18,68 --> 1:18:20,52
which, of course, comically borrow


1613
1:18:20,52 --> 1:18:22,72
their money from banks to begin with.


1614
1:18:22,72 --> 1:18:25,68
We are now seeing attempts to bailout whole countries


1615
1:18:25,68 --> 1:18:27,96
by conglomerates of other countries


1616
1:18:27,96 --> 1:18:30,72
through the International banks.


1617
1:18:30,72 --> 1:18:34,2
But how do you bailout a planet?


1618
1:18:34,2 --> 1:18:38,6
There is no country out there that isn't now saturated in debt.


1619
1:18:38,6 --> 1:18:41,64
The cascade of sovereign debt defaults we have seen


1620
1:18:41,64 --> 1:18:46,16
can only be the beginning, when the math is taken into account.


1621
1:18:46,16 --> 1:18:49,28
It has been estimated in the United States alone


1622
1:18:49,28 --> 1:18:52,96
that income tax would need to be raised to 65%


1623
1:18:52,96 --> 1:18:57,44
per person just to cover the interest in the near future.


1624
1:18:57,44 --> 1:19:0,56
Economists are now foreshadowing that within a few decades


1625
1:19:0,56 --> 1:19:5,96
60% of the countries on the planet will be bankrupt.


1626
1:19:5,96 --> 1:19:9,32
But hold on-- Let me get this straight.


1627
1:19:9,32 --> 1:19:12,12
The world is going bankrupt


1628
1:19:12,12 --> 1:19:13,72
whatever the hell that means


1629
1:19:13,72 --> 1:19:16,16
because of this idea called "debt"


1630
1:19:16,16 --> 1:19:19,52
which doesn't even exist in the physical reality.


1631
1:19:19,52 --> 1:19:22,4
It's only part of a game we've invented...


1632
1:19:22,4 --> 1:19:25,68
and yet the well being of billions of people


1633
1:19:25,68 --> 1:19:27,92
is now being compromised.


1634
1:19:27,92 --> 1:19:32,48
Extreme layoffs - tent cities- accelerating poverty


1635
1:19:32,48 --> 1:19:35,88
Austerity measures imposed - schools shutting down -


1636
1:19:35,88 --> 1:19:40,2
child hunger...and other levels of familial deprivation


1637
1:19:40,2 --> 1:19:44,16
all because of this elaborate fiction...


1638
1:19:44,16 --> 1:19:48,92
What are we, fucking stupid?!


1639
1:19:48,92 --> 1:19:50,8
Hey! Hey! Mars- my man.


1640
1:19:50,8 --> 1:19:54,88
Help a brother out, uh?


1641
1:19:54,88 --> 1:20:4,32
Grow up, kid.


1642
1:20:4,32 --> 1:20:6,6
Saturn! What's up man?


1643
1:20:6,6 --> 1:20:8,92
You remember that smokin' nebula I hooked you up with


1644
1:20:8,92 --> 1:20:12,8
a while back?


1645
1:20:12,8 --> 1:20:13,44
uh- listen Earth.


1646
1:20:13,44 --> 1:20:15,8
We're getting really tired of you.


1647
1:20:15,8 --> 1:20:18,6
You've been given everything and yet you waste it all.


1648
1:20:18,6 --> 1:20:21,32
You've got plenty of resources and you know it.


1649
1:20:21,32 --> 1:20:22,8
Why don't you grow up and learn


1650
1:20:22,8 --> 1:20:24,96
some responsibility for Christ's sake.


1651
1:20:24,96 --> 1:20:32,68
You're making your mother miserable.


1652
1:20:32,68 --> 1:20:34,52
You're on your own, pal.


1653
1:20:34,52 --> 1:20:42,96
Yeah, whatever.


1654
1:20:42,96 --> 1:20:45,56
[Public Health]


1655
1:20:45,56 --> 1:20:47,8
Now, all of this considered...


1656
1:20:47,8 --> 1:20:50,6
from the waste machine known as the market system-


1657
1:20:50,6 --> 1:20:53,84
to the debt machine known as the monetary system-


1658
1:20:53,84 --> 1:20:57,48
hence creating the monetary-market paradigm


1659
1:20:57,48 --> 1:21:0,48
which defines the global economy today...


1660
1:21:0,48 --> 1:21:3,4
there is one consequence that runs through


1661
1:21:3,4 --> 1:21:5,56
the entire machine:


1662
1:21:5,56 --> 1:21:7,92
Inequality.


1663
1:21:7,92 --> 1:21:10,64
Whether it is market system which creates a natural


1664
1:21:10,64 --> 1:21:14,72
gravitation towards monopoly and power consolidation


1665
1:21:14,72 --> 1:21:17,92
while also generating pockets of wealthy industries


1666
1:21:17,92 --> 1:21:20,12
that tower over others


1667
1:21:20,12 --> 1:21:22,16
regardless of utility-


1668
1:21:22,16 --> 1:21:23,56
such as the fact that top


1669
1:21:23,56 --> 1:21:25,44
hedge fund managers on wall street


1670
1:21:25,44 --> 1:21:29,0
now take home over 300 million dollars a year


1671
1:21:29,0 --> 1:21:31,96
for contributing literally nothing.


1672
1:21:31,96 --> 1:21:35,24
While a scientist looking for a cure for a disease


1673
1:21:35,24 --> 1:21:37,2
trying to help humanity


1674
1:21:37,2 --> 1:21:41,24
might make 60 thousand dollars a year if they're lucky.


1675
1:21:41,24 --> 1:21:43,72
Or whether it is the monetary system


1676
1:21:43,72 --> 1:21:47,48
which has class division built right into its structure.


1677
1:21:47,48 --> 1:21:48,56
For example:


1678
1:21:48,56 --> 1:21:52,16
If I have 1 million dollars to spare and I put it into a CD


1679
1:21:52,16 --> 1:21:53,76
at 4% interest-


1680
1:21:53,76 --> 1:21:55,88
I will make 40,000 dollars a year.


1681
1:21:55,88 --> 1:21:59,16
No social contribution- no nothing.


1682
1:21:59,16 --> 1:22:2,8
However, if I'm a lower class person and have to take loans


1683
1:22:2,8 --> 1:22:4,4
to buy my car or home


1684
1:22:4,4 --> 1:22:6,32
I am paying in interest which


1685
1:22:6,32 --> 1:22:7,52
in abstraction


1686
1:22:7,52 --> 1:22:11,88
is going to pay that millionaire with the 4% CD.


1687
1:22:11,88 --> 1:22:14,6
This stealing from the poor to pay the rich


1688
1:22:14,6 --> 1:22:18,92
is a foundational, built in aspect of the monetary system.


1689
1:22:18,92 --> 1:22:23,36
And it could be labeled “Structural Classism”.


1690
1:22:23,36 --> 1:22:26,12
Of course, historically, social stratification


1691
1:22:26,12 --> 1:22:28,48
has always been deemed unfair


1692
1:22:28,48 --> 1:22:30,32
but obviously accepted overall


1693
1:22:30,32 --> 1:22:35,64
as now 1% of the population owns 40% of the planet's wealth.


1694
1:22:35,64 --> 1:22:38,8
But material fairness aside


1695
1:22:38,8 --> 1:22:39,84
there is something else going on


1696
1:22:39,84 --> 1:22:41,96
underneath the surface of inequality


1697
1:22:41,96 --> 1:22:46,72
causing an incredible deterioration in public health as a whole.


1698
1:22:46,72 --> 1:22:50,16
Well, I think people often are puzzled by the contrast


1699
1:22:50,16 --> 1:22:53,4
between the material success of our societies


1700
1:22:53,4 --> 1:22:55,56
- unprecedented levels of wealth -


1701
1:22:55,56 --> 1:22:58,96
and the many social failings.


1702
1:22:58,96 --> 1:23:2,12
If you look at the rates of


1703
1:23:2,12 --> 1:23:4,92
drug abuse or violence or self harm


1704
1:23:4,92 --> 1:23:7,76
amongst kids or mental illness


1705
1:23:7,76 --> 1:23:11,4
there is clearly something going deeply wrong


1706
1:23:11,4 --> 1:23:12,64
with our societies.


1707
1:23:12,64 --> 1:23:16,28
The data I have been describing


1708
1:23:16,28 --> 1:23:20,12
simply shows that intuition that people


1709
1:23:20,12 --> 1:23:23,36
have had for hundreds of years, that inequality is divisive


1710
1:23:23,36 --> 1:23:24,96
and socially corrosive.


1711
1:23:24,96 --> 1:23:28,92
But, that intuition is truer than I think we ever imagined.


1712
1:23:28,92 --> 1:23:32,32
There are very powerful psychological and social effects


1713
1:23:32,32 --> 1:23:35,8
of inequality. More to do I suppose with feelings


1714
1:23:35,8 --> 1:23:38,44
of superiority and inferiority.


1715
1:23:38,44 --> 1:23:40,36
That kind of division...


1716
1:23:40,36 --> 1:23:43,68
Maybe going with the respect or disrespect


1717
1:23:43,68 --> 1:23:46,28
- people feeling looked down on at the bottom


1718
1:23:46,28 --> 1:23:48,16
which, by the way, is why violence is


1719
1:23:48,16 --> 1:23:50,84
more common in more unequal societies -


1720
1:23:50,84 --> 1:23:54,4
the trigger to violence is so often people feeling looked down


1721
1:23:54,4 --> 1:23:55,92
upon and disrespected.


1722
1:23:55,92 --> 1:23:59,92
If there is one principle I could emphasize


1723
1:23:59,92 --> 1:24:4,44
that is, the most important principle underlying


1724
1:24:4,44 --> 1:24:7,2
the prevention of violence


1725
1:24:7,2 --> 1:24:10,28
it would be “Equality”.


1726
1:24:10,28 --> 1:24:11,96
The single most significant factor


1727
1:24:11,96 --> 1:24:13,72
that affects the rate of violence


1728
1:24:13,72 --> 1:24:17,52
is the degree of equality versus the degree of inequality


1729
1:24:17,52 --> 1:24:20,6
in that society.


1730
1:24:20,6 --> 1:24:22,92
So, what we're looking at is a sort of


1731
1:24:22,92 --> 1:24:25,0
general social dysfunction.


1732
1:24:25,0 --> 1:24:27,6
It's not just one or two things that go wrong


1733
1:24:27,6 --> 1:24:29,68
as inequality increases


1734
1:24:29,68 --> 1:24:31,92
it seems to be everything, whether we are talking about


1735
1:24:31,92 --> 1:24:34,96
crime or health or mental illness or whatever.


1736
1:24:34,96 --> 1:24:38,8
One of the really disturbing findings out there in public health


1737
1:24:38,8 --> 1:24:43,12
is never ever make the mistake of being poor.


1738
1:24:43,12 --> 1:24:44,8
Or being born poor.


1739
1:24:44,8 --> 1:24:47,72
Your health pays for it in endless sorts of ways:


1740
1:24:47,72 --> 1:24:51,64
something known as the 'health socioeconomic gradient'.


1741
1:24:51,64 --> 1:24:53,92
As you move down from the highest strata


1742
1:24:53,92 --> 1:24:56,72
in society, in terms of socioeconomic status


1743
1:24:56,72 --> 1:24:59,8
every step down, health gets worse


1744
1:24:59,8 --> 1:25:1,32
for umpteen different diseases.


1745
1:25:1,32 --> 1:25:2,84
Life expectancy gets worse.


1746
1:25:2,84 --> 1:25:5,0
Infant mortality rate-


1747
1:25:5,0 --> 1:25:6,36
everything you could look at.


1748
1:25:6,36 --> 1:25:8,88
So, a huge issue has been


1749
1:25:8,88 --> 1:25:12,48
why is it that this gradient exists.


1750
1:25:12,48 --> 1:25:14,4
A simple obvious answer


1751
1:25:14,4 --> 1:25:16,44
which is, 'if you're chronically sick, you're not


1752
1:25:16,44 --> 1:25:18,96
going to be very productive


1753
1:25:18,96 --> 1:25:21,8
so, health causes drive socioeconomic differences.'


1754
1:25:21,8 --> 1:25:23,32
Not that in the slightest-


1755
1:25:23,32 --> 1:25:24,88
on the very simple level that


1756
1:25:24,88 --> 1:25:26,2
you could look at the


1757
1:25:26,2 --> 1:25:28,32
socioeconomic status of a 10-year-old


1758
1:25:28,32 --> 1:25:30,72
and that's going to predict something about their health


1759
1:25:30,72 --> 1:25:31,84
decades later.


1760
1:25:31,84 --> 1:25:33,92
So, that's the direction of causality.


1761
1:25:33,92 --> 1:25:37,24
Next one- 'Oh, it's perfectly obvious'-


1762
1:25:37,24 --> 1:25:39,36
poor people can't afford to go to the doctor...


1763
1:25:39,36 --> 1:25:40,84
it's healthcare access?


1764
1:25:40,84 --> 1:25:42,32
It's got nothing to do with that


1765
1:25:42,32 --> 1:25:44,2
because you see these same gradients


1766
1:25:44,2 --> 1:25:46,32
in countries with universal health care and


1767
1:25:46,32 --> 1:25:47,8
socialized medicine.


1768
1:25:47,8 --> 1:25:49,64
Okay – next 'simple explanation':


1769
1:25:49,64 --> 1:25:51,72
Oh -on the average- the poorer you are


1770
1:25:51,72 --> 1:25:54,0
the more likely you are to smoke


1771
1:25:54,0 --> 1:25:58,8
and drink and all sorts of lifestyle risk factors.


1772
1:25:58,8 --> 1:26:1,56
Yeah, those contribute but careful studies have shown


1773
1:26:1,56 --> 1:26:4,48
that it explains maybe about a third of the variability.


1774
1:26:4,48 --> 1:26:5,88
So what's left?


1775
1:26:5,88 --> 1:26:8,6
What's left is having a ton to do


1776
1:26:8,6 --> 1:26:11,32
with the STRESS of poverty


1777
1:26:11,32 --> 1:26:14,64
So, the poorer you are, starting off being


1778
1:26:14,64 --> 1:26:18,36
the person who is one dollar of income behind Bill Gates...


1779
1:26:18,36 --> 1:26:19,88
the poorer you are in this country


1780
1:26:19,88 --> 1:26:21,6
on the average, the worse your health is.


1781
1:26:21,6 --> 1:26:24,28
This tells us something really important:


1782
1:26:24,28 --> 1:26:26,16
the health connection with poverty


1783
1:26:26,16 --> 1:26:30,24
it's not about being poor it's about feeling poor.


1784
1:26:30,24 --> 1:26:35,56
Increasingly we recognize that chronic stress


1785
1:26:35,56 --> 1:26:38,8
is an important influence on health


1786
1:26:38,8 --> 1:26:40,84
but the most important sources of stress


1787
1:26:40,84 --> 1:26:43,72
are the quality of social relations.


1788
1:26:43,72 --> 1:26:45,36
and if there is anything that


1789
1:26:45,36 --> 1:26:47,56
lowers the quality of social relations


1790
1:26:47,56 --> 1:26:51,44
it is the socioeconomic stratification of society.


1791
1:26:51,44 --> 1:26:53,16
What science has now shown is


1792
1:26:53,16 --> 1:26:55,44
that regardless of material wealth


1793
1:26:55,44 --> 1:26:59,16
the stress of simply living in a stratified society


1794
1:26:59,16 --> 1:27:2,88
leads to a vast spectrum of public health problems


1795
1:27:2,88 --> 1:27:7,8
and the greater the inequality, the worse they become.


1796
1:27:7,8 --> 1:27:11,52
Life expectancy: longer in more equal countries.


1797
1:27:11,52 --> 1:27:15,64
Drug Abuse: Less in more equal countries.


1798
1:27:15,64 --> 1:27:20,0
Mental Illness: Less in more equal countries.


1799
1:27:20,0 --> 1:27:22,0
Social Capital - meaning the


1800
1:27:22,0 --> 1:27:24,64
ability of people to trust each other:


1801
1:27:24,64 --> 1:27:27,92
Naturally greater in more equal countries.


1802
1:27:27,92 --> 1:27:32,44
Educational Scores: Higher in more equal countries.


1803
1:27:32,44 --> 1:27:37,4
Homicide rates: less in more equal countries.


1804
1:27:37,4 --> 1:27:39,36
Crime and Rates of Imprisonment:


1805
1:27:39,36 --> 1:27:42,0
Less in more equal countries.


1806
1:27:42,0 --> 1:27:44,28
It goes on and on:


1807
1:27:44,28 --> 1:27:47,84
Infant mortality – obesity - teen birth rate:


1808
1:27:47,84 --> 1:27:49,92
Less in more equal countries.


1809
1:27:49,92 --> 1:27:52,24
and perhaps most interesting:


1810
1:27:52,24 --> 1:27:56,44
Innovation: Greater in more equal countries.


1811
1:27:56,44 --> 1:27:59,84
which challenges the age old notion that a competitive


1812
1:27:59,84 --> 1:28:4,8
stratified society is somehow more creative and inventive.


1813
1:28:4,8 --> 1:28:6,84
Moreover, a study done in the UK


1814
1:28:6,84 --> 1:28:8,4
called The WhiteHall Study


1815
1:28:8,4 --> 1:28:11,4
confirmed that there is a social distribution of disease


1816
1:28:11,4 --> 1:28:14,28
as you go from the top of the socioeconomic ladder


1817
1:28:14,28 --> 1:28:15,36
to the bottom.


1818
1:28:15,36 --> 1:28:17,64
For example, it was found that the lowest rungs


1819
1:28:17,64 --> 1:28:20,44
of the hierarchy had a 4-fold increase


1820
1:28:20,44 --> 1:28:22,72
of heart disease based mortality


1821
1:28:22,72 --> 1:28:24,84
compared to the highest rungs.


1822
1:28:24,84 --> 1:28:29,4
And this pattern exists, irrespective of access to health care.


1823
1:28:29,4 --> 1:28:32,72
Hence - the worse a person's relative financial status


1824
1:28:32,72 --> 1:28:35,96
the worse their health is going to be on average.


1825
1:28:35,96 --> 1:28:38,76
This phenomenon is rooted in what could be termed


1826
1:28:38,76 --> 1:28:40,92
Psychosocial Stress'


1827
1:28:40,92 --> 1:28:44,48
and it is at the foundation of the greatest social distortions


1828
1:28:44,48 --> 1:28:46,84
plaguing our society today.


1829
1:28:46,84 --> 1:28:48,24
Its cause?


1830
1:28:48,24 --> 1:28:51,68
The Monetary-Market System.


1831
1:28:51,68 --> 1:28:53,68
Make no mistake:


1832
1:28:53,68 --> 1:28:56,28
The greatest destroyer of ecology...


1833
1:28:56,28 --> 1:29:0,16
the greatest source of waste, depletion and pollution...


1834
1:29:0,16 --> 1:29:2,56
the greatest purveyor of violence-


1835
1:29:2,56 --> 1:29:7,28
war - crime - poverty - animal abuse and inhumanity...


1836
1:29:7,28 --> 1:29:10,92
the greatest generator of social and personal neurosis...


1837
1:29:10,92 --> 1:29:14,4
mental disorders - depression anxiety...


1838
1:29:14,4 --> 1:29:18,4
Not to mention, the greatest source of social paralysis


1839
1:29:18,4 --> 1:29:21,28
stopping us from moving into new methodologies


1840
1:29:21,28 --> 1:29:24,28
for personal health, global sustainability


1841
1:29:24,28 --> 1:29:27,32
and progress on this planet


1842
1:29:27,32 --> 1:29:30,72
is not some corrupt Government or legislation...


1843
1:29:30,72 --> 1:29:34,88
not some rogue Corporation or banking cartel...


1844
1:29:34,88 --> 1:29:37,96
not some flaw of human nature...


1845
1:29:37,96 --> 1:29:42,52
and not some secret hidden cabal that controls the world.


1846
1:29:42,52 --> 1:29:43,96
It is, in fact:


1847
1:29:43,96 --> 1:29:46,48
The Socio-Economic System itself


1848
1:29:46,48 --> 1:30:5,0
at its very foundation.


1849
1:30:5,0 --> 1:30:10,68
[Part 3: Project Earth ]


1850
1:30:10,68 --> 1:30:13,12
Let's imagine for a moment we had the option


1851
1:30:13,12 --> 1:30:16,2
to redesign human civilization from the ground up.


1852
1:30:16,2 --> 1:30:18,2
What if, hypothetically speaking


1853
1:30:18,2 --> 1:30:21,16
we discovered an exact replica of the planet Earth


1854
1:30:21,16 --> 1:30:23,8
and the only difference between


1855
1:30:23,8 --> 1:30:24,6
this new planet and our current one


1856
1:30:24,6 --> 1:30:27,8
is that human evolution had not occurred.


1857
1:30:27,8 --> 1:30:28,64
It was an open palette.


1858
1:30:28,64 --> 1:30:32,68
No countries, no cities, no pollution, no republicans....


1859
1:30:32,68 --> 1:30:35,64
just a pristine, open environment.


1860
1:30:35,64 --> 1:30:37,68
So what would we do?


1861
1:30:37,68 --> 1:30:40,44
Well, first we need a “goal”, right?


1862
1:30:40,44 --> 1:30:43,92
And it's safe to say that goal would be to survive.


1863
1:30:43,92 --> 1:30:47,68
And not to just survive, but to do so in an optimized, healthy


1864
1:30:47,68 --> 1:30:49,24
prosperous way.


1865
1:30:49,24 --> 1:30:51,56
Most people, indeed, desire to live and


1866
1:30:51,56 --> 1:30:54,4
they would prefer to do so without suffering.


1867
1:30:54,4 --> 1:30:56,6
Therefore, the basis of this civilization


1868
1:30:56,6 --> 1:30:58,84
needs to be as supportive and hence


1869
1:30:58,84 --> 1:31:1,48
sustainable for human life as possible-


1870
1:31:1,48 --> 1:31:3,64
taking into account the material needs


1871
1:31:3,64 --> 1:31:5,32
of all the world's people


1872
1:31:5,32 --> 1:31:7,4
while trying to remove anything


1873
1:31:7,4 --> 1:31:9,52
that can could hurt us in the long run.


1874
1:31:9,52 --> 1:31:13,76
With that goal of “Maximum Sustainability” understood


1875
1:31:13,76 --> 1:31:16,64
next question regards our “method”.


1876
1:31:16,64 --> 1:31:18,96
What kind of approach do we take?


1877
1:31:18,96 --> 1:31:20,4
Well, let's see-


1878
1:31:20,4 --> 1:31:24,8
last I checked, politics was the method of social operation on Earth...


1879
1:31:24,8 --> 1:31:27,76
so what do the doctrines of the republicans, liberals


1880
1:31:27,76 --> 1:31:32,64
conservatives or socialists have to say about societal design?


1881
1:31:32,64 --> 1:31:35,84
Hmmm... not a damn thing.


1882
1:31:35,84 --> 1:31:38,4
Okay then - what about religion?


1883
1:31:38,4 --> 1:31:41,92
Surely the great creator had to have left some blueprints somewhere...


1884
1:31:41,92 --> 1:31:44,48
Nope...nothing I can find.


1885
1:31:44,48 --> 1:31:46,84
Okay then - so what's left?


1886
1:31:46,84 --> 1:31:49,72
It appears something called “Science”.


1887
1:31:49,72 --> 1:31:53,64
Science is unique in that its methods demand not only that ideas


1888
1:31:53,64 --> 1:31:56,56
proposed be tested and replicated...


1889
1:31:56,56 --> 1:32:1,2
but everything science comes up with is also inherently falsifiable.


1890
1:32:1,2 --> 1:32:3,8
In other words, unlike religion and politics


1891
1:32:3,8 --> 1:32:5,52
science has no ego


1892
1:32:5,52 --> 1:32:8,56
and everything it suggests accepts the possibility


1893
1:32:8,56 --> 1:32:11,36
of being proven wrong eventually.


1894
1:32:11,36 --> 1:32:14,68
It holds on to nothing and evolves constantly.


1895
1:32:14,68 --> 1:32:17,32
Well, that sounds natural enough to me.


1896
1:32:17,32 --> 1:32:20,64
So then - based on the current state of scientific knowledge


1897
1:32:20,64 --> 1:32:22,52
in the early 21st century


1898
1:32:22,52 --> 1:32:25,28
along with our goal of “maximum sustainability”


1899
1:32:25,28 --> 1:32:27,4
for the human population


1900
1:32:27,4 --> 1:32:30,6
how do we begin the actual process of construction?


1901
1:32:30,6 --> 1:32:32,52
Well, the first question to ask is:


1902
1:32:32,52 --> 1:32:35,4
What do we need to survive?


1903
1:32:35,4 --> 1:32:38,56
The answer, of course, are Planetary Resources.


1904
1:32:38,56 --> 1:32:41,68
Whether it is the water we drink, the energy we use


1905
1:32:41,68 --> 1:32:45,64
or the raw materials we utilize to create tools and shelter


1906
1:32:45,64 --> 1:32:48,76
the planet hosts an inventory of resources-


1907
1:32:48,76 --> 1:32:52,48
many of which are demanded for our survival.


1908
1:32:52,48 --> 1:32:54,8
So, given that reality


1909
1:32:54,8 --> 1:32:58,84
it then becomes critical to figure out what we have and where it is.


1910
1:32:58,84 --> 1:33:1,24
This means we need to conduct a survey.


1911
1:33:1,24 --> 1:33:5,4
We simply locate and identify every physical resource on the planet


1912
1:33:5,4 --> 1:33:9,24
we can, along with the amount available at each location


1913
1:33:9,24 --> 1:33:12,56
from the deposits of copper, to the most potent locations for


1914
1:33:12,56 --> 1:33:14,96
wind farms to produce energy


1915
1:33:14,96 --> 1:33:17,0
to the natural fresh water springs


1916
1:33:17,0 --> 1:33:19,88
to an assessment of the amount of fish in the ocean


1917
1:33:19,88 --> 1:33:24,96
to the most prime arable land for food cultivation, etc.


1918
1:33:24,96 --> 1:33:27,4
But, since we humans are going to be


1919
1:33:27,4 --> 1:33:29,48
consuming these resources over time


1920
1:33:29,48 --> 1:33:33,72
we then realize that not only do we need to locate and identify-


1921
1:33:33,72 --> 1:33:36,4
we also need to track.


1922
1:33:36,4 --> 1:33:38,72
We need to make sure we don't run out of any of this stuff...


1923
1:33:38,72 --> 1:33:40,16
that would be bad.


1924
1:33:40,16 --> 1:33:42,92
And this means not only tracking our rates of use


1925
1:33:42,92 --> 1:33:46,44
but the rates of earthly regeneration as well


1926
1:33:46,44 --> 1:33:49,16
such as how long it takes for, say


1927
1:33:49,16 --> 1:33:52,2
a tree to grow or a spring to replenish.


1928
1:33:52,2 --> 1:33:55,8
This is called “Dynamic Equilibrium”.


1929
1:33:55,8 --> 1:33:59,92
In other words, if we use up trees faster than they can be grown back-


1930
1:33:59,92 --> 1:34:3,96
we have a serious problem, for it is unsustainable.


1931
1:34:3,96 --> 1:34:6,72
So then, how do we track this inventory


1932
1:34:6,72 --> 1:34:9,12
especially when we recognize that all


1933
1:34:9,12 --> 1:34:11,6
of this stuff is scattered everywhere.


1934
1:34:11,6 --> 1:34:15,2
We have large mineral mines in what we call Africa


1935
1:34:15,2 --> 1:34:17,56
energy concentrations in the Middle East


1936
1:34:17,56 --> 1:34:21,48
huge tidal power possibilities on the Atlantic coast of North America


1937
1:34:21,48 --> 1:34:25,88
the largest supply of fresh water in Brazil, etc.


1938
1:34:25,88 --> 1:34:29,88
Well, once again, good old science has a suggestion:


1939
1:34:29,88 --> 1:34:32,2
it's called “Systems theory”.


1940
1:34:32,2 --> 1:34:36,12
Systems theory recognizes that the fabric of the natural world


1941
1:34:36,12 --> 1:34:39,32
from human biology to the earthly biosphere


1942
1:34:39,32 --> 1:34:42,56
to the gravitational pull of the solar system itself


1943
1:34:42,56 --> 1:34:47,84
is one huge synergistically connected system - fully interlinked.


1944
1:34:47,84 --> 1:34:50,64
Just as human cells connect to form our organs


1945
1:34:50,64 --> 1:34:53,4
and the organs connect to form our bodies


1946
1:34:53,4 --> 1:34:56,28
and since our bodies cannot live without the earthy resources


1947
1:34:56,28 --> 1:35:1,0
of food, air and water, we are intrinsically connected to the earth.


1948
1:35:1,0 --> 1:35:2,88
And so on.


1949
1:35:2,88 --> 1:35:6,0
So - as nature suggests, we take all of this inventory


1950
1:35:6,0 --> 1:35:10,12
and tracking data and create a “system” to manage it.


1951
1:35:10,12 --> 1:35:13,56
A “Global Resource Management System”, in fact


1952
1:35:13,56 --> 1:35:17,0
to account for every relevant resource on the planet.


1953
1:35:17,0 --> 1:35:21,0
There is simply no logical alternative if our goal as a species


1954
1:35:21,0 --> 1:35:26,28
is survival in the long run. We have to keep track as a whole.


1955
1:35:26,28 --> 1:35:29,6
That understood, we can now consider production.


1956
1:35:29,6 --> 1:35:31,32
How do we use all this stuff?


1957
1:35:31,32 --> 1:35:34,72
What will our process of production be and what do we need


1958
1:35:34,72 --> 1:35:38,32
to consider to make sure it is as optimized as possible


1959
1:35:38,32 --> 1:35:41,72
to maximize our sustainability?


1960
1:35:41,72 --> 1:35:44,64
Well the first thing that jumps right out at us is the fact that


1961
1:35:44,64 --> 1:35:47,6
we need to constantly try and preserve.


1962
1:35:47,6 --> 1:35:50,76
The planet's resources are essentially finite.


1963
1:35:50,76 --> 1:35:53,68
So it is important that we be “strategic”.


1964
1:35:53,68 --> 1:35:57,24
"Strategic Preservation" is key.


1965
1:35:57,24 --> 1:36:0,2
The second thing we recognize, is that some resources


1966
1:36:0,2 --> 1:36:3,24
are really not as good as others in their performance.


1967
1:36:3,24 --> 1:36:6,8
In fact, some of this stuff, when put into use


1968
1:36:6,8 --> 1:36:8,28
has a terrible effect of the environment


1969
1:36:8,28 --> 1:36:10,96
which invariably hinders our own health.


1970
1:36:10,96 --> 1:36:15,36
For example: oil and fossil fuels, no matter how you cut it


1971
1:36:15,36 --> 1:36:18,84
release some pretty destructive agents into the environment.


1972
1:36:18,84 --> 1:36:22,2
Therefore, it is critical that we do our best to use such things


1973
1:36:22,2 --> 1:36:25,92
only when we really have to - if at all.


1974
1:36:25,92 --> 1:36:30,88
Fortunately for us, we see a ton of solar – wind – tidal – wave -


1975
1:36:30,88 --> 1:36:35,4
heat differential and geothermal possibilities for energy production


1976
1:36:35,4 --> 1:36:39,48
so we can strategize objectively about what we use and where


1977
1:36:39,48 --> 1:36:43,72
to avoid what could be called “negative retroactions”


1978
1:36:43,72 --> 1:36:47,2
or anything that results from production or use


1979
1:36:47,2 --> 1:36:50,76
that damages the environment and hence, ourselves.


1980
1:36:50,76 --> 1:36:53,76
We will call this “Strategic Safety”


1981
1:36:53,76 --> 1:36:57,88
to couple in with our "Strategic Preservation”.


1982
1:36:57,88 --> 1:37:0,44
But production strategies do not stop there.


1983
1:37:0,44 --> 1:37:3,52
We are going to need an "Efficiency Strategy”


1984
1:37:3,52 --> 1:37:6,72
for the actual mechanics of production itself.


1985
1:37:6,72 --> 1:37:9,36
And what we find is that there are roughly


1986
1:37:9,36 --> 1:37:12,12
three specific protocols we must adhere to:


1987
1:37:12,12 --> 1:37:14,56
One: Every good we produce must be


1988
1:37:14,56 --> 1:37:17,28
designed to last as long as possible.


1989
1:37:17,28 --> 1:37:19,52
Naturally, the more things breakdown


1990
1:37:19,52 --> 1:37:22,56
the more resources we are going to need to replace them


1991
1:37:22,56 --> 1:37:24,96
and the more waste produced.


1992
1:37:24,96 --> 1:37:27,44
Two: When things do break down


1993
1:37:27,44 --> 1:37:30,4
or are no longer usable for whatever reason


1994
1:37:30,4 --> 1:37:34,72
it is critical that we harvest, or recycle as much as we possibly can.


1995
1:37:34,72 --> 1:37:38,8
So the production design must take this into


1996
1:37:38,8 --> 1:37:41,68
account directly at the very earliest stages.


1997
1:37:41,68 --> 1:37:45,88
Three: Quickly evolving technologies, such as electronics


1998
1:37:45,88 --> 1:37:49,6
which are subject to the fastest rates of technological obsolescence


1999
1:37:49,6 --> 1:37:51,88
would need to be designed to


2000
1:37:51,88 --> 1:37:55,44
foreshadow and accommodate physical updates.


2001
1:37:55,44 --> 1:37:59,16
The last thing we want to do is throw away an entire computer


2002
1:37:59,16 --> 1:38:3,8
system just because it has only one broken part or is outdated.


2003
1:38:3,8 --> 1:38:6,88
So we simply design the components to be easily updated


2004
1:38:6,88 --> 1:38:11,4
part by part, standardized and universally interchangeable


2005
1:38:11,4 --> 1:38:15,68
foreshadowed by the current trend of technological change.


2006
1:38:15,68 --> 1:38:19,44
And when we realize that the mechanisms of "Strategic Preservation”


2007
1:38:19,44 --> 1:38:22,96
“Strategic Safety” and “Strategic Efficiency”


2008
1:38:22,96 --> 1:38:25,68
are purely technical considerations


2009
1:38:25,68 --> 1:38:28,88
devoid of any human opinion or bias


2010
1:38:28,88 --> 1:38:31,96
we simply program these strategies into a computer


2011
1:38:31,96 --> 1:38:35,0
which can weigh and calculate all the relevant variables


2012
1:38:35,0 --> 1:38:37,4
allowing us to always arrive at the


2013
1:38:37,4 --> 1:38:40,8
absolute best method for sustainable production


2014
1:38:40,8 --> 1:38:43,56
based on current understandings.


2015
1:38:43,56 --> 1:38:46,4
And while that might sound complex


2016
1:38:46,4 --> 1:38:48,52
all it is is a glorified calculator


2017
1:38:48,52 --> 1:38:50,48
not to mention that such multi-varied


2018
1:38:50,48 --> 1:38:52,72
decision making and monitoring systems


2019
1:38:52,72 --> 1:38:54,92
are already used across the world today


2020
1:38:54,92 --> 1:39:0,16
for isolated purposes. It is simply a process of scaling it out.


2021
1:39:0,16 --> 1:39:1,4
So...


2022
1:39:1,4 --> 1:39:4,64
Now, we not only have our Resource Management System


2023
1:39:4,64 --> 1:39:7,8
but also a Production Management System


2024
1:39:7,8 --> 1:39:10,4
both of which are easily computer automated


2025
1:39:10,4 --> 1:39:14,32
to maximize efficiency, preservation & safety.


2026
1:39:14,32 --> 1:39:17,28
The informational reality is that the human mind


2027
1:39:17,28 --> 1:39:21,28
or even a group of humans, cannot track what needs to be tracked.


2028
1:39:21,28 --> 1:39:25,84
It must be done by computers and it can be.


2029
1:39:25,84 --> 1:39:29,4
And this bring us to the next level: Distribution.


2030
1:39:29,4 --> 1:39:32,48
What sustainability strategies make sense here?


2031
1:39:32,48 --> 1:39:33,92
Well, since we know that the shortest


2032
1:39:33,92 --> 1:39:37,12
distance between two points is a straight line


2033
1:39:37,12 --> 1:39:40,64
and since energy is required to power transport machines


2034
1:39:40,64 --> 1:39:44,16
the less transport distance, the more efficient.


2035
1:39:44,16 --> 1:39:48,4
Producing goods in one continent and shipping them over to another


2036
1:39:48,4 --> 1:39:51,48
only makes sense if the goods in question simply cannot


2037
1:39:51,48 --> 1:39:54,0
be produced in the target area.


2038
1:39:54,0 --> 1:39:56,72
Otherwise, it is nothing but wasteful.


2039
1:39:56,72 --> 1:40:0,4
We must localize production, so distribution is simple


2040
1:40:0,4 --> 1:40:3,56
fast and requires the least amount of energy.


2041
1:40:3,56 --> 1:40:6,48
We'll call this the “Proximity Strategy”


2042
1:40:6,48 --> 1:40:8,32
which simply means we reduce the


2043
1:40:8,32 --> 1:40:10,28
travel of goods as much as possible


2044
1:40:10,28 --> 1:40:14,32
whether raw materials or finished consumer products.


2045
1:40:14,32 --> 1:40:16,8
Of course, it might also be important to


2046
1:40:16,8 --> 1:40:19,52
know what goods are we transporting and why...


2047
1:40:19,52 --> 1:40:22,76
And this falls under the category of Demand.


2048
1:40:22,76 --> 1:40:25,4
And demand is simply what people need to be


2049
1:40:25,4 --> 1:40:28,0
healthy and to have a high quality of life.


2050
1:40:28,0 --> 1:40:30,28
The spectrum of material human needs


2051
1:40:30,28 --> 1:40:33,36
range from core life supporting necessities


2052
1:40:33,36 --> 1:40:36,52
such as food, clean water and shelter...


2053
1:40:36,52 --> 1:40:40,28
to social and recreational goods which allow for relaxation


2054
1:40:40,28 --> 1:40:42,72
and personal - social enjoyment -


2055
1:40:42,72 --> 1:40:47,68
both important factors in human and social health overall.


2056
1:40:47,68 --> 1:40:50,48
So - very simply- we take another survey.


2057
1:40:50,48 --> 1:40:52,88
People describe their needs, demand is


2058
1:40:52,88 --> 1:40:56,2
assessed and production begins based on that demand.


2059
1:40:56,2 --> 1:40:59,4
And since the level of demand of different goods will


2060
1:40:59,4 --> 1:41:2,76
naturally fluctuate and change around different regions


2061
1:41:2,76 --> 1:41:6,68
we need to create a “Demand / Distribution Tracking System"


2062
1:41:6,68 --> 1:41:10,28
so to avoid overruns and shortages.


2063
1:41:10,28 --> 1:41:12,36
Of course, this idea is old news


2064
1:41:12,36 --> 1:41:15,44
it is used in every major store chain today


2065
1:41:15,44 --> 1:41:18,16
to make sure they keep up with their inventory.


2066
1:41:18,16 --> 1:41:21,92
Only this time, we are tracking on a global scale.


2067
1:41:21,92 --> 1:41:25,76
But wait a minute. We really can't fully understand demand


2068
1:41:25,76 --> 1:41:30,4
if we don't account for the actual usage of the good itself.


2069
1:41:30,4 --> 1:41:34,12
Is it logical and sustainable for every single human to, say


2070
1:41:34,12 --> 1:41:38,64
have one of everything made? Regardless of their usage?


2071
1:41:38,64 --> 1:41:43,0
No. That would be simply wasteful and inefficient.


2072
1:41:43,0 --> 1:41:46,84
If a person has a need for a good but that need is only for say:


2073
1:41:46,84 --> 1:41:49,16
45 minutes a day on average


2074
1:41:49,16 --> 1:41:51,0
it would be much more efficient if


2075
1:41:51,0 --> 1:41:52,84
that good was made available to them


2076
1:41:52,84 --> 1:41:56,0
and to others when needed.


2077
1:41:56,0 --> 1:41:58,84
Many forget that it isn't the good they want


2078
1:41:58,84 --> 1:42:0,88
it is the purpose of that good.


2079
1:42:0,88 --> 1:42:3,0
When we realize that the good itself


2080
1:42:3,0 --> 1:42:5,24
is only as important as its utility


2081
1:42:5,24 --> 1:42:8,8
we see that “external restriction”


2082
1:42:8,8 --> 1:42:10,84
or what we might call today “ownership”


2083
1:42:10,84 --> 1:42:14,28
is extremely wasteful and environmentally illogical


2084
1:42:14,28 --> 1:42:17,6
in a fundamental, economic sense.


2085
1:42:17,6 --> 1:42:22,84
So we need devise a strategy called: “Strategic Access”.


2086
1:42:22,84 --> 1:42:24,76
This would be the foundation of our


2087
1:42:24,76 --> 1:42:26,92
"Demand / Distribution Tracking System.”


2088
1:42:26,92 --> 1:42:28,68
which makes sure we can meet the


2089
1:42:28,68 --> 1:42:30,36
demand of the population's needs


2090
1:42:30,36 --> 1:42:34,84
for access of whatever they need, when they need it.


2091
1:42:34,84 --> 1:42:37,56
And as far as physically obtaining the goods


2092
1:42:37,56 --> 1:42:39,72
centralized and regional access


2093
1:42:39,72 --> 1:42:42,48
centers all make sense for the most part


2094
1:42:42,48 --> 1:42:45,68
placed in close proximity to the population


2095
1:42:45,68 --> 1:42:48,56
and a person would simply come in, take the item


2096
1:42:48,56 --> 1:42:52,28
use it and when finished, return it when no longer needed...


2097
1:42:52,28 --> 1:42:54,68
sort of how a library works today.


2098
1:42:54,68 --> 1:42:57,4
In fact, these centers could not only exist in


2099
1:42:57,4 --> 1:43:0,12
the community in the way we see local stores today


2100
1:43:0,12 --> 1:43:4,36
but specialized access centers would exist in specific areas


2101
1:43:4,36 --> 1:43:6,84
where often certain goods are utilized


2102
1:43:6,84 --> 1:43:10,56
saving more energy with less repeat transport.


2103
1:43:10,56 --> 1:43:13,88
And once this Demand Tracking System is in order


2104
1:43:13,88 --> 1:43:16,6
it is tied into our Production Management system


2105
1:43:16,6 --> 1:43:20,4
and, of course, into our Resource Management system


2106
1:43:20,4 --> 1:43:23,8
hence creating a unified dynamically updating


2107
1:43:23,8 --> 1:43:26,4
global economic management machine


2108
1:43:26,4 --> 1:43:28,88
that simply makes sure we remain sustainable


2109
1:43:28,88 --> 1:43:32,76
starting with securing the integrity of our finite resources


2110
1:43:32,76 --> 1:43:35,6
moving to make sure we only create the best


2111
1:43:35,6 --> 1:43:37,6
most strategic goods possible


2112
1:43:37,6 --> 1:43:40,16
while distributing everything in the


2113
1:43:40,16 --> 1:43:42,72
most intelligent and efficient way.


2114
1:43:42,72 --> 1:43:47,4
And the unique result of this preservation based approach


2115
1:43:47,4 --> 1:43:50,16
which is intuitively counter to many


2116
1:43:50,16 --> 1:43:52,6
is that this logical, ground up


2117
1:43:52,6 --> 1:43:56,16
empirical process of preservation and efficiency


2118
1:43:56,16 --> 1:44:1,4
which can only define true human sustainability on the planet


2119
1:44:1,4 --> 1:44:5,72
would likely enable something never before seen in human history.


2120
1:44:5,72 --> 1:44:7,84
Access Abundance...


2121
1:44:7,84 --> 1:44:11,12
not just for a percentage of the global population...


2122
1:44:11,12 --> 1:44:15,56
but the entire civilization.


2123
1:44:15,56 --> 1:44:18,28
This economic model, as was just generalized...


2124
1:44:18,28 --> 1:44:21,4
This responsible, systems approach to total Earth


2125
1:44:21,4 --> 1:44:24,12
resource management and processes


2126
1:44:24,12 --> 1:44:26,4
designed again to do nothing less


2127
1:44:26,4 --> 1:44:28,2
than take care of humanity as whole


2128
1:44:28,2 --> 1:44:31,4
in the most efficient and sustainable way


2129
1:44:31,4 --> 1:44:32,36
could be termed:


2130
1:44:32,36 --> 1:44:35,48
a “RESOURCE-BASED ECONOMY”.


2131
1:44:35,48 --> 1:44:38,4
The idea was defined in the 1970s by


2132
1:44:38,4 --> 1:44:41,12
Social Engineer- Jacque Fresco.


2133
1:44:41,12 --> 1:44:44,4
He understood back then that society was on a collision course


2134
1:44:44,4 --> 1:44:48,64
with nature and itself - unsustainable on every level


2135
1:44:48,64 --> 1:44:50,6
and if things didn't change


2136
1:44:50,6 --> 1:44:54,4
we would destroy ourselves, one way or another.


2137
1:44:54,4 --> 1:44:56,28
Are all of these things you are saying, Jacque...


2138
1:44:56,28 --> 1:44:58,76
could they be built with what we know today?


2139
1:44:58,76 --> 1:45:3,4
Or are you guessing... based on what we know today.


2140
1:45:3,4 --> 1:45:6,36
No, all of these things can be built with what we know today.


2141
1:45:6,36 --> 1:45:9,44
It would take 10 years to change the surface of the earth.


2142
1:45:9,44 --> 1:45:12,2
To rebuild the world into a second Garden of Eden.


2143
1:45:12,2 --> 1:45:13,72
The choice lies with you.


2144
1:45:13,72 --> 1:45:16,24
The stupidity of a nuclear arms race...


2145
1:45:16,24 --> 1:45:17,8
the development of weapons...


2146
1:45:17,8 --> 1:45:20,4
trying to solve your problems politically


2147
1:45:20,4 --> 1:45:23,12
by electing this political party or that political party...


2148
1:45:23,12 --> 1:45:25,68
that all politics is immersed in corruption.


2149
1:45:25,68 --> 1:45:26,8
Let me say it again:


2150
1:45:26,8 --> 1:45:30,32
Communism, socialism, fascism... the Democrats


2151
1:45:30,32 --> 1:45:33,6
the liberals- we want to absorb human beings.


2152
1:45:33,6 --> 1:45:37,4
All organizations that believe in a better life for man:


2153
1:45:37,4 --> 1:45:40,16
there are no Negro problems or Polish problems


2154
1:45:40,16 --> 1:45:42,48
or Jewish problems or Greek problems


2155
1:45:42,48 --> 1:45:45,0
or women's problems – there are human problems!


2156
1:45:45,0 --> 1:45:47,88
I'm not afraid of anybody; I don't work for anyone;


2157
1:45:47,88 --> 1:45:49,48
no one can discharge me.


2158
1:45:49,48 --> 1:45:50,92
I have no boss.


2159
1:45:50,92 --> 1:45:54,4
I am afraid to live in the society we live in today.


2160
1:45:54,4 --> 1:45:57,84
Our society cannot be maintained by this type of incompetency.


2161
1:45:57,84 --> 1:45:59,96
It was great - the free enterprise system -


2162
1:45:59,96 --> 1:46:3,48
about 35 years ago. That was the last of its usefulness.


2163
1:46:3,48 --> 1:46:8,4
Now, we have got to change our way of thinking or perish.


2164
1:46:8,4 --> 1:46:12,8
The horror movies of the future will be our society...


2165
1:46:12,8 --> 1:46:14,4
the way it didn't work


2166
1:46:14,4 --> 1:46:15,4
and politics...


2167
1:46:15,4 --> 1:46:19,8
would be part of a horror movie.


2168
1:46:19,8 --> 1:46:24,76
Well, lots of people today use the term 'cold science'


2169
1:46:24,76 --> 1:46:27,12
because it's analytical


2170
1:46:27,12 --> 1:46:29,88
and they don't even know what analytical means.


2171
1:46:29,88 --> 1:46:32,8
Science means: closer approximations


2172
1:46:32,8 --> 1:46:35,6
to the way the world really works.


2173
1:46:35,6 --> 1:46:38,84
So, it's telling the truth - is what it is


2174
1:46:38,84 --> 1:46:41,76
A scientist doesn't try to get along with people.


2175
1:46:41,76 --> 1:46:44,44
They tell them what their findings are.


2176
1:46:44,44 --> 1:46:47,4
They have to question all things


2177
1:46:47,4 --> 1:46:51,16
and if some scientist comes up with an experiment that shows


2178
1:46:51,16 --> 1:46:53,68
certain materials have certain strengths


2179
1:46:53,68 --> 1:46:56,32
other scientists have to be able to duplicate


2180
1:46:56,32 --> 1:46:59,28
that experiment and come up with the same results.


2181
1:46:59,28 --> 1:47:3,48
Even if a scientist feels that an airplane wing


2182
1:47:3,48 --> 1:47:5,6
due to mathematics or calculations


2183
1:47:5,6 --> 1:47:7,92
can hold up a given amount of weight


2184
1:47:7,92 --> 1:47:10,8
they still pile sandbags on it


2185
1:47:10,8 --> 1:47:12,72
to see when it breaks and they say


2186
1:47:12,72 --> 1:47:16,48
you know my calculations are right or they are not correct'.


2187
1:47:16,48 --> 1:47:19,96
I love that system because it's free of bias


2188
1:47:19,96 --> 1:47:23,4
and free of thinking that math can solve all the problems.


2189
1:47:23,4 --> 1:47:26,24
You have to put your Math to test also.


2190
1:47:26,24 --> 1:47:28,8
I think that every system that can


2191
1:47:28,8 --> 1:47:31,56
be put to test should be put to test.


2192
1:47:31,56 --> 1:47:36,76
And that all decisions should be based upon research.


2193
1:47:36,76 --> 1:47:39,36
A Resource-Based Economy is simply the


2194
1:47:39,36 --> 1:47:42,2
scientific method applied to social concern-


2195
1:47:42,2 --> 1:47:45,28
an approach utterly absent in the world today.


2196
1:47:45,28 --> 1:47:47,56
Society is a technical invention.


2197
1:47:47,56 --> 1:47:50,68
And the most efficient methods of optimized human health


2198
1:47:50,68 --> 1:47:55,8
physical production, distribution, city infrastructure and the like


2199
1:47:55,8 --> 1:47:57,52
reside in the field of science and


2200
1:47:57,52 --> 1:48:0,88
technology - not politics or monetary economics.


2201
1:48:0,88 --> 1:48:5,0
It operates in the same systematic way as, say an airplane


2202
1:48:5,0 --> 1:48:9,36
and there is no Republican or Liberal way to build an airplane.


2203
1:48:9,36 --> 1:48:11,44
Likewise, nature itself is the


2204
1:48:11,44 --> 1:48:14,28
physical referent we use to prove our science


2205
1:48:14,28 --> 1:48:16,2
and it is a set system-


2206
1:48:16,2 --> 1:48:19,56
emerging only from our increased understanding of it.


2207
1:48:19,56 --> 1:48:22,0
In fact, it has no regard for what you


2208
1:48:22,0 --> 1:48:24,6
subjectively think or believe to be true.


2209
1:48:24,6 --> 1:48:26,6
Rather, it gives you an option:


2210
1:48:26,6 --> 1:48:28,68
you can learn and fall in line with its


2211
1:48:28,68 --> 1:48:31,16
natural laws and conduct yourself accordingly-


2212
1:48:31,16 --> 1:48:34,48
invariably creating good health & sustainability...


2213
1:48:34,48 --> 1:48:37,68
or you can go against the current - to no avail.


2214
1:48:37,68 --> 1:48:40,4
It doesn't matter how much you believe you can just


2215
1:48:40,4 --> 1:48:42,44
stand up right now and walk on the wall next to you


2216
1:48:42,44 --> 1:48:44,6
the law of gravity will not allow it.


2217
1:48:44,6 --> 1:48:46,68
If you do not eat - you will die.


2218
1:48:46,68 --> 1:48:49,6
If you are not touched as an infant - you will die.


2219
1:48:49,6 --> 1:48:53,56
As harsh as it may sound, nature is a dictatorship


2220
1:48:53,56 --> 1:48:56,96
and we can either listen to it and come in harmony with it


2221
1:48:56,96 --> 1:49:0,4
or suffer the inevitable adverse consequences.


2222
1:49:0,4 --> 1:49:3,36
So, a Resource-Based Economy is nothing more


2223
1:49:3,36 --> 1:49:6,84
than a set of proven, life supporting understandings


2224
1:49:6,84 --> 1:49:9,32
where all decisions are based upon


2225
1:49:9,32 --> 1:49:12,76
optimized human and environmental sustainability.


2226
1:49:12,76 --> 1:49:16,2
It takes into account the empirical “Life Ground”


2227
1:49:16,2 --> 1:49:18,6
which every human being shares as a need


2228
1:49:18,6 --> 1:49:22,88
regardless, again, of their political or religious philosophy.


2229
1:49:22,88 --> 1:49:26,4
There is no cultural relativism to this approach.


2230
1:49:26,4 --> 1:49:28,72
It isn't a matter of opinion.


2231
1:49:28,72 --> 1:49:30,92
Human needs are human needs


2232
1:49:30,92 --> 1:49:34,6
and having access to the necessities of life, such as clean air


2233
1:49:34,6 --> 1:49:37,12
nutritious food and clean water


2234
1:49:37,12 --> 1:49:40,6
along with a positively reinforcing, stable


2235
1:49:40,6 --> 1:49:44,72
nurturing, non-violent environment, is demanded


2236
1:49:44,72 --> 1:49:47,4
for our mental and physical health


2237
1:49:47,4 --> 1:49:49,4
our evolutionary fitness


2238
1:49:49,4 --> 1:49:52,4
and hence, the species survival itself.


2239
1:49:52,4 --> 1:49:54,88
A Resource-Based Economy


2240
1:49:54,88 --> 1:49:58,28
would be based upon available resources.


2241
1:49:58,28 --> 1:50:1,44
You can't just bring a lot of people to an island


2242
1:50:1,44 --> 1:50:6,72
or build a city of 50,000 people without having access


2243
1:50:6,72 --> 1:50:8,8
to the necessities of life.


2244
1:50:8,8 --> 1:50:13,36
So, when I use the term 'a comprehensive systems approach'


2245
1:50:13,36 --> 1:50:17,64
I'm talking about doing an inventory of the area first


2246
1:50:17,64 --> 1:50:20,96
and determining what that area can supply-


2247
1:50:20,96 --> 1:50:23,48
not just architectural approach-


2248
1:50:23,48 --> 1:50:26,0
not just design approach-


2249
1:50:26,0 --> 1:50:29,6
but design must be based on all of the requirements


2250
1:50:29,6 --> 1:50:31,24
to enhance human life


2251
1:50:31,24 --> 1:50:35,4
and that's what I mean by an integrated way of thinking.


2252
1:50:35,4 --> 1:50:37,88
Food, clothing, shelter, warmth, love -


2253
1:50:37,88 --> 1:50:40,92
All those things are necessary


2254
1:50:40,92 --> 1:50:43,68
and if you deprive people of any of them


2255
1:50:43,68 --> 1:50:49,28
you have a lesser human being, less capable of functioning.


2256
1:50:49,28 --> 1:50:53,12
As previously outlined, a Resource-Based Economy's ground up


2257
1:50:53,12 --> 1:50:57,68
global, systems approach to extraction, production and distribution


2258
1:50:57,68 --> 1:51:2,64
is based upon on a set of true economic mechanisms, or 'strategies'


2259
1:51:2,64 --> 1:51:4,96
which guarantee efficiency and


2260
1:51:4,96 --> 1:51:8,72
sustainability in every area of the economy.


2261
1:51:8,72 --> 1:51:12,44
So, continuing this train of thought regarding logical design-


2262
1:51:12,44 --> 1:51:14,32
what is next in our equation?


2263
1:51:14,32 --> 1:51:16,84
Where does all this materialize?


2264
1:51:16,84 --> 1:51:18,4
Cities.


2265
1:51:18,4 --> 1:51:22,36
The advent of the city is a defining feature of modern civilization.


2266
1:51:22,36 --> 1:51:26,2
Its role is to enable efficient access to the necessities of life


2267
1:51:26,2 --> 1:51:31,2
along with increased social support and community interaction.


2268
1:51:31,2 --> 1:51:34,16
So how would we go about designing an ideal city?


2269
1:51:34,16 --> 1:51:35,72
What shape should we make it?


2270
1:51:35,72 --> 1:51:38,16
Square? Trapezoid?


2271
1:51:38,16 --> 1:51:40,32
Well, given we are going to be moving around the thing


2272
1:51:40,32 --> 1:51:43,56
we might as well make it as equidistant as possible for ease...


2273
1:51:43,56 --> 1:51:45,92
hence the circle.


2274
1:51:45,92 --> 1:51:47,72
What should the city contain?


2275
1:51:47,72 --> 1:51:51,76
Well, naturally we need a residential area, a goods production area


2276
1:51:51,76 --> 1:51:55,68
a power generation area; an agricultural area.


2277
1:51:55,68 --> 1:51:58,84
But we also need nurturing as human beings - hence culture


2278
1:51:58,84 --> 1:52:2,16
nature, recreation and education.


2279
1:52:2,16 --> 1:52:4,2
So lets include a nice open park


2280
1:52:4,2 --> 1:52:8,68
an entertainment/events area for cultural purposes and socializing


2281
1:52:8,68 --> 1:52:11,28
and educational and research facilities.


2282
1:52:11,28 --> 1:52:13,56
And since we are working with a circle


2283
1:52:13,56 --> 1:52:16,48
it seems rational to place these functions in Belts


2284
1:52:16,48 --> 1:52:19,6
based on the amount of land required for each goal


2285
1:52:19,6 --> 1:52:22,0
along with ease of access.


2286
1:52:22,0 --> 1:52:23,56
Very good.


2287
1:52:23,56 --> 1:52:25,76
Now, let's get down to specifics:


2288
1:52:25,76 --> 1:52:27,88
First we need the consider the core


2289
1:52:27,88 --> 1:52:31,16
infrastructure or intestines of the city organism.


2290
1:52:31,16 --> 1:52:33,28
These would be the water, goods


2291
1:52:33,28 --> 1:52:35,68
waste and energy transport channels.


2292
1:52:35,68 --> 1:52:39,52
Just as we have water and sewage systems under our cities today


2293
1:52:39,52 --> 1:52:42,2
we would extend this channeling concept to


2294
1:52:42,2 --> 1:52:45,2
integrate waste recycling and delivery itself.


2295
1:52:45,2 --> 1:52:47,72
No more mailmen or garbage men.


2296
1:52:47,72 --> 1:52:50,44
It is built right in. We could even use


2297
1:52:50,44 --> 1:52:53,56
automated pneumatic tubes and similar technologies.


2298
1:52:53,56 --> 1:52:55,48
Same goes for transport.


2299
1:52:55,48 --> 1:52:59,12
It needs to be integrated and strategically designed to reduce


2300
1:52:59,12 --> 1:53:2,76
or even remove the need for wasteful, independent automobiles.


2301
1:53:2,76 --> 1:53:5,68
Electric trams, conveyors, transveyors and


2302
1:53:5,68 --> 1:53:7,96
maglevs which can take you virtually


2303
1:53:7,96 --> 1:53:10,44
anywhere in the city, even up and down


2304
1:53:10,44 --> 1:53:13,6
along with connecting you to other cities as well.


2305
1:53:13,6 --> 1:53:16,52
And of course, in the event a car is required


2306
1:53:16,52 --> 1:53:20,32
it is automated by satellite for safety and integrity.


2307
1:53:20,32 --> 1:53:24,16
In fact, this automation technology is in working order right now.


2308
1:53:24,16 --> 1:53:29,8
Automobile accidents kill about 1.2 million people every single year;


2309
1:53:29,8 --> 1:53:31,2
injuring about 50 million.


2310
1:53:31,2 --> 1:53:34,16
This is absurd and doesn't have to occur.


2311
1:53:34,16 --> 1:53:37,92
Between efficient city design and automated, driverless cars


2312
1:53:37,92 --> 1:53:41,24
this death toll can be virtually eliminated.


2313
1:53:41,24 --> 1:53:42,72
Agriculture.


2314
1:53:42,72 --> 1:53:46,24
Today, through our haphazard, cost-cutting industrial methods


2315
1:53:46,24 --> 1:53:50,44
using pesticides, excessive fertilizers and other means


2316
1:53:50,44 --> 1:53:52,4
we have successfully destroyed much


2317
1:53:52,4 --> 1:53:54,36
of the the arable land on this planet


2318
1:53:54,36 --> 1:53:57,84
not to mention also extensively poisoning our bodies.


2319
1:53:57,84 --> 1:54:1,16
In fact, industrial and agricultural chemical toxins


2320
1:54:1,16 --> 1:54:7,2
now show up in virtually every human being tested, including infants.


2321
1:54:7,2 --> 1:54:10,16
Fortunately, there is a glaring alternative -


2322
1:54:10,16 --> 1:54:13,64
the soilless mediums of hydroponics and aeroponics


2323
1:54:13,64 --> 1:54:16,56
which also reduce nutrient and water


2324
1:54:16,56 --> 1:54:20,48
requirements by up to 75 % of our current usage.


2325
1:54:20,48 --> 1:54:24,16
Food can now be organically grown on an industrial scale


2326
1:54:24,16 --> 1:54:26,72
in enclosed vertical farms.


2327
1:54:26,72 --> 1:54:29,68
Such as in 50 story 1 acre plots -


2328
1:54:29,68 --> 1:54:32,0
virtually eliminating the need for


2329
1:54:32,0 --> 1:54:34,68
pesticides and hydrocarbons in general.


2330
1:54:34,68 --> 1:54:37,64
This is the future of industrial food cultivation.


2331
1:54:37,64 --> 1:54:40,36
Efficient, clean and abundant.


2332
1:54:40,36 --> 1:54:43,44
So, such advanced systems would be, in part


2333
1:54:43,44 --> 1:54:46,0
what comprise our agricultural belt


2334
1:54:46,0 --> 1:54:49,68
producing all the food required for the entire city's population


2335
1:54:49,68 --> 1:54:52,68
with no need to import anything from the outside


2336
1:54:52,68 --> 1:54:56,44
saving time, waste and energy.


2337
1:54:56,44 --> 1:54:58,4
And speaking of Energy-


2338
1:54:58,4 --> 1:55:1,28
The Energy Belt would work in a systems approach to


2339
1:55:1,28 --> 1:55:4,44
extract electricity from our abundant renewable mediums


2340
1:55:4,44 --> 1:55:8,72
-specifically wind, solar, geothermal and heat differentials


2341
1:55:8,72 --> 1:55:12,68
and if near water potentials - tidal and wave power.


2342
1:55:12,68 --> 1:55:15,0
To avoid intermittency and make sure


2343
1:55:15,0 --> 1:55:17,28
a positive net energy return occurs


2344
1:55:17,28 --> 1:55:20,28
these mediums would operate in an integrated system


2345
1:55:20,28 --> 1:55:22,24
powering each other when needed


2346
1:55:22,24 --> 1:55:24,52
while storing excessive energy to large


2347
1:55:24,52 --> 1:55:26,84
super capacitors under the ground


2348
1:55:26,84 --> 1:55:29,24
so nothing can go to waste.


2349
1:55:29,24 --> 1:55:31,64
And not only does the city power itself


2350
1:55:31,64 --> 1:55:34,92
particular structures will also power independently


2351
1:55:34,92 --> 1:55:38,4
and generate electricity through photovoltaic paints


2352
1:55:38,4 --> 1:55:41,64
structural pressure transducers, the thermocouple effect


2353
1:55:41,64 --> 1:55:45,56
and other current but under utilized technologies.


2354
1:55:45,56 --> 1:55:47,6
But, of course, this begs the question:


2355
1:55:47,6 --> 1:55:49,72
how does this technology, and goods in


2356
1:55:49,72 --> 1:55:52,12
general, get created in the first place?


2357
1:55:52,12 --> 1:55:54,4
This bring us to Production:


2358
1:55:54,4 --> 1:55:57,24
The Industrial Belt, apart from having hospitals and the like


2359
1:55:57,24 --> 1:55:59,64
would be the hub of factory production.


2360
1:55:59,64 --> 1:56:1,44
Completely localized overall


2361
1:56:1,44 --> 1:56:3,84
it would, of course, obtain raw materials by way of


2362
1:56:3,84 --> 1:56:7,52
the global resource management system, just discussed-


2363
1:56:7,52 --> 1:56:12,12
with demand being generated by the population of the city itself.


2364
1:56:12,12 --> 1:56:14,28
As far as the mechanics of production


2365
1:56:14,28 --> 1:56:17,36
we need to discuss a new, powerful phenomenon


2366
1:56:17,36 --> 1:56:20,2
which was sparked very recently in human history


2367
1:56:20,2 --> 1:56:23,52
and is on pace to changing everything.


2368
1:56:23,52 --> 1:56:25,56
It's called Mechanization


2369
1:56:25,56 --> 1:56:28,12
or the automation of labor.


2370
1:56:28,12 --> 1:56:31,28
Well, if you look around, you'll notice that almost


2371
1:56:31,28 --> 1:56:33,92
everything that we use today


2372
1:56:33,92 --> 1:56:37,4
is built automatically.


2373
1:56:37,4 --> 1:56:42,36
Your shoes, your clothes, your home appliances, your car and so on...


2374
1:56:42,36 --> 1:56:48,76
they are all built by machines in an automatic way.


2375
1:56:48,76 --> 1:56:51,88
Can we say that the society has not been


2376
1:56:51,88 --> 1:56:56,8
influenced by these major technological advancements?


2377
1:56:56,8 --> 1:56:57,24
Of course not.


2378
1:56:57,24 --> 1:57:2,44
These systems really dictate new structures


2379
1:57:2,44 --> 1:57:7,88
and new needs and they make a lot of other things obsolete.


2380
1:57:7,88 --> 1:57:12,12
So, we have been going up in the development


2381
1:57:12,12 --> 1:57:16,32
and use of technology in an exponential way.


2382
1:57:16,32 --> 1:57:21,6
So, definitely automation is going to continue. You cannot stop


2383
1:57:21,6 --> 1:57:24,28
technologies that just make sense.


2384
1:57:24,28 --> 1:57:27,72
Labor automation through technology is at the bottom


2385
1:57:27,72 --> 1:57:31,16
of every major social transformation in human history.


2386
1:57:31,16 --> 1:57:34,44
From the agricultural revolution and the invention of the plow


2387
1:57:34,44 --> 1:57:37,88
to the industrial revolution and the invention of the powered machine


2388
1:57:37,88 --> 1:57:40,8
to the information age we live in now through


2389
1:57:40,8 --> 1:57:45,0
essentially the invention of advanced electronics and computers.


2390
1:57:45,0 --> 1:57:48,12
And with regard to advanced production methods today


2391
1:57:48,12 --> 1:57:51,8
mechanization is now evolving on its own.


2392
1:57:51,8 --> 1:57:53,6
Moving away from the traditional method of


2393
1:57:53,6 --> 1:57:56,56
assembling component parts into a configuration -


2394
1:57:56,56 --> 1:57:59,28
into an advanced method of creating


2395
1:57:59,28 --> 1:58:2,2
entire products in one single process.


2396
1:58:2,2 --> 1:58:5,92
Like most engineers, I'm fascinated by biology because it is


2397
1:58:5,92 --> 1:58:10,24
so full of examples of extraordinary pieces of engineering.


2398
1:58:10,24 --> 1:58:16,32
What biology is - is the study of things that copy themselves.


2399
1:58:16,32 --> 1:58:18,48
As good a definition of life as we've got.


2400
1:58:18,48 --> 1:58:20,48
Again, as an engineer, I have always been


2401
1:58:20,48 --> 1:58:23,16
intrigued by the idea of machines copying themselves.


2402
1:58:23,16 --> 1:58:25,68
RepRap is a three-dimensional printer-


2403
1:58:25,68 --> 1:58:29,4
that's to say it is a printer that you plug into your computer and


2404
1:58:29,4 --> 1:58:32,36
instead of making two-dimensional sheets of paper with patterns on


2405
1:58:32,36 --> 1:58:35,56
it makes real, physical, three-dimensional objects.


2406
1:58:35,56 --> 1:58:37,48
Now there's nothing new about that


2407
1:58:37,48 --> 1:58:40,16
3-D printers have been around for about 30 years.


2408
1:58:40,16 --> 1:58:45,4
The big thing about RepRap is that it prints most of its own parts.


2409
1:58:45,4 --> 1:58:46,56
So, if you've got one, you could


2410
1:58:46,56 --> 1:58:48,32
make another one and give it to a friend


2411
1:58:48,32 --> 1:58:51,48
as well as being able to print lots of useful things.


2412
1:58:51,48 --> 1:58:55,4
From the simple printing of basic household goods in your home


2413
1:58:55,4 --> 1:58:58,96
to the printing of an entire automobile body in one swoop


2414
1:58:58,96 --> 1:59:1,56
advanced, automated 3d printing now has the


2415
1:59:1,56 --> 1:59:5,16
potential to transform virtually every field of production.


2416
1:59:5,16 --> 1:59:7,56
Including home construction.


2417
1:59:7,56 --> 1:59:10,16
Contour Crafting is


2418
1:59:10,16 --> 1:59:13,0
actually a fabrication technology-


2419
1:59:13,0 --> 1:59:16,88
the so-called 3-D printing- when you directly build


2420
1:59:16,88 --> 1:59:20,68
3-D objects from a computer model.


2421
1:59:20,68 --> 1:59:23,84
Using Contour Crafting, it will be possible


2422
1:59:23,84 --> 1:59:26,92
to build a 2000 square-foot home


2423
1:59:26,92 --> 1:59:31,2
entirely by the machine, in one day.


2424
1:59:31,2 --> 1:59:36,32
The reason that people are interested in automating construction


2425
1:59:36,32 --> 1:59:39,12
is that it really brings a lot of benefits.


2426
1:59:39,12 --> 1:59:43,36
For example, construction is pretty labor-intensive


2427
1:59:43,36 --> 1:59:49,64
and although it provides jobs for a sector of the society


2428
1:59:49,64 --> 1:59:54,76
it also has issues and complications.


2429
1:59:54,76 --> 1:59:59,68
For example, construction is the most dangerous job that there is.


2430
1:59:59,68 --> 2:0:2,6
It is worse than mining and agriculture.


2431
2:0:2,6 --> 2:0:7,52
That has the highest level of fatality in almost every country.


2432
2:0:7,52 --> 2:0:10,24
Another issue is the waste.


2433
2:0:10,24 --> 2:0:15,52
An average home in the United States has 3 to 7 tons of waste.


2434
2:0:15,52 --> 2:0:21,36
So this is huge if we look at the impact of construction


2435
2:0:21,36 --> 2:0:24,68
and knowing about 40% of all materials


2436
2:0:24,68 --> 2:0:27,88
in the world are used in construction.


2437
2:0:27,88 --> 2:0:31,0
So, a big waste of energy and resources


2438
2:0:31,0 --> 2:0:34,44
and big damage to the environment as well.


2439
2:0:34,44 --> 2:0:39,4
Making homes using hammers and nails and wood


2440
2:0:39,4 --> 2:0:43,68
with the state of our technology today, is really absurd


2441
2:0:43,68 --> 2:0:47,0
and will go the way of our labor class in


2442
2:0:47,0 --> 2:0:50,52
regards to manufacturing in the United States.


2443
2:0:50,52 --> 2:0:56,36
Recently, there was a study by economist David Autor of MIT


2444
2:0:56,36 --> 2:1:0,28
that states that our middle class is obsolete


2445
2:1:0,28 --> 2:1:3,68
and being replaced by automation.


2446
2:1:3,68 --> 2:1:6,92
Quite simply, Mechanization is more productive


2447
2:1:6,92 --> 2:1:9,88
efficient and sustainable than human labor


2448
2:1:9,88 --> 2:1:13,0
in virtually every sector of the economy today.


2449
2:1:13,0 --> 2:1:16,6
Machines do not need vacations, breaks, insurance, pensions


2450
2:1:16,6 --> 2:1:19,6
and they can work 24 hours a day, everyday.


2451
2:1:19,6 --> 2:1:22,2
The output potential and accuracy


2452
2:1:22,2 --> 2:1:25,6
compared to human labor, is unmatched.


2453
2:1:25,6 --> 2:1:29,28
The bottom line: repetitive human labor is becoming obsolete


2454
2:1:29,28 --> 2:1:31,48
and impractical across the world


2455
2:1:31,48 --> 2:1:34,24
and the unemployment you see around you today


2456
2:1:34,24 --> 2:1:36,8
is fundamentally the result of this


2457
2:1:36,8 --> 2:1:40,4
evolution of efficiency in technology.


2458
2:1:40,4 --> 2:1:43,76
For years, market economists have dismissed this growing pattern


2459
2:1:43,76 --> 2:1:47,0
which could be called “Technological Unemployment”


2460
2:1:47,0 --> 2:1:49,84
because of the fact that new sectors always seemed


2461
2:1:49,84 --> 2:1:52,88
to emerge to re-absorb the displaced workers.


2462
2:1:52,88 --> 2:1:56,12
Today, the service sector is the only real hub left


2463
2:1:56,12 --> 2:1:59,84
and currently employs over 80% of the American workforce


2464
2:1:59,84 --> 2:2:4,4
with most industrialized countries maintaining a similar proportion.


2465
2:2:4,4 --> 2:2:6,16
However, this sector now being


2466
2:2:6,16 --> 2:2:9,24
challenged increasingly by automated kiosks-


2467
2:2:9,24 --> 2:2:13,8
automated restaurants and even automated stores.


2468
2:2:13,8 --> 2:2:14,8
Economists today are finally


2469
2:2:14,8 --> 2:2:17,48
acknowledging what they had been denying for years:


2470
2:2:17,48 --> 2:2:21,48
not only is technological unemployment exasperating the current


2471
2:2:21,48 --> 2:2:23,48
labor crisis we see across the


2472
2:2:23,48 --> 2:2:26,24
world due to the global economic downturn


2473
2:2:26,24 --> 2:2:28,48
but the more the recession deepens


2474
2:2:28,48 --> 2:2:31,16
the faster the industries are mechanizing.


2475
2:2:31,16 --> 2:2:33,12
The catch, which is not realized


2476
2:2:33,12 --> 2:2:36,0
is that the faster they mechanize to save money;


2477
2:2:36,0 --> 2:2:37,76
the more they displace people-


2478
2:2:37,76 --> 2:2:41,0
the more they reduce public purchasing power.


2479
2:2:41,0 --> 2:2:42,88
This means that, while the corporation


2480
2:2:42,88 --> 2:2:44,72
can produce everything more cheaply


2481
2:2:44,72 --> 2:2:48,4
fewer and fewer people will actually have money to buy anything


2482
2:2:48,4 --> 2:2:51,4
regardless of how cheap they become.


2483
2:2:51,4 --> 2:2:53,8
The bottom line is that the “labor for


2484
2:2:53,8 --> 2:2:56,76
income” game is slowly coming to an end.


2485
2:2:56,76 --> 2:2:59,2
In fact, if you take a moment to reflect


2486
2:2:59,2 --> 2:3:1,6
on the jobs which are in existence today


2487
2:3:1,6 --> 2:3:5,52
which automation could take over right now, if applied


2488
2:3:5,52 --> 2:3:8,4
75% of the global workforce could be


2489
2:3:8,4 --> 2:3:11,56
replaced by mechanization tomorrow.


2490
2:3:11,56 --> 2:3:14,88
And this is why, in a Resource-Based Economy


2491
2:3:14,88 --> 2:3:17,64
There is no Monetary-Market system.


2492
2:3:17,64 --> 2:3:19,88
No money at all...


2493
2:3:19,88 --> 2:3:21,4
for there is no need.


2494
2:3:21,4 --> 2:3:23,8
a Resource-Based Economy


2495
2:3:23,8 --> 2:3:25,84
recognizes the efficiency of mechanization


2496
2:3:25,84 --> 2:3:27,8
and accepts it for what it offers.


2497
2:3:27,8 --> 2:3:30,56
It doesn't fight it, like we do today.


2498
2:3:30,56 --> 2:3:33,12
Why? Because it is irresponsible not to


2499
2:3:33,12 --> 2:3:38,24
given any interest in efficiency and sustainability.


2500
2:3:38,24 --> 2:3:41,16
And this brings us back to our city system.


2501
2:3:41,16 --> 2:3:43,32
In the center is the Central Dome


2502
2:3:43,32 --> 2:3:45,4
which not only houses the


2503
2:3:45,4 --> 2:3:47,64
educational facilities and transportation hub-


2504
2:3:47,64 --> 2:3:49,84
it also hosts the mainframe that


2505
2:3:49,84 --> 2:3:52,4
runs the cities technical operations.


2506
2:3:52,4 --> 2:3:55,76
The city is, in fact, one big automated machine.


2507
2:3:55,76 --> 2:3:57,76
It has sensors in all technical belts


2508
2:3:57,76 --> 2:3:59,8
to track the progress of architecture-


2509
2:3:59,8 --> 2:4:4,12
energy gathering, production, distribution and the like.


2510
2:4:4,12 --> 2:4:6,64
Now, would people be needed to oversee these


2511
2:4:6,64 --> 2:4:9,6
operations in the event of a malfunction and the like?


2512
2:4:9,6 --> 2:4:11,4
Most probably: yes.


2513
2:4:11,4 --> 2:4:12,96
But that number would decrease


2514
2:4:12,96 --> 2:4:15,24
over time as improvements continue.


2515
2:4:15,24 --> 2:4:17,32
However, as of today, maybe 3% of


2516
2:4:17,32 --> 2:4:19,52
the city population would be needed


2517
2:4:19,52 --> 2:4:22,0
for this job when you break it down.


2518
2:4:22,0 --> 2:4:24,24
And I can assure you:


2519
2:4:24,24 --> 2:4:26,28
that in an economic system which is


2520
2:4:26,28 --> 2:4:28,52
actually designed to take care of you


2521
2:4:28,52 --> 2:4:30,68
and secure your well being


2522
2:4:30,68 --> 2:4:32,72
without you having to submit to


2523
2:4:32,72 --> 2:4:35,32
private dictatorship on a daily basis...


2524
2:4:35,32 --> 2:4:37,64
usually to a job that is either


2525
2:4:37,64 --> 2:4:40,6
technically unnecessary or socially pointless


2526
2:4:40,6 --> 2:4:43,64
while often struggling with debt that doesn't exist


2527
2:4:43,64 --> 2:4:45,8
just to make ends meet...


2528
2:4:45,8 --> 2:4:50,44
I guarantee you: people will volunteer their time left and right


2529
2:4:50,44 --> 2:4:53,16
to maintain and improve a system


2530
2:4:53,16 --> 2:4:57,8
that actually takes care of them.


2531
2:4:57,8 --> 2:5:0,28
And coupled with this issue of 'Incentive'-


2532
2:5:0,28 --> 2:5:2,2
comes the common assumption that


2533
2:5:2,2 --> 2:5:4,28
if there isn't some external pressure


2534
2:5:4,28 --> 2:5:6,76
for one to “work for a living”


2535
2:5:6,76 --> 2:5:9,32
people would just sit around, do nothing


2536
2:5:9,32 --> 2:5:12,16
and turn into fat lazy blobs.


2537
2:5:12,16 --> 2:5:14,48
This is nonsense.


2538
2:5:14,48 --> 2:5:16,8
The labor system we have today is


2539
2:5:16,8 --> 2:5:19,2
in fact the generator of laziness-


2540
2:5:19,2 --> 2:5:22,8
not a resolver of it.


2541
2:5:22,8 --> 2:5:24,28
If you think back to when you were a child-


2542
2:5:24,28 --> 2:5:27,4
full of life, interested in new things to understand-


2543
2:5:27,4 --> 2:5:29,8
likely creating and exploring...


2544
2:5:29,8 --> 2:5:32,76
but as time went on, the system pushed you


2545
2:5:32,76 --> 2:5:36,28
into the focus of figuring out how to make money.


2546
2:5:36,28 --> 2:5:37,96
And from early education


2547
2:5:37,96 --> 2:5:40,8
to study at a university, you are narrowed.


2548
2:5:40,8 --> 2:5:43,64
Only to emerge as a creature which serves


2549
2:5:43,64 --> 2:5:46,2
as a cog in a wheel in a model that


2550
2:5:46,2 --> 2:5:49,2
sends all the fruits to the upper 1%.


2551
2:5:49,2 --> 2:5:52,44
Scientific Studies have now shown that people are, in fact


2552
2:5:52,44 --> 2:5:55,12
not motivated by monetary reward


2553
2:5:55,12 --> 2:5:57,8
when it comes to ingenuity and creation.


2554
2:5:57,8 --> 2:6:0,68
The creation itself is the reward.


2555
2:6:0,68 --> 2:6:3,6
Money, in fact, appears only to serve as an incentive


2556
2:6:3,6 --> 2:6:6,24
for repetitive, mundane actions-


2557
2:6:6,24 --> 2:6:10,44
a role we have just now shown can be replaced by machine.


2558
2:6:10,44 --> 2:6:12,36
When it comes to innovation


2559
2:6:12,36 --> 2:6:14,76
the actual use of the human mind


2560
2:6:14,76 --> 2:6:17,6
the monetary incentive has proven to be a hindrance


2561
2:6:17,6 --> 2:6:21,2
interfering and detracting from creative thought.


2562
2:6:21,2 --> 2:6:24,32
And this might explain why Nikola Tesla, the Wright Brothers


2563
2:6:24,32 --> 2:6:26,84
and other inventors who contributed massively


2564
2:6:26,84 --> 2:6:28,2
to our current world


2565
2:6:28,2 --> 2:6:31,68
never showed a monetary incentive to do so.


2566
2:6:31,68 --> 2:6:35,36
Money is, in fact, a false incentive


2567
2:6:35,36 --> 2:6:38,12
and causes 100 times more distortion


2568
2:6:38,12 --> 2:6:42,12
than it does contribution.


2569
2:6:42,12 --> 2:6:44,8
Good morning class. Please settle down.


2570
2:6:44,8 --> 2:6:48,0
The first thing I would like to do is go around the room


2571
2:6:48,0 --> 2:6:51,76
and ask what everyone would like to be when they grow up.


2572
2:6:51,76 --> 2:6:54,4
Who would like to go first?


2573
2:6:54,4 --> 2:6:56,44
Okay, how about you Sarah?


2574
2:6:56,44 --> 2:7:0,92
When I grow up I want to work at McDonald's like my mom!


2575
2:7:0,92 --> 2:7:3,68
Oh, family tradition, eh?


2576
2:7:3,68 --> 2:7:5,76
How about you, Linda?


2577
2:7:5,76 --> 2:7:8,8
When I grow up, I'm going to be a


2578
2:7:8,8 --> 2:7:11,16
prostitute on the streets of New York City!


2579
2:7:11,16 --> 2:7:13,16
Oh! glamour girl, huh?


2580
2:7:13,16 --> 2:7:15,12
Very ambitious.


2581
2:7:15,12 --> 2:7:16,92
How about you, Tommy?


2582
2:7:16,92 --> 2:7:19,0
When I grow up, I'm going to be a


2583
2:7:19,0 --> 2:7:21,8
rich, elitist businessman who works


2584
2:7:21,8 --> 2:7:23,12
on Wall Street and profits off of


2585
2:7:23,12 --> 2:7:25,2
the collapse of foreign economies.


2586
2:7:25,2 --> 2:7:26,48
Enterprising...


2587
2:7:26,48 --> 2:7:32,24
And great to see some multicultural interest!


2588
2:7:32,24 --> 2:7:33,76
[Victims of Culture]


2589
2:7:33,76 --> 2:7:36,8
As stated before, a Resource-Based


2590
2:7:36,8 --> 2:7:40,8
Economy applies the Scientific Method to social concern


2591
2:7:40,8 --> 2:7:43,52
and this isn't limited to simply technical efficiency.


2592
2:7:43,52 --> 2:7:45,56
It also has the consideration of


2593
2:7:45,56 --> 2:7:49,6
human and social well-being directly and what comprises it.


2594
2:7:49,6 --> 2:7:52,48
What good is a social system if, in the end


2595
2:7:52,48 --> 2:7:55,96
it doesn't produce happiness and peaceful coexistence?


2596
2:7:55,96 --> 2:7:58,8
So, it is important to point out that


2597
2:7:58,8 --> 2:8:0,8
with the removal of the money system


2598
2:8:0,8 --> 2:8:2,56
and the necessities of life provided


2599
2:8:2,56 --> 2:8:5,8
we would see a global reduction in


2600
2:8:5,8 --> 2:8:8,24
crime by about 95% almost immediately


2601
2:8:8,24 --> 2:8:12,4
for there is nothing to steal, embezzle, scam, or the like.


2602
2:8:12,4 --> 2:8:14,96
95% of all people in prisons today are there


2603
2:8:14,96 --> 2:8:18,4
due to some monetary related crime or drug abuse


2604
2:8:18,4 --> 2:8:23,32
and drug abuse is a disorder - not a crime.


2605
2:8:23,32 --> 2:8:25,24
So what about the other 5%?


2606
2:8:25,24 --> 2:8:27,4
the truly violent...


2607
2:8:27,4 --> 2:8:28,88
often seeming to some as being


2608
2:8:28,88 --> 2:8:31,24
violent for the sake of being violent...


2609
2:8:31,24 --> 2:8:35,8
are they just “evil” people?


2610
2:8:35,8 --> 2:8:40,44
The reason that I frankly think it's a waste of time


2611
2:8:40,44 --> 2:8:43,84
to engage in moral value judgments


2612
2:8:43,84 --> 2:8:46,56
about people's violence is


2613
2:8:46,56 --> 2:8:50,48
because it doesn't advance by one iota


2614
2:8:50,48 --> 2:8:53,68
our understanding of either the causes


2615
2:8:53,68 --> 2:8:57,76
or the prevention of the violent behavior.


2616
2:8:57,76 --> 2:9:2,36
People sometimes ask if I believe in “forgiving” criminals.


2617
2:9:2,36 --> 2:9:4,32
My answer to that is


2618
2:9:4,32 --> 2:9:7,24
“No, I don't believe in forgiveness


2619
2:9:7,24 --> 2:9:10,24
anymore than I believe in condemnation”.


2620
2:9:10,24 --> 2:9:13,0
It's only if we, as a society


2621
2:9:13,0 --> 2:9:16,36
can take the same attitude of treating violence as


2622
2:9:16,36 --> 2:9:19,76
a problem in public health and preventive medicine


2623
2:9:19,76 --> 2:9:22,88
rather than as a moral "evil"...


2624
2:9:22,88 --> 2:9:25,6
it's only when we make that change in our


2625
2:9:25,6 --> 2:9:28,32
own attitudes and assumptions and values


2626
2:9:28,32 --> 2:9:31,52
that we will actually succeed in reducing the


2627
2:9:31,52 --> 2:9:34,68
level of violence rather than stimulating it-


2628
2:9:34,68 --> 2:9:36,96
which is what we do now.


2629
2:9:36,96 --> 2:9:39,96
The more justice you seek, the more hurt you become


2630
2:9:39,96 --> 2:9:41,96
because there's no such thing as justice.


2631
2:9:41,96 --> 2:9:46,16
There is whatever there is out there. That's it.


2632
2:9:46,16 --> 2:9:50,8
In other words, if people are conditioned to be racist bigots-


2633
2:9:50,8 --> 2:9:53,2
if they are brought up in an environment that advocates that


2634
2:9:53,2 --> 2:9:55,0
why do you blame the person for it?


2635
2:9:55,0 --> 2:9:58,24
They are a victim of a subculture.


2636
2:9:58,24 --> 2:10:0,28
Therefore they have to be helped.


2637
2:10:0,28 --> 2:10:3,68
The point is, we have to redesign the environment


2638
2:10:3,68 --> 2:10:6,24
that produces aberrant behavior.


2639
2:10:6,24 --> 2:10:7,4
That's the problem.


2640
2:10:7,4 --> 2:10:9,6
Not putting a person in jail.


2641
2:10:9,6 --> 2:10:12,52
That's why judges- lawyers-


2642
2:10:12,52 --> 2:10:15,24
“freedom of choice” - such concepts


2643
2:10:15,24 --> 2:10:19,72
are dangerous, because it gives you mis-information.


2644
2:10:19,72 --> 2:10:23,44
That the person is “bad”... or that person is a “serial killer”.


2645
2:10:23,44 --> 2:10:25,24
Serial killers are made


2646
2:10:25,24 --> 2:10:30,28
just like soldiers become serial killers with a machine gun.


2647
2:10:30,28 --> 2:10:32,8
They become killing machines, but nobody


2648
2:10:32,8 --> 2:10:35,36
looks at them as murderers or assassins


2649
2:10:35,36 --> 2:10:37,44
because that's “natural”.


2650
2:10:37,44 --> 2:10:39,24
So we blame people.


2651
2:10:39,24 --> 2:10:42,2
We say, “Well, this guy was a Nazi - he tortured Jews”.


2652
2:10:42,2 --> 2:10:45,32
No, he was brought up to torture Jews.


2653
2:10:45,32 --> 2:10:47,92
Once you accept the fact that people


2654
2:10:47,92 --> 2:10:50,76
have individual choices and they are free


2655
2:10:50,76 --> 2:10:53,28
to make those choices... Free to make


2656
2:10:53,28 --> 2:10:55,84
choices means without being influenced


2657
2:10:55,84 --> 2:10:58,2
and I can't understand that at all.


2658
2:10:58,2 --> 2:11:2,0
All of us are influenced in all of our choices


2659
2:11:2,0 --> 2:11:5,4
by the culture we live in, by our parents


2660
2:11:5,4 --> 2:11:7,24
and by the values that dominate.


2661
2:11:7,24 --> 2:11:10,92
So, we're influenced- so there can't be “free” choices.


2662
2:11:10,92 --> 2:11:13,52
What's the greatest country in the world?' - the true answer:


2663
2:11:13,52 --> 2:11:16,12
I haven't been all over the world and I don't know


2664
2:11:16,12 --> 2:11:20,2

they have been influenced by their culture.

People ask if I'm a Socialist or a Communist or Capitalist


2708
2:13:38,24 --> 2:13:40,56
I say I am none of the above. Why do you


2709
2:13:40,56 --> 2:13:42,84
think that those are the only options?


2710
2:13:42,84 --> 2:13:44,96
All of those political constructs


2711
2:13:44,96 --> 2:13:47,2
were created by writers who assumed


2712
2:13:47,2 --> 2:13:50,8
we lived on a planet of infinite resources.

2:14:1,0 --> 2:14:3,72
are part of social evolution.

You can't take a giant step


2718

from one culture to another-

2:14:7,96 --> 2:14:9,8
there are in-between systems.

2:14:9,8 --> 2:14:11,92

no life, in any culture, can do without.

So we've got to reset down to the Life Ground


2730
2:14:34,88 --> 2:14:37,6
and the life ground is no longer any “Ism”.

[Beyond The Pale]


2733
2:14:43,68 --> 2:14:46,2
It's simply a matter of historical fact


2734
2:14:46,2 --> 2:14:48,64
that the dominant intellectual culture


2735
2:14:48,64 --> 2:14:50,96
of any particular society reflects the


2736
2:14:50,96 --> 2:14:54,0
interests of the dominant group in that society.


2737
2:14:54,0 --> 2:14:56,0
In a slave owning society


2738
2:14:56,0 --> 2:14:59,12
the beliefs about human beings and human rights


2739
2:14:59,12 --> 2:15:2,6
and so on will reflect the needs of the slave owners.


2740
2:15:2,6 --> 2:15:5,4
In the society, again, which is based on


2741
2:15:5,4 --> 2:15:10,52
the power of certain people to control and profit from


2742
2:15:10,52 --> 2:15:13,76
the lives and work of millions of others


2743
2:15:13,76 --> 2:15:16,12
the dominant intellectual culture will


2744
2:15:16,12 --> 2:15:18,6
reflect the needs of the dominant group.


2745
2:15:18,6 --> 2:15:22,2
So, if you look across the board, the


2746
2:15:22,2 --> 2:15:25,24
ideas that pervade psychology and


2747
2:15:25,24 --> 2:15:28,24

2749
2:15:30,88 --> 2:15:34,6
fundamentally reflect certain elite interests.


2750
2:15:34,6 --> 2:15:38,32
And the academics who question that too much


2751
2:15:38,32 --> 2:15:41,4
tend to get shunted to the side or


2752
2:15:41,4 --> 2:15:43,68
to be seen as sort of “radicals”.


2753
2:15:43,68 --> 2:15:45,76
The dominant values of a culture


2754
2:15:45,76 --> 2:15:47,84
tend to support and perpetuate


2755
2:15:47,84 --> 2:15:50,12
what is rewarded by that culture.


2756
2:15:50,12 --> 2:15:52,24
And in a society where success and


2757
2:15:52,24 --> 2:15:54,64
status is measured by material wealth


2758
2:15:54,64 --> 2:15:56,84
- not social contribution -


2759
2:15:56,84 --> 2:16:1,56
it is easy to see why the state of the world is what it is today.


2760
2:16:1,56 --> 2:16:4,4
We are dealing with a value system disorder


2761
2:16:4,4 --> 2:16:6,2
- completely denatured -


2762
2:16:6,2 --> 2:16:8,84
where the priority of personal and social health


2763
2:16:8,84 --> 2:16:11,6
have become secondary to the detrimental


2764
2:16:11,6 --> 2:16:15,8
notions of artificial wealth and limitless growth.


2765
2:16:15,8 --> 2:16:17,44

And built into its structure


2769

2:16:40,12 --> 2:16:42,52

2779
2:16:55,24 --> 2:16:57,16
to consider, perhaps - I don't know-

2781
2:16:59,16 --> 2:17:1,4
you're just a “Utopianist”.


2782
2:17:1,4 --> 2:17:3,64
And the most insidious of them all:


2783
2:17:3,64 --> 2:17:6,4
if you are not for the "free-market"


2784
2:17:6,4 --> 2:17:8,84
you must be against freedom itself.


2785
2:17:8,84 --> 2:17:11,4
I'm a believer in freedom!


2786
2:17:11,4 --> 2:17:12,8
Every time you hear the word freedom


2787
2:17:12,8 --> 2:17:15,0
being said anywhere or government interference


2788
2:17:15,0 --> 2:17:19,72
said anywhere, it means, decoded:


2789
2:17:19,72 --> 2:17:23,32
blocking maximization of turning money


2790
2:17:23,32 --> 2:17:27,56
into more money for private money possessors.


2791
2:17:27,56 --> 2:17:29,52
That's it. Every other thing they'll say:


2792
2:17:29,52 --> 2:17:31,48
'Oh, we need more commodities for people';


2793
2:17:31,48 --> 2:17:35,64
'Oh, this is freedom against tyranny' and so forth


2794
2:17:35,64 --> 2:17:38,36
every time you see it, you can decode it down to


2795
2:17:38,36 --> 2:17:41,2
that and I think you'll find a one-to-one correlation


2796
2:17:41,2 --> 2:17:42,64
with every time they use it.


2797
2:17:42,64 --> 2:17:45,68
And this, in a sense, we might call:


2798
2:17:45,68 --> 2:17:50,68
a Syntax. A governing syntax of understanding and of value.


2799
2:17:50,68 --> 2:17:53,8
So, it governs beneath their own recognition of it


2800
2:17:53,8 --> 2:17:56,24
so they might say: 'Oh, I didn't mean that at all!'


2801
2:17:56,24 --> 2:17:58,16
but in fact, that's what they do.


2802
2:17:58,16 --> 2:18:0,2
Just like you may speak a grammar


2803
2:18:0,2 --> 2:18:2,28
and you have rules of grammar you follow


2804
2:18:2,28 --> 2:18:4,36
without recognizing what the rules are...


2805
2:18:4,36 --> 2:18:8,4
and so what we have is what I call the “Ruling Value Syntax”


2806
2:18:8,4 --> 2:18:11,72
that underlies this. So, every time they use these words:


2807
2:18:11,72 --> 2:18:15,2
government interference'; 'lack of freedom' or 'freedom'


2808
2:18:15,2 --> 2:18:17,8
or 'progress' or 'development'


2809
2:18:17,8 --> 2:18:22,96
you can decode them all to come back to mean that.


2810
2:18:22,96 --> 2:18:25,64
Of course, when you hear the word 'freedom'


2811
2:18:25,64 --> 2:18:27,8
it tends to be in same sentence


2812
2:18:27,8 --> 2:18:30,24
with something called 'democracy'.


2813
2:18:30,24 --> 2:18:33,16
It's fascinating how people today seem to believe


2814
2:18:33,16 --> 2:18:35,32
that they actually have a relevant


2815
2:18:35,32 --> 2:18:37,68
influence on what their government does


2816
2:18:37,68 --> 2:18:40,2
forgetting that the very nature of


2817
2:18:40,2 --> 2:18:42,88
our system offers everything for sale.


2818
2:18:42,88 --> 2:18:45,68
The only vote that counts is the monetary vote


2819
2:18:45,68 --> 2:18:47,8
and it doesn't matter how much any


2820
2:18:47,8 --> 2:18:50,68
activist yells about ethics and accountability.


2821
2:18:50,68 --> 2:18:54,72
In a market system, every politician, every legislation


2822
2:18:54,72 --> 2:18:58,0
and hence, every government is for sale.


2823
2:18:58,0 --> 2:19:1,52
And even with the 20 trillion dollar bank bailouts


2824
2:19:1,52 --> 2:19:3,64
starting in 2007


2825
2:19:3,64 --> 2:19:6,4
an amount of money which could have changed


2826
2:19:6,4 --> 2:19:8,64
say, the global energy infrastructure


2827
2:19:8,64 --> 2:19:10,44
to fully renewable methods


2828
2:19:10,44 --> 2:19:12,76
instead going to a series of institutions


2829
2:19:12,76 --> 2:19:15,0
that literally do nothing to help society


2830
2:19:15,0 --> 2:19:16,88
institutions that could be


2831
2:19:16,88 --> 2:19:19,6
removed tomorrow with no recourse...


2832
2:19:19,6 --> 2:19:22,48
the blind conditioning that politics and


2833
2:19:22,48 --> 2:19:28,0
politicians exist for the public well-being still continues.


2834
2:19:28,0 --> 2:19:31,12
The fact is, politics is a business


2835
2:19:31,12 --> 2:19:34,8
- no different than any other in a market system


2836
2:19:34,8 --> 2:19:38,4
and they care about their self-interest before anything else.


2837
2:19:38,4 --> 2:19:42,68
I don't really, honestly, deep down believe in political action.


2838
2:19:42,68 --> 2:19:45,92
I think the system contracts and expands as it wants to.


2839
2:19:45,92 --> 2:19:47,72
It accommodates these changes.


2840
2:19:47,72 --> 2:19:50,2
I think the civil rights movement was an accommodation


2841
2:19:50,2 --> 2:19:52,28
on the part of those who own the country.


2842
2:19:52,28 --> 2:19:55,12
I think they see where their self-interest lies;


2843
2:19:55,12 --> 2:19:57,88
they see a certain amount of freedom seems good


2844
2:19:57,88 --> 2:20:1,8
-an illusion of liberty- give these people a voting day every year


2845
2:20:1,8 --> 2:20:4,12
so that they will have the illusion of meaningless choice.


2846
2:20:4,12 --> 2:20:7,56
Meaningless choice- that we go, like slaves and say


2847
2:20:7,56 --> 2:20:11,8
“Oh, I Voted.” The limits of debate in this country are established


2848
2:20:11,8 --> 2:20:13,4
before the debate even begins and everyone


2849
2:20:13,4 --> 2:20:15,4
else is marginalized and made to seem either


2850
2:20:15,4 --> 2:20:17,76
to be communist or some sort of disloyal person


2851
2:20:17,76 --> 2:20:19,56
-a “kook”- there's a word...


2852
2:20:19,56 --> 2:20:21,88
and now it's “conspiracy”. See- they made that.


2853
2:20:21,88 --> 2:20:24,92
Something that should not be even entertained for a minute:


2854
2:20:24,92 --> 2:20:28,8
that powerful people might get together and have a plan!


2855
2:20:28,8 --> 2:20:33,64
Doesn't happen! You're a “kook”! Your a “conspiracy buff”!


2856
2:20:33,64 --> 2:20:37,12
And of all the mechanisms of defense of this system


2857
2:20:37,12 --> 2:20:40,12
there are two that repeatedly come up.


2858
2:20:40,12 --> 2:20:43,72
The first is this idea that the system has been the “cause”


2859
2:20:43,72 --> 2:20:47,12
of the material progress we have seen on this planet.


2860
2:20:47,12 --> 2:20:49,16
Well...No.


2861
2:20:49,16 --> 2:20:51,8
There are basically two root causes which


2862
2:20:51,8 --> 2:20:54,68
have created the increased so-called “wealth”


2863
2:20:54,68 --> 2:20:57,52
and population growth we see today.


2864
2:20:57,52 --> 2:21:1,44
One: the exponential advancement of production technology;


2865
2:21:1,44 --> 2:21:3,96
hence scientific ingenuity.


2866
2:21:3,96 --> 2:21:8,84
And Two: the initial discovery of abundant hydrocarbon energy


2867
2:21:8,84 --> 2:21:13,48
-which is currently the foundation of the entire socio-economic system.


2868
2:21:13,48 --> 2:21:15,44
The free-market / capitalist / monetary


2869
2:21:15,44 --> 2:21:17,6
market system - whatever you want to call it -


2870
2:21:17,6 --> 2:21:21,2
has done nothing but ride the wave of these advents


2871
2:21:21,2 --> 2:21:24,72
with a distorted incentive system and a haphazard


2872
2:21:24,72 --> 2:21:30,44
grossly unequal method of utilizing and distributing those fruits.


2873
2:21:30,44 --> 2:21:33,84
The second defense is a belligerent social bias


2874
2:21:33,84 --> 2:21:36,24
generated from years of propaganda


2875
2:21:36,24 --> 2:21:38,8
which sees any other social system


2876
2:21:38,8 --> 2:21:41,32
as a route to so called "tyranny”


2877
2:21:41,32 --> 2:21:44,88
with various name droppings of Stalin, Mao, Hitler...


2878
2:21:44,88 --> 2:21:47,12
and the death tolls they generated.


2879
2:21:47,12 --> 2:21:50,16
Well, as despotic as these men might have been


2880
2:21:50,16 --> 2:21:53,6
along with the societal approaches they perpetuated...


2881
2:21:53,6 --> 2:21:55,8
when it comes to the game of death


2882
2:21:55,8 --> 2:21:57,92
- when comes to the systematic


2883
2:21:57,92 --> 2:22:0,24
daily mass murder of human beings -


2884
2:22:0,24 --> 2:22:4,92
Nothing in history compares to what we have today.


2885
2:22:4,92 --> 2:22:10,32
Famines - throughout at least the last century of our history


2886
2:22:10,32 --> 2:22:12,92
have not been caused by a lack of food.


2887
2:22:12,92 --> 2:22:16,12
They have been caused by relative poverty.


2888
2:22:16,12 --> 2:22:20,48
The economic resources were so inequitably distributed


2889
2:22:20,48 --> 2:22:23,76
that the poor simply didn't have enough money


2890
2:22:23,76 --> 2:22:26,4
with which to buy the food that would've been


2891
2:22:26,4 --> 2:22:29,56
available if they could have afforded to pay for it.


2892
2:22:29,56 --> 2:22:32,36
That would be an example of Structural Violence.


2893
2:22:32,36 --> 2:22:36,96
Another example: in Africa and other areas-


2894
2:22:36,96 --> 2:22:39,56
I'll particularly focus on Africa-


2895
2:22:39,56 --> 2:22:42,64
tens of millions of people are dying of AIDS.


2896
2:22:42,64 --> 2:22:44,64
Why are they dying?


2897
2:22:44,64 --> 2:22:47,32
It's not because we don't know how to treat AIDS.


2898
2:22:47,32 --> 2:22:51,28
We have millions of people in the wealthy countries


2899
2:22:51,28 --> 2:22:54,84
getting along remarkably well because


2900
2:22:54,84 --> 2:22:57,16
they have the medicines that will treat it.


2901
2:22:57,16 --> 2:23:0,16
The people in Africa who are dying of AIDS


2902
2:23:0,16 --> 2:23:3,8
are not dying because of the HIV virus...


2903
2:23:3,8 --> 2:23:6,0
they are dying because they don't have the money with


2904
2:23:6,0 --> 2:23:9,12
which to pay for the drugs that would keep them alive.


2905
2:23:9,12 --> 2:23:11,4
Gandhi saw this. He said:


2906
2:23:11,4 --> 2:23:16,24
“The deadliest form of violence is poverty.”


2907
2:23:16,24 --> 2:23:18,8
And that's absolutely right.


2908
2:23:18,8 --> 2:23:23,8
Poverty kills far more people than all the wars in history;


2909
2:23:23,8 --> 2:23:25,52
more people than all the murderers in history;


2910
2:23:25,52 --> 2:23:28,56
more than all the suicides in history...


2911
2:23:28,56 --> 2:23:32,16
not only does Structural Violence kill more people


2912
2:23:32,16 --> 2:23:35,36
than all the behavioral violence put together


2913
2:23:35,36 --> 2:23:38,16
Structural Violence is also the


2914
2:23:38,16 --> 2:23:42,84
main cause of behavioral violence.


2915
2:23:42,84 --> 2:23:46,64
[Beyond the Peak]


2916
2:23:46,64 --> 2:23:51,16
Oil is the foundation of


2917
2:23:51,16 --> 2:23:55,48
and is present throughout, the edifice of human civilization.


2918
2:23:55,48 --> 2:23:59,68
There are 10 calories of hydrocarbon energy –oil and natural gas–


2919
2:23:59,68 --> 2:24:3,88
in every calorie of food you and I eat in the industrialized world.


2920
2:24:3,88 --> 2:24:6,6
Fertilizers are made from natural gas.


2921
2:24:6,6 --> 2:24:8,76
Pesticides are made from oil.


2922
2:24:8,76 --> 2:24:11,56
You drive oil-powered machines to plant - plow - irrigate – harvest


2923
2:24:11,56 --> 2:24:14,4
transport - package. You wrap the food


2924
2:24:14,4 --> 2:24:16,8
in plastic – that's oil. All plastic is oil.


2925
2:24:16,8 --> 2:24:19,44
There are 7 gallons of oil in every tire.


2926
2:24:19,44 --> 2:24:22,6
Oil is everywhere; it's ubiquitous. And it's only because


2927
2:24:22,6 --> 2:24:24,96
of oil that there are 7 billion people or


2928
2:24:24,96 --> 2:24:27,92
almost 7 billion people on this planet right now.


2929
2:24:27,92 --> 2:24:30,2
The arrival of this cheap and easy energy


2930
2:24:30,2 --> 2:24:32,28
which is equivalent, by the way, to


2931
2:24:32,28 --> 2:24:36,16
billions of slaves working around the clock


2932
2:24:36,16 --> 2:24:40,4
changed the world in such a radical way over the last century


2933
2:24:40,4 --> 2:24:43,36
and the population has gone up 10 times.


2934
2:24:43,36 --> 2:24:47,72
But, by 2050, oil supply is able to support


2935
2:24:47,72 --> 2:24:49,84
less than half the present world's


2936
2:24:49,84 --> 2:24:52,8
population in their present way of life.


2937
2:24:52,8 --> 2:24:57,28
So, the scale of adjustment to live differently is just enormous.


2938
2:24:57,28 --> 2:25:1,2
The world is now using six barrels of oil for every barrel of finds.


2939
2:25:1,2 --> 2:25:3,4
Five years ago it was using four


2940
2:25:3,4 --> 2:25:5,44
barrels of oil for every barrel it finds.


2941
2:25:5,44 --> 2:25:7,2
A year from now it is going to be using


2942
2:25:7,2 --> 2:25:9,24
eight barrels of oil for every barrel of finds.


2943
2:25:9,24 --> 2:25:11,44
What's disturbing to me is the


2944
2:25:11,44 --> 2:25:16,2
lack of any real effort from governments worldwide


2945
2:25:16,2 --> 2:25:20,0
and industry leaders worldwide to do something different.


2946
2:25:20,0 --> 2:25:24,4
We have these, sort of, attempts to build more wind power


2947
2:25:24,4 --> 2:25:26,72
and to maybe do something with Tide...


2948
2:25:26,72 --> 2:25:31,2
we've got attempts to make our cars a little bit more efficient


2949
2:25:31,2 --> 2:25:33,56
but there's nothing which really looks like a


2950
2:25:33,56 --> 2:25:36,2
revolution coming along- these are all pretty minor


2951
2:25:36,2 --> 2:25:38,4
and that I think is pretty frightening.


2952
2:25:38,4 --> 2:25:42,0
And the governments who are driven by these economists


2953
2:25:42,0 --> 2:25:45,16
who don't really appreciate what we're talking about


2954
2:25:45,16 --> 2:25:50,28
are trying to stimulate consumerism to restore past prosperity


2955
2:25:50,28 --> 2:25:52,64
in the hope that they can restore the past.


2956
2:25:52,64 --> 2:25:56,64
They're printing yet more money lacking any collateral at all.


2957
2:25:56,64 --> 2:25:58,68
So, if the economy improves and


2958
2:25:58,68 --> 2:26:1,32
recovers and the famous growth comes back


2959
2:26:1,32 --> 2:26:3,56
it will only be short-lived because


2960
2:26:3,56 --> 2:26:7,4
within a short period of time counted in months


2961
2:26:7,4 --> 2:26:11,0
rather than years it will hit the supply barrier again;


2962
2:26:11,0 --> 2:26:12,68
there will be another price shock-


2963
2:26:12,68 --> 2:26:14,6
and a deeper recession. So I think


2964
2:26:14,6 --> 2:26:16,68
we go into a series of vicious circles


2965
2:26:16,68 --> 2:26:18,76
So you have the economic growth going up- price


2966
2:26:18,76 --> 2:26:21,2
spike- everything shuts down. That's where we are now.


2967
2:26:21,2 --> 2:26:24,76
Then it starts to come up again but what we have now is this


2968
2:26:24,76 --> 2:26:28,68
area where there's no more ability to produce cheap energy.


2969
2:26:28,68 --> 2:26:31,72
We're at the peak- were on the down slope of oil production.


2970
2:26:31,72 --> 2:26:35,44
No way you're going to get any more out of the ground any faster


2971
2:26:35,44 --> 2:26:39,4
which means that things shut down, the price of oil drops


2972
2:26:39,4 --> 2:26:45,8
which it did in early 2009 but then as you have a “recovery”


2973
2:26:45,8 --> 2:26:47,0
the price of oil starts to come back.


2974
2:26:47,0 --> 2:26:49,32
It's recently been hovering at about $80


2975
2:26:49,32 --> 2:26:51,6
a barrel and what we see is that at even at $80 a


2976
2:26:51,6 --> 2:26:54,0
barrel now, with the financial and economic collapse


2977
2:26:54,0 --> 2:26:55,96
people are having a hard time affording that.


2978
2:26:55,96 --> 2:27:0,84
World oil production right now is about 86 million barrels a day.


2979
2:27:0,84 --> 2:27:4,32
Over 10 years, you're looking at


2980
2:27:4,32 --> 2:27:8,64
roughly 14 million barrels a day having to be replaced.


2981
2:27:8,64 --> 2:27:12,8
There's nothing around which can come even


2982
2:27:12,8 --> 2:27:14,96
within 1% of meeting that sort of demand.


2983
2:27:14,96 --> 2:27:17,48
If we don't do something pretty quickly


2984
2:27:17,48 --> 2:27:20,8
there's going to be a huge energy deficiency.


2985
2:27:20,8 --> 2:27:24,92
I think the big mistake is in not recognizing


2986
2:27:24,92 --> 2:27:28,88
a decade or so ago that a concerted effort


2987
2:27:28,88 --> 2:27:30,28
needed to be made to develop


2988
2:27:30,28 --> 2:27:31,96
these sustainable forms of energy.


2989
2:27:31,96 --> 2:27:35,48
I think that's something our grandchildren will look back on with


2990
2:27:35,48 --> 2:27:39,6
total disbelief. 'You people knew you


2991
2:27:39,6 --> 2:27:42,24
were dealing with a finite commodity...


2992
2:27:42,24 --> 2:27:45,48
how could you possibly have build your economy


2993
2:27:45,48 --> 2:27:49,0
around something which was going to disappear?'


2994
2:27:49,0 --> 2:27:51,8
For the first time in human history


2995
2:27:51,8 --> 2:27:54,92
the species is now faced with the depletion of a core resource


2996
2:27:54,92 --> 2:27:57,6
central to our current system of survival.


2997
2:27:57,6 --> 2:27:59,96
And the punchline of the whole thing is


2998
2:27:59,96 --> 2:28:2,28
that even with oil becoming more scarce


2999
2:28:2,28 --> 2:28:5,4
the economic system will still blindly push


3000
2:28:5,4 --> 2:28:7,44
its cancerous growth model...


3001
2:28:7,44 --> 2:28:10,72
so people can go out and buy more oil powered cars


3002
2:28:10,72 --> 2:28:16,8
to generate GDP and jobs... exasperating the decline.


3003
2:28:16,8 --> 2:28:18,16
Are there solutions to replace the


3004
2:28:18,16 --> 2:28:20,24
edifice of the hydrocarbon economy?


3005
2:28:20,24 --> 2:28:21,72
Of course.


3006
2:28:21,72 --> 2:28:24,12
But the path needed to accomplish these changes


3007
2:28:24,12 --> 2:28:28,48
will not manifest through the Market System Protocols required


3008
2:28:28,48 --> 2:28:30,84
since new solutions can only be


3009
2:28:30,84 --> 2:28:33,96
implemented through the Profit Mechanism.


3010
2:28:33,96 --> 2:28:36,64
People are not investing in renewable energies


3011
2:28:36,64 --> 2:28:40,0
because there is no money in it in both long and short term.


3012
2:28:40,0 --> 2:28:42,56
And the commitment needed to make it happen


3013
2:28:42,56 --> 2:28:45,6
can only occur at a severe financial loss.


3014
2:28:45,6 --> 2:28:48,8
Therefore, there is no monetary incentive and in this


3015
2:28:48,8 --> 2:28:53,64
system, if there is no monetary incentive, things do not happen.


3016
2:28:53,64 --> 2:28:55,92
And on top of it all, Peak Oil is


3017
2:28:55,92 --> 2:28:58,56
just one of many surfacing consequences


3018
2:28:58,56 --> 2:29:2,88
of the environmental-social train wreck gaining speed today.


3019
2:29:2,88 --> 2:29:5,24
Other declines include Fresh Water


3020
2:29:5,24 --> 2:29:7,44
-the very fabric of our existence-


3021
2:29:7,44 --> 2:29:9,8
which is currently showing


3022
2:29:9,8 --> 2:29:11,6
shortages for 2.8 billion people


3023
2:29:11,6 --> 2:29:16,36
and those shortages are on pace to reach 4 billion by 2030.


3024
2:29:16,36 --> 2:29:17,92
Food Production:


3025
2:29:17,92 --> 2:29:21,92
The destruction of arable crop land, from which


3026
2:29:21,92 --> 2:29:24,72
99.7% of all human food comes from today


3027
2:29:24,72 --> 2:29:29,28
is occurring up to 40 times faster than it is being replenished


3028
2:29:29,28 --> 2:29:31,8
and over the last 40 years, 30% of the


3029
2:29:31,8 --> 2:29:34,52
arable land has become unproductive.


3030
2:29:34,52 --> 2:29:37,6
Not to mention that hydrocarbons are the backbone


3031
2:29:37,6 --> 2:29:40,4
of agriculture today and as it declines...


3032
2:29:40,4 --> 2:29:42,68
so will the food supply.


3033
2:29:42,68 --> 2:29:44,4
As far as resources in general


3034
2:29:44,4 --> 2:29:47,72
at our current patterns of consumption, by 2030


3035
2:29:47,72 --> 2:29:51,4
we will need 2 planets to continue our rates.


3036
2:29:51,4 --> 2:29:53,36
Not to mention the continual destruction


3037
2:29:53,36 --> 2:29:55,88
of life supporting biodiversity


3038
2:29:55,88 --> 2:29:57,72
causing extinction spasms and


3039
2:29:57,72 --> 2:30:0,72
environmental destabilization across the globe.


3040
2:30:0,72 --> 2:30:2,64
And with all of these declines


3041
2:30:2,64 --> 2:30:5,36
we have the near exponential population growth


3042
2:30:5,36 --> 2:30:8,8
where by 2030 there might be over


3043
2:30:8,8 --> 2:30:10,8
8 billion people on this planet.


3044
2:30:10,8 --> 2:30:13,68
Energy production alone would need to


3045
2:30:13,68 --> 2:30:17,64
increase 44% by 2030 to meet such demand.


3046
2:30:17,64 --> 2:30:22,12
And again, since money is the only initiator of action-


3047
2:30:22,12 --> 2:30:24,12
are we to expect that any country on


3048
2:30:24,12 --> 2:30:26,44
the planet is going to be able to afford


3049
2:30:26,44 --> 2:30:29,84
the massive changes needed to revolutionize agriculture


3050
2:30:29,84 --> 2:30:33,8
water processing, energy production and the like?


3051
2:30:33,8 --> 2:30:35,0
When the global debt pyramid scheme is


3052
2:30:35,0 --> 2:30:37,84
slowly shutting the entire world down...


3053
2:30:37,84 --> 2:30:39,28
Not to mention the fact that


3054
2:30:39,28 --> 2:30:40,96
the unemployment you currently see


3055
2:30:40,96 --> 2:30:43,16
is going to become normality due to


3056
2:30:43,16 --> 2:30:45,76
the nature of technological unemployment.


3057
2:30:45,76 --> 2:30:48,48
The jobs are not coming back.


3058
2:30:48,48 --> 2:30:50,96
And finally, a broad social perspective.


3059
2:30:50,96 --> 2:30:53,84
From the 1970 to 2010, poverty on this


3060
2:30:53,84 --> 2:30:56,84
planet doubled due to this system...


3061
2:30:56,84 --> 2:30:58,64
and given our current state-


3062
2:30:58,64 --> 2:31:0,6
do you honestly think we will see


3063
2:31:0,6 --> 2:31:2,6
anything less than more doubling...


3064
2:31:2,6 --> 2:31:6,64
more suffering and more mass starvation?


3065
2:31:6,64 --> 2:31:8,56
[The Beginning]


3066
2:31:8,56 --> 2:31:11,16
There is not going to be any recovery.


3067
2:31:11,16 --> 2:31:13,24
This is not some long depression


3068
2:31:13,24 --> 2:31:15,84
that we're some day going to pull out of.


3069
2:31:15,84 --> 2:31:18,16
I think the next phase that we are going to see after the


3070
2:31:18,16 --> 2:31:21,0
next round of economic collapses is massive civil unrest.


3071
2:31:21,0 --> 2:31:23,12
When unemployment checks stop being


3072
2:31:23,12 --> 2:31:25,92
paid because the states have no money left.


3073
2:31:25,92 --> 2:31:29,92
And when things get so bad that people lose confidence


3074
2:31:29,92 --> 2:31:33,8
in their elected leaders, they will demand change


3075
2:31:33,8 --> 2:31:36,72
if we don't kill each other in the process


3076
2:31:36,72 --> 2:31:38,68
or destroy the environment.


3077
2:31:38,68 --> 2:31:43,48
I'm just afraid that we might get to the point of no return...


3078
2:31:43,48 --> 2:31:45,72
and that bothers me to no end.


3079
2:31:45,72 --> 2:31:50,56
We do all we can to avoid that condition.


3080
2:31:50,56 --> 2:31:56,72
It's clear that we're on the verge of a great transition in human life...


3081
2:31:56,72 --> 2:31:59,64
That what we face now is this fundamental


3082

change of the life we've known over the last century.


3083
2:32:3,48 --> 2:32:6,4
There has to be a link between the economy and


3084
2:32:6,4 --> 2:32:8,44
the resources of this planet


3085
2:32:8,44 --> 2:32:11,8
the resources being, of course, all animal and plant life;


3086
