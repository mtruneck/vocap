221
0:8:17,2 --> 0:8:18,7
I tried two of them.

247
0:9:12,68 --> 0:9:16,5
here alone, by myself.


248
0:9:16,5 --> 0:9:20,47
And then Nats came here
one month later.

0:9:43,48 --> 0:9:44,2
Guu family.


258
0:9:44,2 --> 0:9:47,6
He's my brother.

He's already my brother.

Chop the scallion with egg.

Oh, looks good, man.


281
0:10:37,34 --> 0:10:38,79
I'm still hungry.

0:10:41,83 --> 0:10:44,17
So good.


285
0:10:44,17 --> 0:10:46,85
Especially like, after drinking,
we need some of


286

those soup dishes.
