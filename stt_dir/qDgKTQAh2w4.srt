Our son Thomas

the youngest.


37

 a moment's notice.</i>


42
0:1:55,281 --> 0:1:57,616
Tom: We do not plan
to stay in Houston;


43
0:1:57,616 --> 0:2:0,92
we plan to bug
out as quickly


44
0:2:0,92 --> 0:2:3,189
and efficiently
as we can.


45
0:2:3,189 --> 0:2:8,727

terroristic attack.


46
0:2:8,727 --> 0:2:9,695
On your knees!

0:2:9,695 --> 0:2:17,87
Man: Please.


48
0:2:17,87 --> 0:2:20,172
<i> Narrator: Tom fears
 the dirty bomb.</i>


49
0:2:20,172 --> 0:2:23,676
<i> An everyday explosive,
 like dynamite or TNT,</i>


50
0:2:23,676 --> 0:2:28,747
<i> packed with
 radioactive material.</i>


51
0:2:28,747 --> 0:2:31,784
<i> Once detonated, its blast
 can spread radiation</i>


52
0:2:31,784 --> 0:2:35,821
<i> anywhere from a city block
 to several square miles.</i>


53
0:2:35,821 --> 0:2:37,957
<i> But that radioactive
 debris could lodge in</i>


54

<i> buildings, and chemically
 bind with concrete and</i>


55
0:2:40,593 --> 0:2:42,728
<i> asphalt, making
 decontaminating a city</i>


56
0:2:42,728 --> 0:2:45,3
<i> difficult, and possibly
 forcing affected</i>


57
0:2:45,3 --> 0:2:46,765
<i> neighborhoods
 to be abandoned.</i>


58
0:2:46,765 --> 0:2:49,468
Tom: If a dirty bomb
exploded in the Houston


59
0:2:49,468 --> 0:2:52,271
metroplex area there
would be disarray.


60
0:2:52,271 --> 0:2:53,839
There would be
people yelling,


61
0:2:53,839 --> 0:2:55,541
screaming,
shooting.


62
0:2:55,541 --> 0:2:57,776
There could be looting,
home invasions.


63
0:2:57,776 --> 0:3:1,146
People would do things
they normally wouldn't do.


64
0:3:1,146 --> 0:3:3,182
I do not want to
be around that and


65
0:3:3,182 --> 0:3:9,21
I do not want to put
my family at risk.


66
0:3:9,21 --> 0:3:10,923
<i> Narrator: Because Tom
 fears Houston could be</i>


67
0:3:10,923 --> 0:3:13,692
<i> uninhabitable after a
 dirty bomb explosion,</i>


68
0:3:13,692 --> 0:3:17,496
<i> his entire prepping plan
 begins with bugging out.</i>


69
0:3:17,496 --> 0:3:20,99
Tom: If the (bleep)
hit the fan I


70
0:3:20,99 --> 0:3:25,4
would definitely
get out of there.


71
0:3:25,4 --> 0:3:27,94
We practice how quickly
we can get out of our


72
0:3:27,94 --> 0:3:30,676
homestead and
load up our goods,


73
0:3:30,676 --> 0:3:32,778
so we can get
out of Houston.


74
0:3:32,778 --> 0:3:34,48
<i> Narrator: The fastest
 Tom and his family have</i>


75
0:3:34,48 --> 0:3:36,815
<i> bugged out of their
 home is 10 minutes,</i>


76
0:3:36,815 --> 0:3:39,251
<i> a drill they usually
 practice twice a month.</i>


77
0:3:39,251 --> 0:3:41,253
Matthew:
Hurry, hurry.


78
0:3:41,253 --> 0:3:42,955
Tom: Get strapped
in, okay buddy?


79
0:3:42,955 --> 0:3:44,256
<i> Narrator: Today
 is the start of</i>


80
0:3:44,256 --> 0:3:46,592
<i> their 3rd drill
 this year.</i>


81
0:3:46,592 --> 0:3:47,593
Tom: You got
everything?


82
0:3:47,593 --> 0:3:51,43
You got your gun?


83
0:3:51,43 --> 0:3:55,968
That's bugging out.


84
0:3:55,968 --> 0:3:57,97
<i> Narrator: Tom's bug out
 route bypasses over</i>


85
0:3:57,97 --> 0:4:0,739
<i> 3,000 miles of
 Houston's highways and</i>


86
0:4:0,739 --> 0:4:2,141
<i> once on the open road,</i>


87
0:4:2,141 --> 0:4:4,743
<i> they travel due west
 to their safe house.</i>


88
0:4:4,743 --> 0:4:9,148
<i> 300 miles away in
 Brackettville, Texas.</i>


89
0:4:9,148 --> 0:4:10,949
Tom: We have prepped
for many years


90
0:4:10,949 --> 0:4:12,685
to go to a compound.


91
0:4:12,685 --> 0:4:14,82
<i> Narrator: It's normally a
 six-hour drive to Tom's</i>


92
0:4:14,82 --> 0:4:16,955
<i> compound, but he
 believes it could take</i>


93
0:4:16,955 --> 0:4:19,992
<i> as many as 21 hours, if
 the other two million</i>


94
0:4:19,992 --> 0:4:23,562
<i> Houstonians are also
 attempting to flee.</i>


95
0:4:23,562 --> 0:4:25,898
<i> As a result, Tom
 has three back-up,</i>


96
0:4:25,898 --> 0:4:27,633
<i> bug-out routes.</i>


97
0:4:27,633 --> 0:4:33,405
Tom: You cannot over
prepare for a disaster.


98
0:4:33,405 --> 0:4:35,7
<i> Narrator: The Perez's
 bug out compound is</i>


99
0:4:35,7 --> 0:4:38,377
<i> 700 acres bigger
 than 100 square</i>


100
0:4:38,377 --> 0:4:40,512
<i> New York City blocks.</i>


101
0:4:40,512 --> 0:4:42,114
<i> Tom's nicknamed
 his compound and</i>


102
0:4:42,114 --> 0:4:48,721
<i> its two limestone
 homes "the Alamo."</i>


103
0:4:48,721 --> 0:4:51,19
Tom: This is what we
consider our last stand.


104
0:4:51,19 --> 0:4:53,492
<i> Narrator: The original
 Alamo in San Antonio is</i>


105
0:4:53,492 --> 0:4:55,327
<i> synonymous with
 a last stand</i>


106
0:4:55,327 --> 0:4:57,96
<i> against
 impossible odds.</i>


107
0:4:57,96 --> 0:4:59,298
<i> If the Perez's ever
 come under siege,</i>


108
0:4:59,298 --> 0:5:0,733
<i> Tom wants to
 ensure they don't</i>


109
0:5:0,733 --> 0:5:2,701
<i> suffer the same fate.</i>


110
0:5:2,701 --> 0:5:5,738
<i> So he's spent 10 years
 and more than two million</i>


111
0:5:5,738 --> 0:5:12,378
<i> dollars turning his Alamo
 into a veritable fortress.</i>


112
0:5:12,378 --> 0:5:14,847
Tom: I designed it, set
up the security for it.


113
0:5:14,847 --> 0:5:16,315
We have layers
of security,


114
0:5:16,315 --> 0:5:19,551
such as solid steel
bars on the windows,


115
0:5:19,551 --> 0:5:22,154
we have alarms.


116
0:5:22,154 --> 0:5:23,956
<i> Narrator: Tom's Alamo
 is fortified with</i>


117
0:5:23,956 --> 0:5:26,592
<i> seven-inch thick,
 bulletproof walls.</i>


118
0:5:26,592 --> 0:5:29,128
<i> Surrounding it is four
 miles of seven-foot tall</i>


119
0:5:29,128 --> 0:5:31,363
<i> barbed wire fencing.</i>


120
0:5:31,363 --> 0:5:34,233
<i> And beyond that is the
 Chihuahuan desert;</i>


121
0:5:34,233 --> 0:5:36,502
<i> the largest desert
 in North America.</i>


122
0:5:36,502 --> 0:5:38,303
Tom: It is a
harsh terrain.


123
0:5:38,303 --> 0:5:40,5
It would be hard
for individuals


124
0:5:40,5 --> 0:5:43,41
to come across
this barren area.


125
0:5:43,41 --> 0:5:44,743
That's why we
decided to have this


126
0:5:44,743 --> 0:5:47,813
as our safe
bug out area.


127
0:5:47,813 --> 0:5:50,849
For me prepping is
not an obsession,


128
0:5:50,849 --> 0:5:52,284
it's therapeutic.


129
0:5:52,284 --> 0:5:54,887
When I pass
our gates here,


130
0:5:54,887 --> 0:5:58,123
my blood pressure
drops 8 to 10 points.


131
0:5:58,123 --> 0:5:59,925
<i> Narrator: But
 not before Tom</i>


132
0:5:59,925 --> 0:6:4,363
<i> performs a
 security check.</i>


133
0:6:4,363 --> 0:6:6,799
<i> The rest of the family
 must wait in the vehicle</i>


134
0:6:6,799 --> 0:6:13,772
<i> until Tom determines
 it's safe to enter.</i>


135
0:6:13,772 --> 0:6:16,341
<i> Tom modeled his security
 check strategy after a</i>


136
0:6:16,341 --> 0:6:20,446
<i> SWAT team technique called
 "deliberate entry."</i>


137
0:6:20,446 --> 0:6:22,47
Anyone in here?


138
0:6:22,47 --> 0:6:23,248
<i> Narrator: Which
 is typically used</i>


139
0:6:23,248 --> 0:6:24,983
<i> in narcotic raids
 when the exact</i>


140
0:6:24,983 --> 0:6:27,419
<i> location of a
 threat is unknown.</i>


141
0:6:27,419 --> 0:6:41,2
Tom: Anyone
in here?


142
0:6:41,2 --> 0:6:46,138
Okay, cabin
one secure.


143
0:6:46,138 --> 0:6:47,739
<i> Narrator: Once the
 cabins are secure,</i>


144
0:6:47,739 --> 0:6:49,541
<i> Tom makes sure
 every other part of</i>


145
0:6:49,541 --> 0:6:53,979
<i> his plan is in
 working order.</i>


146
0:6:53,979 --> 0:6:57,216
Tom: I spend
approximately five hours,


147
0:6:57,216 --> 0:7:0,352
six hours a day
determining what


148
0:7:0,352 --> 0:7:1,653
I have prepped.


149
0:7:1,653 --> 0:7:5,424
We investigate, modify,
exchange, sell,


150
0:7:5,424 --> 0:7:8,794
to have the most current
available MRE meals,


151
0:7:8,794 --> 0:7:10,462
rifles, ammunition.


152
0:7:10,462 --> 0:7:11,93
Prepping is infinite.


153
0:7:11,93 --> 0:7:13,198
<i> Narrator: Tom
 maintains about</i>


154
0:7:13,198 --> 0:7:15,934
<i> 46,000 rounds
 of ammunition;</i>


155
0:7:15,934 --> 0:7:18,36
<i> enough bullets to
 shoot every person</i>


156
0:7:18,36 --> 0:7:20,672
<i> in the county
 12 times.</i>


157
0:7:20,672 --> 0:7:23,642
<i> But all of Tom's preps
 play a defensive role,</i>


158
0:7:23,642 --> 0:7:26,678
<i> even his food and water.</i>


159
0:7:26,678 --> 0:7:28,914
<i> The Perez's have a
 nine-month supply of food</i>


160
0:7:28,914 --> 0:7:32,918
<i> at the ranch, but not all
 of it is safe to eat.</i>


161
0:7:32,918 --> 0:7:37,222
Tom: I also have
taken the liberty of


162
0:7:37,222 --> 0:7:40,759
contaminating 10% of my
food and water supply.


163
0:7:40,759 --> 0:7:43,562
If it is ever compromised,
I'm the only one that


164
0:7:43,562 --> 0:7:51,737
knows which supplies
are affected.


165
0:7:51,737 --> 0:7:54,273
<i> Narrator: Tom wants his
 toxic supplies to be an</i>


166
0:7:54,273 --> 0:7:56,408
<i> unwelcome surprise
 to anyone foolish</i>


167
0:7:56,408 --> 0:7:59,311
<i> enough to storm
 the Alamo.</i>


168
0:7:59,311 --> 0:8:1,113
<i> But while most preppers
 might consider</i>


169
0:8:1,113 --> 0:8:3,515
<i> contaminating water
 counter intuitive,</i>


170
0:8:3,515 --> 0:8:5,484
<i> Tom isn't worried
 because he has an</i>


171
0:8:5,484 --> 0:8:7,92
<i> almost endless
 supply.</i>


172
0:8:7,92 --> 0:8:10,155
Tom: This is my
lifeline for water.


173
0:8:10,155 --> 0:8:12,24
<i> Narrator: Tom
 strategically built his</i>


174
0:8:12,24 --> 0:8:13,859
<i> ranch above the
 Edwards aquifer,</i>


175
0:8:13,859 --> 0:8:16,328
<i> an underground water
 source roughly 10 times</i>


176
0:8:16,328 --> 0:8:20,332
<i> larger than the
 city of Los Angeles.</i>


177
0:8:20,332 --> 0:8:22,501
<i> The aquifer provides
 water to close to</i>


178
0:8:22,501 --> 0:8:25,103
<i> two million Texans
 everyday and</i>


179
0:8:25,103 --> 0:8:28,106
<i> Tom has his own
 personal access.</i>


180
0:8:28,106 --> 0:8:31,176
<i> His 45-foot tall windmill
 draws water directly up</i>


181
0:8:31,176 --> 0:8:33,579
<i> from 1,000 feet
 below ground and</i>


182
0:8:33,579 --> 0:8:37,316
<i> can pump 11,000
 gallons a day.</i>


183
0:8:37,316 --> 0:8:39,718
Tom: As long as
the aquifers are


184
0:8:39,718 --> 0:8:42,854
energized by rainfall
we should have


185
0:8:42,854 --> 0:8:47,893
adequate water for
many years to come.


186
0:8:47,893 --> 0:8:50,62
<i> Narrator: If the Alamo
 ever comes under attack,</i>


187
0:8:50,62 --> 0:8:51,763
<i> and the windmill
 is damaged,</i>


188
0:8:51,763 --> 0:8:54,299
<i> Tom's main water supply
 could be cut off,</i>


189
0:8:54,299 --> 0:8:56,1
<i> so he has a reserve
 supply of more than</i>


190
0:8:56,1 --> 0:8:59,771
<i> 2,000 gallons in
 concrete tanks.</i>


191
0:8:59,771 --> 0:9:1,373
Tom: I coulda gone
with plastic tanks,


192
0:9:1,373 --> 0:9:4,9
woulda been a lot
easier, a lot cheaper.


193
0:9:4,9 --> 0:9:6,745
<i> Narrator: Unlike plastic,
 concrete is fire resistant</i>


194
0:9:6,745 --> 0:9:8,714
<i> and Tom believes it
 will keep his water</i>


195
0:9:8,714 --> 0:9:11,149
<i> protected against
 incendiary bombs,</i>


196
0:9:11,149 --> 0:9:13,285
<i> such as Molotov
 cocktails.</i>


197
0:9:13,285 --> 0:9:15,787
<i> To test his theory, he's
 making his own brand of</i>


198
0:9:15,787 --> 0:9:18,89
<i> Molotov cocktail from a
 secret recipe of ordinary</i>


199
0:9:18,89 --> 0:9:22,427
<i> household items,
 like high proof alcohol</i>


200
0:9:22,427 --> 0:9:24,29
<i> and detergent.</i>


201
0:9:24,29 --> 0:9:27,899
Tom: Torch fuel, don't
leave home without it.


202
0:9:27,899 --> 0:9:29,868
<i> Narrator: Tom's goal
 is to make his custom</i>


203
0:9:29,868 --> 0:9:32,771
<i> recipe produce a longer
 lasting flame that can</i>


204
0:9:32,771 --> 0:9:34,473
<i> stick to a target,</i>


205
0:9:34,473 --> 0:9:36,875
<i> similar to the
 effects of napalm.</i>


206
0:9:36,875 --> 0:9:39,444
Tom: Now that's a good
Molotov cocktail.


207
0:9:39,444 --> 0:9:41,413
<i> Narrator: With the help
 of local law enforcement,</i>


208
0:9:41,413 --> 0:9:43,782
<i> he's ready to test it
 for the first time,</i>


209
0:9:43,782 --> 0:9:47,185
<i> to prove his tank is
 in fact fireproof.</i>


210
0:9:47,185 --> 0:10:5,871
Tom: Bring on
the terrorists.


211
0:10:5,871 --> 0:10:8,84
From what I've seen
after numerous examples


212
0:10:8,84 --> 0:10:14,379
of these explosives,
it's built to last.


213
0:10:14,379 --> 0:10:16,248
It can take a
licking and


214
0:10:16,248 --> 0:10:20,986
will keep on
storing water.


215
0:10:20,986 --> 0:10:23,321
<i> Narrator: If survivors of
 a dirty bomb attack do</i>


216
0:10:23,321 --> 0:10:26,91
<i> penetrate every layer
 of Tom's security,</i>


217
0:10:26,91 --> 0:10:30,228
<i> he has a last line of
 defense, his family.</i>


218
0:10:30,228 --> 0:10:31,329
Tom: How would you
defend the door?


219
0:10:31,329 --> 0:10:32,33
What would
you do,


220
0:10:32,33 --> 0:10:33,465
since we've been
talking about it?


221
0:10:33,465 --> 0:10:35,233
Matthew: Shoot
through the window.


222
0:10:35,233 --> 0:10:36,468
<i> Narrator: Tom
 knows he can't</i>


223
0:10:36,468 --> 0:10:38,203
<i> defend the
 Alamo alone.</i>


224
0:10:38,203 --> 0:10:40,772
<i> So he's been training
 17-year-old Kat,</i>


225
0:10:40,772 --> 0:10:43,975
<i> 12-year-old Tommy, and
 six-year-old Matthew</i>


226
0:10:43,975 --> 0:10:46,78
<i> how to use
 various firearms.</i>


227
0:10:46,78 --> 0:10:47,446
Tom: If you're going to
talk to your children


228
0:10:47,446 --> 0:10:49,815
about drugs, talk to
them about prepping.


229
0:10:49,815 --> 0:10:53,719
It's no different.


230
0:10:53,719 --> 0:10:55,187
<i> Narrator: Matthew,
 who has been shooting</i>


231
0:10:55,187 --> 0:10:57,55
<i> since the age of four,
 can hit a target from</i>


232
0:10:57,55 --> 0:10:58,924
<i> 100 yards
 away with his</i>


233
0:10:58,924 --> 0:11:1,46
<i> child-sized
 sniping rifle.</i>


234
0:11:1,46 --> 0:11:3,295
Matthew: Really
prepared for,


235
0:11:3,295 --> 0:11:6,298
like invasion
or something.


236
0:11:6,298 --> 0:11:8,4
Tommy: He's not
like other dads.


237
0:11:8,4 --> 0:11:12,7
He teaches us many
tactical ways to survive.


238
0:11:12,7 --> 0:11:14,506
Tom: Wow,
that is good.


239
0:11:14,506 --> 0:11:17,109
Katarina: He's very
smart, very smart.


240
0:11:17,109 --> 0:11:19,1
You know we're always,
like, on our toes.


241
0:11:19,1 --> 0:11:20,512
Monica: He
orchestrates pretty


242
0:11:20,512 --> 0:11:24,483
much everything as far
as keeping us safe.


243
0:11:24,483 --> 0:11:25,851
<i> Narrator: Because
 Tom wants his family</i>


244
0:11:25,851 --> 0:11:27,185
<i> ready at all times,</i>


245

 skills weekly.</i>


246

Tom: Alright
hold my spot.


247
0:11:30,722 --> 0:11:33,291
<i> Narrator: So, today he's
 asked off-duty officers</i>


248
0:11:33,291 --> 0:11:35,227
<i> from the local
 sheriff's department</i>


249
0:11:35,227 --> 0:11:38,363
<i> to ambush
 their home.</i>


250

<i> Without telling
 his three kids.</i>


251
0:11:40,932 --> 0:11:42,33
Katarina: Don't give
him the gun Thomas!


252
0:11:42,33 --> 0:11:42,901
Officer Villarreal:
I'll shoot her!


253
0:11:42,901 --> 0:11:43,635
Put your
gun down!


254
0:11:43,635 --> 0:11:49,741

<i> But his wife and three

264
0:12:18,37 --> 0:12:21,72
Tom: Grandpa's here,
Grandpa's here.


265
0:12:21,72 --> 0:12:22,774

<i> each of which indicates
 a particular threat.</i>


268
0:12:27,445 --> 0:12:29,748
Monica: "Grandpa's here"
means get ready.


269
0:12:29,748 --> 0:12:34,219
There's an
intruder, get armed.

Monica: Get down.

0:12:56,441 --> 0:12:57,776
<i> Narrator: Tom thinks

Get down.

0:13:5,283 --> 0:13:6,618
<i> Narrator: Today, he

Get away!


300
0:13:26,171 --> 0:13:27,5
Officer Villarreal:
Put your gun down.


301
0:13:27,5 --> 0:13:27,939
Put your hands
behind your head.


302
0:13:27,939 --> 0:13:30,408
Sheriff Pena: Ok,
everyone quit.


303
0:13:30,408 --> 0:13:34,946
We're done,
c'mon in.


304
0:13:34,946 --> 0:13:36,915
Katarina: It's scary
to see my mom getting


305
0:13:36,915 --> 0:13:40,418
held up by one of the
gunman and seeing


306
0:13:40,418 --> 0:13:42,52
my two little brothers
just surrendering.


307
0:13:42,52 --> 0:13:44,956
Thomas: Me and my
little brother we were


308
0:13:44,956 --> 0:13:47,492
kind of not sure
what to do.


309
0:13:47,492 --> 0:13:48,526
Officer Gutierrez:
Criticize right


310
0:13:48,526 --> 0:13:49,394
off the bat;


311
0:13:49,394 --> 0:13:50,762
everybody comes
out of the house.


312
0:13:50,762 --> 0:13:52,53
Everybody should
be in the house.


313
0:13:52,53 --> 0:13:53,731
For your
protection.


314
0:13:53,731 --> 0:13:55,2
<i> Narrator: Officer
 Gutierrez believes coming</i>


315

<i> them more vulnerable

317
0:13:59,704 --> 0:14:0,872
Officer Gutierrez:
Carlos came up behind


318
0:14:0,872 --> 0:14:3,141
the house, picked
your daughter off.


319
0:14:3,141 --> 0:14:4,309
Officer Spence: I
was getting close.


320
0:14:4,309 --> 0:14:5,577
It's okay to
be aggressive.


321
0:14:5,577 --> 0:14:8,13
Don't be afraid to,
to be aggressive.


322
0:14:8,13 --> 0:14:9,714
You know you were
going away from the


323
0:14:9,714 --> 0:14:11,65
threat instead
of coming to it.


324
0:14:11,65 --> 0:14:14,286
Tom: I like that
recommendation of being


325
0:14:14,286 --> 0:14:16,221
aggressive and you
know get in there


326
0:14:16,221 --> 0:14:17,489
and putting
them down.


327
0:14:17,489 --> 0:14:19,557
Katarina: I think my
family needs more time


328
0:14:19,557 --> 0:14:22,794
and more planning on
strategies because


329
0:14:22,794 --> 0:14:24,462
like a situation
today, you know,


330
0:14:24,462 --> 0:14:26,364
everything just
fell apart.


331
0:14:26,364 --> 0:14:27,599
Tom: I will tell
you one thing,


332
0:14:27,599 --> 0:14:30,35
I will heed to
those criticisms,


333
0:14:30,35 --> 0:14:32,704
and I will implement
what's necessary.


334
0:14:32,704 --> 0:14:34,205
Thank you so much
for your time.


335
0:14:34,205 --> 0:14:41,746
This is the Alamo and we
will be here to defend it.


336
0:14:41,746 --> 0:14:43,581
<i> Narrator: Tom believes
 defending the Alamo's</i>


337
0:14:43,581 --> 0:14:46,151
<i> expansive land and
 provisions is a greater</i>


338
0:14:46,151 --> 0:14:49,921
<i> task than his family of
 five can take on alone.</i>


339
0:14:49,921 --> 0:14:51,89
<i> So to strengthen their
 forces against what</i>


340
0:14:51,89 --> 0:14:54,492
<i> could be millions of
 displaced Houstonians,</i>


341
0:14:54,492 --> 0:14:58,73
<i> Tom recruited another
 prepping family.</i>


342
0:14:58,73 --> 0:15:1,66
<i> When the time
 comes, Victoria,</i>


343
0:15:1,66 --> 0:15:4,2
<i> Gobriela and Steve
 Vanasse will unite with</i>


344
0:15:4,2 --> 0:15:6,471
<i> Tom at "the Alamo."</i>


345
0:15:6,471 --> 0:15:8,39
Steve: Prepping is
probably in the back


346
0:15:8,39 --> 0:15:11,209
of my mind
more than sex.


347
0:15:11,209 --> 0:15:14,446
Tom: Steven, he's
rather unusual.


348
0:15:14,446 --> 0:15:17,282
However, he is no
different than what I am.


349
0:15:17,282 --> 0:15:19,317
Steve: I'm preparing
for a dirty bomb blast


350
0:15:19,317 --> 0:15:26,491
in the city
of Houston.


351
0:15:26,491 --> 0:15:30,161
The time of reckoning is
just around the corner


352
0:15:30,161 --> 0:15:32,53
and that's why
I'm prepping and


353
0:15:32,53 --> 0:15:37,902
that's why the rest
of you are prepping.


354
0:15:37,902 --> 0:15:40,372
A dirty bomb is
particularly dangerous


355
0:15:40,372 --> 0:15:43,208
because of the readily
available nature of any


356
0:15:43,208 --> 0:15:49,147
radionuclide that would
be used in a dirty bomb.


357
0:15:49,147 --> 0:15:54,185
Elements such as
cesium, strontium;


358
0:15:54,185 --> 0:15:56,821
those radionuclides
are available in


359
0:15:56,821 --> 0:16:0,692
medicine in the
medical field.


360
0:16:0,692 --> 0:16:2,427
<i> Narrator: Radioactive
 substances can be</i>


361
0:16:2,427 --> 0:16:5,13
<i> found in hospitals,
 research facilities</i>


362
0:16:5,13 --> 0:16:7,665
<i> and construction
 sites.</i>


363
0:16:7,665 --> 0:16:10,1
<i> These materials are
 required to be secured</i>


364
0:16:10,1 --> 0:16:11,97
<i> from unauthorized
 access,</i>


365
0:16:11,97 --> 0:16:14,539
<i> but Steve fears a
 theft could occur.</i>


366
0:16:14,539 --> 0:16:17,308
Steve: It's so easy
to manufacture.


367
0:16:17,308 --> 0:16:19,944
The unpredictability
of a dirty bomb


368
0:16:19,944 --> 0:16:22,18
is the terrorists'
best weapon.


369
0:16:22,18 --> 0:16:24,149
We've been
lucky so far.


370
0:16:24,149 --> 0:16:29,621
I don't think our
fortune will hold out.


371
0:16:29,621 --> 0:16:32,39
Some might call
preparing for


372

Gobriela: Good.


391
0:17:19,437 --> 0:17:21,873
Tom: I have chosen
Steven because he


392
0:17:21,873 --> 0:17:27,846
has expertise in
areas that I am weak.


393
0:17:27,846 --> 0:17:29,114
Steve: I've been
certified as a

0:17:29,114 --> 0:17:30,815
radiation
specialist.


395
0:17:30,815 --> 0:17:33,685
The filed I am in,
I'm constantly reminded


396

prepare and be safe.

Graham: Oh good,
excellent thank you.


405
0:17:53,771 --> 0:17:55,707
Let's just see
what we got here.

<i> concern in prepping for
 a dirty bomb explosion.</i>


408
0:18:1,513 --> 0:18:2,914
Steve: The dirty bomb
would be the tipping


409
0:18:2,914 --> 0:18:10,221
point that pushes mild
Houstonians into chaos.


410
0:18:10,221 --> 0:18:11,923
<i> Narrator: Steve thinks
 anarchy following an</i>

 be more deadly,</i>

<i> so amassing firearms
 is his top priority.</i>


413
0:18:17,28 --> 0:18:19,63
Steve: I want to
be able to defend


414
0:18:19,63 --> 0:18:20,832
against a
large-scale assault,


415
0:18:20,832 --> 0:18:23,168
should such an
assault occur.


416
0:18:23,168 --> 0:18:25,403
<i> Narrator: In fact, when
 Steve became a prepper,</i>


417
0:18:25,403 --> 0:18:27,839

 was purchase a rifle.</i>


418
0:18:27,839 --> 0:18:30,275
<i> And his collection
 has grown since.</i>


419
0:18:30,275 --> 0:18:32,544
Steve: I have more
than one weapon


420
0:18:32,544 --> 0:18:35,46
because I consider
my family backup


421
0:18:35,46 --> 0:18:36,581
as well too.


422
0:18:36,581 --> 0:18:39,15
I wanna train Victoria
in the proper


423
0:18:39,15 --> 0:18:41,953
and responsible
use of firearms.


424
0:18:41,953 --> 0:18:43,788
For goodness
sakes, who knows?


425
0:18:43,788 --> 0:18:47,292
Someday she might
have my back.


426
0:18:47,292 --> 0:18:49,727
Victoria: I don't
want to shoot guns.


427
0:18:49,727 --> 0:18:56,301
Gobriela: I think about
Victoria firing a gun.


428
0:18:56,301 --> 0:18:57,936
It freak me out.


429
0:18:57,936 --> 0:18:59,237
It's very
dangerous.


430
0:18:59,237 --> 0:19:2,574
I don't like the idea,
but she need to do it.


431
0:19:2,574 --> 0:19:4,275
Victoria: Yes, I
really have to learn


432
0:19:4,275 --> 0:19:13,484
cause I "need" to.


433
0:19:13,484 --> 0:19:14,819
Where are we going?


434
0:19:14,819 --> 0:19:16,988
Steve: Victoria, we are
going to Shiloh shooting


435
0:19:16,988 --> 0:19:19,924
range, introduce you to
the proper handling of


436
0:19:19,924 --> 0:19:22,594
firearms and respect
for firearms.


437
0:19:22,594 --> 0:19:25,129
Just want you
to be safe.


438
0:19:25,129 --> 0:19:27,265
We take all these
opportunities


439
0:19:27,265 --> 0:19:29,0
to do things
as a family.


440
0:19:29,0 --> 0:19:30,802
It's our
prepping.


441
0:19:30,802 --> 0:19:32,36
Tracy: Uh, so we're
gonna learn to


442
0:19:32,36 --> 0:19:33,504
shoot some guns
today right?


443
0:19:33,504 --> 0:19:35,34
Victoria: Right.


444
0:19:35,34 --> 0:19:36,574
Tracy: Have you
every shot before?


445
0:19:36,574 --> 0:19:37,475
Steve: Yes.


446
0:19:37,475 --> 0:19:38,309
Tracy: And
have you?


447
0:19:38,309 --> 0:19:39,277
Victoria: No.


448
0:19:39,277 --> 0:19:40,345
Tracy: And uh
what caliber are


449
0:19:40,345 --> 0:19:41,546
you experienced with?


450
0:19:41,546 --> 0:19:43,514
Steve: 40 cal, I have a
40 caliber I'm carrying now.


451
0:19:43,514 --> 0:19:44,849
Tracy: All right well
let's head back to the range.


452
0:19:44,849 --> 0:19:47,819
Steve: Thanks.


453
0:19:47,819 --> 0:19:49,754
<i> Narrator: The 40 caliber
 pistol is considered</i>


454
0:19:49,754 --> 0:19:52,9

<i> But Victoria will be
 learning how to use a</i>

<i> .22, which is
 considered a top choice</i>


460
0:20:6,7 --> 0:20:9,407
<i> for beginners, because
 there is less recoil.</i>


461
0:20:9,407 --> 0:20:11,9
Tracy: Rack it back
and just let it go.


462
0:20:11,9 --> 0:20:12,11
That will
load the gun.


463
0:20:12,11 --> 0:20:13,444
Alright so we're
gonna push out,


464
0:20:13,444 --> 0:20:15,28
slowly gonna work
your finger back on


465
0:20:15,28 --> 0:20:17,515
the trigger
nice and easy,


466
0:20:17,515 --> 0:20:18,616
and the gun
goes off


467
0:20:18,616 --> 0:20:19,917
and you make
your shot.


468
0:20:19,917 --> 0:20:20,885
Okay?


469
0:20:20,885 --> 0:20:22,387
That's gonna be
about how loud it is.


470
0:20:22,387 --> 0:20:25,123
Alright, you ready
to give it a try?


471
0:20:25,123 --> 0:20:26,824
Victoria: No,
but yes.


472
0:20:26,824 --> 0:20:31,729
Tracy: There
you go, lovely.


473
0:20:31,729 --> 0:20:33,64
Stuff that in
there, good.


474
0:20:33,64 --> 0:20:34,499
It's ok.


475
0:20:34,499 --> 0:20:36,67
You see that front
sight right there?


476
0:20:36,67 --> 0:20:37,168
You see that dot?


477
0:20:37,168 --> 0:20:38,903
Now try and keep that
front sight on the x as


478
0:20:38,903 --> 0:20:40,204
you bring that
trigger back nice and


479
0:20:40,204 --> 0:20:43,908
smooth and slow
for me okay?


480
0:20:43,908 --> 0:20:46,311
Great job,
very nice;


481
0:20:46,311 --> 0:20:47,512
that was a
good shot.


482
0:20:47,512 --> 0:20:48,446
Victoria: Really?


483
0:20:48,446 --> 0:20:52,25
Tracy: Yeah, look,
very good job.


484
0:20:52,25 --> 0:20:53,818
How'd that feel?


485
0:20:53,818 --> 0:20:54,752
Victoria: Weird.


486
0:20:54,752 --> 0:20:55,586
Tracy: Weird.


487
0:20:55,586 --> 0:20:56,487
A little bit
exciting?


488
0:20:56,487 --> 0:20:57,422
A little bit
nervous?


489
0:20:57,422 --> 0:20:58,489
Victoria: Yea a
little bit exciting.


490
0:20:58,489 --> 0:21:0,658
Tracy: Yeah, you want
to try another round?


491
0:21:0,658 --> 0:21:2,6
Ok, let it go.


492
0:21:2,6 --> 0:21:4,495
Okay slowly
work it back.


493
0:21:4,495 --> 0:21:5,43
Good job!


494
0:21:5,43 --> 0:21:6,898
Right next
to my shot.


495
0:21:6,898 --> 0:21:12,203
Very good,
you're a natural.


496
0:21:12,203 --> 0:21:18,42
Dad's so proud.


497
0:21:18,42 --> 0:21:20,545
Usually the younger
girls are a little bit


498
0:21:20,545 --> 0:21:22,914
more timid and scared
but she dived right in


499
0:21:22,914 --> 0:21:25,316
and did her thing, she
did a really good job.


500
0:21:25,316 --> 0:21:26,884
Victoria: I was
scared because I was


501
0:21:26,884 --> 0:21:28,653
scared of
hurting someone.


502
0:21:28,653 --> 0:21:31,22
Steven: I feel so
proud right now.


503
0:21:31,22 --> 0:21:33,658
Victoria: I don't think
I will shoot again.


504
0:21:33,658 --> 0:21:36,894
Steven: And I feel like
I'm better prepared now,


505
0:21:36,894 --> 0:21:41,866

count on Victoria.

0:23:52,96 --> 0:23:56,367
They, they just do a
lot of bad stuff so.


557
0:23:56,367 --> 0:23:58,703
So this is the backup
right here, ok?


558
0:23:58,703 --> 0:24:0,571
<i> Narrator: Tom is teaching
 his sons how to kill a</i>


559

whoa, whoa, whoa.


565
0:24:14,151 --> 0:24:18,456
Tommy and Matthew:
Whoa, it's a goat.


566
0:24:18,456 --> 0:24:19,857
Tom: Well, I'll tell
you what, Thomas,


567
0:24:19,857 --> 0:24:22,193
Uh I'm to climb
in there and


568
0:24:22,193 --> 0:24:23,461
then hand
me my bag.


569
0:24:23,461 --> 0:24:24,896
Okay?


570
0:24:24,896 --> 0:24:45,216
If something happens
get your knife out.


571
0:24:45,216 --> 0:24:46,484
Hold him down.


572
0:24:46,484 --> 0:24:48,119
Hold him with your
fist like that.


573
0:24:48,119 --> 0:24:52,89
Alright now
get up.


574
0:24:52,89 --> 0:24:55,359
It's a quick,
painless death.


575
0:24:55,359 --> 0:24:57,261
And you want to
be swift about it


576
0:24:57,261 --> 0:25:0,97
because this animal
will provide


577
0:25:0,97 --> 0:25:2,5
food for many days.


578
0:25:2,5 --> 0:25:3,334
Okay?


579
0:25:3,334 --> 0:25:4,201
Tommy: Uh-huh.


580
0:25:4,201 --> 0:25:6,17
Tom: And we have
respect for animals.


581
0:25:6,17 --> 0:25:9,574
Alright give
me your hand.


582
0:25:9,574 --> 0:25:10,541
You ready?


583
0:25:10,541 --> 0:25:11,342
Tommy: Yeah.


584
0:25:11,342 --> 0:25:12,677
Tom: Hold it
tight, real hard.


585
0:25:12,677 --> 0:25:15,546
Come right here.


586
0:25:15,546 --> 0:25:18,182
Ok, ready?


587
0:25:18,182 --> 0:25:28,726
Hold him down,
hold him down.


588
0:25:28,726 --> 0:25:36,3
You did very good,
you did very good.


589
0:25:36,3 --> 0:25:37,535
Matthew: Ugh.


590
0:25:37,535 --> 0:25:39,17
Tom: Matthew
come over here.


591
0:25:39,17 --> 0:25:40,671
I want you to come
over here this way


592
0:25:40,671 --> 0:25:44,41
and face us
this way.


593
0:25:44,41 --> 0:25:46,811
Why did we kill
this goat today?


594
0:25:46,811 --> 0:25:49,8
Matthew: For extra
back up plan.


595
0:25:49,8 --> 0:25:51,582
Tom: Good back up
plan, way to go.


596
0:25:51,582 --> 0:25:54,352
He's gone to a
better place now.


597
0:25:54,352 --> 0:25:56,354
Do you like
it out here?


598
0:25:56,354 --> 0:25:59,29
Is it safer for us?


599
0:25:59,29 --> 0:26:1,459
We'll be moving
here soon, okay?


600
0:26:1,459 --> 0:26:2,96
Permanently.


601
0:26:2,96 --> 0:26:7,698
Alright, Thomas here,
this was your first goat.


602
0:26:7,698 --> 0:26:9,2

605
0:26:14,438 --> 0:26:15,873
Tom: Was this
your first goat?


606
0:26:15,873 --> 0:26:16,874
Matthew: Yes.


607
0:26:16,874 --> 0:26:19,21
Tom: Okay let me put
a little bit here.


608
0:26:19,21 --> 0:26:21,479
And this shows
your manhood.


609
0:26:21,479 --> 0:26:23,47
Now you guys
someday will do


610
0:26:23,47 --> 0:26:25,149
this with your
children, ok?


611
0:26:25,149 --> 0:26:30,221
I am very proud of you,
very proud of you.


612
0:26:30,221 --> 0:26:33,19
1,2,3.


613
0:26:33,19 --> 0:26:36,227
Tommy: The killing the
goat part was really,


614
0:26:36,227 --> 0:26:38,462
really challenging
part for me.


615
0:26:38,462 --> 0:26:40,464
I felt sad for
it, in a way.


616
0:26:40,464 --> 0:26:44,101
Matthew: I felt
sad for the animal;


617
0:26:44,101 --> 0:26:46,637
like you feel sad
when you kill a goat


618
0:26:46,637 --> 0:26:47,638
or something.


619
0:26:47,638 --> 0:26:49,674
To cut it's
neck off.


620
0:26:49,674 --> 0:26:52,576
Tom: 2, 3.


621
0:26:52,576 --> 0:26:54,145
All right there?


622
0:26:54,145 --> 0:27:4,388
Okay there we go.


623
0:27:4,388 --> 0:27:5,756
Narrator: Tom is
training himself,


624
0:27:5,756 --> 0:27:7,525
and his kids
to survive a


625
0:27:7,525 --> 0:27:10,161
world without
stored goods.


626
0:27:10,161 --> 0:27:13,23
But their hunted game
is not just for them.


627
0:27:13,23 --> 0:27:15,232
In following their
plan for doomsday,


628
0:27:15,232 --> 0:27:17,101
the Perez and
Vanasse families


629
0:27:17,101 --> 0:27:19,804
will soon
combine forces.


630
0:27:19,804 --> 0:27:22,239
But Tom has decided
to make a change in


631
0:27:22,239 --> 0:27:24,542
Steve's regular
arrival routine.


632
0:27:24,542 --> 0:27:25,576
Tom: Get on
your knees.


633
0:27:25,576 --> 0:27:26,51
Steve: This is
not the plan.


634
0:27:26,51 --> 0:27:33,651
Tom: What plan?

or a month after


646

a dirty bomb
descends on Houston.


647
0:28:1,679 --> 0:28:3,147
I'm leaving;

Great dry run
everyone.


687

Victoria: Are
we there yet?


688
0:29:37,842 --> 0:29:39,51
Steve: We're trying
to move as far as


689
0:29:39,51 --> 0:29:44,815
we can from an
anticipated blast zone.


690
0:29:44,815 --> 0:29:46,55
<i> Narrator: The distance

can pull over,


695
0:29:56,694 --> 0:29:58,429
take some readings.


696
0:29:58,429 --> 0:30:1,799
If those readings look
good, we can relax.


697
0:30:1,799 --> 0:30:3,1

698
0:30:3,1 --> 0:30:5,436

out your
hands please?


702

<i> Narrator: But if Steve
 determines they are</i>


703
0:30:16,614 --> 0:30:19,583
<i> unsafe, they will
 have to keep driving.</i>

check your feet.


705
0:30:22,686 --> 0:30:24,788
Readings are
all clear.


706
0:30:24,788 --> 0:30:26,59
I think that we're
all clear here.


707
0:30:26,59 --> 0:30:28,92
We'll be able
to take off our


708
0:30:28,92 --> 0:30:29,827
personal protective
equipment.


709
0:30:29,827 --> 0:30:33,464

today was wonderful,

0:30:33,464 --> 0:30:36,2
quick and positive.


711
0:30:36,2 --> 0:30:37,268
Victoria: No.


712
0:30:37,268 --> 0:30:40,804
I didn't because it was
too hot in the suit.


713
0:30:40,804 --> 0:30:43,974
Steve: My family really
came together on this.


714
0:30:43,974 --> 0:30:52,783
From here, we're on to

721
0:31:5,963 --> 0:31:7,731
However, I try to
give him advice,


722
0:31:7,731 --> 0:31:9,767
but in my opinion,


723
0:31:9,767 --> 0:31:15,105
I would say I'm a
better prepper.

I'm not gonna let anyone
come on this property,


739
0:31:53,944 --> 0:31:55,579

person takes


740

Steve: Be cool,
be cool.


744

about the girls?


748
0:32:10,494 --> 0:32:11,695
Do they have
weapons?


749
0:32:11,695 --> 0:32:13,63
Steve: They're
both unarmed.


750
0:32:13,63 --> 0:32:15,32
We drove all the
way from Houston,


751
0:32:15,32 --> 0:32:23,674

0:32:28,145 --> 0:32:31,715

was alarming.

I had every course
of adrenaline

through me.

Based on the

our families can
form the basis of a


786

maybe a better society.

Steve: Katarina

been working
on some basil,


792
0:34:6,677 --> 0:34:10,447
and some garlic
and some oregano.


793
0:34:10,447 --> 0:34:12,49
And so it is just
a combination on

Steve: I would eat

816
0:35:4,268 --> 0:35:7,237
Tom: We always try to seek
other methods to improve


817
0:35:7,237 --> 0:35:10,14
and refine the
areas of weakness.


818
0:35:10,14 --> 0:35:11,808

820

0:35:16,246 --> 0:35:19,349
to practice
IED placement.


822
0:35:19,349 --> 0:35:20,284
Tom: Okay.


823
0:35:20,284 --> 0:35:21,218
Steve: See how

824
0:35:21,218 --> 0:35:25,656

circumstances?


825
0:35:25,656 --> 0:35:27,624

Steven is safety.


853
0:36:41,665 --> 0:36:45,469

0:39:45,348 --> 0:39:47,5
I have to let
you go, dude.


925
0:39:47,5 --> 0:39:51,254
I'm serious.


926
0:39:51,254 --> 0:39:57,16
I'm sorry, I'm gonna
have to let you go.


927
0:39:57,16 --> 0:39:58,295
I'm sorry;


928
0:39:58,295 --> 0:39:59,696
I just don't know what
else to tell you.


929
0:39:59,696 --> 0:40:0,864
Steve: No matter
what happens, man,


930
0:40:0,864 --> 0:40:2,499
I'm still
here for you.


931
0:40:2,499 --> 0:40:4,634
I am.


932
0:40:4,634 --> 0:40:8,71
I'm heartbroken.


933
0:40:8,71 --> 0:40:20,217
He's in pain.


934
0:40:20,217 --> 0:40:21,818
<i> Narrator: But
 after realizing he</i>


935
0:40:21,818 --> 0:40:24,12
<i> did not suffer any
 permanent damage,</i>


936
0:40:24,12 --> 0:40:25,989
<i> Tom reassessed
 whether or not,</i>


937
0:40:25,989 --> 0:40:30,393
<i> to end his four-year
 partnership with Steve.</i>


938
0:40:30,393 --> 0:40:33,864
Tom: We're gonna have to
work on a lot of rules.


939
0:40:33,864 --> 0:40:36,132
Safety needs to
be put first.


940
0:40:36,132 --> 0:40:39,269
I mean, I'm just
worried that's all man.


941
0:40:39,269 --> 0:40:40,136
Ya know?


942
0:40:40,136 --> 0:40:42,138
It's cool, I
trust you man.


943
0:40:42,138 --> 0:40:43,94
But, we're just
gonna have


944
0:40:43,94 --> 0:40:46,176
to work on
safety man.


945
0:40:46,176 --> 0:40:46,977
Okay?


946
0:40:46,977 --> 0:40:48,645
Steve: Your
ranch, your rules.


947
0:40:48,645 --> 0:40:49,646
I respect that.


948
0:40:49,646 --> 0:40:51,181
Tom: Alright,
right, ok man;


949
0:40:51,181 --> 0:40:57,754
we can eat and
just move on.


950
0:40:57,754 --> 0:40:59,222
Now notice the
legs are much


951
0:40:59,222 --> 0:41:1,892
more well done
than the ribs?


952
0:41:1,892 --> 0:41:6,696
Steve: Being prepared
is not a straight line.


953
0:41:6,696 --> 0:41:8,698
Tom: This is
in my opinion,


954
0:41:8,698 --> 0:41:12,335
the best survival team
that could come together.


955
0:41:12,335 --> 0:41:15,672
Steve: I certainly have
room for improvement.


956
0:41:15,672 --> 0:41:17,807
Alright, let's
eat, feast!


957
0:41:17,807 --> 0:41:34,658
And I recognize
that.


958
0:41:34,658 --> 0:41:47,103
Katarina: Just swallow
it, just swallow it.


959
0:41:47,103 --> 0:41:48,905
<i> Narrator: Tom and
 Steve, the experts,</i>


960

963
0:41:54,844 --> 0:41:57,714
<i> Steve, your chance at

<i> bug out to
 Tom's ranch.</i>


966
0:42:1,585 --> 0:42:3,53
Steve: Yes.


967
0:42:3,53 --> 0:42:4,955
<i> Narrator: Tom, your
 water preps are highly</i>


968
0:42:4,955 --> 0:42:7,357

970
0:42:9,893 --> 0:42:12,529
<i> enough to sustain
 both families.</i>


971
0:42:12,529 --> 0:42:15,498
<i> However, the 300-mile
 trip to your compound</i>


972
0:42:15,498 --> 0:42:17,67
<i> could be difficult
 if a flood of</i>

0:42:17,67 --> 0:42:19,235
<i> people is also
 leaving Houston.</i>


974
0:42:19,235 --> 0:42:21,404
<i> You may have to
 travel by foot.</i>


975
0:42:21,404 --> 0:42:23,873
<i> The experts recommend you
 store hidden caches of</i>

0:42:23,873 --> 0:42:25,976
<i> supplies along
 your bug out route.</i>


977
0:42:25,976 --> 0:42:28,211
Tom: I haven't gone
all in just yet,


978
0:42:28,211 --> 0:42:32,549
so I'm holding back
on a few cards.


979
0:42:32,549 --> 0:42:34,184
<i> Narrator: To determine how

0:43:3,947 --> 0:43:6,75

<i> survival time

999
0:43:23,566 --> 0:43:25,769
Tom: I agree with
a majority of the


1000
0:43:25,769 --> 0:43:28,772
assessments, however
as a prepper,


1001
0:43:28,772 --> 0:43:31,107
I don't disclose
all my resources.


1002
0:43:31,107 --> 0:43:32,676
I hope others
will learn and


1003
0:43:32,676 --> 0:43:37,814
I am learning from others
that are preppers.


1004
0:43:37,814 --> 0:43:39,249
Steve: Prepper brother
and sisters and


1005
0:43:39,249 --> 0:43:41,451
welcome back
National Geographic.


1006
0:43:41,451 --> 0:43:43,787
National Geographic's
experts brutally


1007
0:43:43,787 --> 0:43:46,222
nailed me on
their assessment.


1008
0:43:46,222 --> 0:43:49,659
Victoria's been training
in high caliber weapons,


1009
0:43:49,659 --> 0:43:53,363
archery, and she's
deadly accurate.


1010
0:43:53,363 --> 0:43:57,233
And she's also trained
in defensive driving


1011
0:43:57,233 --> 0:44:0,737
maneuvers and she loves to
drive and does it well.


1012
0:44:0,737 --> 0:44:5,241
Gobriela and I took
fencing classes and


1013
0:44:5,241 --> 0:44:11,47
we're also studying for
our HAM radio license.


1014
0:44:11,47 --> 0:44:12,649
Tom: Hello, this is
Tom uh reporting


1015
0:44:12,649 --> 0:44:14,117
back on a
follow-up.


1016
0:44:14,117 --> 0:44:15,552
Just thought I'd
let you all know,


1017
0:44:15,552 --> 0:44:17,353
we've decided to home
school our kids.


1018
0:44:17,353 --> 0:44:18,521
If something
were to happen,


1019
0:44:18,521 --> 0:44:21,57
we continue to
educate our child.


1020
0:44:21,57 --> 0:44:23,993
We have a well-written
curriculum here at


1021
0:44:23,993 --> 0:44:26,73
"Doomsday Academy,"
something handy just


1022
0:44:26,73 --> 0:44:28,865
for a little
fire drill.


1023
0:44:28,865 --> 0:44:32,702
And I'm also trying to
procure a uh armor car


1024
0:44:32,702 --> 0:44:35,405
vehicle used, and
uh that will be our


1025
0:44:35,405 --> 0:44:36,806
new bug-out vehicle.


1026
0:44:36,806 --> 0:44:39,75
And also we're working
on our bunker now,


1027
0:44:39,75 --> 0:44:41,244
uh on undisclosed
areas.


1028
0:44:41,244 --> 0:44:44,881
Here at Doomsday
Academy, signing off.


1029
0:44:44,881 --> 0:44:52,21
God bless our troops,
God bless America.
