###72 IVAR BERGLIN: Gorgoroth may not be the most celebrated
###74 band to rise out of the infamous Norwegian black metal
###77 scene, but they are by far the most feared and controversial.
###80 With their abrasive sound, chaotic live shows, and
###83 well-publicized criminal convictions, Gorgoroth have
###86 spread their message of fear and hate across the world.
###88 At the center of the storm of controversy is Gaahl,
###91 Gorgoroth lead vocalist and arguably the most
###94 despised man in Norway.
###95 In 2005, Gaahl was charged with torture-like violence and
###99 served nine months in prison.
###100 His second incarceration for violent acts.
###103 The court claims he tortured his victim for six hours while
###106 collecting his blood into a cup and threatened to
###108 make him drink it.
###109 In January of 2007, when he was ready for release,
###112 photographer Peter Beste took us to Gaahl's hometown in
###115 Norway to get to know the guy Terrorizer magazine calls the
###119 most evil man alive.
###121 I'm Ivar Berglin, welcome to Norway.
###123 
###145 But the story of Gaahl and Norwegian black metal actually
###148 starts in Newcastle, England back in 1979, when a local
###152 metal band named Venom, responding to the rampant
###154 commercialism of heavy metal, decided to take their music in
###157 a darker, more extreme direction through satanic
###160 lyrics and imagery.
###161 This spawned black metal, a term coined by their 1982
###164 album of the same name.
###165 From there, the door opened for bands with similar ideas
###168 and sounds.
###168 Bands like Mercyful Fate from Denmark, Hellhammer from
###172 Switzerland, and Bathory from Sweden.
###175 At the end of the '80s, a second wave of black metal
###178 surfaced in Norway.
###179 Bands like Dark Throne, Emperor, Immortal, and Mayhem
###182 perfected the black metal sound, taking the music's
###185 lyrics and stage imagery to even darker extremes.
###189 KING: We chose a different path.
###191 It was getting the music not as fast but atmospheric.
###197 It was also not as well-produced.
###201 It was more about the atmosphere the music created.
###204 And also the fact that we chose to have a satanic
###209 approach towards the lyrics and also combining those
###212 things to be an art form called black metal.
###215 PYTTEN: Euronymous called me, and I started working with him
###218 together with Varg Vikernes until '94, when all this stuff
###225 started happening to churches.
###226 
###230 IVAR BERGLIN: In the mid '90s, a series of crimes in Norway
###232 brought black metal to the attention of
###234 the mainstream media.
###235 The arson of over a dozen Christian churches and the
###238 murder of Mayhem guitarist Euronymous by band-mate Varg
###241 Vikernes, who stabbed him 23 times in the
###244 face, neck, and back.
###246 LARS NEDLIN: When it comes to the media coverage of the
###249 black metal in Norway, it all started with
###255 the criminal cases.
###256 I mean, it didn't start with the music when it comes to the
###259 tabloid in Norway.
###260 It started with the church burnings, with the murders and
###266 everything surrounding that era with Burzum and Varg
###271 Vikernes and, well, good tabloid stories basically.
###275 EINAR ENGELSTAD: I couldn't believe that
###277 they were that foolish.
###278 On the other hand, they had an identity because everybody was
###286 against them.
###288 When you're 17, 18 you believe in a lot of funny things.
###293 KVITRAFN: I'm not about to say if it's right or wrong.
###296 
###316 LARS NEDLIN: Then there's the music.
###318 And I think most of the bands today are
###321 centered around the music.
###322 But of course you have bands like Gorgoroth who have the
###325 ideology still very much intact within the band.
###328 There's a satanic ideology.
###329 
###339 GAAHL: Christianity is based only on
###343 stone, souls, and lives.
###350 And so, of course, every trace of them should be erased.
###359 [BLACK METAL MUSIC]
###390 IVAR BERGLIN: Gorgoroth basically means terror.
###392 
###398 PATRIZIA MAZZUOCCOLO: Gorgoroth is the ugliest
###400 sounding band within black metal.
###403 KVITRAFN: The energy you get from playing in that band
###406 really sticks out from everything
###408 else I've ever done.
###409 PATRIZIA MAZZUOCCOLO: If you're ever seen a live gig,
###412 you'd definitely understand.
###414 They're all extreme in the way that they look.
###416 And Gaahl, in particular.
###418 KVITRAFN: The whole makeup and spikes and flames and all of
###424 that is about putting faces to the music, really.
###428 And enhancing the things we are trying to express.
###431 KING: But when we present things to an audience, it's a
###435 message that's important, it's not the music.
###438 Gorgoroth is now three individuals,
###441 Infernus, me, and Gaahl.
###443 And everybody is very egocentric.
###446 KVITRAFN: It's a group of strong personalities.
###449 KING: But everything leads back to the our main agenda,
###454 it's spreading the word of Satan, or satanism himself.
###459 KVITRAFN: Well, to put it like this, we demand something from
###464 the listener.
###465 KING: The band is spreading fear.
###468 And we use that fear to actually create a change and
###470 also get our ideas across.
###475 LARS NEDLIN: There is one band that still is covered in the
###480 old-fashioned tabloid Norwegian black metal kind of
###483 way, and that's Gorgoroth.
###485 ERLEND ERICHSEN: Of course the media always like to focus on
###489 things that scares people.
###492 LARS NEDLIN: All genres, all music genres grow when there's
###495 controversy involved.
###496 PATRIZIA MAZZUOCCOLO: And I also believe that Gorgoroth
###498 like to flirt with the way that they're
###500 portrayed by the media.
###501 LARS NEDLIN: They serve a lot of things to the media in a
###504 way that makes it highly usable.
###508 GAAHL: It's very few people or bands around
###512 with a satanic message.
###516 So it's all about the music.
###517 It's not about the blast bass, it's not about how high the
###521 vocals scream or whatever.
###523 We are not about that.
###524 We are about the message.
###527 LARS NEDLIN: Like in South America, when you have riots
###529 breaking out.
###531 In Poland, where the tapes of the concerts that was filmed
###535 was taken by the police.
###537 
###544 IVAR BERGLIN: On February 1, 2004, Gorgoroth appalled the
###547 Catholic nation of Poland with a blasphemous display of
###550 satanic imagery at their most controversial show to date.
###553 KING: We had a lot of sheep skulls, as well as a lot of
###558 sheep heads on poles all over the front of the stage and
###562 four crosses.
###563 Up on the crosses were two naked men, hooded, and two
###568 naked hooded women.
###569 Covered in blood.
###569 The sheep represents the flock, and we represent the
###573 goat, the individual striving to go our own ways, not
###577 necessarily following the flock.
###580 GAAHL: The flock and the sheep, it's the Christian
###582 themselves that's chosen this word from the Bible.
###587 You have the goat, and you have the sheep.
###589 The sheep is the one that belongs to God, and the goat
###592 is the one that will be punished because
###594 they have a free will.
###596 IVAR BERGLIN: To get a better understanding of Gaahl and
###598 where he comes from, we travelled across Norway to the
###601 small mountain village where he was born
###603 and still lives today.
###605 
###608 KVITRAFN: Always been a lot of rumors about Gorgoroth and
###611 always a lot of rumors about Gaahl.
###615 And--
###616 IVAR BERGLIN: Are they true?
###618 KVITRAFN: Well, no, of c--
###622 well, maybe some.
###624 
###719 IVAR BERGLIN: I'm standing outside of Gaahl's house.
###722 Everything you see around us is owned by his family and has
###724 been so for generations.
###726 We're the first ever journalists to be here.
###728 And I'm quite honored but actually feeling quite scared.
###732 
###742 PETER BESTE: This town, I guess we could call it a
###743 valley, is named after his family.
###744 There's maybe five or six houses, each of which belong
###747 to a different member of the family.
###748 No other house as far as the eye can see in any direction.
###751 Closest town is about a 20 minute drive.
###753 ROB SEMMER: I mean the guy lives in complete isolation.
###756 No telephone, no nothing.
###758 I had to walk.
###759 His brother was the only one who had plumbing in the house.
###763 And his brother lived about a mile up the road.
###766 So every time I needed to take a shit or anything, I had to
###768 walk literally in ankle high mud because it had been
###772 raining for 72 days straight.
###779 IVAR BERGLIN: The first few hours in Espedal were
###781 nerve-wracking to say the least.
###782 I couldn't stop thinking about what could happen over the
###784 next couple of days.
###785 But after a few bottles from Gaahl's extensive wine
###788 collection, we all began to loosen up, laugh,
###790 and have a good time.
###792 IVAR BERGLIN: You know we're here because we're interested
###793 in the man behind all the spikes and skull makeup and--
###800 GAAHL: Of course.
###801 This might be one of my problems.
###803 When I talk to journalists, I talk to them as persons and
###811 not as journalists.
###813 IVAR BERGLIN: To keep it personal, Gaahl asked if
###814 instead of doing a traditional interview, we could just put
###817 the camera on a tripod and talk.
###819 GAAHL: What to follow the false gods will do basically.
###822 You will be allowed to focus on the god within yourself
###830 because that's the only true god.
###833 The god within everything.
###834 
###837 That's the only thing that for me is worth calling god.
###847 
###849 It is the highest spirit of everything and not this
###854 control freak that's telling you you're not supposed to do
###859 this, you're not supposed to do this, you're only supposed
###864 to bow down and kneel before what I say.
###868 Don't think.
###869 It's more than anything else.
###875 God is within man.
###876 God is within nature, and nature will always grow.
###880 That's the force of all life is to grow.
###884 
###890 ROB SEMMER: He personally took us all aside and critiqued us
###892 on what he thinks we could change about
###894 our lives and shit.
###895 And it's like he met us like a day before.
###898 And the thing that was blowing all of our minds, and we all
###901 got together the next day and had these little huddles when
###904 he wasn't around to talk about it, was how right on he was.
###907 PETER BESTE: I think everyone was just speaking very freely,
###909 and, of course, the wine was flowing, and I think we all
###913 saw a special side to Gaahl.
###916 PATRIZIA MAZZUOCCOLO: There are many sides to him.
###917 I think there's many sides to every human being.
###920 And of course, we can all be a little evil sometimes.
###924 DAVID: The kind of character that he is scares people.
###927 How direct he is about what he believes in.
###931 ERLEND ERICHSEN: One single word me and Gaahl never will
###934 forget, and that's honest.
###936 The word honest.
###938 PETER BESTE: This guy that has a reputation of being a
###940 bad-ass and a satanist and all sorts of other things, the
###943 rednecks out there want to challenge him, or fuck with
###946 him just like it would be in the States growing up if you
###948 were one of these kind of guys.
###949 So I think he gets people who will mess with
###952 him a little bit.
###952 And when he, as he says, when someone crosses my borders or
###958 steps on his foot, so to speak, that he
###961 teaches them a lesson.
###962 ROB SEMMER: We were walking down the road one day, and he
###964 showed me this little building, and he's like,
###967 that's my schoolhouse.
###969 He's like, yeah, between kindergarten and 18 years of
###972 age, I went to school there.
###975 And it was just me and one other kid.
###978 I was like, for 18 years you only went to school with one
###981 other person?
###982 And he was like, yeah and that kid lived
###984 like 45 minutes away.
###985 So when school was done, he had to get on a car or a bus
###989 to go home.
###989 Like I never got to hang out with him.
###992 GAAHL: Skol for--
###995 [INTERPOSING VOICES]
###996 GAAHL: Having an excellent time.
###1001 ROB SEMMER: It's one of a kind.
###1002 
###1065 GAAHL: I don't think of myself as someone who can paint.
###1068 That's why I quit art school because you cannot go to
###1073 school to become an artist.
###1074 IVAR BERGLIN: I've seen some of the stuff
###1078 you did before prison.
###1079 It would be interesting to see something you did in prison.
###1082 You and me talked about how an extreme
###1085 situation it was for you.
###1087 GAAHL: My whole process of creating is based on being
###1091 away from people.
###1096 I think this was the last one I did before I went into
###1099 prison maybe.
###1100 IVAR BERGLIN: Yeah?
###1101 GAAHL: I'm not certain.
###1102 
###1108 IVAR BERGLIN: Gaahl rarely shows anyone his paintings.
###1110 He doesn't sell them, and he hasn't shown
###1112 publicly since 1993.
###1114 So after days of asking, he finally let us take a look.
###1117 
###1120 GAAHL: I had an exhibition in '93, and then I just wrote
###1126 completely ridiculous prices, way overpriced at first,
###1130 because I didn't want to sell them.
###1132 There was this person that wanted to buy it anyway, and I
###1137 said, of course, that no, I have already sold it.
###1141 So he didn't get it.
###1143 I have hidden them away since then.
###1147 
###1155 IVAR BERGLIN: On our third day in Espedal, the rain finally
###1157 let up, so we travelled to Dale, the closest thing to
###1160 Gaahl's house resembling civilization.
###1162 Yeah, Gaahl just told me that the water's about one and a
###1165 half to two meters higher than it usually is because they've
###1168 had 76 days of rain here in a row, nonstop.
###1172 I made several phone calls to everyone from reporters to
###1175 local police trying to get anyone to comment on Gaahl.
###1178 I was met with excuse after excuse.
###1180 It seemed like the whole town was afraid of him until I
###1183 finally convinced one journalist that had followed
###1185 his case since the beginning to give me a brief interview.
###1188 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING NORWEGIAN]
###1189 
###1200 PETER BESTE: The more recent case that he just got out of
###1201 prison for was something similar.
###1203 He was attacked, he beat this guy, held him down for a
###1206 number of hours, I think tied him up, while slapping him.
###1211 Supposedly squeezing his balls, singing to him pretty
###1216 Norwegian lullabies while collecting his
###1219 blood into a cup.
###1220 The courts tried to say that he drank the guy's blood, or
###1223 he forced the guy to drink his own blood, but Gaahl claims it
###1225 was just to prevent it from getting on his carpet.
###1228 GAAHL: All of them have been just self-defense actually.
###1230 
###1234 But that I've crossed borders.
###1237 It's like with a painting.
###1238 You don't stop until it's finished.
###1241 
###1248 IVAR BERGLIN: And you think your punishment methods have
###1251 been effective?
###1251 Of course these people aren't going to attack you again, but
###1254 do you think you removed the sickness from their mind that
###1258 would allow them to do this in the first place?
###1262 Or do you think you just perpetuated it?
###1263 
###1267 GAAHL: Let's put it this way, if they were a bad seed, they
###1273 wouldn't spread it.
###1275 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING NORWEGIAN]
###1276 
###1301 GAAHL: Just by saying no to someone, punish them enough.
###1309 And someone, you probably need to cut to small pieces and sew
###1317 back together.
###1319 
###1335 IVAR BERGLIN: From the day we met Gaahl, he kept talking
###1337 about bringing us to a place that was very
###1339 important to him.
###1340 After three days of waiting on a window of decent weather, we
###1343 threw caution to the wind and followed him blindly into the
###1346 wilderness.
###1347 Only three of us had jackets.
###1348 Only two of us had boots.
###1350 And none of us had any idea where he'd take us.
###1353 GAAHL: Up there, it's this waterfall I was talking about.
###1356 IVAR BERGLIN: Yeah, we can get across the river.
###1358 GAAHL: I don't think so, but maybe we can walk up there and
###1362 walk around.
###1363 IVAR BERGLIN: Let's do that.
###1365 GAAHL: It's quite a long journey though.
###1367 IVAR BERGLIN: Let's see how long we make it.
###1368 
###1383 PETER BESTE: From the valley, he pointed out where we were
###1385 headed, and it was this snow-capped mountain off in
###1388 the distance.
###1388 And I thought he was joking.
###1389 It was quite far.
###1390 ROB SEMMER: So I put on basically every piece of
###1393 clothing I had in my bag.
###1395 I was wearing a pair of Nike hi-tops with plastic bags
###1398 wrapped around my feet.
###1399 
###1415 GAAHL: I have become what never fails, following in the
###1417 footsteps behind me.
###1420 I don't like to explain things to people because it's written
###1424 in a way that it should open the mind of the
###1428 listeners on tours.
###1430 
###1433 I have no interest in getting a flock of sheep that's just
###1437 following me because I'm the same one direction, and they
###1440 walk that direction.
###1441 Then I would be just as bad as society is.
###1445 So fear is necessary to separate the ones that's
###1451 willing to be led.
###1453 Or the one who choose to lead himself.
###1456 IVAR BERGLIN: [SPEAKING NORWEGIAN]
###1457 
###1460 GAAHL: [SPEAKING NORWEGIAN]
###1463 GAAHL: There's so many of the sheep character that's drawn
###1466 towards it as fans.
###1468 
###1471 There's so many low-lifes among the crowd.
###1475 There's so many just there for the music and nothing else.
###1479 You don't perform black metal if you're not a warrior.
###1483 Black metal is a war against what everyone knows.
###1490 IVAR BERGLIN: [SPEAKING NORWEGIAN]
###1492 GAAHL: [SPEAKING NORWEGIAN]
###1494 IVAR BERGLIN: [SPEAKING NORWEGIAN]
###1495 
###1502 GAAHL: As long as nature is not allowed to rule by the
###1506 laws of nature, there will always be king, and there will
###1509 always be slave.
###1510 
###1528 
###1574 ROB SEMMER: And at this point I just fucking went into a
###1576 panic, and I was just like, this is fucking stupid.
###1579 I don't know.
###1579 He won't even really tell us where you're bringing us or
###1582 why you're bringing us or what this is about.
###1586 At a point, I was just like, I don't care what the fuck is at
###1589 the top of the mountain.
###1589 You know what I mean?
###1591 It makes no difference to me.
###1592 We're going to jeopardize this whole entire project for some
###1595 stupid fucking nature walk.
###1597 This is about heavy metal.
###1598 This is about a band.
###1600 This isn't Field and Stream magazine.
###1601 
###1631 MIKE: Yeah, man.
###1632 
###1635 MIKE: Well sit tight, and I can go get them.
###1637 ROB SEMMER: I can't sit tight.
###1638 I'll freeze.
###1638 Seriously.
###1638 MIKE: What do you want me to do, man?
###1640 ROB SEMMER: I got to keep going.
###1641 
###1644 And I know, but the way down, even.
###1646 
###1655 PETER BESTE: Well, there's no choice at this point.
###1656 
###1668 GAAHL: The Superman.
###1670 And the idea will always conquer or always rise above,
###1676 no matter what, but you can not put down your sword
###1680 because then you'll lose.
###1681 
###1689 IVAR BERGLIN: So do you get frustrated being a lone wolf,
###1692 or do you like it?
###1693 Being one of the very few people who is worthy of the
###1697 title of a lead person?
###1699 
###1702 Is it lonely?
###1703 
###1707 GAAHL: I don't think that you ask me the right questions.
###1713 I don't think you're focusing on what's being told.
###1722 
###1725 IVAR BERGLIN: Guide me.
###1726
