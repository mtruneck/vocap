1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:23,5



2
0:0:23,5 --> 0:0:26,78
TOM CLARE: The English culture,
so many things are


3
0:0:26,78 --> 0:0:29,68
dying out, and we've got
so little to hold onto.


4
0:0:29,68 --> 0:0:32,8
And Morris dancing is one of
those things that goes back


5
0:0:32,8 --> 0:0:34,5
hundreds of years.


6
0:0:34,5 --> 0:0:37,8



7
0:0:37,8 --> 0:0:41,12
I'm undertaking a journey from
Olympia, in Greece, all the


8
0:0:41,12 --> 0:0:44,5
way to the Olympic Games opening
ceremony in London.


9
0:0:44,5 --> 0:0:48,59
I hope that my humble effort
has a little bit of the


10
0:0:48,59 --> 0:0:49,84
Olympic feel to it.


11
0:0:49,84 --> 0:0:57,74



12
0:0:57,74 --> 0:0:59,54
I think I could have
Morris danced the


13
0:0:59,54 --> 0:1:2,18
entire 2000 mile journey.


14
0:1:2,18 --> 0:1:7,99
Perhaps a little bit of support,
and a bit more time


15
0:1:7,99 --> 0:1:9,96
to be able to do
it comfortably.


16
0:1:9,96 --> 0:1:11,73
I really enjoyed dancing
through Greece.


17
0:1:11,73 --> 0:1:13,53
I got a fantastic
reception there.


18
0:1:13,53 --> 0:1:16,98
It was very much like being in
England with lots of people


19
0:1:16,98 --> 0:1:18,66
waving and cheering.


20
0:1:18,66 --> 0:1:20,99
And coming into France,
I've had a really


21
0:1:20,99 --> 0:1:22,24
good reaction, too.


22
0:1:22,24 --> 0:1:24,73



23
0:1:24,73 --> 0:1:28,28
Last night I was underneath a
motorway bridge, hiding from a


24
0:1:28,28 --> 0:1:33,6
thunderstorm, eating cold
beans, questioning is it


25
0:1:33,6 --> 0:1:33,8
really worth it?


26
0:1:33,8 --> 0:1:37,95
But then when I get to cycle
into the city, and dance in


27
0:1:37,95 --> 0:1:41,45
the city, the feel of elevation
I get, and when I


28
0:1:41,45 --> 0:1:44,99
see a smile on someone's face,
it's definitely worth it.


29
0:1:44,99 --> 0:1:48,87



30
0:1:48,87 --> 0:1:50,92
I don't have a woman waiting
for me at home.


31
0:1:50,92 --> 0:1:53,47
I'm not sure that a
woman would let


32
0:1:53,47 --> 0:1:55,16
me go on this adventure.


33
0:1:55,16 --> 0:2:0,73
So I'm staying free and enjoying
it at the moment.


34
0:2:0,73 --> 0:2:7,32
It


35
0:2:7,32 --> 0:2:10,53
KEVIN BLOWE: On the 27th of
April, a dispersal zone was


36
0:2:10,53 --> 0:2:13,67
created for an area
that surrounds


37
0:2:13,67 --> 0:2:14,66
Stratford town center.


38
0:2:14,66 --> 0:2:17,87
If there's more than two
people together at any


39
0:2:17,87 --> 0:2:21,72
particular point, police and
police community support


40
0:2:21,72 --> 0:2:26,67
officers can demand that
people disperse.


41
0:2:26,67 --> 0:2:28,72
What the dispersal zone does
is exactly the same as the


42
0:2:28,72 --> 0:2:29,51
powers of stop and search.


43
0:2:29,51 --> 0:2:31,5
It's about stigmatizing
people.


44
0:2:31,5 --> 0:2:33,77
It's making an assumption that
everybody who is of a certain


45
0:2:33,77 --> 0:2:37,46
age is likely to be causing some
sort of nuisance to the


46
0:2:37,46 --> 0:2:39,36
visitors that are
turning up here.


47
0:2:39,36 --> 0:2:41,46
It's based on a fear
of young people.


48
0:2:41,46 --> 0:2:42,75
It's based on the
assumption that


49
0:2:42,75 --> 0:2:44,55
everybody's up to no good.


50
0:2:44,55 --> 0:2:49,32
There's also a power that if
you're under 16 and you're out


51
0:2:49,32 --> 0:2:50,72
after 9 o'clock at night--


52
0:2:50,72 --> 0:2:52,93
and bear in mind, we're talking
about the summer--


53
0:2:52,93 --> 0:2:54,86
you can be picked up
by the police.


54
0:2:54,86 --> 0:2:57,22
And effectively what it's done
is create a curfew for anybody


55
0:2:57,22 --> 0:3:0,76
under the age of 16 between the
hours of 9 and 6 anywhere


56
0:3:0,76 --> 0:3:2,666
around this site.


57
0:3:2,666 --> 0:3:5,18
MALE SPEAKER: The idea
there is good.


58
0:3:5,18 --> 0:3:6,11
To keep everyone safe.


59
0:3:6,11 --> 0:3:7,9
I could respect that.


60
0:3:7,9 --> 0:3:11,54
But the whole fact that without
any reason, like, if


61
0:3:11,54 --> 0:3:14,28
you look suspicious, we'll have
to remove you from the


62
0:3:14,28 --> 0:3:15,2
whole bother.


63
0:3:15,2 --> 0:3:17,432
That's a bit extreme.


64
0:3:17,432 --> 0:3:19,58
MALE SPEAKER: Olympics is
only happening now.


65
0:3:19,58 --> 0:3:22,6
And we've been hanging around
here full time.


66
0:3:22,6 --> 0:3:24,51
We're happy that tourists are
coming, and they have the


67
0:3:24,51 --> 0:3:25,99
right to be here.


68
0:3:25,99 --> 0:3:28,3
But we also have our rights
to hang with our


69
0:3:28,3 --> 0:3:30,948
friends and have fun.


70
0:3:30,948 --> 0:3:33,49
KEVIN BLOWE: A lot of young
people are not prepared to put


71
0:3:33,49 --> 0:3:36,73
up with just being told what to
do, forcing people into a


72
0:3:36,73 --> 0:3:39,26
situation where they get into
conflict with the police.


73
0:3:39,26 --> 0:3:41,46
A natural consequence of that
is people end up being


74
0:3:41,46 --> 0:3:41,83
criminalized.


75
0:3:41,83 --> 0:3:43,8
People end up in court.


76
0:3:43,8 --> 0:3:48,245



77
0:3:48,245 --> 0:3:51,57
MALE SPEAKER: We should have a
right to be around where we


78
0:3:51,57 --> 0:3:53,67
live and hang around our area.


79
0:3:53,67 --> 0:3:58,797



80
0:3:58,797 --> 0:4:1,61
LEAH BORROMEO: Do Londoners
feel safer when they're


81
0:4:1,61 --> 0:4:4,28
walking through the streets and
they suddenly find armed


82
0:4:4,28 --> 0:4:5,48
police with big guns?


83
0:4:5,48 --> 0:4:8,97
I mean, not in a country that
rather prides itself in having


84
0:4:8,97 --> 0:4:10,56
an unarmed police force.


85
0:4:10,56 --> 0:4:13,29
However, we are already the
most surveyed society.


86
0:4:13,29 --> 0:4:16,5
We've now got drones coming
in over the sky.


87
0:4:16,5 --> 0:4:18,79
You hear the sounds of
military helicopters.


88
0:4:18,79 --> 0:4:20,849
Do we really want to be
living in a kind of


89
0:4:20,849 --> 0:4:22,73
Ridley Scott wet dream?


90
0:4:22,73 --> 0:4:28,478



91
0:4:28,478 --> 0:4:31,32
BRIAN WHELAN: Well, starting
from tomorrow, there's going


92
0:4:31,32 --> 0:4:37,68
to be armed police at my door,
10 soldiers stationed, 24/7,


93
0:4:37,68 --> 0:4:41,46
at the end of the corridor, and
a battery of missiles on


94
0:4:41,46 --> 0:4:44,2
the roof of the water tower
above my apartment.


95
0:4:44,2 --> 0:4:46,7
If you look at the Olympic site,
the first thing you see


96
0:4:46,7 --> 0:4:48,52
is my building and the roof
of that water tower.


97
0:4:48,52 --> 0:4:50,19
Maybe if you see missiles
on the top of that,


98
0:4:50,19 --> 0:4:51,33
maybe you feel safe.


99
0:4:51,33 --> 0:4:54,8
If the [INAUDIBLE] comes out and
says, look, we're putting


100
0:4:54,8 --> 0:4:57,27
missiles on the roof of people's
houses, it makes it


101
0:4:57,27 --> 0:4:59,35
look like they're really
serious about security.


102
0:4:59,35 --> 0:5:4,8
But I think the proper work of
keeping the Olympics safe is


103
0:5:4,8 --> 0:5:4,8
done elsewhere.


104
0:5:4,8 --> 0:5:7,685
Those missiles are
just for show.


105
0:5:7,685 --> 0:5:7,781
LT.


106
0:5:7,781 --> 0:5:7,877
COL.


107
0:5:7,877 --> 0:5:10,66
JAMES PHILLIPS: Behind me, we
have the Rapier Air Defense


108
0:5:10,66 --> 0:5:11,89
missile system.


109
0:5:11,89 --> 0:5:14,72
Four of those will be deployed
on Exercise Olympic Guardian.


110
0:5:14,72 --> 0:5:17,8
There is no specific threat
against the Olympics in terms


111
0:5:17,8 --> 0:5:18,9
of an air threat.


112
0:5:18,9 --> 0:5:19,69
This is purely a contingency.


113
0:5:19,69 --> 0:5:22,29
But obviously we need
to prepare for if


114
0:5:22,29 --> 0:5:23,54
that order does come.


115
0:5:23,54 --> 0:5:27,625



116
0:5:27,625 --> 0:5:29,97
KEVIN BLOWE: Overall security
for the Olympic Park has


117
0:5:29,97 --> 0:5:31,69
increased from round
about 4,000 to


118
0:5:31,69 --> 0:5:33,75
somewhere like 23,000.


119
0:5:33,75 --> 0:5:37,67
Which includes G4S, the police,
the army, in uniform,


120
0:5:37,67 --> 0:5:39,7
and then all the other security


121
0:5:39,7 --> 0:5:41,3
from private sponsors.


122
0:5:41,3 --> 0:5:44,83
500 FBI agents coming over with
the team from the US.


123
0:5:44,83 --> 0:5:47,19
It's complete overkill for
what is a sporting event.


124
0:5:47,19 --> 0:5:49,92
The security is predominantly
about defending the interests


125
0:5:49,92 --> 0:5:52,55
of the money that's gone
into the Olympics.


126
0:5:52,55 --> 0:5:53,534
PROTESTORS: G4S!


127
0:5:53,534 --> 0:5:55,1
You can't hide!


128
0:5:55,1 --> 0:5:57,962
We charge you with aparthied!


129
0:5:57,962 --> 0:5:59,18
G4S!


130
0:5:59,18 --> 0:6:0,8
You can't hide!


131
0:6:0,8 --> 0:6:3,38
We charge you with aparthied!


132
0:6:3,38 --> 0:6:5,16
MICHAEL DEAS: There's lots
of lovely things


133
0:6:5,16 --> 0:6:7,0
said about the Olympics.


134
0:6:7,0 --> 0:6:10,57
But if you're hiring a company
to provide the security that's


135
0:6:10,57 --> 0:6:13,92
involved in supporting Israeli
apartheid, that's involved in


136
0:6:13,92 --> 0:6:18,0
exploiting prisoners in the UK,
it's killed asylum seekers


137
0:6:18,0 --> 0:6:20,59
and immigrants in the UK, then
I think that's really


138
0:6:20,59 --> 0:6:22,445
undermining the message
of the Olympics.


139
0:6:22,445 --> 0:6:25,37
SARA CALLAWAY: In the case of
Jimmy Mubenga, the officers


140
0:6:25,37 --> 0:6:28,91
deporting him pushed his head
down, they kept him in a


141
0:6:28,91 --> 0:6:30,16
position where he asphyxiated.


142
0:6:30,16 --> 0:6:33,6



143
0:6:33,6 --> 0:6:35,34
G4S claimed that they've
done nothing wrong.


144
0:6:35,34 --> 0:6:38,48
But even their own employees
came forward, saying that they


145
0:6:38,48 --> 0:6:41,93
were doing this all the time--
these very violent and


146
0:6:41,93 --> 0:6:43,3
basically murderous
procedures.


147
0:6:43,3 --> 0:6:51,32



148
0:6:51,32 --> 0:6:53,48
STEPHEN BAYLEY: Any sane person
could be against the


149
0:6:53,48 --> 0:6:54,85
idea of the Olympics.


150
0:6:54,85 --> 0:6:58,45
Anything which brings prosperity
and vitality and


151
0:6:58,45 --> 0:7:2,65
activity to London is obviously
a good thing.


152
0:7:2,65 --> 0:7:5,84
However, that said, if you are
a fastidious aesthete--


153
0:7:5,84 --> 0:7:8,75
which is one of several
definitions I apply to


154
0:7:8,75 --> 0:7:13,29
myself-- if you are a fastidious
aesthete, you can


155
0:7:13,29 --> 0:7:17,7
only be appalled at the
brainless detritus which the


156
0:7:17,7 --> 0:7:20,35
Olympics generate.


157
0:7:20,35 --> 0:7:23,74
I was recently described as
a ubiquitous know-it-all.


158
0:7:23,74 --> 0:7:25,97
I'm an author and journalist,
but in the past I was


159
0:7:25,97 --> 0:7:28,42
responsible for making London's
design museum.


160
0:7:28,42 --> 0:7:31,44
I was briefly, hilariously,
and catastrophically the


161
0:7:31,44 --> 0:7:34,1
creative director of the
Millennium Dome.


162
0:7:34,1 --> 0:7:37,74
And that gave me special
insights into politicized


163
0:7:37,74 --> 0:7:40,35
projects, which often
end in disaster.


164
0:7:40,35 --> 0:7:42,79
I'm an expert on those.


165
0:7:42,79 --> 0:7:47,11
And what's deplorable about the
Olympic merchandise, and


166
0:7:47,11 --> 0:7:51,21
the terrible graphics going with
it, it assumes a very low


167
0:7:51,21 --> 0:7:53,36
level of intelligence
amongst the public.


168
0:7:53,36 --> 0:7:58,39
And I think that is
really despicable.


169
0:7:58,39 --> 0:8:1,79
Look upon my works, ye
mighty, and despair.


170
0:8:1,79 --> 0:8:4,42
I think the idea that the
mascot's there to excite


171
0:8:4,42 --> 0:8:7,21
younger children reveals the
deplorable ignorance of how


172
0:8:7,21 --> 0:8:9,26
intelligent and sensitive
young children are.


173
0:8:9,26 --> 0:8:10,87
Young children are
not moronic.


174
0:8:10,87 --> 0:8:14,1
But I think some parts of the
Olympic organizing committee


175
0:8:14,1 --> 0:8:15,9
probably are moronic.


176
0:8:15,9 --> 0:8:19,42
How is the person who consumes
this bit of tat going to be


177
0:8:19,42 --> 0:8:21,66
changed or enhanced by
possession of it?


178
0:8:21,66 --> 0:8:25,58
It's ugly, it's cynical,
and it's stupid.


179
0:8:25,58 --> 0:8:28,44
Several design principles
have been violated here.


180
0:8:28,44 --> 0:8:30,72
This is an ugly travesty.


181
0:8:30,72 --> 0:8:36,33
Mindless, stupid, cynical,
patronizing, exploitative,


182
0:8:36,33 --> 0:8:39,47
manipulative, ugly,
and useless.


183
0:8:39,47 --> 0:8:42,559
We want to revive our industry
and revive the credibility of


184
0:8:42,559 --> 0:8:47,2
our great nation by putting
something like this for sale?


185
0:8:47,2 --> 0:8:50,63
I mean, what purpose is
this meant to serve?


186
0:8:50,63 --> 0:8:52,6
It's not a clever photograph.


187
0:8:52,6 --> 0:8:56,26
And it shows this sort of
laborious conceit of the


188
0:8:56,26 --> 0:8:59,88
London eye as a target.


189
0:8:59,88 --> 0:9:2,57
Given the ever-present threat
of terrorist activity, that


190
0:9:2,57 --> 0:9:6,84
seems to me to be an unfortunate
lapse of taste.


191
0:9:6,84 --> 0:9:10,63
But I think al Qaeda, their
aesthetics are too advanced to


192
0:9:10,63 --> 0:9:12,32
take much interest in
this sort of thing.


193
0:9:12,32 --> 0:9:16,1
The local Olympic organizers
seem to think that the public


194
0:9:16,1 --> 0:9:21,15
has absolutely no appetite for
thoughtful speculation about


195
0:9:21,15 --> 0:9:23,73
what the Olympics might be,
about what competition might


196
0:9:23,73 --> 0:9:27,31
be, about the nature of sport,
the nature of participative


197
0:9:27,31 --> 0:9:31,66
activity, the symbolic
importance of the games in a


198
0:9:31,66 --> 0:9:32,64
modern culture.


199
0:9:32,64 --> 0:9:36,1
Instead, what the public, they
think, needs is distorted,


200
0:9:36,1 --> 0:9:39,85
debased Smurfs which you can
hang on a key rings.


201
0:9:39,85 --> 0:9:41,1
Appalling.


202
0:9:41,1 --> 0:9:44,274



203
0:9:44,274 --> 0:9:47,2
MALE SPEAKER: I would
say I'm a pinhead.


204
0:9:47,2 --> 0:9:49,46
I've been called
a pinhead, yes.


205
0:9:49,46 --> 0:9:51,67
It's more than just
collecting pins.


206
0:9:51,67 --> 0:9:52,93
It breaks down barriers.


207
0:9:52,93 --> 0:9:55,535
It makes it easy for people
to meet each other.


208
0:9:55,535 --> 0:9:58,66
MALE SPEAKER: This is now the
eighth meet that we've had.


209
0:9:58,66 --> 0:10:0,72
For me, the pins are
a tangible memento.


210
0:10:0,72 --> 0:10:1,92
This has really taken
over my life.


211
0:10:1,92 --> 0:10:4,4
MALE SPEAKER: The reason
I love this logo--


212
0:10:4,4 --> 0:10:6,28
one, it's very, very
distinctive.


213
0:10:6,28 --> 0:10:7,91
Two, it's creative.


214
0:10:7,91 --> 0:10:11,7
Absolutely amazing level
of discussion over it.


215
0:10:11,7 --> 0:10:13,8
I think when it first
came out, we all


216
0:10:13,8 --> 0:10:14,5
said ew, what's that?


217
0:10:14,5 --> 0:10:15,31
That's not a great look.


218
0:10:15,31 --> 0:10:17,98
Over time, we've come to
accept it a lot more.


219
0:10:17,98 --> 0:10:20,69
Given what we have the
marketplace, I think our logo


220
0:10:20,69 --> 0:10:21,63
is pretty good.


221
0:10:21,63 --> 0:10:24,18
MALE SPEAKER: It's going to
become the biggest global


222
0:10:24,18 --> 0:10:28,54
brand this year because of the
London 2012 Olympic Games.


223
0:10:28,54 --> 0:12:28,54
