1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:6,874



2
0:0:6,874 --> 0:0:8,347
DUSTIN DOLLIN: I'm
going too fast.


3
0:0:8,347 --> 0:0:10,42
(SINGING) Little red corvette.


4
0:0:10,42 --> 0:0:14,765



5
0:0:14,765 --> 0:0:16,96
See if you can hear me.


6
0:0:16,96 --> 0:0:16,87
PATRICK O'DELL: Yeah
I can hear you.


7
0:0:16,87 --> 0:0:18,6
DUSTIN DOLLIN: Can
you hear me?


8
0:0:18,6 --> 0:0:20,0
Is that way better?


9
0:0:20,0 --> 0:0:21,45
Can you hear me now?


10
0:0:21,45 --> 0:0:23,95



11
0:0:23,95 --> 0:0:26,146
Aren't you the fucking filmer?


12
0:0:26,146 --> 0:0:29,2
I'm just a puppet.


13
0:0:29,2 --> 0:0:29,25
PATRICK O'DELL: Hi.


14
0:0:29,25 --> 0:0:32,18
Welcome to the very first
episode of the Epicly Later'd


15
0:0:32,18 --> 0:0:33,24
skateboard show.


16
0:0:33,24 --> 0:0:36,5
Today as our first guest we
have Dustin Dollin who's


17
0:0:36,5 --> 0:0:37,83
visiting from Australia.


18
0:0:37,83 --> 0:0:41,8
And I'm really excited because
Dustin is just like an awesome


19
0:0:41,8 --> 0:0:43,68
skater and he's an
insane person.


20
0:0:43,68 --> 0:0:45,27
DUSTIN DOLLIN: This
way or that way?


21
0:0:45,27 --> 0:0:47,69
PATRICK O'DELL: He's completely
fearless and for


22
0:0:47,69 --> 0:0:50,65
years has just been doing stuff
that I think has pushed


23
0:0:50,65 --> 0:0:52,12
progression in skateboarding
ahead.


24
0:0:52,12 --> 0:0:53,46
Always getting tricks done.


25
0:0:53,46 --> 0:0:55,68
Always landing everything.


26
0:0:55,68 --> 0:0:58,56
We're just hoping to follow him
around, go gear shopping,


27
0:0:58,56 --> 0:0:59,48
skateboarding.


28
0:0:59,48 --> 0:0:59,86
I don't know.


29
0:0:59,86 --> 0:1:1,67
We'll see what we get into.


30
0:1:1,67 --> 0:1:6,87
This is sort of a day in the
life of Dustin Dollin.


31
0:1:6,87 --> 0:1:7,83
DUSTIN DOLLIN: The fucking--


32
0:1:7,83 --> 0:1:10,23
it's so hard to find a button-up
with like one pocket


33
0:1:10,23 --> 0:1:11,72
with a good print on
it these days.


34
0:1:11,72 --> 0:1:15,44
They're all like polyester
fuckin' fag seventies shit.


35
0:1:15,44 --> 0:1:18,484
And they have that dude
downstairs, the crazy dude


36
0:1:18,484 --> 0:1:20,285
that's been here forever.


37
0:1:20,285 --> 0:1:22,19
Do you have these in a small?


38
0:1:22,19 --> 0:1:23,45
MALE SPEAKER 2: In a small?


39
0:1:23,45 --> 0:1:26,2
DUSTIN DOLLIN: No, it's just
what's on the shelf, right?


40
0:1:26,2 --> 0:1:27,54
I like this kind of shit.


41
0:1:27,54 --> 0:1:28,34
[INAUDIBLE].


42
0:1:28,34 --> 0:1:32,89
Just like the old Gothic
wallpaper kind of shirt.


43
0:1:32,89 --> 0:1:34,2
MALE SPEAKER 2: Too Gothic?


44
0:1:34,2 --> 0:1:35,505
DUSTIN DOLLIN: Yep.


45
0:1:35,505 --> 0:1:38,7
MALE SPEAKER 2: Here you go!


46
0:1:38,7 --> 0:1:40,81
DUSTIN DOLLIN: It's
a bit hot though.


47
0:1:40,81 --> 0:1:41,175
MALE SPEAKER 2: Right.


48
0:1:41,175 --> 0:1:42,8
It's supposed to be hot.


49
0:1:42,8 --> 0:1:44,45
Like in rock-n-roll it's hot.


50
0:1:44,45 --> 0:1:47,2
If it's not hot, what's
the point?


51
0:1:47,2 --> 0:1:49,46
Like if your pants don't
hurt, why wear them?


52
0:1:49,46 --> 0:1:51,3
We carry this thing, that's
Dustin Dollin.


53
0:1:51,3 --> 0:1:52,73
I even know your
last name now.


54
0:1:52,73 --> 0:1:53,133
DUSTIN DOLLIN: Oh really.


55
0:1:53,133 --> 0:1:53,94
MALE SPEAKER 2: You're famous.


56
0:1:53,94 --> 0:1:54,23
Yeah.


57
0:1:54,23 --> 0:1:55,45
Upstairs you're famous.


58
0:1:55,45 --> 0:1:55,38
He's famous.


59
0:1:55,38 --> 0:1:56,82
He's really famous.


60
0:1:56,82 --> 0:1:57,34
DUSTIN DOLLIN: No.


61
0:1:57,34 --> 0:1:58,5
MALE SPEAKER 2: Yes!


62
0:1:58,5 --> 0:1:58,9
DUSTIN DOLLIN: I'm not.


63
0:1:58,9 --> 0:2:1,238
MALE SPEAKER 2: Humbly famous.


64
0:2:1,238 --> 0:2:3,4
DUSTIN DOLLIN: Ah, [INAUDIBLE]
mob blocks.


65
0:2:3,4 --> 0:2:5,5
These are mob blocks.


66
0:2:5,5 --> 0:2:7,982
Trying to get shit done with
these is virtually impossible.


67
0:2:7,982 --> 0:2:10,19
[BELCHING]


68
0:2:10,19 --> 0:2:13,2
It's so funny letting
a [INAUDIBLE].


69
0:2:13,2 --> 0:2:15,376
Hated and proud and then
like cover it up


70
0:2:15,376 --> 0:2:16,626
with my chick socks.


71
0:2:16,626 --> 0:2:19,24



72
0:2:19,24 --> 0:2:21,33
SHANNON MARTINEZ: I got nothing
to say right now.


73
0:2:21,33 --> 0:2:21,92
I'm jealous.


74
0:2:21,92 --> 0:2:23,27
I don't have any shoes.


75
0:2:23,27 --> 0:2:24,62
DUSTIN DOLLIN: I feel so
much better actually


76
0:2:24,62 --> 0:2:26,4
having some gear on.


77
0:2:26,4 --> 0:2:28,13
It's been so long.


78
0:2:28,13 --> 0:2:32,8
It's been skate dude on tour for
fucking months and months.


79
0:2:32,8 --> 0:2:35,36
Thank you.


80
0:2:35,36 --> 0:2:37,41
CHAD MUSKA: I know one good
story about Dustin.


81
0:2:37,41 --> 0:2:39,48
When we first met, the first
time I went to Australia, it


82
0:2:39,48 --> 0:2:40,79
was me and Ronnie Creager.


83
0:2:40,79 --> 0:2:43,55
We went on-- it was a
Blind Shorties tour.


84
0:2:43,55 --> 0:2:47,76
And we went to every fuckin'
place in Australia, Justin was


85
0:2:47,76 --> 0:2:49,83
probably like 11 or 12 years
old or something.


86
0:2:49,83 --> 0:2:53,26
And he showed up at every spot
that went to, no matter if we


87
0:2:53,26 --> 0:2:57,2
were on the other side-- we were
in Tasmania, to Perth, to


88
0:2:57,2 --> 0:2:59,91
Adelaide, and he showed up at
every demo and he was the


89
0:2:59,91 --> 0:3:1,93
hyperest little shit
in the world.


90
0:3:1,93 --> 0:3:4,47
And he was kickflip indy
grabbing everything in sight


91
0:3:4,47 --> 0:3:7,0
and he was just like, ah, hey
mate, hey check this kickflip


92
0:3:7,0 --> 0:3:8,0
indy, aye, aye, aye.


93
0:3:8,0 --> 0:3:9,16
And he was kickflipping
everything.


94
0:3:9,16 --> 0:3:12,23
He was just this hyper
little fucking rat.


95
0:3:12,23 --> 0:3:14,25
And then I just remember like
a couple of years after that


96
0:3:14,25 --> 0:3:16,36
just seeing him and damn,
he really fuckin'


97
0:3:16,36 --> 0:3:16,85
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.


98
0:3:16,85 --> 0:3:17,53
CHAD MUSKA: Came through.


99
0:3:17,53 --> 0:3:17,87
You know?


100
0:3:17,87 --> 0:3:21,2
But I think like he's one of the
sickest skaters ever right


101
0:3:21,2 --> 0:3:22,76
now, for sure, man.


102
0:3:22,76 --> 0:3:23,9
PATRICK O'DELL: To me, something
that's interesting


103
0:3:23,9 --> 0:3:26,89
about Dustin Dollin is that a
lot of pro skaters when they


104
0:3:26,89 --> 0:3:29,65
turn old enough to start
drinking they start drinking,


105
0:3:29,65 --> 0:3:32,6
they start doing drugs, they
just vanish off the face of


106
0:3:32,6 --> 0:3:34,755
the earth as far as
skateboarding coverage goes.


107
0:3:34,755 --> 0:3:37,48
DUSTIN DOLLIN: I'm gonna
get run over by cars.


108
0:3:37,48 --> 0:3:40,82
PATRICK O'DELL: Dustin has never
slowed down partying and


109
0:3:40,82 --> 0:3:42,49
he's never slowed down
skateboarding.


110
0:3:42,49 --> 0:3:44,82
And I know that might be a bad
message because trust me,


111
0:3:44,82 --> 0:3:48,14
nobody else has been able to
pull this off and I've seen


112
0:3:48,14 --> 0:3:50,72
pros come and go for 10 years.


113
0:3:50,72 --> 0:3:53,37
He's always the first one awake
in the morning and the


114
0:3:53,37 --> 0:3:54,27
last one asleep.


115
0:3:54,27 --> 0:3:56,254
[CAR HORN]


116
0:3:56,254 --> 0:3:58,238
DUSTIN DOLLIN: Fuck off!


117
0:3:58,238 --> 0:3:59,23
Fuckin' hell!


118
0:3:59,23 --> 0:4:1,7
What the fuck's wrong
with these people?


119
0:4:1,7 --> 0:4:3,35
PATRICK O'DELL: He just seems
to have this lust for life


120
0:4:3,35 --> 0:4:5,92
that a lot of people
don't have.


121
0:4:5,92 --> 0:4:7,95
DUSTIN DOLLIN: When you like
walk past the bar and they're


122
0:4:7,95 --> 0:4:9,922
playing a song that you really
like you just got to go in and


123
0:4:9,922 --> 0:4:11,87
have a drink.


124
0:4:11,87 --> 0:4:13,99
KEVIN "SPANKY" LONG: Dustin's
like the king of pressuring


125
0:4:13,99 --> 0:4:15,26
people who don't drink.


126
0:4:15,26 --> 0:4:18,23
He seriously has a hard time
breathing when he's around


127
0:4:18,23 --> 0:4:21,5
people who we know
that don't drink.


128
0:4:21,5 --> 0:4:22,26
DUSTIN DOLLIN: One time me and
Spanky were in Brooklyn and


129
0:4:22,26 --> 0:4:25,42
we're just like walking down
the street talking to each


130
0:4:25,42 --> 0:4:27,49
like, man, I got to
take it easy.


131
0:4:27,49 --> 0:4:31,2
I got to slow down on having
drinks like this week.


132
0:4:31,2 --> 0:4:33,86
And then we walk past a bar and
Morrissey was playing out


133
0:4:33,86 --> 0:4:35,72
of it and we just had to
go in and have a drink.


134
0:4:35,72 --> 0:4:38,38



135
0:4:38,38 --> 0:4:39,8
Times like that, you know?


136
0:4:39,8 --> 0:4:41,99
KEVIN "SPANKY" LONG: I guess
he probably taught me a new


137
0:4:41,99 --> 0:4:45,6
way to drink or like--


138
0:4:45,6 --> 0:4:47,576
DUSTIN DOLLIN: Afternoon
mimosa, huh?


139
0:4:47,576 --> 0:4:48,35
FEMALE SPEAKER: Why not?


140
0:4:48,35 --> 0:4:48,58
DUSTIN DOLLIN: Yeah.


141
0:4:48,58 --> 0:4:49,266
Why not.


142
0:4:49,266 --> 0:4:50,506
FEMALE SPEAKER: I'm
gonna find me some


143
0:4:50,506 --> 0:4:53,234
nice big, giant mojito.


144
0:4:53,234 --> 0:4:56,21
DUSTIN DOLLIN: Oh, yeah.


145
0:4:56,21 --> 0:5:0,21
She's like mimosa
and a mojito.


146
0:5:0,21 --> 0:5:1,9
I need some washing man.


147
0:5:1,9 --> 0:5:4,77



148
0:5:4,77 --> 0:5:9,2
It said same day on the
laundromat and then the next


149
0:5:9,2 --> 0:5:12,528
day you have to pick it up.


150
0:5:12,528 --> 0:5:14,95
I don't know, it's fucked.


151
0:5:14,95 --> 0:5:14,78
You know what else I hate?


152
0:5:14,78 --> 0:5:18,43
Is in the elevators, they have
the button that closes the


153
0:5:18,43 --> 0:5:21,53
door quicker but it never
fucking closes it quicker.


154
0:5:21,53 --> 0:5:22,84
Never.


155
0:5:22,84 --> 0:5:25,54
Guys that wear their sunglasses
on their head,


156
0:5:25,54 --> 0:5:28,44
that's pretty heinous,
especially at night.


157
0:5:28,44 --> 0:5:28,94
That's bad.


158
0:5:28,94 --> 0:5:32,84
People wear strange
gear in New York.


159
0:5:32,84 --> 0:5:36,2
I seen girls like wearing
most old grandmother


160
0:5:36,2 --> 0:5:37,54
fucking shit ever.


161
0:5:37,54 --> 0:5:41,1
Like the prettiest girls just
like ruining their shit by


162
0:5:41,1 --> 0:5:45,96
wearing these big flowery
grandmother dresses.


163
0:5:45,96 --> 0:5:47,9
It's stupid.


164
0:5:47,9 --> 0:5:50,56
Lot of girls cover up their tits
here like they don't like


165
0:5:50,56 --> 0:5:51,47
showing any of them.


166
0:5:51,47 --> 0:5:53,8
I think it's because they're
all models and they're all


167
0:5:53,8 --> 0:5:55,544
skinny and they all
got little tits.


168
0:5:55,544 --> 0:5:58,38
I hate lots of things though.


169
0:5:58,38 --> 0:5:59,87
I'm sure a lot of people
just hate me.


170
0:5:59,87 --> 0:6:4,64



171
0:6:4,64 --> 0:6:5,94
Fuck 'em.


172
0:6:5,94 --> 0:6:6,64
Two for one.


173
0:6:6,64 --> 0:6:7,33
I guess I can get my--


174
0:6:7,33 --> 0:6:9,42
[BELCHING]


175
0:6:9,42 --> 0:6:10,97
Get another one for free.


176
0:6:10,97 --> 0:6:12,71
PATRICK O'DELL: When did
you first meet Dustin?


177
0:6:12,71 --> 0:6:14,62
SHANNON MARTINEZ: Almost seven
years ago at a bar in


178
0:6:14,62 --> 0:6:16,71
Melbourne, in Australia.


179
0:6:16,71 --> 0:6:20,43
We pretty much met because he
ran after me and pulled down


180
0:6:20,43 --> 0:6:24,73
my skirt in front of all the
Baker crew and through a drink


181
0:6:24,73 --> 0:6:31,23
on my face and I liked it
so that's how we met.


182
0:6:31,23 --> 0:6:33,18
PATRICK O'DELL: And you guys
started dating right away?


183
0:6:33,18 --> 0:6:33,59
SHANNON MARTINEZ: Yep.


184
0:6:33,59 --> 0:6:36,1
I moved to Sydney after pretty
much knowing him for a day.


185
0:6:36,1 --> 0:6:38,62
So I moved into state
to live with him for


186
0:6:38,62 --> 0:6:40,11
awhile during the Olympics.


187
0:6:40,11 --> 0:6:42,29
And then I made him come
back down to Melbourne.


188
0:6:42,29 --> 0:6:43,686
And he's been there
ever since.


189
0:6:43,686 --> 0:6:45,4
DUSTIN DOLLIN: I'm always
here just drinking.


190
0:6:45,4 --> 0:6:47,13
I don't know where all you kids
are every other fucking


191
0:6:47,13 --> 0:6:50,824
time where I was hanging out
at Tompkins having beers.


192
0:6:50,824 --> 0:6:53,23
I didn't think anyone even
liked me in New York.


193
0:6:53,23 --> 0:6:56,29



194
0:6:56,29 --> 0:6:58,6
Professional pile of shit.


195
0:6:58,6 --> 0:6:59,88
PATRICK O'DELL: Did he make some
kind of deal with you,


196
0:6:59,88 --> 0:7:1,63
like if you put up with him?


197
0:7:1,63 --> 0:7:4,326
SHANNON MARTINEZ: For five
years he'd marry me?


198
0:7:4,326 --> 0:7:6,2
Yeah!


199
0:7:6,2 --> 0:7:7,9
PATRICK O'DELL: What
did he say?


200
0:7:7,9 --> 0:7:8,66
How did he put it to you?


201
0:7:8,66 --> 0:7:10,96
SHANNON MARTINEZ: I actually
read it in a magazine.


202
0:7:10,96 --> 0:7:13,29
I never heard of the deal.


203
0:7:13,29 --> 0:7:15,47
He made up the deal in a
magazine and then I read it


204
0:7:15,47 --> 0:7:18,5
and he told me that's what was
going to happen so I don't


205
0:7:18,5 --> 0:7:22,39
know if that's like a prize
or punishment or what.


206
0:7:22,39 --> 0:7:24,0
PATRICK O'DELL: How much
shit do you think you


207
0:7:24,0 --> 0:7:25,91
have to put up with?


208
0:7:25,91 --> 0:7:27,16
SHANNON MARTINEZ: More
than anyone else.


209
0:7:27,16 --> 0:7:28,39
PATRICK O'DELL: Do you think
maybe it's almost a relief


210
0:7:28,39 --> 0:7:29,41
when he goes on tour?


211
0:7:29,41 --> 0:7:29,81
SHANNON MARTINEZ: Definitely.


212
0:7:29,81 --> 0:7:31,99
It's the only reason why
we're together still.


213
0:7:31,99 --> 0:7:33,87
We usually see each other
between eight--


214
0:7:33,87 --> 0:7:34,92
around eight months a year.


215
0:7:34,92 --> 0:7:37,18
And if we didn't have the
breaks, we'd kill each other.


216
0:7:37,18 --> 0:7:38,9
Because he's way
too torturous.


217
0:7:38,9 --> 0:7:39,74
24 hours a day?


218
0:7:39,74 --> 0:7:41,55
There's no way.


219
0:7:41,55 --> 0:7:42,89
No way.


220
0:7:42,89 --> 0:7:44,43
DUSTIN DOLLIN: Now
what do we do?


221
0:7:44,43 --> 0:7:45,68
Let's go get a beer.


222
0:7:45,68 --> 0:7:48,88



223
0:7:48,88 --> 0:7:52,95
Trying not to throw up, man.


224
0:7:52,95 --> 0:7:54,85
I need to go somewhere
private to throw up.


225
0:7:54,85 --> 0:7:56,126
I got to go throw up.


226
0:7:56,126 --> 0:8:3,566
[GAGGING]


227
0:8:3,566 --> 0:8:10,52
[VOMITING]


228
0:8:10,52 --> 0:8:12,515
Kids running over to take
pictures of me throwing up.


229
0:8:12,515 --> 0:8:13,86
That's great.


230
0:8:13,86 --> 0:8:14,89
PATRICK O'DELL: What do you
think of Dustin Dollin?


231
0:8:14,89 --> 0:8:16,47
TIM O'CONNOR: I like
that dude, yep.


232
0:8:16,47 --> 0:8:19,94
Plus he doesn't really give a
flying fuck about anything.


233
0:8:19,94 --> 0:8:23,2
A lot of people say they don't
give a fuck but he most


234
0:8:23,2 --> 0:8:25,46
definitely doesn't, for sure.


235
0:8:25,46 --> 0:8:29,51
DUSTIN DOLLIN: We're doing a
documentary on me drinking.


236
0:8:29,51 --> 0:8:31,808
It's going very well.


237
0:8:31,808 --> 0:8:32,292
FEMALE SPEAKER: It's
going to be great.


238
0:8:32,292 --> 0:8:33,26
MALE SPEAKER: Dustin, nice
meeting you, man.


239
0:8:33,26 --> 0:8:34,539
DUSTIN DOLLIN: You too, man.


240
0:8:34,539 --> 0:8:35,789
See ya.


241
0:8:35,789 --> 0:8:46,323



242
0:8:46,323 --> 0:8:49,76
Tell them what the fuck you're
wearing I mean while you're


243
0:8:49,76 --> 0:8:51,233
getting it on your ears.


244
0:8:51,233 --> 0:8:53,69
SHANNON MARTINEZ: Huh?


245
0:8:53,69 --> 0:8:56,8
Are you wasted right now
after like five beers?


246
0:8:56,8 --> 0:8:59,555
DUSTIN DOLLIN: Three Jagers.


247
0:8:59,555 --> 0:9:1,5
Can I get a tattoo?


248
0:9:1,5 --> 0:9:2,62
FEMALE SPEAKER: Which
you want?


249
0:9:2,62 --> 0:9:5,44
DUSTIN DOLLIN: A skull and
crossbones in my earlobe.


250
0:9:5,44 --> 0:9:6,91
SHANNON MARTINEZ: No.


251
0:9:6,91 --> 0:9:7,89
You don't do it there?


252
0:9:7,89 --> 0:9:9,85
FEMALE SPEAKER: I've never
tattooed there before.


253
0:9:9,85 --> 0:9:12,3
Inside the ear is like way
different than below here.


254
0:9:12,3 --> 0:9:15,24
I'm game if you are.


255
0:9:15,24 --> 0:9:17,622
DUSTIN DOLLIN: Isn't there a gay
side and a non-gay side?


256
0:9:17,622 --> 0:9:18,114
FEMALE SPEAKER: You know what?


257
0:9:18,114 --> 0:9:20,82
I wish I knew the
answer to that.


258
0:9:20,82 --> 0:9:20,955
SHANNON MARTINEZ: The
left, apparently.


259
0:9:20,955 --> 0:9:21,828
DUSTIN DOLLIN: The
left is non-gay?


260
0:9:21,828 --> 0:9:23,322
SHANNON MARTINEZ: Yeah,
apparently.


261
0:9:23,322 --> 0:9:24,816
FEMALE SPEAKER: The left
side is non-gay?


262
0:9:24,816 --> 0:9:26,66
DUSTIN DOLLIN: Well I want to
get it on the gay side.


263
0:9:26,66 --> 0:9:30,6



264
0:9:30,6 --> 0:9:31,562
I can't get it right.


265
0:9:31,562 --> 0:9:34,207
The pen's not thin enough but
I guess that's how thick


266
0:9:34,207 --> 0:9:34,94
tattoos are.


267
0:9:34,94 --> 0:9:37,2
MALE SPEAKER: You should
get that one.


268
0:9:37,2 --> 0:9:39,4
Rat bone.


269
0:9:39,4 --> 0:9:40,91
DUSTIN DOLLIN: It's got
to be really tiny.


270
0:9:40,91 --> 0:9:43,29
MALE SPEAKER: You want
it that small?


271
0:9:43,29 --> 0:9:44,54
DUSTIN DOLLIN: I'm gonna
out it in my ear.


272
0:9:44,54 --> 0:9:46,87



273
0:9:46,87 --> 0:9:49,1
All these skulls look gay.


274
0:9:49,1 --> 0:9:53,33
We need an evil skull.


275
0:9:53,33 --> 0:9:53,91
That's good.


276
0:9:53,91 --> 0:9:55,636
Even just that is good.


277
0:9:55,636 --> 0:10:5,9



278
0:10:5,9 --> 0:10:8,715
FEMALE SPEAKER: This is going
where inside your ear?


279
0:10:8,715 --> 0:10:10,655
DUSTIN DOLLIN: In there.


280
0:10:10,655 --> 0:10:12,11
MALE SPEAKER: You're
gonna go deaf.


281
0:10:12,11 --> 0:10:13,12
DUSTIN DOLLIN: Do you
think it'll work?


282
0:10:13,12 --> 0:10:14,473
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yes.


283
0:10:14,473 --> 0:10:17,63
DUSTIN DOLLIN: I bet
it won't hurt.


284
0:10:17,63 --> 0:10:19,18
Do you think it'll hurt?


285
0:10:19,18 --> 0:10:20,714
No, I ain't got no pain there.


286
0:10:20,714 --> 0:10:21,964
FEMALE SPEAKER: Really?


287
0:10:21,964 --> 0:10:36,55



288
0:10:36,55 --> 0:10:37,702
DUSTIN DOLLIN: It's all weird.


289
0:10:37,702 --> 0:10:40,52
It doesn't hurt.


290
0:10:40,52 --> 0:10:40,88
There's nothing.


291
0:10:40,88 --> 0:10:42,21
All you can hear is the sound.


292
0:10:42,21 --> 0:10:42,643
FEMALE SPEAKER: It's done.


293
0:10:42,643 --> 0:10:43,999
DUSTIN DOLLIN: And it's done.


294
0:10:43,999 --> 0:10:44,488
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.


295
0:10:44,488 --> 0:10:46,933
You're totally done.


296
0:10:46,933 --> 0:10:48,183
[INAUDIBLE].


297
0:10:48,183 --> 0:10:59,16



298
0:10:59,16 --> 0:11:0,2
JASON DILL: Dustin's rad, man.


299
0:11:0,2 --> 0:11:1,89
He's just-- he's so psycho.


300
0:11:1,89 --> 0:11:4,962
He'll be like hurt or whatever
and you'll think like, god


301
0:11:4,962 --> 0:11:7,32
dammit he can barely fucking
kickflip and all of a sudden


302
0:11:7,32 --> 0:11:8,7
he'll like, wah!


303
0:11:8,7 --> 0:11:12,34
Like fucking kickflip fucking
frontside flips on some big


304
0:11:12,34 --> 0:11:14,46
ass thing or into some big huge
thing and you're just


305
0:11:14,46 --> 0:11:15,45
like, holy shit!


306
0:11:15,45 --> 0:11:18,394
Yeah, he's a maniac.


307
0:11:18,394 --> 0:11:20,47
PATRICK O'DELL: So you think
with all this drinking and


308
0:11:20,47 --> 0:11:23,36
everything you still manage
to skate a lot?


309
0:11:23,36 --> 0:11:23,43
SHANNON MARTINEZ: Yeah.


310
0:11:23,43 --> 0:11:26,61
DUSTIN DOLLIN: I mean, I've had
knee surgery a couple of


311
0:11:26,61 --> 0:11:32,68
times, three times and I don't
know, I haven't slowed down.


312
0:11:32,68 --> 0:11:36,852
Still in all the magazines
like covers coming out.


313
0:11:36,852 --> 0:11:39,845
It doesn't really affect me.


314
0:11:39,845 --> 0:11:41,96
PATRICK O'DELL: You seem like
you're one of the few people


315
0:11:41,96 --> 0:11:44,904
that can get away with-- like
so many people that get into


316
0:11:44,904 --> 0:11:47,314
drinking and all this shit
and then they just


317
0:11:47,314 --> 0:11:48,205
vanish from the magazines.


318
0:11:48,205 --> 0:11:51,72
DUSTIN DOLLIN: Yeah, well, I
mean a lot of people are have


319
0:11:51,72 --> 0:11:54,99
addictive personalities and it
just fucks their life up but I


320
0:11:54,99 --> 0:11:56,556
can not drink, I can drink.


321
0:11:56,556 --> 0:12:0,13
I'd rather drink because a lot
to do with drinking is it


322
0:12:0,13 --> 0:12:2,31
makes me think of new
tricks to do.


323
0:12:2,31 --> 0:12:5,735
It makes me like-- when I wake
up hungover, I feel like doing


324
0:12:5,735 --> 0:12:7,2
something weird.


325
0:12:7,2 --> 0:12:7,74
I don't know.


326
0:12:7,74 --> 0:12:8,21
It's hard to explain.


327
0:12:8,21 --> 0:12:10,66
If I don't get a good night out,
it's hard for me to have


328
0:12:10,66 --> 0:12:11,71
fun the next day on
a skateboard.


329
0:12:11,71 --> 0:12:14,53
If I don't drink and I go
out the next day I'm


330
0:12:14,53 --> 0:12:17,7
just like, a zombie.


331
0:12:17,7 --> 0:12:20,3
And then if I drink and I'm
kind of still drunk in the


332
0:12:20,3 --> 0:12:22,71
morning I feel like jumping
off something.


333
0:12:22,71 --> 0:12:23,87
It's just the way it goes.


334
0:12:23,87 --> 0:12:25,39
KEVIN "SPANKY" LONG: He's
told me this before.


335
0:12:25,39 --> 0:12:27,93
He wakes up drunk and
drinks another beer


336
0:12:27,93 --> 0:12:30,33
and he skates better.


337
0:12:30,33 --> 0:12:32,93
And I've seen him go to a rail,
not be able to commit


338
0:12:32,93 --> 0:12:35,25
and he's like, oh no, I'll come
back with a few Jack and


339
0:12:35,25 --> 0:12:36,68
Cokes and I'll be
able to do it.


340
0:12:36,68 --> 0:12:39,61
And I believed him because
I've seen it happen.


341
0:12:39,61 --> 0:12:41,94
DUSTIN DOLLIN: Just drinking,
being hungover has never


342
0:12:41,94 --> 0:12:44,2
stopped me from trying to get
a trick before so I don't


343
0:12:44,2 --> 0:12:45,12
think it's going to stop
me ever unless--


344
0:12:45,12 --> 0:12:48,13
I'll skate as hard as I can
until my body will let me.


345
0:12:48,13 --> 0:14:48,13
