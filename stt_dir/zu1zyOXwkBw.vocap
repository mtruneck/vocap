###144 
###158  He used to love singing.
###161 I used to teach him little jingles,
###163 and he used to love them.
###166 And the chief one that he used to know was...
###168 I had a little donkey that's grey
###173 I feed him in a barn every day
###177 And when he hears me whistle he knows I have a thistle
###183 He'd rather eat a thistle than hay
###188 Hee-haw hee-haw
###191 Hee-haw hee-haw
###195 And that is all my donkey can say
###198 And then you would see him, you know, keeping time.
###202 And you would see that he was enjoying it.
###208  How did it all start?
###209 Had music always been a part of your life from when you were a little boy?
###219 What part of Jamaica?
###224 - Yeah?
###235  Well, you see, Bob Marley is my cousin, you know?
###275 - Bob liked to ride the donkey and, you know,
###278 go to the field with his grandfather and things like that.
###283 Because he's a country boy, you know.
###286  Nine Mile was a place that...
###289 there wasn't a lot of civilized activity.
###293 Electricity was not available in those areas,
###297 so you see a lot of "peeny wallies"... you know, those little fireflies.
###302 And that's the only light at night...
###305 other than the moon and the stars, you know.
###307 So, as a youth coming out of Kingston...
###310 that was accustomed to jukebox and sound system,
###313 it was really something to get accustomed to.
###320  And do you remember when you first met Robert?
###323 - Yes. First time I saw him, I saw this little youth...
###327 cutting up this big chunk of wood
###328 and putting it on his head bit by bit and taking it away...
###331 I say, that's... You know, and then...
###334 He was the only little, what you call it,
###337 red "pickney" in the place,
###339 because everybody else was black people.
###344  Who was Bob's dad?
###346 
###359  He liked when you call him "Captain."
###362 Yes, but his... his name is Norval.
###365 I met him right there in Nine Mile,
###369 and then as a white man in the district,
###371 you know, always ride his horse and things like that.
###374 He and my father becomes good friends.
###377 Then at that time he see this little girl and I guess he liked her, and, um,
###383 we finally get together and that's how it...
###386 that's how it happened.
###389  How old was your sister when she met the Captain?
###392 - She was, what, 16.
###395 Captain was... He was about in his 60s.
###400 - So he was an old man? - Yes.
###419 - My name is Peter Marley. Bob Marley is my second cousin.
###424  What did you know about Bob Marley's father?
###427  He rode a horse most of the time.
###430 He was in the British army.
###432 I think he was stationed somewhere in India in World War II...
###434 when he got shell shock.
###440 I understand he drank and that he lived a...
###443 What should I say?
###446 A full life.
###476  Did he get teased for being mixed?
###479 Yeah, sure. Worse than teased.
###482 Teased is not the word You call it rejected.
###487 He did everything that his bigger uncles should be doing...
###490 because it was their duty to move horses...
###493 and to make sure that the pigs were fed,
###496 and they left all of that work for Robert.
###500 He had to earn his every meal.
###504 
###528 We went to the same school.
###530 And he had me teaching me the stuff...
###532 of what takes place in the country... how to ride a donkey, how to ride a horse.
###535 How to do all of this kind of stuff.
###538 And I taught him about music, 'cause...
###540 that was what I was exposed to prior coming to Saint Ann.
###544 
###550  I was accustomed to building bamboo guitars...
###553 and sardine tin guitars.
###555 Cutting the wire... the electric wire...
###558 opening it up, taking out those little fine wires and making our strings.
###565 
###608 In a little district on a little island
###612 Where men and pretty gal run wild
###615 Well there's one old crazy who went much wider
###617 So they call her rider Rough rider
###620 - Outta that, Robert Marley saw...
###625 a way out.
###628 His guitar.
###631 In high seas or in low seas
###636 I'm gonna be your friend
###642 I'm gonna be your friend
###652 I heard her praying praying praying
###659 I said I heard my mother
###662 She was praying in the night
###669 And the words that she said The words that she said
###674 They still lingers in my head Lingers in my head
###679 She said a child is born in this world
###683 He needs protection
###687 Whoa mmm
###690 God guide and protect us
###694 
###701 One good thing about music
###704 When it hits You feel no pain
###707 I say one good thing about music
###711 When it hits You feel no pain
###714 Hit me with music
###716 Hit me with music now
###720 This is Trenchtown rock
###722 Don't what's that
###724  We grew up in Trench Town. We were exposed to everything.
###727 'Cause you have the bad guys there
###729 who eventually turn out to be the con men.
###731 You have the musicians. And you have the sportsmen.
###736 Everybody lived just like a block away from each other.
###740 It's like a melting pot.
###743 - Well, living in Trench Town, you know, um,
###746 as a young man, surviving was easy.
###749 The only thing that you have to really look out for was the police, you know,
###753 'cause the police can just get ya, frame ya.
###756 You go to prison and...
###757 "Look, I come from Trench Town." Trench Town's that...
###760 Find them say, "Where you from?"
###762 You say, "Trench Town." You're gone.
###765 You know what I mean?
###766 - No, it was tough. All of Kingston is like that, you know?
###769 Everybody. A lot of people don't know, but Bob, me,
###772 all of we, went to bed hungry a lot.
###775 I mean real hungry.
###776 I don't mean like, "Oh, he had some, a little piece of this."
###778 Nothing. One of the famous lines was,
###781 "Drink some water and go to bed." You know?
###784 In those days you never have... You might have one pair of shoes.
###787 One suit of clothes. So you walk bare feet all the time.
###790 Bob too, you know? A lot of people don't know that.
###793 That kind of sufferation and struggle...
###796 can make you either go bad or good.
###800 And I guess that's what he did, you know?
###802 He figured the music would get him out,
###804 so he stuck to it and focused, you know?
###811  You know, as an individual they're forced to be creative.
###815 Because that's where your reggae music born, Trench Town.
###818 
###831 Dread natty dread now
###834 Natty dread
###836 Dreadlock Congo bongo I
###840 Natty dread
###841 Natty dreadlock
###844  In Trench Town we have First Street.
###845 All the way up to 13th Street.
###847 First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth,
###848 and so on and so forth.
###850 Him sing about it in "Natty Dread."
###852 Then I walk up the First Street
###856 Natty dread
###858 And then I walk up the Second Street to see
###862 Natty dread
###864 
###876 - He was different, mon. He was different.
###879 He just loved music.
###883 Music and cricket and football.
###886 Natty Congo I
###889 Natty dread
###890 Oh
###894 - One day he just come home and give me the books and say,
###896 "I'm not going back to school."
###898 And, um, him say have a friend that he can give these books to.
###903 And he did that, and then he turned to his music.
###906 I'm a rebel
###910 Soul rebel
###915 I'm a capturer
###917 That's right
###918 Soul adventurer
###921 Yeah mon
###924 I'm a rebel
###928 Soul rebel
###930  Robert keep pounding, keep pounding, keep pounding.
###934 Telling me that this is what it should be and, uh...
###938 And I'm saying, "No, I'm gonna get ready to go to college.
###940 I can't be no music." He say, "No, it's music."
###942  When did you begin to get involved in music?
###945 - Well, I was always interested in music,
###947 but at that time I was learning a trade, you know,
###949 and meet up some guys who can sing.
###952 One named Desmond Dekker.
###955 - Desmond Dekker and Bob used to work as welders...
###961 at the same place.
###962 Desmond Dekker came down, and I auditioned him.
###966 And we recorded his song.
###969  And after he did that song, Robert wanted now to record.
###974 So Desmond take him Beverley's.
###976 And he went away and recorded a song...
###978 to prove to me that if he could record a song, I could.
###984  Don't you look at me so smug now
###988 And say I'm going bad
###992 Who are you to judge me
###996 And the life that I live
###1000 - I noticed his use of words in the songs.
###1003 "Judge Not"... it was a revolutionary song...
###1007 defending his rights as an individual.
###1011 It occurred to me, "Wow, this guy's really a good poet."
###1015 Judge not
###1018 Before you judge yourself
###1021 - After the recording,
###1022 Leslie Kong wanted to change Bob's name,
###1024 because Robert Marley didn't sound so catchy and easy.
###1028 So he wanted to call Bob "Adam."
###1032 Adam Marley.
###1035 Bob wouldn't have it.
###1041  He realizes that a group would be maybe the appropriate thing,
###1045 other than being individual, solo artists.
###1048 We used to listen to groups like Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers,
###1052 The Drifters, The Platters.
###1054 So there was a recruitment process taking place.
###1058 Myself and Robert started to put the group together.
###1063 And then here comes this tall, dark,
###1066 as they would say, handsome dude named Peter,
###1069 and he has this guitar knowledge.
###1071 And from Robert, you hear Robert say, "Play guitar? You serious?"
###1075 So he goes give him the guitar right away.
###1077 So it's four-string steel, but Peter tune the four-string,
###1081 and he's just like that.
###1085  On First Street is a music street.
###1087 We had three or four places on First Street that we rehearse,
###1091 and they were rehearsing like every day.
###1093 At the time, it was Bob, Peter, Bunny.
###1097  We used to call ourselves "Juveniles." "Brothers in the Ghetto."
###1101 Where we used to go to rehearse, they'd say,
###1103 "You come from a wailing environment where people always bawling.
###1107 And, well, you should be named the Wailers."
###1109 This train it is bound to glory
###1113 This train
###1119 This train is bound to glory
###1123 This train
###1129 This train is bound to glory
###1134 This train don't carry
###1136 - As far as the Wailers' harmony, and the building of the Wailers musically,
###1142 Joe Higgs is the responsible person.
###1146 Having his own career,
###1148 he decided to take the group up as a project.
###1182 His policy was that great stars sometimes get messed up...
###1186 when they get afraid, you know, when they get nervous on stage.
###1190 So he said that...
###1191 if we went to the cemetery at, say, 2:00 in the morning...
###1196 and sang for those people,
###1198 then we can't be afraid when we hit the stage.
###1201 And we went with Joe, sat on the graves, played.
###1205 Several times we do it until he thought we were brave enough now.
###1210 
###1216 Gather together Be brothers and sisters
###1220 We're independent We're independent
###1223  Just about the time of the independence,
###1226 the Jamaican musicians wanted to have a music...
###1229 that they can call Jamaican music.
###1231 - Well, Jamaica came up with a unique rhythm.
###1234 I didn't think it was deliberately done.
###1236 I think it was an attempt to play something, and it came out that way.
###1240 It became known as reggae, but it started off as ska,
###1243 which was putting all the accent...
###1245 on a different beat than what is normally where the accent is.
###1249 It would be on the off beat instead of the on beat.
###1251 
###1255  Ska developed out of American music that we were exposed to...
###1259 on top of our Jamaican indigenous music,
###1262 such as mento, calypso, Kumina.
###1267 Simmer down
###1269 You lickin' too hot
###1271 So simmer down Soon you'll get dropped
###1274 - We were at a bar one evening.
###1278 And one of the guys, them says to us, "Listen to this group."
###1281 And they punched the jukebox.
###1284 And the song was called "Simmer Down."
###1288 And no more other tune play on that box...
###1291 the whole time we were there but "Simmer Down," I tell you.
###1294 Oh simmer down Oh control your temper
###1298 Simmer down For the battle will be hotter
###1302 - "Simmer Down" went straight into the number-one position,
###1305 and the Wailers were launched.
###1308 ...that I'm leaving you today Simmer down
###1314 - What was it like working at Studio 1, where you started, in those days?
###1317  Yeah, it was good, you know, 'cause, you know,
###1320 first experience within music.
###1322 Working with some good musician
###1323 and trying to get the harmonies and everything. It was great.
###1326  I heard you actually... you personally lived in the studio.
###1329  Sometime.
###1331  You had Coxsone made you a room out the back.
###1333  Yes.
###1335  Well, Coxsone was, um, a smart guy,
###1339 in that he has an ear for music, good music.
###1341 - He might not have been an instrument player.
###1343 He might not even know if the guitar is tuned,
###1345 but he knows when the sound is right.
###1349 - He has his own program on the radio.
###1351 Has his own record shop.
###1353 Has his own sound system. Has his own studio.
###1356 So he's obviously a leader.
###1357 - Coxsone was like a father to us, you know, to be honest with you.
###1361 Coxsone was like a father to us.
###1362 He cared for us.
###1368 Coxsone gave Robbie a little room round the back of the premises.
###1373 I didn't have anywhere to live neither.
###1375 So Robbie and me lived there. Both of us lived there.
###1378 So we became intimate good friends.
###1380 He gave Robbie a record player and a lot of foreign records.
###1386 Robbie was a fanatic in listening to these people...
###1389 because he was a serious, focused man.
###1392 Even as a youth.
###1394 - Jamaican music developed from what we call "do overs,"
###1400 a version of somebody's song in America.
###1403 Each night I ask the stars up above
###1410 Why must I be a teenager in love
###1416 Put me in your milling machine
###1419 I never thought you could act so mean
###1424 Now I'm wondering what to do
###1428 To see if you could love me too
###1432  Bob had a good sound 'cause he's singing lead.
###1435 And the harmony was tight.
###1436 - The harmony Bunny carried, and Peter was fantastic.
###1441 Why must I be a teenager in love
###1449  Peter and Bunny was the most vocal one to say hi,
###1454 but Bob was very reserved and just look.
###1458 As he would say, just "cotch and look."
###1462 - As much as there was this obvious love and admiration...
###1466 for each other and of each other,
###1468 there was always a deep underlying tension...
###1471 that none would be a "yes man" to the other.
###1475 I think the music was the glue that held them together.
###1480 Feel them spirit
###1483 Feel them spirit
###1487 Feel them spirit
###1491 Lord, I thank you
###1495 Lord, I thank you
###1499 I'm gonna put it on
###1502 I'm gonna put it on
###1513 - By then he was admiring me.
###1519 I got a letter from Bunny, bringing a letter.
###1521 It was him sending his letter through his friend. Not by himself.
###1525 And to say yes, he likes me and want to talk to me.
###1529 I say, "Come over and talk."
###1531 And he would stay on the other side of the road and...
###1534 He was very shy. He was very shy. He was a shy guy.
###1538 I'll play your favorite song darling
###1544 He had a seriousness, and he was one
###1546 that you could say was reaching out for love.
###1557 - I didn't think, I liked brown-skin men.
###1560 I always dream of a guy... tall, black, handsome.
###1565 Every young girl's dream in Jamaica is to have a tall, black boyfriend.
###1570 They would call Bob an outcast...
###1572 because he really don't belong to no... you're in-between.
###1575 You're black and white, so they're... "You're not even black."
###1579  I think he always felt like an outsider...
###1582 because he was a half breed.
###1584 And when Mortimer Planno took him in,
###1587 well, that automatically gave him acceptance.
###1592  Mortimer Planno was a Rasta spiritual leader who taught Bob.
###1597 - He was like a preacher. He preached Rastafarianism,
###1601 and he had a following.
###1603 
###1608  He hooked up with Bob as a young boy.
###1611 I think that they gelled together.
###1614  Bob looked up to him? - Oh, yes.
###1618 
###1645  Rastafarian were the only true Afrocentric black people.
###1651 Who preached self-reliance, who preached self-confidence.
###1655  But we interpret the Bible a different way.
###1658 Most of these places that they're telling you about in the Bible is in Africa.
###1662 The Garden of Eden is in Africa.
###1665 The teaching that we get from the elders then...
###1668 is that we always have to look upon a black man as God.
###1672 For we, somebody that we can identify with.
###1676 
###1696  Emperor Haile Selassie I is the reincarnation of Jesus Christ.
###1701 He's our God. Rasta God.
###1705 Rasta said the purpose of life is to be happy.
###1709 Everybody's supposed to be happy...
###1712 and live in peace, love and unity.
###1714 Yeah, mon.
###1718 I think when him start take it serious now as a Rastaman...
###1721 was when him start growing dreadlocks.
###1724 - Locks meant that you were a Rastafarian and you've taken a vow...
###1729 Nazarite vow not to cut or comb your hair for a certain length of time,
###1732 and it has a significance and is not to be taken lightly.
###1736 - How important are the dreadlocks?
###1738 - This? This is my identity, mon. - Is that part of being a Rasta?
###1742 - Yeah, this is my identity.
###1743 - Then you go through all the various rules...
###1748 for living as set out by the Bible.
###1750 How you eat, how you live, how you treat other people.
###1754 And he believed that, um,
###1755 if you practice these things, well, life will be better.
###1758 Not only for you, but for everyone else.
###1761 Got to have kaya now
###1765 Got to have kaya now
###1770 Got to have kaya now
###1774 For the rain is falling
###1777  Marijuana's illegal in Jamaica,
###1780 but the Rastas say they smoke it because the Bible tells them to.
###1784 The Book of Revelations says to "partake of the herb."
###1789 - The herb was like a sacramental food to us.
###1792 We take it for reasons, not just to get high.
###1796 It put us in a holy, peaceful,
###1799 happy, inspirational mood.
###1802  Were you born as a Rasta?
###1805 When I was born, you know, and growing,
###1808 there was a certain amount of consciousness...
###1812 in the higher self...
###1814 that, you know,
###1817 it was always a lonely world,
###1818 not finding people who might think like me, you know?
###1824 So off I'm going on, and going on
###1825 and I come to Kingston, meet some more people.
###1829 Them people is Rasta.
###1830 It's after that I find out it's the same thing I have inside.
###1835 It's the same thing.
###1836 - How old were you when this started to happen?
###1838 - This is about 17, 18, you know? - Ah.
###1841 - I think in the belief or knowledge...
###1846 of Haile Selassie, Bob found his real father,
###1853 which he'd never really knew.
###1855 - I think he saw himself now.
###1857 This is where he found himself, yes.
###1859 No more about being half white or half black.
###1862 It's just one... one love.
###1865 One love One heart
###1869 Let's join together and I'll feel all right
###1873 One love One heart
###1877 Let's join together and I will feel all right
###1881  Undaunted by the driving rain, a sea of faces awaited...
###1884 at the Palisadoes Airport the arrival of a living legend.
###1887 For some, he was the King of Kings.
###1890 The Lion of Judah...
###1892 even a god.
###1893 Members of a local cult, the Rastafarians,
###1896 who worship this figure as a deity, were present in full force.
###1903 His Imperial Majesty, Haile Selassie I,
###1906 Emperor of Ethiopia, arrived.
###1909  When the plane landed, thousands ran out and surrounded the plane.
###1914 Some of them smoking. Our police were powerless.
###1917 And Selassie came to the door of the plane, I remember,
###1921 and after about 20 minutes and he just looked and went back in.
###1926 It took a long time to get him off the plane.
###1930  So he came off the plane and he greet, and I say...
###1933 I say, "Wait, but this is a little man.
###1935 There is this little man they say is God. Them crazy."
###1939 - I sit there on my bicycle, waiting on him.
###1943 And when him come up, he look right in my face.
###1946 It was like him look into everybody face.
###1950 But he look upon everyone.
###1953 I remember, I see that.
###1955  And he just turn his head around...
###1957 and he was looking straight at me.
###1959 And he did like this.
###1962 And I look and I look,
###1964 and I saw his hand, and I saw a mark in his hand.
###1968 And believe you, my brother, when I saw that I went crazy.
###1973 I run all the way back to Trench Town.
###1976 Take your troubles to Selassie
###1993 He is the only King of Kings
###2001 King of Kings
###2004 King of Kings Selassie
###2011  The deeper Bob got into the faith... the Rastafarian faith...
###2015 the more his music became entwined.
###2021 - He was very into the social commentary side of the music.
###2025 Mr. Dodd didn't like that because it wasn't commercial enough.
###2029 So he was a little frustrated because he couldn't do the music...
###2032 the way he really wanted it to be done.
###2035  And also at that time, money was a problem.
###2039 Coxsone wasn't the kind of person at the time to argue money with,
###2044 unless you were willing to go to war.
###2047  When you go and ask him for your money,
###2049 he usually like to bring off some bad boy style.
###2052 'Cause he has his thugs around him.
###2055 You know what I mean? Enforcer type of guys.
###2058 - It was traditional in those days...
###2061 that artists who recorded never made money...
###2065 because the record company who collected the money...
###2068 never gave the artist any money.
###2069 - Yeah, we got paid like minimum wage.
###2072 Three pounds a week, that's it. Each.
###2075 - You couldn't live off it.
###2077  Could Bob live off it? - Nah, mon.
###2079 That's why Bob had to leave and start doing his own thing.
###2083  So Robert left the group to go to Delaware,
###2087 to the United States.
###2088 To migrate.
###2092 
###2100 Gotta hold on to this feeling we got
###2103 We gonna blow blow blow
###2105 'Cause we love love love you now
###2108 - Yeah, well that was a marriage that I wasn't invited to, nor Peter.
###2113 But because he's our brother we lived with it.
###2119  We got married, like, on the 11th.
###2121 And he left on the 12th of February.
###2125 
###2130 Run for cover
###2133 Run for cover
###2135 Rain is taking over
###2137 
###2138 Taking over
###2141  He came here... his mother wants him here.
###2143 Bob loved his mother.
###2147  He got a job at the du Pont Hotel vacuuming the floor.
###2151 Then he got a job at Chrysler.
###2153 - When he was working there, he used to...
###2156 I think he used to drive one of the forklift.
###2160 I think he have a song out of that driving the forklift all night.
###2164 I'm working all night
###2167 Got to be all right
###2170 See I work for my bread
###2173 All right
###2175 Night and day All night
###2177 Work for my pay
###2178 All right Night and day
###2182 No no no no no no
###2187 No no no no no no
###2191 Can you feel it No no no no no no
###2194 - Well, he was just very humble, very loving,
###2197 and he was very quiet, really.
###2200  Was he smoking a lot of ganja then?
###2202 - Yeah, he was growing it too, man, in his backyard,
###2205 and he had a row of herb plants,
###2209 I mean towering in the air, and I couldn't believe it.
###2212 'Cause at that time in Wilmington, Delaware,
###2214 man, they were kicking people's doors in for a little joint.
###2218 - I used to go up to his house and we'd go in the basement.
###2220 He'd play his guitar, and I would play my congas. I played congas.
###2223 And we would just jam.
###2224 And I didn't really realize he was such a great musician.
###2229  But he never gave up music,
###2231 'cause his mummy, she would write me to say,
###2234 "All Nesta does is stay in the basement...
###2237 and play his guitar."
###2239  Well, I couldn't stand it. I wasn't doing what I wanted to do.
###2244 So I went back to Jamaica, where I must get more freedom.
###2248 Bend down low
###2252 Let me tell you what I know yeah
###2257 Bend down low
###2262  When Robbie came back from the U.S.,
###2265 we decided to start our own independent label, "Wail'n Soul'm."
###2270 So we went in and did "Bend Down Low."
###2274 "Bend Down Low" was a number one.
###2277 We started to build our own economy.
###2280 We used to ride with our bicycles and distribute the records to jukeboxes,
###2284 sound systems, record stores, with our bicycles.
###2288 - The Wailers' music dominated the dance halls.
###2290 But it was hardly played on our Jamaican radio stations.
###2297  In the music business, they were just prejudiced.
###2299 The first problem is being a Rasta.
###2302 And the next problem is that you're not with the big companies.
###2305 So that's a... that's a heavy load to carry.
###2307  These disc jockeys, when they went on air,
###2311 they had their own program sometime.
###2312 They had their own sorts of records from these...
###2315 these different companies that they would have to play.
###2318 Sometimes we were not included. So to be included in that,
###2322 we had to get real tough sometimes.
###2324 - I used to drive Bob with "Skill" Cole...
###2327 - Yeah.
###2328 - And Frowser and Tek-Life.
###2330 Do you remember them, these two little gangsters?
###2332 - Yeah. Right.
###2334 Yeah.
###2336 - I used to drive to the radio station, right? - Right.
###2339 - And they'd leave me in the car. Right?
###2342 And they'd go in. Skill Cole had a baseball bat.
###2344 You know they don't play baseball in Jamaica.
###2346 I don't know where he got a baseball bat.
###2348 And Skill Cole was big... A big guy. - Yeah.
###2350 - Right? They'd go in the radio station.
###2352 They'd have me listen to the radio...
###2356 to make sure that they're really
###2359 playing the record. - Right.
###2363 And then Coxsone, Studio 1,
###2366 Dualcreed, Trojan and Prince Buster...
###2370 decide to form an organization called "The Big Tree."
###2375 Then the Wailers pulled the ax.
###2378 If you are a big tree
###2382 We are the small ax
###2386 Sharpened to cut you down
###2389 Well sharp
###2391 To cut you down
###2424  Lee Perry used to work with Coxsone.
###2428 So when he started doing his independent business,
###2432 we admired him, because he follow our footstep out of Coxsone.
###2441  My experience of "Scratch" is that,
###2443 number one, he's a very innovative producer.
###2446 Very creative.
###2448 I mean, to the point that it became an excitement...
###2451 to see him come into the studio with a half flask of white rum...
###2455 and sprinkle the four corners of the studio with it.
###2458 Flash.
###2460 And then he would go into his little...
###2462 You know, he would, like, dance.
###2465 He didn't write music scores. He would say, you know,
###2468 "Snap, I want you to play this," you know?
###2469 And he would just hop through the music, you know?
###2472 And they... they would follow him.
###2475 I would believe that his early recordings with the Wailers
###2478 were the best to my knowledge.
###2480 Perry had a lot of influence on Bob's, uh, career.
###2492 These are the words of my master
###2499 
###2510  Why do people like his music so much though?
###2512 
###2557 - It is mentioned often in the Bible...
###2558 that there shall be a music that all people of all global concerns...
###2563 shall play and dance and sing this music.
###2565 It's in the Revelation.
###2567 What other music could that be?
###2570 Reggae.
###2573 - What really changed it to reggae...
###2577 was the riff actually with the guitar.
###2580 It just basically a rhythm change...
###2582 in terms of what the guitar...
###2584 the guitar used to play like cha, cha, cha.
###2587 And then it start playing chaka, chaka, chaka, chaka.
###2600 Yes my friend
###2605 We're in the streets again
###2610 Sometimes some of these things happen out of just maybe an accident.
###2613 Somebody was doing something and the producer went, "Hey, I like that."
###2617 Can set me free again
###2620  Coxsone had bought a piece of equipment from the United States.
###2625 And it was in the studio for a long time and no one knew what to do with it.
###2628 They decided to hook it up.
###2630 And when it was hooked up, they realized it was a tape delay.
###2633 So when you make one strum,
###2635 it comes back at you at the same time. "Chicka."
###2638 And the other studios heard "Chicka"...
###2642 and thought it was a guitar making more sounds.
###2644 So reggae, to my mind, actually developed out of an illusion.
###2650 So if you a bullbucka
###2653 Let me tell you this
###2655 I'm a duppy conqueror
###2660 Conqueror
###2662  The beats are bam, bam, bam, bam.
###2664 With reggae you got three beats out of four beats,
###2667 and you imagine the next beat.
###2669 Feel the next beat. That's reggae.
###2671 Feel. Heartbeat. Feel.
###2673 
###2677 
###2683 Yeah.
###2685 Heartbeats.
###2688 Real deal.
###2690 - The basic parts of the music were the drum and the bass.
###2696 Because, you know, drums are the first instruments in music.
###2705 So the drum is the heartbeat,
###2707 and the bass, it is the backbone.
###2710  Well, I think the drum and bass...
###2713 play a very important part in Bob's music.
###2715 It was, you know, "Family Man" and Carlton... two brothers.
###2718 They have their own style.
###2720 Stir it up
###2724 Little darlin'
###2727 Stir it up
###2729 Come on baby
###2731  Reggae is a concept of all different type of music.
###2736 You got funk. You got rhythm and blues.
###2740 You got soul.
###2742 And then very jazzy when it's ready.
###2746 It's been a long long time
###2750 Since I've got you on my mind
###2755 Whoa whoa whoo yeah
###2758 And now you are here
###2761 I say it's so clear
###2765 To see what we could do baby
###2769 Just me and you
###2770 Come on and stir it up
###2775 Little darlin' Stir it up
###2780 Come on baby
###2784 Come on and stir it up
###2788 Little darlin' Stir it up
###2797 - I was working with a company called National Dry Cleaners.
###2800 And I was in charge of a branch.
###2803 And Rita came in one day with some clothes to,
###2806 you know, to be dry-cleaned.
###2808 She gave out the clothes and she said, "Rita Marley."
###2811 So I was quite surprised,
###2814 because, I mean, the only Marley I know was the white Marleys.
###2817 I call them the white Marleys.
###2819 And, uh, so I said, "Who is Marley?"
###2822 She said, "Well, that's my husband."
###2825 And I said, "Who is his father?"
###2826 She said she don't know much about him, but she know they call him Captain Marley.
###2830 And then I said, "That's my father."
###2835 My mother used to work in a boardinghouse,
###2838 and my dad would stay there when he comes from...
###2840 from sea or wherever he goes, and that's how she met him.
###2845  And did they have a long relationship or was it very brief?
###2848 - I think it was very brief.
###2851 My mother didn't really know what happened to him.
###2857  In Jamaica, used to have a big company.
###2860 Established company named Marley and Plant.
###2863 They did construction, Marley and Plant.
###2865 Most of the construction jobs in and around the country.
###2869 That was the company who did it.
###2872 And he always said those were his family.
###2874 - Yeah, I remember one time, I think,
###2877 him go to them to try borrow some money to buy a car,
###2880 you know, so they can deliver the records.
###2884 And the story goes, when he walked in the office,
###2887 like the whole staff turned around 'cause he looked so much like them.
###2890 
###2893 - They told us to go away.
###2895 They know nothing about Norval having a baby.
###2899 - Knowing my father, as I do, um,
###2902 I don't know how strong the word rejected is.
###2905 But he might have been rejected, for sure,
###2909 because, um, a different era and my father was a disciplinarian,
###2914 and he was quite a stern man in his own way.
###2917 In those days Rastafarians weren't as socially accepted as they are now.
###2924 - He said to me, "When all this happened, it gave me more strength...
###2928 because I went to write a song."
###2930 You know, write a song. I said "What song?"
###2932 He said, "Try to pick it up." He said, "The stone the builder refuse.
###2935 I'm the stone. I'm the one."
###2937  I just wanted to play you a song... which we were told, Bob,
###2942 after he went to see your father and he felt rejected,
###2945 he wrote this song about that experience.
###2948 I'm just very curious to know what you think of it.
###2950 - Oh, really? I'd be interested. I'd be interested to hear it.
###2954 
###2966 The stone that the builder refused
###2970 Will always be the head cornerstone
###2973 Sing it brother
###2984 - Nice song.
###2986 You're a builder baby
###2990 Here I am a stone
###2995 Don't you pick and refuse me
###2999 'Cause the things people refuse
###3001 Are the things they should use
###3004 Do you hear me
###3006 Hear what I say
###3009 - I've heard this song before, but I never placed any significance in it.
###3014 But I can see where what you're saying could be so.
###3018 Mm-hmm.
###3021 - Am I allowed to talk? - Mm-hmm.
###3024 - Yeah, how true that is.
###3027 'Cause Bob put the Marley name in the world, you know?
###3032 He filled the world with the Marleys by all his music and his children's.
###3038 And he now becomes the Marley.
###3042 You know what I mean? He now becomes the Marley,
###3045 and nobody knows what happened to the rest that used to be so...
###3051 adored and wonderful.
###3053 They're in the background now, and he's in the forefront.
###3056 Isn't that amazing? Yes. Yes. Truly.
###3062 The stone that the builder refused
###3066 Will always be the head cornerstone
###3072 - I think what happened to him... that rejection...
###3074 that is why he was able to reach the world.
###3078 And I think there are so many people out there that are hurting.
###3081 So many people out there that have felt what I have been through,
###3084 and I have a message that can bring change and transformation.
###3101 No woman no cry
###3105 No woman no cry
###3110 No woman no cry
###3115 No woman no cry
###3119 'Cause 'cause
###3121 'Cause I remember when we used to sit
###3125 In the government yard in Trench Town
###3130 Oba observing the hypocrites yeah
###3135 Mingle with the good people we meet yeah
###3140 Good friends we have Oh good friends we've lost
###3145 Along the way yeah
###3149 In this great future you can't forget your past
###3154 So dry your tears I say
###3158 Yeah
###3159 Everything's gonna be all right
###3162 Everything's gonna be all right
###3164 Everything's gonna be all right
###3167 Everything's gonna be all right
###3169 Everything's gonna be all right
###3171 Everything's gonna be all right
###3174 Everything's gonna be all right
###3177 Everything's gonna be all right
###3179 Everything's gonna be all right
###3181 Everything's gonna be all right
###3184 Everything's gonna be all right
###3186 Everything's gonna be all right
###3189 Everything's gonna be all right
###3195 
###3197 
###3201  Somebody rang me and said, "Oh, by the way,
###3203 Bob Marley and the Wailers are in London. Would you like to meet them?"
###3207 I was intrigued to meet them because, you know,
###3209 you'd heard a lot about them by now.
###3215 When they came in the office, they were just really impressive.
###3219 Very charismatic.
###3222 I just said to go make an album and asked them how much they thought.
###3226 They told me, and I gave them the money to do that.
###3231 We took 4,000 pounds and did the Catch a Fire album.
###3236  I was trying to get across that this is a black rock act.
###3239 That's how I wanted it to be perceived.
###3241 Get up stand up
###3243 Stand up for your rights
###3246 Get up stand up
###3249 Stand up for your rights
###3252 Get up stand up
###3254 And don't give up the fight
###3262 My sense is that Bob was ready to give it a try,
###3266 and that the others weren't that keen.
###3271  The frame of mind that Bob was in, he didn't mind it.
###3274 He said, "I had to start somewhere."
###3277 He always said it.
###3278 "If you don't start somewhere, you're not gonna get nowhere."
###3280 Get up stand up
###3283 Stand up for your rights
###3286 Get up stand up
###3290  Bob wanted it to reach not just the Jamaicans...
###3292 Bob wanted it to reach the American market.
###3295 He wanted it to reach the European market.
###3298 And in order to do that, you had to flavor it that way.
###3301 Stand up for your rights
###3304 Get up stand up
###3307 And don't give up the fight
###3315 Ital.
###3317 Irie.
###3321  The first record is easily the most,
###3323 for want of a better word, pasteurized.
###3326 I added sort of different things into it.
###3329 - All those guitars and the keyboards are all overdubs.
###3342 No sun will shine in my day today
###3349 No sun will shine
###3352 The high yellow moon won't come out to play
###3357 Won't come out to play
###3361 I said darkness has covered my light
###3368 And has changed my day into night yeah
###3373 Where is the love to be found
###3379 Won't someone tell me
###3381  I had no doubt that it would succeed.
###3384 I had no doubt.
###3386 The only thing that could stop it succeeding...
###3388 is if I couldn't get them to tour.
###3390 That was my only fear.
###3392 Concrete jungle
###3394 I say where the living is hardest
###3398  They went on this famous tour,
###3399 and things went wrong.
###3401 Things went sour.
###3403 - We did a tour of England of the Catch a Fire album,
###3407 but no one told us that it was a promotional tour,
###3411 so we wouldn't be getting any money.
###3414  You're top group in Jamaica now,
###3416 and you probably think that going to England is going to be the same.
###3420 Bob was more real.
###3422 'Cause he said to me, "Eh, nobody know the Wailers."
###3425 - I think Bob recognized he needed to get out there and do it,
###3428 and I think the others were not sure.
###3430 It's like grassroots, you know?
###3433 You're on a bus all night, schlepping up and down the motorway,
###3436 eating terrible food.
###3438 You know, it's rough.
###3440 In the case of Bunny, I think he just didn't want to be in the cold and the snow.
###3445 He just... it just wasn't worth it to him.
###3451  Bob wanted success.
###3454 Bunny and Peter were more militant.
###3456 People wanted to separate them...
###3459 because they didn't want to deal with Bunny and Peter.
###3463 - When you say people, do you mean Island Records?
###3466 - Of course.
###3467 - The American leg was next.
###3470 So I said, "Are we going to get some money out of this leg?"
###3473 Chris Blackwell said, no, because you're gonna be doing freak clubs.
###3478 You know, a place where all kinds of immoral, mix-up things.
###3483 I say, "Chris you know that we are Rastas.
###3487 Why are you exposing us to them kind of situations there?"
###3490 "Well, if the Wailers don't do those clubs, they're nobody."
###3494 So I said, "Yeah? So I'm not going on this tour.
###3498 This leg, I'm coming off."
###3501 And my brothers, I thought, would have done the same...
###3503 as the conversation affected them both.
###3506 But I was left to look as if I was the only cold front.
###3511 So I hold my position anyway, and still holds my position.
###3518 
###3529 Stop that train I'm leaving
###3535 Stop that train I'm leaving
###3542  Peter was a militant type of guy.
###3544 And I think he didn't like Chris Blackwell too much.
###3547 He figured Chris Blackwell was ripping them off.
###3552 - Well, the time came about '74...
###3555 when we did two L.P.'s with Chris "Whitewell."
###3558 And the way he intend to handle us...
###3561 was like we were unprofessional, or we were just beginners,
###3565 which I did not appreciate.
###3567 But after 12 years of being a background vocalist with the Wailers,
###3571 I didn't get much access of saying,
###3574 or materializing what was in me.
###3576 And that was totally depreciating my ability.
###3579 So I left because I need recognition
###3582 and respect.
###3602  For us as his children he wasn't like a lovey-dovey daddy.
###3606 Uh, you know, a daddy who would, you know...
###3609 "Oh, be careful, Son."
###3613 Him was a rough man.
###3615 Him was rough, you know? Rough, rough, rough.
###3619 
###3628  We were always active. You know, like, we're on the beach.
###3630 We're running. We're racing each other.
###3633 It was always about racing to see who could beat him.
###3637  I mean, there was no let-up in him.
###3639 There was no, like, "It's children. Let me run slow."
###3642 
###3645 The fastest he could run against us he would.
###3649 - And then he would find it hilarious, and we didn't find it so funny.
###3654 Yeah, nobody wanted their children around...
###3657 ...us.
###3661 "Nasty. Drug heads.
###3664 All your parents do is smoke weed and play music.
###3668 And therefore my kid cannot play with you."
###3672 So it wasn't a positive thing.
###3675 I would have friends who, like, basically if they want to sleep over,
###3678 they would have to tell their parents they were sleeping somewhere else.
###3681 He said, "You don't need friends.
###3684 You have your brothers and your sisters.
###3686 And that's all you need.
###3689 Don't ever think you'd need friends."
###3694 - I feel Bob worked through so many different experiences in life...
###3697 that I don't think him trust people so easy.
###3701 So it's like, "Who really love me?"
###3707 Play I some music
###3710 Reggae music
###3714 Play I some music Dis a reggae music
###3721 Roots rock reggae
###3723 Dis a reggae music
###3727 Roots rock reggae
###3731 Dis a reggae music
###3733 - Well, the harmony didn't change because then Bob took hold of The I-Threes.
###3738 Because he still wanted to maintain that sound.
###3742 I can't refuse it
###3745 - And Bob invited us to do the Natty Dread tour.
###3749 Feel like dancing
###3752 - From the very first show it was just...
###3754 
###3756 dynamite.
###3758 I
###3764 Rebel music
###3765 - We sold out everything. We're just doing clubs.
###3769 But like the Paul's Mall in Boston...
###3772 we did like something like six nights straight.
###3775 Rebel music
###3782 It's that experience in a 400-seater, 500-seater at the Roxy.
###3787 The Quiet Knight in Chicago, another 500.
###3791 That was the time to see Bob Marley,
###3793 'cause you were as close to him as I am to you now.
###3798  All the way from Trench Town, Jamaica,
###3800 Bob Marley and the Wailers.
###3802 Come on!
###3809  This concert they did in London in 1975... the Lyceum...
###3813 that was the tipping point.
###3815 After that, everybody knew his name.
###3818 There was that sense that he's about to be massive.
###3828 Firstly, it was packed. Over packed.
###3834 When you're at a concert and you've managed to get in,
###3837 and there are X hundred people outside who can't get in,
###3839 you already feel great.
###3841 And that energy you have
###3843 spreads to the band when they come on stage.
###3845 And so they feel something. And it was one of those things.
###3848 It was just... just explosive.
###3851 - When he walked on stage and he felt the crowd moving the theater,
###3855 it was like, "Yes." You know, finally.
###3858 No woman no cry
###3864 No woman no cry
###3871 No woman no cry
###3877 No woman no cry
###3881 Said said
###3883 Said I remember when we used to sit
###3889 In the government yard in Trench Town
###3895 Oba observing the hypocrites
###3900 - This was owned by Chris Blackwell.
###3903 It was called Island House.
###3904 And he had several of his friends and associates who really lived here.
###3908 Not like an apartment building, but people who knew each other.
###3911 You know, they're occupied downstairs and upstairs.
###3915 Chris made this available for Bob to rehearse.
###3919 And eventually, over time,
###3921 Bob bought it from Chris.
###3923 - Well, Rastas weren't allowed uptown,
###3926 and, until Bob moved in, there were no dreadlocks there.
###3931 - A woman said to Bob,
###3933 "How come you live at 56 Hope Road,
###3935 which is two doors up from King's House where the governor lives,
###3940 and three doors up from Jamaica House where the prime minister lives?"
###3944 And Bob just said, "Sister, I bring the ghetto uptown."
###3954 One of the people who live here prior to Bob was Cindy Breakspeare.
###3959 And she lived there with her brother Reds.
###3963 - I loved the accommodation because I loved the old house with the wooden floors,
###3967 and, you know, it was just lovely.
###3970 Cool and breezy, and it was great.
###3978 There's always a stream of people up and down,
###3981 and shouting and laughter and just general carrying on.
###3986 You were right in the mix.
###3988 The most important thing culturally that was happening in Jamaica at that time...
###3992 was happening right there.
###3995 That was the headquarters. That was the center of it all.
###3998 Bob never left 56 Hope Road.
###4001 People come from all over the world to see him.
###4005  Did you live at Hope Road with your dad?
###4008 No, we lived probably a couple of miles from Hope Road.
###4010 - Right. - 'Cause Hope Road was really...
###4015 I don't know. It was a spot.
###4018  Rasta is an open-door thing.
###4020 Nobody not checking your credentials.
###4023 So all kinds of people come in to Hope Road.
###4025 Good, bad and indifferent.
###4028  Every time you go to 56 Hope Road,
###4031 you would see a lot of people gather with Bob... reasoning,
###4034 talking about politics,
###4036 talking about God,
###4038 talking about history.
###4040 You know, talking about everything.
###4043 - Bob was very strict. Him run this thing like an army.
###4047 We call him "Skipper."
###4049 You see, the thing is, we had certain strict rules at that time.
###4053 Woman supposed to wear dress, not pants.
###4057 So you had those kind...
###4058 Don't come in with what we call war paint.
###4061 Lipstick and eye shadow. And this is a roots saying kinda,
###4065 if you wanna come round Rasta,
###4066 then you have to throw away those Babylonian things.
###4070  It was a camp with rules and doctrines...
###4073 and tenets to live by, and it was serious.
###4078  Bob was very, like, health conscious with him foods.
###4082  The blender would always be going with excellent juices.
###4086 Irish moss on the fire. Fish tea going.
###4089 You know, everything to make you strong.
###4097 - When I met him, we started a routine.
###4099 My routine was getting up in the mornings, training,
###4103 do a lot of running, exercise, go to the beach.
###4105 So it became an integral part of our lifestyle.
###4108 - The whole Rasta thing is based on eternal life
###4111 and taking care of your body.
###4113 It's the temple of the Lord.
###4116 And we'd run on the beach and then up this mountain
###4118 to a place called Cane River Falls. Incredible waterfalls.
###4121 I shot some video up there.
###4123 'Cause every day we pay the price with a little sacrifice
###4128 Jammin' till the jam is through
###4132 We're jammin'
###4135  Cane River, we went up there, really,
###4138 to get the waterfall beat on your back.
###4141 It was like the best massage you can get.
###4147 This spot we're standing on now was a stadium.
###4151 This was a football field.
###4158 So we had like two goal posts.
###4160 You know, like small scrimmage.
###4162 The most we ever played was five-a-side scrimmage.
###4165 So you had one there.
###4166 Then we had one down the back here.
###4168 So, I'd say maybe...
###4170 "Wow, that's a small field when you look at it."
###4173 Probably was what, 40 yards?
###4177 In everything that Bob does, very competitive.
###4182 So, you know, everything he really gave it 110%.
###4193 - He had a passion.
###4194 Everything I did with a ball, he would try to do it.
###4200  He just didn't play for the fun of it.
###4202 This was always part of the process, you know?
###4204 Before he writes a song he'd burn a spliff.
###4207 Then you go run, so you can lively up yourself.
###4211 And then you get more inspired so the lyrics can come out.
###4218  I play everywhere.
###4221 Anywhere it is possible, you know?
###4223 
###4235  He began to come and visit.
###4238 You just hear these footsteps come running up the steps in the evening,
###4241 always when the football was over and place kind of quiet down, you know?
###4245 And there's nobody to really see the little moves that you're making.
###4248 'Cause in the day the place is teeming with people,
###4250 so you can't be too overt because you'd be outed instantly.
###4256 
###4258 
###4275 
###4279 I went downtown I went downtown
###4282 I saw Miss Brown Said I saw Miss Brown
###4286 She had brown sugar Had brown sugar
###4289 All over her booga-wooga Over her booga-wooga
###4293 Think I might join the fun Think I might join the fun
###4296 But I had to hit and run But I had to hit and run
###4299 See I just can't settle down
###4303 In a kinky part of town
###4305 Ride on
###4307  When did you first meet Bob?
###4308 - I see Bob every day.
###4309 Bob live on Second Street. I live on First Street.
###4312 Ride on See I just won't settle down
###4315 Ride on Everybody
###4317 I would take no notice of him...
###4320 because he would bother me, and I would go and tell my mother.
###4324  How old were you? - Sixteen.
###4326 Take me away
###4328 Kinky reggae now
###4330  What did he do when he paid you attention?
###4333  Like stuff like, "Don't give it away. I'm growing you."
###4337 "Remember, don't have any boyfriend before me."
###4338 Stuff like that.
###4341  Was he charming? - Oh, yes.
###4347 
###4350 - Why were so many girls attracted to him?
###4352 - Oh, my God.
###4355 You don't know Bob.
###4358 That's a handsome guy.
###4359 I went down to Piccadilly Circus
###4363 - People have visions of women beating down the door to get at Bob Marley.
###4368 - Je... - Grabbing clothes.
###4371 - Is it like that? - No.
###4374  Why was he so successful with women?
###4377 - Because he was shy.
###4380 Bob is not the womanizer...
###4382 that people make him out to be.
###4385 I think more, the women came at him.
###4388 That why they say Nice one
###4391 Was he faithful?  To whom? God?
###4393 To Jah? Yes, he was faithful to Jah.
###4395 Faithful to any one woman? No.
###4398 Why? Somebody own him?
###4402 What is fidelity? Western ideology, you know.
###4405 A ring on your finger, a ring through your nose?
###4407 That's for Western men, man.
###4410 They can only handle one woman at a time.
###4412 Bob could handle more.
###4418  One day a lady came to me and she said,
###4421 "Didn't anyone tell you that Bob was married?"
###4424 And I didn't know.
###4426 - For a time there I never knew that he was legally married.
###4429 I did come to know. Eventually, his mom told me.
###4433  Did he see Rita at all at that time?
###4435 - Sure. I mean, they worked together, you know.
###4437 Toured the world together.
###4440 - When we were on tour, Rita had her own room.
###4444 She was not with Bob.
###4447 She would see everything that goes on.
###4448 But she had maximum respect for the work.
###4456 - How did you cope through all the years
###4457 that you were married together,
###4459 and Bob was having these relationships with other women?
###4462 - I became his... his guardian angel.
###4465 And then by that time,
###4468 I was past the surface of being just a wife.
###4472 Because of the importance of who I knew Bob is.
###4477 I didn't see it as a fun trip. We were on a mission.
###4480 It was like an evangelist campaign...
###4483 to bring people closer to Jah.
###4487  They had this... this bond, you know?
###4491 I wouldn't... I mean, you know,
###4494 if that was my husband, I wouldn't.
###4499  We never fought about women. We would never get into that.
###4503 He would come and say to me,
###4505 "Rita, I did this," or "This is what happened."
###4508 I was the one that he would call to get women out of his dressing room...
###4512 when it get to that stage.
###4514 "Come up for my room. Come and get these people out for me."
###4517 And I would do that gracefully.
###4520 "Come on, ladies. It's bedtime.
###4521 We have a show tomorrow, so..."
###4524 - She wouldn't get upset, you know,
###4527 but...
###4530 there were times when, you know,
###4532 you knew she was hurting.
###4535 Hurt all of us.
###4538 And that's what he didn't like.
###4540 He didn't like it when, like, we knew that she was hurt,
###4543 and it showed on us.
###4546 That's when, "Okay, we're going for ice cream.
###4548 We're going for burgers. What do you want?"
###4550  Do you think that he was being selfish?
###4553 - Yes. It's not fair to no woman.
###4557 That is not fair at all,
###4559 but we still couldn't hate him for it.
###4563 
###4568 
###4580  In the capital of Kingston there are rival shantytown ghettos...
###4584 where whole communities are divided along sectarian lines.
###4588 These zones are controlled
###4589 by the prime minister's People's National Party,
###4592 who are accused of being communists,
###4594 or by the opposition Jamaica Labour Party,
###4596 who are accused of being fascists.
###4600 - Politics in Jamaica at that time...
###4603 was like an East-West confrontation, which was scary.
###4607 You have one side which is kind of more ultra-conservative, right wing,
###4613 which is Seaga,
###4615 who was like Reagan's man in the Caribbean.
###4617 And then Manley was trying to work a system...
###4621 called democratic socialism,
###4624 which other parties say,
###4625 "That's just a disguise for saying you are a communist."
###4629  Sometimes it's only insults or stones and bottles...
###4632 thrown from one side to the other.
###4633 But often it's bombs and bullets,
###4636 and almost every day the newspapers carry fresh reports...
###4639 of the previous day's killings in Kingston.
###4641  The whole thing became like a gangster thing.
###4645 Political gangster.
###4648 - These were the guys who kept things in line
###4650 for the M.P.s, you know.
###4653 So you find that in some areas, the real power is enforcers.
###4659 - You like this girl... that's both of us.
###4661 You like her, and I like her. We start to fight over her.
###4664 It's like that. He like P.N.P. You like J.L.P.
###4669 You wanna fight for your P.N.P.
###4672 - Bob was friends with all of those guys.
###4675 All of the bad guys from the Labour Party was Bob friend.
###4679 Likewise, all the bad guys from the P.N.P.
###4683  These are guys that come from...
###4685 the same neighborhood he grew up with.
###4687 These are really bad guys.
###4690 'Cause you might see some guys, yeah,
###4692 and then tomorrow you'd take up the Jamaican paper,
###4696 you'd see the 10-most-wanted list...
###4697 four of the guys that were on it are already dead.
###4700 There are now five.
###4703 Some of them actually love the music, you know,
###4706 but their main thing is, you know...
###4708 warfare and badness, you know.
###4712 
###4728 - Bob did a concert with Stevie Wonder in Jamaica,
###4734 and they actually performed two songs together.
###4738 I think very "Superstitious," which Bob knew,
###4741 and "I Shot the Sheriff."
###4745 I shot the sheriff
###4749 But I did not shoot the deputy
###4755  Stevie made a gesture by giving, I think,
###4758 half of his pay for the show...
###4760 to the Salvation Army blind school in Jamaica,
###4763 and I think Bob was moved by that.
###4767 And Bob said, "Well, we'll give a free concert."
###4771 They took that idea
###4774 to Michael Manley,
###4775 who was just down the road... the prime minister...
###4778 and they were, like, enthused about it.
###4781  Bob Marley, the world's leading exponent of reggae music,
###4785 has agreed to appear in a major free concert to be held for the benefit...
###4789 of the Jamaican people in Kingston on Sunday, December 5.
###4792 The announcement was made at a press conference held at Jamaica House...
###4795 by Marley, his manager Don Taylor...
###4798 and the parliamentary secretary in charge of cultural information,
###4800 Arnold Bertram.
###4802  Well, I think he got tricked into it,
###4804 'cause he rang me and asked me if I thought he should do the concert.
###4807 I said, "Well, if it's the prime minister, then you're doing it for the country.
###4812 But if there's going to be an election soon,
###4814 then you're doing it for him rather than the country."
###4817  Two weeks following that announcement on November 22,
###4821 Jamaica's prime minister, Michael Manley,
###4823 called new general elections for December 15.
###4826 - If we knew that election was going to happen in that space of time,
###4830 we'd have never done that concert.
###4833 
###4839  So with the upcoming election,
###4841 you don't really want to think about or care who wins?
###4844 
###4849 - Remember, Bob is becoming very popular,
###4852 and whoever side Bob seems to be on,
###4855 that's the side people gonna be on.
###4857 - Hell, Bob had a lot of control
###4859 down there in Jamaica, man, you know?
###4861 And them politicians didn't like that.
###4863 - Bob, I think, had overexposed himself on the political side,
###4868 and that was bound to draw the anger of some others...
###4872 because he had friends on both sides.
###4873 - The thing was, like, you have to be on one side.
###4876 You have to be on some side.
###4878 You can't be in the middle, or you can get hurt.
###4886  We'd feel a little kind of tension,
###4889 but, you know, the politics kind of getting hot.
###4893  There were people saying that they heard...
###4896 that they were gonna shoot up the concert.
###4899  People in the group, you know, the musicians and The I-Threes...
###4904 every day, as it would get closer to this day of the concert...
###4909 ...people was feeling hesitant about doing it.
###4912 They had a fear for it.
###4918  Every night there would be rehearsal at 56 Hope Road...
###4921 for the concert.
###4925  We usually had two guys...
###4928 from equivalent to the Secret Service.
###4930 They call them the Protective Service.
###4932 They, like, protect the prime minister and stuff.
###4935 And they used to come every night, but they never came that night.
###4941 - We had took a break, so everybody was kind of floating around.
###4945 Don Taylor, Bob and myself...
###4949 was in the kitchen.
###4952 - I was in the car, you know, getting ready to come out.
###4956 I see some men going up the steps.
###4959 - The gunman approached from the side here...
###4964 and kind of pushed his gun through here.
###4967 - Well, you see a black glove with a gun in it pointing up,
###4970 you know... there was nowhere else to go in the kitchen...
###4974 'cause we just, like, at the wall.
###4977 - And then I heard the gunshots.
###4982 
###4988 - Then they turned the gun on the car.
###4991 I felt the warmest of blood running down,
###4994 and then I realized I was shot.
###4997 - The cat just kept on shooting, man, till he ran out of bullets.
###5000 - The one hold a gun to my head,
###5002 and one said to the other one, "Everybody dead?"
###5004 And the other said, "Yeah, man, everybody dead. Everybody dead."
###5007 - Next thing I see Don Taylor come out, man,
###5010 and, like, blood pouring out of him like ketchup, man.
###5013 And then he finally collapsed right there on the floor.
###5015 I'm, like, "Man!"
###5017 - And I'm shouting out for Bob, and then I heard a voice...
###5020 who I recognized as Carly Barrett... coming from.
###5023 He said, "Bob is all right.
###5026 Bob is all right."
###5029 He had a burn right...
###5032 the bullet traveled right here...
###5035 and actually lodged in his arm.
###5039 - It's just a miracle, man, that nobody died from that, man.
###5043  So, it wasn't really a professional hit?
###5045 - Well, as professional as Jamaica is.
###5047 They watch a lot of movies.
###5050 
###5053  Here now is a special item of news.
###5055 Entertainer and reggae star, Bob Marley,
###5058 Rita Marley and the manager of The Wailers, Don Taylor,
###5062 are now patients in the University Hospital
###5064 after receiving gunshot wounds...
###5066 during a shooting incident tonight.
###5075 
###5089 - That's one thing for sure...
###5091 that they was trying to stop that concert from happening.
###5094 - The whole thing about whether the concert was gonna happen or not,
###5097 there was so much pressure, there was pressure from everywhere.
###5100 - I was just scared Bob would get assassinated.
###5107  In the twilight inside the arena,
###5109 the crowd is fenced off...
###5111 and armed police are positioned all around the park.
###5114 Five hours after the concert was due to begin,
###5116 the star, Bob Marley, is still not there.
###5120  Some were trying to say, "Bob, don't go.
###5123 They didn't get you. They may try for you again."
###5126 - Everyone saying, "You really wanna do it, boss?"
###5130 And he was saying... he said, "Yes."
###5132 - I said, "Hey, you know, I'm with you, man.
###5134 If you wanna do it, let's do it."
###5136  The police came for him and took him down,
###5139 and we were in the car right behind the police vehicle.
###5142 
###5148 - When I got there, I couldn't believe the situation, man.
###5153 This is at night in Kingston.
###5156 You got, like, 80,000 people, man. You know what I mean?
###5159 If somebody wanted to try to get you, here's, like, a perfect situation.
###5163 
###5171 But it was a special night, man. It was a special moment, man.
###5174  Come on, people! We got a band to see play tonight.
###5180 Come on!
###5182 
###5185 - Whoo!
###5191  Yeah.
###5194 
###5196  Bob was not afraid.
###5198 Bob knew that if anything happens while he's doing his work,
###5203 he know that the almighty God is protect him.
###5207 Oh children
###5209 In Jamaica
###5212 In Jamaica yow
###5216 - If you lacked faith before then,
###5220 you could not deny it after that, man.
###5223 Almighty
###5225 Almighty
###5227 Oh, Lord, help us Tonight
###5231 Cast away evil The evil spell
###5234 Throw some water in the well
###5237 And smile in Jamaica
###5243 In Jamaica, yow
###5246 In Jamaica
###5250 In Jamaica yow
###5269 In Jamaica
###5273 In Jamaica yow
###5277 In Jamaica
###5281 In Jamaica yow
###5299 
###5302 
###5316 
###5322 
###5324 
###5325 
###5331 - After the shooting, he was... I wouldn't say scared, but just hurt.
###5336 Too hurt to face Jamaica.
###5338 - I was the one who escaped with him out of Jamaica after the shooting.
###5342 Yeah... me and him.
###5344 He didn't say a word the whole way through.
###5349  We went to Nassau first, and then he went on to London.
###5353 Don't worry
###5356 About a thing
###5360 'Cause every little thing
###5362 Gonna be all right
###5366 Singing don't worry
###5369 About a thing
###5373 'Cause every little thing
###5375 Gonna be all right
###5377  I think he just wanted to take a break.
###5381 He wanted to not be looking over his shoulder.
###5383 He wanted not to be dealing with the problem,
###5384 not dealing with the controversy.
###5387 He just wanted some free head space to work,
###5390 to make music, to tour.
###5392 Singing sweet songs
###5395 - We moved immediately into Chelsea area.
###5398 Oakley Street.
###5399 It was a great experience because
###5403 we're all together...
###5404 in this house.
###5406 - Well, on each floor there was a different musician.
###5409 There was, uh, Tyrone Downie on one floor,
###5411 Carlton Barrett on another floor,
###5413 "Family Man" Barrett on another floor,
###5415 Alvin "Seeco" Patterson on another floor.
###5418 Neville Garrick, I think, was in the basement sharing with somebody.
###5422 - We were a stone's throw from Battersea Park Bridge.
###5425 Once we went over the bridge, then you had a football field.
###5430 We even played against some National Front guys.
###5433 We whupped them a couple of times.
###5436 
###5438  Did he feel like he was in exile?
###5439 - Yeah, man.
###5441 But Bob was, like, deeply into creation of music.
###5445 That's how I think he satisfied his soul.
###5450  Bob's life was spared, and he was very happy to be alive.
###5453 See, Jah gave him another chance.
###5457  He was also confronted by his mortality.
###5460 And when you think that these might be your last opportunities to do anything,
###5465 you place a greater value on every moment,
###5469 every second of every moment of every day.
###5471 There is no time. We've got no time to lose.
###5476  He slept basically about four hours a day.
###5479 And he was always writing a song.
###5481 You know, you'd be up all night writing, and then he'd go...
###5484 I'd say, "Oh, Bob. I've gotta go get some sleep now."
###5486 He'd go, "Just half an hour more."
###5487 Half an hour would turn into four hours, you know.
###5489 
###5491  Bob liked to write early in the morning.
###5495 Come the morning, him have this gravelly voice, you know,
###5498 like kind of Rod Stewart-ish kind of thing.
###5500 
###5509  He would be working out the melody, working out the melody,
###5512 and then the lyrics would come after.
###5516 Would that leave you there
###5520 There's something I have to play
###5523 It's that way every day
###5528 Children mark my word
###5531 It's what the Bible say
###5537 
###5542 And Miss World 1976...
###5546 is Miss Jamaica!
###5548 
###5549  And the Royal Albert Hall is in uproar.
###5553 Incredible! Cindy Breakspeare.
###5555 The 21 -year-old health club operator gets the sash.
###5558 I think she's as overwhelmed as anyone.
###5560 - At the time I won Miss World,
###5562 Bob was not yet a household name in England.
###5564 But because he was now tied to me,
###5566 and Miss World was definitely a household name,
###5570 we kind of... we complemented each other very nicely.
###5573  Cindy completely overwhelmed by the emotion of the moment.
###5576 And Wilnelia Merced crowns the new Miss World 1976.
###5583  It was considered quite...
###5587  Outrageous? - Yeah, that's a good word.
###5589 "Outrageous" works.
###5591 But Bob loved the achievement, you know? He loved the achievement.
###5595 I don't think there's a man alive who doesn't want to get "the girl."
###5599 And so...
###5601 
###5606  Would he have liked it if you had become a Rasta?
###5610 Um, yes, I think he would have liked it.
###5613 Things would always come up.
###5617 Uh, how you present yourself as a woman.
###5619 What's appropriate wear, cover your hair, this, that.
###5621 Here I am on the train coming in from all parts out of London,
###5626 and, you know, they've got this tiny little triangular sink
###5629 in the bathroom on the train, and I'm washing all the make-up off.
###5634 Anyway, one night I wasn't able to do that,
###5637 and I came home in full regalia...
###5639 red nails, fur coat, fully made up.
###5642 And no sooner than I walked through the front door and closed it,
###5645 he walked in behind.
###5648 I turned around, he looked at me and said, "Ah, I catch you."
###5661 I wanna love you
###5664 And treat you right
###5666 I wanna love you
###5671 Every day and every night
###5674 We'll be together
###5679 With a roof right over our heads
###5682 We'll share the shelter
###5687 Of my single bed
###5690 We'll share the same room Yeah
###5695 For Jah provide the bread
###5699 Is this love is this love is this love
###5702 Is this love that I'm feelin'
###5707 Is this love is this love is this love
###5710 Is this love that I'm feelin'
###5716  Exodus was huge.
###5718 That was our biggest album ever there.
###5720 Just mash up Europe, and it's tearing down America.
###5724 They're waiting for us.
###5725 - And then the American tour was canceled...
###5728 because Bob was having problems with his toe.
###5731 - Somebody stepped on it with their spike boots.
###5736 And then it started to get infected...
###5739 because Bob would still play football the next day on it...
###5742 and the next day.
###5743 - And that went on for some time...
###5747 before they realized what it really was.
###5750 - They came up with a definitive diagnosis of melanoma.
###5756 - And they tested and they found out that...
###5759 that was more like a white person sort of sickness.
###5763 It wasn't coming from a black source.
###5765 It was the whiteness in him that allowed it to get this bad.
###5771  What did they recommend he should do about it?
###5773 - They recommended disarticulation at the hip.
###5777 In other words, remove the entire leg.
###5780  The doctor in England told him he had to cut his whole leg off.
###5784 Was that... Do you remember that?
###5785 - No.
###5787 Had to cut off his... his toe.
###5791 It was definitely not his leg.
###5793 - A lot of people told Bob that once you cut your toe off...
###5797 your big toe especially...
###5798 you won't be able to dance anymore.
###5800 - He loved football, so...
###5804 I think the thought of having his toe amputated
###5807 was just unacceptable to him.
###5808 - So, this other doctor we saw in Miami said,
###5812 "No, it's not necessary.
###5815 We can just take off a portion of it.
###5818 We don't have to remove the whole toe.
###5820 You can just take off the whole nail bed, and you know,
###5823 it wouldn't be necessary."
###5826  He got very bad advice from the people that was around him.
###5846 
###5850 Until the philosophy
###5853 Which hold one race superior
###5856 And another
###5859 Inferior
###5862 Is finally
###5865 And permanently
###5868 Discredited
###5871 And abandoned
###5873 Well everywhere is war
###5876 Me say war
###5880 And until there's no longer
###5882 First-class nor second-class citizens
###5885 Of any nation
###5888 Until the color of a man's skin
###5891 Is of no more significance
###5893 Than the color of his eyes
###5896 I've got to say war
###5899 War in the east
###5902 War in the west
###5905 War up north
###5907 War down south
###5910 This a war
###5914 War
###5916 War
###5919 War
###5920 
###5924  There was a movement to bring Bob back...
###5926 because it was felt that he had the potential...
###5928 to heal the very strong division that existed.
###5933 
###5934 - The government was begging...
###5936 because they said Jamaica is lost without Bob Marley.
###5939 We can't say, "Bob is in exile."
###5941 So they got one of their main leader, Claudie Massop,
###5945 to speak to Bob.
###5948 - This guy, he was from the other side of the party...
###5951 Claudie Massop.
###5953 And the next one named Tek-Life.
###5955 I don't remember his right name, but we call him Tek-Life.
###5958 They went up to England to pursue Bob to come down, back to Jamaica.
###5963 - Bob sent for them, in a way,
###5966 to come up, and so they would be on... away from Jamaica,
###5970 away from that political influence,
###5972 and they could reason among themselves.
###5975  The two guys who went up there for him was on the opposition.
###5979 So I would represent the other side,
###5981 so if he say "I don't come,"
###5983 then he ain't coming back to Jamaica.
###5986 So I have to go to England.
###5991  Of those people, how many are still alive?
###5996 - One.
###5999 The one you're speaking to.
###6003 We Jah people
###6005 Can make it work
###6010 Come together
###6013 And make it work yeah
###6017 I'm singing that we
###6020 Can make it work
###6023  Bob started doing that song which is,
###6025 "We, Jah people, shall come together and make it work."
###6027 Then they decided to have a concert, they'd just have a peace concert.
###6031 - Last month a truce was arranged...
###6033 between the rival political factions in Kingston, Jamaica.
###6036 A peace conference was arranged, to be preceded by a peace concert...
###6040 for the people in a very large park.
###6042 They expect over a hundred thousand people there.
###6045 Bob Marley was invited to headline this peace concert.
###6049 Marley has accepted...
###6051 and will return to Kingston, Jamaica.
###6053 Bob, why are you returning to Jamaica?
###6056 - Well, my life not important to me.
###6058 Other people life important.
###6060 My life is only important if me can help plenty people.
###6062 If my life is just me and my own security, then me don't want it.
###6066 My life is for people, as many is.
###6078 
###6082  Busloads of people went out to the airport.
###6086 They stormed the runway.
###6087  When the plane landed,
###6090 they jumped over the barriers and ran towards the plane,
###6092 which was similar to what happened when Haile Selassie came to Jamaica.
###6102 
###6107  It was amazing to see this stadium of 30,000 people.
###6111 People who were opposed politically...
###6114 were sitting beside each other.
###6116 
###6129 I wanna jam with you
###6132 I really wanna jam it with you
###6137 I wanna jam with you
###6140 I really wanna jam it
###6142 I really wanna jam
###6144 I wanna jam with you
###6147 Whoa I hope you like jammin' too
###6150 Well, oh, well-well Oh, well
###6154 
###6156 I wanna jam it with you Yeah
###6159 Ooh. Just let me tell you something else.
###6162 Yeah. Hope you like jammin' too
###6165 To make everything come true, we got to be together.
###6169 Yeah. Yeah. I wanna jam it with you
###6172 And to the spirit of the most high,
###6174 His Imperial Majesty, Emperor Haile Selassie I,
###6178 from writing to...
###6182 leading people...
###6184 of the slavery to be here...
###6186 to shake hands.
###6188 Show the people that you love them right
###6191 Show the people that you gonna unite
###6195 Show the people that we're all right
###6199 Show the people that everything is all right
###6202  I actually played a wrong note.
###6204 
###6205 He started singing, "Whoa, watch what you're doing."
###6207 Watch watch watch watch watch watch watch
###6210 Watch what you're doing
###6212 - Everybody thought he was trying to tell the people out there,
###6214 "Watch what you're doing." But he was really talking to me.
###6221 - He was very spiritual.
###6223 This was like, "Hey."
###6229 I'm trying to say
###6231 Could we have...
###6233 Could we have up here, on stage here,
###6236 the presence of Mr. Michael Manley and Mr. Edward Seaga?
###6241 Whoa
###6245 I just want to shake hands and show the people...
###6247 that we gonna be all right.
###6250 We gonna unite
###6251 We're gonna make them right
###6254 We got to unite
###6255 
###6260  He didn't plan it at all. It was spontaneous.
###6265 - I'm waiting. I'm waiting.
###6268 Oh Lord oh Lord
###6271 Help us out I pray
###6277  Anything could have happened at that point.
###6279 I was just praying that the people didn't get foolish and start shooting again.
###6287  There were no preachment or anything like that.
###6289 He just took our hands and said a few words, held it up above his head.
###6295 And at that moment, everybody was one.
###6298 - Love.
###6300 Prosperity.
###6302 Be with us all. Jah.
###6305 Rastafari. Selassie.
###6307 
###6314  He was able to do that.
###6316 He was able to bring people together in that way.
###6319 The same half uptown, half downtown, half black, half white.
###6323 It's that marriage of everything.
###6325 He just embodied it all in one person.
###6342  As his career grows, so grew a better education,
###6345 and a better car, and a bigger house with more rooms.
###6349 But my father would always take us back to Trench Town.
###6353  Sometime Bob would go down the ghetto and, you know,
###6356 pass through and thing like that and would never lock his car up.
###6360 'Cause that's like saying you don't trust people.
###6364  Have you made a lot of money out of your music?
###6366 - Money.
###6369 I mean, what is a... How much is...
###6370 How much is a lot of money to you?
###6372 - That's a good question. Have you made, say, millions of dollars?
###6376 - No.
###6378 - Are you a rich man?
###6380 - When you mean rich, what you mean?
###6382 - Do you have a lot of possessions, a lot of money in the bank?
###6385 - Possession make you rich?
###6386 I don't have that type of riches. My riches is life forever.
###6392  Hope Road was always swarming with people,
###6394 and for the same reason...
###6396 looking for an opportunity, looking for some money,
###6399 looking for a handout, need a job...
###6401 "My children's school fees," on and on and on.
###6403  You have lines every day at Hope Road.
###6406 People from all walks... They bring the baby, they bring the kids.
###6410 You have long lines, and he just hand out...
###6414 He doesn't just give, like, pittance, you know.
###6416 He give you enough that you can start something, you know.
###6420  A couple of years ago, no one would have believed...
###6424 that this raggle-taggle tribe of Jamaican musicians...
###6427 would be packing Toronto's Maple Leaf Gardens.
###6430 It's a sign of reggae's growing acceptance...
###6432 in the international pop music scene.
###6435 And it's also catapulted this man, Bob Marley, to superstardom.
###6441 We don't need no trouble
###6443 No no no no
###6445 - Bob once made a statement. He said they ask him,
###6447 "How big you think this music will get?"
###6450 Bob says, "You know, this music will get bigger and bigger and bigger...
###6454 till it reaches right people."
###6457 Which, to me, is the whole world.
###6460 
###6466 
###6469 - Yes, you know, come a long way.
###6487 Lively up yourself
###6489 And don't be no drag
###6493 Lively up yourself
###6496 For reggae is another bag
###6500 I watched from 200-seaters...
###6502 to a thousand, and then I saw 80,000.
###6506 I saw a hundred thousand.
###6509 'Cause I said so
###6511 What you gonna do You rock so you rock so
###6516  We tore up Europe.
###6517 We played to, like, maybe two million people in six weeks.
###6521 We broke everybody's record over there. The Rolling Stones...
###6525 You skank so You skank so
###6529 Oh yeah
###6532 You come so You come so
###6535 Come alive today yeah
###6538 And lively up yourself
###6541 
###6543 - Yeah!
###6545  He did a concert in Tokyo... 4,000 people.
###6549 Everybody's totally Japanese.
###6551 Singing every song word for word.
###6555  Most of them could not even understand.
###6558 They spoke a different language.
###6560 But they felt the music and they knew what he was saying.
###6564 Lively up yourself
###6566 In the morning time Lord
###6570  The media lied and said that Bob smoke a pound a day.
###6577 And so everywhere we went, the police was on our heels,
###6580 and they would search our belongings with a fine-toothed comb.
###6587 You would see police with dogs on the bus, searching.
###6591 But every time they searched, they never found anything.
###6594 So, they didn't bother with us again.
###6600  Towards the latter years, they're more, like,
###6603 "You have any posters?" like.
###6605 So we basically just came out with the passports,
###6609 a whole bunch of records and posters,
###6612 and they didn't even look, they just stamped.
###6636 
###6641 - One of his main concern was that he wasn't reaching the black people.
###6646 You know, he's noticed all his shows are all white, all white, every show,
###6649 so that kind of was puzzling to him.
###6651 - I was in Nigeria and came back and told him about the response...
###6655 of the people to him in Nigeria,
###6656 who had never seen him, but just the music.
###6659 And he couldn't believe it. I said, "Yes, I'm serious."
###6662 I said, "Africa is really waiting for you.
###6665 As a matter of fact, if you go to Africa, you really might not come back."
###6670 
###6703 Check out the real situation
###6707 Nation war against nation
###6710 Where did it all begin
###6713  Her father was the president of Gabon.
###6716  We didn't know he was a dictator when we went, but we found out.
###6718 It was, like, "Okay, we're here. It's too late. Let's just play."
###6726 And his daughter was in love with Bob.
###6730 
###6743  To Bob, Africa is the motherland, you know,
###6746 and he loved Jamaica, but he was in transit.
###6748 Africa was his destination.
###6751 And everything is just for a while
###6754 It seems like total destruction
###6757 The only solution
###6758  You don't die and go to heaven. You have to live in heaven.
###6762 Africa is our heaven because that's where we come from.
###6769 
###6809 - Everywhere we went, the kids were running beside the bus...
###6813 and waving and hollering,
###6815 "Bob Marley! Bob Marley! Ganja! Ganja!"
###6818 We said, "Uh-oh."
###6822 
###6841 - Bob asked me to find out from Pascaline...
###6844 how much money we were actually paid.
###6847 And what she told me was a lot more money than what Bob was told by Don.
###6854 
###6866 - He kick him down.
###6869 Leapt across the room and kick him down.
###6872 - Yeah, I saw him kick his ass.
###6875 In fact, we questioned him for almost three hours that night on tape.
###6879 - We were on the 23rd floor,
###6881 and they kind of held Don outside the window for a minute.
###6885 - Bob would ask him the same question, like, maybe half an hour later,
###6888 and he answered different,
###6890 and Bob said, "Garrick, rewind."
###6893 Ding! Play.
###6895 And then, "Wasn't you said that, boy?"
###6898 Slap him couple of times. Shit!
###6901 Hey!
###6905  It was the policy of keeping Africans in their place,
###6909 which, by 1965,
###6911 made Rhodesia illegal in the eyes of the world.
###6915 - I don't believe in black majority rule ever in Rhodesia.
###6920 Not in a thousand years.
###6929  Bob wrote a song called "Zimbabwe."
###6931 "Natty mash it in-a Zimbabwe.
###6934 I 'n' I liberate Zimbabwe."
###6936 And when the song got to Zimbabwe,
###6938 the freedom fighters embraced that as their anthem.
###6941 - They got their independence.
###6943 Finally, they got their independence,
###6946 and they sent representatives here to Jamaica...
###6949 to ask Bob to perform.
###6952 - They wanted him to come, and when they saw the cost,
###6955 they said they couldn't afford it.
###6957 - And so Bob Marley used his own money...
###6961 and shipped equipment, I think, from London to Zimbabwe.
###6969 Zimbabwe
###6970 Africans a-liberate Zimbabwe
###6974  You had dignitaries from all over the world.
###6978 You're right you're right you're right you're
###6983 
###6989 - I, Robert Gabriel Mugabe,
###6992 do swear that I will well and truly serve Zimbabwe...
###6997 in the office of minister of the government,
###7001 so help me God.
###7003 
###7007  Midnight, the exact moment of independence.
###7011 As Prince Charles, Governor Soames
###7012 and hundreds of visiting heads of government...
###7015 and V.I.P.s from around the world watched,
###7017 the new flag was raised, Robert Mugabe's government assumed power,
###7021 and Zimbabwe was born.
###7029 Exodus
###7032 Oh Lord
###7034 Movement of Jah people
###7040  It was the first time anybody in Zimbabwe...
###7043 had heard anything like this.
###7045 But when the first song started,
###7048 the 90,000 people outside,
###7050 who couldn't get in, decided to come in.
###7053 Men and people will fight you down
###7056 When you see Jah light
###7059 Let me tell you if you're not wrong
###7061  It was the freedom fighters...
###7063 heard Bob Marley inside the stadium,
###7065 and they are locked out, not being able to go in,
###7069 and they just flattened the fence.
###7071 So, being there, on stage,
###7074 I remember I was the first person
###7076 to smell something unusual.
###7078 It was tear gas.
###7081  There was this strange sensation that was burning our throats,
###7086 and it felt as if we were gonna die.
###7088 We didn't know what it was, and we felt that we're gonna leave Jamaica,
###7092 and come all the way to Zimbabwe to leave our kids and just die here.
###7096 So, Rita, Marcie and I,
###7099 we ran off the stage,
###7101 and the musicians were coming off one by one.
###7103 But Bob was still in his element, and he...
###7106 I guess he didn't even realize what was happening.
###7114 - That just open my eyes to know
###7116 that this man was ready to go down with his people.
###7119 Whatever the reason was, Bob didn't run nowhere.
###7124 
###7125 So when we got back on stage with Bob,
###7128 this is what Bob said to us:
###7130 "Now I know who are the true revolutionaries."
###7134 Well well well well Jah come to break oppression
###7138 Rule equality yeah
###7142 Wipe away transgression
###7145 Set the captives free
###7147 Set the captives free now
###7150 Set
###7154 Set the captives free yeah
###7159  And I think that was one of his highlights of a dream.
###7164 He was at home.
###7171 Thank you very much. Zimbabwe!
###7174 Freedom!
###7178 
###7181  Did Bob want to reach a black audience in America?
###7184 - Of course he did.
###7185 Bob, until he died, he did.
###7187 The last concert in New York was to try to get...
###7191 African American, R & B airplay in America.
###7196 Bob had a cult following in America,
###7200 and when you go to a Bob Marley concert, it was sold out,
###7203 but it was white.
###7210  Yeah, the black people in America were not responding.
###7213 It was always a big thing.
###7214 We always talked about it. We always wondered why.
###7218  So, Frankie Crocker, the number-one jock in the country...
###7222 said that I got a concert with The Commodores.
###7225 "We'll guarantee you three months of airplay...
###7228 if Bob would open for the Commodores."
###7231 We said, "You gotta be crazy.
###7233 The Commodores should be opening the show for Bob Marley, not in reverse."
###7236 I went back to Bob, and Bob said, "No problem."
###7239 
###7260 Could you be loved
###7265 And be loved
###7270 Could you be loved
###7275 And be loved
###7280 Don't let them fool ya
###7283 Oh, no
###7289 Or even try to school ya
###7292 Oh, no
###7297  When we did the Madison Square Garden show,
###7301 that night was history.
###7304 If what you're thinking is not right
###7308 Love will never leave us alone
###7311 Every single one that was in the audience...
###7314 stood on their feet to acknowledge this man.
###7318 Whoa-ho
###7320 Could you be loved
###7325 And be loved
###7330 Could you be loved
###7334 And be loved
###7337 Oh
###7339 Could you be loved Could you be could you be loved
###7342  I think the doors of America was opened to Bob right there.
###7348 
###7360 Marley! Marley! Marley!
###7362 Marley! Marley! Marley! Marley! Marley!
###7366 Marley! Marley! Marley! Marley! Marley! Marley!
###7372 
###7377  The next day, we were out in Central Park jogging,
###7380 and we was going up this hill, and all of a sudden he...
###7385 he stumbled,
###7387 and we went and we laid him down on the side of the trail,
###7390 and he... he started shaking, and he had foaming at the mouth.
###7395 And I said... when I looked at him, he looked real strange.
###7398 And the guys gathered around him, they said something in patois.
###7403 And he hollered "Rastafari" and jumped up off the ground.
###7406 Scared me to death. I mean, he was there, shaking and foaming.
###7409 Next thing I know, he done... he just jumped up.
###7414  We took him to the hospital next door to my house.
###7419 The doctor told Alan and me...
###7422 that Bob Marley had cancer and that it had spread.
###7426 - He had cancer all over his body...
###7430 lungs, brain, all over the place.
###7433 It was incredible that he was able to keep working.
###7437  But the doctor told us that we shouldn't do anything,
###7443 that we should just let him stay on the concert tour,
###7446 that he was so strong and powerful,
###7448 that one day he was gonna walk out on stage and he was gonna fall dead.
###7453 But that he could not be treated...
###7456 and he could not be helped.
###7460 How did he take the news?
###7461 - Bad. He took the news bad.
###7468  I knew he'd had a problem with his toe before that,
###7471 but...
###7472 I'd forgotten about it.
###7475 I think everybody seemed to have forgotten about it...
###7478 because if he'd been going to regular checkups,
###7482 you know, he might... he might be around today.
###7485 But... - He just didn't go to his checkups?
###7488 - No.
###7498  The next stop was Pittsburgh,
###7502 and we were waiting for Bob to come on the bus...
###7506 for all of us to drive to Pittsburgh.
###7508 And we never saw Bob.
###7513 - Finally, he arrived,
###7515 and he was looking very, very stressed, I remember,
###7519 and we went to do a sound check,
###7522 and I remember we did the sound check...
###7526 with one song...
###7528 and we did that song for maybe two or three hours.
###7532 "I'm Hurting Inside."
###7536  It's the longest sound check we have ever had.
###7539 It just felt like, "Why?" We didn't understand.
###7549 - We had a meeting before the show, half an hour before the show,
###7552 and we were told by Alan Cole that this was gonna be our last concert.
###7557 And, of course, we were all, like, in shock.
###7560  Before we went on stage, he said to me,
###7563 "I want you to stay pretty close in case anything should happen."
###7566 I'm saying, "Nothing's gonna happen to you. Everything's gonna be all right."
###7569 But he just said, "Stay close, in case." Just in case he got a seizure.
###7573 I wanna love you
###7576 I wanna love and treat
###7579 Love and treat you right
###7581  He put on the show, but it wasn't the same.
###7584 He didn't have the same energy.
###7586 But the people kept him pumped up 'cause this...
###7589 so many people in the audience, and they were, "Bob! Bob!"
###7596  They called for an encore, and we were saying,
###7598 "Lord, I wonder if he can do it."
###7600 And he went out, and he did the encore. He did about four songs.
###7607 And they called for another encore, and I'm saying,
###7611 "Jesus, I wonder if he's gonna fall out on this one."
###7614 But he did it.
###7616 He did it.
###7618 And that was the last time we performed on stage together.
###7629 
###7631  Thank you very much, Pittsburgh! Yeah.
###7634 
###7637 If you keep jumping like this, we'll have to come here every year!
###7641 Every week, every month!
###7645 Thank you.
###7651  I was with him the whole time in New York...
###7654 when he was being treated at Sloan-Kettering.
###7655 I was with him every day.
###7657 I was with him when he was getting chemo, and his locks fell out.
###7666  The weight of the locks was just too heavy.
###7668 The few hairs that were still holding was beginning to be really uncomfortable,
###7672 and he decided to cut it.
###7674 That was quite a night.
###7678 It was myself, Rita... a group of us women.
###7682 We lit candles, and we were reading from the Bible.
###7685 We were reading the Book of Job,
###7688 and, uh, we cut.
###7691 - I said to him, um,
###7696 "You going for the Rude Boy look?"
###7698 And he laughed. It was funny. But it was really, really sad.
###7703 About the saddest thing I can ever remember.
###7707 - That was the first time I saw him,
###7712 like, without his hair.
###7714 You know, he looked, like, so tiny.
###7737  Him say, "Listen, we're gonna fight it. All right?
###7740 Regardless of what the doctors might say or what they might do,
###7744 we're gonna fight it.
###7747 'Cause a Rasta never give up."
###7749 - Left to me, I would have said,
###7751 "Bob, come home to Saint Ann
###7753 and come eat roast fish and callaloo every day.
###7755 Smoke the biggest spliff if you like,
###7757 drink fish tea, just do what you want.
###7761 And if you end up in the same place at the end of it all,
###7764 at least you will have had some comfort
###7767 in your last months on this earth...
###7770 and being in a place that you really, really wanted to be in."
###7773 But we girls didn't have much talk in those days, you know.
###7776 The men made the decisions.
###7778 
###7787 Old pirates yes they rob I
###7791 Sold I to the merchant ships
###7796 Minutes after they took I
###7800 From the bottomless pit
###7804 But my hand was made strong
###7809 By the hand of the Almighty
###7812 We forward in this generation
###7818 Triumphantly
###7821 Won't you help to sing
###7826 These songs of freedom
###7829 'Cause all I ever have
###7835 Redemption songs
###7839 Redemption songs
###7843  He was living in a house just down the road.
###7845 It was actually in walking distance from the clinic.
###7848 But I mean, you had to put boots on halfway up your thigh to get through the snow.
###7853  I'm telling you, I had to wear dark glasses because it was so white.
###7858 The lake was frozen three feet deep.
###7861 You could drive a car over it.
###7864 I said, "This is a fridge where they keep people alive."
###7868 No, Rottach-Egern... I'll never forget that.
###7872  Dr. Josef Issels was the ultimate...
###7876 in holistic therapy at that time.
###7877 But what made him more interesting, he was the only doctor...
###7880 who had actually cured a melanoma on the planet Earth.
###7886 
###7927 - I went to Germany for his, uh, 36th birthday.
###7932 Rita was there. Cindy was there.
###7935 His mom was there.
###7939 It was kind of frustrating in a sense...
###7941 because I know the type of person Bob is.
###7945 Him didn't want us to see him in that state.
###7951 Bob had a stroke, I think, on the left side.
###7954 So he was frustrated he couldn't finger a guitar.
###7959  So when you left him, you thought he might get better?
###7962 - Yeah. I was definitely hoping...
###7964 Well, he was trying to tell me that... that he's gonna beat this thing.
###7968 You know?
###7969 Gonna beat this thing.
###7973 
###7997 
###8014  I think people then started going after his wealth.
###8018 I think that it was... it had become...
###8021 a bloodthirsty-type situation,
###8024 where people knew he was gonna die,
###8028 and they was just... they just surrounded him.
###8035 - That's why Bob never write a will, I feel.
###8039 Bob will never want to give up.
###8041 It seems like when you write a will, it's like you say,
###8044 "Well, you know, I'm checking in."
###8049 So I think that was one of the reasons.
###8050 I think one of the reasons, too,
###8052 is he's not the type of person who would say,
###8054 "Now, okay. I leave this for Ziggy, Cedella."
###8058 You know, like, divide up. And "Okay, what should I leave for Seeco...
###8061 and Neville and Carly and..."
###8065 That's not Bob.
###8067 Where the Bob I know, by leaving it open like that,
###8070 everybody reveal who they really were.
###8074 You get me? - Hmm.
###8077 - Who really did love him, who fighting over the money.
###8080 Yeah, man. Him does say, but that's how he is. Bob left it open.
###8088  The doctor said that he couldn't do anything more for Bob,
###8093 and if we were going to leave,
###8094 we'd have to do it within 48 hours.
###8099 - So I said, "I'm on my way back. I'm coming back to Germany this week."
###8103 And he said, "No, don't come."
###8106 He's coming to Miami.
###8108 - We decided, you know, that...
###8110 we'd just rent a plane, you know.
###8115 Bob wanted to know if it's a Concorde.
###8117 I said, "No.
###8120 No Concorde."
###8134  So I brought up all the kids from... who was in Jamaica.
###8137 Some of them my kids. Some from other mothers.
###8141 So I gathered everyone and said, "Come. Daddy want to see you all."
###8144 - I remember me and Ziggy were sitting outside,
###8148 and some preacher guy came from Jamaica,
###8151 another one came from the Ethiopian Church,
###8155 and I'm telling Ziggy, "Ziggy, he's gonna be all right, you know?
###8158 'Cause, I mean, look... look how many people are praying."
###8160 - My memory was going to the intensive care unit,
###8165 doing "peep," going like this,
###8167 looking through the window, you know, like, going...
###8170 And him lay down there, and him kind of see me, and him go...
###8173 him go, "Come."
###8175 So I went in, I went beside him, and him say, you know,
###8179 "What up, young Bob?" You know, "What's up, young Bob?"
###8182 And, um, "I've a song for you."
###8186 You know, him say, "I have a song for you."
###8189 And him... him sing a couple of lines of the song,
###8191 "On your way up, take me up. On your way down, don't let me down."
###8197 - You know, like the one time you're kinda hoping...
###8200 you can have him for yourself...
###8206 
###8208 And it wasn't supposed to happen again, you know?
###8226 Haile Selassie
