###3 <i>Here's the deal:</i> <i>Turk and Elliot wrote a paper</i>
###6 <i>on peripheral vascular disease,</i>
###7 <i>They're upset because they</i> <i>have to present it at a conference,</i>
###10 Do you know how many interns would die to do that?
###13 Not me, l don't care. l know my paper was a trillion times better.
###17 lt's so political. Surprise! They went with the black guy and the girl.
###21 - Bambi. - What?
###24 What right do they have to be mopey?
###26 <i>That's when Elliot said</i> <i>something that explained everything,</i>
###29 Our parents are coming.
###32 Oh, l am so sorry.
###33 <i>I could tell my friends were upset,</i>
###36 - <i>Still there was a bright side,</i> - lt's all right.
###38 <i>I knew I could make it worse,</i>
###40 - Missed a spot! - You could help!
###42 - You can't even hear the TV! - l like the pictures.
###45 <i>If I believed in karma</i>
###46 <i>I'd be more cautious</i> <i>about giving these guys a hard time,</i>
###49 Hey, Dad. No, no, nothing.
###52 Turk and Elliot are freaking out because their parents are coming.
###56 <i>But karma doesn't scare me,</i>
###57 No. lt hasn't been that long since you and l saw each other.
###61 - Dad? - Hey, Mr Dorian.
###62 Hey, boys, what's shakin'?
###64 - Who needs a beer? - Who doesn't?
###67 You see, JD, this is what goes around.
###70 But this? This is what comes around.
###72 - Get out of here. - Only two left.
###74 - That's all right. JD'll go out. - Oh, get some chips.
###94 Wowser, Rowdy's a boy dog.
###96 <i>My mom and dad</i> <i>got divorced when I was seven,</i>
###99 <i>That's not unusual but though</i> <i>everybody's relationship</i>
###102 <i>with their father is different mine has</i> <i>always seemed very different,</i>
###106 God, l'd like to take a run at her. Look at that rack.
###109 - Dad, please. - l'm sorry, Johnny. l'm just a man.
###112 - You know what they say about men. - They love boobies.
###115 That's is correct, Christopher.
###117 OK, you know, l think l'm gonna hit the sack
###120 before l get even more uncomfortable.
###122 Your mother had a beautiful bosom.
###124 - There it is. - Would you stay?
###126 We've got a lot of catching up to do. Please.
###128 OK.
###131 You guys have a policy on farting?
###133 No, let 'er rip.
###135 Fire in the hole.
###137 Oh, my God, Dad.
###139 Count it!
###141 That was a nice moment.
###146 <i>I guess everyone's parents</i> <i>drive them crazy,</i>
###148 So this is my hospital.
###151 lt's stunning.
###154 Honey, is there a rule against looking pretty here?
###158 Nothing official.
###160 l just think you would look so much more handsome in blue scrubs.
###164 Thank you, Mommy,
###165 but l like my green scrubs better.
###168 <i>Parents have a way of making</i> <i>their children regress,</i>
###171 l don't want to wear blue scrubs!
###174 Come on. Boy, you better watch your manners.
###177 Come on, now.
###179 You can't have one, sweetheart. Perms are for trailer trash.
###183 What in the hell is this, parents' weekend?
###186 Sort of. Elliot and Turk wrote this paper,
###188 then my dad decided ''l wanna come too,'' so...
###190 Look, Reba, if l ask you a question
###193 that doesn't specifically deal with a medical issue,
###196 you can bet your powdered bottom l don't want you to answer.
###199 - Do you understand? - Yeah.
###201 lt's like working with a monkey.
###207 - What? - Nothing.
###209 Why didn't you introduce me to your mother?
###211 Because she just came by to say ''hey'' before she checked into her hotel.
###215 She's coming back later to look around.
###217 OK. l was worried you thought she might not like me.
###220 She's not gonna like you. Baby, look.
###223 My mother's never called any girl l've been with by her name.
###226 She called my college girlfriend The Big Easy.
###229 Well, was she fat and slutty?
###231 She had beautiful skin.
###233 Don't smile, woman. She did.
###235 Just beautiful.
###237 So, what do you guys think?
###239 l think it's time to get back to the suite and get in a bath.
###242 This place makes me feel dirty.
###245 Dr Kelso? Dr Kelso, these are my parents.
###249 Ah, well!
###251 lt's a pleasure to meet the trees from which our little acorns fall.
###254 - Bob Kelso. - Simon Reid.
###256 l'm chief of medicine at St Augustine's.
###258 lt's a private hospital in Greenwich.
###261 l know what you're thinking. You didn't ask.
###264 Nobody ever does.
###267 So, how long are you guys staying?
###272 Can l help you, sir?
###275 - Sir? - You can help me
###277 by minding your own damn business.
###280 Excuse me?
###282 Oh, aggressive, huh?
###285 Do you really want to get it on with me, pipsqueak?
###288 Because if you do, l guarantee
###290 it'll be the last stupid thing you ever do on God's green earth.
###295 Nice meeting you.
###297 <i>What the hell was that all about?</i>
###301 Dad. Don't wander off like that.
###305 This is your basic arthrocentesis there.
###308 Your resident should've shown you how to do this.
###311 <i>He can't be that mad,</i>
###312 <i>Even though residents</i> <i>are supposed to teach you</i>
###315 <i>they only show up</i> <i>when they want something,</i>
###317 l have to give the students a lecture on heart murmurs.
###320 - Could you do it? - Actually...
###322 Thanks, man.
###325 That sucks. l totally wanted to spend some time with my dad tomorrow.
###329 Then take him.
###331 - What do you mean? - l don't know?
###333 Secure some kind of vehicle, car, balloon, tricycle,
###336 and transport your father from where he is to where you're going.
###339 l don't think you get my dad.
###341 He's not interested in my work. He's more of like a buddy.
###343 OK. That was my mistake.
###346 Here, l engaged you and gave you the impression that l actually care,
###350 which is just so wrong! God!
###353 The thing is, l don't need a buddy.
###355 What l need is a father.
###357 You definitely need something.
###359 Maybe a backbone. Or perhaps some testicles.
###362 At the very least, a pillow that you could carry around the hospital
###366 and just cry your sad eyes out into whenever trauma...
###370 l have testicles.
###373 He's a kidder.
###376 All right, this is it.
###377 Brace yourself and let me handle this nice and smooth.
###380 All right? Hey, Mom, guess what.
###383 Hi, Mrs Turk, l'm gonna cut to the chase.
###385 l'm Carla. l apologise if your son hasn't told you about me.
###388 l don't know how you've put up with him as long as you did.
###391 Still, you should know he loves me very much,
###394 l feel the same and we're really good together.
###396 - Are you two sharing a bed? - No!
###399 Yes, ma'am, we are.
###400 But if you're a good judge of character, you can tell l'm not messing around.
###404 - Carla. lt's a nice name. - Thank you.
###408 - Yes, it is, Mother. - Oh, please. Not telling me about her.
###411 Dear, do me a favour. Don't give him any for a month or so.
###414 - Done. - lt can't go down like that.
###416 lt just can't go down like that.
###420 After you, sir.
###422 Well, l'll be.
###423 l haven't seen a ward like this since Vietnam.
###425 So where in Connecticut was your National Guard unit stationed?
###429 - Amusing. - l thought so.
###431 l think they're totally getting along, don't you?
###435 l'm about to open a fat can of whup-ass on you.
###438 Bring it on, bitch.
###441 All right, sports fans, we have a guest today at rounds,
###446 so let's try and be sharp.
###448 Why don't we begin with,
###450 l don't know, Dr Reid.
###452 What is the nutritional cause of high output cardiac failure?
###456 Wet beriberi from thiamine deficiency.
###458 Yes, it is. Next question.
###461 Why don't we try...
###465 ...Dr Reid.
###467 l already went, sir.
###469 - Oh, are you done for the day? - No.
###473 What's the mechanism of Cheyne-Stokes respiration in systolic dysfunction?
###477 <i>What? Nobody knows that,</i>
###479 Prolongation of circulation time from lung to brain
###481 causing diminished sensitivity of the respiratory centre
###484 to arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide?
###486 Yes.
###494 My dad winked at me!
###496 lf that's not saying, ''l love you, l'm proud of you,''
###498 - l'm not sure what is. - l know!
###500 There are no gratuitous winks in the Reid household.
###503 <i>And that's when I decided</i> <i>to take a chance,</i>
###506 l'd love to come to your heart murmur lecture. l'm a big fan of those things.
###510 That means a lot, Dad.
###512 <i>Absolutely, Please,</i>
###514 Oh, dear Lord, please make it stop.
###518 - lt's stunning. - Thank you.
###520 - And l understand that you... - l make these.
###522 Like two wolves gabbing about which sheep to eat.
###526 Unfortunately for them, l'm a man.
###530 - Turk. - Coming.
###533 - Thanks. - Thank you.
###535 Hi, Mrs Turk.
###537 John Dorian, get over here.
###541 After all these years, are you still afraid of me?
###544 On Thanksgiving, l said your turkey was dry, and you picked me up and shook me.
###548 - Then don't say that. - Silly Bambi.
###550 You guys, leave him alone.
###552 l've had enough of you two conspiring and whatnot. lt ends now!
###555 lt is so cute when he thinks he's in charge.
###558 - l know. lt kills me. - <i>And that's when it happened,</i>
###561 You should see him when l pretend to let him...make a decision!
###567 <i>That's when Carla realised</i> <i>she was exactly like Turk's mom,</i>
###577 Great job at rounds today, Dr Reid.
###579 - Thank you, sir. - Your dad must've been very impressed.
###582 Yeah, l think so.
###584 l could tell that he respected you, sir.
###586 Well, that's very nice, but lucky for me,
###589 my self-esteem isn't tied up in that kind of poppycock.
###592 l didn't become a doctor to impress my daddy or anyone else.
###595 l did it for me.
###597 l've seen lots of doctors get into this for the wrong reason.
###600 - You know what happens to them? - No.
###602 They quit and get their real estate licence.
###606 You look upset, sweetheart.
###608 You shouldn't be.
###610 l think you'd look super in a gold blazer.
###612 Thank you?
###616 This is almost too easy.
###621 Well, work is great, Johnny.
###622 l like to believe that l'm selling dreams.
###625 - But, Dad, you sell office supplies. - Yeah, l prefer to call them dreams.
###630 l'm gonna steal another Jell-O.
###633 <i>I always thought parents</i> <i>were like tornadoes,</i>
###636 <i>They blow into town</i> <i>and devastate everything in their path,</i>
###640 - Hi. - There's no food on your tray.
###643 Oh.
###644 <i>But it's different for me,</i>
###648 How you doing, Elliot?
###652 Great talk. Anyway, Johnny,
###655 l was talking to my buddy, Jake, this afternoon.
###658 - You remember Jake? - No.
###660 Jake's my buddy, and he's leaving the country
###663 for who knows how long. So l thought l might
###665 get out of here tomorrow and go catch up with him.
###668 l'd miss your thing,
###670 but l wouldn't know what l was hearing anyway.
###672 - Right? - Right.
###674 <i>I think what surprised me the most</i>
###676 <i>is that I was actually surprised,</i>
###678 You still talking to yourself?
###680 l thought you'd outgrow that by now.
###688 <i>I probably should've</i> <i>woken him up to say goodbye</i>
###691 <i>considering he'd be gone</i> <i>before I got home,</i>
###693 <i>I told myself I wanted to let</i> <i>the old guy get some sleep</i>
###696 <i>but even I didn't believe that,</i>
###703 You keep eating that,
###705 there'll be nothing left for a man to put a ring on.
###707 Mom...
###709 ...l started therapy.
###711 Do you know that Amy Swanson's marrying Drew Gertson?
###714 Drew is such a nice boy.
###716 Drew used to hold people down and spit in their mouths.
###719 He doesn't do that anymore.
###720 Mom, when l was a little girl, did l want to be a doctor?
###723 Maybe l used a toy stethoscope on one of my dolls?
###726 Oh, honey, you'd have to ask the nanny.
###729 Have you ever reached a point in your life
###732 when you really wished you knew how you got there?
###734 Are you trying to tell me you're a lesbian?
###737 Yes, l am.
###738 Yep.
###740 That's exactly... exactly what l'm saying, Mom.
###745 Yo, JD. You want to grab a bite to eat with us tonight
###748 after we do our presentation?
###750 Yeah, l'm not that busy.
###752 lf you're not busy, you have time to do this discharge summary.
###755 - l meant that later l'm not that busy. - Fantastic.
###758 l told my mom you like that Cuban restaurant. She loves Cuban food...
###762 l hate that restaurant.
###764 You said you loved it and wanted to be buried in a vat of <i>plátanos</i>
###768 so you could eat your way out.
###769 See? That's our problem. You don't get me.
###772 No argument there.
###776 Hey, hey, hey! You missed a spot, right there.
###779 Well, lucky for me, Dad,
###780 l spend my life going in a circle around this place cleaning up after the sick.
###784 Tomorrow l'll probably be here at the same time.
###787 You know that l hate sass, so drop right down and give me 20.
###791 - That could be faecal matter. - Make it 30.
###793 Fine.
###796 <i>What is it with parents?</i>
###797 <i>Why is it so easy for them</i> <i>to make us feel bad?</i>
###800 - ...three... - Sound off like you've got a pair!
###803 Dad, l don't gotta put up with...
###805 You've got to at least try and pace yourself.
###807 Otherwise, sure as shooting, you're gonna burn out.
###810 Come.
###813 l heard the sad sigh, l see your shoulders are slumped,
###816 and l'm aware that you have some problem
###818 you want to talk to me about.
###820 You probably think it'll be cathartic to get it off your chest,
###823 but believe me, it won't be.
###825 What you've got to do, for me, is the healthy thing.
###828 Keep all of your feelings bottled up inside where they so belong.
###832 My dad flaked on me again.
###835 l'm sorry. You're not on drugs, are you?
###838 What? No.
###839 Are you in jail? Have you been beaten? Are you malnourished?
###843 l skipped lunch, but l've been snacking.
###845 You are, in fact, a perfectly healthy 26-year-old doctor
###848 who keeps crying about how horrible his father was.
###851 Well, he did some considerable emotional damage, so...
###854 Every one of our parents does considerable emotional damage,
###858 and from what l've heard,
###860 it just might be the best part of being a parent.
###863 lf some guy ever does put a ring on your finger,
###866 and you're lucky enough to pop out a youngster, l'm sure you'll understand.
###869 But for now, trust me when l tell you that l wouldn't care
###873 if today was the first time you ever even met your daddy.
###876 Because in reality,
###879 well, he could've done a much, much worse job.
###882 OK.
###885 All right, look, at the presentation,
###888 could l do the ending? l really love the end of our paper.
###892 Do you think that l'm cut out to be a doctor?
###894 OK, fine. You can do the ending.
###896 l just want to say, ''Thanks, folks. We've been great.''
###899 l'm serious. Do you think this is what l really want to do?
###902 Elliot, l don't know.
###904 You can tell me. l can take it.
###906 No, l'm saying ''l don't know'' because l really don't know.
###910 What the hell is going on here?
###913 Why have all women gone crazy?
###917 l'm not crazy. Am l?
###919 No. Shh.
###921 lt's OK, Elliot. You're normal. You're normal.
###924 - Turk? - He's not here.
###927 Turk.
###930 l do like that Cuban restaurant.
###932 l think the important thing is that we got through this together.
###936 l'm freaked out because your mom and l have lots in common.
###939 - So? - l don't know.
###942 l got this crazy idea that you only fell for me
###944 because l'm just like your mom.
###947 Baby...
###950 That's exactly why l fell for you.
###953 OK. l'll probably have a friend pick up my stuff.
###956 Wait. Sit down.
###959 What's wrong with wanting someone
###961 because they're smart, independent and always looking out for you?
###967 OK?
###968 Yeah. But if we ever get married, we'll have to talk about this in therapy.
###974 Relax. l don't do this with my mama.
###978 l hope not.
###981 - Oh, yeah, Mama. - Oh, that's just wrong.
###985 Oh, Mama.
###988 <i>Part of me</i> <i>thought Cox was wrong,</i>
###990 <i>I had every reason</i> <i>to be angry with my father,</i>
###992 So, how's it going down there?
###994 lf it's OK with you, we just won't talk right now.
###997 Got a needle. Need to focus.
###1000 <i>Then I stopped</i> <i>thinking of my dad as a father</i>
###1002 <i>and started thinking of him as a man,</i>
###1005 <i>And I realised some things that</i> <i>deep down I probably always knew,</i>
###1009 <i>Like maybe he wasn't crashing on my</i> <i>couch to spend more quality time with me</i>
###1013 <i>but because he couldn't</i> <i>afford a hotel room,</i>
###1015 <i>And maybe he wasn't going</i> <i>to see his buddy Jake to catch up</i>
###1018 <i>but because Jake was someone</i> <i>he might be able to sell something to</i>
###1022 <i>and he really needs a sale,</i>
###1024 <i>Maybe the truth is he's</i> <i>just a middle-aged lonely guy</i>
###1027 <i>struggling to get by</i> <i>and it sure would be nice</i>
###1030 <i>if someone gave him</i> <i>a break once in a while,</i>
###1032 Hey, Dad.
###1034 Hey, there he is.
###1036 l thought you had to work all day.
###1038 l did, but l got someone to cover for me.
###1040 l wanted to make sure l caught you and let you know
###1043 how cool it was to see you.
###1045 - Really? - Yeah.
###1047 Wow, l...
###1050 Well, listen, l'm, you know,
###1053 l have to travel a lot lately, so...
###1055 ...l'm sure l'll be back in this region again soon.
###1059 So l could swing back out and see you.
###1063 - That'd be great. - Great.
###1065 - Great. - Great. l'd be happy to see you.
###1069 Yeah, we could do that.
###1070 You've been taking advantage of the farting policy.
###1073 Hey. Pull my finger.
###1075 - l'm not gonna pull your finger. - See what happens.
###1080 l pooed a little.
###1082 Dr Kelso.
###1084 Well, if it isn't Daddy's little girl.
###1086 l wanted to tell you what happened to me.
###1088 l'm going to keep eating my soup,
###1090 but you rest assured l'm holding my breath on the inside.
###1093 First, l came out to my mother.
###1095 Well, then,
###1097 it appears the boys in radiology owe me quite a bit of money.
###1100 But this afternoon...
###1102 <i>,,,a patient puked on me,</i>
###1105 <i>And I smiled,</i>
###1108 Do you know why l was smiling?
###1109 Because l really like what l do.
###1111 You were right. l got into this for the wrong reasons.
###1114 But now that l'm here, l can't imagine being anywhere else.
###1117 l still don't like your father.
###1120 Oh, me neither, sir.
###1122 Oh. They were all out.
###1128 Placement of the stent in haemodynamic results of PTA are inadequate.
###1132 Or primary stent placement at the initial time of PTA...
###1134 <i>Maybe the mistake we make</i> <i>is thinking our parents will change,</i>
###1138 <i>And maybe they did a betterjob</i> <i>than we give them credit for,</i>
###1141 <i>Maybe there</i> <i>amid all the crap they dumped on us</i>
###1143 <i>are some things worth keeping,</i>
###1145 <i>Like a passion for something</i> <i>you never knew you had,</i>
###1148 ...recent trial of 283 patients...
###1150 <i>Or the ability to surround</i> <i>yourself with people who love you,</i>
###1153 ...subsequent stent placement only increases... ln conclusion,
###1157 the difference between the strategies
###1159 is not significant at either short-term or long-term follow-up.
###1164 Thank you very much, folks, we've been great.
###1178 And ''Z'' is for the Zs that you'll be getting
###1181 cos you now know heart murmurs from A to Z.
###1185 Thank you.
###1190 - What are you doing here? - l just figured l'd come, check it out.
###1193 You know, see how you're doing.
###1196 And for the record, that was atrocious.
###1198 l mean, downright abysmal.
###1199 l know, but did you see A through K?
###1201 l did a cool thing with A through K.
###1203 l showed up at Y, as in ''Why, dear God? Why?''
###1208 You know, this has got to be
###1210 the most piss-poor, sorry excuse for a hospital
###1212 that l have ever set foot in.
###1214 Well, Dad, in that case, feel free not to stop by every day you're in town.
###1218 Goodbye, Son.
###1222 l'll see you tomorrow.
###1224 Yeah.
###1227 Parents, huh?
###1229 Tell me about it.
###1231 Yeah. What's that, a shot at my dad?
###1233 That's stepping over the line, pal.
###1235 l missed this.
###1238 Yeah. �
