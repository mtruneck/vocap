2
0:0:33,807 --> 0:0:36,407
- Manny.
- Hm.


3
0:0:36,407 --> 0:0:39,967
- Manny.
- Hm.


4
0:0:39,967 --> 0:0:48,767
- (Sighs) Manny.
- Ah-ah.


5
0:0:48,767 --> 0:0:51,687
What time is it? Can we close up yet?


6
0:0:51,687 --> 0:0:54,807
Hey, you're still open. It's Friday night.


7
0:0:54,807 --> 0:1:1,887
Friday night? We should have
been closed hours ago.


8
0:1:1,887 --> 0:1:4,367
Time to get out of these work clothes.


9
0:1:4,367 --> 0:1:6,967
Look, Bernard, look at my new phone.


10
0:1:6,967 --> 0:1:11,87
It's got web access, it's got a camera,
it can do everything.


11
0:1:11,87 --> 0:1:16,127
- Can it stop boring conversations?
- No, none of them can do that.


12
0:1:16,127 --> 0:1:20,567
Mine can. Shut up about your phone.


13
0:1:20,567 --> 0:1:24,247
I think tonight's
gonna be something special.


14
0:1:24,247 --> 0:1:28,287
- We should open our best bottle.
- Not the Â£4.49!


15
0:1:28,287 --> 0:1:33,967
Tonight's the night. This is
the stuff Napoleon would have drunk


16
0:1:33,967 --> 0:1:39,47
if he'd been a bit strapped
and he couldn't get anything else.


17
0:1:39,47 --> 0:1:41,927
Mm. Mm! Audacious.


18
0:1:41,927 --> 0:1:45,687
Mm. Look at the robe on that.


19
0:1:45,687 --> 0:1:48,527
Mm. (Sniffs) Ah, strawberry notes.


20
0:1:48,527 --> 0:1:52,367
I'm getting caramel, I'm getting bitumen.


21
0:1:52,367 --> 0:1:55,687
I'm getting red wine up my nose!


22
0:1:55,687 --> 0:2:1,207
Notice anything different about me?


23
0:2:1,207 --> 0:2:4,727
You've turned into a heron.


24
0:2:4,727 --> 0:2:7,807
No.


25
0:2:7,807 --> 0:2:11,647
Wait a minute, I've got it.
Your ears are bigger.


26
0:2:11,647 --> 0:2:15,47
My hair! Isn't it perfect? Aren't I divine?


27
0:2:15,47 --> 0:2:17,327
I'm more me than I've ever been.


28
0:2:17,327 --> 0:2:20,247
I can't believe you didn't notice.


29
0:2:20,247 --> 0:2:25,367
Men have a different way of noticing
hair. Which is not noticing it.


30
0:2:25,367 --> 0:2:28,567
Gianni, my stylist,
only charged me 85 quid.


31
0:2:28,567 --> 0:2:32,447
My stylist is free.
He's called Manicio.


32
0:2:32,447 --> 0:2:35,687
I do it with a bread knife. Zip, zip, zip.


33
0:2:35,687 --> 0:2:40,407
- I'm feeling a bit top-heavy.
- Ahh.


34
0:2:40,407 --> 0:2:51,287
Mm. Mm. S...


35
0:2:51,287 --> 0:2:57,127
Mm. (Trills)


36
0:2:57,127 --> 0:3:0,607
Why am I here,
wasting my hair on your eyes?


37
0:3:0,607 --> 0:3:3,647
I should be getting slavishly admired.


38
0:3:3,647 --> 0:3:7,527
Ah, but you will.
Because tonight... we go out.


39
0:3:7,527 --> 0:3:10,47
- Why?
- Cos it's Friday.


40
0:3:10,47 --> 0:3:12,127
It's Friday night.


41
0:3:12,127 --> 0:3:16,207
It was Friday night last week
and it'll be Friday night every week


42
0:3:16,207 --> 0:3:20,447
until we're dead and even then the
whole, rotten business will go on.


43
0:3:20,447 --> 0:3:24,207
But it's Friday now
and we're here, young, alive.


44
0:3:24,207 --> 0:3:27,687
- He's right. We should go out.
- What are the options?


45
0:3:27,687 --> 0:3:30,247
- Erm... cinema.
- No smoking.


46
0:3:30,247 --> 0:3:34,47
- Bowling.
- Can't do the shoe thing.


47
0:3:34,47 --> 0:3:44,207
- Theatre.
- (AII laugh)


48
0:3:44,207 --> 0:3:48,647
What about a restaurant?
We could try Yo! Liver.


49
0:3:48,647 --> 0:3:51,327
- I know of a party.
- What party?


50
0:3:51,327 --> 0:3:55,367
- My friends John and Ann. Teachers.
- What's the place like?


51
0:3:55,367 --> 0:3:58,727
Big kitchen/living room. Friendly place.


52
0:3:58,727 --> 0:4:3,767
Right. So, it's a fridge-centred
25 to 40s party.


53
0:4:3,767 --> 0:4:7,287
Chilli-shaped fairy lights,
beer in the bath.


54
0:4:7,287 --> 0:4:10,247
Lots of yuppies, dinkies and yummies.


55
0:4:10,247 --> 0:4:14,327
Lively fun but it won't
get out of hand. Yes, I'm listening.


56
0:4:14,327 --> 0:4:17,127
- My hair says, "Go, baby!"
- Yes!


57
0:4:17,127 --> 0:4:20,7
- Sounds awful. How far is it?
- Two minutes.


58
0:4:20,7 --> 0:4:23,727
Too far. We're not going.
We've got all we need here.


59
0:4:23,727 --> 0:4:28,487
Oh, that means it's just us three again.


60
0:4:28,487 --> 0:4:32,287
- We could sit in the garden.
- (Both) Garden?


61
0:4:32,287 --> 0:4:36,207
There's a garden out the back.
I'm sure it's still there.


62
0:4:36,207 --> 0:4:51,727
Come on.


63
0:4:51,727 --> 0:4:58,47
(Traffic humming)


64
0:4:58,47 --> 0:5:1,327
Right, so you don't want
to sit in the garden.


65
0:5:1,327 --> 0:5:7,647
We'll just have a nice glass of wine, OK?


66
0:5:7,647 --> 0:5:11,767
There's more here somewhere.


67
0:5:11,767 --> 0:5:15,207
Ooh, no. No, there isn't, Bernard.


68
0:5:15,207 --> 0:5:17,367
Friday night, no booze.


69
0:5:17,367 --> 0:5:19,847
Crisis. What can we do?


70
0:5:19,847 --> 0:5:25,207
I know, we'll go to the party.
That's what we'll do!


71
0:5:25,207 --> 0:5:29,367
I am picking up a certain keenness
from you about this party.


72
0:5:29,367 --> 0:5:32,967
- There's no other reason to go?
- Absolutely not.


73
0:5:32,967 --> 0:5:37,767
- Except there is a... girl.
- A what?


74
0:5:37,767 --> 0:5:40,487
Girl. She's gonna be there.


75
0:5:40,487 --> 0:5:44,7
I've met her before
and I was hoping to meet her again.


76
0:5:44,7 --> 0:5:46,367
We don't have to wait for Bernard.


77
0:5:46,367 --> 0:5:50,527
It has to be all three.
If I go with you and get talking to her,


78
0:5:50,527 --> 0:5:55,367
then you'll be hovering, hovering.
And a girl gets awkward, awkward.


79
0:5:55,367 --> 0:5:59,487
Because she thinks that
you and I are a thing, thing.


80
0:5:59,487 --> 0:6:5,687
But all three of us go, then I catch
her eye, peel off, natural, natural.


81
0:6:5,687 --> 0:6:8,87
We need Bernard to get to my person.


82
0:6:8,87 --> 0:6:12,527
You know I don't approve
of you seeing other girls... people.


83
0:6:12,527 --> 0:6:15,807
Who is she, this so-called person?


84
0:6:15,807 --> 0:6:18,527
Rowena. She's a friend of Ann's.


85
0:6:18,527 --> 0:6:23,447
Oh, I see. Ro-weena.


86
0:6:23,447 --> 0:6:27,7
Ro-weeena.


87
0:6:27,7 --> 0:6:30,447
(Farting noise)
And what am I supposed to do


88
0:6:30,447 --> 0:6:34,567
when you do the underpants-Charleston
with this insane, blind tart?


89
0:6:34,567 --> 0:6:36,687
Why are you so angry?


90
0:6:36,687 --> 0:6:41,287
- I always get angry when I'm furious.
- It's no big deal.


91
0:6:41,287 --> 0:6:46,487
Before you move to the country
to raise your bearded freak circus...


92
0:6:46,487 --> 0:6:49,607
What's she like?
What are her prospects?


93
0:6:49,607 --> 0:6:52,47
- She's nice.
- Oh, she's nice?


94
0:6:52,47 --> 0:6:56,327
Don't make me get sick
into my own scorn.


95
0:6:56,327 --> 0:7:1,727
Does she play the viola? Embroider?
Is she kind to the servants?


96
0:7:1,727 --> 0:7:5,847
I just know that I like her.
And there's a chance she likes me.


97
0:7:5,847 --> 0:7:9,687
- That's all.
- Right, we are going to this party.


98
0:7:9,687 --> 0:7:13,207
Cos I'm trying to picture
this girl who likes you.


99
0:7:13,207 --> 0:7:17,487
And all I can see is you in a dress.


100
0:7:17,487 --> 0:7:21,527
- Come on, come on.
- Oh, oh, wait. We can't go yet.


101
0:7:21,527 --> 0:7:26,807
- (Both) Why?
- I need my kit.


102
0:7:26,807 --> 0:7:29,767
Kazoo. Snuff.


103
0:7:29,767 --> 0:7:31,807
Thimbles. Amulet.


104
0:7:31,807 --> 0:7:36,367
Swabs. Plums.


105
0:7:36,367 --> 0:7:40,407
It's things to accidentally
leave behind, near to Rowena.


106
0:7:40,407 --> 0:7:43,967
She'll find them later
and I can ring her up.


107
0:7:43,967 --> 0:7:47,887
Can't you just ring and say,
"I'd like to see you again"?


108
0:7:47,887 --> 0:7:55,767
Don't be stupid.
I don't want her to think I'm gay.


109
0:7:55,767 --> 0:7:58,887
- Can we go now?
- Yeah. Let's par...


110
0:7:58,887 --> 0:8:6,287
Don't you dare you the word "party"
as a verb in this shop!


111
0:8:6,287 --> 0:8:12,807
Let's p... otter along
in order to attend the party.


112
0:8:12,807 --> 0:8:15,447
- Fran, get the wine.
- Sure.


113
0:8:15,447 --> 0:8:17,487
What? Lies! Subterfuge!


114
0:8:17,487 --> 0:8:28,567
Seething corruption!


115
0:8:28,567 --> 0:8:31,767
(Drunken singing, crashing about)


116
0:8:31,767 --> 0:8:34,447
(Man) Oi! You lot! Be quiet!


117
0:8:34,447 --> 0:8:36,607
(AIl) Shut up!


118
0:8:36,607 --> 0:8:40,727
(Bernard) Is it here?
(Fran) No. Here. You live... here.


119
0:8:40,727 --> 0:8:43,127
(Bernard) The key won't go in the thing!


120
0:8:43,127 --> 0:8:54,727
- Bernard, you're using your finger.
- Oh, yeah.


121
0:8:54,727 --> 0:9:0,727
- My hair. Is my hair still good?
- Yeah, you're a vision.


122
0:9:0,727 --> 0:9:3,767
See? I told you about hair power.


123
0:9:3,767 --> 0:9:8,567
Three blokes put their phone numbers
into my new phone.


124
0:9:8,567 --> 0:9:12,847
Look.


125
0:9:12,847 --> 0:9:16,287
I'm dancing.


126
0:9:16,287 --> 0:9:19,767
- Why aren't you dancing?
- There's no music.


127
0:9:19,767 --> 0:9:23,367
Sing us a song, then. You're Irish.


128
0:9:23,367 --> 0:9:27,127
That's what the Irish do
after a drink, isn't it?


129
0:9:27,127 --> 0:9:29,327
What would I sing?


130
0:9:29,327 --> 0:9:33,407
Mm... something about cliffs
and a girl with golden black hair.


131
0:9:33,407 --> 0:9:35,687
And the English all being bad.


132
0:9:35,687 --> 0:9:40,207
- Sing it yourself.
- Fine.


133
0:9:40,207 --> 0:9:44,367
# Oh, Eamonn, Danny dear


134
0:9:44,367 --> 0:9:48,207
- # I miss the Galway Bay
- (# Generic Irish tune)


135
0:9:48,207 --> 0:9:52,367
# And I'll sing for all I got


136
0:9:52,367 --> 0:9:56,7
# And a riddle-diddle Dublin
and a riddle-diddle Donegal


137
0:9:56,7 --> 0:10:3,527
# The English are all bollocks #


138
0:10:3,527 --> 0:10:6,647
Oh, no. This is no good,
we need proper music.


139
0:10:6,647 --> 0:10:9,247
Let's have a dancing competition.


140
0:10:9,247 --> 0:10:13,767
I'll go first and then it's you, Manny, OK?


141
0:10:13,767 --> 0:10:19,327
(# Motorhead: The Ace Of Spades)


142
0:10:19,327 --> 0:10:23,7
'# Pushing up the ante
I know you got to see me


143
0:10:23,7 --> 0:10:27,167
- # Read 'em and weep... #
- I'm going next. That's rubbish.


144
0:10:27,167 --> 0:10:30,607
I saw you at the party -
you embarrassed us.


145
0:10:30,607 --> 0:10:34,367
- I'll have you any day.
- You can't do this.


146
0:10:34,367 --> 0:10:38,207
# The ace of spades
the ace of spades #


147
0:10:38,207 --> 0:10:40,927
Why would I want to do that?


148
0:10:40,927 --> 0:10:53,167
Why would I want to when I can do this?


149
0:10:53,167 --> 0:10:56,927
(Music stops)


150
0:10:56,927 --> 0:11:2,607
- (Coughs and splutters)
- Oh...


151
0:11:2,607 --> 0:11:5,247
(Fran) Oh...


152
0:11:5,247 --> 0:11:9,487
Oh! What is this... I'm drinking?
It's disgu...


153
0:11:9,487 --> 0:11:15,607
It's like a choc ice
fell into a bottle of bleach.


154
0:11:15,607 --> 0:11:20,407
It's children's booze! What's yours?


155
0:11:20,407 --> 0:11:25,487
Bludge. It's quite good, actually.
You don't even have to drink it.


156
0:11:25,487 --> 0:11:30,807
You just rub it on your hips and
it eats right through to your liver.


157
0:11:30,807 --> 0:11:36,847
- Manny, what's yours?
- Delicio's beetroot liqueur.


158
0:11:36,847 --> 0:11:41,847
- Give us a bit. Swap, come on.
- No. It's mine!


159
0:11:41,847 --> 0:11:45,647
Manny, don't be a baby.
It sounds nice. Pour some.


160
0:11:45,647 --> 0:11:48,647
I'll have one with ice and on fire.


161
0:11:48,647 --> 0:11:51,687
- Come on.
- It's mine. It's all mine!


162
0:11:51,687 --> 0:11:55,447
- I'm gonna get blind drunk.
- Don't be silly.


163
0:11:55,447 --> 0:11:58,167
- You'll regret it tomorrow.
- No!


164
0:11:58,167 --> 0:12:1,47
Why are you always
bringing the mood down?


165
0:12:1,47 --> 0:12:4,87
I didn't wanna leave that party,
it was great.


166
0:12:4,87 --> 0:12:8,327
No, it wasn't! The music
was too loud, the food was cold.


167
0:12:8,327 --> 0:12:10,727
The drinks were few
and the people many.


168
0:12:10,727 --> 0:12:15,927
It was everything I expected.
And less.


169
0:12:15,927 --> 0:12:21,367
I'm never going outside again
unless I need someplace to throw up.


170
0:12:21,367 --> 0:12:24,847
Anyway, you got your chance with her.
What did you talk about?


171
0:12:24,847 --> 0:12:31,87
Offshore wind farms.


172
0:12:31,87 --> 0:12:33,287
I couldn't think of anything else.


173
0:12:33,287 --> 0:12:37,327
Never mind. I'm sure you left
a bunsen burner behind.


174
0:12:37,327 --> 0:12:40,47
You can get it tomorrow and propose.


175
0:12:40,47 --> 0:12:43,967
No! I couldn't find
the right moment to plant anything.


176
0:12:43,967 --> 0:12:48,607
She kept following me around, in
the kitchen, the bedroom, bathroom.


177
0:12:48,607 --> 0:12:52,647
Every time I put something down,
"You dropped your kazoo.


178
0:12:52,647 --> 0:12:56,967
"Ooh, you got snuff on your plums."


179
0:12:56,967 --> 0:13:0,247
A total waste of time.


180
0:13:0,247 --> 0:13:4,287
Frankly, you're doomed.
You and all the shy people are.


181
0:13:4,287 --> 0:13:7,967
Natural selection
favours the loud and aggressive.


182
0:13:7,967 --> 0:13:14,47
I don't mean this in a bad way
but genetically you are... a cul-de-sac.


183
0:13:14,47 --> 0:13:17,967
OK. OK, I tried.
All right? It didn't work.


184
0:13:17,967 --> 0:13:22,47
At least I tried to make
a connection with another person.


185
0:13:22,47 --> 0:13:25,447
When have you ever done that? Eh?


186
0:13:25,447 --> 0:13:30,807
Exactly. You don't actually have a heart,
Bernard. Just a shard of ice.


187
0:13:30,807 --> 0:13:33,607
- Flint.
- Sorry?


188
0:13:33,607 --> 0:13:37,47
Flint. I always saw it as a piece of flint.


189
0:13:37,47 --> 0:13:40,407
Oh. You don't see yourself as a human.


190
0:13:40,407 --> 0:13:44,887
You... you... you're some kind of
superior species, aren't you?


191
0:13:44,887 --> 0:13:50,367
Homo Bernardus. Scorning every fool
who believes in happiness.


192
0:13:50,367 --> 0:13:54,727
Manny, shush.
This is the beetroot talking.


193
0:13:54,727 --> 0:13:56,647
You don't know what love is.


194
0:13:56,647 --> 0:13:59,927
You don't un... You don't know!


195
0:13:59,927 --> 0:14:4,847
- I had a girlfriend. She died.
- And anyway... What?


196
0:14:4,847 --> 0:14:7,887
That's right. Her name was Emma.


197
0:14:7,887 --> 0:14:11,647
Somebody you barely know
knocked you back. Big deal.


198
0:14:11,647 --> 0:14:14,7
I should be living with her by now.


199
0:14:14,7 --> 0:14:17,887
Instead, every morning
I look through my cornflakes


200
0:14:17,887 --> 0:14:21,327
to see your big,
mad, snaggle-toothed head.


201
0:14:21,327 --> 0:14:30,327
So excuse me if I'm a bit...
out of sorts sometimes.


202
0:14:30,327 --> 0:14:33,447
Would you like some beetroot liqueur?


203
0:14:33,447 --> 0:14:37,87
You can have it.
You can have the whole bottle.


204
0:14:37,87 --> 0:14:40,767
Really, I mean it.
You can have nearly all of it.


205
0:14:40,767 --> 0:14:45,247
- Whoa! Don't go mad.
- I don't feel like a drink, anyway.


206
0:14:45,247 --> 0:14:50,647
I'm making tea. Who wants tea?


207
0:14:50,647 --> 0:14:54,807
That is the saddest story I've ever heard.
Poor Bernard.


208
0:14:54,807 --> 0:14:56,847
The worst part of it is...


209
0:14:56,847 --> 0:15:2,47
She isn't actually dead.
She lives the other side of Priory Road.


210
0:15:2,47 --> 0:15:4,87
What?


211
0:15:4,87 --> 0:15:7,407
Bernard told me about her
three years ago.


212
0:15:7,407 --> 0:15:12,47
A year after that, I started doing
this exercise class run by a clown.


213
0:15:12,47 --> 0:15:16,967
- Yeah?
- Circusise, it was called.


214
0:15:16,967 --> 0:15:20,727
We had to wear
these really, really big shoes.


215
0:15:20,727 --> 0:15:23,367
So the step stuff was really hard.


216
0:15:23,367 --> 0:15:25,567
It was like this. It went...


217
0:15:25,567 --> 0:15:28,87
(Honks) Two, three, four.


218
0:15:28,87 --> 0:15:30,487
(Honks) Two, three, four.


219
0:15:30,487 --> 0:15:32,927
And throw the bucket of water.


220
0:15:32,927 --> 0:15:36,447
- (Honks) Two, three...
- Yeah, Fran, Fran.


221
0:15:36,447 --> 0:15:40,167
- Try to stick to the story.
- Oh, right. Yeah.


222
0:15:40,167 --> 0:15:45,167
Afterwards, we'd go for a pizza.
One time, we talked about boyfriends.


223
0:15:45,167 --> 0:15:48,487
This girl, she says
that she once got engaged


224
0:15:48,487 --> 0:15:51,807
to this awful Irish guy...


225
0:15:51,807 --> 0:15:57,527
called...


226
0:15:57,527 --> 0:16:1,567
Bernard. The only way
she could think of getting out of it


227
0:16:1,567 --> 0:16:9,207
was to get her friends
to say she was dead.


228
0:16:9,207 --> 0:16:13,687
- But she wasn't... dead?
- No, Manny.


229
0:16:13,687 --> 0:16:19,167
Which is why she was having
a pepperoni with extra cheese...


230
0:16:19,167 --> 0:16:21,327
years later.


231
0:16:21,327 --> 0:16:25,807
- Why haven't you told Bernard?
- Oh, I couldn't deal with all that.


232
0:16:25,807 --> 0:16:30,767
Can you imagine? All the shouting
and the blaming. No, be very messy.


233
0:16:30,767 --> 0:16:33,807
No, now, listen. Oi, you don't tell him.


234
0:16:33,807 --> 0:16:36,407
- Don't you ever tell him.
- No.


235
0:16:36,407 --> 0:16:40,367
- No, Manny, I mean it.
- I won't. I won't do it.


236
0:16:40,367 --> 0:16:44,247
- Not even in ten or even 20 years.
- No, no way.


237
0:16:44,247 --> 0:16:47,727
- No, no.
- What about a nice game of Monopoly?


238
0:16:47,727 --> 0:16:50,487
Oh, yeah, that is a good idea.


239
0:16:50,487 --> 0:16:54,327
Yeah. Yeah. OK, all right.
Here we go.


240
0:16:54,327 --> 0:17:0,247
So, OK, Fran, you be the hat.
I'll be the dog and, Bernard, you...


241
0:17:0,247 --> 0:17:6,327
She's alive! Bernard, she's alive!


242
0:17:6,327 --> 0:17:15,287
Fran told me. Fran knows her!
Ask her. Ask Fran.


243
0:17:15,287 --> 0:17:17,367
Emma lives in London.


244
0:17:17,367 --> 0:17:20,727
Still. I'm sorry, Bernard.


245
0:17:20,727 --> 0:17:25,87
- So, you're saying she must have...
- Yeah.


246
0:17:25,87 --> 0:17:28,567
I don't believe you.


247
0:17:28,567 --> 0:17:32,207
Well, look. She's in my phone.


248
0:17:32,207 --> 0:17:35,567
That's her full name, isn't it?


249
0:17:35,567 --> 0:17:41,847
I... I still don't believe you.


250
0:17:41,847 --> 0:17:45,567
That's her and me at her last birthday.


251
0:17:45,567 --> 0:17:51,407
One of the many she'll have,
still being alive.


252
0:17:51,407 --> 0:17:54,327
Her dental records.


253
0:17:54,327 --> 0:17:57,887
It can't be her!


254
0:17:57,887 --> 0:18:0,287
OK. Here's her birth certificate.


255
0:18:0,287 --> 0:18:4,327
I keep it safely inside
the envelope with the photo of her


256
0:18:4,327 --> 0:18:6,727
reading yesterday's newspaper,


257
0:18:6,727 --> 0:18:11,847
wearing an "I love life" T-shirt.


258
0:18:11,847 --> 0:18:15,567
So. So... house rules as usual.


259
0:18:15,567 --> 0:18:18,967
Fines in the middle.
If we throw three doubles...


260
0:18:18,967 --> 0:18:23,447
- How long have you known this?
- Couple of years. Does it matter?


261
0:18:23,447 --> 0:18:27,207
Oh! We all want Pall Mall, don't we?


262
0:18:27,207 --> 0:18:30,727
- Who else knows?
- Nobody. Hardly anybody.


263
0:18:30,727 --> 0:18:32,767
A few people.


264
0:18:32,767 --> 0:18:37,47
Mr Singh at the newsagent's.
Oh, and your parents, I told them.


265
0:18:37,47 --> 0:18:40,967
And I tell people at parties
if your name comes up.


266
0:18:40,967 --> 0:18:44,167
Well, maybe I know
a few things about you.


267
0:18:44,167 --> 0:18:49,927
- Maybe I've got a few little facts.
- I've thrown a seven! Beat that.


268
0:18:49,927 --> 0:18:54,607
Manny doesn't know what name you
were born with. Have you met Enid?


269
0:18:54,607 --> 0:18:58,127
N... Don't let's go down this road.


270
0:18:58,127 --> 0:19:2,247
The letter you wrote to your mother
as part of the self-help programme?


271
0:19:2,247 --> 0:19:7,527
You couldn't find it. I posted it.


272
0:19:7,527 --> 0:19:11,487
Manny, you did get into
the Open University.


273
0:19:11,487 --> 0:19:19,207
But Bernard tore up the letter.


274
0:19:19,207 --> 0:19:22,447
I read your personal ad, I saw that.


275
0:19:22,447 --> 0:19:25,167
"Intelligent, funny, 30-something female


276
0:19:25,167 --> 0:19:28,767
"seeks solvent man for sex
and possible friendship.


277
0:19:28,767 --> 0:19:31,687
"Sense of humour irrelevant."


278
0:19:31,687 --> 0:19:34,607
- I've been reading your short stories.
- That's different.


279
0:19:34,607 --> 0:19:37,487
Ah, but it's good. Listen to this.


280
0:19:37,487 --> 0:19:40,47
"Feared by men and admired by women,


281
0:19:40,47 --> 0:19:43,967
"Brendan Blake turned
from the window and patted Larry,


282
0:19:43,967 --> 0:19:52,607
"his barely hominoid, milk-fed gimp."


283
0:19:52,607 --> 0:19:55,847
You went to the party looking like that.


284
0:19:55,847 --> 0:20:0,407
(Screams)


285
0:20:0,407 --> 0:20:6,47
I think that covers everything.


286
0:20:6,47 --> 0:20:9,207
- Hello?
- Rowena!


287
0:20:9,207 --> 0:20:11,327
Hi. Hi.


288
0:20:11,327 --> 0:20:13,727
- Hi.
- Hi.


289
0:20:13,727 --> 0:20:16,527
We were talking at the party.


290
0:20:16,527 --> 0:20:19,407
- Yes, hi, hi.
- Hi.


291
0:20:19,407 --> 0:20:23,927
- And you left something behind.
- Did I?


292
0:20:23,927 --> 0:20:26,367
You were drinking out of this.


293
0:20:26,367 --> 0:20:29,607
I thought maybe
you wanted to keep the cup.


294
0:20:29,607 --> 0:20:33,887
So I asked Ann where you lived and...
But you're busy.


295
0:20:33,887 --> 0:20:37,487
- I'm sorry. I'm stupid.
- No, no, no.


296
0:20:37,487 --> 0:20:39,527
Thanks for bringing it.


297
0:20:39,527 --> 0:20:45,607
I'm really, really pleased
that you came round... with... it.


298
0:20:45,607 --> 0:20:49,887
Oh, for Christ's sake!


299
0:20:49,887 --> 0:20:54,7
Well... thanks. Thanks.
I'll just put that there.


300
0:20:54,7 --> 0:20:59,127
Safe and sound.


301
0:20:59,127 --> 0:21:2,487
So... Erm...


302
0:21:2,487 --> 0:21:6,47
- That's about it, really.
- Right. Right.


303
0:21:6,47 --> 0:21:9,927
Well, th... thanks for...
er, bringing it round.


304
0:21:9,927 --> 0:21:12,247
Offer her something, you fool.


305
0:21:12,247 --> 0:21:16,567
Oh. Oh. S-Seeing as you're here,
would you like some tea or coffee?


306
0:21:16,567 --> 0:21:19,47
Or Bovril? Or a herbal coffee?


307
0:21:19,47 --> 0:21:23,167
- Tea's nice.
- Tea! Coming up.


308
0:21:23,167 --> 0:21:27,167
I'll help you make it.


309
0:21:27,167 --> 0:21:31,87
- (Giggling)
- (Footsteps going upstairs)


310
0:21:31,87 --> 0:21:34,607
Aah. Good for Manny.


311
0:21:34,607 --> 0:21:39,247
I'm sorry, I should've told you
about Emma but she asked me not to.


312
0:21:39,247 --> 0:21:42,807
I was too good for her, anyway.


313
0:21:42,807 --> 0:21:47,727
She had arms like a stevedore.
Stay and have a drink, will you?


314
0:21:47,727 --> 0:21:50,527
Oh, no, no. I've gotta go home.


315
0:21:50,527 --> 0:21:53,127
I'm not sleeping in the skip again.


316
0:21:53,127 --> 0:21:57,487
I'll just lie down, just to rest my eyes.


317
0:21:57,487 --> 0:21:59,647
I've got a date tomorrow.


318
0:21:59,647 --> 0:22:4,367
I've gotta look nice.


319
0:22:4,367 --> 0:22:27,407
(Snores)


320
0:22:27,407 --> 0:22:30,807
Could I talk with Emma... Oh, it's you. Hi.


321
0:22:30,807 --> 0:22:33,847
Yes. That's right. That's right, it's me.


322
0:22:33,847 --> 0:22:37,887
I'm very well, th... Actually, no, I'm dead.


323
0:22:37,887 --> 0:22:43,447
That's right, actually, physically dead.
Not funny now, is it?


324
0:22:43,447 --> 0:22:46,487
I'm haunting you, that's what I'm doing.


325
0:22:46,487 --> 0:22:49,287
Well, why don't you f...


326
0:22:49,287 --> 0:22:54,967
You can't hang up on the undead!


327
0:22:54,967 --> 0:22:58,887
(Manny and Rowena giggling)


328
0:22:58,887 --> 0:23:12,87
Shut up!


329
0:23:12,87 --> 0:23:14,127
Did you want something?


330
0:23:14,127 --> 0:23:18,687
Yes, I want not to hear any
squawking or squeaking or squealing


331
0:23:18,687 --> 0:23:21,727
and if I do
I'll throw you both into the street.


332
0:23:21,727 --> 0:23:39,767
Right.


333
0:23:39,767 --> 0:23:42,567
Nighty-night.


334
0:23:42,567 --> 0:23:49,0
Eh?


335
