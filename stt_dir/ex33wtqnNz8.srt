0:0:0,89 --> 0:0:6,21
Hey everyone today I am going to show you how I 
do my foundation makeup routine. I am the most


2
0:0:6,21 --> 0:0:9,55
self-conscious person about my acne. 
I have told you about my acne so many


3
0:0:9,55 --> 0:0:14,229
times I have always gone over how terrible it is. 
I know it doesn't look like it


4
0:0:14,229 --> 0:0:19,449
But taking my makeup off is one of the
 most insecure thing I can do, personally.


5
0:0:19,449 --> 0:0:23,29
it's gotten a lot better which is 
sad to say


6
0:0:23,29 --> 0:0:26,929
i mean it's a good thing to say but
it still looks awful.


7
0:0:26,929 --> 0:0:30,46
sSo I am going to show you what my face looks 
like without makeup


8
0:0:30,46 --> 0:0:31,649
um


9
0:0:31,649 --> 0:0:35,22
Then I am going to show you how I apply my 
foundation so that I look like this.


10
0:0:35,22 --> 0:0:37,6
Also, I am in the living room today


11
0:0:37,6 --> 0:0:39,4
because i feel it


12
0:0:39,4 --> 0:0:43,11
has better lighting then in the other room


13
0:0:43,11 --> 0:0:44,93
So tell me if you like this better or


14
0:0:44,93 --> 0:0:46,78
if you want me to film videos somewhere else


15
0:0:46,78 --> 0:0:50,24
um I hope that this helps you
if you guys have acne or even if you dont


16
0:0:50,24 --> 0:0:53,64
and just want flawless skin


17
0:0:53,64 --> 0:0:58,19
I hope this works for you. i will not go over blush eyes 
or other makeup, I have a contouring


18
0:0:58,19 --> 0:1:2,77
and highlighting video you can look at that.
I will post a link


19
0:1:2,77 --> 0:1:6,78
But this is just how I do my foundation. And it changes just
about every month Im thinking 


20
0:1:6,78 --> 0:1:8,91
to keep updating these kind of videos


21
0:1:8,91 --> 0:1:12,11
just to show you


22
0:1:12,11 --> 0:1:17,7
Hopefully this helps you and hopefully you enjoy
Ill talk to you soon, bye


23
0:1:17,7 --> 0:1:18,909
Here I am with no makeup


24
0:1:18,909 --> 0:1:21,74
No nothing, no eye makeup


25
0:1:21,74 --> 0:1:22,36
and 


26
0:1:22,36 --> 0:1:27,75
and I feel really disgusting
My nose is clogged up Its way too early


27
0:1:27,75 --> 0:1:32,59
um this is probably the most nerve racking
thing that I could possibly do


28
0:1:32,59 --> 0:1:34,909
This is my biggest insecurity


29
0:1:34,909 --> 0:1:37,0
but this is my face


30
0:1:37,0 --> 0:1:41,45
the sad part is that this is a lot better
than it was before


31
0:1:41,45 --> 0:1:45,7
It is still all over my chest my back


32
0:1:45,7 --> 0:1:51,89
um it is everywhere and you can 
see it goes down my neck


33
0:1:51,89 --> 0:1:54,9
uh... its all across the side 
you can see it on the ear


34
0:1:54,9 --> 0:1:58,4
It has been like this and it has gotten a lot better


35
0:1:58,4 --> 0:2:0,92
but it's still really bad


36
0:2:0,92 --> 0:2:3,869
so it is my biggest insecurity


37
0:2:3,869 --> 0:2:8,99
I am wearing my bathrobe and pajamas
Because sometimes I spill makeup


38
0:2:8,99 --> 0:2:10,79
and I don't want to ruin clothes


39
0:2:10,79 --> 0:2:15,669
The first thing I do
because i have extremely oily skin


40
0:2:15,669 --> 0:2:20,149
um I take this smashbox antishine


41
0:2:20,149 --> 0:2:22,2
and what that does


42
0:2:22,2 --> 0:2:27,29
it basically
stops you from getting oily


43
0:2:27,29 --> 0:2:29,309
i get oily around my nose


44
0:2:29,309 --> 0:2:33,289
around a little bit around my T zone
Im only going to take that much


45
0:2:33,289 --> 0:2:37,829
and I will spread this everywhere 
I need to be oil free


46
0:2:37,829 --> 0:2:41,439
for me thats mainly my nose


47
0:2:41,439 --> 0:2:43,469
yeah


48
0:2:43,469 --> 0:2:46,549
I usually do it on my nose every day
sometimes my T zone


49
0:2:46,549 --> 0:2:54,659
it really depends on where you get shiny
most often


50
0:2:54,659 --> 0:2:57,89
Im just trying to get this makeup on
as soon as possible


51
0:2:57,89 --> 0:3:0,949
so that you do not have to 


52
0:3:0,949 --> 0:3:1,849
look at this


53
0:3:1,849 --> 0:3:6,189
Take a primer you can use any primer
you can use


54
0:3:6,189 --> 0:3:10,849
anything rom sephora to 
mac to bare minerals 


55
0:3:10,849 --> 0:3:14,359
You can use any primer
but for me


56
0:3:14,359 --> 0:3:17,959
personally my favorite for a long time
has been veil primer 


57
0:3:17,959 --> 0:3:19,639
made by hourglass


58
0:3:19,639 --> 0:3:24,299
it has sun protection and I put it on my face
and it is just like


59
0:3:24,299 --> 0:3:27,189
rubbing pearls into your skin


60
0:3:27,189 --> 0:3:40,249
because it's like velvet
I can rub my face my face all day long


61
0:3:40,249 --> 0:3:46,769
and i always carry everything that i
do down my neck just because


62
0:3:46,769 --> 0:3:50,669
well I have acne there


63
0:3:50,669 --> 0:3:55,979
the next thing I use is foundation and my daily routine
changes probably every month


64
0:3:55,979 --> 0:3:57,639
maybe even every week


65
0:3:57,639 --> 0:3:58,739
it's nuts


66
0:3:58,739 --> 0:4:3,819
but recently i've started
this is november


67
0:4:3,819 --> 0:4:7,59
now its december I like the Lorac Foundation
But it is heavy


68
0:4:7,59 --> 0:4:12,139
but recently I have been using
where is it


69
0:4:12,139 --> 0:4:16,489
I use a couple different things and recently
I have been hooked on these The Makeup For Ever HD Foundation


70
0:4:16,489 --> 0:4:18,699
I think these are my all time favorite


71
0:4:18,699 --> 0:4:22,349
I think I will use these for the rest of my life
but in a month it will change again


72
0:4:22,349 --> 0:4:25,179
I use numbers 
125 and 120


73
0:4:25,179 --> 0:4:27,33
I used 130 for a little time


74
0:4:27,33 --> 0:4:29,759
but they look like this


75
0:4:29,759 --> 0:4:31,689
all you need is 2 squirts


76
0:4:31,689 --> 0:4:36,169
and you want to spread that all over your face.
You can dot it on


77
0:4:36,169 --> 0:4:37,91
I will scoot closer so you can see


78
0:4:37,91 --> 0:4:45,3
I try to dot it on
I use clean fingers to put on foundation


79
0:4:45,3 --> 0:4:49,509
many people use brushes. I like brushes
I will do a video with brushes soon, 


80
0:4:49,509 --> 0:4:55,18
"Soon" I say that funny I will do the video soon
to show you how. But I


81
0:4:55,18 --> 0:5:0,3
absolutely love using my fingers
I just feel that it is


82
0:5:0,3 --> 0:5:4,909
such better coverage, looks airbrushed
and then I can add layers on top 


83
0:5:4,909 --> 0:5:5,879
If you want to layer foundation


84
0:5:5,879 --> 0:5:9,2
mix it with mac's fix plus spray
from MAC cosmetics


85
0:5:9,2 --> 0:5:13,6
that way it will dry quicker
just put on more layers


86
0:5:13,6 --> 0:5:21,13
and again i like very full coverage


87
0:5:21,13 --> 0:5:25,3
so we want to blend that in together
and this is color 120


88
0:5:25,3 --> 0:5:30,89
after that I use
color 125


89
0:5:30,89 --> 0:5:33,749
as you can see it is a slightly darker
color and i'm going to put this only


90
0:5:33,749 --> 0:5:36,769
on the outer areas on my face
and down my neck


91
0:5:36,769 --> 0:5:40,19
the reason why is because the
lighter color is in the middle of the face


92
0:5:40,19 --> 0:5:41,839
is really going to highlight that


93
0:5:41,839 --> 0:5:44,4
and I always do highlighting and contouring


94
0:5:44,4 --> 0:5:48,449
so it adds to the photoshopped flawless effect


95
0:5:48,449 --> 0:5:51,999
I like to use a headband
to try to protect my


96
0:5:51,999 --> 0:5:53,479
hair line


97
0:5:53,479 --> 0:5:59,139
but its way too early in the morning
so I forgot to grab that


98
0:5:59,139 --> 0:6:0,219
also


99
0:6:0,219 --> 0:6:3,3
make sure you get the bottom of your nose
so you don't have


100
0:6:3,3 --> 0:6:7,58
5 different colors going on there
I also put foundation on my lips


101
0:6:7,58 --> 0:6:11,779
so that I can shape my lips


102
0:6:11,779 --> 0:6:13,72
when you shape your lips take a Q TIP


103
0:6:13,72 --> 0:6:17,25
wherever the foundation is
it looks like your skin


104
0:6:17,25 --> 0:6:21,699
and wherever else it is looks like your
lips I know i look crazy right now


105
0:6:21,699 --> 0:6:24,129
but it works really well


106
0:6:24,129 --> 0:6:25,569
So I will use Mac's


107
0:6:25,569 --> 0:6:28,77
studio finish concealer


108
0:6:28,77 --> 0:6:32,879
in color NC 30


109
0:6:32,879 --> 0:6:37,229
sorry my camera battery died but 
basically what I did is use 


110
0:6:37,229 --> 0:6:37,699
MAC concealer


111
0:6:37,699 --> 0:6:41,649
I dotted it on my problem areas
not much on my neck just big pimples on the face


112
0:6:41,649 --> 0:6:43,2
I put it on my neck in the past


113
0:6:43,2 --> 0:6:46,99
I just emulsify and blended in 
using my finger


114
0:6:46,99 --> 0:6:50,9
if you use a warm brush or warm finger
it works a lot better


115
0:6:50,9 --> 0:6:53,289
and like I said I usually like using my clean 
hands with foundation but I will do a video


116
0:6:53,289 --> 0:6:54,77
with brushes later


117
0:6:54,77 --> 0:6:56,509
Next thing to do


118
0:6:56,509 --> 0:7:0,469
is take two different powders to set the foundation
because the foundation is a little bit wet


119
0:7:0,469 --> 0:7:3,39
and it makes you look a 
little bit oily


120
0:7:3,39 --> 0:7:7,409
so what I will do is 
start off with brush number


121
0:7:7,409 --> 0:7:9,11
134


122
0:7:9,11 --> 0:7:13,169
and i'll actually go with two different colors
the first one is 


123
0:7:13,169 --> 0:7:14,979
Mac NC 5


124
0:7:14,979 --> 0:7:19,499
and i'm going to rub it like this
in a circular motion so


125
0:7:19,499 --> 0:7:20,989
I get it on the brush


126
0:7:20,989 --> 0:7:21,679
um


127
0:7:21,679 --> 0:7:25,309
Im just going to pat the lighter color
pat it over


128
0:7:25,309 --> 0:7:31,539
and tilt my head back so it doesn't spill
and stays on the face and I will pat this


129
0:7:31,539 --> 0:7:32,969
on the inner triangle of my face


130
0:7:32,969 --> 0:7:36,37
I talk about the triangle of the face in 
highlighting and contouring video so if you have not seen it


131
0:7:36,37 --> 0:7:39,39
watch it because it is what
I do after foundation


132
0:7:39,39 --> 0:7:40,629
yeah


133
0:7:40,629 --> 0:7:43,29
but ya basically put this on


134
0:7:43,29 --> 0:7:47,909
that part of your face that you need
it to be lightest which is the very middle


135
0:7:47,909 --> 0:7:55,74
I tilt my head back so that powder stays there
until it is evenly blended


136
0:7:55,74 --> 0:7:58,709
the next thing im using is
smashbox halo


137
0:7:58,709 --> 0:8:1,36
this is in the shade of


138
0:8:1,36 --> 0:8:3,11
Light


139
0:8:3,11 --> 0:8:7,59
and i just got this it is new but I have been using it alot
because I loved the other colors


140
0:8:7,59 --> 0:8:12,249
they were out of the other colors so I 
have to use color light now


141
0:8:12,249 --> 0:8:16,889
but it looks like this and you twist it
twisting it shaves powder off


142
0:8:16,889 --> 0:8:18,35
if you can see that


143
0:8:18,35 --> 0:8:20,549
basically the powder comes out once you
turn it


144
0:8:20,549 --> 0:8:22,919
so you take a bit on top of your brush
and i'm just going to put


145
0:8:22,919 --> 0:8:28,679
this all over the outside of my face
this would be the lower cheeks


146
0:8:28,679 --> 0:8:42,93
up a little bit on the forehead temple
and all over our neck and chest


147
0:8:42,93 --> 0:8:46,45
I will then take one of my favorite powders
it is from the


148
0:8:46,45 --> 0:8:47,7
makeup for ever


149
0:8:47,7 --> 0:8:52,13
this is the HD micro finish powder
and you should probably put it on with a different brush


150
0:8:52,13 --> 0:8:54,98
but Im going to use this one for the sake of
saving brushes because I have to go


151
0:8:54,98 --> 0:8:55,77
later today


152
0:8:55,77 --> 0:8:57,22
and put makeup on friends for a birthday


153
0:8:57,22 --> 0:9:0,22
but as you can see this is just the
finest powder


154
0:9:0,22 --> 0:9:1,66
in the entire world


155
0:9:1,66 --> 0:9:3,65
it is


156
0:9:3,65 --> 0:9:6,95
is just light and fluffy in every way


157
0:9:6,95 --> 0:9:8,79
you see that


158
0:9:8,79 --> 0:9:12,65
and this is a setting powder and
i'm going to use this to set my foundation and powder


159
0:9:12,65 --> 0:9:17,5
because the powders
from mac and smashbox


160
0:9:17,5 --> 0:9:18,54
are a little bit thicker


161
0:9:18,54 --> 0:9:22,29
so this one is so ultra small
it will get into the spaces


162
0:9:22,29 --> 0:9:26,37
that other powders missed


163
0:9:26,37 --> 0:9:27,9
and it smells really fresh


164
0:9:27,9 --> 0:9:34,87
I don't know it smells like clean laundry to me


165
0:9:34,87 --> 0:9:40,3
that ensures that
our entire face is set


166
0:9:40,3 --> 0:9:45,49
mac fix plus spray and I absolutely love
the spray is a dream come true


167
0:9:45,49 --> 0:9:50,49
I will hold it a foot or 16 inches away from my face
close eyes and spray


168
0:9:50,49 --> 0:9:53,24
"spray noises"


169
0:9:53,24 --> 0:9:54,71
"spray noises"


170
0:9:54,71 --> 0:9:57,6
"spray noises"


171
0:9:57,6 --> 0:9:59,79
Like i recommended you can also mix this


172
0:9:59,79 --> 0:10:4,8
with a little bit of foundation you just pump
foundation onto your hand spray it on and mix it with


173
0:10:4,8 --> 0:10:8,3
your brush and put it on with a foundation on concealer brush
fI will show you in another video how to do taht


174
0:10:8,3 --> 0:10:12,25
and that will help
so that you


175
0:10:12,25 --> 0:10:15,76
can layer on more layers
of foundation 


176
0:10:15,76 --> 0:10:20,94
but that is what I do
I let it dry


177
0:10:20,94 --> 0:10:22,399
and Viola, there is it! 


178
0:10:22,399 --> 0:10:24,86
you have flawless looking skin


179
0:10:24,86 --> 0:10:28,42
then I do contouring highlighting blush and eyes
I have other videos on how to do that


180
0:10:28,42 --> 0:10:29,6
feel free to look at them if you have not seen them already


181
0:10:29,6 --> 0:10:34,4
and then I also use a Q tip to take
foundation off of my lips to chose the shape


182
0:10:34,4 --> 0:10:36,92
so that I can control what shape my lips are


183
0:10:36,92 --> 0:10:39,16
I show you that in another video


184
0:10:39,16 --> 0:10:41,16
called "Lip Shaping" 


185
0:10:41,16 --> 0:10:43,27
