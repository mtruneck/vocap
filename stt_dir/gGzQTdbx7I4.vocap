###2 HARRY: I'm Harry.
###3 This is "All Around Losing." And today I'm
###5 learning how to fight.
###6 When this started, it was a lot of fun.
###9 I got to wear the cool mask and the dick guard and
###11 practice punching the air.
###13 But by the time I was getting choked out,
###15 I came to an epiphany--
###16 fighting is hard and passing out is easy.
###20 But if being manly was painless,
###21 everyone would be a man.
###23 My name is Harry.
###24 And I've been a loser for most of my life.
###26 I thought I was done with my awkward phase when "Vice"
###28 hired me to write about politics, culture, and other
###31 important world affairs, which should make me cool.
###33 But it doesn't.
###34 I'm still just a weird kid who creeps people out.
###37 This is "All Around Losing" with Harry Cheadle.
###40 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###45 HARRY: This is Daniel.
###46 He was in the Israeli army for 10 years.
###48 And he lives and breathes Krav Maga.
###51 And this is me.
###53 I'm not very manly or tough.
###54 And I mainly deal with conflict
###55 through nervous laughter.
###57 But I wanted to change all of that.
###58 And because Daniel is such a walking testosterone machine,
###61 I thought I could learn some martial arts from him and
###63 hoped his massive manliness rubbed off on me.
###66 DANIEL: I was in charge of the counter-terrorism
###68 division in my unit.
###70 You work under pressure constantly, so a lot about
###72 psychology.
###74 HARRY: I want to learn how to defend myself against being
###76 choked out, which isn't really a problem right
###78 now, but who knows?
###79 Sounds very intense.
###81 Hopefully nothing bad happens.
###82 And I don't get hurt too much.
###83 But I usually do.
###84 So let's see how this goes.
###86 DANIEL: Three, two, one, go.
###88 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###90 HARRY: First, we did some cardio warm ups, which just
###92 helped remind me how out of shape I was.
###94 Most of my classmates were tough guys who looked like
###96 they hung out in saunas and boxing gyms all the time and
###99 had balls the size of beets.
###101 Even the one woman there was more manly than I was.
###103 Whew, that's hard work, man.
###105 DANIEL: How do you feel?
###107 HARRY: Tired.
###108 DANIEL: Tired?
###108 Don't even start.
###111 HARRY: I know it's still early.
###112 Just try not to fall down, that's what I'm trying to do.
###116 Then, all of a sudden, it was time for the
###118 punching and kicking.
###119 Punching and kicking, in case you've never experienced it,
###122 is no fun and it hurts a lot.
###124 But we kept doing it anyway.
###126 I feel there's a lot of stuff to remember just punching.
###128 All gets out of my head.
###130 [TECHNO MUSIC PLAYING]
###132 HARRY: They played techno music while they pummeled me.
###135 So it was like being in a club, only instead of dancing,
###138 I was getting beat up.
###139 So actually, it was a little less
###141 humiliating than the club.
###143 [TECHNO MUSIC PLAYING]
###149 DANIEL: You OK?
###150 HARRY: Yeah.
###151 DANIEL: You look pale.
###151 HARRY: I'm a little fluid dehydrated, I think.
###154 Dry mouth.
###155 DANIEL: You lost some color.
###156 
###158 HARRY: By the time the class ended, I was ready to stop
###161 with the running and the kicking.
###162 But I felt even less prepared for a fight
###164 than I was going in.
###165 So I asked Daniel for some pointers, both in
###167 fighting and in life.
###168 If they're in a situation, what's the one thing you
###170 should remember?
###171 DANIEL: Run fast.
###172 HARRY: Run fast?
###173 DANIEL: Yes.
###175 HARRY: I felt like I understood Krav Maga and
###177 Daniel's manliness, at least a little.
###179 But it takes more than one day to become a man.
###181 It takes two days.
###182 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###187 HARRY: Krav Maga is really manly.
###190 But it's also a lot of work.
###191 But you know what's not a lot of work?
###193 Firing a gun.
###194 [GUN SHOT]
###195 Whoa.
###197 And also firing a gun is manly because guns are basically
###199 just giant, metal penises that ejaculate death.
###203 I'm here at Cortlandt Manor, New York.
###205 And I'm going to learn how to fire a shotgun from a guy
###207 named Joe Izrael, who is, coincidentally, from Israel.
###211 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###216 HARRY: Joe was a big, quiet, bearded dude who probably
###219 owned more guns than I do shirts.
###220 So I was a little nervous at first and couldn't talk good.
###224 I tried to compliment his weapons.
###225 But I didn't know what to say.
###227 Nice paint job on that one.
###229 JOE: Excuse me?
###229 HARRY: Nice paint job on that--
###231 
###235 [CLEARS THROAT]
###236 JOE: So what we'll do today here is NRA basic shotgun
###240 shooting course.
###241 So we're going to learn how to shoot a shotgun.
###244 And there will be a written exam.
###246 You don't have to be afraid.
###247 HARRY: It turns out shotguns are very, very complicated,
###251 like cars or women.
###252 Joe demonstrated how to hold a gun and told
###254 me stuff about it.
###256 But all I could think about was how cool it
###258 would be to fire it.
###260 At the end of the class, I had to take a test with Joe
###263 standing over me like a heavily armed exam monitor.
###266 But this was the easy part since I'm good at tests,
###269 unlike fighting, shooting, or anything else that would help
###272 me survive in the wild.
###273 JOE: This is yours.
###274 Congratulations.
###275 
###277 HARRY: Certified.
###279 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###281 HARRY: We ventured out onto the range, where we watched a
###284 bunch of guys fire pistols at stuff.
###286 We put on these ridiculous headphones to cancel out the
###288 incredibly loud noises of the guns going off.
###291 And although it was definitely masculine, I had no idea what
###294 I was doing out there.
###295 It didn't seem like Joe had any idea either.
###298 He kept looking at me like I was some kind of weird bird.
###303 JOE: This is what you're shooting at.
###304 HARRY: Wow, OK.
###305 JOE: OK?
###306 HARRY: It looks very small.
###308 JOE: It is.
###309 So grab the gun.
###310 OK, and let's go on station number three.
###313 HARRY: All right.
###313 JOE: You can now close the gun.
###315 HARRY: OK.
###316 JOE: OK.
###317 HARRY: And this would need to be--
###318 JOE: No, no, no, no.
###319 We're not shooting it.
###320 HARRY: OK.
###320 JOE: Just mount the gun, properly as we've learned.
###323 HARRY: Like--
###324 
###327 JOE: You feel comfortable?
###328 HARRY: Uh--
###328 JOE: Don't lie to me.
###329 HARRY: No, no, not really.
###330 JOE: OK.
###330 If it's not comfortable, it's not right.
###332 Relax.
###332 Relax a little.
###333 HARRY: OK, relax.
###334 JOE: You're very tense.
###335 HARRY: I know.
###336 I haven't fired a gun before, so I'm tense.
###339 JOE: So many people use this gun, you couldn't imagine--
###341 HARRY: OK.
###341 JOE: --old retired grandmas, teenagers, little girls, my
###343 seven-year-old daughter.
###346 HARRY: Pull.
###347 
###349 Oops.
###350 Oh, I forgot to cock it.
###352 Pull.
###353 Oops.
###353 [GUN FIRING]
###354 Pull.
###355 [GUN FIRING]
###355 JOE: Good.
###356 HARRY: Pull.
###358 [GUN FIRING]
###358 JOE: Good, good.
###360 HARRY: This is more fun than I thought it would be.
###362 I'm going to get carpal tunnel from this.
###364 No one's going to believe it's from handling a shotgun.
###366 Everyone's going to think it's from jacking off.
###370 JOE: Harry.
###370 HARRY: Oh.
###371 [INAUDIBLE].
###371 JOE: Come stand.
###373 How does this feel?
###375 HARRY: This--
###375 JOE: Huh?
###376 HARRY: Is this a little lighter than the last one?
###377 JOE: No.
###377 If anything, it's heavier.
###378 It's better suited for you.
###379 HARRY: OK.
###380 JOE: OK.
###380 But I have a lot of youngster and old, retired people who
###384 pretty much are more comfortable with the gun.
###386 HARRY: Pull.
###386 [GUN FIRING]
###387 Whoa.
###389 JOE: Blew it off your head?
###390 HARRY: Yeah.
###391 JOE: OK.
###392 HARRY: It's very fast.
###394 JOE: You're way too tense.
###395 You having fun?
###397 You came here to have fun.
###398 HARRY: Is it normal for--
###399 JOE: Huh?
###400 HARRY: Is it normal for first timers?
###401 JOE: I'm not saying it happens to everybody.
###402 There are some people who just come and pick it up, and some
###407 people need more time.
###409 [GUN CLICKING]
###410 HARRY: Oops.
###410 JOE: Oops.
###412 [GUN FIRING]
###413 [GUN FIRING]
###414 HARRY: So shooting a gun is really fun and awesome.
###417 I also learned that shooting small pink things going really
###420 fast is incredibly difficult.
###422 If a small pink thing attacks me at high speed,
###425 I'm probably fucked.
###426 But if a person attacks me, I think I'm going to be a little
###428 more confident because I've got my Krav Maga skills--
###432 that was a punch.
###433 Actually, now that I think about it, if someone attacks
###436 me, I'm probably just going to run away or get beat up.
###441 Yeah.
###442 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###447 JOE: Turn that way.
###448 HARRY: Turn this way?
###450 I don't know how to turn properly without pointing it
###451 [INAUDIBLE].
###452 JOE: Look, just pick it up.
###454 Now you can turn.
###455 HARRY: OK.
###455 Like this?
###457 JOE: No, you can--
###457 HARRY: What?
###458 Oh, like this?
###458 OK.
