0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:2,34



2
0:0:2,34 --> 0:0:3,744
STEVE SPANGLER: Tomorrow's
the day.


3
0:0:3,744 --> 0:0:7,33
We've been working for the last
month on this thing now.


4
0:0:7,33 --> 0:0:8,48
All the practices.


5
0:0:8,48 --> 0:0:10,9
And it's amazing this all
started with a phone call.


6
0:0:10,9 --> 0:0:12,7
Can you do this?


7
0:0:12,7 --> 0:0:13,63
And all these practices.


8
0:0:13,63 --> 0:0:15,0
We've got that giveaway.


9
0:0:15,0 --> 0:0:16,98
So we're going to do the big
wind bags with everybody.


10
0:0:16,98 --> 0:0:19,77
We've got our team that
practiced the huge solar bags.


11
0:0:19,77 --> 0:0:21,43
And they're running
through that.


12
0:0:21,43 --> 0:0:22,8
We practiced in the parking
lot with the


13
0:0:22,8 --> 0:0:24,43
exploding trash cans.


14
0:0:24,43 --> 0:0:25,45
We've got that piece.


15
0:0:25,45 --> 0:0:28,45
I think I've got a good
shot with the potato.


16
0:0:28,45 --> 0:0:29,47
It's all coming together.


17
0:0:29,47 --> 0:0:30,79
So now this is the unknown.


18
0:0:30,79 --> 0:0:33,32
This is what happens when
you put a live audience.


19
0:0:33,32 --> 0:0:34,65
And somebody says go.


20
0:0:34,65 --> 0:0:36,49
And 45 minutes later.


21
0:0:36,49 --> 0:0:38,82
Oh, and by the way, Guinness
World Records showing up.


22
0:0:38,82 --> 0:0:41,51
So an adjudicator from Guinness
World Records said


23
0:0:41,51 --> 0:0:44,26
yes, and so we flew him in,
and so they're here.


24
0:0:44,26 --> 0:0:48,63
And so if we do it, this will be
the world's largest physics


25
0:0:48,63 --> 0:0:49,51
demonstra--


26
0:0:49,51 --> 0:0:53,36
the world's largest
physics lesson.


27
0:0:53,36 --> 0:0:54,13
Let's see how it goes.


28
0:0:54,13 --> 0:0:54,475
Thank you so much
for being here.


29
0:0:54,475 --> 0:0:55,69
I greatly appreciate it.


30
0:0:55,69 --> 0:0:57,335
Thank you so much
for being here.


31
0:0:57,335 --> 0:0:59,58
And being part of
our first annual


32
0:0:59,58 --> 0:1:1,21
Weather and Science Day.


33
0:1:1,21 --> 0:1:2,59
You are going to have a blast.


34
0:1:2,59 --> 0:1:5,33
We've got so many things
scheduled for you.


35
0:1:5,33 --> 0:1:8,14
We know that sitting and
watching a science program is


36
0:1:8,14 --> 0:1:10,625
not as much fun as doing it,
so we may teach you some


37
0:1:10,625 --> 0:1:12,71
things that you can
try later on.


38
0:1:12,71 --> 0:1:14,53
We actually have something that
you're going to do with


39
0:1:14,53 --> 0:1:15,77
us later on as well.


40
0:1:15,77 --> 0:1:18,49
And so I'm going to need your
help in doing that.


41
0:1:18,49 --> 0:1:22,82
We're going to try to attempt
the world's largest physics


42
0:1:22,82 --> 0:1:26,6
demonstration or lesson right
here, at Coors Field.


43
0:1:26,6 --> 0:1:27,62
And we're going to need
everybody that we have here in


44
0:1:27,62 --> 0:1:28,28
the stands.


45
0:1:28,28 --> 0:1:30,13
Well, let's get started because
when we're talking


46
0:1:30,13 --> 0:1:32,24
about weather and science, we've
got to talk a little bit


47
0:1:32,24 --> 0:1:35,9
about what goes on with solids,
liquids and gases in


48
0:1:35,9 --> 0:1:35,89
those things.


49
0:1:35,89 --> 0:1:38,71
And so I thought that it might
be a smart idea to do the very


50
0:1:38,71 --> 0:1:40,446
first experiment you and
I ever did together.


51
0:1:40,446 --> 0:1:40,72
Fair enough?


52
0:1:40,72 --> 0:1:41,725
KATHY SABINE: Oh, let's do it.


53
0:1:41,725 --> 0:1:44,11
STEVE SPANGLER: And we just
happen to have a couple little


54
0:1:44,11 --> 0:1:46,6
ingredients I'm sure you've
never seen before.


55
0:1:46,6 --> 0:1:47,41
These are kinds of things
that you can find


56
0:1:47,41 --> 0:1:48,26
at home, all right?


57
0:1:48,26 --> 0:1:48,64
KATHY SABINE: I don't
get to drink this?


58
0:1:48,64 --> 0:1:49,79
STEVE SPANGLER: Which
is wonderful.


59
0:1:49,79 --> 0:1:50,67
Good job.


60
0:1:50,67 --> 0:1:53,31
Everybody in the stands, you
should have a roll of Mentos


61
0:1:53,31 --> 0:1:54,87
and a test tube, do you?


62
0:1:54,87 --> 0:1:57,12
KATHY SABINE: Everybody got
them, hold them up.


63
0:1:57,12 --> 0:1:57,61
All right.


64
0:1:57,61 --> 0:1:58,815
STEVE SPANGLER: That roll
of Mentos and test


65
0:1:58,815 --> 0:2:0,38
tube is for you later.


66
0:2:0,38 --> 0:2:2,6
But you must start with
me this way, ready?


67
0:2:2,6 --> 0:2:4,785
Say I promise not to
do this at home.


68
0:2:4,785 --> 0:2:7,78
CROWD: I promise not
to do this at home.


69
0:2:7,78 --> 0:2:9,459
STEVE SPANGLER: I will do
it at a friend's home.


70
0:2:9,459 --> 0:2:12,155
KATHY SABINE: Oh!


71
0:2:12,155 --> 0:2:13,12
STEVE SPANGLER: Perfect,
all right?


72
0:2:13,12 --> 0:2:14,305
Here's what we're going to do.


73
0:2:14,305 --> 0:2:16,2
Kathy, If you take
a bottle of soda,


74
0:2:16,2 --> 0:2:16,38
KATHY SABINE: OK.


75
0:2:16,38 --> 0:2:17,49
STEVE SPANGLER: And you shake
up that bottle of soda.


76
0:2:17,49 --> 0:2:17,98
KATHY SABINE: Let
me shake it now.


77
0:2:17,98 --> 0:2:20,37
STEVE SPANGLER: Carbon dioxide,
that gas, will come


78
0:2:20,37 --> 0:2:21,33
out of the soda.


79
0:2:21,33 --> 0:2:22,5
So what we're going to
do is we're going to


80
0:2:22,5 --> 0:2:23,88
help it come out.


81
0:2:23,88 --> 0:2:27,74
This time, we're going to use
these Mentos, all right?


82
0:2:27,74 --> 0:2:30,435
Mentos are amazing because
there's these tiny little pits


83
0:2:30,435 --> 0:2:31,33
that they have.


84
0:2:31,33 --> 0:2:34,1
And so all the carbon dioxide
kind of comes running to it.


85
0:2:34,1 --> 0:2:36,29
The trick here, kids, is what
you have to do, is you're


86
0:2:36,29 --> 0:2:37,82
going to put your fingers
at home--


87
0:2:37,82 --> 0:2:39,11
I mean at a friend's home--


88
0:2:39,11 --> 0:2:41,1
over here, like this.


89
0:2:41,1 --> 0:2:42,87
Don't do it inside either.


90
0:2:42,87 --> 0:2:44,69
That's the other little
problem, all right?


91
0:2:44,69 --> 0:2:47,16
When you drop them all in
it once, the carbon


92
0:2:47,16 --> 0:2:48,35
dioxide will come out.


93
0:2:48,35 --> 0:2:49,27
All right, so are you
ready, Kathy?


94
0:2:49,27 --> 0:2:50,4
KATHY SABINE: I don't know.


95
0:2:50,4 --> 0:2:50,955
STEVE SPANGLER: You and I are
going to hold it together, we


96
0:2:50,955 --> 0:2:51,75
turn it upside down.


97
0:2:51,75 --> 0:2:53,66
Three, two, one drops it.


98
0:2:53,66 --> 0:2:57,74
See, that's why that-- nice.


99
0:2:57,74 --> 0:2:59,166
Nice, that was good,
wasn't it?


100
0:2:59,166 --> 0:3:0,56
KATHY SABINE: Wow, that's
minty fresh.


101
0:3:0,56 --> 0:3:1,5
That's good.


102
0:3:1,5 --> 0:3:1,84
STEVE SPANGLER: Nice.


103
0:3:1,84 --> 0:3:2,75
KATHY SABINE: That's good.


104
0:3:2,75 --> 0:3:4,68
STEVE SPANGLER: But here's
the problem, all right?


105
0:3:4,68 --> 0:3:7,88
The problem is if you just take
Mentos and drop them into


106
0:3:7,88 --> 0:3:10,79
Diet Coke, that's not a science
experiment, that's


107
0:3:10,79 --> 0:3:12,23
just doing something fun.


108
0:3:12,23 --> 0:3:13,79
KATHY SABINE: That's making
a mess, Steve.


109
0:3:13,79 --> 0:3:14,43
STEVE SPANGLER: It
is making a mess.


110
0:3:14,43 --> 0:3:16,74
We need to turn this into a
real science experiment.


111
0:3:16,74 --> 0:3:18,82
In order to do that,
we need to be able


112
0:3:18,82 --> 0:3:20,41
to control a variable.


113
0:3:20,41 --> 0:3:22,7
So I think we're going to be
able to do it if we have a


114
0:3:22,7 --> 0:3:24,14
really good geyser team.


115
0:3:24,14 --> 0:3:26,58
So ladies and gentlemen, from
the dugout, please welcome the


116
0:3:26,58 --> 0:3:28,46
Steve Spangler Science
Geyser Team.


117
0:3:28,46 --> 0:3:29,71
Come on out, guys.


118
0:3:29,71 --> 0:3:33,13



119
0:3:33,13 --> 0:3:36,3
All right guys, this is our
geyser team right here.


120
0:3:36,3 --> 0:3:37,38
These are geyserologists.


121
0:3:37,38 --> 0:3:39,32
They have been practicing
and practicing.


122
0:3:39,32 --> 0:3:42,1
Earlier today our geyserologists
went into the


123
0:3:42,1 --> 0:3:44,67
stands and found 10
lucky people.


124
0:3:44,67 --> 0:3:46,77
If you're one of those 10 lucky
people, you look at the


125
0:3:46,77 --> 0:3:47,91
geyserologists.


126
0:3:47,91 --> 0:3:49,12
They're going to look at you.


127
0:3:49,12 --> 0:3:51,44
Right now, give us a little
music, and go get your kids.


128
0:3:51,44 --> 0:3:52,17
Would you do that for me?


129
0:3:52,17 --> 0:3:52,88
Go get your kids.


130
0:3:52,88 --> 0:3:53,371
Go.


131
0:3:53,371 --> 0:3:58,772
[MUSIC PLAYING]


132
0:3:58,772 --> 0:4:0,245
KATHY SABINE: We've got
to root them on.


133
0:4:0,245 --> 0:4:1,718
We're going to get
them sticky wet.


134
0:4:1,718 --> 0:4:2,88
STEVE SPANGLER: Ladies and
gentlemen, nice round of


135
0:4:2,88 --> 0:4:4,78
applause for our 10 helpers,
would you?


136
0:4:4,78 --> 0:4:5,183
Nice?


137
0:4:5,183 --> 0:4:8,24
All right.


138
0:4:8,24 --> 0:4:10,28
All right, geyser team, it's
really important that we


139
0:4:10,28 --> 0:4:12,56
practice safety, so would you
please put on the safety


140
0:4:12,56 --> 0:4:13,9
glasses, all right?


141
0:4:13,9 --> 0:4:15,712
Put on those safety glasses.


142
0:4:15,712 --> 0:4:18,54
Kids, you adjust those safety
glasses, team go get to the


143
0:4:18,54 --> 0:4:19,279
goodies, all right?


144
0:4:19,279 --> 0:4:20,2
Go get the goodies.


145
0:4:20,2 --> 0:4:22,47
Let me tell you the experiment
that we've set up.


146
0:4:22,47 --> 0:4:24,65
You can only change
one variable.


147
0:4:24,65 --> 0:4:27,7
So this time, Kathy, we're
going to use Diet Coke.


148
0:4:27,7 --> 0:4:27,45
KATHY SABINE: All right.


149
0:4:27,45 --> 0:4:28,1
STEVE SPANGLER: We're not going
to change anything.


150
0:4:28,1 --> 0:4:28,52
KATHY SABINE: I love that.


151
0:4:28,52 --> 0:4:30,5
STEVE SPANGLER: Same temperature
of Diet Coke.


152
0:4:30,5 --> 0:4:31,58
The only thing that we're going
to do is we're going to


153
0:4:31,58 --> 0:4:33,34
change the number of Mentos.


154
0:4:33,34 --> 0:4:35,44
I want you to know the
number that gives


155
0:4:35,44 --> 0:4:37,13
us the highest geyser.


156
0:4:37,13 --> 0:4:40,69
So from left to right, we're
going to do one Mentos, two


157
0:4:40,69 --> 0:4:44,13
Mentos, three Mentos, all
the way up to 10 Mentos.


158
0:4:44,13 --> 0:4:44,33
KATHY SABINE: Great.


159
0:4:44,33 --> 0:4:46,97
STEVE SPANGLER: So if we were to
do a finale, I don't know.


160
0:4:46,97 --> 0:4:49,78
But if we were to do a finale,
you would know the number of


161
0:4:49,78 --> 0:4:53,36
Mentos you should drop in
for the highest geyser.


162
0:4:53,36 --> 0:4:54,26
Fair enough?


163
0:4:54,26 --> 0:4:56,8
All right, kids, your
geyserologist is going to is


164
0:4:56,8 --> 0:4:58,15
going to put on your poncho
for you, all right?


165
0:4:58,15 --> 0:4:59,98
10 ponchos, 10 kids.


166
0:4:59,98 --> 0:5:0,36
KATHY SABINE: Perfect.


167
0:5:0,36 --> 0:5:2,16
STEVE SPANGLER: It's funny how
math kind of works that way.


168
0:5:2,16 --> 0:5:2,95
KATHY SABINE: Yes, it does.


169
0:5:2,95 --> 0:5:4,44
STEVE SPANGLER: It's a little
tube that we have on the top.


170
0:5:4,44 --> 0:5:6,59
It's the geyser tube that's
just holding it in place.


171
0:5:6,59 --> 0:5:8,61
So when we pull, we'll
pull the first one.


172
0:5:8,61 --> 0:5:10,55
We'll get a chance to be able
to see what that looks like.


173
0:5:10,55 --> 0:5:11,54
Then the second one.


174
0:5:11,54 --> 0:5:12,23
Then the third one.


175
0:5:12,23 --> 0:5:12,92
All right?


176
0:5:12,92 --> 0:5:15,75
Kids, put your hands over
the top of the bottles.


177
0:5:15,75 --> 0:5:16,85
All right?


178
0:5:16,85 --> 0:5:19,58
They're pulling the pin
here in just a second.


179
0:5:19,58 --> 0:5:20,76
Let's do the very first one.


180
0:5:20,76 --> 0:5:21,73
Are you ready, Zara?


181
0:5:21,73 --> 0:5:23,54
Three, two, one.


182
0:5:23,54 --> 0:5:24,79
Pull it.


183
0:5:24,79 --> 0:5:28,183



184
0:5:28,183 --> 0:5:32,54
All right, so one Mentos is
OK, but a little boring on


185
0:5:32,54 --> 0:5:33,822
Science Day.


186
0:5:33,822 --> 0:5:35,64
Two Mentos, go.


187
0:5:35,64 --> 0:5:37,87
KATHY SABINE: Aw, Steve,
that could be the one.


188
0:5:37,87 --> 0:5:38,43
STEVE SPANGLER: That's good.


189
0:5:38,43 --> 0:5:38,97
KATHY SABINE: Two
is looking good.


190
0:5:38,97 --> 0:5:39,925
STEVE SPANGLER: Three
Mentos, go!


191
0:5:39,925 --> 0:5:41,29
KATHY SABINE: No, it's
got to be two.


192
0:5:41,29 --> 0:5:41,952
Whoa!


193
0:5:41,952 --> 0:5:42,364
STEVE SPANGLER: Nice.


194
0:5:42,364 --> 0:5:43,6
I see a pattern here.


195
0:5:43,6 --> 0:5:44,29
KATHY SABINE: Three is better.


196
0:5:44,29 --> 0:5:45,6
STEVE SPANGLER: Four Mentos.


197
0:5:45,6 --> 0:5:45,79
KATHY SABINE: Let's
go with four.


198
0:5:45,79 --> 0:5:46,66
STEVE SPANGLER: Try four.


199
0:5:46,66 --> 0:5:48,27
Nice.


200
0:5:48,27 --> 0:5:49,8
Five Mentos.


201
0:5:49,8 --> 0:5:49,84
Good job.


202
0:5:49,84 --> 0:5:51,3
KATHY SABINE: Whoa!


203
0:5:51,3 --> 0:5:52,8
STEVE SPANGLER: Now
six Mentos.


204
0:5:52,8 --> 0:5:53,62
Give me a six.


205
0:5:53,62 --> 0:5:55,345
KATHY SABINE: Woo!


206
0:5:55,345 --> 0:5:57,402
STEVE SPANGLER: Are you kind
of seeing what I'm seeing?


207
0:5:57,402 --> 0:5:58,85
We're kind of hitting
a plateau here.


208
0:5:58,85 --> 0:6:0,67
Seven Mentos.


209
0:6:0,67 --> 0:6:1,93
Nice!


210
0:6:1,93 --> 0:6:4,38
We just hit a magic number.


211
0:6:4,38 --> 0:6:5,62
Eight Mentos--


212
0:6:5,62 --> 0:6:6,66
nice!


213
0:6:6,66 --> 0:6:8,57
KATHY SABINE: Woo!


214
0:6:8,57 --> 0:6:10,385
STEVE SPANGLER: Nine Mentos.


215
0:6:10,385 --> 0:6:11,83
Nice!


216
0:6:11,83 --> 0:6:13,1
Give me a 10, would ya?


217
0:6:13,1 --> 0:6:14,19
KATHY SABINE: Go Jack!


218
0:6:14,19 --> 0:6:14,647
STEVE SPANGLER: Nice!


219
0:6:14,647 --> 0:6:15,897
KATHY SABINE: Whoa!


220
0:6:15,897 --> 0:6:18,16



221
0:6:18,16 --> 0:6:19,47
STEVE SPANGLER: If you were
going to do it, and you were


222
0:6:19,47 --> 0:6:20,78
actually going to use
a bottle, how many


223
0:6:20,78 --> 0:6:22,315
Mentos would you use?


224
0:6:22,315 --> 0:6:23,5
AUDIENCE: 10!


225
0:6:23,5 --> 0:6:25,24
STEVE SPANGLER: All right
guys, go get 'em,


226
0:6:25,24 --> 0:6:26,89
let's do 10, all right?


227
0:6:26,89 --> 0:6:29,29
Now the hard part here is our
geyser team has to get


228
0:6:29,29 --> 0:6:30,41
everything ready.


229
0:6:30,41 --> 0:6:33,14
So they have to unroll it, and
then we have to have a team


230
0:6:33,14 --> 0:6:34,8
together so we can pull
all at the same time.


231
0:6:34,8 --> 0:6:36,38
KATHY SABINE: So everybody
has 10, Steve?


232
0:6:36,38 --> 0:6:37,52
STEVE SPANGLER: Is
everybody ready?


233
0:6:37,52 --> 0:6:39,16
Let's count 'em down from five.


234
0:6:39,16 --> 0:6:39,93
Ready?


235
0:6:39,93 --> 0:6:44,4
ALL: Five, four, three,
two, one.


236
0:6:44,4 --> 0:6:45,325
STEVE SPANGLER: Give
them a pull now.


237
0:6:45,325 --> 0:6:46,275
Nice job!


238
0:6:46,275 --> 0:6:47,525
KATHY SABINE: Wooo!


239
0:6:47,525 --> 0:6:50,335



240
0:6:50,335 --> 0:6:52,1
STEVE SPANGLER: Well, I guess
those seats aren't so good


241
0:6:52,1 --> 0:6:53,879
after all, are they?


242
0:6:53,879 --> 0:6:54,825
KATHY SABINE: Yes!


243
0:6:54,825 --> 0:6:56,7
STEVE SPANGLER: Ladies and
gentlemen, let's hear it for


244
0:6:56,7 --> 0:6:57,19
our geyser team.


245
0:6:57,19 --> 0:6:57,663
KATHY SABINE: Yes!


246
0:6:57,663 --> 0:7:0,51
And how about those
volunteers?


247
0:7:0,51 --> 0:7:2,81
STEVE SPANGLER: So Kathy, I told
you you'd have to do a


248
0:7:2,81 --> 0:7:3,65
couple little demos.


249
0:7:3,65 --> 0:7:5,25
So I'm going to ask
you to blow up a


250
0:7:5,25 --> 0:7:6,21
balloon in front of everybody.


251
0:7:6,21 --> 0:7:6,62
KATHY SABINE: OK.


252
0:7:6,62 --> 0:7:8,37
Are you saying I'm full
of hot air, Steve?


253
0:7:8,37 --> 0:7:8,715
STEVE SPANGLER: No, I'm just
saying you're going


254
0:7:8,715 --> 0:7:9,42
to blow up a balloon.


255
0:7:9,42 --> 0:7:10,24
It's just fine.


256
0:7:10,24 --> 0:7:10,71
KATHY SABINE: All right.


257
0:7:10,71 --> 0:7:12,57
STEVE SPANGLER: But if I have
you blow up a balloon, I don't


258
0:7:12,57 --> 0:7:15,21
really know where to
get you to stop.


259
0:7:15,21 --> 0:7:15,88
You know what I mean?


260
0:7:15,88 --> 0:7:17,75
How many breaths does it take
to blow up the balloon?


261
0:7:17,75 --> 0:7:19,31
It could be this many,
could be this many.


262
0:7:19,31 --> 0:7:19,61
KATHY SABINE: OK.


263
0:7:19,61 --> 0:7:21,23
STEVE SPANGLER: So here's what
I have for you, right here.


264
0:7:21,23 --> 0:7:21,86
Watch this.


265
0:7:21,86 --> 0:7:22,13
KATHY SABINE: Great.


266
0:7:22,13 --> 0:7:23,62
STEVE SPANGLER: This is a little
different balloon.


267
0:7:23,62 --> 0:7:28,6
It's eight feet long, it's 10
inches around, and it holds 45


268
0:7:28,6 --> 0:7:29,8
liters of air.


269
0:7:29,8 --> 0:7:29,62
Blow into the bag.


270
0:7:29,62 --> 0:7:30,4
Ready?


271
0:7:30,4 --> 0:7:30,29
KATHY SABINE: Ok.


272
0:7:30,29 --> 0:7:30,56
Ready?


273
0:7:30,56 --> 0:7:33,15
STEVE SPANGLER: Go.


274
0:7:33,15 --> 0:7:35,15
Now this is the problem, people,
because this takes


275
0:7:35,15 --> 0:7:36,41
about 32 minutes.


276
0:7:36,41 --> 0:7:40,4
So, don't worry,
it'll be fine.


277
0:7:40,4 --> 0:7:41,66
Kathy, look at this.


278
0:7:41,66 --> 0:7:41,95
Watch this.


279
0:7:41,95 --> 0:7:45,11
If we slide it down like this,
it comes out this big old hole


280
0:7:45,11 --> 0:7:45,86
down over here.


281
0:7:45,86 --> 0:7:49,3
So that, tiny little problem.


282
0:7:49,3 --> 0:7:50,91
I got so excited, I forgot
about that part.


283
0:7:50,91 --> 0:7:51,41
KATHY SABINE: Me, too.


284
0:7:51,41 --> 0:7:51,93
STEVE SPANGLER: Just give
me three breaths.


285
0:7:51,93 --> 0:7:52,57
Would you do that?


286
0:7:52,57 --> 0:7:53,44
Three breaths.


287
0:7:53,44 --> 0:7:55,68
KATHY SABINE: All right.


288
0:7:55,68 --> 0:7:57,73
STEVE SPANGLER: Nice,
there's one.


289
0:7:57,73 --> 0:7:58,6
There's--


290
0:7:58,6 --> 0:8:0,49
I didn't tell you it'd be a hot
day and you'd be breathing


291
0:8:0,49 --> 0:8:2,53
into a stupid bag.


292
0:8:2,53 --> 0:8:3,245
There's three.


293
0:8:3,245 --> 0:8:3,65
KATHY SABINE: Is that enough?


294
0:8:3,65 --> 0:8:4,87
STEVE SPANGLER: Look at this.


295
0:8:4,87 --> 0:8:5,47
Now--


296
0:8:5,47 --> 0:8:7,2
Look at little miss
athlete over here.


297
0:8:7,2 --> 0:8:8,7
Three breaths of air, people.


298
0:8:8,7 --> 0:8:9,81
It's not bad.


299
0:8:9,81 --> 0:8:11,47
KATHY SABINE: And no lipstick
left at all.


300
0:8:11,47 --> 0:8:13,19
STEVE SPANGLER: I think you
could do the whole bag in


301
0:8:13,19 --> 0:8:15,19
probably 10 breaths of air.


302
0:8:15,19 --> 0:8:16,985
But I want to show you
another way to do it.


303
0:8:16,985 --> 0:8:18,5
KATHY SABINE: Yeah, could you?


304
0:8:18,5 --> 0:8:19,3
STEVE SPANGLER: Another
way to do it.


305
0:8:19,3 --> 0:8:21,13
Maybe a different way to do
it would be to do this.


306
0:8:21,13 --> 0:8:24,4
If we could actually use the
air around us to help blow


307
0:8:24,4 --> 0:8:26,28
into the bag, it would
be extremely helpful.


308
0:8:26,28 --> 0:8:27,46
KATHY SABINE: You're going
to let my air out.


309
0:8:27,46 --> 0:8:29,38
I worked hard for that.


310
0:8:29,38 --> 0:8:30,6
STEVE SPANGLER: That's OK.


311
0:8:30,6 --> 0:8:30,66
It's all right.


312
0:8:30,66 --> 0:8:31,555
I'll show you the secret.


313
0:8:31,555 --> 0:8:34,72
It's all about the shower
curtain in the morning that


314
0:8:34,72 --> 0:8:37,63
attacks you every
single morning.


315
0:8:37,63 --> 0:8:40,39
When you turn on that shower
and the water comes rushing


316
0:8:40,39 --> 0:8:42,48
down, that silly shower
curtain starts


317
0:8:42,48 --> 0:8:43,59
to move in on you.


318
0:8:43,59 --> 0:8:45,77
When it does, it's Bernoulli's
principle.


319
0:8:45,77 --> 0:8:48,89
It says fast-moving
air will create


320
0:8:48,89 --> 0:8:50,4
this area of low pressure.


321
0:8:50,4 --> 0:8:52,27
So if you just hold
from far away.


322
0:8:52,27 --> 0:8:53,71
KATHY SABINE: Yeah, I'll
do the holding.


323
0:8:53,71 --> 0:8:54,59
STEVE SPANGLER: Watch what's
going to happen.


324
0:8:54,59 --> 0:8:57,2
If you and I hold like this--
and in just a second, when you


325
0:8:57,2 --> 0:8:59,68
try, you're going to open
up the bag like this.


326
0:8:59,68 --> 0:9:3,64
And then a long stream of air
into the bag, but stand back.


327
0:9:3,64 --> 0:9:5,955
Watch what happens.


328
0:9:5,955 --> 0:9:7,372
See how fast?


329
0:9:7,372 --> 0:9:8,91
KATHY SABINE: You made
that look so easy.


330
0:9:8,91 --> 0:9:10,63
STEVE SPANGLER: Single breath
of air, but you


331
0:9:10,63 --> 0:9:12,41
have to stand back.


332
0:9:12,41 --> 0:9:13,79
Turn to the person
next to you and


333
0:9:13,79 --> 0:9:15,65
say, Bernoulli's principle.


334
0:9:15,65 --> 0:9:17,67
Tell 'em, right now.


335
0:9:17,67 --> 0:9:18,29
KATHY SABINE: We're not
going to ask them to


336
0:9:18,29 --> 0:9:18,85
spell it, are we?


337
0:9:18,85 --> 0:9:20,86
STEVE SPANGLER: In just a
second, we're going to stand


338
0:9:20,86 --> 0:9:24,63
up, and you are going to
have two minutes to


339
0:9:24,63 --> 0:9:27,94
inflate 7,000 wind bags.


340
0:9:27,94 --> 0:9:28,84
KATHY SABINE: Are you
up to the challenge?


341
0:9:28,84 --> 0:9:30,45
STEVE SPANGLER: And our good
friends over here from Sky


342
0:9:30,45 --> 0:9:33,77
Nine are going to circle right
in and take a look at us.


343
0:9:33,77 --> 0:9:34,67
Stand up everybody.


344
0:9:34,67 --> 0:9:35,832
KATHY SABINE: Stand
up everybody!


345
0:9:35,832 --> 0:9:37,14
STEVE SPANGLER: Roll
the bags out.


346
0:9:37,14 --> 0:9:37,56
Ready?


347
0:9:37,56 --> 0:9:38,7
Go for it.


348
0:9:38,7 --> 0:9:39,36
Roll those bags out.


349
0:9:39,36 --> 0:9:43,1
Tie off one end, all
right, people.


350
0:9:43,1 --> 0:9:44,37
Give us a little bump music.


351
0:9:44,37 --> 0:9:45,23
Would you do that for us?


352
0:9:45,23 --> 0:9:46,33
A little high energy--


353
0:9:46,33 --> 0:9:48,85
something that would be fun
to inflate some bags by.


354
0:9:48,85 --> 0:9:49,303
Fair enough?


355
0:9:49,303 --> 0:9:49,393
[MUSIC--


356
0:9:49,393 --> 0:9:50,643
REPUBLICA, "READY TO GO"]


357
0:9:50,643 --> 0:9:52,93



358
0:9:52,93 --> 0:9:53,51
STEVE SPANGLER: All right,
tie off one end--


359
0:9:53,51 --> 0:9:54,916
KATHY SABINE: Boy, they've
got it up there.


360
0:9:54,916 --> 0:9:56,9
Steve, look at those
kids in the back.


361
0:9:56,9 --> 0:9:56,625
They've got it.


362
0:9:56,625 --> 0:9:57,28
STEVE SPANGLER: Nice job.


363
0:9:57,28 --> 0:9:58,13
KATHY SABINE: Nice
job back there.


364
0:9:58,13 --> 0:10:0,3
STEVE SPANGLER: Find somebody
a couple rows back from you


365
0:10:0,3 --> 0:10:3,333
who will hold on to the bag
maybe, so that you can try to


366
0:10:3,333 --> 0:10:5,59
inflate it with a single
breath of air.


367
0:10:5,59 --> 0:10:7,6
Oh, you're looking good.


368
0:10:7,6 --> 0:10:10,35
I'll know you're done
when you hold it up.


369
0:10:10,35 --> 0:10:11,83
Nice job.


370
0:10:11,83 --> 0:10:12,85
KATHY SABINE: Woo!


371
0:10:12,85 --> 0:10:13,26
STEVE SPANGLER: Ladies
and gentlemen, look


372
0:10:13,26 --> 0:10:14,21
at this around you.


373
0:10:14,21 --> 0:10:15,5
You're halfway there.


374
0:10:15,5 --> 0:10:16,33
All right?


375
0:10:16,33 --> 0:10:19,67
You're halfway there.


376
0:10:19,67 --> 0:10:22,74
We have a minute and
10 seconds to go.


377
0:10:22,74 --> 0:10:24,55
A minute and 10 seconds.


378
0:10:24,55 --> 0:10:27,8
Help the people around you.


379
0:10:27,8 --> 0:10:31,7
Daniel Bernoulli would
be very proud of you.


380
0:10:31,7 --> 0:10:33,415
He's just not here right now.


381
0:10:33,415 --> 0:10:36,5



382
0:10:36,5 --> 0:10:39,32
Gosh, that looks good.


383
0:10:39,32 --> 0:10:40,333
Isn't that fun?


384
0:10:40,333 --> 0:10:40,736
KATHY SABINE: It's so fun!


385
0:10:40,736 --> 0:10:41,69
STEVE SPANGLER: I told you
that would be fun.


386
0:10:41,69 --> 0:10:45,675
A little Bernoulli's principle
never hurt anybody.


387
0:10:45,675 --> 0:10:46,645
Here we go.


388
0:10:46,645 --> 0:10:47,615
We're at 30 seconds.


389
0:10:47,615 --> 0:10:49,7
Help the people around you.


390
0:10:49,7 --> 0:10:52,465
Help the people around you.


391
0:10:52,465 --> 0:10:53,435
KATHY SABINE: You've got it.


392
0:10:53,435 --> 0:10:59,37
STEVE SPANGLER: Over 7,000 bags
in less than two minutes.


393
0:10:59,37 --> 0:11:0,64
We're at our countdown.


394
0:11:0,64 --> 0:11:3,67
15, 14, 13, 12,


395
0:11:3,67 --> 0:11:14,844
KATHY SABINE: 11, 10, 9,
8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.


396
0:11:14,844 --> 0:11:16,215
STEVE SPANGLER: Let's
hear it, people.


397
0:11:16,215 --> 0:11:16,672
You got it.


398
0:11:16,672 --> 0:11:17,48
Look at this.


399
0:11:17,48 --> 0:11:18,62
KATHY SABINE: Woo!


400
0:11:18,62 --> 0:11:19,87
STEVE SPANGLER: Nice job.


401
0:11:19,87 --> 0:11:23,22



402
0:11:23,22 --> 0:11:26,88
That's over 7,000 bags
in under two minutes.


403
0:11:26,88 --> 0:11:27,845
That's absolutely amazing.


404
0:11:27,845 --> 0:11:29,23
KATHY SABINE: That is
amazing, Steve.


405
0:11:29,23 --> 0:11:30,51
STEVE SPANGLER: Isn't
that fun?


406
0:11:30,51 --> 0:11:33,76
Congratulations for paying
attention and allowing us to


407
0:11:33,76 --> 0:11:34,81
be able to do that.


408
0:11:34,81 --> 0:11:35,63
Take the air down.


409
0:11:35,63 --> 0:11:37,3
Teachers, help us out.


410
0:11:37,3 --> 0:11:40,1
Let me direct your attention
to the field right now, and


411
0:11:40,1 --> 0:11:42,93
watch what's going to
happen on the field.


412
0:11:42,93 --> 0:11:45,98
Our 9News Spangler Science
Team is out on


413
0:11:45,98 --> 0:11:47,23
the field right now.


414
0:11:47,23 --> 0:11:54,14
But they have wind bags that are
50 feet long and hold 350


415
0:11:54,14 --> 0:11:55,27
cubic feet of air.


416
0:11:55,27 --> 0:11:59,12
And the only thing that's
powering them is the sun.


417
0:11:59,12 --> 0:12:2,32
So the hot sun is heating
the air in the bag.


418
0:12:2,32 --> 0:12:3,88
And now, watch what we've got.


419
0:12:3,88 --> 0:12:8,43
We literally have floating
solar sausages out here.


420
0:12:8,43 --> 0:12:11,11
So that you can kind of
see on Coors Field--


421
0:12:11,11 --> 0:12:12,55
I don't think that these
have ever been


422
0:12:12,55 --> 0:12:13,69
on Coors Field before.


423
0:12:13,69 --> 0:12:14,38
KATHY SABINE: I'm
pretty sure not.


424
0:12:14,38 --> 0:12:15,625
STEVE SPANGLER: Isn't
that nice?


425
0:12:15,625 --> 0:12:16,33
Nice job.


426
0:12:16,33 --> 0:12:17,19
Throw them up in
the air, guys.


427
0:12:17,19 --> 0:12:20,29
Let's see if anything happens.


428
0:12:20,29 --> 0:12:23,3
Now, Kathy, we have to be very
careful because, if you're a


429
0:12:23,3 --> 0:12:26,77
teacher in the audience, and you
try this experiment, you


430
0:12:26,77 --> 0:12:28,63
can't let go of the bag.


431
0:12:28,63 --> 0:12:31,97
Because if you let go of the
bag, the FAA will think that


432
0:12:31,97 --> 0:12:33,5
it's a fighter jet--


433
0:12:33,5 --> 0:12:34,88
KATHY SABINE: And they'll
call Steve, and


434
0:12:34,88 --> 0:12:35,36
he gets in big trouble.


435
0:12:35,36 --> 0:12:36,48
STEVE SPANGLER: And then we're
in trouble, all right?


436
0:12:36,48 --> 0:12:39,42
Then once again, we have
to go through legal.


437
0:12:39,42 --> 0:12:41,4
We don't want to
do that again.


438
0:12:41,4 --> 0:12:42,7
KATHY SABINE: And your people
don't want to go


439
0:12:42,7 --> 0:12:42,61
through that again.


440
0:12:42,61 --> 0:12:43,33
STEVE SPANGLER: Look at this!


441
0:12:43,33 --> 0:12:45,85
They're actually using the
bag as a kite, ladies and


442
0:12:45,85 --> 0:12:48,18
gentlemen, holding onto
it with a string.


443
0:12:48,18 --> 0:12:51,26
So you can see it floating
there, using only the


444
0:12:51,26 --> 0:12:52,77
power of the sun.


445
0:12:52,77 --> 0:12:55,68
So that hot air rises, and
you're able to see what it


446
0:12:55,68 --> 0:12:58,3
looks like there with
those solar bags.


447
0:12:58,3 --> 0:13:0,61
We're going to let them play
out there for a second, but


448
0:13:0,61 --> 0:13:1,39
would you do me a favor?


449
0:13:1,39 --> 0:13:4,17
Would you give them a nice big
round of applause right now?


450
0:13:4,17 --> 0:13:5,42
Nice job, guys.


451
0:13:5,42 --> 0:13:8,51



452
0:13:8,51 --> 0:13:10,85
Mr. Announcer, would you let
us know who's coming out of


453
0:13:10,85 --> 0:13:12,64
the dugout?


454
0:13:12,64 --> 0:13:13,796
Ladies and gentlemen--


455
0:13:13,796 --> 0:13:14,692
KATHY SABINE: Hey,
you guys, look!


456
0:13:14,692 --> 0:13:16,49
It's Jeff Francis.


457
0:13:16,49 --> 0:13:19,75
[INAUDIBLE], yeah!


458
0:13:19,75 --> 0:13:22,228
STEVE SPANGLER: Ladies and
gentlemen, Jeff Francis.


459
0:13:22,228 --> 0:13:22,56
Hi, buddy.


460
0:13:22,56 --> 0:13:23,224
How are you?


461
0:13:23,224 --> 0:13:25,22
KATHY SABINE: Nice
to see you again.


462
0:13:25,22 --> 0:13:26,0
STEVE SPANGLER: So,
Jeff, here's what


463
0:13:26,0 --> 0:13:28,7
we've come up with.


464
0:13:28,7 --> 0:13:33,61
Instead of a baseball, I've
got a potato and a straw.


465
0:13:33,61 --> 0:13:36,33
So that's all I've got, is
a potato and a straw.


466
0:13:36,33 --> 0:13:37,65
So, come here, watch this.


467
0:13:37,65 --> 0:13:40,3
So I'm taking my straw
and carving out a


468
0:13:40,3 --> 0:13:41,9
little piece of potato.


469
0:13:41,9 --> 0:13:43,47
Kathy, remember doing this
in the news room?


470
0:13:43,47 --> 0:13:44,44
KATHY SABINE: Oh, yes I do.


471
0:13:44,44 --> 0:13:46,28
STEVE SPANGLER: So now, we're
going to push this little


472
0:13:46,28 --> 0:13:48,12
piece of potato down here.


473
0:13:48,12 --> 0:13:50,84
And using a little--


474
0:13:50,84 --> 0:13:51,17
nice.


475
0:13:51,17 --> 0:13:52,26
Got that?


476
0:13:52,26 --> 0:13:54,3
So, Jeff, take a look at this.


477
0:13:54,3 --> 0:13:57,55
A piece of potato here, and a
piece of potato here, and air


478
0:13:57,55 --> 0:13:58,4
right here.


479
0:13:58,4 --> 0:14:2,442
So if we were to compress the
air, we might be able to shoot


480
0:14:2,442 --> 0:14:4,52
this little potato out
into the stands.


481
0:14:4,52 --> 0:14:5,68
So I'll show you what
it looks like.


482
0:14:5,68 --> 0:14:6,19
Ready?


483
0:14:6,19 --> 0:14:7,38
So I've got it here,
like this.


484
0:14:7,38 --> 0:14:10,4
And we just compress, and
now watch what happens.


485
0:14:10,4 --> 0:14:10,88
KATHY SABINE: Whoa!


486
0:14:10,88 --> 0:14:12,8
STEVE SPANGLER: Not bad.


487
0:14:12,8 --> 0:14:15,28
But that's not Colorado
Rockies style, is it?


488
0:14:15,28 --> 0:14:16,22
JEFF FRANCIS: No, it's not.


489
0:14:16,22 --> 0:14:17,9
STEVE SPANGLER: It's kind
of boring, isn't it?


490
0:14:17,9 --> 0:14:18,76
I'm glad you agreed
so quickly.


491
0:14:18,76 --> 0:14:20,524
KATHY SABINE: Although, Steve,
that was pretty good.


492
0:14:20,524 --> 0:14:21,83
STEVE SPANGLER: But
it was good.


493
0:14:21,83 --> 0:14:23,11
Jeff would you bring on--


494
0:14:23,11 --> 0:14:26,9
and Carly and Renee, go ahead
bring some of these on.


495
0:14:26,9 --> 0:14:28,76
Jeff, these are giant
potato launchers.


496
0:14:28,76 --> 0:14:31,1



497
0:14:31,1 --> 0:14:33,66
I don't know of any other way to
be able to do this besides


498
0:14:33,66 --> 0:14:34,83
at Coor's Field.


499
0:14:34,83 --> 0:14:37,54
So, come on, Carly,
help us out.


500
0:14:37,54 --> 0:14:40,54
All right, so this is our
giant potato launcher.


501
0:14:40,54 --> 0:14:43,635
So here's the deal, you push
the button, the piece of


502
0:14:43,635 --> 0:14:45,65
potato comes out here.


503
0:14:45,65 --> 0:14:45,88
KATHY SABINE: Should
I give it to him?


504
0:14:45,88 --> 0:14:48,462
STEVE SPANGLER: If I were you,
I'd fire it out there and see


505
0:14:48,462 --> 0:14:49,57
if he can catch it.


506
0:14:49,57 --> 0:14:49,77
JEFF FRANCIS: OK.


507
0:14:49,77 --> 0:14:50,61
STEVE SPANGLER: Fair enough?


508
0:14:50,61 --> 0:14:51,3
JEFF FRANCIS: Yeah.


509
0:14:51,3 --> 0:14:54,32
STEVE SPANGLER: So I'm going to
let you hang on here, and


510
0:14:54,32 --> 0:14:57,43
when you're ready to go, I just
hit the button, and see


511
0:14:57,43 --> 0:14:57,85
if it fires.


512
0:14:57,85 --> 0:14:58,25
Ready?


513
0:14:58,25 --> 0:15:2,218
[DRUMROLL]


514
0:15:2,218 --> 0:15:4,7
KATHY SABINE: Whoa, nice!


515
0:15:4,7 --> 0:15:5,105
STEVE SPANGLER: Come on.


516
0:15:5,105 --> 0:15:5,66
Catch it.


517
0:15:5,66 --> 0:15:7,622
Catch it.


518
0:15:7,622 --> 0:15:8,872
Yeah!


519
0:15:8,872 --> 0:15:11,478



520
0:15:11,478 --> 0:15:12,38
We have one more.


521
0:15:12,38 --> 0:15:14,39
It's a little bigger, Jeff.


522
0:15:14,39 --> 0:15:16,75
JEFF FRANCIS: I can't even
throw a ball that far.


523
0:15:16,75 --> 0:15:18,64
STEVE SPANGLER: This one's
just a little bit bigger.


524
0:15:18,64 --> 0:15:20,515
Just because I thought
that 10 Mentos would


525
0:15:20,515 --> 0:15:21,815
be better than one.


526
0:15:21,815 --> 0:15:22,12
Ready?


527
0:15:22,12 --> 0:15:22,602
Go for it.


528
0:15:22,602 --> 0:15:24,53
KATHY SABINE: Maybe I'll just
move out of the way.


529
0:15:24,53 --> 0:15:25,12
Whoa!


530
0:15:25,12 --> 0:15:28,868
[DRUMROLL]


531
0:15:28,868 --> 0:15:30,314
STEVE SPANGLER: Home
run, people!


532
0:15:30,314 --> 0:15:33,784



533
0:15:33,784 --> 0:15:36,17
Ladies and gentlemen, let's
hear it for Jeff Francis!


534
0:15:36,17 --> 0:15:36,8
KATHY SABINE: Yeah!


535
0:15:36,8 --> 0:15:37,213
STEVE SPANGLER: Thanks, buddy.


536
0:15:37,213 --> 0:15:39,71
Thank you very much.


537
0:15:39,71 --> 0:15:40,32
No problem.


538
0:15:40,32 --> 0:15:43,18
On injured reserve, anytime
you want to practice your


539
0:15:43,18 --> 0:15:45,99
pitching, let us know, and
we'll help you out.


540
0:15:45,99 --> 0:15:46,14
KATHY SABINE: Thanks, Jeff.


541
0:15:46,14 --> 0:15:47,58
STEVE SPANGLER: Once again,
people, nice round of applause


542
0:15:47,58 --> 0:15:50,37
for our Colorado Rockies.


543
0:15:50,37 --> 0:15:55,72
Part of our Guinness World
Record is the largest physics


544
0:15:55,72 --> 0:15:59,6
lesson over a 30-minute
period of time.


545
0:15:59,6 --> 0:16:1,11
And so that means we've got
to at least incorporate a


546
0:16:1,11 --> 0:16:2,88
test of some kind.


547
0:16:2,88 --> 0:16:5,31
So if our nice people who are
controlling our video board


548
0:16:5,31 --> 0:16:7,8
will show us what the test looks
like, it'll be right


549
0:16:7,8 --> 0:16:8,54
behind you.


550
0:16:8,54 --> 0:16:10,8
Take a look at this.


551
0:16:10,8 --> 0:16:13,92
KATHY SABINE: Which element
makes up most of the air that


552
0:16:13,92 --> 0:16:15,752
we breathe?


553
0:16:15,752 --> 0:16:17,68
STEVE SPANGLER: Are you
ready for this?


554
0:16:17,68 --> 0:16:23,74
So the answer is, C. Most
of the air that


555
0:16:23,74 --> 0:16:24,85
you breathe is nitrogen.


556
0:16:24,85 --> 0:16:27,31
So, we have this little
demonstration we want to do


557
0:16:27,31 --> 0:16:28,3
right here, Kathy.


558
0:16:28,3 --> 0:16:30,66
KATHY SABINE: Little
demonstration, Steve?


559
0:16:30,66 --> 0:16:32,17
He never does anything little.


560
0:16:32,17 --> 0:16:33,61
STEVE SPANGLER: We've never
done this before, so--


561
0:16:33,61 --> 0:16:35,8
I mean with you, anyway.


562
0:16:35,8 --> 0:16:37,7
I practiced one time
with a friend.


563
0:16:37,7 --> 0:16:39,84
And, honestly, the ambulance
showed up really


564
0:16:39,84 --> 0:16:41,88
fast, so it's fine.


565
0:16:41,88 --> 0:16:43,72
Do you have the goodies
for us?


566
0:16:43,72 --> 0:16:45,65
We've got a lot of stuff that we
have to bring out here, so


567
0:16:45,65 --> 0:16:47,46
take a look at this.


568
0:16:47,46 --> 0:16:48,19
KATHY SABINE: Oh, Steve,
I don't have to


569
0:16:48,19 --> 0:16:49,25
get in that, do I?


570
0:16:49,25 --> 0:16:50,14
STEVE SPANGLER: No,
no, no, no, no.


571
0:16:50,14 --> 0:16:51,86
Thank you, Harmony,
I appreciate it.


572
0:16:51,86 --> 0:16:52,59
Good job.


573
0:16:52,59 --> 0:16:54,525
We've got some hot water
that's over here.


574
0:16:54,525 --> 0:16:54,91
KATHY SABINE: Cold water
would be nice.


575
0:16:54,91 --> 0:16:56,68
STEVE SPANGLER: Which is
probably pretty good.


576
0:16:56,68 --> 0:16:58,98
Kathy, see your boots from
the 9News weather center?


577
0:16:58,98 --> 0:16:59,28
KATHY SABINE: Uh-oh.


578
0:16:59,28 --> 0:17:1,67
When Steve has me put on
my wellies, something


579
0:17:1,67 --> 0:17:2,83
bad's going to happen.


580
0:17:2,83 --> 0:17:4,49
STEVE SPANGLER: I would take
off those sandals--


581
0:17:4,49 --> 0:17:8,17
although they're very nice-- and
I'd stick on those boots.


582
0:17:8,17 --> 0:17:10,349
We have a very scientific
instrument for you.


583
0:17:10,349 --> 0:17:11,6
It's called a bag.


584
0:17:11,6 --> 0:17:12,92
KATHY SABINE: It looks
like a body bag.


585
0:17:12,92 --> 0:17:14,2
STEVE SPANGLER: It's a poncho.


586
0:17:14,2 --> 0:17:14,89
Put on your poncho.


587
0:17:14,89 --> 0:17:16,27
I'll help you.


588
0:17:16,27 --> 0:17:20,96



589
0:17:20,96 --> 0:17:21,429
Good.


590
0:17:21,429 --> 0:17:22,367
Got it?


591
0:17:22,367 --> 0:17:23,109
KATHY SABINE: I don't know.


592
0:17:23,109 --> 0:17:23,859
Do I got it?


593
0:17:23,859 --> 0:17:24,609
STEVE SPANGLER: You're fine.


594
0:17:24,609 --> 0:17:27,94
Inside the trash can, we now are
going to put some of that


595
0:17:27,94 --> 0:17:28,589
liquid nitrogen.


596
0:17:28,589 --> 0:17:31,56
So I have Brian on this side
and Jeff on this side, and


597
0:17:31,56 --> 0:17:33,255
what I'm going to have
them do is to pour


598
0:17:33,255 --> 0:17:34,75
in the liquid nitrogen.


599
0:17:34,75 --> 0:17:37,3
If you take the air that we
breathe, and you compress it,


600
0:17:37,3 --> 0:17:40,21
and you get it very cold,
you get liquid nitrogen.


601
0:17:40,21 --> 0:17:43,41
Now, Kathy, the safety glasses
are great, but this is going


602
0:17:43,41 --> 0:17:44,47
to be awesome.


603
0:17:44,47 --> 0:17:45,565
So put on your--


604
0:17:45,565 --> 0:17:46,215
got it?


605
0:17:46,215 --> 0:17:47,465
How are you looking?


606
0:17:47,465 --> 0:17:50,52



607
0:17:50,52 --> 0:17:52,33
So here's the deal.


608
0:17:52,33 --> 0:17:55,73
We're going to take hot water
that's at about to 200 degrees


609
0:17:55,73 --> 0:17:57,99
right now, so it's really,
really hot, and then we're


610
0:17:57,99 --> 0:18:0,94
going to dump it into
the liquid nitrogen.


611
0:18:0,94 --> 0:18:2,87
And, I don't know, you
might see a little


612
0:18:2,87 --> 0:18:4,64
bubbling take place.


613
0:18:4,64 --> 0:18:6,9
KATHY SABINE: Wouldn't you
be afraid if you were me?


614
0:18:6,9 --> 0:18:8,39
STEVE SPANGLER: Or you
might get a cloud.


615
0:18:8,39 --> 0:18:10,79
And if it's cool, hopefully
we get to hear from you.


616
0:18:10,79 --> 0:18:12,8
Fair enough?


617
0:18:12,8 --> 0:18:13,11
OK, Kathy, here we go.


618
0:18:13,11 --> 0:18:13,496
Let's--


619
0:18:13,496 --> 0:18:14,88
KATHY SABINE: What
do I do, Steve?


620
0:18:14,88 --> 0:18:16,128
STEVE SPANGLER: Prepare
for whatever.


621
0:18:16,128 --> 0:18:18,44
KATHY SABINE: Prepare
for whatever?


622
0:18:18,44 --> 0:18:19,22
STEVE SPANGLER: Countdown
from five.


623
0:18:19,22 --> 0:18:19,81
Ready?


624
0:18:19,81 --> 0:18:23,72
BOTH: Five, four,
three, two, one.


625
0:18:23,72 --> 0:18:27,96



626
0:18:27,96 --> 0:18:30,84
STEVE SPANGLER: Isn't
that wild?


627
0:18:30,84 --> 0:18:31,23
KATHY SABINE: Wow!


628
0:18:31,23 --> 0:18:32,64
That was refreshing!


629
0:18:32,64 --> 0:18:34,11
STEVE SPANGLER: That
kind of fun?


630
0:18:34,11 --> 0:18:35,48
I love that!


631
0:18:35,48 --> 0:18:36,361
KATHY SABINE: Woo!


632
0:18:36,361 --> 0:18:37,774
Can we do that again, Steve?


633
0:18:37,774 --> 0:18:39,76
STEVE SPANGLER: We made
a cloud, people.


634
0:18:39,76 --> 0:18:41,15
This is a cloud, right?


635
0:18:41,15 --> 0:18:42,79
So there's our liquid
nitrogen.


636
0:18:42,79 --> 0:18:46,57
We went from a liquid to
a gas in just a second.


637
0:18:46,57 --> 0:18:47,17
Let me take this off.


638
0:18:47,17 --> 0:18:49,3
KATHY SABINE: That was very cool
and refreshing, Steve.


639
0:18:49,3 --> 0:18:49,98
STEVE SPANGLER: It was cool.


640
0:18:49,98 --> 0:18:53,22
What we had, people,
was an explosion.


641
0:18:53,22 --> 0:18:55,18
But what were we missing
with the explosion?


642
0:18:55,18 --> 0:18:58,5
We were missing the
kaboom, right?


643
0:18:58,5 --> 0:19:0,37
So would you look right
in front of you.


644
0:19:0,37 --> 0:19:4,115
There are four trash cans and
four trashcanologists--


645
0:19:4,115 --> 0:19:5,84
I don't know what else
to call them.


646

good to me, Steve.

are going to help us with


648
0:19:9,39 --> 0:19:10,61

649
0:19:10,61 --> 0:19:13,3
Please understand that what's
going to happen is only


650
0:19:13,3 --> 0:19:14,68
happening here at Coors Field.


651
0:19:14,68 --> 0:19:16,65
We are not doing
this at school.

We are not doing this at home.

This is just our special
demonstration that we are


654
0:19:20,65 --> 0:19:22,18
fortunate to be able
to share with you.

0:19:22,18 --> 0:19:23,44
KATHY SABINE: Steve, there's
stuff in my boots.


656
0:19:23,44 --> 0:19:24,86
STEVE SPANGLER: They
have a bottle


657
0:19:24,86 --> 0:19:26,27
sitting down by the side.


658
0:19:26,27 --> 0:19:28,37
They have a funnel-- show them
the funnel, if you don't mind.


659
0:19:28,37 --> 0:19:32,7
They have safety glasses, and
they have safety gloves.


660
0:19:32,7 --> 0:19:32,53
All right.


661
0:19:32,53 --> 0:19:33,58
Ready, team?


662
0:19:33,58 --> 0:19:34,6
Pour--


663
0:19:34,6 --> 0:19:36,7
give them a little applause and
a little cheering for the


664
0:19:36,7 --> 0:19:40,56
pouring because it's a little
hard getting it in there.


665
0:19:40,56 --> 0:19:42,34
Julie, you are going to speed
that up a little bit?


666
0:19:42,34 --> 0:19:44,13
Good job.


667
0:19:44,13 --> 0:19:47,35
So we figured that a little,
tiny kaboom at the very end


668
0:19:47,35 --> 0:19:51,77
would be a wonderful way to
finish up our program.


669
0:19:51,77 --> 0:19:55,16
Team, would you show me when
you are at that point.


670
0:19:55,16 --> 0:19:57,12
You can hold up the bottle
and show me.


671
0:19:57,12 --> 0:19:58,85
Please notice their
safety glasses on.


672
0:19:58,85 --> 0:20:1,32
Kathy, you and I have our
safety glasses on.


673
0:20:1,32 --> 0:20:4,15
So now we're going to get a
rapid expansion of that gas.

Ready?

0:20:5,0 --> 0:20:6,73
