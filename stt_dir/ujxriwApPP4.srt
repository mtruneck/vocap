1
0:0:15,218 --> 0:0:17,917
Thank you. 
It's a pleasure to be here.


2
0:0:17,917 --> 0:0:19,682
When something really matters


3
0:0:19,682 --> 0:0:21,422
it elicits emotion


4
0:0:21,422 --> 0:0:23,879
and how do we help people 
communicate emotion,


5
0:0:23,879 --> 0:0:26,23
to make life better, 
whether at home,


6
0:0:26,23 --> 0:0:30,49
at work, for your customers, 
for your kids at school?


7
0:0:30,49 --> 0:0:33,108
Our challenge at The MIT Media Lab 
and at Affectiva,


8
0:0:33,108 --> 0:0:34,766
has been to come up with better ways


9
0:0:34,766 --> 0:0:36,967
to measure and help people 
communicate emotion.


10
0:0:36,967 --> 0:0:39,169
I'll start with an example 
that we did years ago


11
0:0:39,169 --> 0:0:41,498
which was a skin conducting sensor


12
0:0:41,498 --> 0:0:45,433
that we gave to an audience like you,
worn on the palm of the hand


13
0:0:45,433 --> 0:0:48,272
and it glowed brightly every time


14
0:0:48,272 --> 0:0:50,954
the audience got excited. 
Every time they were engaged.


15
0:0:50,954 --> 0:0:52,596
We learned a lot that day.


16
0:0:52,596 --> 0:0:55,4
We learned for example 
that every time a new speaker


17
0:0:55,4 --> 0:0:57,879
came out on stage, 
the audience glowed.


18
0:0:57,879 --> 0:1:1,65
Every time there was a live demonstration,


19
0:1:1,65 --> 0:1:3,811
whether it worked or not, 
the audience glowed.


20
0:1:3,811 --> 0:1:8,282
Every time there was live Q&A or laughter,


21
0:1:8,282 --> 0:1:12,59
the audience glowed 
but unfortunately, every single time


22
0:1:12,59 --> 0:1:14,928
there was a PowerPoint presentation


23
0:1:14,928 --> 0:1:17,707
there was a decaying exponential 
in brightness.


24
0:1:17,707 --> 0:1:19,742
(Laughter)


25
0:1:19,742 --> 0:1:21,492
Let's, let's look more closely


26
0:1:21,492 --> 0:1:24,346
at an example of the signal changing.


27
0:1:24,346 --> 0:1:28,903
Here, for a nine year old boy,
watching a movie trailer,


28
0:1:28,903 --> 0:1:32,938
the signal will go up about a second 
after each of the parts of the trailer


29
0:1:32,938 --> 0:1:35,264
that cause him to engage.


30
0:1:35,264 --> 0:1:36,876
Starting with the music.


31
0:1:36,876 --> 0:2:0,79
(Music)


32
0:2:0,79 --> 0:2:2,22
The three biggest peaks.


33
0:2:2,22 --> 0:2:17,903
(Laughter)


34
0:2:17,903 --> 0:2:21,569
See this is where it 
kind of falls of here though.


35
0:2:21,569 --> 0:2:26,151
(Music)


36
0:2:26,151 --> 0:2:29,52
He peaks for the name of the movie 
and the date of it,


37
0:2:29,52 --> 0:2:32,514
so you can see why people 
in Market Research and Advertising


38
0:2:32,514 --> 0:2:34,676
are extremely interested
in this information


39
0:2:34,676 --> 0:2:37,831
or I as an educator, 
I'm extremely interested too.


40
0:2:37,831 --> 0:2:39,704
'Cause I want to know what content


41
0:2:39,704 --> 0:2:44,279
is connecting with my students 
and with my loved ones.


42
0:2:44,279 --> 0:2:48,765
Here's an example of the signal 
changing with a Patriots fan,


43
0:2:48,765 --> 0:2:50,533
back when the Patriots 
were in the Superbowl.


44
0:2:50,533 --> 0:2:54,58
And this one illustrates an important point 
about skin conductance


45
0:2:54,58 --> 0:2:57,693
and that is even as we measure 
the auto-immunic arousal


46
0:2:57,693 --> 0:2:59,374
of a person and their excitement.


47
0:2:59,374 --> 0:3:1,748
This goes up with things 
that are good or bad.


48
0:3:1,748 --> 0:3:5,376
So we see it go up here 
when the guy has a --


49
0:3:5,376 --> 0:3:6,667
when his favorite team 
scores a touchdown,


50
0:3:6,667 --> 0:3:9,325
it also goes up 
during an endzone overthrow.


51
0:3:9,325 --> 0:3:11,716
So it goes up with good and bad.


52
0:3:11,716 --> 0:3:14,804
Interestingly, it also goes up 
during a Dorito's Mouse T.V. commercial,


53
0:3:14,804 --> 0:3:17,898
when the mouse comes out 
and catches the man.


54
0:3:17,898 --> 0:3:20,292
(Laughter)


55
0:3:20,292 --> 0:3:24,261
It's interesting now that we can get 
this information in real life,


56
0:3:24,261 --> 0:3:28,81
to see how relatively important 
different events are in life


57
0:3:28,81 --> 0:3:31,772
and where the significance of something 
that you share with somebody,


58
0:3:31,772 --> 0:3:36,399
compares with this response to some other things 
that are going on with their life.


59
0:3:36,399 --> 0:3:38,705
What drives this signal?


60
0:3:38,705 --> 0:3:42,141
This skin conductance is driven 
by the autonomic nervous system,


61
0:3:42,141 --> 0:3:44,265
sympathetic nervous system response.


62
0:3:44,265 --> 0:3:46,663
Your autonomic nervous system 
has two main branches,


63
0:3:46,663 --> 0:3:48,635
the sympathetic and the parasympathetic.


64
0:3:48,635 --> 0:3:52,562
The sympathetic can be thought of kind of like 
stepping on the gas, in the car,


65
0:3:52,562 --> 0:3:55,955
it revs your heart up, it causes 
the skin conductance to increase.


66
0:3:55,955 --> 0:3:58,881
The parasympathetic causes
the heart to decrease.


67
0:3:58,881 --> 0:4:1,557
The sympathetic is thought of 
as fight or flight,


68
0:4:1,557 --> 0:4:3,961
the parasympathetic is rest & digest.


69
0:4:3,961 --> 0:4:8,19
Almost all the organs are innervated by both 
the sympathetic and the parasympathetic,


70
0:4:8,19 --> 0:4:10,387
except the skin, 
which gets the pure sympathetic,


71
0:4:10,387 --> 0:4:13,824
which makes it ideal for us measuring 
this fight or flight response.


72
0:4:13,824 --> 0:4:17,547
Now, I became interested in measuring this response
when I started working a lot


73
0:4:17,547 --> 0:4:20,759
with people in the autism spectrum, 
who are non-speaking.


74
0:4:20,759 --> 0:4:23,696
The most heart-breaking stories, 
that I hear from these --


75
0:4:23,696 --> 0:4:26,517
from the families 
and the individuals themselves,


76
0:4:26,517 --> 0:4:29,227
when they later acquire 
the ability to speak,


77
0:4:29,227 --> 0:4:35,116
is that, the changes that were worst, 
were when they got kicked out of school


78
0:4:35,116 --> 0:4:37,147
or were shipped off 
to an institution,


79
0:4:37,147 --> 0:4:39,979
removed from learning opportunities 
and social opportunities.


80
0:4:39,979 --> 0:4:43,22
What caused that to happen?


81
0:4:43,22 --> 0:4:45,963
Usually it was a meltdown 
or a series of meltdowns


82
0:4:45,963 --> 0:4:50,561
and the meltdowns, like adult tantrums, 
appear to come from nowhere.


83
0:4:50,561 --> 0:4:52,615
One moment the person seemed
calm and relaxed,


84
0:4:52,615 --> 0:4:55,283
the next moment they might have become injurious


85
0:4:55,283 --> 0:4:57,13
to themselves or to others.


86
0:4:57,13 --> 0:5:0,215
So, they seemed very unpredictable 
and uncontrollable.


87
0:5:0,215 --> 0:5:4,181
Now, as we undertook the privilege 
of getting to know some individuals


88
0:5:4,181 --> 0:5:6,357
who could later communicate, 
they told us that these meltdowns


89
0:5:6,357 --> 0:5:9,622
never came from nowhere
that, in fact, they were always preceeded


90
0:5:9,622 --> 0:5:11,92
by increasing stress and frustration.


91
0:5:11,92 --> 0:5:14,993
They couldn't understand why people 
couldn't see what was bugging them.


92
0:5:14,993 --> 0:5:18,142
So this made me think,
"Wow, what if we could enable them


93
0:5:18,142 --> 0:5:20,515
even though they can't communicate,


94
0:5:20,515 --> 0:5:24,355
to signal out their increasing stress 
and frustration?"


95
0:5:24,355 --> 0:5:28,65
But to do that required a device 
that is shown on the left here,


96
0:5:28,65 --> 0:5:30,273
a classic, galvanic skin response,


97
0:5:30,273 --> 0:5:32,756
skin conductance 
sympathetic nervous system measure,


98
0:5:32,756 --> 0:5:34,878
that involved a lot of wires and boxes,


99
0:5:34,878 --> 0:5:37,597
and that was uncomfortable 
to wear in daily life.


100
0:5:37,597 --> 0:5:41,174
So my team at MIT went through 
lots of iterations


101
0:5:41,174 --> 0:5:43,974
until we came up with a device 
that could be worn robustly


102
0:5:43,974 --> 0:5:46,554
on the wrist and gather data in real life.


103
0:5:46,554 --> 0:5:49,5
This has just been commercialized by Affectiva


104
0:5:49,5 --> 0:5:52,261
and I'm pleased to say 
is finally available as a product


105
0:5:52,261 --> 0:5:55,695
for people to gather 
and communicate this information


106
0:5:55,695 --> 0:5:58,7
in the real world, 
outside the lab.


107
0:5:58,7 --> 0:6:3,782
Here's the first example of seven days of data 
that I saw from a student at MIT


108
0:6:3,782 --> 0:6:6,705
wearing the skin conductance sensor 
on his wrist.


109
0:6:6,705 --> 0:6:11,51
And the first thing that jumped out here 
was there's a lot of studying and it's very activating.


110
0:6:11,51 --> 0:6:15,339
Studying and lab work, in fact, sort of
to the discouragement of we, professors,


111
0:6:15,339 --> 0:6:20,343
is much more arousing 
that any of the classroom activity. (Laughter)


112
0:6:20,343 --> 0:6:25,343
We also saw these huge peaks that were happening 
during sleep which puzzled us in the first place.


113
0:6:25,343 --> 0:6:28,12
We just expected sleep to be flat.


114
0:6:28,12 --> 0:6:30,97
Generally, as we did 
further polysonography,


115
0:6:30,97 --> 0:6:33,569
and teamed up with some expert 
sleep researchers on this,


116
0:6:33,569 --> 0:6:35,993
we found that these peaks tend to occur


117
0:6:35,993 --> 0:6:39,313
during slow wave sleep or deep sleep, 
and we're now looking at the relation


118
0:6:39,313 --> 0:6:42,968
of those to sleep quality 
and memory and learning.


119
0:6:42,968 --> 0:6:47,169
Here's an example, 
of a girl on the autism spectrum,


120
0:6:47,169 --> 0:6:51,618
where she's able to communicate out 
her arousal level, using this sensor.


121
0:6:51,618 --> 0:6:54,273
Here she's wearing one on each ankle 
so you'll see two signals streaming


122
0:6:54,273 --> 0:6:55,876
across the bottom.


123
0:6:55,876 --> 0:6:59,364
She's wearing it while she's undergoing 
an ordinary occupational therapy session.


124
0:6:59,364 --> 0:7:3,886
This is 45 minutes 
of an ordinary session here,


125
0:7:3,886 --> 0:7:5,912
and you'll see, you know, 
it peaked here


126
0:7:5,912 --> 0:7:8,48
and she had a little bit of a meltdown here, 
got in a ball-pit,


127
0:7:8,48 --> 0:7:10,651
calmed down, peaked here, 
calmed down.


128
0:7:10,651 --> 0:7:15,254
What you see up here, in blue, is right now, 
this window here


129
0:7:15,254 --> 0:7:19,24
the right edge is what you're seeing in the video 
and we see that it peeked


130
0:7:19,24 --> 0:7:21,626
as she climbed on this swing, 
but as she starts swinging,


131
0:7:21,626 --> 0:7:26,525
as that rhythmic activity kicks in, 
it has this nice, decaying exponential.


132
0:7:26,525 --> 0:7:31,112
We see for many people on the autisim spectrum, 
when they rock, or do these repetitive movements


133
0:7:31,112 --> 0:7:33,164
they can be very calming for them.


134
0:7:33,164 --> 0:7:36,315
They're not just doing that 
to be difficult or something.


135
0:7:36,315 --> 0:7:38,381
It didn't have a very important, regulatory effect.


136
0:7:38,381 --> 0:7:42,695
In fact, I've noticed an increasing number 
of rocking chairs, cropping up in airports


137
0:7:42,695 --> 0:7:46,931
since 9/11 and they're almost always taken, 
at least at Boston Logan.


138
0:7:46,931 --> 0:7:50,635
I think that's a healthy sign.


139
0:7:50,635 --> 0:7:54,603
Once you get the ability to make 
a new measure in the real world


140
0:7:54,603 --> 0:7:58,223
and have people wear it, 
unobtrusively in daily life,


141
0:7:58,223 --> 0:8:2,11
you learn a lot of things that are surprising 
and this is a really special surprise we ran into.


142
0:8:2,11 --> 0:8:4,847
One of our kids on the autism spectrum
was wearing this over Christmas.


143
0:8:4,847 --> 0:8:9,95
I was looking at the data and I saw 
this enormous peak on one side


144
0:8:9,95 --> 0:8:13,653
not the other side, I thought: "Oh dear, something 
is going wrong with the sensor!"


145
0:8:13,653 --> 0:8:16,758
I looked more closely and it looked like 
it was fine before the peak and after.


146
0:8:16,758 --> 0:8:19,14
I asked his brother, "Any idea 
what could have happened here?"


147
0:8:19,14 --> 0:8:23,47
and he said, "I was with him 
and he had a seizure right after."


148
0:8:23,47 --> 0:8:27,65
Wow! I got on the phone with Joe Madson, 
Boston Children's Hospital,


149
0:8:27,65 --> 0:8:29,8
"Is there any way somebody could have 
a huge auto-immunic surge


150
0:8:29,8 --> 0:8:32,402
on one side of the body 
with a big seizure?"


151
0:8:32,402 --> 0:8:33,716
He said: "Yes"


152
0:8:33,716 --> 0:8:36,952
Fast forward about 8,000 hours of data 
and extensive analysis,


153
0:8:36,952 --> 0:8:40,41
led by my student, Ming-Zher Poh 
for his doctoral work


154
0:8:40,41 --> 0:8:45,284
and we have now shown that measuring signals 
from the wrist, reflects signals


155
0:8:45,284 --> 0:8:48,107
measured from the brain 
and the seizures are labeled


156
0:8:48,107 --> 0:8:53,733
by the epileptologists reading the EEG only, 
they coincide exactly with these peaks,


157
0:8:53,733 --> 0:8:58,108
measured just from this electrical signal, 
from the surface of the skin, on the wrist.


158
0:8:58,108 --> 0:8:59,743
So this was really mind blowing to me!


159
0:8:59,743 --> 0:9:6,364
That a change in our brain could show up as these events, picked up through a simple wrist band.


160
0:9:6,364 --> 0:9:12,174
We're hoping this now can lead to better detection
and treatment in real time


161
0:9:12,174 --> 0:9:16,889
of people who suffer from seizures, 
of the seizure events themselves.


162
0:9:16,889 --> 0:9:21,245
Now another thing that kind of surprised me 
in doing this, was --


163
0:9:21,245 --> 0:9:23,824
the events show up, 
sometimes, on just one side.


164
0:9:23,824 --> 0:9:26,229
Usually the two sides 
are showing the same information.


165
0:9:26,229 --> 0:9:29,599
We where just measuring two sides 
for redundancy, to cancel noise,


166
0:9:29,599 --> 0:9:34,452
but we found that -- we learned something
that was already in the literature


167
0:9:34,452 --> 0:9:38,923
the right hemisphere of the brain controls 
the electrodermal activity of the right palmar surface,


168
0:9:38,923 --> 0:9:40,562
and the left, 
the left.


169
0:9:40,562 --> 0:9:44,298
I sort of rediscovered this when a tragic event 
happened in my family.


170
0:9:44,298 --> 0:9:48,575
I lost a loved one and that day I was at work, 
having trouble speaking.


171
0:9:48,575 --> 0:9:51,761
Those who know me, 
know I never have trouble speaking.


172
0:9:51,761 --> 0:9:54,359
So, one of my colleagues, 
Ron Elco, said:


173
0:9:54,359 --> 0:9:56,808
"Put a sensor on both sides!"


174
0:9:56,808 --> 0:10:1,445
I'm strongly right-handed and sure enough, 
the left side was incredibly suppressed.


175
0:10:1,445 --> 0:10:6,421
That night I was, sitting in the kitchen,
in this total stupor,


176
0:10:6,421 --> 0:10:9,364
just kind a stirring a pot of something


177
0:10:9,364 --> 0:10:12,37
and one of my sons came up 
and started rubbing my back


178
0:10:12,37 --> 0:10:15,876
which, I felt really blessed, 
this is a very special moment,


179
0:10:15,876 --> 0:10:20,933
I almost felt hope restored and then, his little brother 
came up and did the same thing to him.


180
0:10:20,933 --> 0:10:24,546
I had one of those rare moments of parental bliss, 
where you kind of tingle down to your toes


181
0:10:24,546 --> 0:10:28,362
especially as a mom of sons.


182
0:10:28,362 --> 0:10:30,17
And -- 
(Laughter)


183
0:10:30,17 --> 0:10:34,328
at that moment, my little one looks up at the display 
in the kitchen, 'cause of course


184
0:10:34,328 --> 0:10:37,204
I'm streaming my data 
wirelessly to this monitor,


185
0:10:37,204 --> 0:10:38,842
(Laughter)


186
0:10:38,842 --> 0:10:41,588
and he says:
"Mommy, you're lines crossed!"


187
0:10:41,588 --> 0:10:45,362
My right signal that was way above my left, 
had come together


188
0:10:45,362 --> 0:10:48,16
during that moment of parental bliss.


189
0:10:48,16 --> 0:10:52,352
Now I thought: "Wow! I've heard about 
positive and negative stuff for the brain


190
0:10:52,352 --> 0:10:55,603
you now might show up but I never thought 
this could show up on the wrist.


191
0:10:55,603 --> 0:10:59,898
Now, that's just a few data points, 
but I monitored myself overtime,


192
0:10:59,898 --> 0:11:3,423
with sleep and sure enough, 
the signal, as I recovered,


193
0:11:3,423 --> 0:11:7,246
went back to the normal 
sort of switching, left and right.


194
0:11:7,246 --> 0:11:11,833
Now this is just a few data points but it shows 
that there's this whole new potential to explore


195
0:11:11,833 --> 0:11:18,153
what's going on in the brain, even by measuring
some of these peripheral signals downstream.


196
0:11:18,153 --> 0:11:22,22
There are many positive moments as well,
that people have shared with us,


197
0:11:22,22 --> 0:11:23,801
using our emotion technology.


198
0:11:23,801 --> 0:11:29,207
Here's one from a bride in India, who, naturaly, 
was sort of stressed out before her wedding


199
0:11:29,207 --> 0:11:30,995
you see lots of peaks.


200
0:11:30,995 --> 0:11:34,19
Her friend loved seeing this part 
where she was chilling with her friends


201
0:11:34,19 --> 0:11:37,809
and they helped calm her down before 
and then the four major peaks here,


202
0:11:37,809 --> 0:11:39,801
during the wedding ceremony.


203
0:11:39,801 --> 0:11:42,66
The first, where the vows 
were exchanged,


204
0:11:42,66 --> 0:11:45,292
the second, third and fourth 
in the Hindu ceremony


205
0:11:45,292 --> 0:11:48,469
where the bride and groom 
exchange symbolic gestures


206
0:11:48,469 --> 0:11:54,957
that they are now 
husband and wife.


207
0:11:54,957 --> 0:11:58,944
Here's an example where a mother 
and a daughter wanted to share


208
0:11:58,944 --> 0:12:1,906
the daughter's experience at school.


209
0:12:1,906 --> 0:12:6,47
The daughter had her first, big concert, 
in front of school that day.


210
0:12:6,47 --> 0:12:10,44
She was playing a harp and singing 
in front of the entire school


211
0:12:10,44 --> 0:12:13,438
and she expected it would be kind of 
peeked there, and it was.


212
0:12:13,438 --> 0:12:17,748
Also it was very peeked during physical education, 
to be expected


213
0:12:17,748 --> 0:12:22,23
anything that gives physical exertion, 
makes you sweat, can be very arousing.


214
0:12:22,23 --> 0:12:24,459
Her mom was very disappointed 
to see that math lessons,


215
0:12:24,459 --> 0:12:25,71
(Laughter)


216
0:12:25,71 --> 0:12:28,73
was the low point of the day.


217
0:12:28,73 --> 0:12:32,658
But there was this other, huge peak there 
between Reading and PE, and --


218
0:12:32,658 --> 0:12:35,339
What was that?


219
0:12:35,339 --> 0:12:39,181
Turned out the daughter had a talk 
with her mom, later that day.


220
0:12:39,181 --> 0:12:43,875
In fact as she recalled this experience, we see 
the emotions coming back up again.


221
0:12:43,875 --> 0:12:50,14
This was this horrible, bullying event that she 
was being dragged into by her friends.


222
0:12:50,14 --> 0:12:53,654
Wouldn't it be amazing if the people 
we care most about


223
0:12:53,654 --> 0:12:57,155
were given the opportunity 
to share, in an externalized way


224
0:12:57,155 --> 0:12:59,996
some of what was going in their day
that was so difficult.


225
0:12:59,996 --> 0:13:5,72
Whether they can speak or not, this can be 
a powerful way to take your emotions outside of you


226
0:13:5,72 --> 0:13:10,44
and begin to reflect on them 
and share them with others.


227
0:13:10,44 --> 0:13:14,15
I have one last example with 
the skin conductance sensor, a personal one.


228
0:13:14,15 --> 0:13:17,569
I discovered one day 
while taking my son


229
0:13:17,569 --> 0:13:21,251
ona birthday outing to Six Flags, 
that I indeed had big peaks


230
0:13:21,251 --> 0:13:23,27
with the Roller Coasters, 
which I love,


231
0:13:23,27 --> 0:13:27,608
and a really awful one with a ride that 
I won't tell you about, that was very unpleasant.


232
0:13:27,608 --> 0:13:29,197
(Laughter)


233
0:13:29,197 --> 0:13:32,11
But the surprise to me, when I looked at the data 
at the end of the day,


234
0:13:32,11 --> 0:13:38,988
was not that I had this huge peak when I'm 
on the fastest, highest, most intense roller coaster


235
0:13:38,988 --> 0:13:42,751
in all of New England, but it was actually 
earlier in the day


236
0:13:42,751 --> 0:13:45,731
when we were just trying
to get out the door.


237
0:13:45,731 --> 0:13:51,985
(Laughter)


238
0:13:51,985 --> 0:13:56,41
Many people on the autism spectrum 
who are conversant,


239
0:13:56,41 --> 0:13:59,276
tell us that they have difficulty 
reading facial expressions,


240
0:13:59,276 --> 0:14:0,474
they are trying to pay attention


241
0:14:0,474 --> 0:14:3,95
to what you're saying 
and at the same time,


242
0:14:3,95 --> 0:14:7,417
they can't tell if you're looking pleased 
or displeased, interested or bored.


243
0:14:7,417 --> 0:14:10,857
In particular, many of them have asked us
if we could please help them


244
0:14:10,857 --> 0:14:13,321
to have some technology 
that tells them if the person


245
0:14:13,321 --> 0:14:18,319
they're speaking with is still interested 
or if they're boring them.


246
0:14:18,319 --> 0:14:22,698
So this next example is a short video clip,
introducing my collaborator on this work,


247
0:14:22,698 --> 0:14:26,834
Dr. Rana el Kaliouby, who' s also 
my co-founder at Afaktiva


248
0:14:26,834 --> 0:14:30,642
and the chief architect 
of our face reading software.


249
0:14:30,642 --> 0:14:36,459
"-- Which would be recording your facial expressions
and analysing them in real time.


250
0:14:36,459 --> 0:14:40,582
So we use 24 feature points, on the face, 
like the the eyes, mouth, eyebrows,


251
0:14:40,582 --> 0:14:44,957
and we use those to recognize facial expressions 
like, a smile, a lip pucker,


252
0:14:44,957 --> 0:14:48,469
eyebrow raise and a mouth open 
and so on.


253
0:14:48,469 --> 0:14:51,518
And we look at these over time 
and we sort of use them


254
0:14:51,518 --> 0:14:56,365
along with head gestures to make a guess 
at your hidden understatement.


255
0:14:56,365 --> 0:15:8,601
(Video)


256
0:15:8,601 --> 0:15:11,99
Each person is wearing a camera, 
pointing at their own face often.


257
0:15:11,99 --> 0:15:24,882
(Video)


258
0:15:24,882 --> 0:15:30,764
(Laughter)


259
0:15:30,764 --> 0:15:34,46
All right. Using this technology, 
there are many things we can recognize


260
0:15:34,46 --> 0:15:39,76
and many things we can learn, for example 
I learned that actually, I was quite interested


261
0:15:39,76 --> 0:15:43,47
in what he had to say, but I started 
to feel dis-interested


262
0:15:43,47 --> 0:15:44,383
because he never paused,


263
0:15:44,383 --> 0:15:47,703
he never gave me a chance 
to go into thinking mode,


264
0:15:47,703 --> 0:15:49,292
process the information and return.


265
0:15:49,292 --> 0:15:52,304
Or when I did, he had moved on 
and I was lost.


266
0:15:52,304 --> 0:15:57,119
So as we do this fine grain measurement of emotion, 
we learn a lot of things about how to improve


267
0:15:57,119 --> 0:16:2,456
our interactions with one another 
or how to improve our interactions on-line


268
0:16:2,456 --> 0:16:4,991
or elsewhere in the world.


269
0:16:4,991 --> 0:16:10,198
Here is just an example reminding us that, you know, 
while emotion is about what matters most,


270
0:16:10,198 --> 0:16:15,117
it's also communicating this complicated language, 
that is non-verbal.


271
0:16:15,117 --> 0:16:18,9
In order to get a computer
to learn how to read this,


272
0:16:18,9 --> 0:16:22,992
we have to solve an extraordinary,
complex problem


273
0:16:22,992 --> 0:16:26,254
that makes chess and Go
look trivial in comparison.


274
0:16:26,254 --> 0:16:30,86
With over ten thousand facial expressions 
that can be communicated and changed,


275
0:16:30,86 --> 0:16:34,785
every second, multiplied by the faces 
participating in a conversation,


276
0:16:34,785 --> 0:16:40,745
the social, emotional games people play 
is probably the hardest computer science


277
0:16:40,745 --> 0:16:45,303
problem to solve, 
in the next century as we go forth.


278
0:16:45,303 --> 0:16:48,458
The complexity is just astronomical.


279
0:16:48,458 --> 0:16:54,161
What we are starting to work on at MIT 
and in partnership with Affectiva, in this next project,


280
0:16:54,161 --> 0:16:58,908
is a way to go online, to get right now 
thousands and hopefully, before long,


281
0:16:58,908 --> 0:17:3,752
millions of examples of natural facial expressions, 
while they happen online.


282
0:17:3,752 --> 0:17:8,562
Here's an example where we partnered 
with an interactive task on Forbes.


283
0:17:8,562 --> 0:17:10,763
You can go to Forbes.com 
and try this out.


284
0:17:10,763 --> 0:17:14,575
You click on one of the T.V. commercials. 
These are designed to elicit delight


285
0:17:14,575 --> 0:17:19,434
and we measure your smiles 
and we show the results here


286
0:17:19,434 --> 0:17:22,805
for one of the commercials, 
for three groups of people.


287
0:17:22,805 --> 0:17:26,835
Those who say they have seen 
the video many times,


288
0:17:26,835 --> 0:17:32,83
those who have seen it once or twice 
and those who say this is their first time.


289
0:17:32,83 --> 0:17:35,37
This should be playing.


290
0:17:35,37 --> 0:17:39,32
But for some reason it's not playing. 
Clicking!


291
0:17:39,32 --> 0:17:43,29
And what will happen 
when they get there and play this video


292
0:17:43,29 --> 0:17:49,28
is you'll see the video synchronized
with the peaks, on the graph.


293
0:17:49,28 --> 0:17:52,942
You can go online and see this,
if they can't get it working here.


294
0:17:52,942 --> 0:17:55,908
If you go to Forbes.com 
and search for interactive smile


295
0:17:55,908 --> 0:18:1,371
you can participate, give our researchers
your facial expression data.


296
0:18:1,371 --> 0:18:5,17
You can also see the results 
and see interesting things, like, you know,


297
0:18:5,17 --> 0:18:9,8
"Do people smile where you smile, 
if you smile at the dog?"


298
0:18:9,8 --> 0:18:11,999
One thing we learned is that people 
who have seen it before


299
0:18:11,999 --> 0:18:17,63
smile much earlier in anticipation 
and they also smiled a lot more,


300
0:18:17,63 --> 0:18:20,35
for these popular videos that they like.


301
0:18:20,35 --> 0:18:27,371
I seem to have lost my slides completely here. 
I will wrap up and just tell you


302
0:18:27,371 --> 0:18:32,834
whether the emotions 
are online or in real life,


303
0:18:32,834 --> 0:18:36,41
whether they're to help somebody 
who is speaking or non-speaking


304
0:18:36,41 --> 0:18:38,907
or just to capture some 
of those most positive emotions,


305
0:18:38,907 --> 0:18:41,539
moments in life, new technology,


306
0:18:41,539 --> 0:18:45,923
is enabling people to communicate emotion, 
in ways never before possible.


307
0:18:45,923 --> 0:18:49,891
I'd love to hear from you, how this technology 
could help improve lives for you,


308
0:18:49,891 --> 0:18:53,956
your business, your customers 
and your loved ones.


309
0:18:53,956 --> 0:18:55,231
Thank you.


310
0:18:55,231 --> 0:20:55,231
(Applause)
