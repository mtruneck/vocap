1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:0,14



2
0:0:0,14 --> 0:0:4,9
Sugar, sugar, sugar,
lots of sugar.


3
0:0:4,9 --> 0:0:7,23
Sugar, sugar, sugar, sugar,
sugar, sugar, sugar.


4
0:0:7,23 --> 0:0:8,0
This is kind of interesting
here.


5
0:0:8,0 --> 0:0:9,85
Take a look at this.


6
0:0:9,85 --> 0:0:12,29
Total cereal, right.


7
0:0:12,29 --> 0:0:14,62
Take a look at the side there.


8
0:0:14,62 --> 0:0:16,335
It's like a science lab.


9
0:0:16,335 --> 0:0:17,72
Look at iron.


10
0:0:17,72 --> 0:0:21,145
100% of your recommended
daily allowance.


11
0:0:21,145 --> 0:0:22,8
Is that true?


12
0:0:22,8 --> 0:0:25,72
Is there really iron in
breakfast cereal?


13
0:0:25,72 --> 0:0:27,35
Only one way to find out.


14
0:0:27,35 --> 0:0:30,29
You're going to be buying
a box soon, trust me.


15
0:0:30,29 --> 0:0:33,52
I'm Steve Spangler, and I'm all
about making science fun.


16
0:0:33,52 --> 0:0:36,39
For the last 20 years, I've
been teaching ways to turn


17
0:0:36,39 --> 0:0:39,4
ordinary science experiments
into unforgettable learning


18
0:0:39,4 --> 0:0:40,41
experiences.


19
0:0:40,41 --> 0:0:43,3
I have an amazing team who will
do whatever it takes to


20
0:0:43,3 --> 0:0:45,8
affect the way people
think about science.


21
0:0:45,8 --> 0:0:48,8
And to do that, I live
by one motto.


22
0:0:48,8 --> 0:0:51,9
Make it big, do it right,
give it class.


23
0:0:51,9 --> 0:0:56,6



24
0:0:56,6 --> 0:0:59,37
So the only way to figure out
whether or not this iron is


25
0:0:59,37 --> 0:1:2,42
actually metallic
iron is to do a


26
0:1:2,42 --> 0:1:3,67
little test with a magnet.


27
0:1:3,67 --> 0:1:6,15
Now an ordinary magnet doesn't
seem to work that well, so if


28
0:1:6,15 --> 0:1:8,66
you want the best results
possible, you're going to need


29
0:1:8,66 --> 0:1:9,23
one of these.


30
0:1:9,23 --> 0:1:12,74
It's a really, really
strong magnet.


31
0:1:12,74 --> 0:1:15,98
You can see how it jumps
to and attaches to


32
0:1:15,98 --> 0:1:17,46
anything like this.


33
0:1:17,46 --> 0:1:21,375
And in fact, if you have one
magnet in your hand like this,


34
0:1:21,375 --> 0:1:25,3
you can actually attract
the second magnet and


35
0:1:25,3 --> 0:1:26,15
you see what happens.


36
0:1:26,15 --> 0:1:28,52
This can be very, very dangerous
because if you try


37
0:1:28,52 --> 0:1:31,34
to pull one magnet off and it
jumps up into the other one,


38
0:1:31,34 --> 0:1:33,23
it can actually pinch
your fingers.


39
0:1:33,23 --> 0:1:36,15
That's why I recommend storing
the magnets using this


40
0:1:36,15 --> 0:1:37,43
particular method here.


41
0:1:37,43 --> 0:1:40,53
Just take a tennis ball
and cut it open here.


42
0:1:40,53 --> 0:1:43,2
So cut open the tennis ball
like this, and drop the


43
0:1:43,2 --> 0:1:46,0
neodymium into the
tennis ball.


44
0:1:46,0 --> 0:1:48,11
You can seal it back up with a
little glue if you want to,


45
0:1:48,11 --> 0:1:50,43
but this is just the way that I
store them, because they're


46
0:1:50,43 --> 0:1:52,78
easy to be able to
hook together--


47
0:1:52,78 --> 0:1:54,21
and, here, that's kind of fun.


48
0:1:54,21 --> 0:1:55,31
So watch this.


49
0:1:55,31 --> 0:1:56,86
You can mess with people
like this.


50
0:1:56,86 --> 0:1:58,94
You try to do the
balancing trick.


51
0:1:58,94 --> 0:2:1,33
Remember I've got one
here and one here.


52
0:2:1,33 --> 0:2:3,3
So here, watch this.


53
0:2:3,3 --> 0:2:4,375
Isn't that awe--


54
0:2:4,375 --> 0:2:6,74
ah, see, you can kind of
see how that works.


55
0:2:6,74 --> 0:2:9,19
But what a great way to be
able to hold on to the


56
0:2:9,19 --> 0:2:12,8
neodymium magnets without
pinching them accidentally


57
0:2:12,8 --> 0:2:15,8
between your layer of skin.


58
0:2:15,8 --> 0:2:17,516
And just a great way to be able
to mess with people at


59
0:2:17,516 --> 0:2:18,72
the same time.


60
0:2:18,72 --> 0:2:20,56
All right, so let's
start with this.


61
0:2:20,56 --> 0:2:22,97
Simply open up the box
of Total cereal.


62
0:2:22,97 --> 0:2:25,31
If you're doing this for
somebody, they're going to


63
0:2:25,31 --> 0:2:27,95
think that you tampered with it,
so you really should show


64
0:2:27,95 --> 0:2:29,32
them that you're opening
up the cereal.


65
0:2:29,32 --> 0:2:33,25
So here is, unopened,
from the factory.


66
0:2:33,25 --> 0:2:36,2
There is our cereal.


67
0:2:36,2 --> 0:2:38,6
Take out a couple flakes
here like this.


68
0:2:38,6 --> 0:2:42,15
If it's magnetic, then we should
be able to just pick up


69
0:2:42,15 --> 0:2:45,28
the cereal using the magnet.


70
0:2:45,28 --> 0:2:46,72
So, to isolate it--


71
0:2:46,72 --> 0:2:49,5
here, let me hang onto
it like this.


72
0:2:49,5 --> 0:2:51,63
Let's just crush it up.


73
0:2:51,63 --> 0:2:53,57
All right, and so you should
be able to just pick up the


74
0:2:53,57 --> 0:2:57,8
cereal, and of course, you can
see that we're no luck picking


75
0:2:57,8 --> 0:3:1,12
up the cereal, unless you
look very, very closely.


76
0:3:1,12 --> 0:3:5,49
Watch and look at the edges of
the cereal, you start to see,


77
0:3:5,49 --> 0:3:7,2
right around the edge here--


78
0:3:7,2 --> 0:3:9,67
what could either be static
electricity--


79
0:3:9,67 --> 0:3:15,2
or maybe there really is iron
in that breakfast cereal.


80
0:3:15,2 --> 0:3:16,72
Smashing them is not going
to convince anybody.


81
0:3:16,72 --> 0:3:18,94
I don't think that's a true
test if there's iron in


82
0:3:18,94 --> 0:3:19,61
breakfast cereal.


83
0:3:19,61 --> 0:3:21,4
So try this.


84
0:3:21,4 --> 0:3:24,67
Try reaching in and getting
some huge flakes,


85
0:3:24,67 --> 0:3:25,99
and let's do this.


86
0:3:25,99 --> 0:3:32,14
Let's see whether or not we can
attract them using a dish


87
0:3:32,14 --> 0:3:33,53
of water, all right.


88
0:3:33,53 --> 0:3:36,0
So here's our plate
with water.


89
0:3:36,0 --> 0:3:38,5



90
0:3:38,5 --> 0:3:42,7
The object here is that we want
an environment with as


91
0:3:42,7 --> 0:3:43,74
little friction as possible.


92
0:3:43,74 --> 0:3:45,94
So we're going to take the
flakes and just float them on


93
0:3:45,94 --> 0:3:49,13
the surface of the
water like this.


94
0:3:49,13 --> 0:3:52,43
Now watch what happens when we
get our magnet close to it.


95
0:3:52,43 --> 0:3:54,1
Let me stay away,
and watch what


96
0:3:54,1 --> 0:3:56,83
happens when we get close.


97
0:3:56,83 --> 0:4:1,96
Now, the skeptic will say that
you're blowing on the flake,


98
0:4:1,96 --> 0:4:3,24
but you're not.


99
0:4:3,24 --> 0:4:4,765
Look at this, let's see if I can
get this one and actually


100
0:4:4,765 --> 0:4:5,75
pull it over.


101
0:4:5,75 --> 0:4:6,93
Nice.


102
0:4:6,93 --> 0:4:10,69
So they're kind of ice skating
flakes, right, but it really


103
0:4:10,69 --> 0:4:11,605
is just water--


104
0:4:11,605 --> 0:4:13,94
I'll pull this one over
here as well--


105
0:4:13,94 --> 0:4:17,19
which must mean that there is
a little bit of iron, or at


106
0:4:17,19 --> 0:4:19,85
least the hypothesis would be
there's just a little bit of


107
0:4:19,85 --> 0:4:22,56
iron in each and every
one of those flakes.


108
0:4:22,56 --> 0:4:25,84
It's not conclusive proof,
but it is very cool.


109
0:4:25,84 --> 0:4:28,29
And the only way to really see
whether or not there's iron in


110
0:4:28,29 --> 0:4:31,77
Total cereal is either to take
it to a lab, or, maybe better,


111
0:4:31,77 --> 0:4:34,6
we could just get somebody to
eat a bowl of cereal, then we


112
0:4:34,6 --> 0:4:38,21
just remove the contents
of their stomach--


113
0:4:38,21 --> 0:4:39,48
I think I got a better way.


114
0:4:39,48 --> 0:4:42,56
We'll use a model.


115
0:4:42,56 --> 0:4:45,21
A Ziploc bag will be
perfect for this.


116
0:4:45,21 --> 0:4:48,21
So you're going to want a heavy
duty Ziploc bag, and the


117
0:4:48,21 --> 0:4:49,95
suggestion here is this.


118
0:4:49,95 --> 0:4:52,13
Open up the Ziploc bag, and
you're going to put about a


119
0:4:52,13 --> 0:4:54,438
cup of Total cereal
in the Ziploc bag.


120
0:4:54,438 --> 0:4:57,7



121
0:4:57,7 --> 0:4:59,47
Now they say on the side of
the package that a cup of


122
0:4:59,47 --> 0:5:1,89
cereal is equal to
one serving.


123
0:5:1,89 --> 0:5:5,31
And so I'm just going to
estimate that that's about a


124
0:5:5,31 --> 0:5:7,94
serving, one cup.


125
0:5:7,94 --> 0:5:11,12
The next part is we've got to
liquefy the cereal, so take


126
0:5:11,12 --> 0:5:13,65
water and fill the
bag with water.


127
0:5:13,65 --> 0:5:18,17
Probably half to three quarters
full with water seems


128
0:5:18,17 --> 0:5:19,19
to be just about right.


129
0:5:19,19 --> 0:5:21,1
If it doesn't work
for you, chances


130
0:5:21,1 --> 0:5:23,74
are it was too soup-like.


131
0:5:23,74 --> 0:5:27,12
You need to have it far more
runny, like water.


132
0:5:27,12 --> 0:5:29,3
Seal it up.


133
0:5:29,3 --> 0:5:31,95
Make sure there's a little bit
of air inside like this.


134
0:5:31,95 --> 0:5:34,66
And now, we just need
to shake it around.


135
0:5:34,66 --> 0:5:36,87
We're going to let it sit,
believe it or not, for a half


136
0:5:36,87 --> 0:5:40,9
hour to 45 minutes, because we
really want it to dissolve.


137
0:5:40,9 --> 0:5:42,36
Now you could crush the cereal
ahead of time, but I think the


138
0:5:42,36 --> 0:5:46,8
cleanest way to do it, and the
most conclusive way so people


139
0:5:46,8 --> 0:5:48,13
don't think that you've tampered
with it, is to just


140
0:5:48,13 --> 0:5:51,553
set it out here and let it
dissolve and come back to it


141
0:5:51,553 --> 0:5:54,89
in a half an hour
or 45 minutes.


142
0:5:54,89 --> 0:5:56,14
Otherwise, I'll just
keep on doing this.


143
0:5:56,14 --> 0:5:58,63



144
0:5:58,63 --> 0:6:1,4
There's a half an hour of my
life I'll never get back.


145
0:6:1,4 --> 0:6:3,88
Look, I got it to you the
way that it needs to be.


146
0:6:3,88 --> 0:6:4,95
Look at this.


147
0:6:4,95 --> 0:6:6,6
You want it soup-like.


148
0:6:6,6 --> 0:6:7,696
Fair enough?


149
0:6:7,696 --> 0:6:8,4
All right.


150
0:6:8,4 --> 0:6:9,62
So now you need the magnet.


151
0:6:9,62 --> 0:6:11,22
So here's the technique.


152
0:6:11,22 --> 0:6:14,7
Take the magnet, put it on your
hand, put the bag on top


153
0:6:14,7 --> 0:6:16,35
of the magnet like this.


154
0:6:16,35 --> 0:6:18,4
And now, shake it around.


155
0:6:18,4 --> 0:6:21,33
You're trying to make contact
with as much of the cereal as


156
0:6:21,33 --> 0:6:23,54
you can with that magnet.


157
0:6:23,54 --> 0:6:25,76
Notice how there's a little bit
of air in the bag as well,


158
0:6:25,76 --> 0:6:28,66
so that when we turn it over,
we can actually see what


159
0:6:28,66 --> 0:6:30,73
happens without it falling
back down.


160
0:6:30,73 --> 0:6:32,71
Turn the whole thing
upside down.


161
0:6:32,71 --> 0:6:34,86
And now what I'm going to do is
get in there with this so


162
0:6:34,86 --> 0:6:37,19
I'm not messing around
with it with my hand.


163
0:6:37,19 --> 0:6:39,2
Look at this.


164
0:6:39,2 --> 0:6:41,57
There's the iron in
the Total cereal.


165
0:6:41,57 --> 0:6:45,62
It's actually called "roughly
sheared ingot iron." This is


166
0:6:45,62 --> 0:6:49,3
food-grade metallic iron that
they put it in cereals, they


167
0:6:49,3 --> 0:6:52,13
put it in breads, they put
it in other foods.


168
0:6:52,13 --> 0:6:55,3
The FDA completely allows this,
and this is how they


169
0:6:55,3 --> 0:6:57,1
iron fortify a food.


170
0:6:57,1 --> 0:6:59,87
However, somebody who's much
smarter than I am said that


171
0:6:59,87 --> 0:7:2,27
you'd have to eat the
equivalent of--


172
0:7:2,27 --> 0:7:2,96
I don't know--


173
0:7:2,96 --> 0:7:7,57
4,000 or 5,000 boxes of Total
cereal during a given day to


174
0:7:7,57 --> 0:7:9,97
make enough iron to actually
produce a nail.


175
0:7:9,97 --> 0:7:12,77
So, I think you probably
already knew that.


176
0:7:12,77 --> 0:7:15,84
But, the idea is probably there,
and very, very cool.


177
0:7:15,84 --> 0:7:18,32
If you look at what you're
putting inside your body,


178
0:7:18,32 --> 0:7:21,18
there's a huge debate
over this iron.


179
0:7:21,18 --> 0:7:24,24
Is it good for you, number
one, and is it


180
0:7:24,24 --> 0:7:25,8
beneficial for you?


181
0:7:25,8 --> 0:7:27,21
Just because they put it
inside, is it truly


182
0:7:27,21 --> 0:7:28,41
beneficial.


183
0:7:28,41 --> 0:7:30,9
But most importantly, it's just
a lot of fun to sit here


184
0:7:30,9 --> 0:7:31,95
and to play with it.


185
0:7:31,95 --> 0:7:34,71
Most people don't know that you
can take the iron out of


186
0:7:34,71 --> 0:7:38,13
Total cereal, so it makes for
a very, very cool project.


187
0:7:38,13 --> 0:7:41,53
Now, if this is the only cereal
that you test, it's not


188
0:7:41,53 --> 0:7:43,74
a very good science
fair project.


189
0:7:43,74 --> 0:7:45,22
If you're looking for something
like this for a


190
0:7:45,22 --> 0:7:47,23
science fair project,
compare all of these


191
0:7:47,23 --> 0:7:48,37
cereals over here.


192
0:7:48,37 --> 0:7:51,17
As you take a look at the iron
level on all of these cereals,


193
0:7:51,17 --> 0:7:55,41
you can see that on some of
them, it's as low as 45% over


194
0:7:55,41 --> 0:7:59,82
here, and as high as 90% here
for like Shredded Wheat.


195
0:7:59,82 --> 0:8:1,93
The real debate, and the
feedback I'd like to hear from


196
0:8:1,93 --> 0:8:4,3
you is whether you think that's
beneficial for your


197
0:8:4,3 --> 0:8:6,97
body, but maybe more
importantly, can your body


198
0:8:6,97 --> 0:8:9,46
actually process this
reduced iron.


199
0:8:9,46 --> 0:8:13,71
It its raw, metallic form, does
your body process it and


200
0:8:13,71 --> 0:8:18,48
put it into a form that's usable
by your body for the


201
0:8:18,48 --> 0:8:19,64
iron that you need.


202
0:8:19,64 --> 0:8:22,18
It's the number one elemental
deficiency in the world.


203
0:8:22,18 --> 0:8:26,3
Women need four times the amount
of iron that men do.


204
0:8:26,3 --> 0:8:29,2
But it's just very, very cool
from a food science standpoint


205
0:8:29,2 --> 0:8:32,65
to see that this is how they
iron fortify our food.


206
0:8:32,65 --> 0:8:35,76
So when you were a kid and the
teacher said, play that game,


207
0:8:35,76 --> 0:8:37,269
magnetic or not.


208
0:8:37,269 --> 0:8:39,51
Like in second grade, you'd have
to go around and touch


209
0:8:39,51 --> 0:8:41,519
things that were magnetic or
not, and then everybody always


210
0:8:41,519 --> 0:8:43,167
ruined the TV, because
some dumb kid put


211
0:8:43,167 --> 0:8:45,14
it on the TV, and--


212
0:8:45,14 --> 0:8:46,38
hope that wasn't you.


213
0:8:46,38 --> 0:8:49,823
So money was the thing that they
always put down and say,


214
0:8:49,823 --> 0:8:51,31
is money magnetic or not.


215
0:8:51,31 --> 0:8:54,25
Well of course, in the United
States, it's not, in Canada


216
0:8:54,25 --> 0:8:56,24
firm, some of the money
is magnetic.


217
0:8:56,24 --> 0:8:58,66
But that's not necessarily
true.


218
0:8:58,66 --> 0:9:0,9
That dollar bill that
you see right there.


219
0:9:0,9 --> 0:9:2,3
Magnetic or not?


220
0:9:2,3 --> 0:9:4,4
Answer is, magnetic.


221
0:9:4,4 --> 0:9:5,37
And I'll show you how.


222
0:9:5,37 --> 0:9:8,22
Well we're back to our friend,
the neodymium magnet, and let


223
0:9:8,22 --> 0:9:11,2
me put it on the knife there,
so that we can get it close.


224
0:9:11,2 --> 0:9:11,77
Here, watch this.


225
0:9:11,77 --> 0:9:14,78
I'm going to lift up the
dollar bill like this.


226
0:9:14,78 --> 0:9:16,82
And watch what happens
as we get close.


227
0:9:16,82 --> 0:9:19,4
As you get close to
the dollar bill--


228
0:9:19,4 --> 0:9:21,332
no, it's not static
electricity--


229
0:9:21,332 --> 0:9:24,895
it's actually the iron that's
in the dollar bill.


230
0:9:24,895 --> 0:9:28,2
The iron is in the ink
of the dollar bill.


231
0:9:28,2 --> 0:9:29,73
And it's one of the ways they
tell whether or not the dollar


232
0:9:29,73 --> 0:9:30,68
bill is counterfeit.


233
0:9:30,68 --> 0:9:33,59
So, I'm told-- although I don't
know if this is true--


234
0:9:33,59 --> 0:9:36,3
that some of the vending
machines actually have an


235
0:9:36,3 --> 0:9:38,66
electromagnetic circuit in
there, so that if you put just


236
0:9:38,66 --> 0:9:41,47
a regular piece of paper or a
fake bill in and it doesn't


237
0:9:41,47 --> 0:9:44,32
sense the iron, then that's
when the alarm goes off.


238
0:9:44,32 --> 0:9:48,46
It could be just a myth, but
it kind of makes sense that


239
0:9:48,46 --> 0:9:50,29
there's iron there
in that ink.


240
0:9:50,29 --> 0:9:52,265
But is it the kind of iron
that you can actually


241
0:9:52,265 --> 0:9:53,9
pull out and see?


242
0:9:53,9 --> 0:9:54,81
Are there little
pieces of iron?


243
0:9:54,81 --> 0:9:57,35
Back to the trusty
blender we go.


244
0:9:57,35 --> 0:9:59,46
Oh, there you go, perfect.


245
0:9:59,46 --> 0:10:3,31
Once again, we are not going to
go to jail, because we're


246
0:10:3,31 --> 0:10:5,19
not going to try to
pass this money.


247
0:10:5,19 --> 0:10:7,25
We're going to grind it up, we
are going to destroy it.


248
0:10:7,25 --> 0:10:9,17
But we're not going to take
it and put it back into


249
0:10:9,17 --> 0:10:9,575
circulation.


250
0:10:9,575 --> 0:10:13,75
It's ours, and according to
the law, we can do this.


251
0:10:13,75 --> 0:10:14,1
Is that right?


252
0:10:14,1 --> 0:10:15,3
They said yes.


253
0:10:15,3 --> 0:10:15,54
Here we go.


254
0:10:15,54 --> 0:10:18,204
[BLENDING SOUND]


255
0:10:18,204 --> 0:10:20,67
Now the problem with this is
you're to really going to


256
0:10:20,67 --> 0:10:24,838
grind it up, so if I were
you, I would just


257
0:10:24,838 --> 0:10:26,88
kind of let it go.


258
0:10:26,88 --> 0:10:31,74



259
0:10:31,74 --> 0:10:33,14
Not really much you
can do right now.


260
0:10:33,14 --> 0:10:34,61
You're just going to have
to grind it up.


261
0:10:34,61 --> 0:10:37,64



262
0:10:37,64 --> 0:10:41,34
What we're trying to do is to
rip the fibers of this apart.


263
0:10:41,34 --> 0:10:43,72
You will never be able to use
this blender for food again.


264
0:10:43,72 --> 0:10:45,44
It's just too gross, right.


265
0:10:45,44 --> 0:10:48,4
But this is exactly what
you want to see inside.


266
0:10:48,4 --> 0:10:50,84
See how it's ground up and
it's almost held in


267
0:10:50,84 --> 0:10:51,73
suspension.


268
0:10:51,73 --> 0:10:54,7
And now it goes into
the Ziploc bag.


269
0:10:54,7 --> 0:10:56,3
This is just disgusting
if you think about


270
0:10:56,3 --> 0:10:57,24
how dirty money is.


271
0:10:57,24 --> 0:10:59,93
All right, the money goes
into here like this.


272
0:10:59,93 --> 0:11:1,5
Try to get all of it.


273
0:11:1,5 --> 0:11:3,18
Hopefully there's not
much left over.


274
0:11:3,18 --> 0:11:4,12
Good.


275
0:11:4,12 --> 0:11:5,56
And now seal it up.


276
0:11:5,56 --> 0:11:8,32
Treat it just like you did the
Total cereal for "Eating Nails


277
0:11:8,32 --> 0:11:9,38
for Breakfast."


278
0:11:9,38 --> 0:11:12,18
Now we're going to take our
neodymium magnet and put it on


279
0:11:12,18 --> 0:11:15,51
top here, turn it upside
down, rock it around.


280
0:11:15,51 --> 0:11:16,57
Take a look at this here.


281
0:11:16,57 --> 0:11:17,47
Oh, this looks great.


282
0:11:17,47 --> 0:11:18,9
Take a look at this, watch.


283
0:11:18,9 --> 0:11:22,68
Here is the iron in
your dollar bill.


284
0:11:22,68 --> 0:11:24,63
It's more impressive than
the Total cereal.


285
0:11:24,63 --> 0:11:25,94
Look at this.


286
0:11:25,94 --> 0:11:30,78
The iron in the ink is fairly
easy to be able to pull out.


287
0:11:30,78 --> 0:11:32,72
The question always comes up,
does it only work with a


288
0:11:32,72 --> 0:11:33,45
dollar bill.


289
0:11:33,45 --> 0:11:35,66
And I have no idea.


290
0:11:35,66 --> 0:11:39,84
So, as a response video, go
ahead and try it with $5 or


291
0:11:39,84 --> 0:11:43,49
$10, o $20, or maybe some of
you wealthy ones out there,


292
0:11:43,49 --> 0:11:45,86
try it with a hundred dollar
bill, post the response there.


293
0:11:45,86 --> 0:11:47,92
Of course we will not
make fun of you.


294
0:11:47,92 --> 0:11:51,3
All in scientific inquiry.


295
0:11:51,3 --> 0:11:52,75
Just stick with a dollar.


296
0:11:52,75 --> 0:11:55,415
And when you're all done, get
yourself a gallon of Clorox


297
0:11:55,415 --> 0:11:58,6
and more hand sanitizer then
you could ever imagine,


298
0:11:58,6 --> 0:11:59,945
because you've got
to clean up.


299
0:11:59,945 --> 0:12:1,195
This is disgusting.
