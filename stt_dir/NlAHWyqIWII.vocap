###7 VITO ACCONCI: I remember being tremendously jolted the first
###10 time I saw a Jasper Johns painting.
###15 And it seemed like, wow, conventions are important.
###21 It's as if Jasper Johns really wanted to do all these little
###23 abstract brush strokes, but he said, why
###26 would anybody pay attention?
###28 However, if I make a number five, you can't help pay
###31 attention-- if you make a target.
###33 It's a way to draw people in, which made me think in terms
###37 of English.
###39 English language idioms--
###41 can you play with words?
###43 The great thing about words is that they seem so definite,
###46 but they're so hazy and cloudy.
###50 You can pick one word within a word and it starts to
###53 contradict the basic word.
###56 I don't want to do something that refers to
###59 something off the page.
###60 Towards the end of the time I was writing, I started to
###64 think, I can't use words like "tree," "chair." This refers
###70 to a space off the page, whereas I could use, on the
###73 page, words like "there," "then," "at that time," "in
###77 that space," "in that place"--
###79 words that directly referred to my act of writing the page,
###84 words that referred to the reader's act of
###87 going down the page.
###88 They were almost like guides for the reader.
###92 Though, eventually--
###92 one of the last poems I wrote was a poem consisting of a
###99 page on reading speed--
###101 how to improve reading speed.
###103 The title given to it was something like "The Time Taken
###107 For Me to Walk From 14th Street and 6th Avenue to 14th
###111 Street and 5th Avenue"--
###113 so an attempt to make reading time
###115 equivalent to writing time.
###117 By the time I got there, I thought, I can't turn back.
###121 The stuff has taken me out to the street.
###123 And also, I started to question, if I'm so interested
###126 in space and moving over a space, why am I moving over an
###130 8 and 1/2 by 11 piece of paper?
###132 There's a floor out there.
###134 There's a street out there.
###135 There's a world out there.
###137 What can I do on the street?
###139 Follow a person.
###140 What I thought of as activities--
###142 they weren't exactly performances.
###144 There wasn't a viewer.
###145 If anything, I was the viewer.
###148 I used what was available.
###150 I started to use a Super 8 camera--
###152 later, a video camera.
###154 I was very struck by a beautiful Charlie Chaplin
###158 statement when he was asked, why didn't he ever use a close
###163 up in his comedies?
###165 And his answer was, well, there's just nothing funny
###168 about a face 15 feet high, which changed my life.
###173 And then I realized, but video is a place--
###177 a video monitor, a video screen, at least then, was
###180 approximately the size of a person's face.
###183 So the way I did videos was my face on screen, face
###187 to face with you--
###188 I have to assume somebody's going to watch it--
###190 with you offscreen.
###192 What am I doing in relation to you?
###194 First of all, where am I?
###195 Am I face to face with you?
###197 And in this case, I'm on the floor.
###199 I'm either a pet cat or a snake.
###201 [MUSIC PLAYING FROM VIDEO]
###204 No, I don't need your picture.
###207 I don't have to know what you look like.
###210 We haven't even said hello yet.
###213 You can look like anybody.
###214 I'll take anybody.
###216 I'll take anything I can get.
###221 Some of the videos I did before this--
###223 I was really struck by the--
###225 sorry, I can't say I stole this from these movies.
###229 But it was '72, '73, a great Bob Rafelson movie called
###235 "King of Marvin Gardens."
###237 It begins with black and Jack Nicholson's face leaning into
###240 the screen, and direct confrontation.
###244 That was important to me.
###245 Though, I had done stuff before that, I guess.
###248 But actually, I think a lot of the face-to-face video stuff I
###252 did was really not until '73.
###255 So I think I got it from "King of Marvin Gardens."
###261 -People always say about you that, at some point, you
###263 turned your back on the art world.
###266 VITO ACCONCI: To me, the shorthand to the time is the
###269 music of the time.
###271 In the late '60s, early '70s, I was listening to Neil Young,
###276 Van Morrison--
###278 single voice, long song.
###281 There was something else going on in the music.
###283 The introduction of the Velvet Underground was like the
###286 introduction of the city in the middle of what, in effect,
###290 was rural music, country music.
###292 You have all the time in the world to wander.
###294 But Velvet Underground was the city's closing in on you.
###298 So by the mid '70s, I was listening to a
###300 different kind of music.
###301 I was listening to the Ramones, the Sex Pistols.
###304 
###307 No longer single voice, no longer long song, because a
###312 scream can't last for six minutes.
###315 It started to become clear to me that my stuff is so
###321 grounded on the '60s.
###323 It's so grounded on a time in which the common language is
###329 finding oneself, as if the self is something that you
###334 separate from the rest of the person and concentrate on and
###338 contemplate.
###339 [UNINTELLIGIBLE SOUNDS]
###341 
###343 VITO ACCONCI: I've never loved galleries.
###345 I've never particularly loved museums.
###349 But have I turned my back?
###350 I don't know, it's an interesting--
###352 I think I don't feel a connection to the art world.
###358 But I always had questions about the art
###360 world, even when I started.
###363 I come from a generation who had the illusion that we were
###367 going to do the kind of work that would make galleries go
###371 out of existence.
###372 We were very naive.
###373 And also, in some ways, a lot of us were right.
###375 We didn't make commodities, so we always had a
###377 difficult time surviving.
###378 By '73, '74, '75, I and a lot of other people were starting
###383 to have very different notions of self.
###385 Self wasn't this precious jewel that you found and
###390 focused on.
###392 Self maybe existed only as part of a social system, a
###397 cultural system, a political system.
###400 By the mid '70s, I wanted stuff of mine to be part of
###403 those overall systems.
###404 In other words, I thought, is my stuff inherently
###407 self-enclosed?
###409 Yes, it was me and you.
###412 But what about we?
###414 Once I did "Seedbed" in '72, I started to realize it's not
###419 the '60s anymore.
###420 I might have masturbated in a gallery in 1972.
###423 People were fucking in the streets in 1965.
###427 Art is a little slow.
###429 
###431 Luckily, life is faster.
###432 
###439 Our first goal is really not to build.
###442 Our first goal is, can we come up with a design, can we
###447 design a space, can we design a condition that
###451 will surprise us?
###452 An attempt we made a few years ago to propose a new light
###455 system for New York--
###457 the competition brief said that the new light system
###460 should have a very thick post, because the post would have to
###464 hold different kinds of lights,
###466 different kinds of signs.
###468 We thought this was probably misguided since you wouldn't
###470 need all those different kinds of lights, all those different
###473 kinds of signs, all the time.
###475 Let's take the opposite approach.
###477 Let's use the thinnest pole possible.
###481 Then, each pole would hold one kind of
###483 light, one kind of sign.
###485 The more you needed then, you would braid them together.
###489 You would braid each one sign, one light post together so you
###495 could have multiple lights at posts.
###497 Needless to say, the new light system is exactly the same as
###500 the old one.
###501 We, like a lot of people, made a kind of attempt at a
###506 possible new World Trade Center.
###510 We proposed a World Trade Center full of holes.
###513 Our starting point was that if a building nowadays is going
###516 to be exploded anyway, maybe a building nowadays should come
###519 already exploded.
###520 It should come pre-exploded.
###523 So we take the original site of the World Trade Center,
###526 extrude it to a height of 110 stories high--
###529 more of a mass, more of a volume than the original World
###532 Trade Center ever was, more private office space than
###535 anybody could possibly need so we could shoot cones into it.
###539 Now that the building is riddled with holes, it can
###542 possibly act as a kind of urban camouflage.
###545 A terrorist flying by above looks down and says, we don't
###549 have to bother about this building.
###550 It's already been dealt with.
###552 Now that the building is riddled with holes, there are
###556 now tunnels from one side to another, tunnels
###559 from bottom to top.
###560 Now that there are tunnels through the building, the rest
###563 of the building can come inside.
###564 Parks can come inside the building.
###567 Street vendors can come inside the building.
###569 In other words, instead of trying to observe the
###571 convention of private office building with so-called public
###575 space outside, can we mix public and private?
###578 Which, I think, our projects, at least when they work,
###581 always try to do.
###583 This is paradoxical maybe, but even though we build far from
###587 everything we do, we do think it's necessary to build,
###590 because you have to build in order to test the theory.
###595 And the only way you can test the theory is what happens
###597 when other people come in.
###599 
###608 I got a lot of my ideas of architecture from "Blade
###611 Runner." "Blade Runner" was so startling to me.
###615 This contradicted the 2001 notion of architecture.
###619 The future is abstract and all white.
###622 The "Blade Runner" notion shrugged its shoulders and
###624 said, we're never going to have enough money to build
###627 from the beginning.
###628 Let's just tack on to what's already there.
###631 And again, it made a kind of sense.
###635 So our first goal is to do something that surprises us.
###640 And hopefully, if it surprises us, maybe it can surprise and
###645 excite at least one other person.
###650 Graz, for example--
###652 we always made the assumption that probably there's a chance
###656 that younger people like our work.
###659 I don't think we have much of a chance with older people.
###661 But that's OK.
###664 It's a way that I can maybe pretend that
###668 I'm not getting older.
###669 When the Graz island was finished, people in Graz
###672 started to use the island as a place for walks.
###676 And a lot of old people were walking on the island.
###679 I was really surprised.
###682 The interesting thing, when somebody was in the theater--
###686 and especially, I remember, this happened a
###688 lot with older people.
###689 They're in the theater.
###691 They're walking.
###692 Suddenly, they look up and around, and
###694 they started to laugh.
###697 It seemed like, well, maybe they kind of got
###700 the feeling of it.
###701 They were in this open space.
###704 Now, without realizing it, without going through an
###707 entrance, it became a more closed space.
###711 And even though we couldn't use the same language, people
###715 came up to us and thanked us.
###717 There was a peace tree named after us.
###719 Now, I don't know if I can say that's totally a sign, but it
###723 seemed like--
###726 What we were asked to do was this person-made island that
###729 would have three functions-- a theater, a cafe, and a
###733 playground.
###734 So we started with the
###735 conventional idea of a theater--
###737 a bowl.
###738 What if we twist the bowl?
###740 What if we turn it upside down?
###741 Bowl becomes dome.
###743 Dome becomes the cafe.
###745 The twisting, warping space in between becomes the
###749 playground.
###750 You walk in under a canopy that twists down to make
###755 lounge seating around the cafe.
###758 Our bar twists down to make a number of bar counters.
###762 The reason for the number of bar counters is that when we
###765 design a project, we try to envision what can happen here.
###769 This is a bar.
###770 Somebody's drunk.
###772 Whenever this person extends his or her hand, they might
###774 hit a bar counter, at least they have some chance.
###777 I always say, yes, we give people a place to use.
###781 If we put a couple of folding chairs there, would it have
###784 done the same thing?
###786 I hope we provide more than a folding chair.
###788 We provide a folding chair with a twist.
###791 Does everybody want that?
###792 I hope--
###794 maybe everybody doesn't want it.
###796 Do we want something that everybody wants?
###798 I guess we want to appeal to people who think that, wow, I
###802 didn't know space didn't have to be implacable and fixed.
###807 Now that I've been in this space, maybe I can turn my
###810 space upside down.
###811 Maybe I can twist my space.
###813 I admit, do we want to appeal to everybody?
###817 No.
###817 We want to appeal to people who want a second
###821 chance, want a future.
###824 
###828 I got so excited with the notion of a computer-oriented
###834 time, because it seems like everybody has things
###839 in their own hands.
###841 So it seems this should be the most optimistic time ever.
###846 Ideally, we want to do stuff that couldn't have been built,
###852 couldn't have been designed, ideally, couldn't even have
###854 been dreamt of before the 21st century.
###857 We don't do that.
###858 But we wish could.
###860 We try.
###861 We wanted to make a system that possibly
###863 could adapt to people.
###866 Could people change the system they're in?
###869 This is a project we're doing in Indianapolis.
###872 The street goes through a building.
###875 When people go through it, there's a structure of LED
###879 lights that follow you and swarm around you.
###884 They're not exactly swarming around you.
###887 It's an on and off system.
###889 But we wanted to make this system that would be almost
###891 like fire flies.
###893 So fire flies would follow you.
###895 If another one person comes, the fire
###897 flies start to mingle.
###901 Can it be done?
###901 Yes.
###903 Can it be done for a $600,000 budget?
###906 We're not sure yet, but we think it can.
###908 But we've been working on a number of projects
###912 that adjust to people.
###915 This is a proposal that won this competition for a
###918 sculpture park in Bernau in the Czech Republic.
###921 But whether it'll actually happen is another matter.
###924 We wanted to fill the space with these almost fake grass,
###931 fake bamboo.
###932 It would be fibers.
###934 As soon as a person walks, when a person comes close, the
###937 fibers start to part.
###939 The fibers part to let you through.
###942 This notion of things parting, adjusting to people, is
###946 something we've tried a number of versions.
###949 We did a tattoo based on this system that--
###952 actually, one or two actual tattoos exist.
###955 A person would pick out the imperfections
###958 on his or her body.
###960 And then we would make a kind of magnetic field system.
###964 One mole calls to the other.
###968 And we're wondering if we can make a clothing
###971 system out of this.
###972 You pick five points on the body--
###974 two nipples, a belly button, and a vagina.
###977 Can one draw the other and you make this
###980 kind of field system?
###981 Ideally, you can build a city on this magnetic field system.
###988 But I don't know how far we've gotten.
###990 There are a number of architects, certainly not just
###993 us, who are trying to do things according to principles
###997 of biology.
###999 Right now, it seems to be only a metaphor.
###1003 Yes, I can say, here's a magnetic field system.
###1007 Yeah, maybe you can use that as a system of design, but
###1011 it's not going to move in the future.
###1014 Maybe it will.
###1015 But certainly not as we've done.
###1018 It's more of a design method, where it should be a real
###1022 growth method.
###1024 We haven't figured out how to do it yet.
###1027 But at the same time, I don't want to say that this isn't
###1029 possible in the future.
###1032 It's certainly not possible now.
###1034 Or maybe I even have to say more validly that we haven't
###1037 found a way to make what we really want happen.
###1042 But I can't say that, amongst some of those architects that
###1045 we admire, somebody might have discovered it.
###1047 We don't know about it yet.
###1049 
###1057 Right now, we listen to electronic music, Japanese
###1060 noise music--
###1062 no voice.
###1063 We want music to be as--
###1064 I think music and architecture are exactly the same.
###1067 Not exactly the same, but they're at least analagous.
###1072 Both music and architecture make a surrounding.
###1076 They make an ambiance.
###1077 But also, both music and architecture allow you to do
###1081 something else-- something else while listening to music,
###1084 something else while in the middle of architecture.
###1087 To me, that's probably the keynote of the 21st century.
###1091 Like, I think, a lot of architects now, I think what
###1093 we really want is, can we make a place you take with you?
###1096 A little fashion magazine called "The Black Book" a few
###1100 years ago proposed to us that the umbrella hasn't been
###1104 redesigned in years.
###1105 Could we try our hand at an alternate umbrella?
###1111 We started with the idea of ruffles in clothing.
###1114 So what we did was make a kind of "umbruffla," combining
###1118 umbrella and ruffles.
###1120 It's made of two-way mirrored mylar, so when you're wearing
###1124 it, because of the change of light, you can see out.
###1127 But from outside, you just see the reflections of city.
###1130 So it acts as a camouflage system.
###1132 Our umbrella has some advantages over the
###1135 conventional umbrella.
###1136 You can tie one end to your waist, one end to your wrist
###1139 so your hands are free.
###1142 You can wrap it around you like a kind of cloak.
###1147 If another umbrella is coming towards you, you don't have to
###1149 bump umbrellas.
###1150 You can wrap it around yourself.
###1152 It's an umbrella that two people can use, so you can
###1154 wrap another person up with you.
###1157 Then, the ruffles system, if we do it well enough, will
###1160 allow it to fold down.
###1162 Ideally, it should fold into the size of a wrist.
###1165 I've always been told I'm a kind of incurable optimist.
###1169 I'm a curable optimist at the same time, being an amazing
###1172 depressive.
###1174 Yes, computer has all these kinds of possibilities.
###1177 Religion and belief is the opposite.
###1179 I can't necessarily say that religion and belief isn't
###1181 going to win.
###1183 I would be very optimistic if I could be convinced that
###1188 everybody wanted to leave home, but I'm afraid a lot of
###1191 people want to go back home.
###1194 And going back home, I think, is wanting something that you
###1197 can be sure of, something that you can believe, and also
###1201 something that you can keep other people out of.
###1205 And that's scary.
###1207 With--
###1208 not just an instrument, but the computer is a network of
###1211 instruments.
###1212 With a network of instruments so vast, it seems like, can
###1217 Homeland Security ultimately win?
###1220 I really don't think it can.
###1221 I might not be around to see it.
###1223 What I want to believe, or believe, is that-- and this
###1227 has something to do with what I was saying about the kind of
###1230 stuff we really want to do is the kind of place
###1234 you carry with you.
###1235 Maybe the future is a world where people carry their own
###1240 homes with them, where they never have to go home.
###1243 There are no boundaries to cross.
###1246 It's a world of nomads.
###1247 A world of nomads can be an incredibly exciting world, but
###1252 it's the opposite of home.
###1254
