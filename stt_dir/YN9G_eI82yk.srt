CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: Mondays, not awesome.
But getting on CNN STUDENT NEWS definitely


2
0:0:5,95 --> 0:0:19,599
is. And today we`re going to tell you how
you can make it happen. I`m Carl Azuz. Let`s


3
0:0:19,599 --> 0:0:24,539
go!


4
0:0:24,539 --> 0:0:28,869
First up today, we are talking about violence
in Afghanistan. Suicide bombings, three of


5
0:0:28,869 --> 0:0:33,86
them, all of them targeting a U.S. Afghan
base in the eastern part of the country. Officials


6
0:0:33,86 --> 0:0:39,14
say at least three Afghan soldiers and two
civilians were killed. The Taliban, the militant


7
0:0:39,14 --> 0:0:44,8
group that used to control most of Afghanistan
says it`s responsible for these attacks. They


8
0:0:44,8 --> 0:0:49,94
happened earlier Sunday morning before sunrise.
Afghan authorities say all nine of the attackers


9
0:0:49,94 --> 0:0:55,3
were killed, either in the bombings or in
the firefight with U.S. and Afghan troops


10
0:0:55,3 --> 0:0:59,53
that happened afterward. This isn`t the first
time that the base has been targeted by suicide


11
0:0:59,53 --> 0:1:4,939
bombings. It`s located in a region that`s
home to a lot of insurgent activity.


12
0:1:4,939 --> 0:1:9,69
Next up today, we`re looking at the political
unrest in Egypt. An elected assembly has drafted


13
0:1:9,69 --> 0:1:15,32
a new constitution, but only after more moderate
members of that assembly left, complaining


14
0:1:15,32 --> 0:1:20,6
they weren`t being heard. On Saturday, the
assembly turned over the draft to President


15
0:1:20,6 --> 0:1:25,62
Mohamed Morsi. That`s him on the right, he
said there`ll be a referendum, a vote on December


16
0:1:25,62 --> 0:1:30,94
15th. After that announcement protests broke
out, some from people who support President


17
0:1:30,94 --> 0:1:35,17
Morsi, some from people who think he`s trying
to give himself too much power.


18
0:1:35,17 --> 0:1:40,31
Egypt`s Supreme Court was planning to review
the constitution, but some of Morsi`s supporters


19
0:1:40,31 --> 0:1:45,26
gathered outside the court building. The court
canceled its sessions indefinitely. It said


20
0:1:45,26 --> 0:1:51,31
judges won`t go back to work until they can
do their jobs without "any psychological or


21
0:1:51,31 --> 0:1:52,229
physical pressures."


22
0:1:52,229 --> 0:1:54,34
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


23
0:1:54,34 --> 0:2:0,2
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Just the facts: Parkinson`s
disease is a disorder of the human nervous


24
0:2:0,2 --> 0:2:5,72
system. Unintentional shaking may be the most
well-known sign of Parkinson`s. But it can


25
0:2:5,72 --> 0:2:11,76
also cause stiffness or slower movements.
It can affect someone`s balance or speech.


26
0:2:11,76 --> 0:2:16,73
Doctors don`t know what causes Parkinson`s
disease and there`s no cure for it. But medications


27
0:2:16,73 --> 0:2:19,1
can help improve its symptoms.


28
0:2:19,1 --> 0:2:21,15
(END VIDEO CLIP)


29
0:2:21,15 --> 0:2:27,98
AZUZ: All right, so we don`t know what causes
Parkinson`s. we do know about 4 million people


30
0:2:27,98 --> 0:2:33,41
worldwide have it, and tens of thousands of
new cases are diagnosed every year. Now, there


31
0:2:33,41 --> 0:2:38,27
is a man who says he`s found a new way to
make that diagnosis. Normally when something


32
0:2:38,27 --> 0:2:43,0
is wrong, you go to a doctor. In this case,
you might not even have to be in the room.


33
0:2:43,0 --> 0:2:45,38
Dr. Sanjay Gupta explains what we mean.


34
0:2:45,38 --> 0:2:46,54
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


35
0:2:46,54 --> 0:2:52,959
DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Max Little
has a bold idea -- what if doctors could detect


36
0:2:52,959 --> 0:2:56,36
Parkinson`s disease simply by the sound of
your voice?


37
0:2:56,36 --> 0:2:57,51
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: A-a-a ....


38
0:2:57,51 --> 0:2:58,66
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A-a-a ...


39
0:2:58,66 --> 0:3:4,4
GUPTA: Max Little is close to proving just
that. He says one simple voice test will determine


40
0:3:4,4 --> 0:3:7,68
if someone has Parkinson`s. And all you need
is a telephone.


41
0:3:7,68 --> 0:3:13,27
MAX LITTLE, MATHEMATICIAN: We`ve got an ultra
low-cost way of detecting the disease.


42
0:3:13,27 --> 0:3:20,319
GUPTA: What makes this discovery even more
incredible, Max isn`t a doctor. He is a mathematician.


43
0:3:20,319 --> 0:3:25,92
LITTLE: My name is Max Little, and for a living
I do applied mathematics.


44
0:3:25,92 --> 0:3:33,97
GUPTA (on camera): So, just in terms of the
process, if someone picks up the phone and


45
0:3:33,97 --> 0:3:35,4
calls, what are they told to do?


46
0:3:35,4 --> 0:3:41,19
LITTLE: So, we`ve set up a study called Parkinson`s
Voice Initiative. And the idea with that study


47
0:3:41,19 --> 0:3:47,91
is that we want to collect enough data that
we can test this technology outside the lab,


48
0:3:47,91 --> 0:3:53,72
so we are collecting recordings from people
in all sorts of circumstances that we can`t


49
0:3:53,72 --> 0:3:54,14
control.


50
0:3:54,14 --> 0:3:58,78
And we want to then test our ability to be
able to, you know, accurately detect whether


51
0:3:58,78 --> 0:4:4,92
they have Parkinson`s disease or not. In lab-
based studies we can get 99 percent detection


52
0:4:4,92 --> 0:4:11,209
accuracy. But can we get that sort of accuracy
over the telephone when we don`t have that


53
0:4:11,209 --> 0:4:12,879
sort of controlled circumstances. That`s why
we need to do the study.


54
0:4:12,879 --> 0:4:13,2
GUPTA: 99 percent though?


55
0:4:13,2 --> 0:4:15,569
LITTLE: Yeah. Yeah. That`s the overall accuracy.
Yeah.


56
0:4:15,569 --> 0:4:23,29
In this case, what will happen is that people
will call in, they simply say whether or not


57
0:4:23,29 --> 0:4:27,4
they have been diagnosed with Parkinson`s.
And then they -- we just ask them to say A--a-a


58
0:4:27,4 --> 0:4:28,8
for as long as they can.


59
0:4:28,8 --> 0:4:29,61
GUPTA: That`s it?


60
0:4:29,61 --> 0:4:30,15
LITTLE: Yeah.


61
0:4:30,15 --> 0:4:32,43
GUPTA: It sounds so remarkably simple.


62
0:4:32,43 --> 0:4:35,389
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A-a-a -a-a ...


63
0:4:35,389 --> 0:4:39,55
GUPTA: So, what do you hear there?


64
0:4:39,55 --> 0:4:44,37
LITTLE: Yes, that`s a classic example of vocal
tremor. You can actually hear the tremor in


65
0:4:44,37 --> 0:4:48,949
the way that the vocal folds, the laringia
muscles are twitching somewhere.


66
0:4:48,949 --> 0:4:50,77
And that affects the pitch.


67
0:4:50,77 --> 0:4:55,56
GUPTA: So, the same soft of tremor that you
have in your hands, your arms -- you`re saying


68
0:4:55,56 --> 0:4:58,71
that`s basically happening around in the muscles
around your vocal cords.


69
0:4:58,71 --> 0:5:0,6
LITTLE: That`s right. Yeah.


70
0:5:0,6 --> 0:5:1,55
(END VIDEOTAPE)


71
0:5:1,55 --> 0:5:2,97
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


72
0:5:2,97 --> 0:5:7,38
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Today`s "Shoutout" goes
out to Mr. Osborn`s economics and history


73
0:5:7,38 --> 0:5:12,18
classes at Creswell High School in Creswell,
Oregon.


74
0:5:12,18 --> 0:5:18,5
Which of these bodies of water is the largest?
Here we go. Is it the Persian Gulf, Black


75
0:5:18,5 --> 0:5:27,6
Sea, Gulf of Mexico or Lake Superior? You`ve
got three seconds, go!


76
0:5:27,6 --> 0:5:34,86
The Gulf of Mexico is the biggest option here
covering an area of around 600,000 square


77
0:5:34,86 --> 0:5:40,2
miles. That`s your answer and that`s your
"Shoutout."


78
0:5:40,2 --> 0:5:41,96
(END VIDEO CLIP)


79
0:5:41,96 --> 0:5:46,759
AZUZ: Part of that massive area of the Gulf
of Mexico is now a crime scene in a real life


80
0:5:46,759 --> 0:5:51,8
mystery. Authorities in Louisiana, Alabama
and Mississippi are trying to find a killer


81
0:5:51,8 --> 0:5:57,139
-- but not somebody who is targeting people:
Ed Lavandera tells us what animals have become


82
0:5:57,139 --> 0:6:1,7
targets and what makes it so difficult to
investigate their murders.


83
0:6:1,7 --> 0:6:1,78
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


84
0:6:1,78 --> 0:6:6,289
ED LAVANDERA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: To reach
the crime scenes, you need to catch a ride


85
0:6:6,289 --> 0:6:6,979
and take a guide.


86
0:6:6,979 --> 0:6:9,69
In this island that we see (inaudible), this
is Dear Island, where you found two of them?


87
0:6:9,69 --> 0:6:11,289
DR. MOBY SOLANGI, INSTITUTE FOR MARINE MAMMAL
STUDIES: That`s correct.


88
0:6:11,289 --> 0:6:15,729
LAVANDERA (voice over): A Harrison County
Mississippi sheriff`s chopper and Moby Solangi,


89
0:6:15,729 --> 0:6:20,43
the lead biologist from the Institute for
Marine Mammal Studies. They took us to see


90
0:6:20,43 --> 0:6:25,27
the sites where most of the murdered dolphins
have mysteriously emerged along the Mississippi


91
0:6:25,27 --> 0:6:25,83
Gulf Coast.


92
0:6:25,83 --> 0:6:30,99
(on camera): So, Moby, get us up to date how
many dolphins have turned up here so far?


93
0:6:30,99 --> 0:6:35,47
SOLANGI: We`ve been dealing with about six
or seven. We know that these three or four


94
0:6:35,47 --> 0:6:37,84
of them have been found dead with bullets.


95
0:6:37,84 --> 0:6:41,63
LAVANDERA (voice over): Federal investigators
say they don`t know yet if the murders are


96
0:6:41,63 --> 0:6:47,6
the work of one dolphin killer or all unrelated,
but even in the wild, it`s easy for a killer


97
0:6:47,6 --> 0:6:51,6
to lure in dolphins.


98
0:6:51,6 --> 0:6:54,85
Katherine Burton trains dolphins at the Institute
for Marine Mammal Studies.


99
0:6:54,85 --> 0:6:59,18
KATHERINE BURTON, MAMMAL TRAINER: They are
very curious, and I think by getting fed ...


100
0:6:59,18 --> 0:7:0,78
LAVANDERA (on camera): Even out in the wild.


101
0:7:0,78 --> 0:7:2,22
BURTON: Yes. Out in the wild, they will get
fairly close.


102
0:7:2,22 --> 0:7:5,819
LAVANDERA: So they can get themselves in the
bad situation just unsuspecting.


103
0:7:5,819 --> 0:7:11,9
BURTON: Right. I think sometimes they get
close without realizing they are going to


104
0:7:11,9 --> 0:7:12,88
be in any kind of danger.


105
0:7:12,88 --> 0:7:16,55
LAVANDERA (voice over): That`s why it`s actually
illegal to feed dolphins in the wild.


106
0:7:16,55 --> 0:7:18,87
(on camera): So, this is Sheep Island where
one of the dolphins was found?


107
0:7:18,87 --> 0:7:18,99
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right.


108
0:7:18,99 --> 0:7:22,93
LAVANDERA (voice over): Rusty Pittman is an
officer with Mississippi`s Department of Marine


109
0:7:22,93 --> 0:7:25,56
Resources, one of the agencies patrolling
these waters.


110
0:7:25,56 --> 0:7:29,419
(on camera): It seems so much more difficult
to investigate something like this. You know,


111
0:7:29,419 --> 0:7:32,229
if you have a murder of humans, you have ...


112
0:7:32,229 --> 0:7:33,479
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Evidence .


113
0:7:33,479 --> 0:7:34,18
LAVANDERA: You have evidence, there is a crime
scene.


114
0:7:34,18 --> 0:7:34,919
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right.


115
0:7:34,919 --> 0:7:35,66
There`s you go.


116
0:7:35,66 --> 0:7:36,83
LAVANDERA: This crime scene is huge.


117
0:7:36,83 --> 0:7:41,58
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But like you said, you`ve
got so much area through here. This is totally


118
0:7:41,58 --> 0:7:44,66
different than a crime scene involving humans.


119
0:7:44,66 --> 0:7:48,18
LAVANDERA (voice over): This part of the Gulf
Coast is home to the largest population of


120
0:7:48,18 --> 0:7:54,9
dolphins anywhere in the United States, as
many as 5,000. The race is on to catch a dolphin


121
0:7:54,9 --> 0:7:55,9
killer before he strikes again.


122
0:7:55,9 --> 0:7:58,68
Ed Lavandera, CNN, Gulfport, Mississippi.


123
0:7:58,68 --> 0:7:59,789
(END VIDEOTAPE)


124
0:7:59,789 --> 0:8:3,759
AZUZ: The season of giving is about more than
presents. From now through the holidays, people


125
0:8:3,759 --> 0:8:8,12
are finding ways to volunteer, to give back,
to make a difference for others. If you are


126
0:8:8,12 --> 0:8:12,25
doing this, we want to hear about it in an
I-report, you`ve got to give it in by December


127
0:8:12,25 --> 0:8:16,5
14th. And if you are wondering how do I send
in an I-report, we are glad you asked.


128
0:8:16,5 --> 0:8:20,97
CHRIS LETT, CNN RESEARCHER: So, you want to
be on CNN STUDENT NEWS? Me too. I`ll show


129
0:8:20,97 --> 0:8:25,729
you how by submitting an I-report video. So
let`s see what assignments are up on our CNN


130
0:8:25,729 --> 0:8:32,44
STUDENT NEWS I-report page. I- report.com/cnnstudentnews.
We are going to do an I-report on how to submit


131
0:8:32,44 --> 0:8:35,409
an I-report. Let`s get a camera and start
rolling.


132
0:8:35,409 --> 0:8:40,36
No, I know I need to keep this short. No more
than 30 seconds, and I can`t use any music.


133
0:8:40,36 --> 0:8:43,989
If I do, they won`t be able to use my I-report.


134
0:8:43,989 --> 0:8:46,429
So, just me and the camera.


135
0:8:46,429 --> 0:8:51,19
Hi, I`m Chris. And this is an I-Report about
I-Reports.


136
0:8:51,19 --> 0:8:54,91
OK, done shooting now, it`s back to the STUDENT
NEWS, I-Report page.


137
0:8:54,91 --> 0:8:58,91
Upload my story, fill out all the information
and now I`m done. No way, I`m not.


138
0:8:58,91 --> 0:9:3,269
They say I need to watch out for an email
after I submit this video.


139
0:9:3,269 --> 0:9:4,85
Hey, here it is.


140
0:9:4,85 --> 0:9:11,439
OK, a couple of things to fill out. If I weren`t
18, I`d need to have my parents to sign this.


141
0:9:11,439 --> 0:9:14,489
But I`m over 18, so I can sign it myself.


142
0:9:14,489 --> 0:9:18,569
Then send this back to the STUDENT NEWS team
and they`ll let me know when my I-Report is


143
0:9:18,569 --> 0:9:20,269
going to be on the show.


144
0:9:20,269 --> 0:9:24,959
AZUZ: And sometimes you might notice something`s
happening behind me in the newsroom here during


145
0:9:24,959 --> 0:9:30,22
our show. This meteorologist doesn`t have
to worry about what`s behind him, he`s got


146
0:9:30,22 --> 0:9:35,89
something happening below him -- check out
the bottom of his screen, it`s a cat walked


147
0:9:35,89 --> 0:9:39,189
right though the live broadcast, and then
hung around for a while. What`s awesome is


148
0:9:39,189 --> 0:9:44,1
that the reporter doesn`t even flinch. Thankfully,
the cat didn`t come near a microphone, because


149
0:9:44,1 --> 0:9:47,249
you know how we TV folks can get -- we can
be just so catty.


150
0:9:47,249 --> 0:9:51,16
That`s a tail for another day, so we hope
you enjoy the rest of yours. For CNN STUDENT


151
0:9:51,16 --> 0:11:51,16
NEWS, I`m Carl Azuz.
