0:10:55,875 --> 0:10:59,25
For 26 years, Kony has been
kidnapping children


198
0:10:59,25 --> 0:11:6,917
into his rebel group, the LRA...


199
0:11:6,917 --> 0:11:12,375
...turning the girls
into sex slaves...


200
0:11:12,375 --> 0:11:16,667
...and the boys into child soldiers.


201
0:11:16,667 --> 0:11:22,917
He makes them mutilate
people's faces.


202
0:11:22,917 --> 0:11:28,917
And he forces them
to kill their own parents.


203
0:11:28,917 --> 0:11:35,417
And this is not just a few children.


204
0:11:35,417 --> 0:11:41,333
It's been over 30,000 of them.


205
0:11:41,333 --> 0:11:50,83
And Jacob was one of those children.


206
0:11:50,83 --> 0:11:53,208
As if Kony's crimes
aren't bad enough,


207
0:11:53,208 --> 0:11:58,917
he is not fighting for any cause,
but only to maintain his power.


208
0:11:58,917 --> 0:12:1,75
He is not supported by anyone,


209
0:12:1,75 --> 0:12:3,583
and he has repeatedly
used peace talks


210
0:12:3,583 --> 0:12:7,333
to rearm and murder
again and again.


211
0:12:7,333 --> 0:12:10,0
Kony different times proposed peace,


212
0:12:10,0 --> 0:12:13,291
and then just regained strength
and attacked.


213
0:12:13,291 --> 0:12:15,0
This is the Head Prosecutor


214
0:12:15,0 --> 0:12:18,83
for the International Criminal Court.


215
0:12:18,83 --> 0:12:20,458
In 2002, when the court was started,


216
0:12:20,458 --> 0:12:23,333
their job was to find
and demand the arrest


217
0:12:23,333 --> 0:12:26,333
of the world's worst criminals.


218
0:12:26,333 --> 0:12:29,166
Although there are a lot
of warlords, murderers,


219
0:12:29,166 --> 0:12:31,166
and dictators in the world,


220
0:12:31,166 --> 0:12:36,75
the perversity of Kony's crimes
made him first on the Court's list.


221
0:12:36,75 --> 0:12:39,917
Kony is the first guy
indicted by the ICC.


222
0:12:39,917 --> 0:12:41,917
The crimes basically
are crimes against humanity


223
0:12:41,917 --> 0:12:44,333
and war crimes committed
against the civilian population


224
0:12:44,333 --> 0:12:49,667
including murder, sexual slavery,
rapes, abductions.


225
0:12:49,667 --> 0:12:52,75
We need to plan how to arrest Kony.


226
0:12:52,75 --> 0:12:53,959
Start to plan,


227
0:12:53,959 --> 0:12:55,208
and it has to be serious.


228
0:12:55,208 --> 0:12:57,917
In fact, the only way to stop Kony
is to show him,


229
0:12:57,917 --> 0:13:1,667
"Hey, we're going to arrest you."


230
0:13:1,667 --> 0:13:4,41
What do you think
we should do about him?


231
0:13:4,41 --> 0:13:7,25
We should stop him.


232
0:13:7,25 --> 0:13:8,5
The criminal here is Kony.


233
0:13:8,5 --> 0:13:11,166
Stop him and then solve
other problems.


234
0:13:11,166 --> 0:13:12,917
We should stop who?


235
0:13:12,917 --> 0:13:16,25
Him.


236
0:13:16,25 --> 0:13:19,125
JASON: It's obvious
that Kony should be stopped.


237
0:13:19,125 --> 0:13:23,834
The problem is, 99% of the planet
doesn't know who he is.


238
0:13:23,834 --> 0:13:28,917
If they knew, Kony would have
been stopped long ago.


239
0:13:28,917 --> 0:13:31,125
Let the world,
let the international community


240
0:13:31,125 --> 0:13:34,25
take justice to him there,
follow him wherever he is.


241
0:13:34,25 --> 0:13:38,75
First, to rescue our children,
and secondly, to deliver the justice.


242
0:13:38,75 --> 0:13:43,41
We are determined to cooperate
with any friend of Uganda


243
0:13:43,41 --> 0:13:48,5
to ensure that this mindless killing
and slaughter is ended.


244
0:13:48,5 --> 0:13:50,792
When my friends and I
came home from Uganda,


245
0:13:50,792 --> 0:13:52,667
we thought
that if the government knew,


246
0:13:52,667 --> 0:13:55,458
they would do something to stop him.


247
0:13:55,458 --> 0:13:57,417
But everyone in Washington
we talked to


248
0:13:57,417 --> 0:14:0,25
said there is no way
the United States


249
0:14:0,25 --> 0:14:4,417
will ever get involved in a conflict
where our national security


250
0:14:4,417 --> 0:14:7,375
or financial interests
aren't at stake.


251
0:14:7,375 --> 0:14:9,333
No administration --
Republican, Democrat,


252
0:14:9,333 --> 0:14:11,667
Obama, Bush, Clinton,
doesn't matter --


253
0:14:11,667 --> 0:14:13,208
would do enough


254
0:14:13,208 --> 0:14:15,834
because it's simply not
an important-enough issue


255
0:14:15,834 --> 0:14:19,417
on the radar screen
of American foreign policy.


256
0:14:19,417 --> 0:14:22,166
JASON: Since the government
said it was impossible,


257
0:14:22,166 --> 0:14:24,458
we didn't know what else to do


258
0:14:24,458 --> 0:14:25,917
but tell everyone we could


259
0:14:25,917 --> 0:14:29,375
about Jacob
and the invisible children.


260
0:14:29,375 --> 0:14:31,667
Let's show this movie
to as many people as possible


261
0:14:31,667 --> 0:14:33,708
in such a way
that we can't be ignored.


262
0:14:33,708 --> 0:14:36,917
And when we did,
people were shocked,


263
0:14:36,917 --> 0:14:40,417
and their awareness
turned into action.


264
0:14:40,417 --> 0:14:44,917
We started something --
a community.


265
0:14:44,917 --> 0:14:48,875
I have friends that have been living
in this conflict their entire life.


266
0:14:48,875 --> 0:14:51,25
Fight for that, because that is
what is gonna change this world,


267
0:14:51,25 --> 0:14:53,25
and that is what defines us.


268
0:14:53,25 --> 0:14:56,75
JASON: We got creative,
and we got loud.


269
0:14:56,75 --> 0:15:1,83
ALL: It's not over!
It's not over! It's not over!


270
0:15:1,83 --> 0:15:4,5
JASON: And as the LRA began
to move into other countries,


271
0:15:4,5 --> 0:15:7,667
Jacob and other Ugandans
came to the U.S.


272
0:15:7,667 --> 0:15:12,458
to speak on behalf of all people
suffering because of Kony.


273
0:15:12,458 --> 0:15:15,83
Even though Uganda
was relatively safe,


274
0:15:15,83 --> 0:15:18,875
they felt compelled to tell the world
that Kony was still out there


275
0:15:18,875 --> 0:15:21,458
and had to be stopped.


276
0:15:21,458 --> 0:15:24,75
I'm here so proud advocating
for the people who are back at home,


277
0:15:24,75 --> 0:15:27,959
and this change we are going to make
is going to last forever.


278
0:15:27,959 --> 0:15:30,291
We built a community
around the idea


279
0:15:30,291 --> 0:15:34,125
that where you live shouldn't
determine whether you live.


280
0:15:34,125 --> 0:15:38,583
We were committed to stop Kony
and rebuild what he had destroyed.


281
0:15:38,583 --> 0:15:40,917
And because we couldn't wait
for institutions


282
0:15:40,917 --> 0:15:42,959
or governments to step in,


283
0:15:42,959 --> 0:15:44,542
we did it ourselves


284
0:15:44,542 --> 0:15:48,708
with our time, talent, and money.


285
0:15:48,708 --> 0:15:51,208
So we rebuilt schools.


286
0:15:51,208 --> 0:15:56,333
The best you can offer a child
is by letting them be independent,


287
0:15:56,333 --> 0:15:57,917
and that was providing education.


288
0:15:57,917 --> 0:16:0,959
We created jobs.


289
0:16:0,959 --> 0:16:4,875
I have seen the lives of those
who have been hopeless,


290
0:16:4,875 --> 0:16:6,333
now they have hope.


291
0:16:6,333 --> 0:16:9,41
And we built
an early warning radio network


292
0:16:9,41 --> 0:16:11,25
on the front line of the war


293
0:16:11,25 --> 0:16:14,208
to protect villages
from rebel attacks.


294
0:16:14,208 --> 0:16:17,583
To update real time
what's happening on a war zone


295
0:16:17,583 --> 0:16:21,542
8,000 miles away.


296
0:16:21,542 --> 0:16:25,83
JASON: All of this was funded
by an army of young people


297
0:16:25,83 --> 0:16:26,917
who put their money
toward their belief


298
0:16:26,917 --> 0:16:29,5
in the value of all human life.


299
0:16:29,5 --> 0:16:33,708
They gave a few dollars a month
of what little they had


300
0:16:33,708 --> 0:16:35,917
to a program called TRI


301
0:16:35,917 --> 0:16:40,583
and proved that a bunch of littles
could make a big difference.


302
0:16:40,583 --> 0:16:45,375
And as a result,
the unseen became visible.


303
0:16:45,375 --> 0:16:49,125
We've seen these kids.


304
0:16:49,125 --> 0:16:52,834
We've heard their cries.


305
0:16:52,834 --> 0:16:56,792
This war must end.


306
0:16:56,792 --> 0:17:0,166
We will not stop.


307
0:17:0,166 --> 0:17:3,375
We will not fear.


308
0:17:3,375 --> 0:17:26,41
We will fight war.


309
0:17:26,41 --> 0:17:28,41
DELIVER YOUR VOICE


310
0:17:28,41 --> 0:17:30,917
I've talked to people from Mexico,
from Canada,


311
0:17:30,917 --> 0:17:31,917
from every other state
that I can think of.


312
0:17:31,917 --> 0:17:33,75
We're all doing this
for the exact same reason,


313
0:17:33,75 --> 0:17:36,5
and we're all coming
from completely different places.


314
0:17:36,5 --> 0:17:44,25
This is what the world
should be like.


315
0:17:44,25 --> 0:17:47,375
JASON: So, with hundreds
of thousands of people with us,


316
0:17:47,375 --> 0:17:49,625
we went back to Washington, D.C.,


317
0:17:49,625 --> 0:17:53,834
and we met with congressmen
and senators one by one


318
0:17:53,834 --> 0:17:56,75
on both sides --
Republicans, Democrats --


319
0:17:56,75 --> 0:17:58,834
and they all agreed with us.


320
0:17:58,834 --> 0:18:1,917
Joseph Kony's crimes
had to be stopped.


321
0:18:1,917 --> 0:18:3,625
With all the problems
that are out there,


322
0:18:3,625 --> 0:18:6,583
none is more severe than one that --
that mutilates


323
0:18:6,583 --> 0:18:9,208
and takes the lives of little kids.


324
0:18:9,208 --> 0:18:12,25
These young members of
the Invisible Children Organization


325
0:18:12,25 --> 0:18:17,208
know that no child should live in fear
of being abducted or killed.


326
0:18:17,208 --> 0:18:19,458
MCGOVERN: So they were
determined to become their voice.


327
0:18:19,458 --> 0:18:23,25
They realized that
these African children and families


328
0:18:23,25 --> 0:18:25,667
were invisible
to Washington policymakers.


329
0:18:25,667 --> 0:18:28,625
So they decided to make them visible.


330
0:18:28,625 --> 0:18:31,125
JASON: And what I was told
would never happen


331
0:18:31,125 --> 0:18:33,583
suddenly became possible.


332
0:18:33,583 --> 0:18:36,708
"In furtherance
of the Congress's stated policy,


333
0:18:36,708 --> 0:18:39,375
I have authorized
a small number of U.S. forces


334
0:18:39,375 --> 0:18:41,208
to deploy to Central Africa


335
0:18:41,208 --> 0:18:43,5
to provide assistance
to regional forces


336
0:18:43,5 --> 0:18:47,959
that are working toward the removal
of Joseph Kony from the battlefield.


337
0:18:47,959 --> 0:18:51,125
Sincerely, Barack Obama."


338
0:18:51,125 --> 0:18:54,166
[ Cheers and applause ]


339
0:18:54,166 --> 0:18:56,625
The surprise announcement came
in a letter from the White House.


340
0:18:56,625 --> 0:18:59,834
The U.S. President's decision
commits U.S. troops to help.


341
0:18:59,834 --> 0:19:1,25
Through advice and assistance --


342
0:19:1,25 --> 0:19:3,375
not putting Americans into combat --


343
0:19:3,375 --> 0:19:6,625
to help the countries of the region
end this threat once and for all.


344
0:19:6,625 --> 0:19:8,291
And that was
a worthwhile investment.


345
0:19:8,291 --> 0:19:12,458
[ Cheers and applause ]


346
0:19:12,458 --> 0:19:16,667
We used to think we could not do it,
and now when I see we can do it,


347
0:19:16,667 --> 0:19:18,0
I am overwhelmed.


348
0:19:18,0 --> 0:19:20,542
[ Ululating ]


349
0:19:20,542 --> 0:19:24,834
JASON: After eight years of work,
the government finally heard us.


350
0:19:24,834 --> 0:19:27,208
And in October of 2011,


351
0:19:27,208 --> 0:19:30,792
a hundred American advisers
were sent into Central Africa


352
0:19:30,792 --> 0:19:34,83
to assist the Ugandan army
in arresting Kony


353
0:19:34,83 --> 0:19:36,166
and stopping the LRA.


354
0:19:36,166 --> 0:19:38,0
It was the first time in history


355
0:19:38,0 --> 0:19:40,75
that the United States
took that kind of action


356
0:19:40,75 --> 0:19:44,667
because the people demanded it.


357
0:19:44,667 --> 0:19:55,25
Not for self-defense,
but because it was right.

HIGH FREQUENCY REPORT
FROM CENTRAL AFRICA


359
0:19:58,83 --> 0:20:0,917
DATE: 2 DECEMBER, 2011


360
0:20:0,917 --> 0:20:4,458
A 14-year-old boy who just escaped


361
0:20:4,458 --> 0:20:7,291
reports that
"Joseph Kony now knows


362
0:20:7,291 --> 0:20:10,708
of the United States' plan
to stop the LRA,


363
0:20:10,708 --> 0:20:14,625
and he is going to change his tactics
to avoid capture


364
0:20:14,625 --> 0:20:18,0
now that the great power
is after him."


365
0:20:18,0 --> 0:20:24,25
We've come so far.
But Kony is still out there.


366
0:20:24,25 --> 0:20:27,208
He's recently changed his tactics,


367
0:20:27,208 --> 0:20:30,834
making it even more difficult
to capture him.


368
0:20:30,834 --> 0:20:36,708
And international support
could be removed at any time.


369
0:20:36,708 --> 0:20:39,458
If we take the pressure off,
if we're not successful,


370
0:20:39,458 --> 0:20:43,41
he is going to be growing
his numbers.


371
0:20:43,41 --> 0:20:45,75
People forget,
and you've got to remind them,


372
0:20:45,75 --> 0:20:47,291
and it takes numbers to remind them.


373
0:20:47,291 --> 0:20:51,375
And if interest wanes,
then it'll just -- it'll go away,


374
0:20:51,375 --> 0:20:53,5
and I'd end up standing
out there alone


375
0:20:53,5 --> 0:20:57,667
trying to do something to support
completing the mission.


376
0:20:57,667 --> 0:20:59,75
It's got to be 2012.


377
0:20:59,75 --> 0:21:3,542
It's not bad for the youth,
it's bad for the world if we fail.

It's not important
just for Ugandan people,

0:21:5,375 --> 0:21:9,917
it's important for everyone.


380
0:21:9,917 --> 0:21:14,458
It's hard to look back
on some parts of human history.


381
0:21:14,458 --> 0:21:17,542
Because when we heard
about injustice,


382
0:21:17,542 --> 0:21:21,875
we cared,
but we didn't know what to do.


383
0:21:21,875 --> 0:21:25,834
Too often we did nothing.


384
0:21:25,834 --> 0:21:30,708
But if we're going to change that,
we have to start somewhere,


385
0:21:30,708 --> 0:21:34,917
so we're starting here,
with Joseph Kony


386
0:21:34,917 --> 0:21:37,917
because now we know what to do.


387
0:21:37,917 --> 0:21:40,708
Here it is. Ready?


388
0:21:40,708 --> 0:21:43,959
In order for Kony
to be arrested this year,


389
0:21:43,959 --> 0:21:47,375
the Ugandan military
has to find him.


390
0:21:47,375 --> 0:21:49,333
In order to find him,


391
0:21:49,333 --> 0:21:54,41
they need the technology and training
to track him in the vast jungle.


392
0:21:54,41 --> 0:21:57,0
That's where
the American advisers come in.


393
0:21:57,0 --> 0:22:0,125
But in order for the American
advisers to be there,


394
0:22:0,125 --> 0:22:2,75
the U.S. government
has to deploy them.


395
0:22:2,75 --> 0:22:5,834
They've done that,
but if the government doesn't believe


396
0:22:5,834 --> 0:22:8,125
that people care
about arresting Kony,


397
0:22:8,125 --> 0:22:10,667
the mission will be canceled.


398
0:22:10,667 --> 0:22:14,125
In order for the people to care,
they have to know.


399
0:22:14,125 --> 0:22:22,83
And they will only know
if Kony's name is everywhere.


400
0:22:22,83 --> 0:22:23,375
KONY CAPTURED


401
0:22:23,375 --> 0:22:24,959
This is the dream.


402
0:22:24,959 --> 0:22:28,625
Kony arrested
for all the world to see,


403
0:22:28,625 --> 0:22:33,458
and the abducted children
returned home.


404
0:22:33,458 --> 0:22:35,291
-JASON: Here's the biggest problem.
-Yeah.


405
0:22:35,291 --> 0:22:37,834
-Do you want to know what it is?
-Yeah.


406
0:22:37,834 --> 0:22:40,834
Nobody knows who he is.


407
0:22:40,834 --> 0:22:44,583
Nobody knows, but --
but I know who he is


408
0:22:44,583 --> 0:22:49,41
because I see him
on this picture right now.


409
0:22:49,41 --> 0:22:50,583
He's not famous.


410
0:22:50,583 --> 0:22:54,667
He's invisible.
Joseph Kony's invisible.


411
0:22:54,667 --> 0:22:57,708
JASON: Here is how we're going
to make him visible.


412
0:22:57,708 --> 0:22:59,83
MAKE HIM FAMOUS


413
0:22:59,83 --> 0:23:2,542
We are going to make Joseph Kony
a household name


414
0:23:2,542 --> 0:23:6,625
not to celebrate him,
but to bring his crimes to the light.


415
0:23:6,625 --> 0:23:10,25
And we are starting this year, 2012.


416
0:23:10,25 --> 0:23:12,375
We are targeting 20 culture makers


417
0:23:12,375 --> 0:23:14,333
and 12 policymakers


418
0:23:14,333 --> 0:23:16,75
to use their power for good.


419
0:23:16,75 --> 0:23:19,208
Let's start
with the 20 culture makers.


420
0:23:19,208 --> 0:23:23,333
Celebrities, athletes,
and billionaires have a loud voice,


421
0:23:23,333 --> 0:23:26,375
and what they talk about
spreads instantly.


422
0:23:26,375 --> 0:23:27,333
I want...


423
0:23:27,333 --> 0:23:30,25
I'd like indicted war criminals


424
0:23:30,25 --> 0:23:33,291
to enjoy the same level of celebrity
as me.


425
0:23:33,291 --> 0:23:34,75
That seems fair.


426
0:23:34,75 --> 0:23:37,708
That's our objective,
is to just shine a light on it.


427
0:23:37,708 --> 0:23:40,834
If our goal
is to get Kony's name known,


428
0:23:40,834 --> 0:23:42,792
the known should join us.


429
0:23:42,792 --> 0:23:45,83
We are targeting 20
of the most diverse


430
0:23:45,83 --> 0:23:46,667
and influential culture makers


431
0:23:46,667 --> 0:23:50,542
to speak out about Kony
and make him famous.


432
0:23:50,542 --> 0:23:52,41
-Oprah.
-Mark Zuckerberg.


433
0:23:52,41 --> 0:23:53,625
-Ryan Seacrest.
-WOMAN: Bono.


434
0:23:53,625 --> 0:23:55,917
JASON: Then we're going
after policymakers --


435
0:23:55,917 --> 0:23:59,583
the ones that have the authority
to see Kony captured.


436
0:23:59,583 --> 0:24:2,959
They decide
if the advisers stay or leave.


437
0:24:2,959 --> 0:24:5,625
So we need to remind them
that in this election year


438
0:24:5,625 --> 0:24:7,667
of fighting and name-calling,


439
0:24:7,667 --> 0:24:9,625
no matter what side you're on,


440
0:24:9,625 --> 0:24:12,375
this is something
we can all agree on.


441
0:24:12,375 --> 0:24:15,333
If a senator or congressman
notices 25 phone calls


442
0:24:15,333 --> 0:24:18,917
on any issue on any given day,
it is noted.


443
0:24:18,917 --> 0:24:22,125
When citizens
by the hundreds of thousands


444
0:24:22,125 --> 0:24:24,834
start demanding
that our government do something,


445
0:24:24,834 --> 0:24:27,25
suddenly it becomes
in the national interest


446
0:24:27,25 --> 0:24:30,75
of the United States government
to respond to this problem.


447
0:24:30,75 --> 0:24:33,41
JASON: We've identified
the 12 policymakers


448
0:24:33,41 --> 0:24:35,583
that could change the game
regarding Kony,


449
0:24:35,583 --> 0:24:37,375
so we're targeting them.


450
0:24:37,375 --> 0:24:40,625
On our website, we've made it easy
to write them directly,


451
0:24:40,625 --> 0:24:44,125
call them, meet with them,
and get their attention.


452
0:24:44,125 --> 0:24:46,834
If my son were kidnapped
and forced to kill,


453
0:24:46,834 --> 0:24:48,708
it would be all over the news.


454
0:24:48,708 --> 0:24:51,667
So we are making Kony
world news


455
0:24:51,667 --> 0:24:56,166
by redefining the propaganda
we see all day, every day


456
0:24:56,166 --> 0:24:59,0
that dictates who and what
we pay attention to.


457
0:24:59,0 --> 0:25:1,959
A lot of people feel powerless
to communicate their ideas.


458
0:25:1,959 --> 0:25:4,792
They think that, "Okay, you know,
I'm not a corporation.


459
0:25:4,792 --> 0:25:7,458
I don't own my own magazine
or news station.


460
0:25:7,458 --> 0:25:9,0
I just don't have any say."


461
0:25:9,0 --> 0:25:10,375
But seeing what I've done,


462
0:25:10,375 --> 0:25:12,5
I think it's empowered
a lot of people to realize


463
0:25:12,5 --> 0:25:14,5
that one individual
can make an impact.


464
0:25:14,5 --> 0:25:16,375
And I actually want
to demystify and say,


465
0:25:16,375 --> 0:25:20,667
"Here are these really simple tools.
Go out and rock it."


466
0:25:20,667 --> 0:25:22,792
JASON: And that's just
what we intend to do.


467
0:25:22,792 --> 0:25:27,166
♪ I can't stop ♪


468
0:25:27,166 --> 0:25:30,291
JASON: Our goal is to change
the conversation of our culture


469
0:25:30,291 --> 0:25:33,583
and get people to ask,
"Who is Joseph Kony?"


470
0:25:33,583 --> 0:25:36,542
We have printed hundreds
of thousands of posters,


471
0:25:36,542 --> 0:25:38,708
stickers, yard signs, and fliers


472
0:25:38,708 --> 0:25:40,917
that are right now, today,


473
0:25:40,917 --> 0:25:44,458
being put up in major cities
all over the world.


474
0:25:44,458 --> 0:25:47,0
We have thousands
of "Kony 2012" bracelets


475
0:25:47,0 --> 0:25:51,83
that we want everyone to wear
this year only.


476
0:25:51,83 --> 0:25:53,917
Each bracelet
has a unique I.D. number.


477
0:25:53,917 --> 0:25:58,333
Input that number and you enter
the mission to make Kony famous.


478
0:25:58,333 --> 0:26:2,959
You can geotag your posters
and track your impact in real time.


479
0:26:2,959 --> 0:26:6,5
Everything you need is in a box
called the Action Kit.


480
0:26:6,5 --> 0:26:10,83
It has two bracelets --
one for you and one to give away.


481
0:26:10,83 --> 0:26:12,959
And if you want to help fund
our lifesaving programs,


482
0:26:12,959 --> 0:26:16,41
donate a few dollars a month
through TRI


483
0:26:16,41 --> 0:26:18,792
and you can have the Action Kit
for free.


484
0:26:18,792 --> 0:26:20,917
Start making Kony famous today,


485
0:26:20,917 --> 0:26:24,583
but all of these efforts
will culminate on one day --


486
0:26:24,583 --> 0:26:27,959
April 20th --
when we cover the night.


487
0:26:27,959 --> 0:26:30,458
This is the day
when we will meet at sundown


488
0:26:30,458 --> 0:26:34,458
and blanket every street in every city
till the sun comes up.


489
0:26:34,458 --> 0:26:37,458
We will be smart,
and we will be thorough.


490
0:26:37,458 --> 0:26:40,0
The rest of the world
will go to bed Friday night


491
0:26:40,0 --> 0:26:42,875
and wake up to hundreds
of thousands of posters


492
0:26:42,875 --> 0:26:44,708
demanding justice on every corner.


493
0:26:44,708 --> 0:26:51,667

JASON: It's always been
that the decisions made by the few


497
0:27:8,5 --> 0:27:10,75
with the money and the power


498
0:27:10,75 --> 0:27:13,458
dictated the priorities
of their government


499
0:27:13,458 --> 0:27:15,542
and the stories in the media.


500
0:27:15,542 --> 0:27:20,667
They determine the lives and
the opportunities of their citizens.


501
0:27:20,667 --> 0:27:23,834
But now there is something
bigger than that.


502
0:27:23,834 --> 0:27:26,875
The people of the world
see each other


503
0:27:26,875 --> 0:27:29,542
and can protect each other.


504
0:27:29,542 --> 0:27:35,959
It's turning the system upside down,
and it changes everything.


505
0:27:35,959 --> 0:27:38,583
We are living in a new world,
Facebook World,


506
0:27:38,583 --> 0:27:42,667
in which 750 million people
share ideas,


507
0:27:42,667 --> 0:27:44,25
not thinking in borders.


508
0:27:44,25 --> 0:27:46,75
It's a global community,
bigger than the U.S.


509
0:27:46,75 --> 0:27:51,792
Joseph Kony was committing crimes
for twenty years, and no one cared.


510
0:27:51,792 --> 0:27:54,83
We care.


511
0:27:54,83 --> 0:27:57,5
We have reached
a crucial time in history


512
0:27:57,5 --> 0:28:1,208
where what we do
or don't do right now


513
0:28:1,208 --> 0:28:4,5
will affect every generation to come.


514
0:28:4,5 --> 0:28:7,333
Arresting Joseph Kony will prove


515
0:28:7,333 --> 0:28:9,875
that the world we live in
has new rules,


516
0:28:9,875 --> 0:28:13,291
that the technology
that has brought our planet together


517
0:28:13,291 --> 0:28:17,375
is allowing us to respond
to the problems of our friends.


518
0:28:17,375 --> 0:28:20,875
When it ends, finally,
by bringing Kony to justice,


519
0:28:20,875 --> 0:28:23,625
it should be celebrated worldwide.


520
0:28:23,625 --> 0:28:26,583
We are not just studying
human history.


521
0:28:26,583 --> 0:28:29,75
We are shaping it.


522
0:28:29,75 --> 0:28:31,75
At the end of my life,


523
0:28:31,75 --> 0:28:34,708
I want to say that the world
we've left behind


524
0:28:34,708 --> 0:28:37,25
is one that Gavin can be proud of,


525
0:28:37,25 --> 0:28:41,959
a place that doesn't allow
Joseph Konys and child soldiers,


526
0:28:41,959 --> 0:28:45,542
a place where children,
no matter where they live,


527
0:28:45,542 --> 0:28:48,75
have a childhood free from fear.


528
0:28:48,75 --> 0:28:51,792
-I'm gonna be like you, Dad.
-JASON: When you grow up?


529
0:28:51,792 --> 0:28:53,333
-Yeah.
-Are you sure?


530
0:28:53,333 --> 0:28:57,834
I'm gonna come with you to Africa.


531
0:28:57,834 --> 0:29:1,41
JASON: The better world we want
is coming.


532
0:29:1,41 --> 0:29:11,166
It's just waiting for us
to stop at nothing.
