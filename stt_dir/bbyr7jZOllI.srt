>> For our presentation today from Kirk Sorensen,
the founder of Flibe Energy. Kirk has been


2
0:0:4,299 --> 0:0:8,549
a promoter of energy from Thorium for a long
time as [INDISTINCT] energyfromthorium.com


3
0:0:8,549 --> 0:0:14,919
where pretty big community of amateurs and
experts from around the world that had been


4
0:0:14,919 --> 0:0:19,84
contributing to the community effort to define
what would be the optimal Thorium reactor,


5
0:0:19,84 --> 0:0:24,46
nuclear reactor which generates electricity
from Thorium. This is a technology that's


6
0:0:24,46 --> 0:0:32,11
been around for a long time since, shortly
after World War Two. It was matured well up


7
0:0:32,11 --> 0:0:35,42
until early 1970s and then, and then kind
of suddenly ended in favor of the liquid-metal


8
0:0:35,42 --> 0:0:41,75
fast breeder reactor which then also ended.
And Kirk will give us a talk today and explain


9
0:0:41,75 --> 0:0:46,57
kind of what went wrong, why it stopped, why
it--how is this been done. You know, if it's


10
0:0:46,57 --> 0:0:50,35
such a great idea, why aren’t we doing it?
And their actions have very good reasons for


11
0:0:50,35 --> 0:0:54,98
that and maybe other reasons are cost and
then, maybe we should start doing it again.


12
0:0:54,98 --> 0:0:57,78
So, please have Kirk Sorensen.
>> SORENSEN: Thank you very much, Chris. I'm


13
0:0:57,78 --> 0:1:1,859
very glad to be here at Google today and given
another Tech-talk. I always enjoy coming and


14
0:1:1,859 --> 0:1:6,68
been a part of these things. The question
that I'm going to try to answer today is one


15
0:1:6,68 --> 0:1:10,84
that I'm often asked as I give presentations
on Thorium. In fact, I'm almost always asked


16
0:1:10,84 --> 0:1:16,1
this question which is, "Kirk, Thorium sounds
like a great idea. It sounds like it's a good


17
0:1:16,1 --> 0:1:20,87
technology, why didn’t this happen?" We
are Flibe Energy a new company to develop


18
0:1:20,87 --> 0:1:26,8
liquid fluoride Thorium reactor technology.
We're following the vision of Alvin Weinberg.


19
0:1:26,8 --> 0:1:31,32
He was the director of Oak Ridge National
Lab from the 50s to the 1970s and he had a


20
0:1:31,32 --> 0:1:37,1
vision of how we could use Thorium to advance
beyond the current constrains of our society


21
0:1:37,1 --> 0:1:43,14
in terms of fossil fuels, hydro power and
existing nuclear technology. One of the amazing


22
0:1:43,14 --> 0:1:47,49
parts about his vision was how this could
transform not only the US economy but many


23
0:1:47,49 --> 0:1:52,25
other places in the world. Some of which don’t
have the resources that we have in terms of


24
0:1:52,25 --> 0:1:57,44
fresh water or arable land. This is a vision
he had of how Thorium reactors could be used


25
0:1:57,44 --> 0:2:3,28
to desalinate water, grow crops in desert
areas and to some of us like caught terraforming


26
0:2:3,28 --> 0:2:9,5
the earth, but to really truly change the
economic balance of the world. Weinberg's


27
0:2:9,5 --> 0:2:13,8
vision on the other hand, was brought to an
end in the early 1970s and that is really


28
0:2:13,8 --> 0:2:18,13
the subject of the talk today. There really
were three options for nuclear energy at the


29
0:2:18,13 --> 0:2:23,95
dawn of the nuclear era. There was Uranium-235
which was fissile form of Uranium. This was


30
0:2:23,95 --> 0:2:28,8
the form of Uranium, they could actually be
utilized directly in a nuclear reactor. Most


31
0:2:28,8 --> 0:2:34,61
of the Uranium was the Uranium-238. This had
to be transformed into another nuclear fuel


32
0:2:34,61 --> 0:2:38,75
called Plutonium before it could be used.
And then there was Thorium and in a similar


33
0:2:38,75 --> 0:2:45,32
magnitude reining 238, it also had to be transformed
into another nuclear fuel, Uranium-233 before


34
0:2:45,32 --> 0:2:49,88
it could use in a reactor. There were some
significant differences though between these


35
0:2:49,88 --> 0:2:55,2
three fuels. As I mentioned, Uranium-235 could
be used directly. The other two had to be


36
0:2:55,2 --> 0:2:59,48
transformed and that meant, they needed two
neutrons to be consumed, one to transform


37
0:2:59,48 --> 0:3:3,96
them and one to fission them. And in order
for this to be a sustainable process, you


38
0:3:3,96 --> 0:3:8,36
have to know what will they emit more than
two neutrons when they fission. And the answer


39
0:3:8,36 --> 0:3:13,43
was, "Yes, they did." In fact, all three of
them emitted more than two neutrons when they


40
0:3:13,43 --> 0:3:18,33
fission. Here was Uranium-235, Uranium-233
admitted about two and a half neutrons per


41
0:3:18,33 --> 0:3:23,74
fission and Plutonium with fission with almost
three neutrons per fission. So, it would emit


42
0:3:23,74 --> 0:3:28,59
the most neutrons when it fissions. So, the
first answer was yes. All three of the fuels


43
0:3:28,59 --> 0:3:33,33
gave off enough neutrons to sustain their
consumption of reactor. But there was more


44
0:3:33,33 --> 0:3:39,15
to the story, this is a busy graph and I apologize
in advance for it. But it tells the story


45
0:3:39,15 --> 0:3:43,9
of much of our nuclear history. And what it
shows is, Plutonium doesn’t emit enough


46
0:3:43,9 --> 0:3:49,83
neutrons when it isn’t being fission by
fast neutrons in order to continue the conversion


47
0:3:49,83 --> 0:3:56,349
of future Uranium into Plutonium to continue
its breeding. It has to be fissioned by fast


48
0:3:56,349 --> 0:4:2,12
neutrons in order to do this. On the other
hand, Thorium and Uranium-233 produce enough


49
0:4:2,12 --> 0:4:7,13
neutrons in both thermal and fast fission
to continue the utilization of that fuel.


50
0:4:7,13 --> 0:4:12,61
I call it the Threshold of Two, and it's not
just about how many neutrons they emit, but


51
0:4:12,61 --> 0:4:17,22
how many neutrons they emit even accounting
for absorption. Because they don’t always


52
0:4:17,22 --> 0:4:23,169
fission every single time they're hit by a
neutron. Uranium-233 and Plutonium-239 of


53
0:4:23,169 --> 0:4:30,75
those two in thermal neutrons, only Uranium-233
crosses the Threshold of Two. In fast fission


54
0:4:30,75 --> 0:4:38,9
on the other hand, both Uranium-233 and Plutonium-239
crossed the Threshold of Two. So, it would


55
0:4:38,9 --> 0:4:42,46
seem, what we just want a fast reactor. We
don’t want a reactor that uses slow down


56
0:4:42,46 --> 0:4:47,77
thermal neutrons, we want a fast reactor because--then
we will great confidence that we will be able


57
0:4:47,77 --> 0:4:53,77
to sustain the consumption of nuclear fuel.
Well, there's a powerful disincentive to doing


58
0:4:53,77 --> 0:4:59,47
it this way and it has to do with what are
called, Cross-Sections. These are mathematical


59
0:4:59,47 --> 0:5:5,21
way of describing how likely it is that a
nuclear reaction will proceed and they the


60
0:5:5,21 --> 0:5:11,22
form of areas, quite literally in area someone's
called "a barn" which is, 10 to the minus


61
0:5:11,22 --> 0:5:16,72
24 square centimeters. This is a really, really,
really small unit to variat. But this is the


62
0:5:16,72 --> 0:5:22,55
unit that nuclear engineers used to describe
how probable a nuclear reaction is. This is


63
0:5:22,55 --> 0:5:29,7
the cross-section of Uranium-233 to a thermal
neutron. By comparison, this very, very small


64
0:5:29,7 --> 0:5:33,86
circle right here is the cross-section of
Uranium 233 to a fast neutron. So, it's not


65
0:5:33,86 --> 0:5:40,74
hard to see which one is more likely to have
a fission reaction. A thermal neutron is far


66
0:5:40,74 --> 0:5:45,35
more likely to cause the fission reaction
than a fast neutron. So, the advantage now


67
0:5:45,35 --> 0:5:50,79
seems to be for the thermal reactors. This
is a general feature of almost all nuclear


68
0:5:50,79 --> 0:5:55,76
materials that their cross-sections are much
larger to thermal neutrons than they are to


69
0:5:55,76 --> 0:6:1,729
fast neutrons. Here we see the cross-section
of Plutonium. It's huge in the thermal spectrum


70
0:6:1,729 --> 0:6:7,57
and it's very, very small in the fast spectrum.
And that means that Plutonium is much more


71
0:6:7,57 --> 0:6:13,52
likely to have a nuclear reaction to a slow
down neutron than to a fast neutron. So again,


72
0:6:13,52 --> 0:6:21,2
why consider a fast reactor? Well, it's because--look
at these red regions. Those regions indicate


73
0:6:21,2 --> 0:6:25,36
the probability that the neutron will be absorbed
but not cause a fission, that it will simply


74
0:6:25,36 --> 0:6:31,99
just be absorbed. You can see that, that probability
is about 10% for Uranium-233 in the thermal.


75
0:6:31,99 --> 0:6:38,5
But if we were to magnify that cross-section,
significantly by factor of 500, you could


76
0:6:38,5 --> 0:6:44,93
see that, that probability becomes much smaller
in the fast spectrum. A fast neutron if it


77
0:6:44,93 --> 0:6:50,15
is absorbed almost always will cause a fission.
This is significant for Uranium-233 but it's


78
0:6:50,15 --> 0:6:55,86
much more significant for Plutonium 239. It
will absorb a neutron about one-third of the


79
0:6:55,86 --> 0:7:1,68
time and not cause a fission. But in the fast
spectrum, it will almost always cause a fission.


80
0:7:1,68 --> 0:7:8,62
So, to make sure that we cross that Threshold
of Two, it was necessary to build fast reactors


81
0:7:8,62 --> 0:7:14,229
that would use Plutonium. On the other hand,
it was conceivable that you could build thermal


82
0:7:14,229 --> 0:7:21,4
or fast reactors that would use Uranium-233.
This uncertainty was not particularly appearing


83
0:7:21,4 --> 0:7:25,1
at the time. They wanted to move out in directions
that they felt very confident it. So, the


84
0:7:25,1 --> 0:7:31,889
United States began to pursue a fast breeder
reactor. In 1951, they build the experimental


85
0:7:31,889 --> 0:7:36,8
breeder reactor one in Idaho. This was a fast
breeder reactor. This was a reactor that was


86
0:7:36,8 --> 0:7:42,33
going to not slow down neutrons but use fast
neutrons to convert Uranium into Plutonium


87
0:7:42,33 --> 0:7:46,57
and to breed from it. This was actually the
first reactor to generate some power. It lit


88
0:7:46,57 --> 0:7:50,919
four little light bulbs and ultimately generated,
I believe several hundred kilowatts of power.


89
0:7:50,919 --> 0:7:56,389
But it shows how early the United States was
moving out on the fast breeder reactor. It


90
0:7:56,389 --> 0:8:2,5
was followed by the experimental breed reactor
number two, which was also a fast breeder


91
0:8:2,5 --> 0:8:8,35
reactor much larger this time. It made 62
megawatts of thermal power. Industry got excited


92
0:8:8,35 --> 0:8:14,63
about the potential for making breeder reactors.
This was actually a commercial reactor, The


93
0:8:14,63 --> 0:8:21,46
Enrico Fermi Breeder Reactor in Monroe Michigan.
They began working on this reactor in 1957


94
0:8:21,46 --> 0:8:28,66
and it achieved criticality in 1966. But shortly
after it achieved criticality, they had a


95
0:8:28,66 --> 0:8:33,929
melt down at the Enrico Fermi Reactor where
the reactor was damaged and shut down. At


96
0:8:33,929 --> 0:8:39,29
this time, Alvin Weinberg and his colleagues
at the Oak Ridge National Labs were working


97
0:8:39,29 --> 0:8:44,49
on Molten-salt Reactors. These were reactors
that didn’t operate in the fast spectrum.


98
0:8:44,49 --> 0:8:49,449
They operate to slow down neutrons and they
predominantly were interested in using Thorium


99
0:8:49,449 --> 0:8:55,23
and Uranium-233. Weinberg wrote an introduction
to a series of papers that were published


100
0:8:55,23 --> 0:9:1,149
in a nuclear journal in 1969. And these are
some of the words that he used and I've always


101
0:9:1,149 --> 0:9:7,259
found it very interesting how careful and
measured he was with his utilization of language.


102
0:9:7,259 --> 0:9:11,839
Because he knew that most of the effort of
the country was on the fast breeder reactor


103
0:9:11,839 --> 0:9:17,189
and very little in comparison was on the Molten-Salt
Reactor. And he said, "The prevailing view


104
0:9:17,189 --> 0:9:23,209
holds that the liquid-metal fast breeder reactor
is the proper path to ubiquitous permanent


105
0:9:23,209 --> 0:9:28,129
energy. It is no secret that I, as well many
of my colleagues at Oak Ridge, have always


106
0:9:28,129 --> 0:9:34,269
felt differently. When the idea of the breeder
was first suggested in 1943, the rapid and


107
0:9:34,269 --> 0:9:39,92
the efficient recycle of the partially spec
core was regarded as the main problem. Nothing


108
0:9:39,92 --> 0:9:44,819
that has happened in the ensuing quarter century
has fundamentally changed this." So, Weinberg


109
0:9:44,819 --> 0:9:51,499
begins to lay out the scenario that physics
hasn't changed and unless you can rapidly


110
0:9:51,499 --> 0:9:56,769
reprocess nuclear fuel, you won't be able
to realize the benefits of the breeder reactor.


111
0:9:56,769 --> 0:10:1,73
He then goes on to offer an alternative to
the prevailing view. The successful breeder


112
0:10:1,73 --> 0:10:7,269
will be the one that can deal with the spent
fuel or the spent core most rationally either


113
0:10:7,269 --> 0:10:13,29
by achieving extremely long burn up or by
greatly simplifying the entire recycle step.


114
0:10:13,29 --> 0:10:17,6
We at Oak Ridge, have always been intrigued
by this latter possibility. It explains our


115
0:10:17,6 --> 0:10:22,989
long commitment to liquid fuel reactors, first,
the Aqueous homogenous and now the Molten-salt.


116
0:10:22,989 --> 0:10:28,41
So, he presented a different scenario, how
they could use fluid field reactors to achieve


117
0:10:28,41 --> 0:10:34,269
the overall goal of the efficient utilization
of nuclear fuel. And the series of papers


118
0:10:34,269 --> 0:10:39,189
that followed in this were some of the first
discussions in the nuclear literature about


119
0:10:39,189 --> 0:10:43,189
the potential of the Molten-salt reactor.
It was not well-known. The moneys that had


120
0:10:43,189 --> 0:10:48,319
been appropriated in order to research the
different breeder reactor types are listed


121
0:10:48,319 --> 0:10:51,97
in this graph and I found this graph, thanks
to a book that had been scanned into Google


122
0:10:51,97 --> 0:10:56,389
books. Thanks. So, project started by my good
friend, Chris Eucare here, so I greatly appreciate--this


123
0:10:56,389 --> 0:11:0,29
is one of the many things I'm sure people
have done with your work. Numbers are one


124
0:11:0,29 --> 0:11:5,209
thing, so I took it and threw it in a spreadsheet
and made a nice graph. The red line shows


125
0:11:5,209 --> 0:11:9,73
the expenditures on the fast breeder reactor,
and this graph only begin to 1968. At that


126
0:11:9,73 --> 0:11:15,949
point, the United States had already built
several fast breeder reactors. We're looking


127
0:11:15,949 --> 0:11:22,59
at 75 to nearly a hundred million dollars
in 1968. It's very hard to see the green line


128
0:11:22,59 --> 0:11:26,959
for the Molten-salt breeder reactor technology,
it's extremely low and then ultimately, it


129
0:11:26,959 --> 0:11:32,119
was cancelled and briefly resurrected in 1975
and then cancelled again. So, on a scale of


130
0:11:32,119 --> 0:11:36,899
the appropriations that were made to the fast
breeder reactor, you've just about can't see


131
0:11:36,899 --> 0:11:43,559
the appropriations that were made to the Molten-salt
breeder reactor. In June of 1971, President


132
0:11:43,559 --> 0:11:50,769
Richard Nixon made a speech where he talked
about the need for the fast breeder reactor.


133
0:11:50,769 --> 0:11:55,739
He put the United States on record that this
would be a top national goal. Now, we don't


134
0:11:55,739 --> 0:12:0,769
have any video from the speech he gave that
day. But later on in that day, he called Representative


135
0:12:0,769 --> 0:12:5,67
Craig Hosmer from California to tell him about
the speech about the breeder reactor.


136
0:12:5,67 --> 0:12:8,47
>> Yeah.
>> Calling for Craig Hosmer, sir. Ready?


137
0:12:8,47 --> 0:12:10,6
>> HOSMER: Oh.
>> NIXON: Okay.


138
0:12:10,6 --> 0:12:13,999
>> HOSMER: Mister President?
>> NIXON: Since you missed our meeting when


139
0:12:13,999 --> 0:12:16,329
we had--on a breeder reactor, you know...
>> HOSMER: Okay.


140
0:12:16,329 --> 0:12:19,429
>> NIXON: ...I wanted you to know that we
sent a message today, Craig but then I just


141
0:12:19,429 --> 0:12:23,399
told Zigler that--I told Zigler to tell the
press that there's a by part [INDISTINCT]


142
0:12:23,399 --> 0:12:26,29
that you and [INDISTINCT]
>> HOSMER: All right.


143
0:12:26,29 --> 0:12:29,98
>> NIXON: ...had been bugged me about it.
The one thing I wanted to tell you too is


144
0:12:29,98 --> 0:12:34,519
that, I--Holified was there last night at
the [INDISTINCT] Club thing, and I--and I


145
0:12:34,519 --> 0:12:38,899
have told the people around here--now, this
is got to be something we play very close


146
0:12:38,899 --> 0:12:43,949
to the vest, but I'm being ruthless on one
thing, any activities that we possibly can,


147
0:12:43,949 --> 0:12:49,249
should be placed in southern California in
this field. And also, in the saline water


148
0:12:49,249 --> 0:12:50,1
field.
>> HOSMER: Correct.


149
0:12:50,1 --> 0:12:54,589
>> NIXON: You know, we need the jobs. We need
to sum up those air passed workers. Now, we


150
0:12:54,589 --> 0:12:58,619
got some--we're going to do a couple of new
things on water for example, and I have decided


151
0:12:58,619 --> 0:13:3,449
to throw one big plant in southern California.
I mean, you know, a big one of these implementing


152
0:13:3,449 --> 0:13:5,869
it, if you know what I mean, is...
>> HOSMER: Right, right.


153
0:13:5,869 --> 0:13:10,17
>> NIXON: ...it's just a question how big
the plant is. But in this energy field, I


154
0:13:10,17 --> 0:13:15,649
told Dr. David and of course, Seaborg and
the rest that we do it. So, on the committee,


155
0:13:15,649 --> 0:13:18,369
everytime you have a chance, needle them,
say, "Where is this going to be?" Let's push


156
0:13:18,369 --> 0:13:19,69
the California thing. Can you do that?
>> HOSMER: Incidentally, Mister President...


157
0:13:19,69 --> 0:13:19,549
>> NIXON: Yeah.
>> HOSMER: ...I am so delighted that you released


158
0:13:19,549 --> 0:13:21,579
$16 million on the improvement if the enriching
complex. I bet that handles the bad...


159
0:13:21,579 --> 0:13:24,519
>> NIXON: Right.
>> HOSMER: ...political problem for us.


160
0:13:24,519 --> 0:13:31,85
>> NIXON: Right. Good, good. Well, they told
me you were interested in it, and I said,


161
0:13:31,85 --> 0:13:39,619
"Well, if Hosmer is for it, I'm for it."
>> SORENSEN: All right. Let's pause there.


162
0:13:39,619 --> 0:13:45,359
You can tell just a little bit from listening
to Nixon's words that, the fast breeder reactor


163
0:13:45,359 --> 0:13:49,989
was viewed by him and probably some others
in administration as something that they could


164
0:13:49,989 --> 0:13:54,859
use to economic advantage for the people of
southern California to get it. Nixon was from


165
0:13:54,859 --> 0:13:59,359
California, Hosman was from southern California,
Holifield, Chet Holified who ran the--joined


166
0:13:59,359 --> 0:14:4,509
the committee on atomic energy was also from
California. And I think some of the phrases


167
0:14:4,509 --> 0:14:8,489
in this--in this phone call is very interesting.
I'm going to be ruthless on this. We've got


168
0:14:8,489 --> 0:14:12,739
to play this very close to the vest. It's
about jobs, if you're for it, and I'm for


169
0:14:12,739 --> 0:14:19,189
it. It doesn't lead me to believe that the
President was seriously considering alternatives


170
0:14:19,189 --> 0:14:22,589
to the fast breeder reactor. Another past
that could’ve been taken. It was focused


171
0:14:22,589 --> 0:14:27,879
on what can we do right now to get jobs back
home to the--the folks are going to support


172
0:14:27,879 --> 0:14:33,41
us in re-election. Well a few months later,
Nixon was at Hanford, Washington which is


173
0:14:33,41 --> 0:14:39,69
the side of many of our nations earliest nuclear
energy facilities. And he was also giving


174
0:14:39,69 --> 0:14:46,49
a talk on the significance of the breeder
reactor. And again, note the economic potential


175
0:14:46,49 --> 0:14:48,23
that he puts in front of people during his
talk.


176
0:14:48,23 --> 0:14:52,819
>> NIXON: That is why I made an announcement
on June the 4th, one that didn't get of course


177
0:14:52,819 --> 0:14:57,689
the enormous publicity of the announcement
of the journey to China, one that didn't get


178
0:14:57,689 --> 0:15:2,619
the publicity of my announcement of the economic
policy to deal with the problems of inflation


179
0:15:2,619 --> 0:15:7,759
and unemployment in this country. But one
which in terms of the future of the country


180
0:15:7,759 --> 0:15:15,439
maybe in long term, long range terms even
more important in some respects and that is,


181
0:15:15,439 --> 0:15:21,769
at the United States was going to go forward
in building a breeder reactor. Now, don't


182
0:15:21,769 --> 0:15:25,959
ask me what a breeder reactor is, ask Dr.
Slazenger, but don't tell, I'm not to tell


183
0:15:25,959 --> 0:15:30,259
you because unless you're one of those PHDs,
you won't understand it either. But what I


184
0:15:30,259 --> 0:15:39,49
do know is this, that here we have the potentiality
of holding a new breakthrough and the development


185
0:15:39,49 --> 0:15:45,97
of power for peace, and that means jobs, jobs
for this area but jobs and power for hundreds


186
0:15:45,97 --> 0:15:52,149
from millions of people all over the world.
>> SORENSEN: Jobs, job is what it was all


187
0:15:52,149 --> 0:15:56,249
about. And this area that Nixon was talking
to in Hanford, Washington, this was a very


188
0:15:56,249 --> 0:16:1,449
well-educated area. A lot of the people in
the back in there probably had PHDs in nuclear


189
0:16:1,449 --> 0:16:5,449
engineering and knew exactly what a breeder
reactor was. But Nixon was emphasizing the


190
0:16:5,449 --> 0:16:11,25
economic benefits to them of his announcement
that there was going to be a breeder reactor.


191
0:16:11,25 --> 0:16:15,449
>> NIXON: All of this business about breeder
reactors and nuclear energy and the stuff


192
0:16:15,449 --> 0:16:20,29
is over my--that was one of my poorest subjects,
Science and I got through it, but I had to


193
0:16:20,29 --> 0:16:23,159
work too hard. I gave it up when I was about
a sophomore.


194
0:16:23,159 --> 0:16:27,209
>> SORENSEN: Well, maybe it might have benefited
our country a little more if Nixon had been


195
0:16:27,209 --> 0:16:31,649
able to ascertain the different values of
different types of a breeder reactors and


196
0:16:31,649 --> 0:16:37,579
why one might have an advantage over another.
But nevertheless, the US was now firmly on


197
0:16:37,579 --> 0:16:42,799
the course of making the breeder reactor,
a national priority. Nixon emphasized it in


198
0:16:42,799 --> 0:16:47,889
his State of the Union Speech. He then emphasized
it in another message to congress, the democratic


199
0:16:47,889 --> 0:16:53,91
and republic in party platforms in 1972 both
included the fast breeder reactor as a national


200
0:16:53,91 --> 0:16:59,29
priority. Now, this is about the time when
Weinberg's story with the Molten-salt reactor


201
0:16:59,29 --> 0:17:4,67
begins to intersect this much larger story
of the breeder reactor and the congressional


202
0:17:4,67 --> 0:17:10,44
support behind it as well as the presidential
support. Testimony given in September of 1972,


203
0:17:10,44 --> 0:17:15,32
they noted that the US government would be
expected to cover cost overruns on the breeder


204
0:17:15,32 --> 0:17:21,38
reactor and the development cost would go
over $700,000,000. At this point, industry


205
0:17:21,38 --> 0:17:26,81
had already committed $200,000,000 then your
dollars to the breeder reactor effort. Representative


206
0:17:26,81 --> 0:17:31,99
Craig Hosmer, who was the fellow on the phone
call that we heard earlier, said that "If


207
0:17:31,99 --> 0:17:35,91
cost targets were missed, I for one don't
intend to scream and holler about it." It's


208
0:17:35,91 --> 0:17:41,24
not hard to see that they could see great
economic benefits occurring to their area


209
0:17:41,24 --> 0:17:47,3
of the country if the breeder reactor program
was to go forward. In that same month, the


210
0:17:47,3 --> 0:17:53,36
atomic energy commission issued WASH 1222,
which was an evaluation of Weinberg's Molten-salt


211
0:17:53,36 --> 0:17:58,91
breeder reactor. It was highly critical of
several technological issues that had been


212
0:17:58,91 --> 0:18:4,94
encountered during the development of that
idea, more importantly though, it almost completely


213
0:18:4,94 --> 0:18:11,33
ignored the safety and economic improvements
possible through the use of the Molten-salt


214
0:18:11,33 --> 0:18:16,78
breeder reactor technology. Weinberg himself
had a meeting which Chet Holified and Milton


215
0:18:16,78 --> 0:18:21,95
Shaw of the Atomic energy commission in 1972.
We don't know exactly when this meeting took


216
0:18:21,95 --> 0:18:26,45
place. Our only record of it is contained
in Weinberg's book, his autobiography, The


217
0:18:26,45 --> 0:18:31,62
First Nuclear. Here's what he said, "I found
myself increasingly at odd with the reactor


218
0:18:31,62 --> 0:18:35,73
to the vision of the Atomic energy commission.
The director at the time was Milton Shaw.


219
0:18:35,73 --> 0:18:40,17
Milt was cut from the Rickover cloth, he had
a singleness of purpose and was prepared to


220
0:18:40,17 --> 0:18:44,53
bend the rules and regulations in achievement
of his goal." Why would he feel this pressure


221
0:18:44,53 --> 0:18:49,2
if he has the president and these congressional
folks pushing for the fast breeder reactor?


222
0:18:49,2 --> 0:18:53,2
"At the time, he became director, the atomic
energy commission had made the liquid-metal


223
0:18:53,2 --> 0:18:58,82
fast breeder reactor, the primary goal of
it's reactor program. Milt tackled the LMFBR


224
0:18:58,82 --> 0:19:3,89
project with Rickoverian dedication: woe unto
any who stood in his way. This caused problems


225
0:19:3,89 --> 0:19:8,79
for me since I was still espousing the Molten-salt
breeder." Milt was like a bull, he enjoyed


226
0:19:8,79 --> 0:19:13,39
congressional confidence so his position in
the AEC was unassailable. And it was clear


227
0:19:13,39 --> 0:19:17,72
that he had little confidence in me or Oak
Ridge. After all, we were pushing Molten-salt


228
0:19:17,72 --> 0:19:22,58
not the fast breeder, more than that, we were
being troublesome over the question of reactor


229
0:19:22,58 --> 0:19:28,57
safety. And that was another aspect that was
getting Weinberg into trouble. He had invented


230
0:19:28,57 --> 0:19:32,97
the pressurized light water reactor that formed
the backbone of the reactor technologies that


231
0:19:32,97 --> 0:19:36,96
were being developed in the country at that
time. Here's a picture of some of the pressurized


232
0:19:36,96 --> 0:19:42,71
water reactors. His work on the Thorium reactor
led him to believe that a significantly higher


233
0:19:42,71 --> 0:19:46,93
level of safety was possible. And this--in
large part was because the Thorium reactor


234
0:19:46,93 --> 0:19:53,2
operated low pressures whereas, water-cooled
reactors operated the high pressures. So,


235
0:19:53,2 --> 0:19:58,64
he was beginning to bring these issues up
in support of the Thorium reactor, but it


236
0:19:58,64 --> 0:20:3,34
didn't have that effect. Congressman Chet
Hollifield was clearly exasperated with me


237
0:20:3,34 --> 0:20:7,7
and he finally blurted out, "Alvin, if you're
so concerned about the safety reactors, then


238
0:20:7,7 --> 0:20:12,64
I think it might be time for you to leave
nuclear energy." But I was speechless, but


239
0:20:12,64 --> 0:20:17,17
it was apparent to me that my style, my attitude
and my perception of future were no longer


240
0:20:17,17 --> 0:20:22,65
in tune with the powers within the AEC. And
I think this was a very sad moment in the


241
0:20:22,65 --> 0:20:27,44
history of our country and probably in the
history of the world because an entire direction


242
0:20:27,44 --> 0:20:35,49
of potential development was being ended at
that moment by a not well thought out comment


243
0:20:35,49 --> 0:20:39,74
by Congressman Holifield, who was very powerful.
Weinberg looked at this fairly philosophically


244
0:20:39,74 --> 0:20:44,7
when he wrote his autobiography in 1994. And
He said, "I look back in these events, I realize


245
0:20:44,7 --> 0:20:48,17
that leaving Oak Ridge was the best thing
that could have happened to me. My views about


246
0:20:48,17 --> 0:20:52,66
nuclear energy were at variance with those
of the AEC congressional leadership. After


247
0:20:52,66 --> 0:20:56,73
all, it was I who had called nuclear energy
a Faustian bargain, who continued to promote


248
0:20:56,73 --> 0:21:2,48
the molten-salt breeder. So, Weinberg's pursuit
of Thorium appears to have had a great deal


249
0:21:2,48 --> 0:21:8,46
to do with why he was fired from his position
at Oak Ridge in the atomic energy commission.


250
0:21:8,46 --> 0:21:13,72
And it's not hard to see when you stack up
the forces that weren't supportive of the


251
0:21:13,72 --> 0:21:20,15
fast breeder and that effort, the money, the
industrial backing, the confidence they had


252
0:21:20,15 --> 0:21:25,72
and here is Weinberg trying to push something
different, why they would attempt to truncate


253
0:21:25,72 --> 0:21:30,8
his work. The [INDISTINCT] that was in January
of 1973, Oak Ridge was directed by the atomic


254
0:21:30,8 --> 0:21:35,2
energy commission to terminate the development
of the molten-salt reactor. April of that


255
0:21:35,2 --> 0:21:39,38
year, Nixon went into reiterate his commitment
to the fast breeder, saying it would extract


256
0:21:39,38 --> 0:21:43,65
30 times more energy from Uranium than light
water reactors and it was highest priority


257
0:21:43,65 --> 0:21:47,94
target for nuclear resear and development.
We weren't the only ones pursuing the fast


258
0:21:47,94 --> 0:21:54,99
breeder reactor. In August 1973, the Phenix
reactor in France achieved critically. So,


259
0:21:54,99 --> 0:21:59,89
we had real competition in this area and I
think it had something to do with the zeal


260
0:21:59,89 --> 0:22:3,85
the United States felt to become preeminent
in this field. But then something else happened


261
0:22:3,85 --> 0:22:9,73
in 1973 that was far more significant. The
Yom Kippur war started, it led to the OPEC


262
0:22:9,73 --> 0:22:15,6
oil Embargo. Suddenly, the United States,
their supply of oil was cut back tremendously.


263
0:22:15,6 --> 0:22:20,71
There were long lines, gas stations, people
were having to alternate days when they could


264
0:22:20,71 --> 0:22:26,9
buy gas, people were--somebody's not able
to get to work, enormous amount of economic


265
0:22:26,9 --> 0:22:31,95
activity which truncated. Nixon felt great
pressure so, he announced project independence


266
0:22:31,95 --> 0:22:36,4
which was a plan to make the United States
energy independent by 1980. This involved


267
0:22:36,4 --> 0:22:41,48
building many fast breeder reactors, many
conventional reactors, new oil drilling, new


268
0:22:41,48 --> 0:22:48,33
refineries, new coalmines, all kinds of things
to make the United States independent in energy


269
0:22:48,33 --> 0:22:53,37
supply. He promoted these in talks before
congress but then in March of 1974, the oil


270
0:22:53,37 --> 0:22:59,81
Embargo ended and pressure reduced to implement
project independence. But something else happened


271
0:22:59,81 --> 0:23:5,53
that was very significant in 1974. India detonated
a nuclear weapon that had been built from


272
0:23:5,53 --> 0:23:11,6
Plutonium separated from natural Uranium and
a heavy water reactor. This was a very significant


273
0:23:11,6 --> 0:23:16,17
event in the history of how the United States
approached nuclear power because they became


274
0:23:16,17 --> 0:23:22,45
quite fearful, the Plutonium that could be
separated from Uranium in reprocessing facilities


275
0:23:22,45 --> 0:23:27,86
would be able to be used in a nuclear weapon.
And there are many arguments why that is not


276
0:23:27,86 --> 0:23:33,15
feasible in conventional light water nuclear
reactors, but there are also other arguments


277
0:23:33,15 --> 0:23:38,59
on how changes on how you would put fuel through
a reactor could lead to, so called Weapons


278
0:23:38,59 --> 0:23:43,24
Grade Plutonium, rather than what we call,
Reactor Grade Plutonium which is not suitable


279
0:23:43,24 --> 0:23:49,23
for nuclear weapons. The entire fast breeder
program was partially built on the assumption


280
0:23:49,23 --> 0:23:53,3
that separated Plutonium would be available
from the light water reactors that we had


281
0:23:53,3 --> 0:23:57,13
already built. If we were able to take that
Plutonium out, we would be able to start these


282
0:23:57,13 --> 0:24:2,31
fast breeder reactors because they required
significantly more nuclear fuel to turn them


283
0:24:2,31 --> 0:24:7,22
on than a light water reactor did. And that
had to do with those relative cross-sections


284
0:24:7,22 --> 0:24:12,81
I showed, how big the Plutonium cross-section
was in the thermal reactor versus how small


285
0:24:12,81 --> 0:24:18,67
it was in the fast reactor. That's why it
takes so much more fuel to start a fast breeder


286
0:24:18,67 --> 0:24:24,27
reactor for the same electrical power rating
than a thermal reactor. Nixon resigned in


287
0:24:24,27 --> 0:24:28,87
1974 and Gerald Ford became the President.
He put some changes in place for the atomic


288
0:24:28,87 --> 0:24:33,44
energy commission, splitting it into two new
divisions, the nuclear regulatory commission


289
0:24:33,44 --> 0:24:38,62
and the energy research and development administration
which would go on to become the DOE. The joint


290
0:24:38,62 --> 0:24:43,29
congressional committee in atomic energy lead
by Chet Holifield was abolished, the balance


291
0:24:43,29 --> 0:24:49,67
of power which changed when Ford came in,
in 1974 and made these changes to the AEC


292
0:24:49,67 --> 0:24:54,1
and to the congressional committee. But Ford
still supported the fast breeder reactor.


293
0:24:54,1 --> 0:24:58,69
He mentioned it in several of his speeches
including in State of the Union Address. He


294
0:24:58,69 --> 0:25:4,26
increased funding for RND for the fast breeder
reactor. And he highlighted how the fast breeder


295
0:25:4,26 --> 0:25:9,35
reactor could be used to extend Uranium resources
for centuries. As the 1976 election approached


296
0:25:9,35 --> 0:25:17,52
though, it was very close between Jimmy Carter
and Gerald Ford. Jimmy Carter wanted Uranium


297
0:25:17,52 --> 0:25:22,94
reprocessing to be abolished. He did not want
it to take place. Only about a week before


298
0:25:22,94 --> 0:25:29,13
the election, on October 28th, 1976, Ford
took Carter's position. He said, "We are not


299
0:25:29,13 --> 0:25:34,12
going to reprocess Uranium anymore. We're
not going to separate Plutonium," and he highlighted


300
0:25:34,12 --> 0:25:39,72
the risk of proliferation as one of the main
reasons why he was making this decision. But


301
0:25:39,72 --> 0:25:45,55
it's almost certain that pressure from Carter
and an attempt to improve his potential to


302
0:25:45,55 --> 0:25:50,52
win the 1976s election had to have something
to do with it. At that time, the proposal


303
0:25:50,52 --> 0:25:55,2
was to build another fast breeder reactor.
This time in Tennessee, very close to Oak


304
0:25:55,2 --> 0:26:0,59
Ridge on the Clinch River, so this was the
proposal that was before the nation as Jimmy


305
0:26:0,59 --> 0:26:7,96
Carter became the President in 1977. And Carter
was not a supporter of this fast breeder reactor.


306
0:26:7,96 --> 0:26:13,86
He considered that the fast breeder reactor
and its concentration had something to do


307
0:26:13,86 --> 0:26:18,84
with the lack of technology development and
solar energy. He blamed the focus that had


308
0:26:18,84 --> 0:26:23,85
been on the fast breeder reactor. He called
our society a Plutonium society that would


309
0:26:23,85 --> 0:26:30,48
use the fast breeder reactor. In April, he
reiterated Ford's ban on reprocessing. So,


310
0:26:30,48 --> 0:26:34,81
not too much of a surprise, Ford had basically
assumed Carter's position, Carter's says,


311
0:26:34,81 --> 0:26:40,39
"Yes, we will continue that as National Policy."
He also calls for a cut back and funding for


312
0:26:40,39 --> 0:26:44,78
the Clinch River breeder reactor. However,
he announced a new energy plan, focused less


313
0:26:44,78 --> 0:26:49,75
on petroleum and more on coal. He said, "There's
no need to enter the Plutonium age by licensing


314
0:26:49,75 --> 0:26:53,98
or building a fast breeder reactor such as
the proposed demonstration plan at Clinch


315
0:26:53,98 --> 0:26:58,23
River." And again, he blamed the emphasis
on the breeder reactor for slow progress made


316
0:26:58,23 --> 0:27:3,47
in the progress of solar power. Surprisingly,
Carter knew a thing or two about Thorium.


317
0:27:3,47 --> 0:27:9,44
And the reason he did is because at this time,
Admiral Rickover was working with his neighbor


318
0:27:9,44 --> 0:27:15,25
reactors branch to load a Thorium Dioxide
Uranium-233 Dioxide core into the shipping


319
0:27:15,25 --> 0:27:21,41
port reactor. Carter was able to turn the
switch that turned the first and only Thorium


320
0:27:21,41 --> 0:27:26,67
breeder reactor in US history on. Several
times he mentioned how--we wanted to try other


321
0:27:26,67 --> 0:27:32,25
approaches to breeder reactors than Plutonium,
specifically light water breeder reactors


322
0:27:32,25 --> 0:27:37,18
using Uranium. But then, a meltdown happened
a Three Mile Island, public confidence in


323
0:27:37,18 --> 0:27:41,65
nuclear energy in particular the light water
reactor really went down. Even after Ronald


324
0:27:41,65 --> 0:27:47,95
Reagan was elected and lifted the ban on commercial
reprocessing, no reprocessing plans were built.


325
0:27:47,95 --> 0:27:51,85
In 1982, the shipping port reactor which had
been running for five years at this point


326
0:27:51,85 --> 0:27:56,76
on the Thorium, Uranium-233 core were shut
down. And when they examined the fuel, they


327
0:27:56,76 --> 0:28:2,69
found that there was 1% more fuel in the reactor
than there was when they started. This proved


328
0:28:2,69 --> 0:28:8,2
finally a Thorium breeder reactor was possible
in a thermal spectrum. It had actually been


329
0:28:8,2 --> 0:28:14,18
done. It wasn't a Thorium molten-salt reactor,
but it was a true Thorium breeder reactor.


330
0:28:14,18 --> 0:28:19,51
Another consequence of the decision not to
reprocess nuclear fuel meant that we had to


331
0:28:19,51 --> 0:28:25,18
have a new strategy for the long-term disposal
of Plutonium. Previously had been assumed


332
0:28:25,18 --> 0:28:29,49
that Plutonium from light water reactors would
be sent to fast breeder reactors but without


333
0:28:29,49 --> 0:28:34,14
that, we need to know what to do. And so President
Reagan sign in the Nuclear Waste Policy Act,


334
0:28:34,14 --> 0:28:38,1
which continues to be the law of the land
till this day, and led to things like the


335
0:28:38,1 --> 0:28:43,12
[INDISTINCT] repository. The funding that
went into the fast breeder reactor surprisingly


336
0:28:43,12 --> 0:28:49,59
peaked even after the United States had made
the decision not to continue with reprocessing.


337
0:28:49,59 --> 0:28:53,97
And even under the Carter years, from 1976
to 1980, you can see funding levels for the


338
0:28:53,97 --> 0:28:59,46
fast breeder were very high. So, this was
a reactor type that dominated the long range


339
0:28:59,46 --> 0:29:4,82
planning of the United States for many, many
years. The atomic energy commission saw Plutonium


340
0:29:4,82 --> 0:29:10,38
as a sure bet in the fast breeder. It could
cross the Threshold of Two. There wasn't uncertainty


341
0:29:10,38 --> 0:29:15,45
there. There was a degree of uncertainty with
Thorium. They invested early and heavily in


342
0:29:15,45 --> 0:29:20,55
the fast breeder reactor, despite failures
and meltdowns, and industry got involved with


343
0:29:20,55 --> 0:29:27,58
hundreds of millions of dollars of investment.
In 1971 Nixon, made this the US strategy,


344
0:29:27,58 --> 0:29:31,22
how are we going to go forward? It was going
to be based around the fast breeder, and shortly


345
0:29:31,22 --> 0:29:35,44
thereafter, Weinberg was fired and the molten-salt
reactor program was cancelled. Before it cancelled


346
0:29:35,44 --> 0:29:40,38
the fuel processing program and Carter extended
that ban, without fuel reprocessing, the fast


347
0:29:40,38 --> 0:29:47,59
breeder was not a viable candidate anymore.
And nobody as far as we know in DC ever revisited


348
0:29:47,59 --> 0:29:52,65
the question of, "Was it a mistake to cancel
the molten-salt reactor effort?" Should we


349
0:29:52,65 --> 0:29:55,809
have gone back and said, "You know, now that
we're not going to do the fast breeder, maybe


350
0:29:55,809 --> 0:30:0,1
we should've done the molten-salt breeder
reactor." In all of my studies, I have not


351
0:30:0,1 --> 0:30:5,23
been able to find any indication that, that
ever took place, that there was a true revisiting


352
0:30:5,23 --> 0:30:11,1
of that decision to shut down and a rethinking.
The team that worked on this at Oak Ridge


353
0:30:11,1 --> 0:30:15,73
disbanded and dispersed. And over the decades
that fall the notch was totally forgotten.


354
0:30:15,73 --> 0:30:21,91
So now, here we are in 2011 asking, "Why is
now the right time for the Liquid Fluoride


355
0:30:21,91 --> 0:30:26,82
Thorium Reactor, which is the modern form
of the Thorium molten-salt reactor originally


356
0:30:26,82 --> 0:30:31,75
proposed?" We know that we need much more
energy at much lower prices. And we have to


357
0:30:31,75 --> 0:30:36,99
do this with a much lower impact on the earth's
environment. We know that we're facing severe


358
0:30:36,99 --> 0:30:43,3
challenges from global climate change, melting
of glaciers, rising sea levels, changing weather


359
0:30:43,3 --> 0:30:47,19
patterns. We need to reduce the amount of
carbon dioxide we're putting into the atmosphere


360
0:30:47,19 --> 0:30:53,66
dramatically. There's tremendous uncertainty
amongst the public about nuclear power because


361
0:30:53,66 --> 0:30:58,429
of the events of Akushima Daichi, even though
no one was killed there. The coverage and


362
0:30:58,429 --> 0:31:3,429
the tone that it took has made people question
the safety of nuclear power, primarily the


363
0:31:3,429 --> 0:31:9,66
light water reactor to be able to have a different
technology that doesn't have some of the risks


364
0:31:9,66 --> 0:31:15,53
of operating high pressure fluids and reactors
that have the capability to have meltdowns.


365
0:31:15,53 --> 0:31:20,33
It's significant. Our alternatives in the
form of fossil fuel caused tremendous environmental


366
0:31:20,33 --> 0:31:26,16
degradation, not just in mining and processing,
but also to our atmosphere, transporting these


367
0:31:26,16 --> 0:31:30,76
fuels. It's not cheap to build electrical
power transmission lines either. So, even


368
0:31:30,76 --> 0:31:35,42
if we wanted to build renewable energy sources
dispersed in a wide variety of places, they


369
0:31:35,42 --> 0:31:40,11
would face challenges in order to get transmission
lines built from here to there. To give you


370
0:31:40,11 --> 0:31:44,309
an idea of just some of the things we do in
our high-tech online society today, this is


371
0:31:44,309 --> 0:31:49,32
a picture of a data center for Facebook that
has been built just a hundred miles south


372
0:31:49,32 --> 0:31:55,3
of the Arctic Circle in Sweden. It consumes
a hundred and twenty megawatts of hydro power,


373
0:31:55,3 --> 0:32:2,91
has 14 backup diesel generators to provide
40 megawatts of emergency power. It costs


374
0:32:2,91 --> 0:32:7,23
$760,000,000. This is one of the largest solar
installations in the world. It's sited on


375
0:32:7,23 --> 0:32:12,5
a hundred and eighty-five hectares of land.
It provides 20 megawatts of peak energy for


376
0:32:12,5 --> 0:32:20,23
15 hours a day at $420,000,000, or about $33
a watt. That's six to seven times what it


377
0:32:20,23 --> 0:32:25,309
cost to put other power transmission in. So,
this is in Spain and the data center is in


378
0:32:25,309 --> 0:32:30,38
Sweden. So, here is an example of a customer
that has a dense power demand that wants continuous


379
0:32:30,38 --> 0:32:35,57
power, no interruptions and it's in frozen
Sweden and here is a diffused power supply


380
0:32:35,57 --> 0:32:42,77
in Spain. So, to run this building of those
solar power systems, we'll need at least six,


381
0:32:42,77 --> 0:32:46,53
but we need more because these plants can
only provide power for 15 hours a day. So,


382
0:32:46,53 --> 0:32:52,59
we'll need probably 10 or more of these sites
to run one of these data centers. Plus, we'll


383
0:32:52,59 --> 0:32:56,45
need intercontinental transmission lines to
get power from a place like Spain, that's


384
0:32:56,45 --> 0:33:0,929
nice and sunny, to a place like Sweden that's
frozen. Is this what's going to happen? Probably


385
0:33:0,929 --> 0:33:5,66
not, probably what will happen is something
more like this, where a dense power supply


386
0:33:5,66 --> 0:33:9,679
in the form of coal. This is the prettiest
coal plant I've ever seen in my life. This


387
0:33:9,679 --> 0:33:16,3
is in Germany. But it provides 1600 megawatts
of continuous power by burning lignite coal.


388
0:33:16,3 --> 0:33:22,97
Look at that, we could run 13 of those data
centers with one of these coal plants. Sounds


389
0:33:22,97 --> 0:33:27,61
great right? Well unless you're the environment.
If we try to use expensive intermittent and


390
0:33:27,61 --> 0:33:32,26
alternative energy, it's not going to be the
answer. Most populations, most people on earth


391
0:33:32,26 --> 0:33:38,77
can't afford unsubsidized alternative energy.
It's just too expensive. What they'll go towards


392
0:33:38,77 --> 0:33:44,63
is cheap, reliable, dirty energy. That's not
a viable answer for the world either. But


393
0:33:44,63 --> 0:33:48,25
it's the one that will be taken because most
people don't have alternatives. We believe


394
0:33:48,25 --> 0:33:53,559
natural, inexpensive, and abundant Thorium
is the answer. This is the material that is


395
0:33:53,559 --> 0:33:58,25
dense enough and reliable enough to provide
the energy that the world needs, but the machine


396
0:33:58,25 --> 0:34:4,54
to make it work is the key. Why molten-salt?
Because molten-salt is the only one of the


397
0:34:4,54 --> 0:34:9,579
four potential coolants in the reactor that
can run at both high temperature and low pressure.


398
0:34:9,579 --> 0:34:14,339
It also has a remarkable feature because of
the properties of molten-salt. In the event


399
0:34:14,339 --> 0:34:20,89
of an emergency, the fuel could be drained
into a passively safe, passively cool configuration.


400
0:34:20,89 --> 0:34:24,519
This is something that you can't do with a
solid-fueled reactor. Finally, the advantages


401
0:34:24,519 --> 0:34:28,989
of the molten-salt reactor are significant,
inherent passive safety through having fluid


402
0:34:28,989 --> 0:34:32,72
fuel and operating at low pressure. You can
operate at high temperatures, which means


403
0:34:32,72 --> 0:34:37,839
you can get high thermodynamic efficiencies.
Your fuel preparation costs are very low and


404
0:34:37,839 --> 0:34:42,559
there's no fuel fabrication cost. Fluorides
also tried to be an excellent chemistry match


405
0:34:42,559 --> 0:34:47,509
with Uranium Thorium Fuel Cycle. They're chemically
stable and they're impervious to radiation


406
0:34:47,509 --> 0:34:52,569
damage. That enables us to achieve unlimited
fuel burn up and continuous recycling of the


407
0:34:52,569 --> 0:34:58,239
material from core to blanket. Uranium-233
is highly unsuitable for weapons diversion


408
0:34:58,239 --> 0:35:3,42
because of contamination with Uranium-232.
And it's easy to down blend it in an emergency.


409
0:35:3,42 --> 0:35:8,489
Now, we do have challenges. These salts could
be aggressive towards most metal construction


410
0:35:8,489 --> 0:35:15,14
materials. It requires special materials to
avoid being corroded by the salt. High temperature


411
0:35:15,14 --> 0:35:21,4
operation is also both a blessing and a challenge.
But I think the fact that the technology base


412
0:35:21,4 --> 0:35:26,9
is largely stagnated for 40 years is our single
greatest challenge towards going forward,


413
0:35:26,9 --> 0:35:31,2
and also the unknown nature of this within
the nuclear community. It's very different


414
0:35:31,2 --> 0:35:36,249
than what we do today with water cooled Uranium
fueled reactors. They are the basis for today's


415
0:35:36,249 --> 0:35:40,73
regulatory environment. And so, there will
be a great deal of education needed for this


416
0:35:40,73 --> 0:35:45,769
technology to go forward. But I think it has
great potential because of these attributes.


417
0:35:45,769 --> 0:35:49,89
And five energy aspires to be the world leader
in the design, development, and manufacture


418
0:35:49,89 --> 0:37:49,89
of these liquid fluoride Thorium reactors.
Thank you very much.
