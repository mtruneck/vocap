every weekend.

Every Friday nights, I'll be
competing at Cave Creek, out


5
0:0:31,7 --> 0:0:35,52
by Phoenix, Arizona at a place
called Buffalo Chip.


6
0:0:35,52 --> 0:0:38,961
And I pretty much go over there
because they pay pretty


7
0:0:38,961 --> 0:0:39,38
good money.


8
0:0:39,38 --> 0:0:42,9
Then Saturdays and Sundays, I
would just go anywhere where


9
0:0:42,9 --> 0:0:44,13
they would have bull ridings.

There will probably be quite
a bit of people.

Quite a bit of spectators.


14
0:0:50,31 --> 0:0:53,58
So it should be a pretty
good turnout tonight.


15
0:0:53,58 --> 0:0:57,4
I was entered in a bull ride
in Encienta, and the bull


16
0:0:57,4 --> 0:0:59,277
stepped right on the
back of my head.


17
0:0:59,277 --> 0:1:1,712
And he knocked me out.


18
0:1:1,712 --> 0:1:4,147
And then he hit his horn right
on the back of my head.


19
0:1:4,147 --> 0:1:6,95
And then he stepped on me.


20
0:1:6,95 --> 0:1:10,62
And I was flown out to
Flagstaff, Arizona.


21
0:1:10,62 --> 0:1:14,23
And I didn't come through
until two days later.


22
0:1:14,23 --> 0:1:18,5

32
0:1:39,21 --> 0:1:41,12

33
0:1:41,12 --> 0:1:41,96
I got on this white horse.


34
0:1:41,96 --> 0:1:44,55
I'd been on him before
at that same rodeo.


35
0:1:44,55 --> 0:1:49,19
I'd got on the horse, maybe
about a good four seconds.


36
0:1:49,19 --> 0:1:50,34
He reared up.


37
0:1:50,34 --> 0:1:52,81
And then he fell on
me backwards.


38
0:1:52,81 --> 0:1:54,31
I got hung up too.


39
0:1:54,31 --> 0:1:55,63
On that horse.


40
0:1:55,63 --> 0:2:1,75
I fell off the wrong way and I
got hung up for maybe a good


41
0:2:1,75 --> 0:2:2,803
six minutes.


42
0:2:2,803 --> 0:2:5,952
That was a very long time.


43
0:2:5,952 --> 0:2:7,52
It happened real
fast, you know?
