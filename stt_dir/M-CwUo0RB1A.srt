0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:5,928



2
0:0:5,928 --> 0:0:7,41
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, you can
see it [INAUDIBLE].


3
0:0:7,41 --> 0:0:10,374



4
0:0:10,374 --> 0:0:10,868
MIKE CARROLL: All right.


5
0:0:10,868 --> 0:0:11,856
Way to go, huh?


6
0:0:11,856 --> 0:0:13,832
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.


7
0:0:13,832 --> 0:0:14,326
MIKE CARROLL: All right.


8
0:0:14,326 --> 0:0:15,314
What's up, dude?


9
0:0:15,314 --> 0:0:16,302
MALE SPEAKER: What's up?


10
0:0:16,302 --> 0:0:17,784
MIKE CARROLL: All right.


11
0:0:17,784 --> 0:0:18,78
What's happening?


12
0:0:18,78 --> 0:0:19,46
PATRICK O'DELL: What's up?


13
0:0:19,46 --> 0:0:20,355
Welcome back to the show.


14
0:0:20,355 --> 0:0:21,51
We're here at Deluxe.


15
0:0:21,51 --> 0:0:24,71
We're meeting up with Girl and
Anti-Hero, and we're going on


16
0:0:24,71 --> 0:0:27,73
the Beauty and the Beast Tour,
which is through northern


17
0:0:27,73 --> 0:0:30,54
California, Oregon,
Washington.


18
0:0:30,54 --> 0:0:32,61
And I've never been on tour
with either of these


19
0:0:32,61 --> 0:0:36,88
companies, so I'm kind of
nervous and excited.


20
0:0:36,88 --> 0:0:38,66
Because it seems to be
more than just like


21
0:0:38,66 --> 0:0:39,7
a regular old tour.


22
0:0:39,7 --> 0:0:42,189
This is like a really
sick tour.


23
0:0:42,189 --> 0:0:43,95
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.


24
0:0:43,95 --> 0:0:45,37
You've got to wear like
smaller pants or


25
0:0:45,37 --> 0:0:46,4
whatever with that one.


26
0:0:46,4 --> 0:0:48,18
PATRICK O'DELL: You're going
to wear all Anti-Hero gear?


27
0:0:48,18 --> 0:0:48,885
MIKE CARROLL: Yeah.


28
0:0:48,885 --> 0:0:52,62
And they're going to wear our
all-over print Girl gear.


29
0:0:52,62 --> 0:0:55,5
MALE SPEAKER: This one
fits better, right?


30
0:0:55,5 --> 0:0:56,91
PATRICK O'DELL: You guys
trading outfits?


31
0:0:56,91 --> 0:0:57,63
AARON MEZA: No.


32
0:0:57,63 --> 0:1:0,196
That's just Mike's
weird fantasies.


33
0:1:0,196 --> 0:1:1,53
PATRICK O'DELL: Oh.


34
0:1:1,53 --> 0:1:2,675
Do you think Girl and Anti-Hero


35
0:1:2,675 --> 0:1:4,378
have anything in common?


36
0:1:4,378 --> 0:1:7,55
JIM THIEBAUD: Yeah, they're both
awesome skateboard teams.


37
0:1:7,55 --> 0:1:9,29
They're the dudes.


38
0:1:9,29 --> 0:1:12,1
They know what they're doing.


39
0:1:12,1 --> 0:1:13,94
I think they're similar in the
fact that they're just both


40
0:1:13,94 --> 0:1:16,81
all run by the guys who ride
for them, and that shows in


41
0:1:16,81 --> 0:1:17,9
everything they do.


42
0:1:17,9 --> 0:1:20,69
And this was an awesome idea,
that I can't wait to fucking


43
0:1:20,69 --> 0:1:21,67
see what happens.


44
0:1:21,67 --> 0:1:23,17
I was talking to Julian.


45
0:1:23,17 --> 0:1:25,267
It feels like the last couple
of days we were calling each


46
0:1:25,267 --> 0:1:27,97
other and just like, can you
believe this is happening?


47
0:1:27,97 --> 0:1:28,245
You ready?


48
0:1:28,245 --> 0:1:28,69
Are you ready?


49
0:1:28,69 --> 0:1:32,9
And to me it feels like it's
almost like a big video


50
0:1:32,9 --> 0:1:34,83
premiere, or some bullshit thing
where you're like, oh my


51
0:1:34,83 --> 0:1:35,86
god, it's going to happen.


52
0:1:35,86 --> 0:1:38,415
And I can't fucking wait.


53
0:1:38,415 --> 0:1:39,405
It's going to be really cool.


54
0:1:39,405 --> 0:1:39,9
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.


55
0:1:39,9 --> 0:1:41,11
PATRICK O'DELL: It's a
10-day trip, right?


56
0:1:41,11 --> 0:1:44,56
And there's only like three
things on the schedule.


57
0:1:44,56 --> 0:1:47,23
JIM THIEBAUD: As it should be.


58
0:1:47,23 --> 0:1:49,49
I'm sure it'll be filled
with other


59
0:1:49,49 --> 0:1:50,935
things rather than demos.


60
0:1:50,935 --> 0:1:55,864



61
0:1:55,864 --> 0:1:57,114
MALE SPEAKER: How you doing?


62
0:1:57,114 --> 0:1:59,832



63
0:1:59,832 --> 0:2:1,32
MALE SPEAKER: Is
this your dog?


64
0:2:1,32 --> 0:2:3,8
[LAUGHTER]


65
0:2:3,8 --> 0:2:4,792
ROBBIE RUSSO: Look
at the poop.


66
0:2:4,792 --> 0:2:5,784
It just peed on the floor.


67
0:2:5,784 --> 0:2:8,32
MALE SPEAKER: Oh, shit.


68
0:2:8,32 --> 0:2:9,36
PATRICK O'DELL: Where'd
you get that tent?


69
0:2:9,36 --> 0:2:10,689
ROBBIE RUSSO: At
the dog store.


70
0:2:10,689 --> 0:2:11,84
PATRICK O'DELL: The dog store?


71
0:2:11,84 --> 0:2:12,828
ROBBIE RUSSO: I don't know.


72
0:2:12,828 --> 0:2:14,31
Dog something.


73
0:2:14,31 --> 0:2:15,35
PATRICK O'DELL: What do
you think Girl and


74
0:2:15,35 --> 0:2:16,89
Anti-Hero have in common?


75
0:2:16,89 --> 0:2:17,49
TONY MIORANA: Legendary dudes.


76
0:2:17,49 --> 0:2:19,272
Skater of the years.


77
0:2:19,272 --> 0:2:22,74
They got several of those.


78
0:2:22,74 --> 0:2:23,53
Sick-ass teams.


79
0:2:23,53 --> 0:2:25,81
Good people to hang out with.


80
0:2:25,81 --> 0:2:27,89
They've both got roots.


81
0:2:27,89 --> 0:2:30,606
They've got deep roots
in skating.


82
0:2:30,606 --> 0:2:32,91
You respect all the
dudes who started


83
0:2:32,91 --> 0:2:36,28
both of those companies.


84
0:2:36,28 --> 0:2:38,1
JOHN ALDEN: Fuck, seems like we
were talking about it for a


85
0:2:38,1 --> 0:2:40,2
long time, like just
bullshitting.


86
0:2:40,2 --> 0:2:42,52
Like it would be so sick to
fucking go out with those


87
0:2:42,52 --> 0:2:44,55
dudes, just kind
of like joking.


88
0:2:44,55 --> 0:2:48,54
Somehow it fucking worked out.


89
0:2:48,54 --> 0:2:51,34
DARIN HOWARD: This is a trip I'd
love to be on, like a fly


90
0:2:51,34 --> 0:2:52,634
on the wall.


91
0:2:52,634 --> 0:2:54,844
Fuck, it's going to be nuts.


92
0:2:54,844 --> 0:2:55,29
Yeah.


93
0:2:55,29 --> 0:2:57,76
Once in a lifetime kind
of thing, you know?


94
0:2:57,76 --> 0:3:3,28



95
0:3:3,28 --> 0:3:3,524
MALE SPEAKER: Girl!


96
0:3:3,524 --> 0:3:4,516
Arr.


97
0:3:4,516 --> 0:3:6,996
[HOWLS AND CHEERS]


98
0:3:6,996 --> 0:3:9,972



99
0:3:9,972 --> 0:3:12,948
[HORN HONKS]


100
0:3:12,948 --> 0:3:14,436
MALE SPEAKER: Hopefully
we make it back.


101
0:3:14,436 --> 0:3:28,82



102
0:3:28,82 --> 0:3:32,292
RICK HOWARD: Fuck yeah, dude.


103
0:3:32,292 --> 0:3:33,78
Wow.


104
0:3:33,78 --> 0:3:34,772
This is nice.


105
0:3:34,772 --> 0:3:36,756
What's up, Tony?


106
0:3:36,756 --> 0:3:37,82
Yeah, dude.


107
0:3:37,82 --> 0:3:39,1
I'm good.


108
0:3:39,1 --> 0:3:39,435
TONY TRUJILLO: I'm good.


109
0:3:39,435 --> 0:3:41,34
I'm doing it.


110
0:3:41,34 --> 0:3:42,741
Fucking get some
of that, dude.


111
0:3:42,741 --> 0:3:44,705
RICK HOWARD: Yeah, that's
fucking mysterious


112
0:3:44,705 --> 0:3:45,955
[INAUDIBLE].


113
0:3:45,955 --> 0:4:4,84



114
0:4:4,84 --> 0:4:8,22
PATRICK O'DELL: So whose idea
was this for the tour?


115
0:4:8,22 --> 0:4:9,31
JULIEN STRANGER: It
was their idea.


116
0:4:9,31 --> 0:4:13,35
A couple years ago it came up as
like Anti-Hero versus Girl,


117
0:4:13,35 --> 0:4:16,29
and I was way not into that,
because we'd just get our ass


118
0:4:16,29 --> 0:4:18,55
kicked all over the place.


119
0:4:18,55 --> 0:4:24,53
It kind of took a couple years
to find the right plan.


120
0:4:24,53 --> 0:4:27,17
When I was on teams when I was
a lot younger, I was always


121
0:4:27,17 --> 0:4:30,28
really stoked on the
team aspect, like a


122
0:4:30,28 --> 0:4:31,99
good group of friends.


123
0:4:31,99 --> 0:4:35,67
And that was more important than
necessarily how good a


124
0:4:35,67 --> 0:4:37,3
guy was, or if they won
contests or anything.


125
0:4:37,3 --> 0:4:39,8
It was just like you had to get
the right people together.


126
0:4:39,8 --> 0:4:40,79
And I think that's what
these guys do.


127
0:4:40,79 --> 0:4:42,562
I think that's what we do.


128
0:4:42,562 --> 0:4:44,85
You don't treat skaters
like meat.


129
0:4:44,85 --> 0:4:45,89
They're not pro athletes.


130
0:4:45,89 --> 0:4:47,28
They're friends.


131
0:4:47,28 --> 0:4:50,27
Both companies really care about
skateboarding, and just


132
0:4:50,27 --> 0:4:52,4
want to keep it really
interesting for people like


133
0:4:52,4 --> 0:4:56,28
ourselves, for our peers, not
just create a commodity.


134
0:4:56,28 --> 0:4:59,2
It's everything more
than money.


135
0:4:59,2 --> 0:5:2,91
And these guys wanted to unwind
after the Lakai thing,


136
0:5:2,91 --> 0:5:4,46
after all the pressure they
put themselves through the


137
0:5:4,46 --> 0:5:4,92
Lakai thing.


138
0:5:4,92 --> 0:5:7,48
So I think it's just to blow off
a lot of steam for them,


139
0:5:7,48 --> 0:5:9,18
and a chance for all
of us to go skate.


140
0:5:9,18 --> 0:5:10,43
RICK HOWARD: Yeah.


141
0:5:10,43 --> 0:5:13,97



142
0:5:13,97 --> 0:5:15,73
MIKE CARROLL: Probably a few
months before, we had just


143
0:5:15,73 --> 0:5:16,57
finished Fully Flared.


144
0:5:16,57 --> 0:5:19,77
So the Beauty and the Beast trip
was pretty much like a


145
0:5:19,77 --> 0:5:22,15
vacation with skateboards
and stuff, so


146
0:5:22,15 --> 0:5:24,895
it was pretty awesome.


147
0:5:24,895 --> 0:5:30,28
And it was just like a, ah, I
like skateboarding again, type


148
0:5:30,28 --> 0:5:31,53
of feeling.


149
0:5:31,53 --> 0:5:35,67



150
0:5:35,67 --> 0:5:38,19
ALEX OLSON: I don't know, this
one just was like, let's go on


151
0:5:38,19 --> 0:5:39,35
a trip and go skate.


152
0:5:39,35 --> 0:5:42,69
It was like going with
all your buddies.


153
0:5:42,69 --> 0:5:46,94
No one cared about getting
photos or tricks, and just


154
0:5:46,94 --> 0:5:49,69
like everyone wanted
just to go skate.


155
0:5:49,69 --> 0:5:53,57
Which was super nice compared
to the last couple


156
0:5:53,57 --> 0:5:55,465
of trips I was on.


157
0:5:55,465 --> 0:5:58,99
I was filming Gnarly for
the Lakai trips.


158
0:5:58,99 --> 0:6:14,65



159
0:6:14,65 --> 0:6:17,9
Personally, I thought like
everyone on both teams wanted


160
0:6:17,9 --> 0:6:20,27
to put the right impression
for each other.


161
0:6:20,27 --> 0:6:23,2
So everyone was walking on
eggshells at first, and you're


162
0:6:23,2 --> 0:6:24,47
kind of nervous, like
you don't know


163
0:6:24,47 --> 0:6:26,3
what's going to happen.


164
0:6:26,3 --> 0:6:28,86
We've never been on a trip
with these guys.


165
0:6:28,86 --> 0:6:30,6
We don't know how they roll.


166
0:6:30,6 --> 0:6:32,76
MALE SPEAKER: Woo.


167
0:6:32,76 --> 0:6:35,3
Three beers out.


168
0:6:35,3 --> 0:6:36,845
ALEX OLSON: Yeah, everyone I
think was like tripping, like


169
0:6:36,845 --> 0:6:39,62
whoa, because everyone
respected everyone.


170
0:6:39,62 --> 0:6:41,14
I've never hung out with
John before, or


171
0:6:41,14 --> 0:6:42,9
talked to him, really.


172
0:6:42,9 --> 0:6:44,19
Maybe seen John a couple times.


173
0:6:44,19 --> 0:6:45,37
I'm like--


174
0:6:45,37 --> 0:6:47,42
or like went around the corner,
and I was like, ooh,


175
0:6:47,42 --> 0:6:48,67
that's John Cardiel.


176
0:6:48,67 --> 0:7:1,726



177
0:7:1,726 --> 0:7:2,222
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.


178
0:7:2,222 --> 0:7:3,214
JOHN CARDIEL: What's
up, fellas?


179
0:7:3,214 --> 0:7:5,198
MALE SPEAKER: Got to do your
chores before you leave.


180
0:7:5,198 --> 0:7:5,694
JOHN CARDIEL: Yeah, man.


181
0:7:5,694 --> 0:7:6,19
I was thinking.


182
0:7:6,19 --> 0:7:7,182
I was like, you know what?


183
0:7:7,182 --> 0:7:7,678
I don't want to come back--


184
0:7:7,678 --> 0:7:8,67
MALE SPEAKER: And have
a [INAUDIBLE]?


185
0:7:8,67 --> 0:7:11,21
JOHN CARDIEL: Yeah, and then it
gets caught in the fucking


186
0:7:11,21 --> 0:7:14,45
mower, and it stops
and everything.


187
0:7:14,45 --> 0:7:16,2
Bad one.


188
0:7:16,2 --> 0:7:20,11
Wood, it gets all locked up.


189
0:7:20,11 --> 0:7:22,56
ALEX OLSON: I think the Girl
guys were more intimidated by


190
0:7:22,56 --> 0:7:24,44
the Anti-Hero guys for sure.


191
0:7:24,44 --> 0:7:26,15
And then everyone got like
comfortable with everyone, and


192
0:7:26,15 --> 0:7:29,262
then it was super cool.


193
0:7:29,262 --> 0:7:30,25
SAM: Hey, John.


194
0:7:30,25 --> 0:7:31,238
JOHN CARDIEL: Yeah,
what up, Sam?


195
0:7:31,238 --> 0:7:31,732
SAM: Chilling, man.


196
0:7:31,732 --> 0:7:32,226
How are you?


197
0:7:32,226 --> 0:7:33,708
JOHN CARDIEL: Good,
good, good.


198
0:7:33,708 --> 0:7:34,202
John.


199
0:7:34,202 --> 0:7:34,696
MALE SPEAKER: John.


200
0:7:34,696 --> 0:7:35,946
JOHN CARDIEL: Nice
to meet you.


201
0:7:35,946 --> 0:7:38,65



202
0:7:38,65 --> 0:7:40,714
RICK MCCRANK: You guys like
Brazilian Super Juice?


203
0:7:40,714 --> 0:7:45,57



204
0:7:45,57 --> 0:7:46,82
ROBBIE RUSSO: Whoa.


205
0:7:46,82 --> 0:7:50,672



206
0:7:50,672 --> 0:7:51,905
MALE SPEAKER: We got
your cruiser, John.


207
0:7:51,905 --> 0:7:53,155
