0:0:24,42 --> 0:0:29,54
Finland is a land of forests and seemingly
endless countryside. Although it's inhabited


2
0:0:29,54 --> 0:0:31,67
by more
than 5 million people, more than a million


3
0:0:31,67 --> 0:0:33,96
of them live in the country's capital and
largest city,


4
0:0:33,96 --> 0:0:38,59
Helsinki. Helsinki is a unique and modern
city characterized by its artistry and its


5
0:0:38,59 --> 0:0:41,89
world famous
designs, as even the most functional buildings


6
0:0:41,89 --> 0:0:43,23
double as monuments to Finland's rich,
architectural history. It's an enchanting


7
0:0:43,23 --> 0:0:45,699
and other-worldly place and its beauty is
striking.


8
0:0:45,699 --> 0:0:50,39
But I didn't travel for over 24 hours just
to see what has to be the most stunning corner


9
0:0:50,39 --> 0:1:5,86
of the
continent. I came to drift Bentleys on ice.


10
0:1:5,86 --> 0:1:10,24
Eight years ago, Bentley began its Power on
Ice eventâ€” an outrageous excursion held


11
0:1:10,24 --> 0:1:10,95
near the
Arctic Circle where Bentley owners meet with


12
0:1:10,95 --> 0:1:15,95
skilled instructors and learn to power slide
Bentleys on an enormous frozen lake.


13
0:1:15,95 --> 0:1:20,45
The lake is divided into different handling
tracks and the drivers get seat time in a


14
0:1:20,45 --> 0:1:22,909
range of
Bentley Models, including the Continental


15
0:1:22,909 --> 0:1:27,49
Supersports, Continental GT W12, Continental
GT


16
0:1:27,49 --> 0:1:29,92
V8, and Continental Flying Spur Speed.


17
0:1:29,92 --> 0:1:33,92
The objective is to learn how to get the best
performance from a Bentley in the toughest


18
0:1:33,92 --> 0:1:36,17
of
natural driving conditions and to learn how


19
0:1:36,17 --> 0:1:38,99
to effectively execute controlled power slides
in one


20
0:1:38,99 --> 0:1:49,789
of the most exotic locations in the world.


21
0:1:49,789 --> 0:1:54,399
My first ice-drifting lesson began with Kristian
Sohlberg, a Finnish Rally Driver who has scored


22
0:1:54,399 --> 0:1:59,3
three World Rally Championship points during
his career. As he demonstrated what it takes


23
0:1:59,3 --> 0:2:0,95
to
execute a power-slide in this environment,


24
0:2:0,95 --> 0:2:3,74
it became immediately obvious that drifting
on ice is


25
0:2:3,74 --> 0:3:9,8
much different than drifting on a high-friction
asphalt road surface. On ice, the 
car begs to


26
0:3:9,8 --> 0:3:13,22
oversteer and the driver's job is to patiently
wait for the back end to lose grip and spin


27
0:3:13,22 --> 0:3:15,9
out before
gently applying throttle and counter-steer


28
0:3:15,9 --> 0:3:52,739
to complete 


29
0:3:52,739 --> 0:3:57,7
the turn. Too much throttle and you'll spin
out or find yourself pointed perpendicularly


30
0:3:57,7 --> 0:4:0,14
to the course. Too little throttle and you
won't make


31
0:4:0,14 --> 0:4:1,49
it through the turn.


32
0:4:1,49 --> 0:4:9,65
It's a controlled yet frenzied dance that
relies on your awareness of the vehicle's


33
0:4:9,65 --> 0:4:12,269
weight transfer,
your ability to correctly place the car in


34
0:4:12,269 --> 0:4:14,69
the corners, and your overall intuition. While
instructors


35
0:4:14,69 --> 0:4:19,829
can provide a great deal of information to
support your success, there's an intangible


36
0:4:19,829 --> 0:4:24,34
element that
can't be taughtâ€” the art of listening


37
0:4:24,34 --> 0:4:25,29
to how the car feels, understanding its tendencies,
and


38
0:4:25,29 --> 0:4:29,3
being able to anticipate its behavior on a
surface that offers absolutely no traction.


39
0:4:29,3 --> 0:4:34,77
It's a complex skill to say the least, but
when performed correctly, drifting on ice


40
0:4:34,77 --> 0:4:38,9
is possibly the
most exhilarating thrill you'll ever experience


41
0:4:38,9 --> 0:4:38,64
in your car.


42
0:4:38,64 --> 0:4:49,91
Throughout the day I 
had the opportunity to work with different
rally drivers, like Mark Higgins,


43
0:4:49,91 --> 0:4:54,4
a three-time British Rally Champion who served
as a stunt driver in the James Bond films


44
0:4:54,4 --> 0:5:0,76
Quantum of Solace and Sky Fall.


45
0:5:0,76 --> 0:5:9,91
I also spent time with Kris Meeke, a professional
rally driver and Intercontinental Rally


46
0:5:9,91 --> 0:5:16,11
Challenge Champion, who recently put a Continental
GT Speed through its paces at the WRC


47
0:5:16,11 --> 0:5:20,69
Rally GB on BBC Top Gear.


48
0:5:20,69 --> 0:5:24,39
Each helped me better understand the complexities
of ice-driving and gave me the chance to see


49
0:5:24,39 --> 0:6:30,1
the different ways professional drivers'
conceptualize this maneuver.


50
0:6:30,1 --> 0:6:34,71
My afternoon concluded in the best possible
of ways, with Hot Laps with a Finnish rally


51
0:6:34,71 --> 0:6:37,65
star
who's a four-time World Rally champion,


52
0:6:37,65 --> 0:8:1,68
modern-day Bentley Boy, and 
World Ice Speed
Record breaker, Juha Kankkunen.


53
0:8:1,68 --> 0:8:5,65
After spending a truly surreal afternoon on
the lake, we headed back to the cabins to


54
0:8:5,65 --> 0:8:7,77
prepare for
our evening adventure/outing which began with


55
0:8:7,77 --> 0:8:20,0
a husky safari dog sledding ride. I spent
the


56
0:8:20,0 --> 0:8:24,37
whole ride wondering if this was really happening,
and when we arrived at a reindeer farm,


57
0:8:24,37 --> 0:8:26,95
things became even more dreamlike.


58
0:8:26,95 --> 0:8:30,98
The reindeer farm was home to the Sami, a
distinct culture in Finland with a population


59
0:8:30,98 --> 0:8:33,5
between
6 and 8 thousand people who speak different


60
0:8:33,5 --> 0:8:37,88
dialects of the Sami language and who traditionally
herd reindeer. There, a man and his daughter


61
0:8:37,88 --> 0:8:40,18
taught us about Sami culture and introduced
us to


62
0:8:40,18 --> 0:8:43,169
their prized president reindeer. Then, it
was off to dinner, where we dined on Sami


63
0:8:43,169 --> 0:8:44,31
foods and
reveled in the extraordinary experience we'd


64
0:8:44,31 --> 0:8:44,88
had on the ice.


65
0:8:44,88 --> 0:8:49,43
This event was one I will never forget. From
the majestic beauty of the countryside to


66
0:8:49,43 --> 0:8:51,769
the sheer
thrill of drifting on ice and doing it in


67
0:8:51,769 --> 0:8:55,3
one of the world's most exquisite vehicles,
this trip is by


68
0:8:55,3 --> 0:9:0,75
far one of the most gratifying and memorable
experiences I've ever had. I learned more


69
0:9:0,75 --> 0:9:4,75
than I
can yet describe, met so many amazing people,


70
0:9:4,75 --> 0:9:7,92
and had the best time imaginable. And I did
it all


71
0:9:7,92 --> 0:11:7,92
in temperatures that averaged 20 degrees below
zero.
