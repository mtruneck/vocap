GELAREH KIAZAND: Dardar had
been able to get us into a


3
0:0:11,23 --> 0:0:11,91
quail fight.


4
0:0:11,91 --> 0:0:14,62
But now we needed to find our
way to the Ka Faroshi Bird


5
0:0:14,62 --> 0:0:18,28
Market, home to all of Kabul's
rival bird trainers.


6
0:0:18,28 --> 0:0:21,67
Today was the first day of Eid
[ARABIC], Eid al-Adha, the


7
0:0:21,67 --> 0:0:23,13
celebration of sacrifice.


8
0:0:23,13 --> 0:0:25,925
And Dardar invited us to join
in on the festivities.

12
0:0:49,97 --> 0:0:51,815
GELAREH KIAZAND: So everyone
basically comes together


13
0:0:51,815 --> 0:0:53,4
before Eid [ARABIC]


14
0:0:53,4 --> 0:0:57,8
And they all do the prayer
before the sacrifice.


15
0:0:57,8 --> 0:1:1,232
So this is one of the main
community mosques, where,


16
0:1:1,232 --> 0:1:3,4
apparently, thousands
of people come.


17
0:1:3,4 --> 0:1:4,629
And they pray.


18
0:1:4,629 --> 0:1:6,91
It's pretty high
security today.


19
0:1:6,91 --> 0:1:9,158
Everyone's worried about
the bomb in the turban.

0:1:50,71 --> 0:1:51,92
GELAREH KIAZAND: They
asked me to leave.


26
0:1:51,92 --> 0:1:54,54
They say it's not good for a
woman to be inside the mosque.


27
0:1:54,54 --> 0:1:57,0
So I didn't want to
cause any trouble.


28
0:1:57,0 --> 0:2:0,6
So I decided to leave.


29
0:2:0,6 --> 0:2:5,726
Now everyone's going to their
homes to do the sacrifice.


30
0:2:5,726 --> 0:2:9,94
I think they're going to
sacrifice that cow right now.

disgusting.


34
0:2:27,153 --> 0:2:32,35



35
0:2:32,35 --> 0:2:36,96
So what happens is that when a
cow is sacrificed, or a sheep,


36
0:2:36,96 --> 0:2:39,6
they take a little bit
for themselves.


37
0:2:39,6 --> 0:2:42,2
And then they basically
cut up the meat.


38
0:2:42,2 --> 0:2:45,97
And they pass it to the poor or
the rest of the community.


39
0:2:45,97 --> 0:2:47,45
So we're at someone's house.


40
0:2:47,45 --> 0:2:48,532
It smells so good here.


41
0:2:48,532 --> 0:2:51,25
It smells like mother's
cooking.

GELAREH KIAZAND: With
festivities for Eid finished,


45
0:3:55,84 --> 0:3:57,68
animal fights were back on.

47
0:4:9,37 --> 0:4:11,853
GELAREH KIAZAND: We're on our
way to a street called Ka


48
0:4:11,853 --> 0:4:15,89
Faroshi, which is where they
sell the different types of


49
0:4:15,89 --> 0:4:17,49
birds that they bring
out into the fights.


50
0:4:17,49 --> 0:4:21,532
For example, partridges,
roosters, canaries, pigeons,


51
0:4:21,532 --> 0:4:22,782
and quails.


52
0:4:22,782 --> 0:4:33,11



53
0:4:33,11 --> 0:4:35,9
The shopkeepers train and fight
their animals as a team,


54
0:4:35,9 --> 0:4:37,69
because the buying and
upkeep of birds is


55
0:4:37,69 --> 0:4:39,445
actually pretty expensive.


56
0:4:39,445 --> 0:4:42,6
If you walk around the market
for long enough, you start to


57
0:4:42,6 --> 0:4:44,114
recognize some of
the rival teams.

GELAREH KIAZAND: He's got 48
kids and 12 grandchildren.


60
0:5:14,4 --> 0:5:17,22
And then they basically are
working across the street,


61
0:5:17,22 --> 0:5:20,85
different shops, so he can
pay off his debts.


62
0:5:20,85 --> 0:5:24,19
So these are where
all his sons are.


63
0:5:24,19 --> 0:5:26,21
He owns all of these birds.


64
0:5:26,21 --> 0:5:29,73
And they're going to try to put
together a fight for us.

morning, after prayers, all


68
0:5:58,31 --> 0:6:0,42
the rival teams showed up for
the match with their best

partridge fights is for one

0:6:27,77 --> 0:6:29,26
bird to tie the other bird up.


75
0:6:29,26 --> 0:6:32,566
Apparently, they're really
strong partridges.


76
0:6:32,566 --> 0:6:37,14
And they keep French kissing the
birds to keep them cool.


77
0:6:37,14 --> 0:6:39,7
The owners hold water in their
mouths and spit it onto their


78
0:6:39,7 --> 0:6:41,41
birds to make sure they
don't overheat.

The bets have been raised.

Apparently it's at
100,000 now.

0:7:25,695 --> 0:7:27,595
It started at 30,000.


87

So see what animal is going
to win, I guess.


88
0:7:31,88 --> 0:7:34,96
After two hours of fighting, one
partridge finally stumbles

out of the circle,
ending the match.
