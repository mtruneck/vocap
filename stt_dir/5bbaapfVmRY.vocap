###3 JULIAN NELUMS, HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR: And I`m Julian.
###4 OKEKE: We go to South (inaudible) High School.
###5 NELUMS: And you`re watching CNN STUDENT NEWS.

###17 AZUZ: Usually on CNN STUDENT NEWS we say how Fridays are awesome. For a lot of the U.S.,
###25 this Friday is frozen. You expect snow and cold temperatures in the winter. What makes
###30 this storm different, is that it`s huge. Around 60 million people -- we`re talking 20 percent
###36 of the entire U.S. population potentially effected by this. Governors and mayors have
###41 declared states of emergency. The area that`s being hit is roughly the same size as Mexico,
###46 and the storm`s bringing some unusual weather. You probably haven`t seen or heard that too
###54 often, it`s called thunder snow. And you need the right ingredients for it to happen. Cold
###59 air on top of warm air with moist air close to the ground. This massive winter storm is
###64 causing trouble problems like what CNN`s Ted Rowlands ran into outside Kansas City.
###69 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
###69 TED ROWLANDS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The freeways here are a mess. An absolute mess. I was stuck
###74 on I-29 for about an hour and a half just dead still, I`ve gone on 35, I-70, all of
###80 it mess. And though biggest part is not only visibility, but the snow accumulation is just
###85 -- it`s piling up, and people are getting stuck, spinning out, there`s trucks all over
###90 the road, there are (inaudible) a couple of medical emergencies, which, of course, have
###94 made it very difficult that the snow makes it very difficult for first responders to
###99 get to those people and (inaudible) is they warn people do not drive in this conditions.
###104 There`s a reason why. This storm is a whopper.
###107 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###107 AZUZ: There might be a silver lining here. Some of the states getting hit have been dealing
###111 with the terrible drought. So when all this snow melts, the water could help relieve some
###116 of those drought issues.

###119 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: See if you can I.D. me. I`m a country that borders 14 others. I`m
###127 the fourth largest nation in land area. I have the world`s second largest economy, and
###133 when it comes to population, I`m number one. I`m China. And my most populated city is Shanghai.
###143 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###146 AZUZ: An American online security companies say Shanghai is home to a group of the world`s
###152 most effective computer hackers. U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano says Chin
###158 is one of the biggest sources for cyber attacks against the United States. When you picture
###163 a hacker, you might think of one person, like a lone wolf type, hammering away at a keyboard
###167 in the dark room somewhere. The American firm says this group of hackers in Shanghai is
###172 connected to the Chinese government.
###174 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
###174 DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It`s clear that this installation of buildings is closely
###178 watched by the People`s Liberation Army, and allegation is that they`re working in conjunction
###183 with civilian hackers. As we got closer to take a look, we got in trouble.
###190 Keep driving. Drive away. Drive away. Drive away.
###192 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###193 AZUZ: World of espionage is moved online. It`s where cyber spies can get access to all
###198 kinds of sensitive information. Hackers might be able to access electricity grid or telecommunications
###204 networks. This Shanghai group is accused of stealing technology blueprints and sensitive
###209 business plans. Chinese officials deny any connection to hacking. They say they`re the
###214 victim of cyber attacks, mostly from the U.S.

###218 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Today`s "Shoutout" goes out to Mrs. Bosco`s American history classes
###223 at St. Barnabas Episcopal School in DeLand, Florida.
###228 What amendment to the U.S. Constitution discusses the right to bear arms? Here we go now. Is
###233 it the 1st Amendment, 2nd Amendment, 5th Amendment or 10th Amendment?
###237 You`ve got three seconds, go!
###245 Those words show up in the 2nd Amendment. That`s your answer and that`s your "Shoutout."
###251 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###252 AZUZ: You often hear the 2nd Amendment mentioned alongside the issue of guns in America. Yesterday,
###258 a little more than two months after a school in Connecticut, Vice President Joe Biden traveled
###262 there to promote stricter gun control, new restrictions on who can buy guns and what
###268 guns can be bought. People who support gun rights including the National Rifle Association
###273 say new restrictions aren`t going to help stop gun violence, and may violate the 2nd
###278 Amendment. So, why exactly is there so much debate over this?
###281 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
###281 JEFFREY TOOBIN, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST: The 2nd Amendment may be the single most mysterious
###285 part of the Constitution. It`s an ungrammatical sentence, it refers to militias, which don`t
###292 even exist anymore. And it`s been the subject of an intense, intense controversy.
###298 The 2nd Amendment has two parts, the first part talks about state militias. It says that
###306 state militias are a necessary part of national defense. And the second part refers to the
###314 right to keep and bear arms.
###317 The question of how the two relate is something people are still debating.
###323 Militias were effectively how the United States raised armies in the early days of the Republic.
###333 There were essentially more or less volunteer forces of young men who fought for their states
###343 and fought for the country in what we call militias.
###350 Starting about 20 years ago, a lot of conservatives, especially in the National Rifle Association
###356 started to say, look, the 2nd Amendment has been misinterpreted by the courts. It is not
###362 just about state militias, it`s about individuals rights to keep and bear arms. And the National
###368 Rifle Association, academics associated with it, other academics started writing and arguing
###376 for an individual right to keep and bear arms.
###384 This question about what the 2nd Amendment means, has one final arbiter. And that`s the
###391 Supreme Court of the United States. In 2008, the Supreme Court said there was an individual
###398 right to keep and bear a handgun in your home. Justice Scalia`s opinion in the 2008 Heller
###407 case said also the government can regulate dangerous and unusual weapons. But what`s
###414 a dangerous and unusual weapon? We don`t really know. Is it an assault weapon? May be. Is
###422 it tank? I think it`s safe to say yes. I don`t think the Supreme Court is going back at this
###427 point. The court isn`t going to make it 180 degree turn on the 2nd Amendment, but they
###432 could certainly confine the right to keep and bear arms.

###438 AZUZ: Well, ready or not, prom season`s around the corner. Onyeka and Julian who introduced
###445 today`s show are ready. He recently asked her to dance flash-mob style. Julian and 19
###450 classmates choreographed a routine to a One Direction song "One Thing." They did it in
###455 only four rehearsals. We talked to the best friends about that moment, but first, we want
###459 you to check out how the group pulled off the surprise in the Youtube video that has
###463 thousands of views.
###465 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
###470 (MUSIC)
###472 OKEKE: I should have known, like all the (inaudible) around me -- but I had no idea. I was totally
###490 surprised.
###490 NELUMS: Every time I watched it, I`m still kind of like in awe that it all went down.
###495 And I kind of like my stomach and like jumps -- oh, my gosh, we did this, and it went perfectly.
###498 OKEKE: I was like why are they dancing, and why are they pointing at me and then I started
###504 seeing more and more of my friends coming up, and I was like oh, where is Julian? And
###508 that is when I kind of got the clue.
###510 NELUMS: I was just listening to everything happening, I was like oh my gosh, (inaudible)
###513 soon, so my heart was just pounding and pounding. I was like I get to get this right.
###516 OKEKE: Well, yeah, actually -- I think we got up in the moment that he didn`t ask me
###521 right there. Like later on, he had to (inaudible) oh, yes, I forgot to ask you, we go and I
###523 already said yes in my mind, so. It was yes.
###527 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###528 AZUZ: Thumbs up is right. Now, I wasn`t that creative, but maybe you were, you heard about
###533 somebody`s fancy prom date request. Tell us the coolest way to ask someone to prom, those
###538 of you on Facebook can go to Facebook.com/snnstudentnews to do it. Teachers, we are not leaving you
###543 out. We want to hear from you, too. Tell us what you think about today`s show. Log on
###546 to snnstudentnews.com to do that.
###549 Our last segment today is about a one trick pony, but it`s a really good trick. Mariska
###554 the Mare is a master lock picker, she doesn`t just let herself out of the barn, she opens
###559 the doors for all the other horses, too. Except her mom. Probably, payback for all those lectures
###565 about leaving the barn door open. Mariska opens doors, she opens gates, she opens coolers.
###571 Her owner finally latched on the idea to show off the skills on Youtube. Did the video go
###576 viral? Oh, that was just a lock! We just hope Mariska doesn`t forget how to do this escape
###581 act, because that`d be a shame to see her stall out. And Mariska, you need to be nice
###584 to your mother, you two should really try for a stable relationship. Have a great weekend,
###588 everyone.
