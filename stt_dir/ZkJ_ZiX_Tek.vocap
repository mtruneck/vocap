###17 ALEX JONES: Politicians are there to lie and deceive and
###20 to continually trick the people into never getting
###23 control of their society again.
###25 They are there to keep the elites in power.
###27 They are there for the upper class to wage war against the
###30 middle class and the working class.
###31 It's the two parties teamed up against the people, two wings
###35 on the same bird of prey.
###37 Instead of looking at the wings all day, let's talk
###38 about the head, the beak, the guts of this thing, its mind,
###41 its eyes, what it believes, what this bird does.
###45 This is tyranny.
###46 This is what globalism is.
###47 We want a new world order?
###49 It's the banks that engineered the collapse and they're
###51 bragging about it.
###52 Folks, what we know is off the chart crazy.
###55 Imagine what we don't know because truth is strange,
###60 ladies and gentlemen.
###61 
###64 RYAN DUFFY: So we started shooting this piece in the
###65 spring of 2009.
###67 President Obama had just been elected and was enjoying
###69 really high approval ratings.
###71 And most people were still holding out hope that we could
###73 get through the economic crisis and things would be
###75 back to normal soon.
###76 But as we traveled across the country, we began the kind of
###79 sense that there was something else
###80 stirring under the surface.
###82 There was this growing movement of people who really
###83 feared the government and rejected this idea of hope all
###86 together.
###87 -Be out here and show people that we--
###88 I've never protested anything in my life.
###91 This is the first time.
###92 RYAN DUFFY: Oh, really.
###92 This is the first time.
###93 -This is the first time.
###93 RYAN DUFFY: Wow.
###94 -But I see a need for it and I'm going to be here until the
###97 last petal falls.
###99 RYAN DUFFY: More and more folks were starting to listen
###101 to people like Alex Jones.
###102 -[INAUDIBLE]
###103 ALEX JONES: Come on, people.
###105 The elite are going for broke.
###106 The level of crimes and looting and corruption they
###109 have engaged means they were going all the way to the--
###113 RYAN DUFFY: They believed we were standing on the edge of a
###114 total collapse and they were getting ready to fight in the
###117 second American Revolution.
###119 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###132 CHRIS HEDGES: It's the end of an era.
###135 We live in a state of collective self delusion.
###137 
###144 My name is Chris Hedges.
###146 I graduated from seminary at Harvard Divinity School, did
###150 not get ordained.
###151 I spent almost 20 years of my life as a foreign
###154 correspondent, eventually, 15 of them with
###156 the New York Times.
###158 I came back to United States, ran afoul of my employer over
###162 the issue of the Iraq War.
###164 I was told not to speak out against the war or I would
###167 lose my job.
###168 And faced with that choice, I left the paper.
###171 I write books.
###173 And when I'm not doing that, I'm a soccer dad.
###175 
###178 Conspiracy theories become a way to explain the chaos of a
###184 world people don't understand.
###185 What conspiracy theorists don't grasp is that the elite
###189 is also inept.
###190 And conspiracy theorists frighten me because they can't
###194 read reality any more than people who naively believe
###200 that a corrupt elite is going to bring back the salad days
###206 of casino capitalism can read reality.
###208 And the worse it gets, the less people can confront it
###212 because it's painful.
###214 SGT. CHARLES DYER: American patriots, you may or may not
###218 agree with what I'm about to say.
###220 This is not the time for reservation or political
###222 correctness.
###223 What lies before us is of grave concern to freedom.
###228 Because of what your chance to lose by remaining silent,
###232 silence shouldn't even be an option.
###234 My name is Sergeant Charles Dyer.
###236 I'm a United States Marine, an Oath Keeper, and a
###240 constitutional patriot.
###242 I entered the Marine Corps in 1998 at the tender age of 17.
###247 Back then I was piss and vinegar and ready
###250 for a fight, I guess.
###252 I didn't care about politics.
###253 I was all about following orders and doing what I was
###255 told and fighting for freedom across the globe, I suppose,
###260 as any young marine would.
###263 I'm actually very new to the resistance movement.
###266 I've probably only been awake with the situation for maybe
###269 the last year or so.
###272 It's the targets.
###274 The patriot movement is basically consisting of all
###278 kinds of different organizations all across the
###280 United States.
###280 You're looking at militias or maybe the American resistance
###285 movement, the umbrella organization.
###287 You may have the Ohio militia, or Michigan militia or,
###290 whatever militias all over the place.
###291 Citizens militias like in San Diego, they're all under the
###295 patriot movement.
###297 And we're trying to take back this Republic and restore this
###300 Republic like it's supposed to be, what it was intended from
###302 our founders.
###304 
###306 We're here to meet gsbamerica from YouTube.
###310 His name's--
###312 well, I guess I probably shouldn't say his name, huh?
###314 gsbamerica from YouTube.
###316 
###320 JALIRA: Hello.
###321 SGT. CHARLES DYER: How are you doing today?
###321 JALIRA: Good, how are you?
###323 I'm Heather.
###323 This is the first time we've ever met, I
###325 mean, besides YouTube.
###326 We've talked on the phone and we've emailed plenty.
###328 But everybody gets real excited about YouTube stars.
###333 I'm Jalira on YouTube.
###336 SGT. CHARLES DYER: That's our biggest
###336 weapon now, the internet.
###337 That's getting the word out so fast.
###340 I think that's where I probably woke up at, watch
###343 stuff on the net.
###344 GSBAMERICA: And if even a quarter of the stuff we read
###347 is true, then we've got problems.
###350 SGT. CHARLES DYER: Just the stuff that you can prove is--
###352 we know we have problems with the globalization, them saying
###354 they want a new world order.
###355 They want a global government.
###358 They want everything to be under one law, you know.
###360 When you start delving into some of this stuff-- and it's
###363 not hard to get on a path of just--
###367 it makes you crazy, learning all the crap that happens in
###370 this country.
###372 -I don't understand what's going on.
###375 We've got to wake the people up to realize that our country
###378 is just going down the tubes and our
###380 government is doing it.
###383 I see if something is not done very quickly to stop Obama and
###388 Pelosi and everything else going on, I can guarantee you,
###393 we're going to be in a civil war in a very short time.
###396 But I will fight.
###397 
###401 Deport Illegals.
###404 End the deficit in California.
###407 -No bail out for Mexico.
###410 -So anyway, I have a guest here.
###412 He wanted to talk to you guys just about the Oath Keepers.
###417 And I don't know if everybody knows who the Oath Keeprs.
###419 -Yes.
###420 -Yeah, they're awesome.
###422 They give me a lot of hope.
###423 
###426 SGT. CHARLES DYER: All right, I see a lot of older faces
###428 around here.
###428 How many of you guys are military?
###432 Military?
###434 I All right, Oath Keepers, that's the organization that
###436 I'm apart of and we try to touch out to active and former
###441 military and law enforcement, anybody's who taken an oath to
###444 defend the Constitution, try to make them realize that the
###447 oath they took doesn't expire.
###449 So for you older gentleman, too, you may
###451 think I'm too old.
###452 There's nothing I can do, right?
###456 That's wrong.
###457 This is bigger than the immigration problem.
###460 Right now, the United States government and governments all
###464 over the world are trying to bring in globalization.
###468 I don't know if any of you have ever heard the term new
###470 world order.
###472 They're trying to bring in a new world order and destroy
###474 our sovereignty.
###476 That is a direct attack on the Constitution
###479 of this United States.
###481 That means that they are the domestic enemy that I swore to
###486 defend and fight against to defend my Constitution.
###490 And I'm willing to put my life on the line
###493 to defend this country.
###494 And I'm asking that anybody who's taken the
###497 oath to do the same.
###498 And it doesn't matter your age.
###500 So that's all that I really want to talk to
###502 you guys about today.
###503 And I thank you all for coming out here.
###506 ALEX JONES: This is very exciting.
###508 Oath Keeprs just started a few months ago, Stewart Rhodes,
###511 former Airborne Ranger in the army, worked for the Ron Paul
###513 campaign at the highest levels, got upset about what
###515 was happening with the new world order after the campaign
###517 ended, knew that things were intensifying.
###519 And he understood that tyranny will come to
###522 your door in a uniform.
###524 -Welcome to Lexington, the cradle of American liberty.
###528 
###532 ALEX JONES: So perfect timing with the first big Oath
###535 Keepers meeting coming up on the green in Lexington where
###538 it all started in 1775, April 19th.
###542 SGT. CHARLES DYER: We went to Lexington Green.
###543 What we were there to do was just to let people know about
###547 Oath Keeprs and what Oath Keepers were and what it was
###551 to keep an oath and not just take an oath because there's a
###556 big difference between them.
###556 -[INAUDIBLE]
###558 -Pledging my life--
###559 -Pledging my life--
###561 -My fortune--
###562 -My fortune--
###563 -And my sacred--
###564 -It's where the first shots of the revolution were fired.
###566 The first revolution, not the new, second, upcoming
###569 revolution.
###570 LTD CMDR GUY CUNNINGHAM: --studies that when I took the
###572 oath of office to uphold and defend the constitution of the
###575 United States of America against all enemies, foreign
###578 and domestic, I knew in my heart what I meant when I
###583 raised my hand and swore to it.
###586 -Yeah.
###586 [APPLAUSE]
###593 STEWART RHODES: You see the need to
###594 stand up and say, look--
###595 I get letters all the time from people that are terrified
###598 and concerned and worried that the military's going to be
###601 used against them.
###601 And I saw that during Bush.
###603 There were Democrats that were upset about that and rightly
###605 so, looking at the rhetoric of the Bush administration.
###608 Now, you got Obama in there.
###609 And now you've got people on the conservative side
###611 who are waking up.
###612 And the reason why they're so afraid is because they all
###614 understand that power was grown so much and the
###617 constraints on government has been eroded so much that they
###620 are all vulnerable.
###621 When one guy's in charge, then the other guys are terrified.
###624 When their guy's in charge, then their terrified.
###627 ALEX JONES: With every successive month that follows,
###630 more and more people wake up to the two puppet system.
###632 There's a puppet on the left, a puppet on the right.
###635 Wait, it's one guy holding both puppets.
###637 I don't like that guy.
###639 CHRIS HEDGES: There's no dispute among the supposed
###642 spectrum between the left and the right, between Democratic
###644 and Republican over the core ideology that
###649 is raping the country.
###652 So corporatism is about as close to unmitigated evil as
###659 you can get because it has built into it a kind of logic
###666 of increasing profits without any regard for the human cost.
###671 We've destroyed our country.
###673 We've decimated our working class.
###675 We are in the process of decimating our middle class.
###677 We've created an American oligarchy.
###680 We are allowing corporate powers to destroy the
###683 ecosystem that sustains the human species.
###685 Nobody is stepping up, least of all Barack
###688 Obama, to stop it.
###690 And we are diverted by bread and circus.
###695 If you doubt it, just watch what passes for news.
###698 STEVE DOOCY: Hello, everybody.
###699 I'm Steve Doocy with your FOX Flash.
###701 The octomom and her mother, the octo grandma, face off in
###706 a heated online interview.
###707 -You already have six beautiful children.
###708 -You need to learn to let go.
###709 -Why would you do this?
###710 -But you need to learn to let go.
###711 -So I will never understand.
###715 BARACK OBAMA: He's sleeping inside the White House.
###715 -Is he going to be in a bed?
###717 BARACK OBAMA: Not in my bed.
###719 -Recently, we've made some life changing decisions.
###723 CHRIS HEDGES: Given the gravity of the situation
###725 around us, it would almost be amusing if
###729 it wasn't so dangerous.
###733 That's how empires die.
###735 And we're dying.
###736 We're dying.
###737 
###739 SGT. CHARLES DYER: Let me ask you a question.
###741 Would you follow the Constitution against any
###743 orders, even if the President gives an order?
###746 You would stay with the constitution and defend it?
###747 -Yes.
###748 SGT. CHARLES DYER: Then he is an Oath Keeper.
###749 There you go.
###750 It's that simple.
###753 All right, now we're at Escondido, California at Mr.
###755 Paint Ball.
###757 And we come out here to play air soft and do a little
###758 training and stuff.
###760 I normally meet some militia members from San Diego.
###763 Some of my guys help train their guys since all my guys
###766 are marines and they're all civilians.
###769 We need a citizen militia.
###771 We need a citizen militia to defend us from
###774 the government, basically.
###776 That's the only reason we have the Second Amendment is to
###778 defend the American people and our country from a tyrannical
###781 government, which is what we're heading
###783 toward right now.
###784 Watch that left flank, now.
###787 We are definitely the guardians of the Republic and
###790 the last stand if something comes down because the
###794 military, they fall under the UCMJ and a lot of people will
###801 follow any order just for fear of being thrown to prison and
###805 put in the brig.
###806 There's a lot of us that will defy orders as long as it's
###810 for the Constitution and defense of the Constitution.
###813 We know what this is all about.
###815 We know why we're here.
###816 And we're very strong in our beliefs and our convictions.
###819 
###822 They need to realize that the reasons we're in Iraq and
###825 Afghanistan right now are not as good as
###826 people think they are.
###828 Right now we're doing nothing other than feeding the
###830 industrial military complex and creating debt for the
###832 Federal Reserve, which isn't even a federal organization,
###835 so that they can enslave us and control us.
###838 So join the military?
###840 Depends on what you want to do with it.
###842 Me, I'm going to use my training from the military
###844 and, I suppose, become one of those domestic terrorists that
###850 we're so afraid of from the DHS and their reports.
###854 Ridiculous.
###856 -Remember, I got detained and searched
###859 while I was in uniform.
###860 SGT. CHARLES DYER: Really?
###862 -Last day service uniform, two ribbons on my breast, my
###866 freaking [INAUDIBLE] badge and all.
###869 I got detained, Dallas, Fort Worth, on my lay over.
###872 Searched my bag.
###873 Searched my gear.
###874 Searched everything.
###875 SGT. CHARLES DYER: We are definitely
###876 targets now, military.
###877 We are targets.
###879 And that is sad.
###880 That's sad.
###881 I've been to Iraq.
###883 I've been deployed.
###886 I've got nothing but the strongest
###888 feelings for my country.
###889 
###898 Having marines die over there and then we come home and
###907 those bastards want to talk about how we're domestic
###910 terrorists and a threat to this country.
###913 It makes me so angry.
###914 
###919 It just saddens me to think that we come back and we're
###922 treated like that by our government.
###924 You know, I got one of my marines right here being
###926 detained for hours because he's in uniform trying to get
###929 through the metal detectors in an airport?
###932 It's ridiculous.
###934 Ridiculous.
###935 Things have to change.
###936 It can't go on like this.
###938 Something has to be done.
###939 
###944 ALEX JONES: I've got this breaking news.
###946 National security watch, 60 right wing terror plots foiled
###951 in the ten years since the '95 Oklahoma City bombing killed
###955 168 people.
###956 By the way, that was a federal bombing.
###957 We've proven that.
###958 Roughly 60 right wing terrorist plots have been
###961 uncovered in the United States according to an upcoming
###963 report of the Southern Poverty Law Center's
###964 intelligence project.
###966 The media's saying the Tea Parties are evil terrorists
###969 who are basically cop killers is what they're trying to say.
###972 And they're a bunch of right wingers when it isn't about
###973 left and right.
###974 They're desperate to divide the American people.
###977 
###980 CINDY MALLETTE: Barack Obama's Department of Homeland
###981 Security, you may have heard, is trying to classify us as
###986 right wing extremists, trying to warn people to be aware of
###989 people like us.
###990 -Boo.
###992 CINDY MALLETTE: Yeah, boo.
###994 The real people we need to be fearing are our so called
###997 elected officials in
###998 Washington D.C. -Amen.
###1002 CINDY MALLETTE: That's right.
###1003 -I do not believe in political correctness.
###1006 And if somebody--
###1007 I don't care if he wears a badge or a gun or what.
###1009 If he does something wrong, I'm going to be right in his
###1011 face telling him.
###1012 And, well, I guess I'm a
###1013 terrorist because I'm pro-life.
###1016 -Say one word and they mow you down.
###1017 -Yeah, you know--
###1019 -They'll mow you down.
###1019 -Die for God.
###1021 Die for the right reasons and it's OK.
###1025 -Somebody just came up to the stage and said we have
###1028 pictures of them taking pictures of us.
###1032 Just call me paranoid, but that just doesn't look like
###1035 the local news network.
###1037 
###1039 Let them know you're not a threat, you have a valid
###1043 driver's license on you, and your passport is safely at
###1046 home, and you love America.
###1049 Isn't that perfect?
###1049 There's a bald eagle and there's Homeland Security.
###1052 
###1054 Everybody just wave at them real big so they get a good
###1057 picture of us.
###1058 
###1060 ALEX JONES: It says the number one threat is returning
###1063 troops, gun owners, people buying all
###1065 these guns and ammo.
###1066 This is the number one terror threat.
###1068 That is a quote.
###1069 And they have really upset people.
###1073 CHRIS HEDGES: Alienation and anger is one that is very
###1078 common among returning veterans.
###1080 You saw it after the Vietnam War.
###1084 You're seeing it with these guys, men and women that are
###1087 coming back.
###1088 And when you couple that with a societal breakdown that
###1093 essentially denies them the possibility of reintegrating
###1097 into the society, then you are very volatile and toxic mix.
###1102 
###1106 SGT. CHARLES DYER: It's like Vietnam.
###1108 It's not a winnable war.
###1109 It's just sustainable.
###1110 The longer we stay over there, the more debt
###1112 they can put on us.
###1115 Look at-- what did the President say?
###1117 We were going to be out of there as soon as he got in
###1118 office pretty much?
###1119 How long has he been president now?
###1121 And we're still in Iraq.
###1123 I saw some stuff over there that kind of changed my mind.
###1126 We lost a good marine.
###1129 I sat there and I kept staring at the bodies
###1132 that were laying around.
###1133 And it kind of hit me that these guys are nothing but me.
###1136 They're not terrorists.
###1138 They're guys that are defending their country.
###1140 They're not terrorists.
###1141 The guys in Afghanistan, they're not terrorists.
###1144 They're defending their country
###1145 from a foreign invasion.
###1146 We create terrorists.
###1148 You come into my house and you kill my wife, you kill my
###1151 daughter, you kill any part of my family, and I'm probably
###1154 going to strap on a suicide vest, go to one of your
###1156 checkpoints.
###1157 So that's what we're creating over there in my mind.
###1161 That's all I have to say about that situation for the moment.
###1165 CHRIS HEDGES: When you go into combat, you come back, you not
###1168 only suffer from trauma, but if you become self aware, you
###1172 suffer a tremendous existential crisis.
###1175 You realize that all the things you were taught by both
###1178 religious and secular institutions are a lie.
###1182 And it's very, very hard to adjust because when you come
###1185 back that truth, the kind of prophetic truth, is very
###1193 difficult for people who have not been to war to hear.
###1197 You are really a stranger in a strange land.
###1202 SGT. CHARLES DYER: Patriots, we are not overpowered.
###1205 If we unite under one banner of freedom and fight for our
###1208 children's liberty and the defense of the Constitution,
###1212 our resolve is invincible to any standing army.
###1216 They might be able to take the very breath from our lungs,
###1219 but they can never rip the freedoms from our souls.
###1224 CHRIS HEDGES: Rhetoric and language is not benign.
###1227 You have to get people to talk in the language of violence
###1230 before they commit violence.
###1232 -Good evening, ladies and gentleman, [INAUDIBLE]
###1234 town watchmen.
###1237 I got one question to begin this video.
###1240 I mean, you got to ask yourself, tonight, are you
###1245 felling lucky new world order?
###1247 -It's all part of a plan that's been in the works for
###1250 many years, the new world order.
###1252 And I just want to be a part of this.
###1256 I'm really more of a follower.
###1258 -I think that more women, especially young women, need
###1261 to get more involved in this, probably going out and
###1264 learning how to work the Mosberg Model 88 pump action
###1268 12 gauge shot gun to protect yourself.
###1270 And we need to fight alongside our men and our friends and
###1273 our families for our freedom and the Constitution.
###1277 -We don't play games.
###1278 We quit school because it had a recess.
###1281 You put us out of work and you stole our pensions.
###1284 So we found us a new job.
###1286 It's called chewing chewing gum and kicking butt.
###1288 And guess what?
###1289 I'm about on my last piece of chewing gum.
###1292 And I know you've done strategic stuff.
###1295 And I've got the documents right here in front of me.
###1297 Let me move this 50 caliber right here, and I'll shell up
###1300 your nose and blow you away if you mess with American
###1302 patriot.
###1302 -Now, listen, I love my country.
###1305 And that's why I have to discourage people from joining
###1307 the military with this guy in the White House.
###1309 If you want to protect your country, join
###1312 them or start a militia.
###1314 But you don't want Obama to be your commander in chief.
###1317 
###1320 CHRIS HEDGES: So you have these forces unleashed and
###1323 amplified by a mass media in a society that stands on the
###1328 cusp of disintegration.
###1330 And remember that within American society there's a
###1332 deep undercurrent of violence.
###1335 SGT. CHARLES DYER: Back in the 90's there was a militia
###1335 movement where a lot of people got together doing the same
###1337 thing that we're doing now, training.
###1340 A lot of it was more weekend warriors, really, though
###1343 because as soon as Timothy McVeigh and those ass clowns
###1347 went and blew up buildings and killed innocent children.
###1350 And the government tries to blame the militia
###1353 movement for that.
###1354 No matter what, in any movement, any group, there's
###1357 always going to be crazies.
###1357 There's always going to be the people that are extreme one
###1360 way or the other and they think that killing people,
###1362 just killing people period is going to make a difference.
###1365 And it's not.
###1366 It's absolutely not.
###1368 ALEX JONES: For those that don't understand this, we are
###1370 at a historic crossroads.
###1372 And I can see in their eyes and their actions, I realize
###1375 they're actually intimidated.
###1376 They realize that they've put their
###1378 criminal action into motion.
###1380 It's a machine they can't turn off.
###1382 And I think they're starting to brace for the fact--
###1385 I mean, it's like when you get into fights.
###1386 Some bully punches you and then you gear up and start
###1389 punching back.
###1389 And you can tell you're going to whip their ass.
###1391 I mean, that's the feeling right here.
###1393 We are going to lick the new world order's butt.
###1395 
###1398 SGT. CHARLES DYER: There's no way we're going to be able to
###1399 get [INAUDIBLE]
###1401 unless we go way back here.
###1404 There's some people that think something's going to happen
###1406 within the next two months.
###1408 There's some people that think something's going to
###1409 happen in two years.
###1410 There's some people that think nothing will ever happen.
###1412 So, I guess, time is the only thing that can answer that.
###1416 CHRIS HEDGES: We are headed to civil unrest.
###1418 We have dis-empowered our working class and there are
###1421 whole pockets now in the United States that resemble
###1423 the third world, where the end of the world is no longer an
###1426 abstraction.
###1427 Violence is a kind of cleansing agent because the
###1430 world around them is one that has betrayed them
###1433 and that they hate.
###1434 And that is the lure of apocalyptic violence.
###1438 It eradicates what almost destroyed me.
###1441 SGT. CHARLES DYER: I just want to ask the American people to
###1442 wake up and see what's going on around you.
###1445 Walk outside and stop playing your video games.
###1447 Stop watching your TV.
###1448 CHRIS HEDGES: In a corporate state the interests and needs
###1452 of citizens don't matter.
###1454 You need to destroy the machine because if we don't
###1458 destroy the machine, the machine's going to destroy us.
###1461 It is destroying us.
###1463 SGT. CHARLES DYER: Vote and become politically involved or
###1466 start a militia, which is very important.
###1469 Do something.
###1470 Do something to make yourselves better and more
###1472 prepared for what may be coming.
###1475 CHRIS HEDGES: Violence isn't going to work.
###1477 Violence is a mistake.
###1479 Machine wants violence, it justifies further oppression.
###1483 SGT. CHARLES DYER: I'm not going to be hiding from my
###1484 command anymore.
###1485 And I'm sure not hiding from ATF.
###1486 I'm not hiding from FBI.
###1488 I'm not hiding from any organization.
###1490 If they want to come take me, I'm not going to be afraid.
###1492 If I'm afraid to that point, we're in a tyrannical
###1495 government in the first place and people need to rise up.
###1498 At that point, there needs to be a violent revolution.
