###18 consequences of that uh... is one woman by the name that i had this year at
###22 warez uh... in maricopa county
###25 now this account to assure show right so these are guys who do heinous of all
###28 time

###230 she has a fourteen year old daughter that she couldn't take care of fraph
###233 four and a half months because she was
###235 uh... thrown in jail for something that she didn't do right
###238 and also i want to go back to something you said jake about arizona voters and
###242 how they probably thought aryan out there by the criminals then he average
###246 and put them away without bail them out
###247 this is a very specific piece of uh... this is a very specific proposition
###252 right where they said undocumented immigrants do not get to post bail and
###256 i'm one hundred percent disagree with what you said this was something that
###260 was targeted against undocumented immigrants arizona has a history of
###264 discriminating against hispanics and this is another piece of the i can say
###269 what is it considered legislation if it's proposition it's another
###271 proposition that's eight
###273 at you know destroying families in arizona if they're brown and i'm real
###278 and tired of it and i'm tired of making excuses for people in arizona attack
###282 making excuses for conservatives in the country people who want to discriminate
###285 against people of color
###286 that's what's happening in this state
###288 well done and uh... so it is true that i'm at a summit on top of it
###291 which is that
###293 with dressing crazy is that okay you want are you done document people right
###297 ok anyway might disagree with them when i think that there's a better way to
###302 address that issue which is a real issue itself right
###306 if u judge people guilty
###308 before there's even a trial you don't even know what they're under outstanding
###313 she was perfectly documented
###315 and you think that white people get live in the guide name robert johnson gets
###319 locked up for being on diamond look even blood people even black i get slide them
###323 in arizona
###324 uh... because uh... they thought he was on document now the my liable for other
###328 reasons that i a lot of over there is an
###331 obviously this specifically allows
###334 corrupt law enforcement to go after but he does in america
###338 and the guy who ascended uh... the the top of the detective locker but the
###343 first place
###344 he lied on the stand and said oh yeah i have information
###347 that does she herd ever do
###349 though driving it is a forgery the prosecution literally had one at the
###354 cabinet witness in this case right
###357 and that witness was one of the investigators and he claimed that vital
###360 records which holds the purse certificates in arizona claimed
###364 that they had canceled this woman's birth certificate because of forgery
###368 that the document was completely fabricated made up that it was not real
###371 however vinyl records justified said no that's not the case at all he is lying
###377 the president again israel it always has been it always will be
###381 i mean it's not really mobile hot
###382 can get away with lying on the stand like that
###385 lying to the grand jury about i'm sure though that for that line which is by
###389 the way it legal to do that on this for testimony
###392 that you'll spend for a half months in jail right near doubt but
###396 that's a good or arizona's a scary scary place man especially if you're latino
