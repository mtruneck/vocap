###8 THOMAS MORTON: Morning in Sarajevo.
###10 The cloud is lifting over the city.
###12 We almost died in our Yugo last night.
###15 So we decided to give it a rest and trade up for our
###18 fixer's Chevy Aveo.
###21 So you can see, the choice has made all the difference.
###23 We're automotively living in a lap of luxury right now.
###26 
###30 This is our fixer, Elvis.
###31 He's blind in one eye, which kind of makes him look like a
###34 Bosnian David Bowie.
###36 He's also wrecked three cars in the week we've known him.
###43 THOMAS MORTON: Yeah.
###43 I was wondering where all this mist came from.
###45 
###60 [HORN HONKS]
###62 THOMAS MORTON: Before the Serbs turned it into Hogan's
###64 Island in the '90s, Sarajevo was an extremely modern
###66 European city.
###68 It's also the biggest Muslim city in Europe.
###70 Though most residents are Muslims the same way, like,
###73 New Yorkers are Jews or Christians.
###74 They go to mosque for prayers and the holidays, but
###76 that's about it.
###77 All the men have shaved faces, most people
###79 drink, ladies wear jeans.
###80 It's relaxed.
###82 While the majority of Sarajevans and really Bosnians
###84 in general are sort of Friday Muslims, Islam is still a
###88 really big deal.
###90 During the wars, the Bosniak Muslims became a cause celebre
###92 in the Arab world, with countries like Saudi Arabia
###95 and Afghanistan sending money for humanitarian aid and even
###98 funneling Mujahideen fighters in to lend a hand.
###101 All of which is basically a push to increase Arab
###103 influence in the region and stoke a national religious
###105 revival, which naturally would play into places like Saudi
###108 Arabia's political interests.
###111 This mega mosque in Sarajevo was built
###112 entirely with Saudi money.
###114 It's also on the grounds of the Saudi Embassy, which
###116 technically means it's on Saudi Arabian soil.
###119 And obviously the crowd here looks a little different from
###122 the congregation across town.
###123 
###126 Now, our goal right now is to see if we can meet some local
###131 Muslims and figure out what's going on.
###133 And figure out why they're more kind of into Islamic
###136 identity and, by possible extension, extremist Islamism
###141 in their parent's generation, or if that's true at all.
###146 MALE SPEAKER 1: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###148 
###162 THOMAS MORTON: How hard is it to keep up the faith, like, in
###164 this environment?
###166 MALE SPEAKER 1: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###168 
###197 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###198 THOMAS MORTON: Sarajevo and Bosnia's other big cities
###200 aren't exactly seed beds of fundamentalist Islam,
###202 at least not yet.
###204 But there's a village in the north of the country called
###206 Gornja Maoca that adheres to strict Wahabi Islam.
###210 The men there have beards.
###211 The women wear full niqab.
###212 It's kind of quaint.
###214 Well, quaint in the way that Western newspapers describe
###216 with things like "Afghanistan in Europee" and "a potential
###220 terrorist training camp."
###222 The residents of Gornja Maoca aren't super receptive to this
###225 criticism or really the media in general.
###228 Actually, almost every camera crew that's gone to visit them
###230 has been driven out of the village.
###233 In addition to just bad press, Gornja Maoca has also been
###236 raided by the local and national
###237 police numerous times.
###240 In 2010, the Bosnian DA's office sent 600 officers to
###243 the village to search for guns and evidence
###245 of terrorist activity.
###247 We were nervous about swinging by the village unannounced.
###249 However, our fixer, Elvis, spent the previous month
###252 hanging out with the Gornja Maocans at noon time prayers
###254 and has kind of become buds with some of the
###256 younger guys there.
###258 Which hopefully means we can stop by and have a nice,
###260 pleasant chat without having rocks thrown at our heads.
###262 
###265 
###274 THOMAS MORTON: To show our goodwill, or at least what we
###275 hoped would be perceived as good will, we left the camera
###278 in the back seat of the car and got out to wait for the
###280 villagers to finish there afternoon prayers.
###282 We don't want to look around, right?
###284 We did take a live microphone with us though, which may have
###287 been a slightly bad move.
###289 MALE SPEAKER 2: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###291 ELVIS: He wants to know who we are.
###292 Listen to us.
###294 MALE SPEAKER 2: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###295 
###298 THOMAS MORTON: We wanted to know if we could talk to them.
###299 ELVIS: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###303 MALE SPEAKER 2: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###305 
###308 
###313 MALE SPEAKER 2: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###315 THOMAS MORTON: That revving, by the way, is the village
###317 leader, who's probably pushing 70, pulling up on his Harley.
###321 I cannot describe how awesome he looked.
###326 ELVIS: No, not right now.
###328 ELVIS: No.
###329 MALE SPEAKER 2: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###332 ELVIS: OK.
###334 
###339 ELVIS: No.
###339 MALE SPEAKERS: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###343 THOMAS MORTON: No.
###345 We have none.
###345 MALE SPEAKER 2: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###348 ELVIS: Do not show up ever again.
###350 MALE SPEAKER 2: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###354 THOMAS MORTON: OK.
###355 We are sorry we have to leave.
###356 Please apologize.
###358 ELVIS: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###360 MALE SPEAKER 2: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###361 
###370 ELVIS: Right.
###371 THOMAS MORTON: Then we can.
###371 OK.
###372 MALE SPEAKER 2: Yes.
###372 THOMAS MORTON: Well, thank you and we're sorry.
###374 
###378 THOMAS MORTON: OK.
###381 MALE SPEAKER 2: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###382 
###387 THOMAS MORTON: OK.
###388 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###393 THOMAS MORTON: And that's somebody you had
###393 never talked to?
###397 THOMAS MORTON: OK.
###399 
###411 THOMAS MORTON: Well, yeah.
###414 Oh, this is not good.
###416 We just got here just a little before afternoon prayer.
###421 This angry dude came up and told him he had to leave and
###424 picked up rocks, which maybe he just picks up rocks, but I
###427 don't know.
###428 I saw that as kind of provocative.
###431 Sort of like picking up ammo.
###433 We're trying to regroup right now.
###434 We're back to the Serbian cemetery.
###438 This will be very disappointing if we're unable
###440 to talk to anybody.
###443 Especially because more and more I learn about these
###444 people, the less, like, you know, I wouldn't say I'm on
###449 their side, but the more I kind of respect them being off
###454 on their own and doing this shit.
###455 
###459 Fuck.
###460 
###467 Since it didn't seem like we were getting back in with the
###469 Wahabis, we decided to hang out with their closest Muslim
###471 neighbors, the Bosnian Eugene Mirman and his lovely wife.
###476 Do you have many interactions with the
###479 people from that village?
###481 AVDO: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###482 
###490 THOMAS MORTON: One of the reasons we know about this
###492 village is that the police has come up here a couple times,
###496 but they haven't found anything.
###497 Were you here?
###499 AVDO: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###501 
###519 AVDO'S WIFE: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###520 
###543 AVDO: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###544 
###565 THOMAS MORTON: Dispute being walked out of the village by
###567 bearded men with the rocks in their hands, the more we
###569 learned about Gornja Maoca, the more sympathetic we became
###572 to it's wacky Wahabist residents.
###574 Then two months later, one of those guys shot up the US
###576 Embassy with an assault rifle, which seems a little off.
###580 
###584 So what have we learned in the Balkans?
###587 My generation grew up ingrained with the idea that
###589 things like ethnic and racial and religious differences were
###591 ultimately just bullshit.
###593 The Balkans and the wars in the '90s is kind of a
###596 centerpiece of this way of thinking.
###598 We'll acknowledge that they have different cultures, and
###600 they live in different geographies.
###602 But we think about it the same way we think of people from
###604 different states, sort of like Americans versus Canadians.
###606 We say, hey, they look the same.
###608 So what's the freaking problem?
###609 As if that's some sort of solution.
###612 But the ethnic differences aren't what actually matters.
###615 It's the way people have internalized these differences
###617 and the way they've been doing so for 1,000 very messy years.
###621 This isn't unique to the Balkans either.
###623 There's isn't something intrinsic about Serbs and
###625 Croats that makes them hate each other, ditto Bosnians.
###629 What's really kind of scary is what happened here in the '90s
###631 could happen seriously anywhere on Earth.
###633 We're all just simmering pots of rage and intolerance
###636 waiting for an excuse to brutalize each other like
###638 fucking ape men.
###639 That's the real lesson in Yugoslavia, that and none of
###643 these clowns have any business making cars.
