0:0:5,916 --> 0:0:8,214
SARAH HARRIS: The first thing
that strikes you when you come


3
0:0:8,214 --> 0:0:12,2
to India is a sense of
extreme contrasts.


4
0:0:12,2 --> 0:0:14,54
While some people are still
shitting off the side of


5
0:0:14,54 --> 0:0:17,9
railway lines and eating from
banana leaves, other people


6
0:0:17,9 --> 0:0:21,65
are drinking Frappuccinos and
wearing Gucci sunglasses.


7
0:0:21,65 --> 0:0:24,54
Along with this feeling of
progress and moving forward,


8
0:0:24,54 --> 0:0:28,41
there's still this undercurrent
of tradition and


9
0:0:28,41 --> 0:0:32,75
religion and superstition and an
even more deeply ingrained


10
0:0:32,75 --> 0:0:34,56
caste system.


11
0:0:34,56 --> 0:0:37,74
I didn't realize quite how sharp
these contrasts between


12
0:0:37,74 --> 0:0:41,51
new and old India were until
I came here last year to


13
0:0:41,51 --> 0:0:44,26
research an article about
sex trafficking.


14
0:0:44,26 --> 0:0:47,87
And on my very first day here,
I met a group of temple


15
0:0:47,87 --> 0:0:52,84
prostitutes who told me about
this ancient Hindu system


16
0:0:52,84 --> 0:0:57,66
where prepubescent girls are
dedicated to a goddess, and


17
0:0:57,66 --> 0:1:0,75
for the rest of their lives,
they will become sex slaves of


18
0:1:0,75 --> 0:1:2,9
the temple.


19
0:1:2,9 --> 0:1:4,3
The name of that system
is devadasi.


20
0:1:4,3 --> 0:1:15,945



21
0:1:15,945 --> 0:1:19,84
This train's a little bit like
The Darjeeling Limited, except


22
0:1:19,84 --> 0:1:25,2

under our beds.


23
0:1:25,2 --> 0:1:28,362
And there's no one serving
sweet lime.


24
0:1:28,362 --> 0:1:29,612
Hello.


25
0:1:29,612 --> 0:1:31,88



26
0:1:31,88 --> 0:1:34,9
So in the beginning, being a
devadasi had nothing to do


27
0:1:34,9 --> 0:1:36,73
with prostitution.


28
0:1:36,73 --> 0:1:39,66
In medieval India, they were
glamorous temple dancers and


29
0:1:39,66 --> 0:1:41,82
held high social status.


30
0:1:41,82 --> 0:1:44,58
They performed sacred religious
rituals and danced


31
0:1:44,58 --> 0:1:48,45
for loyalty in the name of a
goddess called Yellamma.


32
0:1:48,45 --> 0:1:50,98
Over the centuries, the link
between the devadasis and


33
0:1:50,98 --> 0:1:53,56
their temples gradually
diminished, along with their


34
0:1:53,56 --> 0:1:55,26
social status.


35
0:1:55,26 --> 0:1:58,35
They became the paid mistresses
of priests, then


36
0:1:58,35 --> 0:2:1,85
kings, and later,
rich landowners.


37
0:2:1,85 --> 0:2:5,1
In the 19th century, Western
missionaries tried to abolish


38
0:2:5,1 --> 0:2:8,669
the tradition, calling it
grotesque and immoral, driving


39
0:2:8,669 --> 0:2:11,97
the devadasis underground.


40
0:2:11,97 --> 0:2:15,15
Today, devadasis are no
different to common street


41
0:2:15,15 --> 0:2:19,68
hookers, servicing drunk truck
drivers and bored businessmen.


42
0:2:19,68 --> 0:2:22,6
Even though the practice has
been illegal for over 20


43
0:2:22,6 --> 0:2:26,31
years, up to 3,000 girls are
still being secretly dedicated


44
0:2:26,31 --> 0:2:27,92

45
0:2:27,92 --> 0:2:31,49
We traveled to the border town
of Sangli, which straddles the


46
0:2:31,49 --> 0:2:35,83
two southern Indian states of
Karnataka and Maharastra.


47
0:2:35,83 --> 0:2:39,13
Its red light district is home
to hundreds of devadasi sex


48
0:2:39,13 --> 0:2:42,27

we were invited there by


49
0:2:42,27 --> 0:2:46,19
Anitha, one of its most
successful brothel owners.


50
0:2:46,19 --> 0:2:49,66
She's a member of an NGO called
SANGRAM, which fights


51
0:2:49,66 --> 0:2:52,51
to empower locals sex workers.


52
0:2:52,51 --> 0:2:55,7

painful, as our interpreter


53

were brothels, the goddess

112
0:5:55,0 --> 0:5:58,14

being a devadasi was nothing

prostitution isn't a choice.

story of the goddess Yellamma

death, reincarnation, and a

load of fat Hindu gods with blue
skin and gold bikinis,


133
0:7:3,35 --> 0:7:4,6

Pandu may want a better life for
his daughter, but for many


243
0:17:53,98 --> 0:17:56,58
other devadasis, there's a lot
of money to be made in


244
0:17:56,58 --> 0:17:57,9

generation.


245
0:17:57,9 --> 0:18:1,17

Now, we're on our way to another
village, about five


247
0:18:4,32 --> 0:18:6,57
kilometers outside of Mudhol.


248
0:18:6,57 --> 0:18:9,3
And most of women who live
there are from the madiga


249
0:18:9,3 --> 0:18:10,9
caste, and so most of them are


250
0:18:10,9 --> 0:18:13,71
vulnerable to becoming devadasis.


251
0:18:13,71 --> 0:18:16,62
One of the interesting things
about this village is that


252
0:18:16,62 --> 0:18:19,9
we're going to be able to go
to the house of a devadasi


253
0:18:19,9 --> 0:18:22,56
woman who's made a real career
out of prostitution.


254
0:18:22,56 --> 0:18:24,74
And she's built this enormous
house in the middle of the


255
0:18:24,74 --> 0:18:27,62
village as a kind of symbol
of the her success.


256
0:18:27,62 --> 0:18:31,9
So she can become a role model
to the other girls living in


257
0:18:31,9 --> 0:18:33,77
the village that becoming
a devadasi is


258
0:18:33,77 --> 0:18:37,21
a good way of life.


259
0:18:37,21 --> 0:18:40,42
The legendary owner, Champa,
doesn't even live here.


260
0:18:40,42 --> 0:18:43,37
She's too busy turning
tricks in Bombay.


261
0:18:43,37 --> 0:18:46,84
Inside, shiny display cabinets
of unused crockery line the


262
0:18:46,84 --> 0:18:49,37
walls as testaments
to her success.


263
0:18:49,37 --> 0:18:51,79
There were groups of village
children roaming around the


264
0:18:51,79 --> 0:18:55,13
house to gawp at her flickering
color TV sets and


265
0:18:55,13 --> 0:18:58,48
shelves of broken electrical
equipment.


266
0:18:58,48 --> 0:19:0,11
The message is clear--


267
0:19:0,11 --> 0:19:1,935
prostitution is a lucrative
business.


268
0:19:1,935 --> 0:19:4,67



269
0:19:4,67 --> 0:19:10,94
So this is the necklace, the
muthu, that the devadasi women


270
0:19:10,94 --> 0:19:12,19
wear when they get dedicated.


271
0:19:12,19 --> 0:19:15,96
And hers is just hanging on
the wall of her mud hut.


272
0:19:15,96 --> 0:19:18,95
She's an old lady called
Shavvavva, and she's one of


273
0:19:18,95 --> 0:19:21,69
the oldest devadasi women
in the village.


274
0:19:21,69 --> 0:19:25,53

she brought the very first

0:19:25,53 --> 0:19:27,57

276
0:19:27,57 --> 0:19:32,49
No one had ever seen a radio
before she brought it here.


277
0:19:32,49 --> 0:19:35,16
Walking through the village, we
notice Yellamma's presence


278
0:19:35,16 --> 0:19:35,79
everywhere.


279
0:19:35,79 --> 0:19:39,1
The locals told us that all
devadasis in the area were


280
0:19:39,1 --> 0:19:42,37
preparing themselves for the
full moon festival, which is


281
0:19:42,37 --> 0:19:44,32
apparently the most
important event in


282
0:19:44,32 --> 0:19:45,57
the Yellamma calendar.


283
0:19:45,57 --> 0:20:12,66



284
0:20:12,66 --> 0:20:15,78
After hearing so much about the
famous full moon festival


285
0:20:15,78 --> 0:20:19,81
in Saundatti, we drove four
hours out of town to catch the


286
0:20:19,81 --> 0:20:23,524
first day of this month-long
celebration of Yellamma.


287
0:20:23,524 --> 0:20:27,28
Just up there in the center of
that big arch is the face of


288
0:20:27,28 --> 0:20:31,4
the goddess Yellamma.


289
0:20:31,4 --> 0:20:34,655

0:20:34,655 --> 0:20:38,29



291
0:20:38,29 --> 0:20:41,68
Over the course of the 28 days,
more than half a million


292
0:20:41,68 --> 0:20:44,42
people will pass through
the temple doors.


293
0:20:44,42 --> 0:20:47,4
A heaving shantytown springs
up around the


294
0:20:47,4 --> 0:20:49,4
famous Yellamma shrine.


295
0:20:49,4 --> 0:20:52,44
The place is filled with garish
Hindu icons, Bollywood


296

music, sticky sweets, and the
symbolic red and yellow colors


297

304
0:21:9,6 --> 0:21:12,355

of Saundatti.

0:21:12,355 --> 0:21:15,72
It's here that for hundreds and
hundreds of years, all the

0:21:18,542 --> 0:21:20,86
which are now illegal.

And we're not allowed in, so
we just have to shoot from


309
0:21:22,94 --> 0:21:26,67
outside, but you can see
hundreds of people walking


310
0:21:26,67 --> 0:21:31,28
around, praying to
the goddess.


311
0:21:31,28 --> 0:21:33,315
Everything around the temple
is really, really colorful,


312
0:21:33,315 --> 0:21:36,34
and you've got all these red
and yellow dyes, which the


313
0:21:36,34 --> 0:21:37,78

314
0:21:37,78 --> 0:21:39,17
And this is to kind of


315
0:21:39,17 --> 0:21:40,901
represent the goddess Yellamma.


316
0:21:40,901 --> 0:21:43,99
And the green bangles are in
rows all along the side of the


317
0:21:43,99 --> 0:21:47,47
road here, and they're the
bangles that they put on the


318
0:21:47,47 --> 0:21:50,93
girls during their devadasi
dedication ceremonies.


319
0:21:50,93 --> 0:21:54,22
And tonight is the moon
celebration, and they'll smash


320
0:21:54,22 --> 0:21:56,716
their bracelets as a symbol
of widowhood.


321
0:21:56,716 --> 0:22:0,209



322
0:22:0,209 --> 0:22:4,68
This is also one of the places
where the women traffickers

0:22:4,68 --> 0:22:8,82
come and pick up potential
prostitutes.


324
0:22:8,82 --> 0:22:12,1

from big cities like Bombay


325

to these festivals to pick up

0:22:18,155 --> 0:22:22,59



328
0:22:22,59 --> 0:22:25,59
Amidst all the religious fervor,
there was a distinct


329
0:22:25,59 --> 0:22:29,67
feeling of secrets going
on behind closed doors.

Families are offered a generous
fee in return for


331
0:22:32,24 --> 0:22:34,64
their young daughters,
often under the


332
0:22:34,64 --> 0:22:36,77
pretense of a better future.


333
0:22:36,77 --> 0:22:39,49

like it was going to happen.

Westerners with cameras, we

weren't exactly inconspicuous.

The bright colors and energy
of the festival were


349
0:24:40,42 --> 0:24:43,35
overshadowed by the seedy
reality of a religious

child prostitution.

home was in the small village

to meet three generations of

the same family.

Nowhere are these clashes more
evident than in the plight of
