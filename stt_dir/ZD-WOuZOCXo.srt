0:0:4,21 --> 0:0:5,545
WALKER STERN: I'll show you
something we've been doing on


3
0:0:5,545 --> 0:0:7,0
our tasting menu.


4
0:0:7,0 --> 0:0:9,71
If you can tell me what it
is, you'll get a prize.


5
0:0:9,71 --> 0:0:13,446



6
0:0:13,446 --> 0:0:16,25
You know what it is?


7
0:0:16,25 --> 0:0:17,66
That's called celtuse.


8
0:0:17,66 --> 0:0:23,57
It tastes like a cross between
asparagus and lettuce, and it


9
0:0:23,57 --> 0:0:24,43
tastes nutty, too.


10
0:0:24,43 --> 0:0:25,97
It's a really interesting
flavor.


11
0:0:25,97 --> 0:0:28,54
We braise it with brown butter,
and we start with


12
0:0:28,54 --> 0:0:31,22
hazelnuts and greek yogurt.


13
0:0:31,22 --> 0:0:32,49
I don't want to even
show this.


14
0:0:32,49 --> 0:0:34,732
Roberta's is going to
jump on this, you


15
0:0:34,732 --> 0:0:35,33
know know what I mean?

[MUSIC PLAYING]


17
0:0:49,627 --> 0:0:51,532
WALKER STERN: My name
is Walker Stern.


18
0:0:51,532 --> 0:0:55,12
I'm the co-chef / co-owner
of Battersby


19
0:0:55,12 --> 0:0:56,53
restaurant in Brooklyn.


20
0:0:56,53 --> 0:0:58,3
JOE OGRODNEK: My name
is Joe Ogrodnek.


21
0:0:58,3 --> 0:0:59,78
I'm also the co-chef
/ co-owner of


22
0:0:59,78 --> 0:1:1,8
Battersby in Brooklyn.


23
0:1:1,8 --> 0:1:5,64
WALKER STERN: We met each other
in culinary school.


24
0:1:5,64 --> 0:1:8,44
And then probably about four
or five years later, we


25
0:1:8,44 --> 0:1:9,445
reconnected.


26
0:1:9,445 --> 0:1:10,96
I think the main thing was that
we just didn't really


27
0:1:10,96 --> 0:1:14,78
want to be working under
people or for owners.


28
0:1:14,78 --> 0:1:16,79
We were like, we can
make this happen.


29
0:1:16,79 --> 0:1:19,49
JOE OGRODNEK: We just had us
two and the will to do it.


30
0:1:19,49 --> 0:1:21,0
And we didn't have money.


31
0:1:21,0 --> 0:1:23,4
We didn't have a location.


32
0:1:23,4 --> 0:1:25,69
But we made it happen.


33
0:1:25,69 --> 0:1:27,61
WALKER STERN: I think kind
of on the outside we're a


34
0:1:27,61 --> 0:1:30,58
neighborhood restaurant, but
when you take another look you


35
0:1:30,58 --> 0:1:33,81
can kind of see that there's
a little bit more going on.


36
0:1:33,81 --> 0:1:36,86
JOE OGRODNEK: I would prefer to
eat at a restaurant that's


37
0:1:36,86 --> 0:1:39,45
a little bit more comfortable
environment like this, as


38
0:1:39,45 --> 0:1:41,71
opposed to a three Michelin
star restaurant.


39
0:1:41,71 --> 0:1:44,505
And don't get me wrong, I love
fine dining, but this is more


40
0:1:44,505 --> 0:1:48,9
a part of everyday life, and
this feels more real to us.


41
0:1:48,9 --> 0:1:49,92
This dish, probably more than
anything on the menu right


42
0:1:49,92 --> 0:1:52,47
now, reminds me of our
history with it.


43
0:1:52,47 --> 0:1:55,69
This is a very traditional way
to serve asparagus and morels,


44
0:1:55,69 --> 0:1:56,92
cooked with yellow wine.


45
0:1:56,92 --> 0:2:0,23
The morels are simmered
slowly with this wine.


46
0:2:0,23 --> 0:2:3,69
Then I'm going to add a little
bit of asparagus puree into


47
0:2:3,69 --> 0:2:7,77
the mushrooms and add a little
parmasean cheese.


48
0:2:7,77 --> 0:2:9,74
I'm going to finish the morels
with a little bit of


49
0:2:9,74 --> 0:2:12,15
unsweetened whipped cream.


50
0:2:12,15 --> 0:2:14,94
As the dish comes together, it
has a great combination with


51
0:2:14,94 --> 0:2:18,44
the grassiness of the asparagus,
the earthiness of


52
0:2:18,44 --> 0:2:23,89
the mushrooms, and that toasty
oxidation of the wine.


53
0:2:23,89 --> 0:2:26,34
WALKER STERN: We've been doing
this peekytoe crab parfait for


54
0:2:26,34 --> 0:2:27,47
a couple days now.


55
0:2:27,47 --> 0:2:31,16
And it's just a really awesome
peekytoe crab meat from Maine


56
0:2:31,16 --> 0:2:35,9
which has a really good
sweet flavor to it.


57
0:2:35,9 --> 0:2:38,19
And I'm going to layer it in
this glass with crab on the


58
0:2:38,19 --> 0:2:42,28
bottom, and then raw cucumber,
green apple, celery that's


59
0:2:42,28 --> 0:2:45,135
just marinaded in a little bit
of verjus, salt and pepper,


60
0:2:45,135 --> 0:2:46,3
and olive oil.


61
0:2:46,3 --> 0:2:49,34
And then on top of that I'm
going to do a fresh gelee made


62
0:2:49,34 --> 0:2:52,3
with green apple juice
and celery juice.


63
0:2:52,3 --> 0:2:55,0
And then on that I have a little
mousse that's shellfish


64
0:2:55,0 --> 0:2:56,82
stock that's acidified
with lemon juice.


65
0:2:56,82 --> 0:2:58,72
There's a little
spice in there.


66
0:2:58,72 --> 0:3:3,63
So it's got a lot of different
stuff going on in one thing.


67
0:3:3,63 --> 0:3:5,6
Definitely people look
at it and are like,


68
0:3:5,6 --> 0:3:6,54
what is this, at first.


69
0:3:6,54 --> 0:3:9,272
And then they kind of put their
spoon in and, I'm not


70
0:3:9,272 --> 0:3:11,4
sure, and then they're like,
wow, that's really good, and


71
0:3:11,4 --> 0:3:13,403
then they play with it, and
then it's gone in five


72
0:3:13,403 --> 0:3:14,653
seconds, so.


73
0:3:14,653 --> 0:3:16,16



74
0:3:16,16 --> 0:3:18,86
One of the good things about
having an open kitchen is you


75
0:3:18,86 --> 0:3:23,232
can really watch the guests
consume the food and can see


76
0:3:23,232 --> 0:3:27,88
first-hand if they're enjoying
it or what the reaction is.


77
0:3:27,88 --> 0:3:32,85
The third man is Michael Sowa,
basically the other cook here.


78
0:3:32,85 --> 0:3:35,48
So he's here all the
time like we are.


79
0:3:35,48 --> 0:3:37,21
We spend a lot of time together
but we hang out


80
0:3:37,21 --> 0:3:38,29
sometimes, too.


81
0:3:38,29 --> 0:3:40,33
It's different, hanging out
outside of work and being at


82
0:3:40,33 --> 0:3:42,81
work because we take our
jobs very seriously.


83
0:3:42,81 --> 0:3:45,48
When we're feeling up to it,
we'll all go out to eat


84
0:3:45,48 --> 0:3:47,6
somewhere together.


85
0:3:47,6 --> 0:3:49,81
We're going to be going
to Henry Social.


86
0:3:49,81 --> 0:3:51,17
Henry and Atlantic, please.


87
0:3:51,17 --> 0:3:54,516

JOE OGRODNEK: Henry Public.

0:3:55,95 --> 0:3:58,68
WALKER STERN: Henry
Public social.


90
0:3:58,68 --> 0:4:2,24
Well, we're going to see our
buddy, Marty, who manages


91
0:4:2,24 --> 0:4:3,92
Henry Public.


92
0:4:3,92 --> 0:4:5,3
JOE OGRODNEK: They've got a
turkey leg sandwich there


93
0:4:5,3 --> 0:4:6,56
everybody talks about.


94
0:4:6,56 --> 0:4:11,7
It's pretty tasty but they have
really good salad, bar


95
0:4:11,7 --> 0:4:13,89
food, oysters, sandwiches,
burger.


96
0:4:13,89 --> 0:4:17,2
And I think it's most known
for being a pretty cool


97
0:4:17,2 --> 0:4:17,86
cocktail bar.


98
0:4:17,86 --> 0:4:18,76
WALKER STERN: Yeah, it's
very cocktail-heavy.

100
0:4:28,44 --> 0:4:30,91
[? [TALKING IN BAR] ?]


101
0:4:30,91 --> 0:4:33,76
WALKER STERN: Marty McLoughlin,
he's the main guy


102
0:4:33,76 --> 0:4:34,59
over there.


103
0:4:34,59 --> 0:4:35,93
Runs the show.


104
0:4:35,93 --> 0:4:40,7
He's a loyal customer of ours,
too, so he's definitely in our


105
0:4:40,7 --> 0:4:40,94
neighborhood clique.


106
0:4:40,94 --> 0:4:44,63
Can I just suggest that we all
do a round of fernet, just so


107
0:4:44,63 --> 0:4:45,368
we can get us started?


108
0:4:45,368 --> 0:4:46,618
WAITER 1: Yeah, absolutely.


109
0:4:46,618 --> 0:4:50,29



110
0:4:50,29 --> 0:4:53,31
WALKER STERN: Marty, will
you join us please?


111
0:4:53,31 --> 0:4:54,765
MARTIN MCLOUGHLIN: Very nice
to have you gentlemen.


112
0:4:54,765 --> 0:4:55,25
WALKER STERN: Alright, Marty,
thanks for having us.


113
0:4:55,25 --> 0:4:55,735
Cheers.


114
0:4:55,735 --> 0:4:57,19
ALL: Cheers.


115
0:4:57,19 --> 0:4:58,44
MARTIN MCLOUGHLIN: Good meal.


116
0:4:58,44 --> 0:5:2,4



117
0:5:2,4 --> 0:5:3,89
JOE OGRODNEK: Walker and I, one
of the main things we have


118
0:5:3,89 --> 0:5:6,11
in common is that we're
serious cooks.


119
0:5:6,11 --> 0:5:9,29
We're willing to sacrifice much
more to get an end result


120
0:5:9,29 --> 0:5:11,57
than I think a lot
of people are.


121
0:5:11,57 --> 0:5:13,18
We are literally doing
everything from start to


122
0:5:13,18 --> 0:5:15,71
finish every single day.


123
0:5:15,71 --> 0:5:17,69
There's no prep cook peeling
onions or making


124
0:5:17,69 --> 0:5:18,86
the chicken and stuff.


125
0:5:18,86 --> 0:5:21,48
We go to the market, pick up
the produce, bring it back,


126
0:5:21,48 --> 0:5:23,61
put it away, prepare
everything.


127
0:5:23,61 --> 0:5:24,47
There's nobody else.


128
0:5:24,47 --> 0:5:25,14
It's just us.


129
0:5:25,14 --> 0:5:26,67
And it's kind of daunting.


130
0:5:26,67 --> 0:5:29,87
WALKER STERN: It's a really
simple formula.


131
0:5:29,87 --> 0:5:32,97
We all arrive in the morning,
we run around like crazy, we


132
0:5:32,97 --> 0:5:34,4
cook during service.


133
0:5:34,4 --> 0:5:35,76
And the next day
we do it again.


134
0:5:35,76 --> 0:5:38,88
There's no time for brunch or
events or anything like that.


135
0:5:38,88 --> 0:5:41,553
JOE OGRODNEK: I don't think
we're ever going to do brunch


136
0:5:41,553 --> 0:5:42,912
at Battersby.


137
0:5:42,912 --> 0:5:44,19
WALKER STERN: We hate brunch.


138
0:5:44,19 --> 0:5:48,9



139
0:5:48,9 --> 0:5:49,44
JOE OGRODNEK: Yeah, the food
here at Henry Public is really


140
0:5:49,44 --> 0:5:52,28
straightforward, kind
of comfort-y style.


141
0:5:52,28 --> 0:5:55,2
We started out with oysters,
which actually I don't recall


142
0:5:55,2 --> 0:5:57,41
the name of them right now--


143
0:5:57,41 --> 0:5:59,41
WAITER 1: And the oysters,
if you're interested, are


144
0:5:59,41 --> 0:6:0,41
Plymouth Rock.


145
0:6:0,41 --> 0:6:4,3
JOE OGRODNEK: --but they
were some of the best


146
0:6:4,3 --> 0:6:6,34
oysters I've had.


147
0:6:6,34 --> 0:6:7,265
WALKER STERN: These oysters are
great because it has the


148
0:6:7,265 --> 0:6:8,97
little handle, you know?


149
0:6:8,97 --> 0:6:11,12
Have you ever been in a bar
where they have that toilet


150
0:6:11,12 --> 0:6:13,56
seat with that little thing that
sticks out so you don't


151
0:6:13,56 --> 0:6:17,9
have to touch the piss cover.?


152
0:6:17,9 --> 0:6:18,53
This is like the
the same thing.


153
0:6:18,53 --> 0:6:21,21



154
0:6:21,21 --> 0:6:22,48
JOE OGRODNEK: We had the grilled
ram with farmer's


155
0:6:22,48 --> 0:6:25,475
cheese, which is really simple
but a great combination.


156
0:6:25,475 --> 0:6:29,28



157
0:6:29,28 --> 0:6:31,44
We had the turkey
leg sandwich.


158
0:6:31,44 --> 0:6:34,275
It's a can't-miss.


159
0:6:34,275 --> 0:6:36,245
We were definitely all talking
about how good that was.


160
0:6:36,245 --> 0:6:38,985
WALKER STERN:So this
thing is legit.


161
0:6:38,985 --> 0:6:44,79
Turkey leg cooked in milk and
black pepper on a gigantic


162
0:6:44,79 --> 0:6:46,44
grilled toast.


163
0:6:46,44 --> 0:6:47,57
JOE OGRODNEK: This turkey
leg sandwich is


164
0:6:47,57 --> 0:6:48,892
pretty fucking crazy.


165
0:6:48,892 --> 0:6:49,38
WALKER STERN: Yeah, dude.


166
0:6:49,38 --> 0:6:50,43
It's so good.


167
0:6:50,43 --> 0:6:52,962
JOE OGRODNEK: This totally
tastes like Thanksgiving.


168
0:6:52,962 --> 0:6:53,914
WALKER STERN: They have
a nice dessert here.


169
0:6:53,914 --> 0:6:55,164
JOE OGRODNEK: What's
the dessert?


170
0:6:55,164 --> 0:6:57,246



171
0:6:57,246 --> 0:6:58,198
WALKER STERN: It's
called Werthers.


172
0:6:58,198 --> 0:7:0,387
They're like little fried donuts
with with a caramel


173
0:7:0,387 --> 0:7:1,54
dipping sauce.


174
0:7:1,54 --> 0:7:2,86
Wilkinsons.


175
0:7:2,86 --> 0:7:4,11
Don't forget about
the Wilkinsons.


176
0:7:4,11 --> 0:7:6,84



177
0:7:6,84 --> 0:7:8,15
JOE OGRODNEK: There was a little
bit of a discrepancy on


178
0:7:8,15 --> 0:7:9,2
that one but--


179
0:7:9,2 --> 0:7:9,84
WALKER STERN: We
worked it out.


180
0:7:9,84 --> 0:7:12,93
JOE OGRODNEK: --it is
the Wilkinsons.


181
0:7:12,93 --> 0:7:16,6
WALKER STERN: We're all going
to Brooklyn Social.


182
0:7:16,6 --> 0:7:16,89
JOE OGRODNEK: Marty,
it's time.


183
0:7:16,89 --> 0:7:19,122
Quit fooling around
back there.


184
0:7:19,122 --> 0:7:20,372
WALKER STERN: Bye-bye.


185
0:7:20,372 --> 0:7:26,5



186
0:7:26,5 --> 0:7:27,76
JOE OGRODNEK: Brooklyn
Social, baby.


187
0:7:27,76 --> 0:7:31,32
WALKER STERN: The first
cocktail bar.


188
0:7:31,32 --> 0:7:35,0
MARTIN MCLOUGHLIN: I just left a
full restaurant to go drink.


189
0:7:35,0 --> 0:7:36,25
At least it's not being
documented.


190
0:7:36,25 --> 0:7:47,88



191
0:7:47,88 --> 0:7:49,66
WALKER STERN: It's very common
to see that kind of


192
0:7:49,66 --> 0:7:52,61
cocktail-centric bar, but
Brooklyn Social was definitely


193
0:7:52,61 --> 0:7:54,66
doing it there before
that was popular.


194
0:7:54,66 --> 0:7:58,6
So it's like that, but it's
not really overbearing.


195
0:7:58,6 --> 0:8:1,32
You can get a nice cocktail
there or you can just do beer


196
0:8:1,32 --> 0:8:2,43
or whatever.


197
0:8:2,43 --> 0:8:5,19
It's a really fun atmosphere.


198
0:8:5,19 --> 0:8:7,86
JOE OGRODNEK: Matt Walters,
he bartends for us at


199
0:8:7,86 --> 0:8:9,34
Battersby, as well.


200
0:8:9,34 --> 0:8:10,11
He's a great guy.


201
0:8:10,11 --> 0:8:11,877
WALKER STERN: Can you just start
us out with a round of


202
0:8:11,877 --> 0:8:14,322
car bombs, like four
car bombs.


203
0:8:14,322 --> 0:8:15,3
MATT WALTERS: Really?


204
0:8:15,3 --> 0:8:15,789
WALKER STERN: And then--


205
0:8:15,789 --> 0:8:19,212
MATT WALTERS: Yeah, sure.


206
0:8:19,212 --> 0:8:22,55
JOE OGRODNEK: They were out of
Bailey's, probably from too


207
0:8:22,55 --> 0:8:23,67
many car bombs there.


208
0:8:23,67 --> 0:8:26,15
MATT WALTERS: Do you want to
do a little adaptation?


209
0:8:26,15 --> 0:8:28,83



210
0:8:28,83 --> 0:8:30,27
JOE OGRODNEK: There was--


211
0:8:30,27 --> 0:8:31,85
what was the liquor
he used instead?


212
0:8:31,85 --> 0:8:32,798
WALKER STERN: I don't know.


213
0:8:32,798 --> 0:8:35,168
MATT WALTERS: Jameson,
[INAUDIBLE]


214
0:8:35,168 --> 0:8:37,64
and then egg white and sugar.


215
0:8:37,64 --> 0:8:38,12
JOE OGRODNEK: Yeah.


216
0:8:38,12 --> 0:8:38,96
That's what it was.


217
0:8:38,96 --> 0:8:39,95
WALKER STERN: We normally just
do straight car bombs.


218
0:8:39,95 --> 0:8:55,233
[MUSIC PLAYING]


219
0:8:55,233 --> 0:8:56,712
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE SPEAKER
1: Hey, who knows?


220
0:8:56,712 --> 0:8:57,205
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER
1: Cheers.


221
0:8:57,205 --> 0:8:57,698
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE
SPEAKER 1: Cheers.


222
0:8:57,698 --> 0:8:58,191
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER
2: Cheers.


223
0:8:58,191 --> 0:9:1,149
WALKER STERN: Cheers, guys.


224
0:9:1,149 --> 0:9:2,628
WAITER 2: You said you want
a shot of something?


225
0:9:2,628 --> 0:9:5,26
Like, something like a tequila
or fernet or whiskey?


226
0:9:5,26 --> 0:9:6,918
WALKER STERN:Ooh, now you're
speaking my language.


227
0:9:6,918 --> 0:9:8,337
WAITER 2: I'll take an order
for you, if you like.


228
0:9:8,337 --> 0:9:9,29
JOE OGRODNEK: Yeah, I mean,
I guess we could do--


229
0:9:9,29 --> 0:9:11,8
WALKER STERN: We could
do a fernet.


230
0:9:11,8 --> 0:9:12,29
JOE OGRODNEK: --could do a
fifth shot of the night.


231
0:9:12,29 --> 0:9:13,54
Why not?


232
0:9:13,54 --> 0:9:25,85



233
0:9:25,85 --> 0:9:27,77
WALKER STERN: Memory is a little
fuzzy at that point..


234
0:9:27,77 --> 0:9:30,47



235
0:9:30,47 --> 0:9:31,74
JOE OGRODNEK: We came
back to Battersby.


236
0:9:31,74 --> 0:9:40,22



237
0:9:40,22 --> 0:9:41,45
WALKER STERN: I was in
good shape, I think,


238
0:9:41,45 --> 0:9:43,31
until we got back here.


239
0:9:43,31 --> 0:9:45,86
Then it went downhill.


240
0:9:45,86 --> 0:9:47,148
JOE OGRODNEK: I don't know, I
just felt like business as


241
0:9:47,148 --> 0:9:48,398
usual to me.


242
0:9:48,398 --> 0:9:53,79



243
0:9:53,79 --> 0:9:54,678
WALKER STERN: Mike was good.


244
0:9:54,678 --> 0:9:55,166
JOE OGRODNEK: Yeah, he
was in good shape.


245
0:9:55,166 --> 0:9:55,654
WALKER STERN: Yeah.


246
0:9:55,654 --> 0:9:56,142
JOE OGRODNEK: Always.


247
0:9:56,142 --> 0:9:57,236
WALKER STERN: You can
always count on him


248
0:9:57,236 --> 0:9:58,564
to ground it down.


249
0:9:58,564 --> 0:10:2,548
Whoa, whoa, what's
happening here?


250
0:10:2,548 --> 0:10:3,544
MICHAEL SOWA: Making
pizza, dude.


251
0:10:3,544 --> 0:10:4,54
WALKER STERN: I brought
you a beer.


252
0:10:4,54 --> 0:10:6,55
MICHAEL SOWA: Thank you.


253
0:10:6,55 --> 0:10:8,36
WALKER STERN: It's
hot down here.


254
0:10:8,36 --> 0:10:9,61
You need to stay hydrated.


255
0:10:9,61 --> 0:10:15,94



256
0:10:15,94 --> 0:10:17,25
It's so hot down here.


257
0:10:17,25 --> 0:10:19,98



258
0:10:19,98 --> 0:10:21,374
That walk-in's really cold.


259
0:10:21,374 --> 0:10:27,182



260
0:10:27,182 --> 0:10:29,42
Yeah, we never get drunk
when we're working.


261
0:10:29,42 --> 0:10:35,4



262
0:10:35,4 --> 0:10:35,55
JOE OGRODNEK: I think--


263
0:10:35,55 --> 0:10:37,11
WALKER STERN: Mike definitely
doesn't drink


264
0:10:37,11 --> 0:10:39,39
JOE OGRODNEK: I think we all
take our jobs very seriously.


265
0:10:39,39 --> 0:10:42,5
And Mike probably maybe even
more so, because he started in


266
0:10:42,5 --> 0:10:43,78
the career a little
bit later on.


267
0:10:43,78 --> 0:10:47,61
So I don't know if he has a
feeling to push harder than


268
0:10:47,61 --> 0:10:50,34
most people, but I definitely
see that in him.


269
0:10:50,34 --> 0:10:53,35
He does a fantastic job pretty
much all the time.


270
0:10:53,35 --> 0:10:55,88



271
0:10:55,88 --> 0:10:58,23
WALKER STERN: Well, Mike
made us some pizzas.


272
0:10:58,23 --> 0:11:1,4
JOE OGRODNEK: Some fresh
mozzarella, tomato sauce,


273
0:11:1,4 --> 0:11:4,6
pesto, taggiasca olives.


274
0:11:4,6 --> 0:11:6,11
WALKER STERN: Mike,
would you like to


275
0:11:6,11 --> 0:11:9,57
explain the pizza favors?


276
0:11:9,57 --> 0:11:12,2
JOE OGRODNEK: Mike, where did
you come up with the idea for


277
0:11:12,2 --> 0:11:13,45
this pizza concept?


278
0:11:13,45 --> 0:11:16,473



279
0:11:16,473 --> 0:11:19,924
[LAUGHTER]


280
0:11:19,924 --> 0:11:32,249
[MUSIC PLAYING]


281
0:11:32,249 --> 0:11:36,22
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER 3: That's
fucking delicious, dude.


282
0:11:36,22 --> 0:11:38,42
JOE OGRODNEK: I don't think you
need a big budget or a big


283
0:11:38,42 --> 0:11:40,18
space to make great things.


284
0:11:40,18 --> 0:11:44,93
I just think you need passion,
and the will to do it, and the


285
0:11:44,93 --> 0:11:47,8
love for what you do.


286
0:11:47,8 --> 0:11:47,89
This is what we wanted.


287
0:11:47,89 --> 0:11:50,29
We wanted this for
a long time.


288
0:11:50,29 --> 0:11:52,52
WALKER STERN: This is just
an honest place.


289
0:11:52,52 --> 0:11:54,21
We stand behind what we do.


290
0:11:54,21 --> 0:11:56,6
JOE OGRODNEK: I think that we
have a good thing going here,


291
0:11:56,6 --> 0:11:59,65
and it's just going to get
better and better.
