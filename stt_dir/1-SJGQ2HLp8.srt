Hi lovely people of Food Tube. I am in Gozo,
beautiful Gozo. It's an island next to Malta.


2
0:0:16,67 --> 0:0:24,57
Yes! I'm gonna celebrate this beautiful island,
I'm gonna make my own homemade pizza - classic


3
0:0:24,57 --> 0:0:33,37
margherita. So simple, so easy. The world love
Pizza. Why you should go buy? Make your own.


4
0:0:33,37 --> 0:0:41,4
It's cheap and easy and it is delicious!
Let me show you how. A bowl, 500g of strong


5
0:0:41,4 --> 0:0:55,36
flour, 1 teaspoon of salt, sachet of 7g of
dried yeast, then you have here 325ml of warm


6
0:0:55,36 --> 0:1:3,869
water.
Straight in. Mix it Now can you see the salt


7
0:1:3,869 --> 0:1:13,229
on here? I'm gonna mix it, the salt with the
flour. The yeast goes inside then you mix


8
0:1:13,229 --> 0:1:17,7
it.
What is it about making pizza? It's fantastico!


9
0:1:17,7 --> 0:1:26,649
Turn it down, move the spoon, then start to
mix it.


10
0:1:26,649 --> 0:1:33,109
Fantastico!
This stage I need a little bit of flour, just


11
0:1:33,109 --> 0:1:40,28
a little bit. Put it on top. This is the way
you clean your hands. I love making pizza!


12
0:1:40,28 --> 0:1:46,289
You gather all together and that.
With the palm of your hand in one side, you're


13
0:1:46,289 --> 0:1:51,799
holding for the other one, you pull it and
you fold it, you pull it and you fold it and


14
0:1:51,799 --> 0:1:58,859
you carry on doing that, ok?
Then you get the other side, pull it and you


15
0:1:58,859 --> 0:2:4,81
fold it.
Now the dough is ready! Get the flour, just


16
0:2:4,81 --> 0:2:19,739
roll it a little bit. Get a knife, you do
one, two, three and four. It's about, 150g.


17
0:2:19,739 --> 0:2:29,78
Roll it, roll it. Now you've got four beautiful
portions of dough. Now I'm gonna proof the


18
0:2:29,78 --> 0:2:37,989
dough. First, we need a little bit of semolina.
If you don't have semolina use breadcrumbs,


19
0:2:37,989 --> 0:2:42,54
it works fantastic. This is what I used to
do. I'm gonna proof it. What is proofing?


20
0:2:42,54 --> 0:2:49,54
Yeast is alive. Soon as it touch water, start
to move it. Soon as it touch the flour, starts


21
0:2:49,54 --> 0:2:59,67
to feed. They create air. Oxygen goes bubbling
like oooooh. And it goes boobooboobooboo,


22
0:2:59,67 --> 0:3:6,849
double the size. Because they are happy! But
then, (sigh) they rested. They become very


23
0:3:6,849 --> 0:3:11,959
elastic, you can stretch them nice, I don't
mind.


24
0:3:11,959 --> 0:3:23,5
Put a little flour on top, put a damp cloth
on and let it proof for at least two hours.


25
0:3:23,5 --> 0:3:29,989
Here they are! (sings) Bam bam bam bam!
Flour. Look at that!


26
0:3:29,989 --> 0:3:39,76
They double the size. Press it and turn them
around again, pick him up. Look at that!


27
0:3:39,76 --> 0:3:47,12
Ok. Now there is a little hole here. Don't
try to stick it, try to take it from the sides


28
0:3:47,12 --> 0:3:54,1
of the pizza, put them on the middle. Then
with your finger, just press it. This is really


29
0:3:54,1 --> 0:4:1,189
fantastic. Stop!
We get nice tomato, or Passata will do.


30
0:4:1,189 --> 0:4:4,739
Or this particular one I've flavoured with
the garlic, it's easy.


31
0:4:4,739 --> 0:4:14,159
Stop from the middle, you do not need too
much tomato. Drizzle with some little olive


32
0:4:14,159 --> 0:4:22,32
oil. It help to flavour the pizza.
Little bit of salt. When you reach the stage


33
0:4:22,32 --> 0:4:33,33
to make the classic margherita, you need parmesan
cheese. This will be so delicious. Nice mozzarella.


34
0:4:33,33 --> 0:4:43,88
For each pizza you need about 50g of mozzarella.
Just break with your hands, it's so good.


35
0:4:43,88 --> 0:4:51,5
Basil, break it. Yes, with a nice drizzle
of olive oil again. Pallet, here you are.


36
0:4:51,5 --> 0:5:6,7
Little semolina on the pallet. Don't be afraid, readjust
it. Now a miracle will happen. Yes!


37
0:5:6,7 --> 0:5:10,71
This is very rustic!


38
0:5:10,71 --> 0:5:18,85
Oh yes! This is what
I call a pizza. Look at that! The perfect


39
0:5:18,85 --> 0:5:26,98
pizza! The tomato, the basil on top, the cheese,
the Gozo olive oil. Gozo I love you. You can


40
0:5:26,98 --> 0:5:32,86
put salami, you can put preserved vegetable,
make your own, it's ever so easy. If you want
