1
0:0:7,41 --> 0:0:14,19
The universe has long captivated us with its
immense scales of distance and time.


2
0:0:14,19 --> 0:0:25,91
How far does it stretch? Where does it end...
and what lies beyond its star fields... and


3
0:0:25,91 --> 0:0:33,449
streams of galaxies extending as far as telescopes
can see?


4
0:0:33,449 --> 0:0:39,16
These questions are beginning to yield to
a series of extraordinary new lines of investigation...


5
0:0:39,16 --> 0:0:44,7
and technologies that are letting us to peer
into the most distant realms of the cosmos...


6
0:0:44,7 --> 0:0:52,379
But also at the behavior of matter and energy
on the smallest of scales.


7
0:0:52,379 --> 0:0:56,61
Remarkably, our growing understanding of this
kingdom of the ultra-tiny, inside the nuclei


8
0:0:56,61 --> 0:1:6,78
of atoms, permits us to glimpse the largest
vistas of space and time.


9
0:1:6,78 --> 0:1:21,649
In ancient times, most observers saw the stars
as a sphere surrounding the earth, often the


10
0:1:21,649 --> 0:1:25,959
home of deities.


11
0:1:25,959 --> 0:1:32,2
The Greeks were the first to see celestial
events as phenomena, subject to human investigation...


12
0:1:32,2 --> 0:1:37,789
rather than the fickle whims of the Gods.


13
0:1:37,789 --> 0:1:44,78
One sky-watcher, for example, suggested that
meteors are made of materials found on Earth...


14
0:1:44,78 --> 0:1:49,63
and might have even come from the Earth.


15
0:1:49,63 --> 0:1:56,58
Those early astronomers built the foundations
of modern science. But they would be shocked


16
0:1:56,58 --> 0:2:3,69
to see the discoveries made by their counterparts
today.


17
0:2:3,69 --> 0:2:9,8
The stars and planets that once harbored the
gods are now seen as infinitesimal parts of


18
0:2:9,8 --> 0:2:21,75
a vast scaffolding of matter and energy extending
far out into space.


19
0:2:21,75 --> 0:2:25,7
Just how far... began to emerge in the 1920s.


20
0:2:25,7 --> 0:2:30,42
Working at the huge new 100-inch Hooker Telescope
on California's Mt. Wilson,


21
0:2:30,42 --> 0:2:35,64
astronomer Edwin Hubble, along with his assistant
named Milt Humason, analyzed the light of


22
0:2:35,64 --> 0:2:38,87
fuzzy patches of sky... known then as nebulae.


23
0:2:38,87 --> 0:2:44,11
They showed that these were actually distant
galaxies far beyond our own.


24
0:2:44,11 --> 0:2:49,36
Hubble and Humason discovered that most of
them are moving away from us. The farther


25
0:2:49,36 --> 0:2:53,17
out they looked, the faster they were receding.


26
0:2:53,17 --> 0:3:2,6
This fact, now known as Hubble's law, suggests
that there must have been a time when the


27
0:3:2,6 --> 0:3:8,69
matter in all these galaxies was together
in one place.


28
0:3:8,69 --> 0:3:17,8
That time... when our universe sprung forth...
has come to be called the Big Bang.


29
0:3:17,8 --> 0:3:24,85
How large the cosmos has gotten since then
depends on how long its been growing... and


30
0:3:24,85 --> 0:3:26,67
its expansion rate.


31
0:3:26,67 --> 0:3:32,4
Recent precision measurements gathered by
the Hubble space telescope and other instruments


32
0:3:32,4 --> 0:3:34,38
have brought a consensus...


33
0:3:34,38 --> 0:3:36,67
That the universe dates back 13.7 billion
years.


34
0:3:36,67 --> 0:3:47,709
Its radius, then, is the distance a beam of
light would have traveled in that time ...


35
0:3:47,709 --> 0:3:50,1
 13.7 billion light years.


36
0:3:50,1 --> 0:3:52,4
That works out to about 1.3 quadrillion kilometers.


37
0:3:52,4 --> 0:3:59,459
In fact, it's even bigger.... Much bigger.
How it got so large, so fast, was until recently


38
0:3:59,459 --> 0:4:0,52
a deep mystery.


39
0:4:0,52 --> 0:4:10,8
That the universe could expand had been predicted
back in 1917 by Albert Einstein, except that


40
0:4:10,8 --> 0:4:12,23
Einstein himself didn't believe it...


41
0:4:12,23 --> 0:4:16,15
until he saw Hubble and Humason's evidence.


42
0:4:16,15 --> 0:4:21,489
Einstein's general theory of relativity suggested
that galaxies could be moving apart because


43
0:4:21,489 --> 0:4:23,57
space itself is expanding.


44
0:4:23,57 --> 0:4:29,91
So when a photon gets blasted out from a distant
star, it moves through a cosmic landscape


45
0:4:29,91 --> 0:4:34,96
that is getting larger and larger, increasing
the distance it must travel to reach us.


46
0:4:34,96 --> 0:4:42,19
In 1995, the orbiting telescope named for
Edwin Hubble began to take the measure of


47
0:4:42,19 --> 0:4:51,6
the universe... by looking for the most distant
galaxies it could see.


48
0:4:51,6 --> 0:4:56,68
Taking the expansion of the universe into
account, the space telescope found galaxies


49
0:4:56,68 --> 0:5:2,3
that are now almost 46 billion light years
away from us in each direction... and almost


50
0:5:2,3 --> 0:5:5,24
92 billion light years from each other.


51
0:5:5,24 --> 0:5:10,8
And that would be the whole universe... according
to a straightforward model of the big bang.


52
0:5:10,8 --> 0:5:17,27
But remarkably, that might be a mere speck
within the universe as a whole, according


53
0:5:17,27 --> 0:5:21,6
to a dramatic new theory that describes the
origins of the cosmos.


54
0:5:21,6 --> 0:5:28,5
It's based on the discovery that energy is
constantly welling up from the vacuum of space


55
0:5:28,5 --> 0:5:32,72
in the form of particles of opposite charge...
matter and anti-matter.


56
0:5:32,72 --> 0:5:40,419
Back in the 1980s, the physicist Alan Guth
proposed that energy fields embedded in the


57
0:5:40,419 --> 0:5:45,449
vacuum of space suddenly tipped into a higher
energy state...


58
0:5:45,449 --> 0:5:49,699
causing space and time to literally "inflate"...


59
0:5:49,699 --> 0:5:59,4
...to go from atomic size... to cosmological
size within an infinitesimally short time.


60
0:5:59,4 --> 0:6:3,85
As a result, according to one calculation,
the universe as a whole...


61
0:6:3,85 --> 0:6:9,75
...would have grown to some ten billion trillion
times the size of the observable universe.


62
0:6:9,75 --> 0:6:12,21
That's ten followed by 24 zeroes.


63
0:6:12,21 --> 0:6:20,61
Put another way, the complete universe is
to the observable universe... as the observable


64
0:6:20,61 --> 0:6:26,36
universe is... to an atom.


65
0:6:26,36 --> 0:6:32,47
The fury of this period of cosmic inflation
helps explain the immense size and smoothness


66
0:6:32,47 --> 0:6:33,46
of the universe.


67
0:6:33,46 --> 0:6:39,54
But to succeed, the theory must also account
for how the universe produced what we see


68
0:6:39,54 --> 0:6:47,38
around us... all those stars and galaxies
and clusters of galaxies, and ultimately...


69
0:6:47,38 --> 0:6:51,55
us.


70
0:6:51,55 --> 0:6:55,82
Scientists are now seeking to piece together
the chain of events that launched our universe


71
0:6:55,82 --> 0:7:0,49
in its earliest moments... by generating what
you might call a "little bang."


72
0:7:0,49 --> 0:7:10,21
At the Brookhaven National Lab in New York
State, they are blasting gold atoms in opposite


73
0:7:10,21 --> 0:7:14,46
directions down tunnels almost two and a half
miles long.


74
0:7:14,46 --> 0:7:19,59
When these atoms reach velocities just short
of the speed of light, they are sent into


75
0:7:19,59 --> 0:7:22,0
a violent collision.


76
0:7:22,0 --> 0:7:27,66
A fireball erupts... reaching a temperature
exceeding two trillion degrees Centigrade.


77
0:7:27,66 --> 0:7:34,44
As far as we know, the last time anything
in our universe was that hot was about a millionth


78
0:7:34,44 --> 0:7:37,72
of a second after its birth.


79
0:7:37,72 --> 0:7:44,35
What interests the scientists is the splatter
of subatomic particles... a super-hot soup


80
0:7:44,35 --> 0:7:51,24
of quarks and gluons... particles that gave
rise to matter as we know it.


81
0:7:51,24 --> 0:7:57,99
In initial tests, this quark-gluon plasma
has shown a crucial property... extremely


82
0:7:57,99 --> 0:8:3,539
low viscosity or resistance to flow. Scientists
call this a perfect liquid.


83
0:8:3,539 --> 0:8:9,32
To grasp its importance, we go back to those
primordial energy fields that the theory says


84
0:8:9,32 --> 0:8:13,39
spawned the big bang.


85
0:8:13,39 --> 0:8:18,97
The thinking is that those fields contained
tiny fluctuations that were blown up to huge


86
0:8:18,97 --> 0:8:19,61
size during inflation.


87
0:8:19,61 --> 0:8:35,57
In the ultra-dense quark-gluon mix, these
fluctuations generated pressure waves, or


88
0:8:35,57 --> 0:8:43,319
ripples. As the universe evolved, these ripples
led to variations in the density of matter.


89
0:8:43,319 --> 0:8:48,709
Amazingly, the imprint of those primordial
ripples is out there today... first seen in


90
0:8:48,709 --> 0:8:53,85
a faint signal discovered accidentally back
in the 1960s.


91
0:8:53,85 --> 0:8:59,16
Working for the Bell Telephone Company, physicists
Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson had built a


92
0:8:59,16 --> 0:9:0,73
giant horn-shaped antenna.


93
0:9:0,73 --> 0:9:6,679
But wherever they pointed, the contraption
picked up excessive noise in the microwave


94
0:9:6,679 --> 0:9:8,559
portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.


95
0:9:8,559 --> 0:9:13,939
That noise turned out to match a prediction
made years earlier...


96
0:9:13,939 --> 0:9:22,49
That in the wake of the big bang, the universe
was filled with a cloud of extremely hot gas


97
0:9:22,49 --> 0:9:23,749
that scattered all light.


98
0:9:23,749 --> 0:9:30,429
As the universe cooled, the cloud dissipated.
Light then shone through.


99
0:9:30,429 --> 0:9:37,54
Over time it shifted... as the universe expanded
and cooled... to just the noise signature


100
0:9:37,54 --> 0:9:46,199
detected by Penzias and Wilson. What they'd
heard was the echo of the Big Bang.


101
0:9:46,199 --> 0:9:52,709
This image shows the smooth contours of the
light recorded by the Bell team. Scientists


102
0:9:52,709 --> 0:10:0,899
would have to look closer... to find the imprint
of cosmic inflation.


103
0:10:0,899 --> 0:10:7,74
The Space Shuttle Discovery lifted the Hubble
Space Telescope into orbit on April 24, 1990...


104
0:10:7,74 --> 0:10:12,989
in one of the most important scientific milestones
our time.


105
0:10:12,989 --> 0:10:17,339
Another launch, arguably just as important,
took place five months earlier.


106
0:10:17,339 --> 0:10:25,399
This was the Cosmic Observation Background
Explorer, COBE for short, was sent up to take


107
0:10:25,399 --> 0:10:30,959
a harder look at the microwave radiation discovered
by Penzias and Wilson.


108
0:10:30,959 --> 0:10:36,779
The results came out two and a half years
later. The early universe contained a pattern


109
0:10:36,779 --> 0:10:39,6
of hot and cold spots.


110
0:10:39,6 --> 0:10:45,739
One COBE scientist called it the fingerprint
of creation... for it showed the origin of


111
0:10:45,739 --> 0:10:52,949
the universe we see around us today... smooth
on a large scale, but with significant clumps...


112
0:10:52,949 --> 0:11:3,679
...from which gravity would form gas clouds,
then stars, and galaxies.


113
0:11:3,679 --> 0:11:8,489
With this cosmic template in hand, astronomers
set out to discover how the patterns and the


114
0:11:8,489 --> 0:11:10,269
dimensions of the universe evolved over time.


115
0:11:10,269 --> 0:11:18,91
In an age of computer controlled telescopes
and automated observing, astronomers could


116
0:11:18,91 --> 0:11:24,819
now launch huge international collaborations
with the goal of mapping a large fraction


117
0:11:24,819 --> 0:11:28,92
of the universe in three dimensions.


118
0:11:28,92 --> 0:11:35,519
At Apache Point in New Mexico, the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey set the standard for mass production


119
0:11:35,519 --> 0:11:36,16
astronomy.


120
0:11:36,16 --> 0:11:42,47
A series of steel plates are drilled with
holes that exactly match the location of galaxies


121
0:11:42,47 --> 0:11:44,579
in the night sky.


122
0:11:44,579 --> 0:11:49,3
After plugging fiber optic sensors into the
holes, the plates capture the light of hundreds


123
0:11:49,3 --> 0:11:55,61
of galaxies per night, and that light determines
their distances from Earth.


124
0:11:55,61 --> 0:12:6,36
Another survey is named the 2 Micron All Sky
Survey, or 2Mass, after the frequency of infrared


125
0:12:6,36 --> 0:12:10,639
light its detectors are tuned to capture.


126
0:12:10,639 --> 0:12:15,779
Here, these data go out to a region 60 million
light years across. You can see the local


127
0:12:15,779 --> 0:12:16,869
group of galaxies, dominated by Andromeda
and the Milky Way in the center. This is our


128
0:12:16,869 --> 0:12:19,209
neighborhood.


129
0:12:19,209 --> 0:12:23,449
Jump further out to a region about 200 million
light years across.


130
0:12:23,449 --> 0:12:29,459
Our galactic neighborhood merges into the
densely packed Virgo Supercluster... which


131
0:12:29,459 --> 0:12:33,379
is the nearest intergalactic city.


132
0:12:33,379 --> 0:12:38,4
Stepping out to a region over 320 million
light years across, you can see the full breadth


133
0:12:38,4 --> 0:12:38,829
of our local region of the universe.


134
0:12:38,829 --> 0:12:44,35
Galaxies line up in walls and arcs... that
bound an array of sparsely-populated voids...


135
0:12:44,35 --> 0:12:49,85
the rural cosmic countryside.


136
0:12:49,85 --> 0:12:55,79
Moving out with the data... this region is
over 650 million light years across...


137
0:12:55,79 --> 0:12:55,89
Then almost two billion...


138
0:12:55,89 --> 0:12:55,89
3.2 billion...


139
0:12:55,89 --> 0:13:4,389
And finally out to a region 6.5 billion light
years from end to end: the cosmic continent.


140
0:13:4,389 --> 0:13:9,949
In the middle of it all, our galaxy, so immense
from our Earthly perspective, is less than


141
0:13:9,949 --> 0:13:10,519
a speck.


142
0:13:10,519 --> 0:13:21,249
The 2mass study, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey,
and the 2 Degree Field in Australia have extended


143
0:13:21,249 --> 0:13:24,72
our maps to a quarter of the way back to the
beginning of the universe.


144
0:13:24,72 --> 0:13:33,29
They have laid out a grand cosmic roadmap...
and gravitational routes.


145
0:13:33,29 --> 0:13:43,6
Now COBE's successor, the Wilkinson Microwave
Anisotropy Probe, or "WMAP", was ready to


146
0:13:43,6 --> 0:13:48,79
scan the early universe for the fine-scale
origins of this cosmic atlas.


147
0:13:48,79 --> 0:13:54,949
WMAP was launched beyond any interference
from Earth... to a position balanced between


148
0:13:54,949 --> 0:13:56,79
the Earth and the Sun.


149
0:13:56,79 --> 0:14:6,139
There, for two years, its detectors took in
the pristine light of deep space.


150
0:14:6,139 --> 0:14:12,89
This is what WMAP saw... a pattern consistent
with the filaments and voids that had evolved


151
0:14:12,89 --> 0:14:18,339
in the universe at large... and with the tiny-scale
structures sketched by inflation at the very


152
0:14:18,339 --> 0:14:19,48
birth of the cosmos.


153
0:14:19,48 --> 0:14:27,79
Scientists at Brookhaven National Lab in the
U.S. and the new Large Hadron Collider in


154
0:14:27,79 --> 0:14:34,649
Europe will be probing ultra high-energy collisions
in the coming years to tease out more details


155
0:14:34,649 --> 0:14:35,709
of the early universe.


156
0:14:35,709 --> 0:14:38,17
Others are poring over the WMAP data for evidence
of its true dimensions.


157
0:14:38,17 --> 0:14:42,739
One group looked for repeating patterns that
could be evidence of pressure waves that might


158
0:14:42,739 --> 0:14:45,49
have ricocheted through the hot gas of early
times.


159
0:14:45,49 --> 0:14:52,389
They saw none...which implies that the universe
had grown so large during inflation that such


160
0:14:52,389 --> 0:14:53,639
waves could not cross it.


161
0:14:53,639 --> 0:15:1,16
Then they did the math... the entire universe
has a minimum diameter of 156 billion light


162
0:15:1,16 --> 0:15:7,79
years... not quite twice the size of everything
out there that we can see: the "observable"


163
0:15:7,79 --> 0:15:9,79
universe.


164
0:15:9,79 --> 0:15:18,299
What is its maximum size... and what's beyond
that?


165
0:15:18,299 --> 0:15:24,879
We will never know for sure what lies beyond
our visual horizon... but astronomers are


166
0:15:24,879 --> 0:15:33,749
turning up some surprising hints... in the
universe they can see.


167
0:15:33,749 --> 0:15:39,649
To ancient observers, the universe was made
of five classical elements... Earth, Water,


168
0:15:39,649 --> 0:15:41,319
Air, Fire...


169
0:15:41,319 --> 0:15:48,69
and a fifth: Quintessence... or space.


170
0:15:48,69 --> 0:15:57,189
Aristotle believed the stars, unchanging and
incorruptible, were made of this fifth element.


171
0:15:57,189 --> 0:16:2,569
Today, we are finding that space, in fact,
has a character of its own.


172
0:16:2,569 --> 0:16:7,869
Astronomers have calculated the gravitational
pull needed to bind stars as they orbit a


173
0:16:7,869 --> 0:16:13,9
galaxy... or galaxies as they orbit a cluster
of galaxies.


174
0:16:13,9 --> 0:16:20,19
They have found that there is simply nowhere
near enough visible matter there to hold these


175
0:16:20,19 --> 0:16:21,949
structures together.


176
0:16:21,949 --> 0:16:28,239
The missing ingredient, its identity still
unknown, they call: Dark Matter.


177
0:16:28,239 --> 0:16:35,59
In supercomputer simulations of cosmic evolution,
dark matter is added in to supply the gravitational


178
0:16:35,59 --> 0:16:39,559
tug needed to form the web pattern of filaments
and walls;


179
0:16:39,559 --> 0:16:44,119
voids and dense clusters we see in the universe
at large.


180
0:16:44,119 --> 0:16:50,249
But something else appears to be happening
on these large scales.


181
0:16:50,249 --> 0:16:55,23
Astronomers have been making refined measurements
of the cosmic expansion rate with a new type


182
0:16:55,23 --> 0:16:57,4
of distance marker.


183
0:16:57,4 --> 0:17:2,79
They wanted to know if gravity was slowing
down the pace at which the universe is spreading


184
0:17:2,79 --> 0:17:2,839
out.


185
0:17:2,839 --> 0:17:5,54
But what they've found comes as a shock:


186
0:17:5,54 --> 0:17:13,85
The markers they use, type IA supernovae,
are thought to burn at uniform intensities


187
0:17:13,85 --> 0:17:14,56
throughout the universe.


188
0:17:14,56 --> 0:17:22,3
By measuring changes in the brightness of
these so-called standard candles at various


189
0:17:22,3 --> 0:17:27,25
distances, the researchers have been hunting
for changes in the rate at which the Cosmos


190
0:17:27,25 --> 0:17:27,93
is expanding.


191
0:17:27,93 --> 0:17:36,74
They have shown that while local regions or
the universe are drawing together, the universe


192
0:17:36,74 --> 0:17:43,63
as a whole is not only expanding, it's accelerating
outward!


193
0:17:43,63 --> 0:17:48,96
The culprit is thought to be energy welling
up from the vacuum of space... similar to


194
0:17:48,96 --> 0:17:54,22
what occurred in the early moments of the
Big Bang, causing cosmic inflation.


195
0:17:54,22 --> 0:17:59,64
Now it's happening in minute quantities across
vast regions.


196
0:17:59,64 --> 0:18:6,25
Over time, this so-called "Dark Energy" has
grown to an astonishing three-fourths of all


197
0:18:6,25 --> 0:18:9,51
the matter and energy in the universe.


198
0:18:9,51 --> 0:18:14,92
With data like this pointing to an underlying
dynamic within our universe, some scientists


199
0:18:14,92 --> 0:18:21,27
have suggested its part of an even larger
cosmic dynamic... much broader and deeper


200
0:18:21,27 --> 0:18:24,85
than we've ever thought.


201
0:18:24,85 --> 0:18:30,56
There is a version of inflationary theory
that suggests we live in one of many universes....co-existing


202
0:18:30,56 --> 0:18:37,14
side by side but out of touch with one another.


203
0:18:37,14 --> 0:18:46,22
Like bubbles, they are continually rising
up... and expanding across the oceans of infinity.


204
0:18:46,22 --> 0:18:52,47
Just 500 years ago many people looked out
into space and saw a universe of lights...


205
0:18:52,47 --> 0:18:56,4
small and nearby... centered on the Earth.


206
0:18:56,4 --> 0:19:2,61
The birth of astronomy revealed stars far
from our planet...


207
0:19:2,61 --> 0:19:9,75
Galaxies... clusters of galaxies... then vast
walls and filaments of matter.


208
0:19:9,75 --> 0:19:14,87
Newer ideas about the size of the universe
amount to a quantum leap in our sense of scale,


209
0:19:14,87 --> 0:19:22,6
by extending these structures far, far beyond
our horizon.


210
0:19:22,6 --> 0:19:29,83
Do these discoveries push us, on our tiny
out-of-the-way planet, into a smaller and


211
0:19:29,83 --> 0:19:36,41
smaller corner of Creation?


212
0:19:36,41 --> 0:19:43,5
Or does our ability to comprehend and imagine
the far limits of time and space expand our


213
0:19:43,5 --> 0:19:45,76
importance... in the grand scheme of things?


214
0:19:45,76 --> 0:21:45,76
