###10 NECKFACE: Should I go away so you can say some stuff?
###11 PATRICK: No, that's fine.
###13 NECKFACE: Hi.
###14 Welcome back to the Epicly Later'd Show.
###16 This episode, our special guest is Neckface, who is
###20 standing right next to me with a skull.
###22 Does a lot of writing on walls.
###25 What else do you do?
###27 NECKFACE: I skate.
###28 
###31 [LAUGHING], I skate.
###33 I paint.
###35 I just do whatever makes me happy, and makes
###38 other people bummed.
###40 Zero trans fat.
###42 PATRICK: Is it a bunny?
###44 NECKFACE: No, it's a bat.
###47 These are bat ears.
###49 PATRICK: Those look like bunny ears.
###50 NECKFACE: No, it's a bat, dude.
###52 So it's like I'm Batman, and I'm hiding my identity.
###55 
###57 If I have this on, they're like oh, there's Neckface.
###60 When I take this off, it's like, oh, some random dude.
###64 My real face is my mask.
###67 This is Neckface.
###68 My real face is my mask.
###70 
###74 See all those people on the train there,
###78 everyone on the train?
###81 They don't know who you're filming.
###84 I pass by cops all the time, every day.
###88 Every time I pass by them, they have no idea.
###91 But if they knew, [LAUGHING].
###95 
###99 So I'm riding on this bridge, right?
###102 I'm just looking at the city like everyone else does.
###105 But not everyone else sees what I see.
###110 Buildings, buildings, buildings, oh, two billboards.
###114 Right there.
###115 One of them was the one for Neckface Begins.
###119 For me, I want to make people laugh.
###122 I want the person who is just bummed out, like, man, fuck
###127 that girl, like, fuck this place, like, I'm never going
###131 there again.
###132 Just so bummed, the person's so bummed out, right?
###134 And then he sees my thing on the streets, and it says
###139 Neckface, beat your kids.
###141 And if I bring a smile to that guy who's been so bummed out
###144 the whole day, or a whole week, then that's
###146 like, I feel psyched.
###150 It's just like growing up, just being a bad kid, doorbell
###153 ditching and kicking other people's trash cans over, this
###157 is what I was meant to be, I think.
###162 King Diamond is like my dad, my father figure.
###166 He's rad, man.
###168 King Diamond is like when you're trying all these
###172 flavors of Gatorade, and you're over all these Gatorade
###175 flavors, and then you finally find the fucking Riptide Rush.
###179 And you're like, what?
###180 This Gatorade's fucking sick.
###182 That's who King Diamond is.
###185 To me that's who he is.
###186 I was digging through all these little whatever things.
###192 And I found King Diamond, and that's the guy for me.
###196 The dream that I just had of me turning into a bat and
###200 flying away makes sense.
###202 PATRICK: Is this your inspiration board?
###203 NECKFACE: It is my inspiration board.
###205 And I need to change it.
###207 This is a squishy face.
###210 It's a doll.
###210 Somebody made that.
###212 It's Eddie, from Iron Maiden, who's actually
###215 coming out of a shirt.
###216 That's not a graphic.
###217 That's him coming out of a shirt.
###220 This girl gave me a whole bag of stuff for my birthday, a
###224 bunch of random stuff from her house.
###226 And this guy was in there.
###228 That's where that guy came from.
###230 My parents didn't care about me watching
###232 rated R movie, or something.
###234 So I was watching all this crazy shit, like Freddy
###237 Krueger and Nightmare on Elm Street and Jason, and all that
###241 stuff at a young age.
###243 And it's just really like a comic relief.
###248 [EVIL CACKLE]
###252 NECKFACE: If I see a old lady fall down on the street, it
###255 may not be violent, but she fell down on the street.
###258 Of course I'm going to laugh.
###260 Oh yeah, this is a new style, using watercolors.
###263 Trying to take the beautiful water colors, that everyone--
###267 oh, they're so pretty, watercolors,
###270 paint a rain forest.
###272 And then I get the watercolors, and then I just
###275 fuck it up.
###277 I just mess it up and make this fucked up guy here,
###282 taking your water color and creating a mess out of it.
###289 PATRICK: You went to art school for a while.
###290 NECKFACE: Yeah, I went to art school for two years and
###292 realized that it sucked dick.
###294 So I dropped out.
###295 
###298 PATRICK: Those are the originals?
###299 NECKFACE: Yeah, these are the originals.
###302 I don't know what the fuck that is.
###304 
###308 I think that might be on Terry's board.
###310 Braden has this tattooed on his arm, that guy.
###315 This one is on Terry Kennedy's board, too.
###318 Devil slam dunking, nobody knows that the devil plays
###320 basketball.
###322 I'm doing the same thing I've been doing for years.
###324 And it's like, finally people are like, oh, his
###327 art's pretty cool.
###329 Maybe we'll give him a show.
###330 But it's like the whole world against me.
###333 Like, fuck that guy, he sucks.
###336 I'm not going to be like, OK, everyone hates me.
###338 I'm going to stop.
###340 No.
###340 No fucking way.
###341 I'm going to still be out there, even if
###343 you hate me or not.
###345 PATRICK: How did you learn how to papier-mache?
###347 NECKFACE: Not even elementary school.
###348 Like where you have to make the balloon, and then you put
###351 the papier-mache over it.
###353 And then you pop the balloon, and the thing still stays,
###356 because it's dry?
###357 
###359 Like that.
###360 I think I learned more in school in the early years than
###364 in the later years.
###364 Because in the later years, I didn't give
###366 a fuck about school.
###367 
###370 So I think if you're a teacher, you should teach the
###374 kid as much as you can in the beginning years of school,
###377 than towards the end of school.
###378 Because the end school sucks when you start figuring out,
###381 fuck school.
###382 I like skateboarding.
###383 I'm not going to go to school no more.
###387 Thar's what I think.
###388
