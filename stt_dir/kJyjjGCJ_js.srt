1
0:0:48,548 --> 0:0:53,428
There's something I wanna tell you.


2
0:0:53,428 --> 0:0:56,681
After I got shot...


3
0:0:56,681 --> 0:0:59,851
...you wanna know the very first thing
that entered my mind...


4
0:0:59,851 --> 0:1:5,23
...before l blacked out?


5
0:1:5,23 --> 0:1:9,27
Coins.


6
0:1:9,27 --> 0:1:13,823
I'm 8 years old again
on a tour of the U.S. Mint.


7
0:1:13,823 --> 0:1:17,16
I'm Iistening to a guide expIain
how coins are made.


8
0:1:17,16 --> 0:1:19,788
How they're punched
out of sheet metal.


9
0:1:19,788 --> 0:1:22,165
How they're rimmed and beveled.


10
0:1:22,165 --> 0:1:25,1
How they are stamped and cleaned.


11
0:1:25,1 --> 0:1:28,838
And how each and every batch
of coins are personalIy examined.


12
0:1:28,838 --> 0:1:33,301
Just in case any have sLipped through
with the sIightest imperfection.


13
0:1:33,301 --> 0:1:36,679
That's what popped into my head.


14
0:1:36,679 --> 0:1:40,6
I am a coin
in the United states Army.


15
0:1:40,6 --> 0:1:45,73
I was minted in the year 1 980.
I've been punched from sheet metal.


16
0:1:45,73 --> 0:1:47,69
I've been stamped and cleaned.


17
0:1:47,69 --> 0:1:52,362
My ridges have been rimmed
and beveIed.


18
0:1:52,362 --> 0:1:56,324
But now l have
two smalL holes in me.


19
0:1:56,324 --> 0:2:0,245
I'm no longer in perfect condition.


20
0:2:0,245 --> 0:2:2,58
So there's something eIse
I wanna telL you.


21
0:2:2,58 --> 0:2:5,375
Right before
everything went black...


22
0:2:5,375 --> 0:2:10,421
...you wanna know the
very last thing that entered my mind?


23
0:2:10,421 --> 0:2:38,533
You.


24
0:2:38,533 --> 0:2:41,452
Why not? Because there are
a lot of things you'd be doing.


25
0:2:41,452 --> 0:2:44,998
Just like playing tennis.


26
0:2:44,998 --> 0:2:53,6
Wimbledon? I don't know.


27
0:2:53,6 --> 0:2:57,177
Just gonna go.
I'm gonna host the thing. Six-thirty.


28
0:2:57,177 --> 0:2:59,429
And you and I could go at 1 0?


29
0:2:59,429 --> 0:3:1,55
-Oh, shit!
-Oh, no!


30
0:3:1,55 --> 0:3:3,308
-Oh, no, Randy, no!
-I'm sorry.


31
0:3:3,308 --> 0:3:6,311
I'll get it, l'Il get it,
I'm on it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.


32
0:3:6,311 --> 0:3:7,604
Okay? I'm on it.


33
0:3:7,604 --> 0:3:9,105
My whole life is in that bag.


34
0:3:9,105 --> 0:3:33,546
I got it. I got it.


35
0:3:33,546 --> 0:3:42,972
You got it.


36
0:3:42,972 --> 0:3:45,767
Dude. I was gonna get that.


37
0:3:45,767 --> 0:3:47,56
I mean, thanks for jumping in.


38
0:3:47,56 --> 0:3:48,77
Yeah, no problem.


39
0:3:48,77 --> 0:3:51,648
But l mean, hey, I'll take it.


40
0:3:51,648 --> 0:3:54,984
Thank you so much!


41
0:3:54,984 --> 0:3:58,488
Who jumps off a 20-foot pier?


42
0:3:58,488 --> 0:4:2,742
Gosh, I'm a mess.
You are a lifesaver. I'm Savannah.


43
0:4:2,742 --> 0:4:4,786
-John.
-John.


44
0:4:4,786 --> 0:4:10,166
Brave man. This is my life in here,
so l owe-- I owe you.


45
0:4:10,166 --> 0:4:11,668
Don't worry about it.


46
0:4:11,668 --> 0:4:13,586
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.


47
0:4:13,586 --> 0:4:15,964
You all have a good night.


48
0:4:15,964 --> 0:4:19,8
Yeah, thanks.
I was in the water for that.


49
0:4:19,8 --> 0:4:23,137
I was seriously getting it for you.


50
0:4:23,137 --> 0:4:24,347
This guy's crazy.


51
0:4:24,347 --> 0:4:28,977
Yeah, no, I swear l'm not. I'm not
stalking you. I just gotta get my board.


52
0:4:28,977 --> 0:4:32,438
-Are you staying here?
-Yeah, yeah, I'm from around here.


53
0:4:32,438 --> 0:4:36,192
Hey, John, do you want to--?
My house is right over there.


54
0:4:36,192 --> 0:4:40,29
We were actually going back
right now. Do you want to join us?


55
0:4:40,29 --> 0:4:41,281
We're having a barbecue.


56
0:4:41,281 --> 0:4:44,575
It's okay. I don't want to intrude
on y'all. My dad's making dinner.


57
0:4:44,575 --> 0:4:46,244
Okay.


58
0:4:46,244 --> 0:4:53,42
Well, I could at least give you
a beer for the walk home.


59
0:4:53,42 --> 0:5:21,821
-Where is it?
-Right over there.


60
0:5:21,821 --> 0:5:24,574
-You in the military or something?
-Yeah.


61
0:5:24,574 --> 0:5:26,75
Really?


62
0:5:26,75 --> 0:5:28,369
What branch are you in?


63
0:5:28,369 --> 0:5:30,83
Army, SpeciaI Forces.


64
0:5:30,83 --> 0:5:37,92
Oh, Special Forces.
That's impressive. That's....


65
0:5:37,92 --> 0:5:41,758
Is that like a Special Forces ring they
give you? ls that what it says on it?


66
0:5:41,758 --> 0:5:43,843
It looks nice on you.


67
0:5:43,843 --> 0:5:47,472
Aren't you supposed to be wearing
a hat too? Like a French hat, a beret.


68
0:5:47,472 --> 0:5:49,39
-That's what it's called?
-Randy.


69
0:5:49,39 --> 0:5:50,808
I'm just joking with him.


70
0:5:50,808 --> 0:5:56,105
You shouIdn't make fun of a guy
who can kill you with his bare hands.


71
0:5:56,105 --> 0:5:58,66
Big guy.


72
0:5:58,66 --> 0:6:0,526
Rock them, sock them, let's go.


73
0:6:0,526 --> 0:6:3,71
How about that?


74
0:6:3,71 --> 0:6:5,531
You know, I'm gonna go get a beer.


75
0:6:5,531 --> 0:6:13,456
Soldier. Pleasure.


76
0:6:13,456 --> 0:6:16,417
I'm sorry about him.
He thinks he likes me.


77
0:6:16,417 --> 0:6:18,628
Yeah, I think he likes you too.


78
0:6:18,628 --> 0:6:27,804
No, I'm not his type.
He just doesn't know it yet.


79
0:6:27,804 --> 0:6:30,98
What?


80
0:6:30,98 --> 0:6:34,685
Come on, I just think
you're probably everybody's type.


81
0:6:34,685 --> 0:6:36,187
See what I mean?


82
0:6:36,187 --> 0:6:42,68
Is this who l think it is? Alan, Alan.


83
0:6:42,68 --> 0:6:45,71
Hey, buddy, I want you to meet John.
John, this is Alan.


84
0:6:45,71 --> 0:6:47,657
-Alan, nice to meet you.
-Say hi.


85
0:6:47,657 --> 0:6:49,826
He's a little bit shy, isn't he?


86
0:6:49,826 --> 0:6:51,494
Hey, where's your dad?


87
0:6:51,494 --> 0:6:55,456
-Over there.
-Two steps behind, as usual.


88
0:6:55,456 --> 0:6:59,1
Sorry, he's like a heat-seeking missile
every time he sees you.


89
0:6:59,1 --> 0:7:0,795
-Oh, hey, l'm Tim.
-John.


90
0:7:0,795 --> 0:7:2,88
Sorry.


91
0:7:2,88 --> 0:7:3,464
Nice to meet you.


92
0:7:3,464 --> 0:7:5,508
Oh, you SpeciaI Forces, huh?


93
0:7:5,508 --> 0:7:8,302
Yes, sir.


94
0:7:8,302 --> 0:7:10,388
You stationed out at Fort Bragg?


95
0:7:10,388 --> 0:7:13,307
No, Germany, actually.


96
0:7:13,307 --> 0:7:15,852
-Oh, you're on leave.
-Yes, sir.


97
0:7:15,852 --> 0:7:18,187
I hope you're enjoying yourself.


98
0:7:18,187 --> 0:7:21,65
Yeah, I think I am.


99
0:7:21,65 --> 0:7:24,61
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.
It's nice to meet you though.


100
0:7:24,61 --> 0:7:31,826
-Nice to meet you too.
-Come on, son. Let's go.


101
0:7:31,826 --> 0:7:34,36
Let's go.


102
0:7:34,36 --> 0:7:35,997
Hello. Hello, John.


103
0:7:35,997 --> 0:7:41,794
Hello, Alan.


104
0:7:41,794 --> 0:7:45,882
-Wow, that was really amazing.
-Yeah?


105
0:7:45,882 --> 0:7:48,718
He never talks to anybody.
Only his family.


106
0:7:48,718 --> 0:7:50,52
He talked to you.


107
0:7:50,52 --> 0:7:54,265
Yeah, but I'm practicaIly his family.
I've known him since he was born.


108
0:7:54,265 --> 0:8:4,192
Yeah?


109
0:8:4,192 --> 0:8:6,152
When do you go back?


110
0:8:6,152 --> 0:8:8,613
Two weeks.


111
0:8:8,613 --> 0:8:12,74
It must be scary what you do.


112
0:8:12,74 --> 0:8:15,953
Boring mostly.
You know, long stretches of boring.


113
0:8:15,953 --> 0:8:18,706
Occasional flashes of scary.


114
0:8:18,706 --> 0:8:24,587
Full moon tonight.


115
0:8:24,587 --> 0:8:29,258
Do you ever notice how big
the moon is when it's rising?


116
0:8:29,258 --> 0:8:33,179
And how little it gets
when it's up in the sky.


117
0:8:33,179 --> 0:8:35,848
You know,
that's just your perspective.


118
0:8:35,848 --> 0:8:39,6
It doesn't matter where it is
in the sky or where you are...


119
0:8:39,6 --> 0:8:43,189
...if you hold your hand up
and close one of your eyes...


120
0:8:43,189 --> 0:8:50,78
...it's never bigger than your thumb.


121
0:8:50,78 --> 0:8:52,782
Where'd you Iearn that?


122
0:8:52,782 --> 0:8:55,76
I don't know.


123
0:8:55,76 --> 0:9:4,377
Somewhere.


124
0:9:4,377 --> 0:9:8,422
You just made your own fire.


125
0:9:8,422 --> 0:9:11,3
That's very impressive.


126
0:9:11,3 --> 0:9:15,263
Very primal.


127
0:9:15,263 --> 0:9:18,724
But you're still not gonna
be abIe to cook that hotdog, I fear.


128
0:9:18,724 --> 0:9:22,19
I fear that as well.


129
0:9:22,19 --> 0:9:24,73
I should probably
be getting going anyways.


130
0:9:24,73 --> 0:9:29,485
I'm sorry. I hope you don't get into
too much trouble.


131
0:9:29,485 --> 0:9:32,655
I think it's probably too late for that.


132
0:9:32,655 --> 0:9:35,199
Yeah.


133
0:9:35,199 --> 0:9:36,993
Thank you.


134
0:9:36,993 --> 0:9:43,874
Yeah. No, you're welcome.


135
0:9:43,874 --> 0:9:47,169
Would you wanna maybe
do this again tomorrow night?


136
0:9:47,169 --> 0:9:50,172
Tomorrow is chicken.
I don't think you're gonna wanna try it.


137
0:9:50,172 --> 0:9:53,759
I was kind of hoping maybe we'd let
somebody else do the cooking.


138
0:9:53,759 --> 0:9:55,72
Type of thing.


139
0:9:55,72 --> 0:9:59,724
-Okay.
-Yeah?


140
0:9:59,724 --> 0:10:5,62
So maybe I'll come by around
6 or something?


141
0:10:5,62 --> 0:10:11,36
-Okay.
-All right.


142
0:10:11,36 --> 0:10:13,362
So l'Il see you soon, then?


143
0:10:13,362 --> 0:10:14,947
I'll see you soon, then.


144
0:10:14,947 --> 0:10:27,793
Yeah. Soon.


145
0:10:27,793 --> 0:10:30,421
-Hey.
-Hey, man.


146
0:10:30,421 --> 0:10:33,299
We're headed into town
for some ice cream. You want a ride?


147
0:10:33,299 --> 0:10:38,387
No, no, no, it's fine.
I don't mind walking at aIl. It's fine.


148
0:10:38,387 --> 0:10:41,39
Sure?


149
0:10:41,39 --> 0:10:44,477
-All right. I appreciate it.
-Yeah.


150
0:10:44,477 --> 0:10:46,354
Hey, AIan, move on over here.


151
0:10:46,354 --> 0:10:50,66
Here, l'Il undo your belt.


152
0:10:50,66 --> 0:10:54,153
Five, six, seven, eight...


153
0:10:54,153 --> 0:10:56,697
-So how long are you in town for?
-...nine.


154
0:10:56,697 --> 0:10:58,24
We Iive here year-round now.


155
0:10:58,24 --> 0:11:1,243
Yeah, we were driving down
every weekend anyways...


156
0:11:1,243 --> 0:11:6,415
...so I finalIy just convinced my wife
this just made the most sense.


157
0:11:6,415 --> 0:11:8,584
-She didn't want ice cream?
-Who?


158
0:11:8,584 --> 0:11:12,338
Oh, my wife. No.


159
0:11:12,338 --> 0:11:14,965
No, actualIy
she's on vacation herself.


160
0:11:14,965 --> 0:11:17,76
White sheep, white sheep,
white sheep.


161
0:11:17,76 --> 0:11:21,847
-It's difficult to take trips together.
-White sheep.


162
0:11:21,847 --> 0:11:26,227
It's fine. We make it work.


163
0:11:26,227 --> 0:11:37,863
I'm up here on the left.


164
0:11:37,863 --> 0:11:40,366
Hey, John.


165
0:11:40,366 --> 0:11:43,994
For the record,
if you do anything to hurt Savannah...


166
0:11:43,994 --> 0:11:46,288
...l'm gonna
have to break something.


167
0:11:46,288 --> 0:11:51,752
Something in your leg.
Some-- One of the bones in there.


168
0:11:51,752 --> 0:11:53,45
Okay.


169
0:11:53,45 --> 0:11:58,467
It's just l know her father and he would
expect me to say something like that.


170
0:11:58,467 --> 0:12:2,388
It'd just sound a lot more natural
coming out of his mouth.


171
0:12:2,388 --> 0:12:6,976
It sounded fine.


172
0:12:6,976 --> 0:12:8,477
-No, it--
-Yes, it did.


173
0:12:8,477 --> 0:12:10,521
-No, it didn't.
-It did. It really did.


174
0:12:10,521 --> 0:12:11,939
It didn't. But thank you.


175
0:12:11,939 --> 0:12:14,24
-It reaIly did.
-You think so?


176
0:12:14,24 --> 0:12:15,484
Yeah, it did.


177
0:12:15,484 --> 0:12:18,863
Okay.


178
0:12:18,863 --> 0:12:24,285
Hey, don't honk the horn,
it's nighttime.


179
0:12:24,285 --> 0:12:28,497
-Good night, John.
-Good night, Tim.


180
0:12:28,497 --> 0:13:6,911
-Thanks for the ride.
-Yeah, no problem.


181
0:13:6,911 --> 0:13:11,373
Hey, Dad, l'm not gonna be able
to stay for dinner.


182
0:13:11,373 --> 0:13:13,793
Well, I made lasagna.


183
0:13:13,793 --> 0:13:18,5
I know you made lasagna.
It's Sunday.


184
0:13:18,5 --> 0:13:28,766
Can l borrow the car?


185
0:13:28,766 --> 0:13:33,521
Thanks.


186
0:13:33,521 --> 0:13:36,148
-Best seafood you'll ever have.
-Yeah, I know.


187
0:13:36,148 --> 0:13:38,275
-I used to come here aIl the time.
-Really?


188
0:13:38,275 --> 0:13:41,32
Are you sure you don't wanna go
somewhere, I don't know, nice?


189
0:13:41,32 --> 0:13:44,615
Nice? No, I wanna go
somewhere good.


190
0:13:44,615 --> 0:13:49,203
Okay.


191
0:13:49,203 --> 0:13:53,666
What the hell you doing here?


192
0:13:53,666 --> 0:13:57,67
Come on, Steve.
It's been three years already.


193
0:13:57,67 --> 0:13:59,38
I don't want any trouble here.


194
0:13:59,38 --> 0:14:2,883
You're not gonna get any. I promise.


195
0:14:2,883 --> 0:14:4,51
All right.


196
0:14:4,51 --> 0:14:10,349
Thank you.


197
0:14:10,349 --> 0:14:12,476
What happened
with that guy out there?


198
0:14:12,476 --> 0:14:14,687
-What guy?
-What's the story with him?


199
0:14:14,687 --> 0:14:16,272
-No story.
-Really?


200
0:14:16,272 --> 0:14:17,815
Yeah.


201
0:14:17,815 --> 0:14:22,611
He's an old buddy of mine.


202
0:14:22,611 --> 0:14:31,12
What?


203
0:14:31,12 --> 0:14:34,707
Your dad get mad at you
for coming home late last night?


204
0:14:34,707 --> 0:14:39,128
No. He's not really the type
that gets mad.


205
0:14:39,128 --> 0:14:42,923
What kind of guy is he then?


206
0:14:42,923 --> 0:14:45,509
Quiet one?


207
0:14:45,509 --> 0:14:49,346
-Could be worse, I guess.
-I guess.


208
0:14:49,346 --> 0:14:51,599
And your mom?


209
0:14:51,599 --> 0:14:54,685
Nope, just me and my dad.


210
0:14:54,685 --> 0:14:58,272
Did he raise you all by himself?


211
0:14:58,272 --> 0:15:0,816
Yeah.


212
0:15:0,816 --> 0:15:2,735
Why do you wanna know
about my dad?


213
0:15:2,735 --> 0:15:5,195
Just curious.


214
0:15:5,195 --> 0:15:13,12
Curious about
where you come from.


215
0:15:13,12 --> 0:15:15,623
I wanna meet your dad.


216
0:15:15,623 --> 0:15:22,338
Tonight.


217
0:15:22,338 --> 0:15:25,758
Look, you're-- You're not
gonna get very much out of him.


218
0:15:25,758 --> 0:15:32,14
So, l don't know,
just don't take it personaIly, okay?


219
0:15:32,14 --> 0:15:34,85
Hey, Pop.


220
0:15:34,85 --> 0:15:38,2
I got somebody I want you to meet.


221
0:15:38,2 --> 0:15:39,438
Hey.


222
0:15:39,438 --> 0:15:42,274
-This is Savannah.
-Hi.


223
0:15:42,274 --> 0:15:47,279
It's nice to meet you, Mr. Tyree.


224
0:15:47,279 --> 0:15:51,533
He-- This is my-- He collects coins.
He-- It's kind of like his big hobby.


225
0:15:51,533 --> 0:15:53,702
This is amazing.


226
0:15:53,702 --> 0:15:58,374
You have so many coins.
How did you get started in all this?


227
0:15:58,374 --> 0:16:1,335
Through John, actually.


228
0:16:1,335 --> 0:16:2,586
Not his thing anymore.


229
0:16:2,586 --> 0:16:6,548
-Hey, we shouId probably maybe go.
-What is this coin?


230
0:16:6,548 --> 0:16:10,302
That's a Sacagawean mule.


231
0:16:10,302 --> 0:16:15,474
It's actually....


232
0:16:15,474 --> 0:16:20,562
-Do you want to see some more?
-Absolutely, yes, if you don't mind.


233
0:16:20,562 --> 0:16:24,65
-Put this glove on then.
-Thanks.


234
0:16:24,65 --> 0:16:29,405
This is a humorous one.
This is a satirical coin.


235
0:16:29,405 --> 0:16:30,614
This is massive.


236
0:16:30,614 --> 0:16:33,534
Yeah, William Jennings BRYan,
when he ran for president...


237
0:16:33,534 --> 0:16:36,87
...he was-- He believed in--
No, don't turn it over.


238
0:16:36,87 --> 0:16:38,288
Leave it here.


239
0:16:38,288 --> 0:16:42,543
Do you remember that he had
the free silver policy. You remember.


240
0:16:42,543 --> 0:16:47,84
And McKinley was his opponent
and he's-- Wait, here.


241
0:16:47,84 --> 0:16:52,428
Now see, that's a real silver dollar.
That's the size of a silver dollar.


242
0:16:52,428 --> 0:16:56,432
And McKinley said that if
Bryan had his way...


243
0:16:56,432 --> 0:17:0,102
...then the silver dollars
would be that big. Yeah.


244
0:17:0,102 --> 0:17:2,271
-That's amazing.
-Can you imagine...


245
0:17:2,271 --> 0:17:4,94
...walking around with that
in your pocket?


246
0:17:4,94 --> 0:17:8,277
-That's really funny.
-That's humorous.


247
0:17:8,277 --> 0:17:10,863
Now, these--


248
0:17:10,863 --> 0:17:13,949
Pop, we can't do this right now.
We can't be here alI night.


249
0:17:13,949 --> 0:17:16,35
I have-- I have some to show you.


250
0:17:16,35 --> 0:17:17,786
This is fascinating.


251
0:17:17,786 --> 0:17:26,128
These are all matched in color.


252
0:17:26,128 --> 0:17:29,298
I had fun tonight.


253
0:17:29,298 --> 0:17:31,633
I like your dad.


254
0:17:31,633 --> 0:17:34,136
You shouIdn't be too hard on him.


255
0:17:34,136 --> 0:17:35,596
He loves you.


256
0:17:35,596 --> 0:17:43,854
I can tell even if you can't.


257
0:17:43,854 --> 0:17:47,149
Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.
Wait, Savannah. I mean....


258
0:17:47,149 --> 0:17:49,485
So l guess l'll see you soon, then?


259
0:17:49,485 --> 0:18:30,109
I'll see you soon, then.


260
0:18:30,109 --> 0:18:32,861
Where you been all day?


261
0:18:32,861 --> 0:18:36,31
-I've been busy.
-You're on spring break.


262
0:18:36,31 --> 0:18:38,7
You're supposed to be
lounging on the beach all day.


263
0:18:38,7 --> 0:18:42,246
You're not supposed to be busy
doing things.


264
0:18:42,246 --> 0:18:46,375
I want to show you something.


265
0:18:46,375 --> 0:18:50,838
The family that lived here, their home
was damaged by the hurricane.


266
0:18:50,838 --> 0:18:54,967
-What, so now you're rebuilding it?
-Yup. WelI, not just me.


267
0:18:54,967 --> 0:18:57,344
You're starting to make me
a littIe nervous.


268
0:18:57,344 --> 0:19:1,223
Why am I
starting to make you nervous?


269
0:19:1,223 --> 0:19:4,726
Because I'm starting to think you
might be too good of a person for me.


270
0:19:4,726 --> 0:19:6,979
No, I'm not that good of a person.


271
0:19:6,979 --> 0:19:12,151
You're sneaking off eveRY day to do
manual labor on a house for charity.


272
0:19:12,151 --> 0:19:15,237
-On your spring break.
-Yeah, you're right.


273
0:19:15,237 --> 0:19:19,867
It's selfish, reaIly,
me being this generous.


274
0:19:19,867 --> 0:19:24,663
-You don't drink, you don't smoke.
-Nope. Nope.


275
0:19:24,663 --> 0:19:29,126
-You probably don't sleep around.
-Absolutely not.


276
0:19:29,126 --> 0:19:31,86
Okay, look, you gotta have a fault.


277
0:19:31,86 --> 0:19:37,509
-I do.
-Okay, care to enlighten me?


278
0:19:37,509 --> 0:19:40,22
I curse.


279
0:19:40,22 --> 0:19:41,597
-No.
-I do.


280
0:19:41,597 --> 0:19:42,848
-No, you don't.
-I do.


281
0:19:42,848 --> 0:19:47,769
-I haven't heard you.
-Well, that's because it's in my mind.


282
0:19:47,769 --> 0:19:50,355
There's a never-ending stream
of curse words...


283
0:19:50,355 --> 0:19:52,107
...that l'm thinking at all times.


284
0:19:52,107 --> 0:19:54,443
Okay, fine, just say one then.


285
0:19:54,443 --> 0:19:56,612
No, I can't tell you because it's filthy.


286
0:19:56,612 --> 0:19:58,53
-Right.
-Yeah.


287
0:19:58,53 --> 0:20:0,782
Okay, aIl right. Fair enough.


288
0:20:0,782 --> 0:20:2,951
No, I have faults, John.


289
0:20:2,951 --> 0:20:6,955
Trust me, I have plenty of them.
You'll see.


290
0:20:6,955 --> 0:20:10,626
I hope so.


291
0:20:10,626 --> 0:20:13,86
We have to be finished
with this in three weeks.


292
0:20:13,86 --> 0:20:14,838
Hope that actually happens.


293
0:20:14,838 --> 0:20:17,132
These are to be the bedrooms,
parents' room...


294
0:20:17,132 --> 0:20:20,469
...the boys' rooms,
two boys, 7 and 9.


295
0:20:20,469 --> 0:20:22,512
Living room and the bathroom.


296
0:20:22,512 --> 0:20:24,89
And then this is the kitchen.


297
0:20:24,89 --> 0:20:27,768
This is the best room because
the mom's a really good cook.


298
0:20:27,768 --> 0:20:33,482
We're gonna make it really beautifuI
with white tile floors and tiles...


299
0:20:33,482 --> 0:20:37,527
...on the countertops
and there's gonna be a roof.


300
0:20:37,527 --> 0:20:42,95
-Here, John, come here.
-A roof would definitely be good.


301
0:20:42,95 --> 0:20:45,827
It's gonna be like this,
but it's gonna be everywhere.


302
0:20:45,827 --> 0:20:47,537
It's the only cover we have.


303
0:20:47,537 --> 0:20:51,583
Nice, we're gonna be here
for a while.


304
0:20:51,583 --> 0:20:54,294
Where'd you get your scar?


305
0:20:54,294 --> 0:20:59,466
That one?


306
0:20:59,466 --> 0:21:1,885
A knife fight.


307
0:21:1,885 --> 0:21:6,14
It was five years ago, we were really
drunk and the guy went for my eye.


308
0:21:6,14 --> 0:21:8,58
That's terrible.


309
0:21:8,58 --> 0:21:11,853
Why? He missed.


310
0:21:11,853 --> 0:21:16,817
The way people act around you, the
way they treated you at that restaurant.


311
0:21:16,817 --> 0:21:21,571
-It's like they're scared of you.
-They're not scared of me.


312
0:21:21,571 --> 0:21:23,615
They might be scared
of who I used to be.


313
0:21:23,615 --> 0:21:27,703
And who is that?


314
0:21:27,703 --> 0:21:29,705
Somebody different?


315
0:21:29,705 --> 0:21:33,709
So when did you change?
When you went into the Army?


316
0:21:33,709 --> 0:21:36,878
Yeah. Yeah, l mean, partly yeah.


317
0:21:36,878 --> 0:21:39,214
And the other part?


318
0:21:39,214 --> 0:21:43,802
I don't know,
I'm stiIl working on that.


319
0:21:43,802 --> 0:21:47,97
So you used to be tough.


320
0:21:47,97 --> 0:21:50,17
And maybe you stiIl are a little bit.


321
0:21:50,17 --> 0:21:55,22
-You don't scare me, John.
-No?


322
0:21:55,22 --> 0:24:4,985
Well, you scare me.


323
0:24:4,985 --> 0:24:17,205
Don't worry about him.


324
0:24:17,205 --> 0:24:28,884
John!


325
0:24:28,884 --> 0:24:36,57
What, you think you're safe
in there? Okay.


326
0:24:36,57 --> 0:25:4,419
No!


327
0:25:4,419 --> 0:25:35,659
It's all right.
Everybody understands.


328
0:25:35,659 --> 0:25:38,828
What are you doing over here?


329
0:25:38,828 --> 0:25:40,288
You're missing the party.


330
0:25:40,288 --> 0:25:43,833
The party's just managing fine
without me.


331
0:25:43,833 --> 0:25:46,628
What's wrong?


332
0:25:46,628 --> 0:25:49,923
Why are you all the way
over here by yourself?


333
0:25:49,923 --> 0:25:52,259
I'm dying, John.


334
0:25:52,259 --> 0:25:54,1
What?


335
0:25:54,1 --> 0:26:0,16
That's not even funny.


336
0:26:0,16 --> 0:26:2,477
I'm gonna miss you.


337
0:26:2,477 --> 0:26:4,354
It's almost over.


338
0:26:4,354 --> 0:26:5,981
No, it's not almost over.


339
0:26:5,981 --> 0:26:8,4
Yes, it is.


340
0:26:8,4 --> 0:26:11,57
I leave tomorrow.
I have to go back to schooI.


341
0:26:11,57 --> 0:26:12,821
-So?
-And you.


342
0:26:12,821 --> 0:26:17,242
No, and me nothing.
My commitment's up in 1 2 months.


343
0:26:17,242 --> 0:26:19,202
And then I'm back. For good.


344
0:26:19,202 --> 0:26:22,163
A lot could happen
in 1 2 months, John.


345
0:26:22,163 --> 0:26:25,458
You don't think I know that?


346
0:26:25,458 --> 0:26:28,3
I know that.


347
0:26:28,3 --> 0:26:34,134
And I'm not afraid at aIl.


348
0:26:34,134 --> 0:26:36,595
I promise you...


349
0:26:36,595 --> 0:26:40,682
...that it'll all be over
sooner than you think.


350
0:26:40,682 --> 0:26:44,269
Then l'll be back for good.


351
0:26:44,269 --> 0:26:49,107
You promise?


352
0:26:49,107 --> 0:27:11,88
I promise.


353
0:27:11,88 --> 0:27:16,176
I'm probably gonna be out of the Army
way before you're out of school.


354
0:27:16,176 --> 0:27:19,512
Am I gonna be in the audience
when you graduate?


355
0:27:19,512 --> 0:27:22,557
I think I might take
a littIe Ionger to graduate.


356
0:27:22,557 --> 0:27:27,62
Been spending so much time
around your dad...


357
0:27:27,62 --> 0:27:31,66
...and I think now
I want to teach special education.


358
0:27:31,66 --> 0:27:33,818
-You don't say.
-I don't know why it's taken me...


359
0:27:33,818 --> 0:27:39,74
...so long to realize. I mean,
I've Iived next to Alan my whole life--


360
0:27:39,74 --> 0:27:46,915
I'm sorry, back up. What does
that have to do with my dad?


361
0:27:46,915 --> 0:27:49,793
Well, there's....


362
0:27:49,793 --> 0:27:55,59
I mean, there's an explanation
for why he is the way he is.


363
0:27:55,59 --> 0:27:57,759
Forget it. Never mind.


364
0:27:57,759 --> 0:27:59,969
-No, no, no.
-No, let's go. Come here.


365
0:27:59,969 --> 0:28:7,6
What?
So, just, what were you saying?


366
0:28:7,6 --> 0:28:10,271
I grew up next to a kid with autism.


367
0:28:10,271 --> 0:28:12,607
-I have a frame of reference.
-Whoa, autistic?


368
0:28:12,607 --> 0:28:16,444
You saying my dad's like Alan?
You're saying my dad's retarded?


369
0:28:16,444 --> 0:28:19,948
No, Alan's not retarded, John.
He's autistic.


370
0:28:19,948 --> 0:28:22,951
There are milder forms of it
and these things go undiagnosed.


371
0:28:22,951 --> 0:28:26,663
Is this what you've been doing?
You've just been studying my dad?


372
0:28:26,663 --> 0:28:28,79
No. How could you even say that?


373
0:28:28,79 --> 0:28:32,252
I've Iived with my dad my entire life.
Put up with him my entire life.


374
0:28:32,252 --> 0:28:35,46
You think I don't know
that he's not normal?


375
0:28:35,46 --> 0:28:36,464
Yeah?


376
0:28:36,464 --> 0:28:42,178
You think I need you to teIl me
he's not normal?


377
0:28:42,178 --> 0:28:48,643
Yeah.


378
0:28:48,643 --> 0:28:51,855
Hey, soldier, leaving so soon, huh?


379
0:28:51,855 --> 0:28:55,275
Here, have a beer. It's on me.


380
0:28:55,275 --> 0:28:57,986
Come on, you should drink.
It'll make you feeI better.


381
0:28:57,986 --> 0:29:0,155
-Now's not a good time, all right?
-You sad?


382
0:29:0,155 --> 0:29:3,616
No, come on. You just need to reIax.
Come on. Just relax a little bit.


383
0:29:3,616 --> 0:29:5,493
What's going on with Savannah?


384
0:29:5,493 --> 0:29:7,662
-Just leave me alone.
-What's with Savannah?


385
0:29:7,662 --> 0:29:10,165
-How about you get your hands off?
-Come on.


386
0:29:10,165 --> 0:29:12,417
What is happening
with you and Savannah--?


387
0:29:12,417 --> 0:29:14,377
Hey, man, what are you doing?


388
0:29:14,377 --> 0:29:16,171
John!


389
0:29:16,171 --> 0:29:18,673
Oh, my-- Oh, my God!


390
0:29:18,673 --> 0:29:25,138
-John!
-Stop him. What is he doing?


391
0:29:25,138 --> 0:29:54,125
-HeIp him!
-Oh, I'm so sorry.


392
0:29:54,125 --> 0:29:56,753
I don't think she's home now.


393
0:29:56,753 --> 0:30:1,466
But she hasn't
gone back to school yet.


394
0:30:1,466 --> 0:30:10,58
She normally comes by and says
goodbye before she heads back, but....


395
0:30:10,58 --> 0:30:12,644
Oh, shit, Tim.


396
0:30:12,644 --> 0:30:14,521
Jesus, l'm sorRY, man.


397
0:30:14,521 --> 0:30:17,69
Hey, I like it.


398
0:30:17,69 --> 0:30:20,151
I think it makes me look
pretty tough.


399
0:30:20,151 --> 0:30:23,905
I just-- I had no idea
it was you back there.


400
0:30:23,905 --> 0:30:25,698
Hey, it was my fault.


401
0:30:25,698 --> 0:30:29,327
I don't know what I was thinking,
sneaking up behind a green beret.


402
0:30:29,327 --> 0:30:32,914
Hey, if you see her...


403
0:30:32,914 --> 0:30:34,874
...can you give her a message
for me?


404
0:30:34,874 --> 0:30:37,418
Yeah.


405
0:30:37,418 --> 0:30:41,381
Just teIl her I came by...


406
0:30:41,381 --> 0:30:43,91
...and that I....


407
0:30:43,91 --> 0:30:47,95
You wanna write it down?


408
0:30:47,95 --> 0:30:51,766
Yeah.


409
0:30:51,766 --> 0:30:54,185
I'll make sure she gets it.


410
0:30:54,185 --> 0:31:7,323
Thank you.


411
0:31:7,323 --> 0:31:10,159
Hey, Pop.


412
0:31:10,159 --> 0:31:13,371
I didn't know if anyone
else was coming so...


413
0:31:13,371 --> 0:31:34,934
...l made double.


414
0:31:34,934 --> 0:31:36,603
No, I'll do it.


415
0:31:36,603 --> 0:31:39,188
-I got it, Dad. lt's okay. l got it.
-No, I'll do it.


416
0:31:39,188 --> 0:31:43,359
-They're clean.
-I'lI do it. I'll do it.


417
0:31:43,359 --> 0:32:5,59
Okay.


418
0:32:5,59 --> 0:32:9,51
Looks like you're gonna have
leftovers for once.


419
0:32:9,51 --> 0:32:29,864
Oh, I'll have it next Sunday.


420
0:32:29,864 --> 0:32:38,456
Excuse me, Pop.


421
0:32:38,456 --> 0:32:41,668
Got your note.


422
0:32:41,668 --> 0:32:44,45
-Short, sweet, to the point.
-I'm sorry.


423
0:32:44,45 --> 0:32:46,89
John, I'm sorry.


424
0:32:46,89 --> 0:32:48,967
-I'm so sorry.
-No, I'm sorry.


425
0:32:48,967 --> 0:32:50,885
I didn't mean to make you feel that.


426
0:32:50,885 --> 0:32:54,555
I have no idea what I'm talking about.
No business pretending I'm a doctor.


427
0:32:54,555 --> 0:32:56,891
-I was watching him today.
-John.


428
0:32:56,891 --> 0:32:59,769
Please, I'm serious. I don't know
what I'm talking about.


429
0:32:59,769 --> 0:33:1,854
I really don't. It means nothing.


430
0:33:1,854 --> 0:33:4,899
Okay?


431
0:33:4,899 --> 0:33:6,901
I'm headed back to schooI.


432
0:33:6,901 --> 0:33:9,904
And I just wanted
to make sure that, you know....


433
0:33:9,904 --> 0:33:12,865
Make sure that what?


434
0:33:12,865 --> 0:33:16,77
I made you a promise, didn't I?


435
0:33:16,77 --> 0:33:20,164
Yeah.


436
0:33:20,164 --> 0:33:26,87
You wrote your first note
so l wrote mine.


437
0:33:26,87 --> 0:33:28,464
Don't read it now. Wait till I'm gone.


438
0:33:28,464 --> 0:33:30,967
Okay.


439
0:33:30,967 --> 0:33:34,929
-Hey, can you--? You hungry?
-Yes.


440
0:33:34,929 --> 0:33:39,1
Yeah? My dad made
a littIe extra for you.


441
0:33:39,1 --> 0:33:41,144
You know, it's Sunday.


442
0:33:41,144 --> 0:33:42,562
Okay.


443
0:33:42,562 --> 0:33:44,689
-I can only stay a little while.
-I know.


444
0:33:44,689 --> 0:33:50,82
Come on.


445
0:33:50,82 --> 0:33:53,573
Dear John...


446
0:33:53,573 --> 0:33:55,742
...two weeks together...


447
0:33:55,742 --> 0:34:0,288
...that's alI it took.


448
0:34:0,288 --> 0:34:16,971
Two weeks for me
to falL in love with you.


449
0:34:16,971 --> 0:34:20,475
Now we have one year apart.


450
0:34:20,475 --> 0:34:34,989
But what's one year apart
after two weeks like that together?


451
0:34:34,989 --> 0:34:36,657
-All right, Pop.
-Okay.


452
0:34:36,657 --> 0:34:38,826
I gotta go.


453
0:34:38,826 --> 0:34:41,329
-You be good, okay?
-Okay.


454
0:34:41,329 --> 0:34:43,831
So....


455
0:34:43,831 --> 0:34:56,302
-We're good. All right. See you later.
-Okay.


456
0:34:56,302 --> 0:34:58,429
You made me a promise.


457
0:34:58,429 --> 0:35:1,15
A promise L know you'Ll keep.


458
0:35:1,15 --> 0:35:6,354
So I onIy want one more promise from
you during this time we spend apart.


459
0:35:6,354 --> 0:35:9,232
TeLl me everything.


460
0:35:9,232 --> 0:35:12,36
Write it alI down, John.
ScribbIe it in a notebook.


461
0:35:12,36 --> 0:35:15,613
Type it out, e-maiL it to me...


462
0:35:15,613 --> 0:35:20,535
...I don't care,
but I wanna know everything.


463
0:35:20,535 --> 0:35:26,374
Then we'Ll be with each other alI the
time even if we're not with each other.


464
0:35:26,374 --> 0:35:41,389
That way before we know it,
I'Ll see you soon, then.


465
0:35:41,389 --> 0:35:43,57
-What's up, girls?
-Johnny!


466
0:35:43,57 --> 0:35:44,392
What up, man?


467
0:35:44,392 --> 0:35:46,144
-Hey, there he is.
-Look who it is.


468
0:35:46,144 --> 0:35:48,688
-Welcome back, John.
-Look at you.


469
0:35:48,688 --> 0:35:50,731
Welcome back.
Take a look at your voucher.


470
0:35:50,731 --> 0:35:53,442
All right.


471
0:35:53,442 --> 0:35:58,197
How was Atlantic City, man?


472
0:35:58,197 --> 0:36:1,576
No, laugh it up. That's great.
Yeah. That's the one thing I ask him.


473
0:36:1,576 --> 0:36:3,661
I didn't say.
First time l've seen him.


474
0:36:3,661 --> 0:36:6,33
-Wouldn't ask if you didn't know.
-How could he know?


475
0:36:6,33 --> 0:36:8,541
Don't even bother unpacking, guys.


476
0:36:8,541 --> 0:36:13,629
We move out bright and early.
Enjoy.


477
0:36:13,629 --> 0:36:23,97
Well, I'm excited.


478
0:36:23,97 --> 0:36:28,352
Dear Savannah, L promise.
I promise L'lL see you soon, then.


479
0:36:28,352 --> 0:36:30,605
I promise L'lI write all the time.


480
0:36:30,605 --> 0:36:36,152
I promise L'lL teLl you everything.


481
0:36:36,152 --> 0:36:41,574
Be patient with me, it may take a whiLe
for these Letters to get back to you.


482
0:36:41,574 --> 0:36:46,495
We've already been deployed
out on a mission.


483
0:36:46,495 --> 0:36:51,959
Come on, soldier, move it, move it.
Let's go!


484
0:36:51,959 --> 0:36:57,215
The problem is we can't exactly
use the local postaL system here.


485
0:36:57,215 --> 0:36:59,884
And there's no such thing
as Internet connection.


486
0:36:59,884 --> 0:37:3,179
So I have to send everything
from here out by airmail.


487
0:37:3,179 --> 0:37:5,765
-Can you get this out for me?
-Yeah. Yeah.


488
0:37:5,765 --> 0:37:11,479
-Don't lose it, all right?
-Yeah, I gotcha.


489
0:37:11,479 --> 0:37:16,67
Unfortunately, l'm not allowed to say
exactLy where here is.


490
0:37:16,67 --> 0:37:18,486
AlL l can teLl you is
where we've been sent...


491
0:37:18,486 --> 0:37:21,447
...makes me miss America
very much.


492
0:37:21,447 --> 0:37:54,981
And the lack of anything resembling
an ocean makes me miss Charleston.


493
0:37:54,981 --> 0:38:0,361
And everything around me
makes me miss you.


494
0:38:0,361 --> 0:38:4,865
We move around a Lot. so letters
tend to come late and out of order.


495
0:38:4,865 --> 0:38:6,951
We may want to number
our letters...


496
0:38:6,951 --> 0:38:10,538
...just so we know which order
we wrote them in.


497
0:38:10,538 --> 0:38:13,4
But when they do finaIly get here...


498
0:38:13,4 --> 0:38:16,21
...it's a good day.


499
0:38:16,21 --> 0:38:20,256
-Whenever they don't...
-All right, let's see here.


500
0:38:20,256 --> 0:38:23,467
Not for me. Not for me.


501
0:38:23,467 --> 0:38:27,471
Not for me. And not for me.


502
0:38:27,471 --> 0:38:28,723
Figures.


503
0:38:28,723 --> 0:38:30,85
-...it's not.
-Nothing for you either.


504
0:38:30,85 --> 0:38:42,903
But L know they'lL stiLl come.
I know it.


505
0:38:42,903 --> 0:38:48,326
That's right.


506
0:38:48,326 --> 0:38:50,244
Letter Number 8.


507
0:38:50,244 --> 0:38:54,54
Dear John, L'm back at my
parents' farm for the weekend.


508
0:38:54,54 --> 0:39:0,254
And they have some house guests
you may know.


509
0:39:0,254 --> 0:39:6,969
Savannah!


510
0:39:6,969 --> 0:39:9,43
I think that horse suits you just fine.


511
0:39:9,43 --> 0:39:15,561
I took Alan out riding with me today.
It was his first time on a horse.


512
0:39:15,561 --> 0:39:17,313
You Iook good on that horse, Alan.


513
0:39:17,313 --> 0:39:21,108
You've heard of horse sense, horses
are somehow abIe to sense danger?


514
0:39:21,108 --> 0:39:23,402
Sense out eviL?


515
0:39:23,402 --> 0:39:27,281
WeLl, l think autistic kids
have that too...


516
0:39:27,281 --> 0:39:29,283
...so L had this idea.


517
0:39:29,283 --> 0:39:32,203
This dream.


518
0:39:32,203 --> 0:39:35,122
I wanna open up
a summer camp for autistic kids.


519
0:39:35,122 --> 0:39:38,84
I've never seen him
act like this before.


520
0:39:38,84 --> 0:39:40,878
Are you hungry?


521
0:39:40,878 --> 0:39:43,464
Where they can ride horses
as much as they want.


522
0:39:43,464 --> 0:39:46,384
Are you hungry?


523
0:39:46,384 --> 0:39:51,472
For once in their life, a pIace where
they won't have to worry about a thing.


524
0:39:51,472 --> 0:39:54,308
What do you think?
Pipe dream, huh?


525
0:39:54,308 --> 0:39:56,394
No, it's not a pipe dream.


526
0:39:56,394 --> 0:40:0,815
It's a perfect dream.


527
0:40:0,815 --> 0:40:4,11
Erget. MerRY Christmas.


528
0:40:4,11 --> 0:40:7,405
John, to a Mr. John Tyree.


529
0:40:7,405 --> 0:40:8,656
-Shut up, man.
-Seven?


530
0:40:8,656 --> 0:40:11,325
-Stop moving around.
-Can I keep this one?


531
0:40:11,325 --> 0:40:13,744
Letter Number 33.


532
0:40:13,744 --> 0:40:18,165
Dear Savannah, the good news is
we've been sent somewhere new.


533
0:40:18,165 --> 0:40:21,85
Although L can't teLl you
where that is either.


534
0:40:21,85 --> 0:40:25,714
The bad news is, this pLace actualLy
makes me miss the old pIace.


535
0:40:25,714 --> 0:40:28,801
But it's a full moon here tonight,
which makes me think of you.


536
0:40:28,801 --> 0:40:33,18
Because l know that no matter what
I'm doing, no matter where l am...


537
0:40:33,18 --> 0:40:36,434
...this moon wiLl always be
the same size as yours.


538
0:40:36,434 --> 0:40:38,602
Half a world away.


539
0:40:38,602 --> 0:40:40,813
Dear John...


540
0:40:40,813 --> 0:40:44,108
...most nights I falI asleep
worrying about you.


541
0:40:44,108 --> 0:40:48,404
Wondering where
you may be out there.


542
0:40:48,404 --> 0:40:50,698
Not tonight.


543
0:40:50,698 --> 0:40:56,912
Tonight you're here with me.


544
0:40:56,912 --> 0:41:0,416
I visited your dad yesterday.


545
0:41:0,416 --> 0:41:4,712
Summer's aLmost over and I wanted to
see him before I went back to schooI.


546
0:41:4,712 --> 0:41:5,963
I hope that's okay.


547
0:41:5,963 --> 0:41:7,339
Hey.


548
0:41:7,339 --> 0:41:9,133
I made you a pie.


549
0:41:9,133 --> 0:41:13,53
He made me dinner.
It was Sunday so we had lasagna.


550
0:41:13,53 --> 0:41:17,808
And L got him talking about his coins.
So we had plenty of conversation.


551
0:41:17,808 --> 0:41:22,104
This one is kind of a cull,
a coin that's in really bad shape.


552
0:41:22,104 --> 0:41:25,774
-WorthIess to most collectors.
-But not to you.


553
0:41:25,774 --> 0:41:27,61
No, not to me.


554
0:41:27,61 --> 0:41:30,279
What is your favorite coin?


555
0:41:30,279 --> 0:41:35,284
Out of aIl the coins that you have,
what is your absolute favorite coin?


556
0:41:35,284 --> 0:41:46,921
Do you have one?


557
0:41:46,921 --> 0:41:50,424
'Seventy-eight Jefferson mule.


558
0:41:50,424 --> 0:41:52,76
That'd be my favorite.


559
0:41:52,76 --> 0:41:55,95
Definitely.


560
0:41:55,95 --> 0:41:58,849
Why? Is it worth the most?


561
0:41:58,849 --> 0:42:1,644
Well, it's worth a lot, not the most.


562
0:42:1,644 --> 0:42:4,23
But, you know....


563
0:42:4,23 --> 0:42:12,112
What's the stoRY behind it?


564
0:42:12,112 --> 0:42:13,28
Here's one....


565
0:42:13,28 --> 0:42:22,623
So I'll ask you instead, John,
wherever you may be.


566
0:42:22,623 --> 0:42:28,963
Dear Savannah, only because
I promised to telL you everything.


567
0:42:28,963 --> 0:42:30,798
Thank you.


568
0:42:30,798 --> 0:42:35,886
When L was 7 years old,
I bought an ice cream cone.


569
0:42:35,886 --> 0:42:53,32
On the way home, L noticed one of
the pennies wasn't actuaLly a penny.


570
0:42:53,32 --> 0:42:56,824
I don't know.


571
0:42:56,824 --> 0:43:1,328
I don't know.
Never seen anything like it.


572
0:43:1,328 --> 0:43:4,54
Did you find this, son?


573
0:43:4,54 --> 0:43:6,667
Yeah?


574
0:43:6,667 --> 0:43:9,503
No, it's a mule.


575
0:43:9,503 --> 0:43:13,48
-It's a what?
-A mule. An error coin.


576
0:43:13,48 --> 0:43:15,5
Every now and then
they make mistakes...


577
0:43:15,5 --> 0:43:17,928
...batch accidentaIly slips through,
this thing...


578
0:43:17,928 --> 0:43:22,891
...head's a nickel, tail's a penny. Mule.
Really more of a novelty than anything.


579
0:43:22,891 --> 0:43:25,561
Remember the horse sense
you were taIking about?


580
0:43:25,561 --> 0:43:27,771
--the kid found it
I wilI buy it anyway.


581
0:43:27,771 --> 0:43:32,67
Twenty bucks.


582
0:43:32,67 --> 0:43:34,778
-No, thank you.
-WeLl, my dad has it too.


583
0:43:34,778 --> 0:43:37,114
Now, wait a minute. Hang on.


584
0:43:37,114 --> 0:43:42,786
Let me take another look
at that real quick.


585
0:43:42,786 --> 0:43:44,455
John, let's go.


586
0:43:44,455 --> 0:43:46,832
I'll be damned.


587
0:43:46,832 --> 0:43:58,52
-Do you know what this is?
-No.


588
0:43:58,52 --> 0:43:59,887
Look at that.


589
0:43:59,887 --> 0:44:1,388
That's your coin.


590
0:44:1,388 --> 0:44:3,57
You want my advice?


591
0:44:3,57 --> 0:44:4,892
Dad to Dad?


592
0:44:4,892 --> 0:44:6,393
Keep it.


593
0:44:6,393 --> 0:44:9,313
Hold on to it.
Pass it down to your son.


594
0:44:9,313 --> 0:44:12,399
Let him pass it to his son
and on and on, I'll tell you what...


595
0:44:12,399 --> 0:44:16,945
...30, 40, a hundred years
from now...


596
0:44:16,945 --> 0:44:20,24
...you're gonna have something
worth a whole lot more than $4000.


597
0:44:20,24 --> 0:44:23,619
I promise you.


598
0:44:23,619 --> 0:44:25,245
Hey.


599
0:44:25,245 --> 0:44:29,583
Do you want to keep it?


600
0:44:29,583 --> 0:44:33,17
-Good for you.
-Thank you. Thank you.


601
0:44:33,17 --> 0:44:36,9
At first L Loved chasing after
those muIes with my father.


602
0:44:36,9 --> 0:44:38,592
We finalLy had something
to talk about.


603
0:44:38,592 --> 0:44:41,845
You know, something
we couLd do together.


604
0:44:41,845 --> 0:44:45,849
But he became obsessed with them.
You know how he is.


605
0:44:45,849 --> 0:44:49,436
And then l became a teenager
and you know how L am.


606
0:44:49,436 --> 0:44:52,69
All the way up to Wooster
for another coin show. I'm just--


607
0:44:52,69 --> 0:44:54,9
No, I'm not doing that.


608
0:44:54,9 --> 0:44:58,612
You're going to one
eveRY weekend now.


609
0:44:58,612 --> 0:45:2,366
Oh, that's good.
I love warm milk. That's nice.


610
0:45:2,366 --> 0:45:14,211
You spend all of our money on coins.
Get a fricking fridge that works.


611
0:45:14,211 --> 0:45:19,258
EventuaLly he stopped talking
about coins with me altogether.


612
0:45:19,258 --> 0:45:20,634
And when that happened...


613
0:45:20,634 --> 0:45:29,935
...we found there wasn't all that much
left to talk about.


614
0:45:29,935 --> 0:45:34,106
So that's the story.


615
0:45:34,106 --> 0:45:38,11
I miss you so much it hurts.


616
0:45:38,11 --> 0:45:40,863
Sorry, sorry.


617
0:45:40,863 --> 0:45:43,782
Oh, my God.
My brother was in the towers.


618
0:45:43,782 --> 0:45:52,458
-I love you too, babe.
-Please call me as soon as you can.


619
0:45:52,458 --> 0:46:32,581
-Susan. Susan, is my dad there?
-Just calm down.


620
0:46:32,581 --> 0:46:34,541
All right, fellas, here's the deal.


621
0:46:34,541 --> 0:46:37,2
Requesting permission
to extend my tour, sir.


622
0:46:37,2 --> 0:46:39,46
Requesting permission
to extend, sir.


623
0:46:39,46 --> 0:46:41,465
Requesting permission
to extend as well, sir.


624
0:46:41,465 --> 0:46:43,342
Requesting permission
to extend, sir.


625
0:46:43,342 --> 0:46:45,803
Requesting permission
to extend as well, sir.


626
0:46:45,803 --> 0:46:49,89
Okay, guys, listen. We're gonna get
our orders from Operations on Monday.


627
0:46:49,89 --> 0:46:53,894
Before we do anything rash, let's take
the weekend to mulI this over, alI right?


628
0:46:53,894 --> 0:46:56,104
I got a wife and kids to think about.


629
0:46:56,104 --> 0:46:58,941
Nobody's asking you
to stay on too, captain.


630
0:46:58,941 --> 0:47:1,193
Yeah, you are. This is my team.


631
0:47:1,193 --> 0:47:2,82
Where you go, I go.


632
0:47:2,82 --> 0:47:5,364
Where we go, we aIl go.


633
0:47:5,364 --> 0:47:8,909
If everyone stilI wants to extend
on Monday, then we'll do it.


634
0:47:8,909 --> 0:47:14,164
Together.


635
0:47:14,164 --> 0:47:15,999
Don't get into trouble over there.


636
0:47:15,999 --> 0:47:18,85
-Take care of yourself.
-Always.


637
0:47:18,85 --> 0:47:20,838
Let's go, man.
The plane to Paris leaves in an hour.


638
0:47:20,838 --> 0:47:22,589
You ready? Are you ready?


639
0:47:22,589 --> 0:47:24,466
-It's gonna be amazing.
-I can't go.


640
0:47:24,466 --> 0:47:26,9
What? Of course you're going.


641
0:47:26,9 --> 0:47:27,427
I gotta go to Charleston.


642
0:47:27,427 --> 0:47:29,388
-You're going to Charleston?
-Yup.


643
0:47:29,388 --> 0:47:31,765
What are you, nuts?
We got two days off, man.


644
0:47:31,765 --> 0:47:35,102
By the time you fly there and back,
you're gonna have like 1 8 hours.


645
0:47:35,102 --> 0:47:38,272
It's 1 8 more than I had this morning.


646
0:47:38,272 --> 0:47:40,566
I don't know when
I'll get that again...


647
0:47:40,566 --> 0:47:42,317
...so I gotta go.


648
0:47:42,317 --> 0:47:44,236
Nothing I can say
to change your mind?


649
0:47:44,236 --> 0:47:54,663
Nope.


650
0:47:54,663 --> 0:47:58,25
John!


651
0:47:58,25 --> 0:48:37,8
John. John.


652
0:48:37,8 --> 0:48:42,336
You sure he--? He actualIy said that?
He wants to come?


653
0:48:42,336 --> 0:48:44,171
I think he will.


654
0:48:44,171 --> 0:48:48,342
-He wasn't so sure about it, but....
-Yeah, I'll bet he wasn't.


655
0:48:48,342 --> 0:48:50,385
--has asked President Bush
to activate...


656
0:48:50,385 --> 0:48:56,224
...thousands of miIitary reservists.


657
0:48:56,224 --> 0:49:0,27
Hey, Pop!


658
0:49:0,27 --> 0:49:2,564
Hey, what are you doing in here?


659
0:49:2,564 --> 0:49:5,25
Look at you.


660
0:49:5,25 --> 0:49:6,485
Spiffy.


661
0:49:6,485 --> 0:49:8,195
Are you coming with us?


662
0:49:8,195 --> 0:49:12,824
Please. My parents are so excited
to meet you, Mr. Tyree.


663
0:49:12,824 --> 0:49:16,119
Yeah.


664
0:49:16,119 --> 0:49:18,538
You hungry?


665
0:49:18,538 --> 0:49:21,166
I made meatloaf.


666
0:49:21,166 --> 0:49:23,669
I know you made meatloaf, Pop.
It's Saturday.


667
0:49:23,669 --> 0:49:25,462
We can take it with us.


668
0:49:25,462 --> 0:49:28,215
We can take it with us.
You mind if we take it with us?


669
0:49:28,215 --> 0:49:30,676
Well, I don't....


670
0:49:30,676 --> 0:49:46,149
Is that okay? I'll wrap it up.


671
0:49:46,149 --> 0:49:49,444
I don't mean-- I'm sorry, but could--?


672
0:49:49,444 --> 0:49:52,197
Could you stop the car,
because I need to go back.


673
0:49:52,197 --> 0:49:55,242
-Should I turn around?
-Stop the car, please. Stop the car.


674
0:49:55,242 --> 0:49:56,493
-Forget something?
-Okay.


675
0:49:56,493 --> 0:49:58,829
No, I need to get out
of the car. Please.


676
0:49:58,829 --> 0:50:1,498
-All right, just-- Just relax, okay?
-Yeah.


677
0:50:1,498 --> 0:50:3,5
I don't think I can do this.


678
0:50:3,5 --> 0:50:8,422
-Look, you're fine. You're fine.
-No, I just-- Please. I need to get out.


679
0:50:8,422 --> 0:50:10,465
You're okay, Pop. It's fine.


680
0:50:10,465 --> 0:50:13,343
-Look, stop the car, I can't--
-Okay, I'll turn around.


681
0:50:13,343 --> 0:50:15,595
We're fine, we're fine, we're fine.


682
0:50:15,595 --> 0:50:20,17
-I gotta get out. Stop the car.
-Okay, all right.


683
0:50:20,17 --> 0:50:21,81
-Come on, Dad, stop!
-Okay.


684
0:50:21,81 --> 0:50:32,571
Pop. Come on, don't do that.


685
0:50:32,571 --> 0:50:34,781
Hey, Mr. Tyree.


686
0:50:34,781 --> 0:50:36,575
Hey, you all right?


687
0:50:36,575 --> 0:50:37,993
-You okay?
-I'm sorry.


688
0:50:37,993 --> 0:50:39,786
It's okay.


689
0:50:39,786 --> 0:50:44,207
But hey, let's....


690
0:50:44,207 --> 0:50:55,177
We're gonna wait for you
in the car, all right?


691
0:50:55,177 --> 0:50:57,971
-No, I'm fine, I'm fine.
-No, don't, honestly,


692
0:50:57,971 --> 0:51:0,265
We can stay. Let's just stay.


693
0:51:0,265 --> 0:51:5,645
Okay? Let's stay,
because I can go next year.


694
0:51:5,645 --> 0:51:9,316
Pop, I only got one night.


695
0:51:9,316 --> 0:51:12,486
I mean, l gotta go back.
Do you understand that?


696
0:51:12,486 --> 0:51:23,497
You shouId go. You both should go.


697
0:51:23,497 --> 0:51:28,1
New York Mayor RudoIph Giuliani said
WaLl street wiIl re-open on Monday.


698
0:51:28,1 --> 0:51:41,723
He tried. At least he tried.


699
0:51:41,723 --> 0:51:46,978
Hello, welcome.


700
0:51:46,978 --> 0:51:50,315
My girl.


701
0:51:50,315 --> 0:51:51,858
Mom, this is John.


702
0:51:51,858 --> 0:51:56,863
John, I feel like I already know you.
Where's your father, did he come too?


703
0:51:56,863 --> 0:51:58,865
-No, ma'am.
-Oh, that's okay.


704
0:51:58,865 --> 0:52:2,369
I'm just glad
that you made it home safe.


705
0:52:2,369 --> 0:52:5,372
We thought about canceling
with everything that's going on...


706
0:52:5,372 --> 0:52:8,208
...but we felt like
eveRYbody should be together.


707
0:52:8,208 --> 0:52:10,919
I've been briefing him in the car
and l think he's good.


708
0:52:10,919 --> 0:52:15,632
It was good intel. With solid tactical
training, I'm as ready as I'll ever be.


709
0:52:15,632 --> 0:52:17,884
I love him already.


710
0:52:17,884 --> 0:52:19,719
Mrs. Curtis, Savannah.


711
0:52:19,719 --> 0:52:21,429
-Hey, dude, how's it going?
-John.


712
0:52:21,429 --> 0:52:25,392
It's good to see you again.


713
0:52:25,392 --> 0:52:29,62
All right, You know what?
You Iook like you could use a drink.


714
0:52:29,62 --> 0:52:32,732
-I'lI grab one for you.
-Yes, thank you.


715
0:52:32,732 --> 0:52:34,568
-John.
-What's he doing here?


716
0:52:34,568 --> 0:52:38,697
He's here because I invited him.
His famiIy lives just up the street.


717
0:52:38,697 --> 0:52:40,907
What are you, Iike,
hanging out now?


718
0:52:40,907 --> 0:52:46,913
He's reaIly not that bad once you get
to know him, I swear to you, John.


719
0:52:46,913 --> 0:52:49,374
Here you go.


720
0:52:49,374 --> 0:52:51,334
It's bourbon, it's not gonna kill you.


721
0:52:51,334 --> 0:52:56,339
Be right back.


722
0:52:56,339 --> 0:53:0,218
We got off on the wrong foot and l want
to apologize for the way I treated you.


723
0:53:0,218 --> 0:53:4,514
If l had known that Savannah
was actually gonna stay with you...


724
0:53:4,514 --> 0:53:11,146
...l wouldn't have treated you that way.
In all seriousness, I'm sorry.


725
0:53:11,146 --> 0:53:12,355
Fair enough.


726
0:53:12,355 --> 0:53:15,275
If you need anything and....


727
0:53:15,275 --> 0:53:18,32
-Enjoy yourself.
-Right.


728
0:53:18,32 --> 0:53:20,363
So this is him.


729
0:53:20,363 --> 0:53:23,158
Yup. No tough-guy routine
from you, Dad.


730
0:53:23,158 --> 0:53:26,244
Routine?
I bench press refrigerators, honey.


731
0:53:26,244 --> 0:53:28,496
Your boyfriends
need to know these things.


732
0:53:28,496 --> 0:53:31,374
He's absolutely right.
Nice to meet you, Mr. Curtis.


733
0:53:31,374 --> 0:53:34,669
But l think Tim here might have
already beat you to the punch.


734
0:53:34,669 --> 0:53:36,963
He said he'd rough me up
if ever I hurt her.


735
0:53:36,963 --> 0:53:39,966
I was very convincing too.
I think I made quite an impact.


736
0:53:39,966 --> 0:53:42,636
Well, cheers, son.
Glad you could join us.


737
0:53:42,636 --> 0:53:43,97
Thank you, sir.


738
0:53:43,97 --> 0:53:49,768
-Billy! You actually showed up!
-See, hard part's over.


739
0:53:49,768 --> 0:53:52,938
-Good to see you again, John.
-How you doing, Tim?


740
0:53:52,938 --> 0:53:55,649
Hi. Hey, Tim, how are you doing?


741
0:53:55,649 --> 0:53:58,485
-Good.
-I haven't seen your wife. Is she here?


742
0:53:58,485 --> 0:54:1,488
Yeah, she's on vacation actually.


743
0:54:1,488 --> 0:54:4,199
-So I'll tell her you said hello.
-Please do.


744
0:54:4,199 --> 0:54:6,66
I wilI.


745
0:54:6,66 --> 0:54:12,4
Alan, remember
what we talked about?


746
0:54:12,4 --> 0:54:14,584
Another vacation?


747
0:54:14,584 --> 0:54:18,505
Yeah.


748
0:54:18,505 --> 0:54:21,967
Alan ever ask about her?


749
0:54:21,967 --> 0:54:25,512
Yeah, he does.
I just don't know what to say.


750
0:54:25,512 --> 0:54:31,226
Hey, look, I'm not a father.


751
0:54:31,226 --> 0:54:36,22
You know, I'm really in no position
to give you advice at all.


752
0:54:36,22 --> 0:54:38,275
When I was a kid,
I waited around every day...


753
0:54:38,275 --> 0:54:40,652
...hoping that today
would finaIly be the day...


754
0:54:40,652 --> 0:54:44,614
...that my mom would come home.


755
0:54:44,614 --> 0:54:46,95
I waited around 1 5 years.


756
0:54:46,95 --> 0:54:51,162
So l know how painful
it might have been for my dad to...


757
0:54:51,162 --> 0:54:54,749
...just teIl me the truth.


758
0:54:54,749 --> 0:54:57,294
It would have saved me
a lot of waiting around.


759
0:54:57,294 --> 0:55:1,506
You know?


760
0:55:1,506 --> 0:55:5,51
Well, I guess if the worst thing
you can say about your father...


761
0:55:5,51 --> 0:55:9,347
...is he tried to protect you
too much then...


762
0:55:9,347 --> 0:55:12,392
...that's a pretty good father, isn't it?


763
0:55:12,392 --> 0:55:16,62
I'm sorry.
You're John, right? Savannah's John?


764
0:55:16,62 --> 0:55:18,69
-Yes, sir.
-I wanna thank you for what you do.


765
0:55:18,69 --> 0:55:21,484
Know our prayers are with you.
I hope whatever happens...


766
0:55:21,484 --> 0:55:24,738
...it'lI be over soon. So you boys
can come home safe and sound.


767
0:55:24,738 --> 0:55:27,157
Oh, it won't be over anytime soon.


768
0:55:27,157 --> 0:55:30,16
Afghanistan will just be the first stop
of many.


769
0:55:30,16 --> 0:55:34,247
He's right, you know. Pretty soon they'Il
ask y'all to reenlist for another tour.


770
0:55:34,247 --> 0:55:37,25
Slowly but surely they'll
stop asking and start telling.


771
0:55:37,25 --> 0:55:39,669
None of the soldiers I know
need to be asked, sir.


772
0:55:39,669 --> 0:55:42,297
And we sure don't need to be told.


773
0:55:42,297 --> 0:55:52,974
What do you mean by we?


774
0:55:52,974 --> 0:55:56,311
It was great to see you guys.
See you next year.


775
0:55:56,311 --> 0:56:4,444
Savannah....


776
0:56:4,444 --> 0:56:9,616
So you're gonna reenlist,
just like that?


777
0:56:9,616 --> 0:56:12,619
It's something we shouId talk about.


778
0:56:12,619 --> 0:56:21,795
Two more years, John.


779
0:56:21,795 --> 0:56:25,882
Have you already done it?
Have you already re-upped?


780
0:56:25,882 --> 0:56:27,675
No.


781
0:56:27,675 --> 0:56:33,807
But you decided
that you're going to?


782
0:56:33,807 --> 0:56:35,934
Do I have a say?


783
0:56:35,934 --> 0:56:38,645
Do I have a say in this?


784
0:56:38,645 --> 0:57:3,711
-You don't understand.
-Don't ever tell me I don't understand.


785
0:57:3,711 --> 0:57:10,468
Leave me alone, John.


786
0:57:10,468 --> 0:57:14,18
Please.


787
0:57:14,18 --> 0:57:17,16
What do you...?


788
0:57:17,16 --> 0:57:18,977
What do you want from me?


789
0:57:18,977 --> 0:57:22,772
Savannah, I mean....


790
0:57:22,772 --> 0:57:26,943
Just teIl me what you want from me.
I mean, you want me to quit?


791
0:57:26,943 --> 0:57:29,487
Is that it?


792
0:57:29,487 --> 0:57:33,908
Look, I don't know how we got here.
I don't know what happened.


793
0:57:33,908 --> 0:57:36,494
Just woke up and...


794
0:57:36,494 --> 0:57:39,8
...there's buildings falling and....


795
0:57:39,8 --> 0:57:42,834
I mean, l had a plan--
I had a plan, but now l don't.


796
0:57:42,834 --> 0:57:46,212
And I have no idea what to do.


797
0:57:46,212 --> 0:57:49,716
I don't know what to do and l just--
All I know is I wanna stay here.


798
0:57:49,716 --> 0:57:53,136
I just wanna stay right here with you
as long as l possibly can.


799
0:57:53,136 --> 0:57:56,556
You're just all that matters, okay?
You're all that matters to me.


800
0:57:56,556 --> 0:57:59,851
I'm trying to figure out what
the right thing is and I don't know.


801
0:57:59,851 --> 0:58:4,147
I don't have any idea how to get there.
I just-- Because I need you to tell me.


802
0:58:4,147 --> 0:58:6,983
I just need you to tell me, okay?


803
0:58:6,983 --> 0:58:20,914
Can you just tell me, please--?
Just teIl me what you want me to do.


804
0:58:20,914 --> 1:0:52,231
I want you to come with me.


805
1:0:52,231 --> 1:1:1,74
Hey, Pop.


806
1:1:1,74 --> 1:1:3,117
Thank you. Thank you for coming.


807
1:1:3,117 --> 1:1:9,916
Well....


808
1:1:9,916 --> 1:1:13,753
So you think you're gonna be
okay by yourself this time?


809
1:1:13,753 --> 1:1:22,679
Yeah, why wouldn't I be?


810
1:1:22,679 --> 1:1:27,58
I should probably be getting going.


811
1:1:27,58 --> 1:1:53,42
Take care of yourself.


812
1:1:53,42 --> 1:1:56,17
So are we...?
I mean, we're okay though.


813
1:1:56,17 --> 1:2:8,99
Right? Nothing has changed?


814
1:2:8,99 --> 1:2:11,894
Be careful not to step
in any fires, okay?


815
1:2:11,894 --> 1:2:17,358
Okay. l will.


816
1:2:17,358 --> 1:2:19,444
So l'Il see you soon, then.


817
1:2:19,444 --> 1:2:54,979
I'll see you soon, then.


818
1:2:54,979 --> 1:2:57,356
Welcome back, guys.


819
1:2:57,356 --> 1:3:0,276
Hope you had a good weekend.
Wish it could've been longer...


820
1:3:0,276 --> 1:3:4,822
...but sometimes you got
to take what you can get.


821
1:3:4,822 --> 1:3:15,708
So that's it then?


822
1:3:15,708 --> 1:3:19,67
It's unanimous?


823
1:3:19,67 --> 1:3:21,714
Okay.


824
1:3:21,714 --> 1:4:17,395
I'll start the paperwork.


825
1:4:17,395 --> 1:4:18,813
Thank you, sir.


826
1:4:18,813 --> 1:4:22,9
O'Neill, here you go!


827
1:4:22,9 --> 1:4:24,944
This smells pretty good, Russ.


828
1:4:24,944 --> 1:4:50,52
And we got Daniels. Where's he at?


829
1:4:50,52 --> 1:5:40,269
Move, move, move, up and shoot!


830
1:5:40,269 --> 1:6:27,608
-Hey, yo.
-Yeah, nothing today, man. Sorry.


831
1:6:27,608 --> 1:6:33,364
Go, go, go.


832
1:6:33,364 --> 1:6:38,35
Yo, you guys seen John?
Is he back here?


833
1:6:38,35 --> 1:6:40,997
Yo, John.


834
1:6:40,997 --> 1:6:42,915
Got one for you, dude.


835
1:6:42,915 --> 1:6:55,803
-Yeah?
-That's it, though.


836
1:6:55,803 --> 1:7:2,435
Dear John, l know it's been
way too long since L last wrote you.


837
1:7:2,435 --> 1:7:6,772
I've been staring at this blank page
for the last two hours.


838
1:7:6,772 --> 1:7:9,316
WeLl, if l'm being honest...


839
1:7:9,316 --> 1:7:13,612
...I've been staring at it
for the last two months.


840
1:7:13,612 --> 1:7:18,2
Please forgive me
for what l'm about to say.


841
1:7:18,2 --> 1:7:25,291
And know that this is
the hardest thing I've ever had to do.


842
1:7:25,291 --> 1:7:28,461
My life without you has no meaning.


843
1:7:28,461 --> 1:7:33,966
And L cannot Live.... L'm sorry.


844
1:7:33,966 --> 1:7:39,221
Yo, listen to this, hedge fund manager
on Wall Street, right?


845
1:7:39,221 --> 1:7:43,976
How much do you think he made
at his regular job?


846
1:7:43,976 --> 1:7:49,565
Twenty-seven million dollars, he ran
a hedge fund. Works on WaIl Street.


847
1:7:49,565 --> 1:8:13,631
That is amazing.


848
1:8:13,631 --> 1:8:25,17
You making mud pies, buddy?


849
1:8:25,17 --> 1:8:33,609
What's going on, man?


850
1:8:33,609 --> 1:8:36,362
You wanna talk about it?


851
1:8:36,362 --> 1:8:42,868
Nothing to talk about.


852
1:8:42,868 --> 1:8:49,625
She found somebody else.


853
1:8:49,625 --> 1:8:52,837
You got any idea who it is?


854
1:8:52,837 --> 1:8:55,339
No, she didn't say.


855
1:8:55,339 --> 1:9:1,387
I mean, l got a pretty good idea.


856
1:9:1,387 --> 1:9:3,764
Look, man...


857
1:9:3,764 --> 1:9:6,725
...you know, this happens, dude.
I mean, you'll get her back.


858
1:9:6,725 --> 1:9:8,561
You get home, she comes running.


859
1:9:8,561 --> 1:9:14,191
-It's the whole cycle, dude.
-They already got engaged.


860
1:9:14,191 --> 1:9:17,194
Jesus.


861
1:9:17,194 --> 1:9:20,239
Hey, I'm sorry, man.


862
1:9:20,239 --> 1:9:37,756
Let me know if I can do anything,
all right?


863
1:9:37,756 --> 1:9:42,261
--off the bottom rim. You wouldn't think
a squirrel could swim, but I swear...


864
1:9:42,261 --> 1:9:45,139
...swam 20 yards to the shoreline.


865
1:9:45,139 --> 1:9:47,433
-Swimming squirreI.
-That's crazy, dude.


866
1:9:47,433 --> 1:9:50,186
Hey, notice that. Did y'all see that?


867
1:9:50,186 --> 1:9:52,938
I mean, that's as sexy as it gets
around here.


868
1:9:52,938 --> 1:9:56,442
They can't show their legs,
so they got fishnets on their faces.


869
1:9:56,442 --> 1:10:0,487
I'm gonna bring that back to the States
and make my girl wear that.


870
1:10:0,487 --> 1:10:13,959
How mysterious.


871
1:10:13,959 --> 1:10:15,878
Back up, back up!


872
1:10:15,878 --> 1:10:18,214
-What's he saying?
-Hey, he's speaking Turkish.


873
1:10:18,214 --> 1:10:20,966
-What is he saying, though?
-I don't know. I don't know.


874
1:10:20,966 --> 1:10:22,968
Come on, specialist, figure it out!


875
1:10:22,968 --> 1:10:26,805
Look, man, I speak Pashtu,
I speak Farsi, I speak all kinds of shit.


876
1:10:26,805 --> 1:10:28,682
What languages you speak?
Come here.


877
1:10:28,682 --> 1:10:30,976
-Good work, man.
-Stay right there.


878
1:10:30,976 --> 1:10:34,813
-Hey, where are you going?
-Somebody's gotta figure it out.


879
1:10:34,813 --> 1:10:36,482
-Noodles, go with him.
-Yeah.


880
1:10:36,482 --> 1:10:38,776
Back up, back up.


881
1:10:38,776 --> 1:10:41,487
Tyree!


882
1:10:41,487 --> 1:10:43,948
Wait for further instructions.


883
1:10:43,948 --> 1:10:53,999
Let's move out.


884
1:10:53,999 --> 1:11:2,925
-Good?
-Yeah, you?


885
1:11:2,925 --> 1:11:6,428
We got a man down! Noodles, you
gonna be all right, man! Hold on, man!


886
1:11:6,428 --> 1:11:11,684
Copy that, man down! Man down!


887
1:11:11,684 --> 1:11:13,269
-Come here.
-You see it?


888
1:11:13,269 --> 1:11:15,2
I got you. Get your hands up!


889
1:11:15,2 --> 1:11:17,189
Tyree, do you read?
TaLk to me, Tyree.


890
1:11:17,189 --> 1:11:18,857
Lucky SOB. It hit your plate.


891
1:11:18,857 --> 1:11:29,201
Jesus, l never loved a piece of clothing
more in my entire life, I swear to God.


892
1:11:29,201 --> 1:11:33,38
John!


893
1:11:33,38 --> 1:11:34,873
Man down! Medic!


894
1:11:34,873 --> 1:11:37,42
Medic! John.


895
1:11:37,42 --> 1:11:38,419
Come on, man.


896
1:11:38,419 --> 1:11:40,546
Medic!


897
1:11:40,546 --> 1:11:43,632
Look, come on, you're gonna
be fine, all right? It's nothing.


898
1:11:43,632 --> 1:11:46,302
It's nothing. You got this.


899
1:11:46,302 --> 1:11:52,725
Stay awake, okay? You just look
in my eyes, just look in my eyes!


900
1:11:52,725 --> 1:11:56,312
Keep your eyes open, okay?


901
1:11:56,312 --> 1:12:0,607
Eyes, awake, awake,
right at me, okay?


902
1:12:0,607 --> 1:12:21,712
Jakes!


903
1:12:21,712 --> 1:12:24,34
Welcome back, Sergeant Tyree.


904
1:12:24,34 --> 1:12:27,551
Rest easy, okay?
You're in the hospital in Germany.


905
1:12:27,551 --> 1:13:33,242
And you're gonna be just fine.


906
1:13:33,242 --> 1:13:34,493
Tyree.


907
1:13:34,493 --> 1:13:37,496
-You look good, man.
-Thank you, sir.


908
1:13:37,496 --> 1:13:41,75
I just wanted to come by
and let you know l'Il be extending.


909
1:13:41,75 --> 1:13:44,837
Extending.
Tyree, it's been three months.


910
1:13:44,837 --> 1:13:46,964
I'm impressed, but I'm not stupid.


911
1:13:46,964 --> 1:13:49,967
Go home, John. Get some R&R.


912
1:13:49,967 --> 1:13:55,139
Keep your dad some company
for a while.


913
1:13:55,139 --> 1:14:0,727
Have a seat.


914
1:14:0,727 --> 1:14:3,647
Listen, I'm being transferred.


915
1:14:3,647 --> 1:14:6,108
Now, this has nothing to do
with what happened.


916
1:14:6,108 --> 1:14:8,193
My captain duties are done here.


917
1:14:8,193 --> 1:14:14,241
Going back to Fort Bragg.
I actually miss my famiIy.


918
1:14:14,241 --> 1:14:15,576
That's good, sir.


919
1:14:15,576 --> 1:14:19,705
Berry and Daniels are getting out, the
others, coming down on assignment.


920
1:14:19,705 --> 1:14:23,792
-And you've got Iess than four months--
-I'm definitely extending.


921
1:14:23,792 --> 1:14:28,213
Your war is over, John.
You served your country well.


922
1:14:28,213 --> 1:14:33,218
You know what?
I might just make this a career.


923
1:14:33,218 --> 1:15:3,874
No talking you out of this, huh?


924
1:15:3,874 --> 1:15:8,545
Mark, on my mark!


925
1:15:8,545 --> 1:15:20,432
Mark!


926
1:15:20,432 --> 1:15:23,685
Where you thinking next?


927
1:15:23,685 --> 1:15:27,439
Oh, man. I don't know,
wherever they send us.


928
1:15:27,439 --> 1:15:32,486
Actually, we're sending you home
to the States, John.


929
1:15:32,486 --> 1:15:54,258
I'm sorry, we just got the news.


930
1:15:54,258 --> 1:15:57,135
He's conscious, but he's not lucid.


931
1:15:57,135 --> 1:15:59,68
And he's hardIy ever responsive.


932
1:15:59,68 --> 1:16:2,933
It's hard for me to say
how severe the stroke really is...


933
1:16:2,933 --> 1:16:7,396
...because we don't know how long
he was down before they found him.


934
1:16:7,396 --> 1:16:12,109
If l'd have been there
to find him like that earlier...


935
1:16:12,109 --> 1:16:15,279
...do you think it would've
made a difference?


936
1:16:15,279 --> 1:17:29,478
I doubt it. I really doubt it.


937
1:17:29,478 --> 1:17:46,203
-Hey, Jeff, here's that scan.
-No problem.


938
1:17:46,203 --> 1:17:48,163
Hey, Pop.


939
1:17:48,163 --> 1:17:54,753
What--? What the heck do you--?
Ma'am, why do you have him out here?


940
1:17:54,753 --> 1:18:2,594
You okay? How you feeIing?


941
1:18:2,594 --> 1:18:6,765
I....


942
1:18:6,765 --> 1:18:18,318
I mean, it's nothing, but I wrote you--
I wrote you a Ietter.


943
1:18:18,318 --> 1:18:20,779
No, no, don't read it now.
You don't have to--


944
1:18:20,779 --> 1:18:31,873
I didn't think you'd-- Why don't you
read it when I'm not around?


945
1:18:31,873 --> 1:18:44,97
You know what? The hell with it.
I'll just read it to you.


946
1:18:44,97 --> 1:18:46,972
"Dear Dad.


947
1:18:46,972 --> 1:18:51,309
There's something
I've been wanting to tell you.


948
1:18:51,309 --> 1:18:54,312
You remember a few years back...


949
1:18:54,312 --> 1:18:58,316
...when I got shot.


950
1:18:58,316 --> 1:19:0,569
Well, you wanna know
the very first thing...


951
1:19:0,569 --> 1:19:3,28
...that entered my mind
at that moment?


952
1:19:3,28 --> 1:19:8,952
Right before I blacked out?


953
1:19:8,952 --> 1:19:13,206
Coins.


954
1:19:13,206 --> 1:19:15,667
Suddenly I was 8 years old again.


955
1:19:15,667 --> 1:19:18,3
I was on that tour of the U.S. Mint.


956
1:19:18,3 --> 1:19:21,256
I was listening to the guide explain
how coins are made.


957
1:19:21,256 --> 1:19:25,343
How they're punched out of sheet metal
and how they're rimmed and beveled.


958
1:19:25,343 --> 1:19:27,804
How they're stamped and cleaned.


959
1:19:27,804 --> 1:19:31,349
And how each and every batch
of coins are personally examined...


960
1:19:31,349 --> 1:19:37,898
...in case any have slipped through
with the slightest imperfection.


961
1:19:37,898 --> 1:19:39,316
Do you remember that, Dad?


962
1:19:39,316 --> 1:19:46,573
I mean, do you remember that trip
to Philadelphia we took?


963
1:19:46,573 --> 1:19:52,412
That's what popped into my head.


964
1:19:52,412 --> 1:19:57,751
I'm a coin of the United States Army.


965
1:19:57,751 --> 1:20:1,88
And I was minted in the year 1 980.


966
1:20:1,88 --> 1:20:4,674
I've been punched from sheet metal.


967
1:20:4,674 --> 1:20:8,428
I've been stamped and cleaned.


968
1:20:8,428 --> 1:20:15,227
And my edges have been
rimmed and beveled.


969
1:20:15,227 --> 1:20:18,73
But now I have
two small holes in me.


970
1:20:18,73 --> 1:20:25,237
So l'm no longer
in perfect condition."


971
1:20:25,237 --> 1:20:35,8
How about it, Dad? You know,
we're just a couple of cuIls here, huh?


972
1:20:35,8 --> 1:20:38,291
"But there's one--
There's one more thing...


973
1:20:38,291 --> 1:20:44,714
...that l want to telI you too.


974
1:20:44,714 --> 1:20:55,934
After l got shot, you know,
right before I blacked out.


975
1:20:55,934 --> 1:21:1,147
You wanna know the very last thing
I thought of?"


976
1:21:1,147 --> 1:21:12,617
I'm sorry.


977
1:21:12,617 --> 1:21:15,453
The very last thing I thought of....


978
1:21:15,453 --> 1:22:56,304
You wanna know the very last thing
I thought of?


979
1:22:56,304 --> 1:23:0,767
I'm so sorRY,
I don't want to rush you...


980
1:23:0,767 --> 1:24:38,156
...but we have another service
coming in.


981
1:24:38,156 --> 1:24:52,712
John.


982
1:24:52,712 --> 1:24:57,717
What brings you home?


983
1:24:57,717 --> 1:25:1,805
It's my dad.


984
1:25:1,805 --> 1:25:4,933
How's your dad?


985
1:25:4,933 --> 1:25:16,736
He....


986
1:25:16,736 --> 1:25:19,948
I'm sorry.


987
1:25:19,948 --> 1:25:24,661
I wish I had known.


988
1:25:24,661 --> 1:25:27,33
It's okay.


989
1:25:27,33 --> 1:25:29,958
It wouldn't have made
any difference.


990
1:25:29,958 --> 1:25:32,21
I'm so sorRY.


991
1:25:32,21 --> 1:25:46,15
He's-- He was a really good man.


992
1:25:46,15 --> 1:25:50,145
You finally did it, huh?


993
1:25:50,145 --> 1:25:52,397
Camp Horse Sense.


994
1:25:52,397 --> 1:25:54,44
No.


995
1:25:54,44 --> 1:25:57,819
I didn't. I tried.


996
1:25:57,819 --> 1:26:2,532
It only lasted one summer after we
took over this place from my parents.


997
1:26:2,532 --> 1:26:21,718
It was.... It was expensive.


998
1:26:21,718 --> 1:26:24,721
Do you want to come inside?


999
1:26:24,721 --> 1:26:30,185
It's just me.


1000
1:26:30,185 --> 1:26:33,521
When do you have to go back?


1001
1:26:33,521 --> 1:26:41,613
As soon as I get my dad's stuff
squared away.


1002
1:26:41,613 --> 1:26:44,282
Have you settled down yet?


1003
1:26:44,282 --> 1:26:47,243
No.


1004
1:26:47,243 --> 1:26:49,704
But you must be dating a lot, huh?


1005
1:26:49,704 --> 1:26:56,336
No. I don't think you can call it
dating exactly.


1006
1:26:56,336 --> 1:26:58,88
It's so good to see you.


1007
1:26:58,88 --> 1:27:5,887
Here. Alive.


1008
1:27:5,887 --> 1:27:11,1
Hold on. I'm just gonna-- I'm sorry.


1009
1:27:11,1 --> 1:27:13,61
Hello?


1010
1:27:13,61 --> 1:27:15,21
Hey.


1011
1:27:15,21 --> 1:27:23,78
No, I'm fine.


1012
1:27:23,78 --> 1:27:25,573
I....


1013
1:27:25,573 --> 1:27:30,453
Well, John-- John is here.


1014
1:27:30,453 --> 1:27:35,625
Yeah, John Tyree.


1015
1:27:35,625 --> 1:27:39,45
Yeah, I'm gonna leave soon.


1016
1:27:39,45 --> 1:27:40,964
Okay, l'Il see you.


1017
1:27:40,964 --> 1:27:43,383
I'll be there in like
20 minutes, okay?


1018
1:27:43,383 --> 1:27:52,183
I love you too. Bye.


1019
1:27:52,183 --> 1:27:54,352
He wants to see you.


1020
1:27:54,352 --> 1:28:0,108
Wait, what?


1021
1:28:0,108 --> 1:28:7,907
It's Tim?


1022
1:28:7,907 --> 1:28:12,37
Initially after he was diagnosed,
he was so optimistic.


1023
1:28:12,37 --> 1:28:14,914
He wasn't concerned,
all he cared about was AIan...


1024
1:28:14,914 --> 1:28:17,41
...which was inspiring.


1025
1:28:17,41 --> 1:28:23,89
It wasn't until after the cancer spread to
stage four that I noticed a big change.


1026
1:28:23,89 --> 1:28:25,717
What kind of cancer is it?


1027
1:28:25,717 --> 1:28:29,721
Lymphoma.


1028
1:28:29,721 --> 1:28:32,98
He's had it with being cooped up
in that room...


1029
1:28:32,98 --> 1:28:34,726
...so he basically just spends
all his time out here.


1030
1:28:34,726 --> 1:28:42,15
Sometimes with Alan.


1031
1:28:42,15 --> 1:28:47,155
-Can I have a crumble cake?
-Alan, do you remember John?


1032
1:28:47,155 --> 1:28:48,906
Hello, John.


1033
1:28:48,906 --> 1:28:50,408
Hey, AIan.


1034
1:28:50,408 --> 1:28:53,328
He's gotten big.


1035
1:28:53,328 --> 1:28:58,624
-How are you?
-Good.


1036
1:28:58,624 --> 1:29:0,376
I'm gonna get him a crumble cake.


1037
1:29:0,376 --> 1:29:3,212
Oh, that's a good idea.
He's been talking about that.


1038
1:29:3,212 --> 1:29:10,386
Come on, Alan.


1039
1:29:10,386 --> 1:29:13,848
I guess you must want to
kick my ass, huh?


1040
1:29:13,848 --> 1:29:20,396
There's not a lot I can
do about it here, is there?


1041
1:29:20,396 --> 1:29:23,941
It's all part of my master plan.


1042
1:29:23,941 --> 1:29:29,53
Hell of a plan.


1043
1:29:29,53 --> 1:29:33,159
I love her.


1044
1:29:33,159 --> 1:29:38,456
Everything that happened
in my Iife before, it's gone now.


1045
1:29:38,456 --> 1:29:41,667
It's been wiped clean.


1046
1:29:41,667 --> 1:29:46,5
I wanted to tell you that.


1047
1:29:46,5 --> 1:29:49,967
And I'm sorry.


1048
1:29:49,967 --> 1:29:54,722
I'm sorry for how it happened
with you so far away.


1049
1:29:54,722 --> 1:30:2,146
But l know now that Alan will always
have someone to take care of him.


1050
1:30:2,146 --> 1:30:23,42
He will always be in good hands.


1051
1:30:23,42 --> 1:30:25,837
She still loves you, you know.


1052
1:30:25,837 --> 1:30:27,797
Why is it black?


1053
1:30:27,797 --> 1:30:33,1
It's plain as day, you can see it
all over her face.


1054
1:30:33,1 --> 1:30:35,596
I wish that weren't the case...


1055
1:30:35,596 --> 1:30:43,2
...but she's never looked at me
the way she used to look at you.


1056
1:30:43,2 --> 1:30:56,2
You shouId know that.


1057
1:30:56,2 --> 1:31:1,664
Be careful, AIan.


1058
1:31:1,664 --> 1:31:3,875
He still loves those horses, huh?


1059
1:31:3,875 --> 1:31:8,171
Yeah, he'll be out there till bedtime.


1060
1:31:8,171 --> 1:31:12,175
I gotta get him out of that hospital.


1061
1:31:12,175 --> 1:31:15,386
He needs to come home.


1062
1:31:15,386 --> 1:31:20,808
There's a company in Texas
with an experimental drug.


1063
1:31:20,808 --> 1:31:24,687
That might help.


1064
1:31:24,687 --> 1:31:29,734
But the insurance companies
don't pay for it, of course.


1065
1:31:29,734 --> 1:31:33,112
My parents sold their beach house
a year ago.


1066
1:31:33,112 --> 1:31:36,491
Which was a godsend.


1067
1:31:36,491 --> 1:31:41,579
We've done a few fundraisers.


1068
1:31:41,579 --> 1:31:53,758
But l never would have guessed
that we would run out so fast.


1069
1:31:53,758 --> 1:32:2,475
Stay for dinner, okay?


1070
1:32:2,475 --> 1:32:4,435
So you drink now.


1071
1:32:4,435 --> 1:32:7,355
Just a glass or two at dinner.


1072
1:32:7,355 --> 1:32:18,533
Tim got me started
a couple years ago.


1073
1:32:18,533 --> 1:32:20,535
Why are you looking at me
like that?


1074
1:32:20,535 --> 1:32:22,495
What do you mean?


1075
1:32:22,495 --> 1:32:25,289
How am I looking at you?


1076
1:32:25,289 --> 1:32:28,501
Differently.


1077
1:32:28,501 --> 1:32:31,629
I don't know, how do you
want me to look at you?


1078
1:32:31,629 --> 1:32:43,641
You're different.


1079
1:32:43,641 --> 1:32:48,396
I don't know--


1080
1:32:48,396 --> 1:32:55,987
I don't know why I came here.
I mean, what are we doing?


1081
1:32:55,987 --> 1:32:58,781
We're sitting here
and we're eating and we're talking...


1082
1:32:58,781 --> 1:33:1,117
...but no one's
actually saying anything.


1083
1:33:1,117 --> 1:33:11,46
What do you want me to say?
What do you want to talk about?


1084
1:33:11,46 --> 1:33:16,841
Why didn't you call?


1085
1:33:16,841 --> 1:33:21,53
Why didn't you call me?


1086
1:33:21,53 --> 1:33:27,351
I mean, did I not deserve any more
explanation than...


1087
1:33:27,351 --> 1:33:30,104
...that letter?


1088
1:33:30,104 --> 1:33:31,856
You couldn't have called me?


1089
1:33:31,856 --> 1:33:36,152
You couldn't have given me some
sort of chance to change your mind?


1090
1:33:36,152 --> 1:33:42,783
Don't you think you owed me that?


1091
1:33:42,783 --> 1:33:44,368
I couldn't.


1092
1:33:44,368 --> 1:33:45,62
You couldn't?


1093
1:33:45,62 --> 1:33:49,915
You thought that little of me
that you couldn't have just called me.


1094
1:33:49,915 --> 1:33:52,1
Why?


1095
1:33:52,1 --> 1:33:55,171
Because I couldn't.


1096
1:33:55,171 --> 1:33:57,6
Give me an answer.
Why? Why not?


1097
1:33:57,6 --> 1:33:58,883
-Because I couIdn't.
-An answer.


1098
1:33:58,883 --> 1:34:8,225
Because just hearing your voice,
I would have changed my mind.


1099
1:34:8,225 --> 1:34:12,438
Is that what you wanna hear, John?
What you came all this way to hear?


1100
1:34:12,438 --> 1:34:16,859
You think it was tough out there?
Think it was easy for me without you?


1101
1:34:16,859 --> 1:34:19,236
You thought that
eveRY single day it wasn't...


1102
1:34:19,236 --> 1:34:23,282
...a goddamn marathon
of my life without you?


1103
1:34:23,282 --> 1:34:26,77
Tim was sick.


1104
1:34:26,77 --> 1:34:28,245
He was sick and he needed me.


1105
1:34:28,245 --> 1:34:30,39
He needed me to help him.


1106
1:34:30,39 --> 1:34:33,751
He needed me to help him
with Alan, with everything.


1107
1:34:33,751 --> 1:34:39,9
I was alone and I had no idea
what I was doing.


1108
1:34:39,9 --> 1:34:43,177
I didn't plan this. I didn't know
that it was gonna happen to me.


1109
1:34:43,177 --> 1:34:45,471
But it did.


1110
1:34:45,471 --> 1:34:47,765
You don't think I've tried--?


1111
1:34:47,765 --> 1:34:51,6
I picked up the phone
a thousand times to try to call you.


1112
1:34:51,6 --> 1:34:59,26
You think that I really wanna be
standing here in front of you like this?


1113
1:34:59,26 --> 1:35:2,154
I had no choice.


1114
1:35:2,154 --> 1:35:13,958
I know.


1115
1:35:13,958 --> 1:35:18,129
I saved eveRY single one of them.


1116
1:35:18,129 --> 1:35:23,968
You've been so many places.


1117
1:35:23,968 --> 1:35:27,555
I think the yeIlow enveIopes
are from Africa or something.


1118
1:35:27,555 --> 1:35:29,89
Really?


1119
1:35:29,89 --> 1:35:35,563
I even have your first,
your veRY first letter to me.


1120
1:35:35,563 --> 1:35:47,116
Tim's water bill.


1121
1:35:47,116 --> 1:35:49,66
Sorry.


1122
1:35:49,66 --> 1:35:54,498
It's okay.


1123
1:35:54,498 --> 1:36:23,694
Hope you have more
where that came from.


1124
1:36:23,694 --> 1:36:48,385
I'm gonna put a pot of coffee on.


1125
1:36:48,385 --> 1:37:4,86
I should go.


1126
1:37:4,86 --> 1:37:12,91
I'll see you soon, then?


1127
1:37:12,91 --> 1:37:15,329
Say it back.


1128
1:37:15,329 --> 1:37:19,583
When I say it, you say it.


1129
1:37:19,583 --> 1:37:27,216
Remember?


1130
1:37:27,216 --> 1:37:31,47
John?


1131
1:37:31,47 --> 1:37:44,775
Just say it.


1132
1:37:44,775 --> 1:38:44,835
Goodbye, Savannah.


1133
1:38:44,835 --> 1:38:49,89
I don't think you remember me. But I
believe you knew my father, Bill Tyree.


1134
1:38:49,89 --> 1:38:53,52
Oh, yeah, of course I did. I haven't
seen him in a while, though. How is he?


1135
1:38:53,52 --> 1:38:56,931
He recently passed.


1136
1:38:56,931 --> 1:38:59,224
I'm sorry.


1137
1:38:59,224 --> 1:39:3,354
I think you might've offered to buy his
coin collection one time. ls that right?


1138
1:39:3,354 --> 1:39:5,648
Sure did. More than once.


1139
1:39:5,648 --> 1:39:10,69
Just out of curiosity, how much do you
think a collection Iike his is worth?


1140
1:39:10,69 --> 1:39:16,7
A collection that big?
I don't know, I'd have to see it.


1141
1:39:16,7 --> 1:39:21,455
Look, I only got about one condition.


1142
1:39:21,455 --> 1:39:24,41
All the mules,
they gotta stay together.


1143
1:39:24,41 --> 1:39:27,86
You can sell them as a set
or keep them for yourself.


1144
1:39:27,86 --> 1:39:28,587
They have to stay together.


1145
1:39:28,587 --> 1:39:30,881
You're really going to seIl me
all his coins?


1146
1:39:30,881 --> 1:39:32,716
Yes, sir.


1147
1:39:32,716 --> 1:39:36,72
All but one.


1148
1:39:36,72 --> 1:39:40,182
This comes up nickel, we're gonna
set up right here. We got shade.


1149
1:39:40,182 --> 1:39:46,146
It comes up penny, we'll be up
on the ridge. We got visibility.


1150
1:39:46,146 --> 1:39:52,528
-That'd be penny side.
-All right, let's go to the ridge.


1151
1:39:52,528 --> 1:39:55,406
Sergeant.


1152
1:39:55,406 --> 1:40:1,912
Thank you.


1153
1:40:1,912 --> 1:40:4,832
Dear John...


1154
1:40:4,832 --> 1:40:8,168
...it's been almost five years
since I wrote with an actual pen...


1155
1:40:8,168 --> 1:40:11,422
...on an actual sheet of paper.


1156
1:40:11,422 --> 1:40:13,424
I thought L couLd write and teLl you...


1157
1:40:13,424 --> 1:40:17,177
...all that's happened
since I saw you last.


1158
1:40:17,177 --> 1:40:19,263
A few weeks
after you showed up here...


1159
1:40:19,263 --> 1:40:22,933
...Tim received
an anonymous donation.


1160
1:40:22,933 --> 1:40:25,19
A donation that was enough
to give him...


1161
1:40:25,19 --> 1:40:28,772
...what the insurance companies
wouIdn't:


1162
1:40:28,772 --> 1:40:33,318
Time.


1163
1:40:33,318 --> 1:40:37,114
Time to finalIy come home.


1164
1:40:37,114 --> 1:40:41,618
Time to spend with his son.


1165
1:40:41,618 --> 1:40:46,206
Time to say goodbye.


1166
1:40:46,206 --> 1:40:48,417
The problem with time,
I've learned...


1167
1:40:48,417 --> 1:40:52,46
...whether it's those first two weeks
I got to spend with you...


1168
1:40:52,46 --> 1:40:55,632
...or those final two months
I got to spend with him...


1169
1:40:55,632 --> 1:41:1,513
...eventuaLly time aLways runs out.


1170
1:41:1,513 --> 1:41:5,517
I have no idea where you are
out there in the world, John.


1171
1:41:5,517 --> 1:41:12,316
But L understand that I Lost the right
to know these things long ago.


1172
1:41:12,316 --> 1:41:16,7
No matter how many years go by...


1173
1:41:16,7 --> 1:41:21,95
...I know one thing
to be as true as it ever was.


1174
1:41:21,95 --> 1:43:21,95
I'Ll see you soon, then.
