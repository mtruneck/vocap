[MUSIC PLAYING]


3
0:0:10,951 --> 0:0:18,106



4
0:0:18,106 --> 0:0:20,5
STEPHANIE IZARD: All right,
cheers to me.


5
0:0:20,5 --> 0:0:24,88



6
0:0:24,88 --> 0:0:27,778
Holy shit, I am not drinking
that whole thing.


7
0:0:27,778 --> 0:0:29,227
Beautiful.


8
0:0:29,227 --> 0:0:30,79
It's just fun in here.


9
0:0:30,79 --> 0:0:32,58
It is like a party
all the time.


10
0:0:32,58 --> 0:0:34,54
For me, it's just all about
flavor and it's having people


11
0:0:34,54 --> 0:0:36,26
take a bite and then
they're like whoa.


12
0:0:36,26 --> 0:0:37,11
And there's just so much flavor


13
0:0:37,11 --> 0:0:39,54
going on in their mouths.


14
0:0:39,54 --> 0:0:42,212
My name is Stephanie Izard, I'm
the chef and owner of Girl


15
0:0:42,212 --> 0:0:42,81
& The Goat.


16
0:0:42,81 --> 0:0:45,27
I went to University of Michigan
for undergrad first.


17
0:0:45,27 --> 0:0:46,45
I was a sociology major.


18
0:0:46,45 --> 0:0:48,77
I started working at the Olive
Garden, that was my first


19
0:0:48,77 --> 0:0:50,115
industry job.


20
0:0:50,115 --> 0:0:52,58
Their bread sticks are pretty
damn tasty, I'm


21
0:0:52,58 --> 0:0:53,86
not going to lie.


22
0:0:53,86 --> 0:0:55,7
After college I ended up going
to culinary school.


23
0:0:55,7 --> 0:0:57,31
My dad was like, you know, you
haven't found anything you


24
0:0:57,31 --> 0:0:59,125
love in college as much as you
love cooking, so you should go


25
0:0:59,125 --> 0:1:0,2
to culinary school.


26
0:1:0,2 --> 0:1:1,72
And I think at the time I
really thought that you


27
0:1:1,72 --> 0:1:4,99
graduate culinary school
and you're like a chef.


28
0:1:4,99 --> 0:1:5,68
I didn't get that you graduate
culinary school and you make


29
0:1:5,68 --> 0:1:7,39
$7 an hour and you make salads,
but I was super


30
0:1:7,39 --> 0:1:8,68
excited anyway.


31
0:1:8,68 --> 0:1:11,2
So my dad's like, you're going
to make $7 an hour?


32
0:1:11,2 --> 0:1:13,15
I was like yeah, I'm going
to make some salads.


33
0:1:13,15 --> 0:1:14,37
It's going to be awesome.


34
0:1:14,37 --> 0:1:16,17
The restaurant I was working at
closed for renovations, and


35
0:1:16,17 --> 0:1:18,51
I came out to Chicago to visit
some friends for a few days.


36
0:1:18,51 --> 0:1:21,15
While I was out here, it was
June when it's actually


37
0:1:21,15 --> 0:1:21,94
beautiful here.


38
0:1:21,94 --> 0:1:23,77
And there were just nice
people and cute boys


39
0:1:23,77 --> 0:1:26,98
everywhere and I was like,
I'm moving to Chicago.


40
0:1:26,98 --> 0:1:28,36
I make decisions just
sort of last minute


41
0:1:28,36 --> 0:1:29,61
without telling anybody.


42
0:1:29,61 --> 0:1:38,58



43
0:1:38,58 --> 0:1:41,48
So these are my two not a lot
of hair Jared friends.


44
0:1:41,48 --> 0:1:44,72
I've actually known this not a
lot of hair Jared for longer.


45
0:1:44,72 --> 0:1:47,26
When did we meet, like
four years ago?


46
0:1:47,26 --> 0:1:48,225
JARED VAN CAMP: Four or
five years ago, yeah.


47
0:1:48,225 --> 0:1:49,6
STEPHANIE IZARD: I was dating
his friend who's


48
0:1:49,6 --> 0:1:50,59
a chef in the city.


49
0:1:50,59 --> 0:1:52,945
JARED VAN CAMP: Yeah,
I remember it.


50
0:1:52,945 --> 0:1:56,53
STEPHANIE IZARD: And this is
Jared I met like, what did we


51
0:1:56,53 --> 0:1:57,806
decide, two months ago?


52
0:1:57,806 --> 0:1:58,67
JARED ROUBEN: I think so.


53
0:1:58,67 --> 0:2:2,95
JARED VAN CAMP: So, we got cotto
salami, finocchiona,


54
0:2:2,95 --> 0:2:7,92
toscano salami, chorizo,
sopressata, a little pastrami,


55
0:2:7,92 --> 0:2:11,85
pate de compagne, some toast,
picalilly, and some assorted


56
0:2:11,85 --> 0:2:13,2
pickles and olives.


57
0:2:13,2 --> 0:2:14,31
STEPHANIE IZARD: Yeah, I was
actually thinking about this


58
0:2:14,31 --> 0:2:15,65
this afternoon, because I was
thinking about meeting up with


59
0:2:15,65 --> 0:2:17,57
you and we're going
to go find Koren.


60
0:2:17,57 --> 0:2:19,7
All of our chefs that are--
and I was like are we the


61
0:2:19,7 --> 0:2:19,96
young generation?


62
0:2:19,96 --> 0:2:23,11
I was like, we're kind of like
the medium-age generation.


63
0:2:23,11 --> 0:2:24,63
But it's sort of like
our generation.


64
0:2:24,63 --> 0:2:26,69
Nothing against the slightly--


65
0:2:26,69 --> 0:2:27,485
JARED VAN CAMP: Older?


66
0:2:27,485 --> 0:2:29,535
STEPHANIE IZARD: Just ahead of
our time, but people we all


67
0:2:29,535 --> 0:2:31,97
worked for like Shawn McClain,
and Paul Kahan, and Rick


68
0:2:31,97 --> 0:2:34,57
Bayless and Charlie Trotter,
and all the people that--


69
0:2:34,57 --> 0:2:35,9
JARED VAN CAMP: Yeah,
for sure.


70
0:2:35,9 --> 0:2:37,2
STEPHANIE IZARD: And now we're
just sort of the people that


71
0:2:37,2 --> 0:2:37,69
worked for them.


72
0:2:37,69 --> 0:2:39,88
And now we're all just
buddy buddies, let's


73
0:2:39,88 --> 0:2:40,55
make Chicago awesome.


74
0:2:40,55 --> 0:2:42,28
JARED VAN CAMP: It's one of the
coolest things about being


75
0:2:42,28 --> 0:2:45,14
in Chicago, is the camaraderie
in the industry.


76
0:2:45,14 --> 0:2:47,9
STEPHANIE IZARD: We just want
the city to get better.


77
0:2:47,9 --> 0:2:49,44
We want to open fun, cool
restaurants and support local


78
0:2:49,44 --> 0:2:50,69
and do as many charities
as we can.


79
0:2:50,69 --> 0:2:53,2
And all do it together because
you can't do it by yourself.


80
0:2:53,2 --> 0:2:55,73
I think chefs all love hanging
out with each other because we


81
0:2:55,73 --> 0:2:57,15
also learn from each other.


82
0:2:57,15 --> 0:3:0,13
So I guess the more stuff I can
get out there and do while


83
0:3:0,13 --> 0:3:2,978
still keeping this place
running, the better.


84
0:3:2,978 --> 0:3:8,25



85
0:3:8,25 --> 0:3:12,92
So then I take both Jareds, both
non-hair Jareds, over to


86
0:3:12,92 --> 0:3:15,16
Avec because it's my favorite
restaurant in the city.


87
0:3:15,16 --> 0:3:16,52
Yeah, whenever I'm asked what's
the favorite restaurant


88
0:3:16,52 --> 0:3:18,38
in the city, Avec, Avec, Avec.


89
0:3:18,38 --> 0:3:21,13
Going to Avec is going and
hanging with your friends and


90
0:3:21,13 --> 0:3:23,4
drinking and eating and
exactly what we


91
0:3:23,4 --> 0:3:24,29
try to capture here.


92
0:3:24,29 --> 0:3:28,935



93
0:3:28,935 --> 0:3:30,27
Koren's just cool.


94
0:3:30,27 --> 0:3:34,19
We became friends a couple
of years ago.


95
0:3:34,19 --> 0:3:36,76
I mean, maybe a little bit of
it is like oh, cool, another


96
0:3:36,76 --> 0:3:38,74
cool chick chef that I
can hang out with.


97
0:3:38,74 --> 0:3:41,96
But we hang out at events
together, we're just sort of


98
0:3:41,96 --> 0:3:44,1
into supporting the
same things.


99
0:3:44,1 --> 0:3:45,975
Brandade, brandade, and--


100
0:3:45,975 --> 0:3:48,14
JARED VAN CAMP: No, no,
Stephanie, it's OK.


101
0:3:48,14 --> 0:3:49,264
No, really, I'm sorry.


102
0:3:49,264 --> 0:3:52,316



103
0:3:52,316 --> 0:3:53,75
KOREN GRIEVESON:
Grammer pizza.


104
0:3:53,75 --> 0:3:55,9
STEPHANIE IZARD: Queso, fresco,
green figs, Serrano,


105
0:3:55,9 --> 0:3:57,85
and de coto.


106
0:3:57,85 --> 0:3:57,65
JARED VAN CAMP: I like that.


107
0:3:57,65 --> 0:3:58,9
STEPHANIE IZARD: So
just delisio?


108
0:3:58,9 --> 0:4:1,81



109
0:4:1,81 --> 0:4:2,88
STEPHANIE IZARD: Delisio
ricotta--


110
0:4:2,88 --> 0:4:3,78
KOREN GRIEVESON: A little
truffle oil.


111
0:4:3,78 --> 0:4:6,655
STEPHANIE IZARD: A little
truffle oil in between


112
0:4:6,655 --> 0:4:8,82
flatbread that's sliced
really thin, and


113
0:4:8,82 --> 0:4:10,25
it's freaking delicious.


114
0:4:10,25 --> 0:4:15,14
You're probably my only close,
female friend chef.


115
0:4:15,14 --> 0:4:16,1
STEPHANIE IZARD: Anything.


116
0:4:16,1 --> 0:4:16,576
JARED ROUBEN: Boom.


117
0:4:16,576 --> 0:4:17,529
KOREN GRIEVESON: Let's
put it out there.


118
0:4:17,529 --> 0:4:19,8
STEPHANIE IZARD: In this city
though, I don't have any other


119
0:4:19,8 --> 0:4:20,8
chick chef friends.


120
0:4:20,8 --> 0:4:22,99
I think that most women
just decide to either


121
0:4:22,99 --> 0:4:23,78
go one way or another.


122
0:4:23,78 --> 0:4:26,6
They're going to go have a
family and have children, or


123
0:4:26,6 --> 0:4:27,73
stick with a career.


124
0:4:27,73 --> 0:4:29,37
Maybe that's why there's
not so many.


125
0:4:29,37 --> 0:4:30,98
It always comes up
in conversation.


126
0:4:30,98 --> 0:4:33,8
Why are there so few females?


127
0:4:33,8 --> 0:4:36,11
And I don't know, maybe more
chicks should be doing this I


128
0:4:36,11 --> 0:4:37,36
guess would be my answer.


129
0:4:37,36 --> 0:4:46,5



130
0:4:46,5 --> 0:4:47,6
STEPHANIE IZARD: It is.


131
0:4:47,6 --> 0:4:48,61
I mean, for anyone.


132
0:4:48,61 --> 0:4:51,24
It's suddenly taking
a toll on me.


133
0:4:51,24 --> 0:4:53,63
Yesterday, I honestly, to leave
work early, and I just


134
0:4:53,63 --> 0:4:55,395
slept for 12 hours straight.


135
0:4:55,395 --> 0:4:58,2
For some reason there are just
more men in the industry.


136
0:4:58,2 --> 0:5:0,26
And I think part of it's
also when I started


137
0:5:0,26 --> 0:5:1,4
working on the industry--


138
0:5:1,4 --> 0:5:3,29
I'm not easily offended and
nothing that guys can say in


139
0:5:3,29 --> 0:5:5,1
the kitchen is going to
bother me whatsoever.


140
0:5:5,1 --> 0:5:8,9
If they want to talk about
picking up chicks, or I'm not


141
0:5:8,9 --> 0:5:9,89
going to get into the
things that get


142
0:5:9,89 --> 0:5:10,84
talked about in kitchens.


143
0:5:10,84 --> 0:5:13,49
But if you're easily offended
it's not going to work well


144
0:5:13,49 --> 0:5:14,86
for you, I'll just say
that for women.


145
0:5:14,86 --> 0:5:16,28
I love the brandade.


146
0:5:16,28 --> 0:5:19,25
Salty, creamy goodness with
little teeny specks of [BLEEP]


147
0:5:19,25 --> 0:5:19,62
crunchy.


148
0:5:19,62 --> 0:5:21,508
JARED ROUBEN: It is
so delicious.


149
0:5:21,508 --> 0:5:22,924
STEPHANIE IZARD: I know.


150
0:5:22,924 --> 0:5:23,87
JARED VAN CAMP: Hold on.


151
0:5:23,87 --> 0:5:26,3
Salty, creamy goodness
with little [BLEEP]


152
0:5:26,3 --> 0:5:26,6
specks of


153
0:5:26,6 --> 0:5:27,79
STEPHANIE IZARD: A teeny
spice of crunchy.


154
0:5:27,79 --> 0:5:32,332
JARED VAN CAMP: You should put
it on the menu as that.


155
0:5:32,332 --> 0:5:34,42
STEPHANIE IZARD: After Avec, we
walked down the street with


156
0:5:34,42 --> 0:5:37,77
our new little posse of
chefs, walking back


157
0:5:37,77 --> 0:5:38,42
to Girl & The Goat.


158
0:5:38,42 --> 0:5:41,36
We were doing this "Elle"
magazine shoot a few weeks


159
0:5:41,36 --> 0:5:44,44
ago, and they wanted us to look
like we were after work


160
0:5:44,44 --> 0:5:46,8
eating lamb shanks together
and stuff.


161
0:5:46,8 --> 0:5:47,785
And I was like, why don't
we do that after work?


162
0:5:47,785 --> 0:5:49,35
That's pretty sweet.


163
0:5:49,35 --> 0:5:52,1



164
0:5:52,1 --> 0:5:55,1
So it's basically grilled
octopus with a fish sauce


165
0:5:55,1 --> 0:5:55,55
vinaigrette.


166
0:5:55,55 --> 0:5:58,15
Fava beans, yellow wax beans, a
little bit of the house wine


167
0:5:58,15 --> 0:6:1,695
[INAUDIBLE], and some lemon
pistachio vinaigrette.


168
0:6:1,695 --> 0:6:3,55
It's one of my favorite
things I make.


169
0:6:3,55 --> 0:6:6,532



170
0:6:6,532 --> 0:6:7,782
ALL: Cheers!


171
0:6:7,782 --> 0:6:13,987



172
0:6:13,987 --> 0:6:16,25
STEPHANIE IZARD: One of my
bartenders one day, I got to


173
0:6:16,25 --> 0:6:17,18
work, he's like what's
the deal?


174
0:6:17,18 --> 0:6:18,73
He's like, you work
18 hours a day--


175
0:6:18,73 --> 0:6:21,27
18, 19, 20, 21, 22--


176
0:6:21,27 --> 0:6:24,11
drink four and sleep two,
if that adds up to 24.


177
0:6:24,11 --> 0:6:25,702
I'm not even sure right now.


178
0:6:25,702 --> 0:6:28,265
MALE SPEAKER: I'm getting paid
and I'm eating food?


179
0:6:28,265 --> 0:6:29,69
This is awesome.


180
0:6:29,69 --> 0:6:31,4
FEMALE SPEAKER: Cheers
to you, [INAUDIBLE].


181
0:6:31,4 --> 0:6:33,31
MALE SPEAKER: I'm going to get
out of here before we've got


182
0:6:33,31 --> 0:6:34,14
to clean up, for sure.


183
0:6:34,14 --> 0:6:36,396
I'm hopping on the bike
and I'm gone.


184
0:6:36,396 --> 0:6:37,59
JARED ROUBEN: Here's to being


185
0:6:37,59 --> 0:6:39,189
better-looking than that table.


186
0:6:39,189 --> 0:6:40,439
ALL: Woo!


187
0:6:40,439 --> 0:6:42,472



188
0:6:42,472 --> 0:6:43,41
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah!


189
0:6:43,41 --> 0:6:45,16
STEPHANIE IZARD: I mean, I don't
think you need to go out


190
0:6:45,16 --> 0:6:47,39
and party until 4:00 AM with
your chefs all the time--


191
0:6:47,39 --> 0:6:48,9
sometimes I do that.


192
0:6:48,9 --> 0:6:50,86
Even if I hang out with them,
and party with them, and take


193
0:6:50,86 --> 0:6:53,49
them to events and have a good
time, they still will listen


194
0:6:53,49 --> 0:6:56,2
when I'm like, you're not
plating that right.


195
0:6:56,2 --> 0:6:58,9
I guess there's different ways
of getting respect from people


196
0:6:58,9 --> 0:6:59,8
that work for you.


197
0:6:59,8 --> 0:7:2,53
And maybe there's some people
that work here that think I am


198
0:7:2,53 --> 0:7:5,56
just a crazy party girl and
they're like great boss lady.


199
0:7:5,56 --> 0:7:7,91
But I think for the most part
we've just created this really


200
0:7:7,91 --> 0:7:9,25
fun atmosphere to work in.


201
0:7:9,25 --> 0:7:12,3
I've worked places where I go
into other kitchens and it's


202
0:7:12,3 --> 0:7:14,16
absolute dead silence.


203
0:7:14,16 --> 0:7:15,25
And I've worked in a
kitchen where I got


204
0:7:15,25 --> 0:7:16,48
in trouble for laughing.


205
0:7:16,48 --> 0:7:19,21
And, I don't know, I laugh
a lot, I sing and


206
0:7:19,21 --> 0:7:20,46
dance with my cooks.


207
0:7:20,46 --> 0:7:25,789



208
0:7:25,789 --> 0:7:27,14
It's all about having fun.


209
0:7:27,14 --> 0:7:28,994
Eating's about having fun,
so cooking should be


210
0:7:28,994 --> 0:7:30,605
about having fun.


211
0:7:30,605 --> 0:7:32,585
JARED VAN CAMP: There we go!


212
0:7:32,585 --> 0:7:33,835
ALL: Woo hoo!


213
0:7:33,835 --> 0:9:33,835
