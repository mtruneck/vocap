1
0:0:5,857 --> 0:0:9,777
Who sends wedding invitations
in a shoe?


2
0:0:9,777 --> 0:0:11,415
I mean, I went to college.


3
0:0:11,415 --> 0:0:14,94
I never imagined this is how
I'd be making money.


4
0:0:14,94 --> 0:0:18,232
It's now how I imagined
you'd be making money either.


5
0:0:18,232 --> 0:0:21,461
But when I did imagine it,
you were wearing gold pumps.


6
0:0:21,461 --> 0:0:23,325
Please.


7
0:0:23,325 --> 0:0:24,724
I'm too much of a shoe whore


8
0:0:24,724 --> 0:0:27,19
to even think about these things
touching my feet.


9
0:0:27,19 --> 0:0:29,452
I'm so glad you said "shoe."


10
0:0:29,452 --> 0:0:30,518
What?


11
0:0:30,518 --> 0:0:33,115
How many more
do we have to do?


12
0:0:33,115 --> 0:0:35,581
I don't know, but bridezilla
just invited 30 more guests.


13
0:0:35,581 --> 0:0:37,213
I need to email the shoe store


14
0:0:37,213 --> 0:0:39,647
and ask them to hold
eight more boxes.


15
0:0:39,647 --> 0:0:41,681
No, no, no!


16
0:0:41,681 --> 0:0:42,781
Hey, baby.


17
0:0:42,781 --> 0:0:44,347
What's wrong?


18
0:0:44,347 --> 0:0:46,581
The Internet keeps going out.


19
0:0:46,581 --> 0:0:47,882
Let's see.


20
0:0:47,882 --> 0:0:50,583
It looks like you got a problem
with your reception.


21
0:0:50,583 --> 0:0:52,215
You only got one bar.


22
0:0:52,215 --> 0:0:55,15
Well, how many bars
do I need for Internet access?


23
0:0:55,15 --> 0:0:56,315
Usually two or three.


24
0:0:56,315 --> 0:0:59,115
What? You see, this is what
I'm talking about.


25
0:0:59,115 --> 0:1:0,648
Why would they tease you
with one bar?


26
0:1:0,648 --> 0:1:2,448
You're either on the Internet,
or you're not.


27
0:1:2,448 --> 0:1:3,449
"Here's one bar.


28
0:1:3,449 --> 0:1:4,882
"You're almost there,
not quite.


29
0:1:4,882 --> 0:1:6,949
We'll talk to you when you have
one or two more bars."


30
0:1:6,949 --> 0:1:8,484
It's just cruel.


31
0:1:8,484 --> 0:1:10,118
I'll take care of it
for you, baby.


32
0:1:10,118 --> 0:1:12,185
I'll pick up another wireless
router when I get back.


33
0:1:12,185 --> 0:1:13,886
Thank you, honey.


34
0:1:13,886 --> 0:1:17,321
What y'all doing,
cleaning out your closet?


35
0:1:17,321 --> 0:1:21,888
Please, like I'd wear shoes
without toe cleavage.


36
0:1:21,888 --> 0:1:23,521
Toe cleavage is only important
to a guy


37
0:1:23,521 --> 0:1:25,421
if your toes are a 36d.


38
0:1:25,421 --> 0:1:31,89
Clearly, he does not know
what I can do with my toes.

0:1:46,196 --> 0:1:47,929
Hey, Troy.
Come on in.


44
0:1:47,929 --> 0:1:49,663
Hi, Mr. Kingston-persons.


45
0:1:49,663 --> 0:1:52,65
How are you feeling today?


46
0:1:52,65 --> 0:1:53,532
I'm good.


47
0:1:53,532 --> 0:1:58,4
Are you looking for Kevin?


48
0:1:58,4 --> 0:2:0,501
Sure, unless you want
to hang out.


49
0:2:0,501 --> 0:2:8,639
He's upstairs.


50
0:2:8,639 --> 0:2:10,573
Hey, dad, do you want
to take me shopping?


51
0:2:10,573 --> 0:2:11,573
No.


52
0:2:11,573 --> 0:2:13,74
Thanks for nothing.


53
0:2:13,74 --> 0:2:15,676
Hey, Gigi,
have you seen my mom?


54
0:2:15,676 --> 0:2:17,411
She's with a client.
Why?


55
0:2:17,411 --> 0:2:18,977
'Cause I want her
to take me to the mall


56
0:2:18,977 --> 0:2:20,411
so I can buy
these diamond earrings


57
0:2:20,411 --> 0:2:21,679
I've been saving up for.


58
0:2:21,679 --> 0:2:23,346
They cost $50.


59
0:2:23,346 --> 0:2:25,746
$50?
Yup.


60
0:2:25,746 --> 0:2:28,414
Oh, baby, those are
your starter diamonds.


61
0:2:28,414 --> 0:2:30,483
I'm not doing anything.
I'll take you.


62
0:2:30,483 --> 0:2:33,851
Really?
Yes.


63
0:2:33,851 --> 0:2:36,387
$50 diamonds.
Exactly.


64
0:2:36,387 --> 0:2:38,955
That is so cute.


65
0:2:38,955 --> 0:2:40,29
Look what I got.


66
0:2:40,29 --> 0:2:41,824
Cool!


67
0:2:41,824 --> 0:2:43,192
What's his name?


68
0:2:43,192 --> 0:2:44,593
He doesn't have one.


69
0:2:44,593 --> 0:2:46,661
But you can give him one,
if you want.


70
0:2:46,661 --> 0:2:49,295
How about...Whitey?


71
0:2:49,295 --> 0:2:50,328
I guess.


72
0:2:50,328 --> 0:2:52,795
It's a bit obvious,
but it works.


73
0:2:52,795 --> 0:2:54,295
You want to keep him for a day?


74
0:2:54,295 --> 0:2:56,897
I can't.
My dad's afraid of rats.


75
0:2:56,897 --> 0:2:58,631
Just keep him in your drawer.


76
0:2:58,631 --> 0:3:0,265
Your dad'll never find him...


77
0:3:0,265 --> 0:3:3,134
Unless he looks in the drawer.


78
0:3:3,134 --> 0:3:14,476
Good idea.


79
0:3:14,476 --> 0:3:17,111
I wish I lived in a drawer.


80
0:3:17,111 --> 0:3:18,245
Well, I gotta go.


81
0:3:18,245 --> 0:3:27,883
My mom thinks
I'm in the bathtub.


82
0:3:27,883 --> 0:3:31,86
Your eyes are really pink.


83
0:3:31,86 --> 0:3:33,921
Little bed...


84
0:3:33,921 --> 0:3:35,889
Hey, dad.


85
0:3:35,889 --> 0:3:37,657
Whatcha doing in here?


86
0:3:37,657 --> 0:3:39,91
I need
a stronger WI-fi signal,


87
0:3:39,91 --> 0:3:41,492
so I'm going to install
this router in your closet.


88
0:3:41,492 --> 0:3:43,994
Oh, do you know how long
you're gonna be in there?


89
0:3:43,994 --> 0:3:45,862
Why? Is there someplace else
you want me to be?


90
0:3:45,862 --> 0:3:46,963
No.


91
0:3:46,963 --> 0:3:48,498
I was wondering if you'd,
you know,


92
0:3:48,498 --> 0:3:50,66
be in there a long time or not,


93
0:3:50,66 --> 0:4:3,973
just in case
somebody was looking for you.


94
0:4:3,973 --> 0:4:5,974
What was that?
What?


95
0:4:5,974 --> 0:4:8,8
I thought I heard
a scratching noise.


96
0:4:8,8 --> 0:4:10,81
Oh, that was me.
My skin's all dry.


97
0:4:10,81 --> 0:4:12,746
Mom keeps taking my lotion.


98
0:4:12,746 --> 0:4:15,14
What is it with the two of you
and lotion?


99
0:4:15,14 --> 0:4:16,815
Is that why
you don't want me in here?


100
0:4:16,815 --> 0:4:18,183
No, no.


101
0:4:18,183 --> 0:4:21,486
Just, my skin's all dry.


102
0:4:21,486 --> 0:4:22,72
Try taking a bath.


103
0:4:22,72 --> 0:4:24,956
That'll get rid of the funk
and the itch.


104
0:4:24,956 --> 0:4:28,925
Good idea.


105
0:4:28,925 --> 0:4:32,662
Bye.


106
0:4:32,662 --> 0:4:35,498
That was close.


107
0:4:35,498 --> 0:4:37,99
Whitey.


108
0:4:37,99 --> 0:4:46,663
Whitey!
Whitey?


109
0:4:46,663 --> 0:4:49,8
Not the pimp walk.


110
0:4:49,8 --> 0:4:51,601
Is that enough bars for you?


111
0:4:51,601 --> 0:4:52,869
Internet in the car.


112
0:4:52,869 --> 0:4:54,637
I am impressed.


113
0:4:54,637 --> 0:4:57,573
But my question is,
does it work in the house?


114
0:4:57,573 --> 0:4:59,441
Excuse me.
Excuse me.


115
0:4:59,441 --> 0:5:2,277
I got something to show you
right here.


116
0:5:2,277 --> 0:5:3,979
Bam!


117
0:5:3,979 --> 0:5:7,849
If you're working
on the couch...


118
0:5:7,849 --> 0:5:9,583
You are connected.


119
0:5:9,583 --> 0:5:12,285
If you're working
on the counter,


120
0:5:12,285 --> 0:5:16,289
you're connected.


121
0:5:16,289 --> 0:5:23,62
If...You do...The robot
in the dining room...


122
0:5:23,62 --> 0:5:27,532
You are fully connected.


123
0:5:27,532 --> 0:5:32,703
With bars like this,
you might get fully connected.


124
0:5:32,703 --> 0:5:43,12
Ooh, you're sexy
when you drop your firewall.


125
0:5:43,12 --> 0:5:45,147
Hey, Troy.
Come on in.


126
0:5:45,147 --> 0:5:47,316
Hi, Mr. Kingston-persons.


127
0:5:47,316 --> 0:5:48,817
Hi, Mrs. Kingston-persons.


128
0:5:48,817 --> 0:5:50,718
Hi, Troy.
Kevin's upstairs.


129
0:5:50,718 --> 0:5:57,857
I like the way
you read my mind.


130
0:5:57,857 --> 0:5:59,659
Hey, mom.
Hey, dad.


131
0:5:59,659 --> 0:6:1,562
Hi, sweetheart.
You been shopping?


132
0:6:1,562 --> 0:6:4,328
Yes.
Yes, I have.


133
0:6:4,328 --> 0:6:5,596
Oh, I'm going
to get out of here


134
0:6:5,596 --> 0:6:13,535
before all the,
"oh, that's so cute!"


135
0:6:13,535 --> 0:6:15,404
Look at this, mom.


136
0:6:15,404 --> 0:6:16,471
Bam!


137
0:6:16,471 --> 0:6:19,34
Oh, that's so cute.


138
0:6:19,34 --> 0:6:20,807
Look at this.


139
0:6:20,807 --> 0:6:22,608
Bam!


140
0:6:22,608 --> 0:6:24,81
Oh, and that's not all.


141
0:6:24,81 --> 0:6:26,311
Look.


142
0:6:26,311 --> 0:6:27,678
Bam!


143
0:6:27,678 --> 0:6:30,247
Lindsey, where'd you get
the money for all this?


144
0:6:30,247 --> 0:6:31,582
Oh, I ran into
an old boyfriend,


145
0:6:31,582 --> 0:6:33,884
and we tried to shake him,
but we couldn't.


146
0:6:33,884 --> 0:6:35,518
So we let him buy us
a bunch of stuff.


147
0:6:35,518 --> 0:6:37,352
You're telling me


148
0:6:37,352 --> 0:6:39,854
you let some man buy Lindsey
all these things?


149
0:6:39,854 --> 0:6:42,156
Oh, and my earrings,
and I still have my 50 bucks.


150
0:6:42,156 --> 0:6:45,224
Lindsey, I don't want you
becoming one of those women


151
0:6:45,224 --> 0:6:47,926
who accepts gifts
from strange men.


152
0:6:47,926 --> 0:6:48,894
But, mom--


153
0:6:48,894 --> 0:6:50,395
no buts.
Please go to your room.


154
0:6:50,395 --> 0:6:57,57
Gigi and I need to talk.


155
0:6:57,57 --> 0:6:59,38
Where do you think he went?


156
0:6:59,38 --> 0:7:0,5
I don't know.


157
0:7:0,5 --> 0:7:1,173
He was in my drawer,


158
0:7:1,173 --> 0:7:3,175
and then three seconds later,
he was gone.


159
0:7:3,175 --> 0:7:6,779
Dude, you've still got
race car underwear?


160
0:7:6,779 --> 0:7:8,481
What are you, nine?


161
0:7:8,481 --> 0:7:10,383
Troy, we've got to find
Whitey.


162
0:7:10,383 --> 0:7:13,418
If my dad sees him,
somebody's going to end up dead.


163
0:7:13,418 --> 0:7:16,655
I don't know if it's going to be
him, us, or the rat.


164
0:7:16,655 --> 0:7:19,358
All this talk of rats
is making me hungry.


165
0:7:19,358 --> 0:7:24,496
Does your mom have
pita pockets?


166
0:7:24,496 --> 0:7:27,33
Zee, I don't know
why you're so upset.


167
0:7:27,33 --> 0:7:29,332
My daughter just got
a bunch of free stuff


168
0:7:29,332 --> 0:7:30,333
from some man.


169
0:7:30,333 --> 0:7:32,201
It wasn't just some man.


170
0:7:32,201 --> 0:7:35,168
He was a man I know
who likes me, who I don't like,


171
0:7:35,168 --> 0:7:38,27
who's trying to convince me
to like him by buying me stuff.


172
0:7:38,27 --> 0:7:41,406
I don't think there's
anything strange about that.


173
0:7:41,406 --> 0:7:43,607
I don't want Lindsey thinking
that's how life works.


174
0:7:43,607 --> 0:7:45,375
That is how life works!


175
0:7:45,375 --> 0:7:47,61
That's what's so great
about being a...


176
0:7:47,61 --> 0:7:50,478
Woman.


177
0:7:50,478 --> 0:7:52,649
How about she uses
her other assets


178
0:7:52,649 --> 0:7:54,62
to get what she wants,
like her brain?


179
0:7:54,62 --> 0:7:58,323
Stupid women do not get
free Prada bags.


180
0:7:58,323 --> 0:7:59,625
Gigi.


181
0:7:59,625 --> 0:8:1,661
I don't want Lindsey doing
what you're doing.


182
0:8:1,661 --> 0:8:4,664
I'm not raising her
to be dependent on men.


183
0:8:4,664 --> 0:8:7,533
Is you accepting flowers
any different


184
0:8:7,533 --> 0:8:9,902
from me accepting a trip
to Puerto Rico?


185
0:8:9,902 --> 0:8:11,47
Yes.


186
0:8:11,47 --> 0:8:13,67
In principle.


187
0:8:13,67 --> 0:8:17,74
Okay, are you independent?


188
0:8:17,74 --> 0:8:19,876
Did you buy this house
by yourself?


189
0:8:19,876 --> 0:8:22,778
Are you raising your kids
by yourself?


190
0:8:22,778 --> 0:8:24,179
And you know what?


191
0:8:24,179 --> 0:8:26,514
I am not the one
who goes running to her man


192
0:8:26,514 --> 0:8:30,218
every time she can't get
a signal on her computer.


193
0:8:30,218 --> 0:8:31,285
No, you run to the mall


194
0:8:31,285 --> 0:8:33,621
and let a man buy you
a new computer.


195
0:8:33,621 --> 0:8:38,458
That was one time!


196
0:8:38,458 --> 0:8:40,66
Are you saying
I'm a bad influence?


197
0:8:40,66 --> 0:8:42,661
Yes.


198
0:8:42,661 --> 0:8:45,997
I guess
that's what I'm saying.


199
0:8:45,997 --> 0:8:47,198
You know what?


200
0:8:47,198 --> 0:8:49,99
I don't need
some holier-than-thou friend


201
0:8:49,99 --> 0:8:51,668
judging me on what I do.


202
0:8:51,668 --> 0:8:55,139
'Cause I'm a good person,
Suzanne!


203
0:8:55,139 --> 0:9:27,428
I am not the hypocrite!


204
0:9:27,428 --> 0:9:31,664
Hey, Kevin!


205
0:9:31,664 --> 0:9:34,7
Be cool.
Be cool. Be cool.


206
0:9:34,7 --> 0:9:36,835
Hey, Mr. Kingston-persons.


207
0:9:36,835 --> 0:9:38,3
The Internet is down.


208
0:9:38,3 --> 0:9:39,737
You boys been messing
with the wires?


209
0:9:39,737 --> 0:9:43,406
No.


210
0:9:43,406 --> 0:9:45,108
Can you fix this later?


211
0:9:45,108 --> 0:9:47,777
We were just about to watch
an episode of <i>Mojo Joe.</i>


212
0:9:47,777 --> 0:9:50,58
How you going to watch it
if the Internet is down?


213
0:9:50,58 --> 0:9:53,682
That's okay.
I gotta go anyway.


214
0:9:53,682 --> 0:10:4,726
My mom thinks I'm with the nanny
at the grocery store.


215
0:10:4,726 --> 0:10:6,762
Hey!


216
0:10:6,762 --> 0:10:8,464
What is the matter?


217
0:10:8,464 --> 0:10:23,9
We have a rat!


218
0:10:23,9 --> 0:10:27,559
Nick, it's a rat,
she'lnot Al-Qaeda.Ikes greet


219
0:10:27,559 --> 0:10:29,327
those traps I set out
last night?


220
0:10:29,327 --> 0:10:30,294
All tripped.


221
0:10:30,294 --> 0:10:31,996
That rat is playing tricks
on me.


222
0:10:31,996 --> 0:10:34,131
Yeah, well, you're not
the only one with a problem.


223
0:10:34,131 --> 0:10:35,599
Gigi's not speaking to me.


224
0:10:35,599 --> 0:10:37,901
I don't even know
if she's showing up for work.


225
0:10:37,901 --> 0:10:39,469
I know I'm not.


226
0:10:39,469 --> 0:10:41,103
I'm taking a rat day.


227
0:10:41,103 --> 0:10:43,871
I mean, Gigi crossed
the line, didn't she?


228
0:10:43,871 --> 0:10:45,373
She can do whatever she wants.


229
0:10:45,373 --> 0:10:48,42
I just don't want her doing it
in front of our daughter.


230
0:10:48,42 --> 0:10:50,312
Does our daughter know there's
a rat loose in the house?


231
0:10:50,312 --> 0:10:51,78
Oh, she doesn't care.


232
0:10:51,78 --> 0:10:53,982
She's probably dreaming
of her next trip to the mall.


233
0:10:53,982 --> 0:10:56,51
She better watch out
for those mall rats.


234
0:10:56,51 --> 0:10:57,553
Nick.


235
0:10:57,553 --> 0:10:58,587
Shh, shh, shh!


236
0:10:58,587 --> 0:11:2,123
You hear that?


237
0:11:2,123 --> 0:11:6,659
Oh, my God.


238
0:11:6,659 --> 0:11:10,427
Will you please stop worrying
about the stupid rat?


239
0:11:10,427 --> 0:11:12,227
Baby, rats are not stupid.


240
0:11:12,227 --> 0:11:14,629
Did you know they're not
indigenous to the United States?


241
0:11:14,629 --> 0:11:15,897
They come from Norway.


242
0:11:15,897 --> 0:11:19,4
You cannot be stupid
and get to Seattle from Norway.


243
0:11:19,4 --> 0:11:30,812
Rats are everywhere,
like Carmen Sandiego.


244
0:11:30,812 --> 0:11:33,748
Nick.


245
0:11:33,748 --> 0:11:35,649
Nick!


246
0:11:35,649 --> 0:11:37,918
I am in the middle of a crisis


247
0:11:37,918 --> 0:11:40,353
with my best friend
and our daughter,


248
0:11:40,353 --> 0:11:43,256
and you're on a ladder,
hiding from a rat.


249
0:11:43,256 --> 0:11:44,958
Gigi did what Gigi does.


250
0:11:44,958 --> 0:11:46,259
You know how she is.


251
0:11:46,259 --> 0:11:47,359
I guess.


252
0:11:47,359 --> 0:11:48,927
I just didn't expect her
to be that way


253
0:11:48,927 --> 0:11:50,594
in front of Lindsey.


254
0:11:50,594 --> 0:11:52,46
Look, Lindsey's a smart girl.


255
0:11:52,46 --> 0:11:54,295
Just because she got
a free pair of sunglasses


256
0:11:54,295 --> 0:11:55,93
doesn't mean
she's going to end up


257
0:11:55,93 --> 0:11:57,498
like Lindsay Lohan
or Paris Hilton


258
0:11:57,498 --> 0:11:59,599
or Britney spears--
you know, white women.


259
0:11:59,599 --> 0:12:2,535
Have faith in our daughter.


260
0:12:2,535 --> 0:12:5,671
That's all you got?
"Have faith"?


261
0:12:5,671 --> 0:12:8,541
Oh, are those rat droppings?


262
0:12:8,541 --> 0:12:10,542
Oh, that stuff is deadly.


263
0:12:10,542 --> 0:12:12,844
You could get leptospirosis,
salmonellosis,


264
0:12:12,844 --> 0:12:14,712
trichinosis, tuberculosis.


265
0:12:14,712 --> 0:12:18,48
You can also get a broom
and sweep it up.


266
0:12:18,48 --> 0:12:21,849
Baby, can you get me a broom?


267
0:12:21,849 --> 0:12:25,153
Why don't you just have faith
that the rat won't bite


268
0:12:25,153 --> 0:12:26,421
and get the broom yourself?


269
0:12:26,421 --> 0:12:28,256
Funny.


270
0:12:28,256 --> 0:12:30,726
Come on, baby.
Get me the broom.


271
0:12:30,726 --> 0:12:32,294
Baby.


272
0:12:32,294 --> 0:12:34,229
Babe!


273
0:12:34,229 --> 0:12:46,205
Suzanne!


274
0:12:46,205 --> 0:12:48,607
Your perimeter is clear.


275
0:12:48,607 --> 0:12:51,42
When was the last time
you seen him?


276
0:12:51,42 --> 0:12:53,378
Well, technically,
I haven't seen him,


277
0:12:53,378 --> 0:12:54,446
but I know he's here.


278
0:12:54,446 --> 0:12:56,581
How do you know?


279
0:12:56,581 --> 0:12:59,116
There were bite marks
in my router cables.


280
0:12:59,116 --> 0:13:1,785
And you believe this
to be a rat.


281
0:13:1,785 --> 0:13:4,82
It was either that
or the Indian in the cupboard.


282
0:13:4,82 --> 0:13:6,254
Indian in the cupboard.


283
0:13:6,254 --> 0:13:7,588
Man, I love that movie.


284
0:13:7,588 --> 0:13:9,56
Didn't it have
a little Indian in it?


285
0:13:9,56 --> 0:13:10,23
Yeah, and a little bear.


286
0:13:10,23 --> 0:13:11,158
And the rats tried
to get him.


287
0:13:11,158 --> 0:13:12,559
That was terrifying,
right there.


288
0:13:12,559 --> 0:13:13,96
Look, that's why
I'm telling you:


289
0:13:13,96 --> 0:13:15,361
This thing is smart, man.


290
0:13:15,361 --> 0:13:16,729
Look, I set traps out
last night,


291
0:13:16,729 --> 0:13:18,598
and this morning,
they were all tripped.


292
0:13:18,598 --> 0:13:20,633
That tells me
it was more than one.


293
0:13:20,633 --> 0:13:22,68
Look, I saw this
on Nat Geo.


294
0:13:22,68 --> 0:13:24,97
Did you know that rats can meet,
court, and mate


295
0:13:24,97 --> 0:13:26,838
in less than 3 1/2 seconds?


296
0:13:26,838 --> 0:13:30,775
That's almost as fast
as the Kardashians.


297
0:13:30,775 --> 0:13:33,644
I hate to say this.
Man, I can't help you.


298
0:13:33,644 --> 0:13:35,412
Your whole house
has been compromised.


299
0:13:35,412 --> 0:13:36,713
Now, look.


300
0:13:36,713 --> 0:13:39,482
If we don't find this rat
in the next 24 hours,


301
0:13:39,482 --> 0:13:40,783
it's going to be hell to pay.


302
0:13:40,783 --> 0:13:42,685
I got to get
some heavy artillery.


303
0:13:42,685 --> 0:13:43,919
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!


304
0:13:43,919 --> 0:13:46,688
Look, you got a gun, man.
What else do you need?


305
0:13:46,688 --> 0:13:48,156
Do you think
this little, bitty gun


306
0:13:48,156 --> 0:13:50,825
is going to kill a city rat?


307
0:13:50,825 --> 0:13:52,892
You got a lot to learn.


308
0:13:52,892 --> 0:13:56,661
What's that?


309
0:13:56,661 --> 0:14:6,69
Man, I hate it
when he does that.


310
0:14:6,69 --> 0:14:7,804
Hey, Lindsey.


311
0:14:7,804 --> 0:14:8,838
What you got?


312
0:14:8,838 --> 0:14:10,38
String cheese.


313
0:14:10,38 --> 0:14:11,272
Careful not to drop any.


314
0:14:11,272 --> 0:14:13,109
You know there's a rat loose
in the house.


315
0:14:13,109 --> 0:14:16,282
Ew, gross, dad.
You know I hate rats.


316
0:14:16,282 --> 0:14:19,22
That's what I'm talking about.


317
0:14:19,22 --> 0:14:21,355
So what's going on
with you and your mom?


318
0:14:21,355 --> 0:14:22,657
She thinks I'm a tramp


319
0:14:22,657 --> 0:14:25,628
because some strange guy
bought me some sunglasses.


320
0:14:25,628 --> 0:14:27,997
She doesn't think
you're a tramp.


321
0:14:27,997 --> 0:14:29,498
She doesn't want you
accepting gifts


322
0:14:29,498 --> 0:14:30,9
from men you don't know.


323
0:14:30,9 --> 0:14:32,301
Neither do I.


324
0:14:32,301 --> 0:14:33,869
Duh.


325
0:14:33,869 --> 0:14:35,47
Don't you think I know that?


326
0:14:35,47 --> 0:14:38,94
Besides, that's an epic fail.


327
0:14:38,94 --> 0:14:40,208
So what'd you get, anyway?


328
0:14:40,208 --> 0:14:42,444
It's in the dining room.
You want to see it?


329
0:14:42,444 --> 0:14:44,45
Can you bring it in here?


330
0:14:44,45 --> 0:15:8,231
Nope.


331
0:15:8,231 --> 0:15:10,333
Wow, those look expensive.


332
0:15:10,333 --> 0:15:12,2
How much were they?


333
0:15:12,2 --> 0:15:16,506
I don't know.


334
0:15:16,506 --> 0:15:17,54
Rat!


335
0:15:17,54 --> 0:15:20,476
Run, Lindsey, run!


336
0:15:20,476 --> 0:15:49,901
Go, go, go!


337
0:15:49,901 --> 0:15:51,771
Don't look at me like that,
Chuck.


338
0:15:51,771 --> 0:15:53,306
We all have our fears.


339
0:15:53,306 --> 0:15:54,573
I'm afraid of rats,


340
0:15:54,573 --> 0:15:57,76
and obviously you're afraid
of championships.


341
0:15:57,76 --> 0:15:58,143
Hey, Nick.


342
0:15:58,143 --> 0:15:59,912
Marty!


343
0:15:59,912 --> 0:16:1,581
Don't sneak up on me
like that, man.


344
0:16:1,581 --> 0:16:3,483
I didn't.


345
0:16:3,483 --> 0:16:4,651
What the hell is wrong with you?


346
0:16:4,651 --> 0:16:7,119
Man, I can't work.
I can't sleep.


347
0:16:7,119 --> 0:16:8,954
I'm jumpy, edgy.


348
0:16:8,954 --> 0:16:10,723
Another fight
with the missus, huh?


349
0:16:10,723 --> 0:16:11,957
No, we didn't get
into a fight.


350
0:16:11,957 --> 0:16:16,6
There's a rat loose
in the house.


351
0:16:16,6 --> 0:16:17,929
Did you know one pair of rats
can shed


352
0:16:17,929 --> 0:16:19,631
over a million body hairs
each year?


353
0:16:19,631 --> 0:16:21,965
Rats' front teeth
never stop growing.


354
0:16:21,965 --> 0:16:23,333
And if they don't gnaw
on things,


355
0:16:23,333 --> 0:16:25,267
the teeth can get
up to five inches long.


356
0:16:25,267 --> 0:16:28,136
A rat can enter any space
a half an inch wide.


357
0:16:28,136 --> 0:16:31,105
And they can swim as far
as a half mile in open water.


358
0:16:31,105 --> 0:16:32,806
A rat can drop 50 feet
without injury.


359
0:16:32,806 --> 0:16:36,476
They have a 36-inch
vertical jump.


360
0:16:36,476 --> 0:16:39,412
So that means if a rat fell
out of a plane


361
0:16:39,412 --> 0:16:42,248
into the ocean
a half a mile away from me


362
0:16:42,248 --> 0:16:44,83
and I was on an island
up in a tree,


363
0:16:44,83 --> 0:16:47,42
sealed up in a box with only
a half-inch opening for air,


364
0:16:47,42 --> 0:16:52,358
that rat could still get in
and kill me?


365
0:16:52,358 --> 0:16:57,196
Martin!
Martin!


366
0:16:57,196 --> 0:17:12,819
Oh, my God.


367
0:17:12,819 --> 0:17:14,121
Were you this mad at me?


368
0:17:14,121 --> 0:17:17,424
You took all my hard work
and threw it on the floor?


369
0:17:17,424 --> 0:17:19,158
Yes, I was this mad at you.


370
0:17:19,158 --> 0:17:20,56
But no, I didn't do this.


371
0:17:20,56 --> 0:17:21,961
Nick thought he saw a rat.


372
0:17:21,961 --> 0:17:23,462
Well, what was he going
but no, I dito do,o this.


373
0:17:23,462 --> 0:17:28,33
Embarrass it to death
by making it wear these shoes?


374
0:17:28,33 --> 0:17:29,367
Oh, I'm sorry.


375
0:17:29,367 --> 0:17:30,935
Maybe you don't need my help


376
0:17:30,935 --> 0:17:32,503
because you're
an independent woman


377
0:17:32,503 --> 0:17:33,837
who can do everything herself.


378
0:17:33,837 --> 0:17:35,639
You don't mean that, do you?
No.


379
0:17:35,639 --> 0:17:37,7
And I didn't mean it


380
0:17:37,7 --> 0:17:38,342
when I said that you were
a bad influence.


381
0:17:38,342 --> 0:17:39,409
And I didn't mean it
when I said


382
0:17:39,409 --> 0:17:40,51
you always run to men for help.


383
0:17:40,51 --> 0:17:41,945
And I didn't mean it
when I said


384
0:17:41,945 --> 0:17:43,514
that you weren't good enough
to be around my daughter.


385
0:17:43,514 --> 0:17:45,316
Well, technically, you didn't
say that; I said that.


386
0:17:45,316 --> 0:17:47,451
Yeah, but I let you say it,
and I didn't say anything.


387
0:17:47,451 --> 0:17:48,986
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.


388
0:17:48,986 --> 0:17:51,122
I love you.


389
0:17:51,122 --> 0:17:54,224
I love you.
I love you too.


390
0:17:54,224 --> 0:17:56,694
And, zee zee,
you should know me by now.


391
0:17:56,694 --> 0:17:58,83
I don't do anything
I don't want to do.


392
0:17:58,83 --> 0:18:1,433
Men do nice things for me
for different reasons,


393
0:18:1,433 --> 0:18:3,235
and just because I don't agree
with the reason


394
0:18:3,235 --> 0:18:4,97
doesn't mean
I shouldn't benefit.


395
0:18:4,97 --> 0:18:6,638
I know;
I just don't want Lindsey


396
0:18:6,638 --> 0:18:9,473
to end up like Paris Hilton
or Lindsay Lohan


397
0:18:9,473 --> 0:18:15,311
or Britney spears--
you know, white women.


398
0:18:15,311 --> 0:18:17,746
Lindsey is going to grow up
and be a beautiful woman.


399
0:18:17,746 --> 0:18:19,448
She's going to have to learn
what to take,


400
0:18:19,448 --> 0:18:26,854
what not to take, when and why
and why not to take it.


401
0:18:26,854 --> 0:18:28,889
Hi, sweetheart.
Hey, mom.


402
0:18:28,889 --> 0:18:30,624
Can you return these for me?


403
0:18:30,624 --> 0:18:31,825
Why?


404
0:18:31,825 --> 0:18:33,727
Because I wanted to buy
my own earrings.


405
0:18:33,727 --> 0:18:36,229
Oh, and here's 50 bucks.


406
0:18:36,229 --> 0:18:37,464
No, you don't have to do that.


407
0:18:37,464 --> 0:18:39,165
I know, but I want to.


408
0:18:39,165 --> 0:18:42,934
Well, that is very independent
of you.


409
0:18:42,934 --> 0:18:43,968
Thank you.


410
0:18:43,968 --> 0:18:45,737
Sweetheart, you know,


411
0:18:45,737 --> 0:18:48,5
if you want to keep
the glasses and the wallet,


412
0:18:48,5 --> 0:18:49,6
you can.


413
0:18:49,6 --> 0:18:50,874
Really?
Yeah.


414
0:18:50,874 --> 0:18:54,41
Well, actually, I really
don't like the wallet that much.


415
0:18:54,41 --> 0:18:59,414
So you can take that one back.


416
0:18:59,414 --> 0:19:1,582
What are you doing
with my money?


417
0:19:1,582 --> 0:19:3,617
You didn't buy those earrings,


418
0:19:3,617 --> 0:19:9,49
and I need something
to put in my new wallet.


419
0:19:9,49 --> 0:19:12,492
Did you know rats have
incredible physical memory?


420
0:19:12,492 --> 0:19:14,493
They always retrace their steps.


421
0:19:14,493 --> 0:19:16,762
Where was the last place
you saw him?


422
0:19:16,762 --> 0:19:18,597
In my drawer.


423
0:19:18,597 --> 0:19:20,399
Did you check there?


424
0:19:20,399 --> 0:19:21,601
"Did you check there?"


425
0:19:21,601 --> 0:19:27,406
Did <i>you</i> check there?


426
0:19:27,406 --> 0:19:32,8
Whitey!


427
0:19:32,8 --> 0:19:33,843
Do you know
what rats are capable of?


428
0:19:33,843 --> 0:19:35,878
A lot of people think
rats are stupid.


429
0:19:35,878 --> 0:19:39,81
But you don't get from Norway
to Seattle by being stupid.


430
0:19:39,81 --> 0:19:40,216
I know!


431
0:19:40,216 --> 0:19:41,25
Okay, you ready?


432
0:19:41,25 --> 0:19:42,651
Yeah.
All right, let's hit it.


433
0:19:42,651 --> 0:19:44,253
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.


434
0:19:44,253 --> 0:19:45,922
Take this.


435
0:19:45,922 --> 0:19:47,29
What's this?


436
0:19:47,29 --> 0:19:48,626
That's a letter to Suzanne.


437
0:19:48,626 --> 0:19:51,728
If anything should happen to me,
make sure she gets it.


438
0:19:51,728 --> 0:19:56,1
Oh, yeah,
you might not make it, huh?


439
0:19:56,1 --> 0:19:58,69
I'll tell her.


440
0:19:58,69 --> 0:19:59,704
Okay, on my call, all right?


441
0:19:59,704 --> 0:20:0,671
Ready.


442
0:20:0,671 --> 0:20:2,306
One, two, three.


443
0:20:2,306 --> 0:20:3,34
Let's hit it.


444
0:20:3,34 --> 0:20:4,575
I said hit it and quit it!


445
0:20:4,575 --> 0:20:6,76
No, you can't kill Whitey!


446
0:20:6,76 --> 0:20:7,345
He's Troy's pet rat!


447
0:20:7,345 --> 0:20:9,447
No, he's not.
What?


448
0:20:9,447 --> 0:20:11,716
It's not a pet rat.
It's a food rat.


449
0:20:11,716 --> 0:20:13,651
Little boy, you was going
to eat that rat?


450
0:20:13,651 --> 0:20:16,187
I remember when I had
my first rat.


451
0:20:16,187 --> 0:20:18,589
I was in the jungle
of Indonesia.


452
0:20:18,589 --> 0:20:21,626
I took it down
with a glass of Agent orange.


453
0:20:21,626 --> 0:20:23,561
I wasn't gonna eat it.


454
0:20:23,561 --> 0:20:26,597
I bought it to feed
my Uncle's pet python.


455
0:20:26,597 --> 0:20:28,432
Kevin, why would you bring
that rat in here,


456
0:20:28,432 --> 0:20:29,5
knowing I'm scared of them?


457
0:20:29,5 --> 0:20:30,634
I'm sorry, dad.


458
0:20:30,634 --> 0:20:32,169
I wasn't thinking.


459
0:20:32,169 --> 0:20:33,938
You do realize I'm only ten.


460
0:20:33,938 --> 0:20:35,906
Well, I gotta go.


461
0:20:35,906 --> 0:20:40,376
The snake's starting
to get hungry.


462
0:20:40,376 --> 0:20:42,913
So you're just gonna let him
feed Whitey to a snake.


463
0:20:42,913 --> 0:20:45,182
Yeah.
You saw <i>lion king.</i>


464
0:20:45,182 --> 0:20:46,683
It's the circle of life, dude.


465
0:20:46,683 --> 0:20:50,578
Yup, <i>hakuna matata.</i>


466
0:20:50,578 --> 0:20:51,188
What's that?


467
0:20:51,188 --> 0:20:52,508
What?


468
0:20:52,508 --> 0:22:52,508
