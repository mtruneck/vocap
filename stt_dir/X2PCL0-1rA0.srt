GEORGE H.W. BUSH: And let us remember that
the state of the union depends on each and


2
0:0:19,789 --> 0:0:20,74
everyone of us.


3
0:0:20,74 --> 0:0:26,65
BILL CLINTON: My fellow Americans, the state
of our union is the strongest it has ever


4
0:0:26,65 --> 0:0:26,96
been.


5
0:0:26,96 --> 0:0:30,26
GEORGE W. BUSH: And the state of our union
will remain strong.


6
0:0:30,26 --> 0:0:32,46
BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA: And the state of our union is


7
0:0:32,46 --> 0:0:33,329
strong.

CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: "He shall, from time
to time give to the Congress information on


10
0:0:43,61 --> 0:0:48,0
the state of the Union". Those words from
the U.S. Constitution are the reason why President


11
0:0:48,0 --> 0:0:52,44
Obama visited Capitol Hill last night. We
asked ahead of time what you wanted to hear


12
0:0:52,44 --> 0:0:57,21
the president talk about in his State of the
Union speech. Several of you brought up guns.


13
0:0:57,21 --> 0:1:1,69
We had some people who said they want to hear
about education issues, health care, immigration


14
0:1:1,69 --> 0:1:4,329
laws and of course, the economy.


15
0:1:4,329 --> 0:1:7,75
Some folks like Brian and Shira (ph) were
hoping to hear the president talk about bringing


16
0:1:7,75 --> 0:1:12,35
troops home from Afghanistan. That was part
of the president`s plan. Yesterday afternoon,


17
0:1:12,35 --> 0:1:17,6
CNN reported that the State of the Union would
include an announcement about 34,000 U.S.


18
0:1:17,6 --> 0:1:20,58
troops coming home from Afghanistan by next
February.

AZUZ: When a president gives the State of
the Union speech, the room is packed. Members


24
0:1:36,42 --> 0:1:40,4
of the U.S. House and Senate are there, members
of the U.S. Supreme Court, the Joint Chiefs


25
0:1:40,4 --> 0:1:44,82
of Staff, special guests. Here are some of
what President Obama said during his speech


26
0:1:44,82 --> 0:1:45,56
last night.

0:1:46,45 --> 0:1:46,75
(APPLAUSE)


29
0:1:46,75 --> 0:1:53,509
OBAMA: The American people don`t expect government
to solve every problem. They don`t expect


30
0:1:53,509 --> 0:2:0,42
those of us in this chamber to agree on every
issue. But they do expect us to put the nation`s


31
0:2:0,42 --> 0:2:12,4
interest before party.


32
0:2:12,4 --> 0:2:23,239
(APPLAUSE)


33
0:2:23,239 --> 0:2:29,549
They do expect us to forge reasonable compromise
where we can. For they know that America moves


34
0:2:29,549 --> 0:2:36,34
forward only when we do so together. And the
responsibility of improving this union remains


35
0:2:36,34 --> 0:2:38,59
the task of us all.

0:2:38,59 --> 0:2:38,719
(END VIDEO CLIP)


37
0:2:38,719 --> 0:2:42,859
AZUZ: We`ve got a video on our home page that
talks about some of the traditions surrounding


38
0:2:42,859 --> 0:2:47,559
the State of the Union. One of them is the
response from the opposition party. Last night,


39
0:2:47,559 --> 0:2:52,659
the Republican response was made by Marco
Rubio. He is U.S. Senator from Florida, and


40
0:2:52,659 --> 0:2:57,669
he`s seen as a rising star in the Republican
Party. A CNN political analyst who`s also


41
0:2:57,669 --> 0:3:2,629
one of Senator Rubio`s friends, said following
the State of the Union is the toughest gig


42
0:3:2,629 --> 0:3:6,279
in politics. Here`s part of Senator Rubio`s
speech from last night.

44
0:3:6,76 --> 0:3:9,919
SEN. MARCO RUBIO, (R ), FLORIDA: The idea
that more taxes and more government spending


45
0:3:9,919 --> 0:3:14,999
is the best way to help hardworking middle
class taxpayers? That`s an old idea that`s


46
0:3:14,999 --> 0:3:20,209
failed every time it`s been tried. More government
isn`t going to help you get ahead. It`s going


47
0:3:20,209 --> 0:3:25,1
to hold you back. More government isn`t going
to create more opportunities, it`s going to


48
0:3:25,1 --> 0:3:29,819
limit them. And more government isn`t going
to inspire new ideas, new businesses and new


49
0:3:29,819 --> 0:3:32,699
private sector jobs. It`s going to create
uncertainty.

Coast Middle School in Santa Rosa Beach, Florida.
Which of these words relates to vibrations


54
0:3:45,359 --> 0:3:53,769
in the earth? Here we go. Is it barometric,
seismic, orthopedic or antediluvian? You`ve


55
0:3:53,769 --> 0:3:57,499
got three seconds, go!


56
0:3:57,499 --> 0:4:5,529
A seismic event like an earthquake has to
do with earth vibrations. That`s your answer


57
0:4:5,529 --> 0:4:7,639
and that`s your "Shoutout."


58
0:4:7,639 --> 0:4:9,4
(END VIDEO CLIP)


59
0:4:9,4 --> 0:4:14,51
AZUZ: There were reports of seismic activity
in North Korea on Tuesday, but no one was


60
0:4:14,51 --> 0:4:19,78
talking about an earthquake. These vibrations
were caused by an underground nuclear test,


61
0:4:19,78 --> 0:4:24,669
one that sent shock waves around the world.
Leaders from all over the globe spoke out


62
0:4:24,669 --> 0:4:30,59
against North Korea. Even China, North Korea`s
closest ally, said it was opposed to this


63
0:4:30,59 --> 0:4:31,3
test.


64
0:4:31,3 --> 0:4:35,419
The United Nations Security Council held an
emergency meeting after North Korea announced


65
0:4:35,419 --> 0:4:40,62
this test. What happened yesterday, breaks
rules that the Security Council has for North


66
0:4:40,62 --> 0:4:45,419
Korea`s controversial nuclear program. Last
month, the council promised to take significant


67
0:4:45,419 --> 0:4:50,689
action, if there was another test. This is
North Korea`s first nuclear test since Kim-Jong


68
0:4:50,689 --> 0:4:54,849
Un took over as the country`s leader. The
North Korean government said the test was


69
0:4:54,849 --> 0:4:58,96
designed to "defend the country`s security
and sovereignty".

are camping out on the top deck.

(END VIDEO CLIP)


74
0:5:13,33 --> 0:5:18,669
AZUZ: Not a dream vacation. Three days into
a four-day Caribbean cruise, there was a fire


75
0:5:18,669 --> 0:5:24,12
in the engine room of the Carnival Triumph
cruise ship. That left more than 4200 passengers


76
0:5:24,12 --> 0:5:28,849
and crew drifting for days in the Gulf of
Mexico. You can see some of them in this Facebook


77
0:5:28,849 --> 0:5:34,58
photo. Rooms flooded, sewage leaked in some
areas. Two tug boats were needed to tow the


78
0:5:34,58 --> 0:5:40,319
ship, and Carnival sent in meals from other
crews ships. The Triumph could arrive in Mobile,


79
0:5:40,319 --> 0:5:45,199
Alabama today or tomorrow, passengers have
been promised a full refund, a free flight


80
0:5:45,199 --> 0:5:50,759
home and credit for another cruise. So, the
day`s question on our Facebook site is, would


81
0:5:50,759 --> 0:5:56,33
you take it? If you are on Facebook, you can
find us at Facebook.com/cnnstudentnews. And


82
0:5:56,33 --> 0:6:1,8
tell us if you`d been in a cruise ship situation
like this, if you`d be willing to take another


83
0:6:1,8 --> 0:6:1,469
one.

0:6:2,65 --> 0:6:8,159
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Is this legit? A cancer
patient who`s in remission doesn`t show signs


86
0:6:8,159 --> 0:6:15,81
of the disease. It`s true! The cancer could
come back, but complete remission means the


87
0:6:15,81 --> 0:6:18,69
signs and symptoms have disappeared.


88
0:6:18,69 --> 0:6:20,83
(END VIDEO CLIP)


89
0:6:20,83 --> 0:6:24,979
AZUZ: Earlier this month, we talked about
World Cancer Day. The goal this year was to


90
0:6:24,979 --> 0:6:30,699
tackle some myths, like that cancer is an
automatic death sentence. It`s not. In the


91
0:6:30,699 --> 0:6:34,62
U.S. one out of every two men and one out
of every three women will be diagnosed with


92
0:6:34,62 --> 0:6:39,53
some form of cancer. But finding it earlier
and better treatments may mean those cancer


93
0:6:39,53 --> 0:6:44,8
patients can and will go into remission. For
some people, that`s when a whole new kind


94
0:6:44,8 --> 0:6:45,819
of stress starts.

96
0:6:46,319 --> 0:6:49,37
JAMES CURRY, CNN INTERNATIONAL PRODUCER: My
name is James Curry, I`m a producer at CNN


97
0:6:49,37 --> 0:6:55,509
International. I`m 27 years old. And two years
ago, I was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin`s lymphoma.


98
0:6:55,509 --> 0:6:59,46
Cancer in most people`s mind is what affects
older people. When I was being treated, I`d


99
0:6:59,46 --> 0:7:4,11
go to the Cancer Center, people would ask
me - oh, are you waiting with somebody or


100
0:7:4,11 --> 0:7:7,31
whatever? And I`d be like no, I`m actually
getting treated for cancer.


101
0:7:7,31 --> 0:7:7,719
(LAUGHTER)


102
0:7:7,719 --> 0:7:14,499
CURRY: I went to the doctor for a simple sore
throat. Less than a week later, I was told


103
0:7:14,499 --> 0:7:17,879
that I had cancer, and went immediately into
chemotherapy.


104
0:7:17,879 --> 0:7:22,349
Chemotherapy was the worst experience of my
life. Hands down. Your worst hangover ever


105
0:7:22,349 --> 0:7:27,12
times a hundred, and then drink a bottle of
bleach - I mean that`s what chemo was like


106
0:7:27,12 --> 0:7:32,659
for four days. I went through chemotherapy
and then did eight weeks of radiation, and


107
0:7:32,659 --> 0:7:36,689
close to my birthday I was told that OK, you`re
finally in remission. Although you`re relieved


108
0:7:36,689 --> 0:7:41,689
that you`re in remission, there is that whole
anxiety that goes with it. Every doctor`s


109
0:7:41,689 --> 0:7:47,74
appointment, wondering, if you`re going to
be rediagnosed with cancer.


110
0:7:47,74 --> 0:7:54,319
Every month I go to the doctor. I go get blood
test, I get scans. And then I wait seven days.


111
0:7:54,319 --> 0:8:0,8
And I think it`s the worst seven days of my
life every month. They take my vital signs,


112
0:8:0,8 --> 0:8:3,699
and I try to act all cool, but the vital signs
always give you away.


113
0:8:3,699 --> 0:8:8,879
They hand me the test results, and it`s - I
treat it like a trophy or a diploma. It`s


114
0:8:8,879 --> 0:8:13,15
a kind of big deal, even though it`s really
just a crinkled piece of paper. But I save


115
0:8:13,15 --> 0:8:13,809
all of them.


116
0:8:13,809 --> 0:8:20,879
There`s relief, but then I go make that appointment
again, and it starts the whole process all


117
0:8:20,879 --> 0:8:22,58
over again.


118
0:8:22,58 --> 0:8:26,69
You definitely learn to value things more,
and I thought I learned that in the Marine


119
0:8:26,69 --> 0:8:30,689
Corps. Almost was killed in Iraq, and now
I come back and there`s a possibility I can


120
0:8:30,689 --> 0:8:32,39
die again from cancer.


121
0:8:32,39 --> 0:8:36,469
Ten year later, 70 people -- 70 percent of
people are not alive after their remission.


122
0:8:36,469 --> 0:8:39,699
You start thinking about death, you start
thinking about whether or not you want to


123
0:8:39,699 --> 0:8:40,669
go through treatment again.


124
0:8:40,669 --> 0:8:45,55
You have a pretty strong support system with
your friends and family, but really, I think


125
0:8:45,55 --> 0:8:49,87
it`s just something each person deals with
individually. You take one day at a time and


126
0:8:49,87 --> 0:8:53,44
try not to let it dominate your life. You`re
just trying to be normal.


127
0:8:53,44 --> 0:8:54,31
(END VIDEO CLIP)


128
0:8:54,31 --> 0:8:58,44
AZUZ: Fascinating story from my colleague
at CNN International. Before we go today,


129
0:8:58,44 --> 0:9:4,36
we have for you a little mascot mayhem. The
Bakersfield Condors, minor league hockey team,


130
0:9:4,36 --> 0:9:8,649
decided to bring out a real condor for the
national anthem recently. The bird seemed


131
0:9:8,649 --> 0:9:14,86
to draw inspiration from that "Land of the
Free" line. It escaped from its handler twice.


132
0:9:14,86 --> 0:9:20,42
Even though recovery didn`t go as planned
-- ouch -- remember, ice is slippery. The


133
0:9:20,42 --> 0:9:25,949
bird flocked to the Condors bench and eventually
made its way out of the arena. You know how


134
0:9:25,949 --> 0:9:30,94
it left? Through the condoor (ph). Sure, it`s
sort of bird brain story, but at least it


135
0:9:30,94 --> 0:11:30,94
has an ice ending.
