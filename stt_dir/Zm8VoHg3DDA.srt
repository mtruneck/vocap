-l guess l'm in the wrong room.
-You got that right.


83
0:9:37,49 --> 0:9:40,26
False flagger.


84
0:9:40,26 --> 0:9:42,695
l'm gonna show you
how we handle that little action.


85
0:9:42,695 --> 0:9:44,797
Bada-bing.


86
0:9:44,797 --> 0:9:58,444
Jump that false flagger down here to me.


87
0:9:58,444 --> 0:10:3,383
Get on your knees, motherfucker!


88
0:10:3,383 --> 0:10:4,651
This ass...


89
0:10:4,651 --> 0:10:7,32
...he tried to go over to the Vice Lords.


90
0:10:7,32 --> 0:10:10,29
But we got the bitch back.


91
0:10:10,29 --> 0:10:16,496
Been breaking him off a little
something-something for two days now.


92
0:10:16,496 --> 0:10:19,65
l ain't no false flagger.


93
0:10:19,65 --> 0:10:21,1

0:10:21,1 --> 0:10:22,168
Shit.

Hear somebody call out ''boss'', thought
the nigger knew me from the street.


96
0:10:26,372 --> 0:10:31,144
-They call me ''Boss Dog''.
-l didn't know they called Disciples ''boss''.


97
0:10:31,144 --> 0:10:44,557
-This shit is just a confusion, it's a mix-up.
-Let me handle this here.


98
0:10:44,557 --> 0:10:51,564
Stand up.


99
0:10:51,564 --> 0:10:56,836
Step the fuck up outta here.


100
0:10:56,836 --> 0:11:7,146
Raise out!

0:11:42,749 --> 0:11:44,817
Ta-dow.

You in the right room now
and you gonna need this here.


106
0:11:50,23 --> 0:11:53,993
They tell me they had you
over in the Disciples' room.


107
0:11:53,993 --> 0:11:57,96
You see one of our soldiers over there?


108
0:11:57,96 --> 0:11:58,664
Yeah.


109
0:11:58,664 --> 0:12:2,935
He still alive?


110
0:12:2,935 --> 0:12:8,908
lf you wanna call it that.


111
0:12:8,908 --> 0:12:11,21
You know they got us outnumbered.


112
0:12:11,21 --> 0:12:17,5
lt's about 75 of them,
only 20-something of us.


113
0:12:17,5 --> 0:12:24,257
They beat that man up
and stabbed that man over an orange.


114
0:12:24,257 --> 0:12:30,797
Over a goddamn orange.


115
0:12:30,797 --> 0:12:35,101
We gonna kill them motherfuckers.


116
0:12:35,101 --> 0:12:38,538
Y'all hear me?


117
0:12:38,538 --> 0:12:39,605
Yeah.


118
0:12:39,605 --> 0:12:46,212
We gonna move on in Disciples' ass today.


119
0:12:46,212 --> 0:12:57,39
Motherfucks.


120
0:12:57,39 --> 0:13:1,627
This shit ain't happening.


121
0:13:1,627 --> 0:13:4,63
Mama, no...no, it wasn't nothing.


122
0:13:4,63 --> 0:13:8,968
Shit, l didn't do nothing.


123
0:13:8,968 --> 0:13:13,739
Mama, it was a police sweep.
Picked up everybody on the block.


124
0:13:13,739 --> 0:13:18,544
lt didn't matter what you were doing
or not doing. l'm telling you.


125
0:13:18,544 --> 0:13:20,947
What?


126
0:13:20,947 --> 0:13:27,854
Yeah.


127
0:13:27,854 --> 0:13:39,632
Nigger--


128
0:13:39,632 --> 0:13:43,2
That there's some bullshit.
l won't go back to that damn place.


129
0:13:43,2 --> 0:13:44,971
You got to plea-bargain for me.


130
0:13:44,971 --> 0:13:48,574
l can't. You had over 5 grams on you.
That's trafficking.


131
0:13:48,574 --> 0:13:51,11
-You don't understand.
-No, you don't understand.


132
0:13:51,11 --> 0:13:54,8
They got motherfuckers in there
for chopping up their mama.


133
0:13:54,8 --> 0:13:57,25
They gonna put me in there
with murderers and rapists?


134
0:13:57,25 --> 0:13:59,719
Not one word out of you in court.
Understand?


135
0:13:59,719 --> 0:14:2,522
No, l don't understand. Look at me.


136
0:14:2,522 --> 0:14:6,125
You the public defender, you do your job
or l talk to the judge myself.


137
0:14:6,125 --> 0:14:9,795
No, you will not.
You will keep quiet and let me do my job.


138
0:14:9,795 --> 0:14:26,45
Just let me do the talking.
Now, come on. Go.


139
0:14:26,45 --> 0:14:32,852
Stand up.


140
0:14:32,852 --> 0:14:36,556
l have no choice but to assign you
the minimum mandatory sentence...


141
0:14:36,556 --> 0:14:40,993
...of five years without parole,
to an lllinois correctional facility...


142
0:14:40,993 --> 0:14:45,331
...according to Section 97,
Paragraph 3 of federal guidelines.


143
0:14:45,331 --> 0:14:49,502
Because this is your first offense,
pending qualification...


144
0:14:49,502 --> 0:14:53,105
...you will be given a choice
to serve an alternative sentence...


145
0:14:53,105 --> 0:15:12,725
...under the jurisdiction
of the prison boot camp program.


146
0:15:12,725 --> 0:15:14,427
This shit's a fucking joke.


147
0:15:14,427 --> 0:15:17,83
You did what you did
and now you got to pay.


148
0:15:17,83 --> 0:15:21,434
You think you can do whatever you want
and get away with it?


149
0:15:21,434 --> 0:15:24,537
Five years for my first offense?
That's bullshit there, Mama.


150
0:15:24,537 --> 0:15:26,339
What about this boot camp?


151
0:15:26,339 --> 0:15:27,873
l don't know.


152
0:15:27,873 --> 0:15:30,176
l heard it's out in the middle of nowhere.


153
0:15:30,176 --> 0:15:32,712
Guards yelling at you,
telling you to do pushups.


154
0:15:32,712 --> 0:15:36,882
Like the army. What's wrong with that?
lt'll give you discipline.


155
0:15:36,882 --> 0:15:39,952
l don't want my son
to go through five years of this.


156
0:15:39,952 --> 0:16:15,988
You get through that boot camp
and you come home!


157
0:16:15,988 --> 0:16:17,323
Boss Dog!


158
0:16:17,323 --> 0:16:21,661
Pookie!


159
0:16:21,661 --> 0:16:23,796
-What's up, player?
-What's new, partner?


160
0:16:23,796 --> 0:16:27,366
-All right. What you get, man?
-Shit.


161
0:16:27,366 --> 0:16:31,504
l got five years.
Or this here boot camp shit.


162
0:16:31,504 --> 0:16:32,571
Word?


163
0:16:32,571 --> 0:16:37,209
l heard some shit about that boot camp.
Redneck Ku Klux Klan motherfuckers.


164
0:16:37,209 --> 0:16:42,14
Tell you to eat your own shit,
you got to do it.


165
0:16:42,14 --> 0:16:43,949
Shit, dog...


166
0:16:43,949 --> 0:16:47,42
...l don't know if l wanna become
the type of nigger l gotta be...


167
0:16:47,42 --> 0:16:55,428
...to try to survive up in this bitch
for five years.


168
0:16:55,428 --> 0:16:58,964
-What up, King?
-Hey, baby, what's up?


169
0:16:58,964 --> 0:17:2,535
-What's up, dog?
-What's happening?


170
0:17:2,535 --> 0:17:3,969
l'm out.


171
0:17:3,969 --> 0:17:5,104
What?


172
0:17:5,104 --> 0:17:9,241
-How's you out and we in?
-Shit, nigger, l paid my lawyer.


173
0:17:9,241 --> 0:17:12,311
See, the key to this shit
is having a good lawyer.


174
0:17:12,311 --> 0:17:15,748
l give him a little something each month,
even if l'm not arrested.


175
0:17:15,748 --> 0:17:19,18
What happened to
all that motherfucking money y'all made?


176
0:17:19,18 --> 0:17:22,521
How many times l told y'all
you got to save your money?


177
0:17:22,521 --> 0:17:25,891
Now this shit here is the consequences
of the motherfucking game.


178
0:17:25,891 --> 0:17:28,894
Now you gotta deal with it.


179
0:17:28,894 --> 0:17:31,464
Let me tell y'all something, both of you.


180
0:17:31,464 --> 0:17:36,68
Keep your motherfucking mouth shut.


181
0:17:36,68 --> 0:17:38,537
All right, l'm outta here.


182
0:17:38,537 --> 0:17:42,7
-All right, King.
-All right, player.


183
0:17:42,7 --> 0:17:45,578
That there's a slick-ass nigger.


184
0:17:45,578 --> 0:17:50,649
l didn't qualify for no boot camp.
l got that prior, man.


185
0:17:50,649 --> 0:17:52,818
Them ugly-ass sneakers?


186
0:17:52,818 --> 0:17:59,759
l told you to leave them shits in the store,
you stupid-ass nigger, man.


187
0:17:59,759 --> 0:18:3,629
What you said about doing shit
you don't wanna do up in here to survive?


188
0:18:3,629 --> 0:18:8,534
l'm gonna have to do 'em, boss.
l got five years, no parole.


189
0:18:8,534 --> 0:18:12,872
Won't be no boot camp for me, man.


190
0:18:12,872 --> 0:18:15,107
Peter Jackson?


191
0:18:15,107 --> 0:18:17,943
-Yeah.
-Let's go!


192
0:18:17,943 --> 0:18:21,48
-All right, player, stay up.
-You do what you got to do now.


193
0:18:21,48 --> 0:18:29,488
Ta-dow.


194
0:18:29,488 --> 0:18:32,124
You're dead, motherfucker!


195
0:18:32,124 --> 0:18:35,561
-Fuck you, bitch-ass nigger.
-Hear me? You're dead!


196
0:18:35,561 --> 0:18:37,62
-Fuck you.
-You're dead!


197
0:18:37,62 --> 0:18:41,233
-Stuttering-ass bitch!
-Dead, motherfucker!


198
0:18:41,233 --> 0:18:43,235
Shit.


199
0:18:43,235 --> 0:18:52,945
What the fuck you looking at?


200
0:18:52,945 --> 0:18:55,514
My uncle, he owns a used-car lot
on Western.


201
0:18:55,514 --> 0:18:58,751
When l get outta here,
l'm gonna ask him for a job.


202
0:18:58,751 --> 0:19:1,187
Maybe he'll hook some of you up
with a job, too.


203
0:19:1,187 --> 0:19:5,724
All right, check it out, right there.
1959 Chevy BelAir.


204
0:19:5,724 --> 0:19:9,161
See the cat eyes?
How the fins are in the back there?


205
0:19:9,161 --> 0:19:11,33
Clean as hell, ain't it?


206
0:19:11,33 --> 0:19:13,399
l can tell you anything about cars.


207
0:19:13,399 --> 0:19:44,33
Right here we got
a 1984 Cadillac Eldorado....


208
0:19:44,33 --> 0:20:19,665
Oh shit, man, there it is.


209
0:20:19,665 --> 0:20:22,968
l don't see no walls, no fences, nothing.


210
0:20:22,968 --> 0:20:25,437
-How they gonna keep us in here?
-Let's rock.


211
0:20:25,437 --> 0:20:29,208
l'll book right now.


212
0:20:29,208 --> 0:20:30,776
That ain't shit, man.


213
0:20:30,776 --> 0:20:33,746
You oughta put your ass in the chair!


214
0:20:33,746 --> 0:20:48,227
Man, shut up!


215
0:20:48,227 --> 0:20:50,229
Break that up! Get off the bus!


216
0:20:50,229 --> 0:21:8,547
Go, go, go. Get off the bus, go, go!


217
0:21:8,547 --> 0:21:9,982
Shut up!


218
0:21:9,982 --> 0:21:15,821
Be quiet!


219
0:21:15,821 --> 0:21:17,923
Get your hands down!


220
0:21:17,923 --> 0:21:21,594
Get your nose up against that wall, freak!


221
0:21:21,594 --> 0:21:23,729
You!


222
0:21:23,729 --> 0:21:27,967
Turn around, face me!


223
0:21:27,967 --> 0:21:31,604
Arms out!


224
0:21:31,604 --> 0:21:34,39
Couple of gangbangers!


225
0:21:34,39 --> 0:21:35,441
You low-lives...


226
0:21:35,441 --> 0:21:39,211
...are now in
the lmpact lncarceration Program!


227
0:21:39,211 --> 0:21:41,981
Your first rule is
always acknowledge an order...


228
0:21:41,981 --> 0:21:45,484
...by saying, ''Yes, sir. No, sir.
Yes, ma'am. No, ma'am!''


229
0:21:45,484 --> 0:21:47,92
-You scum understand that?
-Yes, sir!


230
0:21:47,92 --> 0:21:52,157
-l can't hear you!
-Yes, sir!


231
0:21:52,157 --> 0:22:4,69
Everybody turn around and face me!


232
0:22:4,69 --> 0:22:8,474
Do l look like your friend?


233
0:22:8,474 --> 0:22:10,609
What is your first name, fat boy?


234
0:22:10,609 --> 0:22:14,913
Your first name is ''inmate!''
What is your first name?


235
0:22:14,913 --> 0:22:18,417
''lnmate,'' sir!


236
0:22:18,417 --> 0:22:21,687
-Do you think this is funny, moron?
-No, sir.


237
0:22:21,687 --> 0:22:24,523
-Wipe that smile off your face, inmate.
-l can't, ma'am.


238
0:22:24,523 --> 0:22:26,792
Get him out of here!


239
0:22:26,792 --> 0:22:27,96
Let's go, come on!


240
0:22:27,96 --> 0:22:30,429
See how funny the penitentiary is?


241
0:22:30,429 --> 0:22:32,498
Dummy!


242
0:22:32,498 --> 0:22:34,5
One down...


243
0:22:34,5 --> 0:22:38,671
...17 to go. Guards!


244
0:22:38,671 --> 0:23:12,738
Everybody else, move out!


245
0:23:12,738 --> 0:23:16,442
l'm Superintendent Sorley.


246
0:23:16,442 --> 0:23:22,14
From this point forward,
you will take no actions on your own.


247
0:23:22,14 --> 0:23:24,149
You will do absolutely nothing...


248
0:23:24,149 --> 0:23:27,52
...unless you are instructed to
by a member of this staff.


249
0:23:27,52 --> 0:23:29,588
-Do you understand that?
-Yes, sir!


250
0:23:29,588 --> 0:23:34,26
You have no reason to say anything
to the inmate standing next to you.


251
0:23:34,26 --> 0:23:36,562
You are all here alone.


252
0:23:36,562 --> 0:23:40,199
lf after 120 days, you all decide
you wanna call each other up...


253
0:23:40,199 --> 0:23:44,103
...and talk about all the good times you had
while you were here, that's fine.


254
0:23:44,103 --> 0:23:48,407
But while you are here, no talking. Ever.


255
0:23:48,407 --> 0:23:51,21
Any time, any place...


256
0:23:51,21 --> 0:23:54,313
...ever.


257
0:23:54,313 --> 0:23:57,149
This program is unfair.


258
0:23:57,149 --> 0:24:1,754
lt was designed to be unfair. Life is unfair.


259
0:24:1,754 --> 0:24:4,22
-Do you understand that?
-Yes, sir!


260
0:24:4,22 --> 0:24:6,425
Now, there will be no escapes.


261
0:24:6,425 --> 0:24:9,928
lf you try to escape,
we will apprehend you.


262
0:24:9,928 --> 0:24:13,732
We'll hunt you down like the animals
that you are and after you are caught...


263
0:24:13,732 --> 0:24:17,169
...you will get seven to 10 years added
to whatever time you're doing.


264
0:24:17,169 --> 0:24:22,4
-Do you understand that?
-Yes, sir!


265
0:24:22,4 --> 0:24:25,844
You're all non-violent first-time felons.


266
0:24:25,844 --> 0:24:28,914
Sentences between two and five years.


267
0:24:28,914 --> 0:24:34,92
Now, all of you, each and every--


268
0:24:34,92 --> 0:24:41,827
Stand up.


269
0:24:41,827 --> 0:24:46,865
You put your eyes on me again,
l will pop them right out of your head.


270
0:24:46,865 --> 0:24:51,36
Yes, sir!


271
0:24:51,36 --> 0:24:54,6
My staff will not lay a hand on you.


272
0:24:54,6 --> 0:24:56,875
And you will not lay a hand on my staff.


273
0:24:56,875 --> 0:24:59,611
Anyone who takes a swing
at one of my staff members...


274
0:24:59,611 --> 0:25:2,748
...will then cease to be an inmate
and will become a convict.


275
0:25:2,748 --> 0:25:4,817
And believe me...


276
0:25:4,817 --> 0:25:7,452
...we know how to deal with convicts here.


277
0:25:7,452 --> 0:25:12,991
This program exists solely to make room
in our over-crowded prison system...


278
0:25:12,991 --> 0:25:15,527
...and to save taxpayers' dollars.


279
0:25:15,527 --> 0:25:19,164
That is all we have to do.


280
0:25:19,164 --> 0:25:22,1
lt is not our job to straighten you out.


281
0:25:22,1 --> 0:25:24,269
lt is your job.


282
0:25:24,269 --> 0:25:30,242
lt is your responsibility.


283
0:25:30,242 --> 0:25:43,21
Move out!


284
0:25:43,21 --> 0:25:45,257
-What are you in for?
-Car theft, ma'am.


285
0:25:45,257 --> 0:25:47,25
-Are you a drunk driver?
-No, ma'am.


286
0:25:47,25 --> 0:25:49,595
You run over old ladies
while they get in your way?


287
0:25:49,595 --> 0:25:53,365
Why are you wasting my time?


288
0:25:53,365 --> 0:25:56,201
-Get out of my chair!
-You sold my sister heroin?


289
0:25:56,201 --> 0:25:58,971
-No, sir.
-Why, my sister ain't good enough?


290
0:25:58,971 --> 0:26:1,94
-No, sir.
-What? What?


291
0:26:1,94 --> 0:26:5,577
What is this? Pick it up!


292
0:26:5,577 --> 0:26:8,38
-What's your last name, you idiot?
-Buber, ma'am.


293
0:26:8,38 --> 0:26:10,315
-Ever attempt suicide?
-No, ma'am.


294
0:26:10,315 --> 0:26:12,317
You're sure, with a name like ''Boob''?


295
0:26:12,317 --> 0:26:15,52
You sure look like an idiot to me.


296
0:26:15,52 --> 0:26:21,26
-Yes, ma'am.
-You're a real piece of work, idiot. Shot...


297
0:26:21,26 --> 0:26:23,962
...stabbed. What's that?


298
0:26:23,962 --> 0:26:25,197
Bite mark, ma'am.


299
0:26:25,197 --> 0:26:28,4
-Who bit you, you idiot. Your girlfriend?
-Yes, ma'am.


300
0:26:28,4 --> 0:26:30,736
Being mean to her? Probably deserved it.


301
0:26:30,736 --> 0:26:33,739
A look at your body
and your secret's out, Sims.


302
0:26:33,739 --> 0:26:35,741
We both know you don't belong here!


303
0:26:35,741 --> 0:26:38,377
Ma'am, l have a bullet in my back.


304
0:26:38,377 --> 0:26:42,114
-Now? lt's in your back now?
-Yes, ma'am, right here.


305
0:26:42,114 --> 0:26:44,516
That's just great. What else, you idiot?


306
0:26:44,516 --> 0:26:48,487
l have no feeling in these fingers
from the handcuffs when l got arrested.


307
0:26:48,487 --> 0:26:51,223
You're not gonna get out of work detail
'cause of that!


308
0:26:51,223 --> 0:26:53,325
-l wasn't--
-Shut up! Nobody asked you.


309
0:26:53,325 --> 0:26:58,764
Keep looking straight ahead, dummy!


310
0:26:58,764 --> 0:27:0,432
Everybody!


311
0:27:0,432 --> 0:27:11,543
Prepare to mount!


312
0:27:11,543 --> 0:27:19,151
Mount!


313
0:27:19,151 --> 0:27:26,458
Sleep!


314
0:27:26,458 --> 0:27:33,98
Fuck Calhoun!


315
0:27:33,98 --> 0:27:41,606
Everybody on their feet!


316
0:27:41,606 --> 0:27:46,311
-Who wants to fuck Calhoun? You?
-No, no, sir.


317
0:27:46,311 --> 0:27:49,481
-You wanna fuck Calhoun?
-No, sir.


318
0:27:49,481 --> 0:27:51,683
How about you?


319
0:27:51,683 --> 0:27:56,154
-You wanna fuck Calhoun?
-No, sir!


320
0:27:56,154 --> 0:27:59,458
No talking ever!


321
0:27:59,458 --> 0:28:3,929
That means never!


322
0:28:3,929 --> 0:28:6,565
Maybe we should be able to say
whatever we want to...


323
0:28:6,565 --> 0:28:8,734
...in language they understand.


324
0:28:8,734 --> 0:28:11,67
lf they can't take it in here
without losing control...


325
0:28:11,67 --> 0:28:15,54
...how are they gonna make it in the street
where it'll be 10 times worse?


326
0:28:15,54 --> 0:28:18,577
Yes, but within limits.


327
0:28:18,577 --> 0:28:21,413
We have our boundaries
and one of them is no cursing.


328
0:28:21,413 --> 0:28:25,684
That's not what they understand, Captain.
l know what these kids understand!


329
0:28:25,684 --> 0:28:29,821
l grew up with kids like this.


330
0:28:29,821 --> 0:28:33,91
We must be so much worse
than the street to them.


331
0:28:33,91 --> 0:28:36,495
lf you get them early
and just hit them hard!


332
0:28:36,495 --> 0:28:39,231
You can't hit them so hard
that you demoralize them.


333
0:28:39,231 --> 0:28:43,68
You've gotta give them some respect
and some space to come up.


334
0:28:43,68 --> 0:28:45,804
These kids are not
from your neighborhood.


335
0:28:45,804 --> 0:28:48,74
They're not going back
to your neighborhood.


336
0:28:48,74 --> 0:28:51,943
How about you?
Help the ones you can help...


337
0:28:51,943 --> 0:28:56,248
...and l'll work with the ones you can't.


338
0:28:56,248 --> 0:28:58,817
You know what l think?


339
0:28:58,817 --> 0:29:3,422
You should project your voice
from down here.


340
0:29:3,422 --> 0:29:17,903
lt's easier on your throat.


341
0:29:17,903 --> 0:29:21,706
You wear white because you are ghosts.


342
0:29:21,706 --> 0:29:25,143
Ghosts do not exist.


343
0:29:25,143 --> 0:29:29,14
As you have been told,
your milk cartons face front!


344
0:29:29,14 --> 0:29:30,849
Do it!


345
0:29:30,849 --> 0:29:35,754
And your plate touches the tray! Do it!


346
0:29:35,754 --> 0:29:40,192
You'll have exactly 10 minutes
in which to finish your food.


347
0:29:40,192 --> 0:29:41,893
At--


348
0:29:41,893 --> 0:29:45,797
Did you hear what l said, numb-nuts?
Milk carton faces front!


349
0:29:45,797 --> 0:29:47,732
Get up, Yance!


350
0:29:47,732 --> 0:29:51,97
Get up! You'll eat standing. Let's see
how much you can have in five seconds.


351
0:29:51,97 --> 0:29:59,544
Go!


352
0:29:59,544 --> 0:30:3,582
Not good enough! Give me 50 right now!
Everybody else, eat!


353
0:30:3,582 --> 0:30:7,686
Down, sucker!


354
0:30:7,686 --> 0:30:8,487
Down!


355
0:30:8,487 --> 0:30:9,321
One.


356
0:30:9,321 --> 0:30:11,56
-Down!
-Two.


357
0:30:11,56 --> 0:30:14,92
-Down!
-Three.


358
0:30:14,92 --> 0:30:15,627
All right, rodents!


359
0:30:15,627 --> 0:30:18,83
You ate off them,
now it's your turn to clean them!


360
0:30:18,83 --> 0:30:22,901
When l return,
l expect every pot, every pan...


361
0:30:22,901 --> 0:30:26,204
...and every dish in this kitchen
to be spotless!


362
0:30:26,204 --> 0:30:29,241
-Do l make myself clear?
-Yes, sir!


363
0:30:29,241 --> 0:30:53,331
Get to work!


364
0:30:53,331 --> 0:31:13,618
You son of a--


365
0:31:13,618 --> 0:31:18,623
Hey, stop! Break it up!


366
0:31:18,623 --> 0:31:22,494
You think every time you have a problem
with others you can resort to violence?


367
0:31:22,494 --> 0:31:23,562
No, ma'am!


368
0:31:23,562 --> 0:31:26,97
You think you have to marry
everyone you work with?


369
0:31:26,97 --> 0:31:27,265
No, ma'am!


370
0:31:27,265 --> 0:31:31,77
The two of you lack motivation
for working together as a team!


371
0:31:31,77 --> 0:31:34,906
We will assist you in acquiring
the proper motivation.


372
0:31:34,906 --> 0:31:40,145
Let's see how well you work together
carrying this log for the next 24 hours!


373
0:31:40,145 --> 0:31:44,249
Up the log, lift! Come on, down!


374
0:31:44,249 --> 0:31:46,618
Up at the knees! Down!


375
0:31:46,618 --> 0:31:48,453
And up!


376
0:31:48,453 --> 0:31:52,624
Come on, move, move, move!
Don't you fall, don't you!


377
0:31:52,624 --> 0:31:55,894
Feet on the ground. Good, down.


378
0:31:55,894 --> 0:31:57,295
Down.


379
0:31:57,295 --> 0:31:59,631
Up and come on down.


380
0:31:59,631 --> 0:32:19,384
Row the boat! Row, row, row your boat!


381
0:32:19,384 --> 0:32:34,65
Hurry up and wash your ass!


382
0:32:34,65 --> 0:32:42,4
That log's on the floor tomorrow...


383
0:32:42,4 --> 0:32:51,783
...you carry it another 24 hours.


384
0:32:51,783 --> 0:33:3,928
Shit, mosquitoes!


385
0:33:3,928 --> 0:33:6,431
By your leave, sir!


386
0:33:6,431 --> 0:33:8,733
-By your leave, sir!
-What did you say to me?


387
0:33:8,733 --> 0:33:10,368
By your leave, sir!


388
0:33:10,368 --> 0:33:12,3
Answer me. What did you say?


389
0:33:12,3 --> 0:33:14,5
Sir, l said that l don't believe--


390
0:33:14,5 --> 0:33:17,609
-You think this is the Cub Scouts, moron?
-No, sir, l don't think--


391
0:33:17,609 --> 0:33:21,68
You think if you keep cryin', l'll send you
home to your mama and daddy?


392
0:33:21,68 --> 0:33:23,615
You quit me now...


393
0:33:23,615 --> 0:33:26,551
...and l'm gonna ship your butt
right back to prison, dummy!


394
0:33:26,551 --> 0:33:29,921
Right now, understand?
ls that what you want?


395
0:33:29,921 --> 0:33:34,225
-ls that what you want?
-Yes, that's exactly what l want, sir!


396
0:33:34,225 --> 0:33:36,394
l quit, sir, l quit!


397
0:33:36,394 --> 0:33:38,229
Get out of my face, quitter.


398
0:33:38,229 --> 0:33:40,31
Go on, move, loser!


399
0:33:40,31 --> 0:34:37,288
Pack your gear and get a move on!


400
0:34:37,288 --> 0:34:40,24
Man, this shit here fucked up!


401
0:34:40,24 --> 0:34:45,163
They got some dicks in here!


402
0:34:45,163 --> 0:34:48,633
l been thinking.


403
0:34:48,633 --> 0:34:50,902
We have the wrong approach.


404
0:34:50,902 --> 0:34:54,973
-What? What you talking?
-You're Disciple. l'm Vice Lords, right?


405
0:34:54,973 --> 0:34:56,541
Fool, l know l'm folk!


406
0:34:56,541 --> 0:34:58,777
This gangbanger shit don't hold up in here!


407
0:34:58,777 --> 0:35:1,312
Don't do nothing
but send us both back to county!


408
0:35:1,312 --> 0:35:3,848
And l ain't going back
to no motherfucking prison!


409
0:35:3,848 --> 0:35:6,684
When we get back on the streets
we do what we gotta do.


410
0:35:6,684 --> 0:35:12,924
Motherfucking straight!


411
0:35:12,924 --> 0:35:15,927
Seem to me we got to work together.


412
0:35:15,927 --> 0:35:22,233
Unless we ain't never gonna get no sleep.


413
0:35:22,233 --> 0:35:26,938
-What's your name, partner?
-Tyrone.


414
0:35:26,938 --> 0:35:31,42
Greg.


415
0:35:31,42 --> 0:35:34,746
l'll put it to you like this here, player.


416
0:35:34,746 --> 0:35:41,82
We peace this shit out,
we be outta here by July.


417
0:35:41,82 --> 0:35:44,255
Be back on the streets by summertime!


418
0:35:44,255 --> 0:35:47,859
Won't see none of these
bitch-ass motherfuckers no more.


419
0:35:47,859 --> 0:35:55,333
Can make some money, get some clothes,
take care of some business.


420
0:35:55,333 --> 0:35:58,369
Goddamn, it sound good to me.
You down with that?


421
0:35:58,369 --> 0:36:7,879
l'm down with that.


422
0:36:7,879 --> 0:36:9,981
Well...


423
0:36:9,981 --> 0:36:13,17
...you bring 'em,
l'll wash 'em, you dry 'em...


424
0:36:13,17 --> 0:36:26,598
...we both stack 'em, all right?


425
0:36:26,598 --> 0:36:38,61
For now.


426
0:36:38,61 --> 0:36:41,679
Drill me night and day, baby,
till I get my fill,


427
0:36:41,679 --> 0:36:45,49
-Drill me, baby,
-Drill me, baby,


428
0:36:45,49 --> 0:36:48,219
-Drill me all night longI
-Drill me all night longI


429
0:36:48,219 --> 0:36:49,754
-Hoo-rah!
-Hoo-rah!


430
0:36:49,754 --> 0:36:51,456
-One mile!
-One mile!


431
0:36:51,456 --> 0:36:52,924
-Two miles!
-Two miles!


432
0:36:52,924 --> 0:36:54,492
-Three miles!
-Three miles!


433
0:36:54,492 --> 0:36:59,163
-No sweat!
-No sweat!


434
0:36:59,163 --> 0:37:2,367
Hey, player.


435
0:37:2,367 --> 0:37:10,875
You don't stammer when you cadence.


436
0:37:10,875 --> 0:37:13,912
Okay, gentlemen.
Who can find out the ''X''?


437
0:37:13,912 --> 0:37:15,547
You.


438
0:37:15,547 --> 0:37:16,748
You.


439
0:37:16,748 --> 0:37:19,717
You think you got the answer, go up there.
Go ahead.


440
0:37:19,717 --> 0:37:22,12
No, that's too easy, player.


441
0:37:22,12 --> 0:37:25,56
He's trying to insult our intelligence.


442
0:37:25,56 --> 0:37:27,425
Are there any volunteers?


443
0:37:27,425 --> 0:37:30,94
-We got one right here.
-Oh, Tyrone!


444
0:37:30,94 --> 0:37:31,996
Come on, Sims.


445
0:37:31,996 --> 0:37:35,867
Go ahead, Einstein, show him.


446
0:37:35,867 --> 0:37:45,41
Let's see you do it.


447
0:37:45,41 --> 0:37:47,879
7X minus 3X...


448
0:37:47,879 --> 0:37:51,549
...equal 28.


449
0:37:51,549 --> 0:37:54,52
X equals seven.


450
0:37:54,52 --> 0:38:0,291
All right.


451
0:38:0,291 --> 0:38:4,762
Experts report that the Midwest can expect
some of the worst flooding in years,


452
0:38:4,762 --> 0:38:7,966
Heavy rains continue to swell
the Mississippi River,,,


453
0:38:7,966 --> 0:38:10,735
,,,to the highest levels seen in years,


454
0:38:10,735 --> 0:38:14,572
Closer to home, no rain is expected
in this small Iowa River town,,,


455
0:38:14,572 --> 0:38:18,443
,,,but residents decided to spend
the weekend sandbagging the local levee,,,


456
0:38:18,443 --> 0:38:20,778
,,,in hopes of avoiding the heavy flooding,,,


457
0:38:20,778 --> 0:38:25,717
,,,which their neighbors to the north
have been battling for the last week,


458
0:38:25,717 --> 0:38:30,88
This is the worst flooding
the Midwest has seen in over 50 years.


459
0:38:30,88 --> 0:38:32,824
And right now
the National Guard is spread so thin...


460
0:38:32,824 --> 0:38:35,126
...that the governor has asked for our help.


461
0:38:35,126 --> 0:38:37,228
This is a perfect opportunity for us...


462
0:38:37,228 --> 0:38:41,399
...to show what this program
and our men are all about.


463
0:38:41,399 --> 0:38:45,57
River broke through
right here at Davenport.


464
0:38:45,57 --> 0:38:48,339
Flooded 25,000 acres of farmland.


465
0:38:48,339 --> 0:38:52,143
Right now,
Davenport is 15 feet underwater.


466
0:38:52,143 --> 0:38:57,281
Fifteen-thousand people have lost
their homes and been evacuated.


467
0:38:57,281 --> 0:39:0,351
-You got any questions?
-No, sir.


468
0:39:0,351 --> 0:39:6,9
Sir, l don't think our unit is really ready
to deal with a situation like this.


469
0:39:6,9 --> 0:39:7,659
Those are the orders.


470
0:39:7,659 --> 0:39:9,794
Our men are gonna help with this flood.


471
0:39:9,794 --> 0:39:12,463
And l'll tell you,
they're gonna do a damn good job.


472
0:39:12,463 --> 0:39:16,768
All right, let's get it.


473
0:39:16,768 --> 0:39:19,37
This is the perfect challenge
for these inmates.


474
0:39:19,37 --> 0:39:22,674
Just the kind of positive publicity
this program needs.


475
0:39:22,674 --> 0:39:28,12
-lt's gonna be great for these kids.
-lt'll be great for some of these kids.


476
0:39:28,12 --> 0:39:32,16
Some of these other kids will finish
this program and be back on the street...


477
0:39:32,16 --> 0:39:36,421
...doing the same thing that got them here
in the first place. Or worse.


478
0:39:36,421 --> 0:39:37,722
And tell me, Captain.


479
0:39:37,722 --> 0:39:41,759
What is it gonna do for this program
if one of these kids assaults a farmer?


480
0:39:41,759 --> 0:39:44,662
Or worse yet,
touches some white girl in that town?


481
0:39:44,662 --> 0:39:48,66
That is not gonna happen.
These are non-violent felons.


482
0:39:48,66 --> 0:39:52,3
Ten years ago, these first-time kids
would've just been given probation.


483
0:39:52,3 --> 0:39:54,672
The same way
first-time rich white kids still are.


484
0:39:54,672 --> 0:39:59,43
Those white kids you're talking about,
they got nice homes and nice parents.


485
0:39:59,43 --> 0:40:2,714
You can be sure they won't allow their kid
to get caught a second time.


486
0:40:2,714 --> 0:40:5,149
These men don't come
from those neighborhoods!


487
0:40:5,149 --> 0:40:12,99
And the last thing they need is somebody
telling them that their race is an excuse!


488
0:40:12,99 --> 0:40:15,927
This program believes
that young men can change.


489
0:40:15,927 --> 0:40:19,43
-Are you with the program, Officer?
-Yes, l am, ma'am.


490
0:40:19,43 --> 0:40:24,535
All right.


491
0:40:24,535 --> 0:40:27,638
Got a mighty long time on this here land,


492
0:40:27,638 --> 0:40:30,641
Got a mighty long time on this here land,


493
0:40:30,641 --> 0:40:33,711
I can't have me a woman,
so I use my hand,


494
0:40:33,711 --> 0:40:37,849
I can't have me a woman,
so I use my hand,


495
0:40:37,849 --> 0:40:40,752
All right, people, hands on your hips!


496
0:40:40,752 --> 0:40:42,687
-One!
-Down!


497
0:40:42,687 --> 0:40:43,755
Up!


498
0:40:43,755 --> 0:40:45,79
-Two!
-Down!


499
0:40:45,79 --> 0:40:46,858
Up!


500
0:40:46,858 --> 0:40:49,56
Three!


501
0:40:49,56 --> 0:40:51,729
Yance!


502
0:40:51,729 --> 0:40:54,298
Get over here!


503
0:40:54,298 --> 0:40:57,535
What's the matter
with the rest of you people?


504
0:40:57,535 --> 0:41:3,908
Get those hands down!


505
0:41:3,908 --> 0:41:7,145
You think this is a joke?
You still wanna be gangbang around here?


506
0:41:7,145 --> 0:41:8,212
No, sir.


507
0:41:8,212 --> 0:41:10,414
l saw what you just did.


508
0:41:10,414 --> 0:41:13,718
-That wasn't no gangbang--
-Who told you to talk without permission?


509
0:41:13,718 --> 0:41:16,254
You think the rules are for everybody
but you?


510
0:41:16,254 --> 0:41:22,56
That's what got your little butt here
in the first--


511
0:41:22,56 --> 0:41:25,429
Tom, l'll take him to the storage room
for a few minutes.


512
0:41:25,429 --> 0:41:29,233
You make sure l'm not disturbed?


513
0:41:29,233 --> 0:41:35,873
You follow me, Miss Yance.


514
0:41:35,873 --> 0:41:55,493
Straight ahead.


515
0:41:55,493 --> 0:42:4,302
Take your hat off.


516
0:42:4,302 --> 0:42:11,309
You know you're the enemy, Yance?


517
0:42:11,309 --> 0:42:14,846
You don't know that, do you?


518
0:42:14,846 --> 0:42:19,16
l'll bet your black ass doesn't even know
there's a war going on.


519
0:42:19,16 --> 0:42:22,453
And l'm not talking about the war
on crime and drugs.


520
0:42:22,453 --> 0:42:25,323
l'm talking about the war
between Black people...


521
0:42:25,323 --> 0:42:28,92
...and niggers.


522
0:42:28,92 --> 0:42:32,363
That's what you are, Yance.


523
0:42:32,363 --> 0:42:34,932
You a motherfucking nigger.


524
0:42:34,932 --> 0:42:37,802
Let me tell you something.


525
0:42:37,802 --> 0:42:41,572
God, l hate niggers.


526
0:42:41,572 --> 0:42:43,574
l love Black people.


527
0:42:43,574 --> 0:42:49,28
Honest, hardworking,
law-abiding Black people.


528
0:42:49,28 --> 0:42:54,51
Niggers like you make me sick.


529
0:42:54,51 --> 0:42:58,422
There's no problem for a nigger
to get his own people hooked on drugs.


530
0:42:58,422 --> 0:43:1,592
Got the girls on the corner
turning $5 tricks.


531
0:43:1,592 --> 0:43:4,28
No problem for a nigger
to shoot another nigger.


532
0:43:4,28 --> 0:43:6,464
No problem for a nigger to rob and steal...


533
0:43:6,464 --> 0:43:9,3
...from good, honest,
hardworking Black people.


534
0:43:9,3 --> 0:43:13,137
That's what they want.
You're doing their work for them.


535
0:43:13,137 --> 0:43:16,54
You know what's so fucked up about that?


536
0:43:16,54 --> 0:43:20,311
You look at me
and you call me an ''Uncle Tom?''


537
0:43:20,311 --> 0:43:23,147
You are the Uncle Tom!


538
0:43:23,147 --> 0:43:29,854
You fucking joke!
You are the real enemy of Black people.


539
0:43:29,854 --> 0:43:33,291
White people look at me,
it kills me that they see you...


540
0:43:33,291 --> 0:43:37,128
...'cause there ain't but one nigger
in this here closet.


541
0:43:37,128 --> 0:43:41,699
You been here this long
and you gonna try to run a game on me?


542
0:43:41,699 --> 0:43:44,969
This here is where the game ends.


543
0:43:44,969 --> 0:43:47,972
l don't believe
you're ever gonna have a home.


544
0:43:47,972 --> 0:43:50,174
Or have a half-decent job.


545
0:43:50,174 --> 0:43:52,343
Or get an education.


546
0:43:52,343 --> 0:43:55,79
Or even have a family worth a shit.


547
0:43:55,79 --> 0:43:56,747
You know why?


548
0:43:56,747 --> 0:43:58,616
Do you know why?


549
0:43:58,616 --> 0:44:3,387
Because you're happy
just to be a motherfucking nigger.


550
0:44:3,387 --> 0:44:7,358
The clock is ticking, son.


551
0:44:7,358 --> 0:44:14,31
You have no time.


552
0:44:14,31 --> 0:44:23,407
l don't believe you'll make it through
that motherfucking flood.


553
0:44:23,407 --> 0:44:35,586
Get out.


554
0:44:35,586 --> 0:44:38,789
When l get outta here...


555
0:44:38,789 --> 0:44:42,159
...l'm gonna come back down here
and smoke Calhoun.


556
0:44:42,159 --> 0:44:43,794
Yeah?


557
0:44:43,794 --> 0:44:46,63
Well, l'll posse with you.


558
0:44:46,63 --> 0:44:49,166
Motherfucker talking all kinds of crazy shit.


559
0:44:49,166 --> 0:44:52,87
He the type of motherfucker
hate his own damn race.


560
0:44:52,87 --> 0:44:55,239
Call me a nigger.


561
0:44:55,239 --> 0:45:4,949
That's the type of nigger right there.
Gotta say ain't nothing but an Uncle Tom.


562
0:45:4,949 --> 0:45:7,251
Yeah.


563
0:45:7,251 --> 0:45:9,62
Yes, sir.


564
0:45:9,62 --> 0:45:13,524
Yes, he is.


565
0:45:13,524 --> 0:45:16,827
A staggering amount of the Midwest
is underwater tonight,,,


566
0:45:16,827 --> 0:45:19,997
,,,as the deadly Mississippi
continues to rush southward,,,


567
0:45:19,997 --> 0:45:22,633
,,,destroying everything in its path,


568
0:45:22,633 --> 0:45:23,968
It's official, folks,


569
0:45:23,968 --> 0:45:28,72
This is the worst flood
to hit the Midwest in 100 years,


570
0:45:28,72 --> 0:45:49,393
As one exhausted volunteer put it,
all you can do is hope for the best,


571
0:45:49,393 --> 0:45:52,163
All right, off the bus and fall in!


572
0:45:52,163 --> 0:46:21,125
Let's go! Move, move, move!


573
0:46:21,125 --> 0:46:23,94
Rednecks.


574
0:46:23,94 --> 0:46:26,464
Confederate flag
under them damn sandbags.


575
0:46:26,464 --> 0:46:37,908
Sims, give me 50!


576
0:46:37,908 --> 0:46:41,278
-Mary McBride, Dept. of Corrections.
-Civil Defense, welcome aboard.


577
0:46:41,278 --> 0:46:42,346
Thank you.


578
0:46:42,346 --> 0:46:44,949
Might not look too bad
on a nice day like this.


579
0:46:44,949 --> 0:46:47,651
A hundred miles north of here,
it's raining like hell.


580
0:46:47,651 --> 0:46:50,754
We're gonna get the full brunt of that
when it rolls down here.


581
0:46:50,754 --> 0:46:52,756
The crest is already rising fast.


582
0:46:52,756 --> 0:46:55,86
We'll have to raise this whole bank
4 feet by tomorrow...


583
0:46:55,86 --> 0:47:1,565
...or we'll lose 1,500 acres of crops,
and the whole town of Niota.


584
0:47:1,565 --> 0:47:2,633
Okay.


585
0:47:2,633 --> 0:47:7,705
All right, l wanna see those sandbags
move. Let's go, team. Go, go!


586
0:47:7,705 --> 0:47:10,174
Let's make those sandbags
fly through the air.


587
0:47:10,174 --> 0:47:11,609
Let's go!


588
0:47:11,609 --> 0:47:14,678
What the hell is this?


589
0:47:14,678 --> 0:47:19,483
l ain't working with these people!


590
0:47:19,483 --> 0:47:21,252
You talking about my men?


591
0:47:21,252 --> 0:47:23,854
How we supposed to work
with one hand on our wallet?


592
0:47:23,854 --> 0:47:25,923
Military don't work with convicts.


593
0:47:25,923 --> 0:47:28,893
l didn't realize a yearly camp-out
made you fellas military.


594
0:47:28,893 --> 0:47:31,629
You're just a prison guard.
You got no say over us.


595
0:47:31,629 --> 0:47:34,64
You just keep the criminals away from us.


596
0:47:34,64 --> 0:47:36,934
-Where you from, Guardsman?
-Kentucky.


597
0:47:36,934 --> 0:47:48,12
How's about l just kick your ass
all the way back to Paducah?


598
0:47:48,12 --> 0:47:49,647
Let's move those bags!


599
0:47:49,647 --> 0:47:51,282
Let's show these people, man.


600
0:47:51,282 --> 0:47:52,983
Move those bags!


601
0:47:52,983 --> 0:47:55,119
Come on, let's go, come on.


602
0:47:55,119 --> 0:47:57,855
Come on!


603
0:47:57,855 --> 0:48:0,224
Work those bags, come on!


604
0:48:0,224 --> 0:48:1,992
Move those bags!


605
0:48:1,992 --> 0:48:10,367
-Hoo-rah!
-Hoo-rah!


606
0:48:10,367 --> 0:48:14,838
-Some people say we're just no good,
-Some people say we're just no good,


607
0:48:14,838 --> 0:48:18,776
-Sometimes we don't do what we should,
-Sometimes we don't do what we should,


608
0:48:18,776 --> 0:48:30,187
But then some good come from our hood,


609
0:48:30,187 --> 0:48:35,693
-We work for the pride, don't need no pay,
-We work for the pride, don't need no pay,


610
0:48:35,693 --> 0:48:38,262
-One sandbag!
-One sandbag!


611
0:48:38,262 --> 0:48:54,311
-Two sandbags!
-Two sandbags!


612
0:48:54,311 --> 0:48:58,148
That fish of yours stinks.


613
0:48:58,148 --> 0:49:4,188
This here is catfish. This is soul food.


614
0:49:4,188 --> 0:49:8,392
Excuse me.


615
0:49:8,392 --> 0:49:14,865
You men have done a fantastic job today.


616
0:49:14,865 --> 0:49:17,167
-Y'all eat up.
-Thank you, ma'am.


617
0:49:17,167 --> 0:49:23,941
-There's plenty more.
-Okay, ma'am.


618
0:49:23,941 --> 0:49:39,39
lf you don't want it,
l might as well help myself.


619
0:49:39,39 --> 0:49:43,427
You're insulting these people who made
this meal with your lack of manners.


620
0:49:43,427 --> 0:49:46,597
Your meal is done, boy.
You get outside, you wait outside.


621
0:49:46,597 --> 0:49:51,68
And you're next.


622
0:49:51,68 --> 0:49:57,107
We will not break discipline, gentlemen.
We will not. Understood?


623
0:49:57,107 --> 0:50:1,645
And we will not eyeball me, Yance.


624
0:50:1,645 --> 0:50:4,248
Get out, you, too. Go, get out!


625
0:50:4,248 --> 0:50:16,827
That means now, Yance. Go, now!


626
0:50:16,827 --> 0:50:19,663
Do we have a problem?
Okay, we all have a problem.


627
0:50:19,663 --> 0:50:24,868
Everybody, get the hell out.


628
0:50:24,868 --> 0:50:38,749
l'll teach you goddamn fools!


629
0:50:38,749 --> 0:50:55,933
All right, men, you have been disciplined.
Now go back and finish your meal!


630
0:50:55,933 --> 0:50:58,168
They need to eat to keep their strength up.


631
0:50:58,168 --> 0:51:0,604
You embarrassed them
in front of the whole town!


632
0:51:0,604 --> 0:51:4,575
l know you have your agenda
and l respect that, but you go too far!


633
0:51:4,575 --> 0:51:11,148
One more time
and l will see to it that you are suspended.


634
0:51:11,148 --> 0:51:15,452
-Don't worry about your town,
-Don't worry about your town,


635
0:51:15,452 --> 0:51:19,556
-We ain't gonna let you down,
-We ain't gonna let you down,


636
0:51:19,556 --> 0:51:37,141
-Pick you up and turn you around,
-Pick you up and turn you around,


637
0:51:37,141 --> 0:51:41,412
-You must be thirsty after all that work.
-Thank you, ma'am.


638
0:51:41,412 --> 0:51:44,114
l'd work all day
with this fresh air out in the wilds.


639
0:51:44,114 --> 0:51:47,851
-ln ''the wilds?''
-Wilderness.


640
0:51:47,851 --> 0:51:51,422
Whatever you wanna call it. lt's beautiful.


641
0:51:51,422 --> 0:51:57,261
Where l come from you can't even breathe.
The buildings cramp you in so.


642
0:51:57,261 --> 0:52:1,131
Nothing like this.
All these beautiful trees, fresh air.


643
0:52:1,131 --> 0:52:2,833
Hey, everybody!


644
0:52:2,833 --> 0:52:5,769
Grandview is underwater!


645
0:52:5,769 --> 0:52:7,771
lt's headed your way!


646
0:52:7,771 --> 0:52:15,679
Sharon's got a sister in Grandview.


647
0:52:15,679 --> 0:52:18,382
lf you don't mind me asking, sir...


648
0:52:18,382 --> 0:52:20,918
...what would happen if this town floods?


649
0:52:20,918 --> 0:52:25,456
Well, the bolt factory outside town
will definitely flood.


650
0:52:25,456 --> 0:52:27,24
Sharon works there.


651
0:52:27,24 --> 0:52:29,126
Most people here do.


652
0:52:29,126 --> 0:52:31,61
They'll all lose their jobs.


653
0:52:31,61 --> 0:52:33,564
People's homes...


654
0:52:33,564 --> 0:52:35,566
...they'd be ruined.


655
0:52:35,566 --> 0:52:38,68
No home, no job.


656
0:52:38,68 --> 0:52:40,27
Families will have to move.


657
0:52:40,27 --> 0:52:51,815
The town just won't be the same.


658
0:52:51,815 --> 0:52:58,322
-l'm gonna call you ''nature boy''.
-Those frogs eat them damn mosquitoes.


659
0:52:58,322 --> 0:53:3,927
This air out here is straight.


660
0:53:3,927 --> 0:53:9,666
-Got some decent people, too.
-For crackers.


661
0:53:9,666 --> 0:53:15,172
They're people just like you and me.


662
0:53:15,172 --> 0:53:18,675
So, what you saying?


663
0:53:18,675 --> 0:53:24,248
-We need to save this damn town.
-Yeah, do some good work.


664
0:53:24,248 --> 0:53:28,519
Come back down here,
work on a damn farm.


665
0:53:28,519 --> 0:53:31,655
That right? l'll ride the tractor.


666
0:53:31,655 --> 0:53:34,892
Put a spoiler on it.


667
0:53:34,892 --> 0:53:38,562
-Yo, Greg.
-What's happening, player?


668
0:53:38,562 --> 0:53:42,499
What will we do
when we get back on the streets?


669
0:53:42,499 --> 0:53:47,471
Shit, man. l'm just trying to do
what l got to do, you know?


670
0:53:47,471 --> 0:53:51,742
You know l'm Disciple, and you...


671
0:53:51,742 --> 0:53:53,51
...you still Vice Lord.


672
0:53:53,51 --> 0:53:56,48
Shit. Listen here, dude.


673
0:53:56,48 --> 0:54:0,25
-l'm just trying to live my life.
-One life to live, huh?


674
0:54:0,25 --> 0:54:1,818
Ta-dow.


675
0:54:1,818 --> 0:54:54,237
Ta-dow.


676
0:54:54,237 --> 0:55:15,659
Hey, dude, you ain't moving nothing.
This is how.


677
0:55:15,659 --> 0:55:17,16
Sims!


678
0:55:17,16 --> 0:55:44,488
Get over here!


679
0:55:44,488 --> 0:55:48,258
After 3 inches of rain last night,
flood waters destroyed main levees,,,


680
0:55:48,258 --> 0:55:50,527
,,,40 miles north of Niota,


681
0:55:50,527 --> 0:55:52,162
Niota's in a bad place.


682
0:55:52,162 --> 0:55:58,602
When the flood passes this curve,
it's gonna hit us hard.


683
0:55:58,602 --> 0:56:1,138
-You have children?
-Yes, sir, two boys.


684
0:56:1,138 --> 0:56:4,141
-You a free man in what, two weeks?
-Eight days, sir.


685
0:56:4,141 --> 0:56:7,344
How'd you get involved
in the drug business?


686
0:56:7,344 --> 0:56:11,948
-Did your mother sell drugs?
-My mother didn't sell no drugs, sir.


687
0:56:11,948 --> 0:56:14,184
Okay, what about your father?


688
0:56:14,184 --> 0:56:15,886
l don't know!


689
0:56:15,886 --> 0:56:17,988
Where is your father? He still alive?


690
0:56:17,988 --> 0:56:20,323
l don't know, sir.


691
0:56:20,323 --> 0:56:24,161
-l'm just asking. What's your excuse, son?
-Ain't no excuse here.


692
0:56:24,161 --> 0:56:26,563
Don't bullshit me.
There's always some excuse.


693
0:56:26,563 --> 0:56:28,999
''My family was poor,
l didn't have no father.


694
0:56:28,999 --> 0:56:30,834
''My mother was turning tricks.''


695
0:56:30,834 --> 0:56:33,67
lt doesn't stop with you,
your mother and father.


696
0:56:33,67 --> 0:56:36,573
You got children of your own
and they're watching you.


697
0:56:36,573 --> 0:56:38,41
And if your kids say:


698
0:56:38,41 --> 0:56:41,545
''My daddy is a gangbanger,
my daddy is a drug dealer.''


699
0:56:41,545 --> 0:56:44,314
You're giving your kids the perfect excuse.


700
0:56:44,314 --> 0:56:46,83
Don't talk about my kids!


701
0:56:46,83 --> 0:56:49,386
You're gonna go get a gun and shoot me
'cause l dissed you, huh?


702
0:56:49,386 --> 0:56:53,857
-Just don't talk about my kids.
-Put your goddamn hand down, boy.


703
0:56:53,857 --> 0:56:57,294
-What about the mother of your children?
-Don't even talk about her!


704
0:56:57,294 --> 0:56:58,762
l'll teach my kids!


705
0:56:58,762 --> 0:57:2,32
Teach your kids what, boy?
How to be a gangbanger?


706
0:57:2,32 --> 0:57:7,237
How to sell a $5 vial of crack cocaine?


707
0:57:7,237 --> 0:57:10,54
You leave that man alone!
Leave that man alone!


708
0:57:10,54 --> 0:57:14,978
-My kids ain't like that!
-Your kids shooting our people.


709
0:57:14,978 --> 0:57:17,981
-Robbing our people.
-You all talk!


710
0:57:17,981 --> 0:57:20,45
-Don't walk away from me!
-lnmate, be quiet now!


711
0:57:20,45 --> 0:57:22,519
Sergeant, l want you--


712
0:57:22,519 --> 0:57:23,62
What!


713
0:57:23,62 --> 0:57:26,423
You ain't gonna do nothin'!


714
0:57:26,423 --> 0:57:29,993
When your kids come to boot camp,
l won't let them back on the street!


715
0:57:29,993 --> 0:57:34,798
l swear, l'll kill your motherfucking ass!


716
0:57:34,798 --> 0:57:37,367
You ain't doing nothing to my kids,
dammit!


717
0:57:37,367 --> 0:57:39,169
l hit hard, don't l?


718
0:57:39,169 --> 0:57:44,941
Seven more years in the penitentiary.


719
0:57:44,941 --> 0:57:52,382
l don't let nobody
talk about my family, ever!


720
0:57:52,382 --> 0:58:21,845
Shut up, inmate.


721
0:58:21,845 --> 0:58:27,184
That's it. You're suspended.


722
0:58:27,184 --> 0:58:32,255
Don't push me, man.


723
0:58:32,255 --> 0:58:34,457
Do something. This ain't right, Captain!


724
0:58:34,457 --> 0:58:37,761
That inmate attacked an officer.
He's going back to county!


725
0:58:37,761 --> 0:58:40,897
Come on, everybody back to work!


726
0:58:40,897 --> 0:58:43,733
All right, let's go!
Everybody, let's move it!


727
0:58:43,733 --> 0:58:47,671
Ma'am, Sims was okay.
He was gonna make it.


728
0:58:47,671 --> 0:58:50,407
Boot camp's about tearing down
and building up.


729
0:58:50,407 --> 0:58:55,378
Calhoun don't build up nothing!
He don't do nothing but tear down!


730
0:58:55,378 --> 0:58:58,181
Look at what we do,
helping people save their town!


731
0:58:58,181 --> 0:59:1,818
Y'all wanna play boot camp?
This shit here bigger than boot camp!


732
0:59:1,818 --> 0:59:5,88
-This shit is for real!
-What will you do about it?


733
0:59:5,88 --> 0:59:9,392
You gonna pout?
Lay down and go back to prison?


734
0:59:9,392 --> 0:59:16,99
l got no time for this shit.


735
0:59:16,99 --> 0:59:31,381
You better think about this.


736
0:59:31,381 --> 0:59:34,451
Fuck this!


737
0:59:34,451 --> 0:59:38,855
Listen up, everybody, listen up,
The main levee's not going to hold,


738
0:59:38,855 --> 0:59:43,293
-Everybody in the truck nowI
-Guards, let's get the inmates on the bus!


739
0:59:43,293 --> 1:0:30,974
On the double!


740
1:0:30,974 --> 1:0:37,8
You're starting to piss me off.


741
1:0:37,8 --> 1:2:0,196
You wanna go back to prison?


742
1:2:0,196 --> 1:2:2,932
Come on.


743
1:2:2,932 --> 1:2:5,101
Let's move it. Move it.


744
1:2:5,101 --> 1:2:19,682
Give me a hand!


745
1:2:19,682 --> 1:2:31,194
Faster!


746
1:2:31,194 --> 1:2:41,171
Over here!


747
1:2:41,171 --> 1:2:43,406
Hold it.


748
1:2:43,406 --> 1:2:49,446
We got it, we got it.


749
1:2:49,446 --> 1:3:0,457
Come on, man.


750
1:3:0,457 --> 1:3:8,798
Everybody off, back to the truck!
lt's not gonna hold!


751
1:3:8,798 --> 1:3:15,872
Let's go!


752
1:3:15,872 --> 1:3:19,242
Let's go, guys.


753
1:3:19,242 --> 1:3:27,5
lt's slipping! Hold on!


754
1:3:27,5 --> 1:3:29,419
lt's not gonna hold!


755
1:3:29,419 --> 1:3:38,194
Oh, shit.


756
1:3:38,194 --> 1:3:45,68
Get down!


757
1:3:45,68 --> 1:3:46,87
We can stop it!


758
1:3:46,87 --> 1:3:50,373
lt's not gonna hold! Yance, come on!


759
1:3:50,373 --> 1:3:57,714
l ain't coming down.


760
1:3:57,714 --> 1:4:0,49
Yance, quit!


761
1:4:0,49 --> 1:5:16,726
No!


762
1:5:16,726 --> 1:5:42,85
You sure about this?


763
1:5:42,85 --> 1:5:48,157
We're on the high ground so we can relax.
What's the matter with them?


764
1:5:48,157 --> 1:5:50,76
They feel that they shouldn't eat your food.


765
1:5:50,76 --> 1:6:4,374
Because they couldn't stop
your town from flooding.


766
1:6:4,374 --> 1:6:7,71
You guys did the best job
that you could do.


767
1:6:7,71 --> 1:6:12,382
There's no reason for you
to feel like you failed.


768
1:6:12,382 --> 1:6:20,89
lf you weren't here
we would've lost everything.


769
1:6:20,89 --> 1:6:27,397
We know we lost our homes, but....


770
1:6:27,397 --> 1:6:32,302
You got out the furniture,
and the clothes and all the appliances...


771
1:6:32,302 --> 1:6:35,605
...and we were able to do this
while you helped us.


772
1:6:35,605 --> 1:6:41,344
Some people even got out
all of their livestock.


773
1:6:41,344 --> 1:6:44,58
What you guys did for us, that was just...


774
1:6:44,58 --> 1:6:47,83
...just amazing.


775
1:6:47,83 --> 1:6:50,887
lt was just amazing.


776
1:6:50,887 --> 1:6:55,58
So...


777
1:6:55,58 --> 1:7:0,129
...would you please come and eat with us?


778
1:7:0,129 --> 1:7:6,169
Come on. Please, you deserve it.


779
1:7:6,169 --> 1:7:13,242
You know what else? You guys are heroes.


780
1:7:13,242 --> 1:7:19,82
You are.


781
1:7:19,82 --> 1:7:35,631
Come on and eat with us. Come on.


782
1:7:35,631 --> 1:7:38,167
Yeah.


783
1:7:38,167 --> 1:7:53,683
Yeah, thank you so much!


784
1:7:53,683 --> 1:8:3,126
lnmate Buber.


785
1:8:3,126 --> 1:8:9,432
lnmate Yance.


786
1:8:9,432 --> 1:8:11,801
lnmate Yance...


787
1:8:11,801 --> 1:8:21,344
...for a job well done. Congratulations.


788
1:8:21,344 --> 1:8:24,881
The levees may break...


789
1:8:24,881 --> 1:8:30,887
...and you may work hard in this life
for some things that won't come through.


790
1:8:30,887 --> 1:8:36,359
But today, believe me,
you have all come through.


791
1:8:36,359 --> 1:8:41,597
All 14 of you men
have been through 120 days...


792
1:8:41,597 --> 1:8:46,569
...of hard work, discipline,
and commitment.


793
1:8:46,569 --> 1:8:49,405
And you all deserve to graduate.


794
1:8:49,405 --> 1:8:51,808
l just want you to know...


795
1:8:51,808 --> 1:8:56,579
...that l am proud
of each and every one of you...


796
1:8:56,579 --> 1:8:59,949
...and you should all
be proud of yourselves.


797
1:8:59,949 --> 1:9:3,853
Life is tough. lt's hard.


798
1:9:3,853 --> 1:9:7,23
Nobody knows that more than you do.


799
1:9:7,23 --> 1:9:12,228
And when you leave here,
you may run into some setbacks.


800
1:9:12,228 --> 1:9:18,534
But no matter what these setbacks are,
no matter how difficult it is...


801
1:9:18,534 --> 1:9:22,438
...l want you to never give up. Never!


802
1:9:22,438 --> 1:9:24,574
Just like Niota.


803
1:9:24,574 --> 1:9:26,8
Hoo-rah!


804
1:9:26,8 --> 1:9:27,31
Hoo-rah!


805
1:9:27,31 --> 1:9:29,479
Hoo-rah!


806
1:9:29,479 --> 1:10:8,417
Hoo-rah!


807
1:10:8,417 --> 1:10:14,824
Let's go, let's go!


808
1:10:14,824 --> 1:10:18,928
l wanted to congratulate you.


809
1:10:18,928 --> 1:10:22,532
And...


810
1:10:22,532 --> 1:10:26,636
...good luck.


811
1:10:26,636 --> 1:10:29,405
Thank you, sir.


812
1:10:29,405 --> 1:10:31,774
l've seen a lot of guys
graduate this program.


813
1:10:31,774 --> 1:10:34,176
A month later they're back in the pen.


814
1:10:34,176 --> 1:10:37,58
But what about you, son?


815
1:10:37,58 --> 1:11:59,729
You gonna be one of those guys?
Or are you gonna surprise me?


816
1:11:59,729 --> 1:12:3,232

817
1:12:3,232 --> 1:12:5,401

Gimme some love. Good to see you, man.


820
1:12:12,975 --> 1:12:17,46
Oh, shit.
You's a muscled-up nigger now, huh?


821
1:12:17,46 --> 1:12:19,815
Man, they work your ass

822
1:12:19,815 --> 1:12:23,586

823
1:12:23,586 --> 1:12:25,988

1:12:36,399 --> 1:12:37,5
Damn.


828
1:12:37,5 --> 1:12:40,536
-Can't go 100 feet with that.
-Yo, man, bust that shit!


829
1:12:40,536 --> 1:12:44,707
-By the time they fix it, it'd be next month.
-No, dog, l'm gonna play it straight.


830
1:12:44,707 --> 1:12:49,278
-How long you in house arrest?
-Four months.


831
1:12:49,278 --> 1:12:52,348
Shit. Damn.


832
1:12:52,348 --> 1:12:59,689
Hey, Pook. How the hell you get out?


833
1:12:59,689 --> 1:13:1,557
Shit.


834
1:13:1,557 --> 1:13:4,96
Boss, Cook County's bad, man.


835
1:13:4,96 --> 1:13:7,63
But Stateville....


836

You're different.

Hey, how you doing, Miss Yvonne?


853
1:14:16,332 --> 1:14:22,805
Yeah. All that shit hits you at one time.


854
1:14:22,805 --> 1:14:26,308
Remember my homeboy, Alex?


855
1:14:26,308 --> 1:14:30,312
-He dead.
-Yeah?


856
1:14:30,312 --> 1:14:33,783
Carl got shot. He dead.
He was in boot camp like you.


857
1:14:33,783 --> 1:14:36,485
Went back to hustling.


858
1:14:36,485 --> 1:14:40,923
What's that motherfucker with the
nappy-ass head and the Mexican girlfriend?


859
1:14:40,923 --> 1:14:46,28
-You talking about Jamie, right?
-Yeah, he dead.


860
1:14:46,28 --> 1:14:49,365

1:14:49,365 --> 1:14:51,333
But that was AlDS, though.


862
1:14:51,333 --> 1:14:56,305
Hey man, did you fuck her?


863
1:14:56,305 --> 1:14:59,375
Yeah, me neither.


864
1:14:59,375 --> 1:15:5,8
Hey, whip out the cream.


865
1:15:5,8 --> 1:15:7,95
-Welcome back, player.
-Good to be back, my man.


866
1:15:7,95 --> 1:15:9,385
Boss Dog.


867
1:15:9,385 --> 1:15:13,522
Ta-dow.

-Be safe, man.
-Yeah, man.


869
1:15:15,57 --> 1:15:32,608
Stay up.


870
1:15:32,608 --> 1:15:36,712
''With warmest thanks from your Niota
family. You'll never be forgotten.


871
1:15:36,712 --> 1:15:38,681
''Signed, Sharon.''


872
1:15:38,681 --> 1:15:40,883
She was the cook.


873
1:15:40,883 --> 1:15:43,485
They sent pictures.


874
1:15:43,485 --> 1:15:46,789
See, there's the church we used to eat in.


875
1:15:46,789 --> 1:15:49,191
Oh, every day was like Thanksgiving, boy.


876
1:15:49,191 --> 1:15:54,763
They had this catfish, used to fry it whole
without the head. lt was good.


877
1:15:54,763 --> 1:15:58,467
Wasn't nothing as good
as your cooking though, Mama.


878
1:15:58,467 --> 1:16:2,171
People was thanking us every day,
thanking us for this, thank you for that.


879
1:16:2,171 --> 1:16:5,941
We had a cadence we used to sing.
Y'all wanna hear it?


880
1:16:5,941 --> 1:16:7,843
Yeah.


881
1:16:7,843 --> 1:16:9,44
Please?


882
1:16:9,44 --> 1:16:15,184
-Could we please hear the song?
-Come on, let's hear it.


883
1:16:15,184 --> 1:16:18,888
''They say in Niota,
the people's mighty fine.


884
1:16:18,888 --> 1:16:22,258
''Feed us twice a day,
so now you're friends of mine.


885
1:16:22,258 --> 1:16:26,695
''Oh, won't let you flood,
'cause there's lots of love.


886
1:16:26,695 --> 1:16:30,766
''Ooh, ooh, ooh, hya!''


887
1:16:30,766 --> 1:16:33,435
Y'all in jail wasn't singing about no love.


888
1:16:33,435 --> 1:16:36,438
We was. lf you were there,
you'd have been singing, too.


889
1:16:36,438 --> 1:16:43,379
l know they didn't have no fish like mine.
But it's nice they sent you that card.


890
1:16:43,379 --> 1:16:47,549
My mama had an interview with her boss.
You were never in.


891
1:16:47,549 --> 1:16:50,886
You didn't get back to me.
l couldn't get the anklet turned off...


892
1:16:50,886 --> 1:16:58,394
-...they had to cancel the interview--
-Who's that? Give me the phone.


893
1:16:58,394 --> 1:17:1,13
Yes, is this his parole officer?


894
1:17:1,13 --> 1:17:3,866
Ma'am, why can't my son
ever get a hold of you?


895
1:17:3,866 --> 1:17:6,669
And why can't he go to the library
and get some books?


896
1:17:6,669 --> 1:17:12,274
He likes to read
and he wants to do some job research.


897
1:17:12,274 --> 1:17:15,477
You don't want him to get into trouble?
He had discipline...


898
1:17:15,477 --> 1:17:18,681
...and a lot of activity at boot camp.
He came back all gung ho.


899
1:17:18,681 --> 1:17:21,617
Now you force him
to be idle for four months?


900
1:17:21,617 --> 1:17:25,721
Don't you think
that's a little counterproductive--


901
1:17:25,721 --> 1:17:37,433
Thank you.


902
1:17:37,433 --> 1:17:39,535
There it is.


903
1:17:39,535 --> 1:17:48,277
Ta-dow.


904
1:17:48,277 --> 1:17:52,448
Hey yo, Boss Dog!


905
1:17:52,448 --> 1:18:6,495
What's up, player? Yo, come here, man!


906
1:18:6,495 --> 1:18:10,99
-So you out, huh?
-Yeah. Let's take this ride, player.


907
1:18:10,99 --> 1:18:13,335
Yo, l just got this anklet off.
l only got two hours.


908
1:18:13,335 --> 1:18:15,137
l'll drop you off.


909
1:18:15,137 --> 1:18:26,281
Why you tripping? Come on, man.


910
1:18:26,281 --> 1:18:28,283
Trick or treat, motherfucker.


911
1:18:28,283 --> 1:18:34,56
-This is my nigger, Boss Dog.
-What's up, man?


912
1:18:34,56 --> 1:18:35,657
Where to?


913
1:18:35,657 --> 1:18:40,329
-l got to go to the library.
-Library? What's the fuck up with that?


914
1:18:40,329 --> 1:18:42,398
Shit, there go Laverne.


915
1:18:42,398 --> 1:18:44,833
She know you out yet?


916
1:18:44,833 --> 1:18:49,638
Laverne! Look who l got here, baby!


917
1:18:49,638 --> 1:18:53,976
Damn, she's slamming.


918
1:18:53,976 --> 1:18:58,747
-That thing can't do shit with speed.
-l show you what this motherfucker can do.


919
1:18:58,747 --> 1:19:1,517
-Bring it on, goddammit.
-Let me go.


920
1:19:1,517 --> 1:19:32,815
-Watch this bitch.
-Ta-dow.


921
1:19:32,815 --> 1:19:35,417
Why you ain't go with them?


922
1:19:35,417 --> 1:19:38,52
Why go with them
when l could be here with you?


923
1:19:38,52 --> 1:19:41,29
Why you ain't call me?


924
1:19:41,29 --> 1:19:43,759
l don't know. l hear things.


925
1:19:43,759 --> 1:19:46,462
You think l was gonna wait?


926
1:19:46,462 --> 1:19:52,868
-Just saying you didn't write me--
-l don't write no one.


927
1:19:52,868 --> 1:19:54,77
Your hair looks different.


928
1:19:54,77 --> 1:19:57,206
You like it?


929
1:19:57,206 --> 1:19:58,607
lt's pretty.


930
1:19:58,607 --> 1:20:1,543
People say you think you better
than everybody else now.


931
1:20:1,543 --> 1:20:3,378
You ain't down like you was.


932
1:20:3,378 --> 1:20:6,915
You wanna be just another fool
can't get no job.


933
1:20:6,915 --> 1:20:8,984
Do l look like a fool?


934
1:20:8,984 --> 1:20:11,92
l gotta go.


935
1:20:11,92 --> 1:20:14,356
Can't be seen
with a nigger with no money?


936
1:20:14,356 --> 1:20:19,761
Straight out, Greg?
l'm the same, even if you ain't.


937
1:20:19,761 --> 1:20:22,297
l'm the same, too.


938
1:20:22,297 --> 1:20:33,375
Just ain't hustling, that's all.


939
1:20:33,375 --> 1:21:3,939
l gotta get my hair done.


940
1:21:3,939 --> 1:21:17,753
Feels lighter.


941
1:21:17,753 --> 1:21:21,156
They're long, but they were on sale.


942
1:21:21,156 --> 1:21:26,995
l got you some shoes.


943
1:21:26,995 --> 1:21:31,166
They're durable.


944
1:21:31,166 --> 1:21:33,635
A nice white shirt.


945
1:21:33,635 --> 1:21:59,294
Ta-dow.


946
1:21:59,294 --> 1:22:3,332
''Now's the time for something new


947
1:22:3,332 --> 1:22:6,969
''There ain't nothing you can't do''


948
1:22:6,969 --> 1:22:9,771
You tell them the truth, straight out.


949
1:22:9,771 --> 1:22:12,207
Don't hide nothing.


950
1:22:12,207 --> 1:22:16,578
Think positive.


951
1:22:16,578 --> 1:22:22,584
Look at yourself.


952
1:22:22,584 --> 1:22:27,889
-What are you looking for?
-Anything.


953
1:22:27,889 --> 1:22:29,925
What kind of salary?


954
1:22:29,925 --> 1:22:32,16
Minimum wage, anything.


955
1:22:32,16 --> 1:22:34,363
What was your last job?


956
1:22:34,363 --> 1:22:35,464
Burger King.


957
1:22:35,464 --> 1:22:38,367
-When was that?
-'91.


958
1:22:38,367 --> 1:22:40,2
What've you been doing since?


959
1:22:40,2 --> 1:22:43,972
l've been in a boot camp for young men
headed down the wrong road.


960
1:22:43,972 --> 1:22:46,742
What did you get arrested for?


961
1:22:46,742 --> 1:22:49,945
Selling drugs.


962
1:22:49,945 --> 1:22:52,614
l completed my high school GED
with honors.


963
1:22:52,614 --> 1:23:0,822
l also have a recommendation from
the superintendent of the boot camp.


964
1:23:0,822 --> 1:23:4,126
What kind of drugs did you sell?


965
1:23:4,126 --> 1:23:8,597
Heroin.


966
1:23:8,597 --> 1:23:12,734
Why don't you try back in about a week?


967
1:23:12,734 --> 1:23:20,942
Thank you very much.


968
1:23:20,942 --> 1:23:25,781
lf you have any openings,
my number's on the application.


969
1:23:25,781 --> 1:23:46,601
Thank you.


970
1:23:46,601 --> 1:23:50,72
l was wondering if you needed any help.


971
1:23:50,72 --> 1:23:53,709
Maybe in the kitchen.
l could wash dishes, be a short-order cook.


972
1:23:53,709 --> 1:23:55,143
l'll do anything.


973
1:23:55,143 --> 1:23:59,247
l don't need any help.
Part-time, full-time, no-time.


974
1:23:59,247 --> 1:24:5,2
Thank you.


975
1:24:5,2 --> 1:24:8,957
-Can't get nothing.
-Just a goddamn nigger to them.


976
1:24:8,957 --> 1:24:12,694
They don't want you to open the door
for them, messenger for them...


977
1:24:12,694 --> 1:24:16,131
...pour their watery-ass coffee
for them, nothin'.


978
1:24:16,131 --> 1:24:20,68
That's why l ain't gonna drag my ass
down to no motherfucking job interview...


979
1:24:20,68 --> 1:24:25,44
...and ask them for some bullshit
they ain't never gonna give me.


980
1:24:25,44 --> 1:24:29,678
They give the sisters work. That's cool.


981
1:24:29,678 --> 1:24:34,583
They ain't gonna give me no mop
to slop their shit with.


982
1:24:34,583 --> 1:24:36,918
l don't have your fucking money.


983
1:24:36,918 --> 1:24:42,924
Man, ain't one brother out here got a job.


984
1:24:42,924 --> 1:24:44,626
My homeboy, Lovell.


985
1:24:44,626 --> 1:24:49,131
He down there at the Hyatt Regency
making about $6.40 an hour.


986
1:24:49,131 --> 1:24:54,703
He ain't never been in prison, man.
He ain't got no arrest sheet.


987
1:24:54,703 --> 1:25:0,409
Out of all the motherfuckers you begged to
give you a shit job, was there one brother?


988
1:25:0,409 --> 1:25:2,577
Hell, no.


989
1:25:2,577 --> 1:25:8,49
Not one goddamn nigger
got a job to give us.


990
1:25:8,49 --> 1:25:11,887
Check out Jason's brother.
He owns that funeral parlor.


991
1:25:11,887 --> 1:25:14,322
Only legit business around
that makes money.


992
1:25:14,322 --> 1:25:20,695
l already did, dog.
Got a motherfucking waiting list.


993
1:25:20,695 --> 1:25:23,131
-Believe that shit?
-That's bullshit.


994
1:25:23,131 --> 1:25:27,135
-Fucking waiting list at a funeral parlor.
-Straight up, man.


995
1:25:27,135 --> 1:25:41,55
You know you always
got a job with me, right?


996
1:25:41,55 --> 1:25:47,22
Hey, bitch!


997
1:25:47,22 --> 1:25:59,334
Motherfucker, l'm tired of your ass!


998
1:25:59,334 --> 1:26:3,438
What's up, boss, my man?
l heard you was out.


999
1:26:3,438 --> 1:26:6,441
Didn't even try to contact me?
What's up with that?


1000
1:26:6,441 --> 1:26:9,344
l heard you squaring up on me.


1001
1:26:9,344 --> 1:26:11,446
How your job search?


1002
1:26:11,446 --> 1:26:16,51
-lt's all right.
-You got a job?


1003
1:26:16,51 --> 1:26:20,255
Ain't all right, then.
l hate to see you like this, homey.


1004
1:26:20,255 --> 1:26:23,859
How much longer can you take
this poor-man shit?


1005
1:26:23,859 --> 1:26:27,496
Who's paying your health for you?


1006
1:26:27,496 --> 1:26:31,199
Getting over on your mom?


1007
1:26:31,199 --> 1:26:35,37
-She pick out your clothes for you, too?
-l don't work for you no more.


1008
1:26:35,37 --> 1:26:39,674
l ain't asking you for shit.
Matter of fact, get the fuck outta my face.


1009
1:26:39,674 --> 1:26:44,513
Damn, l didn't know it was bad as all that.
You'll be all right.


1010
1:26:44,513 --> 1:26:53,355
Gorgeous, come here.


1011
1:26:53,355 --> 1:26:58,36
What's up, Greg?


1012
1:26:58,36 --> 1:27:3,64
Tell you what, let me know
when you wanna work just one day.


1013
1:27:3,64 --> 1:27:7,736
Put some papers in your pocket,
me and you can go out and kick it.


1014
1:27:7,736 --> 1:27:32,761
l gotta tell you, don't look like you had
yourself no fun in a long goddamn time.


1015
1:27:32,761 --> 1:27:35,897
You have to hang in there.


1016
1:27:35,897 --> 1:27:40,435
What you think l been doing?


1017
1:27:40,435 --> 1:27:42,904
l been out every day, all day...


1018
1:27:42,904 --> 1:27:46,608
...looking for a job, any kind of job,
for three months now.


1019
1:27:46,608 --> 1:27:49,411
l haven't had an interview in two weeks.


1020
1:27:49,411 --> 1:27:53,615
-Ain't nobody wanna hire me.
-Something will come up.


1021
1:27:53,615 --> 1:27:57,85
Mama, this ain't the '70s.


1022
1:27:57,85 --> 1:28:1,456
You can't just walk out there and get a job.


1023
1:28:1,456 --> 1:28:5,594
Ain't nobody gonna hire me
unless l tell 'em l been to college or....


1024
1:28:5,594 --> 1:28:9,364
l know guys never been to prison
and still can't get a job.


1025
1:28:9,364 --> 1:28:12,33
They catch you lying and that's it.


1026
1:28:12,33 --> 1:28:15,17
This is it now, don't you understand?


1027
1:28:15,17 --> 1:28:17,305
l'm a grown man and l live with my mama!


1028
1:28:17,305 --> 1:28:23,411
l can't get a damn job!
You think l wanna be here?


1029
1:28:23,411 --> 1:28:25,8
This is it.


1030
1:28:25,8 --> 1:28:28,383
This is bullshit! All of it, it's bullshit!


1031
1:28:28,383 --> 1:28:32,721
Wait a minute.


1032
1:28:32,721 --> 1:28:37,826
''Bullshit?''


1033
1:28:37,826 --> 1:28:39,16
This...


1034
1:28:39,16 --> 1:28:43,932
...what you just did, is bullshit.


1035
1:28:43,932 --> 1:28:47,936
This is who you are.


1036
1:28:47,936 --> 1:28:50,171
This is what you accomplished.


1037
1:28:50,171 --> 1:28:56,578
Now, you go and get what's yours.


1038
1:28:56,578 --> 1:28:59,514
You're a man.


1039
1:28:59,514 --> 1:29:1,95
A man like who?


1040
1:29:1,95 --> 1:29:4,452
Who you trying to be like, baby?


1041
1:29:4,452 --> 1:29:6,421
Like your father?


1042
1:29:6,421 --> 1:29:10,91
l'm not gonna let you be the man
your father was.


1043
1:29:10,91 --> 1:29:13,361
l don't need another dead man.


1044
1:29:13,361 --> 1:29:17,866
l am not gonna have you
give up and die on me, too, goddammit.


1045
1:29:17,866 --> 1:29:22,971
l am not going to let you die.


1046
1:29:22,971 --> 1:29:26,875
This is what we're gonna do.


1047
1:29:26,875 --> 1:29:29,644
Now...


1048
1:29:29,644 --> 1:29:35,717
...you're gonna go down there
to them employment people again.


1049
1:29:35,717 --> 1:29:38,953
You're gonna look them in the eye...


1050
1:29:38,953 --> 1:29:42,357
...and you're gonna tell them the truth.


1051
1:29:42,357 --> 1:29:44,526
Step up, baby...


1052
1:29:44,526 --> 1:29:48,296
...and tell them who you are.


1053
1:29:48,296 --> 1:29:50,965
You are Greg Yance...


1054
1:29:50,965 --> 1:29:58,239
...and you are not going to die.


1055
1:29:58,239 --> 1:30:2,444
Can l tell you about
my experience down there?


1056
1:30:2,444 --> 1:30:4,879
l worked 18 hours a day...


1057
1:30:4,879 --> 1:30:6,548
...for $3 a week.


1058
1:30:6,548 --> 1:30:10,151
Throwing sandbags from dawn to dusk.


1059
1:30:10,151 --> 1:30:15,256
Stepping in water with snakes
and all types of insects l never seen before.


1060
1:30:15,256 --> 1:30:17,659
We worked in 110-degree heat.


1061
1:30:17,659 --> 1:30:20,628
Uniform soaked.


1062
1:30:20,628 --> 1:30:24,566
Feet blistered, hands raw,
mosquito bites all over my body.


1063
1:30:24,566 --> 1:30:29,437
After we finished, we'd still have to do
our P.T., that's physical training.


1064
1:30:29,437 --> 1:30:33,274
Stomach crunches and pushups
and jumping jacks.


1065
1:30:33,274 --> 1:30:36,878
Then we'd still have to jog
three miles a day.


1066
1:30:36,878 --> 1:30:40,815
l know that may sound like
a nightmare to you, but....


1067
1:30:40,815 --> 1:30:45,72
Throwing sandbags on that levee
was the best job l've ever had.


1068
1:30:45,72 --> 1:30:49,57
The people there...


1069
1:30:49,57 --> 1:30:51,826
...they made us feel like we had a purpose.


1070
1:30:51,826 --> 1:30:57,665
We made a difference and they thanked us.


1071
1:30:57,665 --> 1:31:0,702
l'm a hard worker,
l like backbreaking work.


1072
1:31:0,702 --> 1:31:5,106
l work good with my hands.


1073
1:31:5,106 --> 1:31:8,576
l'll work on the outside
and start at the bottom.


1074
1:31:8,576 --> 1:31:14,949
Making $3 an hour would be
a very big accomplishment for me.


1075
1:31:14,949 --> 1:31:16,885
l'm just asking you.


1076
1:31:16,885 --> 1:31:21,589
Please, could you look for anything?


1077
1:31:21,589 --> 1:31:31,366
Just anything. l'm willing to work.


1078
1:31:31,366 --> 1:31:50,485
l'm sorry, we just don't have anything
for you right now.


1079
1:31:50,485 --> 1:31:52,987
What's wrong? You tripping me out.


1080
1:31:52,987 --> 1:31:58,626
Shit, ain't nothing,
everything just going in slow motion.


1081
1:31:58,626 --> 1:32:0,728
-You know something?
-What's that?


1082
1:32:0,728 --> 1:32:5,333
For a minute, l thought l wouldn't
end up hustling for the rest of my life.


1083
1:32:5,333 --> 1:32:7,502
For me, there ain't nothing else.


1084
1:32:7,502 --> 1:32:10,171
Especially seeing
what your ass is going through.


1085
1:32:10,171 --> 1:32:14,542
Shit.


1086
1:32:14,542 --> 1:32:17,846
When you wanna start?


1087
1:32:17,846 --> 1:32:20,715
