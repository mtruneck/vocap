0:0:4,299 --> 0:0:13,689
Seven decades ago, in March 1940, the author
John Steinbeck and his friend, marine biologist


2
0:0:13,689 --> 0:0:23,7
Ed Ricketts, sailed down the coast of California
and Mexico to the Sea of Cortez.


3
0:0:23,7 --> 0:0:38,649
"The abundance of life here gives one an exuberance,"
they wrote, "a feeling of fullness and richness."


4
0:0:38,649 --> 0:0:44,67
Their stated purpose was to document the creatures
that inhabit shallow waters and tide pools


5
0:0:44,67 --> 0:0:48,0
on the margins of the Sea of Cortez.


6
0:0:48,0 --> 0:0:55,359
But it became much more.


7
0:0:55,359 --> 0:1:1,109
In these mysterious, phosphorescent waters
they sought an understanding of mankind's


8
0:1:1,109 --> 0:1:12,43
relationship to the natural world, and a wellspring
of hope for a world headed toward war.


9
0:1:12,43 --> 0:1:18,47
Looking beyond the events of the day, the
two friends foresaw our rising impact on the


10
0:1:18,47 --> 0:1:27,29
oceans, and the devastating impact that over
fishing would have on this rich sea.


11
0:1:27,29 --> 0:1:32,42
And yet, in their journey, they encountered
a periodic cooling of the eastern Pacific


12
0:1:32,42 --> 0:1:40,88
Ocean known as La Ni–a that can still set
off an explosion of life.


13
0:1:40,88 --> 0:2:4,21
Can the story of their journey inspire new
efforts to preserve the Sea of Cortez?


14
0:2:4,21 --> 0:2:14,9
Down along the shores of western Mexico, the
wind blows hot and dry.


15
0:2:14,9 --> 0:2:25,86
Beyond these barren landscapes, cold currents
rush up from the deep, and the ocean literally


16
0:2:25,86 --> 0:2:36,87
boils with life.


17
0:2:36,87 --> 0:2:43,3
Following their journey down to the Sea of
Cortez in March of 1940, John Steinbeck and


18
0:2:43,3 --> 0:2:48,97
Ed Ricketts searched for a way to describe
what they saw.


19
0:2:48,97 --> 0:2:59,5
"Trying to remember this place," they wrote,
"is like trying to re-create a dream. It is


20
0:2:59,5 --> 0:3:8,59
fierce and hostile and sullen. The stone mountains
pile up to the sky and there is little fresh


21
0:3:8,59 --> 0:3:21,62
water. But we know we must go back if we live,
and we don't know why."


22
0:3:21,62 --> 0:3:37,4
The Sea of Cortez is one of the most diverse
marine ecosystems on the planet. It's shaped


23
0:3:37,4 --> 0:3:48,9
by the cool waters of the California Current
flowing into the warm tropics, and by a complex


24
0:3:48,9 --> 0:3:56,78
undersea terrain that rises up along a chain
of islands and seamounts.


25
0:3:56,78 --> 0:4:2,78
It was the shorelines, between the desert
and the deep, that drew John Steinbeck, the


26
0:4:2,78 --> 0:4:11,37
author, and Ed Ricketts, a marine biologist
and expert on coastal ecosystems.


27
0:4:11,37 --> 0:4:20,199
Ricketts' book, "Between Pacific Tides," is
a classic study of the inter-tidal zones of


28
0:4:20,199 --> 0:4:29,689
the California coastline... and the myriad
creatures that live in shallow pools, clinging


29
0:4:29,689 --> 0:4:37,84
to rocks to sift the rich nutrients carried
in by the tides.


30
0:4:37,84 --> 0:4:43,84
Steinbeck and Ricketts sought to extend this
work to the Sea of Cortez and to explore ideas


31
0:4:43,84 --> 0:4:50,77
at the core of their friendship.


32
0:4:50,77 --> 0:4:56,569
They shared a belief that man's fate, like
that of the animals they saw, is linked to


33
0:4:56,569 --> 0:5:1,689
the health of the natural world.


34
0:5:1,689 --> 0:5:7,319
Ricketts is said to have inspired some of
Steinbeck's most memorable characters, including


35
0:5:7,319 --> 0:5:14,11
Doc in Cannery Row, and the preacher Jim Casy
in The Grapes of Wrath, published a year before


36
0:5:14,11 --> 0:5:18,589
their voyage.


37
0:5:18,589 --> 0:5:24,27
Set against the backdrop of drought and economic
depression, the book describes the dustbowl


38
0:5:24,27 --> 0:5:29,89
conditions that gripped the American heartland
in the 1930s.


39
0:5:29,89 --> 0:5:37,4
"Now the wind grew strong and hard and it
worked at the rain crust in the corn fields.


40
0:5:37,4 --> 0:5:43,61
Little by little the sky was darkened by the
mixing dust, and carried away. The wind grew


41
0:5:43,61 --> 0:5:50,55
stronger. The rain crust broke and the dust
lifted up out of the fields and drove gray


42
0:5:50,55 --> 0:5:52,949
plumes into the air like sluggish smoke."


43
0:5:52,949 --> 0:6:1,569
In most years, southerly winds carry moisture
into the midsection of the country from the


44
0:6:1,569 --> 0:6:3,759
Gulf of Mexico.


45
0:6:3,759 --> 0:6:11,29
In the 1930s, according to a recent NASA study,
those winds were diverted by a build up of


46
0:6:11,29 --> 0:6:17,18
warm water in the Western Atlantic, and by
a periodic cooling of the Eastern Pacific


47
0:6:17,18 --> 0:6:20,33
known as La Ni–a.


48
0:6:20,33 --> 0:6:26,749
This combination robbed the region of rain.


49
0:6:26,749 --> 0:6:32,33
By the time Steinbeck and Ricketts began their
journey, the historic backdrop had shifted


50
0:6:32,33 --> 0:6:44,659
to war. Fighting had engulfed Europe and was
spreading to the western Pacific.


51
0:6:44,659 --> 0:6:51,49
While the United States was still officially
neutral, American companies had begun supplying


52
0:6:51,49 --> 0:7:1,96
arms to the allied effort.


53
0:7:1,96 --> 0:7:8,149
In early 1940, John Steinbeck used money he
earned from "The Grapes of Wrath" to hire


54
0:7:8,149 --> 0:7:15,249
a sardine boat called the Western Flyer.


55
0:7:15,249 --> 0:7:23,159
From Monterrey, California, he, his wife Carol,
Ed Ricketts and a four-man crew headed south,


56
0:7:23,159 --> 0:7:30,71
charting a course along the Mexican coastline.


57
0:7:30,71 --> 0:7:38,68
By all accounts, the journey was filled with
adventure, camaraderie, and a sense of wonder


58
0:7:38,68 --> 0:7:46,259
at the diversity of living things they encountered.


59
0:7:46,259 --> 0:7:52,969
Over a six-week period, the two friends wrote
journal entries, took notes on conversations,


60
0:7:52,969 --> 0:7:57,759
and catalogued specimens they collected on
the way.


61
0:7:57,759 --> 0:8:6,899
They compiled these writings into a book:
"Sea of Cortez, A Leisurely Journal of Travel


62
0:8:6,899 --> 0:8:19,159
and Research," later changed to "The Log From
the Sea of Cortez." The work amounts to a


63
0:8:19,159 --> 0:8:25,99
search for a way to understand nature, and
humanity at large, in a world steadily coming


64
0:8:25,99 --> 0:8:37,289
apart at the seams.


65
0:8:37,289 --> 0:8:43,199
The crew had little to go on in advance of
the journey, for the sparsely populated coastlines


66
0:8:43,199 --> 0:8:48,69
of Baja California had not been studied or
mapped in detail.


67
0:8:48,69 --> 0:9:0,54
"From the information available," the book
says, "a few facts did emerge. The Sea of


68
0:9:0,54 --> 0:9:7,98
Cortez, or the Gulf of California, is a long,
narrow, highly dangerous body of water. It


69
0:9:7,98 --> 0:9:16,769
is subject to sudden and vicious storms of
great intensity."


70
0:9:16,769 --> 0:9:23,639
One book they had read contained accounts
of "ships broken up and scattered, of wrecks


71
0:9:23,639 --> 0:9:34,73
and wayward currents; of 50 miles of sea more
dreaded than any other."


72
0:9:34,73 --> 0:9:40,25
In fact, their route along the coastlines
of Baja California was an obstacle course


73
0:9:40,25 --> 0:9:46,13
of islands and outcroppings.


74
0:9:46,13 --> 0:9:52,66
All along the way, erosion and bone rattling
earthquakes have exposed layers of ancient


75
0:9:52,66 --> 0:10:3,209
bedrock and volcanic flows, offering a window
into the events that long ago shaped the region.


76
0:10:3,209 --> 0:10:9,36
Beginning around 25 million years ago, a giant
section of the Earth's crust, known as the


77
0:10:9,36 --> 0:10:18,579
Pacific Ocean plate, began sliding past and
pulling away from North America.


78
0:10:18,579 --> 0:10:24,529
Deep underground, the friction of rock grinding
against rock fueled the rise of mountains


79
0:10:24,529 --> 0:10:30,199
and volcanoes that now define these rugged
coastlines.


80
0:10:30,199 --> 0:10:37,81
Meanwhile, along a fault line that reaches
north through California, a gash nearly 10,000


81
0:10:37,81 --> 0:10:48,75
feet deep opened in the Earth, now known as
the Gulf of California Rift zone.


82
0:10:48,75 --> 0:10:54,42
From the north, the Sea of Cortez is fed by
melting snow that flows down from the Rocky


83
0:10:54,42 --> 0:11:8,12
Mountains and through the Grand Canyon, and
from the south, by powerful tides that surge


84
0:11:8,12 --> 0:11:20,459
in from the Pacific.


85
0:11:20,459 --> 0:11:26,18
On their way down from Monterrey, the crew
of the Western Flyer passed by a wide diversity


86
0:11:26,18 --> 0:11:30,47
of coastal habitats.


87
0:11:30,47 --> 0:11:42,93
Below the surface, are kelp beds common in
northern waters, and coral reefs that recall


88
0:11:42,93 --> 0:11:49,44
the tropics.


89
0:11:49,44 --> 0:12:6,25
Vast sea grass meadows, and tangled mangrove
swamps, and a network of tidepools and rocky


90
0:12:6,25 --> 0:12:12,11
shallows, teeming with life.


91
0:12:12,11 --> 0:12:16,959
In the sheer density of living things, they
may well have witnessed the extraordinary


92
0:12:16,959 --> 0:12:25,98
flipside of the climatic conditions that created
the Dustbowl.


93
0:12:25,98 --> 0:12:31,81
During the onset of La Ni–a, every three
to six years, strong equatorial winds begin


94
0:12:31,81 --> 0:12:39,509
to blow off the coast of South America, pushing
warm surface waters away, while drawing cold,


95
0:12:39,509 --> 0:12:48,72
nutrient-rich waters up from the deep.


96
0:12:48,72 --> 0:12:57,4
That can fuel an explosion of microscopic
plankton, and in turn, a vast natural melting


97
0:12:57,4 --> 0:13:3,31
pot of marine life.


98
0:13:3,31 --> 0:13:10,12
The two friends interpreted what they saw
using the emerging science of ecology. Ricketts


99
0:13:10,12 --> 0:13:16,55
had been exposed to it in his studies at the
University of Chicago and Steinbeck at Stanford


100
0:13:16,55 --> 0:13:20,97
University's Hopkins Marine Lab.


101
0:13:20,97 --> 0:13:27,68
The idea is that an ecosystem is governed
by complex inter-dependencies between species


102
0:13:27,68 --> 0:13:35,6
and their environments. Scientists have expanded
this notion to include evolution, nutrient


103
0:13:35,6 --> 0:13:39,139
cycling, food webs, and more.


104
0:13:39,139 --> 0:13:45,649
A central idea that appealed to Steinbeck
and Ricketts is that the sum of individual


105
0:13:45,649 --> 0:13:49,269
animals adds up to a greater whole.


106
0:13:49,269 --> 0:14:0,49
Take, for instance, a school of small fish
under attack by a band of sailfish. For individuals


107
0:14:0,49 --> 0:14:5,439
to survive, they must literally come together
as one.


108
0:14:5,439 --> 0:14:12,6
"Their functions in the school," they wrote,
"are in some as yet unknown way as controlled


109
0:14:12,6 --> 0:14:18,699
as though the school were one unit. We cannot
conceive of this intricacy until we are able


110
0:14:18,699 --> 0:14:25,86
to think of the school as an animal itself,
reacting with all its cells to stimuli which


111
0:14:25,86 --> 0:14:37,43
perhaps might not influence one fish at all."


112
0:14:37,43 --> 0:14:42,22
Steinbeck and Rickett's stated mission was
to explore how individuals function within


113
0:14:42,22 --> 0:14:54,249
a group, and how a school or a reef or a tide
pool fits within the greater marine ecosystem.


114
0:14:54,249 --> 0:15:2,87
Rather than find species that were rare or
undiscovered, they set out to document what


115
0:15:2,87 --> 0:15:10,8
was there, then to contemplate its connections
to the wider world.


116
0:15:10,8 --> 0:15:18,62
While the purpose of the trip was to produce
a scientific record, the book they wrote,


117
0:15:18,62 --> 0:15:25,6
according to the scholar Richard Astro, is
a "celebration of this holistic vision, depicted


118
0:15:25,6 --> 0:15:31,889
in terms more mystical and intuitive than
scientific."


119
0:15:31,889 --> 0:15:37,91
This vision came together in their description
of a shore visit to Puerto Escondido, a cove


120
0:15:37,91 --> 0:15:42,389
that today hosts a small marina.


121
0:15:42,389 --> 0:15:50,79
There, some local residents invited them on
a hunt for big-horn sheep.


122
0:15:50,79 --> 0:16:0,49
The hike took them along hillsides lined with
plants adapted to long periods of dryness.


123
0:16:0,49 --> 0:16:6,17
While they never saw any wild sheep, the trek
gave them a chance to look back down at the


124
0:16:6,17 --> 0:16:15,629
Sea and to reflect on the mountains and the
world that envelop it.


125
0:16:15,629 --> 0:16:22,23
They marveled at tiny desert springs, isolated
within the waterless landscape, that were


126
0:16:22,23 --> 0:16:26,449
somehow filled with life.


127
0:16:26,449 --> 0:16:34,47
Likewise, in the ocean, they noted the remarkable
collaboration between invertebrates in the


128
0:16:34,47 --> 0:16:41,49
tasks of gathering food and moving around.


129
0:16:41,49 --> 0:16:48,649
Mysteries like these, they believed, would
yield only to the most expansive view of individual


130
0:16:48,649 --> 0:16:59,54
organisms in relation to countless others,
all nested within the folds of an ocean, a


131
0:16:59,54 --> 0:17:7,11
desert, and a planet.


132
0:17:7,11 --> 0:17:12,51
Many of the great thinkers, they remind us
later in the book, "discovered and reaffirmed


133
0:17:12,51 --> 0:17:19,28
with astonishment the knowledge that all things
are one thing and that one thing is all things


134
0:17:19,28 --> 0:17:31,8
- plankton, a shimmering phosphorescence on
the sea and the spinning planets and an expanding


135
0:17:31,8 --> 0:17:36,75
universe, all bound together by the elastic
string of time."


136
0:17:36,75 --> 0:17:52,35
"It is advisable," they wrote, "to look from
the tide pool to the stars and then back to


137
0:17:52,35 --> 0:17:58,51
the tide pool again."


138
0:17:58,51 --> 0:18:4,2
Within this all-embracing view, they believed,
humans are uniquely capable of understanding


139
0:18:4,2 --> 0:18:10,88
the whole of nature and affecting it.


140
0:18:10,88 --> 0:18:17,17
As isolated and pristine as the Sea of Cortez
might have seemed in 1940, it was still subject


141
0:18:17,17 --> 0:18:23,38
to the intrusions of the wider world.


142
0:18:23,38 --> 0:18:29,45
The two friends reported shrimp boats, for
example, dredging up the sea bottom, "rapidly


143
0:18:29,45 --> 0:18:35,55
destroying the species so that it may never
come back, and with the species destroying


144
0:18:35,55 --> 0:18:43,63
the ecological balance of the whole region.
That isn't very important in the world. And


145
0:18:43,63 --> 0:18:49,26
thousands of miles away the great bombs are
falling and the stars are not moved thereby."


146
0:18:49,26 --> 0:19:0,67
"None of it is important," they wrote, "or
all of it is."


147
0:19:0,67 --> 0:19:7,16
The book they wrote was published over a year
after their journey ended, on December 5th


148
0:19:7,16 --> 0:19:16,94
1941. Two days later, on December 7th, Japanese
bombers descended on Pearl Harbor.


149
0:19:16,94 --> 0:19:23,11
The book was lost in the news of the day,
in a nation and a world moving rapidly toward


150
0:19:23,11 --> 0:19:27,4
World War.


151
0:19:27,4 --> 0:19:35,47
John Steinbeck went on to serve as a war correspondent,
then returned to his literary career.


152
0:19:35,47 --> 0:19:41,63
Ed Ricketts too served in the war as a medical
lab technician for the Army.


153
0:19:41,63 --> 0:19:47,34
He then returned to doing science, with groundbreaking
studies on the sardine fishery in Monterrey


154
0:19:47,34 --> 0:19:52,72
Bay that linked fishing practices to declining
harvests.


155
0:19:52,72 --> 0:20:1,16
In 1948, the two friends were planning another
trip -- to study marine life in the Pacific


156
0:20:1,16 --> 0:20:20,45
Northwest. Tragically, Ed Ricketts was killed
when his car was hit by a passenger train.


157
0:20:20,45 --> 0:20:26,47
The book he authored with John Steinbeck would
echo down the years as commentary on the events


158
0:20:26,47 --> 0:20:34,65
that had shaken the world, and on the world
that would emerge in the aftermath.


159
0:20:34,65 --> 0:20:40,12
Many of Baja California's landscapes and coastlines
are still the way they were before humans


160
0:20:40,12 --> 0:20:43,78
settled there.


161
0:20:43,78 --> 0:20:50,42
But its waters have become the center of a
thriving tourist and sport fishing industry,


162
0:20:50,42 --> 0:20:56,78
and a magnet for large-scale commercial fishing.


163
0:20:56,78 --> 0:21:1,88
Scientists at Scripps Institution of Oceanography
recently conducted a comprehensive survey


164
0:21:1,88 --> 0:21:11,53
of wildlife in the Sea of Cortez. Comparing
what they saw against past surveys, they identified


165
0:21:11,53 --> 0:21:17,5
a series of mounting threats.


166
0:21:17,5 --> 0:21:23,57
Unsustainable water use practices in the Colorado
River basin have damaged many of the estuaries


167
0:21:23,57 --> 0:21:30,75
at its mouth, threatening shrimp and other
fisheries.


168
0:21:30,75 --> 0:21:35,74
Industrial fishing methods have wreaked havoc
on a variety of fish populations.


169
0:21:35,74 --> 0:21:43,44
An example is the deployment of gillnets,
curtains that stretch across miles of ocean


170
0:21:43,44 --> 0:21:52,96
and trap whatever happens to come by.


171
0:21:52,96 --> 0:21:58,58
Another is long-line fishing, in which fishermen
deploy hundreds of baited hooks from lines


172
0:21:58,58 --> 0:22:6,15
of buoys.


173
0:22:6,15 --> 0:22:14,33
These methods have all but eliminated oceanic
predators such as sharks and tuna.


174
0:22:14,33 --> 0:22:25,78
They've decimated some non-target species
such as manta rays.


175
0:22:25,78 --> 0:22:32,1
With many of the traditional fisheries depleted,
the report warns of a practice known as "fishing


176
0:22:32,1 --> 0:22:41,85
down the food web." Teams of divers pick through
the reefs for invertebrates, or lone fish


177
0:22:41,85 --> 0:22:55,72
hiding among the rocks at night. They take
anything they can get.


178
0:22:55,72 --> 0:23:2,46
On their visit to the rocky southern tip of
Baja California, Cabo San Lucas, John Steinbeck


179
0:23:2,46 --> 0:23:10,28
and Ed Ricketts reveled in the diversity of
living things: "the incredible beauty of the


180
0:23:10,28 --> 0:23:22,2
tide pools," "the brilliant colors," "the
swarming species."


181
0:23:22,2 --> 0:23:27,76
Those same tide pools today are covered over
with sand trucked in for the construction


182
0:23:27,76 --> 0:23:31,1
of condos and vacation resorts.


183
0:23:31,1 --> 0:23:40,19
Cabo San Lucas has become a major tourist
destination, with accommodations for over


184
0:23:40,19 --> 0:23:47,97
a million visitors per year in resorts and
hotel chains.


185
0:23:47,97 --> 0:23:53,32
The human presence has introduced a major
new dynamic to the Sea of Cortez that can


186
0:23:53,32 --> 0:23:58,5
be difficult to unravel.


187
0:23:58,5 --> 0:24:4,84
Since the year 2002, the entire eastern pacific
coast, up to Alaska and including the Sea


188
0:24:4,84 --> 0:24:14,12
of Cortez, has experienced the rapid spread
of Humboldt squid. Moving up from the deep


189
0:24:14,12 --> 0:24:25,75
in large numbers, these ferocious hunters
go after a wide variety of prey.


190
0:24:25,75 --> 0:24:37,8
Their overall impact on the food web is largely
unknown. In the Sea of Cortez, they are targets


191
0:24:37,8 --> 0:24:42,8
for fishermen who ride out at night, often
hauling in tons of squid per trip to bring


192
0:24:42,8 --> 0:24:45,41
to market.


193
0:24:45,41 --> 0:24:53,48
A recent study blames the spread of these
squid on a combination of factors, from warming


194
0:24:53,48 --> 0:24:59,55
ocean temperatures, to reduced competition
for food, and the decline of predatory species


195
0:24:59,55 --> 0:25:2,32
like sharks.


196
0:25:2,32 --> 0:25:12,79
The disappearance of sharks is in stark evidence
at a seamount near the Bay of La Paz.


197
0:25:12,79 --> 0:25:18,94
Known as El Bajo, it was once a top destination
for divers hoping to observe the gathering


198
0:25:18,94 --> 0:25:20,48
of hammerhead sharks.


199
0:25:20,48 --> 0:25:28,48
This seamount still attracts a rich array
of sea life.


200
0:25:28,48 --> 0:25:33,73
Today, the big hammerhead schools are a rare
sight.


201
0:25:33,73 --> 0:25:39,2
That's because few things have changed in
the Sea of Cortez as dramatically as the value


202
0:25:39,2 --> 0:25:46,71
of its sharks.


203
0:25:46,71 --> 0:25:55,58
It has exploded in recent years, mainly to
supply the Asian market for shark fin soup.


204
0:25:55,58 --> 0:26:2,81
Traditionally served at weddings in China,
it can fetch up to $100 per bowl.


205
0:26:2,81 --> 0:26:9,41
About half the world trade in shark fins goes
through the port of Hong Kong, a trade estimated


206
0:26:9,41 --> 0:26:19,68
at 38 million sharks annually, that may well
be much higher.


207
0:26:19,68 --> 0:26:31,83
The oceans today are literally being swept
of sharks.


208
0:26:31,83 --> 0:26:38,4
Because they congregate in large numbers,
hammerheads are especially vulnerable.


209
0:26:38,4 --> 0:26:43,82
There's money to be made in a big haul, such
as this one filmed in the Sea of Cortez in


210
0:26:43,82 --> 0:26:46,57
the year 2000.


211
0:26:46,57 --> 0:26:53,4
A fishing boat had encircled a school at a
seamount. With nets designed to haul in large


212
0:26:53,4 --> 0:27:0,81
numbers of tuna, it scooped up dozens of hammerhead
sharks.


213
0:27:0,81 --> 0:27:12,28
Whether for subsistence or industrial-scale
business, fishing is an opportunistic pursuit.


214
0:27:12,28 --> 0:27:21,28
Fishermen take what's there or what they are
able to bring to shore.


215
0:27:21,28 --> 0:27:30,61
Overfishing in the Sea of Cortez is part of
a larger global problem. According to UN estimates,


216
0:27:30,61 --> 0:27:43,3
80% of oceanic fish stocks around the world
are now considered fully or over-exploited.


217
0:27:43,3 --> 0:27:49,22
John Steinbeck and Ed Ricketts had sought
hope, amid a rising tide of war, by crafting


218
0:27:49,22 --> 0:27:58,57
a holistic view of man and nature. In doing
so, they helped supply the philosophical underpinnings


219
0:27:58,57 --> 0:28:4,82
of a broad movement to protect Earth's natural
environments.


220
0:28:4,82 --> 0:28:11,19
That movement is beginning to take hold in
the Sea of Cortez, offering glimmers of hope.


221
0:28:11,19 --> 0:28:20,3
There are new regulations, for example, governing
drift-net and long-line fishing. Some critics


222
0:28:20,3 --> 0:28:30,31
say they don't go far enough. Others say they
are at least a start.


223
0:28:30,31 --> 0:28:36,88
If nothing else, in the Sea of Cortez today,
more divers, sport fishermen, and boaters


224
0:28:36,88 --> 0:28:45,96
are out keeping a watch on things. With the
aid of a Mexican navy diver, this group has


225
0:28:45,96 --> 0:28:57,93
come out to remove a drift net, one step in
restoring a reef to its natural state.


226
0:28:57,93 --> 0:29:4,66
Some places like this are now part of a growing
network of preserves and protected areas,


227
0:29:4,66 --> 0:29:10,67
a hedge against the rising impact of development.


228
0:29:10,67 --> 0:29:16,84
Sailing along the southern tip of Baja, Steinbeck
and Ricketts were struck by the natural desolation


229
0:29:16,84 --> 0:29:24,14
of the shorelines, "dry with strange flat
mountains and rocks torn by dryness, and the


230
0:29:24,14 --> 0:29:29,2
heat shimmer hung over the land even in March."


231
0:29:29,2 --> 0:29:37,49
Here, they visited a reef called Cabo Pulmo,
where swift ocean currents bring in a torrent


232
0:29:37,49 --> 0:29:43,57
of sea life.


233
0:29:43,57 --> 0:29:51,21
In the 1990s, these reefs were considered
overfished and damaged by pollution. Biologists


234
0:29:51,21 --> 0:29:59,58
and local fishermen came together to fight
for and win protected status for Cabo Pulmo.


235
0:29:59,58 --> 0:30:8,23
Today, no fishing is allowed.


236
0:30:8,23 --> 0:30:16,28
The reefs of Cabo Pulmo have since become
a Mecca for divers and a source of large,


237
0:30:16,28 --> 0:30:22,84
mature fish for local fishermen outside the
reserve.


238
0:30:22,84 --> 0:30:29,22
In their visit to Cabo Pulmo, the scientists
at Scripps Institution of Oceanography found


239
0:30:29,22 --> 0:30:35,6
that the sheer weight, or biomass, of fish
here is at least four times that of similar


240
0:30:35,6 --> 0:30:46,6
unprotected reefs. That includes species up
and down the food chain, from plankton feeders


241
0:30:46,6 --> 0:30:53,58
to predators, bottom dwellers to ocean fliers.


242
0:30:53,58 --> 0:30:58,86
Moving north and into the Sea of Cortez, the
crew of the Western Flyer passed by a chain


243
0:30:58,86 --> 0:31:7,72
of volcanic islands, the largest of which
is called Espiritu Santo.


244
0:31:7,72 --> 0:31:16,4
In the year 1535, the Spanish Explorer, Hernan
Cortes, named it Isla de las Perlas, Island


245
0:31:16,4 --> 0:31:25,77
of the Pearls, after rich pearl oyster beds
on its western side.


246
0:31:25,77 --> 0:31:30,95
On the northern end of this chain, a tiny
marine reserve runs down the steep sides of


247
0:31:30,95 --> 0:31:40,58
a group of small islands called Los Islotes.


248
0:31:40,58 --> 0:31:53,34
The islands deflect deep currents that flow
into the Gulf, sending them to the surface.


249
0:31:53,34 --> 0:32:0,12
These nutrient-laden waters fuel an explosion
of microscopic plants and animals.


250
0:32:0,12 --> 0:32:9,23
They in turn draw vast walls of anchovies,
sardines, and other baitfish.


251
0:32:9,23 --> 0:32:14,22
Moving with currents that swirl around it,
these schools wrap the island in a ribbon


252
0:32:14,22 --> 0:32:20,33
of silver.


253
0:32:20,33 --> 0:32:29,48
Large numbers of bait fish help support a
community of predators.


254
0:32:29,48 --> 0:32:35,25
Reserves like this protect wild creatures
from overfishing, but not from a larger cycle


255
0:32:35,25 --> 0:32:43,0
of awakening and dying that defines the Sea
of Cortez.


256
0:32:43,0 --> 0:32:50,5
John Steinbeck and Ed Ricketts sailed into
the cool, rich waters of La Ni–a.


257
0:32:50,5 --> 0:32:59,53
Inevitably, they give way to the warm waters
of El Ni–o.


258
0:32:59,53 --> 0:33:12,39
This climatic shift brings rain to the Baja
Peninsula, along with glimmers of green.


259
0:33:12,39 --> 0:33:18,1
Washing down hillsides and gullies, the rains
deliver a flood of nutrients to shallow lagoons


260
0:33:18,1 --> 0:33:21,94
and mangrove swamps.


261
0:33:21,94 --> 0:33:27,77
Within the protective shelter of mangrove
roots, young yellow snappers and other fish


262
0:33:27,77 --> 0:33:30,22
can now grow and mature.


263
0:33:30,22 --> 0:33:41,9
Out at sea, El Ni–o is a time of scarcity.
The influx of warm water stifles the upwelling


264
0:33:41,9 --> 0:33:51,76
of nutrients. The Sea of Cortez can then grow
fallow, turning clear and lifeless.


265
0:33:51,76 --> 0:33:58,2
That can wreak havoc on some critical habitats,
including dense forests of sargassum, or brown


266
0:33:58,2 --> 0:34:3,44
algae, that grow along the shorelines.


267
0:34:3,44 --> 0:34:12,62
A wide variety of fish use them as a refuge
in their early stages of development. Then,


268
0:34:12,62 --> 0:34:18,25
when wind and waves pull patches of sargassum
from the shore, these fish hitch a ride out


269
0:34:18,25 --> 0:34:22,62
to their ocean habitats.


270
0:34:22,62 --> 0:34:32,129
As sargassum dwindles during El Ni–o, so
do a range of fish populations.


271
0:34:32,129 --> 0:34:38,35
Many ocean creatures are known to travel widely
in pursuit of food supplies that shift with


272
0:34:38,35 --> 0:34:48,1
the seasons or with the climate.


273
0:34:48,1 --> 0:34:55,159
Pacific white-sided dolphins, traveling in
groups up to 100 or more range from the tip


274
0:34:55,159 --> 0:35:5,63
of Baja California in the South to the Bering
Sea near the Arctic in the north .


275
0:35:5,63 --> 0:35:12,6
One study showed that with the onset of warm
El Ni–o waters, these highly mobile predators


276
0:35:12,6 --> 0:35:34,25
adapted by migrating out to cooler seas and
by changing their diet.


277
0:35:34,25 --> 0:35:40,84
Another ocean predator, the Magnificent Frigate
bird, has a strategy that allows it to stay


278
0:35:40,84 --> 0:35:47,24
put in times of scarcity.


279
0:35:47,24 --> 0:35:54,59
Gathering in colonies atop mangrove forests,
it has the longest nesting cycle of any bird.


280
0:35:54,59 --> 0:36:5,46
A frigate male attracts a mate by inflating
a huge red sack on its chest. Once a pair


281
0:36:5,46 --> 0:36:12,4
is made, the couple puts its all into raising
a single chick, incubating, then feeding it


282
0:36:12,4 --> 0:36:23,44
for about a year and even longer in lean El
Ni–o years.


283
0:36:23,44 --> 0:36:30,13
The colony is a busy place as couples take
turns flying out over the ocean in search


284
0:36:30,13 --> 0:36:35,64
of food.


285
0:36:35,64 --> 0:36:40,9
Because frigates lack the oils in their feathers
that would allow them to land on the water,


286
0:36:40,9 --> 0:36:49,94
they stay in flight for days or weeks at a
time, riding wind currents to conserve energy.


287
0:36:49,94 --> 0:36:57,21
Frigates are known to snag flying fish out
of the air, or to steal fish caught by other


288
0:36:57,21 --> 0:37:2,55
birds.


289
0:37:2,55 --> 0:37:12,8
Soaring high above the ocean, they watch for
signs of activity on the surface. If predators


290
0:37:12,8 --> 0:37:19,6
force small fish to the surface, frigates
can swoop down to skillfully pluck them out.


291
0:37:19,6 --> 0:37:29,11
In time, as the warm waters of El Ni–o fade,
the productivity of the Sea of Cortez begins


292
0:37:29,11 --> 0:37:39,39
to rise again.


293
0:37:39,39 --> 0:37:46,1
With the return of La Ni–a, the wind blows
again across the barren shorelines.


294
0:37:46,1 --> 0:38:1,63
Cold water rises up from the deep, laden with
nutrients, and the sea grows cloudy with plankton.


295
0:38:1,63 --> 0:38:7,31
Life returns with a flourish.


296
0:38:7,31 --> 0:38:13,26
John Steinbeck and Ed Ricketts celebrated
the rush of living organisms.


297
0:38:13,26 --> 0:38:19,47
"The sea here swarms with life," they wrote.


298
0:38:19,47 --> 0:38:24,55
"We could see the splashing of great schools
of tuna in the distance where they beat the


299
0:38:24,55 --> 0:38:30,62
water to spray in their millions."


300
0:38:30,62 --> 0:38:37,6
They also noted great schools of giant manta
rays. One crew member tried repeatedly, but


301
0:38:37,6 --> 0:38:47,2
without success, to haul one onto the boat.


302
0:38:47,2 --> 0:38:53,17
While mantas are scarce in the Sea of Cortez
today, their smaller cousins, the mobulas,


303
0:38:53,17 --> 0:38:59,64
are not.


304
0:38:59,64 --> 0:39:6,55
Hundreds swim together in glorious flying
formation, at times rising to the surface


305
0:39:6,55 --> 0:39:16,39
to feed on a dense layer of plankton.


306
0:39:16,39 --> 0:39:25,89
The recent period of La Ni–a shows how productive
the Sea of Cortez can be and offers a glimpse


307
0:39:25,89 --> 0:39:36,24
of what's at stake in efforts to preserve
it for the future.


308
0:39:36,24 --> 0:39:42,19
The abundance of food at the surface has also
drawn the largest fish in the ocean, the whale


309
0:39:42,19 --> 0:39:44,15
shark.


310
0:39:44,15 --> 0:39:55,97
Moving slowly along, they take in big gulps
of water, then filter out zooplankton, krill,


311
0:39:55,97 --> 0:39:58,15
larvae, and even small fish.


312
0:39:58,15 --> 0:40:9,9
At up to 30 tons and 20 meters in length,
adult whale sharks have few natural predators.


313
0:40:9,9 --> 0:40:17,76
They can live up to 70 years, churning along
in plankton-rich seas.


314
0:40:17,76 --> 0:40:23,51
With plankton filling the water column, the
drama of life and death in the Sea of Cortez


315
0:40:23,51 --> 0:40:28,86
reaches a fever pitch.


316
0:40:28,86 --> 0:40:40,94
Predators and prey come together amid the
tangled ruins of a sunken ship.


317
0:40:40,94 --> 0:40:52,22
Out along the Pacific coastline of Baja, the
cool water of La Ni–a has spurred a rarely


318
0:40:52,22 --> 0:41:2,49
seen migration of countless young mola molas.
These so-called ocean sunfish can grow to


319
0:41:2,49 --> 0:41:8,27
three meters long and weigh several tons.


320
0:41:8,27 --> 0:41:14,84
Along the way, parasites hitch a ride.


321
0:41:14,84 --> 0:41:35,48
When that happens, fish swims up along side
bird hoping there's a mutual advantage.


322
0:41:35,48 --> 0:41:42,23
Just on shore, the season has brought a bumper
crop of young sea lions. They are born with


323
0:41:42,23 --> 0:41:48,8
their eyes open and are able to swim soon
after.


324
0:41:48,8 --> 0:41:57,43
While pups may nurse on shore for up to a
year, they begin to eat fish within a few


325
0:41:57,43 --> 0:42:3,19
months.


326
0:42:3,19 --> 0:42:8,619
Along the Pacific coast, just beyond the Sea
of Cortez, the young ones hang out within


327
0:42:8,619 --> 0:42:18,28
the protective shelter of the rocky shoreline.
Here, they learn to interact with other sea


328
0:42:18,28 --> 0:42:29,44
lions, to vocalize, to swim, and hunt.


329
0:42:29,44 --> 0:42:39,18
Being a young sea lion is all about riding
the currents and waves and investigating the


330
0:42:39,18 --> 0:42:46,82
myriad creatures that live in shallow water.


331
0:42:46,82 --> 0:42:55,92
This one finds itself in a game of hide and
seek with a giant damsel fish. The fish is


332
0:42:55,92 --> 0:43:1,21
most likely just defending its territory.


333
0:43:1,21 --> 0:43:20,17
At every turn fish out-maneuvers mammal. But
the sea lion is becoming more and more determined.


334
0:43:20,17 --> 0:43:30,92
In the end, there's only so much frustration
a sea lion will endure.


335
0:43:30,92 --> 0:43:38,86
If you can't eat the fish, you can always
eat sand. It could be to gain extra ballast


336
0:43:38,86 --> 0:43:48,91
for deep dives or to help with digestion.
No one really knows.


337
0:43:48,91 --> 0:44:17,72
When the urge to scratch strikes, a rock with
barnacles is always within reach.


338
0:44:17,72 --> 0:44:28,43
As these young sea lions grow, so do their
appetites. As adults, sea lions move out into


339
0:44:28,43 --> 0:44:34,7
the ocean to forage, sometimes traveling hundreds
of miles.


340
0:44:34,7 --> 0:44:48,49
To observe their full potential as hunters,
you have to follow them out to sea. Near a


341
0:44:48,49 --> 0:44:56,57
seamount, a group of sea lions encounters
a school of small fish. The fish instinctively


342
0:44:56,57 --> 0:45:5,54
pull together, forming a bait ball.


343
0:45:5,54 --> 0:45:11,24
Out here, in the blue water, schools of fish
are targets for predators endowed with blazing


344
0:45:11,24 --> 0:45:22,28
speed and lightning reflexes. Striped marlin
join the attack from below, pinning the school


345
0:45:22,28 --> 0:45:27,7
on the surface.


346
0:45:27,7 --> 0:45:32,92
With their ability to quickly accelerate,
and swim in tight circles, striped marlin


347
0:45:32,92 --> 0:45:38,9
are the dive-bombers of the sea.


348
0:45:38,9 --> 0:45:55,1
The bait ball avoids the agile predators by
turning, dodging, dispersing and coming back


349
0:45:55,1 --> 0:45:57,78
together.


350
0:45:57,78 --> 0:46:10,119
The predators begin to outlast the prey and
pick them off one by one.


351
0:46:10,119 --> 0:46:16,24
Divers report seeing marlin use their bills
to stun their prey, then circle back around


352
0:46:16,24 --> 0:46:20,53
to pick up their prize.


353
0:46:20,53 --> 0:46:25,91
In a survey of fish found in the stomachs
of Marlin caught by fishermen, over half bore


354
0:46:25,91 --> 0:46:34,74
deep marks or cuts.


355
0:46:34,74 --> 0:46:54,14
Another predator now joins the hunt. A Brydes
whale roars in from out of the blue.


356
0:46:54,14 --> 0:46:59,47
In the Sea of Cortez, the strongest reason
for hope may well lie in the hidden treasures


357
0:46:59,47 --> 0:47:3,35
of the sea itself.


358
0:47:3,35 --> 0:47:10,619
In tandem with the shifting climate, the ocean
releases its stores of wealth from places


359
0:47:10,619 --> 0:47:20,74
unknown to people yet well known to creatures
that ply its depths.


360
0:47:20,74 --> 0:47:25,91
Down along a seamount near the mouth of the
Sea of Cortez is a sight that many hope will


361
0:47:25,91 --> 0:47:35,859
one day become commonplace again.


362
0:47:35,859 --> 0:47:42,51
Vague shapes appear in the gray and murky
deep. Perhaps in response to a change in temperature,


363
0:47:42,51 --> 0:48:5,4
or to an ocean flooded with nutrients, a school
of hammerhead sharks suddenly arrives.


364
0:48:5,4 --> 0:48:11,0
To these sharks, equipped to read the magnetic
contours of the sea floor, islands and seamounts


365
0:48:11,0 --> 0:48:34,34
may serve as landmarks, or gathering spots,
for mating and feeding.


366
0:48:34,34 --> 0:48:40,18
John Steinbeck often portrayed his characters
at the lowest points of their lives, struggling


367
0:48:40,18 --> 0:48:47,16
to gain a fresh start against larger forces
at work in the world.


368
0:48:47,16 --> 0:48:52,56
That may well be the case for these sharks
and for the phosphorescent waters of the Sea


369
0:48:52,56 --> 0:49:3,8
of Cortez. John Steinbeck and Ed Ricketts
believed that humanity, with its unique ability


370
0:49:3,8 --> 0:49:10,73
to see the whole, would find a way to preserve
natural scenes like this.


371
0:49:10,73 --> 0:49:19,55
"In spite of overwhelming evidence to the
contrary," they wrote, "the trait of hope


372
0:49:19,55 --> 0:49:28,98
still controls the future, and man, not a
species but a triumphant race, will approach


373
0:49:28,98 --> 0:49:36,59
perfection, and tearing himself free, will
march up the stars and take his place where,


374
0:49:36,59 --> 0:49:43,84
because of his power and virtue, he belongs."


375
0:49:43,84 --> 0:49:51,68
The two friends knew that even their own footprint
would change the Sea of Cortez in small ways,


376
0:49:51,68 --> 0:50:0,26
as they entered its tide pools to collect
specimens, sailed through its channels, or


377
0:50:0,26 --> 0:50:4,5
docked on its shores.


378
0:50:4,5 --> 0:50:13,94
In the years since, mankind's impact on this
already dynamic ecosystem has steadily grown.


379
0:50:13,94 --> 0:50:20,6
And yet more and more of us are coming here,
not to harvest its treasures, but to experience


380
0:50:20,6 --> 0:50:26,29
the sense of discovery, the mystical connection
to the ocean and the earth that the two friends


381
0:50:26,29 --> 0:50:34,41
shared.


382
0:50:34,41 --> 0:50:40,1
On their journey to the Sea of Cortez, they
had lost, they wrote, "the fear and contagion


383
0:50:40,1 --> 0:50:51,74
of war and economic uncertainty. The matters
of great importance we had left were not important."


384
0:50:51,74 --> 0:50:59,609
What they had found instead was the fulfillment
of joining a vital continuum, linking the


385
0:50:59,609 --> 0:51:14,85
humble microcosm of the tide pools to a sea
teeming with life, to the Earth, and to the


386
0:51:14,85 --> 0:51:37,109
universe beyond.
