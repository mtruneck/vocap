###2 The killing of Osama Bin Laden is a failure to me
###6 because the negative retroactions of that will be enormous!
###11 It's the amount of hatred and people
###13 that will die as a result of that.
###16 So the killing of one man never destroys a value system.
###20 It destroys that person, but the value system goes on.
###24 Racism, bigotry, stupidity
###28 are part of the problem. Stupidity means
###31 lack of information regarding certain types of problems.
###35 When you read in a book that revenge is sweet,
###38 and if that takes as a system, it hurts people.
###43 Therefore, all that type of literature has to go.
###47 To the extent that we raise our children
###50 with artificial values, that will produce harm in the future.
###55 You think, "Well they're only children.
###57 I don't think it's that necessary."
###60 Well, war, guns, possession of guns
###65 are partly nurtured by our culture.
###68 And guns give people a sense of power,
###73 a false sense of power. Real sense of power
###77 is delivery of information that's relevant to people.
###81 Of course you don't sense it right away.
###83 You don't feel a glorious feeling doing that.
###87 But really, it's a long term investment.
###90 And all short term investments may appear to solve problems,
###95 but they only perpetuate problems into the future.
###100 A major problem with the world's people today,
###104 is they believe that human values and behavior
###108 and decisions are made within a human being.
###113 Actually this is not the case.
###115 That's a major cause of most the world's problems.
###120 It is the environment they are reared in.
###122 If you cannot understand that, think of the language you use
###127 and the values you have and the attitudes about a 'good old USA'.
###133 If you were brought up in Iran, your value system
###135 would be different. Your language would be different.
###139 Therefore, it is not within the human being to know the difference
###144 between what you would call operant behavior
###147 or useful behavior or useful values.
###150 All your values are inculcated by environment: the books you read,
###156 the motion pictures you see, the role models you have.
###159 Therefore, human beings are not, I repeat this,
###164 are not responsible for their values.
###167 They are learned.
###169 And if you don't understand that,
###172 you should become more familiar with the effects
###174 of environment on human behavior.
###178 The very fact that they used to burn witches in Salem, Massachusetts,
###182 might mean that within that area,
###186 most people were brought up with such a value system.
###189 The notions of heaven and hell come from books and other people.
###194 Your language comes from your environment.
###197 Possibly the difference between a Roman and a Greek
###201 would be the environment they are reared in.
###204 If you don't understand that,
###206 you need a lot of education, a lot of information,
###209 and you'll have to seek it.
###212 We have to seek information that's relevant to people,
###217 not information based upon opinions, folkways,
###220 hand-down values or feelings of 'good' and 'bad'.
###225 All those feelings of good, bad, right and wrong are all learned.
###230 Everything is learned.
###232 If you still don't understand that
###234 look back at the words you use, and you'll find
###239 that they're words that you've picked up from your environment.
###242 An Englishman speaks with an English accent,
###245 not because he's English, but because he's been exposed
###248 to that environment and those sounds of words.
###252 An Australian speaks like an Australian
###255 because he's brought up in an environment that utilizes that dialog.
###260 A southerner speaks different than a northerner.
###264 And if you still don't understand that, that's the best I can do.
###269 We reflect our culture.
###272 Osama Bin Laden is dead.
###275 But the value system that produced him is not.
###279 It is quite alive.
###282 That goes for the Nazis,
###286 the Klu Klux Klan, the White Citizens Council.
###290 The value system is still alive.
###293 What is needed is not assassinations,
###296 not murder, not killing.
###299 No armies or navies to solve problems.
###303 What is really needed is a change in our values.
###307 I believe in the Bible you'll find
###310 a section where Jesus Christ mentions,
###314 "He who is without sin,
###317 let him cast the first stone."
###320 I don't know what the word 'sin' means, but I do know this.
###324 Erroneous values can cause
###327 unbelievable suffering amongst people.
###332 And we, our nation, like other nations
###335 are mainly like children, that do not have answers,
###340 that do not have solutions to problems.
###344 Whereby, many solutions are violent
###347 and they do not solve problems.
###349 What is really needed is a change in values,
###354 not the election of this governor or that governor.
###359 There's no change in values in that.
###362 By change in values I mean living in accordance with
###366 the natural capacity,
###368 that is, the carrying capacity of the earth.
###371 And if we violate that, there are all kinds of problems.
###376 When you violate the laws of nature,
###379 which are really inviolable,
###382 they will produce other negative effects.
###385 We don't study what the negative retroaction will be
###389 on the assassination of Osama Bin Laden,
###393 but we're building a catalog of problems up ahead.
###397 I think that the solution to problems take longer.
###401 Of course, a sane solution takes many years.
###405 And that is, to arrive at a value system
###410 that supports nature, the earth
###412 and all the people that live on this earth.
###416 If they all go off in different directions
###418 and evolve different value systems,
###421 there's got to be trouble,
###423 and you cannot solve problems by killing people.
###427 Although most of you believe that 'revenge is sweet'.
###431 It is only sweet to the naive and childlike attitudes
###436 whereby we feel good when we get rid of a certain person
###440 identified with the problem.
###443 That does not solve the problem.
###446 If you yourselves as Americans,
###448 were brought up in that country where those values are dominant,
###453 you will support those values.
###455 It isn't killing people that solves problems.
###458 It's outgrowing values that no longer work,
###462 and this is what we have to identify.
###465 If you cannot identify the values that do not work,
###469 you cannot undo them.
###471 Only through education can we change human values.
###477 And what we have to do is approach nations
###480 and share with them some of our values, if we can.
###484 And if you don't know how to do that, you have to find
###487 the means for doing that.
###489 It is absolutely essential that we find the means
###494 for bridging the difference between nations.
###497 And the nearest thing that I know of
###500 that can solve those problems
###503 is to arrive at decisions, rather than make them.
###507 Arriving at decisions meaning
###510 put all your decisions to test, see if they work.
###514 Use scientific scales of performance.
###517 And in that manner, we can probably arrive at
###521 closer agreements with nations.
###524 I believe that all nations need the same thing :
###528 clean air, clean water, arable land,
###533 and medical and health security,
###536 and access to food and the necessities of life.
###540 If we fail to work together,
###544 attempting to solve these problems,
###546 I feel the problems will continue
###549 in much more vicious ways,
###552 because we are not touching, or not addressing
###556 the actual manifestation
###559 of how these values come into being.
###563 And it's only through careful study, not feelings of revenge,
###567 careful study, that will enable people
###570 to outgrow systems that are no longer relevant.
###575 What is needed is a value system
###578 that coincides with the nature of human need.
###583 Now not only that, but humans are part of the environment.
###587 Therefore, the environment is part of human needs,
###590 whether we recognize it or not.
###593 Another part of human need is the differences in values.
###597 If people all have multiplicity of values
###601 that differ from one another, there will be conflict.
###604 How do we go about selecting a value system that makes sense?
###609 And how do we go about presenting a value system
###613 to people who know nothing about such a value system?
###617 I think the best way to do it
###620 is demonstration with films.
###623 In films, we can show how a person feels a volcano is angry.
###629 We have to show those movies
###631 and the sincerity of the witchdoctor talking about the solution.
###636 And we have to show the sincerity of Romans
###639 feeding Christians to lions.
###641 And we have to point out a group of people stoning a woman.
###647 And when Jesus comes in, he says:
###649 "He who is without sin, let him cast the first stone."
###653 All of us are erroneous in our values
###657 due to the early part of our historical upbringing.
###661 We are given a set of values that do not work.
###665 Proof: We have war, recession,
###668 hunger, poverty, starvation, illness.
###672 And if our society were oriented
###675 toward the well-being of our fellow human beings,
###679 I cannot see these problems as being dominant,
###684 in a society where every man works for himself,
###688 individual incentive, working for one's self.
###693 If people worked for one's self',
###695 there wouldn't be the electric light.
###698 There wouldn't be engines and powered vehicles.
###702 There wouldn't be electrification,
###704 and reservoirs and water purification.
###707 These are processes that help all people.
###710 And processes that help single people
###713 is a very primitive value system carried into this century
###718 which is really not necessary.
###720 However, it appears that humans
###724 do not seem to change or improve their value system
###728 until there is utter failure of that value system.
###732 People trained as a scientist tend to pause
###735 a little bit, before they accept an idea,
###739 a little more than the average person.
###743 They try to evaluate and they figured: "Well, a man is using
###746 the scientific method. He probably draws the correct conclusions."
###751 You know when you have faith in somebody, believe in somebody.
###755 A scientist doesn't believe in anything,
###758 neither accepts, rejects or holds in abeyance;
###762 that is, does not make a judgment
###765 until verifiable evidence is produced.
###772 So killing people is not the solution to any problem
###776 at all. War is the maximum expression of ignorance.
###786 'Good' and 'bad' is part of a value system.
###789 It has nothing to do with something coming
###792 from the inside of a human being.
###795 It appears that all evidence shows that intuition does not,
###801 and is not based upon innermost feelings.
###805 It's not based upon evidence. It's based upon
###810 being exposed to erroneous value systems.
###814 And where do you start most values?
###817 Most human values are erroneous,
###821 except when it comes to mathematics, physics, chemistry.
###825 They are more appropriate.
###827 So I would say if you become familiar with particular books,
###832 literature that we have on our website, it may help you.
