GELAREH KIAZAND: When you think
of gambling, you think


13
0:0:53,17 --> 0:0:55,31
of Las Vegas and tacky
slot machines.


14
0:0:55,31 --> 0:0:57,86
And when you think of
Afghanistan, you think of its


15
0:0:57,86 --> 0:0:59,97
reputation for corruption,
its never-ending


16
0:0:59,97 --> 0:1:2,5
wars, and the Taliban.


17
0:1:2,5 --> 0:1:5,54
But in spite of all this, the
men of Kabul have found refuge


18
0:1:5,54 --> 0:1:7,5
in a world of quail fighting
parlors and dusty


19
0:1:7,5 --> 0:1:9,11
dog fighting circles.


20
0:1:9,11 --> 0:1:11,28
We're going to explore this
culture of illicit gambling


21
0:1:11,28 --> 0:1:14,48
and see how the men of Kabul
thrive in a realm of sport


22
0:1:14,48 --> 0:1:16,95
that defies Islam.


23
0:1:16,95 --> 0:1:18,86
We're going to Marshal
Fahim's gardens.


24
0:1:18,86 --> 0:1:19,72
This is really exciting.


25
0:1:19,72 --> 0:1:22,36
We just got a phone call saying
that there might be a


26
0:1:22,36 --> 0:1:24,82
buzkashi game on today.


27
0:1:24,82 --> 0:1:28,72
So we're on our way there now,
and hopefully we can see the


28
0:1:28,72 --> 0:1:32,62
game and maybe talk to
his spokesperson.


29
0:1:32,62 --> 0:1:35,18
Buzkashi is the national
sport of Afghanistan.


30
0:1:35,18 --> 0:1:37,73
It's a lot like polo, but
instead of a ball, they play


31
0:1:37,73 --> 0:1:39,51
with a headless goat carcass.


32
0:1:39,51 --> 0:1:41,69
The sport is legal, but all
the side betting that the


33
0:1:41,69 --> 0:1:43,85
crowds take part in is not.


34
0:1:43,85 --> 0:1:46,86
And since Afghanistan's vice
president, Marshal Mohammed


35
0:1:46,86 --> 0:1:49,75
Fahim, was hosting the game at
his estate, it was a bit


36
0:1:49,75 --> 0:1:50,803

we got in, and then we got


43
0:2:5,9 --> 0:2:6,8
sent out again.


44
0:2:6,8 --> 0:2:9,395
Because today, Mr.
Fahim decided to


45
0:2:9,395 --> 0:2:10,19
show up to the game.


46
0:2:10,19 --> 0:2:13,53
And with Fahim, they're not
going to be allowing just


47
0:2:13,53 --> 0:2:15,6
anyone-- especially
a foreigner, a


48
0:2:15,6 --> 0:2:18,47
woman, with a camera.


49
0:2:18,47 --> 0:2:20,41
Kabul is the center of
this gambling world.


50
0:2:20,41 --> 0:2:23,73
But since betting is illegal,
reputation is very important.


51
0:2:23,73 --> 0:2:25,74
It was unlikely that they were
going to allow an Iranian


52
0:2:25,74 --> 0:2:27,62
woman into the bettor's circle,


53
0:2:27,62 --> 0:2:29,22

We're to meet Mr.
Samad Dardar.

He's an 80-year-old man who,
back in the days, they called


59
0:2:40,75 --> 0:2:42,98
him The Gangster, because
of all the fights


60
0:2:42,98 --> 0:2:43,72
he used to get into.


61
0:2:43,72 --> 0:2:47,29

8:00 AM, there will be

We're at Saleh Dezama's cafe.

0:4:28,56 --> 0:4:31,22
It's away from all the
craze of the city.


86
0:4:31,22 --> 0:4:32,91
They're very strict on the
people they let in.


87
0:4:32,91 --> 0:4:34,37
They don't just let anyone in.


88
0:4:34,37 --> 0:4:36,59
During the Talib times,
obviously this place was


89
0:4:36,59 --> 0:4:38,755
closed down, and no one
would come here.

-[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]


91
0:4:40,24 --> 0:4:45,69



92
0:4:45,69 --> 0:4:48,4
GELAREH KIAZAND: The Taliban
banned the sport, largely


93
0:4:48,4 --> 0:4:50,53
because the fights were
community-driven and brought a


94
0:4:50,53 --> 0:4:53,56
wide spectrum of influential men
together that could form


95
0:4:53,56 --> 0:4:57,13
alliances dangerous
to the regime.


96
0:4:57,13 --> 0:4:59,83
So head of the circle is sitting
there with the white


97
0:4:59,83 --> 0:5:0,88
bag in front of him.


98
0:5:0,88 --> 0:5:4,12
I'm trying to get people to put
more birds out or fight a


99
0:5:4,12 --> 0:5:5,483
bit, because they're
a bit reluctant in


100
0:5:5,483 --> 0:5:6,54
front of the camera.


101
0:5:6,54 --> 0:5:9,24
Everyone here pretty much
has a bird with them.


102
0:5:9,24 --> 0:5:10,83
They usually fight for
a couple hours.


103
0:5:10,83 --> 0:5:14,432
They sell them behind here in
case you don't have one.

[MUSIC PLAYING]


105
0:5:17,92 --> 0:5:19,71
GELAREH KIAZAND: So what they're
doing right now is,


106
0:5:19,71 --> 0:5:23,28
they go around and they start
comparing the different quails


107
0:5:23,28 --> 0:5:24,3
to each other.


108
0:5:24,3 --> 0:5:25,7
So what they have to
do is, they have to


109
0:5:25,7 --> 0:5:27,6
get the same weight.


110
0:5:27,6 --> 0:5:32,17
And then, once they pick, then
they come out in the middle.


111
0:5:32,17 --> 0:5:33,57
So how does a bird win?


112
0:5:33,57 --> 0:5:36,26
One quail has to push the other
out of the ring, or in


113
0:5:36,26 --> 0:5:38,53
this case, close to the
edge of the carpet.


114
0:5:38,53 --> 0:5:41,5
When a quail is pushed out of
the ring, or simply flees,


115
0:5:41,5 --> 0:5:42,263
it's game over.

118

betting slowed down.

were in power.

gambling on camera.
