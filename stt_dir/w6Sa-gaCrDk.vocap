###15 ZIYAH GAFIC: I don't think photography's a [INAUDIBLE]
###17 medium.
###18 I see it more as a series of impressions or constructs
###23 about my personal projects.
###25 I want to see them as open structure and to allow some
###28 liberty to readers to draw their own
###31 conclusions about it.
###32 
###69 I think that Islamic countries or Muslim world.
###71 There's a huge number of stories that are either
###75 untold, or told in a superficial way.
###78 Coming from a Muslim background in a country that
###81 has a significant Muslim community, I just wanted to
###84 try to offer a different perspective.
###87 
###91 Photography for me was a hobby.
###94 I have no academic background in photography whatsoever.
###99 I was studying comparative literature,
###101 that's my formal education.
###104 I want to tell stories.
###106 Here you're using words, the other place you're using
###109 pictures, but it's basically the same thing.
###111 
###114 During the war years in Bosnia, I was a
###117 teenager, I was 15.
###118 And I wasn't really able to take part in what was
###121 happening there, in the events that were unfolding around me.
###124 Because I was too young to fight, and I was too young to
###127 be a photographer.
###129 Except of being subject of those events, which means
###133 basically a target, like every other citizen.
###136 That was kind of a frustration.
###137 
###141 When I started working seriously, I was focused on
###145 what was an aftermath of the war in Bosnia.
###147 Huge part of it is compensation, maybe even
###151 re-creation of the excitement and adrenalin rushes that I
###155 was experiencing as a kid.
###156 
###159 And as I was completing that body of work, I realized that
###164 there was a number of places around the world that had been
###167 following a similar pattern of ethnic
###170 violence, fraternal wars.
###174 A lot of these places share one more thing in common,
###176 which is significant Muslim population.
###180 So I got interested in that, because I think photography--
###184 for me, it's all about empathy.
###186 My previous experience actually allows me to do that.
###191 And that's how the project, Troubled Islam, developed from
###194 working in Bosnia to all the countries
###196 all the way to Pakistan.
###198 This is from Pakistan.
###201 The family with the things that they saved when they were
###203 fleeing the Western Province.
###204 
###212 That is one of my favorites.
###214 It's Kabul Cemetery.
###215 
###217 It's oxymoron in itself.
###221 I just wanted to make a comparison
###223 between these countries.
###224 And one of the comparisons was, obviously, just to see
###228 how people cope.
###230 And how they manage to preserve the traces of
###233 normality despite all the odds that are against them.
###239 Comparative method is not necessarily a very fruitful
###241 method to make conclusions.
###244 I think with images it's very fruitful.
###246 I mean, if you put things together, the reader can kind
###249 of make a decision and make conclusions on their own.
###254 And this is the brand new book that hasn't been distributed
###257 yet and it's a very special project.
###263 So I wanted to make something where my interference as a
###266 photographer, as a human being, will be minimized.
###269 And I also wanted to make a project that my subjects might
###274 benefit from.
###276 And the project culminated in a publication
###279 called Quest for Identity.
###281 About eight years ago, I was working on a group project.
###284 And as part of that story, I went to this facility in
###287 central Bosnia which handles the whole identification
###292 process of missing people in Bosnia, which is roughly
###294 40,000 people have been missing or killed.
###297 They have database of DNA and so on and so forth.
###300 But among other things they also have storage of archived,
###304 cataloged items.
###307 Personal belongings that had been recovered along with the
###312 human remains.
###313 What happens, they invite families and they browse
###316 through these items.
###317 This is a horrible process.
###319 And I said, wait a minute, wouldn't it be better if these
###322 people actually recognized these items on the paper
###325 instead of actually physically having to go to these
###328 facilities and browse?
###331 So that's the project.
###332 So I just had to photograph these items in
###334 exactly the same way.
###335 On a forensics table on which the bodies are assembled, and
###338 photographic them in a very clinical, very detached way.
###341 And to create this book and iPad app and online catalog of
###347 these items which will correspond with
###349 the physical archive.
###350 
###352 It's amazing how absolute detachment in form can
###356 actually create an extremely emotional body of work.
###359 Everyone has a wristwatch, everyone has family pictures
###363 in their wallet.
###364 It allows you as a reader to create a story around.
###369 Twenty magazines published that across the globe, from
###372 Spain, to Holland, to the States.
###375 And the project was supported by so many people and so many
###379 organizations.
###380 So I think that's probably the best thing--
###382 well, not best, but the most important
###384 thing I've ever done.
###385 
###390 I have an assignment from the Sunday Times Magazine, which
###396 regularly hires me or runs my work.
###401 And so they gave me a commission for
###402 this particular story.
###405 We're flying to Riyadh in a few hours where we'll spend 10
###408 days to shoot a story on Saudi Arabian women.
###413 So I'm going to do photos, and I'm going to shoot video
###416 interviews.
###417 
###420 I traveled on several occasions to Saudi Arabia to
###422 do different stories.
###423 It's a place that it's actually rarely reported from,
###426 considering that it's pretty difficult to get access to the
###428 country itself.
###430 And every time someone speaks about Saudi Arabia, that's
###433 what they speak about-- women's rights
###435 to drive, to work.
###437 So it's a good place to challenge the stereotype.
###440 
###453 So we came to Saudi Arabia in Riyadh, the capital.
###457 Riyadh is a weird city, I would say.
###460 It's kind of heartland of the royal family, which is kind of
###463 plateau in the middle of the country.
###466 I wouldn't call it a beautiful city, because there's nothing
###469 actually to resemble the fact that this is one of the oldest
###473 inhabited places on Earth.
###475 Basically all the traces of old cultures and civilizations
###478 are kind of wiped out.
###480 And instead of that you just have this eclectic
###483 architecture which combines super modern American
###486 architecture with some Bedouin kind of tent-style roofs and
###490 so on and so forth.
###491 So a lot of glass, a lot of metal.
###493 
###501 Yeah, it is a kind of a place where everything takes place
###503 in the private places.
###505 Either behind the walls of the houses, or in
###508 the shopping malls--
###509 close quarters, so to speak.
###511 It's because of the heat, and because of this obsessive need
###515 for privacy.
###517 So nothing really happens in the streets.
###520 And to make things even more complicated, Saudi society's
###523 fairly segregated.
###524 I wouldn't call it extreme, but here it's more visible.
###529 Talking to women in general, it's not the
###531 easiest thing to do.
###533 And especially when it comes to talking to camera or taking
###536 pictures that are going to be published abroad.
###539 
###542 It's a traditional culture, it's sensitive.
###545 So as usual, I rely on local knowledge and local
###549 connections.
###549 Good, yeah?
###550 FAHMI FARAHAT: Absolutely, ready.
###552 Rock and roll.
###553 ZIYAH GAFIC: Because no matter how many times to travel to a
###556 certain place, your knowledge of culture and how things work
###559 is fairly limited.
###562 We hired a local production company.
###565 They have a lot of experience in dealing with people.
###568 I made specific demands of what kind of women I would
###571 like to meet.
###572 The local production company basically sorted it all out.
###575 FAHMI FARAHAT: Ladies.
###578 It's what I do for a living now, fixing ladies.
###580 
###587 ZIYAH GAFIC: I think there's a general feeling that Muslim
###590 women in general, and Saudi woman in particular, is
###594 somehow put in the backseat of the society.
###597 That picture is very fragmented and largely
###600 inaccurate.
###601 So I'd like to get kind of a cross section of Saudi women
###605 and to try to photograph them and interview them in their
###610 private spaces or their working space.
###614 That way?
###615 MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.
###616 
###618 DR. BOTHYNA MURSHID: In Saudi Arabia when we go
###620 out, we wear abaya.
###622 Abaya, it's different from region to region.
###626 Here in Riyadh, we wear mainly black.
###631 For every occasion, we do have different kind of abaya.
###635 Fashion designer, they would have a business
###638 only to sell abaya.
###640 And women they, of course, are like oh, I'm wearing this
###642 designer, I'm wearing that.
###645 So yes, abaya, it's part of the fashion now.
###649 My name is Bothyna Zakarea Murshid.
###652 I had my doctorate from Yale University in management of
###655 chronic illness, which is sub-speciality from doctorate
###661 in clinical research.
###663 ZIYAH GAFIC: Whenever we are talking about Muslim woman,
###666 Saudi Arabia's always picked up as a bad example.
###668 But actually, statistically, women in Saudi Arabia are more
###671 educated than men.
###672 There are more women with college degrees, or MAs and
###676 BAs and PhDs, than men.
###679 If the issue that we are dealing with is that Muslim
###682 woman are underrepresented in the media, then I want to
###685 dedicate my attention to her.
###689 Can you move a little bit that way?
###690 Yeah, perfect.
###692 That's why portraits seemed like an
###693 appropriate way to do it.
###696 I wanted to give certain formal values to the picture.
###700 So I'd like to be accurately composed.
###703 
###712 After all these years of being a photographer, I don't get
###715 easily surprised.
###716 But what keeps surprising me every single time I get out in
###720 the field and photograph is how people are willing to
###723 allow photographers to enter their private space.
###725 I think that's pretty amazing in any country.
###728 And also in a country like Saudi Arabia where everything
###731 is so private anyways.
###733 Somehow there's this implied trust between a subject and a
###736 photographer.
###738 So you have a cupcake store?
###740 BASSMA ALHAMMAD: It's not ours, we're
###742 only opening the franchise.
###744 But the original was in Dammam.
###746 It was founded by a Saudi female--
###750 it was very successful.
###752 It's all cupcakes, and they covered over
###755 with the green cream.
###758 About the Saudi women in general, a lot of people think
###761 they're pampered.
###762 But the truth is no, they're very active
###767 but behind the scenes.
###769 They're mothers, they're housewives, they work, they
###772 study at the same time.
###773 A full job, also they're starting their own business.
###777 Recently I can see they're achieving a lot.
###779 
###782 ZIYAH GAFIC: On the other hand, yeah,
###783 they're beautiful women.
###785 That's also another thing that we are not aware of.
###787 Because most of the images you see are the images from the
###790 street where they are obliged to cover either part of their
###793 body or most of their body and face.
###795 
###801 This was a more controlled environment where I would
###807 choose which part of the room or house plays the person the
###811 way I would like.
###813 What I wanted to create is this kind of simple
###815 environmental portraits.
###817 And the context, in this case environment and private
###821 spaces, actually tell much more than just the figure or
###825 the face of the person.
###826 
###835 The story about Islam is a relevant one, globally.
###839 I think it's been widely inaccurately
###842 represented in the media.
###843 That it's tried to be presented as a conflict
###845 between East and West and between Christianity and
###848 Islam, and I think that's really dangerous.
###851 So it's on us to shift that image.
###855 [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###856 
###874 ZIYAH GAFIC: Oh, wow.
###876 Jesus.
###877 [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###878 
###919 ZIYAH GAFIC: All of the women we met, they all work and they
###923 all have college degrees.
###925 And equally so, I'm sure there's a bunch of women who
###930 are not educated and are out of work.
###933 But I'm just talking about what I've seen.
###935 And obviously, we've seen only a small fraction of it, so I'm
###938 not claiming that we have the whole picture.
###941 But I think it's important to do stories that are showing at
###944 least slightly a different side of the coin.
###949 Nice to meet you.
###949 How are you?
###950 Nice to meet you.
###951 With photographers somehow, a lot of us try to please the
###956 stereotypes.
###957 We put the blame on yeah, that's what the media wants.
###960 That's what the people want to see.
###963 How do we know what people want to see?
###965 I can only listen to the common sense.
###969 If I was the reader, what I would like to read?
###971 So this is what I would like to read.
###973 So I do the stories that I would like to see
###976 someone else do.
###977
