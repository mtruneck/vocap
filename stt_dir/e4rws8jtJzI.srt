0:0:12,42 --> 0:0:15,42
ELANA ADLER: Hi, I'm
Elana Adler, and


3
0:0:15,42 --> 0:0:18,574
we're Hedgeboken Hedgehogs.


4
0:0:18,574 --> 0:0:20,0
-That's awesome.


5
0:0:20,0 --> 0:0:21,67
ELANA ADLER: The bane of
my mother's existence.


6
0:0:21,67 --> 0:0:25,124
-It's so weird because they're
so cute, I want to pet them.


7
0:0:25,124 --> 0:0:26,52
But then--


8
0:0:26,52 --> 0:0:28,93
ELANA ADLER: They're fine with
being petted once you're


9
0:0:28,93 --> 0:0:29,48
holding them.


10
0:0:29,48 --> 0:0:31,365
But when the hand just comes
at them, they freak.


11
0:0:31,365 --> 0:0:33,11
Because they don't know
what's going on.


12
0:0:33,11 --> 0:0:34,7
They're very independent.


13
0:0:34,7 --> 0:0:36,69
They'll take you or leave you.


14
0:0:36,69 --> 0:0:38,82
If you want to interact
with them, great.


15
0:0:38,82 --> 0:0:39,98
They do enjoy the company.


16
0:0:39,98 --> 0:0:44,584
But they're also just fine
about being on their own.


17
0:0:44,584 --> 0:0:45,999
That's definitely cute.


18
0:0:45,999 --> 0:0:48,753



19
0:0:48,753 --> 0:0:50,3
-There they are.


20
0:0:50,3 --> 0:0:54,0



21
0:0:54,0 --> 0:0:57,285
What's with the tubing, the fact
that they always like to


22
0:0:57,285 --> 0:0:58,6
go into tubes?


23
0:0:58,6 --> 0:1:0,86
ELANA ADLER: It's because they
like to burrow and dig.


24
0:1:0,86 --> 0:1:2,6
So they're digging.


25
0:1:2,6 --> 0:1:4,69
There are two of
them in a tube.


26
0:1:4,69 --> 0:1:7,2
-Got a double tube action.


27
0:1:7,2 --> 0:1:9,81
ELANA ADLER: It's a
push me, pull you.


28
0:1:9,81 --> 0:1:15,86
-So do you know why hedgehogs
are illegal in certain states?


29
0:1:15,86 --> 0:1:17,73
ELANA ADLER: I know California
they're illegal.


30
0:1:17,73 --> 0:1:21,87
But I think that has a lot to do
with them cracking down on


31
0:1:21,87 --> 0:1:25,59
any animals that could be
introduced and potentially


32
0:1:25,59 --> 0:1:27,0
become feral there.


33
0:1:27,0 --> 0:1:28,72
Is this is Isabella.


34
0:1:28,72 --> 0:1:29,88
She's very friendly.


35
0:1:29,88 --> 0:1:33,53
She's what we call a chocolate
chip, because she has a lot of


36
0:1:33,53 --> 0:1:37,34
white quills with some brown
quills interspersed.


37
0:1:37,34 --> 0:1:38,88
So this is a Chock.


38
0:1:38,88 --> 0:1:41,2
I have two little snowballs
to show you.


39
0:1:41,2 --> 0:1:42,99
Some people don't like
the albinos.


40
0:1:42,99 --> 0:1:44,72
You either love them
or you hate them.


41
0:1:44,72 --> 0:1:46,21
I think they're very cute.


42
0:1:46,21 --> 0:1:47,48
Their quills are just
growing in.


43
0:1:47,48 --> 0:1:48,82
They had their first baby set.


44
0:1:48,82 --> 0:1:50,34
Now they're getting
a bigger set.


45
0:1:50,34 --> 0:1:52,75
And he's actually being very
good, because he's letting us


46
0:1:52,75 --> 0:1:53,325
see his nose.


47
0:1:53,325 --> 0:1:58,285



48
0:1:58,285 --> 0:2:0,81
See if they want to
run down the hall.


49
0:2:0,81 --> 0:2:2,6
-They're so wobbly.


50
0:2:2,6 --> 0:2:5,1



51
0:2:5,1 --> 0:2:6,46
ELANA ADLER: Look how nicely
that girl is cooperating.


52
0:2:6,46 --> 0:2:13,788



53
0:2:13,788 --> 0:2:14,92
This is Oren.


54
0:2:14,92 --> 0:2:18,7
He's one of my boys.


55
0:2:18,7 --> 0:2:19,1
I'm a big pudgemeister.
