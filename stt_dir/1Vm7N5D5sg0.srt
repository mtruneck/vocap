1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:8,9



2
0:0:8,9 --> 0:0:12,18
People have the right to know
that there are spy satellites


3
0:0:12,18 --> 0:0:16,3
above their heads, and not only
spy satellites, but all


4
0:0:16,3 --> 0:0:17,76
kinds of satellites.


5
0:0:17,76 --> 0:0:22,48
And by a clear night, they can
see all the satellites passing


6
0:0:22,48 --> 0:0:23,22
over their heads.


7
0:0:23,22 --> 0:0:27,66
So in a sense, they
are not so secret.


8
0:0:27,66 --> 0:0:31,12
Yes, I think that it may
interest some people to know


9
0:0:31,12 --> 0:0:34,6
that these satellites are
visible, and even that we can


10
0:0:34,6 --> 0:0:37,73
catch some details with
a telescope--


11
0:0:37,73 --> 0:0:40,83
like a game, spying
spy satellites.


12
0:0:40,83 --> 0:0:59,32



13
0:0:59,32 --> 0:1:5,28
We are in the Astronomy and
Space encounter, the main


14
0:1:5,28 --> 0:1:9,85
forum or encounter place for
astronomy in France.


15
0:1:9,85 --> 0:1:13,33
It happens every two years, and
there are several thousand


16
0:1:13,33 --> 0:1:15,49
visitors during three days.


17
0:1:15,49 --> 0:1:19,51
My speech is about, of course,
photography of space station


18
0:1:19,51 --> 0:1:22,88
and other satellites, like
geostationary satellites or


19
0:1:22,88 --> 0:1:24,515
other funny satellites.


20
0:1:24,515 --> 0:1:32,5



21
0:1:32,5 --> 0:1:33,65
My name is Thierry Legault.


22
0:1:33,65 --> 0:1:35,7
I'm an engineer.


23
0:1:35,7 --> 0:1:37,31
I live in the suburbs
of Paris.


24
0:1:37,31 --> 0:1:40,74
My hobby is astronomy,
and more precisely


25
0:1:40,74 --> 0:1:41,99
astrophotography.


26
0:1:41,99 --> 0:1:46,36



27
0:1:46,36 --> 0:1:52,42
It's a nice feeling to be able
to transmit our passion to


28
0:1:52,42 --> 0:1:56,5
other people and help them
through to practice and to do


29
0:1:56,5 --> 0:2:1,776
the same kind of photography as
I do-- or better, I hope.


30
0:2:1,776 --> 0:2:5,84
And I would like to try to
find all the ways to be


31
0:2:5,84 --> 0:2:8,81
different because I like
to do things that


32
0:2:8,81 --> 0:2:10,479
have never been done.


33
0:2:10,479 --> 0:2:23,2



34
0:2:23,2 --> 0:2:26,46
This website called Heavens
Above gives us the list of the


35
0:2:26,46 --> 0:2:30,89
brightest satellites visible
in the evening tonight.


36
0:2:30,89 --> 0:2:35,22
And a good candidate
is the Cosmos 1782


37
0:2:35,22 --> 0:2:36,8
because it's quite bright.


38
0:2:36,8 --> 0:2:39,5
It's an intelligence
satellites--


39
0:2:39,5 --> 0:2:40,28
Russian intelligence
satellite.


40
0:2:40,28 --> 0:2:46,14
So I go into the other website,
which is CalSky, to


41
0:2:46,14 --> 0:2:50,21
get some calculations.


42
0:2:50,21 --> 0:2:54,5
When I was a teenager,
I asked my parents


43
0:2:54,5 --> 0:2:56,905
to buy a small telescope.


44
0:2:56,905 --> 0:3:0,24
And then I was the happiest
child in the world with my


45
0:3:0,24 --> 0:3:3,92
telescope, looking at
the stars, the moon.


46
0:3:3,92 --> 0:3:9,325
And then I continue with a lot
bigger means now, and bigger


47
0:3:9,325 --> 0:3:13,26
telescopes and cameras, but
in the same principle.


48
0:3:13,26 --> 0:3:18,78
The satellite will come from
there, like this, over the


49
0:3:18,78 --> 0:3:20,3
house like that.


50
0:3:20,3 --> 0:3:31,4



51
0:3:31,4 --> 0:3:36,3
I got started watching
satellites quite by chance.


52
0:3:36,3 --> 0:3:39,32
Six years ago, I've been
writing a book about


53
0:3:39,32 --> 0:3:40,95
astrophotography.


54
0:3:40,95 --> 0:3:44,57
And since I wanted to take all
of the photos for the book, I


55
0:3:44,57 --> 0:3:49,74
needed any kind of a photo of
the sky including the passage


56
0:3:49,74 --> 0:3:52,2
of the space station in
front of the sun.


57
0:3:52,2 --> 0:3:54,5
So I took one.


58
0:3:54,5 --> 0:3:59,34
And I said, OK, this is funny,
so took a picture of the space


59
0:3:59,34 --> 0:4:1,45
station and the space
shuttle just


60
0:4:1,45 --> 0:4:5,83
beside, just after undocking.


61
0:4:5,83 --> 0:4:12,758
And this photo has had big
success on CNN, and the


62
0:4:12,758 --> 0:4:16,19
"Guardian," and "Popular
Science," and a lot of


63
0:4:16,19 --> 0:4:19,48
magazines in France
and also in other


64
0:4:19,48 --> 0:4:21,7
countries in the world.


65
0:4:21,7 --> 0:4:23,312
And so I continued to
take such shots.


66
0:4:23,312 --> 0:4:27,74



67
0:4:27,74 --> 0:4:29,708
OK, good.


68
0:4:29,708 --> 0:4:43,12



69
0:4:43,12 --> 0:4:47,7
More than three years ago,
I contacted a friend of a


70
0:4:47,7 --> 0:4:51,78
friend, which is named Emmanuel
Rietsch, to modify my


71
0:4:51,78 --> 0:4:55,78
mount to be able to track,
automatically, the satellites.


72
0:4:55,78 --> 0:4:58,42
Basically, there were two
parts in the project.


73
0:4:58,42 --> 0:5:3,12
The first part was to make the
mount able to track the


74
0:5:3,12 --> 0:5:8,7
satellite manually, with a
joystick, like a joystick of a


75
0:5:8,7 --> 0:5:9,415
video game.


76
0:5:9,415 --> 0:5:13,35
And so the second part of the
project has been to make the


77
0:5:13,35 --> 0:5:16,9
system, and especially the
software, with an additional


78
0:5:16,9 --> 0:5:20,57
camera, tracking camera, able
to track to satellites


79
0:5:20,57 --> 0:5:21,83
automatically.


80
0:5:21,83 --> 0:5:23,49
This is a Unix system.


81
0:5:23,49 --> 0:5:26,13



82
0:5:26,13 --> 0:5:27,53
In a matter of-- thank
you, Emmanuel.


83
0:5:27,53 --> 0:5:49,68



84
0:5:49,68 --> 0:5:56,91
This telescope will take
the high resolution


85
0:5:56,91 --> 0:5:59,5
video of the satellite.


86
0:5:59,5 --> 0:6:2,82
This one is used just to
track the satellite


87
0:6:2,82 --> 0:6:4,83
with a second camera.


88
0:6:4,83 --> 0:6:8,5
There would be the main camera
here, second camera here.


89
0:6:8,5 --> 0:6:13,43
And this one is to center the
satellite visually, just at


90
0:6:13,43 --> 0:6:16,89
the beginning, when it appears,
to be sure that it's


91
0:6:16,89 --> 0:6:20,4
visible through this camera.


92
0:6:20,4 --> 0:6:24,9
With the solar or lunar transit,
almost all of them


93
0:6:24,9 --> 0:6:26,1
are successful--


94
0:6:26,1 --> 0:6:28,3
95% or more.


95
0:6:28,3 --> 0:6:30,36
But for satellites like
that, it's much less.


96
0:6:30,36 --> 0:6:33,66
It's, say, 50%.


97
0:6:33,66 --> 0:6:35,7
Sometimes there are
some clouds.


98
0:6:35,7 --> 0:6:37,36
Sometimes they are too faint.


99
0:6:37,36 --> 0:6:41,82
Sometimes computers don't want
to work exactly as you want.


100
0:6:41,82 --> 0:6:44,24
Especially, just at the critical
moment, you have a


101
0:6:44,24 --> 0:6:47,135
blue screen saying, everything
is crashed.


102
0:6:47,135 --> 0:6:48,385
It happens sometimes.


103
0:6:48,385 --> 0:6:51,76



104
0:6:51,76 --> 0:6:54,91
Astrophotography is not
something that's very easy.


105
0:6:54,91 --> 0:6:59,91
The stars, and the nebulas, and
the galaxies are faint.


106
0:6:59,91 --> 0:7:4,38
The planets are small, and
so it's quite difficult.


107
0:7:4,38 --> 0:7:7,2
Light pollution is a very,
very big problem for


108
0:7:7,2 --> 0:7:11,762
astronomers because they have to
go farther and farther from


109
0:7:11,762 --> 0:7:13,24
the cities.


110
0:7:13,24 --> 0:7:18,52
And it's just like people are
prisoners in a prison of light


111
0:7:18,52 --> 0:7:21,76
because they can't see outside
this prison of light.


112
0:7:21,76 --> 0:7:25,82
They don't see the nature, and
the stars, and the Milky Way.


113
0:7:25,82 --> 0:7:28,47
So in my opinion,
light pollution,


114
0:7:28,47 --> 0:7:30,455
is a kind of prison.


115
0:7:30,455 --> 0:7:35,24
So I have to align everything
first on a star, the polar


116
0:7:35,24 --> 0:7:39,31
star, which will appear later.


117
0:7:39,31 --> 0:7:44,96
And then, after all this
alignment, I have to focus the


118
0:7:44,96 --> 0:7:46,93
camera on the star.


119
0:7:46,93 --> 0:7:50,2
And then I have to change the
alignment in the mount to


120
0:7:50,2 --> 0:7:54,268
align it on the trajectory of
the satellite in the sky.


121
0:7:54,268 --> 0:8:4,31



122
0:8:4,31 --> 0:8:5,56
So far.


123
0:8:5,56 --> 0:8:7,89



124
0:8:7,89 --> 0:8:12,16
The weather is the biggest
enemy of the astronomer


125
0:8:12,16 --> 0:8:16,29
because the telescope that
looks through the clouds


126
0:8:16,29 --> 0:8:17,58
doesn't exist.


127
0:8:17,58 --> 0:8:22,76
Unfortunately we see
some clouds coming


128
0:8:22,76 --> 0:8:25,26
over the area of Paris.


129
0:8:25,26 --> 0:8:29,45
Paris is the red dot in the
north of France here.


130
0:8:29,45 --> 0:8:33,38
And so we'll have a sky which
that is partly cloudy so we


131
0:8:33,38 --> 0:8:35,88
need some chance.


132
0:8:35,88 --> 0:8:42,12
It's not the funniest part of
the game, driving and trying


133
0:8:42,12 --> 0:8:43,72
to find clear skies.


134
0:8:43,72 --> 0:8:47,0
But when it's successful, it's
more rewarding, let's say.


135
0:8:47,0 --> 0:8:53,34



136
0:8:53,34 --> 0:8:56,401
All the clouds are coming now.


137
0:8:56,401 --> 0:8:58,79
The sky is completely covered.


138
0:8:58,79 --> 0:9:3,55
And this is one of the reasons
why we go in sunny countries


139
0:9:3,55 --> 0:9:4,39
to observe the sky.


140
0:9:4,39 --> 0:9:14,21



141
0:9:14,21 --> 0:9:19,526
OK, we have quite a hole, but
other ones coming after.


142
0:9:19,526 --> 0:9:26,128



143
0:9:26,128 --> 0:9:28,104
These clouds coming again.


144
0:9:28,104 --> 0:9:36,996



145
0:9:36,996 --> 0:9:38,478
I think it's over.


146
0:9:38,478 --> 0:9:53,792



147
0:9:53,792 --> 0:9:58,134
It's full of clouds now.


148
0:9:58,134 --> 0:10:0,102
This is a pity.


149
0:10:0,102 --> 0:10:4,7
They have clouds everywhere,
so nature has won.


150
0:10:4,7 --> 0:10:7,71
She's always the stronger,
at the end.


151
0:10:7,71 --> 0:10:11,16
I'm a little bit sad,
of course, but I


152
0:10:11,16 --> 0:10:12,67
know that it's a risk.


153
0:10:12,67 --> 0:10:17,16
So if I don't want to take the
risk, I'd just stay on my sofa


154
0:10:17,16 --> 0:10:18,0
watching TV.


155
0:10:18,0 --> 0:10:21,18
And so it's a part
of the risk.


156
0:10:21,18 --> 0:10:23,91
Of course, I'm not very happy.


157
0:10:23,91 --> 0:10:32,12
But an activity where there is
no in risk, and where you win


158
0:10:32,12 --> 0:10:34,62
every time, it's something
that is too easy.


159
0:10:34,62 --> 0:10:39,82



160
0:10:39,82 --> 0:10:42,85
I photograph satellites because
it's difficult.


161
0:10:42,85 --> 0:10:45,87
It's a kind of challenge
with myself.


162
0:10:45,87 --> 0:10:49,66
And each time I say, OK,
you succeed or not.


163
0:10:49,66 --> 0:10:51,97
And next time, can
you do better?


164
0:10:51,97 --> 0:10:53,97
Can do another satellite?


165
0:10:53,97 --> 0:10:55,16
Something else?


166
0:10:55,16 --> 0:10:56,86
Something more difficult?


167
0:10:56,86 --> 0:11:2,572
So it's a way to improve my
skill with a telescope.


168
0:11:2,572 --> 0:11:6,47
And yeah, it's like a game or
a challenge with myself.


169
0:11:6,47 --> 0:11:9,3
Next time, I will get them.


170
0:11:9,3 --> 0:13:9,3
