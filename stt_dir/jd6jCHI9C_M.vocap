###3 EMERSON ROSENTHAL: The most important thing to know about
###5 fresh water in California is that there just isn't enough.
###8 The second thing you quickly find out is that the state's
###11 no stranger to full-on water wars.
###14 Basically, whoever controls the water in California
###17 controls the future.
###19 Currently the dominant player in the state's big agriculture
###23 is Paramount Farms, which is owned and
###25 operated by Stewart Resnick.
###27 Stewart's goals have recently aligned very closely with
###30 Governor Jerry Brown's.
###32 WALT GRAY: California's water war is heating up.
###34 The governor has just unveiled a new $14 billion plan to
###37 build two tunnels underneath the delta, transferring water
###41 from northern California to southern California.
###44 The governor says his plan will create a reliable water
###47 supply and still maintain a healthy
###49 ecosystem in the delta.
###51 Not everyone agrees.
###53 EMERSON ROSENTHAL: That's why we came out west.
###55 We wanted a firsthand look into the newest chapter of
###57 California's water works.
###59 
###70 So, our first job was to meet Congressman John Garamendi,
###73 who has been fighting Jerry Brown's water
###75 proposals since the '70s.
###80 JOHN GARAMENDI: This proposal goes back at least 40 years.
###83 Jerry Brown, in the 1970s, when he was governor, wanted
###87 to build this system, got it through the legislature.
###91 I and several other folks decided that was a bad thing
###94 and we fought it.
###95 We had a referendum.
###96 And now he's back.
###99 He said it very clearly, I'm going to do it this time.
###103 What are you going to do, governor?
###105 You're so determined to relive your old life that you want to
###110 destroy this thing?
###111 You want to build a system that would destroy the largest
###114 estuary on the west coast of the Western hemisphere?
###116 Is that what this is all about, just so
###118 you say I did it?
###120 It's the north versus the south.
###122 It's the war of water in California.
###124 It's been going on since the gold rush, and it's continuing
###128 to this day.
###129 
###133 ADAM KEATS: This area right here is the point at which the
###135 water leaves the public realm and enters the private realm,
###138 so to speak.
###139 The equation is solely focused on big, Southern California
###144 agribusiness.
###145 Huge mega-corporations that are some of the largest farm
###148 interests in the world, producing big-money crops.
###150 And that's the primary thing driving this thing.
###153 And no one has a right to own the water.
###155 It doesn't mean you can totally deprive the rest of
###157 the state of its access to the water--
###160 and when I say rest of the state, that includes the fish
###162 and the birds and the animals.
###164 Early on, in the early 2000s, mid 2000s, we noticed huge
###168 declines of fish species in the delta.
###171 6 million splittail were killed in one count, and
###175 14,000, 15,000 salmon.
###178 Instead of having the power in one interest, the San Joaquin
###181 Valley farmers-- and that's primarily one company,
###185 Paramount Farms--
###186 instead of having one big boy controlling the whole game,
###189 have the state control it, and have the state control with
###192 very strict rules, in terms of who gets water, when they get
###195 water, why they get water.
###196 And include in that mix all the birds and fish in the
###199 environment and ecosystem up here.
###201 But you can answer all the questions just by figuring out
###203 where the money is, who's making the most
###205 money off the deal.
###207 EMERSON ROSENTHAL: Moving large amounts of water from
###209 one place to another isn't anything new.
###212 But the water from the San Joaquin delta is already
###214 spoken for.
###215 By law, farmers who have lived here in the San Joaquin Valley
###219 for over 250 years still maintain priority rights over
###224 the delta's water.
###225 They get it first, and their livelihoods depend on it.
###229 RUDY MUSSI: My father was a farmer.
###230 I farm with my brother, and I've done that
###233 for the last 50 years.
###235 All this proposal does is just steal the water from one area
###239 and ship it to another area.
###241 The reasoning changes all the time.
###245 At first, it was to enhance the aquatic species out here.
###249 Well, the Academy of Science said the peripheral tunnels or
###254 canal won't enhance the species.
###257 So then they said, well, we'll do adaptive management.
###261 So, in other words, we're going to build this and then
###263 we'll figure it out how to work it.
###265 We fought this battle in 1982, and I think my dad fought this
###269 battle in the '50s and the '60s.
###272 It's always been somebody trying to steal our water.
###274 Anytime there's a finite amount of water, there's
###279 always somebody that doesn't have it that wants it.
###284 And don't get me wrong.
###286 We don't mind sharing any surplus water, but
###289 don't take my water.
###290 I depend on it for my livelihood.
###292 
###294 EMERSON ROSENTHAL: Right now, we're heading into Clarksburg,
###296 where we're going to film where they want to begin these
###300 new tunnels.
###301 
###309 Sacramento River, chilling on a private levee.
###312 Snuck out here so we can see it for ourselves.
###315 If Jerry Brown's peripheral canal proposal goes through,
###318 they'll take two large tunnels underground, right under here,
###323 and 9,000 cubic inches of water per second will be taken
###328 from Sacramento River all the way down south.
###332 And basically, all the farmers out here are completely
###335 dependent on this water.
###337 Potentially, that could all end as quickly as
###341 shutting off a faucet.
###342 
###348 John Herrick is one of a number of lawyers working to
###351 stop the Bay Delta
###352 conservation plan from approval.
###354 Along with a number of colleagues, John's been on the
###356 job for about 30 years already.
###358 
###361 JOHN HERRICK: Their proposal is, we're going to improve the
###362 delta by moving our intake.
###365 So their plan is to make the delta better by having less
###368 fresh water flow through it.
###372 It's that nuts.
###374 EMERSON ROSENTHAL: Why does the Department of Water
###376 Resources and the Department of the Interior want them to
###381 have those water rights?
###383 JOHN HERRICK: That's an interesting question.
###384 I don't know.
###385 One of the things that should be separated, but isn't, is
###388 the fact that the Department of Water Resources is a seller
###393 to the contractors.
###394 So large amounts of money go from the people who want the
###398 water, exporters, to the department.
###401 That connection of buyer-seller has resulted in
###403 the Department of Water Resources following the
###407 desires of their clients, their buyers.
###411 In our opinion, although we haven't figured out a way,
###413 there are people that should be put in
###414 jail for these things.
###415 
###421 EMERSON ROSENTHAL: All right, so basically, all of the
###423 proponents of the peripheral canal have pointed us in the
###428 direction of the Department of Water Resources.
###431 But unfortunately, after we set up an appointment with
###434 them, they claimed that they heard some things about us and
###439 decided to cancel our 2 o'clock appointment.
###442 So it is 10 o'clock now.
###444 We figure we might jump in, because we have to hear from
###447 their side, and their reasons behind wanting
###450 this peripheral canal.
###451 
###459 Yeah, we're doing an interview.
###462 How's it going?
###463 -Oh, you know.
###465 I work for state parks.
###467 How good can it be?
###469 -This too shall pass.
###471 -It's entertaining.
###472 
###480 EMERSON ROSENTHAL: Uh, yeah we did.
###481 For 10 o'clock, originally.
###506 The secretary was sharp enough to divert us away from the
###510 building and not let us talk to anybody.
###512 But we got some good pizza
###513 recommendations, so we're cool.
###515 
###519 Once we got back to New York, we realized that after all of
###522 our appointments were canceled with the Department of Water
###525 Resources, the Natural Resources Agency, and the
###528 chemist who helped back the proposal's science, we didn't
###531 have a single statement from the proponents of the plan,
###534 let alone a positive one.
###536 So we tried again.
###538 OK, so I just found the list of all of the supporters.
###543 This is everybody who is a proponent of
###545 the peripheral canal.
###547 Let's see if we can talk to somebody.
###549 [PHONE RINGING]
###552 -Financial Resources Agency, this is Kim, how may
###554 I direct your call?
###556 Hi there.
###556 My name is Emerson Rosenthal, and I'm calling on behalf of
###559 Vice Media.
###559 OK.
###560 Can you hold for just one second?
###561 Let me see if there's somebody available.
###564 Hi, this is Nancy Vogel, director of public affairs for
###567 the department.
###567 Hi, you've reached [INAUDIBLE]
###569 with Paramount Farms, please leave a message and I will
###571 return your call.
###572 We had someone here in the office that covers Bay Delta.
###575 They're not in right now, you can leave a message--
###577 Were you the woman that sent us to that
###578 really great pizza place?
###580 Yes.
###580 That's me.
###582 OK.
###582 Oh good, you guys liked Zelda's, after all?
###584 Yeah, it was delicious.
###586 Just one second, let me see if there's somebody available.
###588 Will you please hold for just one second?
###590 One moment.
###590 Thank you.
###590 One moment.
###591 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###603 EMERSON ROSENTHAL: The only response we got was an email
###605 from the governor's press office, with a link to their
###608 press release.
###610 In the meantime, the governor's been hard at work
###612 pushing the proposal past a legislative vote, in spite of
###615 the opposition.
###616 JERRY BROWN: This proposal balances the concerns of those
###619 who live and work on the delta, those who rely on it
###622 for water, and those who appreciate its beauty, its
###625 fish, waterfowl and wildlife.
###628 EMERSON ROSENTHAL: So we'll have to go with that as their
###630 official statement.
###631 And with all lines of communication cut off between
###634 the designers of the plan and the people asking questions,
###636 the Bay Delta conservation plan is quickly becoming an
###639 imminent reality in the haze of California politics.
###642 Will governor Jerry Brown win the water war he's been waging
###645 since the '70s?
###646 Is this a new precedent for controlling water in America?
###650 In the words of Detective Walsh, in perhaps the most
###652 famous film about California's water, "Forget it, Jake.
###656 It's Chinatown."
