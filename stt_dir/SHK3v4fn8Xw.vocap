###3 (Host) I think people are more involved in scarcity-driven concerns.
###9 - Yes - You know, more than ever!
###12 And abundance is the way to eliminate that. - Well, right, right.
###16 - Not only an abundance in resources
###18 but also knowledge: how to use that abundance.
###23 If you just produce an abundance and distribute that to people
###27 you'll [have] mass hedonism: a total collapse of the society.
###32 You must educate people to live with that.
###35 In other words, you have to tell people
###37 even during instruction, [for example] learning to fly an airplane:
###41 what you can't do, what your landing speed has to be.
###44 If you don't have a certain speed you will not rise off the ground.
###48 If you don't maintain the speed in landing, your craft will fall to the ground.
###53 These are laws, physical laws, and we must become aware
###58 of the physical laws that affect human behavior, our values, our lifestyle.
###64 - (Jacque) ...rates, going up like that and the amount of people needed
###68 to turn out a given amount of products.
###70 It's always less people and higher products, do you follow me?
###75 [J. Rifkin] said: "When production hits this,
###80 and the amount of people required hits that,
###83 when they cross, that's the end of the system."
###85 Has nothing to do with good men, bad men
###87 politics, corruption, fascism, free enterprise.
###91 All of these discussions about communism, socialism,
###94 free enterprise, fascism, become irrelevant in a society of an abundance
###100 where people have access to things. All those things fade out:
###103 labor unions, you just don't need that anymore.
###106 It just does not exist.
###109 - (Host) [In a] truly free society we would not have things like protectionism
###114 and nationalism and things like that. - (Jacque) OK.
###117 If abundance existed all over the world,
###120 all the water you want, all the food, growing all over the place,
###124 no one would stake out territories.
###126 You stake out territories because it promotes survival.
###129 People living on a desert can only have a tribe of a certain size
###132 because that desert region can't support more than 50 people.
###137 You have wandering nomads that wander with the animal migration,
###142 so if there's scarcity and new people come into that area,
###146 they say "You're moving in on my territory!"
###149 You know a lot of vegetarians actually believe
###152 that vegetarianism produces more amiable patterns of behavior.
###158 Actually, that's not true.
###160 Cows in the field have all the grass they want
###163 so they're not very aggressive. Any place you walk there's grass to chew on.
###167 They're not aggressive because there's an abundance;
###169 whereas herbivorous animals, carnivores,
###172 don't have as much abundance.
###174 They have to run after animals and hunt them down,
###177 and sometimes you don't make it. You're not always in great physical shape,
###181 so they have to be more aggressive.
###184 They have to be more aggressive to survive.
###186 It's the scarcity of food that generates that.
###190 Hunger generates the hunt for food, for animals.
###194 If you didn't had pains of hunger, it wouldn't be that [way].
###199 Years ago, primitive societies
###202 used soldiers to keep people in line, or police.
###206 Some inventor came up to the old landowner and he said:
###210 "I've got a cheaper way of doing that,
###212 that wouldn't require as many soldiers."
###215 The landowner said "What way is that? " He said "Well,
###218 I can project fire from my mouth; I have several things I can do
###222 and people would look at me in amazement and then listen to what I say."
###228 He says "I come from The One-On-High
###230 and that One-On-High can see you
###233 through a mud wall ten feet thick, no matter what you do.
###236 If you take anything that doesn't belong to you, he can see that.
###240 After you kick the bucket you're gonna burn eternally."
###243 That was a method for keeping people to behave
###246 though the king can kill anybody he didn't like:
###249 "Behead that son-of-a-bitch" or "get rid of that culture over there." They all did it;
###253 but "Thou shall not kill" was in that community,
###257 and a wife being obedient made it easier
###260 for otherwise women would protest their state of being.
###263 They had to pledge obedience to the old man, whatever he wanted,
###268 so the old man got his way. If a man worked for somebody
###271 he was not to remove anything that didn't belong to him.
###274 Stealing was a crime,
###276 so the man who conducted magic and did all the magic, controlled a lot of people.
###281 He was the priest in the early days, the soothsayer.
###284 Now the priest was bothered continuously by people.
###288 [They'd] come up and [say] "My son doesn't listen to me."
###291 "My daughter is disobedient" and he said: "Well..."
###295 He was so bothered by people that he made a stone statue.
###299 He said "Anytime you have any problem drop a half a buck off here
###302 and talk to the stone statue! Tell him all the problems you've got."
###306 Some of them did that, but they didn't like the conclusion,
###310 so they destroyed the stone statue.
###312 He made two: one with a smile and one with horns.
###315 He says "The bad one, you yell at, spit on, all that
###319 and the good one you thank for your state-of-being."
###321 These were forms, dead forms made of clay or stone,
###325 and people talked to them all day long. They didn't bother the priests at all.
###329 The priest was off somewhere doing something else.
###331 This is how all these icons came into being
###335 and all the laws and all the contributions.
###339 Jesus walked on water, men walk in space, on the Moon,
###343 so that aspect you can use; but he was not a deity.
###349 He was not another manifestation of God,
###352 nor were any of the great teachers.
###355 Great teachers were great compared to what was available at the time.
###359 The nearest thing to what you would call 'honesty' is science,
###363 the nearest thing, because the system itself checks things out constantly.
###368 You come up with an idea. They put it to test,
###371 and more so than any other system.
###374 Yes, technology makes mistakes, buildings collapse, bridges fall;
###379 but compared to any other system,
###381 it's by far the most outstanding system,
###384 and the only system that we know of that transports people around.
###388 Electrical power gives us refrigerators to keep food in storage.
###393 In other words, science and technology
###395 has given us and freed more people from hard toil and labor
###399 than any philosopher and do-gooder.
###403 Unfortunately, when people see Mother Teresa going around helping people,
###408 they can't grasp some agronomist working alone,
###413 increasing the agricultural yield by five times,
###416 who has fed people who could never of been fed
###419 that would have starved to death. They can't grasp that!
###422 They have to see. If you show normal people movies
###425 of thousands of children with swollen bellies,
###428 suffering, they would get a lump on their throat.
###431 If you want to raise money: one child
###433 crippled, with crutches, moving toward the camera
###437 and when he gets to the camera have him look up and have a tear run down.
###441 You can raise more money than showing 8 million people.
###444 They are pinheads! They are conditioned to utter simplicity.
###449 This is not condemning the human race. I'm condemning the value system,
###454 the indoctrinations that are given by the institutions of higher learning.
###458 They are not institutions of higher learning.
###460 They are detrimental in developing human beings
###464 who are what you would call conscience and aware
###467 of their surroundings and other people.
