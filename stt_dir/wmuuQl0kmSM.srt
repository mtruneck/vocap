[MUSIC PLAYING]


2
0:0:7,5 --> 0:0:8,75
DANI LUV: My name is Dani Luv.


3
0:0:8,75 --> 0:0:9,852
Pick up your hands
and sing with me.


4
0:0:9,852 --> 0:0:10,343
[SINGING]


5
0:0:10,343 --> 0:0:11,816
Da-ee da-ee indo.


6
0:0:11,816 --> 0:0:13,44
Da-ee da-ee indo.


7
0:0:13,44 --> 0:0:15,68
Da-ee da-ee indo.


8
0:0:15,68 --> 0:0:16,309
[INAUDIBLE]


9
0:0:16,309 --> 0:0:17,27
Oh, my god.


10
0:0:17,27 --> 0:0:19,294
Let me tell you, she's
got a great tuckus.


11
0:0:19,294 --> 0:0:21,779
I love this shit.


12
0:0:21,779 --> 0:0:23,27
Oh, look at the two guys
with the camera.


13
0:0:23,27 --> 0:0:25,755
What a bunch of shmucks.


14
0:0:25,755 --> 0:0:26,252
[SINGING]


15
0:0:26,252 --> 0:0:28,24
Hava unda nav a dah.


16
0:0:28,24 --> 0:0:33,21



17
0:0:33,21 --> 0:0:34,46
Mm.


18
0:0:34,46 --> 0:0:42,82



19
0:0:42,82 --> 0:0:45,41
NOAH BERNAMOFF: My name is
Noah Bernamoff, and the


20
0:0:45,41 --> 0:0:49,2
restaurant's name is Mile
End Delicatessen.


21
0:0:49,2 --> 0:0:53,45
Mile End is called Mile End
because of my love for that


22
0:0:53,45 --> 0:0:56,54
neighborhood of Montreal, and
the very, very personal


23
0:0:56,54 --> 0:0:59,51
history of my family in
that neighborhood.


24
0:0:59,51 --> 0:1:1,88
I was a second year
law student.


25
0:1:1,88 --> 0:1:5,96
I just really hated my life.


26
0:1:5,96 --> 0:1:10,8
I started making smoked meat
at home, as a hobby.


27
0:1:10,8 --> 0:1:14,14
That led to me actually thinking
through the idea of a


28
0:1:14,14 --> 0:1:16,89
Jewish deli in any
serious way.


29
0:1:16,89 --> 0:1:19,52
New York's like the most Jewish
place in the world.


30
0:1:19,52 --> 0:1:22,39
Even more Jewish, in many
ways, than even Israel.


31
0:1:22,39 --> 0:1:25,95
And it always struck me that
all these well represented


32
0:1:25,95 --> 0:1:28,61
cultures in this city have
more restaurants


33
0:1:28,61 --> 0:1:30,69
than you can count.


34
0:1:30,69 --> 0:1:31,33
Except Jews.


35
0:1:31,33 --> 0:1:34,22
We just have like three, or
something, like, stupid.


36
0:1:34,22 --> 0:1:36,97
And I just thought to myself,
we should have our own


37
0:1:36,97 --> 0:1:37,63
restaurants.


38
0:1:37,63 --> 0:1:39,4
We should have our
own cuisine.


39
0:1:39,4 --> 0:1:41,8
And the cuisine that everyone
knows is sort of like this


40
0:1:41,8 --> 0:1:42,57
deli thing.


41
0:1:42,57 --> 0:1:45,47
But then we do more than
that at night.


42
0:1:45,47 --> 0:1:48,62
They're not dishes that you
would find in old time


43
0:1:48,62 --> 0:1:51,76
cookbooks from Europe, or
Yiddish cookbooks from the


44
0:1:51,76 --> 0:1:53,76
early period of Jews
in America.


45
0:1:53,76 --> 0:1:56,21
The cooking actually
is innovative.


46
0:1:56,21 --> 0:1:58,7
I mean, it's not really
something that


47
0:1:58,7 --> 0:1:59,82
Jews do, you know?


48
0:1:59,82 --> 0:2:2,89
Jews own businesses, we're
professionals.


49
0:2:2,89 --> 0:2:6,6
We don't actually cook in
this sort of context.


50
0:2:6,6 --> 0:2:9,69
The kasha dinner is really,
really popular, because it's


51
0:2:9,69 --> 0:2:12,89
kind of it's like this
healthiness of the grain, has


52
0:2:12,89 --> 0:2:15,39
the noodles, has some
meat in it.


53
0:2:15,39 --> 0:2:17,605
It's kind of rich, but it's kind
of light at the same time


54
0:2:17,605 --> 0:2:19,73
and somewhat healthful.


55
0:2:19,73 --> 0:2:21,79
Kasha is generally a
pretty gross thing.


56
0:2:21,79 --> 0:2:22,19
Like--


57
0:2:22,19 --> 0:2:25,22
SAM FILLORAMO: That's
what everyone says.


58
0:2:25,22 --> 0:2:28,31
NOAH BERNAMOFF: Most people
make it and it sucks.


59
0:2:28,31 --> 0:2:29,61
Like my mom's.


60
0:2:29,61 --> 0:2:30,86
No offense to my mom.


61
0:2:30,86 --> 0:2:34,13



62
0:2:34,13 --> 0:2:37,77
My wife, Rae, she handles a lot
of our customer service


63
0:2:37,77 --> 0:2:38,56
side of the business.


64
0:2:38,56 --> 0:2:41,49
She does all the catering,
off-site events.


65
0:2:41,49 --> 0:2:44,84
We've been very picky with who
we've hired as our staff.


66
0:2:44,84 --> 0:2:47,72
And partly because we
care so much about


67
0:2:47,72 --> 0:2:50,142
the camaraderie aspect.


68
0:2:50,142 --> 0:2:51,104
All right.


69
0:2:51,104 --> 0:2:52,66
Very classic.


70
0:2:52,66 --> 0:2:52,547
SAM FILLORAMO: Cheers.


71
0:2:52,547 --> 0:2:53,509
RAE COHEN: L'chaim.


72
0:2:53,509 --> 0:2:54,15
NOAH BERNAMOFF: Cheers.


73
0:2:54,15 --> 0:2:55,66
A lot of gravy [INAUDIBLE]
in this.


74
0:2:55,66 --> 0:3:3,1



75
0:3:3,1 --> 0:3:6,75
We all headed to Russ &
Daughters, a appetizing shop


76
0:3:6,75 --> 0:3:8,726
in lower East Side.


77
0:3:8,726 --> 0:3:10,79
SAM FILLORAMO: I bought a Russ
& Daughters t-shirt couple


78
0:3:10,79 --> 0:3:12,898
months ago from them.


79
0:3:12,898 --> 0:3:18,48
And she was like, now you pay
me to advertise the store.


80
0:3:18,48 --> 0:3:19,42
All right, I will.


81
0:3:19,42 --> 0:3:21,145
That's fine.


82
0:3:21,145 --> 0:3:22,52
NOAH BERNAMOFF: Love that.


83
0:3:22,52 --> 0:3:24,23
Such a Jewish thing to say.


84
0:3:24,23 --> 0:3:39,306



85
0:3:39,306 --> 0:3:41,54
Russ & Daughters, it's
an amazing place.


86
0:3:41,54 --> 0:3:44,94
I mean, you walk in there and
it's just like, whoa, this


87
0:3:44,94 --> 0:3:48,43
place has not changed in as many
years as it's been open.


88
0:3:48,43 --> 0:3:50,87
I think it's been open
85 years now.


89
0:3:50,87 --> 0:3:53,48
And what's so cool is when you
look up and you see the photos


90
0:3:53,48 --> 0:3:56,37
of the original owners, or like,
even the second or third


91
0:3:56,37 --> 0:3:57,33
generation owners.


92
0:3:57,33 --> 0:3:59,58
And you look at where they're
standing in the store, and


93
0:3:59,58 --> 0:4:2,13
then you look at that spot in
the store, they're actually--


94
0:4:2,13 --> 0:4:5,7
you know, it's the same products
sitting in the same


95
0:4:5,7 --> 0:4:6,88
case, in front of them.


96
0:4:6,88 --> 0:4:9,375
When I see that, it's
just unbelievable.


97
0:4:9,375 --> 0:4:14,64
The history in there is
profound, that's for sure.


98
0:4:14,64 --> 0:4:19,589
Our friend, Josh Tupper, who is
a fourth generation owner


99
0:4:19,589 --> 0:4:20,463
of Russ & Daughters.


100
0:4:20,463 --> 0:4:23,9
JOSH TUPPER: Let's
go make eggs.


101
0:4:23,9 --> 0:4:27,91
So this is one of my favorite
little treats, caviar in a


102
0:4:27,91 --> 0:4:29,19
soft scramble.


103
0:4:29,19 --> 0:4:31,48
NOAH BERNAMOFF: We soft
scrambled some eggs, and threw


104
0:4:31,48 --> 0:4:33,48
some caviar into it.


105
0:4:33,48 --> 0:4:35,7
And ate that on a sliced
challah rolls.


106
0:4:35,7 --> 0:4:40,11



107
0:4:40,11 --> 0:4:41,24
JOSH TUPPER: Mm.


108
0:4:41,24 --> 0:4:41,9
NOAH BERNAMOFF: That's it?


109
0:4:41,9 --> 0:4:42,625
That's where it's at?


110
0:4:42,625 --> 0:4:43,85
JOSH TUPPER: Uh, huh.


111
0:4:43,85 --> 0:4:45,68
I'd make you guys one but
I'm too busy eating.


112
0:4:45,68 --> 0:4:58,12



113
0:4:58,12 --> 0:5:2,294
NOAH BERNAMOFF: Seriously,
you should sell this.


114
0:5:2,294 --> 0:5:3,647
JOSH TUPPER: This is
an expensive--


115
0:5:3,647 --> 0:5:4,71
RAE COHEN: How much
would it cost.


116
0:5:4,71 --> 0:5:5,42
JOSH TUPPER: $50.


117
0:5:5,42 --> 0:5:8,73
SAM FILLORAMO: And you have
to cook it yourself.


118
0:5:8,73 --> 0:5:12,0
NOAH BERNAMOFF: Seriously,
Josh, this is heaven.


119
0:5:12,0 --> 0:5:13,47
SAM FILLORAMO: All right, we
should have some shots.


120
0:5:13,47 --> 0:5:14,32
NOAH BERNAMOFF: Yeah.


121
0:5:14,32 --> 0:5:15,61
You're going to need
to do a shot.


122
0:5:15,61 --> 0:5:17,6
Cheers.


123
0:5:17,6 --> 0:5:18,33
SAM FILLORAMO: Thanks
again for having us.


124
0:5:18,33 --> 0:5:19,42
NOAH BERNAMOFF: To our
gracious hosts.


125
0:5:19,42 --> 0:5:19,8
JOSH TUPPER: Wonderful.


126
0:5:19,8 --> 0:5:20,25
Beautiful.


127
0:5:20,25 --> 0:5:23,804
NOAH BERNAMOFF: You
already drank it?


128
0:5:23,804 --> 0:5:24,77
Fuck.


129
0:5:24,77 --> 0:5:26,7
JOSH TUPPER: We might
have an issue.


130
0:5:26,7 --> 0:5:27,955
This is cold.


131
0:5:27,955 --> 0:5:32,13
It's called Devil's Springs,
but it's 160 proof.


132
0:5:32,13 --> 0:5:33,54
NOAH BERNAMOFF: Dude.


133
0:5:33,54 --> 0:5:36,54
SAM FILLORAMO: 160 proof
bottle from New Jersey.


134
0:5:36,54 --> 0:5:37,3
JOSH TUPPER: It's Brucha.


135
0:5:37,3 --> 0:5:39,69
NOAH BERNAMOFF: Hold on, Devil
Springs is in New Jersey?


136
0:5:39,69 --> 0:5:41,2
Where else?


137
0:5:41,2 --> 0:5:43,377
Vodka is the typical pairing
for a lot of the


138
0:5:43,377 --> 0:5:44,184
foods that they have.


139
0:5:44,184 --> 0:5:45,15
They have the smoked fish.


140
0:5:45,15 --> 0:5:49,46
In fact, a lot of fish is cured
in a vodka solution.


141
0:5:49,46 --> 0:5:51,61
We did a little taste
test of herrings.


142
0:5:51,61 --> 0:5:54,68
We did a shmaltz herring,
pickled herring,


143
0:5:54,68 --> 0:5:57,45
and a Holland herring.


144
0:5:57,45 --> 0:5:59,51
Life is very good, right now.


145
0:5:59,51 --> 0:6:3,4
We're in the middle of Russ &
Daughters, the greatest Jewish


146
0:6:3,4 --> 0:6:4,65
institution.


147
0:6:4,65 --> 0:6:5,14
All right.


148
0:6:5,14 --> 0:6:5,69
Cheers.


149
0:6:5,69 --> 0:6:6,94
Thank you.


150
0:6:6,94 --> 0:6:13,96



151
0:6:13,96 --> 0:6:16,6
So after Russ & Daughters we
headed over to Sammy's


152
0:6:16,6 --> 0:6:17,85
Roumanian Steakhouse.


153
0:6:17,85 --> 0:6:22,34



154
0:6:22,34 --> 0:6:24,1
It's a really wacky place.


155
0:6:24,1 --> 0:6:27,56
The keyboard player, the
whole shtick there.


156
0:6:27,56 --> 0:6:30,85
The dancing, the block of
vodka on the table.


157
0:6:30,85 --> 0:6:33,46
It's just by pure
Jewish kitch.


158
0:6:33,46 --> 0:6:36,67
Russ & Daughters remain
in the family.


159
0:6:36,67 --> 0:6:38,9
And it's gone, over
the years, it's


160
0:6:38,9 --> 0:6:39,81
become fancier and fancier.


161
0:6:39,81 --> 0:6:43,7
Where at Sammy's it seems like
it's just sort of devolved


162
0:6:43,7 --> 0:6:45,43
over the years into being
kitchier, kitchier.


163
0:6:45,43 --> 0:6:49,32
And like, just kind of held
up with its kitch.


164
0:6:49,32 --> 0:6:52,67
We ate chopped liver, which was
mixed at the table, which


165
0:6:52,67 --> 0:6:54,8
was excellent.


166
0:6:54,8 --> 0:6:58,72
We had the karnatzlack, which is
like a rolled sausagey sort


167
0:6:58,72 --> 0:7:2,678
of thing with a ton of garlic.


168
0:7:2,678 --> 0:7:4,1
Look at this sandwich.


169
0:7:4,1 --> 0:7:8,166
A chopped liver karnatzlack
pickled green tomato sandwich.


170
0:7:8,166 --> 0:7:11,5
SAM FILLORAMO: Mom
would be proud.


171
0:7:11,5 --> 0:7:12,75
NOAH BERNAMOFF: This
is phenomenal.


172
0:7:12,75 --> 0:7:15,21



173
0:7:15,21 --> 0:7:17,1
There was a lot of vodka
shots there.


174
0:7:17,1 --> 0:7:21,63
We consumed another whole
bottle of vodka.


175
0:7:21,63 --> 0:7:25,4
We had what Sammy's calls
their tenderloin steak.


176
0:7:25,4 --> 0:7:27,78
And we really loved it.


177
0:7:27,78 --> 0:7:30,74
There's only one Jewish
variation on the steakhouse in


178
0:7:30,74 --> 0:7:32,786
New York City, and
that's Sammy's.


179
0:7:32,786 --> 0:7:33,52
DAVID ZIMMERMAN:
How's it going?


180
0:7:33,52 --> 0:7:33,95
NOAH BERNAMOFF: Awesome.


181
0:7:33,95 --> 0:7:35,3
DAVID ZIMMERMAN: Realy.


182
0:7:35,3 --> 0:7:36,65
I'm David.


183
0:7:36,65 --> 0:7:37,53
NOAH BERNAMOFF: Noah.


184
0:7:37,53 --> 0:7:38,46
DAVID ZIMMERMAN: I'm
the son of Sammy.


185
0:7:38,46 --> 0:7:40,785
NOAH BERNAMOFF: Son of Sam--


186
0:7:40,785 --> 0:7:41,715
Thanks for having us.


187
0:7:41,715 --> 0:7:43,11
DAVID ZIMMERMAN: Ah,
you're welcome.


188
0:7:43,11 --> 0:7:45,4
The restaurants been here
for about 80 years.


189
0:7:45,4 --> 0:7:49,0
My father won the restaurant
in a poker game in 1975,


190
0:7:49,0 --> 0:7:50,83
against Sammy.


191
0:7:50,83 --> 0:7:52,772
So there is no Sammy here.


192
0:7:52,772 --> 0:7:54,25
SAM FILLORAMO: It's
the Jewish--


193
0:7:54,25 --> 0:7:56,98
NOAH BERNAMOFF: Is it always
a Bar Mitzvah every night?


194
0:7:56,98 --> 0:7:58,23
SAM FILLORAMO: We try.


195
0:7:58,23 --> 0:8:2,79



196
0:8:2,79 --> 0:8:6,722
DANI LUV: I want to see the
boys just come alive.


197
0:8:6,722 --> 0:8:9,71
Hey boys, you came late,
you have to do it.


198
0:8:9,71 --> 0:8:10,78
Leave your--


199
0:8:10,78 --> 0:8:13,52
leave your vodka, that's
right, that's a Jew.


200
0:8:13,52 --> 0:8:14,87
That's a Jew-bird, come on.


201
0:8:14,87 --> 0:8:17,32
He's walking towards the circle,
he's still eating--


202
0:8:17,32 --> 0:8:20,55



203
0:8:20,55 --> 0:8:22,41
I want to see at least
20, 30 people.


204
0:8:22,41 --> 0:8:24,338
My name is Dani Luv,

Poutine actually literally
translates as hot mess.

But what it actually
is is French fries,

cheddar curd, and gravy.

gut busting dish.

kind of thinking we should

267
0:11:15,23 --> 0:11:18,7
It's also like truck driver
food, but, because it's such a

unique thing that you can't
really get anywhere in New
