0:0:28,94 --> 0:0:31,9
Female Speaker
  I'm honored to bring before you 
today a group of distinguished


3
0:0:31,9 --> 0:0:35,69
leaders who've helped navigate 
our state and country through some


4
0:0:35,69 --> 0:0:39,55
of the most difficult and important
natural resource issues of our time.


5
0:0:39,55 --> 0:0:44,32
These individuals have led in the
US Senate, have led US agencies


6
0:0:44,32 --> 0:0:48,54
including the US Environmental Protection
Agency, the US Fish and wildlife


7
0:0:48,54 --> 0:0:52,3
Service, the Department of State
International Environment and scientific


8
0:0:52,3 --> 0:0:57,27
affairs, have led us as the governor
of the State of Wyoming, have led


9
0:0:57,27 --> 0:1:2,1
us as senators in Wyoming, have led
us as ambassadors to foreign countries,


10
0:1:2,1 --> 0:1:6,85
and led a US commission on financial
responsibility and reform.  They


11
0:1:6,85 --> 0:1:11,59
have led major conservation and scientific
foundations, the Conservation Fund,


12
0:1:11,59 --> 0:1:15,96
and the World Resources Institute.
 These individuals have dedicated


13
0:1:15,96 --> 0:1:20,67
themselves to leading through collaboration
which is our topic today.  Through


14
0:1:20,67 --> 0:1:24,35
crossing the divides that occur between
the values and interests surrounding


15
0:1:24,35 --> 0:1:30,5
thorny natural resource issues.
 DDT, wolves, spotted owls, salmon,


16
0:1:30,5 --> 0:1:36,5
land management conflicts, agriculture,
energy development and conservation


17
0:1:36,5 --> 0:1:40,43
and balancing those.  They have mastered
and applied for decades the art


18
0:1:40,43 --> 0:1:45,74
of bringing people together and finding
common goals.  From its conception


19
0:1:45,74 --> 0:1:49,6
to our current day activities, these
individuals have helped shape the


20
0:1:49,6 --> 0:1:53,89
Ruckelshaus Institute University
of Wyoming for over 20 years.


21
0:1:53,89 --> 0:1:58,0
All of them have served and 2 still
 do, on the board of the Ruckelshaus


22
0:1:58,0 --> 0:2:3,47
Institute, uh and as chairs of the
 Ruckelshaus Institute. As holds


23
0:2:3,47 --> 0:2:6,94
true when they helped create the
Institute today the mission of the


24
0:2:6,94 --> 0:2:10,92
Ruckelshaus Institute is to advance
the understanding and solution of


25
0:2:10,92 --> 0:2:15,87
complex environment and natural resources
challenges and support stake holder


26
0:2:15,87 --> 0:2:19,9
driven solutions to environmental
challenges by communicating important


27
0:2:19,9 --> 0:2:24,98
research and promoting collaborative
decision making.  It is a great


28
0:2:24,98 --> 0:2:28,73
honor to bring together Mike
Sullivan, Senator Al Simpson, John


29
0:2:28,73 --> 0:2:32,13
Turner, and Bill Ruckelshaus. Let's 
give a warm thanks to their coming.


30
0:2:32,13 --> 0:2:36,8
[Applause]


31
0:2:36,8 --> 0:2:39,7
Mike Sullivan
Thank you very much in the uh in the and


32
0:2:39,7 --> 0:2:43,89
good afternoon ladies and gentleman.
 I feel a bit like I'm standing


33
0:2:43,89 --> 0:2:49,21
on a precipice with a boulder and
all I have to do is push the boulder


34
0:2:49,21 --> 0:2:53,33
and watch it roll for a couple of
hours because I don't know how you


35
0:2:53,33 --> 0:2:58,76
could facilitate or moderate 
these 3 individuals.  [Laughter]


36
0:2:58,76 --> 0:3:3,88
but every now and then I may, uh, may
step in and see if there is anything


37
0:3:3,88 --> 0:3:7,32
that that I can ask that you might
be interested in and then I think


38
0:3:7,32 --> 0:3:11,52
at the end of the uh session we are
going to have about toward the end


39
0:3:11,52 --> 0:3:17,12
of the session if we could dampenem 
down a little we'll have about


40
0:3:17,12 --> 0:3:20,49
20 minutes for you to ask questions
that would be of interest to you.


41
0:3:20,49 --> 0:3:25,88
Let me start by just talking about
the collaborative process for maybe


42
0:3:25,88 --> 0:3:32,34
30 seconds because of we have a a
number of experts in collaboration


43
0:3:32,34 --> 0:3:38,7
and other means of negotiations sitting
sitting  here but uh it was clear


44
0:3:38,7 --> 0:3:43,82
20 years ago when the Ruckelshaus
Institute was formed that the sensitive


45
0:3:43,82 --> 0:3:48,71
issues in Wyoming and and most of
those surround natural resources


46
0:3:48,71 --> 0:3:55,53
and the environment needed to have
some kind of a different forum or


47
0:3:55,53 --> 0:4:1,17
process by which some of these issues
could be resolved.  And uh to the


48
0:4:1,17 --> 0:4:5,71
credit of the University and the Ruckelshaus
Institute and the group including


49
0:4:5,71 --> 0:4:13,1
Al and John and and others, Craig
Thomas who, who helped start it, uh,


50
0:4:13,1 --> 0:4:18,13
we decided to start a a group to
try to focus on a collaborative


51
0:4:18,13 --> 0:4:23,35
process and bring together a number
of advisory boards members who could


52
0:4:23,35 --> 0:4:29,19
provide some expertise not only in
the uh process but in various issues


53
0:4:29,19 --> 0:4:37,0
and act as a forum to help resolve
issues.  Bill Ruckelshaus, uh, generously


54
0:4:37,0 --> 0:4:41,7
gave this time from the beginning
and, and uh we've all been very grateful


55
0:4:41,7 --> 0:4:46,37
for that and we're grateful for him
to make the trip out here into the


56
0:4:46,37 --> 0:4:51,2
wilderness uh for this session today.
 [Laughter.]  Uh I was thinking


57
0:4:51,2 --> 0:4:54,47
as Jane and I were driving in from
Casper about the collaborative process


58
0:4:54,47 --> 0:5:3,64
and you know in today's time it seems
like compromise and collaboration


59
0:5:3,64 --> 0:5:10,47
has taken on almost a four letter
word sort of context and and that


60
0:5:10,47 --> 0:5:13,37
has get to be wrong.  There is no
magic to the collaborative process.


61
0:5:13,37 --> 0:5:18,36
It's the way we get along on a daily
basis and I was thinking Jane and


62
0:5:18,36 --> 0:5:22,91
I have been getting along for 50
years collaborating.  [Laughter]


63
0:5:22,91 --> 0:5:27,16
and uh so I don't know that there
is a lot of magic to it but it does


64
0:5:27,16 --> 0:5:34,38
take patience and perseverance. 
And uh we have three people some


65
0:5:34,38 --> 0:5:39,23
have more patience than others on
this panel but uh but they've certainly


66
0:5:39,23 --> 0:5:45,5
have been exposed to it.  So let
me introduce John is a Wyoming native


67
0:5:45,5 --> 0:5:49,89
as most of you would know.  He is
from Jackson Hole and Moose uh he


68
0:5:49,89 --> 0:5:56,27
is a long time rancher family ranch
at Triangle X outside of Jackson


69
0:5:56,27 --> 0:6:3,0
and has contributed and served the
public of Wyoming both within the


70
0:6:3,0 --> 0:6:7,19
the state legislature and the Senate.
 He was president of the Senate


71
0:6:7,19 --> 0:6:11,86
while I was governor.  And I was
please to have the the opportunity


72
0:6:11,86 --> 0:6:16,3
to serve with him.  Before he went
uh to Washington D.C. to become


73
0:6:16,3 --> 0:6:20,51
director of the Fish and Wildlife
Service, a place where a lot of


74
0:6:20,51 --> 0:6:28,97
collaboration and sensitive issues
exist, uh he he then served as chairman


75
0:6:28,97 --> 0:6:34,81
or director of the Conservation Fund
and uh left that position to become


76
0:6:34,81 --> 0:6:37,94
Assistant Secretary of Motions and
International Environmental and


77
0:6:37,94 --> 0:6:43,1
Scientific Affairs which he is going
to have to tell you what they do.


78
0:6:43,1 --> 0:6:49,52
But I can tell you they do remarkable
work throughout the world with uh


79
0:6:49,52 --> 0:6:57,89
various sensitive subjects and fragile
environments.  Uh John served 19


80
0:6:57,89 --> 0:7:2,36
years in the Wyoming legislature
representing North Lincoln and Sublette


81
0:7:2,36 --> 0:7:9,46
and Teton counties where there are
always controversies.  And he's


82
0:7:9,46 --> 0:7:16,26
remained a partner in the Triangle
X Ranch, a family dude ranch and


83
0:7:16,26 --> 0:7:19,66
outfitting operation in Jackson.
 Please welcome John Turner.


84
0:7:19,66 --> 0:7:28,18
[Applause]


85
0:7:28,18 --> 0:7:33,43
Bill Ruckelshaus.  Bill is currently
strategic director of the Natrona


86
0:7:33,43 --> 0:7:37,27
group by way of background he was
a member of the Indiana House of


87
0:7:37,27 --> 0:7:42,62
Representatives and its majority
leader from 1967 to 69.  The president


88
0:7:42,62 --> 0:7:49,72
appointed him uh for the years 1969
and 1970 as assistant attorney general


89
0:7:49,72 --> 0:7:53,49
in charge of the Civil Division of
the US department of justice and


90
0:7:53,49 --> 0:7:57,47
that would cover the two hours that
we have here if he wanted to tell


91
0:7:57,47 --> 0:8:3,54
us about that.  Uh alone uh but you're
not going to get a chance to do


92
0:8:3,54 --> 0:8:12,68
that.  [Laughing.]  He became uh
the United States Environmental


93
0:8:12,68 --> 0:8:17,55
Protection Agency's first administrator
when it was formed in December of


94
0:8:17,55 --> 0:8:23,25
1970 and served until 1973 and I
asked him was it 3 times you were


95
0:8:23,25 --> 0:8:27,62
Environmental uh Protection Agency
director and he said no it was only


96
0:8:27,62 --> 0:8:33,93
2 but he was there in in Washington
so often that I thought he served


97
0:8:33,93 --> 0:8:38,25
under 4 or 5 presidents in that capacity.
 In April of 73 he was appointed


98
0:8:38,25 --> 0:8:42,59
acting director of the Federal Bureau
of Investigation.  Just to provide


99
0:8:42,59 --> 0:8:46,85
a little diversity to his to his
interests.  And uh the same year


100
0:8:46,85 --> 0:8:50,16
was appointed deputy attorney general
for the Department of Justice.


101
0:8:50,16 --> 0:8:55,22
He was pres- he was appointed by president
Reagan as the 5th EPA administrator


102
0:8:55,22 --> 0:9:0,47
until 1985.  He's founding director
and board member of the Initiative


103
0:9:0,47 --> 0:9:3,83
of Global Development, chairs the
William D. Ruckelshaus Center at


104
0:9:3,83 --> 0:9:11,27
Washington State Univ- University.
 And I suspect that there are five


105
0:9:11,27 --> 0:9:18,98
or ten other very high profile environmental
uh study groups and others including


106
0:9:18,98 --> 0:9:22,95
one you were telling me about about
ocean acidification in Washington


107
0:9:22,95 --> 0:9:28,28
that Bill has been chosen and acts
as chairman or a member because


108
0:9:28,28 --> 0:9:33,84
of the great contribution he brings
to those groups.  He's also a probably


109
0:9:33,84 --> 0:9:38,34
this is the most sterling of his
uh resume he's a board emeritus


110
0:9:38,34 --> 0:9:41,98
member of the World Research Institute
and the University of Wyoming Ruckelshaus


111
0:9:41,98 --> 0:9:45,45
Institute.  [Laughter.]
Please welcome Bill Ruckelshaus.


112
0:9:45,45 --> 0:9:54,27
[Applause.]


113
0:9:54,27 --> 0:9:59,85
Alan K. something something. 
[Laughter.]  What can I say that


114
0:9:59,85 --> 0:10:11,0
hasn't been said?  Alan served 14
years, was it, in then 13 years


115
0:10:11,0 --> 0:10:16,4
in the Wyoming legislature.  Uh the
first time as a very baby lawyer


116
0:10:16,4 --> 0:10:19,91
that I ever approached legislature
for anything Al took me under his


117
0:10:19,91 --> 0:10:26,76
wing and I've been grateful and indebted
to him ever since.  He served from


118
0:10:26,76 --> 0:10:33,1
1979 to 1997 as United States senator
from Wyoming.  He was most recently


119
0:10:33,1 --> 0:10:39,41
appointed in 2010 to co-chair President
Obama's National Commission on Fiscal


120
0:10:39,41 --> 0:10:44,66
Responsibility and Reform.  Which
was a small little job he was asked


121
0:10:44,66 --> 0:10:53,26
to do and uh he he he built it into
a really big thing.  [Laughter.]


122
0:10:53,26 --> 0:11:1,33
And uh and we're all the better
for his having undertaken that uh


123
0:11:1,33 --> 0:11:7,1
position.  He taught at the Shorenstein
Center on press politics and public


124
0:11:7,1 --> 0:11:11,29
policy at Harvard University and
served at the John F. Kennedy School


125
0:11:11,29 --> 0:11:16,38
of Government in Cambridge, Massachusetts
the direct as director of the institute


126
0:11:16,38 --> 0:11:23,77
politics where he inoculated the
Harvard campus with his own western


127
0:11:23,77 --> 0:11:27,53
wit and personality.  And I don't
know whether you've noticed but


128
0:11:27,53 --> 0:11:32,59
it's never been the same since. 
[Laughter.]  He teaches periodically


129
0:11:32,59 --> 0:11:36,65
at the University of Wyoming and
spends a good deal of time promoting


130
0:11:36,65 --> 0:11:44,1
the University and Wyoming throughout
the country.  He is a Cody boy.


131
0:11:44,1 --> 0:11:46,87
Please welcome Alan Simpson.


132
0:11:46,87 --> 0:11:56,7
[Applause.]


133
0:11:56,7 --> 0:11:57,86
I am going to ask Bill Ruckelshaus 
to start and just give a a short


134
0:11:57,86 --> 0:12:6,49
overview of your experience
with collaborative process


135
0:12:6,49 --> 0:12:9,83
Bill Ruckelshaus
I  think it's as good as uh jumping on


136
0:12:9,83 --> 0:12:14,1
point point as any to describe what 
collaborative processes are all about.


137
0:12:14,1 --> 0:12:23,47
And why universities could be the center for a 
place like the Institute. uh As you all know


138
0:12:23,47 --> 0:12:26,47
we've had trouble in this country
over the last couple of decades


139
0:12:26,47 --> 0:12:33,7
in arriving at decisions.  Uh the
level of civil discourse particularly


140
0:12:33,7 --> 0:12:37,73
at the national level has not been
very high or edifying.  And it gets


141
0:12:37,73 --> 0:12:44,2
in the way uh uh I think of rational
address to our nation's problems.


142
0:12:44,2 --> 0:12:48,68
So we can bring our hands about
that and say what caused it, what


143
0:12:48,68 --> 0:12:52,85
can we do about it, why don't people
treat one another better, but it's more


144
0:12:52,85 --> 0:12:57,52
helpful I think to talk about that
kind of problem within the context


145
0:12:57,52 --> 0:13:4,15
of a of a solution to a multi interest
multi party type of problem.  Which


146
0:13:4,15 --> 0:13:10,14
collaborative processes really work
pretty well for.  Uh use of collaboration


147
0:13:10,14 --> 0:13:16,59
to make decisions is not a new thing
in this country.  We have uh in


148
0:13:16,59 --> 0:13:21,55
Jeffersonian days uh farm raising
exercises and neighbors helping


149
0:13:21,55 --> 0:13:25,9
neighbors uh solve their own problems.
 And we were as a nation kind of


150
0:13:25,9 --> 0:13:30,8
founded on that. But one of the problems
with collaborative issues have


151
0:13:30,8 --> 0:13:37,5
today is they compete very strongly
for the judiciary, executive, legislative


152
0:13:37,5 --> 0:13:43,22
branches of decision making.  Which
some of this uh lack of civil discourse


153
0:13:43,22 --> 0:13:49,73
lack of harmony exists today and
it's sometimes hard for these collaborative


154
0:13:49,73 --> 0:13:54,3
processes to break through because
they're dealing with uh dispute


155
0:13:54,3 --> 0:13:59,69
resolution institutions that are lodged 
in our constitution.  And it is


156
0:13:59,69 --> 0:14:4,68
trying there.  And there are automatic
sources of funding for these cat


157
0:14:4,68 --> 0:14:9,65
these ways of resolving societal
disputes. Well one of the ways


158
0:14:9,65 --> 0:14:15,97
of of of avoiding that is to simply
let universities with their enormous


159
0:14:15,97 --> 0:14:22,9
capacity for uh for knowledge for
the generation of knowledge for


160
0:14:22,9 --> 0:14:25,73
the uh taking that knowledge and
applying it to the social problems


161
0:14:25,73 --> 0:14:31,6
uh and providing a readout where
people can come together around


162
0:14:31,6 --> 0:14:34,24
their problems and sit at the same
table and listen to one another.


163
0:14:34,24 --> 0:14:40,0
This uh when Alan, it's really
Alan's fault that I got involved in the University


164
0:14:40,0 --> 0:14:48,98
of Washington, uh Wyoming, sorry,
it wasn't your fault and asked me


165
0:14:48,98 --> 0:14:53,69
to come and and help the University
try to sort out what they could


166
0:14:53,69 --> 0:14:57,13
do to make a significant impact on
natural resource kind of issues.


167
0:14:57,13 --> 0:15:1,33
Well we spent a couple of weekends
at it with a very distinguished


168
0:15:1,33 --> 0:15:6,33
board, several of whom are here in
this audience, uh and to try to


169
0:15:6,33 --> 0:15:14,52
figure out what we could do that
would be helpful for Wyoming in


170
0:15:14,52 --> 0:15:14,6
trying to resolve some of their natural
resources disputes. And so what


171
0:15:14,6 --> 0:15:18,12
we decided was the University is
a very good place to have people


172
0:15:18,12 --> 0:15:23,62
gather to come uh in Wyoming, almost
literally lay their guns down at


173
0:15:23,62 --> 0:15:25,5
the door and come in and talk to
one another.


174
0:15:25,5 --> 0:15:27,36
Male Speaker:
Not anymore!


175
0:15:27,36 --> 0:15:31,78
Bill Ruckelshaus
and and really listen to 
one another as they discuss


176
0:15:31,78 --> 0:15:37,11
what a problem looked like from their
perspective.  And collaborative


177
0:15:37,11 --> 0:15:42,14
processes give people an opportunity
to not only talk to one another


178
0:15:42,14 --> 0:15:48,88
in a civil way but to listen and
once that once that trust builds


179
0:15:48,88 --> 0:15:53,14
up within one of these collaborative
processes.  So that people began


180
0:15:53,14 --> 0:15:56,61
to talk and listen to one another
real progress starts to be made.


181
0:15:56,61 --> 0:16:1,37
And universities are a wonderful
place to make that happen.  They


182
0:16:1,37 --> 0:16:5,86
have research capacities, they have
the teaching uh responsibilities,


183
0:16:5,86 --> 0:16:8,99
and they have outreach, particularly
in land grant colleges like Wyoming


184
0:16:8,99 --> 0:16:15,12
have uh have uh have have uh an obligation
to reach out into the community


185
0:16:15,12 --> 0:16:19,57
and try to help help resolve disputes.
All of these things are involved


186
0:16:19,57 --> 0:16:25,7
in collaborative process.  The faculty
can be made available to help resolve


187
0:16:25,7 --> 0:16:32,4
difficult scientific questions, uh
they can use the students and graduate


188
0:16:32,4 --> 0:16:37,2
students as uh uh as helpers in trying
to gather information.  In fact


189
0:16:37,2 --> 0:16:43,24
that will inform the discussion but
then they provide this uh uh literally


190
0:16:43,24 --> 0:16:47,78
an arena where people can come together
and talk to one another in a civil way.


191
0:16:47,78 --> 0:16:51,26
Out of that if they're properly
structured, if they're properly


192
0:16:51,26 --> 0:16:55,73
sponsored by the government or the
governor and legislatures and if


193
0:16:55,73 --> 0:17:0,49
the people themselves are desirous
of coming to a harmonized solution


194
0:17:0,49 --> 0:17:6,89
to their problems enormous progress
can be made.  And and issues that


195
0:17:6,89 --> 0:17:9,84
just seemed intractable and been
around for decades can be solved.


196
0:17:9,84 --> 0:17:13,24
We have any number of them in the
state of Wyoming as well as other


197
0:17:13,24 --> 0:17:17,42
states where institutes like this
have been created over the last


198
0:17:17,42 --> 0:17:21,57
few decades. So collaborative
processes hold great promise I think


199
0:17:21,57 --> 0:17:28,19
for trying to get uh at disputes
that seem intractable uh and at


200
0:17:28,19 --> 0:17:32,69
the same time allow us to to come
to a conclusion that is durable


201
0:17:32,69 --> 0:17:37,57
primarily because it is one that
satisfies all the people around


202
0:17:37,57 --> 0:17:40,85
the table they know they've had a
chance to be heard.  They know their


203
0:17:40,85 --> 0:17:44,58
interests have been taken into account.
 They figured out how to harmonize


204
0:17:44,58 --> 0:17:48,41
harmonize their interest with those
of the rest of the people at the


205
0:17:48,41 --> 0:17:52,58
table.  So when you get a solution
out of one of these processes, it


206
0:17:52,58 --> 0:17:56,39
is a lot more durable than one where
you end up with a corner of the


207
0:17:56,39 --> 0:18:2,0
legislature where they can be overturned
by such and such proceeding.  That's


208
0:18:2,0 --> 0:18:6,6
seemed way too detailed a 
fashion to do what you asked.


209
0:18:6,6 --> 0:18:9,21
Mike Sullivan
   I'll uh uh let me just ask you.


210
0:18:9,21 --> 0:18:14,4
because you're most recent work on the 
National Commission for Fiscal Responsibility


211
0:18:14,4 --> 0:18:21,72
which might be viewed as a collaborative 
process by some.  [Laughter.]


212
0:18:21,72 --> 0:18:25,89
Uh how would you characterize the tenor
 of the current public debate


213
0:18:25,89 --> 0:18:33,46
and what does it say about the need or the 
uh inability to have collaborative processes?


214
0:18:33,46 --> 0:18:35,15
Alan Simpson
Well first let <font color="#FFFFFF"><b>me uh,</b></font>


215
0:18:35,15 --> 0:18:37,2
Mike Sullivan
Turn your microphone on?


216
0:18:37,2 --> 0:18:39,95
Alan Simpson
Yes, I uh I see that I've fouled it up.


217
0:18:39,95 --> 0:18:40,62
Mike Sullivan
Here. [Laughter]


218
0:18:40,62 --> 0:18:41,38
Bill Ruckelshaus
There's a screw loose


219
0:18:41,38 --> 0:18:43,66
Mike Sullivan
let me work on it.


220
0:18:43,66 --> 0:18:47,8
Alan Simpson
Oh I have it I have it now.


221
0:18:47,8 --> 0:18:50,14
[Laughter]


222
0:18:50,14 --> 0:18:50,58
Mike Sullivan
Well Alan it's called a switch!


223
0:18:50,58 --> 0:18:53,11
[Laughter]


224
0:18:53,11 --> 0:18:54,4
Alan Simpson
I don't have to take that! [Laughter]


225
0:18:54,4 --> 0:19:1,86
Just quickly, I served in the legislature
with this delightful man and we


226
0:19:1,86 --> 0:19:7,58
he put a bill in to do conservation
easements.  Let me tell you that


227
0:19:7,58 --> 0:19:12,34
was back in the 70s.  You think that
was popular you're goofy.  And we


228
0:19:12,34 --> 0:19:15,8
lost that by one vote.  They thought
I was a commie after I finished that.


229
0:19:15,8 --> 0:19:17,28
[Laughter]


230
0:19:17,28 --> 0:19:19,98
Uh, but my training came,
 I'll answer your question,


231
0:19:19,98 --> 0:19:24,92
I was on the Park County Zoning and
Planning Commission in the 60s.


232
0:19:24,92 --> 0:19:31,23
So I know what hell is from the
origins of hell.  We were saying


233
0:19:31,23 --> 0:19:34,57
"if you want to have a two story
purple outhouse on your property,


234
0:19:34,57 --> 0:19:40,82
by God it's America!"  " You will have
have a two story outhouse...." well


235
0:19:40,82 --> 0:19:43,16
I said go ahead but the neighbors
might not go for that. Anyway.


236
0:19:43,16 --> 0:19:49,22
I really came out of that one painted
red. This guy comes to Washington


237
0:19:49,22 --> 0:19:55,85
with a sense of humor. In doing
the most unbelievable mess of things


238
0:19:55,85 --> 0:19:59,46
and I was on the Environmental Public
Works Committee and all I came away


239
0:19:59,46 --> 0:20:4,27
from was admiration for a guy who
could take more flak by the ton


240
0:20:4,27 --> 0:20:10,53
and keep smiling with a great sense
of humor. And this young man


241
0:20:10,53 --> 0:20:14,76
was in the the he represented uh
a client who was being seriously


242
0:20:14,76 --> 0:20:20,67
abused by the Union Pacific Railroad.
 And Ed Herschler, a Democrat, and Hellbaum, and


243
0:20:20,67 --> 0:20:25,92
myself with the council of this young
lawyer took on the Union Pacific


244
0:20:25,92 --> 0:20:31,19
and smashed them flat. Don't forget
the statue books were set up so


245
0:20:31,19 --> 0:20:35,42
the Union Pacific could put a 
depot in your living room!


246
0:20:35,42 --> 0:20:40,46
Because they got twenty miles on each 
side of the track and inter lacking


247
0:20:40,46 --> 0:20:44,65
minerals and surface.  And they
were crowding out the Trona industry.


248
0:20:44,65 --> 0:20:52,66
So I'm always I dunno, I'm perverse.
 It's obvious that I am, but back


249
0:20:52,66 --> 0:20:59,45
to your question.  The president
wanted us as co-chairs, we went


250
0:20:59,45 --> 0:21:3,13
to see him which says everything
on the table, he says yes, everything,


251
0:21:3,13 --> 0:21:8,12
including your Obama-care, yep, he
took our commission in and told


252
0:21:8,12 --> 0:21:14,97
us the same thing. And uh we came
out after 8 months with 5 Democrats


253
0:21:14,97 --> 0:21:20,8
and 5 republicans and 1 independent
voting for a package which is tough.


254
0:21:20,8 --> 0:21:26,49
And real and it's about math.
 It's not about emotion. And senior


255
0:21:26,49 --> 0:21:30,63
citizens breaking the bed pans in
the hospices and cheating the veterans


256
0:21:30,63 --> 0:21:35,83
and all this junk that you get out
of em. And social security, how


257
0:21:35,83 --> 0:21:41,7
could you ever change retirement
age to 68 by the year 2050, how


258
0:21:41,7 --> 0:21:45,29
will seniors ever be able to, and
I said, you can figure it out somehow.


259
0:21:45,29 --> 0:21:50,7
Anyway. I'm getting a lot of trouble
that way and uh so for the first


260
0:21:50,7 --> 0:21:55,14
3 months we didn't even have any
trust. I was on the Iraq study


261
0:21:55,14 --> 0:21:59,22
group. There was no trust in the
beginning. That was Jim Baker and


262
0:21:59,22 --> 0:22:3,47
Lee Hamil. So finally Herst and
I said we'll just do a 2 person


263
0:22:3,47 --> 0:22:8,52
report, we don't care if you join
or not. Because the first all of


264
0:22:8,52 --> 0:22:11,48
this stuff, the first few months
they say, who is the biggest spending


265
0:22:11,48 --> 0:22:15,45
president in the history of the United
States before this one. The answer?


266
0:22:15,45 --> 0:22:20,49
George W. Bush. Never voted a single
spending billion six and a half years.


267
0:22:20,49 --> 0:22:23,52
So that would light up
the fire but then they'd say this


268
0:22:23,52 --> 0:22:29,96
guy has 3 times worse, car, stimulus,
I mean, 3 months, finally we said,


269
0:22:29,96 --> 0:22:35,36
we don't give a damn how we got here
it's what do we do now.  This trajectory


270
0:22:35,36 --> 0:22:40,81
of debt deficit interest is on the same
course as Portugal, Spain, Ireland all


271
0:22:40,81 --> 0:22:46,36
the rest except we are bigger.  So we
began to talk. If you can imagine


272
0:22:46,36 --> 0:22:51,49
there was a congresswoman named Jan
Shakowski, Illinois, man oh man


273
0:22:51,49 --> 0:22:58,36
I can tell you she's tough.  And
she just raised hell. But she we


274
0:22:58,36 --> 0:23:1,66
said, well, then what's your plan, she
said, I'll do one, I'll give you


275
0:23:1,66 --> 0:23:5,63
a plan. It wasn't something we accepted,
but, if you're going to be in the


276
0:23:5,63 --> 0:23:9,81
game you don't just sit and bitch.
 Put your plan on the table. Don't


277
0:23:9,81 --> 0:23:15,78
just sit and say, I compromise is
a four letter word. In fact, in


278
0:23:15,78 --> 0:23:20,62
fact the speaker said when I asked
him about compromise, he said, I


279
0:23:20,62 --> 0:23:24,36
don't know that word.  And McConnel
doesn't know that word, and Harry


280
0:23:24,36 --> 0:23:28,7
Reed doesn't know that word, and
Pelosi doesn't know that word.


281
0:23:28,7 --> 0:23:30,66
But it won't make any difference
when the markets pull the chain


282
0:23:30,66 --> 0:23:33,84
on us.  They don't give a damn who's
running the country, they just want


283
0:23:33,84 --> 0:23:38,1
their money.  They want more interest
for their money when they see a


284
0:23:38,1 --> 0:23:41,88
dysfunctional government.  So it's
sad to watch, it's more bitter than


285
0:23:41,88 --> 0:23:46,1
I've ever seen, breaks your heart,
Ted Kennedy and I used to work together


286
0:23:46,1 --> 0:23:51,0
on immigration and other issues,
uh I didn't care what he did or


287
0:23:51,0 --> 0:23:55,1
how he lived, but he never broke
his promise to me ever, and that's


288
0:23:55,1 --> 0:23:59,73
one tough guy.  Never broke his word
to me.  But we used to just scrap,


289
0:23:59,73 --> 0:24:6,73
knock each other out, it was fun, I 
loved it. Anyway it's uh, we're headed


290
0:24:6,73 --> 0:24:13,94
for deep stuff and and and uh I don't
see any prospect of any kind of


291
0:24:13,94 --> 0:24:17,74
cooperation before the election,
and between November 6 and December


292
0:24:17,74 --> 0:24:22,12
31 hang on to your shorts.  Cause
it's going to be a blood bath of


293
0:24:22,12 --> 0:24:27,58
5 to 7 trillion bucks rolling around.
 If you go too far one way it's


294
0:24:27,58 --> 0:24:31,29
a recession.  And if you do too little
it's a recession.  We'll see what


295
0:24:31,29 --> 0:24:35,26
happens.  But you've got to keep
your sense of humor.  I try to do


296
0:24:35,26 --> 0:24:39,95
that.  My mother said that humor
is the universal solvent against


297
0:24:39,95 --> 0:24:45,65
the abrasive elements of life.  The
other one is the definition of politics,


298
0:24:45,65 --> 0:24:50,41
and here it is, very short: in politics
there are no right answers, only


299
0:24:50,41 --> 0:24:56,42
a continual flow of compromises among
groups resulting in a changing cloudy


300
0:24:56,42 --> 0:25:2,2
and ambiguous series of public decisions,
where appetite and ambition compete


301
0:25:2,2 --> 0:25:8,65
openly with knowledge and wisdom.
[Laughter]


302
0:25:8,65 --> 0:25:12,63
Tears are streaming down your cheeks!
[Laughter]


303
0:25:12,63 --> 0:25:14,53
Male Speaker
That's too profound for me! [Laughter]


304
0:25:14,53 --> 0:25:22,3
Mike Sullivan
Let me just ask John. Uh you were


305
0:25:22,3 --> 0:25:27,61
you were director of fish and wildlife
 during uh spotted owl and reintroduction


306
0:25:27,61 --> 0:25:33,48
of the wolf and a number of other issues 
that you can remember better than I can.


307
0:25:33,48 --> 0:25:38,26
Uh where do you think the collaborative
 process comes in and what issues


308
0:25:38,26 --> 0:25:40,85
does it particularly lend itself to?


309
0:25:40,85 --> 0:25:44,23
John Turner
well thank you mike, and uh what


310
0:25:44,23 --> 0:25:48,84
a pleasure to join you all.  These,
literally, 3 giants up here, and


311
0:25:48,84 --> 0:25:52,68
I want to thank you all for joining
us today, taking part of your time


312
0:25:52,68 --> 0:25:57,47
uh I'm really proud as hopefully
all of you who live in Wyoming with


313
0:25:57,47 --> 0:26:2,27
what's going on in Laramie uh these
days.  Dr. Burke and her staff,


314
0:26:2,27 --> 0:26:8,87
uh the University of Wyoming is really
a great university in many respects


315
0:26:8,87 --> 0:26:13,32
and one of them is in  the arena
of natural resources. Uh thanks


316
0:26:13,32 --> 0:26:16,23
to the gentlemen here and many others
what's going on in the Ruckelshaus


317
0:26:16,23 --> 0:26:21,56
Institute is uh really an example
of excellence for the mountain west


318
0:26:21,56 --> 0:26:25,86
and for the for entire country how
we can come together and build information,


319
0:26:25,86 --> 0:26:31,46
find common ground, solutions to
some pretty thorny issues.  Uh a


320
0:26:31,46 --> 0:26:35,49
superb school of natural resources,
a wonderful conservation corps working


321
0:26:35,49 --> 0:26:41,4
across the state, and now uh uh the
Barry Center on uh Biodiversity


322
0:26:41,4 --> 0:26:47,25
just has great promise for Wyoming
and the future of the West.  Uh.


323
0:26:47,25 --> 0:26:54,35
President Bush honored me by asking
me to join the US Fish and Wildlife


324
0:26:54,35 --> 0:27:1,92
Service uh in 1990.  And uh that
was literally the best job in Washington.


325
0:27:1,92 --> 0:27:6,25
But I was, uh, a foot taller and a head
of hair I think that's I think that's


326
0:27:6,25 --> 0:27:10,5
a Simpson Simpsonite.  But before
I got into the Fish and Wildlife


327
0:27:10,5 --> 0:27:15,49
Service mostly because of endangered
species and uh the wetlands and


328
0:27:15,49 --> 0:27:20,89
a few others, I can recall uh going
to Shirley Basin to reintroduce


329
0:27:20,89 --> 0:27:25,24
uh the black footed ferret which
Jack they found here in Meeteetse,


330
0:27:25,24 --> 0:27:30,74
uh the rarest mammal in the world,
we were down to 18 animals and decided


331
0:27:30,74 --> 0:27:34,57
to roll the dice and look for a place
for re-introduction in the Shirley


332
0:27:34,57 --> 0:27:41,46
Basin and the ranchers there on private
land agreed to work with us to allow


333
0:27:41,46 --> 0:27:48,4
us to reintroduce uh the black footed
ferret. Um and I asked one of


334
0:27:48,4 --> 0:27:51,32
the ranchers, I remember we were
up there to release the first ferrets,


335
0:27:51,32 --> 0:27:55,39
pickups going everywhere, and private
leaving gates open and dust and


336
0:27:55,39 --> 0:27:58,54
biologists setting up all kinds of
crap and I said, why are you letting


337
0:27:58,54 --> 0:28:3,94
us do this?  Here is the most rarest
and endangered mammal on the planet


338
0:28:3,94 --> 0:28:7,38
and you're allowing us to put it
right in the middle of your operation.


339
0:28:7,38 --> 0:28:11,47
He said, well gosh, it's a part
of Wyoming landscape and it's kind


340
0:28:11,47 --> 0:28:15,14
of exciting just don't tell our friends
at the Wyoming stock growers we're


341
0:28:15,14 --> 0:28:22,55
doing this cause of the spotted owl,
the wolf reintroduction, uh I might


342
0:28:22,55 --> 0:28:27,58
make a few comments on wolf reintroduction
because Al's here and his memory's


343
0:28:27,58 --> 0:28:33,71
pretty ripe on this one.  Uh wolf reintroduction
was a national uh interest of course


344
0:28:33,71 --> 0:28:39,41
for decades uh to bring wolves back
to Yellowstone landscape and uh


345
0:28:39,41 --> 0:28:43,1
myself and a few others had the audacity
to think we could come up with a


346
0:28:43,1 --> 0:28:46,48
plan which would meet the interests
of the western states, the cattlemen,


347
0:28:46,48 --> 0:28:51,99
the sportsmen, as well as the national
interest and so working with Alan and


348
0:28:51,99 --> 0:28:56,42
I'm sure he regrets to this day and
Malcolm Wall and Conrad Burns and


349
0:28:56,42 --> 0:29:5,71
Jim McClure, Larry Craig some pretty tough 
hombres, we made, we put together a group, call it


350
0:29:5,71 --> 0:29:9,67
a collaborative effort.  Uh we had
ranchers, we had wool growers, we


351
0:29:9,67 --> 0:29:16,44
had uh, local officials, we had people
from game and fish agencies in a


352
0:29:16,44 --> 0:29:22,63
three state region, we had conservationists,
wildlife groups, and we put together


353
0:29:22,63 --> 0:29:28,9
a a pledge, a plan and a pledge,
to Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho that


354
0:29:28,9 --> 0:29:33,8
we would reintroduce the wolves,
which we did, 31 of them into Yellowstone


355
0:29:33,8 --> 0:29:37,63
Park.  Uh and also some in Idaho.
 We made the pledge uh at the threshold


356
0:29:37,63 --> 0:29:42,98
would be 10 breeding pair in each
state.  Uh 10 breeding units in


357
0:29:42,98 --> 0:29:48,64
Idaho, Montana.  And once that happened,
then we would turn jurisdiction back


358
0:29:48,64 --> 0:29:54,68
to the states.  Uh and that we would
make a compact with the ranchers


359
0:29:54,68 --> 0:29:59,35
and the livestock owners the big
game interests that when wolves


360
0:29:59,35 --> 0:30:5,14
misbehaved they would be managed
but they would be off limits and


361
0:30:5,14 --> 0:30:11,99
I uh so it was this successful collaborative
effort where the western congressional


362
0:30:11,99 --> 0:30:17,2
delegations were not happy about
this.  But it sounds like as good


363
0:30:17,2 --> 0:30:20,54
a deal as fair a deal for the western
states and the national interest.


364
0:30:20,54 --> 0:30:25,44
And I regret to this day we have
never kept the promise to the people


365
0:30:25,44 --> 0:30:30,35
of Wyoming and Idaho and Utah.
 Uh it's great to have wolves back


366
0:30:30,35 --> 0:30:34,65
as part of this landscape but by
Wyoming law we have almost 30 breeding


367
0:30:34,65 --> 0:30:40,41
pair now and 3 times the promise
pacts I think were close to 50 pacts,


368
0:30:40,41 --> 0:30:45,73
in Wyoming uh a lot of people don't 
want to recognize that government agents


369
0:30:45,73 --> 0:30:51,0
have killed 1700 wolves since they
were introduced. Why should the


370
0:30:51,0 --> 0:30:56,37
tax payers be these conscientious
agents trying to take of problem wolves.


371
0:30:56,37 --> 0:31:1,6
So unfortunately, the people that
bought into that collaborative effort


372
0:31:1,6 --> 0:31:6,71
to get it done was successful but
the final outcome where we had I'm


373
0:31:6,71 --> 0:31:10,98
sure well intended but misguided
activists and activist judges which keep moving


374
0:31:10,98 --> 0:31:18,87
moving the goal post and uh certain
groups that want to litigate and


375
0:31:18,87 --> 0:31:23,23
so forth.  But I think uh the US
Fish and Wildlife Service tried


376
0:31:23,23 --> 0:31:28,48
to down this wolf since 2002 and
of course that's been for the


377
0:31:28,48 --> 0:31:34,66
court and we'll try again this fall
with a compromise that uh the federal


378
0:31:34,66 --> 0:31:40,22
government, Governor Mead, and others have
tried to put together, uh I think


379
0:31:40,22 --> 0:31:46,46
there's already been court filings
uh there already been court filings


380
0:31:46,46 --> 0:31:50,33
before Fish and Wildlife interiors
even publish the rules for this


381
0:31:50,33 --> 0:31:54,74
fall.  But it's unfortunate we did
not keep our pledge to the West


382
0:31:54,74 --> 0:32:1,19
uh to the western states.  The people,
I got off a plane about a few years


383
0:32:1,19 --> 0:32:6,83
ago, here in Cody.  Ran into a very prominent
lady I won't use here name, I promise


384
0:32:6,83 --> 0:32:10,32
a very intelligent businesswoman
I've been friends with, saw her


385
0:32:10,32 --> 0:32:14,67
in the airport, went to give her
a hug, she just shaken me she backed


386
0:32:14,67 --> 0:32:18,42
away from me, and she said, John,
I can never forgive you for what


387
0:32:18,42 --> 0:32:23,45
you did. I said, What? What are we talking
about, she says, your intr -  reintroduction


388
0:32:23,45 --> 0:32:28,73
of wolves into Yellowstone. I love 
Yellowstone park. I go there every


389
0:32:28,73 --> 0:32:33,33
year with my kids and my grandkids
I can never go back to Yellowstone


390
0:32:33,33 --> 0:32:37,19
because of what you've done.  Now
you can say, well that's a little


391
0:32:37,19 --> 0:32:41,64
unreal, but people around the country,
you all do understand the passion


392
0:32:41,64 --> 0:32:47,44
with wolves. The years in the
legislature, I saw a grown man stand


393
0:32:47,44 --> 0:32:52,84
up and break into tears on 2 issues
of my 19 year one of course is abortion


394
0:32:52,84 --> 0:33:0,72
the other was wolves.  So we're
not there yet on wolves, and, um, I'm


395
0:33:0,72 --> 0:33:2,96
sure Alan would have quite a few
comments on them.  Northern spotted


396
0:33:2,96 --> 0:33:7,81
owl probably biggest endangered species
issue facing the country.  Prior


397
0:33:7,81 --> 0:33:14,51
was salmon, uh, Pacific salmon, involved
3 states, uh about 12 million acres,


398
0:33:14,51 --> 0:33:18,88
we established critical habitat on
7 million.  The entire northwest


399
0:33:18,88 --> 0:33:22,66
was fearful, people's jobs, just
wanted to pay off their mortgage,


400
0:33:22,66 --> 0:33:28,3
send their kids to school, uh I think
we found good middle ground uh on


401
0:33:28,3 --> 0:33:36,37
science uh to try to help communities
for the unemployment issues, but


402
0:33:36,37 --> 0:33:40,8
spotted owls was another tough one.  We
did that have a lot of collaborative


403
0:33:40,8 --> 0:33:48,64
efforts, timber companies, communities, 
and uh the three states.


404
0:33:48,64 --> 0:33:51,29
Mike Sullivan
What what kind of natural resource issues


405
0:33:51,29 --> 0:33:56,58
in the West are not suitable 
for the collaborative process?


406
0:33:56,58 --> 0:34:0,6
Bill Ruckelshaus
It's an important, uh uh, thank


407
0:34:0,6 --> 0:34:2,79
you Mike for asking that because
that's an important thing to remember.


408
0:34:2,79 --> 0:34:8,42
All issues can't be solved by a
collaborative process.  They're


409
0:34:8,42 --> 0:34:14,36
not suited for it.  Uh but and all issues
that for which collaborative processes


410
0:34:14,36 --> 0:34:19,68
are suited aren't always solved
that way because all these processes


411
0:34:19,68 --> 0:34:24,32
don't work.  Sometimes people don't
participate in them and they don't


412
0:34:24,32 --> 0:34:26,75
really participate in good faith.
 They want to blow them up and if


413
0:34:26,75 --> 0:34:30,68
somebody's determined to that you
can usually blow them.  But the


414
0:34:30,68 --> 0:34:35,95
the best way from my standpoint to
think about it, areas in which these


415
0:34:35,95 --> 0:34:40,86
collaborative processes work well
are sort of place based uh issues.


416
0:34:40,86 --> 0:34:44,6
And they that sort of defines a
lot of natural resource problems.


417
0:34:44,6 --> 0:34:50,47
Uh, for instance in a watershed
you have a lot of different claimants


418
0:34:50,47 --> 0:34:55,34
for the use of water.  Uh ranging
from wildlife habitat, to fish habitat,


419
0:34:55,34 --> 0:35:4,18
to irrigation, to uh recreation.  Uh
drinking water supply, the conditions


420
0:35:4,18 --> 0:35:9,91
of water quality.  Those issues can
provide people and just proper water


421
0:35:9,91 --> 0:35:14,37
rights that are so well known in
the West, as very emotional issues.


422
0:35:14,37 --> 0:35:20,42
Those kinds of water related and
watershed place based kind of problems,


423
0:35:20,42 --> 0:35:24,42
if you get everybody at the table
and open their minds and get them willing


424
0:35:24,42 --> 0:35:28,94
to talk to one another it's amazing
how much progress can be made.


425
0:35:28,94 --> 0:35:34,48
We have an situation in Puget Sound,
where I now live, and uh a watershed,


426
0:35:34,48 --> 0:35:40,61
and there just huge fights over salmon,
which are listed as endangered in


427
0:35:40,61 --> 0:35:45,31
Puget Sound, and which, so it is
a problem of habitat, where those


428
0:35:45,31 --> 0:35:52,73
fish normally would spawn and breed
and where this uh smolts would uh would originate.


429
0:35:52,73 --> 0:35:59,22
There are huge fights over these
questions.  And there are 14 major


430
0:35:59,22 --> 0:36:4,41
watersheds in Puget Sound.  In
3 of them there have been collaborative


431
0:36:4,41 --> 0:36:8,51
processes, one of which has gone
over 20 years, where the people


432
0:36:8,51 --> 0:36:12,2
are all together.  They have managed
to sit down and talk through all


433
0:36:12,2 --> 0:36:16,4
their desires for the uses of the
water in that sound.  That's where


434
0:36:16,4 --> 0:36:19,79
Mountaineer is located, Ft. Lewis
is there, there are a lot of small


435
0:36:19,79 --> 0:36:24,32
towns, there is an Indian reservation
on the edge of the Squalee River,


436
0:36:24,32 --> 0:36:28,89
that's the river where this uh collaborative
process has been working.  All of


437
0:36:28,89 --> 0:36:34,41
these people have worked out their
their their interests and have managed


438
0:36:34,41 --> 0:36:38,76
to harmonize them.  And they got
more money, and this may not make


439
0:36:38,76 --> 0:36:42,6
everybody in Wyoming happy, but they
got more money in the stimulus program


440
0:36:42,6 --> 0:36:45,39
than all the rest of the watersheds
in Puget Sound put together.


441
0:36:45,39 --> 0:36:49,59
For 2 reasons: they had a plan that
they all agreed to, and they all


442
0:36:49,59 --> 0:36:53,98
went forward and tried to raise money
on it uh from first the federal


443
0:36:53,98 --> 0:36:57,39
government and anyplace else they
could find it.  They have made enormous


444
0:36:57,39 --> 0:37:2,48
progress in that watershed. They have, they've
worked out all their problems themselves


445
0:37:2,48 --> 0:37:6,75
and they all think of the watershed
as their place.  That's where they


446
0:37:6,75 --> 0:37:12,8
live and that's where their children
are going to grow up, and uh


447
0:37:12,8 --> 0:37:17,42
they they find it enormously uh rewarding
that they have been able to come


448
0:37:17,42 --> 0:37:22,66
together. And it's primarily because
a farmer who was a leading citizen


449
0:37:22,66 --> 0:37:26,73
in the watershed and an Indian chief
named Billy Frank shook hands and


450
0:37:26,73 --> 0:37:30,9
said, we've got to stop fighting and 
stop going to court stop going to the


451
0:37:30,9 --> 0:37:34,57
legislature trying to get our way and figure 
out how to harmonize our interest and they've


452
0:37:34,57 --> 0:37:38,95
done it.  It is it's a marvelous place
to visit because you know almost the


453
0:37:38,95 --> 0:37:42,43
minute you come into that watershed
the people there are all on the same page


454
0:37:42,43 --> 0:37:45,17
pulling in the same direction.


455
0:37:45,17 --> 0:37:49,6
John Turner
it, it isn't going to work if the


456
0:37:49,6 --> 0:37:53,34
key players won't sit at the table.
 They figure there's uh either they


457
0:37:53,34 --> 0:37:59,8
can force something that they want important
in their own means or the objectives


458
0:37:59,8 --> 0:38:4,68
they think they can get in an arena
 Or I think there are some issues


459
0:38:4,68 --> 0:38:8,43
that are over ripe.  They've been
worked so much and people have beaten


460
0:38:8,43 --> 0:38:11,34
the tar out of each other so long and 
it's been in the papers so long that


461
0:38:11,34 --> 0:38:16,26
that trying to find common 
ground might be difficult.


462
0:38:16,26 --> 0:38:19,58
Alan Simpson
 My, in my, I think I'm correct that


463
0:38:19,58 --> 0:38:25,24
Montana has not yet done a wilderness
bill nor Idaho?  But Wyoming did.


464
0:38:25,24 --> 0:38:28,65
And Herschler was governor. 
 Malcom and I and Dick Cheney


465
0:38:28,65 --> 0:38:34,59
were in the house and in the 
Senate and and John Cyberling


466
0:38:34,59 --> 0:38:38,83
was the chair of the house committee
and he wanted to put he had a staff


467
0:38:38,83 --> 0:38:44,16
member who wanted to rise every morning
at uh face east and transform himself


468
0:38:44,16 --> 0:38:48,21
into some kind of Zeus or something.
 I never did figure out what the


469
0:38:48,21 --> 0:38:51,5
hell the guy was doing, but he wanted
to set the whole state of Wyoming


470
0:38:51,5 --> 0:38:55,7
into wilderness.  So we put a bill
to make a city park in Cleveland


471
0:38:55,7 --> 0:39:1,3
a wilderness, and Cyberling then
came over to visit and we began


472
0:39:1,3 --> 0:39:8,0
to talk.  And then the enviros came
and and there was never enough but


473
0:39:8,0 --> 0:39:13,12
we need another 285 thousand acres,
or we need an so finally Malcom


474
0:39:13,12 --> 0:39:18,19
and I and Herschler and Dick got a
big map and we said, bring us


475
0:39:18,19 --> 0:39:24,61
a Crayola.  A big 'ol black Crayola.
 And we said, how many more acres


476
0:39:24,61 --> 0:39:28,49
you want? I mean cause you're not getting
out of this room and playing this


477
0:39:28,49 --> 0:39:31,58
game where you get it and then you
go and give it again and then you


478
0:39:31,58 --> 0:39:37,6
go to court. So they said well we 
need a hundred and whatever it was


479
0:39:37,6 --> 0:39:40,0
so Herschler looked at it is said,
well we need something down there


480
0:39:40,0 --> 0:39:43,7
in the southwest down there 
around Fontanel he drew a


481
0:39:43,7 --> 0:39:44,99
little picture and had acres in it.


482
0:39:44,99 --> 0:39:49,68
Cheney said, well back there behind
Hogadon, we like that up there.


483
0:39:49,68 --> 0:39:52,34
That would look good up there.  
Malcolm said, oh I've been waiting


484
0:39:52,34 --> 0:39:55,39
for that around Cloud Peak, 
we'll just, hell I said, well


485
0:39:55,39 --> 0:39:59,99
Bob Cat Crick we'll just run something
back over the ridge there.  And


486
0:39:59,99 --> 0:40:5,0
we did and they said, well, they,
and we said, well isn't they the


487
0:40:5,0 --> 0:40:7,8
acreage you wanted, they says, well
yeah, but we have to talk to our


488
0:40:7,8 --> 0:40:11,22
people.  We said, no.  This is it.
 You've been hanging around like


489
0:40:11,22 --> 0:40:16,38
poor relatives and now that's it.
 [Laughter.]  And so we sent it up


490
0:40:16,38 --> 0:40:22,14
to the President and I to show how
retractable it is, I believe if


491
0:40:22,14 --> 0:40:27,92
I'm not mistaken that Steve Sims
and and Church even tried to do


492
0:40:27,92 --> 0:40:32,23
it.  Conrad and Locke has tried to
do it.  In other words, efforts


493
0:40:32,23 --> 0:40:37,73
between Democrats and Republicans
always cremated by these ropes that


494
0:40:37,73 --> 0:40:41,63
are demanding more and more and more.
It's unbelievable. So I think I'm correct


495
0:40:41,63 --> 0:40:45,15
maybe somebody can correct me 
but I don't think either of


496
0:40:45,15 --> 0:40:51,45
those two states, and don't forget
 Wyoming leaving off Alaska, the lower 48,


497
0:40:51,45 --> 0:40:57,42
Wyoming provides 44% of the nation's
wilderness.  It's like I said we


498
0:40:57,42 --> 0:41:2,53
gave at the office.  [Laughter]


499
0:41:2,53 --> 0:41:5,42
Mike Sullivan
Well, what a day, I think


500
0:41:5,42 --> 0:41:9,24
what you're saying is that there
are issues where because of the


501
0:41:9,24 --> 0:41:14,17
demands of one group or another you
can never reach the harmony that


502
0:41:14,17 --> 0:41:19,17
Bill talks about.  One of the one
of the questions that occurred to


503
0:41:19,17 --> 0:41:24,94
me today was, and I think it may
be why we can't go anywhere on health


504
0:41:24,94 --> 0:41:30,55
care, nat- nationwide with regard
to the parameters yes or no politics


505
0:41:30,55 --> 0:41:36,65
on that but, has it been your experience
that when you have an issue that


506
0:41:36,65 --> 0:41:41,29
there is a large group that
 wants the status quo?


507
0:41:41,29 --> 0:41:44,75
Bill Ruckelshaus
They're they're not going to negotiate


508
0:41:44,75 --> 0:41:50,87
good faith, one of the things you have 
to do before you, Alan Alan's decision


509
0:41:50,87 --> 0:41:58,28
is an example of place based. Example except 
pl- space was unlimited.  That's no definition


510
0:41:58,28 --> 0:42:1,85
of the space. There's no watershed.
 No place that they could identify


511
0:42:1,85 --> 0:42:8,3
with as their place.  And and so
it is important to be able to put


512
0:42:8,3 --> 0:42:12,32
some boundaries on what they uh what
was they're discussing in order


513
0:42:12,32 --> 0:42:18,2
for these collaborative processes
to work.  Uh and you I I have believed


514
0:42:18,2 --> 0:42:22,7
for years, in fact we suggested this
to the congress on environmental


515
0:42:22,7 --> 0:42:28,46
issues, that they should try to get
the before introducing a bill a


516
0:42:28,46 --> 0:42:31,58
member of the committee should try
to get the relevant players around


517
0:42:31,58 --> 0:42:34,41
the table and say, okay, we're going
to work this out, much the way Alan


518
0:42:34,41 --> 0:42:37,95
just described in the wilderness
situation.  And here the criteria


519
0:42:37,95 --> 0:42:41,14
we are going to use is we need an
agreement and if we don't get an


520
0:42:41,14 --> 0:42:45,76
agreement out of all of you it will
be balance because of the balanced group we are


521
0:42:45,76 --> 0:42:49,36
going to go ahead anyway.  So it
forces a decision for a certain period


522
0:42:49,36 --> 0:42:55,45
of time it is a form of collaborative
process.  There's more force associated


523
0:42:55,45 --> 0:43:3,35
with it.  It won't change the decision
of the process itself is normal but if you


524
0:43:3,35 --> 0:43:6,99
don't have everybody collaborating
and somebody says the status quo


525
0:43:6,99 --> 0:43:11,46
is fine they're not a player.  Before
you start one of these processes,


526
0:43:11,46 --> 0:43:15,18
what you have to do whether it is
a university Wyoming or Washington


527
0:43:15,18 --> 0:43:17,78
or any other university or place
where this is going to happen.


528
0:43:17,78 --> 0:43:21,4
You have to do an assessment.  You
have to go out and talk to all of


529
0:43:21,4 --> 0:43:24,0
the people that are going to be involved
and say, are you going to play?


530
0:43:24,0 --> 0:43:28,96
Are you willing to try best you
can to harmonize your interests


531
0:43:28,96 --> 0:43:32,6
with that of others at the table?
 And if they say, no, I can get


532
0:43:32,6 --> 0:43:35,36
a better deal in the legislature
or the courts or the status quo


533
0:43:35,36 --> 0:43:41,18
is fine with me, then you don't have
a a a requisite agreement to try


534
0:43:41,18 --> 0:43:43,79
to work things out with a proper group.


535
0:43:43,79 --> 0:43:46,5
Alan Simpson
  Think of it this way.


536
0:43:46,5 --> 0:43:51,98
You've got uh the situation, now,
83 guys in the house, and gals,


537
0:43:51,98 --> 0:43:56,55
they didn't go there to limit government,
they went there to stop government.


538
0:43:56,55 --> 0:44:2,4
Well how the hell do you start anything
when you've got 83 people rock bound


539
0:44:2,4 --> 0:44:6,84
that want to stop government? 
 Merry Christmas! [Laughter]


540
0:44:6,84 --> 0:44:11,66
Mike Sulivan
John?


541
0:44:11,66 --> 0:44:14,43
John Turner
I think the uh idea of rightness


542
0:44:14,43 --> 0:44:19,49
is is there is some merit to it.
 I recall in the legislature Alan


543
0:44:19,49 --> 0:44:26,4
mentioned the open space easement gives land
 owners another tool at auction where their property


544
0:44:26,4 --> 0:44:31,57
rights uh when we put that in it was the
agriculture interest, a few others


545
0:44:31,57 --> 0:44:35,72
that helped do us in.  Then we came
up with an idea called the Wildlife


546
0:44:35,72 --> 0:44:40,66
Trust Fund that uh the two of you remember
where were going to take mineral


547
0:44:40,66 --> 0:44:46,7
proceeds create a 5 to 250 million
dollars to compensate Wyoming ranchers to


548
0:44:46,7 --> 0:44:51,6
uh to keep the land private property
but uh to provide easements. Again


549
0:44:51,6 --> 0:44:54,8
it was the Ag interests and 
we've talked a lot about it


550
0:44:54,8 --> 0:44:58,4
recently with some of their leaders
about how they helped throughout


551
0:44:58,4 --> 0:45:2,78
that and we lost it by one vote in
two sessions.  Wyoming in my opinion


552
0:45:2,78 --> 0:45:7,49
has an opportunity that no other
state has to protect its wildlife,


553
0:45:7,49 --> 0:45:12,37
resources, its open space, its critical
watersheds, its tradition of agriculture


554
0:45:12,37 --> 0:45:15,66
in a way that no other state can
cause both states have screwed it


555
0:45:15,66 --> 0:45:19,95
up and lost it and they're spending
billions to protect remnants where


556
0:45:19,95 --> 0:45:24,69
Wyoming can really mold their landscapes
and partnership with the land owners.


557
0:45:24,69 --> 0:45:30,3
Well now that has all changed uh
the Wyoming land owners all over


558
0:45:30,3 --> 0:45:35,2
the state are forming partnerships
with nonprofit groups, with the


559
0:45:35,2 --> 0:45:41,75
Wyoming trust fund which is now in
place, the NRCS, the University


560
0:45:41,75 --> 0:45:46,38
of Wyoming, it has provided data
and background, and I think that


561
0:45:46,38 --> 0:45:52,4
Wyoming stockholder's agriculture land 
trust is now protected 170,000 acres across


562
0:45:52,4 --> 0:45:56,51
Wyoming on a volunteer basis. They're
now the 9th largest land trust in


563
0:45:56,51 --> 0:46:1,76
the United States there are 1700
of them, uh, just down here in Meeteetsee


564
0:46:1,76 --> 0:46:8,5
the uh Epperson family at the Hat
Two Ranch protected a huge 13,000


565
0:46:8,5 --> 0:46:14,67
uh acre easement provided aquidity.
Cash for future generation to help


566
0:46:14,67 --> 0:46:17,46
that family to help keep ranching
down at the Butt Ranch down in Sublette


567
0:46:17,46 --> 0:46:22,95
County.  We just did a wonderful
uh uh conservation easement deal


568
0:46:22,95 --> 0:46:25,98
where they're going to buy the ranch
use the proceeds to buy the ranch


569
0:46:25,98 --> 0:46:32,74
next to them keep both protected and uh
provide easements to help sage grouse,


570
0:46:32,74 --> 0:46:38,24
winter mule deer habitat, moose habitat,
so what's going on with the Wyoming


571
0:46:38,24 --> 0:46:44,55
land owners now?  Using good signs
for priority areas uh people bringing


572
0:46:44,55 --> 0:46:48,76
their resources together part of
the mineral industry has been willing


573
0:46:48,76 --> 0:46:54,59
to put up money to impact to to mitigate
impact in the upper Green.  So the


574
0:46:54,59 --> 0:47:0,77
collaborative effort now is is really
working well.  Uh and we have an


575
0:47:0,77 --> 0:47:4,63
opportunity to do a lot more because
I think now the timeliness is right


576
0:47:4,63 --> 0:47:10,5
where Wyoming ranchers see uh an
opportunity to keep lands in private


577
0:47:10,5 --> 0:47:15,9
ownership to keep ranching protect
public value. uh resources, so


578
0:47:15,9 --> 0:47:19,68
there's great opportunity for Wyoming
based on this kind of collaborative effort


579
0:47:19,68 --> 0:47:22,8



580
0:47:22,8 --> 0:47:24,83
Mike Sullivan
And so many of these issues where there


581
0:47:24,83 --> 0:47:31,63
isn't that self-interest and harmony from 
the beginning, you need to have some kind


582
0:47:31,63 --> 0:47:38,9
of a hammer that provides that self 
interest.  And it seems to me in many cases


583
0:47:38,9 --> 0:47:43,53
that's leadership.  Whether it's
the Senate committee that says,


584
0:47:43,53 --> 0:47:47,36
we're going to do something.  We
prefer you do it collaboratively,


585
0:47:47,36 --> 0:47:51,94
but if you don't do it we're going
to do it.  Or a governor who says,


586
0:47:51,94 --> 0:47:57,53
this is an issue and we're going
to take care of it.  But as we see


587
0:47:57,53 --> 0:48:4,4
in today's political world, so many
of the leaders, as Al mentioned,


588
0:48:4,4 --> 0:48:12,84
and as we see the elections coming
up even, uh the executive uh nominees,


589
0:48:12,84 --> 0:48:20,53
are going to come in with an unwillingness
to talk about compromise.  Or collaboration.


590
0:48:20,53 --> 0:48:27,23
How do you get the leadership into
a collaborative attitude in order


591
0:48:27,23 --> 0:48:32,51
to move some of these intractable
issues off the status quo or off


592
0:48:32,51 --> 0:48:37,91
of the self-interest issues and
into an area where you can have


593
0:48:37,91 --> 0:48:43,6
some kind of harmonization of the interests?


594
0:48:43,6 --> 0:48:47,56
Bill Ruckelshaus
If I could answer that question


595
0:48:47,56 --> 0:48:49,45
we wouldn't need to have
 a presidential election.


596
0:48:49,45 --> 0:48:56,78
How do you get leaders to be leaders?
 If leadership is defined as no


597
0:48:56,78 --> 0:49:2,23
give, no compromise, no backing away
from the principle, we ought to


598
0:49:2,23 --> 0:49:5,83
have principles that guide our conduct
but principles don't say you can


599
0:49:5,83 --> 0:49:10,78
never compromise in order to achieve
a greater approximation toward whatever


600
0:49:10,78 --> 0:49:14,1
principle you're trying to preserve.
 It may be necessary to compromise


601
0:49:14,1 --> 0:49:18,73
to get there.  And it is clearly
true when these collaborative processes


602
0:49:18,73 --> 0:49:22,84
work it is because leaders in the
various among the various interest


603
0:49:22,84 --> 0:49:27,5
groups that are being represented
at the table come forward and exercise


604
0:49:27,5 --> 0:49:31,3
leadership.  One of the things they
have to do is go back and talk to


605
0:49:31,3 --> 0:49:34,82
the people.  If they're representing
an environmental group, or ranchers,


606
0:49:34,82 --> 0:49:40,3
or whoever it is that that is part
of their uh contingent, they can't


607
0:49:40,3 --> 0:49:43,21
just go in there and represent themselves.
 They have to go in there and talk


608
0:49:43,21 --> 0:49:47,1
to their groups and say, here's where
we are, what do you think?  And


609
0:49:47,1 --> 0:49:51,77
then exercise some persuasiveness
and leadership among their own group


610
0:49:51,77 --> 0:49:56,28
to get them to move forward toward
a compromise that will give most


611
0:49:56,28 --> 0:50:0,56
people most of what they want.  If
somebody comes out with everything


612
0:50:0,56 --> 0:50:4,13
they want then probably somebody
else got nothing.  So you're going


613
0:50:4,13 --> 0:50:8,72
to need to have a willingness to
compromise when those groups come


614
0:50:8,72 --> 0:50:13,0
together.  But those leaders have
to usually emerge during the discussion


615
0:50:13,0 --> 0:50:17,1
of the collaboration itself.  And
it's not somebody running for presidential


616
0:50:17,1 --> 0:50:21,6
office it's somebody who is very
unlikely.  They just happened to


617
0:50:21,6 --> 0:50:26,2
be someone with an interest that
uh they have been imaginative enough


618
0:50:26,2 --> 0:50:29,12
to figure out how they can harmonize
with somebody else's interest.


619
0:50:29,12 --> 0:50:36,0
Alan Simpson
I think a a remarkable thing
is the existence of this thing for


620
0:50:36,0 --> 0:50:43,92
18 years.  Uh there were people of
all stripes who were terribly terribly


621
0:50:43,92 --> 0:50:49,24
concerned about hearing about this
operation starting up.  You remember


622
0:50:49,24 --> 0:50:54,83
that?  I do.  Big time.  Well, and
it came from, it, I wouldn't even


623
0:50:54,83 --> 0:50:59,36
name one, all of them were concerned,
what are they going to do uh they're


624
0:50:59,36 --> 0:51:2,65
going to mess around and uh they're
going to get into land use again


625
0:51:2,65 --> 0:51:5,29
and they're going to get into this
and this and water use and all the


626
0:51:5,29 --> 0:51:12,22
things that create high high passion
in Wyoming.  So bad that a member


627
0:51:12,22 --> 0:51:17,87
of I think they had an oversight
outfit in the legislature, our budget


628
0:51:17,87 --> 0:51:22,9
was 5 million bucks out of you know,
I don't know what the hell it was,


629
0:51:22,9 --> 0:51:27,8
a billion and a half or whatever,
and wanted an investigation of this


630
0:51:27,8 --> 0:51:32,5
group and put it in the law.  Now
that's how fun and games this was


631
0:51:32,5 --> 0:51:36,51
when it started.  It's been there
for 18 years.  Let me tell you.


632
0:51:36,51 --> 0:51:42,16
I dealt with people like Robert
Birds, George Mitchell, Al Cranston,


633
0:51:42,16 --> 0:51:46,57
Democrats of the first order, and
George Mitchell, you remember, Bill,


634
0:51:46,57 --> 0:51:50,92
put us all in a room, Democrats and
Republicans, and he said, we're


635
0:51:50,92 --> 0:51:54,41
going to do a clean air act.  And
we're going to do that, we have


636
0:51:54,41 --> 0:52:0,82
a conference and he brought in everybody
one after the other.  What great


637
0:52:0,82 --> 0:52:4,51
patience, it takes tremendous patience,
I do not have that.  I never have


638
0:52:4,51 --> 0:52:8,66
had.  I'll eventually get my foot
in it without question but I'll


639
0:52:8,66 --> 0:52:13,38
stick around.  I've never given anybody
the ice treatment.  That's the worse


640
0:52:13,38 --> 0:52:17,16
thing of all time.  You give the
other side the ice treatment, I'm


641
0:52:17,16 --> 0:52:21,37
not talking to you, it's a good way
to destroy marriages, it's a good


642
0:52:21,37 --> 0:52:25,21
way to destroy anything, destroy
nations, I used to say to Cheney,


643
0:52:25,21 --> 0:52:28,55
why the hell don't you talk to North
Korea and Iran?  Well we don't talk


644
0:52:28,55 --> 0:52:32,85
to Iran.  Well I says we won't have
anybody left!  [Laughter]


645
0:52:32,85 --> 0:52:36,41
And then Dick is a chum of the ages.
 He's just one of the dearest guys


646
0:52:36,41 --> 0:52:41,16
I have.  Of course they then chose
the demonize him, sadly enough,


647
0:52:41,16 --> 0:52:45,65
cause he's just he's just he's right.
 And that's my personal opinion.


648
0:52:45,65 --> 0:52:53,93
But.  Never the less.  Madness.
 To see to see the uh uh uh came


649
0:52:53,93 --> 0:52:59,43
out of came out of that hearing one
night, or the uh conference, and


650
0:52:59,43 --> 0:53:3,73
there were a bunch of guys, all environmentalists,
sitting around like they were sitting


651
0:53:3,73 --> 0:53:7,38
around the fire if there had been
a fire.  And I says, what are you


652
0:53:7,38 --> 0:53:11,14
guys doing out here?  Well we're
figuring out how to beat Chafee


653
0:53:11,14 --> 0:53:16,68
and Mitchell in the next election.
 I say, you people are stupid.


654
0:53:16,68 --> 0:53:21,3
If you didn't have Mitchell and Chafee 
a Democrat and a Republican to do


655
0:53:21,3 --> 0:53:25,16
the thoughtful patent work, you're
going to get something rammed into


656
0:53:25,16 --> 0:53:29,78
you, that you won't even know what
it looks like.  I mean, uh, you


657
0:53:29,78 --> 0:53:34,98
know, this delisting issue, I have
a word for those people out there.


658
0:53:34,98 --> 0:53:39,74
Keep your word.  I voted for the
delist, I voted for the grizzlies,


659
0:53:39,74 --> 0:53:44,27
and I voted for the wolves on the
basis that when that population


660
0:53:44,27 --> 0:53:49,69
of grizzlies reached 664, that would
be it and it would go into another


661
0:53:49,69 --> 0:53:53,71
plan.  The minute it hit there, it
went to court.  That second.


662
0:53:53,71 --> 0:53:59,8
I don't like that at all.  It's called
lying.  And then the other one was


663
0:53:59,8 --> 0:54:3,82
get to a certain breeding pair, wolves
in this and this and we'll say that's


664
0:54:3,82 --> 0:54:9,35
it.  Principle prey base of wolves
is is an ungulate.  They'll eat


665
0:54:9,35 --> 0:54:12,86
60 ungulates a year, a breeding pair.
 Well how many breeding pairs?


666
0:54:12,86 --> 0:54:18,0
I listed all that, I bought that,
 Now, here we go. The minute that


667
0:54:18,0 --> 0:54:22,32
hits, I talked to Malloy, not even a hair
 before I said, you're as ornery as I am,


668
0:54:22,32 --> 0:54:26,61
the judge.  He said, I know, but
I'm as ornery on both sides.  And


669
0:54:26,61 --> 0:54:31,62
he is.  That's good.  But never the
less, keep your word.  You can't


670
0:54:31,62 --> 0:54:36,8
have anything collaborative or honest
or anything unless you keep your


671
0:54:36,8 --> 0:54:40,73
word.  I don't like people who don't
keep their word and I can identify


672
0:54:40,73 --> 0:54:45,67
their organizations.  I'll still
go talk to them, but I'll ram it


673
0:54:45,67 --> 0:54:48,94
right in their nose, too!


674
0:54:48,94 --> 0:54:51,22
Mike Sullivan
something about the Gazoo, is....


675
0:54:51,22 --> 0:54:55,18
Bill Ruckelshaus
Let me make one point, cause Alan
mentioned there was some concern


676
0:54:55,18 --> 0:54:59,81
when the University of Wyoming started
this effort to encourage collaboration


677
0:54:59,81 --> 0:55:3,44
in the state to resolve some of these
issues.  The university's role is


678
0:55:3,44 --> 0:55:9,68
not to solve the problem.  The university's
role is to cre- to create a a center


679
0:55:9,68 --> 0:55:13,8
where people can come and resolve
their own differences.  They can


680
0:55:13,8 --> 0:55:17,44
provide facilitation, they can provide
knowledge, they can provide scientific


681
0:55:17,44 --> 0:55:22,9
information that will help inform
the discussion, but the university


682
0:55:22,9 --> 0:55:29,97
itself is not uh is using them
as a center for helping and facilitating


683
0:55:29,97 --> 0:55:34,77
collaboration doesn't solve the problem.
 I mean if the university comes


684
0:55:34,77 --> 0:55:37,97
down on one side or the other on
one of these issues officially as


685
0:55:37,97 --> 0:55:41,81
the university, they get into a huge
big controversy and become less


686
0:55:41,81 --> 0:55:47,27
successful as the university itself.
 But as a neutral form where people


687
0:55:47,27 --> 0:55:50,41
can come together and solve their
own disputes and then the university


688
0:55:50,41 --> 0:55:55,33
steps back and stays out of it, they 
perform a very useful function for the state.


689
0:55:55,33 --> 0:56:0,37
Mike Sullivan
So how would you say you get leaders


690
0:56:0,37 --> 0:56:5,94
into the collaborative process, or use 
the authority of leadership to get others


691
0:56:5,94 --> 0:56:8,62
into the collaborative process?


692
0:56:8,62 --> 0:56:11,95
John Turner
Well, I think it stops it


693
0:56:11,95 --> 0:56:17,86
starts with trying trying to be a
good listener.  Trying to be humble,


694
0:56:17,86 --> 0:56:23,9
trying to gather information, try
to find people on all sides of the


695
0:56:23,9 --> 0:56:31,58
issue who have a genuine interest
in a solution.  Um, I think today


696
0:56:31,58 --> 0:56:35,4
as we look a lot of the resource use
Alan commented on the legislative


697
0:56:35,4 --> 0:56:39,92
process, uh, I don't know if I can
offer a lot there.  But it seems


698
0:56:39,92 --> 0:56:47,66
like what brings people today together
is maybe a hammer.  It is a regulatory


699
0:56:47,66 --> 0:56:52,66
hammer hanging over people.  It might
be the Endangered Species Act, it


700
0:56:52,66 --> 0:56:58,98
might be 404, uh it might be the
Migratory Bird Act which if anybody


701
0:56:58,98 --> 0:57:2,89
reads it is a hell of a lot tougher
than the Endangered Species Act,


702
0:57:2,89 --> 0:57:8,4
uh so those are kind of hammers.
 A land owner might say, yeah, but


703
0:57:8,4 --> 0:57:11,72
there are other kinds of hammers.
 It's the income tax or state tax


704
0:57:11,72 --> 0:57:15,95
on my large ranch and I'm having
trouble with a cash flow right now


705
0:57:15,95 --> 0:57:20,77
just to pay off the pick-up and send
the kids to school, uh that might


706
0:57:20,77 --> 0:57:24,8
not be the hammer, but there are
some things you can bring the


707
0:57:24,8 --> 0:57:29,93
land owner which help make that 
positive center, uh, fortunately there


708
0:57:29,93 --> 0:57:34,7
things in the tool kit now where
we can provide a equitity cash to


709
0:57:34,7 --> 0:57:39,67
a land owner, which might allow him
to continue the operation.  It might


710
0:57:39,67 --> 0:57:44,58
be an incentive to his kids to hang
around, and so we keep our multi-generational


711
0:57:44,58 --> 0:57:50,61
ranches going, and sometimes I think
collaborative interests work simply


712
0:57:50,61 --> 0:57:57,8
because a lot of people even on diverse 
sides want to do the right thing and


713
0:57:57,8 --> 0:58:2,85
if they get a setting that is somewhat
safe, a watering hole, where people


714
0:58:2,85 --> 0:58:7,67
seem like they can be trusted, they
really want to do the right thing.


715
0:58:7,67 --> 0:58:10,58
There are people, there are conservation
people, the land owners, people


716
0:58:10,58 --> 0:58:14,69
in business, in the private sector.
 Uh, if you can take away the threats


717
0:58:14,69 --> 0:58:19,41
and they really want to do what's
best for the land or their business


718
0:58:19,41 --> 0:58:23,1
or their interests in the community.
 And if you can do that with partners


719
0:58:23,1 --> 0:58:28,49
in a non-threatening way that doesn't
get you at the other end you haven't


720
0:58:28,49 --> 0:58:33,57
given some away, uh I think it really
helps the collaborative process.


721
0:58:33,57 --> 0:58:41,31
Mike Sullivan
Let me ask this.  Uh what in your collective


722
0:58:41,31 --> 0:58:48,32
opinions, are the most sensitive environmental/
natural resources issues that we are going


723
0:58:48,32 --> 0:58:55,14
to be dealing with for the next few
years, and are they are they suitable


724
0:58:55,14 --> 0:58:56,87
for the collaborative process?


725
0:58:56,87 --> 0:58:59,25
Bill Ruckelshaus
There's one that's overriding everything.


726
0:58:59,25 --> 0:59:1,93
And that's the question of climate
change and that is not something


727
0:59:1,93 --> 0:59:6,72
of collaboration, it's a global issue.
 I mean you're just kidding yourself


728
0:59:6,72 --> 0:59:10,71
if you think you can get everybody
sit down and work that out. Uh


729
0:59:10,71 --> 0:59:13,95
uh I mentioned to you before when
we started here I'm currently involved


730
0:59:13,95 --> 0:59:18,52
in an ocean acidification panel in the state of 
Washington which is to make recommendations


731
0:59:18,52 --> 0:59:23,45
on the first of October.  And part
of the problem is as carbon is absorbed


732
0:59:23,45 --> 0:59:27,1
by the ocean, since the Industrial
Revolution really, it has been building


733
0:59:27,1 --> 0:59:32,5
up and it's about 30% higher today,
the carbon content of the ocean


734
0:59:32,5 --> 0:59:37,14
than it was when the Industrial Revolution
started.  Uh we thought this was


735
0:59:37,14 --> 0:59:40,53
a great thing because it was absorbing
a lot of the carbon that was being


736
0:59:40,53 --> 0:59:46,58
generated by burning fossil fuels,
now we see that it is causing shell


737
0:59:46,58 --> 0:59:51,32
fish to have difficulty forming shells
so that we've got oysters, that


738
0:59:51,32 --> 0:59:56,76
are about a 175 million dollar industry
in Peugeot Sound, uh a good number


739
0:59:56,76 --> 0:59:59,92
of those oysters have been unable
to form shells for the last five


740
0:59:59,92 --> 1:0:4,79
and a half years the the native oysters
grown in the hatcheries are doing just


741
1:0:4,79 --> 1:0:9,49
fine because they can filter the
water and they can take uh they


742
1:0:9,49 --> 1:0:14,26
can provide more alkalinity for it.
 But that that's just another aspect


743
1:0:14,26 --> 1:0:17,56
of the same problem, of carbon coming
out of the atmosphere.  What can


744
1:0:17,56 --> 1:0:22,8
you do about it?  You know our our
panel's supposed to make recommendations


745
1:0:22,8 --> 1:0:27,83
in about 60 days and it's not clear
what you can do about it.  Certainly


746
1:0:27,83 --> 1:0:31,74
can't do anything about the global
problem in one state.  Uh but it


747
1:0:31,74 --> 1:0:35,88
is a huge problem and something we're
going to have to figure out a way


748
1:0:35,88 --> 1:0:41,42
to deal with.  Uh through some combination
of of programs.  There's no one


749
1:0:41,42 --> 1:0:47,3
magic bullet to do it by any means.
 But we haven't yet gotten ourselves


750
1:0:47,3 --> 1:0:51,69
in a position to uh come to grips
with this issue.  Yet it's it's just


751
1:0:51,69 --> 1:0:55,77
going to really coming at us like
a freight train the longer we live.


752
1:0:55,77 --> 1:1:0,89
John Turner
I think two others that will impact the West,


753
1:1:0,89 --> 1:1:6,2
certainly may not be in the realm of what 
Bill said on climate change but it'll


754
1:1:6,2 --> 1:1:13,11
be water, the fights over water here
in the West, as the West and the Southwest face


755
1:1:13,11 --> 1:1:17,57
pretty severe droughts.  It's how
our water comes off in the spring and


756
1:1:17,57 --> 1:1:23,47
Ranchers versus fish versus cities and it'll
be Wyoming against the downstream


757
1:1:23,47 --> 1:1:28,46
states.  And uh the second issue
might be sustainability.  Uh all


758
1:1:28,46 --> 1:1:31,25
of us in our personal lives, our
business lives, our communities,


759
1:1:31,25 --> 1:1:36,97
how are we utilizing resources, how
uh much waste are we generating, how


760
1:1:36,97 --> 1:1:42,66
do we use energy, uh how do we use water.
 Uh are we good stewards for the


761
1:1:42,66 --> 1:1:46,2
resources of this country's been
blessed with.  And under the rubric


762
1:1:46,2 --> 1:1:50,21
of sustainability certainly around
the world the access to fresh water


763
1:1:50,21 --> 1:1:55,3
is you know, 2 billion people don't
have access to fresh water.  A child


764
1:1:55,3 --> 1:2:0,6
dies every 15, 20 seconds from water
born disease.  I think we have to


765
1:2:0,6 --> 1:2:3,35
be conscious of this.  2 billion
people don't have access to just


766
1:2:3,35 --> 1:2:7,9
basic energy, you're not going to
have environmental protection or


767
1:2:7,9 --> 1:2:11,85
education or good health care or
economic development, jobs, if you


768
1:2:11,85 --> 1:2:15,91
don't have access to basic energy,
that confronts a lot of the issues


769
1:2:15,91 --> 1:2:20,7
on climate change.  So uh, I think
those are some of the issues that


770
1:2:20,7 --> 1:2:22,92
are going to whirl around 
in the days ahead.


771
1:2:22,92 --> 1:2:25,64
Alan Simpson
Climate change is real.


772
1:2:25,64 --> 1:2:30,86
What what's causing it I I 
I have, I share some thoughts,


773
1:2:30,86 --> 1:2:35,6
but it's there.  Let's just say it's
there.  To deal with it, I don't


774
1:2:35,6 --> 1:2:38,39
know how you would do it.  Another
one would be in this part of the


775
1:2:38,39 --> 1:2:43,38
world, fracking, fracking with regard
to the oil and gas industry is going


776
1:2:43,38 --> 1:2:51,3
to be a big time mess around uh for
sure.  Few sheds, Um, You know.


777
1:2:51,3 --> 1:2:55,56
Look at today.  We don't even, as
far as I know we don't even have


778
1:2:55,56 --> 1:3:0,39
a fire in Wyoming but we're getting
a whole load from Idaho and Montana


779
1:3:0,39 --> 1:3:5,3
and it's very limited, kind of sad.
 But but that's the way that is.


780
1:3:5,3 --> 1:3:11,73
The other one is the ancient stuff
of water. Riparian verses appropriations


781
1:3:11,73 --> 1:3:16,48
So those are real things.  
Air quality, uh quality


782
1:3:16,48 --> 1:3:21,95
of life.  Population.  I would think
we've got it figured out that that


783
1:3:21,95 --> 1:3:29,33
your population has doubled since
the beginning of mankind.  And ready


784
1:3:29,33 --> 1:3:33,59
ready 2056, well look at those figures.
 How many foot prints will fit on


785
1:3:33,59 --> 1:3:38,1
the face of the earth?  But you don't
hear hear some of the groups talking


786
1:3:38,1 --> 1:3:43,28
about that!  That's critical.  Because,
you know, some civilizations have


787
1:3:43,28 --> 1:3:47,84
disappeared because they ate the
last animal and took the last stick


788
1:3:47,84 --> 1:3:51,71
of wood and used the last resource
and they're gone.  Don't know why


789
1:3:51,71 --> 1:3:55,26
they're gone, but they're gone. 
So those are issues that don't get


790
1:3:55,26 --> 1:3:59,93
dealt with cause you're into religion,
and you're into this and you're


791
1:3:59,93 --> 1:4:5,48
into that, it's all shaded into 4
things that I've found in my public


792
1:4:5,48 --> 1:4:11,72
life.  Emotion, fear, guilt, and
racism.  And either pass or kill


793
1:4:11,72 --> 1:4:18,16
or support or get rid of something
using a deft blend of emotion, fear,


794
1:4:18,16 --> 1:4:25,57
guilt, and racism.  It's hell of
a fun place to work.  [Laughter.]


795
1:4:25,57 --> 1:4:27,9
Mike Sullivan
Great place to live too!


796
1:4:27,9 --> 1:4:30,24
Bill Ruckelshaus
Another issue that we we'll


797
1:4:30,24 --> 1:4:36,5
we've got to context issue we have
to think about.  I was born in 1932.


798
1:4:36,5 --> 1:4:40,5
And uh when I was born we had a
little over 2 billion people on


799
1:4:40,5 --> 1:4:44,2
earth.  Last summer we announced
that we have over 7 billion people


800
1:4:44,2 --> 1:4:48,49
on earth.  We have a lot more technology
than we did 80 years ago when I


801
1:4:48,49 --> 1:4:53,12
was born.  We have a lot more wealth, may not feel like it,
not right now in the middle of this


802
1:4:53,12 --> 1:5:0,89
recession, but we have a lot more 
wealth globally than we had uh 80 years


803
1:5:0,89 --> 1:5:4,78
ago.  And that's from the beginning
of man's time on earth to 1932 we


804
1:5:4,78 --> 1:5:9,9
had 2 billion people.  Just in my
lifetime we have more than tripled


805
1:5:9,9 --> 1:5:14,3
that.  7 billion people, more than
that now, since a year and a half


806
1:5:14,3 --> 1:5:22,8
has passed.  So then the real question
is in thinking about these ecosystems,


807
1:5:22,8 --> 1:5:28,4
a lot about which we are talking
today, how how do you preserve these


808
1:5:28,4 --> 1:5:33,8
ecosystems,  and these goods and services
of these ecosystems, water, air,


809
1:5:33,8 --> 1:5:39,77
earth, provide us, and at the same
time accommodate the needs of man


810
1:5:39,77 --> 1:5:43,7
and man's desire to be prosperous
within that ecosystem?


811
1:5:43,7 --> 1:5:49,57
Man cannot be seen as separate from the 
ecosystem, we are part of the ecosystem.


812
1:5:49,57 --> 1:5:53,7
And if we can't figure out a way to live
consistent with the other living


813
1:5:53,7 --> 1:5:58,46
things that share the space of this
planet with us, and and make it


814
1:5:58,46 --> 1:6:3,4
as possible as we can that those
other living things can prosper


815
1:6:3,4 --> 1:6:7,5
as well, it is ultimately going to
effect us.   So we we need to begin


816
1:6:7,5 --> 1:6:10,41
to think of ourselves not as if we're
going to set aside some wilderness


817
1:6:10,41 --> 1:6:15,1
and never let man in there therefore
it'll make a field of it, that's fine,


818
1:6:15,1 --> 1:6:18,31
but by the same token we are occupying 
more and more of the ecosystems of


819
1:6:18,31 --> 1:6:21,22
the world and we're part of it 
and we'ver got to figure out how


820
1:6:21,22 --> 1:6:25,69
to be how how to cause man to prosper 
and at the same time the other living


821
1:6:25,69 --> 1:6:29,93
things in that ecosystem to prosper as well.


822
1:6:29,93 --> 1:6:33,48
Mike Sullivan
When you have the federal government


823
1:6:33,48 --> 1:6:38,1
owning more than half the land, or
half the land but more than half


824
1:6:38,1 --> 1:6:46,27
the minerals, how do you effectively
get the federal government into


825
1:6:46,27 --> 1:6:51,96
collaborative processes?


826
1:6:51,96 --> 1:6:54,59
[Laughter] Come on Jump on that!


827
1:6:54,59 --> 1:6:57,12
Bill Ruckelshaus
The answer is leadership!  It really is!


828
1:6:57,12 --> 1:7:0,83
There is no reason the people
running the federal agencies that


829
1:7:0,83 --> 1:7:5,72
have so much impact on the land of the West 
not be collaborative, not to include


830
1:7:5,72 --> 1:7:8,69
the people that are going to be impacted
by whatever decisions they make,


831
1:7:8,69 --> 1:7:13,63
by whatever changes they make.  You've
got to do that in order to get the


832
1:7:13,63 --> 1:7:17,41
people to where effectively support
every decision you make and if you're


833
1:7:17,41 --> 1:7:21,42
not any good at that you're not any
good at leadership.  You know.


834
1:7:21,42 --> 1:7:25,38
It seems to me that it's absolutely
necessary that part of the federal


835
1:7:25,38 --> 1:7:31,1
official's responsibilities are seeing
as as both listening hard to what


836
1:7:31,1 --> 1:7:35,87
people say or or their intr- interests
and bring those along in whatever


837
1:7:35,87 --> 1:7:40,75
decisions they make so it has 
a chance of being durable.


838
1:7:40,75 --> 1:7:47,15
John Turner
I think uh sometimes almost in


839
1:7:47,15 --> 1:7:50,26
the western states get a 
little bit of an inferiority


840
1:7:50,26 --> 1:7:54,99
complex, we do too much whining.  Uh
it seems like that's always good


841
1:7:54,99 --> 1:8:1,74
politics. Uh. And yet I think uh with
the right kind of leadership uh


842
1:8:1,74 --> 1:8:8,24
from the governor's office, delegation,
and uh having once been a federal


843
1:8:8,24 --> 1:8:14,5
bureaucrat uh in a federal agency
I think uh those agencies for the


844
1:8:14,5 --> 1:8:19,54
most part have some very good people.
 And if we don't start by beating


845
1:8:19,54 --> 1:8:23,74
the tar out of them but working with
the regional directors, working


846
1:8:23,74 --> 1:8:28,91
with the secretaries, uh, on western
issues.  Now, some of those are


847
1:8:28,91 --> 1:8:31,96
going to be fraught with there's
no way that we're going to get an


848
1:8:31,96 --> 1:8:36,39
adequate solution, but I think there's
a lot of examples where the people


849
1:8:36,39 --> 1:8:41,0
in the West under your leadership
and others, and today with Matt


850
1:8:41,0 --> 1:8:44,45
Mead, the right kind of delegation,
bringing in the right kind of people


851
1:8:44,45 --> 1:8:50,13
with with uh our congressional delegation
and so forth, uh I see a lot of


852
1:8:50,13 --> 1:8:55,21
promise in the western states coming
together and finding some solutions.


853
1:8:55,21 --> 1:9:1,51
I see where governor Mead now heads
up an eight state effort on sage grouse,


854
1:9:1,51 --> 1:9:6,14
which is one of those hammers hanging
over the western states, and I think


855
1:9:6,14 --> 1:9:9,41
is is an opportunity where the western
states can come up with a toolkit


856
1:9:9,41 --> 1:9:12,82
and plan a  strategy that would be
way out ahead of what the feds are


857
1:9:12,82 --> 1:9:17,95
looking at.  And thus get a lot of
diverse groups in behind it.


858
1:9:17,95 --> 1:9:22,9
So I think there's real opportunity
if the western states would whine


859
1:9:22,9 --> 1:9:29,94
a little bit less, and uh thoughtfully
uh approach our federal agencies


860
1:9:29,94 --> 1:9:36,57
and take partners with them, the
private sector and uh reasonable nonprofit


861
1:9:36,57 --> 1:9:41,22
groups, I I do feel there's more
middle ground than we sometimes admit.


862
1:9:41,22 --> 1:9:43,65
Mike Sullivan
Thank you, let me just say that


863
1:9:43,65 --> 1:9:49,9
you're talking about the sage grouse. 
 It seems to me that is an issue that has


864
1:9:49,9 --> 1:9:54,36
lent itself to collaborative processes 
both state and federal and it's partly


865
1:9:54,36 --> 1:9:57,71
because there's such a big hammer.


866
1:9:57,71 --> 1:10:0,34
Alan Simpson
I think, I sense that there's more


867
1:10:0,34 --> 1:10:4,79
listening and more transparency in
every one of those laws that we


868
1:10:4,79 --> 1:10:8,92
worked with uh when the federal 
government was doing something, that's


869
1:10:8,92 --> 1:10:13,82
our landlord, was doing something
 to the tenants.  There was a way to


870
1:10:13,82 --> 1:10:18,17
the tenants to speak, uh and I think
they're listening.  I think I see


871
1:10:18,17 --> 1:10:22,6
that in the Shoshoni force with things
of recent vintage.  I see that with


872
1:10:22,6 --> 1:10:27,81
Yellowstone Park.  We held those
hearings in in Wyoming and Cody.


873
1:10:27,81 --> 1:10:32,54
I think what's happening, when you
have one of those meetings and and


874
1:10:32,54 --> 1:10:37,41
the nut job gets up and starts frothing
at the mouth, people sit for a while


875
1:10:37,41 --> 1:10:41,88
and then they say, why don't you
shut up?  So that we can get on


876
1:10:41,88 --> 1:10:47,57
with the discussion here!  That is, I
I think is is happening and that


877
1:10:47,57 --> 1:10:53,18
I I think is very good.  Listening
takes place, and uh they all have


878
1:10:53,18 --> 1:10:58,17
a process of participation.  And
I think there's I think more listening


879
1:10:58,17 --> 1:11:2,63
going on with what's local of course,
local feeling in the Yellowstone Park.


880
1:11:2,63 --> 1:11:8,28
Sylvan Pass, and ice climbing.  There's 
more listening.  I think that's good.


881
1:11:8,28 --> 1:11:10,67
Mike Sullivan
On that positive note,


882
1:11:10,67 --> 1:11:16,66
We're going to open 
it up to questions from the audience.


883
1:11:16,66 --> 1:11:20,1
Male Speaker
 Tyler Krutzfelf.  I'm a Montana guy.  But on the ...


884
1:11:20,1 --> 1:11:24,84
Mike Sullivan
We didn't beat up on you hard enough!  [Laughter.]


885
1:11:24,84 --> 1:11:27,58
Tyler Krutzfelf
On the uh current topic of coal export,


886
1:11:27,58 --> 1:11:33,9
which would most likely benefit 
Montana and Wyoming, there's a cash


887
1:11:33,9 --> 1:11:37,53
being spent on both sides of that
 dialogue, by the environmental


888
1:11:37,53 --> 1:11:42,54
community, the face of Washington, 
Oregon, and the uh coal community.


889
1:11:42,54 --> 1:11:51,16
Is that issue an example of uh
 an uh collaborative opportunity maybe perhaps


890
1:11:51,16 --> 1:11:56,74
for that policy and the Ruckelshaus Institute in
 Washington state and Laramie?


891
1:11:56,74 --> 1:12:2,16
Bill Ruckelshaus
The coal export uh issue is is very hot


892
1:12:2,16 --> 1:12:8,18
right now in the state of Washington.
  Uh probably too hot to be subject to


893
1:12:8,18 --> 1:12:16,39
collaboration uh Alan mentioned several 
hours ago, we've been speaking [Laughter], uh


894
1:12:16,39 --> 1:12:20,92
Alan Simpson
he didn't have a good breakfast!


895
1:12:20,92 --> 1:12:26,15
[Laughter]
 he's a bit testy this morning.


896
1:12:26,15 --> 1:12:29,78
Bill Ruckelshaus
He was, I can't even remember what


897
1:12:29,78 --> 1:12:36,24
it was I was going to say.  But that that 
issue is probably not right, we mentioned


898
1:12:36,24 --> 1:12:41,7
rightness, for collaboration because
there is too much emotion involved,


899
1:12:41,7 --> 1:12:44,23
particularly in the opposition to
it and I think they are kind


900
1:12:44,23 --> 1:12:51,47
of entrenched right now.  Over time,
if it looked like some kind of export


901
1:12:51,47 --> 1:12:55,3
facility moving forward then 
you'd get more in the


902
1:12:55,3 --> 1:12:59,26
mood of beginning to discuss what
form should that export take, and


903
1:12:59,26 --> 1:13:1,9
how many trains should come into
the state, what's going to happen


904
1:13:1,9 --> 1:13:4,22
to the coal dust.  I'm mean, there's
all these kinds of issues being


905
1:13:4,22 --> 1:13:9,5
raised by the opposition to the export,
and I don't think that as of this


906
1:13:9,5 --> 1:13:13,81
juncture they would be ready to sit
down with those who want to export


907
1:13:13,81 --> 1:13:17,38
the coal and really work it out.
 I haven't asked them that question,


908
1:13:17,38 --> 1:13:22,12
so I don't know that, but what we
do, and I think it the same thing


909
1:13:22,12 --> 1:13:25,36
is true of Wyoming, in the state
of Washington is do this assessment


910
1:13:25,36 --> 1:13:28,24
ahead of time and ask every body
what they think.  If they're not


911
1:13:28,24 --> 1:13:31,9
willing to sit down, we recommend
that they not try one of these processes.


912
1:13:31,9 --> 1:13:34,64
Because they don't have a very 
good chance at working.


913
1:13:34,64 --> 1:13:42,81
John Turner
Well, it's a good question for Wyoming.


914
1:13:42,81 --> 1:13:48,94
I hap I happen to be pretty strong 
advocate of coal and in the way of


915
1:13:48,94 --> 1:13:53,31
transparency is one and it's important 
to the people of Wyoming. It pays


916
1:13:53,31 --> 1:13:57,61
a lot of our bills, it pays for our
school, it builds our hospitals,


917
1:13:57,61 --> 1:14:0,91
provides money for management of
natural resources.  So coal's pretty


918
1:14:0,91 --> 1:14:4,31
important in the state of Wyoming, 
the largest coal deposit that's in


919
1:14:4,31 --> 1:14:10,26
political jurisdiction in the world.
 And uh helps light a lot of homes


920
1:14:10,26 --> 1:14:17,81
and and provide energy for businesses
and jobs across America.  So it's


921
1:14:17,81 --> 1:14:22,93
important in Wyoming and I also uh
serve on the Board of Directors


922
1:14:22,93 --> 1:14:26,76
at Peabody Energy, the largest coal
company in the world, and we're


923
1:14:26,76 --> 1:14:31,94
interested in actively exporting
coal.  We're the largest coal miner


924
1:14:31,94 --> 1:14:37,11
in the Powder River Basin, pay a
lot of taxes in Wyoming, uh, but


925
1:14:37,11 --> 1:14:42,18
we're exporting Wyoming coal now,
it's going in barges and we ship


926
1:14:42,18 --> 1:14:47,42
from Houston and the ports.  And
so uh it's going to be an active


927
1:14:47,42 --> 1:14:53,45
outlet for coal from the Illinois
basin, uh, some Appalachian coal,


928
1:14:53,45 --> 1:15:0,47
but especially met coal used for
making steel.  You have thermal


929
1:15:0,47 --> 1:15:6,55
coal and met coal.  Uh if you go
around the world and uh and look


930
1:15:6,55 --> 1:15:11,5
at what's happening, coal's the fastest
growing, uh, energy source now in


931
1:15:11,5 --> 1:15:16,23
the world.  And there's a coal plant
every 2 or 3 days now coming online


932
1:15:16,23 --> 1:15:23,31
in India and China.  Coal is America's
most abundant energy resource, so


933
1:15:23,31 --> 1:15:28,21
it would seem to me rather than trying
to just do coal in which a lot of


934
1:15:28,21 --> 1:15:33,4
groups would like to do, and admittedly
coal is at a disadvantage currently.


935
1:15:33,4 --> 1:15:39,1
with the wonderful finds in 
natural gas that's been happening.


936
1:15:39,1 --> 1:15:43,89
shale gas throughout the United States
but the price of coal is depressed.


937
1:15:43,89 --> 1:15:48,83
But US coal is going, if it's not
burned here in the United States


938
1:15:48,83 --> 1:15:53,7
it's for darned sure going to go
overseas.  And if it isn't US coal,


939
1:15:53,7 --> 1:15:57,33
if it isn't Wyoming coal, it'll be
Indonesia coal which is poor ore,


940
1:15:57,33 --> 1:16:4,31
it'll come out of Australia, South
Africa, perhaps Mongolia.  So uh,


941
1:16:4,31 --> 1:16:9,75
I think it's going to be an export
product out of the United States,


942
1:16:9,75 --> 1:16:14,83
whether it goes uh out of Washington
in the Columbia River there's some


943
1:16:14,83 --> 1:16:19,34
pretty advocate groups out there,
uh remains to be seen.  But uh there're


944
1:16:19,34 --> 1:16:23,34
terminals being built in Houston,
there's current terminals there,


945
1:16:23,34 --> 1:16:27,28
so uh we're going to be moving coal
out of the United States in the


946
1:16:27,28 --> 1:16:31,5
export market.  If not us it'll come
from Columbia and other sources.


947
1:16:31,5 --> 1:16:36,18
Bob Lewdel
Um, John, this is a uh, a uh, this is a


948
1:16:36,18 --> 1:16:40,48
uh question uh but but maybe not 
really a question.  Going back to


949
1:16:40,48 --> 1:16:49,28
2000 you'll, Bob Lewdel, good to see you, John.  
You'll remember in 2000 we were in Missoula


950
1:16:49,28 --> 1:16:53,5
and uh we formed uh, and you were
there representing the Conservation


951
1:16:53,5 --> 1:16:57,33
Fund, and we formed the American
Wildlife Conservation Partners,


952
1:16:57,33 --> 1:17:1,29
and we struggled for 2 days as you
probably recall, and we put together


953
1:17:1,29 --> 1:17:6,91
some uh 30 uh hunter conservation
organizations.  Now we are 50 hunter


954
1:17:6,91 --> 1:17:11,79
conservation organizations.  Uh we
have provided for the uh Bush administration


955
1:17:11,79 --> 1:17:19,9
uh 1 in 2 for wildlife for uh the
21st century.  Buying 1 and 2 for


956
1:17:19,9 --> 1:17:23,79
Bush and buying 3 for uh the Obama
Administration.  We picked out the


957
1:17:23,79 --> 1:17:28,12
most important issues that faced
the uh uh hunting community, the


958
1:17:28,12 --> 1:17:31,66
uh, hunting community, were the first
conservationists founded by the


959
1:17:31,66 --> 1:17:39,42
Boone and Crocket back in 1887.  Uh,
John, uh, we have, uh 50 groups now.


960
1:17:39,42 --> 1:17:45,9
We uh, are are strong and well.  We 
work together, NRA, Boone and Crocket


961
1:17:45,9 --> 1:17:51,33
uh, Russell Sportsman's Foundation, 
the Isaac Walton League, all


962
1:17:51,33 --> 1:17:55,57
come together.  We have sign
on letters that go uh to uh the


963
1:17:55,57 --> 1:18:2,17
uh uh various uh uh members on the
uh uh US Congress, the administration,


964
1:18:2,17 --> 1:18:8,95
on issues that are important to us.
 Uh we uh got the uh uh President


965
1:18:8,95 --> 1:18:13,86
Bush uh to sign an executive order
for a wildlife conference, uh in


966
1:18:13,86 --> 1:18:18,74
2008, as you will remember.  And
that was uh 100 years after Teddy


967
1:18:18,74 --> 1:18:22,77
Roosevelt's first uh conservation
uh summit on wildlife and natural


968
1:18:22,77 --> 1:18:28,9
resources.  Uh.  We are now beginning
to uh engage the environmental community,


969
1:18:28,9 --> 1:18:34,38
and uh it it's kind of interesting,
John, because uh the reason why


970
1:18:34,38 --> 1:18:37,98
they are engaging with us is our
science is better, we're getting


971
1:18:37,98 --> 1:18:44,82
reception from uh uh not only our
our legislators, uh but also uh


972
1:18:44,82 --> 1:18:49,82
from the executive uh branch of government.
 And uh the uh environmental community


973
1:18:49,82 --> 1:18:54,88
is uh edging closer to us and uh
we're making overtures, uh, that


974
1:18:54,88 --> 1:18:59,92
uh one would not have thought possible,
you know, 5 or 6 years ago.  So


975
1:18:59,92 --> 1:19:3,18
I just wanted to uh to point out,
because you and I have not had a


976
1:19:3,18 --> 1:19:6,38
chance to talk about that recently,
but to me this is one of the great


977
1:19:6,38 --> 1:19:12,63
uh examples of collaboration uh working
and it's working in a very quiet


978
1:19:12,63 --> 1:19:17,12
way, very effective way, and we're
pretty proud of it and as you


979
1:19:17,12 --> 1:19:24,13
recall, we were there in smoky  
Missoula in 2000 and uh here we are some


980
1:19:24,13 --> 1:19:28,89
12 years later and and uh it's been
a very successful and gratifying,


981
1:19:28,89 --> 1:19:34,97
uh, experience and just sort of an
example of, to what the 3 of you


982
1:19:34,97 --> 1:19:40,0
have been talking to uh uh the last
hour and a half.  Thank you.


983
1:19:40,0 --> 1:19:42,7
Mike Sullivan
Thank you, Bob.


984
1:19:42,7 --> 1:19:43,98
John Turner
Bob, thanks for being here, and thanks


985
1:19:43,98 --> 1:19:48,77
for the decades of you being in the 
trenches working for wildlife and


986
1:19:48,77 --> 1:19:53,54
collaborative efforts.  And indeed the 
partnership, the coalition, the science


987
1:19:53,54 --> 1:19:58,2
they're bringing just out of the Upper 
Green, on uh mule deer, and uh fisheries,


988
1:19:58,2 --> 1:20:4,82
and pronghorn migration routes, and
you're, as you continue to be, a


989
1:20:4,82 --> 1:20:8,84
real leader in them and I salute
you.  Uh indeed the sportsman in


990
1:20:8,84 --> 1:20:12,66
this country has been at the forefront
of conservation and putting their


991
1:20:12,66 --> 1:20:16,96
money and their resources into protecting
habitat and watersheds and I salute


992
1:20:16,96 --> 1:20:22,43
you.  And Mike, I'd just like to
say on coal I didn't say, I think


993
1:20:22,43 --> 1:20:25,99
what we all need to do is work for
a lot of the science that is going


994
1:20:25,99 --> 1:20:31,3
on where uh on clean coal where we
can strip carbon uh we ought to


995
1:20:31,3 --> 1:20:37,72
continue it here in the United States
and fortunately the new energy school


996
1:20:37,72 --> 1:20:42,7
in down at the UW has got some will
have some excellent research ongoing.


997
1:20:42,7 --> 1:20:46,95
How do we use coal, to continue
to use it for America's future,


998
1:20:46,95 --> 1:20:51,64
for jobs, income and and in the coal
better, we've stripped most of the


999
1:20:51,64 --> 1:20:57,63
pollution out of coal in the last many
 years.  Now the challenge is carbon.


1000
1:20:57,63 --> 1:20:58,78
Jack Durnell
  I'm Jack Dernell from Meeteetee


1001
1:20:58,78 --> 1:21:5,6
Uh, trying to make it as short as I can.
  I was enthused to be here today cause


1002
1:21:5,6 --> 1:21:10,22
I was with you when we, oh, Ted, and a few
people, when we started this thing


1003
1:21:10,22 --> 1:21:16,73
at Laramie 18 years ago I guess.
 Time flies, but what got me interested


1004
1:21:16,73 --> 1:21:22,58
in it was black footed ferret of
course.  We formed an advisory group,


1005
1:21:22,58 --> 1:21:26,95
I said this is chaos, so we formed
it, not knowing what we's doing,


1006
1:21:26,95 --> 1:21:33,13
but 14 years later I guess we saved
them.  But during that time Governor


1007
1:21:33,13 --> 1:21:40,25
Sullivan uh started some, oh like
with ranchers and management process


1008
1:21:40,25 --> 1:21:45,34
where we could bring in advisory people
into the ranch which was not very


1009
1:21:45,34 --> 1:21:51,13
popular, and different ranchers could
get all kinds of different groups


1010
1:21:51,13 --> 1:21:57,46
to come in and collaborate, on their
ranch, and the wildlife, the rains,


1011
1:21:57,46 --> 1:22:5,94
the hydrology, anything that might
pop to mind.  And we also had bureaucracies


1012
1:22:5,94 --> 1:22:11,14
that had advisory boards, which me
and several others have served on.


1013
1:22:11,14 --> 1:22:17,1
So my question is all about collaboration.
 I understand it, I've been in tons


1014
1:22:17,1 --> 1:22:23,0
of groups of collaboration, but every
time, I'm not going just to pick


1015
1:22:23,0 --> 1:22:27,83
on the BLM, but they had rules, codes,
regulations, that said we could


1016
1:22:27,83 --> 1:22:33,13
do this, this this, and this.  I
said, yeah, but we worked for a


1017
1:22:33,13 --> 1:22:38,5
total year on the advisory group
uh working out a plan for Wyoming


1018
1:22:38,5 --> 1:22:45,8
and Wyoming's BLM plans.  And it
had environmentalists, it had hard


1019
1:22:45,8 --> 1:22:51,28
noses like me, ranchers, and we 
collaborated and at the end of the day


1020
1:22:51,28 --> 1:22:56,4
we had an agreement except for one 
thing, and it always came down to that


1021
1:22:56,4 --> 1:23:3,49
with the bureaucracy. I said, you
cannot collaborate for Meeteetse


1022
1:23:3,49 --> 1:23:10,27
Wyoming, or Evanston or Gillette
or coal or anything else unless


1023
1:23:10,27 --> 1:23:16,56
the local people, the social and
the economic system comes down to


1024
1:23:16,56 --> 1:23:21,92
them and they have to play a part.
 What they did is eliminate our


1025
1:23:21,92 --> 1:23:27,3
advisory board in Wyoming so we had
no BLM advisory board.  They just


1026
1:23:27,3 --> 1:23:31,28
said, no, can't do that.   We can
do the five that you agreed on the resources.


1027
1:23:31,28 --> 1:23:37,86
But social and economics has nothing
to do with resource management.


1028
1:23:37,86 --> 1:23:43,47
And it happened time and time and
time again.  And I've collaborated


1029
1:23:43,47 --> 1:23:48,82
with the Fish and Wildlife Services
recently in the last 5 years in


1030
1:23:48,82 --> 1:23:54,2
DC.  I went there and they came to
me and we did changed ideas and


1031
1:23:54,2 --> 1:23:58,71
things like that.  So I understood
them better.  But it still bothers


1032
1:23:58,71 --> 1:24:4,29
me.  You gotta have the local people
involved, social, economic has to


1033
1:24:4,29 --> 1:24:8,82
be involved, in resource management.
 If you don't do it, you're going


1034
1:24:8,82 --> 1:24:11,82
to fail.  Do you agree or disagree?


1035
1:24:11,82 --> 1:24:14,27
Bill Ruckelshaus
I mentioned earlier, you has to


1036
1:24:14,27 --> 1:24:17,48
see all the people as part of 
the ecosystem.  They have to


1037
1:24:17,48 --> 1:24:21,95
be allowed to prosper just like other
things do.  And the leadership at


1038
1:24:21,95 --> 1:24:26,56
the national level has to understand
that in order to make progress against


1039
1:24:26,56 --> 1:24:31,2
their own priorities.  And if they
don't do that, it isn't effectively


1040
1:24:31,2 --> 1:24:36,62
done, and it is done, as a number, as 
Al said recently, it it's been done in a


1041
1:24:36,62 --> 1:24:40,52
number of areas and where it's not
done it doesn't work. So that's


1042
1:24:40,52 --> 1:24:45,49
really what I mean by leadership
in in those national agencies.


1043
1:24:45,49 --> 1:24:47,49
Mike Sullivan
The black footed ferret wouldn't be


1044
1:24:47,49 --> 1:24:53,59
here  now except for the actions of 
Jack Turnell who was the one that


1045
1:24:53,59 --> 1:25:3,52
discovered it on his ranch and 
took the time. [Applause]


1046
1:25:3,52 --> 1:25:9,66
Okay.  Let's go here.  You notice


1047
1:25:9,66 --> 1:25:12,5
I'm favoring the right.  
Now figure that one out!


1048
1:25:12,5 --> 1:25:16,38
[Laughter]


1049
1:25:16,38 --> 1:25:19,7
David Dominc
David Dominc, and uh from Cody.


1050
1:25:19,7 --> 1:25:23,7
I used to work under that Bill Ruckelshaus


1051
1:25:23,7 --> 1:25:29,34
guy.  Uh, it seems to me that uh
we've heard about the bad guys,


1052
1:25:29,34 --> 1:25:35,42
we know who they are, the coal, the
oil, the frackers, etc.  But, uh,


1053
1:25:35,42 --> 1:25:40,72
I was at the uh 45th anniversary
of the Wyoming Outdoor Council the other


1054
1:25:40,72 --> 1:25:47,15
day  down in Lander, and it occurs to me 
that we have these environmental groups,


1055
1:25:47,15 --> 1:25:51,62
I think Bob O'Dell talked about
the wildlife people, the hunters


1056
1:25:51,62 --> 1:25:54,64
and fishers, but we've got these
wildlife groups in the is state,


1057
1:25:54,64 --> 1:25:59,89
Wyoming Outdoor Council, Sierra Club,
Audubon society, of which I'm a


1058
1:25:59,89 --> 1:26:4,94
member, Potter Resource Group, Nature
Conservancy, Greater Yellowstone


1059
1:26:4,94 --> 1:26:12,48
Coalition, uh and have they ever
gotten together and asked and collaborated?


1060
1:26:12,48 --> 1:26:15,63
The word I got from one of the
heads of that was, well we might


1061
1:26:15,63 --> 1:26:20,24
if we had something in common.  And
I think that as an environmentalist,


1062
1:26:20,24 --> 1:26:25,5
uh that's something uh that our side
out to begin to work on. Thank you.


1063
1:26:25,5 --> 1:26:27,54
Mike Sullivan
Well let's leave that there.


1064
1:26:27,54 --> 1:26:30,29
[Laughter]


1065
1:26:30,29 --> 1:26:32,82
Bill Ruckelshaus
He's right!  I mean, David, it's nice to


1066
1:26:32,82 --> 1:26:36,91
see you again.  He was in charge
of the water program when he first


1067
1:26:36,91 --> 1:26:41,69
started to come over to the Interior
Department.  And uh the truth is


1068
1:26:41,69 --> 1:26:45,14
that environmental groups aren't
any more homogeneous than business


1069
1:26:45,14 --> 1:26:52,39
or anybody else.  Uh and uh
they do cooperate often, not always,


1070
1:26:52,39 --> 1:26:56,66
and when you can't, when they're
necessary for the decision to stick


1071
1:26:56,66 --> 1:27:0,22
and they're not willing to cooperate
then you're better off not starting.


1072
1:27:0,22 --> 1:27:5,8
Uh when they are willing to compromise
and work together, real progress can be had.


1073
1:27:5,8 --> 1:27:12,19
Male Speaker
I haven't hear y'all mention the


1074
1:27:12,19 --> 1:27:18,57
National Environmental Policy Act and 
the cooperating part of it.  Especially


1075
1:27:18,57 --> 1:27:24,69
where we brought in the county commissioners
and other conservation district


1076
1:27:24,69 --> 1:27:34,91
or facts were entered into these
uh uh evaluation processes, NEPA,


1077
1:27:34,91 --> 1:27:43,35
to uh, get the facts.  And I think
uh, I think the way you're using


1078
1:27:43,35 --> 1:27:52,52
Yellowstone, uh, a number of things
I could go on.  But.  The facts


1079
1:27:52,52 --> 1:27:58,29
haven't been considered in a manner
that they should.  That's why I


1080
1:27:58,29 --> 1:28:3,75
wanted your perspective on the National
Environmental Policy Act.


1081
1:28:3,75 --> 1:28:7,46
John Turner
I think uh the written in the 70s,


1082
1:28:7,46 --> 1:28:12,11
uh I think past the Nixon administration,
was a very well intentioned that before we


1083
1:28:12,11 --> 1:28:16,29
embark on federal action that we really 
look at a comprehensive environment and


1084
1:28:16,29 --> 1:28:24,1
social impacts. Uh, I said well 
intended because my own personal opinion


1085
1:28:24,1 --> 1:28:31,0
is that NEPA's gotten so mired in 
processing bulk that it has become


1086
1:28:31,0 --> 1:28:38,8
less than user friendly.  Very uh 
attuned to activist groups, private sector,


1087
1:28:38,8 --> 1:28:44,75
non private, uh can stay involved
in a very complex agency process,


1088
1:28:44,75 --> 1:28:50,1
but for average America to get
 plugged into what becomes thousands


1089
1:28:50,1 --> 1:28:56,8
of pages and uh provide uh 
useful feedback to the federal


1090
1:28:56,8 --> 1:29:0,8
agency proposing action uh I'm not
saying we throw it out, but I think


1091
1:29:0,8 --> 1:29:6,15
it's time we revisited NEPA.  And
see how we can make it a process


1092
1:29:6,15 --> 1:29:12,73
that uh Americans across the board
can find where they can plug into


1093
1:29:12,73 --> 1:29:17,48
it, uh learn something basic, and
then provide feedback.  It just


1094
1:29:17,48 --> 1:29:25,37
seems like NEPA has has grown into
a little a monster in process and bulk.


1095
1:29:25,37 --> 1:29:30,41
Bill Ruckelshaus
I think the uh I would agree with


1096
1:29:30,41 --> 1:29:34,33
John that certainly that was not what was 
intended when NEPA was first passed.


1097
1:29:34,33 --> 1:29:39,2
Uh it was introduced by Senator Jackson, 
from the state of Washington, and it


1098
1:29:39,2 --> 1:29:44,18
was meant that when there was major federal
projects it was restricted to federal


1099
1:29:44,18 --> 1:29:49,14
projects, there should be an understanding
of the environmental impact of what


1100
1:29:49,14 --> 1:29:55,45
that project entailed.  It certainly
didn't, it has evolved into a monster


1101
1:29:55,45 --> 1:30:0,82
maybe, I don't think too strong of
a word, to describe it.  And it


1102
1:30:0,82 --> 1:30:3,99
may be that a collaborative process
could be used to take a look at


1103
1:30:3,99 --> 1:30:9,82
NEPA and see if it can't improve
it.  Not to abandon the idea of


1104
1:30:9,82 --> 1:30:13,51
taking into effect the environmental
impact of what you're doing, but


1105
1:30:13,51 --> 1:30:17,23
doing it in a more rational fashion
than exists under existing law.


1106
1:30:17,23 --> 1:30:24,73
It really is a a tremendous boon
to consulting firms that do extremely


1107
1:30:24,73 --> 1:30:31,21
well by undertaking these 4000 page
reports. To what extent it really


1108
1:30:31,21 --> 1:30:37,16
has an impact on development that
has been official versus the cost of


1109
1:30:37,16 --> 1:30:42,25
it, is is kind of hard to justify
today. I think I think therefore


1110
1:30:42,25 --> 1:30:45,17
I think we should take a look at
how we can streamline; streamline


1111
1:30:45,17 --> 1:30:49,82
NEPA and make it work a lot better.
 That may be possible if the Congress


1112
1:30:49,82 --> 1:30:57,9
were to were to in effect convene
in a convener and convene a group


1113
1:30:57,9 --> 1:30:59,6
that could take an honest look at
it and make recommendations for


1114
1:30:59,6 --> 1:31:3,64
improvement.  That would be the use
of collaboration that I would think


1115
1:31:3,64 --> 1:31:5,43
would be very valuable.


1116
1:31:5,43 --> 1:31:7,47
Alan Simpson
I think one of the things that


1117
1:31:7,47 --> 1:31:13,15
when I was there became, and uh still
am a delightful friend of C Sanders,


1118
1:31:13,15 --> 1:31:18,27
who was the Democrat Secretary of
Interior, earthy, wonderful guy,


1119
1:31:18,27 --> 1:31:23,98
and uh, when we went out he said,
god, I came here with the thought


1120
1:31:23,98 --> 1:31:28,74
we could get something done.  And
he said that all these groups that


1121
1:31:28,74 --> 1:31:33,63
fight everything are all connected.
 Their their funding sources are


1122
1:31:33,63 --> 1:31:39,56
connected, their families are connected,
it goes deep down into the system.


1123
1:31:39,56 --> 1:31:45,45
And I said, really?  He said, yeah.
 He got out his little chart.  Then


1124
1:31:45,45 --> 1:31:49,51
there was a thing called the same
facts were being generated, and


1125
1:31:49,51 --> 1:31:54,72
then a new name would pop up, uh,
Save the Earth Quickly, or Save


1126
1:31:54,72 --> 1:31:59,84
the Earth in 10 Years, or Save the
Earth Whatever, just all funded


1127
1:31:59,84 --> 1:32:6,88
by this amazing network of people
who hire leagues of lawyers who


1128
1:32:6,88 --> 1:32:11,12
are good people.  All lawyers are
good people.     [Laughter]


1129
1:32:11,12 --> 1:32:14,51
But it's almost like the old phrase,
you unbuttoned your shirt and your


1130
1:32:14,51 --> 1:32:19,1
heart fell out.  Because they have
lost sight of what really is going


1131
1:32:19,1 --> 1:32:21,22
on in the world.


1132
1:32:21,22 --> 1:32:23,69



1133
1:32:23,69 --> 1:32:25,13
Male Speaker:
First of all, I need to thank John


1134
1:32:25,13 --> 1:32:28,83
Turner for the fine uh commercial
for the Wyoming Stock Growers' Land


1135
1:32:28,83 --> 1:32:33,27
Trust.  John, I hope that earns your
forgiveness for the votes we probably


1136
1:32:33,27 --> 1:32:38,43
secured to defeat your conservation 
easement legislation 25 years ago.


1137
1:32:38,43 --> 1:32:42,71
But uh, one of the issues you 
have touched on a little bit here


1138
1:32:42,71 --> 1:32:46,55
in the last question.  It seems
 that one the real distance


1139
1:32:46,55 --> 1:32:52,52
settings to collaboration today is
uh the litigation process and


1140
1:32:52,52 --> 1:32:56,43
I don't mean litigation to solve
substantive issues, which hopefully


1141
1:32:56,43 --> 1:33:0,9
sometimes the wisdom of our judges
can do, but process litigation,


1142
1:33:0,9 --> 1:33:7,98
where it seems to be to some degree
on all sides.  Uh, I might not get


1143
1:33:7,98 --> 1:33:10,68
what I want, but I can sure keep
you from getting what you want.


1144
1:33:10,68 --> 1:33:14,77
Uh, all I have to do is file a lawsuit
contending that some agency didn't


1145
1:33:14,77 --> 1:33:18,58
completely follow the process and
I'll stymie the works for another


1146
1:33:18,58 --> 1:33:21,88
4 or 5 years and I'll have the satisfaction
of knowing you didn't get what you


1147
1:33:21,88 --> 1:33:26,87
wanted.  How do we address that and
remove that as a distance setting, so


1148
1:33:26,87 --> 1:33:32,83
unless there are series legal issues,
we we as whatever side we represent,


1149
1:33:32,83 --> 1:33:38,59
can look at an issue and say, my
best bet on getting this resolved or


1150
1:33:38,59 --> 1:33:41,76
at least come out to some degree with 
something I can live with is through the


1151
1:33:41,76 --> 1:33:45,83
collaborative process, not through 
uh hiring one of these wonderful


1152
1:33:45,83 --> 1:33:48,1
attorneys and showing up in the court room.


1153
1:33:48,1 --> 1:33:51,11
Bill Ruckelshaus
One one of the reasons one of the ways


1154
1:33:51,11 --> 1:33:57,1
of doing that is an awareness of what 
you just said.  We had uh a statement


1155
1:33:57,1 --> 1:34:1,64
by Al earlier that rightness was
a problem in trying to solve some


1156
1:34:1,64 --> 1:34:6,36
of these things.  Actually when people
have been in court for 10 years


1157
1:34:6,36 --> 1:34:11,1
and spent 100s of thousands of dollars
on legal fees, and maybe reach 10%


1158
1:34:11,1 --> 1:34:15,68
of the resolution of all of the problems
that exists, that is ripe for collaboration.


1159
1:34:15,68 --> 1:34:19,47
People get discouraged after awhile
when they're fighting each other


1160
1:34:19,47 --> 1:34:23,88
and not getting anywhere.  And they
have this sense of we're winning


1161
1:34:23,88 --> 1:34:27,31
we're winning we're winning we lost,
how did I get there?  And and even


1162
1:34:27,31 --> 1:34:32,38
though they have won in the lawsuit
it's probably less than 10 or 15%


1163
1:34:32,38 --> 1:34:37,4
of what they need to to ultimately
 achieve it.  And once people come to that


1164
1:34:37,4 --> 1:34:40,46
conclusion they often look for 
collaboration as a way of trying to


1165
1:34:40,46 --> 1:34:43,99
resolve their disputes and recognize that 
they have to harmonize their interests


1166
1:34:43,99 --> 1:34:48,32
with others. which makes it more
likely they'll be successful in


1167
1:34:48,32 --> 1:34:53,87
a collaboration than before.  So
issue can be over ripe, they get,


1168
1:34:53,87 --> 1:34:57,2
people get so mad at each other they
can't talk to one another, but they


1169
1:34:57,2 --> 1:35:3,8
can also get exhausted by trying
the other approaches to uh resolution


1170
1:35:3,8 --> 1:35:5,37
of our disputed and be 
ready for collaboration.


1171
1:35:5,37 --> 1:35:7,6
Mike Sullivan
I think Jim's concern is he just


1172
1:35:7,6 --> 1:35:9,61
can't live that long!
[Laughter]


1173
1:35:9,61 --> 1:35:12,14
Bill Ruckelshaus
Me either, be we can at least start it.


1174
1:35:12,14 --> 1:35:16,6
Alan Simpson
Jim Magagna, uh worked with his


1175
1:35:16,6 --> 1:35:20,5
industry in the wool growers,
and it was a privilege to try to


1176
1:35:20,5 --> 1:35:24,83
help and launch occasions but this
guy is so steady and he doesn't


1177
1:35:24,83 --> 1:35:30,55
get caught in, he's really trying,
and and it is so true it's, I want


1178
1:35:30,55 --> 1:35:34,29
to deny you the pleasure of getting
what you want and I know that I'll


1179
1:35:34,29 --> 1:35:38,8
probably lose but I know that I can
screw you up for 2 or 3 or 4 years.


1180
1:35:38,8 --> 1:35:42,13
What a wonderful trait!
[Laughter]


1181
1:35:42,13 --> 1:35:44,42
Boy, it's really out there and


1182
1:35:44,42 --> 1:35:49,99
it's so vivid and disgusting, and
they pr- they they they preen about


1183
1:35:49,99 --> 1:35:53,76
it.  They're very proud of the fact
that they stomped this by simply


1184
1:35:53,76 --> 1:35:57,99
filing the suit and then when they
lose at every level they just keep


1185
1:35:57,99 --> 1:36:1,56
appealing and appealing, there's
nothing appealing about them!


1186
1:36:1,56 --> 1:36:3,97
Male Speaker
I think Dominic's comment made me


1187
1:36:3,97 --> 1:36:10,2
think for a moment that most most 
folks most citizens most voters know


1188
1:36:10,2 --> 1:36:14,51
what they know about complex issues 
from their interest groups that they're


1189
1:36:14,51 --> 1:36:19,24
part of, but yet most folks aren't part 
of those interest groups.  Most voters and


1190
1:36:19,24 --> 1:36:23,19
most citizens are highly confused.
 The media is the only way they


1191
1:36:23,19 --> 1:36:26,84
learn what's going on and they
don't learn much, because as Al


1192
1:36:26,84 --> 1:36:33,41
Simpson has pointed out nationally,
uh uh the media thrives on polarization.


1193
1:36:33,41 --> 1:36:37,54
I had a news director tell me one
time, nobody's interested in a message


1194
1:36:37,54 --> 1:36:41,16
from the muddled middle.  Well, the
muddled middle is where everything


1195
1:36:41,16 --> 1:36:48,45
gets done!  And I wonder if, as 
collaboration moves forward, if it did,


1196
1:36:48,45 --> 1:36:54,6
if if those who are collaborating did 
a better job of reaching out to the


1197
1:36:54,6 --> 1:36:57,8
levers of medium.  And talking about
what they're doing, what they're


1198
1:36:57,8 --> 1:37:1,29
actually getting accomplished.  If
that might help quell some of the


1199
1:37:1,29 --> 1:37:5,86
noisy rabble on the right and on
the left who are uh dragging the


1200
1:37:5,86 --> 1:37:9,1
dragging people's confidence in our
political process right into the


1201
1:37:9,1 --> 1:37:13,93
mud.  What Al was able to do is Simpson
bowls got the whole country talking


1202
1:37:13,93 --> 1:37:17,56
about the possibility, the possibility
that we could deal with the defect.


1203
1:37:17,56 --> 1:37:20,81
And it was the first time anybody
did.  You have a yahoo on the right


1204
1:37:20,81 --> 1:37:24,42
or the left showing up on the evening
news, you had senator Simpson and


1205
1:37:24,42 --> 1:37:26,61
Erston Bowls talking about 
what was actually possible.


1206
1:37:26,61 --> 1:37:30,29
Mike Sullivan
 That yahoo on the right [Laughter]


1207
1:37:30,29 --> 1:37:31,66
Panel Member
Depending on which one you have!


1208
1:37:31,66 --> 1:37:33,85
Male Speaker
 But anyway.  The point, has to do


1209
1:37:33,85 --> 1:37:37,5
with trying to the point has to do with 
recognizing through the course of


1210
1:37:37,5 --> 1:37:41,82
collaboration that outreach uh through
 the media uh being aggressive about


1211
1:37:41,82 --> 1:37:44,19
it may yield tremendous benefits.


1212
1:37:44,19 --> 1:37:47,47
John Turner
But it's really a a superb observation.


1213
1:37:47,47 --> 1:37:53,34
Uh the media has a real role to
play.  And uh I've accused of often


1214
1:37:53,34 --> 1:37:57,76
being lazy.  And maybe it's just
cause they're spread so thin, but


1215
1:37:57,76 --> 1:38:2,45
most of these, many of these resources
issues, are difficult because they're


1216
1:38:2,45 --> 1:38:9,75
complex.  And and so to get the information
out correctly, it's easy to do the


1217
1:38:9,75 --> 1:38:12,75
sexy thing, get a quote here, get
a quote there.  The public still


1218
1:38:12,75 --> 1:38:16,22
doesn't know what in the hell's going
on.  That's one of the things Bill


1219
1:38:16,22 --> 1:38:22,77
started out talking how a university
then, can be a pretty good watering


1220
1:38:22,77 --> 1:38:29,49
hole just to provide basic information.
 Uh on an issue uh the tools,


1221
1:38:29,49 --> 1:38:33,98
the issues, the science to date.
 So a university can do that.  Plus


1222
1:38:33,98 --> 1:38:38,29
a group should try to see that, what
are the facts that we agree on,


1223
1:38:38,29 --> 1:38:43,94
the challenges and the opportunities
and then make an effort to get that


1224
1:38:43,94 --> 1:38:50,28
to the media, uh and have a spokesman
trusted by all sides that can talk to


1225
1:38:50,28 --> 1:38:55,23
the media uh.  It was one of the
most frustrating things I encountered


1226
1:38:55,23 --> 1:39:0,9
with the Northern Spotted Owl, which
was very complex.  You turned on


1227
1:39:0,9 --> 1:39:5,9
the national news and you'd be interviewing
somebody that was just a bird addict,


1228
1:39:5,9 --> 1:39:8,72
that worshiped spotted owls, then
some poor guy afraid he was about


1229
1:39:8,72 --> 1:39:13,59
to have his mill shut down and lose
his job.  That became the issue,


1230
1:39:13,59 --> 1:39:21,5
how you got all the critical aspects
of uh the spotted owl issue out


1231
1:39:21,5 --> 1:39:24,67
to the press.  Getting them to take
the time to look at those issues


1232
1:39:24,67 --> 1:39:26,62
it's a good point.


1233
1:39:26,62 --> 1:39:29,45
Bill Ruckelshaus
Now I I think it's an excellent point.


1234
1:39:29,45 --> 1:39:32,77
And I think there ought to be built
into one of these uh collaborative


1235
1:39:32,77 --> 1:39:37,9
process, uh a desire to assess how
do we get this, let's assume we


1236
1:39:37,9 --> 1:39:41,81
come to some resolution of the issue.
 How do we get that resolution to


1237
1:39:41,81 --> 1:39:45,69
and the approach that we took to
get there out in front of the public


1238
1:39:45,69 --> 1:39:49,47
in such a way that they see these
problems can be grappled with.


1239
1:39:49,47 --> 1:39:52,31
Maybe we don't understand every aspect
of it, but look at these people


1240
1:39:52,31 --> 1:39:56,15
who've been fighting each other for
years have sat-sat down and worked out


1241
1:39:56,15 --> 1:40:0,2
their differences and have now come
forward.  I don't think that will


1242
1:40:0,2 --> 1:40:3,85
happen automatically I think we make
a concerted effort then the process


1243
1:40:3,85 --> 1:40:7,9
itself to insure that the results
are communicated we'll have a better


1244
1:40:7,9 --> 1:40:10,17
chance of of getting the right kind
of result.


1245
1:40:10,17 --> 1:40:13,78
Mike Sillivan
Al, you're an expert at the at the media.


1246
1:40:13,78 --> 1:40:18,48
What your response?    [Laughter]


1247
1:40:18,48 --> 1:40:20,42
Alan Simpson
I've always had the very sick idea


1248
1:40:20,42 --> 1:40:24,93
that the First Amendment belonged
to me too.  And when you knock on


1249
1:40:24,93 --> 1:40:28,79
them, then they shriek like gut shot
panthers. It's wonderful to watch.


1250
1:40:28,79 --> 1:40:32,69
Because they'll say, it's just the 
public's right to know.  I say, yeah,


1251
1:40:32,69 --> 1:40:37,97
it's the public's right to know something 
that's real.  Uh not rumor and crap and just


1252
1:40:37,97 --> 1:40:43,45
garbage, that's the public's right to 
know and then, always, I love the phrase


1253
1:40:43,45 --> 1:40:47,56
"We stick by our story."  That just
is a ritual, usually with violin


1254
1:40:47,56 --> 1:40:51,58
music in the background!  After they've
hammered you flat, all erroneous,


1255
1:40:51,58 --> 1:40:56,23
and and fake, and they say, we stick
to our story, our editorial board


1256
1:40:56,23 --> 1:40:59,74
has decided that Simpson is a kook
and we've got to drive him out.


1257
1:40:59,74 --> 1:41:4,96
Lemme tell you.  An attack unanswered
is an attack believed.  I've always


1258
1:41:4,96 --> 1:41:9,2
lived that way, I've always took
them on.  But I tell you, they're


1259
1:41:9,2 --> 1:41:15,66
interested in confusion, controversy,
and complexity, not clarity and


1260
1:41:15,66 --> 1:41:22,63
lemme tell you.  If you watch stuff,
Charlie Rose and Jim Lair, you have


1261
1:41:22,63 --> 1:41:27,8
to bring your own brains to those
sections.  There are staff members


1262
1:41:27,8 --> 1:41:30,71
who will not allow their senator
or congressman to do those because


1263
1:41:30,71 --> 1:41:35,43
it's twenty minutes.  And their brain
and their mouth is only done for


1264
1:41:35,43 --> 1:41:40,1
sound bites!  And they know just
exactly what to use so they can


1265
1:41:40,1 --> 1:41:44,56
then go back and say he was on the
news last night, usually babbling,


1266
1:41:44,56 --> 1:41:49,26
you know, 30 seconds worth, and you
you couldn't get people to go on,


1267
1:41:49,26 --> 1:41:53,62
their staff wouldn't let them go
on Jim Lair or Charlie Rose because


1268
1:41:53,62 --> 1:41:56,99
you had to sit there for 20 or 30
minutes and answer questions with


1269
1:41:56,99 --> 1:42:2,71
nobody around to shovel papers to
you.  It's a vacuous group.  They're


1270
1:42:2,71 --> 1:42:7,2
there for re-election.  We're at a
crossroads now in America between


1271
1:42:7,2 --> 1:42:12,29
cowardice and greed.  Cowardice of
the legislators, and greed of those


1272
1:42:12,29 --> 1:42:15,87
people who don't want to do anything
to that tax code, and it only helps


1273
1:42:15,87 --> 1:42:19,41
really 10% of the American people.
 Look like I've never heard of that


1274
1:42:19,41 --> 1:42:23,97
stuff in there.  Abandon mine land
reclamation.  Lord save you don't


1275
1:42:23,97 --> 1:42:28,58
want to oppose my own delegation, but
when you use it to on the auditorium


1276
1:42:28,58 --> 1:42:32,34
at the University of Wyoming, that
ain't exactly mine land reclamation.


1277
1:42:32,34 --> 1:42:36,4
So we have to dig into this stuff.
 And when you do you get hammered


1278
1:42:36,4 --> 1:42:43,2
flat and then the media will always
come up with some wrenching story,


1279
1:42:43,2 --> 1:42:48,52
some some probative thing I talked
to a wonderful young gal in Cody


1280
1:42:48,52 --> 1:42:52,3
who just graduated from Columbia
Journalism School, that's one of


1281
1:42:52,3 --> 1:42:54,11
the best. I said, what are you going
to do now?  She said, I'm going


1282
1:42:54,11 --> 1:42:57,42
to be one of the hunters.  I said,
what are you going to hunt?  She


1283
1:42:57,42 --> 1:43:3,61
said, people like you.  That's, that's
her new you know she'll do a good


1284
1:43:3,61 --> 1:43:8,49
job.  She's bright and and but you
know.  If every person in public


1285
1:43:8,49 --> 1:43:13,98
life is an adulterer, a rotten crook,
corrupt, if every person in the


1286
1:43:13,98 --> 1:43:19,24
media is a drudge, this guy, that
guy, then we all get tainted with


1287
1:43:19,24 --> 1:43:24,96
that.  I would think that unless the
unless politicians and journalists


1288
1:43:24,96 --> 1:43:29,34
get together and decide that they
are worthy parts of society, this


1289
1:43:29,34 --> 1:43:35,57
society can't exist.  As as long as
people are disgusted with journalists


1290
1:43:35,57 --> 1:43:40,8
and disgusted with politicians, you can't
hate politicians and love democracy,


1291
1:43:40,8 --> 1:43:44,6
and you can't hate journalists and
love the Second Amendment, the First


1292
1:43:44,6 --> 1:43:46,0
Amendment, the whole thing.


1293
1:43:46,0 --> 1:43:50,39
Jessica Clout
  Thank you very much.


1294
1:43:50,39 --> 1:43:53,31
Um I'm actually not really a member
of the public.  I've apologized


1295
1:43:53,31 --> 1:43:57,2
to my colleagues, I'm very fortunate
to just have joined the team at


1296
1:43:57,2 --> 1:44:0,48
the Ruckelshaus Institute and the
School of Environment and Natural


1297
1:44:0,48 --> 1:44:5,15
Resources.  Um and I will be working
on collaborative issues in Wyoming.


1298
1:44:5,15 --> 1:44:9,88
Um one thing I just wanted to bring
to your attention and ask you if


1299
1:44:9,88 --> 1:44:12,77
you have any experience in this,
and at this point I'm going to sit


1300
1:44:12,77 --> 1:44:18,62
down, um, I'm just, did I say my
name?  Jessica Clout. Um, there's


1301
1:44:18,62 --> 1:44:25,44
also this idea of collaborative learning.
 In natural resources we don't always


1302
1:44:25,44 --> 1:44:30,18
have to get to the table with the
expectation that we come to a resolution.


1303
1:44:30,18 --> 1:44:34,84
That we, that we make a decision.
 We could also just come to the


1304
1:44:34,84 --> 1:44:41,64
table to learn.  And I have a lot
of experience in that.  And sometimes


1305
1:44:41,64 --> 1:44:45,76
it is precisely the issues, Bill,
that you were mentioning, that might,


1306
1:44:45,76 --> 1:44:51,63
you felt were too hot, that actually
might lend themselves to that kind


1307
1:44:51,63 --> 1:44:56,35
of approach, a collaborative learning
approach.  Because it it takes the


1308
1:44:56,35 --> 1:45:0,48
it takes a little bit of the heat
off.  And it might create an opportunity


1309
1:45:0,48 --> 1:45:4,59
for people to just come to the table,
hear each other, learn from each


1310
1:45:4,59 --> 1:45:9,49
other, and if a decision can result
from that they'll find out.  But


1311
1:45:9,49 --> 1:45:14,18
in the meantime, more is learned
and it's not just the uh the speaking


1312
1:45:14,18 --> 1:45:18,37
people, it's it's some of a the people
here we're referring to.  It's not


1313
1:45:18,37 --> 1:45:22,24
always the same voices.  And I was wondering
 if you'd had any experience with that.


1314
1:45:22,24 --> 1:45:25,28
Bill Ruckelshaus
Let me give you an example.  I I think


1315
1:45:25,28 --> 1:45:29,4
that's a very good point.  There is a, 
there're skeptics, about collaborative


1316
1:45:29,4 --> 1:45:33,78
processes who say they're endless and
 they never come to a resolution and


1317
1:45:33,78 --> 1:45:37,62
they don't come to some final
 conclusion, and that therefore I don't


1318
1:45:37,62 --> 1:45:41,63
want to participate in.  So you've got
to be careful about that.  But we


1319
1:45:41,63 --> 1:45:45,94
had an experience at the beginning
of the Institute, uh it it's been


1320
1:45:45,94 --> 1:45:50,33
almost 16 years ago now, but the
Safe Drinking Water Act was coming


1321
1:45:50,33 --> 1:45:54,6
up for re-authorization by the congress,
Senator Kempthorne from the neighboring


1322
1:45:54,6 --> 1:45:58,99
state of Idaho was the head of of
the Subcommittee on the Environment


1323
1:45:58,99 --> 1:46:2,85
and Public Work Committee that was
looking at it, in in order to educate


1324
1:46:2,85 --> 1:46:7,38
the board about the nature of collaborative
processes, he took the Safe Drinking


1325
1:46:7,38 --> 1:46:10,66
Water Act and said, supposing this
was something we needed to come


1326
1:46:10,66 --> 1:46:14,63
to a conclusion about, how would
we do it?  And we spent two days,


1327
1:46:14,63 --> 1:46:18,93
I didn't think we'd come close to
resolving the issues in there, and


1328
1:46:18,93 --> 1:46:22,98
we came to a conclusion.  There there
were probably 25 people there about


1329
1:46:22,98 --> 1:46:26,85
what the Safe Drinking Water Act
Amendment should say.  They were


1330
1:46:26,85 --> 1:46:31,81
causing tow towns like Torrington
in a Wyoming to close down because


1331
1:46:31,81 --> 1:46:35,35
they couldn't afford the kind of
filtration systems that were mandated


1332
1:46:35,35 --> 1:46:40,48
under the law.  We we reach an accommodation
on this a lot of the disparate kind


1333
1:46:40,48 --> 1:46:45,31
of people represented on the board.
 I took the results to Senator Kempthorne,


1334
1:46:45,31 --> 1:46:49,23
uh in the Senate a couple of weeks
later, he said, how did you get


1335
1:46:49,23 --> 1:46:52,67
all these people to agree to this?
 I said, well we just sat down and


1336
1:46:52,67 --> 1:46:56,76
discussed the issues and and everybody
had their mind open, and listened


1337
1:46:56,76 --> 1:46:59,55
to one another and talked to one
another, and we came to this conclusion.


1338
1:46:59,55 --> 1:47:3,13
He took our recommendations and
put them in front of his committee


1339
1:47:3,13 --> 1:47:6,78
and they essentially became the law,
essentially what the Safe Drinking


1340
1:47:6,78 --> 1:47:12,2
Water Act says now.  So it is possible
to try something like this and just


1341
1:47:12,2 --> 1:47:16,67
for purposes of exchanging information
find you can find common ground.


1342
1:47:16,67 --> 1:47:22,47
And then in this case just from
kind of dumb luck, but we were here


1343
1:47:22,47 --> 1:47:25,62
and he was ready for something like
this and we presented it to him


1344
1:47:25,62 --> 1:47:32,72
with a a a broad degree of a of
 a representation and consensus.


1345
1:47:32,72 --> 1:47:37,27
He was not able to get on his 
committee he essentially used


1346
1:47:37,27 --> 1:47:39,92
that and it became the law.


1347
1:47:39,92 --> 1:47:43,65
John Turner
I I think the observation on collaborative


1348
1:47:43,65 --> 1:47:47,77
learning is is a good one.  I think
anybody we look at in the political


1349
1:47:47,77 --> 1:47:52,18
arena, or nonprofit, or industry,
or whatever that's been affected,


1350
1:47:52,18 --> 1:47:56,45
maybe by experience they've learned
to listen to other people and work


1351
1:47:56,45 --> 1:48:0,34
with them and accommodate them uh
I can think of so many examples


1352
1:48:0,34 --> 1:48:4,35
in my life as a legislator where
I had a great idea, and if people


1353
1:48:4,35 --> 1:48:8,3
would just do it the way I had figured
it out we'd have it solved.


1354
1:48:8,3 --> 1:48:10,86
[Laughter]
Simpson would screw around with it,


1355
1:48:10,86 --> 1:48:15,78
or Governor Sullivan, or the stock growers, or
somebody would say, hell no, Turner,


1356
1:48:15,78 --> 1:48:20,34
but maybe if you we could accommodate
this or that.  And again and again


1357
1:48:20,34 --> 1:48:24,97
I said, you know, if I hadn't listened
and worked, there were things I


1358
1:48:24,97 --> 1:48:29,41
hadn't thought of, others' people's
 concerns, and one of the good,


1359
1:48:29,41 --> 1:48:32,36
great things about the University
Program that we've all been involved


1360
1:48:32,36 --> 1:48:37,6
in is collaborative learning in the
University.  And it it really is


1361
1:48:37,6 --> 1:48:43,0
something to watch, where you take
a students in diverse a disciplines,


1362
1:48:43,0 --> 1:48:48,76
a law student, a kid in energy, a
kid business, uh a kid from wildlife,


1363
1:48:48,76 --> 1:48:54,23
uh and and put them together in a
core group and they all have their


1364
1:48:54,23 --> 1:48:57,32
own slants.  Somebody's interested
in business, somebody's interested


1365
1:48:57,32 --> 1:49:0,32
in engineering, and you and you bring
these kids together, you provide


1366
1:49:0,32 --> 1:49:5,38
them a lot of information, and they've
got to solve a real uh resource


1367
1:49:5,38 --> 1:49:10,15
issue.  Uh energy extraction in the
Upper Green, or a major highway


1368
1:49:10,15 --> 1:49:13,67
or something, and they all gotta
duke it out and learn from one another


1369
1:49:13,67 --> 1:49:18,81
and it's a whole semester.  Uh and Dr.
Burke and others can provide more


1370
1:49:18,81 --> 1:49:24,84
information, but it's called uh Capstone,
and I've had the opportunity to


1371
1:49:24,84 --> 1:49:28,5
just go down and speak to these kids,
and boy they're thoughtful and innovative


1372
1:49:28,5 --> 1:49:31,81
and knocking heads and learning from
one another and those are the life


1373
1:49:31,81 --> 1:49:36,6
skills that are going to make these,
when they go into the private sector


1374
1:49:36,6 --> 1:49:40,45
or government or nonprofit or their
own business, they're going to develop


1375
1:49:40,45 --> 1:49:44,99
some pretty neat skills in how to
work with other people.  So collaborative


1376
1:49:44,99 --> 1:49:49,59
learning is such a a vital tool in
helping anybody interested in these


1377
1:49:49,59 --> 1:49:51,77
processes.  How does that seem?


1378
1:49:51,77 --> 1:49:54,43
Alan Simpson
I think the toughest problem


1379
1:49:54,43 --> 1:49:57,1
is the people that are there have
seen so many of these things fail,


1380
1:49:57,1 --> 1:50:1,11
they in the elephant graveyard,
they say, well, here's Turner, he


1381
1:50:1,11 --> 1:50:5,49
showed up, here's Ruckelshaus, Simpson,
Sullivan, they tried that 10 years


1382
1:50:5,49 --> 1:50:9,8
ago, just give it up.  You never
want to believe that.  You just


1383
1:50:9,8 --> 1:50:13,67
have to use continual perseverance,
keep coming at them, they'll say,


1384
1:50:13,67 --> 1:50:16,51
don't appoint another commission,
they've never done anything.  Well


1385
1:50:16,51 --> 1:50:19,53
let me tell you I've been on 3 that
have done a lot.  I remember Immigration


1386
1:50:19,53 --> 1:50:24,66
and Refugee Policy with father Ted
Hessler, Kennedy, bunch of us.


1387
1:50:24,66 --> 1:50:29,8
We did a legal immigration bill and
an illegal immigration bill, didn't


1388
1:50:29,8 --> 1:50:32,81
work cause we couldn't get a more
secure identifier, because the right


1389
1:50:32,81 --> 1:50:38,3
and the left said, that this is a
national ID card.  That's how you


1390
1:50:38,3 --> 1:50:43,95
get things done.  Don't forget. 
The triggers, enrage, emotion, and


1391
1:50:43,95 --> 1:50:48,46
then you did the Iraq Study Group,
we agreed with every word, 5 Dems,


1392
1:50:48,46 --> 1:50:52,91
5 Republicans, the last administration
accepted about 5 of them, since


1393
1:50:52,91 --> 1:50:57,3
then 59 of them have been adopted
as to what we suggested you do.


1394
1:50:57,3 --> 1:51:1,75
And now this hideous thing that
Furston and I are involved in.


1395
1:51:1,75 --> 1:51:5,92
It doesn't matter what you call it,
it ain't going away!  It's out there!


1396
1:51:5,92 --> 1:51:11,98
And this country is headed for some
terribly tough time.  To think I


1397
1:51:11,98 --> 1:51:16,1
said to Anne, I've never been more
energized, and she said, why is


1398
1:51:16,1 --> 1:51:20,8
that, I said, because at 81 now,
I have achieved life's ultimate goal.


1399
1:51:20,8 --> 1:51:36,8
I have pissed off everyone in America! 
[Laughter/ Applause]


1400
1:51:36,8 --> 1:51:37,59
Mike Sullivan
Do any of the panelists have any


1401
1:51:37,59 --> 1:51:42,41
that that you have left unsaid?
[Laughter}


1402
1:51:42,41 --> 1:51:43,33
Bill Ruckelshaus
I mean, I think Alan is


1403
1:51:43,33 --> 1:51:48,29
right though, I think he has 
pissed off everybody. [Laughter]


1404
1:51:48,29 --> 1:51:49,88
Mike Sullivan
Well....


1405
1:51:49,88 --> 1:51:51,45
John Turner
Thank you all!


1406
1:51:51,45 --> 1:51:54,52
Mike Sullivan
Thank thanks to the audience. [Apause]


1407
1:51:54,52 --> 1:52:53,51
Music


1408
1:52:53,51 --> 1:54:53,51
