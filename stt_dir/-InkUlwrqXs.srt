BEEFY: Mate, I'm starving.


3
0:0:29,623 --> 0:0:30,55
NATHAN: Tell me about it.


4
0:0:30,55 --> 0:0:31,49
What have you got?


5
0:0:31,49 --> 0:0:32,8
BEEFY: Burger.


6
0:0:32,8 --> 0:0:33,42
NATHAN: Oh, man.


7
0:0:33,42 --> 0:0:34,69
Ha.


8
0:0:34,69 --> 0:0:35,68
BEEFY: What?


9
0:0:35,68 --> 0:0:36,2
NATHAN: Hey.


10
0:0:36,2 --> 0:0:37,58
BEEFY: What are you
mean about?


11
0:0:37,58 --> 0:0:38,0
NATHAN: OK.


12
0:0:38,0 --> 0:0:38,64
Right.


13
0:0:38,64 --> 0:0:40,15
You ain't going to believe this,
because I didn't believe


14
0:0:40,15 --> 0:0:41,13
it at first.


15
0:0:41,13 --> 0:0:42,85
But I swear it's true,
'cause Ash said he


16
0:0:42,85 --> 0:0:43,44
heard the same thing.


17
0:0:43,44 --> 0:0:45,16
BEEFY: What are you talking
to Ash for, man?


18
0:0:45,16 --> 0:0:45,89
NATHAN: Look, you know
that kid who got


19
0:0:45,89 --> 0:0:47,14
stabbed last month?


20
0:0:47,14 --> 0:0:49,92



21
0:0:49,92 --> 0:0:50,35
BEEFY: Yeah.


22
0:0:50,35 --> 0:0:50,635
I heard about it.


23
0:0:50,635 --> 0:0:51,92
But I didn't know him.


24
0:0:51,92 --> 0:0:53,632
NATHAN: Yeah, but you heard
about it, right?


25
0:0:53,632 --> 0:0:54,34
BEEFY: Yeah.


26
0:0:54,34 --> 0:0:56,42
NATHAN: Well, anyway, after he
got stabbed, the guys who


27
0:0:56,42 --> 0:0:58,5
stabbed him let him get away.


28
0:0:58,5 --> 0:0:59,35
Too busy arguing like idiots.


29
0:0:59,35 --> 0:1:3,98



30
0:1:3,98 --> 0:1:5,63
So the stabbed kid, you know,
he's trying to get away, but


31
0:1:5,63 --> 0:1:7,29
there's no where
for him to go.


32
0:1:7,29 --> 0:1:8,35
So he's stumbling down
that alleyway.


33
0:1:8,35 --> 0:1:10,68
You know, one arm pushed against
his wound like that.


34
0:1:10,68 --> 0:1:12,67
And as he looks behind him,
they're all there,


35
0:1:12,67 --> 0:1:13,92
coming after him.


36
0:1:13,92 --> 0:1:16,57



37
0:1:16,57 --> 0:1:18,55
So he turns a corner, and
he sees the bright


38
0:1:18,55 --> 0:1:19,8
lights of this place.


39
0:1:19,8 --> 0:1:23,848



40
0:1:23,848 --> 0:1:26,81



41
0:1:26,81 --> 0:1:27,69
He stumbles in.


42
0:1:27,69 --> 0:1:29,27
He's fallen behind
the counter.


43
0:1:29,27 --> 0:1:30,74
But now, he's leaking
like a tap.


44
0:1:30,74 --> 0:1:32,5
Blood everywhere.


45
0:1:32,5 --> 0:1:38,46



46
0:1:38,46 --> 0:1:38,51
BEEFY: No way.


47
0:1:38,51 --> 0:1:39,36
This place?


48
0:1:39,36 --> 0:1:39,79
NATHAN: Yeah.


49
0:1:39,79 --> 0:1:40,475
This place.


50
0:1:40,475 --> 0:1:42,56
I mean, the kebab guy, he didn't
know what was going on.


51
0:1:42,56 --> 0:1:43,96
He didn't know whether to help
him or chuck him out.

And?


56
0:1:49,88 --> 0:1:50,11
NATHAN: Right.


57
0:1:50,11 --> 0:1:52,8
So now, the gang bursts through
the doors, and they're


58
0:1:52,8 --> 0:1:53,568
looking to finish him off.


59
0:1:53,568 --> 0:1:55,2
-What the fuck are you
looking at, man?


60
0:1:55,2 --> 0:1:55,958
Move.


61
0:1:55,958 --> 0:1:56,44
BEEFY: Wait.


62
0:1:56,44 --> 0:1:57,17
This really happened here?


63
0:1:57,17 --> 0:1:57,48
NATHAN: Yeah.


64
0:1:57,48 --> 0:1:57,85
It gets worse.


65
0:1:57,85 --> 0:1:59,6
Look, I'm telling you.


66
0:1:59,6 --> 0:2:1,12
They started giving it real
big to the kebab guy.


67
0:2:1,12 --> 0:2:2,11
You know, telling him to get out
of the way so they could


68
0:2:2,11 --> 0:2:3,152
get to the kid.


69
0:2:3,152 --> 0:2:4,76
-Move.


70
0:2:4,76 --> 0:2:5,462
-Get out of the fucking
way, man.


71
0:2:5,462 --> 0:2:7,31
Are you mad?


72
0:2:7,31 --> 0:2:9,419
NATHAN: What do you think
the owner's done?


73
0:2:9,419 --> 0:2:10,399
BEEFY: I don't know.


74
0:2:10,399 --> 0:2:12,34
NATHAN: Well, they didn't take
too kindly to it, you see.


75
0:2:12,34 --> 0:2:13,63
Some fuckers running in
there with knives


76
0:2:13,63 --> 0:2:15,9
out looking for trouble.


77
0:2:15,9 --> 0:2:16,0
They've had enough
of that shit.


78
0:2:16,0 --> 0:2:18,72
They're probably from some
war-torn country, you know?


79
0:2:18,72 --> 0:2:20,13
Seeing shit me and you
wouldn't believe.


80
0:2:20,13 --> 0:2:23,4
So he picks up a knife.


81
0:2:23,4 --> 0:2:25,37
I ain't talking about
no pocket knife.


82
0:2:25,37 --> 0:2:27,553
I'm talking about a big,
motherfucking knife.


83
0:2:27,553 --> 0:2:28,26
BEEFY: Shit man.


84
0:2:28,26 --> 0:2:30,84
That's some "Crocodile
Dundee" shit.


85
0:2:30,84 --> 0:2:31,69
NATHAN: Exactly.


86
0:2:31,69 --> 0:2:33,615
And the other two workers,
they got two knives.


87
0:2:33,615 --> 0:2:37,8
And it's three on three.


88
0:2:37,8 --> 0:3:8,277

0:3:8,277 --> 0:3:9,65
BEEFY: What the hell happens?


90
0:3:9,65 --> 0:3:10,975
NATHAN: What happens?


91
0:3:10,975 --> 0:3:12,9
Oh, come on.


92
0:3:12,9 --> 0:3:13,34
Use your imagination.

your face.

it for longer.
