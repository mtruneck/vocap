0:0:16,191 --> 0:0:18,426
Hi everybody.
Feel like I'm in a revival.


2
0:0:18,426 --> 0:0:21,311
This is great.


3
0:0:21,311 --> 0:0:25,786
It's great to be back in my old
stomping grounds of San Francisco.


4
0:0:25,786 --> 0:0:29,696
When I graduated UCLA,
I moved to Northern California


5
0:0:29,696 --> 0:0:33,902
and I lived in a little town called
Elk on the Mendocino coast.


6
0:0:33,902 --> 0:0:38,281
And I didn't have a phone
or TV, but I had US mail.


7
0:0:38,281 --> 0:0:42,687
And life was good back then
if you could remember it.


8
0:0:42,687 --> 0:0:46,61
I'd go to the general store for
a cup of coffee and a brownie.


9
0:0:46,61 --> 0:0:50,675
And I'd ship my film to
San Francisco, and low and behold,


10
0:0:50,675 --> 0:0:53,911
two days later it would
end up on my front door,


11
0:0:53,911 --> 0:0:59,4
which was way better than having
to fight the traffic of Hollywood.


12
0:0:59,4 --> 0:1:2,88
I didn't have much money,


13
0:1:2,88 --> 0:1:5,746
but I had time and a sense of wonder.


14
0:1:5,746 --> 0:1:8,893
So I started shooting
time-lapse photography.


15
0:1:8,893 --> 0:1:12,995
It would take me a month to
shoot a four minutes roll of film


16
0:1:12,995 --> 0:1:15,958
because that's all I could afford.


17
0:1:15,958 --> 0:1:18,834
I've been shooting time-lapse
flowers continuously,


18
0:1:18,834 --> 0:1:23,62
non-stop, 24 hours a day,
7 days a week for over 30 years.


19
0:1:23,62 --> 0:1:28,467
And to see them move is a
dance I'll never get tired of.


20
0:1:28,467 --> 0:1:33,332
Their beauty immerses
us with color, taste, touch.


21
0:1:33,332 --> 0:1:39,152
It also provides a third
of the food we eat.


22
0:1:39,152 --> 0:1:43,43
Beauty and seduction is
nature's tools for survival


23
0:1:43,43 --> 0:1:46,182
because we protect
what we fall in love with.


24
0:1:46,182 --> 0:1:49,682
It opens our hearts and makes
us realize we are a part of nature


25
0:1:49,682 --> 0:1:53,25
and we're not separate from it.


26
0:1:53,25 --> 0:1:57,23
When we see ourselves in
nature, it also connects us


27
0:1:57,23 --> 0:2:2,66
to every one of us, because it's
clear that it's all connected in one.


28
0:2:2,66 --> 0:2:5,791
When people see my images
a lot of times they'll say,


29
0:2:5,791 --> 0:2:7,722
"Oh my God!"


30
0:2:7,722 --> 0:2:10,97
Have you ever wondered what that meant?


31
0:2:10,97 --> 0:2:15,88
The "Oh" means it caught your attention,
makes you present, makes you mindful.


32
0:2:15,88 --> 0:2:20,687
The "my" means it connects with
something deep inside your soul.


33
0:2:20,687 --> 0:2:25,187
It creates a gateway for your
inner voice to rise up and be heard.


34
0:2:25,187 --> 0:2:27,134
And "God",


35
0:2:27,134 --> 0:2:32,681
God is that personal journey we
all want to be on to be inspired,


36
0:2:32,681 --> 0:2:38,209
to feel like we're connected to
a Universe that celebrates life.


37
0:2:38,209 --> 0:2:40,907
Did you know that 80%


38
0:2:40,907 --> 0:2:44,485
of the information we receive
comes through our eyes?


39
0:2:44,485 --> 0:2:47,695
And if you compare light
energy to musical scales


40
0:2:47,695 --> 0:2:49,336
it would only be one octave


41
0:2:49,336 --> 0:2:52,939
that the naked eye can see,
which is right in the middle.


42
0:2:52,939 --> 0:2:55,882
And aren't we grateful
for our brains that can


43
0:2:55,882 --> 0:2:58,765
take this electrical impulse
that comes from light energy


44
0:2:58,765 --> 0:3:4,7
to create images in order
for us to explore our world?


45
0:3:4,7 --> 0:3:8,358
And aren't we grateful that we have
hearts that can feel these vibrations,


46
0:3:8,358 --> 0:3:11,984
in order for us to allow
ourselves to feel the pleasure


47
0:3:11,984 --> 0:3:18,81
and the beauty of nature?


48
0:3:18,81 --> 0:3:27,409
Nature's beauty is a gift that
cultivates appreciation and gratitude.


49
0:3:27,409 --> 0:3:30,373
So I have a gift I want
to share with you today.


50
0:3:30,373 --> 0:3:33,848
A project I'm working on called
"Happiness Revealed"


51
0:3:33,848 --> 0:3:36,935
and it'll give us a glimpse
into that perspective


52
0:3:36,935 --> 0:3:46,397
from the point of view of a child
and an elderly man of that world.


53
0:3:46,397 --> 0:3:51,301
(Video) Child: When I watch TV,


54
0:3:51,301 --> 0:3:56,759
It's just some shows that
you just, that are pretend,


55
0:3:56,759 --> 0:3:59,18
and when you explore,


56
0:3:59,18 --> 0:4:3,981
you get more imagination
than you already had.


57
0:4:3,981 --> 0:4:7,284
And, when you get more imagination,


58
0:4:7,284 --> 0:4:9,837
it makes you want to go deeper in,


59
0:4:9,837 --> 0:4:13,7
so you can get more,
and see beautifuler things.


60
0:4:13,7 --> 0:4:17,895
Like, it could, the path,
if it's a path it could lead you,


61
0:4:17,895 --> 0:4:20,421
it could lead you to
a beach or something,


62
0:4:20,421 --> 0:4:22,544
and it could be beautiful.


63
0:4:22,544 --> 0:4:51,285
(Instrumental music by Gary Malkin)


64
0:4:51,285 --> 0:4:57,863
David Steindl-Rast:
You think this is just another day in your life?


65
0:4:57,863 --> 0:5:0,647
It's not just another day.


66
0:5:0,647 --> 0:5:8,233
it's the one day that
is given to you today.


67
0:5:8,233 --> 0:5:11,22
It's given to you.


68
0:5:11,22 --> 0:5:14,297
It's a gift.


69
0:5:14,297 --> 0:5:18,335
It's the only gift that
you have right now,


70
0:5:18,335 --> 0:5:24,249
and the only appropriate
response is gratefulness.


71
0:5:24,249 --> 0:5:32,253
(Instrumental music)


72
0:5:32,253 --> 0:5:38,449
If you do nothing else but
to cultivate that response


73
0:5:38,449 --> 0:5:43,489
to the great gift
that this unique day is,


74
0:5:43,489 --> 0:5:49,974
if you learn to respond as if it
were the first day in your life,


75
0:5:49,974 --> 0:5:52,697
and the very last day,


76
0:5:52,697 --> 0:6:1,587
then you will have spent
this day very well.


77
0:6:1,587 --> 0:6:4,812
Begin by opening your
eyes and be surprised


78
0:6:4,812 --> 0:6:8,465
that you have eyes you can open.


79
0:6:8,465 --> 0:6:10,785
That incredible array of colors


80
0:6:10,785 --> 0:6:18,95
that is constantly offered
to us for pure enjoyment.


81
0:6:18,95 --> 0:6:21,622
Look at the sky.


82
0:6:21,622 --> 0:6:24,829
We so rarely look at the sky.


83
0:6:24,829 --> 0:6:31,237
We so rarely note how different
it is from moment to moment,


84
0:6:31,237 --> 0:6:35,4
with clouds coming and going.


85
0:6:35,4 --> 0:6:37,334
We just think of the weather.


86
0:6:37,334 --> 0:6:42,572
And even of the weather, we don't think
of all the many nuances of weather.


87
0:6:42,572 --> 0:6:46,89
We just think of good weather
and bad weather.


88
0:6:46,89 --> 0:6:51,555
This day, right now,
has unique weather,


89
0:6:51,555 --> 0:6:57,253
maybe a kind that will never
exactly in that form come again.


90
0:6:57,253 --> 0:7:4,314
The formation of clouds in the sky
will never be the same that is right now.


91
0:7:4,314 --> 0:7:10,138
Open your eyes. Look at that.


92
0:7:10,138 --> 0:7:14,938
Look at the faces
of people whom you meet.


93
0:7:14,938 --> 0:7:22,396
Each one has an incredible
story behind their face,


94
0:7:22,396 --> 0:7:28,578
a story that you could
never fully fathom.


95
0:7:28,578 --> 0:7:35,825
Not only their own story,
but the story of their ancestors.


96
0:7:35,825 --> 0:7:39,595
We all go back so far.


97
0:7:39,595 --> 0:7:43,586
And in this present moment, on this day,


98
0:7:43,586 --> 0:7:48,46
all the people you meet,
all that life from generations


99
0:7:48,46 --> 0:7:52,301
and from so many
places all over the world,


100
0:7:52,301 --> 0:7:56,64
flows together and meets you here


101
0:7:56,64 --> 0:8:9,679
like a life-giving water, if you
only open your heart and drink.


102
0:8:9,679 --> 0:8:16,624
Open your heart to the incredible
gifts that civilization gives to us.


103
0:8:16,624 --> 0:8:20,632
You flip a switch,
and there is electric light.


104
0:8:20,632 --> 0:8:25,982
You turn a faucet, and there
is warm water and cold water


105
0:8:25,982 --> 0:8:28,807
and drinkable water.


106
0:8:28,807 --> 0:8:35,758
It's a gift that millions and millions
in the world will never experience.


107
0:8:35,758 --> 0:8:41,7
So these are just a few of
an enormous number of gifts


108
0:8:41,7 --> 0:8:45,12
to which we can open your heart.


109
0:8:45,12 --> 0:8:50,842
And so I wish you that you would
open your heart to all these blessings


110
0:8:50,842 --> 0:8:54,475
and let them flow through you,


111
0:8:54,475 --> 0:9:1,857
that everyone whom you will meet
on this day will be blessed by you.


112
0:9:1,857 --> 0:9:5,128
Just by your eyes,


113
0:9:5,128 --> 0:9:8,909
by your smile,


114
0:9:8,909 --> 0:9:12,272
by your touch.


115
0:9:12,272 --> 0:9:16,719
Just by your presence.


116
0:9:16,719 --> 0:9:26,593
Let the gratefulness overflow
into blessing all around you.


117
0:9:26,593 --> 0:9:42,44
Then it will really be a good day.


118
0:9:42,44 --> 0:9:43,344
(Applause)


119
0:9:43,344 --> 0:9:45,783
Louie Schwartzberg: Thank you.


120
0:9:45,783 --> 0:9:47,486
Thank you very much.


121
0:9:47,486 --> 0:11:47,486
(Applause)
