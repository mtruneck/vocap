###0 thirty one-year-old woman in ireland uh... died after she had a miscarriage
###4 and doctors refuse to terminate the pregnancy uh... when she was about
###9 seventeen weeks pregnant she went into the hospital and complained about severe
###13 back pain
###14 and the doctors realized that she was miscarrying so she started asking them
###19 after an abortion because the pain was excruciating however out the fetus
###24 allegedly still had a heart beat
###26 and uh... the doctors told her that they would not uh... abort because they only
###30 abort in cases where the woman's life is in danger
###35 and so they they had not heard the abortion
###38 uh... few days later
###40 uh... it she died from something known is that set the senior
###43 and uh... it was a yuko live uh... infection that she had
###48 and you know she left behind a husband and their devastated and the fact that
###54 doctors denied her this abortion
###57 is just
###58 ridiculous it's ludicrous
###60 yet in
###61 this is a problem when we make decisions like this
###64 uh... that are not based
###66 on logical reason
###68 or even honest the humanity of the people say they do this for morality is
###72 this for al is this moral miss the muslim world we have ever heard doctor
###76 saying that they won't
###78 operate when she obviously even she was vomiting proper
###81 whole day she was an extreme pain obvious issue has and we pay
###86 long infection in the beginning to our meeting today in the right before so for
###89 us
###90 but that by the end of the baby was in a survive anyway
###93 she asks for an abortion multiple times and he she was desperate at one point
###98 com she was fully dilated
###100 uh... and and feed the miscarriage it shoes in the process of having a
###104 miscarriage and she asked for them to you know opal abort you know get get
###109 this out of my body
###110 uh... and the doctors told her it only take a few minutes just you know just
###114 wait it out
###115 uh... as she was you know japan meeting and the arctic fluid it was an issue
###119 isn't horrible condition and they still denied what she asks for and out her
###124 husband says that doctors told her uh... i'm sorry the doctor said that you know
###128 this is a catholic hospitals
###130 and that's what the long island that's the law yeah
###134 uh... and at the husband says i had neither irish nor catholic
###138 but they said there was nothing they could do
###141 this vessel exactly what's wrong with this
###143 why are you putting your morality on me
###146 begin this to my wife
###148 hinman
###149 curious i'm furious and it is that my wife
###153 why do why i have to listen to your insane rules
###157 from new orleans is taxed well i think that no one should marketing handle
###162 religion was fall it's that's what's out there we would do
###166 for western democracies assault
###168 believe in that is just
###170 this barbarism when you see the actual effects of it
###173 you know oftentimes when we talk about extremism we talk about countries in the
###177 middle east but when you look at some of the laws that island house when it comes
###180 to contraception when it comes to you
###183 abortion you realize just how religious there really are
###187 for instance it wasn't until nineteen eighty five that ireland allowed uh...
###191 people over the age of eighteen to purchase condoms without a prescription
###197 contraband completely until about nineteen seventy nine on cell n and
###202 recently what relatively recently in two thousand five
###206 three women now filed a lawsuit against ireland because they have to travel out
###210 of the country to receive an abortion so understand because that sounds really
###214 confusing
###215 are they supposed to be a billboard generally not get the life is in danger
###218 as it was in this case and we started talking about
###221 well that's the problem according to the constitution abortion is
###224 flat out the legal
###226 but in nineteen eighty two supreme court ruled that
###228 it could be legalized the situation one woman's lives at risk
###232 if you continue the pregnancy the problem is nobody knows how to interpret
###235 that
###236 this for that's conflicting
###237 and so some hospital say well no we're not gonna do the work no matter what
###241 some hospitals do
###243 that's nowhere to run a country and that not only is that no way to run the
###246 country apples completely
###248 and against your pro-life stance because women are dying as a result of your
###254 refusing to terminate
###256 uh... a pregnancy you know i've done up
###259 fears that is not viable
###261 right fears that isn't even gonna survive
###264 you know it like in this case they know that she is going through a miscarriage
###268 so you're not saving anyone's life in this situation but in this case i think
###272 the doctors were so afraid of breaking the law that they decided to play it
###276 safe and just not do anything about it army go further i think uh...
###280 for the most religious people
###282 that take it for this kind of extreme ravine most
###284 the moral people
###287 in the world
###288 and so it's not like already religion and its morality or dividend or they're
###294 just the same as there is no doubt
###295 they're not the same as everybody's
###297 when you takes stupid laws that don't meet any sense
###301 that our team in your bible it doesn't even say you should have an abortion
###304 your bible
###305 anne apply to everybody what they are in your religion about your religion
###309 whether a group and they don't agree and some people dying because of it that's
###313 is the moral of act as you could possibly do and why
###317 because law an auto
###318 some and purpose in teen sixteen hundred years ago made a political document
###322 that he said jesus might have said o_j_'s of those friends might have said
###326 before that he has been swept this assaults
###329 don't they
###331 there in the pump daring leonard i like that and now we have these neanderthals
###336 in america that want to take us back to me is dark in the thousands nobel's
###340 across the country
###342 walk back
###344 reproductive rights
###346 i can't believe we're having this comes as it did so many states
###349 their weight
###352 i'm so sick of people's religion then
###355 and so sick of it
###357 and possibly know you have to do my review that do my religion
###361 block wall
