###55 DAVID CHOE: This is an awesome ride, and she doesn't want to
###57 be on camera.
###58 Actually very monumental--
###60 our first Asian ride that we've ever got in my entire
###62 life of hitchhiking.
###64 She's half Chinese and half Spanish.
###67 She said her father would be upset at her for picking up
###70 hitchhikers.
###71 But she picked us up because she saw our
###72 faces and we were Asian.
###75 And she said Asians don't hitchhike unless they really
###77 have to because they have too much pride.
###80 Little did she know, she picked up the two worst
###82 Koreans on the planet.
###83 So we got a ride from Lena, my favorite gay, Asian
###89 grandmother.
###91 She's been a wonderful ride.
###94 She gave us close to a 300 mile ride.
###97 We passed out of Texas.
###99 We're going to head into Oklahoma.
###102 I learned in this 300 miles how horrible my gaydar is.
###105 I had no idea.
###107 She came out of the closet in 1974.
###109 Her father still hasn't forgiven her.
###112 She got artificially inseminated by
###113 a Portuguese man.
###115 She doesn't like the gays these days because they're not
###117 really gay.
###118 All the people that say they're gay now are actually
###120 just bisexuals.
###121 And they need to just pick a side already.
###123 I mean, I should have known because of the haircut, but
###126 she kept talking about her song.
###127 I asked her about her husband or boyfriend.
###130 And then she just looked in the rear view like I was
###132 crazy, and she goes, I'm gay.
###135 And I was like, oh shit, all right, well excuse me.
###138 Sweet lady, was going to give us a ride all
###139 the way to New York.
###140 Instead we [INAUDIBLE] stop in Yukon, Oklahoma City, home of
###145 Garth Brooks and Toby Keith.
###147 
###150 So here we are with Mike.
###152 He's taking us towards Tulsa.
###158 DAVID CHOE: Yeah, fuck yeah.
###159 DAVID CHOE: Yeah.
###161 
###164 DAVID CHOE: Nah, man we're just on a great adventure.
###165 
###168 Mike's been fishing all day.
###169 Did you catch anything?
###171 Mike didn't catch anything, but--
###174 MIKE: I didn't do anything.
###176 DAVID CHOE: Mike's a little tipsy because he's been
###179 drinking all day.
###179 And he was nice enough to offer us some wheat beer.
###184 And you promise not to kill us.
###187 DAVID CHOE: OK, all right, I feel better now.
###191 DAVID CHOE: How many beers have you had today?
###192 
###195 DAVID CHOE: [LAUGH]
###199 Thumbs up.
###200 Everyone in the Bible Belt likes to DUI, likes
###203 to drink and drive.
###205 You ever picked up two Chinamen before?
###208 Two orientals?
###209 
###213 DAVID CHOE: You're a Vietnam vet?
###215 DAVID CHOE: Mike is a Vietnam vet.
###217 And that's why he has picked up two Chinamen before he's
###220 ever picked us up before.
###221 What do you think about the war now?
###225 DAVID CHOE: All right.
###226 You like George Bush?
###228 
###231 DAVID CHOE: Tell me about your love for George Bush.
###232 
###236 DAVID CHOE: Well, I mean, you almost looked like you had a
###238 tear coming down in your eye when you talk about him.
###240 DAVID CHOE: Tell me how much him.
###242 Tell me how much you love that man.
###243 MIKE: Love him.
###243 DAVID CHOE: Love him.
###244 MIKE: Love him.
###245 DAVID CHOE: And his daddy.
###247 DAVID CHOE: And his daddy.
###250 DAVID CHOE: And Ronald Reagan.
###253 DAVID CHOE: Fucking rule, man.
###254 
###261 DAVID CHOE: I don't get involved in politics.
###263 I'm a lover, not a fighter.
###265 MIKE: Oh, motherfucker you've got to
###266 get involved in politics.
###267 DAVID CHOE: I'm--
###268 MIKE: Kiss my ass, man.
###270 DAVID CHOE: Hey Mike, we rolled through Amarillo, we
###276 were warned by the whites and the Mexicans that the blacks
###278 are the worst people.
###281 DAVID CHOE: Yeah.
###282 That's true?
###284 MIKE: Well, yeah, I guess.
###285 DAVID CHOE: What's wrong with the blacks out in Oklahoma?
###287 
###290 DAVID CHOE: What do they do?
###294 DAVID CHOE: They'll kill your ass.
###296 You wouldn't have picked us up if we were black.
###298 
###309 DAVID CHOE: Wow.
###310 
###313 One of the best drunk-driving DUI hell rides
###315 I've had in a while.
###319 DAVID CHOE: No, we're going to hang out here, get some grub.
###322 At the--
###325 DAVID CHOE: What, you can't [INAUDIBLE]
###327 MIKE: That's bad, man.
###328 DAVID CHOE: Why, what's bad?
###329 MIKE: I scared you all.
###331 MIKE: [INAUDIBLE]
###333 fucking turds, man.
###334 
###336 DAVID CHOE: We're off into the sunset, wish us luck.
###338 Wish us luck.
###340 MIKE: Well, I can't do that.
###342 Hey.
###343 
###345 DAVID CHOE: You're a sweet guy too, buddy.
###346 To be completely honest, you did scare us a little bit.
###350 MIKE: I did?
###351 Why?
###352 DAVID CHOE: Well, it was probably, like, the sixth time
###354 the car almost flipped over.
###355 [LAUGH]
###357 MIKE: [INAUDIBLE]
###358 
###360 DAVID CHOE: Mike, you're a great guy, and I
###364 appreciate the ride.
###366 DAVID CHOE: We're not scared of you.
###368 DAVID CHOE: Mike, we're completely all good.
###370 Mike, come on.
###372 So long, Mike.
###373 DAVID CHOE: I love you too.
###374 
###380 DAVID CHOE: So Mike, one of the best hell rides I've had
###383 in my entire life, a scholar and a gentleman to be sure,
###387 basically gave us the grand tour of Oklahoma blasting his
###391 favorite band, Hinder.
###392 His stereo was on repeat, so we heard the same
###394 song about 17 times.
###396 He liked to scream at young, black teenagers when we were
###399 pulled up at red lights.
###401 And blast Hinder, fuck yeah, what do you
###403 think about my music?
###405 And in the last hour, drove around, pretty much in the
###407 same one-mile radius of where he picked us up.
###411 So actually we backtracked.
###413 So we're nowhere near Tulsa.
###418 And now I'm drunk, also.
###421 So we'll see where we end up tonight.
###423 
###432 Thanks guys, how far you guys going?
###433 
###438 So it's day seven, this is "Thumbs Up." It's exactly one
###445 week going on this trip.
###448 There's this thing that happens when you walk a lot
###450 carrying a lot of stuff and it's hot outside.
###452 Your butt cheeks, if you're a little bit overweight, they
###456 rub together.
###456 Your asshole starts to hurt a lot.
###458 I'm pretty tired, pretty hungry.
###461 But being so tired, I end up getting reinvigorated, full of
###464 life by the kindness of strangers, like the drunk
###468 people like Mike.
###469 I guess it takes a bit of alcohol to turn a lot humans
###472 into humans.
###475 I guess being drunk turns you from being this robot into a
###479 compassionate being that's like, hey, there's two fucking
###482 humans on the side of the road.
###484 It's hot outside.
###485 They look like they are going to die.
###487 I'm going to pick them up.
###489 [COUGH]
###493 
###513 G-BERRY: So what kind of haircut we giving your
###517 partner, man?
###518 
###523 DAVID CHOE: So what's going on with Oklahoma?
###527 G-BERRY: Man, Oklahoma is the place to be.
###529 We went to three states where the second we rolled into
###533 town, like,
###539 G-BERRY: Is that right?
###540 DAVID CHOE: Yeah.
###541 G-BERRY: I mean, is that how feel like blacks are here in
###544 Oklahoma, man?
###545 DAVID CHOE: That's what they said.
###546 G-BERRY: I'm a black man, and I'm proud to be black.
###548 You know what I'm saying?
###549 DAVID CHOE: I can see that.
###550 G-BERRY: So if a person tell you to watch out for the
###553 blacks, whoever that person was that told you to watch out
###555 for the blacks, you really need to watch
###556 out for that person.
###558 DAVID CHOE: Hey, I got another question for you guys.
###560 G-BERRY: Wassup, man?
###561 DAVID CHOE: How come black people don't pick up
###563 hitchhikers?
###564 
###567 DAVID CHOE: All right.
###568 Even if they look like two nice Chinamen.
###571 G-BERRY: Man.
###572 
###579 DAVID CHOE: I'm just saying.
###580 G-BERRY: Man, I'm not stopping.
###582 For nobody.
###583 I don't care if it's another black person.
###585 See you when you get there, brother.
###586 
###598 DAVID CHOE: It's all good.
###599 
###625 G-BERRY: [LAUGH]
###626 I'm just saying.
###628 
###636 DAVID CHOE: Because they put you in a little closet, and
###641 you never see anybody.
###642 G-BERRY: Oh, man.
###643 DAVID CHOE: Yeah, it's like solitary confinement.
###645 G-BERRY: How long?
###646 DAVID CHOE: It was three months, which is nothing
###649 compared to 14 years.
###651 But they were trying to put me in there for 7 years.
###653 And I don't know.
###657 DAVID CHOE: Like, Japanese food, rice.
###660 [LAUGH]
###664 DAVID CHOE: Yeah, it was tough, man.
###665 They didn't really like me too much.
###668 DAVID CHOE: Come on-- of course I do.
###671 DAVID CHOE: [LAUGH]
###673 G-BERRY: He has officialy been hood hawked.
###674 Hood hawk by G-Berry, man.
###675 HARRY KIM: The hood hawk.
###677 G-BERRY: Good to meet you.
###677 DAVID CHOE: Have a nice day.
###679 
###718 DAVID CHOE: Still in Tulsa, Oklahoma, having a tough time
###720 getting out.
###722 Amazingly, Danielle picked us up on the side of the road.
###727 And her house is under renovation.
###729 And so I asked her if I could paint it, and she said yes.
###733 DANIELLE: It's got to be nice, though, because I
###734 want to keep it.
###734 It can't be something that, when you guys leave, I
###736 roll-paint over it.
###737 DAVID CHOE: Of course, I will I'll make you beautiful.
###739 DANIELLE: Make it good.
###740 
###780 my boyfriend would lose his mind if he walked in here.
###783 DAVID CHOE: OK, let's just do it really quick.
###785 Just to see how.
###788 What the fuck is going on here?
###790 DANIELLE: [LAUGH]
###792 DAVID CHOE: What the fuck is these two chinks doing here
###793 playing instruments while you're dancing?
###794 Put your clothes back on.
###796 DANIELLE: Two chicks?
###796 DAVID CHOE: Chinks.
###797 [LAUGH]
###799 DANIELLE: I don't talk like that.
###801 HARRY KIM: Oh shit, dude.
###803 DANIELLE: This is my [INAUDIBLE]
###804 DAVID CHOE: Hi, how's it going.
###806 I'm Dave and Harry.
###809 We're doing a portrait of your fiancee on the wall here.
###812 DANIELLE: On the wall.
###813 
###822 DAVID CHOE: Thank you.
###823 DANIELLE: Bye.
###824 DAVID CHOE: Bye.
###824 DANIELLE: You guys take care of yourselves.
###825 HARRY KIM: Thank you for everything.
###826 DANIELLE: All right.
###827 DAVID CHOE: Awesome.
###828 Awesome, awesome, awesome.
###831 
###838 So as the sun sets in beautiful Tulsa, Oklahoma, we
###843 have experienced many great adventures in the barber shop,
###847 and also witht the Duchess of Darkness, who's actually not
###852 dark at all, and a sweet, beautiful
###853 butterfly on the inside.
###856 You know sometimes we get a raw deal and we need to change
###860 our situation in life.
###862 So this seems as great a spot as any right to hop a freight
###866 out of town.
###867 Still heading east.
###869 Many amazing cities to come--
###872 Memphis, Tennessee, New Orleans, Miami, and a big
###878 hurricane on the way.
###880 So till next time, "Thumbs Up."
###894 We rolled into Little Rock, Arkansas last night.
###900 And tried to hitchhike out.
###901 And the state troopers stopped us.
###905 It is just a little bit past midnight, I believe.
###909 And we are in Arkansas.
###912 And we got pulled over by these nice officers.
###917 They've amazingly not given us any tickets.
###921 They're going to tell us a little bit about Arkansas and
###924 hitchhikers and stuff like that.
###925 O. CRAIG: We don't see a whole lot of hitchhikers on the
###927 interstate course.
###928 It's illegal for anyone to be hitchhiking on a
###930 controlled-access highway.
###932 We don't have a whole lot of problem with that.
###934 DAVID CHOE: Have you guys ever picked up hitchhikers?
###935 O. CRAIG: Oh, yes.
###937 We usually make sure they're either aware that they're not
###940 supposed to be on the interstate, and get them off
###942 the highway.
###943 And of course, if they're non-compliant, then we wind up
###946 having to arrest them.
###947 Though we hate to do that.
###948 But sometimes you have to do that.
###950 DAVID CHOE: Right.
###951 So thank you so much for not punishing us for, you know--
###955 and anything else you guys want to say?
###958 Thumbs Up, America.
###959 HARRY KIM: Thumbs up.
###960 
###977 DAVID CHOE: We just jumped a freight in Little Rock that
###981 has ceramics in it.
###984 
###1020 Memphis on the rails.
###1023 
###1028 I don't who this guy is, but I see his shit everywhere.
###1031 I guess he's been hopping for 40 years.
###1034 I like his style.
###1035 It's nice and smooth.
###1036 Old school hobo.
###1038 Hobo, short for hoe boys--
###1041 dudes that used to swing the hoe,
###1045 riding the rails, vagabonds.
###1049 Never came back, jack.
###1052 
###1057 We're in a pretty dangerous situation right now.
###1059 We're in one the biggest yards I've ever been in, and we
###1062 can't find our way out.
###1063 And there's like 300 tracks here.
###1065 It's like a--
###1066 what's that video game? "Frogger"?
###1068 HARRY KIM: [LAUGH]
###1069 DAVID CHOE: It's like "Frogger." We're, like, going
###1070 in between the cars, and they're like [BOOM]
###1073 
###1076 All right, let's get out of here.
###1078 
###1082 Heavy fucking metal.
###1083 
###1088 We just made it through the "Frogger" maze.
###1090 And the only thing is, we're not really close to any
###1093 civilization.
###1095 So--
###1096 
###1100 sorry.
###1101 There's no train cops around, so I feel pretty--oh shit.
###1105 Let's get down.
###1107 
###1113 We're a little bit outside Memphis, I think.
###1116 We we're going to try to hitch it into town right now, but
###1120 we're pretty tired.
###1121 It was long, funky ride, and really screechy.
###1124 
###1135 We got picked up two the weirdest
###1139 Grateful Dead fans ever.
###1141 MALE SPEAKER 1: GDF, baby.
###1144 DAVID CHOE: Love Jerry Garcia, but are into rap, graffiti,
###1148 ex-vegetarians, and they'll punch you in the face.
###1149 
###1214 DAVID CHOE: We are in Memphis, Tennessee.
###1217 And a lot of things just happened all at once.
###1220 First of all, we're in barbecue
###1221 territory in bush country.
###1223 We were just walking down Midtown Memphis and we ran
###1227 into this amazing restaurant, Casa Blanca Cafe.
###1231 And then we aw the Jaguar and were checking it out, and
###1236 Aimer, the owner and the amazing human being that owns
###1239 the shop came out and told us about the time he--
###1245 this thing goes 180.
###1246 He got ticketed for 155.
###1248 Cops never caught him.
###1250 Amazing human being all in all, so we started talking.
###1252 He's from Palestine, he's from Jerusalem.
###1254 While we we're talking, he mentioned
###1256 his ex-wife was Jewish.
###1257 And that's like the same thing as me marrying a
###1260 Japanese girl or--
###1262 AIMER: The story of me and my ex-wife Karen.
###1265 Is amazing.
###1267 We got married when we [INAUDIBLE] we start to go out
###1271 almost every night.
###1273 Before I mean, she [INAUDIBLE] ask all kind of question.
###1277 And after that, we got in love.
###1279 And her people before, 95% from the people,
###1283 we know each other.
###1285 And when they find that I am Arab, they start to hate me
###1287 and they start to take her away from me.
###1290 Telling all some bad things about me.
###1292 He's going to kill you--
###1293 DAVID CHOE: Your relationship just could
###1295 start an entire war.
###1297 I mean, that's like, the most taboo sex, like Jew on Arab
###1301 porn, it's insane.
###1304 AIMER: I mean, even her brother, and her mother, and
###1307 her all her brothers, nobody came to the wedding.
###1309 DAVID CHOE: No one came to the wedding?
###1311 AIMER: No one.
###1312 No one.
###1312 And nobody's spoke to her for three years.
###1314 DAVID CHOE: Was the sex good, at least?
###1316 AIMER: It was awesome.
###1318 [LAUGHTER]
###1319 DAVID CHOE: And then actually, a second question, which is
###1321 even more important than that question.
###1323 And that question is, can we get a ride?
###1325 in the Jaguar.
###1327 AIMER: Let's go.
###1328 DAVID CHOE: No, you give us a ride.
###1329 You give us a ride.
###1330 
###1334 Our best ride so far.
###1335 Thumbs Up, America.
###1336 
###1345 We are still in Memphis, Tennessee.
###1349 Unbelievable luck yesterday, we ran into Aimer, a
###1353 Palestinian man who let us stay at his mansion.
###1355 And cooked us the most amazing lunch, and then dinner, and
###1359 then breakfast this morning.
###1360 Dropped us off in his Jaguar at the wonderful
###1363 Wonder Bread Factory.
###1365 Wonder Bread, delicious, amazing, wonder, white bread.
###1370 And it's a good thing because we are heading into the
###1375 Mississippi.
###1376 So far we've cut through states that have a lot of
###1380 hatred towards a black people from the whites.
###1383 And now we're going to sort of flip-flop and head into the
###1386 states where there's a lot of hatred toward white people
###1388 from the blacks.
###1389 So what better way to start the day with some white bread.
###1391 Also Wonder Bread is the most amazing
###1395 ingredient for budget eating.
###1398 So we're going try to score some free Wonder Bread or buy
###1401 some at the bread discount store thrift store.
###1404 And I will show you some tricks of the trade and some
###1406 of Dave Choe's favorite Wonder Bread recipes.
###1409 
###1426 This is my makeshift cooking show.
###1428 
###1433 I'm going to show you how to eat really healthy and
###1435 nutritious on the road.
###1436 We've got Wonder Bread, sardines, we have Tang.
###1441 And we have peanut butter.
###1442 When you eat this, and chew this up in your mouth, that's
###1452 what it looks like.
###1454 Do you know what that is?
###1455 That's glue in your stomach.
###1457 And say this is your stomach, and you have glue going down.
###1461 It squeezes your stomach into a pasty knot, and you're not
###1465 hungry forever.
###1466 It's a great diet plan.
###1467 You don't get hungry.
###1469 And it's really hard to force down after a while.
###1471 I mean, I can't even talk right now.
###1472 I've got peanut butter and Wonder Bread
###1473 all mixed right there.
###1475 So this is more of a survival thing.
###1478 Now, they've got sardines and all kinds of sauces.
###1480 But the best one to bring on the road is any kind of
###1482 sardine with any kind of oil.
###1484 This one has soybean oil with hot green chilis.
###1488 Olive oil's good, but we're not doing gourmet today.
###1490 So here, we've got a delicious fish's head sandwich for you.
###1492 HARRY KIM: Mmm.
###1493 DAVID CHOE: Mmm.
###1494 HARRY KIM: Send it over.
###1495 DAVID CHOE: With green chilis.
###1499 All right.
###1499 Who doesn't like Tang.
###1501 Tang is the astronaut drink made for astronauts, used in
###1507 space, delicious on a summer day with water.
###1512 You never think Tang and Wonder Bread.
###1513 But boy, you're in for a special treat right now.
###1517 When I've got for you today--
###1519 Tang balls.
###1521 And what are Tang balls?
###1522 Exactly what it sounds like.
###1523 A delicious, tangy, sweet, delicious, after-dinner
###1528 dessert treat.
###1529 Gets the fish oil taste out of your mouth.
###1531 Gets the peanut butter taste out of your mouth.
###1534 Delicious.
###1535 Never tasted anything like it.
###1537 Bon appetit, America.
###1540 Bon appetit,
###1552 Here we are at the Mississippi River.
###1554 We've traveled the state so far by car,
###1557 automobiles, and trains.
###1560 And we're really liking the look of this river.
###1564 This dirty, amazing, fucking river.
###1566 
###1585 Hello, Old Miss.
###1587 M-I-S-S-I-S-S-I-P-P-I. I'm pretty sure we just crossed
###1592 over somewhere over the state line.
###1593 We couldn't get a ride so we just walked and hiked, it's
###1596 hot outside, from Memphis into the state line for
###1601 Mississippi.
###1603 And we are on one of the back roads.
###1605 You can heard the harmonica music in
###1607 the background somewhere.
###1608 We'll try to catch a boat on the river, we'll see.
###1613 Looks like the jungle.
###1615
