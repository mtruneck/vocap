###123 HANNAH BROOKS: A waria is an Indonesian transsexual,
###126 derived from the words wanita, meaning woman, and pria, man.
###130 Waria are known as Indonesia's third sex.
###134 This centuries-old tradition is largely accepted as part of
###137 Indonesian culture.
###138 However, it's one that doesn't sit easily with Islam, which
###142 has risen to become the country's dominant religion
###144 since it's arrival in the 13th century.
###147 Since Islamic law acknowledges only two sexes, male and
###151 female, and forbids men to dress and adopt the mannerisms
###154 of women, waria have been pushed further and further
###157 into the margins of society.
###160 This makes it difficult to practice their faith.
###163 While it seems strange that the waria are passionate about
###165 a religion that shuns them, they believe that even if the
###168 majority of Islamic authorities don't
###170 accept them, God does.
###173 I headed out to meet Maryani, a 50-year-old transsexual who
###176 runs the Senin-Kamis School from the back
###179 of her beauty salon.
###180 And is mother to her adopted daughter Rizky, who she raises
###183 on her own.
###185 Maryani greeted my translator, Mendez, and
###187 myself at the door.
###188 And asked us to come in quietly, as we had arrived in
###191 the middle of a Quran class.

###204 MARYANI: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###205 
###233 HANNAH BROOKS: As I talked with her more, Maryani told me
###235 about her life.
###237 Despite living through some tough times, she also had a
###239 lot of fun when she was younger.
###241 She used to be the singer in a dangdut band, which is
###243 Indonesia's sexy style of pop music.
###246 And from her description, it sounded like her
###248 career was a big deal.
###250 That all changed when she converted to Islam in her 30s.
###253 She left behind her hedonistic lifestyle to focus on her
###256 spirituality.
###257 Because, as she puts it, her conversion
###259 came from the heart.

###298 HANNAH BROOKS: Following the 2006 earthquake that rocked
###301 Yogyakarta, Maryani gathered lots of her friends to
###304 participate in some of the mass prayers.
###307 An older priest friend was so impressed by her efforts and
###309 ability to draw a large group that he invited her to start a
###312 place for the transvestites to gather.
###314 And thus, the school was born.
###316 MARYANI: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###319 
###329 HANNAH BROOKS: I was enjoying hanging out with Maryani and
###332 wanted to spend some more time talking to her one on one.
###335 But unexpectedly, she asked me if I'd like to attend the
###337 funeral of a waria who recently died from HIV
###340 complications.
###342 She told me that it would help me understand some of the
###344 difficulties they face.
###346 I agreed, and we hopped in the car.
###348 Maryani's friend Yuni Shara, who was a member of the
###350 school, caught a ride with us to the funeral.
###355 She pulled out her phone and started showing me photos of
###357 her main squeeze.
###359 YUNI SHARA: My husband.
###361 HANNAH BROOKS: Your husband.
###361 YUNI SHARA: [LAUGHING], [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###365 
###372 HANNAH BROOKS: He's married to a woman.
###374 
###379 HANNAH BROOKS: Oh, really?
###379 MARYANI: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###381 
###407 HANNAH BROOKS: Do you do your own makeup?
###408 YUNI SHARA: Oh yeah.
###409 HANNAH BROOKS: You do eyeliner better than I do.
###412 Much, much better.
###414 
###430 Thank you.
###432 The funeral was held in the street of a
###434 waria-friendly community.
###435 
###438 Most of the local townspeople were sitting around and
###441 milling about, waiting for the ceremony to get underway.
###444 
###447 Wow.
###449 There was also a huge amount of warias sitting around,
###452 smoking cigarettes and chatting.
###454 I'd seen photos of the warias, and knew they
###456 had distinctive faces.
###458 But seeing them in the flesh and dressed rather
###460 provocatively was overwhelming.
###462 MARYANI: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###464 
###493 
###496 HANNAH BROOKS: Maryani made a speech about the importance of
###499 warias acting with dignity and self-respect in order to be
###503 seen as equal members of society.
###505 She encouraged them to contribute to the funeral
###507 costs of warias that pass away.
###510 However, most of the warias didn't seem to be paying much
###513 attention to what she was saying.
###515 They gave off the impression that a funeral is just
###517 business as usual.
###518 And in fact, it wasn't that far off.
###521 Usually four warias die each month, mostly from the things
###524 that Maryani was trying to warn against in her speech.

###556 YUNI SHARA: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###558 
###584 HANNAH BROOKS: Could you, while we're here, take us to
###588 see some of the street performers?
###589 YUNI SHARA: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###591 
###598 HANNAH BROOKS: We headed back to our hotel to rest up for
###601 the night, and prepared to set out in the morning to meet up
###604 with some of Maryani's street singer friends.
###606 
###613 MARYANI: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###616 
###643 HANNAH BROOKS: I went to meet two friends of Maryani's,
###646 Jamila and Wulan, who work as street singers in central
###649 Yogyakarta.
###651 When I got there, I realized I had met them the day before at
###653 the school.
###654 But then they had been dressed as men.
###656 [SINGING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###665 WULAN: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###668 
###673 HANNAH BROOKS: So you used to work as a prostitute, and now
###676 you work as a street performer.

###684 JAMILA: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

###701 [SINGING]
###705 JAMILA: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###707 
###720 HANNAH BROOKS: Some people got angry when the warias
###722 approached and shooed them away, while others happily
###725 gave them money.
###727 Virtually everyone stared.
###729 One small boy burst into tears and started screaming.
###732 That was really intense.
###734 We were just up there, and the girls were singing.
###737 And this little kid totally fucking flipped out and
###740 started screaming when he saw them.
###742 And the mother like, grabbed the kid and was really angry.
###746 Their reaction was really, really-- like, the mother was
###749 furious that the kid was so upset.
###751 And the kid looked like he had seen the devil or something.
###754 MENDEZ: Yeah, yeah.
###756 HANNAH BROOKS: After spending time with the warias, I began
###759 to forget that their appearance could
###761 be alarming as first.
###763 As I watched people's reactions and the mockery they
###765 endured, I felt a huge amount of empathy for them.
###770 WULAN: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###773 
###791 HANNAH BROOKS: While street performing seems like a dream
###794 job compared to prostitution, the downside is that the hours
###797 are long, and enduring the noise and grit of
###799 Yogyakarta is tough.
###800 The negatives of working as a prostitute are obvious, and a
###803 lot more dangerous.
###805 MARYANI: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###806 
###841 HANNAH BROOKS: That night I planned to meet up with Novi
###843 and Nur, who work as prostitutes.
###846 Nur, who's only 19, read about Maryani and the school on the
###850 Internet, and traveled all the way from Lombok, which is a
###852 small island near Bali, to meet her.
###856 NUR: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###875 HANNAH BROOKS: Do you miss your family?
###878 Or are you happy to be away from them?
###880 NUR: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###881 
###900 HANNAH BROOKS: What would you like to do with your life?
###903 NUR: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###905 
###920 HANNAH BROOKS: That's great.
###922 I hope you can.
###923 
###926 We gave the girls a ride to their regular hooking spot,
###928 which was in a sketchy area next to a railway station.
###931 I'd heard stories of waria being hit by trains while
###934 working in this location.
###937 Is it safe working here?
###939 NOVI: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###941 
###965 HANNAH BROOKS: So that's where most of the customers hang
###968 out, down there?
###969 NOVI: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###971 
###980 HANNAH BROOKS: The girls stood for a while by the train
###981 tracks but didn't get any customers.
###983 They decided to head over to a busier street they also
###986 regularly work.
###987 We hung out across the road, away from potential customers,
###990 so that the girls could do their thing.
###992 A few guys approached here and there, but for the most part,
###995 nothing really happened.
###997 The girls drank booze with a shopkeeper, practiced their
###999 poses, and played with their phones.
###1001 After a few hours, it didn't look like they were going to
###1003 have much luck tonight.
###1007 It's about midnight now.
###1009 We've just been standing across the other side of the
###1011 road to let the girls kind of do their thing and try and get
###1014 some customers.
###1015 I don't know.
###1016 I just don't know how they do it.
###1018 Like Nur was saying, she just wants to go out tonight and
###1021 work so that she can have some money to get through tomorrow.
###1025 They definitely have dreams and things they want to do in
###1027 the future and stuff.
###1029 But they can only think this far.
###1031 They can't really plan.
###1033 It's very much in the day for them.
###1036 Anyway, it's time to go home.
###1037 I'm going to go across the road now and say goodbye to
###1039 the girls, and wish them good luck for tonight.
###1041 I hope they make some cash.
###1043 And I hope they stay safe.
###1045 As we were wrapping up, we noticed one particular guy
###1048 pestering Nur and creeping her out quite a bit.
###1051 He looked like the kind of guy who couldn't afford the girls'
###1054 low prices.
###1055 As he kept hassling Nur, Novi ran over to us and asked if
###1058 we'd take Nur home.
###1061 
###1065 HANNAH BROOKS: Nur wants to go home?
###1069 Yeah, sure.
###1070 Yep.
###1071 MARYANI: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1073 
###1097 HANNAH BROOKS: The next morning we woke up and headed
###1099 to a small village somewhere outside Yogyakarta.
###1103 Jamila was getting a black market breast job and agreed
###1105 to let us come, as long as we didn't film where we were or
###1108 who was doing the procedure.
###1111 I knew that it was common for warias who believe it makes
###1113 them look more feminine to inject silicone into their
###1116 faces and breasts.
###1117 Jamila was really excited.
###1119 Because although she's had injections in her cheeks and
###1121 chin, she would be getting boobs for the first time.
###1124 
###1129 MARYANI: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1131 
###1162 HANNAH BROOKS: The room was incredibly hot,
###1164 and definitely unsterile.
###1166 And the sight of Jamila's chest growing into two oddly
###1169 shaped mounds was enough to make both Mendez and I start
###1172 to feel ill.
###1174 JAMILA: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1183 MENDEZ: Was it painful?
###1185 Could you feel it?
###1186 JAMILA: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1188 
###1201 HANNAH BROOKS: We needed a little air after witnessing
###1204 the operation.
###1205 So we decided to head back to Maryani's and check in with
###1208 the rest of the warias.
###1209 When we arrived, Maryani was getting ready to head out on a
###1212 scooter with Rizky and told me to hop on.
###1215 
###1233 We were heading to the market to buy makeup and accessories
###1235 for the big party we were throwing
###1237 the warias that night.
###1239 Maryani seemed genuinely excited to get the chance to
###1241 go out with me for a bit.
###1243 
###1249 She said that tonight was all about celebrating being a
###1251 waria, and about being comfortable with yourself.
###1255 MARYANI: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1256 
###1304 HANNAH BROOKS: The warias were busy getting dolled up for the
###1307 party while Maryani instructed her assistant to make me look
###1310 like the sexiest waria possible.
###1312 
###1316 So it appears that she is now attaching
###1319 the other large growth--
###1322 some kind of tail, head tail.
###1324 It feels like I've got a giant clump of weed on my head.
###1331 You like?
###1332 
###1334 Yeah.
###1335 FEMALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1338 
###1358 HANNAH BROOKS: While the girls sat in the schoolroom taking
###1361 glamour shots on their cell phones and gossiping about
###1364 cute boys, I noticed that Maryani was sitting quietly in
###1367 the salon as she applied her makeup.
###1369 
###1372 MARYANI: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1373 
###1406 [SINGING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1407 
###1423 HANNAH BROOKS: Going to have to practice that more.
###1425 FEMALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1428 
###1448 HANNAH BROOKS: What do you think about God?
###1451 Like, to you, what is God?
###1454 I'm interested because I don't know how I feel about it.
###1457 And I'm always interested to hear other people's opinions.
###1462 MARYANI: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1463 
###1494 HANNAH BROOKS: Holy fucking shit.
###1497 
###1499 The party was at a restaurant with a stage, sound system,
###1502 and a resident keyboard player, who wanted to know who
###1505 the new lady-boy was when I walked in.
###1508 Obviously, Maryani had done a good job on my makeup.
###1512 The waria were trying to be on their best behavior.
###1515 But some of the younger girls were sneaking swigs of booze
###1517 under the table.
###1518 It might have helped them with their performance anxiety.
###1522 The warias took turns singing and dancing, which involved a
###1525 lot of dangdut and a lot of Celine Dion.
###1528 I was super impressed by Maryani's numbers.
###1532 The warias sang and danced well into the night.
###1535 I was dragged to the dance floor over and over, and did
###1537 my best to shake it like a Javanese bride.
###1540 Eventually, I was yanked onstage to perform the love
###1542 song the warias had been teaching me.
###1545 MARYANI: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1547 
###1591 HANNAH BROOKS: Even though their situation is far from
###1594 perfect, I was impressed by the warias' determination to
###1597 better themselves, and particularly by Maryani's
###1600 refusal to play by the rules.
###1602 It takes a courageous waria to do what she has--
###1605 raise a child on her own, reach the pinnacle of wariadom
###1608 by opening her own beauty salon, and to start the school
###1612 so that others might do the same.
###1614 As for the fact that the waria are dedicated to the very
###1617 religion that refuses to accept them, I agree with what
###1620 Maryani told me.
###1622 Since God is the one that judges whether they go to
###1624 heaven or hell, it's their relationship with Him that
###1627 matters, not the opinions of people.
###1630 With lipstick in their pockets and God on their side, it
###1633 seems the warias have a fighting chance.
###1635
