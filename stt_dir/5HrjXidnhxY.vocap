###2 OKAY EVERYONE I WANT TO MAKE AN ANNOUNCEMENT
###3 ABOUT THE MIDTERM. THERE WILL BE A REVIEW SESSION FOR
###7 THE MIDTERM AND I POSTED IT TO YOUR LEFT. ON THE TOP
###11 HERE THE REVIEW SESSION WILL BE HELD IN DWINELLE AND
###14 IT IS A PART OF GETTING ROOM IN TIME AS YOU GUYS CAN
###17 PROBABLY GUESS, THE CAMPUS IS VERY CROWDED. SO, IT IS
###20 OPEN TO ALL. IT IS A WORKING SESSION. I DON'T HAVE
###23 ANYTHING PREPARED. COME WITH YOUR QUESTIONS. I WILL
###26 ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS EVEN IF THEY ARE QUESTIONS THAT
###28 ARE ON THE EXAM. OF COURSE I WON'T TELL YOU, BUT I
###30 WILL STILL ANSWER THEM. NOW ABOUT THE QUESTIONS,
###33 THERE ARE SAMPLE QUESTIONS FOR THE EXAM TAKEN FROM
###37 PREVIOUS EXAMS POSTED ON THE WEB SITE. AGAIN, THOSE
###41 ARE MOSTLY MEANT TO GIVE YOU AN INDICATION OF
###43 A FORMAT. THERE WILL BE MULTIPLE AND WE WILL TALK
###46 A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT IT AS WE APPROACH THE END OF
###49 THIS PORTION OF THE CLASS.
###51 I ALSO WANT TO SAY TO YOU THAT GIVEN SAMPLE
###55 HOURS,
###56 WHEN WE HAVE TALKED, I HAVE BROUGHT UP SAMPLE
###58 QUESTIONS AND WE HAVE DISCUSSED THEM. SO, THERE ARE
###61 PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOU TO GET AN IDEA OF WHAT
###64 THE EXAM IS LIKE BEFORE YOU TAKE IT.
###68 THE LAST POINT I WANT TO MENTION TO YOU IS THAT
###70 IF YOU ARE ILL ON THE DAY OF THE EXAM OR YOU GET SICK,
###74 THE ONLY WAY WE CAN EXCUSE YOU FROM THE EXAM IS IF YOU
###77 HAVE A NOTE FROM THE TANG CENTER. WE CANNOT MAKE
###80 A JUDGMENT ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT YOUR ILLNESS IS SEVERE
###84 OR NOT. BUT, WE ALWAYS TAKE THE NOTE FROM
###86 THE TANG CENTER. SO, IF YOU ARE GOING TO BE ILL OR IF
###89 YOU ARE ILL, MAKE SURE YOU GO TO THE TANG CENTER AND
###91 BRING YOUR GSI THE NOTE, OTHERWISE YOU WILL NOT BE
###95 EXCUSED FROM THE EXAM AND YOU WILL HAVE MISSED IT.
###97 ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS?
###100 OKAY. LAST TIME WE ENDED BY TALKING ABOUT THE
###103 VASCULAR CAMBIUM. AND, WE HAD THIS LAYER OF CELLS,
###107 
###110 THE INSIDE OF THE VASCULAR CAMBIUM WE MADE SECONDARY
###113 XYLEM. AND TO THE OUTSIDE WE MADE SECONDARY PHLOEM.
###121 THESE TWO CELL TYPES OF VERY DIFFERENT. THE SECONDARY
###125 XYLEM CELL TYPES ARE DEAD WHEN THEY ARE FUNCTIONAL.
###128 THEY HAVE A LOT OF LIGAND IN THEIR WALLS. WHEREAS,
###132 THE SECONDARY PHLOEM ARE CELLS THAT ARE LIVING WHEN
###135 THEY ARE FUNCTIONAL. THEY HAVE LOST THEIR NUCLEUS BUT
###137 THEY STILL HAVE SOME CYTOPLASMS. YET, AS DIFFERENT AS
###141 THESE TWO CELL TYPES ARE FROM EACH OTHER, THEY BOTH
###144 ORIGINATED FROM A COMMON CELL, VASCULAR CAMBIUM. AND
###149 TODAY, WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS TO BEGIN THE FIRST OF TWO
###152 LECTURES IN WHICH WE TALK ABOUT THE COMMITMENT TO
###160 DIFFERENTIATE. WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE CONTROLS AT
###168 LEAST AS WE UNDERSTAND THEM WHICH CAUSE A CELL TO
###171 FOLLOW A PARTICULAR DEVELOPMENTAL PATHWAY TO BECOME
###175 EITHER, IN THIS CASE, A SECONDARY XYLEM CELL OR
###178 A SECONDARY PHLOEM CELL. AND, THIS IS A TOPIC WHICH
###181 
###186 CONTRADICT EACH OTHER, BUT IN THE END I HOPE YOU GET
###189 AN APPRECIATION AND A PICTURE OF WHAT THESE CONTROLS
###191 ARE LIKE OR AT LEAST WHAT WE THINK THESE CONTROLS ARE
###194 LIKE.
###194 NOW, THE STUDIES OF THIS COMMITMENT TO
###197 DIFFERENTIATE BEGAN PROBABLY IN THE 19TH CENTURY WITH
###201 A GERMAN BOTANIST BY THE NAME OF SACHS. SACHS
###206 BELIEVED THAT THERE WERE SUBSTANCES WHICH HE CALLED
###210 ORGAN OR TISSUE FORMING SUBSTANCES.
###221 SO, HE ENVISIONED A ROOT FORMING SUBSTANCE,
###231 A SHOOT FORMING SUBSTANCE, ETC. SO, HE THOUGHT THAT
###239 THERE WERE THESE COMPOUNDS WHICH IF THEY WERE PUT ON
###242 THE PLANT OR FOUND IN A PARTICULAR REGION OF THE
###245 PLANT, THEY WOULD CAUSE A ROOT TO FORM OR CAUSE
###247 A SHOOT TO FORM. AND THIS WAS A WIDELY ACCEPTED VIEW
###252 IN THE 19TH CENTURY, AT LEAST IN THE MIDDLE TO THE
###254 EARLY 19TH CENTURY, WITHOUT REALLY ANY PROOF. AT
###258 
###261 IDEAS AND HIS HYPOTHESIS, ANOTHER WORKER WITH WHOM ALL
###266 OF YOU, I BELIEVE, ARE FAMILIAR, CHARLES DARWIN WAS
###271 ALSO INTERESTED IN STUDYING GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT.
###281 AND THE WORK I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT NOW WAS DONE
###284 WITH DARWIN AND WITH HIS SON FRANCIS. DARWIN, CHARLES
###293 DARWIN AND HIS SON FRANCIS DARWIN WERE INTERESTED IN
###295 PLANT MOVEMENTS
###302 OR AS THEY ARE KNOWN AS TROPISMS.
###308 TROPISMS. AND THE PARTICULAR TYPE OF TROPISM OR
###312 MOVEMENT THAT THEY WERE INTERESTED IN, IS ONE THAT YOU
###314 HAVE ALREADY BEEN EXPOSED TO. THEY WERE INTERESTED IN
###318 THE BENDING
###324 OF PLANTS TOWARDS LIGHT. OR AS THIS IS
###329 KNOWN AS PHOTOTROPISM. AS YOU HAVE ALREADY SEEN
###337 A RESPONSE OF AN ORGANISM TO LIGHT WHEN WE TALKED
###340 ABOUT THE FUNGUS PILOBILUS IN THE VERY FIRST LECTURE.
###343 IT ALREADY SHOWED PHOTOTROPISM AND IT ALSO MOVED OR
###346 BENT TOWARD THE LIGHT. NOW FOR THESE EXPERIMENTS
###349 DARWIN AND FRANCIS DID NOT WORK WITH PILOBILUS WITH
###352 
###357 WORKED WITH A PARTICULAR PORTION OF THE GRASS SEEDLING
###362 THAT ALL OF YOU HAVE OR WILL BE SEEING THIS WEEK IN
###365 THE LAB.
###365 THEY WORKED WITH THE GRASS COLEOPTILE OR THE
###370 SHEATH COVERING THE SHOOT JUST BEFORE THE SHOOT
###376 EMERGES FROM THE SOIL. AND TO REMIND YOU OF THE
###381 COLEOPTILE, IF WE HAVE A SEED. HERE IS THE SEED. THE
###388 COLEOPTILE IS THE SHEATH PROTECTING THE SHOOT, WHICH
###392 WOULD BE HERE.
###399 HERE IS THE COLEOPTILE. AND WHAT WERE
###401 INTERESTED IN IS THEY TOOK SEEDLINGS, LIKE THIS ONE.
###406 AND WE WILL DRAW IT AGAIN. TOOK SEEDLINGS OF GRASSES
###409 AND THEY GAVE IT LIGHT FROM ONE DIRECTION, SO CALLED,
###413 UNILATERAL ILLUMINATION.
###423 SO LET'S SAY THEY GAVE IT
###424 LIGHT FROM THIS DIRECTION. UNILATERAL ILLUMINATION.
###428 AND WHAT THEY FOUND, IF THEY WAITED FOR SOME TIME, IS
###432 AS YOU ALL KNOW, THE COLEOPTILE APPEAR TO MOVE TOWARD
###440 THE LIGHT OR BEND TOWARD THE LIGHT.
###448 TOWARD
###449 THE LIGHT. POSITIVE PHOTOTROPISM. NOW, AN IMPORTANT
###453 POINT WHICH WE NEED TO MAKE ON THIS BENDING AND WHICH
###456 IS GOING TO UNDERLIES WHAT WE TALK ABOUT LATER IN
###458 LECTURE IS THE FOLLOWING.
###461 FOR THIS I WANT YOU ALL TO LOOK AT THIS AND I
###462 WILL WRITE IT DOWN FOR YOU. FOR THIS BENDING TO OCCUR
###466 THIS SIDE OVER HERE HAS TO GROW MORE THAN THIS SIDE
###472 OVER HERE. FOR BENDING TO OCCUR ONE SIDE HAS TO GROW
###476 MORE THAN THE OTHER.
###498 AND THIS IS KNOWN AS DIFFERENTIAL GROWTH. THE
###509 TWO SIDES ARE RESPONDING IN A DIFFERENT MANNER, THEY
###511 ARE GROWING IN A DIFFERENT MANNER.
###525 NOW, DARWIN AND
###526 FRANCIS DID A LOT OF EXPERIMENTS AND I WANT TO JUST
###528 TELL YOU ABOUT A FEW OF THE EXPERIMENTS THEY DID TO
###532 TRY TO UNDERSTAND THE BASIS OF THIS DIFFERENTIAL
###535 GROWTH. THE BASIS OF THIS PHOTOTROPISM. THE FIRST
###540 EXPERIMENT THEY DID WAS TO ASK, WHAT PART OF THE
###548 
###555 QUOTES. AND, WHAT THEY DID WAS TO TAKE COLEOPTILES IN
###563 SEEDLINGS AND COVER VARIOUS PORTIONS OF THEM WITH
###568 BLACK CLOTH OR WHAT WAS THE EQUIVALENT TO ALUMINUM
###570 FOIL IN THE 19TH CENTURY AND FIND OUT WHICH PORTION
###576 WAS NECESSARY TO BE EXPOSED TO THE LIGHT IN ORDER TO
###579 GET PHOTOTROPISM. AND FROM THIS WORK THEY CONCLUDED
###586 THAT THE TIP RECEIVED THE LIGHT.
###595 AND, THEY
###596 HYPOTHESIZED
###602 THAT SOMETHING MOVED FROM THE TIP DOWN TO
###605 CAUSE THE DIFFERENTIAL GROWTH.
###626 THESE WERE VERY
###627 IMPORTANT OBSERVATIONS AND THESE HYPOTHESIS, THESE
###631 OBSERVATIONS AND MANY MORE ON PLANT MOVEMENTS WERE
###638 PUBLISHED IN A BOOK. FRANCIS AND CHARLES DARWIN
###641 PUBLISHED IT IN A BOOK CALLED, "THE POWER OF MOVEMENT"
###654 IN 1896. AND WE HAVE A NUMBER OF COPIES IN OUR
###659 LIBRARY. IT IS A VERY FASCINATING BOOK. THEY MAKE A
###662 LOT OF OBSERVATIONS. MANY OF WHICH, IN FACT, MOST OF
###664 WHICH HAVE NEVER BEEN FOLLOWED UP ON. SO, THESE
###668 
###671 BASICALLY THAT WAS THE END OF THE WORK ON THEM UNTIL
###674 ABOUT THE 1930'S. AND IN THE 1930'S DARWIN'S
###680 OBSERVATIONS ON THE COLEOPTILE AND PHOTOTROPISM WERE
###684 PICKED UP AGAIN IN AN ATTEMPT TO TRY AND UNDERSTAND
###687 WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THIS PARTICULAR MECHANISM. AND,
###691 THE VERY FIRST EXPERIMENTS WHICH PEOPLE DID IN THESE
###695 SITUATIONS WERE THE FOLLOWING:
###701 THEY TOOK A COLEOPTILE, AND WE SHOULD SAY THAT
###705 THIS WORK WAS DONE IN DARKNESS. IT REALLY WASN'T
###711 TOTAL DARKNESS, IT WAS IN A ROOM THAT HAD GREEN LIGHT,
###716 GREEN LIGHT AS FAR AS THE PLANT IS CONCERNED IS LIKE
###718 DARKNESS. PLANTS DON'T REALLY RESPOND IN THIS WAY TO
###722 THE GREEN LIGHT. BUT, FOR OUR PURPOSES WE WILL SAY IT
###724 WAS DONE IN DARKNESS. NOW WHAT THESE PEOPLE DID, WAS
###727 FIRST OF ALL TO CONFIRM DARWIN'S HYPOTHESIS THAT
###731 SOMETHING WAS GOING ON IN THE TIP. THEY TOOK THE
###734 COLEOPTILE AND THEY PUT A PIECE OF A FOIL, ALUMINUM
###738 
###744 AND THEN THEY GAVE IT UNILATERAL LIGHT.
###752 AND THEY GOT
###752 NO BENDING. AND THAT IS EXACTLY PARALLEL TO WHAT
###759 DARWIN SHOULD BE, WHAT DARWIN PREDICTED. DARWIN ALSO
###764 PREDICTED THAT THERE WAS BEING MADE IN THE TIP AND
###768 THIS EXPERIMENT TENDED TO CONFIRM THAT WHEN YOU PUT
###770 THE ALUMINUM FOIL BETWEEN THE TIP AND THE REST OF THE
###775 COLEOPTILE, YOU PREVENTED WHATEVER WAS BEING MADE FROM
###779 MOVING DOWN. SO, ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT SOMETHING WAS
###782 BEING MADE, WHAT THESE INVESTIGATORS NEXT DID WAS TO
###786 TAKE AGAR, SHEET THE AGAR, MOST OF YOU HAVE SEEN AGAR
###791 BEFORE. AND ON THIS AGAR SHEET, TO PLACE LOTS OF
###795 COLEOPTILE TIPS. SO THESE ARE COLEOPTILE ON AGAR.
###806 AND THEY LET THE COLEOPTILE TIPS SIT ON THE AGAR ON
###810 THE ASSUMPTION THAT WHATEVER WAS BEING MADE BY THE
###814 COLEOPTILE TIPS WOULD DIFFUSE INTO THE AGAR.
###821 AND THEN THEY DID A SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS.
###824 AGAIN, THESE ARE IN DARKNESS. IN DARKNESS. THE FIRST
###833 
###837 THEY DIVIDED IT IN TO PIECES. DIVIDED IT IN TO PIECES
###847 AND THEN SUBSTITUTED FOR THE COLEOPTILE TIP. LET'S
###857 TALK ABOUT HOW THESE SUBSTITUTION EXPERIMENTS LOOKED.
###861 IN THE FIRST EXPERIMENT, AGAIN, DONE IN DARKNESS.
###865 THEY TOOK THE COLEOPTILE, WHICH WAS LACKING ITS TIP,
###871 AND THEY PUT A BLOCK OF AGAR ON SYMMETRICALLY,
###879 SYMMETRICALLY. AND IF YOU WAITED FOR SOME TIME, WHAT
###884 YOU FOUND IS THAT THIS GREW. GOT VERY BIG. SO, THIS
###891 WAS CONTRASTED WITH THE TIP WITH NO AGAR AND WAITED
###900 FOR TIME. GOT NO GROWTH. SO CLEARLY SOMETHING WAS
###905 COMING FROM THE AGAR. THE NEXT SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS
###912 WERE A LITTLE MORE CLEVER, A LITTLE MORE INTERESTING.
###915 THEY WERE ALSO DONE IN DARKNESS. AND, IN THESE
###918 EXPERIMENTS WHAT THEY DID, IS THEY TOOK A COLEOPTILE
###922 LIKE SO, COLEOPTILE LIKE SO, JUST AS YOU HAVE SEEN
###926 BEFORE, AGAIN IN DARKNESS AND NOW THEY PUT THE BLOCK
###932 ON ASYMMETRICALLY.
###941 ASYMMETRICALLY. AND THEY WAITED
###950 FACT, THE
###952 COLEOPTILE BENT, COLEOPTILE BENT, JUST LIKE IT WOULD
###957 IN THE LIGHT.
###964 SO FROM THIS EXPERIMENT THEY CONCLUDED
###969 SOMETHING MOVING ASYMMETRICALLY OUT OF THE BLOCK.
###984 STIMULATING DIFFERENTIAL GROWTH.
###997 AND THAT IS
###997 PRETTY EASY TO UNDERSTAND IF YOU LOOK CAREFULLY AT
###1001 THIS PICTURE HERE. BECAUSE THE BLOCK IS PLACED ON
###1004 ONLY PART OF THE COLEOPTILE, WHATEVER THIS
###1008 SUBSTANCE WAS WOULD ONLY MOVE DOWN PART OF THE
###1012 COLEOPTILE SIDE. AND, ACCORDING TO THIS IDEA, IT
###1015 WOULD STIMULATE DIFFERENTIAL GROWTH ONLY ON THE
###1018 SIDE WHERE THE SUBSTANCE WAS IN HIGHER
###1021 CONCENTRATION. EVERYBODY CLEAR ON THAT? FINALLY
###1025 THEY DID A THIRD EXPERIMENT WITH THESE COLEOPTILES.
###1029 AND THIS WAS NOW DONE IN USING UNILATERAL LIGHT.
###1038 AND THIS EXPERIMENT THEY TOOK AGAIN THE COLEOPTILE,
###1042 THEY HAD TAKEN OFF THE ORIGINAL TIP, THEY PUT THE
###1048 BLOCK ON SYMMETRICALLY NOW,
###1056 AND NOW THEY DID
###1061 LIGHT. THEY GAVE IT UNILATERAL LIGHT. IN THIS
###1072 PARTICULAR EXPERIMENT, IN THIS PARTICULAR
###1076 EXPERIMENT, WHAT THEY FOUND WAS THAT THE COLEOPTILE
###1082 BENT TOWARD THE LIGHT, EVEN THOUGH THE BLOCK WAS ON
###1085 SYMMETRICALLY, IT BENT TOWARD THE LIGHT. IF
###1090 A SUBSTANCE IS BEING PRODUCED SYMMETRICALLY, YOU
###1098 WOULD EXPECT THE COLEOPTILE TO GROW STRAIGHT IF YOU
###1102 PUT IT IN THE LIGHT, IF THE SUBSTANCE IS BEING
###1104 PRODUCED SYMMETRICALLY. BUT, IN FACT, WHAT THEY
###1108 FOUND WAS THAT EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE PUTTING THE
###1110 SUBSTANCE ON SYMMETRICALLY, THE COLEOPTILE BENT.
###1115 AND SO FROM THIS EXPERIMENT, THEY CONCLUDED THAT
###1121 LIGHT WAS CAUSING THE MOVEMENT OF THIS SUBSTANCE TO
###1138 THE SIDE OF THE COLEOPTILE AWAY FROM THE LIGHT.
###1162 IN
###1162 THIS SCENARIO THEN, WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE, AND I AM
###1165 JUST GOING TO DRAW THIS FOR YOU, IN THIS SCENARIO
###1167 WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE IS, YOU WOULD HAVE MORE OF THIS
###1171 
###1182 THIS IS WHY THE COLEOPTILE BENT, BECAUSE HERE YOU
###1185 HAD MORE GROWTH. THESE ARE VERY CENTRAL AND
###1192 IMPORTANT EXPERIMENTS. WHAT IS THIS SUBSTANCE?
###1196 OF COURSE, ONCE WE DEMONSTRATED SOME OF THE
###1199 PHYSIOLOGICAL CHARACTERS PEOPLE BEGAN TO LOOK FOR
###1202 WHAT IT WAS. THE AGAR WAS ANALYZED, CHEMICALLY,
###1205 AND OUT OF THE AGAR A COMPOUND INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID
###1215 OR ABBREVIATED AS IAA OR THE COMMON NAME IS AUXIN
###1221 WAS IDENTIFIED. THIS IS A LOW MOLECULAR WEIGHT
###1225 COMPOUND ABOUT LESS THAN 200 IN MOLECULAR WEIGHT.
###1230 IT WORKS IN LOW CONCENTRATIONS. WORKS IN LOW
###1235 CONCENTRATION AND AS WE SHOWED FROM BOTH THE INTACT
###1240 AND FROM THE EXPERIMENTS WHERE WE PUT THE
###1242 ASYMMETRIC BLOCK ON, THE RESPONSE IS SOMEPLACE
###1246 DIFFERENT FROM WHERE THE SUBSTANCE IS PRODUCED.
###1249 SO, WE HAVE A DIFFERENT, A DIFFERENT REGIONS OF
###1257 PRODUCTION AND RESPONSE. THE CHARACTERISTICS OF
###1266 
###1270 HAVE A REGION WHICH SYNTHESIZED AND WHICH DIFFERS
###1273 FROM THE REGION WHERE IT ACTUALLY CAUSES
###1275 A RESPONSE, BASICALLY DEFINES A HORMONE. AND SO IN
###1281 THE BEGINNING THE TERM HORMONE WAS APPLIED TO
###1284 AUXIN. BUT MOST PLANT BIOLOGISTS NOW PREFER NOT TO
###1288 USE THE WORD HORMONE, BUT INSTEAD CONSIDER AUXIN
###1292 AND OTHER MOLECULES LIKE IT THAT WE WILL TALK
###1294 ABOUT, PLANT GROWTH REGULATOR. AUXIN WAS THE FIRST
###1303 DISCOVERED PLANT GROWTH REGULATOR. IT CAUSES MANY,
###1307 MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF EFFECTS IN PLANTS. AND
###1310 WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO NOW IS TO GIVE YOU A TABLE
###1314 WITH SOME OF THE MORE PROMINENT EFFECTS OF AUXIN ON
###1317 GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. BUT THESE ARE REALLY ONLY
###1320 THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG. THE FIRST EFFECT IS KNOWN
###1324 AS APICAL DOMINANCE. IF YOU LOOK AT A TREE WHAT
###1333 YOU WILL FIND IS THE BRANCHES NEAREST THE TIP OF
###1336 THE TREE GROW OUT, NEAREST THE TIP OF THE TREE.
###1340 
###1345 THE TREE DO NOT GROW OUT. WHEREAS, BRANCHES TOWARD
###1348 THE BOTTOM DO GROW OUT. BRANCHES AT THE TOP ARE
###1352 INHIBITED.
###1363 THIS INHIBITION COMES ABOUT AND YOUR
###1366 BOOK DISCUSSES THIS IN MORE DETAIL, COMES ABOUT
###1368 BECAUSE THE APEX MAKES AUXIN. AND THIS INHIBITS
###1380 AXILLARY BUDS FROM GROWING OUT.
###1391 AND HERE WE HAVE SOME EXAMPLES OF APICAL
###1393 DOMINANCE. THIS IS AM IMPATIENCE PLANT GROWING HERE
###1396 ON THE CAMPUS. IN THIS PARTICULAR PLANT, THE APEX,
###1399 WHICH IS UP HIGHER AT THE TIP, HAS STRONG APICAL
###1403 DOMINANCE. AUXIN IS BEING PRODUCED AND IT IS MOVING
###1405 DOWN THE STEM AND IT IS INHIBITING APICAL DOMINANCE.
###1409 IF WE TAKE OFF THIS TIP, THAT IS, WE REMOVE THE SUPPLY
###1412 OF AUXIN OR AS HAPPENS IN NATURE, BY ACCIDENTS
###1416 SOMETIMES THE TIP BREAKS OFF, YOU CAN CAUSE THE
###1419 AXILLARY BUDS TO BECOME ACTIVE. AND THEY GROW OUT.
###1423 EACH OF THESE AXILLARY BUDS THEN HAS ITS OWN APEX.
###1425 
###1429 AXILLARY BUDS FROM GROWING OUT. APICAL DOMINANCE IS
###1432 ONE OF THE PRIME CHARACTERISTICS OF AUXIN. A SECOND
###1437 CHARACTERISTIC OF AUXIN IS THAT IT ACTIVATES AND
###1443 CONTROLS DIFFERENTIATION OF THE VASCULAR CAMBIUM. AND
###1456 WE HAVE SEEN THIS WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE VASCULAR
###1459 CAMBIUM, ALTHOUGH WE DIDN'T EXPLAIN WHAT THE BASIS OF
###1461 IT WAS. A THIRD ASPECT OF AUXIN, WHICH IS A MAJOR ONE
###1466 THAT WE WON'T TALK A LOT TODAY BUT WE WILL TALK ABOUT
###1469 MORE IN ANOTHER LECTURE, IS THAT AUXIN EFFECTS FRUIT
###1474 DEVELOPMENT.
###1484 A FOURTH MAJOR CATEGORY OF AUXIN EFFECTS
###1487 INCLUDE THE FACT THAT AUXIN STIMULATES THE PERICYCLE
###1496 TO MAKE LATERAL ROOTS. TO MAKE LATERAL ROOTS.
###1503 SO, FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE GARDENERS AND YOU
###1507 HAVE A CUTTING WHERE YOU TAKE A SHOOT OFF OF A PLANT
###1511 THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO PROPAGATE, LIKE WE TAKE THIS
###1514 SHOOT OFF AND WE WOULD LIKE TO GET THIS TO FORM ROOTS.
###1517 YOU CAN BUY COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE SYNTHETIC AUXINS.
###1520 
###1524 INTO THE POWDER AND THIS STIMULATES THE PRODUCTION OF
###1527 A PERICYCLE WITH LATERAL ROOT FORMATION. EVENTUALLY
###1531 YOU MIGHT GET NEW ROOTS FORMING BUT THEY WOULD TAKE A
###1534 LONGER TIME. SO, AUXIN STIMULATES ROOT FORMULATION.
###1538 A 5TH MAJOR CATEGORY OF AUXIN EFFECTS IS THAT AUXIN
###1545 AFFECTS THE DROPPING OR AS WE SAY IN BIOLOGY, THE
###1551 ABSCISSION OF LEAVES. A DROPPING OR THE ABSCISSION OF
###1560 LEAVES. AND MOST OF YOU HAVE NOTICED THAT IN FALL OR
###1564 WINTER THE TREES THAT ARE TYPICALLY GOING TO LOSE
###1568 THEIR LEAVES HAVE BEGUN TO SHED THEIR LEAVES. HOW IS
###1571 IT THAT THE TREE KNOWS THAT WINTER IS COMING ALONG AND
###1575 IT IS TIME TO SHED THE LEAF? WELL, IT COULD MEASURE
###1577 THE TEMPERATURE OUTSIDE AND SAY, IT IS GETTING COLDER
###1579 SO I SHOULD DROP THE LEAF. BUT, YOU KNOW SOMETIMES
###1582 THE TEMPERATURE IS NOT COLD. SOMETIMES IT IS A WARM
###1585 FALL OR A WARM WINTER. SO WHAT THE TREE DOES IN FACT,
###1589 IT MEASURES THE AMOUNT OF LIGHT. AND WHEN THE LIGHT
###1592 
###1595 YEAR, WHAT THAT DOES IS TRIGGER A DROP IN AUXIN
###1600 PRODUCTION IN THE LEAVES. LESS LIGHT YIELDS A DROP IN
###1607 AUXIN OR IAA PRODUCTION IN THE LEAF. AND THIS IS
###1615 A SIGNAL FOR THE LEAVES TO BEGIN TO TRANSPORT THE
###1622 MATERIALS IN THE FORM OF FOODS TO THE REST OF THE
###1626 PLANT AND A SIGNAL FOR THE LEAF TO BEGIN TO ABSCISE.
###1630 THE FINAL OF THE MANY CHARACTERISTICS THAT AUXIN IS
###1634 INVOLVED WITH THAT I WANT TO GIVE YOU HAS TO DO WITH
###1638 THE ORIENTATION OF PLANTS. IF I TAKE THIS PLANT HERE
###1649 AND I LAY IT ON ITS SIDE YOU KNOW FROM YOUR EXPERIENCE
###1653 THAT EVENTUALLY THE SHOOT IS GOING TO START GROWING UP
###1657 AND IS GOING TO REORIENTATE ITS DIRECTION WITH REGARD
###1660 TO GRAVITY. HOW IS AUXIN INVOLVED IN THIS
###1663 REORIENTATION OF THE SHOOT WITH REGARD TO GRAVITY?
###1667 WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO THEN IS TO TAKE THIS STEM,
###1670 WHICH IS UPRIGHT NOW, AND NOW ROTATE IT 90 DEGREES.
###1675 ROTATE THIS STEM 90 DEGREES WHICH IS WHAT WE HAVE DONE
###1678 
###1681 THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION WHEN WE TURN THE STEM 90
###1685 DEGREES, WHAT WE FIND HAPPENING IS THAT AUXIN MOVES TO
###1692 THE LOWER SURFACE.
###1698 MOVES TO THE LOWER SURFACE AND
###1701 THERE IT STIMULATES GROWTH.
###1715 SO, WITH TIME WE GET THIS
###1719 SHOOT TO GROW UP, THE SHOOT TO GROW UP. YOU HAVE MORE
###1726 GROWTH HERE, MORE GROWTH ON THE LOWER SURFACE THAN THE
###1730 UPPER SURFACE AND THAT IS DUE TO THE HIGHER
###1734 CONCENTRATION OF AUXIN. HOW ABOUT A ROOT? WHAT
###1741 HAPPENS IN THE ROOT IF WE REORIENT THE ROOT TO THE
###1744 HORIZONTAL? IF WE TAKE A ROOT NOW AND WE TAKE THIS
###1749 ROOT AND WE ORIENTATE THE HORIZONTAL, THE SAME THING
###1753 IS GOING TO HAPPEN. AUXIN IS GOING TO MOVE TO THE
###1756 LOWER SURFACE OF THE ROOT. BUT THE ROOT DOESN'T GROW
###1760 UP. THE ROOT GROWS DOWN. SO, WE WAIT FOR SOME TIME.
###1767 WE FIND THAT THE ROOT GROWS DOWN EVEN THOUGH THERE IS
###1772 MORE AUXIN HERE.
###1779 THE BACKSIDE HAS MORE GROWTH. IN
###1782 THIS PARTICULAR CASE, IN THE ROOT, HIGH AUXIN INHIBITS
###1789 
###1800 SO, THIS BRINGS
###1801 UP A QUESTION, I HAVE GIVEN YOU ONLY 5 OR 6 DIFFERENT
###1805 THINGS THAT ARE REGULATED BY AUXIN, BUT WE KNOW THAT
###1807 THERE ARE HUNDREDS, PROBABLY THOUSANDS OF THINGS
###1809 REGULATED BY AUXIN IN THE PLANT. HOW IS THE PLANT
###1813 ABLE TO DECIDE WHICH PROCESSES IT WANTS TO GO AND
###1816 WHICH PROCESSES SHOULD NOT BE GOING AT THE TIME?
###1819 THIS PICTURE OVER HERE WILL ILLUSTRATE FOR YOU ONE OF
###1823 THE WAYS IN WHICH THE PLANT DECIDED WHICH PROCESSES IT
###1826 IS GOING TO DO. AND SO I WOULD LIKE TO ILLUSTRATE
###1828 THAT FOR YOU IN THIS GRAPH OVER HERE. ON THIS AXIS WE
###1833 WILL PUT ELONGATION. ELONGATION. AND ON THE X AXIS,
###1841 WE ARE GOING TO PUT AUXIN CONCENTRATION, WHICH IS
###1846 INCREASING IN THIS DIRECTION. HERE WILL BE
###1851 STIMULATION OF ELONGATION. AND HERE WILL BE
###1857 INHIBITION. AND HERE WILL BE NO AFFECT. NOW, LET'S
###1867 PUT A ROOT ON THIS CURVE, WHICH HAS DIFFERENT AUXIN
###1872 CONCENTRATIONS. TO PUT THE ROOT ON, WHAT WE FIND IS
###1876 
###1878 LEVELS OF AUXIN. AND THEN AS WE BEGIN TO INCREASE THE
###1881 LEVELS OF AUXIN, WE BEGIN TO STIMULATE ELONGATION IN
###1886 THE ROOT AND AS THE CONCENTRATIONS BEGIN TO BECOME
###1890 HIGHER WE BEGIN TO RETURN TO THE NO AFFECT LINE AND WE
###1894 AGAIN TO INHIBIT ELONGATION IN THE ROOT. SO THIS IS
###1899 THE ROOT. HOW ABOUT THE SHOOT NOW. IF WE LOOK TO SEE
###1905 HOW THE SHOOT IS AFFECTED BY INCREASING
###1907 CONCENTRATIONS, WHAT WE FIND WITH THE SHOOT IS AGAIN,
###1910 LOW CONCENTRATIONS GIVE NO AFFECT AND NOW THE
###1915 INTERESTING THING IS THAT YOU DON'T BEGIN TO SEE THE
###1918 EFFECT OF THE AUXIN UNTIL YOU GET TO MUCH HIGHER
###1922 CONCENTRATIONS. TO MUCH HIGHER CONCENTRATION. WHAT
###1929 THIS ILLUSTRATES TO YOU IS THAT ONE OF THE WAYS AUXIN
###1932 CAN HAVE SO MANY DIFFERENT AFFECTS IN A PLANT IS THAT
###1936 BY CHANGING ITS CONCENTRATION IT CAN HAVE A DRAMATIC
###1940 AFFECT. FOR EXAMPLE, AT THIS CONCENTRATION OF AUXIN
###1944 HERE, WHATEVER IT HAPPENS TO BE, X, WE CAN STIMULATE
###1947 
###1952 THAT CONCENTRATION. THEY ARE IN NO WAY AFFECTED. SO
###1955 BY CHANGING CONCENTRATIONS OF THIS AUXIN, YOU CAN
###1959 CONTROL DIFFERENT AFFECTS. THIS IS THE BASIS FOR THE
###1963 PRODUCTION OF HERBICIDES. THERE ARE HERBICIDES WHICH
###1967 ARE MADE, FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU HAVE A LAWN OF GRASS,
###1971 AND YOU WANT TO GET RID OF THE DANDELIONS, WHICH ARE
###1974 EUDICOTS GROWING IN YOUR LAWN OF MONOCOTS, YOU CAN
###1978 SPRAY YOUR LAWN WITH A CONCENTRATION OF AN HERBICIDE
###1981 WHICH IS AN AUXIN ANALOG, LOOKS LIKE AUXIN. AND THE
###1985 DANDELIONS WILL BE KILLED BUT THE GRASS WILL NOT. AND
###1990 YOU CAN SUBSTANCE ON THIS CURVE HERE DANDELION AND
###1997 GRASS. THAT IS, YOU CAN CHOOSE A CONCENTRATION OF
###2002 AUXIN TO WHICH WOULD BE POISONOUS TO THE DANDELION,
###2008 BUT HAVE MINIMUM EFFECT ON THE GRASS. SO, THIS IS THE
###2012 BASIS FOR HERBICIDES THAT HAVE SELECTIVITY AND AUXINS
###2016 AND AUXIN ANALOGS ARE ONE OF THE MAIN TYPES OF
###2019 HERBICIDES THAT ARE USED. OKAY, LET ME SHOW YOU
###2021 
###2025 FIND MY POINTER WHICH I PROBABLY CAN'T. WELL, NO
###2029 POINTER, WE ARE OUT OF LUCK. OKAY. THIS FIRST ONE IS
###2032 A SLIDE OF DARWIN'S HOME, HIS ROOM, WHICH I HAVE BEEN
###2036 TOLD IS EXACTLY THIS WAY IN ENGLAND. IF YOU GO THERE
###2041 NOW THIS IS THE WAY YOU WILL FIND IT. I GOT IT. HE
###2044 DID HIS EXPERIMENTS PRESUMABLY IN THIS ROOM AND HE
###2047 COVERED THE BLINDS, PULLED THE CURTAINS. THIS IS THE
###2050 BOOK THAT HE PUBLISHED WITH FRANCIS. THIS IS A U.C.
###2052 BOOK. AND AS I SAID THERE ARE MANY, SEVERAL COPIES IN
###2055 OUR LIBRARY AND IT IS CERTAINLY WORTHWHILE HAVING
###2057 A LOOK AT IT. THESE ARE THE KINDS OF EXPERIMENTS
###2060 DARWIN DID. HE TOOK A CANDLE AND HE COVERED VARIOUS
###2064 PORTIONS OF THE COLEOPTILE. HERE HE PUT A BLACK PAPER
###2067 OVER IT. OR HERE HE PUT A SHEET, WHICH INTERCEPTED
###2070 THE LIGHT THAT CAME BELOW THIS LEVEL. WAS ABLE TO
###2073 SHOW THAT IT IS THE TIP OF THE COLEOPTILE WHICH IS
###2076 RESPONDING TO THE LIGHT AND THAT WAS THE PORTION THAT
###2079 
###2082 COLEOPTILE TIPS OFF, PUT THEM IN AGAR AND THIS IS TO
###2086 SHOW YOU THE EXPERIMENT. MANY AGAR BLOCKS WERE
###2089 COLLECTED AND THEN THEY WERE SUBSTITUTED FOR THE
###2092 REGULAR COLEOPTILE TIP AND AN ANGLE WAS MEASURED AND
###2096 THAT ANGLE TOLD YOU SOMETHING ABOUT THE CONCENTRATION
###2098 OF THE HORMONE. THESE ARE THE WAY THE EXPERIMENTS ARE
###2102 RUN. THESE ARE COLEOPTILES. THE AGAR IS PUT ON THE
###2105 BACK, NOT EXACTLY ON THE TOP. THEY USED TO DO ARMIES
###2108 OF THESE COLEOPTILES WHERE YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO DO
###2112 THESE EXPERIMENTS. HERE WE HAVE AN EXAMPLE, AGAIN, OF
###2114 STRONG APICAL DOMINANCE IN WHICH THE PALM TREE HAS
###2117 ONLY ONE MAJOR APEX GROWING OUT. NO AXILLARY BUDS ARE
###2120 GROWING OUT. AS CONTRASTED WITH THIS PLANT OVER HERE,
###2124 WHICH IS IN AFRICA, IN WHICH YOU CAN'T REALLY PROBABLY
###2127 FIND WHAT USED TO BE THE MAIN APEX. THIS HAS WEAK
###2129 APICAL DOMINANCE. HERE IS AN EXAMPLE NOW OF A
###2133 CAMELLIA WHICH HAS BEEN DIPPED IN SYNTHETIC AUXIN
###2136 
###2139 WAS NOT PUT INTO THIS SOLUTION. SHOOT SYSTEM TURNED
###2143 ON ITS SIDE RESULTS IN HIGHER AUXIN CONCENTRATION ON
###2146 THE LOWER SURFACE WHERE WE GET MORE GROWTH AND THE
###2149 SHOOT COMES UPRIGHT. AS CONTRASTED WITH A ROOT SYSTEM
###2153 IN WHICH, IF YOU TAKE THE ROOT, PUT IT HORIZONTALLY,
###2155 THE ROOT BENDS DOWN. AGAIN, BECAUSE OF MORE AUXIN ON
###2158 THE LOWER SURFACE. BUT BECAUSE THE LOWER SURFACE
###2160 IS INHIBITED RELATIVE TO THE UPPER SURFACE. THIS
###2163 PICTURE TAKEN OUTSIDE BEFORE THE STAIRWAY WENT IN IN
###2167 THE SOUTH, SHOWS A TREE ALONG CAMPANILE WAY WHICH WAS
###2171 NEXT TO A LIGHT. AND WHAT I WANT TO SHOW YOU IS, AS
###2174 FAR AS THIS TREE WAS CONCERNED THE WINTER AND FALL
###2177 REALLY HASN'T COME BECAUSE THE PERIOD OF LIGHT
###2180 REMAINED CONSTANT. AND SO, THE LEAVES STAYED ON THIS
###2182 SIDE OF THE TREE. AUXIN CONCENTRATION CONTINUED WHERE
###2186 AS, THE SIDE OF THE TREE AWAY FROM THE LIGHT
###2188 EXPERIENCED LESS LIGHT AND AS FAR AS THAT TREE WAS
###2191 
###2197 OKAY. SO THOSE ARE THE AUXINS, THE FIRST GROUP
###2199 HISTORICALLY OF PLANT GROWTH REGULATORS. NOW, WHILE
###2202 THE WORK WAS GOING ON WITH AUXINS, THE JAPANESE BEGAN
###2206 TO STUDY A DISEASE WHICH WAS CAUSING RICE PLANTS TO
###2209 BECOME VERY, VERY TALL AND SPINDLY. THE DISEASE
###2212 CAUSED BY A FUNGUS AND WHEN THE WIND CAME ALONG THE
###2216 RICE PLANTS WERE BLOWN OVER AND THE HEADS OF RICE WERE
###2219 LOST BECAUSE THEY WERE INTO THE WATER. THE JAPANESE
###2222 FROM THIS WORK DISCOVERED THAT THE FINANCING US WAS
###2225 ABLE TO CAUSE THIS ELONGATION, THIS GROWTH OF THE RICE
###2228 STEMS BECAUSE THE FUNGUS PRODUCED A SUBSTANCE WHICH
###2234 THEY LATER IDENTIFIED AS GIBBERELLIC ACID OR AS IT IS
###2243 ABBREVIATED GA. OR GIBBERELLINS AS IT IS SOMETIMES
###2249 CALLED. WE NOW KNOW THAT GIBBERELLINS ARE NATURALLY,
###2257 EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE FOUND DUE TO A FUNGUS THEY WERE
###2259 ALSO NATURALLY OCCURRING PLANT GROWTH REGULATORS. THE
###2272 JAPANESE WORK WAS NOT WELL KNOWN IN THE UNITED STATES
###2276 
###2280 OF LANGUAGE DIFFICULTIES, PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE HIS OF
###2283 WORLD WAR II. BUT ONCE THESE OBSERVATIONS WERE MADE
###2287 KNOWN TO BOTH EUROPEANS AND THE AMERICANS, A LOT OF
###2291 WORK THEN WENT IN TO CHARACTERIZING THE GIBBERELLINS
###2295 OR GIBBERELLIC ACID. AND THERE ARE PROBABLY OVER 100
###2298 DIFFERENT TYPES OF GIBBERELLINS. AGAIN, A LOW
###2301 MOLECULAR WEIGHT SUBSTANCE WHICH WORKS IN LOW
###2304 CONCENTRATION AND HAS PROFOUND EFFECTS ON PLANT
###2307 DEVELOPMENT. THE FIRST EFFECT THAT I WANT TO GIVE YOU
###2311 WITH REGARD TO GIBBERELLINS IS THAT IT STIMULATES,
###2314 WHICH IS THE BASIS OF ITS DISCOVERY, SELF-ELONGATION.
###2318 SO THESE ARE CHARACTERISTICS. THESE ARE GIBBERELLIN
###2327 CHARACTERISTICS. STIMULATES CELL ELONGATION. AND,
###2337 LET ME SHOW YOU SOME EXAMPLES OF HOW WE COMMERCIALLY
###2339 USE GIBBERELLINS. THESE ARE GRAPES. MOST OF
###2344 YOU BUY GRAPES IN THE STORE AND NEXT TIME
###2346 YOU BUY A GRAPE LOOK AT THE GRAPE CAREFULLY AND LOOK
###2349 
###2352 ELONGATED AS THESE ARE. IF THE GRAPE IS ELONGATED,
###2358 CHANCES ARE THAT THE FARMER OR THE PERSON WHO WAS
###2360 GROWING THESE GRAPES SPRAYED HIS CROP OR HER CROP WITH
###2364 GIBBERELLINS. IN DOING SO, THE CELLS OF THE GRAPE
###2367 ELONGATED, MORE WATER WAS TAKEN INTO THE GRAPE. THE
###2371 NUTRITIONAL CONTENT OF THE GRAPE HASN'T INCREASED.
###2374 YOU PAY MORE FOR IT THOUGH, BECAUSE YOU ARE PAYING FOR
###2376 MORE WATER. GIBBERELLINS CAN BE USED. THEY ARE NOT
###2380 CONSIDERED TO BE CHEMICALS BECAUSE THEY ARE NATURALLY
###2383 OCCURRING PLANT GROWTH SUBSTANCES TO WHICH WE HAVE
###2385 BEEN EXPOSED THROUGHOUT OUR ENTIRE EVOLUTION. A LESS,
###2390 ONE THAT MIGHT NOT BOTHER YOU SO MUCH IS FOUND IN
###2392 CAMELLIA FLOWERS. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE FRIENDS
###2394 WHO GROW CAMELLIA'S, WHEN CAMELLIA SHOWS ARE HELD, AND
###2397 THEY ARE NOW BEING HELD THIS TIME OF YEAR IN NORTHERN
###2399 CALIFORNIA, PEOPLE LIKE GIANT FLOWERS. AND ONE OF THE
###2402 WAYS THEY DO IT IS BY SPRAYING THE FLOWERS WITH
###2405 
###2411 IN THE FLOWER ELONGATE TO GIVE THESE GIANT ENLARGED
###2414 CELLS. SO, THESE ARE SOME EFFECTS THAT YOU WOULD FIND
###2420 FROM GIBBERELLINS. NOW WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO IS
###2422 TALK TO YOU ABOUT A FEW OTHER EFFECTS. THE SECOND
###2425 EFFECT IS THAT GIBBERELLINS CONTROL FLOWERING. AND WE
###2430 ARE GOING TO SPEND SOME TIME TALKING ABOUT HOW THEY
###2434 CONTROL FLOWERING AT THE LECTURE WHICH IS THE SECOND
###2438 ONE TO THE LAST. THE THIRD ASPECT, WHICH I WANTED TO
###2443 MENTION TO YOU, WHICH IS REALLY PROBABLY THE MOST
###2446 FASCINATING, BUT CERTAINLY THE LEAST UNDERSTOOD IS
###2448 THAT GIBBERELLINS CONTROL THE PHASE OF LIFE OF PLANTS.
###2454 NOW WHAT DO I MEAN, PHASE OF LIFE THE PLANTS? I HAVE
###2462 A COUPLE EXAMPLES HERE THAT ALL OF YOU ARE FAMILIAR
###2464 WITH. IF YOU GO OUTSIDE AND YOU LOOK IN THE
###2468 EUCALYPTUS GROVE YOU LOOK CAREFULLY YOU WILL SEE THAT
###2470 EUCALYPTUS TREE PRODUCES TWO TYPES OF BRANCHES AND TWO
###2474 TYPES OF LEAVES. ON YOUR LEFT HERE, THIS IS A TYPE IN
###2478 
###2481 FROM THIS TYPE HERE. THESE ARE BOTH ON THE SAME TREE.
###2484 THERE IS NO PETIOLE ON THIS ONE. THE LEAVES ARE MUCH
###2487 WIDER. THESE LEAVES HAVE PETIOLES. THESE LEAVES ARE
###2490 MUCH NARROWER. YOU CAN MAKE ROOTING. YOU CAN MAKE
###2494 CUTTINGS OF THIS PARTICULAR ONE. YOU CAN'T MAKE
###2497 CUTTINGS OF THIS ONE. THIS ONE OVER HERE WILL PRODUCE
###2499 FLOWERS. THIS ONE WILL NOT PRODUCE FLOWERS.
###2503 THESE CHARACTERISTICS OF BEING ABLE TO ROOT IT
###2506 AND NOT PRODUCING FLOWERS MAKES THIS A JUVENILE PHASE.
###2509 SO, GIBBERELLINS ARE INVOLVED WITH THE JUVENILE OR THE
###2513 SO-CALLED ADULT PHASE OF EUCALYPTUS. SO LET'S PUT
###2516 THIS DOWN HERE. THE TWO PHASES ARE JUVENILE, AND THIS
###2522 CAPACITY OR ABILITY TO STIMULATE THE PHASE OF
###2526 DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN USED EXPERIMENTALLY. HERE IS
###2529 ANOTHER EXAMPLE, AND I HOPE THAT YOU GUYS WHEN YOU
###2532 LOOK AT IVY WILL LOOK AT THESE PARTS. HERE IS
###2535 JUVENILE IVY. JUVENILE IVY GROWS PROCUMBENT PARALLEL
###2540 
###2542 A PIECE, IT WILL ROOT. IF YOU TRY TO GET THIS TO
###2545 FLOWER IT WON'T FLOWER. WHEREAS, ADULT IVY, HAS
###2550 A DIFFERENT LEAF SHAPE. IT GROWS UPRIGHT. IF YOU
###2554 BREAK OFF A PIECE IT WON'T ROOT. BUT IT WILL FLOWER.
###2558 IF YOU TAKE THIS ADULT AND YOU SPRAY IT WITH
###2562 GIBBERELLIC ACID YOU CAN CONVERT IT BACK TO THIS
###2566 JUVENILE FORM HERE. ONE SUBSTANCE BEING ABLE TO DO
###2568 THAT. PRETTY REMARKABLE. FINALLY, THE LAST ASPECT I
###2573 WANT TO MENTION TO YOU ABOUT GIBBERELLINS OF THE MANY
###2575 AGAIN THAT THEY CONTROL. IS THAT GIBBERELLINS ARE
###2578 INVOLVED IN BREAKING SEED DORMANCY OR IN GERMINATION.
###2600 IN CLIMATES LIKE OURS WHERE WE HAVE A -- OR EVEN IN
###2604 CLIMATES THAT ARE MUCH WORSE THAN OURS, WHERE WE HAVE
###2607 AT A PERIOD OF TIME WHERE THE CLIMATE OUTSIDE IS NOT
###2609 GOOD FOR SEEDS TO GROW, THEY BECOME DORMANT AND THEY
###2613 HAVE A DORMANCY IMPOSED UPON THEM SO THEY DON'T
###2615 GERMINATE AND DIE UNDER UNFAVORABLE CONDITIONS. BUT
###2618 
###2621 THE NATURAL DORMANCY IS INVOLVED OR CONTROLLED BY
###2625 GIBBERELLINS. AND I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE YOU THE STEPS
###2628 THAT ARE INVOLVED IN THE BREAKING OF DORMANCY IN
###2630 A SEED. SO LET'S MAKE A TYPICAL SEED AND WE WILL
###2634 START OUT WITH A SEED BECAUSE I AM GOING TO SHOW YOU
###2636 SOME PICTURES OF THIS, OF BARLEY. WHICH IS A MONOCOT.
###2641 IT HAS AN EMBRYO. IT HAS GOT THE ENDOSPERM. AND I AM
###2652 GOING TO ADD ONE NEW LAYER ON TO THIS THAT YOU HAVEN'T
###2654 SEEN BEFORE. THAT NEW LAYER IS CALLED, IT SURROUNDS
###2660 THE ENDOSPERM, IT IS CALLED THE ALEURINE LAYER, THE
###2668 ALEURINE LAYER. HOW DOES DORMANCY GET BROKEN? SO,
###2677 THE VERY FIRST THING WHICH HAPPENS IS THAT THE EMBRYO,
###2681 AND WE WILL TALK ABOUT WHAT THIS IS, RECEIVES
###2683 A SIGNAL.
###2689 ONCE IT RECEIVES THIS SIGNAL, THE EMBRYO
###2692 EITHER RELEASES OR RELEASES AND MAKES GA. THE GA MAY
###2702 BE THERE OR MAY HAVE TO BE MADE BEFORE IT IS RELEASED.
###2709 THE GA MOVES TO THE ALEURINE LAYER
###2717 WHERE IT STIMULATES
###2735 THAT
###2736 ENZYME IS ALPHA AMYLASE.
###2743 AND FINALLY THE ALPHA
###2745 AMYLASE CONVERTS THIS STARCH TO SUGAR. AND THEN THE
###2762 SEED GERMINATES. COMMERCIALLY, GIBBERELLINS ARE OF
###2772 EXTREME IMPORTANCE WITH REGARD TO THIS PROCESS. THIS
###2776 ALLOWS US TO GERMINATE SEEDS THAT ARE IN DEEP DORMANCY
###2778 ANY TIME WE WANT. BUT, PROBABLY FOR MANY OF YOU IN
###2782 THE AUDIENCE, I WILL SAY MALE AND I KNOW THIS IS
###2784 SEXIST. MANY OF YOU IN THE AUDIENCE, GA'S HAVE
###2788 A SPECIAL FONDNESS BECAUSE GA'S ARE USED TO TREAT THE
###2792 GRAINS OUT OF WHICH BEER IS MADE AND ALE IS MADE.
###2797 GRAIN, WHICH IS TO BE FERMENTED AND TO GIVE THE BEER
###2801 ITS ALCOHOLIC TASTE IS TREATED WITH GA AND THE GA
###2807 CAUSES THE ENDOSPERM TO CONVERT FROM STARCH TO SUGAR
###2810 AND WHEN THIS OCCURS THAT CONVERSION FROM STARCH TO
###2813 SUGAR IS CALLED THE MALT. TO THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE
###2817 EVER, IN SEEING THAT TERM, THE MALT. ONCE THE SEEDS
###2822 HAVE BEEN TREATED WITH GA, AND THE ENDOSPERM HAS BEEN
###2825 
###2829 BEGINS. LET ME SHOW YOU A FEW SLIDES NOW OF GA'S.
###2834 THIS FIRST SLIDE WILL SHOW YOU A, POINTER ALWAYS SEEMS
###2839 TO DISAPPEAR BUT THAT IS OKAY. THE FIRST SLIDE WILL
###2841 SHOW YOU A CABBAGE PLANT AND IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE
###2844 THE CABBAGE PLANT WAS SPRAYED WITH GA. AND IN THIS
###2848 CASE NOT ONLY DID CELL ELONGATION OCCUR BUT WE ALSO
###2851 CAUSED THE CABBAGE PLANT TO BEGIN TO FLOWER. THE NEXT
###2855 SLIDE SHOWS THE IVY. ON YOUR LEFT IS THE JUVENILE
###2859 IVY, WHERE TYPICAL IVY LEAF AND ON THE RIGHT IS THE
###2863 ADULT IVY WHICH WILL PRODUCE FLOWERS. AND TO SHOW YOU
###2866 WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE, HERE IS AN ADULT IVY PLANT
###2869 GROWING UPRIGHT. NOTICE HOW THE LEAVES ARE VERY
###2871 DIFFERENT FROM THE TYPICAL IVY LEAF. AND YOU ARE
###2874 PRODUCING FLOWERS UP AT THE TOP. IF YOU TAKE THIS
###2877 ADULT IVY PLANT NOW HAVING PRODUCED FLOWERS AND YOU
###2881 NOW SPRAY WITH GA, YOU CAN CAUSE THE PLANT TO RESUME
###2885 THE JUVENILE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE IVY INCLUDING
###2891 ITS LEAF
###2891 SHAPE. HERE IS SOME GRAPES NOW, JUST TO SHOW YOU WHAT
###2894 HAPPENS. THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF GRAPES WHICH HAVE BEEN
###2898 TREATED WITH GA. AND IN THIS EXAMPLE YOU CAN SEE THE
###2900 GRAPES ARE VERY ELONGATED. AND THIS ELONGATION IS DUE
###2903 TO CELLS ELONGATING BUT NOT INCREASING ANY MORE OF THE
###2907 VALUE NUTRITIONALLY OF THE GRAPE. SEED GERMINATION,
###2911 THIS IS OF A PINE SEEDLING. A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT
###2913 BUT I JUST WANTED TO INDICATE THAT MANY SEEDS HAVE
###2915 DORMANCY. MANY SEEDS PROBABLY INVOLVE A GA TYPE
###2919 MECHANISM. AND THE LAST SLIDE SOME OF YOU PAY HAVE
###2921 ACTUALLY SEEN THIS IF YOU HAVE EVER BEEN TO A BEER
###2924 MAKING INSTITUTE. HERE WE HAVE THE BARLEY SEEDS WHICH
###2928 ARE BEING PLACED INTO A LARGE ROOM. THEY HAVE ALREADY
###2931 BEEN CONVERTED TO THE MALT OR THEY ARE GOING TO BE
###2933 SPRAYED WITH THE GA TO BE CONVERTED TO THE MALT. AND,
###2936 IF YOU LOOK IN THESE ROOMS YOU WILL FIND MANY, MANY OF
###2939 THESE SEEDS THEY ARE BEING TREATED WITH GA AND THEN IN
###2943 
###2946 HAVE HAD THE ENDOSPERMS CONVERTED FROM STARCH TO SUGAR
###2950 AND THESE ARE NOW READY TO BE USED IN THE BREWING OR
###2954 THE FERMENTING PORTION OF MAKING BEER.
###2955 WE WILL CONTINUE WITH THE GROWTH REGULATORS ON
###2958 FRIDAY.
