###1 CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: You`ve got one day before the U.S. chooses its leader for the
###4 next four years. You`ve got one hour of extra sleep thanks to a time switch, and we`ve got
###8 one show that will bring you coverage of both events in the next ten minutes. Welcome to
###13 CNN STUDENT NEWS.
###15 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
###18 BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: After four years as president,
###30 you know me.
###31 AUDIENCE: Yes!
###32 OBAMA: You may not agree with every decision I`ve made, you may at times have been frustrated
###37 by the pace of change, but you know what I believe. You know where I stand. You know
###42 I tell the truth. And you know I`ll fight for you and your families every single day.
###46 MITT ROMNEY, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The same path we`re on means $20 trillion
###50 in debt in four years. It means crippling unemployment continues. It means stagnant
###55 take home pay, depressed home values. And a devastated military.
###60 OBAMA: Our fight goes on, Virginia, because -- because we know this nation can`t succeed
###64 without a growing, thriving middle class.
###71 Our fight goes on because America`s always done best when everybody has a fair shot.
###76 And everybody is doing their fair share, and everybody is playing by the same rules.
###80 ROMNEY: If you believe we can do better ...
###82 (cheers)
###82 ROMNEY: If you believe America should be on a better course ...
###85 AUDIENCE: Yes!
###86 ROMNEY: If you are tired of being tired ...
###88 AUDIENCE: Yes!
###89 ROMNEY: Then I ask you to vote and work for real change, because Paul Ryan and I are going
###94 to bring real change to America from the day one.
###97 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###98 AZUZ: If you think there were a lot of stops on that map, it`s not even the half of it.
###102 Ohio, Wisconsin, Virginia, Colorado, Iowa, New Hampshire, Florida, Pennsylvania -- the
###108 candidates are campaigning hard in states that could go either way tomorrow. One of
###113 the things that we are talking about this weekend was a report that came out on Friday.
###116 It said the U.S. economy added 171,000 jobs in October. But that the nation`s unemployment
###123 rate went up slightly, to 7.9 percent. The candidates focused on different parts of that
###129 report. President Obama referred to the added jobs and said it shows that the economy is
###133 improving. Governor Romney looked at the unemployment rate and said it shows the economy is at a
###138 standstill. The CNN election center is packed with interactive resources that can help you
###144 get geared up for election day. Check this out.

###147 MANAV TANNEERU, SENIOR PRODUCER, CNN.COM: This is Manav Tanneeru, I`m a senior producer
###149 at CNN.COM. And I`m here to tell you about a couple of features we have at out Web site,
###153 that might help you get a better idea about the election that`s coming around. One of
###160 them is what we call the CNN electoral map. It allows you to game out the presidential
###165 race by assigning different states to different candidates. The point of it is, to see who
###170 gets the 270 electoral votes first. Now, after you make your selection and you come with
###176 a prediction, you can share with the family and friends, the social media, email, different
###182 methods.
###182 Another feature we have is called the CNN Campaign Explorer. We work with Google on
###187 this feature. And it shows you different types of data. It allows you to take a glance at
###192 fundraising data, ad spending data, candidate travel, and also polling. The last feature
###198 we have is our polling interactive. It shows you CNN poll of polls for the national race
###203 and different battleground states like Ohio, and Florida and Colorado and Nevada. States
###208 you have heard a lot about in this presidential election.

###247 AZUZ: It`s been one week since the storm Sandy hit land. You`ve seen pictures of the devastation,
###263 but what`s incredible, is to compare it to what these areas looked like before the storm.
###269 Like this New Jersey Pier, before totally intact, after parts of it just ripped away.
###274 We are seeing these kinds of before and after images from up and down the coast. Originally,
###280 analysts were predicting that Sandy might cause $10 billion to $20 billion in damages.
###284 Now, they are estimating between 30 and 50 billion. The victims of these storm are dealing
###289 with all kinds of challenges, some things are starting to get back to normal. For example,
###294 New York City`s public schools are opening back up today. But millions of people still
###298 didn`t have power yesterday. No power means no heat, and with the temperature dropping
###303 New York officials say tens of thousands of people will have to find other housing options.
###308 Gasoline has also been in short supply. The U.S. Defense Department is planning to bring
###313 more in, but some residents have stood in line for hours waiting to fill up.
###317 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
###318 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We saw the truck pulling here, we are like, get the cans out, because
###322 it`s better than waiting in the car.
###324 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I ran out of gas, looking for gas. So I walked here.
###327 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right now, I`m just kind of waiting it out. I think in a few more days,
###330 hopefully, there will be fuel and all the stuff will ease up.
###333 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###333 AZUZ: New York City`s subway tunnels were flooded during the storm. System is coming
###337 back online, but when Jason Carroll went to look at the damage with the subway official,
###342 he found out some sections still need a lot of work.
###344 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
###345 JASON CARROLL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: What is it exactly that you`ll be doing down here,
###348 because this is in the area clearly were you are working now. I mean it`s ...
###351 FRANK JEZYCKI, CHIEF INFRASTRUCTURE OFFICER, MTA: Well, the station complex itself will
###354 require a significant rehabilitation due to the damage from the storm. The infrastructure
###363 -- the electrical systems, the fare collection systems. The lighting systems. The stairways,
###371 the ventilation systems, the elevators, the escalators, they are all pretty much ruined
###376 from the water damage, from the surge damage.
###379 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
###380 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Today`s "Shoutout" goes out to Ms. Holt`s classes at Westbrook Walnut
###385 Grove High School in Westbrook, Minnesota. During which war did the U.S. first practice
###391 daylight-saving time? Here we go, was it the Civil War, World War One, Spanish-American
###398 War or World War II? You`ve got three seconds, go!
###406 The U.S. first observed daylight saving time during World War I. That`s your answer and
###413 that`s your "Shoutout."
###415 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###417 AZUZ: But the idea of daylight saving goes back further than that. Back in the 1700s,
###422 Ben Franklin suggested getting up earlier in order to use fewer candles. So that covers
###427 the who and the when. As for why and where this happens around the world, here is Reynolds
###431 Wolf.
###431 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
###432 REYNOLDS WOLF, CNN CORRESPONDENT: This is not a complex issue. Daylight saving is basically
###436 self-explanatory, it`s saving daylight.
###441 Originally, daylight saving was one of those things where it was -- originally for agrarian
###448 societies, it was to use the -- get the most use out of as much daylight as you possibly
###453 could. It was certainly helpful with farmers, certainly helpful with fisherman. But then
###457 later, in later years it actually began -- daylight saving was actually practiced for the sole
###463 purpose of really saving energy.
###467 We`ve been following daylight saving time in the United States for quite a while. It
###473 really first became official back during World War I for the sake of growing extra food for
###477 troops overseas. It was brought back for World War II. But recently, it was the Energy Policy
###482 Act of 2005 that was the real difference maker that made it more of a formal type of exercise
###488 that has been basically followed by every state in the United States with a few exceptions
###492 that, being, of course, Arizona, Hawaii, U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico and the American
###498 Samoa.
###499 Internationally, it`s kind of a hodgepodge around the globe. If you took a look at the
###505 planet, and you were to light up places that were experiencing daylight saving, you`d see
###509 really just a hop, skip and a jump from one continent to the other. It`s kind of varied
###513 where you happen to go.
###514 There are some places, I can tell you in Africa where there are many spots they don`t practice
###518 it. There are many places, obviously, in parts of Asia. Europe, though, practices it for
###524 the most part.
###527 OK, now we are getting to the nitty-gritty stuff. This is the stuff that drives people
###530 crazy. To me, it`s daylight saving. It`s a verb, it`s something we are doing. We are
###536 saving daylight. Savings is a noun, that`s something that you have in the bank. Obviously,
###540 we are using the verb.
###543 It`s very possible that at some point we may indeed get rid of daylight saving time, but
###549 for the time being, it is certainly here, and something we got to deal with, for better
###553 or for worse.
###553 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###554 AZUZ: On Halloween, a 14-year old in Oregon elected to fight the bitterness of politics
###558 with a sweet political costume. He went out as a ballot box, the left side was for Obama,
###564 the right side for Romney. His neighbors voted by putting candy in the side they like more.
###569 And they could vote multiple times. So, no matter who got the most votes, this kid won.
###574 He said there was a five percent margin of error for any candy he ate while trick-or-treating,
###578 not to mention the fact that he wanted people to vote early and vote often, to totally stuff
###584 the ballot box. To sweeten the pot for their favorite candy dip.
###587 There is no real harm in it, though, when you think about it. The only potential corruption
###590 could have been to his teeth.
###592 We hope you answer the door when CNN STUDENT NEWS knocks again tomorrow. See you then.
