1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:3,384



2
0:0:3,384 --> 0:0:5,55
ALAN SEALES: This show is
very unique, and partially


3
0:0:5,55 --> 0:0:8,17
why I enjoy it so much is
because I feel like this


4
0:0:8,17 --> 0:0:12,52
is more musicians on stage
versus actors more or less.


5
0:0:12,52 --> 0:0:16,57
I mean, do you guys find
a distinction in that?


6
0:0:16,57 --> 0:0:18,12
ANDY TAYLOR: Somebody else talk.


7
0:0:18,12 --> 0:0:20,328
JOANNA CHRISTIE: It does
feel like playing in a band,


8
0:0:20,328 --> 0:0:21,27
for a lot of the show.


9
0:0:21,27 --> 0:0:26,3
But we're all pretty
much primarily actors,


10
0:0:26,3 --> 0:0:30,12
I think, really, that just
play instruments as well.


11
0:0:30,12 --> 0:0:31,68
So I don't know.


12
0:0:31,68 --> 0:0:32,94
There's no distinction.


13
0:0:32,94 --> 0:0:34,315
It's all blurred.


14
0:0:34,315 --> 0:0:36,19
We're doing what
the show requires,


15
0:0:36,19 --> 0:0:37,93
which is acting and
playing and singing.


16
0:0:37,93 --> 0:0:40,221
ARTHUR DARVILL: On my tax
return, I put actor/musician.


17
0:0:40,221 --> 0:0:42,24
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]


18
0:0:42,24 --> 0:0:44,417
JOANNA CHRISTIE: If that helps.


19
0:0:44,417 --> 0:0:47,0
ANDY TAYLOR: I have to say, I've
done a show-- if you're like,


20
0:0:47,0 --> 0:0:47,833
oh, it's so amazing.


21
0:0:47,833 --> 0:0:50,25
There are shows where the
actors play instruments.


22
0:0:50,25 --> 0:0:52,18
I was in one that
won all the words.


23
0:0:52,18 --> 0:0:54,33
And it was Sam Mendes
who did "American Beauty"


24
0:0:54,33 --> 0:0:55,38
and it was his "Cabaret."


25
0:0:55,38 --> 0:0:57,81
And they're reviving
it actually recently.


26
0:0:57,81 --> 0:1:2,31
But that was much more like
a couple of hot Kit Kat girls


27
0:1:2,31 --> 0:1:5,63
who quit playing
violin in fifth grade.


28
0:1:5,63 --> 0:1:7,39
And then they were
in the band later on.


29
0:1:7,39 --> 0:1:8,89
Whereas these guys
could all-- sure,


30
0:1:8,89 --> 0:1:11,24
we could all actually
play our instruments


31
0:1:11,24 --> 0:1:13,28
pretty much before
we got the gig.


32
0:1:13,28 --> 0:1:17,26
We've learned to play other
things more, but we're actors,


33
0:1:17,26 --> 0:1:20,16
but all of us have had
that 10-year immersion


34
0:1:20,16 --> 0:1:21,77
thing where we got
good at something.


35
0:1:21,77 --> 0:1:24,34
ALAN SEALES: So do you enjoy
playing your own instruments


36
0:1:24,34 --> 0:1:26,15
on stage more than
playing with a band.


37
0:1:26,15 --> 0:1:28,63
ARTHUR DARVILL: Yeah.


38
0:1:28,63 --> 0:1:32,55
I've never been in a band
that's this big before.


39
0:1:32,55 --> 0:1:34,64
I've always had a dream
of having a massive band.


40
0:1:34,64 --> 0:1:37,61
And suddenly, I've got it.


41
0:1:37,61 --> 0:1:38,22
It's great.


42
0:1:38,22 --> 0:1:41,7
And it keeps it fresh and alive.


43
0:1:41,7 --> 0:1:43,72
It's slightly
different every night,


44
0:1:43,72 --> 0:1:47,67
because someone's in a bad mood
or someone breaks a string.


45
0:1:47,67 --> 0:1:48,65
ALAN SEALES: Well,
what happens, then,


46
0:1:48,65 --> 0:1:49,774
if you guys break a string?


47
0:1:49,774 --> 0:1:52,627
Do you just say stop the
show, I gotta' restring.


48
0:1:52,627 --> 0:1:53,96
PAUL WITTY: Well, we do theater.


49
0:1:53,96 --> 0:1:54,57
We do theater.


50
0:1:54,57 --> 0:1:57,1
We're used to it.


51
0:1:57,1 --> 0:1:58,59
Stuff goes wrong every night.


52
0:1:58,59 --> 0:2:1,11
The audience never realizes
it, but stuff is always


53
0:2:1,11 --> 0:2:2,3
going wrong.


54
0:2:2,3 --> 0:2:3,53
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]


55
0:2:3,53 --> 0:2:5,33
PAUL WITTY: And like all the
little things that go wrong,


56
0:2:5,33 --> 0:2:6,704
we hear it, and
we see it, and we


57
0:2:6,704 --> 0:2:8,83
know kind of what's happening.


58
0:2:8,83 --> 0:2:11,17
But it's all about
improv-ing in that moment


59
0:2:11,17 --> 0:2:12,646
and staying with it.


60
0:2:12,646 --> 0:2:15,2
BROWN SHIRT BACK: And there's
contingency plans for that.


61
0:2:15,2 --> 0:2:17,71
Like, if Arthur breaks a string
during the very first song,


62
0:2:17,71 --> 0:2:19,251
there's somebody
else that's assigned


63
0:2:19,251 --> 0:2:22,2
to pick up that song, to pick
up the guitar on that song.


64
0:2:22,2 --> 0:2:23,8
I mean, there's a
whole list of who


65
0:2:23,8 --> 0:2:25,49
takes what when a string breaks.


66
0:2:25,49 --> 0:2:27,524
So for the sake
of the sound guys


67
0:2:27,524 --> 0:2:28,94
not going "who the
hell's playing?


68
0:2:28,94 --> 0:2:31,906
Oh God," we have an
actual contingency plan.


69
0:2:31,906 --> 0:2:33,875
ALAN SEALES: Right.


70
0:2:33,875 --> 0:2:35,5
How many of you guys
are original cast?


71
0:2:35,5 --> 0:2:36,35
Are any of you?


72
0:2:36,35 --> 0:2:37,266
BROWN SHIRT BACK: Yes.


73
0:2:37,266 --> 0:2:42,8
ALAN SEALES: So you
recorded the soundtrack not


74
0:2:42,8 --> 0:2:43,27
in isolation booths, right?


75
0:2:43,27 --> 0:2:46,57



76
0:2:46,57 --> 0:2:50,3
PAUL WITTY: Yeah, well, we
did it with Steve Epstein,


77
0:2:50,3 --> 0:2:51,7
was the producer of the album.


78
0:2:51,7 --> 0:2:55,35
And he had just done an album
with Yo-Yo Ma and Chris Seeley.


79
0:2:55,35 --> 0:2:58,79
He did the goat rodeo sessions.


80
0:2:58,79 --> 0:3:2,7
And the way they
recorded that album,


81
0:3:2,7 --> 0:3:5,4
it was like they did
it in like a farmhouse.


82
0:3:5,4 --> 0:3:6,98
And they all sat
in the same room


83
0:3:6,98 --> 0:3:9,94
and played together, rather than
each being in isolation booth,


84
0:3:9,94 --> 0:3:11,57
listening with headphones.


85
0:3:11,57 --> 0:3:15,559
So Martin, our music
director and Steve Epstein,


86
0:3:15,559 --> 0:3:17,1
kind of got together
and they decided


87
0:3:17,1 --> 0:3:19,67
that that's kind of what
they wanted to do with this.


88
0:3:19,67 --> 0:3:22,45
And make sure that it
felt like we were all


89
0:3:22,45 --> 0:3:24,83
playing together, rather
than playing to a track.


90
0:3:24,83 --> 0:3:28,38
And so hopefully, what
came off was a very kind


91
0:3:28,38 --> 0:3:31,66
of raw session
sounding-like thing.


92
0:3:31,66 --> 0:3:34,54
ALAN SEALES: Yeah, that was
another question I guess I had.


93
0:3:34,54 --> 0:3:35,54
I was thinking about it.


94
0:3:35,54 --> 0:3:37,9
The music is so raw.


95
0:3:37,9 --> 0:3:39,96
And I think it's written and
designed to sound like that


96
0:3:39,96 --> 0:3:41,78
and to come together
in that sort of thing.


97
0:3:41,78 --> 0:3:45,29
But it's well rehearsed and the
pre-show music, the pre-show


98
0:3:45,29 --> 0:3:47,43
that you guys do,
you have set songs.


99
0:3:47,43 --> 0:3:50,79
Do you do the same songs
in the pre-show every time?


100
0:3:50,79 --> 0:3:52,21
ANDY TAYLOR: Yeah, anybody else?


101
0:3:52,21 --> 0:3:54,51
ADAM WESLEY BROWN: Well,
we have a rotating list


102
0:3:54,51 --> 0:3:57,86
of about 20 or 30 Irish
and Czech folk songs.


103
0:3:57,86 --> 0:4:0,94
And part of the cool thing
about, like Arthur was saying,


104
0:4:0,94 --> 0:4:3,19
about being in a band is
that you come in every night,


105
0:4:3,19 --> 0:4:5,28
and right where you
sign in, they normally


106
0:4:5,28 --> 0:4:7,619
have a list of the songs
that are going up that night.


107
0:4:7,619 --> 0:4:9,16
So it's like you
come in and find out


108
0:4:9,16 --> 0:4:10,743
what the set list
is before you go out


109
0:4:10,743 --> 0:4:11,89
and get on with the band.


110
0:4:11,89 --> 0:4:13,64
DAVID PATRICK KELLEY:
And when we started,


111
0:4:13,64 --> 0:4:16,42
we were asked to bring in songs.


112
0:4:16,42 --> 0:4:20,16
And so we contributed a lot
of them, the things we had.


113
0:4:20,16 --> 0:4:23,259
And you know, the thing
that's great about


114
0:4:23,259 --> 0:4:25,55
is it gives-- you know,
there've been other shows where


115
0:4:25,55 --> 0:4:28,761
musicians have played, but
it gives you ownership.


116
0:4:28,761 --> 0:4:30,51
You really feel like
you're participating.


117
0:4:30,51 --> 0:4:32,22
I know you here at
Google know a lot


118
0:4:32,22 --> 0:4:34,24
about the strategy
of making people


119
0:4:34,24 --> 0:4:35,6
feel like they're participating.


120
0:4:35,6 --> 0:4:37,39
And that really helps us.


121
0:4:37,39 --> 0:4:38,42
We own the songs.


122
0:4:38,42 --> 0:4:41,68
We help express the other
characters' emotions as well as


123
0:4:41,68 --> 0:4:44,69
our own when we
step on to do it.


124
0:4:44,69 --> 0:4:49,55
But the songs, in particular,
in the beginning are meaningful.


125
0:4:49,55 --> 0:4:52,9
If you've brought them in,
and just by happenstance


126
0:4:52,9 --> 0:4:55,86
they wanted things that
weren't such Irish cliches,


127
0:4:55,86 --> 0:5:0,68
and it comes from John Tiffany,
our director, and from Glen


128
0:5:0,68 --> 0:5:4,319
Hansard, of course,
the pub culture, where


129
0:5:4,319 --> 0:5:6,61
people would get in the pub
and if you couldn't express


130
0:5:6,61 --> 0:5:8,85
your emotions through
words, you could sing it.


131
0:5:8,85 --> 0:5:12,191
And so that's the idea of that.


132
0:5:12,191 --> 0:5:14,44
ALAN SEALES: Oh, and we have
microphones in the aisles


133
0:5:14,44 --> 0:5:16,33
if you guys want to ask
questions from the audience.


134
0:5:16,33 --> 0:5:17,455
ARTHUR DARVILL: We'll sing.


135
0:5:17,455 --> 0:5:18,525
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]


136
0:5:18,525 --> 0:5:19,4
ALAN SEALES: Or sing.


137
0:5:19,4 --> 0:5:20,899
ANDY TAYLOR: (MOCK
DEEP VOICE) Well,


138
0:5:20,899 --> 0:5:23,71
the problem with that is--


139
0:5:23,71 --> 0:5:26,85
ALAN SEALES: The choreography,
as well, in the show


140
0:5:26,85 --> 0:5:27,99
is very, very unique.


141
0:5:27,99 --> 0:5:29,57
And I haven't seen
anything like it.


142
0:5:29,57 --> 0:5:31,4
And I quite enjoyed
the choreography,


143
0:5:31,4 --> 0:5:32,92
How did that come about?


144
0:5:32,92 --> 0:5:35,61
It was a lot of improv
to start, right?


145
0:5:35,61 --> 0:5:39,31
ANDY TAYLOR: Yes, Steven
Hoggett is our movement


146
0:5:39,31 --> 0:5:40,67
director/choreographer.


147
0:5:40,67 --> 0:5:43,512
And why are you guys laughing?


148
0:5:43,512 --> 0:5:46,28
Zygo, why don't you
answer it, Zygo?


149
0:5:46,28 --> 0:5:47,879
J. MICHAEL ZYGO:
Sure, in the process


150
0:5:47,879 --> 0:5:49,67
of creating the show--
I'm one of them all.


151
0:5:49,67 --> 0:5:53,1
I feel like I'm hiding
behind everybody-- people


152
0:5:53,1 --> 0:5:55,85
were asked to
contribute movements.


153
0:5:55,85 --> 0:5:58,64
And all of the movement
is based on the emotion.


154
0:5:58,64 --> 0:6:0,63
It's very rooted in the
motion of everything.


155
0:6:0,63 --> 0:6:3,87
And there's nothing like, you'll
see in "Newsies," where there's


156
0:6:3,87 --> 0:6:6,715
pas de bourree, turn,
turn, turn, kick, you know.


157
0:6:6,715 --> 0:6:8,9
ANDY TAYLOR: We're
not "Newsies."


158
0:6:8,9 --> 0:6:9,33
J. MICHAEL ZYGO:
We're not "Newsies."


159
0:6:9,33 --> 0:6:10,88
ANDY TAYLOR: Cause no one could.


160
0:6:10,88 --> 0:6:13,242
We would put it in
if we could do it.


161
0:6:13,242 --> 0:6:14,7
J. MICHAEL ZYGO:
But yeah, it's all


162
0:6:14,7 --> 0:6:18,62
meant to enhance and kind
of embellish upon the music.


163
0:6:18,62 --> 0:6:20,23
And so everything
is really cohesive


164
0:6:20,23 --> 0:6:22,459
and works together,
so that you never


165
0:6:22,459 --> 0:6:24,0
notice one thing
more than the other.


166
0:6:24,0 --> 0:6:28,259
And everything is just kind of
an accent to everything else.


167
0:6:28,259 --> 0:6:29,5
ANDY TAYLOR: Right.


168
0:6:29,5 --> 0:6:31,475
If I may, Hoggett
broke us up in Boston


169
0:6:31,475 --> 0:6:33,27
when we did this
workshop and not really


170
0:6:33,27 --> 0:6:35,228
knowing what was going
to happen with the show.


171
0:6:35,228 --> 0:6:39,327
Hoggett broke us up into
groups and said, you're bored,


172
0:6:39,327 --> 0:6:40,41
you're sitting at a table.


173
0:6:40,41 --> 0:6:43,436
And we can just come up with a
story of a couple of gestures


174
0:6:43,436 --> 0:6:44,81
that you could
teach one another.


175
0:6:44,81 --> 0:6:46,77
And so we would all do
it in our little groups.


176
0:6:46,77 --> 0:6:49,75
And those little pods of actors
came back and taught movement


177
0:6:49,75 --> 0:6:51,1
to everybody else.


178
0:6:51,1 --> 0:6:54,63
And I'd say 60% or
70% of certain songs


179
0:6:54,63 --> 0:6:58,2
are all extrapolated from
movement that people came in


180
0:6:58,2 --> 0:7:0,23
within that little session.


181
0:7:0,23 --> 0:7:1,982
And they were
like, you're bored.


182
0:7:1,982 --> 0:7:3,94
It wasn't specific, but
then in the bank scene,


183
0:7:3,94 --> 0:7:6,3
when they're trying to
get money from this sort


184
0:7:6,3 --> 0:7:8,98
of jaded old
banker, they awaken.


185
0:7:8,98 --> 0:7:11,92
Their little gestures that
they make that are very small,


186
0:7:11,92 --> 0:7:15,3
but they're very, very
powerful in capturing


187
0:7:15,3 --> 0:7:18,46
the emotional essence of
the scene or the music


188
0:7:18,46 --> 0:7:22,119
in a very simple gesture,
like a classic iconic move


189
0:7:22,119 --> 0:7:22,66
or something.


190
0:7:22,66 --> 0:7:24,22
And it's all from the actors.


191
0:7:24,22 --> 0:7:24,37
ALAN SEALES: Is it all set now?


192
0:7:24,37 --> 0:7:25,619
ANDY TAYLOR: It's all set now.


193
0:7:25,619 --> 0:7:30,12
But it was found
material from the actors.


194
0:7:30,12 --> 0:7:32,24
Steven Hoggett's has
got a company in the UK


195
0:7:32,24 --> 0:7:33,5
called Frantic Assembly.


196
0:7:33,5 --> 0:7:35,741
And I don't know, like
15 years or something.


197
0:7:35,741 --> 0:7:38,24
And it's really established and
really well known in the UK.


198
0:7:38,24 --> 0:7:41,56
And it's totally like
his signature, his style.


199
0:7:41,56 --> 0:7:44,1
If you see all their work
is really similar to this.


200
0:7:44,1 --> 0:7:45,65
It's all like what
Zygo was saying


201
0:7:45,65 --> 0:7:47,297
about from an emotional place.


202
0:7:47,297 --> 0:7:49,5
It's not just move
your arm here and then


203
0:7:49,5 --> 0:7:50,52
it's all right, gut rolling.


204
0:7:50,52 --> 0:7:52,21
It's amazing to watch.


205
0:7:52,21 --> 0:7:54,418
J. MICHAEL ZYGO: And then
one of the other challenges


206
0:7:54,418 --> 0:7:56,57
was creating choreography
that people could do well


207
0:7:56,57 --> 0:7:58,445
playing instruments,
like the end of Act One.


208
0:7:58,445 --> 0:8:0,342
That song we just played "Gold."


209
0:8:0,342 --> 0:8:2,675
Every one of us who was playing
that song and singing it


210
0:8:2,675 --> 0:8:5,3
is also dancing.


211
0:8:5,3 --> 0:8:7,29
And I remember the first day
I got into rehearsal down


212
0:8:7,29 --> 0:8:8,8
at the New York
Theater Workshop,


213
0:8:8,8 --> 0:8:10,8
I was the only new guy there.


214
0:8:10,8 --> 0:8:12,59
And they'd all already
established most of it.


215
0:8:12,59 --> 0:8:13,85
And the first thing we
did on the first day


216
0:8:13,85 --> 0:8:15,88
was started to learn the
choreography for "Gold."


217
0:8:15,88 --> 0:8:18,2
And I was already intimidated,
but then I looked over


218
0:8:18,2 --> 0:8:19,2
across the room,
and this guy's got


219
0:8:19,2 --> 0:8:20,48
a cello strapped to his chest.


220
0:8:20,48 --> 0:8:23,34
And I'm like is that guy
dancing with a cello?


221
0:8:23,34 --> 0:8:24,49
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]


222
0:8:24,49 --> 0:8:26,115
J. MICHAEL ZYGO: What
the hell is this?


223
0:8:26,115 --> 0:8:27,63
ANDY TAYLOR: Not well.


224
0:8:27,63 --> 0:8:31,58
I didn't have to do either
play, sing or dance particularly


225
0:8:31,58 --> 0:8:32,52
well, obviously.


226
0:8:32,52 --> 0:8:33,63
ALAN SEALES: You
have a cello harness.


227
0:8:33,63 --> 0:8:35,419
ANDY TAYLOR: Yeah, we
kind of invented it.


228
0:8:35,419 --> 0:8:36,45
PAUL WITTY: I want to
tell the story about when


229
0:8:36,45 --> 0:8:39,11
we were learning "Gold"
in Cambridge and all


230
0:8:39,11 --> 0:8:41,289
in fear of losing our jobs
because we couldn't dance


231
0:8:41,289 --> 0:8:44,37
and play instruments
at the same time,


232
0:8:44,37 --> 0:8:46,54
and Andy was
particularly freaking out


233
0:8:46,54 --> 0:8:47,47
because he was
like, well, I don't


234
0:8:47,47 --> 0:8:48,53
want to get cut
out of this number.


235
0:8:48,53 --> 0:8:49,75
He's like I got
a fricking cello.


236
0:8:49,75 --> 0:8:51,15
It's like what am I going to do.


237
0:8:51,15 --> 0:8:54,26
So he had a belt on, took
his belt off, wrapped it


238
0:8:54,26 --> 0:8:56,46
around his neck and he
tied it to the cello.


239
0:8:56,46 --> 0:8:58,1
And I was like that is baller.


240
0:8:58,1 --> 0:9:0,8
It was so good.


241
0:9:0,8 --> 0:9:2,57
And I was like, all right,
if he can figure out


242
0:9:2,57 --> 0:9:3,64
a way to dance with
his cello, I think


243
0:9:3,64 --> 0:9:5,598
I can figure out a way
to do it with my guitar.


244
0:9:5,598 --> 0:9:7,68
And it was inspiring
to see everyone


245
0:9:7,68 --> 0:9:10,2
sort of rising to the occasion.


246
0:9:10,2 --> 0:9:14,14
It was a lot of new demands and
we fueled each other that way.


247
0:9:14,14 --> 0:9:16,34
You'd see someone sort of
rising to it, and like OK.


248
0:9:16,34 --> 0:9:17,62
Yeah, I should do that too.


249
0:9:17,62 --> 0:9:18,29
ARTHUR DARVILL: It's
great the moment


250
0:9:18,29 --> 0:9:19,99
that you-- I'm looking
out towards the audience.


251
0:9:19,99 --> 0:9:20,78
You guys are all dancing.


252
0:9:20,78 --> 0:9:22,34
But as soon as
you start dancing,


253
0:9:22,34 --> 0:9:25,586
I see people just going, oh my
god, look [WHISPERING] doing.


254
0:9:25,586 --> 0:9:27,127
(AMERICAN ACCENT)
Oh, that's amazing.


255
0:9:27,127 --> 0:9:32,3



256
0:9:32,3 --> 0:9:34,39
ALAN SEALES: You're
saying, the choreography


257
0:9:34,39 --> 0:9:36,7
represents emotion,
and it represents


258
0:9:36,7 --> 0:9:38,2
the meaning behind
the songs, right?


259
0:9:38,2 --> 0:9:40,6
So I mean every night,
like show after show,


260
0:9:40,6 --> 0:9:41,34
you do eight shows a week.


261
0:9:41,34 --> 0:9:43,93
I mean, it's got to be
very emotionally taxing.


262
0:9:43,93 --> 0:9:46,9
Because this is about
anonymous guy and girl,


263
0:9:46,9 --> 0:9:49,13
but the whole
ensemble-- you guys


264
0:9:49,13 --> 0:9:53,69
are all very involved
and onstage constantly.


265
0:9:53,69 --> 0:9:57,24
ANDY TAYLOR: I think that's
an underrated tas-- I mean,


266
0:9:57,24 --> 0:10:1,4
it is trickier than it looks
to just night after night,


267
0:10:1,4 --> 0:10:3,584
just be sort of detached,
be an audience member.


268
0:10:3,584 --> 0:10:5,75
ADAM WESLEY BROWN: I will
say that I think all of us


269
0:10:5,75 --> 0:10:9,21
are big fans of not only
the story that is told,


270
0:10:9,21 --> 0:10:13,61
but the movie that was a hit,
that won the awards, and also


271
0:10:13,61 --> 0:10:15,1
Glen and Marketa's music.


272
0:10:15,1 --> 0:10:17,13
I know for a fact that
myself, when I first


273
0:10:17,13 --> 0:10:21,2
saw the movie years and years
ago, it struck me in such a way


274
0:10:21,2 --> 0:10:24,23
that I said if there's ever a
show or something like that,


275
0:10:24,23 --> 0:10:25,64
I got to be a part of it.


276
0:10:25,64 --> 0:10:27,88
But I think it
fuels us each night,


277
0:10:27,88 --> 0:10:30,91
like we were talking about
with the pre-shows set list,


278
0:10:30,91 --> 0:10:32,78
But as well with this
company of people,


279
0:10:32,78 --> 0:10:35,16
I mean, we all love
what we do so much


280
0:10:35,16 --> 0:10:39,723
and have so much damn fun doing
it that it really never-- I


281
0:10:39,723 --> 0:10:41,306
mean, sure, It gets
tiring because you


282
0:10:41,306 --> 0:10:42,17
do it eight show a week.


283
0:10:42,17 --> 0:10:44,45
And we hang out with
each other all the time.


284
0:10:44,45 --> 0:10:45,6
And we get on each
other's nerves.


285
0:10:45,6 --> 0:10:47,8
And it's like a family though.


286
0:10:47,8 --> 0:10:49,56
And it's really
lovely to go out.


287
0:10:49,56 --> 0:10:51,32
I think we're very
blessed in that we


288
0:10:51,32 --> 0:10:53,41
get to go out every
night and tell the story


289
0:10:53,41 --> 0:10:54,48
and sing these songs.


290
0:10:54,48 --> 0:10:56,72
And people are so
moved afterwards,


291
0:10:56,72 --> 0:10:58,22
that it kind of keep us going.


292
0:10:58,22 --> 0:11:1,3
I don't think there's
ever a time we go, oh, I


293
0:11:1,3 --> 0:11:3,552
don't want to go
into work today.


294
0:11:3,552 --> 0:11:5,135
ANDY TAYLOR: Except
today, apparently.


295
0:11:5,135 --> 0:11:10,12



296
0:11:10,12 --> 0:11:11,97
I mean, most of
the time, I agree


297
0:11:11,97 --> 0:11:14,54
we usually are really
eager to get to work.


298
0:11:14,54 --> 0:11:16,79
ADAM WESLEY BROWN: Laugh it
up, laugh it up, fuzzball.


299
0:11:16,79 --> 0:11:18,212
Laugh it up.


300
0:11:18,212 --> 0:11:21,59
ANDY TAYLOR: Sorry, he missed
out on the tour of lunch.


301
0:11:21,59 --> 0:11:22,299
So he missed out.


302
0:11:22,299 --> 0:11:24,256
ARTHUR DARVILL: I was
going to say the guys who


303
0:11:24,256 --> 0:11:26,15
started the original
cost of this,


304
0:11:26,15 --> 0:11:30,29
you've done over 600 shows.


305
0:11:30,29 --> 0:11:33,5
And it's like I've never
done that many shows a day.


306
0:11:33,5 --> 0:11:37,152
I've never done anything
that many times at all.


307
0:11:37,152 --> 0:11:39,36
DAVID PATRICK KELLY: Yeah,
it's a blessing, you know.


308
0:11:39,36 --> 0:11:44,71
As an actor, for 43 years you
can't-- when you're in a hit.


309
0:11:44,71 --> 0:11:46,104
It's so rare.


310
0:11:46,104 --> 0:11:48,27
And the thing about this
show is that so many things


311
0:11:48,27 --> 0:11:51,15
came together, like an
aligning of the stars.


312
0:11:51,15 --> 0:11:53,83
As Joanna said,
Steven Hoggett had


313
0:11:53,83 --> 0:11:55,252
this company Frantic Assembly.


314
0:11:55,252 --> 0:11:57,46
They did the same kind of
work with actors and tables


315
0:11:57,46 --> 0:12:0,97
and chairs for many
years, 20 years or so.


316
0:12:0,97 --> 0:12:3,999
But it wasn't until this, until
something really came together


317
0:12:3,999 --> 0:12:5,29
that was bigger than everybody.


318
0:12:5,29 --> 0:12:8,25
And they all have that
look on their faces


319
0:12:8,25 --> 0:12:11,44
where we've discovered
something that nobody quite owns


320
0:12:11,44 --> 0:12:13,7
but we all do beyond all of us.


321
0:12:13,7 --> 0:12:18,14
And Tiffany came when we
moved to Broadway, finally.


322
0:12:18,14 --> 0:12:20,8
We started in Cambridge
with 100 seats.


323
0:12:20,8 --> 0:12:21,15
And then when we were
moved to Broadway,


324
0:12:21,15 --> 0:12:23,7
he, almost tears in his
eyes, came up to us,


325
0:12:23,7 --> 0:12:24,84
and said we may close early.


326
0:12:24,84 --> 0:12:26,5
And it may not get very far.


327
0:12:26,5 --> 0:12:28,47
But we've come this far,
and it's really great.


328
0:12:28,47 --> 0:12:31,92
And nobody knew that we
would go on like that.


329
0:12:31,92 --> 0:12:33,55
ALAN SEALES: You
won Best Musical.


330
0:12:33,55 --> 0:12:34,7
DAVID PATRICK
KELLY: Say it again?


331
0:12:34,7 --> 0:12:34,98
ALAN SEALES: And then
you won Best Musical.


332
0:12:34,98 --> 0:12:36,646
DAVID PATRICK KELLY:
Yeah, best musical.


333
0:12:36,646 --> 0:12:39,65
But the idea of people
playing their own instruments


334
0:12:39,65 --> 0:12:44,92
and telling a story that since
Elvis, since the Beatles,


335
0:12:44,92 --> 0:12:48,23
on and on, blues folks
forever, the drama


336
0:12:48,23 --> 0:12:50,61
of holding your own instrument
and telling a story there


337
0:12:50,61 --> 0:12:51,56
is really intense.


338
0:12:51,56 --> 0:12:53,15
And we've known it
for a long time.


339
0:12:53,15 --> 0:12:55,5
And it has this global impact.


340
0:12:55,5 --> 0:12:56,69
I see people on the
line afterwards,


341
0:12:56,69 --> 0:12:59,16
when we're talking to folks,
from around the world.


342
0:12:59,16 --> 0:13:1,849
And some don't speak English.


343
0:13:1,849 --> 0:13:3,39
And they're still
moved, because they


344
0:13:3,39 --> 0:13:6,14
know the iconography
of this images


345
0:13:6,14 --> 0:13:8,58
there, all the
different characters.


346
0:13:8,58 --> 0:13:17,76
And so it's really the
thing that is beyond us all.


347
0:13:17,76 --> 0:13:19,1
ALAN SEALES: Oh yes, question.


348
0:13:19,1 --> 0:13:21,15
AUDIENCE: So, I apologize,
I haven't seen the show yet.


349
0:13:21,15 --> 0:13:21,78
Clearly, I have to go see it.


350
0:13:21,78 --> 0:13:22,822
MALE VOICE: Yes, you do.


351
0:13:22,822 --> 0:13:25,28
AUDIENCE: I notice it seems
like it's the kind of show that


352
0:13:25,28 --> 0:13:26,975
would be the kind
of thing you want


353
0:13:26,975 --> 0:13:29,35
to do in a 100-seat theater,
with like an intimate thing.


354
0:13:29,35 --> 0:13:30,5
What was it like
moving something


355
0:13:30,5 --> 0:13:32,18
like that, where you're
breaking the fourth wall so


356
0:13:32,18 --> 0:13:33,596
much, to Broadway
where you've got


357
0:13:33,596 --> 0:13:36,6
this-- all these people and
all this stuff going on.


358
0:13:36,6 --> 0:13:36,84
DAVID PATRICK KELLY:
Well, we were scared.


359
0:13:36,84 --> 0:13:39,3
We had to have workshops
when they had workshops


360
0:13:39,3 --> 0:13:41,91
with the vocal coach
to fill that theater,


361
0:13:41,91 --> 0:13:43,0
to try to bus it up.


362
0:13:43,0 --> 0:13:45,25
And once we're relaxed and
got into it, we understood.


363
0:13:45,25 --> 0:13:45,79
It was OK.


364
0:13:45,79 --> 0:13:47,15
It was a natural thing.


365
0:13:47,15 --> 0:13:49,52
That's amazing that it really
didn't change that much


366
0:13:49,52 --> 0:13:51,47
from 100 seats to
this big theater.


367
0:13:51,47 --> 0:13:53,1
It really did not
adjust that much.


368
0:13:53,1 --> 0:13:54,39
A few lines came and went.


369
0:13:54,39 --> 0:13:55,25
Things like that.


370
0:13:55,25 --> 0:13:58,655
But it just sort of
blossomed all along the way.


371
0:13:58,655 --> 0:14:0,4
And you just had to
adjust a little bit.


372
0:14:0,4 --> 0:14:2,108
PAUL WITTY: At New
York Theatre Workshop,


373
0:14:2,108 --> 0:14:3,43
it was a 200-seat house.


374
0:14:3,43 --> 0:14:4,98
You know, it was very intimate.


375
0:14:4,98 --> 0:14:6,6
And in Cambridge, even less.


376
0:14:6,6 --> 0:14:10,2
I think it was about 100
in that little place.


377
0:14:10,2 --> 0:14:13,23
And so, I mean, all of us were
quite worried about the move


378
0:14:13,23 --> 0:14:17,7
uptown and into an 1,100-seat
theater and what that was going


379
0:14:17,7 --> 0:14:20,16
to do to the delicacy and
the intimacy of the show.


380
0:14:20,16 --> 0:14:23,11
But I think, in fact, it
had the opposite effect


381
0:14:23,11 --> 0:14:24,53
that we felt it
was going to have.


382
0:14:24,53 --> 0:14:28,48
Rather than the show sort of
overwhelm New York Theater


383
0:14:28,48 --> 0:14:31,2
Workshop, it overwhelmed that
200-seat house, because there


384
0:14:31,2 --> 0:14:33,55
was so much sort of
happening on that stage,


385
0:14:33,55 --> 0:14:35,3
even thought it was a
very delicate story.


386
0:14:35,3 --> 0:14:38,13
And I think in the bigger space,
it feels much more delicate.


387
0:14:38,13 --> 0:14:40,667
It feels ooh, look at that
little thing up there.


388
0:14:40,667 --> 0:14:42,75
ALAN SEALES: I think there's
more energy to share.


389
0:14:42,75 --> 0:14:46,13
Because when I watch it, even
in like the sound check earlier,


390
0:14:46,13 --> 0:14:48,85
I was stressed out, herding
all you guys together,


391
0:14:48,85 --> 0:14:49,5
straggling in.


392
0:14:49,5 --> 0:14:51,958
And I sit and then all of a
sudden, you guys start playing.


393
0:14:51,958 --> 0:14:54,295
And I'm captivated by the
energy coming off the stage.


394
0:14:54,295 --> 0:14:55,6
ARTHUR DARVILL: The
nicest thing about the way


395
0:14:55,6 --> 0:14:56,729
the play works as well.


396
0:14:56,729 --> 0:14:58,27
I mean, you guys
haven't seen-- well,


397
0:14:58,27 --> 0:15:0,77
you watched it the other day.


398
0:15:0,77 --> 0:15:5,63
You haven't seen it, but I
watched before I was in it.


399
0:15:5,63 --> 0:15:8,56
And I was amazed by-- you
go to a Broadway show,


400
0:15:8,56 --> 0:15:9,75
and you're like, oh wow!


401
0:15:9,75 --> 0:15:12,15
It's very funny-- it's
very different to London.


402
0:15:12,15 --> 0:15:14,65
I walked in and the ushers were
like (CARNIVAL BARKER TONES)


403
0:15:14,65 --> 0:15:16,64
welcome to the
show of your life!


404
0:15:16,64 --> 0:15:17,78
And you're like oh wow.


405
0:15:17,78 --> 0:15:18,28
OK, great.


406
0:15:18,28 --> 0:15:21,65
We're going to have
a riot in here.


407
0:15:21,65 --> 0:15:25,21
And then you sit down, and this
very, very quiet show starts.


408
0:15:25,21 --> 0:15:27,84
And you're like is
meant to be humming?


409
0:15:27,84 --> 0:15:29,83
And then you're just
completely sold.


410
0:15:29,83 --> 0:15:31,55
It's mesmerizing.


411
0:15:31,55 --> 0:15:33,5
It's an amazing
thing to be part of.


412
0:15:33,5 --> 0:15:35,54
We kind of play
with that on stage,


413
0:15:35,54 --> 0:15:38,23
bring you down as far as
we can without people--


414
0:15:38,23 --> 0:15:39,19
but it's amazing.


415
0:15:39,19 --> 0:15:42,72
You see people just lean in--
you can hear a pin drop--


416
0:15:42,72 --> 0:15:43,22
and listen.


417
0:15:43,22 --> 0:15:46,53
And when it works-- there's
moments when it really works--


418
0:15:46,53 --> 0:15:49,875
it's amazing to be--- yeah.


419
0:15:49,875 --> 0:15:51,75
ALAN SEALES: We've got
time for one question,


420
0:15:51,75 --> 0:15:53,99
then we got to get out
of here unfortunately.


421
0:15:53,99 --> 0:15:56,63
AUDIENCE: This is a question
for Joanna and Arthur.


422
0:15:56,63 --> 0:15:58,66
Just wondering what
I was like coming in


423
0:15:58,66 --> 0:16:1,797
and being replacements
for the original cast.


424
0:16:1,797 --> 0:16:3,63
What it was like, if
you had the opportunity


425
0:16:3,63 --> 0:16:5,497
to reinvent the
characters yourself.


426
0:16:5,497 --> 0:16:7,33
I've seen the show a
couple different times,


427
0:16:7,33 --> 0:16:8,56
so I know it's a little
different with you


428
0:16:8,56 --> 0:16:10,68
guys as the leads,
and great, I may add.


429
0:16:10,68 --> 0:16:13,64
JOANNA CHRISTIE: We
had total freedom.


430
0:16:13,64 --> 0:16:14,58
We barely rehearsed.


431
0:16:14,58 --> 0:16:16,8
ARTHUR DARVILL: We
barely rehearsed.


432
0:16:16,8 --> 0:16:17,68
We just learned it and did it.


433
0:16:17,68 --> 0:16:21,625
JOANNA CHRISTIE: John Tiffany,
our director, was amazing.


434
0:16:21,625 --> 0:16:23,75
We learned and rehearsed
the music back in England,


435
0:16:23,75 --> 0:16:25,916
while we were waiting for
our visas to come through.


436
0:16:25,916 --> 0:16:28,5
And then we got two
days notice that we


437
0:16:28,5 --> 0:16:30,359
were coming, that we
were actually flying.


438
0:16:30,359 --> 0:16:31,9
So they called us
on Friday and said,


439
0:16:31,9 --> 0:16:33,31
we booked your
flights on Sunday.


440
0:16:33,31 --> 0:16:33,977
We were both OK.


441
0:16:33,977 --> 0:16:36,268
And then they're like, and
your first show's on Friday.


442
0:16:36,268 --> 0:16:37,25
We were like what?


443
0:16:37,25 --> 0:16:38,695
ARTHUR DARVILL: We had two
rehearsals, one [INAUDIBLE].


444
0:16:38,695 --> 0:16:39,76
JOANNA CHRISTIE: We had two
rehearsals with these guys,


445
0:16:39,76 --> 0:16:41,843
and then the dress rehearsal,
and then we were on.


446
0:16:41,843 --> 0:16:44,58



447
0:16:44,58 --> 0:16:46,8
John Tiffany's very
clever, I think,


448
0:16:46,8 --> 0:16:47,835
because actually we both
found that liberating,


449
0:16:47,835 --> 0:16:48,595
as opposed to scary.


450
0:16:48,595 --> 0:16:48,92
We found it freeing.


451
0:16:48,92 --> 0:16:51,64
ARTHUR DARVILL: That's also
like John's very, as a director


452
0:16:51,64 --> 0:16:53,52
that we had some-- hey.


453
0:16:53,52 --> 0:16:59,65



454
0:16:59,65 --> 0:17:8,215
As a director, John is amazing.


455
0:17:8,215 --> 0:17:10,589
I don't know if any of you've
seen "Glass Menagerie" yet.


456
0:17:10,589 --> 0:17:12,5
If you haven't, go and see it.


457
0:17:12,5 --> 0:17:14,88
It's the most amazing--
and it's the same team


458
0:17:14,88 --> 0:17:17,26
who put together this.


459
0:17:17,26 --> 0:17:18,865
And I said to John
after, so I said,


460
0:17:18,865 --> 0:17:21,73
how did you get those
guys to act so well?


461
0:17:21,73 --> 0:17:23,282
And he was just, I
just let them get


462
0:17:23,282 --> 0:17:28,329
on with it, which is him
doing himself down completely,


463
0:17:28,329 --> 0:17:30,56
because it's not
as easy as that.


464
0:17:30,56 --> 0:17:33,14
But he has this way of
just empowering actors


465
0:17:33,14 --> 0:17:35,81
to make you feel like
you can do anything


466
0:17:35,81 --> 0:17:37,6
and that you can be confident.


467
0:17:37,6 --> 0:17:39,268
JOANNA CHRISTIE: And also
he didn't try and replace--


468
0:17:39,268 --> 0:17:41,59
I mean, obviously we're both
so different from Cristin


469
0:17:41,59 --> 0:17:42,79
and Steve anyway.


470
0:17:42,79 --> 0:17:45,88
And I think he was clever
in not trying to just


471
0:17:45,88 --> 0:17:50,31
find reincarnations
of them as actors.


472
0:17:50,31 --> 0:17:52,48
He just started
from scratch almost,


473
0:17:52,48 --> 0:17:56,547
and just looked for the
relationship between the two


474
0:17:56,547 --> 0:17:58,88
characters, as opposed to
trying to find another Cristin


475
0:17:58,88 --> 0:18:0,38
and find another Steve
and see if it works,


476
0:18:0,38 --> 0:18:1,55
because it just wouldn't.


477
0:18:1,55 --> 0:18:5,6
And when we were
auditioning-- so


478
0:18:5,6 --> 0:18:7,45
we flew over here for
our last audition.


479
0:18:7,45 --> 0:18:10,974
And we saw the show, which could
have been a horrendous mistake,


480
0:18:10,974 --> 0:18:12,64
as I was watching
Cristin being amazing.


481
0:18:12,64 --> 0:18:15,58
And I was like, oh God, I've
got to try and do this tomorrow.


482
0:18:15,58 --> 0:18:17,6
But John came to me
before my audition


483
0:18:17,6 --> 0:18:20,47
and he said, just do
what you did in London.


484
0:18:20,47 --> 0:18:22,19
And so it gave me
the confidence to go,


485
0:18:22,19 --> 0:18:23,9
OK, I can't try and be Cristin.


486
0:18:23,9 --> 0:18:24,83
I can't do that.


487
0:18:24,83 --> 0:18:28,5
So I just have to have
faith in what I do.


488
0:18:28,5 --> 0:18:30,95
And so, yeah, we were
given a lot of freedom.


489
0:18:30,95 --> 0:18:31,95
And that was liberating.


490
0:18:31,95 --> 0:18:33,45
ARTHUR DARVILL: Yeah, the
material can be [INAUDIBLE].


491
0:18:33,45 --> 0:18:36,43
And the character's called Guy
and Girl, you know what I mean?


492
0:18:36,43 --> 0:18:38,81
I'm really excited about
coming back in 10 years


493
0:18:38,81 --> 0:18:40,62
time and watching
other people do it.


494
0:18:40,62 --> 0:18:45,56
And I think it's those kind of
part-- you'll still be there.


495
0:18:45,56 --> 0:18:47,242
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]


496
0:18:47,242 --> 0:18:49,325
ANDY TAYLOR: I'm the only
one with three children.


497
0:18:49,325 --> 0:18:53,7



498
0:18:53,7 --> 0:18:55,549
ALAN SEALES: Well,
we are at time.


499
0:18:55,549 --> 0:18:57,34
And unfortunately, we
have to wrap this up.


500
0:18:57,34 --> 0:19:0,55
But the show is currently
playing at the Jacobs Theater


501
0:19:0,55 --> 0:19:1,31
here in town.


502
0:19:1,31 --> 0:19:4,59
Go to OnceAMusical.com
to get your tickets.


503
0:19:4,59 --> 0:19:6,139
And everybody go please see it.


504
0:19:6,139 --> 0:19:6,68
It's amazing.


505
0:19:6,68 --> 0:19:8,16
The whole show was incredible.


506
0:19:8,16 --> 0:19:9,746
Thank you guys so much.


507
0:19:9,746 --> 0:21:9,746
AUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE]
