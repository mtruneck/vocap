3
0:0:15,56 --> 0:0:17,9
BRAD KREMER: He did good
for a long time.


4
0:0:17,9 --> 0:0:20,1
Because he started out--


5
0:0:20,1 --> 0:0:21,42
he was in skateboarding.


6
0:0:21,42 --> 0:0:24,65
Then he transitioned into
snowboarding in the very, very


7
0:0:24,65 --> 0:0:26,39
early days of snowboarding.


8
0:0:26,39 --> 0:0:30,11
And as snowboarding progressed,
he progressed.


9
0:0:30,11 --> 0:0:33,62
But then it got to a point to
where he wasn't this full


10
0:0:33,62 --> 0:0:34,41
freestyle guy.


11
0:0:34,41 --> 0:0:39,513
But because he was so good at
riding the mountain, he all of


12
0:0:39,513 --> 0:0:42,29
the sudden transitioned into
this big mountain guy, and was


13
0:0:42,29 --> 0:0:45,38
up in Alaska doing lines and
stuff that nobody ever


14
0:0:45,38 --> 0:0:46,745
expected him to do.


15
0:0:46,745 --> 0:0:48,16
He was amazing.


16
0:0:48,16 --> 0:0:52,27
It was really cool to see that
transition from just hard core


17
0:0:52,27 --> 0:0:55,49
freestyle guy to big mountain
guy, and to do both of them so


18
0:0:55,49 --> 0:0:58,32
well, better than
almost anybody.


19
0:0:58,32 --> 0:1:0,47
I would definitely say he's
one of the first to bring


20
0:1:0,47 --> 0:1:4,99
freestyle to the backcountry,
to the big mountain.


21
0:1:4,99 --> 0:1:5,63
MIKE HATCHETT: When I first met
Noah, he was definitely


22
0:1:5,63 --> 0:1:10,32
more focused on just freestyle,
and just riding


23
0:1:10,32 --> 0:1:11,74
Squaw, and just ripping
the pipe.


24
0:1:11,74 --> 0:1:13,51
But he started going out with
my brother and I in the


25
0:1:13,51 --> 0:1:15,71
backcountry and just kind of
dabbling around the steeps.


26
0:1:15,71 --> 0:1:17,53
He was a total natural talent.


27
0:1:17,53 --> 0:1:20,54
And then when we took him to
Alaska, that's almost when his


28
0:1:20,54 --> 0:1:22,71
mind just--


29
0:1:22,71 --> 0:1:27,66
I think he started just seeing
the possibilities


30
0:1:27,66 --> 0:1:30,19
of riding up there.


31
0:1:30,19 --> 0:1:32,54
That was the key that unlocked
the door for Noah.


32
0:1:32,54 --> 0:1:34,68
He's just amazing to watch
big mountain riding.


33
0:1:34,68 --> 0:1:38,31
And his ability on big
mountain riding


34
0:1:38,31 --> 0:1:41,11
is top 10 for sure.


35
0:1:41,11 --> 0:1:42,44
JP WALKER: He rode Tahoe
all the time.


36
0:1:42,44 --> 0:1:45,26
So it was just natural for him
to like ride those type of


37
0:1:45,26 --> 0:1:45,83
conditions.


38
0:1:45,83 --> 0:1:47,23
And he did it sick.


39
0:1:47,23 --> 0:1:50,26
Because it seemed like all the
other guys that were just big


40
0:1:50,26 --> 0:1:54,69
mountain riders kind of had a
weird style, or just not as


41
0:1:54,69 --> 0:2:0,17
smooth, like Matt Goodwill,
or Tex, or all those guys.


42
0:2:0,17 --> 0:2:4,19
They were sick for sure, but
then it was just cool to see


43
0:2:4,19 --> 0:2:5,28
somebody that could do both.


44
0:2:5,28 --> 0:2:8,25
I remember he did, like,
these one lines.


45
0:2:8,25 --> 0:2:10,389
I think they were called Super
Spines or something.


46
0:2:10,389 --> 0:2:12,795
He's, like, doing frontside
airs off them.


47
0:2:12,795 --> 0:2:14,24
And it's like the steepest
thing ever.


48
0:2:14,24 --> 0:2:16,14
Like if you fell, you'd
just be dead


49
0:2:16,14 --> 0:2:17,94
probably from rag dolling.


50
0:2:17,94 --> 0:2:20,59
MIKE HATCHETT: We did a
season TB2 at Donner.


51
0:2:20,59 --> 0:2:24,15
And that spring, let's
go to Alaska.


52
0:2:24,15 --> 0:2:26,68
OK, let's go.


53
0:2:26,68 --> 0:2:29,1
We just went up there and
started riding the stuff.


54
0:2:29,1 --> 0:2:31,62
We weren't really thinking
about it really.


55
0:2:31,62 --> 0:2:33,3
And Noah wasn't thinking
about it either.


56
0:2:33,3 --> 0:2:33,98
It wasn't, like, a goal.


57
0:2:33,98 --> 0:2:37,22
I want to charge Super
Spines one day.


58
0:2:37,22 --> 0:2:40,25
I had to basically almost talk
him into that run when he


59
0:2:40,25 --> 0:2:41,12
finally did do that.


60
0:2:41,12 --> 0:2:45,1
Because it was just so
ridiculously gnarly.


61
0:2:45,1 --> 0:2:46,28
But he was ready for it.


62
0:2:46,28 --> 0:2:47,68
And it was the perfect
day to do it.


63
0:2:47,68 --> 0:2:50,11
NOAH SALASNEK: Yeah, I would say
anything that's spined out


64
0:2:50,11 --> 0:2:53,36
is usually, the spines develop
anything over 55 degrees.


65
0:2:53,36 --> 0:2:56,6
So you're on something steep if
there's spines on it, and


66
0:2:56,6 --> 0:2:59,1
if it's powder and
good conditions.


67
0:2:59,1 --> 0:3:0,44
I mean, there's nothing
funner than that.


68
0:3:0,44 --> 0:3:1,72
It's a really amazing feeling.


69
0:3:1,72 --> 0:3:4,89
And the adrenaline you get
from it is just unreal.


70
0:3:4,89 --> 0:3:6,46
MIKE HATCHETT: Also being
goofy foot in


71
0:3:6,46 --> 0:3:7,93
Valdez on the spines.


72
0:3:7,93 --> 0:3:10,6
I know this is a little bit of
a sidebar that might be kind


73
0:3:10,6 --> 0:3:12,19
of a twist for people
to understand.


74
0:3:12,19 --> 0:3:15,79
A lot of the spines up there,
if you're goofy foot, you're


75
0:3:15,79 --> 0:3:16,77
toe edging them.


76
0:3:16,77 --> 0:3:20,92
And the way for the sluffs
run, and the way that the


77
0:3:20,92 --> 0:3:24,5
spines face, you're better off
being a goofy foot on a lot of


78
0:3:24,5 --> 0:3:25,77
the lines up there.


79
0:3:25,77 --> 0:3:28,63
Not to say on the big open
faces like what Johan was


80
0:3:28,63 --> 0:3:30,16
charging and Tom Burt.


81
0:3:30,16 --> 0:3:32,96
I'm just talking steep,
technical spines that are


82
0:3:32,96 --> 0:3:34,11
close together.


83
0:3:34,11 --> 0:3:37,1
When you send a sluff down a
run, you'll have to hop to the


84
0:3:37,1 --> 0:3:39,27
next one to send your
sluff down.


85
0:3:39,27 --> 0:3:40,38
Goofy foot--


86
0:3:40,38 --> 0:3:43,8
Jeremy Jones, Noah Salasnek--


87
0:3:43,8 --> 0:3:44,43
who rips the spines
the hardest?


88
0:3:44,43 --> 0:3:45,46
Those two guys.


89
0:3:45,46 --> 0:3:46,23
And they're goofy foots.


90
0:3:46,23 --> 0:3:48,66
And I think Valdez
and Haynes--


91
0:3:48,66 --> 0:3:50,16
maybe I'm crazy by
saying that.


92
0:3:50,16 --> 0:3:50,49
But I don't know.


93
0:3:50,49 --> 0:3:51,65
Ask Jeremy or Noah
what they think.


94
0:3:51,65 --> 0:3:53,42
But that's my opinion.


95
0:3:53,42 --> 0:3:55,98
NOAH SALASNEK: A lot of on
those spine runs, I would


96
0:3:55,98 --> 0:3:57,1
assess the line.


97
0:3:57,1 --> 0:3:59,81
I like to be able to ride
from left to right.


98
0:3:59,81 --> 0:4:1,63
Because you deal with
this sluff slides up


99
0:4:1,63 --> 0:4:2,33
there, they're called.


100
0:4:2,33 --> 0:4:3,95
And they're basically
mini avalanches.


101
0:4:3,95 --> 0:4:8,7
And they're made from your
turns, being on a steep slope.


102
0:4:8,7 --> 0:4:10,18
Throwing all that snow from
your turns creates these


103
0:4:10,18 --> 0:4:11,12
little avalanches.


104
0:4:11,12 --> 0:4:13,77
And when I saw, like, Super
Spines, for instance, it was


105
0:4:13,77 --> 0:4:14,67
kind of a big face.


106
0:4:14,67 --> 0:4:17,839
But I was able to go diagonal,
knowing all my snow would go


107
0:4:17,839 --> 0:4:20,16
below me and I wouldn't
encounter it again.


108
0:4:20,16 --> 0:4:21,54
So I didn't have to deal
with the sluff.


109
0:4:21,54 --> 0:4:23,47
And you can also jump from
one to the other.


110
0:4:23,47 --> 0:4:26,0
And I've always kind of prided
myself on bunnying from one


111
0:4:26,0 --> 0:4:28,935
spine to the next and kind of
staying on the power line and


112
0:4:28,935 --> 0:4:29,74
out of the channels.


113
0:4:29,74 --> 0:4:32,31
And maybe that's what Mike's
talking about appreciates my


114
0:4:32,31 --> 0:4:33,51
technique on the spines.


115
0:4:33,51 --> 0:4:36,7
Because that's kind of my
approach I guess a little bit.


116
0:4:36,7 --> 0:4:38,36
A lot of times we'll have to
take a Polaroid from the


117
0:4:38,36 --> 0:4:39,52
helicopter on the way up.


118
0:4:39,52 --> 0:4:40,71
Because we haven't been
to this mountain


119
0:4:40,71 --> 0:4:41,86
before or flown by it.


120
0:4:41,86 --> 0:4:43,52
So you get on top and
you can't see


121
0:4:43,52 --> 0:4:44,31
over the edge, really.


122
0:4:44,31 --> 0:4:47,6
Even if you walk down close
to the edge, it


123
0:4:47,6 --> 0:4:47,57
keeps rolling over.


124
0:4:47,57 --> 0:4:50,56
So you really rely on these
Polaroids that you take on the


125
0:4:50,56 --> 0:4:54,16
way up to know where you're at
and to find your line down.


126
0:4:54,16 --> 0:4:57,81
And it's really essential,
in Alaska especially.


127
0:4:57,81 --> 0:4:58,34
-That could be a go.


128
0:4:58,34 --> 0:4:59,56
That could be sick.


129
0:4:59,56 --> 0:5:0,15
-I'm starting here.


130
0:5:0,15 --> 0:5:2,83
[INTERPOSING VOICES]


131
0:5:2,83 --> 0:5:4,68
-The first one's a drop.


132
0:5:4,68 --> 0:5:6,53
Second one, you can
poke through.


133
0:5:6,53 --> 0:5:9,1
First one's a mandatory
little niblet.


134
0:5:9,1 --> 0:5:10,95
NOAH SALASNEK: Yeah, sometimes
I'll go to roll over.


135
0:5:10,95 --> 0:5:13,54
And what you think you might
be 30, 40 feet from your


136
0:5:13,54 --> 0:5:15,9
entrance is like 200 or
300 feet in Alaska.


137
0:5:15,9 --> 0:5:17,665
Because everything's so
much bigger up there.


138
0:5:17,665 --> 0:5:19,2
You're like, hey, I'm going
to do that cliff--


139
0:5:19,2 --> 0:5:20,25
30 footer.


140
0:5:20,25 --> 0:5:22,43
And you get next to it and
it's like 60 or 70.


141
0:5:22,43 --> 0:5:24,52
Everything's way bigger
than it looks up


142
0:5:24,52 --> 0:5:25,76
there for some reason.


143
0:5:25,76 --> 0:5:28,68
So it's really easy to get lost
on top of the ridge or


144
0:5:28,68 --> 0:5:30,12
not know where your
entrance is.


145
0:5:30,12 --> 0:5:32,88
And that could be a little
confusing until you get over


146
0:5:32,88 --> 0:5:35,43
and you say-- into that fluid
motion when you're


147
0:5:35,43 --> 0:5:36,35
involved in a line.


148
0:5:36,35 --> 0:5:38,87
But the entrance in the
top 100 feet or 200


149
0:5:38,87 --> 0:5:40,41
feet is just blinding.


150
0:5:40,41 --> 0:5:42,405
It keeps rolling and rolling
and rolling, especially if


151
0:5:42,405 --> 0:5:44,88
you're riding 55 degrees plus.


152
0:5:44,88 --> 0:5:45,92
So it's pretty burly.


153
0:5:45,92 --> 0:5:48,7
And that's the scariest thing,
is being on top, out of your


154
0:5:48,7 --> 0:5:51,55
board before you ride down.


155
0:5:51,55 --> 0:5:52,54
You don't have that edge.


156
0:5:52,54 --> 0:5:54,69
But once I get on my board,
I feel comfortable.


157
0:5:54,69 --> 0:5:57,89
I have my edge, dig in, and just
wait for the cameras to


158
0:5:57,89 --> 0:5:59,6
say "roll," and then get it.


159
0:5:59,6 --> 0:6:0,324
And it's pretty fun, actually.


160
0:6:0,324 --> 0:6:22,23



161
0:6:22,23 --> 0:6:25,13
JAMIE LYNN: My first trip up
to Alaska was with Noah.


162
0:6:25,13 --> 0:6:29,6
And I look back at that as, I'm
so thankful I had someone


163
0:6:29,6 --> 0:6:33,93
as knowledgeable and as
professional and as on it as


164
0:6:33,93 --> 0:6:39,75
he was to show me an
introduction to one of the


165
0:6:39,75 --> 0:6:42,94
biggest arenas of
snowboarding.


166
0:6:42,94 --> 0:6:45,3
Especially with Mike
and Dave Hatchett--


167
0:6:45,3 --> 0:6:49,226
they are the ultimate
mountaineering guides, that


168
0:6:49,226 --> 0:6:51,25
can not only drop into
the craziest


169
0:6:51,25 --> 0:6:54,14
terrain, but allow you--


170
0:6:54,14 --> 0:6:57,13
if something went down, be there
for you and be able to


171
0:6:57,13 --> 0:7:3,7
assist in any kind of situation
that could come up.


172
0:7:3,7 --> 0:7:5,97
It's a tense situation being
up there-- a lot of first


173
0:7:5,97 --> 0:7:9,8
ascents, a lot of unstable
snow conditions.


174
0:7:9,8 --> 0:7:12,13
And the knowledge and
understanding of the mountains


175
0:7:12,13 --> 0:7:16,82
that Noah, in particular,
showcased made me sit a little


176
0:7:16,82 --> 0:7:20,99
bit easier in dropping into a
55 degree slope where you


177
0:7:20,99 --> 0:7:24,11
couldn't even see what you were
dropping into, only by


178
0:7:24,11 --> 0:7:26,18
looking at the Polaroid picture
that you took from the


179
0:7:26,18 --> 0:7:29,59
helicopter on the way up.


180
0:7:29,59 --> 0:7:33,77
We shared a couple first
ascents up in AK that--


181
0:7:33,77 --> 0:7:38,1
runs of a lifetime that
I'll never forget.


182
0:7:38,1 --> 0:7:39,73
NOAH SALASNEK: I was in Alaska
with Jamie one year.


183
0:7:39,73 --> 0:7:42,21
We had a really good trip and
did some incredible lines


184
0:7:42,21 --> 0:7:42,86
together, too.


185
0:7:42,86 --> 0:7:44,0
One of my first ascents--


186
0:7:44,0 --> 0:7:45,19
Blind Faith.


187
0:7:45,19 --> 0:7:46,65
I was with Jamie Lynn.


188
0:7:46,65 --> 0:7:48,21
That was one of my more
notable runs.


189
0:7:48,21 --> 0:7:51,71
And he was pretty stoked and
terrified at the same time, as


190
0:7:51,71 --> 0:7:52,27
was I.


191
0:7:52,27 --> 0:7:55,5
But we got out on this thing and
the guide didn't get out.


192
0:7:55,5 --> 0:7:56,87
The guide got in the
heli and flew away.


193
0:7:56,87 --> 0:7:57,76
We couldn't believe it.


194
0:7:57,76 --> 0:7:59,99
We're like, isn't the guide
supposed to get out with us?


195
0:7:59,99 --> 0:8:2,85
And we're on this thing
together, on a cornice of all


196
0:8:2,85 --> 0:8:4,6
thing entrance line.


197
0:8:4,6 --> 0:8:5,75
But anyway, it was a
pretty sick run.


198
0:8:5,75 --> 0:8:7,93
And he was there for that.


199
0:8:7,93 --> 0:8:8,795
It was cool.


200
0:8:8,795 --> 0:8:10,31
I enjoyed riding powder.


201
0:8:10,31 --> 0:8:13,22
I never thought that would have
been most of my focus and


202
0:8:13,22 --> 0:8:16,33
my career later on, which
it absolutely was.


203
0:8:16,33 --> 0:8:17,65
Not that I had tried
to do that.


204
0:8:17,65 --> 0:8:18,92
It just kind of developed
that way.


205
0:8:18,92 --> 0:8:20,75
I had an opportunity
to go to Alaska.


206
0:8:20,75 --> 0:8:22,17
That was amazing.


207
0:8:22,17 --> 0:8:23,49
So I went back every year.


208
0:8:23,49 --> 0:8:26,1
And it's super enjoyable
as a rider.


209
0:8:26,1 --> 0:8:27,29
It's the best thing to film.


210
0:8:27,29 --> 0:8:28,69
Because they're like,
go ahead.


211
0:8:28,69 --> 0:8:29,41
Ride the mountain.


212
0:8:29,41 --> 0:8:30,175
We'll film you from the heli.


213
0:8:30,175 --> 0:8:31,93
So you just ride the
whole thing.


214
0:8:31,93 --> 0:8:34,179
And the footage that comes out
of there isn't going to be


215
0:8:34,179 --> 0:8:35,6
freestyle-based.


216
0:8:35,6 --> 0:8:36,83
It's going to be some powder.


217
0:8:36,83 --> 0:8:38,34
But yeah, professionally,
I think


218
0:8:38,34 --> 0:8:39,549
freestyle's where it's at.


219
0:8:39,549 --> 0:8:41,36
It's always been the
progression.


220
0:8:41,36 --> 0:8:43,59
It should be the focus, and
it is in most sports.


221
0:8:43,59 --> 0:8:44,62
And it is in snowboarding.


222
0:8:44,62 --> 0:8:46,5
So I think that--


223
0:8:46,5 --> 0:8:48,23
I don't know if it was a
career mistake of mine.


224
0:8:48,23 --> 0:8:51,26
But I don't think it certainly
helped to focus strictly on


225
0:8:51,26 --> 0:8:53,464
powder as much as I did, and
big mountain riding.


226
0:8:53,464 --> 0:8:56,18
I should have done a little
bit more of both, and, of


227
0:8:56,18 --> 0:8:58,15
course, stayed in freestyle
for longer.


228
0:8:58,15 --> 0:9:1,21
I think I would have had a
longer career had I done that,


229
0:9:1,21 --> 0:9:2,17
potentially.


230
0:9:2,17 --> 0:9:3,77
So it's interesting to say.


231
0:9:3,77 --> 0:9:5,98
Because big mountain riding's
pretty gnarly, putting your


232
0:9:5,98 --> 0:9:8,27
life on the line for
first ascents.


233
0:9:8,27 --> 0:9:9,84
But a lot of people don't
ride that kind of


234
0:9:9,84 --> 0:9:10,98
stuff and can't relate.


235
0:9:10,98 --> 0:9:12,86
They can relate to the
parks and the pipes.


236
0:9:12,86 --> 0:9:13,98
And that's the stuff
they want to see.


237
0:9:13,98 --> 0:9:15,9
And I understand that.


238
0:9:15,9 --> 0:9:18,43
And so it's unfortunately
not as marketable.


239
0:9:18,43 --> 0:9:19,6
That's how it is.


240
0:9:19,6 --> 0:9:21,14
JP WALKER: I mean, I didn't
really see it like that.


241
0:9:21,14 --> 0:9:25,62
I just kind of figured he just
got sick of doing it.


242
0:9:25,62 --> 0:9:30,43
Because back then it seemed like
the average time spent


243
0:9:30,43 --> 0:9:32,76
for a top pro was--


244
0:9:32,76 --> 0:9:35,86
like if you had like five video
parts, you had a lot of


245
0:9:35,86 --> 0:9:37,83
video parts under your belt.


246
0:9:37,83 --> 0:9:40,6
So he'd already had, like,
a bunch of parts.


247
0:9:40,6 --> 0:9:43,775
And I just figured he was on to
other things or something.


248
0:9:43,775 --> 0:9:46,58
NOAH SALASNEK: You know, I never
aspire to say or set


249
0:9:46,58 --> 0:9:48,89
goals for myself, like most
people probably do


250
0:9:48,89 --> 0:9:49,91
and should, I believe.


251
0:9:49,91 --> 0:9:53,1
But I really was just motivated
and hungry to ride


252
0:9:53,1 --> 0:9:53,61
and to film.


253
0:9:53,61 --> 0:9:55,48
I wanted to put out these
videos every year.


254
0:9:55,48 --> 0:9:56,59
And they were selling well.


255
0:9:56,59 --> 0:9:58,69
And the boards are
selling well.


256
0:9:58,69 --> 0:10:1,3
And I was just really motivated
to snowboard.


257
0:10:1,3 --> 0:10:1,97
I like snowboarding.


258
0:10:1,97 --> 0:10:4,48
But I would focus on a part
every year and try


259
0:10:4,48 --> 0:10:6,5
to make a good part.


260
0:10:6,5 --> 0:10:8,93
And be aware of what I've shot
so far this season and


261
0:10:8,93 --> 0:10:10,99
try to mix it up.


262
0:10:10,99 --> 0:10:12,67
And then cap it with Alaska
at the end of


263
0:10:12,67 --> 0:10:13,87
year, was always nice.


264
0:10:13,87 --> 0:10:17,47
But definitely made filming a
priority and tried to put out


265
0:10:17,47 --> 0:10:19,9
the best part I could
every year.


266
0:10:19,9 --> 0:10:20,49
It's always hard.


267
0:10:20,49 --> 0:10:22,97
Everyone wants to one up you
every year, or put out a


268
0:10:22,97 --> 0:10:23,93
better part every year.


269
0:10:23,93 --> 0:10:24,87
And that can be tough.


270
0:10:24,87 --> 0:10:28,42
Unfortunately, as I became more
popular, I could say,


271
0:10:28,42 --> 0:10:31,45
worldwide, travel becomes a
little bit of an issue.


272
0:10:31,45 --> 0:10:32,88
I'm not great with travel.


273
0:10:32,88 --> 0:10:36,94
A lot of times it's not all
glory in snowboarding.


274
0:10:36,94 --> 0:10:40,7
I'd go to Japan without my board
and do five or six shop


275
0:10:40,7 --> 0:10:42,52
tours in a week.


276
0:10:42,52 --> 0:10:44,13
Sometimes it can be a burden.


277
0:10:44,13 --> 0:10:45,41
I wasn't cut out for that.


278
0:10:45,41 --> 0:10:47,72
A lot of people are like,
I want to be sponsored.


279
0:10:47,72 --> 0:10:48,45
I want to be pro.


280
0:10:48,45 --> 0:10:49,12
I'm good enough.


281
0:10:49,12 --> 0:10:52,22
Well how professional are you?


282
0:10:52,22 --> 0:10:54,81
It's a lot of marketing involved
and you've got to


283
0:10:54,81 --> 0:10:57,34
present yourself properly and do
a lot of stuff you may not


284
0:10:57,34 --> 0:10:57,86
want to do.


285
0:10:57,86 --> 0:11:0,4
That became old, I think,
year after year.


286
0:11:0,4 --> 0:11:1,265
I just wanted to snowboard.


287
0:11:1,265 --> 0:11:2,565
Because that's who I was--
a snowboarder.


288
0:11:2,565 --> 0:11:4,595
I wanted to ride powder
and go to Alaska.


289
0:11:4,595 --> 0:11:7,29
And I was able to do that, but
you just want to snowboard.


290
0:11:7,29 --> 0:11:8,15
And you're like, I rip.


291
0:11:8,15 --> 0:11:9,5
I'm in a video.


292
0:11:9,5 --> 0:11:10,3
I deserve this.


293
0:11:10,3 --> 0:11:12,69
And you think you're
everything.


294
0:11:12,69 --> 0:11:14,16
And sure, it's a lot of it.


295
0:11:14,16 --> 0:11:16,24
But there's a lot more that
comes with it that you don't


296
0:11:16,24 --> 0:11:18,49
realize when you're young.


297
0:11:18,49 --> 0:11:23,175
--is the start of the beginning
of the end.


298
0:11:23,175 --> 0:11:25,65
Woo.


299
0:11:25,65 --> 0:11:25,9
Thanks.


300
0:11:25,9 --> 0:11:27,358
-Hello.


301
0:11:27,358 --> 0:11:28,608
Hello.


302
0:11:28,608 --> 0:11:31,246



303
0:11:31,246 --> 0:11:32,704
NOAH SALASNEK: Get that thing
off me right now.


304
0:11:32,704 --> 0:11:37,67



305
0:11:37,67 --> 0:11:41,584
-It's been a long day,
a long month.


306
0:11:41,584 --> 0:11:43,88
NOAH SALASNEK: A long couple
of years, to be honest.


307
0:11:43,88 --> 0:11:45,134
-Just a year.


308
0:11:45,134 --> 0:11:47,11
NOAH SALASNEK: Longer.


309
0:11:47,11 --> 0:11:49,184
-How long?


310
0:11:49,184 --> 0:11:51,594
NOAH SALASNEK: 14.


311
0:11:51,594 --> 0:11:52,558
Just kidding.


312
0:11:52,558 --> 0:11:54,4
That thing's not on, right?


313
0:11:54,4 --> 0:11:59,788



314
0:11:59,788 --> 0:12:1,17
-God, I look like shit.


315
0:12:1,17 --> 0:12:4,71
NOAH SALASNEK: Yeah, my last
few years with Sims, my


316
0:12:4,71 --> 0:12:5,77
contract was up.


317
0:12:5,77 --> 0:12:9,3
And I had wanted to break away
from Sims and start this


318
0:12:9,3 --> 0:12:12,85
company with Mack Dawg and
Peter Line called Forum.


319
0:12:12,85 --> 0:12:14,18
And I was into it.


320
0:12:14,18 --> 0:12:16,92
And I went to Sims and said,
I don't want to re-sign.


321
0:12:16,92 --> 0:12:19,44
And they said hey, we
have obligations.


322
0:12:19,44 --> 0:12:21,44
We got you for two more
years if we want you.


323
0:12:21,44 --> 0:12:25,3
Line 36 c clearly states--


324
0:12:25,3 --> 0:12:26,31
I didn't fight them on it.


325
0:12:26,31 --> 0:12:29,1
I signed up again and balked
on the Forum thing,


326
0:12:29,1 --> 0:12:29,99
unfortunately.


327
0:12:29,99 --> 0:12:32,92
And two years later--


328
0:12:32,92 --> 0:12:34,7
I don't know-- they changed
hands again.


329
0:12:34,7 --> 0:12:37,38
Sims had a lot of different
CEOs, a lot of different


330
0:12:37,38 --> 0:12:39,4
manufacturers over the years.


331
0:12:39,4 --> 0:12:43,45
And unfortunately, they didn't
re-sign me after two years.


332
0:12:43,45 --> 0:12:44,44
They kind of left me hanging.


333
0:12:44,44 --> 0:12:46,81
I was like, whoa, I wanted to
break away and do my thing.


334
0:12:46,81 --> 0:12:48,71
Now you're leaving me hanging.


335
0:12:48,71 --> 0:12:50,95
And it was a little late for me
to get in on Forum at that


336
0:12:50,95 --> 0:12:52,3
point, obviously.


337
0:12:52,3 --> 0:12:55,3
So that was really unfortunate
how that played out.


338
0:12:55,3 --> 0:12:57,15
And I really felt let down.


339
0:12:57,15 --> 0:12:59,75
Man, I had done so much for
them over the years, and


340
0:12:59,75 --> 0:13:2,4
kicked me to the curb in late
summer without a contract and


341
0:13:2,4 --> 0:13:2,94
no warning.


342
0:13:2,94 --> 0:13:4,1
It's just kind of crazy.


343
0:13:4,1 --> 0:13:6,4
Some 17-year-old
team manager--


344
0:13:6,4 --> 0:13:7,18
doesn't seem right.


345
0:13:7,18 --> 0:13:8,63
So I was always a little
jaded on that.


346
0:13:8,63 --> 0:13:11,8
I would've appreciated a call
from anybody in the office,


347
0:13:11,8 --> 0:13:15,21
maybe even Tom would have been
cool. "Hey dude, we're not


348
0:13:15,21 --> 0:13:16,17
going to make a board.


349
0:13:16,17 --> 0:13:17,56
Sorry." But no.


350
0:13:17,56 --> 0:13:19,25
They had some kid come out and
tell me they're not going to


351
0:13:19,25 --> 0:13:20,85
re-sign me.


352
0:13:20,85 --> 0:13:22,43
After I begged them to not ride
for them to go to this


353
0:13:22,43 --> 0:13:23,13
other company.


354
0:13:23,13 --> 0:13:26,17
So they really, I think, took
advantage a little bit.


355
0:13:26,17 --> 0:13:29,12
And unfortunately for me, it
didn't pan out that well


356
0:13:29,12 --> 0:13:30,28
afterwards for me.


357
0:13:30,28 --> 0:13:32,63
I would've loved to have
been a part of Forum.


358
0:13:32,63 --> 0:13:35,48
JP WALKER: I think probably he
was being talked to just


359
0:13:35,48 --> 0:13:38,12
because he was such good
friends with Mack Dawg.


360
0:13:38,12 --> 0:13:42,93
And I think I do remember him
talking about that actually.


361
0:13:42,93 --> 0:13:46,43
But like I said, around that
time-- because I think Forum


362
0:13:46,43 --> 0:13:50,48
started, like '96 or '7 as well,
so that was kind of that


363
0:13:50,48 --> 0:13:53,16
same time frame where he was
kind of just trying to fade--


364
0:13:53,16 --> 0:13:57,25
or starting to fade out of
the scene a little bit.


365
0:13:57,25 --> 0:13:58,82
NOAH SALASNEK: Now looking back
on it, I don't know that


366
0:13:58,82 --> 0:14:2,29
I would have been a perfect
piece of that puzzle, because


367
0:14:2,29 --> 0:14:4,2
they were so
freestyle-oriented--


368
0:14:4,2 --> 0:14:6,6
hand rails, and just
kickers, and--


369
0:14:6,6 --> 0:14:7,92
I don't know that they knew
that then either.


370
0:14:7,92 --> 0:14:9,3
They just had this idea.


371
0:14:9,3 --> 0:14:10,1
And they wanted me in.


372
0:14:10,1 --> 0:14:11,35
It was a good crew so far.


373
0:14:11,35 --> 0:14:12,32
I wanted in.


374
0:14:12,32 --> 0:14:13,82
JP WALKER: Back then when
it started there


375
0:14:13,82 --> 0:14:16,84
wasn't that many people.


376
0:14:16,84 --> 0:14:19,6
He was one of the best
freestyle or


377
0:14:19,6 --> 0:14:19,98
jibber dudes, you know?


378
0:14:19,98 --> 0:14:23,3
He wasn't doing , like, crazy
rails and stuff like that.


379
0:14:23,3 --> 0:14:26,98
But he was definitely bonking
and had like that skate style.


380
0:14:26,98 --> 0:14:29,82
And I know he was friends with
Peter Line and stuff.


381
0:14:29,82 --> 0:14:32,4
And then there was only
me, Bjorn, and Chris


382
0:14:32,4 --> 0:14:33,18
Dufficy from there.


383
0:14:33,18 --> 0:14:37,14
So it was like, him and Peter
could've easily spearheaded


384
0:14:37,14 --> 0:14:38,31
that whole thing together.


385
0:14:38,31 --> 0:14:41,53
And who knows which direction
it would've went.


386
0:14:41,53 --> 0:14:42,78
I would have been stoked.


387
0:14:42,78 --> 0:14:45,55



388
0:14:45,55 --> 0:14:47,25
NOAH SALASNEK: Sims-- when I was
growing up snowboarding,


389
0:14:47,25 --> 0:14:49,2
it was like Sims
was the board.


390
0:14:49,2 --> 0:14:51,42
Everyone rode Sims.


391
0:14:51,42 --> 0:14:53,96
They were the best boards,
probably, back then.


392
0:14:53,96 --> 0:14:57,74
It was incredible to think
that I would ride


393
0:14:57,74 --> 0:14:58,27
for them one day.


394
0:14:58,27 --> 0:15:0,31
And when I did, I think
it was such a large


395
0:15:0,31 --> 0:15:1,99
entity in my mind.


396
0:15:1,99 --> 0:15:5,38
The Sims name is just a huge
name in snowboarding.


397
0:15:5,38 --> 0:15:6,71
I was stoked to ride for them.


398
0:15:6,71 --> 0:15:9,97
And I still am to say that
I rode for them.


399
0:15:9,97 --> 0:15:11,38
It just didn't go
well at the end.


400
0:15:11,38 --> 0:15:14,5
And everything works out for a
reason, I feel like, in life.


401
0:15:14,5 --> 0:15:15,64
And I can't complain.


402
0:15:15,64 --> 0:15:17,4
Should'ves and would'ves
will kill you.


403
0:15:17,4 --> 0:15:18,54
And I can sit here all
day and say that.


404
0:15:18,54 --> 0:15:20,3
But again, I have no regrets.


405
0:15:20,3 --> 0:15:23,86
And I've had good experiences
and a great life in


406
0:15:23,86 --> 0:15:25,79
snowboarding for sure.


407
0:15:25,79 --> 0:15:27,87
JAMIE LYNN: I don't think that
opportunity's gone for


408
0:15:27,87 --> 0:15:29,52
someone like Noah.


409
0:15:29,52 --> 0:15:32,37
I really still feel that there's
a lot of people out


410
0:15:32,37 --> 0:15:36,49
there that he's touched in a way
that has made a difference


411
0:15:36,49 --> 0:15:37,5
in their life.


412
0:15:37,5 --> 0:15:38,48
NOAH SALASNEK: I guess
what I've done for


413
0:15:38,48 --> 0:15:40,2
Billabong and Sims--


414
0:15:40,2 --> 0:15:43,3
Billabong, I rode for them,
being the only rider for four


415
0:15:43,3 --> 0:15:43,69
or five years.


416
0:15:43,69 --> 0:15:46,3
I felt I helped develop
a whole brand there.


417
0:15:46,3 --> 0:15:48,13
And with Sims, I felt I brought
them around with


418
0:15:48,13 --> 0:15:50,6
Palmer, brought them
kind of back.


419
0:15:50,6 --> 0:15:51,95
And yeah, I don't know.


420
0:15:51,95 --> 0:15:54,29
A lot of it's my first ascents
and the actual riding that


421
0:15:54,29 --> 0:15:56,11
I've done that I'm really
stoked and proud of.


422
0:15:56,11 --> 0:15:58,29
Not necessarily in my
accomplishments and my


423
0:15:58,29 --> 0:16:0,68
professional part, but
the riding itself.


424
0:16:0,68 --> 0:16:3,56
And the lines that I've done in
Super Spines, and all these


425
0:16:3,56 --> 0:16:5,0
just hairball things--


426
0:16:5,0 --> 0:16:6,28
risked my life.


427
0:16:6,28 --> 0:16:8,25
I'll never forget them.


428
0:16:8,25 --> 0:16:10,9
It was like yesterday I
remember these things.


429
0:16:10,9 --> 0:16:11,47
And it's sick, because
I have that.


430
0:16:11,47 --> 0:16:13,52
And I'll always have that.


431
0:16:13,52 --> 0:16:14,45
And that's pretty sweet.


432
0:16:14,45 --> 0:16:15,95
And that's the best thing I'll
take with me from my


433
0:16:15,95 --> 0:16:18,23
snowboarding is all these
experiences and what I've got


434
0:16:18,23 --> 0:16:20,2
to do over the years.


435
0:16:20,2 --> 0:16:22,6
And it's a blessing that
companies like Billabong and


436
0:16:22,6 --> 0:16:24,65
DC and Dragon, and
people that have


437
0:16:24,65 --> 0:16:26,5
promoted me over the years.


438
0:16:26,5 --> 0:16:27,84
I really appreciate them too.


439
0:16:27,84 --> 0:16:29,456
Because I couldn't have
done it without them.


440
0:16:29,456 --> 0:16:41,18
[RUSTLING AND BREATHING]


441
0:16:41,18 --> 0:16:50,79
NOAH SALASNEK: OK, I'm ready
for 10 seconds You


442
0:16:50,79 --> 0:16:53,101
can count me in.


443
0:16:53,101 --> 0:17:43,4



444
0:17:43,4 --> 0:17:45,23
NOAH SALASNEK: Tell them it's
kind of sticky pile in the


445
0:17:45,23 --> 0:17:48,34
fucking sunlit.


446
0:17:48,34 --> 0:17:51,53
That cliff was beat.


447
0:17:51,53 --> 0:17:53,55
That cliff was just beat.


448
0:17:53,55 --> 0:17:57,2
It was just peppery
takeoff huge.


449
0:17:57,2 --> 0:17:58,27
That snow got jacked.


450
0:17:58,27 --> 0:18:0,64



451
0:18:0,64 --> 0:18:1,89
It's good in the chute though.


452
0:18:1,89 --> 0:20:1,89
