0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:1,84



2
0:0:1,84 --> 0:0:4,45
FEMALE SPEAKER: Thank you a
lot for coming to our talk.


3
0:0:4,45 --> 0:0:7,53
It's my pleasure to introduce
today's distinguished guest


4
0:0:7,53 --> 0:0:11,68
speaker, Dr. John Gray, a great
author of the book "Men Are


5
0:0:11,68 --> 0:0:15,67
from Mars, Women Are Venus,"
the best-selling relationship


6
0:0:15,67 --> 0:0:17,3
book of all years.


7
0:0:17,3 --> 0:0:20,83
He wrote 18 other books,
and you can read about them


8
0:0:20,83 --> 0:0:25,32
on his website and his
[INAUDIBLE] publications.


9
0:0:25,32 --> 0:0:27,96
And I won't keep
you longer, and I'll


10
0:0:27,96 --> 0:0:29,86
let John Gray to
speak for himself


11
0:0:29,86 --> 0:0:31,53
and share with you
the differences


12
0:0:31,53 --> 0:0:32,77
between the genders.


13
0:0:32,77 --> 0:0:33,944
Thank you, John, for coming.


14
0:0:33,944 --> 0:0:35,61
JOHN GRAY: Thank you
for having me here.


15
0:0:35,61 --> 0:0:39,85



16
0:0:39,85 --> 0:0:42,44
Well, it's really fun
for me to be at Google,


17
0:0:42,44 --> 0:0:45,61
since I live on Google.


18
0:0:45,61 --> 0:0:48,71
It's a researcher's dream to
be able to Google everything


19
0:0:48,71 --> 0:0:49,36
instantly.


20
0:0:49,36 --> 0:0:51,11
You don't understand
something, Google it.


21
0:0:51,11 --> 0:0:53,834
Understand something, Google it.


22
0:0:53,834 --> 0:0:55,5
I remember one of my
mentors a long time


23
0:0:55,5 --> 0:0:58,44
ago was saying that if, when
you're speaking, if you use one


24
0:0:58,44 --> 0:1:1,51
word that somebody
can't understand,


25
0:1:1,51 --> 0:1:4,43
then they tend to blank out
on everything else you say.


26
0:1:4,43 --> 0:1:6,35
And one of the great
things for Google for me


27
0:1:6,35 --> 0:1:8,109
is I'll be reading
research and this and this,


28
0:1:8,109 --> 0:1:9,983
and if a word comes
along I don't understand,


29
0:1:9,983 --> 0:1:12,897
I can immediately Google
that and come back.


30
0:1:12,897 --> 0:1:14,48
Because to truly
understand something,


31
0:1:14,48 --> 0:1:16,87
you have to actually
understand every word.


32
0:1:16,87 --> 0:1:19,64
But we intuitively think we're
going to get it at the end,


33
0:1:19,64 --> 0:1:21,22
but we don't.


34
0:1:21,22 --> 0:1:23,13
So in my message on
"Men Are from Mars,


35
0:1:23,13 --> 0:1:26,59
Women Are from Venus," what's so
much fun for me is, typically,


36
0:1:26,59 --> 0:1:29,7
people can relate
to the examples


37
0:1:29,7 --> 0:1:31,352
from your own
personal experience.


38
0:1:31,352 --> 0:1:33,31
So just to know you a
little bit as my audience


39
0:1:33,31 --> 0:1:37,464
so I give the right talk, who
has read "Men Are from Mars,


40
0:1:37,464 --> 0:1:38,38
Women Are from Venus"?


41
0:1:38,38 --> 0:1:40,6
How many of you read it?


42
0:1:40,6 --> 0:1:41,755
So a lot of you haven't.


43
0:1:41,755 --> 0:1:45,18
OK, now, how many of you who
haven't have heard of it?


44
0:1:45,18 --> 0:1:48,12
So your parents read it, right?


45
0:1:48,12 --> 0:1:49,8
That was when I knew
I was getting old,


46
0:1:49,8 --> 0:1:50,78
when people would
come up and they'd go,


47
0:1:50,78 --> 0:1:53,5
oh, I love your book,
and my parents read it.


48
0:1:53,5 --> 0:1:55,77



49
0:1:55,77 --> 0:1:57,43
They started going
on walks together.


50
0:1:57,43 --> 0:1:59,85
They actually are so
much happier afterwards,


51
0:1:59,85 --> 0:2:0,7
so they thank me.


52
0:2:0,7 --> 0:2:1,77
And I said, well,
when you get ready,


53
0:2:1,77 --> 0:2:3,7
you'll probably want
to read the book, too.


54
0:2:3,7 --> 0:2:6,3
So I'm going to give-- for those
of you haven't read "Men Are


55
0:2:6,3 --> 0:2:8,449
from Mars"-- some of the basic
ideas of that in our short


56
0:2:8,449 --> 0:2:11,4
presentation, and we'll
also have room for question


57
0:2:11,4 --> 0:2:12,91
and answers, if you
like to ask questions.


58
0:2:12,91 --> 0:2:16,27
I'll also briefly talk about
my most recent book, which


59
0:2:16,27 --> 0:2:19,77
is called "Work with Me,"
which is about 25 books later.


60
0:2:19,77 --> 0:2:22,2
I've applied the
principles of understanding


61
0:2:22,2 --> 0:2:25,712
gender differences
in a positive way.


62
0:2:25,712 --> 0:2:27,67
Because so much of the
time, when men and women


63
0:2:27,67 --> 0:2:30,1
show up differently
in a relationship,


64
0:2:30,1 --> 0:2:33,919
we often have an intuitive
reaction, which is wrong.


65
0:2:33,919 --> 0:2:36,46
How many of you have read the
book called "Slow Thinker, Fast


66
0:2:36,46 --> 0:2:37,84
Thinker"?


67
0:2:37,84 --> 0:2:39,87
It was a good book,
but it talks about most


68
0:2:39,87 --> 0:2:43,46
of our interpretation
of reality is automatic,


69
0:2:43,46 --> 0:2:45,785
kind of like I know that that
building's quite far away,


70
0:2:45,785 --> 0:2:47,2
and you're closer to me.


71
0:2:47,2 --> 0:2:50,7
And when we're in relationships,
when our partners say or do


72
0:2:50,7 --> 0:2:52,94
things, we have an
automatic interpretation,


73
0:2:52,94 --> 0:2:55,97
which is often
wrong, particularly


74
0:2:55,97 --> 0:2:58,1
when it's the opposite sex.


75
0:2:58,1 --> 0:3:0,67
So a lot of my ideas,
I think the popularity


76
0:3:0,67 --> 0:3:2,42
of "Men Are from Mars"
was that you really


77
0:3:2,42 --> 0:3:4,67
don't have to do
anything to change


78
0:3:4,67 --> 0:3:6,677
your relationship to the better.


79
0:3:6,677 --> 0:3:8,51
Because so many of the
problems that couples


80
0:3:8,51 --> 0:3:12,25
have in relationships
is misinterpretation.


81
0:3:12,25 --> 0:3:14,62
And so if you can start
to interpret a situation


82
0:3:14,62 --> 0:3:17,14
correctly, you find
out the problem


83
0:3:17,14 --> 0:3:19,68
is not as big as
you thought it was.


84
0:3:19,68 --> 0:3:22,17
There's an old
Eastern Indian story


85
0:3:22,17 --> 0:3:25,39
of the person who sees a snake
on the ground, and it's dark,


86
0:3:25,39 --> 0:3:28,65
and they start yelling and
screaming, snake, snake.


87
0:3:28,65 --> 0:3:31,87
And somebody turns on the
light, and it's a stick.


88
0:3:31,87 --> 0:3:34,45
So so many of the problems
I see with my couples


89
0:3:34,45 --> 0:3:37,4
as a marriage counselor
are big problems to them,


90
0:3:37,4 --> 0:3:39,63
and then I explain it to
them, and it's a stick,


91
0:3:39,63 --> 0:3:42,24
and then you can
work with the stick.


92
0:3:42,24 --> 0:3:45,37
So in "Work with Me"--
that's the second book


93
0:3:45,37 --> 0:3:46,75
I'll be briefly talking about.


94
0:3:46,75 --> 0:3:49,28
That's my most recent
published book.


95
0:3:49,28 --> 0:3:52,22
It talks about gender
differences in the workplace,


96
0:3:52,22 --> 0:3:55,86
and how are these basic blind
spots between men and women.


97
0:3:55,86 --> 0:3:58,312
And we teach through
human resources


98
0:3:58,312 --> 0:3:59,27
in different companies.


99
0:3:59,27 --> 0:4:2,7
We go in, and we do these
workshops sometimes.


100
0:4:2,7 --> 0:4:7,18
And we did a survey of
over 100,000 men and women


101
0:4:7,18 --> 0:4:7,83
from workshops.


102
0:4:7,83 --> 0:4:10,77
So they filled out this survey
before they took the course.


103
0:4:10,77 --> 0:4:13,49
And we found that there are
these basic blind spots.


104
0:4:13,49 --> 0:4:15,76
There's eight that I focus
on, but I'll mention one


105
0:4:15,76 --> 0:4:19,99
right now, which is
we asked the women,


106
0:4:19,99 --> 0:4:22,95
do you feel appreciated
in the workplace?


107
0:4:22,95 --> 0:4:25,73
And over half of the
women felt they were not


108
0:4:25,73 --> 0:4:28,67
being appreciated by men.


109
0:4:28,67 --> 0:4:31,54
And then we ask the men,
do you appreciate women


110
0:4:31,54 --> 0:4:32,96
in the workplace?


111
0:4:32,96 --> 0:4:37,61
And over 90% of men
said, of course.


112
0:4:37,61 --> 0:4:39,23
So that's a blind spot.


113
0:4:39,23 --> 0:4:42,81
Men think that they're
communicating appreciation,


114
0:4:42,81 --> 0:4:45,85
but women often not
feeling appreciated.


115
0:4:45,85 --> 0:4:48,17
And this gives rise to one
of the basic differences


116
0:4:48,17 --> 0:4:51,49
between men and women, which
is that women feel valued


117
0:4:51,49 --> 0:4:55,15
and appreciated when
you know what they do.


118
0:4:55,15 --> 0:4:59,12
When a man gets paid, get
acknowledged for the result--


119
0:4:59,12 --> 0:5:2,66
good job, you did this, now you
get this promotion or whatever.


120
0:5:2,66 --> 0:5:5,41
That makes a man feel
valued and appreciated.


121
0:5:5,41 --> 0:5:7,31
Acknowledge what I do.


122
0:5:7,31 --> 0:5:10,82
But for a woman, she wants to be
acknowledged for what she does,


123
0:5:10,82 --> 0:5:13,38
but she also wants to be seen.


124
0:5:13,38 --> 0:5:14,91
She wants to be heard.


125
0:5:14,91 --> 0:5:17,4
She wants to be understood.


126
0:5:17,4 --> 0:5:20,0
And this was my first insight
into the world of "Men Are from


127
0:5:20,0 --> 0:5:22,68
Mars, Women Are from
Venus"-- what was it--


128
0:5:22,68 --> 0:5:25,862
over 30 years ago.


129
0:5:25,862 --> 0:5:28,32
Before I realized it, before
I was even married to my wife.


130
0:5:28,32 --> 0:5:30,26
We've been married 28 years.


131
0:5:30,26 --> 0:5:33,19
But Helen is my
assistant 30 years ago.


132
0:5:33,19 --> 0:5:35,82
And Helen comes to me and
says she wants to quit.


133
0:5:35,82 --> 0:5:37,73
And I said, why would
you want to quit?


134
0:5:37,73 --> 0:5:38,54
You're the best.


135
0:5:38,54 --> 0:5:39,54
I just gave you a raise.


136
0:5:39,54 --> 0:5:41,67
You make as much
as me, basically.


137
0:5:41,67 --> 0:5:45,34
And she said, it's
not about the money.


138
0:5:45,34 --> 0:5:48,3
I just don't feel appreciated.


139
0:5:48,3 --> 0:5:49,287
And I said, all right.


140
0:5:49,287 --> 0:5:49,87
Well, hold on.


141
0:5:49,87 --> 0:5:51,18
Why don't you feel appreciated?


142
0:5:51,18 --> 0:5:54,12
Because I thought she
was a gift from heaven.


143
0:5:54,12 --> 0:5:58,36
And she said, well, John, you
don't even know what I do.


144
0:5:58,36 --> 0:6:0,6
And my reaction as
a man was, that's


145
0:6:0,6 --> 0:6:3,85
why I appreciate you so much.


146
0:6:3,85 --> 0:6:6,25
And we laugh because we
can see the logic of that.


147
0:6:6,25 --> 0:6:6,87
Of course.


148
0:6:6,87 --> 0:6:7,85
I don't have to think.


149
0:6:7,85 --> 0:6:8,8
I don't have to plan.


150
0:6:8,8 --> 0:6:9,88
I don't have to do anything.


151
0:6:9,88 --> 0:6:11,7
She made all the arrangements.


152
0:6:11,7 --> 0:6:12,97
She put the money in the bank.


153
0:6:12,97 --> 0:6:12,93
She paid my bills.


154
0:6:12,93 --> 0:6:14,3
She organized my seminars.


155
0:6:14,3 --> 0:6:16,58
She handled all my clients.


156
0:6:16,58 --> 0:6:19,662
I just showed up at work and
counseled eight women today.


157
0:6:19,662 --> 0:6:21,87
Which, by the way, when "Men
Are from Mars" came out,


158
0:6:21,87 --> 0:6:24,7
everybody was so upset at me.


159
0:6:24,7 --> 0:6:25,55
Some people still are.


160
0:6:25,55 --> 0:6:25,93
How do you know this?


161
0:6:25,93 --> 0:6:28,47
I said, well, my
credentials, basically,


162
0:6:28,47 --> 0:6:31,33
as a counselor-- how many
men have sat in a room


163
0:6:31,33 --> 0:6:34,7
and listened to women talk for
eight hours a day for 10 years?


164
0:6:34,7 --> 0:6:37,195



165
0:6:37,195 --> 0:6:39,32
You have to get paid a lot
of money to do that job.


166
0:6:39,32 --> 0:6:43,7



167
0:6:43,7 --> 0:6:48,38
So I said to her, just
let me-- she said,


168
0:6:48,38 --> 0:6:50,77
you don't even know what I do.


169
0:6:50,77 --> 0:6:51,41
And so I caught on very quickly.


170
0:6:51,41 --> 0:6:54,45
I said, well, give me
a week, and let's see.


171
0:6:54,45 --> 0:6:56,57
So Helen continued to
work for me for years.


172
0:6:56,57 --> 0:6:58,88
I just celebrated her birthday
with her just recently.


173
0:6:58,88 --> 0:7:3,7
And all I did differently--
and Helen stayed with me


174
0:7:3,7 --> 0:7:5,56
and felt valued
and appreciated--


175
0:7:5,56 --> 0:7:10,59
was I took five extra minutes
a day to find out what she did.


176
0:7:10,59 --> 0:7:15,0
And once I knew what she did,
then she felt part of a team.


177
0:7:15,0 --> 0:7:17,74
Very important for women
to feel part of a team,


178
0:7:17,74 --> 0:7:19,94
not to feel isolated.


179
0:7:19,94 --> 0:7:22,67
Second thing is she
felt seen, and that I


180
0:7:22,67 --> 0:7:26,8
come in and actually
look at her.


181
0:7:26,8 --> 0:7:30,61
If you're a programmer, an
engineer brain, you're a guy,


182
0:7:30,61 --> 0:7:33,42
eye contact is not
so important for you.


183
0:7:33,42 --> 0:7:34,44
But to women, it is.


184
0:7:34,44 --> 0:7:37,13
Watch women talk, they'll
be looking at each other,


185
0:7:37,13 --> 0:7:39,71
whereas guys could be looking
off or looking down or looking


186
0:7:39,71 --> 0:7:41,42
around, sometimes
looking at each other,


187
0:7:41,42 --> 0:7:43,61
but always when there's a point.


188
0:7:43,61 --> 0:7:46,51
If you're talking
social talk with guys,


189
0:7:46,51 --> 0:7:48,82
we have to be looking at a
football game or a computer


190
0:7:48,82 --> 0:7:49,84
screen.


191
0:7:49,84 --> 0:7:52,52
It was just the other
night, I was at a party


192
0:7:52,52 --> 0:7:55,4
with one of my old friends
who was sitting next to me.


193
0:7:55,4 --> 0:7:56,82
And my wife is
sitting over here.


194
0:7:56,82 --> 0:7:58,236
Actually, it was
Helen's birthday,


195
0:7:58,236 --> 0:7:59,56
and she's sitting in front.


196
0:7:59,56 --> 0:8:2,29
And I'm talking to
Martin, his name is,


197
0:8:2,29 --> 0:8:4,92
and my wife points out
to me 3/4 of the way


198
0:8:4,92 --> 0:8:7,64
into the evening,
John, you're not


199
0:8:7,64 --> 0:8:10,15
looking at Martin when you talk.


200
0:8:10,15 --> 0:8:13,1
You need to look at him.


201
0:8:13,1 --> 0:8:14,74
I said, OK, honey.


202
0:8:14,74 --> 0:8:15,7
I looked at Martin.


203
0:8:15,7 --> 0:8:19,4
He didn't even notice either.


204
0:8:19,4 --> 0:8:22,48
So what I focus on is
the little differences


205
0:8:22,48 --> 0:8:23,49
between men and women.


206
0:8:23,49 --> 0:8:25,89
It's not like a woman
can't do what a man does.


207
0:8:25,89 --> 0:8:27,87
It's not that a man can't
do what a woman does.


208
0:8:27,87 --> 0:8:30,87
And it's not that all men and
all women fit into these slots


209
0:8:30,87 --> 0:8:31,96
so neatly.


210
0:8:31,96 --> 0:8:33,96
Generally, about
10% of men will tend


211
0:8:33,96 --> 0:8:35,99
to relate more the
female examples.


212
0:8:35,99 --> 0:8:39,6
10% of women will relate
more to the male examples.


213
0:8:39,6 --> 0:8:40,63
Women often come up
to me and say, gee,


214
0:8:40,63 --> 0:8:42,749
I feel like I'm from Mars.


215
0:8:42,749 --> 0:8:44,29
And I say, well,
that's conditioning,


216
0:8:44,29 --> 0:8:46,18
to a great extent.


217
0:8:46,18 --> 0:8:48,1
Women today are
conditioned to be like men,


218
0:8:48,1 --> 0:8:50,4
and there's no
safety to acknowledge


219
0:8:50,4 --> 0:8:52,24
feminine aspects of who you are.


220
0:8:52,24 --> 0:8:54,64
And part of my message
is to validate that,


221
0:8:54,64 --> 0:8:57,87
but not to negate if you're
more on your masculine side.


222
0:8:57,87 --> 0:8:58,53
That's great.


223
0:8:58,53 --> 0:9:1,87
That allows you to
often fit into the work


224
0:9:1,87 --> 0:9:3,189
world much better.


225
0:9:3,189 --> 0:9:5,23
And women will say to me
after they read my book,


226
0:9:5,23 --> 0:9:7,39
they say, yeah, I feel
like I've become a man


227
0:9:7,39 --> 0:9:10,91
to become successful, and I'm
very confused when I get home.


228
0:9:10,91 --> 0:9:12,79
It's like I feel split.


229
0:9:12,79 --> 0:9:16,91
So I wrote a book, which is
called "Why Mars and Venus


230
0:9:16,91 --> 0:9:19,52
Collide" before I
wrote this book.


231
0:9:19,52 --> 0:9:22,66
And "Why Mars and
Venus Collide" is--


232
0:9:22,66 --> 0:9:28,18
what's happening today is that
women go into the workplace.


233
0:9:28,18 --> 0:9:31,74
The workplace stimulates
certain hormones.


234
0:9:31,74 --> 0:9:33,24
Now, that hormone is the
hormone is the hormone that


235
0:9:33,24 --> 0:9:35,526
gets produced when
you're solving problems


236
0:9:35,526 --> 0:9:37,525
and particularly when you
have a responsibility,


237
0:9:37,525 --> 0:9:40,78
and it's all up to you, and
you're solving a problem.


238
0:9:40,78 --> 0:9:42,7
Now, what hormone would that be?


239
0:9:42,7 --> 0:9:45,55
That hormone is
called testosterone.


240
0:9:45,55 --> 0:9:47,5
It's the emergency hormone.


241
0:9:47,5 --> 0:9:49,8
It's the hormone when
you feel pressured,


242
0:9:49,8 --> 0:9:51,52
when you feel a sense
of got to go fast.


243
0:9:51,52 --> 0:9:52,55
Got to get this done.


244
0:9:52,55 --> 0:9:53,38
It's up to me.


245
0:9:53,38 --> 0:9:55,22
Nobody else is going to do it.


246
0:9:55,22 --> 0:9:58,319
Or you sacrifice because
it's a difficult thing,


247
0:9:58,319 --> 0:10:0,61
but you say, I can handle
it, because I'm getting paid,


248
0:10:0,61 --> 0:10:2,21
and that's my job.


249
0:10:2,21 --> 0:10:3,89
That's the hormone
only gets produced.


250
0:10:3,89 --> 0:10:5,92
It's testosterone.


251
0:10:5,92 --> 0:10:10,38
Well, the difference between a
woman's body and a man's body


252
0:10:10,38 --> 0:10:12,42
is hormonal.


253
0:10:12,42 --> 0:10:14,79
These are real
physiological differences.


254
0:10:14,79 --> 0:10:19,27
The average male
needs 30 times more


255
0:10:19,27 --> 0:10:22,71
testosterone to
be in a good mood.


256
0:10:22,71 --> 0:10:25,37
The number one cause
of heart disease in men


257
0:10:25,37 --> 0:10:27,4
is a low testosterone.


258
0:10:27,4 --> 0:10:29,84
There's no man that has
a heart attack unless he


259
0:10:29,84 --> 0:10:33,17
has low testosterone,
high estrogen, estrogen


260
0:10:33,17 --> 0:10:35,31
being the feminine hormone.


261
0:10:35,31 --> 0:10:38,64
As men get older, they start
thinking, I want to quit.


262
0:10:38,64 --> 0:10:44,83
That's because faulty diet,
lack of exercise, too many


263
0:10:44,83 --> 0:10:46,76
estrogens in our environment.


264
0:10:46,76 --> 0:10:48,72
What happens is
estrogen levels star


265
0:10:48,72 --> 0:10:53,68
rising, pushing
testosterone levels down.


266
0:10:53,68 --> 0:10:55,77
That is number one
cause of heart disease.


267
0:10:55,77 --> 0:10:57,42
As soon as the
man retires, which


268
0:10:57,42 --> 0:10:59,46
means he doesn't have
work, which means,


269
0:10:59,46 --> 0:11:1,1
I have to get up
and do something.


270
0:11:1,1 --> 0:11:3,31
I have to solve problems.


271
0:11:3,31 --> 0:11:6,15
A man has one year before
his first heart attack.


272
0:11:6,15 --> 0:11:8,81
This is a statistical fact.


273
0:11:8,81 --> 0:11:10,3
So a statistical fact.


274
0:11:10,3 --> 0:11:11,19
Not every man.


275
0:11:11,19 --> 0:11:12,92
But men need to work.


276
0:11:12,92 --> 0:11:15,23
Men need to go out there
and solve problems,


277
0:11:15,23 --> 0:11:18,65
because solving problems
releases testosterone,


278
0:11:18,65 --> 0:11:23,63
and testosterone a hormone
that lowers stress for men.


279
0:11:23,63 --> 0:11:26,58
Does testosterone
lower stress for women?


280
0:11:26,58 --> 0:11:27,92
No.


281
0:11:27,92 --> 0:11:30,81
Does testosterone being
released feel good to women?


282
0:11:30,81 --> 0:11:31,87
Yes.


283
0:11:31,87 --> 0:11:33,6
It feels good.


284
0:11:33,6 --> 0:11:37,4
So women can love
their testosterone job,


285
0:11:37,4 --> 0:11:40,78
but their stress levels
rise and rise and rise.


286
0:11:40,78 --> 0:11:42,53
And this is shown
in a study that


287
0:11:42,53 --> 0:11:46,435
was done in Scandinavian
countries of several hundred


288
0:11:46,435 --> 0:11:48,27
thousand women and
men being tested,


289
0:11:48,27 --> 0:11:50,797
and they found
that-- and this is


290
0:11:50,797 --> 0:11:52,63
one of the areas where
you have the greatest


291
0:11:52,63 --> 0:11:55,87
equality between
men and women-- I


292
0:11:55,87 --> 0:11:57,67
get frustrated when I go there,
because they call it equality.


293
0:11:57,67 --> 0:11:59,99
I call it blindness.


294
0:11:59,99 --> 0:12:2,22
We're all the same,
which we're not the same.


295
0:12:2,22 --> 0:12:3,96
But at least there's
equal respect


296
0:12:3,96 --> 0:12:5,89
for everybody, which
is a good thing.


297
0:12:5,89 --> 0:12:7,87
But real equality is
when you can recognize


298
0:12:7,87 --> 0:12:10,6
the differences in the
spirit of equality,


299
0:12:10,6 --> 0:12:13,73
equal opportunity, equal
respect, regardless


300
0:12:13,73 --> 0:12:18,1
of man, woman, culture,
race, whatever.


301
0:12:18,1 --> 0:12:20,81
So what they found in this
study in Scandinavia--


302
0:12:20,81 --> 0:12:25,49
huge four-country study-- is
that women in the workplace,


303
0:12:25,49 --> 0:12:28,77
their stress levels were
twice as high as men's.


304
0:12:28,77 --> 0:12:31,46



305
0:12:31,46 --> 0:12:34,3
When women came home
from the workplace,


306
0:12:34,3 --> 0:12:37,19
their stress levels were
four times higher than men.


307
0:12:37,19 --> 0:12:39,34
These are averages.


308
0:12:39,34 --> 0:12:43,11
And that basically means their
happiness level is dramatically


309
0:12:43,11 --> 0:12:44,66
declining.


310
0:12:44,66 --> 0:12:47,14
University studies in
America have repeatedly


311
0:12:47,14 --> 0:12:51,2
shown that, in the '70s, women's
happiness level was way up


312
0:12:51,2 --> 0:12:52,85
here, and men's was down here.


313
0:12:52,85 --> 0:12:55,7
Men has pretty much
stayed the same,


314
0:12:55,7 --> 0:12:57,77
and women has
dramatically dropped.


315
0:12:57,77 --> 0:13:0,74
So what you get, as women
move more into the workplace,


316
0:13:0,74 --> 0:13:4,24
as an average, their
happiness goes down.


317
0:13:4,24 --> 0:13:6,4
So what's going on there?


318
0:13:6,4 --> 0:13:7,93
When I say this, I'm
not saying, oh, women


319
0:13:7,93 --> 0:13:9,18
shouldn't be in the workplace.


320
0:13:9,18 --> 0:13:10,0
I have three daughters.


321
0:13:10,0 --> 0:13:11,291
They all have jobs and careers.


322
0:13:11,291 --> 0:13:12,85
I've supported that completely.


323
0:13:12,85 --> 0:13:14,53
But they're happy.


324
0:13:14,53 --> 0:13:16,39
Their stress levels are low.


325
0:13:16,39 --> 0:13:19,31
They're educated to understand--
they have two parts.


326
0:13:19,31 --> 0:13:21,1
We all have two parts.


327
0:13:21,1 --> 0:13:23,82
The masculine side
is solving problems,


328
0:13:23,82 --> 0:13:25,91
releasing testosterone.


329
0:13:25,91 --> 0:13:28,25
If you're a man, that
will lower your stress.


330
0:13:28,25 --> 0:13:30,194
But what lowers
stress for women?


331
0:13:30,194 --> 0:13:31,61
Well, this was a
huge breakthrough


332
0:13:31,61 --> 0:13:37,98
that happened in 2002 at UCLA.


333
0:13:37,98 --> 0:13:42,65
They discovered that the hormone
oxytocin, which is generally


334
0:13:42,65 --> 0:13:49,51
associated childbirth and female
orgasm, the hormone oxytocin


335
0:13:49,51 --> 0:13:51,86
is the hormone that
actually directly lowers


336
0:13:51,86 --> 0:13:53,69
stress for women.


337
0:13:53,69 --> 0:13:57,79
And without an abundance
of oxytocin in your body,


338
0:13:57,79 --> 0:14:1,5
your brain does not have
an off switch, which


339
0:14:1,5 --> 0:14:4,4
means when you have
problems, if a woman's upset,


340
0:14:4,4 --> 0:14:7,13
she's upset for days
and days and days.


341
0:14:7,13 --> 0:14:9,96
She's still thinking about
this, thinking about this.


342
0:14:9,96 --> 0:14:12,99
I was just counseling a couple,
and they were in their 80s.


343
0:14:12,99 --> 0:14:15,37
And they haven't seen
me in about a month,


344
0:14:15,37 --> 0:14:17,9
and she brings up an issue
that happened six weeks ago


345
0:14:17,9 --> 0:14:19,43
or a month ago.


346
0:14:19,43 --> 0:14:21,89
He says, I can't believe she's
still thinking about this.


347
0:14:21,89 --> 0:14:23,4
I said, you don't understand.


348
0:14:23,4 --> 0:14:24,99
Women don't have an off switch.


349
0:14:24,99 --> 0:14:27,504
They keep going around
and around and around.


350
0:14:27,504 --> 0:14:29,67
Now, how many women in this
room can relate to that?


351
0:14:29,67 --> 0:14:32,25
You're not on camera, but
you can relate to that?


352
0:14:32,25 --> 0:14:33,28
I'm getting some nods.


353
0:14:33,28 --> 0:14:34,31
Can I get some arms up?


354
0:14:34,31 --> 0:14:34,99
Let me just see.


355
0:14:34,99 --> 0:14:38,93



356
0:14:38,93 --> 0:14:42,38
They've actually put men
and women on computer scans


357
0:14:42,38 --> 0:14:46,4
when the sun sets, and what
happens for a man and a woman


358
0:14:46,4 --> 0:14:47,57
is very different.


359
0:14:47,57 --> 0:14:50,49
Unless there's an emergency,
you say to the man and woman,


360
0:14:50,49 --> 0:14:52,6
you say, sit down and relax.


361
0:14:52,6 --> 0:14:54,49
And you put your brain
scans on to measure


362
0:14:54,49 --> 0:14:56,35
blood flow in the brain.


363
0:14:56,35 --> 0:14:59,33
And for the woman, as
soon as she sits down,


364
0:14:59,33 --> 0:15:2,18
blood flow increases
to the brain.


365
0:15:2,18 --> 0:15:4,32
Brain activity increases.


366
0:15:4,32 --> 0:15:6,46
You ask her, what
is she thinking?


367
0:15:6,46 --> 0:15:8,64
What is she thinking?


368
0:15:8,64 --> 0:15:10,38
She's thinking
about all the things


369
0:15:10,38 --> 0:15:13,3
she needs to do that
she's not doing it


370
0:15:13,3 --> 0:15:15,71
while she's sitting
here on this couch.


371
0:15:15,71 --> 0:15:17,94
That's her brain
going like this.


372
0:15:17,94 --> 0:15:22,54
You look at the man's brain,
blood flow literally stops.


373
0:15:22,54 --> 0:15:24,58
It just goes back
here to where he


374
0:15:24,58 --> 0:15:28,17
can keep his body temperature
and breathing and so forth.


375
0:15:28,17 --> 0:15:29,9
And you ask him, what
are you thinking?


376
0:15:29,9 --> 0:15:31,23
And what does he say?


377
0:15:31,23 --> 0:15:31,73
Nothing.


378
0:15:31,73 --> 0:15:34,259



379
0:15:34,259 --> 0:15:36,3
And if you didn't have
that test, the woman says,


380
0:15:36,3 --> 0:15:38,3
you must be thinking
of something.


381
0:15:38,3 --> 0:15:41,31
You must be thinking
of something.


382
0:15:41,31 --> 0:15:42,45
And this is the difference.


383
0:15:42,45 --> 0:15:45,11
And so what's going on
there, which I talked about


384
0:15:45,11 --> 0:15:47,8
in "Men Are from Mars" long
before all this research came


385
0:15:47,8 --> 0:15:49,66
about, I just observed it.


386
0:15:49,66 --> 0:15:52,42
Is that men
typically go to work.


387
0:15:52,42 --> 0:15:54,17
They're solving
problems all day.


388
0:15:54,17 --> 0:15:56,47
They're releasing
testosterone, particularly


389
0:15:56,47 --> 0:15:59,68
if a man is successful, which
means he feels confident,


390
0:15:59,68 --> 0:16:1,98
I know how to solve problems.


391
0:16:1,98 --> 0:16:5,13
So if I get in my car, and
I'm driving 100 miles an hour,


392
0:16:5,13 --> 0:16:8,38
if I feel like I'm in a good
car, and I'm a good driver,


393
0:16:8,38 --> 0:16:10,19
actually my stress
level goes down.


394
0:16:10,19 --> 0:16:11,88
How many men can relate to that?


395
0:16:11,88 --> 0:16:13,0
Of course.


396
0:16:13,0 --> 0:16:15,2
You're doing something which
is extremely dangerous,


397
0:16:15,2 --> 0:16:16,24
by the way.


398
0:16:16,24 --> 0:16:18,19
Because if you were to let
go of the steering wheel,


399
0:16:18,19 --> 0:16:19,62
you would die.


400
0:16:19,62 --> 0:16:21,83
Or if a deer ran out in
front of your car, which


401
0:16:21,83 --> 0:16:24,33
you have no control
over, you would die.


402
0:16:24,33 --> 0:16:26,2
But your brain,
basically, you're


403
0:16:26,2 --> 0:16:29,23
producing huge amounts of
testosterone, releasing it,


404
0:16:29,23 --> 0:16:30,16
and dopamine.


405
0:16:30,16 --> 0:16:32,5
Dopamine is the
brain chemical focus,


406
0:16:32,5 --> 0:16:35,33
so you're going right into focus
zone because there's danger.


407
0:16:35,33 --> 0:16:38,68
So dopamine and testosterone
go hand in hand.


408
0:16:38,68 --> 0:16:40,38
So your stress levels
are going down.


409
0:16:40,38 --> 0:16:42,66
So quite often, I noticed
that if I got in an argument


410
0:16:42,66 --> 0:16:44,87
with my wife, or something
was stressing me out,


411
0:16:44,87 --> 0:16:47,66
I'd want to go for
a drive in my car.


412
0:16:47,66 --> 0:16:49,8
And I would just drive a
little faster than usual,


413
0:16:49,8 --> 0:16:52,8
so I have to look front and
backwards for the police.


414
0:16:52,8 --> 0:16:54,54



415
0:16:54,54 --> 0:16:56,401
And I would start to relax.


416
0:16:56,401 --> 0:16:58,15
Now, of course, if my
wife was in the car,


417
0:16:58,15 --> 0:17:1,41
that would raise her
stress levels hugely.


418
0:17:1,41 --> 0:17:4,99
So there's huge differences
here in how we cope with stress.


419
0:17:4,99 --> 0:17:6,78
That's just one little example.


420
0:17:6,78 --> 0:17:8,724
But, typically, what
I would see happening,


421
0:17:8,724 --> 0:17:10,64
what I still see happening,
which a lot of men


422
0:17:10,64 --> 0:17:14,5
don't do now, and this is
part of my message to men,


423
0:17:14,5 --> 0:17:16,819
is that we would go to work,
and we would solve problems,


424
0:17:16,819 --> 0:17:20,15
and we'd come home from work,
and we'd forget problems.


425
0:17:20,15 --> 0:17:21,64
You have to realize,
for thousands


426
0:17:21,64 --> 0:17:24,17
of years, hundreds of
thousands of years--


427
0:17:24,17 --> 0:17:26,349
I've gone 18 times
around the world,


428
0:17:26,349 --> 0:17:28,93
been with indigenous
tribes around the world,


429
0:17:28,93 --> 0:17:31,4
when the sun sets,
the men sit around,


430
0:17:31,4 --> 0:17:34,45
because their job is
in the jungle doing


431
0:17:34,45 --> 0:17:35,93
what they do when
there's sunshine.


432
0:17:35,93 --> 0:17:37,513
Now they're sitting
around, or they're


433
0:17:37,513 --> 0:17:40,19
a guard sitting around
doing nothing, as well.


434
0:17:40,19 --> 0:17:42,48
So they don't move
when the sun sets.


435
0:17:42,48 --> 0:17:44,89
They actually need to relax.


436
0:17:44,89 --> 0:17:47,77
And when they relax, their
brain, in order to relax,


437
0:17:47,77 --> 0:17:49,33
their brain literally
has the ability


438
0:17:49,33 --> 0:17:52,24
to forget stressful messages.


439
0:17:52,24 --> 0:17:55,555
So the way men cope with
stress is you solve problems,


440
0:17:55,555 --> 0:17:59,49
and at the end of the day,
you forget your problems.


441
0:17:59,49 --> 0:18:0,78
And we have a shut off.


442
0:18:0,78 --> 0:18:2,9
We can turn them off.


443
0:18:2,9 --> 0:18:5,55
And when you turn off
your problems, you relax.


444
0:18:5,55 --> 0:18:9,64
And when you relax, your
body rebuilds testosterone.


445
0:18:9,64 --> 0:18:11,75
That's how you
rebuild testosterone


446
0:18:11,75 --> 0:18:14,24
is to do anything a
woman would consider


447
0:18:14,24 --> 0:18:18,22
to be a complete waste of time.


448
0:18:18,22 --> 0:18:19,23
So he'll come home from work.


449
0:18:19,23 --> 0:18:21,73
He'll sit around, maybe watch
the news, sit on his computer,


450
0:18:21,73 --> 0:18:23,627
do something, play a
video game, anything.


451
0:18:23,627 --> 0:18:25,96
And she's going, but we've
got this, and we've got this,


452
0:18:25,96 --> 0:18:26,56
and we've got this.


453
0:18:26,56 --> 0:18:27,2
And there's this.


454
0:18:27,2 --> 0:18:27,8
And you forgot this.


455
0:18:27,8 --> 0:18:28,55
You're not doing this.


456
0:18:28,55 --> 0:18:30,19
And she can't
understand why he's not


457
0:18:30,19 --> 0:18:32,84
attending to all those things.


458
0:18:32,84 --> 0:18:36,45
But he's doing what he has to
do to cope with stress, which


459
0:18:36,45 --> 0:18:39,38
is to turn off all
responsibilities


460
0:18:39,38 --> 0:18:41,66
for a little me time.


461
0:18:41,66 --> 0:18:45,486
And she's going, well, why does
he get me time, and I don't?


462
0:18:45,486 --> 0:18:46,235
Because you can't.


463
0:18:46,235 --> 0:18:50,22



464
0:18:50,22 --> 0:18:51,5
You should be admiring that.


465
0:18:51,5 --> 0:18:54,79
You should be going, I
wish I could do that.


466
0:18:54,79 --> 0:18:56,37
And, of course, women, you
do subconsciously admire it.


467
0:18:56,37 --> 0:18:59,49
This is all the spa magazines,
all the upper level gold


468
0:18:59,49 --> 0:19:0,87
watch magazines.


469
0:19:0,87 --> 0:19:3,46
They always show some
beautiful spa resort place,


470
0:19:3,46 --> 0:19:5,52
and a woman is
sitting in meditation.


471
0:19:5,52 --> 0:19:8,97
And she seems to be so
beatifically calm and peaceful.


472
0:19:8,97 --> 0:19:11,21
You have no idea she's
worrying about 50 things.


473
0:19:11,21 --> 0:19:14,19
But the illusion is that
she can turn off her brain


474
0:19:14,19 --> 0:19:15,97
and be completely
happy like that,


475
0:19:15,97 --> 0:19:17,78
which is an illusion
for women today.


476
0:19:17,78 --> 0:19:19,16
They can't.


477
0:19:19,16 --> 0:19:23,43
But what this research in
1992 showed is how you can.


478
0:19:23,43 --> 0:19:25,56
And you can do it.


479
0:19:25,56 --> 0:19:30,57
The hormone that allows
you to relax is oxytocin.


480
0:19:30,57 --> 0:19:33,97
Oxytocin is stimulated
in a variety of ways.


481
0:19:33,97 --> 0:19:35,79
I've written whole
books on oxytocin,


482
0:19:35,79 --> 0:19:37,312
how to simulate it,
how you lose it,


483
0:19:37,312 --> 0:19:38,52
how you get in, and so forth.


484
0:19:38,52 --> 0:19:40,77
We'll go a little
bit over it today.


485
0:19:40,77 --> 0:19:45,82
And with oxytocin, when a
women is giving love-- OK,


486
0:19:45,82 --> 0:19:49,27
if you're nurturing others,
if you're caring about others,


487
0:19:49,27 --> 0:19:51,78
if you're thinking about others,
if you're helping others--


488
0:19:51,78 --> 0:19:54,73
basically, if you're taking care
of your kids-- because women,


489
0:19:54,73 --> 0:19:56,415
for thousands and
thousands of years,


490
0:19:56,415 --> 0:19:57,79
if you go to an
indigenous tribe,


491
0:19:57,79 --> 0:20:0,18
you'll see the babies are
being born every year.


492
0:20:0,18 --> 0:20:1,997
Women are just pregnant
most of the time.


493
0:20:1,997 --> 0:20:3,33
They're taking care of the kids.


494
0:20:3,33 --> 0:20:4,746
When the sun sets,
the men are all


495
0:20:4,746 --> 0:20:7,27
sitting around doing nothing,
sharpening their tools


496
0:20:7,27 --> 0:20:10,67
or whatever, telling stories,
or not talking at all.


497
0:20:10,67 --> 0:20:12,85
Women are completely busy.


498
0:20:12,85 --> 0:20:16,13
They're nonstop action,
nonstop busy, busy, busy.


499
0:20:16,13 --> 0:20:19,45
But their stress levels
are dramatically low.


500
0:20:19,45 --> 0:20:22,25
What is lowering their stress?


501
0:20:22,25 --> 0:20:23,9
When you feel you're
in an environment


502
0:20:23,9 --> 0:20:26,27
where there's no time pressure.


503
0:20:26,27 --> 0:20:30,37
The number one inhibitor
of oxytocin production


504
0:20:30,37 --> 0:20:33,14
is feeling not enough time.


505
0:20:33,14 --> 0:20:35,28
The number one complaint
I hear from women


506
0:20:35,28 --> 0:20:39,19
today is not enough time.


507
0:20:39,19 --> 0:20:42,75
There's too much to do, and
there's not enough time.


508
0:20:42,75 --> 0:20:46,8
And when you feel, as a woman,
there's not enough time for me


509
0:20:46,8 --> 0:20:48,23
to do what I'd like
to do, to do what


510
0:20:48,23 --> 0:20:51,71
I enjoy doing-- it's a huge,
perplexing thing for men when


511
0:20:51,71 --> 0:20:54,84
we see women say, I
have no time for me.


512
0:20:54,84 --> 0:20:57,82
He'll take a deep breath and
go, how is that even possible?


513
0:20:57,82 --> 0:21:1,89
Because if a guy runs out of
time for me, he just takes it.


514
0:21:1,89 --> 0:21:3,69
But when a woman is
feeling stressed,


515
0:21:3,69 --> 0:21:6,82
your mechanism to
lower stress is


516
0:21:6,82 --> 0:21:10,74
to nurture others
and release oxytocin.


517
0:21:10,74 --> 0:21:13,46
Oxytocin, when you're
giving to other people,


518
0:21:13,46 --> 0:21:16,63
caring for others, being
concerned for others,


519
0:21:16,63 --> 0:21:19,66
doing for others-- not
necessarily solving problems--


520
0:21:19,66 --> 0:21:22,1
being in a social relationship,
listening to someone,


521
0:21:22,1 --> 0:21:23,25
helping them, whatever.


522
0:21:23,25 --> 0:21:26,79
It's not so much solving
problems as nurturing.


523
0:21:26,79 --> 0:21:28,72
See, here's the difference
between nurturing,


524
0:21:28,72 --> 0:21:39,13
which is oxytocin-releasing,
and problem solving


525
0:21:39,13 --> 0:21:41,14
is testosterone-producing.


526
0:21:41,14 --> 0:21:42,7
So my wife is a gardener.


527
0:21:42,7 --> 0:21:44,48
When she's planting
her seeds, when


528
0:21:44,48 --> 0:21:48,1
she's caring for her
seeds, that's nurturing.


529
0:21:48,1 --> 0:21:51,42
When the irrigation
system is broken,


530
0:21:51,42 --> 0:21:55,76
and water is spurting up,
that's solving a problem.


531
0:21:55,76 --> 0:21:58,41
So you see how solving a problem
is the illusion that I'll


532
0:21:58,41 --> 0:22:0,75
solve it, and it's done forever.


533
0:22:0,75 --> 0:22:2,25
And then, of course,
they come back.


534
0:22:2,25 --> 0:22:5,21
So men make great
emergency workers.


535
0:22:5,21 --> 0:22:8,9
A big problem comes,
I'm going to solve it.


536
0:22:8,9 --> 0:22:10,18
Then you feel like,
ah, now I can rest.


537
0:22:10,18 --> 0:22:10,75
Relax.


538
0:22:10,75 --> 0:22:12,16
Forget about that.


539
0:22:12,16 --> 0:22:15,83
But women are designed to
not forget about things.


540
0:22:15,83 --> 0:22:17,44
This is the big
complaint men have,


541
0:22:17,44 --> 0:22:20,5
is 30 years in-- I'll just
do a funny story here.


542
0:22:20,5 --> 0:22:22,85
My wife and I were in
the Galapagos Islands.


543
0:22:22,85 --> 0:22:26,1
You know, the Galapagos
turtles live long lives.


544
0:22:26,1 --> 0:22:28,3
There's a T-shirt
they're selling there,


545
0:22:28,3 --> 0:22:31,55
it's these two old
turtles talking,


546
0:22:31,55 --> 0:22:35,21
and the husband's saying to
the female turtle, honey,


547
0:22:35,21 --> 0:22:39,706
the affair was 97 years ago.


548
0:22:39,706 --> 0:22:42,9
Can we let it go?


549
0:22:42,9 --> 0:22:46,79
When she's under stress,
all of her memories come up.


550
0:22:46,79 --> 0:22:49,37
See, this is how
women cope with stress


551
0:22:49,37 --> 0:22:52,21
is talking about what's
stressing you out.


552
0:22:52,21 --> 0:22:53,81
So the memories come up.


553
0:22:53,81 --> 0:22:56,46
Men cope with stress by
forgetting those things.


554
0:22:56,46 --> 0:22:57,3
Forget it.


555
0:22:57,3 --> 0:22:57,75
Forget it.


556
0:22:57,75 --> 0:23:0,3
So a woman's busy talking
about stressful things,


557
0:23:0,3 --> 0:23:2,37
and a man goes, just forget it.


558
0:23:2,37 --> 0:23:3,38
Don't worry about it.


559
0:23:3,38 --> 0:23:4,479
It's not a big deal.


560
0:23:4,479 --> 0:23:5,77
Just do this and this and this.


561
0:23:5,77 --> 0:23:7,279
Don't take that exit next time.


562
0:23:7,279 --> 0:23:9,57
And the worst is the man will
listen to you complaining


563
0:23:9,57 --> 0:23:12,97
about your job, he'll
say, just quit that job.


564
0:23:12,97 --> 0:23:14,98
You can get another job.


565
0:23:14,98 --> 0:23:18,52
As if you're going to say,
gee, I hadn't thought of that.


566
0:23:18,52 --> 0:23:19,7
What a brilliant idea.


567
0:23:19,7 --> 0:23:20,908
No wonder I'm married to you.


568
0:23:20,908 --> 0:23:22,57
You're so smart.


569
0:23:22,57 --> 0:23:26,17
But, see, when a man hears a
problem, he wants to kill it.


570
0:23:26,17 --> 0:23:28,42
Basically, it's run
from it or kill it.


571
0:23:28,42 --> 0:23:29,0
Solve it.


572
0:23:29,0 --> 0:23:29,93
Fix it.


573
0:23:29,93 --> 0:23:32,66
Because that releases
testosterone.


574
0:23:32,66 --> 0:23:34,31
Then he relaxes.


575
0:23:34,31 --> 0:23:40,57
For a woman, testosterone does
not lower her cortisol levels.


576
0:23:40,57 --> 0:23:42,18
It doesn't raise them.


577
0:23:42,18 --> 0:23:44,45
It just doesn't lower them.


578
0:23:44,45 --> 0:23:50,69
So what lowers stress levels
for women is oxytocin.


579
0:23:50,69 --> 0:23:51,38
Ah.


580
0:23:51,38 --> 0:23:53,53
So now when you're in a
personal relationship,


581
0:23:53,53 --> 0:23:57,57
and you're nurturing others,
you're releasing your oxytocin.


582
0:23:57,57 --> 0:23:59,62
Your stress levels goes down.


583
0:23:59,62 --> 0:24:0,91
But guess what?


584
0:24:0,91 --> 0:24:5,72
Giving doesn't
rebuild your oxytocin.


585
0:24:5,72 --> 0:24:9,7
What rebuilds oxytocin
so you have it to give


586
0:24:9,7 --> 0:24:12,48
is when you feel you're
receiving support.


587
0:24:12,48 --> 0:24:15,57
So, for women, everything
is about reciprocity.


588
0:24:15,57 --> 0:24:17,92
It's I give, and I get back.


589
0:24:17,92 --> 0:24:20,83
I give-- if you're my friend,
I do something for you,


590
0:24:20,83 --> 0:24:23,94
and now you're obligated
to do something back.


591
0:24:23,94 --> 0:24:26,92
If we're two girlfriends,
and I call you up,


592
0:24:26,92 --> 0:24:29,51
with the first thing
I'll do is a woman


593
0:24:29,51 --> 0:24:31,3
is say, tell me about your kids.


594
0:24:31,3 --> 0:24:32,25
Or tell me about this.


595
0:24:32,25 --> 0:24:34,0
It's like I remember
everything about you,


596
0:24:34,0 --> 0:24:36,19
and I ask lots of
questions, get you talking,


597
0:24:36,19 --> 0:24:38,29
and now you owe me five
minutes of listening.


598
0:24:38,29 --> 0:24:41,4



599
0:24:41,4 --> 0:24:43,73
Women can't believe when a
guy will talk about himself


600
0:24:43,73 --> 0:24:45,87
and then not ask her questions.


601
0:24:45,87 --> 0:24:47,81
It's like, how can he
just talk about himself?


602
0:24:47,81 --> 0:24:51,93
And he's over here thinking, why
does she have nothing to say?


603
0:24:51,93 --> 0:24:54,79
Because women eagerly ask
questions to draw somebody out


604
0:24:54,79 --> 0:24:58,1
because they so much
value being heard.


605
0:24:58,1 --> 0:25:0,77
See me, hear me, touch me.


606
0:25:0,77 --> 0:25:5,18
All of these things
are oxytocin producers.


607
0:25:5,18 --> 0:25:7,356
So that if you feel
seen and heard,


608
0:25:7,356 --> 0:25:8,73
and you feel backed
up, if you're


609
0:25:8,73 --> 0:25:10,86
part of a team-- and
this is women in tribes.


610
0:25:10,86 --> 0:25:13,54
Women have always
been in tribes.


611
0:25:13,54 --> 0:25:14,86
You go to indigenous cultures.


612
0:25:14,86 --> 0:25:17,79
They're doing everything
together, all the time.


613
0:25:17,79 --> 0:25:20,38
And there's never any
rushing, by the way.


614
0:25:20,38 --> 0:25:22,26
There's a sense of support.


615
0:25:22,26 --> 0:25:24,57
It's that you feel that you
have support at all times.


616
0:25:24,57 --> 0:25:26,66
It's not like you need
that support all the time.


617
0:25:26,66 --> 0:25:28,76
It's not I like you're
this needy person.


618
0:25:28,76 --> 0:25:31,48
It's just that you
always have backup.


619
0:25:31,48 --> 0:25:33,59
And so women, because
their instinct is always


620
0:25:33,59 --> 0:25:36,38
to be giving, because
giving releases oxytocin,


621
0:25:36,38 --> 0:25:39,37
and you have a rewards
system to make you feel good.


622
0:25:39,37 --> 0:25:41,41
Women are busy always
giving, but if it's


623
0:25:41,41 --> 0:25:44,44
all women you're working with,
all day long, everybody's


624
0:25:44,44 --> 0:25:48,305
giving, so
everybody's receiving.


625
0:25:48,305 --> 0:25:50,43
And suddenly, you take a
women and put them in hand


626
0:25:50,43 --> 0:25:53,75
with men, who don't
live in that world.


627
0:25:53,75 --> 0:25:57,63
Or in a corporate environment,
it isn't structured that way.


628
0:25:57,63 --> 0:26:1,37
See, the whole difference of
Mars world and Venus world,


629
0:26:1,37 --> 0:26:3,19
we have to blend them together.


630
0:26:3,19 --> 0:26:4,27
One is not bad.


631
0:26:4,27 --> 0:26:5,67
One's not better.


632
0:26:5,67 --> 0:26:8,95
But to make sense of it,
you look at the two worlds.


633
0:26:8,95 --> 0:26:12,39
In the Mars world,
the strong survive.


634
0:26:12,39 --> 0:26:15,53
The better you are, the
bigger result you get.


635
0:26:15,53 --> 0:26:18,9
The harder you work, the smarter
you are, the bigger result.


636
0:26:18,9 --> 0:26:19,2
You get paid more.


637
0:26:19,2 --> 0:26:21,35
Gee, he didn't get paid
much, but look what you did.


638
0:26:21,35 --> 0:26:23,12
You got more.


639
0:26:23,12 --> 0:26:28,79
At home, in the personal world,
the child who is the sickest


640
0:26:28,79 --> 0:26:30,64
gets more.


641
0:26:30,64 --> 0:26:32,3
They get more attention.


642
0:26:32,3 --> 0:26:33,8
They get more help.


643
0:26:33,8 --> 0:26:34,27
They get more support.


644
0:26:34,27 --> 0:26:36,0
And everybody gets
what they need.


645
0:26:36,0 --> 0:26:39,27
It's not what you earn,
it's what you need.


646
0:26:39,27 --> 0:26:41,11
But you don't go into your
boss and say, you know,


647
0:26:41,11 --> 0:26:44,32
I really need that job.


648
0:26:44,32 --> 0:26:46,776
Your chances of
getting it go down.


649
0:26:46,776 --> 0:26:48,15
It's like, I've
earned this role.


650
0:26:48,15 --> 0:26:48,93
Look what I've done.


651
0:26:48,93 --> 0:26:50,96
I do this and this and this.


652
0:26:50,96 --> 0:26:52,6
Therefore, I should
get this reward.


653
0:26:52,6 --> 0:26:55,15
These are two different
worlds of thinking


654
0:26:55,15 --> 0:26:58,76
that blend together, and this
is the male female relationship,


655
0:26:58,76 --> 0:27:2,44
which is a new experiment
on planet Earth.


656
0:27:2,44 --> 0:27:4,23
If you go to any the
indigenous tribes--


657
0:27:4,23 --> 0:27:6,85
we're talking thousands and
thousands of years of history.


658
0:27:6,85 --> 0:27:11,88
Go visit in Africa, you'll
see two fires at night.


659
0:27:11,88 --> 0:27:14,75
Women around one,
men around another.


660
0:27:14,75 --> 0:27:15,59
Go to the Amazon.


661
0:27:15,59 --> 0:27:18,534
I was just in your
Google Maps area


662
0:27:18,534 --> 0:27:19,95
where you can see
the whole world,


663
0:27:19,95 --> 0:27:22,45
and I was going all
these places I've been.


664
0:27:22,45 --> 0:27:23,552
Go down to the Amazon.


665
0:27:23,552 --> 0:27:24,26
Go to the Amazon.


666
0:27:24,26 --> 0:27:27,86
You'll see, at night,
men are sitting around.


667
0:27:27,86 --> 0:27:29,95
Women are behind a
wall, and they're


668
0:27:29,95 --> 0:27:33,3
all busy with the children and
cooking and cleaning and making


669
0:27:33,3 --> 0:27:36,289
alcoholic beverages
to give to the men.


670
0:27:36,289 --> 0:27:38,8
How do they make those
alcoholic beverages?


671
0:27:38,8 --> 0:27:39,99
Just little trivia here.


672
0:27:39,99 --> 0:27:42,37
They chew these roots.


673
0:27:42,37 --> 0:27:45,0
They masticate them,
chew them, and spit them


674
0:27:45,0 --> 0:27:48,32
into this bowl with a
little heat under it.


675
0:27:48,32 --> 0:27:50,6
And if they go for
three or four days,


676
0:27:50,6 --> 0:27:52,46
it becomes very alcoholic.


677
0:27:52,46 --> 0:27:53,67
So the men are all
just sitting around.


678
0:27:53,67 --> 0:27:55,128
The women come out
with their bowls


679
0:27:55,128 --> 0:27:56,95
occasionally and hand
it to their husbands.


680
0:27:56,95 --> 0:27:59,24
And there I am with the
chief, so the chief's wife


681
0:27:59,24 --> 0:28:0,35
gave me his bowl.


682
0:28:0,35 --> 0:28:3,71
It was this big on--
just tasted terrible.


683
0:28:3,71 --> 0:28:7,59



684
0:28:7,59 --> 0:28:9,68
That chief, by the
way, [INAUDIBLE] chief,


685
0:28:9,68 --> 0:28:13,37
he was also very proud of
his seven shrunken heads.


686
0:28:13,37 --> 0:28:14,92
They do exist.


687
0:28:14,92 --> 0:28:19,66
And through my two translators
asking him, why do you do that?


688
0:28:19,66 --> 0:28:21,48
He says, oh, very clear.


689
0:28:21,48 --> 0:28:23,622
I have seven children.


690
0:28:23,622 --> 0:28:25,41
I said, well,
explain that to me.


691
0:28:25,41 --> 0:28:27,41
He says, well, the jungle
only has so much food,


692
0:28:27,41 --> 0:28:31,212
and you can only get so much
from your grocery store.


693
0:28:31,212 --> 0:28:33,42
And if you're going to bring
a child into this world,


694
0:28:33,42 --> 0:28:37,2
you have to eliminate somebody
from a neighboring tribe.


695
0:28:37,2 --> 0:28:39,4
Otherwise, there will
be a shortage of food.


696
0:28:39,4 --> 0:28:42,35
That was their
sustainability program.


697
0:28:42,35 --> 0:28:45,91
I think we've come a long way.


698
0:28:45,91 --> 0:28:49,34
It's tribal thinking versus
global consciousness.


699
0:28:49,34 --> 0:28:50,94
Now we're moving
into the world where


700
0:28:50,94 --> 0:28:53,81
if I hurt someone out
there, I'm hurting myself.


701
0:28:53,81 --> 0:28:55,81
And the history of
tribal consciousness


702
0:28:55,81 --> 0:28:57,31
is I don't care about them.


703
0:28:57,31 --> 0:28:58,53
I care about my children.


704
0:28:58,53 --> 0:28:59,73
That's a mafia family.


705
0:28:59,73 --> 0:29:1,67
Mafia fathers are very
loving to their kids


706
0:29:1,67 --> 0:29:6,31
as long as they say yes,
but not to anybody else.


707
0:29:6,31 --> 0:29:8,34
So this, we're trying
to get out to see,


708
0:29:8,34 --> 0:29:10,52
and that's the experience
of the heart opening.


709
0:29:10,52 --> 0:29:13,13
And, ultimately, this happens
through this great experiment


710
0:29:13,13 --> 0:29:15,8
of romance, men and
women coming together


711
0:29:15,8 --> 0:29:18,2
in romantic relationships.


712
0:29:18,2 --> 0:29:21,71
You seek out, you find someone
that your heart opens to.


713
0:29:21,71 --> 0:29:25,2
And can you keep your heart
open to the same person who's


714
0:29:25,2 --> 0:29:26,674
not perfect?


715
0:29:26,674 --> 0:29:28,9
Say, for the first
three years, it


716
0:29:28,9 --> 0:29:32,59
seems as though they're perfect,
and then reality sets in.


717
0:29:32,59 --> 0:29:36,98
And reality sets in because
when you meet someone new,


718
0:29:36,98 --> 0:29:39,16
and there's sexual
attraction, your brain


719
0:29:39,16 --> 0:29:42,65
produces massive
amounts of dopamine.


720
0:29:42,65 --> 0:29:45,492
How many are familiar
with the term dopamine?


721
0:29:45,492 --> 0:29:47,2
That's when you're
driving your car fast.


722
0:29:47,2 --> 0:29:48,99
That's when you're really
focused on a project.


723
0:29:48,99 --> 0:29:50,12
That's when you're
getting a reward.


724
0:29:50,12 --> 0:29:51,57
That's when there's danger.


725
0:29:51,57 --> 0:29:52,72
That's when there's sex.


726
0:29:52,72 --> 0:29:58,81
That's when you're doing--
any addictive substances goes


727
0:29:58,81 --> 0:30:0,99
into the nucleus
accumbens, where dopamine


728
0:30:0,99 --> 0:30:2,14
produces lots of pleasure.


729
0:30:2,14 --> 0:30:4,95
So anything that's pleasurable
for you is producing dopamine.


730
0:30:4,95 --> 0:30:7,98



731
0:30:7,98 --> 0:30:9,68
So in the first
three years, one of


732
0:30:9,68 --> 0:30:14,1
the major dopamine
simulators is newness.


733
0:30:14,1 --> 0:30:16,68
Newness stimulates dopamine.


734
0:30:16,68 --> 0:30:19,73
Now, what is the
opposite of newness?


735
0:30:19,73 --> 0:30:21,47
Not newness.


736
0:30:21,47 --> 0:30:23,72
And what happens
after three years?


737
0:30:23,72 --> 0:30:24,62
It's not new.


738
0:30:24,62 --> 0:30:26,12
And then to make
things worse, when


739
0:30:26,12 --> 0:30:29,38
you have an argument, what
does she generally do?


740
0:30:29,38 --> 0:30:31,57
She brings up the past.


741
0:30:31,57 --> 0:30:33,42
So there's definitely not new.


742
0:30:33,42 --> 0:30:35,19
It's the worst thing
couples can do.


743
0:30:35,19 --> 0:30:37,31
And I'm not putting it on
her, because she'll start it,


744
0:30:37,31 --> 0:30:38,934
but then he'll come
back, and now he'll


745
0:30:38,934 --> 0:30:41,17
start going into the past, too.


746
0:30:41,17 --> 0:30:43,54
And now you're both
living in the past.


747
0:30:43,54 --> 0:30:45,67
As soon as you can't
be in present time,


748
0:30:45,67 --> 0:30:48,13
dopamine levels start
decreasing, decreasing,


749
0:30:48,13 --> 0:30:48,73
decreasing.


750
0:30:48,73 --> 0:30:51,14
All that passion you
felt in the beginning


751
0:30:51,14 --> 0:30:54,24
dissipates after
three years unless you


752
0:30:54,24 --> 0:30:56,16
have relationship skills.


753
0:30:56,16 --> 0:30:58,22
You have to understand
the software.


754
0:30:58,22 --> 0:30:59,79
With so many of
you into software--


755
0:30:59,79 --> 0:31:1,98
that's how I got into this
whole relationship thing.


756
0:31:1,98 --> 0:31:3,49
I used to work as
a programmer back


757
0:31:3,49 --> 0:31:7,48
in the days of Stanford
Research Institute and COBOL.


758
0:31:7,48 --> 0:31:9,7
So I used to program
the computers.


759
0:31:9,7 --> 0:31:12,16
At a certain point, I realized
I should program people.


760
0:31:12,16 --> 0:31:13,97
So I had that very
analytical perspective


761
0:31:13,97 --> 0:31:15,803
that men are like this,
women are like this.


762
0:31:15,803 --> 0:31:17,2
If we do this, then this.


763
0:31:17,2 --> 0:31:18,58
If we do this, then that.


764
0:31:18,58 --> 0:31:20,3
And we can see it predictively.


765
0:31:20,3 --> 0:31:22,801
A man comes home-- he
doesn't know anything


766
0:31:22,801 --> 0:31:24,3
about men and women
differences-- he


767
0:31:24,3 --> 0:31:25,1
says, hi, honey.


768
0:31:25,1 --> 0:31:27,92
And he goes and sits
down and reads a book.


769
0:31:27,92 --> 0:31:30,1
And she's going, is that it?


770
0:31:30,1 --> 0:31:31,66
He used to be excited to see me.


771
0:31:31,66 --> 0:31:34,16
Matter of fact, what she'll do
if they're married in a house


772
0:31:34,16 --> 0:31:36,36
is he comes home,
she'll test them.


773
0:31:36,36 --> 0:31:40,0
She'll go to another part
of the house and wonder,


774
0:31:40,0 --> 0:31:40,94
does he even miss me?


775
0:31:40,94 --> 0:31:42,42
Does he care about me?


776
0:31:42,42 --> 0:31:44,55
She's playing hide ad seek,
Venusian hide and seek.


777
0:31:44,55 --> 0:31:47,24
I'm hiding, and you're
supposed to find me.


778
0:31:47,24 --> 0:31:50,87
So she's going, I could be
dead, and he wouldn't even care.


779
0:31:50,87 --> 0:31:53,871
And he's from Mars-- he has
his own little hide and seek.


780
0:31:53,871 --> 0:31:55,62
Men come home-- he
goes, she's not around.


781
0:31:55,62 --> 0:31:56,119
Good.


782
0:31:56,119 --> 0:31:58,69



783
0:31:58,69 --> 0:32:2,23
He just wants to be alone, no
interference, nobody calling


784
0:32:2,23 --> 0:32:3,856
on, nobody asking for anything.


785
0:32:3,856 --> 0:32:5,23
Just give me a
break for a while.


786
0:32:5,23 --> 0:32:6,604
So he's playing
hide and go seek,


787
0:32:6,604 --> 0:32:8,73
but the rules are,
don't find me.


788
0:32:8,73 --> 0:32:9,91
He doesn't want to be found.


789
0:32:9,91 --> 0:32:13,4
She wants to be found.


790
0:32:13,4 --> 0:32:16,84
Men solve problems to feel
better and then forget them.


791
0:32:16,84 --> 0:32:19,2
The easiest way to solve
a problem is forget it.


792
0:32:19,2 --> 0:32:19,69
Manana.


793
0:32:19,69 --> 0:32:20,28
Tomorrow.


794
0:32:20,28 --> 0:32:21,894
I don't have to
deal with it now.


795
0:32:21,894 --> 0:32:23,81
And that's what we're
trying to help you with,


796
0:32:23,81 --> 0:32:25,36
but it doesn't work for her.


797
0:32:25,36 --> 0:32:27,9
And she'll be
talking about things


798
0:32:27,9 --> 0:32:29,79
and just blows him
out of the water.


799
0:32:29,79 --> 0:32:31,36
He goes, oh, my gosh.


800
0:32:31,36 --> 0:32:33,53
I'll make $1 million on a book.


801
0:32:33,53 --> 0:32:35,44
We'll be doing a bunch
of fun stuff together.


802
0:32:35,44 --> 0:32:37,71
I'll come home one
day a week later,


803
0:32:37,71 --> 0:32:40,81
and I'll leave a glass
out on the counter.


804
0:32:40,81 --> 0:32:44,78
And she'll lose it
and go, ugh, is it


805
0:32:44,78 --> 0:32:49,1
that hard to put your
glass this far over to here


806
0:32:49,1 --> 0:32:50,63
and put in the dishwasher?


807
0:32:50,63 --> 0:32:52,85
I mean, can't you at
least put it there?


808
0:32:52,85 --> 0:32:57,135
And I'm like, what is
she, nuts or something?


809
0:32:57,135 --> 0:32:59,92
We're, like, the luckiest
people in the world.


810
0:32:59,92 --> 0:33:2,78
We're having an argument over
a glass, which is right here?


811
0:33:2,78 --> 0:33:4,15
How could she do that?


812
0:33:4,15 --> 0:33:6,0
But when you understand
her world-- and part


813
0:33:6,0 --> 0:33:7,7
of the craziness,
from my perspective,


814
0:33:7,7 --> 0:33:10,1
is two days before,
it was a big bunch


815
0:33:10,1 --> 0:33:11,85
of all these dishes
were everywhere.


816
0:33:11,85 --> 0:33:13,142
It was piling up and piling up.


817
0:33:13,142 --> 0:33:14,683
It was some party
we had, and nothing


818
0:33:14,683 --> 0:33:16,2
had been done for a couple days.


819
0:33:16,2 --> 0:33:19,18
So she had spent much
of the day cleaning up.


820
0:33:19,18 --> 0:33:21,73
So it was completely clear--
so you have to imagine this.


821
0:33:21,73 --> 0:33:23,396
You've been living
with trash, and women


822
0:33:23,396 --> 0:33:24,73
see this 10 times more than men.


823
0:33:24,73 --> 0:33:26,562
They actually have more
cells in their eyes.


824
0:33:26,562 --> 0:33:27,7
They see it.


825
0:33:27,7 --> 0:33:27,986
They can't ignore it.


826
0:33:27,986 --> 0:33:28,61
Guy comes home.


827
0:33:28,61 --> 0:33:29,57
He sees his TV set.


828
0:33:29,57 --> 0:33:30,835
That's it.


829
0:33:30,835 --> 0:33:31,71
Doesn't see anything.


830
0:33:31,71 --> 0:33:34,31
She sees everything,
and it's hard to relax


831
0:33:34,31 --> 0:33:37,8
if it's not in order, organized.


832
0:33:37,8 --> 0:33:37,93
So here it is.


833
0:33:37,93 --> 0:33:39,26
It's been cleaned up.


834
0:33:39,26 --> 0:33:41,572
She spent all day
cleaning it up.


835
0:33:41,572 --> 0:33:43,77
And from her point,
can't there just


836
0:33:43,77 --> 0:33:47,52
be a moment where it
stays so pretty and nice?


837
0:33:47,52 --> 0:33:48,836
So it just triggered a button.


838
0:33:48,836 --> 0:33:50,85
She had an emotional reaction.


839
0:33:50,85 --> 0:33:52,34
And when women have
emotional reactions, see,


840
0:33:52,34 --> 0:33:54,45
men think that that
emotional reaction is just


841
0:33:54,45 --> 0:33:56,23
about the glass.


842
0:33:56,23 --> 0:33:59,39
But it's never about just the
first thing she talks about.


843
0:33:59,39 --> 0:34:0,59
That's just the warm up.


844
0:34:0,59 --> 0:34:4,0
That's the foreplay for the
big story that's about to come.


845
0:34:4,0 --> 0:34:6,42
She's got all kinds of
things that are bothering her


846
0:34:6,42 --> 0:34:7,69
that have been building up.


847
0:34:7,69 --> 0:34:10,52
It's like, for women,
it's like the straw that


848
0:34:10,52 --> 0:34:12,469
breaks the camel's back.


849
0:34:12,469 --> 0:34:15,35
Women hold this stress up,
this stress up, this stress up.


850
0:34:15,35 --> 0:34:19,6
And finally something happens,
and it starts to come out.


851
0:34:19,6 --> 0:34:21,71
And when it comes out, a
guy thinks you're nuts.


852
0:34:21,71 --> 0:34:24,279
But here's a way to help, ,
again interpret each other


853
0:34:24,279 --> 0:34:24,779
correctly.


854
0:34:24,779 --> 0:34:25,78
She's not nuts at all.


855
0:34:25,78 --> 0:34:27,76
It's just that she
has a greater need


856
0:34:27,76 --> 0:34:30,59
to talk about what's
bothering her.


857
0:34:30,59 --> 0:34:33,79
Men have a greater need to
forget what's bothering them.


858
0:34:33,79 --> 0:34:36,7
So our job is to
forget about it.


859
0:34:36,7 --> 0:34:40,111
Her job is to talk about it.


860
0:34:40,111 --> 0:34:41,36
So here's a little difference.


861
0:34:41,36 --> 0:34:44,357
We come into some physiology.


862
0:34:44,357 --> 0:34:45,94
The emotional part
of the brain called


863
0:34:45,94 --> 0:34:49,65
the limbic system is twice
as big in a woman than a man.


864
0:34:49,65 --> 0:34:50,54
Big difference.


865
0:34:50,54 --> 0:34:52,57
Twice as big.


866
0:34:52,57 --> 0:34:56,719
Under moderate stress, a woman
will experience eight times


867
0:34:56,719 --> 0:35:0,19
more blood flow to the
emotional part of the brain.


868
0:35:0,19 --> 0:35:1,8
Under moderate stress.


869
0:35:1,8 --> 0:35:6,41
Under extreme stress, a man
will experience that blood flow,


870
0:35:6,41 --> 0:35:9,16
but the problem has
to be really big.


871
0:35:9,16 --> 0:35:11,4
Women will experience
an emotional reaction


872
0:35:11,4 --> 0:35:13,47
to small problems.


873
0:35:13,47 --> 0:35:16,62
And so a man misinterprets
her emotional reaction


874
0:35:16,62 --> 0:35:18,98
as if she's saying
the problem is big,


875
0:35:18,98 --> 0:35:20,689
and she doesn't know
what to do about it.


876
0:35:20,689 --> 0:35:23,104
So we're constantly seeing
women, when they get emotional,


877
0:35:23,104 --> 0:35:24,87
it's like, what, she
can't handle that?


878
0:35:24,87 --> 0:35:26,75
She's not saying, I
can't handle that.


879
0:35:26,75 --> 0:35:29,21
She's just having an
emotional response to it


880
0:35:29,21 --> 0:35:31,74
as a way to let go of stress.


881
0:35:31,74 --> 0:35:34,4
And man's way to
let go stress is


882
0:35:34,4 --> 0:35:37,33
to detach, to separate
from his emotions.


883
0:35:37,33 --> 0:35:39,7
And you can see
this in brain scans.


884
0:35:39,7 --> 0:35:41,811
The amygdala in
a man is wired up


885
0:35:41,811 --> 0:35:44,6
to go right to the part of
the brain-- fight or flight


886
0:35:44,6 --> 0:35:47,7
is the amygdala-- into
solving the problem.


887
0:35:47,7 --> 0:35:48,94
You know what Freud
did-- it totally


888
0:35:48,94 --> 0:35:51,79
different from modern therapy.


889
0:35:51,79 --> 0:35:55,7
90% of the people who see
modern therapists are women.


890
0:35:55,7 --> 0:35:56,33
Why?


891
0:35:56,33 --> 0:35:57,99
It's changed.


892
0:35:57,99 --> 0:35:59,4
It's eye contact.


893
0:35:59,4 --> 0:36:0,42
It's how do you feel?


894
0:36:0,42 --> 0:36:1,57
How do you feel?


895
0:36:1,57 --> 0:36:2,499
What else do you feel?


896
0:36:2,499 --> 0:36:3,29
What else happened?


897
0:36:3,29 --> 0:36:4,57
How does that make you feel?


898
0:36:4,57 --> 0:36:8,26
It's all this personal
nurturing interaction.


899
0:36:8,26 --> 0:36:9,32
Freud did none of that.


900
0:36:9,32 --> 0:36:11,17
He had mostly men.


901
0:36:11,17 --> 0:36:13,58
You go into a dark room
where you had no eye contact.


902
0:36:13,58 --> 0:36:16,346
You lie down on a couch,
which every man loves to do.


903
0:36:16,346 --> 0:36:21,7
He'd sit behind you, and all
he would do is take notes.


904
0:36:21,7 --> 0:36:23,67
He'd ask you questions.


905
0:36:23,67 --> 0:36:24,88
And you would solve problems.


906
0:36:24,88 --> 0:36:25,84
Why do you think this?


907
0:36:25,84 --> 0:36:26,92
And why you think that?


908
0:36:26,92 --> 0:36:28,36
And why do you think this?


909
0:36:28,36 --> 0:36:32,552
He could have just been saying,
and what is 23 times 17?


910
0:36:32,552 --> 0:36:34,51
And you would have to
calculate these problems.


911
0:36:34,51 --> 0:36:39,72
Just solving problems and
relaxing lowers a man's stress.


912
0:36:39,72 --> 0:36:41,67
It wasn't some
big, magical thing.


913
0:36:41,67 --> 0:36:43,64
But for women, it did nothing.


914
0:36:43,64 --> 0:36:45,27
So, gradually, it
evolved for women.


915
0:36:45,27 --> 0:36:47,9
And usually it was
just very wealthy men


916
0:36:47,9 --> 0:36:50,32
they did therapy, because
once you're a man,


917
0:36:50,32 --> 0:36:53,78
and you have lots of
wealth, you go crazy.


918
0:36:53,78 --> 0:36:55,28
Why?


919
0:36:55,28 --> 0:36:57,81
And by crazy, I mean, look
at the "National Enquirer"


920
0:36:57,81 --> 0:37:0,446
and see all the wealthy
superstar people.


921
0:37:0,446 --> 0:37:1,195
They get divorced.


922
0:37:1,195 --> 0:37:2,39
They have battles.


923
0:37:2,39 --> 0:37:3,324
They take drugs.


924
0:37:3,324 --> 0:37:4,49
They're going through rehab.


925
0:37:4,49 --> 0:37:8,7
What's going on is that they
don't have to work anymore.


926
0:37:8,7 --> 0:37:11,16
These are men who
don't have to work,


927
0:37:11,16 --> 0:37:14,13
so they get to do
what they like to do.


928
0:37:14,13 --> 0:37:18,13
When you do what you like to
do, oxytocin gets produced.


929
0:37:18,13 --> 0:37:21,3
Oxytocin doesn't
lower stress in men.


930
0:37:21,3 --> 0:37:23,49
Doing anything that
women like to do


931
0:37:23,49 --> 0:37:26,28
does not lower stress in men.


932
0:37:26,28 --> 0:37:27,78
That's why in the
beginning, men are


933
0:37:27,78 --> 0:37:29,472
so happy to do things with you.


934
0:37:29,472 --> 0:37:31,68
And after a while, they're
ready to sit on the couch.


935
0:37:31,68 --> 0:37:33,36
And what you'll say
to them things like,


936
0:37:33,36 --> 0:37:34,965
hey, what would you like to do?


937
0:37:34,965 --> 0:37:37,34
He'll say, I'd like to just
sit here and have you make me


938
0:37:37,34 --> 0:37:38,84
dinner.


939
0:37:38,84 --> 0:37:42,25
Or you might want to go
out to dinner tonight,


940
0:37:42,25 --> 0:37:44,76
and you say to him,
hey, John, would you


941
0:37:44,76 --> 0:37:45,45
like to go out to
dinner tonight?


942
0:37:45,45 --> 0:37:48,19
And what does every woman
interpret that to mean?


943
0:37:48,19 --> 0:37:50,54
What she's really
saying is, I'd like


944
0:37:50,54 --> 0:37:51,22
to go out to dinner tonight.


945
0:37:51,22 --> 0:37:52,52
Wouldn't you like
to go out to dinner?


946
0:37:52,52 --> 0:37:53,811
Let's go out to dinner tonight.


947
0:37:53,811 --> 0:37:55,33
But she doesn't say that.


948
0:37:55,33 --> 0:37:57,44
She says, hey,
John, would you like


949
0:37:57,44 --> 0:37:59,24
to go out to dinner tonight?


950
0:37:59,24 --> 0:38:2,31
If he's not initiated into
the Venusian language-- which


951
0:38:2,31 --> 0:38:4,56
is very convoluted and
changing all the time,


952
0:38:4,56 --> 0:38:7,26
depending on her
mood-- would you


953
0:38:7,26 --> 0:38:8,4
like to go out to
dinner tonight?


954
0:38:8,4 --> 0:38:10,27
No, I'd rather just stay home.


955
0:38:10,27 --> 0:38:12,4
You could make me this dinner.


956
0:38:12,4 --> 0:38:14,33
Because he actually
thinks you're


957
0:38:14,33 --> 0:38:15,865
asking what he'd like to do.


958
0:38:15,865 --> 0:38:21,31



959
0:38:21,31 --> 0:38:25,272
The flip side of this is
Friday night comes along.


960
0:38:25,272 --> 0:38:27,48
And this is where we have
this experiment of romance.


961
0:38:27,48 --> 0:38:30,9
Marriage is based upon love
and affection and romance,


962
0:38:30,9 --> 0:38:32,3
which is magnificent.


963
0:38:32,3 --> 0:38:34,16
I've been married
to my wife 28 years.


964
0:38:34,16 --> 0:38:39,61
To experience passion with
somebody that you know,


965
0:38:39,61 --> 0:38:41,522
it's like a
miraculous experience.


966
0:38:41,522 --> 0:38:43,23
Very few people have
ever experienced it.


967
0:38:43,23 --> 0:38:45,635
They have to have somebody
new, somebody different.


968
0:38:45,635 --> 0:38:49,512
To actually experience passion
with somebody you know.


969
0:38:49,512 --> 0:38:51,22
It was like seven
years into our marriage


970
0:38:51,22 --> 0:38:54,35
is when I woke up to
how great my life was.


971
0:38:54,35 --> 0:38:55,68
Not that I wasn't
having a good time,


972
0:38:55,68 --> 0:39:0,57
but making love with my
wife, it was fireworks.


973
0:39:0,57 --> 0:39:1,42
It was spectacular.


974
0:39:1,42 --> 0:39:3,378
It was one of those times
where, afterward, you


975
0:39:3,378 --> 0:39:5,98
just laugh at how
fantastic it was.


976
0:39:5,98 --> 0:39:9,1
And I said to her,
wow, that was as good


977
0:39:9,1 --> 0:39:10,94
as it was in the beginning.


978
0:39:10,94 --> 0:39:12,94
And she goes, oh,
that was better.


979
0:39:12,94 --> 0:39:14,58
I said, what do you mean?


980
0:39:14,58 --> 0:39:16,85
She says, well, in the
beginning, the sex was great,


981
0:39:16,85 --> 0:39:19,66
but you didn't really know me.


982
0:39:19,66 --> 0:39:22,25
Now, you've seen the
best of me, and you've


983
0:39:22,25 --> 0:39:26,47
seen the worst of me, and
you still love and adore me.


984
0:39:26,47 --> 0:39:28,7
That's real love.


985
0:39:28,7 --> 0:39:29,981
That's real love.


986
0:39:29,981 --> 0:39:32,23
In the beginning, its a
glimpse of what it feels like.


987
0:39:32,23 --> 0:39:33,57
It's the brain
chemicals of love.


988
0:39:33,57 --> 0:39:35,528
But you don't even know
who you're reacting to.


989
0:39:35,528 --> 0:39:36,88
It's mostly fantasy.


990
0:39:36,88 --> 0:39:38,54
In order to keep
your heart open,


991
0:39:38,54 --> 0:39:42,392
we need to have these advanced
communication insights.


992
0:39:42,392 --> 0:39:43,35
Because what do you do?


993
0:39:43,35 --> 0:39:45,57
If a guy needs to
go to his cave--


994
0:39:45,57 --> 0:39:47,57
one of the big insights
of "Men Are from Mars"--


995
0:39:47,57 --> 0:39:49,74
now it's pretty much
gone into the culture.


996
0:39:49,74 --> 0:39:51,11
Man cave.


997
0:39:51,11 --> 0:39:52,83
He needs his man cave.


998
0:39:52,83 --> 0:39:58,19
He goes to his man cave, except
men typically don't come out.


999
0:39:58,19 --> 0:40:0,914
So I teach women how to bring
him out of the man cave.


1000
0:40:0,914 --> 0:40:2,33
He's got to have
that, but he also


1001
0:40:2,33 --> 0:40:4,464
needs a little
incentive to come out.


1002
0:40:4,464 --> 0:40:6,88
If you say to him, what would
you like for dinner tonight,


1003
0:40:6,88 --> 0:40:8,2
or what would you like to do?


1004
0:40:8,2 --> 0:40:9,436
He'll say, just
sit in my man cave


1005
0:40:9,436 --> 0:40:12,4
and continue doing what I'm
doing, as opposed to you


1006
0:40:12,4 --> 0:40:14,49
have to know what you'd
like, what you want,


1007
0:40:14,49 --> 0:40:16,16
learning how to ask for support.


1008
0:40:16,16 --> 0:40:17,64
These are all like new skills.


1009
0:40:17,64 --> 0:40:20,6
Women have never had
to do that in the past.


1010
0:40:20,6 --> 0:40:22,18
And for thousands and
thousands of years


1011
0:40:22,18 --> 0:40:24,57
in indigenous cultures, women
don't ask men for anything.


1012
0:40:24,57 --> 0:40:26,87
They don't even talk to men.


1013
0:40:26,87 --> 0:40:29,55
Men learned a man's
role from his father.


1014
0:40:29,55 --> 0:40:30,97
Women learned to do from mother.


1015
0:40:30,97 --> 0:40:32,16
That was it.


1016
0:40:32,16 --> 0:40:35,66
There's very little
connection and communication.


1017
0:40:35,66 --> 0:40:39,9
So it's learning to take
the time that we need.


1018
0:40:39,9 --> 0:40:41,44
And for men, it's
often alone time,


1019
0:40:41,44 --> 0:40:43,65
and for women, it's
connection time.


1020
0:40:43,65 --> 0:40:46,3
If you want to keep the
connection open with a man,


1021
0:40:46,3 --> 0:40:48,18
and you want to keep
him connected to you,


1022
0:40:48,18 --> 0:40:51,81
your role is to, in a
sense, draw him out.


1023
0:40:51,81 --> 0:40:54,3
And one of the best
metaphors for this


1024
0:40:54,3 --> 0:40:57,54
is when I was going to
places in indigenous India.


1025
0:40:57,54 --> 0:41:0,849
You go to these temples that
are 5,000-year-old temple,


1026
0:41:0,849 --> 0:41:2,39
and you'll see all
around the temple,


1027
0:41:2,39 --> 0:41:5,515
men are sitting in meditation,
not the women at the spa.


1028
0:41:5,515 --> 0:41:7,64
Men are all sitting in
meditation, because they can


1029
0:41:7,64 --> 0:41:9,53
more quickly--
it's not automatic,


1030
0:41:9,53 --> 0:41:12,29
but a man has the ability
to shut the world out,


1031
0:41:12,29 --> 0:41:14,11
and that is the most
powerful way for him


1032
0:41:14,11 --> 0:41:17,41
to rebuild his testosterone
and regenerate his body.


1033
0:41:17,41 --> 0:41:19,607
So men are all
meditating at the temple,


1034
0:41:19,607 --> 0:41:21,94
and women are all dancing
around naked with little bells


1035
0:41:21,94 --> 0:41:23,36
in their waist.


1036
0:41:23,36 --> 0:41:24,28
And their job?


1037
0:41:24,28 --> 0:41:26,49
To get men out of meditation.


1038
0:41:26,49 --> 0:41:28,48
You're supposed to draw
us out of the cave.


1039
0:41:28,48 --> 0:41:32,4
Their whole mythology
is Shiva would meditate


1040
0:41:32,4 --> 0:41:34,58
10,000 years or a million
years or whatever,


1041
0:41:34,58 --> 0:41:37,34
and his wife has to dance
around him until finally they


1042
0:41:37,34 --> 0:41:39,4
make love and create the world.


1043
0:41:39,4 --> 0:41:41,75
But it's the woman
that draws the man out.


1044
0:41:41,75 --> 0:41:45,174
And women today, they don't even
care about drawing the man out.


1045
0:41:45,174 --> 0:41:46,84
They just like going
on with their life,


1046
0:41:46,84 --> 0:41:49,71
and then they misinterpret
he's sitting in his cave.


1047
0:41:49,71 --> 0:41:52,186
What you start to think is,
well, he doesn't love me.


1048
0:41:52,186 --> 0:41:54,88
He didn't used to go
to the cave before.


1049
0:41:54,88 --> 0:41:57,32
And that's because he had the
newness in the relationship


1050
0:41:57,32 --> 0:42:0,9
that would produce huge
amounts of dopamine,


1051
0:42:0,9 --> 0:42:1,86
and then that
produces testosterone,


1052
0:42:1,86 --> 0:42:4,91
so he wasn't needing
to rebuild it as much.


1053
0:42:4,91 --> 0:42:6,62
So now you're in
the relationship.


1054
0:42:6,62 --> 0:42:8,23
He's taking more time away.


1055
0:42:8,23 --> 0:42:10,19
He doesn't have that
same attraction to you


1056
0:42:10,19 --> 0:42:10,83
he had before.


1057
0:42:10,83 --> 0:42:12,1
He's starting to pull away.


1058
0:42:12,1 --> 0:42:13,87
And women go, oh, I
have to get it back.


1059
0:42:13,87 --> 0:42:14,93
I have to get back.


1060
0:42:14,93 --> 0:42:19,542
And you run after him,
and he runs away more.


1061
0:42:19,542 --> 0:42:21,75
That was one of the big
themes in "Men Are from Mars,


1062
0:42:21,75 --> 0:42:26,71
Women Are from Venus" is
men are like rubber bands.


1063
0:42:26,71 --> 0:42:30,89
They want to get close to
you, and then they pull out.


1064
0:42:30,89 --> 0:42:35,8
When they pull out, like a
rubber band, they stretch.


1065
0:42:35,8 --> 0:42:38,23
And when it reaches its length
of how much space do I need,


1066
0:42:38,23 --> 0:42:42,46
then he springs back, and he
falls in love with you again.


1067
0:42:42,46 --> 0:42:45,18
And then he pulls
away-- he misses you--


1068
0:42:45,18 --> 0:42:47,11
and he springs back.


1069
0:42:47,11 --> 0:42:50,74
Now, I'm going to go on
a trip to China next week


1070
0:42:50,74 --> 0:42:52,38
or so for three weeks.


1071
0:42:52,38 --> 0:42:56,28
I haven't been away from my wife
in eight years for three weeks.


1072
0:42:56,28 --> 0:42:59,15
But what I know is I'll
have the best sex of my life


1073
0:42:59,15 --> 0:43:0,791
when I come home.


1074
0:43:0,791 --> 0:43:2,79
That other time I was on
a tour for three weeks,


1075
0:43:2,79 --> 0:43:5,32
and it was the best
sex of my life then.


1076
0:43:5,32 --> 0:43:5,89
Why?


1077
0:43:5,89 --> 0:43:8,7
Because I have pulled back.


1078
0:43:8,7 --> 0:43:10,22
And when I pull back, I
have a chance to miss her.


1079
0:43:10,22 --> 0:43:12,45
I have a chance to
rebuild my focus on her.


1080
0:43:12,45 --> 0:43:15,15
I have a chance for my
testosterone levels to rise.


1081
0:43:15,15 --> 0:43:18,481
And when I come back, it
will just be super stud land.


1082
0:43:18,481 --> 0:43:20,23
I'm really looking
forward to it much more


1083
0:43:20,23 --> 0:43:24,1
than how much I'm getting
paid, which is a lot as well.


1084
0:43:24,1 --> 0:43:26,0
But that is really
an exciting thing.


1085
0:43:26,0 --> 0:43:29,9
So when men pull away, they
spring back like a rubber band.


1086
0:43:29,9 --> 0:43:35,72
And then once they're in,
the rubber band gets soft.


1087
0:43:35,72 --> 0:43:37,13
It's just a metaphor for sex.


1088
0:43:37,13 --> 0:43:40,11
Imagine a man just
went in and stayed.


1089
0:43:40,11 --> 0:43:42,12
You'd be wanting
to push him away.


1090
0:43:42,12 --> 0:43:42,99
He pulls out.


1091
0:43:42,99 --> 0:43:43,63
He goes in.


1092
0:43:43,63 --> 0:43:44,3
He pulls out.


1093
0:43:44,3 --> 0:43:44,87
He goes in.


1094
0:43:44,87 --> 0:43:47,24
It's that dance of coming
closer, pulling apart.


1095
0:43:47,24 --> 0:43:49,53
And that's his role to
go in and pull back.


1096
0:43:49,53 --> 0:43:51,4
He has the hormones for it.


1097
0:43:51,4 --> 0:43:54,35
Testosterone is the
in and out urge.


1098
0:43:54,35 --> 0:43:56,49
This is testosterone.


1099
0:43:56,49 --> 0:43:58,8
When women don't understand
the hormonal differences


1100
0:43:58,8 --> 0:44:3,52
between men, when he pulls
away, what do you do?


1101
0:44:3,52 --> 0:44:5,51
You run after him.


1102
0:44:5,51 --> 0:44:7,36
And so if you're
running after him,


1103
0:44:7,36 --> 0:44:9,442
does that rubber band
ever get to stretch?


1104
0:44:9,442 --> 0:44:10,65
And how do you run after him?


1105
0:44:10,65 --> 0:44:13,4
I go into all the details
in the books, but you say,


1106
0:44:13,4 --> 0:44:14,9
what's the matter?


1107
0:44:14,9 --> 0:44:16,4
Is there something wrong?


1108
0:44:16,4 --> 0:44:17,9
Or let me do something for you.


1109
0:44:17,9 --> 0:44:19,67
Or let's do this together.


1110
0:44:19,67 --> 0:44:21,33
Or what would you like to do?


1111
0:44:21,33 --> 0:44:23,982
And now you're
concerned about him.


1112
0:44:23,982 --> 0:44:25,44
When he pulls away,
that's when you


1113
0:44:25,44 --> 0:44:28,98
have to come back to being
self-sufficient, self-reliant.


1114
0:44:28,98 --> 0:44:33,4
I have a life, and you're
lucky to be part of it.


1115
0:44:33,4 --> 0:44:35,99
If you can stand in your
place without getting insecure


1116
0:44:35,99 --> 0:44:38,11
and running after
him, that causes


1117
0:44:38,11 --> 0:44:39,56
him to want to come back.


1118
0:44:39,56 --> 0:44:43,67
Because, see, men really
need women to be happier.


1119
0:44:43,67 --> 0:44:47,1
We can only get to a
certain level of happiness.


1120
0:44:47,1 --> 0:44:49,84
Then we have to be able to
make a woman happy to take us


1121
0:44:49,84 --> 0:44:51,44
to a higher level.


1122
0:44:51,44 --> 0:44:53,24
The illusion we
all have as men--


1123
0:44:53,24 --> 0:44:55,38
we get caught in this
trap-- is that we


1124
0:44:55,38 --> 0:44:57,18
think we can make her happy.


1125
0:44:57,18 --> 0:44:59,88
You can't make a woman happy.


1126
0:44:59,88 --> 0:45:3,24
You can only make
a woman happier.


1127
0:45:3,24 --> 0:45:5,99
You're not responsible
for her happiness.


1128
0:45:5,99 --> 0:45:7,82
Because in the beginning,
all that newness


1129
0:45:7,82 --> 0:45:9,53
stimulates huge
amounts of dopamine,


1130
0:45:9,53 --> 0:45:12,6
just like winning the
lottery, just like superhero.


1131
0:45:12,6 --> 0:45:14,86
That's why they
call heroin, heroin.


1132
0:45:14,86 --> 0:45:17,23
You get to be a hero and
sit down and do nothing.


1133
0:45:17,23 --> 0:45:18,89
It makes you feel like a hero.


1134
0:45:18,89 --> 0:45:22,17
A woman makes you feel like a
hero, makes you feel fantastic.


1135
0:45:22,17 --> 0:45:23,98
Look what I did.


1136
0:45:23,98 --> 0:45:25,0
She's so happy.


1137
0:45:25,0 --> 0:45:26,56
The problem is,
when you take credit


1138
0:45:26,56 --> 0:45:28,74
for all of her happiness,
when she's not happy,


1139
0:45:28,74 --> 0:45:30,33
look what you feel.


1140
0:45:30,33 --> 0:45:31,65
You feel like you've failed.


1141
0:45:31,65 --> 0:45:32,83
You shut down.


1142
0:45:32,83 --> 0:45:34,11
You get bent out of shape.


1143
0:45:34,11 --> 0:45:35,22
You get pouty.


1144
0:45:35,22 --> 0:45:37,486
You get feminine.


1145
0:45:37,486 --> 0:45:39,1
See, what people
don't understand


1146
0:45:39,1 --> 0:45:40,84
is this feminization
of men is when


1147
0:45:40,84 --> 0:45:44,24
men become all
negative emotions.


1148
0:45:44,24 --> 0:45:45,64
If you're in your
masculine side,


1149
0:45:45,64 --> 0:45:50,59
you have healthy testosterone,
you don't get afraid.


1150
0:45:50,59 --> 0:45:52,8
You don't get angry.


1151
0:45:52,8 --> 0:45:54,74
You don't cry unless the
problem is really big,


1152
0:45:54,74 --> 0:45:58,27
and there's nothing you can do
about it, like grieving a loss.


1153
0:45:58,27 --> 0:46:2,27
There's places for feelings
but not in arguments.


1154
0:46:2,27 --> 0:46:4,97
Men used to be taught
this stuff, how


1155
0:46:4,97 --> 0:46:7,34
to endure pain without
talking about it.


1156
0:46:7,34 --> 0:46:10,19
In initiation for
an American Indian,


1157
0:46:10,19 --> 0:46:12,1
they'd stick sticks
through the breast


1158
0:46:12,1 --> 0:46:14,5
in front of the whole
village at 13 years old.


1159
0:46:14,5 --> 0:46:17,68
They'd tie ropes to it
and slowly raise you.


1160
0:46:17,68 --> 0:46:20,876
Throw the rope over a limb,
slowly raise you in the air,


1161
0:46:20,876 --> 0:46:23,43
and you hang there
the whole day.


1162
0:46:23,43 --> 0:46:25,99
And you're not
allowed to cry out.


1163
0:46:25,99 --> 0:46:27,93
You have to learn to
deal with that pain.


1164
0:46:27,93 --> 0:46:30,56
You have to contain
it inside yourself.


1165
0:46:30,56 --> 0:46:32,6
And now do we need
these initiations today?


1166
0:46:32,6 --> 0:46:33,1
No.


1167
0:46:33,1 --> 0:46:34,81
We have a more
advanced initiation.


1168
0:46:34,81 --> 0:46:37,24
Try listening to your wife
without saying anything


1169
0:46:37,24 --> 0:46:39,23
for 10 minutes.


1170
0:46:39,23 --> 0:46:41,58
Without reacting back.


1171
0:46:41,58 --> 0:46:43,0
See, you have to
learn as men how


1172
0:46:43,0 --> 0:46:45,12
to contain the
female side of you


1173
0:46:45,12 --> 0:46:47,79
inside and not become
a female and start


1174
0:46:47,79 --> 0:46:50,14
whining and complaining back.


1175
0:46:50,14 --> 0:46:51,98
This destroys marriages.


1176
0:46:51,98 --> 0:46:53,72
A woman will complain.


1177
0:46:53,72 --> 0:46:55,8
A man has 10 more back.


1178
0:46:55,8 --> 0:46:56,14
He says, I can beat that.


1179
0:46:56,14 --> 0:46:56,639
I'm a man.


1180
0:46:56,639 --> 0:46:57,63
I got testosterone.


1181
0:46:57,63 --> 0:46:59,16
I can do more.


1182
0:46:59,16 --> 0:47:1,24
And now you get this little
tit for tat argument.


1183
0:47:1,24 --> 0:47:2,38
Nobody's taught men today.


1184
0:47:2,38 --> 0:47:3,13
You don't do that.


1185
0:47:3,13 --> 0:47:4,67
That's not what men do.


1186
0:47:4,67 --> 0:47:6,71
What women need most
is to feel heard,


1187
0:47:6,71 --> 0:47:9,6
and then a magic trick happens.


1188
0:47:9,6 --> 0:47:12,18
She feels better, and
nothing has changed.


1189
0:47:12,18 --> 0:47:13,42
This is like a revelation.


1190
0:47:13,42 --> 0:47:15,78
I have women coming into
my office so unhappy,


1191
0:47:15,78 --> 0:47:17,364
and when they leave,
they're so happy.


1192
0:47:17,364 --> 0:47:18,78
And after a while,
I point out, do


1193
0:47:18,78 --> 0:47:20,8
you realize that you come
to my office unhappy,


1194
0:47:20,8 --> 0:47:24,206
and you leave happy,
and nothing has changed?


1195
0:47:24,206 --> 0:47:25,58
Nothing has changed
in your life.


1196
0:47:25,58 --> 0:47:28,78
It's all inside ourselves
how we look at the world.


1197
0:47:28,78 --> 0:47:31,75
As a couple, men can learn
how to support a woman.


1198
0:47:31,75 --> 0:47:34,71
Women can learn how to
receive that support.


1199
0:47:34,71 --> 0:47:36,86
That's the whole new
dance, is women learning,


1200
0:47:36,86 --> 0:47:39,79
how do I motivate him to
give me the support I need?


1201
0:47:39,79 --> 0:47:42,42
Because he wants to do it,
but it's very hard to start.


1202
0:47:42,42 --> 0:47:45,42
When he goes to his
cave, you misinterpret,


1203
0:47:45,42 --> 0:47:47,77
thinking, he must not love me.


1204
0:47:47,77 --> 0:47:49,46
So how can you go
and ask for support


1205
0:47:49,46 --> 0:47:51,35
to somebody you think
doesn't love you?


1206
0:47:51,35 --> 0:47:53,27
Or ask for help
around the house?


1207
0:47:53,27 --> 0:47:54,81
Women need way more help.


1208
0:47:54,81 --> 0:47:55,64
How can you ask?


1209
0:47:55,64 --> 0:47:57,32
You look at him with
eyes of resentment.


1210
0:47:57,32 --> 0:47:58,111
Aren't you helping?


1211
0:47:58,111 --> 0:47:59,65
Aren't you joining in?


1212
0:47:59,65 --> 0:48:0,695
Why aren't you helping me?


1213
0:48:0,695 --> 0:48:2,12
Well, he needs a
job description,


1214
0:48:2,12 --> 0:48:4,57
and he needs to be paid.


1215
0:48:4,57 --> 0:48:6,271
Paid is your happiness.


1216
0:48:6,271 --> 0:48:8,2
So let's say you need
him to do something.


1217
0:48:8,2 --> 0:48:9,6
Would you move that box?


1218
0:48:9,6 --> 0:48:11,7
And it's the third
time you've asked him.


1219
0:48:11,7 --> 0:48:13,7
He moves the box,
and you glare at him,


1220
0:48:13,7 --> 0:48:14,72
like, finally you did it.


1221
0:48:14,72 --> 0:48:16,95
As opposed to, oh,
you moved the box.


1222
0:48:16,95 --> 0:48:21,23
Then, next, you're training
him to do little things


1223
0:48:21,23 --> 0:48:22,6
to make you happy.


1224
0:48:22,6 --> 0:48:24,54
Because in a man's
mind, big things


1225
0:48:24,54 --> 0:48:27,17
make you happy,
not little things.


1226
0:48:27,17 --> 0:48:27,96
He's dating you.


1227
0:48:27,96 --> 0:48:29,24
He's only doing little stuff.


1228
0:48:29,24 --> 0:48:31,78
And he figures if little
stuff makes you happy,


1229
0:48:31,78 --> 0:48:34,41
wait until I do the big
stuff like commitment,


1230
0:48:34,41 --> 0:48:37,43
and marriage, or
sharing my income.


1231
0:48:37,43 --> 0:48:38,81
That's the big stuff.


1232
0:48:38,81 --> 0:48:41,17
Then I don't need to
do the little stuff.


1233
0:48:41,17 --> 0:48:42,81
But it's the little
stuff that actually


1234
0:48:42,81 --> 0:48:44,85
generates the oxytocin.


1235
0:48:44,85 --> 0:48:47,52
So if I give one
rose to a woman,


1236
0:48:47,52 --> 0:48:50,2
she gets a surge of oxytocin.


1237
0:48:50,2 --> 0:48:53,43
If I give her 24 roses, in
my mind, that's at least 24


1238
0:48:53,43 --> 0:48:55,31
surges, right?


1239
0:48:55,31 --> 0:48:55,53
No.


1240
0:48:55,53 --> 0:48:57,17
It's just the same surge.


1241
0:48:57,17 --> 0:48:59,91
So think of it in
terms of points.


1242
0:48:59,91 --> 0:49:2,89
In a man's mind, I'm giving
her 24 roses, 36 roses.


1243
0:49:2,89 --> 0:49:3,95
That 36 points.


1244
0:49:3,95 --> 0:49:6,91
That should last
me half the year.


1245
0:49:6,91 --> 0:49:8,36
It's one point.


1246
0:49:8,36 --> 0:49:10,49
And why are roses so
symbolic of romance?


1247
0:49:10,49 --> 0:49:12,446
Because they die in a week.


1248
0:49:12,446 --> 0:49:13,695
You have to keep nurturing it.


1249
0:49:13,695 --> 0:49:16,4
You have to keep nurturing it.


1250
0:49:16,4 --> 0:49:18,5
So once men
understand this stuff,


1251
0:49:18,5 --> 0:49:19,4
women are not so complicated.


1252
0:49:19,4 --> 0:49:21,3
It's easier to make
the relationship work.


1253
0:49:21,3 --> 0:49:23,2
But it is an art.


1254
0:49:23,2 --> 0:49:26,3
It is like learning
a new program.


1255
0:49:26,3 --> 0:49:26,94
It's a new system.


1256
0:49:26,94 --> 0:49:29,66
And once you learn the new
system, it's really easy.


1257
0:49:29,66 --> 0:49:31,36
But when you turn
over to a new system,


1258
0:49:31,36 --> 0:49:32,66
it's really hard for a while.


1259
0:49:32,66 --> 0:49:34,24
That's what we're going
through right now.


1260
0:49:34,24 --> 0:49:36,23
So we have about 10 minutes
for questions and answers.


1261
0:49:36,23 --> 0:49:37,313
I see one right over here.


1262
0:49:37,313 --> 0:49:38,15
Go right ahead.


1263
0:49:38,15 --> 0:49:39,497
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?


1264
0:49:39,497 --> 0:49:40,8
JOHN GRAY: OK.


1265
0:49:40,8 --> 0:49:42,8
So you'd like to know how women
sabotage communication at work?


1266
0:49:42,8 --> 0:49:44,56
Because that is probably
one of the things


1267
0:49:44,56 --> 0:49:48,529
that I write about
in "Work with Me."


1268
0:49:48,529 --> 0:49:50,32
I have 10 minutes to
talk, so I'll give you


1269
0:49:50,32 --> 0:49:53,91
one way women sabotage
communication at work


1270
0:49:53,91 --> 0:49:59,41
is they simply use the phrase,
Bob, could you do this for me?


1271
0:49:59,41 --> 0:50:3,55
And Bob will say, sure,
and then forget to do it.


1272
0:50:3,55 --> 0:50:5,68
And you'll think,
how could he forget?


1273
0:50:5,68 --> 0:50:9,44
And this is something you
experiment with this week.


1274
0:50:9,44 --> 0:50:11,8
Instead of using,
could you do this?


1275
0:50:11,8 --> 0:50:11,9
Can you do this?


1276
0:50:11,9 --> 0:50:15,56
Say, Bob, would
you do this for me?


1277
0:50:15,56 --> 0:50:17,33
And you'll see he will
remember to do it.


1278
0:50:17,33 --> 0:50:18,38
It's linguistics.


1279
0:50:18,38 --> 0:50:22,94
If you say would, a man
feels he's making a promise.


1280
0:50:22,94 --> 0:50:23,26
If you say, could you do it?


1281
0:50:23,26 --> 0:50:24,1
Yeah, I could do it.


1282
0:50:24,1 --> 0:50:26,266
It doesn't even go into the
front part of his brain.


1283
0:50:26,266 --> 0:50:28,82
It literally doesn't go there.


1284
0:50:28,82 --> 0:50:33,8
The next one, another way is not
giving enough feedback to a man


1285
0:50:33,8 --> 0:50:34,77
that you value him.


1286
0:50:34,77 --> 0:50:38,27
Because women just assume that
if you're interacting with him,


1287
0:50:38,27 --> 0:50:39,33
he must feel valued.


1288
0:50:39,33 --> 0:50:41,96
So one of the ways a woman
can communicate value to man,


1289
0:50:41,96 --> 0:50:44,2
that you value
him-- three phrases.


1290
0:50:44,2 --> 0:50:45,88
You start doing this
this week, you'll


1291
0:50:45,88 --> 0:50:48,429
see a huge difference in
the men you work with.


1292
0:50:48,429 --> 0:50:48,97
He's talking.


1293
0:50:48,97 --> 0:50:52,57
When he pauses, say,
that makes sense.


1294
0:50:52,57 --> 0:50:55,32
And just brighten up,
like, that makes sense.


1295
0:50:55,32 --> 0:50:55,82
You'll see.


1296
0:50:55,82 --> 0:50:56,88
He'll take a double take.


1297
0:50:56,88 --> 0:50:57,73
What did I say?


1298
0:50:57,73 --> 0:50:59,23
Somebody acknowledged
I make sense.


1299
0:50:59,23 --> 0:51:0,39
That makes sense.


1300
0:51:0,39 --> 0:51:4,3
Another one is, with a little
female enthusiasm, good idea.


1301
0:51:4,3 --> 0:51:6,25
You'll see his
mood will changed.


1302
0:51:6,25 --> 0:51:9,4
And at least a couple times
a week, go, brilliant.


1303
0:51:9,4 --> 0:51:10,35
He says, yes, yes.


1304
0:51:10,35 --> 0:51:12,91
What else can I do for you?


1305
0:51:12,91 --> 0:51:15,36
Now, I know the flip side of
this-- how do men sabotage?


1306
0:51:15,36 --> 0:51:17,13
Well, I'll do a
couple on men, which


1307
0:51:17,13 --> 0:51:19,65
is how men could sabotage
relationships in the workplace.


1308
0:51:19,65 --> 0:51:22,13
Same thing at home, which
is, ask more questions.


1309
0:51:22,13 --> 0:51:24,75
Whenever you think you're ready
to give a solution or a point


1310
0:51:24,75 --> 0:51:26,79
of view, ask another question.


1311
0:51:26,79 --> 0:51:29,98
If you show interest in
a woman's point of view,


1312
0:51:29,98 --> 0:51:32,11
you start building
a bond of trust,


1313
0:51:32,11 --> 0:51:33,91
as opposed to just
being interested


1314
0:51:33,91 --> 0:51:35,41
in solving the problem.


1315
0:51:35,41 --> 0:51:38,7
Men are just interested
in solving the problem.


1316
0:51:38,7 --> 0:51:40,28
But if you can just
ask another question,


1317
0:51:40,28 --> 0:51:43,72
it take your interest
into her point of view


1318
0:51:43,72 --> 0:51:45,87
if a man can ask
that extra question.


1319
0:51:45,87 --> 0:51:48,42
Here is the next one, as a
male manager, particularly,


1320
0:51:48,42 --> 0:51:50,23
but working on a
team with women.


1321
0:51:50,23 --> 0:51:53,52
When there's a problem, and a
woman's presenting the problem,


1322
0:51:53,52 --> 0:51:56,67
don't immediately give what
you think is the answer.


1323
0:51:56,67 --> 0:52:0,11
Instead, pause, and
say to her, and what


1324
0:52:0,11 --> 0:52:2,49
do you think we
should do about this?


1325
0:52:2,49 --> 0:52:4,31
And listen to her answer.


1326
0:52:4,31 --> 0:52:6,15
Because so much of
the time, men just--


1327
0:52:6,15 --> 0:52:8,81
if you talk about a
problem, men jump in there


1328
0:52:8,81 --> 0:52:10,72
with 30 times more
testosterone, which


1329
0:52:10,72 --> 0:52:12,2
gives you faster reaction time.


1330
0:52:12,2 --> 0:52:13,33
I got the answer!


1331
0:52:13,33 --> 0:52:14,87
I'll solve that problem.


1332
0:52:14,87 --> 0:52:17,41
And he doesn't realize that
you have the answer, too.


1333
0:52:17,41 --> 0:52:20,22
So you're sabotaging
your success


1334
0:52:20,22 --> 0:52:22,29
by not letting him know
you have an answer-- that


1335
0:52:22,29 --> 0:52:24,85
would be another topic on
how women sabotage-- but men


1336
0:52:24,85 --> 0:52:28,47
sabotage building trust
and a sense of cooperation


1337
0:52:28,47 --> 0:52:31,43
when they're working with women
by jumping in with solutions,


1338
0:52:31,43 --> 0:52:34,1
rather than asking a
few questions first.


1339
0:52:34,1 --> 0:52:36,72
But, for men, it's like
playing basketball.


1340
0:52:36,72 --> 0:52:39,194
I want to grab the ball
and dunk it myself.


1341
0:52:39,194 --> 0:52:40,61
Women are all, on
a certain level,


1342
0:52:40,61 --> 0:52:42,71
let's all take turns, and
let's all take credit together.


1343
0:52:42,71 --> 0:52:43,36
We're a team.


1344
0:52:43,36 --> 0:52:45,0
We did it all ourselves.


1345
0:52:45,0 --> 0:52:47,16
And a man's over
here, but I did this.


1346
0:52:47,16 --> 0:52:48,26
Anyway, a lot on that.


1347
0:52:48,26 --> 0:52:50,32
That's from the
book "Work with Me."


1348
0:52:50,32 --> 0:52:51,49
Well, I'm asking
the question where


1349
0:52:51,49 --> 0:52:54,3
you hear I mentioned I
had a study of 100,000 men


1350
0:52:54,3 --> 0:52:56,53
and women that we
took their evidence


1351
0:52:56,53 --> 0:53:0,57
right from the book, which is
another one of the blind spots


1352
0:53:0,57 --> 0:53:3,324
was the number one
complaint women have--


1353
0:53:3,324 --> 0:53:5,74
we asked this question, it
just happened to be the highest


1354
0:53:5,74 --> 0:53:11,16
one-- is, do you experience
that men listen to you?


1355
0:53:11,16 --> 0:53:15,5
And over 70% of women
said men don't listen.


1356
0:53:15,5 --> 0:53:20,5
They asked the men, do
men listen to women?


1357
0:53:20,5 --> 0:53:24,94
And 90% of the men
said, of course.


1358
0:53:24,94 --> 0:53:28,45
So in his world, he's
listening, but in her world,


1359
0:53:28,45 --> 0:53:29,88
she doesn't feel heard.


1360
0:53:29,88 --> 0:53:30,77
That's a gap.


1361
0:53:30,77 --> 0:53:33,62
And, yes, we've done
the research on that.


1362
0:53:33,62 --> 0:53:34,52
I did that book
just because people


1363
0:53:34,52 --> 0:53:35,8
would say what you just said.


1364
0:53:35,8 --> 0:53:37,96
Well, where's your
research on this?


1365
0:53:37,96 --> 0:53:40,29
I probably talked to more
people about relationships


1366
0:53:40,29 --> 0:53:43,9
than anybody in history,
than the whole planet


1367
0:53:43,9 --> 0:53:44,5
history of the world.


1368
0:53:44,5 --> 0:53:46,75
That's all I do
is talk to people


1369
0:53:46,75 --> 0:53:48,92
about relationship experiences.


1370
0:53:48,92 --> 0:53:51,68
Not in a scientific study
with 18 men and women,


1371
0:53:51,68 --> 0:53:55,15
with thousands of people, with
50 people, again and again


1372
0:53:55,15 --> 0:53:55,71
and again.


1373
0:53:55,71 --> 0:53:57,58
And what I see is these themes.


1374
0:53:57,58 --> 0:53:59,16
But I wrote that
book just so people


1375
0:53:59,16 --> 0:54:2,75
who like to look at the digits
could actually see the digits


1376
0:54:2,75 --> 0:54:5,715
and how many women truly see the
world through different eyes.


1377
0:54:5,715 --> 0:54:7,71
But I appreciate the comment.


1378
0:54:7,71 --> 0:54:10,72
It's a force that
we have to overcome,


1379
0:54:10,72 --> 0:54:13,76
because there's a
huge force which


1380
0:54:13,76 --> 0:54:17,4
wants to say we should
all be the same.


1381
0:54:17,4 --> 0:54:18,6
We should all think the same.


1382
0:54:18,6 --> 0:54:20,2
We should all react the same.


1383
0:54:20,2 --> 0:54:22,657
And if we can all
just become one,


1384
0:54:22,657 --> 0:54:24,24
then the world will
be a better place.


1385
0:54:24,24 --> 0:54:26,41
It will be fairer for people.


1386
0:54:26,41 --> 0:54:28,21
It'll be fairer for people.


1387
0:54:28,21 --> 0:54:31,23
We'll be able to
appreciate our differences,


1388
0:54:31,23 --> 0:54:33,15
appreciate our
different strengths,


1389
0:54:33,15 --> 0:54:35,84
and create room for
people to be different.


1390
0:54:35,84 --> 0:54:39,27
That is what will make
this world a better place.


1391
0:54:39,27 --> 0:54:41,88
Yeah, women have a lot more
adrenaline going on than men.


1392
0:54:41,88 --> 0:54:44,77
What happens with
adrenaline is adrenaline


1393
0:54:44,77 --> 0:54:46,484
is produced from dopamine.


1394
0:54:46,484 --> 0:54:48,4
So I'll give you an
example you can relate to.


1395
0:54:48,4 --> 0:54:51,3
As a man, you're driving a
car around 80 miles an hour,


1396
0:54:51,3 --> 0:54:53,27
you feel very relaxed, right?


1397
0:54:53,27 --> 0:54:54,242
Easy going.


1398
0:54:54,242 --> 0:54:56,7
And then you hit it up-- there's
a certain point between 80


1399
0:54:56,7 --> 0:55:0,8
and 120 where most men will
start to feel the adrenaline.


1400
0:55:0,8 --> 0:55:1,63
It's like, rrrr.


1401
0:55:1,63 --> 0:55:4,2
There's like this
rrrr energy inside.


1402
0:55:4,2 --> 0:55:7,67
That's the shifting of dopamine,
which you're confident,


1403
0:55:7,67 --> 0:55:9,49
you're capable, you're online.


1404
0:55:9,49 --> 0:55:10,29
That's dopamine.


1405
0:55:10,29 --> 0:55:12,41
Lots of testosterone
being produced.


1406
0:55:12,41 --> 0:55:15,11
Now your concerns
start to increase.


1407
0:55:15,11 --> 0:55:18,37
That a dropping of your
serotonin, your optimism.


1408
0:55:18,37 --> 0:55:20,37
You're starting to think
of what could go wrong.


1409
0:55:20,37 --> 0:55:22,12
That's serotonin dropping.


1410
0:55:22,12 --> 0:55:24,87
So when your serotonin
levels start to drop,


1411
0:55:24,87 --> 0:55:27,66
your dopamine converts
into adrenaline.


1412
0:55:27,66 --> 0:55:31,49
And adrenaline gives you even
more ability to react fast,


1413
0:55:31,49 --> 0:55:34,31
so you get spikes in
testosterone at that point,


1414
0:55:34,31 --> 0:55:35,81
maybe 10 times more.


1415
0:55:35,81 --> 0:55:38,19
But then you
deplete, so then you


1416
0:55:38,19 --> 0:55:41,107
need more recovery
time afterwards.


1417
0:55:41,107 --> 0:55:43,44
And this is all about how
much adrenaline gets produced.


1418
0:55:43,44 --> 0:55:46,3
For women, your
vulnerability in your brain


1419
0:55:46,3 --> 0:55:48,2
is that because your limbic
system is so much more


1420
0:55:48,2 --> 0:55:50,51
active than men's,
you tend to run out


1421
0:55:50,51 --> 0:55:52,55
of serotonin much
faster than men.


1422
0:55:52,55 --> 0:55:54,46
This is why women
have depression


1423
0:55:54,46 --> 0:55:57,15
four times more than men.


1424
0:55:57,15 --> 0:56:0,59
They run out of serotonin
faster under moderate stress


1425
0:56:0,59 --> 0:56:2,8
as opposed to men.


1426
0:56:2,8 --> 0:56:4,5
Canadian research
shows that men actually


1427
0:56:4,5 --> 0:56:6,76
make serotonin 50%
more efficiently.


1428
0:56:6,76 --> 0:56:8,7
That's because we
have more muscle mass.


1429
0:56:8,7 --> 0:56:13,49
Men store 50% more of residue
serotonin, which is probably


1430
0:56:13,49 --> 0:56:15,911
an evolutionary development,
because you're in danger.


1431
0:56:15,911 --> 0:56:17,41
Your life is in
danger, and you have


1432
0:56:17,41 --> 0:56:19,22
to stay cool,
calm, and collected


1433
0:56:19,22 --> 0:56:22,73
to prevent your dopamine from
converting into adrenaline.


1434
0:56:22,73 --> 0:56:25,41
But adrenaline, particularly,
once you feel adrenalin,


1435
0:56:25,41 --> 0:56:28,49
as a man, you really need to
physically move your body.


1436
0:56:28,49 --> 0:56:30,52
If you don't burn
the adrenalin off


1437
0:56:30,52 --> 0:56:34,41
through physical movement of
the muscles, then what occurs


1438
0:56:34,41 --> 0:56:36,79
is cortisol levels
will start to rise.


1439
0:56:36,79 --> 0:56:39,36
And cortisol levels don't
go away very quickly.


1440
0:56:39,36 --> 0:56:41,4
Adrenaline can
burn off like that.


1441
0:56:41,4 --> 0:56:44,57
But once your cortisol levels
rise, it's sort of a slow rise,


1442
0:56:44,57 --> 0:56:45,759
and it stays in there.


1443
0:56:45,759 --> 0:56:47,3
It's the worst thing
for your health.


1444
0:56:47,3 --> 0:56:50,69
Cortisol inhibits digestion,
inhibits your immune system,


1445
0:56:50,69 --> 0:56:54,31
inhibits your detoxification
system, causes brain injury.


1446
0:56:54,31 --> 0:56:56,26
All those things
are directly related


1447
0:56:56,26 --> 0:56:58,87
to chronically elevated
cortisol levels.


1448
0:56:58,87 --> 0:57:2,5
And this is the world that's
happening for women today.


1449
0:57:2,5 --> 0:57:4,46
So women's health issues
are dropping down.


1450
0:57:4,46 --> 0:57:6,69
More women have heart
attacks than men today.


1451
0:57:6,69 --> 0:57:9,8
And this can all
be remedied-- not


1452
0:57:9,8 --> 0:57:11,76
by saying women should be home.


1453
0:57:11,76 --> 0:57:14,83
It's by saying women should have
a balanced personal life where


1454
0:57:14,83 --> 0:57:16,73
they schedule their
lives so that they're


1455
0:57:16,73 --> 0:57:20,15
doing their testosterone
stimulating activities balanced


1456
0:57:20,15 --> 0:57:26,18
by personal, fulfilling, home
experiences in a personal life


1457
0:57:26,18 --> 0:57:27,83
to balance the work life.


1458
0:57:27,83 --> 0:57:30,44
And it's understanding
all those dynamics


1459
0:57:30,44 --> 0:57:33,3
of what creates
oxytocin in your body


1460
0:57:33,3 --> 0:57:36,17
because our world has become
way too testosterone oriented.


1461
0:57:36,17 --> 0:57:41,48
And ultimately, for men, love is
very important to men, as well.


1462
0:57:41,48 --> 0:57:43,77
And if he comes home, and
a woman can't be loving,


1463
0:57:43,77 --> 0:57:45,99
then you get a man who
doesn't come out of his cave.


1464
0:57:45,99 --> 0:57:49,63
So there's a huge
balance and upset.


1465
0:57:49,63 --> 0:57:52,587
So many of the problems
we experience today


1466
0:57:52,587 --> 0:57:54,92
with all of the mass shootings
and all that stuff that's


1467
0:57:54,92 --> 0:57:55,419
going on.


1468
0:57:55,419 --> 0:57:57,47
We see the kids going
and shooting people.


1469
0:57:57,47 --> 0:57:59,94
These kids are always
on antidepressants


1470
0:57:59,94 --> 0:58:1,561
or antipsychotics.


1471
0:58:1,561 --> 0:58:2,56
They're always on drugs.


1472
0:58:2,56 --> 0:58:5,39
Since we started using
drugs for mental illness,


1473
0:58:5,39 --> 0:58:9,12
there's now, since 1980, 35
times more mental illness


1474
0:58:9,12 --> 0:58:10,36
in America.


1475
0:58:10,36 --> 0:58:12,34
35 times more.


1476
0:58:12,34 --> 0:58:16,17
People, once they start taking
medications, don't go off.


1477
0:58:16,17 --> 0:58:17,78
They do not heal the brain.


1478
0:58:17,78 --> 0:58:20,5
They change the brain, and
the brain-- the problem


1479
0:58:20,5 --> 0:58:21,58
goes worse and worse.


1480
0:58:21,58 --> 0:58:26,21
That whole story is written
in my most recent book, which


1481
0:58:26,21 --> 0:58:28,6
you can all get a
free-- for right now--


1482
0:58:28,6 --> 0:58:31,9
free pre-publication
copy, just doing


1483
0:58:31,9 --> 0:58:33,57
a free download
at marsvenus.com.


1484
0:58:33,57 --> 0:58:38,67
It's called the "Mars Venus
Wellness Solution for Focus,"


1485
0:58:38,67 --> 0:58:40,95
So focus is-- the
challenge for our children


1486
0:58:40,95 --> 0:58:46,48
today is one out of five
boys with ADHD being drugged.


1487
0:58:46,48 --> 0:58:48,12
And what parents
don't realize is


1488
0:58:48,12 --> 0:58:51,95
ADHD drugs cause stunted
growth for young children.


1489
0:58:51,95 --> 0:58:53,89
They cause heart disease.


1490
0:58:53,89 --> 0:58:54,88
Some of them are against
the law in Canada,


1491
0:58:54,88 --> 0:58:56,79
because actually you get
heart attacks from it.


1492
0:58:56,79 --> 0:58:58,331
But long before
heart attacks, you're


1493
0:58:58,331 --> 0:58:59,96
getting arteriosclerosis.


1494
0:58:59,96 --> 0:59:1,77
It also causes
brain changes that


1495
0:59:1,77 --> 0:59:4,96
don't disappear as teenagers
but just turn into addictions


1496
0:59:4,96 --> 0:59:8,51
to caffeine, addictions
to internet porn,


1497
0:59:8,51 --> 0:59:11,75
and the inability to commit
to a long-term relationship.


1498
0:59:11,75 --> 0:59:16,1
These are all the more adult
stages of ADD and ADHD.


1499
0:59:16,1 --> 0:59:18,88
And in the new book, I
map at every stage of life


1500
0:59:18,88 --> 0:59:21,5
how, when we get
ADHD as children,


1501
0:59:21,5 --> 0:59:22,94
and what causes
it-- which they all


1502
0:59:22,94 --> 0:59:24,92
say we don't know-- we do know.


1503
0:59:24,92 --> 0:59:26,6
It's all there in
all the literature.


1504
0:59:26,6 --> 0:59:29,2
I just quote PubMed again
and again, all the causes


1505
0:59:29,2 --> 0:59:32,23
of ADHD, the rampant
imbalance today.


1506
0:59:32,23 --> 0:59:34,86
And as we move through
stages of life,


1507
0:59:34,86 --> 0:59:37,57
people don't recognize
as your brain develops,


1508
0:59:37,57 --> 0:59:39,95
ADHD turns into something else.


1509
0:59:39,95 --> 0:59:42,35
One of the consistent
ingredients that goes along


1510
0:59:42,35 --> 0:59:46,86
with ADHD in an autistic
child, Asperger's child,


1511
0:59:46,86 --> 0:59:51,4
ADHD child is dramatically low
glutathione levels in the body.


1512
0:59:51,4 --> 0:59:53,66
Glutathione protects the
brain from brain energy


1513
0:59:53,66 --> 0:59:55,81
or free radical damage.


1514
0:59:55,81 --> 1:0:0,21
In all those cases, dramatically
low glutathione levels.


1515
1:0:0,21 --> 1:0:3,31
Every person who has dementia
and Alzheimer's-- it is now


1516
1:0:3,31 --> 1:0:5,67
predicted that one out of
three people over 70 will have


1517
1:0:5,67 --> 1:0:7,1
dementia and Alzheimer's.


1518
1:0:7,1 --> 1:0:9,17
My younger sister
has Alzheimer's.


1519
1:0:9,17 --> 1:0:11,85
My older brother has
dementia and early stages


1520
1:0:11,85 --> 1:0:12,86
of Alzheimer's.


1521
1:0:12,86 --> 1:0:16,73
This is becoming another
rampant epidemic in America.


1522
1:0:16,73 --> 1:0:17,932
The cause is so clear.


1523
1:0:17,932 --> 1:0:19,64
They keep saying we
don't know the cause.


1524
1:0:19,64 --> 1:0:22,2
Go right to the
physiology, and you'll


1525
1:0:22,2 --> 1:0:24,36
find that-- I can't go
into all the causes.


1526
1:0:24,36 --> 1:0:27,18
That's a whole other book--
but I talk about the causes.


1527
1:0:27,18 --> 1:0:30,25
I talk about the remedies,
natural remedies.


1528
1:0:30,25 --> 1:0:32,47
But natural remedies
don't work if you


1529
1:0:32,47 --> 1:0:34,436
don't eliminate the causes.


1530
1:0:34,436 --> 1:0:36,6
Say you have a
headache, and I actually


1531
1:0:36,6 --> 1:0:38,65
have a natural pill that will
take away your headache-- which


1532
1:0:38,65 --> 1:0:40,47
I don't, by the way--
but if I had a pill


1533
1:0:40,47 --> 1:0:42,87
to give you to take
away your headache,


1534
1:0:42,87 --> 1:0:45,87
but you keep hitting yourself
in the head with a hammer,


1535
1:0:45,87 --> 1:0:47,35
will that pill work?


1536
1:0:47,35 --> 1:0:47,854
No.


1537
1:0:47,854 --> 1:0:49,52
But for people that
don't hit themselves


1538
1:0:49,52 --> 1:0:52,15
in the head with a
hammer, it will work.


1539
1:0:52,15 --> 1:0:57,26
Well, there are 10,000 studies
on natural solutions for ADD


1540
1:0:57,26 --> 1:0:58,89
and ADHD all over the place.


1541
1:0:58,89 --> 1:1:0,54
They just don't
work all the time,


1542
1:1:0,54 --> 1:1:3,7
as drugs don't work,
because people don't know,


1543
1:1:3,7 --> 1:1:6,77
how am I creating this every
day by my lifestyle choices


1544
1:1:6,77 --> 1:1:7,72
and decisions?


1545
1:1:7,72 --> 1:1:10,84
So, anyway, more on that
subject is at marsvenus.com.


1546
1:1:10,84 --> 1:1:14,299
Just get a free
download of the book.


1547
1:1:14,299 --> 1:1:15,9
For now, it's free.


1548
1:1:15,9 --> 1:1:16,21
Soon it will be on Amazon.


1549
1:1:16,21 --> 1:1:19,51
You can order it and buy
it, but it's an easy read.


1550
1:1:19,51 --> 1:1:24,5
And, particularly, as a techie,
for some techie guys here--


1551
1:1:24,5 --> 1:1:26,862
because they don't realize that
they have huge amounts of ADD,


1552
1:1:26,862 --> 1:1:28,82
because they think, I
have no problem focusing.


1553
1:1:28,82 --> 1:1:31,62
I can focus on my
computer for 10 hours.


1554
1:1:31,62 --> 1:1:34,83
And I remember talking to one
of the world's experts on ADHD,


1555
1:1:34,83 --> 1:1:37,656
and I looked at him, and I
said, you know, you have ADHD.


1556
1:1:37,656 --> 1:1:38,78
He said, that's ridiculous.


1557
1:1:38,78 --> 1:1:40,9
I have total focus.


1558
1:1:40,9 --> 1:1:42,15
I'm so focused, my
wife can talk to me,


1559
1:1:42,15 --> 1:1:43,9
and I don't hear a
word she says while I'm


1560
1:1:43,9 --> 1:1:45,53
thinking about something.


1561
1:1:45,53 --> 1:1:47,26
That's also ADHD.


1562
1:1:47,26 --> 1:1:49,16
That's a problem
with attention where


1563
1:1:49,16 --> 1:1:51,28
you can't shift
your attention here,


1564
1:1:51,28 --> 1:1:53,69
but you become overly
focused on one thing.


1565
1:1:53,69 --> 1:1:55,28
And I'll finished
my talk by talking


1566
1:1:55,28 --> 1:1:58,56
about how ADD is creating
huge problems in relationships


1567
1:1:58,56 --> 1:2:2,45
today, is that it causes
men to become hyperfocused


1568
1:2:2,45 --> 1:2:3,7
on one thing.


1569
1:2:3,7 --> 1:2:5,99
In the beginning, they can
be hyperfocused on her,


1570
1:2:5,99 --> 1:2:7,69
but once the newness
goes away, he


1571
1:2:7,69 --> 1:2:10,1
becomes hyperfocused
on his work,


1572
1:2:10,1 --> 1:2:14,29
and he doesn't take the time
to rebuild his testosterone.


1573
1:2:14,29 --> 1:2:17,45
The average for a man at 50 has
half the testosterone levels


1574
1:2:17,45 --> 1:2:18,82
he had as a younger man.


1575
1:2:18,82 --> 1:2:21,24
I have 25% more.


1576
1:2:21,24 --> 1:2:22,671
And I know exactly how I did it.


1577
1:2:22,671 --> 1:2:25,17
I explain it in my books, so
I'll live a long, healthy life.


1578
1:2:25,17 --> 1:2:27,1
This is why men die, is
their testosterone levels


1579
1:2:27,1 --> 1:2:27,78
start dropping.


1580
1:2:27,78 --> 1:2:29,18
Dopamine levels drop.


1581
1:2:29,18 --> 1:2:32,54
But, anyway, focus-- for men,
they become hyperfocused.


1582
1:2:32,54 --> 1:2:35,98
And for women, they become
hyperfocused on the things that


1583
1:2:35,98 --> 1:2:39,17
would, theoretically, release
oxytocin-- other people's


1584
1:2:39,17 --> 1:2:39,99
needs.


1585
1:2:39,99 --> 1:2:41,81
So they're overwhelmed.


1586
1:2:41,81 --> 1:2:46,35
So overwhelm, the adult symptom
of ADHD, is so common in women,


1587
1:2:46,35 --> 1:2:47,84
it's unbelievable.


1588
1:2:47,84 --> 1:2:49,33
It's like, I have
no time for me.


1589
1:2:49,33 --> 1:2:50,77
I have to do this
for this person.


1590
1:2:50,77 --> 1:2:52,7
Who says?


1591
1:2:52,7 --> 1:2:54,96
It's your brain taking
on more than you can do.


1592
1:2:54,96 --> 1:2:56,47
This is ADHD.


1593
1:2:56,47 --> 1:2:58,25
And it can be corrected.


1594
1:2:58,25 --> 1:3:0,61
These are simple solutions
for all these things.


1595
1:3:0,61 --> 1:3:2,34
I have people writing
it to me, it's


1596
1:3:2,34 --> 1:3:4,56
like, my child is now
taking your vitamin C


1597
1:3:4,56 --> 1:3:6,665
and grapeseed extract
that you recommended,


1598
1:3:6,665 --> 1:3:7,665
and he suddenly changed.


1599
1:3:7,665 --> 1:3:10,289
And he says, Daddy, I like this
so much more than the medicine.


1600
1:3:10,289 --> 1:3:11,81
This makes me feel so good.


1601
1:3:11,81 --> 1:3:14,26
Just simple anti-inflammatories
for the brain


1602
1:3:14,26 --> 1:3:17,41
rather than taking a drug
that does not cure anything,


1603
1:3:17,41 --> 1:3:19,67
nor do they claim
to cure anything.


1604
1:3:19,67 --> 1:3:23,1
It only creates more of the
same problem that caused ADHD


1605
1:3:23,1 --> 1:3:26,78
in the first place, very
similar to any drug addiction.


1606
1:3:26,78 --> 1:3:28,96
Anyway, you've been a great
audience here at Google.


1607
1:3:28,96 --> 1:3:32,29
Thanks for inviting me,
and thanks for the great


1608
1:3:32,29 --> 1:3:33,49
work that you do.


1609
1:3:33,49 --> 1:3:35,34
Appreciate it.


1610
1:3:35,34 --> 1:5:35,34
