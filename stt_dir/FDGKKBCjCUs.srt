reports on the most fabulous
fashion weeks in the world,

and the culture and politics
behind them.

Tel Aviv's second

fashion week in 30 years.

any later, it

No sooner had the last model
left the runway, the conflict


18
0:1:19,14 --> 0:1:22,22
between Israel and Palestine
escalated to the worst it's


19
0:1:22,22 --> 0:1:25,78
been in recent history, with
Tel Aviv's Iron Dome being


20
0:1:25,78 --> 0:1:29,15
breached for the first time by
missiles sent from Gaza.


21
0:1:29,15 --> 0:1:31,4
-Tel Aviv came under rocket
attack for the


22
0:1:31,4 --> 0:1:33,36
first time in 21 years.


23

Hamas fired over 300 rockets
at Israel in 24 hours.

-Tel Aviv is the economic center
of Israel, and secular

Known for it's 24-hour party
lifestyle and thriving gay


27

scene, it's not hard to see why
it's gained a reputation


28
0:1:51,612 --> 0:1:54,365
as the home of hedonism
in the holy land.


29
0:1:54,365 --> 0:2:0,14



30
0:2:0,14 --> 0:2:2,82
The event kicked off with
a press junket where the


31
0:2:2,82 --> 0:2:5,79
president of Tel Aviv fashion
week fielded questions from


32
0:2:5,79 --> 0:2:8,55
local and foreign press.


33
0:2:8,55 --> 0:3:5,64



34
0:3:5,64 --> 0:3:9,62
-Body mass index, or BMI, is the
globally accepted method


35
0:3:9,62 --> 0:3:12,87
for estimating human body fat
based on an individual's


36
0:3:12,87 --> 0:3:17,42
weight and height, and a BMI
of below 18.5 is considered


37
0:3:17,42 --> 0:3:19,62
underweight.


38
0:3:19,62 --> 0:3:23,7
The law is contentious because
BMI is a general measurement


39
0:3:23,7 --> 0:3:26,18
and doesn't take things like
genetics or race into account.


40
0:3:26,18 --> 0:3:30,65



41
0:3:30,65 --> 0:3:33,405
The opening show was none other
than Italian fashion


42

house Moschino.


43
0:3:34,655 --> 0:3:38,2



44
0:3:38,2 --> 0:3:40,75
I was intrigued to hear what
such a big designer would


45
0:3:40,75 --> 0:3:43,66
think of the law.


46

Somewhere like this that maybe
next year they're not going to


50
0:3:54,16 --> 0:3:56,16
be able to work with the
international standard of


51
0:3:56,16 --> 0:3:58,66
models because of
their BMI law.


52

What do you think about that?

about making women


54
0:4:3,16 --> 0:4:4,16

55
0:4:4,16 --> 0:4:7,284
You know, fashion sells a
dream, and everything's


56
0:4:7,284 --> 0:4:9,228
supposed to look as beautiful as
possible, but that doesn't


57
0:4:9,228 --> 0:4:12,53
necessarily mean
ill, obviously.


58
0:4:12,53 --> 0:4:13,87
-Cool and beautiful.


59
0:4:13,87 --> 0:4:16,72
I couldn't agree more, but
couldn't help but wonder how


60
0:4:16,72 --> 0:4:18,99
the global fashion industry
would be affected if


61
0:4:18,99 --> 0:4:21,29
legislation was passed
worldwide.


62
0:4:21,29 --> 0:4:23,723
The very makeup of high fashion
would be impacted.

66

model is dictated by law.


67
0:4:53,68 --> 0:4:55,769
How does that make you feel?


68
0:4:55,769 --> 0:5:18,47



69
0:5:18,47 --> 0:5:20,66
-How can you hope to compete
with an international


70
0:5:20,66 --> 0:5:25,23
aesthetic standard of how models
should look if you're


71
0:5:25,23 --> 0:5:28,782
not allowed to use that
look anymore?


72
0:5:28,782 --> 0:5:36,48



73

-I could understand
that [INAUDIBLE]


74
0:5:38,11 --> 0:5:40,56
didn't want his fashion week to
be engulfed in an argument


75
0:5:40,56 --> 0:5:44,19
about anorexic models, but to
say it doesn't matter just


76
0:5:44,19 --> 0:5:48,3
sounded obtuse, especially
given the facts.

0:6:3,0 --> 0:6:5,73
-Across town, there was another
fashion event being


79
0:6:5,73 --> 0:6:10,7
held by people who think
this matters very much.


80
0:6:10,7 --> 0:6:14,2
Simply U, a model agency that
strictly represents girls with


81
0:6:14,2 --> 0:6:17,5
a healthy BMI, was having a
dinner during the fashion week


82
0:6:17,5 --> 0:6:20,17
to commiserate its models for
being too overweight for


83
0:6:20,17 --> 0:6:21,42
current catwalk standards.


84
0:6:21,42 --> 0:6:24,9



85
0:6:24,9 --> 0:6:28,41
Simply U was founded by Adi
Barkan, an Israeli fashion


86

one-time publisher of racy

89
0:6:35,7 --> 0:6:41,755



90
0:6:41,755 --> 0:6:45,45
-Adi's career took a u-turn
in the 90s when a model he


91
0:6:45,45 --> 0:6:48,69
advised to lose a few pounds
consequently almost starved


92
0:6:48,69 --> 0:6:49,94
herself to death.


93
0:6:49,94 --> 0:6:58,59



94
0:6:58,59 --> 0:7:2,1
-Since then, Adi has put all
his energy into pushing


95
0:7:2,1 --> 0:7:4,61
through legislation stating that
models with a BMI under

creates such controversial

wagging when he did a shoot

"BelleMode," in which he

parodied a news story about
segregation on public buses.

they sit at the back of

Can't We All Just Get Along?,"

-Even though it had been fun,
there were definitely some


127
0:14:56,8 --> 0:14:58,925
moments where I wondered if
this was the kind of thing


128
0:14:58,925 --> 0:15:0,56

on your head.


129
0:15:0,56 --> 0:15:7,33



130
0:15:7,33 --> 0:15:9,64
There was something a bit
carpe diem about Lior's


131
0:15:9,64 --> 0:15:14,42
attitude to sensationalizing
such a situation.


132
0:15:14,42 --> 0:15:17,54
But upon my arrival back in
fashion week, it seemed Lior


133
0:15:17,54 --> 0:15:21,39
wasn't the only one putting his
own spin on the conflict.

137
0:16:20,15 --> 0:16:23,5
Mr. Moschino had said fashion
week was about selling a


138
0:16:23,5 --> 0:16:26,71
dream, but in this case, it
felt like Tel Aviv fashion


139
0:16:26,71 --> 0:16:29,78
week was about selling
Tel Aviv.


140
0:16:29,78 --> 0:16:33,64
Despite its reputation as a
liberal, European-style city,


141
0:16:33,64 --> 0:16:37,14
its location means most people
approach it with caution.


142
0:16:37,14 --> 0:16:40,29
And if any creative industry
were to thrive, it needs to be


143
0:16:40,29 --> 0:16:42,61
regarded differently.


144
0:16:42,61 --> 0:16:45,22
And unfortunately, the day
after the fashion week


145
0:16:45,22 --> 0:16:51,13
finished, something happened
that showed just why that is.


146
0:16:51,13 --> 0:16:53,81
The Israeli defense force
launched something called


147
0:16:53,81 --> 0:16:57,9
Operation Pillar of Defense
to eliminate militants and


148
0:16:57,9 --> 0:17:0,3
weapons sites in the Gaza
Strip, which began by


149
0:17:0,3 --> 0:17:4,5
assassinating Hamas military
chief, Ahmed al-Jabari, in a


150
0:17:4,5 --> 0:17:6,119
targeted missile attack
in Gaza City.


151
0:17:6,119 --> 0:17:9,55

0:17:9,55 --> 0:17:12,39
Suddenly, the bomb hats
didn't feel so funny.


153
0:17:12,39 --> 0:17:18,29



154
0:17:18,29 --> 0:17:21,299
The next morning, we were
hanging out on a test shoot


155
0:17:21,299 --> 0:17:24,579
with some of girls from
Adi Barkan's agency.


156
0:17:24,579 --> 0:17:27,64
Our original plan had been to
spend some time with female


157
0:17:27,64 --> 0:17:30,92
soldiers of the Israeli Defense
Force, but after


158
0:17:30,92 --> 0:17:35,37
launching Operation Pillar of
Defense, they cancelled.


159
0:17:35,37 --> 0:17:38,36
The IDF is unique in that it's
the only army in the world


160
0:17:38,36 --> 0:17:42,41
that requires national service
to be completed by girls.


161
0:17:42,41 --> 0:17:45,64
To the delight of weird war
nerds across the world, the


162

No one is exempt, not even
bona fide supermodels.


165
0:17:55,38 --> 0:17:59,43
-Esti Ginzburg, 19-year-old
Israeli supermodel, recently


166
0:17:59,43 --> 0:18:2,93
decided, unlike some other
Israeli celebrities, to not


167
0:18:2,93 --> 0:18:6,57
avoid serving her obligatory two
years of military service.


168
0:18:6,57 --> 0:18:8,88
ESTI GINZBURG: If you live in
this country, and you grow up


169
0:18:8,88 --> 0:18:11,7
in this country, then you have
to serve and do the minimum.


170
0:18:11,7 --> 0:18:13,72
It's the values that
I grew up on.


171
0:18:13,72 --> 0:18:16,18
And I always knew that I'm going
to go in, and even tough


172
0:18:16,18 --> 0:18:20,34
it's hard, it's what
I need to do.


173
0:18:20,34 --> 0:18:22,66
-As a result, the girls
of the IDF have become


174
0:18:22,66 --> 0:18:24,55
something of a fetish.


175
0:18:24,55 --> 0:18:27,805

the hot girls of the IDF.


176
0:18:27,805 --> 0:18:32,5



177
0:18:32,5 --> 0:18:35,62
And I'd been super excited about
learning how to do this


178

from a hot tank instructor.

0:20:31,23 --> 0:20:34,19
residents were hearing the
whine of air raid sirens,


206
0:20:34,19 --> 0:20:38,658
warning them to take cover
from incoming missiles.


207
0:20:38,658 --> 0:20:40,134
-[SPEAKING HEBREW]


208
0:20:40,134 --> 0:20:44,92



209
0:20:44,92 --> 0:20:48,28
-The Israeli Air Force pounded
dozens of targets in Gaza,


210
0:20:48,28 --> 0:20:50,19
including missile storage
facilities


211
0:20:50,19 --> 0:20:51,49
and launching sites.


212
0:20:51,49 --> 0:20:54,15
Among the weapons destroyed were
rockets that could hit as


213
0:20:54,15 --> 0:20:57,22
far as 25 miles into Israel.


214
0:20:57,22 --> 0:21:0,21
Defense minister, Ehud Barak,
has mobilized the first


215
0:21:0,21 --> 0:21:2,51
reserve infantry units.


216
0:21:2,51 --> 0:21:6,0
-55,000 Israeli troops were
being mobilized along the


217
0:21:6,0 --> 0:21:9,9
border, and among them,
Margo's boyfriend.


218
0:21:9,9 --> 0:21:13,23
That really brought
the news home.


219
0:21:13,23 --> 0:21:15,62
The foreign office was advising
people to get out of


220
0:21:15,62 --> 0:21:20,1
the country, but it was late,
and we decided to sleep on it


221
0:21:20,1 --> 0:21:21,68
and see what the morning
looked like.


222
0:21:21,68 --> 0:21:33,584



223
0:21:33,584 --> 0:21:36,64
[AIR RAID SIRENS]


224
0:21:36,64 --> 0:21:38,48
-Oh, you fucking--


225
0:21:38,48 --> 0:22:15,14



226
0:22:15,14 --> 0:22:18,16
-I'd never heard an air
raid siren before.


227
0:22:18,16 --> 0:22:21,28
What you're meant to do is take
shelter underground, not


228
0:22:21,28 --> 0:22:23,97
stand out on the balcony like
us, trying to spot the rocket


229
0:22:23,97 --> 0:22:27,56
like some kind of firework
display from hell.


230
0:22:27,56 --> 0:22:33,69
-I'm googling like, what to do,
siren, basement, Tel Aviv.


231
0:22:33,69 --> 0:22:36,16
-Soon, people had returned to
the streets from wherever


232
0:22:36,16 --> 0:22:38,55
they'd sheltered and got on
with whatever they'd been


233
0:22:38,55 --> 0:22:40,69
doing before.


234
0:22:40,69 --> 0:22:45,2
-Somebody's delivering pizza.


235
0:22:45,2 --> 0:22:46,535
-It was as if nothing
had happened.


236
0:22:46,535 --> 0:22:57,27



237
0:22:57,27 --> 0:23:0,55
Even on the beach a mere half
mile from where the rocket had


238
0:23:0,55 --> 0:23:4,38
smashed into the sea, friends
played Frisbee, and dads did


239
0:23:4,38 --> 0:23:8,21
Tai Chi with their kids.


240
0:23:8,21 --> 0:23:10,74
None of this [INAUDIBLE] with
the official foreign office


241
0:23:10,74 --> 0:23:13,78
advice to get out now.


242
0:23:13,78 --> 0:23:16,73
And as we made our way home
to pack, I wish we'd


243
0:23:16,73 --> 0:23:17,98
had more time here.


244
0:23:17,98 --> 0:23:21,8



245
0:23:21,8 --> 0:23:23,571
However, all our appointments
had been cancelled, and there


246
0:23:23,571 --> 0:23:27,668
was nothing we could do.


247
0:23:27,668 --> 0:24:33,803
