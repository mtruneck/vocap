###2 MS. NULAND: All right, everybody. Happy Friday. We are late. I apologize for that, but there
###9 were more interesting things going on at the White House with personnel announcements today.
###14 I have a bunch of things at the top.
###17 I want to start by noting that our Reuters colleague and Arshad's partner, Andy Quinn,
###26 is moving on after 25 years at Reuters and more than three years here at the State Department.
###32 He's heading to the Aspen Institute to lead a new Africa-focused program. Those of you
###39 who are briefing regulars know that Andy is an extraordinary colleague, that he was completely
###46 committed to the story and to reporting it with integrity and with passion. He was also
###53 a joy to travel with and to be with. We're going to miss you, Andy, but we're very glad
###59 that you're staying in the foreign policy realm and continuing to contribute internationally.
###66 I have one other thing, which is with regard to the Jordanian parliamentary elections.
###74 We want to take this opportunity, since we didn't brief yesterday right after the elections,
###79 to congratulate the people of Jordan on their January 23rd parliamentary elections. We view
###85 these elections as an important step in the ongoing reform process initiated by King Abdullah
###90 II. We note that international election observers found that the voting process saw an improvement
###98 over past elections and that the elections were conducted in a transparent and credible
###103 manner. But they also offered recommendations about continuing to improve Jordan's electoral
###110 process going forward.
###111 In particular, the observers praised the work of the independent electoral commission which
###117 administered these elections for the first time. We look forward to the Government and
###122 people of Jordan building on this milestone and carrying out additional political and
###127 economic reforms for the benefit of all Jordanians. Jordan is a vital strategic partner of the
###132 United States, and we will continue to support Jordan's leadership and the Jordanian people
###137 in their reform process.
###138 Let's go to what's on your minds.
###141 QUESTION: One quick thing, Toria. Thanks so much for your comments about Andy. Speaking
###146 for myself, but I suspect also for my colleagues here and at Reuters, he really is an unusually
###153 elegant writer and a decent and thoroughly good-hearted man, and a very wry - with a
###158 very wry and gentle wit. And I will miss him.
###160 Maybe we can go to substance, now that we've --
###165 QUESTION: (Inaudible) say is that we're going to miss Andy, I guess.
###170 QUESTION: North Korea threatening to go to war with the South?
###176 MS. NULAND: As you know, my colleague Jay Carney spoke to these issues yesterday. These
###185 statements coming out in North Korea are needlessly provocative. Any kind of further test would
###191 be another significant violation of UN Security Council resolutions and only will serve to
###198 further Pyongyang's isolation. As you all know, the UN Security Council passed Resolution
###205 2087 earlier in the week in response to the December missile launch, and that resolution
###214 tightens the sanctions on North Korea and works hard to ensure that it cannot succeed
###222 as a proliferator of missile technology, et cetera.
###226 And it's just - it's really a pretty sad story because the new North Korean leader has a
###235 choice to make, as the Secretary has said so many times. He can serve to focus on the
###240 needs of his people, to bring his country out of isolation and back into compliance
###245 with international obligations, open it back up to the world, or he can continue to waste
###251 what little money the country has on missile technologies and things while his people go
###257 hungry. So --
###258 QUESTION: I have a question on that. The new leader is not all that new. I mean, you have
###264 a pattern of events that you can look at - the original failed test, the subsequent missile
###273 test that was successful, and now the threat to conduct a third nuclear test. Does it seem
###282 to you all now that he has made his choice and how - what kind of a strategy, a diplomatic
###291 strategy, can you pursue if he is not interested in serious talks about his nuclear and ballistic
###298 missile programs?
###299 MS. NULAND: Well, you're not wrong that the pattern of choices is concerning, which is
###304 why we felt very strongly that the international community - oh, we seem to have some guests.
###310 Hi, guys. Not sure who they were, but I think they were lost.
###319 So again, the pattern of choices appears to be quite concerning. That's why it's been
###325 so important to keep the international community united in response to these negative choices,
###333 why we took the time we did to get it right with Resolution 2087, to make clear to North
###340 Korea that particularly the Six-Party states, including all of North Korea's neighbors,
###348 are united in ensuring that there is a price to say, that there will be increasing sanctions,
###355 that we are going to be vigilant about their proliferation activity, the activities of
###359 their banks, and that it's going to take the country in the wrong direction.
###363 I think you know that Ambassador Glyn Davies is out in the region now. He is in Beijing
###369 today, had very productive and useful meetings with counterparts there, including Vice Foreign
###376 Minister Fu Ying, his counterpart Special Representative for Korean Peninsula Affairs
###382 Wu Dawei, and others. He was in Seoul yesterday and he's going on to Tokyo tomorrow. So very
###390 much a project to stay coordinated with our Six-Party counterparts in watching this and
###398 in ensuring that North Korea gets the message that nothing good is going to come from this.
###403 QUESTION: And turn back to the China issue in this whole mix. Today, the Chinese press
###411 seemed to be suggesting that they've told North Korea that if it goes ahead with its
###416 nuclear test that they will actually - Beijing could cut its aid to Pyongyang. That seems
###422 to be an interesting move on the part of the Chinese. What would you have to say on that?
###427 MS. NULAND: Well, I didn't see those particular comments. But we have, as you know, regularly
###433 encouraged Beijing to use the significant influence that it has with Pyongyang. They
###439 have, at various times, been able to make clear that the continued support of Beijing
###448 in terms of trade, aid, the energy relationship, et cetera, depends on North Korea making the
###455 right choices. Again, China joins strongly with us in Resolution 2087, which was important,
###463 and we, as Glyn Davies said - he had a very good visit to Beijing in terms of plotting
###467 the course forward together.
###468 QUESTION: How important - if they go ahead and do something like that - how important
###472 could such a cut in Chinese aid to North Korea be in changing the calculations of the North
###478 Korean leadership?
###478 MS. NULAND: Well, I don't want to speculate on scenarios to be determined. But obviously,
###484 North Korea remains quite dependent on its aid and trade relationship with Beijing.
###488 Jill, still on this?
###488 QUESTION: Toria, are the Six-Party Talks off, as they seem to be indicating in the North
###493 Korean statement?
###494 MS. NULAND: Well, we've made clear for more than a year now that the Six-Party Talks couldn't
###501 go forward to a new round unless we saw real evidence that the DPRK was prepared to meet
###508 its obligations. So we're still in the state that we've been for more than a year in terms
###513 of not having the kind of intent that we need to go forward.
###516 QUESTION: New topic?
###517 MS. NULAND: Still on North Korea?
###519 QUESTION: Still on North Korea.
###519 MS. NULAND: Yeah. Please, here.
###520 QUESTION: Do you - this time around, do you have any reason to believe the North Koreans
###524 will get that message and actually take astep on - well, make the - what you would call
###530 the right choice and actually open up to dialogue, or perhaps discontinue their programs or even
###535 do anything in the right direction?
###537 MS. NULAND: Well, anybody who endeavored to be predictive about North Korean behavior
###542 is probably foolish. But what's been important to us is strong unity among the Six-Party
###548 Talks countries, strong unity in the region about a positive course forward, and the fact
###554 that there will be consequences if they keep making bad choices.
###556 QUESTION: One more?
###558 MS. NULAND: Yeah.
###560 QUESTION: What types of consequences?
###563 MS. NULAND: Well, I think --
###564 QUESTION: Because there's been few besides UN resolutions that haven't changed their
###567 behavior. There hasn't really been any significant consequences otherwise.
###569 MS. NULAND: I would reject that, Brad. If you look at UN Security Council that was just
###576 passed, 2087, and go through it, and I would commend to you the fact sheet that USUN put
###583 out on this, it imposes new sanctions on North Korean companies and government agencies,
###589 including a broad range of sanctions against their space agency, which was responsible
###594 for the launch, as well as the Bank of East Land and several individuals in the North
###599 Korean system who had previously not been sanctioned. Six entities and four individuals
###604 will have their assets frozen and will be prohibited from engaging in financial transactions.
###610 This is UN sanctions, not just U.S. sanctions. There's an updated list of nuclear and ballistic
###615 missile technology that's going to be banned from transfer to or from the DPRK. I could
###620 continue. But --
###620 QUESTION: Do you think there's space to squeeze them further on the sanctions route, that
###625 this country which is perhaps the most heavily sanctioned in the world can still be - there's
###630 still consequences along this sanctions route left?
###633 MS. NULAND: Well, obviously, and we wouldn't have put new sanctions on them if we didn't
###637 think that they would be effective.
###638 Please.
###638 QUESTION: I just wanted to follow up quickly as far as North Korea's missile technology
###641 or missiles are concerned. Despite UN Security Council resolutions or UN sanctions, international
###648 sanctions, still North Korea is continuing and not listening to the international community.
###653 So if China is with you, Madam, since China was always helping North Korea. But who else
###659 is behind this technology or behind North Korea?
###662 MS. NULAND: Well, again, I think what we just have been through here is the fact that the
###668 international community now with this new resolution has spoken with one voice in putting
###673 on increasingly tough sanctions on the DPRK, including getting at the space agency, getting
###680 at the banks, naming individuals who had not previously been named, as contributing to
###687 taking the country in the wrong direction. And we will continue to look for further opportunities
###692 to make our views clear in this kind of a way if the DPRK doesn't change course.
###698 QUESTION: And when this new leader came in North Korea, everybody hoped that things will
###702 change to the right direction for the people of North Korea, but still they are going in
###708 the worst direction as far as the people are concerned.
###710 MS. NULAND: Well, again, we would certainly agree with that. I mean, as you know, we were
###715 a year ago engaged in trying to work out some kind of a food assistance deal, but we didn't
###722 get the kind of assurance that we needed from the government that it was going to go to
###727 the right place. So it's very disappointing.
###729 Please.
###729 QUESTION: Thank you.
###730 QUESTION: Does the United States have any separate plan for additional sanctions toward
###738 North Korea for the third nuclear test?
###743 MS. NULAND: In response to the December test, what you will see and what you've seen in
###748 the last couple of days are U.S. decisions that implement the larger UN Security Council
###756 decisions in 2087. So you're starting to see us put out our own sanctioning information
###766 to ensure that we are complying now in our own law with 2087.
###770 Said.
###771 QUESTION: Can we change topics?
###773 MS. NULAND: Yes.
###774 QUESTION: The Israeli elections?
###776 MS. NULAND: Yeah.
###777 QUESTION: Okay. I wonder if you have a reaction to the outcome of the election, the election
###780 result, and how is that likely to impact the peace process?
###784 MS. NULAND: Well, I think we said, whether it was - I guess it was on Tuesday before
###790 the election or on election day that Israel has a vibrant democracy. We are at the stage
###797 now, as you know, where we're going to have to wait and see what the makeup of the Israeli
###803 Government is going to be and how it approaches the longstanding critical issues that we share.
###809 But we've been absolutely clear that as soon as the parties are ready, we want to make
###814 a renewed push to try to get them back to the table.
###817 QUESTION: Do you believe that the new coalition is likely to be more inclined towards some
###823 sort of a peace resolution?
###825 MS. NULAND: The new coalition which hasn't yet been decided and announced?
###829 QUESTION: I mean, there is - okay, let me rephrase that. Do you expect the new coalition
###833 to be more engaged in the peace process than the former one?
###837 MS. NULAND: I think we're not going to be evaluating a coalition that's still trying
###841 to come together, Said.
###842 QUESTION: Okay. Let me just - let's follow up with another point.
###844 MS. NULAND: Yeah.
###845 QUESTION: I asked a former U.S. ambassador to Israel yesterday what is the overriding
###851 message of this Israeli election, and he said that the message to the Palestinians is that
###858 you are not on our radar screen. Do you see that as the case?
###861 MS. NULAND: I don't think we've had any indication from Israel that that is the case. As you
###868 know, before these elections there was - there were - there have been public statements from
###872 both Israelis and Palestinians that they want to try to get back to the table. And we're
###876 going to try to work on those as soon as we can.
###877 QUESTION: Can I ask you, did you find it reassuring that centrist movement performed better than
###885 expected and that parties that seem to be more hostile to the two-state peace solution
###891 performed worse than had been prognosticated?
###894 MS. NULAND: Again, I think the wonderful thing about democracy is that the people get to
###899 speak, then politicians have to take the lessons from that and move forward. In the case of
###904 a system like Israel, they've got to form a government, and we're not going to prejudge
###907 how the Israeli - those elected --
###911 QUESTION: I'm not asking about the coalition. I'm just talking about what the Israeli people
###915 chose, what they voted for. Do you find that reassuring that they voted primarily for parties
###920 that agree or in broad brushstrokes agree with the principles you've espoused?
###927 MS. NULAND: I think what we find reassuring is that Israel continues to be a democratic
###932 beacon out there in the world and to have a very vibrant system and process for ensuring
###938 that the people's voices are heard in the political process. But how that's going to
###942 translate in terms of either government formation or government policy is to be determined.
###946 QUESTION: All right. But I'm asking you specifically about the peace process --
###948 MS. NULAND: I understand, Brad, and I don't think --
###950 QUESTION: -- and there was a wide range of views regarding the - how peace should be
###955 pursued or not pursued or however. And do you find it reassuring that parties that seem
###960 - that want peace and that have publicly called for a two-state peace solution, according
###968 to the principles you've outlined, are in the driver's seat?
###973 MS. NULAND: Again, you can ask this question however many ways you want, Brad. I'm not
###977 going to comment or opine or speculate as to how the election results are going to --
###984 QUESTION: Speculation? It's just not even a speculation question.
###985 MS. NULAND: Will you let me finish? How the election results are going to translate into
###989 either coalition formulation or the policies of the government, which are what will matter,
###994 obviously, until the Israelis have had a chance to make those decisions.
###997 QUESTION: (Inaudible) a renewed push on that. You're ready to make a - the Administration
###1001 is ready to make a renewed push in the region for peace. Have you ideas on how to set that
###1007 forward, where we talk about direct talks between the two sides, are we talking about
###1009 another exchange of letters? What would it consist of it?
###1013 MS. NULAND: Well, we've always favored getting the parties to direct talks, to a table together,
###1019 as quickly as we can. So we will continue to talk to both sides about what makes most
###1024 sense and how quickly we can move.
###1026 QUESTION: Because I think there might have to be some kind of guarantees on both sides.
###1030 I mean, obviously the Palestinians have long asked for the settlement building to be halted,
###1034 and that would bring them back to the table. And on the Israeli side, there are also obviously
###1042 similar conditions that they'd like to lay down. Do you see some kind of the United States
###1047 facilitating some kind of conditions? How would it - how would it work?
###1051 MS. NULAND: Well, for decades, as you know, we have endeavored to facilitate this process
###1056 however appears best based on where the parties are at the time. But I think again, at the
###1061 stage that we're at, which is three days after an Israeli election and before a new government
###1067 is formed and we've had a chance to talk to them about policies going forward, I'm certainly
###1070 not going to speculate on the how. We know where we want to go and we know where we believe
###1075 they also want to go. If we can be helpful, we will continue to try.
###1080 Jill.
###1081 QUESTION: Syria?
###1082 MS. NULAND: Yeah.
###1083 QUESTION: Before we go on to Syria, I have one more question. What steps should the Palestinians
###1086 take as a result of this election right now? What kind of thing do you urge them to do
###1092 immediately?
###1092 MS. NULAND: I'm not going to be, from this podium here, giving advice to one side or
###1098 the other. You know the general principles that we're speaking of here in terms of undergirding
###1103 an environment for peace. I think we've spoken both in the Israeli context and in the Palestinian
###1109 context about avoiding unilateral actions that could undercut the environment for peace.
###1115 That's still our message for both sides as we get to a place where we've got interlocutors
###1121 who are ready to talk.
###1122 QUESTION: And finally, I know the Secretary has been very busy, but did she call Mr. Netanyahu
###1128 personally to congratulate him?
###1128 MS. NULAND: To my knowledge, she has not made any calls out to Israel at this stage.
###1134 QUESTION: On Syria, there was a bit of confusion yesterday about the former spokesman either
###1140 being in the United States, somebody - the U.S. wanting to give him the visa, et cetera.
###1144 Can you set the record straight, please?
###1146 MS. NULAND: I can. Mr. Makdisi is not in the United States. Ambassador Ford misspoke. He
###1153 is not here.
###1153 QUESTION: Is there any intent to bring him here?
###1155 MS. NULAND: I don't have anything for you on that. I don't - I also don't have anything
###1158 for you on where he actually is.
###1160 QUESTION: Do you have anything on where Assad's mother may be?
###1165 MS. NULAND: I do not.
###1168 QUESTION: So there was a statement attributed to Ambassador Ford suggesting that Assad's
###1171 mother was in the Gulf region. Is that wrong?
###1174 MS. NULAND: Again, on that one, I'll leave Ambassador Ford's comments where they were.
###1180 QUESTION: But you have no reason to doubt them?
###1181 MS. NULAND: I don't.
###1182 QUESTION: Thank you.
###1184 QUESTION: Okay. And also rumors that Mr. Brahimi is submitting a very bleak report on Tuesday,
###1191 and thereafter he might turn in his resignation that - because he's meeting a brick wall.
###1196 Do you have any comment on that?
###1198 MS. NULAND: Well, obviously, I think we need to let Mr. Brahimi bring his report forward
###1202 before we prejudge where it might go. We have, as you know, tried very hard to be supportive
###1208 of his efforts, to collaborate with him in his work, to flesh out the transitional government
###1218 idea, to work to bring the Russians in. But we look forward to hearing what he thinks
###1224 needs to be done now when he reports.
###1225 QUESTION: Do you believe that his mission and his effort has run its course?
###1230 MS. NULAND: We have not had those indications from him, but we await to hear what he has
###1234 to say. We continue to believe that the role that he is playing, the facilitation he's
###1239 trying to do, can be useful in conjunction with a lot of other things that we're also
###1244 working on, as we've been clear about.
###1245 QUESTION: And finally, in his testimony yesterday, Senator Kerry said that we want to bring in
###1249 the Russians on the Syria situation. In what ways, what different ways would he do that
###1256 other than what, let's say, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has done so far with the Russians?
###1261 MS. NULAND: Well, Said, let me just say, and let me say to everybody for the record, just
###1269 to remind you how our democratic process works here, as you all saw, Senator Kerry had a
###1277 chance in his confirmation hearings yesterday to have a really full exchange with the members
###1283 of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on a huge range of issues, not just Syria
###1288 but it was really a tour all the way around the world. That is American democracy in action.
###1295 We want to see his speedy confirmation. But until we have the Senate's advice and consent,
###1302 it would not be appropriate for me to speak from this podium for him or to try to parse
###1310 his words or speculate as to where a secretaryship led by a Secretary Kerry will take us. He
###1319 obviously spoke extremely eloquently for himself, and I would commend the transcript to you.
###1325 Please.
###1326 QUESTION: New subject?
###1326 MS. NULAND: Yeah.
###1328 QUESTION: Follow up Syria? A U.S. delegation has visited Jordan and Turkey. I don't know
###1335 if they are still in the region. Is there any readout or update? We have seen some photo
###1341 ops. But I'm - what's your readout on those visits?
###1347 MS. NULAND: Well, you are right, Ilhan, that we have a U.S. delegation comprised of our
###1353 Assistant Secretary for Population, Refugees, and Migration Anne Richard, USAID Assistant
###1361 Administrator Nancy Lindborg, and Ambassador Ford. They visited the Islahiyah refugee camp
###1369 in Turkey yesterday. They also had a chance yesterday to be in Ankara to meet with Turkish
###1375 officials and some of the members of the Syrian Opposition Coalition Assistance Coordination
###1380 Unit. This is the unit that the SOC created to try to work better with the international
###1386 community both on humanitarian and on other kinds of assistance to the Syrian people.
###1395 Tomorrow, Assistant Secretary Richard and Assistant Administrator Lindborg will go to
###1401 Amman to continue their consultations on the humanitarian situation. And Ambassador Ford
###1408 is going to go to Paris to attend a meeting on assistance to the Syrian opposition that
###1413 the French Government is hosting. It's a - they're calling it a partner support meeting on better
###1419 targeting assistance. I think we'll have a little bit of a announcement right after the
###1425 briefing. One of the things that they are announcing on this trip is an additional $10
###1431 million from the United States, primarily directed at getting flour into the north of
###1440 Syria, into bakeries in Aleppo, where there's a real crying need. And we'll have more on
###1445 that for you later in the day. And then from there, Ambassador Ford goes on to Kuwait for
###1453 the humanitarian assistance meeting.
###1457 QUESTION: In recent days, one of the Syrian groups start petition. It's about this new
###1464 program by the UN revised Humanitarian Assistance Response Plan launched by the United Nations.
###1474 And apparently it's about half a billion dollars, about $519 million. This petition, it says
###1486 that the plan states that it aims at supporting the Government of Syria. So there's a partnership
###1492 with the current Syrian Government to send half a billion humanitarian assistance to
###1501 Syrians. So there is this apparently the problem that how this, the government is going to
###1509 help Syrians while they keep bombing across country.
###1515 MS. NULAND: Well, I don't - I'm not sure what you are looking at there, Ilhan, as your backdrop,
###1522 but the humanitarian aid situation has been difficult and complicated for a long time,
###1531 as you know. UN agencies are required to work with the host government in order to get access
###1540 in the country. And so the UN doesn't have any choice but to continue to pound on the
###1547 Syrian regime to let them get into the most difficult areas. And you know that this is
###1553 not a new problem, particularly when the regime is conducting military operations. And we've
###1562 seen this for more than a year, whether you're talking about Homs or Hama or Aleppo or Damascus.
###1567 So that is one of the constraints. And as we look - as we work with UN agencies, we
###1574 are continually urging them to find new and different ways to get assistance into Syria.
###1583 So that's one problem. But it also speaks to the need to work with nongovernmental organizations
###1590 and others who are in the border states who are able to get assistance directly to Syrians
###1595 who are going back and forth, because sometimes they are able to get access to areas that
###1600 the UN is not.
###1601 QUESTION: I have a bunch of questions on that, but I'm going to - not going to ask today.
###1606 This apparently raises some questions. First of all, the government doesn't have control
###1613 of most of the country. And second, in the past experiences, apparently there is a huge
###1619 corruption. Even the humanitarian aid goes only to places that the regime has control
###1627 over.
###1628 Yesterday, I believe, the president of Syrian coalition said that they need $3 billion for
###1638 a transitional government, to create transitional government. Do you have a comment on that?
###1646 Everybody pressures them to create this transitional government, and they say they - we need $3
###1652 billion to do that.
###1654 MS. NULAND: I hadn't seen that number or those comments either. However, we are in broad
###1660 consultation with the Syrian Opposition Coalition, including at this meeting that the French
###1665 are going to host tomorrow, about moving forward on transitional governing structures, about
###1672 what the needs are going to be, and this is one of the reasons to bring the major donor
###1676 partners together with the SOC.
###1677 QUESTION: Change of subject?
###1678 MS. NULAND: Yeah.
###1679 QUESTION: Can I --
###1680 MS. NULAND: Still on Syria, Jill? No?
###1682 QUESTION: The French also announced that there is a meeting in Paris on the 28th (inaudible).
###1687 Who's representing the United States in that meeting?
###1689 MS. NULAND: I think I just said Ambassador Ford.
###1691 QUESTION: Ambassador Ford - I'm sorry.
###1692 QUESTION: Okay. On Russia, can you tell us --
###1695 MS. NULAND: Still - Scott on Syria.
###1696 QUESTION: One on Syria, sorry.
###1697 MS. NULAND: Yeah.
###1697 QUESTION: Does contact between U.S. officials and the Free Syrian Army include the issue
###1703 of combat between FSA and Kurds?
###1707 MS. NULAND: We are, in our contacts with the FSA, expressing concern about including the
###1718 Kurds in a broader opposition approach, that when opposition groups are in conflict with
###1729 each other, it doesn't help the broader cause of a unified opposition to take the country
###1737 in another - in a more democratic direction. So one of our messages, both to the Kurds
###1745 of Syria all the way through and to other groups in Syria in the opposition, whether
###1750 it's the FSA or whether it's the political opposition, is that their cause is better
###1753 served by unity and common cause. But we are aware of some of these skirmishes that have
###1760 been going on in the north, and we're concerned about it.
###1764 QUESTION: Can we - can I ask you about Russia?
###1767 MS. NULAND: Yeah.
###1767 QUESTION: Can you explain the U.S. decision to end the Civil Society Working Group, a
###1771 U.S.-Russian working group?
###1772 MS. NULAND: As you know, this is a working group that we set up a couple of years ago
###1789 in the interest of exploring how we could support civil society as a key underpinning
###1797 of the U.S.-Russia relationship. We have now decided to withdraw from the Civil Society
###1805 Working Group of the U.S.-Russia Bilateral Presidential Commission in light of recent
###1810 steps taken by the Russian Government which impose really strong restrictions on civil
###1816 society. This working group was a bilateral mechanism that was designed to foster the
###1823 development of civil society, and the United States will continue to work with Russian
###1829 civil society organizations and to help them in their efforts to support the Russian people
###1838 and support their full human rights, their access to healthcare, all of these other kinds
###1843 of things. And we remain committed to a dialogue with the Government of Russia on democracy
###1850 issues and human rights issues, but this particular working group was not working.
###1855 QUESTION: Why is it not better to stay in the working group and try to convince your
###1863 interlocutors there either to try to reverse some of the recent moves that you oppose or
###1871 to do other things that would promote civil society? I mean, did you just come to the
###1875 conclusion that that was never going to happen in this working group?
###1877 MS. NULAND: Well, as I said, the working group was not working. The new restrictions that
###1882 the Government of Russia was placing on civil society in recent months were increasingly
###1887 calling into questions whether maintaining this government-to-government mechanism was
###1892 either useful or appropriate, and it was not advancing the cause of civil society in Russia,
###1898 so we will do that other ways.
###1900 QUESTION: One other thing. Sorry. Just sticking with Russia, I don't know if you are aware
###1907 that the Duma today voted - I think it's 388 to 1 in favor a law that would criminalize
###1917 what it describes as homosexual propaganda and that would allow for - it would ban the
###1928 promotion of gay events across Russia, and it would allow fines of up to 500,000 rubles
###1936 to be imposed on organizers of such events. Do you have any comment on that specifically?
###1942 MS. NULAND: Well, we are aware and we are deeply concerned by this draft legislation
###1946 in Russia that severely restricts freedom of expression and assembly for lesbian, gay,
###1952 bisexual, and transgender individuals and indeed for all Russians. This is similar to
###1958 legislation that already exists in St. Petersburg that we have been expressing our concern about
###1963 including in the Secretary's bilateral meetings with Foreign Minister Lavrov for more than
###1969 a year and in several other regions of Russia.
###1973 We call on Russia as a signatory to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to
###1978 meet its obligations to protect its citizens' rights to peaceful assembly and freedom of
###1983 expression without discrimination. You know how strongly we feel about LGBT rights around
###1990 the world, how strongly the Secretary of State personally feels, that nobody should be discriminated
###1995 against for who they love. I would note that Russian citizens are also concerned. I understand
###2002 that there was a kiss-in outside the Duma today to protest this legislation.
###2008 QUESTION: So Toria, on that, in other words, just getting back to that civil society group
###2015 withdrawal, then we could - from that organization, we can interpret as a protest by the United
###2020 States?
###2020 MS. NULAND: We formed the group in an effort to have government support for the development
###2026 of civil society. Our concern is that what we're seeing from the Russian Government is
###2032 taking the position of civil society in Russia in the wrong direction. So we would rather
###2039 direct our efforts in other ways and continue to work on our direct support for civil society
###2045 organizations who want to work with us.
###2047 QUESTION: And yet direct support now is more difficult than ever.
###2050 MS. NULAND: Absolutely.
###2051 QUESTION: So how do you propose to do that?
###2053 MS. NULAND: Well, we do continue to work with a broad cross-section of Russian civil society
###2058 organizations. They obviously have to manage to do that within their own law. I think you
###2066 know that there are lots of countries where we do this from the United States. We do it
###2071 from offices in third countries. But as long as there are Russian civil society activists
###2078 who want our help, who want our support, who want to connect with civil society organizations
###2083 in the United States, we will help them.
###2086 QUESTION: Can I just ask you, these working groups were established as part of the reset,
###2092 if I remember correctly. And if I remember right, it was this notion that you'd work
###2097 together where you can and talk through differences where they exist. In this case, you're now
###2104 not even going to talk about this central difference of opinion on civil society. So
###2111 what does that say about the reset three, four years on?
###2114 MS. NULAND: Well, let me say that we will obviously continue to talk about human rights,
###2122 we will continue to talk about civil society issues, we will continue to talk about democracy
###2128 in Russia in our bilateral conversations with the Russians at every level from the President
###2133 on down. That's a different matter than whether it makes sense under the Bilateral Presidential
###2139 Commission to have a working group when that working group is not advancing the ball. So
###2148 you'll remember that as part of the reset we established this Presidential Commission
###2153 with lots of different working groups on everything from economy to health to nuclear things to
###2160 many other issues that we work on together. This particular subgroup is not doing what
###2166 we set it out to do, and so we've withdrawn.
###2168 QUESTION: So I suppose the question is: Are the other groups working? Are the other working
###2172 groups working on the different issues you -
###2174 MS. NULAND: Yeah, and in fact, I would - I can't remember when we last - I think it was
###2177 in the context of the President's meeting in - on the margins of his Asia trip with
###2187 President Putin that we released a joint statement that went through the work of many of these
###2193 working groups. I would commend that to you. It was on the White House website.
###2196 QUESTION: Do you see - because we've got this now, you withdrawing from this group on civil
###2201 society, there was the decision towards the back end of last year to - by Moscow to kick
###2210 out USAID. Are these just bumps in the road of your relations with Russia, or is it indicative
###2217 of something much more serious?
###2219 MS. NULAND: Well, I think beyond saying what we've been saying, which is that we will continue
###2227 to work with Russia on as many areas as we can where we see interest in cooperation,
###2233 whether they are bilateral issues, whether they are regional issues, or whether they
###2237 are global issues, but we will also speak straight when we have disagreements, as we
###2243 have, whether it was on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia, whether
###2247 it was on human rights, whether it was on Syria. I don't think it makes sense to try
###2253 to give that relationship a grade. It has always been something that we've both had
###2257 to work hard on, and I think we'll continue to have to do so.
###2261 Please.
###2261 QUESTION: Speaking of USAID, some in Congress now are questioning USAID, demanding information
###2267 on this investigation into a contract that apparently some would allege was steered toward
###2273 a former USAID employee. What can you tell us about that, the status of that right now?
###2282 MS. NULAND: Well, let me first say that my understanding is that this relates to an investigation
###2289 that is still ongoing, so I am quite constrained in what I can say in terms of discussing the
###2297 details. What I will say is from this building, we are confident that the investigation has
###2304 not been compromised, and that USAID has cooperated with the investigation. But I think we have
###2310 to wait until it's completed.
###2312 QUESTION: What do you mean you're confident that the investigation has not been compromised?
###2315 MS. NULAND: There were some concerns about that, and I would just like to affirm here
###2320 that it is our view that it has not been compromised.
###2323 QUESTION: And are you confident that the employees that - who are alleged to be under investigation,
###2334 or are reported to be under investigation, acted properly?
###2337 MS. NULAND: I'm not in a position to make that judgment in the middle of an investigation.
###2342 That's why the investigation is ongoing.
###2343 QUESTION: And when you - last thing - when you refer to the investigation, you are indeed
###2347 referring to the Justice Department investigation into this, correct, not into an IG investigation
###2354 or a congressional investigation?
###2355 MS. NULAND: My understanding is we were talking about an IG investigation. I don't know what
###2359 else you would be talking about.
###2360 QUESTION: The AP reported yesterday that the Justice Department is conducting a criminal
###2365 investigation into possible contract-rigging by the general counsel at USAID.
###2372 MS. NULAND: What I have pertains to an IG investigation. If we have anything more on
###2377 that or how they might link, I'll get back to you.
###2379 QUESTION: Victoria.
###2380 MS. NULAND: Yeah.
###2380 QUESTION: You said you didn't want to give the relationship with Russia a grade. I mean,
###2385 why not? How do you evaluate your relationship with Russia? I mean, the President spoke of
###2390 a reset policy, I think, at the time, provided that Russia cooperates with you on a number
###2398 of issues. So when do you know that the situation or the relationship is so tense that you cannot
###2403 cooperate?
###2403 MS. NULAND: I don't think it's useful in any context to be giving grades unless you're
###2408 in high school or elementary school. I think I have enough of that at home.
###2409 QUESTION: No, I don't mean a grade, per se, but how do you say - how do you put a status
###2415 on that relationship?
###2415 MS. NULAND: Said, I think I spoke to the general principles that undergird the relationship.
###2419 QUESTION: (Off-mike.)
###2420 MS. NULAND: Yeah, go ahead.
###2421 QUESTION: Firstly, we had a story a few days ago on Saeed Abedini, this U.S. citizen jailed
###2427 in Iran, reporting that he might get bail. Do you have any information on that and on
###2433 his status?
###2434 MS. NULAND: We remain very concerned about U.S. citizen Saeed Abedini, who is detained
###2439 in Iran on charges related to his religious beliefs. Mr. Abedini's attorney had only one
###2445 day to present his defense. And we remain deeply concerned about the fairness and the
###2450 transparency of his trial. We condemn Iran's continued violation of the universal rights
###2456 of freedom of religion, and we call on the Iranian authorities to respect Mr. Abedini's
###2461 human rights and to release him. We are in close contact with his family as well and
###2466 we're actively engaged in the case.
###2468 QUESTION: So no indication that he was let out on bail as, I think it was, this Iranian
###2474 news agency seemed to suggest that might be --
###2476 MS. NULAND: I don't have any positive news to report on this, unfortunately.
###2479 QUESTION: Okay. And then on another issue, there's been some reports about a mysterious
###2486 gold transfer that seemed to have made its way from Ghana to Turkey, had a brief pause
###2493 there, then to Dubai, and then to Iran. Do you know anything about this, and do you know
###2498 what it means?
###2500 MS. NULAND: I don't appear to have much on this other than to say that we continue to
###2506 consult closely with Turkey and on all countries regarding the scope of U.S. sanctions against
###2513 Iran, and we will pursue any evidence of sanctionable transactions. But I don't have anything on
###2519 this particular set of alleged circumstances.
###2521 QUESTION: You haven't had any discussions with Turkey specifically on this?
###2524 MS. NULAND: I don't have anything to share on that one way or the other.
###2527 QUESTION: Okay.
###2528 QUESTION: Staying in the region, Iraq?
###2529 MS. NULAND: Yeah.
###2530 QUESTION: A very quick question: According to reports, five protestors got killed today
###2536 in Fallujah, Iraq. Have - are you able to confirm - during protests by the Iraqi security
###2545 forces.
###2545 MS. NULAND: I'm not in a position to confirm numbers, but I will say that we are concerned
###2551 about the use of deadly force during today's protests in Iraq. We understand that the Iraqi
###2557 Government has now issued a statement indicating that they are initiating a very prompt investigation
###2562 into the incidents, and that they have called for restraint by security forces. We obviously
###2567 stand ready to assist in that investigation if asked, but we would also say that as the
###2576 government and government forces show restraint, the demonstrators also have a responsibility
###2580 to exercise their right to protest in a nonviolent manner, as well as to continue to press their
###2586 demands through the political process.
###2588 QUESTION: On Mali?
###2590 MS. NULAND: Please. Arshad.
###2593 QUESTION: I have two (inaudible).
###2597 MS. NULAND: Yeah.
###2598 QUESTION: One is: We have a report saying that P-5+1 talks with the Iranians that had
###2599 hoped to be held next week are actually likely now to slide into February. Do you have anything
###2608 on that?
###2609 MS. NULAND: Other than to say we are continuing to consult with the Iranians to determine
###2615 dates and a venue, unfortunately I don't. We've been surprised that the Iranians keep
###2624 coming back again and again with new preconditions, new dates and venues. And we haven't been
###2628 able to settle yet, but we're going to keep trying.
###2630 QUESTION: They've been coming back with substantive preconditions or with date and venue-related
###2635 preconditions?
###2635 MS. NULAND: They've been coming back with preconditions on the modalities for the talks.
###2640 We're not to the point of substance yet; we're still trying to figure out when and where.
###2645 QUESTION: And then one other one: We have reported that South Korean petrochemical company
###2652 Samsung Total Petrochemicals has revived a contract to buy Iranian oil after more than
###2661 a year of not buying any. And it appears that the reason they have done so is that they're
###2667 getting the oil pretty cheaply. I realize that the NDAA sanctions refer to purchases
###2674 by a country as a whole and not individual companies, but are you troubled by the - by
###2684 this, by the prospect that one of our ally's oil companies, after stopping buying Iranian
###2689 oil, is now starting up again?
###2692 MS. NULAND: Arshad, let me take that one because I need to check on whether our facts and yours
###2698 are the same and how we would react.
###2699 Please.
###2699 QUESTION: On Mali?
###2700 MS. NULAND: Mali, yeah.
###2702 QUESTION: There have been increasingly harsher tones coming out of Paris both from the President,
###2707 President Hollande, and the Defense Minister with regard to the determination of the French
###2713 of going further to clean up this situation in Mali, whereas initially it was seen on
###2718 the French side as a temporary operation by French troops which would be replaced by these
###2724 ECOWAS. The French were not so inclined to get deeply involved in Francophone Africa
###2730 for obvious reasons. They are treated like heroes, people are putting out French flags,
###2736 but that's not going to last forever if the French remain a long time.
###2739 Now, after the statements of Prime Minister Cameron, the intervention, I think, of the
###2745 EU is going to get involved in this. This looks like it's going to be a much longer
###2749 war and more serious operation. What is the U.S. view of the situation as it's developing
###2755 in Mali?
###2756 MS. NULAND: Well, let me just commend to you some of the comments that the Secretary made
###2762 during her Benghazi hearings with regard to the challenge that we are all having to confront,
###2770 not only in Mali but in the entire region. I think she obviously spoke quite eloquently
###2777 about the challenge; that it's not only a security challenge but it's also a challenge
###2782 of governance and democracy and values. Our understanding of the ground situation is that
###2790 French and Malian forces have been able to have some success in recent days. We talked
###2796 about Diabali the other day and Kona. They are now taking up positions in the city of
###2803 Menaka, which is just to the east of Gao, and moving up into Gao and Timbuktu.
###2809 But you're not wrong that the strategy here depends on both Malian and ECOWAS forces being
###2818 able to come in behind, secure the gains, not only hold them but extend them, and also
###2825 prepare the country for a restoration of democracy through elections this spring. So in that
###2832 context, as you know, in addition to supporting some of the French requests, we are focusing
###2838 our efforts on facilitating the ECOWAS forces, the AFISMA forces to get into Mali. Our understanding
###2846 is that there are currently some 600 AFISMA troops in Mali, including 44 African staff
###2852 at ECOWAS headquarters. We've got 162 from Nigeria, 50 from Benin, 204 from Togo, 36
###2859 from Senegal, 159 from Burkina. And we have some 500-plus Nigerian troops on the Niger
###2867 border getting ready to go in.
###2870 The U.S. is also, as we've been talking about, using our ACOTA facility to work with Niger,
###2879 Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Senegal, Togo, Ghana in the coming weeks to ensure that they can
###2885 sustain and continue these deployments, and with longer-term training in terms of what'll
###2892 be necessary to not only come in behind the French, but also to train and support the
###2899 Malian forces in eventually being able to secure their country themselves.
###2902 QUESTION: Your what facility? You said our --
###2905 MS. NULAND: Our ACOTA facility, which we've talked about before. I'll see if I've got
###2908 it written out here - the African Contingency Operations Training and Assistance program.
###2913 I think I'm going to - we're going to put out a fact sheet shortly on ACOTA. Yeah.
###2918 QUESTION: There's a P missing from the acronym at the end.
###2922 MS. NULAND: Is there?
###2922 QUESTION: Anyhow.
###2922 MS. NULAND: African Contingency Operations Training and Assistance, ACOTA.
###2925 QUESTION: Okay.
###2926 QUESTION: Staying - just moving slightly in the region, on Algeria, has there been any
###2933 contact since the end of the hostage crisis between the Algerian authorities and the State
###2939 Department to update you on how the attack at the oil facility took place, and their
###2946 subsequent - the subsequent decisions that were made by the Algerian authorities in handling
###2952 the situation and releasing the hostages?
###2954 MS. NULAND: Well, we are, obviously, in close contact with the Algerians, including via
###2960 Ambassador Ensher on the ground there. I think I mentioned that we have an open FBI investigation
###2966 now, so I'm not going to get into details, as that moves forward. But we, like the Algerians,
###2971 are obviously looking to get a full understanding of exactly how this transpired and what the
###2977 motives were and who was involved so that they can be brought to justice.
###2980 QUESTION: So that understanding hasn't evolved since we spoke on Tuesday?
###2982 MS. NULAND: I don't have anything to share. It certainly has evolved, but you understand
###2987 that once these things become a matter of investigation, there's very - not a lot we
###2990 can say until the investigations are complete.
###2992 QUESTION: New subject, ma'am?
###2994 MS. NULAND: Goyal quickly, and then we'll go to Scott, and poor old Dana that was way
###2998 in the back and I missed her.
###2999 Okay, go ahead.
###3000 QUESTION: New subject?
###3000 MS. NULAND: Yeah.
###3001 QUESTION: My question is the Chicago courts on India. As Indians celebrate the Republic
###3006 Day of India tomorrow, and India is shocked and Indians are very angry as far as the Chicago
###3013 court's outcomes are concerned for Mr. Rana last week, only 14 years, what they are saying,
###3020 and now yesterday, 35 years for David Coleman Headley.
###3026 Now, what they are saying is this is the price of - cost of the 166 people killed in Mumbai
###3036 attacks, and including six Americans. And what Indians are really saying, that why this
###3043 has happened - only 35 years, but why he was not extradited to India to face justice, because
###3050 U.S. and India both believes in - that anyone who - criminals must face justice?
###3058 MS. NULAND: Let me just underscore what the Justice Department announced when this trial
###3065 completed - it was completed. David Headley, a key conspirator in the Mumbai terrorist
###3072 attacks, has been brought to justice in the United States. He will serve 35 years in prison
###3078 for his role in these heinous acts that claimed the lives of 166 people, including six Americans.
###3084 He also gave - the investigation and the prosecution of David Headley stems from the unprecedented
###3093 and intense collaboration between the United States and Indian authorities in the counterterrorism
###3100 sphere to bring all the people responsible for Mumbai to justice.
###3105 Let me just add, and I would commend to you the fact sheet put out by our Embassy in Delhi
###3112 and the comments made by the Justice Department yesterday, not only did he stand trial, face
###3118 conviction, now have to serve 35 years. But in the context of this prosecution, Mr. Headley
###3123 provided information of substantial value in our efforts against terrorism, including
###3129 testifying against co-conspirator Mr. Rana, providing extensive detail about accused terrorist
###3138 Kashmiri and his network, who was indicted in 2009, as you know, and as well as submitting
###3144 to questions from Indian law enforcement and working with U.S. investigators.
###3149 So from our perspective, justice was served, and this is a very positive example of U.S.-Indian
###3155 collaboration in the counterterrorism realm.
###3157 QUESTION: Madam, what message would be from the Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to
###3161 the people, or the victims of 166 people and their loved ones, and including six Americans
###3167 on this day?
###3168 MS. NULAND: That we promised that justice would be served, that justice is being served
###3172 in this case.
###3173 Please, Scott.
###3175 QUESTION: On the same subject --
###3176 MS. NULAND: Scott. Yeah, sorry. Go ahead.
###3179 QUESTION: So the two ministers, Indian ministers, expressed concern that they wanted to keep
###3183 up the effort to extradite him. Are you continuing to that dialogue, or is this just a matter
###3190 of - because of the U.S. legal system, this is a closed, locked door that they're banging
###3195 at?
###3196 MS. NULAND: The Justice Department spoke to this. He's been tried, convicted, and will
###3199 serve in the United States.
###3200 Scott?
###3200 QUESTION: Well, just quickly --
###3201 MS. NULAND: Scott - I think we're - I think we've done this one.
###3203 Scott?
###3203 QUESTION: Azerbaijan.
###3203 MS. NULAND: Yeah.
###3203 QUESTION: Do you have anything? There's been some instability in Ismaili. There was a warning
###3208 for U.S. citizens. But do you have anything more specific to talk about the violence in
###3214 Azerbaijan, police response?
###3215 MS. NULAND: Let me take that one as well, Scott, and we'll get to you.
###3218 Dana.
###3218 QUESTION: I have two unrelated questions. The first is a follow-up to Mali, and I'm
###3222 wondering about the funding for ACOTA and these troops. Has the State Department asked
###3230 Congress for more money beyond the initial $8 million that was allocated, and how much?
###3236 MS. NULAND: We have, Dana. We have the 8 million that we already had, and then we've just notified
###3242 Congress either yesterday or today requesting an additional 32 million for the ACOTA effort,
###3248 and we will continue to evaluate what more we might need as we work with our African
###3253 partners.
###3253 QUESTION: And secondly, I just wondered if you would be able to confirm that the specialty
###3258 glasses that the Secretary is wearing have a Fresnel prism in them, or how long she's
###3265 expected to wear the glasses.
###3267 MS. NULAND: Well, let me just say in response to lots of speculation, the Secretary is going
###3275 to be wearing the glasses instead of her contacts for some period of time because of lingering
###3280 issues that stemmed from her concussion. She sees just fine with them, and she also enjoyed
###3288 some of the comments she saw in the press about the extra sort of diplomatic lift she
###3294 gets from gesturing with them. So - all right?
###3298 QUESTION: May I just --
###3299 MS. NULAND: Thank you very much. I think we've gone a long while here, Goyal. Thanks.
###3301 QUESTION: Thank you.
###3301 MS. NULAND: All right.
