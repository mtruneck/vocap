1
0:0:2,85 --> 0:0:4,9
(Roxanne Meadows) Here in the Venus Project


2
0:0:4,9 --> 0:0:7,96
we present tours on scheduled Saturdays


3
0:0:7,96 --> 0:0:11,86
in Venus, Florida; which is in central Florida.


4
0:0:11,86 --> 0:0:15,55
People come from all over the world to hear Jacque speak


5
0:0:15,55 --> 0:0:18,75
about a very different value system


6
0:0:18,75 --> 0:0:22,77
as to how we relate to ourselves and one another.


7
0:0:22,77 --> 0:0:27,98
Everything you do seems to be related to some experience.


8
0:0:27,98 --> 0:0:30,28
If you have free will it means


9
0:0:30,28 --> 0:0:34,3
you're acting without anything impressing you.


10
0:0:34,3 --> 0:0:36,49
That doesn't seem possible.


11
0:0:36,49 --> 0:0:40,51
(R.M.) Jacque gives us a better understanding on how we are a part of nature


12
0:0:40,51 --> 0:0:43,62
not separate from it.


13
0:0:43,62 --> 0:0:45,78
He also explains what it means


14
0:0:45,78 --> 0:0:50,14
to apply the scientific method to our everyday life


15
0:0:50,14 --> 0:0:53,11
enabling us to dispense with folkways


16
0:0:53,11 --> 0:0:57,47
opinions and speculative notions.


17
0:0:57,47 --> 0:1:1,32
(Jacque) If I know a machine can't feel, I won't take part in it.


18
0:1:1,32 --> 0:1:4,38
When this thing makes drawings, people weep


19
0:1:4,38 --> 0:1:8,81
at the characters in the drawings if they get hurt.


20
0:1:8,81 --> 0:1:13,52
They will respond to drawings and they are not real.


21
0:1:13,52 --> 0:1:17,27
People do not respond to the world they live in.


22
0:1:17,27 --> 0:1:20,23
They respond as your nation programs you to.


23
0:1:20,23 --> 0:1:24,53
(R.M.) Tours can go on for many hours and sometimes even into the evening


24
0:1:24,53 --> 0:1:28,915
as Jacque replies to the many questions that people have.


25
0:1:28,915 --> 0:1:31,29
There is a long discussion about the aims


26
0:1:31,29 --> 0:1:34,1
and direction of the Venus Project [and]


27
0:1:34,1 --> 0:1:37,49
a walk through the ground into the model buildings


28
0:1:37,49 --> 0:1:41,76
with the descriptions of hundreds of models and renderings.


29
0:1:41,76 --> 0:1:45,39
There will be a short film shown which will give you a better understanding


30
0:1:45,39 --> 0:1:47,71
of this possible future vision.


31
0:1:47,71 --> 0:1:50,59
That's what the Venus project is: What to do about it!


32
0:1:50,59 --> 0:1:52,95
It is not enough to criticize your country


33
0:1:52,95 --> 0:1:55,28
if you don't offer an alternative.


34
0:1:55,28 --> 0:1:59,8
(R.M.) I think that the tours of the Venus Project will awaken people


35
0:1:59,8 --> 0:2:2,29
to many facets that they are not aware of.


36
0:2:2,29 --> 0:2:5,15
It's a way of thinking that differs considerably


37
0:2:5,15 --> 0:2:8,54
from what you get at universities today.


38
0:2:8,54 --> 0:2:11,18
It's a different form of psychology.


39
0:2:11,18 --> 0:2:15,67
It's applied behavioral science to the social system.


40
0:2:15,67 --> 0:2:18,73
I think you'll learn a great deal through the tour.


41
0:2:18,73 --> 0:2:22,7
Not only through the tour of the property


42
0:2:22,7 --> 0:2:25,41
but with the explanation of this way of thinking.


43
0:2:25,41 --> 0:2:31,46
It's something that many people have been in search of for years.


44
0:2:31,46 --> 0:2:33,36
The tour is incredible


45
0:2:33,36 --> 0:2:37,5
and it's something that people all over


46
0:2:37,5 --> 0:2:39,65
that I personally know, are completely looking for.


47
0:2:39,65 --> 0:2:42,18
I got so many wonderful things out of the tour.


48
0:2:42,18 --> 0:2:44,71
I couldn't have expected how good it was going to be.


49
0:2:44,71 --> 0:2:50,13
It was a wonderful opportunity to meet Jacque and Roxanne.


50
0:2:50,13 --> 0:2:52,33
To meet all the people around here is nice


51
0:2:52,33 --> 0:2:54,16
and to be able to ask some questions.


52
0:2:54,16 --> 0:2:57,1
You can find a lot of the stuff online and hear a lot of the lectures


53
0:2:57,1 --> 0:2:59,69
but nothing compares to actually coming here


54
0:2:59,69 --> 0:3:2,9
and seeing it for yourself in person.


55
0:3:2,9 --> 0:3:4,97
I definitely got more out of it than I knew before.


56
0:3:4,97 --> 0:3:7,61
And to see the structures in the complex


57
0:3:7,61 --> 0:3:10,32
which are also very interesting and very admirable.


58
0:3:10,32 --> 0:3:13,54
Looking at all the models was great. It was fantastic.


59
0:3:13,54 --> 0:3:17,15
I got a really strong sense that


60
0:3:17,15 --> 0:3:20,55
all these ideas, all these transitions to the Resource-Based Economy


61
0:3:20,55 --> 0:3:24,58
are actually totally within reach.


62
0:3:24,58 --> 0:3:26,71
The six hours that we have been here...


63
0:3:26,71 --> 0:3:29,69
there was a lot more emphasis on the little things that I have heard.


64
0:3:29,69 --> 0:3:33,53
He's got so much knowledge and not enough time to give it all out.


65
0:3:33,53 --> 0:3:36,38
Jacque is a brilliant mind!


66
0:3:36,38 --> 0:3:38,84
We're going to remember him for centuries.


67
0:3:38,84 --> 0:3:42,13
This is a very precious time for us to have Jacque around


68
0:3:42,13 --> 0:3:44,11
and actually to be able to listen to


69
0:3:44,11 --> 0:3:48,32
how much he understands the depth and breadth


70
0:3:48,32 --> 0:3:52,18
of how powerful this message really is.


71
0:3:52,18 --> 0:3:53,79
Take advantage of the opportunity.


72
0:3:53,79 --> 0:3:57,74
I think I need at least a week to be here because there is so much


73
0:3:57,74 --> 0:4:2,2
with everything they have here; it has exceeded my expectations.


74
0:4:2,2 --> 0:4:5,33
A great tour!


75
0:4:5,33 --> 0:4:6,9
It was an incredible experience.


76
0:4:6,9 --> 0:4:9,65
I know I will definitely never forget this. -Definitely.


77
0:4:9,65 --> 0:4:13,7
Probably even come back. Definitely! Definitely!


78
0:4:13,7 --> 0:4:15,34
I definitely want to come back.


79
0:4:15,34 --> 0:4:19,47
As we become able to understand it better


80
0:4:19,47 --> 0:4:21,37
then we can be the message as well


81
0:4:21,37 --> 0:4:23,61
and I think this is what we really need to do.


82
0:4:23,61 --> 0:4:27,31
I feel like I've got a lot of hope


83
0:4:27,31 --> 0:6:27,31
for the future actually manifesting in a way that is better than ever.
