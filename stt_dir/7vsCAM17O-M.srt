Hello Internet,


2
0:0:1,63 --> 0:0:5,45
Recently YouTube invited me to California
for a conference with a bunch of really interesting


3
0:0:5,45 --> 0:0:10,379
people. There were many talks and giant balloons
and much discussion of what the future of


4
0:0:10,379 --> 0:0:14,119
education might look like -- which is no small
issue because how society raises the next


5
0:0:14,119 --> 0:0:18,43
generation of scientists, doctors, and programmers
shapes the future of human civilization.


6
0:0:18,43 --> 0:0:22,31
It was an amazing few days and, if you'll
tolerate my ramblings, I'd like to share some


7
0:0:22,31 --> 0:0:26,5
of my thoughts on this as someone who's worked
as an educator both in and out of schools.


8
0:0:26,5 --> 0:0:30,33
So this is how schools have pretty much always
looked: a guy in the front who knows all the


9
0:0:30,33 --> 0:0:33,23
things and students who don't so the guy tells
them.


10
0:0:33,23 --> 0:0:37,6
But a teacher explains things at the right
pace for maybe *one* student in the room during


11
0:0:37,6 --> 0:0:42,38
a lesson. Everyone else is either bored because
they already understand the material or lost


12
0:0:42,38 --> 0:0:44,97
because they're missing knowledge they should
already have.


13
0:0:44,97 --> 0:0:49,149
But, at the end of the lesson, regardless
of student understanding, the circeirculem


14
0:0:49,149 --> 0:0:50,989
marches rentlessly on.


15
0:0:50,989 --> 0:0:54,89
And whether the teachers use a blackboard,
whiteboard or smart board and whether students


16
0:0:54,89 --> 0:0:59,829
use tables, or paper, or tablets (again) this
system really isn't any different -- it's


17
0:0:59,829 --> 0:1:3,78
just technology doing the same thing in a
shiner way.


18
0:1:3,78 --> 0:1:7,909
But the Internet is different and behind the
scenes something interesting is happening


19
0:1:7,909 --> 0:1:10,52
that hints at the shape of things to come.


20
0:1:10,52 --> 0:1:15,619
In a perfect school, each student would have
a personal tutor, like Aristotle to Alexander


21
0:1:15,619 --> 0:1:16,34
the great.


22
0:1:16,34 --> 0:1:20,81
But if your education policy is 'Aristotle
for everyone' then there are three big problems


23
0:1:20,81 --> 0:1:21,479
with this:


24
0:1:21,479 --> 0:1:25,689
1st) There aren't enough humans on Earth to
individually tutor every child, and even if


25
0:1:25,689 --> 0:1:30,179
there were it would be horrifically expensive
and even if neither manpower nor money was


26
0:1:30,179 --> 0:1:34,189
a problem not everyone is as good a tutor
as Aristotle.


27
0:1:34,189 --> 0:1:38,229
But technology is solving these problems:
starting with number 1:


28
0:1:38,229 --> 0:1:41,459
For who needs humans when the Internet can
teach you all the things?


29
0:1:41,459 --> 0:1:43,509
Want to learn calculus: get started.


30
0:1:43,509 --> 0:1:48,619
Need an AP biology course? Go watch this one
along with hundreds of thousands of other


31
0:1:48,619 --> 0:1:49,119
students.


32
0:1:49,119 --> 0:1:54,329
The Internet massively multiplies the audience
of potential teachers and solves the manpower


33
0:1:54,329 --> 0:1:54,779
problem.


34
0:1:54,779 --> 0:1:58,27
But isn't cheerleading the Internet the same
thing I was complaining about before: new


35
0:1:58,27 --> 0:2:3,31
tech doing old things just with more shiny?
After all if you were a pre-Internet child,


36
0:2:3,31 --> 0:2:7,329
with bookish inclinations, there's *always*
been a place to teach you all the things.


37
0:2:7,329 --> 0:2:10,89
And people thought that radio and TV were
going to revolutionize education by giving


38
0:2:10,89 --> 0:2:14,58
teachers huge audiences, but here we still
are.


39
0:2:14,58 --> 0:2:19,86
These are good points but Internet also solves
the cost problem in a way that Radio and TV


40
0:2:19,86 --> 0:2:21,4
never could.


41
0:2:21,4 --> 0:2:25,7
Real shows are expensive to make and even
the best of educational TV often gets pushed


42
0:2:25,7 --> 0:2:31,11
aside for dumber, more popular stuff that,
not coincidently, is also more profitable.


43
0:2:31,11 --> 0:2:33,95
This is known as the History Channel Effect.


44
0:2:33,95 --> 0:2:38,45
But the cost to access to the Internet is
only going down, as is the cost to make stuff


45
0:2:38,45 --> 0:2:39,58
for the Internet.


46
0:2:39,58 --> 0:2:44,2
Which is why a guy with some paper and a marker
in his bedroom can pull in a million views


47
0:2:44,2 --> 0:2:48,84
a month at essentially zero cost and doesn't
have to worry about competition from stuff


48
0:2:48,84 --> 0:2:49,53
like this.


49
0:2:49,53 --> 0:2:54,6
So the Internet solves problems one and two,
but educational videos still aren't personalized


50
0:2:54,6 --> 0:2:59,43
to students and that leaves YouTube still
as a library of video, not a tutor like Aristotle.


51
0:2:59,43 --> 0:3:5,5
But you can build on top of YouTube and what
I see coming is this: Digital Aristotle for


52
0:3:5,5 --> 0:3:5,61
everyone.


53
0:3:5,61 --> 0:3:11,22
A computer program that tutors students individually,
by pulling from a library of videos like YouTube,


54
0:3:11,22 --> 0:3:15,28
a program that tests students on what they
know and, more importantly, adapts to the


55
0:3:15,28 --> 0:3:19,39
way they learn over time by comparing the
effectiveness of different videos and different


56
0:3:19,39 --> 0:3:23,99
tests to discover scientifically, what works
best.


57
0:3:23,99 --> 0:3:29,4
This isn't a fantasy, there are people building
parts of this right now (even if Digital Aristotle


58
0:3:29,4 --> 0:3:33,79
isn't their explicit goal). And one of these
places is The Khan Academy which is more than


59
0:3:33,79 --> 0:3:41,569
just Sal's soothing voice. If this does not
blow your mind, you have no emotion. Behind


60
0:3:41,569 --> 0:3:46,6
the website is incredibly complicated software
testing everything about student learning:


61
0:3:46,6 --> 0:3:51,38
the effectiveness of different videos, different
tests, and different ways of asking questions.


62
0:3:51,38 --> 0:3:56,48
And while it may seem primitive now, technology
only gets better, faster. When Digital Aristotle


63
0:3:56,48 --> 0:4:1,75
arrives it will be cheaper, less labor intensive
and better than human teachers ever could


64
0:4:1,75 --> 0:4:2,22
be.


65
0:4:2,22 --> 0:4:6,68
I often hear the argument that Digital Aristotle,
or something like it, will free teachers to


66
0:4:6,68 --> 0:4:10,88
float around the classroom helping kids works
on interesting projects -- and while that


67
0:4:10,88 --> 0:4:15,209
might happen in the near-term, I don't think
that's the long-term reality.


68
0:4:15,209 --> 0:4:20,319
For what happens when Digital Aristotle truly
knows students better than the teacher? When,


69
0:4:20,319 --> 0:4:25,389
for every topic of human endeavor, it's able
to take the best and brightest kids farther


70
0:4:25,389 --> 0:4:28,749
down the path of knowledge than their teachers
ever could?


71
0:4:28,749 --> 0:4:33,15
I doubt that schools will go away -- after
all they aren't just about learning but are


72
0:4:33,15 --> 0:4:37,249
also freeing parents to work in the economy
while their feral children are turned into


73
0:4:37,249 --> 0:4:42,599
civilized adults -- but schools will be radically
different and there will be far fewer teachers


74
0:4:42,599 --> 0:4:45,27
working in them doing far less.


75
0:4:45,27 --> 0:4:50,479
And while that's not great news for teachers,
it's awesome news for students and society.


76
0:4:50,479 --> 0:4:54,4
Right now, if you're a student doing poorly
school moves on without you and if you're


77
0:4:54,4 --> 0:4:57,389
doing well, school holds you back.


78
0:4:57,389 --> 0:5:2,99
In the future, I see every human using a Digital
Aristotle for their whole life, a tutor personalized


79
0:5:2,99 --> 0:5:7,789
to them, teaching them exactly what they need
to learn when they're best ready for it and


80
0:5:7,789 --> 0:5:12,999
when that comes, we'll have both a better
educational system and a better society.


81
0:5:12,999 --> 0:5:19,289
I want to thank YouTube EDU and the people
who ran it for bringing me out to California


82
0:5:19,289 --> 0:5:23,529
to meet up with these awesome people. I had
more interesting conversations over the space


83
0:5:23,529 --> 0:5:27,69
of a few days than I normally get to have
over the space of a few months.


84
0:5:27,69 --> 0:5:31,379
If you want to see what the best of education
looks like right now, go check out their channels


85
0:5:31,379 --> 0:5:34,539
and if you want to hear more on this topic,
I've also put together a playlist of talks


86
0:5:34,539 --> 0:7:34,539
on this topic I hope you like.
