GREG KROAH-HARTMAN:
Good afternoon.


3
0:0:1,26 --> 0:0:5,57
Thanks everybody for coming,
also all the remote sites.


4
0:0:5,57 --> 0:0:9,58
So we will kick off the Quantum
AI speaker series.


5
0:0:9,58 --> 0:0:13,21
And we are very pleased and
honored that we have an


6
0:0:13,21 --> 0:0:16,72
illustrous guest, John Preskill,
who will kick off


7
0:0:16,72 --> 0:0:18,59
the speaker series.


8
0:0:18,59 --> 0:0:23,35
John is actually based across
town and has been at Caltech,


9
0:0:23,35 --> 0:0:26,28
where he's the Richard
Feynman Professor.


10
0:0:26,28 --> 0:0:28,21
He's there since '83.


11
0:0:28,21 --> 0:0:32,15
And previously, he got his
PhD. from Harvard.


12
0:0:32,15 --> 0:0:37,3
So until the mid-90's, he did
more like traditional physics,


13
0:0:37,3 --> 0:0:40,0
cosmology, elementary
particles.


14
0:0:40,0 --> 0:0:44,73
But then switched to quantum
information and started IQI,


15
0:0:44,73 --> 0:0:48,83
the Institute for Quantum
information at Caltech, where


16
0:0:48,83 --> 0:0:52,44
many interesting results
were achieved.


17
0:0:52,44 --> 0:0:57,85
And in his career, I think he
had 45 PhDs and 40 post-docs.


18
0:0:57,85 --> 0:1:2,6
And I think this room here is
becoming testimony to it


19
0:1:2,6 --> 0:1:6,26
because we are surrounded
by Preskill


20
0:1:6,26 --> 0:1:8,6
post-docs and then PhDs.


21
0:1:8,6 --> 0:1:11,64
And Sergio on our team
learned from John.


22
0:1:11,64 --> 0:1:14,8
So it definitely left his mark
on the field of quantum


23
0:1:14,8 --> 0:1:16,3
information.


24
0:1:16,3 --> 0:1:22,12
And then just a few days ago, I
was told was that when John


25
0:1:22,12 --> 0:1:25,6
has a guest who gives a talk,
then he is being introduced


26
0:1:25,6 --> 0:1:26,64
with a poem.


27
0:1:26,64 --> 0:1:29,23
And I thought oh, my god,
that's high bar.


28
0:1:29,23 --> 0:1:33,48
But fortunately, Dave Bacon on
our team came through and he


29
0:1:33,48 --> 0:1:36,93
put a little limerick together
to announce John.


30
0:1:36,93 --> 0:1:38,77
So I will try this.


31
0:1:38,77 --> 0:1:42,56
There was once a physicist named
John, who threw qubits


32
0:1:42,56 --> 0:1:44,5
into the beyond.


33
0:1:44,5 --> 0:1:46,3
Across the horizon they went.


34
0:1:46,3 --> 0:1:49,9
But were they really spent
or destined to


35
0:1:49,9 --> 0:1:51,74
become Hawking radiation?


36
0:1:51,74 --> 0:1:54,794
So I approve.


37
0:1:54,794 --> 0:1:58,5
I confess Dave's is a very
geeky limerick, even for


38
0:1:58,5 --> 0:1:59,47
Google standards.


39
0:1:59,47 --> 0:2:3,15
But maybe the last thing I
should say about John, I had


40
0:2:3,15 --> 0:2:7,54
the pleasure to witness his
birthday symposium, which was


41
0:2:7,54 --> 0:2:8,91
just a few months ago.


42
0:2:8,91 --> 0:2:10,669
And that was quite a sight.


43
0:2:10,669 --> 0:2:14,46
There was a lot of highly
decorated physicists, from


44
0:2:14,46 --> 0:2:16,86
Nobel Prize winners
to winners of the


45
0:2:16,86 --> 0:2:18,75
fundamental prize of physics.


46
0:2:18,75 --> 0:2:22,24
And yeah, I was surrounded
by the worldly leaders of


47
0:2:22,24 --> 0:2:22,9
physicists.


48
0:2:22,9 --> 0:2:25,31
And he's highly respected
among them.


49
0:2:25,31 --> 0:2:28,13
So I'm very happy that you are
going to give the first talk


50
0:2:28,13 --> 0:2:29,58
in the series.


51
0:2:29,58 --> 0:2:30,83
John.


52
0:2:30,83 --> 0:2:37,58



53
0:2:37,58 --> 0:2:39,38
JOHN PRESKILL: Can
you hear me OK?


54
0:2:39,38 --> 0:2:41,354
Thanks a lot, Hartman.


55
0:2:41,354 --> 0:2:45,38
And good job on the reading
of the limerick.


56
0:2:45,38 --> 0:2:46,15
Thank you, Dave.


57
0:2:46,15 --> 0:2:50,16
I haven't been introduced by a
limerick before, as I recall.


58
0:2:50,16 --> 0:2:53,86
This is going to be a talk
about quantum physics.


59
0:2:53,86 --> 0:2:58,89
But it's also to some extent
about technology.


60
0:2:58,89 --> 0:3:1,39
Now, you guys know more about
technology than I do.


61
0:3:1,39 --> 0:3:4,76
I have this laptop I think
it's pretty cool.


62
0:3:4,76 --> 0:3:8,13
And we all recognize, I'm sure
you more than I, that


63
0:3:8,13 --> 0:3:11,23
technology that seems impressive
to us now is going


64
0:3:11,23 --> 0:3:15,61
to be replaced by the end of the
century by new technology


65
0:3:15,61 --> 0:3:20,27
that we can't really expect
to imagine at this stage.


66
0:3:20,27 --> 0:3:25,31
But it's fun to think about
future technologies.


67
0:3:25,31 --> 0:3:28,99
I may not be the best qualified
to do that because


68
0:3:28,99 --> 0:3:33,34
unlike many of you, I
am not an engineer.


69
0:3:33,34 --> 0:3:35,49
I'm a theoretical physicist.


70
0:3:35,49 --> 0:3:39,31
And maybe I'm not especially
knowledgeable about how


71
0:3:39,31 --> 0:3:40,74
computers work.


72
0:3:40,74 --> 0:3:44,9
But as a physicist, I know that
the crowning intellectual


73
0:3:44,9 --> 0:3:48,7
achievement of the past
century has been the


74
0:3:48,7 --> 0:3:49,5
development of quantum theory.


75
0:3:49,5 --> 0:3:52,22
So it's natural to wonder about
how the development of


76
0:3:52,22 --> 0:3:56,31
quantum theory in the 20th
century is going to impact


77
0:3:56,31 --> 0:4:3,6
21st century technologies and
in particular information


78
0:4:3,6 --> 0:4:3,83
technology.


79
0:4:3,83 --> 0:4:7,39
Now, quantum theory is
over 100 years old.


80
0:4:7,39 --> 0:4:9,61
But there are some ways in which
classical and quantum


81
0:4:9,61 --> 0:4:14,46
systems differ that we are
really only appreciating


82
0:4:14,46 --> 0:4:16,86
deeply in the last
couple of years.


83
0:4:16,86 --> 0:4:19,82
And those properties have to do
with information encoded in


84
0:4:19,82 --> 0:4:21,649
physical systems.


85
0:4:21,649 --> 0:4:24,18
To a physicist, information is
something that we can encode


86
0:4:24,18 --> 0:4:28,28
and store in the state of some
physical system like


87
0:4:28,28 --> 0:4:29,79
the pages of a book.


88
0:4:29,79 --> 0:4:33,43
But fundamentally, all physical
systems are really


89
0:4:33,43 --> 0:4:35,97
quantum systems governed
by quantum physics.


90
0:4:35,97 --> 0:4:39,36
So information is something that
we can encode and store


91
0:4:39,36 --> 0:4:42,43
in a quantum system.


92
0:4:42,43 --> 0:4:45,73
And information carried by
quantum systems has some


93
0:4:45,73 --> 0:4:48,88
famously counter-intuitive
properties.


94
0:4:48,88 --> 0:4:52,28
So physicists like to
speak about the


95
0:4:52,28 --> 0:4:54,46
weirdness of quantum theory.


96
0:4:54,46 --> 0:4:59,95
And we relish that weirdness and
take great delight in it.


97
0:4:59,95 --> 0:5:2,71
But more recently, we're asking
more seriously whether


98
0:5:2,71 --> 0:5:6,69
it's possible to put that
weirdness to work to exploit


99
0:5:6,69 --> 0:5:10,71
unusual properties of quantum
information, to perform tasks


100
0:5:10,71 --> 0:5:14,52
that wouldn't be possible if
this were a less weird,


101
0:5:14,52 --> 0:5:16,7
classical world.


102
0:5:16,7 --> 0:5:19,98
And that desire to put weirdness
to work has driven


103
0:5:19,98 --> 0:5:21,65
the emergence of
a field we call


104
0:5:21,65 --> 0:5:23,7
quantum information science.


105
0:5:23,7 --> 0:5:27,52
Which from my perspective,
derives a lot of its


106
0:5:27,52 --> 0:5:31,77
intellectual vitality from
three main ideas, quantum


107
0:5:31,77 --> 0:5:34,11
entanglement, quantum computing,
and quantum error


108
0:5:34,11 --> 0:5:35,22
correction.


109
0:5:35,22 --> 0:5:38,51
And my goal in the talk is to
introduce you to these ideas,


110
0:5:38,51 --> 0:5:41,55
if you're not already
familiar with them.


111
0:5:41,55 --> 0:5:45,12
So starting at the beginning,
we know that we can express


112
0:5:45,12 --> 0:5:49,62
classical information in terms
of bits, where we might think


113
0:5:49,62 --> 0:5:53,6
of a bit as an object like a
ball that, can be either one


114
0:5:53,6 --> 0:5:55,8
or two colors say
red or green.


115
0:5:55,8 --> 0:5:59,7
And if I want to, I can
store a bit in a box.


116
0:5:59,7 --> 0:6:2,79
And then later on if I open the
box, the color ball I put


117
0:6:2,79 --> 0:6:3,9
in comes out again.


118
0:6:3,9 --> 0:6:6,81
So we can recover a
bit and read it.


119
0:6:6,81 --> 0:6:9,7
Quantum information, too, can
be expressed in terms of


120
0:6:9,7 --> 0:6:15,18
indivisible units, what we call
quantum bits or qubits.


121
0:6:15,18 --> 0:6:19,69
And for many purposes, it's
useful to think of a qubit as


122
0:6:19,69 --> 0:6:21,62
an object stored in a box.


123
0:6:21,62 --> 0:6:25,9
But where now, we can open the
box in two complementary ways,


124
0:6:25,9 --> 0:6:28,46
two different ways to
prepare or observe


125
0:6:28,46 --> 0:6:29,99
the state of a qubit.


126
0:6:29,99 --> 0:6:34,29
And if I put information in door
number one or door number


127
0:6:34,29 --> 0:6:39,13
two, then later on I can open
the same door again and the


128
0:6:39,13 --> 0:6:42,35
color that I put in will come
out of the box, just like it


129
0:6:42,35 --> 0:6:44,7
were a classical bit.


130
0:6:44,7 --> 0:6:47,98
But if I say store information
in door number one and then


131
0:6:47,98 --> 0:6:51,71
later on open a complementary
door, door number two, then


132
0:6:51,71 --> 0:6:53,79
it's unpredictable
what we'll find.


133
0:6:53,79 --> 0:6:56,71
It has probability one-half
of being red, probability


134
0:6:56,71 --> 0:6:59,1
one-half of being green.


135
0:6:59,1 --> 0:7:2,66
So if you're going to observe
quantum information, you have


136
0:7:2,66 --> 0:7:3,62
to do it the right way.


137
0:7:3,62 --> 0:7:6,2
If you do it in the wrong way,
you'll actually damage the


138
0:7:6,2 --> 0:7:7,45
information.


139
0:7:7,45 --> 0:7:9,8



140
0:7:9,8 --> 0:7:12,32
And one reason why that's
important is appreciated if we


141
0:7:12,32 --> 0:7:15,17
think about copying
quantum states.


142
0:7:15,17 --> 0:7:18,51
If I had a quantum copying
machine, that would mean that


143
0:7:18,51 --> 0:7:21,12
if I happened to have put
information in door number one


144
0:7:21,12 --> 0:7:24,4
of a qubit, I could
make a copy.


145
0:7:24,4 --> 0:7:26,6
And then I could open door
number one of the original and


146
0:7:26,6 --> 0:7:29,45
the duplicate and out of
both I would find the


147
0:7:29,45 --> 0:7:31,49
color that I put in.


148
0:7:31,49 --> 0:7:34,49
Or if I put information in door
number two of the qubit,


149
0:7:34,49 --> 0:7:37,13
I could make a copy and open
door number two on the


150
0:7:37,13 --> 0:7:39,16
original and the duplicate.


151
0:7:39,16 --> 0:7:40,44
And the color that I
had put in would


152
0:7:40,44 --> 0:7:42,93
come out of both boxes.


153
0:7:42,93 --> 0:7:45,92
But, in fact, there is
no such machine.


154
0:7:45,92 --> 0:7:49,72
A machine that copies unknown
quantum states is not allowed


155
0:7:49,72 --> 0:7:52,6
by the rules of quantum
mechanics.


156
0:7:52,6 --> 0:7:56,14
And the reason is that to copy
what's inside the box, the


157
0:7:56,14 --> 0:7:59,4
machine has to probe
what's inside.


158
0:7:59,4 --> 0:8:1,26
And if it opens the right door,
the door that I used,


159
0:8:1,26 --> 0:8:3,77
then it can copy the
information, no problem, just


160
0:8:3,77 --> 0:8:5,41
as though it were classical.


161
0:8:5,41 --> 0:8:7,64
But if it opens the wrong
door, it will damage the


162
0:8:7,64 --> 0:8:8,36
information.


163
0:8:8,36 --> 0:8:10,96
And at that point, it won't
be possible to make a high


164
0:8:10,96 --> 0:8:12,99
fidelity copy.


165
0:8:12,99 --> 0:8:16,2
So although we might be able
to clone a sheep, we can't


166
0:8:16,2 --> 0:8:16,86
clone a qubit.


167
0:8:16,86 --> 0:8:21,0
We can't copy unknown
quantum states.


168
0:8:21,0 --> 0:8:23,4
Now, there are lots of
possible physical


169
0:8:23,4 --> 0:8:24,3
realizations of qubits.


170
0:8:24,3 --> 0:8:26,33
I'm going to mention
a couple of others


171
0:8:26,33 --> 0:8:27,42
later on in the talk.


172
0:8:27,42 --> 0:8:30,42
But just so you'll have
something concrete to think


173
0:8:30,42 --> 0:8:33,74
about for the moment, you can
imagine a single photon or


174
0:8:33,74 --> 0:8:36,5
particle of light which
has an electric field.


175
0:8:36,5 --> 0:8:40,82
And that electric field can be
oriented either horizontally


176
0:8:40,82 --> 0:8:45,76
or vertically, corresponding to
observing our qubit through


177
0:8:45,76 --> 0:8:48,4
door number one and seeing
two possibilities.


178
0:8:48,4 --> 0:8:50,21
Or we can imagine observing
it in these


179
0:8:50,21 --> 0:8:52,305
45-degree rotated axes.


180
0:8:52,305 --> 0:8:54,93
And that corresponds to opening
door number two, the


181
0:8:54,93 --> 0:8:59,35
complementary door, to
observe the qubit.


182
0:8:59,35 --> 0:9:2,6
The really interesting
differences between classical


183
0:9:2,6 --> 0:9:5,33
and quantum information arise
only when we consider systems


184
0:9:5,33 --> 0:9:7,16
with more than one part.


185
0:9:7,16 --> 0:9:9,58
So suppose we have two qubits.


186
0:9:9,58 --> 0:9:11,66
They can be far apart
from one another.


187
0:9:11,66 --> 0:9:14,49
One is at Caltech,
in Pasadena.


188
0:9:14,49 --> 0:9:18,1
The other is in the custody of
my friend, far away in the


189
0:9:18,1 --> 0:9:20,24
Andromeda galaxy.


190
0:9:20,24 --> 0:9:23,0
But a long time ago when these
two qubits were both on Earth


191
0:9:23,0 --> 0:9:25,11
and could interact with one
another, they were prepared in


192
0:9:25,11 --> 0:9:28,38
a particular state with some
interesting properties.


193
0:9:28,38 --> 0:9:34,87
Namely, I can open my box in
Pasadena and open it through


194
0:9:34,87 --> 0:9:36,48
either door number one
or door number two.


195
0:9:36,48 --> 0:9:40,3
And either way, what comes out
of the box is random, has


196
0:9:40,3 --> 0:9:43,21
probability one-half of being
either red or green.


197
0:9:43,21 --> 0:9:45,7
And the same thing is true for
my friend in Andromeda.


198
0:9:45,7 --> 0:9:50,15
He can open either box and
either way sees a random bit.


199
0:9:50,15 --> 0:9:54,6
So neither one of us by opening
his box can acquire


200
0:9:54,6 --> 0:9:56,56
any information.


201
0:9:56,56 --> 0:9:58,37
It just generates
a random bit.


202
0:9:58,37 --> 0:10:1,46
And that's kind of surprising
because with two boxes, we


203
0:10:1,46 --> 0:10:6,445
ought to have been able to store
two bits of information.


204
0:10:6,445 --> 0:10:8,71
So where is that information
hidden?


205
0:10:8,71 --> 0:10:12,33
The answer for this particular
state of the two boxes is that


206
0:10:12,33 --> 0:10:14,52
all the information is actually
encoded in the


207
0:10:14,52 --> 0:10:17,94
correlations between
the two boxes.


208
0:10:17,94 --> 0:10:21,25
For this particular state, if my
friend and I both open door


209
0:10:21,25 --> 0:10:24,21
number one, we're guaranteed
to find the same color.


210
0:10:24,21 --> 0:10:25,5
It could be red,
could be green.


211
0:10:25,5 --> 0:10:28,14
But we always find the same one
if we open the same door.


212
0:10:28,14 --> 0:10:31,42
And likewise, if we both open
door number two, we always


213
0:10:31,42 --> 0:10:34,1
find the same color, probability
one-half of being


214
0:10:34,1 --> 0:10:36,1
red, probability one-half
of being green.


215
0:10:36,1 --> 0:10:39,83
But it's guaranteed to be the
same if we open the same door.


216
0:10:39,83 --> 0:10:44,24
And there are four
distinguishable ways in which


217
0:10:44,24 --> 0:10:46,23
a box in Pasadena could
be correlated


218
0:10:46,23 --> 0:10:47,84
with a box in Andromeda.


219
0:10:47,84 --> 0:10:52,49
We could either see the same bit
or opposite bits when we


220
0:10:52,49 --> 0:10:56,43
both open door number one or we
both open door number two.


221
0:10:56,43 --> 0:10:58,12
We've chosen one of
those four ways.


222
0:10:58,12 --> 0:11:0,86
So that's two bits
of information


223
0:11:0,86 --> 0:11:1,89
stored in the boxes.


224
0:11:1,89 --> 0:11:5,16
But what's unusual is the
information is locally


225
0:11:5,16 --> 0:11:6,0
inaccessible.


226
0:11:6,0 --> 0:11:8,9
We can't acquire any of that
information by looking at the


227
0:11:8,9 --> 0:11:11,53
boxes one at a time.


228
0:11:11,53 --> 0:11:14,7
And that property of quantum
information, that it can be


229
0:11:14,7 --> 0:11:18,11
stored nonlocally, shared
between two distantly


230
0:11:18,11 --> 0:11:21,77
separated systems, is what we
call quantum entanglement.


231
0:11:21,77 --> 0:11:25,95
And that's the really central,
essential way in with quantum


232
0:11:25,95 --> 0:11:30,73
information is different from
classical information.


233
0:11:30,73 --> 0:11:33,55
Correlations themselves are
not such an unusual thing.


234
0:11:33,55 --> 0:11:36,93
We encounter them all the
time in daily life.


235
0:11:36,93 --> 0:11:39,7
I normally wear two socks
that are the same color.


236
0:11:39,7 --> 0:11:42,98
It means that if you look at
my left foot, then you know


237
0:11:42,98 --> 0:11:46,6
for sure what color
to expect when you


238
0:11:46,6 --> 0:11:47,45
look at my right foot.


239
0:11:47,45 --> 0:11:48,685
Yeah, Hartman just tried it.


240
0:11:48,685 --> 0:11:50,27
It worked.


241
0:11:50,27 --> 0:11:54,36
And that's a correlation.


242
0:11:54,36 --> 0:11:58,89
And you might say it's kind
of similar with the boxes.


243
0:11:58,89 --> 0:12:4,91
If I want to see what my friend
is going to see when he


244
0:12:4,91 --> 0:12:8,38
opens store number one in
Andromeda, I can open door


245
0:12:8,38 --> 0:12:9,54
number one in Pasadena.


246
0:12:9,54 --> 0:12:12,5
If I want to know what my friend
is going to see when he


247
0:12:12,5 --> 0:12:15,52
opens door number two, I can
open door number two.


248
0:12:15,52 --> 0:12:18,45
So aren't the boxes are really
just like the socks?


249
0:12:18,45 --> 0:12:20,12
No, they're really different.


250
0:12:20,12 --> 0:12:21,73
There's a big difference
between this quantum


251
0:12:21,73 --> 0:12:24,89
correlation and classical
correlation.


252
0:12:24,89 --> 0:12:27,45
An essential difference is
there's just one way


253
0:12:27,45 --> 0:12:28,47
to look at a sock.


254
0:12:28,47 --> 0:12:31,67
But we have these two
complementary ways of looking


255
0:12:31,67 --> 0:12:33,81
at a qubit, of opening
a quantum box.


256
0:12:33,81 --> 0:12:38,63
And that means that the
correlations among qubits are


257
0:12:38,63 --> 0:12:41,49
richer and more interesting
than correlations among


258
0:12:41,49 --> 0:12:43,84
classical bits.


259
0:12:43,84 --> 0:12:46,94
This phenomenon of quantum
entanglement is an old thing.


260
0:12:46,94 --> 0:12:51,73
It was discussed quite
explicitly by Einstein in a


261
0:12:51,73 --> 0:12:55,4
famous 1935 paper, with
two collaborators.


262
0:12:55,4 --> 0:12:59,2
And to Einstein, quantum
entanglement was so unsettling


263
0:12:59,2 --> 0:13:2,66
as to indicate that something
is missing from our current


264
0:13:2,66 --> 0:13:7,3
understanding of the quantum
description of nature.


265
0:13:7,3 --> 0:13:11,92
And that paper induced some
interesting responses,


266
0:13:11,92 --> 0:13:14,64
including one from Schrodinger
later that year, which was


267
0:13:14,64 --> 0:13:17,18
especially insightful.


268
0:13:17,18 --> 0:13:19,89
And Schrodinger described
entanglement this way.


269
0:13:19,89 --> 0:13:23,15
He said the best possible
knowledge of a whole does not


270
0:13:23,15 --> 0:13:25,51
necessarily include
the best possible


271
0:13:25,51 --> 0:13:27,64
knowledge of its parts.


272
0:13:27,64 --> 0:13:31,34
What he meant was that even if
we know exactly how those two


273
0:13:31,34 --> 0:13:34,28
boxes were prepared, know
everything about those two


274
0:13:34,28 --> 0:13:37,71
boxes, we are still helpless to
predict what will be found


275
0:13:37,71 --> 0:13:41,73
when we open one of the boxes
in Pasadena or Andromeda.


276
0:13:41,73 --> 0:13:44,7
And it was Schrodinger who
suggested, using the word


277
0:13:44,7 --> 0:13:49,2
"entanglement" or "entangled"
to describe that situation.


278
0:13:49,2 --> 0:13:51,98
He also said it's discomforting
that the theory


279
0:13:51,98 --> 0:13:56,19
should allow a system to be
steered or piloted into one or


280
0:13:56,19 --> 0:13:59,47
the other type of state at the
experimenter's mercy, in spite


281
0:13:59,47 --> 0:14:2,0
of his having no access to it.


282
0:14:2,0 --> 0:14:5,0
Schrodinger meant isn't it odd
that it's up to me to decide


283
0:14:5,0 --> 0:14:8,58
by opening door number one or
door number two whether I will


284
0:14:8,58 --> 0:14:12,11
know what my friend will see
when he opens door number one


285
0:14:12,11 --> 0:14:13,88
or door number two?


286
0:14:13,88 --> 0:14:16,24
But Schrodinger also understood
that these


287
0:14:16,24 --> 0:14:20,84
correlations don't enable us
to send a message from


288
0:14:20,84 --> 0:14:23,81
Pasadena to Andromeda
instantaneously.


289
0:14:23,81 --> 0:14:27,32
No matter what I do, my friend
opens either door number one


290
0:14:27,32 --> 0:14:29,98
or door number two and just
finds a random bit, learning


291
0:14:29,98 --> 0:14:32,27
nothing about what I did
and receiving no


292
0:14:32,27 --> 0:14:34,54
information from me.


293
0:14:34,54 --> 0:14:39,38
Now, this phenomenon or idea
of quantum entanglement did


294
0:14:39,38 --> 0:14:43,33
not advance very much for
30 years after that.


295
0:14:43,33 --> 0:14:48,16
Until the mid-'60s, when John
Bell started us thinking about


296
0:14:48,16 --> 0:14:50,39
quantum entanglement in a
rather different way.


297
0:14:50,39 --> 0:14:54,29
Not just as something weird,
but something potentially


298
0:14:54,29 --> 0:14:58,51
useful, a resource that we
can use to do things.


299
0:14:58,51 --> 0:15:2,44
Specifically, Bell described
games that two players can


300
0:15:2,44 --> 0:15:4,92
play, Alice and Bob.


301
0:15:4,92 --> 0:15:6,7
It's a cooperative game.


302
0:15:6,7 --> 0:15:7,81
Alice and Bob are on
the same side.


303
0:15:7,81 --> 0:15:9,6
They're both trying to win.


304
0:15:9,6 --> 0:15:13,14
The way the game works is that
Alice and Bob receive inputs


305
0:15:13,14 --> 0:15:15,79
and they are to produce outputs
which are correlated


306
0:15:15,79 --> 0:15:19,95
in a certain way, depending on
the inputs that they receive.


307
0:15:19,95 --> 0:15:23,96
And if they receive some
correlated bits before the


308
0:15:23,96 --> 0:15:27,51
game began, they're allowed to
consult those correlated bits.


309
0:15:27,51 --> 0:15:30,7
But under the rules of the game,
Alice and Bob cannot


310
0:15:30,7 --> 0:15:33,67
communicate between the time
that they receive the inputs


311
0:15:33,67 --> 0:15:36,43
and the time that they
produce their output.


312
0:15:36,43 --> 0:15:40,75
And for this particular game, if
they play the best possible


313
0:15:40,75 --> 0:15:46,67
strategy, they can win with a
probability of success 3/4,


314
0:15:46,67 --> 0:15:49,17
averaged over the inputs that
they could receive, if we


315
0:15:49,17 --> 0:15:52,58
assume they're uniformly
distributed.


316
0:15:52,58 --> 0:15:54,52
But there's a quantum
version of the game.


317
0:15:54,52 --> 0:15:55,2
It's the same game.


318
0:15:55,2 --> 0:15:59,38
But now, Alice and Bob are
permitted to use entangled


319
0:15:59,38 --> 0:16:3,18
qubits that were distributed
before the game began.


320
0:16:3,18 --> 0:16:5,68
And by making use of that
entanglement, they can play a


321
0:16:5,68 --> 0:16:9,2
better quantum strategy and
win the game with a higher


322
0:16:9,2 --> 0:16:13,15
success probability,
above 85%.


323
0:16:13,15 --> 0:16:15,89
So the quantum correlations
are good for something.


324
0:16:15,89 --> 0:16:20,6
They allow you to win this game
with higher probability.


325
0:16:20,6 --> 0:16:22,71
And experimental physicists have
been playing the game for


326
0:16:22,71 --> 0:16:25,41
decades now and they keep
winning with this higher


327
0:16:25,41 --> 0:16:30,29
probability of success that Bell
showed us is possible in


328
0:16:30,29 --> 0:16:31,12
quantum physics.


329
0:16:31,12 --> 0:16:33,76
So these quantum correlations,
stronger than classical


330
0:16:33,76 --> 0:16:36,83
correlations, really do
seem to be part of


331
0:16:36,83 --> 0:16:39,99
the way nature behaves.


332
0:16:39,99 --> 0:16:44,46
Now, to Einstein quantum
entanglement was kind of


333
0:16:44,46 --> 0:16:45,1
disgusting.


334
0:16:45,1 --> 0:16:48,76
And he called it spooky
action at a distance


335
0:16:48,76 --> 0:16:49,79
in a derisive tone.


336
0:16:49,79 --> 0:16:54,27
This sounds even more derisive
when you say it in German.


337
0:16:54,27 --> 0:16:56,9
But it doesn't matter
in physics what


338
0:16:56,9 --> 0:16:58,7
Einstein things, right?


339
0:16:58,7 --> 0:17:2,65
Nature is the way experiments
reveal her to be.


340
0:17:2,65 --> 0:17:6,329
And we have to learn to
love her as she is.


341
0:17:6,329 --> 0:17:10,15
Quantum entanglement is really
part of the world.


342
0:17:10,15 --> 0:17:10,94
OK.


343
0:17:10,94 --> 0:17:14,92
So in a world with quantum
correlations, we can use those


344
0:17:14,92 --> 0:17:17,827
correlations to do things that
we wouldn't be able to do if


345
0:17:17,827 --> 0:17:19,24
all correlations
were classical.


346
0:17:19,24 --> 0:17:21,119
Boxes are not like socks.


347
0:17:21,119 --> 0:17:22,81
You can win a game with
a probability of


348
0:17:22,81 --> 0:17:26,329
85% instead of 75%.


349
0:17:26,329 --> 0:17:28,71
Is that really a big deal?


350
0:17:28,71 --> 0:17:29,1
Yeah.


351
0:17:29,1 --> 0:17:31,95
This is a really,
really big deal.


352
0:17:31,95 --> 0:17:34,67
And to appreciate why it's a
big deal, we really should


353
0:17:34,67 --> 0:17:38,69
think about systems
with many parts.


354
0:17:38,69 --> 0:17:42,93
Now suppose, for example,
that I have a book.


355
0:17:42,93 --> 0:17:44,92
It's 100 pages long.


356
0:17:44,92 --> 0:17:48,22
It consists of a hundred
subsystems, each a page.


357
0:17:48,22 --> 0:17:50,86
If it were a classical book
rather, with bits printed on


358
0:17:50,86 --> 0:17:56,9
every page, you could read a
single page and you'd know 1%


359
0:17:56,9 --> 0:17:58,43
of the content of the book.


360
0:17:58,43 --> 0:18:2,55
10 pages, you'd know 10% of
the content of the book.


361
0:18:2,55 --> 0:18:6,31
But suppose it's a highly
entangled quantum book.


362
0:18:6,31 --> 0:18:8,74
Then if you look at the pages
one at a time, what you see is


363
0:18:8,74 --> 0:18:11,87
really just random gibberish,
which tells you nothing about


364
0:18:11,87 --> 0:18:15,56
the content of the book, if it's
a highly entangled book.


365
0:18:15,56 --> 0:18:18,87
If you want to distinguish one
entangled quantum book from


366
0:18:18,87 --> 0:18:21,76
another, you can't tell the
difference by looking at the


367
0:18:21,76 --> 0:18:24,46
pages one at a time because the
information isn't printed


368
0:18:24,46 --> 0:18:26,12
on individual pages.


369
0:18:26,12 --> 0:18:29,27
Almost all the information is
encoded in the correlations


370
0:18:29,27 --> 0:18:30,96
among the pages.


371
0:18:30,96 --> 0:18:33,62
If you want to distinguish one
such book from another, you


372
0:18:33,62 --> 0:18:36,9
have to make a difficult
collective observation on many


373
0:18:36,9 --> 0:18:39,17
pages at once, perhaps
more than half the


374
0:18:39,17 --> 0:18:41,43
pages in the book.


375
0:18:41,43 --> 0:18:45,51
If I have a quantum system
consisting of qubits, and a


376
0:18:45,51 --> 0:18:49,58
rather modest number of qubits,
just a few hundred, if


377
0:18:49,58 --> 0:18:52,75
I wanted to give a complete
description of all the ways in


378
0:18:52,75 --> 0:18:55,54
which those qubits are
correlated with one another, I


379
0:18:55,54 --> 0:18:58,7
would have to write down a
huge amount of classical


380
0:18:58,7 --> 0:19:0,72
information, more bits than
the number of atoms in the


381
0:19:0,72 --> 0:19:2,4
visible universe.


382
0:19:2,4 --> 0:19:4,94
It will never be possible, even
in principle, to write a


383
0:19:4,94 --> 0:19:6,54
description like that down.


384
0:19:6,54 --> 0:19:10,23
There's too much classical
information to describe this


385
0:19:10,23 --> 0:19:14,61
extravagant correlation of just
a few hundred qubits.


386
0:19:14,61 --> 0:19:16,91
And that property of quantum
information, that we can't


387
0:19:16,91 --> 0:19:21,47
hope to describe it using
classical information, was


388
0:19:21,47 --> 0:19:23,7
intriguing in particular
to the Caltech


389
0:19:23,7 --> 0:19:25,9
physicist Richard Feynman.


390
0:19:25,9 --> 0:19:30,1
And it led Feynman to make the
suggestion in the early 1980s


391
0:19:30,1 --> 0:19:33,56
that if we could process
quantum bits instead of


392
0:19:33,56 --> 0:19:37,95
classical bits, operate a
scalable quantum computer,


393
0:19:37,95 --> 0:19:41,35
we'd be able to perform tasks
that would be beyond the


394
0:19:41,35 --> 0:19:44,79
capability of any conceivable
digital computer.


395
0:19:44,79 --> 0:19:48,42
So Feynman's idea was that if
we can't even write down in


396
0:19:48,42 --> 0:19:52,2
terms of classical bits the
state of a few hundred qubits,


397
0:19:52,2 --> 0:19:55,46
then perhaps by processing the
qubits, we'd be able to


398
0:19:55,46 --> 0:19:58,66
perform a task that we
can't emulate with


399
0:19:58,66 --> 0:20:1,41
ordinary digital computers.


400
0:20:1,41 --> 0:20:5,18
When Feynman was making this
suggestion in the early 1980s,


401
0:20:5,18 --> 0:20:8,87
there was an undergraduate at
Caltech, concentrating in


402
0:20:8,87 --> 0:20:11,39
mathematics, named Peter Shor.


403
0:20:11,39 --> 0:20:15,8
And Shor, like all Caltech
undergraduates, had to take


404
0:20:15,8 --> 0:20:16,16
our core curriculum.


405
0:20:16,16 --> 0:20:20,31
Everybody at Caltech has to
learn quantum mechanics, even


406
0:20:20,31 --> 0:20:21,24
if you major in music.


407
0:20:21,24 --> 0:20:23,14
We don't have a lot
of music majors.


408
0:20:23,14 --> 0:20:25,1
Everybody has to learn quantum
mechanics when you're a


409
0:20:25,1 --> 0:20:26,48
sophomore and Peter did.


410
0:20:26,48 --> 0:20:30,83
And as far as I know, that was
the most advanced class in


411
0:20:30,83 --> 0:20:31,87
physics that he took.


412
0:20:31,87 --> 0:20:35,7
But like many Caltech
undergraduates, he remembered


413
0:20:35,7 --> 0:20:38,77
what he learned as a sophomore
about quantum physics.


414
0:20:38,77 --> 0:20:44,58
And he drew upon that knowledge
about 13 years later


415
0:20:44,58 --> 0:20:48,34
to make an amazing discovery.


416
0:20:48,34 --> 0:20:51,37
Shor, in 1994, realized that if
you could build a quantum


417
0:20:51,37 --> 0:20:55,98
computer, it would be able to
solve certain problems like


418
0:20:55,98 --> 0:21:1,83
finding the prime factors of
large composite integers very,


419
0:21:1,83 --> 0:21:2,42
very quickly.


420
0:21:2,42 --> 0:21:6,0
That for a quantum computer,
factoring would not be much


421
0:21:6,0 --> 0:21:10,31
harder than multiplying
numbers together.


422
0:21:10,31 --> 0:21:12,54
And when I first heard about
this, as Hartman said in the


423
0:21:12,54 --> 0:21:16,7
introduction, this was in 1994,
I didn't know much about


424
0:21:16,7 --> 0:21:17,91
computer science or
cryptography.


425
0:21:17,91 --> 0:21:22,45
I was working on particle
physics, and cosmology, and


426
0:21:22,45 --> 0:21:24,51
gravitational physics.


427
0:21:24,51 --> 0:21:26,1
But as soon as I heard
about this, I was


428
0:21:26,1 --> 0:21:27,85
really amazed and stunned.


429
0:21:27,85 --> 0:21:30,55
Because I understood the
implications are quite


430
0:21:30,55 --> 0:21:31,42
remarkable.


431
0:21:31,42 --> 0:21:35,77
That the boundary between hard
problems and easy problems,


432
0:21:35,77 --> 0:21:38,66
the problems that we should be
able to solve some day with


433
0:21:38,66 --> 0:21:41,4
advanced technologies versus the
problems that we never any


434
0:21:41,4 --> 0:21:45,22
hope of solving, that boundary
is different than it otherwise


435
0:21:45,22 --> 0:21:48,41
would be because this is a
quantum world instead of a


436
0:21:48,41 --> 0:21:49,35
classical world.


437
0:21:49,35 --> 0:21:51,9
I thought it was one of the most
interesting things I had


438
0:21:51,9 --> 0:21:53,72
ever heard in my scientific
life.


439
0:21:53,72 --> 0:21:57,11
And it lead me eventually to
change the direction of my own


440
0:21:57,11 --> 0:21:58,34
research toward quantum


441
0:21:58,34 --> 0:22:0,16
information and quantum computing.


442
0:22:0,16 --> 0:22:2,75
Just to clarify what I'm talking
about, I'm talking


443
0:22:2,75 --> 0:22:5,61
about the scaling of the
resources that we need to


444
0:22:5,61 --> 0:22:7,4
solve the problem.


445
0:22:7,4 --> 0:22:9,92
A hard factoring problem
nowadays is


446
0:22:9,92 --> 0:22:12,23
factoring 193 digits.


447
0:22:12,23 --> 0:22:17,23
That's been done by a network of
a few hundred workstations


448
0:22:17,23 --> 0:22:20,41
collaborating over the internet
in a few months.


449
0:22:20,41 --> 0:22:22,92
But from what we know about
the scaling of the best


450
0:22:22,92 --> 0:22:26,55
classical algorithms for
factoring, if that same


451
0:22:26,55 --> 0:22:30,95
hardware were used to try to
factor a 500-digit number, it


452
0:22:30,95 --> 0:22:33,28
would take longer than the
age of the universe.


453
0:22:33,28 --> 0:22:36,0
So that's not something that we
expect to happen, factoring


454
0:22:36,0 --> 0:22:38,8
500-digit numbers in the
very near future


455
0:22:38,8 --> 0:22:41,26
with classical computers.


456
0:22:41,26 --> 0:22:43,55
Now, let's imagine that I have
a quantum computer with the


457
0:22:43,55 --> 0:22:46,1
same clock speed as that
classical computer.


458
0:22:46,1 --> 0:22:50,45
It can perform the same number
of basic operations per second


459
0:22:50,45 --> 0:22:54,59
as the classical computer, but
now on qubits instead of bits.


460
0:22:54,59 --> 0:22:56,94
And then we would be able
to factor, using Shor's


461
0:22:56,94 --> 0:23:0,7
algorithm, the 193-digit number
in about a tenth of a


462
0:23:0,7 --> 0:23:3,335
second and the 500-digit
number in two seconds.


463
0:23:3,335 --> 0:23:5,81
Now, there's a completely
different scaling of the


464
0:23:5,81 --> 0:23:8,46
resources we need with the
size of the input to the


465
0:23:8,46 --> 0:23:12,49
problem when we run
Shor's algorithm.


466
0:23:12,49 --> 0:23:13,76
But who cares about factoring?


467
0:23:13,76 --> 0:23:16,52
People do care about factoring
because the presumed


468
0:23:16,52 --> 0:23:22,1
difficulty of factoring is the
basis of widely used, public,


469
0:23:22,1 --> 0:23:24,47
key cryptography schemes.


470
0:23:24,47 --> 0:23:27,0
There are other problems that
quantum computers can break


471
0:23:27,0 --> 0:23:30,92
which are alternative ways
of doing public key.


472
0:23:30,92 --> 0:23:34,22
When quantum computers are
widely available, we won't be


473
0:23:34,22 --> 0:23:37,3
able to protect our privacy in
the same way that we're doing


474
0:23:37,3 --> 0:23:40,33
it now using current
public key schemes.


475
0:23:40,33 --> 0:23:41,95
Alternatives exist.


476
0:23:41,95 --> 0:23:45,4
But it's still not exactly clear
how we will best protect


477
0:23:45,4 --> 0:23:48,4
our privacy in the post-quantum
world.


478
0:23:48,4 --> 0:23:52,92
That's a ongoing subject
of discussion.


479
0:23:52,92 --> 0:23:55,33
But the more important thing,
more broadly, that we learn


480
0:23:55,33 --> 0:23:59,7
from Peter Shor's algorithm is
that there's an interesting


481
0:23:59,7 --> 0:24:0,79
classification of problems.


482
0:24:0,79 --> 0:24:4,14
There are problems which
are classically hard


483
0:24:4,14 --> 0:24:5,27
and quantumly easy.


484
0:24:5,27 --> 0:24:8,38
Problems that we can't solve
with reasonable scaling of


485
0:24:8,38 --> 0:24:11,62
resources with classical
computers, but which we can


486
0:24:11,62 --> 0:24:12,7
with quantum computers.


487
0:24:12,7 --> 0:24:16,67
And so it becomes an urgent
question, what lies in that


488
0:24:16,67 --> 0:24:19,1
intermediate region that's
quantumly easy


489
0:24:19,1 --> 0:24:22,66
and classically hard?


490
0:24:22,66 --> 0:24:24,77
And we still have a lot to
learn about that I think.


491
0:24:24,77 --> 0:24:27,16
We do know that quantum
computers have limitations.


492
0:24:27,16 --> 0:24:29,52
They can't speed
up everything.


493
0:24:29,52 --> 0:24:34,2
It seems that spectacular
speedups are possible only for


494
0:24:34,2 --> 0:24:36,3
problems with a special
structure.


495
0:24:36,3 --> 0:24:38,81
And in particular, we don't
think that quantum computers


496
0:24:38,81 --> 0:24:42,23
can dramatically speed
up problems which are


497
0:24:42,23 --> 0:24:45,22
NP-complete, the hardest
problems for which we can


498
0:24:45,22 --> 0:24:46,87
efficiently verify the solution


499
0:24:46,87 --> 0:24:48,93
with a classical computer.


500
0:24:48,93 --> 0:24:51,69
In the worst case, we can't do
much better than brute force


501
0:24:51,69 --> 0:24:53,75
search for the answer
in that case.


502
0:24:53,75 --> 0:24:57,7
Quantum computers can speed up
brute force searching, but not


503
0:24:57,7 --> 0:24:59,79
exponentially, only
quadratically, a more


504
0:24:59,79 --> 0:25:2,12
modest speed up.


505
0:25:2,12 --> 0:25:4,23
It's important to keep in mind
though that quantum computers


506
0:25:4,23 --> 0:25:7,64
can also solve problems that are
not in NP, problems where


507
0:25:7,64 --> 0:25:10,32
we can't check the answer with
a classical computer.


508
0:25:10,32 --> 0:25:14,25
And indeed, the most natural
application for quantum


509
0:25:14,25 --> 0:25:17,56
computers is to simulate the
time evolution of quantum


510
0:25:17,56 --> 0:25:21,12
systems with many particles,
many parts, which might be of


511
0:25:21,12 --> 0:25:25,3
interest in chemistry or in
the quantum field theories


512
0:25:25,3 --> 0:25:28,21
that physicists use to describe
elementary particles.


513
0:25:28,21 --> 0:25:32,2
So, for example, we can ask
about the type of problem that


514
0:25:32,2 --> 0:25:35,4
I as a particle physicist
used to worry about.


515
0:25:35,4 --> 0:25:38,32
Suppose we want to consider a
high energy collision between


516
0:25:38,32 --> 0:25:41,83
particles and we'd like to be
able to sample accurately from


517
0:25:41,83 --> 0:25:45,59
the possible states of many
particles that could be


518
0:25:45,59 --> 0:25:48,7
produced in that high
energy collision.


519
0:25:48,7 --> 0:25:52,35
And at least in some cases,
we've shown that that


520
0:25:52,35 --> 0:25:55,77
simulation can be done with
efficient scaling of resources


521
0:25:55,77 --> 0:25:58,89
on a quantum computer, which we
don't believe is the case


522
0:25:58,89 --> 0:26:0,12
classically.


523
0:26:0,12 --> 0:26:3,16
So it may be that a quantum
computer is capable of


524
0:26:3,16 --> 0:26:6,93
simulating efficiently any
quantum process that can occur


525
0:26:6,93 --> 0:26:9,56
in nature, though that's still
an open question, in


526
0:26:9,56 --> 0:26:13,37
particular with regard to
processes in which both


527
0:26:13,37 --> 0:26:17,85
quantum mechanics and gravity
are important.


528
0:26:17,85 --> 0:26:21,11
So quantum computers would have
wonderful capabilities.


529
0:26:21,11 --> 0:26:22,84
We'd love to have them.


530
0:26:22,84 --> 0:26:24,46
Lots of people around
the world are


531
0:26:24,46 --> 0:26:26,28
working on quantum computing.


532
0:26:26,28 --> 0:26:28,22
So why don't we have
them already?


533
0:26:28,22 --> 0:26:30,7
What's the big delay?


534
0:26:30,7 --> 0:26:34,44
Well, it's really, really,
really hard.


535
0:26:34,44 --> 0:26:38,23
And part of what makes it hard
is that quantum systems are


536
0:26:38,23 --> 0:26:43,13
more susceptible to error, to
the damaging effects of noise,


537
0:26:43,13 --> 0:26:45,68
than classical systems.


538
0:26:45,68 --> 0:26:49,58
Physicists sometimes like to
speak about a quantum state of


539
0:26:49,58 --> 0:26:53,34
a cat, which is a superposition
of the live and


540
0:26:53,34 --> 0:26:56,23
dead state of a cat, or in
this case, the more human


541
0:26:56,23 --> 0:27:0,6
case, of a awake and
sleeping cat.


542
0:27:0,6 --> 0:27:5,38
Now, we never observe in our
everyday lives that kind of


543
0:27:5,38 --> 0:27:7,7
superposition of
macroscopically


544
0:27:7,7 --> 0:27:9,73
distinguishable states.


545
0:27:9,73 --> 0:27:11,99
And we understand why
that's the case.


546
0:27:11,99 --> 0:27:15,75
Because no real cat can be
perfectly isolated from its


547
0:27:15,75 --> 0:27:17,35
surroundings.


548
0:27:17,35 --> 0:27:21,91
And the interactions with the
environment very quickly in


549
0:27:21,91 --> 0:27:24,47
effect measure the cat,
projecting it onto a state


550
0:27:24,47 --> 0:27:26,98
which is either completely
alive or completely dead.


551
0:27:26,98 --> 0:27:30,59
That's a process that
we call decoherence.


552
0:27:30,59 --> 0:27:33,28
And decoherence is actually very
important for helping us


553
0:27:33,28 --> 0:27:36,52
understand why classical
physics works so well.


554
0:27:36,52 --> 0:27:39,64
Why, when we consider
macroscopic systems, we don't


555
0:27:39,64 --> 0:27:43,34
usually have to worry about
quantum phenomena.


556
0:27:43,34 --> 0:27:44,99
It's because decoherence
is extremely


557
0:27:44,99 --> 0:27:48,122
fast for big systems.


558
0:27:48,122 --> 0:27:52,47
Now, a quantum computer, when
we manage to build one, may


559
0:27:52,47 --> 0:27:54,11
not be much like a cat.


560
0:27:54,11 --> 0:27:58,45
But it will, like a cat,
inevitably interact at some


561
0:27:58,45 --> 0:28:0,46
level with its environment.


562
0:28:0,46 --> 0:28:1,68
There will be decoherence.


563
0:28:1,68 --> 0:28:5,27
And so the quantum computer will
crash unless we can find


564
0:28:5,27 --> 0:28:10,17
some way of fighting off
decoherence, of preventing


565
0:28:10,17 --> 0:28:14,67
sources of error from making
the quantum computer fail.


566
0:28:14,67 --> 0:28:17,3



567
0:28:17,3 --> 0:28:19,3
Errors are a problem, even
in the classical


568
0:28:19,3 --> 0:28:21,2
world, as we all know.


569
0:28:21,2 --> 0:28:24,94
I have many bits that
I cherish and I


570
0:28:24,94 --> 0:28:25,91
would hate to lose.


571
0:28:25,91 --> 0:28:29,0
And everywhere, there are
dragons lurking, who take


572
0:28:29,0 --> 0:28:32,7
delight in tampering with those
bits and flipping them


573
0:28:32,7 --> 0:28:34,53
from red to green,
or whatever.


574
0:28:34,53 --> 0:28:37,71
But we know ways of protecting
ourselves from the dragons.


575
0:28:37,71 --> 0:28:40,8
We can encode information
redundantly.


576
0:28:40,8 --> 0:28:44,47
So that if I have a bit that I
want to be sure to keep, I


577
0:28:44,47 --> 0:28:48,35
can, for example, store backup
copies of the bit.


578
0:28:48,35 --> 0:28:52,22
That's an example of a simple
code, which can be used to


579
0:28:52,22 --> 0:28:53,93
protect against errors.


580
0:28:53,93 --> 0:28:56,63
The dragon might come along
and flip the color


581
0:28:56,63 --> 0:28:58,31
of one of the balls.


582
0:28:58,31 --> 0:29:0,94
But as long as the dragon
hasn't had a chance to


583
0:29:0,94 --> 0:29:3,86
interact with more than one
ball, I can employ a busy


584
0:29:3,86 --> 0:29:7,33
beaver of the sort we have
many of at Caltech.


585
0:29:7,33 --> 0:29:10,84
And we can ask the beaver, if
he sees the one ball is a


586
0:29:10,84 --> 0:29:13,84
different color than the others,
to recolor that ball


587
0:29:13,84 --> 0:29:15,61
so that all three match.


588
0:29:15,61 --> 0:29:19,0
And so as long as only one of
the balls has been damaged, we


589
0:29:19,0 --> 0:29:22,5
can recover the original encoded
state and protect


590
0:29:22,5 --> 0:29:23,43
against errors.


591
0:29:23,43 --> 0:29:26,65
So we'd like to use the same
concept of protecting


592
0:29:26,65 --> 0:29:30,3
information from error through
redundant storage in the


593
0:29:30,3 --> 0:29:31,4
quantum world.


594
0:29:31,4 --> 0:29:34,51
But there are some potential
obstacles.


595
0:29:34,51 --> 0:29:38,11
As we've already discussed,
we can't copy


596
0:29:38,11 --> 0:29:39,34
unknown quantum states.


597
0:29:39,34 --> 0:29:42,89
So I can't take the state of a
quantum computer and store a


598
0:29:42,89 --> 0:29:47,16
backup copy in case the
original gets damaged.


599
0:29:47,16 --> 0:29:49,19
And there are more things that
can go wrong with quantum


600
0:29:49,19 --> 0:29:53,13
information than with classical
information.


601
0:29:53,13 --> 0:29:55,68
It could be that the dragon will
come along and open door


602
0:29:55,68 --> 0:29:58,8
number one of a qubit and flip
the color of the ball and


603
0:29:58,8 --> 0:29:59,72
reclose the box.


604
0:29:59,72 --> 0:30:1,99
That would be like a bit
flip that occurs


605
0:30:1,99 --> 0:30:4,25
in a classical bit.


606
0:30:4,25 --> 0:30:6,57
But it's also possible that
the dragon could open door


607
0:30:6,57 --> 0:30:9,49
number two and change the
color of the ball.


608
0:30:9,49 --> 0:30:13,4
That's what we call a phase
error in quantum information.


609
0:30:13,4 --> 0:30:17,23
It really has no analog in
the classical world.


610
0:30:17,23 --> 0:30:18,16
And there's another
way of thinking


611
0:30:18,16 --> 0:30:20,11
about these phase errors.


612
0:30:20,11 --> 0:30:23,13
Another way a phase error, an
error through door number two


613
0:30:23,13 --> 0:30:27,92
could occur, would be for a
dragon to open door number


614
0:30:27,92 --> 0:30:31,44
one, look at the color of the
ball, and not flip the color,


615
0:30:31,44 --> 0:30:33,86
but just remember the color,
make a record of


616
0:30:33,86 --> 0:30:35,58
what the color is.


617
0:30:35,58 --> 0:30:38,44
And that record will damage the
information if we try to


618
0:30:38,44 --> 0:30:41,22
look at the qubit through
the door number two.


619
0:30:41,22 --> 0:30:43,53
And in many physical situations,
it's easier to


620
0:30:43,53 --> 0:30:48,84
remember or record the value of
a bit than to flip a bit.


621
0:30:48,84 --> 0:30:51,6
And that means these phase
errors are particularly


622
0:30:51,6 --> 0:30:55,22
pervasive and hard
to avoid in many


623
0:30:55,22 --> 0:30:56,725
types of physical systems.


624
0:30:56,725 --> 0:31:0,82



625
0:31:0,82 --> 0:31:4,4
In fact, if we want to resist
decoherence, it means we have


626
0:31:4,4 --> 0:31:6,84
to somehow prevent the
environment from learning


627
0:31:6,84 --> 0:31:9,53
about the state of the quantum
computer during the course of


628
0:31:9,53 --> 0:31:10,87
the computation.


629
0:31:10,87 --> 0:31:14,17
If some record is left behind of
what the intermediate state


630
0:31:14,17 --> 0:31:17,48
of the quantum computer was,
that will cause the quantum


631
0:31:17,48 --> 0:31:19,53
computer to fail.


632
0:31:19,53 --> 0:31:23,87
If a quantum computation was
successful, then it should be


633
0:31:23,87 --> 0:31:26,94
that if you ask the quantum
computer after its done, what


634
0:31:26,94 --> 0:31:30,5
did you just do while you were
factoring that huge number, it


635
0:31:30,5 --> 0:31:34,8
should always answer I forget
because no record was left


636
0:31:34,8 --> 0:31:37,41
behind of the state
of the computer at


637
0:31:37,41 --> 0:31:39,5
intermediate times.


638
0:31:39,5 --> 0:31:42,12
So we really need to do a kind
of secret computation,


639
0:31:42,12 --> 0:31:45,33
completely sealed off from the
surroundings if we want a


640
0:31:45,33 --> 0:31:47,27
quantum computer to succeed.


641
0:31:47,27 --> 0:31:49,24
When we're done with the
computation and we have the


642
0:31:49,24 --> 0:31:52,22
result, it's OK to broadcast
that to the world and tell


643
0:31:52,22 --> 0:31:54,24
everyone what the answer is.


644
0:31:54,24 --> 0:31:57,4
But we can't have any record
left behind of the state of


645
0:31:57,4 --> 0:32:0,93
the quantum computer during the
course of the computation


646
0:32:0,93 --> 0:32:3,19
because that will cause the
computation to fail.


647
0:32:3,19 --> 0:32:6,64
So we have to figure out a way
to encrypt the processing that


648
0:32:6,64 --> 0:32:8,3
we're doing.


649
0:32:8,3 --> 0:32:10,2
And really our enemy here
is entanglement.


650
0:32:10,2 --> 0:32:13,23
It is entanglement between our
quantum computer and its


651
0:32:13,23 --> 0:32:16,22
environment, which drives
decoherence.


652
0:32:16,22 --> 0:32:19,51
And the way to fight off that
entanglement is to use


653
0:32:19,51 --> 0:32:23,74
entanglement to our advantage,
to store information in a


654
0:32:23,74 --> 0:32:25,425
highly entangled state.


655
0:32:25,425 --> 0:32:29,46
If I want to store one logical
qubit, it is possible to do


656
0:32:29,46 --> 0:32:34,15
that if I have five physical
qubits, in such a way that if


657
0:32:34,15 --> 0:32:37,87
the dragon comes along and looks
at one of those five


658
0:32:37,87 --> 0:32:42,63
qubits, the dragon can't acquire
any information about


659
0:32:42,63 --> 0:32:45,26
what the logical state
is of the qubit by


660
0:32:45,26 --> 0:32:47,16
looking at that one box.


661
0:32:47,16 --> 0:32:50,47
This is just like the 100-page
book I described earlier.


662
0:32:50,47 --> 0:32:53,46
The state of the five qubits
is highly entangled.


663
0:32:53,46 --> 0:32:56,12
So if you want to know what the
information is stored in


664
0:32:56,12 --> 0:32:59,44
that five-qubit book, you can't
learn that information


665
0:32:59,44 --> 0:33:1,41
by looking at a single qubit.


666
0:33:1,41 --> 0:33:2,1
It's not there.


667
0:33:2,1 --> 0:33:5,13
It's in the correlations
among the qubits.


668
0:33:5,13 --> 0:33:8,79
And we can again ask the
beaver to help us out.


669
0:33:8,79 --> 0:33:11,2
After the dragon has done
something, and we don't know


670
0:33:11,2 --> 0:33:14,78
what, we can ask the beaver to
make some kind of collective


671
0:33:14,78 --> 0:33:17,54
observation on the five qubits,
which we can do with


672
0:33:17,54 --> 0:33:18,78
the quantum computer.


673
0:33:18,78 --> 0:33:21,77
And from that information learn,
not the state of the


674
0:33:21,77 --> 0:33:23,57
logical qubit that we're
trying to protect.


675
0:33:23,57 --> 0:33:27,4
We don't want anyone, even the
beaver, to know what that is.


676
0:33:27,4 --> 0:33:29,56
But what damage has occurred,
which of the boxes has been


677
0:33:29,56 --> 0:33:32,76
damaged, what needs to be done
to repair the damage.


678
0:33:32,76 --> 0:33:36,43
And then the beaver can
reinstate the original encoded


679
0:33:36,43 --> 0:33:39,43
state, if only one of the
qubits has been damaged.


680
0:33:39,43 --> 0:33:44,7
So that's the principle of
quantum error correction.


681
0:33:44,7 --> 0:33:46,76
And how do we actually
get this to work?


682
0:33:46,76 --> 0:33:49,78
Well, we'll see.


683
0:33:49,78 --> 0:33:57,22
But one hero of the story is my
colleague, Alexei Kitaev.


684
0:33:57,22 --> 0:34:2,15
I first met Alexei in 1997, on
his first visit to the US.


685
0:34:2,15 --> 0:34:6,5
He came to Caltech and gave a
talk on the first day we met.


686
0:34:6,5 --> 0:34:8,96
And I made these notes.


687
0:34:8,96 --> 0:34:12,56
And it was really one of the
most exciting days of my


688
0:34:12,56 --> 0:34:15,94
scientific life to talk to
Kitaev that way because I


689
0:34:15,94 --> 0:34:20,0
learned from him an idea which
I felt could potentially be


690
0:34:20,0 --> 0:34:23,21
transformative about quantum
error correction.


691
0:34:23,21 --> 0:34:26,29
And what I learned from Kitaev
is the connection between


692
0:34:26,29 --> 0:34:29,969
error correction and topology.


693
0:34:29,969 --> 0:34:32,54
"Topology" is the word
mathematicians use if they


694
0:34:32,54 --> 0:34:36,67
want to describe properties of
objects that remain invariant


695
0:34:36,67 --> 0:34:41,55
when we smoothly deform the
object without tearing it.


696
0:34:41,55 --> 0:34:44,5
And likewise, we would like
the way a quantum computer


697
0:34:44,5 --> 0:34:48,4
processes protected information
to remain


698
0:34:48,4 --> 0:34:52,4
invariant when we deform
the computer by


699
0:34:52,4 --> 0:34:54,8
introducing some noise.


700
0:34:54,8 --> 0:34:57,42
So we'd like to make use of
physical interactions that


701
0:34:57,42 --> 0:34:59,89
have topological features.


702
0:34:59,89 --> 0:35:1,54
Physicists have known
about such


703
0:35:1,54 --> 0:35:3,39
interactions for a long time.


704
0:35:3,39 --> 0:35:8,12
For example, I can consider an
electron interacting with a


705
0:35:8,12 --> 0:35:9,88
magnetic flux tube.


706
0:35:9,88 --> 0:35:12,63
And if that electron is carried
around the flux tube,


707
0:35:12,63 --> 0:35:15,31
even though it never penetrates
inside to interact


708
0:35:15,31 --> 0:35:19,13
directly with the magnetic
field, the quantum state of


709
0:35:19,13 --> 0:35:22,9
the electron will be modified.


710
0:35:22,9 --> 0:35:25,33
And that modification is really
a topological property.


711
0:35:25,33 --> 0:35:27,92
It stays the same
if we deform the


712
0:35:27,92 --> 0:35:29,19
trajectory of the electron.


713
0:35:29,19 --> 0:35:31,74
The only thing that matters is
the winding number of the


714
0:35:31,74 --> 0:35:35,62
electron around the flux tube.


715
0:35:35,62 --> 0:35:39,47
There are more exotic types of
topological interactions that


716
0:35:39,47 --> 0:35:43,8
can occur in two-dimensional
media, where there are


717
0:35:43,8 --> 0:35:46,44
point-like particles which
we call anyons.


718
0:35:46,44 --> 0:35:49,31
Non-abelian anyons in particular
have the property


719
0:35:49,31 --> 0:35:52,73
that I can consider a system of
many of these particles in


720
0:35:52,73 --> 0:35:54,84
a two-dimensional media.


721
0:35:54,84 --> 0:35:58,6
And there are lots of quantum
states we can construct of


722
0:35:58,6 --> 0:36:2,38
these many anyons, a number
of states which are all


723
0:36:2,38 --> 0:36:4,49
distinguishable, which
is exponential in


724
0:36:4,49 --> 0:36:6,59
the number of particles.


725
0:36:6,59 --> 0:36:9,87
But all of these quantum states
locally look the same.


726
0:36:9,87 --> 0:36:12,56
We can't see any of the
information that distinguishes


727
0:36:12,56 --> 0:36:14,66
one state from another
by looking at the


728
0:36:14,66 --> 0:36:16,61
particles one at a time.


729
0:36:16,61 --> 0:36:17,522
OK.


730
0:36:17,522 --> 0:36:19,34
The environment might
interact with the


731
0:36:19,34 --> 0:36:20,65
particles one at a time.


732
0:36:20,65 --> 0:36:23,61
But that doesn't allow any
information about the encoded


733
0:36:23,61 --> 0:36:26,82
state to leak to the
environment.


734
0:36:26,82 --> 0:36:29,61
And we can process the
information just by performing


735
0:36:29,61 --> 0:36:33,82
exchanges of the particles,
having particles swap places


736
0:36:33,82 --> 0:36:37,67
to get a different quantum
state, which can be a logical


737
0:36:37,67 --> 0:36:40,44
operation in a quantum
computer.


738
0:36:40,44 --> 0:36:45,16
So we can imagine operating a
topological quantum computer,


739
0:36:45,16 --> 0:36:48,96
that's what I learned from
Kitaev in 1997, which we could


740
0:36:48,96 --> 0:36:53,27
initialize by preparing pairs
of these particles in the


741
0:36:53,27 --> 0:36:56,7
two-dimensional medium,
anyons.


742
0:36:56,7 --> 0:36:59,99
And then process information
by performing a sequence of


743
0:36:59,99 --> 0:37:4,9
exchanges or swaps of the
particles, so that their world


744
0:37:4,9 --> 0:37:8,54
lines in 2 plus 1 dimensional
space-time trace out a braid


745
0:37:8,54 --> 0:37:11,25
in that three-dimensional
space.


746
0:37:11,25 --> 0:37:16,54
And then we can read out the
information at the end by, for


747
0:37:16,54 --> 0:37:19,14
example, bringing the particles
together pairwise


748
0:37:19,14 --> 0:37:21,58
and observing whether they
disappear, whether they


749
0:37:21,58 --> 0:37:24,96
annihilate or not.


750
0:37:24,96 --> 0:37:27,69
And what makes this idea
beautiful is that the


751
0:37:27,69 --> 0:37:31,27
computation is intrinsically
resistant to decoherence.


752
0:37:31,27 --> 0:37:34,27
If we keep the temperature low
so there are a lot of stray


753
0:37:34,27 --> 0:37:38,3
anyons wandering around, if we
keep the anyons far apart from


754
0:37:38,3 --> 0:37:40,75
one another, except at the very
beginning when we create


755
0:37:40,75 --> 0:37:44,46
the pairs and the very end when
we annihilate the pairs,


756
0:37:44,46 --> 0:37:47,62
then there's no way for the
information that's being


757
0:37:47,62 --> 0:37:50,32
processed to leak to
the environment.


758
0:37:50,32 --> 0:37:53,62
And if we perform the
right braid, we'll


759
0:37:53,62 --> 0:37:55,27
get the right answer.


760
0:37:55,27 --> 0:38:0,1
So it's topologically protected
quantum computation.


761
0:38:0,1 --> 0:38:3,28
So that looks pretty
good to a theorist.


762
0:38:3,28 --> 0:38:5,89
But how are we actually going
to build the system that has


763
0:38:5,89 --> 0:38:9,65
such non-abelian anyons that
could be the basis of the


764
0:38:9,65 --> 0:38:11,76
hardware for a quantum
computer?


765
0:38:11,76 --> 0:38:15,49
Well, here we can make use of
another idea which Kitaev and


766
0:38:15,49 --> 0:38:21,76
others have developed, a trick
for cutting electrons in half.


767
0:38:21,76 --> 0:38:23,43
You can think about
it this way.


768
0:38:23,43 --> 0:38:26,43
We can imagine a wire which
is superconducting.


769
0:38:26,43 --> 0:38:29,31
"Superconducting" means the
wire conducts electricity


770
0:38:29,31 --> 0:38:32,18
without any resistance.


771
0:38:32,18 --> 0:38:34,2
And there are really two types
of superconducting conducting


772
0:38:34,2 --> 0:38:36,87
wires, what we call conventional
or ordinary


773
0:38:36,87 --> 0:38:39,82
superconductors and something
called a topological


774
0:38:39,82 --> 0:38:41,0
superconductor.


775
0:38:41,0 --> 0:38:42,93
And at the boundary between
these two types of


776
0:38:42,93 --> 0:38:45,3
superconductivity sits
an object we


777
0:38:45,3 --> 0:38:47,96
call a Mayorana fermion.


778
0:38:47,96 --> 0:38:51,3
What's unusual about a
topological superconductor is


779
0:38:51,3 --> 0:38:55,11
that we can add one extra
electron to this topological


780
0:38:55,11 --> 0:38:57,23
superconductor and that
electron dissolves and


781
0:38:57,23 --> 0:38:59,55
disappears.


782
0:38:59,55 --> 0:39:2,66
In so doing, it actually changes
the state of this pair


783
0:39:2,66 --> 0:39:4,74
of Mayorana fermions
at the edge.


784
0:39:4,74 --> 0:39:8,95
Now, each Mayorana fermion
individually doesn't change in


785
0:39:8,95 --> 0:39:10,17
any perceptible way.


786
0:39:10,17 --> 0:39:12,84
But the pair of Mayorana
fermions does.


787
0:39:12,84 --> 0:39:17,47
And that can be used to store
a qubit of information.


788
0:39:17,47 --> 0:39:19,63
Experiments have been done
to look for this effect.


789
0:39:19,63 --> 0:39:21,72
They are not yet conclusive.


790
0:39:21,72 --> 0:39:25,36
They'll have to be repeated
and made more convincing.


791
0:39:25,36 --> 0:39:27,58
But there are at least
preliminary indications that


792
0:39:27,58 --> 0:39:31,0
this type of a topological
superconductivity in Mayorana


793
0:39:31,0 --> 0:39:34,71
fermions can be realized in
systems that experimental


794
0:39:34,71 --> 0:39:38,76
physicists know how to build now
using semiconductors and


795
0:39:38,76 --> 0:39:40,57
superconductors.


796
0:39:40,57 --> 0:39:42,57
Of course, we'd like to
be able to process the


797
0:39:42,57 --> 0:39:44,96
information by doing some
kind of braiding of


798
0:39:44,96 --> 0:39:46,76
these Mayorana fermions.


799
0:39:46,76 --> 0:39:48,56
And that is in principle
possible.


800
0:39:48,56 --> 0:39:53,16
If we have a network of wires,
we can manipulate the position


801
0:39:53,16 --> 0:39:56,78
of a Mayorana fermion by
adjusting some voltage gates,


802
0:39:56,78 --> 0:39:59,3
which determines where the
boundary is between


803
0:39:59,3 --> 0:40:2,28
conventional and a topological
superconductor.


804
0:40:2,28 --> 0:40:5,57
So I can take one of the
Mayorana fermions and park it


805
0:40:5,57 --> 0:40:9,2
around the corner of a
t-junction, move the first one


806
0:40:9,2 --> 0:40:12,7
over to the left, and then
unpark the other one.


807
0:40:12,7 --> 0:40:14,98
And so if we've achieved an
exchange of two Mayorana


808
0:40:14,98 --> 0:40:18,8
fermions, that would be like an
elementary logic gate in a


809
0:40:18,8 --> 0:40:19,69
quantum computer.


810
0:40:19,69 --> 0:40:22,71
So this type of experiment
hasn't been done yet.


811
0:40:22,71 --> 0:40:24,33
We're hopeful that it
can be done in the


812
0:40:24,33 --> 0:40:26,1
next couple of years.


813
0:40:26,1 --> 0:40:29,45
And that would be a potential
step towards building one type


814
0:40:29,45 --> 0:40:30,47
of quantum hardware.


815
0:40:30,47 --> 0:40:33,84
But apart from any technological
implications, it


816
0:40:33,84 --> 0:40:38,69
would be a real milestone for
physics to realize this type


817
0:40:38,69 --> 0:40:42,21
of exotic topological
interaction between particles


818
0:40:42,21 --> 0:40:46,73
in some system that physicists
can control.


819
0:40:46,73 --> 0:40:48,64
So I've talked about hardware.


820
0:40:48,64 --> 0:40:50,75
I would like to mention that
there are a variety of


821
0:40:50,75 --> 0:40:54,3
different ways of developing
hardware that are under


822
0:40:54,3 --> 0:40:57,27
development, many of which
look very interesting.


823
0:40:57,27 --> 0:41:1,79
And in particular, it's timely
to talk about ion-trap


824
0:41:1,79 --> 0:41:6,3
technology because Dave
Wineland's work in that area


825
0:41:6,3 --> 0:41:9,48
was recognized by the most
recent Nobel Prize in


826
0:41:9,48 --> 0:41:11,7
physics last year.


827
0:41:11,7 --> 0:41:16,15
Wineland and others have, over a
couple of decades, developed


828
0:41:16,15 --> 0:41:17,61
ion-trap technology.


829
0:41:17,61 --> 0:41:21,28
They have the ability to store
individual atoms, which have


830
0:41:21,28 --> 0:41:22,61
an electron stripped off.


831
0:41:22,61 --> 0:41:23,785
So they're electrically
charged.


832
0:41:23,785 --> 0:41:25,17
They're ions.


833
0:41:25,17 --> 0:41:26,75
They can be stored with
electromagnetic


834
0:41:26,75 --> 0:41:29,56
fields for a long time.


835
0:41:29,56 --> 0:41:34,34
And although each one is just
an individual atom, we can


836
0:41:34,34 --> 0:41:39,18
encode a qubit by imagining that
each atom is either in


837
0:41:39,18 --> 0:41:42,14
its lowest energy state, its
ground state, or in some


838
0:41:42,14 --> 0:41:44,31
long-lived, excited state.


839
0:41:44,31 --> 0:41:46,4
And if I want to read out the
state of the qubit, that's


840
0:41:46,4 --> 0:41:47,47
actually pretty easy.


841
0:41:47,47 --> 0:41:52,29
We can illuminate the ions
with laser light.


842
0:41:52,29 --> 0:41:56,4
And if we choose the frequency
of the light suitably, then


843
0:41:56,4 --> 0:41:58,61
the ions will remain dark
it they're in the green


844
0:41:58,61 --> 0:42:0,28
state of the qubit.


845
0:42:0,28 --> 0:42:2,37
If they're in the red state,
they will interact strongly


846
0:42:2,37 --> 0:42:4,1
with the light and fluoresce.


847
0:42:4,1 --> 0:42:6,17
So they'll glow visibly.


848
0:42:6,17 --> 0:42:9,53
And we can read out a series
of 0s and 1s that way, when


849
0:42:9,53 --> 0:42:12,27
we're ready to read out
our quantum computer.


850
0:42:12,27 --> 0:42:14,3
But, of course, we want to do
more than just read out.


851
0:42:14,3 --> 0:42:16,62
We want to be able to process
the information.


852
0:42:16,62 --> 0:42:18,38
So we have to be able
to perform logic


853
0:42:18,38 --> 0:42:21,12
gates on pairs of qubits.


854
0:42:21,12 --> 0:42:22,475
We've got to get the
qubits to interact.


855
0:42:22,475 --> 0:42:26,73
And in this case, we would use
the electrostatic repulsion


856
0:42:26,73 --> 0:42:29,71
between ions for that purpose.


857
0:42:29,71 --> 0:42:30,93
We can do something like this.


858
0:42:30,93 --> 0:42:34,31
I can pick out an ion in a trap
and address it with a


859
0:42:34,31 --> 0:42:37,84
pulse laser, choose the
frequency and duration of that


860
0:42:37,84 --> 0:42:40,9
laser pulse properly so that
if the ion is in the red


861
0:42:40,9 --> 0:42:42,52
state, nothing will happen.


862
0:42:42,52 --> 0:42:45,76
If it's in the green state,
the ion makes a transition


863
0:42:45,76 --> 0:42:47,83
from the green to
the red state.


864
0:42:47,83 --> 0:42:50,4
And at the same time, because
of those interactions, a


865
0:42:50,4 --> 0:42:54,55
vibrational mode of all the ions
in the trap is excited.


866
0:42:54,55 --> 0:42:57,57
And then I can pick out another
ion in the trap and


867
0:42:57,57 --> 0:43:0,7
address it with the pulse laser,
choose the frequency


868
0:43:0,7 --> 0:43:3,29
and duration of that pulse in
such a way that nothing will


869
0:43:3,29 --> 0:43:5,73
happen if the ions are
not vibrating.


870
0:43:5,73 --> 0:43:8,73
But if they are vibrating,
that ion will undergo a


871
0:43:8,73 --> 0:43:11,18
transition from one state
to the other and the


872
0:43:11,18 --> 0:43:13,13
vibration will stop.


873
0:43:13,13 --> 0:43:14,4
So what I've done is
I've picked out


874
0:43:14,4 --> 0:43:16,95
two ions in the trap.


875
0:43:16,95 --> 0:43:19,56
And if the first ion
had been red,


876
0:43:19,56 --> 0:43:20,89
nothing would have happened.


877
0:43:20,89 --> 0:43:23,88
If it's green, then both
ions make a transition.


878
0:43:23,88 --> 0:43:27,22
And so if I start out with a
superposition of red and green


879
0:43:27,22 --> 0:43:30,29
for the first ion, I get a
correlated quantum state, an


880
0:43:30,29 --> 0:43:33,23
entangled pair of qubits
for the pair of ions.


881
0:43:33,23 --> 0:43:36,33
And the quantum computation
would consist of many such


882
0:43:36,33 --> 0:43:39,8
steps, each one an entangling
operation acting


883
0:43:39,8 --> 0:43:41,27
on a pair of ions.


884
0:43:41,27 --> 0:43:44,36
At least that cartoon is the way
a theorist would describe


885
0:43:44,36 --> 0:43:46,52
what goes on in Wineland's
lab.


886
0:43:46,52 --> 0:43:50,2
If you go to his lab at NIST in
Boulder, Colorado and look


887
0:43:50,2 --> 0:43:51,72
around, you're in for
kind of a shock.


888
0:43:51,72 --> 0:43:55,28
Because underlying that cartoon
is a great deal of


889
0:43:55,28 --> 0:43:59,41
technical complexity, which
might make you pessimistic


890
0:43:59,41 --> 0:44:2,29
about the prospects for scaling
up ion traps to


891
0:44:2,29 --> 0:44:5,25
thousands or millions
of qubits.


892
0:44:5,25 --> 0:44:7,3
Well, it's going to be
very, very hard.


893
0:44:7,3 --> 0:44:11,19
Wineland and others have an
idea of how to do it.


894
0:44:11,19 --> 0:44:14,9
But it looks very difficult.


895
0:44:14,9 --> 0:44:16,9
We don't know whether that
will succeed or not.


896
0:44:16,9 --> 0:44:18,71
On the other hand, there are
other ways of realizing qubits


897
0:44:18,71 --> 0:44:21,89
physically, which are making
rapid progress.


898
0:44:21,89 --> 0:44:24,21
One makes use of
superconductivity again, but


899
0:44:24,21 --> 0:44:26,32
in a different way than I
described in the case with


900
0:44:26,32 --> 0:44:28,5
Mayorana fermions.


901
0:44:28,5 --> 0:44:30,85
We can use superconducting
wires to store quantum


902
0:44:30,85 --> 0:44:31,52
information.


903
0:44:31,52 --> 0:44:34,89
And although for practical
reasons this isn't the best


904
0:44:34,89 --> 0:44:37,89
way to do it, and you'll learn
about better ways to do it


905
0:44:37,89 --> 0:44:44,7
when John Martinez is here in
a month or two, you can


906
0:44:44,7 --> 0:44:47,28
visualize how we could store
information by thinking of a


907
0:44:47,28 --> 0:44:50,15
closed loop of superconducting
wire with a


908
0:44:50,15 --> 0:44:52,28
persistent current flowing.


909
0:44:52,28 --> 0:44:54,25
And the current can flow
either clockwise or


910
0:44:54,25 --> 0:44:55,76
counterclockwise around
the hoop.


911
0:44:55,76 --> 0:44:57,15
Those are the two
distinguishable


912
0:44:57,15 --> 0:44:58,82
states of the qubit.


913
0:44:58,82 --> 0:45:1,26
And what's remarkable about
that encoding is that the


914
0:45:1,26 --> 0:45:4,99
information is encoded in a
collective state of billions


915
0:45:4,99 --> 0:45:6,1
of electrons.


916
0:45:6,1 --> 0:45:10,38
And yet, we can treat it like
a single unit of quantum


917
0:45:10,38 --> 0:45:13,26
information and protect it
and manipulate it quite


918
0:45:13,26 --> 0:45:14,61
accurately.


919
0:45:14,61 --> 0:45:17,6
Another possibility is to use a
single electron, which has a


920
0:45:17,6 --> 0:45:22,59
magnetic field, a spin, where
its north pole can be oriented


921
0:45:22,59 --> 0:45:23,59
either up or down.


922
0:45:23,59 --> 0:45:24,965
So that's a qubit.


923
0:45:24,965 --> 0:45:27,76
And what's remarkable about that
encoding is it's just one


924
0:45:27,76 --> 0:45:28,71
little electron.


925
0:45:28,71 --> 0:45:33,44
But yet we can address it,
prepare its state, manipulate


926
0:45:33,44 --> 0:45:37,13
its state, get two such qubits
to interact with a good


927
0:45:37,13 --> 0:45:38,875
accuracy using current
technology.


928
0:45:38,875 --> 0:45:41,64
And both of these technologies
have been advancing


929
0:45:41,64 --> 0:45:44,24
impressively in the last
couple of years.


930
0:45:44,24 --> 0:45:46,53
And there are a number of
others, a number of other ways


931
0:45:46,53 --> 0:45:50,1
that have been proposed and
are under development for


932
0:45:50,1 --> 0:45:52,9
proceeding with building
quantum hardware.


933
0:45:52,9 --> 0:45:54,93
And we just don't know at this
stage which of these is going


934
0:45:54,93 --> 0:45:55,46
to turn out.


935
0:45:55,46 --> 0:45:57,94
Or maybe it'll be none of these
and some other idea that


936
0:45:57,94 --> 0:45:59,5
hasn't been proposed yet.


937
0:45:59,5 --> 0:46:2,31
Each of these technologies has
advantages and disadvantages.


938
0:46:2,31 --> 0:46:6,22
Perhaps the systems of the
future will use hybrid


939
0:46:6,22 --> 0:46:8,96
technologies, where we combine
together different types of


940
0:46:8,96 --> 0:46:14,24
qubits so we can take advantage
of the strong points


941
0:46:14,24 --> 0:46:15,49
of each of these technologies.


942
0:46:15,49 --> 0:46:18,45



943
0:46:18,45 --> 0:46:21,23
No matter how we build the
hardware, we're going to have


944
0:46:21,23 --> 0:46:23,72
to do error correction, as
I described earlier.


945
0:46:23,72 --> 0:46:26,87
And actually the best idea we
have about how to do this


946
0:46:26,87 --> 0:46:30,8
error correction in a reasonably
efficient manner


947
0:46:30,8 --> 0:46:33,55
goes back to these topological
encodings of information that


948
0:46:33,55 --> 0:46:34,36
I mentioned.


949
0:46:34,36 --> 0:46:37,44
The best idea we have is that
if you're going to use ions,


950
0:46:37,44 --> 0:46:41,36
or electron spins, or
superconducting circuits, you


951
0:46:41,36 --> 0:46:44,98
can, by getting such systems
to interact in a prescribed


952
0:46:44,98 --> 0:46:48,87
way, make them behave like these
topological media that I


953
0:46:48,87 --> 0:46:50,93
described, that support
anyons.


954
0:46:50,93 --> 0:46:53,46
And so we can use that
system to store


955
0:46:53,46 --> 0:46:56,57
quantum information robustly.


956
0:46:56,57 --> 0:47:0,3
But that will only work
effectively if our gates are


957
0:47:0,3 --> 0:47:0,84
good enough.


958
0:47:0,84 --> 0:47:4,93
We have to have a low enough
rate of error per gate in


959
0:47:4,93 --> 0:47:8,48
order for these error
correction ideas to


960
0:47:8,48 --> 0:47:11,94
effectively protect a quantum
computer against the damaging


961
0:47:11,94 --> 0:47:13,34
effects of noise.


962
0:47:13,34 --> 0:47:17,35
We would like the probability
of error per gate to be


963
0:47:17,35 --> 0:47:21,89
considerably less than 1% in
order to have reasonably


964
0:47:21,89 --> 0:47:23,99
efficient error correction
schemes.


965
0:47:23,99 --> 0:47:26,55
And the hardware is advancing
and getting into that


966
0:47:26,55 --> 0:47:30,34
interesting regime where we can
do two qubit gates with


967
0:47:30,34 --> 0:47:32,77
the required accuracy
for quantum error


968
0:47:32,77 --> 0:47:37,5
correction to be effective.


969
0:47:37,5 --> 0:47:40,68
So how far do we have to go
before we can build factoring


970
0:47:40,68 --> 0:47:45,7
machines that can really
outperform what can be done


971
0:47:45,7 --> 0:47:45,945
with classical computers?


972
0:47:45,945 --> 0:47:49,5
Well, let's say we want to break
the RSA scheme as it's


973
0:47:49,5 --> 0:47:51,3
usually implemented
these days.


974
0:47:51,3 --> 0:47:55,7
That means we have to factor
a 2048-bit number.


975
0:47:55,7 --> 0:47:57,3
Well, you know you can do that
with a classical computer.


976
0:47:57,3 --> 0:48:0,18
It's just question
of resources.


977
0:48:0,18 --> 0:48:2,35
John Martinez has done these
estimates, which I'm


978
0:48:2,35 --> 0:48:4,36
stealing from him.


979
0:48:4,36 --> 0:48:7,83
If you want to factor a 2048-bit
number, then you just


980
0:48:7,83 --> 0:48:11,29
have to cover 1/4 of the land
area of North America with a


981
0:48:11,29 --> 0:48:12,53
server farm.


982
0:48:12,53 --> 0:48:15,655
Now, that would cost about a
million trillion dollars.


983
0:48:15,655 --> 0:48:18,63
The power requirement would be
about a million terawatts,


984
0:48:18,63 --> 0:48:21,26
which is about 100,000
times the world's


985
0:48:21,26 --> 0:48:23,46
power output today.


986
0:48:23,46 --> 0:48:25,97
The bad news is you have to run
the algorithm for 10 years


987
0:48:25,97 --> 0:48:28,93
to get the answer and it would
consume the world's supply of


988
0:48:28,93 --> 0:48:31,7
fossil fuels in a day.


989
0:48:31,7 --> 0:48:34,87
So what if you tried to do this
with the existing quantum


990
0:48:34,87 --> 0:48:39,3
technology, which Martinez has
been a leader in developing?


991
0:48:39,3 --> 0:48:41,2
Well, we just do it
by brute force.


992
0:48:41,2 --> 0:48:43,71
If we want to factor this
number, we need something like


993
0:48:43,71 --> 0:48:47,43
10,000 logical qubits,
error-free qubits.


994
0:48:47,43 --> 0:48:50,1
In order to achieve that, based
on the types of error


995
0:48:50,1 --> 0:48:53,83
rates that we think are
achievable or nearly


996
0:48:53,83 --> 0:48:56,15
achievable with the current
technology, we would need


997
0:48:56,15 --> 0:48:59,69
about 10 million physical
qubits, keep them far enough


998
0:48:59,69 --> 0:49:1,8
apart so we have lots
of room to cool them


999
0:49:1,8 --> 0:49:3,43
and bring in wires.


1000
0:49:3,43 --> 0:49:6,68
And then the current cost,
Martinez estimates, of making


1001
0:49:6,68 --> 0:49:10,86
a really good qubit in his
lab is about $10,000.


1002
0:49:10,86 --> 0:49:14,62
So we could get these 10 million
physical qubits if we


1003
0:49:14,62 --> 0:49:17,27
were willing to spend
a $100 billion.


1004
0:49:17,27 --> 0:49:21,5
And then we could run the
algorithm in 16 hours.


1005
0:49:21,5 --> 0:49:23,34
It would consume 10 megawatts.


1006
0:49:23,34 --> 0:49:23,75
OK.


1007
0:49:23,75 --> 0:49:26,87
So actually this is a somewhat
rosier outlook than maybe the


1008
0:49:26,87 --> 0:49:29,57
current situation because it's
such a huge engineering


1009
0:49:29,57 --> 0:49:31,72
challenge to scale things
out when we don't know


1010
0:49:31,72 --> 0:49:33,51
exactly how to do it.


1011
0:49:33,51 --> 0:49:38,14
But it indicates that we can
imagine in coming decades that


1012
0:49:38,14 --> 0:49:40,28
this can really be a practical
technology.


1013
0:49:40,28 --> 0:49:42,296
We've just got to bring
the cost down a


1014
0:49:42,296 --> 0:49:44,42
bit, below $100 billion.


1015
0:49:44,42 --> 0:49:49,11
And you'll hear more about
that from Martinez.


1016
0:49:49,11 --> 0:49:50,97
So there are three questions
about quantum computers than


1017
0:49:50,97 --> 0:49:52,64
I've discussed so far.


1018
0:49:52,64 --> 0:49:53,97
Why do we want to build one?


1019
0:49:53,97 --> 0:49:56,24
Well, for one thing, because
quantum computers would be


1020
0:49:56,24 --> 0:49:59,98
able, perhaps, to simulate any
process that occurs in the


1021
0:49:59,98 --> 0:50:0,8
quantum world.


1022
0:50:0,8 --> 0:50:3,92
That could be important in
chemistry, and material


1023
0:50:3,92 --> 0:50:6,37
science, and from a physicist's
point of view, in


1024
0:50:6,37 --> 0:50:10,38
simulating exotic physical
phenomenon, that particle


1025
0:50:10,38 --> 0:50:14,61
physicists like me, or like
I used to be, care about.


1026
0:50:14,61 --> 0:50:15,9
Can we really build one?


1027
0:50:15,9 --> 0:50:18,32
Well, we don't know of an
obstacle in principle that


1028
0:50:18,32 --> 0:50:21,54
will prevent us from succeeding,
if we use these


1029
0:50:21,54 --> 0:50:23,92
principles of quantum
correction, and we can make


1030
0:50:23,92 --> 0:50:24,96
the hardware good enough.


1031
0:50:24,96 --> 0:50:27,51
And as far as we can tell,
it ought to work.


1032
0:50:27,51 --> 0:50:28,62
How are we going to do it?


1033
0:50:28,62 --> 0:50:29,88
That's still far from clear.


1034
0:50:29,88 --> 0:50:34,0
These different approaches to
quantum hardware that I


1035
0:50:34,0 --> 0:50:36,94
quickly summarized for you
are all being developed.


1036
0:50:36,94 --> 0:50:38,4
It's important that they
all be developed.


1037
0:50:38,4 --> 0:50:41,46
Because we really don't know
which is going to turn out, if


1038
0:50:41,46 --> 0:50:46,21
any of them, to be the best
scalable technology.


1039
0:50:46,21 --> 0:50:48,46
But you know, I am
not an engineer.


1040
0:50:48,46 --> 0:50:49,72
I'm a theoretical physicist.


1041
0:50:49,72 --> 0:50:54,52
So I get excited about the
potential ways in which what


1042
0:50:54,52 --> 0:50:57,62
we're learning by thinking about
quantum computing can be


1043
0:50:57,62 --> 0:51:2,23
applied to problems at the
frontiers of physics.


1044
0:51:2,23 --> 0:51:4,52
And there are many applications
of quantum


1045
0:51:4,52 --> 0:51:7,28
information processing
to physics.


1046
0:51:7,28 --> 0:51:10,25
Many of them have to do with
what we call the monogamy of


1047
0:51:10,25 --> 0:51:13,77
entanglement, a difference
between classical and quantum


1048
0:51:13,77 --> 0:51:17,85
correlations that I haven't
emphasized so much so far.


1049
0:51:17,85 --> 0:51:20,48
Classical correlations
are polygamous.


1050
0:51:20,48 --> 0:51:23,48
They can be shared
by many parties.


1051
0:51:23,48 --> 0:51:26,85
Adam and Betty both read
the newspaper.


1052
0:51:26,85 --> 0:51:28,4
They have the same
information.


1053
0:51:28,4 --> 0:51:30,65
They become correlated
with one another.


1054
0:51:30,65 --> 0:51:33,62
And nothing prevents
Charlie from


1055
0:51:33,62 --> 0:51:35,1
reading that same newspaper.


1056
0:51:35,1 --> 0:51:36,67
So now, all three of them
are correlated.


1057
0:51:36,67 --> 0:51:39,11
And Charlie is just as strongly
correlated with Betty


1058
0:51:39,11 --> 0:51:42,46
and with Adam, as Adam and Betty
are with one another.


1059
0:51:42,46 --> 0:51:44,72
And the rest of us in the room
can read the newspaper.


1060
0:51:44,72 --> 0:51:47,88
And everybody joins in
on the correlation.


1061
0:51:47,88 --> 0:51:49,53
Quantum correlations
are different.


1062
0:51:49,53 --> 0:51:51,6
We say they are monogamous.


1063
0:51:51,6 --> 0:51:53,8
They are harder to share.


1064
0:51:53,8 --> 0:51:57,77
If Adam and Betty are strongly
entangled, if they are fully


1065
0:51:57,77 --> 0:52:1,19
entangled, as entangled as
possible with one another,


1066
0:52:1,19 --> 0:52:4,52
then neither Adam nor Betty
has the ability to be


1067
0:52:4,52 --> 0:52:8,27
correlated with any
other system.


1068
0:52:8,27 --> 0:52:12,22
Likewise, if Betty is fully
entangled with Charlie, then


1069
0:52:12,22 --> 0:52:17,32
Betty and Charlie cannot be
correlated at all with Adam.


1070
0:52:17,32 --> 0:52:20,58
So that's what we mean when
we say the entanglement is


1071
0:52:20,58 --> 0:52:21,24
monogamous.


1072
0:52:21,24 --> 0:52:24,32
It can be shared two ways.


1073
0:52:24,32 --> 0:52:27,42
And that monogamy can be
frustrating because Betty


1074
0:52:27,42 --> 0:52:31,6
might want to be entangled with
both Adam and Charlie.


1075
0:52:31,6 --> 0:52:33,98
But if she wants to entangle
with Charlie, she has to


1076
0:52:33,98 --> 0:52:36,8
sacrifice some of her
entanglement with Adam in


1077
0:52:36,8 --> 0:52:38,93
order to do so.


1078
0:52:38,93 --> 0:52:43,32
That feature, that monogamy
of entanglement, has many


1079
0:52:43,32 --> 0:52:44,69
ramifications.


1080
0:52:44,69 --> 0:52:47,29
One is in quantum
cryptography.


1081
0:52:47,29 --> 0:52:51,72
If Adam and Betty are nearly
fully entangled with one


1082
0:52:51,72 --> 0:52:54,66
another, if they can verify
they are very highly


1083
0:52:54,66 --> 0:52:58,4
entangled, for example by
playing Bell's game and


1084
0:52:58,4 --> 0:53:1,49
winning, and then they will
know that they have very


1085
0:53:1,49 --> 0:53:4,56
little correlation with anyone
in the outside world who would


1086
0:53:4,56 --> 0:53:6,93
be a potential eavesdropper.


1087
0:53:6,93 --> 0:53:8,93
They can use their entanglement
to generate a


1088
0:53:8,93 --> 0:53:12,62
secret key that they share, a
random string of numbers that


1089
0:53:12,62 --> 0:53:15,87
Adam has and Betty has, but
which the outside world knows


1090
0:53:15,87 --> 0:53:16,96
very little about.


1091
0:53:16,96 --> 0:53:19,75
And then with a little bit of
processing, they can amplify


1092
0:53:19,75 --> 0:53:24,32
that privacy so that they are
assured that the world outside


1093
0:53:24,32 --> 0:53:25,68
knows nothing about their key.


1094
0:53:25,68 --> 0:53:28,9
And they can safely use it
to encrypt and decrypt a


1095
0:53:28,9 --> 0:53:31,3
classical message.


1096
0:53:31,3 --> 0:53:34,74
With information theoretic
security, no attack by the


1097
0:53:34,74 --> 0:53:39,46
eavesdropper will succeed in
breaking such a protocol.


1098
0:53:39,46 --> 0:53:43,27
Monogamy is very important in
the study of quantum matter.


1099
0:53:43,27 --> 0:53:45,5
We might have a system
of many electrons.


1100
0:53:45,5 --> 0:53:47,98
And the interactions among the
electron make them want to


1101
0:53:47,98 --> 0:53:49,56
entangle with one another.


1102
0:53:49,56 --> 0:53:52,96
But if electron A is to entangle
with electron B, then


1103
0:53:52,96 --> 0:53:55,67
it's going to give up some of
its ability to entangle with


1104
0:53:55,67 --> 0:53:57,37
other electrons in the
system that it


1105
0:53:57,37 --> 0:53:58,94
wants to entangle with.


1106
0:53:58,94 --> 0:54:3,98
And so the system will have to
arrive at some compromise to


1107
0:54:3,98 --> 0:54:7,27
relieve that frustration, that
inability to entangle with


1108
0:54:7,27 --> 0:54:10,86
many particles at once to the
best degree possible.


1109
0:54:10,86 --> 0:54:15,1
And there are qualitatively
different ways in which the


1110
0:54:15,1 --> 0:54:19,74
many-body state can find and
entangled a state of matter,


1111
0:54:19,74 --> 0:54:22,81
which correspond to different
phases of matter, that can't


1112
0:54:22,81 --> 0:54:25,53
be smoothly changed
one to another.


1113
0:54:25,53 --> 0:54:28,45
Classifying the different phases
of quantum matter is


1114
0:54:28,45 --> 0:54:30,84
really a problem in
understanding the types of


1115
0:54:30,84 --> 0:54:34,33
entanglement that can be shared
by many particles.


1116
0:54:34,33 --> 0:54:37,5
And monogamy is also important
in the study of black hole


1117
0:54:37,5 --> 0:54:40,77
physics, which has been a
subject that's been quite


1118
0:54:40,77 --> 0:54:42,73
active over the last
year or so.


1119
0:54:42,73 --> 0:54:44,59
Let me just take a few minutes
to tell you about


1120
0:54:44,59 --> 0:54:46,92
what's been going on.


1121
0:54:46,92 --> 0:54:49,91
Actually, we've known for a long
time, nearly 40 years,


1122
0:54:49,91 --> 0:54:52,29
that black holes, although
classically they are objects


1123
0:54:52,29 --> 0:54:56,45
from which nothing can escape,
actually emit radiation


1124
0:54:56,45 --> 0:54:57,63
because of quantum effects.


1125
0:54:57,63 --> 0:55:1,25
We think a black hole, if it
forms from a collapse of


1126
0:55:1,25 --> 0:55:5,68
matter, will eventually
evaporate completely through


1127
0:55:5,68 --> 0:55:9,19
this emission of Hawking
radiation.


1128
0:55:9,19 --> 0:55:13,29
And normally when systems get
thermalized and behave like


1129
0:55:13,29 --> 0:55:15,74
they have some characteristic
temperature and radiate, like


1130
0:55:15,74 --> 0:55:20,51
black holes do, we believe
that such processes are


1131
0:55:20,51 --> 0:55:22,48
microscopically reversible.


1132
0:55:22,48 --> 0:55:25,3
In principle, they could
be run backwards.


1133
0:55:25,3 --> 0:55:27,79
Information doesn't really
get destroyed.


1134
0:55:27,79 --> 0:55:30,58
But it gets scrambled, put
into a form which is


1135
0:55:30,58 --> 0:55:31,97
very hard to decode.


1136
0:55:31,97 --> 0:55:34,15
But which, in principle,
can be decoded.


1137
0:55:34,15 --> 0:55:37,1
So we think, black holes, like
other quantum systems, ought


1138
0:55:37,1 --> 0:55:41,42
not to destroy information, just
scramble it, making it


1139
0:55:41,42 --> 0:55:43,1
hard to decode.


1140
0:55:43,1 --> 0:55:45,21
But black holes are different
than other systems in an


1141
0:55:45,21 --> 0:55:45,99
important way.


1142
0:55:45,99 --> 0:55:48,61
They have a highly deformed
geometry, which I've tried to


1143
0:55:48,61 --> 0:55:50,64
indicate here in this diagram.


1144
0:55:50,64 --> 0:55:52,77
Here, time is running upward.


1145
0:55:52,77 --> 0:55:57,66
This black line represents the
event horizon, the boundary


1146
0:55:57,66 --> 0:56:0,62
between the outside and the
inside of a black hole.


1147
0:56:0,62 --> 0:56:4,41
And this green line is a
slice of constant time,


1148
0:56:4,41 --> 0:56:5,91
a space-like surface.


1149
0:56:5,91 --> 0:56:8,17
But just think of it as
one particular time.


1150
0:56:8,17 --> 0:56:11,71
But because of the distorted
geometry, it has


1151
0:56:11,71 --> 0:56:13,3
this unusual shape.


1152
0:56:13,3 --> 0:56:15,57
Which means that the collapsing
matter from which


1153
0:56:15,57 --> 0:56:19,14
the black hole form, and most
of the outgoing Hawking


1154
0:56:19,14 --> 0:56:22,73
radiation emitted as the black
hole evaporates, are at the


1155
0:56:22,73 --> 0:56:26,76
same time, cross the single
space-like slice.


1156
0:56:26,76 --> 0:56:29,45
And so if information really
comes out of a black hole in a


1157
0:56:29,45 --> 0:56:32,44
highly scrambled form, it means
information at the same


1158
0:56:32,44 --> 0:56:35,11
time is at two different places,
inside the black hole


1159
0:56:35,11 --> 0:56:35,71
and outside.


1160
0:56:35,71 --> 0:56:38,74
But remember, I told you that
we can't copy quantum


1161
0:56:38,74 --> 0:56:39,92
information.


1162
0:56:39,92 --> 0:56:41,18
So we're kind of stuck here.


1163
0:56:41,18 --> 0:56:44,39
If black holes don't destroy
information, then it seems


1164
0:56:44,39 --> 0:56:46,47
that they are a quantum
copying machine.


1165
0:56:46,47 --> 0:56:49,44
That they were able to clone
a quantum state, taking the


1166
0:56:49,44 --> 0:56:52,2
information encoded in the
collapsing matter and printing


1167
0:56:52,2 --> 0:56:54,165
it in this outgoing
Hawking radiation.


1168
0:56:54,165 --> 0:56:56,86
And that caused great
puzzlement.


1169
0:56:56,86 --> 0:57:0,68
But for about 20 years, we have
had an idea about how the


1170
0:57:0,68 --> 0:57:5,12
situation is resolved, which
is called black hole


1171
0:57:5,12 --> 0:57:6,8
complementarity.


1172
0:57:6,8 --> 0:57:8,55
It's a kind of crazy idea.


1173
0:57:8,55 --> 0:57:15,47
It is that we should not think
of the outside system, the


1174
0:57:15,47 --> 0:57:18,59
Hawking radiation, and the
inside system, the collapsing


1175
0:57:18,59 --> 0:57:22,92
matter, as two different
parts of a big system.


1176
0:57:22,92 --> 0:57:26,38
We should think of them as
two complementary ways of


1177
0:57:26,38 --> 0:57:28,2
describing the same system.


1178
0:57:28,2 --> 0:57:31,21
There's, so to speak, door
number one and door number two


1179
0:57:31,21 --> 0:57:34,53
of black hole physics, two
complementary descriptions of


1180
0:57:34,53 --> 0:57:36,58
the same system.


1181
0:57:36,58 --> 0:57:39,49
And that's not at all obvious.


1182
0:57:39,49 --> 0:57:43,76
And that we actually need to
understand the black holes


1183
0:57:43,76 --> 0:57:47,21
better to clarify exactly
why it occurs.


1184
0:57:47,21 --> 0:57:49,99
But the idea is that this
isn't really cloning.


1185
0:57:49,99 --> 0:57:50,77
It's just we have two


1186
0:57:50,77 --> 0:57:52,24
descriptions of the same physics.


1187
0:57:52,24 --> 0:57:55,12
One is appropriate for someone
who falls into the black hole,


1188
0:57:55,12 --> 0:57:56,8
the description of the
information in


1189
0:57:56,8 --> 0:57:58,26
the collapsing body.


1190
0:57:58,26 --> 0:58:1,6
The other is appropriate for
someone who stays outside.


1191
0:58:1,6 --> 0:58:2,57
That's the information
imprinted


1192
0:58:2,57 --> 0:58:4,1
in the Hawking radiation.


1193
0:58:4,1 --> 0:58:7,97
This idea of a black hole
complementarity is intended to


1194
0:58:7,97 --> 0:58:11,16
reconcile three beliefs
which seem reasonable.


1195
0:58:11,16 --> 0:58:12,88
Black holes don't destroy
information.


1196
0:58:12,88 --> 0:58:15,34
They merely scramble it.


1197
0:58:15,34 --> 0:58:19,42
Secondly, that an observer who
falls through the horizon, the


1198
0:58:19,42 --> 0:58:21,99
boundary between inside and
outside of a black hole,


1199
0:58:21,99 --> 0:58:24,95
doesn't notice anything unusual
upon entering the


1200
0:58:24,95 --> 0:58:26,12
black hole.


1201
0:58:26,12 --> 0:58:27,1
Everything seems normal.


1202
0:58:27,1 --> 0:58:31,6
Until later on, when the party
will inevitably be torn apart


1203
0:58:31,6 --> 0:58:34,51
by very strong gravitational
forces, deep


1204
0:58:34,51 --> 0:58:36,57
inside the black hole.


1205
0:58:36,57 --> 0:58:39,95
And physics seems perfectly
normal from the point of view


1206
0:58:39,95 --> 0:58:43,27
of someone who stays outside
the black hole.


1207
0:58:43,27 --> 0:58:46,57
But what has recently been
argued is that these three


1208
0:58:46,57 --> 0:58:49,82
things can't simultaneously
be true.


1209
0:58:49,82 --> 0:58:51,4
And the problem is this.


1210
0:58:51,4 --> 0:58:53,29
That if we consider an old black
hole, which has been


1211
0:58:53,29 --> 0:58:56,4
radiated for a long time,
information is starting to


1212
0:58:56,4 --> 0:58:58,3
leak out of it we
it evaporates.


1213
0:58:58,3 --> 0:59:2,34
That means that the recently
emitted radiation, system B,


1214
0:59:2,34 --> 0:59:5,29
has to be highly entangled
with radiation that was


1215
0:59:5,29 --> 0:59:8,17
emitted earlier, which
I called system C.


1216
0:59:8,17 --> 0:59:10,71
But we also know that if a
freely falling observer,


1217
0:59:10,71 --> 0:59:13,57
falling through the horizon,
sees not a lot of particles,


1218
0:59:13,57 --> 0:59:16,57
but something that just looks
like empty space, empty space


1219
0:59:16,57 --> 0:59:19,19
actually has a lot of
entanglement between and


1220
0:59:19,19 --> 0:59:23,22
outside the black hole, B, and
the region inside, A. So this


1221
0:59:23,22 --> 0:59:26,28
recently emitted radiation has
to be highly entangled with


1222
0:59:26,28 --> 0:59:27,52
the inside of the black hole.


1223
0:59:27,52 --> 0:59:29,85
It also has to be
highly entangled


1224
0:59:29,85 --> 0:59:31,24
with earlier radiation.


1225
0:59:31,24 --> 0:59:32,52
And that's a problem.


1226
0:59:32,52 --> 0:59:35,55
Because system B can't be highly
entangled with both A


1227
0:59:35,55 --> 0:59:38,14
and C. That violates monogamy.


1228
0:59:38,14 --> 0:59:40,97
And so we're really confused
about what this means.


1229
0:59:40,97 --> 0:59:44,5
What has been suggested is
that we should give up on


1230
0:59:44,5 --> 0:59:47,9
assumption 2, that freely
falling observers don't think


1231
0:59:47,9 --> 0:59:51,51
everything is smooth and nice
and normal when they cross


1232
0:59:51,51 --> 0:59:53,5
from the outside to the inside
in the black hole.


1233
0:59:53,5 --> 0:59:55,29
In fact, there is no inside.


1234
0:59:55,29 --> 0:59:58,64
And they just hit a
seething firewall.


1235
0:59:58,64 --> 1:0:2,76
The singularity, where you get
torn apart, is actually right


1236
1:0:2,76 --> 1:0:4,13
at the horizon.


1237
1:0:4,13 --> 1:0:8,24
That's the suggestion which has
been promoted recently.


1238
1:0:8,24 --> 1:0:8,96
And it's crazy.


1239
1:0:8,96 --> 1:0:12,3
Because if you just solve
the equations of general


1240
1:0:12,3 --> 1:0:14,6
relativity to see what the
geometry of a black hole


1241
1:0:14,6 --> 1:0:16,36
should be, that's not
what you find.


1242
1:0:16,36 --> 1:0:21,4
You find in fact the geometry
should be very smooth as you


1243
1:0:21,4 --> 1:0:22,7
cross the horizon.


1244
1:0:22,7 --> 1:0:24,23
So we're really confused
about this.


1245
1:0:24,23 --> 1:0:27,59
The reason I'm telling you about
it is that this debate


1246
1:0:27,59 --> 1:0:29,11
could have occurred
20 years ago.


1247
1:0:29,11 --> 1:0:32,43
But it's occurring now I think
because the gravitational


1248
1:0:32,43 --> 1:0:35,2
physicists and string theorists
are more accustomed


1249
1:0:35,2 --> 1:0:38,58
now to thinking about their
physical systems from the


1250
1:0:38,58 --> 1:0:41,51
point of view of quantum
information and entanglement.


1251
1:0:41,51 --> 1:0:43,66
And that's a change which is
occurring throughout many


1252
1:0:43,66 --> 1:0:45,41
areas of physics.


1253
1:0:45,41 --> 1:0:47,37
Physics is a broad subject.


1254
1:0:47,37 --> 1:0:50,42
We have the frontier of short
distances, in which we study


1255
1:0:50,42 --> 1:0:53,44
the elementary particles and
their interactions; the


1256
1:0:53,44 --> 1:0:56,43
frontier of long distances,
the evolution of the whole


1257
1:0:56,43 --> 1:1:0,5
universe and the properties
of the early universe.


1258
1:1:0,5 --> 1:1:2,93
But there's another frontier,
also very exciting and very


1259
1:1:2,93 --> 1:1:5,6
active, which you could call
the complexity frontier or


1260
1:1:5,6 --> 1:1:9,5
entanglement frontier, the
study of highly entangled


1261
1:1:9,5 --> 1:1:11,7
systems with many parts.


1262
1:1:11,7 --> 1:1:13,18
That encompasses quantum
computing, trying to


1263
1:1:13,18 --> 1:1:15,77
understand phases of quantum
matter, and all the different


1264
1:1:15,77 --> 1:1:19,67
ways in which systems of many
particles can be entangled.


1265
1:1:19,67 --> 1:1:21,86
That's an area in which
we can expect great


1266
1:1:21,86 --> 1:1:24,31
progress in this century.


1267
1:1:24,31 --> 1:1:28,32
At Caltech, we have a center
devoted to the exploration of


1268
1:1:28,32 --> 1:1:31,72
this entanglement frontier
from many points of view.


1269
1:1:31,72 --> 1:1:37,6
And the IQIM has a slogan, which
is nature is subtle,


1270
1:1:37,6 --> 1:1:42,24
where we are playing on
Einstein's famous statement,


1271
1:1:42,24 --> 1:1:45,93
"Subtle is the Lord, but
malicious He is not."


1272
1:1:45,93 --> 1:1:49,81
Einstein, for all his audacity
and genius, underestimated the


1273
1:1:49,81 --> 1:1:52,65
subtlety of nature when he
dismissed quantum entanglement


1274
1:1:52,65 --> 1:1:55,13
as spooky action
at a distance.


1275
1:1:55,13 --> 1:1:57,77
And what we're trying to do in
quantum information science


1276
1:1:57,77 --> 1:2:2,33
these days is to enjoy and
relish and explore and exploit


1277
1:2:2,33 --> 1:2:6,1
ultimately the subtlety of the
quantum world and all its


1278
1:2:6,1 --> 1:2:7,82
facets and ramifications.


1279
1:2:7,82 --> 1:2:9,7
Thanks for listening
to me today.


1280
1:2:9,7 --> 1:2:17,99



1281
1:2:17,99 --> 1:2:19,12
AUDIENCE: So I remember--


1282
1:2:19,12 --> 1:2:22,9
I noticed thinking when you
were talking about how you


1283
1:2:22,9 --> 1:2:26,26
have to isolate the material,
the quantum computer, from


1284
1:2:26,26 --> 1:2:31,17
outside observation that my
immediate responses, and I


1285
1:2:31,17 --> 1:2:33,5
thought as an engineer, was
like man, that's got to be


1286
1:2:33,5 --> 1:2:37,52
really tough to debug if
something's going wrong.


1287
1:2:37,52 --> 1:2:40,64
So I was wondering so what are
the implications there for how


1288
1:2:40,64 --> 1:2:41,485
you would program it?


1289
1:2:41,485 --> 1:2:43,85
Do you have to have like a
mathematical proof that your


1290
1:2:43,85 --> 1:2:45,1
program is correct?


1291
1:2:45,1 --> 1:2:48,34
Because it doesn't seem like
you could examine what it's


1292
1:2:48,34 --> 1:2:49,59
doing when it's executing.


1293
1:2:49,59 --> 1:2:52,24



1294
1:2:52,24 --> 1:2:54,88
JOHN PRESKILL: So the question
is if what I said is true,


1295
1:2:54,88 --> 1:2:59,15
that in order for a quantum
computer to work it has to be


1296
1:2:59,15 --> 1:3:1,9
completely isolated from the
outside world and we're not


1297
1:3:1,9 --> 1:3:5,66
able to look inside at what it's
doing or in the course of


1298
1:3:5,66 --> 1:3:7,73
a computation, how would
we ever debug it?


1299
1:3:7,73 --> 1:3:9,7
How would we as--


1300
1:3:9,7 --> 1:3:10,98
or you as engineers--


1301
1:3:10,98 --> 1:3:15,58
manage to figure out how to
fix it when it's broken?


1302
1:3:15,58 --> 1:3:16,2
Well, the answer--


1303
1:3:16,2 --> 1:3:18,95
I mean I don't think there's
any answer that's


1304
1:3:18,95 --> 1:3:20,17
surprising to you.


1305
1:3:20,17 --> 1:3:24,17
You would have to, in the
process of developing a


1306
1:3:24,17 --> 1:3:29,35
quantum computer, benchmark
different subroutines by


1307
1:3:29,35 --> 1:3:31,35
running them and seeing how
well they performed.


1308
1:3:31,35 --> 1:3:32,47
You can break it all.


1309
1:3:32,47 --> 1:3:35,33
The big computation you can't
simulate with a classical


1310
1:3:35,33 --> 1:3:37,84
computer because that's the
whole reason you're building a


1311
1:3:37,84 --> 1:3:39,38
quantum computer.


1312
1:3:39,38 --> 1:3:41,68
The pieces of a computation,
you can simulate.


1313
1:3:41,68 --> 1:3:44,41
You can compare such simulations
to the operation


1314
1:3:44,41 --> 1:3:45,82
of the quantum hardware.


1315
1:3:45,82 --> 1:3:48,2
Then you can try to scale
up to larger and


1316
1:3:48,2 --> 1:3:49,4
larger quantum circuits.


1317
1:3:49,4 --> 1:3:52,67
And in cases where you're doing
computations for which


1318
1:3:52,67 --> 1:3:54,96
it is easy to know what the
answer is, make sure you're


1319
1:3:54,96 --> 1:3:55,86
getting the right answer.


1320
1:3:55,86 --> 1:4:0,94
If it's not working, then look
at the individual parts of


1321
1:4:0,94 --> 1:4:5,2
that circuit and try to improve
their performance.


1322
1:4:5,2 --> 1:4:6,48
And there's no deep
answer to that.


1323
1:4:6,48 --> 1:4:9,66
It's just sort of the
obvious answer.


1324
1:4:9,66 --> 1:4:13,66
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
earlier that quantum


1325
1:4:13,66 --> 1:4:16,26
techniques don't work equally
well on all problems.


1326
1:4:16,26 --> 1:4:19,22
Some of them give exponential
speedup, some of them only n


1327
1:4:19,22 --> 1:4:21,4
squared, that sort stuff.


1328
1:4:21,4 --> 1:4:24,9
I was wondering if you could
give any further intuition on


1329
1:4:24,9 --> 1:4:26,74
what kinds of problems fall
into the different?


1330
1:4:26,74 --> 1:4:26,98
JOHN PRESKILL: Yeah.


1331
1:4:26,98 --> 1:4:29,42
So I think the question is,
I said that there are some


1332
1:4:29,42 --> 1:4:34,5
problems that quantum computers
can achieve


1333
1:4:34,5 --> 1:4:38,35
spectacular speedups, many
problems for which we think


1334
1:4:38,35 --> 1:4:40,4
that's not possible.


1335
1:4:40,4 --> 1:4:44,21
And so what's the intuition
about whether a problem lies


1336
1:4:44,21 --> 1:4:47,28
in one class or the other
or what's a nice


1337
1:4:47,28 --> 1:4:48,73
characterization?


1338
1:4:48,73 --> 1:4:51,27
Well, we don't have the complete
answer to that.


1339
1:4:51,27 --> 1:4:56,78
I did say that we do not expect
exponential speedups to


1340
1:4:56,78 --> 1:5:1,31
be possible for NP-hard
problems.


1341
1:5:1,31 --> 1:5:6,95
We think that in such cases
even a quantum computer


1342
1:5:6,95 --> 1:5:10,645
wouldn't in the worst case be
able to do much better than a


1343
1:5:10,645 --> 1:5:11,53
brute force search.


1344
1:5:11,53 --> 1:5:14,36
And they can speed that up a
little bit, but not a lot


1345
1:5:14,36 --> 1:5:16,76
compared to classical systems.


1346
1:5:16,76 --> 1:5:19,54
So first of all, we're talking
about if we want to stay


1347
1:5:19,54 --> 1:5:24,21
within the class NP, where we
can check the answer easily


1348
1:5:24,21 --> 1:5:27,5
with a classical computer, about
a rather special class


1349
1:5:27,5 --> 1:5:30,1
of problems, which are outside
P. So they're classically


1350
1:5:30,1 --> 1:5:32,0
hard, but not NP-hard.


1351
1:5:32,0 --> 1:5:35,14
Factoring is a candidate
for being in the


1352
1:5:35,14 --> 1:5:36,21
intermediate class.


1353
1:5:36,21 --> 1:5:41,58
So other problems which are
outside P, which we think


1354
1:5:41,58 --> 1:5:43,94
can't be solved in polynomial
time with a classical


1355
1:5:43,94 --> 1:5:46,75
computer, but are not NP-hard,
are candidates for quantum


1356
1:5:46,75 --> 1:5:47,93
algorithms.


1357
1:5:47,93 --> 1:5:52,7
But that's probably not exactly
the right answer.


1358
1:5:52,7 --> 1:5:54,79
And I also tried to emphasize
that we don't have to limit


1359
1:5:54,79 --> 1:5:56,65
ourselves to NP.


1360
1:5:56,65 --> 1:5:59,12
There are things that quantum
computers could do that we


1361
1:5:59,12 --> 1:6:0,91
wouldn't be able to
check classically.


1362
1:6:0,91 --> 1:6:3,77
We could check a quantum
computer with another quantum


1363
1:6:3,77 --> 1:6:7,11
computer, things like
simulation problems,


1364
1:6:7,11 --> 1:6:10,3
simulating quantum systems
with many parts.


1365
1:6:10,3 --> 1:6:14,75
And I think the most potential
that we currently know from


1366
1:6:14,75 --> 1:6:17,62
our current understanding
of quantum computers for


1367
1:6:17,62 --> 1:6:20,69
nontrivial applications involve
such simulation of


1368
1:6:20,69 --> 1:6:23,13
quantum systems.


1369
1:6:23,13 --> 1:6:25,45
AUDIENCE: Could you say
something about the robustness


1370
1:6:25,45 --> 1:6:26,43
of entanglement?


1371
1:6:26,43 --> 1:6:29,8
So when you were talking about
quantum computing, it seemed


1372
1:6:29,8 --> 1:6:32,38
like entanglement was this
very delicate thing.


1373
1:6:32,38 --> 1:6:35,7
And you had to worry about the
decoherence problems that when


1374
1:6:35,7 --> 1:6:37,72
two particles interact with
the outside world, the


1375
1:6:37,72 --> 1:6:39,26
entanglement is lost.


1376
1:6:39,26 --> 1:6:41,28
But with this black hole
problem, it seems like the


1377
1:6:41,28 --> 1:6:42,77
entanglement was
indestructible.


1378
1:6:42,77 --> 1:6:44,42
And that was why these
three propositions


1379
1:6:44,42 --> 1:6:46,23
couldn't all be true.


1380
1:6:46,23 --> 1:6:49,1
JOHN PRESKILL: Well,
entanglement is


1381
1:6:49,1 --> 1:6:52,7
indestructible, even outside the
context of the black hole


1382
1:6:52,7 --> 1:6:58,99
problem, in the sense that if
you have systems that are


1383
1:6:58,99 --> 1:7:1,67
entangled with one another,
although they may interact


1384
1:7:1,67 --> 1:7:4,2
with the environment, that
doesn't really destroy the


1385
1:7:4,2 --> 1:7:5,5
entanglement.


1386
1:7:5,5 --> 1:7:8,3
It just means that the
entanglement can now only be


1387
1:7:8,3 --> 1:7:11,72
detected if we look at
entanglement between


1388
1:7:11,72 --> 1:7:14,45
subsystems that include
the environment.


1389
1:7:14,45 --> 1:7:16,21
So the problem is that
we don't control the


1390
1:7:16,21 --> 1:7:17,675
environment very well.


1391
1:7:17,675 --> 1:7:21,7
So if we look at just the system
that we can control and


1392
1:7:21,7 --> 1:7:23,55
don't pay attention to the
environment, then it can


1393
1:7:23,55 --> 1:7:26,27
appear that the entanglement
is lost, even though it's


1394
1:7:26,27 --> 1:7:27,58
really there.


1395
1:7:27,58 --> 1:7:30,5
In the case of the black hole
problem, I was really talking


1396
1:7:30,5 --> 1:7:32,66
about this issue of principle,
of whether entanglement is


1397
1:7:32,66 --> 1:7:35,9
there or not, not whether it's
there in a form that we can


1398
1:7:35,9 --> 1:7:38,5
control or even decode easily.


1399
1:7:38,5 --> 1:7:38,89
Which actually is an


1400
1:7:38,89 --> 1:7:40,79
interesting question of principle.


1401
1:7:40,79 --> 1:7:43,67
Is it a really hard problem to
do the decoding that could


1402
1:7:43,67 --> 1:7:45,31
detect this entanglement?


1403
1:7:45,31 --> 1:7:48,91
And if it's a really hard
problem, do maybe the laws of


1404
1:7:48,91 --> 1:7:54,67
physics tell us that this
entanglement doesn't really


1405
1:7:54,67 --> 1:7:57,17
have an operational meaning?


1406
1:7:57,17 --> 1:7:59,45
AUDIENCE: So it sounds like it
might be very difficult for


1407
1:7:59,45 --> 1:8:1,35
humans to build such
a computer.


1408
1:8:1,35 --> 1:8:7,35
Do such computers exist in
natural settings where some


1409
1:8:7,35 --> 1:8:13,64
spontaneous result appears
quite naturally, like for


1410
1:8:13,64 --> 1:8:18,979
instance in superconductivity
where some physical state is


1411
1:8:18,979 --> 1:8:23,49
just emergent from a large
group of particles.


1412
1:8:23,49 --> 1:8:26,34
And the way they actually are
doing it is a quantum


1413
1:8:26,34 --> 1:8:29,35
computer, but we don't know
how it's happening?


1414
1:8:29,35 --> 1:8:31,95



1415
1:8:31,95 --> 1:8:32,18
JOHN PRESKILL: Right.


1416
1:8:32,18 --> 1:8:39,18
So the question is for humans,
it may be hard to realize


1417
1:8:39,18 --> 1:8:41,95
large-scale quantum computers.


1418
1:8:41,95 --> 1:8:43,54
Are there ways in which
nature does it?


1419
1:8:43,54 --> 1:8:46,47
Are there natural processes in
which quantum computation


1420
1:8:46,47 --> 1:8:50,59
occurs, so-to-speak
spontaneously?


1421
1:8:50,59 --> 1:8:50,85
Yeah.


1422
1:8:50,85 --> 1:8:53,279
I mean it's sort of-- you know
it was hard for us to build a


1423
1:8:53,279 --> 1:8:54,109
hydrogen bomb.


1424
1:8:54,109 --> 1:8:55,59
But the Sun does it.


1425
1:8:55,59 --> 1:8:58,51
In fact, it was hard to build a
fission bomb, but there was


1426
1:8:58,51 --> 1:9:5,609
a spontaneous uranium reactor
in Africa because too much


1427
1:9:5,609 --> 1:9:7,72
uranium was collected
in one place.


1428
1:9:7,72 --> 1:9:12,649
So is quantum computation
occurring by such naturally


1429
1:9:12,649 --> 1:9:14,649
occurring process somewhere?


1430
1:9:14,649 --> 1:9:16,14
I don't know.


1431
1:9:16,14 --> 1:9:19,859
My guess is that if we really
want large-scale quantum


1432
1:9:19,859 --> 1:9:24,46
computers, which are hard to
simulate classically--


1433
1:9:24,46 --> 1:9:26,91
well, I mean there are lots of
things going on in physics


1434
1:9:26,91 --> 1:9:33,14
labs for which that might be a
fair statement, that there are


1435
1:9:33,14 --> 1:9:35,189
states of quantum matter.


1436
1:9:35,189 --> 1:9:38,62
One famous one is the
high-temperature


1437
1:9:38,62 --> 1:9:41,84
superconductors, which we don't
understand very well


1438
1:9:41,84 --> 1:9:44,93
microscopically how they work
because haven't so far been


1439
1:9:44,93 --> 1:9:50,38
able to simulate them on
classical computers.


1440
1:9:50,38 --> 1:9:54,95
So maybe that system is, by
simulating itself, is


1441
1:9:54,95 --> 1:9:57,81
performing a quantum computation
in some sense.


1442
1:9:57,81 --> 1:10:1,42
Or more broadly, whenever a
quantum system evolves forward


1443
1:10:1,42 --> 1:10:4,37
in time, it is in
a sense behaving


1444
1:10:4,37 --> 1:10:5,47
like a quantum computer.


1445
1:10:5,47 --> 1:10:8,78
But I'm afraid that's probably
too broad a notion of what we


1446
1:10:8,78 --> 1:10:10,48
mean by a quantum computer.


1447
1:10:10,48 --> 1:10:12,8
My guess is that nature
has a way of


1448
1:10:12,8 --> 1:10:14,33
realizing quantum computers.


1449
1:10:14,33 --> 1:10:21,1
The way is to allow engineers
to evolve, who build them.


1450
1:10:21,1 --> 1:10:24,22
And that's probably the
way nature does it.


1451
1:10:24,22 --> 1:10:26,64
GREG KROAH-HARTMAN: Maybe we
conclude it here and thank


1452
1:10:26,64 --> 1:10:28,8
John for a beautiful talk.


1453
1:10:28,8 --> 1:10:29,25
JOHN PRESKILL: All right.


1454
1:10:29,25 --> 1:10:30,5
Thanks for listening.


1455
1:10:30,5 --> 1:12:30,5
