0:0:9,6 --> 0:0:31,8
(# Bagpuss theme)


2
0:0:31,8 --> 0:0:32,52
- I'm sorry.
- I'm hit !


3
0:0:32,52 --> 0:0:48,24
- I'm blind.
- Buffy !


4
0:0:48,24 --> 0:0:49,88
- Amber.
- Amber.


5
0:0:49,88 --> 0:0:51,8
- Amber.
- Amber.


6
0:0:51,8 --> 0:1:12,36
Woof.


7
0:1:12,36 --> 0:1:14,6
I knew this day would come.


8
0:1:14,6 --> 0:1:32,4
Still. She had to go sometime.


9
0:1:32,4 --> 0:1:35,72
I met this girl
when I was travelling,


10
0:1:35,72 --> 0:1:38,68
whose dad had to go to war,
but he was crippled.


11
0:1:38,68 --> 0:1:41,12
Because she wasn't
what her parents wanted,


12
0:1:41,12 --> 0:1:43,32
not that Amber
wasn't what you wanted,


13
0:1:43,32 --> 0:1:45,8
but you know she was
different, like a tomboy...


14
0:1:45,8 --> 0:1:49,8
So she stole her dad's armour


15
0:1:49,8 --> 0:1:51,56
and went to war instead of him


16
0:1:51,56 --> 0:1:53,6
and they won the war because of her.


17
0:1:53,6 --> 0:1:56,48
- That's Mulan.
- That's her name. Do you know her ?


18
0:1:56,48 --> 0:1:59,8
- It's a film.
- It's a Disney film. Yes.


19
0:1:59,8 --> 0:2:3,0
And there's a song in it...


20
0:2:3,0 --> 0:2:5,88
which is about how she wants
to look in the mirror...


21
0:2:5,88 --> 0:2:8,44
# And see her real reflection #


22
0:2:8,44 --> 0:2:12,56
I think that's probably
a bit how Amber's feeling.


23
0:2:12,56 --> 0:2:14,76
Like Mulan ?


24
0:2:14,76 --> 0:2:16,0
Yeah.


25
0:2:16,0 --> 0:2:18,8
Eddie Murphy does the voice
of the dragon.


26
0:2:18,8 --> 0:2:20,56
To my mind, his third best film.


27
0:2:20,56 --> 0:2:22,68
Does anyone want a drink ?


28
0:2:22,68 --> 0:2:27,0
Phew. Bit early for that, innit ?
Yeah, go on, then.


29
0:2:27,0 --> 0:2:31,96
I'm thinking more like a tea.


30
0:2:31,96 --> 0:2:33,68
Are you worried about Amber ?


31
0:2:33,68 --> 0:2:40,88
Nah. She's got three languages and a
Dutch cap. She'll be fine. Cheers.


32
0:2:40,88 --> 0:2:44,28
You are so blind !
You so do not understand !


33
0:2:44,28 --> 0:2:46,16
You weren't there at the beginning.


34
0:2:46,16 --> 0:2:48,6
You don't know how good it was.
How important.


35
0:2:48,6 --> 0:2:50,16
This is it for you.


36
0:2:50,16 --> 0:2:52,8
This jumped-up firework
display of a toy advert.


37
0:2:52,8 --> 0:2:55,52
People like you make me sick.
What's wrong with you ?


38
0:2:55,52 --> 0:2:59,72
Now, I don't care if you've
saved up all your 50p's.


39
0:2:59,72 --> 0:3:9,24
Take your pocket money and get out !


40
0:3:9,24 --> 0:3:13,76
What a prick.


41
0:3:13,76 --> 0:3:16,48
Tim, can I have a word in my office ?


42
0:3:16,48 --> 0:3:25,2
Yes.


43
0:3:25,2 --> 0:3:29,92
Have a seat, Tim.


44
0:3:29,92 --> 0:3:32,6
- Twiglet ?
- Better not.


45
0:3:32,6 --> 0:3:34,92
I was like you once.


46
0:3:34,92 --> 0:3:39,96
Blond hair. Scraggy little beard.
Child-like ears.


47
0:3:39,96 --> 0:3:41,88
Full of beans and spunk.


48
0:3:41,88 --> 0:3:44,56
I let my principles
get in the way sometimes.


49
0:3:44,56 --> 0:3:46,36
I punched a bloke
in the face once


50
0:3:46,36 --> 0:3:48,48
for saying Hawk the Slayer
was rubbish.


51
0:3:48,48 --> 0:3:50,32
- Good for you.
- Thanks.


52
0:3:50,32 --> 0:3:51,72
But that's not the point.


53
0:3:51,72 --> 0:3:54,52
The point is, I was defending
the fantasy genre


54
0:3:54,52 --> 0:3:56,28
with terminal intensity,


55
0:3:56,28 --> 0:3:59,24
when what I should have said is,
"Dad, you're right."


56
0:3:59,24 --> 0:4:2,4
Let's give Krull a try
and we'll discuss it later.


57
0:4:2,4 --> 0:4:6,4
The Phantom Menace
was 18 months ago, Tim.


58
0:4:6,4 --> 0:4:9,52
I know, Bilbo.
It just... It still hurts.


59
0:4:9,52 --> 0:4:11,32
That kid brought in a Jaja doll.


60
0:4:11,32 --> 0:4:13,4
- Kids like Jaja.
- Why ?


61
0:4:13,4 --> 0:4:15,36
What about the Ewoks ?


62
0:4:15,36 --> 0:4:17,76
They were rubbish.
You don't complain about them.


63
0:4:17,76 --> 0:4:21,56
Jaja Binks makes the Ewoks
look like fucking Shaft.


64
0:4:21,56 --> 0:4:23,36
- I've had enough, Tim.
- Bilbo.


65
0:4:23,36 --> 0:4:26,12
I know how you feel, I do.
But this can't go on.


66
0:4:26,12 --> 0:4:28,16
What you trying to say ?


67
0:4:28,16 --> 0:4:31,6
I'm gonna have to let you go.


68
0:4:31,6 --> 0:4:36,88
Phew !


69
0:4:36,88 --> 0:4:39,68
I thought you were gonna
fire me then.


70
0:4:39,68 --> 0:4:52,76
I was like ergh... Phew.
Look at that.


71
0:4:52,76 --> 0:4:54,36
Right, Daisy. 0ff to work.


72
0:4:54,36 --> 0:4:56,48
Should be back
in a couple of hours.


73
0:4:56,48 --> 0:4:59,16
Mike. Mike, have you got any money ?


74
0:4:59,16 --> 0:5:1,32
If you mean actual currency, no.


75
0:5:1,32 --> 0:5:5,8
I was sure I had some,
but it just seems to have gone.


76
0:5:5,8 --> 0:5:8,76
Oh, I should, you know, get off.


77
0:5:8,76 --> 0:5:10,92
You didn't sort of borrow it ?


78
0:5:10,92 --> 0:5:13,28
You know, go through
my pockets and...


79
0:5:13,28 --> 0:5:16,96
- Steal it ?
- I'm sorry. That sounded really bad.


80
0:5:16,96 --> 0:5:19,0
- Did you steal it ?
- No !


81
0:5:19,0 --> 0:5:22,52
Sorry. No, you're right.
Have a nice day.


82
0:5:22,52 --> 0:5:24,4
Thanks.


83
0:5:24,4 --> 0:5:26,52
Mike, what do you do ?
I've never asked.


84
0:5:26,52 --> 0:5:29,6
If I tell you that,
I'll have to kill you.


85
0:5:29,6 --> 0:5:31,52
What, is it like secret ?


86
0:5:31,52 --> 0:5:39,4
No.


87
0:5:39,4 --> 0:5:40,36
Hi, Bri.


88
0:5:40,36 --> 0:5:43,64
- Gone.
- What's gone ?


89
0:5:43,64 --> 0:5:47,48
- Can't paint.
- Yes, you can. You're very good.


90
0:5:47,48 --> 0:5:52,72
Mind's just blank. Haven't
painted anything in months.


91
0:5:52,72 --> 0:5:54,48
I don't know what's wrong.


92
0:5:54,48 --> 0:5:58,52
Maybe you should try approaching
the canvas in different ways.


93
0:5:58,52 --> 0:6:13,2
I have.


94
0:6:13,2 --> 0:6:16,68
How do you tackle
a creative block, Daisy ?


95
0:6:16,68 --> 0:6:19,8
Well, I'm actually
very, very fortunate.


96
0:6:19,8 --> 0:6:21,84
I rarely suffer from writer's block.


97
0:6:21,84 --> 0:6:24,16
- I'm extremely prolific.
- Very lucky.


98
0:6:24,16 --> 0:6:26,24
Yeah, I know.


99
0:6:26,24 --> 0:6:28,28
Have you got any money, Brian ?


100
0:6:28,28 --> 0:6:31,56
I've got to sign on today
and I can't afford the bus fare.


101
0:6:31,56 --> 0:6:33,56
Can't you go to the bank ?


102
0:6:33,56 --> 0:6:38,84
Please, just a tenner ?


103
0:6:38,84 --> 0:6:40,4
I haven't got a bank account.


104
0:6:40,4 --> 0:6:43,64
They closed it. I'm really worried.


105
0:6:43,64 --> 0:6:45,56
I haven't signed on for three months


106
0:6:45,56 --> 0:6:47,84
and I didn't tell them
I was going away.


107
0:6:47,84 --> 0:6:52,0
I'm sure you'll be all right.
They're reasonable people.


108
0:6:52,0 --> 0:7:3,32
Please ! Just a tenner.


109
0:7:3,32 --> 0:7:16,52
Tim ?


110
0:7:16,52 --> 0:7:19,28
- Is everything all right ?
- Yes ! Why ? !


111
0:7:19,28 --> 0:7:24,4
No reason.


112
0:7:24,4 --> 0:7:25,24
I've lost my job.


113
0:7:25,24 --> 0:7:33,2
What ? Why ?


114
0:7:33,2 --> 0:7:37,64
Not Phantom Menace.


115
0:7:37,64 --> 0:7:39,92
- Better go.
- All right, Bri.


116
0:7:39,92 --> 0:7:43,44
Good luck with your blockage.
Oh, a letter came for you.


117
0:7:43,44 --> 0:7:47,76
Thanks. Sorry
about your job, Tim.


118
0:7:47,76 --> 0:7:56,16
Yeah. I'm sorry
about your uncle, Brian.


119
0:7:56,16 --> 0:7:59,52
Come on, mate. It's not as if
he hasn't fired you before.


120
0:7:59,52 --> 0:8:1,4
He's a reasonable bloke.


121
0:8:1,4 --> 0:8:3,72
If you talked to him
you could sort it out.


122
0:8:3,72 --> 0:8:7,28
I don't think so. Someone's
got an interview this afternoon.


123
0:8:7,28 --> 0:8:12,32
Well, one thing's for sure,
they'll be no Tim Bisley.


124
0:8:12,32 --> 0:8:17,4
Well, it all seems to be
in order. When can you start ?


125
0:8:17,4 --> 0:8:19,64
Come on, Tim.
There'll be other jobs.


126
0:8:19,64 --> 0:8:22,32
Anyway, what about your comic ?


127
0:8:22,32 --> 0:8:24,8
I'm sure the comic industry's


128
0:8:24,8 --> 0:8:27,16
desperately in need
of a giant, mutant bird


129
0:8:27,16 --> 0:8:32,96
with special claws.


130
0:8:32,96 --> 0:8:35,0
You've just got
to get out there.


131
0:8:35,0 --> 0:8:43,88
- Yeah, well, I'm scared.
- 0f what ?


132
0:8:43,88 --> 0:8:45,8
Nothing.


133
0:8:45,8 --> 0:8:48,2
Come on. I was about
to go and sign on.


134
0:8:48,2 --> 0:8:49,8
Why don't you come with me ?


135
0:8:49,8 --> 0:8:52,48
- OK.
- Lend me the bus fare ?


136
0:8:52,48 --> 0:8:55,64
- OK.
- Yeah.


137
0:8:55,64 --> 0:8:57,6
You've got a very special talent.


138
0:8:57,6 --> 0:9:0,96
Sooner or later it's going
to make you a lot of money.


139
0:9:0,96 --> 0:9:2,8
Yeah, thanks, Daisy.


140
0:9:2,8 --> 0:9:18,96
I wish I had another special
talent to fall back on.


141
0:9:18,96 --> 0:9:22,12
'Dear Brian, I hope
this letter finds you well


142
0:9:22,12 --> 0:9:25,32
'and that you're not finding
being a lawyer too stressful.


143
0:9:25,32 --> 0:9:28,4
'Sadly, I'm writing with bad news.


144
0:9:28,4 --> 0:9:32,0
'Your Uncle Kevin died
in his sleep last weekend


145
0:9:32,0 --> 0:9:35,16
'whilst driving to Staines
on the M4.


146
0:9:35,16 --> 0:9:37,84
'We hope you can find time
in your busy schedule


147
0:9:37,84 --> 0:9:40,8
'to come to the funeral,
which is next Thursday.


148
0:9:40,8 --> 0:9:57,32
'Lots of love, Mum.'


149
0:9:57,32 --> 0:9:59,88
I'm frightened.
What are you gonna say ?


150
0:9:59,88 --> 0:10:2,2
I'll tell 'em I was ill
and start crying.


151
0:10:2,2 --> 0:10:6,24
- That's you. New claims.
- Where ? Oh, yeah. Ok.


152
0:10:6,24 --> 0:10:26,96
- Good luck.
- You, too.


153
0:10:26,96 --> 0:10:28,96
Hello. I'm Daisy Steiner.


154
0:10:28,96 --> 0:10:34,4
I had an appointment
at 10:30. I'm late.


155
0:10:34,4 --> 0:10:36,96
Daisy Steiner, you must take
an AB form from the stand


156
0:10:36,96 --> 0:10:42,64
and then join the queue.


157
0:10:42,64 --> 0:10:44,48
How long will I have to wait ?


158
0:10:44,48 --> 0:10:56,48
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
Just fill out the form.


159
0:10:56,48 --> 0:10:59,44
How long have you been
unemployed, Mr Bisley ?


160
0:10:59,44 --> 0:11:1,2
About an hour and a half.


161
0:11:1,2 --> 0:11:5,48
Have you been looking for work ?


162
0:11:5,48 --> 0:11:8,48
That's good. No.


163
0:11:8,48 --> 0:11:10,4
Why did you leave your last job ?


164
0:11:10,4 --> 0:11:12,8
- I got fired.
- Why ?


165
0:11:12,8 --> 0:11:14,32
Difference of opinion.


166
0:11:14,32 --> 0:11:19,16
- The Phantom Menace.
- Yeah.


167
0:11:19,16 --> 0:11:24,2
- Didn't you like it ?
- No.


168
0:11:24,2 --> 0:11:27,56
Well, leave this with me.


169
0:11:27,56 --> 0:11:41,0
I'll get you some money out
in the next few days.


170
0:11:41,0 --> 0:11:42,4
Hello.


171
0:11:42,4 --> 0:11:44,0
- Brian, it's me.
- Hello, me.


172
0:11:44,0 --> 0:11:46,52
- How are you ?
- Very well, thank you.


173
0:11:46,52 --> 0:11:51,28
- I miss you.
- Miss me, too.


174
0:11:51,28 --> 0:11:54,4
Would you like to come out
for drinks later ?


175
0:11:54,4 --> 0:11:57,72
- Yes, please.
- 'I could stay at yours.'


176
0:11:57,72 --> 0:12:2,4
I'm not working tomorrow.
We could stay in bed all day.


177
0:12:2,4 --> 0:12:5,52
So don't forget
to wash your sheets.


178
0:12:5,52 --> 0:12:8,52
- Right.
- And your penis.


179
0:12:8,52 --> 0:12:12,72
- OK.
- 'Bye.'


180
0:12:12,72 --> 0:12:28,4
Bye.


181
0:12:28,4 --> 0:12:34,16
Ah, no. This is the Ab form.
You need the AB form, capital B.


182
0:12:34,16 --> 0:12:35,68
But... What ?


183
0:12:35,68 --> 0:12:37,64
I've been here for over an hour.


184
0:12:37,64 --> 0:12:43,32
Just over there on the stand.


185
0:12:43,32 --> 0:12:48,0
Is this it ?


186
0:12:48,0 --> 0:12:49,8
Ok. You wanna sign on again.


187
0:12:49,8 --> 0:12:50,92
Yeah.


188
0:12:50,92 --> 0:12:52,96
You last signed on three months ago.


189
0:12:52,96 --> 0:12:55,0
What have you been doing since then ?


190
0:12:55,0 --> 0:13:0,92
I've been ill.


191
0:13:0,92 --> 0:13:3,68
Do you have a doctor's note ?


192
0:13:3,68 --> 0:13:5,84
No, I lost it.


193
0:13:5,84 --> 0:13:8,6
Look, this shouldn't be a problem.


194
0:13:8,6 --> 0:13:11,44
I just want some money.


195
0:13:11,44 --> 0:13:13,68
You've always
given me money before.


196
0:13:13,68 --> 0:13:15,72
Sure you haven't been on holiday ?


197
0:13:15,72 --> 0:13:28,64
Me ? God, no. I couldn't
afford that. Not on my income.


198
0:13:28,64 --> 0:13:32,44
- You... bastard !
- What can I say ? She liked me.


199
0:13:32,44 --> 0:13:35,12
How am I gonna pay the rent ?


200
0:13:35,12 --> 0:13:36,92
Just write some articles.


201
0:13:36,92 --> 0:13:39,88
It's not as easy as that, Tim.
I can't just pluck


202
0:13:39,88 --> 0:13:43,16
another Winter Skin Care
Dos And Don'ts out of the air.


203
0:13:43,16 --> 0:13:47,96
Why ?


204
0:13:47,96 --> 0:13:51,92
Well, maybe poverty
will inspire you.


205
0:13:51,92 --> 0:13:53,52
It's not that bad.


206
0:13:53,52 --> 0:13:55,56
Mike's giving us
a few quid every week.


207
0:13:55,56 --> 0:13:57,68
What if he wants to move out ?


208
0:13:57,68 --> 0:14:0,16
He doesn't at the moment.
He's happy.


209
0:14:0,16 --> 0:14:2,68
It's not as if he's gonna
get a better offer


210
0:14:2,68 --> 0:14:4,84
by the time we get back, is it ?


211
0:14:4,84 --> 0:14:18,32
Eh ?


212
0:14:18,32 --> 0:14:19,4
Mike, d'you mind...


213
0:14:19,4 --> 0:14:20,84
What are you doing ?


214
0:14:20,84 --> 0:14:25,32
Marsha has kindly offered me
the position of lodger,


215
0:14:25,32 --> 0:14:27,2
which I have duly accepted.


216
0:14:27,2 --> 0:14:28,72
- But Mike...
- No, no.


217
0:14:28,72 --> 0:14:30,8
You've been kind enough
to let me stay,


218
0:14:30,8 --> 0:14:33,12
but now you're back,
I should move on.


219
0:14:33,12 --> 0:14:35,0
But we like having you here.


220
0:14:35,0 --> 0:14:36,8
It'll be fine. I'm only upstairs.


221
0:14:36,8 --> 0:14:38,64
We can see each other every day.


222
0:14:38,64 --> 0:14:41,52
We'll be able to legitimately
use our walkie-talkies


223
0:14:41,52 --> 0:14:42,92
without going to the park.


224
0:14:42,92 --> 0:14:46,44
- Ready then ?
- With you in one second.


225
0:14:46,44 --> 0:14:49,8
Here he is, then. My new lodger.


226
0:14:49,8 --> 0:14:51,24
Hardly see the other one.


227
0:14:51,24 --> 0:14:54,92
Yeah, Brian's spending
a lot of time with Twist.


228
0:14:54,92 --> 0:14:57,12
I mean, I hardly see her.


229
0:14:57,12 --> 0:15:4,32
I sometimes hear her.


230
0:15:4,32 --> 0:15:6,32
Yeah, he was up earlier on.


231
0:15:6,32 --> 0:15:9,8
I think he's having some kind
of creative crisis.


232
0:15:9,8 --> 0:15:12,72
Serves him right for getting
his knackers in a twist.


233
0:15:12,72 --> 0:15:14,36
Come on then, Mike.


234
0:15:14,36 --> 0:15:17,84
I'm looking forward to having a
strong bloke round the house.


235
0:15:17,84 --> 0:15:19,8
Who's that ?


236
0:15:19,8 --> 0:15:22,44
- You, you pillock.
- Oh, right.


237
0:15:22,44 --> 0:15:33,6
Oooooooh, he's funny, isn't he ?


238
0:15:33,6 --> 0:15:35,12
Any thoughts ?


239
0:15:35,12 --> 0:15:38,24
I'll have to get some new
batteries for my walkie-talkie.


240
0:15:38,24 --> 0:15:39,92
No, about our situation.


241
0:15:39,92 --> 0:15:41,48
We're both unemployed.


242
0:15:41,48 --> 0:15:43,96
I'm getting no benefit.
We need money.


243
0:15:43,96 --> 0:15:46,76
How else am I gonna afford
aspirational magazines ?


244
0:15:46,76 --> 0:15:48,4
I'm gonna get a job.


245
0:15:48,4 --> 0:15:51,24
Why ? You've just signed on.
You don't have to.


246
0:15:51,24 --> 0:15:53,32
I like working, Daisy.


247
0:15:53,32 --> 0:15:55,88
The smell of the ink,
the taste of the biscuit.


248
0:15:55,88 --> 0:15:57,68
Giving the littl'uns advice.


249
0:15:57,68 --> 0:16:1,4
'People like you
make me sick ! '


250
0:16:1,4 --> 0:16:3,72
Yeah, well. So do I.
I love working.


251
0:16:3,72 --> 0:16:6,92
I was a barmaid once. I loved it.


252
0:16:6,92 --> 0:16:9,16
The hustle and bustle of a busy bar.


253
0:16:9,16 --> 0:16:12,6
- Can I get some service, please ?
- Oh, fuck you.


254
0:16:12,6 --> 0:16:15,88
What can I say ?
We are good with people.


255
0:16:15,88 --> 0:16:17,96
- Absolutely.
- That's what writers do.


256
0:16:17,96 --> 0:16:21,64
They take unrelated jobs
in order to make money


257
0:16:21,64 --> 0:16:23,8
and... gain experience.


258
0:16:23,8 --> 0:16:26,92
I temped in this office once


259
0:16:26,92 --> 0:16:30,32
and there were some great
characters, real fodder.


260
0:16:30,32 --> 0:16:35,88
There was this guy Tony...


261
0:16:35,88 --> 0:16:40,76
Oh, what did he say ?


262
0:16:40,76 --> 0:16:43,6
Anyway, that's what I'm gonna do.


263
0:16:43,6 --> 0:16:47,12
Everyone does things they don't
want to do sometimes.


264
0:16:47,12 --> 0:16:48,8
Mike isn't doing what he wants


265
0:16:48,8 --> 0:16:50,88
- but he makes the best of it.
- Does he ?


266
0:16:50,88 --> 0:16:53,56
Move, move !


267
0:16:53,56 --> 0:16:55,44
Don't look at me ! Move !


268
0:16:55,44 --> 0:16:58,28
I am gonna go to one
of those temping places


269
0:16:58,28 --> 0:17:0,48
and put my name down for a job.


270
0:17:0,48 --> 0:17:2,4
That's the spirit. New horizons.


271
0:17:2,4 --> 0:17:7,4
- Pastures green. Change.
- And not the small kind.


272
0:17:7,4 --> 0:17:11,0
- Why is that funny ?
- I don't know.


273
0:17:11,0 --> 0:17:13,4
You worked
in a comic shop before ?


274
0:17:13,4 --> 0:17:15,56
Yeah. The Fantasy Bazaar.


275
0:17:15,56 --> 0:17:19,8
Fantasy Bazaar. That's
Bilbo Bagshot's shop, isn't it ?


276
0:17:19,8 --> 0:17:21,96
- Yeah.
- Why'd you leave ?


277
0:17:21,96 --> 0:17:26,4
- Difference of opinion.
- Phantom Menace ?


278
0:17:26,4 --> 0:17:29,8
Yeah. And I wanted a change.


279
0:17:29,8 --> 0:17:34,36
- Ok. When can you start ?
- I'm sorry ?


280
0:17:34,36 --> 0:17:39,88
When can you start ?


281
0:17:39,88 --> 0:17:43,0
So, what kind
of work can you do ?


282
0:17:43,0 --> 0:17:45,24
Sorry ?


283
0:17:45,24 --> 0:17:48,44
What kind of work can you do ?


284
0:17:48,44 --> 0:17:51,24
Well, I'm creative,


285
0:17:51,24 --> 0:17:56,28
but I'm at home in the normal
office environment.


286
0:17:56,28 --> 0:18:0,36
But equally comfortable in the
hustle and bustle of an eatery.


287
0:18:0,36 --> 0:18:1,96
So that's anything ?


288
0:18:1,96 --> 0:18:19,96
Yes, yes. Anything. I'm desperate.


289
0:18:19,96 --> 0:18:24,12
- Everything all right ?
- Yes, thank you, Mrs K.


290
0:18:24,12 --> 0:18:26,4
Give us a shout
if you need anything.


291
0:18:26,4 --> 0:18:27,64
OK.


292
0:18:27,64 --> 0:18:29,4
Anything at all.


293
0:18:29,4 --> 0:18:31,4
Ok, then.


294
0:18:31,4 --> 0:18:35,32
I like to think I'm
an approachable landlady.


295
0:18:35,32 --> 0:18:39,64
Ok, then.


296
0:18:39,64 --> 0:18:42,68
- That's great.
- So anything you want.


297
0:18:42,68 --> 0:18:45,64
Just ask.


298
0:18:45,64 --> 0:18:50,72
There a key to this lock ?


299
0:18:50,72 --> 0:18:52,4
Hello, Brian.


300
0:18:52,4 --> 0:18:55,72
Hello.


301
0:18:55,72 --> 0:18:58,8
Aren't you gonna invite me in ?


302
0:18:58,8 --> 0:19:5,16
- Bit busy.
- Doing what ?


303
0:19:5,16 --> 0:19:10,8
Nice to see you've tidied up a bit.


304
0:19:10,8 --> 0:19:12,4
Thanks.


305
0:19:12,4 --> 0:19:16,0
Daisy was telling me
you're feeling a little dry.


306
0:19:16,0 --> 0:19:17,6
Everything Ok ?


307
0:19:17,6 --> 0:19:22,16
- Mmm.
- Yes ?


308
0:19:22,16 --> 0:19:26,0
Don't know, Marsha.
Can't seem to get inspired.


309
0:19:26,0 --> 0:19:27,32
Used to come so easily.


310
0:19:27,32 --> 0:19:29,44
Thought I'd cracked it this morning.


311
0:19:29,44 --> 0:19:31,96
Got a letter saying
Uncle Kevin had died.


312
0:19:31,96 --> 0:19:35,16
Next thing I knew, I was painting.
Couldn't stop.


313
0:19:35,16 --> 0:19:39,24
Twist called and lost it. Just went.


314
0:19:39,24 --> 0:19:42,12
You know what
your problem is, Brian.


315
0:19:42,12 --> 0:19:44,6
What ?


316
0:19:44,6 --> 0:19:47,6
You're happy.


317
0:19:47,6 --> 0:19:49,28
I think you'll find


318
0:19:49,28 --> 0:19:53,24
you dried up the minute
you started seeing Twit.


319
0:19:53,24 --> 0:19:57,84
- D'you think so ?
- It's obvious.


320
0:19:57,84 --> 0:20:1,68
You cannot have your cake
and eat her, Brian.


321
0:20:1,68 --> 0:20:6,16
Contentment is the enemy
of invention.


322
0:20:6,16 --> 0:20:7,64
Oh, my God.


323
0:20:7,64 --> 0:20:10,72
Funny, innit ?


324
0:20:10,72 --> 0:20:15,4
You were so prolific
when we was at it.


325
0:20:15,4 --> 0:20:18,48
- This is awful.
- Innit.


326
0:20:18,48 --> 0:20:21,52
- What a dilemma.
- Can't believe this.


327
0:20:21,52 --> 0:20:25,8
It's so depressing, Brian.


328
0:20:25,8 --> 0:20:28,16
You must be really worried.


329
0:20:28,16 --> 0:20:31,4
- Yes.
- Angst-ridden.


330
0:20:31,4 --> 0:20:36,16
- Yes.
- Inconsolable.


331
0:20:36,16 --> 0:20:39,92
Yes.


332
0:20:39,92 --> 0:20:42,8
Right, I'm off.


333
0:20:42,8 --> 0:20:44,4
Mike's cooking beans,


334
0:20:44,4 --> 0:20:58,84
then we're gonna polish his guns
and watch The A-Team, bye.


335
0:20:58,84 --> 0:21:13,6
I love it when a plan comes together.


336
0:21:13,6 --> 0:21:15,88
Hello, Silent Reading.


337
0:21:15,88 --> 0:21:18,52
Yes, we do stock Jaja Binks
merchandise.


338
0:21:18,52 --> 0:21:20,88
Yeah, we've got him in
cuddly form,


339
0:21:20,88 --> 0:21:23,12
lunch box, action figure
and key ring.


340
0:21:23,12 --> 0:21:27,2
No problem, bye-bye.


341
0:21:27,2 --> 0:21:28,72
Well done, Tim.


342
0:21:28,72 --> 0:21:32,16
You've just taken your first
step into a larger world.


343
0:21:32,16 --> 0:21:36,8
All right, Derek.


344
0:21:36,8 --> 0:21:37,52
Bilbo.


345
0:21:37,52 --> 0:21:40,32
I was wondering if I could
have a chat with Tim.


346
0:21:40,32 --> 0:21:43,24
Certainly.


347
0:21:43,24 --> 0:21:44,64
I'll put some tea on.


348
0:21:44,64 --> 0:21:52,0
- Want a cup, Tim ?
- Yes, please.


349
0:21:52,0 --> 0:21:54,32
He should mount
his collector's editions


350
0:21:54,32 --> 0:21:56,96
in full view, not hide 'em away.


351
0:21:56,96 --> 0:21:58,48
Man's insane.


352
0:21:58,48 --> 0:22:0,36
Why'd you want to talk to me ?


353
0:22:0,36 --> 0:22:2,92
So, how's it going ?


354
0:22:2,92 --> 0:22:4,28
Yeah, it's all right.


355
0:22:4,28 --> 0:22:8,96
- What's Derek like as a boss ?
- He's Ok.


356
0:22:8,96 --> 0:22:14,28
I don't really agree with his
policy on vintage comic display.


357
0:22:14,28 --> 0:22:16,88
Tim, I'm sorry I sacked you.
It was a mistake.


358
0:22:16,88 --> 0:22:19,36
Things not working out
with the new guy ?


359
0:22:19,36 --> 0:22:21,48
You could say that.


360
0:22:21,48 --> 0:22:25,28
Hawk the Slayer's rubbish.


361
0:22:25,28 --> 0:22:27,84
- I see.
- Will you come back ?


362
0:22:27,84 --> 0:22:29,2
Well... I like it here.


363
0:22:29,2 --> 0:22:31,64
What makes you think
I want to come back ?


364
0:22:31,64 --> 0:22:35,0
This.


365
0:22:35,0 --> 0:22:37,4
'Bilbo, this is Tim.


366
0:22:37,4 --> 0:22:42,52
'Please can I come back ?
I don't like it here.'


367
0:22:42,52 --> 0:22:45,28
- You got that ?
- I would have come in anyway.


368
0:22:45,28 --> 0:22:50,12
The place is just not
the same without you.


369
0:22:50,12 --> 0:22:51,52
I'm already there.


370
0:22:51,52 --> 0:22:53,24
What ?


371
0:22:53,24 --> 0:22:55,12
I mean, I'll come back.


372
0:22:55,12 --> 0:22:59,68
Oh, yeah. Yeah, you frightened
me for a bit there.


373
0:22:59,68 --> 0:23:1,68
I'll have to give my notice here.


374
0:23:1,68 --> 0:23:6,0
Can't you just get fired ?


375
0:23:6,0 --> 0:23:9,96
Derek, Babylon 5's
a big pile of shit.


376
0:23:9,96 --> 0:23:26,32
Get out !


377
0:23:26,32 --> 0:23:29,4
I got me job back.


378
0:23:29,4 --> 0:23:32,36
I got me own room.


379
0:23:32,36 --> 0:23:33,52
How's Brian doing ?


380
0:23:33,52 --> 0:23:37,56
He's standing in the garden
with no clothes on.


381
0:23:37,56 --> 0:23:40,68
- What about Daisy ?
- She got a job in a bookshop.


382
0:23:40,68 --> 0:24:2,48
- Think she'll be all right ?
- Erm... Yeah.


383
0:24:2,48 --> 0:24:7,4
Excuse me, can you point me
in the direction of Personal Growth ?


384
0:24:7,4 --> 0:24:17,48
Fuck you.


385
0:24:17,48 --> 0:26:17,48
'S'il vous plaоt.'
