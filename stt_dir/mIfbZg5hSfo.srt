(Mobile)


3
0:0:35,24 --> 0:0:38,44
Bugger. Bugger.


4
0:0:38,44 --> 0:0:41,64
Yep, yep. I'm coming, I'm coming.


5
0:0:41,64 --> 0:0:43,64
I'm coming, all right?


6
0:0:43,64 --> 0:0:45,92
Pain in the arse!


7
0:0:45,92 --> 0:0:48,96
- Where are you off to?
- I'm going to yoga.


8
0:0:48,96 --> 0:0:50,56
Oh, I've often wondered...


9
0:0:50,56 --> 0:0:53,0
- What?
- Don't start.


10
0:0:53,0 --> 0:0:57,16
- Eva says I'm stressed.
- What does Eva know about stress?


11
0:0:57,16 --> 0:0:59,72
- She has three kids.
- We've all got three kids.


12
0:0:59,72 --> 0:1:4,8
- At least she's doing something.
- Oi, Thor, get on with it.


13
0:1:4,8 --> 0:1:6,28
I'm only doing it once to shut her up.


14
0:1:6,28 --> 0:1:8,92
I've got to go, I'm late. I'm always late.


15
0:1:8,92 --> 0:1:16,44
Fags.


16
0:1:16,44 --> 0:1:20,6
W-Why have you moved everything
on my desk? Where's my lighter?


17
0:1:20,6 --> 0:1:23,4
Bills. Lots of bills.


18
0:1:23,4 --> 0:1:27,92
Our solicitor sent her solicitor a letter
and his solicitor is billing us for it.


19
0:1:27,92 --> 0:1:31,72
- Are you making coffee or not?
- We need some decent stock.


20
0:1:31,72 --> 0:1:34,76
Stop, Mother of God,
go and get your hair done!


21
0:1:34,76 --> 0:1:37,48
The boiler sounds like it's giving birth,


22
0:1:37,48 --> 0:1:41,24
you still haven't taken
your encyclopedias out of the bath.


23
0:1:41,24 --> 0:1:43,12
I want a herb garden.


24
0:1:43,12 --> 0:1:46,16
What's the matter with you?
Where's my lighter?


25
0:1:46,16 --> 0:1:50,12
Fran is coming to dinner,
I have to cook, clean, run the shop,


26
0:1:50,12 --> 0:1:53,8
- do the dusting, tidy...
- Excuse me.


27
0:1:53,8 --> 0:1:55,32
- Just tell me where it is.
- Excuse me?


28
0:1:55,32 --> 0:1:57,92
- What? What?
- Do you have any Adam Phillips?


29
0:1:57,92 --> 0:2:0,48
How would I know?
Go to a proper book shop.


30
0:2:0,48 --> 0:2:4,44
Look, I didn't come in here
to be insulted.


31
0:2:4,44 --> 0:2:8,4
Well, I didn't ask for the job
of insulting you.


32
0:2:8,4 --> 0:2:11,76
You know, in another life,
maybe we could have been brothers,


33
0:2:11,76 --> 0:2:14,6
running a small, quirky taverna in Sicily.


34
0:2:14,6 --> 0:2:17,24
Maybe we would have
married the local twins


35
0:2:17,24 --> 0:2:20,56
instead of wasting
each other's time in this dump.


36
0:2:20,56 --> 0:2:24,56
But it was not to be, so...


37
0:2:24,56 --> 0:2:27,4
hop it.


38
0:2:27,4 --> 0:2:28,6
Manny, I'm being calm,


39
0:2:28,6 --> 0:2:31,4
I am asking you
for the last time, where is my...


40
0:2:31,4 --> 0:2:34,44
Who does all the shopping? Me.
All the cooking? Me.


41
0:2:34,44 --> 0:2:36,4
Who gets all the stock? Me.


42
0:2:36,4 --> 0:2:38,8
Who went without
so you had a hot breakfast? Me.


43
0:2:38,8 --> 0:2:42,28
Look, there is your lighter there,
next to your cigarettes.


44
0:2:42,28 --> 0:2:49,6
On the desk which I tidied earlier.
Enjoy your bacon roll.


45
0:2:49,6 --> 0:2:52,48
Why do you always have
to make the bacon so curly?


46
0:2:52,48 --> 0:2:55,4
Right! That's it, I quit.


47
0:2:55,4 --> 0:2:59,8
You quit every day.
I'm going out now for some peace.


48
0:2:59,8 --> 0:3:3,12
I suggest when you reapply for the job
in about half an hour


49
0:3:3,12 --> 0:3:5,44
you do the interview yourself.


50
0:3:5,44 --> 0:3:9,8
Why not wear your pinstripe suit,
the one that gives you a big arse?


51
0:3:9,8 --> 0:3:17,16
You like the look of yourself in that.


52
0:3:17,16 --> 0:3:18,84
Every bloody day...


53
0:3:18,84 --> 0:3:21,44
- (Door opens)
- I don't know why I bother.


54
0:3:21,44 --> 0:3:23,68
(Sighs deeply)


55
0:3:23,68 --> 0:3:26,72
You interested in these?


56
0:3:26,72 --> 0:3:28,24
Freud?


57
0:3:28,24 --> 0:3:31,0
- Complete set?
- Yeah. Load of rubbish, really.


58
0:3:31,0 --> 0:3:33,72
Don't try and push me.


59
0:3:33,72 --> 0:3:35,28
Condition OK.


60
0:3:35,28 --> 0:3:37,32
Bit scuffed.


61
0:3:37,32 --> 0:3:38,8
20 quid.


62
0:3:38,8 --> 0:3:41,6
- That's fine...
- All right, 25. That's it.


63
0:3:41,6 --> 0:3:44,96
- Great, they're all yours...
- 30. 35.


64
0:3:44,96 --> 0:3:47,96
All right, 40 is my final offer.


65
0:3:47,96 --> 0:3:50,6
50 quid. That's all they're worth.


66
0:3:50,6 --> 0:3:56,16
- All right! 60, yeah?
- Great.


67
0:3:56,16 --> 0:3:58,28
Here's the money. And, er...


68
0:3:58,28 --> 0:4:3,4
here's a tenner for the taxi.


69
0:4:3,4 --> 0:4:11,8
That looks good.


70
0:4:11,8 --> 0:4:13,4
- Hey, hey!
- What?


71
0:4:13,4 --> 0:4:17,0
Brown sauce?


72
0:4:17,0 --> 0:4:23,8
(Birdsong)


73
0:4:23,8 --> 0:4:26,36
- Told you so.
- It's amazing.


74
0:4:26,36 --> 0:4:28,92
If I was any more relaxed
you could just...


75
0:4:28,92 --> 0:4:36,36
- (Mobile)
...pour me into a bowl.


76
0:4:36,36 --> 0:4:38,48
Look at you smiling away.


77
0:4:38,48 --> 0:4:40,84
- (Giggles)
- See?


78
0:4:40,84 --> 0:4:46,12
You don't need horrible cigarettes
and gallons of booze just to feel normal.


79
0:4:46,12 --> 0:4:48,64
- Is this normal?
- Yes!


80
0:4:48,64 --> 0:4:50,84
That's what I'm telling you.


81
0:4:50,84 --> 0:4:53,48
You change when you drink,
you're so loud.


82
0:4:53,48 --> 0:4:57,16
You sit there with a fag,
cackling like something out of a brothel.


83
0:4:57,16 --> 0:4:59,8
God, I don't. How horrible.


84
0:4:59,8 --> 0:5:4,4
And when you're drunk,
the way you eat and swear...


85
0:5:4,4 --> 0:5:8,16
Suddenly crying and then singing
and kissing terrible men.


86
0:5:8,16 --> 0:5:10,88
I know, I know, I'm awful.


87
0:5:10,88 --> 0:5:13,88
I worry you'll end up
with a head full of gold teeth


88
0:5:13,88 --> 0:5:16,4
roaring over a vegetable stall someplace.


89
0:5:16,4 --> 0:5:20,6
- I'm not that...
- Come over for the next set of exercises.


90
0:5:20,6 --> 0:5:25,8
- We can have carrot juice.
- Carrot juice!


91
0:5:25,8 --> 0:5:27,8
What? No, yes, I'd love to.


92
0:5:27,8 --> 0:5:32,48
- Definitely, great.
- I'll see you then.


93
0:5:32,48 --> 0:5:38,2
You know, I've never told you but
all those fags and booze make you reek.


94
0:5:38,2 --> 0:5:41,4
- What? D-Do I?
- Stinky-poos.


95
0:5:41,4 --> 0:5:44,48
No more smoking and drinking
with those two layabouts.


96
0:5:44,48 --> 0:5:59,8
No, no-no, I won't.


97
0:5:59,8 --> 0:6:5,0
Excuse me, can I get...?


98
0:6:5,0 --> 0:6:9,72
Where were you? I called you for ages.
Manny is driving me nuts.


99
0:6:9,72 --> 0:6:13,44
That's because he's got pressure
on his meridian lines.


100
0:6:13,44 --> 0:6:16,76
Which...? Excuse me, c-could I...?


101
0:6:16,76 --> 0:6:18,72
Do I smell or what?


102
0:6:18,72 --> 0:6:22,6
(Sniffs) Yes, because you're full of things
that are bad for you.


103
0:6:22,6 --> 0:6:25,28
What? Listen, he's making me miserable.


104
0:6:25,28 --> 0:6:30,12
You are miserable because you are
always guzzling, gulping or puffing.


105
0:6:30,12 --> 0:6:33,16
What's wrong with you?
I'm talking about Manny.


106
0:6:33,16 --> 0:6:36,24
You know, the fruit storm
I happen to live with.


107
0:6:36,24 --> 0:6:39,32
- I want a drink.
- You always want something.


108
0:6:39,32 --> 0:6:42,52
In Tibet, if they want something,
know what they do?


109
0:6:42,52 --> 0:6:45,28
- They give something away.
- Do they? Do they?


110
0:6:45,28 --> 0:6:48,56
That must be why
they're such a dominant global power.


111
0:6:48,56 --> 0:6:50,12
Excuse me!


112
0:6:50,12 --> 0:6:54,76
You should stop smoking and drinking.
I haven't had anything for two hours.


113
0:6:54,76 --> 0:6:56,68
- Why not?
- Yoga.


114
0:6:56,68 --> 0:7:0,76
Don't mess around with that stuff.
I read it's very dangerous.


115
0:7:0,76 --> 0:7:4,68
It's amazing.
It's like having sunshine in your veins.


116
0:7:4,68 --> 0:7:6,12
Here we go, Mary Poppins.


117
0:7:6,12 --> 0:7:9,36
It is a shame the way
people pollute themselves.


118
0:7:9,36 --> 0:7:13,8
I mean, look around you.
Just look, what do you see?


119
0:7:13,8 --> 0:7:15,24
I see intelligent, attractive people


120
0:7:15,24 --> 0:7:18,84
who smoke and drink all the time
and never get sick or die.


121
0:7:18,84 --> 0:7:21,32
Or bore the bollocks off their friends.


122
0:7:21,32 --> 0:7:24,44
Excuse...!


123
0:7:24,44 --> 0:7:29,36
This is pointless. I'll see you at dinner,
which he is making a big deal out of.


124
0:7:29,36 --> 0:7:33,8
You are being irrational.
The only way to inner peace...


125
0:7:33,8 --> 0:7:35,32
Stop talking goo.


126
0:7:35,32 --> 0:7:45,48
The only thing that will bring me
inner peace is a beard-seeking missile.


127
0:7:45,48 --> 0:7:48,72
(# Manny humming)


128
0:7:48,72 --> 0:7:52,2
(Footsteps on stairs)


129
0:7:52,2 --> 0:7:56,52
Are you trying to kill me?
You left a box of books on the stairs.


130
0:7:56,52 --> 0:7:59,52
Sorry I bought something
that will actually sell.


131
0:7:59,52 --> 0:8:2,16
- What? What is it?
- Freud, complete works.


132
0:8:2,16 --> 0:8:7,68
Drivel. A waste of money.


133
0:8:7,68 --> 0:8:12,12
So what kind of filth is spewing out
of your hatch tonight?


134
0:8:12,12 --> 0:8:14,68
Mini medleys of chicken
with summer berries.


135
0:8:14,68 --> 0:8:17,24
You know I hate student food.


136
0:8:17,24 --> 0:8:20,24
To start, and then
daube of Argentinian lamb


137
0:8:20,24 --> 0:8:25,48
with a julienne of red roots,
celeriac mash and salsa verde.


138
0:8:25,48 --> 0:8:27,44
I bet you forgot to buy the plonk.


139
0:8:27,44 --> 0:8:32,32
The wines will be a Tavel,
followed by Primitiva or Navarra.


140
0:8:32,32 --> 0:8:35,4
Well, I want a drink now!


141
0:8:35,4 --> 0:8:38,92
There's the two litres
of your Spanish antifreeze.


142
0:8:38,92 --> 0:8:43,8
Let me know when
you want your food chewed.


143
0:8:43,8 --> 0:8:48,92
- I'll wait till you put your teeth in, dear.
- Don't start...


144
0:8:48,92 --> 0:8:57,36
Oh, isn't this nice?


145
0:8:57,36 --> 0:8:59,72
What were those funny-coloured things?


146
0:8:59,72 --> 0:9:1,48
Vegetables.


147
0:9:1,48 --> 0:9:5,48
You know I'm allergic to vegetables.
You are trying to kill me.


148
0:9:5,48 --> 0:9:9,52
Excuse me.


149
0:9:9,52 --> 0:9:12,6
- (Slams plates down)
- What's the matter with him?


150
0:9:12,6 --> 0:9:14,84
His energy centres are misaligned.


151
0:9:14,84 --> 0:9:18,96
- Oh, Christ!
- And you're feeling like this because...


152
0:9:18,96 --> 0:9:22,6
I feel like this because he never thinks
of anyone but himself.


153
0:9:22,6 --> 0:9:26,76
- Fran, I've made something for you.
- Oh, Manny.


154
0:9:26,76 --> 0:9:30,56
It's your favourite - rum and chocolate.


155
0:9:30,56 --> 0:9:33,76
- Oh...
- Oh, yes, kissy-kissy. Ugh.


156
0:9:33,76 --> 0:9:35,24
I can't really have any.


157
0:9:35,24 --> 0:9:38,36
- I'm avoiding all stimulants.
- Oh, listen to you!


158
0:9:38,36 --> 0:9:41,68
You're becoming one of them,
going to the other side.


159
0:9:41,68 --> 0:9:45,52
The land of sandals, spoon-benders
and yogurt-fanciers.


160
0:9:45,52 --> 0:9:49,12
Everybody farts a lot
because they don't know how to laugh.


161
0:9:49,12 --> 0:9:51,6
Everyone should meditate.


162
0:9:51,6 --> 0:9:54,36
Oh, let's, then we can all make some tofu


163
0:9:54,36 --> 0:9:57,12
for the dolphins who live in the fridge.


164
0:9:57,12 --> 0:10:0,4
Fran is trying to improve her life,
you could support her.


165
0:10:0,4 --> 0:10:5,0
It's shite. Like the Freud.
How did you price that rubbish?


166
0:10:5,0 --> 0:10:7,8
I didn't. I was... (Kicks table)... cooking!


167
0:10:7,8 --> 0:10:15,12
How very convenient to leave
all the back-breaking labour to me.


168
0:10:15,12 --> 0:10:18,0
Yoga. Freud. (Scoffs)


169
0:10:18,0 --> 0:10:19,8
Fran, I need to talk to you.


170
0:10:19,8 --> 0:10:22,48
He treats me like a child. I can't cope.


171
0:10:22,48 --> 0:10:25,72
He eats all the sweets,
he says they'll make my hair fall out.


172
0:10:25,72 --> 0:10:28,4
I found a baby monitor under my bed.


173
0:10:28,4 --> 0:10:31,28
- We'll sort it out right now.
- What will we do?


174
0:10:31,28 --> 0:10:33,8
- Close your eyes.
- God, Fran...


175
0:10:33,8 --> 0:10:36,84
(Fran) And keep them closed.
Take a deep breath.


176
0:10:36,84 --> 0:10:39,76
Stick out your tongue and roll your head.


177
0:10:39,76 --> 0:10:41,6
Ahhh-uhhh.


178
0:10:41,6 --> 0:10:49,68
Bluhhh...


179
0:10:49,68 --> 0:10:52,56
"The psychopathology
of the inverted sociopath."


180
0:10:52,56 --> 0:10:54,72
(Continues droning)


181
0:10:54,72 --> 0:11:1,6
This is all about him.


182
0:11:1,6 --> 0:11:4,44
Mania.


183
0:11:4,44 --> 0:11:7,96
And relax. Now fold your arms.


184
0:11:7,96 --> 0:11:11,8
And sway them gently.


185
0:11:11,8 --> 0:11:14,4
That's it.


186
0:11:14,4 --> 0:11:16,64
Mother complex.


187
0:11:16,64 --> 0:11:20,2
He's got the lot!


188
0:11:20,2 --> 0:11:22,16
OK, and raise your head...


189
0:11:22,16 --> 0:11:30,28
and open your eyes.


190
0:11:30,28 --> 0:11:34,56
- Now, doesn't that feel better?
- Yes.


191
0:11:34,56 --> 0:11:38,8
But he's becoming impossible.
Look, he hasn't left anything for us.


192
0:11:38,8 --> 0:11:42,48
(Belches)


193
0:11:42,48 --> 0:11:45,84
(# Whistling merrily)


194
0:11:45,84 --> 0:11:47,88
- Breakfast!
- What?


195
0:11:47,88 --> 0:11:50,92
Ow! (Groaning)

0:12:0,52 --> 0:12:2,84
- Ow!
- Nasal spray?


200
0:12:2,84 --> 0:12:7,4
Fungicide.


201
0:12:7,4 --> 0:12:12,24
What's this?


202
0:12:12,24 --> 0:12:14,68
Why did you do that?


203
0:12:14,68 --> 0:12:17,48
- So you could use the towel.
- Oh, you're insane.


204
0:12:17,48 --> 0:12:31,12
Get out.


205
0:12:31,12 --> 0:12:36,12

206
0:12:36,12 --> 0:12:40,52
According to Freud it's dangerous
even to be in the same room as you.


207
0:12:40,52 --> 0:12:44,0
We'll have to replace
all our cutlery with plastic.


208
0:12:44,0 --> 0:12:46,88
And then I want to get you
electronically tagged.


209
0:12:46,88 --> 0:12:49,72
Bernard, pass the butter, please.


210
0:12:49,72 --> 0:12:51,32
- This?
- No, that.


211
0:12:51,32 --> 0:12:53,84
- What did you say?
- I said, "No, that."


212
0:12:53,84 --> 0:12:57,8
You said, "No, Dad."


213
0:12:57,8 --> 0:13:0,0
There you go again, projecting.


214
0:13:0,0 --> 0:13:3,76
I wish I'd never bought the stupid books.
I'm not projecting.


215
0:13:3,76 --> 0:13:5,76
I've never seen such projecting.

0:13:9,28 --> 0:13:11,72
You're deranged. You need help.

0:13:11,72 --> 0:13:13,48
- I'm normal.
- Normal?


219
0:13:13,48 --> 0:13:17,4
What other grown man
makes soldiers for his runny egg


220
0:13:17,4 --> 0:13:19,56
and then divides them into rank?


221
0:13:19,56 --> 0:13:21,32
- Just a bit of fun.
- Yeah?


222
0:13:21,32 --> 0:13:24,72
- So I can eat this one?
- Don't touch the colonel!


223
0:13:24,72 --> 0:13:27,8
It'll upset the rest of the men.


224
0:13:27,8 --> 0:13:30,88
Call a shrink, you're nuts.

And then raise your hands up
and say, "Hello!"

- (Strained) Hello, sun.

0:14:0,96 --> 0:14:2,84
do you fancy some toast?


236
0:14:2,84 --> 0:14:4,56
Wheat is poison.

0:14:4,56 --> 0:14:7,28
I can't believe you had chocolate.


238
0:14:7,28 --> 0:14:8,96
You didn't have meat, did you?


239
0:14:8,96 --> 0:14:13,88
No! No, no, no, no.


240
0:14:13,88 --> 0:14:16,72
Well, just a little bit of chicken.

Ah, right. How about a special treat?


250
0:14:49,68 --> 0:14:52,12
Is it that carrot thing again?

0:14:52,12 --> 0:14:54,6
Come on.
I'm not a total killjoy, you know.


252
0:14:54,6 --> 0:15:19,28
You sit tight and I'll rustle us up
some naughty rice cakes.

- Stripping the chicken.

- What for?
- I could make soup, salad, sandwiches.


260
0:16:15,64 --> 0:16:19,52
Or a chicken cravat but it's just hassle.
We'll get a takeaway.


261

- Loads I could do with this.
- It's a chicken!


262
0:16:22,44 --> 0:16:24,36
Chicken is finite.


263
0:16:24,36 --> 0:16:27,28
You've got to move on.
What if somebody dies?


264
0:16:27,28 --> 0:16:30,88
- I'll use the legs. It's thrifty.
- It's disgusting.


265
0:16:30,88 --> 0:16:34,8
This is how Jeffrey Dahmer
and that lot get started.

You can't let go. Old boxes
of fried chicken lying around.

0:17:0,92 --> 0:17:2,72
So I made him an appointment.

If you two could do something relaxing
together things wouldn't be so tense.

What? Every time we bicker
we should have sex?


279
0:17:20,48 --> 0:17:23,32
Just have a drink and be yourself again.


280
0:17:23,32 --> 0:17:27,52
So what's it's like, then?
Fags and booze?


281
0:17:27,52 --> 0:17:31,2
To be honest,
after years of smoking and drinking


282
0:17:31,2 --> 0:17:33,8

0:17:33,8 --> 0:17:35,2
Yep.

Yep.

he's fundamentally a bad person...


292
0:18:7,6 --> 0:18:10,12
Well, I suppose he might be.


293
0:18:10,12 --> 0:18:12,84
I mean, it's not a bad life after all.


294
0:18:12,84 --> 0:18:15,84
Obviously, there's the cooking,
the cleaning,


295

doing the accounts,
making the cheese, scraping the beds.


296

But you know, l-I'm happy, really.

322
0:20:14,72 --> 0:20:16,8
Now, look here...


323
0:20:16,8 --> 0:20:20,24
Shouldn't you be serving
a customer or something?


324
0:20:20,24 --> 0:20:24,36
And isn't it about time
you had a really good scrub?


325
0:20:24,36 --> 0:20:27,92
It's not my fault I look like this.
You haven't washed my things.


326
0:20:27,92 --> 0:20:31,32
Ah. We can't blame others
for our appearance, can we?


327
0:20:31,32 --> 0:20:34,4
No, no, no, but...


328
0:20:34,4 --> 0:20:38,36
I suggest you wash your own socks,
if you can chisel them out of your shoes.


329
0:20:38,36 --> 0:20:42,24
I'm going for a nap
and I don't want to be disturbed.


330
0:20:42,24 --> 0:20:49,6
How dare you speak to me like that!
My own son.

332
0:20:51,84 --> 0:20:57,96
Nothing. Nothing.


333
0:20:57,96 --> 0:21:2,2
It's as Freud says.
You know, the unconscious thing.

0:21:4,88 --> 0:21:8,72
That's exactly what he's like.


336
0:21:8,72 --> 0:21:11,48
It's not as if he's never rewarded.


337
0:21:11,48 --> 0:21:13,88
Maybe not in any material way...


338
0:21:13,88 --> 0:21:20,12
or any other way, but still.


339
0:21:20,12 --> 0:21:23,84
I may have been a little hard on him.


340
0:21:23,84 --> 0:21:30,32
But he leaves boxes in the hall!
I nearly tripped and...


341
0:21:30,32 --> 0:21:33,36
Yes, yes, I'm a monster,
I know, it's not his fault,


342
0:21:33,36 --> 0:21:34,84
I'm a terrible bastard.
