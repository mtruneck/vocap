0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:6,832



2
0:0:6,832 --> 0:0:9,67
JUDY MESSOLINE: We have pretty
bizarre things happen here.


3
0:0:9,67 --> 0:0:12,306



4
0:0:12,306 --> 0:0:15,73
Most of the people I know down
here have seen something


5
0:0:15,73 --> 0:0:17,182
bizarre at one time
or another.


6
0:0:17,182 --> 0:0:20,14



7
0:0:20,14 --> 0:0:22,71
No, we don't discuss it a whole
bunch, but they believe.


8
0:0:22,71 --> 0:0:25,632



9
0:0:25,632 --> 0:0:27,44
They think there's something
going on, too.


10
0:0:27,44 --> 0:0:44,134



11
0:0:44,134 --> 0:0:46,93
My partner and I moved to the
San Luis Valley to raise


12
0:0:46,93 --> 0:0:54,46
cattle, did not move here for
UFOs, and didn't even realize


13
0:0:54,46 --> 0:0:58,31
that this was a hot spot of
the nation for sightings.


14
0:0:58,31 --> 0:1:0,22
And I knew nothing about
them anyway.


15
0:1:0,22 --> 0:1:4,336



16
0:1:4,336 --> 0:1:8,29
Well, then I started meeting
some of the locals down here.


17
0:1:8,29 --> 0:1:10,695
And they all had UFO stories--


18
0:1:10,695 --> 0:1:14,4
I mean, one after another after
another, even to the


19
0:1:14,4 --> 0:1:17,97
point where there was a real
estate company years ago that


20
0:1:17,97 --> 0:1:20,87
would make people who bought
land from them sign a


21
0:1:20,87 --> 0:1:25,7
disclaimer saying that they were
aware that there was UFO


22
0:1:25,7 --> 0:1:28,736
activity in this valley.


23
0:1:28,736 --> 0:1:32,43
So anyway, it got to the point
I'd giggle and say, we need a


24
0:1:32,43 --> 0:1:36,4
UFO watchtower, never ever
thinking I'd ever do it.


25
0:1:36,4 --> 0:1:39,5
Well, after four and a half
years of struggling with cows,


26
0:1:39,5 --> 0:1:42,4
because they don't eat
sand really well,


27
0:1:42,4 --> 0:1:43,36
they about broke me.


28
0:1:43,36 --> 0:1:47,432
So I was talking to one of the
farmers one day and I said,


29
0:1:47,432 --> 0:1:48,69
I've had to sell the cows.


30
0:1:48,69 --> 0:1:50,25
I don't want to sell my land.


31
0:1:50,25 --> 0:1:53,83
And he said, you need to put
up that UFO watchtower you


32
0:1:53,83 --> 0:1:54,41
giggled about.


33
0:1:54,41 --> 0:1:55,66
You'd have fun.


34
0:1:55,66 --> 0:2:3,51



35
0:2:3,51 --> 0:2:5,34
It was just going
to be a little


36
0:2:5,34 --> 0:2:7,6
old mom and pop business.


37
0:2:7,6 --> 0:2:10,669
We'd be open in the summer,
closed in the winter, catch


38
0:2:10,669 --> 0:2:17,48
that tourist traffic off the
highway, never thinking we


39
0:2:17,48 --> 0:2:18,89
would ever see anything
from here.


40
0:2:18,89 --> 0:2:23,636
I mean, that was not
even a vision.


41
0:2:23,636 --> 0:2:26,755
Well, from the time we opened,
we started seeing things.


42
0:2:26,755 --> 0:2:35,415
And as of now, and this is
November, we have had 67


43
0:2:35,415 --> 0:2:37,99
sightings from just here
since we opened.


44
0:2:37,99 --> 0:2:43,701



45
0:2:43,701 --> 0:2:47,376
One night we had about
60 people over here.


46
0:2:47,376 --> 0:2:49,955
And there was a couple sitting
up from on the bench.


47
0:2:49,955 --> 0:2:52,325
And the woman jumps
up just screaming.


48
0:2:52,325 --> 0:2:53,31
Do you see them?


49
0:2:53,31 --> 0:2:54,44
Do you see them?


50
0:2:54,44 --> 0:2:57,3
They were so high up that if she
hadn't pointed them out, I


51
0:2:57,3 --> 0:2:58,45
would have never seen them.


52
0:2:58,45 --> 0:3:1,43
And there was one here and one
here, and they were moving


53
0:3:1,43 --> 0:3:3,92
remarkably fast towards
the north.


54
0:3:3,92 --> 0:3:7,36
The one in the front stopped,
and it waited for the one


55
0:3:7,36 --> 0:3:8,55
behind to catch up.


56
0:3:8,55 --> 0:3:11,776
And when that one caught up, the
two of them took off, and


57
0:3:11,776 --> 0:3:14,4
there was a streak of light
across the sky.


58
0:3:14,4 --> 0:3:19,45
Another night it looked like a
shooting star, and it was over


59
0:3:19,45 --> 0:3:22,42
here on the other side
of the sand dunes.


60
0:3:22,42 --> 0:3:23,59
And it's coming down.


61
0:3:23,59 --> 0:3:26,52
I'm watching this shooting
star, OK?


62
0:3:26,52 --> 0:3:29,66
And it gets below the peaks of
the mountains, and it lost its


63
0:3:29,66 --> 0:3:32,925
momentum, and it started
to float like this.


64
0:3:32,925 --> 0:3:35,26
Well see, that makes sense
to my weird mind.


65
0:3:35,26 --> 0:3:38,36
But anyway, what didn't
make sense is it went


66
0:3:38,36 --> 0:3:39,332
straight back up.


67
0:3:39,332 --> 0:3:44,27
So it wasn't a shooting star.


68
0:3:44,27 --> 0:3:46,46
So many bizarre things
have happened here


69
0:3:46,46 --> 0:3:47,93
in the last 12 years.


70
0:3:47,93 --> 0:3:53,47
And I tell folks, maybe
you don't quite get


71
0:3:53,47 --> 0:3:55,3
all of this, OK?


72
0:3:55,3 --> 0:3:57,83
But you better have an open
mind, because something's


73
0:3:57,83 --> 0:3:59,58
going on up there in
that cosmos, so we


74
0:3:59,58 --> 0:4:1,16
just don't know about.


75
0:4:1,16 --> 0:4:3,32
And do I believe now?


76
0:4:3,32 --> 0:4:4,57
You betcha.


77
0:4:4,57 --> 0:4:13,852



78
0:4:13,852 --> 0:4:16,7
JAY YOUNG: I've seen some
pretty strange things.


79
0:4:16,7 --> 0:4:21,624
I've seen things that I've never
even heard of before.


80
0:4:21,624 --> 0:4:23,89
I think there's a lot of things
in this universe that


81
0:4:23,89 --> 0:4:27,32
we don't understand, and maybe
we're not meant to.


82
0:4:27,32 --> 0:4:29,125
Elvis.


83
0:4:29,125 --> 0:4:30,92
Here, buddy, buddy.


84
0:4:30,92 --> 0:4:33,831
Oh, there he is.


85
0:4:33,831 --> 0:4:36,194
How you doing big dog?


86
0:4:36,194 --> 0:4:37,142
Hey.


87
0:4:37,142 --> 0:4:43,7
[ALLIGATOR HISSING]


88
0:4:43,7 --> 0:4:44,99
JAY YOUNG: How's my big boy?


89
0:4:44,99 --> 0:4:45,62
Yes.


90
0:4:45,62 --> 0:4:46,83
How's my big boy?


91
0:4:46,83 --> 0:4:49,23
I was born in Texas, but I had
the good sense to move to


92
0:4:49,23 --> 0:4:53,29
Colorado when I was six months
old and been in the valley


93
0:4:53,29 --> 0:4:55,91
almost ever since.


94
0:4:55,91 --> 0:4:59,33
My name is Jay Young, and I'm
the manager of Colorado Gators


95
0:4:59,33 --> 0:5:0,685
Reptile Park.


96
0:5:0,685 --> 0:5:2,6
I've known Judy for quite
a while, I guess.


97
0:5:2,6 --> 0:5:5,42
I went to the UFO watchtower
probably the first


98
0:5:5,42 --> 0:5:7,27
year she opened it.


99
0:5:7,27 --> 0:5:8,41
It was a novel idea.


100
0:5:8,41 --> 0:5:10,5
She knew there was all
these sightings in


101
0:5:10,5 --> 0:5:11,29
the San Luis Valley.


102
0:5:11,29 --> 0:5:14,16
And as she's told you,
I'm sure, she's seen


103
0:5:14,16 --> 0:5:16,421
things since then.


104
0:5:16,421 --> 0:5:18,766
Do you know about Snippy
the horse, right?


105
0:5:18,766 --> 0:5:23,2
First documented animal
mutilation, possible UFO


106
0:5:23,2 --> 0:5:26,36
mutilation, happened here in
the San Luis Valley back in


107
0:5:26,36 --> 0:5:28,5
the late '60s.


108
0:5:28,5 --> 0:5:31,21
And it was a horse named
Snippy the horse.


109
0:5:31,21 --> 0:5:33,643
It was just totally
stripped bare.


110
0:5:33,643 --> 0:5:37,285
But where the meat ended on
the neck, the flesh was


111
0:5:37,285 --> 0:5:38,265
cauterized.


112
0:5:38,265 --> 0:5:41,83
There was no blood in the
horse's body, and there were


113
0:5:41,83 --> 0:5:47,905
no signs of any predators or
anything strange around it.


114
0:5:47,905 --> 0:5:49,95
We just found this horse
with the flesh


115
0:5:49,95 --> 0:5:51,44
missing off of its head.


116
0:5:51,44 --> 0:5:53,41
And we had an ostrich
disappear.


117
0:5:53,41 --> 0:5:54,68
It's missing to this day.


118
0:5:54,68 --> 0:5:56,685
It's been four years now.


119
0:5:56,685 --> 0:5:59,312
Nobody ever saw this ostrich.


120
0:5:59,312 --> 0:6:2,9
So we decided to name
him Snippy, if he


121
0:6:2,9 --> 0:6:3,34
ever does show up.


122
0:6:3,34 --> 0:6:8,76



123
0:6:8,76 --> 0:6:13,31
I think the San Luis Valley
probably draws a lot of


124
0:6:13,31 --> 0:6:17,58
supernatural or extraterrestrial
activity


125
0:6:17,58 --> 0:6:19,895
possibly because of the
geothermal water.


126
0:6:19,895 --> 0:6:22,35
And there's a lot of crazy
people here who probably see


127
0:6:22,35 --> 0:6:25,66
things that they didn't
actually see, too.


128
0:6:25,66 --> 0:6:28,325
And then, the San Luis Valley
draws strange people, so it


129
0:6:28,325 --> 0:6:31,8
might as well draw strange
aircraft as well.


130
0:6:31,8 --> 0:6:36,42



131
0:6:36,42 --> 0:6:38,66
JUDY MESSOLINE: Some say that
its the vastness of the


132
0:6:38,66 --> 0:6:43,78
valley, because it's so huge
and not highly populated.


133
0:6:43,78 --> 0:6:47,37
Others say it's a spiritually
of the valley.


134
0:6:47,37 --> 0:6:49,345
Others say that there's
an E.T. base in


135
0:6:49,345 --> 0:6:51,445
Mount Blanca over here.


136
0:6:51,445 --> 0:6:55,14
Well, all of this sounds
really good.


137
0:6:55,14 --> 0:6:58,302
But it didn't make
sense to my mind.


138
0:6:58,302 --> 0:7:0,32
Then I got a magazine
from Great Britain.


139
0:7:0,32 --> 0:7:3,2
And in that magazine it said
that the majority of their


140
0:7:3,2 --> 0:7:6,4
sightings was where there
were hot water wells.


141
0:7:6,4 --> 0:7:9,266
That makes sense.


142
0:7:9,266 --> 0:7:11,77
From one end to this valley
to the other, we


143
0:7:11,77 --> 0:7:13,2
have geothermal water.


144
0:7:13,2 --> 0:7:15,969



145
0:7:15,969 --> 0:7:17,33
JAY YOUNG: We have very little


146
0:7:17,33 --> 0:7:19,575
atmosphere here at our elevation.


147
0:7:19,575 --> 0:7:21,785
We have very little pollution.


148
0:7:21,785 --> 0:7:24,472
We have very clear skies.


149
0:7:24,472 --> 0:7:28,51
We do a lot of watching just
from our front yard.


150
0:7:28,51 --> 0:7:33,35
Judy built a nice place for
people to go and hang out that


151
0:7:33,35 --> 0:7:34,79
didn't have a front yard here.


152
0:7:34,79 --> 0:7:45,391



153
0:7:45,391 --> 0:7:49,24
JUDY MESSOLINE: The folks who
come here to visit, first


154
0:7:49,24 --> 0:7:53,426
thing I ask is have you ever
had any UFO experiences?


155
0:7:53,426 --> 0:7:55,53
Some will come right out
and say, oh yeah.


156
0:7:55,53 --> 0:7:59,87
But folks have made
fun of them for


157
0:7:59,87 --> 0:8:2,632
relating their stories.


158
0:8:2,632 --> 0:8:5,4
And I said, how can
people do that?


159
0:8:5,4 --> 0:8:9,118
People have these experiences,
don't make fun of them.


160
0:8:9,118 --> 0:8:15,894



161
0:8:15,894 --> 0:8:18,54
DAN: Everyone, whether they're
skeptical or not, everybody


162
0:8:18,54 --> 0:8:21,4
wants to think we're
not alone.


163
0:8:21,4 --> 0:8:25,47
Yeah, I've seen lights in the
sky and objects that seem to


164
0:8:25,47 --> 0:8:30,225
hover and then take
off quickly.


165
0:8:30,225 --> 0:8:31,63
AMANDA: I was up in
the mountains with


166
0:8:31,63 --> 0:8:33,254
my friend near Denver.


167
0:8:33,254 --> 0:8:36,559
And it was the middle of the
day, and we saw something that


168
0:8:36,559 --> 0:8:37,94
was just hovering
for a long time.


169
0:8:37,94 --> 0:8:41,639
It was just like an orb that was
brightening and dimming.


170
0:8:41,639 --> 0:8:44,169
But it was still for a really
long time, and then it moved.


171
0:8:44,169 --> 0:8:46,23
JOE: I just left my house.


172
0:8:46,23 --> 0:8:49,58
I was on my way into town and
had some lights coming over


173
0:8:49,58 --> 0:8:52,73
towards us from where
Blanca is.


174
0:8:52,73 --> 0:8:55,62
And as it was coming towards
us, it seemed to come down,


175
0:8:55,62 --> 0:8:57,41
get brighter and brighter
as it was coming down.


176
0:8:57,41 --> 0:8:59,385
It was a pretty good ways
up there, though.


177
0:8:59,385 --> 0:9:3,3
And all of a sudden, it went
from going straight at us and


178
0:9:3,3 --> 0:9:6,52
took an immediate right and went
off and just disappeared


179
0:9:6,52 --> 0:9:8,12
off into the sky.


180
0:9:8,12 --> 0:9:11,76
KENNY: We have what we call
the mystery lights.


181
0:9:11,76 --> 0:9:13,942
It's lights we see over
top of the mountains,


182
0:9:13,942 --> 0:9:15,57
not moving, not blinking.


183
0:9:15,57 --> 0:9:18,55
So it's not really an airplane
or nothing, doesn't look quite


184
0:9:18,55 --> 0:9:19,365
like a star.


185
0:9:19,365 --> 0:9:21,74
So we don't really know what
it is, so we just called it


186
0:9:21,74 --> 0:9:23,336
mystery lights.


187
0:9:23,336 --> 0:9:25,61
JAY YOUNG: I'm driving up
Highway 17 one night.


188
0:9:25,61 --> 0:9:28,57
I saw three lights
off to the left.


189
0:9:28,57 --> 0:9:33,74
And then they went over
the mountains in


190
0:9:33,74 --> 0:9:35,28
less than 10 seconds.


191
0:9:35,28 --> 0:9:39,11
I calculated it out that there
was no sonic boom from them


192
0:9:39,11 --> 0:9:41,9
taking off, breaking
the sound barrier.


193
0:9:41,9 --> 0:9:42,165
So that was strange.


194
0:9:42,165 --> 0:9:44,39
And then I calculated it out.


195
0:9:44,39 --> 0:9:47,89
They were going upwards of
21,000 miles per hour.


196
0:9:47,89 --> 0:9:49,66
JOSH: I've actually never
experienced anything.


197
0:9:49,66 --> 0:9:52,1
And I've never seen anything
myself in the area.


198
0:9:52,1 --> 0:9:53,79
But I believe it.


199
0:9:53,79 --> 0:9:56,75
In the cities and valley,
there's a lot of stuff going


200
0:9:56,75 --> 0:9:57,41
on, a lot of buildings.


201
0:9:57,41 --> 0:9:59,84
But out here in the open,
you can really see


202
0:9:59,84 --> 0:10:1,73
everything in the sky.


203
0:10:1,73 --> 0:10:3,76
I'm sure there has been plenty
of sightings out here.


204
0:10:3,76 --> 0:10:5,1
There's plenty of room for it.


205
0:10:5,1 --> 0:10:8,856



206
0:10:8,856 --> 0:10:10,84
JUDY MESSOLINE: If
extraterrestrials were mean,


207
0:10:10,84 --> 0:10:13,13
we wouldn't be here, kids.


208
0:10:13,13 --> 0:10:17,734
Because their technology is
so much greater than ours.


209
0:10:17,734 --> 0:10:18,984
We wouldn't be here.


210
0:10:18,984 --> 0:10:21,446



211
0:10:21,446 --> 0:10:22,89
There's a painting over there.


212
0:10:22,89 --> 0:10:25,65
And the woman who did the
painting is an abductee.


213
0:10:25,65 --> 0:10:28,78
She has been abducted
for, oh gosh, since


214
0:10:28,78 --> 0:10:30,595
she was just a child.


215
0:10:30,595 --> 0:10:32,66
And she's 50 now.


216
0:10:32,66 --> 0:10:37,815
And now she tries to make it
a positive experience.


217
0:10:37,815 --> 0:10:39,15
And yeah, she was scared.


218
0:10:39,15 --> 0:10:40,39
But that's human nature.


219
0:10:40,39 --> 0:10:42,76
We're going to be scared
about the unknown.


220
0:10:42,76 --> 0:10:46,554



221
0:10:46,554 --> 0:10:49,33
I used to watch Mulder
on TV and stuff.


222
0:10:49,33 --> 0:10:54,6
But as far as really being into
it, I was a horse person.


223
0:10:54,6 --> 0:10:59,16
I was not somebody that was out
here staring at the sky


224
0:10:59,16 --> 0:11:0,1
all the time.


225
0:11:0,1 --> 0:11:5,13
Now, I wish I would have taken
the time to stare at the sky,


226
0:11:5,13 --> 0:11:11,52
because there's some amazing
stuff that goes on up there.


227
0:11:11,52 --> 0:11:15,63
You look at all the turmoil
that we go through here on


228
0:11:15,63 --> 0:11:19,49
Earth and the changes,
and there has to


229
0:11:19,49 --> 0:11:20,74
be something better.


230
0:11:20,74 --> 0:13:20,74
