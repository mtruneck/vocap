1
0:1:17,663 --> 0:1:21,93
Tallis and me wagered
on who would get to you first,


2
0:1:21,93 --> 0:1:35,755
us or the mage.


3
0:1:35,755 --> 0:1:37,858
What?


4
0:1:37,858 --> 0:1:40,688
I was just thinking about our deal...


5
0:1:40,688 --> 0:1:44,909
The Chantry wants Saarebas alive,
but you intend to kill him.


6
0:1:44,909 --> 0:1:51,134
That is, if you win our duel.


7
0:1:51,134 --> 0:1:54,195
You were never intending on going back.


8
0:1:54,195 --> 0:1:57,906
When I left Kirkwall,
I knew there was no going back.


9
0:1:57,906 --> 0:1:59,821
I have no regrets.


10
0:1:59,821 --> 0:2:5,34
The mage deserves to die.
You know that as well as I do.


11
0:2:5,34 --> 0:2:7,353
Doesn't matter what I know.


12
0:2:7,353 --> 0:2:12,167
The Qunari want him back alive.
That's my mission.


13
0:2:12,167 --> 0:2:14,738
I can't mess up again.


14
0:2:14,738 --> 0:2:17,661
Sooner or later you will disobey
another order.


15
0:2:17,661 --> 0:2:20,73
You can't change who you are.


16
0:2:20,73 --> 0:2:25,198
Then they'll do more than demote you.


17
0:2:25,198 --> 0:2:28,6
Show me an alternative.


18
0:2:28,6 --> 0:2:30,425
Free yourself.


19
0:2:30,425 --> 0:2:34,34
As I have done.


20
0:2:34,34 --> 0:2:36,77
Are you suggesting
that we run off together?


21
0:2:36,77 --> 0:2:39,299
That I become Tal-Vashoth?


22
0:2:39,299 --> 0:2:40,81
What's Tal-Vashoth?


23
0:2:40,81 --> 0:2:46,684
One who abandons the Qun.
An exile, forever outcast.


24
0:2:46,684 --> 0:2:50,307
From what I've seen,
that's exactly what you are.


25
0:2:50,307 --> 0:2:52,414
You said it yourself...


26
0:2:52,414 --> 0:2:56,3
We're both renegades.


27
0:2:56,3 --> 0:2:57,812
I suppose...


28
0:2:57,812 --> 0:3:5,54
Although we see the pit,
we cannot avoid it.


29
0:3:5,54 --> 0:3:7,61
What are you doing?


30
0:3:7,61 --> 0:3:20,832
Falling into the pit.


31
0:3:20,832 --> 0:3:25,817
Hey, boy, see that?


32
0:3:25,817 --> 0:3:29,947
I like to blow off a bit of steam too,
just before battle.


33
0:3:29,947 --> 0:3:32,893
You up for it?


34
0:3:32,893 --> 0:3:34,631
No!


35
0:3:34,631 --> 0:3:37,254
I'm betrothed to Fina.
Have you not been listening?


36
0:3:37,254 --> 0:3:40,643
You're going to get torn up
by a demon army soon enough!


37
0:3:40,643 --> 0:3:42,612
You done it before, right?


38
0:3:42,612 --> 0:3:47,9
No.
Never!


39
0:3:47,9 --> 0:3:52,256
Then get here and practice,
for Fina's sake!


40
0:3:52,256 --> 0:3:54,929
Hey, you two!


41
0:3:54,929 --> 0:4:8,45
Over here!


42
0:4:8,45 --> 0:4:13,492
[Saarebas]
At last!


43
0:4:13,492 --> 0:4:18,674
Fina!


44
0:4:18,674 --> 0:4:21,814
Josmael and I will sneak
around the back, closest to the altar.


45
0:4:21,814 --> 0:4:23,8
Get the girl out before attacking.


46
0:4:23,8 --> 0:4:25,175
Really?


47
0:4:25,175 --> 0:4:26,142
But your mission...


48
0:4:26,142 --> 0:4:29,11
Will get done one way or another.


49
0:4:29,11 --> 0:4:32,545
I can't be all Qunari after all...


50
0:4:32,545 --> 0:4:49,0
No use denying it.


51
0:4:49,0 --> 0:4:51,814
Move!
Let's go!


52
0:4:51,814 --> 0:5:4,194
For the first time in my life,
I am not the weapon, I wield it.


53
0:5:4,194 --> 0:5:11,745
Fina!
Fina!


54
0:5:11,745 --> 0:5:13,94
Saarebas, they're here!


55
0:5:13,94 --> 0:5:32,162
What?


56
0:5:32,162 --> 0:5:44,816
What more appropriate audience
for a night of death and destruction.


57
0:5:44,816 --> 0:5:53,33
Go on Templar, I got this!


58
0:5:53,33 --> 0:6:0,54
I think not, Saarebas!


59
0:6:0,54 --> 0:6:3,14
Love, why did you warn them?


60
0:6:3,14 --> 0:6:5,565
All I've ever been was the girl
you were to marry.


61
0:6:5,565 --> 0:6:10,537
I wasn't special
until Saarebas captured me!


62
0:6:10,537 --> 0:6:13,689
A little blood...


63
0:6:13,689 --> 0:6:24,39
...for a lot of power!


64
0:6:24,39 --> 0:6:53,507
Fina...


65
0:6:53,507 --> 0:6:56,873
My sister!


66
0:6:56,873 --> 0:7:1,664
No!!!!


67
0:7:1,664 --> 0:7:3,231
Fen'Harel...


68
0:7:3,231 --> 0:7:14,809
Thank thee for thy wondrous tools!


69
0:7:14,809 --> 0:7:17,475
I owe you thanks, Templar.


70
0:7:17,475 --> 0:7:20,689
Such freedom you've given me.


71
0:7:20,689 --> 0:7:24,312
A gift for killing your family, perhaps.


72
0:7:24,312 --> 0:7:27,63
You will bait me no longer, mage!


73
0:7:27,63 --> 0:7:41,385
You may take my family,
but my future will be my own!


74
0:7:41,385 --> 0:7:50,148
[Nyree]
Nice one!


75
0:7:50,148 --> 0:7:53,127
Tallis!


76
0:7:53,127 --> 0:8:5,149
Stop the blood!


77
0:8:5,149 --> 0:8:14,676
You...


78
0:8:14,676 --> 0:8:16,714
Tallis!


79
0:8:16,714 --> 0:8:26,425
[Screams]


80
0:8:26,425 --> 0:8:27,57
Cairn...


81
0:8:27,57 --> 0:8:28,687
Cairn!


82
0:8:28,687 --> 0:8:32,614
Cairn! Cairn!
Josmael, come quick, heal him!


83
0:8:32,614 --> 0:8:34,41
Heal him!


84
0:8:34,41 --> 0:8:37,46
There's no healing that, lovey.


85
0:8:37,46 --> 0:8:39,594
But...


86
0:8:39,594 --> 0:8:43,17
...our duel.


87
0:8:43,17 --> 0:8:46,78
[Saarebas laughs]


88
0:8:46,78 --> 0:8:51,279
Well, this has been an amusing respite.


89
0:8:51,279 --> 0:8:54,47
You serve your title well, elf.


90
0:8:54,47 --> 0:8:58,515
Tallis true.


91
0:8:58,515 --> 0:8:59,957
Why?


92
0:8:59,957 --> 0:9:4,154
Why this?
Why not just escape and live your life?


93
0:9:4,154 --> 0:9:8,846
I had the means to do harm,
so I took it.


94
0:9:8,846 --> 0:9:12,928
It was almost... involuntary.


95
0:9:12,928 --> 0:9:16,75
How could I deny my function?


96
0:9:16,75 --> 0:9:20,245
The Qunari made me this way.


97
0:9:20,245 --> 0:9:23,955
As they have made you.


98
0:9:23,955 --> 0:9:26,55
You're right...


99
0:9:26,55 --> 0:9:32,756
No matter how hard we fight it,
eventually we follow our true nature.


100
0:9:32,756 --> 0:9:37,808
You can't be faulted for that.


101
0:9:37,808 --> 0:9:41,891
And neither can I.


102
0:9:41,891 --> 0:9:54,901
This is for Cairn!


103
0:9:54,901 --> 0:9:57,448
Here...


104
0:9:57,448 --> 0:9:59,924
Don't force it.


105
0:9:59,924 --> 0:10:1,982
You got to dig down a bit.


106
0:10:1,982 --> 0:10:9,37
Here...


107
0:10:9,37 --> 0:10:11,675
I'm going to walk the lad
back to his people.


108
0:10:11,675 --> 0:10:15,12
It's along my way.
I'm heading back to Nevarra myself.


109
0:10:15,12 --> 0:10:21,241
Get myself clear of the blasted law.


110
0:10:21,241 --> 0:10:26,142
The balance.


111
0:10:26,142 --> 0:10:29,873
Doesn't feel much like a victory, huh?


112
0:10:29,873 --> 0:10:34,544
Not really.


113
0:10:34,544 --> 0:10:38,108
I thought you might want this...


114
0:10:38,108 --> 0:10:42,102
To remember.


115
0:10:42,102 --> 0:10:48,74
Thank you.


116
0:10:48,74 --> 0:10:50,799
Goodbye Josmael.


117
0:10:50,799 --> 0:10:53,32
One day you'll make a fine Keeper!


118
0:10:53,32 --> 0:10:55,389
Not one day...


119
0:10:55,389 --> 0:10:59,342
I am the Keeper.
I know my duty.


120
0:10:59,342 --> 0:11:2,716
Thank you, Tallis.


121
0:11:2,716 --> 0:11:6,726
Your Qunari gonna be right peeved
with you not showing up with the mage.


122
0:11:6,726 --> 0:11:9,26
There's a smart move,
just lay it all on the Templar.


123
0:11:9,26 --> 0:11:11,131
No!


124
0:11:11,131 --> 0:11:14,726
I'll finish my mission my way.


125
0:11:14,726 --> 0:11:17,793
Right, renegade.


126
0:11:17,793 --> 0:11:24,552
Who knows? Next time you see me
I might not be Tallis anymore.


127
0:11:24,552 --> 0:11:44,511
I could be Tal-Vashoth.


128
0:11:44,511 --> 0:11:47,88
Past the idea of right and wrong,
there is a field.


129
0:11:47,88 --> 0:11:53,714
When a soul lies down in that grass,
the world is in balance.


130
0:11:53,714 --> 0:12:3,841
I will meet you there.


131
0:12:3,841 --> 0:14:3,841
Subtitles: Dani Figueiredo.
