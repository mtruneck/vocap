Tonight, I can report to the

that the United States

is the irony of the fact that
bin Laden was found there.

heard a lot of people say that
it was highly unlikely that


75
0:4:39,29 --> 0:4:42,97
bin Laden lived in that
house in this town.

0:4:42,97 --> 0:4:45,5
What is your view on that?


77
0:4:45,5 --> 0:4:49,33
ABRAR RASHEED: To tell you
frankly, still I am unable to


78
0:4:49,33 --> 0:4:52,81
believe that Osama bin Laden was
here in the first place.


79
0:4:52,81 --> 0:4:57,3
Like so many other Pakistanis,
it's very hard for me to


80
0:4:57,3 --> 0:4:58,75
believe that he was here.

0:4:58,75 --> 0:5:0,63
And especially the people
of Abbottabad.


82

businessmen, traders, or


85

you that he believes that


86
0:5:13,72 --> 0:5:16,88
Osama bin Laden was here living
in Abbottabad, which is


87
0:5:16,88 --> 0:5:18,24
a garrison town.


88
0:5:18,24 --> 0:5:23,2

bin Laden wasn't there.

And being American ally in
this war, 5,300 military


204
0:12:18,51 --> 0:12:20,48
personnel lost their life.


205
0:12:20,48 --> 0:12:25,92
$68 billion to $69 billion,
Pakistan suffered this loss.


206
0:12:25,92 --> 0:12:30,89
And against that amount,
Pakistan got $20 billion, out


207
0:12:30,89 --> 0:12:34,7
of which I think $13 billion
were paid to the Pakistan


208
0:12:34,7 --> 0:12:39,89
military and $7-8 billion to
the civilian government.


209
0:12:39,89 --> 0:12:42,93
Pakistan has sacrificed
a lot, and in return,


210
0:12:42,93 --> 0:12:45,1
what we have got?


211
0:12:45,1 --> 0:12:53,31
Humiliation, taunts, and demands
of do more, do more.


212
0:12:53,31 --> 0:12:56,39
Americans and the Western
world should realize


213
0:12:56,39 --> 0:12:57,63
Pakistan's sacrifices.


214
0:12:57,63 --> 0:13:2,0
And now they should be aware of
another thing, that there


215
0:13:2,0 --> 0:13:5,86
are very, very strong
anti-American


216
0:13:5,86 --> 0:13:7,91
sentiments in Pakistan.


217
0:13:7,91 --> 0:13:10,68
Not only in the general public,
not only in the common


218
0:13:10,68 --> 0:13:13,57
masses, but now even
in the media.


219
0:13:13,57 --> 0:13:16,62
Even no political leaders, even
the popular political


220
0:13:16,62 --> 0:13:20,79
parties can't publicly praise
America anymore.


221
0:13:20,79 --> 0:13:23,475
Because they know that they
can face the backlash.

SUROOSH ALVI: There's another
smaller bomb site.


224
0:13:28,66 --> 0:13:31,15
A convoy of cars from the
US consulate drove by


225
0:13:31,15 --> 0:13:32,78
here a few days ago.


226
0:13:32,78 --> 0:13:35,36
And there was a car situated
right here.


227
0:13:35,36 --> 0:13:38,4
It exploded when the
Americans drove by.


228
0:13:38,4 --> 0:13:40,4
It was a Taliban attack.


229
0:13:40,4 --> 0:13:45,34
And yet another example of
how the Osama bin Laden


230

this country.


231

down someone from the Taliban,

tracking them down.

two journalists

240
0:14:5,37 --> 0:14:8,692
I wrote down some questions for
them to ask on my behalf.


241
0:14:8,692 --> 0:14:10,885
Well, I would love to get on
the phone with the Taliban.


242
0:14:10,885 --> 0:14:14,1
Can we try to call them and see
if we could speak to them?

SUROOSH ALVI: According to the
spokesperson for the Pakistani


268
0:16:7,46 --> 0:16:10,33
Taliban, their party line is
that they're only after


269
0:16:10,33 --> 0:16:11,78
government institutions.


270
0:16:11,78 --> 0:16:13,42
But the reality is
very different.


271
0:16:13,42 --> 0:16:16,6
In the communities, people
have been terrorized,


272
0:16:16,6 --> 0:16:18,59
kidnapped, and killed
by the Taliban.


273
0:16:18,59 --> 0:16:21,35
And because the army and the
police have failed to help


274
0:16:21,35 --> 0:16:24,51
these people, a lot of them have
formed their own militias


275
0:16:24,51 --> 0:16:24,97
called lashkars.


276
0:16:24,97 --> 0:16:27,136
And they've taken matters
into their own hands.

0:16:29,872 --> 0:16:31,88
I'm standing outside of
Faheem Khan's place.


279
0:16:31,88 --> 0:16:35,34
He's the head of the lashkar,
which is a militia that


280
0:16:35,34 --> 0:16:37,49
protects the neighborhood,
the village, and the


281
0:16:37,49 --> 0:16:38,4

We're right on the edge of

We tried to go back when we

0:20:11,63 --> 0:20:14,97
Just four kilometers that way
is the gun market where we


341
0:20:14,97 --> 0:20:16,69

on this trip, we wanted to
