1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:11,362



2
0:0:11,362 --> 0:0:12,44
ALEJANDRA GAITAN:
So hi, everyone.


3
0:0:12,44 --> 0:0:14,416
I just saw this video
of a dog--


4
0:0:14,416 --> 0:0:14,91
FEMALE SPEAKER 1: --at
a vet's office--


5
0:0:14,91 --> 0:0:17,43
MEGAN LEE HEART: --giving
the person behind


6
0:0:17,43 --> 0:0:19,3
the register a receipt.


7
0:0:19,3 --> 0:0:20,53
ALEJANDRA GAITAN: It's
just really, really--


8
0:0:20,53 --> 0:0:21,399
MEGAN LEE HEART: --cute.


9
0:0:21,399 --> 0:0:25,53
FEMALE SPEAKER 2: So,
anyways, yeah.


10
0:0:25,53 --> 0:0:27,5
TIM SAVAGE: There's a trend
happening on YouTube right now


11
0:0:27,5 --> 0:0:29,93
which, basically, is just a
bunch of fat-titty girls


12
0:0:29,93 --> 0:0:33,16
making stupid-ass reply videos
to everything that comes out.


13
0:0:33,16 --> 0:0:34,6
MALE SPEAKER 1: They're
flipping everywhere.


14
0:0:34,6 --> 0:0:37,21
Even on this video, because it's
about reply girls, there


15
0:0:37,21 --> 0:0:40,31
will be about five down here
to the left of me.


16
0:0:40,31 --> 0:0:41,58
You look down at the related
videos, there will probably be


17
0:0:41,58 --> 0:0:42,53
some reply girls there.


18
0:0:42,53 --> 0:0:44,17
THE LUCHADOR: They
do shitty videos.


19
0:0:44,17 --> 0:0:46,69
They're completely terrible.


20
0:0:46,69 --> 0:0:48,81
TIM SAVAGE: Just these girls
yapping nonsense for long


21
0:0:48,81 --> 0:0:51,17
enough to fit an ad in so
they can make money.


22
0:0:51,17 --> 0:0:53,609
THE LUCHADOR: People take hours,
and hours, and hours to


23
0:0:53,609 --> 0:0:56,1
produce a quality video
and original content.


24
0:0:56,1 --> 0:1:0,38
And they just pretty much watch
it, reply, and they get


25
0:1:0,38 --> 0:1:3,27
100 times what I would get
in views-- and like this.


26
0:1:3,27 --> 0:1:6,47
MALE SPEAKER 1: The end result
is almost painful to watch.


27
0:1:6,47 --> 0:1:7,84
MALE SPEAKER 2: Oh, hey guys.


28
0:1:7,84 --> 0:1:10,4
MALE SPEAKER 3: Oh,
it made me so hot.


29
0:1:10,4 --> 0:1:11,65
MALE SPEAKER 4:
[SPEAKING GERMAN]


30
0:1:11,65 --> 0:1:14,16



31
0:1:14,16 --> 0:1:17,2
ADOLF HITLER: [SPEAKING GERMAN]


32
0:1:17,2 --> 0:1:18,39
ALEJANDRA GAITAN: Peace and
love, guys, see you.


33
0:1:18,39 --> 0:1:20,55
Thank you very much
for watching, bye.


34
0:1:20,55 --> 0:1:28,47



35
0:1:28,47 --> 0:1:33,95
Now, in case you don't me, I
am the Reply Girl, probably


36
0:1:33,95 --> 0:1:38,78
one of YouTube's most hated
personalities right now.


37
0:1:38,78 --> 0:1:41,44
[SPANISH]


38
0:1:41,44 --> 0:1:45,4
When I started YouTube-ing, I
was below the poverty line,


39
0:1:45,4 --> 0:1:50,12
and I really, really, really
needed a way to get out of


40
0:1:50,12 --> 0:1:51,733
that situation.


41
0:1:51,733 --> 0:1:52,48
Hi guys.


42
0:1:52,48 --> 0:1:56,1
My first month, I made enough
to pay a cellphone bill.


43
0:1:56,1 --> 0:1:57,96
And I worked so much.


44
0:1:57,96 --> 0:2:0,14
Well, it's very simple.


45
0:2:0,14 --> 0:2:2,9
You go on YouTube and
you look for the


46
0:2:2,9 --> 0:2:4,91
videos that are trending.


47
0:2:4,91 --> 0:2:9,6
I like those that are, like,
random and funny.


48
0:2:9,6 --> 0:2:11,335
Good morning, Senor Luchador.


49
0:2:11,335 --> 0:2:15,2
I brought you breakfast with
lots of lots of bacon.


50
0:2:15,2 --> 0:2:18,2
[SCREAM]


51
0:2:18,2 --> 0:2:20,98
THE LUCHADOR: Alejandra, well,
to be honest, she is my


52
0:2:20,98 --> 0:2:22,3
girlfriend's sister.


53
0:2:22,3 --> 0:2:25,3
And [INAUDIBLE] she's
my YouTube mentor.


54
0:2:25,3 --> 0:2:26,63
And we can offer that service.


55
0:2:26,63 --> 0:2:30,545
[INAUDIBLE] service of having a
studio with a green screen,


56
0:2:30,545 --> 0:2:31,8
and having like interns.


57
0:2:31,8 --> 0:2:33,46
ALEJANDRA GAITAN: Well, the
thing is that-- what you're


58
0:2:33,46 --> 0:2:35,86
putting at stake is your
skills and your time.


59
0:2:35,86 --> 0:2:37,49
What I'm putting in stakes
is my money.


60
0:2:37,49 --> 0:2:39,39
So if it doesn't
work, OK, fine.


61
0:2:39,39 --> 0:2:40,59
You wasted your time.


62
0:2:40,59 --> 0:2:44,7
But me, my money's going to be
gone, and I'll be screwed.


63
0:2:44,7 --> 0:2:48,2
THE LUCHADOR: Alejandra actually
pretty much convinced


64
0:2:48,2 --> 0:2:50,566
me to start making videos
on YouTube.


65
0:2:50,566 --> 0:2:51,77
ALEJANDRA GAITAN: Hey
guys, I just saw--


66
0:2:51,77 --> 0:2:52,75
THE LUCHADOR: Reply
Girl, Reply Girl.


67
0:2:52,75 --> 0:2:53,88
I need some advice.


68
0:2:53,88 --> 0:2:55,34
Haters are trying to get at
me, and you know what?


69
0:2:55,34 --> 0:2:58,168
I've got to go break their
necks one by one.


70
0:2:58,168 --> 0:3:0,32
[GRUNT]


71
0:3:0,32 --> 0:3:3,86
Well, what happened was that
she showed me her check.


72
0:3:3,86 --> 0:3:5,41
And it was a nice check.


73
0:3:5,41 --> 0:3:8,67
For what she does, it was a
very, very beautiful check.


74
0:3:8,67 --> 0:3:12,5
ALEJANDRA GAITAN: I always
wanted to be an autonomous


75
0:3:12,5 --> 0:3:18,5
worker, or have a company,
or make money on my


76
0:3:18,5 --> 0:3:21,19
own, be my own boss.


77
0:3:21,19 --> 0:3:26,38
And I just never knew what,
exactly, I wanted to do to


78
0:3:26,38 --> 0:3:27,32
make it happen.


79
0:3:27,32 --> 0:3:31,4
I just knew I want
it to happen.


80
0:3:31,4 --> 0:3:33,38
I studied programming.


81
0:3:33,38 --> 0:3:39,65
But it didn't work out very well
because I'm not a very


82
0:3:39,65 --> 0:3:41,35
good programmer.


83
0:3:41,35 --> 0:3:44,97
And yeah, I also did
some babysitting.


84
0:3:44,97 --> 0:3:47,9
But that's about it.


85
0:3:47,9 --> 0:3:49,96
THE LUCHADOR: I tried doing
replies myself.


86
0:3:49,96 --> 0:3:52,9
And believe it or not, it's
a harder job than


87
0:3:52,9 --> 0:3:54,22
you think it is.


88
0:3:54,22 --> 0:3:54,83
It's long.


89
0:3:54,83 --> 0:3:58,6
It's boring, tedious,
it's annoying.


90
0:3:58,6 --> 0:3:59,87
I mean, it's not a fun job.


91
0:3:59,87 --> 0:4:3,14
And the haters, people out there
who are hating on reply


92
0:4:3,14 --> 0:4:5,2
people, and, like, oh you
know, what they do is


93
0:4:5,2 --> 0:4:6,29
brainless--


94
0:4:6,29 --> 0:4:6,66
you know what?


95
0:4:6,66 --> 0:4:7,35
Do it yourself.


96
0:4:7,35 --> 0:4:9,47
If you don't like it, don't
do it and don't watch it.


97
0:4:9,47 --> 0:4:11,71
Simple as that.


98
0:4:11,71 --> 0:4:15,68
First times that these haters--
they're posting


99
0:4:15,68 --> 0:4:18,339
videos and threads about finding
her address, her IP


100
0:4:18,339 --> 0:4:19,85
address, and knowing
where she lives.


101
0:4:19,85 --> 0:4:22,0
I've seen posts on
YouTube, people


102
0:4:22,0 --> 0:4:24,14
actually posting an address.


103
0:4:24,14 --> 0:4:25,73
They thought that they found her
address, and they posted


104
0:4:25,73 --> 0:4:27,3
it everywhere.


105
0:4:27,3 --> 0:4:32,86
What kind of a bad person are
you to take a hated person's


106
0:4:32,86 --> 0:4:34,85
address and post it
to the public?


107
0:4:34,85 --> 0:4:39,11
So some crazy person comes over
and sees the address and


108
0:4:39,11 --> 0:4:41,1
does something that they're
going to regret


109
0:4:41,1 --> 0:4:41,94
later on, you know?


110
0:4:41,94 --> 0:4:43,93
Oh Jesus.


111
0:4:43,93 --> 0:4:45,66
If only they knew.


112
0:4:45,66 --> 0:4:46,76
I'm waiting.


113
0:4:46,76 --> 0:4:48,37
ALEJANDRA GAITAN: Like, I mean,
I know you are going to


114
0:4:48,37 --> 0:4:52,79
interview Megan, but you
shouldn't do it because she


115
0:4:52,79 --> 0:4:56,11
has tried to destroy me and to
destroy everybody else that


116
0:4:56,11 --> 0:4:59,6
has done replies.


117
0:4:59,6 --> 0:5:3,12
MEGAN LEE HEART: Look, the
Reply Girl, Alejandra--


118
0:5:3,12 --> 0:5:4,25
shut up.


119
0:5:4,25 --> 0:5:4,94
Drop it.


120
0:5:4,94 --> 0:5:6,87
It's getting out of hand.


121
0:5:6,87 --> 0:5:9,49
THE LUCHADOR: Megan understood
that Alejandra and all the


122
0:5:9,49 --> 0:5:11,18
other reply people
are competition.


123
0:5:11,18 --> 0:5:14,3
So the way to get them off
YouTube is to threaten them,


124
0:5:14,3 --> 0:5:16,715
send death letters, try to hack
them, try to find their


125
0:5:16,715 --> 0:5:20,6
address to go and send people
to do things, which is


126
0:5:20,6 --> 0:5:23,13
completely unethical.


127
0:5:23,13 --> 0:5:25,2
ALEJANDRA GAITAN: They leave all
sorts of comments, like,


128
0:5:25,2 --> 0:5:26,28
I'm going to rape you.


129
0:5:26,28 --> 0:5:29,805
We're going to go to your house
and slit your throat.


130
0:5:29,805 --> 0:5:30,25
THE LUCHADOR: Vicious.


131
0:5:30,25 --> 0:5:33,33
When you talk about,
feline, cat crazy--


132
0:5:33,33 --> 0:5:36,41
vicious, you've got that side.


133
0:5:36,41 --> 0:5:38,8
ALEJANDRA GAITAN: What's
this expression--


134
0:5:38,8 --> 0:5:41,48
a dog that barks too much
but that doesn't bite?


135
0:5:41,48 --> 0:5:43,21
TIM SAVAGE: Now a couple of
weeks ago I had a video about


136
0:5:43,21 --> 0:5:44,2
the reply girls.


137
0:5:44,2 --> 0:5:48,5
And the craziest thing to me was
they could not understand


138
0:5:48,5 --> 0:5:50,15
how someone could watch their
videos and think that they


139
0:5:50,15 --> 0:5:52,19
were stupid and annoying.


140
0:5:52,19 --> 0:5:55,19
For those that are initiated
with the character, and what


141
0:5:55,19 --> 0:5:57,53
I'm trying to do with satire
of white trash America, and


142
0:5:57,53 --> 0:6:0,5
that kind of thing-- probably
1 out of every 10 comments


143
0:6:0,5 --> 0:6:4,225
that I get personally is, I'm
going to fucking kill you.


144
0:6:4,225 --> 0:6:8,9
When I worked in radio, I had a
couple of hate calls a week.


145
0:6:8,9 --> 0:6:12,7
But online, I get a couple of
hate comments a second--


146
0:6:12,7 --> 0:6:12,94
every second.


147
0:6:12,94 --> 0:6:16,43
The anonymity of the internet
gives people that feeling of


148
0:6:16,43 --> 0:6:19,16
power that they can do
whatever they want.


149
0:6:19,16 --> 0:6:21,95
And they don't understand
the responsibility.


150
0:6:21,95 --> 0:6:23,745
I understand, she's just
somebody that's trying to make


151
0:6:23,745 --> 0:6:24,31
it, you know?


152
0:6:24,31 --> 0:6:26,15
Not even make it, but,
like, make it by--


153
0:6:26,15 --> 0:6:27,81
And, of course, a little
bit of attention.


154
0:6:27,81 --> 0:6:29,55
Who doesn't like attention.


155
0:6:29,55 --> 0:6:33,25
ALEJANDRA GAITAN: So this is
a video of me modelling.


156
0:6:33,25 --> 0:6:36,2
Look, let's be honest here--


157
0:6:36,2 --> 0:6:40,96
that's just the way, sorry
to say it, male brain in


158
0:6:40,96 --> 0:6:44,43
particular interprets
certain images.


159
0:6:44,43 --> 0:6:46,79
One cannot deny it--


160
0:6:46,79 --> 0:6:52,45
sex appeal, it's a winner.


161
0:6:52,45 --> 0:6:54,62
I don't think it can
open, actually.


162
0:6:54,62 --> 0:6:55,63
No it doesn't open.


163
0:6:55,63 --> 0:6:58,52
If I was earning good money,
I would move out.


164
0:6:58,52 --> 0:7:3,9
But since I can't, I'd rather
stay here in safety.


165
0:7:3,9 --> 0:7:6,41
I actually have lots
of clothes.


166
0:7:6,41 --> 0:7:7,63
It's amazing.


167
0:7:7,63 --> 0:7:11,19
Due to the fact that I'm living
in this house, I can


168
0:7:11,19 --> 0:7:15,88
only wear certain types of
shirts, even if I do have a


169
0:7:15,88 --> 0:7:17,6
lot of clothing.


170
0:7:17,6 --> 0:7:21,1
Let's just say family
conflicts.


171
0:7:21,1 --> 0:7:22,41
They're too sexy.


172
0:7:22,41 --> 0:7:29,6



173
0:7:29,6 --> 0:7:32,8
ALEJANDRA GAITAN: I can see
it bothers her a lot.


174
0:7:32,8 --> 0:7:38,34
She expected us to follow the
traditional way and to, what


175
0:7:38,34 --> 0:7:47,89
can I say, get a job, work all
of your life, and then, at the


176
0:7:47,89 --> 0:7:52,37
end of your life, when you are,
like, useless, retire.


177
0:7:52,37 --> 0:7:54,6
Whose happiness is
more important?


178
0:7:54,6 --> 0:7:57,6
I pick mine over hers.


179
0:7:57,6 --> 0:8:1,79
My father is back in Latin
America because we were about


180
0:8:1,79 --> 0:8:5,1
to immigrate, and he kind
of just hooked up


181
0:8:5,1 --> 0:8:5,9
with another girl.


182
0:8:5,9 --> 0:8:7,652
So--


183
0:8:7,652 --> 0:8:12,113
At the beginning, we used to
talk like once a month.


184
0:8:12,113 --> 0:8:16,91
But as years passed by, I think
it was, like, twice a


185
0:8:16,91 --> 0:8:19,1
year, and then it
was once a year.


186
0:8:19,1 --> 0:8:22,5
And it's been like six to eight
months since I don't


187
0:8:22,5 --> 0:8:23,75
talk to him, so--


188
0:8:23,75 --> 0:8:28,11



189
0:8:28,11 --> 0:8:30,7
THE LUCHADOR: Her traffic
went completely shut.


190
0:8:30,7 --> 0:8:31,765
It went down like crazy.


191
0:8:31,765 --> 0:8:34,429
The way that the YouTube
algorithm is


192
0:8:34,429 --> 0:8:37,37
changing her business--


193
0:8:37,37 --> 0:8:39,12
also changing everyone's.


194
0:8:39,12 --> 0:8:41,159
ALEJANDRA GAITAN: One day,
without warning, I saw this--


195
0:8:41,159 --> 0:8:42,1
poof.


196
0:8:42,1 --> 0:8:45,959
And I was, like, Jesus,
Lord, mercy.


197
0:8:45,959 --> 0:8:49,54
What am I going to do now?


198
0:8:49,54 --> 0:8:52,82
I plan to keep on YouTube-ing.


199
0:8:52,82 --> 0:9:0,17
And in the future, I'm not
really sure what I would do.


200
0:9:0,17 --> 0:9:2,53
Oy.


201
0:9:2,53 --> 0:9:4,32
Hello, Pollux.


202
0:9:4,32 --> 0:9:8,32
You know what's funny, people
think that I'm this party


203
0:9:8,32 --> 0:9:12,65
animal, that I go out and
have fun and enjoy and


204
0:9:12,65 --> 0:9:14,34
do this and do that.


205
0:9:14,34 --> 0:9:17,85
But no, in reality I'm
a very lonely person.


206
0:9:17,85 --> 0:9:19,71
And I like to stay in my room.


207
0:9:19,71 --> 0:9:22,5
I almost never go out.


208
0:9:22,5 --> 0:9:25,3
And I'm just OK here,
in my house.


209
0:9:25,3 --> 0:9:28,504



210
0:9:28,504 --> 0:9:29,436
Kind of--


211
0:9:29,436 --> 0:9:31,3
I don't know.


212
0:9:31,3 --> 0:9:35,46
I wonder if it would have been
better if he had just, if we


213
0:9:35,46 --> 0:9:37,89
would have just broke.


214
0:9:37,89 --> 0:9:41,19
But you never expect your
boyfriend to die and to die in


215
0:9:41,19 --> 0:9:43,27
such a way.


216
0:9:43,27 --> 0:9:45,24
He was a kind man.


217
0:9:45,24 --> 0:9:48,15
He was a kind man, sir.


218
0:9:48,15 --> 0:9:51,0
He was a good boy.


219
0:9:51,0 --> 0:10:3,42
And well, I don't know if I'll
look for somebody, or if I'll


220
0:10:3,42 --> 0:10:5,23
just stay alone, you know?


221
0:10:5,23 --> 0:12:5,23
