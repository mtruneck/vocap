Me and my uncle here, Guam

0:2:48,18 --> 0:2:50,81
to Mexico without
our passports.


36
0:2:50,81 --> 0:2:55,34
So we tried to cross over, and
because of his anonymous


37
0:2:55,34 --> 0:3:0,45
racial makeup, you can't
tell if he's Mexican.

the pharmacia.

We bought testosterone.

they have.

testosterone into our veins to

A lot of people think The Thing
from the Fantastic Four


124
0:7:9,47 --> 0:7:11,86
is stronger than the Incredible
Hulk, because he's


125
0:7:11,86 --> 0:7:13,66
made out of orange rocks
and is harder.


126
0:7:13,66 --> 0:7:16,67
Truth is, the Incredible Hulk
can hold his breath for about


127
0:7:16,67 --> 0:7:18,3
two hours longer
than The Thing.


128
0:7:18,3 --> 0:7:21,52
So if they were to ever fight,
all the Hulk would have to do


129
0:7:21,52 --> 0:7:23,68
is grab him and then jump--


130
0:7:23,68 --> 0:7:26,58
The Hulk can jump, I think,
one mile radius-- and jump


131
0:7:26,58 --> 0:7:28,85
into outer space, and just
hold his breath until The


132
0:7:28,85 --> 0:7:30,57
Thing explodes from
the inside out.


133
0:7:30,57 --> 0:7:33,2
Or, do the same thing, jumping
into the water.

0:8:46,18 --> 0:8:49,66
She wanted to say goodbye and
goodnight to you guys, but she


159
0:8:49,66 --> 0:8:51,6

went to sleep.

0:9:57,53 --> 0:9:59,33

177
0:9:59,33 --> 0:10:3,46
We're a little bit outside of
Los Angeles, California.


178
0:10:3,46 --> 0:10:6,87
I think we're in Valencia
or Saugus.


179
0:10:6,87 --> 0:10:10,86

181
0:10:12,67 --> 0:10:17,18

yesterday, we're traveling

the last state.

0:10:22,36 --> 0:10:23,21
Harry's been everywhere.


184
0:10:23,21 --> 0:10:27,17
But for me, personally, I've
never been to Alaska before.


185
0:10:27,17 --> 0:10:28,87
And Alaska--


186
0:10:28,87 --> 0:10:29,92
it's the last.


187
0:10:29,92 --> 0:10:31,94
It's just the last place.


188
0:10:31,94 --> 0:10:36,74
There's Eskimos and vampires,
and Eskimo vampires, and


189
0:10:36,74 --> 0:10:39,0
Eskimo kisses and all
sorts of goodness.


190
0:10:39,0 --> 0:10:42,16

of great shit out there.


191
0:10:42,16 --> 0:10:44,98

been to, and I'm looking


192
0:10:44,98 --> 0:10:46,23
forward to it.

196
0:10:53,64 --> 0:10:55,8
Any ride.


197
0:10:55,8 --> 0:10:59,74
We got off in the middle of
the night and have been


198
0:10:59,74 --> 0:11:0,7
walking these train tracks.


199
0:11:0,7 --> 0:11:3,275
Nothing's been coming
by for a little bit.


200
0:11:3,275 --> 0:11:4,41
The day's just begun.


201
0:11:4,41 --> 0:11:7,54
We'll either catch a ride
on a train or a car.


202
0:11:7,54 --> 0:11:9,8

203

exit, maybe


211

0:11:50,569 --> 0:11:52,565
We need a sign, dude.

0:12:17,7 --> 0:12:20,711
To Bakersfield?

0:12:20,711 --> 0:12:22,46
Thumbs up, America.

0:12:22,46 --> 0:12:23,88
We just got our first ride.

0:12:23,88 --> 0:12:25,776
Bumping the Mexican jams.

We're heading to Bakersfield,

DAVID CHOE: Arturo?

0:12:49,218 --> 0:12:50,468
Gracias, Arturo.

Adios!


235
0:13:1,322 --> 0:13:6,12
All in all, not a very
eventful ride.


236

Arturo played us his jams.

0:13:12,83 --> 0:13:14,31
Arturo wasn't very talkative.

Our first ride that I've ever
gotten from a guy who doesn't

0:13:17,56 --> 0:13:19,8
speak English.


241
0:13:19,8 --> 0:13:20,89
And we were in fucking Mexico.

0:13:20,89 --> 0:13:22,786
We were in his country
yesterday.


243
0:13:22,786 --> 0:13:24,35
And he picked us up in
our country, today.

get a ride into Fresno.

POLICE OFFICER: You
can't be up here.

There's signs right down here
that say no pedestrians.

0:13:57,6 --> 0:13:59,736
That's as far as you can go.

The problem with finding the
right car is all these

0:14:24,98 --> 0:14:26,27
There's no place to
place to sit.


268
0:14:26,27 --> 0:14:28,18
I mean, I guess we could sit on
this part, but then we got


269
0:14:28,18 --> 0:14:28,81
to balance.

0:14:28,81 --> 0:14:31,39

to take your legs off.

on the tracks.

just filming a--

with the yard office before


280
0:14:50,525 --> 0:14:50,99
you did that?


281
0:14:50,99 --> 0:14:52,43
DAVID CHOE: Oh, I'm sorry.


282
0:14:52,43 --> 0:14:54,17

idea to do that.

284
0:14:54,79 --> 0:14:56,17

all the way down there.

0:14:56,17 --> 0:14:57,74
See where those headlights
are down there?


286
0:14:57,74 --> 0:14:58,17
The train headlights?


287
0:14:58,17 --> 0:14:58,5
DAVID CHOE: Right.

0:14:58,5 --> 0:14:59,6

where it is.

DAVID CHOE: Oh, boy.


290
0:14:59,84 --> 0:15:1,89
MALE SPEAKER: So you should
have done that.


291
0:15:1,89 --> 0:15:5,59
Because we've got security
running around here and they


292
0:15:5,59 --> 0:15:7,11
might get the wrong idea.

0:15:7,11 --> 0:15:8,43

going to walk up


294

you stay away from the tracks,


296
0:15:13,6 --> 0:15:13,915
stay on this road.

0:15:14,58 --> 0:15:16,36

between cars, because


299

these trains are going to
move at any minute.

freeway underpass.

moving, we'll jump on.

I believe we're in
downtown Fresno.


311
0:15:59,25 --> 0:16:1,6
We just got off the train
tracks, here.


312
0:16:1,6 --> 0:16:3,38

0:16:3,38 --> 0:16:5,2
There's like nothing going on.

0:16:5,2 --> 0:16:8,84
There's the 99 freeway, right
there, I believe.

We're just trying to figure out
what we should do tonight.

and entering.

behind us might look like our

to steal anything.

and not get ass

0:17:34,565 --> 0:17:36,38
This is fucking gross, man.

344
0:17:41,439 --> 0:17:43,41
Look!


345
0:17:43,41 --> 0:17:45,87
This is my favorite part,
trying to translate.


346
0:17:45,87 --> 0:17:46,98
I'm not an expert, or anything,


347
0:17:46,98 --> 0:17:48,92
but I'll try my best.


348
0:17:48,92 --> 0:17:51,39
First, we have the classic
reefer joint.


349
0:17:51,39 --> 0:17:55,94
Now, I know that there's
daywalkers and vampires in


350
0:17:55,94 --> 0:17:58,87
Alaska, but I didn't know that
they were in Fresno.


351
0:17:58,87 --> 0:18:1,54
Or as Harry likes to call
it, Fres-natch.


352
0:18:1,54 --> 0:18:3,73
So this is a very good sign.


353
0:18:3,73 --> 0:18:5,71
I don't if your light's going
to be able to pick this up,


354
0:18:5,71 --> 0:18:7,71
because it's red on red.


355
0:18:7,71 --> 0:18:11,1
You can see the new red
over the old red.


356
0:18:11,1 --> 0:18:12,79
And what the old red was--


357
0:18:12,79 --> 0:18:15,28
I'll just do the fast outline.


358
0:18:15,28 --> 0:18:17,43
So that's the new outline.


359
0:18:17,43 --> 0:18:20,2
There's actually something else
going on over here, which


360
0:18:20,2 --> 0:18:22,53
I'll try to duplicate, also.


361
0:18:22,53 --> 0:18:25,982
What is that?


362
0:18:25,982 --> 0:18:27,6
Oh my god.


363
0:18:27,6 --> 0:18:29,845
I just drew pornography.


364
0:18:29,845 --> 0:18:31,24
All right, I don't want
to fuck with that.


365
0:18:31,24 --> 0:18:34,3
Oh my god, the foreshortening
here is fucking unbelievable.


366
0:18:34,3 --> 0:18:40,57
This must be from the sexually
frustrated, prepubescent, to


367
0:18:40,57 --> 0:18:43,44
pubescent, to early 20s teen.


368
0:18:43,44 --> 0:18:46,7
And there's actually a lot of
little subtleties going on.


369
0:18:46,7 --> 0:18:49,3
Because this person doesn't know
how to draw hands, and


370
0:18:49,3 --> 0:18:50,61
they don't know how
to draw feet.


371
0:18:50,61 --> 0:18:54,21
And they just drew a slit for
where the vagina would be.


372
0:18:54,21 --> 0:18:59,19
But as you can see, what
happened here was, after they


373
0:18:59,19 --> 0:19:3,49
drew this filth, this
porn, on the wall--


374
0:19:3,49 --> 0:19:6,48
either that artist, or someone
else that came up here,


375
0:19:6,48 --> 0:19:9,7
started stabbing or punching
this woman's vagina.


376
0:19:9,7 --> 0:19:13,24
As if someone was like, pining
over some girl that said to


377
0:19:13,24 --> 0:19:15,14
him, I just want to be
friends with you.


378
0:19:15,14 --> 0:19:19,8
And he came up here, and
he went, [GRUNTING]

0:19:19,833 --> 0:19:21,63
Fuck your pussy!


381
0:19:21,63 --> 0:19:22,97
It's like something
that happened.


382
0:19:22,97 --> 0:19:24,94
So let me try to bring this
out a little bit.


383
0:19:24,94 --> 0:19:27,6



384
0:19:27,6 --> 0:19:30,34
This is the drawing that
was once here.


385
0:19:30,34 --> 0:19:33,622
So we have a naked woman,

heavens as if--

DAVID CHOE: We got this dude,
and vampires, sex, drugs.


391
0:19:52,54 --> 0:19:56,625
I mean it is one of the
best hall of fame


392
0:19:56,625 --> 0:19:58,2
graffiti murals I've seen.


393
0:19:58,2 --> 0:19:59,53
And the only thing missing
from it is, of


394
0:19:59,53 --> 0:20:0,78
course, Harry Kim.


395
0:20:0,78 --> 0:20:15,57

0:20:15,57 --> 0:20:17,548
That looks exactly like you.


397

Make the face, dude.


398
0:20:18,546 --> 0:20:19,796
Chink it up.


399

400
0:20:31,52 --> 0:20:33,3
Oh shit.

There's lights coming on.
