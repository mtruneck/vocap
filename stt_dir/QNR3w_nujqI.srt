1
0:0:0,1 --> 0:0:4,7
new world.


2
0:0:4,7 --> 0:0:11,889
Their job is to make money for the British trading companies that sent them here.


3
0:0:11,889 --> 0:0:17,4
The land they seize seems to be the right place to exploit.


4
0:0:17,4 --> 0:0:24,909
Forests and rivers, coasts and lakes owned by no one.


5
0:0:24,909 --> 0:0:29,789
But not all native Americans succumbed to European diseases.


6
0:0:29,789 --> 0:0:33,59
And this land is neither empty


7
0:0:33,59 --> 0:0:38,57
 nor uninhabited.


8
0:0:38,57 --> 0:0:44,23
It is the land of the Powhatan, more than fourteen thousand people living in


9
0:0:44,23 --> 0:0:45,97
small communities,


10
0:0:45,97 --> 0:0:49,489
around two hundred villages on the coast and along rivers,


11
0:0:49,489 --> 0:0:55,309
in large houses surrounded by cleared forests and mixed fields of squash, beans


12
0:0:55,309 --> 0:0:57,4
and corn.


13
0:0:57,4 --> 0:1:6,86
These are farmers and hunters.


14
0:1:6,86 --> 0:1:7,99
There is no gold,


15
0:1:7,99 --> 0:1:12,23
no silver, that settlers dreamed of.


16
0:1:12,23 --> 0:1:39,68
Just the land and its people.


17
0:1:39,68 --> 0:1:40,78
For a while


18
0:1:40,78 --> 0:2:13,569
the settlers and the natives managed to co-exist.


19
0:2:13,569 --> 0:2:22,149
This land is rich with resources that Europe lacks.


20
0:2:22,149 --> 0:2:23,159
In the long run


21
0:2:23,159 --> 0:2:35,359
resources that are far more valuable than gold and silver.


22
0:2:35,359 --> 0:2:44,819
And there's more than enough for everyone.


23
0:2:44,819 --> 0:2:49,276
Europeans wanted to travel west to the great empires of Asia.


24
0:2:49,276 --> 0:2:53,309
Instead the new world they find amazes them


25
0:2:53,309 --> 0:3:0,339
with its natural abundance.


26
0:3:0,339 --> 0:3:6,149
They discovered almost miraculous unbelievable quantities of fish in these estuaries and rivers.


27
0:3:6,149 --> 0:3:8,849
One particular kind of fish which


28
0:3:8,849 --> 0:3:10,779
very much impressed settlers


29
0:3:10,779 --> 0:3:15,409
was the river herring or alewife as it's otherwise called,


30
0:3:15,409 --> 0:3:19,19
and seasonally these would ascend the rivers to spawn from the sea


31
0:3:19,19 --> 0:3:20,429
in their millions.


32
0:3:20,429 --> 0:3:22,839
For example in the Potomac river,


33
0:3:22,839 --> 0:3:25,439
near Washington DC,


34
0:3:25,439 --> 0:3:29,179
during the eighteenth century, something like seven hundred and fifty


35
0:3:29,179 --> 0:3:33,749
million alewife were caught, just from that one river in one year.


36
0:3:33,749 --> 0:3:37,29
It was a remarkable abundance and people


37
0:3:37,29 --> 0:3:41,849
described the rivers as having more fish than water.


38
0:3:41,849 --> 0:3:45,419
Whole shoals are caught in the settlers' nets.


39
0:3:45,419 --> 0:3:46,699
In the eighteenth century


40
0:3:46,699 --> 0:3:49,29
hundreds of thousands of tons are caught


41
0:3:49,29 --> 0:3:54,509
and shipped in one single year and sent from North America to England,


42
0:3:54,509 --> 0:3:56,319
Portugal and Spain.


43
0:3:56,319 --> 0:3:59,529
Fishing boats sink under the weight of their captures,


44
0:3:59,529 --> 0:4:2,709
and the colonies thrive.


45
0:4:2,709 --> 0:4:7,139
It takes only two hundred years to achieve what had taken a thousand years


46
0:4:7,139 --> 0:4:8,959
in Europe.


47
0:4:8,959 --> 0:4:10,839
Overfishing.


48
0:4:10,839 --> 0:4:15,349
Fishing tends to remove the biggest oldest individuals from the population,


49
0:4:15,349 --> 0:4:16,91
and by doing this,


50
0:4:16,91 --> 0:4:20,21
it changes the selected pressures on the population


51
0:4:20,21 --> 0:4:22,559
so that fish begin to


52
0:4:22,559 --> 0:4:24,8
grow more slowly


53
0:4:24,8 --> 0:4:29,509
they reach reproductive maturity at a smaller size and earlier in life.


54
0:4:29,509 --> 0:4:40,15
And these things all reduce the productivity of a population.


55
0:4:40,15 --> 0:4:51,479
Fish are salted, hacked and sent home for money.


56
0:4:51,479 --> 0:5:2,86
Along with them the settlers send another resource that the old world is desperate for.


57
0:5:2,86 --> 0:5:7,41
It is said that there are trees as far as the eye can see.


58
0:5:7,41 --> 0:5:10,68
Such that a squirrel starting off at the Atlantic coast


59
0:5:10,68 --> 0:5:12,38
need never touch the ground


60
0:5:12,38 --> 0:5:15,55
to ** to Georgia.


61
0:5:15,55 --> 0:5:18,809
This is so different from the Europe they left behind.


62
0:5:18,809 --> 0:5:24,119
They have finally found a replacement for something that is disappearing at home.


63
0:5:24,119 --> 0:5:32,908
An infinite accessible source of the raw material of the age.


64
0:5:32,908 --> 0:5:45,9
The forests must fall if the settlers are to succeed.


65
0:5:45,9 --> 0:5:46,36
From now on


66
0:5:46,36 --> 0:5:51,229
the trees are doomed.


67
0:5:51,229 --> 0:5:54,879
When the first settlers arrived in the new world


68
0:5:54,879 --> 0:5:57,78
they found forests that they had never seen in Europe.


69
0:5:57,78 --> 0:6:2,729
Endless forests with huge trees penetrating into the heart of the land


70
0:6:2,729 --> 0:6:7,331
was also a woe against the forest. The ax became the yankee emblem.


71
0:6:7,331 --> 0:6:12,939
At the same time forests would degrade resources that the land had to offer.


72
0:6:12,939 --> 0:6:16,43
You could make plenty of money exporting timber in Europe would have become expensive


73
0:6:16,43 --> 0:6:27,37
and so the greatest forest destruction in history now took place.


74
0:6:27,37 --> 0:6:31,63
The clearing of forests that seemed to belong to no one and cost nothing


75
0:6:31,63 --> 0:6:36,71
goes so far that by the late seventeenth century many areas of the Caribbean and


76
0:6:36,71 --> 0:6:56,37
the Atlantic islands are completely bald.


77
0:6:56,37 --> 0:6:58,219
An incredible amount of wood


78
0:6:58,219 --> 0:7:1,249
is really squandered in this country for fuel.


79
0:7:1,249 --> 0:7:8,59
"Day and night, all winter for nearly half a year in all rooms a fire is kept going"


80
0:7:8,59 --> 0:7:11,689
observes a European traveller.


81
0:7:11,689 --> 0:7:14,499
Wood consumption in the forests of New England


82
0:7:14,499 --> 0:7:15,809
just like in Europe,


83
0:7:15,809 --> 0:7:18,279
is out of control.


84
0:7:18,279 --> 0:7:22,65
For fuel, for building and to clear agricultural land.


85
0:7:22,65 --> 0:7:25,12
The resources in this vast continent


86
0:7:25,12 --> 0:7:27,61
seem to be inexhaustible,


87
0:7:27,61 --> 0:7:28,85
but in time


88
0:7:28,85 --> 0:7:33,989
fish stocks will dwindle in the Americas too.


89
0:7:33,989 --> 0:7:36,349
They create this new world


90
0:7:36,349 --> 0:7:47,22
in the image of the one they left.


91
0:7:47,22 --> 0:7:51,149
Europeans change America by what they take away


92
0:7:51,149 --> 0:7:54,25
but they change this continent even more


93
0:7:54,25 --> 0:8:6,9
by what they bring with them.


94
0:8:6,9 --> 0:8:8,759
They come in search of their own land,


95
0:8:8,759 --> 0:8:13,249
something almost impossible to find in Europe.


96
0:8:13,249 --> 0:8:15,66
They come in search of religious freedom,


97
0:8:15,66 --> 0:8:18,15
in search of a better life.


98
0:8:18,15 --> 0:8:21,28
They believe they are responsible for their own success


99
0:8:21,28 --> 0:8:24,5
and happiness.


100
0:8:24,5 --> 0:8:38,47
For the first time women settlers come too, and they bring the whole way of life with them.


101
0:8:38,47 --> 0:8:40,43
They bring animals and plants


102
0:8:40,43 --> 0:9:10,51
that are all new to the American continent.


103
0:9:10,51 --> 0:9:28,43
Livestock and grains from Europe will transform the new world and make it a true New England.


104
0:9:28,43 --> 0:9:30,58
With the newly imported plough


105
0:9:30,58 --> 0:9:36,85
they will leave little land untilled.


106
0:9:36,85 --> 0:9:43,7
This domesticated livestock and little tools have never been seen on this continent.


107
0:9:43,7 --> 0:9:48,25
An environmental revolution takes place.


108
0:9:48,25 --> 0:9:49,5
In no time


109
0:9:49,5 --> 0:9:51,58
their European wheat is growing


110
0:9:51,58 --> 0:9:55,31
in this foreign soil.


111
0:9:55,31 --> 0:10:0,67
Wheat, barley, oats and rye are brought to America.


112
0:10:0,67 --> 0:10:10,44
But in the process some less welcome guests **


113
0:10:10,44 --> 0:10:11,94
Europeans introduced


114
0:10:11,94 --> 0:10:15,83
crops such as wheat to the Americas, but in the bags of seed they brought with them


115
0:10:15,83 --> 0:10:20,5
them to the Americas they also brought along seeds for weeds


116
0:10:20,5 --> 0:10:21,57
dandelions,


117
0:10:21,57 --> 0:10:27,7
other kinds of weeds and these are everywhere in the Americas now.


118
0:10:27,7 --> 0:10:29,799
From the most insignificant weed


119
0:10:29,799 --> 0:10:32,76
to the continent's greatest mammal, the bison,


120
0:10:32,76 --> 0:10:37,34
nothing is untouched.


121
0:10:37,34 --> 0:10:39,44
America's native flora and fauna


122
0:10:39,44 --> 0:10:45,7
is forever changed.


123
0:10:45,7 --> 0:10:47,43
Where the bison once reined,


124
0:10:47,43 --> 0:10:52,54
cattle soon roam.


125
0:10:52,54 --> 0:10:54,17
To the settlers' delight


126
0:10:54,17 --> 0:10:59,56
their livestock multiplies more quickly here than it did in Europe.


127
0:10:59,56 --> 0:11:1,3
In a few hundred years


128
0:11:1,3 --> 0:11:4,56
European cows eat away the American grass


129
0:11:4,56 --> 0:11:6,44
and trample the soil,


130
0:11:6,44 --> 0:11:18,6
deposit their excrement and distribute the seeds of the weeds.


131
0:11:18,6 --> 0:11:20,13
The invasion of European insects


132
0:11:20,13 --> 0:11:32,11
and animals changes the American landscape for ever.


133
0:11:32,11 --> 0:11:35,18
Horses, pigs, sheep,


134
0:11:35,18 --> 0:11:36,769
goats, chickens


135
0:11:36,769 --> 0:11:42,15
and huge herds of cattle take over North and South America.


136
0:11:42,15 --> 0:11:47,6
The cattle alone doubles in numbers every fifteen months


137
0:11:47,6 --> 0:11:53,48
and feed the settlers.


138
0:11:53,48 --> 0:11:58,45
The new world settlers defend themselves inside sturdy forts


139
0:11:58,45 --> 0:12:2,96
but there are no shortages of any kind.


140
0:12:2,96 --> 0:12:7,9
Meat has become one of the cheapest food in the Americas.


141
0:12:7,9 --> 0:12:16,86
They are the best-fed people in the world.


142
0:12:16,86 --> 0:12:21,84
Hides are in great demand in America as well as in Europe.


143
0:12:21,84 --> 0:12:27,42
And fur from the wild animals they shoot brings them a steady export income.


144
0:12:27,42 --> 0:12:35,32
Some like the beaver are hunted almost to extinction.


145
0:12:35,32 --> 0:12:38,62
Settlers are not forced to adapt to the landscape.


146
0:12:38,62 --> 0:12:43,14
They domesticate and dominate it.


147
0:12:43,14 --> 0:12:46,83
Most trees are cut down and turned into pasture,


148
0:12:46,83 --> 0:12:49,331
in gardens where all kinds of vegetables


149
0:12:49,331 --> 0:12:50,93
and root crops that we know in England


150
0:12:50,93 --> 0:12:54,16
grow in profusion.


151
0:12:54,16 --> 0:12:58,42
They replace the trees they have cut down with their own trees.


152
0:12:58,42 --> 0:13:2,7
Europeans bring peaches, pears and plums.


153
0:13:2,7 --> 0:13:3,62
They bring figs


154
0:13:3,62 --> 0:13:11,28
olives and bananas.


155
0:13:11,28 --> 0:13:19,42
And their trees flourish.


156
0:13:19,42 --> 0:15:19,42
They never know
