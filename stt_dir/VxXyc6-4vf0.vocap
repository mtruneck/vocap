###0 [INTRO MUSIC]
###5 INTERVIEWER: When did you first realize you
###7 wanted to be an artist?
###10 DAN: I really wanted to be in the NBA.
###13 That didn't work out.
###15 And then I skateboarded, and I didn't really think about
###17 anything else.
###17 And then, just go to art school, because you can't go
###21 anywhere else.
###22 And you just start taking it seriously at some point.
###26 I didn't assume that I could make a living off of it as
###29 quickly as I did.
###30 It's fortunate that I didn't have to figure out
###32 something to do.
###33 I don't think I'm that good of a painter, or
###35 anything like that.
###35 I just figure it out.
###37 It's not natural.
###38 It's all really formulated.
###40 Painting from a photograph, you just study it.
###43 And you just figure out.
###44 If I just keep putting dots down, really, really slowly,
###48 forever, it'll just work out.
###53 People really like my candle paintings.
###54 That's what they really like.
###56 The last one I finished, it took me a year to make.
###58 So they take a long time.
###60 I just found this image.
###61 I was looking though a Disney book a long time ago.
###64 It's just a still from Pinocchio.
###66 It's Geppetto's work table.
###68 The candle's just extinguishing in all the
###70 paintings, and there's smoke coming out it.
###72 And there are those words up there.
###73 I don't pick them randomly, but there's no
###75 theme to the text.
###78 One says, "fuck,." One said, "so long." This one says
###83 "whatever."
###84 I made a "blow me" one.
###86 And I really liked it.
###87 And I must be a moron for it not having occurred to me.
###90 But when somebody pointed out the double entendre to it, I
###94 really started disliking it.
###95 But it was already gone.
###96 I don't really know what it's about.
###98 But it's not that.
###100 INTERVIEWER: How many of those candle
###101 paintings have you made?
###103 DAN: There is two hung over there, that are
###105 being worked on.
###106 And I have one really tiny one that I'm still working on.
###109 And that'll be 13, I think.
###110 I don't really know if 13 was a number that has any
###115 relevance to me.
###116 But I just don't need to work on them anymore.
###120 And I can't take it, also.
###122 It becomes really painful painting the same one over and
###125 over again.
###125 And in terms of--
###127 I'm not even really working on them that much anymore.
###131 I did the first lot of them.
###133 But hen you can just show people how to do them.
###136 And you work on them with them.
###138 And basically, what the assistants enable me to do is
###141 that I can work on multiple things at once.
###143 Maybe I'll fiddle with stuff or think about stuff.
###145 Or, I don't know.
###148 And I stay here all night.
###149 And I go home in the morning, and I come back.
###150 I mean I'm in here everyday, messing around with
###153 something or other.
###155 The bird shit, the kiss, and the gum all kind of come from
###159 the same place.
###160 I just started trying to pursue other ideas of making
###164 paintings or using a canvas.
###166 INTERVIEWER: It's real gum, right?
###168 DAN: It's all real gum.
###170 This is just moving them from one canvas to another.
###176 I'm just messing around.
###177 I don't really touch them at all.
###179 I just like them to look as random as possible.
###181 So I just have them transfer them between canvases.
###186 I try to get them to do it really quick.
###187 And then I come over and finesse it
###190 a little bit, maybe.
###191 It's pretty idiotic.
###193 You want me to try to talk about why I make them, and--
###196 INTERVIEWER: Yeah, absolutely.
###197 Yeah.
###199 DAN: I don't really have [INAUDIBLE] like that.
###201 But on the rocks, the rocks were about, they looked like
###204 these things that you come up to walking through the woods.
###208 And teenagers would set up camp around there.
###210 And drink beer.
###210 And so there's spray paint all over them.
###212 And people stick gum on rocks and trees.
###215 So that's were it came from, from rocks and trees, or
###218 underneath desks, all that kind of stuff.
###221 INTERVIEWER: Can I stick my gum to this one now?
###223 DAN: Yeah, go for it.
###224 INTERVIEWER: All right, awesome.
###225 Anywhere?
###226 DAN: Anywhere you want.
###227 
###230 INTERVIEWER: Cool.
###232 Thanks.
###233 DAN: Thank you.
###235 INTERVIEWER: How do you go about making this?
###237 Do you look at a lot of bird shit photos, or something?
###241 DAN: I actually would walk around Chelsea,
###242 underneath the High Line.
###244 Because you know all the birds hang out over there.
###247 And take lots of pictures.
###249 I've made a lot of them, like 150 maybe.
###252 Some look really real.
###253 Some remind people of these kind of paintings, and others,
###258 abstract paintings.
###259 You learn new techniques, but you're just throwing paint at
###261 the canvas, basically.
###263 INTERVIEWER: So this kiss one, is this one
###265 person, or many people?
###267 DAN: This is one person.
###268 I thought they had really close to a
###270 perfect set of lips.
###274 INTERVIEWER: That must have taken them forever.
###275 DAN: Took her a long time.
###276 INTERVIEWER: And it's lipstick?
###277 A lot of lipstick?
###279 DAN: Yeah, it's all lipstick.
###281 INTERVIEWER: How many tubes?
###282 DAN: She wears a little wrestling
###282 mask so that she doesn't--
###285 she was getting these horrible rashes on her nose and chins.
###288 But after she did this she said she would never ever do
###290 it again, which is too bad, because I really, really like
###292 this painting a lot.
###294 I think this is really pretty.
###296 And I feel like I never really make straightforwardly stuff
###299 that [INAUDIBLE] beautiful.
###301 But it still has enough dirty implications to satisfy that
###305 side of me.
###309 This is a Jewish prayer shawl.
###310 It's called a tallit, and it's hanging off a boner.
###314 It just came to me, randomly.
###315 Not through--
###316 
###319 it's pretty easy for somebody to think lots of different
###322 thoughts about it.
###323 But I didn't have one particular one.
###325 INTERVIEWER: Well, you're Jewish, right?
###326 DAN: I'm Jewish, yeah.
###327 INTERVIEWER: Did you get any feedback to it?
###329 DAN: People in Berlin reacted to it.
###334 And they were all ripped down really quick.
###336 But you don't know if it's Jews ripping it down, or
###340 neo-Nazis ripping it down.
###342 I couldn't say.
###344 Nobody's said anything in depth to me about it.
###346 Some people think it's silly.
###349 And some people think it's funny.
###351 I don't know.
###354 INTERVIEWER: I see another Jewish biblical theme.
###357 DAN: Yeah.
###359 I am who I am.
###360 But I still like--
###362 there's something really straightforward about it where
###364 it's like, you know, a bunch of animals
###366 bummed on Noah's ark.
###367 But beyond that, I don't have anything I can
###372 really say about it.
###373 But there's tons of religious things.
###376 Even with like something like the candle.
###378 When I first saw the image, I'm thinking something
###382 God-like about that.
###385 This is actually just a giant Constable
###386 painting that I copied.
###387 And I put in all the signs and stuff.
###390 I'm not a spiritual person, necessarily, but I think about
###393 stuff like that sometimes.
###395 So it will come up in my work.
###398 There are millions of people running around the world
###400 talking about some God.
###401 I'm curious about where he is, and stuff like that.
###405 I'd like to find him.
###407 INTERVIEWER: What do you think about the art world?
###409 Do you like the art world?
###411 DAN: I'm collected seriously.
###412 I'm in really big, important shows, especially
###415 for somebody my age.
###416 I work a lot, so I produce a lot.
###419 And people seem to like it, too.
###420 But I feel like writers and people like that would rather
###426 like not take me seriously.
###428 But I don't know exactly why.
###430 And, yeah, you could speculate something about--
###434 because my lifestyle is fun, or stupid, or whatever, that
###440 they think that I don't take my work seriously.
###443 Or maybe they're just unhappy themselves.
###449 Whatever.
###450 There's things about the art world that I
###451 don't really like.
###452 There's lots of stupid shit with market, or collectors, or
###455 curators, or bullshit like that.
###457 But I try not to think about it, and just make my work.
###462 I don't see a point in constantly bashing it or being
###466 bummed out on it.
###467 Because I'd be depressed all the time.
###469 So I just pay attention and make my work.
###472 And sometimes I'll go to a party where I have
###475 to deal with them.
###477 And I find a way to have fun.
###479 I think that if I was walking around bummed about the art
###482 world all time, I wouldn't be able to be a part of it.
###485
