###0 JEFF KROL>> Hi, my name is Jeff Kroll and I'm responsible for the supply chain and quality
###4 systems groups at McDonald's Restaurants of Canada. We're here in Southern Alberta to
###10 show you what a farm looks like, and how they operate and the conditions that the animals
###16 are under. And I am here with Bob lowe who is the co-owner of Lowe Ranch. And Bob our
###22 first questions is from Gee L. from kingston, ON. "Maybe you could post a picture of these
###29 happy 'Family farms' in which you say your animals are raised with the best care?"
###34 BOB LOWE>> Our farm is 3 generations- my father, my brother, myself, my nephew, my son. We
###40 just raise cattle the way, the way they're supposed to be raised, I guess. If you're
###46 a cow, it's pretty idyllic. The mother cows are on pasture year round. The calves, after
###52 their weened, will go into the feedlot.
###53 JEFF KROL>> And what do they feed on when they are here?
###57 BOB Lowe: Grass- just grass.
###59 JEFF KROL>> And how big is this area we are looking at?
###62 BOB LOWE>> Well, this particular field is 320 acres. We've got pastures in the mountains
###67 that are 24,000 acres.
###68 JEFF KROLL>> Wow. That's a lot of pasture
###71 BOB LOWE>> Yeah. hahaha
###73 JEFF KROL>> You mentioned a feedlot. Would we be able to actually go out and see a feedlot?
###78 BOB LOWE>> We can do that. We have a feedlot as a part of our operation.
###82 JEFF KROL>> Fantastic.
###83 BOB LOWE>> As you can see, that's my house over there. It's 200 yards from the feedlot.
###88 I can walk to work. My kids, when they were little, could come over and see me anytime.
###93 It's important to me that the consumers are told the truth about where their food comes
###99 from. We aren't trying to gloss anything. What we do- we are proud of what we do. WE,
###104 what we produce in this feedlot and I wouldn't try to sell it to somebody else if I wouldn't
###108 eat it myself.
###109 JEFF KROL>> So Bob, where are we now?
###111 BOB LOWE>>Right now we're at the feedlot, it's another division of our farm. This is
###116 where the calves will come after their weened.
###119 JEEF KROL>> And would this be the average size for a feedlot?
###123 BOB LOWE>> We're 4000 head capacity. We're probably considered a medium sized feedlot
###127 in Alberta.
###128 JEFF KROL>> How many months will they actually be here.
###130 BOB LOWE>> The ones that are going back into the breeding herd will be here about 5 months.
###135 The ones that will go into the food chain will be here about 8 months.
###138 JEFF KROL>> Our next question is from Squid N. "What do you feed your animals?". So Bob,
###144 what is actually in the feed?
###146 BOB LOWE>> We feed a mixture of straw, silage, grain and a mineral pack. The straw is this.
###152 As you can see it's from a mature plant. This is barley straw. Silage is just an immature
###158 plant. It is green. The nutrient content is spread through the whole plant instead of
###162 just in the seed head. The barley seed from the mature plant looks like this. This is
###167 the milled barley. That just basically means it's crushed. The reason we do it is to improve
###172 the digestion. We do feed analysis on all our feed and where it's lacking in vitamins
###178 and minerals we get custom formulated mineral pack. This is a sample of the mixed ration
###184 that comes out of the feed truck. The silage the straw, you can see some grain kernels
###189 in there. That's just, that's what the cattle get to eat.
###193 JEFF KROL>> Our next question is from Emily. "Does the animal feed contain any antibiotics?".
###200 I'm here with Calvin Booker, who is a Vetrinarian in Souther Alberta and actually Bob's local
###205 Vertinarian. And Calvin and Bob I'm hoping we can answer Emily's questions.
###211 CALVIN BOOKER>>So, Jeff some of the feed we feed animals, Cadilac seed, does contain antibiotics.
###216 Depends on what stage of the production cycle the animals are in and what particular diseases
###221 they might be susceptible to at that point in the production cycle. We would look to
###225 on of the licensed anti-microbial products in Canada to try and prevent and control diseases
###232 that might occur in the cattle population. Cattle are- in some ways- a lot like people.
###237 They get sick from a lot of different diseases. Some of those are infectious diseases like
###242 the common cold and others might be metabolic disturbances or digestive disease like when
###247 we have an upset stomach. For the animal health products that we use in Canada, their approved
###253 and regulated as to how we can use those by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency or the
###258 Vetrianary Drugs Directorate Division of Health Canada. Included in that would be
