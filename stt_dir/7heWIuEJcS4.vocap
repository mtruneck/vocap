###18 SHANE: We just got into rebel controlled Libya.
###20 This is a checkpoint the rebels are controlling.
###23 They're controlling more and more and more to Libya with
###26 each passing day.
###27 We're just wondering when they're going to actually get
###29 to Tripoli.
###31 [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###32 
###35 SHANE: They left the army and joined the revolution.
###37 [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###39 
###43 SHANE: Where they worried if Gaddafi won they would get in
###45 a lot of trouble?
###46 [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###48 
###54 SHANE: He's a very courageous man.
###55 [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###56 
###67 SHANE: Like most journalists, I'd been fascinated by Libya
###70 for a long time.
###70 While Gaddafi was in power, it was much like North Korea- a
###74 hermit-like Stalinist cult of personality state, with an
###77 absolute dictator at it's head.
###79 To get in was extremely difficult.
###81 [MIDDLE EASTERN MUSIC]
###86 SHANE: In 2010, after years of trying, I managed to wrangle
###90 an invitation to a youth conference there.
###92 We didn't really care about the event itself.
###94 But we wanted to talk to people on the street, and see
###96 what was really happening inside of Libya, and how it
###99 was affected by Gaddafi's brutal regime.
###103 But very shortly after we got there, we were arrested for
###105 sightseeing without our minders, put under house
###108 arrest, and repeatedly threatened with jail.
###111 CAMERAMAN: Was that a knock?
###112 If they ask me why I'm shooting I'm going to say this
###115 is evidence just in case something happens to us.
###117 SHANE: Oh that's good.
###118 They'll take our fucking tapes.
###120 Evidence.
###122 Don't come here.
###123 Don't ever come here.
###126 They finally let us out on the day before we were supposed to
###128 fly, but only with two secret police minders, who wouldn't
###131 be on camera, and one youth guy who was very, very freaky.
###135 
###144 Right.
###145 
###151 We finally got out of Libya in November of 2010.
###155 And this was Libya only three months later, in February.
###157 [ROCK MUSIC AND CROWDS CHANTING]
###159 
###164 SHANE: I didn't see Arab Spring coming, not a lot of
###166 people did.
###167 But I especially didn't see it happening in Libya, because
###170 Gaddafi had such a stranglehold of
###172 fear over the country.
###173 But unlike Egypt and Tunisia, which were largely peaceful
###175 protests, Gaddafi wouldn't back down, and soon began
###179 killing his own people.
###180 [GUNSHOTS AND SCREAMING]
###185 SHANE: Then it exploded into a full fledged revolution, with
###188 Gaddafi, his army, sub-Saharan mercenaries, and his arsenal
###191 on one side, and citizens turned rebels with whatever
###195 weapons they could find on the other.
###197 [GUNSHOTS]
###199 SHANE: Surprisingly, Libya had become the tip of the spear of
###202 the Arab revolution.
###203 And we had to go back to see for ourselves what was
###206 happening, and to talk to the rebels who had shocked the
###208 world by opposing their dictator.
###209 [GUNSHOTS]
###211 SHANE: So in July of 2011, at the height of the conflict, we
###214 headed to the front lines, which were located about 200
###217 kilometers east of Tripoli, in the port city of Misrata.
###221 The problem was getting to Misrata was not easy.
###224 NATO had imposed a no fly zone over Libya, as a way to help
###228 the rebels.
###228 So the only way into the country was to actually fly to
###231 Cairo, in Egypt, then drive 20 hours across the Sahara Desert
###235 to the border.
###236 Once there, you had to wait for the rebels to come across,
###239 and then bring you over.
###240 After that, you had to drive another 15 hours to Benghazi,
###243 the rebel capital where, if you were lucky, you could
###247 hitchhike onto a boat, which was the only way
###249 in or out of Misrata.
###251 
###253 As we drove through Benghazi, it was hard to believe that
###256 this was where the revolution had started.
###258 Fisherman's were still fishing.
###259 The electricity was on.
###261 People were working.
###262 It seemed amazing to me how normally people were going
###265 about their daily lives [INAUDIBLE] the fighting here
###267 had just recently ended.
###269 But Misrata was another story.
###271 There was still heavy fighting there.
###273 It was completely surrounded by Gaddafi's troops.
###276 So the few ships the rebels could muster were the only way
###278 to supply the city.
###280 [SIREN]
###281 SHANE: We finally got to the port, where we met Captain
###283 Ali, the harbor master, who promised to help us get on one
###287 of the rare boats into Misrata.
###290 Is this the ship?
###291 CAPTAIN ALI: Yes, that's the one.
###292 SHANE: So this ship just arrived.
###294 CAPTAIN ALI: Yes.
###295 SHANE: And now it's going to turn right around and go back.
###298 CAPTAIN ALI: Yes.
###299 SHANE: And what are they going to load onto the ship?
###301 CAPTAIN ALI: They are loading food, medical assistance.
###306 [INAUDIBLE].
###307 
###310 SHANE: This is the lifeline.
###311 The only lifeline to Misrata is from
###315 this ship from Benghazi.
###317 CAPTAIN ALI: Yes, that's the only one.
###318 SHANE: And is there a lot of fighting in Misrata right now?
###321 CAPTAIN ALI: Yes, right now, yes.
###322 SHANE: And the rebels are trying to
###323 push towards Tripoli?
###324 CAPTAIN ALI: They are pushing towards, not trying.
###326 I We are pushing towards Tripoli.
###328 SHANE: And aren't you worried for being a rebel, that--
###330 CAPTAIN ALI: No way.
###331 No way.
###332 Because I will not allow him to catch me alive.
###334 SHANE: Yes.
###336 CAPTAIN ALI: Either we meet in Tripoli or we meet in Heaven.
###339 SHANE: So it's either victory or death.
###341 CAPTAIN ALI: Yes, either victory or death.
###344 There is no other solution.
###345 No retreat, no surrender.
###347 SHANE: And what do the people here think of Gaddafi?
###350 SHANE: He is the father of the devil, not
###351 the son of the devil.
###354 The devil is ashamed of what he's doing now to Libya.
###357 We already know that he is crazy, but we never thought
###359 that he would do this harm to us.
###362 
###365 SHANE: Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, or the brother
###367 leader, as he likes to be called, is a textbook
###369 tyrannical dictator.
###371 In fact, he's possibly the worst
###373 despot in recent history.
###375 In his 40 year reign, he's been both
###376 ruthless and eccentric.
###378 He publicly hangs dissenters at home, and he hunts down
###381 those that escape abroad.
###382 And has been the financial supporter of pretty much every
###385 terrorist organization you can imagine.
###388 And he's actually admitted to terrorist acts, like the
###391 Lockerbie bombing in 1988.
###394 And his brutal response to his own people's call for reform
###397 was so barbaric that he's recently been charged with
###400 crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court.
###404 CAPTAIN ALI: We will punish them.
###405 We will take them to court and put them in jail.
###407 
###410 They came to kill our kids.
###413 They came to rape our women.
###416 They came to vanish us from the face of the earth.
###420 We will get rid of him, sooner or later.
###423 
###430 SHANE: And despite the fact that the boat was already
###432 overcrowded, Captain Ali was good to his word, and got us
###435 on the last ferry to Misrata.
###436 
###440 [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]
###453 SHANE: So we're getting on the last boat to Misrata, to see
###456 the sharp end of the revolution.
###459 They're going [INAUDIBLE] to push to Tripoli.
###462 The slogan of the revolution is, our capitalist revolution.
###465 Meaning they're not going to settle for half and half.
###468 They were telling us today, they're going to fight until
###470 they're dead, because if they don't win, they're dead.
###472 
###480 SHANE: Hello.
###481 REBEL: Hello.
###481 SHANE: How are you?
###482 REBEL: How are you?
###482 No Gaddafi.
###483 SHANE: No Gaddafi.
###484 No Gaddafi.
###485 REBEL: No Gadaffi.
###485 SHANE: No Gaddafi.
###488 And so you go every couple of days to Misrata?
###492 
###500 How long have you been doing the trip?
###503 Four months?
###504 From the beginning you've been going back and forth?
###506 
###511 When did that happen?
###514 One day ago they bombed this boat?
###517 
###523 You think there will be more missiles when we go?
###525 [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]
###544 SHANE: So in the long boat ride from Benghazi to the
###546 front lines of Misrata, everyone was concerned with
###549 only one thing--
###550 getting back to the fight.
###552 And it didn't matter in what condition.
###554 They could have broken arms and broken legs, and in some
###557 cases, they could even have missing limbs.
###559 
###563 So he was just saying that he lost his leg.
###567 And he was supposed to go to complete his statement.
###569 But he snuck out of the hospital to go back
###570 to Misrata to fight.
###572 And how is it there now?
###574 Does he know how it is now?
###576 [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###577 
###586 SHANE: And if they don't kill Gaddafi what happens?
###589 [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###590 
###595 SHANE: Though the fighting had been going on for nearly six
###597 months at this point, every rebel we met on the boat was
###600 still defiant.
###601 Even though the odds seemed so stacked against them, most
###604 were still really optimistic about
###606 their chances for victory.
###607 [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]
###619 [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###620 
###631 [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###633 
###641 [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###643 
###655 SHANE: And even though Gaddafi's troops had a vastly
###657 superior arsenal, the rebels would fight them with anything
###660 they could find.
###661 [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###664 [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###665 [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###667 [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###668 
###682 We also spoke to a higher ranking rebel officer, who was
###685 returning to the fight in Misrata, about what conditions
###687 were like on the ground.
###690 Has there been fighting in Misrata recently?
###692 [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###693 
###710 SHANE: Good luck.
###711 OFFICER: Thank you.
###712 
###721 [SHOUTING IN ARABIC]
###725 SHANE: So we're arriving now in Misrata, which is
###728 completely encircled by Gaddafi's troops.
###731 They're trying to push forwards to Tripoli.
###732 It's the front lines.
###734 It's very close to Tripoli.
###735 In fact, this boat is the only way in.
###737 It's the only way out.
###738 It's carrying about 300 troops, machine guns, aid.
###742 There's been heavy fighting here.
###744 Some journalists have been killed.
###745 
###751 As we pulled into the port, there wasn't a lot of evidence
###753 of the past fighting that had gone on.
###755 There was some minor damage to a few of the port buildings.
###758 There were a couple of Mad Max style trucks with machine guns
###761 bolted on the back.
###762 But other than that, it was strangely quiet.
###765 But that quiet didn't last very long.
###769 So we just arrived in Misrata.
###772 We're hearing artillery or rocket attacks.
###774 [GENERAL COMMOTION AND DISTANT BOOMING]
###776 
###784 SHANE: You can see the smoke coming up there.
###786 
###789 They know the ship is arriving, so they send some
###790 missiles just to let them know we're here.
###793 
###797 Hello.
###798 Thank you.
###800 Good, how are you?
###802 Good.
###803 
###809 [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###811 
###815 Driving into Misrata, it seemed like spirits were
###817 really high, and the city was functioning quite well.
###819 
###822 Anyone who drove by us beeped their
###823 horns and waved excitedly.
###825 It was only when we reached the city center that we
###827 realized how immediate and devastating the battles had
###830 really been.
###833 [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###834 
###842 SHANE: Some of the heaviest fighting that took place in
###844 the revolution was right here on Tripoli Street, which is
###847 one of the main arteries of Misrata, and connects the city
###850 to Tripoli itself.
###852 Gaddafi had ordered his troops not to surrender in Misrata,
###855 so the fighting had been particularly fierce here.
###858 His troops holed up on a high building, and picked off
###860 fighters until the rebels had finally overwhelmed them.
###865 The old building manager took us inside
###867 to show us the aftermath.
###870 [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###871 
###1001 [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]
###1022 SHANE: The fighting on Tripoli Street had ended shortly
###1024 before we got there.
###1025 In and front lines had moved on, about 20 kilometers down
###1027 the road, towards Tripoli itself.
###1030 So to get there we hitched a ride with a rebel driver, who
###1033 was running weapons to the front.
###1034 [MIDDLE EASTERN MUSIC]
###1049 [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###1050 
###1076 SHANE: One of the first places he was bringing weapons to was
###1078 this kind of half junkyard, half post
###1081 apocalyptic weapons factory.
###1082 
###1086 Every kind of gun or missile launcher, or any kind of
###1089 weapon you could possibly imagine, was
###1091 affixed to a truck.
###1094 And your truck got blown up, fine.
###1096 They just put your gun on a new truck,
###1098 and you keep fighting.
###1099 [MIDDLE EASTERN MUSIC]
###1104 [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###1106 
###1109 [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###1110 
###1125 SHANE: And course, anything that Gaddafi's troops left
###1127 behind was put back into use as quickly as possible.
###1130 
###1135 And that included not only machine guns and anti-aircraft
###1138 batteries, but also tanks, and other heavy weaponry, like
###1141 these grad missile launching trucks that we
###1143 spotted on the beach.
###1145 SHANE: Stop.
###1146 We want to walk down and say hi.
###1148 
###1151 Well, one way to find out.
###1154 MOHAMMED: Shane Smitch.
###1155 Shane--
###1155 SHANE: Shane Smith, yeah.
###1156 MOHAMMED: Smith, Shane Smith.
###1158 Friend.
###1158 SHANE: Friend.
###1159 OK.
###1160 Yes.
###1162 Russian?
###1163 MOHAMMED: Yes.
###1165 SHANE: These missiles shoot 20 kilometers?
###1170 At Gaddafi's people?
###1172 MOHAMMED: Yes.
###1173 
###1179 [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###1180 
###1183 SHANE: They stole them or took them back from Gaddafi's
###1187 troops, and they're firing them at Gaddafi's troops.
###1189 And they come out here.
###1190 And then they make this big hole with flames.
###1193 So they've been firing quite a few out of here.
###1196 You can see the spent casings.
###1199 And they're targeting where, exactly?
###1201 [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###1202 
###1207 SHANE: And when we came in yesterday at the port, they
###1209 fired some grad missiles at the port.
###1211 [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###1212 
###1223 SHANE: And when do they fire their missiles?
###1225 [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###1226 
###1238 SHANE: They were just telling me they get their coordinates
###1240 through Google.
###1241 Arab Spring--
###1242 Facebook, Twitter, for their demonstrations.
###1245 And Google if you want to bomb them.
###1246 Technology at work.
###1248 So you push the button?
###1249 MOHAMMED: Yes, boom.
###1252 SHANE: Shoot rocket. .
###1253 This one's fully charged.
###1254 It looks like they're using it a lot more.
###1257 Fully charged and ready to go.
###1258 
###1262 New?
###1263 New weapons.
###1266 You want the newest?
###1268 Gaddafi has new weapons.
###1269 
###1272 He's asking Clinton and Obama to send more weapons, so that
###1276 they can go take Tripoli, so he can live his a dream, which
###1279 is to play for the Miami Heat basketball.
###1281 MOHAMMED: Yes.
###1282 SHANE: Yes.
###1283 He wants to come to America.
###1284 
###1294 OK.
###1295 
###1304 The thing that struck me the most as we got closer to the
###1306 front line was just how incredibly young some of these
###1309 rebels were.
###1311 It was pretty surreal to watch these kids, barely out of
###1314 puberty, fighting and dying for this
###1316 abstract concept of freedom.
###1318 Abstract because real freedom was something they've never
###1321 known, as Gaddafi had been in power since
###1324 before they were born.
###1325 
###1332 After long days of traveling through Libya, we were 20
###1335 kilometers outside of Misrata, and closing in on the front.
###1339 Our driver handed us off to other rebels, who could take
###1342 us the rest of the way.
###1343 
###1358 When we finally got to the front, they were really
###1360 nervous about our camera giving away their location.
###1363 And we had to limit our shots.
###1364 
###1377 They were obviously digging in, and preparing an attack
###1380 that they told us they were expecting within the next 12
###1383 to 24 hours.
###1397 In fact, while we were there, they got word that a major
###1400 offensive was about to start.
###1401 So they advised to leave Misrata as soon as we possibly
###1404 could, because they thought the offensive
###1406 was going to be huge.
###1407 [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###1408 
###1421 There's no ships out.
###1424 We took the last ship in.
###1426 So we're going to take this fishing boat.
###1429 Aside from ourselves, the captain had also taken on a
###1432 few rebels who were heading back Benghazi They saw our
###1435 cameras and offered to show us some pics of their own.
###1437 
###1445 The boat back to Benghazi only motored about seven
###1447 kilometers an hour.
###1448 And this afforded me a lot of time to think about
###1451 what I had just seen.
###1452 I had witnessed something in Libya that is usually only
###1455 read about in history books--
###1457 revolution.
###1458 People rising up against a tyrant, and risking
###1461 everything to do.
###1462 [ANIMATED INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]
###1467 SHANE: Everyone, without exception, when we asked them
###1469 why they were fighting, responded the same way.
###1472 And so young Libyans are risking their lives to--
###1475 CAPTAIN ALI: Only for freedom.
###1477 We want to be like Europe, like [INAUDIBLE].
###1481 We don't ask for much.
###1482 SHANE: Right.
###1482 [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###1484 
###1490 [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###1491 
###1495 [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###1498 [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###1499 
###1506 SHANE: Despite still being surrounded by Gaddafi's
###1508 troops, everyone on board was convinced that the fall of
###1510 Tripoli was just around the corner.
###1513 And it turned out they were right.
###1515 About a month later, that's exactly what happened.
###1517 [ANIMATED INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]
###1521 SHANE: Suddenly, after a long stalemate, on August 21, the
###1524 rebels finally stormed Tripoli.
###1526 [ANIMATED INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]
###1533 SHANE: Now the next few months will probably be very ugly, as
###1536 the rebels switch from fighting to governing, which
###1539 will be problematic and filled with uncertainty.
###1543 What just happened in Libya gives me hope that indeed we
###1547 can write our own history.
