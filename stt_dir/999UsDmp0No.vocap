###36 - Um, how much is this? - £3.
###39 Ahh. Mmm...
###42 Is there something wrong with your head?
###46 Are you wagging it to say no or is it just uncontrollable?
###49 - Uh... - You want the price put down?
###52 Well, I was thinking £2.
###54 Because £3 is just naked profiteering for a book a mere...
###59 912 pages long?
###61 What'll I do with that extra pound?
###64 I'll add an acre to the grounds,
###66 I'll chuck some more koi carp in my piano-shaped pond.
###69 No, I'll build a wing on the National Gallery in my name.
###73 - 2.50. - That's more like it.
###76 - Hm. - Now you're being reasonable.
###81 2.50...
###83 gets you... this much,
###86 you can have the rest for the other 50p.
###89 - But you... - Thank you.
###95 - Bernard... - Don't start, customer lover.
###98 I was just gonna say I'm off to get the paint.
###101 Why? The shop is the way it is because it is the way it is.
###104 Otherwise it wouldn't be the way it is.
###106 - It needs doing. - It has character.
###110 Character is an ambience, a feeling.
###113 It's not something with fur and a beak.
###116 (Scampering, grunting)
###121 (Anguished yowl)
###125 They've moved the nest again.
###128 I was gonna get two brushes, by the way.
###130 You can paint with both hands?
###132 - I was thinking... - No, you just thought you were.
###135 - Well, maybe if... - No!
###137 - But if... - No!
###139 I don't want to be bothered, you big, hairy...
###145 - Oh, hello. - Hello.
###147 - What's the matter with you? - Dunno.
###151 I'm just a big cloud of dunno.
###155 Since my shop closed I feel empty all the time.
###158 You hated your shop.
###159 Yeah, but hating it took up my whole life.
###163 Without it I'm disconnected. I buy things to cheer myself up.
###167 I go to get a paper and I come back with all this.
###172 Chocolate, magazines.
###177 - And a Vauxhall Astra. - Ah.
###180 Well, this is a very difficult time for you, you know.
###183 You should get professional help.
###186 - So I should talk to a... - Barman, yes. The pub, now.
###189 - It's that serious? - Oh, yes.
###192 Manny, can you look after the shop until Manny gets...
###197 You're not busy. Keep an eye on the shop. For an hour.
###202 (Scampering, grunting)
###223 (Till chiming)
###238 (# Quiet classical)
###240 Sorry, wrong shop.
###260 Manny!
###262 (Cappuccino machine gurgling)
###275 Hello, sir. I am the information point. Can I help you?
###279 I hope so. I was looking for a pair of hobnail boots.
###283 I want to jump on somebody who's ruining my life.
###286 I can explain. I went to get paint
###288 and I went to that big bookshop, Saga Books.
###292 They had coffee and places to sit.
###295 I thought, "We need to be more like them."
###297 I walked in and I instantly bought £114 worth of books,
###301 all because it was so nice.
###303 Look at this. A novel by a 12-year-old Spaniard.
###306 An account of the Nazi space programme.
###309 - Er... - This won't work!
###311 A large-print biography of Basil Brush.
###313 Actually, that's quite good.
###317 No one needs sofas that eat you. No one needs information points.
###321 Fran did. She wanted something to occupy her,
###323 so I suggested she check out her family tree.
###326 And I informed her of our new genealogy section.
###329 Hey right, if you trace it back, and I might be wrong about this,
###334 I come from a very good line
###336 and apparently, I am Queen Victoria's...
###340 uncle.
###343 - I'll start again. - It's all going back to how it was.
###347 Coffee and books is a fad.
###349 Nobody is gonna be fooled by this.
###352 Excuse me, could I have these, please?
###354 - They're £80. - It's a lot, isn't it?
###356 But your information point showed me where they were,
###360 I sat on your comfortable sofa and scanned them and thought,
###363 "Oh, treat yourself."
###369 Come again!
###371 With coffee that good, I think I will.
###411 (Door opens)
###416 Bernard, Bernard, put your thing on.
###423 I'm back now.
###424 I KNOW!
###431 I've been to the shops. That deserves a star.
###434 No, stars are for achievement.
###438 My 40th cigarette this afternoon,
###441 that deserves a star.
###444 (Scampering, grunting)
###453 (Squealing)
###457 OK, this is brilliant.
###459 I had another go at my family tree
###461 and I've got relatives from eastern Europe
###463 living practically round the corner!
###466 - Is that news or what? - Ooh.
###468 It's amazing, putting it together.
###470 Stop me if this gets boring. You check the records...
###473 Stop.
###477 Well, I don't care. Because I've got roots.
###481 I don't need you.
###483 - Sorry to be such a BORE! - (Feedback)
###486 Now, if you'll excuse me, I am going to be with my people.
###491 (Squealing)
###514 Um...
###516 - poliknish. - Poliknish!
###527 No, no, don't wipe.
###530 You've never had a traditional Tishtayan kiss before.
###535 You poor girl!
###540 - Here she is. - Oh, Fran! Poliknish!
###546 This is Frederic.
###550 Martina.
###557 - And Gregor. - (Grunting)
###559 Naughty!
###561 - Our long-Iost cousin. - Sit, Fran, sit.
###566 Drink bean tea with us.
###570 Oh, it's in a little glass.
###574 No, no, that's your right hand.
###576 That's how they drink tea in Athbekistan.
###579 Anyone who drinks tea with their right hand is an enemy.
###590 Hooray.
###592 So, tell us all about yourself, Fran.
###595 - Well, I was born... - Do you have a car?
###599 Yes. I mean, it's just an Astra.
###602 - (AII gasping) - To have such a success in our family.
###606 Someone who owns an Astra!
###612 - (Whispering) - P-Poliknish.
###616 Oh, isn't this nice?
###622 P-Poliknish.
###628 I have to have the rest of that book. Here's that 50p.
###632 (Sighs)
###635 Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.
###638 I was thinking £15.
###640 - What? - No, you're right. 25.
###643 This is totally unfair.
###648 Mmm. Mmm.
###653 What you did contravenes our Customer Code Promise Pledge.
###657 - What? - If we're gonna compete,
###659 we must offer equal service.
###661 - That's why we made the CCPP. - Oh, we did, did we?
###664 You were helping a customer at the time.
###667 The fellow with the red hair, kept calling you Bern cos of your badge.
###671 That's quite funny, actually. Bern.
###676 One - the customer is not only always right,
###679 he or she is also fun to be around.
###681 Remark on their wise choices and laugh at their jokes.
###685 If you happen to be wearing a top of lower cut than usual,
###689 - well, no harm done. - Can't say it's not working.
###693 Two - if the sides of your head don't hurt, smile more.
###697 Yes. More, more...
###700 No, that looks nasty. Take it down. That's it.
###705 The management should have regular meetings with the staff
###709 to sound out any grievances.
###711 - How's it going? - Fine.
###712 Good. Meeting over.
###716 - Oh, look, you've popped out. - (Snap)
###723 (Gasping, stammering)
###732 - What are you doing tomorrow? - Nothing planned.
###735 Martina's moving into a new flat and she needs a bit of help
###739 - and none of us have a car. - Oh, no, no. I couldn't.
###743 - I'll help, no problem. - Ta, ta.
###746 After that, there's some ham I need to pick up from Folkestone.
###750 - Lots of ham. - Folkestone?
###754 S-Sure, I'll take you, yeah.
###757 Hooray!
###762 Bernard, see that bloke with the cappuccino?
###765 I sold him Ulysses, a Ulysses guide and a handbook to the Ulysses guide.
###769 Can I have a star, please?
###772 You... can have... as many stars
###777 as you... like
###779 because I'm not doing this any more.
###782 I want less people in the shop. If we're not reordering books,
###786 we're steaming milk for the bambaccinos.
###788 We're like a high-street chain.
###791 They don't respect us because we've given them everything.
###798 Wait a minute...
###800 Where did they go? What did we do?
###802 It's 12:45, they're getting food.
###805 Is our coffee not enough?
###807 - You wanted less people here. - Don't twist my words.
###809 You said "less people in the shop".
###812 We can't let them leave. We can feed them. Lunch and dinner.
###815 And we'll build a pool. And a gym!
###818 And an Egyptian-style casino. No, that's a bit much.
###822 But if they could eat, they'd stay and buy books all day.
###825 From now on, we run a full restaurant service.
###828 Do your friends at Saga Books do that, huh? I don't think so.
###832 - We can't run a restaurant. - Course we can.
###835 Because from now on, the only stars we'll be looking at will be Dunlop stars!
###839 - Michelin stars. - Them as well!
###844 (Laughter)
###856 Oh, I'm tired, Grandma. Can I have a cold drink, please?
###860 Oh, Fran, what you need is some hot bean tea, eh?
###864 (Chuckling)
###866 I'm sorry I couldn't help with the hams but it musses up my hair.
###872 I, uh, I think I'll go home, get to bed.
###875 Yes, rest, Fran. Then on Saturday you'll take Gregor to the hospital.
###880 It's a little out of the way - Aberdeen.
###883 Oh, no, no, I can't.
###885 Take a jiffy, maybe two little jiffies.
###888 I can't, because I'm...
###891 I'm giving a talk. At the London School of Economics.
###895 And also, I have to have a bath.
###897 Let me explain, Fran.
###903 Any one member of the family is like this bean.
###908 But the family is tightly bound, like this sausage.
###913 And if one member does not help the family,
###918 well...
###924 Saturday, you drive.
###942 Have you got the lobsters?
###944 Put them in the pot.
###946 - What's it gonna be? - Our signature dish - luxury pie.
###951 The food of kings.
###953 Truffles, saffron,
###955 caviar... and champagne.
###959 Drizzle it, drizzle it.
###971 (Sniffing deeply)
###972 Mmmmm.
###974 Rich. OK, starter's done.
###978 - Now for the mains. - (Scampering)
###980 The food's attracting those creatures. They've got bigger.
###984 Look, he's got an onion!
###986 All the best kitchens are dirty. Slice the garlic.
###991 They're getting huge.
###993 We'll soon be able to saddle 'em up and ride into town.
###997 I'm not totally convinced we should open as a restaurant
###1000 and if we do - and I'm not entirely sure -
###1002 I don't think we should open tonight.
###1005 Shut up. I'm trying to make crème brûlée.
###1013 Must you drink so much?
###1015 How else will we get candles in empty wine bottles?
###1019 Here's two for you, get stuck in.
###1023 Why are you talking in English? Only French in my kitchen.
###1026 - Il n'y a pas d'anything else. - (Creatures grunting)
###1032 Putain!
###1035 Mine, I think.
###1037 - I'm in trouble, I need advice. - Hang on.
###1050 - Right. - That family I found.
###1052 I met them, became one of them and I want to get rid of them.
###1056 Right.
###1059 And you got me into it. So Mr Information Man, how do I get out?
###1064 OK. What about this?
###1070 - Fran! - How's the car?
###1073 Never better.
###1075 Ooh, tea.
###1078 (AII gasping)
###1080 Oh! My right hand, how awful.
###1085 Oh, I'll make it up to you, by singing the Tishtayan national anthem.
###1090 I've been practising it.
###1092 Ahem.
###1094 (# Sings deeply and off-key)
###1101 No, no, that's the Athbekistan national anthem -
###1106 that verse mocks our country's nuclear power facilities.
###1109 Well, you'll have to disown me now, won't you?
###1113 People with Astras can drink with their right hand and sing whatever they like.
###1118 That's how it's been for centuries.
###1121 So, we forgive you.
###1124 Let's celebrate with a drive around town and an up-slap meal.
###1132 - Where's the thing? - On top of the thing!
###1140 Blancmange is always so fiddly.
###1142 Gourmet food is always presented in little towers. What's that?
###1146 - Soup. - Well, get it in a tower.
###1148 You're a cook, you have to commit. Show me your hands.
###1152 Cooks have burns.
###1155 We're cooks.
###1157 I'll do it to myself... later.
###1159 Come on, quickly, quickly!
###1164 Come on!
###1168 - Fran, our food's very late. - Fran, make food come.
###1175 Manny, I can't get rid of them.
###1177 - Fran, be a waitress. - No, I'm sick of doing favours.
###1181 - I can pay you. - Really?
###1182 - No. - OK.
###1184 Take this out to table 12...
###1186 No, there are no plates.
###1188 Well, use...
###1190 recipe books with pictures of plates!
###1193 Do I have to explain everything here?
###1198 Not enough mint.
###1200 Manny, do you have a tower of soup for me?
###1208 What's this? Where are the turrets?
###1210 It's rubbish, start again!
###1213 - Where are my ingredients? - We've cooked them all!
###1216 I don't care!
###1218 I can make a feast from anything. This paint.
###1221 This paint will make a tasty dish.
###1225 My oven can cook anything, my oven can cook...
###1229 bits of oven.
###1232 Yes. Yes!
###1235 Yes, oh yes, oh yes.
###1246 Excellent food at reasonable prices - it's not that hard.
###1249 Is everyone finished being sick yet?
###1252 (Woman moaning)
###1254 No, I think Grandma has some way still to go.
###1258 (Moaning)
###1262 I brought you here.
###1264 You all got food poisoning. It's all my fault.
###1267 I can't ask you to forgive me now.
###1270 The bonds of third cousinhood can never be broken.
###1275 Now, you take us home.
###1278 Wait a minute.
###1287 (Glass shatters)
###1291 Oh, no! Something terrible has happened.
###1308 Someone set fire to the car!
###1312 Still, I know that in this moment of hardship,
###1317 my family will stick by me.
###1320 The...
###1332 No, no, they didn't go there, they went over there.
###1339 We're a book shop, Manny.
###1341 - What is wrong with that? - Yeah.
###1344 Trying to be a restaurant, what were we thinking?
###1347 - Yeah. - (Scampering and grunting)
###1351 With the bloody sofa and the stupid coffee.
###1354 Ridiculous. The place is lovely as it is.
###1360 Oh, I'm free.
###1363 Anyway, my friends have always been my real family.
###1367 - What do you want? - Tenner.
###1370 - For a taxi to my evening class. - What are you doing?
###1373 Persian Cats Throughout French History, just to fill the time.
###1378 (Mewing, grunting)
###1383 (Snorting)
###1386 (Squealing)
###1391 I did it. I got the queen.
