###28 Female Speaker   I'm honored to bring before you today a group of distinguished
###31 leaders who've helped navigate our state and country through some
###35 of the most difficult and important natural resource issues of our time.
###39 These individuals have led in the US Senate, have led US agencies
###44 including the US Environmental Protection Agency, the US Fish and wildlife
###48 Service, the Department of State International Environment and scientific
###52 affairs, have led us as the governor of the State of Wyoming, have led
###57 us as senators in Wyoming, have led us as ambassadors to foreign countries,
###62 and led a US commission on financial responsibility and reform.  They
###66 have led major conservation and scientific foundations, the Conservation Fund,
###71 and the World Resources Institute.  These individuals have dedicated
###75 themselves to leading through collaboration which is our topic today.  Through
###80 crossing the divides that occur between the values and interests surrounding
###84 thorny natural resource issues.  DDT, wolves, spotted owls, salmon,
###90 land management conflicts, agriculture, energy development and conservation
###96 and balancing those.  They have mastered and applied for decades the art
###100 of bringing people together and finding common goals.  From its conception
###105 to our current day activities, these individuals have helped shape the
###109 Ruckelshaus Institute University of Wyoming for over 20 years.
###113 All of them have served and 2 still  do, on the board of the Ruckelshaus
###118 Institute, uh and as chairs of the  Ruckelshaus Institute. As holds
###123 true when they helped create the Institute today the mission of the
###126 Ruckelshaus Institute is to advance the understanding and solution of
###130 complex environment and natural resources challenges and support stake holder
###135 driven solutions to environmental challenges by communicating important
###139 research and promoting collaborative decision making.  It is a great
###144 honor to bring together Mike Sullivan, Senator Al Simpson, John
###148 Turner, and Bill Ruckelshaus. Let's give a warm thanks to their coming.
###152 [Applause]
###156 Mike Sullivan Thank you very much in the uh in the and
###159 good afternoon ladies and gentleman.  I feel a bit like I'm standing
###163 on a precipice with a boulder and all I have to do is push the boulder
###169 and watch it roll for a couple of hours because I don't know how you
###173 could facilitate or moderate these 3 individuals.  [Laughter]
###178 but every now and then I may, uh, may step in and see if there is anything
###183 that that I can ask that you might be interested in and then I think
###187 at the end of the uh session we are going to have about toward the end
###191 of the session if we could dampenem down a little we'll have about
###197 20 minutes for you to ask questions that would be of interest to you.
###200 Let me start by just talking about the collaborative process for maybe
###205 30 seconds because of we have a a number of experts in collaboration
###212 and other means of negotiations sitting sitting  here but uh it was clear
###218 20 years ago when the Ruckelshaus Institute was formed that the sensitive
###223 issues in Wyoming and and most of those surround natural resources
###228 and the environment needed to have some kind of a different forum or
###235 process by which some of these issues could be resolved.  And uh to the
###241 credit of the University and the Ruckelshaus Institute and the group including
###245 Al and John and and others, Craig Thomas who, who helped start it, uh,
###253 we decided to start a a group to try to focus on a collaborative
###258 process and bring together a number of advisory boards members who could
###263 provide some expertise not only in the uh process but in various issues
###269 and act as a forum to help resolve issues.  Bill Ruckelshaus, uh, generously
###277 gave this time from the beginning and, and uh we've all been very grateful
###281 for that and we're grateful for him to make the trip out here into the
###286 wilderness uh for this session today.  [Laughter.]  Uh I was thinking
###291 as Jane and I were driving in from Casper about the collaborative process
###294 and you know in today's time it seems like compromise and collaboration
###303 has taken on almost a four letter word sort of context and and that
###310 has get to be wrong.  There is no magic to the collaborative process.
###313 It's the way we get along on a daily basis and I was thinking Jane and
###318 I have been getting along for 50 years collaborating.  [Laughter]
###322 and uh so I don't know that there is a lot of magic to it but it does
###327 take patience and perseverance. And uh we have three people some
###334 have more patience than others on this panel but uh but they've certainly
###339 have been exposed to it.  So let me introduce John is a Wyoming native
###345 as most of you would know.  He is from Jackson Hole and Moose uh he
###349 is a long time rancher family ranch at Triangle X outside of Jackson
###356 and has contributed and served the public of Wyoming both within the
###363 the state legislature and the Senate.  He was president of the Senate
###367 while I was governor.  And I was please to have the the opportunity
###371 to serve with him.  Before he went uh to Washington D.C. to become
###376 director of the Fish and Wildlife Service, a place where a lot of
###380 collaboration and sensitive issues exist, uh he he then served as chairman
###388 or director of the Conservation Fund and uh left that position to become
###394 Assistant Secretary of Motions and International Environmental and
###397 Scientific Affairs which he is going to have to tell you what they do.
###403 But I can tell you they do remarkable work throughout the world with uh
###409 various sensitive subjects and fragile environments.  Uh John served 19
###417 years in the Wyoming legislature representing North Lincoln and Sublette
###422 and Teton counties where there are always controversies.  And he's
###429 remained a partner in the Triangle X Ranch, a family dude ranch and
###436 outfitting operation in Jackson.  Please welcome John Turner.
###439 [Applause]
###448 Bill Ruckelshaus.  Bill is currently strategic director of the Natrona
###453 group by way of background he was a member of the Indiana House of
###457 Representatives and its majority leader from 1967 to 69.  The president
###462 appointed him uh for the years 1969 and 1970 as assistant attorney general
###469 in charge of the Civil Division of the US department of justice and
###473 that would cover the two hours that we have here if he wanted to tell
###477 us about that.  Uh alone uh but you're not going to get a chance to do
###483 that.  [Laughing.]  He became uh the United States Environmental
###492 Protection Agency's first administrator when it was formed in December of
###497 1970 and served until 1973 and I asked him was it 3 times you were
###503 Environmental uh Protection Agency director and he said no it was only
###507 2 but he was there in in Washington so often that I thought he served
###513 under 4 or 5 presidents in that capacity.  In April of 73 he was appointed
###518 acting director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  Just to provide
###522 a little diversity to his to his interests.  And uh the same year
###526 was appointed deputy attorney general for the Department of Justice.
###530 He was pres- he was appointed by president Reagan as the 5th EPA administrator
###535 until 1985.  He's founding director and board member of the Initiative
###540 of Global Development, chairs the William D. Ruckelshaus Center at
###543 Washington State Univ- University.  And I suspect that there are five
###551 or ten other very high profile environmental uh study groups and others including
###558 one you were telling me about about ocean acidification in Washington
###562 that Bill has been chosen and acts as chairman or a member because
###568 of the great contribution he brings to those groups.  He's also a probably
###573 this is the most sterling of his uh resume he's a board emeritus
###578 member of the World Research Institute and the University of Wyoming Ruckelshaus
###581 Institute.  [Laughter.] Please welcome Bill Ruckelshaus.
###585 [Applause.]
###594 Alan K. something something. [Laughter.]  What can I say that
###599 hasn't been said?  Alan served 14 years, was it, in then 13 years
###611 in the Wyoming legislature.  Uh the first time as a very baby lawyer
###616 that I ever approached legislature for anything Al took me under his
###619 wing and I've been grateful and indebted to him ever since.  He served from
###626 1979 to 1997 as United States senator from Wyoming.  He was most recently
###633 appointed in 2010 to co-chair President Obama's National Commission on Fiscal
###639 Responsibility and Reform.  Which was a small little job he was asked
###644 to do and uh he he he built it into a really big thing.  [Laughter.]
###653 And uh and we're all the better for his having undertaken that uh
###661 position.  He taught at the Shorenstein Center on press politics and public
###667 policy at Harvard University and served at the John F. Kennedy School
###671 of Government in Cambridge, Massachusetts the direct as director of the institute
###676 politics where he inoculated the Harvard campus with his own western
###683 wit and personality.  And I don't know whether you've noticed but
###687 it's never been the same since. [Laughter.]  He teaches periodically
###692 at the University of Wyoming and spends a good deal of time promoting
###696 the University and Wyoming throughout the country.  He is a Cody boy.
###704 Please welcome Alan Simpson.
###706 [Applause.]
###716 I am going to ask Bill Ruckelshaus to start and just give a a short
###717 overview of your experience with collaborative process
###726 Bill Ruckelshaus I  think it's as good as uh jumping on
###729 point point as any to describe what collaborative processes are all about.
###734 And why universities could be the center for a place like the Institute. uh As you all know
###743 we've had trouble in this country over the last couple of decades
###746 in arriving at decisions.  Uh the level of civil discourse particularly
###753 at the national level has not been very high or edifying.  And it gets
###757 in the way uh uh I think of rational address to our nation's problems.
###764 So we can bring our hands about that and say what caused it, what
###768 can we do about it, why don't people treat one another better, but it's more
###772 helpful I think to talk about that kind of problem within the context
###777 of a of a solution to a multi interest multi party type of problem.  Which
###784 collaborative processes really work pretty well for.  Uh use of collaboration
###790 to make decisions is not a new thing in this country.  We have uh in
###796 Jeffersonian days uh farm raising exercises and neighbors helping
###801 neighbors uh solve their own problems.  And we were as a nation kind of
###805 founded on that. But one of the problems with collaborative issues have
###810 today is they compete very strongly for the judiciary, executive, legislative
###817 branches of decision making.  Which some of this uh lack of civil discourse
###823 lack of harmony exists today and it's sometimes hard for these collaborative
###829 processes to break through because they're dealing with uh dispute
###834 resolution institutions that are lodged in our constitution.  And it is
###839 trying there.  And there are automatic sources of funding for these cat
###844 these ways of resolving societal disputes. Well one of the ways
###849 of of of avoiding that is to simply let universities with their enormous
###855 capacity for uh for knowledge for the generation of knowledge for
###862 the uh taking that knowledge and applying it to the social problems
###865 uh and providing a readout where people can come together around
###871 their problems and sit at the same table and listen to one another.
###874 This uh when Alan, it's really Alan's fault that I got involved in the University
###880 of Washington, uh Wyoming, sorry, it wasn't your fault and asked me
###888 to come and and help the University try to sort out what they could
###893 do to make a significant impact on natural resource kind of issues.
###897 Well we spent a couple of weekends at it with a very distinguished
###901 board, several of whom are here in this audience, uh and to try to
###906 figure out what we could do that would be helpful for Wyoming in
###914 trying to resolve some of their natural resources disputes. And so what
###914 we decided was the University is a very good place to have people
###918 gather to come uh in Wyoming, almost literally lay their guns down at
###923 the door and come in and talk to one another.
###925 Male Speaker: Not anymore!
###927 Bill Ruckelshaus and and really listen to one another as they discuss
###931 what a problem looked like from their perspective.  And collaborative
###937 processes give people an opportunity to not only talk to one another
###942 in a civil way but to listen and once that once that trust builds
###948 up within one of these collaborative processes.  So that people began
###953 to talk and listen to one another real progress starts to be made.
###956 And universities are a wonderful place to make that happen.  They
###961 have research capacities, they have the teaching uh responsibilities,
###965 and they have outreach, particularly in land grant colleges like Wyoming
###968 have uh have uh have have uh an obligation to reach out into the community
###975 and try to help help resolve disputes. All of these things are involved
###979 in collaborative process.  The faculty can be made available to help resolve
###985 difficult scientific questions, uh they can use the students and graduate
###992 students as uh uh as helpers in trying to gather information.  In fact
###997 that will inform the discussion but then they provide this uh uh literally
###1003 an arena where people can come together and talk to one another in a civil way.
###1007 Out of that if they're properly structured, if they're properly
###1011 sponsored by the government or the governor and legislatures and if
###1015 the people themselves are desirous of coming to a harmonized solution
###1020 to their problems enormous progress can be made.  And and issues that
###1026 just seemed intractable and been around for decades can be solved.
###1029 We have any number of them in the state of Wyoming as well as other
###1033 states where institutes like this have been created over the last
###1037 few decades. So collaborative processes hold great promise I think
###1041 for trying to get uh at disputes that seem intractable uh and at
###1048 the same time allow us to to come to a conclusion that is durable
###1052 primarily because it is one that satisfies all the people around
###1057 the table they know they've had a chance to be heard.  They know their
###1060 interests have been taken into account.  They figured out how to harmonize
###1064 harmonize their interest with those of the rest of the people at the
###1068 table.  So when you get a solution out of one of these processes, it
###1072 is a lot more durable than one where you end up with a corner of the
###1076 legislature where they can be overturned by such and such proceeding.  That's
###1082 seemed way too detailed a fashion to do what you asked.
###1086 Mike Sullivan    I'll uh uh let me just ask you.
###1089 because you're most recent work on the National Commission for Fiscal Responsibility
###1094 which might be viewed as a collaborative process by some.  [Laughter.]
###1101 Uh how would you characterize the tenor  of the current public debate
###1105 and what does it say about the need or the uh inability to have collaborative processes?
###1113 Alan Simpson Well first let <font color="#FFFFFF"><b>me uh,</b></font>
###1115 Mike Sullivan Turn your microphone on?
###1117 Alan Simpson Yes, I uh I see that I've fouled it up.
###1119 Mike Sullivan Here. [Laughter]
###1120 Bill Ruckelshaus There's a screw loose
###1121 Mike Sullivan let me work on it.
###1123 Alan Simpson Oh I have it I have it now.
###1127 [Laughter]
###1130 Mike Sullivan Well Alan it's called a switch!
###1130 [Laughter]
###1133 Alan Simpson I don't have to take that! [Laughter]
###1134 Just quickly, I served in the legislature with this delightful man and we
###1141 he put a bill in to do conservation easements.  Let me tell you that
###1147 was back in the 70s.  You think that was popular you're goofy.  And we
###1152 lost that by one vote.  They thought I was a commie after I finished that.
###1155 [Laughter]
###1157 Uh, but my training came,  I'll answer your question,
###1159 I was on the Park County Zoning and Planning Commission in the 60s.
###1164 So I know what hell is from the origins of hell.  We were saying
###1171 "if you want to have a two story purple outhouse on your property,
###1174 by God it's America!"  " You will have have a two story outhouse...." well
###1180 I said go ahead but the neighbors might not go for that. Anyway.
###1183 I really came out of that one painted red. This guy comes to Washington
###1189 with a sense of humor. In doing the most unbelievable mess of things
###1195 and I was on the Environmental Public Works Committee and all I came away
###1199 from was admiration for a guy who could take more flak by the ton
###1204 and keep smiling with a great sense of humor. And this young man
###1210 was in the the he represented uh a client who was being seriously
###1214 abused by the Union Pacific Railroad.  And Ed Herschler, a Democrat, and Hellbaum, and
###1220 myself with the council of this young lawyer took on the Union Pacific
###1225 and smashed them flat. Don't forget the statue books were set up so
###1231 the Union Pacific could put a depot in your living room!
###1235 Because they got twenty miles on each side of the track and inter lacking
###1240 minerals and surface.  And they were crowding out the Trona industry.
###1244 So I'm always I dunno, I'm perverse.  It's obvious that I am, but back
###1252 to your question.  The president wanted us as co-chairs, we went
###1259 to see him which says everything on the table, he says yes, everything,
###1263 including your Obama-care, yep, he took our commission in and told
###1268 us the same thing. And uh we came out after 8 months with 5 Democrats
###1274 and 5 republicans and 1 independent voting for a package which is tough.
###1280 And real and it's about math.  It's not about emotion. And senior
###1286 citizens breaking the bed pans in the hospices and cheating the veterans
###1290 and all this junk that you get out of em. And social security, how
###1295 could you ever change retirement age to 68 by the year 2050, how
###1301 will seniors ever be able to, and I said, you can figure it out somehow.
###1305 Anyway. I'm getting a lot of trouble that way and uh so for the first
###1310 3 months we didn't even have any trust. I was on the Iraq study
###1315 group. There was no trust in the beginning. That was Jim Baker and
###1319 Lee Hamil. So finally Herst and I said we'll just do a 2 person
###1323 report, we don't care if you join or not. Because the first all of
###1328 this stuff, the first few months they say, who is the biggest spending
###1331 president in the history of the United States before this one. The answer?
###1335 George W. Bush. Never voted a single spending billion six and a half years.
###1340 So that would light up the fire but then they'd say this
###1343 guy has 3 times worse, car, stimulus, I mean, 3 months, finally we said,
###1349 we don't give a damn how we got here it's what do we do now.  This trajectory
###1355 of debt deficit interest is on the same course as Portugal, Spain, Ireland all
###1360 the rest except we are bigger.  So we began to talk. If you can imagine
###1366 there was a congresswoman named Jan Shakowski, Illinois, man oh man
###1371 I can tell you she's tough.  And she just raised hell. But she we
###1378 said, well, then what's your plan, she said, I'll do one, I'll give you
###1381 a plan. It wasn't something we accepted, but, if you're going to be in the
###1385 game you don't just sit and bitch.  Put your plan on the table. Don't
###1389 just sit and say, I compromise is a four letter word. In fact, in
###1395 fact the speaker said when I asked him about compromise, he said, I
###1400 don't know that word.  And McConnel doesn't know that word, and Harry
###1404 Reed doesn't know that word, and Pelosi doesn't know that word.
###1408 But it won't make any difference when the markets pull the chain
###1410 on us.  They don't give a damn who's running the country, they just want
###1413 their money.  They want more interest for their money when they see a
###1418 dysfunctional government.  So it's sad to watch, it's more bitter than
###1421 I've ever seen, breaks your heart, Ted Kennedy and I used to work together
###1426 on immigration and other issues, uh I didn't care what he did or
###1431 how he lived, but he never broke his promise to me ever, and that's
###1435 one tough guy.  Never broke his word to me.  But we used to just scrap,
###1439 knock each other out, it was fun, I loved it. Anyway it's uh, we're headed
###1446 for deep stuff and and and uh I don't see any prospect of any kind of
###1453 cooperation before the election, and between November 6 and December
###1457 31 hang on to your shorts.  Cause it's going to be a blood bath of
###1462 5 to 7 trillion bucks rolling around.  If you go too far one way it's
###1467 a recession.  And if you do too little it's a recession.  We'll see what
###1471 happens.  But you've got to keep your sense of humor.  I try to do
###1475 that.  My mother said that humor is the universal solvent against
###1479 the abrasive elements of life.  The other one is the definition of politics,
###1485 and here it is, very short: in politics there are no right answers, only
###1490 a continual flow of compromises among groups resulting in a changing cloudy
###1496 and ambiguous series of public decisions, where appetite and ambition compete
###1502 openly with knowledge and wisdom. [Laughter]
###1508 Tears are streaming down your cheeks! [Laughter]
###1512 Male Speaker That's too profound for me! [Laughter]
###1514 Mike Sullivan Let me just ask John. Uh you were
###1522 you were director of fish and wildlife  during uh spotted owl and reintroduction
###1527 of the wolf and a number of other issues that you can remember better than I can.
###1533 Uh where do you think the collaborative  process comes in and what issues
###1538 does it particularly lend itself to?
###1540 John Turner well thank you mike, and uh what
###1544 a pleasure to join you all.  These, literally, 3 giants up here, and
###1548 I want to thank you all for joining us today, taking part of your time
###1552 uh I'm really proud as hopefully all of you who live in Wyoming with
###1557 what's going on in Laramie uh these days.  Dr. Burke and her staff,
###1562 uh the University of Wyoming is really a great university in many respects
###1568 and one of them is in  the arena of natural resources. Uh thanks
###1573 to the gentlemen here and many others what's going on in the Ruckelshaus
###1576 Institute is uh really an example of excellence for the mountain west
###1581 and for the for entire country how we can come together and build information,
###1585 find common ground, solutions to some pretty thorny issues.  Uh a
###1591 superb school of natural resources, a wonderful conservation corps working
###1595 across the state, and now uh uh the Barry Center on uh Biodiversity
###1601 just has great promise for Wyoming and the future of the West.  Uh.
###1607 President Bush honored me by asking me to join the US Fish and Wildlife
###1614 Service uh in 1990.  And uh that was literally the best job in Washington.
###1621 But I was, uh, a foot taller and a head of hair I think that's I think that's
###1626 a Simpson Simpsonite.  But before I got into the Fish and Wildlife
###1630 Service mostly because of endangered species and uh the wetlands and
###1635 a few others, I can recall uh going to Shirley Basin to reintroduce
###1640 uh the black footed ferret which Jack they found here in Meeteetse,
###1645 uh the rarest mammal in the world, we were down to 18 animals and decided
###1650 to roll the dice and look for a place for re-introduction in the Shirley
###1654 Basin and the ranchers there on private land agreed to work with us to allow
###1661 us to reintroduce uh the black footed ferret. Um and I asked one of
###1668 the ranchers, I remember we were up there to release the first ferrets,
###1671 pickups going everywhere, and private leaving gates open and dust and
###1675 biologists setting up all kinds of crap and I said, why are you letting
###1678 us do this?  Here is the most rarest and endangered mammal on the planet
###1683 and you're allowing us to put it right in the middle of your operation.
###1687 He said, well gosh, it's a part of Wyoming landscape and it's kind
###1691 of exciting just don't tell our friends at the Wyoming stock growers we're
###1695 doing this cause of the spotted owl, the wolf reintroduction, uh I might
###1702 make a few comments on wolf reintroduction because Al's here and his memory's
###1707 pretty ripe on this one.  Uh wolf reintroduction was a national uh interest of course
###1713 for decades uh to bring wolves back to Yellowstone landscape and uh
###1719 myself and a few others had the audacity to think we could come up with a
###1723 plan which would meet the interests of the western states, the cattlemen,
###1726 the sportsmen, as well as the national interest and so working with Alan and
###1731 I'm sure he regrets to this day and Malcolm Wall and Conrad Burns and
###1736 Jim McClure, Larry Craig some pretty tough hombres, we made, we put together a group, call it
###1745 a collaborative effort.  Uh we had ranchers, we had wool growers, we
###1749 had uh, local officials, we had people from game and fish agencies in a
###1756 three state region, we had conservationists, wildlife groups, and we put together
###1762 a a pledge, a plan and a pledge, to Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho that
###1768 we would reintroduce the wolves, which we did, 31 of them into Yellowstone
###1773 Park.  Uh and also some in Idaho.  We made the pledge uh at the threshold
###1777 would be 10 breeding pair in each state.  Uh 10 breeding units in
###1782 Idaho, Montana.  And once that happened, then we would turn jurisdiction back
###1788 to the states.  Uh and that we would make a compact with the ranchers
###1794 and the livestock owners the big game interests that when wolves
###1799 misbehaved they would be managed but they would be off limits and
###1805 I uh so it was this successful collaborative effort where the western congressional
###1811 delegations were not happy about this.  But it sounds like as good
###1817 a deal as fair a deal for the western states and the national interest.
###1820 And I regret to this day we have never kept the promise to the people
###1825 of Wyoming and Idaho and Utah.  Uh it's great to have wolves back
###1830 as part of this landscape but by Wyoming law we have almost 30 breeding
###1834 pair now and 3 times the promise pacts I think were close to 50 pacts,
###1840 in Wyoming uh a lot of people don't want to recognize that government agents
###1845 have killed 1700 wolves since they were introduced. Why should the
###1851 tax payers be these conscientious agents trying to take of problem wolves.
###1856 So unfortunately, the people that bought into that collaborative effort
###1861 to get it done was successful but the final outcome where we had I'm
###1866 sure well intended but misguided activists and activist judges which keep moving
###1870 moving the goal post and uh certain groups that want to litigate and
###1878 so forth.  But I think uh the US Fish and Wildlife Service tried
###1883 to down this wolf since 2002 and of course that's been for the
###1888 court and we'll try again this fall with a compromise that uh the federal
###1894 government, Governor Mead, and others have tried to put together, uh I think
###1900 there's already been court filings uh there already been court filings
###1906 before Fish and Wildlife interiors even publish the rules for this
###1910 fall.  But it's unfortunate we did not keep our pledge to the West
###1914 uh to the western states.  The people, I got off a plane about a few years
###1921 ago, here in Cody.  Ran into a very prominent lady I won't use here name, I promise
###1926 a very intelligent businesswoman I've been friends with, saw her
###1930 in the airport, went to give her a hug, she just shaken me she backed
###1934 away from me, and she said, John, I can never forgive you for what
###1938 you did. I said, What? What are we talking about, she says, your intr -  reintroduction
###1943 of wolves into Yellowstone. I love Yellowstone park. I go there every
###1948 year with my kids and my grandkids I can never go back to Yellowstone
###1953 because of what you've done.  Now you can say, well that's a little
###1957 unreal, but people around the country, you all do understand the passion
###1961 with wolves. The years in the legislature, I saw a grown man stand
###1967 up and break into tears on 2 issues of my 19 year one of course is abortion
###1972 the other was wolves.  So we're not there yet on wolves, and, um, I'm
###1980 sure Alan would have quite a few comments on them.  Northern spotted
###1982 owl probably biggest endangered species issue facing the country.  Prior
###1987 was salmon, uh, Pacific salmon, involved 3 states, uh about 12 million acres,
###1994 we established critical habitat on 7 million.  The entire northwest
###1998 was fearful, people's jobs, just wanted to pay off their mortgage,
###2002 send their kids to school, uh I think we found good middle ground uh on
###2008 science uh to try to help communities for the unemployment issues, but
###2016 spotted owls was another tough one.  We did that have a lot of collaborative
###2020 efforts, timber companies, communities, and uh the three states.
###2028 Mike Sullivan What what kind of natural resource issues
###2031 in the West are not suitable for the collaborative process?
###2036 Bill Ruckelshaus It's an important, uh uh, thank
###2040 you Mike for asking that because that's an important thing to remember.
###2042 All issues can't be solved by a collaborative process.  They're
###2048 not suited for it.  Uh but and all issues that for which collaborative processes
###2054 are suited aren't always solved that way because all these processes
###2059 don't work.  Sometimes people don't participate in them and they don't
###2064 really participate in good faith.  They want to blow them up and if
###2066 somebody's determined to that you can usually blow them.  But the
###2070 the best way from my standpoint to think about it, areas in which these
###2075 collaborative processes work well are sort of place based uh issues.
###2080 And they that sort of defines a lot of natural resource problems.
###2084 Uh, for instance in a watershed you have a lot of different claimants
###2090 for the use of water.  Uh ranging from wildlife habitat, to fish habitat,
###2095 to irrigation, to uh recreation.  Uh drinking water supply, the conditions
###2104 of water quality.  Those issues can provide people and just proper water
###2109 rights that are so well known in the West, as very emotional issues.
###2114 Those kinds of water related and watershed place based kind of problems,
###2120 if you get everybody at the table and open their minds and get them willing
###2124 to talk to one another it's amazing how much progress can be made.
###2128 We have an situation in Puget Sound, where I now live, and uh a watershed,
###2134 and there just huge fights over salmon, which are listed as endangered in
###2140 Puget Sound, and which, so it is a problem of habitat, where those
###2145 fish normally would spawn and breed and where this uh smolts would uh would originate.
###2152 There are huge fights over these questions.  And there are 14 major
###2159 watersheds in Puget Sound.  In 3 of them there have been collaborative
###2164 processes, one of which has gone over 20 years, where the people
###2168 are all together.  They have managed to sit down and talk through all
###2172 their desires for the uses of the water in that sound.  That's where
###2176 Mountaineer is located, Ft. Lewis is there, there are a lot of small
###2179 towns, there is an Indian reservation on the edge of the Squalee River,
###2184 that's the river where this uh collaborative process has been working.  All of
###2188 these people have worked out their their their interests and have managed
###2194 to harmonize them.  And they got more money, and this may not make
###2198 everybody in Wyoming happy, but they got more money in the stimulus program
###2202 than all the rest of the watersheds in Puget Sound put together.
###2205 For 2 reasons: they had a plan that they all agreed to, and they all
###2209 went forward and tried to raise money on it uh from first the federal
###2213 government and anyplace else they could find it.  They have made enormous
###2217 progress in that watershed. They have, they've worked out all their problems themselves
###2222 and they all think of the watershed as their place.  That's where they
###2226 live and that's where their children are going to grow up, and uh
###2232 they they find it enormously uh rewarding that they have been able to come
###2237 together. And it's primarily because a farmer who was a leading citizen
###2242 in the watershed and an Indian chief named Billy Frank shook hands and
###2246 said, we've got to stop fighting and stop going to court stop going to the
###2250 legislature trying to get our way and figure out how to harmonize our interest and they've
###2254 done it.  It is it's a marvelous place to visit because you know almost the
###2258 minute you come into that watershed the people there are all on the same page
###2262 pulling in the same direction.
###2265 John Turner it, it isn't going to work if the
###2269 key players won't sit at the table.  They figure there's uh either they
###2273 can force something that they want important in their own means or the objectives
###2279 they think they can get in an arena  Or I think there are some issues
###2284 that are over ripe.  They've been worked so much and people have beaten
###2288 the tar out of each other so long and it's been in the papers so long that
###2291 that trying to find common ground might be difficult.
###2296 Alan Simpson  My, in my, I think I'm correct that
###2299 Montana has not yet done a wilderness bill nor Idaho?  But Wyoming did.
###2305 And Herschler was governor.  Malcom and I and Dick Cheney
###2308 were in the house and in the Senate and and John Cyberling
###2314 was the chair of the house committee and he wanted to put he had a staff
###2318 member who wanted to rise every morning at uh face east and transform himself
###2324 into some kind of Zeus or something.  I never did figure out what the
###2328 hell the guy was doing, but he wanted to set the whole state of Wyoming
###2331 into wilderness.  So we put a bill to make a city park in Cleveland
###2335 a wilderness, and Cyberling then came over to visit and we began
###2341 to talk.  And then the enviros came and and there was never enough but
###2348 we need another 285 thousand acres, or we need an so finally Malcom
###2353 and I and Herschler and Dick got a big map and we said, bring us
###2358 a Crayola.  A big 'ol black Crayola.  And we said, how many more acres
###2364 you want? I mean cause you're not getting out of this room and playing this
###2368 game where you get it and then you go and give it again and then you
###2371 go to court. So they said well we need a hundred and whatever it was
###2377 so Herschler looked at it is said, well we need something down there
###2380 in the southwest down there around Fontanel he drew a
###2383 little picture and had acres in it.
###2384 Cheney said, well back there behind Hogadon, we like that up there.
###2389 That would look good up there. Malcolm said, oh I've been waiting
###2392 for that around Cloud Peak, we'll just, hell I said, well
###2395 Bob Cat Crick we'll just run something back over the ridge there.  And
###2399 we did and they said, well, they, and we said, well isn't they the
###2405 acreage you wanted, they says, well yeah, but we have to talk to our
###2407 people.  We said, no.  This is it.  You've been hanging around like
###2411 poor relatives and now that's it.  [Laughter.]  And so we sent it up
###2416 to the President and I to show how retractable it is, I believe if
###2422 I'm not mistaken that Steve Sims and and Church even tried to do
###2427 it.  Conrad and Locke has tried to do it.  In other words, efforts
###2432 between Democrats and Republicans always cremated by these ropes that
###2437 are demanding more and more and more. It's unbelievable. So I think I'm correct
###2441 maybe somebody can correct me but I don't think either of
###2445 those two states, and don't forget  Wyoming leaving off Alaska, the lower 48,
###2451 Wyoming provides 44% of the nation's wilderness.  It's like I said we
###2457 gave at the office.  [Laughter]
###2462 Mike Sullivan Well, what a day, I think
###2465 what you're saying is that there are issues where because of the
###2469 demands of one group or another you can never reach the harmony that
###2474 Bill talks about.  One of the one of the questions that occurred to
###2479 me today was, and I think it may be why we can't go anywhere on health
###2484 care, nat- nationwide with regard to the parameters yes or no politics
###2490 on that but, has it been your experience that when you have an issue that
###2496 there is a large group that  wants the status quo?
###2501 Bill Ruckelshaus They're they're not going to negotiate
###2504 good faith, one of the things you have to do before you, Alan Alan's decision
###2510 is an example of place based. Example except pl- space was unlimited.  That's no definition
###2518 of the space. There's no watershed.  No place that they could identify
###2521 with as their place.  And and so it is important to be able to put
###2528 some boundaries on what they uh what was they're discussing in order
###2532 for these collaborative processes to work.  Uh and you I I have believed
###2538 for years, in fact we suggested this to the congress on environmental
###2542 issues, that they should try to get the before introducing a bill a
###2548 member of the committee should try to get the relevant players around
###2551 the table and say, okay, we're going to work this out, much the way Alan
###2554 just described in the wilderness situation.  And here the criteria
###2557 we are going to use is we need an agreement and if we don't get an
###2561 agreement out of all of you it will be balance because of the balanced group we are
###2565 going to go ahead anyway.  So it forces a decision for a certain period
###2569 of time it is a form of collaborative process.  There's more force associated
###2575 with it.  It won't change the decision of the process itself is normal but if you
###2583 don't have everybody collaborating and somebody says the status quo
###2586 is fine they're not a player.  Before you start one of these processes,
###2591 what you have to do whether it is a university Wyoming or Washington
###2595 or any other university or place where this is going to happen.
###2597 You have to do an assessment.  You have to go out and talk to all of
###2601 the people that are going to be involved and say, are you going to play?
###2604 Are you willing to try best you can to harmonize your interests
###2608 with that of others at the table?  And if they say, no, I can get
###2612 a better deal in the legislature or the courts or the status quo
###2615 is fine with me, then you don't have a a a requisite agreement to try
###2621 to work things out with a proper group.
###2623 Alan Simpson   Think of it this way.
###2626 You've got uh the situation, now, 83 guys in the house, and gals,
###2631 they didn't go there to limit government, they went there to stop government.
###2636 Well how the hell do you start anything when you've got 83 people rock bound
###2642 that want to stop government?  Merry Christmas! [Laughter]
###2646 Mike Sulivan John?
###2651 John Turner I think the uh idea of rightness
###2654 is is there is some merit to it.  I recall in the legislature Alan
###2659 mentioned the open space easement gives land  owners another tool at auction where their property
###2666 rights uh when we put that in it was the agriculture interest, a few others
###2671 that helped do us in.  Then we came up with an idea called the Wildlife
###2675 Trust Fund that uh the two of you remember where were going to take mineral
###2680 proceeds create a 5 to 250 million dollars to compensate Wyoming ranchers to
###2686 uh to keep the land private property but uh to provide easements. Again
###2691 it was the Ag interests and we've talked a lot about it
###2694 recently with some of their leaders about how they helped throughout
###2698 that and we lost it by one vote in two sessions.  Wyoming in my opinion
###2702 has an opportunity that no other state has to protect its wildlife,
###2707 resources, its open space, its critical watersheds, its tradition of agriculture
###2712 in a way that no other state can cause both states have screwed it
###2715 up and lost it and they're spending billions to protect remnants where
###2719 Wyoming can really mold their landscapes and partnership with the land owners.
###2724 Well now that has all changed uh the Wyoming land owners all over
###2730 the state are forming partnerships with nonprofit groups, with the
###2735 Wyoming trust fund which is now in place, the NRCS, the University
###2741 of Wyoming, it has provided data and background, and I think that
###2746 Wyoming stockholder's agriculture land trust is now protected 170,000 acres across
###2752 Wyoming on a volunteer basis. They're now the 9th largest land trust in
###2756 the United States there are 1700 of them, uh, just down here in Meeteetsee
###2761 the uh Epperson family at the Hat Two Ranch protected a huge 13,000
###2768 uh acre easement provided aquidity. Cash for future generation to help
###2774 that family to help keep ranching down at the Butt Ranch down in Sublette
###2777 County.  We just did a wonderful uh uh conservation easement deal
###2782 where they're going to buy the ranch use the proceeds to buy the ranch
###2785 next to them keep both protected and uh provide easements to help sage grouse,
###2792 winter mule deer habitat, moose habitat, so what's going on with the Wyoming
###2798 land owners now?  Using good signs for priority areas uh people bringing
###2804 their resources together part of the mineral industry has been willing
###2808 to put up money to impact to to mitigate impact in the upper Green.  So the
###2814 collaborative effort now is is really working well.  Uh and we have an
###2820 opportunity to do a lot more because I think now the timeliness is right
###2824 where Wyoming ranchers see uh an opportunity to keep lands in private
###2830 ownership to keep ranching protect public value. uh resources, so
###2835 there's great opportunity for Wyoming based on this kind of collaborative effort
###2839 
###2842 Mike Sullivan And so many of these issues where there
###2844 isn't that self-interest and harmony from the beginning, you need to have some kind
###2851 of a hammer that provides that self interest.  And it seems to me in many cases
###2858 that's leadership.  Whether it's the Senate committee that says,
###2863 we're going to do something.  We prefer you do it collaboratively,
###2867 but if you don't do it we're going to do it.  Or a governor who says,
###2871 this is an issue and we're going to take care of it.  But as we see
###2877 in today's political world, so many of the leaders, as Al mentioned,
###2884 and as we see the elections coming up even, uh the executive uh nominees,
###2892 are going to come in with an unwillingness to talk about compromise.  Or collaboration.
###2900 How do you get the leadership into a collaborative attitude in order
###2907 to move some of these intractable issues off the status quo or off
###2912 of the self-interest issues and into an area where you can have
###2917 some kind of harmonization of the interests?
###2923 Bill Ruckelshaus If I could answer that question
###2927 we wouldn't need to have  a presidential election.
###2929 How do you get leaders to be leaders?  If leadership is defined as no
###2936 give, no compromise, no backing away from the principle, we ought to
###2942 have principles that guide our conduct but principles don't say you can
###2945 never compromise in order to achieve a greater approximation toward whatever
###2950 principle you're trying to preserve.  It may be necessary to compromise
###2954 to get there.  And it is clearly true when these collaborative processes
###2958 work it is because leaders in the various among the various interest
###2962 groups that are being represented at the table come forward and exercise
###2967 leadership.  One of the things they have to do is go back and talk to
###2971 the people.  If they're representing an environmental group, or ranchers,
###2974 or whoever it is that that is part of their uh contingent, they can't
###2980 just go in there and represent themselves.  They have to go in there and talk
###2983 to their groups and say, here's where we are, what do you think?  And
###2987 then exercise some persuasiveness and leadership among their own group
###2991 to get them to move forward toward a compromise that will give most
###2996 people most of what they want.  If somebody comes out with everything
###3000 they want then probably somebody else got nothing.  So you're going
###3004 to need to have a willingness to compromise when those groups come
###3008 together.  But those leaders have to usually emerge during the discussion
###3013 of the collaboration itself.  And it's not somebody running for presidential
###3017 office it's somebody who is very unlikely.  They just happened to
###3021 be someone with an interest that uh they have been imaginative enough
###3026 to figure out how they can harmonize with somebody else's interest.
###3029 Alan Simpson I think a a remarkable thing is the existence of this thing for
###3036 18 years.  Uh there were people of all stripes who were terribly terribly
###3043 concerned about hearing about this operation starting up.  You remember
###3049 that?  I do.  Big time.  Well, and it came from, it, I wouldn't even
###3054 name one, all of them were concerned, what are they going to do uh they're
###3059 going to mess around and uh they're going to get into land use again
###3062 and they're going to get into this and this and water use and all the
###3065 things that create high high passion in Wyoming.  So bad that a member
###3072 of I think they had an oversight outfit in the legislature, our budget
###3077 was 5 million bucks out of you know, I don't know what the hell it was,
###3082 a billion and a half or whatever, and wanted an investigation of this
###3087 group and put it in the law.  Now that's how fun and games this was
###3092 when it started.  It's been there for 18 years.  Let me tell you.
###3096 I dealt with people like Robert Birds, George Mitchell, Al Cranston,
###3102 Democrats of the first order, and George Mitchell, you remember, Bill,
###3106 put us all in a room, Democrats and Republicans, and he said, we're
###3110 going to do a clean air act.  And we're going to do that, we have
###3114 a conference and he brought in everybody one after the other.  What great
###3120 patience, it takes tremendous patience, I do not have that.  I never have
###3124 had.  I'll eventually get my foot in it without question but I'll
###3128 stick around.  I've never given anybody the ice treatment.  That's the worse
###3133 thing of all time.  You give the other side the ice treatment, I'm
###3137 not talking to you, it's a good way to destroy marriages, it's a good
###3141 way to destroy anything, destroy nations, I used to say to Cheney,
###3145 why the hell don't you talk to North Korea and Iran?  Well we don't talk
###3148 to Iran.  Well I says we won't have anybody left!  [Laughter]
###3152 And then Dick is a chum of the ages.  He's just one of the dearest guys
###3156 I have.  Of course they then chose the demonize him, sadly enough,
###3161 cause he's just he's just he's right.  And that's my personal opinion.
###3165 But.  Never the less.  Madness.  To see to see the uh uh uh came
###3173 out of came out of that hearing one night, or the uh conference, and
###3179 there were a bunch of guys, all environmentalists, sitting around like they were sitting
###3183 around the fire if there had been a fire.  And I says, what are you
###3187 guys doing out here?  Well we're figuring out how to beat Chafee
###3191 and Mitchell in the next election.  I say, you people are stupid.
###3196 If you didn't have Mitchell and Chafee a Democrat and a Republican to do
###3201 the thoughtful patent work, you're going to get something rammed into
###3205 you, that you won't even know what it looks like.  I mean, uh, you
###3209 know, this delisting issue, I have a word for those people out there.
###3214 Keep your word.  I voted for the delist, I voted for the grizzlies,
###3219 and I voted for the wolves on the basis that when that population
###3224 of grizzlies reached 664, that would be it and it would go into another
###3229 plan.  The minute it hit there, it went to court.  That second.
###3233 I don't like that at all.  It's called lying.  And then the other one was
###3239 get to a certain breeding pair, wolves in this and this and we'll say that's
###3243 it.  Principle prey base of wolves is is an ungulate.  They'll eat
###3249 60 ungulates a year, a breeding pair.  Well how many breeding pairs?
###3252 I listed all that, I bought that,  Now, here we go. The minute that
###3258 hits, I talked to Malloy, not even a hair  before I said, you're as ornery as I am,
###3262 the judge.  He said, I know, but I'm as ornery on both sides.  And
###3266 he is.  That's good.  But never the less, keep your word.  You can't
###3271 have anything collaborative or honest or anything unless you keep your
###3276 word.  I don't like people who don't keep their word and I can identify
###3280 their organizations.  I'll still go talk to them, but I'll ram it
###3285 right in their nose, too!
###3288 Mike Sullivan something about the Gazoo, is....
###3291 Bill Ruckelshaus Let me make one point, cause Alan mentioned there was some concern
###3295 when the University of Wyoming started this effort to encourage collaboration
###3299 in the state to resolve some of these issues.  The university's role is
###3303 not to solve the problem.  The university's role is to cre- to create a a center
###3309 where people can come and resolve their own differences.  They can
###3313 provide facilitation, they can provide knowledge, they can provide scientific
###3317 information that will help inform the discussion, but the university
###3322 itself is not uh is using them as a center for helping and facilitating
###3329 collaboration doesn't solve the problem.  I mean if the university comes
###3334 down on one side or the other on one of these issues officially as
###3337 the university, they get into a huge big controversy and become less
###3341 successful as the university itself.  But as a neutral form where people
###3347 can come together and solve their own disputes and then the university
###3350 steps back and stays out of it, they perform a very useful function for the state.
###3355 Mike Sullivan So how would you say you get leaders
###3360 into the collaborative process, or use the authority of leadership to get others
###3365 into the collaborative process?
###3368 John Turner Well, I think it stops it
###3371 starts with trying trying to be a good listener.  Trying to be humble,
###3377 trying to gather information, try to find people on all sides of the
###3383 issue who have a genuine interest in a solution.  Um, I think today
###3391 as we look a lot of the resource use Alan commented on the legislative
###3395 process, uh, I don't know if I can offer a lot there.  But it seems
###3399 like what brings people today together is maybe a hammer.  It is a regulatory
###3407 hammer hanging over people.  It might be the Endangered Species Act, it
###3412 might be 404, uh it might be the Migratory Bird Act which if anybody
###3418 reads it is a hell of a lot tougher than the Endangered Species Act,
###3422 uh so those are kind of hammers.  A land owner might say, yeah, but
###3428 there are other kinds of hammers.  It's the income tax or state tax
###3431 on my large ranch and I'm having trouble with a cash flow right now
###3435 just to pay off the pick-up and send the kids to school, uh that might
###3440 not be the hammer, but there are some things you can bring the
###3444 land owner which help make that positive center, uh, fortunately there
###3449 things in the tool kit now where we can provide a equitity cash to
###3454 a land owner, which might allow him to continue the operation.  It might
###3459 be an incentive to his kids to hang around, and so we keep our multi-generational
###3464 ranches going, and sometimes I think collaborative interests work simply
###3470 because a lot of people even on diverse sides want to do the right thing and
###3477 if they get a setting that is somewhat safe, a watering hole, where people
###3482 seem like they can be trusted, they really want to do the right thing.
###3487 There are people, there are conservation people, the land owners, people
###3490 in business, in the private sector.  Uh, if you can take away the threats
###3494 and they really want to do what's best for the land or their business
###3499 or their interests in the community.  And if you can do that with partners
###3503 in a non-threatening way that doesn't get you at the other end you haven't
###3508 given some away, uh I think it really helps the collaborative process.
###3513 Mike Sullivan Let me ask this.  Uh what in your collective
###3521 opinions, are the most sensitive environmental/ natural resources issues that we are going
###3528 to be dealing with for the next few years, and are they are they suitable
###3535 for the collaborative process?
###3536 Bill Ruckelshaus There's one that's overriding everything.
###3539 And that's the question of climate change and that is not something
###3541 of collaboration, it's a global issue.  I mean you're just kidding yourself
###3546 if you think you can get everybody sit down and work that out. Uh
###3550 uh I mentioned to you before when we started here I'm currently involved
###3553 in an ocean acidification panel in the state of Washington which is to make recommendations
###3558 on the first of October.  And part of the problem is as carbon is absorbed
###3563 by the ocean, since the Industrial Revolution really, it has been building
###3567 up and it's about 30% higher today, the carbon content of the ocean
###3572 than it was when the Industrial Revolution started.  Uh we thought this was
###3577 a great thing because it was absorbing a lot of the carbon that was being
###3580 generated by burning fossil fuels, now we see that it is causing shell
###3586 fish to have difficulty forming shells so that we've got oysters, that
###3591 are about a 175 million dollar industry in Peugeot Sound, uh a good number
###3596 of those oysters have been unable to form shells for the last five
###3599 and a half years the the native oysters grown in the hatcheries are doing just
###3604 fine because they can filter the water and they can take uh they
###3609 can provide more alkalinity for it.  But that that's just another aspect
###3614 of the same problem, of carbon coming out of the atmosphere.  What can
###3617 you do about it?  You know our our panel's supposed to make recommendations
###3622 in about 60 days and it's not clear what you can do about it.  Certainly
###3627 can't do anything about the global problem in one state.  Uh but it
###3631 is a huge problem and something we're going to have to figure out a way
###3635 to deal with.  Uh through some combination of of programs.  There's no one
###3641 magic bullet to do it by any means.  But we haven't yet gotten ourselves
###3647 in a position to uh come to grips with this issue.  Yet it's it's just
###3651 going to really coming at us like a freight train the longer we live.
###3655 John Turner I think two others that will impact the West,
###3660 certainly may not be in the realm of what Bill said on climate change but it'll
###3666 be water, the fights over water here in the West, as the West and the Southwest face
###3673 pretty severe droughts.  It's how our water comes off in the spring and
###3677 Ranchers versus fish versus cities and it'll be Wyoming against the downstream
###3683 states.  And uh the second issue might be sustainability.  Uh all
###3688 of us in our personal lives, our business lives, our communities,
###3691 how are we utilizing resources, how uh much waste are we generating, how
###3696 do we use energy, uh how do we use water.  Uh are we good stewards for the
###3702 resources of this country's been blessed with.  And under the rubric
###3706 of sustainability certainly around the world the access to fresh water
###3710 is you know, 2 billion people don't have access to fresh water.  A child
###3715 dies every 15, 20 seconds from water born disease.  I think we have to
###3720 be conscious of this.  2 billion people don't have access to just
###3723 basic energy, you're not going to have environmental protection or
###3727 education or good health care or economic development, jobs, if you
###3731 don't have access to basic energy, that confronts a lot of the issues
###3735 on climate change.  So uh, I think those are some of the issues that
###3740 are going to whirl around in the days ahead.
###3742 Alan Simpson Climate change is real.
###3745 What what's causing it I I I have, I share some thoughts,
###3750 but it's there.  Let's just say it's there.  To deal with it, I don't
###3755 know how you would do it.  Another one would be in this part of the
###3758 world, fracking, fracking with regard to the oil and gas industry is going
###3763 to be a big time mess around uh for sure.  Few sheds, Um, You know.
###3771 Look at today.  We don't even, as far as I know we don't even have
###3775 a fire in Wyoming but we're getting a whole load from Idaho and Montana
###3780 and it's very limited, kind of sad.  But but that's the way that is.
###3785 The other one is the ancient stuff of water. Riparian verses appropriations
###3791 So those are real things. Air quality, uh quality
###3796 of life.  Population.  I would think we've got it figured out that that
###3801 your population has doubled since the beginning of mankind.  And ready
###3809 ready 2056, well look at those figures.  How many foot prints will fit on
###3813 the face of the earth?  But you don't hear hear some of the groups talking
###3818 about that!  That's critical.  Because, you know, some civilizations have
###3823 disappeared because they ate the last animal and took the last stick
###3827 of wood and used the last resource and they're gone.  Don't know why
###3831 they're gone, but they're gone. So those are issues that don't get
###3835 dealt with cause you're into religion, and you're into this and you're
###3839 into that, it's all shaded into 4 things that I've found in my public
###3845 life.  Emotion, fear, guilt, and racism.  And either pass or kill
###3851 or support or get rid of something using a deft blend of emotion, fear,
###3858 guilt, and racism.  It's hell of a fun place to work.  [Laughter.]
###3865 Mike Sullivan Great place to live too!
###3867 Bill Ruckelshaus Another issue that we we'll
###3870 we've got to context issue we have to think about.  I was born in 1932.
###3876 And uh when I was born we had a little over 2 billion people on
###3880 earth.  Last summer we announced that we have over 7 billion people
###3884 on earth.  We have a lot more technology than we did 80 years ago when I
###3888 was born.  We have a lot more wealth, may not feel like it, not right now in the middle of this
###3893 recession, but we have a lot more wealth globally than we had uh 80 years
###3900 ago.  And that's from the beginning of man's time on earth to 1932 we
###3904 had 2 billion people.  Just in my lifetime we have more than tripled
###3909 that.  7 billion people, more than that now, since a year and a half
###3914 has passed.  So then the real question is in thinking about these ecosystems,
###3922 a lot about which we are talking today, how how do you preserve these
###3928 ecosystems,  and these goods and services of these ecosystems, water, air,
###3933 earth, provide us, and at the same time accommodate the needs of man
###3939 and man's desire to be prosperous within that ecosystem?
###3943 Man cannot be seen as separate from the ecosystem, we are part of the ecosystem.
###3949 And if we can't figure out a way to live consistent with the other living
###3953 things that share the space of this planet with us, and and make it
###3958 as possible as we can that those other living things can prosper
###3963 as well, it is ultimately going to effect us.   So we we need to begin
###3967 to think of ourselves not as if we're going to set aside some wilderness
###3970 and never let man in there therefore it'll make a field of it, that's fine,
###3975 but by the same token we are occupying more and more of the ecosystems of
###3978 the world and we're part of it and we'ver got to figure out how
###3981 to be how how to cause man to prosper and at the same time the other living
###3985 things in that ecosystem to prosper as well.
###3989 Mike Sullivan When you have the federal government
###3993 owning more than half the land, or half the land but more than half
###3998 the minerals, how do you effectively get the federal government into
###4006 collaborative processes?
###4011 [Laughter] Come on Jump on that!
###4014 Bill Ruckelshaus The answer is leadership!  It really is!
###4017 There is no reason the people running the federal agencies that
###4020 have so much impact on the land of the West not be collaborative, not to include
###4025 the people that are going to be impacted by whatever decisions they make,
###4028 by whatever changes they make.  You've got to do that in order to get the
###4033 people to where effectively support every decision you make and if you're
###4037 not any good at that you're not any good at leadership.  You know.
###4041 It seems to me that it's absolutely necessary that part of the federal
###4045 official's responsibilities are seeing as as both listening hard to what
###4051 people say or or their intr- interests and bring those along in whatever
###4055 decisions they make so it has a chance of being durable.
###4060 John Turner I think uh sometimes almost in
###4067 the western states get a little bit of an inferiority
###4070 complex, we do too much whining.  Uh it seems like that's always good
###4074 politics. Uh. And yet I think uh with the right kind of leadership uh
###4081 from the governor's office, delegation, and uh having once been a federal
###4088 bureaucrat uh in a federal agency I think uh those agencies for the
###4094 most part have some very good people.  And if we don't start by beating
###4099 the tar out of them but working with the regional directors, working
###4103 with the secretaries, uh, on western issues.  Now, some of those are
###4108 going to be fraught with there's no way that we're going to get an
###4111 adequate solution, but I think there's a lot of examples where the people
###4116 in the West under your leadership and others, and today with Matt
###4121 Mead, the right kind of delegation, bringing in the right kind of people
###4124 with with uh our congressional delegation and so forth, uh I see a lot of
###4130 promise in the western states coming together and finding some solutions.
###4135 I see where governor Mead now heads up an eight state effort on sage grouse,
###4141 which is one of those hammers hanging over the western states, and I think
###4146 is is an opportunity where the western states can come up with a toolkit
###4149 and plan a  strategy that would be way out ahead of what the feds are
###4152 looking at.  And thus get a lot of diverse groups in behind it.
###4157 So I think there's real opportunity if the western states would whine
###4162 a little bit less, and uh thoughtfully uh approach our federal agencies
###4169 and take partners with them, the private sector and uh reasonable nonprofit
###4176 groups, I I do feel there's more middle ground than we sometimes admit.
###4181 Mike Sullivan Thank you, let me just say that
###4183 you're talking about the sage grouse.  It seems to me that is an issue that has
###4189 lent itself to collaborative processes both state and federal and it's partly
###4194 because there's such a big hammer.
###4197 Alan Simpson I think, I sense that there's more
###4200 listening and more transparency in every one of those laws that we
###4204 worked with uh when the federal government was doing something, that's
###4208 our landlord, was doing something  to the tenants.  There was a way to
###4213 the tenants to speak, uh and I think they're listening.  I think I see
###4218 that in the Shoshoni force with things of recent vintage.  I see that with
###4222 Yellowstone Park.  We held those hearings in in Wyoming and Cody.
###4227 I think what's happening, when you have one of those meetings and and
###4232 the nut job gets up and starts frothing at the mouth, people sit for a while
###4237 and then they say, why don't you shut up?  So that we can get on
###4241 with the discussion here!  That is, I I think is is happening and that
###4247 I I think is very good.  Listening takes place, and uh they all have
###4253 a process of participation.  And I think there's I think more listening
###4258 going on with what's local of course, local feeling in the Yellowstone Park.
###4262 Sylvan Pass, and ice climbing.  There's more listening.  I think that's good.
###4268 Mike Sullivan On that positive note,
###4270 We're going to open it up to questions from the audience.
###4276 Male Speaker  Tyler Krutzfelf.  I'm a Montana guy.  But on the ...
###4280 Mike Sullivan We didn't beat up on you hard enough!  [Laughter.]
###4284 Tyler Krutzfelf On the uh current topic of coal export,
###4287 which would most likely benefit Montana and Wyoming, there's a cash
###4293 being spent on both sides of that  dialogue, by the environmental
###4297 community, the face of Washington, Oregon, and the uh coal community.
###4302 Is that issue an example of uh  an uh collaborative opportunity maybe perhaps
###4311 for that policy and the Ruckelshaus Institute in  Washington state and Laramie?
###4316 Bill Ruckelshaus The coal export uh issue is is very hot
###4322 right now in the state of Washington.   Uh probably too hot to be subject to
###4328 collaboration uh Alan mentioned several hours ago, we've been speaking [Laughter], uh
###4336 Alan Simpson he didn't have a good breakfast!
###4340 [Laughter]  he's a bit testy this morning.
###4346 Bill Ruckelshaus He was, I can't even remember what
###4349 it was I was going to say.  But that that issue is probably not right, we mentioned
###4356 rightness, for collaboration because there is too much emotion involved,
###4361 particularly in the opposition to it and I think they are kind
###4364 of entrenched right now.  Over time, if it looked like some kind of export
###4371 facility moving forward then you'd get more in the
###4375 mood of beginning to discuss what form should that export take, and
###4379 how many trains should come into the state, what's going to happen
###4381 to the coal dust.  I'm mean, there's all these kinds of issues being
###4384 raised by the opposition to the export, and I don't think that as of this
###4389 juncture they would be ready to sit down with those who want to export
###4393 the coal and really work it out.  I haven't asked them that question,
###4397 so I don't know that, but what we do, and I think it the same thing
###4402 is true of Wyoming, in the state of Washington is do this assessment
###4405 ahead of time and ask every body what they think.  If they're not
###4408 willing to sit down, we recommend that they not try one of these processes.
###4411 Because they don't have a very good chance at working.
###4414 John Turner Well, it's a good question for Wyoming.
###4422 I hap I happen to be pretty strong advocate of coal and in the way of
###4428 transparency is one and it's important to the people of Wyoming. It pays
###4433 a lot of our bills, it pays for our school, it builds our hospitals,
###4437 provides money for management of natural resources.  So coal's pretty
###4440 important in the state of Wyoming, the largest coal deposit that's in
###4444 political jurisdiction in the world.  And uh helps light a lot of homes
###4450 and and provide energy for businesses and jobs across America.  So it's
###4457 important in Wyoming and I also uh serve on the Board of Directors
###4462 at Peabody Energy, the largest coal company in the world, and we're
###4466 interested in actively exporting coal.  We're the largest coal miner
###4471 in the Powder River Basin, pay a lot of taxes in Wyoming, uh, but
###4477 we're exporting Wyoming coal now, it's going in barges and we ship
###4482 from Houston and the ports.  And so uh it's going to be an active
###4487 outlet for coal from the Illinois basin, uh, some Appalachian coal,
###4493 but especially met coal used for making steel.  You have thermal
###4500 coal and met coal.  Uh if you go around the world and uh and look
###4506 at what's happening, coal's the fastest growing, uh, energy source now in
###4511 the world.  And there's a coal plant every 2 or 3 days now coming online
###4516 in India and China.  Coal is America's most abundant energy resource, so
###4523 it would seem to me rather than trying to just do coal in which a lot of
###4528 groups would like to do, and admittedly coal is at a disadvantage currently.
###4533 with the wonderful finds in natural gas that's been happening.
###4539 shale gas throughout the United States but the price of coal is depressed.
###4543 But US coal is going, if it's not burned here in the United States
###4548 it's for darned sure going to go overseas.  And if it isn't US coal,
###4553 if it isn't Wyoming coal, it'll be Indonesia coal which is poor ore,
###4557 it'll come out of Australia, South Africa, perhaps Mongolia.  So uh,
###4564 I think it's going to be an export product out of the United States,
###4569 whether it goes uh out of Washington in the Columbia River there's some
###4574 pretty advocate groups out there, uh remains to be seen.  But uh there're
###4579 terminals being built in Houston, there's current terminals there,
###4583 so uh we're going to be moving coal out of the United States in the
###4587 export market.  If not us it'll come from Columbia and other sources.
###4591 Bob Lewdel Um, John, this is a uh, a uh, this is a
###4596 uh question uh but but maybe not really a question.  Going back to
###4600 2000 you'll, Bob Lewdel, good to see you, John. You'll remember in 2000 we were in Missoula
###4609 and uh we formed uh, and you were there representing the Conservation
###4613 Fund, and we formed the American Wildlife Conservation Partners,
###4617 and we struggled for 2 days as you probably recall, and we put together
###4621 some uh 30 uh hunter conservation organizations.  Now we are 50 hunter
###4626 conservation organizations.  Uh we have provided for the uh Bush administration
###4631 uh 1 in 2 for wildlife for uh the 21st century.  Buying 1 and 2 for
###4639 Bush and buying 3 for uh the Obama Administration.  We picked out the
###4643 most important issues that faced the uh uh hunting community, the
###4648 uh, hunting community, were the first conservationists founded by the
###4651 Boone and Crocket back in 1887.  Uh, John, uh, we have, uh 50 groups now.
###4659 We uh, are are strong and well.  We work together, NRA, Boone and Crocket
###4665 uh, Russell Sportsman's Foundation, the Isaac Walton League, all
###4671 come together.  We have sign on letters that go uh to uh the
###4675 uh uh various uh uh members on the uh uh US Congress, the administration,
###4682 on issues that are important to us.  Uh we uh got the uh uh President
###4688 Bush uh to sign an executive order for a wildlife conference, uh in
###4693 2008, as you will remember.  And that was uh 100 years after Teddy
###4698 Roosevelt's first uh conservation uh summit on wildlife and natural
###4702 resources.  Uh.  We are now beginning to uh engage the environmental community,
###4708 and uh it it's kind of interesting, John, because uh the reason why
###4714 they are engaging with us is our science is better, we're getting
###4717 reception from uh uh not only our our legislators, uh but also uh
###4724 from the executive uh branch of government.  And uh the uh environmental community
###4729 is uh edging closer to us and uh we're making overtures, uh, that
###4734 uh one would not have thought possible, you know, 5 or 6 years ago.  So
###4739 I just wanted to uh to point out, because you and I have not had a
###4743 chance to talk about that recently, but to me this is one of the great
###4746 uh examples of collaboration uh working and it's working in a very quiet
###4752 way, very effective way, and we're pretty proud of it and as you
###4757 recall, we were there in smoky Missoula in 2000 and uh here we are some
###4764 12 years later and and uh it's been a very successful and gratifying,
###4768 uh, experience and just sort of an example of, to what the 3 of you
###4774 have been talking to uh uh the last hour and a half.  Thank you.
###4780 Mike Sullivan Thank you, Bob.
###4782 John Turner Bob, thanks for being here, and thanks
###4783 for the decades of you being in the trenches working for wildlife and
###4788 collaborative efforts.  And indeed the partnership, the coalition, the science
###4793 they're bringing just out of the Upper Green, on uh mule deer, and uh fisheries,
###4798 and pronghorn migration routes, and you're, as you continue to be, a
###4804 real leader in them and I salute you.  Uh indeed the sportsman in
###4808 this country has been at the forefront of conservation and putting their
###4812 money and their resources into protecting habitat and watersheds and I salute
###4816 you.  And Mike, I'd just like to say on coal I didn't say, I think
###4822 what we all need to do is work for a lot of the science that is going
###4825 on where uh on clean coal where we can strip carbon uh we ought to
###4831 continue it here in the United States and fortunately the new energy school
###4837 in down at the UW has got some will have some excellent research ongoing.
###4842 How do we use coal, to continue to use it for America's future,
###4846 for jobs, income and and in the coal better, we've stripped most of the
###4851 pollution out of coal in the last many  years.  Now the challenge is carbon.
###4857 Jack Durnell   I'm Jack Dernell from Meeteetee
###4858 Uh, trying to make it as short as I can.   I was enthused to be here today cause
###4865 I was with you when we, oh, Ted, and a few people, when we started this thing
###4870 at Laramie 18 years ago I guess.  Time flies, but what got me interested
###4876 in it was black footed ferret of course.  We formed an advisory group,
###4882 I said this is chaos, so we formed it, not knowing what we's doing,
###4886 but 14 years later I guess we saved them.  But during that time Governor
###4893 Sullivan uh started some, oh like with ranchers and management process
###4900 where we could bring in advisory people into the ranch which was not very
###4905 popular, and different ranchers could get all kinds of different groups
###4911 to come in and collaborate, on their ranch, and the wildlife, the rains,
###4917 the hydrology, anything that might pop to mind.  And we also had bureaucracies
###4925 that had advisory boards, which me and several others have served on.
###4931 So my question is all about collaboration.  I understand it, I've been in tons
###4937 of groups of collaboration, but every time, I'm not going just to pick
###4943 on the BLM, but they had rules, codes, regulations, that said we could
###4947 do this, this this, and this.  I said, yeah, but we worked for a
###4953 total year on the advisory group uh working out a plan for Wyoming
###4958 and Wyoming's BLM plans.  And it had environmentalists, it had hard
###4965 noses like me, ranchers, and we collaborated and at the end of the day
###4971 we had an agreement except for one thing, and it always came down to that
###4976 with the bureaucracy. I said, you cannot collaborate for Meeteetse
###4983 Wyoming, or Evanston or Gillette or coal or anything else unless
###4990 the local people, the social and the economic system comes down to
###4996 them and they have to play a part.  What they did is eliminate our
###5001 advisory board in Wyoming so we had no BLM advisory board.  They just
###5007 said, no, can't do that.   We can do the five that you agreed on the resources.
###5011 But social and economics has nothing to do with resource management.
###5017 And it happened time and time and time again.  And I've collaborated
###5023 with the Fish and Wildlife Services recently in the last 5 years in
###5028 DC.  I went there and they came to me and we did changed ideas and
###5034 things like that.  So I understood them better.  But it still bothers
###5038 me.  You gotta have the local people involved, social, economic has to
###5044 be involved, in resource management.  If you don't do it, you're going
###5048 to fail.  Do you agree or disagree?
###5051 Bill Ruckelshaus I mentioned earlier, you has to
###5054 see all the people as part of the ecosystem.  They have to
###5057 be allowed to prosper just like other things do.  And the leadership at
###5061 the national level has to understand that in order to make progress against
###5066 their own priorities.  And if they don't do that, it isn't effectively
###5071 done, and it is done, as a number, as Al said recently, it it's been done in a
###5076 number of areas and where it's not done it doesn't work. So that's
###5080 really what I mean by leadership in in those national agencies.
###5085 Mike Sullivan The black footed ferret wouldn't be
###5087 here  now except for the actions of Jack Turnell who was the one that
###5093 discovered it on his ranch and took the time. [Applause]
###5103 Okay.  Let's go here.  You notice
###5109 I'm favoring the right. Now figure that one out!
###5112 [Laughter]
###5116 David Dominc David Dominc, and uh from Cody.
###5119 I used to work under that Bill Ruckelshaus
###5123 guy.  Uh, it seems to me that uh we've heard about the bad guys,
###5129 we know who they are, the coal, the oil, the frackers, etc.  But, uh,
###5135 I was at the uh 45th anniversary of the Wyoming Outdoor Council the other
###5140 day  down in Lander, and it occurs to me that we have these environmental groups,
###5147 I think Bob O'Dell talked about the wildlife people, the hunters
###5151 and fishers, but we've got these wildlife groups in the is state,
###5154 Wyoming Outdoor Council, Sierra Club, Audubon society, of which I'm a
###5159 member, Potter Resource Group, Nature Conservancy, Greater Yellowstone
###5164 Coalition, uh and have they ever gotten together and asked and collaborated?
###5172 The word I got from one of the heads of that was, well we might
###5175 if we had something in common.  And I think that as an environmentalist,
###5180 uh that's something uh that our side out to begin to work on. Thank you.
###5185 Mike Sullivan Well let's leave that there.
###5187 [Laughter]
###5190 Bill Ruckelshaus He's right!  I mean, David, it's nice to
###5192 see you again.  He was in charge of the water program when he first
###5196 started to come over to the Interior Department.  And uh the truth is
###5201 that environmental groups aren't any more homogeneous than business
###5205 or anybody else.  Uh and uh they do cooperate often, not always,
###5212 and when you can't, when they're necessary for the decision to stick
###5216 and they're not willing to cooperate then you're better off not starting.
###5220 Uh when they are willing to compromise and work together, real progress can be had.
###5225 Male Speaker I haven't hear y'all mention the
###5232 National Environmental Policy Act and the cooperating part of it.  Especially
###5238 where we brought in the county commissioners and other conservation district
###5244 or facts were entered into these uh uh evaluation processes, NEPA,
###5254 to uh, get the facts.  And I think uh, I think the way you're using
###5263 Yellowstone, uh, a number of things I could go on.  But.  The facts
###5272 haven't been considered in a manner that they should.  That's why I
###5278 wanted your perspective on the National Environmental Policy Act.
###5283 John Turner I think uh the written in the 70s,
###5287 uh I think past the Nixon administration, was a very well intentioned that before we
###5292 embark on federal action that we really look at a comprehensive environment and
###5296 social impacts. Uh, I said well intended because my own personal opinion
###5304 is that NEPA's gotten so mired in processing bulk that it has become
###5311 less than user friendly.  Very uh attuned to activist groups, private sector,
###5318 non private, uh can stay involved in a very complex agency process,
###5324 but for average America to get  plugged into what becomes thousands
###5330 of pages and uh provide uh useful feedback to the federal
###5336 agency proposing action uh I'm not saying we throw it out, but I think
###5340 it's time we revisited NEPA.  And see how we can make it a process
###5346 that uh Americans across the board can find where they can plug into
###5352 it, uh learn something basic, and then provide feedback.  It just
###5357 seems like NEPA has has grown into a little a monster in process and bulk.
###5365 Bill Ruckelshaus I think the uh I would agree with
###5370 John that certainly that was not what was intended when NEPA was first passed.
###5374 Uh it was introduced by Senator Jackson, from the state of Washington, and it
###5379 was meant that when there was major federal projects it was restricted to federal
###5384 projects, there should be an understanding of the environmental impact of what
###5389 that project entailed.  It certainly didn't, it has evolved into a monster
###5395 maybe, I don't think too strong of a word, to describe it.  And it
###5400 may be that a collaborative process could be used to take a look at
###5403 NEPA and see if it can't improve it.  Not to abandon the idea of
###5409 taking into effect the environmental impact of what you're doing, but
###5413 doing it in a more rational fashion than exists under existing law.
###5417 It really is a a tremendous boon to consulting firms that do extremely
###5424 well by undertaking these 4000 page reports. To what extent it really
###5431 has an impact on development that has been official versus the cost of
###5437 it, is is kind of hard to justify today. I think I think therefore
###5442 I think we should take a look at how we can streamline; streamline
###5445 NEPA and make it work a lot better.  That may be possible if the Congress
###5449 were to were to in effect convene in a convener and convene a group
###5457 that could take an honest look at it and make recommendations for
###5459 improvement.  That would be the use of collaboration that I would think
###5463 would be very valuable.
###5465 Alan Simpson I think one of the things that
###5467 when I was there became, and uh still am a delightful friend of C Sanders,
###5473 who was the Democrat Secretary of Interior, earthy, wonderful guy,
###5478 and uh, when we went out he said, god, I came here with the thought
###5483 we could get something done.  And he said that all these groups that
###5488 fight everything are all connected.  Their their funding sources are
###5493 connected, their families are connected, it goes deep down into the system.
###5499 And I said, really?  He said, yeah.  He got out his little chart.  Then
###5505 there was a thing called the same facts were being generated, and
###5509 then a new name would pop up, uh, Save the Earth Quickly, or Save
###5514 the Earth in 10 Years, or Save the Earth Whatever, just all funded
###5519 by this amazing network of people who hire leagues of lawyers who
###5526 are good people.  All lawyers are good people.     [Laughter]
###5531 But it's almost like the old phrase, you unbuttoned your shirt and your
###5534 heart fell out.  Because they have lost sight of what really is going
###5539 on in the world.
###5541 
###5543 Male Speaker: First of all, I need to thank John
###5545 Turner for the fine uh commercial for the Wyoming Stock Growers' Land
###5548 Trust.  John, I hope that earns your forgiveness for the votes we probably
###5553 secured to defeat your conservation easement legislation 25 years ago.
###5558 But uh, one of the issues you have touched on a little bit here
###5562 in the last question.  It seems  that one the real distance
###5566 settings to collaboration today is uh the litigation process and
###5572 I don't mean litigation to solve substantive issues, which hopefully
###5576 sometimes the wisdom of our judges can do, but process litigation,
###5580 where it seems to be to some degree on all sides.  Uh, I might not get
###5587 what I want, but I can sure keep you from getting what you want.
###5590 Uh, all I have to do is file a lawsuit contending that some agency didn't
###5594 completely follow the process and I'll stymie the works for another
###5598 4 or 5 years and I'll have the satisfaction of knowing you didn't get what you
###5601 wanted.  How do we address that and remove that as a distance setting, so
###5606 unless there are series legal issues, we we as whatever side we represent,
###5612 can look at an issue and say, my best bet on getting this resolved or
###5618 at least come out to some degree with something I can live with is through the
###5621 collaborative process, not through uh hiring one of these wonderful
###5625 attorneys and showing up in the court room.
###5628 Bill Ruckelshaus One one of the reasons one of the ways
###5631 of doing that is an awareness of what you just said.  We had uh a statement
###5637 by Al earlier that rightness was a problem in trying to solve some
###5641 of these things.  Actually when people have been in court for 10 years
###5646 and spent 100s of thousands of dollars on legal fees, and maybe reach 10%
###5651 of the resolution of all of the problems that exists, that is ripe for collaboration.
###5655 People get discouraged after awhile when they're fighting each other
###5659 and not getting anywhere.  And they have this sense of we're winning
###5663 we're winning we're winning we lost, how did I get there?  And and even
###5667 though they have won in the lawsuit it's probably less than 10 or 15%
###5672 of what they need to to ultimately  achieve it.  And once people come to that
###5677 conclusion they often look for collaboration as a way of trying to
###5680 resolve their disputes and recognize that they have to harmonize their interests
###5683 with others. which makes it more likely they'll be successful in
###5688 a collaboration than before.  So issue can be over ripe, they get,
###5693 people get so mad at each other they can't talk to one another, but they
###5697 can also get exhausted by trying the other approaches to uh resolution
###5703 of our disputed and be ready for collaboration.
###5705 Mike Sullivan I think Jim's concern is he just
###5707 can't live that long! [Laughter]
###5709 Bill Ruckelshaus Me either, be we can at least start it.
###5712 Alan Simpson Jim Magagna, uh worked with his
###5716 industry in the wool growers, and it was a privilege to try to
###5720 help and launch occasions but this guy is so steady and he doesn't
###5724 get caught in, he's really trying, and and it is so true it's, I want
###5730 to deny you the pleasure of getting what you want and I know that I'll
###5734 probably lose but I know that I can screw you up for 2 or 3 or 4 years.
###5738 What a wonderful trait! [Laughter]
###5742 Boy, it's really out there and
###5744 it's so vivid and disgusting, and they pr- they they they preen about
###5749 it.  They're very proud of the fact that they stomped this by simply
###5753 filing the suit and then when they lose at every level they just keep
###5757 appealing and appealing, there's nothing appealing about them!
###5761 Male Speaker I think Dominic's comment made me
###5763 think for a moment that most most folks most citizens most voters know
###5770 what they know about complex issues from their interest groups that they're
###5774 part of, but yet most folks aren't part of those interest groups.  Most voters and
###5779 most citizens are highly confused.  The media is the only way they
###5783 learn what's going on and they don't learn much, because as Al
###5786 Simpson has pointed out nationally, uh uh the media thrives on polarization.
###5793 I had a news director tell me one time, nobody's interested in a message
###5797 from the muddled middle.  Well, the muddled middle is where everything
###5801 gets done!  And I wonder if, as collaboration moves forward, if it did,
###5808 if if those who are collaborating did a better job of reaching out to the
###5814 levers of medium.  And talking about what they're doing, what they're
###5817 actually getting accomplished.  If that might help quell some of the
###5821 noisy rabble on the right and on the left who are uh dragging the
###5825 dragging people's confidence in our political process right into the
###5829 mud.  What Al was able to do is Simpson bowls got the whole country talking
###5833 about the possibility, the possibility that we could deal with the defect.
###5837 And it was the first time anybody did.  You have a yahoo on the right
###5840 or the left showing up on the evening news, you had senator Simpson and
###5844 Erston Bowls talking about what was actually possible.
###5846 Mike Sullivan  That yahoo on the right [Laughter]
###5850 Panel Member Depending on which one you have!
###5851 Male Speaker  But anyway.  The point, has to do
###5853 with trying to the point has to do with recognizing through the course of
###5857 collaboration that outreach uh through  the media uh being aggressive about
###5861 it may yield tremendous benefits.
###5864 John Turner But it's really a a superb observation.
###5867 Uh the media has a real role to play.  And uh I've accused of often
###5873 being lazy.  And maybe it's just cause they're spread so thin, but
###5877 most of these, many of these resources issues, are difficult because they're
###5882 complex.  And and so to get the information out correctly, it's easy to do the
###5889 sexy thing, get a quote here, get a quote there.  The public still
###5892 doesn't know what in the hell's going on.  That's one of the things Bill
###5896 started out talking how a university then, can be a pretty good watering
###5902 hole just to provide basic information.  Uh on an issue uh the tools,
###5909 the issues, the science to date.  So a university can do that.  Plus
###5913 a group should try to see that, what are the facts that we agree on,
###5918 the challenges and the opportunities and then make an effort to get that
###5923 to the media, uh and have a spokesman trusted by all sides that can talk to
###5930 the media uh.  It was one of the most frustrating things I encountered
###5935 with the Northern Spotted Owl, which was very complex.  You turned on
###5940 the national news and you'd be interviewing somebody that was just a bird addict,
###5945 that worshiped spotted owls, then some poor guy afraid he was about
###5948 to have his mill shut down and lose his job.  That became the issue,
###5953 how you got all the critical aspects of uh the spotted owl issue out
###5961 to the press.  Getting them to take the time to look at those issues
###5964 it's a good point.
###5966 Bill Ruckelshaus Now I I think it's an excellent point.
###5969 And I think there ought to be built into one of these uh collaborative
###5972 process, uh a desire to assess how do we get this, let's assume we
###5977 come to some resolution of the issue.  How do we get that resolution to
###5981 and the approach that we took to get there out in front of the public
###5985 in such a way that they see these problems can be grappled with.
###5989 Maybe we don't understand every aspect of it, but look at these people
###5992 who've been fighting each other for years have sat-sat down and worked out
###5996 their differences and have now come forward.  I don't think that will
###6000 happen automatically I think we make a concerted effort then the process
###6003 itself to insure that the results are communicated we'll have a better
###6007 chance of of getting the right kind of result.
###6010 Mike Sillivan Al, you're an expert at the at the media.
###6013 What your response?    [Laughter]
###6018 Alan Simpson I've always had the very sick idea
###6020 that the First Amendment belonged to me too.  And when you knock on
###6024 them, then they shriek like gut shot panthers. It's wonderful to watch.
###6028 Because they'll say, it's just the public's right to know.  I say, yeah,
###6032 it's the public's right to know something that's real.  Uh not rumor and crap and just
###6037 garbage, that's the public's right to know and then, always, I love the phrase
###6043 "We stick by our story."  That just is a ritual, usually with violin
###6047 music in the background!  After they've hammered you flat, all erroneous,
###6051 and and fake, and they say, we stick to our story, our editorial board
###6056 has decided that Simpson is a kook and we've got to drive him out.
###6059 Lemme tell you.  An attack unanswered is an attack believed.  I've always
###6064 lived that way, I've always took them on.  But I tell you, they're
###6069 interested in confusion, controversy, and complexity, not clarity and
###6075 lemme tell you.  If you watch stuff, Charlie Rose and Jim Lair, you have
###6082 to bring your own brains to those sections.  There are staff members
###6087 who will not allow their senator or congressman to do those because
###6090 it's twenty minutes.  And their brain and their mouth is only done for
###6095 sound bites!  And they know just exactly what to use so they can
###6100 then go back and say he was on the news last night, usually babbling,
###6104 you know, 30 seconds worth, and you you couldn't get people to go on,
###6109 their staff wouldn't let them go on Jim Lair or Charlie Rose because
###6113 you had to sit there for 20 or 30 minutes and answer questions with
###6116 nobody around to shovel papers to you.  It's a vacuous group.  They're
###6122 there for re-election.  We're at a crossroads now in America between
###6127 cowardice and greed.  Cowardice of the legislators, and greed of those
###6132 people who don't want to do anything to that tax code, and it only helps
###6135 really 10% of the American people.  Look like I've never heard of that
###6139 stuff in there.  Abandon mine land reclamation.  Lord save you don't
###6143 want to oppose my own delegation, but when you use it to on the auditorium
###6148 at the University of Wyoming, that ain't exactly mine land reclamation.
###6152 So we have to dig into this stuff.  And when you do you get hammered
###6156 flat and then the media will always come up with some wrenching story,
###6163 some some probative thing I talked to a wonderful young gal in Cody
###6168 who just graduated from Columbia Journalism School, that's one of
###6172 the best. I said, what are you going to do now?  She said, I'm going
###6174 to be one of the hunters.  I said, what are you going to hunt?  She
###6177 said, people like you.  That's, that's her new you know she'll do a good
###6183 job.  She's bright and and but you know.  If every person in public
###6188 life is an adulterer, a rotten crook, corrupt, if every person in the
###6193 media is a drudge, this guy, that guy, then we all get tainted with
###6199 that.  I would think that unless the unless politicians and journalists
###6204 get together and decide that they are worthy parts of society, this
###6209 society can't exist.  As as long as people are disgusted with journalists
###6215 and disgusted with politicians, you can't hate politicians and love democracy,
###6220 and you can't hate journalists and love the Second Amendment, the First
###6224 Amendment, the whole thing.
###6226 Jessica Clout   Thank you very much.
###6230 Um I'm actually not really a member of the public.  I've apologized
###6233 to my colleagues, I'm very fortunate to just have joined the team at
###6237 the Ruckelshaus Institute and the School of Environment and Natural
###6240 Resources.  Um and I will be working on collaborative issues in Wyoming.
###6245 Um one thing I just wanted to bring to your attention and ask you if
###6249 you have any experience in this, and at this point I'm going to sit
###6252 down, um, I'm just, did I say my name?  Jessica Clout. Um, there's
###6258 also this idea of collaborative learning.  In natural resources we don't always
###6265 have to get to the table with the expectation that we come to a resolution.
###6270 That we, that we make a decision.  We could also just come to the
###6274 table to learn.  And I have a lot of experience in that.  And sometimes
###6281 it is precisely the issues, Bill, that you were mentioning, that might,
###6285 you felt were too hot, that actually might lend themselves to that kind
###6291 of approach, a collaborative learning approach.  Because it it takes the
###6296 it takes a little bit of the heat off.  And it might create an opportunity
###6300 for people to just come to the table, hear each other, learn from each
###6304 other, and if a decision can result from that they'll find out.  But
###6309 in the meantime, more is learned and it's not just the uh the speaking
###6314 people, it's it's some of a the people here we're referring to.  It's not
###6318 always the same voices.  And I was wondering  if you'd had any experience with that.
###6322 Bill Ruckelshaus Let me give you an example.  I I think
###6325 that's a very good point.  There is a, there're skeptics, about collaborative
###6329 processes who say they're endless and  they never come to a resolution and
###6333 they don't come to some final  conclusion, and that therefore I don't
###6337 want to participate in.  So you've got to be careful about that.  But we
###6341 had an experience at the beginning of the Institute, uh it it's been
###6345 almost 16 years ago now, but the Safe Drinking Water Act was coming
###6350 up for re-authorization by the congress, Senator Kempthorne from the neighboring
###6354 state of Idaho was the head of of the Subcommittee on the Environment
###6358 and Public Work Committee that was looking at it, in in order to educate
###6362 the board about the nature of collaborative processes, he took the Safe Drinking
###6367 Water Act and said, supposing this was something we needed to come
###6370 to a conclusion about, how would we do it?  And we spent two days,
###6374 I didn't think we'd come close to resolving the issues in there, and
###6378 we came to a conclusion.  There there were probably 25 people there about
###6382 what the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendment should say.  They were
###6386 causing tow towns like Torrington in a Wyoming to close down because
###6391 they couldn't afford the kind of filtration systems that were mandated
###6395 under the law.  We we reach an accommodation on this a lot of the disparate kind
###6400 of people represented on the board.  I took the results to Senator Kempthorne,
###6405 uh in the Senate a couple of weeks later, he said, how did you get
###6409 all these people to agree to this?  I said, well we just sat down and
###6412 discussed the issues and and everybody had their mind open, and listened
###6416 to one another and talked to one another, and we came to this conclusion.
###6419 He took our recommendations and put them in front of his committee
###6423 and they essentially became the law, essentially what the Safe Drinking
###6426 Water Act says now.  So it is possible to try something like this and just
###6432 for purposes of exchanging information find you can find common ground.
###6436 And then in this case just from kind of dumb luck, but we were here
###6442 and he was ready for something like this and we presented it to him
###6445 with a a a broad degree of a of  a representation and consensus.
###6452 He was not able to get on his committee he essentially used
###6457 that and it became the law.
###6459 John Turner I I think the observation on collaborative
###6463 learning is is a good one.  I think anybody we look at in the political
###6467 arena, or nonprofit, or industry, or whatever that's been affected,
###6472 maybe by experience they've learned to listen to other people and work
###6476 with them and accommodate them uh I can think of so many examples
###6480 in my life as a legislator where I had a great idea, and if people
###6484 would just do it the way I had figured it out we'd have it solved.
###6488 [Laughter] Simpson would screw around with it,
###6490 or Governor Sullivan, or the stock growers, or somebody would say, hell no, Turner,
###6495 but maybe if you we could accommodate this or that.  And again and again
###6500 I said, you know, if I hadn't listened and worked, there were things I
###6504 hadn't thought of, others' people's  concerns, and one of the good,
###6509 great things about the University Program that we've all been involved
###6512 in is collaborative learning in the University.  And it it really is
###6517 something to watch, where you take a students in diverse a disciplines,
###6523 a law student, a kid in energy, a kid business, uh a kid from wildlife,
###6528 uh and and put them together in a core group and they all have their
###6534 own slants.  Somebody's interested in business, somebody's interested
###6537 in engineering, and you and you bring these kids together, you provide
###6540 them a lot of information, and they've got to solve a real uh resource
###6545 issue.  Uh energy extraction in the Upper Green, or a major highway
###6550 or something, and they all gotta duke it out and learn from one another
###6553 and it's a whole semester.  Uh and Dr. Burke and others can provide more
###6558 information, but it's called uh Capstone, and I've had the opportunity to
###6564 just go down and speak to these kids, and boy they're thoughtful and innovative
###6568 and knocking heads and learning from one another and those are the life
###6571 skills that are going to make these, when they go into the private sector
###6576 or government or nonprofit or their own business, they're going to develop
###6580 some pretty neat skills in how to work with other people.  So collaborative
###6584 learning is such a a vital tool in helping anybody interested in these
###6589 processes.  How does that seem?
###6591 Alan Simpson I think the toughest problem
###6594 is the people that are there have seen so many of these things fail,
###6597 they in the elephant graveyard, they say, well, here's Turner, he
###6601 showed up, here's Ruckelshaus, Simpson, Sullivan, they tried that 10 years
###6605 ago, just give it up.  You never want to believe that.  You just
###6609 have to use continual perseverance, keep coming at them, they'll say,
###6613 don't appoint another commission, they've never done anything.  Well
###6616 let me tell you I've been on 3 that have done a lot.  I remember Immigration
###6619 and Refugee Policy with father Ted Hessler, Kennedy, bunch of us.
###6624 We did a legal immigration bill and an illegal immigration bill, didn't
###6629 work cause we couldn't get a more secure identifier, because the right
###6632 and the left said, that this is a national ID card.  That's how you
###6638 get things done.  Don't forget. The triggers, enrage, emotion, and
###6643 then you did the Iraq Study Group, we agreed with every word, 5 Dems,
###6648 5 Republicans, the last administration accepted about 5 of them, since
###6652 then 59 of them have been adopted as to what we suggested you do.
###6657 And now this hideous thing that Furston and I are involved in.
###6661 It doesn't matter what you call it, it ain't going away!  It's out there!
###6665 And this country is headed for some terribly tough time.  To think I
###6671 said to Anne, I've never been more energized, and she said, why is
###6676 that, I said, because at 81 now, I have achieved life's ultimate goal.
###6680 I have pissed off everyone in America! [Laughter/ Applause]
###6696 Mike Sullivan Do any of the panelists have any
###6697 that that you have left unsaid? [Laughter}
###6702 Bill Ruckelshaus I mean, I think Alan is
###6703 right though, I think he has pissed off everybody. [Laughter]
###6708 Mike Sullivan Well....
###6709 John Turner Thank you all!
###6711 Mike Sullivan Thank thanks to the audience. [Apause]
###6714 Music
###6773
