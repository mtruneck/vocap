1
0:0:19,22 --> 0:0:54,85
and


2
0:0:54,85 --> 0:1:18,1
and


3
0:1:18,1 --> 0:1:21,35
further never know what a wonderful
privilege of years to come into your


4
0:1:21,35 --> 0:1:23,54
presence


5
0:1:23,54 --> 0:1:26,94
we thank you for your holy word


6
0:1:26,94 --> 0:1:29,49
which is a shoe or compass


7
0:1:29,49 --> 0:1:33,25
in a world of confusion and rebuild


8
0:1:33,25 --> 0:1:35,97
and as we study today how about


9
0:1:35,97 --> 0:1:37,12
sulaiman


10
0:1:37,12 --> 0:1:40,3
a character in reaping a destiny


11
0:1:40,3 --> 0:1:44,63
we ask that your holy spirit will be
here to teach us


12
0:1:44,63 --> 0:1:47,15
we thank you for hearing our prayer


13
0:1:47,15 --> 0:1:52,96
for we ask it in jesus name, amen


14
0:1:52,96 --> 0:1:56,69
during the course of this seminar we
have been studying


15
0:1:56,69 --> 0:2:2,87
primarily the meaning obj and assist
chapter three and versus fifteen


16
0:2:2,87 --> 0:2:6,89
and i would like to refresh our memory
about that verse which is foundational


17
0:2:6,89 --> 0:2:9,879
to all of scripture


18
0:2:9,879 --> 0:2:14,169
any adverse god is speaking to the
serpent


19
0:2:14,169 --> 0:2:18,219
and adam and eve are spending their
endlessly


20
0:2:18,219 --> 0:2:20,719
and dot says to the serpent


21
0:2:20,719 --> 0:2:23,59
i won't put admit the


22
0:2:23,59 --> 0:2:26,79
between you know and the woman


23
0:2:26,79 --> 0:2:30,139
and between your steven and her seat


24
0:2:30,139 --> 0:2:32,969
he shelled bruise your head


25
0:2:32,969 --> 0:2:35,28
and you shell bruise


26
0:2:35,28 --> 0:2:37,199
his feet


27
0:2:37,199 --> 0:2:41,289
one thing is very very clear investors


28
0:2:41,289 --> 0:2:45,29
and that is that there were only tour
groups


29
0:2:45,29 --> 0:2:47,23
that exists in this world


30
0:2:47,23 --> 0:2:48,929
from the beginning


31
0:2:48,929 --> 0:2:50,76
till the end of time


32
0:2:50,76 --> 0:2:52,839
although it does scenes


33
0:2:52,839 --> 0:2:57,19
the scene of the righteous embassy of
the week


34
0:2:57,19 --> 0:3:0,999
now in our study today we're going to
notice


35
0:3:0,999 --> 0:3:4,749
itgroup which is classified as the
wicked


36
0:3:4,749 --> 0:3:8,11
there are three different kinds


37
0:3:8,11 --> 0:3:9,629
of people


38
0:3:9,629 --> 0:3:11,899
or ask unblocked side


39
0:3:11,899 --> 0:3:13,91
there is only one


40
0:3:13,91 --> 0:3:16,39
tight of person


41
0:3:16,39 --> 0:3:20,209
so in the category outs safe and see


42
0:3:20,209 --> 0:3:22,29
are free types of people


43
0:3:22,29 --> 0:3:25,439
whereas on the side of goradze


44
0:3:25,439 --> 0:3:26,799
there is only


45
0:3:26,799 --> 0:3:28,609
one time


46
0:3:28,609 --> 0:3:32,869
number of other study today the famous
parable of jesus


47
0:3:32,869 --> 0:3:34,249
of the seller


48
0:3:34,249 --> 0:3:36,469
who sold the sea


49
0:3:36,469 --> 0:3:42,139
and as we began i would like to say that
this parable is found in all three


50
0:3:42,139 --> 0:3:47,23
of the synoptic gospels when i mean by
the synoptic gospels is matthew


51
0:3:47,23 --> 0:3:48,339
mark


52
0:3:48,339 --> 0:3:50,49
and lou


53
0:3:50,49 --> 0:3:53,539
this terrible has filed an all three of
these gospels


54
0:3:53,539 --> 0:3:58,629
which means that we're not going to
remain only in one gospel as we study


55
0:3:58,629 --> 0:3:59,859
this parable


56
0:3:59,859 --> 0:4:4,31
were going to go out to matthew mark and
luke


57
0:4:4,31 --> 0:4:6,949
in order to do we need details


58
0:4:6,949 --> 0:4:12,9
from every single one arby's


59
0:4:12,9 --> 0:4:13,419
gospels


60
0:4:13,419 --> 0:4:17,19
and as i am speaking now i would like to
ask


61
0:4:17,19 --> 0:4:22,159
the deacons to please distribute the
list of cuts and almost hit my mind


62
0:4:22,159 --> 0:4:26,69
we have less attacks and we would like
the deacons at this point to please


63
0:4:26,69 --> 0:4:27,5
quickly


64
0:4:27,5 --> 0:4:28,209
distribute


65
0:4:28,209 --> 0:4:30,139
these lists of tents


66
0:4:30,139 --> 0:4:32,81
we want them again


67
0:4:32,81 --> 0:4:35,919
look at matthew chapter thirteen


68
0:4:35,919 --> 0:4:38,5
adverse thirty-seven


69
0:4:38,5 --> 0:4:40,289
matthew chapter thirteen


70
0:4:40,289 --> 0:4:41,41
adverse


71
0:4:41,41 --> 0:4:43,169
thirty-seven


72
0:4:43,169 --> 0:4:45,449
we want to determine first of all


73
0:4:45,449 --> 0:4:49,389
who sa lawyer of the cv is


74
0:4:49,389 --> 0:4:53,71
it says they're and matthew thirteen and
burst thirty-seven


75
0:4:53,71 --> 0:4:56,419
the following


76
0:4:56,419 --> 0:4:59,539
he answered and said to them


77
0:4:59,539 --> 0:5:1,16
whose sole role is


78
0:5:1,16 --> 0:5:3,29
dot blot cd


79
0:5:3,29 --> 0:5:5,15
is the psalm


80
0:5:5,15 --> 0:5:6,649

0:5:6,649 --> 0:5:9,5
son the parable of the solar


82
0:5:9,5 --> 0:5:11,22
the person whose sole was


83
0:5:11,22 --> 0:5:12,8
but let's see


84
0:5:12,8 --> 0:5:14,56
is not less


85
0:5:14,56 --> 0:5:16,499
vinci's was


86
0:5:16,499 --> 0:5:21,3
now we also want to determine what the
seeded represents


87
0:5:21,3 --> 0:5:24,2
going to make to the gospel of luke


88
0:5:24,2 --> 0:5:25,789

108
0:6:9,86 --> 0:6:11,889

here we find the profits speaking the
following wertz


110
0:6:16,669 --> 0:6:18,869
isaiah chapter fifty five


111
0:6:18,869 --> 0:6:20,83
and vs


112
0:6:20,83 --> 0:6:22,209
and eleven


113
0:6:22,209 --> 0:6:24,849

114
0:6:24,849 --> 0:6:27,469
and this al from heaven


115
0:6:27,469 --> 0:6:29,8
and do not return there


116
0:6:29,8 --> 0:6:31,71
but a lot of the earth


117
0:6:31,71 --> 0:6:35,39
and make it bring forth embarked


118
0:6:35,39 --> 0:6:37,83
that it may give seat to this solar


119
0:6:37,83 --> 0:6:40,8
and director of the heater


120
0:6:40,8 --> 0:6:42,409
saw show mind worded


121
0:6:42,409 --> 0:6:45,63
being that goes forth from my mouth


122
0:6:45,63 --> 0:6:48,849
it shall not to return it to me about it


123
0:6:48,849 --> 0:6:50,819
but inshallah com police


124
0:6:50,819 --> 0:6:52,579
what high please


125
0:6:52,579 --> 0:6:57,78
and it shall prosper engulfing for which
i sent it


126
0:6:57,78 --> 0:7:1,559
here god promises that what he saw
secede


127
0:7:1,559 --> 0:7:4,87
his cv well bear fruit


128
0:7:4,87 --> 0:7:10,8
his seat is powerful his word is
powerful


129
0:7:10,8 --> 0:7:12,299
so what do we have so far


130
0:7:12,299 --> 0:7:13,639
we have a sartre


131
0:7:13,639 --> 0:7:15,289
who is jesus


132
0:7:15,289 --> 0:7:18,729
we have a seed which is the word of god


133
0:7:18,729 --> 0:7:25,819
and that seed is powerful to produce the
results for which got sent it


134
0:7:25,819 --> 0:7:29,15
but had this terrible we also have for


135
0:7:29,15 --> 0:7:31,5
the effort saw deals


136
0:7:31,5 --> 0:7:34,889
for different grounds so-to-speak


137
0:7:34,889 --> 0:7:37,879
now the question is what do these four
soils


138
0:7:37,879 --> 0:7:39,439
represent


139
0:7:39,439 --> 0:7:41,94
daughter making the gospel of mark


140
0:7:41,94 --> 0:7:43,289
chapter four


141
0:7:43,289 --> 0:7:45,18
and verse fifteen


142
0:7:45,18 --> 0:7:47,139
marked chapter four


143
0:7:47,139 --> 0:7:48,7
and verse


144
0:7:48,7 --> 0:7:49,289
fifteen


145
0:7:49,289 --> 0:7:51,9
here we have an explanation of what is
meant to be


146
0:7:51,9 --> 0:7:54,229
by the soils


147
0:7:54,229 --> 0:7:55,53
it says here


148
0:7:55,53 --> 0:7:57,159
the following


149
0:7:57,159 --> 0:7:59,57
and this is speaking about the seed


150
0:7:59,57 --> 0:8:2,179
that fail by the wayside


151
0:8:2,179 --> 0:8:7,449
but it'll give us the principal for all
alba solos excessive risk fifteen


152
0:8:7,449 --> 0:8:10,739
and these are the ones by the wayside


153
0:8:10,739 --> 0:8:13,539
where the word is sold


154
0:8:13,539 --> 0:8:14,889
i hear


155
0:8:14,889 --> 0:8:17,729
saic outcomes immediately


156
0:8:17,729 --> 0:8:19,729
and takes on going


157
0:8:19,729 --> 0:8:23,89
but what are the that was solloway


158
0:8:23,89 --> 0:8:26,199
there was solid in their hearts


159
0:8:26,199 --> 0:8:26,969
so that's it


160
0:8:26,969 --> 0:8:30,169
in his sock in the ground or at the soil


161
0:8:30,169 --> 0:8:32,94
but that's all i a lot represents what


162
0:8:32,94 --> 0:8:35,19
the seidel represents


163
0:8:35,19 --> 0:8:36,71
the heart


164
0:8:36,71 --> 0:8:40,45
and so this parable of the sort you out
for it


165
0:8:40,45 --> 0:8:43,9
different kinds of hearts


166
0:8:43,9 --> 0:8:46,72
reactance hearts an undesirable


167
0:8:46,72 --> 0:8:49,87
all only one of them is desirable


168
0:8:49,87 --> 0:8:50,77
in fact three


169
0:8:50,77 --> 0:8:54,57
have these hearts etc dot being in the
camp of satan


170
0:8:54,57 --> 0:8:59,3
and only one of these aesop being on the
side


171
0:8:59,3 --> 0:9:0,71
of god


172
0:9:0,71 --> 0:9:6,4
edsall summarizing what we've studied we
have this parable what's sort who is


173
0:9:6,4 --> 0:9:6,93
jesus


174
0:9:6,93 --> 0:9:10,22
we have watched seed which is the word
of god


175
0:9:10,22 --> 0:9:15,52
the work of god is powerful to account
police dot dot progress for which it is


176
0:9:15,52 --> 0:9:16,36
sent


177
0:9:16,36 --> 0:9:17,91
and finally


178
0:9:17,91 --> 0:9:19,38
this sidles


179
0:9:19,38 --> 0:9:20,44
represent


180
0:9:20,44 --> 0:9:25,85
for different kinds of of hearts upon
which the seed of the truth of god's


181
0:9:25,85 --> 0:9:26,43
word


182
0:9:26,43 --> 0:9:27,94
falls


183
0:9:27,94 --> 0:9:31,18
now let's examine all four of these
sorts


184
0:9:31,18 --> 0:9:34,9
and see what they have to teach us today


185
0:9:34,9 --> 0:9:36,87
let school first of all up to that


186
0:9:36,87 --> 0:9:40,92
seemed that failed by the wayside or on
the path


187
0:9:40,92 --> 0:9:43,4
dark made on both chapter eight


188
0:9:43,4 --> 0:9:47,61
and we'll read verse twelve look chapter
eight


189
0:9:47,61 --> 0:9:49,899
adverse twelve the scene


190
0:9:49,899 --> 0:9:51,85
by the wayside


191
0:9:51,85 --> 0:9:53,27
it says here


192
0:9:53,27 --> 0:9:55,59
bolstered by the wayside


193
0:9:55,59 --> 0:9:58,63
i don't want to hear


194
0:9:58,63 --> 0:10:3,75
by the way everyone in this parable
here's


195
0:10:3,75 --> 0:10:7,87
blowouts who cesar planted by the
wayside


196
0:10:7,87 --> 0:10:9,7
the hearts


197
0:10:9,7 --> 0:10:10,41
here


198
0:10:10,41 --> 0:10:12,28
though i wasn't starting classes


199
0:10:12,28 --> 0:10:14,9
the people here


200
0:10:14,9 --> 0:10:15,87
but some on flyers


201
0:10:15,87 --> 0:10:17,67
the people here


202
0:10:17,67 --> 0:10:21,7
bars on the ground the people in it


203
0:10:21,7 --> 0:10:25,29
in other words there's no way of saying
i didn't know all this


204
0:10:25,29 --> 0:10:30,25
in other words everyone is responsible
because every one of these soils


205
0:10:30,25 --> 0:10:31,17
here's


206
0:10:31,17 --> 0:10:32,74
the word of god


207
0:10:32,74 --> 0:10:37,28
now knock us once again it says in verse
twelve lost by the wayside


208
0:10:37,28 --> 0:10:39,67
are the ones who here


209
0:10:39,67 --> 0:10:41,82
vet devil comes


210
0:10:41,82 --> 0:10:45,32
and tanks are weighing dole word


211
0:10:45,32 --> 0:10:46,889
out of their hearts


212
0:10:46,889 --> 0:10:48,899
lest they should be leaving


213
0:10:48,899 --> 0:10:50,39
and do you want


214
0:10:50,39 --> 0:10:52,39

0:10:52,39 --> 0:10:55,189
falls on the wayside are on the path


216
0:10:55,189 --> 0:10:58,26
does not even begin to germany


217
0:10:58,26 --> 0:11:0,879
democracy vase of the heart


218
0:11:0,879 --> 0:11:4,5
the devil comes and takes away to see


219
0:11:4,5 --> 0:11:7,639

of god


220
0:11:7,639 --> 0:11:13,429

word or they postpone they refuse to

what god


223
0:11:15,26 --> 0:11:17,9

persuasive and powerful you almost

0:13:46,82 --> 0:13:49,33
deceived fail underpaid


284
0:13:49,33 --> 0:13:51,96
the seed failed by the wayside


285
0:13:51,96 --> 0:13:54,49
it did not given begin to germinate


286
0:13:54,49 --> 0:13:56,22
in the heart


287
0:13:56,22 --> 0:14:0,209
these types of here is our also
illustrated bites


288
0:14:0,209 --> 0:14:1,7
those


289
0:14:1,7 --> 0:14:5,49
who stalled steven the first christian
barter


290
0:14:5,49 --> 0:14:8,81
but what made to the book up acts
chapter seven


291
0:14:8,81 --> 0:14:11,4
acts separate seven


292
0:14:11,4 --> 0:14:16,76
but either way this whole chapter almost
yes a sermon presented


293
0:14:16,76 --> 0:14:18,54
by steven


294
0:14:18,54 --> 0:14:20,329
to the jury said he'd read


295
0:14:20,329 --> 0:14:22,15
to the jewish council


296
0:14:22,15 --> 0:14:25,4
now watch notice what happens after


297
0:14:25,4 --> 0:14:27,71
the sermon is preached


298
0:14:27,71 --> 0:14:32,0
chapter seven and starting with versus
fifty four


299
0:14:32,0 --> 0:14:34,52
it says well they heard these things


300
0:14:34,52 --> 0:14:37,12
they were cut to the heart


301
0:14:37,12 --> 0:14:38,209
and a net


302
0:14:38,209 --> 0:14:41,87
stab him with their he


303
0:14:41,87 --> 0:14:44,7
they were really angry weren't there


304
0:14:44,7 --> 0:14:48,61
but heat being fought the holy spirit
day is going to happen


305
0:14:48,61 --> 0:14:53,48
and saw the glory of god and jesus
standing at the right hand of god


306
0:14:53,48 --> 0:14:54,8
and said look


307
0:14:54,8 --> 0:14:59,49
i seem to have a solvent and the set-up
man standing of the right hand of god


308
0:14:59,49 --> 0:15:3,65
vandyck krakow without loud voice


309
0:15:3,65 --> 0:15:4,23
bear


310
0:15:4,23 --> 0:15:5,7
errors


311
0:15:5,7 --> 0:15:7,64
and ran at him with a card


312
0:15:7,64 --> 0:15:11,68
and a cat scan out of the city and
stoned him


313
0:15:11,68 --> 0:15:17,77
and the witnesses lay down their clothes
at the feet of a young man named song


314
0:15:17,77 --> 0:15:19,62
gnashing their teeth


315
0:15:19,62 --> 0:15:21,82
their hearts a raging within them


316
0:15:21,82 --> 0:15:26,17
rejecting this wonderful simon that
stephen had preached


317
0:15:26,17 --> 0:15:30,74
beginning way back in the old testament
and showing how prophecy was fulfilled


318
0:15:30,74 --> 0:15:33,59
and eventually the messiah came


319
0:15:33,59 --> 0:15:35,47
the openly rejected


320
0:15:35,47 --> 0:15:37,319
the message that god presented


321
0:15:37,319 --> 0:15:38,71
through stephen


322
0:15:38,71 --> 0:15:43,61
by the way in the end time there are
going to be people like this also


323
0:15:43,61 --> 0:15:48,1
in fact all of those who received the
message of the anti christ will be


324
0:15:48,1 --> 0:15:51,1
eventually be people of this time


325
0:15:51,1 --> 0:15:53,98
not a second thessalonians chapter two


326
0:15:53,98 --> 0:15:59,69
second fazal audience chapter two and i
would like to read afew verses that we


327
0:15:59,69 --> 0:16:3,26
find they're beginning with burst eight


328
0:16:3,26 --> 0:16:7,34
it says they're embattled lol this one
will be revealed


329
0:16:7,34 --> 0:16:9,56
that's the anti christ by the way


330
0:16:9,56 --> 0:16:13,199
hold a lark will consume with the breath
of his mouth


331
0:16:13,199 --> 0:16:16,93
and destroyed with the brightness for
this coming


332
0:16:16,93 --> 0:16:20,49
the coming up a lot less one is
according to the working of satan


333
0:16:20,49 --> 0:16:24,38
without power assigns and line wonders


334
0:16:24,38 --> 0:16:28,11
and that's all i might just be section
among those who perished


335
0:16:28,11 --> 0:16:30,4
and now morris why they perish


336
0:16:30,4 --> 0:16:31,49
because


337
0:16:31,49 --> 0:16:34,3
they did not greasy what


338
0:16:34,3 --> 0:16:36,48
the laugh public truth


339
0:16:36,48 --> 0:16:40,27
that they might be saved by the way what
is truth


340
0:16:40,27 --> 0:16:43,5
jesus said in john seventeen percent
gain


341
0:16:43,5 --> 0:16:49,7
sanctified and through your truth yaar
wondered is truth


342
0:16:49,7 --> 0:16:52,589
so what has rejected if they did not
receive the love of the truth


343
0:16:52,589 --> 0:16:55,67
they rejected truth which is found where


344
0:16:55,67 --> 0:16:58,3
in the holy bible


345
0:16:58,3 --> 0:17:1,6
norris what we find enforced eleven


346
0:17:1,6 --> 0:17:4,23
and for this reason dot will send them
elsewhere


347
0:17:4,23 --> 0:17:5,39
notion


348
0:17:5,39 --> 0:17:7,24
that they should be in the black


349
0:17:7,24 --> 0:17:8,94
the line


350
0:17:8,94 --> 0:17:9,799
that they are


351
0:17:9,799 --> 0:17:11,77
they condemned who did not


352
0:17:11,77 --> 0:17:12,839
relieve what


353
0:17:12,839 --> 0:17:13,919
the truth


354
0:17:13,919 --> 0:17:15,31
but had pleasure


355
0:17:15,31 --> 0:17:17,199
in on righteousness


356
0:17:17,199 --> 0:17:20,189
and as a serious rang


357
0:17:20,189 --> 0:17:21,97
to have the word of god preached


358
0:17:21,97 --> 0:17:24,89
and presented to you


359
0:17:24,89 --> 0:17:27,12
and the first type of soil represents
those


360
0:17:27,12 --> 0:17:28,94
who hear our caller


361
0:17:28,94 --> 0:17:29,65
but email


362
0:17:29,65 --> 0:17:32,739
hardly wear cubs they shot out the word


363
0:17:32,739 --> 0:17:35,77
the work does not even began germinate


364
0:17:35,77 --> 0:17:40,2
and as a result take sacred takes the
troops from the heart


365
0:17:40,2 --> 0:17:43,9
and those who have this kind of soil


366
0:17:43,9 --> 0:17:44,87
i lost


367
0:17:44,87 --> 0:17:47,32
but we have a second kind of song


368
0:17:47,32 --> 0:17:48,61
it's the soil


369
0:17:48,61 --> 0:17:51,25
unse stoney


370
0:17:51,25 --> 0:17:53,47
go with me to the gospel of luke


371
0:17:53,47 --> 0:17:56,9
chapter eight adversities


372
0:17:56,9 --> 0:17:58,79
the gospel of luke chapter eight


373
0:17:58,79 --> 0:18:1,9
and versus six


374
0:18:1,9 --> 0:18:5,72
the description obvious conduct so
little


375
0:18:5,72 --> 0:18:6,92
it says there


376
0:18:6,92 --> 0:18:10,13
the following


377
0:18:10,13 --> 0:18:13,36
fail under a rock


378
0:18:13,36 --> 0:18:16,99
anis has its frank


379
0:18:16,99 --> 0:18:21,86
it with their outweighing because it
lacked what


380
0:18:21,86 --> 0:18:23,23
meister


381
0:18:23,23 --> 0:18:26,36
now i watch visualize that what's
happening here


382
0:18:26,36 --> 0:18:30,5
there is a rock but there's also some
good site


383
0:18:30,5 --> 0:18:34,909
because the scene germinate skynet
begins to grow isn't that right


384
0:18:34,909 --> 0:18:39,169
you know is that this cd this saw is
different than the first so because the


385
0:18:39,169 --> 0:18:42,9
first solo even before the siege
emanates


386
0:18:42,9 --> 0:18:44,26
the devil concentrated from the heart


387
0:18:44,26 --> 0:18:45,72
but here at least


388
0:18:45,72 --> 0:18:48,63
the cd cancer its process of growth
there


389
0:18:48,63 --> 0:18:51,1
yes some subtle there


390
0:18:51,1 --> 0:18:56,1
but we noticed then looked after eight
that that's on a lot lack slot


391
0:18:56,1 --> 0:18:57,26
it lacks


392
0:18:57,26 --> 0:18:59,14
mores jer


393
0:18:59,14 --> 0:19:3,72
and by the way it's stony it's rocky
this not year or so little


394
0:19:3,72 --> 0:19:7,2
there's also stalled with the soil


395
0:19:7,2 --> 0:19:11,18
by the way as we witness in matthew
thirteen it gives us an additional


396
0:19:11,18 --> 0:19:12,18
detail


397
0:19:12,18 --> 0:19:15,37
noise matthew thirteen vs five and six


398
0:19:15,37 --> 0:19:17,2
matthew chapter thirteen


399
0:19:17,2 --> 0:19:18,86
and vs five


400
0:19:18,86 --> 0:19:20,43
and six


401
0:19:20,43 --> 0:19:21,95
it says here


402
0:19:21,95 --> 0:19:25,169
south fail un stony places


403
0:19:25,169 --> 0:19:28,88
werent they did not have much whacked


404
0:19:28,88 --> 0:19:30,679
much are


405
0:19:30,679 --> 0:19:31,7
and the email


406
0:19:31,7 --> 0:19:33,179
italy sprang up


407
0:19:33,179 --> 0:19:36,66
because they have no depth of cars


408
0:19:36,66 --> 0:19:40,34
but notice but when the sun was opt


409
0:19:40,34 --> 0:19:42,34
they were sparked ste


410
0:19:42,34 --> 0:19:45,529
an because they have no route


411
0:19:45,529 --> 0:19:46,4
they work


412
0:19:46,4 --> 0:19:50,23
they withered away nonetheless the
combination that we have here


413
0:19:50,23 --> 0:19:51,599
we have saw al


414
0:19:51,599 --> 0:19:55,39
which is not always so little but you
have rocked


415
0:19:55,39 --> 0:19:56,73
in the song


416
0:19:56,73 --> 0:19:58,35
you outside a little


417
0:19:58,35 --> 0:20:1,46
that does not have moisture


418
0:20:1,46 --> 0:20:3,299
and you have the same dead


419
0:20:3,299 --> 0:20:5,72
it's down upon the soil


420
0:20:5,72 --> 0:20:7,46
and scratches


421
0:20:7,46 --> 0:20:8,82
the sea


422
0:20:8,82 --> 0:20:11,25
starches the newborn client


423
0:20:11,25 --> 0:20:14,73
now you imagine some of you living here
in the valley i may i imagine have


424
0:20:14,73 --> 0:20:15,8
gardens


425
0:20:15,8 --> 0:20:18,27
what would happen if you plant a seed


426
0:20:18,27 --> 0:20:24,22
and it adds just a little bit soil
enhancements stall owner underneath that


427
0:20:24,22 --> 0:20:27,7
and so you plant the seed superficially


428
0:20:27,7 --> 0:20:30,61
there's no forrester hardly in the earth


429
0:20:30,61 --> 0:20:35,74
and the sound of that fresno side are
intending residual i you know about that


430
0:20:35,74 --> 0:20:36,43
is big


431
0:20:36,43 --> 0:20:38,15
came out of time to see


432
0:20:38,15 --> 0:20:42,54
how much of an opportunity does that
seem to have to germinate and grow and


433
0:20:42,54 --> 0:20:45,24
eventually produce fruit


434
0:20:45,24 --> 0:20:47,9
very


435
0:20:47,9 --> 0:20:50,46
now what does the seed planted


436
0:20:50,46 --> 0:20:52,16
i'm stony ground


437
0:20:52,16 --> 0:20:53,94
represent


438
0:20:53,94 --> 0:20:56,97
well it represents those individuals


439
0:20:56,97 --> 0:21:0,35
who when the dust bowl it's preach to
them


440
0:21:0,35 --> 0:21:4,16
thrilled with excitement and with the
motion


441
0:21:4,16 --> 0:21:5,9
has planted in the heart


442
0:21:5,9 --> 0:21:11,2
and a they say this is wonderful i've
never heard anything like it in my light


443
0:21:11,2 --> 0:21:13,38
and they got all of those


444
0:21:13,38 --> 0:21:16,56
but then trials and tribulations come


445
0:21:16,56 --> 0:21:19,95
you see one of the problems that people
have is that they think that when they


446
0:21:19,95 --> 0:21:24,18
accept the gospel it's been a key or all
of their problems they're not going to


447
0:21:24,18 --> 0:21:29,17
have temptations are difficulties are
tribulations anymore the fact is false


448
0:21:29,17 --> 0:21:32,89
their greatest tribulations com after
baptism


449
0:21:32,89 --> 0:21:37,42
the greatest tests of the devil come
after we've decided to get our hearts to


450
0:21:37,42 --> 0:21:40,659
jesus christ i see many of you nodding
you say yes


451
0:21:40,659 --> 0:21:42,4
that's absolutely true


452
0:21:42,4 --> 0:21:44,77
because the devil has lost a child


453
0:21:44,77 --> 0:21:50,159
and he's got to make it as difficult as
possible to try and gain that child back


454
0:21:50,159 --> 0:21:53,11
but there are people that when the dust
was preached when we have a series of


455
0:21:53,11 --> 0:21:54,259
meetings like this


456
0:21:54,259 --> 0:21:55,89
their all pumped up


457
0:21:55,89 --> 0:21:57,309
and they're really excited


458
0:21:57,309 --> 0:22:1,7
and then they have problems with their
families that have problems with their


459
0:22:1,7 --> 0:22:3,63
relatives they have problems at work


460
0:22:3,63 --> 0:22:5,57
they have all sorts of difficulties


461
0:22:5,57 --> 0:22:9,58
perhaps i can tell you having problems
with some of the habits that they had


462
0:22:9,58 --> 0:22:11,71
and they get discouraged


463
0:22:11,71 --> 0:22:13,809
and as a result the fall


464
0:22:13,809 --> 0:22:15,64
by the wayside


465
0:22:15,64 --> 0:22:18,83
by the way this c this so little


466
0:22:18,83 --> 0:22:20,36
represents those


467
0:22:20,36 --> 0:22:23,98
who want disarmed jesus and themselves


468
0:22:23,98 --> 0:22:26,58
you see the stone represents a stoner


469
0:22:26,58 --> 0:22:30,0
that some other kind of good song which
means that they want to serve the lord


470
0:22:30,0 --> 0:22:32,83
but they also want to keep some of self


471
0:22:32,83 --> 0:22:35,429
these are the ones that jesus spoke
about what he said


472
0:22:35,429 --> 0:22:36,62
noel man


473
0:22:36,62 --> 0:22:38,93
ken starr effort to masters


474
0:22:38,93 --> 0:22:42,21
you cannot serve the lord with a divided
heart in other words


475
0:22:42,21 --> 0:22:45,71
it easy there everything are nothing


476
0:22:45,71 --> 0:22:49,79
now i want you to notice acouple of
passages in scripture


477
0:22:49,79 --> 0:22:51,36
did speak about


478
0:22:51,36 --> 0:22:55,62
what happens when we receive the gospel
of jesus but what made a mark chapter


479
0:22:55,62 --> 0:22:58,74
ten and versus twenty eight to thirty
one


480
0:22:58,74 --> 0:23:0,22
mark chapter ten


481
0:23:0,22 --> 0:23:2,22
and versus twenty eight


482
0:23:2,22 --> 0:23:4,9
two thirty one


483
0:23:4,9 --> 0:23:7,76
jesus has just talked about how
difficult it is far rich man to enter


484
0:23:7,76 --> 0:23:9,48
the kingdom of heaven


485
0:23:9,48 --> 0:23:11,0
and i want you to notice


486
0:23:11,0 --> 0:23:15,25
what jesus continues saint of the
disciples because they say we've left it


487
0:23:15,25 --> 0:23:19,16
all what's in it for us see they were
kind of mercenaries


488
0:23:19,16 --> 0:23:22,779
and so jesus says unmarked and beginning
adverse


489
0:23:22,779 --> 0:23:23,98
twenty-eight


490
0:23:23,98 --> 0:23:25,82
the following


491
0:23:25,82 --> 0:23:27,67
mark ten twenty eight


492
0:23:27,67 --> 0:23:32,27
that appear began to say to him


493
0:23:32,27 --> 0:23:34,63
we have left all and followed you


494
0:23:34,63 --> 0:23:36,929
sought jesus answered and said


495
0:23:36,929 --> 0:23:38,669
assuredly i say to you


496
0:23:38,669 --> 0:23:40,6
there is no one who was left house


497
0:23:40,6 --> 0:23:43,7
or brothers or sisters or father


498
0:23:43,7 --> 0:23:46,19
or mother or wife


499
0:23:46,19 --> 0:23:47,39
or children


500
0:23:47,39 --> 0:23:48,69
all our lands


501
0:23:48,69 --> 0:23:51,679
for might say abduct schools


502
0:23:51,679 --> 0:23:56,94
who shall not receive haha dreadful now
and this time houses and brothers and


503
0:23:56,94 --> 0:24:1,129
sisters and mothers and children and
lands


504
0:24:1,129 --> 0:24:1,87
now most


505
0:24:1,87 --> 0:24:3,88
the next expression


506
0:24:3,88 --> 0:24:5,79
slot


507
0:24:5,79 --> 0:24:7,84
persecutions


508
0:24:7,84 --> 0:24:9,94
enemy you stuck come


509
0:24:9,94 --> 0:24:11,71
eternal life


510
0:24:11,71 --> 0:24:15,7
did you know is that you receive many
blessings because you have a new family


511
0:24:15,7 --> 0:24:16,52
into a church family


512
0:24:16,52 --> 0:24:19,92
and so you have everything you need
within the church family


513
0:24:19,92 --> 0:24:25,23
but the etc but we find jesus saying
that this will be with what


514
0:24:25,23 --> 0:24:27,22
persecution


515
0:24:27,22 --> 0:24:29,389
norris matthew chapter ten


516
0:24:29,389 --> 0:24:33,76
and beginning with versus thirty-four
the same idea coming through


517
0:24:33,76 --> 0:24:37,769
matthew chapter denver study for by the
way it's become very popular today


518
0:24:37,769 --> 0:24:40,849
to see on television television
preachers


519
0:24:40,849 --> 0:24:42,94
would tell you that when you receive
jesus


520
0:24:42,94 --> 0:24:46,12
you're going to prosper you're going to
get directs


521
0:24:46,12 --> 0:24:48,68
and things are going to go well


522
0:24:48,68 --> 0:24:51,279
that cost totally against the grain


523
0:24:51,279 --> 0:24:52,41
of scripture


524
0:24:52,41 --> 0:24:57,47
and particularly this parable not so
that we find in matthew chapter ten


525
0:24:57,47 --> 0:24:59,41
and beginning with verse


526
0:24:59,41 --> 0:25:1,0
thirty-four


527
0:25:1,0 --> 0:25:3,18
jesus says this


528
0:25:3,18 --> 0:25:6,52
think that i came to bring peace unrest


529
0:25:6,52 --> 0:25:11,18
i did not come to bring this by the
sword that's sound strange coming from


530
0:25:11,18 --> 0:25:13,75
blitz is jesus is indeed the prince of
peace


531
0:25:13,75 --> 0:25:15,679

events cummings will be balls up his own
household


536

those individuals

0:25:46,92 --> 0:25:48,45
cool here at work


541
0:25:48,45 --> 0:25:49,789
they get excited


542
0:25:49,789 --> 0:25:54,309
they think everything is gonna be a good
everything is gonna be prosperity


543
0:25:54,309 --> 0:25:58,35
they have a divided art they haven't
totally given up on self they have very


544
0:25:58,35 --> 0:26:2,59
little lost your of the holy spirit in
their lives


545
0:26:2,59 --> 0:26:5,13
they have a stocky heart and aside


546
0:26:5,13 --> 0:26:6,79

547
0:26:6,79 --> 0:26:9,59

548
0:26:9,59 --> 0:26:11,2
by the wayside


549
0:26:11,2 --> 0:26:12,62
and ultimately


550
0:26:12,62 --> 0:26:15,26
are lost


551
0:26:15,26 --> 0:26:19,669
you know several years ago while i was
teaching in our our university in


552
0:26:19,669 --> 0:26:21,88
colombia


553
0:26:21,88 --> 0:26:25,58
there was this young lady that came to
our theological school she came to study


554
0:26:25,58 --> 0:26:28,779
is a bible instructor her name plus a
female mendes


555
0:26:28,779 --> 0:26:32,309
she was involved in an accident and she
died a few years ago


556
0:26:32,309 --> 0:26:34,12
but she came to our school


557
0:26:34,12 --> 0:26:37,57
and uh... you know i tried to get close
to the students and find out about their


558
0:26:37,57 --> 0:26:38,96
background and so


559
0:26:38,96 --> 0:26:42,16
one day i was sitting under the trees
there another dimension


560
0:26:42,16 --> 0:26:46,92
uh... you know she came and sat down we
started talking as she told me her story


561
0:26:46,92 --> 0:26:50,95
she's ed pastor aryan i'd lived in this
town in colonial remember the name of


562
0:26:50,95 --> 0:26:53,21
the town burned in this town in colombia


563
0:26:53,21 --> 0:26:56,83
and uh... there are received and ellen
the mail that they were going to have


564
0:26:56,83 --> 0:26:59,1
uh... this series of meetings


565
0:26:59,1 --> 0:27:3,419
and saw uh... i decided that i would go
to that series of meetings even though i


566
0:27:3,419 --> 0:27:4,18
did


567
0:27:4,18 --> 0:27:7,52
but i didn't know anything about the
church where the rabin held i didn't


568
0:27:7,52 --> 0:27:9,16
know anything about the speaker


569
0:27:9,16 --> 0:27:10,299
but god


570
0:27:10,299 --> 0:27:12,19
opening night i went to the meetings


571
0:27:12,19 --> 0:27:14,64
there was an evangelistic series you can
guess


572
0:27:14,64 --> 0:27:17,74
and so she went for the whole
evangelistic series


573
0:27:17,74 --> 0:27:21,27
and at the end of the series he decided
that she would be the attached


574
0:27:21,27 --> 0:27:23,349
insult she went home


575
0:27:23,349 --> 0:27:25,99
and she told her parents i've been going
to these meetings


576
0:27:25,99 --> 0:27:29,75
and uh... i believe that the truth is
being proclaimed their they ask you what


577
0:27:29,75 --> 0:27:33,29
churches that is that the catholic
church he said no on if the seventh


578
0:27:33,29 --> 0:27:38,38
adventist church and uh... immediately
the parents frantz calden frowns and


579
0:27:38,38 --> 0:27:41,87
says you've been going to the seventh
evidence church she said yes


580
0:27:41,87 --> 0:27:45,73
and i've been hearing these wonderful
messages and i believe that's the truth


581
0:27:45,73 --> 0:27:49,47
and i've made my decision to be back on
ste


582
0:27:49,47 --> 0:27:51,81
her father looked at her and he said


583
0:27:51,81 --> 0:27:53,23
a subpoena


584
0:27:53,23 --> 0:27:55,91
if u get baptized


585
0:27:55,91 --> 0:28:0,33
you don't have a father and mother


586
0:28:0,33 --> 0:28:2,89
we're all this are you


587
0:28:2,89 --> 0:28:6,159
and also been a lot better father
insisted father i love you the bible


588
0:28:6,159 --> 0:28:9,7
says that we're supposed to honor our
father my mother


589
0:28:9,7 --> 0:28:14,13
but i told my allegiance first of my
heavenly father


590
0:28:14,13 --> 0:28:17,1
and therefore i'm going to go through
with this


591
0:28:17,1 --> 0:28:20,71
i'm going to be baptized on
such-and-such a day


592
0:28:20,71 --> 0:28:23,95
and her father xavier baptized on that
date


593
0:28:23,95 --> 0:28:26,86
united daughter you can't live here
anymore


594
0:28:26,86 --> 0:28:28,179
she went to the church


595
0:28:28,179 --> 0:28:29,87
she got baptized


596
0:28:29,87 --> 0:28:33,3
her parents knew about because they were
checking it out


597
0:28:33,3 --> 0:28:35,26
when ha subpoena came home


598
0:28:35,26 --> 0:28:39,55
all of our few belongings were on the
front door step of the house


599
0:28:39,55 --> 0:28:42,94
entered at matter at the door and he
said also fiat


600
0:28:42,94 --> 0:28:48,42

601
0:28:48,42 --> 0:28:50,529
and she said i'm sorry father


602
0:28:50,529 --> 0:28:52,99
i love you very much


603
0:28:52,99 --> 0:28:57,59
but i must obey god rather than men and
that includes my own parents


604
0:28:57,59 --> 0:29:0,96
and she came to the school she did have
anyplace to go


605
0:29:0,96 --> 0:29:3,789
and that's why she came and decide to
study at the school


606
0:29:3,789 --> 0:29:9,17
she became a bible worker she married a
seventh-day adventist pastor


607
0:29:9,17 --> 0:29:12,12
and by the way her parents never
accepted the message


608
0:29:12,12 --> 0:29:13,36
as far as i know


609
0:29:13,36 --> 0:29:14,76
she was disloyal


610
0:29:14,76 --> 0:29:17,39
for the rest of her life


611
0:29:17,39 --> 0:29:22,15
she did not receive the work like this
stalini ground here is


612
0:29:22,15 --> 0:29:24,71
army went revelation came and the fact


613
0:29:24,71 --> 0:29:26,249
directly against her


614
0:29:26,249 --> 0:29:27,13
she says


615
0:29:27,13 --> 0:29:30,48
mileage and spears with god


616
0:29:30,48 --> 0:29:34,66
by a personal and a superficial religion
with very little holy spirit a very


617
0:29:34,66 --> 0:29:38,16
little moisture because the monitor
represents the holy spirit


618
0:29:38,16 --> 0:29:38,809
what


619
0:29:38,809 --> 0:29:40,749
they followed by the wayside


620
0:29:40,749 --> 0:29:41,669
and said


621
0:29:41,669 --> 0:29:43,8
oh laughs values


622
0:29:43,8 --> 0:29:45,7
i can have my foot


623
0:29:45,7 --> 0:29:49,76
outlier kids make i can't have my fellow
workers against me hike at my friend's


624
0:29:49,76 --> 0:29:50,679
against me


625
0:29:50,679 --> 0:29:51,83
and in full


626
0:29:51,83 --> 0:29:53,46
by the wayside


627
0:29:53,46 --> 0:29:58,309
by the way did you know that judas it's
scary it fits in this category


628
0:29:58,309 --> 0:30:1,68
i'm not going to read a passage brandon
matthew eight verses eighteen to twenty


629
0:30:1,68 --> 0:30:3,62
two


630
0:30:3,62 --> 0:30:7,27
there's a certain scribe it comes to
jesus and he says to him i'll follow you


631
0:30:7,27 --> 0:30:11,8
wherever you go


632
0:30:11,8 --> 0:30:14,93
that was yours


633
0:30:14,93 --> 0:30:17,92
jesus tried to discourage him because
you know it's hard


634
0:30:17,92 --> 0:30:19,45
says


635
0:30:19,45 --> 0:30:21,99
barracks at mass


636
0:30:21,99 --> 0:30:24,5
foxes have holes


637
0:30:24,5 --> 0:30:28,64
but the son of man doesn't have anyplace
delays it


638
0:30:28,64 --> 0:30:31,32
what jesus was saying to him as a look


639
0:30:31,32 --> 0:30:33,18
if you're if i don't mean


640
0:30:33,18 --> 0:30:36,19
for those also that this is


641
0:30:36,19 --> 0:30:38,87
no i'm not going down the wrong road


642
0:30:38,87 --> 0:30:42,85
because i don't have any prosperity and
all that money and i don't have anything


643
0:30:42,85 --> 0:30:46,62
to offer your in terms of material
prosperity


644
0:30:46,62 --> 0:30:49,85
if you follow me for that reason forgave


645
0:30:49,85 --> 0:30:52,309
do you know if you look at the context
of that passage


646
0:30:52,309 --> 0:30:56,529
you're going to find that judas offered
to follow jesus


647
0:30:56,529 --> 0:30:59,83
when jesus was popular


648
0:30:59,83 --> 0:31:3,37
multitudes were following jesus


649
0:31:3,37 --> 0:31:7,63
a people were excited because jesus was
healing diseases and he was fading


650
0:31:7,63 --> 0:31:9,419
thousands of people


651
0:31:9,419 --> 0:31:10,17
it's a lot


652
0:31:10,17 --> 0:31:13,75
out this is the guide that we want to be
with but then we just are preaching the


653
0:31:13,75 --> 0:31:14,82
word


654
0:31:14,82 --> 0:31:16,61
accorded the judge after six


655
0:31:16,61 --> 0:31:20,12
only the disciples were left


656
0:31:20,12 --> 0:31:23,539
and jesus says are you going to leave
too


657
0:31:23,539 --> 0:31:27,97
empiricism lowered if we leave work and
we go


658
0:31:27,97 --> 0:31:29,7
you have miracles


659
0:31:29,7 --> 0:31:31,82
so what readers at


660
0:31:31,82 --> 0:31:33,25
you have what


661
0:31:33,25 --> 0:31:37,13
you have works


662
0:31:37,13 --> 0:31:40,22
see peter he said many things without
thinking


663
0:31:40,22 --> 0:31:42,7
but this was one good thing that he said


664
0:31:42,7 --> 0:31:47,2
yes i do you have not goes and signs and
wonders he says you path


665
0:31:47,2 --> 0:31:49,38
but why arts of life


666
0:31:49,38 --> 0:31:52,97
everybody else left because i would no
longer in our cause


667
0:31:52,97 --> 0:31:53,889
but peter


668
0:31:53,889 --> 0:31:55,13
headed straight


669
0:31:55,13 --> 0:31:57,67
and so we have two kinds of soil


670
0:31:57,67 --> 0:32:1,3
those by the wayside who don't respond
at all when the worries preached they


671
0:32:1,3 --> 0:32:4,35
showed no religious interest


672
0:32:4,35 --> 0:32:5,359
saket


673
0:32:5,359 --> 0:32:8,21
the laws on the stony ground they have a
superficial


674
0:32:8,21 --> 0:32:10,1
acceptance of the truth


675
0:32:10,1 --> 0:32:12,44
part rock


676
0:32:12,44 --> 0:32:15,98
there also and partnered soiled part
jesus


677
0:32:15,98 --> 0:32:20,78
trying to sacto masters accepting jesus
at that time of emotion and feeling


678
0:32:20,78 --> 0:32:22,29
tribulations com


679
0:32:22,29 --> 0:32:24,38
they fall by the wayside


680
0:32:24,38 --> 0:32:26,88
but there's a third type afzal


681
0:32:26,88 --> 0:32:29,95
and that is the seed that fail


682
0:32:29,95 --> 0:32:30,61
among the


683
0:32:30,61 --> 0:32:32,59
form


684
0:32:32,59 --> 0:32:34,38
used to have a good sign


685
0:32:34,38 --> 0:32:35,95
but there were a farce


686
0:32:35,95 --> 0:32:39,44
not a salute chapter eight inverse
fourteen


687
0:32:39,44 --> 0:32:46,289
luke chapter eight inverse fourteen
describes this current of soil


688
0:32:46,289 --> 0:32:47,59
it says there


689
0:32:47,59 --> 0:32:50,63
invoke chapter eight inverse fourteen


690
0:32:50,63 --> 0:32:53,57
the following


691
0:32:53,57 --> 0:32:55,72
now the winds that fail amato


692
0:32:55,72 --> 0:32:57,509
forums


693
0:32:57,509 --> 0:33:0,26
i've always cool


694
0:33:0,26 --> 0:33:2,46
have heard sleeping here also


695
0:33:2,46 --> 0:33:5,65
well they have heard it


696
0:33:5,65 --> 0:33:8,259
gault


697
0:33:8,259 --> 0:33:10,259
and are what


698
0:33:10,259 --> 0:33:13,53
anike shopped


699
0:33:13,53 --> 0:33:15,45
by what


700
0:33:15,45 --> 0:33:17,71
with perris


701
0:33:17,71 --> 0:33:22,6
by the way if you go up to the gospel
uh... of mark


702
0:33:22,6 --> 0:33:25,309
chapter four inverse nineteen it adds an
ex-president says


703
0:33:25,309 --> 0:33:29,519
by the kerry's obvious world


704
0:33:29,519 --> 0:33:34,85
it adds that by the cares of this world
you know because of this world arc


705
0:33:34,85 --> 0:33:37,1
wanting to accumulate houses


706
0:33:37,1 --> 0:33:38,73
and cards


707
0:33:38,73 --> 0:33:41,59
and money in stocks and bonds


708
0:33:41,59 --> 0:33:44,65
in wanting to work two jobs


709
0:33:44,65 --> 0:33:46,91
things that are not bad and themselves


710
0:33:46,91 --> 0:33:52,87
but with jobs all or part time and
effort


711
0:33:52,87 --> 0:33:54,42
that's part of the forms


712
0:33:54,42 --> 0:33:56,2
that care is of this life


713
0:33:56,2 --> 0:34:1,669
not us once again uh... looked chapter
eight and verse fourteen


714
0:34:1,669 --> 0:34:3,2
it says


715
0:34:3,2 --> 0:34:7,73
now the ones that felt among the
florence and also wet may have heard got


716
0:34:7,73 --> 0:34:9,5
out an art shot with a care


717
0:34:9,5 --> 0:34:12,889
this of this world if you compare mark


718
0:34:12,889 --> 0:34:14,619
what else


719
0:34:14,619 --> 0:34:20,219
actually mark says with that d_c_
fullness of riches


720
0:34:20,219 --> 0:34:24,419
so that's why you have to compare all
three gospels because it's one expresses


721
0:34:24,419 --> 0:34:26,479
that a little differently


722
0:34:26,479 --> 0:34:27,339
riches


723
0:34:27,339 --> 0:34:28,689
is that the e_c_


724
0:34:28,689 --> 0:34:30,349
formats of riches


725
0:34:30,349 --> 0:34:32,139
and then something else


726
0:34:32,139 --> 0:34:33,589
and a lot


727
0:34:33,589 --> 0:34:34,44
and apply


728
0:34:34,44 --> 0:34:37,19
fisher's out alive


729
0:34:37,19 --> 0:34:40,159
and bring no proof


730
0:34:40,159 --> 0:34:42,169
to maturity


731
0:34:42,169 --> 0:34:46,639
the florence by the way what the forums
represent in scripture


732
0:34:46,639 --> 0:34:50,499
you remember in genesis chapter three
adverse eighteen


733
0:34:50,499 --> 0:34:54,509
what came in consequence of sin


734
0:34:54,509 --> 0:34:58,209
god said car scares the ground for your
state


735
0:34:58,209 --> 0:35:3,69
in talking would you show event although
days of your life


736
0:35:3,69 --> 0:35:4,41
and at what does he say


737
0:35:4,41 --> 0:35:6,78
both clarence and fred souls


738
0:35:6,78 --> 0:35:8,27
it shall bring forth


739
0:35:8,27 --> 0:35:9,769
for you


740
0:35:9,769 --> 0:35:11,82
foreign census vessels


741
0:35:11,82 --> 0:35:13,16
represent


742
0:35:13,16 --> 0:35:15,459
saying


743
0:35:15,459 --> 0:35:16,999
it comes in


744
0:35:16,999 --> 0:35:19,829
the pleasures of this world


745
0:35:19,829 --> 0:35:20,889
dot


746
0:35:20,889 --> 0:35:22,479
of this life


747
0:35:22,479 --> 0:35:27,559
that decided for mass aldrich is scott
and and they chaal


748
0:35:27,559 --> 0:35:28,709
the plant


749
0:35:28,709 --> 0:35:31,599
which has begun to grow


750
0:35:31,599 --> 0:35:35,359
now we have been brutal examples of this
we have a rich young rumor that came to


751
0:35:35,359 --> 0:35:37,419
geez


752
0:35:37,419 --> 0:35:41,519
do you know the bible says that jesus
loved this young man


753
0:35:41,519 --> 0:35:44,939
he seems easiest blessing the children


754
0:35:44,939 --> 0:35:47,45
missus i'd love that they look at how
the children


755
0:35:47,45 --> 0:35:49,569
i've drawn


756
0:35:49,569 --> 0:35:51,749
so he comes to jesus


757
0:35:51,749 --> 0:35:54,39
and he says what do i need to do to have
eternal life juices will keep the


758
0:35:54,39 --> 0:35:55,539
commitments


759
0:35:55,539 --> 0:35:56,959
he says which


760
0:35:56,959 --> 0:35:58,299
so then jesus quotes


761
0:35:58,299 --> 0:36:0,929
the last table of a lot


762
0:36:0,929 --> 0:36:2,819
and the address es i've done all these


763
0:36:2,819 --> 0:36:5,789
thanks since i was a young boy


764
0:36:5,789 --> 0:36:8,139
what part of it


765
0:36:8,139 --> 0:36:9,61
and jesus looks at him


766
0:36:9,61 --> 0:36:11,769
and he says


767
0:36:11,769 --> 0:36:13,729
you would be perfect


768
0:36:13,729 --> 0:36:16,529
gold sales all that you have


769
0:36:16,529 --> 0:36:19,909
and give it to the poor


770
0:36:19,909 --> 0:36:24,9
and you will have treasure with me in
heaven come follow me


771
0:36:24,9 --> 0:36:25,549
and the bible says


772
0:36:25,549 --> 0:36:30,329
that this young man left


773
0:36:30,329 --> 0:36:31,609
southville


774
0:36:31,609 --> 0:36:33,569
because he had a lot


775
0:36:33,569 --> 0:36:35,919
because he had


776
0:36:35,919 --> 0:36:38,369
possessions


777
0:36:38,369 --> 0:36:42,549
did he allowed the d_c_ fullness of
riches to choke


778
0:36:42,549 --> 0:36:44,299
the seat in his heart


779
0:36:44,299 --> 0:36:49,41
you know folks as as seventy evidence
precios many times you say although i'm


780
0:36:49,41 --> 0:36:55,429
not a slave to money i have no problems
of money i can handle it


781
0:36:55,429 --> 0:36:57,239
and yet what are we doing


782
0:36:57,239 --> 0:37:1,969
work too hard waiting finance dept were
not that we don't really need


783
0:37:1,969 --> 0:37:3,609
isn't that right


784
0:37:3,609 --> 0:37:5,769
doing it for houses


785
0:37:5,769 --> 0:37:7,399
to live in


786
0:37:7,399 --> 0:37:8,979
doing actually we


787
0:37:8,979 --> 0:37:11,659
for automobiles


788
0:37:11,659 --> 0:37:13,649
don't actually need


789
0:37:13,649 --> 0:37:16,37
tens of thousands at first


790
0:37:16,37 --> 0:37:19,359
files on some balance and the bank


791
0:37:19,359 --> 0:37:22,109
while the work of god is languishing


792
0:37:22,109 --> 0:37:24,7
do you know that i miss coming when
people are gonna cry out


793
0:37:24,7 --> 0:37:28,98
why didn't i use my money why didn't i
invest my money in the kingdom of god


794
0:37:28,98 --> 0:37:30,69
defer that the gospel


795
0:37:30,69 --> 0:37:33,23
why did i acutally for myself


796
0:37:33,23 --> 0:37:35,779
when we won't be able to buy and sell


797
0:37:35,779 --> 0:37:36,91
people are going to say that


798
0:37:36,91 --> 0:37:38,62
but it's going to be too late


799
0:37:38,62 --> 0:37:41,289
the d_c_ fullness of riches


800
0:37:41,289 --> 0:37:43,499
has been the ruin


801
0:37:43,499 --> 0:37:45,63
of their soul


802
0:37:45,63 --> 0:37:48,719
by the way the apostle paul had
something very interesting to say first


803
0:37:48,719 --> 0:37:51,519
timothy chapter six verses nine and ten


804
0:37:51,519 --> 0:37:55,809
first timothy chapter six versus nine
and ten the apostle paul had something


805
0:37:55,809 --> 0:38:0,339
very interesting to say about money
analogical reed had to read it carefully


806
0:38:0,339 --> 0:38:1,639
with me


807
0:38:1,639 --> 0:38:2,8
because i'm


808
0:38:2,8 --> 0:38:6,79
some people misread it they get the
impression that riches abit ridges are


809
0:38:6,79 --> 0:38:8,329
not bad


810
0:38:8,329 --> 0:38:13,309
notice what the apostle paul says in
first timothy chapter six converse nine


811
0:38:13,309 --> 0:38:17,739
but also desire to be rates lotus is not
even say the rates because a lot of the


812
0:38:17,739 --> 0:38:18,919
rich


813
0:38:18,919 --> 0:38:22,189
but also a desire to be rich


814
0:38:22,189 --> 0:38:25,5
did temptations and a lot


815
0:38:25,5 --> 0:38:27,489
a smear


816
0:38:27,489 --> 0:38:29,63
an internet foliage and ha


817
0:38:29,63 --> 0:38:31,33
default lasts


818
0:38:31,33 --> 0:38:35,2
which drowned and in destruction and
producers


819
0:38:35,2 --> 0:38:38,609

and they're always thinking about making
mark and investing more


836

and i know we paid lip service to this
folks


885
0:41:48,61 --> 0:41:52,9
do you believe that we're living in the
last moments of human history


886
0:41:52,9 --> 0:41:54,469
this in as we look at what's happening
in the world


887
0:41:54,469 --> 0:41:58,42
i can't help but my revel in the last
couple of weeks what we've been seeing


888
0:41:58,42 --> 0:42:3,529
how the united states is fulfilling the
prophecy of revelation thirty in the


889
0:42:3,529 --> 0:42:5,49
initial stages at least


890
0:42:5,49 --> 0:42:11,769
and how all of the questions are coming
together with a common attend dot


891
0:42:11,769 --> 0:42:14,569
it stopped we are as practically clear


892
0:42:14,569 --> 0:42:18,259
the question is what are we doing with
the resources that god has given us


893
0:42:18,259 --> 0:42:19,489
are we


894
0:42:19,489 --> 0:42:23,239
investing please and the cause of
dinosaur well pastor bar you just want


895
0:42:23,239 --> 0:42:26,129

896
0:42:26,129 --> 0:42:28,859
well let me tell you the private comes
here to this church


897
0:42:28,859 --> 0:42:31,89
but you know which in none of it comes
into my pocket


898
0:42:31,89 --> 0:42:33,809
it all goes to a central location


899
0:42:33,809 --> 0:42:36,2
and then they pay all of the pastors


900
0:42:36,2 --> 0:42:38,46
anat equitable basis


901
0:42:38,46 --> 0:42:42,559
i don't receive any of the offerings
that come into the church the offerings


902
0:42:42,559 --> 0:42:45,549
golfer the writing of this church for
the preaching of the gospel for


903
0:42:45,549 --> 0:42:48,28
evangelistic meetings for health
seminars


904
0:42:48,28 --> 0:42:51,69
for all of these things which have the
intent on reaching people with the got


905
0:42:51,69 --> 0:42:52,819
school


906
0:42:52,819 --> 0:42:56,539
and i pray to god that we will late
everything we have time to talk to have


907
0:42:56,539 --> 0:43:0,809
sacrificed because soon it might be too
late


908
0:43:0,809 --> 0:43:2,85
we need to wake up from a slumber


909
0:43:2,85 --> 0:43:5,799
we better not call not too long


910
0:43:5,799 --> 0:43:6,67
we've got it


911
0:43:6,67 --> 0:43:8,8
who aren't too long


912
0:43:8,8 --> 0:43:9,299
it's time to get up


913
0:43:9,299 --> 0:43:12,969
and make a sacrifice regard as i
mentioned in one of the previous


914
0:43:12,969 --> 0:43:13,999
lectures


915
0:43:13,999 --> 0:43:15,529
the little window


916
0:43:15,529 --> 0:43:17,92
she comes in chief closer to mike sin


917
0:43:17,92 --> 0:43:21,609
jesus says she gave more than all of us
will be a great a great sums


918
0:43:21,609 --> 0:43:22,839
and explain why


919
0:43:22,839 --> 0:43:24,229
he says because


920
0:43:24,229 --> 0:43:28,39
came out of their abundance and others i
get what they have leftover what they


921
0:43:28,39 --> 0:43:28,88
really didn't


922
0:43:28,88 --> 0:43:31,83
eight but she gave all


923
0:43:31,83 --> 0:43:32,71
that she had


924
0:43:32,71 --> 0:43:34,53
her only system


925
0:43:34,53 --> 0:43:36,289
it's


926
0:43:36,289 --> 0:43:37,91
and so we have jesus said


927
0:43:37,91 --> 0:43:40,16
by the way in looked after twenty one
thirty four


928
0:43:40,16 --> 0:43:45,46
he says make sure that your heart is not
weighed down by carousing drunkenness


929
0:43:45,46 --> 0:43:49,96
and the cares obvious life death that
day come upon you


930
0:43:49,96 --> 0:43:51,7
unexpectedly


931
0:43:51,7 --> 0:43:55,91
an easy kill chapter seven burst
nineteen we're told that in the day when


932
0:43:55,91 --> 0:43:59,319
the wrath of god is poured out upon this
world


933
0:43:59,319 --> 0:44:3,49
people attacked their called and their
silver and they will find


934
0:44:3,49 --> 0:44:5,549
hence on the streets


935
0:44:5,549 --> 0:44:8,469
and there are saying what does this
world


936
0:44:8,469 --> 0:44:13,41
we return only lost what good is that i
have all of these things silver and gold


937
0:44:13,41 --> 0:44:17,21
will be absolutely worthless


938
0:44:17,21 --> 0:44:21,399
and so we have three different kinds of
people so far that we stay


939
0:44:21,399 --> 0:44:24,299
number one they hear the word


940
0:44:24,299 --> 0:44:25,409
be rejected


941
0:44:25,409 --> 0:44:27,539
doesn't even begin to germany


942
0:44:27,539 --> 0:44:28,859
number two


943
0:44:28,859 --> 0:44:31,49
those individual so here's alert


944
0:44:31,49 --> 0:44:35,69
and in a moment of emotion they accept
that they say this is wonderful


945
0:44:35,69 --> 0:44:38,649
and that relations com


946
0:44:38,649 --> 0:44:41,789
the sun comes out and beats on the
planet


947
0:44:41,789 --> 0:44:43,149
impacts


948
0:44:43,149 --> 0:44:44,669
then you have balls


949
0:44:44,669 --> 0:44:46,909
they are on foreign soil


950
0:44:46,909 --> 0:44:52,489
for whom the d_c_ elissa preachers
riches the terracotta this life


951
0:44:52,489 --> 0:44:57,749
strangle the seed that has been planted
the plant that is beginning to grow


952
0:44:57,749 --> 0:45:1,819
but i thank god that there's one other
kind of slow


953
0:45:1,819 --> 0:45:4,309
and that is the good summer


954
0:45:4,309 --> 0:45:10,849
norris what we find in the gospel of
luke chapter eight and versus fifteen


955
0:45:10,849 --> 0:45:12,42
luke chapter eight


956
0:45:12,42 --> 0:45:13,359

0:45:15,879 --> 0:45:18,349
we find out there


959
0:45:18,349 --> 0:45:22,279
the following words luke eight inverse
fifteen


960
0:45:22,279 --> 0:45:26,399

0:48:22,93 --> 0:48:24,919

1030

0:48:42,559 --> 0:48:45,969
jesus is not everyone who says to me


1037

lord lord


1038
0:48:47,1 --> 0:48:48,819

but he who does that will have my father
in heaven was if not only hearing but a


1042
0:48:59,779 --> 0:49:0,879
lot


1043
0:49:0,879 --> 0:49:3,89
doing if not only saying


1044

and done many wonders in your name


1051

by the way were these christians


1052
0:49:21,289 --> 0:49:24,669
why would they be doing it in the name
of jesus if they were christians


1053
0:49:24,669 --> 0:49:26,789
out this week the questions


1054
0:49:26,789 --> 0:49:28,739
so what is jesus was right


1055
0:49:28,739 --> 0:49:30,7
and then i will declare to them


1056
0:49:30,7 --> 0:49:32,729
i never ignore you


1057
0:49:32,729 --> 0:49:36,7
d part from maine you know who practice


1058
0:49:36,7 --> 0:49:39,979
lawlessness and then jesus gives an
example


1059
0:49:39,979 --> 0:49:40,98
the parable


1060
0:49:40,98 --> 0:49:43,98
of the man who built this house up on
the rock and the man who built this


1061
0:49:43,98 --> 0:49:45,16
house upon the saint


1062
0:49:45,16 --> 0:49:49,259
we even sing about this in summer school
do you still saying this is our school


1063
0:49:49,259 --> 0:49:53,769
the wiseman builtin spouse upon the rock

1064
0:49:53,769 --> 0:49:54,4
song


1065
0:49:54,4 --> 0:49:55,549

1066
0:49:55,549 --> 0:49:57,729
style of a child at heart


1067
0:49:57,729 --> 0:50:2,519
but anyway jesus gives a parable abotu
builders


1068
0:50:2,519 --> 0:50:5,439
who is the one who builds on the rock
and it was the one who builds on the


1069
0:50:5,439 --> 0:50:6,49
sand


1070
0:50:6,49 --> 0:50:7,46

1071
0:50:7,46 --> 0:50:9,179

1077
0:50:21,89 --> 0:50:25,64
therefore whoever hears these things of

1078
0:50:25,64 --> 0:50:31,289
i would like him him to our wiseman who
built his house out a lot


1079
0:50:31,289 --> 0:50:33,43
on the rock


1080
0:50:33,43 --> 0:50:35,909
and the rain descended the floods came


1081
0:50:35,909 --> 0:50:37,579
words blue and


1082
0:50:37,579 --> 0:50:38,509
on that house


1083
0:50:38,509 --> 0:50:39,97
and it did not fall


1084
0:50:39,97 --> 0:50:44,589
four it was founded on the rock what
does that mean to be found on the rock


1085
0:50:44,589 --> 0:50:51,639
it means that you'll be here are the
words of jesus and what and through them


1086
0:50:51,639 --> 0:50:54,929
now morris what about the man who build
on the same


1087
0:50:54,929 --> 0:50:56,42
verse twenty six


1088
0:50:56,42 --> 0:50:59,97
but everyone who hears these sayings of
mine and does not


1089
0:50:59,97 --> 0:51:1,639
do them


1090
0:51:1,639 --> 0:51:5,64
will be like a policeman who built his
house on the senate


1091
0:51:5,64 --> 0:51:9,129
and the rain descended the flags came in
the winds blew


1092
0:51:9,129 --> 0:51:9,869
and


1093
0:51:9,869 --> 0:51:10,839
on that house


1094
0:51:10,839 --> 0:51:12,259
and it fail


1095
0:51:12,259 --> 0:51:15,94
and great


1096
0:51:15,94 --> 0:51:19,479
by the way these verses are speaking
about the tribulations that is coming up


1097
0:51:19,479 --> 0:51:20,999
on the world


1098
0:51:20,999 --> 0:51:24,279
flooring tiles are hoping the far went
on strike


1099
0:51:24,279 --> 0:51:28,799
why are we ask you at the storm dot com
installer


1100
0:51:28,799 --> 0:51:30,529
and all the calls who here


1101
0:51:30,529 --> 0:51:31,76
or words of jesus


1102
0:51:31,76 --> 0:51:33,289
and two of them


1103
0:51:33,289 --> 0:51:34,659
will be safe


1104
0:51:34,659 --> 0:51:37,249
in that great day


1105
0:51:37,249 --> 0:51:38,91
i'd like to take the last


1106
0:51:38,91 --> 0:51:41,119
few moments that we have


1107
0:51:41,119 --> 0:51:46,119
to talk about the process of god
planting the seed in the so little of


1108
0:51:46,119 --> 0:51:48,109
our hearts


1109
0:51:48,109 --> 0:51:49,54
how this god


1110
0:51:49,54 --> 0:51:50,979
do it


1111
0:51:50,979 --> 0:51:53,669
well listen to what i'm gonna sing


1112
0:51:53,669 --> 0:51:55,209
the cd


1113
0:51:55,209 --> 0:51:57,139
is a word of god


1114
0:51:57,139 --> 0:51:59,79
we've already studied


1115
0:51:59,79 --> 0:52:1,589
the word of god is preached


1116
0:52:1,589 --> 0:52:5,559
and what that means is that god is
taking the seed and he's putting it


1117
0:52:5,559 --> 0:52:6,639
where


1118
0:52:6,639 --> 0:52:9,18
he's planting the seed in the heart


1119
0:52:9,18 --> 0:52:13,49
by the way faith comes by hearing and
hearing by what


1120
0:52:13,49 --> 0:52:15,44
by the word of god


1121
0:52:15,44 --> 0:52:18,519
what happens with people who are not
into the word of god


1122
0:52:18,519 --> 0:52:20,569
cornerstone can block plant


1123
0:52:20,569 --> 0:52:22,17
his seat in our hearts


1124
0:52:22,17 --> 0:52:24,609
if we're not studying the word


1125
0:52:24,609 --> 0:52:26,69
absolutely not


1126
0:52:26,69 --> 0:52:29,869
because god speaks to our hearts to the
word


1127
0:52:29,869 --> 0:52:31,79
but now we're starting to work


1128
0:52:31,79 --> 0:52:36,99
but mark dot plants his will antecedent
in our hearts


1129
0:52:36,99 --> 0:52:38,239
antennae morrison's


1130
0:52:38,239 --> 0:52:40,339
the ground where black


1131
0:52:40,339 --> 0:52:43,279
with but do out his holy spirit


1132
0:52:43,279 --> 0:52:46,559
and i'm mark time that i suspect or


1133
0:52:46,559 --> 0:52:47,639
the longer


1134
0:52:47,639 --> 0:52:50,189
the plant grows


1135
0:52:50,189 --> 0:52:52,69
ever continue in this process


1136
0:52:52,69 --> 0:52:57,2
eve actually what's gonna happen is that
plant is going to go out to into a tree


1137
0:52:57,2 --> 0:53:0,379
and victory eventually is going to bear
whacked


1138
0:53:0,379 --> 0:53:2,399
is going to be here


1139
0:53:2,399 --> 0:53:4,709
and by the way what is the fruit


1140
0:53:4,709 --> 0:53:7,149
though it may delay since chapter five


1141
0:53:7,149 --> 0:53:9,409
galatians chapter five


1142
0:53:9,409 --> 0:53:12,889
and i would like to begin reading
adverse nineteen


1143
0:53:12,889 --> 0:53:17,349
uh... well actually let's let's begin
reading adverse twenty-one ending about


1144
0:53:17,349 --> 0:53:18,69
though works of the flesh


1145
0:53:18,69 --> 0:53:21,38
and the murders drunkenness rebel armies
and the like


1146
0:53:21,38 --> 0:53:23,3
which i tell you beforehand


1147
0:53:23,3 --> 0:53:25,579
just as i also told your diet
basketballs


1148
0:53:25,579 --> 0:53:29,69
who practice such things will not
inherit the kingdom of god


1149
0:53:29,69 --> 0:53:32,739
reticence about the fruit of the spirit
verse twenty two but the fruit of the


1150
0:53:32,739 --> 0:53:34,16
spirit is


1151
0:53:34,16 --> 0:53:35,949
love joy


1152
0:53:35,949 --> 0:53:36,72
piece


1153
0:53:36,72 --> 0:53:37,839
long suffering


1154
0:53:37,839 --> 0:53:38,78
kindness


1155
0:53:38,78 --> 0:53:39,629
goodness


1156
0:53:39,629 --> 0:53:45,399
faithfulness gentleman's self controlled


1157
0:53:45,399 --> 0:53:47,839
do you know what the fruit of the spirit
is


1158
0:53:47,839 --> 0:53:50,619
if the character of jesus


1159
0:53:50,619 --> 0:53:53,659
is is a description of the character
jesus


1160
0:53:53,659 --> 0:53:56,59
let's read again


1161
0:53:56,59 --> 0:53:57,89
it says


1162
0:53:57,89 --> 0:54:2,49
lob joint peace long-serving kindness
goodness faithfulness gentleness self


1163
0:54:2,49 --> 0:54:3,489
control


1164
0:54:3,489 --> 0:54:5,529
that's different


1165
0:54:5,529 --> 0:54:8,99
how does the front cover


1166
0:54:8,99 --> 0:54:11,709
do you have to plant before you artistic
uh... fruit


1167
0:54:11,709 --> 0:54:12,44
proceeded


1168
0:54:12,44 --> 0:54:14,9
so what does god do


1169
0:54:14,9 --> 0:54:17,289
he takes the scene of the truth he
planted in her heart the more that were


1170
0:54:17,289 --> 0:54:19,759
in the words studying the word
assimilating the work


1171
0:54:19,759 --> 0:54:20,809
god speaks to us


1172
0:54:20,809 --> 0:54:22,929
he placed the word in our hearts


1173
0:54:22,929 --> 0:54:25,179
through the influence of the holy spirit


1174
0:54:25,179 --> 0:54:26,94
that plaque begins to watch


1175
0:54:26,94 --> 0:54:30,1
to grow and eventually it produces in
our lives


1176
0:54:30,1 --> 0:54:31,23
the fruit of the spirit


1177
0:54:31,23 --> 0:54:36,419
in other ways it produces in our lives
that character of jesus


1178
0:54:36,419 --> 0:54:39,959
do you know we take the mold of the
character of that which we dedicate our


1179
0:54:39,959 --> 0:54:42,269
time too


1180
0:54:42,269 --> 0:54:44,369
you know this right


1181
0:54:44,369 --> 0:54:47,419
if we gotta get most of our time


1182
0:54:47,419 --> 0:54:52,709
music and well endeavors and television
and videos and all these things


1183
0:54:52,709 --> 0:54:55,319
what type of character regatta


1184
0:54:55,319 --> 0:54:57,329
we're going to reflect that character


1185
0:54:57,329 --> 0:55:0,74
but the market we allow the word of god
to enter through our allies


1186
0:55:0,74 --> 0:55:6,69
by bible study by listening to sermons
by watching three ibn


1187
0:55:6,69 --> 0:55:7,95
by watching sports all things


1188
0:55:7,95 --> 0:55:9,819
guard plants and seed in our hearts


1189
0:55:9,819 --> 0:55:14,8
the sea grows into a plaque then grows
into a tree and in our lives changed


1190
0:55:14,8 --> 0:55:20,649
because we had as a result the fruit of
the spirit appearing in our lives


1191
0:55:20,649 --> 0:55:23,489
which is christ likeness


1192
0:55:23,489 --> 0:55:26,599
the hope of glory incidentally


1193
0:55:26,599 --> 0:55:29,409
so we have four solar house


1194
0:55:29,409 --> 0:55:32,819
three of them will eventually be lost


1195
0:55:32,819 --> 0:55:36,649
one of them only will be saved in the
kingdom


1196
0:55:36,649 --> 0:55:42,89
what is the soil of your heart


1197
0:55:42,89 --> 0:55:43,629
are you


1198
0:55:43,629 --> 0:55:46,369
away side here


1199
0:55:46,369 --> 0:55:50,239
r_u_ any story ground here


1200
0:55:50,239 --> 0:55:52,519
are you


1201
0:55:52,519 --> 0:55:55,589

or are you a good salil


1203
0:56:0,429 --> 0:56:2,649
our decision


1204
0:56:2,649 --> 0:56:4,69
will determine


1205
0:56:4,69 --> 0:56:6,409
r_u_ ternal destiny


1206
0:56:6,409 --> 0:56:9,599
and folks let me finish with a positive
note


1207
0:56:9,599 --> 0:56:13,559
do you know that we're not stuck with
the heart that we have


1208
0:56:13,559 --> 0:56:18,659
god can't change the heart just look at
