###2 Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing.
###9 l can see.
###13 Come on. Let's get out of here. There's something to do.
###17 There's film festivals, theatre, there's museums.
###20 Let's get out and get some culture.
###23 Let's put Rowdy on top of the TV
###25 and see who can throw a hat on him first.
###27 <i>Turk turns everything</i> <i>into a competition,</i>
###30 <i>It can get annoying,</i>
###35 Let's play ''Steak''.
###37 The first person to finish their steak is the winner.
###40 l paid $1 7 for this steak, and l'm not...
###44 You want some?
###48 ''Ankles'' is a simple game.
###50 The first one to get embarrassed and pull up their scrubs loses.
###54 <i>The problem is these stupid games</i> <i>always end the same way,</i>
###60 Say it!
###63 Say it!
###69 Just say it.
###71 - l'm your bitch. - Yes, you are.
###74 Now, sit back baby, cos <i>Iron Chef</i> is on.
###93 - l win. - l wasn't racing.
###95 - l was just walking in. - Good clean win, T-Dog.
###97 Now, let's go down to the caf and get our doughnut on.
###101 lt wasn't a race!
###103 OK, fine! Let's just play...
###106 Let's play ''Tip Over the Trash Can''.
###108 OK? l win.
###112 - l win. - Can l play?
###119 - This is fun. - Yeah.
###123 Sorry to keep you, Mr Kelly. l was just...
###135 So, what, are you sick or something?
###139 My heartbeat, it's like, it's irregular.
###142 - What's the medical word? - lrregular.
###145 Yeah. That's it.
###147 Of course. The heart. The old ticker.
###151 You're my doctor?
###153 l have something for you in my pants.
###156 No. Not...
###158 l'm not wearing any pants right now.
###160 My pants are over there, and there's a note from my GP in the pocket.
###167 lf you guys need me, l'll be under here.
###170 l'm in love with that guy and if l don't sleep with him, l'll kill myself.
###175 lt's inappropriate to jump a patient, isn't it?
###178 - Totally. - Ever done it?
###179 - Tons of times. - ''Tons of times'' what?
###182 Nothing, baby.
###185 Why hasn't he had a surgical consult? l'm sorry. That's my fault.
###188 l didn't make it clear how l feel about things that should already be done.
###193 l almost always wish things were done already.
###197 Mr Hoffner asked for all his options.
###200 - He never asked for a surgical consult. - Could l have a surgical consult?
###204 You may have whatever you want.
###208 How is that helpful? Do you get the doctor-patient relationship?
###212 We're supposed to be a team.
###214 You and me? We're gonna get killed.
###221 For the love of Our Lady of Guadalupe, that is a fine brew.
###225 - lt's just coffee. - Oh, no.
###228 This is liquid crack. This is a mug full of sunshine.
###231 My dear, for me, this is like sex.
###235 ls that why you always finish so quickly?
###238 And sassy too. lf you could cook a steak,
###240 l'd eat it right off your bottom.
###242 Ladies. This is that beverage l've been trying to describe to you,
###248 and it turns out, this is weird,
###250 but the secret is, you grind it from beans, not crap.
###253 l'll grind your beans.
###256 When are we gonna get it over with?
###259 We are already understaffed, and Dr Kelso fired two nurses for no reason.
###264 Forgive us if we don't have time for the Dr Cox show today.
###268 We have to reschedule every nurse.
###271 - What'll we do about lCU... - We don't need them.
###274 <i>Here's the problem</i> <i>with a surgical consult,</i>
###277 <i>Mr Hoffner should be treated medically</i> <i>but a surgeon will want to slice him,</i>
###281 <i>Surgical and medical interns</i> <i>are like two rival gangs,</i>
###285 <i>Not real gangs, More like those cheesy</i> <i>gangs you see in Broadway musicals,</i>
###308 <i>Surgical medical surgical yeah!</i>
###311 <i>Still I knew there was</i> <i>one surgical intern I could count on,</i>
###319 <i>If you have some moles</i> <i>I will inspect them</i>
###322 <i>I'll remove tumours from</i> <i>your brain to your rectum</i>
###326 <i>Between the two of us</i> <i>there is no wall</i>
###330 <i>We're a surgeon and a doc</i>
###332 <i>Above it all</i>
###338 <i>A surgeon and a doc</i>
###340 <i>Above it</i>
###344 <i>All</i>
###347 No problem. Whatever you want me to tell your patient, l'm your guy.
###359 - How are you feeling? - l'm not tired.
###362 Stress tests are supposed to be hard.
###365 lt helps if you visualise running toward something,
###368 - like your girlfriend. - l don't have a girlfriend.
###371 How could you possibly be single?
###374 l don't know. l'm kind of anal and neurotic.
###376 My God. Me too.
###378 - Really? - Please!
###380 l like to keep my pens in order from least to most ink.
###383 That is hot. l guess the truth is that
###387 l don't go out a lot, you know?
###389 l always seem to put my foot in my mouth.
###391 l'd let you put your foot in my mouth.
###394 What?
###396 l said l'd let you put your foot in my mouth.
###399 That's weird.
###401 l know.
###411 Who gets to tell us the symptoms of Ménière's disease?
###421 - Dr Murphy. - Can you use it in a sentence?
###425 Sorry to interrupt you there,
###428 but l gotta ask you a quick question. Now, when you were born, nay,
###432 spawned by the Dark Prince himself,
###434 did he forget to give you a hug before he sent you along your way?
###438 Because you can't just let nurses go on account of feeling insignificant.
###443 And besides, with your money,
###445 you ought to be able to keep a man tucked away in the closet
###448 and bring him out when you want to knock him around.
###453 As you were.
###459 Doug, look away.
###462 l can't.
###467 - What are you serving for dinner? - That's not really my area.
###471 l'd like chicken.
###473 Mr Hoffner, here's your surgical consult.
###476 But he's gonna agree with the medical course l set for you. Now, Dr Turk,
###482 tell Mr Hoffner whether or not you think he should have surgery.
###485 l think he should have surgery.
###487 <i>The important thing</i> <i>is that we're professionals</i>
###490 <i>and we should behave as such</i> <i>in front of the patient,</i>
###497 No! Tell me he did not fire her.
###500 You had to show up Kelso and now another nurse is out of a job.
###505 - l went to confront... - Am l done?
###507 You don't look done.
###509 - You know what your problem is? - l put myself...
###512 Who answers that question? That is your problem.
###515 You think you have the answers to everything,
###518 but end up throwing gas on the fire, and everyone pays the consequences.
###522 That's what l was going to say.
###525 Carla, can l talk to you for a second?
###527 My God, Barbie needs you.
###529 To be continued.
###536 Why hasn't he asked me out? l'm single. l mentioned five movies l want to see.
###540 l drop things so when l pick them up, he can see l'm flexible.
###543 Elliot, these things take time and self-respect.
###547 So we're going to focus on time.
###549 - Nobody likes me when they meet me. - Exactly!
###552 l'm helping.
###554 - We've got all the time in the world. - Right.
###559 - No. - l knew it.
###561 l'm dying. l was exhausted on that treadmill.
###565 l should have said something. But l never do.
###567 Not when it comes to my well-being. And now l'm getting a pig heart.
###572 You're perfect.
###574 You're free to go. Today.
###578 - That seems like good news. - Best news ever.
###586 Dropped my clipboard. l'll just...
###589 Do l need to sign something?
###593 - You were going to back me up. - He's had colitis for ten years.
###598 And no girlfriends. lt's a gassy disease.
###602 - You can't consider it a reoccurrence. - He's high risk for colon cancer.
###607 - Give him frequent colonoscopies. - How frequent?
###610 You're turning this into a competition.
###612 Luckily, it's not up to you. lt's up to Mr Hoffner.
###615 l'm going with surgery.
###617 - You're getting meat for dinner. - l eat chicken.
###620 l'll set it up.
###634 - Say it! - l'm your bitch.
###640 <i>I'm not gonna let Turk beat me,</i>
###642 <i>I'm gonna fight back</i> <i>and you want to know how?</i>
###645 <i>I'm telling,</i>
###646 Dr Cox?
###649 He stole my patient.
###652 And then, and then...
###655 lt's OK, Jumbo.
###657 Now, who's my big boy?
###661 - l am! - You're my big boy!
###663 - You're my big boy. - l'm your big...
###666 Good God, newbie, do you think you're the only one with problems here?
###670 Give me a break. Watch this. Pick a nurse, any nurse.
###673 Laverne, when you get a chance, could you grab a file for me?
###677 - Grab these. - Rough all over.
###679 So don't talk to me, Joanie. Just go talk to your patient.
###683 Go.
###688 - What's up, Benedict? - What?
###690 Benedict Arnold?
###692 - That's the lamest smack talk. - That's not what the redcoats thought.
###697 You went colonial on his ass.
###699 So you're gonna go under the knife just cos he told you to?
###702 - No, l spoke to some other people. - Like who?
###706 All fixed.
###708 - He's a janitor. - Yeah, but he seems confident.
###723 What are you gonna do, take a swing at me?
###725 - Maybe. - Well, if you do, l'd better die.
###731 Because if l don't, l will be coming for you.
###734 Good cake today.
###736 You fired a dear, dear friend of mine. That woman was like family.
###741 - Who? - l'll tell you who.
###747 Coffee Nurse.
###748 When you fired Coffee Nurse, you made this whole thing personal.
###752 No, you made it personal.
###754 You gave me lip yesterday in front of the interns.
###756 You know why l laid off those first two nurses?
###759 Budgetary constraints forced a cut, and those two had negative reports.
###764 And you think l did it to make myself happy.
###769 l wouldn't notice if they all caught on fire.
###772 Then why in God's name did you axe Coffee Nurse?
###776 Because you were being an ass.
###778 You're right, that was personal. My bad.
###783 Golly, l do love moist cake.
###792 Where are you going? You're not off 'til midnight.
###794 lt's my last chance, and Sean's only seen me skanked out.
###798 Does it look like l'm trying too hard?
###800 No. Do you need me to ice up your nipples?
###803 - What would that do? - Go get him, tiger.
###813 Dr Reid, we need help with one of your patients.
###823 l'm just a janitor. l don't know much. But l do know this:
###827 You need surgery.
###829 <i>What?</i>
###841 How's it going?
###844 lt's good. Yeah, it's good.
###847 You have something on your cheek.
###849 Yeah, that's just...
###853 That's poo.
###855 You know what they say, right?
###858 Because everybody poops. l just did.
###861 Earlier. Not this second. But down there, l pooped.
###865 That is so cool that you can just talk about it.
###868 Really?
###870 Yeah, l love to poop.
###873 Dr Dorian, present your patient.
###875 Yes, sir.
###877 The patient presented in DKA,
###880 which is why l've started him on an insulin drip...
###883 Don't bother. l'm gonna go in for surgery.
###887 Me too.
###889 l'm having surgery right now, and loving it.
###892 Let's get you out of your skin.
###895 Bob, could l talk to you for a sec?
###904 Can l let my mind wander, or are we doing something?
###907 l just wanted to say that l'm...
###911 - l'm sorry. - Holy crap.
###914 My bad behaviour is my own doing.
###916 l don't think a nurse should suffer on account of it.
###919 - Then l'll make it right... - Thank you.
###924 ...if you will apologise again so the interns can hear.
###928 Your call, Perry.
###933 Dr Kelso.
###935 l'm sorry. l was wrong.
###944 - Doug, for God's sakes. - l don't care. lt's beautiful, man.
###954 l cannot believe l talked to Sean about poo for ten minutes.
###957 - Relax. Nobody knows. - Hey, Poopie.
###961 At one point, l tried changing the subject to art.
###963 But we went from art to artists to alcohol to coffee,
###968 and that just led right back to poo.
###971 You know the saying, ''No one will love you until you learn to love yourself'?
###976 My mother used to say, ''No one will love you''.
###978 Fake it. Don't let him see what a neurotic mess you are.
###982 You see Turk over there?
###985 He doesn't know l cry sometimes because l'm not sure there's a cat heaven.
###991 lt's hiding the crazy and acting like the most confident girl in the room.
###996 No problem.
###999 <i>I too decided it was time to act</i> <i>confident and face things head-on,</i>
###1005 That was my patient, Turk. l brought you in as my friend.
###1009 You're so competitive, you just take him from me? That sucks.
###1013 - Tough. - Excuse me?
###1015 You're damn right l'm competitive. That's what makes me a good doctor.
###1019 l want to win at everything, every day, and you should too.
###1023 That sounds like a great friendship.
###1026 lf you don't want to play ''Steak'', fine. This has nothing to do with friendship.
###1031 You're angry at yourself because you couldn't get the guy to believe in you.
###1037 He never got the concept of the team.
###1040 l know.
###1042 Have a cookie, man.
###1048 - l win at ''Cookie''? - Yeah.
###1052 - Thanks again, sir. - No matter what the board says,
###1056 l'm not going to let someone like you get away. Not without a fight.
###1062 You think she doesn't see through you? These people know who really cares.
###1066 - You and Jennifer are pretty tight? - Hell, yeah.
###1070 Jenny. Gosh, l'm glad you're back.
###1073 Thanks. My name's Patti.
###1078 Fool.
###1085 Sean?
###1092 Sean, wait.
###1097 - ls that... - No!
###1100 No. This is just muddy water. See?
###1104 - You just tasted muddy water. - l know. That was weird.
###1122 You're like, the best doctor ever.
###1125 - Why didn't you ask me out? - Are you kidding?
###1127 l was laying there, pants-less, with crusties in my nose, and l just...
###1131 - Ask me out this minute. - Yes, ma'am.
###1134 Do you want to go out with me, Elliot?
###1138 Yes.
