###3 EDDIE HUANG: All right, let's go see these hot springs
###7 everybody talks about.
###9 LOUIS HUANG: Well this place used because the Hell Valley.
###12 EDDIE HUANG: Hell Valley?
###14 Why?
###14 LOUIS HUANG: Because of the smell.
###16 EDDIE HUANG: Oh my god.
###18 All right, we just made a quick pit stop at the famous
###22 Taiwanese hot springs, and it smells like
###24 Eva Devine's butthole.
###25 She ate a cum burrito.
###26 That bitch is disgusting.
###27 
###31 Let's go, Dad.
###33 LOUIS HUANG: Whatever.

###83 EDDIE HUANG: The first time I went to Din Tai Fung, I
###85 was 12 years old.
###86 And I'm telling you, this was the single greatest bite of
###89 food I've ever had in my life.
###92 You experience it and you're like, yo, I can't explain it.
###94 There's something in the motherfucking water.
###97 Bagels from New York, burritos from San Francisco--
###100 this is that shit, and it is definitely a
###102 transformative food.
###103 And I can't say that about many things.
###104 
###107 I've been working out a lot.
###109 Do I look like I lost weight?
###109 LOUIS HUANG: No, you look good.
###110 EDDIE HUANG: Yeah, I look like I lost weight.

###115 Whoa, yo, yo, yo, instructions to eat soup dumplings.
###120 Wait, they say to poke a hole though.
###123 That's bullshit.
###124 Hooligans poke holes.
###127 This is wrong.
###127 LOUIS HUANG: To cool off the soup inside the dumpling.
###130 EDDIE HUANG: No, but remember when your friend taught us the
###132 first time we came here?
###133 We put it in the vinegar and just let it sit in the vinegar
###136 to cool by itself.
###137 Then you don't need to poke a hole, right?
###139 LOUIS HUANG: That was my brother-in-law.
###141 EDDIE HUANG: That was your brother-in-law?
###142 LOUIS HUANG: That was my brother-in-law.
###144 EDDIE HUANG: Yo, original Jedi, that guy.
###146 But see, isn't that a better technique than poking holes?
###148 LOUIS HUANG: Why poke a hole?
###149 You don't have to.
###150 EDDIE HUANG: Why poke holes?
###151 There's other things to poke.
###154 Your brother-in-law saved the poking for someone else.
###159 LOUIS HUANG: This needs to be cut.
###160 
###163 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###174 EDDIE HUANG: So the trademark of these soup dumplings is
###176 every single soup dumpling here has 18 folds.
###179 You can see every single distinguished fold,
###181 super hard to do.
###183 And you see how they're perfectly bite-sized?
###185 You go to a shitty place like Joe's Shanghai Soup Dumplings
###188 in New York.
###189 They're like giant, nasty soup dumplings.
###191 Big and flat, like large areolas, like Paula Abdul
###195 saucer nipples.
###196 These are nice little dumplings.
###200 How is it?
###201 LOUIS HUANG: This is awesome.
###202 This is awesome, great idea.
###204 
###211 EDDIE HUANG: I like these better.
###214 So, I got a surprise for you, Dad.
###217 This just came out today.
###218 The cover came out today.
###220 You see?
###220 LOUIS HUANG: Oh really?
###221 EDDIE HUANG: That's you.
###222 LOUIS HUANG: "Fresh Off the Boat"
###223 EDDIE HUANG: Yup.
###224 LOUIS HUANG: "Eddie Huang--
###225 A Memoir."
###228 EDDIE HUANG: You could cry.
###230 You like to cover?
###231 LOUIS HUANG: Yeah, very much, very much.
###233 Show her.
###234 See?
###235 That's the cover of his book.
###237 It's coming out next Chinese New Year, in February.
###242 He's got a million dollar book.
###245 EDDIE HUANG: Million dollar book.
###248 There we go.
###249 LOUIS HUANG: Make sure you buy it, OK?
###250 Amazon.com--
###251 you can buy Eddie Huang's memoir.
###253 EDDIE HUANG: Love it.
###254 This is my hype man.
###256 What other hype man got a perm like this?
###258 This dude's killing this perm.
###260 LOUIS HUANG: I thought I'd dress up for this occasion.
###261 EDDIE HUANG: I know.
###262 Dad, do the [INAUDIBLE].
###263 Go like this, go like this.
###265 Go like this, do the [INAUDIBLE].
###267 No, no, one hand like this-- the mirror--
###268 I'll teach you.
###269 Do the Rico, the [INAUDIBLE]
###270 just like this.
###271 LOUIS HUANG: Next time we do this, I'll wish I
###274 still had my hair.
###275 EDDIE HUANG: You still got plenty of hair.
###277 The Soul Glow is treating you well.
###278 
###284 Ready.
###285 
###288 LOUIS HUANG: It's amazing, I was so disappointed
###290 when he quit law.
###292 Because that was three years' hard work.
###295 I was very proud of him.
###296 When he graduated, he got a job right away.
###299 He passed the bar on the first try.
###302 I was very happy that he's set for his life.
###306 And then six months later, he broke the news.
###309 He said, I quit.
###310 I thought, I don't have to worry about Eddie anymore.
###313 His [INAUDIBLE]
###314 got his career all set.
###319 But I'm glad he made a decision and did what he liked
###323 to do, what he loved to do.
###324 So it's very, very brave, very courageous.
###330 Yeah, I'm proud of him.
###331 EDDIE HUANG: He's about to do some shit.
###333 
###337 All right, one, two, three.
###341 Awesome, good.
###343 LOUIS HUANG: Thank you.
###343 SERVER: Thank you.
###344 LOUIS HUANG: You have a customer now.
###347 Those are the Japs.
###349 EDDIE HUANG: [LAUGHS]
###353 Got em.
###355 All right, ready to go see grandpa?
###356 
###359 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###385 LOUIS HUANG: Basically what we do is respect the god, the
###388 sky, the earth, everything else in between.
###393 Bless all these people here.
###395 They accompany us here today to pay respect--
###399 me and my son, Eddie--
###401 to pay respect to my father.
###403 And they are the working crew, and I wish
###407 everybody give them blessing.
###409 Thank you so much.
###411 Thank you.
###414 The incense, the smoke and everything, is a message.
###419 It's a communication between the sky, the earth, and
###424 everything else in between.

###539 EDDIE HUANG: So the thing is, I only met this
###544 grandfather one time.
###545 But ever since I was a kid, of all the people in my family,
###550 he was definitely my role model.
###553 This was the one man in both of my families on either side
###557 that everyone only had good things to say.
###560 
###573 LOUIS HUANG: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###574 
###577 EDDIE HUANG: Grandpa, this money here is for you.
###581 Don't spend it all in one place.
###583 Don't let anyone jux you.
###586 Got you.
###587 [MUSIC - CLAUDE DEBUSSY, "CLAIR DE LUNE"]
###588 
###598 So we burned him some money to buy Ewings, because they don't
###601 have Ewings here.
###602 But now we're going to burn him some things at the store.
###606 LOUIS HUANG: Mercedes.
###606 EDDIE HUANG: Yeah, of course.
###608 We gotta get the red one, the red whip, cherry red Benz.
###612 LOUIS HUANG: And the iPhone.

###631 grandpa when I was asleep.
###633 And my dad doesn't know, my mom doesn't know, but I'd
###635 always be like, man, I want to be like you.
###637 It's funny like, 21st century, we came and we showed grandpa
###642 the cover of our book on an iPhone.
###644 It's ill, man.
