###0 Hi, I'm Sharon Long,
###1 from Stanford University,
###2 and I'm here today to talk about our recent on the plant side
###5 of the nitrogen-fixing symbiosis, specifically about
###8 genes and cell responses.
###11 By way of review, I'll mention again that the Rhizobium symbiosis
###15 happens in organs called root nodules.
###19 And within these nodules, bacteria are able to fix nitrogen
###23 and provide that to the plant for nutrition.
###26 This is complex developmental process,
###29 it goes through a number of stages,
###30 and you'll see some of those today.
###32 It is species specific, which I've discussed in some of my earlier talks.
###36 And importantly, for today's lecture,
###39 bacterium and plant each respond to signals from the other.
###44 An outline of my talk today is shown here.
###46 At the beginning, I'll give you some introduction,
###48 reviewing some of the dynamics of how bacteria and plants interact.
###52 Then I'd like to talk about some recent work in our lab,
###55 first about infection and about of group of proteins called flotillins,
###60 and also about a Nod Factor receptor from the plant.
###64 Then I'd like to talk about two plant mutants, dnf1 and dnf2,
###68 which we've identified as being defective in late stages of nodulation.
###73 And by describing the genes that we've now cloned from those mutants,
###77 I can share with you some of our ideas on how the symbiosis is working.
###83 So, here I'm showing a review of the basic idea
###87 of signal exchange in the early phases of nodulation.
###91 The plant secretes a flavonoid signal,
###95 this flavonoid acts as a trigger in the bacterium,
###98 and that causes the transcription of genes called nod genes,
###102 which encode enzymes. Those enzymes are able to
###105 synthesize this second signal, the so-called Nod Factor, down here,
###110 sometimes abbreviated as NF in some of the slides to come.
###113 This is a modified chitin fragment,
###117 you can see there's four residues of N-acetylglucosamine.
###121 These are modified at the reducing end with a sulfate,
###126 and at the non-reducing end with both an acetyl and an N-acyl group.
###131 And in one of the slides yet to come,
###134 I'll be talking about the differences between the plant response
###137 to chitin to a true Nod Factor.
###141 So Nod Factors are very powerful,
###143 and this gives you an idea of just how powerful they are.
###146 On the top, we have an alfalfa root, and on this root,
###150 Sinorhizobium meliloti, the symbiont, has established a nodule,
###154 and this is an intact nodule.
###156 It's been cleared, and you can see the deep brown color,
###160 which is from the metals that are in the various cytochromes
###163 and enzymes of the bacteria while they're fixing nitrogen.
###167 Now at the bottom, we see a form that looks very similar,
###171 and yet this has no bacteria in it.
###173 This entire structure on an alfalfa root
###175 was caused just by a small droplet of Nod Factor.
###180 So this one chemical is able to produce an entire organ on the plant.
###187 Here is another one of the characteristic early events
###190 in Rhizobium-legume interactions.
###193 This shows root hairs on the root of a plant, and here on the right,
###200 you can see a normal root hair, which grows straight.
###202 And here you see a root hair that has been provoked
###205 by Rhizobium to grow in a such a way that it tops over
###210 and forms a curl. And here in the crook is where the
###215 bacteria are trapped, and these deformed root hairs
###220 of various kinds are very characteristic of the effect
###224 of the correct Rhizobium on its compatible host.
###229 Now, the bacteria are then able to travel by proliferating
###235 and burrowing their way into the plant cell itself.
###239 And this white arrow shows an infection thread;
###242 this is formed by the plant in response to the bacteria.
###246 Within the infection thread, bacteria are proliferating,
###249 and they are invading through the root hair cell,
###253 and as you'll see, eventually down into further cell layers.
###257 So there's the infection thread, and you'll see more about that in a little while.
###262 I'd now like to show you something about the dynamics
###264 of how Rhizobium affect plants.
###267 Let's start by looking at normal root hairs.
###269 So, on a root, the youngest part of the root is over here,
###272 and you can see that they don't have any root hairs yet,
###275 and then the root hairs get longer.
###277 And over here, they're full sized.
###280 So, root hairs get to a particular size, and then they stop.
###283 Now let's watch in this movie,
###285 to see how root hairs elongate normally, that's without Rhizobium.
###290 So here you see root hairs.
###292 They start, they grow, and then at some point
###295 they reach a mature length, and they just stop,
###298 but they grow fairly straight during this entire process.
###302 Now we're going to look at root hairs on a plant that
###305 has been treated with its Rhizobium symbiont.
###309 So here, the root hairs are in the process of growing,
###312 and if you watch what happens to them as they grow,
###316 you'll see how different it is from unperturbed growth.
###322 So here, for example, we see root hairs that are curling.
###328 Over on this side, if you look at this root hair, you can see that it's growing,
###333 and then it pauses, see that pause?
###335 And then it emerges, and now it pauses and branches again.
###339 So there's two things going on.
###341 One is this characteristic pause, so right here you can see
###346 there's a pause right before it starts to top over.
###349 And the other is that you're getting branching or curling,
###353 other kinds of deformation.
###355 So Rhizobium has a profound effect on the morphogenesis
###358 of this particular plant cell.
###361 Now, we've seen a little bit now about root hair deformation,
###365 and I'll mention along the way that Rhizobium can also
###369 cause roots to engage in specific transcription,
###373 which we study with microarrays,
###374 and they provoke cell division.
###377 But for the moment, I just want to look a little bit more
###379 about what happens to these root hairs,
###382 because if you think about it, root hairs are on the surface of the plant,
###386 they're single cells, they have a high surface-to-volume ratio...
###390 it makes sense that these are going to be
###392 exposed to the signals from the outside,
###394 and they might be the place where signal transduction begins.
###398 So, we might ask, by cell biology and by genetics,
###403 are there receptors, and what is the signal transduction pathway?
###407 And ask whether we can study root hairs
###409 as a way of capturing those.
###411 Now, signal transduction is often a complex and fairly rapid
###416 multiprotein process, so we set out to look for events
###420 that occur in root hairs that are cell autonomous and fairly rapid.
###426 One of the earliest studies that we did in this area was
###430 simply to look at the electrochemical potential across the plant membrane.
###435 So in this, we're taking a single root hair here,
###440 and by putting in a microelectrode and measuring the difference
###443 in potential between the interior of the cell and exterior of the cell,
###446 we were able to find that untreated root hairs have a stable,
###451 very negative potential at about -130 to -140 mV.
###457 However, if we treated a root hair with Rhizobium,
###460 what we found was that the Rhizobium and its Nod Factor
###465 are able to cause a depolarization of that plasma membrane,
###469 so that the potential change across the membrane here diminishes.
###475 And that happens actually within a minute.
###478 In our studies and others', this has been shown to be accompanied
###481 by ion fluxes (ion currents) near the tip.
###485 Now one ion in particular is very interesting to us,
###488 and that is calcium. We've used different techniques,
###491 but here's one of them that we have used.
###493 On the left, you can see a root hair,
###497 and into this root hair we're delivering a mixture of
###499 two different fluorescent proteins.
###501 One is fluorescent irrespective of the calcium concentration,
###505 the other increases its fluorescence when calcium is high.
###508 Using those two together, we can take a ratio
###511 and get the value of calcium corrected
###514 for the concentration of the cytoplasm.
###517 And then we can track that over time.
###519 So now we're going to follow calcium in this slide.
###522 Now, this is a pseudo-color representation
###525 of the fluorescence corrected for cytoplasmic concentration.
###530 Cool colors mean low calcium, warm colors mean high calcium.
###535 If you take a look at the root hairs here, they're all blue,
###539 that means low calcium.
###540 As you move in time, and these are ten second intervals,
###544 you see the warmer color, yellow, appearing from the tip of the root hair,
###549 so calcium is getting high at the tip.
###552 As you continue the time series up here,
###555 you can now get to a point where you see this extremely high calcium,
###559 shown by red, and this happens to be in the part of the
###563 cell represented by the nucleus.
###566 So, what can we say, and I'll quantify that with the following graphs.
###571 First, if you compare an untreated cell, that's here,
###574 and here's the baseline of the calcium, with the presentation of
###578 one nanomolar of Nod Factor,
###580 what you find is that about ten minutes after the presentation
###584 of the Nod Factor, you get these sharp upswings in calcium.
###589 And that's what's going on here.
###591 This is the calcium spiking represented there.
###595 Now, number two, if you put in a higher amount of Nod Factor,
###600 10 nanomolar, now you get something more complex.
###606 You get a faster response, and this turns out to be the
###610 tip flux of calcium coming in, and then calcium spiking
###615 happens at the same time.
###618 Now the other data that I'll show you here is that,
###621 if you take chitin alone...
###625 Now remember I pointed out that Nod Factor is like an
###628 oligomer of chitin N-acetylglucosamine resides,
###632 with some modifications. But what if you take the modifications off?
###636 It's not Nod Factor anymore, it's just chitin.
###638 If you add very, very large amounts of chitin,
###646 we've got one micromolar here, so a thousand-fold higher,
###650 you get some spiking, but you need much more chitin than Nod Factor,
###656 and it's not completely normal.
###658 So for that, we can say that the plant is
###662 exquisitely tuned to the Nod Factor.
###665 Finally, we do know that the calcium flux and calcium spiking
###670 are not just separated in space, but they're really independent
###677 in that you can add high Nod Factor after calcium spiking
###683 has started, and you'll get the big influx.
###686 So they really do appear to be two separate events.
###691 Now a third response that we were able to document
###694 very early in nodulation is this one:
###697 Using a whole seedling assay and with an indicator
###702 that shows the presence of hydrogen peroxide,
###705 we can follow normal roots over time,
###709 and we can assess how much peroxide are they producing.
###712 And in a normal, untreated root hair, that's shown here.
###716 They don't produce zero, they produce a modest amount,
###719 and here's what it looks like over a period of about 1.5 hours.
###723 Now what if we treat those with Nod Factor?
###725 What we find, very intriguingly, is that Nod Factor causes
###730 the rate of evolution to be diminished.
###733 So a lower level of hydrogen peroxide is produced
###738 in the presence of Nod Factor.
###742 Now what if we add an "elicitor," pathogenic elicitor?
###746 We would expect an elicitor to cause the plant to
###749 mount a defense response, and sure enough,
###751 if you look at the amount of hydrogen peroxide coming in the plant
###755 after the treatment with the elicitor, it's accelerated.
###759 So it seems that roots are able to elaborate hydrogen peroxide,
###765 an example of reactive oxygen species,
###769 that Nod Factor diminishes that,
###771 which would suggest it's lowering its defenses,
###774 and an elicitor increases it, consistent with an increase in defenses.
###779 Now, this is only over the couple of hours,
###782 we're interested here only in very early events.
###786 In fact, the defense reactions appear to have a very interesting
###791 and complex role later on in nodulation, but this is not related to those.
###797 This is just in the first two hours or so.
###800 So now we can fill in a bit what we know
###802 about the early responses of the plants to the rhizobial Nod Factor.
###808 We know that it causes nodules to form, cell divisions in the plant.
###816 We now can fill in that, in addition to the overall root hair curling,
###821 which we could see in the microscope,
###824 other kinds of assays demonstrate that there's a rapid depolarization
###828 across the plant plasma membrane in response to Nod Factor.
###832 This is accompanied by calcium flux.
###835 Slightly later there's calcium spiking in the cytoplasm and
###838 a suppression of the rate of reactive oxygen production.
###843 Now one other topic that I'll just mention briefly is transcription.
###848 We've been able to assess transcription during nodulation,
###853 at various stages, with a specialized approach,
###858 which is shown on the next slide.
###861 We, following our work on determining the complete genome
###866 sequence of the bacterium, we then constructed an Affymetrix chip
###872 in which we had the complete bacterial genome,
###874 plus about 10,000 sequences representing probable genes
###880 from EST libraries in the plant, and we put
###883 the two genomes on the same Affymetrix chip.
###887 So we call this our SymbioChip, and through analysis of RNA
###894 species from the nodules, we can actually get a readout of
###897 both bacteria and the plant at the same time.
###900 And through that, we were able to show that,
###904 within the first 24 hours after treatment with Nod Factor or
###909 after treatment with bacteria, a characteristic set of plant genes
###915 are upregulated or are downregulated.
###918 Some four dozen or so sequences,
###921 and I'll talk a little bit more about that in a moment when
###924 I get to the mutant analysis.
###926 But now, let me put all of those events on a timeline for you.
###930 So I'm going to start here on the left.
###932 Now, we know that in the very early stages, within a minute,
###936 we get calcium flux, suppression of reactive oxygen,
###941 we get a depolarization.
###943 There's also calcium spiking at about 10 minutes.
###946 There are morphological changes.
###948 You saw in the film that the root hairs pause
###951 and swell a little bit right before they start to curl.
###955 Then there's morphogenesis of the root hair,
###957 forming branches and curls and both.
###961 And we can see the cell divisions. Finally, the transcription.
###965 Now here's the timeline for that happening.
###968 If we start at time zero, and this is where the bacteria are being added,
###972 those first events, such as the calcium flux and the depolarization,
###978 happen within a few minutes, one to a few minutes.
###981 Calcium spiking at an average of 10 minutes.
###984 The gene expression that I mentioned, that we can assess
###986 with our Affymetrix chip, that's happening as early as a
###990 few hours and goes on for about 24 hours.
###993 Now the actual curling of the root hair, the deformation of the root hair,
###997 takes a while to express.
###1000 Of course we have to keep in mind that this is limited by how
###1004 fast the root hair can grow.
###1006 We don't know when the decision to curl is made,
###1009 but the actual outcome, the mechanics of curling,
###1012 take somewhat longer.
###1014 And then, here around 20 hours,
###1016 we're going to start to get infection.
###1018 The production of the infection thread and the ability of the bacteria
###1022 now to penetrate in through that root hair.
###1025 And then the cell division here leading
###1028 to the production of the nodule, that's all happening over this
###1033 period of a day to two days.
###1036 Now through a set of genetic mutageneses and screens,
###1041 our group and others have identified many different plant mutants
###1045 that arrest at one or the other of these stages.
###1050 And having these subcellular assays to do
###1053 allowed us to distinguish between the different kinds of
###1057 plant Nod- mutants. So here's an example.
###1061 Here, on the left, is a gene called
###1066 NFP for "Nod Factor perception." If that gene is mutated,
###1070 you have a block right here, so nothing happens at all,
###1074 there's no depolarization, there's no calcium flux,
###1078 no change in the morphology.
###1080 And then, here are two mutants that are
###1086 present in such a way that they allow the plant to have calcium flux,
###1090 and it has suppression of reactive oxygen species and so forth.
###1095 However, it doesn't show calcium spiking.
###1098 So these two mutants were able to distinguish
###1100 between the early calcium flux and the calcium spiking itself.
###1105 They are not only separated in the cell in geography and in time,
###1109 but they can be separated genetically.
###1113 Here, we found one or more mutants that allow calcium spiking
###1119 but do not allow any gene expression.
###1122 And so forth and so on down the line.
###1125 So with all of this, we are able to set a timeline
###1129 and a developmental sequence for how signals are transduced.
###1133 And among other things, we were able to use that transcription assay
###1138 to distinguish between root hair curling genes
###1143 and early calcium transduction genes.
###1146 And we were able to show that all of those plant genes
###1150 that are expressed come on at the same time.
###1154 It's not the case that you can get a few genes here,
###1158 and a few more here, and a few more after that.
###1160 You get no genes expressed at all, up until this point here.
###1165 And we were able to show that by a combination of
###1167 mutant analysis and transcription analysis.
###1173 So that means we're going to be able to say that
###1176 the series of events of shown here --
###1179 calcium flux, suppression, growth arrest (the pausing) --
###1184 can cluster, and we can see that one particular gene called NFP,
###1190 which we believe encodes a receptor,
###1192 is responsible and required for those events.
###1195 Then there's a set of two genes, DMI1 and DMI2,
###1200 that are required in order to get to calcium spiking.
###1203 One of these is an ion channel,
###1205 the other is a putative receptor kinase.
###1208 Intriguingly, just downstream from calcium spiking
###1213 is a mutant, DMI3, and another mutant, CYCLOPS;
###1217 these are both required in order
###1220 for any of the later events to occur, such as transcription.
###1225 So we believe that these genes help interpret the
###1228 calcium spiking signal and transduce it to the
###1232 next set of genes, NSP1 and NSP2.
###1235 These are required for transcription, and indeed,
###1238 they turn out by sequence to be predicted transcription factors.
###1242 More transcription factors are also required in order for
###1245 nodulation to occur. Now all of these events
###1248 on the right require the one pathway, this is called the signaling pathway,
###1254 starting with the signaling receptor NFP1,
###1257 and going through transcription factors.
###1259 But I haven't said anything about infection,
###1262 and I'd like to mention that.
###1265 It turns out that the plants appear to have not one receptor, but two.
###1270 The second receptor is called the "stringent" or "entry" receptor,
###1275 and the name of that gene is LYK3, in the case of Medicago truncatula.
###1280 This, and one of the transcription factors,
###1283 are required in order for infection to occur.
###1286 So you can have these other events happening, but no infection.
###1292 This additional set of factors is required for infection.
###1298 So back to the outline.
###1300 I've gone through a description of some of the plant cell
###1303 responses to Nod Factor, and told you about
###1305 how we have used plant mutants, plus those cell phenotypes,
###1309 in order to create an ordered set of steps that we believe
###1313 represents the signal transduction pathway in early nodulation.
###1317 In the next part of the talk, I'm now going to move, as I say,
###1322 beyond nodulation: I'll be talking about infection
###1325 and also about later stages in nodulation.
###1330 So, as we think about the symbiosis, remember,
###1334 everything that I described in terms of early signal transduction
###1338 is over here. That's just the beginning.
###1342 There's so much more to come.
###1344 There's as the bacteria infect and eventually form the nodule.
###1350 So now let's take a look at some of the
###1352 specific topics that are interesting. First, infection.
###1356 We've already seen that more genes are needed
###1358 for infection than just for signaling.
###1361 And the infection thread is a remarkable structure.
###1364 It penetrates not just through the root hair,
###1367 but then through multiple layers of plant cells,
###1371 on its way in to find target cells.
###1376 Now, as this proceeds, the plant elaborates an entire nodule,
###1382 and all the dark cells in this photo are packed full of bacteria.
###1388 And if you look close up at those,
###1390 each bacterium is surrounded by an envelope of plant membrane,
###1395 and within that, the bacteria are going to differentiate.
###1399 So, using different approaches,
###1401 we're going to take a look at how the plant manages
###1405 to support these really remarkable events.
###1408 We'll start with infection. As I mentioned,
###1413 infection occurs beginning in the root hairs,
###1416 and what we wanted to ask is,
###1418 how does the inside of the plant cell
###1420 cope with the invasion of the bacterium?
###1422 How does it reorganize itself?
###1424 We decided to take a look at some candidate genes called flotillins.
###1430 These are genes that are originally identified in animals.
###1434 I'll give a brief review, and then I'll show you
###1437 our data that demonstrate that plant flotillins are active in nodulation.
###1443 There's two copies of flotillins that are specifically upregulated
###1447 in nodules, their transcription is regulated along with other
###1453 nodulation genes, they're required for infection,
###1458 they're required for elongation, and remarkably,
###1461 the proteins of these flotillins have very striking
###1465 localizations that we believe relate to the
###1468 mechanism of infection. So, what are flotillins?
###1471 They've been studied widely in animal cells.
###1474 This diagram shows an animal cell with plasma membrane.
###1478 Flotillins are shown here. There's two of them, they're outlined in red.
###1484 They have a domain that is affiliated with the membrane,
###1487 and a tail that is more cytoplasmic.
###1490 And it is thought that they relate to signaling, to endocytosis,
###1496 and to activity of the actin network within the cell.
###1503 It's also been demonstrated that these flotillins occur
###1510 in what are sometimes termed "membrane microdomains,"
###1514 also sometimes called lipid rafts,
###1516 although the terminologies are actively being discussed these days.
###1524 Now plants have flotillins, too,
###1525 although they have not been widely studied.
###1529 In Arabidopsis, the sequence shows that
###1531 there are three flotillins. In our analysis,
###1533 we found more than seven in the legume Medicago truncatula.
###1541 Of these seven, we found that two are uniquely expressed in nodules.
###1547 We found that the proteins are, as with animals,
###1550 flotillins present in small domains, or puncta.
###1555 And I'll show you that one of the two has a very special localization
###1561 during infection.
###1562 Now, the predicted structures of the flotillins in plants
###1566 looks very much like the animals',
###1567 with a head domain and a tail domain,
###1571 so we might expect that it's going to have some of the same properties.
###1576 So, as I mentioned, Arabidopsis has only three flotillins,
###1580 but Medicago truncatula has more than seven,
###1584 and here's one of the really interesting things for us,
###1587 is that there are a great number of these that are actually
###1591 all linked together.
###1592 Now you'll see here that there's flotillin 3 and 1,
###1595 then there's down here flotillin 4 and flotillin 2.
###1599 We believe that those are active flotillins.
###1602 One of the others, shown here flotillin 5,
###1604 is in the same genomic regiion, but we believe it's not an active gene.
###1611 Now, we took a look at the activity of the promoters
###1615 for each of those flotillins, and what you can see here is
###1618 that the top, flotillin 1, its promoter is active in the vasculature.
###1624 Here it's expressing a GUS fusion.
###1628 Flotillin 3 is also active in the vasculature.
###1632 But if you take a look at flotillin 2 and flotillin 4,
###1635 these are being expressed in nodules.
###1639 We can also quantify the transcript, and the same story emerges.
###1643 We can see here that flotillin 1 and 3
###1646 are at a low level throughout nodulation,
###1649 but both flotillin 2 and flotillin 4 are strongly upregulated
###1654 in the first day after roots are presented with bacteria.
###1660 Flotillin 4 comes down, although flotillin 2 stays fairly well expressed
###1667 during at least a couple of weeks of nodulation.
###1671 So in terms of their expression,
###1674 these appear to be especially associated with nodule development.
###1679 Does that relate to any of the formalities that we know
###1683 right now about the genetics of early nodulation?
###1687 So remember that there are a set of genes that I introduced earlier,
###1690 and we have mutations in these various
###1693 steps for nodule signal transduction,
###1698 and that transcription occurs only after a whole set of steps
###1704 have taken place. So what about flotillin 2 and 4?
###1708 And as you can see in this bar graph,
###1712 those two flotillins actually require the same signal transduction pathway
###1716 in order to be expressed.
###1718 Here is a wild type on the left, we're seeing flotillin 2 and 4.
###1722 And then here are a couple of the nodulation mutants.
###1727 LYK3, NSP2, NIN-1, those are here.
###1732 NSP and NIN, here's LYK3 for a receptor for Nod Factor.
###1738 These appear to be required in order for the flotillins to be upregulated.
###1743 We could also show that some of the downstream genes
###1746 are not required.
###1748 Now, we know that these flotillins are controlled
###1752 in the same way nodulation genes are controlled,
###1755 but what about their function?
###1758 Through using RNAi approaches, we can diminish the
###1762 activity of the various flotillins, and here's one particular experiment,
###1768 and these results have been borne out in others',
###1771 though the absolute numbers tend to vary.
###1775 So if we take a look at a wild-type plant for example,
###1778 we can see that it's got about six nodules per plant.
###1782 If you knock out flotillin 1 and 3, there's again about six.
###1786 But if you knock out flotillin 2, there's many fewer nodules.
###1792 Flotillin 2 and flotillin 4, if knocked out together, is even more.
###1796 But flotillin 4 knocked out by itself
###1798 does not appear to have much an effect on the number of nodules.
###1803 If you look at the percent of plants with nodules,
###1806 you don't see a major effect.
###1807 In fact, if anything, you seem to get a few increases
###1812 of the percentage of plants that have some kind of growth on them.
###1816 But now if we look at the percentage of nodules
###1820 that are actually Fix+, which is indicated by the pink color
###1824 from leghemoglobin, you can see that about,
###1829 in this particular experiment, almost 30% of the wild-type nodules
###1834 appear to be functioning, about the same for flotillin 1 and 3 knockouts.
###1840 But if flotillin 2 is knocked out,
###1843 then there's a striking diminution of the number of functional nodules,
###1848 and a less striking but still significant change for flotillin 4.
###1854 And the double mutant almost completely wipes out
###1858 any effectiveness of the nodules that do form.
###1861 So, we would conclude from that that flotillin 2 and flotillin 4
###1865 are both required for nodulation, and that they are not redundant,
###1869 because the double mutant has a more severe phenotype
###1872 than either of the single mutants alone.
###1876 We've also now gone to take a look at the proteins,
###1878 and what we found is the following:
###1881 Let's begin on the left with flotillin 2.
###1884 This is a view of epidermal cells,
###1886 so we're looking down at the surface of the root here.
###1889 And you can see that flotillin 2 is present in little dots, or puncta,
###1894 and there's a very striking localization of flotillin 2
###1898 at the polar end of the cell.
###1903 In the root hairs, the flotillin 2 is very strikingly punctate,
###1907 it's present in these little dots, and this kind of distribution
###1915 remains the case if the plants are inoculated,
###1920 and that's shown in the lower part of the left-hand side.
###1923 So, uninoculated and inoculated, flotillin 2 is punctate,
###1928 it remains fairly stable, although there are some subtle changes
###1933 in density and in polarity.
###1936 But we got a very striking result with flotillin 4,
###1941 and I'll show you that here. Now let's start on the top again.
###1943 The epidermal cells and root hair cells,
###1946 and it's very striking that the flotillin 4 signal (a GFP fusion signal)
###1952 is present in puncta. But even more striking was that,
###1957 after inoculation, what starts out as an even distribution of flotillin 4
###1962 in root hairs becomes a highly polar distribution,
###1966 and that's shown with these red arrows,
###1969 where you can see that at the tips of these inoculated,
###1972 bacteria-treated root hairs, flotillin 4 has migrated to the tip.
###1978 So, that suggests that flotillin 4 has a very active participation
###1984 in something having to do with what goes on at root hair tips.
###1987 So we began to look specifically at infection,
###1990 using wild type as control, where you can see bacteria invading.
###1996 These blue, lac-stained bacteria show infection threads
###1999 for bacteria on a wild-type plant.
###2004 Here's a nice infection thread growing through a root hair
###2006 on the wild type. But in a flotillin 4 "minus" mutant,
###2009 things are not working very well.
###2012 What you're seeing here is that there's no significant
###2016 penetration deep into the nodule.
###2019 Furthermore, even if you look at a root hair,
###2022 the infection threads lack integrity, they're not well structured,
###2029 and we find in fact that they don't succeed, they don't penetrate.
###2034 So it appears that flotillin 4 function is important for infection threads,
###2039 and we also now have evidence that shows that flotillin 4 is
###2042 associated with infection threads.
###2046 Flotillin 2 is shown here, bright green fluorescence around the cell.
###2053 This particular root hair, which is curled, has been infected,
###2056 and it has bacteria that fluoresce red. Those bacteria are shown here.
###2061 But you can see that the flotillin 2 is around the membrane of the outer cell,
###2066 it's not affected, not close by to the red fluorescence of the bacteria.
###2071 However, if we look at flotillin 4, that's shown here.
###2075 Flotillin 4-GFP is around the outside, but it's also here, see?
###2080 Around the infection thread. Green fluorescence,
###2084 and here's the red bacteria inside the fluorescence.
###2087 So that suggests that flotillin 4 is affiliated with the
###2091 infection thread membrane.
###2093 Now you'll recall that, in the sequence of genes
###2097 that are important for nodulation signal transduction,
###2101 one set is called the signaling pathway, here,
###2104 but more genes are needed in order to get infection,
###2107 including the entry receptor LYK3.
###2110 Now that we've got some clue that flotillins are involved in infection,
###2114 we might want to ask whether we can place flotillins in any kind of
###2118 relationship to the genes that have been previously found
###2121 to be important for early signaling and infection.
###2124 Now, in the following photos,
###2127 I'm looking at the puncta density of flotillin 4.
###2133 Here's a wild type, and the puncta density is the number of
###2137 bright spots per square micron,
###2140 so you might have a little square micron there,
###2145 and then you plot the number.
###2147 And I'm going to compare that wild type to three different mutants.
###2152 Each of these is a mutant in the putative entry receptor LYK3.
###2156 lyk3-1, which is the most severe,
###2160 and two other alleles, lyk3-2 and 3-4.
###2166 The lyk3-1 is predicted to have a protein with a dead kinase domain,
###2173 and what we saw looking at this particular index of
###2177 puncta density is that, if you compare the wild-type number here
###2182 to the number in the lyk3-1 mutant, the puncta density for FLOT4
###2187 is greatly diminished, significantly lower.
###2190 We don't draw any mechanistic conclusion from this,
###2193 but it did give us the sense that maybe LYK3 itself,
###2197 together with FLOT4, would be worth looking at.
###2201 So we want to ask whether LYK3 and flotillin 4 interact.
###2206 We're going to need to study LYK3,
###2208 and we were fortunate to collaborate with Doug Cook, Brendan Riely,
###2212 and their colleagues at UC Davis, and thanks to their contributions,
###2217 we have the following tools for study:
###2219 First and most importantly, a stable transgenic of
###2223 Medicago truncatula that carries a GFP fusion to LYK3,
###2227 under the control of its own promoter.
###2230 It's known that this is functional because it complements
###2233 a lyk3-1 mutant.
###2235 Because it's under its own promoter, we have more reassurance
###2239 about its correct position and localization.
###2242 Now into this stable transgenic, we're now going to introduce
###2247 a second marker, we're going to create a transformant
###2251 that also has flotillin 4 linked to the fluorescent mCherry protein,
###2257 so we'll have green fluorescence for LYK3, red fluorescence for FLOT4.
###2261 And our particular tool is going to be a spinning-disk confocal
###2264 at the Carnegie Institution, in collaboration with David Ehrhardt.
###2270 We were able to visualize the LYK3 putative receptor in root hairs.
###2277 So the results are shown here.
###2279 We have LYK3-GFP, it's present in the root hair,
###2282 you can see that it's punctate.
###2287 And when we took a look at the LYK3 plant with infections,
###2292 we found the following: Here's a curled root hair,
###2296 and you can see going down through the curled root hair
###2298 is an infection thread, and the green fluorescence of
###2301 that LYK3 is all the way along the infection thread membrane,
###2305 so we can see that the LYK3 putative receptor is localizing
###2310 the same way that the flotillin 4 appears to do along the
###2315 infection thread, as it moves into the cell.
###2318 Now, an important control is shown here also.
###2321 Root hairs and other parts of plant cell walls have
###2326 autofluorescence as well, and we wanted to ask whether
###2330 the green fluorescence we saw here was really due to the LYK3,
###2334 or was it autofluorescence.
###2336 The results of that are shown in this other panel.
###2339 Now, this is a fusion of LYK3 to a nonfluorescent protein.
###2345 And again, there are bacteria that are fluorescing red.
###2348 Well, what you can see is that it's a good idea
###2351 to do this control because the crook of the root hair
###2355 is very highly autofluorescent, so if we were to see this
###2359 and say it's GFP fluorescence, we'd be wrong,
###2362 because that's just what root hair cell wall is doing.
###2365 You can see here the infection thread is moving down
###2369 with the red fluorescence, and there is no
###2374 green fluorescence around it.
###2375 So infection threads are not intrinsically fluorescent;
###2379 it's only that the LYK3-GFP is providing that signal.
###2384 So now we know that flotillin 4 and LYK3 appear
###2388 to localize to the same place.
###2390 Can we find out anything else about them?
###2393 So in this, we have started to use that double transgenic.
###2401 So what's going on here is that this plant has LYK3-GFP.
###2406 It also has flotillin 4-mCherry.
###2409 Now, these are closeups below, you can see the LYK3-GFP,
###2414 flotillin 4-mCherry.
###2416 And these are uninfected root hairs.
###2419 And if you merge the two images,
###2421 it's possible to see here that the green and red are distinct.
###2426 So that suggests that they are not co-localizing
###2429 within the distance where their fluorescence would
###2432 mix and make a yellow color.
###2435 Now, taking a look at that more statistically,
###2438 we can do a correlation plot, as shown here,
###2441 where on one axis, on the x-axis, that's the fluorescence intensity of one,
###2447 on the y-axis is the fluorescence intensity of the other.
###2451 And in fact, there's a distribution all the way around,
###2455 it doesn't particularly correlate.
###2457 If you have a high fluorescence of mCherry,
###2459 that could be either low or high fluorescence of GFP.
###2464 But what happens when we treat root hairs with bacteria?
###2470 And that's shown here.
###2472 Now, again we've got the GFP, here's a closeup.
###2476 We've got the mCherry for the flotillins, and a closeup.
###2480 But now, when we do the co-localization,
###2482 you can see that there appears to be a
###2485 merging of the green and red fluorescence,
###2488 to present a higher number of puncta that look yellow.
###2493 So we would say there appears to be an increase
###2497 in the correlation of their location,
###2501 and here's another way of looking at that.
###2503 The correlation plot now shows a correlation coefficient
###2508 that's more than 0.5.
###2512 That means that more than half the time,
###2515 you're getting a correlation of the intensity of fluorescence
###2518 of one and the other.
###2520 So that suggests to us that whether or not flotillin 4 and LKY3
###2525 are associated depends on
###2528 whether the bacteria have interacted with the root hair.
###2531 So we pursued that a little more.
###2534 Another way that we have started to look at that
###2536 is to examine the dynamics, not just the location,
###2540 but dynamics of what these proteins are doing.
###2543 So in this experiment, we're going to be looking at a root hair
###2548 which has a LYK3-GFP fusion, so that's the only fluorescence
###2553 you're going to see, it's just the receptor LYK3.
###2557 And what you're going to be seeing in the micrographs
###2560 is as if you took a plane like this, right?
###2564 Through the root hair and, where you see this bright point,
###2569 that's what is going to be shown now on the films.
###2574 Now the left-hand...
###2576 we're going to look at LYK3 in an uninfected root hair.
###2581 So one of the things you can see is that it's very dynamic.
###2585 If you try to focus on a point and follow the LYK3,
###2590 it's moving around too much, you can't do that.
###2593 But now let's look at a root hair that has been treated with bacteria.
###2599 What a difference.
###2600 Now you're looking at the LYK3 fluorescence,
###2602 and it's really behaving itself. It's sort of staying place,
###2605 and these two arrowheads, for example,
###2607 show places that you can focus in,
###2609 and you can see a LYK3 signal that's not moving, that's fairly stable.
###2614 So that suggests to us that it's not just where LYK3 is,
###2620 it's how fast it's moving and perhaps shuttling around,
###2625 that is being changed by the presence of the bacteria,
###2627 which is remarkable, and that led us to another way
###2632 to look at LYK3 together with flotillin 4.
###2636 In the following, we won't be looking at movies,
###2639 but we'll be representing the dynamics over time
###2641 through what's called a kymograph.
###2643 Now what you're seeing on the left is a micrograph of the receptor
###2649 LYK3-GFP fluorescence, flotillin 4 fluorescence, and the merge.
###2654 Likewise, here for bacterially treated root hairs,
###2659 LYK3-GFP, flotillin 4-mCherry, and then the merge.
###2664 Now, at each point in time, we don't look at the whole root hair,
###2670 we're going to just be looking at a transect shown here,
###2674 and also shown over here, by these blue arrows.
###2678 And at any one point in time, just that line is going to
###2682 be represented as follows.
###2685 Here, if we take this line going across the uninfected LYK3-GFP,
###2694 then we can see at one 10-second period
###2698 whether a particular position was light or dark.
###2701 We can follow that over time and we can see that the correlation
###2705 is rather loose. However, flotillin 4 is very stable;
###2709 if you look at the flotillin 4,
###2712 10 seconds, 20 seconds, and so forth...
###2715 if it's fluorescent at one 10-second interval,
###2718 it's highly likely to be fluorescent in the next one,
###2720 and so you get this set of lines going through.
###2724 Now, if we take a look at root hairs that are treated with bacteria,
###2728 we find the following.
###2731 Again, this is what the root hairs look like,
###2736 but if we follow them over time, you can now see that the LYK3-GFP
###2739 is very stable. If that transect shows a bright point
###2744 at one 10-second interval, it's probably going to be bright
###2746 the next 10-second interval as well, so the LYK3 has settled down,
###2752 the flotillin 4 is still very stable, and when you take a look at the merge,
###2757 you can see that there appears to be a correlation of the brightness.
###2762 So, as we summarize, we can say the following:
###2766 That the puncta density is changed for FLOT4-GFP
###2774 in a genetic background where LYK3 is mutated.
###2778 We can see that LYK3 itself localizes in puncta
###2783 that suggests it's in membrane microdomains.
###2786 Also, it also localizes to infection threads.
###2789 We found that in uninfected root hairs, the receptor
###2795 and the flotillin do not have much overlap,
###2799 and also they are very different in their motility, in their dynamics.
###2803 However, after inoculation with Sinorhizobium meliloti,
###2808 the receptor and the flotillin co-localize,
###2811 and their dynamics remain similar.
###2814 Not known is whether this is direct or indirect.
###2818 What is the nature of the protein-protein interactions?
###2820 Because fluorescence in and of itself is relatively loose,
###2826 it does not have to have precise molecular adjacency.
###2831 So further fluorescence studies with FRET
###2836 and biochemical studies will be necessary,
###2838 and we think that following the combination of
###2842 flotillins and receptors is going to be a very exciting way
###2846 to ask how the plant is mobilizing itself to accept infection.
###2851 So back to the outline.
###2853 I've finished talking a little bit about how a candidate gene approach
###2858 took us from the study of flotillins to the study of infection.
###2862 In this next segment, I'd like to talk about some mutants
###2866 that we've isolated called the dnf mutants.
###2869 These have identified plants genes
###2872 necessary for the final stages of symbiosis.
###2875 And I'll talk about two of those, DNF1,
###2879 which encodes a signal peptidase,
###2881 and DNF2, a putative phospholipase C.
###2885 So looking again at the sequence of nodulation,
###2887 we're now taking a look at an even later stage,
###2891 where bacteria have penetrated into the nodule,
###2895 and they get released into the cells, and they're able to fix nitrogen.
###2902 So the dnf mutants, called "defective in nitrogen fixation,"
###2907 were isolated out of a screen that we did of
###2910 mutants that we generated by fast neutron bombardment.
###2914 This often creates deletions, it's an ionizing radiation,
###2919 and so these are severe mutants.
###2921 When we screen them, we found a number of mutants
###2925 which were like this. Instead of being nice,
###2928 pink nodules here, the dnf mutants are white,
###2931 and they're small. They don't have any nitrogenase activity,
###2935 and that's shown in this slide
###2938 by assessment of acetylene reduction, shown here.
###2942 Wild type is able to convert acetylene to ethylene,
###2945 which an indicator for nitrogenase enzyme.
###2948 But the dnf mutants, as you can see,
###2950 have very low or even no ability to fix nitrogen.
###2955 Now, they also don't seem to have completely normal development.
###2960 One of the mutants, dnf1, is shown here,
###2962 and we got two alleles of that, they're very similar.
###2965 A wild-type nodule has cells filled with bacteria.
###2971 The bacteria do get infected into the dnf1 nodules as well;
###2976 nonetheless, they are not as large,
###2979 and they do not seem to be able to fix nitrogen.
###2983 So we took a look further at dnf1,
###2987 and one of the ways in which we studied this was as follows.
###2993 Here's a wild-type nodule shown in section, and this nodule,
###2999 in this case, has been established by the action of a bacterium
###3004 carrying a glucuronidase fusion into the promoter
###3008 for the nitrogenase gene. That means that if the bacteria
###3013 are expressing their nitrogenase, then the nodule will turn blue
###3018 in the presence of a glucuronidase substrate.
###3021 So, what we see here is that the nifH (which is nitrogenase)-glucuronidase
###3026 fusion is turned on.
###3028 That's good, that means that the bacteria are expressing their
###3031 nitrogen fixation genes.
###3033 However, what we found with the dnf1 was the following:
###3038 Taking a look at these nodules with the same exact bacterium
###3042 carrying a glucuronidase fusion to the nif promoter, we found no activity.
###3047 You could see here with the red arrow; it's pointing toward the nodule,
###3050 but there's no blue stain.
###3051 So we conclude from this that the bacteria are not able to
###3055 express the genes for nitrogen fixation.
###3059 So we can say that the bacteria need the plant's DNF1
###3063 in order for the bacteria to fix nitrogen,
###3066 or even to express their nitrogen fixation genes.
###3069 So what is dnf1? This gene in the plant encodes
###3074 one of the subunits of what turns out to be a nodule-specific
###3078 signal peptidase.
###3079 And I'll tell you about nodule-specific
###3081 and the other components in a moment.
###3083 But first I'll just review a little bit what signal peptidase is.
###3086 In a eukaryotic cell, we've got the endoplasmic reticulum,
###3091 and proteins that are extruded into the lumen
###3096 may get there by a signal peptide,
###3098 and if the signal peptidase cleaves off that signal peptide,
###3103 and that allows the production of the mature protein,
###3107 which would be shown here.
###3108 Now, once that mature protein is formed,
###3111 after its signal peptide is taken off,
###3114 then it may be targeted for secretion or for vesicle trafficking.
###3120 So what we found is that DNF1,
###3122 required for bacterial gene expression and differentiation,
###3127 has something to do with protein processing.
###3130 Now let's take a look at the expression of this gene.
###3133 If you take a look at the vegetative parts of the plant,
###3135 such as the leaf and stem or flowers,
###3140 what you find is that expression of the DNF1 signal peptidase subunit
###3145 is very low, but it's quite high in nodules.
###3149 It's also present to some extent in developing seeds,
###3152 although at a much lower level.
###3154 Taking a look at the time course, what we can see is here.
###3157 The DNF1, if you plot days of nodule growth and development,
###3163 and DNF1 expression, you can see that DNF1
###3165 goes up early in nodule development.
###3169 You can also track it during seeds and find that
###3172 it's relatively steady during the maturation of seeds.
###3176 So, DNF1 is most highly expressed in nodules
###3179 and it goes up very early in those nodules.
###3182 Now, let's take a look not just at DNF1, but using transcription,
###3189 let's take a look at what genes,
###3192 out of all the microarray data, tend to be expressed
###3195 whenever DNF1 is expressed, and those are shown here.
###3199 Now, on the left, you can see the names of the proteins.
###3204 This is what they do, and what you can see is that there's
###3207 the other subunits in the signal peptidase complex,
###3214 are also regulated up in early nodules the same way the DNF1 is.
###3220 In addition, the signal peptide peptidase,
###3222 which is needed for completion of the degradation of the signal peptide,
###3227 that's also upregulated.
###3229 And finally, this very intriguing protein, SYP132, syntaxin 132...
###3235 Now what are syntaxins?
###3237 This is a reminder of how they have been characterized in animal cells;
###3242 syntaxins are important proteins for vesicle targeting, and in fact,
###3250 SYP132 here in the plant probably marks the last step of protein secretion,
###3256 and empirically, it has been observed on plant plasma membranes
###3260 and also on what's called the symbiosome membrane.
###3264 That's the membrane that surrounds the bacterium once it's inside the cell.
###3268 So if we take a look at all of these genes,
###3271 we can see that they are co-regulated.
###3274 So we've got a whole signal peptidase complex, and what is it doing?
###3278 One of the most important questions that could be asked is,
###3280 what are the substrates?
###3282 What proteins does this signal peptidase help to mature?
###3286 And the answer came from work in the labs
###3289 in Gif-sur-Yvette and in Szeged, Hungary,
###3293 led by Eva Kondorosi and Peter Mergaert, and their colleagues.
###3297 And what they have described is a set of proteins
###3300 called "nodule cysteine-rich peptides."
###3304 These are characteristic of nodules,
###3307 they are not expressed anyplace else in the plant.
###3310 And they are rich in cysteine and bear some resemblance to defensins,
###3314 which are proteins made by plants and animals
###3318 in response to microbes.
###3321 They were able to show using our dnf1 mutant, that one of these,
###3326 for example, NCR peptide #1, in a wild-type plant,
###3331 gets processed to a smaller molecular weight.
###3335 But unless the DNF1 peptidase is there, it does not get processed,
###3340 because here's our mutant, and you can see that the protein,
###3344 shown here in immunoblot, is larger.
###3347 It's because its signal peptide was never taken off.
###3350 They have also been able to show that, with antibodies,
###3354 that in wild-type cells, if you use a green dye to indicate the bacteria
###3359 and a red fluorescence for the antibody to the NCR peptide,
###3365 they co-localize.
###3366 Bacteria and NCR peptides co-localize in a normal wild-type cell.
###3372 Here, they showed an example of what happens in a mutant dnf1 cell.
###3378 You can see that the bacteria are all over the place in green,
###3383 but that this NCR peptide,
###3386 which we know is not being processed, right?
###3388 Because it's large molecular weight?
###3389 That NCR peptide is stuck someplace,
###3392 probably in the endoplasmic reticulum.
###3394 So, their conclusions, together with our work on the DNF1,
###3399 are that the NCR peptides are substrates of the DNF1 complex.
###3403 In wild type, these are delivered to the symbiosome,
###3406 and in dnf1, they're retained in the ER.
###3409 They've shown in other work that these mature NCR peptides
###3413 have profound effects on bacteria,
###3415 such as causing them to cease cell division
###3418 and changing their membrane permeability,
###3421 so that's an ongoing story about the activity of the NCRs.
###3426 To complete the model so far, we might ask,
###3430 what does DNF1 do,
###3432 and one likely activity is that it processes NCR proteins.
###3438 These end up in the lumen of the ER, and they are targeted,
###3442 perhaps using SYP132 as part of the mechanism for targeting,
###3448 into vesicles, which come over and fuse with the symbiosome,
###3453 in which Rhizobium are going to be differentiating.
###3457 Now, we also have questions about DNF1 beyond the NCR proteins.
###3462 For example, DNF1 is present even in legume plants
###3466 that do not have the NCR proteins.
###3469 So what is it doing there?
###3471 Another question is, in the dnf1 mutant,
###3477 the bacteroids do not differentiate, but they also stop dividing,
###3482 so it seems that even without DNF1,
###3485 there may be other signals that are helping these bacteria
###3490 to stop dividing. So we hope that we'll be able to work on those,
###3493 as well as on the actual mechanism of DNF1
###3497 in the next period of our work.
###3500 I'd now like to finish by telling you about the other mutant, dnf2.
###3504 And this, as you recall, as shown right there,
###3507 that also had no nitrogen fixation.
###3511 And we've done some work to characterize
###3514 what's going on with dnf2
###3516 and also to figure out what the gene is.
###3518 Here is a picture in which you can see,
###3521 from the root part to the distal part of the nodule,
###3526 fluorescently labeled bacteria, and they are inside.
###3530 We can tell that the bacteria get inside the dnf2 mutant nodules.
###3536 However, they don't express nitrogenase,
###3540 and they don't express many other bacterial genes either.
###3543 So, somehow, DNF2 is again required for the bacteria
###3548 to differentiate and, in fact, to express genes.
###3553 Now we know that DNF2 is expressed only in nodules,
###3558 even more strictly than DNF1.
###3561 This shows you some promoter-GUS fusions
###3563 where you can see that the early part of the nodule is expressing DNF2,
###3569 and here you can see it at the tip,
###3571 and then it diminishes just slightly as the nodules get somewhat older.
###3578 What is DNF2?
###3581 It appears to be similar to a phospholipase C,
###3586 but it's not a canonical phospholipase C the way we're used to seeing.
###3590 Here would be the classic PLC.
###3593 You can see it's got the inositol trisphosphate binding, EF-hands,
###3599 catalytic domains, calcium-binding domains, and so forth.
###3604 The DNF2 is only homologous to
###3609 one part of this large, complex phospholipase C.
###3615 However, we do find that it is very, very similar
###3619 to a phospholipase C whose model is shown here.
###3623 This is actually a bacterial phospholipase C,
###3627 and if you take this in red and then superpose DNF2,
###3631 it does appear to be very, very similar in its 3D structure.
###3636 So we want to know what's the biochemical activity;
###3639 sequence alone doesn't tell us whether it really acts
###3643 to process phospholipids or as a signaling.
###3650 But we found one other thing that's really surprising to us.
###3654 First, as I mentioned, it's only expressed in nodules,
###3658 but secondly, it's not expressed in the cells of the plant that have Rhizobium.
###3665 It's expressed in the noninfected cells of the nodule.
###3669 And that's really a first.
###3671 There are known metabolic enzymes in soybean, for example,
###3675 that are present in uninfected cells.
###3678 But there has never been found a regulator
###3680 that appears to be active in the noninfected cells of the root nodule.
###3686 So, what we're trying to ask ourselves is,
###3689 does the DNF2 protein mediate the infection process
###3693 directly or indirectly?
###3696 Is it acting in some way that allows the noninfected cells
###3700 to send signals or perhaps to avoid signals?
###3703 So those are some of the questions that lie ahead for us.
###3707 So winding up the combination of the studies that I've shown you today,
###3711 I think that the future of our field is going to be very exciting
###3714 as we take the results of the plant mutants and
###3718 we study the proteins that are defined by those mutations,
###3721 and look at how those work, both plant and bacteria together,
###3725 not looking just at position, but looking at time.
###3728 We're interested in the great questions of:
###3732 What the signals are,
###3734 and how the signals are transduced.
###3736 Given that so much complicated cell biology has to happen
###3740 between the beginning of the infection thread and the maturation of the symbiosome,
###3745 we want to know not just the regulation,
###3747 but what is the machinery of this infection,
###3750 and we believe that both the proteins and molecular probes
###3753 that we can obtain can be used to study the individual steps of
###3758 nodulation as they move forward.
###3761 So that concludes our journey through the plant side of symbiosis.
