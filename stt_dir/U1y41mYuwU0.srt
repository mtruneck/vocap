was like, boom.

0:0:21,12 --> 0:0:22,61
There was another kidnapping,
you know?

with.

-Now, it's hard to picture a
place that's so fucked up that


12
0:0:31,43 --> 0:0:33,58
not that many kidnappings

But in northern Mexico,
everything is relative.


15
0:0:37,54 --> 0:0:41,38
The sobering reality of it is,
in Mexico in 2011 there were

49 kidnappings a day.

-So they're having this rodeo
because a dude lost his leg?

0:0:59,95 --> 0:1:3,41
-Yeah, one of the cowboys lost
his leg and they're doing a

worried about before we

came here was people knowing
that we were here.

out with the LeBarons

drinking for a bit with Brent,


62
0:2:49,11 --> 0:2:51,49
he suggested we go on a
ride-along on the nightly


63
0:2:51,49 --> 0:2:55,325
patrol of the LeBaron colony.


64
0:2:55,325 --> 0:2:58,48

truck with a CB and a couple


65
0:2:58,48 --> 0:2:59,94
of good old boys in the back.


66
0:2:59,94 --> 0:3:2,875

heavy, heavy business.

SHANE (OFFSCREEN): What are
we doing right now?


69
0:3:11,49 --> 0:3:15,61
-So we're just going to take on
a routine route that they


70
0:3:15,61 --> 0:3:16,41
normally take.


71
0:3:16,41 --> 0:3:19,845
And then they'll probably do
a security checkpoint for a


72
0:3:19,845 --> 0:3:22,5
little while and maybe
check some

crazy is you're driving

So the federales


84
0:4:3,3 --> 0:4:4,21
kept stopping people.


85
0:4:4,21 --> 0:4:6,69
And they didn't seem to mind
us riding along with them


86
0:4:6,69 --> 0:4:8,58
until they roadblocked the
actual highway, which,


87
0:4:8,58 --> 0:4:11,55
remember, is one of the main
drug routes into America.


88
0:4:11,55 --> 0:4:13,913
-The cops are going to
stop some cars and


89
0:4:13,913 --> 0:4:16,29
look for some drugs.


90
0:4:16,29 --> 0:4:18,16
Then as the sun was going down,
they warned us that we


91
0:4:18,16 --> 0:4:20,589
should leave because it was
very dangerous to even


92
0:4:20,589 --> 0:4:21,89
be seen with them.

around with them on the

back roads is one thing.

drug runners on

fun, boozy afternoon had some
unforeseen consequences.


102
0:4:43,17 --> 0:4:46,42
About an hour ago, a black
pickup sort of drove by really


103

slowly and then kind
of sped off.

like the ones Julian

0:4:50,92 --> 0:4:53,93
had pointed out earlier had
actually stopped, taken


106
0:4:53,93 --> 0:4:56,49
pictures, and checked us out.


107
0:4:56,49 --> 0:5:0,5
And all a sudden, our LeBaron
run around town drunk time


108
0:5:0,5 --> 0:5:1,54
didn't seem so smart anymore.


109
0:5:1,54 --> 0:5:2,31
-All right.


110
0:5:2,31 --> 0:5:5,45
So we have to leave now because
we shot today at the


111
0:5:5,45 --> 0:5:8,11
rodeo and then we did a drive-by
with the cops, so


112
0:5:8,11 --> 0:5:10,3
everybody in town knows
that we're here.


113
0:5:10,3 --> 0:5:13,82
And then we've just have a black
truck with black windows


114
0:5:13,82 --> 0:5:16,5
stop, pull up, check us out,
and then drive off.


115
0:5:16,5 --> 0:5:18,98
And a black truck, I just found
out, came by and took


116
0:5:18,98 --> 0:5:21,35
pictures of us before
I got here.


117
0:5:21,35 --> 0:5:23,9
So we have to go to another
hotel that we've arranged,


118

So we took off.


120

And when we called Brent to tell
him we had left, I half


121

expected him to say hey,
you're overreacting.

0:5:31,5 --> 0:5:32,19
It's nothing.


123
0:5:32,19 --> 0:5:33,54
But in actual fact,
when he heard the


124
0:5:33,54 --> 0:5:35,7
story, he said, oh yeah.

0:5:35,7 --> 0:5:36,32

out of Dodge.

Brent says "his family," he


132
0:5:53,1 --> 0:5:58,34
means presidential candidate
Mitt Romney's family.


133
0:5:58,34 --> 0:6:0,35
-Mitt is a relative.


134
0:6:0,35 --> 0:6:2,2
He's a second cousin.


135
0:6:2,2 --> 0:6:4,85
I wish Mitt would make contact
with us, and I really think


136
0:6:4,85 --> 0:6:6,31
that we could help him.
