17
0:1:21,27 --> 0:1:26,61
MSU scientists reported in this week's
edition of Science magazine that they had


18
0:1:26,61 --> 0:1:32,4
observed alleged "evolution" in viruses in
the lab.  Right off the bat, we need to


19
0:1:32,4 --> 0:1:37,44
address the sticky problem of just what is
"evolution" - how do you define it?  There


20
0:1:37,44 --> 0:1:40,91
seems to be not much doubt these
scientists are using the very weak


21
0:1:40,91 --> 0:1:46,2
definition of evolution as simply change
over time.  However as I pointed out in


22
0:1:46,2 --> 0:1:50,88
CrEvo Rant # 41, this definition makes a
great presidential campaign slogan, but


23
0:1:50,88 --> 0:1:56,55
fails miserably to describe evolution, as it
would include the evolution of the bicycle


24
0:1:56,55 --> 0:2:0,18
and languages (which are both
intelligently designed), and also include


25
0:2:0,18 --> 0:2:4,97
things like genetic entropy - which is the
opposite of evolution, but definitely


26
0:2:4,97 --> 0:2:9,74
change over time.  There is also the
problem of viruses not even being


27
0:2:9,74 --> 0:2:16,6
definable as "life" based on the
evoutionary definitions of life. So already


28
0:2:16,6 --> 0:2:20,44
the application of this research to
evolution is in question.


29
0:2:20,44 --> 0:2:26,11
This alleged "evolution" was rapid and
dramatic, with the virus undergoing four


30
0:2:26,11 --> 0:2:32,25
mutations that enabled it to attack E-coli
bacteria.  So - does this help evolution?


31
0:2:32,25 --> 0:2:37,0
Not really.  First of all, some may get
excited over this, believing that the first


32
0:2:37,0 --> 0:2:41,55
life on earth was perhaps a virus. In fact,
the Canadian Museum of Nature used to


33
0:2:41,55 --> 0:2:47,84
state this specifically in an audio exhibit.
However, viruses can't reproduce -


34
0:2:47,84 --> 0:2:52,9
viruses take over the reproduction
system of living cells to reproduce.


35
0:2:52,9 --> 0:2:58,18
Therefore viruses couldn't be the first life,
because they need other life to exist!


36
0:2:58,18 --> 0:3:10,47
Secondly, As Dr. Michael Behe pointed
out regarding the Science paper, 


37
0:3:10,47 --> 0:3:15,51
As Behe pointed out in his review on the
Evolution News website, the virus in the


38
0:3:15,51 --> 0:3:20,46
experiment wasn't the only thing
"evolving."  The bacteria that were being


39
0:3:20,46 --> 0:3:25,76
used as the target by the predator virus
were also rapidly changing in defense.


40
0:3:25,76 --> 0:3:30,3
This is well known in bacteria actually.
Cells, such as the bacteria, have


41
0:3:30,3 --> 0:3:34,71
receptors in their skin which link to
various biochemicals for signaling.


42
0:3:34,71 --> 0:3:40,26
Viruses "dock" to these bacteria using
these receptors, thus infecting the


43
0:3:40,26 --> 0:3:45,8
bacteria. But there are many different
receptors, and viruses can only dock to


44
0:3:45,8 --> 0:3:49,99
specific receptors.  When the bacteria
detected that the viruses were docking to


45
0:3:49,99 --> 0:3:54,51
one receptor, they destroyed the
receptor.  The virus then changed to be


46
0:3:54,51 --> 0:3:58,99
able to infect the bacteria using a sugar
called mannose that the bacteria brings


47
0:3:58,99 --> 0:4:4,1
into the cell.  The bacteria recognized the
infection, and destroyed the system


48
0:4:4,1 --> 0:4:8,34
which makes the sugar, and thus the
virus couldn't infect the bacteria.


49
0:4:8,34 --> 0:4:30,12
In the closing words of Behe:  


50
0:4:30,12 --> 0:4:35,64
Contrary to what most think, viruses are
actually an important part of life, and part


51
0:4:35,64 --> 0:4:40,74
of the big-picture system that produces
variety critical for life. Viruses actually


52
0:4:40,74 --> 0:4:44,88
carry disease resistance from one
organism to another.  Viruses that cause


53
0:4:44,88 --> 0:4:51,64
harm are actually evidence of something
gone wrong.  This was a perfect world, but


54
0:4:51,64 --> 0:4:55,47
just like you can ruin your car by
disregarding the specific instructions in


55
0:4:55,47 --> 0:4:59,99
the owner's manual written by the creator
of your car, so does disregarding the


56
0:4:59,99 --> 0:5:4,88
specific instructions in God's owner's
manual - the Bible, has caused problems


57
0:5:4,88 --> 0:5:9,96
throughout all of earth.  An excellent
article dealing with the subject of viruses


58
0:5:9,96 --> 0:5:15,88
and life by Dr. Jerry Bergman is available
on the trueorigin website.


59
0:5:15,88 --> 0:5:21,38
The British Museum of Natural History
had a short article on the horseshoe crab


60
0:5:21,38 --> 0:5:27,19
- allegeldy true proof of evolution, seeing
as how it hasn't changed (according to


61
0:5:27,19 --> 0:5:30,78
the evolutionary timescale) in 450 million
years, and has survived 3 of earth's major


62
0:5:30,78 --> 0:5:36,97
extinctions!  This article was a perfect
propaganda piece, putting all the spin in


63
0:5:36,97 --> 0:5:41,2
just the right places.  As I mentioned
briefly just a moment ago - if you ask the


64
0:5:41,2 --> 0:5:45,95
majority of evolutionary thinkers to define
evolution, almost all of them would say


65
0:5:45,95 --> 0:5:51,88
"change over time."  I disagree with that
vague definition, but it is useful in this


66
0:5:51,88 --> 0:5:57,55
case to make my point: Evolution requires
change over time. The horseshoe crab,


67
0:5:57,55 --> 0:6:3,16
and countless other organisms in the
fossil record, have not changed over time


68
0:6:3,16 --> 0:6:8,6
- this is called stasis.  But did that slow
them down from heralding the Horseshoe


69
0:6:8,6 --> 0:6:13,54
crab as proof of evolution? Oh heck no!
The last paragraph is actually entitled "A


70
0:6:13,54 --> 0:6:46,11
strange evolution?"


71
0:6:46,11 --> 0:6:52,71
This article is a classic example of just
how flexible evolution is.  No matter what


72
0:6:52,71 --> 0:6:57,95
the evidence is - evolution twists,
contorts and distorts itself to fit the


73
0:6:57,95 --> 0:7:3,84
evidence.  Uh folks - a "theory" that
explains all evidence, even contradictory


74
0:7:3,84 --> 0:7:10,24
evidence, is not science.  Such a theory is
clearly not falsifiable, and therefore not


75
0:7:10,24 --> 0:7:15,83
science.  Instead, the horseshoe crab
provides powerful evidence of creation -


76
0:7:15,83 --> 0:7:21,42
with organisms reproducing faithfully
after their kind, exactly like the book of


77
0:7:21,42 --> 0:7:25,5
Genesis says in its first chapter.


78
0:7:25,5 --> 0:7:29,52
Institute for Creation Research reported
on one of their research projects in this


79
0:7:29,52 --> 0:7:34,23
month's "Acts and Facts" - the study of
telomeres in the middle of DNA chains.


80
0:7:34,23 --> 0:7:39,19
Your DNA strands are clustered together
into 23 groups called chromosomes.


81
0:7:39,19 --> 0:7:44,53
Chimpanzee DNA is clustered into 24
chromosomes.  This causes a dilemna for


82
0:7:44,53 --> 0:7:48,19
evolution, because the great apes and
humans are supposed to have a common


83
0:7:48,19 --> 0:7:53,75
ancestor - but yet how does a 23
chromosome sperm fertilize a 24


84
0:7:53,75 --> 0:7:59,35
chromosome egg?  It can't!  So the
evolutionary thinkers - a certain Dr. Miller


85
0:7:59,35 --> 0:8:3,92
in particular, have proponed the idea that
somewhere in human ancestry, there was


86
0:8:3,92 --> 0:8:8,87
a fusion of two ape chromosomes into
one chromosome - specifically,


87
0:8:8,87 --> 0:8:14,9
chromosome #2.  Of course, he glosses
over the point that you have to have the


88
0:8:14,9 --> 0:8:19,39
exact same chromosomal fusion in a male
and a female, at the same time, and in the


89
0:8:19,39 --> 0:8:22,68
same place, and they have to mate!


90
0:8:22,68 --> 0:8:28,11
If you'll recall, DNA is a string of chemical
letters - G, C, T and A.  The end of the


91
0:8:28,11 --> 0:8:35,31
DNA strands in Chromosomes contain a
long repeating sequence of TTAGGG;


92
0:8:35,31 --> 0:8:40,18
usually this sequence is repeated
thousands of times to mark the end of the


93
0:8:40,18 --> 0:8:43,49
strand, and is called a telomere.


94
0:8:43,49 --> 0:8:47,57
So Miller went on record at the
Anti-Intelligent Design Kitzmiller /Dover


95
0:8:47,57 --> 0:8:52,29
court case to say that the human
chromosome 2 is actually two fused ape


96
0:8:52,29 --> 0:8:56,37
chromosomes - and claims it's proven
because there is a telomere sequence,


97
0:8:56,37 --> 0:9:0,16
right smack dab in the middle of the
human chromosome 2, exactly where we


98
0:9:0,16 --> 0:9:4,71
would expect that the two chromosomes
fused!  The anti-creationists have become


99
0:9:4,71 --> 0:9:9,23
quite arrogant with this alleged "fact" all
over youtube, posting videos with bold


100
0:9:9,23 --> 0:9:13,97
titles like "how to shut up pesky
creationists."  Well alas, not only does this


101
0:9:13,97 --> 0:9:18,68
NOT shut me up, it grants the creationary
community the perfect opportunity to


102
0:9:18,68 --> 0:9:24,62
show just how incredibly wrong, and even
deceitful, the anti-creationists can be.


103
0:9:24,62 --> 0:9:29,53
In the August 2011 Journal of Creation,
Doctors Tomkins and Bergman dropped a


104
0:9:29,53 --> 0:9:34,9
nuclear bomb on the claim of
chromosomal fusion. In fact, I'll have a


105
0:9:34,9 --> 0:9:39,19
rant hopefully coming out shortly just on
this subject.  Tomkins and Bergman


106
0:9:39,19 --> 0:9:45,59
showed conclusively that there is zero
evidence for a chromosomal fusion - for


107
0:9:45,59 --> 0:9:49,35
example: that alleged telomere sequence
in the middle of the human chromosome


108
0:9:49,35 --> 0:9:54,8
2? It was in completely the wrong place, it
is not a telomere because it is too short,


109
0:9:54,8 --> 0:10:1,1
and almost every chromosome has these
pseudo-telomeres in their middles.


110
0:10:1,1 --> 0:10:5,64
Contrary to what the ever-so-reliable
wikipedia says, the sequences on either


111
0:10:5,64 --> 0:10:10,64
side of the pseudo-telomere do not match
the DNA sequence of chimpanzees, as


112
0:10:10,64 --> 0:10:15,35
would be expected. There's much more to
this, but I will simply refer you to my blog


113
0:10:15,35 --> 0:10:20,4
post here, Tomkins wrote a brief laymans'
synopsis here, and of course, the


114
0:10:20,4 --> 0:10:23,44
technical article here.


115
0:10:23,44 --> 0:10:27,9
It is now being discovered that these
pseudo-telomeres have, of course,


116
0:10:27,9 --> 0:10:32,33
PURPOSE!  Gee, that's what the
creationists would say!  ICR has


117
0:10:32,33 --> 0:10:35,45
commissioned a research project looking
into the purposes of these


118
0:10:35,45 --> 0:10:37,6
pseudo-telomeres.


119
0:10:37,6 --> 0:10:42,58
Hot off the presses, and heating up the
anti-creation community, Indiana senate


120
0:10:42,58 --> 0:10:47,35
has approved a bill allowing the teaching
of creation in the science classroom.


121
0:10:47,35 --> 0:10:53,38
While the NCSE and ACLU get all hot
under the collar over this, the reality is


122
0:10:53,38 --> 0:10:58,5
that any teacher is already permitted to
teach creation in the classroom!  The US


123
0:10:58,5 --> 0:11:2,95
supreme court ruled on this years ago.
What the supreme court concluded was


124
0:11:2,95 --> 0:11:6,98
that school boards were not permitted to
force their teachers to teach creation -


125
0:11:6,98 --> 0:11:11,46
which frankly, I would agree.
But as this story unfolds, I would like to


126
0:11:11,46 --> 0:11:16,34
point it out to viewers to keep an eye on
what happens over the next little while.


127
0:11:16,34 --> 0:11:21,73
Notice how quickly lawsuits will come out
of this. Why? Because evolution must


128
0:11:21,73 --> 0:11:26,25
hide from scrutiny and questioning - but
there's only one place it can hide: behind


129
0:11:26,25 --> 0:11:32,56
judges, lawyers and school policies. This
is Anti-science, as true science welcomes


130
0:11:32,56 --> 0:11:34,43
scrutiny.


131
0:11:34,43 --> 0:11:39,44
[Dramatic, scary music]


132
0:11:39,44 --> 0:11:41,6
Wahoo! Mail for me?


133
0:11:41,6 --> 0:11:46,36
[Dramatic, scary music]


134
0:11:46,36 --> 0:11:50,84
In episode 4 of Genesis Week, I reported
on alleged multicelled yeast being


135
0:11:50,84 --> 0:11:56,24
produced in the lab.  Youtuber Tubenotme
wrote in suggesting that I clarify a point:


136
0:11:56,24 --> 0:11:59,63
in that show I had stated that the action
of the centrifuge had caused the


137
0:11:59,63 --> 0:12:5,18
clustering, which is not what the original
article said.  To clarify, I was aware of this,


138
0:12:5,18 --> 0:12:10,64
but I do still think that the extreme
G-forces did more than just sorting, I


139
0:12:10,64 --> 0:12:15,55
think those forces actually did contribute
to the production of the snowflake


140
0:12:15,55 --> 0:12:18,29
clusters, even if the authors disagree.


141
0:12:18,29 --> 0:12:21,96
A writer going by the name
Son_of_the_only_wise_god also wrote to


142
0:12:21,96 --> 0:13:5,87
me privately:


143
0:13:5,87 --> 0:13:10,18
Thanks for writing in, that is a significant
point.  Multicelled organisms have cells


144
0:13:10,18 --> 0:13:14,19
specializing in different jobs.  The
snowflake yeast cells did what yeast did


145
0:13:14,19 --> 0:13:19,33
best - because they were still yeast!  I
agree this had nothing to do with the


146
0:13:19,33 --> 0:13:22,41
evolution of multicellular life.


147
0:13:22,41 --> 0:13:27,59
In amongst his childish name-calling and
behaviour, Lawilson still insisted on


148
0:13:27,59 --> 0:13:31,69
taking me to task on the Paluxy tracks,
showing just how little he knows about


149
0:13:31,69 --> 0:13:58,78
them:


150
0:13:58,78 --> 0:14:3,25
Sure - but please note neither Ken Ham,
nor anyone else from AIG has ever


151
0:14:3,25 --> 0:14:8,95
actually spent time in the Paluxy, as I
have.  Let us also remember the task force


152
0:14:8,95 --> 0:14:13,24
assembled by the Twin Cities Creation
Science association, who published their


153
0:14:13,24 --> 0:14:17,48
conlusions in the book "Texas Tracks and
Artifacts."  After examining the evidence


154
0:14:17,48 --> 0:14:21,94
presented for and against the human
footprint interpretation, this team of


155
0:14:21,94 --> 0:14:26,54
scientists concluded that they were
genuine human footprints.  AIG and other


156
0:14:26,54 --> 0:14:30,68
creationists are apparently unaware of
this book, or have ignored it - as has the


157
0:14:30,68 --> 0:14:34,75
anti-creationary community.  
Morris retracted his original book


158
0:14:34,75 --> 0:14:38,37
because of errors in his book, and AIG
and other creationists have decided not


159
0:14:38,37 --> 0:14:43,75
to use the Paluxy evidence based on
Kuban's alleged "research" of the Paluxy


160
0:14:43,75 --> 0:14:49,48
tracks, and in particular, the red-stained
dinosaur tracks.  Kuban proponed that the


161
0:14:49,48 --> 0:14:53,67
human footprints were actually the result
of a dinosaur walking on its heels -


162
0:14:53,67 --> 0:14:58,29
metatarsal impressions.  For some
mysterious reason, Kuban never


163
0:14:58,29 --> 0:15:1,36
mentioned in any of his reports that
apparently the dinosaur's heels were


164
0:15:1,36 --> 0:15:6,19
dislocated, because the position of the
"heel" in each of the Taylor Trail tracks


165
0:15:6,19 --> 0:15:11,75
changed position as you go down the
trail!  Apparently the dinosaur's heel feel


166
0:15:11,75 --> 0:15:16,99
off and made its own trail, with the  6 track
landing squarely in the left toe of a


167
0:15:16,99 --> 0:15:22,72
dinosaur track from another dinosaur trail
going in the opposite direction!  This one


168
0:15:22,72 --> 0:15:28,25
track alone not only destroys Kuban's
hypothesis, it raises a disturbing


169
0:15:28,25 --> 0:15:33,13
question: Did Kuban not see this
red-stained dinosaur track, when he went


170
0:15:33,13 --> 0:15:39,1
there specifically to study the red-stained
dinosaur tracks? If so, what other crucial


171
0:15:39,1 --> 0:15:45,5
evidence did he miss?  Or did deliberately
leave out crucial information in his


172
0:15:45,5 --> 0:15:51,23
report?  In either case, Kuban has
demonstrated that his "research" is


173
0:15:51,23 --> 0:15:56,15
invalid and untrustworthy, and so is the
NCSE who apparently never bothered to


174
0:15:56,15 --> 0:16:1,7
check Kuban's "research."
Oddly enough, Kuban did mark the claw


175
0:16:1,7 --> 0:16:7,1
impressions of that particular dinosaur
track on his map.  So I will let the viewers


176
0:16:7,1 --> 0:16:11,54
draw their own conclusions about what
Kuban did and did not know, and what he


177
0:16:11,54 --> 0:16:14,55
did, and did not, report.


178
0:16:14,55 --> 0:16:17,58
Kuban also never seemed to notice that
the dinosaur footprints and human


179
0:16:17,58 --> 0:16:22,56
footprints erode differently - the human
footprints become eroded into a


180
0:16:22,56 --> 0:16:27,56
depression, while the dinosaur tracks
become raised - it's differential erosion.


181
0:16:27,56 --> 0:16:32,68
Clearly the dinosaur and human tracks
were made at two separate times.


182
0:16:32,68 --> 0:16:37,2
Lastly, lawilson has claimed that the CT
scans of the Delk track were invalidated -


183
0:16:37,2 --> 0:16:41,45
which they never were. The skeptics,
such as wilson, just choose not to believe


184
0:16:41,45 --> 0:16:45,99
the evidence. And yes, progress has been
made - in fact, we've had some 6 fossil


185
0:16:45,99 --> 0:16:50,53
human footprints, one carved human
footprint, and a carved test rock, all


186
0:16:50,53 --> 0:16:55,91
scanned on an industrial CT scanner.
Basically, with the exception of one of the


187
0:16:55,91 --> 0:17:0,85
fossil tracks which could not originally be
scanned on the medical scanner we


188
0:17:0,85 --> 0:17:5,82
originally used, the industrial CT scans
showed exactly what the Glen Rose


189
0:17:5,82 --> 0:17:12,75
medical scanner showed....only in higher
resolution.  So no, the CT scans were


190
0:17:12,75 --> 0:17:18,1
never invalidated, contrary to what
lawilson would like to believe.  I will be


191
0:17:18,1 --> 0:17:22,71
producing a video showing the scans
which number over 10,000 images.


192
0:17:22,71 --> 0:17:27,8
Equestions took lawilson and multiple
others to task in a very long series of


193
0:17:27,8 --> 0:17:31,77
posts regarding the Delk track, which I'm
just going to repeat here because it is


194
0:17:31,77 --> 0:20:27,12
very meaty and he hit the nail on the
head:


195
0:20:27,12 --> 0:20:31,57
Man, I wish I could buy you a coffee!  If
you send me your mailing address, I'll


196
0:20:31,57 --> 0:20:35,34
send you a Tim Horton's gift card, how
about that?  For more informaiton to see


197
0:20:35,34 --> 0:20:40,28
exactly what it was they were talking
about, the Delk track video is right here,


198
0:20:40,28 --> 0:20:44,69
in which I explain the CT scans performed
on the Delk track, and why they verify


199
0:20:44,69 --> 0:21:3,73
that both the dinosaur and human
footprints are genuine tracks.


200
0:21:3,73 --> 0:21:8,85
Thanks for writing in - it only violates the
establishment clause if it forces teachers


201
0:21:8,85 --> 0:21:13,84
to teach creation - or any specific religion.
You'll notice that the NCSE and others


202
0:21:13,84 --> 0:21:19,38
fight to even keep questioning of
evolution out of the schools.  Questioning


203
0:21:19,38 --> 0:21:21,5
is good science!


204
0:21:21,5 --> 0:21:24,26
I had a number of complaints from
youtubers mentioning that several


205
0:21:24,26 --> 0:21:28,41
comments were being marked as "spam".
I'd like to respectively ask people not to


206
0:21:28,41 --> 0:21:32,63
do this - I simply do not have time to sit
there and monitor all comments, and


207
0:21:32,63 --> 0:21:36,84
un-spam them. Especially because some
people were actually appreciating the


208
0:21:36,84 --> 0:21:40,81
debate and getting their opponents
comments marked as spam.


209
0:21:40,81 --> 0:21:45,42
I'd also like to ask your opinions as
viewers: it's been suggested I moderate


210
0:21:45,42 --> 0:21:49,66
the comments, which to date I have
avoided doing, for several reasons.  What


211
0:21:49,66 --> 0:21:53,13
do you think? Should I moderate and
delete abusive comments?  Should I turn


212
0:21:53,13 --> 0:21:57,4
off comments after a week? Give me your
opinions in the comments down below.


213
0:21:57,4 --> 0:22:0,85
Well that's enough for this week, thanks
for watching, and thanks for sharing this


214
0:22:0,85 --> 0:22:4,53
video with your friends using the
convenient "share" button down below.


215
0:22:4,53 --> 0:22:8,18
I'm your host Ian Juby, reminding you of
the words of Christ who said "I am the


216
0:22:8,18 --> 0:22:12,57
way, the Truth and the LIFE - no man
comes to the Father but through me."


217
0:22:12,57 --> 0:22:17,84
We'll see you next Thursday.


218
0:22:17,84 --> 0:22:22,63
Production Software was provided for Genesis 
Week by the Big Valley Creation Science


219
0:22:22,63 --> 0:22:27,29
Museum, located just 25 minutes north 
of Drumheller, Alberta. In the heart of the


220
0:22:27,29 --> 0:22:31,55
dinosaur badlands, the Big Valley Creation
Science Museum was built from the ground


221
0:22:31,55 --> 0:22:35,91
up to give credit to our Creator, portraying the
scientific evidence showing that creation is


222
0:22:35,91 --> 0:22:42,1
the faith that fits the facts, and that
evolution is the faith that the facts have failed.
