###0 STEVE SPANGLER: Well, it's happening according to plan.
###1 We're launching our big weather balloon in the middle
###3 of Denver, which is fantastic.
###6 10,000 screaming kids, and the balloon's ready to go up.
###10 10 minutes.
###11 It's going to be good.
###12 
###16 I'm Steve Spangler, and I'm all about making science fun.
###19 For the last 20 years, I've been teaching ways to turn
###22 ordinary science experiments into unforgettable learning
###25 experiences.
###26 I have an amazing team who will do whatever it takes to
###29 affect the way people think about science.
###32 And do that, I live by one motto--
###34 "Make it big, do it right, give it class."
###43 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###47 STEVE MEER: This is Edge of Space Sciences.
###49 And today's flight is flight number 175.
###77 LARRY NOBLE: OK, we have a PVC nozzle, which has been turned
###80 on a lathe.
###81 It's specially designed.
###83 It fits in the balloon and neck.
###86 So when this bag starts lifting off the ground, we
###89 know we have sufficient helium in the balloon to lift the
###93 entire payload string to the edge of space.
###97 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###111 MALE SPEAKER: Are you ready to get started?
###113 
###116 All right.
###116 Well, we're going to bring him up right now and introduce to
###118 you Steve Spangler.
###120 [CROWD CHEERING]
###124 STEVE SPANGLER: Welcome, everybody.
###125 You know, meteorologists have the coolest tools nowadays.
###129 They've got all this tracking device and everything else.
###132 But believe it or not, a long time ago, all they had was a
###135 simple balloon.
###136 So here is what a weather balloon looks like.
###140 Kids, you want one of these for your birthday.
###142 Just ask mom and dad, all right?
###144 [CHEERING]
###145 STEVE SPANGLER: Say, mom and dad, can I please have a
###147 weather balloon and about $500 of helium?
###150 It'll be awesome, right?
###152 The mere fact that I just unrolled this means that they
###155 probably can't launch this.
###156 We'll only use it for teaching purposes, because that balloon
###159 is so delicate.
###160 I told you early on that we partnered up with Edge of
###163 Space Science.
###165 Kathy is on the field right now with our team from Edge of
###167 Space Science.
###168 They're going to tell us a little bit about the weather
###170 balloon that we got permission to launch today.
###173 Kathy, tell us all about it.
###174 KATHY SABINE: Hey, Steve.
###175 I've got Steve Meer with me, and he is with
###178 Edge of Space Science.
###180 And this is a one of a kind event that you all are going
###183 to be witnessing today, isn't it?
###185 STEVE MEER: First time we've ever launched out of a stadium
###187 like this with so many people watching, so we're very
###189 excited to be here.
###190 KATHY SABINE: Is this the biggest weather
###191 balloon ever made?
###193 STEVE MEER: No, this is actually kind of a
###194 small one for us.
###195 This is what we call 1,200 grams.
###197 And it's got about 230 feet of helium in it when it leaves.
###201 When it gets up to the edge of space, it'll be about half the
###204 size of a school bus.
###205 KATHY SABINE: My colleagues are holding pieces of this
###208 weather balloon.
###209 Steve, can you kind of help me show the kids what
###211 we have behind us?
###212 STEVE MEER: Sure.
###213 So the first thing we have is a parachute.
###215 And so when the balloon breaks, it'll all come down
###217 under the parachute.
###218 It's about 5 feet in diameter.
###220 Then we come down to this payload right here, the green
###222 and orange one.
###224 This is the tracking and telemetry receiver.
###227 This sends us information about where the balloon is so
###229 we can find it.
###230 And if we need to abort the mission for some reason, we
###233 can send it a radio signal, and it'll cut the balloon
###235 away, and it'll come back under the parachute.
###237 KATHY SABINE: We've got Amelia down here.
###238 What's she holding?
###240 STEVE MEER: So Amelia's holding
###240 what we call the batmobile.
###242 The batmobile has two cameras in it--
###244 one that'll point down and one that points up.
###247 And then these long rods provide inertia so it doesn't
###250 spin too much under the thing.
###252 So hopefully on the website later today, you'll be able to
###254 see some cool video.
###255 KATHY SABINE: All right.
###256 Marty Coniglio's holding an orange box, Steve.
###258 STEVE MEER: So this orange box is another camera.
###260 This camera is also a high-def camera.
###262 And it's going to take video out to the side.
###263 In fact, it's taping us as we speak.
###266 And then again, the inertia rods to keep it
###267 from spinning so much.
###269 So Parker has probably the most important job here,
###272 because this is the main tracking and relay beacon.
###275 So this gives us the latitude and the
###277 longitude and the altitude.
###279 And it also serves as a relay point for all the trackers on
###281 the ground to talk through, so we know exactly where the
###283 balloon is at all times.
###284 KATHY SABINE: Now, Steve, I understand you had to get
###286 special permission, and we have to get a special window
###289 in sending this balloon up today.
###291 STEVE MEER: We very much want to stay out of the way of
###292 everything in the air that could suck
###294 it into their engines.
###294 So we're on a kind of a deadline here.
###297 And it's about time.
###297 KATHY SABINE: All right.
###298 I'm going to let you take over, then.
###299 STEVE MEER: OK, let's go--
###300 STEVE SPANGLER: Hey, Steve, Kathy, there's two things.
###302 Would you show us the flags that are on there?
###305 We have a Colorado Rockies flag.
###307 This is what we're going to bring back to 9NEWS today,
###309 hopefully for the 4 o'clock show.
###311 Everybody on the weather team signed that flag, so that
###315 we've got to be able to get that one back.
###317 And then we put a scientist on board.
###320 Never before has this scientist ever gone to the
###322 edge of space.
###323 Ladies and gentlemen, it's Beaker right there in the
###325 middle of the line.
###326 [CHEERING]
###327 STEVE SPANGLER: And you have to know that there's tracking
###329 devices on here.
###330 And we're going to learn something about it right now.
###333 Let me introduce to you the president of Edge of Space
###336 Sciences organization.
###338 It's Rob Wright.
###339 Nice round of applause for Rob.
###340 All right, Rob, how do you know where it's
###342 going to come down?
###343 I mean, what kind of tracking do you have to let it know
###345 where it's coming down?
###346 ROB WRIGHT: The National Weather Service compiles a lot
###348 of information about the upper-level winds.
###351 And what we do is we gather that information, we base that
###354 information on how fast our balloon is going up in the
###356 air, and what level it's going to hit
###358 those directional winds.
###360 And when we graph all that out, it shows us a nice line
###363 of where it's going to go direction-wise.
###365 STEVE SPANGLER: All right.
###365 So here we go with a prediction.
###366 Ready?
###367 You have to do a prediction for a science hypothesis, but
###370 this guy's on the line with his organization.
###373 I want you to look right into that camera.
###375 Tell us where it's going to come down, because that's
###376 where the chase team from 9NEWS and the Spangler Effect,
###379 we're all going.
###380 ROB WRIGHT: Hm, thank.
###381 All right.
###381 STEVE SPANGLER: All right, look right into the
###382 camera and tell them.
###383 ROB WRIGHT: We're going to land just north of Wiggins, I
###385 say about 10 miles.
###387 STEVE SPANGLER: Wow.
###387 All right?
###388 So 10 miles north of Wiggins.
###390 We've got a track team that's starting their way there so
###393 that they can see this all the way through.
###394 Nice round of applause for Rob, would ya?
###396 From Edge of Space Science.
###398 
###401 Here's what had to happen.
###402 In all seriousness, you don't normally launch from the
###406 middle of Denver.
###407 The FAA has given us permission for this window of
###411 opportunity.
###412 It means that air traffic right now for jets has been
###416 diverted around Denver for the next 10 minutes so that you
###419 can see a launch.
###420 I think that's pretty cool.
###422 So say thanks to the Edge of Space Science people.
###424 [CHEERING]
###427 STEVE SPANGLER: Kathy and Steve, are you ready?
###429 STEVE MEER: OK.
###430 We're good.
###430 STEVE SPANGLER: We're going to a countdown from 10.
###432 Are you ready?
###433 Here we go.
###434 10 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, let go!
###444 Here it goes.
###446 Here it goes.
###447 Here it goes.
###448 There's Beaker.
###449 I love it.
###450 Look at him go.
###453 Wow.
###453 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###566 
###657 SPEAKER: 93,715.
###659 93,715 was max.
###662 [INAUDIBLE].
###664 ROB WRIGHT: Made it up to 93,000 feet.
###666 It's currently at 92,800 feet.
###674 STEVE SPANGLER: I think you can call off
###675 the tracking team.
###676 I think we see it in the sky.
###677 So we'll just head towards that.
###679 SPEAKER: Oh, OK.
###680 You're all good.
###681 
###686 STEVE SPANGLER: See these guys over here?
###687 These are the mart guys.
###689 We've just got a car and a [INAUDIBLE].
###691 That's all we have.
###692 And some gummy bears and some chips.
###694 
###700 All right.
###701 We're here.
###702 I don't know where we are.
###703 All I know is there's a whole bunch of people, and it's
###705 supposed to be in that field somewhere.
###708 And I understand the farmer's not going to shoot us.
###710 So we can climb over the fence.
###712 We're going to go find the payload.
###713 Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.
###715 
###723 All right, so what does this do?
###725 DOUG: This is a directional antenna.
###726 STEVE SPANGLER: OK.
###727 DOUG: OK.
###727 And so what it does is it receives the signal really
###730 well here and not very well there.
###732 So you can hear it, right?
###733 STEVE SPANGLER: Right.
###733 DOUG: So when it's pointed at the payload, now I know which
###736 way I'm walking.
###737 If I point it over here, I'm not walking that way.
###739 STEVE SPANGLER: Oh, how cool is that?
###742 There it is.
###743 
###752 Look at this.
###752 It's from the end of the Spangler Effect.
###754 We have nothing.
###755 No Spangler Effect anymore.
###757 
###760 This is our flag.
###761 S-- that's as much as we have left.
###763 While the logos may not have lasted, look at this--
###766 Beaker made the flight.
###768 And he actually looks good.
###769 Doesn't look like there's any problem at all.
###772 He made the flight.
###773 Popped at 93,000 feet, and he's back down again.
###778 Edge of space--
###778 I can hardly wait to see the video of him just flopping
###781 around up here like this.
###783 This is really cool.
###784 At 11 o'clock today, we launched this
###787 massive weather balloon.
###788 We had a wonderful payload.
###789 And here we are at about 3 o'clock.
###791 We finally have tracked it 15 miles north of Snyder.
###794 The payload's intact.
###796 Looks like we have our GoPro cameras that will
###798 grab all of our video.
###800 Of course, the scientist is here.
###801 Beaker made it back.
###802 I have no idea what this guy saw.
###804 And our flag from 9NEWS all signed has come back as well.
###808 Success--
###809 this is the whole process, the scientific process.
###811 And it takes a team of really, really smart people to teach
###814 us how to do this.
###815 I just want to get kids excited about science.
###817 It's fun.
