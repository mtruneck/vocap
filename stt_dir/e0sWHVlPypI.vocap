###218 ZEITGEIST ADDENDUM
###244 "It is no measure of health to be well adjusted
###251 to a profoundly sick society. " J. Krishnamurti
###265 -Society today, is composed of a series of institutions.
###270 .
###271 From political institutions
###272 legal institutions
###274 religious institutions.
###276 To institutions of social class
###278 familial values
###280 and occupational specialization.
###282 It is obvious the profound influence
###284 these traditionalized structures have
###286 in shaping our understandings and perspectives.
###291 Yet, of all the social institutions, we are born into
###294 directed by and conditioned upon
###297 there seems to be no system as taken for granted
###300 and misunderstood
###302 as the monetary system.
###305 Taking on nearly religious proportions
###307 the established monetary institution exists
###310 as one of the most unquestioned forms of faith there is.
###314 How money is created, the policies by which it is governed
###318 .
###318 and how it truly affects society
###320 are unregistered interests of the great majority of the population.
###333 In a world where 1% of the population owns 40% of the planet's wealth.
###338 In a world where 34.000 children die every single day
###343 from poverty and preventable diseases
###345 and where 50% of the world's population
###348 lives on less than 2 dollars a day...
###351 One thing is clear.
###353 Something is very wrong.
###356 And, whether we are aware of it or not
###358 the lifeblood of all of our established institutions
###361 and thus society itself, is money.
###365 Therefore, understanding this institution of monetary policy
###369 is critical to understanding why our lives are the way they are.
###373 Unfortunately, economics is often viewed with confusion and boredom.
###377 Endless streams of financial jargon
###380 coupled with intimidating mathematics
###382 quickly deters people from attempts at understanding it.
###385 However, the fact is:
###387 The complexity associated with the financial system is a mere mask
###391 designed to conceal one of the most socially paralyzing structures
###396 humanity has ever endured.
###405 "None are more hopelessly enslaved
###409 than those who falsely believe they are free."
###413 -Johann Wolfgang von Goethe - 1749-1832
###418 -A number of years ago
###419 the central bank of the United States, the Federal Reserve
###422 produced a document entitled "Modern Money Mechanics".
###426 This publication detailed the institutionalized practice
###430 of money creation as utilized by the Federal Reserve
###433 and the web of global commercial banks it supports.
###436 On the opening page the document states its objective:
###439 "The purpose of this booklet is to describe
###441 the basic process of money creation
###443 in a 'fractional reserve' banking system."
###446 It then proceeds to describe this fractional reserve process
###450 through various banking terminology.
###452 A translation of which goes something like this:
###456 The United States government decides it needs some money.
###459 So it calls up the Federal Reserve
###461 and requests, say, 10 billion dollars.
###464 The FED replies saying:
###466 "Sure, we'll buy ten billion in government bonds from you".
###469 So the government takes some pieces of paper
###472 paints some official looking designs on them
###474 and calls them treasury bonds.
###476 Then it puts a value on these bonds to the sum of 10 billion dollars
###480 and sends them over to the FED.
###482 In turn, the people of the FED
###484 draw up a bunch of impressive pieces of papers themselves
###487 only this time, calling them "Federal Reserve notes"
###490 also designating a value of ten billion dollars to the set.
###494 The FED then takes these notes and trades them for the bonds.
###498 Once this exchange is complete
###500 the government then takes the ten billion in federal reserve notes
###503 and deposits it into an bank account.
###506 And, upon this deposit
###508 the paper notes officially become legal tender money
###511 adding ten billion to the US money supply.
###514 And there it is, ten billion in new money has been created.
###518 Of course, this example is a generalization.
###521 For, in reality, this transaction would occur electronically
###525 with no paper used at all.
###527 In fact, only 3% of the US money supply exists in physical currency.
###533 The other 97 percent essentially exists in computers alone.
###538 Now, government bonds are by design instruments of debt.
###542 And when the FED purchases these bonds
###545 with money essentially created out of thin air
###547 the government is actually promising
###549 to pay back that money to the FED.
###553 In other words, the money was created out of debt.
###557 This mind numbing paradox
###559 of how money or value can be created out of debt or a liability
###563 will become more clear as we further this exercise.
###567 So, the exchange has been made
###569 and now ten billion dollars sits in a commercial bank account.
###572 Here is where it gets really interesting.
###574 For, as based on the fractional reserve practice
###577 that ten billion dollar deposit
###579 instantly becomes part of the bank's reserves
###582 just as all deposits do.
###585 And, regarding reserve requirements
###587 as stated in "Modern Money Mechanics":
###590 "A bank must maintain legally required reserves
###593 equal to a prescribed percentage of its deposits".
###596 It then quantifies this by stating: "Under current regulations
###600 .
###600 the reserve requirement against most transaction accounts is 10%".
###606 This means that with a ten billion dollar deposit
###608 10%, or one billion, is held as the required reserve
###613 .
###613 while the other nine billion is considered an excessive reserve
###617 and can be used as the basis for new loans.
###621 .
###621 Now, it is logical to assume, that this nine billion
###625 is literally coming out of the existing ten billion dollar deposit.
###629 However, this is actually not the case.
###631 What really happens, is that the nine billion
###633 is simply created out of thin air
###636 on top of the existing 10 billion dollar deposit.
###639 This is how the money supply is expanded.
###642 As stated in "Modern Money Mechanics":
###644 "Of course they" -the banks-
###646 "do not really pay out loans for the money they receive as deposits.
###650 If they did this, no additional money would be created.
###653 What they do when they make loans
###655 is to accept promissory notes" -loan contracts-
###658 "in exchange for credits" -money-
###660 "to the borrowers' transaction accounts."
###662 In other words, the nine billion can be created out of nothing
###666 simply because there is a demand for such a loan
###669 and that there is a 10 billion dollar deposit
###671 to satisfy the reserve requirements.
###675 Now, let's assume that somebody walks into this bank
###678 and borrows the newly available nine billion dollars.
###681 They will then most likely take that money
###683 and deposit it into their own bank account.
###688 The process then repeats.
###689 For that deposit becomes part of the bank's reserves.
###692 10% is isolated and in turn 90% of the nine billion, or 8.1 billion
###698 is now available as newly created money for more loans.
###701 And, of course, that 8.1 can be loaned out and redeposited
###705 creating an additional 7.2 billion.
###708 To 6.5 billion... to 5.9 billion... etc.
###714 This deposit money creation loan cycle
###717 can technically go on to infinity.
###719 The average mathematical result is that about 90 billion dollars
###723 can be created on top of the original 10 billion.
###727 In other words, for every deposit
###729 that ever occurs in the banking system
###731 about nine times that amount can be created out of thin air.
###736 Money-Jitters. Ask the obliging Bank of America
###739 for a jar of soothing instant money.
###742 M-O-N-E-Y in the form of a convenient personal loan.
###748 So, now that we understand how money is created
###752 by this fractional reserve banking system
###754 a logical yet illusive question might come to mind:
###758 What is actually giving this newly created money value?
###762 The answer: the money that already exists.
###766 The new money essentially steals value from the existing money supply.
###771 For the total pool of money is being increased
###774 irrespective to demand for goods and services.
###777 And, as supply and demand finds equilibrium, prices rise
###781 diminishing the purchasing power of each individual dollar.
###785 This is generally referred to as inflation.
###788 And inflation is essentially a hidden tax on the public.
###793 -What is the advice that you generally get?
###795 And that is, inflate the currency.
###796 They don't say: debase the currency.
###798 They don't say: devalue the currency.
###800 They don't say: cheat the people who are safe.
###802 They say: lower the interest rates.
###804 The real deception is when we distort the value of money.
###807 When we create money out of thin air, we have no savings.
###811 Yet there's so called "capital".
###813 So, my question boils down to this:
###815 How in the world can we expect to solve the problems of inflation
###821 that is the increase in the supply of money, with more inflation?
###825 -Of course, it can't.
###827 The fractional reserve system of monetary expansion
###830 is inherently inflationary.
###832 For the act of expanding the money supply,
###834 without there being a proportional expansion of goods and services
###838 in the economy, will always debase a currency.
###841 In fact, a quick glance at the historical values of the US dollar
###845 versus the money supply, reflects this point definitively
###849 for the inverse relationship is obvious.
###853 One dollar in 1913 required $21.60 in 2007 to match value.
###862 That is a 96% devaluation
###865 since the Federal Reserve came into existence.
###870 Now, if this reality of inherent and perpetual inflation
###874 seems absurd and economically self defeating
###878 hold that thought, for absurdity is an understatement
###882 in regard to how our financial system really operates.
###886 For in our financial system money is debt
###891 and debt is money.
###893 Here is a chart of the US money supply from 1950 to 2006.
###899 Here is a chart of the US national debt for the same period.
###903 How interesting it is that the trends are virtually the same.
###907 For the more money there is, the more debt there is.
###910 The more debt there is, the more money there is.
###913 To put it a different way, every single dollar in your wallet
###917 is owed to somebody by somebody. For remember:
###921 The only way the money can come into existence is from loans.
###924 Therefore, if everyone in the country were able to pay off all debts
###928 including the government
###930 there would not be one dollar in circulation.
###934 "If there were no debts in our money system
###937 there wouldn't be any money."
###939 -Marriner Eccles- Governor of the Federal Reserve September 30th, 1941
###943 -In fact, the last time in American history
###946 the national debt was completely paid off was in 1835
###950 after president Andrew Jackson shut down the central bank
###954 that preceded the Federal Reserve.
###956 In fact, Jackson's entire political platform essentially revolved
###960 around his commitment to shut down the central bank.
###963 Stating at one point:
###965 "The bold efforts the present bank has made to control the government
###968 are but premonitions of the fate that awaits the American people
###972 should they be deluded into a perpetuation of this institution
###975 or the establishment of another like it."
###978 Unfortunately his message was short lived,
###981 and the international bankers succeeded
###982 to install another central bank in 1913, the Federal Reserve.
###988 And as long as this institution exists, perpetual debt is guaranteed.
###994 .
###994 Now, so far we have discussed the reality
###997 that money is created out of debt through loans.
###1001 These loans are based on a bank's reserves
###1003 and reserves are derived from deposits.
###1005 And through this fractional reserve system
###1008 any one deposit can create 9 times its original value.
###1012 In turn, debasing the existing money supply
###1015 raising prices in society.
###1017 And, since all this money is created out of debt
###1020 and circulated randomly through commerce
###1023 people become detached from their original debt
###1026 and a disequilibrium exists
###1028 where people are forced to compete for labor
###1031 in order to pull enough money out of the money supply
###1034 to cover their costs of living.
###1038 As dysfunctional and backwards as all of this might seem
###1041 there is still one thing we have omitted from this equation.
###1045 And it is this element of the structure
###1048 which reveals the truly fraudulent nature of the system itself.
###1053 The application of interest.
###1058 When the government borrows money from the FED
###1060 or when a person borrows money from a bank
###1063 it almost always has to be paid back with accrued interest.
###1068 In other words, almost every single dollar that exists
###1071 must be eventually returned to a bank with interest paid as well.
###1075 But, if all money is borrowed from the Central Bank
###1079 and is expanded by commercial banks through loans
###1083 only what would be referred to as the "principal"
###1086 is being created in the money supply.
###1089 So then, where is the money
###1091 to cover all of the interest that is charged?
###1094 Nowhere.
###1096 It doesn't exist.
###1098 The ramifications of this are staggering
###1100 for the amount of money owed back to the banks will always exceed
###1104 the amount of money that is available in circulation.
###1108 This is why inflation is a constant in the economy
###1111 for new money is always needed
###1113 to help cover the perpetual deficit built into the system
###1117 caused by the need to pay the interest.
###1120 What this also means, is that mathematically
###1123 defaults and bankruptcy are literally built into this system
###1127 and there will always be poor pockets of society
###1130 that get the short end of the stick.
###1132 An analogy would be a game of musical chairs
###1135 for the once music stops, somebody is left out to dry.
###1139 And that's the point.
###1141 It invariably transfers true wealth from the individual to the banks.
###1145 For, if you are unable to pay for your mortgage
###1148 they will take your property.
###1150 This is particularly enraging when you realize
###1152 that not only is such a default inevitable
###1155 due to the fractional reserve practice, but also because of the fact
###1159 that the money that the bank loaned to you
###1162 didn't even legally exist in the first place.
###1165 In 1969 there was a Minnesota court case
###1168 involving a man named Jerome Daly
###1171 who was challenging the foreclosure of his home by the bank
###1174 which provided the loan to purchase it.
###1176 His argument was that the mortgage contract
###1178 required both parties -being he and the bank-
###1181 each put up a legitimate form of property for the exchange.
###1186 In legal language this is called consideration:
###1189 [ a contract's basis. a contract is founded on an exchange
###1192 of one form of consideration for another. ]
###1194 Mr. Daly explained that the money was, in fact
###1197 not the property of the bank, for it was created out of nothing
###1201 as soon as the loan agreement was signed.
###1203 Remember what "Modern Money Mechanics" stated about loans?
###1206 "What they do, when they make loans, is to
###1208 accept promissory notes in exchange for credits.
###1211 Reserves are unchanged by the loan transactions.
###1214 But, deposit credits constitute new additions
###1217 to the total deposits of the banking system."
###1220 In other words, the money doesn't come out of their existing assets.
###1224 The bank is simply inventing it, putting up nothing of its own
###1227 except for a theoretical liability on paper.
###1230 As the court case progressed
###1232 the bank's president Mr. Morgan took the stand
###1235 and in the judge's personal memorandum, he recalled that
###1239 the Plaintiff - bank's president - admitted that
###1241 in combination with the Federal Reserve Bank
###1244 did create the money and credit upon its books by book-keeping entry.
###1248 The money and credit first came into existence when they created it.
###1252 Mr. Morgan admitted that
###1253 no US Law or Statute existed which gave him the right to do this.
###1258 A lawful consideration must exist and be tendered to support the note.
###1263 The Jury found that there was no lawful consideration and I agree.
###1266 He also poetically added:
###1268 "Only God can create something of value out of nothing".
###1272 And, upon this revelation
###1274 the court rejected the bank's claim for foreclosure
###1277 and Daly kept his home.
###1279 The implications of this court decision are immense.
###1282 For every time you borrow money from a bank
###1285 whether it is a mortgage loan or a credit card charge
###1289 the money given to you is not only counterfeit
###1291 it is an illegitimate form of consideration
###1294 and hence, voids the contract to repay.
###1297 For the bank never had the money as property to begin with.
###1301 Unfortunately such legal realizations are suppressed and ignored.
###1305 And the game of perpetual wealth transfer and perpetual debt continues.
###1311 And this brings us to the ultimate question:
###1313 Why?
###1316 During the American Civil War
###1318 President Lincoln bypassed the high interest loans
###1321 offered by the European banks
###1323 and decided to do what the founding fathers advocated
###1327 which was to create an independent and inherently debt-free currency.
###1331 It was called "The Greenback".
###1335 Shortly after this measure was taken, an internal document circulated
###1340 between private British and American banking interests, stated:
###1344 "...slavery is but the owning of labor
###1346 and carries with it the care of laborers.
###1349 While the European plan
###1351 is that capital shall control labor by controlling wages.
###1355 This can be done by controlling the money.
###1358 It will not do to allow the Greenback... as we cannot control that."
###1363 The fractional reserve policy
###1365 perpetrated by the Federal Reserve which has spread in practice
###1369 to the great majority of banks in the world
###1371 is, in fact, a system of modern slavery.
###1379 Think about it, money is created out of debt.
###1383 And what the people do when they are in debt?
###1386 They submit to employment to pay it off.
###1389 But if money only can only be created out of loans
###1392 how can society ever be debt free?
###1395 It can't and that's the point.
###1398 And it is the fear of losing assets
###1401 coupled with the struggle to keep up
###1403 with the perpetual debt and inflation inherent in the system
###1407 compounded by the inescapable scarcity within the money supply itself
###1411 created by the interest that can never be repaid
###1416 that keeps the wage-slave in line.
###1419 Running on a hamster wheel, with millions of others
###1423 in effect powering an empire
###1425 that truly benefits only the elite at the top of the pyramid.
###1430 For, at the end of the day, who are you really working for?
###1435 .
###1435 The banks.
###1437 Money is created in a bank and invariably ends up in a bank.
###1441 They are the true masters
###1443 along with the corporations and governments they support.
###1448 Physical slavery requires people to be housed and fed.
###1452 Economic slavery requires people to feed and house themselves.
###1458 It is one of the most ingenious scams
###1460 for social manipulation ever created.
###1462 And at its core
###1464 it is an invisible war against the population.
###1467 Debt is the weapon used to conquer and enslave societies
###1472 and interest is its prime ammunition.
###1476 And, as the majority walks around oblivious to this reality
###1481 the banks in collusion with governments and corporations
###1484 continue to perfect and expand their tactics of economic warfare
###1489 spawning new bases, such as the World Bank
###1492 and International Monetary Fund [IMF]
###1495 while also inventing a new type of soldier:
###1498 The birth of the Economic Hit Man.
###1506 "There are two ways to conquer and enslave a nation.
###1509 One is by sword. The other is by debt." - John Adams - 1735-1826
###1514 -We economic hit men, really have been the ones responsible for creating
###1517 this first truly global empire and we work many different ways.
###1522 John Perkins Former Chief Economist for Chas. T. Main Inc. Author: Confessions of an Economic Hitman
###1526 But perhaps the most common is that we will
###1529 identify a country that has resources our corporations covet, like oil
###1534 and then, arrange a huge loan to that country
###1537 from the World Bank or one of its sister organizations.
###1540 But the money never actually goes to the country.
###1542 Instead it goes to our big corporations
###1544 to built infrastructure projects in that country.
###1546 Power plants, industrial parks, ports.
###1549 Things that benefit a few rich people in that country
###1552 in addition to our corporations
###1553 but really don't help the majority of the people at all.
###1556 However, those people, the whole country is left holding a huge debt.
###1560 It's such a big debt they can't repay it and that's part of the plan
###1563 that they can't repay it. And so, at some point
###1565 we economic hit men, go back to them and say, "Listen,
###1568 you owe us a lot of money. You can't pay your debt. So, sell your oil
###1572 real cheap to our oil companies
###1574 allow us to build a military base in your country", or
###1577 "send troops in support of ours to someplace in the world like Iraq"
###1581 or "vote with us in the next UN vote", to have their
###1585 electric utility company privatized and
###1587 their water and sewage system privatized
###1589 and sold to US corporations or other multinational corporations.
###1593 So there is a whole mushrooming thing and
###1595 it's so typical of the way the IMF and the World Bank work.
###1598 They put a country in debt and it's such a big debt it can't pay it
###1602 and then you offer to refinance that debt and pay even more interest
###1607 and you demand this quid pro quo
###1611 which you call a "conditionality" or "good governance"
###1614 which means basically that they've got to sell off their resources
###1617 including many of their social services, their utility companies,
###1621 their school systems sometimes, their penal systems
###1625 their insurance systems, to foreign corporations.
###1629 So it's a double - triple - quadruple whammy!
###1634 IRAN; 1953
###1636 The precedent for economic hit men really began back in the early 50's
###1640 when the democratically elected Mossadegh who was elected in Iran.
###1644 He was considered to be the hope for democracy in the middle east
###1647 and around the world. He was in Time-Magazine's "Man of the year". But...
###1650 one of the things that he ran on and began to implement was
###1653 the idea that foreign oil companies needed to pay the Iranian people
###1657 a lot more for the oil that they were taking out of Iran
###1659 and the Iranian people should benefit from their own oil. Strange policy.
###1664 We didn't like that of course. But...
###1666 we were afraid to do what we normally were doing
###1668 which was to send in the military. Instead we sent in one CIA agent
###1673 Kermit Roosevelt, Teddy Roosevelt's relative.
###1678 And Kermit went in with a few million dollars and
###1680 was very, very effective and efficient and in a short amount of time
###1684 he managed to get Mossadegh overthrown
###1687 and brought in the shah of Iran to replace him
###1690 who always was favorable to oil. And it was extremely effective.
###1694 [ Revolt in Iran ]
###1698 "Mobs overthrow Tehran.
###1699 Army officers shout that Mossadegh has surrendered and his regime as
###1703 virtual dictator of Iran is ended. Pictures of the Shah are paraded
###1707 through the streets as sentiment reverses. The Shah is welcomed home."
###1714 So back here in the United States, in Washington
###1717 people looked around and said: "Wow, that was easy and cheap".
###1720 So this established a whole new way
###1724 of manipulating countries, of creating empire.
###1727 The only problem with Roosevelt was that he was a
###1729 card carrying CIA agent. And if he'd been caught
###1733 the ramifications could have been pretty serious.
###1736 So very quickly, at that point, the decision was made to
###1738 use private consultants to channel the money through the
###1742 World Bank or the IMF or one of the other such agencies
###1745 to bring in people like me, who worked for private companies.
###1749 So that if we got caught
###1751 there would be no governmental ramifications.
###1755 GUATEMALA 1954
###1762 When Árbenz became president of Guatemala
###1764 the country was very much under the thumbs of
###1766 United Fruit company, the big international corporations
###1770 and Árbenz ran on this ticket that said: "You know
###1772 we want to give the land back to the people".
###1775 And once he took power, he was implementing policies that would
###1779 would do exactly that, give the land rights back to the people.
###1782 United Fruit didn't like that very much.
###1784 And so, they hired a public relations firm, launched a huge campaign
###1788 in the United States to convince the United States people
###1791 the citizens of the United States, the press of the United States and
###1793 the Congress of the United States, that Árbenz was a soviet puppet
###1797 and that if we allowed him to stay in power
###1799 the Soviets would have a foothold in this hemisphere.
###1802 And that, at that point in time, was a huge fear on everybody's mind
###1806 of the red terror, the communist terror.
###1808 And so, to make a long story short, out of this public relations campaign
###1813 came a commitment on the part of the CIA and the military to take this man out.
###1817 And in fact, we did. We sent in planes, we sent in soldiers, we sent
###1822 in jackals, we sent everything in to take him out. And did take him out.
###1825 And as soon as he was removed from office
###1828 the new guy that took over after him basically reinstated everything to
###1832 the big international corporations, including United Fruit.
###1840 [Ecuador 1981] Ecuador, for many, many years had been ruled by pro-US dictators
###1844 often relatively brutal. Then it was decided they were gonna have
###1848 a truly democratic election. Jaime Roldós ran for office and his main goal
###1853 he said, as president would be to make sure that Ecuador's
###1857 resources were used to help the people. And he won. Overwhelming.
###1862 By more votes than anybody had ever won anything in Ecuador.
###1865 And he began to implement these policies.
###1868 To make sure that the profits from oil went to help the people.
###1872 Well, we didn't like that in the United States.
###1874 I was sent down as one of several economic hit men to change Roldós.
###1879 To corrupt him. To bring him around. To let him know, you know.
###1883 "Ok, you know, you can get very rich, you and your family, if you play
###1887 our game. But if you continue to try to keep these policies you've promised
###1891 you're gonna go. " He wouldn't listen.
###1896 He was assassinated.
###1899 As soon as the plane crashed, the whole area was cordoned off.
###1903 The only people allowed in were US military from a nearby base
###1907 and some of the Ecuadorian military.
###1909 When an investigation was launched
###1911 two of the key witnesses died in car accidents
###1914 before they had a chance to testify.
###1916 A lot of very, very strange things that went on around
###1919 the assassination of Jaime Roldós.
###1922 I, like most people who've really looked at this case
###1926 have absolutely no doubt that it was an assassination.
###1928 And, of course, in my position as an economic hit man
###1931 I was always expecting something to happen to Jaime
###1933 whether it'd be a coup or assassination, I wasn't sure, but that
###1936 he would be taken down, because he was not being corrupted, he would
###1939 not allow himself to be corrupted the way we wanted to corrupt him.
###1944 PANAMA 1981
###1948 Omar Torrijos, president of Panama
###1950 was, you know, one of my favorite people. I really, really liked him.
###1953 He was very charismatic. He was a guy who really wanted to help his country.
###1956 And when I tried to bribe him or corrupt him, he said: "Look, John"
###1960 - he called me Juanito - He said: "Look Juanito,
###1963 I don't need the money. What I really need is for my country
###1968 to be treated fairly. I need for the US to repay the
###1972 debts that you owe my people for all the destruction you've done here.
###1975 I need to be in a position where I can help other Latin American countries
###1980 win their independence and be free of this
###1982 of this terrible presence from the North.
###1985 You people are exploiting us so badly.
###1987 I need to have the Panama Canal back in the hands of the Panamanian people.
###1992 That's what I want.
###1993 And so, leave me alone, don't, you know, don't try to bribe me".
###1998 It was 1981 and, in May, Jaime Roldos was assassinated.
###2004 And Omar was very aware of this.
###2006 Torrijos got his family together and he said:
###2009 "I'm probably next, but it's OK
###2012 because I've done what I came here to do
###2016 I've renegotiated the Canal.
###2018 The Canal will now be in our hands. " He'd just finished negotiating
###2021 the treaty with Jimmy Carter.
###2026 In June of that same year, just a couple of months later
###2029 he also went down in an airplane crash
###2032 which, there's no question, was executed by CIA sponsored jackals.
###2037 A tremendous amount of evidence that
###2038 one of Torijos' security guards handed him, at the last moment
###2043 as he was getting on the plane, a tape recorder.
###2045 A small tape recorder that contained a bomb.
###2053 VENEZUELA 2002
###2055 It is interesting to me how this
###2057 system has continued pretty much the same way
###2060 for years and years and years, except the economic hit men
###2062 have got better and better and better.
###2064 Then we come up with, very recently, what happened in Venezuela.
###2069 In 1998, Hugo Chavez gets elected president
###2072 following a long line of presidents
###2074 who'd been very corrupt and basically destroyed the economy
###2077 of the country. And Chavez was elected amidst all that.
###2081 Chavez stood up to the United States
###2084 and he's done it primarily demanding that Venezuelan oil
###2088 be used to help the Venezuelan people.
###2092 Well, we didn't like that in the United States.
###2095 So in 2002
###2097 a coup was staged, which there's no question in my mind
###2100 and most other people's minds, that the CIA was behind that coup.
###2109 The way that that coup was fomented
###2111 was very reflective of what Kermit Roosevelt had done in Iran.
###2114 Of paying people to go out onto the streets
###2117 to riot, to protest, to say that Chavez was very unpopular.
###2121 You know, if you can get a few thousand people to do that
###2125 television can make it look like it's the whole country
###2129 and things start to mushroom.
###2131 Except in the case of Chavez, he was smart enough
###2135 and the people were so strongly behind him, that they overcame it
###2141 .
###2141 which was a phenomenal moment in the history of Latin America.
###2147 IRAQ 2003
###2149 Iraq, actually, is a perfect example
###2152 of the way the whole system works.
###2154 So we, economic hit men, are the first line of defense.
###2157 We go in, we try to corrupt the governments
###2159 and get them to accept these huge loans
###2162 which we then use as leverage to basically own them.
###2165 If we fail, as I failed in Panama with Omar Torrijos
###2169 and Ecuador with Jaime Roldós, men who refused to be corrupted
###2174 then the second line of defense is we send in the jackals.
###2176 And the jackals either overthrow governments or they assassinate.
###2179 And, once that happens and a new government comes in
###2182 boy it's gonna tow the line because
###2184 that new president knows what will happen if he doesn't.
###2187 In the case of Iraq, both of those things failed.
###2191 The economic hit men were not able to get through to Saddam Hussein.
###2194 We tried very hard, we tried to get him to accept a deal
###2197 very similar to what the House of Saud had accepted in Saudi Arabia
###2200 but he wouldn't accept it.
###2202 And so the jackals went in to take him out.
###2204 They couldn't do it. His security was very good.
###2207 After all, he at one time, worked for the CIA.
###2210 He'd been hired to assassinate a former president of Iraq and failed
###2214 but he knew the system.
###2216 So, in '91, we send in the troops and we take out the Iraqi military.
###2222 .
###2222 So, we assume at that point
###2224 that Saddam Hussein is gonna come around.
###2226 We could have taken him out, of course at that time
###2229 but we didn't want to. He's the kind of strong man we like.
###2232 He controls his people. We thought he could control the Kurds
###2235 and keep the Iranians in their border and keep pumping oil for us.
###2238 And that once we took out his military, now he's gonna come around.
###2242 So the economic hit men go back in in the 90's, without success.
###2246 .
###2246 If they'd had success he'd still be running the country.
###2249 We'd be selling him all the fighter jets he wants
###2252 and everything else he wants, but they couldn't; they didn't have success.
###2255 The jackals couldn't take him out again
###2257 so we sent the military in once again
###2259 and this time we did the complete job and took him out.
###2262 And in the process, created for ourselves
###2263 some very, very lucrative construction deals
###2267 to reconstruct the country that we'd essentially destroyed.
###2270 Which is a pretty good deal
###2272 if you own construction companies, big ones.
###2275 So, Iraq shows the three stages.
###2278 The economic hit men failed there.
###2281 The jackals failed there. And as a final measure the military goes in.
###2288 And in that way we've really created an empire
###2291 but we've done it very, very subtly. It's clandestine.
###2294 All empires of the past were built on the military
###2297 and everybody knew they were building them.
###2299 The British knew they were building them, the French
###2301 the Germans, the Romans, the Greeks
###2304 and they were proud of it, and they always had some excuse
###2306 like spreading civilization, spreading some religion
###2310 something like that, but they knew they were doing it.
###2313 We don't.
###2314 The majority of the people in the United States have no idea
###2318 that we're living off the benefits of the clandestine empire.
###2321 That today there is more slavery in the world than ever before.
###2328 Then you have to ask yourself;
###2329 well, if it's an empire, then who is the emperor?
###2332 Obviously our Presidents of the United States are not emperors.
###2336 An emperor is someone who is not elected
###2338 doesn't serve a limited term
###2340 and doesn't report to anyone, essentially.
###2342 So you can't classify our presidents that way.
###2346 But we do have what I consider to be the equivalent of the emperor
###2349 and it's what I call the corporatocracy.
###2352 The corporatocracy is this group of individuals
###2355 who run our biggest corporations.
###2357 And they really act as the emperor of this empire.
###2361 They control our media
###2364 either through direct ownership or advertising.
###2366 They control most of our politicians
###2369 because they finance their campaigns
###2371 either through the corporations or through personal contributions
###2374 .
###2374 that come out of the corporations.
###2376 They're not elected, then don't serve a limited term
###2379 .
###2379 they don't report to anybody
###2380 and at the very top of the corporatocracy
###2383 you really can't tell whether the person
###2385 is working for a private corporation or the government
###2387 because they're always moving back and forth.
###2389 So, you know, you've got a guy who one moment
###2392 is the president of a big construction company like Halliburton
###2396 and the next moment he's Vice President of the United States
###2398 or the President who was in the oil business. And this is true
###2401 whether you get Democrats or Republicans in the office.
###2403 .
###2403 You have this moving back and forth through a revolving door.
###2407 And in a way, our government is invisible a lot of the time
###2412 and its' policies are carried out by our corporations
###2415 on one level or another. And then again
###2418 the policies of the government are basically
###2421 forged by the corporatocracy, and then presented to the government
###2425 .
###2425 and they become government policy. So, there's an incredibly
###2428 cozy relationship.
###2430 This isn't a conspiracy theory type of thing. These people don't have to
###2433 get together and plot to do things.
###2436 .
###2436 They all basically work under one primary assumption
###2439 and that is that they must maximize profits
###2442 .
###2442 regardless of the social and environmental costs.
###2450 -This process of manipulation by the corporatocracy
###2454 through the use of debt, bribery and political overthrow is called
###2458 Globalization
###2460 Just as the Federal Reserve keeps the American public in a position
###2464 of indentured servitude though perpetual debt, inflation and interest
###2469 the World Bank and IMF serve this role on a global scale.
###2473 The basic scam is simple.
###2475 Put a country in debt either by its own indiscretion
###2478 or through corrupting the leader of that country
###2481 then impose "conditionalities" or "structural adjustment policies"
###2486 often consisting of the following:
###2489 Currency devaluation.
###2491 When the value of a currency drops, so does everything valued in it.
###2495 This makes indigenous resources available to predator countries
###2499 at a fraction of their worth.
###2502 Large funding cuts for social programs.
###2505 These usually include education and healthcare
###2508 compromising the well-being and integrity of the society
###2511 leaving the public vulnerable to exploitation.
###2514 Privatization of state-owned enterprises.
###2517 This means that socially important systems
###2520 can be purchased and regulated by foreign corporations for profit.
###2524 For example, in 1999, the World Bank insisted
###2528 that the Bolivian government sell
###2530 the public water-system of its third-largest city
###2533 to a subsidiary of the US corporation "Bechtel."
###2536 As soon as this occurred, water bills
###2538 for the already impoverished local residents, skyrocketed.
###2542 It wasn't until after a full-blown revolt by the people
###2546 that the Bechtel contract was nullified.
###2551 Then there is trade liberalization
###2554 or the opening up of the economy
###2556 through removing any restrictions on foreign trade.
###2559 This allows for a number of abusive economic manifestations
###2563 such as transnational corporations
###2565 bringing in their own mass-produced products
###2568 undercutting the indigenous production and ruining local economies.
###2572 An example is Jamaica;
###2575 which, after accepting loans and conditionalities from the World Bank
###2579 lost its largest cash crop markets
###2581 due to competition with Western imports.
###2584 Today, countless farmers are out of work for they're unable to compete
###2588 with the large corporations.
###2591 Another variation is the creation of numerous
###2594 seemingly unnoticed, unregulated, inhumane sweatshop-factories
###2600 which take advantage of the imposed economic hardship.
###2604 Additionally, due to production deregulation
###2607 environmental destruction is perpetual, as a country's resources
###2611 are often exploited by the indifferent corporations
###2613 while outputting large amounts of deliberate pollution.
###2618 -The largest environmental lawsuit in the history of the world
###2621 today is being brought on behalf of
###2623 30,000 Ecuadorian and Amazonian people
###2626 against Texaco, which is now owned by Chevron;
###2630 so it's against Chevron, but for activities conducted by Texaco.
###2634 They're estimated to be more than 18 times
###2636 what the Exxon Valdez dumped into the Coast of Alaska.
###2640 In the case of Ecuador it wasn't an accident.
###2643 The oil companies did it intentionally. They knew they were doing it
###2646 to save money rather than arranging for proper disposal.
###2652 -Furthermore, a cursory glance
###2653 at the performance record of the World Bank
###2656 reveals that the institution, which publicly claims to
###2658 help poor countries develop and alleviate poverty
###2662 has done nothing but increase poverty and the wealth-gap
###2665 while corporate profits soar.
###2667 In 1960, the income-gap between the
###2670 fifth of the world's people in the richest countries
###2673 versus the fifth in the poorest countries was thirty to one.
###2677 By 1998, it was seventy-four to one.
###2681 While global GNP rose 40% between 1970 and 1985
###2687 those in poverty actually increased by 17%.
###2691 While from 1985 to 2000
###2693 those living on less than one dollar a day increased by 18%.
###2700 Even the Joint Economic Committee of the U.S. Congress
###2704 admitted that there is a mere 40% success rate
###2707 of all World Bank projects.
###2709 In the late 1960's, the World Bank
###2712 intervened in Ecuador with large loans.
###2715 During the next 30 years, poverty grew from 50% to 70%.
###2719 Under or unemployment grew from 15% to 70%.
###2724 Public debt increased from 240 million to 16 billion
###2729 while the share of resources allocated to the poor
###2732 went from 20% to 6%.
###2736 In fact, by the year 2000, 50% of Ecuador's national budget
###2741 had to be allocated for paying its debts.
###2747 It is important to understand: The World Bank is, in fact
###2750 a U.S. bank, supporting U. S. interests.
###2754 For the United States holds veto-power over decisions
###2757 as it is the largest provider of capital.
###2760 And where did it get this money?
###2762 You guessed it. It made it out of thin air
###2764 through the fractional reserve banking system.
###2769 Of the world's top 100 economies, as based on annual GDP
###2774 51 are corporations and 47 of that 51 are U.S.-based.
###2779 Walmart, General Motors and Exxon are more economically powerful
###2784 than Saudi Arabia, Poland, Norway, South Africa
###2789 Finland, Indonesia and many others.
###2792 And, as protective trade barriers are broken down
###2796 currencies tossed together and manipulated in floating markets
###2799 and State economies overturned in favor of open competition
###2804 in global capitalism, the empire expands.
###2809 -You get up on your little 21-inch screen
###2815 and howl about America and democracy.
###2820 There is no America, there is no democracy.
###2825 There is only IBM, and ITT, and AT&T
###2830 and Dupont, Dow, Union Carbide, and Exxon.
###2836 Those are the nations of the world today.
###2840 What do you think the Russians talk about in their councils of state?
###2843 Karl Marx?
###2844 They get out their linear programming charts
###2847 statistical decision theories, min and max solutions
###2849 and compute the price-cost probabilities
###2851 of their transactions and investments, just like we do.
###2855 We no longer live in a world of nations and ideologies, Mr. Beale.
###2859 The world is a college of corporations
###2865 inexorably determined by the immutable by-laws of business.
###2873 The world is a business, Mr. Beale.
###2878 "Taken cumulatively, the integration of the world as a whole
###2882 particularly in terms of economic globalization
###2885 and the mythic qualities of "free market" capitalism
###2887 represents a veritable "empire" in its own right.
###2890 Few have been able to escape the "structural adjustment" and
###2892 .
###2893 "conditionalities" of the W. B, the IMF, or the WTO
###2895 those international financial institutions that, however inadequate
###2898 still determine what economic globalization means.
###2900 Such is the power of globalization that, within our lifetime, we are likely to see
###2903 the integration, even if unevenly, of all national economies in the world
###2906 .
###2906 into a single global, free market system."
###2908 -The World is being taken over by a handful of business powers
###2912 who dominate the natural resources we need to live
###2915 while controlling the money we need to obtain these resources.
###2918 The end result will be world monopoly
###2922 based not on human life but financial and corporate power.
###2927 And, as the inequality grows, naturally
###2930 more and more people are becoming desperate.
###2933 So the establishment was forced to come up with a new way
###2936 to deal with anyone who challenges the system.
###2940 So they gave birth to the "Terrorist."
###2943 The term "terrorist" is an empty distinction
###2946 designed for any person or group
###2949 who chooses to challenge the establishment.
###2951 This isn't to be confused with the fictional "Al Qaida"
###2955 which was actually the name of a computer database
###2958 of the U.S. -supported Mujahideen in the 1980's.
###2962 "The truth is, there is no Islamic army or terrorist group
###2964 called Al Qaida. And any informed intelligence officer knows this.
###2967 But there is a propaganda campaign to make the public believe
###2969 in the presence of an identified entity... The country behind this propaganda is the U.S."
###2971 - Pierre-Henri Bunel, Former French Military Intelligence
###2973 In 2007
###2975 the Department of Defense received 161.8 billion dollars
###2980 for the so-called global war on terrorism.
###2983 According to the national counter-terrorism center
###2986 in 2004 roughly 2000 people were killed internationally
###2990 due to supposed terrorist acts.
###2993 Of that number, 70 were American.
###2996 Using this number as a general average, which is extremely generous
###3000 it is interesting to note that twice as many people die
###3004 from peanut allergies a year than from terrorist acts.
###3009 Concurrently, the leading cause of death in America
###3012 is coronary heart disease, killing roughly 450,000 each year.
###3018 And in 2007, the government's allocation of funds for research
###3022 on this issue was about three billion dollars.
###3025 This means that the US government, in 2007
###3029 spent 54 times the amount for preventing terrorism
###3033 than it spent for preventing a disease
###3036 which kills 6600 times more people annually, than terrorism does.
###3045 Yet, as the name terrorism and Al Qaida are arbitrarily stamped
###3050 on every news report relating to any action taken against US interests
###3054 the myth grows wider.
###3056 In mid 2008, the US Attorney General actually proposed
###3060 that the US Congress officially declare war against the fantasy.
###3066 .
###3066 Not to mention, as of July 2008, there are now over 1 million people
###3071 currently on the US terrorist watch list.
###3076 These so called "Counter-Terrorism Measures"
###3079 of course, have nothing to do with social protection
###3082 and everything to do with preserving the establishment
###3085 amongst the growing anti-American sentiment
###3088 both domestically and internationally
###3091 which is legitimately founded on
###3093 the greed-based corporate empire expansion
###3096 that is exploiting the world.
###3100 The true terrorists of our world, do not meet at the docks at midnight
###3105 or scream "Allah Akbar" before some violent action.
###3109 The true terrorists of our world wear 5000 dollar suits
###3114 and work in the highest positions of finance, government and business.
###3122 So, what do we do?
###3125 How do we stop a system of greed and corruption
###3127 that has so much power and momentum?
###3129 How do we stop this aberrant group behavior, which feels no compassion
###3134 for say, the millions slaughtered in Iraq and Afghanistan
###3138 so the corporatocracy can control
###3140 energy resources and opium production for Wall St. profit?
###3147 Before 1980, Afghanistan produced 0% of the world's opium.
###3152 After the US/CIA backed Mujahideen won the Soviet/Afghan war
###3155 by 1986 they were producing 40% of the world's heroin supply.
###3158 By 1988, they were producing 80% of the total market supply.
###3164 But then, something unexpected happened.
###3168 The Taliban rose to power and by 2000, they had destroyed most of the opium fields.
###3173 Production dropped from 3000+ tons to only 185 tons, a 94% reduction.
###3177 On Sept. 9th 2001, the full Afghanistan invasion plans were on President Bush's Desk.
###3182 Two days later they had their excuse.
###3188 Today, opium productions in US controlled Afghanistan
###3191 which now provides more than 90% of the world's heroin
###3194 breaks new production records nearly every year.
###3197 How do we stop a system of greed and corruption
###3199 that condemns poor populations to "Sweatshop-Slavery"
###3203 for the benefit of Madison Avenue?
###3205 Or that engineers false-flag terror attacks
###3209 for the sake of manipulation?
###3211 Or that generates built-in modes of social operation
###3215 which are inherently exploitative?
###3217 Or that systematically reduces civil liberties
###3221 and violates human rights
###3223 in order to protect itself from its own shortcomings.
###3227 How do we deal with the numerous covert institutions
###3230 such as the Council on Foreign Relations
###3232 the Trilateral Commission and the Bilderberg Group
###3235 and other undemocratically elected groups
###3237 which, behind closed doors collude to control the political
###3242 financial, social and environmental elements of our lives?
###3247 In order to find the answer, we must first find
###3250 the true underlying cause.
###3253 For the fact is:
###3255 The selfish, corrupt power and profit- based groups
###3259 are not the true source of the problem.
###3262 They are symptoms.
###3265 "Greed and Competition are not the result of immutable human temperament...
###3270 ...greed and fear of scarcity are in fact being created and amplified...
###3274 the direct consequence is that we have to fight with each other in order to survive.
###3279 - Bernard Liertaer - Founder of the EU Currency System
###3281 -My name is Jacque Fresco.
###3284 I'm an industrial designer and a social engineer.
###3288 I'm very much interested in society
###3292 and developing a system that might be sustainable, for all people.
###3298 First of all, the word "corruption" is a monetary invention
###3302 that aberrant behavior
###3304 behavior that's disruptive to the well-being of people.
###3308 Well you're dealing with human behavior.
###3312 And human behavior appears to be environmentally determined.
###3316 Meaning, if you were raised by the Seminole Indians as a baby
###3321 never saw anything else, you'd hold that value system.
###3325 And this goes for nations, it goes for individuals, for families.
###3330 They try to indoctrinate their children to their particular faith
###3334 and their country and make them feel like they're part of that.
###3339 And they build a society, which they call established.
###3344 They established a workable point of view and tend to perpetuate that.
###3349 Whereas, all societies are really emergent, not established.
###3354 And so they fight new ideas
###3358 that would interfere with the establishment.
###3361 Governments try to perpetuate that which keeps them in power.
###3366 People are not elected to political office to change things.
###3371 They are put there to keep things the way they are.
###3375 So you see, the basis of corruption is in our society.
###3380 Let me make it clear. All nations then are basically corrupt
###3384 because they tend to uphold existing institutions.
###3388 I don't mean to uphold or downgrade all nations
###3392 but communism, socialism, fascism, the free enterprise-system
###3396 and all other sub-cultures are the same.
###3400 They are all basically corrupt.
###3405 -The most fundamental characteristic of our social institutions
###3408 is the necessity for self-preservation.
###3411 Whether dealing with a corporation, a religion or a government
###3415 the foremost interest is to preserve the institution itself.
###3419 For instance, the last thing an oil company would ever want
###3422 is the utilization of energy that was outside of its control.
###3426 For it makes that company less relevant to society.
###3430 Likewise the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union
###3433 was, in reality, a way to preserve and perpetuate
###3437 the established economic and global hegemony of the United States.
###3443 Similarly, religions condition people
###3445 to feel guilty for natural inclinations
###3448 each claiming to offer the only path to forgiveness and salvation.
###3453 At the heart of this institutional self-preservation
###3456 lies the monetary system
###3458 for it is money that provides the means for power and survival.
###3463 Therefore, just as a poor person
###3465 might be forced to steal in order to survive
###3467 it is a natural inclination to do whatever is needed
###3470 to continue an institution's profitability.
###3473 This makes it inherently difficult
###3475 for profit-based institutions to change, for it puts in jeopardy
###3480 not only the survival of large groups of people
###3482 but also the coveted materialistic lifestyles
###3485 associated with affluence and power.
###3489 Therefore, the paralyzing necessity to preserve an institution
###3492 regardless of its social relevance
###3495 is largely rooted in the need for money or profit.
###3501 [ Industry ]
###3503 - "What's in it for me? " is the way people think.
###3508 And so if a man makes money selling a certain product
###3511 that's where he's going to fight the existence of another product
###3515 that may threaten his institution.
###3519 Therefore, people cannot be fair.
###3523 And people do not trust each other.
###3525 A guy will come over to you and say
###3527 "I've got just the house you're looking for. " He's a salesman.
###3530 When a doctor says, "I think your kidney has to come out."
###3533 I don't know if he's trying to pay off a yacht
###3536 or that my kidney has to come out.
###3538 It's hard in a monetary system to trust people.
###3543 If you came into my store and I said, "This lamp that I've got
###3546 is pretty good, but the lamp next door is much better."
###3550 I wouldn't be in business very long. It wouldn't work.
###3553 If I were ethical, it wouldn't work.
###3556 So when you say industry cares for people, that's not true.
###3561 They can't afford to be ethical.
###3564 So your system is not designed to serve the well-being of people.
###3568 If you still don't understand that there would be no outsourcing of jobs
###3573 if they cared about people.
###3575 Industry does not care. They only hire people
###3578 because it hasn't been automated yet.
###3582 So don't talk about decency and ethics.
###3585 We cannot afford it and remain in business.
###3589 -It is important to point out that regardless of the social system -
###3593 whether fascist, socialist, capitalist or communist
###3597 the underlying mechanism is still money, labor and competition.
###3603 Communist China is no less capitalistic than the United States.
###3607 The only difference is the degree
###3609 by which the state intervenes in enterprise.
###3613 The reality is that "Monetary-ism", so to speak
###3616 is the true mechanism that guides the interests
###3619 of all the countries on the planet.
###3622 The most aggressive and hence dominant variation
###3624 of this monetary-ism is the free enterprise system.
###3628 The fundamental perspective, as put forth
###3630 by early free market economists like Adam Smith
###3634 is that self interest and competition leads to social prosperity
###3638 as the act of competition creates incentive
###3641 which motivates people to persevere.
###3645 However, what isn't talked about, is how a competition based economy
###3649 invariably leads to strategic corruption
###3652 power and wealth consolidation, social stratification
###3656 technological paralysis, labor abuse and ultimately a covert form
###3662 of government dictatorship by the rich elite.
###3667 The word "corruption" is often defined as moral perversion.
###3672 If a company dumps toxic waste into the ocean to save money
###3675 most people recognize this as "corrupt behavior".
###3679 On a more subtle level, when Walmart moves into a small town
###3683 and forces small businesses to shut down
###3686 for they are unable to compete, a grey area emerges.
###3690 For what exactly is Walmart doing wrong?
###3693 Why should they care about the Mom and Pop organizations they destroy?
###3697 Yet, even more subtly, when a person gets fired from their job
###3701 because a new machine has been created
###3704 which can do the work for less money
###3706 people tend to just accept that as "the way it is"
###3709 .
###3709 not seeing the inherent corrupt inhumanity of such an action.
###3715 Because the fact is, whether it is dumping toxic waste
###3719 having a monopoly enterprise or downsizing the workforce
###3723 the motive is the same: Profit.
###3726 .
###3726 They are all different degrees of the same self-preserving mechanism
###3731 which always puts the well-being of people second to monetary gain.
###3736 Therefore, corruption is not some byproduct of monetary-ism
###3741 it is the very foundation.
###3744 And while most people acknowledge this tendency
###3747 on one level or another, the majority remains naive
###3750 as to the broad ramifications
###3752 of having such a selfish mechanism
###3755 as the guiding mentality in society.
###3758 -Internal documents show
###3760 that after this company positively absolutely knew
###3763 that they had a medication that was infected with the AIDS virus
###3766 they took the product off the market in the US
###3769 and then they dumped it in France, Europe, Asia and Latin America.
###3772 The US government allowed it to happen.
###3774 The FDA allowed this to happen
###3777 and now the government is completely looking the other way.
###3779 Thousands of innocent hemophiliacs have died from the AIDS virus.
###3784 This company knew absolutely that it was infected with AIDS,
###3788 they dumped it because they wanted to turn this disaster into a profit.
###3795 -So you see, you have built-in corruption.
###3799 We're all chiseling off each other
###3801 and you can't expect decency or that sort of thing.
###3806 Politics
###3808 ...a feeling that they don't know who to elect.
###3812 They think in terms of a democracy
###3814 which is not possible in a monetary based economy.
###3819 If you have more money to advertise your position
###3822 the position you desire in government, that isn't a democracy.
###3826 .
###3826 It serves those in positions of differential advantage.
###3831 So it's always a dictatorship of the elitist, the financially wealthy.
###3836 .
###3836 "We can either have democracy in this country or
###3839 we can have great wealth concentrated in the hands of a few,
###3842 but we can't have both." - Louis Brandeis - Supreme Court Justice
###3844 -It is an interesting observation
###3846 to note how seemingly unknown personalities
###3849 magically appear on the scene as presidential candidates.
###3853 Then before you know it, somehow you are left to choose
###3856 from a small group of extremely wealthy people
###3859 who suspiciously have the same broad social view.
###3864 Obviously it's a joke.
###3866 The people placed on the ballot are done so
###3868 because they have been pre-decided to be acceptable
###3872 by the established financial powers who actually run the show.
###3877 Yet many who understand this illusion of democracy, often think
###3881 "If only we could just get our honest, ethical politicians in power,
###3886 then we would be okay".
###3888 Well, while this idea, of course, seems reasonable
###3891 in our established oriented world view
###3895 it is unfortunately another fallacy.
###3899 For when it really comes down to what is actually important,
###3903 the institution of politics and thus politicians themselves
###3907 have absolutely no true relevance as to
###3910 what makes our world and society function.
###3914 -It's not politicians that can solve problems.
###3918 They have no technical capabilities.
###3920 They don't know how to solve problems.
###3923 Even if they were sincere, they don't know how to solve problems.
###3927 It's the technicians that produce the desalinization plants.
###3932 It's the technicians that give you electricity.
###3934 That give you motor vehicles.
###3936 That heat your house and cool it in the summer time.
###3939 It's technology that solves problems, not politics.
###3943 Politics cannot solve problems 'cause they are not trained to do so.
###3949 -Very few people today stop and consider
###3952 what it is that actually improves their lives.
###3955 Is it money? Obviously not.
###3958 One cannot eat money or stuff money into their car to get it to run.
###3963 Is it politics?
###3965 All politicians can do is create laws
###3968 establish budgets and declare war.
###3971 Is it religion? Of course not.
###3973 Religion creates nothing except
###3975 intangible emotional solace for those who require it.
###3979 The true gift that we as human beings have
###3983 which has been solely responsible for everything
###3986 that has improved our lives
###3989 is technology.
###3991 What is technology?
###3993 Technology is a pencil
###3995 which allows one to solidify ideas on paper for communication.
###3999 Technology is an automobile, which allows one to travel faster
###4003 than feet would allow.
###4004 Technology is a pair of eye glasses
###4007 which enables sight for those who need it.
###4010 Applied technology itself is merely an extension of human attributes
###4016 which reduces human effort
###4018 freeing humans from a particular chore or problem.
###4021 Imagine what your life would be like today
###4024 without a telephone, or an oven
###4026 or a computer, or an airplane.
###4029 .
###4029 And, everything in your home, which you take for granted
###4032 from a doorbell, to a table
###4034 to a dishwasher, is technology
###4037 generated from the creative scientific ingenuity of human technicians.
###4043 Not money, politics or religion.
###4046 These are false institutions.
###4050 - ...and writing your congressman is fantastic.
###4053 They tell you to write your congressman if you want something done.
###4056 The men in Washington should be at the forefront of technology.
###4060 The forefront of human study.
###4062 The forefront of crime.
###4064 All the factors that shape human behavior.
###4067 You don't have to write your congressman.
###4069 What kind of people are they that are appointed to do that job?
###4074 The future will have great difficulty...
###4077 and the question that's raised by politicians is:
###4080 How much will a project cost?
###4083 The question is not "how much will it cost".
###4086 Do we have the resources?
###4088 And we have the resources today to house everyone,
###4092 build hospitals all over the world,
###4095 build schools all over the world
###4097 the finest equipment in labs for teaching and doing medical research.
###4102 So you see, we have all that, but we're in a monetary system
###4107 and in a monetary system there's profit.
###4112 -And what is the fundamental mechanism that drives the profit system
###4115 besides self-interest?
###4117 What is it exactly that maintains that competitive edge at its core?
###4121 Is it high efficiency and sustainability?
###4125 No. That isn't part of their design.
###4128 Nothing produced in our profit based society
###4131 is even remotely sustainable or efficient.
###4133 If it was, there wouldn't be a multi-million dollar a year
###4136 service industry for automobiles.
###4138 Nor would the average lifespan for most electronics
###4141 be less than three months before they're obsolete.
###4145 Is it abundance?
###4147 Absolutely not.
###4149 Abundance, as based on the laws of supply and demand
###4151 is actually a negative thing.
###4154 If a diamond company finds
###4155 ten times the usual amount of diamonds during their mining
###4159 it means the supply of diamonds has increased
###4161 which means the cost and profit per diamond drops.
###4165 The fact is: efficiency, sustainability and abundance
###4169 are enemies of profit.
###4171 To put it into a word
###4173 it is the mechanism of scarcity that increases profits.
###4181 -What is scarcity?
###4182 Based on keeping products valuable.
###4185 Slowing up production on oil raises the price.
###4188 Maintaining scarcity of diamonds keeps the price high.
###4192 They burn diamonds at the Kimberly Diamond Mine.
###4196 They are made of carbon. That keeps the price up.
###4199 -So then, what does it mean for society when scarcity
###4203 either produced naturally or through manipulation
###4206 is a beneficial condition for industry?
###4211 It means that sustainability and abundance
###4214 will never ever occur in a profit system
###4217 for it simply goes against the very nature of the structure.
###4221 Therefore, it is impossible to have a world without war or poverty.
###4228 It is impossible to continually advance technology
###4231 to its most efficient and productive states.
###4235 And, most dramatically
###4237 it is impossible to expect human beings
###4240 to behave in truly ethical or decent ways.
###4245 "Human nature
###4247 or human behavior? "
###4250 -People use the word instinct
###4253 because they can't account for the behavior.
###4257 They sit back and they evaluate
###4259 with their lack of knowledge, you know
###4262 and they say things like
###4265 "Humans are built a certain way. Greed is a natural thing"
###4268 as though they'd worked for years on it.
###4270 And it's no more natural than wearing clothing.
###4274 -What we want to do is to eliminate
###4277 the causes of the problems.
###4279 Eliminate the processes
###4282 that produce greed and bigotry and prejudice
###4286 and people taking advantage of one another and elitism
###4291 eliminating the need for prisons and welfare.
###4295 We have always had these problems
###4297 because we have always lived within scarcity and barter
###4301 and monetary systems that produce scarcity.
###4305 -If you eradicate the conditions that generate
###4309 what you call socially offensive behavior, it does not exist.
###4313 .
###4313 A guy says: "Well, isn't that in-born? " No it's not.
###4317 .
###4318 -There is no human nature; there's human behavior,
###4321 and that's always been changed throughout history.
###4324 You're not born with bigotry and greed and corruption and hatred.
###4329 You pick that up within the society.
###4333 -War, poverty, corruption, hunger, misery, human suffering
###4338 will not change in a monetary system;
###4340 that is, there will be very little significant change.
###4344 It's going to take the redesign of our culture, our values
###4348 .
###4348 and it has to be related to the carrying capacity of the earth
###4352 not some human opinion or some politicians notions
###4357 of the way the world ought to be
###4359 or some religious notion of the conduct of human affairs.
###4365 And that's what The Venus Project is about.
###4370 The society that we're about to talk about
###4373 is a society that is free of all the old superstitions
###4378 incarceration, prisons, police, cruelty and law.
###4383 All laws will disappear
###4385 and the professions will disappear, that are no longer valid
###4389 such as stockbrokers, bankers, advertising.
###4393 Gone! Forever!
###4395 Because it's no longer relevant.
###4400 -When we understand that it is technology
###4403 devised by human ingenuity
###4404 which frees humanity and increases our quality of life
###4408 we then realize that the most important focus we can have
###4412 is on the intelligent management of the earth's resources.
###4416 For it is from these natural resources we gain the materials
###4419 to continue our path of prosperity. Understanding this we then see
###4424 that money fundamentally exists as a barrier to these resources
###4429 for virtually everything has a financial cost.
###4432 And why do we need money to obtain these resources?
###4435 Because of real or assumed scarcity.
###4440 We don't usually pay for air and tap water
###4443 because it is in such high abundance,
###4445 selling it would be pointless.
###4448 So then, logically speaking, if resources
###4451 and technologies applicable to creating everything in our societies
###4455 such as houses, cities and transportation, were in high enough
###4459 abundance, there would be no reason to sell anything.
###4464 Likewise, if automation and machinery was so technologically advanced
###4468 as to relieve human beings of labor,
###4471 there would be no reason to have a job.
###4473 And with these social aspects taken care of,
###4476 there would be no reason to have money at all.
###4480 So the ultimate question remains:
###4482 Do we on Earth have enough resources
###4485 and technological understanding
###4487 to create a society of such abundance
###4490 that everything we have now could be available without a price tag
###4494 and without the need for submission through employment?
###4498 Yes, we do.
###4501 We have the resources and technology to enable this at a minimum
###4505 .
###4505 along with the ability to raise the standards of living so high
###4509 that people in the future will look back at our civilization now
###4513 and gawk at how primitive and immature our society was.
###4518 -What The Venus Project proposes is an entirely different system
###4523 .
###4523 that's updated to present day knowledge.
###4526 -We've never given scientists the problem of
###4529 how do you design a society which would
###4531 eliminate boring and monotonous jobs
###4534 that would eliminate accidents in transportation
###4538 that would enable people to have a high standard of living
###4541 that would eliminate poisons in our food
###4544 give us other sources of energy that are clean and efficient.
###4548 We can do that out there.
###4551 [A resource-based economy.]
###4556 The major difference between a
###4557 Resource-Based Economy (RBE) and a monetary system
###4560 is that a RBE is really concerned with people and their well-being,
###4565 .
###4565 where the monetary system has become so distorted that the
###4569 concerns of the people are really secondary, if they're there at all.
###4573 The products that are turned out are for how much money you can get.
###4578 If there is a problem in society and
###4580 you can't earn money from solving that problem, then it won't be done.
###4584 The Resource-Based Economy is really
###4587 not close to anything that's been tried.
###4589 And with all our technology today we can create abundance.
###4592 It could be used to improve everyone's lifestyle
###4595 abundance all over the world if we use our technology wisely
###4598 and maintain the environment.
###4600 -It's a very different system and it's very hard to talk about
###4604 .
###4604 because the public is not that well enough informed
###4608 as to the state of technology.
###4611 [Energy]
###4615 At present, we don't have to burn fossil fuels.
###4619 We don't have to use anything that would contaminate the environment.
###4623 There are many sources of energy available.
###4627 -Alternative energy solutions pushed by the establishment
###4631 such as hydrogen, biomass and even nuclear
###4634 are highly insufficient, dangerous and exist only
###4637 to perpetuate the profit-structure that industry has created.
###4641 When we look beyond the propaganda and self-serving solutions
###4644 put forth by the energy companies
###4647 we find a seemingly endless stream
###4649 of clean, abundant and renewable energy for generating power.
###4654 Solar and wind energy are well known to the public
###4657 but the true potential of these mediums remains unexpressed.
###4661 Solar energy, derived from the sun
###4663 has such abundance that one hour of light at high noon
###4667 contains more energy than what the entire world consumes in a year.
###4671 If we could capture 1/100th of a percent of this energy
###4675 the world would never have to use oil, gas or anything else.
###4679 The question then, is not availability
###4682 but the technology to harness it.
###4684 And there are many advanced mediums today
###4686 which could accomplish just that
###4689 if they were not hindered by the need to compete for market share
###4693 with the established energy power structures.
###4696 Then there's wind energy.
###4698 Wind energy has long been denounced as weak
###4701 and due to being location driven impractical.
###4705 This is simply not true.
###4706 The US Department of Energy admitted in 2007
###4710 that if wind was fully harvested in just three of America's 50 states
###4715 it could power the entire nation.
###4718 And then there are the rather unknown mediums
###4721 of tidal and wave power.
###4723 Tidal power is derived from tidal shifts in the ocean.
###4727 Installing turbines which capture this movement generates energy.
###4731 In the United Kingdom, 42 sites are currently noted as available
###4735 forecasting that 34% of all the UK's energy
###4739 could come from tidal power alone.
###4743 Wave power, which extracts energy
###4745 from the surface motions of the ocean
###4747 is estimated to have a global potential
###4750 of up to 80,000 terawatt-hours a year.
###4753 This means 50% of the entire planet's energy usage
###4757 could be produced from this medium alone.
###4761 Now, it is important to point out that
###4763 tidal, wave, solar and wind power
###4766 requires virtually no preliminary energy to harness
###4770 unlike coal, oil, gas, biomass, hydrogen and all the others.
###4775 In combination, these four mediums alone
###4778 if efficiently harnessed through technology
###4780 could power the world forever.
###4784 That being said, there happens to be another form
###4787 of clean renewable energy, which trumps them all.
###4790 Geothermal power.
###4793 Geothermal energy utilizes what is called "heat mining"
###4796 which, through a simple process using water
###4799 is able to generate massive amounts of clean energy.
###4802 In 2006, an MIT report on geothermal energy
###4806 found that 13,000 ZJ of power are currently available in the earth
###4811 with the possibility of 2,000 ZJ being easily tappable
###4815 with improved technology.
###4817 The total energy consumption of all the countries on the planet
###4821 is about half of a ZJ a year.
###4823 This means about 4000 years of planetary power
###4827 could be harnessed in this medium alone.
###4830 And when we understand that the earth's heat generation
###4832 is constantly renewed, this energy is really limitless.
###4836 It could be used forever.
###4839 These energy sources are only a few
###4842 of the clean renewable mediums available
###4844 and as time goes on, we will find more.
###4847 The grand realization is that we have total energy abundance
###4851 without the need for pollution
###4853 traditional conservation or, in fact, a price tag.
###4859 And what about transportation?
###4862 The prevailing means of transportation in our societies
###4865 is by automobile and aircraft
###4867 both of which predominantly need fossil fuels to run.
###4871 In the case of the automobile, the battery technology
###4874 needed to power an electric car
###4876 that can go over a hundred miles an hour
###4878 for over two hundred miles on one charge
###4880 exists and has existed for many years.
###4883 However, due to battery patents, controlled by the oil industry
###4886 which limits their availability to maintain market share
###4889 coupled with political pressure from the energy industry
###4892 the accessibility and affordability of this technology is limited.
###4897 There is absolutely no reason,
###4898 other than pure corrupt profit interests
###4901 that every single vehicle in the world
###4903 cannot be electric and utterly clean, with zero need for gasoline.
###4908 As far as airplanes, it is time we realize
###4911 that this means of travel is inefficient, cumbersome
###4914 slow, and causes far too much pollution.
###4917 This is a maglev train.
###4920 It uses magnets for propulsion.
###4922 It is fully suspended by a magnetic field
###4925 and requires less than 2% of the energy used for plane travel.
###4930 The train has no wheels, so nothing can wear out.
###4933 The current maximum speed of versions of this technology
###4937 as used in Japan, is three hundred and sixty one miles per hour.
###4941 However this version of the technology is very dated.
###4945 An organization called ET3
###4947 which has connections with The Venus Project
###4950 has established a tube-based maglev
###4953 that can travel up to 4000 miles per hour
###4956 in a motionless, frictionless tube
###4958 which can go over land or under water.
###4962 Imagine going from LA to New York for an extended lunch break
###4966 or from Washington D.C. to Beijing, China, in two hours.
###4970 This is the future of continental and intercontinental travel.
###4974 Fast, clean, with only a fraction of the energy usage
###4978 we use today for the same means.
###4981 In fact, between maglev technology
###4984 advanced battery storage and geothermal energy
###4987 there will be no reason to ever burn fossil fuels again.
###4991 And we can do this now
###4993 if we were not held back by the paralyzing profit structure.
###4997 [work]
###5000 -Now America is inclined toward fascism.
###5004 It has a propensity by its dominant philosophy and religion
###5009 to uphold the fascist point of view.
###5011 American industry is essentially a fascist institution.
###5016 If you don't understand that, the minute you punch that time clock
###5020 you walk into a dictatorship.
###5021 -We're given notions about the respectability of work.
###5026 And I really look at it as being paid slavery.
###5031 -You're brought up to believe that you shall earn your living
###5034 by the sweat of your brow. That holds people back.
###5038 Freeing people from drudgery
###5041 repetitive jobs which make them ignorant.
###5043 You rob them.
###5046 In our society, that is a resource- based economy
###5049 machines free people.
###5052 You see, we can't imagine that
###5054 because we've never known that kind of world.
###5057 [automation]
###5061 -If we look back at history
###5063 we see a very clear pattern of machine automation
###5066 slowly replacing human labor.
###5069 From the disappearance of the elevator man
###5072 to the near full automation of an automobile production plant
###5075 the fact is, as technology grows
###5078 the need for humans in the work force will continually be diminished.
###5082 .
###5082 This creates a serious clash
###5085 which proves the falseness of the monetary-based labor system
###5090 for human employment is in direct competition
###5093 with technological development.
###5096 Therefore, given the fundamental priority of profit by industry
###5100 people through time will be continually laid off
###5103 and replaced by machines.
###5106 -When industry takes on a machine
###5108 instead of shortening the work day, they downsize.
###5111 You lose your job so you have a right to fear machines.
###5115 -In a high technology, resource-based economy
###5119 it is conservative to say that about 90% of all current occupations
###5123 could be phased out by machines.
###5126 Freeing humans to live their life without servitude.
###5129 For this is the point of technology itself.
###5133 And through time, with nanotechnology
###5135 and other highly advanced forms of science
###5138 it is not far fetched to see how even complex medical procedures
###5143 could be performed by machines as well.
###5145 And based on the pattern, with much higher success rates
###5149 than humans get today.
###5151 The path is clear but our monetary-based structure
###5155 which requires labor for income, blocks this progress
###5159 for humans need jobs in order to survive.
###5163 The bottom line is that this system must go
###5165 or we will never be free
###5167 and technology will be constantly paralyzed.
###5171 -We have machines that clean out sewers
###5174 it frees a human being from doing that.
###5177 So look at machines as extensions of human performance.
###5183 -Furthermore, many occupations today
###5186 will have simply no basis to exist in a resource-based economy
###5191 such as anything associated with the management of money
###5194 advertising, along with the legal system itself.
###5198 For, without money, a great majority of the crimes
###5201 that are committed today would never occur.
###5204 Virtually all forms of crime are a consequence
###5206 of the monetary system, either directly or by neurosis
###5210 inflicted through financial deprivation.
###5214 Therefore, laws themselves could eventually become extinct.
###5218 -Instead of putting up a sign "Drive carefully
###5222 slippery when wet," put abrasive in the highway
###5225 so it is not slippery when wet.
###5227 And if a person gets in car, they're drunk
###5229 and the car oscillates a great deal
###5231 there's a little pendulum that swings up and back
###5234 and that will pull the car over to the side.
###5236 Not a law... solution.
###5239 .
###5239 Put sonar and radar on automobiles so they can't hit one another.
###5243 Man-made laws are attempts
###5245 to deal with occurring problems
###5248 and not knowing how to solve them
###5250 they make a law.
###5252 -In the United States, the most privatized
###5255 capitalist country on the planet, it should come as no surprise
###5259 that it also has the largest prison population in the world
###5263 growing every year.
###5265 Statistically, most of these people are uneducated
###5268 and come from poor, deprived societies.
###5271 And, contrary to propaganda, it is this environmental conditioning
###5276 which lures them into criminal and violent behavior.
###5279 However society looks the other way
###5282 in regard to this point.
###5284 The legal and prison systems are just more examples
###5288 of how our society avoids examining
###5290 the root causes of behaviour.
###5293 Billions are spent each year on prisons and police
###5296 .
###5296 while only a fraction is spent on programs for poverty
###5300 which is one of the most fundamental variables
###5303 responsible for crime to begin with.
###5305 And, as long as we have an economic system
###5308 which prefers and in fact creates
###5310 scarcity and deprivation, crime will never go away.
###5316 [incentive]
###5320 -If people have access to the necessities of life
###5325 without servitude, debt, barter, trade
###5331 they behave very differently.
###5332 You want all these things available without a price tag.
###5337 Now then, "you gotta have a price tag, what will motivate people?
###5342 A man gets everything he wants, he'd just lay around in the sun."
###5346 This is the myth they perpetuate.
###5349 People in our culture are trained to believe
###5352 that the monetary system produces incentive.
###5355 If they have access to things, why should they want to do anything?
###5359 They would lose their incentive.
###5360 That's what you're taught to support the monetary system.
###5364 -When you take money out of the scenario,
###5367 there would be different incentives, very different incentives.
###5371 -When people have access to the necessities of life,
###5375 their incentives change.
###5376 What about the moon and the stars?
###5379 New incentives arise.
###5381 If you make a painting that you enjoy
###5383 you will enjoy giving it to other people, not selling it.
###5388 [education]
###5392 -I think most of the education that I've seen today is essentially
###5396 producing a person for a job
###5398 It's very specialized. They're not generalists.
###5401 People don't know a lot about a lot of different subjects.
###5404 I don't think you could get people to go to war
###5407 if they knew a lot about a lot of things.
###5410 I think education is mostly rote
###5413 and they're not taught how to solve problems.
###5416 They're not given the tools, emotionally or within their own field
###5421 of how to do critical thinking.
###5423 In a resource-based economy, the education would be very different.
###5427 -Our society's major concern is mental development
###5431 and to motivate each person to their highest potential.
###5435 .
###5436 Because our philosophy is; the smarter people are, the richer the world
###5440 because everybody becomes a contributor.
###5443 The smarter your kids are, the better my life will be.
###5447 .
###5447 Because they'll be contributing more constructively
###5449 to the environment and to my life.
###5452 Because everything that we devise within a resource based economy
###5456 would be applied to society, there would be nothing to hold it back.
###5459 .
###5460 [civilization]
###5464 Patriotism, weapons, armies, navies
###5468 all that is a sign that we're not civilized yet.
###5473 .
###5473 Kids will ask their parents:
###5474 "Didn't you see the necessity of the machines?
###5479 Dad, couldn't you see that war was inevitable
###5482 when you produce scarcity? Isn't it obvious?
###5485 Of course, the kid will understand that you were pinheads,
###5488 .
###5488 raised merely to serve the established institutions.
###5492 We're such an abominable, sick society
###5495 that we won't make the history book.
###5497 They'll just say that large nations took land from smaller nations
###5501 used force and violence.
###5503 You'll get history talked about as corrupt behavior
###5507 all the way along until the beginning of the civilized world.
###5510 .
###5510 That's when all the nations work together.
###5513 World unification, working toward common good
###5517 for all human beings
###5519 and without anyone being subservient to anyone else.
###5524 Without social stratification, whether it be technical elitism
###5528 .
###5528 or any other kind of elitism, eradicated from the face of the Earth.
###5533 .
###5533 The "state" does nothing because there is no "state".
###5538 Because there is no state...
###5542 The system I advocate, a resource based global economy
###5546 is not perfect, it's just a lot better than what we have.
###5550 .
###5550 We can never achieve perfection.
###5561 "My country is the world... and my religion is to do good."
###5567 .
###5567 - Thomas Paine - 1737-1809
###5571 -The social values of our society
###5573 which has manifested in perpetual warfare, corruption
###5576 .
###5576 oppressive laws, social stratification, irrelevant superstitions
###5581 .
###5581 .
###5581 environmental destruction, and a despotic
###5584 socially indifferent, profit oriented ruling class
###5588 is fundamentally the result of a collective ignorance
###5591 of two of the most basic insights humans can have about reality.
###5596 The emergent and symbiotic aspects of natural law.
###5601 The emergent nature of reality is that all systems
###5605 whether it is knowledge, society, technology
###5609 philosophy or any other creation
###5612 will, when uninhibited, undergo fluid perpetual change.
###5617 .
###5617 What we consider commonplace today
###5619 such as modern communication and transportation
###5622 would have been unimaginable in ancient times.
###5626 Likewise, the future will contain technologies
###5629 realizations and social structures
###5631 that we cannot even fathom in the present.
###5634 We have gone from alchemy to chemistry
###5637 from a geocentric universe to a heliocentric
###5641 from believing that demons were the cause of illness
###5644 to modern medicine.
###5646 This development shows no sign of ending
###5649 and it is this awareness that aligns us and leads us
###5652 on a continuous path to growth and progress.
###5657 .
###5657 Static, empirical knowledge does not exist
###5660 rather it is the insight of the emergence of all systems
###5664 we must recognize.
###5666 This means we must be open to new information at all times
###5670 even if it threatens our current belief system
###5673 and hence, identities.
###5676 Sadly, society today has failed to recognize this
###5679 and the established institutions continue to paralyze growth
###5683 by preserving outdated social structures.
###5687 Simultaneously, the population suffers from a fear of change.
###5691 For their conditioning assumes a static identity
###5694 and challenging one's belief system
###5696 usually results in insult and apprehension.
###5699 For being wrong is erroneously associated with failure.
###5705 When in fact to be proven wrong should be celebrated.
###5709 For it is elevating someone to a new level of understanding,
###5713 furthering awareness.
###5715 The fact is, there is no such thing as a smart human being
###5719 for it is merely a matter of time
###5721 before their ideas are updated, changed or eradicated.
###5726 And this tendency to blindly hold on to a belief system,
###5730 sheltering it from new, possibly transforming information
###5734 is nothing less than a form of intellectual materialism.
###5739 The monetary system perpetuates this materialism
###5742 not only by its self-preserving structures
###5745 but also through the countless number of people
###5748 who have been conditioned into blindly
###5750 and thoughtlessly upholding these structures
###5752 therefore becoming self-appointed guardians of the status quo.
###5757 Sheep which no longer need a sheep-dog to control them.
###5761 For they control each other
###5764 by ostracizing those who step out of the norm.
###5767 This tendency to resist change and uphold existing institutions
###5771 .
###5771 for the sake of identity, comfort, power and profit
###5775 .
###5775 is completely unsustainable
###5778 and will only produce further imbalance
###5780 fragmentation, distortion, and invariably
###5783 .
###5783 .
###5783 destruction.
###5787 It's time to change.
###5790 From hunters and gatherers
###5792 to the agricultural revolution
###5794 to the industrial revolution
###5796 the pattern is clear.
###5797 It is time for a new social system
###5799 which reflects the understandings we have today.
###5804 The monetary system is a product of a period of time
###5807 .
###5807 where scarcity was a reality.
###5809 Now, with the age of technology, it is no longer relevant to society.
###5814 .
###5814 Gone with the aberrant behavior it manifests.
###5818 Likewise, dominant world views, such as theistic religion
###5823 operate with the same social irrelevancy.
###5826 .
###5826 Islam, Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism and all of the others
###5831 exist as barriers to personal and social growth.
###5835 For each group perpetuates a closed world view.
###5839 And this finite understanding that they acknowledge
###5842 is simply not possible in an emergent universe.
###5848 Yet, religion has succeeded in
###5851 shutting down the awareness of this emergence
###5853 by instilling the psychological distortion of faith upon its followers.
###5858 .
###5858 Where logic and new information is rejected
###5861 in favor of traditionalized outdated beliefs.
###5866 -The concept of God
###5868 is really a method of accounting for the nature of things.
###5872 In the early days people didn't know enough
###5875 about how things formed,
###5876 how nature worked.
###5878 So they invented their own little stories
###5881 and they made god in their own image.
###5886 A guy that gets angry
###5888 when people don't behave right, he creates floods and earthquakes
###5892 .
###5893 and they say it's an act of God.
###5896 -A cursory glance at the suppressed history of religion
###5899 reveals that even the foundational myths themselves
###5902 are emergent culminations developed through influence over time.
###5907 For example, a cardinal doctrine of the Christian faith
###5910 is the death and resurrection of Christ.
###5912 This notion is so important that the Bible itself states
###5916 'And if Christ be not risen
###5918 then is our preaching vain and your faith is also vain'.
###5924 Yet it is very difficult to take this account literally
###5927 for not only is there no primary source
###5930 denoting this supernatural event in secular history
###5933 awareness of the enormous number of pre-Christian saviors
###5936 who also died and were resurrected
###5939 immediately puts this story in mythological territory by association.
###5944 Early church figures, such as Tertullian
###5947 .
###5947 went to great lengths to break these associations
###5950 even claiming that the devil caused the similarities to occur.
###5955 Stating in the second century:
###5956 "The devil, whose business is to pervert the truth
###5959 mimics the exact circumstance of the Divine Sacraments.
###5962 He baptizes his believers and promises forgiveness of sins
###5966 he celebrates the oblation of bread
###5969 and brings in the symbol of the resurrection.
###5971 Let us therefore acknowledge the craftiness of the devil
###5975 who copied certain things of those that be Divine."
###5979 What is truly sad however
###5981 is that when we cease the idea that the stories from Christianity
###5985 Judaism, Islam and all the others
###5987 are literal history
###5990 and accept them for what they really are
###5992 which are purely allegorical expressions derived from many faiths
###5997 we see that all religions share a common thread.
###6001 And it is this unifying imperative
###6003 that needs to be recognized and appreciated.
###6008 Religious belief has caused more fragmentation and conflict
###6012 than any other ideology.
###6014 Christianity alone has 34,000 different subgroups.
###6020 -The Bible is subject to interpretation.
###6023 When you read it, you say
###6025 "I think Jesus meant this. I think Job meant that.
###6028 Oh No! He meant this."
###6030 So you have the Lutheran, the Seventh-day Adventist, the Catholic
###6035 and a church divided is no church at all.
###6038 And a church divided, is no church at all.
###6045 And this point on division
###6047 which is a trademark of all theistic religions,
###6051 brings us to our second failure of awareness.
###6054 The false assumption of separation
###6056 through the rejection of the symbiotic relationship of life.
###6062 Apart from the understanding that all natural systems are emergent
###6066 where all notions of reality will be constantly developed
###6069 altered and even eradicated
###6072 we must also understand that all systems are, in fact
###6075 invented fragments, merely for the sake of conversation.
###6080 For there is no such thing as independence in nature.
###6084 The whole of nature is a unified system of interdependent variables
###6089 each a cause and a reaction, existing only as a concentrated whole.
###6096 -You don't see the plug connected to the environment
###6099 so it looks like we're free, wandering around.
###6102 Take the oxygen away, we all die immediately.
###6105 Take plant life away, we die.
###6108 And without the sun, all the plants die.
###6110 So we are connected.
###6112 -We really must take into account the totality.
###6115 This isn't just a human experience on this planet,
###6118 this is a total experience.
###6119 And we know we can't survive without plants and animals.
###6121 We know we can't survive without the four elements, you know?
###6124 And so, when are we gonna really start taking that into account?
###6128 That's what it is to be successful.
###6130 Success depends on how well we relate to everything around us.
###6135 I'm very aware of the fact that my grandson
###6137 cannot possibly hope to inherit a sustainable
###6142 .
###6142 peaceful, stable, socially just world
###6144 unless every child today growing up in
###6146 Ethiopia, in Indonesia, in Bolivia, in Palestine, in Israel
###6151 also has that same expectation.
###6154 You've got to take care of the whole community
###6156 or you're gonna have serious problems.
###6158 And now we have to see that the whole world is the community.
###6162 And we must all take care of each other that way.
###6166 And it's not just a community of human beings
###6168 it's a community of plants and animals and elements.
###6171 And we really need to understand that.
###6174 That's what's gonna bring us joy too, and pleasure.
###6176 .
###6176 That's what's missing in our lives right now.
###6179 We can call it spirituality, but the fact of the matter is
###6182 .
###6182 joy comes from that bliss of connectedness.
###6186 That's our god spirit, that's that side of ourselves
###6189 that really feels it, and you can feel it deep inside you.
###6193 It's this amazing wonderful feeling, and you know it when you get it.
###6196 .
###6196 .
###6196 You don't get it from money, you get it from connection.
###6202 .
###6202 -Now if that isn't a hazard to this country.
###6206 How are we gonna keep building nuclear weapons
###6208 you know what I mean?
###6211 What's gonna happen to the arms industry
###6213 when we realize we're all one?
###6216 It's gonna fuck up the economy.
###6218 The economy that's fake anyway.
###6229 Which would be a real bummer.
###6231 You can see why the government's crackin' down...
###6237 ...on the idea of experiencing unconditional love."
###6241 "I believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love
###6243 will have the final word in reality."
###6247 - Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. - 1929-1968
###6251 -Once we understand that the integrity of our personal existences
###6255 are completely dependent on the integrity
###6257 of everything else in our world
###6260 we have truly understood the meaning of unconditional love.
###6265 For love is extensionality and seeing everything as you
###6269 and you as everything can have no conditionalities
###6272 for in fact, we are all everything at once.
###6276 -If it's true that we're all from the center of a star
###6279 every atom in each of us from the center of a star
###6281 then we're all the same thing.
###6283 Even a Coke machine or a cigarette butt in the street in Buffalo
###6285 is made out of atoms that came from a star.
###6287 They've all been recycled thousands of times
###6289 as have you and I. And therefore, it's only me out there.
###6294 So what is there to be afraid of?
###6296 What is there that needs solace seeking?
###6298 Nothing. There's nothing to be afraid of because it's all us.
###6301 The trouble is we have been separated by being born
###6304 and given a name and an identity and being individuated.
###6307 We've been separated from the oneness and that's what religion exploits.
###6310 .
###6310 That people have this yearning to be part of the overall one again.
###6314 So they exploit that. They call it god, they say he has rules
###6317 and I think it's cruel.
###6319 I think you can do it absent religion.
###6322 "An extraterrestrial visitor examining the differences among human societies
###6326 would find those differences trivial compared to the similarities
###6329 Our lives, our past and our future are tied to the sun, the moon and the stars...
###6332 We humans have seen the atoms which constitute all of nature and the forces that sculpted this work...
###6337 .
###6337 And we, we who embody the local eyes and ears and thoughts and feelings of the cosmos,
###6341 we have begun at least to wonder about our origins... star stuff contemplating the stars
###6345 .
###6345 organized collections of ten billion billion billion atoms,
###6348 contemplating the evolution of nature, tracing that long path
###6351 by which it arrived at consciousness here on the planet earth...
###6354 Our loyalties are to the species and to the planet.
###6357 Our obligation to survive and flourish is owed not just to ourselves
###6360 but also to that cosmos ancient and vast from which we spring.
###6364 We are one species. We are star stuff harvesting star light.
###6367 - Carl Sagan - 1934-1996
###6369 -It's time to claim the unity
###6371 our outmoded social systems have broken apart
###6374 and work together to create a sustainable, global society
###6378 where everyone is taken care of and everyone is truly free.
###6383 .
###6383 Your personal beliefs, whatever they may be
###6385 are meaningless when it comes to the necessities of life.
###6389 Every human being is born naked
###6391 needing warmth, food, water, shelter.
###6395 Everything else is auxiliary.
###6397 Therefore, the most important issue at hand
###6399 is the intelligent management of the Earth's resources.
###6403 This can never be accomplished in a monetary system
###6406 for the pursuit of profit is the pursuit of self interest
###6410 and therefore imbalance is inherent.
###6413 Simultaneously, politicians are useless
###6417 for our true problems in life are technical not political.
###6421 Furthermore, ideologies that separate humanity
###6424 .
###6425 such as religion, need strong reflection in the community
###6428 in regard to its value, purpose and social relevancy.
###6432 Hopefully, through time
###6434 religion will lose its materialism and basis in superstition
###6438 and move into the useful field of philosophy.
###6441 The fact is, society today is backwards
###6444 with politicians constantly talking about protection and security
###6448 rather than creation, unity and progress.
###6452 The US alone now spends about
###6454 $500 billion dollars annually on defense.
###6457 That is enough to send every high school senior in America
###6461 to a four year college.
###6463 In the 1940s the Manhattan Project
###6466 produced the first true weapon of mass destruction.
###6469 This program employed 130,000 people, at an extreme financial cost.
###6475 Imagine what our life would be like today if that group of scientists
###6480 instead of working on a way of killing people
###6483 worked on a way to create a self-sustaining abundant world.
###6487 Life today would be very, very different if that was their goal.
###6493 .
###6493 Instead of weapons of mass destruction
###6496 it is time to unleash something much more powerful.
###6500 Weapons of Mass Creation (WMCs).
###6505 Our true divinity is in our ability to create.
###6508 And armed with the understanding of the symbiotic connections of life
###6512 while being guided by the emergent nature of reality
###6516 there is nothing we cannot do or accomplish.
###6521 Of course, we face strong barriers
###6523 in the form of established power structures that refuse to change.
###6528 .
###6528 At the heart of these structures is the monetary system.
###6531 As explained earlier, the fractional reserve policy
###6534 is a form of slavery through debt
###6536 where it is literally impossible for society to be free.
###6540 In turn, free market capitalism in the form of free trade
###6544 uses debt to imprison the world and manipulate countries
###6547 into subservience to a handful of large business and political powers.
###6552 Apart from these obvious amoralities
###6554 the system itself is based on competition
###6557 which immediately destroys the possibility
###6559 of large scale collaborations for the common good.
###6562 Hence paralyzing any attempt at true global sustainability.
###6569 These financial and corporate structures are now obsolete
###6573 and they must be outgrown.
###6576 Of course, we can not be naive enough to think that
###6578 the business and financial elite are going to subscribe to this idea
###6581 for they will lose power and control.
###6583 Therefore, peacefully yet highly strategic action must be taken.
###6588 The most powerful course of action is simple.
###6590 We have to alter our behavior
###6593 to force the power structure to the will of the people.
###6597 We must stop supporting the system.
###6601 The only way the establishment will change
###6604 is by our refusal to participate while continuously acknowledging
###6608 its endless flaws and corruptions.
###6611 -They're not gonna give up the monetary system
###6614 because of our designs or what we recommend.
###6617 The system has to fail
###6619 and people have to lose confidence in their elected leaders.
###6624 That will be a major turning point
###6627 if The Venus Project is offered as a possible alternative.
###6632 If not, I fear the consequences.
###6635 The trends now indicate that our country is going bankrupt.
###6640 The probability is our country will move
###6643 toward a military dictatorship to prevent riots
###6647 and complete social breakdown.
###6650 Once the US breaks down, all the other cultures
###6653 will undergo similar things.
###6656 -As of now, the world financial system
###6658 is on the brink of collapse due to its own shortcomings.
###6662 The controller of currencies stated in 2003
###6665 that the interest on the US national debt
###6667 will not be affordable in less than ten years.
###6671 This theoretically means total bankruptcy for the US economy
###6674 and its implications for the world are immense.
###6677 In turn the fractional reserve based monetary system
###6680 is reaching its theoretical limits of expansion
###6683 and the banking failures you are seeing are just the beginning.
###6687 This is why inflation is skyrocketing, all debt is at record levels
###6691 .
###6691 and the government and FED are hemorrhaging new money
###6694 to bailout the corrupt system.
###6696 For the only way to keep the banks going
###6698 is by making more money.
###6700 The only way to make more money is to create more debt and inflation.
###6704 .
###6704 It is simply a matter of time before the tables turn
###6707 and there's no one is willing to take new loans
###6710 while defaults grow as people are unable
###6712 to afford their current loans.
###6715 Then the expansion of money will stop
###6717 and contraction will begin on a scale never before seen
###6721 ending a century long pyramid scheme.
###6724 This has already begun.
###6727 Therefore, we need to expose this financial failure for what it is
###6731 using this weakness to our advantage.
###6734 Here are some suggestions:
###6736 Expose the banking fraud.
###6738 Citibank, JP Morgan Chase and Bank of America
###6741 are the most powerful controllers
###6743 within the corrupt Federal Reserve system.
###6746 It's time to boycott these institutions.
###6749 If you have a bank account or a credit card with any of them
###6752 move your money to another bank.
###6755 If you have a mortgage, re-finance with another bank.
###6758 If you own their stock, sell it.
###6760 If you work for them, quit.
###6762 This gesture will express contempt
###6765 for the true powers behind the private banking cartel
###6768 known as the Federal Reserve.
###6770 And create awareness about the fraud of the banking system itself.
###6774 Two: Turn off the TV news.
###6777 Visit the emerging independent news agencies on the internet
###6780 for your information.
###6782 CNN, NBC, ABC, FOX and all the others
###6786 present all news pre-filtered to maintain the status quo.
###6791 With four corporations owning all major media outlets
###6794 objective information is impossible.
###6797 This is the true beauty of the internet
###6799 and the establishment has been losing control
###6802 because of this free flow of information.
###6804 We must protect the internet at all times
###6807 as it is truly our savior right now.
###6810 Three: Don't ever allow yourself, your family or anyone you know
###6817 .
###6817 to ever join the military.
###6821 This is an obsolete institution
###6823 now used exclusively for maintaining an establishment
###6827 that is no longer relevant.
###6829 US soldiers in Iraq work for US corporations, not the people.
###6833 .
###6833 Propaganda forces us to believe that war is natural
###6836 and the military is an honorable institution.
###6839 Well, if war is natural
###6841 why are there 18 suicides every single day
###6844 by American veterans who have post-traumatic stress disorder?
###6848 .
###6848 If our military men and women are so honored
###6851 why is it that 25% of the American homeless population are veterans?
###6858 .
###6858 Four: Stop supporting the energy companies.
###6861 .
###6861 If you live in a detached house, get off the grid.
###6864 .
###6864 Investigate every means of making your home self-sustainable
###6868 with clean energy.
###6870 Solar, wind and other renewable energies
###6872 are now affordable consumer realities
###6875 and considering the never ending rising costs of traditional energies
###6879 it will likely be a cheaper investment over time.
###6882 If you drive, get the smallest car you can
###6885 and consider using one of the many conversion technologies
###6888 that can enable your car to be a hybrid
###6890 electric or run on anything other than establishment fuels.
###6895 Five: Reject the political system.
###6898 .
###6898 The illusion of democracy is an insult to our intelligence.
###6902 In a monetary system, there is no such thing as a true democracy
###6906 and there never was.
###6908 We have two political parties
###6909 owned by the same set of corporate lobbyists.
###6913 They are placed in their positions by the corporations
###6916 with popularity artificially projected by their media.
###6919 In a system of inherent corruption
###6922 the change of personnel every couple of years
###6924 has very little relevance.
###6926 Instead of pretending that the political game has any true meaning
###6930 focus your energy on how to transcend this failed system.
###6936 And six: Join the movement.
###6939 .
###6939 Go to the thezeitgeistmovement. com
###6941 and help us create the largest mass movement for social change
###6945 the world has ever seen.
###6947 We must mobilize and educate everyone
###6949 about the inherent corruption of our current world system
###6953 along with the only true sustainable solution
###6956 declaring all the natural resources on the planet
###6959 as common heritage to all people
###6962 while informing everyone as to the true state of technology
###6966 and how we can all be free if the world works together
###6970 rather than fights.
###6972 The choice lies with you.
###6974 You can continue to be a slave to the financial system
###6977 and watch the continuous wars, depressions and injustice across the globe
###6981 while placating yourself with vain entertainment
###6984 and materialistic garbage;
###6986 or, you can focus your energy on true, meaningful, lasting, holistic change
###6991 which actually has the realistic ability to support
###6995 and free all humans with no one left behind.
###7000 But in the end, the most relevant change
###7004 must occur first inside of you.
###7007 The real revolution is the revolution of consciousness
###7011 and each one of us first needs to eliminate
###7015 the diversionary, materialistic noise
###7017 we have been conditioned to think is true;
###7021 while discovering, amplifying and aligning
###7024 with the signal coming from our true empirical oneness.
###7031 It is up to you.
###7035 -What we are trying in all these discussions and talks here
###7040 is to see if we cannot radically bring about a transformation of the mind.
###7048 Not accept things as they are
###7053 but to understand it, to go into it, to examine it
###7056 give your heart and your mind with everything that you have to find out
###7061 a way of living differently.
###7068 But, that depends on you and not somebody else.
###7073 Because in this there is no teacher
###7075 no pupil
###7077 there's no leader
###7080 there's no guru
###7081 there's no master, no savior.
###7083 You yourself are the teacher and the pupil, you're the master, you're the guru, you are the leader
###7089 you are everything!
###7092 And
###7095 to understand
###7097 is to transform what is.
