0:0:25,398 --> 0:0:27,72
HAMILTON MORRIS: I've spent
months reading every


4
0:0:27,72 --> 0:0:30,56
anthropological and ethnographic
report of the


5
0:0:30,56 --> 0:0:34,18
Haitian Zombie, researching the
pharmacology, toxicity,


6
0:0:34,18 --> 0:0:38,42
and biosynthesis of TTX, poring
through books on occult


7
0:0:38,42 --> 0:0:42,17
magic, medicinal plants of the
Caribbean, animal sacrifice,


8
0:0:42,17 --> 0:0:46,6
vodou theology, and African
folklore, hoping to grasp the


9
0:0:46,6 --> 0:0:48,12
strange phenomenon
of zombification.


10
0:0:48,12 --> 0:0:52,7



11
0:0:52,7 --> 0:0:56,77
WADE DAVIS: You always have to
investigate the belief system


12
0:0:56,77 --> 0:1:0,6
that mediates the
pharmacological event or the


13
0:1:0,6 --> 0:1:1,78
pharmacological possibility.


14
0:1:1,78 --> 0:1:4,97
So that really led to the
second phase of the


15
0:1:4,97 --> 0:1:6,81
investigation, what
is a zombie?


16
0:1:6,81 --> 0:1:10,883
And the quintessential act
of making a zombie


17
0:1:10,883 --> 0:1:14,66
is a natural act.


18
0:1:14,66 --> 0:1:16,79
HAMILTON MORRIS: Haiti was once
one of the most valuable


19
0:1:16,79 --> 0:1:20,39
pieces of land in the world,
exporting well over 100


20
0:1:20,39 --> 0:1:23,76
million pounds of sugar each
year, in addition to the


21
0:1:23,76 --> 0:1:27,26
finest indigo, coffee, and
tobacco plants with the


22
0:1:27,26 --> 0:1:30,18
largest leaves in
the Caribbean.


23
0:1:30,18 --> 0:1:34,1
Today, after centuries of
kleptocratic politicians and


24
0:1:34,1 --> 0:1:37,9
religious oppression, Haiti is
the poorest country in the


25
0:1:37,9 --> 0:1:39,21
Western hemisphere.


26
0:1:39,21 --> 0:1:42,9
The city is unimaginably
chaotic.


27
0:1:42,9 --> 0:1:45,46
The streets, alleys, and canals
are littered with the


28
0:1:45,46 --> 0:1:48,6
skin of organic matter.


29
0:1:48,6 --> 0:1:51,47
Peels, husks, and shells of
every imaginable food line the


30
0:1:51,47 --> 0:1:56,6
sides of the road, waist
high, like snowbanks.


31
0:1:56,6 --> 0:2:0,26
The past 100 years have been
especially turbulent for


32
0:2:0,26 --> 0:2:5,15
Haiti, including more than 10 US
military interventions and


33
0:2:5,15 --> 0:2:11,52
an occupation from
1915 to 1934.


34
0:2:11,52 --> 0:2:15,83
US Marines returned home with
weird tales of potions, black


35
0:2:15,83 --> 0:2:18,11
magic, and the living dead.


36
0:2:18,11 --> 0:2:21,7
They published their stories in
pulp novels, which serve to


37
0:2:21,7 --> 0:2:25,1
inspire a series of horror
movies, in doing so, sculpting


38
0:2:25,1 --> 0:2:29,8
the American concept
of the zombie.

I arrive at my luxurious

41
0:2:45,26 --> 0:2:49,4
Charles Addams was a frequent
guest at the Oloffson Hotel,


42
0:2:49,4 --> 0:2:51,49
and he used its architecture
to inspire the


43
0:2:51,49 --> 0:2:53,85

imaginable--

0:3:0,36 --> 0:3:4,43
fretwork spandrels, dentate
bargeboard pendants, openwork


47
0:3:4,43 --> 0:3:8,9

gabled dormers, and

0:3:8,9 --> 0:3:12,28

iron.


49

Essentially, it looks like
a giant haunted doily.

I walk downstairs and meet my
guide and bodyguard, Alex,


57
0:3:45,58 --> 0:3:48,54
who's going to take me to a
vodou ceremony deep in the


58

Hey, what's going on?

to be with you.

ALEX LEGROS: All right.

HAMILTON MORRIS: He's
a very large man.


67
0:3:59,67 --> 0:4:4,58
He tells me that he was shot
in the face 14 times,


68
0:4:4,58 --> 0:4:6,65
twice in the eye.


69
0:4:6,65 --> 0:4:10,14
And it makes it difficult for
him to drink alcohol.


70
0:4:10,14 --> 0:4:14,78
He also tells me Haiti is the
only place on Earth where


71

conversations vacillate


76
0:4:26,73 --> 0:4:31,57
between rational and utterly
fantastical.


77

WADE DAVIS: I remember the
first week or so I was in


78
0:4:34,44 --> 0:4:38,0
Haiti, I just felt I was
just blown away by the


79
0:4:38,0 --> 0:4:39,5
sense of the spiritual.


80
0:4:39,5 --> 0:4:42,5
Where did we get this idea
of vodou as kind of


81
0:4:42,5 --> 0:4:44,74
evil or black magic?


82
0:4:44,74 --> 0:4:48,7
It really goes back to the fact
that, if you're to name


83
0:4:48,7 --> 0:4:50,95
the great religions of the
world, what do you say?


84
0:4:50,95 --> 0:4:52,94
Christianity, Judaism,
Buddhism,


85
0:4:52,94 --> 0:4:55,29
Islam, Hinduism, whenever.

There's always one continent
left out.


87
0:4:57,44 --> 0:4:58,53
Sub-Saharan Africa.


88
0:4:58,53 --> 0:5:0,36
And the tacit assumption
being that black


89
0:5:0,36 --> 0:5:1,35
people had no religion.


90
0:5:1,35 --> 0:5:2,84
Well of course, by ethnographic


91
0:5:2,84 --> 0:5:4,9
definition, they did.

93

HAMILTON MORRIS: Vodou
is much more than


94
0:5:13,89 --> 0:5:15,98
zombification and poisoning.


95
0:5:15,98 --> 0:5:18,84
In fact, these are fringe
matters most priests do not


96
0:5:18,84 --> 0:5:21,56
concern themselves with.


97
0:5:21,56 --> 0:5:25,49
Tonight, we've been invited to
attend a bi-yearly ceremony to

0:5:34,19 --> 0:5:35,86
powdered cornmeal.


101
0:5:35,86 --> 0:5:39,226
Each veve symbolizes a different
Loa, or god.

potions, and bottles of Carlo

of 21 hot peppers.

have sex on a Thursday again

for the rest of my life,
I will be killed.

I ask for a moment to consider
my options, but am given no

hand in marriage.

around in its neck, pulling out

while draining its blood into
