1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:2,61



2
0:0:2,61 --> 0:0:4,71
SAM SMYTH: How about this one?


3
0:0:4,71 --> 0:0:9,41
What you know about an
age 14 Antwuan Dixon?


4
0:0:9,41 --> 0:0:10,58
No tattoos.


5
0:0:10,58 --> 0:0:12,0
Who else we got?


6
0:0:12,0 --> 0:0:17,2
How about an age 12
David Gonzalez?


7
0:0:17,2 --> 0:0:18,58
Tony Tave.


8
0:0:18,58 --> 0:0:20,51
More Antwuan.


9
0:0:20,51 --> 0:0:21,43
So this is it.


10
0:0:21,43 --> 0:0:25,71
This is the television where
Sean and Mo were discovered.


11
0:0:25,71 --> 0:0:26,78
This is their stuff.


12
0:0:26,78 --> 0:0:29,85
This is the early VHS tapes.


13
0:0:29,85 --> 0:0:31,83
See, this is Malto's.


14
0:0:31,83 --> 0:0:42,3
13 years old when
filmed, 14 now.


15
0:0:42,3 --> 0:0:44,715
I don't know why I wasn't thrown
off right off the bat.


16
0:0:44,715 --> 0:0:46,8
That white hat looked insane.


17
0:0:46,8 --> 0:0:48,48
SEAN MALTO: I wasn't really
filming for a "sponsor me"


18
0:0:48,48 --> 0:0:48,97
video at all.


19
0:0:48,97 --> 0:0:50,62
I just was skating.


20
0:0:50,62 --> 0:0:51,73
I just love skating.


21
0:0:51,73 --> 0:0:56,66
I was a 13-year-old kid, and
skating was still new to me,


22
0:0:56,66 --> 0:0:58,67
and we were just having fun.


23
0:0:58,67 --> 0:1:0,1
I didn't even send
it in actually.


24
0:1:0,1 --> 0:1:1,39
The guys at Escapist
sent it in.


25
0:1:1,39 --> 0:1:4,87
I was on flow for a good
two and a half years.


26
0:1:4,87 --> 0:1:7,64
That was a long time I
was tripping on it.


27
0:1:7,64 --> 0:1:10,34
SAM SMYTH: I think he went to
a Tampa Am when I was still


28
0:1:10,34 --> 0:1:11,4
flowing him.


29
0:1:11,4 --> 0:1:17,55
And I think Toy Machine hit him
up and maybe Flip, too.


30
0:1:17,55 --> 0:1:24,2
And he shut them down, so I
was like OK, he's solid.


31
0:1:24,2 --> 0:1:27,58
SEAN MALTO: I sent in eight
sponsor tapes, thinking is


32
0:1:27,58 --> 0:1:28,82
this going to happen?


33
0:1:28,82 --> 0:1:33,13
And then you have Mike Mo, who
was on flow for six months,


34
0:1:33,13 --> 0:1:35,8
was on probably his second
sponsor tape, and we go on the


35
0:1:35,8 --> 0:1:39,17
first trip together, and I was
like, damn, is it that easy


36
0:1:39,17 --> 0:1:41,6
for other people?


37
0:1:41,6 --> 0:1:45,62
SAM SMYTH: So, look we got
two tapes, three DVDs.


38
0:1:45,62 --> 0:1:50,43
This is over a year and
a half flow period.


39
0:1:50,43 --> 0:1:52,37
I mean, that's how you
get on the team.


40
0:1:52,37 --> 0:1:56,15



41
0:1:56,15 --> 0:1:58,32
The kid had motivation.


42
0:1:58,32 --> 0:1:58,745
He had drive.


43
0:1:58,745 --> 0:2:0,88
He really wanted on.


44
0:2:0,88 --> 0:2:3,2
So we made his dream
a reality.


45
0:2:3,2 --> 0:2:4,495
This is Mike Mo's.


46
0:2:4,495 --> 0:2:6,383
Mike Mo only did two tapes.


47
0:2:6,383 --> 0:2:14,28



48
0:2:14,28 --> 0:2:15,12
SEAN MALTO: Yeah,
Sam called me.


49
0:2:15,12 --> 0:2:18,7
He was like, hey, we want to
start giving you boards.


50
0:2:18,7 --> 0:2:21,8
I had Eric Koston posters
hanging up on my wall, so I


51
0:2:21,8 --> 0:2:22,87
was like, no way.


52
0:2:22,87 --> 0:2:24,265
I was super psyched.


53
0:2:24,265 --> 0:2:27,78
And then I remember telling my
mom about it and my aunt, she


54
0:2:27,78 --> 0:2:29,44
was in town at the time.


55
0:2:29,44 --> 0:2:31,2
And they went, and they
looked on the site.


56
0:2:31,2 --> 0:2:33,69
And it was right when Yeah
Right! was going on.


57
0:2:33,69 --> 0:2:36,66
And I think one of the trailers
was Koston yelling in


58
0:2:36,66 --> 0:2:39,36
that homeless dude's face after
everybody came in the


59
0:2:39,36 --> 0:2:41,73
car, and they were like,
these are the guys


60
0:2:41,73 --> 0:2:42,47
are giving you boards?


61
0:2:42,47 --> 0:2:44,34
And I was like, yeah.


62
0:2:44,34 --> 0:2:47,72
SAM SMYTH: After we had just
known each other through


63
0:2:47,72 --> 0:2:51,48
video, there was this
opportunity to actually get


64
0:2:51,48 --> 0:2:55,15
Sean and Mo on a trip with some
of the other team, and


65
0:2:55,15 --> 0:2:57,47
that was to Toronto, Canada.


66
0:2:57,47 --> 0:2:59,84
SEAN MALTO: They're going on a
trip to Canada, and they were


67
0:2:59,84 --> 0:3:2,232
like hey, do you want to go?


68
0:3:2,232 --> 0:3:2,6
[BLEEP]


69
0:3:2,6 --> 0:3:4,9
of course I want to go.


70
0:3:4,9 --> 0:3:6,6
Yeah, go hang out the
Girl team in Canada.


71
0:3:6,6 --> 0:3:8,13
I was psyched on that.


72
0:3:8,13 --> 0:3:10,32
So that was the first
trip that me and


73
0:3:10,32 --> 0:3:12,5
Mike Mo went on together.


74
0:3:12,5 --> 0:3:15,76
SAM SMYTH: Mo and Sean were in
the same boat, being that they


75
0:3:15,76 --> 0:3:18,48
didn't really know any
of the guys too much.


76
0:3:18,48 --> 0:3:20,75
I was pretty much the only
one they really knew.


77
0:3:20,75 --> 0:3:23,57
They told me later that they
really tripped out when they


78
0:3:23,57 --> 0:3:29,53
saw, at baggage claim, Koston
grabbing golf clubs.


79
0:3:29,53 --> 0:3:32,22



80
0:3:32,22 --> 0:3:36,59
There was probably l a period
when I was telling him, look


81
0:3:36,59 --> 0:3:38,86
dude, you're 100%.


82
0:3:38,86 --> 0:3:42,37
We were just waiting for the
opportunity to get him on the


83
0:3:42,37 --> 0:3:43,82
road with the boys.


84
0:3:43,82 --> 0:3:47,28
I don't think he was totally
wondering where he was going


85
0:3:47,28 --> 0:3:50,39
until that Canada trip, but
that was what for sure


86
0:3:50,39 --> 0:3:52,61
solidified it.


87
0:3:52,61 --> 0:3:55,12
SEAN MALTO: After the Yes We
Canada trip, that free DVD


88
0:3:55,12 --> 0:4:1,2
came out, and then they had a
little part of me and Mike Mo.


89
0:4:1,2 --> 0:4:5,142
And that was our introduction
to the team.


90
0:4:5,142 --> 0:4:7,5
When that came out that
was like, you're


91
0:4:7,5 --> 0:4:12,195
on, and I was psyched.


92
0:4:12,195 --> 0:4:15,89
I get to hang out with these
guys for a long time.


93
0:4:15,89 --> 0:4:17,579
I get to travel with
them every year.


94
0:4:17,579 --> 0:4:19,589
It was a dream come true.


95
0:4:19,589 --> 0:4:22,76
SAM SMYTH: I'm super proud
of these guys.


96
0:4:22,76 --> 0:4:25,3
I can take all the credit.


97
0:4:25,3 --> 0:4:28,24
Those are the dudes that are
doing it themselves, and


98
0:4:28,24 --> 0:4:31,97
they've come a super,
super long way.


99
0:4:31,97 --> 0:4:37,53
And I didn't have to
much to do it that,


100
0:4:37,53 --> 0:4:40,16
besides noticing them.


101
0:4:40,16 --> 0:4:43,16
But the fact that it was me
that noticed them makes me


102
0:4:43,16 --> 0:4:44,77
super proud.


103
0:4:44,77 --> 0:4:48,53
SEAN MALTO: Filming for Pretty
Sweet now, it's just a


104
0:4:48,53 --> 0:4:50,72
different caliber, I guess.


105
0:4:50,72 --> 0:4:53,57
When you're in a video with Guy
Mariano and Mike Johnson


106
0:4:53,57 --> 0:4:56,1
and Cory Kennedy and stuff.


107
0:4:56,1 --> 0:4:57,9
Yeah, it's crazy.


108
0:4:57,9 --> 0:5:0,57
You have a lot of pressure to
come through and have a good


109
0:5:0,57 --> 0:5:3,69
video part, which
it's still fun.


110
0:5:3,69 --> 0:5:4,4
You go out.


111
0:5:4,4 --> 0:5:7,7
You can mess around and stuff,
but there's a time where you


112
0:5:7,7 --> 0:5:7,81
got to get serious.


113
0:5:7,81 --> 0:5:11,83
And all right, I have to sit
here and try this trick for


114
0:5:11,83 --> 0:5:15,44
three hours and hopefully
land it.


115
0:5:15,44 --> 0:5:21,1



116
0:5:21,1 --> 0:5:21,76
SAM SMYTH: What was
your question?


117
0:5:21,76 --> 0:5:22,455
Sorry.


118
0:5:22,455 --> 0:5:23,705
I had zoned out.


119
0:5:23,705 --> 0:7:23,705
