###1 FEMALE SPEAKER: Thank you a lot for coming to our talk.
###4 It's my pleasure to introduce today's distinguished guest
###7 speaker, Dr. John Gray, a great author of the book "Men Are
###11 from Mars, Women Are Venus," the best-selling relationship
###15 book of all years.
###17 He wrote 18 other books, and you can read about them
###20 on his website and his [INAUDIBLE] publications.
###25 And I won't keep you longer, and I'll
###27 let John Gray to speak for himself
###29 and share with you the differences
###31 between the genders.
###32 Thank you, John, for coming.
###33 JOHN GRAY: Thank you for having me here.
###35 
###39 Well, it's really fun for me to be at Google,
###42 since I live on Google.
###45 It's a researcher's dream to be able to Google everything
###48 instantly.
###49 You don't understand something, Google it.
###51 Understand something, Google it.
###53 I remember one of my mentors a long time
###55 ago was saying that if, when you're speaking, if you use one
###58 word that somebody can't understand,
###61 then they tend to blank out on everything else you say.
###64 And one of the great things for Google for me
###66 is I'll be reading research and this and this,
###68 and if a word comes along I don't understand,
###69 I can immediately Google that and come back.
###72 Because to truly understand something,
###74 you have to actually understand every word.
###76 But we intuitively think we're going to get it at the end,
###79 but we don't.
###81 So in my message on "Men Are from Mars,
###83 Women Are from Venus," what's so much fun for me is, typically,
###86 people can relate to the examples
###89 from your own personal experience.
###91 So just to know you a little bit as my audience
###93 so I give the right talk, who has read "Men Are from Mars,
###97 Women Are from Venus"?
###98 How many of you read it?
###100 So a lot of you haven't.
###101 OK, now, how many of you who haven't have heard of it?
###105 So your parents read it, right?
###108 That was when I knew I was getting old,
###109 when people would come up and they'd go,
###110 oh, I love your book, and my parents read it.
###113 
###115 They started going on walks together.
###117 They actually are so much happier afterwards,
###119 so they thank me.
###120 And I said, well, when you get ready,
###121 you'll probably want to read the book, too.
###123 So I'm going to give-- for those of you haven't read "Men Are
###126 from Mars"-- some of the basic ideas of that in our short
###128 presentation, and we'll also have room for question
###131 and answers, if you like to ask questions.
###132 I'll also briefly talk about my most recent book, which
###136 is called "Work with Me," which is about 25 books later.
###139 I've applied the principles of understanding
###142 gender differences in a positive way.
###145 Because so much of the time, when men and women
###147 show up differently in a relationship,
###150 we often have an intuitive reaction, which is wrong.
###153 How many of you have read the book called "Slow Thinker, Fast
###156 Thinker"?
###157 It was a good book, but it talks about most
###159 of our interpretation of reality is automatic,
###163 kind of like I know that that building's quite far away,
###165 and you're closer to me.
###167 And when we're in relationships, when our partners say or do
###170 things, we have an automatic interpretation,
###172 which is often wrong, particularly
###175 when it's the opposite sex.
###178 So a lot of my ideas, I think the popularity
###180 of "Men Are from Mars" was that you really
###182 don't have to do anything to change
###184 your relationship to the better.
###186 Because so many of the problems that couples
###188 have in relationships is misinterpretation.
###192 And so if you can start to interpret a situation
###194 correctly, you find out the problem
###197 is not as big as you thought it was.
###199 There's an old Eastern Indian story
###202 of the person who sees a snake on the ground, and it's dark,
###205 and they start yelling and screaming, snake, snake.
###208 And somebody turns on the light, and it's a stick.
###211 So so many of the problems I see with my couples
###214 as a marriage counselor are big problems to them,
###217 and then I explain it to them, and it's a stick,
###219 and then you can work with the stick.
###222 So in "Work with Me"-- that's the second book
###225 I'll be briefly talking about.
###226 That's my most recent published book.
###229 It talks about gender differences in the workplace,
###232 and how are these basic blind spots between men and women.
###235 And we teach through human resources
###238 in different companies.
###239 We go in, and we do these workshops sometimes.
###242 And we did a survey of over 100,000 men and women
###247 from workshops.
###247 So they filled out this survey before they took the course.
###250 And we found that there are these basic blind spots.
###253 There's eight that I focus on, but I'll mention one
###255 right now, which is we asked the women,
###259 do you feel appreciated in the workplace?
###262 And over half of the women felt they were not
###265 being appreciated by men.
###268 And then we ask the men, do you appreciate women
###271 in the workplace?
###272 And over 90% of men said, of course.
###277 So that's a blind spot.
###279 Men think that they're communicating appreciation,
###282 but women often not feeling appreciated.
###285 And this gives rise to one of the basic differences
###288 between men and women, which is that women feel valued
###291 and appreciated when you know what they do.
###295 When a man gets paid, get acknowledged for the result--
###299 good job, you did this, now you get this promotion or whatever.
###302 That makes a man feel valued and appreciated.
###305 Acknowledge what I do.
###307 But for a woman, she wants to be acknowledged for what she does,
###310 but she also wants to be seen.
###313 She wants to be heard.
###314 She wants to be understood.
###317 And this was my first insight into the world of "Men Are from
###320 Mars, Women Are from Venus"-- what was it--
###322 over 30 years ago.
###325 Before I realized it, before I was even married to my wife.
###328 We've been married 28 years.
###330 But Helen is my assistant 30 years ago.
###333 And Helen comes to me and says she wants to quit.
###335 And I said, why would you want to quit?
###337 You're the best.
###338 I just gave you a raise.
###339 You make as much as me, basically.
###341 And she said, it's not about the money.
###345 I just don't feel appreciated.
###348 And I said, all right.
###349 Well, hold on.
###349 Why don't you feel appreciated?
###351 Because I thought she was a gift from heaven.
###354 And she said, well, John, you don't even know what I do.
###358 And my reaction as a man was, that's
###360 why I appreciate you so much.
###363 And we laugh because we can see the logic of that.
###366 Of course.
###366 I don't have to think.
###367 I don't have to plan.
###368 I don't have to do anything.
###369 She made all the arrangements.
###371 She put the money in the bank.
###372 She paid my bills.
###372 She organized my seminars.
###374 She handled all my clients.
###376 I just showed up at work and counseled eight women today.
###379 Which, by the way, when "Men Are from Mars" came out,
###381 everybody was so upset at me.
###384 Some people still are.
###385 How do you know this?
###385 I said, well, my credentials, basically,
###388 as a counselor-- how many men have sat in a room
###391 and listened to women talk for eight hours a day for 10 years?
###394 
###397 You have to get paid a lot of money to do that job.
###399 
###403 So I said to her, just let me-- she said,
###408 you don't even know what I do.
###410 And so I caught on very quickly.
###411 I said, well, give me a week, and let's see.
###414 So Helen continued to work for me for years.
###416 I just celebrated her birthday with her just recently.
###418 And all I did differently-- and Helen stayed with me
###423 and felt valued and appreciated--
###425 was I took five extra minutes a day to find out what she did.
###430 And once I knew what she did, then she felt part of a team.
###435 Very important for women to feel part of a team,
###437 not to feel isolated.
###439 Second thing is she felt seen, and that I
###442 come in and actually look at her.
###446 If you're a programmer, an engineer brain, you're a guy,
###450 eye contact is not so important for you.
###453 But to women, it is.
###454 Watch women talk, they'll be looking at each other,
###457 whereas guys could be looking off or looking down or looking
###459 around, sometimes looking at each other,
###461 but always when there's a point.
###463 If you're talking social talk with guys,
###466 we have to be looking at a football game or a computer
###468 screen.
###469 It was just the other night, I was at a party
###472 with one of my old friends who was sitting next to me.
###475 And my wife is sitting over here.
###476 Actually, it was Helen's birthday,
###478 and she's sitting in front.
###479 And I'm talking to Martin, his name is,
###482 and my wife points out to me 3/4 of the way
###484 into the evening, John, you're not
###487 looking at Martin when you talk.
###490 You need to look at him.
###493 I said, OK, honey.
###494 I looked at Martin.
###495 He didn't even notice either.
###499 So what I focus on is the little differences
###502 between men and women.
###503 It's not like a woman can't do what a man does.
###505 It's not that a man can't do what a woman does.
###507 And it's not that all men and all women fit into these slots
###510 so neatly.
###511 Generally, about 10% of men will tend
###513 to relate more the female examples.
###515 10% of women will relate more to the male examples.
###519 Women often come up to me and say, gee,
###520 I feel like I'm from Mars.
###522 And I say, well, that's conditioning,
###524 to a great extent.
###526 Women today are conditioned to be like men,
###528 and there's no safety to acknowledge
###530 feminine aspects of who you are.
###532 And part of my message is to validate that,
###534 but not to negate if you're more on your masculine side.
###537 That's great.
###538 That allows you to often fit into the work
###541 world much better.
###543 And women will say to me after they read my book,
###545 they say, yeah, I feel like I've become a man
###547 to become successful, and I'm very confused when I get home.
###550 It's like I feel split.
###552 So I wrote a book, which is called "Why Mars and Venus
###556 Collide" before I wrote this book.
###559 And "Why Mars and Venus Collide" is--
###562 what's happening today is that women go into the workplace.
###568 The workplace stimulates certain hormones.
###571 Now, that hormone is the hormone is the hormone that
###573 gets produced when you're solving problems
###575 and particularly when you have a responsibility,
###577 and it's all up to you, and you're solving a problem.
###580 Now, what hormone would that be?
###582 That hormone is called testosterone.
###585 It's the emergency hormone.
###587 It's the hormone when you feel pressured,
###589 when you feel a sense of got to go fast.
###591 Got to get this done.
###592 It's up to me.
###593 Nobody else is going to do it.
###595 Or you sacrifice because it's a difficult thing,
###598 but you say, I can handle it, because I'm getting paid,
###600 and that's my job.
###602 That's the hormone only gets produced.
###603 It's testosterone.
###605 Well, the difference between a woman's body and a man's body
###610 is hormonal.
###612 These are real physiological differences.
###614 The average male needs 30 times more
###619 testosterone to be in a good mood.
###622 The number one cause of heart disease in men
###625 is a low testosterone.
###627 There's no man that has a heart attack unless he
###629 has low testosterone, high estrogen, estrogen
###633 being the feminine hormone.
###635 As men get older, they start thinking, I want to quit.
###638 That's because faulty diet, lack of exercise, too many
###644 estrogens in our environment.
###646 What happens is estrogen levels star
###648 rising, pushing testosterone levels down.
###653 That is number one cause of heart disease.
###655 As soon as the man retires, which
###657 means he doesn't have work, which means,
###659 I have to get up and do something.
###661 I have to solve problems.
###663 A man has one year before his first heart attack.
###666 This is a statistical fact.
###668 So a statistical fact.
###670 Not every man.
###671 But men need to work.
###672 Men need to go out there and solve problems,
###675 because solving problems releases testosterone,
###678 and testosterone a hormone that lowers stress for men.
###683 Does testosterone lower stress for women?
###686 No.
###687 Does testosterone being released feel good to women?
###690 Yes.
###691 It feels good.
###693 So women can love their testosterone job,
###697 but their stress levels rise and rise and rise.
###700 And this is shown in a study that
###702 was done in Scandinavian countries of several hundred
###706 thousand women and men being tested,
###708 and they found that-- and this is
###710 one of the areas where you have the greatest
###712 equality between men and women-- I
###715 get frustrated when I go there, because they call it equality.
###717 I call it blindness.
###719 We're all the same, which we're not the same.
###722 But at least there's equal respect
###723 for everybody, which is a good thing.
###725 But real equality is when you can recognize
###727 the differences in the spirit of equality,
###730 equal opportunity, equal respect, regardless
###733 of man, woman, culture, race, whatever.
###738 So what they found in this study in Scandinavia--
###740 huge four-country study-- is that women in the workplace,
###745 their stress levels were twice as high as men's.
###748 
###751 When women came home from the workplace,
###754 their stress levels were four times higher than men.
###757 These are averages.
###759 And that basically means their happiness level is dramatically
###763 declining.
###764 University studies in America have repeatedly
###767 shown that, in the '70s, women's happiness level was way up
###771 here, and men's was down here.
###772 Men has pretty much stayed the same,
###775 and women has dramatically dropped.
###777 So what you get, as women move more into the workplace,
###780 as an average, their happiness goes down.
###784 So what's going on there?
###786 When I say this, I'm not saying, oh, women
###787 shouldn't be in the workplace.
###789 I have three daughters.
###790 They all have jobs and careers.
###791 I've supported that completely.
###792 But they're happy.
###794 Their stress levels are low.
###796 They're educated to understand-- they have two parts.
###799 We all have two parts.
###801 The masculine side is solving problems,
###803 releasing testosterone.
###805 If you're a man, that will lower your stress.
###808 But what lowers stress for women?
###810 Well, this was a huge breakthrough
###811 that happened in 2002 at UCLA.
###817 They discovered that the hormone oxytocin, which is generally
###822 associated childbirth and female orgasm, the hormone oxytocin
###829 is the hormone that actually directly lowers
###831 stress for women.
###833 And without an abundance of oxytocin in your body,
###837 your brain does not have an off switch, which
###841 means when you have problems, if a woman's upset,
###844 she's upset for days and days and days.
###847 She's still thinking about this, thinking about this.
###849 I was just counseling a couple, and they were in their 80s.
###852 And they haven't seen me in about a month,
###855 and she brings up an issue that happened six weeks ago
###857 or a month ago.
###859 He says, I can't believe she's still thinking about this.
###861 I said, you don't understand.
###863 Women don't have an off switch.
###864 They keep going around and around and around.
###867 Now, how many women in this room can relate to that?
###869 You're not on camera, but you can relate to that?
###872 I'm getting some nods.
###873 Can I get some arms up?
###874 Let me just see.
###874 
###878 They've actually put men and women on computer scans
###882 when the sun sets, and what happens for a man and a woman
###886 is very different.
###887 Unless there's an emergency, you say to the man and woman,
###890 you say, sit down and relax.
###892 And you put your brain scans on to measure
###894 blood flow in the brain.
###896 And for the woman, as soon as she sits down,
###899 blood flow increases to the brain.
###902 Brain activity increases.
###904 You ask her, what is she thinking?
###906 What is she thinking?
###908 She's thinking about all the things
###910 she needs to do that she's not doing it
###913 while she's sitting here on this couch.
###915 That's her brain going like this.
###917 You look at the man's brain, blood flow literally stops.
###922 It just goes back here to where he
###924 can keep his body temperature and breathing and so forth.
###928 And you ask him, what are you thinking?
###929 And what does he say?
###931 Nothing.
###931 
###934 And if you didn't have that test, the woman says,
###936 you must be thinking of something.
###938 You must be thinking of something.
###941 And this is the difference.
###942 And so what's going on there, which I talked about
###945 in "Men Are from Mars" long before all this research came
###947 about, I just observed it.
###949 Is that men typically go to work.
###952 They're solving problems all day.
###954 They're releasing testosterone, particularly
###956 if a man is successful, which means he feels confident,
###959 I know how to solve problems.
###961 So if I get in my car, and I'm driving 100 miles an hour,
###965 if I feel like I'm in a good car, and I'm a good driver,
###968 actually my stress level goes down.
###970 How many men can relate to that?
###971 Of course.
###973 You're doing something which is extremely dangerous,
###975 by the way.
###976 Because if you were to let go of the steering wheel,
###978 you would die.
###979 Or if a deer ran out in front of your car, which
###981 you have no control over, you would die.
###984 But your brain, basically, you're
###986 producing huge amounts of testosterone, releasing it,
###989 and dopamine.
###990 Dopamine is the brain chemical focus,
###992 so you're going right into focus zone because there's danger.
###995 So dopamine and testosterone go hand in hand.
###998 So your stress levels are going down.
###1000 So quite often, I noticed that if I got in an argument
###1002 with my wife, or something was stressing me out,
###1004 I'd want to go for a drive in my car.
###1007 And I would just drive a little faster than usual,
###1009 so I have to look front and backwards for the police.
###1012 
###1014 And I would start to relax.
###1016 Now, of course, if my wife was in the car,
###1018 that would raise her stress levels hugely.
###1021 So there's huge differences here in how we cope with stress.
###1024 That's just one little example.
###1026 But, typically, what I would see happening,
###1028 what I still see happening, which a lot of men
###1030 don't do now, and this is part of my message to men,
###1034 is that we would go to work, and we would solve problems,
###1036 and we'd come home from work, and we'd forget problems.
###1040 You have to realize, for thousands
###1041 of years, hundreds of thousands of years--
###1044 I've gone 18 times around the world,
###1046 been with indigenous tribes around the world,
###1048 when the sun sets, the men sit around,
###1051 because their job is in the jungle doing
###1054 what they do when there's sunshine.
###1055 Now they're sitting around, or they're
###1057 a guard sitting around doing nothing, as well.
###1060 So they don't move when the sun sets.
###1062 They actually need to relax.
###1064 And when they relax, their brain, in order to relax,
###1067 their brain literally has the ability
###1069 to forget stressful messages.
###1072 So the way men cope with stress is you solve problems,
###1075 and at the end of the day, you forget your problems.
###1079 And we have a shut off.
###1080 We can turn them off.
###1082 And when you turn off your problems, you relax.
###1085 And when you relax, your body rebuilds testosterone.
###1089 That's how you rebuild testosterone
###1091 is to do anything a woman would consider
###1094 to be a complete waste of time.
###1098 So he'll come home from work.
###1099 He'll sit around, maybe watch the news, sit on his computer,
###1101 do something, play a video game, anything.
###1103 And she's going, but we've got this, and we've got this,
###1105 and we've got this.
###1106 And there's this.
###1107 And you forgot this.
###1107 You're not doing this.
###1108 And she can't understand why he's not
###1110 attending to all those things.
###1112 But he's doing what he has to do to cope with stress, which
###1116 is to turn off all responsibilities
###1119 for a little me time.
###1121 And she's going, well, why does he get me time, and I don't?
###1125 Because you can't.
###1126 
###1130 You should be admiring that.
###1131 You should be going, I wish I could do that.
###1134 And, of course, women, you do subconsciously admire it.
###1136 This is all the spa magazines, all the upper level gold
###1139 watch magazines.
###1140 They always show some beautiful spa resort place,
###1143 and a woman is sitting in meditation.
###1145 And she seems to be so beatifically calm and peaceful.
###1148 You have no idea she's worrying about 50 things.
###1151 But the illusion is that she can turn off her brain
###1154 and be completely happy like that,
###1155 which is an illusion for women today.
###1157 They can't.
###1159 But what this research in 1992 showed is how you can.
###1163 And you can do it.
###1165 The hormone that allows you to relax is oxytocin.
###1170 Oxytocin is stimulated in a variety of ways.
###1173 I've written whole books on oxytocin,
###1175 how to simulate it, how you lose it,
###1177 how you get in, and so forth.
###1178 We'll go a little bit over it today.
###1180 And with oxytocin, when a women is giving love-- OK,
###1185 if you're nurturing others, if you're caring about others,
###1189 if you're thinking about others, if you're helping others--
###1191 basically, if you're taking care of your kids-- because women,
###1194 for thousands and thousands of years,
###1196 if you go to an indigenous tribe,
###1197 you'll see the babies are being born every year.
###1200 Women are just pregnant most of the time.
###1201 They're taking care of the kids.
###1203 When the sun sets, the men are all
###1204 sitting around doing nothing, sharpening their tools
###1207 or whatever, telling stories, or not talking at all.
###1210 Women are completely busy.
###1212 They're nonstop action, nonstop busy, busy, busy.
###1216 But their stress levels are dramatically low.
###1219 What is lowering their stress?
###1222 When you feel you're in an environment
###1223 where there's no time pressure.
###1226 The number one inhibitor of oxytocin production
###1230 is feeling not enough time.
###1233 The number one complaint I hear from women
###1235 today is not enough time.
###1239 There's too much to do, and there's not enough time.
###1242 And when you feel, as a woman, there's not enough time for me
###1246 to do what I'd like to do, to do what
###1248 I enjoy doing-- it's a huge, perplexing thing for men when
###1251 we see women say, I have no time for me.
###1254 He'll take a deep breath and go, how is that even possible?
###1257 Because if a guy runs out of time for me, he just takes it.
###1261 But when a woman is feeling stressed,
###1263 your mechanism to lower stress is
###1266 to nurture others and release oxytocin.
###1270 Oxytocin, when you're giving to other people,
###1273 caring for others, being concerned for others,
###1276 doing for others-- not necessarily solving problems--
###1279 being in a social relationship, listening to someone,
###1282 helping them, whatever.
###1283 It's not so much solving problems as nurturing.
###1286 See, here's the difference between nurturing,
###1288 which is oxytocin-releasing, and problem solving
###1299 is testosterone-producing.
###1301 So my wife is a gardener.
###1302 When she's planting her seeds, when
###1304 she's caring for her seeds, that's nurturing.
###1308 When the irrigation system is broken,
###1311 and water is spurting up, that's solving a problem.
###1315 So you see how solving a problem is the illusion that I'll
###1318 solve it, and it's done forever.
###1320 And then, of course, they come back.
###1322 So men make great emergency workers.
###1325 A big problem comes, I'm going to solve it.
###1328 Then you feel like, ah, now I can rest.
###1330 Relax.
###1330 Forget about that.
###1332 But women are designed to not forget about things.
###1335 This is the big complaint men have,
###1337 is 30 years in-- I'll just do a funny story here.
###1340 My wife and I were in the Galapagos Islands.
###1342 You know, the Galapagos turtles live long lives.
###1346 There's a T-shirt they're selling there,
###1348 it's these two old turtles talking,
###1351 and the husband's saying to the female turtle, honey,
###1355 the affair was 97 years ago.
###1359 Can we let it go?
###1362 When she's under stress, all of her memories come up.
###1366 See, this is how women cope with stress
###1369 is talking about what's stressing you out.
###1372 So the memories come up.
###1373 Men cope with stress by forgetting those things.
###1376 Forget it.
###1377 Forget it.
###1377 So a woman's busy talking about stressful things,
###1380 and a man goes, just forget it.
###1382 Don't worry about it.
###1383 It's not a big deal.
###1384 Just do this and this and this.
###1385 Don't take that exit next time.
###1387 And the worst is the man will listen to you complaining
###1389 about your job, he'll say, just quit that job.
###1392 You can get another job.
###1394 As if you're going to say, gee, I hadn't thought of that.
###1398 What a brilliant idea.
###1399 No wonder I'm married to you.
###1400 You're so smart.
###1402 But, see, when a man hears a problem, he wants to kill it.
###1406 Basically, it's run from it or kill it.
###1408 Solve it.
###1409 Fix it.
###1409 Because that releases testosterone.
###1412 Then he relaxes.
###1414 For a woman, testosterone does not lower her cortisol levels.
###1420 It doesn't raise them.
###1422 It just doesn't lower them.
###1424 So what lowers stress levels for women is oxytocin.
###1430 Ah.
###1431 So now when you're in a personal relationship,
###1433 and you're nurturing others, you're releasing your oxytocin.
###1437 Your stress levels goes down.
###1439 But guess what?
###1440 Giving doesn't rebuild your oxytocin.
###1445 What rebuilds oxytocin so you have it to give
###1449 is when you feel you're receiving support.
###1452 So, for women, everything is about reciprocity.
###1455 It's I give, and I get back.
###1457 I give-- if you're my friend, I do something for you,
###1460 and now you're obligated to do something back.
###1463 If we're two girlfriends, and I call you up,
###1466 with the first thing I'll do is a woman
###1469 is say, tell me about your kids.
###1471 Or tell me about this.
###1472 It's like I remember everything about you,
###1474 and I ask lots of questions, get you talking,
###1476 and now you owe me five minutes of listening.
###1478 
###1481 Women can't believe when a guy will talk about himself
###1483 and then not ask her questions.
###1485 It's like, how can he just talk about himself?
###1487 And he's over here thinking, why does she have nothing to say?
###1491 Because women eagerly ask questions to draw somebody out
###1494 because they so much value being heard.
###1498 See me, hear me, touch me.
###1500 All of these things are oxytocin producers.
###1505 So that if you feel seen and heard,
###1507 and you feel backed up, if you're
###1508 part of a team-- and this is women in tribes.
###1510 Women have always been in tribes.
###1513 You go to indigenous cultures.
###1514 They're doing everything together, all the time.
###1517 And there's never any rushing, by the way.
###1520 There's a sense of support.
###1522 It's that you feel that you have support at all times.
###1524 It's not like you need that support all the time.
###1526 It's not I like you're this needy person.
###1528 It's just that you always have backup.
###1531 And so women, because their instinct is always
###1533 to be giving, because giving releases oxytocin,
###1536 and you have a rewards system to make you feel good.
###1539 Women are busy always giving, but if it's
###1541 all women you're working with, all day long, everybody's
###1544 giving, so everybody's receiving.
###1548 And suddenly, you take a women and put them in hand
###1550 with men, who don't live in that world.
###1553 Or in a corporate environment, it isn't structured that way.
###1557 See, the whole difference of Mars world and Venus world,
###1561 we have to blend them together.
###1563 One is not bad.
###1564 One's not better.
###1565 But to make sense of it, you look at the two worlds.
###1568 In the Mars world, the strong survive.
###1572 The better you are, the bigger result you get.
###1575 The harder you work, the smarter you are, the bigger result.
###1578 You get paid more.
###1579 Gee, he didn't get paid much, but look what you did.
###1581 You got more.
###1583 At home, in the personal world, the child who is the sickest
###1588 gets more.
###1590 They get more attention.
###1592 They get more help.
###1593 They get more support.
###1594 And everybody gets what they need.
###1596 It's not what you earn, it's what you need.
###1599 But you don't go into your boss and say, you know,
###1601 I really need that job.
###1604 Your chances of getting it go down.
###1606 It's like, I've earned this role.
###1608 Look what I've done.
###1608 I do this and this and this.
###1610 Therefore, I should get this reward.
###1612 These are two different worlds of thinking
###1615 that blend together, and this is the male female relationship,
###1618 which is a new experiment on planet Earth.
###1622 If you go to any the indigenous tribes--
###1624 we're talking thousands and thousands of years of history.
###1626 Go visit in Africa, you'll see two fires at night.
###1631 Women around one, men around another.
###1634 Go to the Amazon.
###1635 I was just in your Google Maps area
###1638 where you can see the whole world,
###1639 and I was going all these places I've been.
###1642 Go down to the Amazon.
###1643 Go to the Amazon.
###1644 You'll see, at night, men are sitting around.
###1647 Women are behind a wall, and they're
###1649 all busy with the children and cooking and cleaning and making
###1653 alcoholic beverages to give to the men.
###1656 How do they make those alcoholic beverages?
###1658 Just little trivia here.
###1659 They chew these roots.
###1662 They masticate them, chew them, and spit them
###1665 into this bowl with a little heat under it.
###1668 And if they go for three or four days,
###1670 it becomes very alcoholic.
###1672 So the men are all just sitting around.
###1673 The women come out with their bowls
###1675 occasionally and hand it to their husbands.
###1676 And there I am with the chief, so the chief's wife
###1679 gave me his bowl.
###1680 It was this big on-- just tasted terrible.
###1683 
###1687 That chief, by the way, [INAUDIBLE] chief,
###1689 he was also very proud of his seven shrunken heads.
###1693 They do exist.
###1694 And through my two translators asking him, why do you do that?
###1699 He says, oh, very clear.
###1701 I have seven children.
###1703 I said, well, explain that to me.
###1705 He says, well, the jungle only has so much food,
###1707 and you can only get so much from your grocery store.
###1711 And if you're going to bring a child into this world,
###1713 you have to eliminate somebody from a neighboring tribe.
###1717 Otherwise, there will be a shortage of food.
###1719 That was their sustainability program.
###1722 I think we've come a long way.
###1725 It's tribal thinking versus global consciousness.
###1729 Now we're moving into the world where
###1730 if I hurt someone out there, I'm hurting myself.
###1733 And the history of tribal consciousness
###1735 is I don't care about them.
###1737 I care about my children.
###1738 That's a mafia family.
###1739 Mafia fathers are very loving to their kids
###1741 as long as they say yes, but not to anybody else.
###1746 So this, we're trying to get out to see,
###1748 and that's the experience of the heart opening.
###1750 And, ultimately, this happens through this great experiment
###1753 of romance, men and women coming together
###1755 in romantic relationships.
###1758 You seek out, you find someone that your heart opens to.
###1761 And can you keep your heart open to the same person who's
###1765 not perfect?
###1766 Say, for the first three years, it
###1768 seems as though they're perfect, and then reality sets in.
###1772 And reality sets in because when you meet someone new,
###1776 and there's sexual attraction, your brain
###1779 produces massive amounts of dopamine.
###1782 How many are familiar with the term dopamine?
###1785 That's when you're driving your car fast.
###1787 That's when you're really focused on a project.
###1788 That's when you're getting a reward.
###1790 That's when there's danger.
###1791 That's when there's sex.
###1792 That's when you're doing-- any addictive substances goes
###1798 into the nucleus accumbens, where dopamine
###1800 produces lots of pleasure.
###1802 So anything that's pleasurable for you is producing dopamine.
###1804 
###1807 So in the first three years, one of
###1809 the major dopamine simulators is newness.
###1814 Newness stimulates dopamine.
###1816 Now, what is the opposite of newness?
###1819 Not newness.
###1821 And what happens after three years?
###1823 It's not new.
###1824 And then to make things worse, when
###1826 you have an argument, what does she generally do?
###1829 She brings up the past.
###1831 So there's definitely not new.
###1833 It's the worst thing couples can do.
###1835 And I'm not putting it on her, because she'll start it,
###1837 but then he'll come back, and now he'll
###1838 start going into the past, too.
###1841 And now you're both living in the past.
###1843 As soon as you can't be in present time,
###1845 dopamine levels start decreasing, decreasing,
###1848 decreasing.
###1848 All that passion you felt in the beginning
###1851 dissipates after three years unless you
###1854 have relationship skills.
###1856 You have to understand the software.
###1858 With so many of you into software--
###1859 that's how I got into this whole relationship thing.
###1861 I used to work as a programmer back
###1863 in the days of Stanford Research Institute and COBOL.
###1867 So I used to program the computers.
###1869 At a certain point, I realized I should program people.
###1872 So I had that very analytical perspective
###1873 that men are like this, women are like this.
###1875 If we do this, then this.
###1877 If we do this, then that.
###1878 And we can see it predictively.
###1880 A man comes home-- he doesn't know anything
###1882 about men and women differences-- he
###1884 says, hi, honey.
###1885 And he goes and sits down and reads a book.
###1887 And she's going, is that it?
###1890 He used to be excited to see me.
###1891 Matter of fact, what she'll do if they're married in a house
###1894 is he comes home, she'll test them.
###1896 She'll go to another part of the house and wonder,
###1900 does he even miss me?
###1900 Does he care about me?
###1902 She's playing hide ad seek, Venusian hide and seek.
###1904 I'm hiding, and you're supposed to find me.
###1907 So she's going, I could be dead, and he wouldn't even care.
###1910 And he's from Mars-- he has his own little hide and seek.
###1913 Men come home-- he goes, she's not around.
###1915 Good.
###1916 
###1918 He just wants to be alone, no interference, nobody calling
###1922 on, nobody asking for anything.
###1923 Just give me a break for a while.
###1925 So he's playing hide and go seek,
###1926 but the rules are, don't find me.
###1928 He doesn't want to be found.
###1929 She wants to be found.
###1933 Men solve problems to feel better and then forget them.
###1936 The easiest way to solve a problem is forget it.
###1939 Manana.
###1939 Tomorrow.
###1940 I don't have to deal with it now.
###1941 And that's what we're trying to help you with,
###1943 but it doesn't work for her.
###1945 And she'll be talking about things
###1947 and just blows him out of the water.
###1949 He goes, oh, my gosh.
###1951 I'll make $1 million on a book.
###1953 We'll be doing a bunch of fun stuff together.
###1955 I'll come home one day a week later,
###1957 and I'll leave a glass out on the counter.
###1960 And she'll lose it and go, ugh, is it
###1964 that hard to put your glass this far over to here
###1969 and put in the dishwasher?
###1970 I mean, can't you at least put it there?
###1972 And I'm like, what is she, nuts or something?
###1977 We're, like, the luckiest people in the world.
###1979 We're having an argument over a glass, which is right here?
###1982 How could she do that?
###1984 But when you understand her world-- and part
###1986 of the craziness, from my perspective,
###1987 is two days before, it was a big bunch
###1990 of all these dishes were everywhere.
###1991 It was piling up and piling up.
###1993 It was some party we had, and nothing
###1994 had been done for a couple days.
###1996 So she had spent much of the day cleaning up.
###1999 So it was completely clear-- so you have to imagine this.
###2001 You've been living with trash, and women
###2003 see this 10 times more than men.
###2004 They actually have more cells in their eyes.
###2006 They see it.
###2007 They can't ignore it.
###2007 Guy comes home.
###2008 He sees his TV set.
###2009 That's it.
###2010 Doesn't see anything.
###2011 She sees everything, and it's hard to relax
###2014 if it's not in order, organized.
###2017 So here it is.
###2017 It's been cleaned up.
###2019 She spent all day cleaning it up.
###2021 And from her point, can't there just
###2023 be a moment where it stays so pretty and nice?
###2027 So it just triggered a button.
###2028 She had an emotional reaction.
###2030 And when women have emotional reactions, see,
###2032 men think that that emotional reaction is just
###2034 about the glass.
###2036 But it's never about just the first thing she talks about.
###2039 That's just the warm up.
###2040 That's the foreplay for the big story that's about to come.
###2044 She's got all kinds of things that are bothering her
###2046 that have been building up.
###2047 It's like, for women, it's like the straw that
###2050 breaks the camel's back.
###2052 Women hold this stress up, this stress up, this stress up.
###2055 And finally something happens, and it starts to come out.
###2059 And when it comes out, a guy thinks you're nuts.
###2061 But here's a way to help, , again interpret each other
###2064 correctly.
###2064 She's not nuts at all.
###2065 It's just that she has a greater need
###2067 to talk about what's bothering her.
###2070 Men have a greater need to forget what's bothering them.
###2073 So our job is to forget about it.
###2076 Her job is to talk about it.
###2080 So here's a little difference.
###2081 We come into some physiology.
###2084 The emotional part of the brain called
###2085 the limbic system is twice as big in a woman than a man.
###2089 Big difference.
###2090 Twice as big.
###2092 Under moderate stress, a woman will experience eight times
###2096 more blood flow to the emotional part of the brain.
###2100 Under moderate stress.
###2101 Under extreme stress, a man will experience that blood flow,
###2106 but the problem has to be really big.
###2109 Women will experience an emotional reaction
###2111 to small problems.
###2113 And so a man misinterprets her emotional reaction
###2116 as if she's saying the problem is big,
###2118 and she doesn't know what to do about it.
###2120 So we're constantly seeing women, when they get emotional,
###2123 it's like, what, she can't handle that?
###2124 She's not saying, I can't handle that.
###2126 She's just having an emotional response to it
###2129 as a way to let go of stress.
###2131 And man's way to let go stress is
###2134 to detach, to separate from his emotions.
###2137 And you can see this in brain scans.
###2139 The amygdala in a man is wired up
###2141 to go right to the part of the brain-- fight or flight
###2144 is the amygdala-- into solving the problem.
###2147 You know what Freud did-- it totally
###2148 different from modern therapy.
###2151 90% of the people who see modern therapists are women.
###2155 Why?
###2156 It's changed.
###2157 It's eye contact.
###2159 It's how do you feel?
###2160 How do you feel?
###2161 What else do you feel?
###2162 What else happened?
###2163 How does that make you feel?
###2164 It's all this personal nurturing interaction.
###2168 Freud did none of that.
###2169 He had mostly men.
###2171 You go into a dark room where you had no eye contact.
###2173 You lie down on a couch, which every man loves to do.
###2176 He'd sit behind you, and all he would do is take notes.
###2181 He'd ask you questions.
###2183 And you would solve problems.
###2184 Why do you think this?
###2185 And why you think that?
###2186 And why do you think this?
###2188 He could have just been saying, and what is 23 times 17?
###2192 And you would have to calculate these problems.
###2194 Just solving problems and relaxing lowers a man's stress.
###2199 It wasn't some big, magical thing.
###2201 But for women, it did nothing.
###2203 So, gradually, it evolved for women.
###2205 And usually it was just very wealthy men
###2207 they did therapy, because once you're a man,
###2210 and you have lots of wealth, you go crazy.
###2213 Why?
###2215 And by crazy, I mean, look at the "National Enquirer"
###2217 and see all the wealthy superstar people.
###2220 They get divorced.
###2221 They have battles.
###2222 They take drugs.
###2223 They're going through rehab.
###2224 What's going on is that they don't have to work anymore.
###2228 These are men who don't have to work,
###2231 so they get to do what they like to do.
###2234 When you do what you like to do, oxytocin gets produced.
###2238 Oxytocin doesn't lower stress in men.
###2241 Doing anything that women like to do
###2243 does not lower stress in men.
###2246 That's why in the beginning, men are
###2247 so happy to do things with you.
###2249 And after a while, they're ready to sit on the couch.
###2251 And what you'll say to them things like,
###2253 hey, what would you like to do?
###2254 He'll say, I'd like to just sit here and have you make me
###2257 dinner.
###2258 Or you might want to go out to dinner tonight,
###2262 and you say to him, hey, John, would you
###2264 like to go out to dinner tonight?
###2265 And what does every woman interpret that to mean?
###2268 What she's really saying is, I'd like
###2270 to go out to dinner tonight.
###2271 Wouldn't you like to go out to dinner?
###2272 Let's go out to dinner tonight.
###2273 But she doesn't say that.
###2275 She says, hey, John, would you like
###2277 to go out to dinner tonight?
###2279 If he's not initiated into the Venusian language-- which
###2282 is very convoluted and changing all the time,
###2284 depending on her mood-- would you
###2287 like to go out to dinner tonight?
###2288 No, I'd rather just stay home.
###2290 You could make me this dinner.
###2292 Because he actually thinks you're
###2294 asking what he'd like to do.
###2295 
###2301 The flip side of this is Friday night comes along.
###2305 And this is where we have this experiment of romance.
###2307 Marriage is based upon love and affection and romance,
###2310 which is magnificent.
###2312 I've been married to my wife 28 years.
###2314 To experience passion with somebody that you know,
###2319 it's like a miraculous experience.
###2321 Very few people have ever experienced it.
###2323 They have to have somebody new, somebody different.
###2325 To actually experience passion with somebody you know.
###2329 It was like seven years into our marriage
###2331 is when I woke up to how great my life was.
###2334 Not that I wasn't having a good time,
###2335 but making love with my wife, it was fireworks.
###2340 It was spectacular.
###2341 It was one of those times where, afterward, you
###2343 just laugh at how fantastic it was.
###2345 And I said to her, wow, that was as good
###2349 as it was in the beginning.
###2350 And she goes, oh, that was better.
###2352 I said, what do you mean?
###2354 She says, well, in the beginning, the sex was great,
###2356 but you didn't really know me.
###2359 Now, you've seen the best of me, and you've
###2362 seen the worst of me, and you still love and adore me.
###2366 That's real love.
###2368 That's real love.
###2369 In the beginning, its a glimpse of what it feels like.
###2372 It's the brain chemicals of love.
###2373 But you don't even know who you're reacting to.
###2375 It's mostly fantasy.
###2376 In order to keep your heart open,
###2378 we need to have these advanced communication insights.
###2382 Because what do you do?
###2383 If a guy needs to go to his cave--
###2385 one of the big insights of "Men Are from Mars"--
###2387 now it's pretty much gone into the culture.
###2389 Man cave.
###2391 He needs his man cave.
###2392 He goes to his man cave, except men typically don't come out.
###2398 So I teach women how to bring him out of the man cave.
###2400 He's got to have that, but he also
###2402 needs a little incentive to come out.
###2404 If you say to him, what would you like for dinner tonight,
###2406 or what would you like to do?
###2408 He'll say, just sit in my man cave
###2409 and continue doing what I'm doing, as opposed to you
###2412 have to know what you'd like, what you want,
###2414 learning how to ask for support.
###2416 These are all like new skills.
###2417 Women have never had to do that in the past.
###2420 And for thousands and thousands of years
###2422 in indigenous cultures, women don't ask men for anything.
###2424 They don't even talk to men.
###2426 Men learned a man's role from his father.
###2429 Women learned to do from mother.
###2430 That was it.
###2432 There's very little connection and communication.
###2435 So it's learning to take the time that we need.
###2439 And for men, it's often alone time,
###2441 and for women, it's connection time.
###2443 If you want to keep the connection open with a man,
###2446 and you want to keep him connected to you,
###2448 your role is to, in a sense, draw him out.
###2451 And one of the best metaphors for this
###2454 is when I was going to places in indigenous India.
###2457 You go to these temples that are 5,000-year-old temple,
###2460 and you'll see all around the temple,
###2462 men are sitting in meditation, not the women at the spa.
###2465 Men are all sitting in meditation, because they can
###2467 more quickly-- it's not automatic,
###2469 but a man has the ability to shut the world out,
###2472 and that is the most powerful way for him
###2474 to rebuild his testosterone and regenerate his body.
###2477 So men are all meditating at the temple,
###2479 and women are all dancing around naked with little bells
###2481 in their waist.
###2483 And their job?
###2484 To get men out of meditation.
###2486 You're supposed to draw us out of the cave.
###2488 Their whole mythology is Shiva would meditate
###2492 10,000 years or a million years or whatever,
###2494 and his wife has to dance around him until finally they
###2497 make love and create the world.
###2499 But it's the woman that draws the man out.
###2501 And women today, they don't even care about drawing the man out.
###2505 They just like going on with their life,
###2506 and then they misinterpret he's sitting in his cave.
###2509 What you start to think is, well, he doesn't love me.
###2512 He didn't used to go to the cave before.
###2514 And that's because he had the newness in the relationship
###2517 that would produce huge amounts of dopamine,
###2520 and then that produces testosterone,
###2521 so he wasn't needing to rebuild it as much.
###2524 So now you're in the relationship.
###2526 He's taking more time away.
###2528 He doesn't have that same attraction to you
###2530 he had before.
###2530 He's starting to pull away.
###2532 And women go, oh, I have to get it back.
###2533 I have to get back.
###2534 And you run after him, and he runs away more.
###2539 That was one of the big themes in "Men Are from Mars,
###2541 Women Are from Venus" is men are like rubber bands.
###2546 They want to get close to you, and then they pull out.
###2550 When they pull out, like a rubber band, they stretch.
###2555 And when it reaches its length of how much space do I need,
###2558 then he springs back, and he falls in love with you again.
###2562 And then he pulls away-- he misses you--
###2565 and he springs back.
###2567 Now, I'm going to go on a trip to China next week
###2570 or so for three weeks.
###2572 I haven't been away from my wife in eight years for three weeks.
###2576 But what I know is I'll have the best sex of my life
###2579 when I come home.
###2580 That other time I was on a tour for three weeks,
###2582 and it was the best sex of my life then.
###2585 Why?
###2585 Because I have pulled back.
###2588 And when I pull back, I have a chance to miss her.
###2590 I have a chance to rebuild my focus on her.
###2592 I have a chance for my testosterone levels to rise.
###2595 And when I come back, it will just be super stud land.
###2598 I'm really looking forward to it much more
###2600 than how much I'm getting paid, which is a lot as well.
###2604 But that is really an exciting thing.
###2606 So when men pull away, they spring back like a rubber band.
###2609 And then once they're in, the rubber band gets soft.
###2615 It's just a metaphor for sex.
###2617 Imagine a man just went in and stayed.
###2620 You'd be wanting to push him away.
###2622 He pulls out.
###2622 He goes in.
###2623 He pulls out.
###2624 He goes in.
###2624 It's that dance of coming closer, pulling apart.
###2627 And that's his role to go in and pull back.
###2629 He has the hormones for it.
###2631 Testosterone is the in and out urge.
###2634 This is testosterone.
###2636 When women don't understand the hormonal differences
###2638 between men, when he pulls away, what do you do?
###2643 You run after him.
###2645 And so if you're running after him,
###2647 does that rubber band ever get to stretch?
###2649 And how do you run after him?
###2650 I go into all the details in the books, but you say,
###2653 what's the matter?
###2654 Is there something wrong?
###2656 Or let me do something for you.
###2657 Or let's do this together.
###2659 Or what would you like to do?
###2661 And now you're concerned about him.
###2663 When he pulls away, that's when you
###2665 have to come back to being self-sufficient, self-reliant.
###2668 I have a life, and you're lucky to be part of it.
###2673 If you can stand in your place without getting insecure
###2675 and running after him, that causes
###2678 him to want to come back.
###2679 Because, see, men really need women to be happier.
###2683 We can only get to a certain level of happiness.
###2687 Then we have to be able to make a woman happy to take us
###2689 to a higher level.
###2691 The illusion we all have as men--
###2693 we get caught in this trap-- is that we
###2695 think we can make her happy.
###2697 You can't make a woman happy.
###2699 You can only make a woman happier.
###2703 You're not responsible for her happiness.
###2705 Because in the beginning, all that newness
###2707 stimulates huge amounts of dopamine,
###2709 just like winning the lottery, just like superhero.
###2712 That's why they call heroin, heroin.
###2714 You get to be a hero and sit down and do nothing.
###2717 It makes you feel like a hero.
###2718 A woman makes you feel like a hero, makes you feel fantastic.
###2722 Look what I did.
###2723 She's so happy.
###2725 The problem is, when you take credit
###2726 for all of her happiness, when she's not happy,
###2728 look what you feel.
###2730 You feel like you've failed.
###2731 You shut down.
###2732 You get bent out of shape.
###2734 You get pouty.
###2735 You get feminine.
###2737 See, what people don't understand
###2739 is this feminization of men is when
###2740 men become all negative emotions.
###2744 If you're in your masculine side,
###2745 you have healthy testosterone, you don't get afraid.
###2750 You don't get angry.
###2752 You don't cry unless the problem is really big,
###2754 and there's nothing you can do about it, like grieving a loss.
###2758 There's places for feelings but not in arguments.
###2762 Men used to be taught this stuff, how
###2764 to endure pain without talking about it.
###2767 In initiation for an American Indian,
###2770 they'd stick sticks through the breast
###2772 in front of the whole village at 13 years old.
###2774 They'd tie ropes to it and slowly raise you.
###2777 Throw the rope over a limb, slowly raise you in the air,
###2780 and you hang there the whole day.
###2783 And you're not allowed to cry out.
###2785 You have to learn to deal with that pain.
###2787 You have to contain it inside yourself.
###2790 And now do we need these initiations today?
###2792 No.
###2793 We have a more advanced initiation.
###2794 Try listening to your wife without saying anything
###2797 for 10 minutes.
###2799 Without reacting back.
###2801 See, you have to learn as men how
###2803 to contain the female side of you
###2805 inside and not become a female and start
###2807 whining and complaining back.
###2810 This destroys marriages.
###2811 A woman will complain.
###2813 A man has 10 more back.
###2815 He says, I can beat that.
###2816 I'm a man.
###2816 I got testosterone.
###2817 I can do more.
###2819 And now you get this little tit for tat argument.
###2821 Nobody's taught men today.
###2822 You don't do that.
###2823 That's not what men do.
###2824 What women need most is to feel heard,
###2826 and then a magic trick happens.
###2829 She feels better, and nothing has changed.
###2832 This is like a revelation.
###2833 I have women coming into my office so unhappy,
###2835 and when they leave, they're so happy.
###2837 And after a while, I point out, do
###2838 you realize that you come to my office unhappy,
###2840 and you leave happy, and nothing has changed?
###2844 Nothing has changed in your life.
###2845 It's all inside ourselves how we look at the world.
###2848 As a couple, men can learn how to support a woman.
###2851 Women can learn how to receive that support.
###2854 That's the whole new dance, is women learning,
###2856 how do I motivate him to give me the support I need?
###2859 Because he wants to do it, but it's very hard to start.
###2862 When he goes to his cave, you misinterpret,
###2865 thinking, he must not love me.
###2867 So how can you go and ask for support
###2869 to somebody you think doesn't love you?
###2871 Or ask for help around the house?
###2873 Women need way more help.
###2874 How can you ask?
###2875 You look at him with eyes of resentment.
###2877 Aren't you helping?
###2878 Aren't you joining in?
###2879 Why aren't you helping me?
###2880 Well, he needs a job description,
###2882 and he needs to be paid.
###2884 Paid is your happiness.
###2886 So let's say you need him to do something.
###2888 Would you move that box?
###2889 And it's the third time you've asked him.
###2891 He moves the box, and you glare at him,
###2893 like, finally you did it.
###2894 As opposed to, oh, you moved the box.
###2896 Then, next, you're training him to do little things
###2901 to make you happy.
###2902 Because in a man's mind, big things
###2904 make you happy, not little things.
###2907 He's dating you.
###2907 He's only doing little stuff.
###2909 And he figures if little stuff makes you happy,
###2911 wait until I do the big stuff like commitment,
###2914 and marriage, or sharing my income.
###2917 That's the big stuff.
###2918 Then I don't need to do the little stuff.
###2921 But it's the little stuff that actually
###2922 generates the oxytocin.
###2924 So if I give one rose to a woman,
###2927 she gets a surge of oxytocin.
###2930 If I give her 24 roses, in my mind, that's at least 24
###2933 surges, right?
###2935 No.
###2935 It's just the same surge.
###2937 So think of it in terms of points.
###2939 In a man's mind, I'm giving her 24 roses, 36 roses.
###2942 That 36 points.
###2943 That should last me half the year.
###2946 It's one point.
###2948 And why are roses so symbolic of romance?
###2950 Because they die in a week.
###2952 You have to keep nurturing it.
###2953 You have to keep nurturing it.
###2956 So once men understand this stuff,
###2958 women are not so complicated.
###2959 It's easier to make the relationship work.
###2961 But it is an art.
###2963 It is like learning a new program.
###2966 It's a new system.
###2966 And once you learn the new system, it's really easy.
###2969 But when you turn over to a new system,
###2971 it's really hard for a while.
###2972 That's what we're going through right now.
###2974 So we have about 10 minutes for questions and answers.
###2976 I see one right over here.
###2977 Go right ahead.
###2978 AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?
###2979 JOHN GRAY: OK.
###2980 So you'd like to know how women sabotage communication at work?
###2982 Because that is probably one of the things
###2984 that I write about in "Work with Me."
###2988 I have 10 minutes to talk, so I'll give you
###2990 one way women sabotage communication at work
###2993 is they simply use the phrase, Bob, could you do this for me?
###2999 And Bob will say, sure, and then forget to do it.
###3003 And you'll think, how could he forget?
###3005 And this is something you experiment with this week.
###3009 Instead of using, could you do this?
###3011 Can you do this?
###3011 Say, Bob, would you do this for me?
###3015 And you'll see he will remember to do it.
###3017 It's linguistics.
###3018 If you say would, a man feels he's making a promise.
###3022 If you say, could you do it?
###3023 Yeah, I could do it.
###3024 It doesn't even go into the front part of his brain.
###3026 It literally doesn't go there.
###3028 The next one, another way is not giving enough feedback to a man
###3033 that you value him.
###3034 Because women just assume that if you're interacting with him,
###3038 he must feel valued.
###3039 So one of the ways a woman can communicate value to man,
###3041 that you value him-- three phrases.
###3044 You start doing this this week, you'll
###3045 see a huge difference in the men you work with.
###3048 He's talking.
###3048 When he pauses, say, that makes sense.
###3052 And just brighten up, like, that makes sense.
###3055 You'll see.
###3055 He'll take a double take.
###3056 What did I say?
###3057 Somebody acknowledged I make sense.
###3059 That makes sense.
###3060 Another one is, with a little female enthusiasm, good idea.
###3064 You'll see his mood will changed.
###3066 And at least a couple times a week, go, brilliant.
###3069 He says, yes, yes.
###3070 What else can I do for you?
###3072 Now, I know the flip side of this-- how do men sabotage?
###3075 Well, I'll do a couple on men, which
###3077 is how men could sabotage relationships in the workplace.
###3079 Same thing at home, which is, ask more questions.
###3082 Whenever you think you're ready to give a solution or a point
###3084 of view, ask another question.
###3086 If you show interest in a woman's point of view,
###3089 you start building a bond of trust,
###3092 as opposed to just being interested
###3093 in solving the problem.
###3095 Men are just interested in solving the problem.
###3098 But if you can just ask another question,
###3100 it take your interest into her point of view
###3103 if a man can ask that extra question.
###3105 Here is the next one, as a male manager, particularly,
###3108 but working on a team with women.
###3110 When there's a problem, and a woman's presenting the problem,
###3113 don't immediately give what you think is the answer.
###3116 Instead, pause, and say to her, and what
###3120 do you think we should do about this?
###3122 And listen to her answer.
###3124 Because so much of the time, men just--
###3126 if you talk about a problem, men jump in there
###3128 with 30 times more testosterone, which
###3130 gives you faster reaction time.
###3132 I got the answer!
###3133 I'll solve that problem.
###3134 And he doesn't realize that you have the answer, too.
###3137 So you're sabotaging your success
###3140 by not letting him know you have an answer-- that
###3142 would be another topic on how women sabotage-- but men
###3144 sabotage building trust and a sense of cooperation
###3148 when they're working with women by jumping in with solutions,
###3151 rather than asking a few questions first.
###3154 But, for men, it's like playing basketball.
###3156 I want to grab the ball and dunk it myself.
###3159 Women are all, on a certain level,
###3160 let's all take turns, and let's all take credit together.
###3162 We're a team.
###3163 We did it all ourselves.
###3165 And a man's over here, but I did this.
###3167 Anyway, a lot on that.
###3168 That's from the book "Work with Me."
###3170 Well, I'm asking the question where
###3171 you hear I mentioned I had a study of 100,000 men
###3174 and women that we took their evidence
###3176 right from the book, which is another one of the blind spots
###3180 was the number one complaint women have--
###3183 we asked this question, it just happened to be the highest
###3185 one-- is, do you experience that men listen to you?
###3191 And over 70% of women said men don't listen.
###3195 They asked the men, do men listen to women?
###3200 And 90% of the men said, of course.
###3204 So in his world, he's listening, but in her world,
###3208 she doesn't feel heard.
###3209 That's a gap.
###3210 And, yes, we've done the research on that.
###3213 I did that book just because people
###3214 would say what you just said.
###3215 Well, where's your research on this?
###3217 I probably talked to more people about relationships
###3220 than anybody in history, than the whole planet
###3223 history of the world.
###3224 That's all I do is talk to people
###3226 about relationship experiences.
###3228 Not in a scientific study with 18 men and women,
###3231 with thousands of people, with 50 people, again and again
###3235 and again.
###3235 And what I see is these themes.
###3237 But I wrote that book just so people
###3239 who like to look at the digits could actually see the digits
###3242 and how many women truly see the world through different eyes.
###3245 But I appreciate the comment.
###3247 It's a force that we have to overcome,
###3250 because there's a huge force which
###3253 wants to say we should all be the same.
###3257 We should all think the same.
###3258 We should all react the same.
###3260 And if we can all just become one,
###3262 then the world will be a better place.
###3264 It will be fairer for people.
###3266 It'll be fairer for people.
###3268 We'll be able to appreciate our differences,
###3271 appreciate our different strengths,
###3273 and create room for people to be different.
###3275 That is what will make this world a better place.
###3279 Yeah, women have a lot more adrenaline going on than men.
###3281 What happens with adrenaline is adrenaline
###3284 is produced from dopamine.
###3286 So I'll give you an example you can relate to.
###3288 As a man, you're driving a car around 80 miles an hour,
###3291 you feel very relaxed, right?
###3293 Easy going.
###3294 And then you hit it up-- there's a certain point between 80
###3296 and 120 where most men will start to feel the adrenaline.
###3300 It's like, rrrr.
###3301 There's like this rrrr energy inside.
###3304 That's the shifting of dopamine, which you're confident,
###3307 you're capable, you're online.
###3309 That's dopamine.
###3310 Lots of testosterone being produced.
###3312 Now your concerns start to increase.
###3315 That a dropping of your serotonin, your optimism.
###3318 You're starting to think of what could go wrong.
###3320 That's serotonin dropping.
###3322 So when your serotonin levels start to drop,
###3324 your dopamine converts into adrenaline.
###3327 And adrenaline gives you even more ability to react fast,
###3331 so you get spikes in testosterone at that point,
###3334 maybe 10 times more.
###3335 But then you deplete, so then you
###3338 need more recovery time afterwards.
###3341 And this is all about how much adrenaline gets produced.
###3343 For women, your vulnerability in your brain
###3346 is that because your limbic system is so much more
###3348 active than men's, you tend to run out
###3350 of serotonin much faster than men.
###3352 This is why women have depression
###3354 four times more than men.
###3357 They run out of serotonin faster under moderate stress
###3360 as opposed to men.
###3362 Canadian research shows that men actually
###3364 make serotonin 50% more efficiently.
###3366 That's because we have more muscle mass.
###3368 Men store 50% more of residue serotonin, which is probably
###3373 an evolutionary development, because you're in danger.
###3375 Your life is in danger, and you have
###3377 to stay cool, calm, and collected
###3379 to prevent your dopamine from converting into adrenaline.
###3382 But adrenaline, particularly, once you feel adrenalin,
###3385 as a man, you really need to physically move your body.
###3388 If you don't burn the adrenalin off
###3390 through physical movement of the muscles, then what occurs
###3394 is cortisol levels will start to rise.
###3396 And cortisol levels don't go away very quickly.
###3399 Adrenaline can burn off like that.
###3401 But once your cortisol levels rise, it's sort of a slow rise,
###3404 and it stays in there.
###3405 It's the worst thing for your health.
###3407 Cortisol inhibits digestion, inhibits your immune system,
###3410 inhibits your detoxification system, causes brain injury.
###3414 All those things are directly related
###3416 to chronically elevated cortisol levels.
###3418 And this is the world that's happening for women today.
###3422 So women's health issues are dropping down.
###3424 More women have heart attacks than men today.
###3426 And this can all be remedied-- not
###3429 by saying women should be home.
###3431 It's by saying women should have a balanced personal life where
###3434 they schedule their lives so that they're
###3436 doing their testosterone stimulating activities balanced
###3440 by personal, fulfilling, home experiences in a personal life
###3446 to balance the work life.
###3447 And it's understanding all those dynamics
###3450 of what creates oxytocin in your body
###3453 because our world has become way too testosterone oriented.
###3456 And ultimately, for men, love is very important to men, as well.
###3461 And if he comes home, and a woman can't be loving,
###3463 then you get a man who doesn't come out of his cave.
###3465 So there's a huge balance and upset.
###3469 So many of the problems we experience today
###3472 with all of the mass shootings and all that stuff that's
###3474 going on.
###3475 We see the kids going and shooting people.
###3477 These kids are always on antidepressants
###3479 or antipsychotics.
###3481 They're always on drugs.
###3482 Since we started using drugs for mental illness,
###3485 there's now, since 1980, 35 times more mental illness
###3489 in America.
###3490 35 times more.
###3492 People, once they start taking medications, don't go off.
###3496 They do not heal the brain.
###3497 They change the brain, and the brain-- the problem
###3500 goes worse and worse.
###3501 That whole story is written in my most recent book, which
###3506 you can all get a free-- for right now--
###3508 free pre-publication copy, just doing
###3511 a free download at marsvenus.com.
###3513 It's called the "Mars Venus Wellness Solution for Focus,"
###3518 So focus is-- the challenge for our children
###3520 today is one out of five boys with ADHD being drugged.
###3526 And what parents don't realize is
###3528 ADHD drugs cause stunted growth for young children.
###3531 They cause heart disease.
###3533 Some of them are against the law in Canada,
###3534 because actually you get heart attacks from it.
###3536 But long before heart attacks, you're
###3538 getting arteriosclerosis.
###3539 It also causes brain changes that
###3541 don't disappear as teenagers but just turn into addictions
###3544 to caffeine, addictions to internet porn,
###3548 and the inability to commit to a long-term relationship.
###3551 These are all the more adult stages of ADD and ADHD.
###3556 And in the new book, I map at every stage of life
###3558 how, when we get ADHD as children,
###3561 and what causes it-- which they all
###3562 say we don't know-- we do know.
###3564 It's all there in all the literature.
###3566 I just quote PubMed again and again, all the causes
###3569 of ADHD, the rampant imbalance today.
###3572 And as we move through stages of life,
###3574 people don't recognize as your brain develops,
###3577 ADHD turns into something else.
###3579 One of the consistent ingredients that goes along
###3582 with ADHD in an autistic child, Asperger's child,
###3586 ADHD child is dramatically low glutathione levels in the body.
###3591 Glutathione protects the brain from brain energy
###3593 or free radical damage.
###3595 In all those cases, dramatically low glutathione levels.
###3600 Every person who has dementia and Alzheimer's-- it is now
###3603 predicted that one out of three people over 70 will have
###3605 dementia and Alzheimer's.
###3607 My younger sister has Alzheimer's.
###3609 My older brother has dementia and early stages
###3611 of Alzheimer's.
###3612 This is becoming another rampant epidemic in America.
###3616 The cause is so clear.
###3617 They keep saying we don't know the cause.
###3619 Go right to the physiology, and you'll
###3622 find that-- I can't go into all the causes.
###3624 That's a whole other book-- but I talk about the causes.
###3627 I talk about the remedies, natural remedies.
###3630 But natural remedies don't work if you
###3632 don't eliminate the causes.
###3634 Say you have a headache, and I actually
###3636 have a natural pill that will take away your headache-- which
###3638 I don't, by the way-- but if I had a pill
###3640 to give you to take away your headache,
###3642 but you keep hitting yourself in the head with a hammer,
###3645 will that pill work?
###3647 No.
###3647 But for people that don't hit themselves
###3649 in the head with a hammer, it will work.
###3652 Well, there are 10,000 studies on natural solutions for ADD
###3657 and ADHD all over the place.
###3658 They just don't work all the time,
###3660 as drugs don't work, because people don't know,
###3663 how am I creating this every day by my lifestyle choices
###3666 and decisions?
###3667 So, anyway, more on that subject is at marsvenus.com.
###3670 Just get a free download of the book.
###3674 For now, it's free.
###3675 Soon it will be on Amazon.
###3676 You can order it and buy it, but it's an easy read.
###3679 And, particularly, as a techie, for some techie guys here--
###3684 because they don't realize that they have huge amounts of ADD,
###3686 because they think, I have no problem focusing.
###3688 I can focus on my computer for 10 hours.
###3691 And I remember talking to one of the world's experts on ADHD,
###3694 and I looked at him, and I said, you know, you have ADHD.
###3697 He said, that's ridiculous.
###3698 I have total focus.
###3700 I'm so focused, my wife can talk to me,
###3702 and I don't hear a word she says while I'm
###3703 thinking about something.
###3705 That's also ADHD.
###3707 That's a problem with attention where
###3709 you can't shift your attention here,
###3711 but you become overly focused on one thing.
###3713 And I'll finished my talk by talking
###3715 about how ADD is creating huge problems in relationships
###3718 today, is that it causes men to become hyperfocused
###3722 on one thing.
###3723 In the beginning, they can be hyperfocused on her,
###3725 but once the newness goes away, he
###3727 becomes hyperfocused on his work,
###3730 and he doesn't take the time to rebuild his testosterone.
###3734 The average for a man at 50 has half the testosterone levels
###3737 he had as a younger man.
###3738 I have 25% more.
###3741 And I know exactly how I did it.
###3742 I explain it in my books, so I'll live a long, healthy life.
###3745 This is why men die, is their testosterone levels
###3747 start dropping.
###3747 Dopamine levels drop.
###3749 But, anyway, focus-- for men, they become hyperfocused.
###3752 And for women, they become hyperfocused on the things that
###3755 would, theoretically, release oxytocin-- other people's
###3759 needs.
###3759 So they're overwhelmed.
###3761 So overwhelm, the adult symptom of ADHD, is so common in women,
###3766 it's unbelievable.
###3767 It's like, I have no time for me.
###3769 I have to do this for this person.
###3770 Who says?
###3772 It's your brain taking on more than you can do.
###3774 This is ADHD.
###3776 And it can be corrected.
###3778 These are simple solutions for all these things.
###3780 I have people writing it to me, it's
###3782 like, my child is now taking your vitamin C
###3784 and grapeseed extract that you recommended,
###3786 and he suddenly changed.
###3787 And he says, Daddy, I like this so much more than the medicine.
###3790 This makes me feel so good.
###3791 Just simple anti-inflammatories for the brain
###3794 rather than taking a drug that does not cure anything,
###3797 nor do they claim to cure anything.
###3799 It only creates more of the same problem that caused ADHD
###3803 in the first place, very similar to any drug addiction.
###3806 Anyway, you've been a great audience here at Google.
###3808 Thanks for inviting me, and thanks for the great
###3812 work that you do.
###3813 Appreciate it.
###3815
