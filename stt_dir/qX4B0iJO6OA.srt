1
0:0:0,16 --> 0:0:4,41
lots of friends are gonna jump into the
game here everytime fire nobody else


2
0:0:4,41 --> 0:0:7,38
there but current i'd heads-up


3
0:0:7,38 --> 0:0:9,799
montana so was fine


4
0:0:9,799 --> 0:0:13,559
this is the former vice president of the
united states of america right


5
0:0:13,559 --> 0:0:16,39
and he sells his news network


6
0:0:16,39 --> 0:0:17,18
clearly


7
0:0:17,18 --> 0:0:21,619
anti-american newschannel called algis
you've had watched


8
0:0:21,619 --> 0:0:24,63
uh... how you can be made carries his
critics


9
0:0:24,63 --> 0:0:26,55
on khalili intersted


10
0:0:26,55 --> 0:0:29,44
yes like i said i don't know that you
got you


11
0:0:29,44 --> 0:0:34,369
aka the sister is the end of it is their
words did uses that


12
0:0:34,369 --> 0:0:40,75
clearly anti american of said the guy in
an incredible brigid fred


13
0:0:40,75 --> 0:0:42,119
qatar hands the


14
0:0:42,119 --> 0:0:43,379
the larges


15
0:0:43,379 --> 0:0:45,95
the u_s_ military base in the middle
east


16
0:0:45,95 --> 0:0:48,69
card yes on sponsors your


17
0:0:48,69 --> 0:0:50,1
uh... we have been


18
0:0:50,1 --> 0:0:53,309
in maisie relations with qatar the u_s_
government has now you can criticize


19
0:0:53,309 --> 0:0:56,949
that relationship and there's legitimate
grounds to do so but the claim that


20
0:0:56,949 --> 0:1:1,32
print card is somehow anti american when
they have the lord's military base


21
0:1:1,32 --> 0:1:2,46
and this


22
0:1:2,46 --> 0:1:5,499
decades long regulation for the u_s_ is


23
0:1:5,499 --> 0:1:7,729
plays ito clearly and uh...


24
0:1:7,729 --> 0:1:12,24
but now a little earlier clearly
particularly doubt it's if i had


25
0:1:12,24 --> 0:1:15,27
interest in the eighty american you know
when i do by said of the largest


26
0:1:15,27 --> 0:1:18,54
american military bases in the region to
love our last three


27
0:1:18,54 --> 0:1:20,69
orders have watched from there


28
0:1:20,69 --> 0:1:22,15
reading about it


29
0:1:22,15 --> 0:1:23,709
aren't we a lot more on that


30
0:1:23,709 --> 0:1:25,18
for thinking about that


31
0:1:25,18 --> 0:1:29,78
it's it's not that they were there only
don potential buyer you had other people


32
0:1:29,78 --> 0:1:34,549
trying to court correct t_v_ and one of
them was glenn beck and the blaze but


33
0:1:34,549 --> 0:1:39,55
apparently their philosophies in just a
little for out would be comfortable with


34
0:1:39,55 --> 0:1:41,9
frederick well also strickland a


35
0:1:41,9 --> 0:1:45,34
done that wants to buy this this evening
that wraps up houses


36
0:1:45,34 --> 0:1:49,79
filled with very sensitive to the
networks not allot not being online out


37
0:1:49,79 --> 0:1:51,159
point-of-view in other words


38
0:1:51,159 --> 0:1:55,799
catalogs glenn beck ok bigelow the sheik
them but i don't have it is the right


39
0:1:55,799 --> 0:2:0,119
that's the impact of your if you can see
more do without this year i think that


40
0:2:0,119 --> 0:2:1,91
that mister red white and blue


41
0:2:1,91 --> 0:2:4,47
like this to there's a lot of first of
that


42
0:2:4,47 --> 0:2:8,59
packet back explain himself on the radio
show i try to buy the network right he


43
0:2:8,59 --> 0:2:9,14
says


44
0:2:9,14 --> 0:2:13,72
and gore wouldn't that be yes he would
meet with you one because the you he


45
0:2:13,72 --> 0:2:15,39
doesn't agree with a word to say


46
0:2:15,39 --> 0:2:18,1
that makes sense he's actually being


47
0:2:18,1 --> 0:2:21,44
it because i i would argue thought that
was on the back


48
0:2:21,44 --> 0:2:22,67
that's right


49
0:2:22,67 --> 0:2:24,889
so now there were two it is


50
0:2:24,889 --> 0:2:29,6
you have no money piperlime beggars
broker an agreement to be a five hundred


51
0:2:29,6 --> 0:2:33,99
million dollars to buy that their
station well actually later in the same


52
0:2:33,99 --> 0:2:37,68
radio this segment of baghdad he admits
he didn't have the money he said i mean


53
0:2:37,68 --> 0:2:41,209
that we thought about whether we can
raise the money in other words you don't


54
0:2:41,209 --> 0:2:42,219
have it


55
0:2:42,219 --> 0:2:46,159
and we decided that it doesn't work for
a cinematic money 'cause it be touristy


56
0:2:46,159 --> 0:2:47,65
and would be doubled and other people


57
0:2:47,65 --> 0:2:48,559
in other words


58
0:2:48,559 --> 0:2:51,16
your knowledge in a buyer at all


59
0:2:51,16 --> 0:2:56,849
because if you see the trial the station
but what can i


60
0:2:56,849 --> 0:3:0,97
but if you want to mess with court buses
for was smart enough not the media story


61
0:3:0,97 --> 0:3:4,0
as what can you believe you wouldn't
sell them on that


62
0:3:4,0 --> 0:3:6,99
the iraqi believe described


63
0:3:6,99 --> 0:3:7,75
without prior


64
0:3:7,75 --> 0:3:12,6
scientific assessment one when glenn
except self-discovery talwar


65
0:3:12,6 --> 0:3:15,599
hotly-contested


66
0:3:15,599 --> 0:3:16,879
did make an offer


67
0:3:16,879 --> 0:3:21,369
do out like how you know christian by
the way


68
0:3:21,369 --> 0:3:24,59
that use of these they make fun of
ulster


69
0:3:24,59 --> 0:3:24,92
and a half


70
0:3:24,92 --> 0:3:27,439
and what i level band is there a time


71
0:3:27,439 --> 0:3:29,969
when he so tell me that like


72
0:3:29,969 --> 0:3:31,579
today so that the


73
0:3:31,579 --> 0:3:33,9
alters


74
0:3:33,9 --> 0:3:43,34
uh... you itself saleable


75
0:3:43,34 --> 0:3:45,249
there but it does


76
0:3:45,249 --> 0:3:46,93
them once did


77
0:3:46,93 --> 0:3:53,419
the army's dot about this divided and
actually told me this is that work bala


78
0:3:53,419 --> 0:3:54,5
he's got a


79
0:3:54,5 --> 0:3:56,759
and electrical all


80
0:3:56,759 --> 0:3:58,29
pat but thats


81
0:3:58,29 --> 0:4:5,46
sabra corporate catholics both the left
hand on his right so i i was window


82
0:4:5,46 --> 0:4:9,5
right while we're gonna lose awards do
they only want to do in two thousand


83
0:4:9,5 --> 0:4:10,199
seven


84
0:4:10,199 --> 0:4:14,89
rather than half of this is just out
there and watch program


85
0:4:14,89 --> 0:4:16,749
that computes the means some of the


86
0:4:16,749 --> 0:4:21,35
best words insurable losing our hours
after the journalism


87
0:4:21,35 --> 0:4:24,66
or do you have an orange reidy


88
0:4:24,66 --> 0:4:28,389
so uh... goes all the words of one of
course licenses and i said in a mention


89
0:4:28,389 --> 0:4:32,37
factor just maker of the word all the
seriousness of the kids are about singer


90
0:4:32,37 --> 0:4:34,43
that never returns for the was the guy
that


91
0:4:34,43 --> 0:4:36,8
does that work for the backup


92
0:4:36,8 --> 0:4:40,789
many i don't know how dramatically
different is that the bbc


93
0:4:40,789 --> 0:4:44,81
and so i don't know what independence
without the stories about the


94
0:4:44,81 --> 0:4:48,639
uh... platter attempting to influence of
the roundout successfully but i'm sure


95
0:4:48,639 --> 0:4:52,2
that that issue they have to deal with
is a worthy thing that turns people are


96
0:4:52,2 --> 0:4:56,99
talk about obviously that's not
something that cable talking about


97
0:4:56,99 --> 0:4:58,52
what one last thing


98
0:4:58,52 --> 0:5:4,41
out since their upon fight state
cambodia's instead invite activities in


99
0:5:4,41 --> 0:5:7,499

accepted their is one of the cable news
word that has a second larger


101
0:5:10,879 --> 0:5:12,93
shareholder who might be a


102
0:5:12,93 --> 0:5:14,8

listen


106
0:5:22,239 --> 0:5:24,139

because i think that the properly and
for relevant so all arguments


116
0:5:56,34 --> 0:6:2,73
by just using the word of desert buffet
although it's a good point out that


117
0:6:2,73 --> 0:6:4,949
alternatives era of


118
0:6:4,949 --> 0:8:4,949
