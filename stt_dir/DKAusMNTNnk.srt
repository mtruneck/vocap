It is one of Kyrgystan's

10

One of the other traditions, a

your bride.


12

21
0:1:4,55 --> 0:1:6,51

22
0:1:6,51 --> 0:1:8,68
The Kyrgyz people celebrated
the end of communism by


23
0:1:8,68 --> 0:1:11,32
adopting Islam as the state
religion and getting really


24
0:1:11,32 --> 0:1:13,78

THOMAS MORTON: Bride kidnapping
is a traditional


28
0:1:21,88 --> 0:1:23,99
way of getting married that
supposedly dates back to the


29
0:1:23,99 --> 0:1:25,38

30
0:1:25,38 --> 0:1:27,89
How it works is a guy wants to
marry a girl, he gets a few of


31
0:1:27,89 --> 0:1:31,245
his friends together, they grab
the girl off the street,


32
0:1:31,245 --> 0:1:33,78
then they drive her back to
his place, and his mom and


33
0:1:33,78 --> 0:1:35,87
aunts try to convince her that
marrying their son is the


34
0:1:35,87 --> 0:1:37,12

I wanted to marry him, but I did
not want to be kidnapped

0:17:55,734 --> 0:17:59,66
The old tradition of Kyrgyzstan
is the Manas Epis.

0:18:14,4 --> 0:18:15,84
It's a violation of Islam.

It's a violation of the law.

And it's pretty clear that prior

an acceptable traditional

307
0:20:39,993 --> 0:20:42,33
from the groom's family go over
to the bride's house and


308
0:20:42,33 --> 0:20:45,11
tell her parents, sorry, we
kidnapped your daughter.


309
0:20:45,11 --> 0:20:46,47
Is that OK?


310
0:20:46,47 --> 0:20:49,57
Unsurprisingly, this process
can also take a while.

hallowed the practice of
bride kidnapping was.


352
0:23:24,2 --> 0:23:27,64
But if it's not even in Manas,
the country's national epic,

how old actually is it?


354
0:23:30,27 --> 0:23:32,48
RUSSELL KLEINBACH: If we go back
to the 19th century, when


355
0:23:32,48 --> 0:23:35,12
you had tribal groups, they
would go through villages, and


356
0:23:35,12 --> 0:23:37,2
they would steal horses,
and cattle, and women.


357
0:23:37,2 --> 0:23:38,94
So there is a tradition
of stealing.


358
0:23:38,94 --> 0:23:42,13
But it would produce a real
conflict between tribes and


359
0:23:42,13 --> 0:23:44,74
was not an acceptable
traditional practice.


360
0:23:44,74 --> 0:23:46,96
And all the evidence shows
that kidnapping was on an


361
0:23:46,96 --> 0:23:49,81
increase from the latter period
of the Soviet period.


362
0:23:49,81 --> 0:23:52,26
And then it continued to
increase at the end of the


363
0:23:52,26 --> 0:23:53,59
Soviet period.


364
0:23:53,59 --> 0:23:55,96
The Soviets said, first of
all, we're going to stop


365
0:23:55,96 --> 0:23:59,75
marriages of young girls before
the age of 15 or so.


366
0:23:59,75 --> 0:24:2,2
We're going to now send both
boys and girls to high school


367
0:24:2,2 --> 0:24:3,17
and college.


368
0:24:3,17 --> 0:24:5,88
We collectivized the wealth so
there's no money for bride


369
0:24:5,88 --> 0:24:7,21
price and a dowry.


370
0:24:7,21 --> 0:24:9,13
So now the young people
are getting older


371
0:24:9,13 --> 0:24:10,4
before they get married.


372
0:24:10,4 --> 0:24:11,29
They go off to the university.


373
0:24:11,29 --> 0:24:13,65
And they may come back
and say, I found


374
0:24:13,65 --> 0:24:15,6
someone I'd like to marry.


375
0:24:15,6 --> 0:24:17,58
And the parents say no, we're
arranging a marriage for you


376
0:24:17,58 --> 0:24:18,42
in the village.


377
0:24:18,42 --> 0:24:21,76
So she might go back to the
university, or he, talk to the


378
0:24:21,76 --> 0:24:24,29
boyfriend or girlfriend and
says, is there any legitimate


379
0:24:24,29 --> 0:24:27,12
way we can get married against
our parents wishes.


380
0:24:27,12 --> 0:24:29,955
You say, well, I will kidnap
you, take you to my home, keep


381
0:24:29,955 --> 0:24:30,79
you overnight.


382
0:24:30,79 --> 0:24:33,37
Then they will consider you an
unclean girl, and so they will


383
0:24:33,37 --> 0:24:34,74
have to let you marry me.


384
0:24:34,74 --> 0:24:38,82

kidnapping is a response to

I think I found my suit.

We were really getting into the
spirit of the festivities,

from their wedding

If she's a virgin, she's going
to bleed on the sheet.

And then they take it out.

the day after a Kyrgyz

yourself to her new

Still kind of not sure how to
feel about this whole thing.
