TOMMY ANDRES, CNN ANCHOR: Hi, everyone, I`m
Tommy Andres. I`m a correspondent with CNN


2
0:0:16,67 --> 0:0:21,0
Radio, but today, I am filling in for Carl
and hanging out with you for this Friday edition


3
0:0:21,0 --> 0:0:22,97
of CNN STUDENT NEWS.


4
0:0:22,97 --> 0:0:27,81
First up, news from the United Nations Security
Council. The group voted yesterday for stronger


5
0:0:27,81 --> 0:0:33,32
punishments against North Korea. It is a reaction
to that country`s latest rocket launches and


6
0:0:33,32 --> 0:0:38,41
nuclear tests. There has been a lot of tension
between North Korea and other countries over


7
0:0:38,41 --> 0:0:44,809
its nuclear program, so that Security Council
vote may not seem surprising. What is interesting


8
0:0:44,809 --> 0:0:50,47
is that it was unanimous. China, one of North
Korea`s strongest allies, voted in favor of


9
0:0:50,47 --> 0:0:55,54
the punishments. These punishments are designed
to change a country`s potentially threatening


10
0:0:55,54 --> 0:1:0,79
behavior. Sometimes they work. Other times,
they don`t really have much impact.


11
0:1:0,79 --> 0:1:5,14
You may have heard about filibusters in social
studies class. We`ve talked about them before


12
0:1:5,14 --> 0:1:11,25
on our show. They are a way for a U.S. senator
to block or delay a vote. On Wednesday, we


13
0:1:11,25 --> 0:1:13,99
actually saw one. Here is what happened.


14
0:1:13,99 --> 0:1:19,72
John Brennan is President Obama`s nominee
to run the CIA. But the Senate makes the final


15
0:1:19,72 --> 0:1:24,59
call, and Brennan is a controversial pick
because of his connection to the use of drones.


16
0:1:24,59 --> 0:1:29,67
He`s been an adviser to the president on homeland
security and counter-terrorism issues. He


17
0:1:29,67 --> 0:1:34,9
is a big supporter of using unmanned aircraft.
The president has been criticized for his


18
0:1:34,9 --> 0:1:38,58
position on drones, including the possibility
that they could be used to target Americans


19
0:1:38,58 --> 0:1:43,689
who pose a threat to the United States. Senator
Rand Paul wants more answers about the president`s


20
0:1:43,689 --> 0:1:48,84
drone policies. On Wednesday, he used a filibuster
to try and push for those answers.


21
0:1:48,84 --> 0:1:52,81
The way it works is that when you get control
of the Senate floor, you don`t give it up.


22
0:1:52,81 --> 0:1:53,49
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


23
0:1:53,49 --> 0:1:59,3
SEN. RAND PAUL, R-KY.: I rise today to begin
to filibuster John Brennan`s nomination for


24
0:1:59,3 --> 0:2:7,14
the CIA. I will speak until I can no longer
speak. I will speak for as long as it takes.


25
0:2:7,14 --> 0:2:16,25
Has America the beautiful become Alice`s Wonderland?
"No, no, said the queen, sentence first, verdict


26
0:2:16,25 --> 0:2:25,549
afterwards. Stuff of nonsense, Alice said
loudly. The idea of having the sentence first?


27
0:2:25,549 --> 0:2:33,319
Hold your tongue, said the queen, turning
purple. I won`t, said Alice. Release the drones,


28
0:2:33,319 --> 0:2:40,209
said the queen, as she shouted at the top
of her voice." Lewis Carroll is fiction, right?


29
0:2:40,209 --> 0:2:46,829
I have allowed the president to pick his political
appointees, but I will not sit quietly and


30
0:2:46,829 --> 0:2:53,669
let him shred the Constitution. I cannot sit
at my desk quietly and let the president says


31
0:2:53,669 --> 0:2:59,779
that he will kill Americans on American soil
who are not actively attacking the country.


32
0:2:59,779 --> 0:3:8,849
Which has previously brought a challenge in
federal court, to the legality of the authorization


33
0:3:8,849 --> 0:3:9,469
to target.


34
0:3:9,469 --> 0:3:16,139
I would go for another 12 hours to try to
break Strom Thurmond`s record, but I`ve discovered


35
0:3:16,139 --> 0:3:20,59
that there are some limits to filibustering,
and I`m going to have to go take care of one


36
0:3:20,59 --> 0:3:21,93
of those in a few minutes here.


37
0:3:21,93 --> 0:3:22,599
(LAUGHTER)


38
0:3:22,599 --> 0:3:27,959
PAUL: I thank you very much for the forbearance,
and I yield the floor.


39
0:3:27,959 --> 0:3:28,43
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. President.


40
0:3:28,43 --> 0:3:29,269
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Senator from Illinois.


41
0:3:29,269 --> 0:3:30,349
(END VIDEO CLIP)


42
0:3:30,349 --> 0:3:34,459
ANDRES: Senator Paul has gotten some support
and some criticism for his filibuster. He


43
0:3:34,459 --> 0:3:39,389
also says he`s gotten a response from the
White House. Yesterday, John Brennan was confirmed


44
0:3:39,389 --> 0:3:41,919
as the next CIA director.


45
0:3:41,919 --> 0:3:46,799
Next up, authorities at this cat haven sanctuary
are going to investigate a tragic accident


46
0:3:46,799 --> 0:3:51,599
that happened at a California facility. On
Wednesday, an intern who worked with the animals


47
0:3:51,599 --> 0:3:57,409
there was mauled and killed by one of the
sanctuary`s African lions. It`s just one example


48
0:3:57,409 --> 0:4:3,89
we`ve seen recently of the potential risks
when humans and creatures enter each other`s


49
0:4:3,89 --> 0:4:7,979
habitats. When two park workers in Florida
accidentally disturbed a hive, they were swarmed


50
0:4:7,979 --> 0:4:13,79
by tens of thousands of Africanized honey
bees. That species is very aggressive, especially


51
0:4:13,79 --> 0:4:18,699
if bothered. The men were stung nearly 100
times each.


52
0:4:18,699 --> 0:4:22,86
Thousands of sharks swimming offshore force
some South Florida beaches to close. Experts


53
0:4:22,86 --> 0:4:28,229
say the sharks aren`t after people, but going
in the water means you`re entering their habitat,


54
0:4:28,229 --> 0:4:32,419
and in a case of mistaken identity, if a shark
thinks the person is a smaller fish, could


55
0:4:32,419 --> 0:4:37,62
lead to problems. And these iReport images
from Israel show things going in the opposite


56
0:4:37,62 --> 0:4:42,25
direction. All those black specs, they are
locusts and they are migrating north in search


57
0:4:42,25 --> 0:4:46,379
of food. And when they come across farmland,
areas where farmers are growing fruits and


58
0:4:46,379 --> 0:4:51,3
vegetables, the insects can attack the crops
and leave them decimated.


59
0:4:51,3 --> 0:4:57,689
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Is this legit? The idea
for an International Women`s Day was suggested


60
0:4:57,689 --> 0:5:5,569
at a conference in 1910. It`s true. One year
later, more than a million people went to


61
0:5:5,569 --> 0:5:10,46
International Women`s Day rallies.


62
0:5:10,46 --> 0:5:17,409
ANDRES: For 100 years, International Women`s
Day has been celebrated on March 8th, today.


63
0:5:17,409 --> 0:5:21,74
The international celebration eventually led
to the creation of Women`s History Month in


64
0:5:21,74 --> 0:5:26,75
the U.S. This year`s month-long theme is about
honoring women in STEM fields. We`re talking


65
0:5:26,75 --> 0:5:31,15
about science, technology, engineering and
math. And women like these.


66
0:5:31,15 --> 0:5:32,139
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


67
0:5:32,139 --> 0:5:36,53
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: When Jane Goodall was
22, she was invited to visit her friend`s


68
0:5:36,53 --> 0:5:41,81
farm in Africa. When she arrived, she was
asked to study a group of chimpanzees. That`s


69
0:5:41,81 --> 0:5:46,699
how she began a career of studying and writing
about chimps that`s helped the scientific


70
0:5:46,699 --> 0:5:51,34
community learn tremendous amounts about the
behavior of these animals and about their


71
0:5:51,34 --> 0:5:53,6
natural habitat.


72
0:5:53,6 --> 0:5:58,62
As a child, May Jamieson loved to read about
science, especially astronomy. She went on


73
0:5:58,62 --> 0:6:4,5
to earn a degree in chemical engineering and
become a medical doctor. But eventually, Jamieson


74
0:6:4,5 --> 0:6:10,219
returned to her love of astronomy and applied
for the science program. On September 12,


75
0:6:10,219 --> 0:6:16,419
1992, she flew aboard the Shuttle Endeavour
as the first African-American woman in space.


76
0:6:16,419 --> 0:6:20,93
A book called "The Sands of Mars" inspired
Donna Lee Shirley`s curiosity about the Red


77
0:6:20,93 --> 0:6:26,819
Planet. Shirley earned bachelor`s and masters
degrees in aerospace engineering and came


78
0:6:26,819 --> 0:6:33,669
to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 1966 to
work on the first unmanned mission to Mars.


79
0:6:33,669 --> 0:6:38,96
Thirty years later, she was managing the Mars
exploration program when the Pathfinder and


80
0:6:38,96 --> 0:6:43,68
Sojourner rovers successfully explored the
Red Planet`s surface.


81
0:6:43,68 --> 0:6:49,629
In the late `80s and early `90s, Danica McKellar
starred on the TV show, "The Wonder Years."


82
0:6:49,629 --> 0:6:54,939
What many fans may not know is that McKellar
later graduated from UCLA with a degree in


83
0:6:54,939 --> 0:7:0,46
mathematics. She even helped write a math
theorem that`s named for her. McKellar has


84
0:7:0,46 --> 0:7:5,87
also written books about girls and math, saying
that she`s combining her love of entertainment


85
0:7:5,87 --> 0:7:9,5
and math to make the subject more entertaining.


86
0:7:9,5 --> 0:7:10,529
(END VIDEOTAPE)


87
0:7:10,529 --> 0:7:16,249
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Today`s Shoutout goes
out to Mrs. Slossom`s (ph) U.S. history classes


88
0:7:16,249 --> 0:7:22,29
at Gennessee Valley (ph) Central school in
Belmont, New York. Which U.S. president moved


89
0:7:22,29 --> 0:7:28,729
the start of daylight savings time from April
to March? Was it Lyndon Johnson, Ronald Reagan,


90
0:7:28,729 --> 0:7:32,789
Bill Clinton or George W. Bush? You`ve got
3 seconds, go.


91
0:7:32,789 --> 0:7:44,93
The 
earlier start began in 2007 under President
George W. Bush. The reason was kind of the


92
0:7:44,93 --> 0:7:51,229
same idea why daylight savings time originally
started. That`s your answer and that`s your


93
0:7:51,229 --> 0:7:51,68
shoutout.


94
0:7:51,68 --> 0:7:52,58
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


95
0:7:52,58 --> 0:7:58,24
CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: It puzzles the daylights
out of some people. Why have daylight savings


96
0:7:58,24 --> 0:8:2,669
time if daylight is just going to get longer
anyway as the Northern Hemisphere approaches


97
0:8:2,669 --> 0:8:8,2
summer? Well, for one thing, it`s the law.
Before 1966, states had different times and


98
0:8:8,2 --> 0:8:12,729
dates for springing forward and falling back.
The Uniform Time Act was passed to get them


99
0:8:12,729 --> 0:8:17,259
all synched up. But unlike many other laws,
if states don`t want to participate, they


100
0:8:17,259 --> 0:8:22,319
don`t have to. Most of the state of Arizona,
as well as Hawaii, don`t. So if you go there,


101
0:8:22,319 --> 0:8:26,249
they`ll tell you what time it is. The idea
is a lot older than the `60s, though. Ben


102
0:8:26,249 --> 0:8:30,84
Franklin apparently had enough time on his
hands to propose saving daylight, and several


103
0:8:30,84 --> 0:8:36,27
countries took him up on it. Well, they did
about 130 years later. World War I was on,


104
0:8:36,27 --> 0:8:41,219
so daylight saving time was used to help save
electricity. With the sun up later, people


105
0:8:41,219 --> 0:8:45,81
didn`t need to turn lights on until later.
It stopped nationally after the war, and stayed


106
0:8:45,81 --> 0:8:50,949
that way until Congress got around to setting
times for it. But today, daylight saving time


107
0:8:50,949 --> 0:8:56,44
is sleepy time for many Americans, especially
Monday morning after springing ahead. The


108
0:8:56,44 --> 0:9:1,23
Better Sleep Council says people struggle
and slog around in bad moods. SleepBetter.org


109
0:9:1,23 --> 0:9:6,5
says America loses hundreds of millions of
dollars because workers aren`t as productive


110
0:9:6,5 --> 0:9:10,51
until they get used to it. They`re not saying
we should get rid of daylight saving time,


111
0:9:10,51 --> 0:9:14,57
but this sheds light on why some sleepy people
might want to.


112
0:9:14,57 --> 0:9:15,93
Carl Azuz, CNN, Atlanta.


113
0:9:15,93 --> 0:9:16,769
(END VIDEOTAPE)


114
0:9:16,769 --> 0:9:20,779
ANDRES: Before we go, we`re going to get in
a little snowboarding story. Bet you didn`t


115
0:9:20,779 --> 0:9:25,17
think I meant this. That`s Eden Grace (ph)
on the board. When this video was shot, she


116
0:9:25,17 --> 0:9:29,959
wasn`t even 2 years old. And this wasn`t even
close to her first time on a snowboard. Her


117
0:9:29,959 --> 0:9:34,17
parents say she`s been going up the mountain
since she was six weeks old. She learned to


118
0:9:34,17 --> 0:9:39,25
shred before she could walk. If she`s already
this talented at 2, by the time she gets older,


119
0:9:39,25 --> 0:9:42,149
there`s snow telling how good she`ll be.


120
0:9:42,149 --> 0:9:45,63
Time for us to pack it in. Remember to set
your clocks ahead this weekend, and teachers,


121
0:9:45,63 --> 0:9:50,38
remember to share your feedback about today`s
show on our home page. I`m Tommy Andres. Have


122
0:9:50,38 --> 0:11:50,38
a great weekend.
