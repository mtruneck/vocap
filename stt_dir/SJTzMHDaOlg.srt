0:2:3,35 --> 0:2:6,57
HANNAH BROOKS: A waria is an
Indonesian transsexual,


5
0:2:6,57 --> 0:2:10,24
derived from the words wanita,
meaning woman, and pria, man.


6
0:2:10,24 --> 0:2:14,34
Waria are known as Indonesia's
third sex.


7
0:2:14,34 --> 0:2:17,32
This centuries-old tradition is
largely accepted as part of


8
0:2:17,32 --> 0:2:18,95
Indonesian culture.


9
0:2:18,95 --> 0:2:22,2
However, it's one that doesn't
sit easily with Islam, which


10
0:2:22,2 --> 0:2:24,74
has risen to become the
country's dominant religion


11
0:2:24,74 --> 0:2:27,9
since it's arrival in
the 13th century.


12
0:2:27,9 --> 0:2:31,14
Since Islamic law acknowledges
only two sexes, male and


13
0:2:31,14 --> 0:2:34,52
female, and forbids men to dress
and adopt the mannerisms


14
0:2:34,52 --> 0:2:37,31
of women, waria have been pushed
further and further


15
0:2:37,31 --> 0:2:40,61
into the margins of society.


16
0:2:40,61 --> 0:2:43,9
This makes it difficult to
practice their faith.


17
0:2:43,9 --> 0:2:45,74
While it seems strange that the
waria are passionate about


18
0:2:45,74 --> 0:2:48,96
a religion that shuns them, they
believe that even if the


19
0:2:48,96 --> 0:2:50,9
majority of Islamic
authorities don't


20
0:2:50,9 --> 0:2:53,36
accept them, God does.


21
0:2:53,36 --> 0:2:56,91
I headed out to meet Maryani, a
50-year-old transsexual who


22
0:2:56,91 --> 0:2:59,65
runs the Senin-Kamis School
from the back


23
0:2:59,65 --> 0:3:0,5
of her beauty salon.


24
0:3:0,5 --> 0:3:3,66
And is mother to her adopted
daughter Rizky, who she raises


25
0:3:3,66 --> 0:3:5,6
on her own.


26
0:3:5,6 --> 0:3:7,39
Maryani greeted my translator,
Mendez, and


27
0:3:7,39 --> 0:3:8,7
myself at the door.


28
0:3:8,7 --> 0:3:11,21
And asked us to come in quietly,
as we had arrived in


29
0:3:11,21 --> 0:3:12,82

HANNAH BROOKS: As I talked with
her more, Maryani told me


35
0:3:55,83 --> 0:3:57,4
about her life.


36
0:3:57,4 --> 0:3:59,49
Despite living through some
tough times, she also had a


37
0:3:59,49 --> 0:4:1,24
lot of fun when she
was younger.


38
0:4:1,24 --> 0:4:3,78
She used to be the singer in
a dangdut band, which is


39
0:4:3,78 --> 0:4:6,2
Indonesia's sexy style
of pop music.


40
0:4:6,2 --> 0:4:8,31
And from her description,
it sounded like her


41
0:4:8,31 --> 0:4:10,1
career was a big deal.


42
0:4:10,1 --> 0:4:13,25
That all changed when she
converted to Islam in her 30s.


43
0:4:13,25 --> 0:4:16,4
She left behind her hedonistic
lifestyle to focus on her


44
0:4:16,4 --> 0:4:17,22
spirituality.


45
0:4:17,22 --> 0:4:19,36
Because, as she puts
it, her conversion


46
0:4:19,36 --> 0:4:20,745
came from the heart.

HANNAH BROOKS: Following the
2006 earthquake that rocked


53
0:5:1,75 --> 0:5:4,5
Yogyakarta, Maryani gathered
lots of her friends to


54
0:5:4,5 --> 0:5:7,2
participate in some of
the mass prayers.


55
0:5:7,2 --> 0:5:9,63
An older priest friend was so
impressed by her efforts and


56
0:5:9,63 --> 0:5:12,98
ability to draw a large group
that he invited her to start a


57
0:5:12,98 --> 0:5:14,71
place for the transvestites
to gather.


58
0:5:14,71 --> 0:5:16,98

hanging out with Maryani and

0:5:32,16 --> 0:5:35,11
wanted to spend some more time
talking to her one on one.


63
0:5:35,11 --> 0:5:37,85
But unexpectedly, she asked me
if I'd like to attend the

died from HIV

68
0:5:46,3 --> 0:5:48,44
I agreed, and we hopped
in the car.


69
0:5:48,44 --> 0:5:50,67
Maryani's friend Yuni Shara,
who was a member of the


70

us to the funeral.


71

90
0:7:15,44 --> 0:7:18,9

speech about the importance of


105
0:8:19,53 --> 0:8:23,27
warias acting with dignity and
self-respect in order to be


106
0:8:23,27 --> 0:8:25,83
seen as equal members
of society.


107
0:8:25,83 --> 0:8:27,93
She encouraged them to
contribute to the funeral

pass away.


109
0:8:30,5 --> 0:8:33,49
However, most of the warias
didn't seem to be paying much


110
0:8:33,49 --> 0:8:35,25
attention to what
she was saying.


111
0:8:35,25 --> 0:8:37,409
They gave off the impression
that a funeral is just

And in fact, it wasn't
that far off.


114

Usually four warias die each
month, mostly from the things

against in her speech.

HANNAH BROOKS: The girls stood
for a while by the train


208
0:16:21,1 --> 0:16:23,47
tracks but didn't get
any customers.


209
0:16:23,47 --> 0:16:26,2
They decided to head over to
a busier street they also


210
0:16:26,2 --> 0:16:27,65
regularly work.


211
0:16:27,65 --> 0:16:30,83
We hung out across the road,
away from potential customers,


212
0:16:30,83 --> 0:16:32,9
so that the girls could
do their thing.


213
0:16:32,9 --> 0:16:35,52
A few guys approached here and
there, but for the most part,


214
0:16:35,52 --> 0:16:37,0
nothing really happened.


215
0:16:37,0 --> 0:16:39,58
The girls drank booze with a
shopkeeper, practiced their


216
0:16:39,58 --> 0:16:41,89
poses, and played with
their phones.


217
0:16:41,89 --> 0:16:43,99
After a few hours, it didn't
look like they were going to


218
0:16:43,99 --> 0:16:47,356
have much luck tonight.


219
0:16:47,356 --> 0:16:49,5
It's about midnight now.


220
0:16:49,5 --> 0:16:51,5
We've just been standing across
the other side of the


221
0:16:51,5 --> 0:16:54,67
road to let the girls kind of do
their thing and try and get


222
0:16:54,67 --> 0:16:55,77
some customers.


223
0:16:55,77 --> 0:16:56,31
I don't know.


224
0:16:56,31 --> 0:16:58,31
I just don't know
how they do it.


225
0:16:58,31 --> 0:17:1,75
Like Nur was saying, she just
wants to go out tonight and


226
0:17:1,75 --> 0:17:5,63
work so that she can have some
money to get through tomorrow.


227
0:17:5,63 --> 0:17:7,79
They definitely have dreams and
things they want to do in


228
0:17:7,79 --> 0:17:9,79
the future and stuff.


229
0:17:9,79 --> 0:17:11,91
But they can only
think this far.


230
0:17:11,91 --> 0:17:13,8
They can't really plan.


231
0:17:13,8 --> 0:17:16,589
It's very much in the
day for them.


232
0:17:16,589 --> 0:17:17,819
Anyway, it's time to go home.


233
0:17:17,819 --> 0:17:19,414
I'm going to go across the road
now and say goodbye to


234
0:17:19,414 --> 0:17:21,619
the girls, and wish them
good luck for tonight.


235
0:17:21,619 --> 0:17:23,846
I hope they make some cash.


236
0:17:23,846 --> 0:17:25,619
And I hope they stay safe.


237
0:17:25,619 --> 0:17:28,83
As we were wrapping up, we
noticed one particular guy


238
0:17:28,83 --> 0:17:31,8
pestering Nur and creeping
her out quite a bit.


239
0:17:31,8 --> 0:17:34,52
He looked like the kind of guy
who couldn't afford the girls'


240
0:17:34,52 --> 0:17:35,65
low prices.


241
0:17:35,65 --> 0:17:38,845
As he kept hassling Nur, Novi
ran over to us and asked if


242
0:17:38,845 --> 0:17:41,212
we'd take Nur home.


243
0:17:41,212 --> 0:17:45,604

0:17:45,604 --> 0:17:49,16
HANNAH BROOKS: Nur
wants to go home?


245
0:17:49,16 --> 0:17:50,57
Yeah, sure.


246

HANNAH BROOKS: The next morning
we woke up and headed


250
0:18:19,67 --> 0:18:23,1
to a small village somewhere
outside Yogyakarta.


251
0:18:23,1 --> 0:18:25,76
Jamila was getting a black
market breast job and agreed


252
0:18:25,76 --> 0:18:28,94
to let us come, as long as we
didn't film where we were or


253
0:18:28,94 --> 0:18:31,21
who was doing the procedure.


254
0:18:31,21 --> 0:18:33,79
I knew that it was common for
warias who believe it makes


255
0:18:33,79 --> 0:18:36,42
them look more feminine to
inject silicone into their


256
0:18:36,42 --> 0:18:37,71
faces and breasts.


257
0:18:37,71 --> 0:18:39,33
Jamila was really excited.


258
0:18:39,33 --> 0:18:41,76
Because although she's had
injections in her cheeks and


259
0:18:41,76 --> 0:18:44,49
chin, she would be getting
boobs for the first time.

HANNAH BROOKS: The room
was incredibly hot,


264
0:19:24,7 --> 0:19:26,5
and definitely unsterile.


265
0:19:26,5 --> 0:19:29,35
And the sight of Jamila's chest
growing into two oddly


266
0:19:29,35 --> 0:19:32,13
shaped mounds was enough to make
both Mendez and I start


267
0:19:32,13 --> 0:19:34,721

little air after witnessing


274
0:20:4,4 --> 0:20:5,19
the operation.


275
0:20:5,19 --> 0:20:8,11
So we decided to head back to
Maryani's and check in with


276
0:20:8,11 --> 0:20:9,67
the rest of the warias.


277
0:20:9,67 --> 0:20:12,44
When we arrived, Maryani was
getting ready to head out on a


278
0:20:12,44 --> 0:20:15,12
scooter with Rizky and
told me to hop on.


279
0:20:15,12 --> 0:20:33,39



280
0:20:33,39 --> 0:20:35,81
We were heading to the market to
buy makeup and accessories


281
0:20:35,81 --> 0:20:37,793
for the big party
we were throwing


282
0:20:37,793 --> 0:20:39,4
the warias that night.


283
0:20:39,4 --> 0:20:41,86
Maryani seemed genuinely excited
to get the chance to


284
0:20:41,86 --> 0:20:43,308
go out with me for a bit.


285
0:20:43,308 --> 0:20:49,1



286
0:20:49,1 --> 0:20:51,767
She said that tonight was all
about celebrating being a

comfortable with yourself.

HANNAH BROOKS: The warias were
busy getting dolled up for the


291
0:21:47,41 --> 0:21:50,97
party while Maryani instructed
her assistant to make me look


292
0:21:50,97 --> 0:21:52,8
like the sexiest
waria possible.


293
0:21:52,8 --> 0:21:56,7



294
0:21:56,7 --> 0:21:59,97
So it appears that she
is now attaching


295
0:21:59,97 --> 0:22:2,34
the other large growth--

0:22:2,34 --> 0:22:4,89
some kind of tail, head tail.

0:24:57,207 --> 0:24:59,89



323
0:24:59,89 --> 0:25:2,885
The party was at a restaurant
with a stage, sound system,


324
0:25:2,885 --> 0:25:5,96
and a resident keyboard player,
who wanted to know who


325

the new lady-boy was
when I walked in.


326

Obviously, Maryani had done
a good job on my makeup.


327
0:25:12,86 --> 0:25:15,69
The waria were trying to be
on their best behavior.


328
0:25:15,69 --> 0:25:17,7
But some of the younger girls
were sneaking swigs of booze

0:25:17,7 --> 0:25:18,88
under the table.


330
0:25:18,88 --> 0:25:22,79
It might have helped them with
their performance anxiety.


331
0:25:22,79 --> 0:25:25,63
The warias took turns singing
and dancing, which involved a


332
0:25:25,63 --> 0:25:28,66
lot of dangdut and a
lot of Celine Dion.


333

I was super impressed by

The warias sang and danced
well into the night.


335

I was dragged to the dance floor
over and over, and did

my best to shake it like
a Javanese bride.


337
0:25:40,47 --> 0:25:42,99

HANNAH BROOKS: Even though their

better themselves, and
particularly by Maryani's

0:26:40,62 --> 0:26:42,94
refusal to play by the rules.


345
0:26:42,94 --> 0:26:45,92
It takes a courageous waria
to do what she has--


346
0:26:45,92 --> 0:26:48,97
raise a child on her own, reach
the pinnacle of wariadom


347
0:26:48,97 --> 0:26:52,18
by opening her own beauty salon,
and to start the school


348
0:26:52,18 --> 0:26:54,63
so that others might
do the same.


349
0:26:54,63 --> 0:26:57,32
As for the fact that the waria
are dedicated to the very


350
0:26:57,32 --> 0:27:0,49
religion that refuses to accept
them, I agree with what


351
0:27:0,49 --> 0:27:2,12
Maryani told me.


352
0:27:2,12 --> 0:27:4,33
Since God is the one that judges
whether they go to


353
0:27:4,33 --> 0:27:7,14
heaven or hell, it's their
relationship with Him that


354
0:27:7,14 --> 0:27:10,29
matters, not the opinions
of people.

With lipstick in their pockets
and God on their side, it


356
0:27:13,46 --> 0:27:15,32
seems the warias have
a fighting chance.
