1
0:0:0,433 --> 0:0:3,66
President Obama:
It is great to be back
in the Motor City.


2
0:0:3,66 --> 0:0:9,6
(applause)


3
0:0:9,6 --> 0:0:11,767
I notice the mood is a
little brighter on this


4
0:0:11,767 --> 0:0:12,6
particular visit.


5
0:0:12,6 --> 0:0:13,934
(laughter)


6
0:0:13,934 --> 0:0:17,934
I'd like to think it's because
everybody is excited about the


7
0:0:17,934 --> 0:0:21,967
Korea Free Trade Agreement, but
I suspect it might just have a


8
0:0:21,967 --> 0:0:25,3
little bit to do with your
Lions beating up on my Bears.


9
0:0:25,3 --> 0:0:33,1
(applause)


10
0:0:33,1 --> 0:0:34,467
All right, all right, all right.


11
0:0:34,467 --> 0:0:35,6
(laughter)


12
0:0:35,6 --> 0:0:36,667
Don't get carried away now.


13
0:0:36,667 --> 0:0:38,934
(laughter)


14
0:0:38,934 --> 0:0:41,567
Not to mention your Tigers
hanging in there last night.


15
0:0:41,567 --> 0:0:47,0
(applause)


16
0:0:47,0 --> 0:0:51,433
As you can see, President Lee
is a pretty good politician.


17
0:0:51,433 --> 0:0:54,333
(laughter and applause)


18
0:0:54,333 --> 0:0:56,8
He knows how to get
on your good side.


19
0:0:56,8 --> 0:1:2,433
(applause)


20
0:1:2,433 --> 0:1:7,133
Today I brought a good friend
and one of our closest allies,


21
0:1:7,133 --> 0:1:10,767
President Lee of South Korea.


22
0:1:10,767 --> 0:1:13,4
Some of you may know, President
Lee has got a remarkable story.


23
0:1:13,4 --> 0:1:18,967
He grew up a little
ways from Detroit,


24
0:1:18,967 --> 0:1:25,133
but he embodies that same spirit
that Detroit is all about.


25
0:1:25,133 --> 0:1:28,9
Through sheer grit
and determination,


26
0:1:28,9 --> 0:1:32,333
he worked his way from
the humblest beginnings.


27
0:1:32,333 --> 0:1:37,166
The South Korea of his
childhood was an extraordinarily


28
0:1:37,166 --> 0:1:38,734
poor country.


29
0:1:38,734 --> 0:1:41,333
But he worked his way
up, worked his way up,


30
0:1:41,333 --> 0:1:45,4
went to school while
cleaning streets,


31
0:1:45,4 --> 0:1:53,0
and eventually went on to run
a Hyundai machinery plant --


32
0:1:53,0 --> 0:1:55,734
so he knows a little
bit about cars --


33
0:1:55,734 --> 0:2:0,266
then the whole company, and
ultimately was elected the


34
0:2:0,266 --> 0:2:2,934
President of the
Republic of Korea.


35
0:2:2,934 --> 0:2:6,934
And this is a country that's
staged one of the world's


36
0:2:6,934 --> 0:2:12,7
greatest economic comebacks
that we've ever seen.


37
0:2:12,7 --> 0:2:17,667
So President Lee knows what it's
like to go through tough times.


38
0:2:17,667 --> 0:2:21,166
He knows what it's like when
folks have counted you out.


39
0:2:21,166 --> 0:2:24,7
And he knows what it's like
to make a big comeback.


40
0:2:24,7 --> 0:2:28,7
So with that, I want to welcome
President Lee to Detroit and


41
0:2:28,7 --> 0:2:29,9
have him say just a few words.


42
0:2:29,9 --> 0:2:51,533
(applause)


43
0:2:51,533 --> 0:2:56,934
President Lee:
Thank you.


44
0:2:56,934 --> 0:2:59,9
(speaking in Korean)


45
0:2:59,9 --> 0:3:2,233
(as translated in English)
Folks, I'm a little bit
shorter than President Obama,


46
0:3:2,233 --> 0:3:4,266
so I'm going to
adjust the microphone.


47
0:3:4,266 --> 0:3:4,734
(laughter)


48
0:3:4,734 --> 0:3:9,6
I hope you'll understand.


49
0:3:9,6 --> 0:3:20,867
(speaking in Korean)


50
0:3:20,867 --> 0:3:22,133
(as translated in English)
Well, first of all,
ladies and gentlemen,


51
0:3:22,133 --> 0:3:26,33
it's a great pleasure visiting
your factory here in Detroit


52
0:3:26,33 --> 0:3:30,367
along with one of my closest
friends, President Obama.


53
0:3:30,367 --> 0:3:50,266
(speaking in Korean)


54
0:3:50,266 --> 0:3:53,1
(as translated in English)
Well, folks, as you know, the
global economy is going through


55
0:3:53,1 --> 0:3:56,533
some tough times, and so there's
one thing on the minds of both


56
0:3:56,533 --> 0:3:59,467
President Obama and
I, and that is jobs.


57
0:3:59,467 --> 0:4:1,433
It is about creating
good, decent jobs,


58
0:4:1,433 --> 0:4:3,567
and it is about
keeping those jobs.


59
0:4:3,567 --> 0:4:5,767
And this is what keeps us awake.


60
0:4:5,767 --> 0:4:14,133
(applause)


61
0:4:14,133 --> 0:4:40,533
(speaking in Korean)


62
0:4:40,533 --> 0:4:43,33
(as translated in English)
Ladies and gentlemen, before
I came here to see you,


63
0:4:43,33 --> 0:4:45,633
I just had a brief tour given
to me by the members of this


64
0:4:45,633 --> 0:4:48,166
factory and I heard
about the history,


65
0:4:48,166 --> 0:4:51,33
and I also heard about the
danger of how this factory was


66
0:4:51,33 --> 0:4:52,9
on the brink of being closed.


67
0:4:52,9 --> 0:4:55,633
But now, as you can see, we
have so many people here,


68
0:4:55,633 --> 0:4:58,6
like all of you here working
here and earning a good living.


69
0:4:58,6 --> 0:5:1,4
And I think more than anyone
else here in this factory,


70
0:5:1,4 --> 0:5:4,2
I think it's President Obama
who's the happiest man to see


71
0:5:4,2 --> 0:5:7,133
this factory being so
energetic and enthusiastic.


72
0:5:7,133 --> 0:5:15,133
(applause)


73
0:5:15,133 --> 0:5:55,8
(speaking in Korean)


74
0:5:55,8 --> 0:5:58,266
(as translated in English)
Ladies and gentlemen, it was
three years ago when I first met


75
0:5:58,266 --> 0:6:1,4
with President Obama, and back
then I still remember how we


76
0:6:1,4 --> 0:6:2,6
talked about a lot of things.


77
0:6:2,6 --> 0:6:6,33
And one of the things that was
on President Obama's mind was


78
0:6:6,33 --> 0:6:9,66
how to revive the U.S.
automotive industry.


79
0:6:9,66 --> 0:6:11,967
Because we all know that the
U.S. automotive industry was,


80
0:6:11,967 --> 0:6:15,4
and is, the leader in the
world, and President Obama was


81
0:6:15,4 --> 0:6:19,133
concerned what he can do to
revive Motor City and the United


82
0:6:19,133 --> 0:6:20,734
States automotive industry.


83
0:6:20,734 --> 0:6:21,8
And we talked a lot about that.


84
0:6:21,8 --> 0:6:25,3
And, folks, I know a few things
about automobiles because back


85
0:6:25,3 --> 0:6:26,633
when I was in the
private sector,


86
0:6:26,633 --> 0:6:28,8
I used to build cars myself.


87
0:6:28,8 --> 0:6:30,7
So I know a thing or
two about automobiles,


88
0:6:30,7 --> 0:6:32,967
and I think perhaps this was
the reason why President Obama


89
0:6:32,967 --> 0:6:33,867
raised the subject.


90
0:6:33,867 --> 0:6:36,266
But we talked a lot about
how to revive the U.S.


91
0:6:36,266 --> 0:6:39,66
automobile industry.


92
0:6:39,66 --> 0:7:7,734
(speaking in Korean)


93
0:7:7,734 --> 0:7:10,533
(as translated in English)
Ladies and gentlemen, President
Obama just briefly talked about


94
0:7:10,533 --> 0:7:14,166
my past, how I really worked
hard throughout my life.


95
0:7:14,166 --> 0:7:18,667
And I was once just like you
-- I did work in factories,


96
0:7:18,667 --> 0:7:20,767
and I was also in the
boardroom, as well,


97
0:7:20,767 --> 0:7:23,9
as a CEO of one of the
largest companies in Korea.


98
0:7:23,9 --> 0:7:26,66
But one thing I learned
throughout my experience in my


99
0:7:26,66 --> 0:7:29,266
life is this: During
times of challenges,


100
0:7:29,266 --> 0:7:32,4
when you're faced with
difficulties and if you want to


101
0:7:32,4 --> 0:7:34,567
create good jobs and
maintain these good jobs,


102
0:7:34,567 --> 0:7:37,533
there's only one thing and the
surest way to do that is for the


103
0:7:37,533 --> 0:7:41,7
workers and for the
managers to work together.


104
0:7:41,7 --> 0:7:43,3
It is about
cooperating together,


105
0:7:43,3 --> 0:7:47,1
and that is the surest way to
ensure good jobs and for you to


106
0:7:47,1 --> 0:7:48,3
keep your jobs.


107
0:7:48,3 --> 0:7:57,767
(applause)


108
0:7:57,767 --> 0:8:37,5
(speaking in Korean)


109
0:8:37,5 --> 0:8:40,734
(as translated in English)
And, ladies and gentlemen, we
are here with President Obama


110
0:8:40,734 --> 0:8:44,867
because when I was a worker I
knew that, more than anything,


111
0:8:44,867 --> 0:8:48,734
for all of us to enjoy good life
is for all of us to have a good,


112
0:8:48,734 --> 0:8:49,667
decent job.


113
0:8:49,667 --> 0:8:53,433
And I know how important it
is for anyone to have a good,


114
0:8:53,433 --> 0:8:54,367
decent job.


115
0:8:54,367 --> 0:8:57,2
And the factory here --
as I was looking around,


116
0:8:57,2 --> 0:9:2,467
I felt once again how important
it is for all of us to work


117
0:9:2,467 --> 0:9:6,4
together because I know that
three years ago GM Korea and GM


118
0:9:6,4 --> 0:9:9,867
Orion, you guys worked together
to set up this factory.


119
0:9:9,867 --> 0:9:12,1
And today, you are building
models here and you're


120
0:9:12,1 --> 0:9:15,6
manufacturing cars
that three years ago,


121
0:9:15,6 --> 0:9:18,166
GM Korea and your company
has been working together.


122
0:9:18,166 --> 0:9:19,7
And that is the reason
why I came here,


123
0:9:19,7 --> 0:9:22,367
so I can see with my own eyes
the good work that all of you


124
0:9:22,367 --> 0:9:24,133
are doing here.


125
0:9:24,133 --> 0:9:32,3
(applause)


126
0:9:32,3 --> 0:10:1,433
(speaking in Korean)


127
0:10:1,433 --> 0:10:4,133
(as translated in English)
Folks, when I was President, as
soon as I became President of


128
0:10:4,133 --> 0:10:8,1
Korea, I visited a GM Korea
factory not once, but twice,


129
0:10:8,1 --> 0:10:11,567
which was quite unusual for the
President of Korea to do so.


130
0:10:11,567 --> 0:10:14,9
But I came here today -- and as
I watch the factory and I took


131
0:10:14,9 --> 0:10:18,767
on a tour, I was very, very --
deeply impressed by the way


132
0:10:18,767 --> 0:10:20,233
you're operating this factory.


133
0:10:20,233 --> 0:10:22,633
I was impressed by the
fact that this factory is


134
0:10:22,633 --> 0:10:24,2
very pro-environment.


135
0:10:24,2 --> 0:10:26,66
You take care of
the environment.


136
0:10:26,66 --> 0:10:28,467
Also you've adopted the
latest IT technology so that


137
0:10:28,467 --> 0:10:30,233
efficiency is up.


138
0:10:30,233 --> 0:10:32,734
You have the highest standards,
and you're building excellent


139
0:10:32,734 --> 0:10:34,4
cars here in this factory.


140
0:10:34,4 --> 0:10:37,533
And I am confident that this
factory is going to continue,


141
0:10:37,533 --> 0:10:39,2
and it's going to
make good cars,


142
0:10:39,2 --> 0:10:40,967
and your lives are
going to be good.


143
0:10:40,967 --> 0:10:44,367
And I'm sure -- and I'm
confident in the future.


144
0:10:44,367 --> 0:10:52,667
(applause)


145
0:10:52,667 --> 0:10:56,367
(speaking in Korean)


146
0:10:56,367 --> 0:11:0,6
(as translated in English)
Lastly, folks, I just want to
say one thing before I go.


147
0:11:0,6 --> 0:11:7,633
(speaking in Korean)


148
0:11:7,633 --> 0:11:12,367
(as translated in English)
As you know, the KORUS FTA
will soon be implemented.


149
0:11:12,367 --> 0:11:32,533
(speaking in Korean)


150
0:11:32,533 --> 0:11:35,433
(as translated in English)
I know, folks, that some of you
here may think that with the


151
0:11:35,433 --> 0:11:39,7
implementation of the KORUS FTA,
that somehow your jobs may be


152
0:11:39,7 --> 0:11:41,9
exported or go somewhere else.


153
0:11:41,9 --> 0:11:45,233
But let me tell you one
thing -- that is not true.


154
0:11:45,233 --> 0:11:52,633
(applause)


155
0:11:52,633 --> 0:11:56,2
I am here with President Obama
today because I want to give


156
0:11:56,2 --> 0:12:1,567
this promise to you, and that is
that the KORUS FTA will not take


157
0:12:1,567 --> 0:12:3,166
away any of your jobs.


158
0:12:3,166 --> 0:12:8,533
Rather it will create more
jobs for you and your family,


159
0:12:8,533 --> 0:12:10,734
and it is going to
protect your jobs.


160
0:12:10,734 --> 0:12:13,266
And this is the pledge
that I give you today.


161
0:12:13,266 --> 0:12:27,33
(applause)


162
0:12:27,33 --> 0:12:39,367
(speaking in Korean)


163
0:12:39,367 --> 0:12:42,367
(as translated in English)
Soon, folks, Motor City is
going to come back again,


164
0:12:42,367 --> 0:12:44,567
and it's going to
revive its past glory.


165
0:12:44,567 --> 0:12:47,2
And I have all the confidence
in the world that you are going


166
0:12:47,2 --> 0:12:49,0
to do that.


167
0:12:49,0 --> 0:12:49,9
(in English)
Thank you.


168
0:12:49,9 --> 0:13:0,567
(applause)


169
0:13:0,567 --> 0:13:2,4
President Obama:
Give President Lee a
big round of applause.


170
0:13:2,4 --> 0:13:11,834
(applause)


171
0:13:11,834 --> 0:13:13,0
All right.


172
0:13:13,0 --> 0:13:14,8
Well, thank you, President Lee.


173
0:13:14,8 --> 0:13:17,734
Thank you, to everybody who
has joined us here today.


174
0:13:17,734 --> 0:13:19,934
A couple of people I
just want to mention.


175
0:13:19,934 --> 0:13:24,33
First of all, the CEO of General
Motors, Dan Ackerson, is here.


176
0:13:24,33 --> 0:13:24,467
Where is Dan?


177
0:13:24,467 --> 0:13:25,633
(applause)


178
0:13:25,633 --> 0:13:30,3
There he is.


179
0:13:30,3 --> 0:13:34,133
The UAW President, one of the
key people who helped make this


180
0:13:34,133 --> 0:13:37,5
agreement possible -- that
is my dear friend, Bob King.


181
0:13:37,5 --> 0:13:44,567
(applause)


182
0:13:44,567 --> 0:13:47,0
And my U.S. Trade
Representative,


183
0:13:47,0 --> 0:13:51,533
who spent a lot of long nights
with his Korean counterpart --


184
0:13:51,533 --> 0:13:53,4
Ron Kirk is in the house.


185
0:13:53,4 --> 0:13:59,533
(applause)


186
0:13:59,533 --> 0:14:2,233
I just want to follow up
President Lee's remarks with a


187
0:14:2,233 --> 0:14:6,233
few words about what the Korea
Free Trade Agreement will mean


188
0:14:6,233 --> 0:14:11,734
for American jobs and
for the American economy.


189
0:14:11,734 --> 0:14:17,66
In the last decade, we became a
country that was known for what


190
0:14:17,66 --> 0:14:20,9
we bought and what we consumed.


191
0:14:20,9 --> 0:14:23,6
And a whole bunch of goods
poured in here from all around


192
0:14:23,6 --> 0:14:31,33
the world, and we spent a lot of
money and took on a lot of debt,


193
0:14:31,33 --> 0:14:35,133
in a lot of cases,
to buy those goods.


194
0:14:35,133 --> 0:14:37,4
But it didn't necessarily
produce a lot of jobs here in


195
0:14:37,4 --> 0:14:39,7
the United States.


196
0:14:39,7 --> 0:14:43,7
So when I took office, I was
determined to rebuild this


197
0:14:43,7 --> 0:14:48,367
economy based on what this
country has always done best --


198
0:14:48,367 --> 0:14:54,133
not just buying and consuming,
but building; making things,


199
0:14:54,133 --> 0:14:56,5
selling those goods
all around the world,


200
0:14:56,5 --> 0:14:59,467
stamped with three proud
words: Made in America.


201
0:14:59,467 --> 0:15:7,734
(applause)


202
0:15:7,734 --> 0:15:10,2
And that's why one of the
first decisions that I made as


203
0:15:10,2 --> 0:15:14,1
President was to save the U.S.
auto industry from collapse.


204
0:15:14,1 --> 0:15:32,33
(applause)


205
0:15:32,33 --> 0:15:33,934
There were a lot of politicians
who said it wasn't worth the


206
0:15:33,934 --> 0:15:36,567
time and wasn't worth the money.


207
0:15:36,567 --> 0:15:41,734
In fact, there are some
politicians who still say that.


208
0:15:41,734 --> 0:15:46,1
Well, they should come tell that
to the workers here at Orion.


209
0:15:46,1 --> 0:15:48,0
Audience:
Yes!


210
0:15:48,0 --> 0:15:51,8
President Obama:
Because two years ago it looked
like this plant was going to


211
0:15:51,8 --> 0:15:54,3
have to shut its doors.


212
0:15:54,3 --> 0:15:55,767
All these jobs would
have been lost.


213
0:15:55,767 --> 0:15:59,233
The entire community would
have been devastated.


214
0:15:59,233 --> 0:16:1,66
And the same was true
for communities all across


215
0:16:1,66 --> 0:16:3,667
the Midwest.


216
0:16:3,667 --> 0:16:5,5
And I refused to
let that happen.


217
0:16:5,5 --> 0:16:12,333
(applause)


218
0:16:12,333 --> 0:16:14,967
So we made a deal with
the auto companies.


219
0:16:14,967 --> 0:16:19,5
We said if you're willing
to retool and restructure,


220
0:16:19,5 --> 0:16:22,834
get more efficient, get
better, get smarter,


221
0:16:22,834 --> 0:16:25,867
then we're going to
invest in your future --


222
0:16:25,867 --> 0:16:28,467
because we believe in
American ingenuity.


223
0:16:28,467 --> 0:16:31,667
Most importantly, we
believe in American workers.


224
0:16:31,667 --> 0:16:34,967
(applause)


225
0:16:34,967 --> 0:16:36,967
And today, I can stand
here and say that the


226
0:16:36,967 --> 0:16:38,367
investment paid off.


227
0:16:38,367 --> 0:16:46,5
(applause)


228
0:16:46,5 --> 0:16:49,9
The hundreds of thousands of
jobs that have been saved made


229
0:16:49,9 --> 0:16:51,166
it worth it.


230
0:16:51,166 --> 0:16:52,367
Audience:
Yes!


231
0:16:52,367 --> 0:16:55,767
President Obama:
An American auto industry that's
more profitable and competitive


232
0:16:55,767 --> 0:16:58,233
than it's been in
years made it worth it.


233
0:16:58,233 --> 0:17:0,934
(applause)


234
0:17:0,934 --> 0:17:3,5
The taxpayers are being repaid.


235
0:17:3,5 --> 0:17:5,367
(applause)


236
0:17:5,367 --> 0:17:7,867
Plants like this are
churning out groundbreaking


237
0:17:7,867 --> 0:17:11,66
fuel-efficient cars
like the Chevy Sonic --


238
0:17:11,66 --> 0:17:14,233
the only one of its kind that's
made and sold in the United


239
0:17:14,233 --> 0:17:15,2
States of America.


240
0:17:15,2 --> 0:17:29,6
(applause)


241
0:17:29,6 --> 0:17:30,834
And for folks who
haven't tried it,


242
0:17:30,834 --> 0:17:31,667
you've got to sit in that car.


243
0:17:31,667 --> 0:17:32,734
There's a lot of room in there.


244
0:17:32,734 --> 0:17:34,567
(laughter)


245
0:17:34,567 --> 0:17:39,4
Felt -- even for a pretty tall
guy like me, I felt pretty good.


246
0:17:39,4 --> 0:17:40,333
They took away the keys, though.


247
0:17:40,333 --> 0:17:41,266
Secret Service
wouldn't let me --


248
0:17:41,266 --> 0:17:42,834
(laughter)


249
0:17:42,834 --> 0:17:45,4
-- I checked in the dash.


250
0:17:45,4 --> 0:17:48,233
It wasn't there.


251
0:17:48,233 --> 0:17:48,934
Now, here's the thing.


252
0:17:48,934 --> 0:17:54,0
We live in a global economy, and
that means most of the potential


253
0:17:54,0 --> 0:17:59,633
customers for American companies
like GM won't just be here in


254
0:17:59,633 --> 0:18:3,7
the United States; they'll
be all around the world.


255
0:18:3,7 --> 0:18:8,533
And the more goods and
services we sell abroad,


256
0:18:8,533 --> 0:18:10,567
the more jobs we
create here at home.


257
0:18:10,567 --> 0:18:15,133
(applause)


258
0:18:15,133 --> 0:18:20,4
In fact, every $1 billion in
exports supports thousands of


259
0:18:20,4 --> 0:18:22,6
American jobs.


260
0:18:22,6 --> 0:18:25,533
And that's why I've set a goal
of doubling our exports -- and


261
0:18:25,533 --> 0:18:28,367
that's a goal that
we're on track to meet.


262
0:18:28,367 --> 0:18:30,533
That's why we worked
with Panama and Colombia,


263
0:18:30,533 --> 0:18:34,967
as well as South Korea, to
resolve outstanding issues with


264
0:18:34,967 --> 0:18:37,166
these trade agreements, and
that's why I pushed Congress to


265
0:18:37,166 --> 0:18:39,7
pass them as soon as possible.


266
0:18:39,7 --> 0:18:41,767
(applause)


267
0:18:41,767 --> 0:18:45,433
Now, Korea is one that
is critically important,


268
0:18:45,433 --> 0:18:49,433
because understand Korea
has 50 million people;


269
0:18:49,433 --> 0:18:52,333
it's one of the fastest-growing
countries in the world.


270
0:18:52,333 --> 0:18:56,7
It's one of our closest allies
and our closest friends.


271
0:18:56,7 --> 0:18:59,7
And -- President Lee and I
talked about this when we had


272
0:18:59,7 --> 0:19:3,867
dinner the other night -- our
trade is basically balanced


273
0:19:3,867 --> 0:19:6,266
between the United
States and Korea.


274
0:19:6,266 --> 0:19:10,9
They buy as much stuff from
us as they sell to us --


275
0:19:10,9 --> 0:19:14,4
and that's how fair and free
trade is supposed to be.


276
0:19:14,4 --> 0:19:16,3
It's not a one-sided
proposition.


277
0:19:16,3 --> 0:19:21,967
(applause)


278
0:19:21,967 --> 0:19:23,7
That's how trade
is supposed to be.


279
0:19:23,7 --> 0:19:25,834
And I know President Lee
doesn't mind me saying this,


280
0:19:25,834 --> 0:19:28,4
even though he's a Hyundai guy.


281
0:19:28,4 --> 0:19:29,734
(laughter)


282
0:19:29,734 --> 0:19:33,533
If Americans can buy Kias
and Hyundais from Korea,


283
0:19:33,533 --> 0:19:35,934
then I know Koreans should be
able to buy some Fords and


284
0:19:35,934 --> 0:19:38,934
Chryslers and Chevys that are
made right here in the United


285
0:19:38,934 --> 0:19:39,867
States of America.


286
0:19:39,867 --> 0:19:46,767
(applause)


287
0:19:46,767 --> 0:19:47,9
The other thing
that happened was --


288
0:19:47,9 --> 0:19:51,567
this took a little longer than
some people expected because I


289
0:19:51,567 --> 0:19:55,2
wasn't going to sign
just any trade deal.


290
0:19:55,2 --> 0:19:57,233
President Lee wasn't either.


291
0:19:57,233 --> 0:20:0,967
We had to work hard to
reach an understanding.


292
0:20:0,967 --> 0:20:4,1
It was like a scene
from a GM dealership,


293
0:20:4,1 --> 0:20:7,433
where folks are negotiating
about the heated seats and the


294
0:20:7,433 --> 0:20:10,533
extended warranty, and you're
going back and forth and trying


295
0:20:10,533 --> 0:20:12,734
to figure how does it fit
together so that it works


296
0:20:12,734 --> 0:20:14,934
for everybody.


297
0:20:14,934 --> 0:20:19,66
But when all was said and done,
President Lee and I walked away


298
0:20:19,66 --> 0:20:22,4
with a trade agreement that
is a win-win for both of


299
0:20:22,4 --> 0:20:23,734
our countries.


300
0:20:23,734 --> 0:20:29,66
(applause)


301
0:20:29,66 --> 0:20:32,9
Here in the United States, this
trade agreement will support at


302
0:20:32,9 --> 0:20:36,3
least 70,000 American jobs.


303
0:20:36,3 --> 0:20:38,7
It will increase exports.


304
0:20:38,7 --> 0:20:42,1
It will boost our economy by
more than our last nine trade


305
0:20:42,1 --> 0:20:43,533
agreements combined.


306
0:20:43,533 --> 0:20:48,8
And as I said, the good thing is
we've got a balanced situation.


307
0:20:48,8 --> 0:20:51,0
It's not just a matter of folks
sending a bunch of stuff here.


308
0:20:51,0 --> 0:20:53,867
Koreans are also buying
American products.


309
0:20:53,867 --> 0:20:55,266
That's what makes it a win-win.


310
0:20:55,266 --> 0:21:1,367
(applause)


311
0:21:1,367 --> 0:21:6,66
And by the way, I also held out
on sending this agreement to


312
0:21:6,66 --> 0:21:11,133
Congress until they promised to
renew a law called the TAA --


313
0:21:11,133 --> 0:21:14,4
Trade Adjustment Assistance --
that helps American workers


314
0:21:14,4 --> 0:21:17,967
who've been affected by global
competition so that they are


315
0:21:17,967 --> 0:21:20,33
able to help transition.


316
0:21:20,33 --> 0:21:21,834
(applause)


317
0:21:21,834 --> 0:21:26,0
Now, it's because of
all these benefits --


318
0:21:26,0 --> 0:21:27,934
it's because of all these
benefits that this trade


319
0:21:27,934 --> 0:21:31,934
agreement won the support
of business and labor,


320
0:21:31,934 --> 0:21:35,8
from automakers
and auto workers,


321
0:21:35,8 --> 0:21:39,667
from Democrats and Republicans.


322
0:21:39,667 --> 0:21:41,633
That doesn't happen very often.


323
0:21:41,633 --> 0:21:45,667
And it was good to finally see
both parties in Congress come


324
0:21:45,667 --> 0:21:50,433
together and pass legislation
that is good for the American


325
0:21:50,433 --> 0:21:54,3
people -- an agreement that will
not only build on our strong


326
0:21:54,3 --> 0:21:58,533
economic relationship that's
been existing for years to come,


327
0:21:58,533 --> 0:22:2,2
but also promises, as
we've seen at this plant,


328
0:22:2,2 --> 0:22:5,9
the capacity for us to exchange
ideas and technologies and


329
0:22:5,9 --> 0:22:13,8
systems, which will improve
productivity on both sides.


330
0:22:13,8 --> 0:22:17,734
Nearly a decade ago, when a
Korean business named Daewoo


331
0:22:17,734 --> 0:22:21,967
Motors went bankrupt, it was
General Motors that stepped in


332
0:22:21,967 --> 0:22:27,934
and saved that company, which
is now known as GM Korea.


333
0:22:27,934 --> 0:22:31,934
And years later, it was the
engineers from GM Korea who


334
0:22:31,934 --> 0:22:35,767
helped make the
Chevy Sonic possible,


335
0:22:35,767 --> 0:22:38,7
and the collaboration with that
company that's helped save this


336
0:22:38,7 --> 0:22:46,7
plant and these
17,050 -- 1,750 jobs.


337
0:22:46,7 --> 0:22:49,934
So on a larger scale, the closer
economic ties between the United


338
0:22:49,934 --> 0:22:53,834
States and Korea are going
to lead to more jobs,


339
0:22:53,834 --> 0:22:57,233
more opportunity
for both nations.


340
0:22:57,233 --> 0:22:57,834
(applause)


341
0:22:57,834 --> 0:23:2,233
Already, Korean investment
-- and by the way,


342
0:23:2,233 --> 0:23:4,3
it's not just in
the auto industry.


343
0:23:4,3 --> 0:23:7,0
Already, Korean investment is
creating jobs here in Michigan,


344
0:23:7,0 --> 0:23:11,834
with LG Chem planning to make
lithium ion batteries in


345
0:23:11,834 --> 0:23:16,633
Holland, Michigan; and Hyundai
manufacturing suspension modules


346
0:23:16,633 --> 0:23:20,767
in Detroit; and Mando opening
a new research and development


347
0:23:20,767 --> 0:23:24,667
center for brakes
and steering in Novi.


348
0:23:24,667 --> 0:23:27,967
In Korea, American businesses
are going to be pursuing those


349
0:23:27,967 --> 0:23:32,467
same investments
and opportunities.


350
0:23:32,467 --> 0:23:35,8
So it's truly a win-win
for everybody involved.


351
0:23:35,8 --> 0:23:39,8
So I just want to say thank
you to President Lee for his


352
0:23:39,8 --> 0:23:43,233
cooperation and
for his leadership.


353
0:23:43,233 --> 0:23:45,834
I want to thank the members of
Congress who fought so hard to


354
0:23:45,834 --> 0:23:50,7
get this done -- especially
the delegation from this state.


355
0:23:50,7 --> 0:23:54,6
I want to especially thank the
people of Detroit for proving


356
0:23:54,6 --> 0:23:58,767
that, despite all the
work that lies ahead,


357
0:23:58,767 --> 0:24:1,667
this is a city where a great
American industry is coming


358
0:24:1,667 --> 0:24:2,8
back to life --


359
0:24:2,8 --> 0:24:3,533
(applause)


360
0:24:3,533 --> 0:24:8,6
-- and the industries of
tomorrow are taking root,


361
0:24:8,6 --> 0:24:11,934
and a city where people are
dreaming up ways to prove all


362
0:24:11,934 --> 0:24:15,967
the skeptics wrong and write the
next proud chapter in the Motor


363
0:24:15,967 --> 0:24:17,33
City's history.


364
0:24:17,33 --> 0:24:18,133
(applause)


365
0:24:18,133 --> 0:24:20,667
And that's why I
came here today.


366
0:24:20,667 --> 0:24:23,734
Because for every cynic that's
out there running around saying


367
0:24:23,734 --> 0:24:26,7
it can't be done, there are a
whole bunch of folks that are


368
0:24:26,7 --> 0:24:27,867
saying, "Yes, we can."


369
0:24:27,867 --> 0:24:33,5
(applause)


370
0:24:33,5 --> 0:24:36,533
Yes, times are tough.


371
0:24:36,533 --> 0:24:38,767
Times are tough and they've been
tougher in Detroit than just


372
0:24:38,767 --> 0:24:41,233
about anyplace else.


373
0:24:41,233 --> 0:24:44,367
But we've made it through
tough times before.


374
0:24:44,367 --> 0:24:46,4
We do not quit.


375
0:24:46,4 --> 0:24:48,3
We've rolled up our sleeves.


376
0:24:48,3 --> 0:24:50,266
We remembered our history.


377
0:24:50,266 --> 0:24:54,166
And we said to ourselves there's
nothing that we cannot do when


378
0:24:54,166 --> 0:24:57,0

These cars are a testimony
to the American spirit.


382
0:25:5,266 --> 0:25:8,934
And if we can take that same
spirit and apply it across the

0:25:8,934 --> 0:25:11,767
board to all the
challenges we face,


384
0:25:11,767 --> 0:25:14,2

that we cannot do.

God bless you.


386
0:25:14,9 --> 0:25:16,767
And God bless the United
