1
0:0:0,26 --> 0:0:14,229
how lucky they are.


2
0:0:14,229 --> 0:0:21,57
Because the settlers also bring bees with them for their honey.


3
0:0:21,57 --> 0:0:25,469
The native American bee pollinates only a few species,


4
0:0:25,469 --> 0:0:43,93
but European honey bees can live almost everywhere and pollinate any plant in sight.


5
0:0:43,93 --> 0:0:48,7
Gardens turn into plantations


6
0:0:48,7 --> 0:0:54,55
for consumption at home and abroad.


7
0:0:54,55 --> 0:0:55,849
Apples thrive


8
0:0:55,849 --> 0:1:0,4
and become a major
industry in North America,


9
0:1:0,4 --> 0:1:5,979
eventually yielding a harvest of five million tons a year,


10
0:1:5,979 --> 0:1:7,6
all beginning


11
0:1:7,6 --> 0:1:16,95
with European seedlings.


12
0:1:16,95 --> 0:1:27,3
This is biological imperialism in full swing.


13
0:1:27,3 --> 0:1:28,479
Europe's fruits


14
0:1:28,479 --> 0:1:54,81
and vegetables conquer the new world.


15
0:1:54,81 --> 0:1:57,619
But it is also an exchange.


16
0:1:57,619 --> 0:2:0,3
It is of the Columbian Exchange.


17
0:2:0,3 --> 0:2:6,31
European kitchens may not see native meat from America, bison or lama,


18
0:2:6,31 --> 0:2:20,239
but new world vegetables make a big impact.


19
0:2:20,239 --> 0:2:24,739
The plant with the greatest impact on Europe needs a couple of centuries to


20
0:2:24,739 --> 0:2:37,49
take root in its culture.


21
0:2:37,49 --> 0:2:42,669
"This tuber is insipid and mealy and cannot be classed among the agreeable


22
0:2:42,669 --> 0:2:48,669
foodstuffs but it's furnishes abundant and rather wholesome nutrition to men


23
0:2:48,669 --> 0:2:51,109
who are content to be nourished.


24
0:2:51,109 --> 0:2:57,549
It is justly regarded as flatulent but what are winds to the vigorous organs of


25
0:2:57,549 --> 0:3:0,549
peasants and labourers?"


26
0:3:0,549 --> 0:3:20,229
wrote Diderot in his Encyclopedia in the eighteenth century.


27
0:3:20,229 --> 0:3:21,889
Introduced into Spain


28
0:3:21,889 --> 0:3:27,319
potatoes slowly spread to Italy and to northern and eastern Europe.


29
0:3:27,319 --> 0:3:32,449
By sixteen hundred the potatoes enter Austria, Holland, France, Switzerland,


30
0:3:32,449 --> 0:3:34,619
England and Germany.


31
0:3:34,619 --> 0:3:40,539
Frederick the Great himself urges its cultivation in Prussia.


32
0:3:40,539 --> 0:3:44,909
But it is the Irish who adopt the potato with open arms.


33
0:3:44,909 --> 0:3:48,269
They have a limited food supply and grain grown here has often been


34
0:3:48,269 --> 0:3:54,929
destroyed or burned as the result of war.


35
0:3:54,929 --> 0:3:57,329
But the potato safely under ground


36
0:3:57,329 --> 0:4:0,129
survives these hardships.


37
0:4:0,129 --> 0:4:3,369
In one hundred years Irish population


38
0:4:3,369 --> 0:4:12,919
more than doubles.


39
0:4:12,919 --> 0:4:17,75
And towns like Berlin grow into great cities.


40
0:4:17,75 --> 0:4:19,549
By 1700


41
0:4:19,549 --> 0:4:24,97
there is an unprecedented population explosion in Europe,


42
0:4:24,97 --> 0:4:37,88
thanks to a plant from the faraway Andes.


43
0:4:37,88 --> 0:4:44,699
Only one domestic animal from the new world sets foot in Europe:


44
0:4:44,699 --> 0:4:49,669
the turkey.


45
0:4:49,669 --> 0:4:54,6
Turkey and a few vegetables enhance the European diet, but otherwise


46
0:4:54,6 --> 0:4:57,61
their life is relatively unchanged.


47
0:4:57,61 --> 0:4:59,936
So why was the Columbian Exchange so one-sided?


48
0:4:59,936 --> 0:5:3,6
Why did it go primarily in one direction from Europe to America?


49
0:5:3,6 --> 0:5:7,32
With the exception of things like potatoes and potato blight,


50
0:5:7,32 --> 0:5:11,199
why was Europe not overtaken by American plants and animals?


51
0:5:11,199 --> 0:5:14,49
It's difficult to say why something did not happen,


52
0:5:14,49 --> 0:5:16,419
but you have to remember that


53
0:5:16,419 --> 0:5:18,95
the ecological invasion was a cooperative enterprise,


54
0:5:18,95 --> 0:5:21,479
disease and plants and
animals working together


55
0:5:21,479 --> 0:5:26,77
and Europe remained densely-populated and didn't have diseases depopulate its people


56
0:5:26,77 --> 0:5:31,249
and so you didn't have niches open up for livestock to graze


57
0:5:31,249 --> 0:5:35,889
and then weeds to take over the areas that livestock had overgrazed and trampled,


58
0:5:35,889 --> 0:5:47,149
so that that critical part it worked in one direction primarily.


59
0:5:47,149 --> 0:5:51,81
The European elites want more than just turkeys and potatoes from the new world,


60
0:5:51,81 --> 0:6:1,169
they want luxury products.


61
0:6:1,169 --> 0:6:2,66
Sugar and tobacco,


62
0:6:2,66 --> 0:6:22,389
meet the requirements
of the upper class.


63
0:6:22,389 --> 0:6:27,589
The first British settlers quickly acquire a taste for American tobacco


64
0:6:27,589 --> 0:6:36,5
and export large shipments to Europe.


65
0:6:36,5 --> 0:6:38,99
To satisfy such high demand


66
0:6:38,99 --> 0:6:48,599
settlers build immense plantations.


67
0:6:48,599 --> 0:6:53,99
Growing sugar becomes a business on the same scale as tobacco.


68
0:6:53,99 --> 0:7:1,21
The new model cultures cover entire landscapes.


69
0:7:1,21 --> 0:7:8,189
For this sole purpose some ten million Africans are transported to America


70
0:7:8,189 --> 0:7:18,189
and enslaved to cultivate luxury items for Americans and Europeans.


71
0:7:18,189 --> 0:7:21,472
Because of the rapid depopulation of the Americas owing to disease,


72
0:7:21,472 --> 0:7:24,109
Europeans faced a shortage of labour in their effort to exploit


73
0:7:24,109 --> 0:7:27,509
the resources of the new world particularly to exploit the soil,


74
0:7:27,509 --> 0:7:32,139
so the Europeans, first the Portuguese and then the Dutch and then eventually the English


75
0:7:32,139 --> 0:7:37,219
imported slaves from west Africa to cultivate sugar in the Caribbean and Brazil,


76
0:7:37,219 --> 0:7:40,379
tobacco in Virginia, rice in South Carolina and by the nineteenth century


77
0:7:40,379 --> 0:7:42,83
in mainland North America,


78
0:7:42,83 --> 0:7:45,199
it's no exaggeration to say that


79
0:7:45,199 --> 0:7:46,77
these cash commodities


80
0:7:46,77 --> 0:7:52,849
produced by slave labour were central to the export economies of the Americas.


81
0:7:52,849 --> 0:8:4,24
By the eighteenth century the metamorphosis of much of America is complete.


82
0:8:4,24 --> 0:8:9,699
New Spain and New England are fully established.


83
0:8:9,699 --> 0:8:12,919
Nature has been transformed


84
0:8:12,919 --> 0:8:27,43
and is in the hands of man.


85
0:8:27,43 --> 0:8:35,57
Now pioneers are heading west.


86
0:8:35,57 --> 0:8:44,89
There is still empty land in that direction.


87
0:8:44,89 --> 0:8:47,34
They will complete what was begun


88
0:8:47,34 --> 0:8:56,21
in the east.


89
0:8:56,21 --> 0:8:58,52
In the creation of the new world


90
0:8:58,52 --> 0:9:3,39
perhaps ninety percent of the native American people died.


91
0:9:3,39 --> 0:9:5,49
The people who took their place


92
0:9:5,49 --> 0:9:8,4
came from all over Europe,


93
0:9:8,4 --> 0:9:10,65
as conquistadors,


94
0:9:10,65 --> 0:9:13,46
settlers,


95
0:9:13,46 --> 0:9:16,19
explorers,


96
0:9:16,19 --> 0:9:22,86
and colonists.


97
0:9:22,86 --> 0:9:29,61
And they came from Africa as slaves.


98
0:9:29,61 --> 0:9:34,59
But it was the transfer of animals and plants from Europe to the Americas


99
0:9:34,59 --> 0:9:53,62
that really made the creation of the new world possible.


100
0:9:53,62 --> 0:9:56,45
In today's chrome and steel cities


101
0:9:56,45 --> 0:9:59,76
we sometimes seem so cut off from Nature


102
0:9:59,76 --> 0:10:4,6
that it may be difficult to believe the Columbian Exchange ever happened.


103
0:10:4,6 --> 0:10:7,98
But in the final analysis the skyscrapers


104
0:10:7,98 --> 0:10:11,3
and the melting pot of the races


105
0:10:11,3 --> 0:10:14,29
owe their existence not only to humans


106
0:10:14,29 --> 0:10:21,55
but also to the natural world.


107
0:10:21,55 --> 0:10:24,69
People came to the Americas for many reasons. Some came to make money,


108
0:10:24,69 --> 0:10:28,42
some came for religious freedom, some came involuntarily as slaves


109
0:10:28,42 --> 0:10:30,26
but those populations took hold


110
0:10:30,26 --> 0:10:33,75
in the Americas because of the accident of ecology,


111
0:10:33,75 --> 0:10:37,28
because of the microbes, the plants, the animals that they brought with them gave them


112
0:10:37,28 --> 0:10:39,77
an advantage over the people who were already here.


113
0:10:39,77 --> 0:10:40,8
And the legacy


114
0:10:40,8 --> 0:10:45,49
of the Columbian Exchange is also still largely biological,


115
0:10:45,49 --> 0:10:53,5
and that legacy will continue into the future.


116
0:10:53,5 --> 0:10:57,41
It all  began five hundred years ago,


117
0:10:57,41 --> 0:10:58,36
Columbus


118
0:10:58,36 --> 0:11:1,89
had a vision


119
0:11:1,89 --> 0:11:7,16
and three ships set out in a quest for India


120
0:11:7,16 --> 0:13:7,16
and found the new world.
